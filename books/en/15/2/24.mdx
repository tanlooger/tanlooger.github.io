title: 24 VOTE
---

HE WAS NOT PLEASED, THAT MUCH WAS EASY TO READ IN his face. But, without further argument, he took me in his arms and sprang lithely from my window, landing without the slightest jolt, like a cat. It was a little bit farther down than I’d imagined.

“All right then,” he said, his voice seething with disapproval. “Up you go.”

He helped me onto his back, and took off running. Even after all this time, it felt routine. Easy. Evidently this was something you never forgot, like riding a bicycle.

It was so very quiet and dark as he ran through the forest, his breathing slow and even—dark enough that the trees flying past us were nearly invisible, and only the rush of air in my face truly gave away our speed. The air was damp; it didn’t burn my eyes the way the wind in the big plaza had, and that was comforting. As was the night, too, after that terrifying brightness. Like the thick quilt I’d played under as a child, the dark felt familiar and protecting.

I remembered that running through the forest like this used to frighten me, that I used to have to close my eyes. It seemed a silly reaction to me now. I kept my eyes wide, my chin resting on his shoulder, my cheek against his neck. The speed was exhilarating. A hundred times better than the motorcycle.

I turned my face toward him and pressed my lips into the cold stone skin of his neck.

“Thank you,” he said, as the vague, black shapes of trees raced past us. “Does that mean you’ve decided you’re awake?”

I laughed. The sound was easy, natural, effortless. It sounded right. “Not really. More that, either way, I’m not trying to wake up. Not tonight.”

“I’ll earn your trust back somehow,” he murmured, mostly to himself. “If it’s my final act.”

“I trust you,” I assured him. “It’s me I don’t trust.”

“Explain that, please.”

He’d slowed to a walk—I could only tell because the wind ceased—and I guessed that we weren’t far from the house. In fact, I thought I could make out the sound of the river rushing somewhere close by in the darkness.

“Well—” I struggled to find the right way to phrase it. “I don’t trust myself to be...enough. To deserve you. There’s nothing about me that could hold you.”

He stopped and reached around to pull me from his back. His gentle hands did not release me; after he’d set me on my feet again, he wrapped his arms tightly around me, hugging me to his chest.

“Your hold is permanent and unbreakable,” he whispered. “Never doubt that.”

But how could I not?

“You never did tell me...,” he murmured.

“What?”

“What your greatest problem is.”

“I’ll give you one guess.” I sighed, and reached up to touch the tip of his nose with my index finger.

He nodded. “I’m worse than the Volturi,” he said grimly. “I guess I’ve earned that.”

I rolled my eyes. “The worst the Volturi can do is kill me.”

He waited with tense eyes.

“You can leave me,” I explained. “The Volturi, Victoria...they’re nothing compared to that.”

Even in the darkness, I could see the anguish twist his face—it reminded me of his expression under Jane’s torturing gaze; I felt sick, and regretted speaking the truth.

“Don’t,” I whispered, touching his face. “Don’t be sad.”

He pulled one corner of his mouth up halfheartedly, but the expression didn’t touch his eyes. “If there was only some way to make you see that I can’t leave you,” he whispered. “Time, I suppose, will be the way to convince you.”

I liked the idea of time. “Okay,” I agreed.

His face was still tormented. I tried to distract him with inconsequentials.

“So—since you’re staying. Can I have my stuff back?” I asked, making my tone as light as I could manage.

My attempt worked, to an extent: he laughed. But his eyes retained the misery. “Your things were never gone,” he told me. “I knew it was wrong, since I promised you peace without reminders. It was stupid and childish, but I wanted to leave something of myself with you. The CD, the pictures, the tickets—they’re all under your floorboards.”

“Really?”

He nodded, seeming slightly cheered by my obvious pleasure in this trivial fact. It wasn’t enough to heal the pain in his face completely.

“I think,” I said slowly, “I’m not sure, but I wonder... I think maybe I knew it the whole time.”

“What did you know?”

I only wanted to take away the agony in his eyes, but as I spoke the words, they sounded truer than I expected they would.

“Some part of me, my subconscious maybe, never stopped believing that you still cared whether I lived or died. That’s probably why I was hearing the voices.”

There was a very deep silence for a moment. “Voices?” he asked flatly.

“Well, just one voice. Yours. It’s a long story.” The wary look on his face made me wish that I hadn’t brought that up. Would he think I was crazy, like everyone else? Was everyone else right about that? But at least that expression—the one that made him look like something was burning him—faded.

“I’ve got time.” His voice was unnaturally even.

“It’s pretty pathetic.”

He waited.

I wasn’t sure how to explain. “Do you remember what Alice said about extreme sports?”

He spoke the words without inflection or emphasis. “You jumped off a cliff for fun.”

“Er, right. And before that, with the motorcycle—”

“Motorcycle?” he asked. I knew his voice well enough to hear something brewing behind the calm.

“I guess I didn’t tell Alice about that part.”

“No.”

“Well, about that...See, I found that...when I was doing something dangerous or stupid...I could remember you more clearly,” I confessed, feeling completely mental. “I could remember how your voice sounded when you were angry. I could hear it, like you were standing right there next to me. Mostly I tried not to think about you, but this didn’t hurt so much—it was like you were protecting me again. Like you didn’t want me to be hurt.

“And, well, I wonder if the reason I could hear you so clearly was because, underneath it all, I always knew that you hadn’t stopped loving me.”

Again, as I spoke, the words brought with them a sense of conviction. Of rightness. Some deep place inside me recognized truth.

His words came out half-strangled. “You...were...risking your life...to hear—”

“Shh,” I interrupted him. “Hold on a second. I think I’m having an epiphany here.”

I thought of that night in Port Angeles when I’d had my first delusion. I’d come up with two options. Insanity or wish fulfillment. I’d seen no third option.

But what if...

What if you sincerely believed something was true, but you were dead wrong? What if you were so stubbornly sure that you were right, that you wouldn’t even consider the truth? Would the truth be silenced, or would it try to break through?

Option three: Edward loved me. The bond forged between us was not one that could be broken by absence, distance, or time. And no matter how much more special or beautiful or brilliant or perfect than me he might be,he was as irreversibly altered as I was. As I would always belong to him, so would he always be mine.

Was that what I’d been trying to tell myself?

“Oh!”

“Bella?”

“Oh. Okay. I see.”

“Your epiphany?” he asked, his voice uneven and strained.

“You love me,” I marveled. The sense of conviction and rightness washed through me again.

Though his eyes were still anxious, the crooked smile I loved best flashed across his face. “Truly, I do.”

My heart inflated like it was going to crack right through my ribs. It filled my chest and blocked my throat so that I could not speak.

He really did want me the way I wanted him—forever. It was only fear for my soul, for the human things he didn’t want to take from me, that made him so desperate to leave me mortal. Compared to the fear that he didn’t want me, this hurdle—my soul—seemed almost insignificant.

He took my face tightly between his cool hands and kissed me until I was so dizzy the forest was spinning. Then he leaned his forehead against mine, and I was not the only one breathing harder than usual.

“You were better at it than I was, you know,” he told me.

“Better at what?”

“Surviving. You, at least, made an effort. You got up in the morning, tried to be normal for Charlie, followed the pattern of your life. When I wasn’t actively tracking, I was...totally useless. I couldn’t be around my family—I couldn’t be around anyone. I’m embarrassed to admit that I more or less curled up into a ball and let the misery have me.” He grinned, sheepish. “It was much more pathetic than hearing voices. And, of course, you know I do that, too.”

I was deeply relieved that he really seemed to understand—comforted that this all made sense to him. At any rate, he wasn’t looking at me like I was crazy. He was looking at me like...he loved me.

“I only heard one voice,” I corrected him.

He laughed and then pulled me tight against his right side and started to lead me forward.

“I’m just humoring you with this.” He motioned broadly with his hand toward the darkness in front of us as we walked. There was something pale and immense there—the house, I realized. “It doesn’t matter in the slightest what they say.”

“This affects them now, too.”

He shrugged indifferently.

He led me through the open front door into the dark house and flipped the lights on. The room was just as I’d remembered it—the piano and the white couches and the pale, massive staircase. No dust, no white sheets.

Edward called out the names with no more volume than I’d use in regular conversation. “Carlisle? Esme? Rosalie? Emmett? Jasper? Alice?” They would hear.

Carlisle was suddenly standing beside me, as if he’d been there all along. “Welcome back, Bella.” He smiled. “What can we do for you this morning? I imagine, due to the hour, that this is not a purely social visit?”

I nodded. “I’d like to talk to everyone at once, if that’s okay. About something important.”

I couldn’t help glancing up at Edward’s face as I spoke. His expression was critical, but resigned. When I looked back to Carlisle, he was looking at Edward, too.

“Of course,” Carlisle said. “Why don’t we talk in the other room?”

Carlisle led the way through the bright living room, around the corner to the dining room, turning on lights as he went. The walls were white, the ceilings high, like the living room. In the center of the room, under the low-hanging chandelier, was a large, polished oval table surrounded by eight chairs. Carlisle held out a chair for me at the head.

I’d never seen the Cullens use the dining room table before—it was just a prop. They didn’t eat in the house.

As soon as I turned to sit in the chair, I saw that we were not alone. Esme had followed Edward, and behind her the rest of the family filed in.

Carlisle sat down on my right, and Edward on my left. Everyone else took their seats in silence. Alice was grinning at me, already in on the plot. Emmett and Jasper looked curious, and Rosalie smiled at me tentatively. My answering smile was just as timid. That was going to take some getting used to.

Carlisle nodded toward me. “The floor is yours.”

I swallowed. Their gazing eyes made me nervous. Edward took my hand under the table. I peeked at him, but he was watching the others, his face suddenly fierce.

“Well,” I paused. “I’m hoping Alice has already told you everything that happened in Volterra?”

“Everything,” Alice assured me.

I threw her a meaningful look. “And on the way?”

“That, too,” she nodded.

“Good,” I sighed with relief. “Then we’re all on the same page.”

They waited patiently while I tried to order my thoughts.

“So, I have a problem,” I began. “Alice promised the Volturi that I would become one of you. They’re going to send someone to check, and I’m sure that’s a bad thing—something to avoid.

“And so, now, this involves you all. I’m sorry about that.” I looked at each one of their beautiful faces, saving the most beautiful for last. Edward’s mouth was turned down into a grimace. “But, if you don’t want me, then I’m not going to force myself on you, whether Alice is willing or not.”

Esme opened her mouth to speak, but I held up one finger to stop her.

“Please, let me finish. You all know what I want. And I’m sure you know what Edward thinks, too. I think the only fair way to decide is for everyone to have a vote. If you decide you don’t want me, then...I guess I’ll go back to Italy alone. I can’t have them coming here.” My forehead creased as I considered that.

There was the faint rumble of a growl in Edward’s chest. I ignored him.

“Taking into account, then, that I won’t put any of you in danger either way, I want you to vote yes or no on the issue of me becoming a vampire.”

I half-smiled on the last word, and gestured toward Carlisle to begin.

“Just a minute,” Edward interrupted.

I glared at him through narrowed eyes. He raised his eyebrows at me, squeezing my hand.

“I have something to add before we vote.”

I sighed.

“About the danger Bella’s referring to,” he continued. “I don’t think we need to be overly anxious.”

His expression became more animated. He put his free hand on the shining table and leaned forward.

“You see,” he explained, looking around the table while he spoke, “there was more than one reason why I didn’t want to shake Aro’s hand there at the end. There’s something they didn’t think of, and I didn’t want to clue them in.” He grinned.

“Which was?” Alice prodded. I was sure my expression was just as skeptical as hers.

“The Volturi are overconfident, and with good reason. When they decide to find someone, it’s not really a problem. Do you remember Demetri?” He glanced down at me.

I shuddered. He took that as a yes.

“He finds people—that’s his talent, why they keep him.

“Now, the whole time we were with any of them, I was picking their brains for anything that might save us, getting as much information as possible. So I saw how Demetri’s talent works. He’s a tracker—a tracker a thousand times more gifted than James was. His ability is loosely related to what I do, or what Aro does. He catches the...flavor? I don’t know how to describe it...the tenor...of someone’s mind, and then he follows that. It works over immense distances.

“But after Aro’s little experiments, well . . .” Edward shrugged.

“You think he won’t be able to find me,” I said flatly.

He was smug. “I’m sure of it. He relies totally on that other sense. When it doesn’t work with you, they’ll all be blind.”

“And how does that solve anything?”

“Quite obviously, Alice will be able to tell when they’re planning a visit, and I’ll hide you. They’ll be helpless,” he said with fierce enjoyment. “It will be like looking for a piece of straw in a haystack!”

He and Emmett exchanged a glance and a smirk.

This made no sense. “But they can find you,” I reminded him.

“And I can take care of myself.”

Emmett laughed, and reached across the table toward his brother, extending a fist.

“Excellent plan, my brother,” he said with enthusiasm.

Edward stretched out his arm to smack Emmett’s fist with his own.

“No,” Rosalie hissed.

“Absolutely not,” I agreed.

“Nice.” Jasper’s voice was appreciative.

“Idiots,” Alice muttered.

Esme just glared at Edward.

I straightened up in my chair, focusing. This was my meeting.

“All right, then. Edward has offered an alternative for you to consider,” I said coolly. “Let’s vote.”

I looked toward Edward this time; it would be better to get his opinion out of the way. “Do you want me to join your family?”

His eyes were hard and black as flint. “Not that way. You’re staying human.”

I nodded once, keeping my face businesslike, and then moved on.

“Alice?”

“Yes.”

“Jasper?”

“Yes,” he said, voice grave. I was a little surprised—I hadn’t been at all sure of his vote—but I suppressed my reaction and moved on.

“Rosalie?”

She hesitated, biting down on her full, perfect bottom lip. “No.”

I kept my face blank and turned my head slightly to move on, but she held up both her hands, palms forward.

“Let me explain,” she pleaded. “I don’t mean that I have any aversion to you as a sister. It’s just that...this is not the life I would have chosen for myself. I wish there had been someone there to vote no for me.”

I nodded slowly, and then turned to Emmett.

“Hell, yes!” He grinned. “We can find some other way to pick a fight with this Demetri.”

I was still grimacing at that when I looked at Esme.

“Yes, of course, Bella. I already think of you as part of my family.”

“Thank you, Esme,” I murmured as I turned toward Carlisle.

I was suddenly nervous, wishing I had asked for his vote first. I was sure that this was the vote that mattered most, the vote that counted more than any majority.

Carlisle wasn’t looking at me.

“Edward,” he said.

“No,” Edward growled. His jaw was strained tight, his lips curled back from his teeth.

“It’s the only way that makes sense,” Carlisle insisted. “You’ve chosen not to live without her, and that doesn’t leave me a choice.”

Edward dropped my hand, shoving away from the table. He stalked out of the room, snarling under his breath.

“I guess you know my vote.” Carlisle sighed.

I was still staring after Edward. “Thanks,” I mumbled.

An earsplitting crash echoed from the other room.

I flinched, and spoke quickly. “That’s all I needed. Thank you. For wanting to keep me. I feel exactly the same way about all of you, too.” My voice was jagged with emotion by the end.

Esme was at my side in a flash, her cold arms around me.

“Dearest Bella,” she breathed.

I hugged her back. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Rosalie looking down at the table, and I realized that my words could be construed in two ways.

“Well, Alice,” I said when Esme released me. “Where do you want to do this?”

Alice stared at me, her eyes widening with terror.

“No! No! NO!” Edward roared, charging back into the room. He was in my face before I had time to blink, bending over me, his expression twisted in rage. “Are you insane?” he shouted. “Have you utterly lost your mind?”

I cringed away, my hands over my ears.

“Um, Bella,” Alice interjected in an anxious voice. “I don’t think I’m ready for that. I’ll need to prepare....”

“You promised,” I reminded her, glaring under Edward’s arm.

“I know, but...Seriously, Bella! I don’t have any idea how to not kill you.”

“You can do it,” I encouraged. “I trust you.”

Edward snarled in fury.

Alice shook her head quickly, looking panicked.

“Carlisle?” I turned to look at him.

Edward grabbed my face in his hand, forcing me to look at him. His other hand was out, palm toward Carlisle.

Carlisle ignored that. “I’m able to do it,” he answered my question. I wished I could see his expression. “You would be in no danger of me losing control.”

“Sounds good.” I hoped he could understand; it was hard to talk clearly the way Edward held my jaw.

“Hold on,” Edward said between his teeth. “It doesn’t have to be now.”

“There’s no reason for it not to be now,” I said, the words coming out distorted.

“I can think of a few.”

“Of course you can,” I said sourly. “Now let go of me.”

He freed my face, and folded his arms across his chest. “In about two hours, Charlie will be here looking for you. I wouldn’t put it past him to involve the police.”

“All three of them.” But I frowned.

This was always the hardest part. Charlie, Renée. Now Jacob, too. The people I would lose, the people I would hurt. I wished there was some way that I could be the only one to suffer, but I knew that was impossible.

At the same time, I was hurting them more by staying human. Putting Charlie in constant danger through my proximity. Putting Jake in worse danger still by drawing his enemies across the land he felt bound to protect. And Renée—I couldn’t even risk a visit to see my own mother for fear of bringing my deadly problems along with me!

I was a danger magnet; I’d accepted that about myself.

Accepting this, I knew I needed to be able to take care of myself and protect the ones I loved, even if that meant that I couldn’t be with them. I needed to be strong.

“In the interest of remaining inconspicuous,” Edward said, still talking through his gritted teeth, but looking at Carlisle now, “I suggest that we put this conversation off, at the very least until Bella finishes high school, and moves out of Charlie’s house.”

“That’s a reasonable request, Bella,” Carlisle pointed out.

I thought about Charlie’s reaction when he woke up this morning, if—after all that life had put him through in the last week with Harry’s loss, and then I had put him through with my unexplained disappearance—he were to find my bed empty. Charlie deserved better than that. It was just a little more time; graduation wasn’t so far away...

I pursed my lips. “I’ll consider it.”

Edward relaxed. His jaw unclenched.

“I should probably take you home,” he said, more calm now, but clearly in a hurry to get me out of here. “Just in case Charlie wakes up early.”

I looked at Carlisle. “After graduation?”

“You have my word.”

I took a deep breath, smiled, and turned back to Edward. “Okay. You can take me home.”

Edward rushed me out of the house before Carlisle could promise me anything else. He took me out the back, so I didn’t get to see what was broken in the living room.

It was a quiet trip home. I was feeling triumphant, and a little smug. Scared stiff, too, of course, but I tried not to think about that part. It did me no good to worry about the pain—the physical or the emotional—so I wouldn’t. Not until I absolutely had to.

When we got to my house, Edward didn’t pause. He dashed up the wall and through my window in half a second. Then he pulled my arms from around his neck and set me on the bed.

I thought I had a pretty good idea of what he was thinking, but his expression surprised me. Instead of furious, it was calculating. He paced silently back and forth across my dark room while I watched with growing suspicion.

“Whatever you’re planning, it’s not going to work,” I told him.

“Shh. I’m thinking.”

“Ugh,” I groaned, throwing myself back on the bed and pulling the quilt over my head.

There was no sound, but suddenly he was there. He flipped the cover back so he could see me. He was lying next to me. His hand reached up to brush my hair from my cheek.

“If you don’t mind, I’d much rather you didn’t hide your face. I’ve lived without it for as long as I can stand. Now...tell me something.”

“What?” I asked, unwilling.

“If you could have anything in the world, anything at all, what would it be?”

I could feel the skepticism in my eyes. “You.”

He shook his head impatiently. “Something you don’t already have.”

I wasn’t sure where he was trying to lead me, so I thought carefully before I answered. I came up with something that was both true, and also probably impossible.

“I would want...Carlisle not to have to do it. I would want you to change me.”

I watched his reaction warily, expecting more of the fury I’d seen at his house. I was surprised that his expression didn’t change. It was still calculating, thoughtful.

“What would you be willing to trade for that?”

I couldn’t believe my ears. I gawked at his composed face and blurted out the answer before I could think about it.

“Anything.”

He smiled faintly, and then pursed his lips. “Five years?”

My face twisted into an expression somewhere between chagrin and horror.

“You said anything,” he reminded me.

“Yes, but...you’ll use the time to find a way out of it. I have to strike while the iron is hot. Besides, it’s just too dangerous to be human—for me, at least. So, anything but that.”

He frowned. “Three years?”

“No!”

“Isn’t it worth anything to you at all?”

I thought about how much I wanted this. Better to keep a poker face, I decided, and not let him know how very much that was. It would give me more leverage. “Six months?”

He rolled his eyes. “Not good enough.”

“One year, then,” I said. “That’s my limit.”

“At least give me two.”

“No way. Nineteen I’ll do. But I’m not going anywhere near twenty. If you’re staying in your teens forever, then so am I.”

He thought for a minute. “All right. Forget time limits. If you want me to be the one—then you’ll just have to meet one condition.”

“Condition?” My voice went flat. “What condition?”

His eyes were cautious—he spoke slowly. “Marry me first.”

I stared at him, waiting....“Okay. What’s the punch line?”

He sighed. “You’re wounding my ego, Bella. I just proposed to you, and you think it’s a joke.”

“Edward, please be serious.”

“I am one hundred percent serious.” He gazed at me with no hint of humor in his face.

“Oh, c’mon,” I said, an edge of hysteria in my voice. “I’m only eighteen.”

“Well, I’m nearly a hundred and ten. It’s time I settled down.”

I looked away, out the dark window, trying to control the panic before it gave me away.

“Look, marriage isn’t exactly that high on my list of priorities, you know? It was sort of the kiss of death for Renée and Charlie.”

“Interesting choice of words.”

“You know what I mean.”

He inhaled deeply. “Please don’t tell me that you’re afraid of the commitment,” his voice was disbelieving, and I understood what he meant.

“That’s not it exactly,” I hedged. “I’m...afraid of Renée. She has some really intense opinions on getting married before you’re thirty.”

“Because she’d rather you became one of the eternal damned than get married.” He laughed darkly.

“You think you’re joking.”

“Bella, if you compare the level of commitment between a marital union as opposed to bartering your soul in exchange for an eternity as a vampire . . .” He shook his head. “If you’re not brave enough to marry me, then—”

“Well,” I interrupted. “What if I did? What if I told you to take me to Vegas now? Would I be a vampire in three days?”

He smiled, his teeth flashing in the dark. “Sure,” he said, calling my bluff. “I’ll get my car.”

“Dammit.” I muttered. “I’ll give you eighteen months.”

“No deal,” he said, grinning. “I like this condition.”

“Fine. I’ll have Carlisle do it when I graduate.”

“If that’s what you really want.” He shrugged, and his smile became absolutely angelic.

“You’re impossible,” I groaned. “A monster.”

He chuckled. “Is that why you won’t marry me?”

I groaned again.

He leaned toward me; his night-dark eyes melted and smoldered and shattered my concentration. “Please, Bella?” he breathed.

I forgot how to breathe for a moment. When I recovered, I shook my head quickly, trying to clear my suddenly clouded mind.

“Would this have gone better if I’d had time to get a ring?”

“No! No rings!” I very nearly shouted.

“Now you’ve done it,” he whispered.

“Oops.”

“Charlie’s getting up; I’d better leave,” Edward said with resignation.

My heart stopped beating.

He gauged my expression for a second. “Would it be childish of me to hide in your closet, then?”

“No,” I whispered eagerly. “Stay. Please.”

Edward smiled and disappeared.

I seethed in the darkness as I waited for Charlie to check on me. Edward knew exactly what he was doing, and I was willing to bet that all the injured surprise was part of the ploy. Of course, I still had the Carlisle option, but now that I knew there was a chance that Edward would change me himself, I wanted it bad. He was such a cheater.

My door cracked open.

“Morning, Dad.”

“Oh, hey, Bella.” He sounded embarrassed at getting caught. “I didn’t know you were awake.”

“Yeah. I’ve just been waiting for you to wake up so I could take a shower.” I started to get up.

“Hold on,” Charlie said, flipping the light on. I blinked in the sudden brightness, and carefully kept my eyes away from the closet. “Let’s talk for a minute first.”

I couldn’t control my grimace. I’d forgotten to ask Alice for a good excuse.

“You know you’re in trouble.”

“Yeah, I know.”

“I just about went crazy these last three days. I come home from Harry’s funeral, and you’re gone. Jacob could only tell me that you’d run off with Alice Cullen, and that he thought you were in trouble. You didn’t leave me a number, and you didn’t call. I didn’t know where you were or when—or if—you were coming back. Do you have any idea how...how . . .” He couldn’t finish the sentence. He sucked in a sharp breath and moved on. “Can you give me one reason why I shouldn’t ship you off to Jacksonville this second?”

My eyes narrowed. So it was going to be threats, was it? Two could play at that game. I sat up, pulling the quilt around me. “Because I won’t go.”

“Now just one minute, young lady—”

“Look, Dad, I accept complete responsibility for my actions, and you have the right to ground me for as long as you want. I will also do all the chores and laundry and dishes until you think I’ve learned my lesson. And I guess you’re within your rights if you want to kick me out, too—but that won’t make me to go to Florida.”

His face turned bright red. He took a few deep breaths before he answered.

“Would you like to explain where you’ve been?”

Oh, crap. “There was...an emergency.”

He raised his eyebrows in expectation of my brilliant explanation.

I filled my cheeks with air and then blew it out noisily. “I don’t know what to tell you, Dad. It was mostly a misunderstanding. He said, she said. It got out of hand.”

He waited with a distrustful expression.

“See, Alice told Rosalie about me jumping off the cliff....” I was scrambling frantically to make this work, to keep it as close to the truth as possible so that my inability to lie convincingly would not undermine the excuse, but before I could go on, Charlie’s expression reminded me that he didn’t know anything about the cliff.

Major oops. As if I wasn’t already toast.

“I guess I didn’t tell you about that,” I choked out. “It was nothing. Just messing around, swimming with Jake. Anyway, Rosalie told Edward, and he was upset. She sort of accidentally made it sound like I was trying to kill myself or something. He wouldn’t answer his phone, so Alice dragged me to...L.A., to explain in person.” I shrugged, desperately hoping that he would not be so distracted by my slip that he’d miss the brilliant explanation I’d provided.

Charlie’s face was frozen. “Were you trying to kill yourself, Bella?”

“No, of course not. Just having fun with Jake. Cliff diving. The La Push kids do it all the time. Like I said, nothing.”

Charlie’s face heated up—from frozen to hot with fury. “What’s it to Edward Cullen anyway?” he barked. “All this time, he’s just left you dangling without a word—”

I interrupted him. “Another misunderstanding.”

His face flushed again. “So is he back then?”

“I’m not sure what the exact plan is. I think they all are.”

He shook his head, the vein in his forehead pulsing. “I want you to stay away from him, Bella. I don’t trust him. He’s rotten for you. I won’t let him mess you up like that again.”

“Fine,” I said curtly.

Charlie rocked back onto his heels. “Oh.” He scrambled for a second, exhaling loudly in surprise. “I thought you were going to be difficult.”

“I am.” I stared straight into his eyes. “I meant, ‘Fine, I’ll move out.’”

His eyes bulged; his face turned puce. My resolve wavered as I started to worry about his health. He was no younger than Harry....

“Dad, I don’t want to move out,” I said in a softer tone. “I love you. I know you’re worried, but you need to trust me on this. And you’re going to have to ease up on Edward if you want me to stay. Do you want me to live here or not?”

“That’s not fair, Bella. You know I want you to stay.”

“Then be nice to Edward, because he’s going to be where I am.” I said it with confidence. The conviction of my epiphany was still strong.

“Not under my roof,” Charlie stormed.

I sighed a heavy sigh. “Look, I’m not going to give you any more ultimatums tonight—or I guess it’s this morning. Just think about it for a few days, okay? But keep in mind that Edward and I are sort of a package deal.”

“Bella—”

“Think it over,” I insisted. “And while you’re doing that, could you give me some privacy? I really need a shower.”

Charlie’s face was a strange shade of purple, but he left, slamming the door behind him. I heard him stomp furiously down the stairs.

I threw off my quilt, and Edward was already there, sitting in the rocking chair as if he’d been present through the whole conversation.

“Sorry about that,” I whispered.

“It’s not as if I don’t deserve far worse,” he murmured. “Don’t start anything with Charlie over me, please.”

“Don’t worry about it,” I breathed as I gathered up my bathroom things and a set of clean clothes. “I will start exactly as much as is necessary, and no more than that. Or are you trying to tell me I have nowhere to go?” I widened my eyes with false alarm.

“You’d move in with a house full of vampires?”

“That’s probably the safest place for someone like me. Besides . . .” I grinned. “If Charlie kicks me out, then there’s no need for a graduation deadline, is there?”

His jaw tightened. “So eager for eternal damnation,” he muttered.

“You know you don’t really believe that.”

“Oh, don’t I?” he fumed.

“No. You don’t.”

He glowered at me and started to speak, but I cut him off.

“If you really believed that you’d lost your soul, then when I found you in Volterra, you would have realized immediately what was happening, instead of thinking we were both dead together. But you didn’t—you said ‘Amazing. Carlisle was right,’” I reminded him, triumphant. “There’s hope in you, after all.”

For once, Edward was speechless.

“So let’s both just be hopeful, all right?” I suggested. “Not that it matters. If you stay, I don’t need heaven.”

He got up slowly, and came to put his hands on either side of my face as he stared into my eyes. “Forever,” he vowed, still a little staggered.

“That’s all I’m asking for,” I said, and stretched up on my toes so that I could press my lips to his.





EPILOGUE—TREATY



ALMOST EVERYTHING WAS BACK TO NORMAL—THE GOOD, pre-zombie normal—in less time than I would have believed possible. The hospital welcomed Carlisle back with eager arms, not even bothering to conceal their delight that Esme had found life in L.A. so little to her liking. Thanks to the Calculus test I’d missed while abroad, Alice and Edward were in better to shape to graduate than I was at the moment. Suddenly, college was a priority (college was still plan B, on the off chance that Edward’s offer swayed me from the post-graduation Carlisle option). Many deadlines had passed me by, but Edward had a new stack of applications for me to fill out every day. He’d already done the Harvard route, so it didn’t bother him that, thanks to my procrastination, we might both end up at Peninsula Community College next year.

Charlie was not happy with me, or speaking to Edward. But at least Edward was allowed—during my designated visiting hours—inside the house again. I just wasn’t allowed out of it.

School and work were the only exceptions, and the dreary, dull yellow walls of my classrooms had become oddly inviting to me of late. That had a lot to do with the person who sat in the desk beside me.

Edward had resumed his schedule from the beginning of the year, which put him in most of my classes again. My behavior had been such last fall, after the Cullens’ supposed move to L.A., that the seat beside me had never been filled. Even Mike, always eager to take any advantage, had kept a safe distance. With Edward back in place, it was almost as if the last eight months were just a disturbing nightmare.

Almost, but not quite. There was the house arrest situation, for one thing. And for another, before the fall, I hadn’t been best friends with Jacob Black. So, of course, I hadn’t missed him then.

I wasn’t at liberty to go to La Push, and Jacob wasn’t coming to see me. He wouldn’t even answer my phone calls.

I made these calls mostly at night, after Edward had been kicked out—promptly at nine by a grimly gleeful Charlie—and before Edward snuck back through my window when Charlie was asleep. I chose that time to make my fruitless calls because I’d noticed that Edward made a certain face every time I mentioned Jacob’s name. Sort of disapproving and wary...maybe even angry. I guessed that he had some reciprocal prejudice against the werewolves, though he wasn’t as vocal as Jacob had been about the “bloodsuckers.”

So, I didn’t mention Jacob much.

With Edward near me, it was hard to think about unhappy things—even my former best friend, who was probably very unhappy right now, due to me. When I did think of Jake, I always felt guilty for not thinking of him more.

The fairy tale was back on. Prince returned, bad spell broken. I wasn’t sure exactly what to do about the leftover, unresolved character. Where was his happily ever after?

Weeks passed, and Jacob still wouldn’t answer my calls. It started to become a constant worry. Like a dripping faucet in the back of my head that I couldn’t shut off or ignore. Drip, drip, drip. Jacob, Jacob, Jacob.

So, though I didn’t mention Jacob much, sometimes my frustration and anxiety boiled over.

“It’s just plain rude!” I vented one Saturday afternoon when Edward picked me up from work. Being angry about things was easier than feeling guilty. “Downright insulting!”

I’d varied my pattern, in hopes of a different response. I’d called Jake from work this time, only to get an unhelpful Billy. Again.

“Billy said he didn’t want to talk to me,” I fumed, glaring at the rain oozing down the passenger window. “That he was there, and wouldn’t walk three steps to get to the phone! Usually Billy just says he’s out or busy or sleeping or something. I mean, it’s not like I didn’t know he was lying to me, but at least it was a polite way to handle it. I guess Billy hates me now, too. It’s not fair!”

“It’s not you, Bella,” Edward said quietly. “Nobody hates you.”

“Feels that way,” I muttered, folding my arms across my chest. It was no more than a stubborn gesture. There was no hole there now—I could barely remember the empty feeling anymore.

“Jacob knows we’re back, and I’m sure that he’s ascertained that I’m with you,” Edward said. “He won’t come anywhere near me. The enmity is rooted too deeply.”

“That’s stupid. He knows you’re not...like other vampires.”

“There’s still good reason to keep a safe distance.”

I glared blindly out the windshield, seeing only Jacob’s face, set in the bitter mask I hated.

“Bella, we are what we are,” Edward said quietly. “I can control myself, but I doubt he can. He’s very young. It would most likely turn into a fight, and I don’t know if I could stop it before I k—” he broke off, and then quickly continued. “Before I hurt him. You would be unhappy. I don’t want that to happen.”

I remembered what Jacob had said in the kitchen, hearing the words with perfect recall in his husky voice. I’m not sure that I’m even-tempered enough to handle that....You probably wouldn’t like it so much if I killed your friend. But he’d been able to handle it, that time....

“Edward Cullen,” I whispered. “Were you about to say ‘killed him’? Were you?”

He looked away from me, staring into the rain. In front of us, the red light I hadn’t noticed turned green and he started forward again, driving very slowly. Not his usual way of driving.

“I would try...very hard...not to do that,” Edward finally said.

I stared at him with my mouth hanging open, but he continued to look straight ahead. We were paused at the corner stop sign.

Abruptly, I remembered what had happened to Paris when Romeo came back. The stage directions were simple: They fight. Paris falls.

But that was ridiculous. Impossible.

“Well,” I said, and took a deep breath, shaking my head to dispel the words in my head. “Nothing like that is ever going to happen, so there’s no reason to worry about it. And you know Charlie’s staring at the clock right now. You’d better get me home before I get in more trouble for being late.”

I turned my face up toward him, to smile halfheartedly.

Every time I looked at his face, that impossibly perfect face, my heart pounded strong and healthy and very there in my chest. This time, the pounding raced ahead of its usual besotted pace. I recognized the expression on his statue-still face.

“You’re already in more trouble, Bella,” he whispered through unmoving lips.

I slid closer, clutching his arm as I followed his gaze to see what he was seeing. I don’t know what I expected—maybe Victoria standing in the middle of the street, her flaming red hair blowing in the wind, or a line of tall black cloaks...or a pack of angry werewolves. But I didn’t see anything at all.

“What? What is it?”

He took a deep breath. “Charlie...”

“My dad?” I screeched.

He looked down at me then, and his expression was calm enough to ease some of my panic.

“Charlie...is probably not going to kill you, but he’s thinking about it,” he told me. He started to drive forward again, down my street, but he passed the house and parked by the edge of the trees.

“What did I do?” I gasped.

Edward glanced back at Charlie’s house. I followed his gaze, and noticed for the first time what was parked in the driveway next to the cruiser. Shiny, bright red, impossible to miss. My motorcycle, flaunting itself in the driveway.

Edward had said that Charlie was ready to kill me, so he must know that—that it was mine. There was only one person who could be behind this treachery.

“No!” I gasped. “Why? Why would Jacob do this to me?” The sting of betrayal washed through me. I had trusted Jacob implicitly—trusted him with every single secret I had. He was supposed to be my safe harbor—the person I could always rely on. Of course things were strained right now, but I didn’t think any of the underlying foundation had changed. I didn’t think that was changeable!

What had I done to deserve this? Charlie was going to be so mad—and worse than that, he was going to be hurt and worried. Didn’t he have enough to deal with already? I would have never imagined that Jake could be so petty and just plain mean. Tears sprang, smarting, into my eyes, but they were not tears of sadness. I had been betrayed. I was suddenly so angry that my head throbbed like it was going to explode.

“Is he still here?” I hissed.

“Yes. He’s waiting for us there.” Edward told me, nodding toward the slender path that divided the dark fringe of the forest in two.

I jumped out of the car, launching myself toward the trees with my hands already balled into fists for the first punch.

Why did Edward have to be so much faster than me?

He caught me around the waist before I made the path.

“Let me go! I’m going to murder him! Traitor!” I shouted the epithet toward the trees.

“Charlie will hear you,” Edward warned me. “And once he gets you inside, he may brick over the doorway.”

I glanced back at the house instinctively, and it seemed like the glossy red bike was all I could see. I was seeing red. My head throbbed again.

“Just give me one round with Jacob, and then I’ll deal with Charlie.” I struggled futilely to break free.

“Jacob Black wants to see me. That’s why he’s still here.”

That stopped me cold—took the fight right out of me. My hands went limp. They fight; Paris falls.

I was furious, but not that furious.

“Talk?” I asked.

“More or less.”

“How much more?” My voice shook.

Edward smoothed my hair back from my face. “Don’t worry, he’s not here to fight me. He’s acting as...spokesperson for the pack.”

“Oh.”

Edward looked at the house again, then tightened his arm around my waist and pulled me toward the woods. “We should hurry. Charlie’s getting impatient.”

We didn’t have to go far; Jacob waited just a short ways up the path. He lounged against a mossy tree trunk as he waited, his face hard and bitter, exactly the way I knew it would be. He looked at me, and then at Edward. Jacob’s mouth stretched into a humorless sneer, and he shrugged away from the tree. He stood on the balls of his bare feet, leaning slightly forward, with his trembling hands clenched into fists. He looked bigger than the last time I’d seen him. Somehow, impossibly, he was still growing. He would tower over Edward, if they stood next to each other.

But Edward stopped as soon as we saw him, leaving a wide space between us and Jacob. Edward turned his body, shifting me so that I was behind him. I leaned around him to stare at Jacob—to accuse him with my eyes.

I would have thought that seeing his resentful, cynical expression would only make me angrier. Instead, it reminded me of the last time I’d seen him, with tears in his eyes. My fury weakened, faltered, as I stared at Jacob. It had been so long since I’d seen him—I hated that our reunion had to be like this.

“Bella,” Jacob said as a greeting, nodding once toward me without looking away from Edward.

“Why?” I whispered, trying to hide the sound of the lump in my throat. “How could you do this to me, Jacob?”

The sneer vanished, but his face stayed hard and rigid. “It’s for the best.”

“What is that supposed to mean? Do you want Charlie to strangle me? Or did you want him to have a heart attack, like Harry? No matter how mad you are at me, how could you do this to him?”

Jacob winced, and his eyebrows pulled together, but he didn’t answer.

“He didn’t want to hurt anyone—he just wanted to get you grounded, so that you wouldn’t be allowed to spend time with me,” Edward murmured, explaining the thoughts Jacob wouldn’t say.

Jacob’s eyes sparked with hate as he glowered at Edward again.

“Aw, Jake!” I groaned. “I’m already grounded! Why do you think I haven’t been down to La Push to kick your butt for avoiding my phone calls?”

Jacob’s eyes flashed back to me, confused for the first time. “That’s why?” he asked, and then locked his jaw, like he was sorry he’d said anything.

“He thought I wouldn’t let you, not Charlie,” Edward explained again.

“Stop that,” Jacob snapped.

Edward didn’t answer.

Jacob shuddered once, and then gritted his teeth as hard as his fists. “Bella wasn’t exaggerating about your... abilities,” he said through his teeth. “So you must already know why I’m here.”

“Yes,” Edward agreed in a soft voice. “But, before you begin, I need to say something.”

Jacob waited, clenching and unclenching his hands as he tried to control the shivers rolling down his arms.

“Thank you,” Edward said, and his voice throbbed with the depth of his sincerity. “I will never be able to tell you how grateful I am. I will owe you for the rest of my... existence.”

Jacob stared at him blankly, his shudders stilled by surprise. He exchanged a quick glance with me, but my face was just as mystified.

“For keeping Bella alive,” Edward clarified, his voice rough and fervent. “When I...didn’t.”

“Edward—,” I started to say, but he held one hand up, his eyes on Jacob.

Understanding washed over Jacob’s face before the hard mask returned. “I didn’t do it for your benefit.”

“I know. But that doesn’t erase the gratitude I feel. I thought you should know. If there’s ever anything in my power to do for you...”

Jacob raised one black brow.

Edward shook his head. “That’s not in my power.”

“Whose, then?” Jacob growled.

Edward looked down at me. “Hers. I’m a quick learner, Jacob Black, and I don’t make the same mistake twice. I’m here until she orders me away.”

I was immersed momentarily in his golden gaze. It wasn’t hard to understand what I’d missed in the conversation. The only thing that Jacob would want from Edward would be his absence.

“Never,” I whispered, still locked in Edward’s eyes.

Jacob made a gagging sound.

I unwillingly broke free from Edward’s gaze to frown at Jacob. “Was there something else you needed, Jacob? You wanted me in trouble—mission accomplished. Charlie might just send me to military school. But that won’t keep me away from Edward. There’s nothing that can do that. What more do you want?”

Jacob kept his eyes on Edward. “I just needed to remind your bloodsucking friends of a few key points in the treaty they agreed to. The treaty that is the only thing stopping me from ripping his throat out right this minute.”

“We haven’t forgotten,” Edward said at the same time that I demanded, “What key points?”

Jacob still glowered at Edward, but he answered me. “The treaty is quite specific. If any of them bite a human, the truce is over. Bite, not kill,” he emphasized. Finally, he looked at me. His eyes were cold.

It only took me a second to grasp the distinction, and then my face was as cold as his.

“That’s none of your business.”

“The hell it—” was all he managed to choke out.

I didn’t expect my hasty words to bring on such a strong response. Despite the warning he’d come to give, he must not have known. He must have thought the warning was just a precaution. He hadn’t realized—or didn’t want to believe—that I had already made my choice. That I was really intending to become a member of the Cullen family.

My answer sent Jacob into near convulsions. He pressed his fists hard against his temples, closing his eyes tight and curling in on himself as he tried to control the spasms. His face turned sallow green under the russet skin.

“Jake? You okay?” I asked anxiously.

I took a half-step toward him, then Edward caught me and yanked me back behind his own body. “Careful! He’s not under control,” he warned me.

But Jacob was already somewhat himself again; only his arms were shaking now. He scowled at Edward with pure hate. “Ugh. I would never hurt her.”

Neither Edward or I missed the inflection, or the accusation it contained. A low hiss escaped Edward’s lips. Jacob clenched his fists reflexively.

“BELLA!” Charlie’s roar echoed from the direction of the house. “YOU GET IN THIS HOUSE THIS INSTANT!”

All of us froze, listening to the silence that followed.

I was the first to speak; my voice trembled. “Crap.”

Jacob’s furious expression faltered. “I am sorry about that,” he muttered. “I had to do what I could—I had to try....”

“Thanks.” The tremor in my voice ruined the sarcasm. I stared up the path, half-expecting Charlie to come barreling through the wet ferns like an enraged bull. I would be the red flag in that scenario.

“Just one more thing,” Edward said to me, and then he looked at Jacob. “We’ve found no trace of Victoria on our side of the line—have you?”

He knew the answer as soon as Jacob thought it, but Jacob spoke the answer anyway. “The last time was while Bella was...away. We let her think she was slipping through—we were tightening the circle, getting ready to ambush her—”

Ice shot down my spine.

“But then she took off like a bat out of hell. Near as we can tell, she caught your little female’s scent and bailed. She hasn’t come near our lands since.”

Edward nodded. “When she comes back, she’s not your problem anymore. We’ll—”

“She killed on our turf,” Jacob hissed. “She’s ours!”

“No—,” I began to protest both declarations.

“BELLA! I SEE HIS CAR AND I KNOW YOU’RE OUT THERE! IF YOU AREN’T INSIDE THIS HOUSE IN ONE MINUTE...!” Charlie didn’t bother to finish his threat.

“Let’s go,” Edward said.

I looked back at Jacob, torn. Would I see him again?

“Sorry,” he whispered so low that I had to read his lips to understand. “’Bye, Bells.”

“You promised,” I reminded him desperately. “Still friends, right?”

Jacob shook his head slowly, and the lump in my throat nearly strangled me.

“You know how hard I’ve tried to keep that promise, but...I can’t see how to keep trying. Not now . . .” He struggled to keep his hard mask in place, but it wavered, and then disappeared. “Miss you,” he mouthed. One of his hands reached toward me, his fingers outstretched, like he wished they were long enough to cross the distance between us.

“Me, too,” I choked out. My hand reached toward his across the wide space.

Like we were connected, the echo of his pain twisted inside me. His pain, my pain.

“Jake . . .” I took a step toward him. I wanted to wrap my arms around his waist and erase the expression of misery on his face.

Edward pulled me back again, his arms restraining instead of defending.

“It’s okay,” I promised him, looking up to read his face with trust in my eyes. He would understand.

His eyes were unreadable, his face expressionless. Cold. “No, it’s not.”

“Let her go,” Jacob snarled, furious again. “She wants to!” He took two long strides forward. A glint of anticipation flashed in his eyes. His chest seemed to swell as it shuddered.

Edward pushed me behind himself, wheeling to face Jacob.

“No! Edward—!”

“ISABELLA SWAN!”

“Come on! Charlie’s mad!” My voice was panicked, but not because of Charlie now. “Hurry!”

I tugged on him and he relaxed a little. He pulled me back slowly, always keeping his eyes on Jacob as were treated.

Jacob watched us with a dark scowl on his bitter face. The anticipation drained from his eyes, and then, just before the forest came between us, his face suddenly crumpled in pain.

I knew that last glimpse of his face would haunt me until I saw him smile again.

And right there I vowed that I would see him smile, and soon. I would find a way to keep my friend.

Edward kept his arm tight around my waist, holding me close. That was the only thing that held the tears inside my eyes.

I had some serious problems.

My best friend counted me with his enemies.

Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger.

If I didn’t become a vampire soon, the Volturi would kill me.

And now it seemed that if I did, the Quileute werewolves would try to do the job themselves—along with trying to kill my future family. I didn’t think they had any chance really, but would my best friend get himself killed in the attempt?

Very serious problems. So why did they all suddenly seem insignificant when we broke through the last of the trees and I caught sight of the expression on Charlie’s purple face?

Edward squeezed me gently. “I’m here.”

I drew in a deep breath.

That was true. Edward was here, with his arms around me.

I could face anything as long as that was true.

I squared my shoulders and walked forward to meet my fate, with my destiny solidly at my side.





New Moon Discussion Questions




 1. Why is it important that vampires can’t use their powers on Bella? Do you feel that this will hold true if she is bitten?

 2. Discuss the dilemma that Bella faces having strong feelings for two very distinct enemies.

 3. If Bella were to join Edward in the vampire world, what role might Charlie play in her life? Would he be in more danger, or would the Cullens feel a stronger obligation to protect him? And how would his role as “Chief” Swan be affected by her decisions?

 4. Compare and contrast the traits of Jacob’s pack versus the Cullens and even the “Nomads.” How do those differences help and hurt them when they are up against each other?

 5. Edward believes that there is no afterlife for vampires because they have lost their souls. Carlisle believes that his life can have purpose and has faith that there is a reason for it. What do you believe based on what you have read? Is there a different fate for the vampires who hunt humans versus the ones who abstain?

 6. Throughout the novel, Bella often puts herself and those around her in danger. Would you characterize these actions as selfish? Why or why not? What impact is she having on Charlie? On Jacob? On her friends?

 7. Despite his pack’s disapproval, Jacob still finds ways to help Bella. How will this affect his relationship with and status in the pack? Will he ever be able to convince them of the reasons why he needs to be around her?

 8. Is Edward’s decision to leave the right one? And how do you feel about how he handles the situation—especially convincing Bella that he doesn’t love her? What else could he have done?

 9. Bella and Jacob become fast friends, and while Bella needs him emotionally, she also discovers that being with Jacob helps her hear Edward’s voice again. Has Jake been able to help her heal or does he stand in the way, without even knowing? What will become of their relationship? Will being a sworn enemy to her Edward affect it?

 10. Stephenie Meyer has noted that each of the novels in the Twilight Saga pays homage to other literary classics. For New Moon, she has said Romeo & Juliet was the key inspiration. Beyond the main characters and the theme of forbidden love, what other similarities did you notice between the stories? What are the differences, and how are they handled?





Acknowledgments




So much love and thanks to my husband and sons for their continuing understanding and sacrifice in support of my writing. At least I’m not the only one to benefit—I’m sure many local restaurants are grateful that I don’t cook anymore.



Thank you, Mom, for being my best friend and letting me talk your ear off through all the rough spots. Thanks, also, for being so insanely creative and intelligent, and bequeathing a small portion of both into my genetic makeup.



Thanks to all my siblings, Emily, Heidi, Paul, Seth, and Jacob, for letting me borrow your names. I hope I didn’t do anything with them that makes you wish you hadn’t.



A special thanks to my brother Paul for the motorcycle riding lesson—you have a true gift for teaching.



I can’t thank my brother Seth enough for all the hard work and genius he put into the creation of www.stepheniemeyer.com. I’m so grateful for the effort he continues to expend as my Webmaster. Check’s in the mail, kid. This time, I mean it.



Thanks again to my brother Jacob for his ongoing expert advice on all my automotive choices.



A big thank you to my agent, Jodi Reamer, for her continued guidance and assistance in my career. And also for enduring my craziness with a smile when I know she’d like to use some of her ninja moves on me instead.



Love, kisses, and gratitude to my publicist, the beautiful Elizabeth Eulberg, for making my touring experience less a chore and more a pajama party, for aiding and abetting my cyber-stalkery, for convincing those exclusive snobs in the EEC (Elizabeth Eulberg Club) to let me in, and, oh yeah, also for getting me on the New York Times bestseller’s list.



A huge vat of thanks to everyone at Little, Brown and Company for their support and their belief in the potential of my stories.



And, finally, thank you to the talented musicians who inspire me, particularly the band Muse—there are emotions, scenes, and plot threads in this novel that were born from Muse songs and would not exist without their genius. Also Linkin Park, Travis, Elbow, Coldplay, Marjorie Fair, My Chemical Romance, Brand New, The Strokes, Armor for Sleep, The Arcade Fire, and The Fray have all been instrumental in staving off the writer’s block.





When Megan, my publisher, came to me with the idea of doing an interview for the guide, I started to come up with a list of reasons why I couldn’t in my head. Interviews always make me uncomfortable, and really, what question haven’t I answered at this point? But then she went on, presenting her inspiration of having the interview conducted by another author, and I was intrigued in spite of myself. I love hanging out with authors, and I don’t get a chance to do it very often. So I oh-so-casually suggested my “baffy” (Best-Author-Friends-Forever), Shannon Hale. And the upshot was, I got to hang out with Shannon for a whole weekend and it was awesome. We did find time to do our “interview,” which was without a doubt the easiest and most entertaining interview I’ve ever done. This interview took place August 29, 2008, which affects some of the directions that our conversation went, but I was surprised when reading through it again at how relevant it still is.

ON HOW IT ALL BEGAN



SH: So, let’s look at the four different books first. Twilight—it started with a dream.

SM: Right. Should I tell the story—and get it on record?


SH: Do you want to?

SM: I’d like to. This story always sounds really fake to me. And when my publicist told me I needed to tell it—because it was a good story for publicity reasons—I felt like a lot of people were going to say: “You know, that’s ridiculous. She’s making up this silly thing to try and get attention.” But it’s nothing but the cold hard facts of how I got started as a writer.

Usually, I wake up around four o’clock in the morning. I think it’s a baby thing—left over from knowing that somebody needs you—and then I go back to sleep. That’s when I would have the most vivid dreams—those morning hours. And those are the ones you remember when you wake up.

So the dream was me looking down on this scene: It was in this meadow, and there was so much light. The dream was very, very colorful. I don’t know if that always comes through in the writing—that this prism effect was just so brilliant.


I was so intrigued when I woke up. I just sat there and thought: So how does that end?




SH: The sunlight on Edward’s skin?

SM: Yeah. There was this beautiful image, this boy, just glittering with light and talking to this normal girl. And the dream really was about him. She was also listening, as I was, and he was the one telling the story. It was mostly about how much he wanted to kill her—and, yet, how much he loved her.

In the dream I think I’d gotten most of the way through what’s chapter 13 now. The part where he recounts how he felt in each specific previous scene was obviously put in later, because I hadn’t written those earlier scenes yet. But everything else in that scene was mostly what they were actually talking about in the dream. Even the analogy about food was something that I got in my dream.

I was so intrigued when I woke up. I just sat there and thought: So how does that end? Does he kill her? Because it was really close. You know how, in dreams, it’s not just what you hear, but you also kind of feel what’s going on, and you see everything that the person in your head sees. So I knew how close it was. I mean, there was just a thin, thin line between what he was going to choose. And so I just wondered: How would they have made that work? What would be the next step for a couple like this?

I had recently started realizing that my memory was going, and that I could no longer remember whom I had said something to yesterday. My youngest was just passing one, and the next one was two, and I had an almost-five-year-old. So my brains were like oatmeal—there was nothing left. And so I knew I was going to forget this story! That realization was something that really hurt me.

You know, when I was a kid, I always told myself stories, but I didn’t write them down. I didn’t have to—my memory was great then. So I could always go back and revisit the one about this, the one about that, and go over and refine it. But this one was going to get lost if I didn’t do something about it. So after I got the kids’ breakfast done, I only had two hours before swim lessons. And, even though I should have been doing other things, I started writing it out.


It wasn’t the dream so much as that day of writing that made me a writer.




It wasn’t the dream so much as that day of writing that made me a writer. Because the dream was great, and it was a good story. But if I’d had my memory [laughs] it would have stayed just a story in my head. And I would have figured out everything that happened, and told it to myself, but that would have been it.

But writing it down and making it real, and being able to go back and reread the sentences, was just a revelation to me. It was this amazing experience: Wow! This is what it’s like to write down stories. I was just hooked—I didn’t want to quit.

I used to paint—when I was in high school, particularly. I won a few awards—I was okay with the watercolors. My mom still has some hanging up in her house. Slightly embarrassing, but they’re decent. I was not a great painter. It was not something I should have pursued as a career, by any stretch of the imagination. I could see a picture in my head, but I could not put it on the canvas the same way it was in my head. That was always a frustration. When I started writing I immediately had a breakthrough: I can make it real if I write it, and it’s exactly the way I see it in my head. I didn’t know I was able to do that. So that was really the experience that made me a writer, and made me want to continue being one.


SH: So you started out writing out the meadow scene. Where did you go from there?

SM: I continued to the end, chronologically—which I don’t always do anymore.


SH: So you didn’t go back to the beginning… because you wanted to know what was going to happen next.

SM: Yeah. I was just like any reader with a story—you want to find out what happened. The backstory was for later. I wasn’t really that worried about it—I wanted to see where it was going to go.

So I kept writing. The last chapter just kept getting longer and longer—and then I made epilogue after epilogue. There were so many things I wanted to explore—like why this was this way, and why this was that way, and how Bella first met Alice, and what their first impressions were. So I went back and did the beginning, and found it really exciting to be able to flesh it out and give reasons for everything that had happened later.

I had lettered all my chapters instead of numbering them. So I went back and did A, and I think that I had chapter 13 being E. Because I thought, maybe, five or six chapters of material would cover the beginning… and then it was twelve, so I was surprised about that. [Laughs]


SH: You were surprised about how much had really happened beforehand?

SM: Yeah, it just kept going on. I was thinking: Wow, this is taking a long time. And that’s where I finally ended, which was the last sentence in chapter 12. And I knew I had crossed the continent with the railroad, and this was the golden spike that was being driven. It was all linked together. And that was that moment of shock, when I thought: It’s actually long enough to be considered a book-length thing of some kind.


SH: You really didn’t even consider it like a book until then?

SM: No. [Laughs] No, I think if I would have thought of it as a book, I never would have finished it. I think if I would have thought, halfway in, You know, maybe I can make this into a book… maybe I could do something with this, the pressure would have crushed me, and I would have given up. I’m really glad I didn’t think of it that way. I’m glad I protected myself by just keeping it about this personal story for me alone.


SH: And you were thinking of yourself as the reader the whole time.

SM: Yes, yes. Well, I’m kind of shy, and I obviously had to get over that in a lot of ways. But the essential Stephenie, who is still in here, has a really hard time with letting people read things that she writes. [Laughs] And there’s a lot of enjoyment, which I’m sure you’ve experienced, in letting somebody read what you write. But there’s also the fear of it—it’s a really vulnerable position to put yourself in.


SH: I was in a creative-writing class once and the teacher asked us: If we were stranded on a desert island, what two books would we take? And one of the books I chose was a notebook—an empty notebook—so I could write stories. And there was a classmate who said: “If you were on a desert island by yourself, why would you write stories?” And I thought: Why are you in this class? [SM laughs] Because if the only purpose you have for writing is for someone else to read them, then why would you do this? It didn’t make sense to me. But there is something extraordinary about writing for yourself and then sharing that.

SM: I’ve never thought of the desert-island story. But that would be the perfect writing conditions, as far as I’m concerned. That would be great. I wouldn’t want a spiral notebook, though—I’d want a laptop. Typing is so much better. I can’t read my own handwriting half the time.


SH: So you started immediately on the computer, when you started writing this?

SM: Yeah.


It’s kind of funny to know exactly what day you started being a writer!




SH: Now, how long was it from when you wrote down the dream until you finished the first draft?

SM: I wrote down the dream on June second. I had it all marked on my calendar: the first day of my summer diet; the first day of the swim lessons. It’s kind of funny to know exactly what day you started being a writer! And I finished it around my brother’s wedding, which was—he just had his anniversary—I think it was the twenty-ninth of August?


SH: So this was done in less than three months—just an outpouring of words.

SM: Yeah.

SH: Was the story going through your head all day long, even when you weren’t writing?

SM: Even when I was asleep—even when I was awake. I couldn’t hold conversations with people. All my friends just thought that I had dropped them, because I lived in my own world for a whole summer.

But here was this really hot, muggy, nasty summer. And when I looked back on it later, it seemed like I’d spent the whole summer in a cool, green place, because that’s how distant my brain was from what was really going on. I wasn’t there—which is sad. [Laughs]

I was physically there for my kids, and I took care of them. And I had my little ones, one on my leg and one on my lap, most of the time I was writing. Luckily, the TV was behind me [laughs] so they could lean on my shoulder, you know, watch Blue’s Clues while I was typing. But I don’t think you can keep up that kind of concentrated effort for more than a summer. You have to find some balance eventually.


SH: You have to come up for air.

SM: Yeah.


SH: How did you? You’re so busy as a mom. Every moment of the day, with three little kids, is occupied. Suddenly, you’re inserting this huge other effort into it. How did you allow yourself to do that?

SM: A lot of the time it didn’t feel like it was a choice. Once I got started writing, it felt like there was so much that I had been keeping inside for so long.


It was a creative outlet that was the best one I’ve ever found.




SH: Not just this story. But very active storytelling and creating, I’m sure, had been percolating in you for years.

SM: It was a creative outlet that was the best one I’ve ever found. I’ve done other creative things: birthday cakes and really great Halloween costumes, if I do say so myself. I was always looking for ways to creatively express myself. And it was always kind of a frustrating thing—it was never enough. Being a mom, especially when kids are younger—when they get older, it’s a lot easier—you have to be about them every minute. And a lot of who Stephenie is was slipping away.


SH: Yeah.

SM: The writing brought that back in with such force that it was just an obsession I couldn’t… I couldn’t be away from it. And that was, I think, kind of the dam bursting, and that huge surge at first. And then I learned to manage it.


SH: You would have to. But what a tremendous way to start!

SM: It was. It felt really good—it felt really, really good. And I think when you find something that you can do that makes you feel that way, you just grasp on to it.


SH: So you had never written a short story before.

SM: I had not ever considered writing seriously. When I was in high school, I thought of some stories that might be a good book, but I didn’t take it seriously, and I never said: “Gosh, I’m going to do that.” I considered it momentarily—the same way I considered being a professional ballerina.


SH: Right.

SM: Oh, and I was going to be so good [SH laughs] in my Nutcracker. I would have been fantastic—except that, obviously, I have no rhythmic skill, or the build for a ballerina, at all. [SH laughs] So it was like one of those nonsensical things—like wanting to be a dryad.

And then, when I was in college, I actually wrote a couple chapters of something… because I think it’s the law: When you’re an English major, you have to consider being an author as a career. But it was a ridiculous thing. I mean, there’s no way you can make a living as a writer—everybody knows that. And, really, it’s too hard to become an editor—that’s just not a practical solution. If you’re going to support yourself, you have to think realistically. You know, I was going to go to law school. I knew I could do that. I knew that if I worked hard, I’d be kind of guaranteed that I could at least get a decent job somewhere that would pay the bills.

There’s no guarantee like that with writing, or anything in the publishing industry. You’re not guaranteed that you will be able to feed yourself if you go down that path, and so I would have never considered it. I was—I still am—a very practical person.


SH: So you really had to go into it from the side… by fooling yourself that you’re not actually writing a book.

SM: I think there was this subconscious thing going on that was protecting me from thinking of the story in a way that would keep me from being able to finish it.


I always needed that extra fantasy world. I had to have another world I could be in at the same time.




SH: Right. But, of course, you were a reader. You’ve been an avid reader for your whole life.

SM: That was always my favorite thing, until I found writing. My kids and my husband used to tease me, because my hand would kind of naturally form this sort of bookholder [SH laughs], this claw for holding books. Because I had the baby in one arm and the book in the other—with the bottle tucked under my chin and the phone on my shoulder. [Laughs] You know, the Octopus Mom. But I always had a book.

I always needed that extra fantasy world. I had to have another world I could be in at the same time. And so, with writing, I just found a way to have another world, and then to be able to be a lot more a part of it than as a reader.


SH: I think it’s part of multitasking. I wonder if most writers—I know moms have to be this way, but most writers, too—have to have two things going on at once just to stay entertained.

SM: Exactly. [Laughs]


SH: It’s not that I’m unsatisfied, because I love my life. I’m a mom, too, of small kids—and I love my husband—but I also need something else beyond that. I need another story to take me away.

SM: You know, it’s funny. As I’ve become a writer, I started looking at other writers and how they do things, and everybody’s very different. I read Atonement recently, and I was interested in the way Ian McEwan writes about being a writer through the character’s standpoint…. She’s always seeing another story. She’s doing one thing—but, then, in her head, it becomes something else, and it turns into another story.

It’s kind of like what you were saying about writers needing that extra reality to escape to. I think that writers maybe do have just that need for more than one reality. [Laughs]


SH: You know, we’re not really sure if it’s insanity or it’s a superpower.

SM: But it’s an insanity that doesn’t hurt anybody.


SH: Right. It’s kind of friendly, cozy, fuzzy insanity.

ON THE WRITING PROCESS




SH: I think you must write much better first drafts than I do.

SM: I doubt that.


SH: Really? Are they pretty bad?

SM: I think so. I have to go over them again and again, because I don’t always flesh it out enough. I write it through so quickly that I have to go back and add things. I tend to use the same words a lot, and I have to consciously go back and take out things like that. And I don’t always get them. My first drafts are scary.


And I cannot read a page of anything I’ve written without making five changes—that’s my average.




SH: How do you go about rewriting? With Twilight, did you send it off immediately, or did you go back and start revising it?

SM: I probably read it, I don’t know, fifty to a hundred times before I sent it anywhere. And I cannot read a page of anything I’ve written without making five changes—that’s my average. So even now that Twilight is “finished”—quote-unquote—oh, I’d love to revise it. I could do such a better job now. And I have a hard time rereading it. Because if I read it on the computer, I want to go in and change things—and it drives me crazy that I can’t.

SH: Yeah. I try not to read anything that I’ve already published.

SM: If I read it in the book form, I can usually relax and kind of enjoy it. I like to experience the stories again, because I see it like I did the first time I saw it. But sometimes it’s hard not to be like, “Oh, I hate that now. Why did I do it that way?” [Laughs]


SH: That would be writers’ hell: You’re continually faced with a manuscript that you wrote years ago and not allowed to change it.

SM: [Laughs] Well, then, that’s every writer’s reality, right? [Laughs]


SH: I don’t know if you feel this way, but once a book is written and out of my hands and out there, I no longer feel like I wrote it. I don’t feel like I can even claim the story anymore. I feel like now it belongs out there, with the readers.

SM: I feel that way about the hardbound copy on the shelf. There is a disassociation there. If I look at it on a shelf, and it seems very distant and cold and important, I don’t feel like it’s something that belongs to me. When I read it, it does.


SH: I guess I haven’t reread my books. I listen to the audiobooks, actually—one time for each book—and I have enjoyed that. The people who did my audiobooks are a full cast, so it’s like this play, almost.

SM: Oh, that’s so cool.


SH: They say things differently than I would have, but instead of being wigged out by it, I actually like it. Because it’s as though I’m hearing a new story, and I’m hearing it for the first time.

SM: See, I can’t ignore my mistakes as much when I hear it on audio. I have tried to listen to my books on audio, and I cannot do it. Because I hear the awkwardness in a phrase when it’s spoken aloud, and I just think: Oh, gosh! I shouldn’t have phrased it that way. And there’ll be other things where I hear the mistakes a lot louder than when I read through it and kind of skip over them with my eyes.


That was one of my favorite parts—reading it.




SH: Now, by the time you finished Twilight, you thought, This is a book—and then you started to revise. Did you revise just to, like you said, relive the story? Or did you have a purpose?

SM: Well, while I was writing I would revise while I was going. I’d start and go back and read what I’d written up to that point before I started. And some days I’d spend the whole day just making changes and adding things to what I’d written. That was one of my favorite parts—reading it. That surprised me, you know…. But then it’s the book that’s perfect for you, because you wrote it for yourself, and so it’s everything that you want it to be.

And when I put the “golden spike” into it, I looked at it and felt… kind of shocked that I’d finished it. And then I thought maybe there was a reason I’d done all this, that I was supposed to go forward with this. Maybe there was some greater purpose, and I was supposed to do something with it. Because it was such an odd thing for me, to write a book over the summer; it was so odd for me to feel so compelled about it.

The one person who knew what I was doing was my big sister Emily. But my sister’s so: Everything’s wonderful! Everything’s perfect! You shouldn’t change a single word! [SH laughs] She’s so supportive; I knew that it was not a big risk to let her see it. So it was the combination of thinking, I finished this! and Emily saying, “Well, you have to try and publish it. You have to do it.” I don’t know how many times we talked when she’d say, “Stephenie, have you sent anything out yet?”

So then I revised with a purpose. And I revised with a sense of total embarrassment: Oh my gosh. If anyone ever sees this I’ll be so humiliated. I can’t do it. And then Emily would call again, and again I’d feel this sense like: Maybe I’m supposed to. Then I started doing all the research, you know… like looking for an agent. I didn’t know that writers had agents. I thought only athletes and movie stars did that.

So that was intimidating and off-putting: I need an agent? This sounds complicated. Then I had to find out how to write literary queries. And summing up my story in ten sentences was the most painful thing for me.


SH: Horrible.

SM: It does not work well. [Laughs] And it was also pretty painful having to put out this letter that says: “Hi, this is who I am; this is what I’ve written; this is what it’s about. I have absolutely no experience, or any reason why I think that you should actually pick this up, because who am I? Thank you very much, Stephenie Meyer.” [Laughs] That was hard.

And sending them out—I don’t want to remember that often. Because you know how you kind of blank out things that are unpleasant—like childbirth and stuff? It was such a hard thing to do. Back in the neighborhood where I lived at the time, you couldn’t put mail in your mailbox—kids stole it—so you had to drive out and go put it in a real mailbox. And to this day I can’t even go by that corner without reliving the nauseating terror that was in my stomach when I mailed those queries.

SH: Wow.

SM: See, I didn’t take creative-writing classes like you. I didn’t take the classes because I knew someone was going to read what I would write. I didn’t worry about the writing part—it was letting someone else read it. My whole life that was a huge terror of mine: having someone know what goes on inside my head.


With every book, I always see the part that I think people are going to get mad about, or the part that’s going to get mocked.




SH: So how have you? Because, obviously, millions of people now have read what you wrote. Is it still terrifying for you, every time you put a book out?

SM: Yeah… and with good reason. Because the world has changed—and the way books are received is different now. People are very vocal. And I do not have a lot of calluses on my creative soul—every blow feels like the first one. I have not learned how to take that lightly or let it roll off of me. I know it’s something I need to learn before I go mad—but it’s not something that I’ve perfected. And so it’s hard, even when you know it’s coming. You don’t know where it’s coming from—a lot of them are sucker punches.

With every book, I always see the part that I think people are going to get mad about, or the part that’s going to get mocked. With Twilight, I thought: Oh gosh. People are just going to rip me apart for this—if anybody picks it up. Which they’re not going to, because they’re going to read the back and say: A book about vampires? Oh, come on—it’s been so done. So I knew it was coming.

But there were always some things I wasn’t expecting that people wouldn’t like. I mean, with everything you put out, you just have to know: There are going to be people who really like it, and that’s going to feel really good. But there are going to be people who really dislike things that are very personal to me, and I’m just going to have to take it.


SH: But it’s so terrifying. I don’t know how you even have the courage to do it every time. The book of mine that I thought was going to be my simplest, happiest book, just a sweet little fun book that people would enjoy—that was the one that got slammed the hardest. Like you said, it was things I never could have anticipated that people didn’t like.

As I look back on it, I think if I had a chance, I would take those parts out, or change those things that people hated. But I didn’t know at the time. And so now, as I’m writing another book—I know there are things that people are going to hate. But I don’t know what they are. [SM laughs] If I only knew what they were, I would be sorely tempted to change them to try and please everyone! I do the very best I can, but you can never anticipate what it is that people are going to react to.

SM: See, I have a very different reaction to that, because I can’t change it—it is the way it is. I mean, there are things I can do in editing—and I can polish the writing. I know I can always do better with that. And I know that, even in the final form, if I could have another three months to work on it, I would never stop polishing, because I can always make every word more important.

But I just can’t change what happens, because that’s the way it is. That’s the story: Who the people are dictates what happens to them. I mean, there are outside forces that can come in, but how the characters respond to them eventually determines where they’re going to be. Once you know who they are, there’s no way to change what their future is—it just is what it is.

And so my reaction, when the criticism is really bad and really hard, is: I wish I would have kept this in my computer. I should have just held on to this work and have it be mine alone. Because sometimes I wonder: Is it worth it to share it? But then you feel like you’re not doing your characters a service with that—they deserve to live more fully, in someone else’s mind.

Yes, I know I sound crazy! [Laughs]


SH: No. I totally, totally understand that. I remember hearing writers talk about how their characters are almost alive, and almost have a will of their own. And I thought they were kinda full of crap [SM laughs] but there is something to it. I think that it’s a balance, though. There’s the idea of these characters that are alive in my mind, and then there’s me, the author. And I have some power to control the story, and to try and make it a strong story—but, then, the characters also have some power to say no.

SM: Yeah.


You can’t change who they are to make the story go easier.




SH: For me, writing is finding a balance between that sort of transcendental story and my own power of writing—not letting myself overwrite them too much, and not letting them overrun me.

SM: Yeah. See, I find that difficult—because, to me, you create a character, and you define them, and you make them who they are. And you get them into a shape where they are final. Their story isn’t, but they are who they are—and they do feel very real. You can’t change who they are to make the story go easier.

So sometimes things happen in the story because my character, being who he is, can’t do anything different. I’ve written him so tightly into who he is that I cannot change his course of action now, without feeling like: Well, that’s not in character—that’s not what he would do. There’s only one course now. And sometimes it’s hard, when the course goes a way that’s difficult to write.
