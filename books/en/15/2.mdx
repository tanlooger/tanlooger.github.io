For my dad, Stephen Morgan—



No one has ever been given more loving and unconditional support than I have been given by you.I love you, too.





These violent delights have violent ends

And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,

Which, as they kiss, consume.

Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene VI
