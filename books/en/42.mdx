“Breathlessly exciting.”

—THE WASHINGTON POST


Here is the runaway bestseller that launched Tom Clancy’s phenomenal career. A military thriller so gripping in its action and so convincing in its accuracy that the author was rumored to have been debriefed by the White House.



THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER


Somewhere under the Atlantic, a Soviet sub commander has just made a fateful decision. The Red October is heading west. The Americans want her.

The Russians want her back. And the most incredible chase in history is on…





“Gripping narrative…Navy buffs and thriller adepts have been mesmerized.”

—Time


“Remarkable…intricate and nerve tingling.”

—Clive Cussler
