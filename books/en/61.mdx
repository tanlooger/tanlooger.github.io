FOREWORD




Maps of Time unites natural history and human history in a single, grand, and intelligible narrative. This is a great achievement, analogous to the way in which Isaac Newton in the seventeenth century united the heavens and the earth under uniform laws of motion; it is even more closely comparable to Darwin’s nineteenth-century achievement of uniting the human species and other forms of life within a single evolutionary process.

The natural history that David Christian deals with in the first chapters of this book is itself radically extended and transformed from the natural history of earlier ages. It starts with the big bang some 13 billion years ago, when, according to twentieth-century cosmologists, the universe we inhabit began to expand and transform itself. Processes thereby inaugurated are still in course, as time and space (perhaps) began, allowing matter and energy to separate from one another and distribute themselves throughout space in different densities and with different rates of energy flows in response to a variety of strong and weak forces. Matter, gathering into local clots under the influence of gravity, became radiant stars, clustered into galaxies. New complexities, new flows of energy arose around such structures. Then, some 4.6 billion years ago, around one star, our sun, planet Earth formed and soon became the seat of still more complicated processes, including life in all its forms. Humankind added yet another level of behavior a mere 250,000 years ago, when our use of language and other symbols began to introduce a new capacity for what Christian calls “collective learning.” This in turn made human societies uniquely capable of concerting common effort so as to alter and sporadically expand widely varying niches in the ecosystem around each of them and, by now, surround us all in the single, global system.

The human history that Christian thus fits into the recently elaborated natural history of the universe is also an intellectual creation of the twentieth century. For while the efforts of physicists, cosmologists, geologists, and biologists were making the natural sciences historical, anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, and sociologists were busy enlarging knowledge about the human career on earth. They extended it back in time and expanded it pretty well across the face of the earth to embrace foragers, early farmers, and other peoples who left no written records and had therefore been excluded from document-based “scientific” history in the nineteenth century.

Most historians, of course, paid no attention to “prehistory,” or to the lives of illiterate peoples, busy as they were with their own professional debates. Across the twentieth century, those debates, and the study of abundant Eurasian and a few African and Amerindian texts, added substantially to the sum of historical information and to the scope of our ideas about the accomplishments of the urbanized, literate, and civilized peoples of the earth. A few world historians, like myself, tried to weave those researches together into a more adequate portrait of humanity’s career as a whole; and some also explored the ecological impact of human activity I even wrote a programmatic essay, “History and the Scientific Worldview” (History and Theory 37, no. 1 [1998]: 1–13), describing what had happened to the natural sciences and challenging historians to generalize boldly enough to connect their discipline with the historicization of the natural sciences that had taken place behind our backs. Several scholars are, in fact, working toward that end, but only when I began to correspond with David Christian did I discover a historian who was already writing such a work.

The truly astounding dimension of Christian’s accomplishment is that he finds similar patterns of transformation at every level. Here, for example, is what he says about stars and cities:



In the early universe, gravity took hold of atoms and sculpted them into stars and galaxies. In the era described in this chapter, we will see how, by a sort of social gravity, cities and states were sculpted from scattered communities of farmers. As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a new level of complexity. Like stars, cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field. (p. 245)





Or weigh the words with which he closes this extraordinary book:



Being complex creatures ourselves, we know from personal experience how hard it is to climb the down escalator, to work against the universal slide into disorder, so we are inevitably fascinated by other entities that appear to do the same thing. Thus this theme—the achievement of order despite, or perhaps with the aid of, the second law of thermodynamics—is woven through all parts of the story told here. The endless waltz of chaos and complexity provides one of this book’s unifying ideas, (p. 511)





I venture to say that Christian’s discovery of order amid “the endless waltz of chaos and complexity” is not just one among other unifying themes, but the supreme achievement of this work.

Here, then, is a historical and intellectual masterpiece: clear, coherent, erudite, elegant, venturesome, and concise. It offers his readers a magnificent synthesis of what scholars and scientists have learned about the world around us in the past hundred years, showing how strangely, yet profoundly, human societies remain a part of nature, properly at home in the universe despite our extraordinary powers, unique self-consciousness, and inexhaustible capacity for collective learning.

Perhaps I should conclude this introduction with a few words about who David Christian is. First of all, he has an international identity, being the son of an English father and an American mother who met and married in Izmir, Turkey. His mother, however, returned to Brooklyn, New York, for the birth of her son in 1946, while her husband, after discharge from his wartime duties in the British army, joined the colonial service and became a district officer in Nigeria. His wife quickly joined him there, so David’s childhood was spend up-country in Nigeria until, at age 7, he went away to boarding school in England. Then, in due course, he went up to Oxford, getting a B.A. in modern history in 1968. (At Oxford this means mastering isolated segments from the history of England since Roman times along with a scattering of other fields in European history and even a few decades sliced from the American past: the very antithesis of “big history.”) For the next two years, he took a job as a tutor at the University of Western Ontario in Canada, and earned an M.A. degree there. By then he had decided to specialize in Russian history and returned to Oxford, where a thesis on administrative reforms under Tsar Alexander I won him a D. Phil. in 1974. Like his father, he married an American wife; they have two children.

Between 1975 and 2000 he taught Russian history at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia, along with other courses in Russian literature and European history. Influenced by the Annales school in France, his interests shifted to everyday aspects of Russian lives. Two books resulted, both dealing with what Russians put into their mouths: Bread and Salt: A Social and Economic History of Food and Drink in Russia (1985, coauthored with R. E. E Smith) and Living Water: Vodka and Russian Society on the Eve of Emancipation (1990). These books soon attracted invitations to write more general works: first Power and Privilege: Russia and the Soviet Union in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (1986), then A History of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia, volume 1, Inner Eurasia from Prehistory to the Mongol Empire (1998).

The broad geographical and temporal sweep of the last of these books already reflected a teaching venture he launched in 1989 when, in the course of a discussion about what sort of introduction to history the department at Macquarie ought to provide for its students, David Christian blurted out something like “Why not start at the beginning?” and promptly found himself invited to show his colleagues what that might mean. Unlike every other historian who ever tried to teach human history on a world scale, Christian decided to begin with the universe itself; and with help from colleagues in other departments of the university, who lectured on their own scientific specialties, he staggered through the first year of what he jestingly chose to call “big history.”

From the start, big history attracted a large and what soon became an enthusiastic student following. But his most responsive professional audience first arose in the Netherlands and in the United States, where news of what David Christian was doing persuaded a handful of venturesome teachers to launch parallel courses. The World History Association as well as the American Historical Association took note by devoting a session to big history at their annual meetings in 1998. Three years later David Christian decided to accept an invitation to come to San Diego State University and bring big history with him.

Other professional interests remain active. A second volume of his History of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia is in the works; so is an account of the Russian campaign to ban alcohol that peaked in the early 1920s. In his spare time David Christian has also written several important articles on scale in the study of history and a variety of other subjects. He is, in short, a historian of altogether unusual energy, daring, and accomplishment.

You, who are about to peruse this book, have a great experience before you. Read on, wonder, and admire.

A project like this turns a person into a magpie. You collect ideas and information voraciously; and after a bit you can start to forget each particular act of intellectual larceny. Fortunately for me, most scholars are (despite popular reputation) astonishingly generous with their time and ideas. I have benefited from this generosity particularly at the two institutions at which I have spent most of my career: Macquarie University in Sydney and San Diego State University in California. I will try to acknowledge as many debts as I can, but there are many more that I cannot acknowledge because I cannot remember them. Suggestions, approaches, book references have been tucked away in my mind so securely that I cannot remember where I got them; sometimes I may even be tempted to think of them as my own discoveries. Where such memory lapses have happened (and I am sure they often have), I can only apologize and express a generalized thanks to those friends and colleagues who have had the patience to discuss with me the large-scale historical problems that have fascinated me now for more than a decade.

I would particularly like to thank Chardi, who is a professional storyteller and a Jungian. She persuaded me that I was really teaching a creation myth. I also want to thank Terry (Edmund) Burke, who teaches a course on “big history” at Santa Cruz, in California. He persuaded me that the time had come to try to write a textbook on big history, in the hope that it might encourage others to teach similar courses. He has also given me invaluable (if sometimes painful) criticism on earlier drafts of this manuscript. And he has been a constant source of encouragement.

I am extremely grateful to all those who lectured or tutored in the big history course I taught at Macquarie University between 1989 and 1999. I list them in alphabetical order: David Allen, Michael Archer, Ian Bedford, Craig Benjamin, Jerry Bentley, David Briscoe, David Cahill, Geoff Cowling, Bill Edmonds, Brian Fegan, Dick Flood, Leighton Frappell, Annette Hamilton, Mervyn Hartwig, Ann Henderson-Sellers, Edwin Judge, Max Kelly, Bernard Knapp, John Koenig, Jim Kohen, Sam Lieu, David Malin, John Merson, Rod Miller, Nick Modjeska, Marc Norman, Bob Norton, Ron Paton, David Phillips, Chris Powell, Caroline Ralston, George Raudzens, Stephen Shortus, Alan Thorne, Terry Widders, and Michael Williams. I would also like to thank Macquarie University for the period of academic leave during which the first draft of this book was written.

Several people have been particularly supportive of the idea of big history, and some have taught other courses on the big history scale. John Mears started teaching such a class at about the same time as I did, and has always been an enthusiastic supporter of the idea. Tom Griffiths and colleagues taught a big history course at Monash University in the early 1990s. Johan Goudsblom began teaching one at the University of Amsterdam, and has been an enthusiastic supporter of the project. His colleague, Fred Spier, wrote the first book on big history, an ambitious and brilliantly argued case for the construction of a “grand unified theory” embracing the social sciences as well as the natural sciences (The Structure of Big History: From the Big Bang until Today). Others who have expressed interest and support for such an approach or have taught similar courses include George Brooks, Edmund Burke III, Marc Cioc, Ann Curthoys, Graeme Davidson, Ross Dunn, Arturo Giraldez, Bill Leadbetter, and Heidi Roupp. At the American Historical Association conference in Seattle in January 1998, Arnold Schrier chaired a panel on big history that included papers from myself, John Mears, and Fred Spier, as well as a perceptive and supportive commentary from Patricia O’Neal. Gale Stokes invited me to discuss big history on a panel on “the play of scales” at the American Historical Association conference in San Francisco in January 2002.

A number of other people have read or commented on drafts of parts of this book. In addition to some of those already listed, they include Elizabeth Cobbs Hoffman, Ross Dunn, Patricia Fara, Ernie Grieshaber, Chris Lloyd, Winton Higgins, Peter Menzies, and Louis Schwartzkopf. Professor I. D. Koval’chenko invited me to give a talk on big history at Moscow University, and Valerii Nikolayev invited me to talk at the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, both in 1990. Stephen Mennell asked me to speak about big history at a conference he convened almost ten years ago, and Eric Jones gave me invaluable feedback on that paper. Ken Pomeranz sent me a draft chapter from his then-unpublished book on the “great divergence” and invited me to speak on big history at the University of California, Irvine. Over the years, I have given talks on big history at many other universities, including Macquarie and Monash Universities and the Universities of Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, Wollongong, and Western Australia in Australia; at the University of California, Santa Cruz; at Minnesota State University, Mankato; and at Indiana University, Bloomington, in the United States; at Victoria University in Canada; and at Newcastle and Manchester Universities in the United Kingdom. I worked with John Anderson for almost two years on a theoretical article on power- and wealth-maximizing societies. The article never saw the light of day, but collaborating with John gave me many new insights into the transition to modernity.

Since sending out copies of an earlier draft of this text in September 1999, I have received generous criticisms and comments from several other colleagues. They include (in alphabetical order): Alfred Crosby, Arturo Giráldez, Johan Goudsblom, Marnie Hughes-Warrington, William H. McNeill, John Mears, Fred Spier, and Mark Welter. I am also grateful to at least two anonymous reviewers recruited by the University of California Press. Marnie Hughes-Warrington taught with me in my big history course in 2000 and offered many invaluable suggestions. As a historiographer, she was able to alert me to historiographical implications of the subject that I had missed. William McNeill engaged in a long and generous correspondence with me about an earlier draft of this manuscript. His comments were both encouraging and critical, and they have shaped my own ideas substantially. In particular, he persuaded me to take more seriously the role of networks of exchange in world history.

I would also like to thank the many students whom I have taught at Macquarie in HIST112: An Introduction to World History, and at San Diego State University in HIST411: World History for Teachers and HIST100: World History. Their questions kept me focused on what is important. I am particularly thankful to those students who provided me with information or told me about new discoveries they found in books I didn’t know about or on the Internet, and also to those who, by enjoying the course, made me feel it was worthwhile.

I feel I owe particular thanks to the staff of the University of California Press, including Lynne Withey, Suzanne Knott, and many others. Alice Falk copyedited my manuscript with terrifying thoroughness. Their professionalism, courtesy, and good humor greatly eased the complex and sometimes difficult passage from manuscript to book.

In a book on this scale, it goes without saying that no one I have thanked for their help or support is in any way to blame for errors in the text; nor can it be assumed that any of them necessarily agree with the book’s argument. I remained stubborn enough to resist many of the kindly criticisms that have been offered of its earlier drafts, so I must remain wholly responsible for all remaining errors of fact, interpretation, or balance.

I hope Chardi, Joshua, and Emily will think of this as a gift from me, a small return for the gift that they have been to me over many years.

PREFACE TO THE 2011 EDITION




Maps of Time was published in 2004. To my delight it was treated very kindly. I was surprised, because I expected historians in particular to reject the very idea of a sort of “universal history,” a history of all of time. Skepticism there certainly was about the idea of big history, and plenty of quibbles about particular parts of the text, but most reviewers seemed convinced that the project was not absurd and could indeed yield interesting insights. Some were more enthusiastic, seeing big history as an exciting new area of historical scholarship. World historians were particularly generous in their support, a generosity reflected in the awarding to Maps of Time of the WHA prize for the best book in world history published in 2004. Maps of Time has also gone international, with translations into Spanish and Mandarin, which means it is now available in the world’s three most widely spoken languages. A Korean translation is in preparation.

Since 2004, interest in big history has grown, and now big history can realistically be thought of as a rapidly emerging field of teaching and scholarship. Some idea of this boom can be gleaned from the bibliography compiled by Barry Rodrigue, Fred Spier, and Daniel Stasko and available from the International Big History Association web site at www.ibhanet.org. Recent works include a major survey of big history by Cynthia Brown, and Fred Spier’s rich theorization of big history, Big History and the Future of Humanity.1 In 2007 I recorded a set of lectures on big history published by the Teaching Company, and the college-level text in big history that I have written with Cynthia Brown and Craig Benjamin will be available in 2012.

I remain happy with the basic arguments of Maps of Time, though my own ideas have continued to evolve since 2004. Definitions of what big history is are acquiring a sharper focus. For example, it is clear that what distinguishes big history most decisively from world history is its interdisciplinary nature and its search for an underlying unity beneath the various accounts of the past told in different historically oriented disciplines. Big history studies the past across physics, astronomy, geology, biology, and human history. As it does so, it seeks common themes, paradigms, and methods, as well as a clearer understanding of differences in the subject matter, the methods, and the paradigms of different fields of historical scholarship.

Some ideas that were present but undeveloped in Maps of Time have since acquired sharper definition, both in my own mind and in the work of colleagues in the field. For example:



• In Big History and the Future of Humanity, Fred Spier has built on an earlier work of his and on the work of Eric Chaisson to produce what is currently by far the most sophisticated attempt to construct a thematic scaffolding for big history. He carefully links the idea of increasing complexity with the associated themes of energy flows and the idea of goldilocks conditions—the notion that complexity can increase only under very special conditions and within quite exacting “boundary conditions.” Here are broad theoretical ideas that can help give greater depth and coherence to the story told within big history.



• I have explored the idea that the chronometric revolution—that is to say, the evolution of new ways of providing absolute dates for past events—was a crucial step toward big history2 Before the middle of the twentieth century (as H. G. Wells admitted ruefully in the 1920s), it was impossible to write a rigorous, scientific history of the entire universe, because absolute dates still had to be based on written texts, so they could reach back no further than a few thousand years. That may help explain the powerful convention that “history” really meant no more than the history of literate human societies. Only with the appearance of carbon 14 dating and related dating techniques in the 1950s did big history become possible.



• There has also been considerable discussion of the historiography of big history and of how the field fits into the evolution of historical thinking as a whole. My own attempt to think this through can be found in “The Return of Universal History”3 Craig Benjamin has written a fine account of the evolution of big history in the introduction to a series of articles on the subject.4



One of the most exciting features of big history is its inherently global nature. Within big history, human beings are encountered first as a single species, and only very late in such a survey do national or civilizational perspectives acquire salience. As a result, big history holds out the prospect of creating a genuinely global account of the past of humanity, one not bound to national perspectives, an account that, like good science, should work as well in Seoul or Delhi or Buenos Aires as in London or New York.

New concepts are also emerging that capture well the distinctive perspective of big history. One of the most powerful is the idea proposed by the Nobel Prize–winning climatologist Paul Crutzen that today we have entered a new geological era, the “Anthropocene,” the first era in the history of the planet in which a single species, our own, has become the dominant force in shaping the biosphere.5 That vision of the contemporary world fits very well with big history’s inherently ecological account of human history.

Since 2004 there have been major organizational developments in the field. The number of college-level courses in big history has increased rapidly, and there may be at least fifty such courses being taught throughout the world today. With the encouragement and support of Cynthia Brown, Dominican University of California in San Rafael (near San Francisco) has become the first university to introduce big history as a foundation course for first-year students. In April 2011, a scholarly organization was founded to develop big history as a research and teaching field: the International Big History Association. Barry Rodrigue and Daniel Stasko have traced the rapid expansion of teaching and scholarship in big history in essays available on the IBHA web site, and in August 2012 the IBHA will host the first major international big history conference in Michigan.6 In March 2011 the “Big History Project” was launched to build a free online high school syllabus in big history.7 There are many indirect signs that big history is finding its way to a wide audience. In Amsterdam, big history has been the subject of public debate for well over a decade, in response both to the University of Amsterdam’s introduction of a big history course and to the granting to William McNeill of an Erasmus Prize in 1996. Fred Spier and Barry Rodrigue have tracked teachers and scholars interested in the field and have shown that a remarkable number of people are undertaking courses or research projects closely aligned with the goals of big history.

But despite these signs of growth, the field still has a long way to travel. The conventional borders between disciplines remain well policed and are sometimes defended with surprising aggression. This may help explain why, though there now exists a substantial body of big history scholarship, and big history promises to open up exciting new research agendas (including the meaning of complexity and energy flows, and the role of information across many disciplines), there are still no large interdisciplinary research projects in the field. At the time of writing, there is only one formal university appointment in big history (Fred Spier at the University of Amsterdam), and there exists only a tiny cohort of graduate students engaged in big history projects (three of them currently at Macquarie University in Sydney). A start has been made on teaching big history in high schools. But it remains to be seen how many schools and education departments will decide that teaching big history can help students understand the underlying unity and coherence of modern knowledge and appreciate the powerful intellectual synergies to be found in genuinely interdisciplinary thinking and teaching.

I am confident that big history will flourish, partly because it evidently has the ability, like a gestalt switch, to help students and scholars see familiar things in new ways. The other reason for my confidence is the energy, intelligence, generosity, and adventurousness of the small group of scholars who have helped build the field over the past two decades. Building big history has truly been an exercise in collective learning.

I would like to end by thanking William McNeill for lending his great authority to a field of historical scholarship that, even a decade ago, seemed extremely marginal. His support of big history has done a huge amount to persuade historians that the project is interesting, illuminating, and important, and that they may have much to gain by expanding their vision of what “history” means.

INTRODUCTION


A MODERN CREATION MYTH?





“BIG HISTORY”: LOOKING AT THE PAST ON ALL TIMESCALES




[T]he way to study history is to view it as a long duration, as what I have called the longue durée. It is not the only way, but it is one which by itself can pose all the great problems of social structures, past and present. It is the only language binding history to the present, creating one indivisible whole.



Universal history comprehends the past life of mankind, not in its particular relations and trends, but in its fullness and totality.





A Moment’s Halt—a momentary taste

Of BEING from the Well amid the Waste—

And Lo!—the phantom Caravan has reached

The NOTHING it set out from—Oh, make haste!





Like merchants in a huge desert caravan, we need to know where we are going, where we have come from, and in whose company we are traveling. Modern science tells us that the caravan is vast and varied, and our fellow travelers include numerous exotic creatures, from quarks to galaxies. We also know a lot about where the journey started and where it is headed. In these ways, modern science can help us answer some of the deepest questions we can ask concerning our own existence, and that of the universe through which we travel. It can help us draw the line we all must draw between the personal and the universal.

“Who am I? Where do I belong? What is the totality of which I am a part?” In some form, all human communities have asked these questions. And in most human societies, educational systems, formal and informal, have tried to answer them. Often, the answers have been embedded in cycles of creation myths. By offering memorable and authoritative accounts of how everything began—from our own communities, to the animals, plants, and landscapes around us, to the earth, the Moon and skies, and even the universe itself—creation myths provide universal coordinates within which people can imagine their own existence and find a role in the larger scheme of things. Creation myths are powerful because they speak to our deep spiritual, psychic, and social need for a sense of place and a sense of belonging. Because they provide so fundamental a sense of orientation, they are often integrated into religious thinking at the deepest levels, as the Genesis story is within the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. It is one of the many odd features of modern society that despite having access to more hard information than any earlier society, those in modern educational systems do not normally teach such a story. Instead, from schools to universities to research institutes, we teach about origins in disconnected fragments. We seem incapable of offering a unified account of how things came to be the way they are.

I have written this book in the belief that such intellectual modesty is unnecessary and harmful. It is unnecessary because the elements of a modern creation myth are all around us. It is harmful because it contributes to the subtle but pervasive quality of disorientation in modern life that the pioneering French sociologist Émile Durkheim referred to as “anomie”: the sense of not fitting in, which is an inescapable condition of those who have no conception of what it is they are supposed to fit into.

Maps of Time attempts to assemble a coherent and accessible account of origins, a modern creation myth. It began as a series of lectures in an experimental history course taught at Macquarie University in Sydney. The idea of that course was to see if it was possible, even in the modern world, to tell a coherent story about the past on many different scales, beginning, literally, with the origins of the universe and ending in the present day. Each scale, I hoped, would add something new to the total picture and make it easier to understand all the other scales. Given the conventions of the modern history profession, this was an extremely presumptuous idea. But it turned out to be surprisingly doable, and even more interesting than I had originally supposed. Part of the task of my introduction will be to justify this distinctive way of thinking and teaching about the past.

I began teaching “big history” in 1989; two years later I published an essay in which I attempted a formal defense of this approach.1 Though aware of the oddity of the project, those of us trying to teach big history were soon convinced that these large questions made for interesting classes and encouraged fruitful thinking about the nature of history. Teaching this large story persuaded us that beneath the awesome diversity and complexity of modern knowledge, there is an underlying unity and coherence, ensuring that different timescales really do have something to say to each other. Taken together, these stories have all the power and richness of a traditional cycle of creation myths. They constitute what indigenous Australians might call a modern “Dreaming”—a coherent account of how we were created and how we fit into the scheme of things.

We found something else that most premodern societies have known: there is an astonishing power to any story that attempts to grasp reality whole. This power is quite independent of the success or failure of any particular attempt; the project itself is powerful, and fulfills deep needs. Trying to look at the whole of the past is, it seems to me, like using a map of the world. No geographer would try to teach exclusively from street maps. Yet most historians teach about the past of particular nations, or even of agrarian civilizations, without ever asking what the whole of the past looks like. So what is the temporal equivalent of the world map? Is there a map of time that embraces the past at all scales?

This is a good moment to raise such questions, because there is a growing sense, across many scholarly disciplines, that we need to move beyond the fragmented account of reality that has dominated scholarship (and served it well) for a century. Scientists have moved fastest in this direction. The success of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time (1988) also shows the great popular interest in trying to understand reality whole. In Hawking’s own field, cosmology, the idea of a “grand unified theory” once seemed ridiculously overambitious. Now it is taken for granted. Biology and geology have also moved toward more unified accounts of their subject matter, with the consolidation, since the 1960s, of modern paradigms of evolution and plate tectonics.2

Scholars at the Santa Fe Institute in the United States have been exploring such interconnections for many years. An associate of the institute, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Murray Gell-Mann, has eloquently stated the arguments for a more unified account of reality as they appear to a physicist.



We live in an age of increasing specialization, and for good reason. Humanity keeps learning more about each field of study; and as every specialty grows, it tends to split into subspecialties. That process happens over and over again, and it is necessary and desirable. However, there is also a growing need for specialization to be supplemented by integration. The reason is that no complex, nonlinear system can be adequately described by dividing it up into subsystems or into various aspects, defined beforehand. If those subsystems or those aspects, all in strong interaction with one another, are studied separately, even with great care, the results, when put together, do not give a useful picture of the whole. In that sense, there is profound truth in the old adage, ‘The whole is more than the sum of its parts.”





People must therefore get away from the idea that serious work is restricted to beating to death a well-defined problem in a narrow discipline, while broadly integrative thinking is relegated to cocktail parties. In academic life, in bureaucracies, and elsewhere, the task of integration is insufficiently respected.



At the Santa Fe Institute, he adds, “People are found who have the courage to take a crude look at the whole in addition to studying the behavior of parts of a system in the traditional way.”3

Should historians look for a similar unifying structure, perhaps a “grand unified story” that can summarize the best modern knowledge about origins from a historian’s perspective? The rise of the new subdiscipline of world history is a sign that many historians also feel the need for a more coherent vision of their subject. Big history is a response to this need. In the late 1980s, John Mears, at Southern Methodist University (in Dallas, Texas), began teaching a history course on the largest possible scales at about the same time as I did. And since then, a number of other universities have offered similar courses—in Melbourne, Canberra, and Perth in Australia; in Amsterdam; and also in Santa Cruz in the United States. Fred Spier, from the University of Amsterdam, has gone one step further and written the first book on big history. In it, he offers an ambitious defense of the project of constructing a unified account of the past at all scales.4

Meanwhile, there is a growing sense among scholars in many fields that we may be close to a grand unification of knowledge. The biologist E. O. Wilson has argued that we need to start exploring the links between different domains of knowledge, from cosmology to ethics.5 The world historian William McNeill has written:



Human beings, it appears, do indeed belong in the universe and share its unstable, evolving character… . [W]hat happens among human beings and what happens among the stars looks to be part of a grand, evolving story featuring spontaneous emergence of complexity that generates new sorts of behavior at every level of organization from the minutest quarks and leptons to the galaxies, from long carbon chains to living organisms and the biosphere, and from the biosphere to the symbolic universes of meaning within which human beings live and labor, singly and in concert, trying always to get more of what we want and need from the world around us.6





I intend this book to contribute to the larger project of constructing a more unified vision of history and of knowledge in general. I am well aware of the difficulties of that project. But I am sure that it is both doable and important, so it is worth attempting in the hope that others may eventually do it better. I am also convinced that a modern creation myth will turn out to be as rich and as beautiful as the creation myths of all earlier communities; it is a story that deserves telling even if the telling is imperfect.





STRUCTURE AND ORGANIZATION





utterly impossible as are all these events they are probably as like those which may have taken place as any others which never took person at all are ever likely to be



If the Eiffel Tower were now representing the world’s age, the skin of paint on the pinnacle-knob at its summit would represent man’s share of that age; and anybody would perceive that that skin was what the tower was built for. I reckon they would, I dunno.



Erwin Schrödinger, one of the pioneers of quantum physics, described the difficulties of constructing a more unified vision of knowledge in the preface to a book he wrote on a biological topic—the origins of life. His preface also offers the best justification I know for presuming to undertake such a project.



We have inherited from our forefathers the keen longing for unified, all-embracing knowledge. The very name given to the highest institutions of learning reminds us, that from antiquity and throughout many centuries the universal aspect has been the only one to be given full credit. But the spread, both in width and depth, of the multifarious branches of knowledge during the last hundred odd years has confronted us with a queer dilemma. We feel clearly that we are only now beginning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it.





I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true aim be lost forever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them—and at the risking of making fools of ourselves.

So much for my apology.7



Some of the most daunting problems posed by big history are organizational. What shape will a modern creation myth take? From what standpoint should it be written? What objects will take center stage? What time-scales will dominate?

A modern creation myth will not and cannot hope to be “neutral.” Modern knowledge offers no omniscient “knower,” no neutral observation point from which all objects, from quarks to humans to galaxies, have equal significance. We cannot be everywhere at once. So the very idea of knowledge from no particular point of view is senseless. (Technically, this statement reflects a philosophical position, associated with Nietzsche, known as perspectivism.) In any case, what use could such knowledge have? All knowledge arises from a relationship between a knower and an object of knowledge. And knowers expect to put knowledge to some use.

Creation stories, too, arise from a relationship between particular human communities and the universe as these communities imagine it. They offer answers to universal questions at many different scales, which is why they sometimes appear to have a nested structure similar to a Russian matryoshka doll—or to the Ptolemaic vision of the universe, with its many concentric shells. At the center are those trying to understand. At the outer edge is a totality of some kind: a universe or a deity. In between are entities that exist at different chronological, spatial, and mythic scales. It is thus the questions we ask that dictate the general shape of all creation myths. And because we are humans, humans are guaranteed to occupy more space in a creation myth than they do in the universe as a whole. A creation myth always belongs to someone; and the story recounted in this book is the creation myth of modern human beings, educated in the scientific traditions of the modern world. (Curiously, this means that the narrative structure of the modern creation myth, like all creation myths, may appear pre-Copernican, despite its definitely posf-Copernican content.)

Though its scope is vast, Maps of Time aims at not overwhelming the reader with detail. I have tried (without complete success) to stop the book from growing too large, in the hope that the details will not obscure the larger picture. Those with a particular interest in any one part of this story will have no difficulty finding out more, and the brief guides to further reading at the end of each chapter provide some starting points.

The exact balance of topics and themes in this book reflects the fact that this is an attempt at big history from a historian’s perspective, not that of an astronomer, a geologist, or a biologist. (Some alternative approaches to big history are listed at the end of this introduction.) This means that human societies loom larger than they do in, for example, Stephen Hawking’s books, or in Preston Cloud’s Cosmos, Earth, and Man (1978). Nevertheless, the first five chapters cover topics that normally fall within the sciences of cosmology, geology, and biology. They discuss the origins and evolution of the universe, of galaxies and stars, of the solar system and the earth, and of life on earth. The rest of the book surveys the history of our own species and its relationship to the earth and to other species. Chapters 6 and 7 discuss the origins of human beings and the nature of the earliest human societies. They attempt to identify what is distinctive about human history, and what distinguishes humans from other organisms inhabiting this earth. Chapter 8 examines the earliest agrarian societies, which existed without cities or states. With the emergence of agriculture, about 10,000 years ago, humans began for the first time to live in dense communities, in which exchanges of information and goods became more intensive than ever before. Chapters 9 and 10 describe the emergence and evolution of cities, of states, and of agrarian civilizations. Chapters 11 to 14 try to construct a coherent interpretation of the modern world and its origins. Finally, chapter 15 looks to the future. Big history is inevitably concerned with large trends, and these do not stop suddenly in the present moment. So a large view of the past inevitably raises questions about the future, and at least some answers are available, both for the near future (say, the next 100 years), and the remote future (the next few billion years). Raising such questions should be a vital part of modern education, for our assessments of the future will affect decisions taken today; these, in turn, may shape the world inhabited by our own children and grandchildren. They will not thank us if we take such tasks lightly.

A second organizational difficulty is thematic. It may seem there can be little coherence in a narrative that spans so many different scholarly disciplines. But there are phenomena that cross all scales. Above all, it turns out that the main actors are similar. At every level, we will be interested in ordered entities, from molecules to microbes to human societies to large chains of galaxies. Explaining how such things can exist, how they are born, how they evolve, and how, eventually, they perish is the stuff of history at all scales. Of course, each scale also has its own rules—chemical in the case of molecules, biological in the case of microbes—but the surprise is that some underlying principles of change may be universal. This is why Fred Spier has argued that at a fundamental level, big history is about “regimes.” It is about the fragile ordered patterns that appear at all scales, and the ways in which they change.8 So a central theme of big history is how the rules of change vary at different scales, despite some fundamental similarities in the nature of all change. Human history is different from cosmological history; but it is not totally different. I discuss some of the general principles of change in appendix 2, but the book as a whole will explore some of the different rules of change that appear at different scales.





FOR AND AGAINST BIG HISTORY




Specialists in many fields, from geology to archaeology and prehistory, will find it quite natural to look at the past on very large scales. But not everyone will be persuaded that big history is worth doing. Particularly to professional historians, the idea of exploring the past on such huge timescales can seem overambitious and perhaps simply impossible, a diversion from the real tasks of historical scholarship. In the last part of this introduction, I will respond to four main reservations that I have encountered.

The first is common, particularly among professional historians. It is that on large scales, history must thin out. It must lose detail, texture, particularity, and substance. Eventually, it must become vacuous. To be sure, on large scales, themes and problems familiar to professional historians may vanish, just as the details of a familiar landscape may disappear as one looks down from an airplane as it climbs. In a big history course, the French Revolution may get no more than a passing mention. But there are compensations. As the frame through which we view the past widens, features of the historical landscape that were once too large to fit in can be seen whole. We can begin to see the continents and oceans of the past, as well as the villages and roadways of national and regional histories. Frames of any kind exclude more than they reveal. And this is particularly true of the conventional time frames of modern historiography, which normally extend from a few years to a few centuries. Perhaps the most astonishing thing the conventional frames hide is humanity itself. Even on time frames of several thousand years, it is difficult to ask questions about the broader significance of human history within an evolving biosphere. Yet in a world with nuclear weapons and ecological problems that cross all national borders, we desperately need to see humanity as a whole. Accounts of the past that focus primarily on the divisions between nations, religions, and cultures are beginning to look parochial and anachronistic—even dangerous. So, it is not true that history becomes vacuous at large scales. Familiar objects may vanish, but new and important objects and problems come into view. And their presence can only enrich the discipline.

A second possible objection is that to write big history, historians will have to move beyond the boundaries of the discipline. Of course, this is true. Synoptic studies like this book are risky because the author depends on secondary sources and on other synoptic studies. As a result, there will inevitably be blunders and misunderstandings: error is built into the project. Indeed, it is part of the process of learning. To understand your own country, you must travel beyond its borders at least once in your life. You will not understand everything you see; but you may begin to see your own country in a new light. The same is true of history. To understand what is distinctive about human history, we must have some idea of how a biologist or a geologist might approach the subject. We cannot become biologists or geologists, and our understanding of these fields will have its limits; but we do have to use as skillfully as we can the expertise of specialists in other fields. And we have much to learn from their different perspectives on the past. Excessive respect for disciplinary boundaries has hidden many possibilities for intellectual synergy between disciplines. I will argue, for example, that we need the vision of a biologist to see what is truly distinctive about our type of animal, Homo sapiens.

Third, it may be objected that big history proposes to create a new “grand narrative” just when we have learned the futility, even the danger, of grand narratives. Will not a big history metanarrative crowd out alternative histories—of minorities, of regions, of particular nations or ethnic groups?9 Perhaps a fragmented vision of the past (a “jeweler’s-eye” view, in the phrase used by the anthropologists George Marcus and Michael Fischer) is the only one that can do real justice to the richness of human experience.10 Natalie Zemon Davis makes the point well:



The question remains whether a single master narrative is an adequate goal for global history. I think not. Master narratives are especially vulnerable to be taken over by patterns characteristic of the historian’s time and place, however useful they may be for accounting for some of the historical evidence. If a new decentred global history is discovering important alternative historical paths and trajectories, then it might also do well to let its big stories be alternate or multiple. The challenge for global history is to place these narratives creatively within an interactive frame.11





Once again, the charge is at least partly true. Narratives of some kind seem unavoidable when looking at the past on large scales, and they will certainly be shaped by contemporary concerns. Nevertheless, it is a mistake for historians to shun these large narratives, however grand they may seem. Like it or not, people will look for, and find, large stories, because they can provide a sense of meaning. As William Cronon has written of environmental history: “When we describe human activities within an ecosystem, we seem always to tell stories about them. Like all historians, we configure the events of the past into causal sequences—stories—that order and simplify those events to give them new meanings. We do so because narrative is the chief literary form that tries to find meaning in an overwhelmingly crowded and disordered chronological reality.”12 If paid intellectuals are too finicky to shape these stories, they will flourish all the same; but the intellectuals will be ignored and will eventually disenfranchise themselves. This is an abdication of responsibility particularly as intellectuals have played such a crucial role in creating many of today’s metanarratives. Metanarratives exist, they are powerful, and they are potent. We may be able to domesticate them; but we will never eradicate them. Besides, while grand narratives are powerful, subliminal grand narratives can be even more powerful. Yet a “modern creation myth” already exists just below the surface of modern knowledge. It exists in the dangerous form of poorly articulated and poorly understood fragments of modern knowledge that have undermined traditional accounts of reality without being integrated into a new vision of reality. Only when a modern creation myth has been teased out into a coherent story will it really be possible to take the next step: of criticizing it, deconstructing it, and perhaps improving it. In history as in building, construction must precede deconstruction. We must see the modern creation myth before we can criticize it. And we must articulate it before we can see it. Ernest Gellner made this point well in the introduction to his attempt at a synoptic view of history, Plough, Sword, and Book (1991):



The aim of the present volume is simple. It is to spell out, in the sharpest and perhaps exaggerated outline, a vision of human history which has been assuming shape of late, but which has not yet been properly codified. The attempt to bring it to the surface is not made because the author has any illusions about knowing it to be true: he does not. Definitive and final truth is not granted to theories in general. In particular, it is unlikely to attach to theories covering an infinite diversity of extremely complex facts, well beyond the reach of any one scholar. The vision is formulated in the hope that its clear and forceful statement will make possible its critical examination.13





Besides, a “grand narrative” of the kind offered in this book may prove surprisingly capacious. In the global “truth” market of the twenty-first century, all narratives face stiff competition. The many detailed stories of the past already taught in our schools and universities ensure that a modern creation myth will emerge not as a single monolithic story but rather as a large and ramshackle cycle of stories, each of which can be told in many ways and with many variants. Indeed, it may turn out that the very large narratives create more space for alternative accounts of the past that struggle to survive within existing (and less ample) history syllabi. As Patrick O’Brien has written, “Hopefully as more historians risk writing on a global scale, the field will achieve a reputation and produce competing metanarratives to which the overwhelming flow of parish, regional and national histories could be reconnected.”14

The fourth objection is closely related to the third: is not a narrative on this huge scale bound to make exaggerated truth claims? I have found in teaching big history that students struggle to find a balance between two extreme positions. On the one hand, they are tempted to suppose that a modern, “scientific” account of origins is true, while all earlier accounts were more or less false. On the other hand, faced with some of the uncertainties of modern accounts of the past, they may be tempted to think that this is “just one more story.”

Thinking of a big history narrative as a modern creation myth is a good way of helping students to find the epistemological point of balance between these extremes. For it is a reminder, first, that all accounts of reality are provisional. Many of the stories we tell today will seem quaint and childish in a few centuries, just as many elements of traditional creation myths seem naive today. But by acknowledging this, we do not commit ourselves to a nihilistic relativism. All knowledge systems, from modern science to those embedded in the most ancient of creation myths, can be thought of as maps of reality. They are never just true or false. Perfect descriptions of reality are unattainable, unnecessary, and too costly for learning organisms, including humans. But workable descriptions are indispensable. So knowledge systems, like maps, are a complex blend of realism, flexibility, usefulness, and inspiration. They must offer a description of reality that conforms in some degree to commonsense experience. But that description must also be useful. It must help solve the problems that need to be solved by each community, whether these be spiritual, psychological, political, or mechanical.15

In their day, all creation myths offered workable maps of reality, and that is why they were believed. They made sense of what people knew. They contained much good, empirical knowledge; and their large structures helped people place themselves within a wider reality. But each map had to build on the knowledge and fulfill the needs of a particular society. And that is why they don’t necessarily count as “true” outside their home environments. A modern creation myth need not apologize for being equally parochial. It must start with modern knowledge and modern questions, because it is designed for people who live in the modern world. We need to try to understand our universe even if we can be certain that our attempts can never fully succeed. So, the strongest claim we can make about the truth of a modern creation myth is that it offers a unified account of origins from the perspective of the early twenty-first century.





FURTHER READING ON BIG HISTORY




Listed below are a number of works in English that explore the past on scales larger than those of world history, or try to see human history in its wider context, or provide methodological frameworks for such attempts. This is a wide definition of “big history,” and there are doubtless many other works that could be included under it. The authors come from many different fields, and the books vary greatly in approach and quality, so there is plenty of room for argument as to which do and which do not really count as big history books. This preliminary bibliography is based on a list first compiled by Fred Spier. It excludes books so technical that they cannot possibly be of use to historians or general readers. It also excludes a vast number of books that operate at large scales, and have much to offer historians, but do not try to move across multiple timescales.
