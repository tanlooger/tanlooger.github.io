“People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel.… I understand politics on a deeper level.”

—Xi Jinping


“In their minds, princelings believe that ‘all under heaven are ours to rule; if we don’t do it, who will?’ ”

—Cai Xia, former Central Party School professor


“Going into politics means one cannot dream of getting rich. Just as Sun Yat-sen said, one must set their mind to do great things.”

—Xi Jinping



On a chilly, overcast morning in the spring of 2018, China crowned a president who may rule for life. The gloomy skies over Beijing shed a sliver of snowfall as nearly three thousand lawmakers arrived for the occasion at the Great Hall of the People, a cavernous coliseum that has hosted some of the nation’s grandest pageantry since the Mao era. These officials, soldiers, entrepreneurs, scholars, workers, and villagers had gathered from across China to ruminate on affairs of the state, an annual assembly choreographed to portray a nation united in harmony. Together they constitute the National People’s Congress, a legislative body that is controlled by the Communist Party but claims to channel the collective will of 1.4 billion people. Tasked with choosing a head of state that day, they voted as one, for the only man on the ballot: Xi Jinping.

The unanimous result drew rapturous applause from lawmakers, who cheered their newly re-elected president with a standing ovation. Dressed in a dark business suit with a violet tie, Xi clapped briefly and bowed in a customary show of humility. Minutes later, after a military band played a rousing rendition of the national anthem, Xi strode toward the lectern. Raising his right fist and placing his left palm flat on a copy of China’s constitution, Xi recited his oath of office with a measured cadence, vowing to “build a modern socialist power that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful.”1

For the first time in thirty-five years, a Chinese head of state was inaugurated with no limits on his tenure. And in a departure from two decades of precedent, a Chinese president was starting his second term without a deputy young enough to be his successor. Xi could stay in office indefinitely, and was in effect telling the world that he would.

China’s presidency is largely ceremonial. An incumbent signs legislation into effect, appoints senior government officials, and conducts the pomp and ceremony of statecraft. In Chinese, the title literally means “state chairman,” echoing Chairman Mao’s most famous honorific. The head of state is China’s face to the world, presented to audiences abroad as “president,” a label shorn of the authoritarian aura that shrouds leaders of one-party regimes. And while he does possess the awesome executive authority wielded by counterparts in the United States and Russia, those powers come not from the presidency, but from two other roles he concurrently serves.

The first is general secretary of the Communist Party’s Central Committee, the highest office in a sprawling political machine that boasts more than 96 million members and has governed China since 1949. The other is chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission, a council of mostly martial men who command the armed forces. These positions are the true keys to the Middle Kingdom, controlling the most powerful organs of state in one of the world’s most populous nations. It was these two posts that Xi acquired when taking power in November 2012, months before his first inauguration as president in the following spring.

Only one office in this trinity, the state presidency, had been constrained by clear term limits. Constitutional decree, until 2018, compelled the president to step aside after two five-year terms. The party positions of general secretary and military-commission chairman faced no such restraint. While the party’s governing charter prohibited life tenure for its leaders, it didn’t specify how long they could hold office. The party had provisional regulations stating that officials in leadership roles couldn’t stay in the same post beyond ten years, or remain at the same level of the party for more than fifteen. But these rules could be easily revised or revoked, and some insiders said they didn’t apply to top leaders.2

The restriction on presidential terms dated back to the early 1980s, when China was still reeling from the upheavals unleashed by its last leader to rule for life. From his proclamation of the People’s Republic in 1949 till his death in 1976, Mao Zedong ran a brutal dictatorship that ravaged China with mass purges, economic collapse, and one of history’s deadliest famines. His despotic instincts spurred bloody suppressions of dissent and perceived class enemies. His ideological dogma drove the “Great Leap Forward,” a disastrous attempt to industrialize China’s agrarian economy that ended up starving tens of millions to death. His megalomania enkindled the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution, a fanatical movement that purported to defend China against capitalist restoration but tore society asunder.

The task of healing this generational trauma fell to Deng Xiaoping, a revered revolutionary who deposed Mao’s successor to become paramount leader. Already in his seventies when he took power, Deng devoted himself to stamping out the vestiges of Maoism and devising safeguards against one-man rule. In a landmark 1980 speech, he called for reforms to encourage power-sharing, promote succession, and ensure that no leadership post could be held indefinitely.3 His demands yielded China’s 1982 constitution, which imposed term limits on major offices of state—like the presidency and the premiership—that allowed appointees to serve no more than two consecutive stints of five years.

But Deng operated above his own strictures, never serving as the titular party chief or head of state even as he wielded preponderant sway until his death in 1997. He fashioned himself a trustee of the nation, whose job was to deliver a stable and prosperous China by creating power structures conducive to collective leadership and peaceful succession.4 He allowed his protégés and peers to hold office as general secretary, premier, and president, while he kept control over the People’s Liberation Army as military commission chairman. This arrangement crumbled in the heat of crisis during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, when divisions within the leadership hampered a decisive response. Deng ultimately decided to crush the demonstrations with deadly force, and purged the incumbent general secretary—a protégé whom he blamed for supporting the protesters and splitting the party.

Deng tried a different tack after sending the PLA to put down the protests in what became known as the June 4 massacre. He opted to centralize key powers with one man, who would be kept in check by influential peers. His choice of heir was Jiang Zemin, a compromise candidate plucked from Shanghai to replace the previous general secretary. When Jiang assumed the presidency in 1993, he became the first Chinese leader since Mao to hold office as head of the party, military, and state concurrently. Even so, Jiang often found himself hemmed in by powerful rivals and had to govern as “first among equals.” He couldn’t even pick his successor, a choice all but made for him by Deng.

Jiang stepped down as party chief and president on time, in late 2002 and early 2003 respectively, but clung to his military title for roughly two more years. His successor, Hu Jintao, a colorless technocrat, was even more scrupulous in abiding by the ten-year limit. Hu handed over all three posts to Xi on schedule, completing the smoothest leadership transition that Communist China had managed to date. Analysts marveled at the achievement, declaring that the party had translated constitutional procedure into established practice, and allowed Chinese politics to evince a predictability that a few decades earlier would have seemed unthinkable.

Xi started reversing this trajectory almost immediately. He named himself head of party committees overseeing economic reforms, internet policy, military overhauls, and national security—prompting Australian sinologist Geremie Barmé to call him the “Chairman of Everything.”5 Just eighteen months after taking power, Xi was appearing in the party mouthpiece People’s Daily with a frequency unseen since Mao, and nearly twice as often as his predecessor.6 Xi sidelined the party’s number two leader, Premier Li Keqiang, and siphoned off the prime minister’s traditional influence over economic affairs. The Central Committee acclaimed Xi as the “core” of the party’s fifth-generation leadership, cementing his preeminence with a title that had eluded the feeble Hu.

Xi stepped up his power grab at the party’s nineteenth national congress in 2017, when he rewrote the party charter to include a political slogan bearing his name: “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.” Only Mao and Deng had enjoyed such an honor previously, with “Mao Zedong Thought” and “Deng Xiaoping Theory” consecrated alongside Marxism-Leninism as the party’s guiding ideologies. “Writing Xi Jinping’s name into the party charter is like making his words part of the holy scripture,” said Ding Xueliang, a Hong Kong–based professor and expert on Chinese politics. “As long as Xi’s alive, his words would matter. He would have the final say.”7

Just as tellingly, the congress didn’t promote to the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s top decision-making body, anyone young enough to be considered Xi’s successor. For the first time in two decades, an incumbent general secretary was starting his second term without an understudy. China’s chattering classes went wild with speculation that Xi would outstay his expected decade as leader. The rumors intensified when the party announced weeks later that it was drafting unspecified changes to the national constitution.

Xi revealed his hand in late February 2018, just a week before China started its annual legislative session. The government-run Xinhua News Agency issued a bulletin listing twenty-one proposed amendments, with the bombshell tucked away fourteenth on the list. Article 79, which defined the terms of office for the president and vice president, would be trimmed, removing a clause stating that the head of state and their deputy “shall serve no more than two consecutive terms.”

The proposal shocked many Chinese. Their country may have attained the trappings of capitalist modernity—sleek skylines, glitzy consumer brands, and high-tech infrastructure—but their politics was backsliding toward what many considered a bygone era. Wang Gongquan, a venture capitalist turned activist, denounced the planned amendment as “a reversal in our political culture.” Some social media users shared images of Winnie the Pooh—the cartoon bear whom Xi purportedly resembles—dressed as a Chinese emperor.8 Others joked that China was becoming “West Korea” by mimicking the despotic Kim dynasty in Pyongyang. Immigration consultants noted an uptick in queries from Chinese citizens considering new lives abroad.

Censors and propagandists went into overdrive. State media justified the scrapping of presidential term limits as necessary for giving China the “centralized and unified leadership” that it needs. The People’s Daily assured readers that “this amendment doesn’t portend changes to the retirement system for leading party and state officials, nor does it mean life tenure for leading cadres.”9 Officials feted Xi with reverential labels like “helmsman” and lingxiu, or leader, that were closely associated with Mao. The party chief of the northwestern province of Qinghai, home to a large Tibetan Buddhist population, said authorities there encouraged resettled nomadic herders to “love their leader” by hanging Xi portraits in their new homes. Ordinary folks called Xi “a living Bodhisattva,” he said, using a Buddhist term for enlightened devotees who carry out altruistic acts.10

When the constitutional changes were put to a vote at the National People’s Congress in March 2018, just six of the 2,964 delegates present demurred, casting two dissents, three abstentions, and one invalid vote to yield a 99.8 percent approval rate. The result inspired gallows humor among some Chinese liberals, who mused that the dissenting delegates were the modern-day “six gentlemen of Wuxu,” a group of intellectuals executed by the imperial Qing government in 1898 for championing ill-fated political reforms. The vast majority of lawmakers, meanwhile, fawned over their leader. “Under President Xi’s leadership, we are certain to achieve the ‘China Dream,’ ” said Song Fengnian, a septuagenarian NPC member who wore a Mao suit for the occasion, complete with a Communist Party flag pin and a Mao badge. “This is the wish of the people.” Days later, the legislature voted unanimously to give Xi a second term as president.

The party now recounts Xi’s rise with the teleological certitude it uses for proclaiming China’s inexorable return to greatness. But there was nothing preordained about his ascent. Xi suffered political persecution during his formative years, his career in local and regional government appeared undistinguished, and his rivals sometimes seemed likelier to succeed. When he first emerged as heir apparent, some observers argued that the party’s kingmakers saw in Xi a pliable puppet, crediting his rise to his perceived weakness.

Nicholas Kristof, a former China correspondent and Pulitzer Prize winner, made a bold prediction in a January 2013 op-ed for the New York Times: “The new paramount leader, Xi Jinping, will spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao’s body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize–winning writer, will be released from prison.” Kristof was optimistic that “change is coming” to China under a new leader who inherited reformist instincts from his late father, the revolutionary hero Xi Zhongxun. “I’m betting that in the coming 10 years of Xi’s reign, China will come alive again,” he wrote.11 Some Chinese intellectuals even suggested that Xi could emulate Taiwan’s President Chiang Ching-kuo, who before his death in 1988 started reforms that spurred the island’s transition to democracy from the military dictatorship imposed by his father, Chiang Kai-shek.

Such optimism was misplaced. Mao remained in his hallowed mausoleum. Authorities released Liu from prison in 2017, but only on medical parole before he died of cancer while receiving treatment under police guard. Xi secured a third term as party chief in 2022 and seems set to stay in power for many years to come. Change did come to China, just not the kind for which Kristof and others hoped.

Xi’s first decade in power has laid bare his hyper-authoritarian doctrine. He sidelined rivals, purged corrupt and indolent officials, and demanded unstinting loyalty from the rank and file. He quashed activism, silenced dissent, and built an unprecedentedly sophisticated surveillance state to assert control over society. He padded the party’s Marxist maxims with Confucian wisdoms and rallied nationalistic fervor around one-party rule. As some historians now argue, the paternal legacy that Xi inherited wasn’t his father’s liberal leanings, but his unstinting devotion to the party and its interests, regardless of private doubt.12

The misjudgment of Xi was no accident. To ascend the byzantine world of Chinese politics, where officials who advertise allegiances too firmly expose themselves to reprisals when orthodoxies change, Xi made himself inoffensive and inscrutable in his early career. He appeared amenable to friends and rivals alike, with his public remarks seldom straying from perfunctory praise for party policies and routine condemnation of corruption and red tape. Unvarnished accounts of his personal life are rare and patchy. In 2000, while he was a provincial governor, Xi said he had rejected more than one hundred interview requests.13 Even some of Xi’s fellow princelings concede to having misjudged a longtime friend.

Nonetheless, as the celebrated American biographer Robert Caro observed, power reveals. “When a man is climbing, trying to persuade others to give him power, concealment is necessary: to hide traits that might make others reluctant to give him power, to hide also what he wants to do with that power,” Caro wrote in the fourth volume of his biography of U.S. president Lyndon Johnson. “But as a man obtains more power, camouflage is less necessary. The curtain begins to rise. The revealing begins.”14

With the benefit of hindsight, Xi’s words and deeds, paired with contemporary and retrospective accounts from those who knew him, offer a more complete and complex portrait of China’s most dominant leader since Mao. It reveals a man fired with ambition and steeled by adversity; a red aristocrat who embraced his noblesse oblige and sees leadership as a birthright; a flexible apparatchik who trimmed his sails to prevailing orthodoxies; and a savvy streetfighter who sidestepped scandals and exploited good fortune to carve a path to power.





A PRINCELING’S BIRTH


XI JINPING WAS BORN ON June 15, 1953, in Beijing, the third of four children to a revolutionary couple.15 His given name, a nod to the capital’s old appellation of Beiping, can translate as “near peace.” His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a propaganda minister at the time, brought into the central government after decades of distinguished military service against Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist Party and the invading Japanese army. His mother, Qi Xin, joined the revolution during World War II and worked at an elite party academy. Less than four years after Mao proclaimed the People’s Republic, the Communist leadership was grappling with the realities of nation-building, from formulating their first five-year plan for economic development to negotiating an armistice to end the Korean War. Those were difficult but heady years, buoyed by patriotic zeal and a sense of possibility in forging a “new China.”

Many second-generation reds, or hongerdai, grew up in a bubble of relative luxury in central Beijing. Families of senior officials typically lived in large courtyard homes, enjoyed access to foreign books and films, and sent their children to top schools. Privileges were pegged to rank, and those who qualified could enjoy perks such as official cars, security details, superior health care, and access to exclusive entertainment venues and summer resorts.16 In 1956, salaries for top Communist Party and government officials were 36.4 times the wages earned by the lowest-level bureaucrats—far outstripping the equivalent pay gap within Chiang’s Nationalist government in 1946, when top officials out-earned the most junior ranks by 14.5 times.17

Even so, party histories remember Xi Zhongxun as a virtuous politician who enforced austerity and rectitude at home.18 His marriage to Qi Xin in 1944 was his second, a union that bore two daughters—Qi Qiaoqiao in 1949 and Xi An’an in 1951—and two sons, Xi Jinping and Xi Yuanping, the latter born in 1956. Qi Xin had to live at the party academy, so the elder Xi spent more time caring for their children—bathing them, washing their clothes, and taking them on weekend outings.19 The patriarch told so many stories about his revolutionary exploits that his children’s ears “grew calluses,” Xi Jinping later recalled.20 “Among the children in our family, Jinping was the most mischievous and the smartest,” Xi’s half brother Zhengning told an acquaintance. “Father loved him the most.”21

Xi Zhongxun was a strict and frugal parent. He often declined gifts for his children. He taught them to save water and electricity. He often forced his sons to wake up late at night and wash themselves in bathwater he had used earlier—a practice that Xi Jinping later said he feared most during his childhood.22 The patriarch also made his sons wear their elder sisters’ castoff clothes, which on one occasion made Xi Jinping cry before his father pacified him by dyeing the clothes black with ink, Qi recalled.23 Each Xi child commuted to school by bus and received so little pocket money that if they splurged on ice sticks, they wouldn’t be able to afford their bus fares and had to walk home. The elder Xi instructed his personal aide not to indulge his children if they asked for extra cash.24 “Sometimes,” Qi later wrote in an essay, “I really felt that you were too demanding of our children.”25

Xi Zhongxun insisted that his children finish every scrap of food, even dropped rice grains, and often cited a verse from Tang dynasty poet Li Shen: “Hoeing grass under the noonday sun, his sweat drips onto the soil beneath. Who knows that the food on their plate, every grain came from hardship.”26 His children would answer with another Li verse: “A single seed sown in spring, yields ten thousand grains by autumn. No field in the world lies fallow, yet farmers still die of hunger.”27

The elder Xi saw himself as “a son of peasants.”28 Born into a rural landowning family in China’s northern province of Shaanxi in 1913, he encountered Marxism in school and joined the Communist Youth League in 1926, when he was just twelve. Two years later, Xi spent time in jail for inciting student protests and became a full-fledged party member—at the age of fourteen—during the months he spent in prison. He became a guerrilla fighter after his release, establishing himself as a young commander as he helped set up a revolutionary base in Shaanxi and its neighboring province of Gansu. His prodigious career almost ended in 1935, when party rivals accused him of disloyalty and threatened to bury him alive before Mao intervened. Undeterred by the experience, he proved his mettle in combat against Nationalist forces and Japanese invaders. Mao praised Xi for his selfless service to the revolution, and in 1943 gifted him a piece of calligraphy: “The party’s interests come first.”29

After the Communist victory, Xi oversaw political and military affairs in northwestern China as a regional official, before Mao summoned him to Beijing in 1952 to become the party’s propaganda minister. The following year, he took an assignment as secretary general at the State Council, as China’s cabinet is known, where he assisted Premier Zhou Enlai in policy-making. He continued climbing the hierarchy through the decade, winning promotion to the party’s Central Committee in 1956 and then vice premier in 1959.

Notwithstanding Xi’s efforts to shield his children from morally corrosive privilege, they received some of the best schooling that Maoist China had to offer. A young Xi Jinping went to the Beihai Kindergarten, an elite facility that catered to offspring of senior officials, established in 1949 on the grounds of an imperial altar near the Forbidden City and the Zhongnanhai leadership compound housing the party and government’s headquarters. He then attended elementary school and junior high at the exclusive Bayi School, named after the PLA’s founding anniversary on August 1.30

Founded in 1947 to educate the children of Red Army officials as well as revolutionary veterans and martyrs, the Bayi School drew on military tradition and discipline. Students lived on campus, performed morning calisthenics, sang revolutionary songs, and formed ranks for meals and roll calls. Its Beijing premises, built in the early 1950s, comprised modern furnishings, heated classrooms and dorms, and even its own farm that supplied students with pork, eggs, milk, and watermelons.31

Alumni from the Mao era recall a campus steeped in machismo, where students often brawled, hurled profanities, and disdained “softness and delicateness.”32 Populated with the children of high-ranking cadres, known colloquially as gaogan zidi, the school also drew ridicule as an “aristocratic” institution misaligned with the party’s egalitarian ideals. Many students were lackadaisical about their studies and carried themselves with a sense of entitlement, often comparing and goading each other over their fathers’ ranks and relative wealth. “We didn’t sense it while we were inside,” Liu Huixuan, a Bayi alumnus who spent a dozen years at the school from the 1950s to the 1960s, said in an autobiographical account. “But after leaving Bayi School and comparing, only then did we realize that place was really a jar of honey.”33

Xi was about a year younger than most of his classmates. One of his primary-school teachers, Tian Luying, remembered him as a kind and conscientious pupil who enjoyed playing soccer.34 Chen Qiuying, who taught Xi in middle school, recalled an inquisitive student who brought questions to teachers after class and admired the ancient Chinese poet Du Fu.35

Political turmoil breached the Bayi bubble. Mao’s Great Leap Forward, a radical program launched in 1958 to transform an agrarian society into an industrial powerhouse, instead devastated agriculture and caused mass starvation that killed tens of millions. Even Bayi’s relative luxuries couldn’t prevent students from going hungry during the Great Famine of 1959 to 1961. Some recalled eating spoiled buns and meals made from stale grain contaminated with rat feces.36

The economic disaster fueled party infighting. Senior leaders tried to rein in Mao’s radical policies. Mao and his loyalists struck back, engineering intrigue against perceived rivals. Xi Zhongxun fell victim in the fall of 1962, when the leadership purged him for allegedly leading an anti-party clique that sought to seize power.37

The purported proof of Xi’s conspiracy was his support for the publication of a novel celebrating the revolutionary martyr Liu Zhidan. The book featured characters modeled after Xi and another prominent revolutionary, Gao Gang, who fought alongside Liu in northwestern China before Liu was killed in 1936. Xi worked closely with Gao through the mid-1940s, though their paths had diverged by the time Gao was purged in 1954 for trying to oust two other party elders. Gao’s name became a byword for treachery, and he killed himself later that year.

Mao’s security chief, Kang Sheng, denounced the novel as a manifesto for Xi Zhongxun and his alleged co-conspirators. “Making use of a novel to carry out anti-party activities is a major invention,” Kang wrote in a note to Mao, who read it aloud during a Central Committee meeting and effectively condemned Xi.38 Despite Xi’s protests of innocence, the party stripped him of his posts and revoked almost all the official perks that his family had enjoyed.

Xi struggled emotionally with his downfall, and Zhou Enlai told Qi Xin to make sure that her husband didn’t try to harm himself, according to historian Joseph Torigian, who cited memoirs, unpublished diaries, and interviews with friends of the family.39 In an essay, Qi recalled her husband sitting silently in the living room with the lights off, a puzzling sight for their younger daughter An’an, who asked: “Daddy, what’s the matter?” Their younger son, Yuanping, asked: “Daddy, why aren’t you going to Zhongnanhai?”40

Xi Jinping’s Bayi classmates likely ostracized him. The party categorized people by their jieji chengfen, a concept of class status akin to a caste system, and Xi Zhongxun’s downfall tainted his family. Liu, the Bayi alumnus, recalled a fellow student whose application to join the Communist Youth League was rejected because his father was allegedly associated with the elder Xi.41

The party eventually ordered Xi Zhongxun to undergo political education at the Central Party School, where he was confined inside his house and made to study writings by Marx, Lenin, and Mao, as well as avoid interaction with outsiders.42 In summer 1965, Xi wrote to Mao asking to be sent to work in the countryside. Mao had other ideas, dispatching him instead to the central city of Luoyang to become a deputy manager at a tractor factory. Xi wouldn’t see his family for seven years.





DISASTROUS DECADE


THE WORST WAS TO COME for the Xis. In May 1966, Mao launched what would become the most radical and destructive of his mass purges: the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Historians believe Mao’s goals were twofold. Stung by his loss of prestige from the Great Leap Forward, the Chairman wanted to reclaim his authority that other party elders had siphoned from him. The movement, as Mao envisioned, would also tear down the party’s ossifying bureaucracy, cleanse its ranks of self-serving apparatchiks, and restore revolutionary fervor to China.

Mao declared that the party had been infiltrated by bourgeois elements seeking to restore capitalism, and urged his supporters to wage violent class struggle to eliminate these so-called revisionists. Militant students answered his call, forming “Red Guards” to defend the revolution. Mobs of fanatical youth hurled abuse and tortured alleged counter-revolutionaries in public “struggle sessions.” Marauding Red Guards rampaged through museums, libraries, and religious sites to destroy art, books, and cultural relics regarded as the “Four Olds” of Chinese society—old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas. Many of their victims, from officials and their relatives to famous artists and writers, were injured, killed, or driven to suicide.

Xi Zhongxun, already a pariah, suffered further persecution, getting abused in struggle sessions and thrown into detention. Red Guards ransacked his home, and his wife and children were forced out of Beijing. Official accounts say his eldest daughter, Heping, the oldest of three children with his first wife, was “persecuted to death,” which some historians and party insiders say meant that she was hounded into killing herself.

Xi Jinping was turning thirteen when the Cultural Revolution began. While many hongerdai formed their own Red Guard units, Xi was too young and tainted by his father to join. Peers pilloried and publicly shamed him. Chen, the Bayi teacher, recalled how Xi once told her about a physical education teacher who bullied him and denounced him for being a child of “black gangs,” an epithet for politically disgraced officials. “During the 10-year catastrophe of the ‘Cultural Revolution,’ he endured a lot of arduous trials,” Chen wrote. “But he believed the dark clouds would always disperse, and that under any circumstance, one should be full of confidence in the future.”43

After Red Guards forced the Bayi School to shut down in 1967, Xi moved to Beijing’s Number 25 Middle School along with Liu Weiping, a son of a general who had been purged for crossing one of Mao’s top lieutenants. The pair befriended Nie Weiping, a student at the Number 25 school who would become a grandmaster of the ancient board game of Go. Nie himself had fallen into disgrace after his parents were accused of colluding with black gangs. Together the boys became known as the “three Pings,” a nod to the common character in their names.

With little classroom education on offer, Xi often roamed the streets and read books taken from deserted schools and libraries, according to a family friend.44 On one occasion, the trio heard that feuding Red Guard factions were gathering at a Beijing school, and they went over to see what would happen. Soon after the three arrived and joined a large group of gathered students, militants sprung their ambush from the school hall. “Hundreds of people wielding clubs came shouting and rushing out, and they beat whomever they saw,” Nie wrote in a memoir.45 “The three of us turned and ran to where we locked our bicycles,” he recalled. “Xi Jinping and I moved fast and escaped, but Liu Weiping ran a step slower and was beaten into a concussion.”

Xi escaped physical injury but not psychological trauma. In interviews and writings decades later, he recounted how he was jailed three to four times and pressed into struggle sessions, where Red Guards hurled slurs and threatened to execute him.46 “Because I was stubborn and unwilling to be bullied, I offended the rebel faction,” Xi told a state-run magazine in 2000.47 “Anything that was bad was blamed upon me; they thought I was a leader.” At one point, Red Guards denounced Xi as “anti-revolutionary” for allegedly speaking up against the Cultural Revolution, forced him to wear a cone-shaped dunce cap, and paraded him at a public-shaming rally, according to one of his father’s associates, Yang Ping, who recounted conversations with Xi Zhongxun and other members of his family.48 Qi Xin attended the struggle session, and “when they yelled, ‘Down with Xi Jinping!’ on the stage, his mother was forced to raise her arm and shout the slogan along with everyone,” Yang wrote.

“They asked me how bad I thought my crimes were,” Xi Jinping recalled of one encounter with Red Guards. “I said that they should make a guess, was it enough to deserve being shot? They said it would be enough to be shot 100 times over. I thought, what was the difference between being shot once and 100 times?”49

Xi slipped out of detention one rainy night and ran home cold and hungry, hoping his mother would make him some food. But instead of feeding her son, Qi Xin reported him, worried that she would get detained for sheltering a “counter-revolutionary” and leave two of her other children by themselves with no one to care for them. Xi understood his mother’s decision and ran off to find another hiding place, but was caught the next day, Yang wrote.50

In interviews recounting his experiences during the Cultural Revolution, Xi suggested that his family’s misfortunes taught him the brutality of politics. To survive, and one day flourish, he would have to lie low and bide his time.51 “People who have little contact with power, who are far from it, always see these things as mysterious and novel,” Xi told a party-run magazine in 2000. “But what I see is not just the superficial things: the power, the flowers, the glory, the applause. I see the cowsheds”—makeshift detention houses—“and how people can blow hot and cold. I understand politics on a deeper level.”52

The Mao era left a complex mark on Xi. Some historians believe the chaos of the Cultural Revolution seeded his fixation with authoritarian order. As paramount leader, Xi would acknowledge Mao’s mistakes but also quote his maxims and borrow his political tactics. The hardship Xi endured also would become an asset, placing him on the right side of this dark history while many of his peers had to conceal their involvement in Red Guard atrocities.

By late 1968, Xi had been assigned to a juvenile detention center, but the facility had no spare beds and he would have to wait a month before moving in. Right around then, Mao issued a call for urban youth to get “re-educated” by living and working in rural areas, a movement known as “Up to the Mountains and Down to the Countryside.” Though the program had started years before as a way to ease urban unemployment, historians believe Mao ramped up the campaign to quell the rabid Red Guards who were barreling beyond his control. More than 17 million young Chinese were rusticated, or “sent down,” across China between the 1960s and 1970s. Eager to escape persecution in Beijing, Xi joined the exodus.





RUSTICATED YOUTH


NEARLY THIRTY THOUSAND BEIJING YOUTH went to the countryside around Yan’an, a desolate stretch of northern Shaanxi that served as Mao’s revolutionary base between the mid-1930s and late 1940s. Perched on the windswept Loess Plateau, a dusty highland known for its loose yellow earth, Yan’an in the late 1960s was impoverished and isolated—an unforgiving crucible for city dwellers forced into rural life.

A fifteen-year-old Xi started his journey in January 1969. He felt something close to joy as the train prepared to leave Beijing. “Everyone was crying, there wasn’t anyone on the entire train who didn’t cry,” Xi said in a 2004 television interview. “Only I was smiling. Of course, my relatives beside the train asked me, ‘Why are you smiling?’ I said if I didn’t leave then I’d be crying. If I didn’t leave, I wouldn’t even know if I’d survive staying here.”53

The Xi family has deep roots in Shaanxi. Xi Zhongxun’s first wife, Hao Mingzhu, was a fellow Shaanxi native, while his second marriage took place there as well. Five of his seven children from both marriages were born in Shaanxi. His brother, Xi Zhongkai, held senior roles in the provincial government. That Xi Zhongxun languished in the political wilderness for a decade and a half before his rehabilitation after the Cultural Revolution “made his political associations in Shaanxi more important,” wrote Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution.54 Xi Jinping too would regard his seven years in Shaanxi as the most defining period of his life.

Conditions on the Loess Plateau were grueling. Many newcomers struggled to cope with the harsh landscape, deprivation, and physical labor. A memorial in a Yan’an park lists the names of seventy-six rusticated youth from Beijing who lost their lives, including thirty-two who died during work and more than forty who passed away from disease and unnatural causes.55 Some of them drowned because they naively tried to escape flash floods by running alongside the river.56

Xi Jinping was among fifteen youths assigned to Liangjiahe, a cluster of more than sixty households living in hillside cave dwellings, located about 160 miles northeast of his father’s birthplace. Locals recalled a tall, slim, and introverted teenager who arrived with two heavy cases of books. Xi’s time in the village started inauspiciously. Soon after arriving, he found a piece of stale bread in his bag and fed it to a dog, drawing attention from a villager who asked him what it was. His earnest response—that it was bread—sent residents gossiping about how Xi was a pampered urbanite who wasted precious food.

Rural hardships shocked Xi. “The first test was the flea test,” he recalled in the 2004 interview.57 “When I first got there, the thing I couldn’t stand the most were the fleas. I don’t know if they’re still there. The fleas at the time, my skin was very allergic to them, their bites would turn my skin into swathes of red sores that became blisters that burst. Ah, it was so painful you didn’t want to live.”

Xi lived in a cave dwelling, shared with others, and typically rose at 6 a.m. to do menial farm work. He disliked the bland meals and often shirked the hard labor in the fields, even picking up a smoking habit so that he could take rest breaks rolling cigarettes for a puff. Overwhelmed by the drudgery, he ran back to Beijing after just three months, but was soon caught and detained for nearly half a year. Xi’s maternal aunt, Qi Yun, and her husband admonished him for turning his back on the masses, and regaled him with stories about how they, as revolutionaries in Shaanxi decades earlier, cultivated close ties with ordinary folk. “I listened to them,” Xi later recounted, and returned to Liangjiahe determined to overcome his misgivings about rural life.58

By his third year in Liangjiahe, Xi had mastered farm work and could speak the local dialect fluently. He plowed fields, ferried manure, and harvested wheat. He later claimed, rather incredibly, that he could carry two hundred jin of wheat for ten li, or about two hundred twenty pounds for just over three miles, without switching shoulders.59 Around the village, he helped fetch water, cook meals, and dig new cave dwellings. Inside his cave, he sewed blankets, mended clothes, and read books into the night, smoking cigarettes by a small oil lamp.

Official accounts described Xi as a voracious reader who devoured titles like the Communist Manifesto, Lenin’s The State and Revolution, and Mao’s works on revolutionary strategy. He read books while herding sheep and learned new words from a dictionary during rest breaks from tilling fields. Decades later, Xi would often mention his appetite for books, saying he once walked thirty li, or a little more than nine miles, just to borrow a copy of Goethe’s Faust.

The specter of persecution loomed large even in Liangjiahe. Xi, who sometimes gossiped about party intrigue with other rusticated youth, almost landed in trouble after a local cadre discovered that a letter he wrote contained references to Mao’s wife, Jiang Qing. The cadre threatened to report Xi, but a mutual acquaintance appeased him by offering a gift of two military jackets.60 Xi credited some of the goodwill he received to his father’s reputation in Shaanxi.

Xi only saw his father again in 1972, after his mother asked Premier Zhou Enlai to arrange a family reunion. The patriarch could neither recognize his sons nor tell his two daughters apart. “He wept when he saw us, and I quickly offered him a cigarette and lit one up for myself as well,” the younger Xi recalled. “He asked me, ‘How come you also smoke?’ I said: ‘I’m depressed. We’ve also made it through tough times over these years.’ He went quiet for a moment and said, ‘I grant you approval to smoke.’ ”61

Both father and son kept their faith in the party, blaming their persecution on security chief Kang Sheng and his wife Cao Yi’ou.62 While some of his peers scorned the party, the younger Xi decided to join it. He first sought membership in the Communist Youth League, though officials repeatedly rejected his applications due to his father’s sullied standing. His persistence won over local cadres, including one who burned a dossier of “black material” sent from Beijing to discredit Xi. The youth league admitted him in 1972 on his eighth attempt. It then took him ten tries before becoming a party member in January 1974, after which Liangjiahe residents elected him, still only twenty years old, as their party secretary.

Xi’s embrace of the party baffled some of his friends. Yi Xiaoxiong, a son of a former revolutionary persecuted by Red Guards, later told an American diplomat that he felt betrayed by Xi at the time. But Yi came to understand that Xi had chosen “to survive by becoming redder than the red,” according to a leaked U.S. diplomatic cable that summarized his remarks.63 In Xi’s own telling, he found inspiration in his belief that he and his father were honest and upright. “It was just a feeling that the more good people there were in the party and the youth league, the fewer bad people there would be,” he said.64

Xi was an enthusiastic village secretary. He led efforts to build dams, pave roads, and construct a methane tank to supply residents with gas for cooking and lighting.65 But he was also making plans to leave, having seen other rusticated youth drift back to the cities to fill vacancies in factories, schools, and the military. Xi had applied to Beijing’s esteemed Tsinghua University in 1973, but was rejected for being a “black gang child.” At the time, college-entrance examinations were suspended and universities admitted students through political screening. Administrators selected applicants for their class background and political rectitude, and those chosen were known as “worker-peasant-soldier” students, which became a pejorative epithet insinuating a lack of intellectual bona fides.

Xi reapplied two years later when Tsinghua allotted two places to youth in Yan’an. This time, he had glowing recommendations from local officials and enjoyed a stroke of luck. Tsinghua’s top two administrators, who were Mao loyalists, were absent when recruiters sought guidance on whether Xi could be admitted. The decision was left to a sympathetic deputy, who gave his approval after Xi Zhongxun sent a note saying his political problems shouldn’t affect his children’s education.66 Villagers waited outside Xi’s cave home to send him off the morning he left Liangjiahe in October 1975. The gesture moved Xi to tears, he recalled, only the second time that he cried during his years as a rusticated youth, the first being when he received a letter telling him his half sister Heping had died. That day about a dozen villagers walked with Xi to the county seat more than twelve miles away.

Seven years in Shaanxi hardened Xi. Friends say he gained an ability to relate to ordinary people and a desire to reclaim his family’s status. Official accounts depict Liangjiahe as a centerpiece in Xi’s political origin story, describing a transformative experience that ingrained in him a pragmatic can-do attitude and a sense of duty to the rural poor. In his own words, Xi said he came away determined to “do practical things for the people.”67 The village itself is now a popular “red tourism” destination for travelers keen on revolutionary history.





REHABILITATION


XI WAS AMONG NEARLY TWENTY-SEVEN HUNDRED students who enrolled at Tsinghua’s Beijing campus in the fall of 1975.68 The university had been a hotbed of fanaticism nearly a decade earlier, when students at the Tsinghua-affiliated middle school formed the first militant group to take the Red Guard name. A Tsinghua undergraduate, Kuai Dafu, emerged as a Red Guard leader who waged violent skirmishes against rival factions, including an infamous “hundred day war” on the Tsinghua campus in 1968.69

An uneasy calm had returned by the time Xi arrived as a worker-peasant-soldier student. He pursued a degree in organic chemistry, but university education at the time was more political than academic, marred by a lack of intellectual rigor and patchy teaching.70 One friend described Xi’s Tsinghua training as a degree in applied Marxism.71 Not that it mattered to Xi, who told another friend that he had no plans to work in the chemical industry. Xi, the friend recalled, “wanted to enter politics.”72

While many of his peers indulged in romance, alcohol, and movies, Xi focused on politics, overseeing propaganda work as a member of his class’s party committee.73 Friends recalled a budding politician who showed savviness beyond his years. One instance came in the wake of the “April 5 Movement” in 1976, when hundreds of thousands of people gathered at Beijing’s Tiananmen Square to eulogize Zhou Enlai, who had died three months earlier, and criticize Jiang Qing and other Cultural Revolution leaders later condemned as the “Gang of Four.” Security forces broke up the protests and hunted participants, some of whom had written and posted poetry on the square.

While Xi didn’t participate, he sympathized with fellow students who joined the demonstrations and distributed the Tiananmen poems, according to a Tsinghua classmate, Wu Xiju. Xi helped shield these students from investigations, but avoided advertising his own leanings one way or the other. When the university later urged students to write articles denouncing Deng Xiaoping, whom the Gang of Four accused of orchestrating the April 5 Movement, Wu asked Xi if he wanted to contribute. Xi declined, saying he wasn’t good at writing.74

Mao’s death in September 1976 triggered a chain of events that smoothed Xi’s path into politics. A bloodless coup soon toppled the Gang of Four. Deng, twice purged during the Cultural Revolution, maneuvered his way into power by ousting Mao’s designated successor, Hua Guofeng. Xi Zhongxun was another beneficiary, rehabilitated in early 1978 and given a top post in the southern province of Guangdong. For the first time in a decade and a half, Xi Jinping was free from the stigma of being a “black gang child.”

The elder Xi’s three years in Guangdong sealed his legacy as a pioneer in Deng’s “reform and opening up” program credited for spurring China’s economic miracle. As the provincial party chief, Xi helped persuade Beijing to grant Guangdong greater autonomy on economic affairs, paving the way for one of China’s first “special economic zones” and other policy experiments that would transform the province into a manufacturing hub and top exporter to foreign markets. His advocacy for market-style reforms was politically fraught at the time. Leftist conservatives who championed state planning remained a potent force within the party, and their opposition to China’s capitalist tilt would continue simmering for decades. Nonetheless Xi Zhongxun’s reputation as an economic reformer bequeathed a priceless political inheritance to his son, who could claim a personal connection to one of the party’s most successful and popular policies.

Xi Jinping tasted front-line politics while visiting his father in Guangdong in summer 1978, when he joined an inspection tour and observed his father’s interactions with local cadres and residents. As paramount leader, Xi would hearken back to that trip while highlighting his own contributions to China’s economic development.





MILITARY MAN


BY THE TIME XI JINPING graduated from Tsinghua in 1979, his father had secured him a job as an aide to Geng Biao, a vice premier and the newly appointed secretary-general of the Central Military Commission. An old revolutionary comrade of Xi Zhongxun, Geng had served as an ambassador, vice foreign minister, and chief of the party’s international liaison department before returning to a military role. He became defense minister in 1981.

A twenty-five-year-old Xi enlisted in the PLA to serve as one of Geng’s three secretaries. He put on a uniform, handled confidential documents, and attended meetings with Geng, a security-conscious boss who often barred Xi from taking notes and made him memorize sensitive information, including hundreds of telephone numbers. Under pressure not to mess up vital details, Xi sometimes secretly scribbled notes and stuffed them into his pockets.75 He also followed Geng on domestic inspection tours and overseas trips, his first time traveling abroad. During Geng’s 1979 European tour, Xi was joined by a young foreign ministry official by the name of Yang Jiechi, who later became China’s top diplomat, a Politburo member, and a foreign policy adviser to Xi.76

Access to top-level defense deliberations educated Xi on the intricacies of diplomacy and military strategy, as well as territorial issues, including Beijing’s sovereignty claims over the South China Sea and the self-ruled island of Taiwan. He would have witnessed Deng’s efforts to court PLA backing to consolidate his power, and seen how the aftermath of the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war, which ended in stalemate, spurred efforts to overhaul China’s obsolescent Soviet-style military. Xi also gleaned insights into U.S.-China relations. Beijing had only just normalized ties with Washington and wanted to develop bilateral military links as a counterweight against the Soviet Union. In 1980, Geng visited the U.S. to negotiate the purchase of American weaponry and came back with deep appreciation of the technological gap between the two militaries—an insight he relayed to colleagues and subordinates, including Xi.

Geng became a lifelong mentor for Xi. The two men often rode in Geng’s official Mercedes-Benz sedan and played Go to unwind. Geng believed that Go could develop a player’s ability to think strategically, and asked his aides to learn the game. Xi sought coaching help from his friend Nie Weiping, but the grandmaster declined, concerned that he would lose face if Xi played badly.77 Xi kept in touch with Geng after they stopped working together, continuing to address him as “chief” and visiting him almost every year until Geng’s death in 2000. Decades later, Xi would cite his fondness for the PLA as he pushed to modernize the military.

During his military stint, Xi married a daughter of China’s then ambassador to Britain. But the couple drifted apart and fought “almost every day,” according to Yi, the longtime friend, who was living directly across the hall from Xi in a Beijing housing compound at the time. Xi and his wife divorced when she left for England and he refused to go with her, Yi was quoted as telling an American diplomat in the leaked cable.78 Official biographies of Xi are silent on this marriage.





DOWN TO THE PROVINCES


XI JINPING SHED HIS UNIFORM after three years as a military aide, and threw himself into what would become a quarter century in local government. He told friends that leaving Beijing was a strategic choice, a way to learn new skills and gain valuable grassroots experience as China entered an era of economic development. One account described Xi’s decision as partly driven by PLA downsizing. Geng needed to lose one member of his staff, and Xi, the youngest and least experienced of his three secretaries, volunteered.79

Geng tried to dissuade him, telling Xi he could tour the grassroots within the military. Xi had every chance of rising to the PLA’s senior ranks, as some of his princeling peers would do. But his mind was set. In a conversation with Yi, Xi confided that going out into the provinces was his “only path to central power.”80 Staying put would leave Xi reliant on political networks that his father and Geng built, and curtail his own career potential in the long run, said Xi, who wanted to build his own power base.

Xi asked to be assigned a people’s commune, a now-defunct administrative unit equivalent to a township. But provincial officials placed him one tier higher. In March 1982, Xi became deputy party secretary of Zhengding, a poor agricultural county of about four hundred thousand people in Hebei province, located roughly 150 miles southwest from Beijing. An ancient religious center sprinkled with Buddhist temples and pagodas built as early as the sixth century, the county had faded into a backwater known for producing grain. Zhengding schooled Xi in the grueling and unglamorous work required of rural officials, who front some of the party’s most unpopular policies and suffer the scorn of residents who often see local cadres as brutish and venal functionaries. Xi later described the role of county official as one of the toughest and most important jobs in Chinese politics, tending to people’s most basic needs while juggling political, economic, and even cultural affairs.81

Some Zhengding residents greeted the twenty-eight-year-old bureaucrat from Beijing with disdain, regarding Xi as an elite outsider parachuted in to lord over the locals. “Here comes someone with no hair above his lips to boss us around,” muttered Jia Dashan, a popular local novelist and public servant, when Xi visited him for the first time.82 Xi presented himself as an approachable and earnest official, wearing old military uniforms to work and queueing for canteen meals with subordinates. While most county officials got around by car, Xi often rode his bicycle into the countryside. He said it helped him reach out to ordinary folk, save gasoline, and get some exercise. Jia was among those won over by Xi, who later nominated the novelist to become director of Zhengding’s culture bureau.

Promoted to county party chief in 1983, Xi tried leveraging Zhengding’s cultural heritage to earn tourism revenues. When he heard that state broadcaster China Central Television was producing an adaptation of the classic Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber, he persuaded the producers to shoot the series in Zhengding. He raised funds to help build a permanent Rongguo Mansion, the fictional home to one of two families featured in the novel, which was used for the production and retained as a tourist attraction.83 Xi also refurbished the county’s many Buddhist temples and pagodas as a way of attracting more tourist spending.84 His efforts dovetailed with a broader shift in religious policy—a part of Xi Zhongxun’s portfolio at the time—that urged a more tolerant approach to managing faith and encouraged officials to restore and repair places of worship.

In Zhengding, Xi also cemented ties with allies who would rise with him to the party leadership. He befriended Li Zhanshu, the party chief of a nearby county who became one of Xi’s closest confidants.85 Wang Qishan, who would run Xi’s anticorruption campaign decades later, was working at a central government office studying rural affairs at the time, and often hosted Xi and other local officials for policy discussions.86

Xi’s record caught the eye of the Central Organization Department, the party’s powerful personnel arm. Tasked in the early 1980s to revitalize the party’s aging and decimated bureaucracy, the department set up a Young Cadres Bureau to identify a “third echelon” of promising officials, who could be groomed to succeed the first two generations of party leaders. Opinions were split over the selection process. Some party elders supported a meritocratic approach while others insisted on favoring children of high-ranking officials, citing their presumed loyalty to the party. The latter attitude was captured in an oft-repeated but possibly apocryphal anecdote about how the revolutionary elder Chen Yun once said: “Letting our children take over means they wouldn’t dig up the ancestral graves.”87

Yan Huai, a section chief at the Young Cadres Bureau, encountered Xi while touring Hebei in 1983 to assess third echelon candidates. Local bureaucrats told Yan that Xi was a hardworking and conscientious official with no airs, though some veteran cadres called him a privileged upstart who often proposed fancy, even impractical, ideas. Yan, himself a son of a revolutionary and fellow Tsinghua alumnus, gave Xi a positive appraisal. The following year, Xi was selected as one of Hebei’s one thousand third echelon cadres, setting him up for a fast-tracked career.88

Xi Zhongxun lobbied on his son’s behalf as well, asking Hebei party chief Gao Yang to look after Xi Jinping. But the intervention irked Gao, who in internal meetings raised concerns about the elder Xi’s actions, according to recollections by Yan and his mentor Li Rui, a former Mao aide who served as the Central Organization Department’s deputy chief around that time. Gao’s revelations made it untenable for Xi Jinping to remain in Hebei, so the elder Xi sought help from an old friend, Xiang Nan, then party boss in the coastal province of Fujian and a prominent advocate of pro-market reforms.89 The younger Xi gained a new mentor in Xiang and a transfer to Fujian’s port city of Xiamen, where he was to become director of the municipal tourism bureau. The posting got better before he arrived. A Xiamen vice mayor stepped aside citing health reasons, and Xi was assigned to fill the vacancy.90

Xi has been circumspect about his father’s role in his career. “It can’t be said that there’s absolutely no connection, but it also can’t be said that I’m someone who lives off his father,” he told a Hong Kong newspaper in 1989. “Frankly speaking, currently we still haven’t set up a comprehensive cadre-selection system, and it’s easy for leaders to promote and use people who are close and familiar to them.”91 As Xi reminded his interviewer, he first became a village official while his father was still politically disgraced. “This was a level playing field,” he said. “There was no backdoor to use.”





FUJIAN YEARS


XI ARRIVED IN XIAMEN on his thirty-second birthday, kicking off what would become a seventeen-year tour of Fujian. There he built his résumé as a local administrator and honed his craft as a glad-handing politician.

A culturally diverse region with a rich history of maritime trade on China’s southeastern coast, Fujian exposed Xi to economic, social, and military affairs far removed from his experiences in the northern countryside. He sought ways to entice foreign capital and promote export industries, while fighting poverty and building up an economically laggard region. He encountered Fujian’s cultural connections with the Chinese diaspora, particularly in Southeast Asia, where many Fujianese migrants had settled over past centuries. Xi also gained a familiarity with Taiwan, separated from Fujian by a strait roughly 110 miles wide, and a source of much-needed investment for Fujian, which Beijing had long regarded as a military frontier.

By most accounts, Xi’s Fujian record was unremarkable. He earned a reputation as a conscientious official and acquainted himself with an influential superior who later joined the party’s top leadership. But Xi’s stint also coincided with sluggish growth, white elephant projects, and major corruption scandals. Willy Lam, a Hong Kong–based analyst of Chinese politics, described the period as “seventeen lackadaisical years in Fujian,” during which Xi’s performance “could not be called meteoric nor did he leave behind any major achievements.”92

In Xiamen, where Xi served three years as vice mayor, he got his first taste of “reform and opening up” at one of its freewheeling urban front lines, brimming with fast-growing factories, commercial buzz, and the seedy side effects of fast money. He would also witness firsthand the bitter ideological feuding within the party. In June 1985, around the time Xi arrived in the port city, the People’s Daily published a scathing report about a fake medicine scandal in a Fujian county, kicking off a state media offensive that blamed negligence by provincial authorities and the unbridled development of private enterprises. The real target was Xiang, the Fujian party chief, whose pro-business policies had irked conservative elders in Beijing. Despite interventions by his allies, including Xi Zhongxun, the scandal forced Xiang to step down from front-line politics in February 1986.

Party conservatives claimed another scalp in January 1987, unseating the liberal-minded Hu Yaobang as general secretary for allegedly mishandling student protests and economic reforms. Some insiders say Xi Zhongxun spoke fierily in Hu’s defense at a high-level meeting, though historian Joseph Torigian has cited evidence suggesting that this outburst didn’t happen. And while the elder Xi was upset with his friend’s ouster, he later voiced support for the decision—likely to protect himself. Either way, the purges of Xiang and Hu would have reinforced somber lessons for Xi Jinping: lying low and biding time were the safest ways to navigate party intrigue.

Those lessons were put to the test in late 1987, when a group of municipal lawmakers nominated Xi for Xiamen mayor. The gesture reflected Xi’s popularity among the local elite but pitted him against the incumbent, who was seeking a second term as the party’s preferred candidate. Xi knew better than to defy his superiors. He told them he would withdraw from the mayoral contest and support the party’s choice, according to a senior Fujian official at the time.93 Xi remained vice mayor until he left Xiamen the following year.

Xi’s Xiamen stint was perhaps best known for its impact on his personal life. He befriended He Lifeng, a local bureaucrat who would become one of Xi’s most trusted allies and a top economic official in his administration. In late 1986, friends introduced Xi to Peng Liyuan, a popular PLA folk singer nine years his junior and, at that point, far more famous than he was. At their first meeting, Peng wore military pants to test how much her date valued a woman’s appearances. Xi also came modestly attired, and his first questions to Peng, she recalled, weren’t the usual quizzing about her latest hits or the fees she earned, but an almost academic question about the number of ways to perform vocal music. “I’m very sorry, I watch very little television. What songs have you sung?” Xi asked. Peng named “In the Fields of Hope,” a 1981 tune that had become one of her signature songs. “Oh,” Xi said, “I’ve heard this song before, it’s quite nice.”94

They married in September 1987 with little fanfare, celebrating with Xi’s colleagues at a hastily arranged dinner. One attendee was surprised to see Peng, only finding out then that she was the bride.95 Xi later told Peng: “Having met you for less than 40 minutes, I had already decided that you’ll be my wife.” The couple spent long spells apart. Peng continued her singing career in Beijing, while Xi stayed in Fujian. He missed the birth of their daughter and only child, Mingze, in 1992 as he was busy directing typhoon relief operations.96

Marrying Peng reinforced Xi’s military connections and added a dash of glamor to his staid image. As Xi’s national profile grew in the 2000s, Peng became a vocal advocate for her husband, lauding him in interviews as a loving spouse and doting father. She took on a limited role in politics, becoming a member of a government advisory body and a goodwill ambassador for HIV/AIDS prevention. Within elite circles, she often presented herself as a face of the family, even speaking on her husband’s behalf in private engagements.97 The couple emulated many of their peers in the party elite by sending their daughter to attend college in the United States. Mingze studied at Harvard under an assumed name in the early 2010s, her true identity known only to a small number of faculty. She has kept a low profile since returning to China and rarely appears in public.

In 1988, Xi returned to the countryside as party chief of Ningde, a mountainous rural district of about 2.7 million people in eastern Fujian. Mired in poverty with few natural resources, the area had dim prospects that soured further as Beijing imposed austerity measures to combat inflation across the country. Xi’s first challenge was tempering expectations. When he arrived, a veteran cadre introduced him to residents as a high-ranking official’s son, who would “definitely go to the central government to get a few big projects” for Ningde, he recalled in a 1989 interview. The gesture appalled Xi, who later told local officials he had never gone to Beijing to solicit projects and wouldn’t be able to secure any even if he did.98 Xi directed efforts to fight rural poverty—one of his future priorities as paramount leader—and made a show of touring the countryside, even picking up a hoe to work the fields with farmers. He resettled thousands of fisherfolk from dilapidated junks into new housing on land. He also turned to what would become a signature theme of his leadership decades later: crushing corruption.

At the time, widespread malfeasance plagued Ningde, where many officials misappropriated land to build homes for themselves.99 Xi ordered an anti-graft clampdown that uncovered wrongdoing by nearly 7,400 cadres, drawing attention from higher-ups and scoring national headlines. In May 1990, the People’s Daily published a report titled “Doing One Thing Well and Winning Ten Thousand Hearts,” praising Ningde as a shining example of how decisive leadership overcame a vexing problem and won over skeptical residents.100

The crackdown proved well timed, coming amid rising resentment over inflation and corruption kicked up by Deng’s economic reforms. During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, which inspired similar demonstrations across China, including in Fujian, Xi treaded a careful line between mollifying public wrath and defending the party. Addressing local officials in May 1989, just as the protest movement climaxed, Xi acknowledged the anger over government graft but warned against what he called misguided solutions like unfettered democracy. He cited the Cultural Revolution as an example where democratic passions, mixed with superstition and stupidity, wreaked havoc. “Can these days be allowed to repeat?” he said. “Without stability and unity, nothing else matters!”101

It isn’t clear what Xi thought of the bloodletting that ended the protests. Some party insiders said that Xi Zhongxun, then a senior legislative official, privately opposed the use of force and was sidelined again as a result, though historians haven’t found any evidence suggesting that he took active steps to prevent the crackdown. Either way, the elder Xi soon retired, spending most of his final years in Shenzhen before passing away in a Beijing hospital in 2002, aged eighty-eight.

Xi Jinping remained a filial son throughout, showing profound respect for his father’s character and legacy. When the patriarch celebrated his eighty-eighth birthday in 2001, the younger Xi was too busy to attend and wrote him a letter instead. “From the time people on the streets called us ‘sons of bitches,’ I’ve already firmly believed that my father is a big hero and a father most deserving of our pride,” the son wrote. “Father has unwavering faith in Communism and believes that our party is great, glorious, and correct; your words and deeds have shown us the right way forward.”102

In 1990, Xi earned a call-up to the provincial capital of Fuzhou, where he would stay for twelve years, first as the municipal party boss, before rising to Fujian governor, the provincial number two. As before, Xi tried to make a quick impression, going on a grassroots tour within days of his arrival and ingratiating himself with superiors and foreign diplomats.103 He demanded urgency from his subordinates, telling them to work with a spirit of mashang jiuban, or “do it right away”—a slogan still displayed at Fuzhou’s party headquarters today.104 In early 1991, Xi’s administration proposed building a large airport to serve Fuzhou, arguing that a shortage of air-transport links was impairing the city’s growth. The Changle Airport project received speedy approval and construction commenced in 1993.

Following Deng Xiaoping’s 1992 “southern tour,” aimed at reviving economic reforms that had stalled in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, Xi embraced the message, traveling to places like British Hong Kong, Singapore, and the U.S. to solicit investments and commercial tie-ups. He courted ethnic Chinese entrepreneurs in Taiwan and Southeast Asia, touting Fujian’s low labor costs and appealing to a sense of kinship among those with ancestral roots in the province. Xi scored a coup by bringing in Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing to redevelop Fuzhou’s historic Sanfang Qixiang, or “Three Lanes, Seven Alleys,” into a lavish residential and commercial zone, a deal celebrated with a grand groundbreaking ceremony that Xi hosted for Li in 1993.

Some of these “prestige projects” would later be tarred by controversy. Fuzhou’s Changle Airport fell far short of usage projections after it opened in 1997, suffering hefty losses and taking on heavy debt. A government audit blamed “unscientific” policy-making and poor management, and the airport underwent restructuring before turning its first annual profit in 2005.105 Municipal authorities suspended and overhauled the Sanfang Qixiang development in the mid-2000s due to delays and public outrage over the razing of historical buildings.106 The magnitude of these problems only became clear after Xi left his role as Fuzhou party chief in 1996 and the negative press left him unscathed. After Xi took power as paramount leader, state media rehabilitated both projects as examples of far-sighted leadership.

Military affairs proved more profitable for Xi’s résumé building. He often held concurrent military roles across his Fujian posts, including first political commissar of a reserve anti-aircraft artillery division, familiarizing him with PLA operations during a period of heightened tensions between Beijing and Taipei. In public writings, he echoed the party leadership in denouncing Taiwan’s then president for allegedly trying to “split the motherland,” and urged efforts to strengthen China’s military.107 He spared little expense backing the troops, apportioning funds to upgrade equipment and facilities, supplement stipends, and even help demobilized servicemen find new work. “There are no small matters in the military,” he would say whenever a subordinate asked about troop-related expenses. “To meet the army’s needs, nothing is excessive.”108 Beijing named Xi a model supporter of the armed forces—a reputation that he would replicate as paramount leader.

Local officials and journalists, however, saw Xi as a cautious and somewhat nondescript administrator, one who preferred working by the book and avoiding decisions that could backfire later. “Xi was a real goody-goody who spent a lot of time cultivating relationships with the military and party elders,” hosting meals and visiting them during the Lunar New Year holidays, said Alfred Wu, a politics professor who met Xi on several occasions while working as a newspaper reporter in Fuzhou during the 2000s. “Back then he was rather bland and passive—even if he had the authority to do something, he often didn’t use it.”109 When a government adviser suggested using tax rebates to boost certain local industries, Xi said he would consider the idea but never followed up on it, Wu recalled. The proposal faded away.

Xi won promotion to Fujian deputy party chief in 1995, setting up a shot at national politics two years later at the fifteenth party congress, where he joined the 344-strong Central Committee as a nonvoting alternate member. The appointment gave him access to key decision-making circles, but the manner of his entry was a source of embarrassment, coming dead last among the 151 alternates chosen in an internal poll. Given that party congresses had consistently yielded an even number of alternate Central Committee members since the 1970s, rumors swirled that influential patrons had shoehorned Xi into the committee by fiat.

Some observers blamed Xi’s poor showing on anti-nepotism impulses within the party, as other princelings also received tepid support.110 The party’s embrace of technocratic leadership after Mao had fueled the rise of engineers-turned-administrators like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, who both hailed from relatively humble backgrounds and built careers around their training in hard science. Regardless, the 1997 party congress was more boon than bane for Xi. He gained a foothold in the Beijing beltway, where he could cultivate more patrons. One of his former bosses, Jia Qinglin, who was Fujian’s party chief from 1993 to 1996, joined the elite Politburo.

Such connections likely proved vital when Xi confronted his biggest crisis in Fujian, a massive smuggling and corruption scandal that implicated officials across all levels of government. The sordid affair erupted in 1999, when investigators from Beijing unearthed a criminal conspiracy led by Lai Changxing, a Fujianese farmer turned swaggering entrepreneur, whose Xiamen-based Yuanhua Group had been smuggling billions of dollars’ worth of oil, cars, cigarettes, and appliances into China since the mid-1990s with help from military and police units. Authorities arrested hundreds of officials and businessmen, and executed more than a dozen people. Lai, who fled to Canada, is now serving a life sentence after being deported back to China in 2011 on Beijing’s promise that he would not be executed.

Xi, who stepped up as Fujian governor while the scandal unfolded, was tasked with managing the political cleanup. He steered clear of controversy even as former colleagues were detained, and proved his worth to patrons. When rumors swirled that Jia Qinglin’s wife was implicated in the Yuanhua case, Xi issued a firm denial in a newspaper interview—remarks that would have pleased Jia, a close associate of the incumbent paramount leader, Jiang Zemin.111

For Xi’s detractors, such gestures exposed his commitment to clean government as far from absolute. They felt his incorruptible image masked a willingness to ignore misconduct when it might be politically expedient. Some of Xi’s subordinates were purged over their alleged roles in the Yuanhua scandal, as well as organized-crime cases that surfaced after Xi left Fujian, including one involving Fuzhou crime boss Chen Kai, who was sentenced to death in 2005 for running brothels and gambling dens in collusion with some fifty officials. The cases didn’t implicate Xi, but he conceded to making some poor personnel choices.112

At this point, Xi appeared tolerant of his relatives’ dabblings in business, a common practice across elite party families, even though Xi reportedly told relatives and friends to neither engage in commercial activities in places where he worked nor use his name for leverage.113 In a 2012 report, Bloomberg News revealed that members of Xi’s extended family had been accruing significant wealth since the 1990s, collectively holding more than $50 million worth of property as well as lucrative investments in a range of companies that collectively possessed more than $2 billion in assets.114 Some of Xi’s cousins also went into business in Shenzhen and Hong Kong in the 1980s and 1990s, according to a biography of Xi’s maternal uncle.115

There was no evidence that Xi did anything to advance his relatives’ business interests at any point in his career. Bloomberg’s 2012 report didn’t trace any assets to Xi himself, or his wife and daughter. Within the party and business elite, stories have circulated about how Qi Xin, not long before Xi took power, told her other children to dial back their business activities to avoid causing problems for the leader-in-waiting. One well-connected businessman told me that Xi often instructed subordinates not to get involved in any commercial dealings with his siblings, particularly his elder sister Qi Qiaoqiao, who went into business after serving in China’s paramilitary police and—along with her second husband—accumulated assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars.116 After Xi took office, authorities even detained one of his maternal cousins in 2014 for alleged criminal wrongdoing, according to the cousin’s associates.117

In Xi’s own words, as well as the words of those who knew him, his ambitions led him not to wealth, but to power. Yi Xiaoxiong, the former friend, told an American diplomat that Xi doesn’t care about money. Xi, rather, is “repulsed by the all-encompassing commercialization of Chinese society, with its attendant nouveau riche, official corruption, loss of values, dignity, and self-respect,” according to Yi, who predicted that Xi would tackle these evils once he became leader.118 “Going into politics means one cannot dream of getting rich,” Xi said in a 2000 interview.119

By the early 2000s, Xi had acquired a breadth of experience that was rare among officials of his rank and age. He even secured a PhD in law from Tsinghua with a thesis on agricultural policy that many believe to be ghostwritten, joining the ranks of high-flying officials who padded their credentials with advanced degrees.120 Chinese politics watchers and Hong Kong media were already identifying Xi as a potential leader. Unlike the ostentatious Bo Xilai, a fellow princeling and regional leader with eyes on high office, Xi avoided indulging such speculation. At a 2002 news conference, a reporter asked Xi if he was one of China’s new generation of leaders to watch. His eyes widened and his face flushed. “I nearly spilt water all down my shirt,” he said. “You trying to give me a fright?”121





BUSINESS AS USUAL


WHEN XI TOOK CHARGE in the coastal province of Zhejiang in late 2002, the party was in the midst of an unlikely makeover—welcoming once-reviled capitalists into its proletarian ranks. After two decades of economic reforms, China’s entrepreneurial classes had superseded state enterprises in driving growth and demanded more say over policies, while middle-class Chinese were shedding their deference to party authority. General Secretary Jiang Zemin responded with a new doctrine, the “Three Represents,” to make the party more responsive to a more dynamic and pluralistic society. The party, Jiang said, must represent people of all social classes and the needs of “advanced productive forces”—i.e., private entrepreneurs—if it were to stay relevant and in power.

Zhejiang was a pacesetter in the party’s embrace of private business. Adjacent to glitzy Shanghai, the affluent region of more than 46 million people was known for its hardscrabble entrepreneurs and a growing bevy of ambitious companies, from the automaker Geely to Jack Ma’s internet startup Alibaba. For Xi, his stint as Zhejiang party boss was also an audition for the nation’s highest offices, with an implicit mandate to ensure that the province catch or even outpace the national economy, by then the fastest growing among major countries.

Xi abided by the party’s prevailing wisdoms on development, doling out business-friendly policies and encouraging local firms to seek new markets. He traveled abroad to drum up investment and greased the wheels for foreign businesses, helping American companies like Citibank, FedEx, McDonald’s, and Motorola set up or expand operations in Zhejiang.122 In a prelude to his future campaigns to promote higher-end and sustainable industry, Xi blacklisted “backward” manufacturing sectors, which were made to either upgrade their technology or leave the province. His efforts reaped ample rewards in an era when economic indicators defined an official’s worth. During Xi’s tenure, Zhejiang reported solid double-digit growth each year, while the annual value of its exports more than tripled, surpassing $100 billion in 2006.

Privately, though, some Chinese observers scoffed at Xi’s achievements, saying he benefited from a favorable business climate and only needed “not to mess things up.”123 As it was in Fujian, some problems that critics blamed on Xi only surfaced after he moved on. The risky private-lending markets that underpinned a thriving entrepreneurial scene in the Zhejiang city of Wenzhou unraveled in 2011, forcing thousands of small businesses to fold and driving desperate entrepreneurs to skip town or even commit suicide.124

Politically, Xi maintained an unobstrusive mien. Li Rui, the former Mao aide and a friend of Xi Zhongxun, recalled having a meal with the younger Xi while visiting Zhejiang during the future leader’s stint there. “Now your position is different,” Li told Xi, “you can offer some opinions to the higher-ups.” But Xi demurred, suggesting that Li, as a respected revolutionary elder, could get away with saying things that incumbent officials could not. “How can I be compared to you?” Xi replied. “You can play on the edges and test the limits. I wouldn’t dare.”125

Xi kept up his schmoozing with party bigwigs and foreign dignitaries, as would any official on the cusp of promotion. He charmed the U.S. ambassador over dinner with his keen grasp of economic data and fondness for Hollywood movies about World War II, and plied his superiors with alcohol in the kind of extravagance that he would suppress after taking power.126 On one occasion in 2004, as he recounted later to liquor executives, Xi hosted former party chief Jiang Zemin and his wife with a bottle of eighty-year-old Moutai liquor—a scarce and lavish treat worth at least tens of thousands of yuan at the time.127 That same year, the company that produces Moutai, a fiery baijiu spirit made from red sorghum, donated a bottle of the same vintage to the permanent collection at a museum in Zhejiang’s capital of Hangzhou.128

Jiang’s support was essential for Xi. Having a powerful patron could prove decisive in his bid to become China’s “fifth generation” leader, a choice to be finalized through painstaking deliberations within the party elite. By the mid-2000s, the field had narrowed to two main contenders: Xi and Li Keqiang, a provincial party boss two years his junior. Each man enjoyed backing from one of two broad camps within the party, respectively comprising officials sharing similar backgrounds, ideological leanings, and political interests.129

Many fellow princelings favored Xi. They believed the party must be led by born-red officials who would never renounce their revolutionary lineage, as opposed to apparatchiks of humble stock—such as Mikhail Gorbachev—who might one day betray the party. Xi’s military background helped him build ties with the politically influential PLA. His pedigree as the son of a prominent economic reformer, as well as his own business-friendly record in Fujian and Zhejiang, convinced some private entrepreneurs that Xi was their man.

Li represented a more meritocratic path. The son of a low-level official, he began his party career in a rural farming unit before earning a place at the prestigious Peking University through competitive entrance exams when they resumed in 1977. Li headed the student council and graduated with a law degree before joining the Communist Youth League, where he worked with Hu Jintao while the latter led the league in the mid-1980s. After a decade and a half with the league, Li took senior posts in two impoverished provinces, first Henan in central China and then Liaoning in the northeast, though his performances were seen as patchy, marred by the perceived mishandling of mass-fatality fires and an HIV/AIDS epidemic caused by blood-selling rackets.

Some insiders say Li was the preferred successor for Hu and other senior officials with a Youth League background, collectively known as tuanpai, or “league faction,” though the name suggests greater cohesion among its perceived members than may be warranted. A fluent English speaker with a master’s degree and PhD in economics, Li boasted genuine intellectual chops, unlike Xi, whose academic credentials were less solid. Li’s vocal support of Hu’s policies, including efforts to reduce wealth gaps and create social safety nets, marked him as a leading figure in what some observers called the party’s “populist” coalition.130

But some party elders eyed Li with suspicion. His undergraduate years in Peking University overlapped with the “Democracy Wall” movement that spanned the winter of 1978 and the following spring, when students put up posters expressing hopes for democratic reforms. Many hongerdai derided Li and other officials with non-elite backgrounds as “shopkeepers’ sons,” unworthy of governing the nation that their revolutionary ancestors had fought for.

Both Xi and Li were expected to win seats on the Politburo Standing Committee at the 2007 party congress. The question was who would outrank the other and claim pole position in the succession race. Whatever Xi thought of his chances, he kept it to himself. In January 2007, when a reporter asked him to rate his own performance, he responded with artful prevarication. “How can I grade myself?” Xi said. “If I gave a high score, others would say I’m boastful; if I gave a low score, others would say I lack self-esteem.”131





SHANGHAI SOJOURN


XI’S LAST REGIONAL JOB came unexpectedly. Shanghai party boss Chen Liangyu was dismissed in September 2006 for corruption, becoming the first sitting Politburo member to be sacked in over a decade.132 A prominent figure in Jiang Zemin’s “Shanghai Gang” of loyalists, Chen later received an eighteen-year jail sentence for crimes that included shady financial dealings and misusing money from the city’s pension fund for vanity real-estate projects. Within political circles, the common wisdom was that Chen had picked too many fights with Beijing in exerting Shanghai’s autonomy, handing Hu Jintao an opening to strike at Jiang’s camp.

Choosing Chen’s full-time replacement was a weighty decision. Shanghai’s party secretaries have customarily occupied a Politburo seat and gone on to join its Standing Committee since Jiang did so in the late 1980s. The pool of candidates was therefore limited to those worthy of promotion to senior ranks, if they weren’t already there. With just months to go before the party congress, a Shanghai assignment would signal an advantage for Xi or Li.

Fortune favored Xi again. Announcing the transfer in March 2007, the party’s personnel chief praised the new Shanghai party boss as someone who is “fair and upright, good at uniting people, and holds himself to strict standards.”133 Xi himself told Shanghai cadres that he “had no mental preparation whatsoever” for the transfer, but pledged to shore up public confidence and tackle corruption.134 Six days after his appointment, Xi made his first public appearance since the transfer with a pilgrimage to the party’s roots—a brick house in Shanghai’s French Concession where Mao and a dozen others had convened the party’s founding congress in 1921. It was canny stagecraft, given his mandate to smooth over the scandal and rally the city’s shaken bureaucracy.135 The visit was a way to “commemorate the party’s great achievements and learn from the lofty spirit of our revolutionary forebears,” Xi said. “We must wield power impartially, maintain integrity and self-discipline, and consciously resist the corrosiveness of corrupt and backward thinking.”136

Xi spent the next seven months identifying trusted aides he could bring to Beijing, while filling his schedule with safe engagements. Among those granted audiences were foreign dignitaries like Henry Kissinger and former Japanese prime minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, as well as business delegations who hadn’t imagined that Xi would agree to meet.137 Kerry Brown, a former British diplomat turned researcher who attended one such delegation meeting, recalled that “this was so unusual that the junior official charged with looking after us was unable to conceal his amazement that a group as relatively unimportant as ours was to be granted golden moments with someone who was expected, very soon, to become one of the most powerful people in the world.”138

The party elite coalesced around Xi as their preferred leader-in-waiting in June, when more than four hundred senior officials gathered at the Central Party School to nominate a new Politburo. In an innovation that officials hailed as a showcase of “intra-party democracy,” attendees received ballot slips and picked from a list of nearly two hundred candidates.139 Xi performed well in this “straw poll,” a result that sealed his advantage over Li, according to party insiders and official accounts.140 Though Xi rose to power through this quasi-democratic mechanism, he would dismantle it after taking office, reverting to backroom consultations with party grandees to fill top posts.141

Contemporary accounts credited Jiang for engineering Xi’s victory, with help from princelings eager to see one of their own reclaim power from Hu’s coterie of commoners. Xi was a compromise choice, less objectionable to broader sections of the party than his rivals. There were also more practical reasons for favoring Xi, who offered a common, populist touch that the party needed but Hu lacked.142

The final vote in October 2007 was a formality. When the party’s new nine-man ruling council filed onto a dais in the Great Hall of the People to meet the press, emerging in order of seniority, Xi appeared sixth in line, just ahead of Li.143 China learned who their next leader was likely to be, but for many, he was just a name. “Who’s Xi Jinping?” began a popular joke at the time. “Ah, he’s Peng Liyuan’s husband.”





CROWN PRINCELING


THE ROLE OF HEIR APPARENT has been fraught with peril, across cultures and throughout history. Imperial China saw its share of crown princes waylaid or killed before claiming the throne, and the People’s Republic had fared little better, with Mao and Deng each deposing would-be successors. Though Xi was priming himself for power, any mistake or misfortune could have derailed his ascension.

Xi had much to learn in his five years as Hu’s understudy. He experienced firsthand the awesome responsibilities in helming the ship of state, grappling with ethnic tensions and social unrest kicked up by rapid but haphazard growth. Abroad, he confronted outbursts of anti-China sentiment, a stunning implosion of Western finance, and the social media–fueled uprisings of the Arab Spring that rumbled through the Middle East from late 2010 to 2012. As a member of the top leadership responsible for party cohesion, he helped shape Beijing’s responses to these challenges, while preparing his own strategies for reinforcing authoritarian rule.

Xi’s first major task was to lead a party committee supervising final preparations for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. It was a tricky test ensuring that China’s grandiose “coming-out party” succeed, a soft-power extravaganza that cost $42 billion in new stadia and infrastructure, a facelift for the capital city, and a laborious effort to clean up smoggy skies by shutting and relocating factories, restricting road traffic, and planting millions of trees. Despite meticulous planning, the run-up to the games could hardly have gone worse. Bloody riots broke out in Tibet in March 2008, exposing pent-up anger among its majority Buddhist population against the party’s heavy-handed rule. Two months later, a massive earthquake devastated the southwestern province of Sichuan, killing more than eighty thousand people, including countless children crushed by the collapse of shoddily built schools.

Authorities contained the domestic fallout with censorship and propaganda, including gushy reports of Xi’s wife and daughter taking part in relief efforts. But they proved less adept at selling Beijing’s messaging abroad. Rights activists denounced what they called the “Genocide Olympics” to pressure Beijing over its alleged role in abetting the Darfur conflict with arms shipments to Sudan.144 Even the torch relay, envisioned as a global public relations exercise, was overshadowed by large anti-China demonstrations along the route in Western Europe and North America, where protesters criticized the party’s human rights record and voiced support for Tibetan independence.

Fortunately for Xi, the games proceeded smoothly. No serious security incidents occurred and the dreaded smog stayed away, though media revelations of fakery marred the opening ceremony, where a photogenic girl lip-synched in place of the actual singer, who had crooked teeth. When a Chinese track star’s injury-forced withdrawal plunged the nation into grief, Xi offered a consolatory message to the athlete—a rare gesture from a senior leader.145 China topped the medal table for the first time, handing the party a propaganda coup.

The Olympic legacy was far less rosy for China on the global stage. Its image-building fell flat among Western countries, whose lecturing on human rights rankled Chinese officials even more as the global financial crisis exposed what Beijing saw as fundamental flaws in liberal democracies. “There are some foreigners who’ve nothing better to do after eating their fill, pointing fingers at our affairs,” Xi said while visiting Mexico as vice president in February 2009. “China, first of all, doesn’t export revolution; second, we don’t export hunger and poverty; and third, we don’t cause trouble for you. What else is there to say?”146 It was an early taste of the nationalistic straight talk that Xi would deliver as paramount leader, jarring to foreign ears but refreshingly forthright to Chinese audiences. Social media users cheered his candor and compared it favorably against Hu Jintao’s corseted demeanor.147 Censors soon scrubbed the footage from the Chinese internet.148

Within China, social foment fueled by labor disputes, land grabs, environmental degradation, and other inequities dominated the party’s domestic agenda. Despite Hu’s calls to create a “harmonious society,” Chinese researchers estimated that the annual volume of “mass incidents”—the official euphemism for protests, strikes, and other forms of unrest—had swelled to some 180,000 by 2010, from about 87,000 incidents in 2005, and roughly 10,000 incidents in the early 1990s. The most explosive of these erupted in the northwestern frontier region of Xinjiang, home to millions of Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority, many of whom resented the growing Han Chinese influence over their culture and economy. In July 2009, just weeks after Xi toured Xinjiang, bloody riots erupted in the regional capital of Urumqi between Uyghurs and Han Chinese, leaving about two hundred dead and more than seventeen hundred others injured.149 Political turmoil abroad, particularly the Arab Spring, added to the party’s unease.

Hu’s administration took a hardline approach to weiwen, or “maintaining stability,” which became a mantra for officials whose career advancement rested on their ability to keep the peace and deliver growth. China’s planned spending on public security surpassed the defense budget for the first time in 2011 as the government ramped up funding for law enforcement, domestic intelligence, and judicial agencies.150 Annual internal security expenditure would more than double over the course of Hu’s second five-year term, topping 710 billion yuan—the equivalent of roughly $112 billion at the time—in 2012. Internet regulators exerted greater control over social media, particularly after a deadly high-speed train crash sparked an outpouring of anger and emotion on Chinese social media that overwhelmed government censors.151

Xi grasped the exigencies of weiwen. As president of the Central Party School, the elite training academy in Beijing, he ordered more than two thousand county chiefs to attend weeklong training courses in late 2008, with classes focused on how to handle emergencies and maintain social stability.152 Party cadres must “strengthen their decisiveness in maintaining stability, resolve disputes in a timely manner, and handle mass incidents appropriately,” Xi told officials at the Central Party School in March 2009.153

When then U.S. vice president Joe Biden visited China in 2011, Xi spoke with him at length about the Soviet collapse and how Ba’athist and other authoritarian leaders in the Middle East and North Africa were facing a similar fate. Xi characterized these events as “an object lesson to the CCP—it meant the party cannot get out of touch with the people, the party cannot allow unfettered corruption to rage,” said Daniel Russel, a senior Obama administration official who attended dozens of meetings with Xi before and after he took power.154 The leader-in-waiting also explained how the party must overcome infighting and excessive autonomy among officials acting like they run local fiefs. “Xi Jinping talked at length about how China’s natural state is entropy, that there are forces of division and separatism within the country and also external forces trying to break it apart,” Russel recalled. “He was quite straightforward about how China needs a strong, single point of leadership—and that is the Chinese Communist Party—and that the party needs a strong, single point of leadership as well.”155

Biden offered a similar assessment years later, describing Xi as “a very smart and calculating guy” who “doesn’t have a democratic—with a small ‘d’—bone in his body.” Through their conversations, Biden came to believe that Xi “doesn’t think that democracies can be sustained in the 21st century,” an era so fast-changing that “only autocracies are able to handle it,” he said. “Because democracies require consensus, and it takes too much time, too much effort to get it together.”156

Xi’s views were a widely shared indictment of China’s leadership under Hu and Premier Wen Jiabao, both technocrats of humble upbringing seen as competent caretakers incapable of bold action. With decision-making powers shared among officials with competing ideas and interests, the result was often policy gridlock and tepid reforms that failed to mitigate the side effects of breakneck growth. Many Chinese felt left behind even as their economy swelled into the world’s second largest. Wealth gaps widened, corruption festered, pollution worsened, and consumer-safety scares increased. Some scholars called the Hu-Wen years a “lost decade,” arguing that the party failed to deliver the political overhauls that China needed to cope with slowing growth and avoid economic stagnation.157

Within the party, discordant voices battled over what should be done. A 2008 report published by Central Party School researchers urged the leadership to pursue limited democratic reforms, warning that China risked falling into grave instability unless the party submitted to legal checks on its powers, eased censorship, tolerated a freer press, and allowed some competitive elections.158 Some public intellectuals spoke boldly of the need for “constitutionalism,” calling for legal checks and balances and separation of powers similar to liberal democracies. Many princelings, though, believed it was time for one of their own to reclaim power from the commoners. “Princelings regard the likes of Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao as ‘butlers’ and ‘shopkeepers’ who merely help them look after the business,” said Cai Xia, a former Central Party School professor who socialized in princeling circles and is herself a granddaughter of a revolutionary. “In their minds, princelings believe that ‘all under heaven are ours to rule; if we don’t do it, who will?’ ”159

Questions remained on whether Xi was the right man for the job. His lack of a power base, some analysts argued, would leave him vulnerable to meddling by Jiang Zemin and Hu, whose protégés could outflank Xi in the decision-making process. Party infighting could intensify, depending on how key positions were apportioned between the standard bearers of rival coalitions, ideological camps, and interest groups. The corruption and bureaucratic inertia that hobbled Hu would remain formidable challenges for his successor. One veteran Japanese journalist even published in early 2012 a book titled Xi Jinping: Communist China’s Weakest Emperor.160

Whether by chance or scheming, the final lead-up to the succession in 2012 proved propitious for Xi. Potential challengers crashed out in corruption and murder scandals, tarring the party’s image but also boosting officials, like Xi, who sought a root-and-branch overhaul of China’s blighted bureaucracy. After months of horse-trading, the party elite agreed on a largely conservative lineup for Xi’s leadership bench, easing liberal-minded contenders into less important roles, and giving the next general secretary a firm mandate to clean house.

The most dramatic downfall belonged to Bo Xilai, a princeling and regional chief gunning for a seat in the top leadership. Born in July 1949, Bo was the fourth of seven children fathered by Bo Yibo, a revolutionary hero exalted as one of the party’s “eight great elders” who held sway in the post-Mao era. The younger Bo brimmed with ambition, charisma, and good looks. Throughout his career he had displayed a flair for publicity more familiar to Western politicians, as well as a single-minded ruthlessness that alienated many within the party.

Like Xi, Bo had left a desk job in Beijing to enter grassroots politics in the 1980s, becoming a county official in the northeastern province of Liaoning. Backed by his father’s lobbying and his own hard-charging ways, Bo scaled the local hierarchy to become mayor of Dalian, an industrial seaport in Liaoning, and then provincial governor. He earned a reputation for splashy politics, pursuing prestige real-estate projects, staging international fashion shows, and micromanaging the media to craft a glowing personal image.161 Named commerce minister in 2004, Bo brought his overbearing panache to the international stage, upstaging superiors in trade talks with the U.S. Though Bo secured a Politburo seat in 2007, his antics had also made him influential enemies in Beijing, who engineered his transfer to the inland megacity of Chongqing to keep him out of the corridors of power.

But Bo wasn’t deterred. As Chongqing party boss, he plotted his return to national prominence by mixing Maoist nostalgia with populist policies. In a campaign known as “singing red, smashing black,” he encouraged mass singing of Mao-era “red songs,” saturated local airwaves with revolutionary content, and directed a vicious purge of underworld groups that also toppled entrepreneurs and local elites who opposed him. He championed a state-heavy economic program, juicing growth and addressing social inequities with debt-fueled spending on infrastructure, public housing, and welfare programs.162

Bo’s “Chongqing model” was popular among residents, leftist intellectuals, and even some senior officials, who saw it as a way to put China back on a more egalitarian footing and boost support for the party. When Xi visited Chongqing in late 2010, he too praised the city’s enthusiasm for Mao and its purge of underworld groups.163 Some party insiders said Xi’s gesture was tactical, masking his wariness of a potent rival behind his own sympathies for Bo’s Maoist revivalism. “Bo and Xi were destined for a showdown,” Cai Xia, the former party scholar, told me. “Both of them wanted to become China’s number one.”164

Bo seemed certain to claim a seat on the Politburo Standing Committee, until February 2012, when Chongqing’s erstwhile police chief, Wang Lijun, walked into a U.S. consulate with a stunning revelation: Bo’s wife had murdered a British businessman with poison. Just days earlier, Wang had been stripped of his police duties after telling Bo about his wife’s role in the killing, a falling out that left Wang fearing for his life. Chinese police surrounded the consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu soon after Wang entered, sparking online rumors that he was trying to defect. The standoff lasted some thirty hours as Wang parlayed with American diplomats and Chinese central government officials for guarantees of his safety. He eventually left the consulate on his own, escorted to Beijing by a vice minister of state security.

Chongqing authorities said Wang was receiving “vacation-style treatment” due to stress and overwork, a claim ridiculed on Chinese social media. Bo himself responded by traveling some four hundred miles to a military base in southwestern China to visit the PLA’s 14th Group Army, a unit that traced its roots to guerrilla forces that Bo’s father had led in the 1930s. The trip alarmed some senior leaders. They felt Bo was courting the military at a moment of personal crisis, a politically fraught maneuver that recalled the PLA’s once-pervasive factionalism that the party sought to quash.165

When the nine-man Politburo Standing Committee convened to discuss the Wang case, deliberations centered on whether investigations should go beyond the former police chief, according to an account of the meeting that Premier Wen’s wife relayed to a business associate.166 Zhou Yongkang, an ally of Bo and the Standing Committee member overseeing China’s security services, said the probe should stop at Wang. While other leaders pondered Zhou’s remarks, Xi seized his moment, arguing that investigators should also look into anyone else who might have been involved. Wen agreed with Xi, as did Hu Jintao. When the Standing Committee voted at a subsequent meeting in March 2012 on how to handle the Wang case, only Zhou opposed plans to expel Bo and open a broader probe.167

A week later, Wen used his final press conference as premier to declare an end to Bo’s career, chastising the Chongqing leadership over the Wang scandal and rebuking its indulgence in Maoist theatrics. State media announced the next day that Bo had been stripped of his Chongqing posts.168 Bo would be sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 for corruption and abuses of power, while his wife, Gu Kailai, was separately convicted of murder and given a suspended death sentence, which effectively meant life in prison.

More intrigue started playing out in Xi’s favor just days after Bo’s dismissal. One early morning in March 2012, a black two-seater Ferrari speeding down a snow-slickened road in Beijing smashed into a bridge, broke apart, and burst into flames. The twenty-three-year-old man behind the wheel died instantly, and two female passengers suffered serious injuries. Images of the mangled wreck were splashed on local press and social media. But details about the driver’s identity were suppressed, sparking speculation.169

The driver, as many suspected, came from privilege. His father was Ling Jihua, chief of staff to Hu Jintao and director of the Central Committee General Office, the party’s nerve center that supervises scheduling, document flow, and security for top leaders. Ling ordered a cover-up, worried that revelations about his son’s lavish lifestyle could torpedo his chances for a promotion to the Politburo.170 But attempts to suppress the news only led to Ling’s downfall. In September, state media announced his demotion to a less powerful post, before an influential Hong Kong broadsheet, South China Morning Post, identified Ling’s son as the Ferrari driver.171 Though Ling would cling on for two more years before being purged for corruption, his career was effectively over, depriving Hu of a protégé who could help him assert influence in the Xi administration.

Xi himself added to the intrigue by disappearing for two weeks in September, when he canceled meetings with U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton and other foreign leaders. Chinese officials told American counterparts that Xi had a back injury, but otherwise said nothing about his absence.172 Rumors went wild, with some speculating that Xi had suffered a life-threatening ailment or even an assassination attempt. Some suggested he was in eleventh-hour negotiations with party elders. My Wall Street Journal colleagues Bob Davis and Lingling Wei wrote that Xi was huddling with close advisers at a riverside city in Zhejiang, deliberating policy and sketching out his “China Dream” of national renewal.173 When Xi resurfaced at a Beijing university, Chinese officialdom carried on as if nothing had happened.

The coronation in November was almost underwhelming. Xi emerged first in the new Politburo Standing Committee, which was cut to seven members from nine. Hu turned over his party and military roles to Xi without fuss. Desmond Shum, a well-connected investor who once did business with members of high-powered families, recalled a joyous mood within princeling circles. “The elite in Beijing were saying: ‘the young master has come home, now the butlers can leave.’ ”174





MAN OF THE PEOPLE


TWO WEEKS INTO HIS NEW JOB, Xi brought his colleagues to the National Museum in Beijing, an austere monolith just east of Tiananmen Square, built to mark Communist China’s tenth birthday in 1959. Together they trooped through The Road to Rejuvenation, an exhibition that traced China’s modern history from its humiliation by foreign powers during the 1839–1842 Opium War to its resurgence as a great power in the twenty-first century. It was a well-worn narrative casting the Communist Party as the savior and shepherd of the Chinese people, a story designed to rally patriotic fervor around the party’s authoritarian rule.

Xi took this message a step further. After paying tribute to the Chinese people’s endurance and sacrifice over more than a century of foreign bullying, invasion, and civil war, he urged his compatriots to look ahead. “Nowadays, everyone is talking about the China Dream. In my view, achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese people since the advent of modern times,” he said. “If the country does well and the nation does well, then everyone will do well.” Xi was issuing his personal mission statement, distilled into one simple yet compelling idea: make China great again.

Xi offered few specifics at the time, leaving the substance of the “China Dream” to public imagination. Even so, his appeal to patriotism marked a shift in the party’s vocal register.175 For years, party leaders, scarred by Mao’s rabble-rousing, had tempered their rhetoric, and come to speak a soulless dialect of stuffy slogans and economic targets. Such tedium was adequate when promises of growth and social mobility could secure tacit acceptance of authoritarian rule, but for the party to regain public trust and reclaim its centrality in people’s lives, Xi saw a need to inspire. As he would later tell officials, the party must “tell China’s stories well.” And as storyteller-in-chief, Xi would spin grand narratives of a Chinese renaissance. But first, he would start with himself.

Two days before Christmas 2012, the official Xinhua News Agency published a fifteen-thousand-character report titled: “ ‘The People Are the Source of Our Strength’—A Chronicle of Chinese Communist Party Central Committee General Secretary Xi Jinping.”176 By the party’s opaque standards, the essay offered a remarkably intimate portrait of China’s new leader. It recounted key episodes in Xi’s life, depicting an honest and hardworking official who inherited his father’s revolutionary spirit. Personal vignettes spotlighted Xi’s childhood, his devotion to his parents, his courtship of Peng Liyuan, and even the name of their daughter. Readers learned about Xi’s fondness for home-cooked dishes, his daily phone calls with his songstress wife while she was away on tour, and his occasional late nights watching sports like basketball and soccer.

Never had a Chinese leader promoted his life story so publicly, and with such emotive appeal. While Hu and Wen disappeared behind sterile speeches and monotonous résumés, Xi showcased his personal narrative to validate his rise to power. He presented himself as a humble figure who earned the right to rule through his hard-earned experiences, affinity for common folk, and loyalty to the party. His elite background, once disdained by some peers, was repackaged to portray Xi’s sense of mission and filial piety. Official accounts cast his suffering during the Cultural Revolution as a tale of redemption and triumph, even though broader political and historical discussions about that period remained taboo.

Whereas Western politicians wooed voters to win power, Xi was campaigning after his victory, trying to rehabilitate the party’s battered brand and promote his agenda. Xi expounded his “China Dream” with speeches and inspection tours that fleshed out an expansive vision of an economically vibrant, militarily powerful, and globally influential nation. For his first trip outside Beijing as leader, Xi traveled to Guangdong to pay homage to Deng Xiaoping and pledge further reforms to boost China’s economic might. He visited rural villages and called on peasants in their homes, asking after their needs, tasting their food, and promising more efforts to alleviate poverty. He made high-profile visits to army, air force, navy, space-program, and strategic-missile facilities within his first hundred days in office, something Jiang and Hu didn’t do.177

Within the party, Xi was telling another story—a somber tale of decay, danger, and potential demise. “Matter must first rot before worms can breed,” he warned colleagues, saying the party could crumble under the weight of corruption and ideological deviance.178 The leadership issued a directive, known as Document Number 9, that demanded efforts to resist the spread of Western values. The party required cadres to watch a six-part documentary that blamed the Soviet Union’s collapse not on structural flaws in the communist system but individuals who betrayed the cause.179 Failure to excise these cancers, Xi said, would eventually destroy the party and ruin the nation.
