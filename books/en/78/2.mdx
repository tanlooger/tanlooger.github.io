title: 2 Gripping Iron and Leaving Marks—The Party Cleanses Itself
---




“The party represents unity of will, which precludes all factionalism and division of authority in the party.”

—Joseph Stalin, in The Foundations of Leninism


“For a party and a country as large as ours, if the party center cannot firmly and effectively exercise centralized and unified leadership, there will be situations where people govern independently and act as they wish, and nothing will get done.”

—Xi Jinping



As the novel coronavirus swept through China in January 2020, Kong Lingbao saw little cause for concern. The epidemic seemed far away from his perch in the northeastern rust belt province of Heilongjiang, where authorities had detected just one suspected case of Covid-19, compared to more than four hundred confirmed infections nationwide. The Lunar New Year holiday was nigh and the Communist Party chief of Hengshan, a sleepy district in Jixi city, wanted to go home to see his family, some five hours’ drive away in another city. Even though General Secretary Xi Jinping had ordered all-out efforts to contain the virus two days earlier, Kong demurred when a deputy sought permission to prepare for an outbreak. “Let’s not make the entire district panic,” Kong told the deputy before leaving for home. “I doubt the sky’s going to fall.”1

Provincial leaders launched a full-scale contagion response three days later. Kong returned reluctantly to Hengshan. Still, he told subordinates that “the epidemic isn’t that serious,” and instructed them to carry out their regular duties. As the severity of what would become a global pandemic became clear, Kong remained lackadaisical and appeared languid at work—a demeanor that investigators later attributed to him staying up late to watch pornography.2 Hengshan soon suffered a Covid-19 outbreak, accounting for more than half of the cases detected in Jixi. Kong took the fall. The local commission for discipline inspection, as the party’s internal watchdogs are known, announced a probe into Kong’s alleged dereliction of duty, making him one of the first officials in China to be sacked for mishandling the coronavirus.3

Colleagues once regarded Kong as an up-and-comer who’d risen speedily up the local hierarchy. His downfall, at the age of forty-four, was even faster. Within two months, party inspectors transferred his case to state prosecutors, along with evidence detailing a trail of venality over his two decades in public service. By the end of the year, Kong would be expelled from the party and sentenced to ten and a half years in jail for taking millions of yuans’ worth of bribes, including cash, cars, premium cigarettes, and hundreds of bottles of liquor. “I regret it, I hate it, I hate that I didn’t know how to be content,” Kong wrote in his confession. “I am in the prime of life, in the midst of exuberant youth, yet I have to fritter my time away in prison.”4

Kong’s fate was a familiar one for the millions of officials punished since Xi launched his crackdown on corruption in late 2012. But Kong’s undoing hadn’t been triggered by the usual allegations of criminal misconduct. Party inspectors started probing him not because he was a suspected felon, but because he was a negligent official who failed to execute the party’s directives. His disobedience impeded the government’s response to a deadly pathogen, and may well have cost lives. “He believed he was capable and bold, refusing to listen to different opinions or tolerate supervision from others,” the party’s top disciplinary agency said. “The diseasing of the mind is the most serious of ailments.”5

When Xi first declared war on corruption, his enforcers focused on rapacious officials who took bribes, abused powers, and plundered public money. Politicians and bureaucrats, from top-tier “tigers” to lowly “flies,” would become public enemies overnight once the party accused them of “violations of discipline and the law,” a euphemism for graft. Cadres and state business executives cut back on lavish spending and travel, spurned banquets and gifts, and some even avoided wearing watches at meetings to avoid suspicion they had ill-gotten riches.6 The purge stunned party insiders with its intensity, punishing more than 410,000 people in its first two years, including more than 50 officials of at least ministerial rank. It even toppled a retired member of the Politburo Standing Committee, the party’s top decision-making body, and a level of seniority once considered untouchable.

The campaign portrayed Xi as a strict disciplinarian determined to put his house in order. Authorities directed breathless news coverage with lurid details of greed and sexual deviance, reinforcing the party’s claims that corruption stems from individual degeneracy rather than systemic flaws. Chinese media relished revealing that Zhou Yongkang, the retired Standing Committee member, had fornicated with multiple women and leaked state secrets before getting a life sentence for corruption and abuse of power. News reports chronicled how a top economic planning official, given life imprisonment for taking nearly $6 million in bribes, was turned in by a former mistress.7 An influential Chinese magazine detailed how a disgraced general, later given a suspended death sentence, owned a lavish home covering nearly five acres, complete with three courtyards, two gardens, one fountain, and a stash of solid gold items, including a bust of Mao Zedong.8

For Xi, such depravity is symptomatic of much deeper decay. In public speeches and internal remarks, he speaks of corruption as the result of the party’s most fundamental crisis: its collective loss of faith and a breakdown in authority that have sowed disaffection and discord. “Facts have proven, time and again, that the wavering in one’s ideals and convictions is the most dangerous form of wavering,” Xi said. “I have long been wondering, if we were confronted one day with a complex situation like a ‘color revolution,’ would our cadres all act resolutely to safeguard the party’s leadership and the socialist system?”9 He prescribed a range of remedies, the most fundamental of which is enforcing compliance and control. “The more complex the situation the party faces and the more arduous the tasks it shoulders, the more we must strengthen discipline and safeguard the party’s cohesion and unity,” Xi told the party’s top disciplinary officials in January 2013. “And we must ensure the entire party has a unified will, acts in concert, and advances in lockstep.”10

The task fell to the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, an internal watchdog that polices the conduct of the party’s more than 96 million members. Though the commission is often described as an anticorruption body, the label undersells its fearsome reputation for rough justice. It operates outside, arguably above, the formal legal system, able to seize evidence without warrants, detain suspects almost indefinitely, and kill careers with little recourse. Much like how police departments conduct internal affairs probes, the CCDI adjudicates cases in secret, unless the party decides to make selective disclosures that would, as the Chinese saying goes, “kill the chicken to scare the monkeys.” And while in theory the commission only supervises party members and can do no worse than expel them, its reach extends over every public servant, along with de facto powers to get errant officials convicted, jailed, or even executed.

Under Xi, the CCDI has transformed from a shadowy agency into an omnipresent tool of governance, tasked with enforcing loyalty to the paramount leader and ensuring compliance with his edicts. Some insiders say the commission has never been more powerful, acting as a parallel bureaucracy that circumvents party and state institutions. Its inspectors routinely burrow into party groups, government departments, and state businesses all over the country, assessing their performance and rebuking those who fail to deliver. Wherever the machinery of state seizes up, CCDI officials swoop in to rectify the faults—be they graft, indolence, or foot-dragging. Many even double up as thought police, probing party members on their ideological zeal.

Xi’s crackdown speaks to an old problem for Chinese rulers, often expressed in the ancient verse “the heavens are high and the emperor is far away.” Monarchs and mandarins through the ages have bemoaned how distance dilutes imperial authority and allows local officials to abuse their autonomy. Their Communist successors are no exception, struggling to break up vested interests and rein in local fiefs, while lamenting that “government decrees don’t go beyond Zhongnanhai,” the central leadership compound. Generations of scholars and statesmen grappled with this conundrum but produced no lasting formula, save for a pithy truism still repeated today: “To govern a nation, one must first manage its officials.” Guided by this mantra, Xi believes the answers lie in pairing ancient tradition with Leninist hardware, to forge a regiment of ruthless martinets who can keep the party and the nation in line.





ANCIENT TRADITION


HISTORIANS CREDIT QIN SHI HUANG, the first emperor of a unified China, for pioneering an early system of bureaucratic supervision more than 2,200 years ago. He appointed a “chief censor” to his imperial Qin court and vested the official with sweeping powers to police conduct across the government. Outranked only by the grand chancellor, the chief censor could advise the emperor on affairs of the state, formulate policy, impeach officials, and even amend laws.11 Subsequent dynasties built on the Qin example, creating a corps of censors who served as the emperor’s eyes and ears, punishing corrupt mandarins, censuring inept bureaucrats, and executing imperial edicts.

This system reached an apogee during China’s last two imperial dynasties. The Ming and Qing each maintained a much feared censorate that effectively operated as an independent arm of government, surveilling the bureaucracy for wayward behavior and enforcing the emperor’s policies across his dominions.12 The tradition of supervision survived the Qing collapse. Sun Yat-sen, the revolutionary revered as the father of modern China, advocated for a Control Yuan to be set up as one of five branches of government in the Chinese republic, responsible for auditing state organs and disciplining officials—an idea his Nationalist Party implemented after winning power in the late 1920s.

The Chinese Communist Party, meanwhile, drew inspiration from the Soviets to create its first control commission in 1927. Early incarnations of this agency were often caught up in factional battles and neglected by Mao, who preferred to enforce his will through purges and rectification campaigns. Under Mao, the party would create (and dissolve) a number of supervisory bodies, including the first CCDI in 1949, but these were generally toothless, thinly staffed, and ultimately dissolved during the Cultural Revolution.

The CCDI was reestablished in 1978, about two years after Mao’s death.13 Its first priorities were to purge Maoist radicals and enforce party rules, though fighting corruption took greater importance as China’s economic reforms opened opportunities for graft. But the agency remained relatively feeble in the 1980s, as liberal-minded leaders like Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang tried to set clearer boundaries between the party and state. A separate Ministry of Supervision was resurrected in 1986 to monitor government workers, implicitly bringing them outside the ambit of party inspectors. The leadership also curtailed the CCDI’s powers by downgrading the commission chief’s party rank and dissolving many party disciplinary groups that were embedded in government agencies.14

The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests halted these reforms. Deng Xiaoping resolved to restore the party’s authority over state organs, and the CCDI soon regained its watchdog powers over government bodies. In 1993, the commission absorbed the supervision ministry through an arrangement known as “one set of personnel with two signboards,” under which officials could switch between party and state identities as circumstances required, though party titles remained more powerful. During this post-1989 restructuring, the CCDI also acquired its most notorious investigative tool—the secretive process of indefinite detention and interrogation known as shuanggui, where investigators often subjected suspects to physical and mental abuse with impunity.15

As China’s economy took off in the 1990s and 2000s, the party designated fighting corruption as a key formal objective. Accordingly, the CCDI switched its focus to investigating official graft, rather than political misconduct and ideological deviance.16 Corruption may be an ageless scourge, but post-Mao China provided fertile ground for knavish officials and crony capitalists. Pro-market reforms and investment-led growth minted immense wealth and gave officials abundant opportunities to manipulate the allocation of land, capital, and other resources in return for bribes and favors.17 Government careers promised not just secure employment, known as the proverbial “iron rice bowl,” but also under-the-table benefits that dwarfed meager official salaries. A 2008 report released by China’s central bank cited estimates suggesting that as many as eighteen thousand corrupt officials and state business executives had fled abroad or disappeared since the mid-1990s, absconding with some 800 billion yuan in assets, equivalent to roughly $120 billion and 2.7 percent of China’s gross domestic product that year.18

Anticorruption crackdowns pursued by Deng’s successors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, often fizzled after initial fervor. They lasted long enough to eliminate rivals without inflicting too much pain on the political and business elite, who had grown accustomed to greasing palms to sidestep bureaucracy and secure state largesse. A few tigers would be slayed and some flies swatted, but the leadership would ultimately hold off from a broader purge. One fear was that China’s economy could seize up without what some believed to be the lubricating effects of corruption—particularly in the form of “access money,” or what University of Michigan political scientist Yuen Yuen Ang calls “the steroids of capitalism,” whereby businesses offer rewards to officials “not just for speed, but to access exclusive, valuable privileges.”19

The CCDI targeted mainly mid-level graft and could do little to stem the broader economic forces that were fueling avarice across government ranks. One academic analysis of corruption cases disclosed from 1993 to 2010 indicated that graft committed by higher-ranking officials was less likely to be detected and investigated than that involving junior bureaucrats.20 In another study, Georgia State University professor Andrew Wedeman presented data suggesting that corrupt officials faced far lower risks of getting caught during the mid-2000s than they had about a decade earlier.21 Such uneven enforcement “allowed corrupt low-level officials to climb the career ladder and enter the senior ranks,” Wedeman wrote. “Flies thus became rats; rats grew into wolves; and wolves morphed into tigers.”22

The problem stems largely from how the party keeps its enforcers on a tight leash. Before opening cases or meting out punishment, regional and local disciplinary agencies must get approval from party committees at their own level in the hierarchy. The CCDI itself must seek consent from the party leadership. This means the more senior an official is, the harder they are to investigate. The process is highly politicized, structured to prevent the party’s bloodhounds from sniffing out skeletons in the darkest closets. Once unleashed, though, there’s little stopping them from ripping their prey apart. An investigation against a big-name target was almost certainly party infighting waged under the cover of combating corruption—a convenient fig leaf that departed from how Mao-era officials purged rivals by accusing them of political deviancy.23

When Jiang Zemin purged Beijing party boss Chen Xitong on corruption charges in 1995, insiders characterized the case as the moment Jiang established himself as party leader, emerging from the shadows of party grandees who’d installed him as general secretary six years earlier. In 2006, Hu Jintao scored his own win against Jiang’s clique, the “Shanghai Gang,” when the party sacked Shanghai chief Chen Liangyu for graft. Both cases gripped public attention and unnerved officials who feared being implicated, but neither Jiang nor Hu followed up with a systemic crackdown.

By the time Xi vowed to cleanse the party, many officials thought he was following a well-worn playbook: conduct a short and sharp campaign to consolidate power in the name of fighting graft. But rather than a ritual bloodletting, Xi unleashed a veritable bloodbath. The party has punished more than 4.6 million people in the decade since Xi took power, including some 627,000 in 2021 alone—nearly four times the total in 2012, the final year of Hu’s leadership.24 For Xi, the fight is existential. “Corruption is a cancer of society,” he told top CCDI officials in 2013. “If the scourge of corruption worsens, eventually the party and the nation will be ruined.”25





HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED


THE COMMUNIST PARTY’S TOP DISCIPLINE enforcers operate from a nondescript office tower in central Beijing, roughly ten minutes’ drive from the Forbidden City and the former imperial garden of Zhongnanhai. High walls surround the unmarked compound, whose austere gateway features no signs save for the street number, though red flags sometimes flutter above as a hint to the occupants’ identity. In the yard, a centuries-old locust tree towers over a stone inscription that exalts the impartial administration of justice.26

As the apex agency directing a network of regional and local branches, roving inspection teams, and embedded agents, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection penetrates all levels of government and supervises every party and state organization across China. In the United States, similar responsibilities would be shared across agencies such as the Justice and Treasury Departments, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Government Accountability Office—all of which are subjected to scrutiny from Congress, the judiciary, and a free media. The CCDI, however, is modeled on Soviet hardware. It answers only to the party, its priorities echo the leadership’s agenda, and its work is often used to shape and justify the outcomes of elite power struggles.

CCDI investigators pick up scents in various ways. Sometimes they unearth information in routine audits. Occasionally, misbehaving officials get exposed on viral videos and social media posts. Most trails, however, originate from the copious complaints and anonymous tip-offs that gush through petition offices, web portals, and telephone hotlines. Tipsters even resort to a bit of cloak and dagger, given how complaints have in the past been leaked and invited retaliation. One whistleblower, fearing detection by a corrupt municipal police chief, switched car registration plates three times while driving to meet investigators.27 In another case, a retired CCDI official recalled how an informant arranged a stealthy liaison in a hotel lobby, where he would read a newspaper as a signal, only to walk away at the last second as an investigator approached. The informant called back later, demanding a new rendezvous at a place without security cameras.28

The hunt begins after investigators sift out promising leads and gather enough preliminary evidence to persuade superiors to open a case. Their approval kicks off a more thorough probe, though often by that point the suspect’s guilt is all but certain. Proceedings culminate in a “case examination,” a sort of closed-door trial where officials assess the evidence and recommend penalties where necessary.29 Suspects and lawyers can’t attend. Errant cadres may receive warnings, lose their party posts, be put on probation, get expelled, or even have their cases transferred to state prosecutors. An accused can ask the commission to reconsider a verdict, but successful appeals are almost unheard of.

If the alleged offenses are severe or sensitive enough, suspects may be spirited away into secret interrogations—the dreaded process known as shuanggui, or “dual designation,” in reference to how the party summons targets for questioning at a designated time and place. Detainees are held in covert locations without access to lawyers or relatives, typically for up to six months, though extensions can be made. Shuanggui detainees have described being held in a variety of locations, ranging from temporary sites such as hotels and villas to purpose-built facilities similar to prisons.

Details about detention facilities are scarce, though state media and scholars have offered glimpses inside. Researchers who visited a county-level detention center in eastern China described a twenty-acre compound in a remote area where no residences existed within a two-kilometer radius. The facility was unmarked, secured by high walls and guards, and featured recreational amenities like basketball and volleyball courts for officials who often stayed on-site for extended periods.30 To prevent suspects from harming themselves, detention rooms typically feature walls and furniture covered with soft padding, and lack windows or power sockets. At least two officials watch each detainee at all times. The questioning takes place in the holding cells, with a desk and chairs on one side and a bed on the other. Other detention centers, according to official accounts, feature a strong political aesthetic in interrogation rooms, where copies of the party oath and party charter are displayed and used by investigators trying to rehabilitate suspects.31

The secrecy shrouding shuanggui is meant to shield investigators from undue influence or intervention. In reality, it has facilitated rampant abuse. With the party placing a premium on written confessions, interrogators often try to extract avowals of guilt by means fair or foul. They swing between mildness and menace, offering leniency at one moment and issuing threats the next, such as warning suspects that their family may face consequences unless they cooperate. Investigators in one northeastern city favored breaking down detainees by serving home-cooked food prepared by the suspects’ mothers.32

With few people watching the watchers, a culture of impunity festered. Wayward inspectors tipped off suspects and manipulated cases for bribes, extorted money from investigation targets, or even tortured suspects to secure confessions. Former detainees describe being tormented through beatings and simulated drowning, though high-ranking officials were less likely to be roughed up. Detainees have died from abuse or suicide. Court officials sentenced six investigators to jail for between four and fourteen years after they drowned a detainee in 2013. Most shuanggui cases end with confessions and are sent for prosecution in state courts, where conviction rates exceed 99 percent.33

To stop the rot, Xi turned to a skilled political operator and longtime friend, Wang Qishan. A vice premier at the time, Wang boasted a storied career as a policy wonk, banker, and administrator, and impeccable credentials for what many considered a crucial yet unforgiving assignment. Chinese media had nicknamed him “fire brigade chief” in recognition of his crisis management skills, from handling China’s largest bankruptcy in the late 1990s to parachuting into Beijing as mayor while the capital reeled from the 2002–2003 SARS outbreak. A princeling through marriage to a party elder’s daughter, Wang had a reputation for honesty helped by his lack of children, which supposedly meant he had less incentive to enrich his family. Most crucially, Wang was politically reliable, someone Xi had known since growing up in Beijing and being rusticated to the same province during the Cultural Revolution.34

Wang became CCDI secretary in November 2012. Though he ranked sixth in the party’s seven-man leadership, he tackled his role with such derring-do that many insiders considered him China’s second most powerful official. An avid historian, he asked his staff to read Alexis de Tocqueville’s treatise on the French Revolution and write up their views on why the monarchy fell.35 He called on his investigators to inspire shock and awe, pressing them into working fifteen-hour days and clocking countless overtime hours without weekend or vacation breaks.36 Wang took his first big scalp just weeks into the job, opening a corruption probe against the deputy party chief for the southwestern province of Sichuan. More than a dozen other “tigers” would be slayed over his first year in charge.

To prevent local authorities from stymieing investigations, Wang stepped up the use of “central inspection teams” to scrutinize regional governments, party organs, and state institutions and assess their compliance with party directives. These teams reported directly to Beijing and were led by retired officials without ties to the regions to which they were sent, minimizing conflicts of interest. Inspectors would move into a local hotel or office building, where they would interview officials, audit accounts, and receive complaints in person, through letters, or over the phone. Wang also harnessed public anger to his advantage, launching an official CCDI website that drew some 24,800 tip-offs in its first month online, or more than 800 a day.37

Wang professionalized the investigative process, encouraging officials to rely less on confessions and more on sophisticated technology, such as data analysis to detect misconduct and forensic accounting to trace illicit assets. The CCDI brought in personnel with academic training in finance, law, and technology to tackle complex cases of financial malfeasance. Disciplinary commissions were restructured to separate the powers of investigation, case review, and punishment between different departments, reducing opportunities for graft and abuses of power. Investigators often faced resistance. When a central inspection team visited Henan province in 2014, local officials staked out the team’s hotel to try to block whistleblowers from meeting investigators. Some officials in northeastern China provided visiting inspectors with meals that were too salty or spicy to eat, while others arranged for noisy renovation work to take place near the inspection teams’ work spaces.38

A sense of foreboding, even fear, shrouded the party as Wang stretched his dragnet across government ministries and state companies. Social media lit up with rumors of officials getting detained during work meetings, and in one case, a daughter’s wedding.39 Others reportedly committed suicide before investigators could reach them. State-enterprise executives sometimes disappeared without warning, only to surface later in news reports about a corruption probe.

Wang’s targets included party stalwarts whose downfalls were politically helpful for Xi. Zhou Yongkang, the former leadership member who oversaw China’s security services, went down with his cronies in the domestic security apparatus and energy sector after an extensive investigation that recuperated at least 90 billion yuan—or $14.5 billion at the time—worth of seized assets, including bonds, stocks, real estate, and artwork.40 The purge of Ling Jihua, former chief of staff to Hu Jintao, sapped the former leader’s influence and capped a clearing out of corrupt officials linked to the coal-rich province of Shanxi. A posse of high-ranking generals close to Jiang Zemin, including two former vice chairmen of the Central Military Commission, were also dismissed, allowing Xi to replace them with his own associates.

Xi actively steered these purges. People familiar with the process say the CCDI had to secure Xi’s approval to investigate and punish officials at the vice-ministerial rank or higher. Probes against some high-profile business executives, including an insurance mogul once married to a granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, proceeded only with Xi’s personal sign-off.41 Such close control over major investigations exposed him to aspersions that he aimed to cashier rivals and accrue more power. Xi seemed to anticipate this criticism and tried to make sure that he remained unimpeachable. In late 2012, members of Xi’s immediate and extended family started shedding some assets and investments, a disposal that party insiders say was made at the behest of Xi and his mother.42

Xi went one step further in 2014, when authorities reportedly arrested one of his maternal cousins, Ming Chai, for alleged criminal wrongdoing. A former paramilitary policeman who became a naturalized Australian, Chai was doing business in China at the time and often flaunted his family connections while chasing commercial opportunities, according to his friends and associates. One former business partner told me that Chai was someone who enjoyed lavish living and made grandiose promises that he never kept, such as offering to give the partner a tour of Zhongnanhai and arrange a news conference in the Great Hall of the People to promote their business. Nonetheless, there was no indication that Xi did anything to advance Chai’s interests, or had any knowledge of his cousin’s business dealings.43

Many within China’s elite circles believed that Xi was trying to demonstrate his incorruptibility through a gesture known as dayi mieqin, or destroying one’s kin as an act of righteousness. According to Hong Kong political monthly Front Line, which first reported the case, Xi personally informed the Politburo Standing Committee about Chai’s arrest just a day or two after the CCDI announced a formal probe against Zhou Yongkang.44 Front Line chief editor Lau Tat-man later told me that the magazine was tipped off by a pro-Xi princeling who portrayed the arrest as an example of Xi’s upright character.45 Chinese authorities never publicly acknowledged Chai’s case, though party insiders and associates say he stayed in custody for a period of time before resurfacing in Australia by late 2015.46

While state media played up Xi’s tiger-slaying, he avoided wholesale attacks on China’s “red bloodlines,” the revolutionary families enmeshed in lucrative sectors of state industry and private business. Xi still needed support from the party elite and attempts to investigate red aristocrats would have faced overwhelming pushback, says Desmond Shum, a former Beijing-based investor who once did business with members of elite political clans. “Red bloodline families are untouchable,” he says. “It’s like being a made man in the mafia.”47

Such cold calculations animate discipline inspection commissions at every level. County-level agencies with limited resources, for instance, might consider whether it is worthwhile incurring investigative costs that far exceed the value of assets that might be recovered from a suspect.48 Politics, above all, are the deciding factor. As the deputy chief of one county disciplinary agency told researchers, inspectors face pressure to meet quotas on the number of officials they should investigate. Exceeding the quota may give the impression that the county suffers from serious corruption, while falling short of it by a large margin could suggest that local investigators are ineffective, the deputy chief said. “Therefore, a process of rational calculation is needed to determine who is to be investigated: there cannot be too many or too few.”49

Xi too faces a balancing act. While his campaign has been popular with many ordinary Chinese, sustained revelations of high-level graft could erode this goodwill. “The more corruption the campaign reveals, the more it suppresses citizen support for the regime,” Harvard political scientist Yuhua Wang and George Washington University professor Bruce Dickson wrote.50

The fear that Xi inspired within the party had also become debilitating. Some officials preferred to procrastinate, worried that they could make decisions that ended up putting them at risk of investigation.51 Others sought safety by engaging in what scholars call “nauseating displays of loyalty” to their paramount leader.52 For Xi, this pervasive sense of dread is both boon and bane. A feared leader is often a powerful one. But too much fear can paralyze the bureaucracy. And Xi’s campaign would prove that both can be true at the same time.





THE PARTY LEADS EVERYTHING


WHEN THE COMMUNIST PARTY REVISED its disciplinary rules in October 2015, perspicacious analysts picked up on a potent new provision tucked inside. Party members would be punished, it said, if they “irresponsibly discuss the party center’s policies” and cause damage to “the party’s centralized unity.”53 Officials offered few clues at the time on what the new rule meant, but the scope of its power became evident.

Within weeks, the party dismissed the chief editor of the official newspaper in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang, saying he had irresponsibly discussed and contravened official policies on fighting terrorism and religious extremism.54 Authorities took down one of Beijing’s deputy party secretaries two months later for wrongdoing that included irresponsible discussion of party policies, before sacking the governor of the southwestern province of Sichuan for disloyalty and dishonesty to the party.55

The purges alarmed some party insiders, who feared that Xi was cracking down on dissent while elite resentment simmered against his anticorruption shake-up and handling of China’s slowing economy. CCDI officials soon confirmed those fears, declaring that the new rule against “irresponsible discussion” was meant to punish cadres who sowed confusion and discord by questioning Beijing’s decrees.56 “Discipline inspection commissions are political organs,” the CCDI said. Their fundamental duty, the agency explained, was “to resolutely uphold the party center’s authority, and ensure that government decrees are thoroughly enforced.”57

The CCDI was fast becoming an ideological inquisitor. Its inspectors ferreted into government agencies, state enterprises, and universities to conduct “political health checks” and punish those who deviated from Xi’s directives. Disciplinary officials censured some of China’s most powerful institutions, from the party’s propaganda department to the finance and public security ministries, for lacking political loyalty and ideological fervor.58 The crackdown took on an almost ritualistic quality, as targeted officials resorted to obsequious displays of repentance. In 2016, for instance, after inspectors chastised authorities in the port city of Tianjin for slack leadership and corruption, the municipality’s top official promised ruthless remedies and demanded that his subordinates swear unflinching fealty to General Secretary Xi.59 “Loyalty that isn’t absolute is absolute disloyalty,” Tianjin’s party chief at the time, Li Hongzhong, wrote.60

China’s Communist leaders, like their imperial forebears, have long struggled to assert control over its vast realms and the legions of functionaries who govern in their name. The party hasn’t helped itself by maintaining a jealous monopoly on power, suffocating attempts to build independent institutions and the rule of law. Unfettered by checks and balances like democratic elections and a free press, local officials can wield near-autocratic powers over their domains. Beijing indulged such autonomy as part of Deng’s economic reforms, which discarded Marxist orthodoxy, encouraged pragmatism, and brought in technocrats to manage economic and social affairs. Central authorities encouraged lower-level officials to road-test policy ideas that could be rolled out nationally. Local governments engaged in cut-throat competition, chasing investments and growth targets that would help officials win promotion and line their pockets.

The benefits were staggering, as were the pitfalls. Deng-era decentralization had unleashed dynamism that helped China boost its gross domestic product by more than fiftyfold, from less than $150 billion in 1978 to $8.2 trillion by 2012, and bring more than 600 million people out of poverty.61 After Beijing overhauled the tax structure in the mid-1990s to funnel more revenues directly to the central government, local authorities made up budgetary shortfalls with ever-more rapacious methods, such as expropriating and selling rural land, that stoked public unrest. The economy grew addicted to a debt-fueled, investment-heavy growth model that incentivized unproductive spending, wasting some 42 trillion yuan from 2009 to 2013 by one estimate.62

The freewheeling ways of the reform era alarmed Wang Huning, a scholar turned party theorist, who worried that China might come unglued if its rulers failed to rein in a fast-changing society. In a 1995 interview, just weeks before leaving Shanghai’s Fudan University to join the party’s top policy research office, Wang argued that China needed a centralized political system that could deliver cohesive policy-making in the face of unprecedented challenges, and suppress any social instability kicked up by rapid growth. “In a place without central authority, or a place where central authority has become weakened, the country would be mired in a state of division and chaos,” Wang said in one of his last public utterances as an academic. “A strong central authority is the fundamental guarantee for achieving rapid and stable development at a relatively low cost during the process of modernization.”63

Wang took his ideas to Beijing, where he went on to serve, rather extraordinarily, as a top aide to three successive Chinese leaders, including Xi. The pair started working together after Xi joined the top leadership in 2007 and took charge of a policy committee—of which Wang was a member—that oversaw “party building,” an arcane term of art describing efforts to cultivate cohesion and ideological zeal. As leader-in-waiting, Xi echoed Wang’s ideas in private conversations, telling people that China needed a strong central leadership to hold the country together.64 After becoming general secretary in 2012, Xi retained Wang as a key policy adviser and moved to concentrate power.

Xi named himself head of powerful party committees that oversaw key portfolios including economics and finance, national security, foreign affairs, legal affairs, and internet policy. He installed close confidants and trusted associates in key positions. Li Zhanshu, whom Xi had known since their time as county chiefs in Hebei, first served as chief of staff to the general secretary before becoming China’s top lawmaker. Liu He, a princeling who grew up alongside Xi in Beijing, became the leading adviser on economic and financial affairs, siphoning off some of Premier Li Keqiang’s influence over policy-making.65 Xi’s college roommate Chen Xi took senior roles at the party’s Central Organization Department, where he could screen officials and influence personnel appointments.

Those outside Xi’s inner circle felt increasingly marginalized. He undermined rivals with hollow promotions to roles with little authority or by switching their portfolios to separate them from their power bases. In some instances, Xi neutralized potential opponents by purging their aides and supporters through disciplinary probes. People familiar with this practice describe a discreet and meticulous process, where Xi would ask trusted disciplinary inspectors to quietly prepare dossiers—often running in the hundreds of pages—on senior officials he wished to undermine. Xi would also authorize investigations against the officials’ close associates under the pretext of demonstrating those associates’ honesty, making it hard for the targeted officials to block the probes. An early target of this technique was Li Yuanchao, a Politburo member who served as vice president during Xi’s first term. Once seen as a contender for higher office, Li stepped down from his party and state roles in 2017 and 2018 respectively after a number of his close associates were detained, even though he was young enough to stay in active politics under the prevailing retirement norms at the time.

Access to the general secretary, a controlled privilege, became scarcer still. Xi once told foreign dignitaries that he didn’t have a mobile phone, which meant that most people—apart from his closest advisers—could only reach him through carefully screened meetings, calls, and written submissions.66 While his predecessors used summer retreats at the seaside resort of Beidaihe for informal policy discussions with party grandees, insiders say Xi has largely discarded this tradition and warned retired leaders against meddling in politics. Some princelings once able to meet Xi privately to discuss affairs of state say they no longer enjoy the privilege, and must go through Xi’s chief of staff if they wish to express their views. Xi’s relatives have told friends that they will no longer help relay messages to the leader. One princeling who has known Xi for decades told me that the leadership keeps tabs on elite party families through informants within their staff—scrutiny that dissuades many princelings and retired elders from criticizing Xi.

Whereas his predecessors often delegated the finer details of policy-making to specialists, a practice known as “grasping the large, releasing the small,” Xi prefers a hands-on approach. He often makes direct requests for policy adjustments and insists that he gets the final call on key decisions. State media credits Xi for personally overseeing the formulation of policies big and small, from major economic plans to campaigns to reduce food waste and improve public toilets.67 When party inspectors discovered that local officials in Shaanxi province had been illegally building some twelve hundred villas inside nature reserves, Xi issued instructions on six occasions over four years, demanding punishment for the offenders, and stronger protections for the local ecology.68

Xi enacted new party rules to “institutionalize” his autocratic style. He ordered senior officials to submit annual accountings of their work, and started a performance review system that graded leaders on political rectitude, alongside other metrics. He directed a relentless rule-making spree, setting party statutes to dictate how every member—from senior leaders to the rank and file—should work and behave, and how they would be punished for any deviance. He set the party’s first ever five-year plan for drafting internal regulations, and proceeded to enact or revise far more major ordinances than his recent predecessors.69 By the party’s centenary in 2021, the Xi administration had enacted or revised more than 2,400 sets of party regulations, some two-thirds of all rules in force at the time.70 Authorities regularly publish guidebooks and explanatory articles to help officials navigate the dizzying array of strictures.

Xi’s power-grabbing alarmed officials who believed he was upending the prevailing system of collective leadership and growing overreliant on a small inner circle of advisers. He himself showed awareness of the problem, telling officials to “make more friends at the grassroots who can speak from the heart,” so they could better “understand the real situation” facing ordinary people and more accurately gauge the national mood.71 Even so, he remained committed to his autocratic methods. “Some said we have done enough over the past five years in emphasizing the party’s centralized unity, and that we should now focus on promoting intra-party democracy,” Xi told senior CCDI officials in January 2018. “The people who utter such strange rhetoric, some are politically confused, some bear ill intentions and have dirty linen, and are trying to muddle their way out of trouble.”72

Two months later, Xi launched the most extensive reorganization of China’s party and state bureaucracies in more than a decade, designed to ensure that “the party leads everything.” Party committees overseeing economic reforms, finance, cybersecurity, and foreign affairs were upgraded to commissions, giving their directives more weight in a hierarchy-obsessed system. Some government departments were subsumed into their party equivalents. Others were scrapped entirely, with their responsibilities transferred to a party agency.

The most crucial change, which required a constitutional amendment, established a new anticorruption agency with a mandate to extend party-style discipline over millions of government workers outside the party. Despite its formal status as a state organ, the National Supervisory Commission is essentially the CCDI performing similar functions under another name. Its inaugural director was a deputy chief of the CCDI (and a Xi associate), while its investigative staff are mainly party enforcers double-hatting as government inspectors.

On paper, the NSC enjoys a broad remit to investigate government workers for graft, fraud, and dereliction of duty, and, in some cases, mete out punishment without going through the courts. In practice, rights activists say, the new system provides legal cover for the party’s draconian investigative techniques. China’s legislature passed a new supervision law in March 2018, in conjunction with the NSC’s establishment. The law renamed the notorious shuanggui process as liuzhi, or “retention in place,” and set new rules that cap detentions at six months, though suspects are still denied access to legal counsel and their families.73 Investigators received new powers to use wiretaps and other electronic eavesdropping techniques that were previously considered off-limits for CCDI probes.

The NSC’s inaugural director, Yang Xiaodu, said the new agency plugs gaps in government oversight by tripling the number of people subjected to party supervision.74 This remit means scrutinizing even the lowliest of workers on government payrolls—including office clerks, elementary-school teachers, and urban sanitation workers—and punishing their misdeeds.75 In some cases, the pressure has grown so intense that offenders turned themselves in, even though they hadn’t been suspected. And that is the goal, Yang said, to “let our contingents of cadres maintain their own purity.”76





QUALITY CONTROL


PAN LEILEI KNEW NEXT TO NOTHING about Marxism when she joined the Communist Party in 2004. A university sophomore at the time, she hadn’t studied much socialist ideology and wasn’t politically inclined. As a devout Christian, she shouldn’t have been allowed into the officially atheist party at all. Her faith notwithstanding, Pan ticked all the right boxes for membership: she was vice chair of the student council, scored good grades, and was popular among her peers. “For people like us with ‘low political consciousness,’ ” Pan recalls, “joining the party was a matter of having your teacher appreciating your qualities and giving you a recommendation.”77

Pan was one of 1.37 million people who joined the party that year, when its membership grew by 2 percent. Her new affiliation didn’t require much of her, aside from attending seminars and writing essays. After graduation, Pan started working, pursued postgraduate studies in theology, and had forgotten all about the party until early 2016, when an official called Pan’s father to ask if his daughter wanted to remain a Communist. It was a question that Xi Jinping was, in effect, asking every party member, when he ordered a nationwide audit to weed out the unworthy and retain only those committed to his cause.78

If Pan wanted to stay in the party, she would need to stump up years’ worth of unpaid membership dues and recommit to party activities. She declined. A party committee in Pan’s hometown struck her name off its registers in August 2017, citing her “slack organizational discipline.” Pan hadn’t heard about the decision until I asked her about it a few weeks later. “The party has never defined my life,” she said. “Leaving the party doesn’t mean opposing the party.”79

Since its founding in 1921 as a scrappy underground group of about fifty people, the Chinese Communist Party has swelled into a sprawling bureaucracy with more than 96 million members. If it were a sovereign state, it would rank well within the world’s twenty most populous countries, surpassing the likes of Germany and Turkey. Party members reached into every corner of Chinese society, but among them were plenty of deadweight—inept, indifferent, and work-shy members who joined out of self-interest rather than self-sacrifice.

The problem could be traced to the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution, when Deng Xiaoping wanted to revitalize the party with younger and better educated cadres who could provide a strong technocratic core and drive China’s development.80 Officials expanded the recruitment criteria, favoring urbanites with college degrees while deemphasizing applicants’ social class, a traditional gauge of political reliability. The party grew less rigorous in enforcing Marxist orthodoxy over the years, an ideological drift that worsened after the Tiananmen Square protests and the Soviet collapse. Officials and scholars debated alternative political models and, at one point, even contemplated renaming the party to reflect its tilt toward state-led capitalism. But rebranding the party would mean renouncing its revolutionary past and potentially causing an irrevocable split within the ranks, said Li Junru, a former vice president of the Central Party School.81 The party thus remained professedly communist, while opening its doors to more new ideas, Li said.82

In practice, this change meant accepting entrepreneurs into the party and tolerating some political pluralism, such as by allowing independent think tanks and civil society to contribute ideas and provide social services. Party membership more than doubled between 1978 and 2012, reaching some 85 million people, or more than 6 percent of China’s population. But as China prospered, party membership came to be seen less as a political commitment and more as a way to boost careers and profit from power. A 2005 survey of private entrepreneurs in China found that 62 percent of respondents preferred to hire a party member over a nonmember, all else being equal.83 Joanne Song McLaughlin, an economist at the State University of New York at Buffalo, estimated in 2016 that party members earned 7 to 29 percent more than nonmembers.84 “In a society where networks are still the greatest enabler, the Communist Party offers one of the most complete and extensive ones available,” said Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London. Party membership is “a useful box to tick—something that might give you a slight edge when going for a job or promotion.”

With time, many party members stopped attending meetings or paying their dues. Some even found it embarrassing to acknowledge their affiliation publicly, conscious that many peers regarded the party as a band of corrupt and careerist mercenaries. “Imagine that Xi is the new CEO of a company where employees don’t show up for work, don’t participate in work activities, and can’t even articulate what the company’s mission statement is,” said Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. “That’s roughly what Xi faced in late 2012.”85

Such incohesion was a grave threat for a political system that depends on its officials’ loyalty and commitment to implement directives from the top. “For a Leninist party, organizational integrity means the competence to sustain a combat ethos among political office holders who act as disciplined, deployable agents,” wrote the Berkeley political scientist Ken Jowitt, who argued that Leninist parties must constantly inspire members with a compelling vision to fight for, or risk decaying toward potential doom.86

Xi prescribed a multipronged remedy: preaching the gospel, cracking the whip, and trimming fat. At one of the first Politburo meetings he chaired as general secretary, Xi pledged to control the party’s size and forge a more selective and elite organization, whose members were fired with fervor and steeled with discipline.87 “The party’s creativity, cohesion and combativeness directly affect not just the fate of the party, but also the fate of the country, the people, and the nation,” Xi said later. “If our party weakens, breaks up, or collapses, what meaning will our political achievements have?”88

Xi wielded his China Dream as a rallying cry, calling on cadres to devote themselves to restoring national glory. Cognizant that communist ideals lack cachet in China’s increasingly capitalistic society, he extolled ancient culture and soft-pedaled socialist dogma. He celebrated Confucius to inspire virtue among officials and justify authoritarian rule as part of a deep-rooted political tradition, even though the party had traditionally condemned the ancient sage as a feudal relic.89 Xi also promoted Karl Marx, holding up the German philosopher’s egalitarian ideals as a spiritual beacon in a materialistic age, while sidestepping the intellectual substance of Marxist theories.90

Mao regained some prominence in public life, as Xi invoked his revolutionary slogans and revived some Mao-era political practices that had fallen out of fashion, including “criticism and self-criticism” sessions where cadres find fault with themselves and each other. But Xi also shunned certain tenets of Maoism, particularly the ideas of class struggle and mass mobilization. Whereas Mao had called on the people to attack what he saw as a decaying party, Xi wanted to save the party from within. In this regard, Xi drew inspiration from Liu Shaoqi, a revolutionary leader who championed the use of political inquisitions and education campaigns to enforce correct thinking among party members. Borrowing from Liu’s playbook, Xi ordered mass indoctrination drives that required officials to read his speeches and study party directives to become “qualified party members.”

Anthologies of Xi’s remarks became required reading for all cadres, along with Liu’s most famous treatise, “How to Be a Good Communist.” Government agencies, state businesses, and even private companies arranged weekly study sessions for party members, who had to pass quizzes testing their political knowledge or face counseling and reprimand. Participants had to document their activities in a process known as zhuatie youhen, or “gripping iron and leaving marks”—writing detailed notes and taking photographs that featured party flags, as proof that the meetings were party-related. “Red tourism” boomed as officials arranged pilgrimages to revolutionary landmarks across China, including the rural village of Liangjiahe, where Xi was rusticated during the Cultural Revolution.91 At government offices and state enterprises, including airlines, banks, and hotels, party members were told to showcase their identity in public by wearing party flag pins and displaying hammer-and-sickle logos at their workstations.

Such chores became even more ubiquitous after the party launched in 2019 a mobile app known as Xuexi Qiangguo, whose name can translate as “Learn from Xi to Strengthen the Nation.” A digital-age equivalent of the “little red book” of Mao quotations, the app supplies users with essays, videos, and quizzes promoting “Xi Jinping Thought,” which party members must consume to earn points and meet quotas. The chore became vexing enough for some users to devise work-arounds, using custom-made software to simulate app usage.92

At Xi’s behest, the party launched a nationwide campaign to collect unpaid membership dues, an effort state media billed as a test of loyalty. In 2016, Tianjin officials reported collecting some 277 million yuan, or about $41 million, in backdated dues from more than 120,000 party members at state-owned companies.93 Online forums crackled with party members fuming about the hit on their finances. An employee at the China Academy of Space Technology in Beijing posted a poem lamenting how he had to make a lump-sum payment worth “five years of transport expenses or the cost of a half-year’s supply of baby formula.”

Xi’s demands diminished the appeal of a government career.94 As one local official lamented, “We are now required to work like a superman, live like a Spartan and think like a robot.”95 Bureaucrats quit in droves, many seeking greener pastures in the private sector or even early retirement. Official data showed that roughly twelve thousand civil servants resigned in 2015, some 43 percent more than the preceding year, though some researchers believe the true figure is significantly higher.96 One former Chinese judge, who quit in 2016 to join the private sector, blamed Xi’s political-study campaigns for adding to already onerous workloads and sapping morale in the judiciary. “Even when things get busy, our supervisors will still chair study meetings, asking us if we’ve paid attention to the party plenums, or watched the evening news bulletins,” said the former judge, who presided over criminal cases in a major city. “This is an unreasonable use of our time.”97

The exodus stoked fears of a brain drain, given that competent cadres were more likely to find new jobs while inept ones stayed behind. “Many officials who resigned were in fact high-performing front runners,” wrote Li Lianjiang, a professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studied the phenomenon.98 Others saw an opportunity to trim a bloated bureaucracy. “If we don’t allow unqualified and uncommitted members to leave the party, it will lead to misjudgments about the organization’s strength,” said Ren Jianming, a professor of clean governance at Beihang University in Beijing.

The party has long grappled with the question of its ideal size. As Xi once warned officials, “the Soviet Communist Party had 200,000 members when it seized power, and had 2 million members when it defeated Hitler, but when it had nearly 20 million members, it lost power.”99 Xi ordered tighter gatekeeping in the recruitment process, and directed the party’s personnel department to conduct a nationwide audit in 2016 to track down estranged members and cull those deemed unworthy. The party’s membership growth rate dropped from 3.1 percent in 2012 to just 0.1 percent in 2017, the slowest expansion since the party started releasing data annually in the early 1990s.100 Even so, Xi hasn’t allowed a decline, which could dull the party’s prestige.

Party regulations state that members are free to leave, and that they are automatically deemed to have withdrawn if they fail to attend party activities, pay dues, or perform their duties for six straight months. In reality, quitting isn’t quite so easy. “There are members who don’t dare to quit, aren’t allowed by the party to quit and are unable to quit in practice,” one Marxism professor explained, “because there’s an overly politicized interpretation of what it means to quit the party.”101 When a state-owned telecommunications giant ordered employees to catch up on years of unpaid party dues, one of its sales supervisors told me she was stunned by the request and considered quitting the party to avoid paying. In the end, she and her colleagues handed over the money—more than two months’ wages in her case—because “we were scared that not paying dues or quitting the party would affect our spouses and jeopardize our children’s futures,” the supervisor said. “Quitting the party could become a black mark against me.”102

The more prominent a member is, the more difficult it is to leave. High-profile departures cost more in reputational damage for the party, which also prefers keeping influential figures under the thumb of its disciplinary apparatus. Zhang Ming, a retired politics professor at Beijing’s Renmin University, discovered this as he tried to get struck off party registers by declining to pay his dues and telling colleagues not to pay on his behalf. University officials told Zhang that they wouldn’t revoke his membership, citing orders from above. “They keep dragging their feet,” he said. “I find it frustrating.”103





RED RITUALS


IN THE SPRING OF 2018, soon after Xi Jinping reiterated his demands for eliminating rural poverty in China, government agencies in the southwestern city of Mianyang were told to devote at least 70 percent of their time and personnel to helping the poor. With inspectors due to appraise their progress in meeting poverty-relief targets, local officials were eager to impress—with flawless paperwork.

Pang Jia, a judicial clerk in her twenties, was roped in to help. She and her colleagues filled out forms certifying compliance, a practice known as “leaving marks” to ensure accountability. They clocked in overtime every day while still doing their day jobs at local courts, but their work was often wasted as higher-ups revised their requests. Sometimes superiors asked for formatting changes in the documents. On other occasions they wanted more forms to be filled out. But even the smallest tweaks would consume dozens of hours, as entire dossiers had to be rewritten.

At one point, aid workers had to scramble when their bosses demanded photographic proof for all home visits to poor households. “Some cadres brought winter coats during summer house visits to make up for the photos they didn’t take in winter,” Pang recalls. But no sooner had they gathered the required photos, than their bosses changed their minds again, saying the images were no longer needed. “Doing all this repetitive work and dealing with inspections really wore me out,” Pang says. “We often joked that, as long as we don’t need to fill out forms, we’d be happy to go down and live with rural residents for all 365 days a year!”104

For all the pains, it never crossed Pang’s mind that she and her colleagues could miss their work targets in Xi’s poverty-alleviation campaign, a centerpiece of his China Dream. The notion was unthinkable, for failure would invite punishment for negligence or even dereliction of duty. For many officials, the safest option was simply to “cover one’s ass,” applying tricks of the bureaucratic trade to please bosses, paper over problems, or deflect blame.

The party denounces such practices as “formalism” and “bureaucratism”—the official epithets for behavior whereby officials perform political rituals that prioritize form over substance. Communist governments have agonized over this problem since the days of Stalin and Mao, who both railed against the ills of bureaucracy and tried to curb them with sweeping purges. The phenomenon has grown even more pervasive under Xi, whose top-down governance has driven officials toward foot-dragging, fraud, and other unproductive practices—so as to satisfy their leader’s demands and avoid his wrath.

While the ills of bureaucracy are universal, the way some of these dysfunctions manifest in China are peculiar to the party’s Leninist structure and revolutionary roots. Unlike Weberian bureaucracies, which are notionally apolitical and dispassionate, Leninist parties are often powered by ideological zeal and charismatic authority. The party in China has long relied on what political scientists call “campaign-style governance,” whereby Beijing mobilizes large volumes of personnel and resources to achieve specific goals within a certain time frame. Mao ran his campaigns by appealing directly to the people, often with disastrous consequences. Deng and his successors avoided mobilizing the masses, relying mainly on party members to implement their campaigns. Once activated, cadres would drop everything to focus on their new priorities, knowing that good results could boost their careers. Party researcher Yang Xuedong calls this arrangement a “pressurized system” of governance, where lower-level officials feel compelled to fulfill targets from superiors who control their professional prospects.105

Nonetheless, during the reform era, the central leadership often tolerated a degree of local discretion that rewarded innovation and risk-taking. Beijing’s broadly worded directives afforded local officials considerable latitude in deciding how to achieve their objectives, while also allowing the central government to blame front-line cadres for any problems that arise. Xi, however, has upended this dynamic with his emphasis on dingceng sheji, or “top-level design,” whereby Beijing exerts policy control down to the grassroots, backed by the threat of punishment for those who disobey.

Despite Xi’s promises to institutionalize governance, he exerts personal influence over how policies are designed and executed. Party insiders describe Xi as a micromanager. This tendency has stifled debate and sowed confusion, sometimes leading to policies that aren’t carefully thought through. Some officials, unsure how far to go with Xi’s demands, err on the side of aggressive interpretation—pursuing overly ambitious policies with excessive zeal, only to reverse them later.

In 2021, after Xi asked officials to overhaul China’s $100 billion private-tutoring industry—seen as fueling a costly rat race among students chasing scarce placements at top schools—education officials drafted plans that included setting new limits on tutoring for children up to the equivalent of ninth grade. But Xi felt that the measures were too soft, and said so in a one-sentence note to the education ministry. Officials responded by expanding the limits to include students up to twelfth grade, and adding requirements for all private education firms to re-register as nonprofits.106 The harsher rules sparked panic selling on education companies listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, wiping out tens of billions of dollars’ worth of market value.107 Chinese regulators scrambled to calm foreign investors and promised that Beijing would consider the market impact when setting future policies.108 And despite the regulatory shock and awe, private tutoring simply went underground, as parents continued seeking classes for their children and fueled the rise of a thriving black market.109

Xi’s interventions have also discouraged officials from taking initiative on matters where they worry about making choices with which the top man might later disagree. It’s a particularly irksome phenomenon for a leader who, despite his dominance within the party, has often found that his power has limits. “Some only act when the party’s central leadership has instructed them to do so,” Xi told senior CCDI officials, lamenting that many cadres weren’t competent enough to handle complicated issues, and were reluctant to act without direct orders from the top. “I issue instructions as a last line of defense,” Xi said. “How can it be the case that if I don’t issue instructions, no one would do any work?!”110

A key problem, officials say, is that Xi often frames his edicts with the provisos of jiyao yeyao haiyao, or “not only, but also, and also.” As in, officials must not only achieve policy targets, but also minimize side effects, and also satisfy additional requirements—which may well jeopardize their main goals. For instance, Xi wants state enterprises to not only become more market-oriented and competitive, but also serve the party’s interests, and also avoid taking too much risk. He wants his diplomats not only to fight vigorously for Beijing’s interests, but also to foster a glowing global image for China, and also ensure stable ties with the West. When the Covid-19 pandemic threatened to disrupt Xi’s plans to eradicate rural poverty by the end of 2020, he insisted the party must not only achieve poverty-relief targets on time, but also do so in a sustainable manner, and also stamp out fraud and corner-cutting by officials desperate to meet deadlines.

Xi has repeatedly condemned formalism as a “major enemy” of the party and the people, and ordered the CCDI to spare no effort in curbing such behavior.111 But some of his remedies only seem to create more bureaucracy. In 2020, after Xi demanded new efforts to curb red tape, a party publisher compiled a 136-page anthology of the general secretary’s remarks on “formalism and bureaucratism” that became required reading for all cadres. Government agencies and state businesses arranged seminars for officials to study the text, tying up more of their time in political classes.112

Such conundrums became prevalent in Xi’s war on poverty, particularly after the party issued a directive in 2015 that linked cadres’ promotions to their ability to meet poverty-relief targets and required officials to sign “responsibility pledges” that made them accountable if things went wrong.113 To avoid punishment, some officials turned to deception. One trick was to designate families with incomes above the poverty line as poor households, while excluding those that were actually below the threshold. Thus, when outside inspectors came to assess progress in poverty relief, the designated “poor” households would satisfy requirements for having “escaped poverty.”114 In the southern city of Yuxi, four poverty-relief workers were punished for defrauding their superiors by documenting phantom house calls and citrus-planting classes that residents said never took place.115

Some officials pursued “vanity projects” that gave the appearance of local development without actually improving residents’ lives. In 2018, township officials in the eastern city of Fuyang ordered houses in some rural villages to be painted white, hoping to deliver some quick results after their superiors demanded that residents’ homes be fixed up within three months. Party investigators later discovered that the “whitewashing” project had cost some 8 million yuan, yet haphazard work left many houses only partially painted. Authorities dismissed Fuyang’s party boss and condemned the project as a damaging act of formalism that wasted public funds.116

Many officials would set aside their day jobs to clock required hours working in poor rural villages, even if that meant neglecting their primacy duties. After flooding at a coal mine in central China killed seven workers in early 2020, labor activist Han Dongfang called up the local union to ask what was being done to improve safety. Not much, a union official replied, as the cadre handling the incident had gone away to join poverty-relief efforts in the countryside. “It’s like a local fire brigade seeing a fire in a neighboring district that’s getting more attention, so they ignore the fire burning beside them and rush to join in at the other one, because they can score results there,” Han says.117

Officials blamed the party’s deep-rooted culture of “answering to superiors,” whereby bureaucrats focus on satisfying their bosses’ demands, often by misrepresenting reality and neglecting the needs of ordinary people.118 But even when cadres do honest work, they spend most of their time on banal rituals, attending repetitive meetings, and producing mountains of paperwork that could cost as much as tens of thousands of dollars to print and weigh in at hundreds of pounds. “The only thing the party has taught us is how to hold meetings and issue documents,” one mid-level official told sociologists studying the phenomenon. “If they take that away, what will we do then?”119

The scourge has gone online too, with public servants complaining that their WeChat messaging apps have become inundated by bosses and colleagues texting demands around the clock. Chat rooms created for work discussions often devolve into so-called kuakuaqun, or “groups of praise,” where subordinates speak sycophantically in support of superiors. Some post emojis depicting genuflection “in order to make superiors happy,” while others say fawning things like “boss, you’ve worked hard” or “boss, you’re brilliant,” according to a party-published guidebook titled Combating Formalism.120

The problem grew so alarming that in 2019 Beijing launched a national effort to slash red tape, calling on all levels of government to “ease burdens” on officials by reducing the number of meetings and documents, imposing word lengths on paperwork, and setting time limits on internal confabs. Officials made a show of complying with the campaign, but within months, many cadres found themselves crushed again by “mountains of paperwork and seas of meetings.” A year after the campaign began, state media documented complaints from one county chief who had to sit through seventy-one video conferences within a month, and a township cadre worn out from attending nine meetings in a week, each dragging for two to three hours as attendees did little more than recite prepared remarks.121

Such indulgence in risk aversion and energy-sapping rituals can have dire consequences. When Covid-19 started spreading in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019, local officials feared sharing bad news with disease-control agencies in Beijing, causing delays to the national response. Central-government officials in turn forbade the publication of any research on the novel coronavirus without approval, while holding back critical information about the contagion from the outside world until unauthorized leaks forced them to acknowledge the data.122

Even after Xi acknowledged the crisis and ordered a full-scale response, front-line bureaucrats were consumed with paperwork. Instead of conducting health checks or distributing supplies to residents in home confinement, many officials spent hours each day filling out documents for higher-level agencies, many requesting the same information. The problem grew so exasperating that Xi made a personal intervention at a leadership meeting. “There’s actually not much difference in the content of these forms,” he said. “But not a single document or a single department has helped villages resolve their urgent need for even a single mask or a single bottle of disinfectant.”123

Xi’s domineering ways didn’t help either. In 2021, when some officials suggested that China should consider learning to live with virus and move away from “dynamic zero Covid,” a containment strategy centered on strict lockdowns and mass testing, Xi responded in anger, sending a note to subordinates asking if officials were becoming “lax and numbed” in fighting the contagion. Zero-Covid remained in place through most of 2022, even after harsh lockdowns across large cities and entire regions enraged citizens and battered an already weak economy.124 Spurred by Xi’s demands for zero tolerance, local officials adopted what many citizens see as unnecessarily draconian measures—confining millions of residents indoors for weeks, manhandling people into quarantine, killing pets, and requisitioning private apartments as isolation facilities. Even as Xi urged officials to minimize social and economic disruptions, he continued insisting that “dynamic zero Covid” was necessary for protecting lives.125

Adherence to strict pandemic controls became a test of political loyalty, despite their mounting costs and questionable efficacy.126 Even as recurrent lockdowns curbed consumption, throttled industrial output, and fueled unemployment, senior officials ordered the party to act in lockstep with the top leadership and “struggle against all words and deeds that distort, question or repudiate our country’s pandemic-prevention policies.”127 The chief of China’s National Health Commission name-checked Xi thirteen times in an essay urging stronger efforts to contain Covid-19, and called on all party members to unify their thoughts and actions with their leader’s demands.128

The government vacillated between easing and tightening pandemic protocols toward the end of 2022, as China’s economy sputtered under the weight of zero-Covid. Officials said they would loosen some curbs, raising hopes of a return to normalcy, only to double down on control measures when infections surged.129 The tipping point came in late November, when a fire in a Xinjiang residential building killed at least ten people. Witnesses alleged that Covid-control barriers had hampered rescue efforts, and the ensuing outrage erupted into street protests against zero-Covid in Beijing, Shanghai, and other major cities—which some analysts called the biggest outbursts of dissent in China since the 1989 pro-democracy movement.130 Days later, Xi told visiting European officials that the unrest stemmed from frustrations with Covid restrictions, and suggested that the pandemic had entered a less deadly phase.131

With his containment strategy overwhelmed by highly transmissible Covid variants while economic and social costs continued to mount, Xi relented.132 Authorities swiftly dismantled zero-Covid policies, softening their rhetoric on the dangers of the virus and lifting public-health protocols.133 The sudden switch caught local officials off guard, sending them scurrying to redirect resources from containing outbreaks to managing a surge in infections and deaths—particularly among the elderly, a demographic where Covid vaccination rates had been laggard.134 Hospitals and pharmacies struggled to deal with swelling demand for intensive care and fever medication, a lack of readiness that physicians privately blamed on the government’s funneling of resources toward mass virus testing, quarantine programs, and lockdowns during the first three years of the pandemic.

Health officials estimated that nearly 250 million people may have caught Covid in the first twenty days of December 2022, while some 80 percent of China’s population likely had infections by late January.135 Authorities said they recorded more than 72,500 Covid-related deaths in mainland Chinese hospitals during the first six weeks after they started unwinding pandemic controls—a figure widely seen as an undercount, but still a major spike from the roughly 5,200 deaths reported in the nearly three years prior.136 Though officials insisted that zero-Covid bought time for China to prepare its transition to normality, Xi ultimately lurched toward a haphazard exit that cost lives and exacerbated economic woes.137 As one Chinese entrepreneur noted, “The ability to control is different from the ability to govern.”138

Xi’s micromanaging style has worn on many bureaucrats, but his discipline enforcers offer daunting deterrence against dissent. “When loyalty is the critical measure for officials, no one dares to say anything,” one official told the Wall Street Journal. “Even if the instructions from the great leader are vague and confusing about what to do.”139
