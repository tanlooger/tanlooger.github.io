“To destroy a nation, you must first destroy its history.”

—Gong Zizhen, Chinese intellectual (1792–1841)


“Use the past to serve the present.”

—Mao Zedong


“The future is certain; it is only the past that is unpredictable.”

—Old Soviet joke



Over seventeen days in the winter of 1950, a Chinese army surprised, surrounded, and battled bitterly with American-led forces through hellish conditions near a man-made lake in North Korea. Tens of thousands were wounded, killed, or frozen to death in one of the most brutal clashes in modern warfare. Remembered in the United States as the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, the engagement has split historical opinion ever since. Chinese accounts often depict a strategic success, one that helped drive imperialist invaders out of North Korea before the Korean War settled into a bloody stalemate. American narratives portray a moral victory for an outnumbered United Nations force, which avoided annihilation while inflicting horrendous losses on what Beijing called an army of people’s volunteers.

Seven decades later, as tensions with the U.S. flared again, China summoned some of its finest filmmakers and spent a record $200 million to dramatize the battle for the big screen. The result was The Battle at Lake Changjin, an action-packed epic that earned more than $900 million to become China’s highest-ever grossing film. Bristling with jingoism, the movie tracked a Chinese company commander and his jejune younger brother as their unit fought caricatured American troops across snow-swept landscapes. Foreign reception was mixed. Some critics called the film rabble-rousing propaganda, comparable with patriotic Hollywood blockbusters like Pearl Harbor and We Were Soldiers. South Korean netizens savaged Chinese filmmakers for a one-sided portrayal that excluded Korean voices and whitewashed Pyongyang’s culpability in starting the war.

At home, the movie was a smashing success, showered with fulsome praise after hitting theaters on the eve of China’s October 1 National Day in 2021. Filmgoers raved over a memorable scene that depicted how a group of Chinese soldiers, eulogized as the “Ice Sculpture Company,” froze to death while lying in ambush. “We seem to have become accustomed to watching omnipotent superheroes flying across the big screen and accepting cultural input from the West,” one commentator wrote in the party tabloid Global Times. “Unlike the illusory superhero stories in the West, China’s The Battle at Lake Changjin is from real history.”1

The nationalistic gushing grated with Luo Changping, a former investigative reporter who made his name exposing corruption among senior Chinese officials.2 A prominent muckraker in a country where few dare pursue the calling, Luo had remained outspoken on social media even after being forced out of journalism in 2014. “Half a century later, our countrymen rarely reflect on the justifiability of the war,” he wrote on the Weibo microblogging platform a week after The Battle at Changjin Lake’s release in China. “Just like how the soldiers in the Sand Sculpture Company didn’t doubt the ‘wise decision-making’ at the top.”3

The blowback was instant. Netizens denounced Luo for insulting Chinese martyrs, noting that “sand sculpture” is slang for idiot. Many also condemned him for questioning Beijing’s reasons for joining what it calls the “War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea” in late 1950, when North Korea was being overrun after its failed invasion of the South. The following day, police detained Luo for allegedly “damaging the reputation and honor of heroes and martyrs”—an amorphous offense set down in 2018 to penalize dissent against official histories.4 Weibo shut down Luo’s account and state media cheered his downfall. A local court later sentenced Luo to seven months in jail and ordered him to make a public apology.5 The severity of Luo’s punishment sent shock waves through scholarly circles and social media. Historians and influencers alike lamented the shifting red lines in public speech and grasped an emphatic message about how Xi Jinping waged battle for China’s hearts and minds: to secure the Communist Party’s future, he was exerting an iron grip on the past.

While Chinese leaders since Mao had often stressed the importance of controlling historical narratives, Xi enforced party canon with unusual vigor. Just weeks after taking power, he urged vigilance against efforts to topple the party by smearing its past—a threat, known as “historical nihilism,” that had corroded the party of Lenin and Stalin and brought down the Soviet Union. “To destroy a nation, you must first destroy its history,” Xi said, quoting nineteenth-century Chinese intellectual Gong Zizhen, who lamented the Qing government’s weakness in the face of Western power. “Domestic and foreign hostile forces often make hay with China’s revolutionary and modern history, sparing no effort in launching attacks, distortions and smears, with the fundamental goal of confusing the people’s will.”6 The party of Mao must counter such subversion by telling its stories with verve, Xi argued, and persuade the Chinese people that only Communist rule can steer their teleological path to greatness. “History and reality tell us that only socialism can save China,” he said. “This is the conclusion of history, and the choice of the people.”7

Since then, Xi has directed an all-encompassing struggle to shape China’s collective consciousness. Party propagandists revised textbooks and museums to boost Xi’s image, while diluting criticism of Mao. State media denounced skeptics of party lore as enemies of the state. Lawmakers prescribed criminal and civil penalties for those who defamed party-approved “heroes and martyrs.” Regulators scoured social media and video games for alleged distortions of party and national history, scrubbing dissent and banning errant users. Researchers reported increasing difficulty in accessing Chinese archives and their troves of documents, while censors scrubbed digital academic databases of old articles that contradicted modern political sensibilities. And there was intimidation too, with the banning of books, canceling of classes, and suing of scholars who challenged party canon, as well as ad hominem attacks and denial of visas targeting foreign researchers whose work Beijing disliked. Some Chinese historians, chafing against the party’s strictures, moved abroad.

Xi often speaks of wielding the “mirror of history” as a tool of domestic control and foreign policy. He urges officials to “tell the Chinese Communist Party’s stories well,” and direct national campaigns to propagate official narratives in schools, museums, and across popular culture. Xi himself is one of the biggest beneficiaries, with his life story turned into the centerpiece of a personality cult and propagated with an ardor unseen since the days of Mao. The party rewrote its charter and issued new historical texts to crown Xi as one of China’s greatest leaders, a sentiment encapsulated in an oft-quoted refrain: “Mao Zedong built the nation; Deng Xiaoping enriched the nation; Xi Jinping will strengthen the nation.”

By portraying the party as an indispensable guarantor of China’s ascendancy over a fading West, Xi hopes to secure his own power, and entrench Communist rule for generations to come. “For the party, history is science. Whoever controls what is certified as history controls the truth,” says Timothy Cheek, a professor and China historian at the University of British Columbia. “Xi Jinping has to tell a story that’s compelling, and his way of telling it is to ensure that nobody else gets to tell another story.”





THE PAST SERVES THE PRESENT


DAYS AFTER TAKING OFFICE as general secretary in November 2012, Xi Jinping took his fellow leaders for an excursion just a few hundred yards down the road from their Zhongnanhai leadership compound in central Beijing. Their destination was the National Museum, an austere monolithic complex just east of Tiananmen Square, built in time for the tenth anniversary of the People’s Republic in 1959. Curators there had maintained for years a popular exhibition recounting China’s modern history, and Xi saw a fitting stage for his first piece of political theater as paramount leader.

Titled The Road Toward Rejuvenation, the exhibition begins with the First Opium War of 1839–1842, when a victorious Britain forced the Qing government to open ports for trade and cede the island of Hong Kong. It was a decisive moment of infamy, the first in a series of “unequal treaties” that foreign powers imposed on Beijing, and what many in China consider the start of their nation’s “century of humiliation.”8 The displays went on to depict the decline of a proud, preeminent civilization that had dominated Asia before falling laggard to the West and suffering ignominious defeats to imperialist powers, which occupied land, established concessions, and plundered riches on Chinese soil. Featuring more than twelve hundred artifacts and nearly nine hundred photos, the exhibition explained how the Qing dynasty atrophied and collapsed, precipitating decades of civil war and foreign invasion.9 The Communist Party emerged from this crucible of chaos, so the story goes, inspired by Marxism and steeled by Mao’s derring-do as they waged revolution and battled imperialist aggressors before liberating China in 1949.

It is a familiar story for generations of Chinese, drilled into their common consciousness through textbooks, propaganda, and popular culture. The “century of humiliation” forms the spine of the People’s Republic’s founding mythology, where the party emerged as China’s rightful rulers by avenging its indignities and restoring its honor. This narrative is Xi’s most valued inheritance, handed down since Mao to successive leaders who tapped its evocative power to justify the party’s legitimacy—and their own. It fuels pride and righteous anger that the party uses to defend authoritarian rule, vilify dissent as treasonous, and condemn foreign critics who “hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.”10

Throughout more than 170 years of trials and tribulations since the Opium War, “the Chinese people have never given in, have struggled ceaselessly, and have finally taken hold of our own destiny and started the great process of building our nation,” Xi told his entourage, in remarks aired on national television that evening.11 Now, he declared, the Chinese people have become more confident and capable than ever of rejuvenating their nation, a goal he called the China Dream. Xi was reaching for the heart of the national mythos, vowing to deliver his nation’s resurgence as a great power, as ordained in the party’s promise of inexorable progress toward a socialist utopia.12 “Our generation of Communists should draw on past progress,” he said, “and chart a new course for the future.”13

China’s rulers since antiquity have sought to legitimize their power by dictating the past, and the Communist Party is no exception. Mao was a storyteller par excellence. Through speeches, prose, and poetry, he won followers with compelling yarns about the party’s struggle to save a suffering China. Though Mao spoke with a thick accent from his native Hunan province that eluded many of his listeners, his speeches would be refined and rendered comprehensible in writing, and disseminated over the airwaves and print. Mao would tell officials to “use the past to serve the present,” a saying often interpreted as an appeal to repurpose history to satisfy current exigencies. “Such storytelling enabled the Communists to convert every defeat, retreat, and crisis point into a victory of some sort, a sleight of hand, in which disasters become magical occasions, and failures superhuman accomplishments, a kind of magic realism matched by ruthlessness,” Yale political scientist David Apter wrote. “Such fictive truths became self-fulfilling prophecies, enabling the Communists to become virtually miraculous in their own eyes.”14

History is also ultima ratio, the final argument, for settling discord within party ranks. “Like any political figure, Mao needed examples and events to illustrate and if possible validate his preferred strategies as a ‘correct line,’ ” Apter wrote. “Mao became a storyteller precisely because of the practical need to establish his hegemony over others who claimed to be better Marxists than he.”15 In 1945, soon after wrapping up a ruthless purge known as the Yan’an rectification movement, Mao directed the passage of a Central Committee resolution on “certain historical questions.” The text recast past events to entrench Mao’s dominance, praising his “correct leadership” and excoriating his rivals for their “erroneous” thinking.16 The party then enshrined “Mao Zedong Thought” as one of its guiding ideologies, alongside Marxism-Leninism, consecrating the Chairman’s ideas as part of its holy scriptures.

Deng enacted his own resolution in 1981, this time to draw a line under the Cultural Revolution, repudiate Mao’s megalomania, and reset the shattered party onto a reformist path. The document spent more than 34,000 characters condemning Mao’s personality cult and arbitrary rule. It discarded dogmatic notions of “class struggle,” and urged a restoration of collective leadership and intra-party democracy. Despite heated debates during the drafting process, Deng secured the Central Committee’s unanimous approval for his resolution, consolidating his authority as paramount leader—in place of Mao’s successor Hua Guofeng—and unifying the party around his platform of pragmatic governance and market-opening reforms.17

Work on the 1981 resolution lasted more than one and a half years. Deng reviewed drafts and often requested changes, insisting that the document had to draw a distinction between Mao the person, whose errors must be repudiated, and Mao Zedong Thought, which the party exalted second only to Marxism-Leninism. Whereas the Soviet Union could afford to denounce Stalin, as Nikita Khrushchev did in 1956, Mao commanded such an emotional hold over China that a full-throated renunciation of the man, Deng feared, would erode the party’s legitimacy or even topple the entire edifice. The resolution thus proclaimed Mao as a “great Marxist and great revolutionary,” whose mistakes were secondary to his successes.

Deng’s verdict held sway for the next three decades. Mao’s portrait stayed on the facade of Beijing’s Tiananmen, the Gate of Heavenly Peace, even as the country embraced the capitalist impulses that he had loathed. Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao upheld the Dengist canon, celebrating the party’s successes while smothering its calamities. In the 1990s, patriotic education became mandatory in schools, where students learned to revere the party for forging a “new China” and righting the wrongs suffered during the “century of humiliation.” Propagandists policed popular culture to ensure its alignment with the party line. Hit television dramas in the late 1990s and early 2000s depicting the Qing’s Kangxi and Yongzheng emperors featured anachronistic references to how Kangxi “recovered” control of Taiwan, even though the island hadn’t been ruled by any Chinese dynasty preceding the Qing, which annexed Taiwan in the late seventeenth century. An acclaimed 2003 drama series, Towards the Republic, which recounted the Qing collapse and Sun Yat-sen’s troubled efforts to build a constitutional republic, suffered hefty cuts at the hands of censors, who most glaringly axed the show’s final scene—Sun expounding his ideal system of government in a lengthy speech—and replaced it with twenty minutes of white screen.18

Authorities did tolerate some deviation from official canon. Academics could publish writings and teach classes on the Mao era and the Cultural Revolution, as long as they didn’t question the party’s legitimacy. Yanhuang Chunqiu, an influential history magazine founded in 1991 with backing from reformist party elders and whose evocative name can translate as “China Through the Ages,” emerged as a bastion of liberal thought and pushed boundaries with essays that probed the darkest corners of party history, irking conservatives and sometimes suffering sanctions, while winning fans among party moderates.19 Yang Jisheng, a former Xinhua News Agency journalist who documented the 1959–1962 Great Famine in a two-volume opus titled Tombstone, saw his book suppressed in mainland China after its publication in 2008, but was able to speak privately about his work and continue living in his Xinhua-sponsored apartment in Beijing.20

The party’s narratives, however, were being stretched to their limits by the time Xi took power. High-octane growth had fueled economic polarization, which tore at China’s social fabric. The spirit of optimism and opportunity that had powered the Deng era wore thin with people left behind in an increasingly unequal society, while those who thrived sought a cleaner break from the Maoist past. Within the party and beyond, voices of post-traumatic anger with Mao’s dictatorship clashed with nostalgia for his bygone egalitarian ethos—a rift that could unravel the party’s claims of being an unimpeachable steward of a rising China.

Xi moved to close the cleavage. Addressing senior officials in January 2013, he suggested that the party should “correctly evaluate” its early decades in power and grasp the continuity between the epochs of Mao and Deng. The post-Mao period shouldn’t be used to repudiate the Mao era, and vice versa, he said. As Xi saw it, China’s past struggles had set the stage for its present success, and despite some painful detours, the arc of Chinese history bent toward glory.

As chief narrator, Xi brooked no challenge to his stories. In 2016, party authorities seized control over Yanhuang Chunqiu by ousting its top editors and managers, who then declared their twenty-five-year-old magazine defunct, saying they would rather pull the plug than allow their publication to be co-opted by the party.21 When Yang Jisheng finished writing a history of the Cultural Revolution, titled The World Turned Upside Down, officials warned him against publishing or discussing his work, and blocked him from traveling to the U.S.22 Yang himself came under fire from neo-Maoists and state media.23 The assault on some of the party’s most esteemed chroniclers disturbed some insiders who sensed an ominous turn in the political climate. Whereas Deng had tried to encourage a degree of intellectual curiosity and debate within the party, Xi chose to restrict speech and unify thought, says Yan Huai, a Deng-era official who once assessed Xi’s suitability for promotion in the 1980s. “To maintain control, there are only two ways: through the gun barrel and the pen shaft,” Yan says, using party-speak for the military and the propaganda apparatus.24

Xi’s pen shafts spilled considerable ink rewriting established narratives. In 2015, as Xi prepared to mark seven decades since the end of World War II with a military parade, party historians pushed revisionist claims that Mao’s Communist forces had played a crucial role in resisting Japanese invaders during the war, challenging the scholarly consensus outside mainland China that Chiang Kai-shek’s Nationalist, or Kuomintang, armies did most of the fighting.25 A Chinese film depicting a 1937 battle in Shanghai, where Kuomintang troops defended a warehouse against Japanese attackers for several days, was shelved just before its scheduled release in 2019, after some party historians accused the film of glorifying the Republic of China flag flown by the Kuomintang—even though it was historically accurate.26 When the movie came out a year later, viewers noted how the ROC flag was mostly shown from a blurry distance.27

Such propaganda hit a crescendo ahead of the party’s centenary in 2021. Xi ordered a national campaign to study party history that experts describe as China’s largest mass education drive since the Mao era. Pro-party chronicles saturated bookstores, cinemas, television screens, and social media. Officials commissioned concerts with patriotic songs like “Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China.” Government agencies, state enterprises, and schools organized history-themed field trips, film screenings, and quizzes. Private businesses, law firms, and even a Shanghai temple dedicated to the Chinese god of wealth arranged party history classes for employees. Airlines staged in-flight sing-alongs and poetry recitals to teach passengers about the party’s past. China’s internet regulator launched web platforms and a telephone hotline for the public to report instances of “historical nihilism,” such as content that criticized the party’s leaders and policies.

The messaging revived Marxist notions of history proceeding inexorably along a revolutionary trajectory. “Looking back at history, it was in the face of various turbulences and chaos that the Chinese Communist Party was born, grew up and became strong,” He Yiting, former executive vice president of Beijing’s Central Party School, wrote in a newspaper commentary. A clear-eyed assessment of international affairs, he said, “fully confirms a major judgment made by General Secretary Xi Jinping: the times and trends are on our side.”28

Xi carved that message into the party gospel in late 2021, becoming only the third party leader to enact a resolution on history.29 Crafted over seven months under Xi’s direct supervision, the document purports to chronicle the party’s “major achievements and historical experience” during its hundred-year existence. Even so, it devotes more than two-thirds of its roughly 36,000 characters to exalting Xi’s achievements, lionizing him as an epoch-defining figure uniquely suited to steer China through uncertain times.30 Xi’s name appears twenty-two times, surpassing Mao’s eighteen mentions and Deng’s six. Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao are each mentioned once.

Unlike Mao and Deng, Xi refrains from overtly attacking rivals or predecessors in his resolution. Still, the document clearly conveys Xi’s disapproval, without naming names, with how Jiang and Hu governed China. Before Xi took power, the resolution says, the country faced “problems that have not been resolved for a long time,” in particular corruption, unrestrained capitalism, weak control of public opinion on the internet, and dilution of the party’s dominance over society. It thus fell to Xi to offer the decisive leadership needed to steer Communist China into its third historical epoch—from “standing up” under Mao and “getting rich” under Deng, to “becoming strong” under Xi.





NEW TESTAMENT


LIKE ITS COUNTERPARTS in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, China’s Communist Party has a storied history of unhistory. Censors manipulated photographs to emphasize Mao’s presence or excise purged officials. Propagandists revised history texts and museums to diminish, even erase, discussions about policy failures, inconvenient narratives, and alternative pathways. The future is invariably utopian, the past contested ground. “There’s a saying that ‘all history is contemporary history,’ ” says Wu Si, a former chief editor of Yanhuang Chunqiu. “What you say, what you remove, what you retain—these are all decided in accordance with contemporary interests and concerns.”31

Such instrumentalist attitudes toward the past go all the way back to the party’s roots. When the party started commemorating its founding anniversary in the late 1930s, Mao and another revolutionary who’d attended the inaugural congress could only recall that it took place in July 1921, but not the exact dates. Mao picked July 1 as the anniversary, and although researchers later ascertained that the first congress started on July 23, the party has continued the charade, with many Chinese unaware of the discrepancy.32 Even Hu Jintao made that mistake as party chief, declaring in his July 1 speech in 2011 that the party was founded “90 years ago today.”33

Disregard for inconvenient facts aside, the party takes its mythmaking seriously. The creation of party canon is a laborious, painstaking process, often dragging on for years as retired grandees, incumbent officials, and revolutionary families argue over competing narratives. Such squabbling gets most bitter when the party is drafting the most authoritative accounts, and there are none more canonical than the multivolume opus titled The History of the Chinese Communist Party. The first volume, published in 1991 and updated a decade later, chronicles the party’s struggle for power from its founding in 1921 through to the proclamation of the People’s Republic in 1949—a period less encumbered by historical baggage within the party elite, and easily infused with clear heroes and villains.

Work on the second volume, a 1,074-page tome that recounted the three decades up to 1978, was far more fraught. Party historians slogged for sixteen years before the book was published in 2011, including about four years just to complete a first draft.34 They went through more than ten versions over a series of extensive rewrites, and submitted four drafts to the Politburo before getting approval for the final text.35 More than one hundred senior officials and experts reviewed drafts, including Xi, who as leader-in-waiting supervised the project as part of his responsibilities over ideological training.36 Historians say Xi showed keen interest in the book, issuing “clear requests for revisions” and urging them to finish it as soon as possible—a salient concern given that more than a dozen officials and scholars involved died before publication.37 “I never thought it would take so long,” Shi Zhongquan, a senior party historian and an editor on the drafting team, told the Washington Post. “Writing history is not easy.”38

Historians who worked on volume two say they labored most intensely not on the 1966–1976 Cultural Revolution but the decade preceding it, when Mao waged mass campaigns to propel Chinese society toward utopia but wreaked havoc instead. The book tackled some controversial subjects but shied from others. While the text criticized Mao’s 1957–1959 “Anti-Rightist” purge of allegedly pro-capitalism dissidents for persecuting innocents and causing grave societal damage, it elided Deng’s role as one of the campaign’s most energetic enforcers. The book condemned the Great Leap Forward and faulted Mao’s complacency and even recklessness in pursuing social and economic change.39 It avoided the “Great Famine” label but acknowledged that “severe difficulties” during that period caused China’s population to fall by 10 million in 1960 due to food shortage and disease. Even then, this figure came in far short of many other estimates, which range between 15 million and 55 million famine-related deaths.

Party researchers had already done more than a decade’s worth of preparatory work for volume three of the official history by the time the leadership gave the formal go-ahead in 2013, though little was known about the time period the volume would cover and when it might be published.40 Meanwhile, the party focused on crafting condensed accounts for general readers—books that skimmed over controversial events, while reaching wider audiences and making more impact in shaping public consciousness about the past.

Among them is an authoritative account of the party’s first nine decades, a project Xi launched in 2010 to be published in time for the party’s ninety-fifth anniversary.41 As with volume two of the official history, Xi kept a close eye on the drafting of Ninety Years of the Chinese Communist Party. He told party historians to infuse the book with vivid, emotive language that could inspire readers and rouse fervor for the party. The result, published in 2016, raised eyebrows with its diluted criticism of Mao, most notably its omission of references to Mao’s “mistakes” in starting the Cultural Revolution—language that had become routine in authoritative party histories. Officials justified the change as a natural shift toward more objective assessments of the past.

Such changes rankled people who sought a reckoning for their suffering under Mao. For decades, the party had discouraged public discussions on subjects like the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, despite having repudiated those events. Grassroots attempts to broach a fuller accounting often ran into state suppression or descended into shouting matches between liberal voices and Maoist groups. When some former Red Guards started publicly confessing to past misdeeds in 2013, they faced criticism from those who felt their apologies were insincere, and others who accused them of smearing Mao.42 In 2016, when a musical troupe staged a Maoist song-and-dance concert at Beijing’s Great Hall of the People ahead of the Cultural Revolution’s fiftieth anniversary, princelings and ordinary citizens alike roared their disapproval at what they saw as an attempt to gloss over Mao’s errors and build a Xi cult.43

A similar backlash erupted when Xi’s revisionism reached into high-school classrooms. In 2018, the education ministry’s publishing arm introduced a new history textbook that diluted criticism of Mao. Whereas the previous edition, adopted in 2001, had covered the Cultural Revolution in a four-page chapter that said Mao had erred in his judgment, the new edition cut the reference to Mao’s mistakes, truncated the Cultural Revolution content, and squeezed it into another chapter innocuously titled “Arduous Exploration and Achievements in Development.” Social media users called attention to the changes and accused the People’s Education Press of whitewashing history.

The efforts to palliate Mao’s legacy help Xi justify his autocratic style and legitimize Communist rule for the long term. Instead of a history where the party can be seen to err, Xi “would benefit greatly from a new narrative in which the party is seen—almost like a religious body—to be on a path to inevitable success,” says Rana Mitter, a professor and China historian at Oxford University.

Xi imprinted this narrative in a 2021 book titled A Short History of the Chinese Communist Party, an authoritative volume for general audiences that updated earlier editions released in 2001 and 2010. The new text discarded the detailed discussions of Mao’s mistakes and elite power struggles that appeared in previous versions, while playing up China’s economic and diplomatic achievements under Mao.44

Whereas past editions devoted lengthy passages to the Great Leap Forward and concluded that “this bitter historical lesson shouldn’t be forgotten,” this sentence didn’t appear in the 2021 book.45 The Cultural Revolution no longer appeared as a standalone chapter, but was featured as part of a broader segment titled “The Exploration and Tortuous Developments in Building Socialism.” Whereas earlier editions opened the Cultural Revolution chapter by saying the movement “erupted” at Mao’s instigation and inflicted “grave disaster upon the party and the people,” the 2021 version merely said the movement “happened” due to social and historical factors.

Some of Deng’s most famous quotations, which contradict Xi’s domineering style, didn’t appear in the 2021 Short History. Among them was a remark that Deng made in 1989 as he prepared to relinquish his last official leadership post as chairman of the Central Military Commission: “Building a nation’s fate on the reputation of one or two people is very unhealthy and very dangerous.” Deng’s appeal for his compatriots to “hide your light and bide your time,” or keep a low profile while accumulating China’s strengths, was also cut.

Instead the 2021 book featured new chapters that extolled Xi as a decisive leader and visionary statesman. The book devoted more than a quarter of its 531 pages to Xi’s policies and accomplishments, even though his time in power—at that point—accounted for less than a tenth of the party’s century-long existence. For China to continue thriving, the book argued, Xi should be vested with unparalleled power. “Amidst ten thousand majestic mountains, there must be a main peak.”46





THE GOSPEL OF XI


IN THE SPRING OF 2013, a group of prominent princelings and public intellectuals assembled at a Beijing hotel to celebrate the Lunar New Year. It was an annual reunion for these old friends and comrades, many of whom were keen supporters and editors of Yanhuang Chunqiu. Among the attendees was Hu Dehua, a son of former party chief Hu Yaobang, a liberal-minded reformer whose death in 1989 sparked the mass mourning that led to the Tiananmen Square protests. A software engineer turned entrepreneur, the younger Hu had flourished in the economic miracle that followed his father’s passing, launching successful businesses while earning notoriety for airing irreverent views on political affairs. And so it was on this February day, when his straight talk would again irk the powers that be.

“The current leader is younger than me, and at the time, the education we received was very limited. I only studied up till high school, while Xi Jinping is the same as my younger sister, he attended school only till the first year of junior high,” Hu said. “Of course, some people said that I shouldn’t say this, your father was also educated till the first year of junior high. But I want to tell everyone something, my father was someone who really loved reading books.” The youth of the Cultural Revolution, who had limited access to books and therefore did little learning, were now leading China, he said. “I just feel very worried.”47

Within weeks, Xi started raving about his passion for books. “I have many hobbies, the biggest of which is reading. Reading has become a way of life for me,” Xi told reporters in March 2013, after name-checking eight Russian writers—including Chekhov, Dostoevsky, and Tolstoy—whose works he claimed to have read.48 Two months later, Xi charmed Greece’s prime minister by saying he read many works by Greek philosophers during his teenage years.49 When Xi visited France the following year, he boasted about reading Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot, Sartre, and more than a dozen other writers.50 State media feted Xi as an erudite leader, publishing lists of his favorite books and cajoling citizens to emulate his love for learning.

The publicity blitz set tongues wagging across the Yanhuang Chunqiu set. Many among them concluded that Xi’s outlandish claims of literary prowess betrayed deep-seated insecurity about his lack of a formal education—particularly in contrast with Mao, who wrote poetry, and even Jiang Zemin, who spoke several languages and sang and played music alongside foreign leaders. “Xi is not cultured. He was basically just an elementary schooler,” one princeling who has known Xi for decades told me. “He’s very sensitive about that.”51

Mythmaking is a key component of Xi’s push for preeminence. Whereas Mao and Deng won adulation through revolutionary exploits and epoch-defining achievements, Xi took power as a relative unknown and had to build his appeal from scratch. He opted for winning favor through populist deeds and folksy branding, drawing on imagery that recalls Mao and on methods that are more Madison Avenue.

The party humanized Xi with marketing on social media. A visit to a Beijing steamed bun shop in 2013 became a viral hit after fellow diners shared images of Xi queuing and paying for lunch. State media nudged netizens into addressing their leader as “Xi Dada,” using a term of endearment meaning “daddy” or “uncle” from the Xi clan’s home province of Shaanxi. Party-run studios created online videos to play up Xi’s credentials, including a 2013 effort—titled How Leaders Are Made—likening Xi’s ascent to the “training of a kung-fu master,” who proved his mettle by governing more than 150 million people over four decades as a local and regional official.52 Musical odes proliferated online, portraying Xi as a steely man of action, a loving husband, and even an ideal partner for marriage.53 His songstress wife, Peng Liyuan, added star power by keeping up her charity work and joining Xi on diplomatic engagements, departing from the publicity shyness that China’s first ladies had adopted after the Mao era.54

Xi also used traditional techniques more familiar to Leninists than millennials. State media plastered Xi’s name and image across front pages, websites, and television news bulletins. Party presses published hagiographic accounts of his life from the Cultural Revolution through to his stints in local and regional government. Primary-school textbooks describe “Grandpa Xi Jinping” as an avuncular leader who hoped to see China’s children become upstanding citizens, echoing Stalin’s self-styled image as the “father of nations.”55 Xi accumulated titles of authority, becoming the party’s “core,” the military’s commander in chief, and the “people’s leader”—a designation that echoed Mao’s title of “Great Leader.”56 The party rewrote its charter to add an ideological slogan often shortened to “Xi Jinping Thought,” giving his words and ideas the power of holy writ. His lieutenants declared that Xi was empowered to dingyu yizun, or “decide matters as the highest authority,” repurposing a phrase the party once used to warn against unbridled power.57

Media controls intensified as Xi insisted that all Chinese news organizations owed their loyalties to the party.58 He boosted funding for state news outlets, while squelching independent journalism at home with coercion and censorship. Major outlets such as the People’s Daily, Xinhua News Agency, and China Central Television run “central kitchens” that control and create news content for formats ranging from print to video. Journalists must pass exams testing their knowledge of Xi’s policies and Marxist journalistic ideals to secure and renew press credentials.59 Authorities ramped up internet controls, particularly on the WeChat platform, scrubbing anything that cast aspersions on the party and its leader.

The image-building stretched credulity at times. After a 2017 state television documentary aired old interview footage of Xi saying that he, as a rural laborer during the Cultural Revolution, would carry two hundred jin of wheat for ten li—roughly two hundred and twenty pounds over three miles—without switching shoulders, some netizens ridiculed what they saw as an implausible feat.60 Xi’s claims to be a sophisticated reader also drew scorn, given his repeated verbal slips in speeches—mispronouncing words and mixing up phrases—that critics attribute to his disrupted education. During a 2021 video conference with leaders of foreign political parties, Xi inadvertently repeated a passage in his speech, prompting an aide to rush over and set him back on track.61

Xi’s ubiquitous presence has unnerved many Chinese who see shades of a Mao-style dictatorship. But unlike Mao, Xi wants not mass participation but popular support—a source of political capital that he can use to overcome vested interests and bureaucratic inertia. And while Xi enjoys greater popularity than his predecessor, the enthusiasm for his leadership remains a pale shade of the mass veneration that Mao once commanded. At the height of the Mao cult, fanatical students waved “little red books” of the Chairman’s quotations at mass gatherings, Mao statues and paraphernalia were omnipresent across public spaces and inside households, and many people worshipped him like a deity.

The party banned personality cults in 1982, and until Xi, its leaders seldom invoked the Great Helmsman beyond perfunctory references to “Mao Zedong Thought.” While officials insist that Xi isn’t resurrecting a Mao-style cult, the party has gone to great lengths to elevate Xi’s stature at the expense of Deng, the man credited for trying to inoculate China against one-man rule. Deng remained a towering figure well after his death in 1997, revered for enriching the nation and transitioning it toward a more stable leadership. This legacy supplies historical tradition and ideological authority that liberal-minded officials can cite to challenge Xi’s policies—a potent restraint that the current leader has sought to cast aside.

When the party celebrated the fortieth anniversary of Deng’s economic reforms in 2018, the fanfare focused primarily on Xi, even though Deng has long been exalted as the “chief architect” of “reform and opening up.” At the national art museum in Beijing, paintings of Xi and his father were displayed prominently at a fortieth anniversary exhibition, overshadowing artwork depicting Deng and other past leaders—in contrast with how Deng imagery had dominated a thirtieth anniversary exhibition at the same museum in 2008. State media credited Xi’s stints in Fujian and Zhejiang for those provinces’ economic success while omitting Deng, even though Xi—as a provincial official—had cited Deng’s policies as a guide for his own.62

While Xi hasn’t tried to erase or repudiate Deng, the late leader’s supporters have been sensitive to any revisionist attempts to dilute his legacy. Such contestation played out vividly in Shenzhen, where Deng is exalted for his role in transforming a sleepy seaside town into a high-tech metropolis. In December 2017, state-owned conglomerate China Merchants Group opened a museum in the city’s Shekou district—an early test bed for pro-business policies—to pay tribute to the politicians and entrepreneurs who had spearheaded “reform and opening up.” Deng was the most prominent figure featured. Visitors would encounter in the lobby a panoramic frieze depicting Deng’s 1984 visit to Shekou, a tribute that curators described as the museum’s centerpiece. Deng paraphernalia lined the route—photographs, quotations, calligraphy, as well as a chair that he once sat on during his 1984 tour.63

Shenzhen’s propaganda chief attended the opening ceremony, declaring that the museum would become a base for patriotic education. Nearly eighty thousand people visited the facility over the first six months, before it suddenly closed for “upgrading” in June 2018. When it reopened two months later, the Shekou Museum of China’s Reform and Opening-Up was virtually unrecognizable. The Deng frieze was gone, replaced by two video screens showcasing local development and a beige wall adorned with a Xi quotation: “During the forty years of Reform and Opening Up we have created a new road, a good road by bravely daring to pioneer and boldly undertaking self-reform, realizing a great leap from ‘catching up with the times’ to ‘leading the times.’ ”64

While most Deng-related exhibits remained, the museum added a large volume of photographs, texts, and videos to extol Xi and his father’s roles in delivering prosperity to China. Curators removed a border-fence mock-up that highlighted how impoverished Chinese fled to British Hong Kong during the 1970s and 1980s, and replaced it with items showcasing Xi Zhongxun’s role in steering economic reforms as Guangdong party chief from 1978 to 1980. The redesigned exhibition concluded with a section on Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, splashed with some sixteen photos of the incumbent leader. “Comrade Xi Jinping has raised the banner of reform,” read the section’s introductory text. “A new era of ideological liberation is sweeping through China.”65

A museum executive assured me that the redesign, which factored in public and professional feedback, “can stand the test of history.” But some visitors weren’t impressed. “They should respect history,” said Zhao Yanqing, a Shenzhen retiree who saw the museum before and after its revamp. “I feel that we’re reviving the cult of personality from Chairman Mao’s time. This is too dangerous.”

After I described the changes in a Wall Street Journal report in August 2018, overseas Chinese media lit up with discussions about what the pro-Xi revisionism suggested about political intrigue in Beijing. Weeks later, Deng’s eldest son gave a speech laced with oblique criticisms of Xi, particularly his assertive foreign policy. China “should keep a sober mind and know our own place,” Deng Pufang said, echoing his father’s famous calls for humble diplomacy. “We should neither be overbearing nor belittle ourselves.”66

The shadowboxing between the Deng and Xi camps continued at the Shekou museum. Curators tweaked the lobby in September, adding a Deng quotation above Xi’s remarks on the wall and displaying Deng images on the video screens. Further renovations in October installed a new Deng frieze similar to the original sculpture torn down months earlier. Then in late December, the museum said it would be permanently closed to the public from Christmas Day—two days short of its first anniversary. A PhD student who was doing research there told me that a skeletal staff maintained the facility for months after its closure, with access limited to China Merchants staff and corporate guests.67 “Now the exhibition’s mission has been fully accomplished,” a museum spokeswoman told me. “Therefore it is no longer open.”68





HONORING HEROES


EIGHT DECADES AFTER HIS GRANDFATHER was killed during the Chinese civil war, Fang Huaqing vowed to defend his ancestor’s legacy as a Communist hero, one legal complaint at a time. His crusade started in early 2017, when he came across online articles alleging that his grandfather, a celebrated Chinese Red Army commander, was an unscrupulous bandit who kidnapped and murdered innocent people. Incensed by what he calls malicious slander, the younger Fang has brought civil suits against rumormongers, accused party historians of negligence, and campaigned for a new law to protect heroes and martyrs. “A nation that doesn’t uphold its own history has no future,” he said.69

Fang Zhimin occupies a prominent place in party lore, remembered for his exploits as a revolutionary leader who helped set up an early Communist base in the eastern province of Jiangxi before Kuomintang forces captured and executed him in 1935. His writings in captivity, including an essay titled “Lovely China,” prompted Mao to lionize him posthumously as a national hero. In 2005, as Zhejiang party chief, Xi hailed Fang as a martyr and urged party members to honor his example by stepping forward in moments of peril.

Over the years Fang Zhimin has also been dogged by allegations that his troops engaged in kidnappings for ransom. One story blames a military unit from Fang’s 10th Red Army for the 1934 kidnap and murder of an American missionary couple, John and Betty Stam. Contemporary American accounts said Communist “bandits” abducted the Stams and sought $20,000 in ransom—a demand John Stam relayed by letter—before executing the couple. After Kuomintang forces captured Fang in early 1935, a Miss C. McFarlane in Jiangxi wrote to a missionary publication describing Fang as “the Communist leader who was said to be responsible for the massacre of Mr. and Mrs. Stam.”70 Some Chinese sources, however, suggest Fang was marshaling his forces elsewhere and wasn’t present when the Stams were kidnapped and killed.

Born three decades after his grandfather’s death, Fang Huaqing strove to uphold his family’s revolutionary pedigree, becoming deputy director of Jiangxi’s state archives and an adjunct professor at an elite party academy. The online invective against Fang Zhimin angered the younger Fang, who insisted that “my grandfather would never have done such dirty things.” He filed a police report, prompting authorities to punish more than twenty people who had allegedly spread libelous content.71 He argued that such rumormongering was a symptom of inadequate patriotic education, and lodged objections to the promotion of two local party historians, saying they had neglected their duty to defend the honor of martyrs.72 Fang also sued a man and a woman for damages against his grandfather, though he later dropped the case after the pair admitted wrongdoing and apologized in person.73

Still more had to be done to stop “historical nihilism,” said Fang, who joined others in campaigning for new legislation to safeguard the honor of the party’s most exemplary servants. In the spring of 2018, China’s legislature passed a “Heroes and Martyrs Protection Law” that required all of society to “honor, study and defend” party-approved paragons of virtue. It prescribed criminal penalties and civil liabilities for those who defamed such heroes, and mandated police and state agencies overseeing culture, education, media, and the internet to protect and promote the legacy of Chinese heroes. Fang became one of the first litigants to use the new law, suing a man who disparaged his grandfather on an internet forum.74

Heroes and martyrs serve as standard-bearers in Xi’s propaganda campaigns, providing moral moorings and rousing patriotic passions for one-party rule. As part of his pursuit of “law-based governance,” Xi bolstered the party’s legal toolkit for suppressing those who question its history and attack its paragons of virtue. In 2016, a Beijing court ordered a former editor of Yanhuang Chunqiu to apologize for questioning elements of the “Five Heroes of Langya Mountain,” a World War II legend taught to schoolchildren about how five Chinese soldiers battled Japanese forces to save comrades and nearby villagers before leaping off a cliff to avoid capture.75 The following year, China’s legislature approved a preamble to a civil code of law that provides for civil liabilities related to damage done to the “name, image, reputation, and honor” of heroes and martyrs. The 2018 law then delivered the coup de grâce, effectively criminalizing dissent on historical subjects once open to independent inquiry, public debate, and even a degree of satire.

The government has certified and recorded about 2 million heroes and martyrs, with many listed on a government database that features names from the past century or so. Authorities defined martyrdom in 2011, stipulating that deaths must have occurred in the course of public service, but it is less clear what constitutes a hero. Critics say such expansive lists allow the party to curb debates over wide swaths of Chinese history. After China amended its criminal code in 2021 to prescribe up to three years’ jail as punishment for insulting heroes, authorities went after a broad range of targets, including people who allegedly insulted the victims of the 1937 Nanjing massacre perpetrated by Japanese troops; disparaged a Chinese fighter pilot killed in a 2001 midair collision with a U.S. surveillance plane; and spoke ill of Chinese agronomist Yuan Longping, revered in China for his work developing high-yield hybrid rice, after his death in May 2021.76

State protection extends even to cultural symbols not formally covered by the law. The “Yellow River Cantata,” written in 1939 to rouse Chinese resistance against Japanese invaders, had become a comedic trope in recent years, often performed with spoof lyrics for gala dinners, school proms, and online videos. After one such video went viral in early 2018, the daughter of the cantata’s composer lodged complaints, and state media denounced the spoofs as sacrilegious. “Rewriting this signature work that depicts national salvation is clearly an act of historical blasphemy,” a People’s Daily op-ed said.77 Under orders from the culture ministry, video-streaming sites scrubbed some 3,900 videos and 165 songs that spoofed revolutionary anthems.78

Suppression is just half of the formula. Answering Xi’s calls to “tell the party’s stories well,” officials increased funding for academic work that celebrates the party’s past and revamped school curricula to emphasize “revolutionary culture,” such as by recommending Mao’s poetry to students.79 In Jiangxi, known as the cradle of China’s Communist revolution, authorities drafted “red” teaching material for all ages, from nursery rhymes to college lectures. Xiao Fasheng, a party historian and a member of the drafting team, lamented the public’s fading memories of their revolutionary forebears. “I had students telling me they didn’t know who Zhu De was,” he told me, referring to a Chinese marshal regarded as one of the party’s greatest military commanders. “We don’t include enough revolutionary history in textbooks, nor do we put sufficient emphasis on it in the curriculum.”80

Xi also sought to commandeer historical scholarship, launching a new research institute in 2019 and tasking it to repackage the past around his priorities. The Chinese Academy of History operates under the aegis of the party’s Central Propaganda Department and the state-run Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, or CASS—an unusual arrangement that gives party theorists direct control over its output.81 Its inaugural director, Gao Xiang, has been a leading historian at CASS, where he wrote influential works on the Qing dynasty. A mild-mannered scholar fond of invoking historical analogies, Gao ventured into politics in 2016, becoming propaganda chief in Fujian province before his appointment as vice minister at the national cyberspace regulator, where he helped oversee China’s news and social media industries. “In the information age, all sorts of viewpoints flow together like mud and sand, and some erroneous strands of thought have slipped in through the gaps,” including efforts to “distort history and vilify heroes,” Gao said in a 2018 speech.82

Gao brought his experiences in propaganda and internet affairs to the history academy, where he worked to generate popular appeal for their output. He tapped outside talent with an eye for capturing younger audiences, including fresh-faced presenters and a media producer who attracted attention for writing a rap song selling Karl Marx to Chinese millennials. The academy’s social media accounts churn out articles and videos peppered with historical nuggets that celebrate Chinese culture and fan patriotic pride—from promoting new archaeological finds to firing ripostes against Western criticism of China. When Washington pressed Beijing in 2021 over alleged forced labor at Xinjiang cotton farms, the academy published a Weibo post detailing how the American cotton industry was built on slavery. “If cotton is said to be spotlessly white, that would be in China; whereas in the U.S., their cotton has been watered with the blood and tears of black slaves,” said the post, which drew more than 1.5 million views. “That was a sinful period of history, one that good people all over the world should never forget.”83

Academy officials also bust myths that damage the party brand. One persistent rumor has it that Mao’s eldest son was killed in a United Nations air strike during the Korean War after giving away his position by firing up a stove to cook some egg fried rice. In November 2020, the academy marked the seventieth anniversary of Mao Anying’s death with a myth-busting social media post, citing declassified telegrams and eyewitness accounts that indicated he was killed after the enemy detected radio transmissions from his commander’s headquarters. “These rumormongers have tied up Mao Anying with egg fried rice, gravely dwarfing the heroic image of Mao Anying’s brave sacrifice,” said the post, which has drawn more than 2 million views. “Their hearts are vicious.” The academy traced the fried rice story to the 2003 edition of a Chinese military officer’s memoir, but didn’t mention that the book was published by the People’s Liberation Army’s official press.84

The academy has missed its mark at times. In late 2020, its Weibo account sparked online anger with an essay that challenged popular condemnation of Mao’s “Down to the Countryside Movement” that forced millions of urban youth to live and work in rural villages. The essay described the mass rustication as “a great achievement that advanced the development of society,” echoing official portrayals of Xi’s seven years as a “sent-down youth” as a transformative experience that taught him to serve the people. Readers, however, vilified the article as leftist nostalgia and worried that it could signal a shift in official attitudes toward Mao’s radical campaigns. “One flew over the cuckoo’s nest,” one Weibo user wrote in response to the essay, which soon vanished. “This is a very scary signal.”85

The academy also pursues academic work, such as compiling a thirty-volume history of China. It launched a new journal, Historical Review, that features scholarly essays that harness historical arguments in support of Xi’s agenda. The July 2020 issue, for instance, featured two articles attacking Georgetown University history professor James Millward, who has been a vocal critic of China’s forced assimilation campaign against Muslims in Xinjiang. One essay, written by a researcher affiliated with China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, attacked Millward’s writings that characterized Xinjiang, whose name means “new frontier,” as an imperial conquest by the ethnic Manchu-led Qing dynasty—an argument that contradicts Beijing’s claims that Xinjiang “has long been an inseparable part of Chinese territory.”86 In the other article, Chinese historian Zhong Han accused Millward of being a “political opportunist” who fabricated facts and mischaracterized “vocational-education training centers” in Xinjiang as “political-training centers” that indoctrinate Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.87

When I asked Millward what he thought of the essays, he said the criticism distorted his writings and echoed how Beijing often mischaracterizes foreign censure of its human rights record as attempts to challenge China’s sovereignty. “I do know from private conversations with Chinese colleagues that few agree with the kind of approach Zhong Han has taken,” Millward said. “But we all know that some Chinese researchers do it sometimes, or have to do it sometimes, when the political climate demands.”88

Some Chinese historians criticized the academy’s methods as undignified and unserious. “These people are doing this to suck up and win promotion,” said a prominent history professor in Beijing, who declined the academy’s invitation to collaborate on a project. Gao’s efforts paid off in 2022, when he was elevated directly to full membership of the party’s elite Central Committee and appointed CASS president—telling rewards for a scholar-bureaucrat who dismisses conventional historians’ restrained detachment as a dereliction of patriotic duty. “History researchers shouldn’t be cold-eyed observers of times and trends,” Gao wrote. “Historical research must stand atop the commanding heights of our times,” he said, in order to “guide governance and nurture people.”89





SILENCED STUDIES


A LITERATURE PROFESSOR TURNED HISTORIAN, Pei Yiran wrote prolifically against official narratives that cast the Communist Party as sure-handed stewards steering China’s rise. He focused his critiques on the Mao era, drawing on research and his own memories of the Cultural Revolution, when he was forced to work as a construction laborer and schoolteacher in the countryside. His writings appeared in Hong Kong–based political magazines and websites run by overseas Chinese, sometimes with a pen name. “Mao Zedong said ‘serve the people,’ but in practice it was ‘the people serve me,’ ” Pei wrote in a 2016 essay. “Disclosing Mao’s crimes is an act of responsibility toward the nation and history.”90

Chinese authorities eventually took notice. Officials monitored Pei’s communications and asked his colleagues and students to track his activities. His superiors at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics warned him against expressing subversive views, as did government minders who would call him soon after he discussed ideas with magazine editors over email. Such pressure mounted after Xi came to power. In early 2014, two Shanghai police officials visited Pei’s apartment, warning him against crossing bounds of acceptable speech. As they left, one official turned around and said: “Don’t engage in historical nihilism.”91

A frustrated Pei took early retirement, but the interventions continued. In early 2017, university officials pushed him to cancel trips to Hong Kong and the U.S., citing concerns that he could embarrass the party by attending events honoring the victims of Mao’s radical campaigns. For Pei, that was the final affront. Months later, he uprooted himself from Shanghai and moved to America, a country he had never visited, hoping to find a haven for his scholarship.

Under Xi, the party tightened its already short leash on free inquiry, flexing legal and technological muscle to monopolize the right to study the past. Officials scrutinized the production chain for historical knowledge—from research to publication—with greater intensity, and punished those who attempted scholarship beyond state supervision.

State archives were among the first targets. Since Xi took office, Chinese and foreign academics say they have found it increasingly difficult to get access into archives across all levels of government—local, regional, and national—and regardless of the subject or era they wish to study.92 China’s foreign ministry archives, first opened in 2004, slashed the amount of material available for perusal after closing their doors in late 2012. Having once offered access to as many as eighty thousand folders’ worth of documents, the facility reopened the following spring with only about eight thousand folders accessible, mainly comprising telegrams commemorating holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries that were mostly irrelevant for research on China’s international relations.93

State archives require researchers to provide introduction letters from Chinese academic institutions, a protocol that can be used to keep out foreign scholars.94 For many archive officials, demurring on document requests is safer than facilitating research that can yield unflattering accounts of the party, says Thomas Mullaney, a professor of Chinese history at Stanford University, who recalls how a provincial archive told him they didn’t have the documents he was looking for, even though he had read those papers at that archive years earlier.95

Some of the censorship is much subtler and harder to detect. Online academic libraries have been discreetly pruning impolitic content from their digital collections, leaving researchers oblivious about materials going missing. Efforts to digitize collections at many Chinese archives have also made it easier to omit sensitive documents from online access and monitor researchers who use these repositories. Glenn Tiffert, a China historian at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, found what he called systematic omissions of sensitive articles from digitized versions of two Chinese legal journals from the 1950s.96 “The providers who control these servers can silently alter our knowledge base at its source without ever leaving their back offices,” Tiffert wrote. “For censors, the possibilities are mouthwatering.”97

Even foreign academic publishers have been press-ganged into the effort. In 2017, Cambridge University Press quietly acceded to requests from Chinese authorities to remove from its Chinese site more than three hundred articles and book reviews from the British academic journal The China Quarterly, including material that covered sensitive subjects such as the Cultural Revolution and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.98 When the removal was exposed, the backlash prompted CUP to reverse its decision and rebuff a separate request to censor about one hundred articles from an American journal.99 Another major academic publisher, Springer Nature, blocked access in China to at least one thousand articles from two journals—a move the company called a “deeply regrettable” action taken to comply with local regulations.100

New legislation on data security and protecting state secrets effectively reclassified vast swaths of material, including previously declassified documents, which means that scholars making use of such materials may face repercussions for publishing their work or sharing their findings with others.101 In Hong Kong, long a haven for publishing books, memoirs, and papers too sensitive to circulate in mainland China, the availability of such material diminished as state scrutiny prompted independent publishers and booksellers to scale down or cease operation. Many cited ebbing sales due to tighter border checks stopping people from bringing sensitive books in to the mainland, as well as concerns over their personal safety—particularly after Chinese authorities detained five Hong Kong booksellers in 2015, and imposed a far-reaching national security law on the city in 2020.

Censors tightened the prepublication review process for history books, journals, and magazines. Some professors say they have run into stiffer obstacles trying to get articles published in Chinese academic journals. An editor at an independent Beijing-based magazine, Oriental History Review, told me how they spent three years slogging through the government review process for an issue titled “The Night Before the Collapse,” which would feature analyses of the Qing’s demise. Two publishing houses dropped plans to publish that edition, citing political sensitivities, before the magazine secured a third publisher. As of this writing, the magazine hasn’t published new issues since 2020, and its chief editor has switched his focus to other ventures.

Cross-border academic exchanges have suffered. A group of Chinese and foreign academics collaborating on research on Chinese intellectual history have faced interference from government minders, who blocked them from holding meetings on a Chinese university campus and threatened to bug their discussions, two of the researchers involved told me. Local police sometimes got involved, knocking on Chinese scholars’ doors to deliver warnings. These academics switched to meeting in countries such as the U.S., Australia, and Japan, though the Covid-19 pandemic forced them to suspend such trips. “It’s not like we’re trying to uncover the bank accounts of top officials,” one historian lamented. “It feels like the 1980s again,” he said, referring to an era when colleagues and friends were often afraid to speak candidly with one another, for fear of being denounced.102

Such scrutiny drove some aspiring academics to avoid sensitive subjects. “I used to meet many Chinese graduate students working on the history of China’s foreign relations,” says Charles Kraus, a historian at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington. “Now everyone seems to be writing about U.S. foreign policy history.”103 One Chinese PhD student, who was researching China’s diplomatic history at an Asian university, told me he wanted his dissertation published anonymously to avoid repercussions, though the publisher refused. More Chinese scholars are moving abroad to secure more autonomy over their work, one esteemed Chinese historian of the Cold War told me. “I fear a brain drain that may be difficult to reverse.”104

Sun Peidong, an accomplished historian of Maoist China, was among those who decamped for greener pastures. Born in Shaanxi province just weeks after Mao’s death in 1976, Sun says her interest in the Cultural Revolution was first piqued by her parents’ “completely opposing” recollections of that period. Her father came from a poor rural household and led a relatively untroubled life during that decade, thanks to what he called his “good social status.” But her mother suffered persecution as a child of a landowning family, and often prefaced her recollections of that era by saying, “if only the circumstances of my birth weren’t so bad.”105 Puzzled by how such conflicting memories could coexist, Sun decided to figure out for herself “who was right.”106

Sun earned a master’s degree in French literature before switching to sociology, a discipline that taught her how to peer into the lives of ordinary Chinese. After earning doctorates in sociology and law in 2007, she wrote books on Mao-era fashion and parental anxieties over their children’s choice of spouse. Sun found signs of dissent in people’s sartorial decisions. “People’s everyday clothing during that time—a period that has often been regarded as the climax of homogenization and asceticism—became a means of resistance and expression,” Sun wrote. “During the Cultural Revolution people dressed to express resistance, whether intentionally or unintentionally, and to reflect their motivations, social class, gender, and region.” Her work impressed fellow Mao-era specialists, and in 2013, the party chief of the history department at Shanghai’s Fudan University persuaded her to join his team.

Founded in 1905, Fudan ranks among China’s most prestigious universities, well regarded for its relatively liberal atmosphere and excellence in humanities, science, and medicine. Sun’s first two years there went smoothly. She felt free to do research and teach classes as she liked, even on some sensitive historical episodes like the 1957–1959 Anti-Rightist Campaign and the Great Famine. “We were able to have honest discussions as teachers and students,” she recalls. “No one reported me for anything.”107

Matters changed in 2015. The history department party chief retired and his replacement was far more scrupulous in enforcing party diktats. Officials in Beijing blocked her from attending academic conferences in Britain and France. Two Chinese academic journals scrapped plans to publish articles about the Mao era that they had commissioned Sun to write—decisions that, she later learned, were made at the direction of government officials. Since then, Sun hasn’t been able to get any papers published in mainland China, forcing her to seek outlets abroad and write more in English and French.108 “They were giving me a signal,” she says. “I decided that I had to find a new path.”

Sun went overseas, first to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 2016 to spend a year as a visiting scholar at the Harvard-Yenching Institute, before securing a one-year fellowship at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. She was due to start as a visiting scholar at UC Berkeley, but returned to Fudan in 2018 at the behest of her former boss, who had recruited her hoping that she would take on his mantle in studying the Mao era. “I went back to honor a promise,” she says.109

This time, having tasted academic freedom on American campuses, Sun found the strictures at home even more suffocating. By then Fudan was the only university in mainland China still offering courses on the Cultural Revolution, and even that status seemed under threat. Superiors asked Sun to omit references to the “Mao Zedong Era” in course titles, revise teaching materials, and amend reading lists to include texts published in mainland China—which meant they were already screened by party censors.110 Even when administrators approved certain foreign texts, faculty and students were expected to treat them with a critical stance and a teacher shouldn’t validate the authors’ perspectives.111

When Sun resisted these demands, the pressure grew in other ways. Inspectors conducted spot checks on her classes, and students seemed less willing than ever to express their views. The scrutiny grew so intense that Sun stopped speaking to students inside her office. Instead they would leave their cellphones behind and go for walks, chatting in open spaces to keep any prying ears at bay. “We weren’t discussing anything political, just academic stuff,” Sun says. “But the fact that we felt we had to take such precautions showed how the atmosphere on campus had changed.”112

In early 2019, some students reported Sun for allegedly making politically incorrect remarks and fanning subversion in her classes and on social media. Her accusers posted denunciations and printouts of her Weibo posts on her office door—echoing the “big-character posters” that Red Guards used for accusing class enemies and bourgeois elements during the Cultural Revolution.113 Abusive and threatening comments against Sun and her family swamped her Weibo account.

But Sun refused to be cowed. In December 2019, when Fudan became one of three universities that revised their charters to remove references to academic independence and freedom of thought, Sun spoke out in protest, telling foreign media that the change dovetailed with the party’s efforts to restrict free inquiry.114 Sun’s bosses told her to write a self-criticism, but she refused, as she had decided to quit Fudan and leave China. In her resignation letter, Sun skipped the usual expressions of gratitude to the university and her superiors. “I am thankful to the six years I spent working at Fudan’s history department for giving me such an unforgettable experience,” she wrote.115

Sun left China in February 2020. She returned to her alma mater in Paris, Sciences Po, to work on her books, before moving to Cornell University the following year to become an associate professor of history. Still Sun’s minders back home kept tabs on her, warning that she could never escape the party’s clutches. A former university classmate, whom Sun hadn’t spoken to in two decades, called to remind her that she still had family back home and that she should watch her words. Sun acknowledges that she may never be able to return to China or see her parents again—a heavy price, but one she felt she had to pay. “I just want to simply be a scholar. I want to write whatever I wish to write and produce better research,” she says. “If I can’t do that in one place, I’ll just go somewhere else—it’s that simple.”116

Historians who remain in China continue finding ways to do scholarship. Some devote themselves to translation work and technical analysis, such as verifying the provenance of documents, without explicitly drawing conclusions that could contradict the party line. Others focus on local issues and avoid subjects that pertain directly to the central government, which are more likely to attract state scrutiny. For controversial subjects, some scholars are “writing for the desk drawer,” hoping that the political climate may one day improve sufficiently to allow publication.117 Other researchers continue circulating their work through underground channels, such as samizdat books and magazines.

Foreign researchers too are getting creative. Some scholars are reanalyzing papers in their existing collections, to, as one professor put it, “squeeze more juice out of the lemons they have.” More historians have turned toward “garbology,” the acquiring of so-called “garbage” documents, pamphlets, letters, and other materials from flea markets, online booksellers, and other dealers. The practice, once disdained as lacking scholarly rigor, has gained currency as a show of resourcefulness, though challenges remain in proving the authenticity and provenance of materials.118 Academics have started sharing papers and donating them to university libraries so that fellow researchers can read them. David Ownby, a historian at the University of Montreal, teamed up with scholars in China to translate writings by influential Chinese thinkers into English and host them on his website—Reading the China Dream—as an intellectual public service.119

“People are keeping their heads down and continuing to do what they can,” says Cheek of the University of British Columbia. “Xi’s bonfire hasn’t sucked out all the oxygen yet.”120
