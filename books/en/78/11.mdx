EPIGRAPH


1 Author’s translation of《临江仙·滚滚长江东逝水》[“Immortal by the River · The Yangtze’s Roaring Waters Roll Ever Eastward”]. Written by Ming dynasty poet Yang Shen, the verse was later added as an epigraph to the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Qing dynasty editors. A son of a top Ming official, Yang won the title of zhuangyuan by achieving the best score in imperial examinations. But he was later exiled for his role in the “Great Rites Controversy,” during which Yang’s father led the opposition against the Jiajing emperor’s decision to depart from prevailing succession protocols. Jiajing, who succeeded his heirless cousin, declined to ritually honor his late uncle—the Hongzhi emperor—as his imperial father, and instead declared his own father an emperor posthumously. The full verse and other translations are available here: Wang Xiaohui, “青山依旧在 几度夕阳红⸺《三国演义》英译品读（一）[But the Lush Hills Remain, and the Scarlet Sunsets Repeat—Appreciating English Translations of Romance of the Three Kingdoms (Part One)],” China.org.cn, April 30, 2020, http://www.china.org.cn/chinese/2020-04/30/content_75994782.htm

Mao Zedong concluded the Communist Party’s 7th National Congress in 1945 with a speech that recounted “Foolish Old Man Moves Mountains.” The story tells of an old man in northern China, known as “Yugong” or Foolish Old Man, whose house faced two great peaks, Taihang and Wangwu, that blocked his way. Yugong summoned his sons to dig and move the mountains, an effort that a wise old man dismissed as hopelessly misguided. Yugong was undeterred, insisting that his descendants would carry on the task long after his death, until the mountains were moved. Yugong’s determination moved God, who tasked two giants to carry the mountains away. In his 1945 speech, Mao couched the fable as analogous to the challenges confronting the Chinese people, who were weighed down by the two mountains of imperialism and feudalism. The Chinese Communist Party, Mao said, had made up its mind to dig up these two mountains, and through perseverance win the hearts of the Chinese people, who would then dig together with the party and clear the mountains away.

15 Official biographies of Xi Jinping state that he was born in June 1953, in keeping with the party’s standard practice of not disclosing officials’ precise birth dates. Even so, Xi’s birth date was reported by Chinese media in 2010, after Laotian leaders marked Xi’s birthday on June 15, while he was visiting the Southeast Asian country as China’s vice president. Other foreign leaders, including Russian president Vladimir Putin, have wished Xi happy birthday on June 15. Xuexi Xiaozu, a WeChat account run by the People’s Daily newspaper, has reported that Xi’s birthday coincided with China’s Dragon Boat Festival, celebrated annually on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, which in 1953 fell on June 15.

Daniel Golden, a veteran American journalist, named Yi as “the professor” in a 2017 book, Spy Schools—an identification that Yi didn’t dispute. Yi didn’t respond to my requests for comment, while Marietta College, where Yi worked as an academic for more than three decades before retiring in 2021, declined to comment.
