“The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been.”

—Opening line in the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms


“To realize the China Dream… we must focus on forging a common consciousness of the Chinese nation.”

—Xi Jinping



Wang Fenghe, a former soldier who now works in construction, spent decades chasing jobs across China to supplement the meager takings from his tiny farm. Whenever he is back home in rural Inner Mongolia, a vast stretch of grassland and desert in the country’s northeast, he often spends his evenings peering into the future of an island he has never visited, roughly 110 miles off China’s southeast coast and claimed by the Communist government in Beijing as a province awaiting liberation—the self-governing democracy of Taiwan.

Wang would tune in after dinner to a nightly news program, Across the Strait, for a half-hour update on Taiwan affairs, produced by state broadcaster China Central Television to propagate the party’s messaging on its perennial quest to take over the island. Invoking the martial language he has imbibed since his soldiering days, Wang dismisses “Taiwan independence” as a pipe dream and denounces its advocates as separatists. “Taiwan belongs to China,” Wang told me one wintry evening as we watched the program in his small farmhouse. “There’s no question that we’ll recover it one day.”

By his own admission, Wang knows little of politics and strategic affairs. Born in 1955, he joined his local farming collective after finishing elementary school, before enlisting, aged nineteen, in the People’s Liberation Army to “defend the homeland and protect Chairman Mao.” As an infantry radioman, he took part in relief efforts after the devastating Tangshan earthquake of 1976 but saw no combat before being demobilized the following year. He joined a generation of laborers who streamed out of the countryside to build post-Mao China, constructing everything from factories to luxury hotels but never earning enough to avoid working well into their twilight years. Though Wang enjoyed little of the prosperity he helped create, he voices nothing but gratitude for the Communist Party. Posters of Mao and Xi adorn his bedroom walls. “Chairman Xi is a great leader,” says Wang, citing Xi’s efforts to fight corruption, overhaul the military, and recover the motherland’s lost territories. “With him in charge, the great rejuvenation is at hand.”

An ardent nationalist, Xi has made no secret of his most treasured ambition: a unified Chinese nation. It is a simple yet compelling idea, one that sits at the heart of his China Dream, and fires the imagination of ordinary Chinese in ways that no economic targets or highfalutin slogans can. It invokes grievances suffered during the “century of humiliation,” and promises recovery of the nation’s sullied honor. It rouses patriotic fervor into a reservoir of legitimacy for Xi, who can cement his legacy as one of China’s most consequential leaders—if he achieves the party’s most sacred mission.

Xi’s vision of a Chinese renaissance goes beyond mere geography. Through speeches and directives, he has outlined ambitions to build a more centralized state buttressed by a singular identity—a “common consciousness” that unites China’s 1.4 billion people. This means stronger central control over areas that notionally enjoy some self-rule, from the former colonies of Hong Kong and Macau to ethnicity-based “autonomous regions” such as Tibet and Xinjiang.1 It requires a national lingua franca, binding all fifty-six officially recognized ethnic groups with a sense of shared culture, heritage, and purpose centered on the Han Chinese majority. “Xi believes the party must actively forge a shared worldview among its people—whether they be Han, Uyghur, Tibetan, Mongolian, Hong Kongese, or Taiwanese—and if they are not successful, then instability will reign and the country could fall apart,” says James Leibold, a professor at Australia’s La Trobe University who studies China’s ethnic policies.2

History dealt Xi a complex hand when he took power in 2012. While the party had largely suppressed ethnic strife in borderlands like Tibet and Inner Mongolia, separatist sentiment still simmered in Xinjiang, the Central Asian frontier region home to millions of ethnic Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities, and where violent attacks against symbols of party authority continued. The former British colony of Hong Kong remained a hotbed of anti-Communist activism well after its return to Chinese control in 1997. Taiwan, the holy grail sought by every Chinese leader since Mao, continued to elude the party’s grasp despite decades of pressure and persuasion.

Even so, Xi struck confident tones when expounding on his vision. “To realize the China Dream, we must consolidate China’s power—that is the strength from the great unity of all ethnic groups in China,” he said in his inaugural speech as president in 2013. “All the nation’s ethnic groups must keep their mission firmly in mind, direct their thoughts and actions toward one place, and use the wisdom and strength of 1.3 billion people to assemble an invincible and majestic force.”3

Such resolve only hardened in 2014, when extremist violence and social unrest struck directly at Xi’s vision of national unity. Deadly acts of terror attributed to Uyghur separatists rocked China, including a mass slashing at a train station in the country’s southwest and a knife-and-bomb attack that hit Xinjiang’s capital just as Xi wrapped up a tour there. In Taiwan, students who resented Beijing’s growing economic clout led mass demonstrations that undermined a trade pact with the mainland and galvanized support for a political party that advocated a Taiwanese identity separate from China. Hong Kong dealt another blow to the Chinese leadership months later, when protesters staged a seventy-nine-day street occupation to rebuff a proposal to let the city’s residents elect their top official from a pool of Beijing-approved candidates.

Xi responded with force on every front. In Xinjiang, the party directed repressive policing and forced-assimilation programs against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities that foreign researchers and United Nations experts assessed as rife with human rights abuses. After mass protests rocked Hong Kong in 2019, authorities imposed a broad national security law on the city, rounded up scores of opposition politicians, activists, and independent journalists, and injected nationalist propaganda into local schools. Beijing pressured Taipei by poaching its diplomatic partners, harassing its military with patrols and combat drills, and restricting trade and travel links with the island. Even in regions with no recent history of ethnic strife, the party suppressed minority languages and intensified patriotic education that celebrated Han culture as the core of a Chinese national identity.

Xi’s strident style appears to have yielded results, silencing dissent and enforcing order in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. But the battle over hearts and minds is far from over. Resentment still simmers among Uyghurs and Hong Kongers. Efforts to propagate Mandarin Chinese among non-Han ethnic groups has fueled bitterness among communities that the party has long regarded as model minorities. The saber-rattling against Taiwan has stoked anti-China sentiment among the island’s more than 23 million people, while prompting the United States and other democracies to strengthen ties with Taipei. Xi’s efforts to modernize the military and apply its power in territorial disputes have inflamed regional tensions and raised the specter of armed conflict.

The backlash notwithstanding, Xi has shown no signs of letting up. Having staked his legitimacy on the promise of forging a strong and unified China, Xi has to deliver.





ENGINEERING SOULS


“CHINA IS A CIVILIZATION PRETENDING to be a state,” Lucian Pye, the renowned American sinologist, once wrote. “In Western terms the China of today is as if the Europe of the Roman Empire and of Charlemagne had lasted until this day and were now trying to function as a single nation-state.”4 Pye’s observations have since become a truism of sorts, cited by academics and journalists who believe that China possesses unique historical and cultural traditions that defy easy comprehension through Western liberal lenses. Others argue the opposite, saying the Communist Party has appropriated the trappings of an ancient civilization to justify its authoritarian rule. “Looking from another angle, we can say that today’s China is actually a nation-state masquerading as a civilizational empire,” wrote Xu Jilin, a respected historian at Shanghai’s East China Normal University. “Because it uses the methods of the nation-state to govern a massive empire.”5

Whether they believe China constitutes a “civilization state,” most scholars agree that the modern concepts of nationalism and the nation-state are relatively new to the country. Revolutionaries and thinkers like Sun Yat-sen and Liang Qichao were among the first to advocate notions of a “Chinese nation,” during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, drawing upon notions of ethnicity, culture, and Westphalian sovereignty. It was a departure from the worldview professed by most Chinese rulers since antiquity, that they were ordained by divine right to govern tianxia, or “all under heaven,” an amorphous concept that broadly refers to the known human world and the universal order.

Sun, in trying to establish a Chinese republic, stoked anger against the Qing’s ethnic Manchu rulers and foreign imperialists, while advocating an ethnocentric nationalism whereby the Han majority would assimilate minority groups to forge a cohesive nation.6 Chiang Kai-shek pushed his own unifying ideology after taking power, launching the “New Life Movement” in the 1930s to promote conservative Confucian-style morality and repel foreign influences that he blamed for corrupting Chinese society.7

Mao too stoked patriotism for nation-building. During the early years of the People’s Republic, the Communist Party fanned anger against Western imperialism, castigated capitalist decadence, and waged war against “U.S. aggression” toward North Korea. Such sentiment helped Mao mobilize support for his radical land reforms and political purges.8 Students studied “Mao Zedong Thought,” recited the Great Leader’s quotations, and sang revolutionary songs lauding his achievements in creating a “new China.”

Under Deng Xiaoping, the party focused on purging Mao’s radical influence and promoting development. Officials set aside socialist ideology and nativist nationalism to open up China’s economy and pursue trade with the West. But the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests stunned party leaders, who grappled with the loss of faith in Marxism-Leninism and sought new ways to inspire loyalty to Communist rule. Some prominent scholars argued that nationalism was the only option. “In an era where ideological confrontation no longer dominates the world, the functions of political integration and cohesion that nationalism provides cannot be replaced by other ideologies,” wrote Xiao Gongqin, a Chinese historian and an influential conservative.9

The party paid heed. It ramped up patriotic education in the early 1990s, revising the syllabus in ways that rendered the party’s fortunes inseparable from those of the Chinese nation. Whereas older history textbooks often recounted the party’s successes in waging class struggle and fighting Chiang’s Kuomintang, newer course books focused more on how pre-1949 China was bullied by foreign imperialists, from Britain in the 1840s to Japan during the 1930s and 1940s.10 New museums and monuments, which the party calls “patriotic education sites,” sprung up across the country to commemorate the Communist revolution and the war against Japan.11 The appeal to a national identity was also steeped in ethnic chauvinism, one where the Han majority—who account for more than 90 percent of a highly homogeneous society—are celebrated as the most advanced and prosperous race.

Such efforts yielded mixed results. Surveys suggested that young Chinese generally regarded patriotic education as clumsy and remained politically apathetic, despite an uptick in student-led protests against perceived foreign criticism of their country.12 Many continued harboring sympathies toward liberal views and hoped to study and work in the West.13 Harvard professor Alastair Iain Johnston argued in a 2017 paper that younger Chinese tended to be less nationalistic than older citizens, citing survey data dating back to the late 1990s.14

Xi, who had lamented how China’s economic boom loosened its spiritual moorings and weakened social cohesion, doubled down on patriotic education after taking office. His administration circulated a directive, known as Document Number 9, that demanded greater vigilance against Western ideas that could subvert the party—including liberal notions of human rights, a free press, and an independent judiciary.15 Hoping to instill pride in what the party proclaims as a five-thousand-year civilization, he promoted Confucius and other classical Chinese thinkers that Mao had once condemned as feudal relics.16 In 2016, Xi appointed as education minister a former Central Party School vice president who pushed for more patriotic teaching. “Teachers are the engineers of the human soul,” Xi told a party conference on education in 2018, borrowing a metaphor that Stalin used to praise writers for shaping the public consciousness.17 Educators, Xi said, must ensure that “the spirit of patriotism takes root in the hearts of students, and educate and guide students to love and support the Chinese Communist Party.”

Beijing centralized control over teaching materials, particularly those related to national sovereignty, ethnicity, and religion, reversing a policy that allowed provincial governments to choose their own textbooks. The government barred elementary and secondary schools from using foreign textbooks, and instead promoted literature espousing Xi’s political philosophy.18 Officials rewrote curricula to amplify nationalistic narratives, such as by adding six years to the official length of China’s “war of resistance against Japanese aggression,” which now spanned fourteen years, from 1931 to 1945, instead of eight years from 1937.19

Schools screened patriotic films and arranged field trips to revolutionary landmarks, while teachers were told to give poor grades to students who voiced unapproved views in essays, such as portraying the government’s handling of Covid-19 in unfavorable terms.20 Authorities encouraged educators to instill culturally conservative values, including a sense of “masculinity” among boys and respect for the military. A kindergarten in the southern city of Guangzhou arranged a ten-day mock boot camp for its pupils, who were taught by PLA personnel to dress in military fatigues, march and perform salutes, sing revolutionary songs, and practice combat drills with toy rifles and rocket launchers.21

The internet became a key battleground for hearts and minds. State agencies ran about a quarter-million accounts on three major Chinese social-media platforms as of 2020, and academics estimate that millions of Chinese web users posting pro-party content are paid to do so by the government or are officials themselves.22 Internet regulators imposed new rules encouraging posts that promote “Xi Jinping Thought” and requiring platforms to adjust their algorithms to favor government and state media content. The party’s youth wing, the Communist Youth League, became a leading purveyor of patriotic videos for tens of millions of followers on China’s most popular streaming platforms. Many online influencers and live-streamers, part of a swelling industry worth tens of billions of dollars, share nationalistic content to attract attention, sell advertising and products, and earn gifts from fans.23

Such fervor can take dark turns. Online mobs harass people who criticize the party or allegedly show disloyalty to China, often hounding them into hiding or even forcing them out of their jobs.24 Chinese writer Fang Fang, who chronicled how Covid-19 battered her home city of Wuhan, the pandemic’s first epicenter, found herself barracked on social media and had rocks thrown into her home by people who resented her online writings that criticized the government’s initial mishandling of the coronavirus.25 A professor who spoke up for Fang Fang was suspended by her university after netizens accused her of being a Japan loyalist and supporter of Hong Kong independence—allegations that she denied.26

For all the party’s success online, however, officials have struggled to win over minority groups in China’s far-flung borderlands, where defiance against the party and the Han majority runs deep. Among them, Xinjiang posed the stiffest challenge, and it is there where Xi demanded compliance in the most draconian ways.





BORDERLANDS


ON THE EVENING OF MARCH 1, 2014, a group of knife-wielding militants stormed through a railway station in China’s southwestern city of Kunming, slashing thirty-one people to death and injuring more than a hundred and forty others. The following month, as Xi Jinping wrapped up a four-day tour of Xinjiang, two attackers carried out a suicide bombing at a train station in the regional capital of Urumqi, killing one bystander and injuring about eighty people. Another bomb attack ravaged an Urumqi market weeks later, killing at least thirty-nine people and wounding more than ninety.

The attacks stunned China, a dramatic escalation in Xinjiang’s long history of unrest and periodic violence carried out by some militant members of the region’s Uyghur community. Xi pledged an iron-fisted response, declaring a “people’s war” against religious extremism and separatist violence. “The methods that our comrades have at hand are too primitive,” Xi said during his trip in Urumqi, according to internal party documents later leaked to the New York Times. “We must be as harsh as them,” he said, “and show absolutely no mercy.”27

Xi has since directed a withering security and assimilation campaign across Xinjiang, creating what some experts describe as a system of near-totalitarian control. In internal speeches later leaked to foreign media and researchers, the Chinese leader warned about the dangers of religious influence and unemployment among minority groups in Xinjiang, and stressed the importance of “population proportion,” or the balance between Han Chinese and minorities.28 Xi’s ultimate goal, experts say, is to entrench Han dominance over a restive frontier region where resistance against Beijing has simmered ever since the Qing empire first conquered the territory during the eighteenth century.

Officially, the party celebrates ethnic diversity and harmony across China’s fifty-five minority groups. They include traditionally nomadic Tibetans and Mongols, Turkic Muslims, and communities with cultural ties to Southeast Asia, among others, each with their own languages, beliefs, and customs. During the Mao era, the party set up a system of autonomous regions, prefectures, and counties where ethnic minorities took senior posts in local governments, received generous state investments, and were allowed to keep tax revenues for local use. China’s constitution provides minorities with the right to speak their own languages and practice their cultures and religions. Members of minority groups were also given bonus points in China’s ultracompetitive college entrance examinations and exempted from the one-child policy, the controversial population-control program that lasted three and a half decades before it was officially discontinued in 2016.

Xinjiang has been a focal point for such policies since the early years of the People’s Republic. Some 12 million Uyghurs live in this swath of desert and mountains abutting Central Asia that they regard as their homeland, alongside large numbers of Han Chinese and smaller communities of Kazakhs, Kyrgyzs, and other minorities. Xinjiang means “new frontier,” so named by the Qing dynasty when it incorporated the region as a province in the nineteenth century. During the 1930s and 1940s, Uyghur nationalists twice established short-lived East Turkestan republics in the area, the second of which was backed by the Soviet Union. The PLA entered Xinjiang in 1949 and Beijing designated it as an autonomous region six years later—a symbolic gesture given that Han officials held overall control.

Separatist sentiment simmered among Uyghurs, who in the early 1950s accounted for 75 percent of Xinjiang’s population compared to 6 percent Han.29 The government encouraged large numbers of Han Chinese to migrate to Xinjiang over subsequent decades, and by 2000, only about 46 percent of the population were Uyghur, while the Han made up close to 40 percent.30 Widening economic disparities between the two communities fueled Uyghur unrest against what they saw as ethnic discrimination and exploitation by Han Chinese, kicking off a cycle of anti-party violence and state repression. Chinese officials blamed Islamic extremism and separatist agitation. Foreign historians and Uyghur activists pointed to the party’s heavy-handed policing, strict curbs on religious activity, and preferential policies for Han and other non-Uyghur settlers.

Beijing showed spells of relative tolerance. Xi’s father, Xi Zhongxun, often advocated a softer touch in ethnic policy while serving as a senior official. During the 1950s, the elder Xi argued for coopting local Muslim leaders in China’s northwest, and criticized cadres who derided local customs as backward “feudal” practices.31 When protests broke out in Xinjiang’s Kashgar city in the early 1980s, he urged officials to use peaceful means to pacify the unrest and avoid mass persecutions that could inflame tensions.32 “The more that our policies are tight and inflexible, the more that in practical terms religion is suppressed, things run counter to one’s wishes, the exact opposite result occurs,” the elder Xi said in 1985.33

Deadly riots that rocked Tibet in 2008 and Xinjiang in 2009 forced Beijing to rethink its ethnic policies. Chauvinistic sentiment festered among Han Chinese who saw the unrest as a sign of ingratitude among minorities who benefited from affirmative action and China’s prosperity. Academics advocating a more forceful approach to assimilating minorities gained influence in Beijing. They believed the prevailing approach in ethnic affairs would lead to a Soviet-style dissolution of the People’s Republic, as minority groups received rights and treatment that could strengthen ethnic identities while undermining national unity.

Hu Angang, a prominent Tsinghua University economist, and Hu Lianhe, a party researcher and specialist in counterterrorism and ethnic policy, were among the leading proponents of more aggressive assimilation. The two Hus, who aren’t related, wrote an influential paper in 2011 urging the party to replace its outmoded methods with a “second generation of ethnic policy.” Citing the Soviet collapse as a lesson and the American cultural “melting pot” as a model, the pair argued that China should de-emphasize senses of belonging to disparate ethnic identities and instead seek to “intensify the sense of Chinese national identity.” They singled out Xinjiang as an example where a “strong ethnic consciousness” and a “weak sense of belonging to the Chinese nation” had allowed separatism to foment.34

Xi’s accession in 2012 also coincided with a generational shift among officials overseeing ethnic affairs. Whereas older cohorts often sympathized with minority communities, understood their culture, and spoke their languages, many younger officials lacked experience in minority regions, had received a secular education, and equated modernity with secularism, according to Max Oidtmann, a historian at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, who studies China’s ethnic minorities. The new generation of ethnic affairs specialists “have much greater faith in the potential for government policy to radically transform social and ideological conditions, and firmly believe in the underlying unity of the Chinese people,” Oidtmann says. “It is time, in their view, for peasants, religious folk, and minorities to get with the program, or else.”35

Within weeks of his 2014 trip to Xinjiang, Xi committed to a hard-line approach to quash the rising violence. He declared that the party’s ethnic policies would enter a new phase. Discarding past promises of regional autonomy, officials would focus instead on forging a “common consciousness of the Chinese nation.”36

Xi’s directives led to a far-reaching campaign of ethnic assimilation in Xinjiang. Authorities deployed more police and paramilitary forces across urban centers, tightened restrictions on Islamic customs and practices, and ran intrusive “homestay” programs whereby Han Chinese cadres visited Muslim families and lived with them for several days.37 Some of the harshest measures emerged after Chen Quanguo, the veteran regional administrator, became Xinjiang’s party boss in the summer of 2016, fresh from his five-year stint suppressing ethnic unrest in Tibet.38 Bringing in techniques honed over his decades managing social tensions, Chen unleashed the party’s coercive powers upon Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities, targeting them with mass detentions, political indoctrination, and strict birth controls, as well as policies that resulted in forced labor and family separations.

Chen had help from local experts too. In December 2016, a party-run publisher in Xinjiang released what state media described as the region’s first academic monograph on “deradicalization” strategies.39 Written by Zhu Zhijie, director of a research institute affiliated with Xinjiang’s prison administration bureau, the roughly four-hundred-page book recommended promoting loyalty to the party through ideological education and “Chinese cultural infiltration,” such as by melding Han traditions with local Islamic customs. “Radicalized attitudes can be changed through counter-brainwashing,” Zhu wrote. He proposed that people expressing extremist thoughts and behavior be put through “compulsory correctional methods,” while those showing severe symptoms should undergo vigorous indoctrination at “closed-off educational facilities,” where they would be taught patriotism and Chinese socialism.40

Central-government experts praised Zhu for producing “innovative” research with “important practical significance.” While some of his ideas were in use already, Chen ramped up their implementation. His administration blanketed Xinjiang with digital surveillance tools and internment camps for ethnic minorities. Muslim residents were threatened with detention or sent to camps for engaging in routine religious practices such as praying daily and owning a Quran. Officials also demolished Uyghur neighborhoods and tore down thousands of mosques and other religious sites. Some Uyghurs who traveled overseas or contacted relatives abroad were thrown into detention camps or even jailed.41 Some experts estimated that Xinjiang authorities sent more than a million people into mass detention facilities that Chinese officials euphemistically described as “vocational training centers,” where inmates faced political indoctrination that forced them to praise the Communist Party and study Xi Jinping’s policies.42

Human rights advocates and Western officials have denounced the party’s policies in Xinjiang, with some accusing Beijing of committing cultural genocide against Uyghurs. The United Nations human rights agency spent years reviewing the allegations, and after a protracted process issued a report in August 2022 assessing that serious rights abuses have taken placed in Xinjiang, and that Chinese authorities there may have committed “crimes against humanity.”43

Beijing vehemently denies committing any rights violations in Xinjiang, portraying its policies there as benign efforts to improve the lives of ethnic minorities. They boast of restoring stability to a once-restive region, saying no violent act of terror has taken place there since the end of 2016. “Practice has proven that the party’s strategy for governing Xinjiang in the new era is completely correct, and must be sustained for the long term,” Xi told party officials in 2020. The next step, he said, is to ensure the “common consciousness of the Chinese nation takes root deep inside people’s hearts.”44 Accordingly, Beijing has since assigned Xinjiang a new party chief who brought a greater focus on economic development, and dialed back some of the region’s harshest security and assimilation programs—though ethnic minorities there remain under close scrutiny.45

The party also tightened ethnic policy across the board. In 2018, lawmakers revised China’s constitution to add references to the “Chinese nation,” a change some scholars praised as a marker of the party’s efforts to forge a singular national identity.46 Officials stepped up efforts to standardize school curricula, promote inter-ethnic cultural exchanges, and encourage more Han Chinese to work in minority regions—even though such policies had irked many Tibetans and Uyghurs. Some provincial governments announced plans to phase out affirmative action in college entrance exams, meaning ethnic minorities would no longer get bonus points.47 Officials increasingly refer to standard Mandarin as guoyu, or the “national language,” when encouraging ethnic minorities to learn China’s lingua franca—departing from a decades-old policy of referring to Mandarin as putonghua, or “common tongue,” to avoid the impression of forcing minorities to adopt Han language.48

In Inner Mongolia, where many ethnic Mongols have embraced integration into Chinese society despite lingering resentment over the influx of Han settlers and a deadly anti-Mongol purge during the Cultural Revolution, residents rallied against a 2020 government decision to change the language of instruction in some school classes from Mongolian to Mandarin. Many Mongols believed the shift would dilute their culture, and thousands of people protested, urging authorities to reverse plans to phase out local history, literature, and ethnic textbooks in favor of nationally standardized texts.49

In Tibet, long subjected to tough policing and social controls, authorities passed new regulations to promote patriotism, imposed new curbs on Tibetan religion, education, and language, and introduced “military-style” vocational training for rural Tibetans. In the western province of Gansu, home to large populations of Muslim minorities, authorities shut down an Arabic-language school for underprivileged students in 2018, citing its lack of proper approval, even though it had operated for more than three decades with support from local officials. The decision disturbed some locals, who say it targeted Muslims who learned Arabic as part of their religious studies.50

The campaign also left visible marks in Ningxia, an autonomous region for Hui Muslims, an ethnic group composed mainly of descendants of Middle Easterners, Central Asians, and Chinese, and a community that Beijing has long regarded as a well-assimilated model minority. Authorities in the regional capital of Yinchuan refurbished a large plaza in the city center known as the “China-Arab Axis” to remove Islamic iconography of Arabic origin—such as domes and crescent-moon sculptures—and replace them with generic Chinese designs. The area was also renamed “Unity Road,” just two years after its construction to showcase Ningxia’s strategic location astride the ancient Silk Road.51

By 2020, Xi had dispensed with any pretense of minority autonomy, installing a Han Chinese official as head of the government body overseeing ethnic affairs—the first time since the 1950s that a non-minority person was in charge of the agency.52 In his first publicized remarks, the new director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission reiterated Xi’s demands for forging a “common consciousness” through better education and propaganda.53 “The party leadership reveals that it does not believe that economic growth alone resolves political contradictions or ethnic resentments,” says Oidtmann, the Munich-based historian. Instead Xi has inherited Mao’s conviction, Oidtmann says, that “ideological transformation will solve political and economic problems.”54





THE SECOND HANDOVER


HONG KONG HAS LONG BEEN a useful contradiction for the Communist Party. During the Chinese civil war, the British colony sat beyond the reach of Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang government, giving Mao’s revolutionaries a platform for raising funds and maintaining links with overseas sponsors. Party leaders decided against taking Hong Kong as they seized power on the mainland in 1949, worrying that an invasion could prompt Western powers to intervene militarily.55

The Communist government insisted that Hong Kong belonged to China and would be recovered one day. In the meantime, Beijing was content to use the city as a base for earning foreign exchange, developing trade ties, gathering intelligence, and even as leverage over Britain, by issuing implicit threats to destabilize or seize the colony.56 With the People’s Republic off-limits to most Westerners during the Mao years, Hong Kong also became a popular listening post for China watchers of all stripes—diplomats, journalists, spies, and businesspeople—who tapped into local grapevines that stretched as far as Beijing.57 Deng Xiaoping’s market-opening reforms boosted the city’s economic value, with foreign businesses tapping Hong Kong as a conduit into a fast-growing mainland economy.

Though Mao, according to a Chinese historian, considered seizing Hong Kong by force in 1967, Beijing preferred a peaceful handover and began formal talks with the United Kingdom in 1982.58 The British tried to keep Hong Kong beyond 1997, when Britain’s lease for land constituting the vast majority of the colony would expire. Deng rebuffed them and secured a 1984 agreement that set the terms of the territory’s return to Chinese control. Under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, China would regain sovereignty over Hong Kong in July 1997 and designate it a “special administrative region.” Local authorities would enjoy a “high degree of autonomy,” and the existing capitalist system and way of life would stay unchanged for fifty years—the cornerstone of Beijing’s “one country, two systems” formula.59

Deng assured Margaret Thatcher, then British prime minister, that “horses will still run, stocks will still sizzle, dancers will still dance” in Hong Kong after its handover. For the most part, this promise was kept. The city maintained its reputation as one of the world’s freest economies, and foreign investors continued funneling money through its capital markets in search of opportunities in China. The Basic Law, Hong Kong’s post-handover constitution, provided for freedoms of speech, assembly, and protest that weren’t available on the mainland. Activists organized demonstrations criticizing the Communist Party. Falun Gong, the spiritual movement banned by the party in 1999, operated freely. Newspapers, magazines, and books published in Hong Kong carried gossip about political intrigue in Beijing and mocked Chinese leaders. Hong Kongers could access an unfettered internet, while people in mainland China ran up against their government’s Great Firewall.

Beijing valued Hong Kong as a gateway to Western finance, but worried that foreign powers were using it as a base for subverting Communist rule. Party leaders recalled how, during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Hong Kongers staged rallies, raised money, and bought supplies for the demonstrators in Beijing before the party crushed what it denounced as “counter-revolutionary riots.” During one of British diplomat Percy Cradock’s many visits to Beijing in the early 1990s for talks on Hong Kong, the then general secretary, Jiang Zemin, pulled him to a window at the Great Hall of the People and pointed at Tiananmen Square, saying “there were the tents and they were put up with Hong Kong money,” Cradock recalled. “And I couldn’t deny it. It was a fact.”60

For Xi Jinping, Hong Kong is also personal. His father, Xi Zhongxun, a top party official in Guangdong from 1978 to 1980, dealt with Hong Kong as he confronted an exodus of mainlanders fleeing to the British colony as economic refugees. To stem the outflows, he cultivated ties with Hong Kong officials and businessmen and tried to narrow the economic gap. He helped set up a “special economic zone” in Shenzhen and encouraged investment from Hong Kong. The elder Xi remained involved in Hong Kong affairs after leaving Guangdong, meeting delegations from the city and facilitating Sino-British talks on the territory’s future. Xi Jinping himself visited Hong Kong several times as a local and regional official to drum up investment from the city, which he praised as a globally competitive commercial center worthy of emulation by mainland counterparts.

By the early 2000s, Beijing was starting to see Hong Kong more as a wellspring of trouble. In 2003, when Hong Kong’s economy cratered due to a deadly outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) that started in southern China, the central government took steps to aid the city’s recovery, for instance allowing many more mainlanders to visit. Later that year, protests flared in Hong Kong against proposed legislation that would outlaw actions deemed subversive to Beijing, forcing the city’s government to withdraw the bill. At the time, the party did little to suppress such defiance, focusing instead on the economic well-being of a key financial hub—and a safe haven where many wealthy Chinese and members of the revolutionary elite, including Xi’s relatives, kept their assets.

Xi took on responsibilities over Hong Kong affairs after joining the party’s top leadership in 2007, becoming head of the party’s coordination group for Hong Kong and Macau policy. In an early sign of his more interventionist approach, Xi appeared to admonish Hong Kong’s top official and urged the city’s executive, legislative, and judicial branches to cooperate with one another. He oversaw an effort to instill patriotic pride among Hong Kongers, including plans—announced in 2010—to introduce “Moral and National Education” classes into the city’s schools, but officials shelved the proposals amid backlash against what many locals denounced as brainwashing.61 Sentiment toward mainland China also shifted, with opinion polls showing that more residents were identifying as Hong Kongers rather than Chinese.

Xi sensed the rise of a separatist movement, even though only a tiny minority of Hong Kongers advocated independence at the time and in the years since. In July 2012, Xi “issued the party center’s first combat order to purge Hong Kong independence elements,” and followed up with more demands to stem secessionist sentiment, recalled Chen Zuo’er, a former deputy director of the Chinese government’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office.62 After Xi took power, his administration issued a June 2014 white paper emphasizing that Beijing exercised “comprehensive jurisdiction” over Hong Kong. The document declared that the city’s partial autonomy stemmed “solely from the authorization by the central leadership”—implying that the central government could strip Hong Kong of its self-administration powers at any time.63

Just two months later, when Beijing announced a plan that would allow Hong Kongers to pick their next top official from candidates screened by the central leadership, hundreds of thousands of protesters rebuffed the proposal by occupying streets outside the city’s government headquarters. This extraordinary show of defiance, which became known as the “Umbrella Movement,” stunned Beijing.64 Xi now saw himself as being locked in a “long-term, complex and at times sharp” struggle for control over Hong Kong, recalled Chen, the former official. “The trees want tranquility but the winds won’t stop,” he quoted Xi as saying.65

Beijing responded by tightening its vise on Hong Kong. China’s deputy ambassador in London told a U.K. lawmaker that the Sino-British Joint Declaration had become void, irking British officials who believed that the treaty was still binding.66 Hong Kong authorities jailed a number of protest leaders and disqualified six opposition members of the local legislature. Mainland security agents reportedly entered Hong Kong to abduct a bookseller in late 2015 and Chinese-Canadian financier Xiao Jianhua in early 2017—sparking outcry over the affront to the city’s separate British-style legal system. Beijing accelerated plans to integrate Hong Kong economically with major cities in Guangdong and the former Portuguese colony of Macau to form a new megapolis known as the “Greater Bay Area.”67 When Xi visited Hong Kong in 2017 to mark the twentieth anniversary of the city’s handover, he brought a warning: any attempt to challenge or subvert the central government would be “an act that crosses the red line, and is absolutely impermissible.”68

That red line was emphatically breached in the summer of 2019, when mass demonstrations erupted in Hong Kong against the local government’s efforts to pass legislation that would allow the extradition of criminal suspects to the mainland.69 Peaceful marches against what many saw as an erosion of Hong Kong’s separate legal system morphed into violent protests that rocked the Asian financial center for months. Black-clad militants armed with bricks, Molotov cocktails, and improvised weapons vandalized symbols of Beijing’s authority and battled riot police, wounding officers and pro-Beijing residents (in at least one case fatally).70 The police applied hard-nosed tactics—firing large volumes of tear gas and rubber bullets, and even the occasional live rounds—that caused injuries to protesters and journalists, and spurred widespread allegations of police brutality.71

The 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests stung Xi. Besides the embarrassment caused to his leadership, the unrest exposed deep fissures that belied his China Dream and supplied Western governments with fodder for pressuring Beijing. Chinese officials blamed the turmoil on foreign meddling and economic frustration, though privately some admitted they had failed to appreciate the depth of public resentment.72 Their solution was a thorough remaking of Hong Kong, to crush dissent, reduce social inequities, and, most crucially, inculcate a stronger sense of Chinese national identity among younger generations.

The party’s Central Committee approved this strategy in late 2019, promising broad changes to Hong Kong’s political, economic, education, and policing systems.73 The following summer, Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law on the city that outlawed anti–Communist Party activism and allowed authorities to suppress political dissent with mainland-style policing. In 2021, Chinese lawmakers passed electoral changes to allow only “patriots” to govern Hong Kong, helping pro-Beijing politicians to secure all but one seat in the city’s legislature at elections that year—albeit with a record low voter turnout of about 30 percent. Several local news organizations known for critical coverage of the Communist Party and Hong Kong politics closed down after police detained senior media executives and editors for alleged national security offenses.74 In 2022, Hong Kong named a former law-enforcement chief and veteran police officer, John Lee, as its chief executive—the first time a security specialist had taken the city’s top job since the 1997 handover.

National education became a priority. Authorities banned acts of disrespect to the Chinese national flag, and ordered schools to conduct flag-raising ceremonies at least once a week.75 Teachers who supported anti-government protests were reprimanded or dismissed.76 Textbooks were rewritten to remove material that could antagonize Beijing and to add more patriotic content. New material included passages promoting national security and asserting that Hong Kong wasn’t a British colony because China didn’t recognize the unequal treaties that ceded the territory to the U.K.77 Elementary-school children as young as six are now taught lessons on national security. New teaching material includes a role-play script—titled “Who stole the National Flag?”—that featured a patriotic character saying: “Yes! I love the motherland. I love to collect or buy things with the national flag on it.” Another character, named “Destroyer,” stomps on the flag and has no friends.78

Chinese officials describe the policy overhauls as Hong Kong’s “second handover,” only this time, Beijing would settle matters once and for all. “As President Xi says, one country is one country,” said Ip Kwok-him, a senior pro-Beijing politician in Hong Kong and a member of China’s national legislature. “It’s no longer about accommodating Hong Kong’s needs.”79





TREASURE ISLAND


IN THE COMMUNIST PARTY’S TELLING, Taiwan was among the sacred pieces of the motherland stolen by foreign imperialists and which must be recovered to restore China’s dignity. The Qing empire annexed the island in the 1680s but were forced to cede it, along with other territory, to Japan after losing the 1894–1895 Sino-Japanese war. Some Taiwanese elites opposed the deal and declared an independent Republic of Formosa, but Tokyo crushed the movement and started five decades of colonial rule on Taiwan that lasted until the end of World War II.

Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang government took control of Taiwan in 1945 and absorbed the island into the Republic of China. Its administrators imposed brutal authoritarian rule, aiming to root out Communist subversion and pro-Japanese sympathies within the local populace. When Mao seized power in 1949, Chiang withdrew his government to Taiwan, bringing gold reserves and cultural treasures, and spurring an exodus of perhaps a million mainlanders to the island. The influx would fuel decades of tensions between native-born Taiwanese and waishengren, as mainlanders who arrived after World War II were known, many of whom were Kuomintang members and supporters.

Successive Communist leaders have since declared their desire to seize Taiwan, which Beijing calls a “treasure island of the motherland.” Mao was preparing to assault Taiwan when the Korean War broke out in 1950, prompting the U.S. to join the fighting and send the Seventh Fleet to the Taiwan Strait to forestall an invasion. Beijing sent troops to aid North Korea instead, and over subsequent decades, the Chinese military did little about Taiwan beyond skirmishing with Kuomintang forces and bombarding Taiwanese-held islands just off mainland China. From 1954 to 1978, PLA artillery lobbed high explosives and propaganda leaflets onto the Taipei-controlled Kinmen Islands just a few miles away from Fujian province, including nearly half a million shells fired during a six-week bombardment in 1958.80 Beijing pushed hard on the diplomatic front, convincing dozens of countries to cut ties with the Kuomintang government and, most crucially, getting the United Nations to unseat Taipei in 1971 and recognize the Communist government as the “only legitimate representatives of China.”

Chiang, for his part, hoped to rule China again. While Mao’s Great Leap Forward ravaged the People’s Republic in the early 1960s, Chiang prepared plans to “retake the mainland.”81 Known as “Project National Glory,” it was to be a monumental undertaking, comprising amphibious landings, airborne assaults, and special operations behind enemy lines.82 But Chiang lost faith after Kuomintang forces suffered a deadly training accident and naval losses against the PLA in 1965. The project was scrapped seven years later.83 Any lingering hopes of restoring Kuomintang rule on the mainland dissipated with Chiang’s death in 1975. His successors focused instead on governing, developing, and defending Taiwan.

Beijing changed tack on Taiwan in the late 1970s. Deng Xiaoping extended conciliatory gestures toward the Kuomintang and normalized relations with the U.S., which cut formal ties with Taipei. Chinese officials halted the shelling of Kinmen and other Taiwanese-controlled islands and pledged to de-escalate tensions. They proposed peaceful unification under the “one country, two systems” concept, whereby Taiwan would keep its existing social and economic system and enjoy significant autonomy from Beijing.84 Taipei rejected the formula, which Beijing would apply in Hong Kong and Macau when Britain and Portugal returned those territories to China in the late 1990s.

Chiang’s son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, took steps to ease hostilities and allow some indirect contacts with the mainland before he died in 1988. Lee Teng-hui, who succeeded Chiang to become Taiwan’s first native-born president, followed his predecessor’s lead. He walked a careful line at first, insisting the mainland must democratize before unification could occur.85 Lee ended the Kuomintang government’s state of emergency against the “Communist rebellion” in 1991, thereby acknowledging Communist control over the mainland.86 The following year, Chinese and Taiwanese representatives started talks on opening economic and other ties, while setting aside conflicting claims of sovereignty over China.87 It was a murky compromise that Kuomintang officials would, years later, call the “1992 consensus”—a tacit understanding that both sides agreed that there is “one China,” without defining what that meant.88

Even so, Beijing came to loathe Lee for his international travel and remarks that implied Taiwanese nationhood. For instance, he called the Kuomintang an “exogenous regime” in Taiwan, similar to colonial powers like the Netherlands, Spain, and Japan. Lee’s 1995 visit to Cornell University, his alma mater, even sparked a military standoff between Washington and Beijing. The PLA practiced amphibious landings and fired missiles near Taiwan, prompting the U.S. to deploy warships to the vicinity. The confrontation stretched into 1996 as Beijing tried to sway Taiwan’s first presidential election with more drills and missile-firings, only to see Washington send two aircraft-carrier battle groups—a show of force that China had no answer for. “This was done precisely to send an unambiguous signal to Beijing of our resolve and overwhelming power so as to prevent any miscalculation or accident” that could lead to an armed clash with China, recalls Winston Lord, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 1993 to 1997.89

The crisis was sobering for China, exposing its weaknesses in the face of American military might. Worse still, Beijing’s aggression backfired, riling Taiwanese voters into handing a decisive win to Lee, who became the island’s first popularly elected president, with 54 percent of the vote against three challengers. The U.S. intervention in the Kosovo War as part of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization aerial bombing campaign in 1999 also worried Chinese officials, who saw the episode as a sign of Washington’s willingness to intervene in a conflict over Taiwan.

Over the next two decades, Taiwan completed a remarkable transition from an authoritarian state toward a multiparty democracy. Lee stepped down as president in 2000, abiding by the term limits he had set, ending fifty-five years of continuous Kuomintang rule in Taiwan. Power was transferred to the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party, or DPP, whose candidate eked out a win in a competitive presidential vote. Liberal-minded politicians pushed to dismantle the Kuomintang’s coercive machinery, curtail its control over the bureaucracy and news media, and strip down its business empire. Taiwan depoliticized its armed forces—once part of the Kuomintang—and retooled them into a state military. For many mainland Chinese, the island became a mirror of their own hopes and anxieties. Liberals drew inspiration, while Communist leaders saw an object lesson on the fate that might befall their one-party state.

As China’s economy took off, Beijing sought to persuade Taiwan that its economic future depended on the mainland. Taiwanese investors poured into the mainland seeking a lower-cost manufacturing base for products from electronics to machinery, while Chinese buyers purchased more Taiwanese goods, like fruit and fish. By the early 2000s, China had replaced the U.S. as Taiwan’s most important trading partner, while the island’s economy started to mellow from its heyday as a fast-growing “Asian Tiger.” Wages eventually climbed too high for some Taiwanese factories, and then stagnated, spurring an exodus of job seekers to the mainland, where more than a million Taiwanese work, according to private-sector estimates. Some of Taiwan’s biggest companies, including the iPhone assembler Foxconn, established large production plants in China staffed by mainlanders, who account for the largest share of their overall headcounts.

Along the way, the Kuomintang shed its enmity with the Communist Party, focusing instead on their shared belief that the mainland and Taiwan are part of “one China.” Kuomintang politicians advocated warmer relations with Beijing as a way to help Taiwan prosper, and the most prominent among them, Ma Ying-jeou, became president in 2008. He proceeded to expand economic links across the strait, opening the island to Chinese tourists and investors while allowing more Taiwanese capital to flow toward China. Beijing welcomed Taiwanese businesses, workers, and students to the mainland, and used such ties as leverage. When Taipei made positive overtures, Chinese trade and tourists streamed in the other direction. When the island seemed to tilt toward independence, Beijing squeezed the flow of Chinese money and threatened to use military force. And for a time, this strategy appeared to work. As Taiwan became more economically reliant on China, many Taiwanese either accepted that formal independence was impossible, or put off the idea indefinitely.

Xi Jinping extended this approach after taking power. But while his recent predecessors had seemed content to set the unification issue aside indefinitely, he signaled a degree of impatience. In 2013, Xi told a former Taiwanese vice president that political differences between Beijing and Taipei “shouldn’t be passed down from generation to generation.”90 His inflection raised eyebrows among seasoned observers, who sensed in Xi an ambition to claim Taiwan within his lifetime, though few believed he would do so by force.

By 2014, however, Beijing’s powers of persuasion were reaching their limits. President Ma’s brand had become toxic among Taiwanese who resented how China’s economic heft was enriching Taiwan’s business elite while drawing away jobs and investments. When the ruling Kuomintang tried to expedite the ratification of an unpopular trade agreement with Beijing, students occupied the legislative chambers in Taipei for three weeks and forced Ma to drop the pact.

The backlash boosted the DPP, a group that first emerged in the 1980s as an illegal opposition movement against the Kuomintang, before evolving into a broad church whose members championed a distinct Taiwanese identity and, in some cases, an officially independent Taiwan. Its leader, Tsai Ing-wen, won the 2016 presidential election in a landslide result that irked Beijing, which resented Tsai’s refusal to acknowledge the notion that Taiwan is part of “one China.” Rather, Tsai and the DPP insist that the Republic of China, Taiwan—as it is formally known—is already an independent sovereign state, complete with its own government, legislature, judiciary, and military. This means, as Tsai argues, there is no need for a formal declaration of independence.91

Xi tried pressuring Tsai with military, diplomatic, and economic tools. Beijing deployed warplanes and navy vessels near Taiwan and curtailed Chinese travel to the island. Annual tourist arrivals from mainland China, which peaked at nearly 4.2 million in 2015, fell by more than a third during Tsai’s first term as president.92 China blocked Taiwanese delegates from participating in meetings at United Nations agencies overseeing global aviation and health, and persuaded more countries to cut ties with Taiwan, leaving the island with diplomatic recognition from just over a dozen states as of this writing, down from twenty-two when Tsai took office and about seventy more than a half-century ago.

Tsai was running into problems at home too. Some Taiwanese bristled at her perceived mishandling of pension and labor reforms. Others blamed her for Taiwan’s tanking trade with the mainland and slow progress in diversifying its economy. The ruling DPP suffered humiliating losses at local elections in late 2018, while a Kuomintang populist, Han Kuo-yu, scored an upset in the mayoral race in the port city of Kaohsiung—a DPP stronghold—in part by pledging to mend trade ties with China.93 Tsai resigned as DPP chair, and disgruntled party members even questioned whether she should seek re-election in 2020.

But momentum shifted in January 2019, when Xi delivered a major speech on Taiwan that galvanized anti-Beijing views on the island. At a televised ceremony marking four decades since the Communist Party’s switch to a strategy of “peaceful unification” with Taiwan, Xi reiterated Beijing’s offer to assimilate the island under “one country, two systems,” and dangled economic carrots for Taiwanese businesses and youth. He also implicitly denounced Tsai’s government as separatists, and stressed that armed unification remained an option.94 His remarks were received poorly in Taiwan, where “one country, two systems” has never received any significant support. Tsai capitalized, pledging to defend Taiwanese democracy against authoritarian encroachment from China.

Tsai’s defiance paid off. When anti-Beijing unrest erupted in Hong Kong that summer, many in Taiwan sympathized with the protesters. Taiwanese activists ran crowdfunding campaigns to buy protective gear for Hong Kong protesters and organized rallies against local politicians seen as too friendly with Beijing. Their main target was Han Kuo-yu, who had become the Kuomintang’s presidential candidate and subsequently came under fire for visiting the mainland in early 2019 to meet senior Chinese officials handling Hong Kong and Taiwan affairs.95 “Taiwan cannot become like Hong Kong,” Wu Ma-ko, a Taiwanese pig farmer who brought his wife and son to join an anti-Han march in Kaohsiung, told me. “If we don’t speak up ourselves, the international community will come to see us as part of China and won’t speak up for us either.”96

Tsai fanned such sentiment as she chased a second presidential term, casting the January 2020 election as a choice between defending democracy and caving to Beijing for economic benefits. Voters turned out in force, re-electing Tsai with a record 8.17 million ballots and 57 percent of the vote—the highest share ever achieved by a DPP candidate.

Defeat stunned the Kuomintang and sparked a wave of infighting. Younger members called for a tougher tack against Beijing, clashing with establishment figures who held fast to the party’s founding aspirations of ruling a unified China.97 “If the Kuomintang still wants a chance to govern in Taiwan, or even avoid becoming a small fringe party, we must adjust,” the party’s youth affairs chief wrote on social media.98 The party agreed at first, electing a new chairman who pledged to rethink the Kuomintang’s China-friendly policy and put Taiwanese interests first. But he lasted less than two years, replaced by a party grandee who favored stronger ties with Beijing.99

While the Kuomintang struggled with its identity crisis, more Taiwanese were embracing a sense of nationhood. In the three decades since Lee Teng-hui launched democratic reforms, the proportion of citizens who professed a purely Taiwanese identity had grown by more than three times to surpass 60 percent, while the share of those who identified only as Chinese slipped below 3 percent from about one-quarter in 1992, according to surveys by the National Chengchi University’s Election Study Center in Taipei.100 The shift is in large part a generational one. Younger Taiwanese are more likely to emphasize their political and cultural differences with mainland Chinese—a tendency known as “naturally pro-independence.” The Covid-19 pandemic has only amplified these views. Many in Taiwan blamed the Communist Party for failing to contain the outbreak in central China, and blocking Taiwanese officials from attending the World Health Organization’s annual assembly and technical meetings.101

In Beijing, the apparent failure of economic persuasion has fueled bellicose arguments that peaceful unification is a dead end. Though Xi often stressed that the party prefers a cordial solution, some analysts argue he has set implicit deadlines for taking Taiwan—citing his declarations that China should achieve a degree of “socialist modernization” by 2035, and become a “modern socialist power” by 2050. Xie Chuntao, a senior party academic, seemed to confirm such suspicions. “The Taiwan issue would have been resolved” by the mid-twenty-first century, Xie said. “If we can’t even achieve national unification, then I think this ‘modern socialist power’ of ours actually isn’t that powerful.”102





READY TO FIGHT


ONE SWELTERING SEPTEMBER MORNING IN 2015, seven decades after Japan’s surrender ended World War II, Beijing shuddered with the rumbling of tanks and rhythmic stomps of goose-stepping soldiers. Fearsome phalanxes of ballistic missiles, drones, and other armaments streamed down the Avenue of Eternal Peace, cheered on by fifty-five thousand spectators while jets and helicopters streaked overhead. The parade was one of China’s most extravagant displays of military muscle, and the first time Beijing had hosted such pageantry to celebrate an occasion other than a milestone birthday of the People’s Republic.103

Dressed in an olive-green Mao suit denoting his status as chairman of the party’s Central Military Commission, Xi Jinping took in the spectacle from atop Tiananmen, the Gate of Heavenly Peace, alongside party grandees and esteemed foreign guests. The event ostensibly commemorated the Allied victory, but no major Western power sent incumbent leaders or troops to participate. Xi kicked off proceedings with dovish remarks that belied the hawkish vibes of the martial display. “We Chinese love peace. No matter how much stronger it may become, China will never seek hegemony or expansion,” said Xi, declaring that he would slash the People’s Liberation Army ranks by three hundred thousand personnel—the biggest reduction in two decades.

What Xi portrayed as a peaceable gesture was a key step in turning China into a first-rate military power. The PLA may have been the world’s largest armed forces, numbering 2.3 million active personnel before Xi’s cuts, but its warfighting capabilities were hamstrung by an antiquated command structure, obsolete doctrine, and a lack of combat experience. The People’s Republic hadn’t waged a full-scale war since 1979, and its leaders could only look on with nervous admiration as Western forces flexed their destructive might across the Middle East, the Balkans, and Afghanistan. If China was to be taken seriously as a global power, as Xi demanded, it needed a military that could challenge its American and European counterparts. “To achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Xi said, “we must ensure unity between a prosperous country and a strong military.”104

Xi has since pledged to modernize the PLA by 2035 and establish a “world-class fighting force” by the middle of the twenty-first century.105 Success would secure China’s rise, allowing it to challenge American dominance in Asia, prevail in territorial disputes, and protect Beijing’s expanding global interests—from raw materials and trade routes to overseas investments and expatriate communities. But the overhauls also risked antagonizing elements within the PLA by stripping away their wealth and prestige, while releasing legions of demobilized soldiers ill-prepared to compete in a bustling labor market.

Mao Zedong once declared that “political power comes from the barrel of a gun,” and the PLA has proved as much since its founding in 1927. While modern militaries in democratic systems commit to serving the government of the day, whomever they may be, the PLA exists as the armed wing of China’s Communist Party, sworn to “listen to the party’s command” and act as the ultimate guarantor of its power.

Even so, there were moments when loyalties wavered, swayed by power struggles or even a sense of moral duty. In 1976, Mao’s successor Hua Guofeng secured support from key military leaders before toppling the Gang of Four, who were arrested by the PLA unit responsible for protecting top officials. Deng Xiaoping’s orders to crush the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests proved too much for some troops—by one count, 110 officers committed serious disciplinary breaches, while 1,400 soldiers deserted.106 The commander of the 38th Group Army, Major General Xu Qinxian, refused to lead armed troops into Beijing without clear written orders and reportedly feigned illness—a show of defiance that got him court-martialed, expelled from the party, and jailed.107

Every leader since Mao has expended considerable effort to secure control over the proverbial gun. While Deng was often content to govern without formal posts, the veteran revolutionary made sure to hold the chairmanship of the party’s Central Military Commission from 1981 to 1989. He sidelined the military from politics, and in return, granted the PLA significant autonomy to manage its affairs and even build businesses—including nightclubs, pharmaceuticals, and real estate—to make up for paltry defense budgets in the 1980s.108 Encouraged to partake in China’s economic boom, the PLA grew increasingly corrupt and distracted from its core duties.

Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao both tried to modernize the PLA, with mixed success. Jiang started pushing the PLA out of business in 1998, offering budget increases to placate the brass, but many senior officers simply transferred control of these enterprises to their relatives. The military’s reluctance to share information or coordinate with civilian authorities also hampered command and control, even embarrassing the leadership at times.109 When China flight-tested a new stealth fighter in 2011 just hours before Hu met the visiting U.S. defense secretary, the Chinese leader reportedly seemed unaware of the test—fueling speculation that he was having trouble reining in PLA hawks.110 Combat readiness deteriorated as corruption grew endemic, particularly with the buying and selling of ranks, as well as perks like military registration plates that allowed drivers to flout traffic rules.111 Securing a general rank reportedly cost more than a million dollars, but the investment would more than pay for itself with bribes and kickbacks.112

Xi came to power determined to clean house. He made a stronger PLA a centerpiece of his China Dream, demanding that the armed forces be “ready to fight and win wars.” He issued new strategic guidelines calling for a military that could fight digital-age conflicts, deter rival powers, and protect Beijing’s interests in Asia and beyond.113 Chinese strategists cheered his vision, calling it a necessary step in surmounting American attempts to “encircle” China—particularly President Barack Obama’s “pivot” to Asia strategy that boosted U.S. military and economic presence in the region.

But before retooling the gun, Xi had to first ensure it was in his grasp. He purged the PLA’s senior ranks of corrupt and politically unreliable officers, reorganized its leadership structure, and concentrated command authority in his own hands. Already chairman of the Central Military Commission, Xi claimed the title of “commander in chief” and a direct role overseeing combat operations, often appearing in camouflage fatigues as he toured military facilities.114 He shrank the eleven-strong military commission to seven members and centralized decision-making under the “CMC chairman responsibility system,” whereby Xi himself would decide all major matters—unlike how his recent predecessors delegated day-to-day duties to the CMC vice chairmen, who were professional military commanders.115 In 2020, lawmakers rewrote legislation to give the Xi-chaired CMC more powers over defense policy, at the expense of the civilian government headed by the premier.

During Xi’s first term, authorities investigated more than four thousand corruption cases in the PLA and punished some thirteen thousand people, including more than one hundred high-level officers. Two former CMC vice chairmen were purged, though one died of cancer before his case reached court-martial.116 Two sitting CMC members also went down, with the PLA’s chief of joint staff receiving a life sentence and the general who oversaw political indoctrination committing suicide while under investigation.117 In their place, Xi brought in commanders whom he deemed more loyal and professional, including a new chief of joint staff who fought with distinction in the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war. Nearly 90 percent of the PLA delegation to the 2017 party congress were first-time participants, marking a thorough turnover in the military brass.

The purges facilitated an overhaul of the PLA’s command structure, removing or cowing officers who might resist change. Before Xi took charge, the PLA Ground Force—as the army is known—accounted for seven of eleven members on the Central Military Commission and some 70 percent of all PLA personnel. The four “general departments” that comprised the PLA leadership—overseeing military operations, political indoctrination, logistics, and equipment maintenance—had decayed into fiefdoms riddled with financial waste and graft.118 The PLA administered its fighting forces across seven “military regions” that functioned like mini-states, each with its own schools, hospitals, hotels, and newspapers. And while region chiefs commanded army units, air and naval forces were controlled by their own service headquarters, making it harder to conduct integrated operations.119

Xi scrapped the four general departments, and redistributed their functions across fifteen smaller departments and offices that reported directly to the Central Military Commission. Also gone were the seven military regions, replaced with five new “theater commands”—covering north, south, east, west, and center—that were each led by a regional chief vested with more direct control over all land, air, naval, and missile forces within their area. Xi also diluted some of the Ground Force’s authority, so as to boost the air, naval, and strategic missile forces that are crucial for projecting power beyond China’s periphery. A new Rocket Force was created to oversee the PLA’s ballistic-missile arsenal, while a new Strategic Support Force took charge of space, cyber, and electronic warfare. Ground forces were hit hardest by Xi’s cuts, with the army’s share of PLA personnel falling below 50 percent.120 More than 30 percent of commissioned officers were let go. Noncombat functions—such as song-and-dance troupes—were scaled down.121

In some ways, the changes mirror U.S. defense reforms introduced in the late 1980s to reduce rivalry between the armed services and facilitate joint operations. But Xi made sure to retain a Soviet-era feature of political control—the dual leadership system whereby military units are headed by two officers typically of equal grade: a commanding officer, with formal authority over combat decisions, and a political commissar, who would enforce party directives.

Drawing inspiration from the U.S., Xi urged greater “military-civil fusion,” whereby the military took advantage of civilian resources to boost its capabilities for waging war. This fusion means tapping civilian advances in science and technology, bringing in civilian contractors to improve military supply chains, and even incorporating military specifications in civilian transport so that they can be easily mobilized for combat use. Defense contractors ramped up the development and production of weapons that could deny U.S. forces access to waters near China’s coastline. Beijing built its first overseas military outpost in the African nation of Djibouti, which also hosts U.S. and Japanese bases and has served as a supply stop for Chinese warships on antipiracy patrols in the Gulf of Aden.122

Xi’s reforms won praise, especially from combat commanders frustrated by graft. There was resentment too, from generals who once controlled large budgets and now ran lower-ranked offices. Senior officers lost some perks and found it harder to supplement salaries with other, sometimes illicit, activities. Demobilized servicemen continued staging protests to vent against the government’s perceived failure to give them adequate benefits and new livelihoods.

And a key question remains: How capable is China’s new-era military? The PLA has demonstrated improved capabilities under Xi by conducting peacetime operations and combat drills with increasing range, complexity, and frequency. Its navy evacuated hundreds of Chinese nationals from conflict-torn Yemen in 2015, while the air force sent humanitarian aid and Covid-19-related medical supplies across Asia.123 But insofar as war is the one true test of a military’s worth, the PLA has offered few answers since the 1979 Sino-Vietnamese war, when the two sides ground out a bloody stalemate, before waging occasional skirmishes on land and at sea until Beijing and Hanoi normalized relations in 1991.

This relative inexperience was in part a strategic choice. Though the People’s Republic largely inherited its boundaries from the Qing dynasty, which conquered Tibet and Xinjiang, annexed Taiwan, and stretched into present-day Mongolia and Russia, the Communist Party willingly gave up large swaths of Qing territory that had fallen into foreign hands. Pursuing these claims would have meant bitter quarrels or even war with China’s neighbors, including the Soviet Union. Beijing has thus settled some seventeen of the twenty-three territorial disputes it has been involved in since 1949, often by offering hefty concessions that left it with only modest shares of the land it once claimed.124

Most of the outstanding disputes, however, are far more intertwined with China’s prestige. In the South China Sea, five Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan assert territorial and maritime claims that overlap with Beijing’s broad claims of sovereignty over the strategic waters. Beijing continues to contest Tokyo’s control over a group of islands in the East China Sea—known as Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese—that Japan first claimed in the 1890s and has administered since 1972. The Sino-Indian boundary, meanwhile, has yet to be delimited since the two sides fought a border war in 1962.

These frontiers have become proving grounds for Xi’s new-look PLA. Chinese aircraft and warships regularly intercept American counterparts asserting “freedom of navigation” in disputed parts of the South China Sea, occasionally resulting in what Washington calls unsafe encounters caused by risky Chinese maneuvers.125 Tokyo has reported higher frequencies of PLA warplane sorties that approached close enough for Japan to scramble fighters in response.126 On China’s loosely defined border with India, tensions between the two armies boiled over into physical clashes and even a lethal brawl in June 2020, when at least twenty Indians and four Chinese died in a high-altitude melee fought with rocks, batons, and nail-studded clubs—the first time in three decades that China engaged in a known deadly border skirmish.127

The one theater that the PLA has focused on the most is Taiwan, the final piece in China’s unification jigsaw. For Chinese war planners, Taiwan serves as a strategic gateway to the Pacific Ocean, thanks to its central location in the “first island chain,” off China’s east coast, that stretches from Japan to the Philippines—a concept defined as part of a U.S. Cold War strategy to contain the Soviet Union and China by placing American forces in the Western Pacific.128 General Douglas MacArthur once described Taiwan as an “unsinkable aircraft carrier” that can project power and dominate vital shipping lanes, and Chinese strategists agree.129 “As long as the Taiwan Strait issue is resolved, the first island chain that blocks and threatens our country will be broken, and our access to the western flanks and the deep-blue Pacific Ocean shall be unimpeded,” one retired Chinese general wrote.130

Chinese officials and state media often boast that the modernized PLA could capture Taiwan with ease—“within three days,” one official claimed—thanks to an overwhelming superiority in troops and technology.131 But the public bravado belies a circumspection that Chinese strategists often express privately about the prospects of forceful annexation. The PLA’s purpose for the time being, some say, is to deter Taiwan from declaring formal independence, a move that China would consider casus belli.

Even by Beijing’s own assessments, capturing Taiwan is a daunting task. PLA literature acknowledges that an invasion of Taiwan would require complex battle planning.132 It would feature three main phases, from wearing down Taiwanese defenses with aerial bombing, missile strikes, and naval blockades, to amphibious landings, and then pitched battles on Taiwan itself, before Chinese forces could start transitioning from invasion to occupation.133 Every stage of the campaign would be fraught with formidable difficulties, such as rough seas in the Taiwan Strait many months of the year, the limited number of beaches suited for amphibious landings, and the logistical challenge of transporting and protecting a massive invasion force across many miles of open water.

China could test the PLA’s capabilities through limited campaigns, such as blockading Taiwan or seizing some of its outlying islands, including the Kinmen and Matsu chains just off the mainland or the tiny Pratas in the South China Sea, which are all isolated and hard to defend. After U.S. House speaker Nancy Pelosi defied Chinese warnings to visit Taipei in August 2022, the PLA encircled Taiwan with rocket and ballistic-missile fire and conducted combat drills near the island—a showcase of its capabilities in cutting off Taiwan from outside help.134 Analysts say such operations could allow Beijing to squeeze Taipei and secure some territorial gains before Washington can muster a decisive response, though they still risk escalation into a full-blown war, an unpalatable prospect for the party.135

In the meantime, Beijing has waged what military experts call “gray-zone warfare” against Taiwan—a campaign of sustained intimidation aimed at wearing down the island’s defenses and demoralizing its people.136 The strategy comprises military operations such as amphibious-assault drills, naval patrols, and warplane sorties, which are paired with non-military pressure including cyber and disinformation attacks, diplomatic pressure, and even the use of sand dredgers to harass residents on Taiwan’s outlying islands.137

PLA aircraft and warships have maintained an almost constant presence near Taiwan, forcing the island’s military to intercept them at an exhausting pace. Over the first nine months of 2020, Taiwanese warplanes scrambled nearly three thousand times against approaching Chinese aircraft, at a cost of almost $900 million.138 The following year, PLA fighters, bombers, and other planes flew more than 880 sorties near Taiwan’s southwestern coast, more than double the roughly 380 sorties flown there in 2020.139

Such pressure exerts a heavy toll on Taiwan’s air force by raising fuel and maintenance costs, wearing out pilots and planes, and eroding their combat readiness. The PLA can afford such an attritional approach. Its fleet of more than twenty-five hundred fighters, bombers, and other aircraft outnumbers Taiwan’s roughly four hundred fighters, which include decades-old airframes that are less reliable and increasingly expensive to maintain.140 The psychological toll is considerable too, as described by Lee Hsi-min, a retired admiral and Taiwan’s top military commander from 2017 to 2019: “You say it’s your garden, but it turns out that it is your neighbor who’s hanging out in the garden all the time. With that action, they are making a statement that it’s their garden—and that garden is one step away from your house.”141

Lee champions the use of asymmetric warfare to mitigate the PLA’s superior numbers and firepower, whereby Taiwan’s military would retool itself as a more mobile, resilient, and cost-effective force that can survive Chinese attacks and strike back.142 Endorsed by many Western strategists, his proposals call for Taiwan to maintain just a small number of high-end armaments to counter China’s gray-zone operations and sustain public morale. The bulk of the Taiwanese military, Lee argues, should be rearmed with large volumes of small, cheap, and lethal weapons—including mobile anti-ship and air defense systems, drones, sea mines, and anti-tank missiles—that are easier to disperse and hide, and therefore harder to destroy while they batter an incoming invasion force. Existing reserves should also be reorganized into territorial defense units capable of waging urban and guerrilla warfare. “It is a concept of denial, instead of control,” Lee says. “We can’t achieve air superiority or control the Taiwan Strait, but we can deny the enemy control over our airspace and waters.”143

While some in Taiwan’s defense establishment remain resistant to Lee’s ideas, President Tsai has committed to buying arms suited for such a strategy, alongside big-ticket deals for advanced fighter jets, tanks, and missiles.144 Taiwanese strategists advocating asymmetric warfare also found validation in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, where Moscow’s much-vaunted military—modernized to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars—suffered heavy losses against smaller Ukrainian forces employing guerrilla tactics, drones, and Western weaponry.

Even so, questions remain over whether Taiwan can field enough qualified and motivated personnel to mount an effective defense.145 Its military has a solid core of professional officers and regular troops, analysts say, but remains underfunded and lacks adequate reserve forces that would contribute the vast majority of combatants in wartime. As of 2020, Taiwan had about 169,000 active military personnel compared to roughly 2.3 million reservists, who have either received minimal refresher training once every two years or have been completely inactive for more than eight years.146 The quality of these forces has also declined as authorities reduced the length of mandatory military service for Taiwanese men, whittled down since the early 2000s from a roughly two-year requirement to just four months by the early 2010s.147 Lacking time for meaningful training, these conscripts often learn little more than basic marksmanship and perform menial duties like moving stores, leaving them ill-prepared for combat.148

Taipei has started overhauling its reserves system to provide more frequent and rigorous training. In late 2022, President Tsai announced that the length of mandatory military service would be extended to one year, starting 2024, with better pay and more robust instruction for conscripts.149 But such changes will take years to take effect, while China’s advantage continues to grow.150 By 2021, Beijing’s declared military spending already stood at more than thirteen times that of Taipei’s regular defense budget, while PLA ground troops outnumbered the Taiwanese army by more than tenfold.151 That same year, Taiwan’s defense minister warned that China would be capable of launching a full-blown attack on the island with minimal losses by 2025.152

Many Western analysts believe a U.S. intervention, or lack thereof, would decide Taiwan’s fate in the event of war. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, which governed Washington’s dealings with Taipei after formal ties were cut, requires the U.S. to ensure that the island can defend itself, and to maintain American capabilities to resist any use of force that threatens Taiwanese security.153 In practice, this arrangement has meant that successive administrations in Washington have sold arms—including tanks, missiles, and fighter jets—and provided some military training to Taiwan, while avoiding an explicit commitment to intervene by force should China invade.

Both the Trump and Biden administrations stepped up security cooperation with Taipei, sending American military personnel to train Taiwanese counterparts and advise on preparations for combat scenarios against China.154 Within U.S. defense and foreign policy circles, debates simmered over whether Washington should switch to an open pledge to defend Taiwan, with some arguing that such a commitment could deter Beijing, while others say it would be too provocative and that an American intervention would be futile.155 President Biden, for his part, kept Beijing guessing with repeated statements that the U.S. would defend Taiwan against a Chinese attack, while his subordinates insisted that Washington hasn’t changed its policy.156

Some Chinese analysts, meanwhile, argue that the U.S. and other Western powers’ refusal to intercede militarily against Russian aggression—including the 2008 war against Georgia, the 2014 annexation of Crimea, and the 2022 invasion of Ukraine—bodes well for Beijing. And while the West rapidly assembled an international coalition to sanction Russia over the Ukraine war, China is better equipped to endure such pressure, thanks to its far larger, more diversified, and globally connected economy.157

How U.S. and Chinese forces might fare in direct conflict is unclear. Some analysts say Xi’s military modernization appears to have tilted the balance in China’s favor in the Western Pacific, where the PLA can outmatch the U.S. in certain scenarios. Beijing has been developing new weapons—such as long-range “carrier-killer” missiles—that could keep American forces at bay while Chinese attackers overwhelm Taiwan. In war games simulating Chinese attempts to invade Taiwan, conducted by RAND Corporation researchers, the PLA often prevailed against U.S. and Taiwanese forces.158 Other analysts say the PLA, though well upgraded, must still prove itself through the acid test of war.

Few in Washington are waiting to find out. Since the Trump administration designated China as a “strategic competitor” in 2017, bipartisan support has coalesced behind efforts to bolster American war-fighting capabilities against the PLA. Influential voices in Japan have called for more security cooperation with the U.S. and Taiwan to deter China. While some experts believe that Beijing can afford to wait until its military and economic power becomes so overwhelming that Taipei capitulates peacefully, others warn that the Communist Party may one day find it more desirable to wage war while China still has a military edge, than to risk falling behind the U.S. without securing key prizes.159

“Ultimately, Taiwan’s fate would depend on how the U.S.-China strategic competition plays out,” says Lee Hsi-min, the retired Taiwanese admiral. A critical question is whether the Communist Party would use force to secure its vision of a unified China, a decision that—under current circumstances—would fall to one man. “Beijing prefers peaceful unification, and military means are the last resort, but we cannot really know what Xi is thinking,” Lee warns. “Never say never.”160
