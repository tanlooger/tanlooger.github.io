title: 7 Wolf Warriors Howling—The Party Remakes the World

“Diplomacy is the same as military affairs. Diplomacy is just fighting with words.”

—Zhou Enlai, Chinese premier and foreign minister


“I am very honored to be called a ‘wolf warrior’ because there are so many ‘mad hyenas’ attacking China.”

—Lu Shaye, Chinese ambassador to France


“Containment and suppression by the United States are major threats, both in the form of unplanned clashes and protracted warfare.”

—Chen Yixin, senior Chinese security official



In the summer of 2019, as Western governments cranked up criticism of China’s human-rights abuses against Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, a seasoned Chinese diplomat cried foul against what he saw as rank hypocrisy shown by those berating Beijing. As deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Pakistan, a mid-level role in one of the world’s largest diplomatic corps, Zhao Lijian didn’t quite have the standing to front his government’s response to foreign censure. But the forty-seven-year-old did boast a personal audience that his colleagues lacked—some 190,000 followers on Twitter—and a penchant for picking fights.1

Though Twitter is blocked in China, Zhao had opened an account in 2010 while stationed in Washington. At first he shared travel photos and news reports, before finding his voice skewering foreign politicians, scholars, and journalists who criticized his country. The United States became a frequent target for Zhao, who found American officials especially sanctimonious in castigating China while papering over their own problems with gun violence and racial injustice.

In July 2019, days after twenty-two mostly Western countries—the U.S. excluded—issued a joint statement at the United Nations Human Rights Council urging Beijing to stop persecuting Uyghurs in Xinjiang, Zhao fired off a string of tweets pummeling America for its failure to deal with systemic racism. White residents in Washington, Zhao wrote, would never venture into the capital’s southeastern quadrant “because it’s an area for the black & Latin.”2 The tweets angered Susan Rice, a former national security adviser to President Barack Obama. “You are a racist disgrace. And shockingly ignorant too,” she wrote in response, and called for the Chinese diplomat to be sent home.3 Zhao bit back. “You are such a disgrace, too. And shockingly ignorant, too,” he tweeted at Rice. “Truth hurts. I am simply telling the truth.”4

Twitter rows are rife in Washington, but trading insults with a Chinese diplomat was unheard of. At first, Zhao seemed to have overstepped. China’s then ambassador to the U.S. passed word to Rice indicating that he didn’t approve of Zhao’s tweets—some of which were soon deleted—and that the younger diplomat’s Twitter account didn’t reflect China’s position.5 Weeks later, when Zhao said he was returning to Beijing, critics wondered if he would be sidelined.6

But Zhao’s star was rising fast. State media praised his pugnacity in confronting China’s critics, while admirers at the foreign ministry gathered at Zhao’s office to cheer his return.7 After the BBC said Zhao exemplified an emerging “wolf warrior” psyche among Beijing’s diplomats, a reference to a popular film franchise about a Rambo-like Chinese soldier who battles Western mercenaries, Chinese nationalists embraced the epithet as praise for their hawkish envoys.8 The foreign ministry unveiled Zhao as an official spokesperson in a telling appointment. Twitter is dominated by foreigners “badmouthing China,” Zhao told an American journalist. “This is a time for Chinese diplomats to tell the true picture.”9

Using Twitter and news briefings as bully pulpits, Zhao portrayed a conniving West scheming to frustrate China’s rise as a global power. When Washington and Beijing bickered over the origins of Covid-19, Zhao promoted conspiracy theories claiming that the coronavirus originated in the U.S. and was brought to China by the American military.10 After an Australian Defence Force inquiry disclosed war crimes committed by its troops in Afghanistan, Zhao tweeted a Chinese artist’s image that depicted an Australian soldier holding a bloodstained knife against the throat of an Afghan child—prompting Australia’s prime minister to condemn Zhao and demand an apology.11

Such antics weren’t an aberration. As Xi Jinping pushes to reclaim what he sees as China’s rightful place in the world, his diplomats are pursuing his vision with bluster and bravado, winning plaudits at home without regard for the anger they stoke abroad. In the year Zhao was promoted, the Chinese ambassador to Canada accused his hosts of “white supremacy,” while Beijing’s envoy in Stockholm, whose fiery rhetoric got him summoned by the Swedish foreign ministry more than forty times in two years, told local radio that “we treat our friends with fine wine, but for our enemies we have shotguns.”12

Such bellicosity marks both change and continuity for the Chinese diplomatic corps. Founded in 1949 with a militaristic ethos, the foreign ministry shed its gladiatorial instincts for a more measured style in the post-Mao years, heeding Deng Xiaoping’s advice to “hide our light and bide our time,” or keep a low profile while accumulating China’s strengths. Xi discarded the “hide and bide” philosophy, urging his diplomats to “strive and accomplish things.” Whereas the foreign ministry once reserved its truculence for core interests, such as disputed territorial claims and the Dalai Lama’s perceived advocacy for Tibetan independence, Xi wants diplomats who “dare to struggle” and enforce Communist Party narratives more vigorously across a much wider range of issues—among them the treatment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, the value of Beijing’s loans to developing countries, and the efficacy of China’s Covid-19 vaccines.

Xi led from the front. He centralized control over foreign policy and styled himself a global statesman, traveling abroad more frequently and widely than any other Chinese leader.13 He championed bold plans to build global trade infrastructure, poured loans and aid into developing countries, and sought greater influence at international bodies like the United Nations. While President Donald Trump pushed protectionist policies and harangued allies for free-riding under an American security umbrella, Xi cast China as a sober guardian of globalization and a multilateral world order. Above all, Xi strode forth as a nationalist strongman, ready to fight the belligerent West. The Chinese people “will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or enslave us,” Xi declared. “Anyone who tries to do so shall be battered and bloodied from colliding with a great wall of steel forged by more than 1.4 billion Chinese people using flesh and blood.”14

This pugnacity manifested in various ways. Already a prolific exponent of economic statecraft, Beijing increasingly withheld trade, investment, and aid from countries it deemed hostile, while showing munificence to those that acquiesced. The party became more brazen in detaining foreigners as leverage, a practice critics condemned as “hostage diplomacy.” Its diplomats now favor bombastic browbeating over subtle persuasion, battling opponents big and small across negotiating tables, in newsprint, and on social media. Beijing wants to coerce and cajole countries into showing automatic deference toward a preeminent China, through what retired Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan calls an “almost Pavlovian process of conditioning.”15 Or as another Asian diplomat put it: “For China, ‘win-win cooperation’ means China wins twice.”

But Beijing’s tactics, built on largesse and intimidation, have yielded diminishing returns. Tensions with the U.S. over trade, technology, and geopolitical influence have galvanized bipartisan support in Washington for a tougher China policy. Other Western countries, including some once eager to curry favor with Beijing, were riled by Chinese efforts to influence their domestic politics, crush dissent in Hong Kong, and prop up Russia’s economy amid Western sanctions over the war in Ukraine. Opinion polls show a majority of citizens in many advanced economies distrust China and consider it a threat. Across Asia, a region Beijing considers its backyard, some governments have grown uneasy with what they see as Chinese bullying. These fissures have even stirred talk of a “new Cold War,” as liberal democracies promise to band together to resist China.

For Xi, the backlash validates his approach, proving that rivals fear China’s rise. Despite misgivings that their government may be acting too obnoxiously, many Chinese take pride in seeing their motherland put smaller neighbors in their place, compete with big powers, and, as Xi says, “look upon the world from an equal footing.”16 Chinese officials often emphasize that “diplomacy is an extension of internal affairs,” and therein lies the logic of their often undiplomatic ways. Beijing is stoking and satiating nationalistic fervor, while reshaping the global order in service of Communist Party rule.





FIGHTING WORDS


THE PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC WAS BARELY a month old when its premier and foreign minister, Zhou Enlai, assembled the bulk of his newly constituted diplomatic corps to celebrate the birth of Communist China’s foreign ministry. Some 170 people gathered that evening in November 1949 at the ministry’s new premises, an elegant European-style guesthouse in central Beijing that once hosted German royalty and the revered revolutionary Sun Yat-sen.17 Zhou had yet to meet many of his new charges, and the premier wanted to offer a personal welcome, and inspire them for the tasks ahead.18

These novice diplomats were a disparate bunch—local officials, university graduates, and peasant soldiers more comfortable with pulling triggers than pushing papers. Many hadn’t traveled abroad before and couldn’t speak any foreign language. But for Zhou, these were minor issues. Professional skills could be learned, but what every member of the foreign ministry must possess was the gumption to fight. “We must seize the initiative, have no fear, and be confident,” Zhou told his audience. Echoing earlier remarks where he declared that “diplomatic cadres are the People’s Liberation Army in civilian dress,” the premier reiterated his demands for a combative spirit.19 “Diplomacy is the same as military affairs,” he said. “Diplomacy is just fighting with words.”20

This martial ethos would animate Chinese foreign policy throughout the Mao era, as the Communist government battled for legitimacy in a hostile world. Only nine states had recognized the People’s Republic when Zhou spoke that November evening, with most countries still regarding Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang regime as the rightful government of China.21 As the “civilian army” of a fledgling nation-state, Zhou and his foreign ministry shouldered an existential mission: secure international backing for Mao’s revolution and keep foreign threats at bay.

The party picked military commanders to lead many of China’s new embassies abroad, with twelve of Beijing’s first seventeen ambassadors drawn from senior PLA ranks.22 The aim, as one former diplomat explained, was to have these “ambassador generals” apply their “strategies, tactical ideas and experience in military and political struggles toward the practice of diplomatic struggle,” and ensure that “the party and military’s fine traditions and style take root in the diplomatic corps.”23 The party also tapped PLA officers for key roles such as political counselors and military attachés, alongside civilian administrators and language specialists.24 They learned how to dress, dine, and dance, and attended lectures on politics, economics, and international law. Many turned to counterparts from fellow communist states like the Soviet Union and Poland for pointers on protocol and day-to-day embassy work.25

Zhou and his team soon proved their mettle. They held their own against the U.S., Britain, and France during post–Korean War talks in Geneva and won friends at the 1955 Bandung Conference, a landmark diplomatic assembly of twenty-nine Asian and African states that laid foundations for the Non-Aligned Movement. Zhou’s appeals for peaceful coexistence, mutual noninterference, and solidarity among developing nations persuaded more governments to recognize the People’s Republic.

Mao’s radical campaigns and antagonism toward the post-Stalin Soviet Union threatened to unravel Zhou’s gains. Beijing’s split with Moscow rattled other socialist states, many of which sided with the powerful Soviets or tried to stay neutral. Chinese diplomats struggled to maintain a facade of prosperity to the outside world while tens of millions of their countrymen died during the Great Famine. The Cultural Revolution ravaged the foreign ministry, whose officials were excoriated for their alleged bourgeois tendencies—from wearing Western suits to attending lavish parties. To avoid persecution, many Chinese diplomats swapped sophistication for ardor, incanting Mao’s maxims, distancing themselves from foreigners, and undermining relationships they had cultivated.

Chinese diplomats still scored significant wins, securing enough votes at the United Nations General Assembly in 1971 to pass a landmark resolution to eject the Kuomintang delegation and recognize the People’s Republic.26 U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China the following year, leading to the establishment of full diplomatic relations in 1979. A surge of countries switched from recognizing Taipei to Beijing, which shared formal ties with some 120 states by the end of the decade.27

Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening up” program boosted China’s participation in global governance. By 1989, Beijing had become a member of thirty-seven international organizations—from just one in 1971—and a signatory to more than 125 treaties, compared with just 6 in the first two decades after Mao’s victory.28 But political upheaval would again jeopardize China’s standing in 1989, after Deng crushed the Tiananmen Square protests. Foreign leaders, particularly in the West, recoiled at reports of Chinese troops killing hundreds, if not thousands, of people in the June 4 massacre. Beijing confronted a chorus of international condemnation, and the U.S. and Western European powers imposed an arms embargo on China.29 Some two dozen Chinese embassy staffers defected, reinforcing perceptions that diplomatic personnel were politically unreliable due to regular contact with foreign cultures.30

Deng urged patience in rehabilitating China’s battered image. “We must stay calm, stay calm, and stay calm; immerse ourselves in practical work and accomplish something—something for ourselves,” he said three months after the massacre.31 Officials later distilled Deng’s advice, dispensed over several years, into a set of principles that would shape Chinese foreign policy for the next two decades: “Observe soberly, hold our ground, face challenges calmly, hide our light and bide our time, remain free of ambitions, never assert leadership, make a difference.”32

A generation of Chinese diplomats imbibed Deng’s dictums. Under Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, China focused on integrating itself with the international order and embracing multilateral diplomacy. It cultivated ties with Southeast Asian neighbors and developing countries in Africa and signed major global pacts (but did not necessarily ratify and formally abide by them). Beijing joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and boosted its influence in the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. To dispel Western concerns over the “China threat,” Hu championed the notion of China’s “peaceful rise,” though he later dialed that down to “peaceful development,” to avoid perceptions of his country as a revisionist power shaking up the geopolitical status quo.

But while Jiang offered a jovial presence on the diplomatic stage, famously singing and playing music with his hosts and even dancing with the French president’s wife, Hu struck foreign leaders as bland and forgettable. President Obama, in a memoir, recalled Hu as “a nondescript man” who “appeared content to rely on pages of prepared talking points, with no apparent agenda beyond encouraging continued consultation and what he referred to as ‘win-win’ cooperation.”33 Hu’s placid diplomacy disappointed nationalists at home. One infamous vignette within Chinese foreign policy circles recounts how members of the public would mail calcium tablets to the foreign ministry to mock their perceived lack of backbone.34 Such insults stung, in part because they underscored the foreign ministry’s diminished standing within the government—economic and security agencies, the military, and even major state enterprises carried more clout.

The global financial crisis and the Beijing Olympics in 2008 brought China a timely fillip, marking its arrival on the global stage while Western economies faltered. Chinese leaders and diplomats carried themselves with more confidence, even brashness. At the 2009 climate summit in Copenhagen, Chinese premier Wen Jiabao skipped key meetings with Western leaders and sent subordinates in his place, fueling perceptions that Beijing was sabotaging the talks.35 Xi Jinping flexed this newfound aplomb as vice president. “There are some foreigners who’ve nothing better to do after eating their fill, pointing fingers at our affairs,” Xi told a gathering of Chinese diaspora during a 2009 visit to Mexico. “China, first of all, doesn’t export revolution; second, we don’t export hunger and poverty; and third, we don’t cause trouble for you. What else is there to say?”36

Such hawkishness boiled over at a 2010 gathering of Asia-Pacific foreign ministers in Hanoi, where U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton and several Southeast Asian counterparts issued thinly veiled rebukes of Beijing’s sovereignty claims in the South China Sea. China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, responded with a nearly half-hour tirade, often staring at Clinton as he warned Southeast Asian countries not to get involved with an outside power—a pointed reference to the U.S.37 At one point, Yang looked at Singapore’s foreign minister and said: “China is a big country, and other countries are small countries, and that is just a fact.”38 Yang would later become Xi’s top foreign policy adviser and, in 2017, join the Politburo, becoming the first diplomat in fifteen years to hold such high rank.

As paramount leader, Xi extended the hawkish trajectory that began under Hu, but with far more boldness and vigor. Xi unveiled the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, and launched a new multilateral lender—the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank—in hopes of eroding Western dominance over development finance. He championed a “new model of major-power relations” with the U.S. based on mutual respect and nonconfrontation, calling on Washington to consider Beijing a peer, rather than a junior partner in global affairs.39 His administration launched an island-building campaign in the South China Sea, reclaiming land around Chinese-controlled geographical features and fortifying them with military assets—a program that angered neighboring countries with competing territorial claims.40 Addressing fellow Asian leaders in 2014, Xi declared that “matters in Asia ultimately must be taken care of by Asians,” signaling that China would more robustly resist American influence in the region, and stake its claim as Asia’s preeminent power.41

Xi asserted personal control over China’s foreign affairs.42 He centralized diplomatic decision-making with Communist Party commissions that he chairs, while downgrading the foreign ministry’s role in shaping policy. He weighed in on key diplomatic appointments, favoring loyal and combative officials who could channel his demands for muscular diplomacy. He directed a personnel shakeup in the foreign service, ushering in outsiders with more diverse backgrounds and demanding more fighting spirit from his diplomats.43 By 2019, Xi had nearly doubled Beijing’s diplomatic spending to some 62 billion yuan, or roughly $9 billion, and turned the Chinese foreign ministry into the world’s largest diplomatic network, with some 276 embassies, consulates, and other missions globally—surpassing that of the U.S. State Department.44

Along the way, Xi became China’s face to the world. He averaged 14.3 visits to foreign countries a year between 2013 and 2019, eclipsing Jiang and Hu while even surpassing Obama and Trump, who respectively averaged 13.9 and 12.3 visits annually during their presidencies.45 Xi was also an enthusiastic host, receiving far more foreign leaders in Beijing than his American counterparts did in Washington—until China closed its borders during the Covid-19 pandemic.46 And unlike his predecessor, Xi carried himself well on the global stage. “Hu could walk into a room with his staffers and you wouldn’t know he was the leader, other than the fact that he’s standing in front,” recalls Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to President Obama. “Xi has swagger, the confidence of being the boss.”47

Such élan permeated China’s foreign relations. Just as Zhou Enlai had demanded decades ago, Xi wants his diplomats steeled with discipline and ready to fight. If traditional diplomacy is the art of allowing someone else to have your way, Xi’s envoys must insist on their way, or else.





WOLF WARRIORS


WHEN FRENCH NEWS OUTLETS raised questions about China’s initial response to the Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020, the Chinese ambassador in Paris rushed to beat back the criticism. A seasoned diplomat with a truculent streak, Lu Shaye scheduled a string of media interviews to counter allegations that the Communist Party had mishandled the first outbreak in central China. His embassy lashed out at Beijing’s critics on social media and published online essays excoriating European countries for failing to contain the coronavirus.

“Some mainstream media in the West have seen fit to disguise reality, to make fun of China, to rejoice in its misfortunes and to attack it,” Lu told one interviewer.48 “These misguided propaganda and malicious attacks against China amount to real brainwashing inflicted upon Western public opinion.” Weeks later, the Chinese embassy sparked outrage in France by publishing an online essay—attributed to an anonymous Chinese diplomat—that seemed to suggest that French nursing home caregivers were abandoning residents to die from Covid-19. The anonymous diplomat also insinuated that French lawmakers were endorsing racism by voicing support for Taiwan’s government, which the essay falsely accused of using a racist slur against the World Health Organization’s director general.49

France’s foreign ministry summoned Lu for a dressing down, prompting the Chinese embassy to remove the essay and clarify that it was neither referring to French caregivers nor accusing French lawmakers of using racist slurs.50 But far from backing down, Lu and his charges soon unleashed new invectives. “Every time the Americans make an allegation, the French media always report them a day or two later,” Lu told a French newspaper days later. “They howl with the wolves, to make a big fuss about lies and rumors about China.”51

Lu’s strident style sealed his reputation as one of Beijing’s most prominent “wolf warrior” diplomats. The sobriquet was inspired by a 2017 Chinese action movie Wolf Warrior 2, which enthralled domestic audiences with its jingoistic portrayal of a Chinese soldier-turned-security-contractor rescuing compatriots in Africa from local rebels and American-led mercenaries. It raked in more than $850 million to become China’s highest-ever grossing movie at the time, and its tagline—“Those who attack China shall be punished however far they are”—became a popular slogan among nationalistic citizens.52 Lu embraced the “wolf warrior” epithet. “We never provoked anyone. What we do is defend ourselves,” he said. “I am very honored to be called a ‘wolf warrior’ because there are so many ‘mad hyenas’ attacking China.”53

Wolf warrior diplomacy was years in the making. When Xi named Wang Yi as foreign minister in early 2013, some old acquaintances welcomed the appointment of an urbane diplomat known for his “subtlety and flexibility.”54 That sophistication soon turned into steeliness as Wang took on a tougher persona to match Xi’s. When the Australian foreign minister visited Beijing later that year, Wang skipped the usual pleasantries at the start of formal meetings and—with media still in the room—lambasted Canberra for objecting to China’s declaration of an “air defense identification zone” in the East China Sea.55 It was a stunning breach of etiquette, which a senior Australian diplomat later described as the rudest conduct he had seen in his three-decade career.56 Wang flashed his hawkish side again during a 2016 visit to Ottawa, where he tore into a local reporter for asking the Canadian foreign minister about China’s human rights record. “Your question is full of prejudice against China and an arrogance that comes from I know not where. I find this totally unacceptable,” he said. “Do you understand China? Have you been to China?”57

Whether such displays are political theater or driven by genuine indignation against the West, Chinese diplomats started taking cues from their boss. They prioritized point scoring over discreet lobbying, which often meant hewing closely to prepared talking points and delivering them with bombast. Many grew reluctant to adapt their messaging or show flexibility, fearing reprimand for doing something impolitic. Foreign diplomats found it harder to get meetings with Chinese counterparts, and when they did, their conversations became increasingly stilted. When a friend of mine arranged dinner with a former Peking University classmate who had joined China’s foreign ministry, the former classmate insisted on reporting the meeting to superiors and bringing a colleague, citing guidelines discouraging one-to-one meetings with foreigners.58

Even while President Trump antagonized allies and savaged global markets with his “America first” protectionism, Chinese diplomats contrived to squander opportunities for earning goodwill. Beijing’s envoy to a 2018 summit of Pacific Island nations stormed out of a session reserved for national leaders after his request to speak was declined.59 Later that year, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, an annual gathering of leaders from Pacific Rim economies including the U.S., Chinese negotiators stalled talks over the final communiqué to oppose certain references to “unfair trade practices”—language that they believed was singling Beijing out. Chinese delegates sought facetime with the foreign minister of the host nation, Papua New Guinea, hoping to influence the final wording. The minister declined to meet, only to see the Chinese diplomats barge into his office before security came and got them to leave.60 When officials announced that talks had collapsed, the first time an APEC summit had failed to produce a joint statement since national leaders started attending in 1993, Chinese negotiators reportedly applauded the news.61

Such belligerence grew more prevalent after Qi Yu, a career specialist in cadre training, took over as the foreign ministry’s party secretary in January 2019—an unusual appointment to a post traditionally held by a vice foreign minister. A former deputy chief of the party’s Central Organization Department, Qi was ranked second in the foreign ministry hierarchy, behind only the foreign minister, even though he lacked prior experience in foreign affairs and received no formal diplomatic title. His job was purely inward-facing, instilling discipline and fervor within the foreign service.

In internal speeches and writings, Qi called for compliance with Xi’s demands for a more pugnacious posture in foreign affairs. Chinese diplomats must “firmly counterattack against words and deeds in the international arena that assault the leadership of China’s Communist Party and our country’s socialist system,” Qi wrote, urging the foreign ministry to honor its tradition of being “the People’s Liberation Army in civilian dress”—as Zhou Enlai envisioned in the late 1940s. “The demand is for Chinese diplomats to demonstrate greater fighting ability and become more visible,” says Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Shanghai’s Fudan University. “But there are many ways to achieve this—some practice tai chi, others throw Shaolin-style punches.”62

Verbal jabs were more apparent during preparations for an April 2019 summit centered on Xi’s Belt and Road initiative. One mid-level Chinese diplomat said governments that chose to skip the summit wouldn’t be missed because there was “a long queue of countries” that wanted to attend.63 During drafting meetings for the summit communiqué, a senior Chinese negotiator accused foreign counterparts of disrespecting China when they requested revisions to Beijing’s proposed text. “Remind me to disinvite your president,” the negotiator said to one foreign delegation.64

Sometimes the aggression appears mechanistic, performed simply to check bureaucratic boxes. When a senior Chinese foreign ministry official met some European Union diplomats for lunch, ostensibly to discuss China-Europe relations, he spent most of the time criticizing the U.S. with talking points he recited off a hefty dossier. “It was bizarre. We were wondering: Why are you telling us all this? We’re not the Americans,” one attendee told me later.65 Some Chinese diplomats, aware that their browbeating behavior is counterproductive, try to assure foreign colleagues that their bluster is all business and nothing personal. One official, while lecturing a European envoy, threw in a dash of humor: “I may be a panda, but I am a kung fu panda.”66

Qi’s calls for combativeness manifested most visibly on social media. After Zhao Lijian’s appointment as foreign ministry spokesman in August 2019, Chinese diplomats and embassies rushed to open their own Twitter accounts, including Zhao’s boss, Hua Chunying, the ministry’s top spokesperson. By the spring of 2020, the number of Chinese diplomatic accounts had risen to at least 137, from 38 a year ago, with the most active among them posting hundreds of tweets a month.67

Many of them leapt straight into battle, beating back criticism of Beijing’s Covid-19 response as the contagion widened into a global pandemic in early 2020. Chinese diplomats urged other countries not to evacuate their citizens or cut travel links with China, decrying such measures as hostile and unnecessary. The foreign ministry pitched the crisis as a test of friendship and admonished ambassadors whose governments ignored Beijing’s pleas. A Chinese vice foreign minister told the Italian envoy that Rome’s decision to suspend direct flights between the two countries was an overreaction that ought to be rescinded immediately.68 “True friendship emerges in times of adversity,” said Hua, the ministry spokeswoman.69

Critics accused Beijing of hypocrisy, pointing to its treatment of Mexican citizens during an H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009, when China forced Mexicans within its borders into quarantine, suspended flights to Mexico, and stopped issuing visas to Mexicans.70 “China never admitted this was wrong, or apologized,” said Jorge Guajardo, Mexico’s ambassador to China from 2007 to 2013.71 Then in March 2020, after Xi declared initial success in containing the domestic spread of Covid-19, China blocked entry for nearly all foreigners and limited international air routes to weekly flights—the kind of border controls that Chinese diplomats told other governments not to impose on China.72

Chinese diplomats reserved their worst vitriol for those who accused Beijing of spreading Covid-19 globally. The Chinese embassy in Venezuela lashed out at local officials who referred to the “China coronavirus” by saying they were suffering from a political virus. “Since they are already very sick from this, hurry to ask for proper treatment. The first step might be to wear a mask and shut up,” the embassy said.73 China’s embassy in Sri Lanka, meanwhile, took on a local activist who described the Chinese government as “low class” in a tweet criticizing state censorship. “Total death in #China #pandemic is 3344 till today, much smaller than your western ‘high class’ governments,” the embassy tweeted at the activist, who had fewer than thirty followers at the time.74

By the time Lu Shaye, the envoy to France, joined the Covid-19 furor, he had already forged a promising career championing a more muscular foreign policy. In a 2013 essay, written while he was the foreign ministry’s director general for African affairs, Lu argued that China should be “seizing the right to international discourse” to protect its interests and fulfill its role as a responsible power.75 Promoted in 2015 to policy research director for the Communist Party’s top foreign affairs committee, Lu urged Chinese diplomats to do battle with the West and convince more countries to “accept China, as a major Eastern power, standing at the top of the world.”76

Lu applied his own advice in Ottawa, where he moved in 2017 to become Beijing’s envoy to Canada. He sparred with local media, accusing them of portraying China negatively and frustrating efforts to negotiate a bilateral trade deal. Some Canadian media, Lu said, was “not willing to put China on an equal footing, deeming itself superior to China.”77 When Canada detained a well-connected Chinese telecommunications executive in December 2018, an arrest made at Washington’s request, Lu became the face of China’s ire. He wrote a fiery newspaper op-ed accusing his hosts of “Western egotism and white supremacy” and defended Beijing’s detention of two Canadian citizens—both nabbed soon after the Chinese executive’s arrest—as “China’s self-defense.”78

Beijing promoted Lu in summer 2019, appointing him ambassador to France—a senior role handling ties with a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council that customarily came with a vice ministerial rank. A fluent French speaker, Lu pressed hard for attention in Paris, where he and the Chinese embassy racked up more than sixty media engagements in his first year in the job, including interviews, briefings, and op-eds—more than three times as many as his predecessor had logged over a five-year stint.79 “I hope I don’t have to fight against France. The best thing is that we work together,” Lu said at his first media briefing in Paris. “But if anything that harms our fundamental interests happens, then I would have to fight.”

And fight he did. He and his subordinates attacked China’s critics with metronomic pace, dismissing allegations of rights abuses in Xinjiang as “total bullshit” and arguing on Twitter over China’s alleged culpability for Covid-19.80 In one exchange with Paris-based researcher Antoine Bondaz, who tweeted sarcastic remarks about pro-Beijing trolls, the Chinese embassy called him “petite frappe,” or “little rascal,” earning Lu another dressing down from the French foreign ministry.81

Lu defended wolf warrior diplomacy as a legitimate response to foreign slander. “Westerners accuse us of deviating from diplomatic etiquette, but the criteria for assessing our own work aren’t how foreigners view us,” Lu said. “Whether our people are satisfied or not, whether they agree or not, these are the criteria we use for assessing our work.”82 And by most accounts, Chinese audiences delight in seeing their diplomats unleash lupine instincts. Fan clubs for Hua Chunying and Zhao Lijian sprouted on Chinese social media, where highlight reels showing their acerbic takedowns of Western powers often go viral.

Such displays, however, come with reputational cost. According to polls by the Pew Research Center, unfavorable views of China reached record levels in 2020 across a majority of the fourteen advanced economies surveyed—including the U.S., Britain, and Germany—as Covid-19 swept the world.83 Negative sentiment toward China would remain elevated in these countries over subsequent years, and in some cases rise to new highs.84 Scores of legislators, mostly from developed nations, banded together in 2020 to form a coalition, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, to organize international pressure against Beijing.85 A think tank affiliated with China’s Ministry of State Security, the top civilian intelligence agency, issued an internal report—presented to Xi and other leaders in April 2020—that concluded that global anti-China sentiment had reached the highest levels since the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.86

Some among China’s diplomatic old guard voiced reservations about their successors’ lupine tendencies. Fu Ying, a vice foreign minister from 2009 to 2013, wrote a People’s Daily op-ed stressing that China must pay attention to how its messages are received by international audiences. “A country’s power in international discourse relates not just to its right to speak up on the global stage, but more to the effectiveness and influence of its discourse,” Fu wrote in April 2020. “Only by winning recognition from audiences and learning from feedback can the influence of our discourse be gradually strengthened.”87 Yuan Nansheng, a former ambassador who became a foreign policy think tanker, offered a starker warning, telling an interviewer: “History proves that when foreign policy gets hijacked by public opinion, it inevitably brings disastrous results.”88

Opinions were split within the foreign ministry. Some tried to temper the aggression, but feared inviting a nationalistic backlash.89 “This is a tough job,” said one official, citing instructions to avoid behavior that can be perceived as “worshiping America” or “kneeling down before America.”90 Some ministry heavyweights openly rejected any notion of retreat. “The reason why there are ‘wolf warriors’ is because there are ‘wolves’ in this world,” Liu Xiaoming, China’s ambassador to Britain from 2010 to 2021, told state television. “Therefore, we encourage diplomats at all levels to take the initiative to fight.”91 And quite literally too, on rare occasions, most notably in October 2022 when Chinese consulate personnel in the English city of Manchester scuffled with anti–Communist Party protesters, and appeared to drag one demonstrator inside the consulate gates, throw him onto the ground, and punch him—before police broke up the melee.92

Xi himself has issued conflicting signals. At a Politburo meeting in May 2021, he called on the party to cultivate a “credible, lovable and respectable” image for China and grow its “circle of friends in international public opinion.”93 But he said officials must keep refining their abilities to wage a “public-opinion struggle”—a demand that senior diplomats distilled as a call to “never step back nor give an inch on matters of principle.”94

Some prominent nationalist commentators found it hard to tamp down the rah-rah rhetoric. Weeks before Xi’s Politburo speech, Chinese social media users hurled abuse at Hu Xijin, then the editor in chief of the nationalistic party tabloid Global Times, after he criticized a state-run microblog that had mocked India’s Covid-19 crisis. A Weibo account affiliated with the Communist Party’s law-enforcement commission published a post—since taken down—that juxtaposed images of a Chinese space rocket launch and an Indian funeral pyre, along with the caption: “China lighting a fire versus India lighting a fire.” Hu urged Chinese netizens to “place Chinese society on a moral high ground,” only to be inundated with comments calling him a traitor.95

Those who found balance between Xi’s demands for combativeness and cordiality reaped reward.96 Qin Gang, a career diplomat who won Xi’s trust while accompanying him on diplomatic engagements as the foreign ministry’s protocol chief, enjoyed an especially rapid ascent. Appointed vice foreign minister in 2018, Qin forged a reputation among Western diplomats in Beijing as a more nuanced wolf warrior who could project public charm while browbeating foreigners in private, and often asserted hard-line stances that accorded with Xi’s priorities. His fighting spirit paid off three years later, when Xi handpicked Qin as envoy to Washington, even though he hadn’t previously served as ambassador or handled any portfolios directly related to U.S. affairs. People familiar with the decision said Xi favored Qin over the foreign ministry’s preferred candidate, a U.S. specialist whom the Chinese leader saw as too meek to deal with an increasingly hostile American elite.97

In Washington, Qin alternated between cordial outreach and steely rhetoric, glad-handing business leaders and regional officials while barking back against perceived U.S. provocations. When he decided to throw punches, he didn’t hold back. During one Zoom call hosted by a U.S. nonprofit that promotes exchanges with China, Qin responded bluntly when asked how bilateral ties can be improved: “If we cannot resolve our differences, please shut up.”98

Qin struggled to secure meaningful engagements with senior policy makers and power brokers in Washington, some of whom were put off by his hawkish image.99 But his bosses didn’t see that as a failure. In the fall of 2022, the Communist Party elevated Qin into its Central Committee, making him the first sitting ambassador to be directly promoted to full membership of the elite body since the Mao era. Xi approved Qin’s appointment as foreign minister two months later.100





EAST RISES, WEST DECLINES


DAYS AFTER A PRO-TRUMP MOB stormed the United States Capitol in January 2021, a stunning outburst that symbolized the dysfunctions in American democracy, China’s Communist Party elite assembled in Beijing to hear Xi Jinping chart their priorities for the coming year.101 The general secretary exuded cautious confidence, painting a sanguine picture of his country’s prospects while acknowledging that significant challenges lay ahead. “Today’s world is going through profound changes unseen in a century,” Xi said. “But the times and trends are on our side.”

State media published only the gist of Xi’s remarks while indulging in schadenfreude over the turmoil in Washington, saying the U.S. had become a “failed state” in the eyes of its allies.102 A more nuanced appraisal emerged as officials spread Xi’s word. “ ‘The East is rising, and the West is declining’ is a trend, and developments in the international situation are favorable to us,” said Chen Yixin, a senior security official and Xi ally, relaying his leader’s appraisal of the geopolitical landscape. Even so, “containment and suppression by the United States are major threats, both in the form of unplanned clashes and protracted warfare,” Chen said.103 One county official cited a starker assessment. “The biggest source of chaos in the world today is the United States,” the official quoted Xi as saying. “The United States is the biggest threat to our country’s development and security.”104

Xi’s prognosis underscores the dramatic shifts that have unfolded under his watch in the world’s most important bilateral relationship, veering from uneasy competition to open hostility. The growing strategic distrust between the U.S. and China has led officials and scholars on both sides to raise the specter of a “new Cold War,” or even an armed conflict between two nuclear powers. Harvard political scientist Graham Allison’s warnings about a “Thucydides’s trap,” a theory that rivalries between an emerging power and an incumbent hegemon often lead to war, gained so much currency that former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd wrote a book on how to prevent “the avoidable war.”105

Sino-U.S. relations had traced a broadly benign trajectory for decades, with Richard Nixon’s China visit in 1972 heralding an era of “engagement” that led to normalized relations and forged political, business, and cultural links that still bind the two nations today.106 American advocates of engagement believed that the U.S., by expanding bilateral contacts, could help China evolve into a more-open society that hewed closer toward Western norms.107 Chinese reformers, for their part, wanted to tap foreign expertise to boost economic development.108 They adapted Western practices for the Chinese context but remained suspicious of U.S. efforts to encourage “peaceful evolution” in China through ideological subversion—a concern that Xi himself, as a local official, had articulated in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.109

Engagement endured severe setbacks, particularly U.S. sanctions against Beijing over the June 4 massacre, the 1999 U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and the 2001 collision between a Chinese fighter jet and an American surveillance plane. President Bill Clinton promoted economic ties with Beijing but eased his demands for Chinese progress on human rights, facilitating China’s accession to the WTO in 2001. The two economies became so intertwined by the mid-2000s that scholars coined the term “Chimerica” to describe their symbiosis.110 Boosted by the outsourcing of American manufacturing, and widening access to U.S. markets, China grew its economy into the world’s second largest by 2010, trailing only the U.S.

The global financial crisis dispelled any begrudging deference that Beijing might have shown Washington. After years of advice and admonishment from U.S. officials and executives on the merits of American-style capitalism, Chinese leaders could justifiably argue that their system was just as good, if not better. Former U.S. treasury secretary Hank Paulson recalled a 2008 meeting with China’s then vice premier Wang Qishan, who conveyed how a stumbling America had lost its luster in the eyes of the Beijing elite. “You were my teacher, but now here I am in my teacher’s domain,” Wang told Paulson. “And look at your system, Hank. We aren’t sure we should be learning from you anymore.”111

President Obama saw China as a potential partner in tackling global challenges, rather than a predestined adversary. He sought cooperation in areas of mutual interest—restoring global growth, preventing nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea, and combating climate change—while sidestepping confrontation over subjects like human rights.112 “We internalized the view that it is better not to confront China on values-based issues, because that will make them dig in,” recalls Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national security adviser to Obama. “I think that was a mistake.”113

Beijing’s perceived intransigence, particularly at the 2009 Copenhagen climate summit and with Yang Jiechi’s outburst at the 2010 ASEAN Regional Forum, pushed Washington toward a firmer approach. In 2011, the Obama administration announced a “pivot to Asia,” whereby the U.S. would deploy a majority of its military assets to the Pacific, strengthen ties with regional powers like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India, and negotiate a major trade pact—the Trans-Pacific Partnership—that would pointedly exclude China.114 Despite Obama’s assurances to the contrary, Chinese hawks cited his “pivot” as proof of American intentions to contain China.

Washington saw Xi’s ascent as an opportunity for a fresh start. When then vice president Joe Biden went to China in 2011 to size up Xi, he found a seemingly open-minded man who peppered his visitors with questions about U.S. politics while speaking candidly on China’s domestic challenges.115 Though Xi came across as far more confident and forthright than Hu Jintao, American officials assessed that he likely shared Hu’s commitment to stable ties with the U.S. and deeper integration into the prevailing international order.116 Daniel Russel, a senior Obama administration official, recalls suggesting to the Chinese envoy that Xi could make a positive impression during his 2012 visit to the U.S. by giving a talk to American officials and addressing sensitive issues like human rights. And Xi did just that.117 At this point, “he still appeared to be receptive, flexible and open,” Russel says.118

People who’ve interacted with Xi say he doesn’t seem to bear any deep-seated animosity toward the U.S., and, in fact, he has shown some affinity for American culture. Xi first visited the U.S. in 1985, when he, then a county chief, led an agricultural study delegation to rural Iowa and home-stayed with a local family—whom he would visit again in 2012.119 As a municipal and provincial leader, Xi made it a point to interact with American diplomats, with whom he shared his fondness for Saving Private Ryan and other Hollywood blockbusters about World War II.120 In 2010, while he was vice president, Xi sent his daughter and only child to study at Harvard University.121

Nonetheless, Xi doesn’t speak or read English, “which means that his understanding of America has always been intermediated through official Chinese sources of translation, which are not always known for accuracy, subtlety, or nuance,” writes Kevin Rudd, who has met Xi on numerous occasions since the 1980s, when Rudd was an Australian diplomat in China. Xi’s views on the United States are likely shaped by latent biases within the Chinese foreign policy and intelligence bureaucracies, as well as the tendency of officials to second-guess what Xi wants to hear, says Rudd, who notes that American leaders face similar problems in trying to understand China.122

Xi toughened his demeanor as he took power and grew into the job. By the time Obama hosted Xi for a state visit in 2015, the Chinese leader appeared “much more decisive and much more confident,” showing firmness when laying down Beijing’s markers on strategic issues like North Korea, Russel recalls.123 When Obama pressed Xi on China’s cyber theft of American technology and efforts to militarize artificial islands in the South China Sea, the Chinese leader seemingly acquiesced by publicly pledging to stop such activities, only for American officials to discover later that the industrial espionage and militarization were continuing unabated.124

Trade imbalances, ultimately, tipped the scales in Washington on China. In 2016, Donald Trump won the presidency in part by tapping blue-collar resentment over job losses blamed on cheap Chinese imports, a sentiment he fueled on the campaign trail with claims that China committed “rape” against the U.S. with unfair trade practices. The result stunned Chinese officials, who scrambled to acquaint themselves with Trump’s mercurial ways.125 Despite a honeymoon period in 2017, during which Trump and Xi hosted each other with lavish receptions at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and in Beijing respectively, the U.S. launched a trade war the following year, imposing tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Chinese imports.126

As Trump and his advisers saw it, China had misled the U.S. about its long-term goals and reneged on its pledges—as part of its WTO accession—to transition toward a market economy. They believed Xi had not only failed to open China’s markets fully, but doubled down on its model of state-led development by protecting key industries, subsidizing exports, stealing foreign technology, and manipulating its currency. White House hawks called for export controls and other curbs that would cut Chinese access to U.S. technology and “decouple” the world’s two largest economies.127 Similar sentiment swept Western capitals that previously flattered Xi with red-carpet treatment. The Chinese leader once could address Australia’s parliament, share a ride with Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in her horse-drawn carriage, and receive a grand welcome at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, but such niceties dried up as those governments started criticizing Beijing for its Covid-19 response, statist industrial policies, and rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.128

Even longtime advocates of U.S. engagement with China conceded that their approach had become outmoded.129 Whereas American policy-makers could justify dealing with a one-party state as long as China kept integrating with a rules-based international order and evolved toward political openness, Xi’s autocratic turn upended this bargain. “China continues to keep whole sectors of its economy off-limits to U.S. businesses, while expropriating American intellectual property and circumscribing the activities of American civil-society organizations, religious groups, media outlets, think tanks and academics,” said Orville Schell and Larry Diamond, lead authors of a 2018 report by prominent China scholars and former officials that urged firmer resistance against Beijing’s efforts to influence American society. “Getting China to agree to a new level of fairness and reciprocity may be exceedingly difficult and even create some risks, but it is the only path to a healthier, more durable relationship between the two countries.”130

Tensions came to a head in December 2018, when Canadian authorities—acting at Washington’s request—detained Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, while she was transiting through Vancouver. U.S. prosecutors wanted to extradite Meng, a daughter of Huawei’s founder, to face wire and bank fraud charges related to alleged violations of American sanctions on Iran. American officials hoped the case would aid their efforts to undercut Huawei, a global leader in developing fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless technology that can deliver ultra-high-speed connectivity, a sector where the U.S. has been laggard. The arrest took place the day when Trump was dining with Xi at a Group of Twenty summit in Buenos Aires, though White House officials made no mention of the case at the time—an omission that struck the Chinese leader as deceptive and insulting when he later learned of the arrest.131

For Xi, Trump’s trade war only reinforced his belief that China must become economically self-sufficient and globally dominant in strategic technologies.132 “Unilateralism and trade protectionism are on the rise, forcing us to take the road of self-reliance,” Xi said while touring China’s northeastern rust belt in 2018. “China ultimately has to rely on itself.”133 He outlined new efforts to boost domestic companies and consumption, with foreign investments and technologies playing a supporting role.134 His administration reined in private businesses to steer them closer to the party’s priorities, while boosting state-owned enterprises with hopes of creating new juggernauts in key industries.

In its broadest strokes, Xi’s strategy echoes past analyses by a leading member of his brain trust—Wang Huning, the party theorist who joined the Politburo Standing Committee in 2017.135 In a 1991 book, America Against America, which recounted his observations over six months in the U.S. from 1988 to 1989, Wang concluded that the world’s reigning superpower was riven with cultural flaws that could sow the seeds of its decline.136 American individualism, hedonism, and democracy would eventually blunt the country’s competitive edge, he argued, whereas rival nations powered by superior values of collectivism, selflessness, and authoritarianism would rise to challenge American supremacy.137

In some ways, China was already pushing ahead. Under Xi, the party poured massive resources into developing advanced digital technologies, aiming to become the world’s largest supplier of 5G network gear and create a “Digital Silk Road” lined with countries that use Chinese hardware and adopt its “Great Firewall” approach to managing the internet.138 Beijing also telegraphed ambitions to supplant the West in setting global industrial standards, and ensure that Chinese norms would shape key technologies of the future like artificial intelligence.139 By 2019, Chinese officials were leading four of the United Nations’ seventeen specialized agencies, with the most recent addition beating Western-backed candidates to take the top job at the Food and Agriculture Organization that year. No other nation had its citizens running more than one U.N. agency at that point, and it took a concerted U.S.-led lobbying campaign to block Beijing’s bid in 2020 to secure the leadership of a fifth body, the World Intellectual Property Organization, a role that went to a Singaporean candidate.140

U.S. antagonism against China went full throttle by the fourth year of Trump’s presidency. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo alleged that Covid-19 originated from a Chinese laboratory, denounced the Communist Party’s treatment of Uyghurs as genocide, and urged the Chinese people to alter the party’s behavior—remarks that Beijing saw as a call for regime change.141 Washington sanctioned Chinese officials who allegedly oversaw political repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, arranged high-level visits to Taipei, and sent more military forces to challenge Beijing’s sovereignty claims in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait.142 The Trump administration also widened its trade war into a broader struggle for technological supremacy, imposing export controls to cut off Huawei from advanced American know-how, excluding the company and other Chinese tech firms from U.S. telecom networks, and blocking Americans from investing in Chinese firms deemed to be aiding the People’s Liberation Army.143

China responded where it could. In March 2020, Beijing expelled more than a dozen American journalists after the Trump administration forced some sixty Chinese state media staffers to leave the U.S.144 The Chinese government imposed retaliatory sanctions on American officials seen as antagonizing China over human rights, while Chinese diplomats pushed conspiracy theories that Covid-19 came from a U.S. military laboratory in Fort Detrick.145 After Washington forced the Chinese consulate in Houston to shut down in July 2020, Beijing ordered the closure of the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.146

Joe Biden’s election as president brought little respite for Beijing. He declared that the U.S. would engage in “steep competition” with China, and charted a broad strategy for facing down the People’s Republic across economic, military, and diplomatic fronts.147 He extended some of Trump’s punitive measures against Chinese officials and companies, signed a new law aimed at boosting American semiconductor manufacturing, and curbed exports of advanced chips and chip-making equipment to China.148 Biden also beefed up U.S. security presence in the Indo-Pacific region, and pledged to team up with like-minded countries to pressure Beijing on security, trade, and human rights. Within the Washington beltway, many believe that the impulse to compete with, even contain, China has become an entrenched bipartisan program that will define American foreign policy for decades to come. “The danger for China is their own overreach. That’s what got America into trouble,” says Rhodes, the former Obama adviser. “The U.S. should figure out how to position itself to take advantage 30 years from now, when China is exhausted and overreached.”149

Beijing too has braced for a protracted struggle. Though the Chinese elite often deride the U.S. for its political dysfunction, many still accord begrudging respect for American power, and Xi himself has told officials that there are still areas where “the West is strong and the East is weak.” Speaking to Biden after his 2020 election win, Xi said he believed that U.S. efforts to rebuild its alliances were meant to “hurt China.”150 Such concerns would drive Xi to continue backing Russia, a strategic partner he had cultivated for years, even after Moscow drew widespread condemnation for invading Ukraine in 2022.151

China’s top diplomats threw down the gauntlet at their first meeting with Biden administration officials, held in Alaska in early 2021. Yang Jiechi, Xi’s foreign policy chief at the time, berated secretary of state Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan with lengthy lectures touting the superiority of China’s political system while skewering America for its racial problems and democratic failings. “The United States does not have the qualification to say that it wants to speak to China from a position of strength,” Yang said. “Our history will show that one can only cause damages to himself if he wants to strangle or suppress the Chinese people.”152

Yang’s true audience was at home. His remarks went viral on the Chinese internet, where Yang won praise for sticking it to the Americans. State media juxtaposed an image of the Anchorage meeting against a photograph from the signing of the 1901 Boxer Protocol, where Qing officials acquiesced to an unequal treaty with the Eight-Nation Alliance, which comprised the U.S. and other mostly Western powers.153 The message was clear: China considers itself a peer to the U.S., and the Americans had better do the same.





WHEN ELEPHANTS FIGHT


DURING A LIGHTER MOMENT at a gathering of Asian and European leaders in the summer of 2016, the Mongolian hosts staged cultural performances for their guests. Chinese premier Li Keqiang settled into a seat beside a fellow Asian leader, while a Mongolian official offered a running commentary on the displays. Wrestlers emerged at one point, dueling in pairs to demonstrate their art. No weight categories applied, and the wrestlers took on opponents of all sizes, the Mongolian official explained. “Sometimes the smaller ones win,” he said. Li wasn’t impressed, replying, “I don’t see any of the smaller wrestlers winning.” The Asian leader interjected: “The big are bullying the small.”154

Though speaking in jest, the Asian leader conveyed a sentiment felt among China’s neighbors since Xi Jinping took power. Just days earlier, an international tribunal in The Hague had issued a landmark ruling against Beijing, saying its claims to historic and economic rights over most of the South China Sea have no legal basis.155 China had snubbed the proceedings since they started in early 2013, insisting that the Permanent Court of Arbitration lacked jurisdiction over the case that the Philippines filed against Chinese sovereignty claims. Rather than fight a risky legal battle, Beijing spent the intervening years changing facts on the ground—reclaiming land around Chinese-controlled geographical features, fortifying these artificial islands with military assets, and using them to project power.156

Five Southeast Asian nations assert sovereignty and economic rights in the South China Sea that overlap with Beijing’s claims over the strategic waters, traversed by more than half the world’s seaborne trade and believed to hold vast energy resources.157 While some of these countries have also expanded the islands under their control over the years, China’s island-building campaign far outstripped any rival effort in pace and scale, adding some 3,200 acres of new land and a formidable array of airfields, air-defense systems, and anti-ship missiles.158 Some Southeast Asian governments joined the U.S. in accusing Beijing of fueling regional tensions, but Xi doubled down, insisting that islands in the South China Sea “have been China’s territory since ancient times.”159

When the Hague tribunal ruled against Beijing in July 2016, the Chinese government declared the decision “null and void” and continued reinforcing its islands.160 Rival claimants complained but could do little to compel China to abide by the ruling. Even the U.S., which sent warships and aircraft to challenge Beijing’s “excessive territorial claims” and assert “freedom of navigation” in the South China Sea, was otherwise powerless to reverse the fait accompli that Beijing had established. “That paper, in real life, between nations, is nothing,” then Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte, whose predecessor sought the arbitration, said of the ruling. “I will throw that away in the wastebasket.”161

Xi’s handling of the South China Sea disputes exemplifies his approach to foreign policy—an uncompromising pursuit of Chinese interests that excites nationalist passions but inflames geopolitical tensions. His style has also asked uncomfortable questions of the many countries that count China as their top trading partner while sheltering under an American security umbrella. As Washington and Beijing battle for preeminence, more governments face difficult reassessments on where they stand in this superpower showdown—whether they can tolerate an assertive China, or push back at the risk of incurring grave costs.

South Korea, a U.S. ally that trades more with China than it does with America and Japan combined, confronted this conundrum in 2017 after deploying an American ballistic missile defense system, known as THAAD, which came with a powerful radar that Beijing believed could glean intelligence on its nuclear weapons.162 China responded angrily with economic warfare. It blocked shipments of Korean consumer products, denied visas for K-pop artists, disrupted Chinese operations of a South Korean conglomerate that put up a golf course to host the THAAD system, and curtailed travel to South Korea—costing its tourism sector an estimated $7 billion.163

Seoul engineered a thaw by telling Beijing that it wouldn’t deploy additional THAAD batteries, wouldn’t join a U.S.-led missile defense network, and wouldn’t form a trilateral military alliance with the U.S. and Japan. At the same time, South Korean officials kept stressing their commitment to strong ties with the U.S.164 Asking whether South Korea will “choose either China or the United States” is like “asking a child whether you like your dad or your mom,” a senior legislator told the Atlantic magazine. “We cannot abandon economy for the sake of security, and we cannot abandon security for the sake of economy.”165

Australia, another U.S. ally reliant on Chinese trade, faced similar repercussions after Canberra blocked Huawei from its 5G networks, called for a global inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, and criticized the political repression in Hong Kong. Beijing fought back with informal sanctions—suspending beef imports from some Australian slaughterhouses, imposing tariffs on Australian barley and wine, and warning Chinese citizens not to travel to Australia.166 Beijing also detained a China-born Australian journalist working for Chinese state television, citing national security offenses, though her friends suspected that bilateral tensions were to blame.167 “China is angry,” a Chinese embassy official in Canberra told an Australian newspaper. “If you make China the enemy, China will be the enemy.”168

Canada strayed into the U.S.-China crossfire after arresting Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in 2018.169 Beijing saw her arrest as a provocation and promised “grave consequences” for Canada if Meng wasn’t released. Within days, China detained two Canadian citizens, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, who were later accused of conspiring to steal state secrets.170 Weeks later, a Canadian man jailed in northeastern China for smuggling drugs was retried and sentenced to death.171 Though Chinese officials denied engaging in “hostage diplomacy,” Beijing engaged in secret talks with Washington and Ottawa to secure Meng’s release in return for freeing Kovrig and Spavor. A deal was agreed to in 2021, and the two Michaels were released after 1,019 days of detention. Meng returned from Canada at the same time after she admitted to some wrongdoing, in exchange for U.S. prosecutors deferring and eventually dropping bank fraud charges against her.172

Lithuania suffered China’s wrath in 2021, when the tiny Baltic state of less than 3 million people decided to boost ties with Taiwan and withdraw from Beijing’s diplomatic platform for engaging with Central and Eastern European countries, known as China-CEEC.173 Chinese pressure intensified after Lithuania allowed the Taiwanese government to open a representative office—a de facto embassy—in Vilnius under the name of “Taiwan,” spurning the usual practice of calling it a “Taipei” office. China recalled its ambassador from Vilnius, declined to renew accreditation for Lithuanian diplomats, blocked Lithuanian companies and products, and even held up customs processing for European goods with Lithuanian-made parts—prompting the EU to launch a WTO case accusing Beijing of discriminatory trade practices.174

China’s exertions stirred apprehension in parts of Asia and Europe. Opinion polls showed unfavorable views of China reaching or hovering near historic highs across Australia, Canada, and South Korea in 2020 and 2021, mirroring the rise in tensions with Beijing.175 Australia signed up to a trilateral security partnership with the U.K. and the U.S., known as AUKUS, while the likes of Canada, South Korea, Vietnam, and New Zealand started joining activities arranged under the Washington-led Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, a four-nation platform comprising the U.S., Japan, India, and Australia.176 In 2022, the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia followed Lithuania in withdrawing from the China-CEEC platform, reducing what was once informally known as the “17+1” bloc to “14+1.”177 Across Africa, where many countries are major recipients of Chinese loans, citizens have increasingly voiced concerns about their governments’ high levels of indebtedness to Beijing.178

The contest for superpower proxies has grown particularly intense in Southeast Asia, a region of more than 600 million people sometimes called “the Balkans of Asia,” where great-power interests often intersect over shipping lanes and resources in the South China Sea. Although the U.S. asserts no claims in these waters, Washington has long declared its interests in ensuring peace and freedom of navigation across a key artery of global trade, whereas Beijing senses a hegemonic desire to preserve an American-led security order.

Modern Chinese claims in the area date back to the late 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang government published maps featuring an eleven-dash line that enveloped most of the South China Sea. In the years after the Communist Party seized power in 1949, Beijing dropped two dashes around waters off Vietnam, creating what became known as the “nine-dash line,” which loops around some 2 million square miles of maritime space—about 22 percent of China’s land area—and denotes broad claims that overlap with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei, and Indonesia.179 Beijing has neither published coordinates for the line nor explained what it means, and rival claimants can only guess. Does the line represent sovereignty claims over land features like the Spratly and Paracel island chains? Perhaps it demarcates a national boundary, implying that waters within the line are part of China’s territorial sea? Or does it reflect “historic” claims over the area and certain economic rights?

The ambiguity is useful for Beijing. “It allows China the flexibility to interpret its position to serve the audience at hand,” explained Gregory Poling, an expert on the South China Sea disputes at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “Without a defined Chinese position, resolving claims and reconciling positions is not possible.”180 By tying rival claimants down in protracted negotiations, Beijing also buys time to consolidate control over claimed territory in ways that other countries can’t challenge or reverse.181

China has also frustrated a cohesive Southeast Asian response by playing individual countries off each other. Cambodia and Laos, both recipients of Chinese largesse, often sided with Beijing during discussions on the South China Sea at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a ten-member bloc that operates by consensus. Beijing and ASEAN have yet to finalize a code of conduct for the South China Sea after agreeing to draft one in 2002, a delay Southeast Asian officials blame on Beijing’s stalling tactics. Even the Philippines, which filed for arbitration against China, reversed course in 2016 after electing a new president, Rodrigo Duterte, who tried to drum up Chinese investment by currying favor with Xi—thus playing into Beijing’s preference for facing down rival claimants in one-to-one talks.

The one ASEAN member that has spoken up most consistently on the South China Sea disputes, however, isn’t a claimant state. Singapore, a small island entrepôt turned financial hub that owes its success to maritime trade, insists on punctilious compliance with international law and fervently resists Beijing’s “might makes right” approach. For this city-state of 5.6 million people, it is a matter of life and death—without a rules-based international order, where nations big and small abide by the same principles, there can be no guarantees for its existence as a sovereign state.

It is a belief hard-baked into the psyche of Singaporean leaders by their country’s troubled birth. Singapore exited the British empire in 1963 to join the new Federation of Malaysia, but the union lasted just under two years before racial violence and political discord drove the city’s separation to become an independent state. Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s founding prime minister, had no illusions about the dangers his country faced—an anomalous Chinese-majority state in a region where most Chinese diaspora are minority groups. There were Cold War sensitivities to navigate too, thanks to the port city’s strategic location between the Pacific and Indian Oceans. “It is not due to any special virtue or attractiveness of my people that we receive considerable attention from the Americans, the Soviet Union, the Chinese and the Europeans, who were first there,” Lee told a 1973 gathering of national leaders from the British Commonwealth.182

When Australian prime minister Gough Whitlam remarked that Soviet ships couldn’t go to Singapore because the city-state has a large ethnic Chinese population, “the Soviet Union immediately diverted four Soviet tenders, feeder ships, to Singapore for repairs, to see whether we were Chinese or Singaporeans. We repaired them,” Lee said.183 “The fact is, as the President of Tanzania has said, when elephants fight, the grass suffers,” he said. “The thought occurred to me that when elephants flirt, the grass also suffers. And when they make love, it is disastrous.”184

Despite its anti-communist stance, Singapore started threading a middle path between capitalist America and socialist China, cultivating ties with both powers to advance its own interests. The city-state hosted U.S. military forces passing through the region and bought American arms for its own defense, but never became a formal ally with Washington. Singapore sought wide-ranging cooperation with Beijing, pouring investments into Chinese industrial and real estate projects. Its government encouraged Singaporeans to learn Mandarin—while discarding other Chinese dialects—in part as a language for doing business with China.185 The city-state has hosted more than fifty thousand Chinese officials for study visits and training programs since the mid-1990s, and maintained regular exchanges with some of the Communist Party’s most powerful and secretive agencies—including its top disciplinary and law-enforcement commissions, and its personnel department.186 And as China gained clout on the international stage, Singapore presented itself as a cultural gateway between East and West, hosting events such as the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual security conference that gathers defense chiefs and military brass from the Asia-Pacific and beyond, including the U.S. and China.

Singapore’s insistence on its autonomy has at times sparked spats with the U.S. and China. The city-state forced out a U.S. diplomat in 1988 for allegedly interfering in local politics, and caned an American teenager for vandalism in 1994 despite Washington’s pleas for clemency.187 When Singapore’s deputy prime minister Lee Hsien Loong went to Taiwan on a private trip in 2004, just weeks before he became premier, Beijing criticized what it saw as a violation of the “one China” principle and canceled some visits to Singapore, though relations recovered after Lee criticized advocates of Taiwan independence later that year.188 “This isn’t going to be the last time our relations with a major friendly power are strained,” Lee said in one of his first major speeches as prime minister.189

Beijing sometimes sees Singapore’s outspokenness as a nuisance. When Lee raised the South China Sea disputes at an ASEAN summit, a senior Chinese diplomat told a Singaporean counterpart that “silence is golden.”190 Tensions boiled over in 2016, when Lee urged compliance with the Hague tribunal ruling. “On the South China Sea, we have got our own stand, principled, consistent; different from China’s, different from the Philippines or America,” he said in a policy speech. “Other countries will persuade us to side with them, one side or the other, and we have to choose our own place to stand.”191

Lee’s remarks irked Chinese officials who felt that Singapore was acting in concert with Washington. That belief seemed to crystalize at the Non-Aligned Movement summit in September 2016, where ASEAN countries jointly proposed to revise the final communiqué to include concerns over South China Sea tensions.192 Chinese officials came to believe that the Singaporean delegation was lobbying to add references to the Hague ruling, a perception fueled by the fact that a Singaporean diplomat presented the ASEAN proposal, instead of a delegate from Laos, which held the ASEAN chairmanship at the time.193

Days later, the Communist Party–run tabloid Global Times published a report claiming that Singapore had lobbied in vain for references to the tribunal ruling to be included in the NAM summit communiqué, and that the Singaporean delegation made “hostile attacks” against other countries when its proposal was rejected.194 Singapore’s envoy to Beijing issued a rebuttal, criticizing the Global Times for publishing an “irresponsible report replete with fabrications” and pointing out that the proposed changes were collectively drafted by all ASEAN members. The Chinese foreign ministry echoed the Global Times account, accusing “individual countries” of trying to insert South China Sea–related content into the communiqué, while the newspaper’s chief editor stood by the report and accused Singapore of “damaging China’s interests.”195

Tensions flared higher in November, when Hong Kong customs officials seized nine Singapore army armored vehicles that were being shipped back to the city-state from Taiwan, where the Singaporean military has conducted training since the 1970s. Hong Kong held the vehicles for two months, saying the shipping firm lacked the permits for ferrying military gear. But many Singaporeans suspected ongoing tensions with Beijing had motivated the seizure, at least in part.196 The spat stirred public debate, with some Singaporeans accusing their government of needlessly antagonizing China—the city-state’s biggest trading partner. Politicians and establishment figures took pains to explain how Singapore’s interests are sometimes best served by standing up to Beijing. “Our government is not rash but the considerations are not just relations with China,” wrote the retired diplomat Bilahari Kausikan, who served as the Singapore foreign ministry’s top civil servant from 2010 to 2013. “If we allow ourselves to be intimidated by Beijing what do you think our immediate neighbors will think?”197

Bilateral ties have also been complicated by Beijing’s perceptions that Singapore is a “Chinese” society. Three-quarters of Singapore citizens are ethnic Chinese, mostly descendants of people who migrated from southern China over the past two centuries or so.198 Chinese state agencies routinely promote cultural exchanges by arranging for Chinese Singaporeans to visit their ancestral homes and attend classes on Chinese history and calligraphy. Encouraged by Xi to rally the Chinese diaspora behind Beijing’s interests, many mainland officials treat their Singaporean interlocutors as distant kin who should show fondness, if not loyalty, toward the motherland. “You’re also Chinese,” some would say to me when they learn that I’m from Singapore. “You should understand us better.”

Singaporean leaders insist that they are a multiracial country, and since Lee Kuan Yew met Mao Zedong in 1976, they have made it a point to speak English in formal engagements with Chinese counterparts. When Deng Xiaoping visited the island in 1978, Lee told him that Chinese Singaporeans were forging their own destiny and didn’t see themselves as “overseas Chinese.”199 Singapore was among the last nations in Southeast Asia to establish formal relations with China, doing so in 1990 only after neighboring Indonesia, a Muslim-majority country, restored suspended ties with Beijing.200 It was a conscious choice, Singaporean leaders say, to avoid being seen as a cat’s paw for China.

Ordinary Singaporeans, however, don’t necessarily subscribe to their government’s delicate balancing act. Public sentiment toward China diverges broadly along cultural, educational, and generational lines. Singapore’s colonial heritage, including British-style parliamentary and common law systems, means that many within the English-speaking middle class feel more affinity with the West than the People’s Republic, as do members of a ruling elite dominated by graduates of top American and British universities. Younger Singaporeans often grow up on eclectic diets of Western, Japanese, and Korean pop culture and are thus less persuaded by Chinese propaganda.

But China’s ethnocentric and anti-Western rhetoric have found an eager audience among older Chinese Singaporeans, many of whom were shaped by Lee Kuan Yew’s fiery advocacy of “Asian values” in opposition to Western liberalism. They delight in seeing Asians stand tall on the global stage, partake in a sense of Chinese civilizational pride, and echo Beijing’s narratives that reach them through Chinese state television programs and social media apps like WeChat.201 Many Singaporean entrepreneurs with interests in China sympathize with their Chinese partners’ political views. New immigrants from China, who arrived in large numbers over recent years to study and work in Singapore, created lively online communities where pro-Beijing views seep into local discourse. Such narratives often criticize Singapore’s strong ties with the U.S. and argue that a Chinese-majority state should be subservient to a “Greater China.”

In a 2021 Pew Research study of public opinion in seventeen advanced economies, Singapore was the only country where a majority of respondents—some 70 percent—voiced confidence in Xi’s handling of world affairs.202 Doublethink Lab, a Taipei-based research firm that studies influence and disinformation operations, ranked Singapore second most exposed to Beijing’s influence efforts in a 2022 index of thirty-six countries assessed for their susceptibility to Chinese narratives, trailing only Cambodia.203 China’s cachet in one of Asia’s most Westernized societies offers a warning for the U.S. and other liberal democracies, that the ideological norms underpinning the American-led world order aren’t necessarily self-evident, a former Singaporean diplomat told me. “If those who would champion ‘Western’ norms—such as rule of law, democracy, and sovereign equality—can’t even persuade Singaporeans that their vision of world order is preferable to the Chinese one,” he said, “then what chance do they stand with the developing world?”

Singapore has taken steps to counter Chinese interference. In 2017, the city-state expelled Chinese-American academic Huang Jing for allegedly working as an “agent of influence” for an unspecified foreign country—which some local officials privately identify as China, where Huang was born. A professor at Singapore’s Lee Kuan School of Public Policy at the time, Huang was accused of working with foreign intelligence agents in trying to sway the city-state’s foreign policy and public opinion by passing along purportedly “privileged information” to influential Singaporeans.204 Huang denied the allegations but acknowledged making “some mistakes, for which I should pay the price.”205 He spent a year working in the U.S. before moving to China to take up academic positions in Beijing and later Shanghai.

The tale took another twist in 2020 when the U.S. jailed one of Huang’s former PhD students for spying on Beijing’s behalf. Dickson Yeo, a Singaporean national, pleaded guilty to using a fake consulting business as a front for gathering sensitive information for Chinese intelligence services, which recruited him in 2015 while he was studying at the Lee Kuan Yew School.206 Huang rejected insinuations that he had recruited or “talent spotted” Yeo, telling me that U.S. law enforcement didn’t contact him over Yeo’s case.207 Even so, some analysts said the case raised concerns that Chinese spymasters were trying to recruit Singaporeans to take advantage of the country’s reputation for neutrality.208

Singapore passed an anti–foreign interference law in 2021, granting authorities sweeping powers to force internet service providers and social media platforms to turn over user data, remove content, and block accounts deemed to be participating in “hostile information campaigns.”209 While proposing the legislation, Singapore home affairs and law minister K. Shanmugam described how, during tensions with an unnamed country between 2016 and 2017, the city-state detected a hostile information campaign that tried to undermine its foreign policy with online commentaries and Mandarin-language videos aimed at swaying Singapore’s Chinese-speaking population.210

Officially, Singapore continued walking a careful line, empathizing with both American and Chinese perspectives while channeling concerns of smaller nations that would suffer most from a superpower conflict. “The status quo in Asia must change. But will the new configuration enable further success or bring dangerous instability?” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote in Foreign Affairs. “If Washington tries to contain China’s rise or Beijing seeks to build an exclusive sphere of influence in Asia—they will begin a course of confrontation that will last decades and put the long-heralded Asian century in jeopardy.”211

“The prospect of an Asian century,” Lee said, “will depend greatly on whether the United States and China can overcome their differences, build mutual trust, and work constructively to uphold a stable and peaceful international order. This is a fundamental issue of our time.”
