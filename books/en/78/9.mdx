“Long-term seclusion and self-isolation made China poor, backward and ignorant.… The lessons of history tell us that if we don’t open up, we can’t succeed.”

—Deng Xiaoping



The Chinese government waited till the last day of my work permit to tell me that I had to leave mainland China. My press credentials and residency visa were due to expire on August 30, 2019, the day before my fifth anniversary as a Beijing correspondent for the Wall Street Journal. The foreign ministry had renewed my papers well ahead of expiry in previous years, but this time, they kept an ominous silence on what had been a routine process, and ran the clock down to the final hours.

After a late night of tentative packing, I jolted awake when my phone rang shortly past 8 a.m. “I’m sorry to say that the foreign ministry has told me that they will not be renewing your press card,” my bureau chief said. “Right,” I replied. “I guess I really have to pack now.”

I didn’t know it then, but I had become the first Journal reporter to be denied a renewal of press credentials by the Chinese government since the newspaper opened its Beijing bureau in 1979, and the sixth foreign journalist to be forced out of mainland China in six years.1 There was no time to contemplate. My bosses decided that I shouldn’t overstay my visa—better to leave first and pick up the pieces later. I spent the next eight hours packing my bags to catch a flight to Hong Kong. Half a dozen colleagues came to my apartment to help box my belongings for shipment later. My bureau chief went to the foreign ministry to make a last-gasp plea, but could only meet junior officials who complained about my coverage and refused to mention my name.

The Washington Post broke the news of my expulsion as I headed to the airport late in the afternoon.2 Calls and text messages poured in from friends and fellow reporters. I had long believed that journalists should report the news and not become the story, yet I was watching myself making headlines one mobile alert at a time. While I was waiting to board my flight, Chinese state media announced that the Communist Party’s Central Committee would soon convene its first plenary meeting in more than a year and a half, an unusually long interval. My professional instincts kicked in, my thumbs tapping on my phone to crank out my last story from Beijing, right till the moment the plane lifted off the runway. I hadn’t planned on leaving, but if I had to go, I would go out writing.3

One month earlier, on July 30, the Journal had published an article that I cowrote outlining how Australian law-enforcement and intelligence agencies were scrutinizing one of Xi Jinping’s cousins, Ming Chai, as part of broader probes into organized crime, money laundering, and Chinese influence operations. My colleague, Philip Wen, and I reported that Chai had indulged in high-stakes gambling in his adoptive home of Australia, betting tens of millions of dollars at Melbourne’s Crown Casino over a number of years—a remarkable outlay that prompted authorities to look into the sources of his money and suspected links to criminal syndicates. We also revealed that Chai had flaunted his familial ties with Xi while seeking business opportunities in China, though there was no indication that Xi had done anything to advance his cousin’s interests, or had any knowledge of Chai’s business and gambling activities.4

China considers the private lives of senior leaders and their families to be off-limits for journalistic inquiry, especially reporting that exposes the enormous gaps between the party’s socialist rhetoric and the vast wealth amassed by members of the political elite. When we asked the Chinese foreign ministry to offer comment on the Ming Chai story before publication, ministry officials summoned my bureau chief for a late-night meeting, where they promised “serious consequences” if we went ahead with the report. They also singled me out as being “unfriendly to China,” apparently referring to an earlier story I wrote about Xi’s health and the party’s lack of clear succession plans.5

Seven years earlier, when the New York Times and Bloomberg News published investigative stories about the wealth of the families of Premier Wen Jiabao and Xi, who was vice president at the time, Beijing retaliated by refusing to grant new journalist visas to both organizations. But the reporters who wrote those stories suffered few direct consequences. One of them, Mike Forsythe, said in a tweet about my expulsion: “In a sign of how things have changed, when Bloomberg published its exposé of the extended Xi family wealth in 2012 (I was one of the reporters), not only was I not expelled but my China journalist visa was renewed for another year, with no fuss.”6

The party has only tightened its vise around foreign media since my departure. In the spring of 2020, China ejected at least eighteen journalists from three U.S. news organizations—the largest wave of expulsions since the Mao era and a stunning reversal of the efforts by Xi’s predecessor to allow more access for foreign press.7 Three of my colleagues were the first to go. Beijing revoked their visas in February over an allegedly derogatory headline on an op-ed published by the Journal’s opinion section, even though they had nothing to do with the article or its headline, which called China the “sick man of Asia”—a highly charged phrase that many Chinese see as a racist insult associated with their nation’s “century of humiliation.”

Then in March, after the Trump administration decided to force some sixty Chinese state media employees out of the U.S., Beijing revoked press credentials of more than a dozen American reporters working for the Journal, the Times, and the Washington Post. Chinese authorities also forcibly terminated the employment of at least seven Chinese staffers at foreign news outlets, including the Journal, the Times, and Voice of America.8 Most of them were “news assistants” or “researchers,” the euphemistic labels they adopt to skirt government rules that bar Chinese citizens from working as full-fledged reporters for foreign media. The move sent chills through the small community of Chinese researchers, who form the backbone of every foreign media outlet’s operations in mainland China, handling everything from administrative chores to front-line reporting.

Within weeks, the party had gutted the China bureaus of some of the most influential Western news organizations, leaving them with a handful of reporters and researchers to hold the fort. Beijing’s message was clear: what few freedoms that foreign media enjoyed in the country were entirely subordinate to the party’s interests. The party giveth and the party taketh away.

The expulsions marked the end of an era. While the party has never been particularly welcoming of foreign muckrakers, China had for decades made slow, sometimes bumpy, progress in opening up to outside scrutiny. When Beijing normalized ties with Washington in 1979, it allowed American news organizations to return to the mainland, setting up bureaus and bearing witness as Deng Xiaoping’s “reform and opening up” steered China toward capitalist-style modernity. Though conservative elders resisted his efforts, fearing that the influx of foreign influences would erode the party’s socialist ideals, Deng was adamant. “Because now for any country that wants to develop, staying isolated is impossible,” he told fellow elders in 1984. “The lessons of history tell us that if we don’t open up, we can’t succeed.”9

Reporting conditions were far from ideal in the early years. Authorities kept foreign journalists under close surveillance and barred them from venturing beyond Beijing without permission. Reporters were roughed up, denied visas, or expelled for crossing murky political “red lines.” The party eventually loosened some shackles as it grew more accustomed to managing Western newshounds, allowing the media to become the “informational lubricant” that helped China interact, trade, and become more economically connected with the outside world.10 In the run-up to the 2008 Beijing Olympics, China suspended some media controls to allow foreign reporters to travel across the country and conduct interviews without prior state approval, and made these changes permanent after the games concluded.11 Government harassment persisted, but many foreign correspondents came to believe that China was becoming, bit by bit, a more open society.12

That optimism swiftly dissipated under Xi Jinping. The new leader wanted to “tell China’s stories well,” which first and foremost meant asserting full control over the media and reining in journalists who strayed from the party line. Some of China’s most daring news outlets bore the early brunt of Xi’s crackdown. Southern Weekly, a newspaper in Guangdong province known for hard-hitting coverage, had its 2013 New Year’s editorial allegedly rewritten by the provincial propaganda chief, Tuo Zhen, who turned a call for stronger constitutional rights into a celebration of the party’s achievements.13 Southern Weekly staffers demanded Tuo’s resignation and protests broke out against state censorship, but their defiance did little to impede Xi’s campaign to subdue the news industry.

Xi insisted that all media should “bear the surname ‘party.’ ” Regulators ramped up internet censorship and punished a number of prominent Weibo microblog influencers for allegedly spreading rumors—a crackdown that helped tame an increasingly rambunctious online space.14 Authorities harassed, detained, and jailed journalists who questioned party narratives, and tightened control over commercial news outlets that once prided themselves on producing investigative and explanatory reporting. Party propagandists who did Xi’s bidding were well rewarded. Tuo, for instance, was promoted to vice minister at the party’s propaganda department, before being named chief editor and president of the People’s Daily. The pressure on Chinese media grew so suffocating that reporters quit the industry in droves. Some switched to better-paid jobs in public relations, while others left China to pursue graduate degrees. A friend of mine, just before moving to the U.S. for doctoral studies, offered pithy advice to journalist buddies he invited for a farewell dinner: “Watch yourselves.”

Foreign media also felt the heat. In late 2013, China threatened to eject nearly two dozen reporters from the New York Times and Bloomberg News by withholding renewals for their visas, though Beijing eventually extended their credentials after then vice president Joe Biden raised the matter with Xi during a trip to Beijing.15 In 2015, the Chinese government declined to renew press credentials for a French newspaper journalist who criticized the party’s Xinjiang policies, effectively expelling her.16 The same thing happened in 2018 to an American reporter for Buzzfeed News who wrote about state surveillance and religious repression in Xinjiang.17

Annual surveys by the Beijing-based Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China indicated that its members faced increasing intimidation from the government. One poll found that in 2020, nearly 40 percent of reporters surveyed said their sources had been harassed, questioned, or detained for speaking with them, up from 25 percent the year before.18 Journalists who traveled in Xinjiang independently of government junkets often ran into local officials and police officers blocking them from interviewing residents and intimidating the people who dared speak. Even ordinary Chinese have joined the fray, hounding foreign-media staffers who show up in their communities to cover natural disasters, industrial mishaps, and other mass-casualty events, and accusing them of smearing China.

The intimidation took a chilling turn after the 2020 expulsions. In August that year, authorities detained an Australian reporter working for Chinese state television, Cheng Lei, for allegedly endangering China’s national security. State security agents later tracked down two other Australian journalists in connection with the case, prompting Canberra to intervene and help the two reporters leave China—an episode that Chinese state media suggested was retaliation against Australian law-enforcement raids on Chinese journalists.19 Months later, authorities detained a Chinese citizen working for Bloomberg TV in Beijing, Haze Fan, also for alleged national security offenses (Fan, who was friends with Cheng, was released on bail in January 2022).20

In Hong Kong, where the media had long enjoyed more freedoms than on the mainland, authorities tightened press controls in the name of enforcing a 2020 national security law. Police rounded up media executives and journalists for allegedly threatening national security, prompting several local news outlets to shut down. Some reporters at Western organizations had their visa applications held up for months, or rejected outright. The New York Times moved its Asia-Pacific news-editing hub to Seoul from Hong Kong, citing the security law and deteriorating conditions for media.21

“The Chinese state continues to find new ways to intimidate foreign correspondents, their Chinese colleagues, and those whom the foreign press seeks to interview, via online trolling, physical assaults, cyber hacking, and visa denials,” the Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China said in a 2022 report. As visa restrictions and rising harassment drive more reporters away, it said, “covering China is increasingly becoming an exercise in remote reporting.”22

Some news organizations have adapted, and continued producing incisive coverage from long distance. But offshore news gathering, however well done, remains a poor substitute for boots on the ground. Fleshing out stories with journalistic “color,” the lucid details that humanize the news and pull in readers, becomes much more difficult. Finding sources and winning their trust is a lot harder without face-to-face contact, and conducting interviews by phone can expose sources to harm. Most journalists would prefer to travel the country, meet people, and experience daily living in the most tactile ways, to keep their fingers on political, economic, and social pulses in one of the world’s most consequential nations.

Even remote reporting has gotten harder. While the party has long maintained tight control over information, Xi has taken China to new levels of opacity.23 His demands for political discipline have made the black box of Chinese politics more inscrutable than ever, as officials grew even more tight-lipped and reluctant to engage with foreigners. His all-encompassing definition of national security spurred authorities to classify a widening range of information as confidential. Beijing enacted a new data-security law in late 2021, subjecting almost all data-related activities to government oversight, including the collection, storage, use, and transmission of information. Officials, scholars, and investors say their traditional playbooks for engaging Beijing and parsing its policies are no longer viable. “It’s very difficult to know who has what position within the party, and how decisions flow,” one senior Western business lobbyist told me. “There’s no clear nexus of decision-making. When you find the government person who’s responsible, they’ll just read you a document and refuse to engage.”24

Foreign businesses, investors, and researchers increasingly struggle to get useful and timely information, as Chinese entities err on the side of caution in assessing what constitutes sensitive data. Some financial databases stopped selling information to overseas customers, while ship-tracking services withheld data on vessels in Chinese waters from clients outside the country. Metals suppliers grew reluctant to provide details about their inventory, making it harder for foreign customers to plan production. Chinese regulators and securities-industry groups warned analysts against issuing comments that could trigger instability in the markets or broader society. Several prominent Chinese market strategists had their social media accounts suspended after they posted commentaries contradicting the party’s narratives on the economy.25

Data sources that foreign officials, activists, and journalists used for highlighting political repression in China have also dried up. Policy directives, procurement papers, and speeches often disappeared from Xinjiang government websites after reporters used them to piece together how the party ran its forced-assimilation campaign against Muslim minorities. In the summer of 2021, a government-run judicial database was purged of thousands of court documents related to cases of political dissent and subversion. Such censorship makes it much harder for outsiders to find information that can be used to pressure Beijing on human rights, says John Kamm, chairman of the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco–based group that advocates for political and religious detainees in China. “The disclosure rate of sensitive political cases is now zero.”

Academic and cultural exchanges have suffered too. Chinese universities tightened approval processes for scholars seeking to travel overseas or participate in Zoom calls with foreign counterparts. Strict Covid-19 border controls—which the party maintained until early 2023—disrupted travel into and out of China, drastically reducing opportunities for face-to-face interactions with foreigners. “Excessive management has cut us off from studying advanced ideas, research methods and political experiences from abroad,” wrote Jia Qingguo, a former dean of Peking University’s School of International Studies.26

I tried to warn about some of these consequences after the 2020 journalist expulsions, in the form of an online essay in Chinese ruminating on the impact of the forced exodus. I wrote it as a favor to a friend, who ran a popular WeChat social media account named qiangzhan waimei gaodi, or “seizing the foreign media high ground.” Often called qiangwaigao for short, the account had attracted a dedicated following among current and former Chinese journalists, including many with experience working for foreign media. My friend asked if I wanted to share my thoughts on the expulsions from the perspective of a foreign correspondent. I agreed to write something anonymously.

The result was a roughly 4,100-character essay, written for Chinese readers, in which I lamented the loss of seasoned reporters who can help international audiences learn about China. I explained how differences in Chinese and Western perspectives on the value and social purposes of journalism often lead to misunderstandings on how foreign media operates. Foreign reporters, I wrote, face many constraints in trying to produce balanced and objective coverage, while still ensuring that their stories are appealing, concise, and easily digestible for readers back home, particularly in an era of ever-shortening attention spans.27 I argued that most foreign reporters who write so-called “negative stories” about China aren’t trying to besmirch the country, but, more often than not, are analyzing events through their own perspectives, informed by cultural and social norms in their own countries.

For all their flaws and foibles, Western media correspondents still provide a crucial channel “for the outside world to understand China,” I wrote. “Reducing their opportunities to conduct on-the-ground interviews and report in China will only fuel misunderstandings and suspicions about China in the outside world.” I cited a Chinese idiom, huwei biaoli, that evokes a reciprocal relationship based on mutual accommodation and acceptance. China and the foreign media “should find a way to co-exist,” I said. “We live in chaotic times, and may there be an end to this night.”28

I used a pen name, dongxie xidu, which Chinese readers would recognize as a near-homophone for “eastern heretic, western venom”—the noms de guerre for two popular characters created by the famed Chinese martial arts novelist Louis Cha, better known as Jin Yong. Another iteration of this near-homophone translates as “writing in the east, reading in the west,” a phrase I use in social media biographies. Several attempts to publish the essay timed out—a typical snag for WeChat posts that feature sensitive content. We tried to sidestep censorship algorithms by replacing certain phrases with subtler alternatives, like “MZD” instead of “Mao Zedong,” to no avail. Eventually we gave up and published the essay as a private post, which would be automatically forwarded to readers who sent a certain password to the qiangwaigao account.

The essay went live late in the evening of March 22, 2020. Titled “A Letter from a Foreign-Media Reporter,” it ran up tens of thousands of clicks within hours, before maxing out the following day at “100,000+ views,” the highest tally that WeChat can display.29 Censors took down one version of the essay, but copies proliferated across Chinese internet forums, where users dissected the essay’s arguments. Some dismissed the essay as a self-serving whitewash of Western biases against China. Others sympathized with my views but insisted that Beijing had no choice but to expel American reporters—for anything less would be a dereliction of patriotic duty. “The essay is well-written but it doesn’t get to the key of the issue, the core of which is reciprocity” between China and the U.S., one reader said. “Keeps talking about why China shouldn’t expel them, why doesn’t he talk about what the U.S. did beforehand,” another wrote. “Isn’t this just double standards?”

The government took notice. Some officials asked Chinese journalists whether they knew the author’s identity. One foreign ministry staffer went on social media to criticize the essay for embodying a “holier than thou” attitude that he believed to be prevalent among foreign reporters. Some Chinese media outlets struck back with their own commentaries. The Paper, a Shanghai-based news portal, published an op-ed by an unnamed “person from the Chinese media industry,” who accused some Western media of perpetuating prejudice against China, and said the Chinese people were capable of discerning well-meaning foreign correspondents from malicious ones.30 A columnist for the website of the state-run Economic Daily newspaper justified the expulsion of American reporters as a reasonable response to Western bullying. “Foreign media should rub their eyes and understand clearly that the era of China ‘not fighting back when struck, not shouting back when abused’ is over,” the columnist wrote. “To foreign media, this is a dark night, an era of chaos. To me, this is the dawn, an era that nurtures order and beckons justice.”31

Xi’s demands on protecting national security and fanning patriotic fervor created a political environment where the outside world is increasingly regarded as hostile and belligerent.32 It’s a potent and self-reinforcing cocktail of digital autocracy and ethnocentric nationalism. State censorship helped stoke patriotic fervor online, often manifesting in a virulent “cancel culture” that drowns out dissenting voices. Ultra-nationalists wage social-media campaigns to boycott foreign brands accused of offending China, denounce dissidents, troll feminist and gay rights activists, and abuse journalists. Popular social media platforms, once seen as public squares that allow a measure of debate, are increasingly dominated by chest-thumping chauvinists, while liberal and moderate users retreat into private chatrooms.

Digital nationalism has become big business. Internet platforms promote patriotic content to drive traffic and rake in advertising fees. Influencers and live-streaming stars monetize their love for China with flag-waving displays.33 State media and party publicists, chasing clicks to prove their growing reach, indulge in triumphalist tropes that celebrate China’s achievements while denigrating other countries. Even academics and public intellectuals have joined in, garnering broad audiences on social media with saber-rattling rhetoric. The online jingoism grew so alarming that an informal collective of anonymous volunteers, known as “the Great Translation Movement,” started exposing the toxicity to the outside world by translating ultranationalistic commentary from Chinese social media and publishing it in English and other languages on Twitter—an effort that state media tried to discredit as a smear campaign against China.34

Amid such ferment, China’s distrust of the West has spilled well beyond the corridors of power and seeped into public discourse, fueling shrill rhetoric that often squeezes out reasoned arguments. Rising anti-China sentiment within Western policy circles also makes it harder for Beijing to offer compromises that many within the party elite and broader society may perceive as weakness. “The party can rein in this nationalism,” says Jessica Chen Weiss, a Cornell University scholar who studies the role of nationalism in Chinese foreign policy. “But doing so requires political capital that they may be unwilling or unable to spend.” Or as the Chinese saying goes, “If you ride the tiger, it’s hard to get off.”

Given China’s opaque authoritarian system, it is difficult to accurately assess the depth of public support for Xi and the Communist Party. Even so, what glimpses of popular sentiment we get on social media suggest many Chinese care deeply about their nation’s global standing, and how they are perceived by outsiders. Positive appraisals are welcomed for affirming China’s resurgence as a great power. Negative commentary, well intended or otherwise, is increasingly dismissed as smears by misguided and malicious people.

Xi insists that China will stay the course with “reform and opening up,” but where Deng once urged the party to “liberate thoughts,” Xi has ordered cadres to “unify thinking” and close their minds to “corrupt” foreign influences. His avowal of a rising East and declining West has become an article of faith within the party and beyond; questioning such views is almost tantamount to disloyalty. Much like how America’s “culture warriors” see their struggle in Manichean terms, many nationalistic Chinese embrace the party’s claims to leading an existential quest for national dignity and dominance. Compromise is often dismissed as weakness, cooperation derided as collusion.

As the British historian Robert Bickers writes, “nationalism matters in China, and what matters in China matters to us all.”35 Fired by historical grievances and a sense of civilizational destiny, Xi’s China is brash but brittle, intrepid yet insecure. It is a would-be superpower in a hurry, eager to take on the world while wary of what may come. It demands to be seen, heard, and respected, but obstructs outsiders who try to peer past the pomp and propaganda. It exerts a global reach with economic and military might, even as its ruling party retreats into an ideological cocoon. Its choices are reshaping the world, and it behooves us to grasp why and how. Understanding this powerful, opaque, and restless China has become harder than ever, but this is why we must try.
