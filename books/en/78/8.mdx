“When things are going well, people wish ‘long life’ to the paramount ruler; when they are going badly, people look forward to the arrival of the Grim Reaper.”

—Lucian Pye, American political scientist and sinologist


“One of these days Marx is going to call us over. Who knows if our successor might be a Bernstein, a Kautsky, or a Khrushchev?”

—Mao Zedong


“Building a nation’s fate on the reputation of one or two people is very unhealthy and very dangerous.”

—Deng Xiaoping



During China’s last imperial dynasty, Qing emperors held court at the Palace of Heavenly Purity, an imposing edifice of red walls and yellow-glazed roof tiles built upon a white marble platform deep inside Beijing’s Forbidden City. The monarch would consult courtiers and receive guests in its lavish main hall—still visible to tourists today—where his “dragon throne” sat on a dais decorated with intricate motifs and cloisonne incense burners. Above the seat of power hangs a horizontal tablet emblazoned with the calligraphy of Shunzhi, the first Qing emperor to reign over China, who wrote, zhengda guangming, or as one translation goes, “let the righteous shine.” Notwithstanding its appeal for forthrightness, the tablet once concealed the most sensitive of imperial secrets: the identity of the next emperor.1

The practice started with Yongzheng, who ascended the throne in 1722 after being named successor at the Kangxi emperor’s deathbed. The clandestine choice was born of bitter experience. Even though Kangxi designated a crown prince early in his reign, he vacillated on his decision as his many sons struggled for power, battling one another and even Kangxi himself, and threatening to unravel the Qing court from within. Yongzheng’s solution was to anoint his heir in secret. His choice was written on two documents, one kept on the emperor’s person and the other sealed in a box and placed behind the zhengda guangming tablet. Upon Yongzheng’s death, officials would open the box, compare the papers, and unveil the next son of heaven. This way, the monarch could reduce the risks of open conflict between potential heirs, avoid becoming a lame duck, and forestall a ruler-in-waiting from usurping power.

Three centuries later, China’s latter-day emperor seems to favor similar secrecy. Xi Jinping, leader of the world’s last major communist power, wields preponderant say over who would succeed him and when. But he declined to reveal his hand as he clocked in a third term as Communist Party chief in 2022, packing his leadership bench with allies who lacked the right combination of age and experience that would mark them out as viable successors.2 By exceeding the ten years he was originally expected to get in office, Xi breathed new life into an old poser in Chinese politics. “Who will be the next leader of China? This question has been a perpetual preoccupation of scholars and journalists for decades, and the reason is clear,” Bruce Dickson, a China politics scholar at George Washington University, wrote in 1997. “In one form or another, the succession issue has been the central drama of Chinese politics almost since the beginning of the People’s Republic in 1949.”3

For Xi, this is a mystery by design. Few people, if anyone, and possibly not even Xi himself, know how long he wants to stay in power. Nor has he made clear if, when, or how he would designate an heir. Xi may have a timeline in mind, but changing circumstances could force him to rethink those plans. The uncertainty keeps the party elite on their toes, helping Xi maintain control and buying him time to assess potential successors. But keeping the suspense for too long could backfire, alienating protégés and antagonizing enemies enough to undermine the leader or even sow the seeds for a coup d’état. Xi, whose family suffered the vicissitudes of party infighting, knows this risk all too well.

During Mao Zedong’s mercurial rule, one would-be successor was purged and tortured before dying in detention, while another perished in a plane crash after allegedly leading a failed attempt to seize power. The eventual successor, Hua Guofeng, toppled a rival faction led by Mao’s wife Jiang Qing—the Gang of Four—before he himself was ousted by Deng Xiaoping. And although Deng developed norms for power-sharing and timely retirement, he ended up purging two protégés and dominating politics until his death in 1997.

For a while, nonetheless, China seemed to have cracked the succession code. Deng’s passing spurred an outpouring of emotion but no political turmoil, with his successor Jiang Zemin already well ensconced as party chief. The next two leadership handovers also proceeded with relative calm, despite some intrigue along the way, persuading some scholars that the Communist Party was at last capable of regular, predictable, and peaceful transfers of power.

But the notion of institutionalized succession proved illusory. Since becoming party chief in 2012, Xi has accrued personal clout to a degree unseen since Mao. He designated himself the party’s “core” leader and greatest living theorist, ensuring that he would remain China’s preeminent politician until he passes on, or as party insiders say, “goes to see Marx.” He scrapped term limits on the presidency, and upended retirement norms honed by his predecessors—obliterating the most important political reforms of the post-Mao era.

Succession is a high-stakes game in any political system. As Donald Trump showed with his attempts to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, leadership changes can prove precarious even in democracies with established procedures for transferring power. In China, the dangers of power struggles remain vivid memories for people who lived through the Mao and Deng eras, as well as the Soviet collapse, which Xi blames in part on bungled successions that allowed the rise of weak leaders not “man enough” to save the regime.4 A twenty-first-century succession crisis in China—with one of the world’s biggest populations, the second largest economy, and one of the most powerful militaries—would unleash global shock waves. It may even bring down the People’s Republic.

For Xi, a leader seemingly fixated on his place in history, the ability to engineer a smooth succession could determine whether his vision of a rejuvenated China would survive him. The party exalts Xi as the linchpin in China’s renaissance, and justifies his strongman style as a stabilizing force in a tumultuous world. He takes credit for all major policies and every instance of national success. But his top-down control suppressed initiative and flexibility, while encouraging rote compliance and red tape. Although Beijing claimed success in weathering global shocks, including Trump’s trade war and the Covid-19 pandemic, the party remained mired in bureaucratic rigidity, impeding decisive solutions for China’s long-term challenges. Even Xi himself has complained that progress often doesn’t come unless he intervenes with direct orders.5

Xi may have delivered the semblance of steady governance, but stability isn’t the same as resilience. As demonstrated by the Soviet collapse, which many in the West failed to foresee, a seemingly sturdy government can prove surprisingly fragile.6 “Our party is the world’s largest political party,” Xi once told officials. “I think the only ones who can defeat us are ourselves, nobody else.”7 By remaking the party around himself, Xi may have become the weakest link in his quest to build a Chinese superpower.





SUCCESSION STRUGGLES


CHINA’S RULERS HAVE GRAPPLED WITH the succession problem since antiquity. Many emperors tried the principle of dizhangzi primogeniture, whereby the empress’s firstborn male would become the heir. Some picked the worthiest among all their sons, or sometimes younger male relatives. Almost all of them preferred relinquishing power upon their natural deaths, barring assassinations and coups, though a few abdicated voluntarily.8 A lasting solution, however, would elude Chinese monarchs through the ages, who instead bequeathed a blood-soaked history of power struggles and palace intrigue.

The Qing dynasty tried a mix of succession principles drawn from ancestral practice and shaped by contemporary circumstances. Its ruling clan of Aisin Gioro had followed a tradition of tanistry, whereby prospective heirs competed for power and ensured that only the strongest would reign.9 Nurhaci, the ruler of the Jurchen people who would establish the Qing, left his dominions to his many sons when he died in 1626, having encouraged them to rule collectively.10 His eighth son, Hong Taiji, emerged as khan with backing from key princes, renamed his people the Manchu, and proclaimed his realm as the “Great Qing.”11 Hong Taiji’s death in 1643 prompted a negotiated succession, whereby a council of Manchu princes settled on his ninth son, five-year-old Fulin. The Manchus captured Beijing the following year, and Fulin reigned over China as the Shunzhi emperor until his death from smallpox in 1661.12

Shunzhi’s third son, Xuanye, a smallpox survivor, ascended the throne before he turned seven. He took Kangxi as his regnal name and ruled for six decades, beginning a golden era of prosperity and territorial expansion that historians call the “High Qing.” Kangxi nodded to Han Chinese customs by designating an heir, naming one-year-old Yinreng as crown prince. But the decision backfired as his sons split into cliques and battled for power, a decades-long struggle enshrined in Chinese folklore as jiuwang duodi, or “nine princes seizing the throne.” Kangxi twice deposed Yinreng as crown prince over his moral frailties before settling on his final choice in secret, a decision revealed shortly before the emperor expired: the fourth prince, Yinzhen, would succeed him.13

Yinzhen reigned as the Yongzheng emperor for nearly thirteen years, though his claim to the throne was shrouded in controversy. Rival brothers questioned his legitimacy, and popular myths—still repeated today—allege that Yinzhen had usurped the throne by doctoring Kangxi’s edict to change the successor’s identity from the fourteenth prince, Yinti, to himself.14 The fratricidal conflicts with his brothers scarred Yongzheng, who decided to keep his choice of heir secret. His system helped put the succession issue to rest for well over a century, and marked a useful compromise between Han and Manchu traditions. The emperor got to name his heir, as the Han did, and was free to choose the most worthy one, as the Manchu preferred.

In practice, the secret selection system was never truly tested. Yongzheng’s fourth son, Hongli, was the clear favorite and his ascension as the Qianlong emperor came as no surprise. Qianlong outlived his first two choices of successor and became one of the world’s longest-reigning monarchs. He abdicated in 1796 as a filial gesture to avoid surpassing Kangxi’s sixty-one-year reign, but held on to power for three more years as emperor emeritus, while allowing his fifteenth son to start a new reign. Two more monarchs were named via secret selection, though the latter had only one surviving son, who ruled as the Tongzhi emperor and died—aged eighteen—with no offspring. Tongzhi’s mother, Empress Dowager Cixi, installed a nephew as the Guangxu emperor and wielded power as regent. When Guangxu expired childless in 1908, a dying Cixi enthroned a toddler, Puyi, who became the last emperor of China.15

The Qing collapse triggered decades of civil conflict, during which the Communist Party was born. These Marxist revolutionaries fared little better at succession than their feudal forebears. The party leadership changed hands many times in the early decades, and often the person holding the party’s most senior post wasn’t its most powerful leader. Mao seized effective control over the party at a 1935 conference, where he blamed the incumbent leaders for the Red Army’s losses against the Kuomintang. Though Mao started chairing the Central Military Commission the following year, he only became the party’s top political officeholder in 1943, when he was named chairman of the Politburo.

Mao’s twenty-seven-year reign over China was marred by incessant infighting as his radical campaigns ravaged the country. Though he tried to designate a successor, Mao often worried whether his legacy could survive him, having seen what happened after Stalin’s death in 1953. Nikita Khrushchev, who won the ensuing power struggle to become Soviet leader, repudiated Stalin and his cult of personality in a 1956 “secret speech” that stunned the communist world. It was an object lesson for Mao—a mishandled succession could destroy his achievements. “One of these days Marx is going to call us over. Who knows if our successor might be a Bernstein, a Kautsky, or a Khrushchev?” Mao told the Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh in 1966.16 Or as Mao told close associates on his seventy-third birthday later that year, the enemies who would betray his revolution lie deep inside the party, for “the fortress is easiest to capture from within.”17

Mao’s first heir apparent was Liu Shaoqi, a veteran revolutionary who became the party’s first-ranked vice chairman in 1956 and head of state three years later. But Liu’s relationship with Mao soured as they clashed over policy in the early 1960s, and Liu was among the first senior officials to be purged during Mao’s Cultural Revolution. The party dismissed Liu as vice chairman, denounced him as a “capitalist roader,” and expelled him before he died from maltreatment in 1969.

In Liu’s place, Mao promoted Lin Biao, a revered military commander and defense minister, as heir apparent. A Mao loyalist who scored decisive battlefield victories during the Chinese civil war, Lin distinguished himself through obsequious displays of fealty, having popularized the “little red book” of Mao’s quotations within the armed forces before it became ubiquitous in the hands of Red Guards. Lin earned a formal designation in the party charter as Mao’s “close comrade-in-arms and successor” in 1969, only to die two years later in a mysterious plane crash in Mongolia. The party denounced Lin posthumously as a traitor, saying that he was trying to flee to the Soviet Union after botching a coup attempt against Mao. Some historians have questioned this account, though no conclusive explanations have emerged for the “Lin Biao incident.”18

Whatever the truth, Lin’s death stunned China and sent Mao into a spiral of depression and deteriorating health.19 Some party insiders believed that Mao would pick a successor from the Gang of Four, who were the Cultural Revolution’s most fervent enforcers. But the ailing dictator ultimately went with Hua Guofeng, a former regional administrator who succeeded Zhou Enlai as premier.20 Mao’s death in September 1976 sparked a tense interregnum. Hua and other party elders feared that the Gang of Four would seize power, and so they struck first, arranging for Jiang Qing and her clique to be arrested in a bloodless coup. But Hua didn’t last long, outmaneuvered and eased out of power by Deng Xiaoping, whose rehabilitation Hua had approved.

Under Deng, the party elite unified in their desire to prevent another Mao-style dictatorship. “The history of socialism in the past sixty years makes it plain that whenever there is a system of life-tenure for the highest party and state leaders, [a cult of personality] commonly occurs,” Yan Jiaqi, a senior party researcher, said in 1979. “Although it begins with an emphasis on collective leadership and the promotion of democracy, it culminates in an arbitrary rule that destroys collective leadership while safeguarding the power of the individual.”21 To forestall such developments, Deng enacted a history resolution to entrench his reformist ideas, encouraged timely retirement for senior leaders, and imposed term limits on the presidency, premiership, and other key state offices. The practice of life tenure “is detrimental for the renewal of leadership and the promotion of younger people,” Deng said. “Therefore, we say it would be better for us old comrades to set an example and take an enlightened attitude.”22

Though Deng declared that “a leader who picks his own successor is perpetuating a feudal practice,” he went on to do precisely that.23 He installed Hu Yaobang as party chief in 1981, but Hu irked party conservatives with his liberal leanings and lost his job after failing to contain student protests in 1986 and 1987. Another Deng protégé, Zhao Ziyang, stepped up as general secretary but he also clashed with hardliners. Party infighting boiled over after Hu died in April 1989, spurring mass mourning on Tiananmen Square that morphed into popular protests demanding greater political freedoms. Zhao opposed calls to forcefully suppress the unrest, and even showed up at the square one early morning in May to make a last-gasp plea for protesters to end a hunger strike. It was his final public appearance, before Deng ordered a military crackdown and purged Zhao.

Forced to designate an heir for the third time, Deng picked Jiang Zemin, then Shanghai’s party boss, as a compromise choice for general secretary. Deng resolved to get things right, urging the party to rally around Jiang as the “core” of its third-generation leadership, while he himself stepped back from front-line politics. “Now it seems that I carry too much weight, which is detrimental to the nation and the party, and one day it would be very dangerous. Many countries have set their China policies on the prospect of my illness or death,” Deng told senior officials in June 1989. “Building a nation’s fate on the reputation of one or two people is very unhealthy and very dangerous. That’s alright as long as nothing goes wrong, but once something happens, the situation can get out of hand.”24

Deng relinquished his last leadership post, stepping down as chairman of the Central Military Commission. But he remained China’s most powerful citizen, revitalizing stalled economic reforms through his “southern tour” in 1992. That year, Deng also approved Hu Jintao’s elevation into the Politburo Standing Committee, effectively designating him as Jiang’s heir and China’s fourth-generation leader. By deciding two successions down the line, Deng was giving the party every chance to make its leadership transitions regular and predictable.

Deng’s succession plans survived his death in February 1997, though Jiang tinkered with the process to boost his own authority. At the party congress later that year, Jiang forced a key rival in the Politburo Standing Committee, Qiao Shi, into retirement by insisting that officials aged seventy or older couldn’t start a new term in the leadership. Though Jiang was already seventy-one then, he was exempted on the grounds that he was the incumbent leader.25 Jiang reprised this tactic five years later at the 2002 party congress, lowering the retirement threshold to sixty-eight years to push out another rival, Li Ruihuan, from the Politburo Standing Committee.26 Insiders dubbed this new precedent qishang baxia, or “seven up, eight down,” which meant officials aged sixty-seven or younger could start a new term, whereas those aged sixty-eight or older would retire.

Jiang stepped down as general secretary in late 2002 and president in early 2003, handing both posts to Hu. But Jiang stayed on as military commission chairman for two more years. This Deng-style power play allowed Jiang to retain influence and spoke volumes of Hu’s tenuous authority. Even so, the handover proceeded smoothly enough to persuade some Western scholars that political succession in China was increasingly bound by rules and norms.27

Xi’s ascension proved to be the party’s cleanest transfer of power to date. Unlike Jiang, Hu relinquished his key posts on time, stepping down as general secretary and military commission chairman at the 2012 party congress and handing over the presidency the following spring. For just the second time, the People’s Republic completed a leadership transition triggered neither by the leader’s death nor a political crisis. “Succession itself has become a party institution,” a pair of China scholars wrote, echoing what was then the broad academic consensus.28

Xi upended these expectations in just five years. He declined to elevate a potential successor into the Politburo Standing Committee at the 2017 party congress—the first clear sign that he was preparing to retain power beyond the ten-year leadership cycle that Hu had set. Then Xi repealed presidential term limits the following spring, surprising ordinary Chinese and even party insiders. Just months before, in late 2017, one of China’s top constitutional scholars, Han Dayuan, had published an article saying that term limits had effectively curbed the party’s problems with life tenure, overconcentration of individual power, and personality cults—the very issues that Xi came to embody.29 By the 2022 party congress, Xi’s authority had grown so entrenched that he was able to completely discard the “seven up, eight down” guideline, claiming his third term as party chief at the age of sixty-nine, forcing rivals into early retirement, and keeping older loyalists in the party’s top echelons.30

Officials defended Xi’s maneuvers as necessary for overcoming bureaucratic stasis, and denied any restoration of life tenure for party and state leaders. These claims offered little comfort for those who feared a return to Mao-style dictatorship. Xi’s dominance meant he would be the first leader since Deng to enjoy a free hand in picking his heir. The choice would be pivotal, and Xi was keenly aware of the stakes. “Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,” Xi said, “requires cultivating generations upon generations of reliable successors.”31 Unfettered by term limits, he can take as long as he needs to decide.





WHO’S NEXT


FOR CHINA’S RULERS, the question of succession is also a matter of legacy. “No leader, not even a Mao or a Deng, can leave behind statutes that will bind the country to any particular policy course. New rulers bring new policies,” the American political scientist Lucian Pye wrote in explaining why debates over succession dominate Chinese politics. “As long as leaders’ influence ends at the grave, it is natural for them to try to hold on to power for as long as possible.”32

Mao did reign till the bitter end, while Deng retained his political preeminence until his death. Xi can follow similar paths, with the party canon of “Xi Jinping Thought” giving his words the strength of holy writ. He could try to keep a formal hold on power for life, like Mao did. Or he may decide to step back and rule from behind the scenes as a regent, à la Deng, whereby he can assess his heir apparent’s performance and intervene when necessary, or even pick a new successor altogether.33

On paper, the party prohibits life tenure. The party charter states that cadres in leadership positions “do not hold posts for life and can be transferred from or relieved of their posts.”34 The party also has interim regulations that bar officials in leadership roles from staying in the same post beyond ten years, or at the same level of the party for more than fifteen years. But some insiders say these rules don’t apply to the top leadership, and in any case, Xi secured a third term as general secretary in 2022 with what officials hailed as unanimous support.35 Age wasn’t the main factor in how the party chose its new leadership that year, according to an authoritative state media account of the process. Rather, it said, top party and state appointments must be decided “in accordance with work requirements, personnel criteria, integrity, and reputation.”36 In essence, Xi can stay on as party chief, military commission chairman, and state president for as long as he wishes.

Xi confronts a timeless conundrum that scholars call the “successor’s dilemma.” Autocrats prefer installing successors whom they trust to uphold their legacy and protect their interests in retirement. But leaders-in-waiting must start building their own power base ahead of time, if they are to avoid being deposed or rendered ineffectual after taking office. And once a clear successor emerges, the political elite will naturally start realigning their loyalties—a process that can undermine the incumbent leader, who may come to fear that the heir apparent is plotting to usurp power.

Whereas politicians in many democracies are generally confident that they can continue to enjoy personal liberty after leaving office, authoritarian leaders expect grave consequences should they lose power involuntarily. Even autocrats who retire on their own terms have few guarantees for their safety, other than their ability to maintain leverage over their successors. According to a 2010 academic paper that reviewed the fate of more than 1,800 political leaders, some 41 percent of the 1,059 autocrats analyzed suffered exile, imprisonment, or death within a year of leaving office, compared to just 7 percent of 763 democratic leaders.37

Xi could mitigate such threats by establishing a framework for relinquishing power. In an authoritarian system that offers clarity on succession timelines, the political elite can calibrate expectations on their career advancement, and thus feel less inclined to challenge the incumbent ruler. If regime insiders see bleak prospects for promotion, or start fearing for their personal safety, they may decide that their best bet is to oust the leader, whether through a procedural challenge or an outright coup. Succession rules “reduce elites’ incentives to try to grab power pre-emptively via forceful means,” wrote Erica Frantz and Elizabeth Stein in a paper analyzing why autocratic leaders agree to succession rules that could curtail their authority.38

Chinese history is rich with succession drama that serves as a guide. Reviewing data on the 282 emperors who reigned across 49 dynasties since Qin Shi Huang unified China, Harvard political scientist Yuhua Wang found that only about 46 percent of them designated a successor, while the rest either didn’t have a son or relied on other rules of succession. “Emperors who designated a competent and loyal successor lived longer,” Wang wrote, noting that monarchs who anointed heirs apparent were 64 percent less likely to be deposed than those who didn’t.39

Xi has said little publicly on succession planning, apart from broad platitudes on the need to groom good heirs to the revolution. Having antagonized many within the party elite with his anticorruption crackdown and political purges, he would likely want ironclad guarantees for his safety before stepping down. He could cling on to power for as long as possible without anointing an heir, but that means forsaking his prerogative to install a successor who can protect his legacy. Another possibility is that Xi may struggle to find suitable heirs and end up exiting office—through death or incapacitation—without a successor in place. “Presumably Xi Jinping doesn’t want to stay in power forever, and he does want to pick someone that he trusts to replace him, but at the same time, he understands that he could pick the wrong person, and the very act of picking the wrong person could create problems for the system,” says Joseph Torigian, a historian at American University who has studied power struggles in China and the Soviet Union. A situation therefore may arise where Xi wants to leave office but he feels that he can’t, Torigian says.40

Another factor in Xi’s succession planning would be how much time he believes he needs to achieve his goals. Although he would be seventy-four by the end of his third term as party chief in 2027, Xi would still be two years younger than Jiang Zemin was when he stepped down as general secretary in 2002. Some party insiders say Xi could choose to stay on until at least 2035, the target date for completing some of his signature initiatives, including economic development and military modernization. Xi would be eighty-two by then, around Biden’s age at the end of his first presidential term.

To ensure a smooth transition, Xi would need to prepare potential successors for the stresses of high office. In practice, this means giving them a stint in the Politburo Standing Committee, where they can start learning how to helm the ship of state. Once Xi makes his choice, the heir apparent would then likely be named vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and deputy head of state. If and when Xi feels confident enough to hand over his leadership posts, he could continue exerting influence from behind the scenes, mentoring or even deposing his chosen heir if he sees fit.

Supreme power in China hasn’t always been vested in formal titles. Deng famously never held office as the head of the party, government, or state, though as paramount leader he retained a crucial post as chairman of the Central Military Commission. Xi, on the other hand, has placed great premium on leadership titles, in part because he lacked other sources of legitimacy. Unlike Mao and Deng, who boasted revolutionary pedigree and wielded personal clout, Xi exercises power through his formal offices and the institutions those positions command. His successor faces the same problem, something Xi would likely consider in deciding if, when, and how to relinquish his titles. Some party insiders suggest that Xi could resurrect Mao’s title of party chairman, possibly as a titular post he could hold for life, while handing over day-to-day responsibilities to his chosen heir.

Who could succeed Xi? Much attention has fallen on senior officials in the party’s “post-60” generation, who were born in the 1960s and are expected to take over from Xi and his “post-50” cohort, in accordance with past expectations of a ten-year leadership cycle. Some of Xi’s post-60 protégés already hold senior party and government roles, and could emerge as likely successors at the subsequent party congresses in 2027 or 2032. Xi could also skip over the post-60 generation and groom heirs from among younger officials.

Xi has shown little desire to revive dynastic rule in China. His daughter and only child isn’t known to be pursuing a political career, which in any case would be challenging in a male-dominated and patriarchal party. Xi does have a nephew—a son of his younger brother—who ventured into public service, becoming the first of Xi Zhongxun’s grandchildren known to have entered government. Family friends say Xi Jinping meets the nephew, Qi Mingzheng, from time to time and seemingly trusts him to provide a relatively unvarnished picture of public sentiment. An alumnus of Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service and Tsinghua, Qi joined China’s main antitrust regulator as a junior bureaucrat in 2020 and has taken secondments as a rural official in a poor agricultural county just north of Beijing—echoing Xi’s early political career, when he was a county chief in the early 1980s.

Descendants of party elders have joined politics before. Hu Jintao’s son, Hu Haifeng, was a municipal party boss as of this writing; a son of former premier Li Peng became transport minister; and Bo Xilai, a son of a revolutionary hero, joined the Politburo before he was purged in 2012. Some liberal-minded princelings say they worry that Qi’s budding political career represents a broader attempt to ensure that China will continue to be governed by people with “red genes,” contrary to the party’s egalitarian values. Regardless, given his relative youth as a millennial born in 1992, Qi must still spend decades proving his mettle and scaling the hierarchy before he can reach the party’s top echelons.

Strongman leaders prefer pliant successors who won’t outshine or betray them. Whomever Xi chooses as heir may well be a relatively weak ruler who struggles to assert himself. “The death of a strong leader is always followed by a period of oligarchy, usually called ‘collective leadership,’ ” argued Yan Jiaqi, the former party researcher, who went into exile after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. The collective would likely be stricken by power struggles, he said, before “a personal dictatorship again emerges from the collective leadership.”41





GOING TO SEE MARX


WHEN XI JINPING EMBARKED ON a whirlwind tour of Italy, Monaco, and France in early 2019, his hosts feted him with ceremonial welcomes and state banquets—lavish pageantry designed to boost his image as a statesman. For some observers, however, it was his unusual gait that caught the eye. Television footage showed Xi walking with a slight limp while inspecting honor guards and touring local sights.42 At a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in the city of Nice, Xi gripped both arms on his chair to ease himself into his seat.43

The images stirred speculation among politically minded Chinese, foreign diplomats, and China watchers, who wondered if Xi had an ailment that was causing him physical discomfort. Guessing games played out on Twitter and overseas Chinese media, offering theories from muscle sprains to gout. In private social media chat rooms, some Chinese intellectuals gossiped about what the videos suggested about Xi’s health, a retired politics professor in Beijing told me. “Everyone didn’t say much, but there was a tacit mutual understanding.”44

Speculating about the health of authoritarian leaders is an old sport. For seasoned analysts, the practice goes beyond idle gossip and into the realm of painstaking research, with countless hours spent scrutinizing officials’ appearances and remarks for clues on their well-being and their government’s inner workings. China specialists often refer to such work as Pekingology—the Chinese equivalent of Kremlinology—or, more evocatively, the art of “tea-leaf reading.”

The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, for instance, prepared detailed studies on the implications of Chinese leadership changes, including analyses on what might happen after the deaths of Mao and Deng. A CIA paper issued in August 1976, the month before Mao died, anticipated that Mao would “soon be totally incapacitated or dead” and mapped out a range of possible scenarios that could follow, including a coup or a tenuous governing coalition between rival factions.45 A U.S. intelligence report issued in 1986 titled “China After Deng: Succession Problems and Prospects” advised against American efforts to influence the succession process, as such attempts “could probably only affect the succession in a negative way, by destabilizing relations with China.”46

Foreign intelligence agencies stepped up their scrutiny of Xi’s health after he repealed presidential term limits in 2018, according to a researcher who discussed the issue with intelligence officials from two governments. “Their concern is that the party doesn’t have a well-thought-out succession plan,” the researcher told me. “We can’t say we know what would follow if something happens to Xi.”47 Even some of Xi’s most fervent supporters have implicitly acknowledged such concerns. “Doesn’t the emperor of Japan rule for life? Doesn’t the Queen of England rule for life? So why can’t our chairman rule for life?” said Chen Jinshi, a real-estate mogul and member of China’s legislature. “As long as [Xi’s] health is good, what’s there to be worried about?”

China’s leaders receive the highest standard of healthcare through a dedicated medical system, and their physical conditions are considered state secrets.48 For Xi, projecting healthy vigor is vital for sustaining his aura of preeminence and keeping potential challengers at bay. As it would be with any system, democratic or authoritarian, information about an official’s health can become leverage in palace intrigue. During the August 1991 coup against the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, the conspirators issued media reports claiming that Gorbachev had been incapacitated by poor health.49

Beijing is therefore highly sensitive to media coverage about Xi’s health. After I wrote a report for the Wall Street Journal in 2019 discussing speculation about Xi’s health and concerns over leadership succession, the Chinese foreign ministry complained to my bureau chief, suggesting that such reports were irresponsible.50 During a 2020 speech in Shenzhen that was broadcast live, Xi repeatedly coughed and stopped to drink from a cup, prompting state television to cut away from him and show the audience instead—an episode that sparked online chatter about whether Xi was sick.51 Even an extended absence of Xi images from television news bulletins and People’s Daily front pages has proved enough to fuel wild rumors on Twitter and overseas Chinese media about Xi’s physical and political well-being.

Speculation over Xi’s health has simmered from time to time. In September 2012, just months before he took power, Xi canceled meetings with foreign dignitaries and failed to appear in public for about two weeks, prompting rumors that he had a health problem.52 Details about Xi’s physical condition are sparse, apart from some tidbits sprinkled across news reports, old interviews, and the countless photographs and videos taken of him over the years. Even his height has been something of a mystery, though the BBC once concluded that Xi stands roughly five feet and ten inches tall after reviewing photos of him with other world leaders.53 Xi has gained significant weight since venturing into politics and was known to be a smoker, though Chinese media say he quit while working in Fujian in the 1980s.54 As paramount leader, Xi works a high-stress job and, according to state media, once told officials that he “feels happiness in exhaustion.”55

Like many authoritarian one-party states, China lacks clear procedures for filling unplanned vacancies in top posts. The party charter merely states that the Central Committee is responsible for choosing a general secretary, who must also be a member of the Politburo Standing Committee. The Central Committee also decides the membership of the Central Military Commission, though the party charter doesn’t specify how the chairperson should be selected.56 Only the presidency is bound by a line of succession. China’s constitution states that a presidential vacancy will be filled by the vice president. Should both positions be vacant at the same time, China’s top lawmaker will fill in as acting president until the legislature appoints replacements.57 There is no requirement, whether in party regulations or state law, for the new president to also assume the roles of party chief and military commission chairman.

In the United States, the line of succession is defined by law. Under the Presidential Succession Act and the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, an incumbent president who dies, becomes incapacitated, resigns, or is removed from office would be succeeded—in order—by the vice president, the speaker of the House of Representatives, and the president pro tempore of the Senate, followed by the heads of federal executive departments. In parliamentary democracies, heads of government often designate deputy leaders who can take the helm should the prime minister be incapacitated.

But even established succession procedures can crumble in a crisis. After President Ronald Reagan was shot in 1981, Secretary of State Alexander Haig caused controversy by telling reporters that “I am in control here, in the White House”—implying that he had inherited presidential authority while Vice President George H. W. Bush was returning to Washington from Texas.58 Some White House officials prepared papers for invoking the 25th Amendment to designate Bush as acting president, but ultimately didn’t sign them.59 The robustness of American presidential transitions was tested again in the wake of the 2020 election, when President Donald Trump refused to concede defeat and tried, unsuccessfully, to challenge the integrity of the vote.

As for China, there are no clear procedures and few precedents to fall back on should Xi leave office suddenly, whether by death, illness, or resignation. In theory, the Central Committee would assemble to select a new party chief and military commission chairman, while the vice president would step up as head of state. In practice, without a designated heir in place with broad support from the party elite, the process of choosing a successor could be politically fraught.

When Vice Premier Huang Ju died of illness in 2007, party elders left his seat on the Politburo Standing Committee vacant until the party congress later that year, when the political elite were due to choose a new leadership bench. But Huang was seen as a relatively weak and inconsequential figure, and replacing him required little fuss. The potential for infighting would be much higher should a sitting leader die or become debilitated. An ideal scenario would see party grandees huddling in backroom negotiations to hash out a name most acceptable to the broader establishment, before submitting their decision for approval by the Central Committee. In most authoritarian regimes, the political elite shares a common interest in maintaining the status quo when the incumbent leader dies—for the surest way to protect their privileged status is to preserve the existing system.

In the case of incapacitation through illness or accident, the government could slip into purgatory while officials hedge between their leader’s recovery or death.60 During the five days that Stalin took to expire from his stroke in 1953, which a New Yorker writer described as dying “in installments,” members of the Soviet leadership started jockeying for advantage in the succession fight, even as they demonstrated grief and concern over the dictator’s well-being.61 Mao’s passing was even more prolonged. As his health and faculties faded in his final years, rival officials schemed against one another as they vied for Mao’s favor in hopes of becoming the chosen heir.

Should Xi die or become incapacitated, latent fissures within the senior ranks may erupt. The party elite could splinter into various factions, each backing their own preferred successor. Key constituencies, such as the military and internal security services, would likely play pivotal roles in deciding the outcome. Officials who had been sidelined by Xi may sense an opportunity to reassert their influence. “One leads China by being accepted by one’s fellow senior leaders,” says Ryan Manuel, managing director of Bilby, a Hong Kong–based artificial-intelligence firm that analyzes party governance.

A prolonged succession crisis could cripple government functions, pummel the economy, and even spark broader turmoil. In a 2016 paper analyzing authoritarian leadership changes, Andrea Kendall-Taylor and Erica Frantz found that personalist regimes, where power is highly concentrated in the hands of one individual, are “more prone to instability following a leader’s death than other, more institutionalized autocracies.” Reviewing data on nearly five hundred autocrats who left office from 1946 to 2012, they found that 22 percent of personalist regimes fell apart within a year of the leader’s death in office—the highest rate among the four types of authoritarian systems the researchers studied, including single-party, monarchic, and military dictatorships.62

Nonetheless, “authoritarian regimes have proven to be remarkably resilient when a leader dies,” Kendall-Taylor and Frantz wrote. “Even when the institutional channels for handling succession are weak, elites have a strong incentive to rally behind a new leader.”63 But their data also indicated that some 75 percent of personalist dictatorships collapsed within a year of a leadership change triggered by reasons other than death.64 If an autocrat could be forced out of office, the regime itself may be on shaky ground.





CLIQUES AND FACTIONS


ONE MORNING IN JANUARY 2016, Xi Jinping assembled the Communist Party’s top discipline inspectors to issue their marching orders for the year. These enforcers had spearheaded Xi’s efforts to combat corruption and accrue personal power, a withering campaign that unsettled many within the party and sparked backlash from some quarters. Such dissent worried Xi, who insisted that any sign of political deviance be crushed at the outset. Once the party leadership has made its decisions, Xi said, the rank and file “must not sing a different tune.”65

But intraparty discord spilled into the open just weeks later, when a prominent businessman and princeling, Ren Zhiqiang, went online to criticize Xi’s demands for fealty from Chinese media.66 When the media becomes loyal to the party and stops representing the people’s interests, “the people will be abandoned in a forgotten corner,” wrote the retired property mogul, dubbed “Cannon Ren” for his outspoken views.

Then in early March, as China’s political elite gathered in Beijing for an annual legislative session, a mysterious missive calling for Xi’s resignation appeared on the website of a state-backed news portal. Signed by “Loyal Communist Party members,” the letter criticized Xi for excessively accumulating personal power, endorsing a “personality cult,” and causing unprecedented crises for China. “For the sake of ensuring that the party’s cause can flourish, for the long-term peace and stability of the country, and for the safety of you and your family,” the letter said, “we ask you to resign from all positions of party and state leadership.”67

The party launched a withering response. Authorities shut down Ren’s social media accounts—where he had more than 37 million followers—and suspended his party membership. State media castigated Ren for being “anti-party,” a serious political allegation in China.68 Investigators hunted the authors of the anti-Xi letter, rounding up more than a dozen people affiliated with Wujie, the news portal that published it.69 Authorities in southern China took away the family of a New York–based Chinese dissident whom they suspected had helped spread the letter. The editor of an overseas Chinese website that first published the letter received harassing phone calls and death threats.70 Wujie, a media venture partly owned by the Xinjiang regional government, fell silent and soon stopped operating.

For most autocratic leaders, the fear of popular uprisings is perhaps surpassed only by their dread of an elite insurrection. “An overwhelming majority of dictators lose power to those inside the gates of the presidential palace rather than to the masses,” wrote Milan Svolik, a Yale political scientist who studies authoritarian systems. “The predominant political conflict in dictatorships appears to be not between the ruling elite and the masses but rather one among regime insiders.”71 After all, in any political system, members of the establishment are best equipped with the knowledge and resources needed to seize key levers of government and mobilize the populace.

Coups are relatively rare in communist regimes, but authoritarian leaders who are forcefully deposed don’t fare well, with 73 percent of defeated leaders facing death, jail, or exile, according to one study.72 And of the 282 Chinese emperors that Harvard’s Yuhua Wang analyzed, only about half left office by natural death. Most of the rest were murdered, overthrown, forced to abdicate or commit suicide, or deposed during civil wars, whereas external conflicts dethroned only seven emperors. “The biggest threat was from within the regime rather than from society or foreign countries,” Wang concluded.73

The specter of a palace coup is well known to Xi, whose family benefited greatly from the Gang of Four’s ouster. Xi has warned against internal plots, suggesting that some of the officials he purged had been planning to seize power. “The greater these people’s power, the more important their positions, the less seriously they took party discipline and political rules, to the point of becoming unscrupulous and audacious in the extreme,” Xi told the party’s top discipline inspectors in 2015. “Some of them had inflated political ambitions and, for their personal interests or the benefit of their clique, engaged in political plotting behind the party’s back, and carried out politically shady business to damage and split the party!”74

Some scholars describe Marxist-Leninist regimes as “leader-friendly” systems, where a sitting ruler wields significant institutional advantages over his opponents. He can call upon a formidable internal security apparatus to sniff and snuff out threats. Rivals who question his policies could expose themselves to allegations of “factionalism” and “antiparty” activities. Even when push comes to shove, most regime insiders would try to cloak their plots with a fig leaf of legitimacy and avoid tactics that could destabilize the party—such as assassination or seizing power through brute force.

Xi maintains close control over key levers of power, including internal security forces and the People’s Liberation Army. In 2020, he launched a sweeping purge of China’s law-enforcement, judicial, and domestic intelligence agencies that took down dozens of mid- to high-ranking officials, and broke up what the party denounced as a corrupt “political clique” led by a former vice minister of public security.75 Xi has also purged a number of senior generals with close ties to his predecessors, while promoting PLA officers “whose ethnic, class, and ideological backgrounds make them unlikely to back anti-regime protesters,” according to an analysis by Yale University political scientist Dan Mattingly, who reviewed more than ten thousand PLA personnel appointments.76 Blanket digital surveillance also makes it hard for would-be plotters to evade detection while they communicate with one another and solicit support from the military and security services.

Party enforcers work relentlessly to quash internal dissent. One of their most prominent targets was Ren Zhiqiang, the retired property mogul. Though he had kept a low profile since being punished for his 2016 outburst, Ren resurfaced four years later to criticize what he saw as the party’s bungled response to the Covid-19 outbreak. After he wrote an online essay in March 2020 that appeared to excoriate Xi as an imperious clown, party investigators detained Ren and accused him of political deviance and corruption.77 Ren’s pedigree as a son of a senior official, the former chairman of a state enterprise, and a friend to powerful politicians including Vice President Wang Qishan, failed to save him. The party expelled Ren for disloyalty, before a Chinese court sentenced him in September 2020 to eighteen years in jail on charges of corruption, embezzlement, and abuse of power.78

Another prominent insider, former Central Party School professor Cai Xia, was forced into exile after she criticized Xi and called the party a “political zombie” in a private talk she gave to friends in 2020.79 Cai was traveling in the U.S., unable to return to Beijing due to China’s Covid-19 travel restrictions, when an audio recording of her talk surfaced online and caused a stir within Chinese political circles. Authorities eventually expelled Cai from the party, revoked her retirement benefits, and froze her bank account. When she sought assurances from the Central Party School about her safety if she were to return home, officials dodged her questions and made vague threats against Cai’s daughter and grandchild, who were in China.80

The party also went after public intellectuals who could sway elite opinion against Xi. A top legal scholar, Xu Zhangrun, became a target after he published in summer 2018 a scathing jeremiad denouncing Xi’s autocratic turn, the first in a series of essays he wrote criticizing the Chinese leader. The following spring, Tsinghua University, where Xu was working as a law professor, suspended him, slashed his pay, and opened an investigation into his writings.81 Then in July 2020, police detained Xu for six days over allegations that he solicited prostitution, a charge often used against dissidents and one that Xu and his friends condemned as a scurrilous slur. Tsinghua sacked him soon after, citing the solicitation offense and his essays.82

China’s black-box Leninist system yields few clues about internal power dynamics. Despite frequent murmurings of high-level resentment against Xi, signs of elite struggles may not emerge until a rupture takes place. Authors of the 1986 U.S. intelligence report on Chinese succession politics, for instance, didn’t anticipate that Deng would depose his own protégé, Hu Yaobang, as general secretary less than a year later.83 Even within the party, a lack of reliable intelligence can cause grief for insiders trying to arrange a plot, or an incumbent leader trying to forestall one.

Xi, for his part, has taken few chances in protecting his power. Similar to Mao and Deng, he has sought to dismantle alternative power centers, intimidate potential rivals, and undermine even close colleagues who didn’t appear to pose serious threats or have ambitions of challenging the leader. He has used party disciplinary probes against his perceived opponents, sometimes directly, but often simply to undercut them by tearing down their political networks. Those targeted with the subtler approach included former security chief Meng Jianzhu, who saw some of his protégés, including two vice ministers of public security, purged for corruption after he stepped down from the Politburo in 2017. Chen Yuan, a former top banker and an influential son of the revolutionary hero Chen Yun, saw party inspectors open investigations against his wife and more than a dozen of his associates.84

Even Wang Qishan, one of Xi’s oldest friends, wasn’t beyond reach. People close to Wang say he has no ambitions to be leader. He is five years older than Xi and considered too old to be a viable successor. But he still commanded considerable clout of his own, and therefore posed a latent threat.

Wang had stepped down from the party leadership in late 2017, after five years as Xi’s anticorruption czar, and in the following spring became vice president, a ceremonial sinecure seen as a reward conferred by Xi. In 2020, the anti-graft enforcers that Wang once led started going after people inside his political and personal circles. The party purged Wang’s friend Ren Zhiqiang and opened a corruption probe against one of Wang’s longtime aides, Dong Hong—a case that resulted in Dong receiving a de facto life sentence. Officials investigating the bankrupt Chinese conglomerate HNA Group detained its chairman, a friend of Wang’s, in the fall of 2021. Wang’s nephew-in-law, Yao Qing, was taken into custody the following spring and held for several months as authorities examined the alleged ties that Yao, the grandson of a revolutionary elder, had with HNA. Citing corruption charges, the party then purged a veteran banker who had once worked under Wang.85

If elite conflict does break out, the battle lines will likely be messy and personality-driven, with rivals settling scores rather than arguing over ideological and policy differences, according to Joseph Torigian, the historian, who wrote a book analyzing Soviet and Chinese succession struggles that followed the deaths of Stalin and Mao. Elite struggles in Marxist-Leninist regimes are something of a “knife fight with weird rules,” where contenders battle yet still seek a veneer of legitimacy and avoid wanton violence that could undermine the ruling party, Torigian says.86

The succession fights after Stalin and Mao upended politics in both countries, where the winners repudiated despotism and built new power structures that they hoped wouldn’t succumb to one-man rule. Neither Stalin nor Mao, for all their might, could ensure their systems of governance outlived them. The biggest threat to an autocrat’s legacy may well be himself.





APRÈS MOI


WHEN THE CHINESE EDUCATOR and political activist Huang Yanpei toured the Communist Party’s Yan’an revolutionary base in July 1945, Mao Zedong invited his esteemed visitor into a cave dwelling and probed his thoughts on the future of their war-torn nation. While Huang was impressed by the Communists’ collective spirit, he expressed profound pessimism about the party’s ability to chart a new course for China.

Huang confided that he could see no escape from the historical cycles that have persisted for millennia, the rise and fall of dynasties that seem as inexorable as the changing of seasons. Time and again, China suffered spells of slack and hubristic rule, as well as instances where a leader’s system of governance crumbled after his death, Huang said. “No one has been able to leap out of this cycle.”87

Mao dismissed Huang’s fears. “We have found a new path; we can leap out of this cycle,” he replied. “This path is called democracy. Only by letting the people supervise the government, then the government wouldn’t dare slacken.” And if everyone did their duty, Mao said, there would be no danger of “the leader dies, and his governance ends.”88

But Mao and his successors didn’t bring democracy to China, at least not in the Western liberal sense. The party imposed iron-fisted control and became a vehicle for the “rule of man,” whereby the leader exercises preponderant power—shaping, bending, and breaking norms as he sees fit. Xi embraced this autocratic tradition when he took power, but also gave it his own spin. Where Mao ruled through charisma and used the party as an expendable tool of revolution, Xi governs through the party, calling it an indispensable instrument of governance.

It is in this context that Xi invokes the Huang-Mao dialogue, often citing it as a warning against complacency and decay that could topple the Communist Party.89 “Looking back on histories of the rise and fall of feudal dynasties, it isn’t difficult to see,” he said, how past Chinese regimes repeatedly collapsed under the weight of corruption, hedonism, and weak governance. As long as the party steels itself with a sense of collective purpose and ideological zeal, Xi told officials, “we would be able to leap out of the historical cycles of ‘rapid rise and rapid fall.’ ”90

A decade into the Xi era, the party appears more in control than ever. It embraces digital authoritarianism and maintains a high-tech security state. It coerces and surveils citizens with internet controls, big data, facial recognition, social-credit systems, and other state-of-the-art tools. Civil society has been all but neutered; activists get imprisoned, muzzled, forced into exile, or coopted by the state. Dissenting voices face police harassment, jail time, and a ravenous online “cancel culture” fueled by party-backed patriotism. The People’s Liberation Army increasingly flexes its abilities to wage war and project power. Chinese diplomats charge forth with a more aggressive approach to foreign policy. And above it all, Xi stands supreme, as the face of China’s cutting-edge autocracy.

The secret to this success, Xi says, is continuous “self-revolution.”91 He insists the party can escape the dynastic cycles of rise and fall by waging a ceaseless struggle—against its inner demons of greed and indolence, and the outer enemies of Western subversion. He argues that this “self-revolution” can be institutionalized, whereby the party operates by rules and norms, rather than the whims of an individual leader. This means codifying exemplary conduct and enforcing it with a Praetorian Guard of discipline inspectors, whose constant vigilance shall keep the party potent and pure. Through self-revolution, Xi declared, days before taking his third term as general secretary, “we have ensured that the party will never change in nature, change in color, or change in flavor.”92

Yet Xi’s system remains reliant on his personal initiative, as it has been for arguably most Chinese rulers since antiquity. Xi implements major initiatives through top-down campaigns. He takes personal charge over issues he cares about and intervenes often, penning vague instructions that bureaucrats sometimes struggle to decipher. Officials rush to comply, driven less by passion and more by fear. Few dare question Xi’s edicts, however confusing or contradictory, sometimes producing policies that seem poorly designed and must be reversed later. If the mark of institutionalized governance is more predictability, Xi appears to have achieved the opposite. “The CCP cannot be institutionalized without destroying what makes it a Leninist party—a hierarchical, mobilizational, task-oriented party,” writes Joseph Fewsmith, the Boston University political scientist. What Xi has done, Fewsmith argues, is “to put the Lenin back in the Leninist party.”93

The risk is that the party of Xi may be so driven by his personality that few of his potential successors—least of all a weak one—could command it effectively in his absence. That’s not to say that the party can’t survive without Xi. China’s Communist rulers have time and again defied prophecies of doom, surviving crises and adapting to new circumstances. A system that appears dysfunctional and wasteful can still operate well enough to keep things going for a long time. But that wouldn’t be good enough for Xi’s lofty standards.

Xi promised to build a system that could transcend China’s feudal past, restore its glories, and seal his place among history’s greatest statesmen. But his new-look Communist Party has come to resemble, in some ways, the imperial bureaucracies of old—bigger and better organized, but no less autocratic, rigid, and plagued by succession woes. Just as leaders have died and their governance ended throughout Chinese antiquity, Xi may have become a single point of failure in his China Dream. Whether the party of Xi can hold together without its linchpin leader is perhaps a question only time can answer.
