title: 3 Law Is Order—The Party Writes the Rules
---




“No country is permanently strong or permanently weak. If those who uphold the law are strong, the country will be strong; if they are weak, the country will be weak.”

—Han Fei, Chinese philosopher from the third century B.C.


“The problem now is that our laws are incomplete, with a lot of legislation yet to be enacted. Very often, what leaders say is taken as the law, and any disagreement is deemed as law-breaking.”

—Deng Xiaoping


“The question of ‘whether the party or the law is more important’ is a political trap and a pseudo-proposition.… Party leadership and law-based governance aren’t opposed to each other, but are in unity.”

—Xi Jinping



First her lights went out. Then her internet connection died. Wang Yu could hear someone trying to force open her front door, but when she looked through the peephole, she saw nothing. It was around 3 a.m., just hours after she had bidden goodbye to her husband and teenage son as they left to catch a red-eye flight to Australia, where the boy would attend high school. They were supposed to call her after clearing immigration, but her phone hadn’t rung and she couldn’t reach them. Now someone was trying to break into her apartment, and she was all alone.1

Wang sent a message to her friends. Someone suggested she get a nearby friend to come over. Another asked if her door lock was sturdy. Her husband had just changed it, she replied, because he worried about her safety when she was alone at home. As a human rights lawyer, Wang had often been hauled in by police trying to intimidate her into stopping her legal activism. Perhaps this was another attempt. Wang went up to the door and asked, “Who is it?” The sound stopped. Whoever was outside seemed to have left, Wang told her friends.

A loud noise, like an electric drill, rang through the apartment at around 4 a.m. Wang leapt out of bed and tried calling people. But before she could reach someone, a man broke through her door, his headlamp shining on her face. “Don’t move! We’re from the Beijing Public Security Bureau,” he said. “Who are you?” Wang demanded. “What gives you the right to barge in here? Show me your identification.” More people rushed in, shoving her onto her bed, cuffing her hands behind her back, and pulling a black hood over her head. They threw Wang into a van, ignoring her teary pleas for her handcuffs to be loosened.2 Her husband, a rights activist, and their son didn’t make it to Australia. They were detained before they could board the plane.

Wang didn’t know it yet, but she was far from alone in her plight. Many friends and fellow lawyers who raised the alarm about her disappearance that summer morning in 2015 soon vanished. Wang’s boss was detained too, as were several of her colleagues at the Fengrui Law Firm, a Beijing outfit known for representing defendants in politically delicate cases. Authorities ultimately rounded up and interrogated more than three hundred lawyers and activists in a nationwide sweep known as the “709 crackdown,” so named after the date it started, July 9. Many of those detained were part of China’s weiquan, or “rights defense,” movement—a loose collective of legal professionals and intellectuals who sought to protect civil rights through litigation and public advocacy, and help clients seek redress for abuses by the state.3

Rights defense advocates numbered just in the hundreds, a tiny fraction of the more than 270,000 licensed lawyers in China at the time. But they were an impassioned lot, taking on politically charged cases involving government abuses and negligence—from illegal land grabs and police brutality to food safety scandals and religious persecution. The most zealous ones called themselves “die-hard” lawyers, known for their combative tactics and dramatic gestures aimed at whipping up public pressure against the government. Their pugnacity had long annoyed the authorities, who condemned these lawyers as provocateurs and sometimes detained them.4 Even so, there was a tacit acceptance within some corners of the party that such activism, while irksome, helped keep local officials in check.

For decades, Chinese leaders have pledged to build robust legal institutions that can deliver good governance and social stability. In theory, this goal meant the party-state would enact laws to prescribe social norms, regulate economic activity, and provide peaceful means for citizens to resolve disputes, while devolving day-to-day enforcement to dedicated professionals—judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and police officers. But as China’s economy took off, its fledgling legal system struggled to keep up with the social distensions kicked up by widening wealth gaps and the spread of corruption.

Rights defense lawyers emerged amid this ferment, providing an outlet for aggrieved citizens trying to right government wrongs. Wang herself, a former commercial attorney, turned against the system after suffering what she describes as a miscarriage of justice. Her epiphany came after an altercation with train station employees in 2008, when she was stopped from boarding despite having a ticket and got beaten up for her troubles. She filed a complaint against police officers whom she blamed for failing to intercede, only to be slapped with assault charges that landed her in jail for two and a half years.

“It was a great awakening for me to the arrogance of state power,” recalls Wang, who left prison in 2011 determined to fight back. She reinvented herself as a rights advocate, taking on sensitive cases and defending clients that few others dared to represent, including Uyghur academic Ilham Tohti, who received a life sentence in 2014 on separatism charges, and members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement.5 Though mild-mannered among friends, Wang proved to be a fiery presence in court, sometimes lashing out against judges and prosecutors who she believed had violated her clients’ rights.

Rights defense advocates like Wang wanted to pressure authorities into applying the law in ways that restrained the party. And win or lose, they were having an effect. Their work stirred public debate on civil rights and prodded the government into adopting some reforms, such as abolishing in 2013 a controversial “re-education through labor” program that allowed police to send people into gulag-like camps without trial. For liberal-minded Chinese, the rights defense movement showed how civil society can improve governance and spur social change. Xi Jinping and his supporters sensed an attempt to usurp the party’s authority.

A month before Wang’s detention, state media published a scathing commentary denouncing her as an “arrogant woman with a criminal record” who gabbled hypocritically about human rights while masquerading as a lawyer. The vitriol intensified after the 709 crackdown began, seeking to discredit the rights defense movement as a whole.6 News reports portrayed Wang and her colleagues as hooligans and con artists who hyped up cases to chase fame and remuneration. A commentary in the People’s Daily denounced rights lawyers as the “black hands” behind efforts to “pollute” the internet and disturb public order.

Authorities brought criminal charges against more than two dozen people. Wang and several other Fengrui staffers were accused of “inciting subversion of state power,” an offense punishable with lengthy prison terms. In August 2016, more than a year after she was nabbed, Wang resurfaced in an online video where she admitted to wrongdoing and disavowed her legal work—remarks she later said she was forced to make.7 Wang and her husband were released soon after, but remained under state scrutiny that made it hard for them to resume their activism.8 Some of Wang’s colleagues were less fortunate. One received an eight-year jail term. Her boss, sentenced to seven years, used his closing statement in court to declare that “Xi Jinping’s rule of law has made China ever stronger.”9

It was a stunning denouement for a spirited community of legal activists who had believed they could nudge China closer toward its constitutional ideals, and perhaps even something akin to Western-style rule of law that constrains the arbitrary use of state power. Fearing further reprisals, many rights lawyers went underground, abandoned their work, or fled abroad. “The rule of law in China has reached a nadir,” Wang says. “I’m not just pessimistic, I’m in despair.”10

The crackdown killed off any lingering hope among politically minded Chinese that Xi was a closet liberal, biding his time before loosening the party’s authoritarian grip. In the fall of 2014, less than a year before mass arrests, Xi had pledged to strengthen the legal system and improve judicial fairness to ensure that the party could effectively govern an increasingly complex and contentious society. Since then, his administration has directed what experts describe as China’s most relentless pursuit of dissenters since the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests. Authorities detained, intimidated, or jailed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people—rights lawyers, labor organizers, women’s rights advocates, religious devotees, independent researchers, citizen journalists, and other civil-society figures who tried to operate outside of party oversight.

Many faced lengthy detentions with no access to legal counsel. Some, like Wang, were coerced into making televised confessions, smeared by state media, and denied fair trials. They had no recourse against these abuses, nor could they expect any. Former U.S. president Richard Nixon, in defending his abuses of power, once insisted that “when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” In China, it is the Communist Party that exercises this prerogative, insisting that the law is a lever of state power, not a restraint. The party can play judge, jury, or even executioner.

Many legal scholars argue that China practices “rule by law,” whereby the powers that be use legislation as tools of control and impose few constraints on their own authority, as opposed to the “rule of law,” where the rulers and the ruled are both treated equally under the same legal standards. In Chinese, both concepts can be expressed as fazhi, and official translations typically refer to the “rule of law.” Semantics aside, many Western observers have condemned what they see as judicial regression under Xi. In 2021, the Washington-based advocacy group World Justice Report ranked China 98th out of 139 nations on a global rule-of-law index, down from 76th among 99 countries in 2014.11

Even so, some experts argue that measuring China’s legal reforms by Western standards, while useful in some ways, misapprehends the party’s views on the law. Chinese agencies commonly seen as judicial institutions aren’t meant to engage in legal activity, but are instead driven by the political goal of maintaining social order, according to Donald Clarke, a George Washington University professor who studies the Chinese legal system. What China has been building since the end of the Mao era, Clarke wrote, is “a system for the maintenance of order and the political primacy of the Chinese Communist Party, not for the delivery of justice.”12

Chinese courts, prosecutorial agencies, and police forces don’t act independently, nor do they provide meaningful checks on one another’s powers. Rather, they operate in concert as part of a vast coercive apparatus known as the zhengfa xitong, or “political-legal system,” named after the party’s top body overseeing internal security, the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, or zhengfawei for short. Collectively controlling yearly budgets that surpass China’s declared military spending, they are known in party parlance as the “knife handle”—a Mao-era epithet that kindles images of menacing marauders dealing rough justice.13 As the name suggests, the political-legal system is guided primarily by politics, and in this regard, there is no greater priority than securing the party’s power.

Xi describes the “knife handle” as an indispensable guarantor of Communist rule, on par with the propaganda “pen shaft” and the military “gun barrel.” He directed far-reaching purges to tighten his grip on the blade and spared no expense in sharpening its edges, doubling China’s annual spending on public security to some $217 billion by 2020. He tapped private-sector expertise and leading-edge technology to bolster the party’s formidable surveillance networks, marrying new big-data and artificial intelligence tools with Mao-era tactics to screen suspects, silence dissent, and suppress unrest.

Xi’s efforts have yielded a nonpareil system of social control. It features “predictive policing” systems that uses data from social media, online shopping platforms, and facial recognition cameras to assess possible threats. It champions the development of a nascent “social credit” system that tracks people’s behavior—both in the real world and online—and tries to influence conduct with carrots and sticks.14 It promotes the use of mobile apps cajoling citizens to gripe about local grievances and snitch on one another.15 It relies on police forces bolstered with more personnel and better equipment, including drones and forensic devices for extracting data from laptops and smartphones. It transformed regions with large populations of ethnic minorities, including Xinjiang and Tibet, into test beds for new surveillance and coercion techniques, portending what critics describe as China’s dystopian future of “techno-totalitarianism.”16

Not since the Mao era has the party exerted such dominance over Chinese society. And it was that era that seeded the impulses driving Xi’s quest for control, amid the chaos unleashed by China’s last totalitarian ruler.





ORDER FROM CHAOS


DURING MAO ZEDONG’S LAST INTERVIEW with American journalist Edgar Snow in December 1970, some four years into the Cultural Revolution, the chairman scoffed at the hero worship that had enveloped him. The personality cult was overdone, Mao said, and the four reverential titles he had been given—Great Teacher, Great Leader, Great Supreme Commander, and Great Helmsman—were a nuisance that would eventually be eliminated. But he would still be known as a teacher, because “Mao had always been a schoolteacher and still was one,” Snow later wrote of their conversation, conducted over five hours within the cloistered confines of Mao’s study. “As he courteously escorted me to the door, he said he was not a complicated man, but really very simple,” Snow recalled. “He was, he said, a lone monk walking the world with a leaky umbrella.”17

This Mao quotation gained considerable cachet in the Western imagination after Snow’s account of their dialogue appeared in Life magazine. But some observers, dismayed with Snow’s partiality toward Mao, said the journalist failed to recognize the cynical immodesty embedded in the chairman’s words. “Snow’s command of the Chinese language, even at its best, was never very fluent,” wrote Pierre Ryckmans, the Belgian-Australian sinologist better known by his pen name Simon Leys.18 “It is no wonder that he failed to recognize in this ‘monk under an umbrella’ evoked by the Chairman, a most popular Chinese joke.” Ryckmans explained that the expression Mao used, heshang dasan, or “a monk opens an umbrella,” forms a riddle typically answered with another four-syllable phrase, wufa wutian, or “no hair, no sky,” conjuring the image of a bald ascetic sheltering from the elements. The real punchline lies in homophony. Wufa wutian can also mean “I know no law, I hold nothing sacred.”

For many Chinese who lived through his reign, Mao was the law. His despotic “rule of man” was often a recipe for chaos, unleashing bloody purges and mob justice against class enemies on a grand scale. In the latter half of the 1950s, Mao appealed for constructive criticism of the party—expressed through an ancient verse, “let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend”—only to reverse course after receiving vituperative attacks on his government’s deficiencies. He directed an “anti-rightist” purge that persecuted more than a million people for allegedly trying to restore capitalism, including legal specialists who denounced officials for flouting the law and meddling in judicial processes. Some Chinese scholars alleged that Mao had even suggested that “rule of man” was better than the rule of law, saying, “an editorial in the People’s Daily gets implemented across the country, why is there a need for any laws?”19

Mao’s megalomania reached a bloody zenith in the summer of 1966, when he launched the Cultural Revolution to reclaim his authority from party grandees who tried to sideline him, and rip up a party bureaucracy that he believed had strayed from its revolutionary roots. Fanatical youth became violent vigilantes known as Red Guards, who tormented “counter-revolutionary” elements with verbal and physical attacks. A People’s Daily editorial, “In Praise of Lawlessness,” urged Mao’s supporters to destroy “bourgeois law” that repressed the people.20 Accusations often amounted to convictions. Children denounced parents, students accused teachers, friends turned on each other. Some of Mao’s closest comrades were jailed, tortured, and in some cases, left to die. Millions lost their lives amid a frenzied bloodletting that teetered close to civil war.

The carnage had petered out by the time Mao died, but the specter of chaos still loomed. To prevent a repeat of such mayhem, Deng Xiaoping restored key levers of state power—including law enforcement and the judiciary—and urged political reforms to foster the stable governance that China needed to modernize its economy. “The problem now is that our laws are incomplete, with a lot of legislation yet to be enacted. Very often, what leaders say is taken as the law, and any disagreement is deemed as law-breaking,” Deng said. The party must establish a sound legal system, he argued, “to make sure that institutions and laws do not change whenever the leadership changes, or whenever leaders change their views or shift their attention.”21

Under Deng, the party reestablished the justice ministry, rebuilt courts and procuratorates, reopened law schools closed under Mao, and rehabilitated purged legal specialists into academia and professional practice. Authorities enacted new criminal, civil, and commercial legislation, and launched propaganda campaigns to cultivate public awareness of the law.22 China adopted a new constitution in 1982, articulating fundamental principles for citizens’ rights, including equality before the law and access to open trials.

Officials pressed for political reforms known as dangzheng fenkai, or “separating the party and the government,” aimed at extricating the party from day-to-day governance and limiting its powers to key areas such as policy formulation and personnel appointments. When drafting the 1982 constitution, officials removed references to the party from the document’s main text (while keeping them in the preamble), a symbolic change to connote clearer distinctions between party and state. The goal was to create a more professional civil service less fettered by party politicking. Some liberal-minded reformers even hoped that state institutions would grow strong enough to constrain the party’s powers.

But Deng never intended to adopt Western-style rule of law, where the governing and the governed are all held accountable to the same legal standards administered by independent courts. Unlike in many liberal democracies, China’s constitution is a largely hollow document—most of its provisions take legal effect only after legislators enact specific laws to implement them. Courts operate under party control and have no power to review laws for their constitutionality. As Deng told a visiting Yugoslav leader in 1987, China’s political reforms “can neither borrow from the West’s so-called democracy nor copy their three-way separation of powers.” And most importantly, he said, they “cannot do without the leadership of the Communist Party.”23

Such instincts intensified after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, a near-death experience for the party that fueled its obsession with weiwen, or “stability maintenance,” a shorthand for suppressing unrest and other threats to Communist rule. Deng responded by purging liberal reformers and halting further “separation of party and government.” He persisted with legal reforms, but stressed that the law shouldn’t shackle the party.

Deng’s successors followed his lead, introducing the doctrine of yifa zhiguo, or “governing the nation in accordance with the law,” suggesting the party would develop legal institutions as tools of authoritarian control. Both Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao enacted new statutes to fill gaps in legislation, built up the private legal sector, and mobilized the criminal justice system to quash dissent. After Jiang ordered the party to crush the Falun Gong spiritual movement in 1999, police and judicial authorities played a leading role in the crackdown—rounding up Falun Gong practitioners, pressuring their lawyers against entering not guilty pleas, and directing courts to do their “political duty” by meting out severe punishment.24

Hu ramped up the use of judicial organs for repression as rapid economic growth kicked up social unrest. Promising to create a “harmonious society,” he ordered officials to maintain stability by any means necessary, spurring the rise of “securocrats” who proved their worth by keeping the peace while delivering growth.25 Hu named a former police official as chief justice and promoted a judicial doctrine known as the “three supremes”—judges and prosecutors must uphold “the supremacy of the party’s cause, the supremacy of the people’s interests, and supremacy of the constitution and laws,” in that order.26 His administration encouraged courts to resolve civil disputes through mediation rather than litigation, a shift that some scholars say “pressured courts to function less as enforcers of the law and more as managers of personal ties and conflicts.”27

Rather than the “rule of law,” the party came to operate by what the late political scientist Mayling Birney called the “rule of mandates,” whereby front-line cadres were largely free to bend, ignore, or even break the law as they pursued directives—or “mandates”—assigned by their superiors. “Local officials must pursue high priority political targets but have immense discretion over which laws to implement,” Birney wrote. “The implementation of laws is thus conditional on their compatibility with higher priority mandates.”28

By the time Xi took power, China’s legal system had become widely resented for corruption and lack of professionalism, a problem exacerbated by heavy workloads and poor pay in the judiciary that spurred a brain drain to the private legal sector.29 Public distrust of the courts undermined the party’s legitimacy, as ordinary Chinese became more insistent that their government should follow the law and protect citizens’ rights.30 Xi responded with judicial overhauls to restore public faith and mitigate a rise in social ferment.31 If the judiciary lacks credibility, Xi said, “social justice will be widely questioned, and social harmony and stability will be difficult to guarantee.”32

Xi’s legal reforms took shape in the fall of 2014, when the party’s Central Committee convened its first-ever plenary session on the “rule of law” and unveiled broad overhauls for the judicial system.33 They included the creation of “circuit courts,” which would ease workloads on the top court in Beijing, and other measures to curb local government interference in court decisions.34 Authorities pledged to impose lifetime liability on judges who mishandled cases, and prevent the use of torture and other illegal means to secure evidence and confessions. The party strengthened disciplinary supervision over the judiciary, while boosting pay for judges and prosecutors to help retain talent. China’s chief justice apologized for a spate of wrongful convictions, while authorities retried some high-profile capital cases and exonerated defendants.35

When discussing legal reforms, Xi often invokes Confucian ideas of moral rectitude and benevolent governance by wise and virtuous noblemen, rooting his vision of “law-based governance” in traditional Chinese culture. In practice, Xi hews more closely to another ancient school of thought known as Legalism, or fajia in Chinese, whose proponents advocate harsh autocratic rule as a way to impose order.

Legalism dates back to the Warring States period more than 2,200 years ago, before Qin Shi Huang unified China. Whereas Confucianists see inherent goodness in human nature, Legalists believe that people are covetous and driven by self-interest—qualities that threaten social order. A ruler should therefore harness his subjects’ intrinsic selfishness to maintain control, dispensing rewards and punishments to keep his officials and ordinary people in line. Only a strong state buttressed by strict laws and heavy penalties, Legalists argue, can avert chaos.36

Xi has shown fondness for Legalist thought since taking power. He spoke admiringly of Shang Yang, an ancient scholar and statesman whose ideas on autocratic rule and draconian justice helped turn a feeble Qin state into a powerful kingdom that established China’s first imperial dynasty. In 2014, Xi marked the Chinese legislature’s sixtieth anniversary with a telling quote from Han Fei, arguably the most famous Legalist thinker. “If those who uphold the law are strong, the country will be strong,” he said. “If they are weak, the country will be weak.”37

Guided by such advice, Xi became China’s codifier-in-chief, enacting new laws at an unprecedented pace and enforcing them rigorously. During Xi’s first decade in power, the National People’s Congress passed on average close to double the number of bills per year than it had done during Hu’s second term, according to data collated by Changhao Wei, a fellow at Yale Law School and the founder of NPC Observer, a website tracking Chinese lawmaking activities.38 Some statutes set the contours of Xi’s authoritarian rule, outlawing threats to China’s one-party government and territorial unity, as well as economic, social, and cyberspace interests.39 Others fortified government powers for policing dissent, regulating commercial activity, and protecting the environment. China also clarified the boundaries of acceptable behavior for all citizens by stitching together its first unified code of civil law, which defines personal and property rights over matters including contracts and marriage.40

In keeping with his Legalist leanings, Xi demanded iron-fisted enforcement. His administration brought the full weight of the criminal justice system to bear against civil society, prosecuting activists, shutting down nonprofits, and effectively criminalizing many forms of advocacy work that fell outside party supervision.41 A new law regulating foreign NGOs, passed in 2016, prompted many groups to scale back their activities in China or pull out entirely.42 Authorities silenced scholars who called for legal restraints on the state’s arbitrary use of power, while amplifying voices that rejected Western-style rule of law. Some Chinese intellectuals, for instance, found favor by championing the ideas of German legal theorist Carl Schmitt, who earned infamy as the “crown jurist of the Third Reich” by supplying the Nazis with arguments for unfettered executive power.43

Xi’s reforms appeared to pay some dividends. Authorities reported a surge in administrative lawsuits filed by citizens against the government, suggesting that ordinary Chinese were putting more faith in the legal system by spending time and money pursuing claims against the state. Under Xi, the annual total of administrative cases adjudicated in court doubled to nearly 270,000 in 2020, while the volume of administrative litigation reached a record 20 cases per 100,000 people in 2019—far higher than the Hu-era annual average of about 8 cases per 100,000.44 Plaintiffs’ win rates in such lawsuits, which dipped from roughly 30 percent to less than 10 percent under Hu, had recovered to nearly 15 percent by 2016, suggesting that Xi’s reforms helped reduce judicial interference.45 But progress has proved more elusive in the criminal justice system, where corruption and impunity were deeply rooted. For Xi, cleaning up China’s contingents of police officers, prosecutors, and judges isn’t just a matter of good governance, but also a question of political survival.





GRASPING THE KNIFE HANDLE


MOMENTS BEFORE MENG HONGWEI, one of China’s top cops, disappeared during a work trip to Beijing, he sent a cryptic text to his wife: “wait for my call.” He had arrived that day in September 2018 for what was meant to be a routine sojourn—the vice minister of public security often shuttled between the Chinese capital and the French city of Lyon, where he was serving as president of the global police agency Interpol.46 What followed instead was a flurry of international intrigue that drew global attention to how the Communist Party acts less than scrupulously with due process and the rule of law.

Meng never called his wife. Four minutes later, he sent her an ominous signal: an emoji of a knife. She tried ringing her husband but no one answered. One of the world’s most senior police officers had vanished.47

At first, Meng’s wife waited to see if he might re-emerge. But as days passed and a threatening phone call came in warning that people were coming to Lyon to get her, she called the cops. News of Meng’s disappearance flashed across international media, while Interpol officials scrambled to ascertain their president’s fate. Only then did Beijing start breaking its silence, sending Interpol a letter purportedly written by Meng, saying that he was resigning voluntarily.48 Shortly after, China’s top anticorruption agency announced that Meng was being investigated for violating the law.49

The unusual drama around Meng’s downfall belied the almost routine quality that China’s purges of senior security officials had taken on under Xi Jinping, who has weeded out scores of high-ranking police officers, prosecutors, judges, and spies, all the while tightening his control over crucial levers of coercive power. By his reckoning, years of moral decay and decentralization had allowed the party’s law enforcers to stray from their core mission of maintaining order and upholding Communist rule. “We must cultivate zhengfa forces that are loyal to the party, the nation, the people, and the law,” Xi said. “And ensure that the knife handle is firmly in the hands of the party and the people.”50

Under Hu Jintao, Beijing delegated significant autonomy to lower-level authorities in the suppression of civil unrest, allowing local security officials to acquire substantive powers and financial resources that became ripe for abuses such as graft and collusion with organized crime. Zhou Yongkang, who was public security minister and then secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission, or zhengfawei, under Hu, allegedly built personal cliques within the security forces and used his clout to wage factional fights within the party. Bolstered by bulging budgets, the zhengfa system swelled into what some critics called “a state within a state”—a rival power center that Xi couldn’t tolerate.

Xi asserted control as party chief. He downgraded the role of zhengfawei secretary from the Politburo Standing Committee to the broader Politburo. Xi created a new National Security Commission and named himself chairman, assuming personal authority over China’s security forces and overhauling their command structures to tackle long-standing problems of interagency rivalry and poor coordination.51 He purged the zhengfa ranks, discarding the corrupt and disloyal while installing allies in key security posts.52 Xi directed a nationwide crackdown on organized crime, targeting “underworld groups” and corrupt officials—particularly in police and judicial agencies—who colluded with them.53 Out went Hu’s sloganeering for a “harmonious society,” replaced by Xi’s calls for “building a peaceful China.”54

In the early years, Xi’s zhengfa clean-out appeared to focus on high-ranking “tigers.” It took down regional security chiefs, senior prosecutors, a vice president of the Supreme People’s Court, as well as deputy ministers at the ministries of public security and state security, the latter being China’s top civilian intelligence service.55 The biggest tiger-slaying came in July 2014, when party inspectors opened a case against Zhou Yongkang for corruption and abuse of power, precipitating a broader hunt for those who enjoyed his patronage while he ran the internal security apparatus.56

Meng, the Interpol president, was among them. A veteran police officer, he became vice minister of public security in 2004 and held various portfolios over the years, including stints as coast guard chief and director of China’s Interpol branch. Meng won election as Interpol president in 2016 thanks to intense lobbying by Beijing, which hoped to leverage the largely ceremonial post for greater influence over the issuance of “red notices”—formal requests for police forces around the world to detain designated fugitives. Rights activists have accused China of using red notices to hunt dissidents, though Beijing insists it only seeks felons accused of serious crimes like corruption and terrorism. Meng sought more control over Interpol’s operations but couldn’t deliver the red notices that China wanted. Tensions with his superiors rose to the point that he was making arrangements to live abroad after his four-year tenure was over—a risky plan that likely made him a target.57

The party expelled Meng, accusing him of showing political disloyalty, defying party decisions, taking bribes, abusing his powers to get his wife cushy finance-sector jobs, and spending state funds to satisfy his family’s “luxurious lifestyle.”58 The public security ministry characterized Meng’s case as part of broader efforts to eradicate “Zhou Yongkang’s pernicious influence.”59 Meng later confessed in court and was sentenced to thirteen and a half years in jail.60

For many party insiders, the Meng case underscored how corruption had pervaded China’s security forces, and the immensity of Xi’s task in trying to clean it up. Xi’s solution was to demand more loyalty, under the threat of punishment. The party issued new internal regulations in 2019 aimed at centralizing control over law-enforcement and judicial agencies, and calling on all zhengfa cadres “to resolutely safeguard General Secretary Xi Jinping’s core position in the party center.”61 The purges rumbled on. Another vice minister of public security, Sun Lijun, was cashiered in April 2020 and later denounced for wide-ranging misconduct that included corruption, damaging the party’s unity, and leading a “political clique” of senior law-enforcement officials that indulged in graft and abused power.62 The police chief in Chongqing went down in June that year, and was eventually jailed for corruption.63

In the summer of 2020, Xi launched his most systematic cleanup of the zhengfa apparatus to date. The nationwide “rectification” subjected all members of the police, judicial, and security services to months of disciplinary scrutiny and ideological training.64 Xi entrusted the effort to a loyalist, Chen Yixin, then secretary-general at the zhengfawei, who had earned a reputation for taking on politically fraught assignments, from busting organized crime to marshaling epidemic controls in the city where Covid-19 first emerged.65 Chen kicked off the purge with a high-profile speech, calling on the zhengfa system to “turn the blade inwards and scrape the poison off the bone.” Urging officials to emulate the 1942–45 Yan’an rectification movement, a purge that consolidated Mao’s control over the party, Chen declared that Xi’s latter-day cleansing would produce judges, prosecutors, and police officers who were “absolutely loyal, absolutely pure and absolutely reliable.”66

Within the first week, party inspectors opened cases against at least twenty-one domestic security and judicial officials. Dozens more would go down, including senior figures later identified as members of Sun Lijun’s “political clique”—a former justice minister, a provincial security czar, regional police chiefs, and a top discipline inspector at the Ministry of State Security.67 The public security ministry revised the oath of honor for police officers, dropping a pledge to “promote social fairness and justice” and adding commitments to “defend political security” and “firmly uphold the absolute leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.”68 Ending what some insiders saw as a quasi-amnesty for errant officials who showed restraint after Xi took power, law-enforcement agencies ordered retrospective reviews of old cases—including organized-crime probes, commuted jail sentences, and parole decisions—going as far back as thirty years, so as to uncover past misconduct by police, prosecutors, judges, and prison officials.69

Xi’s purges at times cast an uneasy spotlight on local corruption and judicial misconduct. State media credited his crackdown on organized crime—known as saohei chu’e, or “sweep black and eliminate evil”—for breaking up collusion between officials and mobsters, and anecdotal evidence suggests the campaign has been popular among ordinary Chinese angered by the impunity of local crime rings. But some high-profile scandals also exposed the depth of impunity within local security forces, where some officials have run roughshod over legal procedures to meet quotas for arrests and convictions, or even engaged in organized crime themselves.

Such practices burst into view in the northern industrial city of Baotou, where, amid allegations of police and prosecutorial misconduct, an organized-crime trial collapsed in 2020 and became a cause célèbre for judicial reform. The case centered on Wang Yongming, a moneylender and Baotou native accused of leading an “underworld group” that engaged in loan-sharking, extortion, and blackmail.70 His daughter, Wang Ran, claimed a local policeman running his own money-lending business framed her father. According to her version of events, the local cop started feuding with her father after one debtor borrowed from both men but only repaid the debts owed to the elder Wang. The policeman then tried to extort money from Wang, before opening a criminal investigation against him as payback.71

Lawyers representing Wang and his alleged accomplices accused Baotou authorities of prejudging the outcome at a pretrial meeting, where police, prosecutors, and court officials—according to an account from the local procuratorate—reached agreement on how to manage certain aspects of the case, including its classification as organized crime and the handling of the alleged gang’s “illegal gains.” The defense also accused Baotou police of accepting fabricated evidence from one of Wang’s debtors and wrongfully denying bail to the moneylender, who lawyers believe should have qualified for medical bail on account of his recent leg amputation and kidney transplant.72

Irregularities marked the trial from the start. The court restricted public access to the hearings and declined to stream the proceedings online, decisions that defense lawyers said violated rules on judicial transparency. The defense also accused judges of improperly limiting their opportunities to speak. One hearing descended into chaos after defense lawyers accused a prosecutor, Li Shuyao, of soliciting and accepting bribes from Wang’s children in return for reclassifying the case under less serious offenses—a promise that Li allegedly reneged on after taking the money. The defense insisted that Li be removed from the trial and wanted to play an audio recording as evidence of the prosecutor’s guilt. The court denied their requests.73

One defense lawyer, Xu Xin, grew so exasperated that he decided to quit the case. But when Xu approached his client to discuss his decision, a group of bailiffs rushed to confront the lawyer, pointing and shouting at him to stop him from speaking. A photograph of the scene went viral on Chinese social media, where users expressed incredulity at the courtroom drama. “If I keep working on this case, I might die from anger,” said Xu, who later succeeded in withdrawing.74

By then, the trial had drawn so much bad press that higher-ups decided to step in. Li, whom local officials once praised as an “honest cadre,” was placed under investigation by Baotou authorities, who later sacked the prosecutor and sentenced him to four years’ jail for corruption.75 The prosecutors’ office for Inner Mongolia, the region where Baotou is located, acknowledged that the mishandling of the case had “severely damaged public trust in the justice system.”76 The region’s top court ordered a new trial to take place in another city.77

The second trial proceeded with little fuss. Wang was sentenced to fifteen years in jail after pleading guilty to organized crime, fraud, and public disorder offenses, among other charges. His thirteen codefendants received prison terms ranging from six months to fifteen years.

Publicly, the defense team cheered the result, saying their clients received lighter sentences than they would have if the first trial had proceeded. In private, the mood was more circumspect. Some in the legal community believed the Wang case only demonstrated the deep decay in China’s criminal justice system, and that Xi’s reforms wouldn’t amount to much. “It’s just a gust of wind,” one lawyer told me. “Gone once it blows over.”78





SURVEILLANCE STATE


ONE CHILLY MORNING IN EARLY 2017, China’s top official in Xinjiang, Chen Quanguo, was cruising through the regional capital of Urumqi when he stopped his motorcade and told his aides to call the cops. Heavily armed police and paramilitary officers arrived in just fifty-four seconds, having rushed over from one of the hundreds of small police stations that blanketed the city. Chen praised the officers but demanded better. If security forces “arrive one second earlier,” he said, “the safety of the general public increases by one bit.”79

As the Communist Party chief of Xinjiang from 2016 to 2021, Chen directed a full-throttle campaign to pacify China’s northwestern frontier, forcibly assimilating Muslim minorities while building a policing regime unmatched in scale and sophistication. Some critics called him the “hard edge” of Xi Jinping’s draconian rule, who blended cutting-edge techniques with traditional tools of repression, and set a template for China’s shift toward harsher, technology-driven authoritarianism.

Building on security methods he had developed earlier in his career, Chen installed thousands of high-tech police stations throughout Xinjiang and staffed them with police and paramilitary officers. Security forces screen for threats with facial-recognition cameras and handheld devices that can scan mobile phones for sensitive material among photos, messages, and other data. Networks of surveillance cameras blanket urban areas, supported by big data and “predictive policing” systems that track suspects and identify potential threats on account of their behavior. Authorities collected wide-ranging biometric data from Xinjiang residents aged twelve to sixty-five, including DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types.80 Some of these methods have filtered to other parts of China, where authorities adapted or copied Xinjiang security techniques to address local policing needs.

Much of the Xinjiang security state runs on commercial software and gadgetry that are ubiquitous in the daily lives of ordinary Chinese. The WeChat mobile app is almost universally used in China for messaging, sharing photos and videos, paying utility bills, hailing cabs, reading news, booking doctors’ appointments, and accessing government services. Facial-recognition systems facilitate payments at restaurants and stores and identity verification at office and residential buildings. Chinese internet giants apply big data and artificial intelligence solutions to glean insights into consumer behavior.

The party grasped the potential of these technologies for social control. Security agencies, government censors, and their private-sector partners now use these systems to identify citizens in public spaces, monitor their real-world and online behavior, snoop on social media and mobile-messaging apps to detect malcontents, and even censor subversive speech almost instantaneously. Facial-recognition tools deployed to screen crowds at mass events have helped authorities nab fugitives, including several detained while attending a Hong Kong pop star’s concerts.81 In some regions, authorities deploy voice-pattern analysis systems, cameras capable of creating three-dimensional face images, and DNA sequencers to scoop up biometric data from local residents for policing purposes.

Many of these tools were first tested at scale in Xinjiang, a northwestern frontier region that borders Central Asia and is home to roughly 12 million Uyghurs, a mostly Muslim Turkic people. After China suffered a string of deadly terror attacks in 2014 that authorities attributed to Uyghur separatists, Xi ordered an all-out pacification campaign to suppress anti–Communist Party dissent and end ethnic violence—an effort that has transformed Xinjiang into one of the most heavily policed regions in the world.82 “In the face of deranged violent terrorists,” the party must “unhesitatingly and unwaveringly apply the weapons of the people’s democratic dictatorship, and focus energies on delivering a devastating blow,” Xi told officials in May 2014. “Do our utmost to leave no gaps in our defenses, and not miss any hidden dangers.”83

Chen, the man who built the Xinjiang security state, spent much of his career tackling social ferment and refining the party’s tactics for suppressing unrest. Born in 1955 into a peasant family, Chen was serving in an army artillery unit when he joined the party as a twenty-year-old in the dying days of the Cultural Revolution. People who knew Chen, whose given name can translate as “whole nation,” describe him as ambitious. He distinguished himself as a student leader at Zhengzhou University in the capital of his native Henan province, becoming president of his politics and economics class of roughly 150 people.84 As a local official in Henan, Chen won promotion faster than many peers and in the late 1980s became the youngest county chief in one of China’s most populous provinces, where rural poverty and the spread of Christian and other religious groups tore at party control.

Chen’s ascent through the Henan hierarchy coincided with China’s rapid economic growth during the reform era, which also stirred up opportunities for crime, corruption, and street protests. To contain such ferment, the party demanded that local officials ensure stability while promoting development. Local administrators needed to provide better social services, deploy closer surveillance, and achieve swifter suppression of dissent and unrest, if they wanted to score good appraisals and promotion.

Chen thrived under these requirements. After Beijing ordered a crackdown in 1999 on the Falun Gong spiritual movement, which party leaders regarded as an “evil cult,” Chen participated in the suppression as a senior provincial official, whose roles came with responsibilities over the destruction of the group’s pamphlets, books, and CDs. He later oversaw efforts to cleanse Henan party ranks of Falun Gong by re-educating and expelling offenders, according to provincial histories. Every official “knew very clearly that they had to crush Falun Gong with all their might,” according to He Sanpu, a former Henan official and Falun Gong believer, who said he was subjected to re-education classes at the time. Toward the end of his Henan stint, Chen became the deputy head of a new provincial party committee on “peace and stability building,” coordinating public security work.

In 2009, Chen was named deputy party chief of Hebei, the northern province that surrounds Beijing. During his twenty-two months there, he encountered a new grid-style policing method being tested in the provincial capital, Shijiazhuang. The city built a network of 110 “police services stations” where officers, in addition to regular duties, performed community outreach, fielding queries on municipal services and giving directions and water to elderly folk.85 The concept stemmed from the party’s “grid management” system—first tested in the early 2000s—that divides residential communities into units of several hundred households to facilitate data gathering and local governance. Authorities declared the Shijiazhuang experiment a success, saying these stations maintained a constant police presence on the streets and reduced response times to security incidents. Police agencies from dozens of other localities sent officers to study the new system.86

Chen brought that know-how to Tibet, where he was named party chief in 2011—three years after the Himalayan region was rocked by violent protests against government repression of local culture and religious beliefs.87 His job, in essence, was maintaining stability. Authorities must lay down an “inescapable net” and “ensure that there are no cracks, no blindspots,” Chen said. “Across all 1.2 million square kilometers of border territory, the voice and image of the party and government must be heard and seen.”88

Chen stationed tens of thousands of party members in villages and temples under an outreach program that doubled as a surveillance service for monitoring the restive Buddhist-majority population. He brought in grid-style policing by installing roughly seven hundred “convenience police stations”—small outposts that operated around the clock and doubled as mini community centers, equipped with household tools and cold medications. State television produced a twenty-episode drama series to glamorize these security outposts.89 While touring the Tibetan capital of Lhasa in 2012, Chen told a local storekeeper that “convenience police stations are the people’s guardian angels.”90 But many locals saw it differently. Tibet had “become the world’s largest prison,” blanketed with security checkpoints and surveillance cameras, said Dhondup Wangchen, a Tibetan filmmaker now exiled in the U.S. “You get anxiety of someone looking at you from different angles all the time.”

Chen also tried to dilute the Tibetans’ sense of ethnic identity, a precursor to the forced assimilation program he would run in Xinjiang. He promoted education in Chinese instead of in Tibetan, and offered financial and other incentives to encourage interracial marriages. Many Tibetans had their passports confiscated, and thousands of people were forced into re-education classes designed to eradicate the influence of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader whom Beijing denounces as a separatist.

Rights activists pummeled Chen, but he seemed to pay little attention. U.S. Representative Jim McGovern, who met Chen as part of a congressional delegation visiting Tibet in 2015, recalls the Chinese official as filibustering, taking up most of the two-hour meeting by lecturing his guests on China’s economic and environmental policies. “He was not interested in having a real conversation; he was giving a speech,” McGovern says. “He seemed totally unsympathetic to concerns over the human-rights situation in Tibet.”91

Chen’s methods won him favor in Beijing, which was looking for a harder-edged approach in Xinjiang as ethnic tensions escalated there. He got the job in August 2016, becoming the first Chinese official to have served as regional chief in both Tibet and Xinjiang. Days after arriving in Urumqi, he visited a police command center to demand all-out efforts to restore order. Officials must infuse themselves with “the philosophy that stability trumps everything,” said Chen, who demanded the construction of a security dragnet that has “no blind spots, no cracks, and no gaps.”92

During Chen’s first year or so in charge, Xinjiang advertised some one hundred thousand policing-related jobs and nearly doubled its annual security expenditure in 2017 from the previous year, to 58 billion yuan, or roughly $8.6 billion at the time.93 He intensified many policing measures that his predecessor had imposed, such as strict curbs on religious practices common among Uyghurs—among them men growing beards and women wearing face veils. Government data indicated that Xinjiang authorities prosecuted more than 533,000 people between 2017 and 2020, at a rate six times higher than the national average during that period.94

Chen doubled down on grid-style policing, installing more than 4,900 convenience police stations in his first four months, to create what he called a robust “system of preventive social control.” Sited about one thousand to sixteen hundred feet apart in urban areas, these one- to two-floor stations were the most advanced and multifunctional Chen had built to date, featuring amenities for residents including wireless internet, phone chargers, first-aid kits, and in some cases, even lawyers providing legal services.95 Chen tested his system’s efficacy with regular spot checks, appearing unannounced to test officers’ response times. By the summer of 2018, he had put at least 7,700 convenience police stations into operation across Xinjiang.96 Local musicians wrote a song in tribute, with lines such as “Little convenience police stations, speaking of them makes hearts feel warmth.”97

Chen scaled up networks of security cameras linked with police databases. His government tapped big-data analytics, collecting and sifting through vast pools of personal information—such as individuals’ movements, as well as banking, health, and legal records—to try to identify potential threats and anticipate crime, protest, and violence. As one engineer with a state-run defense contractor put it, the idea is to manage urban environments like battlefields and “apply the ideas of military cyber systems to the field of civilian public security.”98 In practice, the indicators used were often dubious. Authorities detained Uyghurs for showing religious piety in public, maintaining ties to relatives living overseas, owning multiple phones, or even claiming to not own any phones.99

Xinjiang became a favored proving ground for security techniques. Police agencies across China have sent officers there on exchange programs, during which participants learned new counterterrorism tactics that they would bring back for use in their home regions.100 Nearby areas with large Muslim populations, such as Qinghai province and the Ningxia region, started replicating Xinjiang’s use of convenience police stations.101 In Tibet, security agencies acquired surveillance and predictive-policing systems that attempted to forecast the activities of targeted persons, such as by reviewing data from bank accounts, social media, and cellphones to build a picture of a person’s lifestyle and social circles.102

Xinjiang-style security has emerged even in areas that haven’t suffered major ethnic violence in recent history, particularly after China’s public-security minister in 2018 praised the use of convenience police stations and called for a broader rollout.103 Nanning, the capital of the southeastern region of Guangxi, introduced dozens of police posts that are connected to the city’s digital security-management system and serve as “counterterrorism bridgeheads.” In Gansu province, home to roughly 13 million people from the Muslim Hui ethnic group, the capital of Lanzhou created a network of convenience police stations staffed with counterterrorism combat teams. Local authorities called them “urban lighthouses,” from which police and paramilitary “guardian angels” watch over the city twenty-four hours a day.104





A TANGLED WEB


AS COVID-19 TORE THROUGH CHINA in early 2020, Zhou Shaoqing took to Twitter to criticize the government response. As a former censor who scrubbed sensitive speech from some of China’s most popular mobile apps, he knew how authorities sought to control information, and thus doubted official statements about the contagion. “The Chinese Communist Party system regards stability as its principle, and in the face of big problems, everyone protects themselves,” Zhou, a thirty-year-old single father of two, wrote to his roughly three hundred followers at the time. Hospital and health officials, he said, “would all, intentionally or otherwise, reduce the number of confirmed cases and turn big problems into small ones.”105

Days later, three men showed up at Zhou’s apartment in the northeastern city of Tianjin. Dressed as neighborhood volunteers, they told Zhou that they were doing public outreach on pandemic control measures. When Zhou opened the door, the trio rushed in and pressed him onto the ground. Seven uniformed police officers followed. His young daughter started bawling as she too was held down. “I was stunned, and then I was scared,” Zhou recalls. One officer held Zhou’s phone to his face and asked if the Twitter account on it was his. “Yes,” he replied.106

While working as a content moderator at the Chinese internet firm ByteDance, Zhou helped enforce state censorship directives by removing obscene and anti-party material from the company’s popular Jinri Toutiao news aggregator app and the video-sharing platform TikTok. In private, though, Zhou was disillusioned with the party and often tweeted about his resentment of authoritarian rule.107 His posts had earned him a police reprimand in 2018, but after a lull, Zhou resumed tweeting, emboldened by the seeming lack of consequences.

This time there was no let-off. Prosecutors accused Zhou of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” by publishing and retweeting more than 120 Twitter posts that besmirched China’s leaders, its political system, and its Covid-19 response. Zhou confessed and signed a statement of repentance, hoping he could get back to his children sooner. Even so, a local court sentenced him to nine months’ jail in November 2020, including time in police custody.108 The severity of his punishment surprised Zhou, given how small his Twitter following was. “It must have been vindictive,” he said. “I felt helpless and indignant.”109

Authorities who once relied on informants to uncover what people said in private now do so with ease using digital surveillance. Sophisticated algorithms developed by Chinese tech firms can detect sensitive words and images and intercept them mid-transmission, leaving senders and would-be recipients unaware that their conversations have been censored.110 Ordinary people increasingly face harassment and punishment for imprudent comments made in social media chat rooms and messaging apps, where stray speech to family or friends can be captured as evidence.111

While direct criticism of the party and its top leaders have always drawn harsh penalties, authorities have taken an increasingly dim view even of idle backchat about politics. A construction supervisor was detained for five days after cracking jokes on WeChat about a rumored love triangle between a high-ranking Chinese official and a celebrity. An auto mechanic was punished after swearing in a WeChat group while questioning the intelligence of police officers conducting checks in the rain.112 Li Wenliang, a doctor who used WeChat to raise early alarms about the novel coronavirus in late 2019, was reprimanded by police for allegedly spreading rumors—although the penalty would be rescinded weeks after Li died from Covid-19 in February 2020, amid public outrage over how state censorship had hampered the government’s contagion response.113

China’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 boosted an already formidable state apparatus for corralling citizens.114 Authorities restricted movement with a ubiquitous smartphone-based “health code” system that classified people by their potential Covid exposure—green, yellow, or red—based on their travel history, test results, and other data. Green codes were required for entry into buildings and public spaces or domestic travel, whereas yellow and red codes typically resulted in restrictions on mobility or compulsory quarantine.115 What began as a disease-control mechanism became a handy tool for social control, as some security agencies started using health-code data to flush out fugitives and block dissidents from traveling.116 Some activists, petitioners, and rights lawyers reported instances where their health codes turned yellow or red, forcing them to scrap travel plans or go into quarantine, even though they were staying in areas with no known Covid cases.117

This practice sparked controversy in June 2022, when depositors with several rural banks in Henan seeking access to frozen funds were given red health codes as they tried to travel to the provincial capital of Zhengzhou to stage a protest and seek redress. Municipal authorities sent at least dozens of these would-be protesters into quarantine or forced them out of Zhengzhou citing their red codes—an incident that sparked national uproar over the government’s apparent abuse of the health-code system.118

The party also went after users of foreign social media services, including Twitter and Facebook, even though China blocks such platforms and the vast majority of people in the country can’t access them. Chinese users who posted allegedly subversive content—such as criticism of Xi and the party—have been detained by police, sometimes for days or even weeks. Interrogators often also ask these users to delete posts, sign pledges not to re-offend, or shut down their accounts.119 The toughened enforcement coincided with a noticeable rise in anti–Communist Party discourse on Twitter, amplified by U.S.-based operatives like fugitive Chinese businessman Guo Wengui, who were using social media to fan what many saw as disinformation about China. Beijing’s crackdown on Twitter speech forms part of its “long arm” efforts to control global narratives about China, says Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher with the advocacy group Human Rights Watch. “Propaganda only works when it is coupled with censorship of opposing views.”

The penalties grew harsher as the crackdown rumbled on. Between 2017 and early 2021, Chinese authorities sentenced more than fifty people to jail for allegedly using Twitter and other foreign social media platforms to criticize the party and its leaders, according to court and government records that I examined for a Wall Street Journal report documenting China’s increasing use of custodial sentences to punish online dissent.120 “In the past they only made threats and took statements,” said Huang Genbao, an online activist who spent sixteen months in custody after getting detained in 2019 for criticizing the party on Twitter. “This time they were doing things for real, I didn’t expect it.”

Many of those jailed had modest followings, in the hundreds or low thousands. Sun Jiadong, a Zhengzhou resident, had just twenty-seven Twitter followers when police detained him in late 2019 for allegedly spreading falsehoods about the party, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Xinjiang. In one post, Sun said: “Glory to Hong Kong, shame on Communist bandits.” Prosecutors said his tweets received 168 likes, retweets from 10 users, and comments from 95 users—enough for the court to sentence Sun to thirteen months in jail.121

Even bearing witness to the party’s authoritarian ways has become increasingly fraught. An anonymous activist who maintains an online database of Chinese law-enforcement actions against speech offenses says he believes that authorities have been trying to identify him by using technical means. The government also purged information from a state-run repository of judicial documents that had been a key source for the activist’s research. The repository, known as China Judgements Online, used to host thousands of court documents related to social media speech offenses, but the majority of such dockets disappeared over the summer of 2021, after the activist’s work gained attention through news reports by the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. “I personally feel that this was directed at my data-collection work,” said the activist, who tweets under the handle @SpeechFreedomCN. Despite the risks, “I will definitely keep doing this work,” he told me. “Because there’s no turning back.”122





CHILLING EFFECT


LU YUYU AND HIS GIRLFRIEND thought they were picking up some online shopping on a sunny summer day in 2016 when police ambushed them. It was just past noon in the southwestern city of Dali when the couple arrived at a local courier station on their electric scooter, the rice noodles they’d had for lunch still swirling in their stomachs. Lu waited by the street while his girlfriend, Li Tingyu, went inside. A posse of men surrounded him, wrestling him into a black sedan and sliding a dark shroud over his head. Moments later, he heard Li screaming his name as a group of women pushed her into another car.

“I had imagined countless times before how this day would arrive and how I should react,” Lu wrote later of his arrest.123 “But everything happened too quickly, I had no time to react, no time to fear.” The men, who identified themselves as Dali police, drove Lu to his apartment to conduct a search. As the car neared their destination, he caught a glimpse of Li with a shroud over her head. That was the last time he saw her, Lu recalls. “Perhaps the last time in this life.”124

Lu and Li were a pair of reclusive bloggers who had spent years documenting protests, strikes, and other forms of civil disorder. Their findings, published on social media, provided an invaluable resource for activists, academics, and journalists peering into the social undercurrents coursing through the world’s second-largest economy, where data on civil unrest are rare and even considered state secrets. For the Communist Party, however, the couple’s work smacked of subversion.

Police accused Lu and Li of “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” a broadly defined offense typically used for disorderly conduct such as brawling and damaging property. A couple of days passed before their friends recognized their social media silence as a sign of trouble, and rights-defense lawyers tracked the couple down to a detention center in Dali. Investigators questioned Lu for weeks, sometimes waving copies of his blog posts and tweets at him. “Why do you collect and publish this information?” one official asked, to which Lu said he was documenting history. “If you’re documenting history, you can document it on your own computer. Why publish it?” the official demanded. “History is meant for people to see,” Lu replied. “If you don’t let people see it, how can you call it history?”125

For decades, the party had tolerated a limited role for activists, rights lawyers, and nonprofits to contribute policy ideas, provide social services, and keep local officials on their toes. The number of “social organizations” in China, as the party calls NGOs, had roughly doubled from more than two hundred thousand in 1989 to nearly five hundred thousand by 2012, offering services like disaster relief and welfare for underprivileged people.126 Allowing civil society some room to operate, so the thinking went, would help authorities detect problems in society before they festered.

Xi discarded this approach, insisting that the party control all aspects of governance. Digital surveillance had made it easier for the government to track social problems on its own, and activists tackling public ills were more and more seen as usurping the party’s authority. Initially, authorities went after individual activists and small NGOs, harassing them with well-worn tactics from the Hu era. The pool of targets started widening in spring 2015, when a group of feminists were detained for planning protests against sexual harassment on public transport.127 Then came the 709 crackdown on rights defense lawyers that summer. By winter, police were rounding up more than a dozen labor activists, many of whom had helped workers engage in “collective bargaining” with employers—a sensitive practice in a country where state-controlled unions are the only legal form of organized labor.128

And then they came for foreign NGOs. Swedish activist Peter Dahlin, who ran a China-based group providing funding for local rights lawyers, was detained in January 2016 for allegedly endangering state security, forced to make a televised confession, and then deported.129 Months later, China enacted a law granting the government sweeping powers to regulate foreign nonprofits and limit the ability of local groups to work with overseas partners and obtain funding from abroad.130 By 2018, the party came to see even young Marxists as a threat. That year, authorities detained dozens of avowedly Marxist college students who staged protests in support of workers at a Shenzhen factory battling alleged management abuses, while some Chinese universities blocked Marxist groups from re-registering on campus.131

Lu and Li seemed unlikely targets even as the dragnet widened around them. The couple kept almost entirely to themselves, and hadn’t joined any organized activism. Some of their activist friends had never met them in person. But political red lines were shifting in Xi’s China, and even the most cautious dissidents were getting caught.

Lu was born in 1977 in a village outside the southern city of Zunyi, where his father ran a seedling farm. The youngest of three children, Lu was a shy boy, and his parents sent him to live with different families to learn how to interact with people. He struggled with studies and was often bullied in school. Eventually he learned to make friends and fend for himself—skipping class, playing games, and staying out late at night drinking baijiu, a fiery liquor made by fermenting sorghum.132

Lu enrolled at a local university to study politics and economics, but went to prison, aged nineteen, for wounding someone during a street fight that started, he says, because he was standing up for a friend. During his six years in jail, his mother died and his father’s business failed. Lu drifted from job to job after his release, working at factories and building sites. He discovered “dark folk” music, a mix of folk and industrial styles, and came up with his online moniker, “darkmamu,” by pairing his musical tastes with the romanized Chinese word for numbness. “I saw no hope in anything and had no direction in life,” he says.133

In 2011 he came across social media chatter about such Chinese activists as dissident artist Ai Weiwei. Censorship on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform was relatively loose at the time, and users often could debate social issues and question government policies. Inspired by what he read, Lu staged a one-man demonstration in 2012 along a tony shopping street in Shanghai, raising a banner that urged China’s leaders to declare publicly their personal assets and called for the right to vote. Police chased him out of the city. When he returned two months later, they detained him for ten days. As social unrest flared across China that year, including high-profile protests against power and copper plant projects, Lu decided to document as many incidents as he could.

He sifted through online chatter, images, and videos of public unrest, posting his findings on Weibo. He sharpened his abilities to cross-check information, corroborating details from various sources and rejecting posts he believed to be false. As the process grew more and more time-consuming, Lu quit his job at a plastics factory and threw himself into documentation work full-time, but the long hours and his dwindling savings led him to question whether his approach was sustainable. He wrote a Weibo post saying he was considering giving up. Friends and acquaintances urged him to reconsider, saying he was producing valuable insight into social conditions.134

Among those encouraging him was Li Tingyu, a university student in the coastal city of Zhuhai. Born in 1991 to working-class parents, Li grew up in relative comfort, able to indulge in her love for reading through books and access to the internet. She chose to major in English at university, knowing that English texts were less frequently censored than Chinese ones. Friends knew her as an independent-minded woman with a keen interest in politics and social affairs, who taught classmates how to circumvent China’s “Great Firewall” of internet controls.135

To Lu, Li was simply Jane. They first met online in early 2013, when Jane reached out to express admiration for Lu’s work, and their conversations soon blossomed into long-distance romance. When Lu wavered on his documentation work, Jane persuaded him to keep going. She suggested that Lu solicit donations to fund himself and open a blog and a Twitter account to disseminate his findings. She herself published an interview with him to drum up support. “The Weibo users who publish original posts about these incidents have very few followers,” Lu said in the interview. “If I don’t search for them, they either get censored or will never see the light of day.”136

Lu moved to Zhuhai to live with Jane in the summer of 2013. They started working full-time together, living off donations that streamed in from friends, acquaintances, and strangers. Their output caught the eyes of activists and academics studying social unrest in China, and local authorities started paying attention too.137 Police showed up at the couple’s apartment to warn them. Their landlord refused to renew their lease. Strangers knocked on their door and claimed they were the new tenants. Eventually they lost running water.138

The couple moved to Dali in early 2014 to escape the harassment, isolating themselves from family and friends. Even though they spent most of their time working at home and minimizing their digital footprints, police still tracked them down. By the time they were arrested in June 2016, the couple had compiled a data set comprising 67,502 protests painstakingly documented with descriptions of participants’ grievances, eyewitness accounts, photographs, and videos.139 Their last blogpost, published about an hour before police detained them, listed ninety-four incidents of unrest, including workers demanding unpaid wages and disgruntled homeowners who said they were cheated by property developers.140

During the weeks of interrogation, Lu’s thoughts would drift to his girlfriend and their pet tomcat, “Little Yellow Fur.” Police and prosecutors pressed Lu to plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence, and even brought his father to persuade him. But Lu refused. When an officer told Lu “you ruined Li Tingyu,” he wanted to reply saying it was the government that did so, but held his tongue. “Because if she hadn’t gotten to know me, she definitely wouldn’t be thrown into jail,” he recalls thinking at the time.141

Lu tried to keep his spirits up by reading books, studying English, and doing physical exercises like push-ups and sit-ups. One spring day in 2017, after being interrogated and made to watch propaganda videos for a month, he snapped. When a guard ordered him to look down during a cell inspection, he picked up a bottle and threw it at the guard. The guards pressed Lu to the ground, cuffed his wrists and ankles, and started beating him. One guard stepped on Lu’s legs. Lu spat in his face. The guard threatened to beat Lu to death. “If you don’t kill me,” Lu retorted, “I’ll look down on you.” The guard was dragged away by his colleagues. Lu started a hunger strike, demanding an apology from the guard who stepped on his leg. Officials acquiesced and the guard apologized. Lu started eating again.142

Unbeknownst to Lu, Jane had confessed. She received a suspended two-year sentence after a secret trial in April 2017, and was released soon after. Officials showed Lu a portion of the judgment against Jane and urged him to plead guilty as well, in return for leniency, but he refused. Lu stood trial at a Dali court two months later. It was a one-day affair. Lu returned to the detention center at night, feeling almost relieved. He fell asleep instantly.143

Lu was convicted and sentenced to four years in jail. He knew that an appeal would be futile, but he lodged one anyway, so that he could meet his lawyers and maintain contact with the outside world. Near the end of his appeal hearing, the judge asked Lu if he had anything to say. Lu told the court that he had documented about seventy thousand mass incidents in total. “By your standards of sentencing me to four years for eight Weibo posts, my jail sentence ought to be thirty-five thousand years,” he said. Laughter rippled through the courtroom. The stone-faced judge adjourned the hearing.

Lu served his sentence in a Dali prison, where he lived in a twelve-man cell and worked ten-hour shifts sewing jeans, skirts, and other apparel to earn the equivalent of a few dollars a month. The tedium wore on Lu, who said he suffered hallucinations and bouts of paranoia. Prison officials offered counseling, but his symptoms persisted.144

After his release, Lu settled down in Zunyi, where local police monitored him, visiting and calling him from time to time. He opened a new Twitter account, but the police soon came knocking, censuring him for illegally circumventing internet controls, and temporarily seizing his mobile phone and computer.

Lu tried tracking down Jane. He first reached her mother, who said her daughter had gotten married. A disbelieving Lu insisted on hearing from Jane directly. She called that night, telling Lu that she had started a new life, before breaking down and saying she was sorry. Lu knew then that it was over. He told Jane that he respected her choice.145

To clear his mind, Lu started traveling to nearby cities and provinces. He posted photos from his trips on social media, including shots of the lush riverside cliffs, cattle on a grassy mountain, and local dishes that he enjoyed. Police tracked his movements closely. Each time he reached a different city or region, an official would call him and ask, “What are you doing?” Lu knew it was pointless to lie. “It was very obvious he was pretending not to know where I was,” Lu recalls. “It’s too scary. There’s no way to hide.” During one trip to the southern city of Guangzhou, local police detained him, extracted data from his phone, and put him on a train back to Zunyi.146

Back home, local police would regularly call Lu or summon him for meetings. One landlord evicted Lu, citing pressure from the government. Even after he moved in 2021 to Dandong, a city in northeastern China that borders North Korea, police in his hometown continued calling him at least once a month, telling him not to tweet anything sensitive. Officers from Zunyi sometimes even made the thirteen-hundred-mile trip to check on Lu in Dandong, taking him out for meals and snapping photos to document their visits.147

Lu’s experience is common among prosecuted dissidents, who often face psychological pressure and social stigma that extend well after their judicial punishment ends. “Their goal is to make you feel helpless, hopeless, devoid of any support, and break you down so you begin to see activism as something foolish that doesn’t benefit anyone, and gives pain to everyone around you,” says Yaxue Cao, a Washington-based activist who runs China Change, a human-rights news website. “In so many cases, they are successful.”

Jane faced similar scrutiny during her three-year probation. She had to report regularly to local authorities and social workers, attend politics and civics classes, and wear an electronic bracelet that tracked her movements. She found work, first as an English teacher and then a translator, and met a new boyfriend, but struggled to settle into her new life. People who learned about her past often treated her like a former cult member who’d gotten brainwashed into doing bad things. Many of her colleagues expressed pro-party and nationalistic views that jarred with her liberal leanings. “I had to keep lying to them about who I am, what I believe, in order to fit in,” she recalls. “My life was made up of lies.”148

The sense of dissonance drove Jane to leave China. She spent about six months preparing her exit—sorting out travel papers, creating a cover story, and sanitizing her social media presence. She told acquaintances, coworkers, and even her mother that she was going away to study in Germany. She removed sensitive material from her mobile phone, such as software for circumventing internet controls, and filled the device instead with content commensurate with her cover story. The subterfuge paid off. With help from friends and activists, Jane left China without incident in June 2022—her first-ever trip abroad—and arrived in Berlin to start a new life. “I had lost my voice for so many years,” Jane says. “Now I want to make use of my new status to say all the things I couldn’t say before, and do all the things I couldn’t do before.”149

Lu hasn’t been as fortunate. He says he has battled bouts of depression and struggled to find work. When he applied for a passport, authorities barred him from leaving China, but told him they might change their minds if he watched his words online. Lu remains proud of his documentation work, but believes he could never reprise that role. “If you’re lucky, they’d detain you within a month, or if you’re unlucky, within a week,” he says. “You can tell people how brave you are, but in reality you wouldn’t achieve anything.”150
