title: 4 Caging the Economy—The Party Gets Back to Business
---




“Invigorating the economy must be done under planned guidance.… This is like the relationship between a bird and a cage. A bird shouldn’t be squeezed in one’s hand, or it will die. We must let it fly, but fly only within the cage. Without the cage, it would fly away.”

—Chen Yun, Communist Party elder


“Private entrepreneurs should cherish their social image, love the motherland, love the people, and love the Chinese Communist Party.”

—Xi Jinping



In the early summer of 2015, China’s stock markets were soaring. The Shanghai and Shenzhen indices hit their highest levels in seven years, juiced by the government’s appeals for investors to pour money into equities and help indebted companies raise funds. Greenhorn buyers charged headlong into the fray, many with little more than a middle-school education and borrowed money.1 Chinese investors opened more than 30 million new stock-trading accounts over the first five months of the year, some three times the total added in 2014.2 The website of the Communist Party’s flagship newspaper, People’s Daily, published a commentary that dismissed concerns about a frothy market, saying the already prodigious rally was just beginning.3 Those swept up in the euphoria scavenged for whatever shares they could find, desperate not to miss out on what people were calling the “Uncle Xi bull market.”

Then, in the middle of June, with markets up by more than 160 percent over the preceding year, the bubble burst. Stocks slumped on the first trading day after Beijing signaled it would tighten rules on margin trading, or the buying of stocks with borrowed money. Panicked investors rushed for the exits, turning a dip into a rout. Novices dabbling in stocks on advice from friends, even their hairdressers, watched helplessly as their stakes evaporated.4 About half of China-listed companies suspended trading on their shares at one point to stem losses.5 When the central bank loosened controls on the yuan, the Chinese currency took a pummeling that drove more capital out of the country. Hundreds of billions of dollars were wiped off global markets.

The crash spooked China’s leadership. In a meeting with economic and financial officials, General Secretary Xi Jinping voiced his dismay at the government’s economic management, noting how the Economist magazine had splashed the market turmoil on its cover—with an image depicting the Chinese leader with his arms raised trying to hold up a plunging stock index.6

To stop the bleeding, officials launched the most heavy-handed state intervention in Chinese stock markets since they debuted a quarter century earlier. A shadowy collective of state-linked investors, known as the “national team,” spent hundreds of billions of yuan buying shares to prop up prices. Major investors were told to hold on to their stakes to prevent further selloffs.7 Regulators suspended new share sales, curbed margin trades, cracked down on investors who bet on stocks to fall, froze suspicious trading accounts, and launched probes into alleged financial misconduct. Authorities introduced a “circuit breaker” mechanism, which suspends trading when shares fall too sharply, only to rescind it days later after it exacerbated losses.8 The central bank imposed “countercyclical” controls to prop up the yuan and curb capital outflows. Senior financial regulators were ousted, while some high-profile fund managers were detained and punished for market manipulation.9 For Xi, the implications were clear: the markets had failed, and the state had to save the day.

Less than two years before, the party’s elite Central Committee had vowed to give market forces a “decisive role” in allocating resources in the world’s second-largest economy.10 While the November 2013 decision was far from a free-market manifesto, given its affirmation of the state sector’s “dominant role,” it committed the party to sustaining the reforms China had embarked upon since the late 1970s under Deng Xiaoping—the selective application of capitalist principles that transformed a sterile command economy into a global manufacturing powerhouse, and brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty.11 Even while Xi emerged as a political hardliner, some party insiders still hoped he would live up to his record as a business-friendly provincial leader, and honor his father’s legacy as a pro-market reformer.

Xi seemed set on economic liberalization early on in his leadership. He promised to overhaul bloated state firms and boost private industry. His administration talked up equity markets, eased controls on the yuan, and even flirted with proposals to allow professional managers to handle day-to-day operations in state businesses—an approach modeled after Singapore’s state-investment company Temasek Holdings.12 Nicholas Lardy, a respected China analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, described this trend in a 2014 book titled Markets Over Mao, documenting how private firms superseded a retreating state sector as the dominant driver of China’s economy.

The 2015 meltdown upended this trajectory, turning the party’s perennial skepticism of market forces into full-blown distrust. For Xi, the capitalist principles that spurred breakneck growth had become too fraught, seeding more disorder than prosperity and overwhelming government overseers. The vagaries of boom-bust cycles and excesses of private capital clashed with Xi’s instincts for control, jeopardized social stability, and—if unchecked—could threaten the party’s hold on power.

Chen Yun, a revered revolutionary regarded as China’s second most powerful leader during the Deng era, once likened the economy to “a bird in a cage.” If the cage of state control was too small, the bird would suffocate. But without the cage, the bird would fly away. As Xi saw it, decades of market-oriented reforms had expanded the cage so much that the bird was flying free. Unless he shrunk the cage and restored the party’s dominance over the commanding heights of the economy, his China Dream of ennobling a new superpower could come to naught.13

Since taking power in late 2012, Xi has discarded his predecessors’ hands-off approach to economic management and doubled down on “top-level design,” whereby Beijing supervises policy down to the grassroots. He’s unveiled grandiose development programs, from the Belt and Road initiative to build global trade infrastructure to his “thousand-year project” to create a new megacity known as the Xiong’an New Area. He declared economic affairs a key component of national security, and demanded compliance with his development agenda as a matter of patriotic duty. State planners sought to engineer economic outcomes, from raw-material prices to stock and currency values. Beijing directed a wave of mergers and acquisitions that turned state-run giants into global behemoths that could dominate sectors such as train manufacturing, shipbuilding, steel, and power utilities.14 State companies received preferential access to credit, land, and other resources, squeezing out private-sector rivals. Party cells in private firms sought bigger roles in management that allow them to align corporate priorities with government goals. As Xi told a group of business leaders, they must honor the “glorious tradition of listening to the party’s words and following the party’s path.”15

That path has led China away from Deng’s economic formula, which encouraged bottom-up innovation and integration with global markets, and closer to Xi’s principles of top-down control and self-reliance. A bruising trade war and geopolitical tensions with the United States added urgency to Xi’s plans, spurring calls for China to become more self-sufficient and, over the long term, challenge America for global supremacy in advanced technology like artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and fifth-generation mobile networks. In totality, Xi wants to roll back China’s decades-long drift toward Western-style capitalism and forge a strong, interventionist state—one that hews more closely to Mao’s egalitarian ethos.16

Echoing how U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt reined in America’s robber barons with antitrust actions, Xi denounced Chinese tycoons for pursuing “barbaric growth” and vowed to curb their excesses in the name of delivering “common prosperity”—a populist slogan Mao used to promote collectivized ownership in the 1950s.17 Insofar as the party had been indifferent to how state-led capitalism was creating wealth unsustainably and spreading it unevenly, Xi promised to shape a more equitable society.18 He directed regulatory crackdowns against some of China’s biggest private companies and vowed to curtail “the disorderly expansion of capital” that could lead to political polarization, populist backlash, and social instability.19

Xi’s statist approach brought its own risks. The government bureaucracy became increasingly encumbered by inflexibility and indecision, as overzealous officials take Xi’s edicts too far, while others dither in fear of punishment for acting without approval. Beijing’s reluctance to impose market discipline on state-owned enterprises allowed them to become more heavily indebted while channeling funds into wasteful projects. Credit-starved private firms accounted for a shrinking share of investments in factories, buildings, and other infrastructure. Xi’s insistence that entrepreneurs serve the party fostered what critics call a “hyper-politicized” business environment, dampening enthusiasm to invest and innovate. Economists say China could fall into a “middle-income trap,” where rising wages erode the country’s edge in low-skill manufacturing before it can make the gains in technology and productivity needed to compete with advanced economies.

The party has no easy options for avoiding these pitfalls. Market-oriented reforms can boost efficiency but threaten powerful interest groups that benefit from state largesse. Shutting loss-making factories would reduce excess capacity, but also spur mass layoffs that would fuel unrest. Raising taxes and the retirement age can ease fiscal burdens but also drag consumption and stoke public resentment. Whatever the choices, however, there’s only one outcome that matters for Xi: the party must win, and it must always win.





MAO VERSUS MARKETS


AS CHIANG KAI-SHEK’S NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT crumbled in the dying months of the Chinese civil war, many of the country’s wealthy elite scurried to escape. Mao Zedong had promised to eliminate capitalism in his “new China,” and fearful entrepreneurs sought refuge in places such as British Hong Kong and Nationalist-controlled Taiwan. The exodus worried the Communist Party, whose leaders wanted to tap the capitalist class for their money, business nous, and ties with foreign markets, to rebuild their battered nation.20 Soon after the People’s Liberation Army captured Tianjin in early 1949, one of Mao’s top lieutenants, Liu Shaoqi, traveled to the port city and met with local businessmen seeking assurances on their fate under Communist rule.

Zhou Shutao, a Tianjin industrialist, confided in Liu his concerns over the morality of expanding his cement and textiles business. A father to two party members, Zhou conceded that he was a part of the exploiting class. He worried that the more factories he opened, the more exploitation would take place, and his sins would become so grave that the party would shoot him if it decided to settle scores. Liu disabused Zhou of his fears. “I said, you want to open a fourth factory, the workers you exploit would increase, does this count as a crime?” Liu said in a speech recounting his conversation with Zhou. “Not only is it not a crime, it would be a meritorious contribution.”21 Citing Marx, Liu defended the “progressiveness” of capitalist exploitation under certain conditions. “Is it better to exploit more workers, or is it better to exploit fewer workers?” he said. “It’s better to exploit more.”22

The party seized power later that year, pledging to build a “united front” with noncommunist groups and work across ideological lines in service of nation building. Entrepreneurs willing to work with the party were given space to operate, and some even received roles in government. They were designated the “national bourgeoisie,” distinguishing them from the “bureaucratic capitalists” who had ties to the Nationalists.

Such collaboration was short-lived, as party leaders saw private trade as merely a dispensable tool for building a state-run economy.23 In 1952, Mao launched the “Five-Antis” campaign against economic crimes—bribery, tax evasion, cheating on government contracts, as well as theft of state property and economic data—that in practice served as a way to appropriate wealth from business owners, who were often publicly denounced and, in some cases, driven to suicide. By the late 1950s, the party had virtually crushed the private sector and seized all major industrial and commercial assets.24

Mao’s command economy doubled as a tool of totalitarian control. State companies provided an “iron rice bowl” for workers, who enjoyed permanent employment at their work units—danwei in Chinese—and could be dismissed only for criminal or political offenses that resulted in imprisonment.25 Work units took care of people’s needs from the cradle to the grave, typically providing their staff with housing, clothing, food, entertainment, and education for their children.26 Workers’ lives revolved around their danwei, which monitored every employee; maintained dossiers on their family background, social class, education, and political demeanor; and controlled their ability to travel or even get married.27 Productivity frequently suffered, as factories were often overstaffed and workers generally content to meet minimum output quotas without concern for the quality or marketability of what they made.28

China lurched toward economic disaster in 1958 when Mao launched the Great Leap Forward, a campaign that aimed at catapulting the country toward socialist utopia but ended up causing one of history’s deadliest famines. Convinced that mass mobilization could accelerate an agrarian society’s development into a modern industrialized state, Mao urged his compatriots to create rural farming and industrial collectives—known as “people’s communes”—and channeled vast resources to chasing fanciful production targets. This change led to a deadly cycle of self-deception as officials, afraid of being purged for contradicting Mao, reported inflated agricultural output and delivered nonexistent surpluses by taking from grain stocks needed to feed the rural populace. Food supplies were diverted to the cities at the expense of the countryside, where tens of millions of people died. The party nudged the economy toward a tentative recovery in the early 1960s, only for Mao to wipe out those gains with his Cultural Revolution.

When Mao died in 1976, he left behind an impoverished populace and an economy shattered by mismanagement and isolation from global trade. Deng Xiaoping reoriented the party from revolution to modernization in a program that became known as “reform and opening up.” He spurned socialist dogma, advocating a more practical approach to development that tolerated a degree of capitalist excess and inequality.29 Whereas Mao’s planned economy was encapsulated by the slogan “politics in command,” Deng’s methods put “economics in command,” guided by steely pragmatism.30 “My consistent position is to allow some people and some regions to get rich first,” Deng said. “Some regions can develop a little bit faster, and then bring along the majority. This is the shortcut to accelerating development and achieving common prosperity.”31

Under Deng, the party broke up agricultural collectives and allowed farmers to sell surpluses on open markets. China established “special economic zones” in coastal regions, where local officials could experiment with preferential policies to boost commerce and attract foreign investment. Beijing cut back on central planning, easing price controls and allowing state-owned enterprises, or SOEs, to sell goods at market prices after they satisfied yearly targets. Private businesses emerged again, though entrepreneurs still faced harassment and persecution amid a murky legal environment. Many businesses sought political cover by registering as “red hat collectives,” or state firms under the control of local governments.

Deng’s reforms proved politically fraught. Corruption and inflation soared in the late 1980s, at times spurring price spikes and panic buying in the cities, and even fueling mass demonstrations. Party infighting over the scope and pace of change intensified, particularly after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, and the fall of the Iron Curtain gave conservative elders the opportunity to purge liberal-minded colleagues and block policies they considered too capitalistic. To revive his reformist agenda, Deng embarked upon his “southern tour” in early 1992, inspecting the front lines of economic liberalization—including the cities of Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shanghai—and praising their pro-market policies. Party conservatives suppressed state media coverage of the tour for weeks before Jiang Zemin, the general secretary at the time, sided with Deng. Later that year, Jiang declared that China aimed to build a “socialist market economy,” enshrining Deng’s path as official policy.

Foreign investment poured in, bringing much-needed funds, technology, and expertise that transformed China into the workshop of the world. Total value of exports more than tripled, from about $85 billion in 1992 to $266 billion in 2001, when the country joined the World Trade Organization.32 Beijing culled the state sector on the principle of “grasping the large, releasing the small,” keeping control of major state-owned enterprises while allowing smaller ones to be privatized, restructured, or shut down.33 Millions were laid off, and by one estimate, employment across state enterprises plunged from a peak of 76 million workers in 1992 to 43 million by 2005.34 But a booming private sector more than made up for it, fueling a surge in urban employment and soaking up China’s growing legions of cheap labor.35 By 2012, private firms were contributing an estimated 70 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and more than two-thirds of its urban labor force.36 China leapfrogged Britain, France, Germany, and Japan to become the world’s second-biggest economy by 2010, trailing only the U.S.37 Standards of living soared, with GDP per capita in purchasing power terms more than doubling, from about $4,000 in 2002 to roughly $10,300 in 2012, and lifting the People’s Republic firmly into the ranks of middle-income nations.38

The state sector remained a key asset for the party. Hu Jintao’s administration created a specialized agency—the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or Sasac—to manage major SOEs and turn them into “national champions” that could drive China’s development as an industrial power. Sasac-controlled SOEs continued receiving preferential treatment, avoided antitrust scrutiny on their acquisitions, and benefited from restrictions that hampered competitors trying to break into key sectors. Beijing tested ways to improve corporate governance at state firms, such as introducing external directors and linking executives’ pay to performance. China’s big four state banks went public, imposing some market discipline on their lending decisions.

For a time, the strategy seemed to work. China’s state juggernauts gained international prominence as they started splashing their cash. More than half of Chinese companies listed in the 2012 Fortune Global 500 were central government–supervised SOEs, including energy and resources giants on a buying binge to satiate China’s surging appetite for commodities.39 By one estimate, Chinese firms grew their value share of global mergers and acquisitions in the oil and natural gas sector from less than 3 percent in 2005 to about 15 percent in 2012.40 Western observers dubbed them “China, Inc.,” portraying a powerful cabal of cash-rich state companies advancing Beijing’s interests around the world.

But China, Inc., was far from the fearsome monolith that some imagined. Many state firms remained wastefully inefficient, and instead of working together to support Beijing’s industrial strategy, they pursued their own interests and often acted at cross-purposes. Corruption grew rife amid lax oversight. In 2009, a former chairman of state oil giant Sinopec was handed a suspended death sentence—a de facto life term—for taking nearly 200 million yuan in bribes. Graft charges also brought down China National Nuclear Corporation’s general manager and a top executive at China Mobile, who were jailed in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

Critics called the Hu era a “lost decade,” when China missed its chance to pursue a more sustainable development path—one more reliant on domestic consumption and less on exports and debt-fueled infrastructure spending. Hemmed in by factional squabbling and vested interests, Hu presided over tentative reforms and policy gridlock that kicked economic cans down the road. Beijing’s response to the global financial crisis exacerbated the problem. Its massive stimulus program, worth trillions of yuan, indulged China’s addiction to easy credit, fueled corruption, and spurred wasteful investments on real estate and heavy-polluting industries. The economy remained vulnerable to shifts in global demand. Excess housing, industrial overcapacity, and debt overhangs weighed on growth, which slipped from a breathless 10 percent per year toward a “new normal” of slowing, single-digit expansion.

The social costs were severe. Pollution and environmental degradation worsened, with dense smog often suffocating Beijing and other major cities. Inequality swelled between rural and urban areas, as well as within cities, where migrant workers from the countryside received far lower wages than registered urban residents. The top 20 percent of households in China controlled more than two-thirds of disposable income, according to research published in 2012 by Chinese economist Gan Li, compared to the one-half held by America’s top quintile. Gan’s data also showed that China’s Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality scaled from zero to one, whereby zero represents complete equality, had reached 0.61—surpassing the U.S. equivalent of roughly 0.48 at the time.41 On top of that, China’s fast-aging population meant it could grow old before getting rich, while public anger over corruption, pollution, and land grabs chipped away at the party’s legitimacy.

Without forceful interventions, the Chinese dynamo could sputter out, unable to boost wages and create enough jobs to sustain a shift toward a more balanced economy. Xi privately blamed a feeble central leadership for the party’s failure to address these ills. He promised change, and to do so, he would first put politics back in command.





THE STATE STRIKES BACK


FOR HIS FIRST TRIP OUTSIDE BEIJING since becoming general secretary in 2012, Xi Jinping replicated a famous journey that a revered predecessor had made to spur China’s economic miracle. Two decades after Deng Xiaoping’s “southern tour,” Xi retraced some of those footsteps by traveling to the bustling industrial province of Guangdong, where he laid a wreath before a bronze statue of Deng and paid tribute to the late leader’s achievements.42

Xi’s gesture conveyed a message of continuity, one he followed up with crowd-pleasing promises to dial back government stimulus, reduce debt, and liberalize interest rates. Pro-market reformers saw more positive signals emanating from a 2013 party conclave, known as the Third Plenum, where Xi approved a new economic blueprint calling for markets to play a “decisive” part in allocating resources, an upgrade on past commitments to allow them a “basic” role. But there was a catch. The party also insisted that public ownership would remain dominant, vowing to boost the state sector’s influence and vitality. The document, as one foreign analyst noted, “promised something for everyone.”43

The mixed messaging spurred debate over the merits of state control versus free markets. In the months after the Third Plenum, two prominent economists at the prestigious Peking University jousted over what the party’s pronouncements meant. Zhang Weiying, a free-market advocate, called for a hands-off government that limited its role to fostering open, equal, and competitive markets. Justin Yifu Lin, a former World Bank chief economist turned government adviser, countered that the state must mitigate the foibles of capricious markets. The respected financial magazine Caixin called the debate “reminiscent of the clashes between John Keynes and Friedrich Hayek that shaped major developed countries’ economic policies for most of the last century.”44 And for a time, pro-market advocates seemed to gain ground in this battle of ideas.

Premier Li Keqiang led an early charge to boost private industry and slim a bloated state sector. He promised to help entrepreneurs by reducing taxes, cutting red tape, providing more credit, and using internet technologies to support commerce.45 He urged efforts to develop the financial sector, such as by encouraging peer-to-peer lending and online insurance sales.46 Officials touted stock investing as a way to stimulate spending, turn equities markets into a funding vehicle for businesses, and help local governments and companies unwind debt. Policy-makers cut interest rates, gave international investors more access to the Shanghai stock market, and made it easier to trade with borrowed money. Chinese indices surged despite a slowdown in the broader economy, helping indebted companies sell shares and clear up their balance sheets. In early 2015, just months before Chinese stocks collapsed, Li praised regulators for making it easier for companies to get listed, an effort that he credited for creating wealth for the nation and the people. 47

Li slashed state industry, pledging to eliminate loss-making “zombie enterprises” in sectors such as steel and coal, while applying market mechanisms to unwind ills born from state largesse. Authorities launched a program to introduce mixed ownership for SOEs, hoping that private shareholders could bring in capital and exert pressure on state firms to improve their performances. As mentioned, Beijing even considered adopting the “Temasek model,” whereby government-backed investment firms would take ownership of state businesses and appoint professional managers to run them—a move that would all but neuter Sasac, the agency overseeing SOEs, which U.S. officials once described as “the world’s largest and most powerful holding company.”48

Sasac officials battled to persuade Xi that his core political objective—strengthening the Communist Party’s dominance—was best served by tightening Beijing’s grip on state enterprises and expanding their economic footprint. The alternative, they argued, would slow growth, drive up unemployment, and ultimately destabilize society.49 The 2015 stock crash reinforced Sasac’s warnings, fueling fears that market forces were more agents of chaos than levers of economic efficiency. The internal wrangling reached a crescendo over the summer of 2016, when the Xi and Li camps delivered contradictory messages on how to reform China’s state sector. In internal remarks, the general secretary called for “stronger, better, bigger” state enterprises, while the premier stressed the need to “slim down” SOEs and remake them in accordance with market rules.50

Xi prevailed. Li, once seen as an advocate for economic liberalization, faded into the background while Liu He, one of Xi’s closest advisers, assumed leading roles in economic, financial, and trade affairs.51 He Lifeng, a confidant whom Xi befriended in Fujian, came out of semiretirement for senior roles at the powerful National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, the state economic planning agency. Efforts to impose more market discipline on SOEs petered out. Dozens of Hong Kong–listed SOEs revised their articles of association to add direct references to the Communist Party and give their in-house party committees a more explicit role in decision-making.52 Sasac’s assets swelled to more than 63 trillion yuan by 2019, from 35 trillion yuan in 2013.53 “Nobody talks about the Temasek model anymore,” a Sasac official told the Wall Street Journal. “It has been determined that model isn’t applicable to China.”54 Lardy, the China analyst who wrote Markets Over Mao, reversed his assessment in a new book, titled The State Strikes Back.

Open debates over Xi’s economic policies became all but taboo. Lou Jiwei, an outspoken technocrat, lost his job as finance minister in 2016 after serving just three and a half years out of a full five-year term. He was ousted again in 2019, when he stepped down as chief of the national social security fund after describing China’s industrial policy as a waste of money.55 Authorities harassed academics, analysts, and journalists who contradicted Beijing’s economic narratives, warned them against airing gloomy views, and censored their social media accounts when they disobeyed.56 The Unirule Institute of Economics, an independent Beijing think tank that had championed pro-market ideas since its founding in 1993, shut down in 2019 under government pressure.57 Zhang Weiying, the free-market economist, says he has found it harder to get his writings published.58 His statist colleague, Justin Lin, remained an adviser to the Chinese leadership.

But for all his powers, Xi hasn’t always delivered decisive breakthroughs in policy. Even though officials have long promised to raise the statutory retirement age—unchanged since the 1950s—to cope with China’s rapidly aging population, the Xi administration missed a self-imposed 2017 deadline to unveil detailed retirement-age reforms, and continued to demur through Xi’s second term as general secretary. Beijing has so far also shown little appetite for phasing out China’s hukou residence permit system, which keeps rural residents from swamping urban areas by denying them subsidized social services unless they hold household registrations, or hukou, for urban areas—restrictions that economists say should be dismantled to encourage more urbanization and boost consumption.

Conversely, the state’s visible hand has proven too forceful at times. In the fall of 2021, when the NDRC demanded lower energy usage to meet Xi’s targets for slashing carbon emissions, local authorities rushed to comply by shutting coal mines, ordering power cuts, and suspending production at factories.59 Their efforts disrupted global supply chains, drove up coal prices, and threatened to leave millions of people freezing over winter. Beijing was forced to reverse course and call for more coal production. Local governments obliged.60

Despite such shocks, Xi sees a strong state as an anchor for the economy—providing jobs, implementing industrial policies, and ensuring stability during spells of volatility. SOEs led the way in Xi’s Belt and Road initiative to build global trade infrastructure and the “Made in China 2025” campaign to acquire advanced capabilities in industries like aerospace and robotics. They kept an outsize presence in Chinese markets, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the domestic stock market and the bulk of bond issuances.61 When President Donald Trump waged a trade war against China, imposing tariffs and curbing Chinese access to American markets and technology, Xi channeled more resources toward the state sector, tasking them to develop indigenous know-how that China needs to become economically self-sufficient.62 When Covid-19 forced China into lockdown in early 2020, SOEs helped shore up the economy by ramping up investments while private firms pulled back.

Xi still insists that private industry remain a cornerstone of his economic vision. He arranged high-profile meetings with Chinese entrepreneurs, assuring them of his commitment to the non-state economy, while urging private businesses to “proactively take on responsibilities for the nation, and share in the nation’s worries.”63 His lieutenants laud the private sector’s economic weight with the phrase “56789”—a reference to how it generates 50 percent of tax revenues, 60 percent of GDP, 70 percent of technological innovations, employs 80 percent of urban workers, and accounts for 90 percent of registered companies.64

What Xi wants, some experts argue, is a hybrid system that combines central planning with market mechanisms, where state and private enterprises act in concert to advance the party’s economic agenda. While Beijing nudges SOEs to become more efficient and profit-driven, the party wants private firms to show more loyalty and work proactively to serve national interests. Jude Blanchette, a China analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, dubbed this new model “CCP Inc.”—a broad ecosystem comprising state, private, and hybrid-ownership companies that operate across entire value chains, tap international capital markets, and align with the party’s industrial strategies. Or as Sasac’s party chief put it, “whether they are state-owned or private enterprises, they are all Chinese enterprises.”65 The question of ownership wouldn’t matter as long as they sing in tune with the party. Going off key would be costly.





FOLLOWING THE PARTY


DAYS BEFORE JACK MA was to launch the world’s largest initial public offering in history, one that would raise more than $34 billion for his financial technology giant Ant Group, the Chinese billionaire was preparing to thumb his nose again at government regulators who had tried and failed to rein in his businesses. The dual listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong, set for November 2020, would be a crowning achievement for one of China’s richest entrepreneurs. A self-made business superstar, Ma was idolized by many Chinese for founding Alibaba Group and turning it from a scrappy e-commerce website into the leading company in the world’s largest online-retail market. Along the way, he transformed how Chinese consumers shop and drew comparisons with the likes of Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.

Ant emerged from the Alibaba empire, first as an online escrow service, before swelling into a financial behemoth in its own right, handling everything from processing digital payments to selling investment products to running China’s largest mutual fund. The company runs a highly popular mobile payment app, Alipay, and has become a vital cog in the economy—by extending loans to tens of millions of small businesses and half a billion individuals who otherwise found it hard to borrow from traditional banks.66 Imbued with Ma’s go-getting ethos, Ant pushed regulatory limits and irked officials who worried the firm was saddling China’s financial system with excessive risk. With help from powerful backers, Ant got its way for years, fending off government efforts to corral the firm under the tougher regulations and capital requirements that commercial lenders face.

Ahead of the company’s mega listing, Ant’s rambunctious attitude veered into what critics saw as arrogance. Prospective investors were given limited spaces for meetings with Ant management and were expected to make presentations to persuade the company to accept their investments. When Ant announced that it would trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange under the ticker 688688, an auspicious set of numbers that symbolize good fortune and prosperity in Chinese culture, netizens marveled at the brazen flexing of corporate clout. A splashy IPO would be a crowning achievement for Ma, and as hype bubbled up before debut day, he couldn’t resist basking publicly in his imminent success.

Ma chose his stage for maximum impact—a financial forum in Shanghai attended by China’s vice president, top regulators, and senior bankers. Only a small group of subordinates had an inkling of what was to come when he stepped up to the lectern that late October morning. Ma opened with a dash of feigned modesty, describing himself as a “non-official, non-professional person” who felt torn about whether he should address the event. Then, over the next twenty minutes, he tore into China’s financial establishment, portraying them as stuffy stewards of a bygone era who must be dragged into the digital age. He accused regulators of stifling innovation with outmoded rules and excessive interventions, contradicting Vice President Wang Qishan’s earlier exhortations for more safeguards against systemic risks. Ma chided banks for harboring a “pawnshop mentality”—a reference to industry practice of securing loans with collateral—that impedes businesses from getting capital. “Good innovation doesn’t fear being regulated, but it does fear being regulated with yesterday’s methods,” he said. “We cannot use yesterday’s methods to manage the future.”

Ma’s speech went viral on Chinese social media, where some users cheered his straight-talking jibes. Senior officials, however, recoiled from what they saw as impertinent grandstanding—a “punch in their faces,” as one put it.67 Within hours, Xi ordered regulators to investigate the Ant IPO and officials started compiling reports on Ma’s companies, including how Ant used digital financial products to encourage unbridled borrowing and spending.68 Three days before Ant’s trading debut, China’s central bank and its securities, banking, and foreign exchange regulators summoned Ma and two top Ant executives for a dressing down.69 The IPO was suspended the next day.70

Ma’s public humbling stunned China. The government had indulged the billionaire’s brash ways for years, on account of his political connections and national pride in his success. Now, with Ma’s defenses breached, regulators rushed to launch probes and enforcement actions against his companies.71 China’s antitrust agency imposed a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba for anticompetitive business practices, such as punishing certain merchants who sold goods both on Alibaba and on rival e-commerce platforms.72 The central bank and the state agencies overseeing securities, banking, and insurance rapped Ant for circumventing financial controls through “regulatory arbitrage” and providing services that saddled consumers with greater risks. Officials who had supported Alibaba started echoing Beijing’s priorities in preventing big tech firms from monopolizing credit, and told the company it could no longer count on their backing.73 Within the Alibaba-Ant empire, dissension flared as employees took to internal discussion boards to attack Ma as “the biggest source of instability” within the firm.

The collapse of the Ant IPO was just the beginning. Beijing directed a wave of regulatory crackdowns against private businesses over subsequent months, investigating and punishing tech firms over issues including antitrust, data security, and financial risks. Ride-hailing group DiDi was hit with cybersecurity probes soon after going public on Wall Street, prompting the company to delist from the U.S. and seek a new listing in Hong Kong.74 China’s lucrative private-tutoring sector, seen as driving up parenting costs, was crippled overnight by new rules that limited the length and scheduling of classes and banned public advertising of such services.75 Regulators slapped the digital-gaming sector with limits on the number of hours that youth could play online games, citing efforts to battle the gaming addiction that officials blame for distracting people from school and damaging their health.76

Ma wasn’t the first entrepreneur to face the party’s wrath, nor would he be the last. Fearing the emergence of a powerful oligarch class similar to Russia’s, China wants to keep its captains of private industry under the party’s thumb, and prevent them from building networks that can operate beyond state control or even become rival centers of power. Under Xi, the party had already taken action against some of the biggest names in Chinese business. In 2017, authorities curbed state-bank lending to property developer Dalian Wanda Group, forcing its billionaire founder Wang Jianlin—once China’s richest man—to pare back what some officials saw as risky investments.77 Wu Xiaohui, who turned Anbang Insurance Group into China’s third-largest insurer and a global dealmaker, received an eighteen-year jail sentence in 2018 for committing fraud and abusing power.78 Even so, many Chinese saw Ma’s public humbling as a watershed moment.

A former English teacher fond of Chinese martial arts novels, Ma founded Alibaba in 1999 with seventeen others in his apartment in Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang province. Starting out as an online marketplace for businesses to sell goods to each other, Alibaba exploded into life by launching its Taobao platform for merchants to sell directly to consumers—success that helped Ma expand into online retail and banking, cloud computing, media, and entertainment. Over time, Alibaba built stakes in or controlled some major Chinese media platforms, including the Weibo microblogging service and Hong Kong’s English-language broadsheet South China Morning Post.

Ma attained almost divine status within his business empire, revered as a “teacher” by subordinates who regarded each other as “classmates.”79 Legions of young Chinese fans credited Ma for inspiring them to chase opportunities beyond stodgy careers in public service and state firms. He also found favor with party officials, including Xi, who was supportive of startups like Alibaba while he was Zhejiang party boss.80 Premier Wen Jiabao, during a 2010 visit to Alibaba’s Hangzhou headquarters, described himself as a “serious” student of Ma.81 Ma joined the party too, though his membership wasn’t widely known until the People’s Daily mentioned it in 2018—a revelation that spurred questions about what Ma would do if he, one day, had to choose between party mandates and corporate interests.82

Regulators had long wanted to rein in Ma. They believed Alibaba was engaging in consumer unfriendly and anti-competitive practices on its online-retail platforms, while Ant was applying user data to gain an unfair advantage over banks and hampering government efforts to monitor credit risks. But Ma and his businesses held their ground for years. When China’s market regulatory agency issued a report in 2015 saying many products sold on Alibaba’s Taobao platform were fake, substandard, banned, or they infringed on trademarks, the company threatened to file a complaint, while Ma flew to Beijing to meet with the agency chief, an episode documented by my Wall Street Journal colleagues. The regulator soon removed the report from its website and called it an internal memo, not an official document.83

Authorities also worried that Alibaba had accrued too much influence over China’s news and social media industries, and was trying to use that clout to reshape government policies. In 2020, when rumors about a senior Alibaba executive’s involvement in an extramarital affair swirled on Weibo, users complained that their posts about the purported scandal were being censored—a practice common for politically sensitive posts but unusual for celebrity gossip. Internet regulators later found that Alibaba had directed Weibo, in which the e-commerce giant held a roughly 30 percent stake, to suppress the rumors.84

Ma’s flashy style, once part of his appeal, also started grating on young Chinese who saw him as a symbol of rising inequality and capitalist excess. He earned ridicule for indulging in vanity projects, like a 2017 short film in which Ma played a kung-fu master alongside Chinese action-movie stars. When Ma defended the grueling work hours that permeate China’s tech sector, known as “996,” or 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, social media erupted with anger from young workers denouncing what they saw as exploitation.85

Ma also irked Beijing by behaving too much like an American entrepreneur, oozing braggadocio and acting dismissive of the government’s authority. He styled himself an informal ambassador for China, traveling to meet world leaders such as French President François Hollande at the Élysée Palace, U.S. President Barack Obama for a private White House lunch, and President-elect Donald Trump in New York.86 Alibaba’s in-house newsletters recounted such trips with language similar to what state media uses for Chinese leaders’ foreign visits. When Xi visited the U.S. in 2015, Ma was among a group of American and Chinese executives invited to a meeting with the Chinese leader, where participants each had three minutes to speak. Everyone kept to the allotted time except Ma, who spent ten minutes talking about how China sees the world and what Chinese companies could do to help improve U.S.-China ties. Xi was reportedly nonplussed by Ma’s display, and since then, he hasn’t allowed the businessman to speak before him in a group setting.87

An early sign of Ma’s shifting fortunes came in late 2018, when he wasn’t invited to a conference where Xi met fifty leading entrepreneurs—including top executives from tech giants like Tencent, search engine Baidu, and smartphone maker Xiaomi—to discuss the party’s policies toward the private sector. Commercial success, Xi told them, is secondary to the primary goal of boosting China’s technological security. Shortly after, Tencent CEO Pony Ma pledged to take on the mission of transforming China into an “internet power.”88 Jack Ma, meanwhile, seemed to be falling out of step with the party. His personal office at times sent suggestions to the top leadership through a party office that reported to Xi. Ma got a reply only occasionally. It was “like writing love letters to a loved one, but not getting many responses,” a person familiar with the correspondence told the Wall Street Journal.89

When the time came for Ma to reap the whirlwind, the party didn’t hold back. Authorities told Alibaba to slash its sprawling portfolio of media assets, so as to dilute the company’s influence over public opinion.90 Hupan University, an executive business school that Ma established in Hangzhou, was told to suspend enrollment for new students in 2021. “The government thinks Hupan has the potential to organize China’s top entrepreneurs to work towards a common goal set by Jack Ma instead of the Communist Party,” a person close to the school told the Financial Times.91 When Beijing published an honor roll of “model” contributors to Xi’s campaign to eliminate rural poverty, Alibaba joined about fifteen hundred groups and nearly two thousand individuals, including dozens of entrepreneurs, in receiving the accolade. Ma didn’t make the list.92 For many at Alibaba, the message couldn’t have been clearer: follow the party, not their founder.

Ma sought to make amends. Alibaba committed to spend 100 billion yuan, or about $15.7 billion at the time, by 2025 in support of Xi’s common prosperity campaign.93 Alibaba assuaged regulators’ concerns by allowing users to purchase items on some of its apps via a payment service run by its rival Tencent, while Ant delinked some financial products and services from its core payments platform.94 Ma stepped away from public view, swapping his jet-setting lifestyle for quieter moments playing golf, reading Taoist texts, and learning oil painting.95 By early 2023, he had relinquished control over Ant by giving up much of his voting rights over the fintech giant.

Some of his rivals also adapted to new realities. Pony Ma, the Tencent CEO, proposed tighter regulation of internet businesses like his own and volunteered to meet with antitrust authorities.96 E-commerce firm Pinduoduo’s founder left the company, saying he was going to pursue personal interests in life sciences.97 The founders of ByteDance, the tech firm that developed the TikTok short-video app, and online retail platform JD.com stepped down as chief executives of their respective companies, saying they would focus on longer-term strategy.98

Officials insist, in public remarks and private chatter, that the party neither needs nor wants to directly control private companies and their decision-making. What it requires of businesses is for them to conform with the party’s interests, or at the very least, do nothing inimical to Beijing’s agenda. For the most part, the party relies on Leninist tools to enforce corporate fealty. After the Politburo issued a 2015 directive demanding stronger party leadership over businesses and social groups, officials stepped up enforcement of regulations that mandated the creation of party cells in all organizations with three or more party members. Officially, the party’s goal was to reengage members in the private sector, who often joined for career reasons and tended to drift from politics over time. In practice, many executives sensed a campaign to realign corporate practices and decision-making with the party’s priorities.

Party cells in private companies serve as de facto human resource departments and listening posts, where members promote the party’s priorities, arrange social activities, and gauge worker sentiment. Officials insist that these groups don’t interfere in corporate decisions, but instead advise executives on government policies, resolve friction between management and staff, and help cultivate cohesive workforces. Party cells are “pioneers in business development, cradles of talent, and guarantors of business stability,” said Han Xu, a regulatory official overseeing party affairs in the private sector.99

Already omnipresent in SOEs, party cells have become de rigueur across private businesses. Some 68 percent of non-state enterprises had set up party cells by 2016, up from 54 percent four years earlier, while roughly 74,000 companies in China with full or partial foreign ownership—about 70 percent of the total—had set up party units, compared with 47,000 firms in 2011.100 Thousands of “party-building consultants” fanned out to “matchmake” between the party and businesses—helping firms set up party cells and recruit new members. As one official told a group of newly appointed consultants, they are the party’s “nerve endings” in private companies, who “ensure the party’s voice reaches the final meter.”101

Even major tech startups, long averse to mixing politics and business, started cheering the party on. Smartphone maker Xiaomi, whose executives boast a Western startup vibe and extol minimal hierarchy, established its own party committee in 2015 with about one hundred initial members, and within four years grew those ranks to more than 3,500 people, or more than 15 percent of its workforce.102 At Shenzhen Bay Venture Plaza, a state-backed industrial park that hosts tech startups, managers installed a sculpture featuring a hammer-and-sickle symbol with inscriptions that say, in Chinese and English: “Follow our party, start your business.”

Where entrepreneurs prove less obliging, the party often coerces them. After Xi launched his crackdown on organized crime in 2018, aimed at breaking up collusion between corrupt bureaucrats and mafia-like groups, some prominent industrialists embroiled in disputes with local governments were detained for alleged criminal wrongdoing and had their assets seized. While authorities insisted that these cases were handled lawfully, many within Chinese business circles sensed overreach by overzealous investigators chasing campaign quotas, or self-serving officials who wanted to boost state firms by undercutting private-sector competition.103

What makes entrepreneurs especially vulnerable to such tactics is that China’s private sector has long been clouded by the notion of “original sin,” or the suspicion that many businesses acquired assets and established themselves through illicit means. During the boom years of the 1990s and 2000s, the party struggled to develop a robust regulatory system that could police corporate conduct and protect property rights in a fair and consistent manner. Many companies took advantage of this legal murkiness, resorting to dubious practices—such as bribery, tax evasion, and loan-sharking—to boost their businesses. Others sought patrons in government who can provide deals and protection. Many officials condoned the shady dealings, and some even joined in, accepting bribes to rig tenders and shield companies from criminal probes. What Tsinghua University economist Bai Chong’en described as a “special deal” economy emerged, as local governments—chasing investments and faster growth—competed in dishing out preferential policies to favored private firms.

The question of how to deal with “original sin” is a perennial one.104 Many Chinese voice outrage over ill-gotten wealth, arguing that those responsible should be punished. Some believe the government should grant some clemency, such as a statute of limitations or tax amnesties, to give past transgressors a chance to turn fully legitimate. Even among entrepreneurs that now conduct business more scrupulously, their past still hangs over them like a Sword of Damocles. Should authorities decide to revisit their misdeeds, companies could face reputational damage, regulatory sanctions, and even criminal prosecution. As it was, Xi’s crackdown on organized crime offered incentives for pursuing such cases. Under pressure to deliver results, some officials appeared to build organized-crime probes against entrepreneurs by blurring lines between criminal syndicates and legitimate companies that engage in illegal behavior, according to defendants and lawyers involved in these cases.

Chinese law defines “underworld organizations” broadly. They are described as groups that have clear leadership and a “fairly large” and stable membership, seek economic benefit, repeatedly use violent means, cause severe economic and social harm, and often receive protection from corrupt officials. The problem, however, is that private companies also have an organized hierarchy, seek economic gain, and in some cases, collude with local governments and cause harm to local communities. As Ruan Qilin, a criminal-law professor and an adviser to China’s top procuratorial agency, explains, the main difference between an underworld group and a legitimate business lies in the former’s propensity for violence. It wouldn’t take much for investigators to package what some see as corporate wrongdoing into an organized-crime case.

Such concerns emerged in the public eye when Xi’s campaign against organized crime snared Zhang Dewu, a farming tycoon in the central province of Hubei. Born into a peasant family in 1963, Zhang started out selling poultry before setting up Xiangda Group in the early 2000s, eventually growing his animal husbandry business into a conglomerate with interests in chemicals and construction that for a time ranked among China’s top five hundred private enterprises.105 Officials in his home city of Yicheng routinely praised Xiangda as a top contributor to the local economy, while Zhang himself earned recognition from Beijing as a model industrialist.106

Zhang also had his brushes with the law. In 2001, he was detained for alleged involvement in organized crime and later sentenced to nine years’ jail for offenses that included provoking trouble, firearms possession, and tax evasion—though these convictions were struck down and a retrial acquitted Zhang on most charges.107

Authorities detained Zhang again in late 2019, eventually accusing him of running a violent crime ring that disrupted public order, rigged bids, and engaged in loan-sharking.108 Some of the allegations stemmed from a protest that Zhang arranged in 2016, when hundreds of his employees demonstrated in front of a local court to question a judicial ruling that went against his company.109 His lawyers said the allegations against him neither fit government definitions of organized crime nor involved serious violence. While acknowledging that some of Zhang’s employees used coercive methods to handle business disputes, the lawyers said these employees caused only minor injuries in one instance, and their actions didn’t meet the legal criteria of using routine violence to oppress and cause harm to the public.

Zhang’s daughter stepped in to run Xiangda but struggled to keep the business going, as employees demurred on making decisions and signing papers that they feared could implicate them in the case against their boss. In June 2021, more than eighteen months after police detained Zhang, his daughter made a dramatic plea: inviting the government to run the company and take over its assets. “It’s too bitter and too tough being a Chinese private entrepreneur,” Zhang Jianhang wrote in an open letter to provincial leaders, offering to donate Xiangda’s assets to the state and allow authorities to manage the firm. A government takeover, she said, would keep Xiangda afloat and ensure that its employees and partners “no longer live in fear everyday.”110

The letter sparked a furor on social media, where entrepreneurs, lawyers, and ordinary Chinese lamented what they saw as a deteriorating business climate. “The survival of private enterprises is becoming increasingly difficult,” Huang Yingsheng, a former judge, wrote in an online post that censors soon blocked. “I hope that the current situation, in which ‘entrepreneurs are either in jail or on their way to jail,’ can soon change!”111 Others were less optimistic. For decades, entrepreneurs in China “always thought that tomorrow will be better,” but such rosiness has now faded, the founder of a prominent technology company says. “We are all small-time businessmen in the eyes of government officials.”112

The week after Zhang Jianhang published her letter, the Yicheng municipal party chief visited Xiangda and said the government was committed to helping the company grow and succeed.113 But the elder Zhang’s legal woes didn’t go away. Authorities indicted Zhang Dewu for alleged wrongdoing that included “picking quarrels and provoking trouble,” loan sharking, bid rigging, and gathering people to assault state organs, though prosecutors didn’t proceed with organized-crime charges. In early 2022, a court handed Zhang a thirteen-year jail sentence, which was later reduced to eight and a half years on appeal.114 As of this writing, the Zhang family continued to control Xiangda.





TAMING BARBARIANS


AT THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY’S theme park in Shanghai, where cartoon mice and preening princesses prance around the Enchanted Storybook Castle, a merry band of Communists work hard to maintain the fantasy. The four hundred or so party members at the Shanghai Disney Resort do everything from running hotels to policing park security, while keeping their political affiliation invisible to visitors. Among colleagues, they showcase their socialist loyalties with pride, displaying hammer-and-sickle insignia on their desks and meeting spaces, even as they serve an icon of American capitalism.

State media extols the Shanghai Disney Resort’s Communist Party committee as a fruitful marriage of politics and business. Disney’s embrace of the party was crucial in securing Beijing’s approval for the $5.5 billion theme park, along with other compromises such as giving their Chinese partners more of the profits and a major role in running the resort.115 Disney has a minority stake in the resort, but owns 70 percent of the joint venture that runs it.116 The deal also included a guarantee for the joint venture’s right to set up party cells—a demand that Disney, according to its Chinese partner, the state-owned Shendi Group, didn’t initially understand but acceded to nonetheless.

When Shanghai Disney Resort celebrated its first anniversary in 2017, state media portrayed the party as a cornerstone of the theme park’s success. One report described the resort’s party committee as a “bridge of enchantment” between American and Chinese management. The committee, which uses a Disney.com email address, organizes social activities such as singing contests and arranges political seminars at a dedicated party activity center decorated with Mickey Mouse silhouettes. In-house newsletters praise party members as exemplary workers who do their utmost to serve guests and help colleagues.117 “At the most iconic Sino-foreign joint venture in China,” one state media report said, party members “have proved their worth with their actions, and they have shown the world with their hard work that, at all times, the party organization is an indestructible fighting fortress.”118

But for some Western companies, the compromises that they make to do business in China have become increasingly uncomfortable as Xi has tightened state control over the private sector. Some multinationals have found ways to accommodate the party’s presence while keeping them out of public view. Others worry that in-house party groups may try to influence business decisions, and struggle to decide how much party activities they can tolerate to remain in favor with Chinese authorities and business partners, as well as their own local staff. Recently, foreign firms have more often found themselves caught up in geopolitical spats, forced to choose between placating Chinese authorities and consumers and allaying political pressure in their home countries, where resentment against China has risen.

Some of the friction is more prosaic than ideological. Foreign executives tell me they have argued with Chinese counterparts over whether party members should be allowed to meet during work hours, conduct meetings on company premises, or be given time off and receive company funds to conduct party activities. Some foreign businesses worry that party operatives, over time, may gain influence over management decisions or create an alternative power center. Others complain that Chinese executives with party membership spend too much time on their political duties, or are trying to steer corporate decisions in line with Beijing’s priorities.119

Chinese officials bristle at Western business practices that impair party work. The Beijing Investment Promotion Bureau lamented that the foreign corporate norm of keeping staff salaries secret makes it harder to assess party dues, which are pegged to members’ wages. “Party cells at foreign firms face a special work environment,” said Xu Ying, a municipal party official in Beijing. “But the political leadership that party cells provide cannot be allowed to weaken.”120

Foreign executives say openly questioning the party’s initiatives would be corporate suicide in a key market, so most companies raise their concerns through business groups. In 2020, after the party issued guidelines on strengthening its links with private businesses, the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China warned that such efforts may force foreign firms to rethink their investments in China. By pushing companies to “incorporate more political calculus into their decisions, instead of just following market forces,” the party could “lead companies to reconsider who they partner with,” the chamber said.121

Some Western multinationals say their Chinese partners have pushed to amend their joint-venture agreements to enshrine formal roles for in-house party groups—a move foreign managers see as the thin end of the wedge. Executives at a major European manufacturer argued with cadres in the company after management tried to set limits on party activities. “We’re concerned that the party is pushing the envelope and creeping into the company,” one senior executive told me. The company held firm, he said, allowing just three party meetings a year on its premises, and only after business hours.122 At a 51:49 joint venture between Chinese state energy giant Sinopec and a European firm, promising young staff often went away for weeks to attend classes at a party academy, according to a former executive. “How would you feel if some of your best workers go away for party studies for a month?” he said. “But the Chinese managers were enthusiastic. They see it as a positive.”123

Even Disney has found itself wrongfooted by its Chinese partner at times, when Shendi went too far in playing up the American firm’s support for party activities. In 2017, Shendi publicized a “party building” meeting with a photograph showing the Shanghai Disney Resort’s vice president for public affairs, Murray King, seated beside the theme park’s deputy general manager and party chief. Shanghai’s official party newspaper, Jiefang Daily, quoted King as saying the resort’s best employees are mostly party members, and that its party cell helped ensure the theme park’s success and created value for shareholders. When the Wall Street Journal asked Disney about these reports, the company disputed some quotes attributed to King and said he was speaking at a media briefing arranged by Shendi, rather than a party meeting. What King actually said, according to Disney, was that while some resort employees are party members, Disney doesn’t make it a requirement. After I approached Shendi for comment, the party meeting photos disappeared from its website.124

Some Western firms have chosen to embrace the party’s presence. The Conference Board, a business research association with major U.S. and European brands among its members, advised clients to “know the politics in order to avoid the politics” and demonstrate their “contributions to China.” Party members at German engineering firm Bosch Rexroth’s Beijing office often spent their Saturdays studying Xi’s speeches and policies. French automaker Renault’s China joint venture praised its party cell for fostering workplace cohesion, and arranged lectures to teach new foreign staff about the party. The China arm of French cosmetics firm L’Oréal stocked party literature in its Shanghai staff cafeteria and encouraged party members to decorate their desks with stickers saying, “If there’s a problem, look for a party member.” Party activities create “positive energy and driving forces for the company’s healthy development,” a L’Oréal China executive said.125

But passive acceptance of the party isn’t enough. As gatekeepers of the world’s largest consumer market, Beijing increasingly called on foreign businesses to echo party narratives and accused uncompliant companies of “hurting the feelings of the Chinese people.” The political status of Taiwan, the island democracy which the party claims as Chinese territory, became a key sticking point after an independence-leaning president took office in Taipei in 2016. Chinese officials, media, and netizens denounced any suggestion that Taiwan is a sovereign state, and excoriated foreign airlines, hotel chains, and retailers that listed Taiwan as a country on their websites.126 Some companies buckled, relabeling the island as a province of China. Others devised workarounds, such as renaming their list of locations from “countries” to “territories,” to avoid being seen as caving to Chinese whims.127

Hong Kong, a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997, became a point of contention after anti-Beijing protests rocked the financial center in 2019. The National Basketball Association lost hundreds of millions in sponsorship dollars from China after the then general manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, tweeted his support for the protesters with an image showing the words: “Fight for Freedom. Stand With Hong Kong.” Though deleted, the post turned the Rockets, widely popular in China for fielding Chinese star Yao Ming from 2002 to 2011, into a target of online scorn and boycott threats in the NBA’s biggest international market.128 When Western governments blasted Beijing for imposing a national-security law on Hong Kong in 2020, foreign multinationals in the city faced pressure to take sides. London-based bank HSBC, which makes most of its profits in mainland China and Hong Kong, had a senior executive sign a petition supporting the security law and publicized his gesture on Chinese social media.129

Foreign companies have been buffeted by geopolitical headwinds time and again since Deng welcomed outside capital into China. After the U.S. and European governments sanctioned Beijing for its deadly crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Western executives grappled with how to abide by the restrictions while trying to resume business in the country. Japanese companies often faced outbursts of nationalist anger when bilateral tensions spiked over territorial disputes and Tokyo’s posture on wartime atrocities in China. Such troubles have grown more frequent and intense under Xi. His emphasis on national security, used to justify protectionist practices and demands for control over business data, grated on foreign firms.130 His calls for China’s economic self-sufficiency translated into policies less welcoming toward outside companies that are seen as less helpful to the country’s push to acquire high-end technologies. Western multinationals also face pressure from politicians, investors, and consumers at home to avoid complicity with China in rights abuses, such as the suppression of dissent in Hong Kong and the forced assimilation of Muslims in Xinjiang. Hewing to Western opinion would spark anger and threats of boycotts in China, while placating Beijing could incur reputational damage at home.

Some companies balked at these challenges, choosing to trim their China operations or withdraw entirely, citing mounting political risks and a tougher business climate. In 2019, Google confirmed it had scrapped plans to launch a censored search engine in China, after media revelations of the project spurred Western public backlash against the tech firm.131 Microsoft’s LinkedIn closed its China networking service in 2021 and replaced it with a job-board platform without social media features—a change it attributed to “a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in China.”132 Yahoo pulled out of the country just weeks later, citing similar reasons.133 Airbnb followed suit in 2022 after struggling to cope with local competition and China’s strict Covid lockdowns.134

Others tried accommodating Beijing. According to a Reuters report, Amazon.com Inc. complied with Chinese government requests to block customer ratings and reviews on its Chinese site after an anthology of Xi’s remarks marketed on the platform received a negative review.135 Amazon also teamed with a Chinese state propaganda agency to launch a bookselling portal, and gave Beijing information about an internet protocol address used by a fugitive Chinese businessman based in the U.S., the Reuters report said. “Ideological control and propaganda is the core of the toolkit for the communist party to achieve and maintain its success,” Reuters quoted an internal Amazon document as saying. “We are not making judgement on whether it is right or wrong.”136 Even so, the American company has struggled to compete with Chinese rivals in their home market, shutting down its China online store in 2019 and pulling its Kindle e-bookstore from the Chinese market.137

Foreign businesses also found themselves reckoning with China’s policies in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, as human rights watchdogs and Western governments called attention to the Communist Party’s efforts to forcibly assimilate Muslim minorities there. Xinjiang plays a sizable role in global supply chains, producing raw materials like cotton used by major clothing brands and nearly half of the world’s supply of polysilicon—a key ingredient in making solar panels.138 Some foreign firms, such as German automaker Volkswagen, have production plants in Xinjiang. The region has also been a major procurer of advanced American technology, from semiconductors to genetic-sequencing gear, that local authorities use to surveil ethnic minorities and suppress dissent.139 Activists and academics tracked down government documents and eyewitness accounts suggesting that a state-run employment program supplying workers—including former detainees at internment camps—to factories in Xinjiang and around the country amounts to forced labor.

Some multinationals echoed Beijing’s narratives to protect their interests in Xinjiang. During a 2019 interview, then Volkswagen CEO Herbert Diess said he was “not aware” of any detention camps in Xinjiang—a remark critics denounced as either a lie or culpable ignorance on the part of a company that used forced labor during the Third Reich.140 Volkswagen, which at the time was making about 40 percent of its sales and half its profits in China, also resisted calls to close its Xinjiang plant, which started operations in 2013, saying the forced-labor issue didn’t arise, because the company directly employed its workers there.141 Electric car maker Tesla Inc., whose CEO Elon Musk often praised China in meetings with senior Chinese officials, announced a new showroom in Urumqi on the last day of 2021, promising to “launch Xinjiang on its electric journey” and posting photos from the opening ceremony that featured placards reading “Tesla (heart) Xinjiang.”142

Deviating from Beijing’s narratives on Xinjiang can be costly. In early 2021, the world’s largest clothing brand, Hennes & Mauritz’s H&M, was battered in China after social media users called attention to a statement issued the previous year expressing concern about reports of forced labor and discrimination against ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. In the statement, the Swedish fast-fashion brand said it prohibited forced labor in its supply chain and didn’t source products from Xinjiang.143 State media accused H&M of smearing China, online influencers urged a boycott, its Chinese brand ambassadors cut ties, and major e-commerce platforms blocked searches for the company. The furor also engulfed other major brands like Nike and Adidas, whose membership in the Better Cotton Initiative, a nonprofit that certifies farms on sustainability standards, became a source of controversy when Chinese netizens dug up the group’s 2020 decision to suspend licensing of producers in Xinjiang. Chinese brands, meanwhile, enjoyed a surge in sneaker and sportswear sales in China that, in some cases, helped them outperform Western apparel giants.144

The government had a hand in stoking outrage. Weeks before consumer anger engulfed H&M, officials from the Chinese foreign ministry and the party’s propaganda department met with expert advisers to discuss ways to fight back against Western narratives on Xinjiang.145 Some said Beijing should refute every false story or statement. Others suggested that the pushback should come from the public and industry, rather than the government.146 Attacks against H&M and other Western brands unfolded in line with the latter recommendations. According to an analysis by Doublethink Lab, a Taipei-based nonprofit that studies Chinese disinformation operations, the campaign began in March 2021 when a relatively obscure Weibo influencer published screenshots of the H&M statement on Xinjiang cotton and suggested that he would boycott the company.147 Hours later, the Communist Youth League’s official Weibo account republished those screenshots with the caption: “Spreading rumors to boycott Xinjiang cotton while trying to make money in China? Wishful thinking!” Outrage ensued online, and propaganda officials in Beijing quietly celebrated what they saw as a successful counterblow against Western criticism.148

Spiraling tensions between China and the West heaped more pressure on multinationals trying to bridge both sides of the geopolitical divide. In the summer of 2021, Beijing fast-tracked an anti–foreign sanctions law into force without public consultation, creating new legal tools for punishing companies whose home governments were deemed to be harming Chinese interests. Washington doubled down with new legislation in December that year, banning imports from Xinjiang over concerns about the use of forced labor in the region.149 On the day the U.S. Senate passed the law, Intel Corporation published a letter to suppliers asking them to avoid using any labor or sourcing any goods and services from Xinjiang.150 Though this guidance changed little from what Intel had previously said, Chinese social media lit up with angry users accusing the chip maker of smearing their country. Intel, which counted China as its largest market by revenue, soon revised the letter to remove direct references to Xinjiang, saying the original document had been written to comply with U.S. law and wasn’t an expression of the company’s position on Xinjiang.151

Western multinationals voiced fears that they might become sacrificial pawns in a geopolitical struggle.
