Journalism is a collective enterprise. This book is the culmination of the goodwill and generosity of countless people whom I’ve encountered over my years as a foreign correspondent in China. Political sensitivities and professional discretion prevent me from openly thanking many of them, but I hope they can take some satisfaction from seeing their ideas, insights, and tips appear across these pages.

Jude Blanchette deserves immense credit as the book’s most energetic advocate, having first seeded the idea over lunch in Beijing back in 2017. He assured me that I had a compelling story to tell, guided me through the groundwork of crafting a proposal, critiqued my early drafts, and reminded me that “it takes a village to write a book.” If I am the village chief in this analogy, then he has been a sterling deputy.

I am greatly indebted to my colleagues and mentors at the Wall Street Journal, particularly the denizens of the China bureau, now spread across Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Taipei, Tokyo, Seoul, Singapore, Washington, and New York. They are the newsroom giants whose shoulders I stand on. Charles Hutzler took a chance in bringing me to Beijing and related the many wisdoms and war stories he accrued over more than two decades in China. The late, great Carlos Tejada was a patient editor and gregarious presence in the bureau. Josh Chin, Liza Lin, and Te-Ping Chen supplied copious advice on how to tackle the vagaries of book-writing. Keith Zhai has been a phenomenal reporting partner, offering a sounding board, sharing contacts, and imparting his vast knowledge on Chinese politics. Kersten Zhang, who navigated the Chinese bureaucracy with an easy charm like no other journalist I know could, was ever so kind when I needed help dealing with officials or eliciting responses from reluctant sources, some of whom are cited in this book. Patrick Barta never failed to distil my arguments and liven up my copy. P. R. Venkat, one of the most resourceful and generous colleagues I’ve had, taught me many valuable lessons about work and life. Jonathan Cheng and Andrew Dowell offered unflinching support throughout this project.

My deepest thanks goes to the following people, who helped review drafts, correct my misapprehensions, and sharpen my arguments: Ryan Manuel, Yufan Huang, Jeff Khoo, Timothy Cheek, Mark C. Elliott, Max Oidtmann, Joseph Torigian, Changhao Wei, Donald Clarke, Susan Finder, Donald Low, Andrew Collier, Philip Wen, Yang Jie, Yoko Kubota, Lingling Wei, Eva Xiao, James T. Areddy, Liyan Qi, Chao Deng, Joyu Wang, and Clement Tan. I am very grateful as well for the advice and encouragement offered by Gerry Shih, Eva Dou, Yuanjie Zheng, Lun Tian Yew, Jun Mai, Pei Li, Hallie Gu, Sarah Chen, Peidong Sun, Shibani Mahtani, Timothy McLaughlin, Newley Purnell, Stella Xie, Wenxin Fan, Till Lembke, and Nick Marro.

My agent, Howard Yoon, of Ross Yoon Agency, grasped the book’s potential immediately, and shepherded this rookie author painlessly through the pitching process. Ben Loehnen of Avid Reader Press edited the manuscript with sharpness and enthusiasm, and managed the production with immense patience.

Lastly, I owe immeasurable gratitude to my family. My late father, who toiled ceaselessly to support our family before his faculties faded; my indefatigable mother, whose quiet sacrifices allowed me to pursue my passions; and my brother and sister, who constantly remind me there’s more to life than work. Claire Soon, my wife and best friend, walked with me on every step in this project, reading my manuscript, indulging my foibles, and assuring me that I have the wherewithal to see things through. I dedicate this book to them.
