The historical past is a rich repository of analogies that shape perceptions and guide public policy decisions. Those analogies are especially influential in crises, when there is no time for reflection. They are particularly potent when so-called experts are unable to agree on a framework for careful analytic reasoning. They carry the most weight when there is a close correspondence between current events and an earlier historical episode. And they resonate most powerfully when an episode is a defining moment for a country and a society.

For President Harry S. Truman, in deciding whether to intervene in Korea, that historical moment was Munich. For policy makers confronted in 2008– 09 with the most serious financial crisis in eighty years, that moment was the Great Depression. Given the close correspondence between the events of 2008–09 and the 1930s, the earlier episode, or more precisely the lessons of the episode as distilled by economists and historians, powerfully shaped perceptions and reactions.

Policy makers, according to this distillation, should respond swiftly and forcefully to incipient financial distress. This means injecting liquidity into financial markets to prevent problems from spreading further. It means sorting out insolvent banks from those that are illiquid, while continuing to extend emergency liquidity to the latter but closing down or recapitalizing the former, in this way restoring confidence and allowing the financial system to start functioning again.

But even though this monetary and financial triage may prevent financial distress from deepening, it will not undo the damage already done. Given the disruption to financial markets, it will not be enough to prevent a serious 分页。。。recession. It will not be enough to get the economy moving again if heightened risk aversion creates a reluctance to borrow and lend. In such circumstances, it will be necessary to increase public spending to offset the decline in private spending. This emergency response should be forceful, but it should also be temporary. It should be wound down when private spending recovers, in order to prevent debts from spiraling out of control.

Help, in the form of extending the duration of unemployment benefits, augmenting provision of food stamps and expanding access to social services, should meanwhile be provided to the unemployed casualties of the crisis. Helping these less fortunate members of society is fair and just insofar as their suffering results from the malfunctioning of a system that operates disproportionately to the benefit of others. But such help is also required to maintain broad support for prevailing economic and political processes.

Last but not least, the flawed monetary, fiscal, financial, and social policies that allowed the crisis to develop in the first place should be fixed through comprehensive reforms put in place before the sense of urgency has passed.

Such were the lessons of the Great Depression as distilled by economic and historical scholars. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz made the case for forceful central bank action to prevent banking crises, deflation, and depression in a book hailed as one of the most important works of twentieth-century economic history. John Maynard Keynes made the case for public spending to counter depressed economic conditions in one of the most influential books in all of economics. Karl Polanyi made the case for social and regulatory reform in a book published to great acclaim in 1944.1 Those making consequential decisions in 2007–08 did not all have firsthand knowledge of these authors. But they were aware of their arguments, given how their conclusions were passed down through the generations and had come to constitute a standard historical narrative.

Policy makers in the United States and other countries, their actions informed by this narrative, responded quickly and forcefully to events. Central banks cut interest rates and flooded financial markets with liquidity. Governments unfurled front-loaded programs of fiscal stimulus. Although efforts to recapitalize the banks were more tentative, they were enough. Collapse of the monetary and financial system was averted. Support for democracy and the market economy did not crumble. This at least was no Great Depression.

The paradox is that we failed to do better. Unemployment in the advanced economies still rose to double-digit levels, not as high as in the Great Depression but higher than in normal recessions, and higher than anticipated by those taught to believe that economic science had cracked the problem of avoiding a Depression-like slump. Financial distress was more acute than expected by those taught to believe that central banks and regulators had learned how to prevent a 1930s-style crisis. Recovery was marred by slow growth, high unemployment, and a falling rate of labor force participation. It remained sluggish for longer than could be explained by the need for firms and households to work down excessive debts and banks to repair damaged balance sheets, alone.

It can be argued that high unemployment and deep recession are unavoidable in the wake of a financial crisis, appropriate policy response or not. But this observation, even if correct, only pushes the problem back another step. The paradox then is that we failed to anticipate, much less prepare for, the possibility of this crisis.

Ironically, the roots of this failure lay in the same progressive narrative of the Great Depression. Entirely correctible flaws of collective decision making, this narrative explained, were responsible for the inability of contemporaries to appreciate the risks to stability in the 1920s, and then for their failure to deal effectively with the consequences in the 1930s. Modern-day policy makers learned from the mistakes of their predecessors. Scientific central banking informed by a rigorous framework of inflation targeting reduced economic and financial volatility and prevented serious imbalances. Advances in supervision and regulation limited financial excesses. Deposit insurance eliminated bank runs and financial panics. The dominant narrative of the Great Depression, that it was caused by avoidable policy failures, was itself conducive to the belief that those failures could be—and had been—corrected. It followed that no comparable crisis was possible now.

This belief, we now know, was dreadfully wrong. The economic and financial instability of the 1920s and 1930s may have been heavily associated with inflation and deflation, problems that inflation targeting, the twentyfirst-century version of Friedman and Schwartz’s stable money growth rule, could plausibly claim to have solved. But this did not mean other risks to stability were eliminated. To the contrary, the long period of economic stability, the Great Moderation, encouraged investors to take on additional risk. The eighty years since the advanced economies last experienced an equally serious crisis allowed them to ignore the consequences. Time dampened awareness that financial markets are unstable. Market participants are continuously innovating, sometimes in the effort to better serve their customers but other times to evade regulations put in place in response to earlier problems. The regulatory bloodhounds are unable to keep pace with the well-fed private-sector greyhounds. The result is a widening gap between actual regulation and what appears, with hindsight, as best regulatory practice. All this suggests that the longer the period of stability persists, the greater the risks. But this is not the perception while the party is underway. In addition, a long period of stability born of good policy or good luck empowers those inclined to argue that regulation is too strict. A regulatory response to the Great Depression, which produced a tightly cosseted financial system and an extended period of stability, thus contained the seeds of its own destruction. Financiers could argue that since they had learned to better manage risk, capital and liquidity requirements for financial institutions could be relaxed. Restrictions on cross-selling financial products could be removed. The heavy hand laid on financial markets in the 1930s could give way to light-touch regulation. The instability of financial markets and hence the dangers of light-touch regulation should have been another lesson of the Great Depression as distilled by economic and historical scholars. This view existed as well, but it resided mainly on the fringes of economics.

Why it remained out of the mainstream is worth pondering further. If such powerful lessons for how policy makers should respond to a crisis were remembered, how could other equally powerful lessons about what could cause it be forgotten?

Part of the answer is that historians always did a better job of describing the fateful decisions that transformed the recession of 1929 into the Great Depression of the 1930s than of understanding the origins of the recession itself. Explanations of the onset of the crisis were the least systematic and satisfactory part of the historical narrative. Lessons about what can cause a crisis and how to avoid one were less powerful because the corresponding history was less well developed and less effectively distilled.

In addition, recent experience reminds us that the causes of crises are not so simple and, consequently, not so readily identified and avoided. Flawed conceptual frameworks and wrongheaded policies there were in abundance, but the Great Depression involved more. We now appreciate how policy makers in the 1920s and 1930s were forced to take decisions on the basis of partial information about the state of the economy, just as the Federal Reserve didn’t know how rapidly conditions were deteriorating at the end of 2007 and President Obama’s economists didn’t know how fast the economy was shrinking in 2009. The problem wasn’t simply that they didn’t know how to react to a certain set of conditions. It is that they didn’t know the conditions. A crisis is a time when the pace of events seems to accelerate and when information is especially incomplete. Having lived through such a moment in 2008–09, we better appreciate how a similar moment must have felt in 1929.

This is just one example of how the Great Recession will change how we understand the Great Depression. We now better appreciate the tendency to take credit for an extended period of stability, extrapolate that stability into the future, and let our guard down. We better understand the inclination to offer ex post rationalizations for large and unsustainable lending flows. We better understand the temptation to reduce the art of economic policy making to a simple rule, whether it is that the central bank should focus on a rate of inflation of 2 percent, as recommended by the tenets of inflation targeting, or that it should provide only as much credit as is required by the legitimate needs of business, following the dictates of the real bills doctrine. We better understand the anger spawned by bailouts of fat-cat bankers and how this complicates the extension of public support for troubled banks. We better appreciate how viewing the future through the lens of the past can distort as well as illuminate—how Europeans starting in 2010 could remain fixated on the risk of 1920s-style inflation when deflation was the real and present danger, or how US policy makers could remain preoccupied by excessive risk taking after 1929 when in fact a dearth of risk taking was holding back the economy. We better understand the reluctance of central bankers, sensitive to political criticism, to do more to promote recovery. And we better understand the instincts that led governments in the midst of a crisis to cut spending prematurely.

Finally, we better appreciate that economic analysis and advice are not enough. Policies still have to be implemented. And here deeply held political ideologies and agendas stand in the way. These are by no means new themes in histories of the Great Depression. But recent events will cast them in a more prominent light.

The progressive narrative—that advances in risk management and regulation had eliminated the danger of a 1930s-style financial crisis—similarly rested on a particular, historically informed vision of the risks. The crisis of the 1930s, in the standard narrative, resulted from runs on banks that governments and central banks did too little to prevent and whose effects they did too little to contain. But this focus on the banks caused twenty-first-century policy makers to miss the growing importance of the nonbank financial sector of hedge funds, money market funds, and special purpose vehicles. It caused them to miss the importance of derivative securities and other nonbank financial claims. This neglect was especially consequential in the United States, where, by the early twenty-first century, nonbank sources had come to provide more than two-thirds of credit to the nonfinancial private sector. But it was more general.

This shift had profound if unappreciated consequences. Federal deposit insurance did nothing to enhance confidence in money market mutual funds, whose shareholders were now as prone to run as bank depositors in the 1930s. Capital requirements for banks did nothing to deter excessive risk taking or provide a buffer against losses when the risky assets were held by the offshore arms of insurance companies, like AIG Financial Products. But the bank-focused crisis of the 1930s and the enduring influence of that narrative encouraged policy makers to overlook this change in the locus of risks.

In Europe, where the nonbank financial sector furnished only 30 percent of credit to households and firms, the story was different. There it was still about the banks. The financial system had long been more bank-based in Europe than in the United States. Now, as memories of the banking crises of the 1930s faded and deregulationist forces gained traction, it was the banks that benefited disproportionately in country after country. The Creditanstalt crisis, in which the failure of a bank that supplied half of all credit to the Austrian economy triggered the collapse of Central Europe’s financial system, might have served as a cautionary tale. But not all European countries shared such histories. And banking policy, in any case, now was made at the European level. Even in countries that did share such a history, memories of it were lost in the din, overwhelmed by arguments about the efficiency advantages of megabanks and advances in scientific risk management.

In addition, some countries like Britain, fortunate to have been spared a banking crisis in the 1930s, were less than alert to the need for the central bank to act as a lender of last resort. Not having experienced a bank run in 150 years, they provided only limited deposit insurance. The result was the first bank run in 150 years.

The single greatest failure to learn appropriate lessons from this earlier history was surely the decision to adopt the euro. The 1920s and 1930s illustrated nothing better than the dangers of tying a diverse set of countries to a single monetary policy. Experience under the interwar gold standard highlighted the tendency for large amounts of capital to flow from countries where interest rates were low to where they were high, and the destabilizing consequences that would follow when those flows came to a stop. It highlighted the economic pain and political turmoil that would result when the only available response was austerity. That history should have given European leaders pause before moving ahead with the euro.

This failure is a reminder that there does not in general exist a single historical narrative, but several. History is contested. One narrative portrayed the fixed exchange rates of the 1920s gold standard as the problem; another instead indicted the unstable exchange rates of the 1930s as a source of disruptive beggar-thy-neighbor policies.2 This second interpretation resonated with recent European experience, given how disruptive exchange rate changes, as recently as 1992–93, had thrown a wrench into the gears of European integration. Many will now argue that this was a questionable reading of the 1930s. In the event, it led to the questionable decision to move to the euro, with unquestionably disastrous consequences. In the end, the Europeans did just enough to prevent the collapse of their monetary system. Like the Americans, they did just enough to avoid another Great Depression. But their very achievement weakened the incentive to do more. The monetary and financial system not having collapsed as completely as in the 1930s and the economic consequences being less dire, the urgency of radical reform was less. Financial interests spared damage on the scale of the 1930s were better able to mobilize in opposition to radical reform. Creditor countries were able to mobilize in opposition to proposals for pooling the debts of the monetary union partners and moving forthwith to banking union. Social policy reform was similarly less far-reaching because social distress was less.

Moreover, this policy success, such as it was, allowed governments and central banks to heed the call to return to normal policies as soon as the emergency passed. Unfortunately, the return to normal policies preceded the return to normal conditions. Under normal conditions the expansion of central bank balance sheets would have ignited inflation. The large budget deficits of the American and British governments would have caused interest rates to spike. That these consequences did not now follow should have made clear that economic conditions were still far from normal. But this did nothing to diminish the intensity of the call for governments to balance their budgets sooner rather than later.

As governments scaled back their spending, central bankers, concerned by the continued weakness of the economy, felt compelled to do more. But if unelected technocrats with narrow mandates were one thing, unelected technocrats with sweeping powers were another. Anxiety over their unprecedented interventions was shared by the central bankers themselves. The policies were unconventional, and central bankers are nothing if not conventional. Inflation aversion, the most deeply held convention of all, rendered moot the idea of raising the inflation target as a way of bringing down the cost of borrowing in this exceptional slump. Historical memories of the 1970s, when inflation had been allowed to run out of control, were more immediate for many of the central bankers on the Federal Open Market Committee than distant memories of deflation in the 1930s. Those more immediate memories caused them to hesitate to turn to unconventional policies even when deflation became the immediate threat.

Moreover, the longer unconventional policies persisted, the more political criticism they invited. Central bankers concerned to protect their independence grew more anxious still to return to conventional policies. The reluctance of twenty-first-century central banks to do more brought to light another lesson of the Great Depression, namely that central banks doing too little to support economic growth can also see their independence compromised and be stripped of their powers. But prior to recent experience, which highlighted this risk, this observation was not part of the conventional narrative.

Then there was the worry that low interest rates were encouraging investors to move into riskier assets. Policy, in this view, was only setting the stage for another bubble and another crash. This was of course the same fear that had prevented the authorities from responding more forcefully in the 1930s. Viewing the world through a historical mirror, they were unable to recognize that the problem in the 1930s was deflation rather than inflation. It was too little risk taking, not too much. Five years after Lehman Brothers, it was not hard to see the same funhouse mirror at work.

The concern with moral hazard was real, albeit more real for some policy makers than others. They worried about the consequences of creating expectations that everyone would be bailed out. But the concern was also political. Bailouts were politically contentious. Criticism fed the desire to find a bank that could be made an example, whether Lehman Brothers in 2008 or Union Guardian Trust in 1933.

The European version of this moral hazard argument was that too much central bank support for the prices of government bonds and even for economic growth would weaken the pressure on governments. Politicians and their constituents had to feel pain in order to appreciate the urgency of structural reform and fiscal consolidation. This problem was one of moral hazard, but also of moralism. The euro crisis, seen from Frankfurt and Berlin, was caused by feckless Southern Europeans. The subprime crisis that rendered Europe so vulnerable was caused by reckless Americans. The miscreants needed to suffer in order to mend their ways. The instincts that informed Andrew Mellon’s policies of liquidationism are easy to criticize, and they have come in for much criticism from historical scholars. Our own experience suggests they are universal human instincts. They are not easily suppressed.

This tendency to frame the crisis in moralistic terms did not make cooperation in countering it any easier. The historical narrative that governments and central banks, working at cross purposes, made things worse in the 1930s inspired the effort in 2008–09 to coordinate monetary and fiscal policies and shun protectionist responses. But once the emergency passed, sustaining cooperation became harder. As fatigue set in, coordination gave way to finger pointing. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble criticized the Federal Reserve for pushing down the dollar, deriding its policies as “clueless.” US President Obama cast not-so-veiled aspersions at the Europeans for not moving faster to fix their banks. In this light, the failure of governments and central banks to mount a cooperative response to the European financial crisis in 1931 and then to the global economic crisis in 1933 becomes easier to understand. Nowhere was the finger pointing worse, this time, than in Europe, where the Northern European narrative that set industrious Germans against spendthrift Greeks had as its Southern European counterpart an account that set ill-starred Greeks against unsympathetic Germans. This was not a framing that made it easy to extend foreign assistance, or even to accept it. It was not conducive to debt mutualization or debt forgiveness. A balanced analysis would have observed that for every reckless borrower there is a reckless lender. It would have acknowledged that it was easier for one country to export its way out of trouble than for every Southern European country to do so. It was easier to conjure up an export miracle with the support of an accommodating monetary policy and a weak euro, as in Germany in the early 2000s, than now that the opposite conditions prevailed. These same conclusions followed from the contrast between the 1920s, when France, with an undervalued currency, enjoyed an export boom, and the 1930s, when a depressed Europe was unable to collectively export its way out of a slump. But given how the crisis was framed, these implications were now lost on the French government and, more importantly, the German.

This more balanced analysis would have also conceded that no country is prepared to bail out a troubled neighbor without attaching conditions and putting in place mechanisms to ensure it is repaid. But a moralistic framing of the crisis that pitted the virtuous against the unprincipled was not conducive to this balanced view. It did not incline the lenders to propose reasonable conditions or borrowers to accept them. Successful countries could not resist the conclusion that their success derived from their virtue and that, to succeed, other countries only had to develop like-minded virtue. Unsuccessful countries were led to believe that their more successful neighbors took satisfaction in their plight.

Finally, that policy makers did just enough to prevent another Great Depression weakened the incentive to think deeply about causes. Having avoided financial collapse, it was still possible to defend America’s banking and financial system and Europe’s monetary union as the worst alternatives except for all the others (to paraphrase Winston Churchill on democracy). As a result, there was little discussion of executive compensation practices, in the financial sector and generally, and their implications for financial stability. In the wake of the crisis, there was the short-lived Occupy Movement, which questioned the merits of financialization and warned of growing inequality. But there was no sustained discussion of the roots of these phenomena or their consequences.3 Inequality reflected the failure of society to provide the majority of its members with the education and training needed for a world of global competition. It reflected technical change that made it easier to substitute robots for workers. There was little willingness to address these problems or to acknowledge that the disappointing recovery from the crisis reflected not just headwinds from deleveraging but also a long period of underinvestment in infrastructure, basic research, and education.

Addressing these problems would have required not a quick and temporary stimulus but sustained national and international strategies for investing in infrastructure, education, and research. It would have required mobilizing the necessary resources. It would have required hard thinking about how to ensure that the resources so mobilized were deployed productively. It would have meant pondering what kind of financial sector was needed to best support the growth of the nonfinancial economy and how to structure regulation to produce it.

In many cases, addressing these problems would have required more government, not less. This was the response to the Great Depression, but it was not the response now. The irony was that policy makers, by preventing the kind of depression that brought about the New Deal, discouraged hard thinking on the role of government.

Finally, the fact that policy makers did just enough to prevent another Great Depression meant that too little was done to make the world a safer financial place. Although banks are now subject to modestly higher capital and liquidity requirements, modestly is the operative word. Big banks are required to write living wills, and the Dodd-Frank Act in the United States includes a procedure for orderly liquidation of large financial institutions. But it is unclear whether those wills and liquidation procedures are actually to be used, given fears of exciting the markets. Little that is meaningful has been done about the problem of too-big-to-fail. That another Great Depression was avoided weakened the argument for more radical changes and allowed the banks to regroup.

Similarly, averting the worst allowed money market mutual funds and insurance companies to mobilize the lobbyists. Insurance companies, other than Prudential Financial and the now notorious AIG, were able to avoid being designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. The credit-rating agencies, legislative handwaving aside, were able to escape significant regulation and reform.

Likewise, although there is now a Volcker Rule to limit proprietary trading by commercial banks, it is riddled with exceptions, given that the banks, spared a 1930s-style crisis, were not inclined to divest their securities business. Transactions in derivative securities have been moved into clearinghouses, but this only concentrates risk rather than removing it. The Europeans, having avoided their own Great Depression, find it hard to overcome the political obstacles to creating a meaningful banking union. They find it hard to agree on conditions under which their emergency rescue fund can lend and their central bank can backstop financial markets. The crisis created a sense of urgency, but not urgency sufficient to overcome these problems.

Thus, the very success with which policy makers limited the damage from the worst financial crisis in eighty years means we are likely to see another such crisis in less than eighty years.

ACK NOW L ED GM ENTS

The first time I lectured at UC Berkeley on the Great Depression was on October 19, 1987. As those whose memories extend back that far will recall, this was before the World Wide Web. Since it was my first semester at Cal, the morning was spent fine-tuning the lecture, or more precisely the overheads, which focused on the Great Crash of 1929. As we exited the classroom, my new colleague and co-instructor Jan deVries commented, “Nice lecture. Did you hear that the Dow Jones fell by 508 points today?” At 1987 metrics, that was 23 percent, making it the largest one-day decline in stock market history, a record that still stands (one hesitates to write). October 28, 1929, one of the subjects of my lecture, now came in as a distant second, at 13 percent.

What followed—quick and ample provision of liquidity by a Federal Reserve headed by a brand-new chairman named Alan Greenspan—succeeded in averting a serious recession, and indeed prevented an economic slowdown of any magnitude. This appeared to confirm a central tenet of my lecture, namely that anything remotely resembling the Great Depression was no longer possible thanks to the lessons drawn from that earlier historical episode by the likes of Chairman Greenspan. Nor was anything resembling the Great Depression possible owing to other changes to the economy in the course of the twentieth century, such as the shift from relatively volatile manufacturing industry to a stabler service sector, the growth of government and its automatic fiscal stabilizers, and of course advances in financial management.

The Great Recession of 2008–09 is an overdue reminder that this conventional wisdom, taught to generations of students, was both right and wrong. It was right in the sense that central bankers had indeed learned lessons from history about how to respond to financial distress, enabling them 分页。。。to prevent a recession following the stock market crash in 1987. But it was wrong in that other changes to the economy had not, in fact, removed the risk of Great Depression–like event, whose causes entailed much more than the ups and downs of the stock market. It overlooked how financial markets and institutions responded to earlier changes in financial regulation. It neglected how investors adapted to the long period of economic stability engineered by, among others, that selfsame Alan Greenspan. It paid no heed to the possibility that, emergency injections of liquidity into financial markets notwithstanding, policy makers might take other steps that heightened the risk of a catastrophic economic and financial event. Most important, it neglected the primacy of politics, overlooking the tendency to take key decisions on the basis of political considerations rather than economic logic—a lesson of the Great Depression that, no doubt, will now be better remembered. The experience of the intervening period convinced us, collectively, that the Great Depression should be thought of as history. Recent experience is a reminder that this history is very much alive.

It is also a history that, again for better or worse, I have been writing for many years. The treatment here differs from that in my 1992 book by focusing equally on the United States and Europe, the advanced economies on which the Great Depression and even more the recent crisis centered, whereas that earlier book concentrated mainly on Europe. It differs by highlighting individuals as well as institutions as carriers of ideas and makers of policy. It differs most obviously by emphasizing the parallels, and where appropriate the differences, between 1929–1933 and 2008–09, and by explaining how distilled wisdom about the Great Depression shaped perceptions and responses to the Great Recession, and, equally, how the experience of the Great Recession will reshape how we think about the Great Depression.

Producing a book is a collective effort, as every author knows, and I am deeply grateful to all those who contributed to the production of this one. My thinking owes much to the Berkeley colleagues with whom I have co-taught that graduate class in economic history in the course of many years: Jan deVries, Christina Romer, and Brad DeLong. It owes much to colleagues with whom I have written on aspects of the Great Depression: Olivier Accominotti, Muge Adalet, Miguel Almuna, Michael Bordo, Alec Cairncross, Marc Flandreau, Richard Grossman, Tim Hatton, Doug Irwin, Kris Mitchener, Kevin O’Rourke, Richard Portes, Gisela Rua, Jeffrey Sachs, Peter Temin, and Charles Wyplosz. Certain of these collaborations go back more than thirty-five years, while others are so recent as to be not yet published. Some of these authors have gone on to bigger and better things, while others remain stuck, as I do, in the Great Depression. All of them have profoundly influenced my thinking. For comments on portions of the manuscript and help with sources, I am grateful to Alan Blinder, Paul Blustein, Sigrun Davíðsdóttir, Sebastian Edwards, Price Fishback, Mariko Hatase, Hilmar Hilmarsson, Philip Lane, Ashoka Mody, Kenneth Mouré, Kevin O’Rourke, Jonathan Portes, Richard Portes, Jonathan Rose, Kenneth Snowden, Shinji Takagi, and Eugene White. If the Great Depression and the 2008–09 crisis had a positive aspect, it was in creating this dedicated band of scholars preoccupied by the two periods and the questions they raise. In Berkeley, Erik Johnson provided indispensable help by checking names, dates, facts, and figures and, most important, challenging my interpretations; all remaining problems, to be clear, are mine, not his or anyone else’s. My editors promised me an exceptional copy editor, and in Thomas Finnegan they delivered. Again at Berkeley, the invaluable Cheryl Applewood helped further with editing while keeping my office running and my sanity more or less intact.

I have benefited greatly from substantive and stylistic guidance from my unparalleled editor at Oxford University Press, Dave McBride, and my equally unparalleled agent, Andrew Wylie. This is not the first time the three of us have worked together, nor, hopefully, will it be the last.

This one, too, is for Michelle.

April 2014 Introduction 1. The Basel Accord was negotiated by the Basel Committee on Banking

Supervision. Made up of representatives of the central banks and financial regulators of leading countries, its secretariat is housed at the Bank for International

Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. The first accord, “Basel I,” dated from 1988, the second, “Basel II,” from 2004. 2. This concern was reinforced by the terminology, which encouraged the notion that morality or ethics was involved. As Dembe and Boden (2000) explain, the eighteenth-century mathematicians who helped originate the term in fact used “moral” to mean subjective or intuitive, not virtuous or upright. 3. This was the conclusion made famous by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009a). 4. The cuts in question were to be implemented over ten years. 5. In the case of a permanent increase in deficit spending, households reduce their spending one for one. The literature refers to these as models of “Ricardian

Equivalence” (in which government deficits and surpluses and private-sector surpluses and deficits are equivalent and offsetting), an idea that goes back to the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century political economist David

Ricardo. 6. In a Ricardian model, a permanent increase in government spending will be offset by a commensurate increase in taxes over time and a one-for-one reduction in private spending, as noted above. But a temporary increase in government spending will require a smaller increase in taxes in each period to service and retire the debt and therefore a less-than-one-for-one reduction in private spending when the stimulus takes place. 7. This was the view of the so-called Ordoliberal School, which developed after

World War II (Dullien and Guérot 2012). 分页。。。 8. See Reinhart and Rogoff (2009b). Eventually, other studies, like that of the

International Monetary Fund, cast doubt on the existence of this threshold (see

Pescatori, Sandri, and Simon 2014). 9. See Alesina and Ardagna (2010). The IMF responded with a critique of the generality of these findings as well (IMF 2010). 10. Agreement was then reached in December 2013 to create a single resolution mechanism. But this was again half a loaf: the EU agreed that it would continue to rely on national resolution authorities for an interim period and fully fund its resolution mechanism only after a transition lasting as long as ten years.

Chapter 1 1. The background to the exposé is described by Harris (2010). 2. This time Ponzi attempted to escape by faking suicide and boarding an Italian freighter, on which he worked as a waiter and dishwasher. Unable to resist describing his exploits, he revealed himself and was arrested when the ship docked in New Orleans. Despite appealing to President Calvin Coolidge and

Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini, Ponzi was extradited to Massachusetts to serve out his term. On release in 1934 he was deported to Italy. Ponzi died in Brazil after moving there to work for a local airline and allegedly becoming involved in a smuggling ring. 3. Klein (2001), p. 89. 4. “And today the dredge is the national emblem of Florida,” Rogers (1925, p. 88) went on to conclude. 5. Interest rates plural because each Reserve bank set its own discount rate, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board (more on this below). 6. So Strong testified to the House Committee on Banking and Currency in 1926. U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Banking and Currency, “Stabilization,” Hearings, 69th Congress, 1st Session, on H.R. 7895 (Washington, D.C., 1927), p. 507. 7. Annual Report of the Federal Reserve Board for 1925, pp. 288–89. Or, as

Charles Evans Hughes, President Harding’s secretary of state, put it, “The prosperity of the United States largely depends on the economic settlements which may be made in Europe.” Cited in Pusey (1951), p. 579. 8. The passage quoted is from a memo he wrote in early 1925, cited in Clarke (1967), p. 74. 9. Wells (1933), pp. 85–86. Among the other things Wells got right was the advent of Wikipedia (as one can learn from the entry on The Shape of Things to

Come on Wikipedia). 10. Strong also teamed up with a syndicate of banks headed by J. P. Morgan &

Co. to extend a $300 million line of credit to the Bank of England and the

British government. The Federal Reserve provided $200 million to the Bank of England, while the J. P. Morgan–headed syndicate lent $100 million to the

British government. 11. See Moggridge (1969), pp. 71–75. 12. Clarke (1967), pp. 76–77. 13. Norris (1937), pp. 202–3. 14. On Miller and the real-bills doctrine, see Timberlake (2005, 2008) and Wells (2004). 15. Wueschner (1999), p. xiv. 16. Ibid., p. 27. 17. Parks (2006), p. 23. 18. The amendment had the additional effect of exempting state-chartered banks from corporate profit taxes—a provision that further helps to explain how it ended up on the ballot (Vickers 1994). 19. As the boom gained momentum, anxious property developers, perhaps predictably, accepted smaller and smaller down payments. 20. Developers like Carl Fisher providing financing directly to purchasers might on occasion accept a down payment of, say, 25 percent. As time went on, there were further exceptions; see the discussion of building and loan associations below. 21. Redford (1970), p. 151. 22. Simpson (1933), p. 164. 23. The difference between a B&L and a mutual savings bank was that members in a B&L subscribed shares rather than making deposits. Members accumulated shares by making weekly or monthly installment payments equivalent to the amount they expected to require to finance their homes and took turns borrowing; at least this was the principle, if not always the practice (Rose and Snowden 2013). 24. The regulated mortgage lending sector in the 1920s was relatively small: it was made up of mutual savings banks, state commercial banks, and national banks that had been given authority to lend on real estate only as of 1913. 25. Thus, although B&Ls were not subject to runs, they could still be rendered insolvent by widespread defaults on share installment contracts, as happened in the 1930s. 26. In the words of Snowden and James (2001, p. 5), “Many B&Ls were run as part-time businesses out of second-floor offices—most often as appendages of the real estate or insurance business of their managing officer.” 27. As the boom developed and banks grew concerned about default risk, building and loans stepped into the breach, offering both first and second mortgages themselves. These paired mortgages were known as split loans, a terminology and practice that would come back to haunt the housing market after an interval of eighty years. 28. Title and mortgage guarantee companies were required by New York State law (New York State being where many of them were headquartered) to hold a reserve fund against this contingency, but the minimum reserve was set as a share of capital and surplus, not as a share of bond obligations outstanding (White 2013). 29. This is the conclusion of the study of the market by Goetzmann and Newman (2010). 30. The boom in Detroit was yet another reflection of the importance to the decade of the automobile. Again, Florida was not left out; popular magazines like The Atlantic Monthly published advertisements from bond houses such as the Filer-Cleveland Co. offering individual investors bonds yielding a coupon of 8 percent, a very high level for the time, backed by first mortgages on income-paying commercial real estate in Miami. 31. The quote is from George (1986), p. 34. Flagler Street was named for Henry

Flagler, of Standard Oil fame, who had been a prime mover in building Florida’s railways and, not incidentally, extending them to Miami. 32. That many residents were recent arrivals probably helps to account for their failure to make adequate preparations and for the resulting fatalities. 33. The enforceability of these measures is another matter. On the effectiveness of blue-sky laws in this period, see Chapter 16. 34. Sessa (1961), pp. 41–43. 35. These figures are for the period between March and December 1926. 36. Chain banking, in which a single set of owners acquires several banks as a way of circumventing laws prohibiting branch banking, figures importantly in the 1930 banking crisis and therefore in Chapter 8. As described by Vickers (1994), the Manley-Anthony chain had lent heavily not just for Merrick’s Coral

Gables project but also for the even more ambitious Boca Raton development of the Ponzi-like Addison Mizner. There are indications that the chain was insolvent even before the real estate bust, owing to insider loans to Manley’s and Anthony’s auto dealerships and other enterprises, but it stayed in business as a result of the forbearance of the regulators, which finally became impossible with the real estate decline. Following the collapse of the property boom, Mizner’s development corporation was taken over by the Central

Equities Corporation of Chicago, owned by Vice President Charles Dawes and his brothers. Central Equities stripped the development corporation and its principal lender, the Palm Beach National Bank, of their assets before turning them over to the custody of the bankruptcy court. The same Charles Dawes features in the financial rehabilitation of Europe starting in 1924 and the

Chicago banking crisis of 1932 (Chapters 3 and 10, respectively). 37. On the policy of direct pressure, see Chapter 3.

Chapter 2 1. Brooks (1969), pp. 65–66. 2. Consistent with this observation, Galbraith (1954), following Allen (1931), dates the inception of the bubble as March 1928. 3. Technically, control of General Motors passed to Pierre du Pont, yet another

MIT graduate, but du Pont quickly appointed Sloan as his right-hand man. 4. Sloan’s public relations offensive is described by Marchand (1991). 5. For more on the Dawes Plan, see Chapter 3. 6. The protocol finalizing the reparations bill was signed in 1921. This and related figures in the text are based on calculations in Webb (1988). 7. This was the “transfer problem” over whose solution Keynes and Bertil Ohlin jousted in the 1920s (Keynes 1929, Ohlin 1929). 8. Lloyd George (1932), p. 67. 9. Subsequent accounts affirm this impression of Poincaré as “cold, distant, unemotional” (Wright, 1942, p. 24) but portray the man and his policies as less stridently anti-German. One story has it that Lloyd George had only himself to blame for Poincaré’s return to power in January 1922, explaining why he was so bitter about the fact. The British prime minister had treated his sitting French counterpart, Aristide Briand, to a round of golf. This evidence that he was on friendly terms with a British leader who favored compromise on reparations was enough for Briand to be recalled to Paris and replaced by Poincaré (Keiger 1997). 10. Specifically, it announced that it would no longer accept the emergency currency known as “Notgeld” that large businesses paid their workers when they experienced shortages of money. It was one of the ironies of the hyperinflation that the central bank could not keep pace with the demand for money, forcing large enterprises to pay their workers in private money. This was the Notgeld that the Reichsbank now refused to discount. 11. Hawtrey (1962), p. 3. 12. This with inflation measured at an annualized rate. Wholesale price inflation, which reflected the sharp drop in the franc exchange rate, rose to a catastrophic 80-plus percent. 13. The French authorities also used the foreign credits to “squeeze the bears,” buying francs and pushing up their value in an attempt to inflict losses on speculators who had sold the franc forward. Whether these operations in fact drove the speculators out of the market or merely had psychological implications is uncertain. 14. And in keeping with the affinity for music of interwar politicians (see Charles

Dawes and William Woodin, in Chapters 3 and 15 below), he was also a biographer of Beethoven. 15. This is the conclusion of Blancheton (2012) on the basis of his close reading of the archival evidence. 16. Mouré (2002), p. 106. 17. The classic reference in this context is Sargent and Wallace (1981). 18. See Chapter 26. 19. Moreau (1991), p. 225. 20. Smith (1916), pp. 197, 201. 21. Miller (1935), p. 449.

Chapter 3 1. Lewis (1938), p. 336. 2. Britain’s wartime denials to the contrary, munitions were indeed present, as described by Mullaly (2009). 3. The Dawes Brothers and their financial endeavors have already made an appearance in connection with the Florida land boom; see Chapter 1. 4. Timmons (1953), p. 218. 5. The knowledge that any further reduction in the burden of reparations overall would automatically elicit calls from the Europeans for a commensurate reduction in the burden of war debts owed the United States further inclined them in this direction. 6. This was the same strategy used by the lead US negotiator, William Rhodes, when defaulted Latin American debts were restructured in the 1980s and 1990s. See Rhodes (2011). 7. Costigliola (1976), p. 595. 8. In addition, private loans under the Dawes Plan were effectively senior to reparations payments. They enjoyed what was known as “transfer protection,” or first call on the limited foreign exchange reserves of the Reichsbank. This encouraged foreign investors to buy German bonds and, even more, German policy makers to encourage German corporations and municipalities to issue them, as a way of minimizing actual reparations payments and strengthening their case for renegotiation. See Ritschl (2013). 9. Note that 1926 was a more difficult year for placing foreign bonds in the United

States, what with turbulent financial conditions in France and the coal strike in

Britain (see Chapter 2). 10. Flandreau, Gaillard, and Panizza (2010) show that the riskiness of a loan and its probability of default were less a function of whether it was underwritten by an investment or commercial bank than of what they refer to as the “prestige” of the institution—that is, how concerned the underwriter was with the maintenance of its reputation, as captured by how long it had been in existence and its capitalization. 11. Winkler (1933), p. 87. 12. Lewis (1938), p. 377. 13. Cited in ibid., p. 380. 14. Many of these dubious practices came to light as a result of the hearings of the

Pecora Commission, which sensationally investigated 1920s financial excesses in 1993 (Chapter 16). 15. White (1990b), p. 147. 16. Shades of collateralized debt obligations being repackaged into yet other collateralized obligations in the period leading up to 2008. See Chapter 5. 17. Einzig (1931), p. 53. 18. Costigliola (1976), p. 495. 19. This was one reason Schacht stepped up his conversion of sterling balances into gold, his hope being that doing so might put pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates and divert capital flows in its direction. 20. Gilbert’s memorandum is reproduced in Hearings, p. 25. 21. This raised the number in operation by half. 22. Klein (2001), p. 147. 23. Bank credit had risen by 8 percent in 1927, when loans on stocks and bonds were the most rapidly growing component of lending. Meltzer (2003), p. 228. 24. This is the so-called leverage cycle of which John Geanakoplos, inspired by the recent crisis, has written (2010). 25. This he eventually did six months later (see Chapter 7). 26. Miller (1935), p. 453. 27. In addition, the New York bank’s priorities may have also been affected by the fact that George Harrison replaced Benjamin Strong as head of the bank in late 1928. Strong had repeatedly warned that any attempt to rein in stock market speculation by raising rates might damage the economy (Friedman and

Schwartz 1963, p. 254 et seq.). But in 1929 he was no longer present to invest this view with his authority. 28. For example, in late 2013 the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which is both the country’s central bank and its macroprudential regulator, imposed a cap on loan-tovalue ratios to cool off the stock market. One of the concerns about the effectiveness of the measure was the extent to which nonbank credit would be substituted for bank credit to the mortgage market. See Reserve Bank of New Zealand (2013). 29. Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 266, similarly dismiss the policy of direct pressure as a failure, but they are unclear about what the Fed should have done instead, since they too are critical of the impact on the economy of raising interest rates in mid-1929.

Chapter 4 1. Loeb initially provided underwriting services for the partnership from New York but moved to Southern California once the firm took off. 2. This authorization was provided by the Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970. 3. For more on the regulatory response to the financial crisis of the 1930s see

Chapter 15. 4. The contemporary perception was that excessive competition for funds on the part of commercial banks had driven up the cost of attracting demand deposits and encouraged the banks to engage in risky investments, contributing to the banking crisis. In addition, Regulation Q was seen as a means of enabling community banks to compete for deposits and lend to their local communities (Gilbert 1986). 5. More on whom below. 6. Weber (2008), p. B5. 7. This occurred starting in 1966. 8. See Reagan’s “Remarks on Signing the Garn–St. Germain Depository

Institutions Act of 1982” (October 15), http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/​ speeches/1982/101582b.htm. 9. That the S&L industry had already been plunged into crisis by the combination of high interest rates and soft housing prices gave the commercial banks little relief. Thrifts responded to their distress by gambling for redemption—and plunging even more aggressively into commercial banking activities. 10. These trends are described by Wilmarth (2002). 11. Weill and Kraushaar (2006), p. 364. 12. Weill and Kraushaar (2006), pp. 265–66. 13. The wooden slab is described in Brooker (2010). Weill’s mea culpa is reported in the Wall Street Journal’s “Heard on the Street” column (July 26, 2012, p. C12).

This is not to argue that the abolition of Glass-Steagall caused the financial crisis. But neither can its role be entirely dismissed, as attempted by Sorkin (2012). The point is that the progressive weakening and elimination of the

Glass-Steagall restrictions was part, and in turn indicative, of a broader process in whose absence the financial crisis cannot be understood. 14. In the Irish case, this was partly offshore banking: foreign banks funneled their lending to other countries through their Irish subsidiaries in order to take advantage of the favorable tax treatment extended them by the Irish

Republic. Be this as it may, the ratio of bank claims to GDP was nearly as high in Belgium, the Netherlands, and a number of other European countries. 15. The Cypriot case is special in that many liabilities were to large extra-EU depositors, notably Russian oligarchs, rather than Northern European banks.

But this does not change the fact that Cyprus became the poster child for an overleveraged and undercapitalized banking system. 16. Whether there was actual evidence supporting the contention that large, diversified banks were more efficient and delivered lower-cost services to their customers is a separate issue. Skeptical contemporary analyses included Rhodes (1994), Pilloff (1996), Peristiani (1997), and DeLong (1998). 17. For more on this argument, see Barth, Brumbaugh, and Wilcox (2000). 18. Suarez and Kolodny (2011), p. 79. 19. This is documented by Philippon (2008). 20. As they did in the upswing beginning in 2001, a point documented using individual bank data by Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen, and Yesiltas (2012). 21. Ibid., ­figure 4. See below on the regulatory changes that facilitated these developments. 22. “Realizing those losses” is another way of saying “mark its assets to market.”

Following the Enron scandal, which came to light in 2001, financial as well as nonfinancial firms were increasingly required, notably under the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to mark to market. 23. This is the explanation of Gorton and Souleles (2007) for why, in bad times, sponsoring banks bring their SPVs back onto their balance sheets. 24. It was exactly this mechanism that had launched Enron, which relied heavily on SPVs, on its death spiral in 2001. But this did not slow the spread of the practice. 25. Morgenson and Rosner (2001) argue that the answer to this question is capture: that the banks wanted it this way, and the Federal Reserve as regulator did their bidding. The alternative hypothesis is ignorance. 26. See ISDA (2010). 27. For details see Ranciere and Tornell (2009), ­figure 1. More precisely, their figure compares private domestic nonfinancial-sector mortgage debt with private domestic nonfinancial-sector nonmortgage debt. 28. Data are from Shiller (2006), as updated and available online at http://www.​ econ.yale.edu/~shiller/data.htm. 29. New home construction responded predictably: starts of single-family units rose nationally from the customary 1.2 million new units per year to more than 1.7 million units in 2005.

Chapter 5 1. Details in this paragraph are from Mian and Sufi (2009). 2. Brian Clarkson, co-chief operating officer of Moody’s Investor Service, in charge of global structured finance and US public finance, acknowledged as much in a 2004 internal email: “To put it bluntly, the issuer could take its business elsewhere unless the rating agency provides a higher rating.” Quoted in Tabbi (2013). Becker and Milbourn (2011) consider a “natural experiment”: the entry of a third rating agency, Fitch, in competition with Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. They show that this increased the scope for ratings shopping and resulted in less informative, more inflated ratings. 3. “Watch out / Housing market went softer / Cooling down / Strong market is now much weaker / Subprime is boiling over / Bringing down the house.” Even

George Merrick (Chapter 1) could have done better. 4. US Department of Justice (2013), pp. 73–74, 78. 5. More arguments to this effect are found in Bolton, Freixas, and Shapiro (2012). 6. Those nonbank lenders were disproportionately the source of subprime loans that subsequently lapsed into default. This is documented by Dagher and Fu (2012). 7. That Countrywide eventually experienced financial difficulties as a result of subprime loans that went bad and became a takeover target for Bank of

America did not make its earlier operations any less profitable for Mozilo personally. Legal action, however, did. In 2009 Mozilo was accused by the SEC of insider trading and securities fraud for having talked up the stock—disguising underlying problems with the company—while selling shares. In 2010 he settled with the SEC, agreeing to $67.5 million in fines, $20 million of which was paid by Countrywide as provided for by his employment contract. 8. The report was published by the center in February (Center for Responsible

Lending 2008). 9. See Jacobson (2009). In 2012 Jacobson filed suit against Wells Fargo, alleging that the bank had sought retribution by returning her loan payments and foreclosing on her home. 10. Jacobson’s affidavit accused Wells Fargo employees of doing the same. The practice evidently changed in late 2006, when the housing and mortgage industry came under closer scrutiny (Morgenson 2007). 11. These margins are described in internal firm documents reported by Morgenson (2007). Washington Mutual, another leader in the subprime business, similarly estimated that subprime loans and option ARMs were six to ten times as profitable as traditional mortgage products (Bair 2012, p. 76). 12. See Federal Reserve Board (2009). 13. Freddie’s initial mandate was to create a secondary mortgage market, which in practice meant purchasing mortgages in California, guaranteeing them, and reselling them to banks in other states as a way of circumventing existing restrictions on cross-state banking and thereby accommodating the Golden

State’s rapid growth. 14. In Angelides (2011). 15. In addition to purchasing securitizations, Fannie and Freddie could purchase mortgages outright. They continued to do so, but at rates that did nothing to change the picture of their declining importance to the mortgage market after 2003. 16. In 2006 the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight sued Raines to recover a portion of the bonuses he had received that were based on the overstated earnings. Civil charges were filed against Raines and two other former

Fannie executives. These were settled in 2008, with Raines and the other executives agreeing to repay a portion of the payments they had received. 17. On a monthly average basis, the Fed funds rate fell from 6.4 percent in

December 2000 to 1.8 percent in December 2001. 18. See, for example, Bernanke (2000). 19. The quotation in the text is from Bernanke (2002a). 20. FOMC Meeting Transcript (November 2002), p. 83, http://www.federalre​serve. gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC20021106meeting.pdf. 21. This was something that Bernanke himself knew perfectly well, having served on the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee from mid-2000 until his appointment to the board of governors in 2002. 22. Dokko et al. (2011), ­figure 3. 23. See Taylor (2007). There are as many ways of operationalizing the Taylor Rule as there are of measuring inflation and the output gap. Taylor’s own retrospective estimates generated a larger gap between actual and warranted policy rates than many of the alternatives. Bernanke’s own 2010 estimates, using the data available at the time, point to a smaller discrepancy. 24. This being the conclusion of the Taylor article cited in the preceding note. 25. The staff study in question, with the allusion to “housing-specific shocks,” was

Dokko et al. (2011). 26. A good statement of the view is Kohn (2009). 27. The overall conclusion of empirical analyses of this question was that good policy was mainly responsible for the moderation of inflation, but that good luck had more to do with the moderation of output fluctuations. See Stock and

Watson (2003). 28. Figures here are from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (Federal Reserve

Economic Data website). 29. Rates on conventional mortgages fell from 6.3 to 5.6 percent; http://research.​ stlouisfed.org/fred2/data/GS10.txt. 30. This quoting from Greenspan’s rebuttal (2009) to Taylor’s indictment that loose

Fed policy in 2003–05 had caused the housing bubble. 31. It is not right to put the onus for global imbalances entirely on Asia. As noted above, oil exporters like Saudi Arabia, benefiting from strong Chinese growth and high petroleum prices, also ran large external surpluses and recycled their savings in the US treasury market. Germany similarly ran growing current account surpluses as the period progressed. 32. This according to the economists Nouriel Roubini and Brad Setser in papers circulated in the fall of 2004. Subsequent estimates tended to be smaller but pointed in the same direction. The speech that made the term “global savings glut” famous was Bernanke (2005).

Chapter 6 1. Figures vary, depending on how they are constructed. Those here are based on annual averages of the S&P/Case Shiller National Composite Index (US) and the

European Central Bank Index (existing dwellings for both Ireland and Spain). 2. Although Spain, starting out far behind, made a notable effort to catch up starting in 2005. 3. The precedent for the latter was the European Coal and Steel Community, established in 1951, which applied multilateral oversight to Germany’s coal and steel industries, and out of which the European Economic Community subsequently grew. 4. Both cited in Szaz (1999), p. 216. 5. The importance of fiscal transfers for the smooth operation of a monetary union goes back to the work of Peter Kenen (1969). The need for banking union to accompany monetary union was perhaps less widely understood, even in the 1990s, given that the cross-border penetration of European banks was still in its early stages. But less widely understood does not mean that the case was unappreciated; see inter alia Eichengreen (1993). 6. Cited in the Guardian (January 12), http://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/​ jan/13/martinwalker. 7. For a sampling of such arguments from political science, see McKay (1996) and

Jones (2002). 8. This between 1994 and 1998, when the decision on founding membership was taken. 9. In addition to the fact that EU policy was made by consensus, the key country for the monetary union, Germany, marginally violated the Maastricht criterion limiting its debt to 60 percent of GDP in 1997 and 1998, when the decision was taken. If the criterion was going to be waived for Germany, even slightly, then it was correspondingly harder to enforce for other countries. 10. See Story, Thomas, and Schwartz (2010) for details. 11. Yields on Irish government bonds had also been higher than those on German bunds, although not that much higher, courtesy of the country’s Celtic Tiger status. 12. Given how widely these beliefs were embraced by money managers and how quickly interest rates converged across the Eurozone, it is worth recalling the skepticism of economists that market participants would respond in this way.

Bishop (1992) anticipated that market participants would strongly differentiate among potential borrowers according to their debt loads and consequent creditworthiness. Buiter, Corsetti, and Roubini (1993) similarly predicted that large default risk premia would continue to distinguish Europe’s high-debt countries. 13. The ECB further encouraged the convergence of interest rates by applying the same haircuts, or discounts, to “repos” of the government securities of euro-area countries. That is, it applied an identical discount to the securities of governments when accepting these as collateral in repurchase operations conducted with commercial banks. This in turn encouraged the banks to invest equally in the securities of, say, Greece and Germany because they could be “repoed” at the same price at the ECB, driving the prices of initially cheaper Greek bonds up to the German level. The associated dangers were pointed to early on by

Buiter and Sibert (2005). In practice the ECB repoed mainly very-short-term obligations (including ten-year bonds about to mature). Thus, this mechanism cannot be the entire explanation for why there was such strong convergence in the interest rates on the entire spectrum of government bonds. 14. Quantitatively Ireland was less strongly affected, although the qualitative phenomenon was the same. 15. Those reforms increased the incentive to work, and thus for the unions to bargain for relatively modest increases in wage payments, by combining unemployment assistance and welfare payments and placing a cap on the combination. 16. This is documented in Lane and Pels (2012). 17. Be that as it may, these pressures were all part of the same process. Germany may not have competed directly with Southern European countries that specialized in the production of consumer goods, but it ramped up its exports of capital goods to China, whose producers used them to increase their capacity to export consumer goods to Europe. The impact on distressed Southern

European producers was the same. 18. The larger the capital inflow, the larger the cumulative increase in real property prices, and the greater the rise in construction activity, as documented by

Obstfeld and Rogoff (2010). 19. Here capital refers to the sum of tier 1 capital (shareholders’ equity) and tier 2 capital (other “equity like” capital such as undisclosed reserves, provisions, hybrid instruments, and subordinated debt). 20. This on the eve of the crisis. 21. Vendor finance being when a company lends money so that the borrower can buy the vendor’s products or property. 22. The “banking glut” idea is developed by Shin (2012). 23. See, for example, Saurina (2009).

They put the peak in textiles in July and the peak in paper in September. By their calculations the peak for automobiles and transport equipment actually came earlier, in February. Burns and Mitchell (1946), p. 69. 10. Cited in Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 264. 11. Norman was loath to admit as much, for example in his testimony before the

Macmillan Committee, to which he testified in March 1930, but his motivation was evident between the lines. Norman’s remarks, heavily edited, were published in 1931 (Committee on Finance and Industry 1931). 12. Lee Bevan and Haig-Thomas had the University of Cambridge in common.

Haig-Thomas came from a well-to-do family of coal mine owners and was best known for having rowed for Cambridge in 1902. He went on to be a successful if controversial rowing coach first at Cambridge and then at Oxford. 13. Bevan left prison in 1928 and moved to Havana in order to remain beyond the reach of the ever-attentive British press. Among other things, he shared with George Merrick a taste for poetry, publishing (“on commission,” that is, through personal subvention) a book of verse in 1929. A recent biography that tells Bevan’s story is Vander Weyer (2011). 14. Quoted in The Economist (April 5, 1924, p. 733). Jute Industries did not go on to pay a dividend, and its shares performed poorly. It did, however, survive into the post–World War II years. Not so British Glass Industries. To create it,

Hatry amalgamated a large number of firms producing lightbulbs, lamp glass used for scientific and industrial purposes, and crystal tableware. He financed the construction of two large glass factories as a way of forcing smaller firms into the amalgam. Within two years the company was in financial difficulty. By 1926 it had failed and its assets were sold off to a third party. As The Economist (September 28, 1929, p. 576) put it after the 1929 scandal, Hatry “was a pioneer of rationalization in its most irrational form.” 15. Of “Ricardian equivalence” fame—see the Introduction, note 5. 16. Manley (1976), p. 56. 17. The Bank of United States episode is described in Chapter 8, the failure of

Banque Adam in Chapter 9, and the Icelandic crisis in Chapter 14. 18. After two years of hard labor, Hatry was transferred to Maidstone Prison in

Kent, where he became prison librarian (succeeding, among others, Bevan in the position). Freed in 1939, he rented an office near Fleet Street and built a thriving business advising booksellers. In the course of World War II, he acquired bookstores, a printing company, a publishing house, and two magazines and soon was bidding for Wyman & Sons, one of Britain’s largest bookselling chains. In the end these ventures were unsuccessful as well, and Hatry spent the 1950s operating Hatchards, a well-known London bookshop, and a series of West End coffee bars. The Marquess of Winchester, for his part, was declared bankrupt and spent the rest of his life in Monte Carlo. 19. The total financial “deficiency” was several times greater, reflecting also the intragroup liabilities of Hatry’s various companies. 20. Wall Street Journal (January 15, 1930), p. 15. 21.

Chapter 8 1. This according to the board of governors’ series, adjusted for the season.

Subsequent efforts to reconstruct the national income accounts on a quarterly basis (Balke and Gordon 1986) show real GDP as falling at an alarming 20 percent annual rate in the final three months of the year. 2. The 2008–09 crisis similarly featured a sharp fall in global trade and saw dispute over whether the main cause was anticipations of weak final demand or financial disruptions. 3. In the latter case this was due not just to weak demand but also to a record harvest. 4. This was the diagnosis of the clinicians at the Economist (May 31, 1930, p. 1205). 5. The board of governors also authorized the New York bank to purchase $50 million of government securities. 6. “The State of Trade at Home and Abroad,” Economist Monthly Supplement (May 31, 1930, p. 33). 7. In other countries the decline was more limited, but movement was in the same direction. The fall in industrial production December over December was 11 percent in Canada, 8 percent in Sweden, and 7 percent in France. In the UK, where the Board of Trade constructed industrial production figures quarterly, the 1929Q4–1930Q4 decline was 13 percent. 8. “Events abroad” refers to those occurring in Germany, which are considered below. 9. They were falling, in other words, at a 14 percent annual clip. It could be argued that wholesale prices, which were heavily affected by conditions in distressed commodity markets, were not necessarily the best measure of underlying price level trends. But finished goods prices were falling as well, at a 10 percent annual rate. 10. Hamilton (1992), table 7. Cecchetti (1992), using time series on prices and interest rates to construct a forecasting model, similarly concludes that investors looking forward three to six months would have anticipated deflation by late 1930 and also quite possibly already by late 1929. Be that as it may, the members of the board of governors were not accustomed to distinguishing between real and nominal interest rates. Even if futures markets pointed to falling prices, this did not lead them to alter their conclusion that credit was cheap.

In practice the governors referred all but exclusively to nominal interest rates.

Meltzer (2003), p. 295. 11. Yields on high-grade bonds remained above 4.5 percent. The spread between

AAA and Baa bonds widened further, an indication that firms with marginal credit were being rationed out of financial markets. 12. Miller’s words are from his appearance before the US House of Representatives

Committee on Banking and Currency (1928), http://www.​scribd.com/ doc/175280593/housta28. 13. Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 368. 14. In addition to the fact that the tariff did little to ameliorate farm problems,

Hawley was burdened by being a “dry” while his primary opponent was a “wet” in this, the penultimate year of Prohibition. 15. By comparison, the Fordney-McCumber Tariff of 1922 had pushed up rates by thirteen points. Irwin (2011), pp. 105–7. 16. Ibid., p. 140. 17. New York Times (November 11, 1929, p. 2). 18.

All this is described by Hamilton (1985). 23. This is the conclusion of Temin (1976) and Wicker (1996), for example. 24. As described by McFerrin (1969), Caldwell included in his bond transactions a depository agreement that provided for maintaining the proceeds of bond sales at the Bank of Tennessee until they were required to meet construction costs. 25. See Chapter 1. 26. Lea was the great-grandson of a two-term congressman and US senator himself from 1911 to 1917. Horton had previously nominated the younger Lea to fill an open US Senate seat, which he declined, finding it more profitable to remain in real estate. 27. This point is documented further by Richardson and Troost (2009) and Jalil (2012). 28. The episode gave rise to an investigation by the Federal Reserve Board, which concluded that four members of the Atlanta party, including the deputy governor, had gotten drunk on the boat. The Atlanta Fed’s own investigation concluded, to the contrary, that all members of the party had performed admirably.

Ultimately the board’s view prevailed, and the deputy governor tendered his resignation. See Gamble (1989), Richardson and Toorst (2009), and Jalil (2012). 29. New York Times (November 14, 1930, p. 19). 30. Washington Post (November 14, 1930, p. 2). 31. This is an interesting exception to Friedman and Schwartz’s observation that the creation of the Federal Reserve System ruled out the earlier practice of suspending cash payments as a way of containing financial crises. As it happened, the Arkansas bank had no choice; it had the bad luck of being in the Federal

Reserve District of St. Louis, and the St. Louis Fed was not inclined to help. See

Richardson and Troost (2009). 32. New York Times (December 20, 1930, p. 1). 33. This according to Joseph H. Zweeres, the state bank examiner who reviewed

Bank of United States in the summer of 1929. New York Times (June 5, 1932, p. 3). 34. Trescott (1992), pp. 391–92. Early intervention or not, New York State

Superintendent of Banking Joseph A. Broderick was subsequently indicted by a grand jury for neglect of duty for not having taken appropriate steps to head off the Bank of United States failure. Eventually he was acquitted. 35. See Chapter 12. 36. This is suggested by Friedman and Schwartz (1963). See, however, O’Brien (1992) on the limitations of their evidence. 37. The condition of the Bank of United States turned out not as bad as feared. The receiver ended up paying creditors 84 cents on the dollar, not terrible by the standards of financial bankruptcy. This reflected the subsequent recovery of the bank’s real estate holdings, the last of which were finally liquidated in 1944.

Lehman Brothers’ receiver should have done so well. 38. See Chapter 14.

Chapter 9 1. Details are from Bonin (1996). 2. A representative compendium of British commentary is Royal Institute of

International Affairs (1931). 3. New York Times (July 10, 1931, p. 21). 4. The ECB did so by agreeing to buy bonds only on the secondary market, its statute prohibiting it from purchasing new primary issuance, and by buying the bonds only of countries that first agreed to a program with the EU’s emergency rescue fund. 5. This refers to capital and reserves as of 1929, according to Adalet (2009), p. 8.

Other data in this paragraph are similarly drawn from this paper. The fact that capital ratios did not recover to pre-inflation levels raises the question of why the banks didn’t move faster to raise capital. Part of the explanation is that doing so was expensive, and competition among savings banks, mortgage banks, and universal banks caused them all to attempt to economize on costs, including those of capital. 6. At its peak in 1929, cash and balances on reserve at the central bank as a share of deposits was just 3.8 percent, barely half the pre–World War I level. 7. In 1930 an emergency loan was arranged through the good offices of the

Boston-based investment bank Lee, Higginson & Co., with the help of the soon-to-be-notorious safety-match magnate Ivar Kreuger, but it was not repeated. Kreuger started as a civil engineer and co-manager of a construction company, Kreuger & Toll Byggnads AB, known for its innovative building techniques. Construction led him into finance and then, reflecting Sweden’s timber resources, into production of safety matches. He purchased concessions from governments granting him national monopolies on the production and sale of matches, which he financed by securitizing the expected returns on future concessions. Kreuger’s financial pyramid did not withstand the shock of the Great Depression. He was found dead in his flat in Paris in March 1932, triggering the Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget crisis. A recent biography of

Kreuger is Partnoy (2009). When Kreuger’s empire collapsed in 1932, Lee,

Higginson was stuck with the tab and never entirely recovered. 8. See Ferguson and Temin (2003). 9. This is the argument of Borchardt (1991). 10. More than 50 percent of joint-stock bank assets, to be precise. There were also a number of smaller private banks, whose assets are omitted from this calculation. 11. Even more so than in Germany; the Creditanstalt’s own capital in 1925 was barely a fifth of the 1913 level, according to the calculations of Teichova (1994). 12. The expectation was not without basis: even before the crisis in the spring of 1931, the Austrian National Bank had set up a system, in conjunction with Rothschilds in London and a handful of other foreign banks, to surreptitiously funnel low-cost funding to the Creditanstalt to help it manage its Bodencreditanstalt burden (Aguado 2001). 13. Schubert (1991), p. 12. 14. German banks were important creditors of the Creditanstalt and the other

Austrian joint-stock banks. In addition, Austrian policy makers had doubted the economic viability of their small country ever since the Empire was dismantled after World War I and saw the customs union with Germany as a potential solution to this problem. They hoped that with completion of the customs union a stronger Germany might be inclined to provide foreign aid.

The Germans for their part worried that Austria might instead form a customs union with the countries of southeast Europe that were previously part of its

Empire, should Berlin not offer a better deal. On these and other motivations, see Mommsen and Forster (1998) and Orde (1980). 15. Between them, the government, the Austrian National Bank, the Postal

Savings Bank, and various other public agencies now owned fully 50 percent of the bank (Schubert 1991, p. 10). 16. The impact on the central bank was even worse than revealed, as the Austrian

National Bank, taking a leaf from the French, dressed its books to disguise the extent to which it had financed foreign withdrawals from the Creditanstalt.

Aguado (2001), p. 212. 17. Schubert (1991), p. 15. 18. Hodson (1932), p. 211. 19. Schacht (1955), p. 173. Schacht had worked with Goldschmidt on the board of

Danatbank and previously on the board of the Nationalbank für Deutschland during and after World War I. 20. This is the argument of Ferguson and Temin (2003) and Pontzen (2009). 21. Brüning himself had encouraged the idea in meetings with the US ambassador,

Frederic Sackett. In addition, there was the fact that reparations had been given effective seniority over private debts as a result of the Young Plan (reversing the senior status that private debt enjoyed under the Dawes Plan). Hence the bankers, Thomas Lamont of J. P. Morgan for example, were already lobbying Hoover for a reparations moratorium. 22. On Meyer’s involvement with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, see

Chapter 10. 23. Pusey (1974), p. 209. 24. Laval’s complaint is in Warner (1968), p. 32; Hoover’s response is in Burner (2005), p. 302. After three weeks of not-so-silent protest, the French government grudgingly accepted the moratorium proposal. 25. The most the chancellor was willing to offer was private reassurance that he would not seek funds for a third armored cruiser. 26. The bank was then put in trusteeship to permit orderly liquidation of its assets.

Schacht, as onetime partner, was asked to head the committee of trustees but declined. 27. The Lahusen brothers were then arrested on July 17, after the banks reopened, and Nordwalle quickly declared bankruptcy. The de facto freeze on German payments to foreign creditors was officially recognized by the Standstill Agreement, negotiated at a July 20 meeting of officials in London and signed in September.

Chapter 10 1. On docking on his return, the governor reportedly had to wait for the drive back from Liverpool to London to receive a full briefing. His first day back at work was September 28, a week after sterling was devalued. 2. There was not even a symbolic increase in the discount rate after July 30.

Previously the rate had been raised twice, once on July 23 and once a week later, each time by a percentage point. 3. Hawtrey (1938), p. 143. 4. In an untimely coincidence, the committee’s report was issued in mid-July. See

Committee on Finance and Industry (1931), especially appendices I and IV. 5. Accominotti (2012), p. 17. Whether or not this rendered them insolvent would depend on whether they were able eventually to recoup part of what they were owed. 6. In all, it bought some £30 million of bills to provide the markets with liquidity. 7. Investors who took this position ended up making 20 percent in two months.

To the extent that they leveraged their bets, they made greater returns still. 8. Sullivan (1936), p. 1. 9. Federal Reserve Bank of New York (1932), p. 13. 10. Excepting the Atlanta and Minneapolis Reserve Banks, which were already maintaining higher rates than other banks in the system. 11. A comprehensive account of these events is Wicker (1996). 12. Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 382. 13. On Kreuger, see Chapter 9. 14. These notes were known as clearinghouse certificates because they were accepted by all members of the clearinghouse, the association through which banks settled, or cleared, payments with one another. Their role and the story of the 1907 crisis are described by Bruner and Carr (2007). 15. Barber (1985), p. 227. 16. To this end, the strong banks insisted that the NCC should value collateral at market—that is to say, fire-sale—prices, advance loans only up to 30 percent of that market value, and not accept real estate. Olson (1977), p. 29. 17. See Chapter 19. 18. Hoover had asked for even quicker action but did not take into account the

Christmas recess. 19. This Glass-Steagall Act was different from the act of 1933 that separated commercial banking from investment banking (more on which below). 20. Insull was also able to borrow $2 million from the Owen Young–headed

General Electric Corporation in 1931. Vickers (2011) provides a conspiratorial account of the Dawes-Young-Insull relationship and the problems of Central

Republic, but, conspiracy or not, the close connection between the three men is undeniable. 21. Fifteen percent of its share capital and “surplus” (or unallocated funds), to be precise. 22. Vickers (2011), pp. 56–57. 23. When in October he was charged with embezzlement by a Cook County grand jury, Insull fled Paris for Milan and then leased a small plane in order to travel on to Greece, which conveniently did not have an extradition treaty with the United States. From there he traveled by ship to Istanbul.

Although Turkey had not ratified an extradition treaty with the United

States either, Turkish officials arrested Insull and turned him over to the US

State Department, which returned him to America. Insull avoided conviction on criminal charges but was tied up in civil litigation until his death in 1938. 24. On the Bear Stearns rescue, see Chapter 12. 25. Although only a ten-day period was covered by the list of banks published on

August 23, 1932, everyone knew that more publicity was coming, and indeed, subsequent lists were more extensive. All this is described by Butkiewicz (1995). 26. Kennedy (1973), pp. 84–85. 27. The threat is described in the account of the acting comptroller of the currency,

Francis Gloyd Awalt (Awalt 1969, p. 352). 28. In a subsequent grand jury investigation of the Union Guardian affair, Couzens was accused of having withdrawn funds just in advance of the bank holiday, motivated by inside information, and contributing to the run. His biographer argues that the allegation was unfounded. Barnard (1958), pp. 277–78. 29. Lumley (2009), p. 85.

Chapter 11 1. Data from the National Association of Realtors’ survey of 149 major markets put the peak at 2005Q4. Other home-price indices, from Case-Shiller and

Zillow, place the peak a quarter or two later, but the basic story is the same. 2. Their tales are told by Zuckerman (2009) and Lewis (2010). 3. MacDonald and Robinson (2009), pp. 268–69. 4. Selling CDOs backed by mortgages that it had taken onto the balance sheet in prior deals had the further advantage of limiting Goldman’s direct exposure to the housing market downturn. In the event, the firm had to work hard to market the resulting securities. The US Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on

Investigations (2011) concluded that Goldman had misled investors to whom it marketed these securities by claiming that the firm’s own interest in the securities was aligned with theirs. The Department of Justice disagreed or at least did not have enough evidence for charges, opting in August 2012 not to prosecute Goldman and its employees. Goldman Sachs did, however, pay $550 million to settle a civil suit brought by the Securities and Exchange

Commission. 5. Figures in the text refer to the change year over year. Again, precise numbers depend on one’s preferred housing price index, but orders of magnitude are the same. 6. See Chapter 4. 7. Bernanke (2007), p. 1. 8. Reuters (2007). 9. Thus the staff analysis of economic trends at the FOMC’s January 30–31, 2007, meeting forecast that “restraint from housing will diminish this year and that its contribution to GDP growth will turn slightly positive next year” (Board of

Governors 2013, January 30–31, 2007, transcript p. 13). At the FOMC’s March meeting several Reserve bank presidents similarly invoked the “contained” language with reference to the further repercussions of housing market weakness, though Charles Plosser of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia also acknowledged greater uncertainty surrounding that forecast. 10. CNBC Squawk Box (July 1, 2005). 11. See the secretary’s remarks to this effect on April 20, 2007, as reported in Zhou (2007). 12. Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (March 20–21, 2007), http://​ www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/minutes/20070321.htm. 13. Bernanke (2002b). 14. See Greenspan (2005). 15. Six years later the liquidators of the two Bear Stearns funds would sue the rating agencies in New York State court for having knowingly issued misleading ratings in return for fee income. 16. As it turned out, the rush for collateral was so disruptive that the creditors, who included Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America along with Merrill Lynch, found themselves unable to sell many of these assets at any price. 17. It supported the High-Grade Fund only, and not also its twin, the Enhanced

Leverage Fund. 18. Just to complete the catalog of names, in 1974, following its merger with

Deutsche Industriebank, IKB became IKB Deutsche Industriebank. 19. The definitive account of the Abacus deal is Zuckerman (2009). 20. Among the ironic aspects of the deal was that the leading shareholder in ACA, with three seats on its board, was none other than Bear Stearns, which had injected capital into the troubled firm in 2004. 21. The ACA executive responsible for the deal later testified that she had no knowledge that Paulson was a short-only investor; Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011), p. 193. The rating agencies were evidently no better at understanding. The Moody’s analyst in charge of rating Abacus testified subsequently that he had been unaware of Paulson’s involvement. He denied knowing that the program was designed to maximize the likelihood of failure.

Whatever the case, Moody’s and S&P both assigned an AAA rating to Abacus’ super-senior tranche. 22. Quoted in Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011), p. 247. 23. US District Court, Southern District of New York (2010), para. 58 et seq.

This is the SEC action referred to in note 4 above. Investors (the likes of King

County, Washington) that had lent to Rhinebridge, a second IKB special purpose vehicle, by purchasing its asset-backed commercial paper, rated AAA on the basis of its supposedly high-quality asset backing, did little better; McLean and Nocera (2010), pp. 280–81. ACA subsequently shed some of the credit risk it assumed when issuing guarantees on the Abacus deal through transactions with another European bank, ABN AMRO. But not enough: ACA itself became insolvent when its credit rating was downgraded to CCC in December 2007, forcing it to post additional collateral to back its credit default swaps. It was subsequently restructured under the supervision of the Maryland Insurance

Administration. ABN AMRO also suffered losses and was then acquired by a consortium of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland at the end of 2007. 24. New York Times (July 31, 2007, p. B2). 25. In case anyone needed reminding, the two Bear Stearns funds had formally filed for bankruptcy only days prior to the BNP announcement. 26. That said, borrowers generally prefer the interbank market to avoid the stigma of being forced into borrowing from the central bank, which is often taken as a sign of financial problems. 27. This liquidity was provided at the ECB’s refinancing rate, the main rate at which it provides credit to banks. 28. The total approaches $2 trillion when one considers commercial paper of all types, making the commercial paper market overall fully double the size of the treasury bill market. 29. If that was not worrisome enough, investors now realized that households having trouble staying current on their mortgage payments might also have trouble staying current on their credit cards and their car and student loans. 30. See Covitz, Liang, and Suarez (2009) and Kacperczyk and Schnabl (2010) for the gory details. 31. And at worst it was destructive, since the provision of insurance on bank deposits gave investors an incentive to shift out of commercial paper into accounts at insured banks. 32. Typically for two years, after which most such borrowers refinanced into a more conventional mortgage. But two years was a lifetime in the financial circumstances of the mid-2000s. 33. The Rock’s last securitization was in May, and the next one was not scheduled until September. 34. Lloyds was the consensus candidate at the time. 35. In early September Lloyds indicated that it would require an official backstop of as much as £30 billion to go through with the transaction, £30 billion being the amount of Northern Rock’s funding set to mature by 2009. The problem was that the Bank of England was not in a position to take a liability of that magnitude onto its balance sheet without a government guarantee, and the government could not go ahead without the approval of the European

Commission. 36. Irwin (2013), pp. 6–7; House of Commons Treasury Committee (2008), p. 39.

Chapter 12 1. Gorton and Metrick (2012), p. 14. The origins of Reserve Primary Fund are discussed in Chapter 4. I return to its troubles later in this chapter. 2. The AAA or AA rating in question had to be conferred by at least two nationally recognized credit rating agencies. Funds were also prohibited from holding more than 5 percent of their assets in the securities of an individual issuer. 3. See Gorton and Metrick (2012), p. 13, and McCabe (2010), pp. 28–29. 4. See Chapter 9. 5. See, for example, Clarke (1967). 6. Those swaps were initially capped at a relatively modest $24 billion, but they were soon uncapped and extended to additional central banks. 7. The criticism came later, in Paul (2008). 8. See Bullard (2013). Note, however, that the Federal Reserve Board staff’s own forecast finally turned negative, acknowledging the reality of the recession, in

April after the Bear Stearns crisis. 9. Transcript of FOMC Meeting of August 5, 2008, p. 67. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), p. 67. 10. The quote is again from St. Louis Fed President James Bullard (Board of

These quotes and citations are from the transcripts of the FOMC’s April 29–30 meeting. 13. Some authors (e.g., Sahm, Shapiro, and Slemrod 2009), moreover, argue that one-half is probably the upper bound for the share of rebate checks spent by households. 14. See Chapter 8. 15. Stephens was a longtime professor of history at the University of California,

Berkeley, and dean of its college of arts and sciences. See Stephens (1916). 16. The reference is to seasonally adjusted figures, as appropriate. 17. This refers to the slide by early March—that is, still prior to the rescue of Bear

Stearns. 18. Wessel (2009), p. 159. 19. Paulson (2010), pp. 95–96; Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011), p. 283. 20. The market in question is known as the triparty repo market. A repo, or repurchase agreement, is when one party sells a security to another with an agreement to buy it back later. The difference between the lower initial purchase price and higher repurchase price is the interest earned by the initial purchaser for providing liquidity to the seller. In a triparty repo, a custodian stands between the buyer and seller, acting as intermediary between the two. This was the role that JPMorgan Chase played for Bear Stearns. 21. See Fettig (2002). 22. Paulson (2010), pp. 100–104. 23. Eventually, Paulson discovered that Treasury lacked the power to indemnify the Fed without congressional approval and substituted a personal letter for the explicit guarantee. See Geithner (2014), p. 156. 24. Having guaranteed Bear Stearns’ trades, JPMorgan was anxious, moreover, to gain control as quickly as possible. It lacked the stomach for an extended battle with angry shareholders. 25. And then there was the fact that JPMorgan Chase had sold substantial amounts of insurance protection against Bear Stearns’ bankruptcy. The acquisition of

Bear Stearns relieved it of having to pay out on those contracts. 26. JP Morgan Chase (2009), p. 9. 27. The quote is from Reuters (2012). 28. See Chapter 10. 29. The quotation is from Bernanke (2008). 30. Similarly, it helps to explain why Fuld was reluctant to raise new capital, which would dilute existing shareholdings, including his own. 31. Plath is quoted in the Wall Street Journal, July 1, 2012, online.wsj.com, updated 3:52 p.m. 32. The details of Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch are described by

Farrell (2010). The immediate result was $22 billion of additional losses to the proud parent, announced in January 2009, which largely precipitated the second bailout of Bank of America, described below. 33. Suskind (2011), p. 43, emphasis in original. 34. Ultimately, Paulson may still have been prepared to offer a demonstration of the pragmatism for which he was known. He may have been willing to contribute to the Bank of America deal, but as an experienced negotiator he was anxious not to overpay. Holding out for the moment was a way of strengthening his bargaining position. But when his chief of staff described his position to the press as government money over my dead body, the secretary was painted into a corner; Wessel (2009), p. 15. Paulson may have been intellectually flexible and pragmatic, but he couldn’t be seen as drawing a line in the sand and immediately stepping over it. In the midst of a crisis, whether the words were his or those of his chief of staff was immaterial. 35. One indication is the transcript of the FOMC meeting in June (Board of

Governors 2014, p. 4). 36. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (2011), pp. 325–30. 37. Bernanke and Paulson pointed to the need for expanded resolution authority in a meeting with Barney Frank, but there was no willingness on Capitol Hill to take up the issue (Geithner 2014, p. 164). 38. Once Lehman was placed in bankruptcy, Barclays was able to swoop in and purchase its North American investment banking business for a modest $250 million without now also having to absorb the portfolio of toxic securities. 39. Markets in Japan, Hong Kong, and South Korea were closed for holidays. 40. Lehman’s UK bankruptcy administrator then unhelpfully responded by freezing the collateral held by the bank’s British operation to prevent those funds from leaking out of the country. Eventually, the hedge funds and others that traded through Lehman’s London arm got their money back. But not now.

They were forced in the meantime to sell other assets to raise liquidity, which created yet more problems for other investors.

Chapter 13 1. Starr continued to run the company into the 1960s. Among other things, he went on to endow the C. V. Starr East Asian Library at the University of

California, Berkeley. The most complete account of Starr’s adventures is Shelp and Ehrbar (2006). See also Stafford (1999) and Waller (2011). 2. This history is recounted by Tett (2009). 3. See Morgenson (2008), on which this section draws. 4. Boyd (2011), p. 16. 5. US House of Representatives (2009), p. 32. 6. The activities of AIG Financial Products were overseen by European regulators only when they involved the European business of Banque AIG, a French subsidiary of Financial Products. Otherwise the Europeans, in their wisdom, delegated regulation of the holding company to OTS. 7. See Chapter 12. 8. In 2009 the SEC sued the Bents for fraud, alleging they had misled their investors, regulators, and trustees by inadequately informing them of the Fund’s difficulties and leading them to believe they intended to inject additional money. In 2012 the younger Bent was found liable on one count of negligence, but he and his father were acquitted of fraud charges in what was widely viewed as a defeat for the SEC. 9. Quoted in Shifrin (2008). 10. This was reported by McCabe, Ciriani, Holscher, and Martin (2012) on the basis of confidential data. 11. The origins and rationale for Regulation Q were described in Chapter 4 and note 4 of that chapter. 12. This was not the first time Treasury had used the ESF in extremis. It had previously used it to provide emergency currency swaps and guarantees to Mexico in 1994–95 during that country’s financial crisis (Schwartz 1997). Congress responded by tightening restrictions on its use, preventing it from being applied to financing another foreign rescue. Displeased that the ESF was now being employed without explicit authorization by the legislative branch to rescue the money market industry, Congress would eventually move a second time to further limit the Treasury secretary’s latitude in making use of the fund. 13. Bloomberg News eventually resorted to the Freedom of Information Act to obtain data on borrowing under the AMLF, which it then compared with State

Street’s reported income; see Condon (2011). 14. US House of Representatives (2009), pp. 51, 62. 15. This, recall, was also the precedent that figured in the Bear Stearns rescue,

Bear having been the one bank that refused to contribute to the LTCM pool (Chapter 12). 16. It was necessary subsequently to equip the insurer with additional funds, raising the government’s stake to 92 percent. 17. The deal was criticized subsequently as not being tough enough in that the infusion of government money allowed AIG to pay off its bank counterparties, the likes of Société Générale, in full. At the same time it was criticized as too tough on the grounds that shareholders were left with only 20 percent of their previous stake in the company. Hank Greenberg filed suit against the government in US District Court for having acted unconstitutionally, expropriating shareholders, notably himself, without due process or just compensation. His suit was dismissed in 2012. 18. On selling its AIG shares and warrants, the government could claim a positive return of $23 billion. Against this must be set losses to the public sector of approximately $18 billion resulting from tax treatment allowing AIG to use its net operating losses to reduce future tax payments. 19. Paulson (2010), p. 323. 20. If four other governors were not available, it was then possible to proceed with the unanimous vote of those present.

Chapter 14 1. See also Chapter 6. 2. More precisely, they could not provide it without help from the Fed. 3. Strictly speaking, Fortis purchased only ABN AMRO’s retail businesses in the

Benelux countries, but this does nothing to change the point. The other bits were taken over by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander Group. The Royal Bank of Scotland acquired ABN AMRO’s wholesale division and Asian operations, while Santander absorbed its Brazilian and Italian businesses. 4. Greywolf eventually sued Fortis over the failure, resulting in a countersuit that detailed $400 million of losses on the deal. 5. For more on the Irish banking crisis, see Chapter 25. 6. The complete list of countries in which customers could open Kaupthing Edge accounts included also the UK, Belgium, Norway, Germany, Finland, Sweden,

Austria, and Switzerland. 7. This has been true of domestic and foreign commentators alike: see Lewis (2009), Boyes (2009), and Jónsson (2009). 8. Grímsson (2005), pp. 1, 4. 9. See Dwyer (2011) for details. 10. On this see Chapter 4. 11. This doubling was between September 2007 and March 2008. 12. The transactions described in this paragraph are analyzed by Baldursson and

Portes (2013), from where the present details are drawn. The authors effectively argue that all was well at the Icelandic banks until they were sideswiped by the crisis and then the bankers began gambling for redemption. This seems to go too far in dismissing evidence of earlier excesses. 13. Baldursson and Portes (2013), p. 10. 14. Existing equity was written down by 85 percent, giving the government a 75 percent stake (see also below, as well as note 17 to follow). 15. Its downgrade extended to a fourth financial institution, Straumur Burduras

Investment Bank. 16. To its credit, the ECB later postponed some additional margin calls on Glitnir and Landsbanki. 17. While this measure was being prepared, Oddsson and Prime Minister Geir

Haarde, Oddsson’s successor as party leader, decided in a phone call to lend €500 million to Kaupthing. Contrary to the planned €600 million loan to Glitnir, which never was paid out, this loan was. The motive for the Kaupthing loan has never been fully explained. See Sigrún Davíðsdóttir, The only secret from October 6 2008: a CBI loan of €500m to Kaupthing—updated (again) http://uti.is/2013/03/​ the-only-secret-from-october-6-2008-a-cbi-loan-of-e500m-to-kaupthing/. 18. UK deposit insurance then covered the remainder, up to a maximum of £50,000. At the time of Landsbanki’s failure some £800 million of deposit liabilities were above the limit. The UK authorities quickly concluded that, to avoid undermining confidence, these should be covered as well. After reimbursing UK and Dutch depositors, authorities in the two countries sought to recover the money from Iceland. Two bills, based on two agreements, were passed in the Icelandic Parliament authorizing the government to guarantee full repayment up to the EU maximum. In both cases, the president subjected those agreements to public referenda, and in both cases they were defeated. In January 2009, the Court of the European Free Trade Area ruled that the Icelandic government was not obliged to reimburse the two governments. In 2014 the Dutch and British governments, not easily deterred, sued the Icelandic deposit insurance fund, as distinct from the government, in yet another attempt to recover their costs. The quest would seem quixotic, given that the interest and principal sought by the Dutch and

British governments approached $9 billion, or nearly 60 percent of Icelandic

GDP, and the deposit insurance fund had only $300 million in assets. 19. Quoted in an interview in the Wall Street Journal (2008). 20. The individual signs varied, but the message was universally the same.

Chapter 15 1. Oliver and Marion (2010), p. 95. 2. Chicago’s crisis was precipitated by a strike by the Association of Real Estate

Taxpayers, which slowed collection of property taxes. The association, which had the populist trapping of suffering working-class homeowners, was in fact a collection of large property owners. The city’s consequent inability to pay interest on its municipal bonds, many of which were held by local banks, in turn contributed to the banking crisis that is described in Chapter 10. Cermak’s response was to jawbone the banks, including Charles Dawes’ Central Republic

Trust, to buy additional bonds and to ask the RFC to accept them as collateral in return for loans. 3. Counts vary since some states declared holidays more than once, individual banks sometimes self-declared holidays, some holidays were municipal rather than statewide, and other holidays were limited to parts of states. 4. As he stated in a handwritten appeal delivered to FDR by a Secret Service agent during a banquet at the Hotel Astor in New York on February 18. Hoover had previously attempted to contact Roosevelt directly but was told that he was on a fishing trip on Mr. Astor’s yacht. Roosevelt later claimed his failure to respond before March 1 was caused by a secretarial error. 5. A useful summary, if one can get past political overtones, is Best (1991). A subtler one is Moley (1966). 6. See Chapter 1. The contrast with 2009–10, when progressives focused on breaking up big banks rather than big manufacturing companies, reflects the fact that banks in 1933, though sometimes big and often suspect, were limited by anti-branching laws. The banks would receive their own Brandeisian comeuppance with the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act. 7. This made it all the more remarkable that the Supreme Court, under Brandeis’ leadership, rejected the NIRA as unconstitutional two years later (see below). 8. New York Times (December 31, 1933, p. 2). In Keynes’ words, “NRA, which is essentially reform and probably impedes recovery, has been put across too hastily, in the false guise of being part of the technique of recovery.” In his

January 1935 annual message to Congress, FDR retorted, “The attempt to make a distinction between recovery and reform is a narrowly conceived effort to substitute the appearance of reality for reality itself. When a man is convalescing from illness, wisdom dictates not only cure of the symptoms, but also removal of their cause.” Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Annual Message to Congress,”

January 4, 1935, online in Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American

Presidency Project, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14890. 9. One may think of this as a pre-Galbraithian expression of the notion of countervailing power as later expressed in Galbraith (1952). 10. Like Barack Obama’s first treasury secretary, Woodin served previously on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That the Senate Banking

Committee subsequently found Woodin’s name on a list of J. P. Morgan’s preferred customers and showed that he had received preferred stock options, something for which he was criticized by Huey Long, may have hastened his departure (see below), as did FDR’s decision to abandon the gold standard.

Woodin also shared with that earlier cabinet member, Charles Dawes, a love for music (Chapter 3); his “Franklin D. Roosevelt March” was played at the inauguration. When in the spring of 1933 maintenance of the gold standard became controversial within the administration, he composed a sonnet entitled “Lullaby to Silver.” 11. His famous debt-deflation article was Fisher (1933). To address this problem,

Fisher offered a compensated dollar, in which the government would raise the dollar price of gold by 1 percent for every 1 percent fall in the price level; this then delivered intellectual cover for the gold-buying program initiated in October. The compensated-dollar plan was inspired by William Jennings

Bryan’s 1896 presidential campaign, as described in Fisher (1911). Though he did not advise FDR, Fisher collaborated with the Committee for the Nation, a group of bankers and businessmen organized by Frank Vanderlip, former president of National City Bank, that lobbied for stabilizing the price level (Bratter 1941). As consultant to the committee, Warren was exposed to Fisher’s ideas. 12. So in effect did a group of economists at the University of Chicago, whose “Chicago Plan” was submitted to Agriculture Secretary Henry Wallace in

March. It proposed allowing banks to reopen after the bank holiday under control of the Federal Reserve System, after which they would be converted into “full reserve” or “100 percent reserve” banks permitted to invest only in safe assets. For the post–Great Recession analog, see Kotlikoff (2010). Alter (2010) describes a private dinner at the White House in April 2009 in which

Krugman and Stiglitz backed nationalization. 13. The quotation is from FDR’s first inaugural address, available at http://www.​ inaugural.senate.gov/swearing-in/address/address-by-franklin-d-roosevelt-1933. 14. Mills was a Republican but also a Harvard classmate of Roosevelt. Arthur

Ballantine—as noted in Chapter 10—was yet another classmate. 15. This had also been recommended to FDR by Rene Leon, an advisor to the

House Banking and Currency Committee. Roosevelt then sent Tugwell to Washington, where he traced the only extant copy of the act to the Accounts and Deposits Division of the Treasury Department. He found that the relevant clause was underlined in red, indicating that Hoover had already considered this option (Hitzik 2011, p. 39). 16. It was seven pages rather than three. House Banking Committee Chair Henry

Steagall did the reading. Carter Glass subsequently provided an abridged reading to the Senate, although by the time it took up the bill, multiple copies were made available by the Government Printing Office. 17. See Moley (1966), p. 144; Henry (1960), pp. 347–48. 18. The Treasury wanted the Federal Reserve System to approve the reopened banks, whereas the Federal Reserve wanted Treasury to assume this responsibility. In the end they split the difference: Reserve banks and other regulators provided recommendations and solvent banks were then reopened with certification by the Treasury. 19. New York Times (March 14, 1933, p. 1). 20. Moley (1939), p. 155. 21. The banks remained reluctant to ask for government help, recalling the embarrassment they suffered when a list of RFC-supported institutions was published in January. Jones’ response to the worry that banks accepting public capital would be singled out was to insist that all banks should apply for RFC assistance. Speaking to the American Bankers Association in Chicago, he warned the bankers to apply for RFC assistance or else. One is reminded of the reluctance of the leading US banks to borrow from the TARP and the do-so-or-else posture adopted by Treasury Secretary Paulson and New York Fed President

Geithner. Beginning with Manufacturers Trust, they now did so. By the middle of 1935, the RFC had purchased some $1.3 billion of stock and capital notes in nearly seven thousand banks. 22. Beard and Smith (1940), p. 78. 23. Norris (1937), pp. 232–33. 24. Nadler and Bogen (1933), p. 174; Silber (2009), p. 25. 25. Paul de Grauwe is the main exponent of the view that the explosion of sovereign spreads in Europe in 2011–12 was panic-driven, in parallel with the run on US banks in 1933. See De Grauwe and Ji (2013). OMT is described in

Chapter 26. 26. This is the view of Eggertsson (2008). 27. Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Message to Congress on Economies in Government,”

March 10, 1933, online in Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American

Presidency Project, http://www.presidency.ucsb.​edu/ws/index.php?pid=14496. 28. See Chapter 23. 29. The quote from Douglas is from an article on his appointment in the New York

Times of March 19, 1933, p. SM3. The same Lewis Douglas would declare a month later, when Roosevelt announced his intention of abandoning the gold standard, that this marked the end of Western civilization. 30. Aside from $150 million of incidental revenue from new taxes on beer and wine, which would take some time to accrue. 31. Note the parallel with the 8½ percent cuts under the so-called Sequester in 2013. 32. MacArthur exceeded his orders, President Hoover having instructed him to move the protesters out of Washington, D.C.’s central business district, but no matter. Hoover upbraided MacArthur only privately, and the press blamed the president for the incident. 33. Roosevelt’s deficits in fiscal years 1934 and 1936 ended up being larger than

Hoover’s in 1932 and 1933. But those deficits were larger by only a small margin; the increase in tax receipts as the economy recovered limited their growth.

And with Prohibition now history, the excise tax on alcohol added as much as 15 percent to revenues. 34. Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Annual Message to Congress,” January 4, 1935, online in Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The American Presidency Project, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14890. 35. Roosevelt had already vetoed a bill paying out the bonus once. Congress overrode his second veto in January 1936. 36. Economists of a variety of persuasions have reached this conclusion (Brown 1956, Peppers 1973, Romer 1992). Given Professor Romer’s subsequent position in the Obama administration, this analysis had some influence in shaping the 2009 stimulus (Chapter 20). 37. New York Times (March 6, 1933, p. 1). Woodin was also a collector of gold coins, explaining why, when a month later he was instructed to issue to an executive order requiring gold coin, bullion, and certificates to be handed over to the government, he exempted rare and unusual coins. 38. McKenney (1939), quoted in Leuchtenburg (1968), p. 21. 39. This according to the Federal Reserve Board’s index. 40. See Chapter 10. 41. New York Times (April 20, 1933, p. 1). The dollar, meanwhile, sank by 11½ percent against the currencies of countries still on gold, reflecting the expectation that US prices were set to rise. 42. Barnard (1958), pp. 272–73. 43. Warburg (1964), p. 128. James Warburg, son of the German-American financier Paul Warburg, sometimes referred to as the father of the Federal Reserve

System, was in London as financial advisor to the US delegation. 44. See Chapter 10. 45. See, for example, coverage by BBC News in Schifferes (2009). British Prime

Minister Gordon Brown describes in his memoirs (Brown 2010) how his efforts to organize an internationally coordinated response to the Great Recession (the UK chairing the G20 at the time) were informed by the collapse of the 1933 conference. For more, see Chapter 24. H. G. Wells, having found in Montagu Norman one irresistible target for ridicule, found the London Conference to be another, asking in The Shape of Things to Come “How could men appointed as national representatives accept a pooling of national interests? They were indeed fully prepared to revolutionize the world situation and change gathering misery to hope, plenty and order, but only on the impossible condition that they were not to change themselves and that nothing essential to their importance changed” (p. 131). 46. FDR offered Herriot, during the latter’s visit to Washington, D.C., an international agreement under whose terms governments would keep their exchange rates stable but reflate in tandem. The French rejected the offer as inflationary and damaging to confidence (Nichols 1951). 47. That this approach complicated cooperation on other matters was unfortunate but unavoidable. Kennedy, following Hoover, argues that Hitler inferred from the collapse of the conference that the United States was not prepared to play a role in Europe, that “the Western powers had. . . little stomach for concerted action in the face of danger,” and that he could do pretty much as he pleased without fear of American reprisal (Kennedy 1999, p. 155). 48. Jones (1951), p. 249. 49. Keynes also offered a third option: an agreement with other countries to stabilize exchange rates but extended to include agreement on joint measures to stabilize price levels. This, however, was not practical, what with important players like France still on the gold standard (see below) and given the bad taste left by the failure of the World Economic Conference. 50. On January 15 the administration sent Congress legislation authorizing the president to lower the gold content of the dollar to 50–60 percent of its previous level. On January 16 the Federal Reserve took over responsibility for executing the gold-purchase program from the RFC. On January 30 Congress then gave the president the authority he required. The next day FDR used it to fix the price of gold at $35 an ounce. 51. Some observers have been critical of the tactics and also the strategy, questioning whether devaluing the dollar and pushing up the price of gold could stabilize the price level. (One is reminded of skepticism about the effectiveness of quantitative easing by central banks in response to the Great Recession.)

They point to the fact that there was no one-for-one response of commodity prices to changes in the gold-purchase price (see viz. Kennedy 1999). After jumping up in April, commodity prices fell back in late 1933. But standard models suggest that prices move on expectations of future policy rather than on its implementation. They suggest that when commodity prices are flexible while the prices of labor services are sticky, the flexible prices will overshoot initially and give back some of that ground subsequently (Frankel 1986). US evidence from 1933 is consistent with this view (Temin and Wigmore 1990). 52. French prime minister Charles de Gaulle, or more precisely his finance minister

Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, coined the phrase in the 1960s when critiquing the dollar’s asymmetric role in the post–World War II Bretton Woods System.

Chapter 16 1. Wallace did not see these as alternatives; in addition to technical improvements and crop set-asides he advocated monetary measures in response to farm problems (Shapsmeier and Shapsmeier 1968). The specifics of the set-aside program owed much to the “allotment plan” of Professor M. L. Wilson of

Montana State College. Wilson was an advocate of incentives to increase efficiency in the 1920s, but in response to the slow pace of efficiency improvement he gravitated toward the allotment scheme (Rowley 1969). Rex Tugwell discovered Wilson during the 1932 campaign, when he was delegated to attend a meeting sponsored by the Giannini Foundation for Agricultural

Economics. 2. As we saw in Chapter 1. The same remained the case in the 1930s; see Field (2011). 3. “Message to Congress Recommending Enactment of the National Industrial

Recovery Act” (May 17, 1933), online in Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley, The

American Presidency Project, www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=14646. 4. The work in question was Berle and Means (1933). 5. Some historians, invoking the example of Henry Ford and the five-dollar day, suggest that higher wages may have helped by stimulating consumer spending.

But it is hard to build a consistent model in which this positive effect of the

NIRA outweighed the negative effects. Ford himself was a die-hard opponent of the act. 6. All this is described in more detail in Sumner (1990). 7. See Weinstein (1980); Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 495, citing Roose (1954); and Cole and Ohanian (2004). 8. On this, see Wecter (1948). 9. The reference is to Anderson (2000). 10. Chicago Tribune (May 29, 1935, p. 12). 11. The act combined railway pensions into a single pooled fund, something the

Court rejected on the grounds that some railways had previously contributed more to their pension schemes than others. 12. Thus the court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act in United States v. Darby

Lumber Co., and upheld a Washington State minimum-wage law, reversing a previous decision regarding New York State’s minimum wage. 13. The new entity was initially known as the Federal Bank Deposit Insurance

Corporation, or FBDIC, but the name was quickly shortened to FDIC.

Glass-Steagall also permitted statewide branching except in states where it was expressly prohibited. Previously, only twelve states had permitted statewide branching, four of which passed legislation permitting it in anticipation of Glass-Steagall. Another dozen permitted more limited branching. Glass, his views colored by the experience of the 1920s, concluded that unit banking was incompatible with financial stability. It is interesting to observe that the perceived threat to stability in 1933 was fragmentation, the opposite of 2010, when concentration and size—too big to fail and too complex to manage—were the overriding problems. 14. New York Times (June 16, 1933, p. 14). The campaign continued even after passage. On June 27, at its annual convention at Lake George, New York, the State

Bankers’ Association condemned the provisions of Glass-Steagall designed to facilitate statewide branching and adopted a resolution urging repeal or modification of the act. 15. The committee had been investigating the stock market crash and surrounding events since April 1932 under two earlier, ineffectual chief counsels before

Pecora took over in January 1933. 16. On Paulson, see Chapter 11. The “friends of Angelo” program is described in

US House of Representatives (2009). 17. Aldrich was the son of Nelson Aldrich, the Rhode Island senator (1881–1911) who had helped to found the Federal Reserve System. 18. In addition, the big banks lobbying for federal deposit insurance understood that extension of a deposit-insurance guarantee was less likely so long as insured deposits were seen as funding the risky activities of investment banks. Dividing the financial system into “risky” investment banks and relatively “safe” commercial banks was thus a way of strengthening the case for deposit insurance (more on which below). 19. Katznelson (2013), p. 124. 20. Finally, it has been suggested that Glass-Steagall was a Faustian bargain between large and small banks. The large banks got permission to branch, while the small banks, which had long experienced confidence problems owing to their regionally and economically concentrated portfolios, received deposit guarantees. The problem with this story is that, as we saw above, small banks were far from united in favoring deposit insurance. In many cases, the associations representing them were opposed. The heterogeneity of views among small rural banks is similarly emphasized by Keeton (1990). 21. This is ultimately the explanation for the adoption of deposit insurance in

Calomiris and White (1994). 22. These measures were known as blue-sky laws, reflecting complaints that dishonest financial promoters had been selling securities “backed by nothing more than the clear blue sky.” 23. Subsequently, use of the Martin Act was strengthened. It was invoked by

Eliot Spitzer in order to oust AIG CEO Hank Greenberg, and by his successor, Eric Schneiderman, to extract sue JPMorgan for defrauding purchasers of mortgage-related securities from Bear Stearns—the same lawsuits of which

Jamie Dimon so bitterly complained (see Chapter 12). 24. Seligman (1982), p. 49. 25. Brandeis (1914), p. 62. 26. Initially that agency was to be the Federal Trade Commission, reflecting the extent to which blue-sky laws were evaded by interstate sales through the mail.

Even earlier Samuel Untermeyer, a longtime securities crusader and counsel to the Pujo Committee, the pre–World War I predecessor of the Pecora

Commission, recommended vesting this power with the Post Office (the mails being used, as noted above, to circumvent blue-sky laws). Only in 1934 did opinion coalesce around establishing a self-standing agency, the Securities and

Exchange Commission. 27. Figures for 2005 and 2010 refer to single-family units; from the National

Association of Home Builders. 28. Calder’s advocacy of federal aid for housing, which would have resonated with the advocates of the federal government’s “affordable housing goals” eighty years later, did not however prevent his being defeated in a reelection bid in 1922. 29. In a further concession to straitened times, they gave borrowers the option of paying interest only for the first three years. In the 1920s, home mortgages typically had a maturity of just five years. Borrowers were required to make just interest payments, with a balloon payment of principal at the end. In some cases, building and loan associations offered share accumulation contracts that amortized over time and ran for ten or twelve years, but these were a minority of mortgages (Fishback, Rose, and Snowden 2013). HOLC mortgages, in contrast, were amortized over the life of the loan, eliminating the need for balloon payments at the end. 30. If appraisals were much lower than the encumbrance, then a principal reduction was offered, but only if the lender agreed to incur a corresponding loss when receiving payment from the HOLC. Rose (2011) shows that these principal reductions occurred in a minority of cases, in which they averaged 8 percent. In practice, appraisals were often inflated in order to encourage lender participation. 31. To qualify for a HOLC loan, borrowers first had to establish that they were capable of fulfilling the terms. In addition, they had to establish that they had been unable to refinance with a private lender. Some borrowers nonetheless fell behind, leading the HOLC to foreclose on 20 percent of its loans. But with home prices falling only modestly in the second half of the 1930s, HOLC loans were effectively overcollateralized, limiting the corporation’s losses. Losses were not eliminated entirely: Fishback et al. (2011) report that the HOLC realized an average loss of 33 percent on every foreclosed home it sold. 32. The fact that the share of mortgage debt was greater than the share of mortgages tells us that its work disproportionately benefited middleand upper-class homeowners. 33. See Courtmanche and Snowden (2011) and Fishback, Flores-Lagunes, Horrace,

Kantor, and Treber (2011). A majority of US states adopted moratoria on foreclosures in the 1930s, but such moratoria were temporary; as such they were unlikely to do much to encourage construction. 34. Fishback et al. (2011) consider the earnings paid to the Treasury by the HOLC, the costs to the Treasury of supplying funds to the HOLC, and the increase in the corporation’s balance sheet, and conclude that costs were on the order of $100 million. In 1951 dollars, that being the year the HOLC was wound up, $100 million is the equivalent of $1 billion today. The 2009 federal budget, for comparison, was $3.1 trillion. 35. Fishback, Rose, and Snowden (2013) conclude that home prices were 16 percent higher than otherwise in the typical small community as a result of the intervention of the HOLC.

Chapter 17 1. As described in Chapter 2. 2. A good statement of the new monetary framework is Bernanke, Laubach,

Mishkin, and Posen (1999). 3. See Chapter 12. 4. The Bank of Taiwan was a Japanese bank with responsibilities for the governance of Taiwan. 5. Policy makers had debated the possibility in 1923 and again in 1927, but other imperatives dominated on both occasions. 6. Inoue, not incidentally, was a former governor of the bank. 7. As described in Chapter 10. 8. The list of banks in the lead in speculating against the yen is from Takahashi’s biographer, Smethurst (2007), p. 251. 9. He did so on his first day in office. It then took three days for the Privy Council, which advised the new prime minister, Tsuyoshi Inukai, to validate his decision. 10. For details see Shima (1983). 11. Those other central bankers anticipated that the bank could eventually sell government bonds into the market, using these open market operations to mop up the increase in the money supply. Eventually the central bank did engage in some such sales, although the sales had a hard time keeping pace with the purchases. See Ide (2003). 12. Smethurst (2007), p. 250. 13. See Chapter 15. 14. There is thus some irony in the fact that Takahashi, who opposed the country’s overseas military adventures, was ultimately assassinated by military officers (see below). The young Takahashi sought to continue his studies in the United States with the aid of an American businessman who promised to help him with arrangements in California. On arriving, he found that he was essentially an indentured servant forced to work as a houseboy to repay his costs of transportation. One can imagine that this experience nonetheless had positive implications for his English-language skills. 15. Nanto and Takagi (1985), p. 372. 16. After a recession in 1934, the impressive growth of the economy resumed, and continued for the remainder of the 1930s. Figures here are from the Maddison database (http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.​htm). 17. When it became evident that no such agreement would be forthcoming, he pushed for forming a currency bloc with the Commonwealth and Empire whose common exchange rate would be fixed but adjustable against gold.

Howson (1975), pp. 84–85; Morrison (2013), pp. 33–34. Eventually a sterling bloc did form, as members of the Commonwealth and Empire followed sterling down against the dollar and then pegged to the pound at its new lower level. 18. The new chancellor also oversaw the imposition of the Chamberlain family nostrum: a 33 percent across-the-board tariff on imports. 19. Rock (1969), p. 86. 20. Howson (1980), p. 48. 21. These are the figures for the M3 money supply from Capie and Weber (1985). 22. The UK solidified this achievement through a large-scale war debt conversion in 1932, where it converted its earlier high-interest-rate-bearing bonds into new issues bearing a 2 percent rate. What was true of Britain was similarly true of other members of the Commonwealth and sterling area that followed

Britain off gold (as described below). Crafts (2013) estimates that this group of countries was able to reduce the real interest rate on its debt from more than 5 percent in the late 1920s to just 2 percent in the early 1930s. The contrast with the policies of the Cameron government starting in 2010 and across the

Eurozone (see Chapters 24 and 26)—and the less than fully supportive policies of the ECB—will be obvious. 23. This is a point made by Urban (2009). Ragnar Nurkse (1944), in his classic account of interwar currency experience, similarly comments on the stability of exchange rates within the sterling area and the willingness of governments to sacrifice their monetary autonomy in pursuit of this supposed higher objective. 24. Wicksell first gave a presentation to this effect to the Swedish Economic

Association in 1898. See Berg and Jonung (1998) for an account that emphasizes the influence of these economists. 25. On the Kreuger crisis, see Chapter 9. The discount from the 1929 rate against sterling was in fact relatively modest, on the order of 6 percent. 26. This argument is developed by Straumann and Woitek (2009). Similarly, modern scholarship has not been kind to the notion that Swedish policy makers pursued Keynesian fiscal policies before Keynes (as argued by Thomas 1937). 27. Venezuela was the one country that instead floated the exchange rate throughout the period, its currency and economy being buoyed by strong oil exports (McBeth 1983). 28. Argentina, which still relied heavily on the British market for its beef exports, was an exception. It therefore continued to service its debt, pegged the peso to sterling, and negotiated an agreement to ensure access to the UK market (the

Roca-Runciman Treaty, named after the vice president of Argentina and the president of the British Board of Trade). See Diaz-Alejandro (1970). 29. This is part of the explanation for how Latin American countries succeeded in regaining 1929 levels of output as early as 1932–33 (agricultural production being maintained during the Depression), although there is no denying that the policy choices described here also played a role (on these see Campa 1990). 30. Fishlow (1972) is the classic account of import substitution in Latin America in this period. 31. The same was true of the other countries of Central and Eastern Europe that had previously experienced high inflation and now imposed exchange controls. They too remained reluctant to use their newfound monetary room for maneuver to expand their money supplies and counter deflation (Mitchener and

Wandschneider 2013). 32. Cited in Ritschl (2000), p. 1. Because spending on the military-industrial complex was capital-intensive, it created even less employment than otherwise.

Autobahn construction, being more labor-intensive, was different but made a significant contribution only in 1935. 33. Under Obama, recall for sake of comparison, the deficit of the federal government rose from 3 percent of GDP in 2008 to 10 percent in 2009. 34. Kindleberger (1989), p. 179. 35. Even countries that went off the gold standard resorted to tariffs when recovery proved disappointing. Thus Britain not only devalued but also imposed a general tariff in February 1932 (see above) and negotiated the Ottawa

Agreements with the Commonwealth and Empire. Failure of the Bank of

England to cut interest rates more quickly and the lag before the British economy reacted go a long way toward explaining this otherwise peculiar response. 36. An introduction to the literature on tariffs and economic performance over the long run is Broadberry and Crafts (2010). Indeed, some see the origins of the contemporary European Union in the trading bloc constructed by Germany in the 1930s and solidified during World War II, this being the controversial conclusion of Wolf and Ritschl (2011). 37. Later, the Third Reich was able to use an intensified version of the system to extract raw materials and industrial resources from the Central and Western

European countries that came under its wartime control.

Chapter 18 1. This is the change in real GDP between 1933Q2 and 1937Q2, according to

Balke and Gordon (1986), p. 804. Industrial production figures are from Miron and Romer (1990). 2. The figure is 9 percent if individuals on public work relief are counted as employed. 3. Cited in Warren (1996), p. 66. 4. Senator Huey Long, arguably an even stronger populist challenger, was assassinated in September 1935. Coughlin’s Union Party eventually nominated as its presidential candidate William Lemke, a nondescript congressman from North

Dakota, who ended up drawing only a small fraction of the vote. For more on

Coughlin, see Chapter 10. 5. For the evidence on firm behavior see Calomiris and Hubbard (1995). The argument for high-return investment projects is made by Field (2011); see also

Chapter 1. 6. Eccles had a hand in a number of other consequential initiatives of this period; for example, his letter to Senator Patton Harrison of Mississippi planted the idea of the undistributed profits tax. 7. Previously, the board could change reserve requirements only after declaring an emergency and with the consent of the president. 8. FDR nominated Eccles in November 1934, in advance of the Banking Act of 1935, but Eccles made FDR’s support for the legislation a condition for accepting (Hyman 1976, p. 159). The president then renominated him as chairman of the reorganized board of governors when the Banking Act became effective in

February 1936. 9. Eccles (1951), pp. 56–61. Either that or Eccles patterned his account of the events of 1931 after those in the movie. 10. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934, passed once FDR stabilized the price of gold, established a $2 billion Exchange Stabilization Fund using the profits from devaluation and authorized the secretary of the Treasury, acting with the approval of the president, to use it to purchase and sell government securities on the market. It was this power to counter central bank policy that the Fed now sought to override. This was the same ESF that the US Treasury under

Henry Paulson used to guarantee accounts at money market mutual funds in

September 2008 (Chapter 13). 11. Friedman and Schwartz (1963), p. 526. 12. See Cargill and Mayer (2006). A subsequent study by Park and Van Horn (2013) using disaggregated data reaches the same conclusion. 13. See Calomiris, Mason, and Wheelock (2011). 14. Hyman (1976), p. 216. As Eccles wrote retrospectively, in 1951, “This decision was in the nature of a precautionary measure. It in no way reversed the Board’s easy-money and credit policies. . . . That the $1,790,000,000 in excess reserves which was siphoned off merely eliminated what was superfluous to the needs of commerce, industry, and agriculture was shown by subsequent events. Reserves were still so large and so well-spaced that all but a few member banks met the

August 15 order either by utilizing their excess reserve balances with the Reserve banks or by drawing upon their excess balances with our correspondent banks.

Moreover, the change had no effect on the credit situation.” Eccles (1951), p. 290. 15. Standard practice was to pay for the gold purchased by printing gold certificates equal to the value of the purchase and depositing them at the Federal Reserve, where they could be used as bank reserves. Instead, Treasury now kept the certificates in an inactive account where they could not be used to back expansion of credit. 16. The monetary base was fully 10 percent lower in 1937 than would have been the case in the absence of the downturn. See Irwin (2012), on which this discussion draws. 17. From this point it used gold acquired the previous year to finance additional injections of money and credit. 18. For two cases in point see Romer (2009b) and Crafts and Fearon (2010). 19. Earlier the candidate provocatively asserted that he welcomed the hatred of business. The “hatred” comment was in an October 31 speech at Madison

Square Garden announcing the Second New Deal (http://docs.fdrlibrary.​marist. edu/od2ndst.html). The “economic royalists” phrase was then from his 1937 inaugural address. 20. See Higgs (1997), as channeled by Boudreaux (2011). 21. Higgs (1997), p. 577. The survey in question was conducted in the spring of 1939. 22. Here Higgs (1997, p. 584) is echoing contemporaries like Ogden Mills, who complained in 1936 how “we cannot have a full recovery so long as the

Administration seeks to transform America into a collectivist state” (Mills 1936, p. 65). 23. Economists refer to this as the tendency for the term structure of interest rates to steepen (for long-term rates to rise relative to short-term rates) during a recovery and to “invert” (for long rates to fall below the level of short rates) with the approach of a recession. 24. Although employment was also growing, as a percentage of employed workers the increase was proportionally only slightly smaller (8.5 percent versus 15.1 percent). See Mayer (2004), appendix table A1. 25. Sales were then again lower in 1938. The geography is also right, as Hausman shows: the largest proportional fall in manufacturing employment was in the Upper Midwest, and of all states Michigan experienced the single largest decline. Hausman (2012) is the source of this information. 26. As Mouré (1991, p. 197) describes, Reynaud later claimed that his conversion occurred as early as 1933, but there is little evidence to this effect. Mouré also shows that Reynaud’s claims that his advocacy of franc devaluation was entirely unprecedented was similarly an exaggeration. 27. Reynaud became a political outcast until vindicated by subsequent events. He would become Edouard Daladier’s minister of finance in 1938—that is, following the devaluation that vindicated his views. After refusing to participate in the

Vichy government in 1940, Reynaud was arrested, transferred to Germany, and held there, like his countryman Léon Blum, until the conclusion of World War II. 28. In the bank’s annual report for 1935. 29. In addition, the Bank of France now paid out mainly gold bars, not coin, where the cost of a bar was 216,000 francs. This prevented small savers from running on its reserve, although there were reports of tradesmen pooling their resources to secure a bar and then cutting it up. 30. Reflecting the existence of this pastoral safety net, France did less than

Britain in providing unemployment insurance and public work relief. Indeed it did not even bother to gather comprehensive statistics on the unemployed. 31. This on July 17, 1933. Further channeling FDR, Laval also formed a “Brains

Trust” to advise him on economic policies, made up of Raoul Dautry, the director of the state railways; Claude-Joseph Gignoux, editor of La Journée Industrielle; and Jacques Rueff, the ultra-orthodox economist who advised every French prime minister from Raymond Poincaré to Charles de Gaulle. The Communist opposition referred to this as the “brain of trusts” (Jackson 1985, p. 105). 32. As translated by Warner (1968), p. 90. 33. Earlier they had signed a “Unity of Action Pact” in order to form a united front against far-right antiparliamentary forces, which gained prominence starting in 1934. 34. In addition, like FDR three years before, Blum and his allies advocated a reduction in the length of the workweek, measures intended to aid suffering farmers by raising agricultural prices, and tax reform designed to increase the progressivity of the tax system. 35. Cited in Lacouture (1982), p. 362. 36. Shamir (1989), pp. 219–22. Emmanuel Mönick, the French financial attaché in

London, played an important role in convincing Blum that exchange control would lead France down the “German path,” making it difficult to collaborate with other democratic governments. 37. Details are in Roselli (2006).

Chapter 19 1. Between 1929 and 1932 the fall was almost exactly the same in the advanced countries and the world as a whole. Data from the Maddison database (http://​ www.ggdc.net/maddison/maddison-project/home.htm) show GDP in the advanced countries falling by a cumulative one percentage point less than global GDP between 1929 and 1932. The fall in global GDP between 2008 and 2009 was 0.4 percentage point, according to the April 2014 edition of the

IMF’s World Economic Outlook database (http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/​ ft/weo/2014/01/weodata/index.aspx). 2. The WTO dated from 1995. Its influence was reinforced by—some would say that whatever influence it possessed in fact derived from—the growth of multinational companies and global supply chains that gave business a powerful interest in free and open trade. 3. http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/11/15/open-letter-to-ben-bernanke/. 4. See Chapter 26. 5. The Democrats took control of both houses in the 2006 midterm elections but faced a Republican-controlled White House. In addition to securing the White

House, they now extended their majorities in the House and Senate. 6. The $20 billion was known as the first-loss tranche; it would compensate the borrowers for their first $20 billion of losses. 7. Starting in 1937 and extending through World War II, the New York rate was then lowered to 1 percent. 8. See Chapter 13. 9. Paulson (2010), p. 323. 10. Wessel (2009), pp. 237–40; Suskind (2011), pp. 122–23; Irwin (2013), p. 157. 11. In addition he received warrants enabling him to purchase a further $5 billion of common stock with a strike price of $115. With the warrants set to expire at the end of 2013, Goldman shares were trading at around $150. 12. Following Buffett’s lead, Treasury also demanded warrants to purchase common stock in qualifying banks in an amount equal to 15 percent of the preferred equity infusion. The warrants were designed to give taxpayers a share in the returns if and when the banking system eventually recovered, but no voting rights were to be assigned to the Treasury. 13. Quoted in Zingales (2009), p. 73. Phillip Swagel, Paulson’s chief economist, speaks of Treasury’s “chronic disorganization” and of a “haphazard policy process within the administration” (Swagel 2009, p. 5). 14. Congress valued the approach in part because it meant that a significant share of mortgage-backed securities held by the banks would end up in the hands of the government, making it easier to restructure the underlying mortgages. 15. Paulson (2010), pp. 406–8. 16. Ibid., p. 413. 17. The government received another $7 billion in preferred shares as its fee for the guarantee, plus warrants as in the earlier round of capital injections. 18. Swagel (2009), p. 3. 19. The government ended up officially with a positive return on its investment (Congressional Budget Office 2009). But see also Barofsky (2012), who questions whether the TARP accounts, and by implication CBO reports based on them, provide a full and proper accounting of the costs incurred by the government.

Chapter 20 1. Suskind (2011), p. 212. 2. See Chapter 15, note 12. 3. In the case of bank loans, the scheme foresaw the Federal Deposit Insurance

Corporation as overseeing the part of the program where banks sold bundles of mortgages to the highest bidder. 4. The only difference was that the guarantee was implicit: although Treasury would lend up to 85 percent of the purchase price, the loan would be “nonrecourse,” meaning the government would recover only the residual value of the assets. 5. In addition, there was room for discretion when it came to deciding how much additional capital over and above the implied minimum the banks would be required to hold. See Bair (2012), p. 160, for a critical assessment. 6. Or more precisely, just in advance of their release, the key findings having been leaked to the markets. 7. As she put it in a speech at the Brookings Institution delivered during Obama’s second month in office, “One crucial lesson from the 1930s is that a small fiscal expansion has only small effects.” The research in question is Romer (1992), while the March 2009 speech is Romer (2009a). 8. This in the words of Murray and Kane (2009). 9. Actually, they chose a value from the upper end of the range of estimated multipliers on the grounds that the Fed would take steps to prevent interest rates from rising and crowding out private spending. This in turn had the effect of biasing downward their bottom-line estimate of needed stimulus spending. 10. Geithner (2014), p. 259. 11. CBO used the forecasting models of the Federal Reserve and two economic consulting firms, Macroeconomic Advisors and Global Insight. The office noted how it had “altered the models’ usual formulation to reduce the extent to which interest rates respond to increases in output”—in line with evidence of no response of interest rates—which worked to produce larger counterfactual changes than otherwise (Congressional Budget Office 2010, p. 10). 12. Compare Obama’s declaration in a radio address ten days before his inauguration that the stimulus would “likely save or create three million to four million jobs.” Transcript at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?​pid=85391& st=jobs&st1=#axzz1OPNVsvHl. Three to four million jobs is a goodly number in an economy with, at this time, approximately 140 million employed people, both fulland part-time. The unemployment rate for its part was estimated by

CBO to be from 0.7 to 1.8 percentage points lower. 13. See Blanchard and Leigh (2013). Their exercise relied on the variation in growth rates, actual and forecast, and forecasts of changes in fiscal policy for European countries. 14. The first study is Feyrer and Sacerdote (2011), while the second is

Chodorow-Reich, Feiveson, Liscow, and Woolston (2012). The problem with cross-state comparisons is that states hit hardest by the recession could have received disproportionate amounts of additional federal funding. If they had more scope to then recover from the slump, simple correlations would erroneously credit the stimulus for this bounce-back effect. Feyrer and Sacerdote adjust for this by considering only the portion of matching funds that can be explained by the seniority of the state’s House delegation (that is explainable on political as opposed to contemporaneous economic grounds). Chodorow-Reich et al. consider only the increase in Medicaid assistance that can be explained by the pattern of pre-recession Medicaid spending.

Chapter 21 1. Such statements were known as forward guidance or, more familiarly, as “open mouth operations,” to distinguish them from the central bank’s conventional open market operations. 2. In Bernanke and Mishkin (1997) and Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin, and Posen (1999). 3. Others suggested that the Fed should instead target a 5 percent rate of increase of nominal GDP, which would commit it to generating more inflation when growth was weak and less when the economy was growing strongly. But a nominal GDP target might be hard to explain. It would pose challenges for the

Fed’s communications strategy. 4. Even after 2012, there were questions about the importance that Fed officials attached to these numerical commitments. The 2 percent inflation target was repeatedly undershot. Chairman Bernanke’s warning in June 2013 that the central bank might soon start “tapering” its security purchases caused mortgage rates to shoot up and raised doubts about whether the central bank was committed to maintaining its current policies of ease until the economy had strengthened significantly. 5. As reported in the New York Times (July 29, 2010). Bullard (2010) describes his views of the danger of deflation. 6. This evaluation of the Fed, clearly, is very different from that of contemporary observers impressed by the rhetoric of officials that they were prepared to do whatever was needed to avoid deflation and initiate a robust recovery (see, e.g.,

Wessel 2009 and Irwin 2013). Economists like Krippner (2012) have used the term “structure” of interest rates to estimate how expansionary policy was in this period. Although the Fed was incapable of pushing short-term rates below zero, its asset purchases could affect mediumand long-term rates, notably through expectations channels. Krippner relates the term “structure” to other observable economic variables and concludes that the “shadow” Fed funds rate, adjusted for asset purchases, was on the order of −1 percent in early 2009, when a simple Taylor Rule that relates the Fed funds target to the output gap and the rate of inflation suggests it should have been much lower. Using different methods, Wu and Xia (2013) find the same thing.

More distance—and more systematic economic analysis—thus suggests that

Fed policy was far from being as expansionary as was called for under the circumstances. 7. Mantega had already raised the currency-war flag a week earlier in a speech to an audience of Brazilian industrial leaders and was quick to repeat the phrase subsequently. 8. See Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2010). 9. The yield on ten-year agency debt fell by 156 basis points and that on agency mortgage-backed securities by 113 basis points, according to their estimates.

Time series analysis using monthly data spanning the period January 1985 to June 2008, just prior to the financial crisis, confirms their results, although it yields slightly smaller effects, as does a time series study by Canlin and

Wei (2012). 10. See Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011). 11. At the same time, QE1 and QE2 were complicated policies, so considering just the minutes or hours around the announcement may not be enough time for investors to evaluate them and for the full effects to materialize. 12. The Fed did not purchase corporate bonds directly under the program, but these are relatively close substitutes for mortgage-backed securities. 13. See Yellen (2011).

Chapter 22 1. The story of the auto bailout would take us far afield; telling it here would be a bit like telling the story of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The rationale for the bailout was that, in the distressed financial conditions of 2008–09, Chrysler and

General Motors would have been unable to obtain the working capital needed to keep operating. This would have led to their liquidation, causing unnecessary disruption and costing jobs where they might have been saved. That the companies quickly reemerged from bankruptcy reorganization (Chrysler as a subsidiary of FIAT) and returned to profitability supports the rationale. The government lost some $10 billion on the $80 billion bailout loan because its shares in GM, when sold, did not cover its costs. Those losses might have been avoided had the companies been put through bankruptcy earlier (there was a lengthy delay as the companies were caught in the policy vacuum between the

Bush and Obama administrations, much as the banks had been caught in the vacuum between the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations). Losses might also have been minimized had the loan to GM been smaller, forcing the company to negotiate a deeper restructuring of its liabilities. See Rattner (2010). 2. See Chapter 16. 3. Including, it should be noted, mortgages on second homes. Prior to 1979, when the new US bankruptcy code went into effect, a number of states had permitted judges to restructure mortgages on principal residences, and in some cases judges could still restructure second mortgages on such homes. 4. Kaiser (2013), pp. 109–10. 5. See, for example, Kuttner (2013), p. 224. 6. Principal reduction was permitted under HAMP, though it was not required, and fewer than 5 percent of mortgage modifications involved reductions of principal. DeMarco, in his capacity as acting director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, opposed it, as noted above. Thus, many homeowners whose interest payments were reduced still had an incentive to walk away, creating a likelihood of default on the new loans and eventual foreclosure. 7. Recall how the proponents of Glass-Steagall could push through the measure in part because the big banks realized that their securities market franchises had already been destroyed and could not be rebuilt. 8. In Kaufman (2013). 9. This included so-called common equity tier 1 capital in the amount of 4.5 percent and a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5 percent. 10. Section 165 of Dodd-Frank required the regulators to impose more stringent capital standards on systemically important financial firms, while the Basel

Committee on Banking Supervision developed a framework for calibrating capital surcharges for systemically significant banks. 11. Strictly speaking, the tenth member was not a regulator but an independent member with insurance expertise, insurance regulation having traditionally been left to the states (with now-well-known negative consequences). 12. Subsequently, in September 2013, it so designated a third institution, Prudential

Financial. But even then it failed to specify what additional capital requirements would be applied to these systemically important institutions. 13. The new entity was to require each agency to submit its methodology for review, and it would deregister any agency whose methods were judged inadequate, although the office did little in the short run to prove its mettle. 14. In addition, it required smaller banks to report the results of their own company-run stress tests. 15. This in turn caused a number of large hedge funds to pay off their outside investors and turn themselves into “home offices,” where they would be free of registration requirements. 16. A bill to cap the nondeposit liabilities of individual banks at 2 percent of US

GDP was introduced in the Senate by Ted Kaufman, mentioned above, who happily had no plans to run for election in 2010. The bill was voted down by a nearly two-to-one margin. Kaiser (2013, p. 304) concludes that “like the

House, the Senate preferred to try to improve the status quo, not toss it out.”

The UK, after its experience with several large bank failures and taking the advice of the expert commission chaired by Sir John Vickers, went the other way, advancing legislation to ring-fence the investment bank operations of its financial institutions, essentially breaking them up into retail and investment banks. 17. Kaiser (2013), pp. 238–39. 18. Geithner (2014), p. 421, not an entirely disinterested party, describes how

Brown insisted on the 3 percent exemption to protect Fidelity and State

Street Corp., two prominent financial institutions from his home state, from the effects of the Volcker Rule. Brown received campaign contributions from MassMutual, State Street, and other financial-services companies in the period when the 3 percent exemption from the proprietary trading ban was being discussed, as detailed by Slack (2010). The revelation played no small role in his subsequent defeat at the hands of Warren in the 2012 general election. 19. US Senate (2013), p. 4.

Chapter 23 1. Sequestration started a few months later, in April 2013. 2. This is based on extrapolating the 1934–1937 trend. Recall that unemployment fell by an average of 2½ percentage points a year over this period. It then rose by roughly 5 percentage points between 1937 and 1938. 3. This point, with the particulars that follow, has been made by Reinhart and

Rogoff (2009b) and more fully in Reinhart and Rogoff (2014). 4. The passage is from FDR’s campaign address, Pittsburgh, October 1, 1936, available at http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=15149. 5. These are emphasized by Thorndike (2008). 6. The details are in Chapter 18. 7. These estimates are by the leading scholar of top incomes, the economist

Emmanuel Saez (2013). 8. See Alter (2013), p. 160 and passim. 9. There was also the question of whether a legislative commitment to cut future deficits would be credible, since it could be reversed by a future Congress, in which case it would have even less impact on interest rates. 10. See Sinai, Orszag, and Rubin (2004). 11. Scheiber (2011), p. 150; Romer (2009b). 12. See below, Chapter 24. 13. This position is argued most powerfully by Alter (2013); see his p. 166 and passim. 14. Earlier, in negotiations headed by Vice President Biden, House Republicans pushed for $1.7 trillion in cuts. The administration’s counter then became the basis for its final concession and for the agreement. 15. This assessment came in the Fund’s 2013 Article IV review of the United States, released at midyear (IMF 2013a). In an analysis published two months earlier, the Congressional Budget Office put the impact in the middle of this range, estimating that fiscal contraction would chop off perhaps 1½ percentage points of US growth in 2013 (CBO 2013). 16. The issue was featured in a box entitled “Economic Effects of Federal Fiscal

Policy,” starting on page 10 of the report (Federal Reserve Board 2013). 17. The actual tapering began later, in December 2013. 18. See Bernanke (2013). 19. The first quotation is from Lacker (2013), the second from Robb (2013).

Chapter 24 1. See Chapter 11. If they were not announced publicly for a few additional weeks, they were already known to the regulators or should have been. 2. The quotes are from the introductory statement by Trichet following the ECB board meeting on December 1, 2005 (ECB 2005). 3. The Match interview is available on the ECB’s website: http://www.ecb.​europa. eu/press/key/date/2005/html/sp051215.en.html. 4. And it indicated it would do so at fixed rates. This was the policy of “fixed rate tenders with full allotment.” 5. A classic study of the question is Friedman and Schwartz (1982); the subsequent literature is enormous. 6. Remarks quoted in Brown (2010), p. 121. 7. The broke-the-fall comment is from then–World Bank President Robert Zoellick, but it is cited approvingly in Brown (2010), where the “one-trillion-dollar plan” is the title of c­ hapter 4. 8. See Bradford and Linn (2010). 9. Figures here are from van Riet (2010). His table 4, p. 25, lists fiscal stimulus packages for individual Eurozone countries and also breaks out other components of the fiscal stance (such as revenue shortfalls and the built-in momentum of public expenditure). 10. Goldstein and Woglom (1992) had optimistically advanced this argument, showing how US state and municipal governments with relatively heavy debts were charged higher interest rates when attempting to borrow. In the event, their optimism was disappointed. 11. “Could a country that is a member of the euro zone default? Investors have generally thought not. . . . It is hard to imagine the leading lights of the European

Union or the Frankfurt-based European Central Bank would allow a member to undermine the bloc. But a downgrade of Greece’s credit rating has set alarm bells ringing in global markets.” New York Times (December 9, 2009, p. B2).

The fact that Dubai Ports World had just announced in November it was facing difficulties that would likely require it to restructure its debts did not help. 12. New York Times (December 12, 2009, p. A4). 13. The quotation is from an interview broadcast on the website of the Christian

Democratic Union Party, as reported at http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/​financialcrisis/9408349/Angela-Merkel-unsure-European-project-will-work.​html. 14. Thomsen’s previous experience was with programs in Serbia and Romania. He had also been involved in negotiating the Fund’s program with Iceland. All this reassured the IMF hierarchy more than it did Athens. 15. Quoted in Thomas and Castle (2011). 16. Commerzbank had acquired Dresdner Bank, combining the country’s secondand third-largest banks, just days before the failure of Lehman Brothers, in a transaction that could not have been timed worse. Investing in high-yielding Greek debt then became an attractive way for management to dig itself out of the resulting financial hole—until, that is, the market in Greek bonds went south. 17. This according to estimates by the Bank for International Settlements. The holdings of French banks were not far behind. 18. The reference is to Provopoulos (2012). 19. European Commission (2010), p. 29. 20. The review in question dated from mid-2009. Later it was claimed that IMF staff already recognized Greece was insolvent but watered down the language in response to objections from the Greek authorities. See again Thomas and

Castle (2011). This conclusion is hard to reconcile, however, with staff’s rosy growth forecasts. 21. Specifically, “large loans” means loans in excess of six times the recipient country’s quota subscription to the institution. The Greek loan far exceeded this limit. IMF staff voiced sufficient reservations about the sustainability of Greece’s debt that the IMF amended its “exceptional access policy,” for loans greater than six times quota, to include cases where there was “a high risk of international spillover effects,” thus enabling the Fund’s executive board to go ahead. 22. This according to Olli Rehn, EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, quoted in Taylor (2013). 23. Quoted in Erlanger and Saltmarsh (2010). 24. IMF (2013b), p. 28. EU officials involved in the decision, from Rehn to Trichet, disputed the implication that it was mainly opposition from the Europeans, as opposed to the Fund, that ruled out restructuring. Suffice it to say there was plenty of blame to go around.

Chapter 25 1. The backlash was especially strong in Germany. The irony here is that it was

German—along with French—officials’ reluctance to contemplate a restructuring, given the weakness of their banks, that led to the original approach that left the creditors whole. Hence the Deauville declaration anticipated that restructuring would now be mandatory but only starting in 2013. It was a classic instance of Augustinian reasoning: “Save me Oh Lord, just not yet.”

It was also not a distinction that the markets were capable of drawing. 2. An example is his 2012 Financial Times article “Europe Must Stay the Austerity

Course” (Rehn 2012). 3. This is the estimate of the combined effects of expenditure cuts and tax increases, in conjunction with a fiscal multiplier as high as 1.7 (Blanchard and

Leigh 2013, op. cit.). 4. European Commission (2013), p. 9. 5. More precisely, existing home prices quadrupled, while new home prices tripled, suggesting that those newly built homes on the outskirts of existing cities and in the countryside were imperfect substitutes for the existing housing stock. 6. Between 2000 and 2007, real GDP had grown at an average annual rate of 5.7 percent. There may have been a tendency for the figures to overstate the reality insofar as multinational firms preferred to book their profits in Ireland to take advantage of the country’s corporate-profit-friendly tax regime. But the growth of Gross National Product, which strips out these international transfers, ran at an impressive annual average of 5.0 percent over the period. 7. IMF (2006), p. 5. Stress tests by the Central Bank of Ireland, conducted in 2007, similarly concluded that even with a sharp decline in house prices and a sharp rise in unemployment, capital would remain adequate at every bank. 8. Donovan and Murphy (2013), p. 70. 9. This according to the Commission of Investigation into the Banking Sector in

Ireland (2011), p. 22. Also called the Nyberg Committee, it reported that the top twenty customers, virtually all property developers, accounted for as much as 50 percent of the bank’s Irish loan book. 10. This again is according to the Nyberg Committee, op. cit. (2011), p. 32. 11. Lyons and Carey (2011), p. 25. 12. Ibid., p. 98. 13. Donovan and Murphy (2013), p. 187. Quinn’s loans were formally called in 2011, leading to a series of court cases and a stay for the defendant in Mountjoy Prison. 14. As Donovan and Murphy note (ibid.), there are no official written records of the critical meeting, forcing investigators to reply on the recollections and oral testimony of participants. There was then pressure in November from the ECB, which controlled provision of liquidity to the Irish banking system, for further extension of the guarantee (although the letter in question from the ECB to the Irish finance minister has not been released). In mid-2013, the Irish Parliament moved to open an investigation into the decision, in the course of which the process leading to the disastrous decision will presumably come to light. 15. To be precise, 31.2 percent. The deficit was 11 percent of GDP net of bank recapitalization costs. 16. The recession started already in 2008, according to the standard business cycle chronology. Discretionary fiscal tightening over 2008–2010 was a cumulative €14.6 billion, or 9.3 percent of 2010 GDP. The four-year plan for 2011–2014 announced in November 2010 and subsequently agreed with the Troika (see below) then involved a further €15 billion of discretionary fiscal tightening. 17. That the amount of the Troika loan closely matched the ultimate cost to the government of the bank bailout was not a coincidence. There was also a €17.5 billion contribution from Ireland itself (from the Treasury and National Pension Reserve). 18. Not so the IMF, which by custom gets paid back first and in full. Thus,

Noonan’s proposal was reported to have garnered the support of the Fund. 19. Eventually haircuts would be administered to some holders of junior bank bonds, so-called subordinated debt. Some of these were substantial. But the holders of senior unsecured bonds—unlike the Irish taxpayer—escaped. 20. To be fair, the paragraph in question continued: “We recognise that the risks in the short term are tilted to the downside, and, in particular, the headwinds from fiscal consolidation on domestic demand could be larger than anticipated.

Over the longer haul also, continued private and public sector balance sheet adjustments, coupled with a weak banking sector, could delay the recovery.” See

European Commission (2009), para. 3. 21. The net immigration number was lower, but this does not change the point that this was a costly form of adjustment. 22. This as of the end of 2008. 23. An analysis emphasizing these factors is Antras, Segura-Caytuela, and

Rodriguez-Rodriguez (2010). 24. The first €4.3 billion was initially provided as a loan, converted into equity when it became apparent that there was no way the bank could pay it back.

Eventually Bankia announced that its losses for the 2012 financial year exceeded €21 billion. Its chairman, Rodrigo Rato, IMF managing director prior to Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was among those investigated in connection with charges that the bank had falsified accounts and manipulated share prices. 25. See Oliver Wyman Group (2012), p. 58 et seq. 26. Mario Draghi’s pronouncement, less than two months prior to the consultants’ report, that the ECB would “do whatever it takes” to hold the euro together, by implicitly promising more support to the market in Spanish government bonds, worked in the same direction. See Chapter 26.

Chapter 26 1. Prices more than doubled between 2000 and 2007, which tells the tale. 2. This according to figures released by the country’s Office of National Statistics in March 2014. 3. See Office for Budget Responsibility (2013), p. 55. 4. The recommendation came in the Fund’s Article IV report on the British economy (IMF 2012). Data above on the extent of fiscal consolidation in the UK are similarly from this source. 5. Laeven and Valencia (2012) put the total cost at 8.8 percent of GDP, 7.8 percent after recovery of income through, inter alia, asset sales by the government.

There was still the possibility of further losses arising from contingent liabilities (such as asset purchases) as well as future recoveries, although these were unlikely to change the picture. 6. Cited in Winch (1969), p. 118. 7. In his Mais Lecture, delivered on the eve of the election, Osborne pointed to the Reinhart and Rogoff (2009b) argument that debt begins to exercise “a large negative impact on long term growth” when it exceeds 90 percent of GDP (Osborne 2010). 8. As a result of these and related measures, public sector net investment was cut sharply under the coalition’s budgets, from 3½ percent of GDP in the last year of the Labour government to 2½ percent in 2010–11, 1¾ percent in 2011–12, and barely 1½ percent in 2012–13. And this in a period of unprecedentedly low interest rates, when the government could have been borrowing to invest in the future. 9. Warner (2013), at http://blogs.telegraph.​co.uk/finance/jeremywarner/100025496/​ oh-god-i-cannot-take-any-more-of-the-austerity-debate/. 10. The criminal case later collapsed and the charges were dropped. A civil suit and countersuit then followed, leading to a financial settlement in late 2012 (terms of which were confidential). 11. Quoted in Sirletti (2011). 12. The institute used a very generous interest rate of 9 percent to discount future interest and principal payments, which implied a 21 percent net present value loss for investors. A more reasonable interest rate of, say, 5 percent, like that used by the IMF in its debt sustainability calculations, painted a very different picture. For details see Zettelmeyer, Trebesch, and Gulati (2013). 13. Restructuring required a quorum of votes representing 50 percent of the face value of outstanding bonds, with bondholders representing two-thirds of the face value of the outstanding privately held debt taking part in the vote.

Importantly, these requirements applied across all bonds, not individual bond by individual bond. 14. See, for example, the bank’s annual report for 2010 (European Central Bank 2011, pp. 20, 92). The central bank also kept interest rates on hold for the entire year. 15. Eventually, in 2013, the ECB released details on what it had purchased under the SMP. The main beneficiary was Italy, whose bonds accounted for almost half the total purchased, followed by Spain and then Greece. 16. For example, it would lengthen the term of lending under the program and supply LTROs with full allotment, meaning it would provide the banks with as much liquidity against collateral as they might require. The problem, of course, was that the banks were not inclined to demand much liquidity from the ECB because they were not much inclined to lend it to the private sector. 17. As, for example, in March 2011, just before the ECB raised interest rates. 18. The ECB then cut interest rates by 50 basis points at the end of 2011, but the damage was done. 19. Thus, on July 24 Patrick Doering, secretary general of the Free Democratic

Party, part of Chancellor Merkel’s governing coalition, unhelpfully suggested that “it could help to create confidence in markets if Greece were no longer part of the Eurozone”; Deutsche Börse Group (2012). 20. As widely reported, in inter alia Daily Telegraph (June 26, 2012), http://​www. telegraph.co.uk/finance/financialcrisis/9428894/Debt-crisis-Ma​rio-Draghi pledges-to-do-whatever-it-takes-to-save-euro.html. 21. For the time being, the ECB didn’t actually have to do anything. OMT was not activated in the second half of 2012 or in 2013; the promise alone was enough.

One is reminded of how simply granting new powers to the Federal Reserve to discount notes, drafts, bills, and acceptances was enough to reassure holders of bank deposits in the 1933 crisis (see Chapter 15). 22. In February 2014 the Constitutional Court issued a somewhat ambiguous ruling questioning certain aspects of OMT, referring the case to the

European Court of Justice, and retaining the right to rule further on the constitutionality of the ECB’s measures. This did nothing to clear up the confusion. 23. There was also a “two-pack” of further regulations aimed at strengthening the monitoring of the draft budgetary plans of euro-area members and adoption of a “European Semester” to harmonize the timing of budgetary decision making across member states. 24. The limit on the structural deficit was a more generous 1 percent of GDP for countries with debt ratios of less than 60 percent. 25. This had permitted Germany and France to avoid their application when violating the monetary union’s budgetary guidelines in 2003–04, an event that did not exactly enhance the credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact going forward. 26. Under that agreement, a €55 billion fund was to be built up through levies on the banks between 2016 and 2026. In the meantime, resolution costs would be borne by levies on the banks themselves, national governments’ resources, and

ESM loans to those governments, in that order. This arrangement threatened to transfer the difficulties of one bank first to other banks and then to the sovereign. Moreover, the resolution fund would not possess a credit line equivalent to that extended to the FDIC by the US government, raising further questions about the adequacy of its resources. Overall, this was rather less than the necessary banking union, reflecting political realities, and German reservations in particular. 27. This compares the S&P 90 starting in 1929 and the S&P 500 starting in 2007. Similarly, by August 2013 the S&P 500 was again above its 2007 peak, whereas it took the S&P 90 almost three full decades to match the 1929 peak.

World equity market indices, compared by Eichengreen and O’Rourke (2010), show the same thing. By early 2010, they had recovered to within 25 percent of April 2008 (Bear Stearns) levels; after 1929, in contrast, they continued to trend downward, hitting a trough in July 1932 at barely 33 percent of June 1929 levels. Conclusion 1. The references are of course to Friedman and Schwartz (1963), Keynes (1936), and Polanyi (1944). 2. The most influential statement of this alternative was probably Nurkse (1944), cited in Chapter 17 above. 3. To be sure, six full years after the crisis there was Thomas Piketty (2014). But

Piketty dismissed the impact of the crisis on inequality as a blip. He devoted just one page (p. 297) to hypothesizing that inequality causing lowerand middle-class incomes in the United States to stagnate encouraged households to take on additional debt in order to support the continued growth of their living standards—debt that heightened the fragility of the financial system. A systematic analysis of the connections between inequality and the crisis remains to be written. R EFER ENCES Accominotti, Olivier.
