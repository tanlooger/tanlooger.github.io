title: Chapter 1 New Age Economics

At five foot four and with a round face, Charles Ponzi hardly cut an imposing figure. Having arrived in the United States at the age of twenty-one from Parma, Italy, he did not speak English with the authority of a patrician American financier. But if small in stature, Ponzi would loom large in the literature on financial crises. In time, “Ponzi scheme” would become an indelible part of the lexicon of financial instability, surpassing even the likes of “Greenspan put” and “Lehman Brothers moment.”

Ponzi made his name, as it were, with a scheme to arbitrage the market in international postal reply coupons. These instruments were introduced in 1906 by agreement at the Universal Postal Union Congress, held, auspiciously, in Italy. They were intended as a vehicle for sending funds abroad, enabling the recipient to buy stamps and post a reply.

The 1906 congress was convened in the gold standard era, when exchange rates were locked. Delegates thus had no way of anticipating the complications that suspension of the gold standard could create for their agreement. But with the outbreak of the World War, governments embargoed gold exports. Buying gold where it was cheap and selling it where it was dear had been the mechanism through which exchange rates were held stable. With the embargoes, which effectively suspended gold market transactions, currencies began fluctuating against one another.

Among the unanticipated consequences were those for the postal coupon agreement. The United States was the only belligerent whose currency maintained its value against gold during and after the war. European currencies depreciated against the dollar as governments printed money to finance military outlays, a trend only partially reversed with the armistice. As a result, 分页。。。postal reply coupons purchased abroad using European currencies could buy more than their cost in stamps in the United States. In 1919, sensing an opportunity, Ponzi borrowed money from business associates, which he sent to Italian contacts with instructions to purchase postal reply coupons and forward them to him in Boston.

Why Ponzi was uniquely able to detect this opportunity is, to put it mildly, unclear. Not surprisingly, the appearance of substantial profits was an illusion. Ponzi’s contacts could assemble only a limited number of coupons, and even then, completing the transaction took time, during which funds devoted to the project were tied up.

And time was not something Ponzi possessed in abundance, since he had promised to double his investors’ money in ninety days. To pay those dividends, he was forced to employ the capital obtained from new subscriptions, leaving no funds for the postal coupon arbitrage motivating the scheme. This in turn made it essential to attract additional investors, which Ponzi did by incorporating as the impressive-sounding Securities Exchange Company and hiring a phalanx of salesmen. The scheme collapsed in August 1920 with publication of a Boston Post exposé penned by William McMasters—a journalist Ponzi had hired to generate publicity for his operation.1

That Ponzi’s promise to double his investors’ money in ninety days had not raised red flags says something about the readiness of investors to suspend disbelief in the intoxicating financial atmosphere of the 1920s. One can’t help but think of the inability of investors in the equally heady 2000s to see through the ability of Bernie Madoff to generate supernormal profits with barely a fluctuation year after year after year.

Indicted for mail fraud, Ponzi pled guilty and was sentenced to three and a half years in federal prison. The investing public of New England, however, was not so easily assuaged. While still in prison, Ponzi was indicted by the State of Massachusetts on twenty-two charges of larceny. The now impecunious defendant served as his own attorney, more than capably at first. But as one trial followed another, he grew fatigued. Where the first jury acquitted, the second deadlocked, and the third found the defendant guilty. Freed on bail, Ponzi fled to the remote backwaters of Florida, where he began doing business under an assumed name.

In 1925, doing business in Florida meant transacting in real estate. Ponzi transformed himself into the promoter of a subdivision near Jacksonville. “Near” in this case meant sixty-five miles west of the city, where Ponzi set about developing (if one is permitted elastic use of the word) an expanse of scrubland covered with palmetto, weeds, and the occasional oak. Subdividing meant driving stakes into the ground to help owners identify their homestead. Once lots were staked, at an ambitious twenty-three per acre, they were offered at $10 apiece.

The capital needed to purchase, survey, and subdivide the land was provided by investors in Ponzi’s Charpon (Charles Ponzi) Land Corporation. Subscribers were promised $30 for each $10 investment in sixty days, an even more impressive return than in the earlier postal coupon operation. This of course was nothing but another pyramid scheme in which early investors were paid with cash obtained from the proceeds of selling shares to new investors. It didn’t take long for the fraud to be detected or for the perpetrator’s identity to be revealed. Ponzi was indicted for violating Florida statutes regarding trusts, tried, and again found guilty by a jury of his peers.2 That Ponzi, on reaching Florida, found a home in the real estate business was no coincidence, Florida being in the midst of a property boom the likes of which the United States had never seen.

The country had experienced real estate booms and busts before, but these had centered on farmland. This was its first urban, or more precisely suburban, real estate boom, driven by the automobile. As more Americans acquired cheap and reliable cars, epitomized by Henry Ford’s Model T, suburban living became possible. And as Florida grew accessible to motorized visitors, its temperate climate and cheap land proved a powerful lure. The influx of Northerners who arrived in the winter of 1920–21 were known as “Tin Can Tourists” for their less-than-elegant mode of transport, which sometimes also served as a temporary abode.3

Real estate promoters, not a few of whom were also automobile enthusiasts, were quick to recognize the connection. Carl Fisher, who with his brothers founded the Prest-O-Lite Corporation and then Fisher Body to provide acetylene headlamps and bodies to the fledgling motor-vehicle industry, was a case in point. Fisher first encountered the peninsula that came to be known as Miami Beach in 1910 on a honeymoon yacht trip with his fifteen-year-old bride. In the final stages of negotiating the sale of Prest-O-Lite to Union Carbide, he was in a position to buy an elegant vacation and retirement home across the peninsula on Biscayne Bay.

But retirement bored Fisher, who was still only in his thirties. By 1913 he was in the real estate business; by 1915 he was the region’s leading property developer. And if there was not enough property to develop, Fisher created more. He moved dredging equipment into Biscayne Bay, pumping up sand to elongate the beach. Will Rogers, as usual, put it best: “Carl discovered that sand could hold up a Real Estate sign, and that was all he wanted it for. Carl rowed the customers out in the ocean and let them pick out some nice smooth water where they would like to build, and then he would replace the water with an island, and you would be a little Robinson Crusoe of your own.”4

To strengthen the connections between the automobile and Florida real estate, Fisher promoted construction of the Dixie Highway, linking the state with the Upper Midwest. He founded the Dixie Highway Association. He seeded newspapers with articles celebrating the project. He subdued conflicts between rival cities seeking to sit astride the route by laying out both eastern and western branches. No sacrifice was too great in order to deliver the desired flow of traffic.

To be sure, other factors also nourished the Florida property boom, including the strong recovery of the American economy from the postwar recession and expectations that there would now be a permanent acceleration of growth. The 1920s saw a revolution in factory design, as production was reorganized to capitalize on electric power. Factories had traditionally used steam power distributed through a network of overhead drive shafts and brackets. Electrification permitted removal of this steam-related apparatus, making it possible to install overhead cranes to move subassemblies. Electricity also allowed workers to use portable power tools and move freely along the line. This increased their productivity relative to their predecessors, who were figuratively bolted to the shop floor, much like the steam-powered machinery with which they worked. In this way electrification allowed employers to adopt scientific management practices designed to optimize the efficiency of labor input, notably through the time and motion studies of the management consultant Frederick Winslow Taylor.

The full potential of the assembly line, symbolized by Henry Ford’s massive River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, whose construction began in 1917, could now be realized. This in turn held out the promise of productivity gains at a rate never experienced previously. The fact that real GDP rose by nearly 5 percent per annum between 1922 and 1929, faster than anything the United States had experienced over a comparable period, seemingly confirmed this optimistic view.

Faster productivity growth would mean not just higher incomes but also higher prices for financial assets, or so investors were led to believe. What was true of real estate, in other words, was true also of other investments. The leading corporations added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the 1920s, the likes of American Telephone and Telegraph, Western Union, International Harvester, and Allied Chemical, were exemplars of this technological revolution. There is an obvious parallel with the run-up to the 2008–09 crisis, when it was argued that productivity growth would accelerate as firms learned to commercialize new information technologies. The transformative general-purpose technology in the 1920s may have been electricity rather than the computer, but the impact on investor psychology was the same. Monetary policy then poured fuel on the fire. Creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 encouraged the belief that the business cycle instability that traditionally plagued the country had been tamed. The Fed was charged with preventing the swings in interest rates that had perturbed financial markets and economic activity in earlier years (with providing an “elastic currency,” in the words of the Federal Reserve Act). Insofar as it was likely to succeed, investment would be safer, encouraging the plungers. The 1920s were known as the “New Era,” capturing the idea that the country had entered a new age not only of faster productivity growth but also of greater economic and financial stability. Shades of the “Great Moderation,” the supposed diminution of the business cycle in the lead-up to the 2008–09 crisis.

Although the Fed was quick to make use of its new policy instruments, it did not deploy them in the anticipated way. The expectation of the founders was that the new central bank would adjust credit conditions to the needs of domestic business. Somewhat unexpectedly, now instead it adjusted them with foreign circumstances in mind. In mid-1924, the Federal Reserve banks cut the interest rates they charged when advancing credit to commercial banks (their “discount rates”) from 4.5 to 3 percent, with an eye toward helping Great Britain back onto the gold standard.5 (The main way central banks injected credit into the economy in this era was by discounting promissory notes held by banks and firms—that is to say, by purchasing them at a discount relative to their face value in return for cash. Hence the term “discount rate.”) Britain had experienced more inflation than the United States during the World War, damaging its competitiveness. It consequently lacked the capacity to peg the sterling price of gold or to restore the traditional exchange rate between sterling and the dollar once wartime controls were lifted. The UK therefore abandoned convertibility in March 1919, allowing the sterling-dollar exchange rate to fluctuate and, not incidentally, suggesting opportunities to the likes of Ponzi.

Very Serious People in Britain and America saw reconstruction of the prewar gold standard as a priority. Prominent among them was Benjamin Strong, the influential governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Strong was firmly of the view that exchange rate instability and the uncertainty to which it gave rise had a withering effect on trade.6 And the state of trade, foreign as well as domestic, mattered importantly for an America that had assumed Britain’s mantle as the world’s leading exporter. “Well-balanced prosperity” required absorption by foreign markets of America’s “surplus production,” in the words of the annual report of the Federal Reserve Board for 1925, a document significantly shaped by Strong.7 And augmenting that absorption capacity depended in turn on the financial normalization that only the gold standard could provide. In his capacity as secretary, vice president, and then president of Bankers Trust Company and confidant of John Pierpont Morgan, whose firm, J. P. Morgan & Co., possessed its own sister organization in London, Strong appreciated the importance of these international connections. As founding governor of a public agency that saw its mandate as transforming New York into a leading international financial center, he regarded reestablishment of a stable international monetary system as central to that goal.

Under the prewar gold standard, the pound sterling was the sun around which other currencies orbited. Much of the world’s trade was financed and settled in sterling, and London was the leading international financial center. Even though the war years and 1920s saw a considerable expansion of international financial business in New York and hence the dollar’s acquisition of an international role, Britain’s resumption of gold convertibility—permitting sterling to once again be converted into gold at a fixed domestic-currency price—was still seen as a precondition for resumption by other countries. Hence the exchange rate at which sterling was stabilized would in turn determine the rate, in both senses of the word, at which other countries restored gold convertibility.

Britain thus came under pressure from US officials to take this momentous step. Strong, in particular, emphasized the importance of Britain restoring not just gold convertibility but also the prewar exchange rate of $4.86 to the pound. The prewar exchange rate was important for sterling’s prestige and, Strong believed, the Bank of England’s credibility. The adverse consequences for the international system of failing to restore it, he warned, were “too serious really to contemplate.”8

Montagu Norman, governor of the Bank of England since 1920, shared his American friend’s perspective. In letters to Strong, he emphasized the desirability of returning to a gold standard of the pre–World War I variety. But unlike a modern central banker, Norman made little effort to explain his reasoning. His public utterances were famously inarticulate, something that lent an air of mystery, if not confusion, to his policy decisions. In The Shape of Things to Come, the futurist fantasy published in 1933 at the depths of the Depression, H. G. Wells found Norman an irresistible target. “Instead of the clear knowledge of economic pressures and movements that we have today,” wrote Wells, looking back from an imaginary future, “strange Mystery Men were dimly visible through a fog of battling evasions and misstatements, manipulating prices and exchanges. Prominent among these Mystery Men was a certain Mr. Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1935. He is among the least credible figures in all history, and a great incrustation of legends has accumulated about him. In truth the only mystery about him was that he was mysterious.”

Wells got many things right, including the importance that modern central bankers attach to transparency and communication.9 The one thing he got wrong was Norman’s retirement. In fact, the strange Mystery Man did not step down from the governorship of the Bank of England until 1944. Whether or not his incoherence was purposeful, Norman was the father of constructive ambiguity, the central banker’s art, perfected by Alan Greenspan, of leaving things hanging. But one issue about which he was unambiguous was the desirability of restoring gold convertibility at the prewar rate against the dollar. A precondition for achieving this was for the Bank of England to acquire adequate stocks of gold, or equally, assets convertible into gold. And if acquiring adequate stocks required the assistance of the Federal Reserve System, then this was something Strong was ready to provide.

Thus, the low-interest-rate policy advocated by Strong starting in 1924 was designed to help the Bank of England acquire the reserves needed to return to gold. Low interest rates in New York encouraged funds to flow toward London, where rates were higher. Much of this funding ended up in the big London banks. Some ended up in the bankers’ bank; in other words, it ended up in the coffers of the Bank of England.

And if market forces did not convey an adequate flow of gold toward London, they could always be supplemented. With this in mind, the New York Fed purchased US treasury bonds, pushing down yields and encouraging additional finance to flow across the Atlantic.10

But these financial operations, by themselves, might not be enough to put Britain firmly back on the gold standard. In addition there would have to be a rebalancing of competitive positions. Although British prices had risen more than US prices since the outbreak of the World War, there had been no corresponding rise in British labor productivity. Britain would lack export competitiveness if sterling was stabilized at its former level against the dollar. It would run a chronic trade deficit, and the gold the Bank of England had so laboriously acquired would just leak back out. Avoiding this outcome required reducing prices in the UK or raising them in the United States. Since before the war, British production costs had risen relative to those in the United States, Strong estimated, by 10 percent. Other observers reached similar conclusions. John Maynard Keynes, who had a reputation for expertise in such matters, put the differential at 9 percent.11 Strong’s hope was that keeping interest rates low would encourage spending, putting upward pressure on US prices and helping to correct the competitiveness gap.12 In the event, manipulating price levels turned out to be more difficult than anticipated. American prices rose between mid-1924 and mid-1925, but not by enough to erase the cost differential. When Britain returned to the gold standard in April 1925, the problem of inadequate competitiveness remained. Norman would battle it for the better part of six years. The effect of Strong’s low-interest-rate policy was therefore less to rebalance the world economy than to unbalance the economy of the United States. The effects manifested themselves in the housing bubble centered on Florida and, before long, Chicago, Detroit, and New York. Neither was the Wall Street boom that dominated the last part of the decade unrelated.

Strong was vehemently criticized by Adolph Miller for subordinating domestic financial-stability considerations to international objectives. A founding governor of the Federal Reserve System, Miller had graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1887 before going on to study in Cambridge, Paris, and Munich. He then taught at Cornell and Chicago (two universities that figure further in this story) before returning to Berkeley to establish the College of Commerce, and finally moving to Washington, D.C., to serve as assistant secretary of the interior, and then as a member of the Board of Governors upon being appointed by his fellow academician Woodrow Wilson in 1914.

Miller regaled in the didactic manner and ample vocabulary of the professor. As described by George Norris, governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, Miller was intoxicated by his verbal skills, which he displayed in all their glory in the meetings of the Federal Reserve Board and the Open Market Investment Committee.13 Miller used his verbal powers specifically to propound the “real bills doctrine,” which dictated that the central bank should provide just as much credit as was required for the legitimate needs of business and no more.14 That doctrine, developed in the early eighteenth century by, among others, the Scottish monetary theorist John Law, was intended as a guide to credit creation by the Bank of England, established in 1694. Not satisfied by his role in shaping the Bank of England, Law would go on to found a quasi-central bank for France, the Banque Générale, and play a role in the Mississippi Bubble and crash before retiring in disgrace, but no matter. His real bills doctrine informed the conduct of central bank policy for two centuries and more thereafter.

In particular, the doctrine informed the Federal Reserve Act of 1914, which spoke of the need for an “elastic currency,” a system in which supplies of currency and credit expanded and contracted to meet the legitimate needs of business. The failure of supplies of dollar currency and credit to respond in this way had led to sharp interest rate spikes and chronic financial instability throughout US history. This was the problem that creation of the Fed in 1914 was designed to correct.

As an adherent to the real bills doctrine, Miller was quick to conclude that directing Federal Reserve policy to the problems of the British economy, as Strong had done, rather than being guided by the legitimate needs of business was the height of irresponsibility. The professor was acerbic in his criticism of the governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. His unhappiness was deepened, no doubt, by the failure of other members of the Board of Governors and directors of the Reserve banks, typically men of affairs unversed in rigorous monetary analysis, to defer to academics like himself who had been properly schooled in theory and were therefore better qualified to advise on technical matters.

Miller’s voice was the loudest, but he was not alone. His criticisms were echoed by, among others, Charles Hamlin, the former assistant treasury secretary and unsuccessful candidate for governor of Massachusetts who now served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and by Herbert Hoover, Strong’s onetime ally, President Calvin Coolidge’s commerce secretary, and Miller’s Georgetown neighbor. Hoover, like Strong, was an internationalist by inclination, but even for him Strong’s 1924–25 initiative went too far. It paid too little attention to the domestic repercussions of the policy. Strong, Hoover concluded, had been seduced by his friend Norman; the head of the New York Fed was now a mere “mental annex to Europe.”15 Strong’s policy threatened to unleash inflation and fan financial excesses. If it was desirable to help Britain back onto the gold standard, then this should be done by other means, Hoover concluded, not by reducing US interest rates, something which could have undesirable side effects.

Miller and Hoover’s instinctual embrace of the real bills doctrine was a manifestation of the power of historical experience in shaping the outlook and actions of officials. Sharp spikes in interest rates resulting in widespread business distress, and in the worst case financial crisis, had been a feature of the US monetary and financial landscape since the country’s independence. Hence a doctrine that counseled tailoring supplies of money and credit to the legitimate needs of business, and looking to the level of interest rates to verify that those needs were being met, informed the outlook of many of the founding governors of the Federal Reserve System. Insofar as that doctrine warned against artificially reducing interest rates to help other countries, as Strong had done, following it more strictly would have prevented dangerous imbalances in US property and stock markets from building up. But that same doctrine would also suggest that there was no need for the Federal Reserve to act when interest rates fell from their high levels after 1929—lower interest rates indicating that US business had all the credit and the economy had all the monetary support they required.

The clear implication is that there is no single monetary doctrine for all seasons. This was a lesson Federal Reserve officials and the country would eventually learn at great expense. For the time being, the criticisms of these men had little effect. Strong was the dominant personality in the Federal Reserve System. With his background as J. P. Morgan’s right-hand man and his work on the front lines of the 1907 financial crisis, he spoke with authority on matters of financial policy, notwithstanding his lack of formal academic training. His was the voice of experience. If Strong attached more importance to events in London than Miami, then so be it.

And even though Fed policy contributed to the financial excesses of the period, it was not the only factor at work. In addition, there was the enabling role of a financial system that was only loosely regulated. There were governmental efforts to boost real estate and construction activity. There was the fact that housing starts had been depressed in the war years, making for pent-up demand now straining to be released.

Ambitious Florida promoters, liking nothing less than pent-up demand, did their best to liberate it. None was more ambitious than George Merrick, scion of a Congregationalist minister and grapefruit plantation owner. Merrick’s avocation was poetry. In 1920, celebrating his Florida environs, he published a volume of verse entitled Song of the Wind on a Southern Shore. There’s a Shore I know—that draws me And that warms me all the more!— Where the gumbo-limbo grows:— And the little lizards doze— Where the trade-wind blows Through the palm-tufted curvings Of the Biscayne shore16 Clearly Merrick’s principal talent lay in real estate development. Appointed Dade County commissioner in 1915, his main achievement was a network of roads connecting Miami with its future suburbs, and not least with his own planned community of Coral Gables, centered on what had been the family plantation. Pushing his poetic license to the hilt, Merrick pitched Coral Gables as a Spanish-style city where “your ‘Castles in Spain’ are made real.” The pit from which he mined the limestone and coral rock that was used to construct the homes was transformed into a Venetian lagoon complete with bridges, grottoes, and loggias. Merrick advertised in national magazines and out-ofstate newspapers, writing much of the copy himself. He lured clients to his still largely undeveloped suburb with free performances of Mabel Cody’s Flying Circus, a popular air show. Customers buying lots were rewarded with the opportunity of going aloft and seeing their property from the air.17 He opened opulent sales offices in New York and Chicago. Purchasing buses to transport potential buyers, he organized excursions from New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.

Not least, Merrick hired William Jennings Bryan, the former presidential candidate, secretary of state, and famed orator, to deliver the pitch. Bryan had moved to Florida to make life easier for his arthritic wife and immediately became Miami’s most famous resident. Having run for president in 1896 on a platform fighting for the small man and against the gold standard, Bryan was now paid by Merrick to stand on a platform of another kind, erected over the water, and speak not of the gold standard but of the Gold Coast. He was paid $100,000 for his year’s work, half in cash and half in land.

Coral Gables was successful from the start. More than five thousand customers attended the inaugural auction of home sites in 1921. After barely a year, Merrick was buying additional land in order to expand his vision and his development. Between November 1924 and March 1925, the height of the tourist season, Merrick recorded a remarkable $4 million a month in land sales.

State government officials responded enthusiastically to the boom. This was no surprise, since a substantial number of property developers, like Merrick, not to mention their bankers, graciously agreed to serve in public office. They used soaring real estate taxes to finance local road building and expand public services, creating the appearance of even greater prosperity. In 1923, with the boom in full swing, the Florida legislature placed on the ballot an amendment to the state constitution abolishing income and inheritance taxes with the goal of encouraging migration from the north.18 Grateful voters overwhelmingly approved the measure. They chose John Wellborn Martin, previously the mayor of Jacksonville, as governor at the conclusion of a campaign centering on his promise to complete an ambitious statewide road-building project. This was one of the things Ponzi was counting on, presumably, when marketing his fictitious development on the outer reaches of Martin’s hometown. Increasingly, the Florida real estate market displayed all the signs of an unsustainable boom in its late stages. Landowners hired binder boys to stand in the hot sun and entice prospective buyers. These young men in white suits, not a few of whom moonlighted as tennis and golf pros, encouraged potential purchasers to commit to a nonrefundable 10 percent down payment known as a binder.19 At the height of the boom, binder receipts circulated like currency, with hotels, nightclubs, and bordellos all accepting them in payment for services.

Binder boys received a fixed fee when the aspiring purchaser’s money arrived at the developer’s bank. Like mortgage brokers in the run-up to the 2006–07 real estate crash, they had little interest in whether a purchaser understood the contract to which he or she was committing or, for that matter, was capable of completing the transaction. The typical financial institution provided a mortgage loan only if the purchaser made a down payment of 50 percent.20 The 10 percent binder therefore implied a commitment to come up with another 40 percent, which for many aspiring property owners was easier said than done.

Coming up with more money would not be necessary, of course, if the binder, which represented first right of refusal on a desirable plot of land, was first sold off to another investor. The faster prices rose, the more prevalent this practice of flipping binders became. Successful binder boys graduated to real estate speculation, trading binders themselves. They put down 10 percent to purchase what was essentially an option on an undeveloped lot with the intention of immediately selling it at a higher price. In the summer of 1925, at the height of the boom, binders were bought and sold as often as eight times a day.21 Clearly, Floridians in the 1920s had nothing to learn from, and could have taught a few tricks to, property speculators in the run-up to the subprime crisis of 2007–08. This frenzied activity would not have been possible, of course, without the enabling role of the banks. “All the financial resources of existing banking and financial institutions were utilized to the full in financing this speculative movement,” as Herbert Simpson, a contemporary expert on the Florida housing boom, put it in an article tellingly entitled “Real Estate Speculation and the Depression,” published in the American Economic Review in 1933.22 Insurance companies bought what were considered the choicer mortgages; conservative banks loaned freely on real estate mortgages; and less conservative banks and financial houses loaned on almost everything. Real estate interests dominated the policies of many banks, and thousands of new banks were organized and chartered for the specific purpose of providing the credit facilities for proposed real estate promotions. The greater proportion were state banks and trust companies, many of them located in the outlying sections of the larger cities or in suburban regions not fully occupied by older and more established banking institutions. In the extent to which their deposits and resources were devoted to the exploitation of real estate promotions being carried on by controlling or associated interests, these banks commonly stopped short of nothing but the criminal law—and sometimes not short of that. Among the worst offenders were the building and loan associations, or B&Ls. In principle, these institutions, like mutual savings banks, were in the business of lending to their members.23 One can’t help but be reminded of the role in the 2008–09 crisis of Northern Rock, which similarly originated as a building society, the British equivalent of a B&L, though this is to get ahead of the story.

Building and loan associations were subject to a patchwork of variable and often lightly enforced state regulation.24 Lack of more stringent regulation reflected, in part, the belief that their funding was secure. Members held shares rather than deposits, which they were not able to liquidate at their pleasure. This freed B&Ls of the bank-run problem. Loans were collateralized, it was supposed, by rock-solid real estate. B&Ls used minimal leverage; they did not issue debt to supplement their shareholders’ equity. Unfortunately, these reassuring observations ignored the fact that those to whom they lent were themselves highly leveraged. They ignored the fact that not all real estate investments were rock-solid.25

The building and loan model had worked well in the nineteenth century. Now, however, it was enlisted by property developers to feed their ambitions and advance their narrow ends. B&Ls being easier to incorporate than depository institutions, real estate professionals established them for the purpose of financing residential development projects.26 A captive board of directors there might be, but it exercised little oversight. Out the window went the notion that B&Ls should extend mortgage credit only to reliable borrowers so as to return income to their members. B&Ls became leaders in extending low-down-payment loans. They issued second mortgages for 30 percent of a property’s value after the borrower secured a conventional first loan, typically for 50 percent, from a bank or insurance company, reducing the down payment to 20 percent.27 Another increasingly important source of finance for property development was securitization. Developers issued some $10 billion of real estate bonds in the course of the 1920s. A third were backed by residential mortgage interest payments, the remainder by future lease income from commercial real estate projects. Most of the latter were “single property bonds” issued to finance individual high-rise office buildings, apartments, and theaters, although there were also more complex instruments known as “guaranteed mortgage participation certificates”—what we would now call mortgage pass-through securities. Issued by title and mortgage guarantee companies and backed by commercial real estate projects, these more complex bonds were not easily traded. To entice investors to buy them, the issuer guaranteed the holder a rate of interest on the bond of 5 percent. This of course meant that the title or insurance company was on the hook if returns on the underlying investments fell short.28

In practice, insurance companies not only guaranteed the bonds but held them in their portfolios. Given the low interest rates on Treasury debt produced by Governor Strong’s internationally minded policies, real estate bonds were an attractive alternative. Between 1920 and 1930, the share of life insurance company assets backed by real estate and urban mortgages rose from 35 to 45 percent. The securities in question were also marketed to the public by the bond houses that originated and distributed them. Investors relied on the good name, such as it was, of the originator. There is little evidence that they discriminated among these bonds, demanding higher yields as a function of the riskiness of the mortgage pool.29 In this way large amounts of finance were channeled from individual investors into commercial and residential property development. In the event, the bonds in question, particularly those issued at the height of the boom, did not fare well in the 1930s.

This market in single-property bonds is a reminder that, along with the residential building boom in Florida, there was a commercial real estate boom centering on Chicago, New York, and Detroit.30 The 1920s were the decade of the skyscraper. More ground was broken for the construction of tall buildings than in any other decade of the twentieth century. The skyscraper boom reflected advances in construction, including more durable steel-frame structures, improved elevator motors, and application of Tayloresque time-and-motion methods to construction labor. But it also reflected a new financial model in which buildings were erected not simply as company headquarters but as financial investments, in the expectation that space could be leased to rent-paying tenants. New York City’s iconic Chrysler Building, for which ground was broken in 1928, served as the headquarters for the Chrysler Corporation but also had a variety of other tenants, from Pan American Airways to Adams Hats. The commercial real estate market peaked later than the residential real estate market. But it too was inflated beyond all reason. And it too caused major dislocations when it came crashing down. Still, nothing matched the extremes of the Florida property market. Miami saw the most frenzied speculation. The boom was more subdued in Orlando, and it did not reach Jacksonville until late, a fact that may have contributed to Ponzi’s downfall. The population of Dade County tripled between 1920 and 1925. The assessed value of property in Miami rose even faster, from $63 million in 1922 to $421 million in 1926. At this point, one in three residents of what was by now a city of eighty thousand was employed in property development in one way or another. At the height of the boom, “[r]‌ealtors passed slowly through large crowds along Flagler Street. . . barking out their offerings to the accompaniment of music from bands hired by the major developers. . . . At times the sidewalks. . . were impassable due to the great number of realtors transacting their business.”31 Agents buttonholed prospects at the railway terminal as they stepped off the train. Newspapers were weighed down by real estate advertisements. By late 1925, daily editions of the Miami Herald, which previously ran to no more than twenty pages, had ballooned to eighty-eight.

Labor grew scarce despite the influx of construction workers, many of whom were reduced to living in tents. George Merrick, displaying his gift for promotion, built an encampment of 375 tents on the outskirts of his development, which he dubbed the “Cool Canvas Cottages at Coral Gables.” The labor shortage was compounded by a building-material shortage aggravated by the decision of the Florida East Coast Railway to place a moratorium on shipments. Not only was the Miami rail yard jammed with twenty-two hundred freight cars, but the movement of freight was disrupted by the desperate efforts of the overtaxed railway to double-track its lines. With rail shipments at a standstill, steamships and sailboats were enlisted to move building material. Soon the Miami and Miami Beach docks were so jammed that unloading cargo became impossible. In September the steamship companies followed the railroad by embargoing shipments of furniture, construction machinery, and building materials.

All this was indicative of a bubble in its late stages. What caused it to burst is disputed, as is always the case with bubbles. A stock market correction was one possible trigger: the S&P Composite fell by 11 percent between February and May 1926. An unusually cold winter followed by a hot summer did not reassure homebuyers of Florida’s temperate climate. A tropical cyclone came ashore in December 1925, eroding the state’s pristine northeast beaches and dealing the market literally another blow. This was followed by a category 4 hurricane, described by the US Weather Bureau as “probably the most destructive hurricane ever to strike the United States,” that hit Miami on September 18, 1926. Three Miami Beach residents died in the flooding, a hundred more in Miami proper.32 The roof was torn off Carl Fisher’s vacation home. The Congregational Church in Coral Gables became a relief center—not exactly the purpose for which Merrick had intended it.

Meanwhile, concerns with what was happening in Florida did not stay in Florida. Twenty thousand residents of Savannah, Georgia, up and moved to the Sunshine State, lured by the attractions of the property boom, alarming the city fathers. Investors attracted to Florida real estate withdrew some $20 million from savings banks in Massachusetts. Bankers throughout the Northeast and Midwest grew anxious about the loss of deposits and earning assets.

Concerned as much with the loss of population and deposits as the welfare of residents, officials inveighed against these excesses. Ohio bankers placed newspaper ads warning against doing business with Florida real estate developers. State Commerce Director Cyrus Locher and the chief of the Securities Division, Norman Beck, selflessly traveled to Florida to investigate the market firsthand. In the interest of protecting the small investor, they recommended that companies selling securities backed by Florida real estate should not be permitted to do business in their state. The Ohio state legislature obediently passed a blue-sky law forbidding the practice.33 Anti-Florida propaganda included the assertion that good meat was unavailable in the state and dangerous reptiles were a threat in the major population centers.34 The Better Business Bureau, investigating practices in Florida, detected widespread fraud and moved to publish its findings. Ponzi’s arrest and prosecution were yet another unwelcome source of publicity.

As is typical of property markets, the volume of transactions fell first, followed after a time by prices. Local government revenues collapsed, and ambitious municipal development projects were abandoned. Bank clearings in Miami fell by two-thirds.35 One hundred fifty banks failed in Florida and neighboring Georgia, most of them members of the Manley-Anthony chain, so called because the banks in question were all owned or controlled by a pair of bankers, James R. Anthony and Wesley D. Manley, heavily implicated in property speculation, not least in the form of investments in Merrick’s Coral Gables development.36 Depositors suffered some $30 million in losses. Manley himself was arrested for engaging in fraudulent transactions to shelter his remaining assets from bankruptcy proceedings. In his defense, attorneys invoked an insanity plea. The financial repercussions did not extend beyond Florida and Georgia; still, the episode soured bankers and homebuyers on the residential real estate market. Residential housing starts nationally fell from 850,000 in 1926 to 810,000 in 1927, 750,000 in 1928, and 500,000 in 1929, despite the economy displaying no comparable weakness. With hindsight, some argued that the Federal Reserve should have done more to restrain the property boom. Doing so would have limited the excesses in the financial system and prevented disruptive bank failures in the South. It would have moderated an important source of downward pressure on economic activity that was starting to be felt at the worst possible time, toward the end of the 1920s.

But targeting a specific sector, housing, would have created many of the same dilemmas as targeting the sterling-dollar exchange rate. Fed officials would have been diverting their attention from their fundamental task of providing an elastic currency, with adverse consequences for economic stability. Using monetary policy to damp down financial imbalances might have ended up only bludgeoning the economy.

In a couple of years, with the boom on Wall Street, the same dilemma would reappear. The question then was whether the Fed should raise interest rates in response to the rise in the stock market, in order to prevent development of even more serious financial imbalances and risks. Alternatively, it could continue to direct monetary policy to the needs of the real economy and address financial imbalances through other means. It could rely on what today we would call “macroprudential policy,” and what contemporaries called “direct pressure,” that is, attempting to limit bank lending to financial markets directly.37

Ultimately, the Fed chose the first alternative, raising rates. The consequences would be far-reaching.
