It was not just the United States that experienced a housing boom at the turn of the century. Ireland and Spain took a backseat to no one when it came to housing market excesses. Residential real estate prices in the United States rose by 125 percent between 1997 and 2006, but this was child’s play compared to Spain, where they rose by 175 percent, and Ireland, where they increased by an extraordinary 260 percent.1 In the decade ending in 2005, 550,000 homes were built in Ireland, a country of just 4.5 million residents, permanently scarring the pastoral countryside so eloquently celebrated by William Butler Yeats.

If the consequences were the same, the causes differed. Neither Spain nor Ireland saw mortgage securitization on a significant scale.2 Neither possessed government-sponsored mortgage underwriting entities like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. In Ireland the housing boom was, instead, an unplanned stepchild of economic success. As late as the mid-1980s, the Republic was regarded as one of Europe’s economic sick men, suffering from low productivity and anemic growth. Starting in 1986 the Irish government then balanced its budget, cut taxes, and devalued the exchange rate, enhancing the competitiveness of exports. Foreign companies were attracted by the opportunity to offshore technical manufacturing and services to a low-wage economy populated by native English speakers, not to mention by favorable tax treatment of corporate profits. Income and economic growth accelerated in the 1990s in response to this surge of inward foreign investment. Whether this rapid growth and rise in incomes justified an increase in the demand for housing on the scale subsequently observed is a separate question.

In Spain, the boom in residential construction was driven partly by Northern Europeans buying holiday homes in sunnier climes, not unlike the New Englanders attracted to Florida in the 1920s. This, however, does not explain the construction of multi-unit projects targeted at domestic households in the suburbs of the country’s large cities; some, like Ciudad Valdeluz just north of Madrid, became ghost towns when the bubble burst. For this, enthusiastic lending by Spanish banks, notably the regional savings banks or cajas, deserves the credit.

The role of bank lending points to the main thing Ireland and Spain shared with the United States, namely an enormous credit boom that pumped large amounts of cheap finance into the property sector. The difference was the source of the credit. In the United States the credit boom was driven by deregulation and securitization, aided and abetted by loose monetary policy and global imbalances. In Ireland, in Spain, and across much of Southern Europe, it was driven instead by the euro. That the impact of the euro would be felt most powerfully in property markets and at the periphery of the European economy was not something that had been anticipated by the currency’s founders. The euro project, like the larger process of European integration, had always focused on Germany and France. For France, integrating Europe’s national economies was a way of shackling German economic might. This was something French leaders prioritized after World War II. It was something to which they paid renewed attention following German reunification, which by expanding the Federal Republic threatened to destroy any semblance of parity between the French and German economies.

French leaders understood that anything that encouraged intra-European trade would give German firms a stake in peaceful coexistence. Building institutions of economic governance at the European level, they argued, would subject German policies to international oversight.3 They quickly identified a common currency as a key part of the apparatus deepening economic integration to the point where it became irreversible. As Jacques Rueff, the monetary expert who in his later years was economic advisor to Charles de Gaulle, put it, “Europe will be made of money, or it will not be made.” Or in the strikingly similar words of François Mitterrand, the French president in 1992–93, when the decision to move to monetary union was taken, “Without a common monetary system, there is no Europe.”4

With the passage of time, these statements have taken on an ironic coloration. Monetary integration has come to seem rather less than irreversible. A process designed to force Europe, and Germany in particular, toward deeper integration later threatened to tear the continent apart. But this was not the view at the time. The commitment of French leaders to economic and monetary integration was sincere. It was rooted in very real memories of more than a century of Franco-German conflict.

German politicians, for their part, saw Europe as a vehicle through which the post–World War II Bundesrepublik, stripped of the prerogatives of sovereignty, could pursue its foreign policy ambitions without threatening its neighbors. A European foreign policy, foreign minister, and army would provide cover behind which the country could advance its foreign policy goals. This had been Germany’s strategy for regaining first its sovereignty and then its place on the global stage ever since the approach was formulated by the country’s founding post–World War II chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. In the 1960s an equally wily German leader, Willy Brandt, then highlighted monetary union as part of the package of integrationist measures to be offered to Paris in return for France acceding to Germany’s foreign policy ambitions. This made monetary union a logical concession when Helmut Kohl, Germany’s longest-serving postwar chancellor and a disciple of Adenauer, sought to obtain French approval for German reunification.

Any capsule description of a process as complex as European integration is, necessarily, oversimplified. The relevant oversimplification here is that France sought economic integration, Germany sought political integration, and together these elements were the basis for a deal. To be sure, there were also those in Germany, notably officials of the central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, who opposed monetary integration in advance of political integration, and those in France, leading technocrats among them, who embraced political as well as economic integration. Still, that was the essence of the deal. The French achieved quick results with the creation of the European Economic Community in 1957, the Single Market free of barriers to the movement of merchandise, capital, and labor in 1992, and the euro in 1999. The Germans made slower progress but remained no less committed to their goal.

German politicians understood, of course, that it was easier to engage in a bit of economic engineering than to forge a political union. The design of a freetrade area, a single market, and even a common currency could be delegated to technocrats. If there were national sensitivities, protections could be added. To avoid antagonizing powerful special interests, French and German farmers could be extended special treatment when Europe created its free-trade area. Although a single market might require a powerful European commissioner to apply the common competition policy, sensitive areas like bank regulation could be left to national authorities. To reassure Germany that the euro would not be an engine of inflation, member states could be required to make their central banks independent in the manner of the Bundesbank, as Kohl insisted.

Political union, as predicted, was a harder nut to crack. Transferring sovereignty to the European Union was sensitive even in Germany, despite championship of the idea by successive political leaders. Although nationalism was not an honorable German instinct in the second half of the twentieth century, neither was it absent. French leaders were prepared to pursue political integration only on the assumption that they would occupy high positions and set the rules. Everyone therefore understood that, compared to the transition to monetary union, which took seven years from when the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992 to when the euro came into being in 1999, the transition to political union would take longer.

The problem was that Germany had not signed up for economic and monetary union without political union. And what was problematic politically was problematic economically. A smoothly functioning monetary union requires an interstate system of taxes and transfers like that in the United States. A single currency and single financial market require a single regulator, a common deposit insurance scheme, and a bad-bank resolution fund—what subsequently came to be known as banking union.5 But if fiscal policy decisions were going to be made at the European level, this would be tolerable only if there also existed a European Parliament with voice and authority sufficient to hold decision makers accountable for their actions. If there were going to be fiscal transfers to troubled member states, then there would have to be stronger rules for national fiscal policies, along with adequate oversight of those enforcing them. If there was going to be banking union, there would have to be political institutions capable of holding the continent’s supranational bank regulators accountable for their actions.

European leaders thought they could force the pace by creating the euro. Once monetary union was a fact, even nationalistic politicians would have to concede that political union was needed to make it work. As Joschka Fischer, the charismatic Green Party politician serving as Germany’s vice chancellor and foreign minister, put the point in a 1999 speech to the European Parliament, “with the introduction of the euro . . . an important part of national sovereignty, to wit monetary sovereignty, was passed over to a European institution. . . . The introduction of a common currency is not primarily an economic, but rather a sovereign and thus eminently political act . . . political union must be our lodestar from now on; it is the logical follow-on from Economic and Monetary Union.”6

This was by no means exclusively a German view. Romano Prodi, the Italian politician serving as president of the European Commission when the euro was established, minced no words in an interview with the Financial Times in 1999, saying “[My] real goal is [to draw on] the consequences of the single currency and create a political Europe.” Or, in the still-blunter language of Jean-Luc Dehaene, the French-born prime minister of Belgium, “Monetary union is the engine of political union.”

An engine is prone to backfiring when its fuel is ignited prematurely. The blind faith of European policy makers in the euro was not unlike the faith invested in the gold standard in the 1920s: put monetary institutions in place, and the political adaptations required for their smooth operation will follow. These were the functionalist arguments that economists supplied to receptive officials.

Specialists in European politics, better attuned perhaps to the realities, were skeptical of this functionalist logic. Just because a certain set of political institutions is required to support a certain set of economic arrangements is no guarantee that they will be produced.7 Politics, rather than responding to economic logic, has a life of its own.

The founding fathers of the euro had assumed that Europe would have several decades to complete its banking, fiscal, and political union. Unfortunately, the euro area was sideswiped by the financial crisis and the Great Recession, which laid bare the still-incomplete nature of their construct. The idea that monetary union could proceed without political union turned out to be a fatal mistake. That Ireland, Spain, and other countries at the periphery of the European Union were among the founding members of the euro area was another surprise to the architects of the single currency. Study after study had shown that a core of strong and stable Northern European countries—Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and perhaps Denmark—would find it easiest to cope with a one-size-fits-all monetary policy. Ireland, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece, where conditions were different, would find the consequences of a common monetary policy less comfortable. It was therefore assumed that monetary union would be limited to that core of strong and stable Northern European countries.

But Ireland was already in the process of moving to Europe’s core from its periphery. With an average growth rate of more than 6½ percent between 1990 and 1998, it had already attained one of the continent’s highest per capita incomes. Spain, in contrast, was growing only half as fast, making the country’s argument, that it was similarly prepared to adopt the euro, more problematic.8 Here, however, procedure trumped prudence. The decision to proceed with monetary union, like most EU decisions, was taken by consensus. And if unanimity was required, then countries like Spain, if denied membership, could block the process. Procedurally, there was no way to move forward without their participation.9

Even Greece, whose budget deficit was far too large to be driven through the generous loopholes of the Maastricht Treaty, could extract a promise that it would be permitted to join after a couple of years if it made at least cosmetic progress on the fiscal front. It had aid with the optics from Goldman Sachs, which helped the Greek government create the appearance that it had a manageable debt by arranging a deal whereby it got immediate cash, obviating the need to issue additional bonds, in return for pledging future revenues first from its national lottery and then from landing fees collected at its airports. The deals in question were booked as currency trades rather than loans, hiding them in plain sight, or at least hiding them from the European Commission.10

And so the euro came to the periphery. It stimulated housing markets by reducing interest rates, which in turn cheapened the cost for households, construction companies, and property developers of borrowing to speculate in real estate. In the 1990s, Spain, Portugal, and Italy had been forced to pay interest on ten-year government bonds at twice the rates demanded of Germany and the rest of Northern Europe.11 These double-digit interest rates now came down with the approach of monetary union. Investors reasoned that members of the euro area would no longer be able to inflate their way out of trouble now that they had Germanic hard money, in quantities determined by a Germanic central bank. European rules, not to mention the absence of a central bank at the national level to provide money finance for budget deficits, would require governments to follow disciplined fiscal policies. Stability having been enhanced, growth would accelerate. Per capita incomes would converge toward the European norm. Faster growth and stronger budgets would ensure the sustainability of public debts.12 These assumptions were the basis for the popular strategy of purchasing the bonds of Southern European governments in the expectation that their prices would rise as yields fell. This strategy acquired its own name, as fashionable investment strategies do. It was the “convergence play.”13

The result was a massive flow of capital into the bond markets and banking systems of Spain, Portugal, Greece, and Ireland from the rest of Europe and the rest of the world.14 Between 2004 and 2007 those inflows far exceeded the 4 percent of GDP guideline used by the International Monetary Fund as a caution light of risks to stability. That the IMF did not issue warnings of any consequence, despite this violation of historical norms, is itself indicative of the presumption that the situation in Europe was different. Monetary union was a fact. It was irreversible. There was no more reason to worry about current account imbalances and capital flows between euro-area member states than there was about current account imbalances and capital flows between the fifty US states. The bulk of the foreign capital imported by Southern European countries was used to finance private investment, not government budget deficits, the Greek exception notwithstanding. This private investment promised to make the recipient economies more productive, enabling them to repay what they borrowed.

Hence the fact that capital was flowing from high-income countries like Germany to lower-income countries like Spain, Portugal, and Greece could be justified as a good thing. Low-income countries with the capacity to grow fast had the most scope for putting additional capital to work. And with the advent of the euro, the presumption was that the formerly backward economies of Southern Europe now possessed this capacity in abundance. It was not unlike the manner in which the flow of capital from China to the United States was regarded. It too was justified as signifying the best of all possible worlds. The German Federal Republic, in contrast, entered the euro as a poor performer. It was still digesting the former East Germany. Unemployment was high, especially in the eastern Länder. Its labor markets were inflexible. All the more reason, it was argued, to invest in the small countries of the European periphery rather than the large, moribund German economy.

Soon thereafter Germany would adopt the “Agenda 2010” reforms of Gerhard Schröder’s coalition of Social Democrats and Greens. Schröder was an unlikely candidate to push through radical reforms of the German labor market. His father having died fighting on the eastern front during World War II, he worked as principal breadwinner for his family from the age of fourteen as a building laborer, embracing the militant pro-union politics of his workmates. Schröder then put himself through law school before becoming active with the Young Socialists and serving as defense attorney for Horst Mahler, founder of the notorious Baader-Meinhof Gang, the group of radical anti-capitalist students-cum-terrorists. When elected to the Bundestag, he flaunted his man-of-the-people credentials by wearing a sweater rather than the customary suit.

Over time Schröder moved to the center, as politicians with national ambitions often do. By the time he succeeded to the chancellorship in 1998, the German public, having suffered through years of high unemployment, was ready for something different. Shunning class warfare, the now conservatively suited chancellor cast himself as modernizer, embracing a strategy that combined social justice with economic efficiency in the manner of Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. Just as only Nixon could have gone to China, only Schröder could have convinced Germany’s powerful unions that wage moderation, decentralized bargaining, and a reformed welfare state were in their interest. Moving to the center also made political sense: Schröder’s Social Democrats faced relatively little political competition from farther left; thus, they had an incentive to move to the middle in order to compete, electorally, with the more conservative Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats.

But in the early years of the euro, Schröder’s reforms had not yet been adopted, much less had time to work.15 Productivity was growing faster in Southern Europe than in a still-moribund Germany. All this fed expectations of convergence between Europe’s north and south, which made the south the obvious destination for footloose finance.

Juxtaposed against this reassuring backdrop, however, was a trio of disquieting facts.16 First, saving declined in Southern Europe in the period of strong capital inflows. Evidently, the region was becoming increasingly dependent on foreign finance. This was the opposite of the pattern in China and other fast-growing Asian economies, where savings rates were not just high but rising. It was worrisome insofar as the capital inflows, and therefore the investment they financed, could stop at any time.

A second disturbing trend was the deterioration in competitiveness across Europe’s southern tier. Following the 2003 Schröder reforms, unit labor costs in German manufacturing stopped rising, reflecting strong productivity growth and the unions’ newfound acceptance of wage moderation. In countries like Spain, in contrast, wage increases far outstripped productivity. The euro promised faster growth, Spanish trade unionists were told. If their future incomes were going to be higher, they reasoned, they might as well partake of the benefits now. The reality, of course, was that faster growth was not guaranteed. Unit labor costs in Spanish manufacturing rose between 1999 and 2008 by a startling 40 percent relative to those in Germany. There was no way Spanish firms could compete.

Conditions in Greece, Portugal, and Italy were no better. Costs of production rose precisely when Germany, implementing its Agenda 2010 reforms, was pushing them down. Once upon a time, the impact of lower labor costs and improved cost competitiveness in Germany would have been offset by a stronger deutschmark. But this was no longer the case now that Germany had the euro.

And the problem was not just German competition. In addition, there was China. This was when Chinese exporters of garments, footwear, and other manufactures moved up-market, invading the product space of Greek, Portuguese, and Italian firms.17 It was too much to ask of European leaders, when laying plans for the euro, that they should have anticipated the intensification of Chinese competition. In the event, China’s incursion into Europe was another surprise that upset the euro applecart.

The third disturbing trend was that the flow of capital into peripheral Europe encouraged residential construction, not fixed investment.18 Residential construction does little to enhance productivity. The surge in construction activity should have been a warning sign. Even more than in the United States, banks were the conduits for these capital flows. Though US banks were highly leveraged, European banks were more highly leveraged still. US banks were levered by a factor of twelve, according to the conventional metric of bank assets to capital.19 European banks, by the same measure, were levered by a factor of twenty.20 In effect, European banks maintained a capital cushion of just 5 percent as protection against losses. This twenty-times leverage, moreover, was only the industry average. Some of the largest banks, like the German giant Deutsche Bank, outdid themselves by boosting their leverage to 40:1.

This was more borrowing and faster expansion of loan and investment books than could be financed simply by accepting retail deposits. Even more than in the United States, European banks supplemented their deposit liabilities by tapping the wholesale money market. They issued short-term debt. They borrowed from other bank and nonbank financial institutions, renewing those borrowings every night. In the first quarter of 2007, the loan-todeposit ratio of European banks was close to 175 percent, far in excess of that in the United States. That this was true for Europe as a whole meant the phenomenon was not merely banks in Southern Europe borrowing from banks in Northern Europe. European banks as a group were also borrowing from other parts of the world, including the United States, and using the proceeds to fund speculative investments.

This process had several important implications. First, it rendered banks financing illiquid investments in real estate vulnerable to liquidity crises. Although demand deposits are liquid—as their name implies, they can be withdrawn on demand—the individuals holding those deposits can be slow to respond to events. Not so the wholesale money lent by banks to one another, which is not covered by deposit insurance. News about problems with a bank’s loans and investments might make it impossible to roll over what it had borrowed. Even if the news was exaggerated—even if the bank was in fact solvent—it might nonetheless experience a liquidity crisis, forcing it to engage in a fire sale of assets or appeal for official assistance. A second implication was that banking systems, and indeed individual banks, were allowed to grow very large. In 2007, when the crisis first lapped up on Europe’s shores, the liabilities of BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank exceeded 80 percent of the gross domestic products of France and Germany, respectively. The liabilities of the Belgian-Luxembourg bank Dexia and the Dutch bank Fortis exceeded, by a wide margin, the GDPs of their respective home countries. Not surprisingly, these were all banks that would play leading roles in the crisis that followed.

Third, the dramatic expansion of bank balance sheets allowed even more credit to flow into the booming housing markets of the Eurozone periphery. This lent still more impetus to the run-up in housing prices and the construction boom. It rendered Spain’s regional savings banks more heavily exposed to the housing market. And for especially voracious banks for which even this exposure was not enough, more could be obtained by loading up on the mortgage-related securities of US banks. The result was the bizarre situation in which European banks borrowed dollars from US financial institutions in order to buy derivative securities issued off balance sheet by those same US financial institutions. This was vendor finance with a vengeance.21

In the run-up to the crisis, American officials like Governor Bernanke focused on the connections between the country’s trade and budget deficits. They pointed to a single factor, namely the net flow of capital from the “savings glut countries” of Asia and the Middle East, as financing both the US trade and budget deficits, and raised troubling questions about what would happen if for any reason the savings glut countries suddenly turned reluctant to finance those deficits. But in focusing on the trade and budget deficits and on the net capital flow, they missed what turned out to be more important, namely the gross flow of finance from Europe into the increasingly risky securities that underwrote investment in the US housing market. There was no net capital flow between the United States and Europe. Trade between the two regions was broadly balanced. But there was an immense flow of European funds into US mortgage-backed securities and their derivatives, matched by an equal and offsetting flow of bank lending from the United States to Europe.

It was this “banking glut” and not Mr. Bernanke’s “savings glut,” and its implications for the housing market and not for the budget deficit, that mattered for what followed.22 But the United States had an extensive recent history of budget deficits and trade deficits; hence there was no deficit of attention to these imbalances. In contrast, there was no precedent, historical or otherwise, for the kind of housing-market boom that developed after the turn of the century, and no precedent for the vendor finance fueling it. Their historical perspective thus informed the risks that policy makers perceived and, equally, the risks they missed. How were these extraordinary financial circumstances allowed to arise? Why did so many supposedly shrewd observers fail to appreciate the risks posed by this overgrown financial system?

Answers to these questions start with the observation that Europe’s financial system had always been more bank-based than that in the United States. In the US, banks provided just 30 percent of mortgage lending and 30 percent of corporate funding. In Europe they provided 80 percent of mortgages and nearly 90 percent of corporate loans. If there was going to be an expansion of financial activity in Europe, then the banks, which dominated the financial system, were bound to be in the vanguard.

In addition, big European banks were universal. Unencumbered by the equivalent of Glass-Steagall restrictions, they offered their clients the entire range, or “universe,” of financial services. Regulators had traditionally gauged the adequacy of bank capital by placing investments into buckets distinguished by risk, and attached a simple leverage ratio to each. The regulator would then compute the share of the bank’s assets in each bucket and determine the maximum amount of leverage permitted for the portfolio as a whole. This was the approach taken in the agreement on capital adequacy negotiated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 1988.

But big European banks complained that these rules of thumb failed to take into account the diversified nature of their business. If at the same time losses on assets in one bucket went up, losses on assets in another bucket went down, then the portfolio as a whole would be little affected. In a recession, when interest rates and corporate profits both declined, the banks might enjoy capital gains on their holdings of government bonds (the prices of which rose when interest rates fell) at the same time they suffered losses on corporate loans. Europe’s large, widely diversified banks argued that they could therefore hold less capital as a cushion against losses. They could compute the riskiness of the portfolio using their internal models, and regulators could use the results to set capital requirements accordingly.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision bought into these arguments when it issued its revised capital accord, known as Basel II, in 2004. In 2005 the European Parliament endorsed a capital requirements directive authorizing the adoption of Basel II, and EU regulators moved to implement it in 2007. US regulators were slower to embrace Basel II in what, in hindsight, looks to have been an exceptional fit of prudence. More generally, the European authorities claimed with no little pride that they were the most sophisticated regulators on the planet. Spanish regulators trumpeted the virtues of their system of dynamic provisioning under which banks were required to put aside reserves in good times to cover losses in bad times.23 In the event, it turned out that this system did too little to restrain the boom and afforded an inadequate cushion for the losses incurred subsequently. It gave officials and bankers a false sense of security. In bank regulation, it would appear, sophistication is no virtue.

But at the root of the problem was the euro. Relieved of currency risk, banks felt free to borrow and lend abroad. Cross-border competition intensified. Formerly sleepy regional banks, their profits squeezed, took more risk in the gamble to survive. Quasi-public entities like the German bank IKB, perceiving inadequate opportunity in industrial and infrastructure lending, loaded up on high-yielding American CDOs. They understood that their governments, even though espousing the rhetoric of the single market and the level playing field, were invested in the survival of their national champions. Confident that the official sector would come to the rescue if their risky bets failed, they rolled the dice.

In the United States, the 2007–08 crisis originated in the shadow banking system—in the hedge funds, special purpose vehicles, and derivatives markets operating largely outside the regulatory net, before migrating to the commercial banks. In Europe, in contrast, the crisis originated in financial institutions firmly inside the regulatory perimeter. Europe’s crisis was a banking crisis from the start. This buildup of vulnerabilities bore more than a passing resemblance to the 1920s. There was the rapid expansion of credit in an American financial system freed of regulatory restrictions. The credit boom in the United States was mirrored by equally dramatic credit expansion in Europe. There was growing competition between bank and nonbank financial institutions and risk taking by financial firms gambling to survive. The length of the lending chain, which connected mortgage brokers and banks to security originators and foreign investors, encouraged opportunism up and down the line.

The credit boom was fueled by lax monetary policy in the United States, again similar to the situation in the 1920s. It was accentuated by the cross-border capital flows spawned by the chronic imbalances between the United States and China. Europe replicated those imbalances at the regional level, shipping large amounts of finance from the continent’s north to the south. Much as the restoration of the gold standard encouraged reckless lending in the 1920s by convincing naïve investors that currency risk was a thing of the past, the advent of the euro allowed policy makers to argue, contrary to logic, that not just currency risk but also credit risk had disappeared. Investors swallowed the bait hook, line, and sinker.

As in the 1920s, housing was again the main beneficiary of the credit boom. But where the housing boom of the 1920s had been concentrated in the sparsely populated state of Florida, this one infected not just the United States but also Spain, Ireland, and other European countries. As a result, the boom and bust threatened the stability not only of individual bank and nonbank financial firms but the system as a whole, more so in that those financial institutions were more highly leveraged and thinly capitalized than eighty years before.

Careful students of the 1920s may have been aware of the parallels. But not even they were ready for what came next.
