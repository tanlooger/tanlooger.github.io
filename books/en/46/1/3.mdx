title: Chapter 3 Competing on a Violent Scale
---



The motivation for the Fed’s 1927 interest rate cut may have been to encourage gold to flow to London, but there were other effects. Another immediate consequence was to encourage investors to search for yield abroad. In a period when US treasury bonds returned 3½ percent, bonds issued by foreign governments yielded two and three times as much. Restoration of the gold standard created the impression that there would no longer be exchange rate changes to disturb the returns. One is reminded of the response to the euro, when large amounts of capital flowed from Northern Europe, where interest rates were low, to Southern Europe, where they were two or three times as high. In neither case did the story end happily.

Foreign bonds were not an asset class traditionally favored by American investors. US banks had been prohibited from branching abroad prior to the Federal Reserve Act. They consequently lacked the connections to originate and underwrite foreign loans. There was only limited issuance of foreign dollar bonds in New York before the turn of the century, mainly on behalf of Canadian and Mexican borrowers. Montreal placed a $3 million bond issue in the United States in 1899, and the Hamilton Electric Light and Cataract Power Company sold $750,000 of bonds later the same year. In 1898–99 the Mexican state of Jalisco and the city of Saltillo sold $1.7 million of dollar bonds in New York for construction of sewers and waterworks.

There were also scattered US holdings of European debt securities denominated in the borrowers’ own currencies that had been issued in London or another European financial center and resold to American investors. But investing in such securities required financial acumen and knowledge of foreign exchange markets, attributes that were not widespread in the United States. Consequently the amounts involved were small. By one estimate, foreign-currency securities held by US investors came to just $15 million at the end of 1899.1 This can be placed in perspective by noting that the U.S. Steel Corporation, on its establishment in 1901, immediately issued $300 million of bonds.

Between 1900 and 1913 foreign loan placements in New York picked up. American investors purchased bonds issued by the London Underground. They purchased securities floated by the Japanese government for financing its war with Russia. But the balance of asset trade was in the other direction.

With the outbreak of World War I, the belligerents sought to access the New York market. This elicited mixed reactions from American officials. The newly elected president, Woodrow Wilson, appointed fellow Democrat and longtime party favorite William Jennings Bryan as his secretary of state. The position was largely honorific, given that the State Department had just 150 employees in Washington, D.C. Still, Bryan could use his bully pulpit and rhetorical skills to advance his views. Ever the moralist (except perhaps in his incarnation as a shill for Florida real estate), Bryan was horrified by events in Europe and convinced that America should remain neutral at all cost. Specifically, he opposed bond sales on behalf of the belligerents as inconsistent with US neutrality. To circumvent his opposition, investment houses like J. P. Morgan & Co. were forced to portray their loans as no more than temporary credits, despite the fact that they were quickly securitized and sold on to the public.

With the sinking of the American liner Lusitania by a German U-boat in May 1915, an incident in which 128 American lives were lost, Bryan’s position became untenable. He speculated that the passenger liner may have been carrying munitions, arguing that this could justify the German action. Nearly a century later, in 2008, divers were finally able to confirm that Bryan was right.2 But this was not something that could be verified at the time. Seeing Wilson’s cabinet turning against him, Bryan resigned his post.

His resignation opened the floodgates. Between mid-1915 and early 1917, dollar loans to foreign governments, mainly those of France and Britain, exceeded $2 billion. This was a large amount of bond issuance even by the standards of U.S. Steel. Among other things, it had the effect of accustoming American investors to holding foreign bonds.

Following the US declaration of war in April 1917, the country’s foreign lending was channeled through governments, including loans by the American government to its European allies. American investors bought the Liberty Bonds of the US Treasury, receipts from which were used to fund war loans. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there had been a shortage of US government bonds for private purchase. Now, as a result of the war, the opposite was true. Propaganda was enlisted to create a demand commensurate with the new supply. The Liberty Loan campaign equated investment in government debt securities with patriotism and support for American boys in the trenches. Charlie Chaplin directed a ten-minute film entitled “The Bond” to advance the drive. It portrayed six kinds of bonds, including not just the financial but also those of friendship and sexual attraction. Nine million posters were printed and distributed in support of the campaign. Small savers were induced to invest in debt securities for the first time and became accustomed to the practice. The repercussions would be far-reaching. International capital flows were slow to recover following the armistice, understandably given the still-chaotic state of affairs. But starting in 1923, reconstruction and stabilization loans on behalf of foreign governments were offered to the American investing public in growing numbers. Chief among these were loans to Europe’s cash-strapped governments negotiated by the League of Nations. The first such loan was extended to the Austrian government in 1923, followed by loans to Hungary and Greece in 1924.

The US was not a member of the League, an isolationist Congress refusing to grant authorization. But the semi-official status of its loans, and their resemblance to Liberty Bonds, enhanced the appeal to American investors. Much like the presumption today that a country will not default on its obligations to the International Monetary Fund, there was a presumption that a country would not default on its League loans. Admittedly, there was the uncomfortable fact that the League itself committed no capital to the venture. But for investors less than reassured by the association with the League, there was also the fact that the League loans offered an interest rate more than twice that on US treasury bonds.

The signal financial event of 1924 was the Dawes Loan to Germany. This was negotiated not through the League, given US interest in the outcome, but by an ad hoc committee of experts, two from each of the creditor countries. The committee was chaired by the garrulous American banker Charles Dawes. Dawes came from a well-connected Midwestern family; his father, who built the Dawes Lumber Company into a thriving concern, served in Congress together with the young William McKinley. McKinley had enlisted Charles and his verbal powers of persuasion as a fund-raiser in the 1896 presidential campaign in which McKinley defeated Bryan. McKinley rewarded Dawes with appointment, at the age of thirty-one, as Comptroller of the Currency. Dawes later founded the Central Trust Company of Illinois, served as founding director of the Bureau of the Budget, returned to banking, and later served as first head of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, making full use of the revolving door between public and private sectors. These connections would come in handy when Dawes’ bank came to the brink of insolvency in 1932.3

Second in command of the US delegation was another, more junior, banker, the laconic Owen D. Young, whom Dawes appreciated for his acuity but also for his brevity, which left the loquacious chairman more time to talk. In 1911, as a young lawyer, Young had bested a General Electric subsidiary in a suit over territorial rights. Recognizing talent, GE hired him as chief counsel, from where he quickly ascended to company president. Young helped establish the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), a leading player in the radio boom of the 1920s. With the experience of the Dawes Plan under his belt, he led the second restructuring of German reparations in 1929 and was a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the crises of 1930–31. In 1932 he was prime mover in the adoption of the Veterans’ Bonus, which would provide useful stimulus to an otherwise moribund economy. He would play a role in the rescue of Dawes’ Central Republic Bank and Trust Company, also in 1932. He was cited as receiving special favors from J. P. Morgan and was cross-examined in the Pecora Commission hearings on financial fraud and misbehavior in 1933. If not quite the Forrest Gump of financial crises, Young was to figure in virtually every key financial event of the 1920s and 1930s.

Dawes, Young, and team formulated their strategy while en route to France. The captain of the liner America designated the children’s playroom for their conferences, Dawes later observing that “the significance of this choice was not wholly lost on us.”4 The delegation worked smoothly. In addition to being a good listener, Young had an ability to provide simple solutions to complex problems.

The Americans, with guidance from Young, agreed to press for back-loading Germany’s debt burden. Acknowledging that any proposal for reducing the overall obligation was likely to be a no-go in France, they sought instead to limit the short-term transfer while allowing payments to rise with the growth of the German economy.5

This was the proposal that Dawes, upon landing, presented to his European interlocutors. The European delegates were unenthusiastic, but he overcame their resistance by keeping them in continuous session until, exhausted, they gave in.6 This presumably accounts for the fact that the final report of the committee was unanimous, which in turn explains how its recommendations were then accepted by a conference of leaders in London.

Stabilizing the German currency required not merely adjusting the reparations burden, however, but also arranging an emergency loan, since the Reichsbank was out of funds. The conditions attached to this foreign assistance were daunting even by the standards of early-twenty-first-century Greece. Not only was the government required to balance its budget, inclusive of reparations, but a foreign agent general with far-reaching powers was appointed to enforce the requirement. The Reichsbank was prohibited from extending advances to the state, and investors in the Dawes Loan were given first lien on the revenues of the German state railways.

These measures were intended to reassure foreign investors, which in practice meant American investors. The French and British governments funded their shares of the Dawes Loan by allocating tax revenues for the purpose. The United States, market-oriented as always, relied instead on J. P. Morgan to sell the bonds to the public. The bankers worried that skeptical retail investors, who had not previously bought the bonds of foreign governments, would hesitate to purchase the obligations of what was recently an enemy power now saddled with reparations obligations extending decades into the future.

Such fears were unfounded. By 10:15 on the morning the bonds were issued, Morgan had received twice the number of purchase offers it required. The American public was clearly developing a healthy appetite for foreign debt securities.7

For his efforts, Dawes was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1925, along with Sir Austin Chamberlain, the British foreign secretary who had engineered the Locarno Agreements that contemporaries saw as making another European war inconceivable. By this time Dawes had been elected vice president of the United States, a position in which he was singularly ineffective even by the modest standards of that office. Dawes’ more enduring legacy was as a musician. His compositions included “Melody in A Major,” which became his signature anthem and was played in his honor at official functions. Lyrics were added by Carl Sigman in 1951, and the resulting composition was renamed “It’s All in the Game.” Tommy Edwards’ recording became a number-one hit in 1957, rendering Dawes the only US vice president and Nobel Prize winner to also be credited with a chart-topping song. Like the peace prize awarded Barack Obama, Dawes’ commendation was based more on hope than achievement. Even the hope was disappointed. As economic recovery got underway, German politicians and their public grew increasingly restive with the increase in payments required by the plan. The German debt load mounted, raising questions of sustainability.8 By 1929, even prior to the onset of depression, support for the Dawes Plan had collapsed. It was replaced by the Young Plan, devised by Dawes’ sidekick from 1924, which further scaled back Germany’s obligation. But all this was for the future. For the moment, the demand for German bonds was strong. The New York Fed’s 1924 interest-rate reduction, taken with the goal of helping Britain back onto the gold standard, whetted the appetite of investors for the high-yielding bonds issued to fund the Dawes Loan. It boosted the demand of American investors for foreign bonds generally. New dollar loans to foreign countries, funded almost entirely by placing bonds in the United States, ran at an annual average of $600 million between 1921 and 1923. In 1924 and again in 1925, with encouragement from the Dawes Plan and then the Fed, they rose to twice that level. In the second half of 1927 and the first half of 1928, following Strong’s second internationally motivated interest-rate cut, they rose further still.9

Initially, the US market in foreign bonds was the preserve of the same handful of investment banks that dipped a toe in this water before World War I, well-known names like J. P. Morgan & Co. and Kuhn, Loeb & Co. These august institutions knew the market and had contacts with foreign customers. They expected aspiring borrowers to come to them. But the atmosphere grew less cozy after 1924 with the entrance into the underwriting business of additional investment banks. The new entrants included old-line Boston and New York houses run now by an ambitious younger generation, as well as new financial firms. Deposit-taking commercial banks joined the fray, creating securities affiliates to underwrite bond issues on their behalf.

A company like J. P. Morgan had a reputation to preserve. Underwriting an issue with significant risk of default might jeopardize its ability, cultivated over the years, to get other banks to join the syndicate underwriting the issue and to foster confidence among investors. Newcomers to the underwriting business, in contrast, had little reputation to preserve. Their concern was the commission, which could amount to as much as 4½ percent of the value of the bonds. The commission was earned on placing the issue. It could not be clawed back if a bond lapsed into default.10

Nor did aspiring underwriters wait for borrowers to come to them. Instead they now ventured into the offices and homes of foreign government officials, including not a few to whom it had not occurred previously that they needed to borrow. Max Winkler, the self-appointed chronicler of this adventurous period, describes the case of a Bavarian town that sought to raise $125,000 for improvements to its power plant but was encouraged by its American underwriter to borrow $3 million to finance, in addition, a swimming pool, a bath house, and a gymnasium.11 A witness before the Senate Committee on Finance, investigating in 1932 why so many of these loans went bad, described how “at one time . . . there were 29 representatives of American financial houses in Colombia alone trying to negotiate loans for the national government, for the departments, and for other possible borrowers.”12 Borrowers were plied with food, wine, and other less licit pleasures, financed by the expense accounts of visiting bankers. The politically connected were offered finder’s fees for their influence. The Senate was told how those same expense accounts were used for “fixing” presidents and officials. Old-line bankers, like Thomas Lamont, a leading Morgan partner, warned of “American bankers and firms competing on almost a violent scale for the purposes of obtaining loans in various foreign money markets,” competition of a sort that “tends to insecurity and unsound practice.”13 But old-line bankers were increasingly outnumbered by their younger, less experienced, and more aggressive competitors.

Having secured the borrower’s business, the underwriter still had to interest the retail investor. Banks that had built bond departments to place Liberty Bonds now repurposed them to market foreign issues. Using their securities affiliates to circumvent laws prohibiting them from transacting across state lines, they sold bonds nationally. They placed articles in Harper’s and The Atlantic Monthly extolling the virtues of the new instruments. They opened store-front offices to encourage walk-in business. They hired salesmen schooled in high-pressure sales tactics.14

Finally, the promoters formed investment trusts, early-twentieth-century forerunners of mutual funds, to sell shares to small investors who would have otherwise found it difficult to obtain the benefits of a diversified portfolio of foreign bonds and to offer the services, however dubious, of professional management. A few investment trusts, a recent British import, had been established prior to the 1920s, but they were now founded in large numbers. There was also a tendency for investment trusts to be “closely intertwined,” as Eugene White politely puts it, with the banks sponsoring them, which encouraged bank clients to invest in securities through the affiliated trust.15 Whereas early investment trusts had tended to hold a fixed portfolio of securities, their more recently established competitors were actively managed—that is, they churned the portfolio. Investment trusts invested in other investment trusts, doubling the fees paid by their customers.16

The promotional push, together with the high interest rates on offer, was effective. In the words of Paul Einzig, the prolific British financial journalist, writing in 1931, “During the last seven years or so, bond-selling houses spared no effort to educate the American investor to appreciate the advantages of investing in foreign bonds. Through applying every device of their highly developed art of salesmanship they succeeded, between 1923 and 1928, in placing a formidable amount of foreign bonds of every description with the American public.”17

Formidable is the word. American investors provided fully 80 percent of the money borrowed by German public credit institutions between 1925 and 1928. They furnished 75 percent of that borrowed by the country’s local governments and 50 percent of loans to its large corporations.18 A loan to Austria financed the construction of a hydroelectric works. A loan to Belgium underwrote investments in roads and ports in the Congo. In all, European governments and corporations were the recipients of nearly half of all US foreign lending in the 1920s.

An additional one-quarter of foreign securities issued in the United States went to Latin America. In Argentina alone, US investors supplied long-term funding to permit the government to repay a short-term loan from the British government. Dollar bonds were floated to enable the Argentine authorities to acquire gold to back the national currency. Dollar bonds funded the construction and improvement of public works, including the railways, and extended the duration of their existing short-term debts. Dollar loans were made to provincial governments to replace expiring sterling credits and in anticipation of tax receipts. Local governments borrowed to build roads, bridges, schools, waterworks, sewage systems, and, critically for a meat-exporting country, ­cold-storage plants. Argentine municipalities borrowed to build and improve hospitals, power plants, parks, and streets. This was risky business, although it could be argued that it was not without logic. With the American economy growing rapidly, the US savings rate was high. As in early-twenty-first-century China, which similarly saw a high savings rate, prime-age workers at the saving stage of the life cycle had higher incomes than older individuals, now in retirement and dissaving. In Europe, where incomes were depressed by the war and postwar disruptions, savings rates were low. There was a shortage of capital to repair roads, bridges, and factories. That interest rates were higher in Europe than in the United States, which is what worked to attract US investors to foreign securities, flowed directly from this confluence of facts.

Making the case for investment in Latin America was harder. But Latin countries that had expanded their production and exports of agricultural commodities and raw materials during the war could claim that they were enhancing their capacity to earn foreign exchange and hence to service loans. With so much money on offer, it was not hard to make the case.

But even a process with an underlying logic can be pushed too far—a tendency that is not unknown in finance. Foreign loans to underwrite the reconstruction of war-damaged railways and ports or to build cold-storage facilities for Argentine beef exports were one thing; borrowing to build municipal swimming pools and bathhouses was another. With finance so easy, governments were tempted to engage in additional spending. Already in 1926 Schacht worried that all the capital flowing into Germany was encouraging excesses on the part of state and local governments.19 In May 1927 he instructed the banks to curtail their loans to the stock market in an effort to damp down the boom. But even though this led to a sharp fall in the stock market, it did nothing to discourage borrowing by German municipalities. And the higher interest rates induced by Schacht’s policy only made it more attractive for foreign investors to lend.

S. Parker Gilbert, the former US treasury undersecretary appointed as agent generation for reparations to carry out the Dawes Plan, warned of the risks posed by the torrent of foreign capital. German governments, he warned, were “overspending and overborrowing.” The economy was at risk of “overstimulation and overexpansion.” Sooner or later, doubts would develop about the sustainability of the process. At that point, the inflow of foreign capital would come to a sudden stop, resulting in “severe economic reaction and depression.”20

The parallels with the recent crisis are almost too obvious. Starting in 2004, a swelling chorus of voices cautioned about the ongoing flow of capital to the United States from China, Germany, and the oil-exporting countries. This was encouraging the profligacy of the US government, they warned, by enabling it to borrow at artificially low rates. The flow of cheap foreign finance would not continue indefinitely, and when it stopped the consequences would be challenging. As it happened, the crisis of which they warned was superseded by another, the collapse of US real estate prices and the market in subprime mortgages in 2006–07. Still, they had a point.

There were also differences. One is that global imbalances in the 1920s were tilted in the other direction: capital flowed from the United States, not toward it. The other is that the Cassandras who warned the process could not continue indefinitely and it was setting the stage for a crisis were right on both counts. When in 1928 the outflow came to a sudden stop, it plunged first Germany, then Latin America, and finally the world into precisely the “severe economic reaction and depression” of which Parker Gilbert, two years earlier, had warned. However frothy the market in foreign bonds, Wall Street was frothier still. On three of the first seven trading days of 1928, the number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded three million, a level that had been reached just eight times over the previous decade. From there, activity rose still higher. Evidently, the large investors clubbed together in pools organized by the likes of Billy Durant were being joined by a growing number of small savers. Individuals who had relied on professionals employed by investment trusts to manage their portfolios took to buying and selling securities directly. Brokerage firms opened branch offices featuring customers’ rooms fitted out with plush carpets and overstuffed chairs designed to create an ambience of comfort and security. Six hundred new customers’ offices were opened in 1928 and 1929.21 Additional rooms were created for female investors, in another sign of the times.22

The nature of the attraction is no mystery. Stocks yielded 38 percent in 1927, an extraordinarily high rate by historical standards. They yielded an even more impressive 44 percent in 1928. Credit was available for anyone seeking to share in these heady returns.23 The process was perversely self-financing, as credit booms are. The higher share prices rose, the more attractive it became for corporations seeking to finance their operations to issue additional equity rather than borrow from banks. This forced the banks to look for other lending opportunities, which they found in the stock market. As share prices then rose further, the collateral on which securities lending occurred became more valuable, justifying still more lending.24

The Fed’s detractors, both internal and external, criticized it for fanning the flames. By November 1927 James McDougal of the Chicago Fed (whose bank, recall, had resisted Strong’s proposal for an interest rate cut earlier in the year but was overruled), together with George Norris of Philadelphia, was advocating higher interest rates to stem the flow of credit into the stock market. Brokers’ loans had increased by more than $300 million in the previous five months. In December and January they then rose by an additional $500 million.

For the Open Market Investment Committee, this was finally too much. It agreed, starting in January 1928, to sell securities for cash in order to drain liquidity from the market. The next step was to make borrowing more expensive, with the goal of making it more costly to use credit to buy stocks on margin. Starting on January 25 and extending through the end of February, one Federal Reserve bank after another raised its discount rate. A second round of increases followed in April. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York then raised its discount rate for a third time in May. Although the rise in policy rates was designed to cool an overheated stock market, its effects were most pronounced in Europe. By now, warnings of unsustainable foreign borrowing were rife. With the Fed’s action boosting yields on short-term investments at home, foreign bond issuance fell off a cliff. US capital exports dropped from $530 million in the second quarter of 1928 to $120 million in the third. US lending to Germany, after running at more than $150 million in the second quarter, fell essentially to nil in the third. These events anticipated those of the summer of 2013, when the Federal Reserve mooted the possibility of “tapering” its purchases of US Treasury securities, leading investors to expect higher US interest rates, and emerging markets on the receiving end of capital inflows from the United States saw those flows stop and then reverse direction. The shock was uncomfortable, but it didn’t begin to approach the severity of that experienced by Europe and Latin America in 1928.

This now was the sudden stop of which Schacht, Gilbert, and others had warned. German industry, by this point all but wholly dependent on foreign finance, was caught in the vise. Producers were unable to borrow the funds needed to pay for materials and labor, while their customers were unable to obtain the credit needed to finance their purchases. Industrial production, hit from both sides, fell by nearly 10 percent in the second half of the year. Freight carried by the German state railways fell even faster. The number of unemployed more than doubled.

A normal central bank would have cut interest rates and made credit available to a weakening economy. But the Reichsbank was not a normal central bank. Maintenance of gold convertibility, as a bulwark against inflation, was its priority. To limit the loss of reserves, it kept the discount rate steady at 7 percent, much higher than the levels prevailing in other European financial centers.

In January 1929, Schacht finally acknowledged deteriorating economic conditions and reduced the Reichsbank’s policy rate by half a percentage point, to 6.5 percent. When, as a result, gold started flowing out, he then reversed course, raising the discount rate by 100 basis points (meaning one full percentage point), to 7.5 percent. Not only did this deal an additional blow to an already weakening economy but, with confidence visibly deteriorating, the interest-rate hike did not even succeed in stemming the outflow of capital from Germany or the Reichsbank’s loss of gold.

Other European countries dependent on US lending were affected similarly. By the end of 1928 not just Germany but also much of Central Europe was in recession. Only Britain was different; the British economy, having begun to recover the momentum lost in the 1926 coal strike, was still in the expansion phase of the cycle. But starting in September 1928, the Bank of England, like its Central European counterparts, began losing gold to the United States as a result of tighter credit conditions in New York. Sooner or later, it was clear, Norman would be forced to raise interest rates.25 And it was increasingly questionable, in this light, whether and if so for how much longer the British economy would continue to expand. This money repatriated from Europe was now deposited in US banks, which lent it to brokers and dealers, adding more fuel to the Wall Street fire. The Fed might have attempted to discourage this use of credit with further increases in interest rates. But with the approach of the fall crop-moving season and then the 1928 presidential election, doing so was problematic. The demand for credit tended to spike during the crop-moving season that followed the harvest; with agricultural prices already weak, any attempt to raise rates further was certain to provoke protests in the South and Midwest. And like any central bank, the Fed hesitated to do anything that might excite the public in the run-up to an election.

The device to which the Fed instead turned in 1929 was to directly rein in bank lending to brokers and dealers. This was the policy of “direct pressure,” in which it arm-twisted member banks to limit lending for speculative purposes. New York City banks making loans to stockbrokers were warned that they would be cut off from the discount window. This was the board’s attempt to surgically deflate the bubble without also damaging the economy. The brain behind it was the much-maligned Adolph Miller, who, as a faithful believer in the real bills doctrine, emphasized the importance of keeping interest rates at a level suitable for the needs of commercial activity. Thus, direct pressure was a way of dealing with the threat posed by an overexcitable stock market—by “optimism gone wild and cupidity gone drunk,” in Miller’s words—without raising interest rates to a level inconsistent with the legitimate needs of business.26

A number of the Federal Reserve banks, led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, favored further increases in discount rates. The directors of the New York bank, many of them Wall Street veterans, were especially concerned about what was going on down the street. They understood better than their colleagues in Washington, D.C., that money was fungible. Thus, they appreciated that any reduction in lending by member banks in New York would be offset, at least to an extent, by lending on the part of nonmember banks, member banks elsewhere in the country, and insurance companies, corporate treasuries, investment trusts, and even foreign banks and individuals.27

Just as they predicted, this shadow banking system was quick to step into the breach. In the first quarter of 1928, nonbank sources funded nearly half of all broker’s loans. In the first half of 1929, as the growth of lending by money center banks was restrained by pressure from the Fed, nonbank sources accounted for fully 72 percent of the total. All the while, the volume of broker’s loans moved up. That said, it moved up less quickly than it would have if the New York City banks had not felt the Fed’s official pressure, and it moved up less quickly than needed to satisfy demand. Indicative of this fact is how interest rates on call loans continued to rise, pushing up other short-term interest rates in sympathy.

But those higher rates also made life more difficult for business. Reflecting tighter money and credit, the economy showed signs of decelerating in mid-1929. Building activity softened. State and local governments postponed construction projects owing to higher borrowing costs. Weak conditions abroad, reflecting the stop in US lending, showed up in weak American exports.

There has been much debate about who was right and who was wrong in this contest between the proponents of direct pressure and higher interest rates. In the light of recent experience, the answer is clear. We now understand that the best response for a central bank confronted with this kind of dilemma is to assign monetary policy, in this case its lending rate, to the needs of the economy while using regulatory tools like ceilings on loan-to-value ratios for home mortgages and limits on lending to particular sectors (what we would now call macroprudential policy) to address financial risks. This was precisely the intuition of those who advocated direct pressure in 1929: leave interest rates at a level appropriate for the economy and use other tools to limit lending to the stock market.

We now better appreciate the value of that intuition, because this is precisely what the Fed and other US agencies neglected to do in 2005–06, when they failed to use macroprudential policy to clamp down on the flow of credit into US housing markets. Here is a clear case where the events of 2007–08 change how we think about 1929. Real bills may be a discredited doctrine, but the macroprudential policies espoused by Adolph Miller look considerably more sage and sensible in this light.

The problem in 1929 was implementation. It was that the central bank’s macroprudential tools were weak. The Fed could apply direct pressure only to member banks, leading to the substitution of nonmember and nonbank credit for bank credit to the stock market. This is a problem for modern macroprudential policy as well: when the authorities attempt to limit bank lending to a particular market, the property market for example, they see some substitution of nonbank credit for bank credit.28 The solution is to give the macroprudential policy maker regulatory authority over nonbank providers of credit—over insurance companies and the like—as well as over banks. It is to set the “regulatory perimeter” as wide as possible. This was similarly the problem for the proponents of direct pressure in 1929. But given the country’s ramshackle regulatory system—where member banks were overseen by the Fed, state banks that were not members were overseen by state regulators, foreign banks were overseen by foreign regulators, and insurance companies were overseen by state insurance departments and agencies, if at all—it was a problem they were unable to solve. With credit continuing to flow into the stock market in what officials saw as dangerous amounts, the Fed felt compelled to supplement its policy of direct pressure by raising rates in the summer of 1929, compromising the prospects for economic growth.

Fed Governor Ben Bernanke gave a speech in 2002 in which he warned against using monetary policy to prick a bubble, pointing to the catastrophic implications of the Fed’s attempt to do so in 1929. But he then went on, curiously, to also dismiss the 1920s policy of direct pressure as ineffectual.29 A better approach, he implied, was for the central bank not to attempt to lean against a bubble but rather to flood the markets with liquidity if it bursts. We now know that flooding the market with liquidity, or at least flooding the part of the market the Fed is capable of flooding, may not be enough to avert the worst. Better is to strengthen tools like direct pressure rather than to dismiss them because their effects are weak. But this was a lesson that the Bernanke Fed would have to learn the hard way.
