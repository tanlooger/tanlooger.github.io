It did not take long for financial excesses to migrate from Flagler Street to Wall Street. The same low interest rates and expectations of rapid growth that fueled speculation in property encouraged investment in stocks and bonds. Enthusiasm for stocks was further stoked by exaggerated expectations of the profitability of what might be referred to as, if an anachronism is permitted, a new generation of information technology companies. Much as the Internet was used in the 1990s to trumpet the wisdom of investing in Internet-related companies, radio was used in the 1920s to encourage investing in radio. Radio Corporation of America was one of the most widely traded stocks on Wall Street from the time of its initial listing in 1924.

RCA and the other highflyers were helped along by Wall Street insiders like Walter Chrysler and the Fisher Brothers, of Fisher Auto Body fame. These individuals, auto industry veterans more often than not, were led by the mercurial founder of General Motors turned financial speculator Billy Durant. Under Durant’s direction they formed syndicates to purchase RCA stock. They made the soaring price of RCA shares front-page news, attracting small investors and driving up prices still further. At this point the syndicate sold out, taking its profits and in so doing erasing earlier gains.1

But even these manipulations did not interrupt the upward trend in the market’s favorite. From 1925 to the peak in 1929, the price of RCA shares rose more than tenfold adjusted for splits. The first true growth stock, RCA’s price-earnings multiple ultimately exceeded 70. In the event, the company did not pay a dividend until 1937.

What was true of RCA stock was true generally. From early 1926 through mid-1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose without significant interruption. Whether and at what point this should be regarded as a bubble continues to be disputed. It is suggestive that the Dow and corporate dividends rose in lockstep through 1927, as if the run-up in stock prices was a reflection of improved corporate earnings. But in 1928, share prices decoupled from dividends. From this point the Great Wall Street boom—some would say the bubble—was on.2

There were as many explanations for the rise in share prices as there were pundits. Expert commentators pointed to expectations of accelerating dividend growth, reflecting the installation of electric motors and adoption of assembly line methods. General Motors was a leader in realizing the potential of these innovations under the direction of the MIT-trained engineer Alfred P. Sloan, who had assumed control when the overleveraged Durant was forced out in 1920.3 GM reported exceptionally strong profits in 1928, encouraging the belief that the same would be true of other technologically progressive firms. If so, investors overlooked the possibility that GM’s strong profitability reflected the fact that Henry Ford had closed down his Highland Park factory in May 1927 in order to retool from the Model T to the Model A, diverting purchases toward his competitor. If savvy investors didn’t understand the point, it was because GM’s management under Sloan—who was a pioneer not just in scientific management but also in investor relations—did its best to convince them that the surge in profitability was GM’s doing.4

The other obvious suspect was, as usual, the Fed. In 1927 the Reserve banks once more cut their policy rates to relieve the pressure on the Bank of England. Britain was still struggling to reduce the high labor costs with which it was saddled as a result of the return to gold in 1925. It had been hit in 1926 by a strike by coal miners protesting demands from their employers that they accept wage cuts of 25 percent. In addition, the Dawes Plan, which rescheduled Germany’s post–World War I reparations in 1924, permitted the country to make those payments by exporting coal.5 Germany’s reentry into the international coal market now depressed prices, further ratcheting up the pressure for the British industry to cut costs by any and all means. The coal strike lasted six weeks, during which production and exports were disrupted. The result was a deteriorating British balance of payments and gold losses for the Bank of England. Nor were the coal miners Montagu Norman’s only problem; he also had the German and French central banks to contend with. First the Reichsbank and then the Bank of France began withdrawing gold from London. The French and German central banks were not reassured by Britain’s contentious industrial relations. Not without reason, they saw gold as a better bet than sterling.

The resulting gold losses forced Norman to keep interest rates high, making for more stringent financial conditions. That in turn made things even more difficult for a British economy struggling to regain its footing.

Understanding how these tensions came about requires us to step back and consider the problem confronting the monetary experts who sought to reconstruct Europe’s trade and payments after World War I. Like Benjamin Strong, they were convinced that the gold standard was the only durable foundation on which to build. They worried, however, that there might not be enough gold to firmly sink the pilings. Wages and prices had risen sharply during World War I, but gold supplies, reflecting the foibles of the mining industry, failed to follow. The traditional way of squaring this circle was by pushing wages and prices back down. But doing so was no longer palatable politically, in the wake of the war. The electoral franchise was now broader; men who had so valiantly fought in the trenches could no longer be denied the vote. Labor movements grew more militant, as underlined by the British coal strike.

For all these reasons, a policy of wage and price reductions was no longer easy to implement. Nor could more gold for backing money supplies, commensurate with higher prices, be conjured out of thin air, or from under the ground. The only solution was to find a substitute that central banks could use to supplement their existing gold reserves—that they could use to back their issuance of money and credit. Here the obvious supplements were the bonds issued by the US and British treasuries, which in principle were as good as gold—that would, in other words, be readily exchangeable into the yellow metal once the international gold standard was restored.

The idea that central banks should supplement their gold reserves by holding the securities of governments like Britain’s was enthusiastically tabled by the British delegation to the international conference convened in Genoa in 1922. It was received with mixed feelings by other European countries anticipating that their securities would not enjoy the same privileged status. Moreover, anything that smacked of a relaxation of gold-standard disciplines raised a red flag in countries that suffered runaway inflation in the first half of the 1920s, Germany of course being the classic case in point. The hyperinflation that reached its chaotic climax in Germany in 1923 came to be seared, seemingly forever, in the country’s collective consciousness. It took place when the gold standard was in abeyance; indeed, it is inconceivable that such high inflation could have occurred were the money stock tied to supplies of gold. In France, inflation never quite reached hyperinflationary levels but nonetheless had the same socially corrosive effects. The French inflation similarly took place when the gold standard was suspended. There, too, inflation stabilization coincided with the gold standard’s restoration. French and German officials, rendered highly inflation-averse, therefore subscribed to a particularly rigid form of gold standard doctrine subsequently. The policies flowing from that doctrine ultimately created intractable problems not just for Germany and France but ultimately for the United Kingdom, the United States, and the world as a whole.

Inflation may be always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon, but in Germany and France it was more fundamentally a political phenomenon. At its root were the tangle between the two countries over reparations and the division between business and labor as to who would bear the cost not just of those transfers but also of basic social services. Following the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in that other famous Hall of Mirrors, the Inter-Allied Reparations Commission had set Germany’s reparations bill at 269 billion gold marks, nearly 200 percent of GDP.6 This immense sum was unrealistic and unattainable, as John Maynard Keynes, the lead treasury representative to the Paris peace conference, argued in The Economic Consequences of the Peace, the December 1919 broadsheet that made him a public figure. Economically, forcing the country to export a multiple of what it imported in order to make large transfers to foreigners threatened to turn Germany’s terms of trade (the price of what it exported relative to the price of what it imported) against it, rendering those transfers still harder and, in the limit, impossible to achieve.7 Politically, reparations fanned international tensions, to put an understated gloss on the point.

Not only were the Allies’ reparation demands enormous, but payments were scheduled to continue for forty-two years. Imposing this heavy burden on future generations kept alive the question of who was responsible for starting the war, and then for losing it. This in turn inflamed the debate over who should now bear the cost of repairing the damage. Socialists insisted that business should pay through a one-time levy on business assets, or “seizure of real values.” In the spring of 1921 the German Social Democratic economics minister Robert Schmidt proposed that the wealthy should be required to turn over 20 percent of their stocks and bonds and that a 5 percent tax should be paid on the value of landed property. Business and property owners were aghast. As an alternative they constructively suggested raising sales and excise taxes, which conveniently fell on workers.

Equally predictably, the fact that a substantial fraction of tax revenues would be devoted to funding transfers to foreigners reinforced the opposition of both sides to any increase in rates. In the end, the decision taken was to rely on sales and excise taxes, though not heavily enough to close the fiscal gap. Notwithstanding these constraints, the German government initially pursued a policy of fulfillment. This meant making an effort to meet the terms of the reparations agreement, in the hope that good behavior would be rewarded. But rewards were not much on the minds of the French, who had problems of their own, which they blamed on the Germans. The French right wing, in particular, saw economic and financial concessions as a sign of weakness that would only encourage nationalist tendencies in Germany. It followed that the political strength of the center-right Bloc national, in power from 1919, made compromise unlikely.

In January 1923 the French communicated their response to German requests for concessions in no uncertain terms. Under instructions from the prime minister and minister of foreign affairs Raymond Poincaré, the French army reentered the Ruhr Valley, Germany’s western industrial flank, with the goal of extracting reparations by force. Railway and mine workers sat down on the job, and the Reichsbank, at government instruction, printed the paper marks that businesses paid their workers.

Poincaré’s role in these events, as in the subsequent French inflation and stabilization, was controversial. The French leader was born in 1860 in Bar-leDuc, not far from France’s eastern border. As a child he was prudent and politic; one story has him always carrying an umbrella to school, whatever the weather. He was just a week short of his tenth birthday, in 1871, when, with the defeat of the French Imperial Army, Prussian troops occupied his native Lorraine. Young Raymond’s bedroom was taken over by a Prussian officer, and the family was forced to remain in the upper floor of its house for the better part of three years.

From this, one imagines, flowed the mature Poincaré’s unbending attitude toward Germany, his refusal to offer concessions on the reparations issue, and his readiness to use military means to extract them. In the words of the British prime minister, David Lloyd George, “M. Poincaré was a Lorrainer born in a province repeatedly overrun and ravaged by Teutonic hosts . . . he himself twice witnessed the occupation of his own cherished home by German troops [the second time being in World War I]. . . . M. Poincaré is cold, reserved, rigid, with a mind of unimaginative and ungovernable legalism. He has neither humor nor good humor.”8

This evaluation was harsh and condescending, as was not infrequently the case with Lloyd George’s appraisals of his political rivals.9 Still, it conveys a sense of the broader context causing French leaders to frame the reparations issue as they did. Among the casualties of the Ruhr occupation were Weimar’s fragile finances. Although the cost of goods and services purchased by the government rose in step with the price level, taxes were paid on earlier incomes and lagged behind. The 10 percent tax on wages, deducted at the source, remained in the hands of employers for two weeks, at the end of which it was paid to the government. With prices doubling every fortnight, the consequences for the public finances were dire.

On March 23 Berlin imposed an additional penalty on anyone who delayed payment of taxes. But the new measure did not begin to correct the problem. The government’s finances deteriorated further, forcing still greater reliance on the printing press. Firms, banks, and individuals devoted more and more time to minimizing the impact of the inflation on their personal and corporate finances and less and less to productive activity.

Something had to give. That something, in the end, was French public opinion and German business. For German coal and steel magnates like Hugo Stinnes with investments in the Ruhr, the passive resistance was a disaster. Much like the Scottish-American industrialist Andrew Carnegie, Stinnes had worked his way up from modest means, acquiring a constellation of businesses centering on the coal, steel, and shipbuilding industries and enhancing their efficiency by placing them under one managerial roof. The scale of his business empire meant that Stinnes stood to take large losses if coal mining was immobilized for an extended period.

In September 1923, Stinnes and other leading industrialists therefore agreed to pay back taxes and make coal deliveries directly to France. Berlin agreed to call off the passive resistance. Paris signaled a willingness to reconsider the reparations bill. This renegotiation then followed with the formation of the Dawes Commission at the end of November.

Rudolph Havenstein, the lawyer and civil servant who had served as president of the Reichsbank since 1908, long denied the existence of a connection between his policies of providing cash in return for government and private paper on the one hand and inflation on the other, preferring to blame the price increases on foreign speculators. Havenstein’s hand was strong, in that his appointment was for life. But the evidence against his position was, by now, overwhelming. The passive resistance having collapsed, his board turned against him. It announced that the Reichsbank would no longer provide cash and credit in return for the emergency notes issued by German business.10 And to ensure that the central bank would not abandon its newfound firmness, the government established the office of the Currency Commissioner and authorized its occupant to issue a parallel and hopefully stable currency, the rentenmark. To this office it appointed a well-known banker with political connections, Hjalmar Schacht. Schacht took up the position on November 13.

This marked the death of the hyperinflation and, as it turned out, of Havenstein himself, who suffered a fatal heart attack on November 20, the same day Germany’s currency was stabilized against the dollar. The government now moved to have Schacht head the Reichsbank as well. Never one reluctant to engage in self-promotion, Schacht went on to claim that he had engineered the stabilization. The fact of the matter was that he was fortunate enough to assume his position as central banker just as the problem was solved.

As the printing presses slowed, the government’s accounts strengthened of their own accord. The hyperinflation was history. But it was not history that was quickly forgotten. This background explains how the Reichsbank became wedded to an unvarnished version of the gold standard. It explains why its successor, the Deutsche Bundesbank, continued to view the world through the lens of the 1920s, not just after World War II but, amazingly, into the twenty-first century—and even after it was absorbed into the European System of Central Banks. France too suffered from chronic budget deficits. The coalition government formed by the Bloc national of conservative parties, which held power from 1919 through 1924, succeeded periodically in balancing the “ordinary” budget of current expenditures but couldn’t agree on how to finance the “recoverable” budget of postwar reconstruction costs, so called because there was the expectation, or at least the hope, that these might be recovered from the Germans. At some level, budget deficits were not entirely undesirable, since they indicated that France was incapable of financing its reconstruction on its own. As the British treasury expert Ralph Hawtrey put it, for a French government to balance the recoverable budget “would have been an unpatriotic act, an expression of doubt as to the recovery of reparations in full.”11

Leaving aside reparations, the obvious solution to the fiscal problem would have been for the Left to agree to an increase in consumption taxes and the Right to concede modest levies on income and wealth. With a bit of shared sacrifice, the problem could have been solved. But there was little inclination to share sacrifice under the circumstances. It was not unlike the German situation except that the reparations shoe was on the other foot.

Meanwhile, the French treasury had to pay the bills. Borrowing long term was not an option. By 1923 the public debt exceeded 170 percent of GDP, given obligations incurred during the war and a deficit on the recoverable budget that now added 7 percent of GDP to the debt every year. Investors were willing to take only short-dated securities that would mature before potential problems of default and inflation materialized. Accordingly, the treasury issued short-term bills, known as national defense bonds to accentuate their connection with World War I. And whenever investors demonstrated a reluctance to purchase them, it asked the Bank of France to step in as purchaser of last resort.

Short-term debt poses risks to financial stability, as a long list of twentiethand twenty-first-century emerging markets have learned to their chagrin. Because short-term bills mature continuously, the government has to be able to roll them over—to issue new ones to replace those it pays off. If investors worry that inflation is poised to accelerate and therefore hesitate to purchase the new bills issued to replace those that have recently matured, the government will experience a funding crisis. It will be forced to turn to the central bank for cash. That cash, which the central bank provides by purchasing the government’s newly issued bills, will increase the money supply and in turn worsen inflation, validating investors’ fears. Thus, in the same way that a run on a bank by panicked depositors can be self-fulfilling, so too can be a run on a government’s short-term debt.

The result of this dependence on short-term borrowing and advances from the Bank of France was, predictably, repeated bursts of inflation, each more serious than the last. Again, a bit of inflation was not entirely undesirable from the standpoint of the diplomats, since it testified to the country’s inability to finance its reconstruction costs. But this was not the view of the French public, which, like all publics, felt inflation in the pocketbook. By the first quarter of 1924, at the height of the Ruhr occupation, retail price inflation had reached an alarming 36 percent.12 Share prices reacted badly: the index of 300 French securities fell sharply in March. More than a year into the Ruhr occupation, it was apparent that France would not be able to extract more blood from the German stone.

Forced to choose between compromise and hyperinflation, the French Parliament, still dominated by the Poincaré-led Bloc national, opted for compromise, though just barely. After a contentious debate lasting two months, legislators agreed to raise taxes by 20 percent across the board in a measure known as the double decime. Since it would take time for the additional tax revenues to materialize, J. P. Morgan, the French government’s banker, agreed to provide a $100 million credit conditional on the Parliament first passing the tax increase. Another £4 million (roughly $19 million at the prevailing exchange rate) was then extended by the investment bank Lazard Frères.

This was enough to stabilize the franc for the moment.13 But it was not enough to prevent inflation from resuming, since the underlying conflict was not resolved. It was not clear whether the double decime would be enough to balance the budget inclusive of reconstruction costs; the answer would depend on, among other things, taxpayer compliance. And it was not clear whether the middle classes, on whom the new taxes fell, would be prepared to accept them. The dispute over who would bear the burden heated up again as soon as it became evident, with the failure of the Ruhr invasion, that the answer was “not Germany.” In elections in May 1924, the Bloc national lost its majority in the Chamber of Deputies, as the unhappy middle-class voters who bore the brunt of Poincaré’s taxes turned out in large numbers. The Radicals (essentially, reformist bourgeois liberals), with support from the Socialists, then formed a left-of-center government, the Cartel des Gauches, headed by the longtime Radical politician Édouard Herriot, and sought to reopen the fiscal question. With the 1924 compromise in the balance, there was renewed uncertainty about whether the budget would be balanced. Herriot was sympathetic to the Bolshevik experiment, having visited the Soviet Union in 1922.14 Though not a Communist himself, his selection as prime minister alarmed the Right. Worried that his government might seek to close the deficit by imposing a levy on wealth, investors rushed to sell their government bonds. The franc plummeted on the foreign exchange market as bondholders scrambled to get their money out of the country. Inflation accelerated again, and tax revenues failed to keep pace with the rising cost of public-sector outlays, as in Germany in 1923. With the government now unable to market even short-term bills and reluctant to raise the rate of interest they offered for fear that this would validate expectations of inflation and worsen the budgetary situation, this left only the Bank of France as bond purchaser of last resort.

The central bank thus faced a dilemma. Parliament had placed a ceiling in 1920 on how many currency notes the bank could issue precisely in order to limit the recourse of governments to inflationary finance. Purchasing government bonds in substantial amounts might now cause those limits to be breached. In an extraordinary turn of events, the Bank of France chose to falsify its published statements, disguising the fact that it had breached the legal ceiling on note issuance. The deception was elegant in its simplicity: the excess was simply placed under the heading “various” (divers) on the two sides of the Bank’s balance sheet.

In fact, this violation had begun already the previous March, under the earlier Poincaré-led Center-Right government. Secretary General Albert Aupetit, Bank of France Governor Georges Robineau’s headstrong second in command, took the initiative in an effort to avoid torpedoing the Poincaré government’s stabilization program.15 To not finance the government’s transitional deficits would have precipitated a funding crisis, putting an abrupt end to Poincaré’s stabilization effort. For Aupetit, who saw Poincaré’s stabilization as the country’s best remaining hope and who was anxious to give it time to work, breaking the law was a lesser evil.

With the temporary success of Poincaré’s stabilization, the note circulation fell safely below the legal maximum. But Aupetit continued to falsify the bank’s weekly statement, understating the note issuance in an effort to convince speculators that the stabilization was a success. In October, as the stabilization lost traction following the change in government, the note issue then rose above the legal ceiling a second time, a fact that the central bank, under Aupetit’s leadership, once again hid from wider view.

At this point, Bank of France officials informed Prime Minister Herriot and his finance minister, Etienne Clémentel, of the troubling state of affairs. But they conveniently neglected to mention that the problem had first arisen under the Bloc national government, so as to impress upon Cartel leaders that their own budgetary policies were to blame. This may help to explain why Herriot, though now aware of the deception, hesitated to go public.

The longer the status quo persisted, the larger the gap became between the central bank’s published balance sheet and the actual monetary circulation. And the larger the discrepancy, the more difficult it was to hide. By early 1925 its existence was common knowledge among members of the finance committees of the Chamber and Senate.16 The situation created considerable tension within the Bank of France, to the point where François de Wendel, a leading member of the central bank’s governing board, threatened to resign over the matter.

De Wendel’s threat tipped the balance toward the faction that favored coming clean. When on April 9 the falsification of the bank’s balance sheet was finally revealed, Herriot placed the blame on the bank. He insisted that the actions of his government were no different from those of its predecessors, but no matter. He was forced to resign, following a vote of no confidence in the Senate.

Specialists will recognize here what economists refer to as “fiscal dominance.”17 When fiscal policy makers decide, in their wisdom, to run a budget deficit, and there is nothing the central bank can do about it, the central bank will then have no choice but to buy the government’s bonds and tolerate a higher rate of inflation than it would prefer, if it is otherwise impossible to finance the deficit and the alternative is default and financial chaos. In the French case, the central bank went so far as to disregard the law. There is a parallel with the provision in the statute of the European Central Bank prohibiting it from buying the newly issued bonds of governments. That provision is designed to protect the ECB from fiscal dominance and the European public from inflation. There is also a parallel in how the ECB felt compelled to parse, if not exactly disregard, the provision in 2012 when, in the face of a bond-market crisis, it announced its program of Outright Monetary Transactions to buy government bonds on the secondary market.18 Sometimes, even central bankers are forced to conclude, there are worse things than a bit of inflation. The problem in France was that the resulting inflation was more than a bit. It persisted for the better part of two years, as one prime minister after another—there were seven in all from June 1924 to July 1926—grappled with the unwillingness of the Left and Right to compromise over the budget. The Left would propose a special levy on capital, and the wealthy would shift their savings abroad. The Right would then propose new taxes on consumption, and workers would take to the streets.

The resulting inflation was ruinous for small savers, rentiers, and military pensioners, the members of society least able to protect themselves. July 1926 saw protests by more than twenty thousand former servicemen and their sympathizers outside the Chamber of Deputies. Blaming foreigners for manipulating the franc and fomenting the inflation, the mob vented its anger by attacking Paris-by-night buses, the preferred vehicle of American tourists. Wealthy French families, fearing social unrest, sent not just their savings but now also their families abroad.

At this point the inflation was seriously disruptive; in some circles it was seen as a threat to French democracy itself. The Left-dominated Chamber of Deputies, in desperation, agreed on July 22 to allow Poincaré to return at the head of a government of national union.

Notwithstanding his harsh policies toward Germany, Poincaré held a reputation for prudence and caution. He was “the man of stability,” having made his name by helping to organize the nation’s finances during World War I. He had engineered the temporarily successful 1924 stabilization, after all. By raising taxes prior to a parliamentary election, he put the nation’s finances before political gain and paid the price.

Poincaré was also a man of stability in that he was not closely identified with either the Right or the Left. In the Chamber of Deputies he was associated with the Moderates. The Bloc national may have been center-right, but Poincaré also had friends and allies among the Socialists, not least Léon Blum, the future premier. As the product of a middle-class family, he identified with the small savers least well positioned to protect themselves from the effects of inflation. Moderation was what the circumstances required. When it came to domestic policies, as opposed to his dealings with Germany, it was what Poincaré offered.

Poincaré was asked to form a union government combining his Center-Right constituency with elements of the Left. There was now a consensus that the politicization of fiscal policy had gone too far. Poincaré’s appointment and his formation of a national unity government acknowledged this fact. The politicians, evidently, had learned the hard way that budgetary solutions needed to be agreed by consensus, not forced on the Right by the Left, or vice versa.

Fostering that consensus was now Poincaré’s task. Procedures for monitoring incomes and collecting taxes were upgraded with the goal of raising revenues. There was some streamlining of the public administration, with the closure of local law courts and other administrative offices. Funds from the state tobacco monopoly were earmarked for servicing and retiring public debt. This confirmed that there would be no expropriation of the rich, something that the formation of a union government had already, in fact, made clear. Finally, Poincaré proposed to convert the short-term national defense bonds that had been the immediate source of financial vulnerability into stabler long-term obligations.

The desire to shift the burden of stabilization, whether from capital to labor, from the middle classes to the wealthy, or from France to Germany, had burned itself out in the fires of inflation. As a result, Poincaré’s limited measures sufficed to cement the 1926 stabilization, which took hold in August. Prices stopped rising; the exchange rate, having depreciated previously, now began to appreciate, to the discomfort of French exporters, who enjoyed their newfound competitive advantage, leading the Bank of France to buy foreign currencies in exchange for francs to slow the currency’s rise. The franc was then pegged to sterling and the dollar at the end of 1926, and gold convertibility was restored in 1928.

France’s gold standard statutes, like Germany’s, were rigid. They prohibited the central bank from purchasing government securities on the market (engaging in “open market operations”) and otherwise providing direct financing to the government. As in Germany, a long shadow was cast by the inflation and the social divisions it laid bare. Halting inflation, first in Germany and then in France, encouraged flight capital to return. Inflation having been subdued, there was more confidence that investments would hold their value. The commitment to return to the gold standard, in order to endure, required governments to balance their budgets. Investors thus had new reason to hope that the long succession of deficits and conflict over the incidence of taxes had finally come to an end. In time, this idea that stabilizing the currency somehow guaranteed responsible fiscal behavior and relieved investors of the risk of sovereign default would be revealed as mistaken. This was of course the same mistake committed by those who purchased the bonds of Southern European nations following the advent of the euro in 1999. It had the same consequences.

The influx of foreign money was a mixed blessing for the French and German economies, since it placed upward pressure on their currencies. To prevent the exchange rate from shooting through the roof, to the detriment of exporters, the Reichsbank and Bank of France bought up those foreign funds, in return for marks and francs. But the foreign securities, and sterling securities in particular, acquired in this way were not obviously as good as the gold for which they could be exchanged.

Hence Norman’s problem. In the second half of 1926 the Reichsbank began cashing in its sterling balances, taking gold from the Bank of England in return. In the six months ending in February 1927, British gold exports to Germany approached $60 million, a considerable sum. Schacht, now firmly installed as head of the German central bank, was conscious of the constructive role Norman played in the negotiation of the Dawes Plan, under which reparations were reduced and a stabilization loan was secured. But, any such gratitude notwithstanding, Schacht’s first responsibility was for his portfolio. His belief in the importance of following the gold standard rules was not tempered by emotion. Schacht therefore presented the sterling he acquired through his sterilization operations to the Bank of England for conversion into gold.

Norman had not been as helpful to the Bank of France when it was grappling ineffectually with debt and currency crises in 1923, 1925, and 1926. He saw France as having been particularly obstructionist in negotiating a reparations settlement. There was also the fact that the Bank of England and Bank of France were vying for influence in Central and Eastern Europe, whose financial business they sought to attract to London and Paris. Although Émile Moreau, successor to Robineau as governor of the Bank of France from 1926 to 1930, characterized his English counterpart as “aimable et charmant,” Norman had rebuffed France’s efforts to obtain concrete assistance for financial stabilization.19

Now, as capital flowed from Britain to France, the tables turned. The foreign assets acquired by the Bank of France were denominated in sterling and issued in London. Responding to the same uncertainties as the Reichsbank, Moreau took the first opportunity to cash them in. He was aware that his request, by draining gold from the Bank of England, would force Norman to raise “Bank rate,” the rate the Bank of England charged when discounting bills for other financial institutions. But this was not an undesirable side effect. If the result was tighter conditions in London, the source of a significant fraction of the short-term capital flooding into France, then the policy had corollary benefits from the French point of view. If it created difficulties for the Bank of England, then so be it.

Britain’s one source of leverage was the World War I debt that France owed Britain. Norman therefore suggested to Winston Churchill, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that he ask for its repayment to be accelerated. This threat, thinly veiled, led Moreau to negotiate a compromise in June 1927 in which the Bank of France limited its further conversion of sterling into gold to £30 million. Norman’s aggressive diplomacy solved, or at least put off, the immediate problem. But it did not enhance the prospects for friendly monetary relations going forward.

Strong monitored these Franco-British negotiations from his perch in New York. Excepting a hiatus in late 1926 spent in Biltmore, North Carolina, while recovering from pneumonia, he was in almost continuous contact with his friend Norman by cable and letter. Knowing that the opinions of the American central banker carried weight, Moreau forwarded Strong his own account of the Bank of France–Bank of England negotiations in an effort to ensure that Strong formed a balanced view.

The net effect was to impress on Strong the tenuousness of the British position. The continued stability of sterling hinged on the cooperation of the Reichsbank and the Bank of France, but this was not something to be taken for granted. At the same time, these sensible men understood that they were in it together. Strong had held friendly bilateral discussions with Norman, Schacht, and various Bank of France officials. In the case of Norman and Strong, there were more than just friendly bilateral discussions. The two men had met already during World War I on the occasion of Strong’s inaugural trip to Europe as governor of the New York Fed and formed a personal bond. They became pen pals and vacationed together twice a year for much of the 1920s, health permitting. If Norman had been able to develop such a fruitful relationship with Strong, why then couldn’t these other central bankers reach a similarly harmonious understanding in face-to-face meetings?

Norman therefore suggested that he and Strong meet together with Schacht and Moreau. Strong issued the invitation—he was still recovering from his bout of pneumonia, dictating that the meeting take place in the United States. Moreau, possessing no English, even then the universal language of central banking, passed the invitation to Charles Rist, his number two.

Strong, Norman, Schacht, and Rist assembled in the first week of July in Woodbury, on Long Island, at the home of US Treasury Undersecretary Ogden Mills. This monumental county seat, designed by John Russell Pope, was one of the most lavish on Long Island, with views in all directions and a central portion that “rises through two stories, with its cornice and parapet of somewhat Italian feeling . . . flanked and carefully held by the well-proportioned blocklike wings whose flat fretted cornices carry the line of the first story order around the entire building.”20

This was opulent architecture more than befitting a meeting of the world’s leading central bankers. Whether the international financial architecture was up to the task was another matter. For five days the central bankers conferred. It was like herding cats; Strong failed even to get all three of his colleagues into a room at the same time. Norman emphasized the delicacy of his position and his limited gold reserves. Schacht and Rist reiterated the importance of adhering to the rules of the gold standard as strictly as possible.

Process of elimination left one central bank to take the initiative. The result was another attempt by Strong to convince the Federal Reserve banks to agree to cut interest rates to support sterling. There was no little irony in the outcome. Strong had agreed to convene the meeting in an effort to encourage adjustments by the European bankers, but it was he who ended up doing the adjusting.

To make the case, Strong saw to it that Norman, Schacht, and Rist continued on to Washington and New York to meet with the board of governors and with Daniel Crissinger, chairman of the New York Fed. These officers of the Fed, evidently, were convinced. By the end of August, eight Reserve banks had voted to cut interest rates by half a point. Adolph Miller would have dissented, but he was summering in California. Later he criticized the decision as giving “a further great and dangerous impetus to an already overexpanded credit situation, notably to the volume of credit used on the stock exchanges.”21

The majority decision was then imposed on the dissenting Reserve banks, starting with the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. This was the first time in the history of the Federal Reserve System that the board of governors imposed its will on dissenting Reserve banks. Strong was pleased, no doubt, to see the board force the other Reserve banks into line. Higher rates in the Midwest than the East had allowed banks in the interior to borrow more cheaply in New York in order to lend to their own customers, resulting in a drain of reserves and gold from the New York Fed. This assertion of authority by the board was an important step toward an integrated Federal Reserve policy, in which decisions were not made by individual Reserve banks following their parochial concerns but instead coordinated across districts with the needs of the national economy in mind. Unfortunately, it was only a step. When the crunch came, in 1929, coordination would be lacking. And the consequences would not be pretty.
