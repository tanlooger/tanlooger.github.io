title: Chapter 5 Where Credit Is Due
---



Extraordinary financial events like the housing boom in the United States rarely have single causes. Among the causes of this one were incentive problems all along the mortgage origination-extension-securitization chain. Mortgage brokers, who were licensed not by the federal government but by the states if at all, had limited interest in the ability of aspiring purchasers to meet their obligations. Like the binder boys of the 1920s, they were in it for the commission. Mortgage lenders who earned closing costs and other fees when extending a loan were similarly inclined to disregard problems insofar as loans were securitized and sold on to other investors.

That declining lending standards accompanied the flow of credit into the housing market and its subprime segment in particular is indisputable. Neighborhoods with an unusually large share of subprime borrowers prior to the boom experienced the most rapid growth of mortgage debt between 2002 and 2005. Similarly, the increase in the share of mortgages that were securitized or sold to financial institutions unaffiliated with the originator was strongest in neighborhoods where there were already a large number of subprime mortgages at the start of the period. All this occurred despite the stagnant growth of income in the neighborhoods in question.1

The rating agencies that were the putative gatekeepers of the securitization process earned generous fees for advising lenders on how to structure CDOs so as to secure AAA ratings. As a result they hesitated to confer a low grade on a security to which they lent their imprimatur. Lenders could shop the prospectus around competing rating agencies and publish only the rating that placed their issue in the most favorable light.2 Much later, in 2013, the Justice Department filed a $5 billion civil suit against Standard & Poor’s for inflating its ratings on residential mortgage-backed securities and CDOs. Already at the beginning of 2007, the complaint alleged, the agency was aware that a deteriorating housing market was undermining the performance of residential mortgage-backed securities but hesitated to cut its ratings for fear of driving business to competing firms. The Justice Department cited an internal email by an S&P analyst parodying the Talking Heads song “Burning Down the House” as evidence that those farther down the corporate food chain understood full well what was happening.3 It described how, in response to an article in Fortune magazine questioning whether the rating agencies were behind the curve, S&P contemplated hiring a public-relations firm rather than reviewing its internal models.4

Investors should have known better than to rely on gatekeepers with such dubious incentives. But the complexity of the securities in question made it difficult to independently evaluate the risks. As in any boom period, the rising share of naïve investors in the market, including sleepy regional banks in Germany, made it even less likely that the rating agencies would be caught out.5

Or one might think that lenders would have been discouraged from engaging in questionable practices by the risk of damaging their reputation. But new entrants into the mortgage lending business, typically nonbank lenders regulated by state rather than federal authorities, had little reputation to preserve.6 The boom in subprime lending and securitization in the years leading up to 2007 thus suffered from the same “reputation deficit” as foreign lending in the 1920s. And even where there was franchise value to protect, management had other incentives. Angelo Mozilo was able to reap more than $400 million from selling shares in Countrywide Credit that were part of his compensation package.7

Brokers, meanwhile, were encouraged to steer borrowers toward loans carrying high interest rates by a structure known as the “yield spread premium.” This paid the broker a fraction of the gain to the lender from putting a borrower into a more expensive loan. This structure was most prevalent in the subprime segment of the market, where consumers were least well informed. A 2008 study by the Center for Responsible Lending concluded that a subprime borrower going through a broker paid $5,222 more in interest over the first four years of a loan on average than if he or she had borrowed from a bank or other financial institution directly.8

This is not to say that the banks were less culpable. Elizabeth Jacobson, who worked for Wells Fargo in Baltimore, described in an affidavit how loan officers in poor, predominantly black neighborhoods steered customers toward high-interest subprime mortgages even when the borrower qualified for a better rate.9 Customers were discouraged from providing income documents and down payments, so they would end up with a more expensive loan. Countrywide Credit, the industry leader and pioneer in automated underwriting, programmed its systems not to list subprime borrowers’ cash reserves, which resulted in their being steered away from lower-cost loans.10 Where Countrywide’s profit on conventional mortgages averaged 1–2 percent of the value of the loan, margins on subprime loans were said to approach 15 percent.11 Many of these more costly loans featured a low teaser rate for an introductory period, after which they reset, together with prohibitive prepayment penalties that made refinancing impossibly costly. If this implied a high likelihood of default, that was someone else’s problem, since the mortgage was part of a pool that was securitized, tranched, and transferred to other investors.

In 2009, closing the barn door after the horse had bolted, the Federal Reserve Board issued a regulatory decision prohibiting payments to mortgage brokers and loan officers that were based on the interest rate charged the borrower.12 In 2012 Wells Fargo settled a Justice Department suit alleging that it had overcharged thirty thousand minority buyers. It agreed to pay $125 million to compensate the borrowers and donate $50 million to a program assisting individuals in making down payments and improving their homes. No aspect of the crisis is more controversial than the role of the government-sponsored mortgage agencies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Fannie, formally the Federal National Mortgage Association, was created in 1938 to purchase mortgages from banks, freeing up resources to permit them to extend new loans. Freddie, formally the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, was established in 1970 to provide competition for Fannie and to work more closely with S&Ls, Fannie having worked with mortgage banks.13

In the early 1980s, at more or less the same time the S&L industry descended into crisis, the two government-sponsored entities expanded their operations. They installed Countrywide-style automated mortgage approval and purchase systems. They securitized mortgages, guaranteed the resulting instruments, and passed them on to other investors. They purchased mortgage-backed securities from other financial institutions, adding them to their portfolios of mortgage-related investments.

The fraction of all mortgages securitized by Fannie and Freddie or held on their balance sheets had remained stable over the course of the 1970s at roughly 10 percent. But in the 1980s, in response to these initiatives, that share took off like a rocket. When it leveled off in the mid-1990s, Fannie and Freddie accounted for nearly 40 percent of the mortgage market.

In and of itself, this growth is not proof of anything. The expansion of Fannie and Freddie’s mortgage-purchase and asset-securitization activities was concentrated in 1981–1994. In other words, it long preceded the housing bubble. But the two government-sponsored entities, or GSEs, were still there, their critics allege, blithely providing additional mortgage credit after the housing market lost its moorings in the late 1990s. Though the GSEs were formally private—Freddie was a private corporation from the start, while Fannie was converted in 1968 from a mixed-ownership corporation in which the federal government held shares to a fully private corporation—it was understood that the government stood behind them. If Fannie and Freddie ran into trouble, Congress could be expected to bail them out, since the two institutions were carrying out a public mission.

Because the government was there to lend a hand, Freddie and Fannie were permitted to hold less capital than conventional financial institutions. They were not required to register their debt securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This reinforced the perception of a government backstop, such treatment normally being associated with a public agency as opposed to a private corporation. The perception of a public backstop also allowed Fannie and Freddie to fund their activities more cheaply. This in turn made mortgage credit more freely available.

The Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, signed by President George H. W. Bush on the eve of a hotly contested election, then amended Fannie and Freddie’s charters to require them to “facilitate the financing of affordable housing.” Thirty percent of mortgages acquired or guaranteed by the GSEs were now to originate with individuals in neighborhoods with “low and moderate incomes.” In 1999, with another presidential term drawing to a close, the Clinton administration encouraged Fannie to ramp up its purchases of loans to lowand moderate-income homeowners in distressed inner-city districts. In 2000, just a week before the November election, the 30 percent guideline for lowto moderate-income mortgages was raised to 50 percent.

The government’s “affordable housing goals” dovetailed with the aspirations of Fannie’s ambitious new CEO, Franklin Delano Raines. Having grown up in modest means, in a home that his father built by hand, Raines graduated from Harvard College and then Harvard Law School and studied as a Rhodes Scholar. After working in both the Nixon and Carter White Houses (no mean feat, that) and at the Office of Management and Budget, Raines became a general partner of the investment firm Lazard Frères. As CEO of Fannie Mae, he was the first African American to head a Fortune 500 company. Anxious to make his mark, Raines set a goal of doubling Fannie’s earnings in five years. The main way he planned to accomplish this, given the razor-thin margins of the underwriting business, was by using cheap funding to finance expansion of Fannie’s mortgage portfolio.

From 1995 through 2003, the share of mortgages accounted for by Fannie and Freddie rose further, from just under 40 percent to 50 percent of the total outstanding. Enterprising companies like Countrywide set up dedicated subsidiaries with the express purpose of selling mortgages to the GSEs. By 2003, Fannie Mae was buying more than 70 percent of all the mortgages that Countrywide issued. When Wall Street then offered to purchase and securitize Countrywide’s nonconforming mortgages (subprime and other mortgages that did not meet the GSE’s underwriting standards), Fannie lowered its standards to avoid losing market share. Fannie and Freddie may have followed Wall Street rather than leading it, as Phil Angelides, chair of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, later put it.14 But their actions were no less important for the fact. The two government-sponsored entities, in this view, were key enablers of the mortgage boom.

Other evidence is less supportive of the indictment. Between 2003 and 2006, the share of mortgages purchased by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae fell back from 50 to 30 percent.15 In 2003, Freddie Mac revealed that it had misstated its earnings by nearly $5 billion. Similar accounting problems then came to light at Fannie Mae. The scandal forced Raines to resign in December 2004.16 In response to these scandals, regulators imposed tighter limits on the GSEs’ lending activities. The share of mortgages held in the form of the asset-backed securities of entities other than Fannie and Freddie then tripled in the three years from 2003, as other financial institutions stepped into the breach. In the late stages of the boom, it was not the GSEs but other financial institutions that were driving the process.

What was true of the market in general was true of its subprime segment in particular. The share of subprime and near-subprime (Alternative A or Alt-A) mortgages originated and securitized by financial institutions other than Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac quadrupled over the period. Between 2004 and 2006, Fannie and Freddie went from holding nearly half of subprime mortgages securitized and sold into the market to holding less than a quarter. At the height of the housing boom, in other words, a growing share of mortgage credit, in general and to the subprime segment in particular, was being drawn from other sources—that is, from hedge funds, investment banks, and foreign banks that loaded up on mortgage-linked CDOs.

If one wishes to blame Fannie and Freddie for the housing boom, then a more convoluted logic is required. It could be that the private sector, squeezed out of the conventional mortgage market by the GSEs, responded by moving into riskier mortgages. Alternatively, it might be argued that Fannie and Freddie’s portfolios had grown so large that their collapse would have destabilized the housing market and the economy, something that the George W. Bush administration, its free-market coloration notwithstanding, was anxious to avoid. The Fed, as the administration’s agent, could therefore be expected to do whatever it took to prevent a significant decline in housing prices. This encouraged investors, aware of the situation, to dive headfirst into the deep end of the mortgage securitization pool.

But if the idea was that the “Greenspan-Bernanke put” would place a floor under not just the stock market but also housing prices, then this expectation would prove dreadfully wrong. Perverse incentives to relax lending standards may have been ample, but the lending still had to be financed. Here is where Federal Reserve policy came into play.

The Fed’s contribution traces back to the end of the tech bubble in 2000 and Al Qaeda’s attack on the Twin Towers. Fearing that these shocks to confidence would mean a weak economy, the Federal Open Market Committee cut the federal funds rate (the rate at which banks lend reserves to one another, which the Fed uses as its interest rate target) from more than 6 percent to less than 2 percent.17

Moreover, with inflation already low, FOMC members worried that, if the economy weakened further, the United States might slip into a Japan-style deflation from which it would be impossible to escape. In June 2002, Federal Reserve Board staff published an analysis of how Japan had fallen prey to deflation, highlighting the Bank of Japan’s halfhearted policy response. Ben Bernanke, newly appointed to the board of governors, gave a widely cited speech on the dangers of deflation. In his incarnation as a professor at Princeton, Bernanke had authored a series of papers in which he criticized the Bank of Japan for not having done more to head off the problem.18 Citing the staff’s analysis, Bernanke now argued that “when inflation is already low and the fundamentals of the economy suddenly deteriorate, the central bank should act more preemptively and aggressively than usual in cutting rates.”19 He lobbied for preemptive action in the meetings of the FOMC, gaining the support of Chairman Greenspan, who cautioned the committee that it was dealing with a “latent deflationary type of economy.” This was a “pretty scary prospect,” Greenspan warned his colleagues, “and one that we certainly want to avoid.”20 But the Fed’s policy rate was already at a relatively low 2 percent. Responding “preemptively and aggressively,” as the Bernanke Doctrine dictated, therefore required cutting rates and keeping them at a rock-bottom level until the risk of deflation passed. Accordingly, the Fed funds rate was kept at a scant 1 percent on a monthly average basis until May 2004.

Eventually, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of such matters, determined that the trough of the business cycle had been reached ten quarters earlier, in November 2001.21 In fairness, one should note that the National Bureau’s Business Cycle Dating Committee waits for the arrival of definitive data before dating a business cycle peak or trough. This is in contrast to the FOMC, which makes policy in real time. With benefit of hindsight, we can say that the Fed overestimated the risk of deflation and responded too preemptively and aggressively. As a student of Japan and of the Great Depression, Bernanke may have been overly sensitive to the danger of deflation at this point in time. In other words, history may be useful for informing the views of policy makers of how to respond to certain risks, but it may also shape and inform outlooks in ways that heighten other risks (something that Federal Reserve historians, looking back at the central bank’s experience with the real bills doctrine in the 1930s, should have known perfectly well).

Distorted data may have also contributed to the Fed’s exaggerated concern with deflation. Contemporaneous data showed the personal consumer expenditure deflator, cleansed of volatile food and fuel prices, falling to less than 1 percent in 2003, dangerously close to negative territory. Subsequent revisions revealed that inflation in fact had already bottomed out at 1.5 percent and was now safely on the rise.22 As it happened, the real danger of deflation would develop later, in 2009 after the housing bubble burst. At this point, it can be argued, Bernanke’s heightened aversion to deflation came in handy. By the second half of 2004, fears of deflation had subsided. The FOMC moved to normalize the policy rate. But how quickly it could move was limited by the wish to avoid choking off the recovery. 2004 was yet another presidential election year. Raising rates at a pace that posed even a mild threat to recovery might be seen, justifiably or not, as influencing political outcomes.

Consequently, through 2004 and into 2005 interest rates remained significantly below the level normally targeted by the Fed. Specifically, they remained below the level pointed to by the Taylor Rule, so called for having been developed by Stanford University economist John Taylor. Taylor’s rule of thumb captured the historical relationship between the Fed’s policy target, the federal funds rate, on the one hand and inflation and the shortfall of output from potential on the other. This rule of thumb for what had worked reasonably well in the past quickly became a guidepost for appropriate policy going forward. By Taylor’s reckoning, the federal funds rate was as much as three full percentage points below normal in early 2004, and it took the Fed more than two additional years to eliminate the discrepancy.23

Unlike 1925–1927, another period when US interest rates were unusually low, the motivation this time was domestic rather than international. It was to avoid deflation, not to help other countries with their balance-of-payments problems. But if the motivation differed, the financial implications were the same. Faced with low yields on treasury bills and other short-term investments, investors stretched for yield. They purchased longer-term securities, not just treasury bonds but also instruments backed by residential mortgages, pushing down long-term rates—including mortgage rates. The interest-rate sensitivity of housing prices and new home starts is notorious; hence the argument, popular after the fact, that the Fed bore heavy responsibility for the construction boom and housing bubble.24

The architects of the policy were convinced that they had fended off a catastrophic deflation while contributing only marginally to housing market excesses. Analysis by Federal Reserve staff suggested that low interest rates had a limited impact on the housing market. More important were what central bank researchers called “housing-specific shocks,” code for movements in house prices that were not otherwise explicable.25 It appeared that households were committing to long-term obligations in the form of thirty-year mortgages, and that investors were committing to risky investments in the form of mortgage-backed securities, to a greater extent than could be explained by the historical behavior of interest rates, growth rates, and inflation rates alone.

The explanation, officials like Donald Kohn, Fed vice chairman under Bernanke, concluded after the fact, was not so much that interest rates were lower as that the economy had become stabler, incomes more predictable.26 The fact, or at least the belief, that output and employment had become less volatile encouraged risk taking. Thinking their incomes were now stabler, households became more comfortable with assuming debt. Investors became more comfortable with stretching for yield. The parallels with the 1920s, when it was similarly thought that the business cycle had been tamed, would have been clear to see, had anyone been inclined to look.

Statisticians date the Great Moderation, as this diminution in the volatility of business cycle fluctuations was known, to the late 1980s. That the shift followed the adoption of a new operating framework at the Fed, which made the pursuit of low and stable inflation a priority, encouraged the belief that improvements in the conduct of monetary policy were responsible for the increase in stability. Again, the parallels with the false stability of the 1920s and the availability of innovations in central banking to explain it are apparent.

Whether changes in Federal Reserve operating procedures were, in fact, mainly responsible for the Great Moderation continues to be debated. One view is that they were, but another is that the decline in the amplitude of the business cycle owed more to good luck—to the absence of oil shocks in particular.27 Once the Great Moderation came to be seen as part of the problem, policy makers were happy to deny all credit. But even if low long-term rates were part of the problem, those rates were lower than could be explained by Federal Reserve policy alone. This was the bond-market “conundrum” of which Chairman Greenspan spoke in his February 2005 testimony to Congress and to which he returned repeatedly thereafter. Ten-year treasury yields had shown no tendency to rise from mid-2004 through mid-2005 despite the fact that the Fed was raising short-term rates. To the contrary, the rate on ten-year treasuries actually fell, from 4.7 to 4.0 percent.28 And the interest rate on conventional mortgages fell with it.29

The explanation, Greenspan argued, lay in the “tectonic shift” in China and other parts of the developing world from central planning to market-led growth.30 These fast-growing economies were high-savings economies, since workers now had higher incomes out of which to save. In China’s case, this was not the only source of the problem (insofar as an excess of thrift can be said to constitute a problem). In addition, state-owned enterprises contributed to high domestic savings by hoarding their earnings. Those enterprises benefited from privileged access to domestic markets. Officials applied little pressure for them to distribute their profits or to transfer them to the general government budget. Management was mainly interested in empire building, which it could pursue by reinvesting earnings. Combine the quarter of Chinese national income saved by households with the quarter retained by firms, and China was saving and investing, at the peak in 2006, an extraordinary 50 percent of GDP.

Sensibly investing this embarrassment of riches was not easy. Other countries experiencing “economic miracles,” like Thailand and South Korea, had sought to do so but learned a painful lesson in the dangers of unproductive investment. Their mid-1990s booms, underwritten by banks that financed the questionable investment projects of commercial property developers and corporate conglomerates, had come crashing down in the Asian financial crisis of 1997–98. The lesson drawn was that it is safer to invest moderately and concentrate on high-quality projects. If doing so meant slower growth, then this was a price worth paying, especially if it meant not having to crawl for help to the International Monetary Fund.

But investing less required finding other outlets for Asia’s abundant savings. One conceivable outlet was the government bond market, but there were few government bonds in Asia itself. Asian governments ran surpluses rather than deficits. The limited supply of bonds was snapped up by pension funds and insurance companies, which held them to maturity, rendering such Asian bond markets as existed relatively illiquid.

The opposite was true, of course, of the United States. The US treasury bond market was the single largest and most liquid financial market in the world. The federal government was pumping out treasuries to finance the deficits that flowed from the 2001 recession, the Bush tax cuts, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. And if this was not enough to meet demand, there were always the high-yielding securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Thus, Asian countries piled into US treasury bonds and into the securities of Fannie and Freddie. Insofar as purchasing US debt securities pushed the dollar up and local currencies down, this kept the Asian export machine humming. For China in particular, the practice helped sustain the export industries that were the engine of growth.31

Estimates of the impact on long-term interest rates of this “global savings glut,” as Governor Bernanke dubbed it, ranged as high as two full percentage points.32 And two percentage points on long-term rates were more than enough to exert a first-order impact on the housing market. This was Greenspan and Bernanke’s defense. China, not they, had unleashed the tsunami of credit flowing into the housing market. With China and other emerging markets investing less than they saved, someone else had to invest more. In the event, that someone else was the United States, where the additional investment took the form of residential construction.

The Fed might have attempted to offset these effects by raising rates, but the sustainability of the recovery was uncertain. In 2003, when US central bankers and others began drawing attention to the impact of Chinese treasury bond purchases, GDP growth was running below 3 percent, considerably slower than is typical of recovery from an economic downturn. Against this backdrop, strong construction activity was welcome. Although the run-up in housing prices posed risks, monetary policy was a blunt instrument with which to address them, especially if doing so threatened to add to unemployment and heightened the risk of deflation. Memories of the last time the Fed had used interest rates to deflate an asset bubble, in 1929, served as a cautionary tale.

Above all, there was a reluctance, deeply grounded in ideology, to second-guess the markets. To the contrary, it could be argued that this was a happy outcome all around. Drawing on ample foreign savings, the United States could finance its budget deficits and construction activity more cheaply. Its low domestic savings were less of a constraint on government spending and home building alike. If US households were ramping up their spending, this reflected the prospective acceleration in productivity growth, it was suggested, and the higher future incomes promised by the country’s singular facility in applying new information technologies. All this was disturbingly reminiscent of the 1920s, when it was argued that electrification and the assembly line augured a permanent acceleration in productivity and income growth, but no matter. China, for its part, could export its way to a higher level of output and keep its savings in liquid form. The United States imported Chinese manufactures and exported safe and liquid assets, while China did the reverse. This was the best of all worlds.

A few observers raised questions about the sustainability of the process. There were limits to how much Beijing would lend, they warned, to enable the United States to purchase Chinese goods. Sooner or later, China would want to translate its prowess at production into more consumption, at which point the flow of finance into US markets would dry up.

But there was no agreement on when. Those of skeptical temperament observed that the United States had limited capacity to pump out safe assets; pump out too many and they would no longer be safe, leading China to pull the plug. This gave grounds for worrying about what would happen when, as Chuck Prince, in his days as chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, put it, the music stopped.

Unfortunately, almost everyone making the connection between Chinese saving and US interest rates focused on what would happen if China’s willingness to finance US current account deficits evaporated abruptly, much as US willingness to finance German deficits had evaporated in 1928. US interest rates would shoot up. Cheap foreign finance no longer being available, the US current account deficit would have to be eliminated at a stroke. The dollar, no longer receiving foreign support, would collapse on the foreign exchange market.

We know from subsequent events that the critics were right to worry. But they were wrong to focus on risks to exchange rates and the balance of payments. It was in housing and securitization, and not the foreign-exchange market, that the critical imbalances built up. Unfortunately, few of those who raised questions about sustainability focused their attention there.
