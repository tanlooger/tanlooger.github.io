title: Chapter 17 Takahashi’s Revenge
---



The great depression was a crisis not just for the United States but for the world. It was the most serious global crisis in memory. For most countries it was the most serious crisis since World War I.

One might think that a crisis of this magnitude would have shocked governments and central banks into action. But officials hesitated to resort to the kind of exceptional measures to which they had turned in wartime. Balanced budgets remained the order of the day, or the aspiration of balanced budgets anyway, since achievement of the same remained elusive. This was very different from the response in 1914, when orthodoxy quickly gave way in the fight for national survival.

Likewise, the gold standard may have collapsed, but central banks and their political masters were reluctant to capitalize on their newfound freedom. Instead they sought to surrender it as quickly as possible by re-pegging the national currency, if no longer to gold then to sterling or the dollar. The instincts that led FDR to re-peg the dollar to gold at $35 an ounce already in January 1934 and to do what he could to restrain the growth of government spending were by no means uniquely Rooseveltian, or for that matter uniquely American.

The specifics were shaped, to be sure, by distinctive aspects of each country’s experience. That said, it is possible to identify some common factors affecting the policy response, or lack of response, virtually everywhere. There was belief in the analogy between the household budget and the government budget. Governments should live within their means, and any tendency to do otherwise could only come to grief. Keynesian theories of countercyclical fiscal policy had not yet been developed, for better or worse. (Opinions 分页。。。differ.) Historians of economic thought like to point to contemporaries like Bertil Ohlin in Sweden and Paul Reynaud in France, who were able to intuit the argument for deficit spending in a slump. But even if recovering early proto-Keynesian arguments from contemporary writings is popular sport, it is hard to maintain that such arguments had much of an impact. What mattered more were the imperatives of rearmament, which led governments to increase spending and tolerate deficits as a matter of national survival, as they had in World War I. The bulk of that deficit-financed military spending occurred later, in the second half of the 1930s, by which time the crisis was long in the tooth.

In addition, there was the association of budget deficits and central bank credit creation with inflation, first during World War I and then in the 1920s.1 In countries like Germany, the public was traumatized by inflation. With that history still vivid, officials were reluctant to contemplate anything that might be seen as courting a recurrence of the experience, however remote and however radically circumstances were now changed. What is more remarkable is how those same fears of inflation, brought alive by this history, informed and inhibited policy in other countries, like the UK, that had experienced the phenomenon only at second hand.

Associated with these fears was an all-but-universal reluctance to abandon the exchange rate as the anchor for monetary policy. The exchange rate against gold had been the basis for central bank decision making for years. The one peacetime exception, the first half of the 1920s, was a disaster of inflation and financial instability. The gold standard had malfunctioned, but there was no coherent alternative for conducting monetary policy. Much later, in the 1990s, central banks developed the conceptual framework known as “flexible inflation targeting.”2 When the crisis hit in 2007–08, they were willing to let their currencies move, if such movement was a corollary of monetary policies directed at stabilizing prices and output. But in the 1930s, the absence of a coherent alternative to the traditional exchange-rate-centered approach to monetary policy left central banks reluctant to abandon it. This in turn limited their ability to stabilize not just prices but also the economy and its financial system.

This reluctance allowed the Depression to deepen and persist. That depth and persistence in turn did much to discredit prevailing economic and financial arrangements. In some cases, as in the United States, this prompted efforts to repair and rehabilitate the market system. It led to regulatory reforms designed to stabilize financial markets, institutional reforms to strengthen the conduct of monetary policy, and social policy reforms to protect those unable to protect themselves. In other cases, as with Germany, the Depression and the failure of policy makers to address it led to less constructive outcomes. The market system was rejected in favor of state direction. This alternative to fixing the broken market economy, it would transpire, was far worse. The exception that proves the rule, demonstrating what was possible when a government took concerted action, was Japan. The country had already endured a difficult decade, growing at less than 1 percent per annum between 1919 and 1929. Activity was disrupted by bank runs and financial panics. Failure of the Osaka-based Masuda Bill Broker Bank in April 1920 provoked runs across the country. In February 1922 the failure of Ishii Corporation, a lumber company speculating in commodities, sparked runs in Osaka, Kyoto, and Kochi Prefecture on banks thought to have ties to Ishii and one another. The Kanto Earthquake of 1923 wrought financial as well as physical damage, destroying the offices of fully 80 percent of all banks in Tokyo, leading to fears of more bank runs, and prompting a moratorium on debt payments. The government encouraged the Bank of Japan to discount commercial paper and other obligations payable in the affected areas and adopted an emergency ordinance promising to indemnify the bank, not unlike how the US Treasury in 2008 offered to indemnify the Fed for any losses it incurred as a result of its rescue of Bear Stearns.3 There was then a further round of runs in 1927, when in the course of the debate in the Diet over the terms of that compensation officials revealed the existence of financial problems in Suzuki & Co., a large trading house in Kobe, and its financial partner, the Bank of Taiwan.4

This litany of woes and the need for central bank intervention on each occasion resulted in delays in returning to gold.5 Japan finally did so in January 1930, in an act of exquisitely bad timing. The consequences were not unlike those in Britain, only worse. As in Britain, prices had risen sharply during the war. But in Japan, it was not possible to push them back down as rapidly as in Britain in the 1920s. Instead the Bank of Japan was forced to provide credit to keep the banks on life support. Thus, it could not restore the prewar exchange rate against sterling and gold.

Once conditions finally normalized sufficiently for the prewar exchange rate against sterling to be restored in 1930, the yen was significantly overvalued. This made for trade deficits and gold losses. It fed expectations that, when Britain abandoned the gold standard in September 1931, Japan would necessarily follow.

The Minseitō Party campaigned during the 1928 national election on a platform to cut wasteful public spending and restore the gold standard. The prime minister from 1929, Osachi Hamaguchi, appointed Junnosuke Inoue as his finance minister because he thought that Inoue, a fellow believer in gold standard orthodoxy, could successfully execute the policy. The austere, upright Inoue having done so successfully, he had much invested in the policy status quo. Following Britain’s departure from gold, he quickly reaffirmed that the monetary standard would be defended. The Bank of Japan raised the discount rate in October and again in November in an effort to carry out his wishes.6

The Federal Reserve had responded similarly to the reserve losses precipitated by Britain’s departure from gold.7 But where America’s gold peg held, Japan’s did not. Japan had a greater recent record of financial instability. Worried about the state of the banking system and doubtful about the capacity of the central bank to continue draining liquidity from financial markets, National City Bank, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC), Sumitomo, Mitsui, and Mitsubishi sold yen for dollars. Gold outflows continued unabated.8 Unable to agree on steps to contain them, the Minseitō-led government was forced to resign on December 12.

This brought to power the opposition Seiyūkai Party, and specifically Finance Minister Korekiyo Takahashi. The elderly Takahashi was an unlikely revolutionary. The illegitimate son of a court painter at Edo Castle, he was born in 1854, a year after the arrival of Commodore Perry’s black ships, and as an infant was adopted into the lowest rank of samurai. As a young man he served as an entry-level bureaucrat, first in the Ministry of Education and then in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, before going to work for the Bank of Japan. For having helped to arrange the foreign loans that financed the country’s war against Russia, he was awarded a peerage in 1905. In 1913, not yet forty, he was appointed finance minister. By 1931 he was on his fifth tour of the position. This obviously was no financial neophyte.

Takahashi held the further advantage that by 1931 Japan had formulated its monetary policy without support from the gold standard for more than a decade. Making monetary policy without that familiar structure was thus not something with which he or the Japanese public was unfamiliar. The decision to return to gold in 1930 having been taken by his predecessor, a member of the opposition party, Takahashi could reverse it without embarrassment.9 In addition, there was a sense of rivalry between Inoue and Takahashi. Inoue was an exponent of not just the gold standard but also fiscal austerity; his rival Takahashi was happy to position himself as the opposite.

This decision to follow Britain off gold was not unlike the response of a number of other countries, as we will see below. What was unique was Takahashi’s concerted use of policy to jump-start the economy. Immediately on embargoing gold exports, he moved to push down the exchange rate in order to vanquish expectations of deflation and strengthen export competitiveness. In March 1932 he proposed that the Bank of Japan directly purchase all newly issued government bonds, expanding the money supply. This was actually more than a proposal, since the Bank of Japan was not independent but, in fact, under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, Article 16 of the Bank of Japan Act providing a legal basis for the finance minister to instruct the central bank to engage in transactions in government bonds. There was little resistance within the bank; to the contrary, Takahashi received intellectual and political support from the deputy governor, Eigo Fukai, a fellow English speaker and friend.10 Other members of the bank’s administrative hierarchy were more skeptical but, the central bank not having exactly covered itself in glory, were in no position to object.11

In June Takahashi then submitted a supplementary budget providing for new spending on rural relief and on the army’s military operations in Manchuria, where renegade officers, protecting Japan’s colonial holdings there, had staged a terrorist incident they blamed on Chinese bandits, allowing them to launch a police action. Takahashi himself was opposed to Japan’s military intervention in Manchuria, but he could still use it to advance his economic strategy.12

All this, Takahashi now proposed, should be financed by bond issuance. Remaining limits on the ability of the Bank of Japan to purchase those bonds were then removed by a law raising the amount of unbacked currency the bank could issue from ¥120 million to ¥1 billion, and by a second measure placing controls on capital outflows. The expectation, clear in light of Takahashi’s actions and statements, was that the Bank of Japan would do its part to help finance his deficits. The government and central bank would be working in harness to actively bring deflation and depression to an end.

This, then, was an aggressively reflationary monetary policy made credible by fiscal expansion. In other words, it was precisely the policy claimed, erroneously, to have been followed in the United States under FDR.13 But in Japan, unlike the United States, the fiscal expansion was real.

Here at least is one case where economic analysis may have played a role. Takahashi had firsthand knowledge of Western economic literature, having gained fluency in English at the age of eleven, when he was sent to the treaty port of Yokohama to study with American missionaries. (Takahashi was selected for foreign-language studies by a progressive samurai who understood that Japan, to survive, would need to import military technology, notably from the United States and Britain, and that language skills would be needed for the next generation to achieve these ends.14) Takahashi was familiar with the Tract on Monetary Reform, the 1923 book in which Keynes emphasized the distinction between exchange rate stability and price stability and the need to prioritize the latter. He was up to date on subsequent intellectual developments, being an avid reader of the Times of London.15

The results of his initiative were dramatic. Rates on short-term money fell from 15 to 1 percent. The money supply stabilized in 1932 before rising sharply in 1933. In the year from December 1931, the yen depreciated by more than 40 percent against the pound sterling and 60 percent against the dollar. Wholesale prices rose by 7 percent in 1932 and 12 percent in 1933, while industrial production rose even faster. Real GDP grew by 7 percent in 1932 and 8 percent in 1933.16

This was a happy outcome for the economy, if not also for Takahashi. When Japan returned to full employment in 1935, he cut back on defense spending—resulting in his assassination by disaffected military officers. Japan’s experience thus illustrates what concerted monetary expansion, backed by fiscal stimulus, could do. But it is hard to find other similar examples. More typical was the response of the Bank of England. The bank’s hand had been forced, as we saw in Chapter 10, by the run on sterling that led to the suspension of convertibility in Montagu Norman’s absence. But even then, it was far from clear what would come next. The pound fell to $3.40 in the first week of floating, losing a quarter of its value. After a brief recovery, it then fell further to $3.23 at the beginning of December.

At this point Norman grew worried that any further decline would fatally undermine confidence. He also had to address the concerns of other governors and directors who had stepped into policy roles in his absence. Since assuming the governorship in 1920, Norman had turned the Bank of England virtually into a personal fiefdom. But his incapacity over the summer and absence at the time of the country’s most critical financial juncture transformed internal decision-making processes. Committees were set up in his absence; advisors were consulted. Following his return, they continued to meet and to advise. Decisions now were taken collectively, in response to collective hopes and fears.

Specifically, there was the collective fear that if panicked sales of the currency followed, Britain would succumb to the kind of inflation that had infected France and Germany in the 1920s. That inflation was the fear at a time when unemployment was 22 percent—when deflation was the real and present danger—can only be understood in light of collective psychology informed by this recent Continental experience.

Concerned that sterling was on the brink, Norman and his colleagues kept the bank’s policy rate at 6 percent through the end of the year and into 1932. The idea that sterling was poised to collapse was far-fetched, of course. The currency still had faithful followers in the banks and governments of the Commonwealth and Empire, and in other countries with extensive trade relations with Britain. But there was no more powerful conservative impulse than fear of the unknown, the gold standard having been the touchstone of policy for more than a century.

Norman, predictably, made no bones of his desire to return, albeit at a lower parity than before. Even Keynes, famously a critic of Churchill’s decision to return to gold in 1925, now encouraged the government to pursue an international agreement to restore gold convertibility and fixed exchange rates, albeit with the higher gold price and lower backing ratios needed for price stability. But agreement on a gold peg remained elusive.17

This context makes the cautious reorientation of policy easier to understand. Time was needed for old fears to subside. Only on February 18, nearly five months following the suspension of convertibility, did the Bank of England finally cut interest rates, from 6 to 5 percent. No exchange rate collapse or inflationary outburst materializing, it cut rates to 4 and then 3.5 percent in March, and finally to 2 percent in July. This, then, was the advent of Britain’s policy of “cheap money,” ten long months after the collapse of the old regime.

In fact, the important policy innovations, as in Japan, were undertaken not by the ever-conservative central bank but by the Treasury. Neville Chamberlain, son of Joseph Chamberlain (the father having been mayor of Birmingham, a member of Parliament, and, in his time, the country’s leading protectionist politician), was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer as a result of the October 1931 general election, which saw decisive rejection of the failed Labour government and election of a Conservative-dominated parliament. Eventually, Chamberlain’s name would become synonymous with appeasement. But if as prime minister and geopolitical strategist he was a disaster, he was a singularly effective chancellor by the standards of the time.

Effective by the standards of the time meant balancing the budget, as Chamberlain energetically set out to do with backing from his Conservative majority.18 His biographer, William Rock, captures well the prevailing ethos: “There was no relief from taxes; that might lead to a premature relaxation of the efforts which were beginning to produce a revival of public confidence. Drastic economies were necessary before the normal expenditures and revenue could be balanced; therefore, drastic economies there would be.”19 The resemblance with the policies of the David Cameron–led Conservative-Liberal government starting in 2010 was more than superficial.

Equally consequential was Chamberlain’s decision to set up an Exchange Equalisation Account (EEA) in the Treasury. The stated purpose of the account was to smooth fluctuations in the value of sterling by intervening in the foreign exchange market. In practice, however, the bulk of that intervention took the form of purchasing foreign exchange with sterling in order to keep the currency from rising. As Susan Howson, the unofficial historian of the EEA, judiciously put it, “It is clear that the authorities wished to reduce fluctuations in the exchange value of the pound, particularly upward fluctuations.”20

Using the EEA, Chamberlain kept sterling at a competitive level and ensured an adequate supply of domestic credit. Although he consulted with the Bank of England, it was the chancellor who made the final decision on the stance of policy. This was another example, in the manner of Takahashi, where a political leader seized the reins from a central bank that hesitated to act. Yet another instance of the same, as we have seen, was in October 1933, when FDR intervened in the gold market to push prices up and the dollar down.

As in the United States, and in contrast to Japan, however, there were no large-scale budget deficits accompanying this monetary expansion and no pressure on the central bank to buy the bonds issued to finance them. Moreover, a central bank discount rate of 2 percent, which was what Britain now enjoyed, was not cheap money by the standards of Mervyn King or Ben Bernanke. Supplies of money and credit increased only as permitted by inflows of foreign currency, which were then absorbed by the EEA in exchange for sterling. These could be fickle: inflows grew large in December 1932, when worries developed about a possible dollar devaluation by the US president-elect, but they could be small and even negative at other times. The British money supply, broadly defined, grew by 10 percent in 1932 but then stagnated in 1933.21 There was no attempt to push sterling down or to expand the money supply more aggressively. Once FDR completed his gold-buying program, the sterling rate against the dollar essentially returned to its early-1931 level, where it was stabilized.

If this was weak soup by the standards of Japan, the policy was better than nothing. A higher domestic currency price of gold meant a higher price level. Wholesale prices stopped falling in the summer of 1932, coincident with the reorientation of policy. Industrial production bottomed out in the third quarter and started rising in the fourth. The subsequent recovery was driven by interest-rate-sensitive spending, notably housing starts, motor vehicle sales, and, beginning in 1934, industrial investment. Cutting interest rates and preventing further falls in the price level also reduced the cost of servicing the heavy public debts inherited from World War I. Britain was able to maintain debt sustainability without having to endure even more severe public spending cuts.22 This was not vigorous recovery à la Japan, but it was recovery after a fashion. Members of the Commonwealth and Empire and other countries trading heavily with Britain were uncertain how to proceed. With their partner now off the gold standard, the advantages of adherence to that system were clearly diminished. There was an incentive to allow the currency to depreciate along with sterling in order to limit the loss of competitiveness in the British market. But rather than follow Takahashi in taking aggressive action, they followed Chamberlain, re-pegging to the pound, generally at levels not too different from those prevailing before 1931. In effect, it was the chancellor and the technicians at the Bank of England implementing his policy who determined the price level of the members of the sterling area.

The extent to which the subsequent policies remained exchange-ratecentered is striking.23 Sweden is regularly held up as one country that developed a coherent alternative in the form of price level targeting. The Riksbank, the country’s central bank, set an explicit target for the price level, it is said, and adjusted policy accordingly. Swedish policy was informed by economists like Gustav Cassel and Eli Heckscher, who were skeptical of the efficacy of the gold standard. The country had a long intellectual tradition, pioneered by the great Swedish economist Knut Wicksell, of prioritizing the stability of the price level as the proper aim of central bank policy.24 And, critically, Sweden had the advantage of not having endured a disruptive Germanor French-style inflation, allowing officials to contemplate alternatives.

There was much rhetoric about the desirability of stabilizing the price level. The Banking Committee of the Swedish parliament, or Riksdag, which supervised the central bank, formed a committee to consider alternatives. It warned against the precipitous resumption of gold convertibility and urged avoiding both deflation and inflation. Riksbank researchers constructed a new index of consumer prices to enable the central bank to better monitor price level trends.

But, new index of consumer prices or not, the board of the Riksbank remained preoccupied by the stability of the exchange rate, this still being regarded as the most reliable indicator of inflationary or deflationary tendencies. When the krona then showed signs of strengthening excessively in the spring of 1933, it was pegged to the pound at a level that remained unchanged until the outbreak of World War II. Having depreciated sharply in the Kreuger crisis of 1932, the currency was now competitively valued.25 But that valuation was more an inadvertent consequence of the crisis than a conscious monetary strategy. So much, then, for price-level targeting as an alternative to exchange-rate-centered policies.26

The story in Latin America was again similar. Since the United States rather than the UK was the most important trading partner of many Central and South American countries, they pegged their currencies to the dollar.27 Their governments having borrowed heavily abroad, currency adjustment was delayed until something was first done about the debt; otherwise, depreciating the currency would have made external obligations denominated in dollars impossible to service. Exchange controls were imposed to limit imports. One Latin American country after another then suspended debt service payments, after which devaluation of the currency could follow. Although antagonizing the creditors by halting interest payments was not ideal, foreign lending had already collapsed; there were worse fates now than having one’s bonds de-listed in New York and London. With the collapse of foreign trade, there was similarly less fear of trade retaliation.28

Having been cut loose from gold, the currency and balance of payments were now supported by imposing tariffs on imports of manufactured goods. Latin American countries had not seen much in the way of industrial development prior to this period.29 This now began to change as currency depreciation and tariff protection caused households and firms to substitute the products of domestic manufacturing firms for imported manufactured goods.30 There were also other less salutary government interventions, like those of the Coffee Stabilization Council in Brazil, which purchased fourteen million bags of coffee, only to burn them and dump them at sea in a futile attempt to support the world market price. Still this was nothing remotely approaching the extent of intervention in Germany and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe soon to come within its orbit. Germany, Austria, and Hungary, as victims of 1920s hyperinflation, were supremely reluctant to contemplate anything that might be construed as monetary manipulation. Even after the 1931 financial crisis, they continued to maintain the pretense, if not the reality, of the gold standard. Rather than allowing their currencies to move, they applied exchange controls to limit capital flight. Hungary was first to do so, in July 1931, when it was infected by the banking crisis in its old imperial partner, Austria. Within months Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia all followed.

An advantage of exchange restrictions for authoritarian governments was that they provided an additional lever with which to control the economy. By controlling the allocation of foreign exchange, they could determine the source and composition of imports. Exchange control was thus a step toward market socialism and, ultimately, central planning. It was an instrument of foreign policy that governments, notably Germany’s, deployed by demanding concessions and negotiating bilateral agreements with trading partners over which they had economic leverage.

Germany, as it did in other contexts, took these destructive tendencies to the extreme. Hitler himself was not especially knowledgeable of economic matters. On being appointed chancellor by President Paul von Hindenburg in January 1933, he turned for guidance and advice to Hjalmar Schacht, the Magician who had supposedly conjured up the 1924 stabilization. As power hungry as ever, Schacht not so secretly cultivated the chancellor-to-be and encouraged a reluctant Hindenburg to appoint him following the Nazis’ strong showing in the 1932 election. Thus, among Hitler’s first acts was to reappoint Schacht to the presidency of the Reichsbank, replacing Hans Luther.

Power hungry or not, for more than six months Schacht made essentially no use of his monetary powers to reflate the economy. With memories of hyperinflation omnipresent, he allowed the money supply to keep falling for the balance of 1933.31

But in the absence of monetary reflation, it was necessary to resort to less savory methods to stabilize the economy. Strikes were banned and union officials were arrested as the Nazis sought to boost employment by keeping wages low. Prices were controlled, and a price commissioner was appointed to monitor them. The Nazis established marketing boards with the exclusive right to purchase agricultural goods, first to support farm prices and then to keep them down as the economy recovered. They signed long-term contracts with industrial groups to purchase their output at fixed prices, using the threat of nationalization to secure favorable terms. From there it was a small step to establishing the Hermann Göring Works and other government-owned enterprises.

Understanding where the real power lay, Schacht moved in 1934 to the Ministry of Economics while also retaining his central bank presidency. There he enjoyed the kind of decree powers of which central bankers can only dream. Starting in September, when he announced his “New Plan” for overseeing all foreign exchange purchases and sales, with the exchange rate for trade depending on the country, there was a sharp shift in the composition of imports from consumer goods to the materials needed for rearmament. From this point, Schacht’s control of the country’s international transactions was complete.

However unsavory the means, the government’s ends were achieved. Output rose by 25 percent between 1933 and 1935, rescaling the peak reached in 1928. All this was done in the interest of rearmament, and only incidentally recovery, but no matter. Growth was led by capital spending on the military-industrial complex (steel, chemicals, aircraft, and motor vehicles). “Hitler had found a cure against unemployment before Keynes was finished explaining it,” was the way the Cambridge economist Joan Robinson put it.32

This was an exaggeration. The budget deficit of the Reich rose from essentially zero in 1932 to 3 percent of GDP in 1934, where it remained until 1937. This was a significant fiscal stimulus by the standards of the time, but it was too small to restore full employment in an economy with an unemployment rate above 20 percent and in which output had fallen more than 25 percent below potential.33 The association between budget deficits and inflation was still too vivid for even Hitler to engage in aggressive fiscal expansion.

And it is not as if whatever employment was created stimulated consumer spending. Wages were controlled. The availability of consumer goods was limited. Farmers were prohibited from borrowing to finance modernization and obtain working capital. “Guns, not butter,” the well-known slogan, was in fact coined by the Nazi propaganda ministry in 1935 to impress on the German public the priorities. Hitler could point to the restoration of full employment, but the main mechanisms by which this was achieved were the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935; transformation of the voluntary labor service into the obligatory Reich Labor Service, in which men aged eighteen through twenty-five were required to serve six months; and the Nazis’ propaganda campaign against the labor force participation of women—not the Keynesian stimulus of which Joan Robinson admiringly spoke. The Nazis were a peculiarly German aberration, although they had analogs in antisystem parties in other countries experiencing deep depressions, whose mainstream parties showed little ability to cope with the consequences. But even where the result was not political extremism, deflation encouraged an interventionist response.

This was most notably the case in countries that clung to the gold standard—France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Italy—where deflation and depression were worst. Spending on final goods being in short supply, their governments resorted to tariffs and quotas to bottle it up. The Netherlands, having been faithful to free trade since the sixteenth century, now raised import duties by 25 percent and applied quotas and licensing fees to both imports and exports.34 France had negotiated commercial treaties with its neighbors in the 1920s under the leadership of the visionary pan-Europeanist foreign minister Aristide Briand; now it applied quotas, product by product and country by country. Belgium, an open economy reluctant to tax foreign goods for fear of retaliation, doubled its tariffs between 1928 and 1935 while, in self-protection, negotiating special bilateral agreements with its powerful French neighbor. Defending the strong lira established by Mussolini in 1927, Italy adopted the largest absolute increase in tariffs of any country save Germany and used comprehensive exchange controls as a lever for negotiating German-style bilateral clearing arrangements with its trading partners.35

Governments resorted to these disruptive interventions because existing institutions and policies had not delivered socially acceptable outcomes. If free trade did not deliver the goods, it followed that trade needed to be managed. If foreign lending was associated with instability, then foreign lending needed to be controlled. In fact, what made the Great Depression great were not the problems of trade or even foreign lending, but the flawed monetary and fiscal policies that flowed from a flawed monetary and fiscal regime. But where that regime was too deeply embedded to be uprooted, governments unable to respond by fiscal and monetary means responded in the only way they knew, by controlling trade and capital flows.

The alternative treatment, like chemotherapy administered to a cancer patient, had unfortunate side effects. Tariffs were not raised across the board. Instead, the most generous protection was afforded to the least efficient agricultural and industrial sectors, which were most desperate to attract spending and most at risk of losing sales to foreign competitors. These, naturally, were the sectors that lobbied most intensively for help and got it more often than not. Sectors propped up by protection grew accustomed to public support and adept at lobbying for its extension. The same sectors that benefited from these interventions in the 1930s, like agriculture, were again the recipients of the most generous protection after World War II.36

The consequences for international relations were even worse. Germany used its trade-policy levers to increase the dependence of its Eastern European neighbors on its economy.37 Trade-policy conflicts in turn hindered the efforts of the allies to form a united front against the Reich.

After 2008–09, central banks were criticized for cutting interest rates to zero and expanding their balance sheets in the effort to reflate their economies, on the grounds that those policies distorted financial conditions, threatened an outbreak of inflation, and had other damaging side effects. A close reading of the 1930s suggests that the counterfactual in which central banks sat on their hands would have seen even more damaging consequences.
