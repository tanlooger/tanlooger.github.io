title: Chapter 20 Stressed and Stimulated
---



Through all this, the president-elect and his team were watching uneasily. Lawrence Summers, chair-designate of Obama’s National Economic Council, and Christina Romer, selected to chair the Council of Economic Advisors, resisted the idea of more stealth bailouts on fairness and moral-hazard grounds.1 They preferred to find a way of seizing, recapitalizing, and reopening so-called too-big-to-fail institutions—nationalizing and quickly reprivatizing them while breaking them up along the way. Other academics farther from the seat of power argued the case for nationalization even more strongly.2 For the academics, the approach taken by Sweden to repair its banking system in the 1990s had considerable appeal: the authorities would seize the troubled financial institutions and transfer their toxic assets to a government-run “bad bank,” which would sell them off over time. The restructured banks could then be recapitalized and reopened, the shareholders having been wiped out and management unseated along the way.

But Obama’s political advisors, from Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel on down, feared sticker shock were the administration to go back to Congress for more funds to recapitalize the banks. Bank nationalization, even temporary nationalization, was anathema to large segments of the American public, not to mention to the banking lobby. Its academic advocates, unlike Treasury Secretary-Designate Timothy Geithner, had not been involved in the most recent round of bank rescues, allowing them to develop an idealized notion of how seamlessly nationalization and reprivatization would work. White House advisors toyed with the idea of testing out the Swedish approach on a single bank, where still-troubled Citibank was the obvious candidate, but the logistics were daunting. 分页。。。 Geithner, for his part, opposed any intervention that might disrupt business as usual and damage the prospects for recovery. He feared that nationalizing one bank might create expectations that others would follow, causing investors to sell their shares in a self-fulfilling prophecy. He was skeptical that there was such a thing as temporary nationalization. The step would demoralize the markets, rendering the nationalized institutions impossible to sell. About this aspect, at least, he was right, as countries like the UK, which went the nationalization route, would discover in the course of time.

But avoiding nationalization required coming up with an alternative, something that was easier said than done in the early days of a new administration, as Raymond Moley and William Woodin could have explained. Where Paulson’s Treasury was chaotic, Geithner’s was understaffed. Vetting senior appointees was laborious, and congressional confirmation was far from ensured. Although Treasury under Paulson had a thin bench of economists and finance specialists, the situation under Geithner was worse.

The result was reminiscent of how the Roosevelt administration, lacking ideas, adopted the bank rehabilitation plans of its predecessor. Similarly, Geithner’s plan was—wait for it—to use TARP funds, suitably leveraged, to buy toxic loans and assets from the banks. It was essentially an expansion of the TALF, which targeted consumer loans, to mortgage-backed securities, property loans, and CDOs. This was the essence of the Public-Private Investment Program for Legacy Assets, or PPIP, announced on March 23, 2009, for which $22 billion of TARP funds was earmarked.

There were other elements of continuity as well. Buying securities would require partnering with private fund managers, as in Paulson’s security purchase scheme.3 There would have to be a way of ensuring that fund managers had skin in the game, like the hedge funds that were the government’s partners in the TALF. In other words, if they bought securities for the government, they would also have to buy securities for themselves, at the same prices, as a way of ensuring they did not overpay. In addition to putting up TARP funds to buy securities directly, the Treasury, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve would guarantee each pool of securities purchased up to 85 percent of the amount bid by investors, much as they had guaranteed 90 percent of the legacy assets of Citigroup and Bank of America.4

PPIP excited much negative commentary for the same reasons that these earlier interventions did so. It was difficult to understand. It relied on mortgage securitization and leverage, the very forms of financial engineering that had given rise to the crisis. It involved another open-ended guarantee, exposing taxpayers to losses. It looked to be overpaying for toxic assets again, since the banks would be reluctant to sell at a loss. But the most serious problem was the same one that derailed Paulson’s original scheme for security purchases, namely the time needed to scale it up. The Fed had taken four full months to get the TALF up and running, and Treasury lacked its experienced staff. PPIP was finally launched in September 2009. Rather than removing $1 trillion of bad loans and assets from the banks’ balance sheets, the program ended up eliminating just $40 billion, a veritable drop in the financial bucket. With nationalization off the table and PPIP on hold, Treasury’s backup plan of stress-testing the banks was the only option left standing. Secretary Geithner unveiled the idea at a poorly received press conference on February 10, where attention focused on the asset-purchase program. Now the stress tests became the centerpiece of the strategy. Specialists at the Fed and the FDIC, working with Treasury, would construct scenarios for the performance of the banks’ mortgage loans, credit card loans, auto loans, and other assets. Nineteen big banks, together with their supervisors, would then estimate their losses under what was referred to as the adverse scenario, “adverse” being one rung up from “worst-case.” If a bank’s reserves were too small to plug the hole, it would have to raise more capital. If it had trouble raising capital from investors, it would have to take it from the government. With only needy institutions tapping public funds, the burden on taxpayers would be limited. And with every bank adequately capitalized, investors would be reassured. The banks, possessing the resources and cushion against losses to resume lending, could do their part to encourage recovery.

The exercise was greeted with skepticism on the part of investors, the informed public, and even the White House. Supervisors lacked the expertise to value complex securities, forcing them to defer to the banks and their in-house models. If their scenarios were too optimistic and the amount of new capital was small, the markets might dismiss the process as a charade. But if their scenarios were dire and the amount of capital was large, the banks might be unable to raise it, forcing them into the hands of the government in the nationalization scenario investors and officials both feared. Either way, confidence would be damaged rather than restored.

The stress testers thus had a Goldilocks problem: the porridge had to be neither too cold nor too hot. Not being required to value the banks’ assets at current market prices, they could instead tweak their model-based estimates of those prices to produce the desired result. Or they could adjust their assumptions about the banks’ future earnings growth.

Not surprisingly, the total ultimately selected—for selected it was—was $75 billion, roughly halfway between the low and high estimates of $35 billion and $125 billion.5 It was not so low as to be dismissed as a gift, nor so high as to make it impossible to raise. It was less than the $125 billion the government had compelled the nine big banks to take a few months earlier. Just in case, it was also less than the Treasury’s remaining TARP funds.

Bank stocks jumped when the results were released.6 With hindsight, it is clear that this marked the beginning of the end of the crisis. But, even now, just why is unclear. Geithner’s hunch, like Paulson’s before him, was that the banks were not, in fact, insolvent and that, with time and the support of investors, they could earn their way back to health. Not a few other supposed experts had asserted that the banks were insolvent and could be stabilized only by a massive infusion of public funds. In the event, the experts were wrong, while Geithner was right. The banks may not have leapt back into lending with both feet—in fact they dipped their toes in only cautiously—but they were able to steady themselves, raise additional capital, and get back to business.

Doing so required a modicum of investor confidence. Here it helped that the stress tests, unlike the earlier rescues of Bear Stearns, Citigroup, and Bank of America, were not thrown together over a weekend. They were just credible enough to inspire confidence. Appearance, in this case, made for reality. Such is the nature of banking, where confidence is in the eye of the beholder.

In 1933, when declaring the bank holiday, the Roosevelt administration similarly put up a good front. It solemnly declared that only solvent banks would be allowed to reopen. In reality, it was hardly possible in the subsequent two weeks to conduct careful inspections of each and every financial institution, urban legend notwithstanding. Yet the government permitted the vast majority of banks to reopen, providing only verbal reassurance that they were adequately capitalized.

The stress tests were now conducted with comparable solemnity and produced comparable results. Given their effects, it becomes necessary to view the 1933 bank holiday and its aftermath in a somewhat different light and to acknowledge that, like the stress tests, they involved more than a little showmanship.

A less happy interpretation is that the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval conferred by the tests was tantamount to a colossal government guarantee. The nineteen biggest banks received special attention. Treasury asserted that they were solvent. Nine of them, starting with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, required no additional capital. Citigroup, Bank of America, and eight of their less pristine competitors would be adequately capitalized if they raised only an additional $75 billion of capital, or so the government averred. If they then got into trouble, it stood to reason that this would be due to events not of their own making, and that the authorities, having attested to their soundness, would bail them out. In this respect as well, the response resembled 1933, when the Emergency Banking Act empowered the Federal Reserve to discount notes, drafts, bills, and acceptances as the central bank saw fit, allowing it to provide the banks the liquidity they needed to meet the needs of their depositors. And as in 1933, the policy response stabilized the banking system, but by opening the door to moral hazard on a massive scale. Or perhaps, as in 1933, it was not so much the measures addressed at the banking system as other policies that were responsible for the happy outcome. The most contentious responses were the Obama administration’s $787 billion fiscal stimulus and three rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve. The stimulus excited no end of controversy then and continues to do so today. The case was straightforward for those whose views were informed by the experience of the 1930s. The Hoover and Roosevelt administrations had done too little to offset the decline in private spending. Although the New Deal featured prominent public investment projects, from the Grand Coulee Dam to the Triborough Bridge, the increase in spending was too small to make a significant dent in a double-digit unemployment rate. All this was doubly unfortunate in an environment of near-zero interest rates, when there was little danger that an increase in public investment would crowd out a commensurate amount of private spending. The research of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisors chair, Christina Romer, pointed to the conclusion that fiscal policy made only a limited contribution to recovery because the fiscal initiatives of the period were small by the scale of the problem.7

This was the mistake whose repetition the Obama stimulus was designed to avoid. Moving an eleven-hundred-page bill from first draft to final passage in a bit more than three weeks was a considerable achievement. It was fast action even by the standards of FDR’s Hundred Days, which Obama like every subsequent president-elect had studied (and Obama was more studious than most). The act was hailed by House Appropriations Committee Chairman David Obey as “the largest change in domestic policy since the 1930s.” The Washington Post, de facto arbiter of such inside-the-Beltway matters, concluded that the stimulus bill represented “the start of a new ideological era that places the federal government at the center of the nation’s economic recovery.”8

Given these elevated expectations, it was all but inevitable that disappointment would follow. During the interregnum, Romer, along with Jared Bernstein, soon to be appointed Vice President Biden’s economic advisor, used a simple model to calculate how much stimulus was needed to offset the decline in private spending. This involved, first, estimating the decline in spending and hence the gap to be filled. Romer and Bernstein then divided the result by a textbook estimate of the fiscal multiplier.9 What could be easier?

Several things, it turned out. To start, output was already falling faster than anyone realized, rendering it inevitable that unemployment would rise higher and making the Romer-Bernstein team look too optimistic. Given the exceptional nature of the crisis—how firms, unable to get credit, were cutting back on production and drawing down their inventories at an unprecedented rate—it is not surprising that government surveys did not fully capture how quickly output was falling. Still, the fact that unemployment failed to stabilize at 8 percent as advertised enabled the critics to question the effectiveness of the policy. Their questions provided ammunition for the advocates of an early turn to austerity.

Moreover, the amount of stimulus finally agreed was less than suggested by Romer and Bernstein’s own calculations. Their modeling indicated that filling the output gap would require a stimulus of $1.2–1.8 trillion, depending on the magnitude of the contraction in the pipeline and the policies of the Federal Reserve. But numbers above $1 trillion were enough to give heartburn to even congressional Democrats. The Republicans had already labeled their opposition the party of tax-and-spend. They denigrated the legislation by appealing to the American public’s instinctive hostility to big government. “This bill is supposed to be about jobs, jobs, jobs, and it’s turned into nothing more than spend, spend, spend,” as House minority leader John Boehner put it.

An election might have just happened, but this also meant that midterms were a mere two years away. Keeping the Democrats in Congress on board thus required not making the increase in the deficit too large. $1 trillion was the trip wire; the political operatives were unanimous that the stimulus had to come in below this. Arguments were therefore offered for why $800 billion was enough. A larger stimulus would panic the markets. The rise in unemployment was baked in; nothing could be done to prevent it. It is not clear whether anyone believed these rationalizations. This was economic logic enlisted on behalf of political ends.

A few White House strategists imagined that Congress might solve their problem. Once the House and Senate added their bells and whistles, the final bill would be larger than requested by the administration. But this didn’t figure with the rise of the Tea Party, the loose populist coalition advocating reducing the size of government by any and all means, or with a refusal to cooperate on the part of House Republicans. It didn’t figure with political rancor set in motion by the crisis and the bailouts taken in response.

An administration and a president convinced of the merits of a larger stimulus could have campaigned for it. Obama could have invested the political capital he possessed as a result of his recent electoral victory. He could have appealed to GOP senators from swing states like Maine and Pennsylvania. Going over the heads of Congress, he could have appealed to the public. But Obama’s instinct was to weigh the options, not to campaign for his program. It was to compromise, not confront. The economic advisors who might have helped him make the case did not speak with one voice. And the political advisors agreed that an aggressive campaign for a larger stimulus was not the best use of the president’s political capital.

Finally, there was the conflict between shovel-ready projects promising an immediate economic impact and the longer-term agenda to renew the country’s infrastructure, enhance its energy efficiency, and invest in its people. Focusing on forms of stimulus spending that could be rolled out quickly was critical for containing the crisis. Without an immediate boost to spending, there would be nothing to break the vicious circle of private-sector deleveraging and financial-sector distress. Front-loading the stimulus was also a way of signaling that it was an exceptional measure to which the administration had been driven by exceptional circumstances and that it would be rolled back once the crisis passed. Reflecting these arguments, more than half of total stimulus spending was concentrated in 2009–10.

But insofar as this was the emphasis, it meant that the country’s structural problems went unaddressed. Geithner describes how during the transition Obama hoped for an inspiring project like a smart electric grid, but his advisors talked him out of it.10 The Obama administration would have no Grand Coulee Dam to point to in seeking continued support for its approach. Nine billion dollars for high-speed rail was a limp substitute. That the stimulus left no physical legacy allowed the skeptics to denigrate the effects and advocate quick abandonment.

Rather than a short recession followed by a vigorous recovery, the United States experienced an extended period of high unemployment. That recovery was slow meant the economy would have benefited from infrastructure investment that took years to roll out. The need for additional government spending was an opportunity to develop a coherent plan for spending on not just infrastructure but basic research and education, in order to better position the country to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

But this is different from saying it would have made sense to shift more of the $787 billion of stimulus away from transfers to state and local governments in 2009–10 and toward spending on long-term infrastructure projects in subsequent years. Fewer transfers to the states in 2009 would have meant more unemployment and financial distress, a high price to pay for infrastructure renewal. The circle could have been squared by adding appropriations for infrastructure spending without also cutting back on transfers to the states. But an even larger stimulus that would have permitted the government to pursue not-yet-shovel-ready projects without forcing it to cut back short-term spending was not in the political cards. And the throes of a crisis, when policy makers were struggling to prevent the financial system from seizing up, was an awkward time to ponder a national development plan. Evaluations of the stimulus continue to differ. But it is not enough for detractors to point to the fact that unemployment peaked out at 10.1 percent, two full percentage points higher than initially promised. Nor is it enough to observe, à la Mervyn King, that another Great Depression was avoided. The question must be posed as a problem in counterfactual history. How much higher would unemployment have been without the stimulus? Would there have been a Great Depression–like slump in its absence?

Any serious effort to answer these questions requires a model of the economy that can be put through its paces with the stimulus and without. Different models predictably yield different results. Keynesian models with a large fiscal multiplier point to large positive effects. In contrast, classical full-employment models in which interest rates rise with public spending, causing a commensurate amount of private spending to be crowded out, suggest no positive output effects. In the world of evidence-free modeling, anything goes.

But the world of modeling, and more generally the world itself, is not evidence free. Models have implications that can be set against evidence as external tests of validity. The classical model predicts, to pick an example not entirely at random, that the stimulus should have driven up interest rates, whereas the Keynesian model does not. The fact that interest rates remained low thus favors one class of models over the other.

Although government agencies like the Congressional Budget Office typically employ several models for purposes of policy analysis, the models they use are limited to those whose implications are not wildly inconsistent with the facts. Employing a number of data-consistent models, CBO estimated that real GDP was 1.7–4.5 percent higher in the second quarter of 2010 with the stimulus than without, after which the effect diminished.11 The actual fall in GDP between 2007 and 2009 was 3.4 percent. The midpoint of the CBO’s high and low estimates thus suggests that the output loss would have been about twice as large in the absence of the stimulus. The number of full-time-equivalent jobs was 2.0–4.8 million higher, according to its estimates, than in the absence of the stimulus.12

The experience of other countries, where policies and economic outcomes differ, is another basis on which to evaluate US experience. If the recession was deeper and longer in countries where circumstances were otherwise similar but stimulus spending was less, then the magnitude of the difference can be used to identify the relevant counterfactual. International organizations like the IMF engage in this kind of counterfactual thinking. The work of the Fund’s chief economist, Olivier Blanchard, points to fiscal multipliers above 1 (1.3 is the middle of his estimated range). This suggests that, other things equal, $400 billion of stimulus spending in calendar year 2010 raised GDP by $520 billion, or roughly 4 percent in a $13 trillion economy.13 The conclusion is consistent with the range suggested by the CBO’s modeling.

A related strategy is to compare the change in output and employment across US states and counties receiving differing amounts of federal funding. James Feyrer and Bruce Sacerdote of Dartmouth College adopted this approach, finding substantial effects of aid to low-income individuals and infrastructure spending and sizable impacts of the stimulus overall. The effect is smaller than estimated by the CBO and the IMF but still considerable. A team of Berkeley, Stanford, and MIT economists adopting a similar approach made use of the fact that Medicaid matching funds provided by the stimulus varied widely across states. (On a per capita basis, Washington, D.C., received almost five times the per capita transfers of Utah.) They concluded that $100,000 of additional matching funds increased employment by 3.5 job-years and that an additional $100,000 of federal outlays raised final spending by as much as $200,000.14 This suggests an even larger impact than other approaches.

Finally, historical experience provides a basis for imagining the counterfactual. Eighty years of scholarship may not have produced universal agreement on the effects of New Deal policies, but it has yielded a broad consensus on what worked and what didn’t, on which policies were more and less important, and what should have been tried but wasn’t. It suggests that fiscal policy worked where it was tried and didn’t where it wasn’t. It points to the effectiveness of policies that put money in consumers’ pockets, like the 1936 Veterans’ Bonus, but also to the case for taking advantage of singularly low borrowing rates to finance infrastructure projects. It suggests that public spending, whether for rearmament or other purposes, had especially large effects in an environment of near-zero interest rates. All this implies that the Obama stimulus helped, but that it would have helped more had policy makers aimed higher.
