title: Chapter 16 Something for Everyone
---



The new deal involved much more than just changes in monetary and fiscal policies. FDR and his Brains Trust quickly realized that they could use the special session of Congress to push through a variety of additional measures before the sense of urgency passed. There was the Civilian Conservation Corps, a favorite of a conservation-minded president who as governor had assigned ten thousand unemployed New Yorkers to reforestation projects. There was the Tennessee Valley Authority to improve navigation, undertake flood-control projects, and supply cheap electricity. There was the Federal Emergency Relief Administration to give the states $500 million for payments to the poor and unemployed.

Above all, there were the Agricultural Adjustment Act and National Industrial Recovery Act, the New Deal’s signature programs. George Warren and Rex Tugwell may have belonged to rival advisory factions, but they shared a concern for agriculture. They also shared a diagnosis of its ills centering on overproduction and depressed prices. The growth of production was a fact, if not one limited to the United States. It reflected increases in acreage under cultivation in Canada, Argentina, and Australia during and after World War I. Low prices were also a fact and one for which the Smoot-Hawley Tariff made little difference, as we saw above.

For FDR, these problems were a priority. His first successful campaign was in the rural districts of Dutchess County, New York, and where farmers were a key constituency. His advisors, led by Raymond Moley, noted that many bank failures were in areas where farmers suffered from depressed prices. Moley thus saw addressing the farm problem as important for solving the banking crisis. 分页。。。 But the plan—an agency to make federal payments to farmers limiting production—was less than ideal. Farmers were offered acreage reduction contracts obliging them not to cultivate a portion of their land, and were compensated accordingly. The payment was financed by a tax on millers who ground wheat into flour, along with other commodity processors, in order to create the impression that farmers were not being financed by the taxpayer.

Better would have been to subsidize the adoption of new techniques so farmers could cut costs and live with the reality of abundance. Another bureau, the Farm Credit Administration, went some way in this direction by providing farmers with low-interest loans for mortgages and the purchase of inputs. But the administration could have gone further down this road. Its failure to do so is more striking for the fact that Roosevelt appointed as his agriculture secretary Henry A. Wallace, a farmer with a degree in animal husbandry who founded Hi-Bred Corn, a company that developed and sold high-yielding hybrid seed varieties. Hi-Bred became Pioneer Hi-Bred before eventually being sold to the DuPont Corporation, while Wallace became FDR’s vice presidential running mate in 1940, succeeding John Nance Garner. From the vice presidency he went on to serve as commerce secretary, thereby becoming the only former vice president to serve in the cabinet. Wallace then ran as Progressive Party candidate for the presidency in 1948 on a platform advocating an end to the Cold War and to segregation.

As a pioneer in the commercialization of hybrid seed, Wallace appreciated the promise of cost-cutting technology. But even the innovation-minded Wallace also supported crop set-asides. Linking subsidy checks to adoption of new seed or machinery, if more efficient in the long run, would have done little to alleviate the farmers’ immediate plight. And relief was urgent, given increasingly violent farm protests. It was urgent given the administration’s worry that pressure from farm interests might force adoption of populist monetary policies.1 However valid the argument that overproduction leading to low prices was a problem for agriculture, it clearly had no relevance to industry. Cost-reducing technological change in manufacturing, as symbolized by electrification and the assembly line, was rapid in the 1920s.2 Profits were healthy. In contrast to agriculture, increases in the supply of manufactures did not outstrip demand until spending collapsed in the 1930s.

But such observations did not prevent Roosevelt’s economists from generalizing their diagnosis of agriculture’s ills to the rest of the economy. If prices were low, then this reflected excess supply and ruinous competition. And if the problem was ruinous competition, the solution was to limit output and raise prices. On sending Congress the bill establishing the National Recovery Administration, Roosevelt described his goal as “to prevent unfair competition and disastrous overproduction.”3 Section 3(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act provided for codes of fair competition under which firms would limit production and raise prices. The act suspended antitrust laws in order to remove legal impediments to collaboration. In the event that firms working together did not achieve the desired result, Section 4(b) allowed the president to intervene to prevent destructive wage and price reductions.

And if excessive competition leading to low prices was a problem in product markets, then why not also in labor markets? The provisions of the NIRA protecting the right of workers to organize can be seen in this light. Encouraging producers to act collectively but not allowing workers to do so would have been politically unbalanced in any case. If employers were going to enjoy higher prices and profits, it followed that they should be compelled to share them with their employees. And to ensure that those benefits were distributed widely, the available work should be spread by limiting hours.

This is the best one can do in attempting to reconstruct a logic for the NIRA. It reflected the tendency for Roosevelt and his advisors, men like George Warren and Henry Wallace, to generalize from the problems of agriculture to the economy as a whole. It drew inspiration from a plan offered already in 1931 by Gerard Swope, president of General Electric, in which he recommended suspension of federal antitrust laws to enable firms to limit excess production and raise prices, together with higher pay and fringe benefits for workers to share the wealth. It was informed by the views of Adolph Berle, a founding member of the Brains Trust, whose work emphasized that the era of the small family firm was over and government had a role in ensuring that large corporations served the public purpose.4

The alternative is to acknowledge that there was not, in fact, a coherent logic for the NIRA. It was an effort to demonstrate that the new president and Congress were prepared to do something, anything, to shock the economy out of its torpor. The NIRA offered something for everyone: for planners who believed that industry needed government direction; for associationalists who saw the solution as producers acting together; for progressives who sought collaboration between employers and workers; for labor leaders fighting for the right to organize; for followers of Senator Hugo Black, Democrat from Alabama, who advocated work sharing; and for social reformers seeking to outlaw child labor. That FDR appointed several groups of advisors to draw up language and then combined their recommendations suggests something for everything was just what he wanted.

A kickoff campaign of parades and public events in June 1933 encouraged two million employers to sign a provisional blanket code. Signatories agreed to pay a minimum wage and limit weekly hours to thirty-five or forty. The blanket code was then superseded by codes for each individual industry, more than five hundred in number, establishing price floors and allowing workers to bargain collectively. With government approval came the antitrust exemption and permission to display the Blue Eagle symbol.

From a macroeconomic standpoint, the result was a disaster. It was a classic case of prioritizing reform over recovery, as Keynes put it in his open letter. The act did nothing to stimulate demand.5 But by pushing up costs, it limited supply (limiting supply of course being precisely the goal). Between July and September, hourly wages rose 22 percent, 19 percent adjusted for the rise in prices, something that is otherwise inexplicable in a period of double-digit unemployment. With higher costs came lower output. In the first half of 1933 industrial production rose and fell in step with the price level. After adoption of the blanket code, industrial production dropped sharply even while prices continued to rise.6

That the NIRA was destructive of efforts to stimulate recovery is all but unanimously agreed by economists. Michael Weinstein, working in the Keynesian tradition, estimates that the NIRA, by pushing up costs, knocked a cumulative 8 percent off output. Friedman and Schwartz, leading monetarists, conclude that investment was significantly depressed by the profit squeeze. Harold Cole and Lee Ohanian, exponents of the new classical approach to business cycle analysis, assert that unemployment was as much as a quarter higher than in the absence of the NIRA.7 Who says economists can’t agree?

In addition to its direct effect on costs, the NIRA was criticized for creating uncertainty. Codes differed across industries. Enforcement was erratic. By early 1935 state offices charged with monitoring compliance with the law had noted more than thirty thousand “trade practice complaints,” only a fraction of which were pursued. Some of this criticism was simply business pushing back against government interference. These problems may also have been exaggerated by the press, which was hostile to the NIRA code promulgated for the newspaper industry.8 There may be a kernel of truth in business complaints about uncertainty and red tape, but the effects should not be overstated. William Anderson’s analysis of the variance of stock prices suggests that the NIRA did not reduce the risks facing firms, but neither did it raise them significantly.9

The ultimate uncertainty was whether the Supreme Court would rule the NIRA unconstitutional on the grounds that it delegated prerogatives assigned by the Constitution to Congress instead to the executive branch. The occasion for doing this was an appeal in 1935 by Schechter Poultry Corporation, a Brooklyn-based company that lost its Blue Eagle (irony intended) for selling diseased chickens across state lines. The decision came to be known, for obvious reasons, as the “sick chicken case.” The NIRA violated the constitutional separation of powers, the court ruled. By applying codes to Schechter, moreover, Congress had exceeded what was permissible under the Commerce Clause, since the Schechter brothers merely bought chickens in other states; the birds they slaughtered in New York stayed in New York.

Chastened by the court, FDR dropped more than four hundred cases claiming code violations and left for a weekend cruise aboard the presidential yacht. As the Chicago Tribune put it, “The cackling of the sacred geese saved Rome from the Barbarians, and clucking of Mr. Schechter’s hens has saved the United States from the New Deal.”10

The Court next invalidated the Railway Pensions Act, which had created a pension scheme for 1½ million railroad workers, for imposing an unfair burden on large railways.11 It overturned the Agricultural Adjustment Administration for levying an unfair tax on commodity processors.

Roosevelt responded to this setback by replacing the objectionable provisions of the NIRA with more carefully crafted measures. The National Labor Board was replaced by a National Labor Relations Board. The minimumwage and child-labor provisions of the NIRA were replaced by more clearly drafted measures under the Fair Labor Standards Act. A second Agricultural Adjustment Act addressed the defects of its predecessor, financing payments to farmers out of general revenues rather than a tax on food processors.

In addition, FDR pushed harder for initiatives promising to mobilize public support for the New Deal, like federal pensions (Social Security) and welfare (the Works Progress Administration, created earlier but now expanded). Most famously, he sought to pack the Supreme Court with sympathetic appointees. Though the tactic damaged the president politically, it succeeded in moderating the Court’s opposition to government intervention. In particular, the justices, responding to the pressure, adopted a more expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause.12

The effects are clear. The legal framework and doctrines pioneered by the National Labor Board did much to shape the subsequent National Labor Relations Act. For better or worse, the first AAA shaped the provisions of the second. Some New Deal programs, like the Civilian Conservation Corps and Works Progress Administration, were temporary, but others like Social Security, welfare, unemployment insurance, the minimum wage, child labor laws, and the right to organize became indelible features of the American landscape. Inevitably, this observation points to the question of why the progressive response to the Great Recession was so much more limited than its New Deal predecessor. In terms of social programs, the post-2008 response was limited mainly to health care reform, and even that was an uphill fight. Rather than expanding existing programs, there was pressure from the Republican Party for retrenchment—to cut back on the provision of food stamps, for example. There was nothing remotely resembling the earlier expansion of social protections in the wake of the Great Depression.

The contrast is equally stark when we consider financial regulation. The Glass-Steagall Act of June 1933 not only forced commercial banks to divest themselves of securities affiliates but established deposit insurance and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a government entity with the power to resolve insolvent banks.13 Glass-Steagall was far-reaching reform, much more far-reaching than the banking reforms of 2010.

What explains the contrast? It is not as if bank and business lobbies were less well organized in the 1930s. State bank associations campaigned intensively against both more liberal branching laws, which exposed their members to new competition, and burdensome regulations, including deposit insurance. The Missouri Bankers Association sent delegations to Washington to impress upon lawmakers the depth of its opposition. The American Bankers Association vehemently opposed deposit insurance. Association president Francis Sisson denounced insurance as “unsound, unscientific, unjust, and dangerous” for forcing careful banks to pay for the mistakes of their reckless competitors. The association flooded the White House with telegrams in a last-ditch effort to get FDR to veto Glass-Steagall.14

Nor is it obvious that banks suffered more adverse publicity. To be sure, there were the sensational 1933 hearings of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency directed by Ferdinand Pecora, the incorruptible, cigar-chewing former assistant district attorney for New York.15 But Pecora was a financial neophyte. He was better at uncovering bad behavior by individual bankers than laying bare structural flaws in the financial system. And to the extent that Pecora focused on a few bad apples, reflecting his limited knowledge of the workings of Wall Street, the hearings made the case for systemic reform (as opposed to punishing individual malefactors) less compelling. It is hard to argue, anyway, that the public anger he whipped up was so much greater than that greeting Wall Street’s titans when they testified to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission in 2010.

Prior to the adoption of Glass-Steagall, Pecora in fact examined just one commercial bank, National City. The ten days of hearings, centering on the testimony of its chairman, Charles Mitchell, were gripping, but they focused more on the questionable actions of one individual than on systematic problems. Mitchell was known as “Sunshine Charley” for his perennially positive outlook, and he arrived wearing an Angelo Mozilo–style tan acquired on vacation in the Bahamas. Mitchell, like Mozilo, had started out as a salesman, in his case of Liberty Bonds. He had the smooth manner of the type, which did not serve him well in this context. The most sensational revelation was that Mitchell had sold eighteen thousand National City shares to his wife and bought them back subsequently in order to reduce his tax liability. Mitchell was forced to resign his chairmanship, thus becoming the first victim of New Deal financial reform. But that was it for Pecora’s pre-Glass-Steagall interrogation of the commercial banks.

On May 23 Pecora turned to investment banking and specifically to J. P. Morgan & Co. Here the shocking revelation was that the firm had given preferential access to initial public offerings to prominent insiders, including William Woodin, the newly appointed Treasury secretary; Charles Dawes, of RFC and Dawes Bank fame; and Owen D. Young. But again these disclosures did not speak to such substantive issues as the separation of investment and commercial banking, the desirability of branching, or the need for deposit insurance. And the revelations, however damning, were no more embarrassing than the knowledge that Goldman Sachs had aided John Paulson’s efforts to construct a toxic asset portfolio for use in shorting the housing market, or that Countrywide Financial had provided mortgages on favorable terms to “friends of Anglo,” including Fannie Mae Chief Executive Franklin Raines and Senate Banking Committee member Christopher Dodd.16

In some sense, the reformers were simply pushing on an open door. On March 7, well before the adoption of the Glass-Steagall Act, National City Bank announced that it was liquidating its securities affiliate. The next day Chase National Bank declared that it would follow suit. This was a victory for board chairman Winthrop Aldrich over the opposition of former bank president Albert Wiggin, who shared Jimmy Cayne’s passion for poker and built Chase National into the financial conglomerate it was.17 Wiggin had resigned his presidency of the bank in December 1932, shortly before he was revealed by the Pecora Commission to have begun selling his shares in Chase even while using his bank’s money to support them. The Securities and Exchange Commission later adopted a provision prohibiting short sales by insiders known as the “anti-Wiggin Section.”

But the point is that, new issuance having collapsed, the banks were more than ready to abandon the securities business. The collapse of security markets was so complete that the banks saw no hope of reviving them. The Glass-Steagall separation of commercial and investment banking simply validated a transition that was already underway.18 There were again significant dislocations in securitization markets starting in 2008, but a 1930s-style collapse was averted by the extensive interventions of the Federal Reserve and others. Looking forward, the banks could foresee the recovery of their underwriting and trading activities. And indeed, within five years many of the activities for which pre-2008 securitization markets were notorious were back. Not only were the big banks seeking to maintain their existing range of activities, but some were attempting to expand them further. All this caused the industry to resist efforts to rein in practices like proprietary trading.

Another explanation sometimes offered for the success of 1930s reform is that members of Congress had already come to a common diagnosis of the problem. Senator Glass pushed for years for more expansive branching laws and centralized supervision of the banking and financial system. More than a hundred bills for establishing a federal system of deposit insurance were introduced in Congress over the preceding fifty years. One such measure, introduced in April 1932 and co-sponsored by Representative Henry Steagall, received majority support in the House, if not yet the Senate. But Steagall opposed centralized supervision and more extensive branching, while Glass opposed deposit insurance. Their followers were similarly divided.

Nor does the explanation lie in the legislative process. On other issues Congress deferred to FDR, “treating him more like a prime minister than a traditional American president.”19 The Emergency Banking Act of March and the National Industrial Recovery Act of April were passed virtually unchanged from the drafts the administration sent to the Hill. But the specifics of banking reform were contested in both chambers. Roosevelt himself was skeptical of deposit insurance. As a former governor, he was aware of the checkered history of earlier state deposit insurance schemes. The official photograph of the president signing the Banking Act creating FDIC insurance does not show him to have been especially happy about the fact. Treasury Secretary Woodin, a manufacturer of railway freight cars and only secondarily a financier, similarly saw no justification for extending special treatment to the banks. What is true of the executive branch was true also of the Federal Reserve System: leading Federal Reserve officials similarly opposed deposit insurance.20 Ultimately, the explanation for such far-reaching reform can only be the severity of the crisis. It brought the financial system and the economy to their knees. It robbed the banks of all interest in holding onto their securities business. It created a groundswell of support for reforms like deposit insurance sufficient to overcome the opposition of entrenched interests. Millions of Americans had their life’s savings placed at risk by the banking crisis. Their alarm created strong support for deposit insurance, and more generally for far-reaching financial reform.21 It gave the reformers not just the mandate but the votes.

And what was true of financial reform was true more widely. The depth of the Depression and the hardship and distress it caused were the fundamental factors lending momentum to the push for social reform.

After 2008, in contrast, the success of policy makers in preventing the worst took the wind out of the reformers’ sails. Fewer than one thousand banks failed, compared to more than nine thousand in the 1930s. Where the Dow Jones Average fell by nearly 90 percent from its peak in 1929 to its trough in 1933, the Standard and Poor’s 500 fell by significantly less, by 56 percent, in the seventeen months from October 2007. This was still an alarming decline in asset values, to be sure, but it pales in comparison with the 1930s.

Similarly, it took only months in 2008–09, not more than three years, to organize a monetary and fiscal response. Unemployment still peaked at a distressing 10 percent in 2009, but this was much lower than the catastrophic 25 percent of 1933. Deprivation and hardship there were. Hunger and homelessness were widespread. But still, distress did not rise to the level of the Hoovervilles and Dust Bowl of the 1930s.

After 2008, business as usual may no longer have been possible, but business near usual still was. The very success with which twenty-first-century policy makers prevented their crisis from causing another Great Depression thus limited support for radical reform. President Obama may not have consciously prioritized recovery over reform, the opposite of FDR. But it turned out that way. Securities-market regulation was different only insofar as the reformers were writing on a blank slate. There was no meaningful federal regulation of US capital markets before the Securities Act of 1933. Protecting investors from fraudulent practices was left to the states. Kansas passed the first blue-sky law requiring registration of securities brokers in 1911 in response to complaints that itinerant financial peddlers were selling shares in mythical mining companies to unsuspecting investors.22 Responding to exaggerated claims of what was achieved and then to the financial excesses associated with the Florida land boom, other states followed suit.

Although these blue-sky laws were intended to hold financial salesmen to minimum standards, they were easily circumvented by out-of-state brokers selling securities by mail. Many state agencies in any case lacked the ability to enforce their laws. Only eight states appropriated the resources necessary for operation of a full-time securities commission. Even where such commissions operated full-time, they lacked the capacity to detect and prosecute fraud. This was the case with the New York State attorney general’s efforts to enforce the Martin Act, adopted in 1921 to fight financial fraud.23

In their defense, securities market professionals pointed to vigorous self-regulation. The New York Stock Exchange claimed to hold aspiring issuers to higher transparency standards than any of the states with blue-sky laws— and certainly New York. The exchange’s listing committee required issuers to provide information on balance sheets, profits, and corporate governance. But the information content of these disclosures was less than met the eye. In the absence of generally accepted accounting standards, issuers could choose what information to report and how to report it. A 1929 study of 580 firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange found that barely half reported gross income.24 And if a firm found even these guidelines too restrictive, it could simply register on the Curb Exchange (subsequently the American Stock Exchange), where still less disclosure was required.

Nor did self-regulation prevent insider trading and market manipulation. To the contrary, members of the New York Exchange’s listing committee were among the organizers of the notorious pools that drove stock prices up and down in the 1920s. Such practices alarmed the Brandeisians, the justice’s 1914 collection of essays, Other People’s Money, having focused on how money translated into power. Along with identifying a problem, Brandeis prescribed a solution, namely transparency. “Publicity,” he wrote in a passage that President Roosevelt was fond of quoting, “is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most efficient policeman.”25

Brandeis’ acolytes, in the persons of Felix Frankfurter and his followers, now grasped the opportunity to translate these principles into action. The 1933 Securities Act governing new issues and the 1934 Securities Exchange Act regulating secondary market trading liberally applied Brandeis’ disinfectant. The question was how far to push the public sector’s role. It was whether, in addition to requiring disclosure, regulatory agencies should be empowered to assess that information and act on it. The bill the administration sent to Congress proposed creation of a federal commission with the power to evaluate the merits of stock offerings and prohibit them where it judged a filing as inadequate.26

For Representative Sam Rayburn, the powerful Commerce Committee chairman and future House speaker, this was a bridge too far. Frankfurter’s boys were called back to revise the bill. Under the revision, information on profits, losses, and compensation of corporate officers would be validated not by the government but by independent auditors using standardized accounting procedures. This would make the accountancy profession one of the few beneficiaries of the Great Depression.

But there might be other practices, like the pools of the 1920s, from which more informative listing documents afforded little protection. Thus the 1934 act also outlawed market manipulation and created a government agency, the SEC, with the authority to pursue it. The Securities Exchange Act contained a Section 10(b) authorizing the commission to address abusive practices like insider trading and fraud not covered by other sections.

This was the template that guided regulation of US securities markets for the better part of the twentieth century. While enshrining the principle of caveat emptor, it recognized that there were practices against which the individual emptor could not caveat himself. If left unaddressed, these might discourage future generations from participating in the stock market, just as they discouraged the 1930s generation. Oversight was needed not simply to protect the investor but to allow securities markets and the economy to flourish. The new template rejected self-regulation as a basis for such oversight. What was necessary instead was an SEC with sufficient human and financial resources to root out market manipulation and fraud.

This model served the country well for more than fifty years. But as memories of the 1930s faded, confidence in self-regulation rose from the grave. And even among those willing to acknowledge the possibility of market failure, there was skepticism about the ability of underpaid, overtaxed public employees to detect it.

Ultimately, this skepticism proved self-fulfilling. Funding for the SEC barely kept pace with inflation and lagged behind stock issuance in the 1990s. After September 11, 2001, the perceived need to devote more budgetary resources to another kind of security—national security—combined with the Bush administration’s skepticism of regulation to starve the SEC of resources. In the same way that the New York State attorney general lacked the resources to enforce the state’s blue-sky law in the 1920s, the SEC lacked the resources to exercise adequate oversight of financial markets now. The result was Charles Ponzi by another name. His name was Bernie Madoff. Mortgage relief is a last area where the response in the 1930s was more far-reaching than anything in recent years. But in this case it is not possible to argue that a more serious crisis led to a more concerted response. The post-2006 slump in home prices and construction was, in fact, every bit as serious as that of the 1930s, reflecting the extent to which the earlier expansion was led by housing. In both cases, sales prices fell by a third from peak to trough. Nonfarm housing starts fell to just 10 percent of 1920s levels in the depths of the Depression, compared to barely 25 percent of the 2005 level in 2010.27

If not a more pronounced slump in home prices, what then explains the more concerted response in the 1930s? The answer lies in the structure of housing finance. Lenders, recall, required down payments of as much as half the purchase price. As a result, few homeowners found themselves with mortgages exceeding the value of their homes even when prices fell by a third. This eliminated the need for radical write-downs of principal, which would create large losses for the banks or significant costs to the taxpayer. Bridging measures that kept housing finance flowing and provided help with interest payments could thus go a long way toward resolving the crisis.

Initially, Hoover took a characteristically voluntarist approach to the problem, appointing expert committees to study the housing market and convening a December 1931 conference on home building and ownership. But he also revived an earlier proposal by the Senate Committee on Reconstruction and Production (the Calder Committee, chaired by William M. Calder, the senator from New York) to address the post–World War I housing shortage by creating a Federal Home Loan Bank System. Calder was the son of a builder. He trained as a carpenter and was formerly the building commissioner for the Borough of Brooklyn, all of which heightened his interest in housing.28 The Home Loan Bank System as he saw it would provide liquidity and oversight to building and loan associations, comparable to the liquidity and oversight that the newly created Federal Reserve System was making available to their commercial bank competitors. This was the proposal Hoover now sought to revive. The December presidential conference endorsed it, and Congress followed with the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932.

But the Federal Home Loan Banks extended loans only to building and loan associations (not surprisingly, since the United States Building & Loan League helped draft the legislation), while ignoring the problems of other housing lenders. And they did nothing to offer borrowers interest-rate relief. More comprehensive and effective measures would have to wait on the change in administration.

These took the form of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, or HOLC, yet another product of the Hundred Days. The HOLC rolled over mortgages, giving borrowers interest rate relief but leaving principal intact. Its mortgages bore an interest rate of 5 percent, as opposed to rates of 6 to 8 percent on conventional loans, and ran an unprecedented fifteen years to maturity.29

The trick was transferring mortgages to the corporation without damaging bank balance sheets or straining the public purse. The HOLC purchased mortgages in exchange for bonds guaranteed by the government. Those bonds paid an interest rate of only 1 to 3.5 percent but were free of default risk. A liquid secondary market in HOLC bonds was quick to develop, allowing banks to convert them into cash. Importantly, banks were free to reject HOLC offers. This meant that mortgage lenders benefited from the program.

The difference between what the HOLC earned and what it paid the bondholders gave it a margin with which to work. The HOLC further limited its exposure by restricting loans to 80 percent of the value of property.30 Borrowers thus had skin in the game. Further declines in prices would have had to be substantial, in other words, to trigger widespread defaults. The 80 percent threshold was just high enough to permit a borrower who had made a 50 percent down payment but seen his property values fall by a third to stay in his home.31

Over its life, the HOLC bought more than a million mortgages. It held mortgages on one in ten nonfarm owner-occupied homes and fully 20 percent of home mortgage debt by 1936.32 By taking toxic mortgages off bank balance sheets, it helped to resolve the banking crisis. It also helped the housing market. Charles Courtemache and Kenneth Snowden find that counties with HOLC offices, where the corporation’s activities were most extensive, had higher home values and home ownership rates at the end of the 1930s. Price Fishback and his coauthors find that the HOLC encouraged construction activity by limiting the incidence of defaults and foreclosures. In particular, its loans increased the supply of housing in smaller cities where problems in a few local banks could have major repercussions for the construction sector and generally.33

All this was achieved at limited cost, because down payments were large, obviating the need for reductions in principal. This in turn limited the need to impose losses on the banks, of the sort that principal reductions would have entailed, and losses for the government, which would have resulted if the HOLC paid more for loans.34 Someone still had to bear the losses from lower home values. In the event, that someone was the homeowner. Except insofar as it limited downward pressure on home prices by limiting defaults, the HOLC did nothing to change this.35 But by keeping mortgage credit flowing and reducing interest rates, it was able to keep families in their homes, limiting a major source of distress.

The irony was that the HOLC and other New Deal housing reforms, like the Federal Housing Administration created in 1934 to insure long-term mortgages, reshaped the market in ways that set the stage for the 2008–09 crisis. Mortgages were now federally guaranteed, encouraging financial institutions to accept smaller down payments. The 20 percent norm established by the HOLC remained the standard for down payments even after the corporation was wound up. Depression-era policies also helped to create national appraisal and construction standards that encouraged funds to flow more copiously into regions with booming housing markets. Most controversially, there was the creation of Fannie Mae in 1938 to encourage new lending by purchasing Federal Housing Administration–insured home mortgages from local banks.

It is not right to argue that these 1930s changes were responsible for the housing boom and bust after the turn of the century. But without them, the housing boom and subprime crisis could not have taken the form they did.
