title: Chapter 19 Preventing the Worst
---



In 2011, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Bank of England Governor Mervyn King succinctly summarized what had been achieved by the response to the crisis. “We prevented a Great Depression,” King baldly stated. Readers may have been inclined to dismiss the comment, coming from a leading central banker, as self-aggrandizing hyperbole, but King’s assertion was not inconsistent with the facts. Global GDP dropped by a disastrous 15 percent between the peak in 1929 and the trough in 1932. Between 2008 and 2009, in contrast, it fell by just a fraction of 1 percent, and growth resumed already in 2010.1 Even in the advanced countries hit hardest, the fall in 2009 was 3.5 percent of GDP, and growth turned positive again the next year. All was not sweetness and light, but this at least was no Great Depression.

There is no question that policy makers deserved much of the credit. Not all of it, of course. Changes in economic structure over the intervening decades also helped to moderate the slump, insofar as the relatively volatile industrial sector became less important in the advanced economies, while the stabler service sector acquired a heavier weight. The growth of government strengthened the effectiveness of automatic fiscal stabilizers, which work mainly by reducing tax payments when incomes fall. Nothing similar happened in the 1930s, since taxes accounted for a much smaller share of GDP and because governments did what they could to prevent deficits from emerging. The institutionalization of the global trading system, culminating in creation of a World Trade Organization with binding dispute-settlement powers, discouraged resort to beggar-thy-neighbor trade restrictions.2 Central bank cooperation was fostered by regular meetings at the Bank for International Settlements. Solidarity among governments was forged by heads of state and ministers meeting as the G20. 分页。。。 These institutional developments built in turn on the lessons of the 1930s. The growth of government reflected the conviction, seemingly ineluctable in the wake of the Great Depression, that the market left to its own devices was unstable. It reflected the conclusion that if individuals were unable to protect themselves from the vicissitudes of an unstable market, then government would have to protect them, if capitalism was to survive. New Deal programs establishing work relief, unemployment insurance, and Social Security are all to be understood in this light.

Similarly, belief in the importance of fiscal stabilizers was an implication of the theories developed by John Maynard Keynes in response to the Depression. These theories showed that fiscal policy is especially powerful in a depression, when interest rates approach zero. The worst thing governments can do, economists concluded on the basis of this experience, is to raise taxes and cut public spending in a slump. Central banks were reorganized to prevent the monetary mistakes of the 1930s from being repeated. Decision-making power was centralized in the hands of the Federal Reserve Board, as we have seen, to prevent the Reserve banks from working at cross purposes. Efforts to strengthen the institutions of international economic cooperation were likewise animated by the view that they had failed disastrously in the 1930s.

The institutions for the most part survived intact, though the historical lessons inspiring their creation did not. Initially, central banks responded more forcefully than in 1929, making use of their enhanced powers. Governments cut taxes and boosted public spending to offset the fall in private demand. In April 2009, at the London G20 summit that was the high point of international cooperation, they agreed to coordinate their fiscal initiatives and shun beggar-thy-neighbor policies. The US Congress extended the duration of unemployment benefits to ninety-nine weeks. It increased food stamp eligibility and benefits in recognition that the crisis was having a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable.

Although the specifics varied across countries, the response, qualitatively, was everywhere the same. Given the speed with which the crisis unfolded, there was no alternative to relying on the institutions and instincts developed in response to the Great Depression. And given the challenge of making sense of the unprecedented news flow, there was little resistance to relying on the kind of monetary and fiscal stimulus, financial triage, and extensions of the safety net that post-Depression thinking deemed appropriate for a crisis as serious as that of the 1930s.

Following this initial push, however, the debate and with it the policy response began to shift. Conservative critics had long been concerned by the growth of government and warned against excessive deficits. Now they began pushing back against the budget deficits and government programs associated with fiscal stimulus. Debt sustainability rather than high employment or growth became the priority. At the February 2010 Group of Seven meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in Iqaluit, remote Northern Canada, the call for austerity was embraced under the Northern Lights. Fiscal consolidation rather than stimulus became the focus, even though economies were still far from fully recovered from the crisis.

In Europe, health care and pensions for retirees were cut in the name of fiscal consolidation. The 2012 presidential campaign in the United States was dominated less by the plight of the unemployed than by the “47 percent” of the population that, in the words of Republican candidate Mitt Romney, was “dependent on the government.” Romney may not have triumphed, but his rhetoric and arguments did. Or so it seemed when Congress limited access to food stamps, and North Carolina replaced extensions in unemployment benefits with cuts in relief.

Similarly, the opponents of monetary activism warned that the aggressive expansion of central bank balance sheets portended inflation, and that purchases of mortgage-backed securities by the Federal Reserve and of sovereign bonds by the ECB delayed the necessary consolidation of private and public finances. By keeping interest rates low, they limited the pressure on households and governments to tighten their belts. The critics mounted strident attacks on central bank policies in the pages of the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere. The classic example was the open letter to Chairman Bernanke in the Journal on November 15, 2010, signed by twenty-three economists, investors, and political strategists, whose money quote read as follows: “We believe the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchase plan (so-called ‘quantitative easing’) should be reconsidered and discontinued. We do not believe such a plan is necessary or advisable under current circumstances. The planned asset purchases risk currency debasement and inflation, and we do not think they will achieve the Fed’s objective of promoting employment.”3 The language in Europe may have differed, but the sentiment was the same.

The worry that central banks were prone to debasing the currency was, to be sure, of long standing. In Europe, it was deeply rooted in 1920s experience. The preoccupation was reinforced now by concern that the monetary authorities were interfering with the operation of the market and, by artificially supporting the economy, weakening the pressure to undertake structural reforms.

Increasingly these arguments reshaped policy, even if the dangers to which they pointed were largely illusory. Inflation remained subdued so long as recovery was incomplete, slack was extensive, and interest rates were near zero. The assumption that structural reform would proceed more quickly if central banks tightened the screws was just that: an assumption.

But, illusory or not, these critiques led central bankers to brood over the negative consequences of their policies. Members of the Federal Open Market Committee were obliged to explain how the Fed would exit from its accommodative policies. Although actual exit remained a matter for the future, talk of exit had a depressing effect. ECB President Mario Draghi was compelled to temper his commitment to “do whatever it takes” to defend the euro with a warning that ECB purchases of government bonds were contingent on pursuit of structural and budgetary reforms.4 But qualifying the point in this way limited the effectiveness of the commitment to do whatever it took. The pressure on central banks was more intense to the extent that the arguments of the critics received official hearing, whether from Ron Paul and his “Audit the Fed” bill in the US House of Representatives or the German Constitutional Court in its readiness to consider the constitutionality of the ECB’s Outright Monetary Transactions. All this helps to explain why central banks hesitated to do more despite the fact that recovery from the recession remained weak.

Thus, after a brief period in 2008–09 when the analogy with the Great Depression was foremost in the minds of policy makers and the priority was to stabilize the economy at all cost, the emphasis shifted. The priority now was to balance budgets. For central banks it was preventing an outbreak of inflation, however chimerical. This shift occurred despite the fact that the recovery continued to disappoint. Rather than avoiding the mistakes of the 1930s, policy makers almost seemed intent on repeating them. Barack Obama’s electoral victory on November 4, 2008, was decisive. His opponent, Arizona Senator John McCain, had not been helped by the crisis. McCain represented continuity with the now-discredited policies of George W. Bush. His understanding of complex financial matters was shaky. At a much-reported White House meeting on September 25, convened at the behest of the McCain camp, Obama demonstrated his grasp of the crisis. The Democratic candidate offered a thoughtful analysis while his Republican opponent sat in stony silence and then offered only vague platitudes about protecting the taxpayer.

What was apparent to participants in the White House meeting was apparent to the public as well. Obama better projected the cool demeanor of a capable crisis manager. He was better able to make sense of the crisis and the case for government action to resolve it. On November 4 he won 365 electoral college votes against McCain’s 173. Although Obama’s victory in 2008 was not as resounding as Roosevelt’s in 1932—FDR received 472 electoral college votes to Hoover’s 59—the Democrats again took control of both houses of Congress.5

The period between election and inauguration was now briefer than in 1932. Support for shortening the interregnum was indeed strengthened by the economic difficulties created by the four-month-long transition from Hoover to Roosevelt, although the effort to amend the Constitution to this effect was already underway. But even though the inauguration was moved from March to January, the awkward interval still lasted ten weeks. In the meantime, the task was to keep the financial system afloat.

Much of the heavy lifting in this period, like others, was done by the Federal Reserve. On November 25, 2008, in response to evidence of distress in securitization markets, the Fed announced it would purchase up to $100 billion of direct obligations of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks and $500 billion of their mortgage-backed securities with the goal of restarting mortgage and housing markets. Purchases of mortgage-backed securities were not, however, something with which Fed staff had experience. The announcement therefore indicated that the central bank would be hiring private fund managers to execute the trades. This inaugurated the first round of what came to be known as quantitative easing.

In a second unprecedented step, the Fed announced creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, for lending to hedge funds and other private investors to finance their purchases of securitized consumer loans. Lending to consumers had turned prohibitively risky. Those loans, moreover, were impossible to finance. Banks customarily bundled them together and sold them to hedge funds, which borrowed much of the money needed for their purchase. Now, however, the money market had seized up, and banks refused to lend. Who knew whether the kind of problems that brought down the market in mortgage-related securities also implicated the market in securitized consumer loans?

The consequences were alarming. If consumers were unable to finance their purchases, they would be unable to spend. Less spending would make for more unemployment, more defaults, and more problems for the financial system.

This was the vicious cycle the Fed now sought to break. Bernanke and Co. announced their readiness to provide up to $180 billion in loans to hedge funds and others purchasing securitized consumer loans. But offering to lend would not be enough if investors, worried by consumer defaults, hesitated to borrow. The Fed therefore promised to forgive its loans were consumers to default in large numbers. Treasury for its part put up $20 billion of TARP money to partially indemnify the central bank against losses.6 This was a clever way of leveraging Treasury’s scarce capital. It testified to Paulson’s mastery of financial engineering in his Goldman Sachs years. The plan’s corresponding shortcoming, as with other financial-engineering schemes, was its complexity. There was the question of which securities would qualify, and how to ensure that the hedge funds would have skin in the game. A solution to the latter problem was found by requiring the hedge funds and others borrowing from the Fed’s new facility to put up additional collateral against their loan. The other difficulties were eventually worked out by the government’s attorneys. But “eventually” turned out to mean after four months, which was how long it took to get the consumer-lending program up and running.

Nothing better illustrates why the Fed’s credit market interventions were so controversial. Lending directly to hedge funds reflected a delayed recognition, following Lehman’s failure, of the importance of the shadow banking system. Better late than never. But guaranteeing those loans fanned fears of moral hazard and complaints that the Fed was extending yet another stealth bailout, this time to hedge funds and the banks with which they did business. And $20 billion of Treasury money did not guarantee that the Fed would escape all losses; it certainly did not let the taxpayer off the hook. Complex maneuvers of the kind the Fed employed to help Treasury lever up its TARP funds were leagues away from conventional monetary policy. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures, but extraordinary measures invite criticism if they defy easy explanation. The motivation for these unconventional policies was, of course, distress in financial markets. And the reality was that the Fed was the only institution with an infinitely expandable balance sheet and the ability to respond quickly.

An additional motivation was that conventional monetary policy was reaching its limits, forcing the Fed to take unconventional steps. The FOMC had already brought its target for the federal funds rate down to 1.5 percent on October 8, 2008, and then to 1 percent on October 29. It flooded financial markets with liquidity. On December 16 the FOMC reduced its target for the Fed funds rate to between zero and 0.25 percent. The policy rate was as low as it could go. The Fed essentially committed to providing however much credit financial markets required, at zero cost.

Doing so was unprecedented in the history of the Federal Reserve System. Only once before, in the wake of September 11, 2001, had the FOMC pushed the Fed funds rate as low as 1 percent. Never had it been pushed lower. Even in the depths of the Great Depression, the discount rate, the 1930s equivalent of the Fed funds target, never fell below 1½ per cent, a level reached only in the New York district in 1931.7 Even then, other Reserve banks, concerned to husband their gold reserves, had hesitated to go along. The current policy of providing unlimited access to Federal Reserve credit at essentially zero cost was very different. It was an indication that officials, their views informed by 1930s experience, were prepared to employ all the monetary power at their disposal to stabilize the financial system and prevent the economy from succumbing to deflation.

Bernanke was concerned that the decision should not be perceived as his policy, or the New York Fed’s policy, as was the case in the 1930s, but rather as the system’s policy. This would prevent the Fed’s confidence-inspiring capacity from being diminished by internal divisions of the sort that raised questions about the commitment of the Federal Reserve in the Depression. In the run-up to the December 16 FOMC decision the chairman therefore worked to form a consensus in favor of the step. Agreement to cut to zero was successfully achieved.

Reaching this consensus allowed Federal Reserve officials to speak with one voice and impress the markets with their resolve to prevent the worst. Doing so was important in order to address the immediate threat of financial collapse. But deciding policy by consensus also prevented the Fed from responding even more aggressively to the continued threat of deflation and, soon, the disappointing pace of recovery. Several Reserve bank presidents had reservations about larger securities purchases, open-ended commitments, and numerical targets for policy, all of which might have helped to support a faster recovery. These reservations were grounded in worries that the Fed would be unable to “take back” the stimulus it had applied with sufficient speed, causing inflation and financial excesses to build up. As in the summer of 2008, a less consensus-oriented chairman might have dismissed their objections out of hand. But not Chairman Bernanke. These initiatives—providing unlimited amounts of credit to the banks, financing purchases of commercial paper through the TALF, and purchasing mortgage-backed securities from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae—all reflected the belief in official circles that the problem was one of liquidity. Trust had dried up. Doubts prompted collateral calls, forcing borrowers to engage in distress sales of assets, in turn requiring more collateral calls. From this diagnosis flowed a prescription: if the authorities stepped in with securities purchases, injecting liquidity into the markets, conditions would normalize.

That the problem was one of liquidity was Paulson’s diagnosis in particular. Asset purchases, recall, were the focus of the TARP as proposed to Congress by the Paulson Treasury at the end of September.8 The notion that the problem was fundamentally one of liquidity resonated with a Treasury secretary exposed to the inner workings of financial markets by his experience at Goldman Sachs. This diagnosis and the policies to which it pointed were politically expedient in that they enabled Treasury to deny that it was providing bailouts to individual financial institutions, plausible deniability being essential in the wake of the AIG rescue if the TARP was to have a snowball’s chance of congressional approval. And it could even be argued that, insofar as the Fed and Treasury made their purchases at fire-sale prices, they might end up turning a profit.

There were just two problems. First, it would take weeks or even months to put in place the apparatus for security purchases. The securities in question were complex and varied, which was of course part of what had gotten investors in those same assets into trouble in the first place. Purchasing them would require Treasury to contract with private fund managers knowledgeable of the market, including some of the same financial institutions involved in originating those securities. Compensation schemes and mechanisms for monitoring fund manager performance would have to be arranged. All this would take time. And time was the one thing even scarcer than liquidity.

Second, there was the reluctant realization—reluctant on Paulson’s part— that the issue was more than just one of liquidity. Banks that made big bets on real-estate-related investments had taken big losses. They now had inadequate capital as a buffer against losses, rendering them unable to borrow and reluctant to lend. Providing them with additional liquidity by purchasing their securities at something resembling current market prices would do little to solve this problem. As a student of the Great Depression, Bernanke could recall how FDR had used the bank holiday to reassure the public that any bank allowed to reopen would be adequately capitalized. Already in September, prior to final passage of the TARP, the Fed chairman was suggesting to Paulson that capital injections might be required to restore confidence and restart bank lending.9

It took ten days following passage of the TARP for Paulson & Co. to acknowledge these facts and agree to use $250 billion of TARP money to recapitalize the banks. On Monday, October 13, Columbus Day, Paulson, Bernanke, New York Fed President Geithner, and Sheila Bair, chair of the FDIC, convened their now-legendary meeting with the CEOs of nine big banks. The officials made clear the importance of those banks present all accepting public capital. If any refused, banks receiving assistance would be singled out as weak links, creating the same problem that had bedeviled the RFC from mid-1932. There was more than a little reluctance on the part of the CEOs and no little chest beating, or so journalistic accounts suggest.10 Geithner and Paulson made clear that CEOs who resisted were unlikely to have their phone calls returned. The terms were not onerous. The banks would be required to pay a dividend of 5 percent, significantly less than if they sought to raise capital on the market—assuming of course that they were able to access the market at all. Goldman Sachs, the bank in the strongest position, had just succeeded in raising $5 billion of capital privately, from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, but paid handsomely for the privilege. It promised Buffett a 10 percent dividend on his shares, fully twice what was now demanded by the government.11 Moreover, the government’s new capital didn’t come with voting rights. Treasury would acquire only nonvoting senior preferred stock, limiting its ability to intervene in future bank operations.12

These provisions were precisely what made this use of TARP funds controversial. Cheap capital smelled of subsidies. Preferred shares without voting rights made the taxpayer a silent partner while the banks called the tune. The government would have no way of compelling banks taking public money to use it for lending to corporations and households desperate for funds.

Finally, this shift in use of TARP funding did not enhance Treasury’s reputation for policy consistency. It encouraged the view that Paulson was still groping for a response. As David Swensen, manager of Yale University’s endowment, put it, policy makers acted “with an extraordinary degree of inconsistency. You almost have to be trying to do things in an incoherent and inconsistent way to have ended up with the huge range of ways that they have come up with to address these problems.”13

Such suspicions were not entirely wide of the mark. Unlike Robert Rubin, the Clinton-era treasury secretary similarly confronted with crises on his watch, Paulson did not have an overarching worldview to guide his decision making. In his memoirs, Rubin describes his particular view of market dynamics and how this led him to adopt what created at least the appearance of a systematic approach to decision making. Rubin kept a sense of personal detachment, whereas Paulson reacted emotionally to events, swinging from one solution to another. The title of his memoirs, On the Brink, almost seems to be referring to his mental state.

As it happened, it would take just days for events to bring the two men together. The occasion would have implications not just for Paulson’s reputation but also for Rubin’s. Paulson continued to assert that diverting $250 billion of TARP funds to recapitalization was a one-off event and that the balance would still be used for asset purchases. He had promised as much when seeking congressional approval for the TARP, making it problematic to change tack now.14 In the event, it took less than a month for the secretary to drop the idea of purchasing toxic assets in its entirety. Market conditions were continuing to worsen, leaving no time for an elaborate purchasing operation. Capital injections promised a bigger bang for the buck.

Not only was there no time for complex financial engineering, but at this point the problem had migrated from the security markets to the banks, the beating heart of the financial system. The banks’ capital shortfall was real. Still, the press struggled to make sense of yet another policy shift. Coverage of Paulson’s November 12 press conference announcing the new strategy was unsympathetic. That Treasury was changing course yet again disconcerted the markets, which dropped by 5 percent.

The implication of the authorities now concentrating on recapitalizing the banks was that regulators knew something that others, as yet, did not. Investors quickly concluded that Citigroup, the largest US bank still standing, was the weak link. Their worries were rooted in awareness that Citi embodied all the worst features of twenty-first-century banking. With a limited deposit base, it relied on wholesale funding. Having pioneered multinational banking as far back as the 1920s, much of the wholesale funding came from skittish foreign investors. It held extensive positions in consumer loans, questionably underwritten commercial real estate, and collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages. It had not turned a profit since the second quarter of 2007, although management continued to pay dividends in an effort to convince investors that the reality was otherwise.

Inchoate fears gave way to panic on November 19, when Citi announced it was forced to wind up a structured investment vehicle heavily invested in subprime-related CDOs. Its stock fell by 23 percent, culminating several months of sharp declines.

But even in this wounded state, Citigroup still had more than $3 trillion of assets, counting those hidden away in its SPVs. If any US bank was too big to fail—if any bank had consciously set out to become too big to fail—this was it. Rubin, now in his capacity as chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup’s board, reminded Paulson of these facts in a series of characteristically “low key” telephone calls.15

The legal niceties that Bernanke, Geithner, and Paulson had cited in connection with the decision to allow Lehman Brothers to go down were set aside in these dire circumstances. Sheila Bair was the one notable dissenter from the decision to go ahead with a bailout. Concerned to husband her agency’s $35 billion insurance fund, Bair proposed putting Citibank, Citigroup’s insured national bank subsidiary, into receivership. Bernanke, Geithner, and Paulson all argued that Citibank was not easily disentangled from the larger financial group of which it was part. Not only was Citigroup larger than Lehman, but it was more international. The kind of problems that arose when Lehman failed and its British regulator froze its accounts would be immensely more disruptive. For all these reasons, Treasury and Fed officials insisted there was no alternative to the rescue cobbled together over the weekend of November 22–23.

In the plan as ultimately structured, the government injected $20 billion of share capital, again taking preferred shares in return. Bernanke suggested common stock, but Paulson demurred. Had it received common stock, the government would have ended up “owning a large part of the bank,” as Paulson subsequently put it, prompting unwelcome headlines about nationalization.16 The government did, in fact, end up owning almost half the bank, given how Citigroup’s market cap fell to little more than $20 billion following announcement of the bailout. The only difference, again, was that its shares did not come with voting rights.

Officials agreed, in addition, to split the losses on $300 billion of Citigroup’s toxic assets. Citi would take the first $29 billion of losses, after which the government would absorb 90 percent, with the TARP, the FDIC, and the Fed taking them in turn. This was another way of leveraging Treasury’s limited funds.17 Providing insurance against losses on mortgage-related investments, moreover, was a less transparent way of providing assistance than injecting more capital or purchasing those assets outright. It was a way to deflect accusations that the authorities were providing another mega-bailout.18

The bailout left a sour taste for those who recalled this bank having been a prime mover in the elimination of Glass-Steagall. Citi was now advised by Rubin, who was also once Paulson’s colleague at Goldman Sachs. Regulatory oversight of the bank was headed up by the New York Fed, whose president, Timothy Geithner, was Rubin’s protégé during the latter’s years in the Clinton Treasury and had just been announced by President-Elect Obama as treasury secretary-designate. The conspiracy theories to which this gave rise were over the top, but the optics did not make rescuing the bank, or subsequently its competitors, any easier.19

The reality that congressional opposition to bailouts without strict conditions, including replacement of top management and retention of voting rights on behalf of taxpayers, had been circumvented with the help of these financial-engineering devices fed skepticism about even more forceful steps to recapitalize the banking system. Still, the mold was cast. It was used again in January when the government bailed out Bank of America. President Bush had hoped to leave this task to the new administration. Congress had not yet agreed to release the second half of the TARP funds, and Bush was reluctant to ask for fear that his last significant act might have to be to veto a congressional bill prohibiting its disbursal. In addition to the embarrassment, this visible sign of disapproval by Congress would not reassure financial markets. But indications that Bank of America would shortly be announcing a $2 billion loss for itself and a $22 billion loss for its newly acquired investment banking division Merrill Lynch threatened to spark another panic. Bush proved more willing to act than Hoover in his last days in office. On January 12, 2009, he requested the second tranche of TARP funds, and Congress reluctantly agreed. Three days later a deal was struck to use the TARP to inject $20 billion of new capital into Bank of America. The government and the bank agreed to split the losses on its $118 billion of mortgage-related assets ninety-ten, following the Citigroup formula, after the first $10 billion of losses, which would go to the bank.

And with this official support in place, Bank of America was able to announce its quarterly results the next morning.
