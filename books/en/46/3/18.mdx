title: Chapter 18 Dip Again
---



It is a commonplace that economic recovery from a financial crisis is slower than recovery from a normal recession. If so, US experience starting in 1933 is an exception. Industrial production doubled between the first half of 1933 and the first half of 1937. Real GDP rose by 50 percent.1 The starting point was low, but recovery at this pace is no less impressive for the fact.

From there, output headed back down. A double-dip recession was of course the last thing America needed. Output in 1937 was still far below late1920s levels. Unemployment was still 14 percent.2 Unless one believes that the damage wrought by the Depression somehow reduced the productive potential of the economy, perhaps by rendering the unemployed unemployable, recovery still had room to run.

It thus took a concerted effort by everyone from FDR on down to produce another recession. The president had again become obsessed with balancing the budget. Large deficits, as he saw it, were a sign that the economy was still ill. Balancing the budget, on the other hand, would signal that the emergency was over. Doing so would give a welcome boost to confidence.

Not for the last time in the annals of economic policy, there was also an element of political expediency involved. Having campaigned in 1932 on a promise to balance the budget, FDR became fixated on the idea with the approach of the 1936 election. It was not so much criticism from the Republican Right that the president feared. Rather, he worried about a challenge from the Left in the person of the radio priest Father Charles Coughlin, who would attack him for failing to crack down on the wealthy and for having been too easy on the bankers. Although Coughlin had supported FDR in 1932, he now turned against him on the grounds that the New Deal was insufficiently ambitious; 分页。。。it marked “two years of surrender, two years of matching the puerile, puny brains of idealists against the virile viciousness of business and finance, two years of economic failure.”3 Coughlin’s own program was a mishmash of conservative and radical ideas, ranging from simplification of government and the tax system to the nationalization of essential industries. The radio priest might not be a serious candidate, but his upstart Union Party still had the capacity to siphon off votes.4

Thus, balancing the budget and populist tax policies could go hand in hand. This political strategy led FDR to push, and the Democrat-controlled Congress to agree to, higher taxes on individuals with incomes above $100,000. A new tax was also levied on undistributed corporate profits, which the wealthy had been using, the president suggested, to shelter income.

These higher taxes were not helpful, but neither are they the entire explanation for the recession that commenced in 1937. The increase in income taxes affected only a fraction of the 1 percent of highest earners. The undistributed profits tax could have depressed investment spending by encouraging firms to pay out dividends rather than using retained earnings to underwrite capital projects. However, the most detailed study of the tax, by Charles Calomiris and Glenn Hubbard, concludes there was little tendency for firms with attractive investment opportunities to forgo them. Numerous investment projects promising high returns had been deferred during the Depression. Companies were now willing to use their retained earnings to finance them, undistributed profits tax or not. The fact that investment was the most strongly growing component of GDP in the second half of 1936 makes it hard to hang the recession on the undistributed profits tax alone.5 More important, surely, was the restrictive turn in monetary policy. The prices of raw materials and primary products had begun moving up with the recovery. Mindful of the experience of the 1920s, the Fed was quick to warn that higher prices might spill over to financial markets and into another wave of financial speculation. Almost as if on command, the Dow Jones industrials began rising in July.

Marriner Eccles, the Utah businessman-banker newly installed as governor of the Federal Reserve Board, was less concerned than many of his colleagues. Introduced to FDR by Rexford Tugwell, whom he had met on an earlier trip east, Eccles was involved in drafting the Banking Act of 1935.6 The act transferred the power to set discount rates and conduct open market operations once and for all from the Reserve banks to the board of governors, and it conferred on the board the power to change reserve requirements for member banks.7 Centralizing the power to set discount rates promised to avoid a replay of the disastrous experience of the 1920s, when Reserve banks failed to coordinate their policies. Empowering the board to alter reserve requirements gave it another instrument with which to influence bank lending.

Transferring power from the regions to Washington, D.C., was anathema to Senator Carter Glass, who had contributed to the original legislation that established the central bank’s decentralized design. But greater centralization was not uncongenial to FDR. More generally, the central bank’s failure to contain the Depression and stem the banking crisis undermined support for Glass’ decentralized design. Glass and his allies, the banker Owen Young among them, opposed the reform as subjecting monetary policy decision making to “political control.” But political control was no longer patently undesirable, given the manifest incompetence of apolitical decision making.

The Banking Act sailed through Congress, and FDR was quick to draw the logical conclusion and appoint Eccles, his personal monetary reformer, to head the reorganized Fed.8 Eccles claimed no association with Wall Street, which worked in his favor. His straightforward manner and background as the grandson of a blind covered-wagon pioneer gave him the benefit of the doubt. That he had managed a chain of twenty-eight family banks across three states and virtually invented the chain banking model, which caused so much trouble in other contexts, was conveniently overlooked, as was the fact that his construction company was heavily involved in the public works project later known as Hoover Dam. Eccles is sometimes said to have been the model for the George Bailey character in It’s a Wonderful Life. In his autobiography he describes how, faced with a bank run, he mounted the counter of the First National Bank in Ogden in 1931 to reassure anxious depositors that the bank had adequate cash.9

But installed in his new position, Eccles found to his chagrin that his powers were ineffectual. The now higher dollar price of gold, in conjunction with unsettled conditions in Europe, caused foreign funds to flow toward the United States, where they piled up in the banks. Swimming in cash, banks had no need to borrow from the Fed. As a result, changes in the discount rate, the instrument on which the Federal Reserve relied to fine-tune financial conditions, had no impact on bank behavior.

The decision by the Federal Reserve Board under Eccles to raise reserve requirements from 13 to 19.5 percent in August 1936, 22.5 percent in March 1937, and 26 percent in May was intended to restore the effectiveness of the central bank’s conventional policy tools. It was a way for the Fed to reassert its control of financial conditions.10 But Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz argue that these higher reserve requirements were the blunt instrument that caused the 1937–38 recession.11 Bank lending peaked in the first half of 1937, they observe, coincident with the second increase in required reserves and immediately prior to the downturn in industrial production. The increase in reserve requirements must have been the cause.

Modern scholarship has not been kind to their argument. Thomas Cargill and Thomas Mayer compare the response of member banks with that of banks that were not members of the Federal Reserve System and were not subject to the higher reserve requirements. Any differences in subsequent lending behavior were too small, they find, to have contributed significantly to the 1937–38 recession.12 Charles Calomiris, Joseph Mason, and David Wheelock, focusing exclusively on Federal Reserve member banks, similarly find that the increase in reserve requirements had little impact on bank behavior.13 These conclusions are consistent with the views of Eccles himself, who believed the increase in reserve requirements had little impact on the current state of the economy but was intended only to restore the effectiveness of the Fed’s policy instruments for future use.14 Thus, if a slowdown in bank lending precipitated the recession, it must have had other sources.

Treasury Secretary Morgenthau was among those preoccupied by the specter of inflation. Morgenthau had no formal training in economics and little experience in business, as his public appearances and cabinet interventions betrayed. He owed his cabinet post to his personal relationship with FDR, his Dutchess County neighbor, and to the untimely death of his predecessor, William Woodin. But this did not now deter him; inflation was an easy enough problem to understand. Benjamin Strong’s policies between 1924 and 1928 had allowed excessive amounts of credit to build up in the banking and financial system, ultimately with destabilizing consequences. Or so was the historical recollection of Morgenthau and his circle.

And if excessive money and credit was a threat, Treasury had the upper hand when seeking to address it. Starting in December 1936, the Morgenthau Treasury sought to address this supposed inflationary threat by neutralizing the impact of gold inflows on credit markets. Every ounce of gold that flowed into the country from abroad could still be sold to the Treasury for $35, in principle adding that much more currency and credit to existing supplies and stoking inflation. To neutralize the inflationary threat, the Treasury Department now sold bonds from its portfolio in the same amount, mopping up the additional cash and removing it from circulation.15

Several pieces of evidence point to the importance of these operations for the 1937–38 recession. First, the nine months separating their initiation from the downturn is about the amount of time normally required for a monetary shock to be transmitted to the economy. Second, these Treasury operations depressed the money supply by roughly 10 percent, a large amount.16 Finally, unlike the increase in reserve requirements, Treasury operations can also account for the timing of the recovery. Treasury ended its policy of neutralizing the impact of gold inflows on the economy in February 1938, in response to evidence that a recession was underway. In April it then began reversing earlier operations.17 As expected, this imparted a sharp positive shock to the money supply and bank lending.

Activity bottomed out in June 1938, and the economy began to recover. Where the post-1929 downturn continued for nearly four years, this one lasted just one. The difference reflected the speed with which monetary conditions were relaxed. It is hard to imagine a more convincing demonstration of the power of policy.

This historical experience was widely cited as a cautionary tale by those who worried, starting in 2009, that the Fed might prematurely abandon its accommodative monetary stance.18 They invoked the episode to warn that an economy only starting to recover from a financial crisis could require an extended period of monetary support. This historical instance when monetary policy had turned restrictive even while output remained as much as 15 percent below potential was part of what prompted the Bernanke Fed to maintain a relatively accommodative stance for the better part of six years. Another popular explanation for the 1937–38 slump is the president’s hostility to business. Kansas Governor Alf Landon, the Republican candidate, emphasized this when opposing Roosevelt in the 1936 presidential campaign. FDR in turn made much of business’s opposition to his candidacy, disparaging his business critics as “economic royalists.”19

In a study that attracted considerable attention following the 2008–09 crisis, Robert Higgs argued that government interference with the economy and uncertainty about regulation were responsible for the 1937–38 double dip.20 The Social Security Act, the National Labor Relations Act, and the Banking Act all were passed over business opposition. Rapid-fire changes in antitrust law, labor law, securities law, and tax law—rapid-fire changes being the hallmark of the New Deal—unsettled business owners. Businessmen polled by the American Institute of Public Opinion overwhelmingly blamed uncertainty and the president’s hostility to business for impeding the recovery.21

The main evidence Higgs adduces in favor of his uncertainty hypothesis is that the share of construction in private investment was lower in 1935–36 than in the second half of the 1920s. Construction is the form of investment most likely to be discouraged by uncertainty, since construction projects take time. But a considerable proportion of construction in the 1920s was of residential and commercial real estate, as we saw in Chapter 1. It is hard to see why the construction of homes and offices a decade earlier should be taken as a metric for the adequacy of investment in industrial plant and equipment in the 1930s. The principal legacy of that earlier real estate boom now was an overhang of unoccupied commercial properties. Entire floors of the Empire State Building, which real estate professionals referred to disparagingly as the “Empty State Building,” remained unoccupied in the 1930s. Then there were the glut of residential property and the mortgage crisis, which the HOLC went only partway to resolve.

Higgs’ other evidence is the difference between interest rates on shortand long-term corporate bonds. Rates on short-term corporate bonds rose starting in 1934, but long-term rates rose even faster. Higgs ascribes the disproportionate increase in long-term rates to uncertainty about the economic future. “Investors’ confidence in their ability to appropriate the longer-term interest payments and principal repayments promised by the country’s most secure corporations plummeted between early 1934 and early 1936,” he writes.22 Anxious bondholders, responding to this uncertainty, demanded an additional premium in order to hold long-term claims on those corporations.

But rates on long-term government bonds also rose relative to those on the government’s short-term obligations, and no one seriously doubted the government’s commitment to servicing its debt. The explanation for these sympathetic movements is simple. Roosevelt had pushed up the price of gold, leading investors to anticipate inflation rather than deflation. With the economy poised to recover, they expected the demand for credit to recover with it. More demand for credit would mean higher interest rates. Higher expected future interest rates thus pushed up long rates starting in 1934. This in fact is the standard behavior of interest rates in recoveries.23 It is similarly standard for the gap between long-term and short-term interest rates to narrow with the approach of a recession—which is what happened in 1937. If one insists on a supply-side explanation for the 1937–38 recession, then one must look to the labor market. The administration had sought to raise wages and prices as part of its fight against deflation. As we have seen, it was even more successful in pushing up wages, which perversely raised labor costs and discouraged hiring at a time of 25 percent unemployment. The National Labor Relations Act, signed into law in 1935, then encouraged unionization by prohibiting discrimination against workers who belonged to a labor organization and requiring employers to bargain collectively with the workers’ designated representative. So fortified, union membership doubled in two years.24 Workers quickly sought to determine how far they could push their new labor rights. The big three automobile firms, with their elaborate supply chains, were the obvious place to push. By disrupting production at a plant that was the sole source of a component, an isolated strike could shut down an entire firm. Sit-down strikes began at the Firestone and Goodyear Tire and Rubber Com­ panies in Akron, Ohio, in early 1936. Following Roosevelt’s landslide victory, they spread to General Motors’ Fisher Body No. 1 in Flint, Michigan, which housed one of only two sets of dies used to produce the bodies of GM’s 1937 model cars. (The plant was a descendant of the Fisher Body Corporation, which features in the story of Carl Fisher and Florida real estate in Chapter 1.) GM’s weekly output fell from more than fifty thousand units in December 1936 to just fifteen hundred two months later, leaving the company no choice but to quickly reach an agreement with the United Auto Workers. Chrysler followed in weeks. Only Henry Ford, a sworn enemy of unionization, held out until 1941, but even the Ford Motor Company granted generous wage increases to keep the unions out.

Average hourly earnings in the auto industry rose by more than 20 percent between October 1936 and July 1937. For the moment, the auto companies left their prices unchanged, but everyone knew that the cost increase would mean higher prices with the arrival of the new model year in the second half of 1937; the auto companies’ advertising anticipated as much. Consumers considering a new car were thus encouraged to purchase it before the price increases hit. As Joshua Hausman shows, sales were far above expectations in the first half of 1937 and then sharply lower in the second half. The timing coincides almost exactly with that of the recession.25

The question is whether the Roosevelt Administration was responsible for this eruption of worker militancy. In fact, FDR was no more than a lukewarm supporter of the Wagner Act, whose true champion was New York Senator Robert Wagner, a longtime advocate of labor rights. In any case, more than just legislation was at work. It is not surprising that, having taken wage cuts of as much as 50 percent since the start of the Depression, workers at GM and other auto firms went after increases when the demand for their products began to recover. As in 1929, the slump had negative repercussions abroad. Although international trade and financial linkages had loosened since the 1920s, the US economy was still too important for it to be otherwise. Imports of manufactured and semi-manufactured goods fell off with the double dip. Raw material prices had risen with recovery, benefiting long-suffering Latin American exporters. They now reversed direction, not just in the United States but globally. Still, the downturn in the rest of the world was short and shallow compared with 1929–1931. When exports to the United States tailed off, central banks and governments were no longer compelled to raise interest rates to prevent their exchange rates from weakening. They were now free to cut interest rates in order to encourage additional domestic spending to substitute for the US spending that was lost.

But getting to this point was not easy. Well into 1936, a hard core of European countries still clung, perversely, to the gold standard of prior years. In France, Belgium, Italy, and Poland there was a reluctance to open the door to the kind of interest-group infighting that spawned deficits and inflation in the 1920s. There was fear that Anglo-Saxon speculators would destabilize exchange rates and currencies, as they allegedly had a decade earlier. For the Netherlands and Switzerland, clinging to the gold standard was important for cementing the position of Amsterdam and Zurich as financial centers. For Poland, allying monetarily with France was a way of building financial defenses against Germany.

The political reaction against austerity then pulled the plug on this rump gold bloc. France, recall, had run budget deficits for much of the 1920s. When deficits then returned with the collapse of tax revenues in 1931, they brought with them the threat of renewed inflation and crisis, or so French leaders warned. Balancing the budget thus came to be seen as essential for maintaining confidence, fostering investment, and reviving growth. Although some French governments, like the right-wing coalition headed by Pierre Laval, pursued policies of austerity almost gleefully, others like the left-wing coalition led by Édouard Herriot did so reluctantly. Herriot, besides having been the victim of the 1925 Bank of France scandal, was known for being kind-hearted, which was probably a factor in his choice as prime minister again in 1932. But even Herriot was intimidated by the imminent arrival of the bond-market vigilantes.

Nor was it permissible to contemplate abandoning the gold standard. Expert French commentators were aware that cheap money had helped to stabilize the British and US economies, but they warned recovery induced in this way was temporary and unsustainable. Anesthetized from the pain of the Depression, speculators would be quick to resume the kind of reckless behavior that culminated in the 1929 crash.

One of the few to question whether austerity was the route to prosperity was Paul Reynaud, the Sorbonne-trained lawyer, amateur statistician, and early-1930s finance minister who represented a Parisian electoral district encompassing the Bank of France in the Chamber of Deputies. That Reynaud came from the Center-Right made his apostasy particularly compelling. But Reynaud understood more clearly than most of his parliamentary colleagues that deflation and devaluation were the only available alternatives; there was no other way of squaring the circle. This contrasts with the members of the Socialist Party, whose slogan was the hopelessly unrealistic “Neither deflation nor devaluation.”

Reynaud, as a Rightist, preferred deflation. In 1934 he attacked the Conservative National Unity government of Gaston Doumergue and the Radical-led government of Edouard Daladier alike for not implementing more draconian fiscal cuts in the effort to push down wages and costs.26 But the failure of his increasingly pointed attacks to produce results and the reluctance of successive French governments, notwithstanding their very different political colorations, to pursue deflation more vigorously, especially if this meant antagonizing shopkeepers, public servants, and farmers, led Reynaud to conclude that regaining competitiveness through deflation was infeasible in practice.

What was unique about Reynaud was not his appreciation of the difficulty of deflation but rather his ability to recognize the implication. If deflation was infeasible, then devaluation—abandoning the gold standard—was the necessary alternative. Reynaud was no devaluationist, but he had the intellectual flexibility to change his position when, as Keynes would have said, the facts change. He was among the few able to distinguish the effects of currency depreciation in the 1920s, when demand exceeded supply and inflation resulted, from the effects of currency depreciation now, when deficient demand was the problem.

But Reynaud’s style as a renegade—he adopted similarly unconventional positions on diplomatic and military issues—did not endear him to his colleagues. Nor did his temperament. Reynaud was the smartest person in the room, and he knew it. The more his parliamentary colleagues resisted, the more strident, sarcastic, and ineffective his interventions became.27

This summary might almost be dismissed as a caricature of the parallels between prevailing views in 1930s France and the policy dogmas of the twenty-first-century Eurozone were it not in fact an entirely accurate portrait of contemporary French opinion. Defense of the gold standard was seen as a moral imperative. Jean Tannery, newly installed governor of the Bank of France in 1935, spoke of it as “not solely a national necessity” but “a duty of far wider scope.” The choice was “between certainty and illusion, thrift and speculation, productive work and the profit of the moment.”28 The same moralizing that underlay the commitment to austerity in post-2009 Europe rings through in Tannery’s words. It is not entirely obvious why blind faith in the gold standard endured for so much longer in France than in Britain or the United States. Initially French leaders could invoke what seemed like the country’s genetic immunity to the Depression. Stabilization of the franc came late, and the extended period of turbulence that preceded it bequeathed a backlog of investment projects whose exploitation kept growth going for a time. The undervalued franc gave French industry a leg up and helped the country accumulate a war chest of gold. This allowed the Bank of France a margin of error. It allowed toleration of gold losses rather than forcing it to raise interest rates when outflows accelerated after 1933.29

And even when France felt the brunt of the Great Depression, the rise in unemployment was limited. France was more heavily agricultural than Britain and Germany. Workers who had recently moved to the cities retained connections in the countryside and returned to their villages when manufacturing employment turned down. The result was subsistence rather than prosperity, but subsistence was better than nothing.30 This de facto safety net limited the political reaction against the policies responsible for the Depression. The result was not unlike Japan in the 1990s, which experienced a growth collapse and deflationary crisis; but the rise in unemployment was similarly limited due to early retirement, work sharing, and political pressure on large employers, and the political reaction was also surprisingly mild.

This is the only way of understanding why the French public continued to tolerate, for as long as it did, the policies of Pierre Laval, who returned for a second term as prime minister in 1935. Laval came from a modest background as the youngest child of a café proprietor and butcher in a village in the Auvergne, although he was a consummate political operator and, by this time, a wealthy man. Starting political life as a Socialist, he made his name as an attorney defending strikers, trade unionists, and left-wing agitators. He was asked in 1911 to stand, unsuccessfully, as Socialist candidate for the Chamber of Deputies in the Neuilly-Boulogne constituency of Paris, before winning a parliamentary seat in 1914 on a second try. In and out of office through the 1920s, Laval made his fortune from investments in two provincial newspapers, Le Moniteur de Puy-de-Dôme and the Lyon Républicain, and in the pioneering Radio-Lyon, acquisitions he financed with the help of banks and an investment trust that apparently appreciated the synergies between politics and media.

With wealth, Laval moved to the Center and then to the Right. In 1931, after the government of André Tardieu was brought down by the Oustric banking scandal, Laval was asked to head a new Center-Right government. This was the government that blocked an emergency loan to Austria during the Creditanstalt crisis and then came to loggerheads with the Hoover administration over reparations. Laval’s was not an overwhelmingly positive record, and his government fell over a confidence vote in February 1932. That Time magazine chose him as its “Man of the Year” for 1931 reflected more his disarming man-of-the people image, on display during his US trip, than any positive achievement.

The most noteworthy aspect of Laval’s year as head of government was the opportunity it afforded him for a tête-à-tête with Heinrich Brüning. His visit to Berlin in September 1931 was the first official visit to the German capital in half a century by a French statesman of comparable stature. Its main effect appears to have been to give Laval an appreciation of Brüning’s approach to economic management.

By early 1935 the French Depression was fully underway. Investors increasingly feared that the franc would go the way of sterling, the dollar, and, closer to home, the Belgian franc. The Bank of France lost more than 10 percent of its gold reserves in May 1935 alone. The conservative government of Pierre-Etienne Flandin fell owing to its inability to restore confidence, and in June Laval was returned to power.

Laval now demanded Brüning-like powers of decree to cut the salaries and pensions of civil servants and veterans. He at least attempted to put a more sympathetic face on those policies; taking a leaf from FDR’s book, he explained them in a fireside chat.31 Seeking to capitalize on his image as a humble peasant, Laval used straightforward language and a homespun manner to convey his simple message: like a household in straitened times, the French state needed to tighten its belt, and balancing the budget would entail painful sacrifices all around. Laval’s decree laws reduced central and local government expenditures by 10 percent and cut the wages and salaries of public employees by the same amount. Although these sacrifices were painful, there was no alternative. “You don’t have to be an expert or a financier,” Laval explained in man-of-the-people terms, “to realize that if you want to spend more than you have, you soon end up bankrupt. What is true for individuals,” he intoned, invoking classic pre-Keynesian logic, “is also true of the national community.”32

The predictable result was protest on the Left, which was convinced that Laval’s emphasis on expenditure cuts favored the rich. The Communists and Socialists issued a joint manifesto denouncing Laval’s “decrees of misery.” In an echo of the Invergordon “mutiny,” when British sailors threatened with pay cuts failed to fall in for duty, clashes broke out between workers at naval arsenals in Brest and Toulon and the municipal police. Conservative alarm over this left-wing agitation bolstered support for the proto-fascist organization of veterans known as the Croix de Feu (“Cross of Fire”). In response Laval, like Brüning before him, doubled down with a second set of decrees. Issued in August, they combined spending cuts with a cosmetic public-works program designed to sway public opinion. Here there again was inadvertent homage to FDR, who had combined budget balancing with measures to limit the increase in the cost of living and obeisance to the idea of stimulating the economy. This is the best one can do in attempting to put a coherent face on Laval’s flurry of edicts.

That Parliament was in recess for the remainder of the summer allowed the government to survive into the fall. A third set of austerity measures followed on October 31, the day Laval’s decree powers expired. The only thing that kept him in office was the reluctance of the Radicals, the moderate left-of-center party, to support the Socialist-Communist alternative, which they feared would mean devaluation. By early 1936, even the French public had had enough. The Radicals, the Socialists, and the Communists formed a Popular Front for the April and May legislative elections.33 The result was increased support for the Popular Front, but also for Far Right parties. With the Left commanding a small majority, the Radicals and Socialists, with support from the Communists, duly formed a government headed by Léon Blum.

Blum was the antithesis of Laval, electorates in this period tending to replace failed leaders with their temperamental and political opposites. Born in Paris, not the provinces, to a well-to-do family, Blum attended the prestigious École Normale Supérieure, whereas Laval had spent just a year studying in Lyon. Unlike Laval, who gravitated to the right, Blum remained a Socialist for life. Where Laval went on to collaborate with the Nazis and was tried and executed as a traitor, Blum opposed granting full powers to Marshall Pétain, leading to his arrest and imprisonment in Buchenwald and Dachau.

Blum campaigned in 1936 on a platform that included an end to public spending cuts, a commitment to large-scale public works, and radical reform of the Bank of France.34 But even he ruled out devaluation as a bridge too far. Like FDR in 1932, Blum insisted that, though he would stabilize the economy by pushing up incomes and encouraging spending, he would not devalue. There would be “no monetary coup d’état,” he reassured an anxious Chamber of Deputies.35

But just how the new premier proposed to square the circle was unclear. Not a few commentators suspected, as they had of Roosevelt, that Blum had determined to devalue before the election. It seems more likely that Blum, like Roosevelt, was uncertain about how to proceed. When the new government removed Jean Tannery as governor of the Bank of France for his association with deflation, it replaced him not with Pierre Quesnay, a deputy director known to favor devaluation, but with Émile Labeyrie, whose views on the subject were obscure.

After years of falling incomes, French autoworkers, like US autoworkers in 1936, were quick to attempt to collect the higher wages and easier conditions they were promised in the campaign. The initial sit-down strikes erupted when workers at Berliot, a manufacturer of cars, trucks, and buses, celebrated May Day by taking the day off and were fired in response. Strikes then spread to La Havre, where metalworkers in the aviation industry sat down on May 11. From there they spread to the metalworking factories of Paris, to Renault, and to the rest of the economy. The strikers succeeded in shutting not just factories but also bars and bakeries and, indeed, virtually the entire economy, aside from essential police and administrative services.

This was the situation confronting the new government on taking office in June. It responded with the Matignon agreements, named after the Hotel Matignon, the residence of the prime minister. The accord was negotiated between the unions and the employers’ confederation, with the government as mediator, rather than legislated as in the United States, but the inspiration from the New Deal was clear. The Matignon agreements recognized the right to strike. They offered a 15 percent rise in private-sector pay. They granted a two-week annual holiday and a forty-hour workweek.

But their main effect, like that of the NIRA, was to raise production costs. Industrial production fell back starting in June, and unemployment began rising immediately. Sharply higher costs and prices depressed exports, leading to gold losses in August.

Blum didn’t want to devalue, but he didn’t know what else to do. It didn’t help that his finance minister, Vincent Auriol, the Socialist party spokesman for financial issues, failed to offer a constructive alternative. Auriol’s strategy for reconciling reflation with the gold standard was to predict the imminent return of confidence and, at the same time, to threaten currency speculators with capital controls. These were not exactly compatible—or confidence inspiring—policies.

Further deflation having been ruled out by the election, the only alternatives now remaining were devaluation and exchange control. Labeyrie and others joined Auriol in blaming the speculators and pushed for controls. In the end, Blum chose to follow the Americans rather than the Nazis; alliance politics as much as Socialist economic views carried the day.36 The gold standard was abandoned on September 25. To save face, Auriol attempted to dress up the event as a “monetary adjustment” rather than devaluation. About the true nature of the adjustment, however, there was no question. The franc dropped by 25 percent on the news. An exchange equalization fund like that established in the British Treasury was quickly created to manage the floating franc and keep it in a range between 25 and 35 percent below its earlier gold standard levels. On the Saturday following announcement of the French devaluation, it took only a few hours for the Swiss National Bank to be overwhelmed by requests to convert francs into gold and for the Federal Council to acknowledge reality: “Switzerland Regretful” was how the New York Times headlined the news. Regret was not, however, the dominant emotion of investors. Swiss government bonds rose by 7 percent, Swiss railway bonds by 10 percent, on the first trading day following the weekend.

The pressure shifted next to Amsterdam; it took just hours for the Dutch government to throw in the towel. At this point the only country still on the gold standard at an unchanged parity was Albania, which continued to receive large loans from its political patron in Rome.37 The Albanian nation would pay a high price for this financial support when it was occupied and forced into political union with Italy in 1939.

For the countries that now regained their monetary autonomy—or, more accurately, had monetary autonomy thrust on them—the question was how the public would react. In Holland, where workers and employers were well organized along religious as well as economic lines, it was straightforward to bring the social partners together and reach an agreement to trade wage restraint for investment. Prices now rose with depreciation, but costs did not follow. The result was a sharp increase in profitability; share prices rose by nearly 60 percent over the succeeding year. Industrial production was 37 percent higher in the first five months of 1937 than in the comparable period the year before. Rather than undermining confidence and exciting capital outflows, as the advocates of “rigor” had warned, depreciation prompted the repatriation of flight capital, making funds more freely available to industry and stimulating investment.

The Swiss case was similar. Depreciation of the Swiss franc brought about a sharp increase in export competitiveness. The improved profitability of export-oriented firms boosted share prices and investment. Deposits at Swiss banks rose in the wake of devaluation, contrary to the expectations of those who had argued that abandoning the gold standard would destroy Switzerland’s status as a safe haven and financial center.

In each case currency depreciation removed the pressure for internal devaluation. It limited the need to reduce wages and costs, firm by firm and industry by industry. Export prices could be pushed up at a stroke. The Netherlands and Switzerland being small countries with institutions of social solidarity that could be used to restrain pressure for increases in wages and public expenditure, it was possible to prevent costs from following.

France, on the other hand, was a large country polarized by five years of deflation. Those who suffered most, members of the working class, now demanded recompense, making it impossible to restrain wages. The budgetary discipline of earlier years having been discredited, little could be done to limit the growth of public spending.

And where the Dutch and Swiss governments could blame devaluation on events beyond their control—they could point the finger at Paris—in France devaluation reflected the contradictions of the government’s own policies. Blum’s earlier insistence that the franc would not be devalued did not make the medicine go down easier or enhance the credibility of his promises. The right time to devalue would have been June, on taking office, in the manner of Takahashi. Blame for gold losses and problems of inadequate competitiveness could then have been laid on the doorstep of the previous government.

Instead, Blum vacillated. As a result, when devaluation finally came it did little to revitalize the French economy. Initially, some of the financial capital that had fled the country over the summer flowed back in, buoying the Paris Bourse. But the depreciation of the franc was smaller than the depreciation of sterling in 1931 and of the dollar in 1933. The US and UK could threaten to push their currencies down further if the French were too aggressive, forcing the Blum government to negotiate an agreement promising to limit franc depreciation. Together with the increase in costs, this meant there was little improvement in competitiveness.

By November, capital was once more flowing out, and industrial production was heading back down. Having condemned Laval’s earlier use of decree powers, Blum now demanded them for himself. When the Senate denied his request, he resigned. For France, devaluation was an opportunity lost.
