title: Chapter 15 Revival or Reform
---



Franklin delano roosevelt was inaugurated as thirty-second president of the United States on a cold and blustery March 4. The extraordinary circumstances were signified by the presence of automatic-weapon emplacements along the route from the White House to Capitol Hill. It had been three weeks since Roosevelt was the target of an assassination attempt by an unemployed bricklayer in which five bystanders were wounded, including one, Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak, critically. The president-elect was addressing a gathering at Bayfront Park in Miami following a cruise on Vincent Astor’s yacht. Cermak was there to apologize for having opposed him at the nominating convention and to lobby for RFC assistance for Chicago’s banks. In his confession, the gunman, Giuseppe Zangara, explained, “I kill kings and presidents first, and next all capitalists.”1

But the placement of the machine-gun nests at the entry of federal buildings indicated they were designed to guard not so much the new president as government property, against occupation by the unemployed masses. The events of 1932 had created grounds for concern, if not necessarily for expecting attacks on federal buildings on inauguration day. Working-class demonstrators, some organized by communist-inspired Unemployed Councils, demanded relief services and a stay on evictions. Mayor Cermak had been forced to rescind cutbacks in city relief programs in response.2 In December some three thousand unemployed had caravanned to Washington, D.C., for a National Hunger March down Pennsylvania Avenue.

Economic conditions deteriorated further in the months between the election and inauguration. By March 4, banks in thirty-seven states were shut or under state-government-imposed restrictions on withdrawals.3 With panicked 分页。。。households unwilling to spend and producers unable to borrow, industrial production fell to just two-thirds the 1925–1929 average. Freight car loadings were down 56 percent. Automobile production was barely a quarter of its 1929 level. At 2:30 a.m. on the morning of the inauguration, Herbert Lehman, who had succeeded Roosevelt as governor, closed New York’s banks. The Stock Exchange shut its doors for only the third time in history, the previous occasions having been in 1873, due to an earlier financial panic, and with the outbreak of World War I. This, one might say, was Wall Street’s first Lehman moment. Such was the situation confronting the new president. There was, of course, the criticism, levied by President Hoover among others, that FDR had brought this dire situation on himself. Hoover had reached out to his successor for help in stabilizing the banking system. Roosevelt’s refusal to cooperate robbed the incumbent president, down to his last days in office, of remaining legitimacy, or at least of the will to act.

In particular, Hoover believed that Roosevelt’s reluctance to endorse the gold standard inflamed the crisis of confidence. Subsequent events do not support this view. FDR took six additional weeks to clarify his position on the gold standard but only days to restore confidence in the banks. Still, Hoover was convinced of the need to remove this source of uncertainty. He therefore sought to lock the president-elect into a pro-gold-standard position.4 FDR refused to be pinned down. He may not have yet decided against maintenance of the gold standard, but he wanted to keep his options open.

In addition, FDR and his Brains Trust were aware that they would have had to negotiate the terms of any bank holiday with Hoover and his appointees. And prior to March 4, they would not have had powers of office with which to back their views. The more Machiavellian interpretation is that the worse the situation was on March 4, the more problems could be blamed on Hoover, and the more positive would be the reception of his successor’s initiatives.

In his inaugural address, Roosevelt sought to communicate that the day marked the dawn of not just a new administration but also a new era of hope and action. But just what form that action would take was uncertain, in part because it was not obvious who had the president’s ear. On the economy, Roosevelt consulted three distinct groups of advisors.5 The first was a team of progressives led by the Harvard law professor Felix Frankfurter, who had cultivated FDR almost from the moment he appeared on the national stage. Their relationship went back to World War I, when Roosevelt was assistant secretary of the navy and Frankfurter chaired the War Labor Policies Board. Frankfurter and his students were proponents of an economic and political philosophy developed by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis. Brandeis was concerned to limit the concentrated economic and political power of the robber barons, a problem that gained salience with the development of the assembly line and growth of industrial monoliths like Ford and General Motors.6 The Brandeisians denied that big firms had efficiency advantages, something they were free to do since they were lawyers rather than economists. Nostalgic for an idealized past of small family firms, the urban equivalent of Jeffersonian democracy, they now sought to restore it by regulating large enterprises.

The Brandeisians were more concerned with reform than recovery and saw the Depression as an opportunity to advance their agenda. Thus, not a few of the regulatory burdens imposed on industry by the New Deal, of which business so vociferously complained, were the products of the febrile minds of Frankfurter and his circle.7 In December 1933 the English economist John Maynard Keynes published an open letter in which he criticized the Roosevelt administration for emphasizing reform over recovery. Whether he knew it or not, Keynes was really criticizing the Brandeisians and FDR for lending them his ear.8

A second group of advisors was made up of professors at Columbia University, including the institutional economist Rexford Tugwell, the corporate law specialist Adolph Berle, and the political scientist Raymond Moley. Founding members of the Brains Trust, they had advised FDR during the campaign. In contrast to Frankfurter’s circle, they accepted the inevitability of big business but sought to counter it with big government.9 More generally, members of this group espoused an expanded role for government in organizing activity, given their conclusion, entirely logical under the circumstances, that the market could not be relied on to do so.

More moderate members of the Brains Trust, believing that the market had broken down only temporarily, therefore called for an expanded role for the government at most on a transitory basis. Some like Tugwell, however, saw the breakdown as symptomatic of deeper problems and justifying a permanent role for government in planning the economy. Again, given the depth of the Depression and extent of dislocations, this conclusion was not illogical. In their view, the urgency of initiating economic recovery combined with the call for far-reaching structural reform to prompt proposals for regulating wages and prices and reducing acreage under cultivation. The National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) and the Agricultural Adjustment Act were in large part inventions of this second set of advisors.

A third group was made up of inflationists, led by Cornell University agricultural economist George Warren, with support from gentleman farmer and Roosevelt neighbor Henry Morgenthau. Morgenthau was once the publisher of American Agriculturalist magazine; his farm specialized in growing Christmas trees. He became treasury secretary when the president’s initial designee, William H. Woodin, was forced to resign for health reasons.10 In 1929, on becoming governor of New York, FDR created an Agricultural Advisory Commission to advise on farm problems, with Morgenthau as chairman and Warren among its members. As specialists in a sector that saw excess supply already in the 1920s and the prices of whose products fell fastest between 1929 and 1933, Warren and his circle sought to apply the lessons they drew from the farm sector to the economy as a whole. They saw pushing up prices and wages as relieving crushing debt burdens. If abandoning the gold standard was necessary in order to achieve this, then so be it.

Warren’s agrocentric views were lent a veneer of respectability by Yale University monetary economists James Harvey Rogers and Irving Fisher. Rogers was an expert on the gold standard and could speak with authority on its deflationary effects. Fisher was precluded from formally advising Roosevelt by his notorious “permanently high plateau” remark, made of the stock market in 1929, not to mention his advocacy of eugenics and support for Prohibition. But his 1933 article on debt deflation, in which he argued that falling wages and incomes could further damage the economy by making existing debts harder to repay, lent intellectual heft to Warren’s case for inflation.11 The first order of business was resolving the banking crisis. The Brandeisians then, like progressive economists Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz more recently, favored nationalizing the banks.12 So did progressive senators Bronson Cutting of New Mexico and Robert La Follette, Jr., of Wisconsin. But like Barack Obama in 2009, Roosevelt hesitated. Seizing scores of banks and replacing their management with government administrators would take time, which was in short supply. Injecting public money would have been problematic for a president committed to balancing the budget. At a personal level, FDR socialized with prominent investors and financiers like Vincent Astor; Thomas Lamont, the J. P. Morgan partner, had rented Roosevelt’s 12th Street townhouse years before. Notwithstanding his populist rhetoric about banishing the money changers from their “high seats in the temple of our civilization,” the new president preferred to work with the bankers rather than against them.13

Consequently, Roosevelt’s approach to resolving the banking crisis did not differ materially from Hoover’s. Already on the Friday night before the inauguration, outgoing Treasury Secretary Mills met with Professor Moley and Treasury Secretary-designate Woodin.14 With no set ideas of their own, and having promised the president-elect a bank rehabilitation plan within days, Moley and Woodin simply adopted the plan of their predecessors. The New Deal may have been famously experimental, but there was no experimentation here.

On Sunday, March 5, his first full day in office, FDR invoked the Trading with the Enemy Act to suspend gold transactions and declare a four-day bank holiday, an expedient that would have an echo in Gordon Brown’s invoking the UK Anti-Terrorism Act in 2008. This too had been considered by Hoover; the outgoing president even recommended that FDR invoke the Trading with the Enemy Act at a White House meeting on March 3.15

Roosevelt next summoned the Congress into emergency session, giving his team three days to finalize their plans. Although the Emergency Banking Act submitted for consideration by the House and Senate—read to the House actually, only one copy being available—was scarcely longer than the three-page memorandum submitted by the Paulson Treasury in September 2008, its reception was different.16 The House approved the bill by voice vote after just forty minutes and no opportunity for amendment. The Senate passed it three hours later, by an overwhelming 73 to 7. The president signed the bill the same night.

Title I of the act gave legal status to the bank holiday. This had already been recommended to Hoover by a Justice Department uneasy about use of the Trading with the Enemy Act.17 Title II then empowered the treasury secretary to reopen financially sound institutions while placing unsound banks under the supervision of conservators.18 A version of this had been prepared for Hoover’s use by the Comptroller of the Currency. Title III authorized the Treasury Department to instruct the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to inject capital into financial institutions, taking preferred stock in return. This eliminated the provision in the RFC act permitting the corporation to lend to illiquid financial institutions but not to inject capital, a distinction that had frustrated its efforts to rescue Henry Ford’s Guardian Group. This had already been recommended to President Hoover by Franklin Fort, a former Republican member of the House Banking and Currency Committee. Title IV, finally, amended the Federal Reserve Act to loosen collateral requirements for lending to illiquid banks. It allowed the Federal Reserve to issue specially designed Federal Reserve Bank Notes, separate from its normal obligations, against “any notes, drafts, bills of exchange or bankers’ acceptances, acquired under the provisions of this act”—against virtually any and all collateral, in other words.

The resulting legislation was not original, but it was comprehensive. Whether it worked would become evident soon enough. Over the weekend the president used his first fireside chat for a simplified exposition of the plan. On Monday, when banks in the twelve Federal Reserve cities reopened, the crisis was over. As the New York Times put it, “In contrast with the ‘runs’ to withdraw funds which preceded the moratorium, there was a general ‘run’ yesterday to deposit or redeposit money. The banks generally reported heavy deposits and small withdrawals. In all cases, deposits were said to be larger than withdrawals.”19 On Tuesday, when banks in other cities reopened, customers complained of the difficulty of getting through the doors for the number of other depositors crowding their lobbies. Capitalism was saved in eight days, as Raymond Moley modestly put it.20

All this happened before any new RFC-backed bank recapitalization. FDR barely had time to install his man Jesse Jones as head of the corporation.21 Yet the return of confidence in the banks was immediate. What does this tell us about the nature of the 1933 banking crisis? It suggests that the crisis was driven, in substantial part, by panic. In the same way that panic can be self-fulfilling, it can be dispatched by a time-out and a reassuring fireside chat. The time-out, as progressive historians Charles Beard and George Smith put it, performed the same function as “a slap in the face for a person gripped by unreasoning hysteria.”22

The fireside chat was more reassuring for the fact that the new president was still enjoying a honeymoon with the public. This in turn suggests that FDR was wise to refuse to cooperate with Hoover. An analogous plan advanced by a discredited president would not have received the same benefit of the doubt. And, extenuating circumstances or not, only a president still on his honeymoon could have pushed such a far-reaching bill through Congress in a matter of hours.

The comprehensive audit of which the Emergency Banking Act spoke and of which historians have spoken subsequently was, in fact, less than comprehensive. It was hardly possible to do a comprehensive audit in two weeks. George Norris, looking back on his experience as governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, describes how, on receiving instructions from Treasury Secretary Woodin on March 10 to take applications from member banks to reopen, he was literally “besieged with visits and telephone calls from bankers all over the district, whom I could not refuse to talk with.” Norris immediately recognized the impossibility “in such a short time to make the careful study of the condition of seven or eight hundred banks which alone would justify my passing a sentence of life or death upon them.” He appointed the chairman of his board, the chief national bank examiner of the district, and the head of his examination department, a Mr. Hill, as a three-person committee to ostensibly make this determination over the subsequent weekend. “It was a delicate and difficult task, so onerous and responsible, and performed under such a cruel limitation as to time” that it drove Mr. Hill to a nervous breakdown.23

If the comprehensive audit was partly smoke and mirrors, the new powers bestowed on the Federal Reserve System were real, and they had very real effects. The Banking Act empowered the Fed to discount notes, drafts, bills, and acceptances as it saw fit, ensuring that the banks would have the liquidity needed to meet the needs of their depositors. This was not yet deposit insurance, but the implicit guarantee had much the same effect.24 The promise that the Fed would intervene with the emergency provision of liquidity, by calming investors, bought time to conduct a more systematic evaluation of the banks, which proceeded over subsequent months, and then for recapitalization—for the injection of additional funds by private investors and the RFC.

These were lessons that were relearned in 2012 when investors in European sovereign debt panicked but the European Central Bank calmed the markets with its program of Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT).25 Much as with the Fed’s commitment to provide emergency liquidity in 1933, OMT didn’t actually have to be activated; its mere announcement was enough to reassure. It at least bought time to conduct additional stress tests and recapitalize the banks.

Finally, the quick return of confidence suggests that the plan as a whole— conservatorship for insolvent banks, a commitment to provide emergency liquidity, and, where necessary, recapitalization with public funds—made a lot of sense. These elements were well known prior to Roosevelt’s taking office; they just had to be implemented. Resolving a banking crisis, this experience suggests, is not rocket science. The special session of Congress, conceived to address the banking crisis, proved so successful that Roosevelt quickly broadened its mandate from one “b” to three. The second “b,” after banking, was beer. FDR proposed legalizing 3.2 percent beer, providing liquid refreshment for his honeymoon.

More consequential was the third “b.” Here the president sought to burnish his conservative credentials by making good on his promise to balance the budget. FDR’s modern critics have made much of the growth of federal spending during his first term. Roosevelt’s deficits were some of the largest in US history outside of wartime. Public debt rose more quickly than in the Hoover years. Ambitious public works projects, from the Grand Coulee Dam to La Guardia Airport, were funded by the Roosevelt administration. Some have gone so far as to argue that deficit spending was the key measure used by the new president to signal his commitment to ending the Depression. By challenging prevailing policy dogmas, they indicated that Roosevelt was intent on changing the policy regime.26

This is a revealing instance of economists seeing in the historical record what they want to see. In fact, Roosevelt did not view himself as out to challenge prevailing policy dogmas, but to uphold them. He believed in balanced budgets. This was an aspect of prevailing policy dogma to which he subscribed as firmly as Hoover.

The president’s goal was to balance the budget immediately, completely, and, if necessary, on the backs of his supporters. His first message to Congress after declaring the bank holiday was on economies in government. “For three long years the Federal Government has been on the road toward bankruptcy,” he solemnly intoned.27 Deficits made for the uncertainty that led to the banking crisis. By undermining confidence, they added to the ranks of the unemployed. To drive home the point, FDR appointed as his budget director Lewis Douglas, a representative from Arizona and the strongest voice in the House for balancing the budget. Douglas had warned more than once of the dire consequences of not doing so. His rhetoric would have warmed the heart of Pete Peterson, the twenty-first-century crusader for a balanced budget.28 Not balancing the budget, Douglas apocalyptically warned, would “plung[e]‌the whole world into darkness.”29

Under the plan drawn up by Douglas, the budget would be balanced entirely through spending cuts.30 Defense spending would fall by 8 percent from amounts budgeted previously.31 This testifies to the priority FDR attached to budget balance, given Japan’s incursion into China and Hitler’s rise. Federal wages and salaries were not just frozen but reduced, saving $20 million and $105 million on the military and civilian sides. The largest single saving came from cuts in military pensions, what today we would call entitlements. These savings would accrue from the elimination of payments to veterans disabled for reasons other than their military service.

This was an extraordinary proposal given that disabled veterans were among those hardest hit by the Depression. If they had voted in 1932, they voted for FDR. Cutting their payments was not something Hoover could have done, given the firestorm whipped up by his decision to allow General Douglas MacArthur, supported by Majors George S. Patton and Dwight D. Eisenhower, to disperse the Bonus Army of World War I veterans encamped in Anacostia.32 Twelve Democratic senators, including Michigan’s James Couzens, opposed the reductions, but the bill passed overwhelmingly.

It is unclear how Roosevelt planned to reconcile this commitment to balanced budgets with his other policy ambitions. The press suggested that he hoped to make greater use of existing resources, using military recruiting offices to reach out to the unemployed, for example, and prior appropriations for the federally owned hydroelectric dam and nitrate plant at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, to expand public works. Others question whether FDR was really committed to budget balance. He was already planning to create an emergency budget, they allege, to be financed by borrowing, alongside a regular budget, which would give the appearance of balance.

The fact of the matter is that Roosevelt was conflicted. He sincerely believed in balancing the budget. But having done so once on the backs of the unemployed, he was not prepared to do so again when economic conditions showed only limited improvement. So, as one New Deal program followed another, the emergency budget expanded.33

Still, none of this weakened FDR’s belief in the principle of balanced budgets. In his 1935 budget message he insisted that “The Federal Government must and shall quit this business of relief” or else pay for whatever elements were not eliminated.34 He repeated the call when Congress showed itself willing to pay out a bonus to World War I veterans in 1936.35

Thus, if FDR’s fiscal policy was a “change in regime,” this was a change that would take the advent of World War II to acquire conviction. His deficits were inadvertent. As Keynes had warned in his December 1933 letter, they were too small to make a difference.36 More important for changing the outlook was monetary policy. This was not yet decided by the gold embargo of March 4, which prohibited banks from paying out gold coin, bullion, or certificates and allowed gold to be exported only under licenses granted by Secretary Woodin. FDR had no choice but to impose the embargo; Hoover would have done so already had he not lost the will to act. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was out of gold. Had foreigners sought to export it, there was no way the bank could have furnished it.

But the embargo was widely thought to be temporary, just as the bank holiday was temporary, and it could have easily ended up as such. The United States had suspended gold convertibility before, in the exceptional circumstances of the Civil War, but resumed it subsequently. Other countries had suspended and resumed after World War I. Treasury Secretary Woodin’s first words on taking office were to reassure everyone within earshot that the United States had not left the gold standard. “It is ridiculous and misleading to say that we have gone off the gold standard, any more than we have gone off the currency standard,” he announced. “Gold merely cannot be obtained for several days.” Woodin was not being disingenuous; as an avid supporter of the monetary status quo, he believed what he said.37 Roosevelt took six weeks to weigh his options. This was long enough to conclude that a functioning banking system and whatever confidence a balanced budget might inspire were not enough to sustain a recovery. Conditions had improved between March and April, but then it is hard to imagine that they could have worsened, given the catastrophic starting point. Not just banks but also shops and factories were closed. With no money in their pockets, people were not buying. Across America the streets were quiet, even deserted. In Akron, Ohio, “The rubber shops closed. Streetcars ran on half schedules. Coal companies shut. Thousands of men still employed despite the Depression were sent home from work ‘temporarily laid off.’”38 Although April was better than March, it was not better than January before the state bank holidays. Industrial production in April barely matched the January level. Employment actually fell by an additional 2.3 percent over the three months from January.39

Clearly, more had to be done. Roosevelt’s first step was to announce that the embargo on gold exports would continue indefinitely. This opened the door to other measures to push prices up, like those advocated by Senator Elmer Thomas, who proposed a measure mandating government purchases of silver. Thomas, recall, had already been advocating similar measures in 1932, prompting the Fed to take preemptive expansionary action.40 Which way FDR would now jump became clear when he and Thomas met on April 19. The two men emerged with a compromise that Thomas appended to the bill that became the Agricultural Adjustment Act. The revised Thomas amendment did not set a target for silver purchases but gave the president permission to reduce the gold content of the dollar—equivalently, to push up the dollar price of gold—by as much as 50 percent.

The Dow Jones Average surged by 9 percent on the news. Even today, April 19 remains on the list of the twenty largest daily percentage gains. So much, then, for the belief that abandoning the gold standard would devastate confidence. “The rank and file of the financial district embraced with enthusiasm the prospects of inflation after years of grinding deflation” was the way the New York Times put it.41

The second step was to make clear that the change was permanent—that the administration had no intention of again subordinating price stability to the imperatives of the gold standard. This Roosevelt accomplished by informing the World Monetary and Economic Conference that stable prices were his priority. The conference had convened in London on June 10. Within three weeks, conferees drew up a declaration calling for a return to the international gold standard.42 Although their statement was hedged with allowances for countries to return at a time and level of their choosing, there was nonetheless the prospect that it would create pressure for resumption at previously prevailing exchange rates.

That the US delegation had been able to agree on anything was remarkable in itself. Along with Hull, a dyed-in the-wool free trader, Roosevelt sent Key Pittman, an acolyte of William Jennings Bryan. Pittman, the senior senator from the silver-mining state of Nevada and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, had inserted into the 1932 Democratic Party platform a plank advocating an international monetary conference; what was left unsaid was his hope that the conference might decide in favor of silver coinage. Now, in London, Pittman left nothing unsaid. He talked nonstop about measures to support silver prices. The exasperated lead German delegate, none other than Hjalmar Schacht, waved his hands in despair on being subjected to yet another Pittman lecture. There is no shortage of tales of Pittman’s adventures in London, including his shooting out streetlamps with his revolver and taking a bath in a sink in the pantry at Claridge’s.43

Another prominent member of the US delegation was Senator William Couzens, the onetime Henry Ford partner whose influence had made it difficult for the RFC to rescue the Guardian Trust Company.44 FDR may have chosen Couzens for his protectionist views—that is, to neutralize the secretary of state. If so, he was not disappointed. Couzens repeatedly clashed with Hull, speaking out against tariff reductions and refusing to be bound by Hull’s instruction that all public statements by US delegates be cleared through him. FDR also sent James Cox, the former governor of Ohio and newspaper publisher, whose hard-money views neutralized those of Pittman. The remaining two delegates were Representative Samuel McReynolds of Tennessee and Ralph Morrison, a wealthy Texan. None of the members of the six-person delegation had prior experience with an international conference.

Roosevelt may have been surprised that, with this kind of leadership from the Americans, the conference made progress, but he was quick to capitalize on the fact. On July 3, in his bombshell message, transmitted to London from Washington, D.C., he rejected the conference declaration, asserting that priority should instead be attached to policies stabilizing the purchasing power of money. He dismissed the gold standard as exemplifying “the old fetishes of international bankers,” language that succeeded in antagonizing the bankers and foreign leaders equally. The inflammatory rhetoric was designed to make his priorities unmistakable, not just to the delegates in London but to the American public. Historians continue to ask what convinced investors that the administration was committed to raising prices. What convinced them was that Roosevelt was prepared to antagonize his allies, shoulder blame for the collapse of the conference, and hang his own delegation out to dry. FDR’s bombshell has been criticized for driving a final nail into the coffin of international cooperation. It was invoked in 2008–09 as an example of the kind of nationalistic policies that governments responding to the Great Recession should avoid.45 By pushing down the dollar, the United States aggravated the competitiveness problems of other countries. By derailing the conference, Roosevelt destroyed the last chance for a coordinated response.

In fact, this supposed “lesson” of history is mistaken. The alternative to monetary nationalism was not a coordinated response to the Depression for the simple reason that governments could not agree on how to respond. European governments saw the priority as stable exchange rates rather than a stable price level. Rather than seeking to vanquish deflation, they saw inflation, by which they were haunted as a result of their 1920s experience, as the real and pressing danger. Not having experienced a slump as long and deep as that of the United States, they continued to prioritize liquidation over recovery. Only if speculators felt sufficient pain, they insisted, would another round of excesses and an even more serious depression be avoided. This was not a view with which Roosevelt could make common cause.

So much, then, for coordinated action. Officials in various countries were unable to agree on a common diagnosis of the economic problem, pointing them to different remedies. Initially, Roosevelt hoped otherwise. As recently as April 19 he had spoken of the desirability of stabilizing currencies, which would be feasible if countries also agreed on coordinated reflationary action. But meetings with other heads of state, notably Édouard Herriot, the former prime minister who chaired the foreign affairs committee in the French Chamber of Deputies, convinced him that it was not to be.46 The only route to reflation was unilateral. It ran through the bombshell message.47

In 2008–09 there would be more scope for coordinated action because the authorities in various countries shared a common diagnosis of the problem. The idea that the collapse of the World Economic Conference in 1933 was regrettable and that anything similar should now be avoided—like the textbook interpretation of the Smoot-Hawley tariff—was an instance of bad history encouraging good policy. Roosevelt’s third step was to push up the price of gold, and with it the prices of other commodities. On October 22 he announced he was authorizing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to purchase newly mined gold. The timing is explained by pressure from Western states to get agricultural prices up. Dissatisfied by the pace of progress, Senator Thomas, ever the instigator, announced a conference of farm and industry leaders on October 24 and threatened to lead a million-man march on Washington.

The president now sought to preempt this movement. Every morning, over his breakfast of orange juice and eggs, he decided in consultation with Henry Morgenthau and Jesse Jones by how many cents to raise the RFC’s offer price. On some days he raised it by a couple of cents, on others more. The purpose, as Jones later described it, was to keep the speculators guessing.48

The goal of higher commodity prices and the strategy of pursuing it by pushing up the price of a particular commodity, gold, were clear. But the tactics were opaque. No one knew by how much the president would push up the price of gold on a particular day. Critics complained that the administration’s capricious approach was discouraging investment. In November, the Federal Advisory Council, a group of bankers advising the Federal Reserve Board, warned that uncertainty was depressing the bond markets. Only when that uncertainty was removed, the council admonished, would there be a lasting improvement in business.

Keynes, in his December letter to the president, agreed. “The recent gyrations of the dollar,” he wrote, “have looked to me more like a gold standard on the booze than the ideal managed currency of my dreams.” FDR’s game of blindman’s bluff with currency speculators was creating confusion. Stabilizing the price of gold at a higher level, say $35 an ounce, was one way of removing this uncertainty. But doing so might be inconsistent with the president’s goal of boosting commodity prices. Better, Keynes concluded, was for the administration to announce a goal for monetary policy—a price level target, for example—and a modus operandi for achieving it. His preference was for the Treasury to intervene in the foreign exchange market to hold the dollar within a range but push it up or down as needed to keep the price level stable.49

Keynes’ recommendation, not for the first time, made a lot of sense. FDR’s decision in January to instead re-peg the dollar to gold at $35 an ounce could have been a disaster.50 There could have been gold outflows, putting downward pressure on the money supply, in which case deflation and the negative expectations it engendered would have been back.

As it turned out, economic problems and political tensions in Europe caused gold to flow toward America rather than away. The gold bloc centered on France was still locked in deflation, and investors were looking for a way out. The storm clouds of World War II were already blowing up. In response, European investors shifted toward the dollar, an obvious safe haven. As they did so, they pumped up US supplies of money and credit, helping to stabilize the American price level.51 Roosevelt’s monetary policy may have been less than ideal, but fortunately for him, European policy was worse. Readers will recognize here the dollar’s “exorbitant privilege” as the world’s only true safe haven currency.52 The origins of that status, then, go back to 1934. This was the first in what eventually became a long series of instances when investors rushed into dollars in response to untoward events. This behavior gave the United States, in effect, an automatic insurance policy—that is, a currency that strengthens when things go wrong. This insurance would come in handy in 2008 with the failure of Lehman Brothers.
