title: Chapter 21 Unconventional Policy
---



Even more controversial, if that is possible, were the policies of the Federal Reserve. The Fed was criticized equally for doing too much and too little. Members of the too-much school warned that its insistence on keeping interest rates low augured an explosion of inflation. When that inflation failed to materialize, they then dismissed the Fed’s credit market interventions as frustrating the necessary consolidation of the country’s finances. The central bank, they warned, was only setting the stage for more financial excesses like those that caused the crisis.

Members of the too-little school, for their part, complained that the Fed had abdicated its responsibility for full employment. Preoccupied by credit market conditions and intimidated by pugnacious critics, the central bank hesitated to turn to unconventional policies, and when it did a strict upper limit was specified on what would be done, limiting the effectiveness of its interventions. It allowed inflation to undershoot normal levels. It allowed nominal income to stagnate.

The Fed started injecting large amounts of credit into the economy, recall, following the failure of Lehman Brothers. It pushed the Fed funds rate down toward zero and set a 0.–0.25 percent target for the rate on December 16, 2008. But even then there was little sign that low interest rates were having the desired effect. Given heightened risk aversion, there was a visible reluctance to borrow and spend on the part of households and firms.

The question was what to do next. Here there were three options (first considered at the Fed’s two-day policy meeting on December 15–16). One was to make statements about future policy with the goal of shaping expectations and through that channel to attempt to influence spending. If the Fed could use 分页。。。statements of intent to create expectations of higher inflation, then households and firms anticipating higher prices would be more inclined to spend.1 In 1933 FDR attempted to shape expectations of future prices and policies by loudly rejecting “the old fetishes of so-called international bankers.” Perhaps the Fed now could say something less provocative but equally forceful.

The challenge for Fed officials was to make credible statements about future policy. Were inflation to rise above a politically comfortable level of, say, 2 percent, there would be pressure on the Federal Open Market Committee to tighten. Bondholders and others on fixed incomes would make their displeasure known. The Fed would feel the political heat.

Monetary policy makers, moreover, were indoctrinated for generations in the impossibility of being half-pregnant. If inflation was allowed to exceed customary levels, they feared, the central bank could lose control. The credibility of its commitment to maintaining price stability would be damaged, undermining the ability to achieve its goals. Memories of the 1970s, for those who had lived through the decade, and histories of the 1970s for those who had not, strongly informed the outlook of officials, shaping and constraining policy.

For all these reasons, raising inflation above 2 percent and keeping it there would not be easy. Statements to this effect threatened to collide with the central bank’s mandate for low and stable inflation. That the responsible policy under the circumstances was to act irresponsibly, allowing inflation to rise temporarily, encapsulated the contradictions of the crisis. Such convoluted arguments did not sit easily with the straightforward demeanor of central bankers.

The FOMC groped for language that was both acceptable and effective, the problem being that what was acceptable was not effective, and what was effective was not likely to be acceptable. Starting in December 2008 it spoke of conditions warranting “exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.” “For some time” was weaker than “until unemployment falls to 6.5 percent” or “until growth consistently exceeds 3 percent.” Stronger statements would have constituted acknowledgment that the FOMC prioritized other factors as much as it did inflation. Doing so would have been appropriate in the circumstances of an exceptional crisis. It would have been the responsibly irresponsible policy. But the contradiction was more than monetary policy makers could bear.

This dilemma prompted consideration of a related option, namely adopting an explicit inflation target. The Fed could endorse a target of, say, 3 percent and declare readiness to pursue whatever policies were required to hit it. Bernanke was a proponent of an inflation target in his earlier academic incarnation.2 A formal target, he had argued, was easy to communicate. The policies for achieving it were easy to justify and explain. It would then be correspondingly less likely that aggressive moves to support a depressed economy would be misinterpreted as the Fed abandoning its commitment to price stability. The effectiveness of policy would be enhanced.

But for a target to be credible, it would have to be pursued through thick and thin. It would have to be a beacon for policy whether the economy was doing badly or well. It would have to be set at a high level in the short run to give the economy a significant boost. But there might then be pressure to reduce it subsequently. And if it was common knowledge that the target was not set in stone, whether the Fed was committed to achieving it would inevitably be questioned.3

Skeptics also questioned whether it was within the capacity of the Fed to raise inflation to 3 percent under depressed conditions. A formal inflation target, they warned, would violate the cardinal rule that policy makers should never target a variable they couldn’t control. Much later, in 2012, the Fed moved part way toward an inflation target, issuing a “longer-run goals and policy strategy statement” identifying 2 percent as the inflation rate best aligned with its mandate. A year after that, the FOMC committed to keeping interest rates low until unemployment reached 6.5 percent.

This, finally, was the kind of numerical guidance advocated in 2009 by those who complained that the Fed was too timid. But back in 2009, in the throes of the crisis, the consensus to make such numerical commitments was not there.4 The institutional apparatus for monetary policy adopted in the course of previous decades, at whose center was the mandate to pursue low inflation, continued to guide and constrain policy. When most of the Reserve bank presidents serving on the FOMC, if not also the chairman, looked back at history, they looked back at the 1970s, when an outburst of inflation damaged the central bank’s credibility. Highly unconventional policies such as explicit numerical guidelines suitable for highly unconventional circumstances were not yet in the cards. The third and final option was asset purchases. These were a way for the Fed to signal a commitment to avoiding deflation and of shaping market expectations. They could be used to make credit available to specific markets like that for home mortgages. Pushing the Fed funds rate to zero affected the short-term interest rates at which banks lent to one another but had only an oblique impact on rates on mortgages and corporate bonds. But by purchasing asset-backed securities, the Fed could attempt to influence the latter directly.

QE1, the first round of quantitative easing, sailed in November 2008, when the Fed announced it would purchase $600 billion of loans and securities of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks and created the TALF to buy $180 billion of consumer loans. In March 2009 it then raised the ceiling for purchases of mortgage-related securities and announced it would buy $300 billion of longer-term treasury securities. But as the implications sank in, investors realized the message was ambiguous. Convincing the markets that it would do whatever it took required the Fed to commit to continuing asset purchases until the risk of deflation had passed. But QE1 was limited in size. By tracking the central bank’s balance sheet, investors could determine when the program would end. Specifically, they could see that it would end in the second half of 2009.

But Bernanke and his FOMC colleagues hesitated to issue an open-ended commitment. They were anxious to reassure everyone within earshot that, bad as things were, the United States was not at risk of a Japan-like slump, and that the Fed had not been driven, in desperation, to open-ended easing. The Fed’s interventions, as they characterized them, were selective and surgical. They were designed to open the financial system’s clogged arteries and restore the free flow of credit. Bernanke emphasized that the Fed was engaging in “credit easing” with the goal of restoring the functioning of specific credit markets, not quantitative easing in the manner of Japan.

Unfortunately, this hair splitting limited the effectiveness of the policy. Expected inflation remained perilously close to zero through much of 2009 and 2010. Private employment growth was running below a hundred thousand jobs a month, less than half what was needed to reduce the unemployment rate. The United States was then hit by the debt crisis in Europe, exciting fears of a double-dip recession. There was worry inside and outside the Fed that the US economy was slowing to stall speed. All these were arguments for doing more. Discussions within the FOMC turned from inflation, which had continued to preoccupy many members of the committee in 2008, to the risk of a Japan-style deflation in 2010. Indicative of this was how James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis—previously a leader among those warning of inflation—shifted into the dangers-of-deflation camp.5

This was an impressive display of the ability of a central banker to shed his earlier intellectual skin. It was admirable flexibility and ability to recognize that circumstances had changed—at least by the standards of the 1930s, when the better part of four years and appropriation of monetary control by the executive branch from the central bank had been required for an equally radical reorientation of policy. No doubt histories of 1930s experience, as taught by the likes of Friedman and Schwartz, had something to do with the contrast.

Yet through late 2010 the Fed bought just $30 billion of treasury notes a month, barely enough to keep its balance sheet from shrinking as securities purchased earlier matured.6 This reluctance to do more reflected the drumbeat of external criticism of the central bank. Warnings that it was setting the stage for an inflationary explosion continued nonstop. Although this argument was made in its most unvarnished form by radio talk-show hosts, for whom it was a way of attracting an audience, members of the Federal Reserve Board and regional Reserve bank presidents hesitated to dismiss it out of hand. One can’t help but be reminded of the reluctance of the Bank of England to cut interest in the months following Britain’s departure from the gold standard in 1931, until it eventually became clear that no Weimar-style inflation was in the cards.

Other critics questioned the effectiveness of the central bank’s securities purchases and argued that they did more to create uncertainty than to resolve it. The Fed, they fretted, would take losses on its portfolio of long-term investments when interest rates recovered. They warned of asset bubbles. Insofar as quantitative easing provided an incentive for businesses and consumers to bring forward spending to today, they worried that it might only reduce spending tomorrow, creating an endless demand for quantitative easing to keep the economy going. They warned that by providing cheap liquidity, the Fed was relieving the pressure for Congress and the president to more forcefully recapitalize still-undercapitalized banks. They argued that the Fed should recognize that the economy was being held back by an oversupply of new homes, by the need to shift resources from construction to other activities, and by the heavy indebtedness of households, problems that could not be solved by monetary action alone.

Indeed, it was argued that insofar as the first round of quantitative easing involved mainly purchases of mortgage-related paper, these only delayed the inevitable adjustment of the housing market. Such structural problems required a congressional response. It followed that Federal Reserve initiatives papering them over merely relieved the pressure on the politicians to act. The critics complained that the Fed had exceeded its mandate to act as a responsible steward of the currency and that, if it wouldn’t rein in these efforts on its own, legislators should do so for it.

These criticisms may or may not have been justified. The costs of the Fed’s policies may or may not have outweighed the benefits. But whatever one’s view, there is no question that these critiques left the members of the FOMC reluctant to do more. Given this political context, the timing of the decision to launch a second round of quantitative easing was not entirely a surprise. This came on November 3, 2010, one day after the midterm congressional elections. QE2 involved the purchase of $600 billion of treasury securities over eight months. The new rate of purchase was about two and a half times what the Fed had been doing the previous year. Markets responded as they had to QE1, which is to say positively. In early 2011 inflation expectations moved up from 1.4 percent, uncomfortably close to deflationary territory, to a healthier 3 percent.

QE2 was attacked by Republicans who had just regained control of the House of Representatives for setting the country up for a burst of inflation. Depressing the interest rate on treasury bonds made it easier for the government to borrow, which they argued reduced the pressure for Congress and the White House to address the country’s debt and deficit problems. By fueling financial market excesses, if not now then in the future, the policy set the stage for an even more debilitating crisis.

Finance ministers in Europe, Asia, and Latin America meanwhile denounced QE2 for pushing down the dollar. They portrayed the policy as attempting to solve America’s problems at foreign expense. Brazilian finance minister Guido Mantega accused the US central bank of engaging in a currency war. German finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble criticized the Fed for “artificially depress[ing] the dollar exchange rate by printing money.”7 The motives of these foreign critics varied. The European critics worried that the strength of the euro against the dollar aggravated the competitive difficulties of the struggling Eurozone periphery. In Latin America, the strength of local currencies against the dollar similarly created competitiveness problems. Low interest rates in the United States encouraged capital to flow toward emerging markets, where yields were higher, feeding frothy asset markets and excessive bank lending. The effects varied, but one thing these countries had in common was their distaste for US monetary policy.

History would show these criticisms to have been misplaced. Contrary to the predictions of the American critics, inflation continued to run below 2 percent, not just for the life of the program but for several years subsequently. The economy’s problem was not budget deficits and structural imbalances as opposed to inadequate demand; it was both. And where it was fully within the capacity of the Fed to address the problem of deficient demand, there was no evidence that doing so reduced the pressure on policy makers to tackle other issues. QE2 did not prevent US policy makers from addressing the budget deficit; it did not deter them from raising taxes on the wealthy or imposing the Sequester to limit the growth of discretionary spending in 2013. And worries that encouraging households and firms to bring spending forward to the present might simply reduce spending in the future, putting the central bank on a treadmill from which it could not escape, reflected the fallacy that there existed a fixed lump of spending that could only be redistributed over time. Foreign officials, for their part, failed to ask whether they would have been better off had the US central bank failed to act. For the Fed to instead allow the United States to slip back into recession would have been devastating for the rest of the world. But their critical comments, misguided or not, did not make it easier for the Fed to stay the course, much less for it to ramp up its security purchase programs further. They did not make for a happy backdrop to President Obama’s appearance at the G20 summit in Seoul, South Korea, in November 2010. Obama had hoped to position himself as a champion of international economic and financial cooperation. Instead, the Fed’s “bombshell message” announcing QE2 made the Seoul summit come off more like the 1933 World Economic Conference.

Given its reluctance to do more, Fed policy was only a temporary palliative. Inflation expectations, after rising to 3 percent in early 2011, fell back until they were once more hovering at barely 1 percent when the program expired in early summer. In the case of QE2 as with QE1 before it, reluctance to make an open-ended commitment rendered the Fed’s policy just a temporary sugar high.

The third time, hopefully, was the charm. In September 2011 the Fed announced plans to purchase ten-year treasury bonds using the proceeds from sales of its existing holdings of shorter-dated treasury securities. The program was designed to reduce ten-year treasury and mortgage rates with the goal of stimulating the housing market and investment generally. It did not entail further expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet. Rather, the policy involved shifting the composition of the portfolio toward more long-dated paper in order to depress long rates relative to short rates. It was designed to twist the term structure of interest rates, if you will.

The new program was dubbed “Operation Twist” to signify the fact. The advantage of the label was that it was not QE3 and could not be attacked as more of the same. It had a historical precedent, namely an earlier Operation Twist, undertaken in 1961 with the goal of pushing down long rates to encourage investment while keeping short rates high to support the balance of payments. In 2011, when the Fed was under constant criticism for its unprecedented interventions, a precedent afforded political cover. Avoiding a further expansion of the central bank’s balance sheet was also a way of bringing on board FOMC members worried about the inflationary consequences of security purchases.

The initial plan was to purchase $400 billion of long-term treasuries between October 2011 and June 2012. With employment growth still slow in the summer of 2012, the FOMC then extended the program through the end of the year, with one Reserve bank president, Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond, dissenting. In September, with the economy still weak, it added $40 billion of outright purchases of mortgage securities in a move that was unavoidably labeled QE3. At the end of the 2012, with unemployment still at 7.7 percent, the FOMC then announced that the Fed would continue buying treasury securities at the previous rate of $45 billion a month, although now that it was essentially out of short-term securities it would no longer sell these in equivalent amounts. Purchases of mortgage-backed securities would continue as well. Richmond Reserve Bank President Lacker once more voted against.

This, now, was a significant departure from prior policy. For the first time, the Fed made an open-ended commitment to keep interest rates low and continue its security purchases until the economy healed. Accommodative policies would remain in place as long as unemployment exceeded 6.5 percent and inflation remained less than 2.5 percent. This commitment was designed to influence expectations, and it did. Expected inflation, having hovered close to zero and falling alarmingly into negative territory in the second half of 2012, now moved up toward 1 percent.

The problem was that expectations of inflation did not rise higher. They still failed to approach the central bank’s 2 percent target. That the Fed committed only to maintaining security purchases at their previous pace and not to increase them further presumably explains why the target continued to be missed. The challenge for evaluating fiscal stimulus is that different models yield different results. In the case of quantitative easing, the problem is worse since there are essentially no models. The macroeconomic models used by central banks have underspecified financial sectors. The inability of those models to effectively capture how changes in financial conditions affect the economy was, after all, one reason the financial imbalances of the pre-2008 period went undetected.

Policy evaluation, like the policy being evaluated, necessarily proceeds by the seat of its pants. A first, obvious place to look is at the change in interest rates. Ten-year treasury bond yields declined from 3.35 percent before the first round of quantitative easing to a little more than 2 percent by the end of 2008. The question is how much of this was due to policy as opposed to a weak economy, fears of deflation, and the flight to safety, all of which similarly put downward pressure on treasury yields. One would want to know how much of the effect was enduring; treasury rates began moving up again in early 2009, leading some critics to suggest that the program had no more than a transient effect. One would also want to know the impact on rates on riskier assets more relevant for private investment decisions. And what is ultimately at stake, of course, is the impact on employment and economic growth. Policy analysts have no choice but to assemble an answer using separate sources of evidence, like a child building a tower out of Lego bricks. To gauge the impact of Fed purchases on ten-year treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, they compare the yields on these securities before and after policy announcements. They then examine the response of corporate bond rates to changes in treasury yields. Finally, to gauge the impact on output and employment, they can feed the change in corporate bond yields into a large-scale model of the economy.

The first step, then, is to examine ten-year treasury rates around the time of policy announcements. If the period is short—just the day before and after the announcement, for example—then it is plausible that this policy announcement and not confounding factors on adjoining days accounts for the observed change in rates. Joseph Gagnon and three Federal Reserve colleagues used this approach to evaluate the first round of quantitative easing, comparing interest rates immediately before and after its announcement.8 They found that the ten-year treasury yield fell by a little less than 100 basis points.9 The central bank would have had to reduce the federal funds rate by fully 200 basis points to achieve an effect of this magnitude, had the Fed funds rate not already been cut to zero, of course.

In addition, the ten-year treasury yield fell even more than the two-year yield. This suggests that the announcement operated mainly by indicating that the Fed would be draining long-duration securities from the market. Investors appear to have been skeptical that the FOMC, by announcing its program of security purchases, was committing to keep policy rates low for an extended period. Had they believed this, the announcement would have exerted an equally powerful effect on short-term rates. This is consistent with the view that because QE1 was limited in scope it had only a limited effect in changing expectations of future Fed policy.

Writing subsequent to the four Fed economists, Arvind Krishnamurthy and Anna Vissing-Jorgensen were able to consider QE2 as well as QE1.10 They looked at interest rates not just on treasury bonds but also on the mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds that matter for real estate lending and corporate investment. In addition, they compared the minutes and hours immediately before and after the announcement. Considering this shorter time period makes it even less likely that the observed change in interest rates is being contaminated by other factors.11

Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen found that QE1 and QE2 placed downward pressure on interest rates on ten-year treasuries and also other relatively safe assets. More importantly, QE1, in the course of which the Fed purchased more than $1 trillion of mortgage-related obligations, also had a negative impact on yields on risky mortgage-backed securities, as well as a smaller negative impact on corporate bonds.12 In contrast, QE2, which was limited to purchases of treasury bonds, had only a small impact on mortgage-backed securities and no impact on corporate bonds. This may explain why, when launching QE3, the Fed again focused on mortgage-backed securities—and why the housing market recovered in 2013.

So when the Fed purchased safe assets, it mainly succeeded in driving down interest rates on safe assets. When it purchased risky assets, something it did only sporadically because doing so was politically contentious, it mainly succeeded in driving down returns on risky assets. In both cases it had little success in using security purchases to signal that it would keep policy rates low for an extended period or to raise expectations of inflation. Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen do find some evidence of changes in the prices of Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), pointing to a modest positive impact on inflation expectations. They find some sign that QE announcements had a modest negative impact on short-term treasury rates, as if investors took those announcements as a signal that the Fed might keep its policy rate lower for longer. Evidently, the more times the Fed repeated the policy, the more it succeeded in convincing investors it was prepared to stay the course.

Even so, expectations of inflation continued to undershoot the Fed’s 2 percent target. With hindsight, larger purchases and bolder statements would have been better. But given the political pressure, this was not to be.

Finally, one can use a model of the economy to rerun history without the Fed’s asset purchases. Janet Yellen, who was then vice-chair of the Federal Reserve Board, reported such an exercise using the Federal Reserve’s in-house model in early 2011.13 The results suggested that unemployment would have been 1 to 1 ½ percentage points higher in the absence of QE1 and QE2. Private payroll employment would have been roughly two million jobs lower.

The linkages between financial markets and the economy are not one of the strengths of this class of models, as noted. That said, these are the best estimates we have. Put them together with estimates of the impact of the fiscal stimulus, and it appears that the fall in the unemployment rate from 10 percent in October 2009 to 7.5 percent in early 2013 was largely attributable to policy. As Mervyn King averred, policy makers prevented another Great Depression. They prevented the unemployment rate from persistently exceeding 10 percent.

At the same time, they could have done more. And their failure to do so largely explains why the recovery continued to disappoint.
