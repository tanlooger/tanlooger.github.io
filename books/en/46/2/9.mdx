title: Chapter 9 On Europe’s Shores
---



A little over a year passed between the eruption of the subprime crisis in the United States and its reaching Europe’s shores. Similarly, it took barely more than a year from the Wall Street Crash in 1929 for the focus to shift to Europe. Much of the continent was already reeling from the sudden stop in capital flows from the United States and the drop in US merchandise imports. This double-barreled shock meant gold losses for central banks, which they sought to limit by keeping interest rates high. But even though high rates provided an incentive for Europeans to keep their funds at home, they did nothing to encourage firms to invest or households to spend. Where the New York Fed cut its discount rate to 2 percent in December 1930 following the failure of the Bank of United States, the Bank of England was forced to keep its discount rate at 3 percent, and the Reichsbank at an even more painful 5 percent.

The Bank of France was the one European bank in a position to emulate the New York Fed’s low interest rate policy, which it did by cutting the discount rate to 2 percent at the beginning of 1931. Having stabilized late, France was not a big foreign borrower and relied little on capital imports. The country’s export prices were competitive owing to the franc’s depreciation in the first half of the 1920s. As a result, industrial production held steady through much of 1930, excepting only luxury trades hit by the stock market crash (less claret for the bankers).

Moreover, France experienced just one bank failure of consequence, that of Banque Adam, a Calais-based lender brought down by the dubious investments of its principal shareholder, Albert Oustric. Oustric was yet another of those outsized 1920s characters in the manner of Clarence Hatry and Rogers 分页。。。Caldwell. He started as a waiter in a Carcassonne café. He then worked for a French armaments manufacturer, rising through the ranks during World War I, and made his fortune helping a politically connected Italian financier, Ricardo Gualino, list the shares of his textile manufacturing firm, Snia Viscosa, on the Paris Bourse. Snia had been founded as a trading company before being reorganized in 1922 to produce rayon, like radio, another of the growth industries of the 1920s. (Better rayon than jute.) By 1925 Snia Viscosa accounted for 60 percent of Italian rayon production and was the second-largest producer globally. Gualino had help in growing his business from Mussolini and the Bank of Italy, or at least until he wrote a letter to the prime minister protesting the high level at which the lira was stabilized in 1926. Gualino was understandably sensitive to the matter, if not to Mussolini’s reaction to his letter, because his firm exported 80 percent of its production. But for Mussolini, a high and stable lira was a measure of Italy’s national prestige and of its leader’s accomplishment. When Gualino’s heavily indebted industrial empire collapsed in the Depression, he was arrested and sentenced to five years of confinement “for having done serious damage to the national economy.”

In the meantime, Oustric made hay while the sun shone, using his profits from Snia to acquire other firms. Companies producing boots and shoes, silk, woolens, leather goods, and sewing machines were his specialty, paralleling Hatry’s Drapery Trust. Oustric reorganized the firms in question and issued more stock than necessary, again in the manner of Hatry. This strained the finances of the resulting companies but gave Oustric cash with which to pursue further acquisitions.

And, again like Hatry, Oustric advanced his scheme by acquiring a captive financial institution. He founded the Oustric Bank and expanded its capital from 60 million to 100 million francs, with Gualino subscribing a quarter of the shares. Oustric then gained control of the venerable Banque Adam, a Pas-de-Calais bank that could trace its lineage back to 1784.

In contrast to Montagu Norman’s suspicion of Hatry, Bank of France officials seem to have been supportive of Oustric. But Gualino’s falling-out with Mussolini, which depressed the value of Oustric’s Snia Viscosa shares, and then the decline in the stock market in 1929 undermined his business model. Oustric drew funds from Banque Adam to buy shares in his companies and support their prices, another Hatry-like tactic, but to no avail. When those other ventures went bad, they took Banque Adam down with them. Oustric was arrested for fraud, embezzlement, and engaging in financial irregularities related to Banque Adam. Found guilty, he served thirty-eight months and paid a fine of 31,000 francs.1 The political Left and Right both sought to capitalize on the affair. The Right pointed to the involvement of René Besnard, former French ambassador to Italy, in the Snia Viscosa transaction, while the Left emphasized the fact that a number of current and former ministers were on Oustric’s payroll. In particular, Raoul Péret, who authorized the Snia Viscosa listing when serving as minister of finance in 1926, subsequently accepted a retainer to serve as Oustric’s legal advisor. The revelation so embarrassed the Center-Right government of André Tardieu as to force its resignation.

The political fallout was dramatic, but the only immediate economic impact of the Calais bank’s failure was to prevent the fishing fleet of Boulogne from obtaining the advances needed to put out to sea. However unfortunate for the fishermen, this was nothing compared to the turbulent seas buffeting other countries. The Bank of France still had ample gold reserves, and it could acquire more by liquidating the sterling balances accumulated in the wake of the Poincaré stabilization. The question in the aftermath of l’affaire Oustric was when economic and financial conditions did deteriorate, not whether the government would have the resources to address them but if it would have the will. In the meantime, the flow of gold toward France meant losses for other central banks, which they attempted to offset by keeping interest rates high. In addition, the Bank of France’s ongoing conversion of sterling into gold put pressure on the Bank of England. The Bank of France was criticized by British economists for ignoring the impact of its policies on other countries, not that French officials were inclined to take heed.2 With the French economy still doing well, they did not feel the urgency that informed contemporary British commentary. It is tempting to draw an analogy with German Sorglosigkeit (insouciance) when the euro crisis broke, what with the German economy doing well. If the French balance of payments was strong while the British balance of payments was weak, this was simply a reflection of the hard work the French people had undertaken to strengthen their economy and of Britain’s failure to put its economic and financial house in order. If France enjoyed a balance-of-payments surplus, then this reflected the innate frugality of the French, who preferred saving over spending. Will Rogers, ever the trenchant observer, attributed France’s seeming prosperity to national character and a penchant for “hard work and watching the pennies.”3 If the British found it hard to honor requests to convert sterling into gold, then this was a problem of their own making. Here again it is tempting again to draw an analogy with the euro crisis and with Germans’ scorn for their profligate Southern European neighbors. One can’t help but be reminded of Germany’s failure to see that one country’s surpluses are necessarily another’s deficits.

Even if Bank of France officials had wanted to do something, which they didn’t, their options were limited. Having endured a chaotic inflation, France now operated a gold standard of the most inflexible sort. The Bank of France was prohibited from purchasing domestic securities, so as to prevent it from directly financing the government, as it famously had in the 1920s. Securities purchases and sales (open market operations) as an instrument for shaping financial market conditions and thereby influencing the direction of gold flows were unavailable. There is an obvious parallel with Article 123 of the statute of the European Central Bank, which prohibits purchasing newly issued government bonds, a restriction that made it hard for the ECB to intervene to stabilize the bond market in 2011–12. A clever ECB eventually found ways around these restrictions, and the Bank of France might have done the same.4 It could have exploited a loophole allowing it to purchase the bonds of the government’s debt management agency, the Caisse d’Amortissement. It could have purchased dollars and sterling, injecting francs into circulation through these transactions on the foreign exchange market.

But its directors were not so inclined, and they were not much influenced by the arguments of foreigners. The Bank of France continued to accumulate gold, intensifying the pressure on other countries. It would not be long before those other countries, and France itself, would pay the piper. Events in Germany brought matters to a head. Having relied more than any other country on capital imports, Germany was hit hardest when these came to a stop. With memories of inflation still fresh, private citizens and officials alike saw gold convertibility as paramount. The question now was whether convertibility could be successfully defended and, if not, what consequences would follow.

In 1930 Hjalmar Schacht was succeeded as head of the Reichsbank by the hardworking, ambitious Hans Luther. Luther was a lifetime politician who had served as town councilor in Magdeburg, as mayor of Essen, and then briefly as chancellor in 1925–26. He had been minister of food and agriculture during the hyperinflation, when he urged restaurants to reduce the size of portions as a way of limiting price increases. Now, as prices and production began to fall, his advice was even less trenchant.

Luther understood at least one thing: the Reichsbank would have little leeway if it became necessary to intervene in support of the banking system. This possibility was hardly remote. Big German banks had lent extensively to industry, exposing them to the economic downturn. Bank capital was wiped out by inflation in 1922–23, and subsequent recapitalization efforts were wanting. Capital and reserves as a share of bank assets were now just 7 percent, barely a third of earlier levels.5 This was not as high as the leverage of the big German banks in 2009–10, whose capital ratios were as little as 2½ percent, but it was an extraordinary high level of leverage by interwar standards.

For their part, small German savers burned by the inflation were slow to return. To fund their operations, the banks therefore turned to foreign deposits, which they sought to attract with high interest rates. Big banks with internationally recognized names were in the best position to do so; by 1929 foreign accounts accounted for fully 40 percent of their deposit liabilities. The situation was not unlike that of the three big Icelandic banks in 2008. But, as in Iceland in 2008, the strategy laid the banks open to liquidity problems if foreign depositors chose to repatriate their funds. Worse still, the big banks, their profits weak, could ill afford to keep extra liquidity on hand.6

Given the fragility of the financial system, policies of budgetary austerity were, to put it mildly, problematic. Fiscal consolidation that reduced spending threatened to so weaken the banks that the economy would be launched on a downward spiral from which it would be impossible to recover.

Yet balance the budget, it was argued, the authorities must. State and municipal governments binged on cheap credit, just as Parker Gilbert had once warned, incurring heavy debts that now made it impossible for them, and the Reich government, to borrow.7 Germany’s creditors, and specifically the French, were in no mood to contemplate a reparations moratorium. Tampering with the gold parity, given recent inflationary history, was beyond the pale. Given this lack of alternatives, only the option of balancing the budget remained.

Agreeing on how to balance it was another matter. Social Democrats in the Reichstag objected to cuts in unemployment benefits, while the Bavarian People’s Party revolted over the government’s proposed tax on beer. The Grand Coalition, which was Germany’s last democratic gasp, collapsed in 1930 over its inability to square this circle.

The fall of the coalition led to the formation of a technocratic government under Heinrich Brüning. Brüning hailed from the city of Münster, the center of Kulturkampf, the struggle between the Catholic Church and Protestant Prussia. With the end of that conflict, it is said, the Catholic residents of Münster became “more Lutheran than thou.” A member of the Reichstag since 1924, Brüning had made his name as a financial expert, in the manner of Paul Ryan, and now set out to balance the budget by any means necessary. Lacking a coherent majority in the Reichstag, he resorted to the emergency powers provided for by Article 48 of the Weimar constitution. Those decree powers did not give the chancellor unchecked freedom of action—he still had to submit his decrees to the Reichstag for ex post approval—but they allowed him to set the budgetary agenda.

Seeing the deficit in the unemployment insurance fund as a major problem, Brüning issued decrees tightening eligibility requirements and reducing payments. He cut the salaries of public servants and reduced state and local government transfers. He decreed a range of new taxes, including one on mineral water, avoiding the need to tax beer.

But radical cuts in public spending in a period when private spending was collapsing had the predictable effect of worsening the slump. The other predictable effect was to weaken support for the government. A freakish alliance of Social Democrats and Nazis now refused to approve the chancellor’s decrees.

But Brüning was not one for changing his mind. He responded by dissolving the Reichstag and calling for new elections. To his surprise, voters repudiated his policies. The government took only a third of the seats in the new parliament, while the Communists, National Socialists, and other anti-system parties all gained. The Nazis alone saw a ninefold increase in representation. This was not the first time austerity and depression bred political extremism. Nor would it be the last.

This political backlash, according to Thomas Ferguson and Peter Temin, was what precipitated the German crisis.8 Brüning’s unrelenting austerity, by plunging the economy deeper into recession, increased political polarization. This unsettled investors, who, justifiably worried about what was next, fled in growing numbers.

The Reichsbank’s reserves fell sharply in September, with the approach of the election, and again in October, in its wake. The Reichsbank was forced to raise the discount rate by a full percentage point to defend the gold parity. This doing nothing to resolve the political crisis, investors were not reassured. Bank deposits continued to fall as money was spirited out of the country. The only surprise under the circumstances is that this was still just a bank jog rather than an all-out run.

The question, asked also of Southern European countries starting in 2010, was whether other options were available, and specifically if less austerity would have been better. The German historian Knut Borchardt argued that reckless borrowing had locked Germany out of the capital market, leaving no alternative to austerity.9 Ferguson and Temin conclude differently, saying that had Germany not been forced to endure such severe austerity, the political center could have held. The recession would have been milder, and reform might have proceeded. The government would have been able to regain market access and finance its deficits.

This seems naïve. In fact, market access was never an option for a Germany riven by political conflicts, burdened with crushing debts, and confronting a hostile France. The only way of financing budget deficits would have been by imposing exchange controls and requiring the banks to purchase the additional government bonds, as Hitler did in 1933. This volatile mix of economic depression, political polarization, weak finances, and a paralytic central bank was clearly poised to explode. The spark was the failure of the Creditanstalt, Austria’s largest bank.

Formally the Oesterreichische Credit-Anstalt für Handel und Gewerbe, or Austrian Credit Institution for Trade and Industry, the Creditanstalt had been founded by the Rothschilds in the 1860s. The majority of limited-liability companies in Austria did business with the bank. It accounted for more than 50 percent of all bank assets in the country and had a balance sheet of nearly 10 percent of GDP.10 In 1929 the Creditanstalt acquired its only consequential competitor, the Bodencreditanstalt, with extensive commitments to the textile industry.

This was not an asset portfolio likely to perform well in depressed conditions. Moreover, the Creditanstalt had little capacity to absorb losses. Management was extravagant in spending on premises. Like the big German banks, its buffer of capital was eroded by the inflation that followed World War I.11

And, like the big German banks, the Creditanstalt now relied for funding on foreigners. Attracted by high interest rates that the bank could ill afford, foreign individuals and institutions provided 35–40 percent of deposits and other credits. The obvious danger was that this form of finance would move out of the bank and out of the country at the first sign of trouble.

The Austrian government pressed for the Bodencreditanstalt merger, worried as much about the state of the textile industry as the stability of the Bodencreditanstalt itself. Having done the official sector’s bidding, the Creditanstalt’s top management now apparently believed they could count on government support.12 As the bank’s balance sheet deteriorated, their strategy was therefore to gamble for resurrection. Under the circumstances this meant making more loans to money-losing textile firms desperate to borrow to stay alive. It isn’t much of a stretch to see parallels with Lehman Brothers in 2008, from undercapitalization and reliance on risky funding sources to the bank’s desperate search for yield and the belief that it would be saved by the authorities if things went wrong.

Nor is it a stretch to see parallels in what happened when the Creditanstalt’s difficulties became public knowledge on May 11, 1931, as the bank published its balance sheet for 1930. The bank lost 16 percent of its deposits in the next two days and fully 30 percent in the subsequent two weeks.13

The Austrian government understood that the Creditanstalt was too big to fail. Unfortunately, it was also too big to save, with liabilities to foreigners only slightly less than the gold and foreign currency reserves of the central bank. If the Creditanstalt’s foreign depositors now sought to repatriate their money, the National Bank would be forced to pay out gold to satisfy their demands. It then would have no way of paying off the foreign liabilities of other banks also seeing panicked withdrawals, a phenomenon that started almost immediately on announcement of the Creditanstalt’s losses.

This liquidity problem could be solved only with help from a country having ample gold reserves. This meant France. But Austria had just signaled its intention of entering into a customs union agreement with Germany, in violation of the Versailles Treaty. The proposal was a brainchild of the German Foreign Office, which apparently saw an aggressive foreign policy as distracting the German public from mounting economic problems. It was not an offer that Austria, a small country on Germany’s flank, could easily refuse.14

In fact, the Creditanstalt crisis was more than a liquidity crisis, as Austrian officials preferred to characterize it. It reflected more than the central bank’s lack of the gold and foreign exchange to pay off foreign depositors. The Creditanstalt also had a solvency problem, having taken big losses on its loans to industry. Official denials to the contrary, it quickly became clear that the bank now needed not just temporary access to liquidity but an injection of share capital.

Aware of the importance of the bank to the Austrian economy, the government, headed by Chancellor Otto Ender, agreed to inject 100 million schillings (roughly $14 million), taking a 33 percent ownership stake in return.15 The problem was that it was not clear where it would come up with the money. The Depression had already reduced tax revenues and raised outlays on unemployment relief. The government had no financial reserves and no ability to borrow. Immediately on announcement of the capital injection, the price of government bonds collapsed. This was the “diabolic loop,” evident also in Greece, Spain, and Ireland starting in 2010, when problems for the banks created problems for the public finances, which in turn deepened worries over the banks.

After three weeks of difficult negotiations spanning much of the month of May, the Austrian government was able to arrange a 100-million-schilling loan from eleven countries. Funds were channeled through the Bank for International Settlements, the latter just having been established, with impeccable timing, to handle reparations transfers. But the loan was only half of what had been requested by the Austrian government. It was enough to finance the injection of capital into the Creditanstalt but left no margin for further losses.

Meanwhile, reserves continued to drain from the National Bank, as anxious foreign investors sought to get their money out of schillings and out of the country. The main impact of the loan was thus to finance capital flight, as the additional resources injected into the Creditanstalt were withdrawn first by foreign financial institutions and next by Austrian depositors, who then asked the central bank to convert their schillings into gold.16

The Austrian authorities responded in the only way they knew how, by requesting another foreign loan. The lenders, having learned their lesson, this time demanded as a condition that the Creditanstalt’s creditors in Berlin, Paris, London, and New York first agree to maintain their balances in Vienna, so that the official money injected into Austria didn’t just leak back out. As a further condition, they demanded that the Austrian government guarantee the loan, the earlier loan having technically been to the central bank, not the state. Least reasonably from the Austrian point of view, the French government demanded that Austria abandon the customs union proposal, submit its finances to League of Nations control, and renounce “any steps which might modify the existing political and economic relations of Austria.”

In effect, the country was being asked to surrender its sovereignty. The National Bank was scheduled to release new figures for its foreign reserves on Wednesday, June 17. When tabling these demands the preceding day, French officials evidently believed that they had the Austrian government over a barrel.

These French demands were more than the Ender government could bear. It resigned on June 16 on receiving the French government’s note. The Bank of England stepped in with a temporary credit, but it was too late. At this point the only alternative to closing the bank was to negotiate an agreement with its London-based creditors, now organized as the Austrian Credit-Anstalt International Committee, committing the latter to not make further withdrawals. The price was steep. In return for a two-year standstill on withdrawals, the successor to the Ender government, led by Karl Buresch, was required to guarantee the banks’ liabilities in full. A federal government with a budget of only 1,800 million schillings ($250 million) was on the hook for 1,200 million schillings of bank liabilities.17 Shades of Ireland in 2008.

The guarantee did nothing to restore confidence in the financial system; it was just the diabolic loop all over again. And the standstill agreement cast a pall over the position of financial institutions in still other countries whose assets in Austria were frozen. If policy makers had been seeking to spread the crisis to other countries, they couldn’t have done a better job. German investors, their Austrian balances frozen, scrambled for liquidity, drawing down their deposits in other banks and liquidating other investments. The process was aptly described by the financial journalist Harry Hodson in terms that could be applied equally to the Lehman Brothers crisis: “An individual bank, or the banking system of a country or of the world as a whole, has to remain liquid or perish. If one item among its assets, which had been regarded as liquid, becomes unrealizable for the time being, it must improve its position of liquidity by realizing other assets.”18 In this way the crisis spread to Germany.

Moreover, there was the close family resemblance between the Creditanstalt and the third-largest German bank, Danatbank (formally, Darmstädter und Nationalbank). Like the Creditanstalt, Danatbank was known for its large commitments to industry. Its general partner, Jakob Goldschmidt, was widely viewed as a risk taker. Hjalmar Schacht, in a passage in his memoirs not entirely free of ethnic stereotyping, describes Goldschmidt as competitive “verg[ing] on the ruthless.”19 As Schacht put it, Goldschmidt’s aggressive pursuit of business did not exactly endear him to his colleagues.

Among Goldschmidt’s favorite tactics was to instigate and execute amalgamations of firms in sectors with excess capacity, in the style of Charles Hatry. His Danatbank had extensive commitments to the textile sector. Now there were unsettling rumors that one of Danatbank’s textile-industry clients, the Bremen-based Nordwalle (formally the Norddeutsche Wollkämmerei und Kammgarnspinnerei), had inexplicably gambled on a rise in wool prices and was in perilous shape.

Goldschmidt learned of Nordwalle’s problems on May 11, the same day the Creditanstalt’s difficulties were announced. And what Goldschmidt knew quickly became public knowledge. Sentiment deteriorated further when it was learned that Nordwalle’s speculation in wool had been conducted through a Dutch subsidiary, Ultra Mare, whose existence was unknown even to outside members of Nordwalle’s board, which for better or worse included representatives of the banks. The Lahusen brothers, Karl and Heinz, Nordwalle’s co-CEOs, repeatedly doubled down on their disastrous bets, borrowing additional funds from Danatbank and other sources to finance their gamble to survive. Observers quickly began to ask whether the same problems hiding in the ledgers of Danatbank might also be lurking in those of other banks with extensive commitments to industry. This, moreover, was not the only weakness afflicting the banking system. Had the problem just been bad loans to industry, German investors would have been first to withdraw their funds. Residents were presumably best informed about the condition of German industry and thus of the banks. In fact, however, it was foreign investors who were first to run. There was no noticeable increase in currency in circulation—no sign that residents were shifting to currency from deposits. There was, however, a marked decline in the Reichsbank’s gold and foreign exchange reserves in the final week in May. This then accelerated in the first half of June, suggesting that foreigners were actively repatriating their funds.

The foreigners in question were unsettled by Chancellor Brüning’s not very lightly veiled threats about halting reparations payments.20 The onset of the Depression did not make the reparations burden any more tolerable. Brüning’s truculence was designed to compensate for the unpopularity of his economic policies. He pushed ahead with rearmament, building pocket battleships in violation of the Versailles Treaty. In March 1931 he embraced the ill-fated Foreign Office proposal for customs union with Austria. On June 6, in conjunction with a second round of decrees cutting public-sector salaries and unemployment benefits, he warned that the economy was on the verge of collapse. The implication was that if conditions deteriorated further there might be no alternative to a reparations moratorium.

A reparations moratorium would almost certainly presage a wider moratorium, extending also to private debts. Realizing this, foreign investors rushed to withdraw their remaining funds. On June 13 the Reichsbank responded by raising the discount rate by a bazookalike two hundred basis points. But this did little to reassure foreign investors worried that they might lose all access to their German deposits. Nor could it have reassured anyone aware of the perilous state of the German economy. Brüning was not the only one contemplating a reparations moratorium. President Hoover, seeing conditions in Germany as a threat to the US economy and aware that the election determining whether he served a second term was only eighteen months away, had been toying with the idea since May.21 In June he set about campaigning for the support of Secretary Mellon, Governor Harrison, and Eugene Meyer, who chaired the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve System. Meyer, an ambitious, blunt-spoken Californian, had attended the University of California, Berkeley and Yale. He made his fortune as a speculator in railway shares, leveraging the $100 “nonsmoking fund” that his father offered him if he agreed not to smoke until he was eighteen and then the additional $500 if he agreed not to smoke until he was twenty-one. During World War I he directed the War Finance Corporation (WFC), created to finance essential industries, including banks and railroads jeopardized by wartime dislocations. He then went on to head the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (essentially a repurposed version of the WFC) and, eventually, to purchase the Washington Post and serve as the first president of the World Bank.22 Meyer later claimed that he and not the president had originated the idea of a reparations moratorium, although Hoover claimed the credit in his autobiography, to the chagrin of Meyer, who was later to remark that Hoover’s memoirs should have been entitled “Alone in Washington.”23

Hoover announced his one-year moratorium proposal on June 20. The initiative was received unhappily in Paris, the State Department having failed to alert the French in advance. Pierre Laval, newly installed as prime minister, summoned the American ambassador to complain about the president’s “shock tactics.” Hoover was not pleased; in his view the French were all too complacent. “Our French friends need to get a stronger taste of Depression,” he is reported to have remarked. Unlike in 1923, however, France was in no position to send troops to enforce its claims.24

In contrast to the politicians in Paris, investors reacted positively. Stock and commodity markets rallied on announcement of the moratorium proposal. Unfortunately, the three-week delay in finalizing the agreement largely neutralized those confidence-enhancing effects. Investors realized that a moratorium on reparations payments, by itself, would not be enough to relieve the pressure on the Reichsbank, whose gold reserves had already fallen to the legal minimum. Luther and the board of the central bank could defend the gold standard by restricting credit, or they could support the banks by discounting freely. They could not do both, at least not without help from a foreign loan.

On the same day Hoover announced his moratorium, Luther obtained a modest $100 million credit from the Bank of England, the Bank of France, the Federal Reserve, and the Bank for International Settlements. The loan was just enough to balance the Reichsbank’s books and make it look as if its gold reserves were still adequate. But this was not the shock and awe needed to restore confidence. Gold losses resumed within days. On June 22, again to prevent the Reichsbank’s gold reserve from falling below the legal minimum, Luther was forced to announce fresh restrictions on its discounts of private paper. With the central bank now limiting the availability of credit, industrial production fell further.

On July 2 news of the crisis at Nordwalle and Danatbank hit the stands. The Reichsbank announced its intention of supporting Danatbank, but limited reserves prevented it from following through. On July 5, with the central bank’s gold cover ratio below the statutory minimum of 40 percent, it withdrew support. Luther justified the action by citing the inadequacy of Danatbank’s collateral, anticipating language to which central bankers would again resort three-quarters of a century later in connection with Lehman Brothers.

On Thursday, July 9, a desperate Luther flew off to London, Paris, and Basel, the latter being the home of the Bank for International Settlements. Luther can be criticized for many things, notably his role in the hyperinflation and support for Hitler, but he was a pioneer of shuttle diplomacy. Not even an airplane, however, could win this war. Luther’s meeting with Norman, at Victoria Station, where the English central banker was preparing to board a train to Dover, was tense. Norman was not on such friendly terms with Luther as he had been with Schacht. Personalities aside, Norman worried that the Reichsbank would be in no position to pay back what it borrowed. He was not prepared to move without guarantees from the German government and the participation of France.

But pocket battleships and the Austro-German customs union left the French unsympathetic. They demanded that Germany drop its customs union proposal, commit to full resumption of reparations payments, and renounce rearmament spending as a precondition for assistance. For Brüning, who had staked himself to an aggressive foreign policy, this was impossible.25 The chancellor now dismissed Luther’s trip as a “fiasco.” The exhausted central banker flew home empty-handed.

In Luther’s absence, representatives of the major German financial insti­ tutions continued to meet at the offices of Deutsche Bank und DiscontoGesellschaft, the country’s biggest bank. The government organized the parlay in the hope that other banks might be induced to inject funds into Danatbank in return for some of its remaining assets. But the banks refused to be corralled. It did not help that Danatbank’s books were opaque. Like those of the Bank of United States, they could not be sorted out over a weekend. Moreover, there was good reason to fear that Danatbank’s losses might turn out to be greater than acknowledged previously. Nor did it help that Danatbank, like the Bank of United States, was run by a Jewish senior partner for whom his fellow bankers felt less than full sympathy.

Luther cabled George Harrison in New York, pleading for a credit. Though sympathetic, Harrison was not prepared to move without the participation of the Bank of England and Bank of France. In 2008, the Federal Reserve offered to provide loans of dollars to the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. Technically, it swapped them US dollars in exchange for commensurate amounts of their respective currencies, enabling these other central banks to supply their own banks and firms dollars with which to repay their borrowings. The Bernanke Fed provided a quartet of $30 billion loans to the central banks of Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, and Singapore. The course of the 1931 financial crisis might have been quite different had the New York Fed, likewise, acted on Luther’s request. But the Reichsbank’s capacity to repay what it borrowed was uncertain. Harrison had been stung by the criticism directed at the New York Fed when Strong tailored policy to foreign needs in 1924 and 1927. And it is not clear that Harrison would have now had the full support of the Federal Reserve Board. Better, under the circumstances, to share the burden with the Bank of England and Bank of France. Unfortunately, burden sharing was easier to imagine than to arrange.

Emergency meetings at the Reichsbank continued fruitlessly through the weekend. At 3:00 a.m. Monday morning, July 13, the sleepless Luther again left for the airport and a breakfast meeting with Norman, who had now arrived in Basel, and Clement Moret of the Bank of France. The three central bankers having failed to reach an agreement by 9:00 a.m., Danatbank did not open its doors.

Other German banks immediately suffered heavy withdrawals. On Monday night, seeing no alternative, the Reich government declared a two-day bank holiday. Officials again asked the other big banks to guarantee Danatbank’s liabilities, and again they refused. This forced the authorities to extend a public guarantee, which only deepened concern with the government’s finances. This was the diabolic loop yet again, as the need for governments to guarantee the liabilities of the banks so damaged confidence in the official sector’s own balance sheet that the security of the guarantee was cast into doubt.26

When the banks reopened on Thursday, withdrawals were limited to half of the account holder’s balance or ten thousand marks (the equivalent of $2,350), whichever was less. Funds could be transferred between German banks, but not abroad. The Reichsbank limited the availability of foreign exchange to “cases of vital necessity,” reserving the right of defining vital necessity for itself.27 The worst fear of investors, that their formerly liquid funds in Germany would be rendered unavailable as a result of government action, came to pass. Having failed to organize collective support by other banks and equally to obtain adequate support from its foreign counterparts, the Reichsbank was left with no choice. In an atmosphere poisoned by mutual distrust, banks and governments sleepwalked together into disaster.
