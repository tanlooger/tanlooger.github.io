title: Chapter 11 Largely Contained
---



Home prices peaked in the United States at the end of 2005 and the beginning of 2006. Having risen for the better part of a decade, they fell by 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005 and 3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2006. The 1 percent fall at the end of 2005 could be dismissed as a fluke, the difficulty of identifying comparable sales rendering all indices of property prices less than precise. But two consecutive quarters of declining prices and a cumulative fall of more than 4 percent were harder to ignore.1

Already contrarian investors were starting to bet on further declines in the housing market. John Paulson, a merger-arbitrage expert best known for his lavish parties, began buying credit default swaps that would pay out in the event of defaults on subprime mortgage pools. Jeff Greene, a failed Los Angeles real estate speculator, learned of Paulson’s strategy and replicated his trade. Andrew Lahde, a freelance hedge fund trader with a background as a Southern California beachcomber, followed a similar strategy on a smaller scale. Michael Burry, a small-time fund manager whose training was as a physician, did the same out of San Jose.2

These contrarians were outsiders. That many of them worked not on Wall Street but in California is revealing. They were not part of the Wall Street machinery. They were not prone to having their views shaped by colleagues enjoying big paydays from the securitization business.

But given their status as outsiders, it was easy to dismiss their nettlesome views. The dominant strategy within the investment banking community remained taking on additional mortgage-related risk because other institutions were taking on additional mortgage-related risk. Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, and Merrill Lynch all continued to increase their 分页。。。mortgage-related exposures in 2006 because they saw their rivals doing likewise. This was groupthink at its best. Dissidents suggesting otherwise were banished from the inner sanctum. Such was the fate of Madeline Antoncic, Lehman’s chief risk officer, who as recently as 2005 had been singled out as “Risk Manager of the Year” by Risk Magazine, the semi-official organ of the risk-management industry.3

A few individuals and institutions endowed with exceptional intellectual flexibility and not overly burdened by scruples were able to play both sides of the fence. Goldman Sachs continued to distribute collateralized debt obligations backed by pools of mortgages, earning handsome fees. Yet even while it marketed those securities the firm was betting against them in its trading operations. The bank’s own positions—that instead of investing in the securities in question, it borrowed and sold them in the expectation that their prices would fall—indicate it did not believe the senior tranches of those CDOs deserved their AAA ratings. But if so, Goldman did not feel obliged as investment advisor to warn its clients, whether they were the German bank IKB, the Australian hedge fund Basis Yield Alpha (Master), or Bear Stearns Asset Management. These counterparties, Goldman argued, were “sophisticated investors.” They could take care of themselves. Meanwhile, the truly sophisticated investors like Goldman were reducing their exposure to mortgage-related risk.4 By the fourth quarter of 2007, the cumulative fall in home prices had reached 9 percent.5 High loan-to-value mortgages with rates that reset after a grace period were sold to households in the expectation that home values would continue to rise. Not a few borrowers purchased more house than they could afford in anticipation of flipping it before the interest rate recast.6 This strategy no longer being viable in a falling market, they defaulted in growing numbers.

As new mortgages became harder to originate, brokers also experienced distress. Ameriquest, the single largest subprime lender as recently as 2005, closed all but four of its retail branches and eliminated four thousand jobs. Ownit Mortgage Solutions became the first subprime lender to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, in January 2007. American Freedom Mortgage, American Home Mortgage, and then New Century Financial followed in turn.

It was clear by this time that the housing sector was on the cusp of a wrenching adjustment. What was not clear was the powerful negative impact this would have on the economy. Everyone understood that home prices had stopped rising, but there was little awareness of broader consequences. Expert commentary suggested that the impact would be restricted to the housing market, and its subprime segment in particular. The implications for the economy, the financial system, and the labor market would be limited, it was comfortingly asserted. Fed Chairman Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson used strikingly similar language when seeking to characterize the consequences. “The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime markets seems likely to be contained,” Bernanke testified in March 2007.7 In a speech to a business group a month later, Paulson reassured his audience that although “we’ve clearly had a big correction in the housing market . . . I don’t see [problems in the subprime mortgage market] imposing a serious problem. I think it’s going to be largely contained.”8

Officials see it as their role to reassure. But the absence in the first half of 2007 of policy action to support the slowing economy suggests that policy makers believed what they said.9

A confluence of factors lay behind this collective failure of imagination. To start, there was an inability to imagine how fast and far home prices could fall. There might be sharp declines in certain regional markets, as happened in Florida in 1926 and might now occur in the Inland Empire of Southern California, but not in the country as a whole. “We’ve never had a decline on a nationwide basis,” Bernanke observed. “What I think is more likely is that house prices will slow, maybe stabilize, might slow consumption spending a bit. I don’t think it’s going to drive the economy too far from its full employment path, though.”10 When home prices did start falling nationwide, Secretary Paulson was quick to conclude that they were “at or near the bottom.” This kind of nationwide fall was an aberration, at most a one-time adjustment, not an ongoing trend.11 These statements were not just for public consumption; they were indicative of the consensus in official circles. The March 2007 minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, for example, spoke of how “accumulating data suggested that the demand for homes was leveling out.”12

The mistaken belief that home prices could not fall on a nationwide basis was, of course, what a historical perspective like that brought by a scholar of the Great Depression such as Chairman Bernanke should have served to correct. Home prices had dropped by 25 percent in nominal terms between 1929 and 1933, and by fully 30 percent from their peak in 1925. They had dropped nationwide. As an expert on the Great Depression, the chairman was surely aware of the fact.

The assumption behind his “We’ve never had” statement was that the earlier decline in housing prices, like the decline in the overall price level, was possible only because the recently created central bank had neglected its responsibilities. It was not possible now that seasoned monetary policy makers were on the job. This assumption in turn reflected the intellectual sway of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz’s interpretation of the Great Depression, according to which an inexperienced Fed was responsible for the collapse of output and prices. It reflected the further belief that modern central bankers had assimilated Friedman and Schwartz’s analysis. There is no better expression of the view than the remarks addressed by Governor Bernanke to Professor Friedman in 2002, on the occasion of the latter’s ninetieth birthday: “Regarding the Great Depression. You’re right, we did it. We’re very sorry. But thanks to you, we won’t do it again.”13

This was of course simply the policy community’s collective belief in the Great Moderation in another guise. Because central bankers had learned the lessons of history, they would avoid the mistakes that caused sharp drops in housing prices and the economywide price level starting in 1929. Instead they would take proactive steps to ensure that the incipient decline was contained. And if the aggregate price level and economic activity were stabilized, any nationwide fall in housing prices would be limited.

When it became clear in 2007 that a significant decline in home prices was in fact underway, it was still possible to argue that the financial system would not be implicated. When property prices fell in 1926, only a few isolated bank runs and bank failures followed. The impact on the financial system was limited and mild. This was not the case in 1933, admittedly, when nonperforming mortgage loans brought down the Guardian Group of banks and helped precipitate a full-blown panic. But the circumstances then were different. Retail depositors, fearing for their savings, ran at the first sign of trouble. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation now guaranteed deposits up to $100,000. The kind of panicked runs affecting the Caldwell chain of banks in 1930, Charles Dawes’ Central Republic Trust in 1932, and Henry Ford’s Guardian Group in 1933 were no longer possible. Or so it was thought.

By early 1933, moreover, the contraction had been underway for more than three years. Unemployment exceeded 20 percent. Widespread mortgage defaults threatened the stability of any financial institution with exposure to the housing market. In 2007, in contrast, the economy was continuing to expand. Unemployment was still below 5 percent. So long as the expansion persisted, it was possible to argue that the majority of borrowers would be all right, along with the majority of financial institutions. And even when the expansion ended, as all expansions do, there was still that experienced central bank to prevent events from spiraling out of control.

The financial system, moreover, had come a long way since 1933. Banks had strengthened their controls. They possessed a cornucopia of instruments with which to hedge and diversify risk. In an October 2005 speech, Alan Greenspan, who more than anyone epitomized this supposed wisdom, acknowledged that the current expansion, like all expansions, would ultimately end but reassured his audience that the US and world economies, and their financial systems, were more resilient than ever.14

What this reassuring, and in retrospect curiously one-eyed, assessment missed was the structure of housing finance. Even limited declines in housing prices could now disrupt the mortgage market because of how lending was structured. And the impact of worsening mortgage-market conditions could have much graver implications for the financial system because of the increase in leverage and the development of a shadow banking system subject to minimal regulation. Those implications would be especially serious for banks that warehoused collateralized debt obligations in the vain hope of selling them, for special purpose vehicles that loaded up on the speculative equity tranche in ignorance of the risk, and for bond insurers and credit default swap specialists like American International Group that sold insurance on those contracts. And if markets in CDOs and CDS were disrupted, the appetite for subprime and even conventional mortgages could dry up, feeding back on the housing market. There would then be spillovers to the commercial paper market, money market mutual funds, the banking system, and ultimately the economy itself.

Unfortunately, this alphabet soup of CDOs, SPVs, and CDS was not part of the staple diet of erstwhile Princeton professors of economics. Nor were these complex financial structures incorporated into the Federal Reserve’s model of the economy. Fed staffers were more likely to have graduated from university departments of economics than investment bank trading floors. Only a handful had even heard of collateralized debt obligations. It is thus unsurprising that they failed to sound louder warnings. The shock, as in 1929, came from outside the banking system. In June 2007, Bear Stearns announced that it was halting redemptions from two hedge funds heavily invested in CDOs. By the end of May, the more aggressively managed of the two vehicles, the tongue-twistingly named High Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund, had received redemption requests from roughly half its account holders. These were not demands that the fund could meet, given that there was now no market for its assets and no other way of raising cash. Bear had marketed the funds as low-risk vehicles invested in AA and AAA securities. The rating agencies that helped to structure those securities had compliantly bestowed the requisite AA and AAA ratings.15 Thus, the lock-up was a shock not just to investors in the two Bear Stearns funds but also to investors in other funds with positions in what were similarly supposed to be high-grade, low-risk securities but were now revealed as anything but.

Leverage too played a role, as in 1929. The Bear Stearns funds had used their collateral and their parent’s good name to borrow from other financial firms. Though the difference between the cost of borrowing and the return on AA and AAA-rated securities was small, multiplied many times it could still promise a healthy return on equity. This made leveraging the portfolio an attractive, and indeed an essential, part of the strategy.

But leverage could pose an existential threat if the investments in question went bad. If big lenders like Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs refused to roll over their loans, it was not clear where else the borrowers could turn. If those companies then moved to seize the collateral the borrowers had pledged, it would quickly become apparent that there was not enough to go around. There would be a rush to seize the remaining assets, and the borrowers would be thrust into bankruptcy, creating significant losses for the lenders. Better was to gradually wind down the two Bear Stearns funds. Their assets could be sold off in an orderly fashion to maximize the recovery rate rather than being dumped on the market in a fire sale.16

But doing so required patience, something that was in short supply. In addition, there was the uncomfortable fact that Bear Stearns, with a reputation for hard-nosed business practices, was the one Wall Street firm that refused to contribute to the collective rescue of the mega-hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. As a consequence, Bear was not now the recipient of much goodwill from the financial community.

On June 20 Merrill Lynch, preoccupied by its own problems, seized $850 million of collateral from Bear Stearns. Learning of Merrill’s action, Lehman Brothers quickly followed. Bear put up $1.6 billion of its own funds to keep the two funds afloat but quickly concluded that it was facing a bottomless pit.17 On July 31 it requested bankruptcy protection for its troubled funds. Bear Stearns was out the $1.6 billion, causing investors to question whether its top officers in fact deserved their reputation for hard-headed, cigar-chomping management.

The lesson was as alarming as it was clear. Deposit insurance may have eliminated runs on commercial banks by retail depositors, but it had not eliminated runs by wholesale lenders on the shadow banking system of which the two Bear Stearns funds were part. Nor, when the time came, would it prevent runs on their parent institutions. As in the 1920s, a shock that originated in the United States quickly infected other countries. In the 1920s US banks lent to European banks and governments, which invested the money in illiquid assets like municipal swimming pools (illiquid in the financial sense of the word). When US lending dried up, the European borrowers were unable to continue funding those projects, much less repay what they borrowed. This time, European banks again funded illiquid investments by borrowing dollars from their American counterparts. As US banks incurred losses on their housing-related investments, their foreign lending again dried up, placing the European borrowers in a 1920s-like bind.

And this was not all. In the 1920s some European borrowers turned around and invested their dollars in an ever wobblier US stock market. This time, again, European banks turned around and invested their borrowed funds in the United States, including in the questionable CDOs distributed by those same US banks.

Banks in the United States, like Goldman Sachs, may have developed reservations about the subprime-linked CDO market by late 2006, but the same was not true of the Düsseldorf-based IKB or France’s BNP Paribas. IKB, or the Bank for German Industry Obligations (Bank für deutsche Industrieobligationen), was founded in 1924 to supply funds to cash-strapped German firms in the wake of the hyperinflation. In addition to lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, IKB found its way into real estate lending.18

But given its mandate to provide finance to the German economy, it was not at all clear just why the bank now saw fit to invest in securities backed by US subprime mortgages. Why its managers thought they were capable of navigating those treacherous shoals is even less obvious. Actually, it was obvious to IKB’s ambitious CEO Stefan Ortseifen, who saw doing so as a way of transforming a medium-sized bank that specialized in lending to medium-sized companies into a global player. To that end, Ortseifen created an off-balance-sheet company, Rhineland Funding, and listed it on a compliant Irish stock market. As a special purpose vehicle, Rhineland didn’t have to hold capital against its investments, in turn allowing IKB to lever up its bets. This was a classic 2000s financial play. It now came back to bite the bank.

The biggest single bite came in the form of the Abacus deal that eventually became the subject of congressional hearings and a Justice Department investigation.19 This brings us back to John Paulson. In late 2006 Paulson decided to place big bets against the housing market. Paulson was a mergers-and-acquisitions specialist at Bear Stearns who went on to found a hedge fund specializing in the debt of troubled companies. He was not a housing specialist, which may have been what enabled him to go against the grain. Nor did Paulson require sophisticated evidence to reach his contrarian conclusions. He saw home prices rising in his Southampton, New York, neighborhood. One of his analysts thought to gather data on home prices going back to 1975, leading to the hallelujah moment when Paulson saw that inflation-adjusted prices nationwide had risen faster after 2000 than before.

These were thin reeds on which to rest big bets. But big bets against subprime-linked securities were what Paulson now placed. He sought to borrow the securities in question and sell them, in the expectation that he could buy them back at lower prices in the not-too-distant future.

One indication of the size of those bets was the difficulty Paulson had in finding toxic securities to borrow in the requisite amounts. Easier, he concluded, was to create them. If those dubious securities could then be successfully sold to other investors, Paulson could borrow and sell them in anticipation of the subsequent price decline.

This was the effort in which he now enlisted Goldman Sachs. With Goldman’s help, Paulson selected the mortgage-backed securities to which his tailor-made CDO would be linked. He rejected mortgages originated by well-known banks like Wells Fargo in favor of those of dubious entities like First Franklin Bank of California. Down payments on First Franklin mortgages averaged a paltry 7 percent. Thirty-seven percent of its mortgages were interest-only loans; the homeowner’s payments were limited to interest in the initial years but then required balloon payments of principal down the road. Many featured loan-to-value ratios in excess of 100 percent, meaning the loan was more than the price of the property.

These were the mortgages most at risk now that the market had turned down. Hence the CDOs they backed were most likely to decline in price. They were the perfect securities for Paulson to borrow and sell, given his negative outlook on the housing market.

Paulson paid Goldman Sachs a cool $15 million for the privilege of attaching the bank’s name to the resulting CDO. Specifically Goldman attached the Abacus name, Abacus being one of the first CDO programs the bank had launched in 2004 and one in which IKB had already invested. An abacus is, of course, a device intended to help the user add and subtract. IKB, it turned out, needed all the help it could get.

The German bank appears to have been aware of the possibility of conflict of interest. It informed Goldman Sachs that it would buy additional mortgage-linked CDOs only if Goldman arranged for a third party to co-manage the deal. Goldman brought in ACA Management, a CDO specialist, to double-check Paulson’s arithmetic. It seems unlikely that this particular firm was chosen at random. ACA’s parent, the ACA Financial Guaranty Group, had only a single-A rating from Standard & Poor’s, rendering its bond insurance products uncompetitive. ACA, in other words, was desperate for business. And business was what Abacus offered.20

ACA met with Paulson & Co. and with Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman vice president in charge, in January 2007. Its analysts approved 55 of 123 mortgage pools submitted by Paulson, took the fees and lent its imprimatur. But it did not obviously understand the deal or Paulson’s plan of betting against it, since ACA purchased $42 million of Abacus securities for its own account and issued credit default swaps guaranteeing nearly $1 billion of the senior tranche.21

IKB bought $150 million of notes when the deal, known as Abacus 2007-AC1, closed in April 2007. As an employee of Paulson & Co. put it in an internal email, banks like IKB had “neither the analytical tools nor the institutional framework” necessary to dive into the deep end of this particular pool.22 With subprime mortgage defaults rising, the timing could not have been worse.23 By early 2008, 100 percent of the bonds selected for Abacus 2007-AC1 had been downgraded, making it the worst-performing synthetic mortgage-related deal in history—a record that will stand forever given the impossibility of a downgrade rate greater than 100 percent. Within two years, half of the 500,000 mortgage loans backing the deal were in default or foreclosure. This testifies to Paulson’s efficiency in selecting the mortgage pool. The $15 billion his firm cleared testifies to this even more powerfully.

By July 30, barely three months after Abacus 2007-AC1 closed, IKB was forced to restate its financials. It had financed its investments by issuing commercial paper backed by other assets. In a pattern that would be repeated more than once, it now lost access to this market and had to be bailed out by its creditors and the German government. Two other regional Landesbanken, Saxony-based Sachsen LB and the North Rhine–Westphalian state bank West LB, followed it down. In an ironic twist, IKB was eventually sold for pennies on the dollar to the US-based private equity shop Lone Star Funds. Just ten days earlier, in releasing its quarterly financials, IKB had asserted that it would not be affected by mortgage losses in the United States. The obvious question, now that this claim was shown to be false, was whether similar problems lurked in the balance sheets of other banks. The financial crisis featured many misstatements, but few as glaring as Standard & Poor’s response to the IKB announcement. On the day the bank restated its financials, Stefan Best, lead analyst of European banks for the rating agency, reassured a reporter that there was little reason to worry about other financial institutions. “So far the banks feel pretty comfortable,” Mr. Best observed. “There is a pretty high threshold before they would take a hit.”24

Anyone inclined to accept Best’s prognosis was disabused of the notion when the French megabank BNP Paribas revealed that it too had incurred significant losses on subprime-related investments. Shortly before the markets opened on Monday, August 9, BNP announced it was suspending three in-house hedge funds because of problems with their holdings of US mortgage securities. Observers were startled to learn that the three funds, thought to be invested in euro-denominated money market instruments, were in fact heavily exposed to American subprime risk. BNP sought to calm its clients by blaming the funds’ difficulties on exceptional liquidity problems and insisting they would recover when the markets normalized. More than 90 percent of the securities held by the three funds were rated AAA or AA, the firm’s CEO, Baudouin Prot, reassuringly noted. It did not go unnoticed that this was the same reassurance Bear Stearns had provided just prior to suspending its two in-house funds.25

Not all financial crises have a definitive starting date, but this one clearly did. The 2007 crisis can be said to have erupted on August 9, the day of the BNP Paribas announcement. Realizing that if this land mine could have been hiding in BNP’s financials it could be hiding anywhere, banks abruptly stopped lending to one another. The interbank market, on which banks trade liquidity overnight, seized up starting in Europe. Interbank rates tend to track the rate banks pay when borrowing money from the central bank, since central bank loans and interbank loans are close substitutes under normal circumstances.26 But circumstances now were anything but normal. On August 9 interbank rates soared far above the ECB’s target.

As yet, there were still no panicked depositors lining up outside European banks. But the collapse of the interbank market still threatened a crisis of the first order. European banks, recall, were even more leveraged than their American counterparts. They relied less on retail deposits and more on funds borrowed from other banks. Their distress was immediate and severe.

This finally was enough to galvanize a soporific European Central Bank into action. As recently as July 3, oblivious to the risk of a liquidity shortage, the ECB had raised interest rates. Liquidity, according to the presumption in Frankfurt, was an American problem. The BNP Paribas event at least had the salutary effect of shattering this illusion. At 10:26 a.m. Central European Time on August 9, less than ninety minutes after the start of trading, the ECB announced that it was ready to act. Two hours later it released a statement affirming its readiness to provide not just liquidity but unlimited amounts of liquidity.27 The Fed may have provided liquidity to banks lending to distressed brokers and dealers following the Crash in 1929, but it had never made this kind of open-ended commitment. Even in Frankfurt they had evidently read Friedman and Schwartz. This was just the kind of crisis that, as an economic historian, Chairman Bernanke had been studying for years. As the sun rose on Washington, D.C., the Fed injected $24 billion into US financial markets. In a press release issued the next day it affirmed its readiness to supply as many dollars as the markets required. “The Federal Reserve will provide reserves as necessary through open market operations,” the central bank averred. “As always, the discount window is available as a source of funding.” The Fed lent an additional $38 billion on August 10, coordinating the action with similar steps by the ECB and the central banks of Japan, Canada, Australia, and Hong Kong.

This, it could be argued, was exactly the response recommended by Friedman and Schwartz. The only problem was that this was no longer your mother’s, or Friedman and Schwartz’s, banking crisis. Central banks are in the business of lending to commercial banks. But this crisis, unlike that of 1930–1933, was not centered on commercial banks. Rather it centered, at least for the moment, on the shadow banking system of hedge funds, money market mutual funds, and commercial paper issuers, which were not the Fed’s regular counterparties. This in turn meant that central bank interventions were less effective than supposed.

First to be infected were the hedge funds. Funds thought to be exposed to US mortgage risk suffered massive withdrawals, often by other funds. They were unable to obtain lines of credit, irrespective of whether the Fed provided banks with liquidity, because banks refused to lend. Fund managers dumped mortgage-related securities in response, creating losses for other fund managers. These were not problems that either federal deposit insurance or central bank lending to commercial banks could address.

Next to be infected was the market in asset-backed commercial paper. Large companies extending student loans and car loans and having credit-card and trade receivables customarily bundle them together and borrow against them for 90 to 180 days. Selling the resulting securities, known as asset-backed commercial paper, allows them to meet their expenses without having to wait for collections on the underlying assets. It is hard to overstate the importance of asset-backed commercial paper as a funding source for US banks and firms. As of August 2007, as much as $1.2 trillion worth of asset-backed commercial paper was outstanding. To put the figure in context, this was more than the value of all outstanding US treasury bills.28 Revealingly, the stock of asset-backed commercial paper had almost doubled in the preceding eighteen months. Supplies could have risen so rapidly, suddenly risk-conscious investors realized, only at the expense of credit quality. Mortgages and mortgage-related derivatives, they discovered to their horror, figured disproportionately among the assets backing recent commercial paper issues. This shouldn’t have been a surprise, of course, since specialized mortgage originators like Countrywide Financial had long been among the principal issuers.29

Issuers of asset-backed commercial paper, like banks, were in the business of issuing liquid short-term debt to finance illiquid investments. Consequently, when investors pulled the plug, the result was not unlike a slow-motion bank run. In July 2007 only 5 percent of issuers had been unable to roll over their outstanding commercial paper when it matured. By the end of August this fraction was up to 25 percent. By the end of November it was 40 percent.30 This run on the commercial paper market, like the run on the hedge funds, was a phenomenon to which the provision of federal deposit insurance was, at best, irrelevant.31

The liquidity crisis sparked by the collapse of the commercial paper market quickly infected the corporate and financial sectors. Countrywide Financial, now holding the poisoned chalice as the nation’s largest mortgage lender, averted bankruptcy only by arranging a costly $11.5 billion credit line from a consortium of banks. Ameriquest, once the largest US subprime specialist, was forced to wind down its remaining operations. The next domino to fall was the British building society Northern Rock. The Rock, as it liked to be called to indicate its solidity, was an amalgam of two venerable Newcastle building societies, the Northern Counties Permanent Building Society and the Rock Building Society, which dated from the nineteenth century. A building society is the British equivalent of a credit union, a cooperative financial institution owned and operated by its members. The species acquired its name from having been founded by workers in the building trades. Building societies tend to specialize in mortgage lending. Northern Rock was one of the larger and, for many years, more successful examples of the type.

But rapid expansion of the sort to which its executives aspired could not be financed by members’ subscriptions alone. Northern Rock first sought to acquire other building societies. This being inadequate to satisfy management’s appetite for funding, the society was demutualized. Taking advantage of the freedom conferred by Margaret Thatcher’s big-bang financial reforms, Northern Rock followed the example of building societies like Abbey National and the Halifax, converting itself into a bank and thereby enabling management to float shares on the London Stock Exchange.

No longer having members looking over their shoulders, the management team, led by Adam Applegarth, sought to grow the bank at breakneck speed. Applegarth was a local, born in Sunderland, and a graduate of Durham University. He joined the bank straight out of university and rose quickly through the ranks, being appointed CEO in 2001 at the age of thirty-eight. Applegarth’s most prominent attributes, along with his ambition and love of sports, which made him a boon drinking companion and endeared him to his bank colleagues, were supreme confidence and a willingness to take risks. Northern Rock under Applegarth adopted all the trappings of a progressive twenty-first-century mortgage lender. The bank financed its operations not by attracting deposits but by borrowing from other financial institutions; it relied on wholesale funding more heavily than any other UK financial institution. It loosened down-payment requirements for mortgage borrowers to increase its market share. Its signature product, the “Together loan,” allowed homeowners to borrow as much as 125 percent of the value of their home.32 The bank opened branches in shopping centers, à la Countrywide. It offered high interest rates to attract Internet deposits. It outsourced mortgage origination to independent brokers. It securitized and sold off its loans, raising money for yet further operations, through a special purpose vehicle with the solid-sounding name of Granite on the tax-advantaged island of Jersey.

All this allowed Northern Rock to expand at a 20 percent annual rate for the better part of two decades. But, as should have been evident to anyone observing this rapid expansion, it also allowed vulnerabilities to build up. With the development of problems in the US market, Northern Rock found itself unable to securitize and sell off its loans.33 And in the wake of the August 9 BNP announcement, the wholesale money market collapsed. In effect, the two obvious avenues for raising cash, selling off mortgage-backed securities to investors and borrowing from other banks, dried up simultaneously.

On August 10 Applegarth huddled with his board chairman, Matthew Ridley. Ridley was a onetime journalist and libertarian philosopher turned mass-market author. The celebrity sire of an old Northumberland family, his most successful book, The Red Queen, used a character from Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking-Glass to illustrate a theory of sexual reproduction. Popular science has its place, but that place is not obviously the boardroom. This background, in other words, did not qualify Ridley to advise on how to cope with a liquidity crisis. Nor did Applegarth have other ready sources of advice. Aside from Ridley, Northern Rock’s board was dominated by local notables like Andrew Fenwick, a member of the department-store family of the same name. These individuals added luster to the masthead, but none was capable of restraining an ambitious CEO, much less managing a funding crisis. To raise liquidity Applegarth was reduced to selling off assets for whatever he could get. What he could get, unfortunately, was not enough, once-liquid securities now fetching only rock bottom prices. At this point, Applegarth had no choice but to appeal to the Bank of England, as he did starting in mid-August. Finally on Thursday, September 13, after a month of lobbying, he obtained his long-sought “liquidity support facility.” The plan was to announce it the following Monday, leaving the weekend for a calming publicity campaign. Unfortunately, the decision leaked on Thursday night, leaving no time for preparations. The timing was doubly unfortunate for the fact that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Alisdair Darling, and the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, were committed to traveling to Portugal on Friday for a regularly scheduled meeting of EU officials. Canceling the trip would have fed the sense of panic, but in the absence of King and Darling it was not clear who was minding the store.

Nor did it help that the UK possessed a limited deposit-insurance scheme that fully covered only the first £2,000 of deposits. Up to £35,000, there was then a partial guarantee, and above that there was none. Britain had not suffered a bank run in 150 years—not even in the Great Depression, when the decision to go off the gold standard had enabled the Bank of England to cut interest rates and provide liquidity support to financial institutions and markets. Given this history, a comprehensive guarantee designed to head off runs seemed superfluous.

But simply because something hadn’t happened in 150 years was no guarantee, as it were, that it couldn’t happen in the circumstances of 2007. Investors immediately realized that the country’s deposit-insurance scheme did not provide much in the way of assurance. On Friday morning panicked depositors swamped Northern Rock’s website with requests for withdrawals, causing its servers to crash. Fearing that it was deliberately failing to process their requests, customers lined up outside its branches, attracting camera crews. Overwhelmed tellers barricaded themselves in the bank’s offices. King and Darling, in Porto, were reduced to watching these events on TV.

In the course of the day, panicked clients withdrew more than £1 billion, the equivalent of 5 percent of the bank’s retail deposits. Queues again formed outside branches in Sheffield and North London the next morning, and the constabulary was called for crowd control. Sunday was an enforced holiday, but withdrawals resumed on Monday. That evening Darling, fearing contagion to other banks, was forced to issue a taxpayer-backed guarantee of Northern Rock’s deposits.

No one emerged from this episode with his reputation enhanced. The Financial Services Authority, the lead supervisor, had clearly done too little to discourage Northern Rock from adopting a risky business model. It focused mechanically on whether the bank met the Basel II requirements for capital adequacy while neglecting its breakneck expansion and risky funding. Its stress tests failed to anticipate, much less incorporate, the kind of liquidity problems Northern Rock would experience in 2007. When blame was parceled out, the FSA paid a high price. It was first stripped of all meaningful regulatory authority and then abolished in 2013.

The Bank of England under King similarly underestimated the gravity of the threat. Already in mid-August Northern Rock had approached the bank for assistance but was rebuffed. Bank of England officials made it clear that Northern Rock should find a market solution. On September 12, just days before central bank officials concluded they had no choice but to provide exceptional liquidity support, King wrote the House of Commons affirming his belief that the banking system, of which Northern Rock was part, was capable of handling its own problems. If Northern Rock found it impossible to raise the requisite capital and liquidity, then it should be acquired by a stronger rival.34

This was a misreading. It was never realistic to think that another bank might acquire Northern Rock, given the opacity of its balance sheet. This was a lesson that US policy makers would learn when Lehman Brothers faced its existential crisis in 2008. At a minimum, the acquiring institution would have demanded a backstop facility from the Bank of England, something Governor King was reluctant to provide.35 The idea that Northern Rock might regain access to the wholesale money market was equally fantastic. And management knew it. Receiving the cold shoulder from the Bank of England, they explored using the bank’s single branch in the Republic of Ireland to obtain liquidity from the more accommodating ECB, before concluding that this was problematic from a legal standpoint.

The attitude of Bank of England officials is not easy to understand. Part of the explanation may be that Britain had not experienced a bank run on Governor King’s watch. Indeed it had not experienced a full-fledged bank run since 1866, as noted above. The absence of a recent bank run to concentrate the mind was similarly part of why Montagu Norman did not feel the same urgency as his American counterpart, George Harrison, to provide emergency assistance to Germany when the 1931 banking crisis showed signs of leapfrogging to London. But if memories of the bank-run problem were remote in 1931, they were even more remote in 2008.

Another factor may be that King and others at the Bank of England were imperfectly informed of the situation facing Northern Rock. The central bank had been stripped of many regulatory duties in 1997 when it was granted independence from the Treasury. Central bank independence was a way of depoliticizing monetary policy, something that the newly formed government of Tony Blair sought to do in order to demonstrate its economic bona fides. But if the Bank of England was going to be independent, then it needed to be cut down to size. Responsibility for supervision and regulation was therefore shifted to the Financial Services Authority. Officially, the FSA cooperated with the Bank of England and the Treasury. But as in any bureaucracy where information is power, there was a gap between principle and practice.

As a result, Bank of England officials were uncertain about whether they possessed complete, up-to-date information on the condition of the banks. This reinforced their reluctance to become involved in the problems of individual financial institutions. In any case, preventing financial instability was now officially someone else’s problem. And bailing out distressed financial institutions too freely might only encourage neglect on the part of that someone else, the FSA.

This brings us to the most important factor, namely the preoccupation of King and his colleagues with moral hazard. The governor was critical of the ECB’s decision on August 8 following the suspension of the two BNP Paribas funds to provide the markets with unlimited amounts of liquidity. In his September 12 letter to the House of Commons, he warned that providing banks with liquidity against a wider range of collateral would encourage excessive risk taking.36 “The provision of large liquidity penalizes those financial institutions that sat out the dance,” King wrote, echoing Chuck Prince. It “encourages herd behavior and increases the intensity of future crises.” The implication was that liquidity would be provided only at a penalty rate after other options were exhausted.

This hard line against moral hazard was quite different from the lend-now-and-ask-questions-later approach of the Bernanke Fed. Again, it is worth recalling that the Bank of England, unlike the Fed, had not experienced a full-blown banking panic in 150 years. As a result, Friedman and Schwartz’s narrative leading to the conclusion that the central bank’s first responsibility is to head off a panic, after which there would be ample time to deal with moral hazard, was not assimilated to the same extent. The effort to teach a lesson to the Adam Applegarths of the world came at a high price. The Labour government, seemingly making things up as it went, was compelled to issue a blanket guarantee of Northern Rock’s deposits despite the fact that it lacked clear statutory authority to do so. After adopting a hard line on moral hazard, the Bank of England was forced to open the floodgates, providing emergency liquidity. Applegarth resigned in November. Ridley was removed as chairman, and other board members followed him out the door. Failing to find a buyer, the government nationalized the bank the following February. In the five months Northern Rock was left in limbo, losses continued to mount. Eventually, in 2012, the remnants of the Rock were sold to Virgin Money for £820 million, leaving British taxpayers with losses of more than £2 billion. This was a high price tag for the slow and inconsistent response of officials.

And the fact that Britain experienced its first bank run in 150 years did not reassure observers of the condition of its financial system or the competence of its authorities.
