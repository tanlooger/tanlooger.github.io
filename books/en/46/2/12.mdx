title: Chapter 12 Scant Evidence
---



At this point, the third week of September, conditions showed every sign of spiraling out of control. Fire sales by Northern Rock and other banks put downward pressure on asset prices, inflicting losses on investors. A problem that had once seemed confined to hedge funds invested in subprime-linked securities and building societies with extensive commitments to the mortgage market was now creating very serious problems for investors of all types.

Prominent among those other investors were money market mutual funds in the United States. Although money market funds had been around since the 1970s, as explained in Chapter 4, their devotion to commercial paper was new. With the growth of alternative investment vehicles, money funds had found it increasingly challenging to attract and retain investors. An obvious way of doing so, as we also saw in Chapter 4, was by offering higher returns. This they sought to do by replacing the treasury bills in their portfolios with higher-yielding commercial paper.

The most venerable money market fund, Reserve Primary Fund, was a case in point. For many years its managers had followed a conservative strategy, offering their liquidityand safety-minded investors a return slightly below that on high-quality short-term corporate debt. But as they saw their customers lured away by other investment vehicles offering higher returns, they responded by adding more asset-backed commercial paper, first slowly and then sharply in 2007.1

The Securities and Exchange Commission was not unaware of this tendency to stretch for yield. It therefore limited money funds to holding AAA or AA-rated commercial paper.2 This quaint regulation hailed from the bygone 分页。。。era when defaults on high-grade commercial paper were rare. This would not be the last time the SEC was shown as behind the curve.

Nor did the Fed’s injection of liquidity into the banking system afford money funds much relief. It did not relieve the stress on the commercial paper market, given that banks now refused to buy or lend against suddenly illiquid asset-backed paper. Failing to relieve the stress on the commercial paper market, it similarly failed to relieve the pressure on the money funds.

Investors had been told that a dollar in a money market account, like a dollar in a bank, would always be worth a dollar. News to the contrary—that a money market fund had suffered losses and was unable to return one hundred cents on the dollar—could therefore cause them to flee. Indeed this problem of investor panic was even greater for money market mutual funds than for banks. Unlike bank accounts, money market mutual fund accounts were not covered by federal deposit insurance. And unlike banks, money market mutual funds had no capital—no additional resources with which to absorb losses.

The only solution under the circumstances was for money market funds to be rescued by their parents, whether commercial banks or fund families. In the second half of 2007, forty-three money market mutual funds were quietly bailed out this way. These sponsor-based rescues replenished their balance sheets. They prevented investor runs for the time being. But they also created false confidence that runs were unlikely. They encouraged the false belief that there was little risk of even the highest-yielding funds “breaking the buck”— breaking the promise that a dollar in a money market account would always be worth a dollar.3 That false confidence would come back to haunt investors—and policy makers—a year later when even more severe turmoil put those parent banks and fund families at risk. The hedge-fund run, the collapse of the market in asset-backed commercial paper, and the bailout of money market mutual funds were enough to convince policy makers that they had a situation on their hands. The Fed cut the discount rate by half a percentage point on August 17, eight days after the BNP announcement. To reassure investors that adequate funding would be available, it offered to lend for thirty days rather than just overnight. It then cut rates a second time, by an additional fifty basis points (half a percent), in mid-September. To lubricate the interbank market, it purchased $47 billion of securities from “primary dealers,” the big banks with whom it regularly did business. On December 11 it cut policy rates (both the discount rate and the federal funds rate) by an additional twenty-five basis points. On December 12, sparking some controversy, it announced the creation of a Term Auction Facility through which it would lend to all depository institutions and not just primary dealers. On January 22, acting exceptionally between regularly scheduled FOMC meetings, it cut the federal funds rate by an additional seventy-five basis points. Eight days later, at the next regularly scheduled meeting, it reduced the funds rate by another fifty points.

This was an impressively rapid response, demonstrating that Fed officials understood full well how to respond to signs of financial distress. This was not new knowledge. As we saw in Chapter 7, George Harrison and his colleagues had understood equally how to respond to the financial distress caused by the 1929 crash. But now the lessons of that history were clearly drawn. The response of the Bernanke Fed was even more forceful.

In addition, Bernanke and Co. avoided the mistake of 1931, when Harrison hesitated to aid European banks in distress, allowing the crisis to infect still other countries.4 The destruction that could be wrought by inadequate international cooperation was another lesson widely drawn from the Great Depression.5 In response, central banks invested in arrangements for fostering such cooperation, for example repurposing the Bank for International Settlements from a reparations bank to a venue for regular exchange of views on the part of monetary officials. The result was more scope for international cooperation.

One example of this was how, starting on December 12, the Fed made credit available to a Europe desperate for dollar funding by negotiating currency swaps with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. Trading dollars for euros and francs enabled the ECB and SNB to make dollars available to their banks.6 In time, these swap agreements would be criticized by, among others, libertarian congressman and perennial presidential candidate Ron Paul for putting the Fed’s balance sheet at risk. In fact it was the ECB and SNB, not the Fed, that bore the risk of European banks not being able to repay what they borrowed.

In addition, the Fed lent dollars directly to European commercial banks via the discount window—that is, by taking their paper directly. On August 20 the US subsidiary of Commerzbank borrowed $350 million from the Fed. Deutsche Bank borrowed $2.4 billion on November 8. Calyon, the corporate banking arm of the French bank Crédit Agricole, borrowed $2 billion.

As subsidiaries of foreign banks, these entities were not required to hold capital to back their US operations, the belief being that their European parents stood behind them. Lacking reserves of their own, Calyon and the American subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank relied on their ability to sell asset-backed commercial paper when the need for dollar liquidity arose. But markets in asset-backed commercial paper were now frozen, and the foreign parents in question had only limited dollars of their own. They were thus forced to turn to the Fed. Although the three foreign bank subsidiaries posted collateral for their loans, this would not have calmed Congressman Paul, who—had he known—would have screamed bloody murder about the Fed bailing out foreign-owned financial institutions.7 Together with borrowing at the discount window being seen as a sign of weakness, this explains why the transactions in question were kept quiet.

The fiscal policy response was similarly rapid by Washington standards. Negotiations between Congress and the White House began in earnest in January 2008. Although the Democrat-controlled Congress and Republican executive did not agree on the composition of a fiscal stimulus, with the Republicans favoring tax cuts and the Democrats preferring increases in food stamps and unemployment benefits, they agreed to split the difference. A $150 billion stimulus, the equivalent of 1 percent of GDP, comprising $100 billion of tax cuts and $50 billion of spending, was passed after less than a month. The administration agreed not to push for a Bush-style tax policy—it agreed that the tax cuts could be temporary rather than permanent—while the Democrats agreed to additional investment deductions for business. The first rebate checks went out in April. This was an impressive display of bipartisanship to which policy makers found it difficult to rise subsequently. Leading to the question: Why did it fail to avert the worst?

A first answer is that, fast as it was, the policy response was inadequate given the powerful negative impulse in the pipeline. By the end of 2007 the economy was already in recession. Yet there was still little awareness of how rapidly the outlook was shifting. As a result, following the policy measures of late 2007 and early 2008 there were no comparably significant policy initiatives to support a weakening economy by the Fed or the Congress in the late spring and summer of 2008.

Consider the Fed. At its October 2007 meeting the Federal Open Market Committee acknowledged only a modest slowing of growth and noted “scant evidence” that the correction in the housing market was spilling over to the rest of the economy. As late as the summer of 2008, real-time data suggested that the economy was continuing to expand. At midyear, forecasts for the second half of 2008 were still for continued growth.8 As late as the August 2008 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Richmond Reserve Bank president Jeffrey Lacker expressed skepticism “about the magnitude of the drag on consumption and investment spending that credit market conditions are likely to create.”9 At the mid-September 2008 meeting of the committee, members were still anticipating “sluggish growth” in the second half of the year.10

Even at this late date, in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers, there was still limited appreciation, then, of how the financial system was amplifying the shock to the housing market. There was still little understanding of the broader implications. The Fed had reduced policy rates sharply between August 2007 and January 2008 in response to signs of slower economic growth. There were a couple of more reductions in rates at the time of the Bear Stearns crisis in March and April 2008, but these were small by comparison. Much like its predecessor in late 1929, at this point the Fed concluded that its work was done.

Later—too much later—the Fed would cut policy rates further, all the way to zero. It would adopt unconventional policies of quantitative easing (large-scale purchases of treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities) to provide more support for the economy. It would take radical steps to unfreeze financial markets. Hindsight suggests that it should have moved more quickly and aggressively, taking these kinds of steps already in early 2008. But exceptional action could be justified only by the threat of an exceptional slowdown. And, as yet, awareness of this threat was not there.

As a student of the Great Depression, Bernanke was more concerned than many of his colleagues, and many of the regional Reserve bank presidents serving on the Federal Open Market Committee in particular, that mounting financial problems might now lead to a serious recession.11 Those other members of the Fed’s policy-making committee viewed developments not through the lens of the 1920s and 1930s but through that of the post-1970 experience on which they were weaned. The decade of the 1970s had been one of inflation, when the Fed veered seriously off track, and the preoccupation of subsequent monetary policy makers was inflation, not crisis. Even now, with the economy on the brink of the most serious crisis in eighty years, it was those fears of inflation that continued to shape their outlook and guide their thinking.

Their specific worry in the wake of the sharp interest rate cuts taken between August 2007 and January 2008 was that the Fed would be too slow to “take back” the liquidity it had given the markets, leading to a surge of inflation. The fact that food and fuel prices were rising, owing as it happened to strong demands from China, seemed to some to validate those fears. At the FOMC’s April 2008 meeting, Philadelphia Fed president Charles Plosser warned of the danger that higher energy and commodity prices would cause producers, facing higher costs, to mark up the prices of other goods (that so-called headline inflation would be passed through into core inflation cleansed of volatile foodand fuel-related components). Richmond’s Lacker warned that “persistently high headline numbers could become ingrained in household and business decisionmaking.” Kansas City’s Thomas Hoenig warned of “significant inflation pressure from goods prices, especially imported goods prices.”12 Bernanke pushed back, suggesting that what these gentlemen were observing was a change in relative prices—higher food and fuel prices accompanied by more slowly rising prices of other goods and services. But policy was made by consensus, and the consensus view was shaped by memories of the inflationary 1970s, not the crisis-ridden 1930s.

Those fears of inflation largely immobilized the Fed’s policy-making committee until after the failure of Lehman Brothers in September, and even then some members were strikingly slow to revise their outlook. Chairman Bernanke may have known better, but again policy was made not according to the chair’s dictates but by committee. And Bernanke’s committee was more consensus-oriented than most. Some previous Fed chairs might have imperiously overridden colleagues’ objections, but this was not Bernanke’s way. The result was that the Fed failed to do more. With private lending contracting, the result was a de facto contractionary policy and inadequate monetary support for the economy.

Similarly, a fiscal stimulus of 1 percent of GDP was too little to make a difference given the negative impulse in the pipeline. Banks, firms, and households were all deleveraging furiously. The majority of the stimulus, recall, took the form of rebate checks, perhaps only half of which the recipients went out and spent.13 A stimulus five times as large would be adopted a year later, and some would argue that even this was too small. With hindsight, we can say that a bit of additional stimulus at the beginning of 2008 might have averted the need for very much larger stimulus in 2009. More public spending in 2008 to offset retrenchment by households and firms would have meant a more slowly decelerating economy, fewer bad loans, and stronger financial institutions. Whether it would have significantly altered the course of events, given the already tenuous state of affairs, we will never know.

Whatever the answer, doing more at the beginning of 2008 could be justified only if there was awareness that conditions were deteriorating rapidly. And, again, such awareness was not there. Congress would have to see a much more serious crisis before it was prepared to pass the $800 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program in October 2008 or the $787 billion Obama stimulus in 2009.

What this episode reveals is that better understanding of how policy should respond to changes in economic and financial conditions is not enough when evidence of those changes is incomplete. The evidence at the time did not convince officials that economic conditions were deteriorating rapidly. Though they may have understood better than their predecessors in 1929 how to react to such a deterioration, this alone did not guarantee an adequate response. One reason the Fed did not do more in 1929 was that, in the wake of the Crash, observers believed the economy was continuing to expand.14 One reason the Fed did not do more in the last months of 2007 was again that observers, even though aware that growth was slowing, believed the economy was continuing to expand. Having themselves now lived through such an episode, modern critics are likely to show more sympathy for 1920s policy makers, who, in the early stages of their crisis, faced significant uncertainty about the state of the economy.

In addition, just as every generation writes its own history, to paraphrase the 1916 comment by the president of the American Historical Association, H. Morse Stephens, every generation remembers its own history.15 For many members of the FOMC in 2008, the influential history was that of high inflation some thirty years earlier—that is, in their own lifetimes—rather than the more distant echoes of a Depression-era past. For members of Congress, the relevant history was of recent decades characterized by chronic budget deficits, not of a Depression-era crisis when additional government spending could have been part of the solution and not the problem.

The parallel with the 1930s, then, is direct. In the 1930s Federal Reserve officials, looking to the preceding period when sharp increases in interest rates signaled financial distress, took the decline in interest rates following the Great Crash as a sign that there was no need for policy makers to do more. This historically rooted preoccupation caused officials to misinterpret the decline in interest rates—to see it as evidence that policy was accommodating rather than that all demand for credit had evaporated. Policy, as a result, was inadequately supportive of the economy, and the consequences were disastrous.

Now, in 2008, Federal Reserve officials looking back on the 1970s took the rise in headline inflation as evidence that monetary stimulus was excessive and that more would be counterproductive. This historically rooted preoccupation with inflation caused them to misinterpret the rise in food and fuel prices, which was being driven by China and not by their own policies. As a result, policy was again inadequately supportive of the economy. And, again, the consequences were disastrous.

A final reason policy failed to avert the worst was that policy was still targeted at the banks, while many of the most treacherous problems were, in fact, in the shadow banking system. Providing the banks with liquidity, whether through the discount window or the Term Auction Facility, did nothing to relieve the stress on mortgage securitizers, commercial paper issuers, and money market mutual funds, given the banks’ reluctance to lend to their shadowy counterparts. Eventually the Fed would attack this problem by purchasing securitized mortgages, asset-backed commercial paper, and related assets directly. But not in 2007, and not until conditions had deteriorated further. The 1930s crisis centered on the banking system. Influenced by that history, it was to the banking system that the Fed now looked. Lending to banks was the Fed’s bread and butter. Extraordinary circumstances would be required before established practice could be discarded. And in the second half of 2007, policy makers were not yet there. There had been resistance within the Fed, on moral hazard grounds, to creating the Term Auction Facility through which the central bank lent to counterparties other than the primary dealers. In addition there would have been external resistance, from Representative Paul and others, had the Fed adopted even more unconventional policies, buying mortgage-related securities for example, while there was still “scant evidence” of a slowdown. In the absence of a more forceful response, industrial production declined in January 2008, again in February, and again in March.16 The Dow Jones average continued to slide, its cumulative fall reaching 20 percent.17 Still, the markets were unprepared for what came next, next being Bear Stearns. The run on Bear marked a new stage in the crisis. It was a run not on a hedge fund, a money fund, or an issuer of asset-backed commercial paper but on a bank with open trades with five thousand other financial and nonfinancial firms.18 The run on Bear demonstrated that the banks at the center of the financial system, and not just their shadowy counterparts, were now fundamentally at risk.

That Bear Stearns became a target was no coincidence. It was the smallest of the Big Five investment banks. It had been singled out of the herd by the failure of its two hedge funds the previous summer. Its former CEO and still board chairman Jimmy Cayne had been publicly portrayed as more interested in golf, bridge, and marijuana than the fate of his company.

Bear was also highly leveraged. With little capital of its own, in order to meet obligations it depended entirely on the goodwill and forbearance of its lenders. It had been attempting to raise additional capital, but without success. It was heavily invested in Alt-A mortgages, which were just one step up from subprime. Cayne’s successor as CEO, Alan Schwartz, was a onetime professional baseball pitcher turned investment banker who had worked his way up through the ranks. Schwartz was known for being easygoing and even-tempered, in contrast to Cayne, but complex derivative securities were not part of his repertoire.

On learning about the firm’s derivatives positions on the fly, Schwartz recognized that Bear Stearns couldn’t stay afloat without a cash infusion. The firm had been attempting to obtain it by selling its derivatives holdings to Blackrock, PIMCO, or another stronger financial player. But against the backdrop of the unfolding crisis, those positions were now impossible to dispose of even at a loss. The effort to do so would inevitably become public knowledge, causing investors to conclude that the seller was mortally wounded.

On Monday, March 10, Moody’s downgraded the mortgage-backed debt of yet another Bear Stearns fund, fueling rumors about the condition of its parent. Whether the value of Bear’s portfolio of securities was in fact sufficient to meet its obligations was unclear, now that markets had seized up, and it was impossible to obtain price quotations from buyers. It could be that Bear was solvent and the situation could be stabilized by an infusion of cash or a takeover by a stronger, deep-pocketed competitor. But there was also the possibility that the fundamental value of its mortgage securities had fallen so far that the bank was broke, in which case its lenders would be wise to get out before it was too late. No one knew for sure.

What followed was essentially a run by the other large financial institutions that had provided Bear Stearns with liquid funds. One after another, lenders refused the firm’s collateral, forcing it to meet commitments with cash. Where Bear had started the week with $18 billion of cash and liquid securities, by Thursday night its cash balances had fallen to less than $2 billion.

At this point there was no question that when the firm opened on Friday morning it would be out of cash and out of business. On Thursday night Schwartz communicated the bad news to Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Timothy Geithner. This gave the Fed just hours to put in place emergency assistance sufficient to get Bear to the weekend, over which a more durable solution might be reached.

Schwartz’s decision to call Geithner was revealing. The Fed was not Bear Stearns’ regulator, that dubious distinction belonging to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Bear formally being a dealer in securities. But the SEC, having been set up to oversee securities brokers, was over its head in seeking to regulate, much less resolve, what was in reality a bank with an exceedingly complex balance sheet. In 2007 its inspectors had meekly signed off on Bear’s accounts. When SEC chairman Christopher Cox learned that Schwartz was reaching out to the government, he confidently assured Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson that the firm was sound and would find a buyer in a matter of weeks.19

Though the Fed was not in the business of regulating, much less lending to, investment banks, it had something more important, namely the power of the printing press. It was the only government agency able to come up with large amounts of money overnight. The solution agreed to at 8:00 a.m. on the morning of Friday, March 14, an hour before the markets opened, was for the Fed to lend $12.9 billion to JPMorgan Chase, a bank that the Fed did regulate and that not incidentally was the dominant player in the market in which Bear Stearns obtained its short-term funds.20 JPMorgan would then pass the money on to Bear in a so-called back-toback transaction.

Significantly, the loan to JPMorgan was nonrecourse. In other words, although Bear Stearns put up collateral in the form of securities notionally valued at some $14 billion, the central bank and not JPMorgan was on the hook if those assets turned out to be worth less than the paper they were written on. This transaction thus exposed the Fed, and indirectly the taxpayer, to the risk of losses, since the Fed regularly turned its profits over to the Treasury. This realization was not received happily on Capitol Hill. It weakened public support for further interventions, the fear being that more liabilities for the taxpayer might be hiding behind the curtain. The financial system survived the Bear Stearns crisis. Faith in the central bank did not.

To justify its exposure to a non-commercial-banking firm, the board of governors invoked a heretofore obscure provision of the Federal Reserve Act permitting the central bank to lend not just to member banks but also to individuals and corporations under “unusual and exigent circumstances.”21 This provision was in fact yet another legacy of the Great Depression. In 1932 Congress had added a Section 13(b) to the Federal Reserve Act in response to business complaints that the banking crisis had interrupted the provision of private bank credit, and to populist concerns that the Federal Reserve was favoring finance over business (sound familiar?). Section 13(b) allowed the Fed to make loans to private business so long as circumstances were “unusual and exigent” and the borrowers were engaged in agricultural, industrial, and commercial transactions.

The provision was rarely used, but it remained on the books. It was broadened in 1991, in response to lobbying by Goldman Sachs, to permit the Fed, under what was now known as Section 13(3), to lend directly to securities firms in emergencies. Current circumstances clearly qualified. That JPMorgan Chase was the middleman in this transaction was a fact freighted with irony. Pierpont Morgan’s role in helping to contain the 1907 financial crisis was in a sense the event that had led to the founding of the Federal Reserve, given fears that a private crisis manager could turn rescue operations to his advantage. Morgan partner Thomas Lamont had played a prominent role in 1930, working with the New York Fed and New York State Banking Commission, in seeking to resolve the Bank of United States. JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was Sandy Weill’s right-hand man when Weill engineered the Citicorp-Travelers merger that drove the final nail into the coffin of Glass-Steagall. Having moved on to head the Chicago-based Bank One, Dimon had then unsuccessfully attempted to purchase Bear Stearns, the very bank he was now being asked to rescue.

Dimon, like Owen Young before him, served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. He was a graduate of Harvard College and a third-generation financier. The Bear Stearns crisis was an opportunity to step into the shoes Pierpont Morgan had worn in 1907. On the morning of Friday, March 14, when Geithner, Bernanke, Paulson, and other government officials considered whether to provide the $12.9 billion loan, Dimon was plugged into the phone call and spoke for the financial community, warning that the consequences of a Bear Stearns failure would be catastrophic. When the policy team convened a conference call with other bank CEOs later that morning, it was Dimon, not Geithner, Paulson, or Bernanke, who took the lead in fielding questions.22

The challenge was to find another bank capable of absorbing Bear Stearns. The task was not unlike the attempt to find a marriage partner for the Bank of United States in 1930. It now became apparent, not entirely to the surprise of certain of the principals, that JPMorgan Chase was the only plausible suitor. It had the size and, as clearing bank for Bear’s transactions, some knowledge of its positions.

But the more closely Dimon’s people scoured Bear Stearns’ books, the more illiquid securities they unearthed. Bear had sold off the liquid ones in the struggle to stay alive. Dimon’s solution lay in the fact that the government was desperate to find a buyer. He had the authorities over a barrel, and he knew it. On Sunday morning he announced that he was prepared to pursue the purchase only if the authorities took $30 billion of illiquid mortgage-linked securities off his hands.

There being no time for the Congress to approve, once more the Federal Reserve stepped into the breach. But the Fed couldn’t purchase the securities of institutions like Bear Stearns, even under unusual and exigent circumstances; it could only lend to such entities. The central bank circumvented this restriction by drawing on one of the same financial-engineering devices that had contributed to the crisis. Instead of purchasing the assets of Bear Stearns, it created a special purpose vehicle, named Maiden Lane LLC after the street running alongside its New York branch, to do so for it. The Fed then “lent” to the SPV, which then turned around and purchased securities from Bear. This now was a much larger and longer-term commitment than the central bank had taken previously, when lending Bear Stearns, via JPMorgan, $12.9 billion for a couple of days. Geithner and Bernanke therefore obtained a promise from Secretary Paulson that if Maiden Lane took losses on the transaction, Treasury would do its best to compensate the Fed.23

JPMorgan’s management, from Dimon on down, was pleased by the deal. It allowed Dimon to position himself as savior of the financial system in the manner of Pierpont Morgan before him. It gave JPMorgan Chase a presence in prime brokerage, the business of providing financing to hedge funds, something it had lacked previously. Having initially offered $4 a share, Dimon had lowered the offer price to $2 on the advice of Paulson, who insisted on demonstrating that government assistance came at a heavy price. Ultimately, JPMorgan Chase upped its offer to $10 a share to prevent some of Bear’s top talent, themselves investors in the company, from walking away.24

JPMorgan Chase ended up paying $1.5 billion for a bank that as recently as January 2007 had been valued at $20 billion and whose headquarters building at 383 Madison Avenue alone was worth close to $1.4 billion.25 In his March 2009 letter to shareholders, Dimon asserted that he expected the Bear Stearns acquisition to contribute $1 billion of annual earnings to the company.26 This was nothing if not a healthy annual return on a $1.5 billion investment.

Much later, in 2012, Dimon claimed that JPMorgan Chase made the purchase as a public service. “We did them [the government] a favor,” he explained at the Council on Foreign Relations. “We were asked to do it, and we did it at great risk to ourselves.”27 Risk, of course, is not something with which bankers are unfamiliar. One senses an ex post rationalization of the fact that, rather than earning $1 billion a year, as expected, JPMorgan ended up taking losses on the assets it inherited and the lawsuits it incurred as a result of the Bear Stearns acquisition. There was also an undercurrent of resentment in Dimon’s remarks, reflecting the fact that Treasury and the Fed did not come to his defense when the New York State attorney general filed a civil suit against JPMorgan Chase, alleging that Bear Stearns had deceived investors in mortgage-linked securities in 2006. To the contrary, the US Justice Department pursued JPMorgan for misrepresentation of the quality of securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both by its own units and by the Bear Stearns units it now acquired, eventually reaching a settlement in which the bank agreed to pay $13 billion. As Dimon put it, when first acknowledging losses related to Bear Stearns, “And yes, I put it in the unfair category.”

Dimon was not the only one with second thoughts. The Fed was criticized for exceeding its mandate. It was accused of encouraging risk taking by other firms that would now similarly expect official help if things went wrong. In fact, the Fed was ultimately (meaning, in 2012) repaid the entirety of its loan, with interest, once the mortgage-related securities acquired by Maiden Lane matured or were successfully sold off. In hindsight, this suggests that Geithner, Paulson, and Co. were right to diagnose Bear’s problem as essentially a liquidity crisis and proceed with an emergency loan. Still, the criticism to which the central bank was subjected, and its own discomfort with these unprecedented interventions, would cause it to hesitate when it next faced an analogous problem.

The situation was not unlike 1933, when similar instincts were allowed to prevail. A Reconstruction Finance Corporation stung by criticism of its decision to rescue Charles Dawes’ Central Republic chose to make a statement by allowing Henry Ford’s Union Guardian to go under.28 The result was the mother of all banking crises. One might think that this history would have informed decision making now. In the heat of the moment, it did not. On Friday, July 11, the FDIC seized Indymac Bank, the S&L arm of the ­seventh-largest mortgage originator. An analyst from none other than Lehman Brothers warned that the government-sponsored housing companies Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be next.

Though it was hardly news that Freddie and Fannie had incurred losses, the Lehman report catalyzed the market’s fears. Specifically, it excited the single largest purchaser of Freddie and Fannie’s bonds, the Chinese government. To a greater extent than investors closer at hand, the Chinese continued to pay attention to the reports and analyses of the investment banks and rating agencies. As they now curtailed their purchases, shares in Freddie and Fannie cratered. Doubts grew about whether the government-sponsored entities would be able to fund themselves in future debt auctions.

Over the July 12–13 weekend, the Fed stepped once more into the breach, invoking unusual and exigent circumstances in order to add Freddie and Fannie to the list of mendicants with access to the discount window. Secretary Paulson asked the House and Senate for authority to inject capital into the two institutions. After two weeks of politicking, Congress agreed. The administration invoked that authority in September, placing Freddie and Fannie into conservatorship and guaranteeing their obligations. The mortgage giants were effectively nationalized.

Allowing Freddie and Fannie to fail was not an option, however much free-market purists might have wished otherwise. Fannie and Freddie, as holders of some $5 trillion of outstanding mortgage-backed securities, were an order of magnitude larger than Bear Stearns. With the collapse of the subprime market, they were purchasing or guaranteeing fully two-thirds of all new mortgages. The housing market, already reeling, could hardly be expected to absorb the consequences of closing them down.

This didn’t mean, however, that Congress and the commentariat were happy about the fact. Paulson pushed hard for the enabling legislation, but his party pushed back. Congressional Republicans were irate about being asked to bail out a pair of GSEs they saw as subverting the free operation of the market. The Fed was dressed down for helping JPMorgan help Bear Stearns. This was nothing, however, compared to the criticism now heaped on Treasury for bailing out Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. This criticism surely colored views of how to respond to the next crisis.

All this suggests that when the Lehman Brothers crisis erupted eight weeks later, Treasury and the Fed were looking to make a statement. With an election just two months off (notice again the proximity of crises to elections), they wanted to reassure the politicians that they too were weary of bailouts.

As a result, little was done to prepare for what, after the fact, was seen as the inevitable. It was not as if officials were unaware of Lehman’s plight. The collapse of Bear Stearns had raised questions about the viability of the investment banking model of which Lehman was a prime exponent. The cost of buying insurance against Lehman’s failure shot up once Bear’s difficulties became known. The cost of buying protection against the failure of Morgan Stanley also rose, albeit less dramatically, indicating a clear hierarchy of concern. Paulson’s telephone log recorded ten calls a month to Lehman CEO Dick Fuld between Bear Stearns’ rescue in March and Lehman’s failure in September. Paulson emphasized the need for Lehman to raise capital. Fuld emphasized the difficulty of doing so. He indicated in no uncertain terms that a strategic investor like JPMorgan Chase would be needed if his firm were to survive the release of its quarterly financial statement in September.

At the same time, the very fact that Lehman’s problems were well known was reason for thinking it could go down without taking the financial system along with it. Investors had time to hedge their exposures and otherwise prepare. Or so it was believed, in particular by Chairman Bernanke, according to his subsequent testimony to the House Financial Services Committee. “The failure of Lehman posed risks,” Bernanke acknowledged. “But the troubles at Lehman had been well known for some time, and investors clearly recognized—as evidenced, for example, by the high cost of insuring Lehman’s debt in the market for credit default swaps—that the failure of the firm was a significant possibility. Thus, we judged that investors and counterparties had had time to take precautionary measures.”29 The problem was that some risks are too big to hedge. This was the case of those of American International Group (AIG), which sold copious amounts of insurance against Lehman’s failure. And some investors, in their wisdom, thought that the smart thing to do in the circumstances was to avoid incurring the cost of insurance. There may have been a tendency, in other words, to assume that because Bear Stearns was rescued the same treatment would be extended to Lehman Brothers. But Lehman’s problems ran deeper. It owned more toxic mortgages. It had more debt than Bear Stearns, in excess of $660 billion.

And Lehman had, if anything, even more dysfunctional management. If Jimmy Cayne’s weakness was poker, Dick Fuld’s was building his bank, whatever the cost. The grandson of one of Lehman’s major clients, Fuld had joined the firm as an intern in 1969. He quickly became a successful bond trader, being endowed with the athleticism, combativeness, and profane mouth of the ilk. Fuld was promoted to head of the fixed income division and became CEO in 1994 when American Express divested itself of the bank. Fuld was conscious that his company lacked the size of JPMorgan Chase and the cachet of Goldman Sachs. For a hypercompetitive CEO, no strategy for correcting this unacceptable situation was too ambitious. And when those strategies went awry, Fuld, unlike Cayne, was not inclined to step aside.

Historians hesitate to hang world-changing events on personalities, exceptions like Friedman and Schwartz’s attribution of the Great Depression to Benjamin Strong’s untimely death notwithstanding. But Fuld’s personality is unquestionably part of the explanation for why Lehman continued to move aggressively into real estate when other investment banks had already concluded that the jig was up. It explains why he refused to entertain an acquisition offer from the Korea Development Bank in the summer of 2008.30

And personality explains, if anything can, how Fuld could believe, when he preannounced Lehman’s whopping $3.9 billion third-quarter loss in a conference call on September 10, that the markets would be reassured by his having a plan for winding down the bank’s exposure to commercial and residential real estate. Fuld’s plan, it turned out, was nothing more than placing the firm’s real estate assets into an off-balance-sheet vehicle—unfortunately named “SpinCo.” Just who would finance SpinCo was unclear, given that Lehman couldn’t. Investors were quick to conclude that SpinCo was spin.

It was bad luck, or bad planning, that Fuld’s conference call was announced on a Tuesday and not at the end of the week. News of the call was enough to send the company’s stock into a tailspin. JPMorgan Chase, always the markets’ friend, then demanded that Lehman put up an additional $5 billion in cash in order to maintain its credit line. That was all the cash Fuld had on hand, although he was able to temporarily replenish the piggy bank by borrowing on the repo market. The fact of someone still being confident that Lehman’s collateral was good was notable in itself. It is powerful testimony to the enduring belief that the Treasury and Fed would find a way out.

What followed was a reprise of Bear Stearns weekend, with Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis playing the Jamie Dimon role. But Bank of America was already having trouble digesting the troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial, whose acquisition in January 2008 was Lewis’s signal achievement. (After four years, Bank of America’s acquisition of Countrywide came to be seen as “the worst deal in the history of American finance,” in the words of Tony Plath, a University of North Carolina professor, a sentiment that was widely shared.31) If he was now going to do more, Lewis preferred to acquire Merrill Lynch with its Thundering Herd of sixteen thousand brokers (or “trusted financial advisors,” as Merrill preferred to put it) and their three million brokerage accounts, as he did on Sunday, September 14.32 Lehman’s bad real estate investments were larger than Bear’s, what with housing and mortgage-market conditions having continued to worsen. Where JPMorgan had succeeded in getting the authorities to take $30 billion of Bear Stearns assets, Lewis indicated on Friday that the comparable number for Lehman would be $40 billion. The following day he upped his estimate to $70 billion.

Treasury indemnification would again be needed for the New York Fed to contemplate buying, indirectly of course, $70 billion of Lehman Brothers’ assets. But this is what Paulson now refused to provide. The treasury secretary had felt stinging criticism over earlier bailouts. He was on record as having dismissed Bear Stearns as a special case and insisting that it “was not something that we ever intend to repeat.”33 This was not a commitment on which he could easily go back.34

Paulson was further hamstrung by the fact that Treasury lacked open-ended authority to purchase mortgage-related assets, something it would acquire only with congressional passage of the Troubled Asset Relief Program in October. Although it was impractical now to sell off the $30 billion of Bear Stearns assets acquired in the spring, given the illiquidity of the markets, there was reason to think they would be worth something eventually (and, as noted above, the government ended up making money once they were sold). Lehman Brothers’ assets, in contrast, were a write-off waiting to happen. As treasury secretary, Paulson later argued, he lacked the authority to subject taxpayer funds to this risk.

This may have been the factor that drove the decision to let Lehman go under. If so, it reflected the single most important policy failure of 2008. Regulators had been watching Lehman at least since the Bear Stearns rescue in March.35 They knew the firm’s mortgage-related losses were mounting and that it was at risk of losing access to market funding.36 They knew that they lacked the authority to lend to an insolvent institution, but equally that putting it through bankruptcy would be disastrous, since its obligations would be frozen for the duration. Yet nothing was done to endow Treasury with the authority to wind up Lehman in an orderly way in the six months between Bear and Lehman.

In part this was a failure of imagination—an unwillingness to believe that an institution several times the size of Bear could actually run into the wall. In part it was a political problem: given populist opposition to bailouts for big financial firms, Congress was reluctant to give Treasury additional powers until the alternative was for the economy to go off a cliff, as finally happened in October. In 1932 the Reconstruction Finance Corporation similarly lacked the authority to inject capital into insolvent financial institutions, limiting its efforts to contain the spreading crisis. Only when the worst financial crisis in U.S. history struck in 1933 did Congress finally pass the Emergency Banking Act, relaxing this constraint. If Great Depression scholars like Bernanke were aware of the precedent, their awareness did not now alter the course of events.

The decision—or nondecision—to give Treasury and the Fed the powers needed to seize and forcibly recapitalize an insolvent investment bank could be made only by Congress. Not for the first time, political passions rather than cool economic and historical logic shaped the response. Treasury had already gone once to the well, asking Congress for authority to bail out Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and Congress was decidedly reluctant to consider another such request. To further complicate matters, the decisions in question were being made in an election year. Against this backdrop, there was no willingness on the part of the administration to go to Congress in the summer of 2008 to request additional powers.37

This left only the option of assembling a consortium of banks to take the bad Lehman assets off Bank of America’s hands. Staff and officials at the New York Fed scrambled to develop the requisite plan in the days prior to Lehman weekend. But it was never clear why other banks would be willing to play their part, given the toxic nature of Lehman’s assets. In 1998 the New York Fed had successfully assembled a consortium of financial institutions to provide emergency liquidity support to the troubled hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. This was the consortium in which Bear Stearns famously refused to participate. Still, that experience offered a model.

But LTCM, like Bear, had good if illiquid collateral. Lehman was a different story. One interpretation is that by opting for the private-sector solution, Paulson and his colleagues were implicitly agreeing to let Lehman Brothers go bust, appropriately it can be argued insofar as it is not the role of the government to keep an insolvent institution afloat. A more plausible conclusion is that no one—not Lewis, not Paulson, and certainly not the SEC—knew how bad Lehman’s balance sheet was until the weekend. They believed in the viability of the private-sector solution until it was too late. It was like Hoover’s attempt to engineer a private-sector solution to the crisis in 1931, not realizing that for many banks the problem was one of solvency, not simply liquidity.

But if this is the explanation for the failure, it was a failure now of due diligence by the bank, its regulators, and its counterparties. It was a failure of the Treasury, Fed, and Congress to prepare for the worst. It was a failure of the system.

In a last-ditch effort, Paulson and his colleagues attempted to broker the sale of Lehman to Barclays, the big British bank having expressed an interest in a deal. But the possibility of consummating it over a weekend was always remote. If Lehman was big by US standards, it was even bigger by the standards of the British financial system. This was sure to give pause to the prospective buyer. Barclays could trace its origins back to goldsmith banking in the seventeenth century. It had not survived for more than three hundred years by taking leaps in the dark. The bank and its regulator, the Financial Services Authority, would need time to parse the books. Uncomfortably, Barclays, like JPMorgan in the case of Bear Stearns, would have to guarantee Lehman’s trades even before the sale was consummated by a shareholder vote simply in order to keep the troubled bank afloat. Barclays was aware, in addition, that Bank of America, another potential suitor, had chosen to walk away.

On Sunday the FSA made clear that it had no intention of blessing the union. Lehman’s fate was sealed. That the Barclays deal was even pursued testifies to the desperation to which US policy makers were driven.38 It was no secret that Treasury and the Fed had been working to find a buyer for Lehman Brothers, and the example of Bear Stearns created at least some confidence that they would succeed. Hence Lehman’s failure was unexpected. The results were chaotic. With the authorities in denial, Lehman’s bankruptcy filing was delayed until 1:45 a.m. on Monday morning. With Asian markets already open, judgment was swift. The market in Singapore slumped by 2.9 percent, Taiwan by 4.1 percent, India by 5.4 percent.39

Twelve hours passed before Paulson finally entered the White House press room to reassure the assembled that it was not the end of the world. His audience was not convinced. With $613 billion of debts, Lehman’s was the largest bankruptcy in US history. The Dow fell by 504 points, or nearly 5 percent (its largest drop since the first trading day after September 11, 2001). Monday, September 15, 2008, was the worst day ever for the S&P financials, which closed down more than 10 percent.40

And if customer accounts at Lehman were not safe, who was to say the same might not be true of Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley? Hedge funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and college endowments all rushed to withdraw their funds from these once-impregnable firms. Not knowing who might be next, all willingness to lend evaporated. The commercial paper market and the interbank overnight market shut down tight.

This was nothing less than a full-fledged run on the shadow banking system. Deposit insurance of $100,000 was irrelevant when the institutions in question were prime brokers rather than commercial banks. Confidence was all there was. It did not survive the mixed signals of US officials and their foreign counterparts.
