For the moment, there was an eerie absence of financial accidents elsewhere. This allowed European leaders to insist that the post-Lehman crisis, like the subprime crisis of 2007, was an American problem demanding an American solution. But there were reasons for questioning whether the calm would last. At the top of the list was the perilous state of Europe’s banks. They were even more highly leveraged than their US counterparts.1 They relied on dollar funding, which the ECB and Bank of England could not provide.2 Some, like IKB, were heavily invested in subprime-linked securities, while others were heavily exposed to local housing markets and had loaded up on the high-yielding debts of Southern European governments.

Fortis, a Belgium-based financial conglomerate with operations in Luxembourg and the Netherlands, was the poster child for these excesses. It was not just Belgium’s biggest bank but also its single largest employer. Half of all Belgian households held accounts there. It had 85,000 employees worldwide and was the twentieth-largest business in the world by revenue. In other words, it was a clear case of too big to fail.

Fortis’ chairman since 1990 was Maurice Lippens, whose namesake grandfather had been president of the Belgian Senate and then governor general of the Congo. The grandson, like King Leopold II before him, sought to make his mark with an ambitious program of acquisitions. Fortis first purchased MeesPierson N. V., a three-hundred-year-old Dutch private bank, obtaining a presence in investment banking. Next it acquired American Bankers Insurance Group, expanding its presence in the US market. Seeking to branch into emerging markets, it purchased banks in Poland and Turkey. In 2007, at the worst possible time, it paid handsomely to acquire ABN AMRO’s retail 分页。。。businesses. ABN AMRO being the eighth-largest bank in Europe by assets, this was a big bite to swallow.3

Fortis was also heavily involved in structuring CDOs, for which it gathered subprime-mortgage-linked securities, holding them on its balance sheet until the securitization deal closed. Epitomizing these operations was the soon-tobe-notorious Timberwolf II deal. Its forerunner, Timberwolf, had closed in 2007 just before the subprime crisis struck. It was a collaboration between Goldman Sachs and Greywolf Capital Management, a Purchase, N.Y., financial firm run by a team of Goldman alumni. Bear Stearns’ two ill-fated hedge funds had invested heavily in Timberwolf, which lost more than 80 percent of its value within five months. Timberwolf was later immortalized by Michigan Senator Carl Levin, in a hearing of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations on conflicts of interest in the financial sector, as “one shitty deal” (Levin was in fact echoing an unflattering emailed remark by a Goldman executive).

By the time Greywolf Capital proposed Timberwolf II, Goldman had concluded that warehousing subprime-linked securities, as necessary for getting the deal off the ground, was too risky. But in Fortis, Greywolf found a less fastidious partner. Fortis lost more than $400 million on the securities it warehoused in preparation for Timberwolf II, a deal that never came to market.4 So much for the idea, repeated ad nauseam by European officials, that US banks were to blame for the excesses of the CDO market.

These problems may have been common knowledge among insiders, but the impact of Lehman’s failure on derivatives markets gave them additional salience. Shares in Fortis fell by 35 percent in the week ending on September 26, reducing its market valuation to €12 billion, barely half what it had just paid for its chunk of ABN AMRO. Fortis’ interim CEO Herman Verwilst then ill-advisedly used the “b word” (bankruptcy) in seeking to reassure investors, prompting withdrawals by business clients. Having fallen victim to foot in mouth disease, Verwilst was quickly put out to pasture, but the damage was done. The three Benelux governments stepped in over the weekend, injecting €11 billion of new share capital to keep Fortis afloat. As a condition, they demanded the resignation of Chairman Lippens. The Dutch government, as a matter of national pride, further required the upstart Belgian firm to sell off its stake in what was originally Dutch ABN AMRO.

There was then more bad news from Ireland the following Monday, when shares in the country’s six big banks fell by a third. Deposits were guaranteed up to €100,000, the Irish authorities having raised the limit from €20,000 a week earlier. But this did nothing to restore the banks’ access to wholesale money markets. Nor did a €100,000 guarantee reassure business customers with deposits vastly in excess of the ceiling.5 And there was yet more bad news from Brussels, where shares in Dexia, the big Franco-Belgian financial conglomerate that was one of Fortis’ principal competitors, also fell by a third. Dexia could trace its origins to the 1860s, when its progenitor, the Crédit Communal de Belgique, was founded to lend to municipal governments. (It almost seemed as if the older and more venerable the financial institution, the more risk it now took and the more excitement it created.) After more than a century of quietude, the Crédit Communal merged with its French counterpart, the Crédit Local de France, in 1996. The rebranded company then acquired the American firm Financial Security Assurance (FSA), whose business was providing credit enhancements—insurance policies—to boost the marketability of municipal bonds. What with local governments borrowing heavily on the municipal bond market, FSA quickly became Dexia’s most profitable division.

Dexia displayed all the defining financial characteristics of the era. Its assets were forty times core capital. Only 15 percent of its liabilities were customer deposits acquired through its retail banking network. It insured $400 billion of US municipal bonds and asset-backed securities and made a large loan to Depfa Bank, a German bank headquartered in Dublin that underwrote US municipal bonds with contracts containing AIG-style buyback triggers. It had a significant derivatives portfolio, forcing it to post additional collateral as the value of its investments declined. Its FSA unit had announced a $331 million net loss for the second quarter of 2008, and there was every reason to think that the third quarter would be worse.

Shares in Dexia plunged on the Monday after the Belgian, Dutch, and Luxembourg governments intervened in Fortis, and it too lost access to the wholesale money market. The French and Belgian governments responded on Tuesday by injecting €6.4 billion of emergency funding and sending off the firm’s management. Last but not least, there was Iceland. This small mid-Atlantic island better known for fish than finance had not registered on the sonar of many investors. There was some awareness that IceSave, the offshore brand of the Icelandic bank Landsbanki, offered high interest rates on Internet savings accounts to customers in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Kaupthing (in Icelandic, Kaupþing) Bank, the largest Icelandic bank, similarly offered Internet-based Kaupthing Edge accounts through its overseas subsidiaries and branches to customers in European jurisdictions from Luxembourg to the Isle of Man.6 Investors were aware that the three big Icelandic banks had embarked on an extraordinary acquisitions binge. But consciousness of what had transpired in Iceland became widespread only when things went dreadfully wrong.

There has been a tendency to ascribe the hyperfinancialization of the Icelandic economy to certain idiosyncrasies of national character.7 In a speech in London in 2005, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, the country’s long-serving president, ascribed the audacity of Iceland’s financiers and entrepreneurs to the fact that Icelanders were descended from the Vikings. The country had been a society of farmers and fishermen as recently as two decades earlier, when “necessity dictated that the fish catch had to be brought ashore and processed immediately when the boats came into harbour and that they had to be turned and collected when the weather was favorable,” bequeathing a strong work ethic.8 “Icelanders are risk takers,” Grímsson, in his celebration, continued. A successful fishing boat captain is self-confident, aggressive, and ready to take risks, these also being the attributes of a successful bond trader.

Turning Iceland into a financial center thus required only a government decision to privatize the fish catch, assign every fisherman a quota, and create a market on which those quotas could be traded. Aggressive Icelanders trading fishing quotas discovered that they apparently possessed a natural aptitude for trading financial claims. Soon the financial services boom was on. By 2008, bank assets were nearly ten times the size of GDP. This all but guaranteed that, sooner or later, the worst would come to pass.

A bit of reflection suggests that this story is too easy. Privatization of the fish catch occurred already in the 1970s, and the trading of quotas already in the 1980s. But as recently as 2003, bank assets as a share of GDP were only marginally higher than in the United States.9

From 2004 through the middle of 2008, the balance sheets of the three big Icelandic banks then rose by a cumulative factor of eight. What drove the boom were not quirks of national character but tangible policy decisions, the most important of which were privatizing and deregulating the banks. In 1994 Iceland joined Europe’s free-trade area, the European Economic Area, in order to strengthen its bargaining position in negotiations over fishing rights. But as a member of the free-trade area, it had to relax controls on capital flows. Hence it was no longer possible to maintain interest rates on bank deposits lower than those prevailing abroad. This forced deregulation of interest rates, which in turn created momentum for bank deregulation generally.

Ideology also played a role. The 1990s saw the ascendancy of a new generation of libertarian politicians who, reacting against the small island’s cozy state-run system, advocated a program of radical liberalization. Among them were Davíð Oddsson, from the conservative Independence Party, who served as prime minister from 1991 to 2004, minister of foreign affairs until late 2005, and then governor of the central bank from 2005 to 2009; and Hannes Hólmsteinn Gissurarson, a University of Iceland professor of political science and Hayek scholar, who, having previously written on fisheries management, in 1992 published a book describing how Iceland could transform itself into a global financial center. If there was a quirk of Icelandic national character, it was how quickly the dominant political ideology could shift between the extremes of statism and libertarianism—just as it shifted back after the crisis.

Support for the libertarian arguments of these young renegades was grounded in the backlash against the overly close connections between Icelandic government and business—in complaints that cronyism, in the sanitized Icelandic version, was rampant, and that the solution was to get the government out of business. Central to their program was privatization of three state banks: Landsbanki; Íslandsbanki, later renamed Glitnir; and Búnaðarbanki, which was subsequently purchased by a small bank, Kaupthing, and henceforth known by that name. Unfortunately, privatization and liberalization by themselves did not guarantee a reduced role for the state, much less that Iceland would miraculously transform itself into a world-class financial center. In a country of fewer than 300,000 residents, the incestuous connections between political elites and business managers that informed the backlash against the state-run economy were not eliminated; to the contrary, they had, if anything, even more scope to operate.

Be this as it may, the belief in light-touch regulation that informed policy toward the banking system in the US and UK found a happy home in Iceland. The speed of the shift meant that the owner-managers of what had until recently been public financial institutions possessed no firsthand experience or institutional memory of how badly things could go wrong. The regulators, meanwhile, were hopelessly understaffed, not unlike the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Freed to borrow on foreign money markets, the big three Icelandic banks did so with abandon. They used foreign funding to finance a wave of acquisitions, mainly in the Nordic countries and the UK. This by itself did not make the Icelandic case exceptional; banks in other European countries, including not least Germany, similarly relied on wholesale funding, and similarly embarked on an acquisitions binge.10 Rather, what made the Icelandic case an exception, and exceptionally risky, were a pair of additional features.

First, the banks’ balance sheets were inflated by their aggressive pursuit of offshore deposits and the rapid growth of IceSave and Kaupthing Edge accounts in particular. Put those offshore deposits together with the wholesale funding, and the result was an enormous banking system atop a tiny island economy. It was either the politicians’ and bankers’ dream of Iceland as an international financial center or a nightmare come true.

Second, more than 70 percent of the liabilities of the three big banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki, and Glitnir, were denominated in foreign currency. The banks claimed that they were prudently managing the risks of borrowing dollars, pounds, and euros by lending to firms and households in those same currencies. This of course neglected the possibility that the country’s exchange rate might weaken, in which case Icelandic firms and households with incomes in krona would be unable to repay their foreign currency loans.

It should have been clear that no loan book could grow so prodigiously without compromising quality. The banks were allowed to lend generously against housing collateral whose value had tripled since 2003 and against corporate shares whose prices were up by a factor of five, levels whose sustainability was, to put it mildly, questionable. They kept little in the way of a meaningful capital cushion. Many of their loans were to insiders, who used them to purchase additional shares in their own banks and finance other acquisitions.

As questions were asked—what was a small windswept island off the northwest coast of Europe doing with a banking system eight times GDP, and could balance sheets that had grown at such an extraordinary pace possibly weather the global economic downturn—the banks’ shares came under pressure. The banks’ owners responded, like Clarence Hatry, Bernard Marcus, and Albert Oustric before them, by purchasing their own shares so as to buy time and ward off evidence of insolvency. Starting in mid-2007, Kaupthing purchased its own shares whenever their prices ticked down and it could do so without being detected. It provided financing to Sheikh Mohammed Bin Khalifa Bin Hamad al-Thani of Qatar to buy a 5 percent stake and gave the Sheikh a guarantee against losses. Glitnir Bank made large loans to its principal owner, the Baugur Group, which used them to double its holdings of bank shares.11 In 2013 four executives of Kaupthing, including the CEO and board chairman, were convicted of fraud in connection with the Qatari transactions and sentenced to five years in jail. Investigations of other related transactions at Kaupthing and the two other big Icelandic banks are ongoing. Whatever their legality, these transactions were indicative of how desperate the banks’ owners, now also their managers, were to buy time in the gamble to stay alive.12

Already in 2006, a number of investment banks had issued negative reports on the Icelandic financial system, pointing to a worrisome pattern of cross-ownership between the banks and their big shareholders and clients. In 2007 a planeload of asset managers flown to Reykjavik by Barclays Capital came away worried by the country’s highly leveraged financial system. Informed by this experience, a group of fifty macro hedge funds organized by Drobny Global Advisors of Manhattan Beach, California, began shorting the krona and Icelandic financials. In April 2008, late once more to the game, Fitch placed Iceland’s big banks on negative watch. Thus, what followed was not wholly unexpected. On Thursday, September 25, 2008, against the background of turmoil in the United States and Europe, Glitnir, the smallest of the three big banks, informed the Central Bank of Iceland that it would be unable to meet payments on loans due on October 15. Glitnir was named after the goldand silver-encrusted hall of Forseti, the Norse god of law and justice, but no matter. Its balance sheet had been damaged by falling asset prices, and the bank now lost access to the wholesale money market. A big German state bank, Bayerische Landesbank, refused to roll over €150 million of loans, and Glitnir had nowhere else to come up with the money.13 Over the ensuing weekend, the Central Bank of Iceland considered extending the bank a €600 million loan but concluded that its collateral was inadequate; Glitnir was effectively insolvent. To prevent its collapse, the government announced the intention of injecting, via the central bank, some €600 million of new share capital, effectively nationalizing the institution.14

There was only one problem. €600 million was an enormous sum for a small economy. It was not clear, in other words, where the authorities would come up with the money. An analogous proportion of US GDP was $700 billion, equivalent to the entire TARP. In Iceland, this was now allocated to just a single bank, and not the largest one. Not to mention the further problem that the need to replace Glitnir’s foreign-currency-denominated borrowings, soon to mature, would exhaust the central bank’s reserves of foreign exchange.

If they had not had it before, investors had reason now to question the Icelandic banking model. On Tuesday, September 30, Fitch downgraded the three big Icelandic banks, citing their reliance on wholesale funding, rapid expansion into overseas markets, and the possibility of a hard landing for the Icelandic economy.15 Doubting the adequacy of the sovereign backstop, depositors rushed to withdraw their funds not just from Glitnir but from Kaupthing and Landsbanki as well.

It did not help that Landsbanki had made loans to finance the purchase of shares in the now-bankrupt Glitnir by the bank’s recent owners. Nor did it help that the exchange rate fell sharply on the news of Glitnir’s difficulties, raising doubts about Kaupthing and Landsbanki’s loan books. The ECB had extended loans to the three banks’ Luxembourg subsidiaries against collateral denominated in Icelandic krona; it now demanded additional margin.16 The final straw came when the British Financial Services Authority instructed Kaupthing’s UK subsidiary to keep liquid funds in London equal to 95 percent of its Edge account liabilities, preventing the subsidiary from helping the parent with its liquidity needs.

Within days, all three big Icelandic banks had collapsed. If it had been unclear before where the government would find the funds to recapitalize Glitnir, it was even less clear now how it could save the big three, whose combined liabilities were more than eight times national income. Printing money was no answer, since this would do nothing to address the fact that the bulk of the banks’ liabilities were denominated in dollars, euros, and sterling.

This left only forcing losses on the banks’ creditors. On October 6, the day before the Landsbanki bankruptcy, Iceland’s Parliament, the Althing, adopted a measure guaranteeing all deposit accounts of residents.17 But this measure said nothing about the banks’ other creditors, be they institutional investors holding the bonds of the banks or Dutch and British households with IceSave and Kaupthing Edge accounts. When the government then split Landsbanki into a new government-owned institution, whose Icelandic assets, acquired in part by earlier foreign borrowing, fully covered its deposit liabilities to residents, and old Landsbanki, whose assets were only a fraction of its liabilities, the implication was clear.

The collapse of the banks was a shock to Iceland’s self-image. It was a shock most of all to the banks’ creditors, the most visible of whom was the pop star Bubbi Morthens. Known locally as the Icelandic Bruce Springsteen, Morthens was second only to Björk as an Icelandic pop icon. Notwithstanding the fact that one of his bands was called Das Kapital, Morthens had followed the example of David Bowie by securitizing his royalties. But he had the bad luck to securitize them through Glitnir and the bad judgment to invest the proceeds in the bank’s securities. The notion that it made sense to turn a stream of songwriting royalties into an unhedged bet on a highly leveraged bank was indicative of the prevalent Icelandic belief that the route to riches ran through finance. Morthens’ shares were written down by 85 percent with Glitnir’s partial nationalization. When it became clear that the bank was broke, his holdings were wiped out. Morthens played a series of free concerts to dramatize the plight of the bank’s creditors. His was a doleful tune. Iceland’s insurance fund ostensibly guaranteed deposits, including Landsbanki’s IceSave and Kaupthing’s Edge accounts, up to €20,877 per customer per bank as required by the European Economic Area legislation that authorized the banks to operate elsewhere in Europe.18 But this was cold comfort, as Shakespeare would have said, apropos of Iceland, given that the resources to make good on the guarantee were not there. Payments into the guarantee fund had been set on the basis of deposits at the end of the previous year, which hardly sufficed in a period when deposits were growing exponentially. In any case, the architects of the guarantee fund had not foreseen the wholesale collapse of the financial system.

If British households were unmindful of such details, the same was not true of the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority. On Friday, October 3, the FSA effectively seized the UK operations of Landsbanki and Kaupthing, placing their funds into a segregated account at the Bank of England, and instructed their Icelandic parents to come up with more money for these accounts. On the Tuesday morning following, the Icelandic Minister of Finance, Árni M. Mathiesen, informed the UK chancellor, Alisdair Darling, that the Icelandic government, now the de facto owner of the banks, might not be able to come up with this kind of money.

Mathiesen’s answer should not have come as a surprise, since British households’ $5 billion of IceSave accounts were nearly 50 percent of Icelandic GDP. As Davíð Oddsson observed from his perch at the central bank, so burdening Icelandic citizens’ children and grandchildren “would be slavery for other people’s fault.”19 The “other people” to whom Oddsson was alluding included not himself, of course, but other Icelandic bankers, British depositors unable to resist the lure of suspiciously high interest rates, and a British regulator that had done nothing to restrain them.

Already the website of the UK IceSave operation was overwhelmed by traffic. It was closed down along with Landsbanki on October 7, leaving depositors in the lurch. This led to one of the more ignominious chapters in the crisis as the British authorities invoked the UK Anti-Terrorism, Crime, and Security Act to seize Landsbanki’s UK assets, ostensibly to protect those customers. The Anti-Terrorism Act was passed in the wake of September 11 to help Britain’s security apparatus pursue foreigners bent on violent acts. Compensating the holders of Internet bank accounts was presumably not what members of Parliament had in mind. Be this as it may, the act was now used by Gordon Brown to comfort his public.

Placing Iceland on a list with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, Sudan, North Korea, and Iran caused a freeze on banking transactions between Iceland and other countries. The stock market was shut. The foreign exchange market was closed, leaving the Central Bank of Iceland to provide foreign exchange for essential purposes only. To angry Icelanders, it seemed like a replay of the “cod wars,” the dispute over fishing rights with the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Some 20 percent of Iceland’s population signed an online petition decrying the British government’s action. Thousands of Icelanders posted self-portraits to the web. Each held a handmade sign reading: “I am not a terrorist, Mr. Brown.”20 In 2009, when Britain chaired the Group of Twenty, Brown would seek to position himself as the orchestrator of international cooperation. He would have a lot of positioning to do.
