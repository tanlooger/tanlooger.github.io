title: Chapter 10 Will America Topple Too?
---



Through may and June, Germany insisted it was not Austria. Britain and the United States now insisted they were not Germany. This, however, did not stop the crisis from leapfrogging first the channel and then the Atlantic. Where the German crisis developed over the better part of two years, it took just weeks to reach London, and only days after that to infect New York.

Harrison, having experienced the failure of the Bank of United States, understood the urgency of offering Germany assistance to keep the crisis from spreading. Norman, in contrast, not having experienced a major bank failure on his watch, adopted a harder line. With hindsight, we know that Norman should have been more concerned about the condition of British banks that had extended credit to German exporters and about the attrition of his reserves. But having been under pressure for months, he was on the verge of exhaustion. On July 28 he collapsed, remaining confined to bed for a week. On August 15, in the company of his sister, Mrs. Agnes Chalmers, he boarded a liner for Canada. There he remained through much of September, in only limited telegraphic and wireless contact with London.1

Norman’s condition may help to explain why the Bank of England failed to act decisively as its reserves drained away.2 In his absence, policy was made by committee, and committees take time to agree. Another factor was that the Bank of England faced the same dilemma as the Reichsbank, namely whether to defend the exchange rate or support the economy, but not having suffered through the same debilitating inflation it made the other choice. Joblessness was a concern, with 22 percent of individuals who were covered by the unemployment insurance scheme out of work. A Labour government committed to restoration of full employment had been in power since 1929. To raise rates 分页。。。under these circumstances threatened to antagonize that government and undermine public support for the central bank. Ralph Hawtrey, probably the economist with the subtlest mind in H.M. Treasury, understood. “To raise the rate when unemployment among insured work people had risen to 22 per cent, was surely to gild the lily,” he later explained. “If, in the language of 1848, the price of the convertibility of the note was to be a further disemployment of labour, the position had become untenable. And in fact it had.”3

Then there was the weakness of the banks. London’s privately held investment banks, or merchant banks as they were known for their practice of lending to merchants engaged in overseas trade, had guaranteed bills issued by German firms anticipating export receipts. Once bills were so guaranteed, they could be sold on to other investors. In normal circumstances this was easy money; the bank made a commission, and instances when it was necessary to deliver on the guarantee were rare. The resemblance to the credit default swaps issued as insurance by banks eighty years later is more than skin-deep.

But circumstances in 1931 were hardly normal. An unsettled foreign exchange market made it hard to sell German bills to other investors, forcing the banks to warehouse them on their own balance sheets. And in the summer, following the Creditanstalt and Danatbank crises, payments by Austrian and German firms to their foreign creditors were frozen. The fact that the banks possessed little liquidity to spare had just been highlighted by the Macmillan Committee, the group of bankers, economists, and other experts, including Keynes, set up in 1929 to investigate the connections between trade and industry.4 In some cases, moreover, the problem was more than just liquidity. The credits that the three largest investment banks in London, Kleinworts, Schroeders, and Hambros, had extended to German firms engaged in import and export trade exceeded their paid-in capital, or partners’ equity, which was the only way of absorbing losses. If their loans to Austrian and German firms were not repaid, these banks were effectively broke.5

Norman himself was a onetime merchant banker, having helped to lead the firm Brown Shipley, where his maternal grandfather had been a partner. So were a number of other Bank of England directors. These men understood the banks’ problems. They knew that the joint-stock banks (commercial banks to Americans, clearing banks in British parlance) had made large short-term loans to merchant banks desperate for liquidity. The problem, they realized, affected the entire British financial system.

The condition of the banks helps to explain why the Bank of England made no further changes in its discount rate after July, despite gold continuing to drain away. Instead it made an exception to the practice of lending only against good collateral, agreeing to discount bills backed by frozen German debts.6 This was not unlike what the Federal Reserve and the ECB did in 2008 when they loosened their collateral requirements to support the financial system. But it was the opposite of what a central bank that was committed to halting gold losses would have done.

For currency speculators, there was no question of what bet to make in this light. It was to borrow sterling and present it to the Bank of England for conversion into gold. The central bank might raise interest rates to make borrowing more costly. But if it hesitated, more speculators would join the queue. It would consequently be forced to suspend convertibility and allow the pound to depreciate against gold and foreign currencies. Speculators could then buy back at a lower price the sterling they had previously sold.7

Unwilling to raise the discount rate given the weakness of the banks and the economy, the Bank of England’s only recourse was to sell francs and dollars in an effort to inflict losses on traders who had done the opposite. If those traders, who had borrowed the sterling they used to buy francs and dollars, suffered losses as the bank now sought to drive sterling up and the franc and dollar down, their lenders might hit them with margin calls, or demand early repayment. By “squeezing” the bears in this way, the central bank hoped to drive them out of the market.

The Bank of France used the same tactic, with some success, when the franc was under attack in the 1920s. But interest rates then were relatively high. Borrowing was expensive, and those who borrowed money to speculate in currencies had to show results quickly. Now, in contrast, interest rates were low, and speculators could afford to finance their positions. If their lenders demanded more cash, they could find it. As a result, they could afford to wait out the central bank.

In the meantime, selling francs and dollars only accelerated the depletion of the central bank’s reserves. The Bank of England first reported gold losses on July 13, the day of Danatbank’s failure. Over the subsequent two and a half weeks it lost some £30 million of reserves, amounting to roughly 25 percent of what it still possessed. Britain had not entered the crisis with a budget deficit (shades of Spain in 2007). The Labour government sought to establish that it was a responsible fiscal steward by toeing a cautious fiscal line. However, revenues fell off as the slump deepened, while spending on unemployment compensation rose. Already debt servicing costs were heavy: the debt-to-GDP ratio approached 200 percent in 1931 as a result of obligations incurred during World War I and then deflation in the 1920s. Although the government’s debt was heavy, it was not unmanageable. The situation was not unlike that of Japan in the early twenty-first century. If debt service costs could be brought down in line with lower global interest rates, and if the growth rate of national income could be pushed up, then the debt-toGDP ratio could be held at a sustainable level. But with a high exchange rate and restrictive financial policy, the outlook for GDP growth was dim.

This left only austerity as a way of squaring the circle and, it was hoped, restoring confidence in the government’s finances and the economy. A six-person “supercommittee” to investigate the problem was set up under the chairmanship of Sir George May, the recently retired secretary of the Prudential Assurance Company, whose reputation as Britain’s leading actuary evidently qualified him for the role. The committee’s two Conservative and two Liberal members agreed that balancing the budget was essential for restoring confidence. The only feasible way of doing so, given the “unduly large” burden of taxation, they concluded, was by reducing public spending.

Their conclusion was not entirely unexpected. The Conservative motion in the House of Commons calling for establishment of the committee had tasked it with making recommendations for “effecting forthwith all practicable and legitimate reductions in the national expenditure.” The majority’s recommendations thus focused on reducing unemployment benefits and the salaries of constables, teachers, and members of the armed forces. The committee’s two Labour members dissented but did not offer a concrete alternative.

The Labour cabinet was unable to endorse the majority report, foundering on the committee’s recommendation to cut unemployment benefits. But neither was it able to agree on other measures. The government was therefore dissolved on August 24 in favor of a government of national unity dominated by Conservatives but headed, awkwardly, by the Labour prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald. (For his efforts, MacDonald was expelled from the Labour Party.) The new government agreed on budgetary economies and, by so doing, was able to secure an £80 million loan from a foreign bank syndicate headed by J. P. Morgan.

But the failure of these measures, introduced on September 10, to restore confidence and stem the Bank of England’s gold losses indicates that the budget was not the fundamental problem. The deficit was as much a consequence as a cause of the crisis. The problem was rather the weakness of the economy and the banks, which prevented the Bank of England from prioritizing defense of the sterling parity. This was not a problem that balancing the budget, in and of itself, could solve. To the contrary, austerity only served to aggravate it.

The contradiction surfaced when the May Committee’s recommendation to reduce salaries for the armed forces provoked unrest in the ranks. On September 15 sailors on the Royal Navy’s Atlantic Fleet anchored in Cromarty Firth near the Scottish port of Invergordon refused to fall in for duty, and four ships were unable to leave harbor. This was passive resistance rather than mutiny on the high seas, but the headline writers did not make such careful distinctions. Investors were quick to imagine wider civil disobedience. When ministers then indicated during Parliamentary question time willingness to compromise with the “mutineers,” they did not reassure investors of their commitment to stay the budgetary course.

All this had the predictable effect of accelerating the run on the pound. The contradictions of British economic policy, which emphasized austerity in an unprecedented slump, made the outcome unavoidable.

After the drama of the summer, the final chapter was anticlimactic. On the evening of September 20, its reserves approaching the legal minimum, the Bank of England announced that it was suspending the convertibility of sterling into gold. On Monday, Parliament passed the Gold Standard (Amendment) Act, validating this fait accompli. But there was little sense of impending calamity. Investors, and more broadly British society, heaved a collective sigh of relief. The exchange rate against the dollar fell by 20 percent, where it stabilized. That was it in terms of immediate repercussions. From London’s standpoint, the outcome was surprisingly benign. Not so from New York’s. Britain’s suspension of gold convertibility challenged the belief that there was such a thing as a safe haven. If one of the world’s two financial powers could abandon the gold standard, then it was not inconceivable that the other might do the same. “Everywhere men asked,” in the words of Lawrence Sullivan in his contemporary account of the crisis, “ ‘Will America topple too?”8

Uncertain of the answer, currency speculators trained their sights on the dollar. They were joined by central banks rushing to liquidate the deposits they held in New York. The Bank of England had reassured its fellow central banks that sterling would not be allowed to depreciate. Gérard Vissering, the head of the Netherlands Bank, had phoned the Bank of England on Friday, September 18, to sound out his British colleagues, two days prior to the suspension and resulting depreciation. Reassured that its holdings of sterling were safe, the Dutch central bank maintained its position. The devaluation cost the Netherlands Bank dearly, and it cost Dr. Vissering his job.

Having been fooled once, central banks were not willing to be fooled again. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York described the subsequent rush for the exits as “the most rapid outflow of gold experienced by this country and probably by any country.”9 Especially egregious was the conversion of dollars into gold by the Bank of France, the European bank with the largest foreign currency reserves. Hoover was furious, suspecting French payback for his reparations moratorium. He was hard-pressed to contain his anger when hosting French Premier Laval at a White House dinner in October. According to Henry Stimson, Hoover’s secretary of state, Hoover held the French premier personally responsible. Not that Laval’s humor was much better, given the earlier spat over the president’s reparations plan.

Unlike the UK, the United States had not suspended the gold standard during or after World War I, and it was not prepared to suspend it now. On October 8, the directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York voted to raise the discount rate from 1½ to 2½ percent, and the board approved. A week later New York raised its rate again, this time to 3½ percent. The other Reserve banks quickly followed.10 Doing so made borrowing to speculate against the dollar more expensive. But by making credit more costly, it also aggravated banking-sector problems.

The most immediate problems now centered on Chicago.11 The preceding decade had seen explosive growth in the city’s outer suburbs, known as the Bungalow Belt. The growth of these new neighborhoods of low-rise homes on wide lots with space for garages reflected the same factors feeding the Florida property boom, namely cheap credit and the automobile. But in contrast to Florida, Illinois law made no reference to branch banking. Long before, in 1843, the state had experienced a disruptive crisis with the failure of the State Bank of Illinois and its half-dozen branches. The law’s silence was interpreted subsequently as prohibiting branching. New suburbs therefore relied on new banks for financial services. Not a few of those new banks were chartered by the same real estate moguls who developed the suburbs they now served. They lent aggressively for property development and, in 1920s fashion, repackaged and sold their loans as mortgage bonds.

The longer-established banks of the Loop felt compelled to compete, which they did by lending for commercial real estate development and issuing single-property bonds. Moreover, they offered, in the manner of the Bank of United States, to repurchase those bonds from unsatisfied investors. As mortgage defaults piled up, bondholders sought to collect on the promise. In June 1931 several banks announced that, due to unforeseen circumstances, they were unable to keep it. Those announcements raising obvious concerns, their depositors began to run. June 8 saw a run on the Foreman Group of banks. (If Illinois law was interpreted as prohibiting branch banking, it did not prevent group or chain banking in the manner of Tennessee.) Runs quickly engulfed other banks downtown and in the suburbs. Newspaper reports ignited sympathetic panics in Toledo and elsewhere.

Against this backdrop, Britain’s abandonment of the gold standard and the Fed’s discount rate increases exacted a toll. Bank closures followed not just in Chicago but in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Youngstown, and other cities. Aside from standing ready to discount eligible paper, the Philadelphia, Chicago, and Cleveland Reserve banks did little to help the distressed institutions. Instead the imperative of defending the gold standard carried the day. Virtually the only figure within the Federal Reserve System to push for more aggressive action to help the banks was Owen D. Young in his capacity as director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.12 These financial problems were another blow to American companies struggling to keep their heads above water. Interest rates paid on prime commercial paper, which reputable firms relied on to finance themselves, now rose by an additional 2 percentage points. The spread between AAA and Baa bonds, which measures the premium riskier corporations have to pay in order to borrow, widened further. Wholesale prices fell by an additional 5 percent between July and December. Unable to borrow, firms and households cut back. Industrial production fell by 10 percent over the second half of the year. This was a repeat of the disastrous experience of the second half of 1930, imposed now on an economy even less able to bear it.

Moreover, whereas in 1930 acute distress had been limited to the United States and Germany, it was felt virtually everywhere in the final months of 1931. Everywhere prices were falling. There were failures of systemically significant banks not just in the United States but across Central and Eastern Europe and, significantly, now even in Europe’s once-strong economy, France.

Governments came under pressure to do something, anything. For members of the British Commonwealth and Scandinavian countries with close economic ties to the UK, this meant following Britain off gold. No longer obliged to defend a particular level for the exchange rate, their central banks could cut interest rates to support their struggling economies.

The newfound flexibility similarly allowed them to better support their banks. Of the two dozen countries going off gold in 1931, only one, Sweden, suffered a banking crisis subsequently. The Swedish exception reflected the death, apparently by suicide, of the colorful industrialist Ivar Kreuger and the collapse of his financial empire. Even then, the failure of Kreuger’s lender, the Skandinaviska Kreditaktiebolaget, did not spark a general panic since the Swedish state now had the wherewithal to sort out the mess.13 Eastern Europe opted to follow Germany and Austria, declaring debt moratoria and imposing exchange controls. Latin America, not knowing which example to emulate, abandoned the gold standard and suspended debt-service payments both, at the same time. In the United States, in contrast, balanced-budget doctrine and gold-standard ideology still carried the day. Andrew Mellon, who swore by the banker’s canon as faithfully as anyone, was by now President Hoover’s longest-serving cabinet member. Mellon continued to insist that by embracing fiscal and financial rectitude and limiting government intervention, confidence could be restored. But this approach, embraced by his president, did nothing to break the diabolic loop between declining spending and banking problems. For this failure as much as anything, Hoover’s term came to be seen as a failed presidency.

Notwithstanding the scorn heaped on him subsequently, Hoover did not entirely fail to grasp the problem. He understood that if banks did not lend, farmers would not plant, firms would not invest, and households would not spend. Without measures restoring confidence in the banks, in other words, recovery was unlikely.

Unfortunately, the banking crisis in the second half of 1931 indicated that the Reserve banks were not capable of such measures. Many troubled banks were not members of the Federal Reserve System, and many member banks lacked eligible commercial bills to pledge to the Fed. In any case, most directors of the twelve Federal Reserve banks did not see the resolution of banking problems as their responsibility.

Hoover, on the other hand, may have understood what needed to be done, but this didn’t mean he wanted government to do it. He preferred self-help to intervention by the Federal Reserve, or for that matter by any agency of government. Having been raised a Quaker, he subscribed to the doctrine of neighborly self-reliance. The crisis was best addressed, in his view, by organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Association of Bankers. This had been the president’s response to the stock market crash, when he exhorted business organizations to maintain the prevailing level of wages and labor unions to forgo strikes. It was similarly his response now.

Hoover’s plan for dealing with the banking crisis was thus to solicit contributions to a voluntary pool known as the National Credit Corporation (NCC). Participating banks would contribute an amount equal to 2 percent of their deposits and in return qualify for assistance. The corporation’s loan decisions would be made not by the government but by committees of local bankers. With more liquid banks aiding their less liquid brethren, the latter would regain the capacity to lend.

This would not be unlike the interbank cooperation organized during the 1907 crisis, with leadership from J. Pierpont Morgan and help from Benjamin Strong. On that occasion, the failure of the Knickerbocker Trust Company had undermined confidence in other New York City banks, causing banks in the rest of the country, which customarily placed deposits of their own in New York, to withdraw those funds. While the insolvent Knickerbocker Trust was allowed to go under, the stronger New York banks pooled their resources and lent them to their weaker but solvent peers. They also issued clearinghouse certificates—essentially, promissory notes they agreed to accept from one another in payment—to ensure that solvent banks would have adequate liquidity.14 In this way the 1907 crisis was resolved. Indeed, this was not the first time this approach to stemming a banking panic was tried. In fact this kind of cooperation was commonplace before 1913, as President Hoover himself was now quick to observe.15

The meeting on Sunday, October 9, where Hoover presented his plan was secret to avoid raising even greater alarm about the condition of the banks. It was held not at the White House but at the apartment of Secretary Mellon. The familiar cast of characters included Thomas Lamont from J. P. Morgan, Albert Wiggin from Chase National Bank, and Charles Mitchell from National City Bank, along with Hoover, Mellon, and Treasury Undersecretary Ogden Mills.

The bankers were not enthused. Weak banks, they observed, were in no position to contribute 2 percent of their assets to a common pool. Strong ones would be subsidizing their weaker brethren. In other words, the bankers understood that the problem was not just one of liquidity; many distressed banks were insolvent. For the solvent to lend to their insolvent brethren would be throwing good money after bad. Bankers in a position to contribute wanted the association’s loans to be collateralized but recognized that distressed banks lacked good collateral.16 In effect, good collateral was something that only the government possessed. George Harrison had brought these problems to Hoover’s attention already on Friday, October 7, but Hoover’s belief in the power of self-help was too strong for him to modify his plan.

Friedman and Schwartz attribute the absence of mutual support on the part of the banks to the existence of the Federal Reserve. Rather than providing mutual support as they had before 1914, the bankers now expected the central bank to bail them out. This analysis suggests otherwise. The events of 1931 were both different from and more serious than the liquidity crises that had occurred prior to 1914. 1931 was a crisis of solvency in which outside help was essential. These were not circumstances under which voluntarism could carry the day.

In the event, Hoover’s National Credit Corporation made only $10 million of loans through the end of the year, reflecting lack of adequate collateral and the big bankers’ lack of sympathy for their smaller, more troubled counterparts. One is reminded of the Public-Private Partnership Investment Program for Legacy Assets of 2009, under which the government sought to get private investors to buy the toxic paper on bank balance sheets, though here too little came of it.17 At this point, not even Hoover could deny that government intervention was required. The next election was less than a year away, which was enough to convince even an incumbent committed to voluntarism that this was no time to stand on principle.

Conveniently, a model was at hand in the form of the War Finance Corporation (WFC), created by Congress in 1918 to make loans to industries and banks finding it difficult to borrow in wartime. The WFC was repurposed as an emergency finance corporation for making loans to banks, industries, and local credit agencies during the recession of 1920–21, and then to help farmers struggling with low crop prices. Although it had been dissolved in 1929, there was now a powerful argument for resurrecting it.

The case was made by Eugene Meyer, the same banker who previously ran the WFC, worked on Hoover’s debt moratorium, and now served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Extraordinarily for a central banker, Meyer himself drafted the enabling legislation. The agency as he designed it would lend not just to banks but to railroads, whose bonds weighed on the portfolios of the banks, and to farmers, whose pleas resounded on Capitol Hill. Meyer had made his fortune buying and selling railway securities, something that may have been more than incidentally connected with the plan’s favorable treatment of the latter.

The bill establishing what came to be known as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) was introduced into the Congress on December 7 and signed into law on January 22, 1932. By February 2, with a skeletal staff of former employees of the WFC, the RFC was up and running. The Treasury supplied $500 million of capital and was prepared to issue an additional $1.5 billion of bonds on the corporation’s behalf.18

Hoover picked Meyer to chair the RFC’s bipartisan board and Charles Dawes, of Dawes Plan fame, as president of the corporation. This was only the latest turn in the Dawes revolving door. Dawes had recently resigned, to Washington’s surprise, as ambassador to the Court of St. James. (He was succeeded by Andrew Mellon, who was in this way gracefully put out to pasture.) Speculation was rife that Dawes might challenge Hoover for the Republican nomination. Not only did appointing him to the RFC put a prominent banker and public statesman at the helm, but for Hoover it was a way of occupying a potential rival. The fact of the matter was that Dawes had bigger fish to fry. He had reason to be concerned about the survival of his family’s Chicago banking empire, something of which Hoover appears to have been unaware. For Dawes, the RFC was an ideal perch from which to gather intelligence on the condition of the banking system and cultivate political contacts. Unlike the ill-fated NCC, the RFC made extensive loans, conflicts between big and small bankers not inhibiting it. But like the NCC, the RFC required good collateral. As a result, only banks possessing it were able to borrow. The RFC thus did little to address solvency problems. If the banks and the economy were going to receive significant help, it would have to come from elsewhere, namely from the Federal Reserve. Congress helped by giving the central bank more room for maneuver. The Fed was constrained by the shortage of eligible securities—good collateral—against which to provide credit. The Federal Reserve Act required it to hold collateral, or back its note issue, with either gold or commercial paper generated in the course of business transactions, consonant with the real bills doctrine. Economic activity having been in decline for more than two years, partly because of the Fed’s earlier reluctance to do more about it, there was now a shortage of business transactions to produce commercial paper eligible to be held as backing for Federal Reserve notes. This might force the central bank to contract the note issue or, even worse in the eyes of officials, abandon the gold standard.

In February 1932, Mellon’s successor as treasury secretary, Ogden Mills, warned Hoover that the country was within weeks of being forced off the gold standard owing to the shortage of eligible securities. Hoover convened an emergency meeting of Harrison, Meyer, and Dawes, who agreed that the solution was legislation, which the president invited Senator Carter Glass and Representative Henry Steagall, chairmen of their respective chambers’ banking committees, to draft. Their bill modifying the supposedly sacrosanct gold standard, allowing the Fed to discount a wider range of securities, passed on February 27 without debate.19 Crises have a way of concentrating the mind.

The Fed was now free to take proactive steps to make credit more freely available. More than that, it was compelled to do so. Senator Elmer Thomas, Democrat of Oklahoma, was advancing legislation to require the Fed to print $2.4 billion of banknotes. Under the Thomas Plan, the government would sell bonds in that amount to the Reserve banks, and the Reserve banks would issue a corresponding amount of new currency notes. Thomas was a disciple of William Jennings Bryan, for whom he had campaigned in 1896. Concerned for the farmers and ranchers whom he saw as being crucified on a latter-day cross of gold, Thomas pressed for a “stabilized” or “honest” dollar. He was able to make common cause with another group of congressmen seeking immediate payment of the bonus previously promised World War I veterans, who figured that the new bank notes could be used to fund bonus payments. Not for the last time did politics shape monetary policy.

These domestic politics notwithstanding, Federal Reserve officials worried that such inflationary measures would be poorly received abroad. The French, in particular, would be quick to grasp the incompatibility of inflation with the dollar-franc exchange rate, prompting them to liquidate their dollar balances. Harrison warned his colleagues of the danger. Better than courting it, he suggested, was to initiate a modest program of monetary expansion using the room provided by Glass-Steagall and thereby head off congressional insistence to do more. Limited measures might alleviate the pressure applied by the likes of Senator Thomas without at the same time exciting the French.

This the Fed now set out to do, with New York’s leadership, purchasing treasury securities on the open market, first at the modest rate of $25 million a week and from April at a more ambitious $100 million weekly, providing the markets with a corresponding amount of cash. The New York Fed might have done more but for its gold problem. Each Reserve bank held its own gold reserves. Each conducted its own open market purchases, subject now to approval by the Board. But the New York Fed was the branch to which foreigners turned when they demanded gold. The New York bank therefore saw its gold-cover ratio (essentially, the ratio of gold in its vaults to its notes and other liabilities in circulation) fall in June to less than 50 percent. This was already dangerously close, in the view of Harrison and his colleagues, to the 40 percent minimum permitted by the Federal Reserve Act. The directors of the New York bank therefore were compelled to limit the rate of purchase.

Securities purchases continued at this moderate pace through the first half of the summer. In August, the House and Senate then recessed for the summer holiday and fall election. The pressure on the Fed was off. Open market purchases were halted. But they had not been without effect in the interim. Prices had stabilized, and certain lines of production, motor vehicles for example, had actually risen. But these now fell back. And banking problems returned with a vengeance. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, unlike the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, still had ample gold reserves. By transferring some of the excess to New York, it might have allowed the New York bank and the system to ramp up their securities purchases. But the Chicago bank under James McDougal had long been critical of New York’s activism. McDougal, recall, had objected to Benjamin Strong’s internationally motivated interest-rate reductions in 1927. He now rebuffed requests to transfer his excess gold to New York. The board could have compelled him to do so, but it was aware that McDougal had other problems. June saw runs on some three dozen banks in Greater Chicago. These were mainly neighborhood banks in the Bungalow Belt, as in 1931. But there was an important exception: Central Republic Trust, a big Loop bank headed by none other than Charles Dawes.

Dawes tendered his resignation as the RFC head just days before Central Republic’s problems broke into the open. He was aware that his family bank was in trouble and would almost certainly need help. Dawes himself, as a sometime government official, owned only a few shares in the bank, but his family firm, Dawes Brothers, Inc., was its single largest shareholder; Central Republic Trust was known as “the Dawes Bank.” Along with its investments in real estate, Central Republic had lent heavily to a group of companies controlled by Samuel Insull, who monopolized the provision of electricity and gas to the households, manufacturing firms, and urban railways of Greater Chicago. Insull got his start as secretary to Thomas Edison’s agent in London and then worked as Edison’s private secretary in New York. In the 1880s, while still in his twenties, he helped to arrange financing for Edison’s pioneering electrical utility franchises. Insull became a vice president of Edison General Electric when it was formed in 1889, second vice president of the General Electric Company in 1892, and then president of the Chicago Edison Company shortly thereafter. Chicago Edison was a small company at the time, but one with significant growth potential, since residents of Greater Chicago were still almost entirely unserved by electricity.

After twenty years of growing Chicago Edison, Insull formed the Middle West Utilities Company to buy up utility providers in neighboring communities and states. Middle West Utilities was a major beneficiary of the electrification boom of the 1920s, when manufacturing production, not to mention urban life, was revolutionized by the new power source. The low interest rates and easy credit of the period made it easy for Insull to finance his acquisitions. By 1932, Middle West Utilities controlled more than a hundred companies providing electricity to five thousand towns. Insull financed some of his acquisitions by issuing equity, but even more by borrowing, notably in the form of short-term loans from banks. Prominent among them was Central Republic, run by the Dawes family, which like Insull had an interest in promoting the growth of Chicago. It did not hurt that Dawes and Insull socialized together or that Insull contributed to the campaigns of Republican politicians on Dawes’ recommendation.20

The Depression had a predictable negative impact on Insull’s highly leveraged operation. The demand for electricity and utility company revenues declined. By April 1932, Insull’s companies were filing for bankruptcy, creating problems for their bankers. Because Insull had organized his holdings as a collection of separate companies rather than one integrated unit, banks were able to disregard provisions of the state banking code intended to limit their exposure to any one borrower to 15 percent of its share capital (the amount of money the owners committed to the bank’s operation).21 When Insull’s companies filed for bankruptcy protection, Central Republic’s $12 million of loans to his companies and affiliates in fact amounted to more than 50 percent of its capital.22 Management was either exceptionally sloppy or too closely connected to Insull for its own good.

Initially the hope was that the bankruptcy receiver would find the resources needed to pay the bankers what they were owed. Insull’s companies controlled actual power plants that supplied actual electricity to actual customers. But as the receiver uncovered a growing list of irregularities, it became apparent that any such assets would be dwarfed by Insull’s debts. In early June, Insull fled for the safety of Paris. On June 22 the news that he had arrived there, superimposed on the drumbeat of bank failures in the Bungalow Belt, ignited the run on Central Republic.23 This was the backdrop against which Dawes warned thirty of his fellow bankers, assembled at Central Republic’s Chicago headquarters on Friday, June 24, 1932, that his bank would be unable to open its doors the following Monday, absent assistance. By this point there was only one place from which such assistance could come, namely the RFC. The optics were unfortunate, Dawes until recently having headed up that self-same federal agency. He therefore let one of his Chicago banking colleagues, Melvin Traylor of the First National Bank, lead the negotiations.

Traylor cultivated a spic-and-span image. He was born literally in a log cabin, and as president of First National he still lived in a modest frame house near Lincoln Park. But Traylor’s bank also had loans to Insull’s companies, so he was not exactly disinterested. He was allied with Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak and politically connected at the national level, having served on the American delegation to the conference that established the Bank for International Settlements. Thus, delegating the negotiations to Traylor did not prevent angry members of Congress from crying cronyism.

The decision to extend the loan, taken over a weekend under intense time pressure, was made at the highest level. President Hoover himself helped organize it, the directors of the RFC being on holiday or at the Democratic National Convention, as it happened, in Chicago. Nothing could have embarrassed a sitting president more than to appear to have fomented a crisis in the city where the opposition was holding its nominating convention. In 2008, when the government scrambled to rescue Bear Stearns, not just the president of the New York Fed but the treasury secretary was involved in negotiations.24 That the President of the United States helped to orchestrate the government rescue of Central Republic was more remarkable still.

The rescue of Central Republic resembled the rescue of Bear Stearns in other ways as well. As in the case of Bear Stearns, the decision to offer assistance was taken in the belief that the bank was too big and connected to fail—that allowing it to collapse would ignite a nationwide panic. As in the case of Bear Stearns, the size of the rescue, $90 million, was unprecedented. Not only was this the single largest loan the RFC had made, but it was three times the size of all the loans the Federal government made to the states in 1932 for relief for the unemployed and homeless. As in the rescue of Bear Stearns, normal procedures were short-circuited. There is no evidence that the officers of Central Republic were even required to complete the standard loan application.

As in the case of Bear Stearns, there was controversy about whether the agency in question had exceeded its authority in extending the loan. The RFC was authorized to lend only if it expected that it would be repaid—that is, only if it believed that the bank it was helping was solvent. The RFC’s inspectors had their doubts, just as examiners in 2008 had their doubts about Bear Stearns. Lobbying by Traylor and Jesse Jones, an influential RFC director who, conveniently, was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention and on the scene, convinced Hoover and the RFC to go ahead.

The RFC’s bazooka reassured depositors. Although as many as twenty-six other Chicago banks, mainly small ones associated with a local real estate developer by the name of John Bain, had experienced runs and been forced to suspend operations in the week leading up to the RFC rescue of Central Republic, bank runs now quickly came to a halt. Although a few additional banks failed in subsequent months, these were mainly small banks in remote places like Idaho and Nevada. News of their failure was unsettling, but they were too small to be systemically significant. As in Knoxville and New York in 1930, the official response, this time by the RFC rather than the Fed, prevented the crisis from spreading further. Hoover, with an election approaching, was willing to act. With the swift intervention of the RFC, any reluctance on the part of the Chicago Fed was, for the moment, a nonissue.

But the rescue also ignited criticism of bailouts of fat-cat bankers with political connections. Treasury Secretary Mills, Chase National Bank’s Winthrop Aldrich, and Michigan Senator Couzens, who chaired the Senate committee overseeing the RFC, all questioned whether the corporation had overstepped its bounds, and the bounds of prudence, by bailing out an insolvent institution. To address complaints that the RFC was giving the well-connected preferential treatment, Congress required the RFC to inform it, starting in August 1932, of the identity of all banks receiving loans, information that was made public. As a result, the banks grew reluctant to apply for RFC assistance for fear that this information would be seen as a sign of weakness.25 Starting in September, borrowing from the RFC fell off. In October industrial production headed back down.

Government officials accused of cronyism began looking for an opportunity to repair their reputations. They needed to show that they were capable of playing hardball with a troubled bank. In 2008, in the wake of Bear Stearns, they found that opportunity with Lehman Brothers. In the wake of Central Republic, they found it with the Guardian Group of banks. Following the Democratic convention, the news flow was dominated by the contest between Hoover and Roosevelt. As the events of 2008 remind us, crises often occur around elections, when policy uncertainty is highest.

FDR’s intentions were obscure; nothing he said in the course of the campaign indicated whether he would abandon the gold standard. But Roosevelt’s activist bent and desire to break with Hoover were no secret. With his victory in November and through the four-month interregnum that followed, investors worried that the end of the gold standard was drawing near. The president-elect held meetings with gold-standard skeptics like Professor George Warren of Cornell University. Leading financiers, including Traylor of the First National Bank of Chicago, Chairman Aldrich of Chase National Bank, and Arthur Ballantine, the outgoing US Treasury undersecretary, urged him not to tamper with the monetary standard. But FDR refused to be drawn. In effect, the president-elect was offering investors a one-way bet. If they sold dollars for gold and the United States did devalue the dollar, their gold would rise in value. If instead the new president adhered to gold-standard orthodoxy, they could repurchase dollars subsequently and lose nothing. This was the same one-way bet taken by investors who questioned the commitment of the Bank of England to defend gold convertibility in 1931.

It now produced the same result. Gold drained out of the Federal Reserve System and out of the country. Whether the central bank, increasingly short of gold, would have the capacity to help in the event of further financial problems was unclear.

The answer came from the banking panic that erupted in Michigan in mid-February, two weeks before FDR took office. At the center of the crisis was the Guardian Group of banks, in one of which, Union Guardian Trust Company, Henry Ford via his son Edsel was the largest investor. In the same way Central Republic was known as the Dawes Bank, the Guardian Group of banks was known as the Ford Group. The Guardian Group had engaged in a range of dubious practices, including building for itself an ornate headquarters of gilded bricks and lending to its officers so they could speculate in stocks. It had made extensive home mortgage loans, and with the auto industry deeply depressed, many of its loans to unemployed autoworkers were in default. This, clearly, was not a bank that could survive much longer, absent the injection of financial resources by either its owners or the government.

On Wednesday, February 8, Edsel Ford briefed Treasury Secretary Mills and RFC President Charles Miller, Dawes’ successor, and on the ninth representatives of the Guardian Group traveled to Capitol Hill to brief Michigan’s two senators, James Couzens and Arthur Vandenberg. That evening the pair attended a White House meeting together with Mills, Deputy Secretary Ballantine, Commerce Secretary Roy Chapin, and the RFC’s Miller.

Michigan’s spokesmen made the case for government intervention in no uncertain terms. Within forty-eight hours Ballantine and Chapin had arrived in Detroit with the goal of organizing a loan. Ballantine was an official of the outgoing Hoover administration, but he also had long acquaintance with the incoming president. As an undergraduate he had edited the Harvard Crimson when Roosevelt was a staffer. Nor was Ballantine exactly an outsider. An attorney, he represented the Dodge Brothers when their company was acquired by Chrysler, one of Ford’s principal rivals. Chapin was a Michigander and, like Ford, a onetime auto executive, having served as chairman of the Hudson Motor Car Company, a forerunner of the American Motors Corporation. Perhaps not incidentally, he had been a founding director of the Guardian Trust Company. It was a little like having a former Goldman Sachs CEO in his position as Treasury secretary help arrange the conversion of Goldman Sachs into a bank holding company in September 2008.

Ford’s Union Guardian was as systemically significant as Charles Dawes’ Central Republic Trust, which the RFC had bailed out in June. But given criticism of that earlier action, Ballantine and Chapin now demanded that Ford inject $4 million of capital into Union Guardian as security for a loan, and asked in addition that Ford commit not to withdraw the Ford Motor Company’s $7.5 million of deposits in the bank. The RFC could offer help only to a solvent bank, the two officials explained. Ford’s $4 million capital injection and commitment of deposits were needed for Union Guardian to qualify.26 The line between solvency and insolvency might be sketchy, but with the firestorm whipped up by the RFC’s rescue of Central Republic, there was now intense pressure to draw it.

Ford refused to cooperate. He knew the RFC had supported Central Republic and did not believe it was prepared to let Guardian go under. He understood that the RFC had not exactly stood on principle the previous summer. He believed the Hoover administration would regard the collapse of Michigan’s banks as a devastating blow to a staggering economy. He upped the ante by threatening to withdraw $25 million of Ford Motor Company funds on deposit with a second local bank, the First National Bank of Detroit, another one that had already suffered heavy withdrawals.27 His, he evidently believed, was a clear case of too big to fail.

Ballantine and Chapin were aware that dire consequences might follow from allowing Guardian to go under. But they were also aware that Congress was furious about what it perceived as RFC favoritism toward big business, which Ford symbolized even more than Dawes. That Michigan Senator Couzens, Ford’s former business partner and rival, was among the critics—and that Couzens chaired the Senate committee responsible for the RFC—did not make their job any easier. Couzens was sure to make an issue of any concession, and specifically of any loan that did not require Ford to subordinate his deposits.28

So too was Father Charles Coughlin, the controversial Roman Catholic priest and inspirational radio broadcaster. Coughlin blamed business for the ills of the American economy and the Depression in particular. Located as he was in nearby Royal Oak, Michigan, he saw no better symbol of business than Henry Ford. Earlier, Coughlin had criticized Ford, who contracted to build tractors in the Soviet Union, of fostering communism and exporting American jobs. Now, using his nationwide radio network, he accused Ford and his bankers of having fomented the crisis to secure a taxpayer bailout.

Although the RFC had previously helped the Guardian Group—its first loans to subsidiaries of Guardian dated to May 1932—with Ford’s refusal to commit his deposits it declined to do more. Hoover argued that allowing Guardian to fail would be a disaster. Jesse Jones introduced a motion to give Guardian a loan but was voted down by the RFC board. Just as the US Treasury allowed Lehman Brothers to fail in September 2008 in part to make a political statement and correct the moral hazard created by its earlier bailout of Bear Stearns, the RFC allowed Guardian Trust to go under.29

Failure to prop up Union Guardian led to panicked runs on Monday, February 13. At 1:32 a.m. the next morning Michigan Governor William Comstock, in office for only weeks, declared a statewide bank holiday. The auto companies suspended all advertising, and the Ford Company laid off half its employees. Reflecting the extent to which America’s industrial center of gravity had shifted to the Midwest and to the auto industry center of Detroit specifically, the crisis quickly spilled over. Michigan companies, their local accounts frozen, scrambled to draw on their deposits in neighboring states. The Michigan holiday thus precipitated runs on banks in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois. Maryland declared a bank holiday on February 25, five more states on March 1, six on March 2, and five on March 3. Foreigners, seeing this chaos, rushed to cash in their dollars. Gold hemorrhaged out of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

On March 3 the Federal Reserve Bank of New York asked the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, still with excess gold, to purchase or rediscount $400 million of its securities. Again Chicago refused. Better, the directors of the Chicago bank evidently concluded, to save those resources for an even rainier day.

This was a disaster of miscalculation and obduracy all around. By February 1933 industrial production in the United States had fallen to just 53 percent of its 1929 level. Prices had collapsed. Unemployment was approaching 25 percent. The banking system was allowed to disintegrate over the misplaced priority attached to moral hazard. Among the consequences were the disgrace of a sitting president and the inauguration, on March 4, of a charismatic if yet unproven successor.

The only question was whether the new captain could right the sinking ship. This, of course, was the same question asked of Barack Obama following his inauguration in January 2009.
