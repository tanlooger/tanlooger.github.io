title: Chapter 13 The Spiral

It was hard to imagine that things could get worse. But worsen they did with AIG.

The AIG story is one of the more extraordinary chapters in this extraordinary tale. The company, originally known as American Asiatic Underwriters, was founded in 1919 by Cornelius Vander Starr, Northern California native, ice cream salesman, and clandestine operative for the US government. Starr’s introduction to Asia came via a job with the Pacific Mail Steamship Company. Developing a taste for the region, he became, at the age of twenty-seven, the first Westerner to sell insurance to the Chinese residents of Shanghai. (Shades of Clarence Hatry selling insurance to Austrian immigrants before 1914.) Starr insured Chinese shipping companies against losses to marauding pirates off what is now the Indonesian coast. He wrote fire insurance for factories in China and the Philippines.

During World War II, Wild Bill Donovan, head of the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS), then used Starr’s employees to gather intelligence on the enemy powers’ assets in the Far East. Starting in 1942, following US entry into the war, Starr took personal control of the clandestine operation. He helped Donovan use American Asiatic’s commercial property insurance records to identify promising bombing targets. Subsequently Starr set up a pair of front companies, Metropolitan Motors Overseas Incorporated and a New York edition of the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, whose employees acted as agents for the OSS.1

Following the occupation of Beijing and Shanghai by Communist forces in 1949, Starr moved his headquarters to New York. Under his successor, the driven, strong-willed Maurice (“Hank”) Greenberg, the rebranded American 分页。。。International Group grew into the largest underwriter of commercial and industrial insurance in the world. It provided travel and life insurance to households and managed the retirement plans of one in ten Americans. Where Lehman Brothers had $600 billion of debts, AIG’s obligations ran to the trillions.

But someone inside AIG apparently believed its experience in commercial and industrial insurance qualified it to sell protection against the failure of collateralized debt obligations. The company’s trading arm, AIG Financial Products, was one of the first shops to move into writing specialized insurance on CDOs in the 1990s. The insurance contracts in question, credit default swaps or CDS, had been invented at JPMorgan, with which AIG Financial Products did extensive business.2 Unlike Dr. Frankenstein, the mad scientists at JPMorgan appear to have understood that their creation could run amok, and they wrote CDOs and CDS with a modicum of restraint. Not so AIG Financial Products, which wrote insurance not just on high-grade securities but also on CDOs backed by subprime mortgages. By mid-2008, the unit had written an extraordinary $500 billion worth, enough to put its corporate parent in jeopardy.

AIG Financial Products was run by Joseph Cassano, who had previously worked at Drexel Burnham Lambert, which pioneered the junk bond business. Average annual compensation of Cassano’s four hundred employees exceeded $1 million.3 Salary and bonuses accounted for a third of the unit’s total revenues. AIG’s dominant position in markets for commercial, industrial, and life insurance gave it a high credit rating, which in turn relieved it of the obligation to hold collateral to back its CDO insurance. Other financial institutions, lacking AIG’s AAA rating and having to post more collateral as a result, had higher costs of providing CDO insurance. AIG Financial Product thus became the dominant player in this market.

In effect, Financial Products was taking a highly leveraged long position on the US housing market. How it was that the corporate parent, not to mention the regulator, looked the other way takes some explaining. Part of the explanation is that credit default swaps could be sold to AIG’s board as simply another form of insurance of the sort that the company had long been in the business of providing, although the instruments in question were in fact entirely different. Hank Greenberg, whose aversion to risk was sometimes described as “sociopathic,” might have understood the difference, but Greenberg was forced to resign in 2005 over an accounting scandal.4 Having failed at succession planning, he was followed by a series of short-lived, lessthan-impressive CEOs. Part of the explanation may also be that AIG Financial Products was a profit center, rendering the corporate parent loath to question its practices. Part of the explanation may be that Cassano was secretive—he refused to share information on his underwriting activities even with his corporate higher-ups—something that he got away with by virtue of his legendary temper and his unit’s profits.

AIG Financial Products was headquartered in London, beyond the purview of the New York State Insurance Department, which oversaw AIG’s insurance operations, and the Federal Reserve System, the ostensible steward of the American financial system. It booked trades through a French bank and sold derivatives insurance to European banks that loaded up on subprime-related products. CDS protection allowed the European banks to reduce the capital they were required to hold against their subprime-related investments. The banks could then expand their balance sheets and take on additional risk. One of Greenberg’s successors as CEO, Edward Liddy, in testimony before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets in 2009, charmingly referred to the practice as “balance sheet rental.”5

From a European perspective, AIG Financial Products looked less like an insurance company than a highly leveraged bank, which is of course precisely what it was. European officials logically moved to subject it to bank regulation. Unfortunately, they didn’t specify whose bank regulation, or where.6 The AIG unit arranged for the purchase of a savings and loan, American General Bank, thereby subjecting itself to oversight (if loose use of the word is permitted) by the Office of Thrift Supervision.

OTS was a particularly hapless agency created in 1989 in response to the S&L crisis. Thrifts made plain-vanilla mortgage loans; OTS had no particular competence in derivatives. The regulator’s responsibility was to AIG’s thrift subsidiary, so it viewed the operations of the larger company solely in that light. Visits by examiners were limited to Financial Products’ lowly branch office in Connecticut. The fact that Financial Products had enjoyed a fourfold increase in credit-related revenues in just one year, though noted in OTS’s 2006 audit, elicited nothing in the way of substantive comment, much less corrective action. If one fact epitomized the consequences of the ramshackle US regulatory system, this was it.

AIG Financial Products suffered mounting losses as the housing market tumbled. But it was not just the falling housing market; in addition, triggers in the insurance contracts sold by Financial Products required its parent to put up additional collateral if AIG’s credit was downgraded to single A. The existence of these provisions was not widely known even within the company, given the secretive manner in which Cassano ran his operation. Their presence came to light on the afternoon of Monday, September 15, following the failure of Lehman Brothers, when Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, late again to the game, downgraded AIG. There was more alarming news the next day. Reserve Primary Fund, America’s most venerable money market mutual fund, had some $785 million of Lehman Brothers paper in its portfolio, a fact proudly trumpeted in its July financial statement. The fund’s septuagenarian co-founder and manager, Bruce Bent Sr., now learned of Lehman’s bankruptcy courtesy of a headline spied at an airport newsstand while on holiday in Italy celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of meeting his wife.

Within twenty-four hours of Lehman’s bankruptcy, nearly half of Bent’s shareholders had asked to redeem their shares. These were not demands that the fund could easily meet by selling other investments, given demoralized markets. Back in 2007, recall, other troubled money funds were bailed out by their fund families or investment bank parents.7 But the $62 billion Primary Fund lacked a deep-pocketed investment-bank patron and had no obvious alternative. Bent was sufficiently alarmed to instruct his son, Bruce Bent II, to contact New York Fed President Geithner. Geithner being otherwise engaged, the junior Bent left a message.

The Bents first attempted, without success, to raise $100 million from the banks with which they booked their trades. Next they sought a buyer for their troubled fund, efforts that were similarly unavailing. The only option remaining was to halt redemptions and allow shares to go to a discount.8 Reserve Primary Fund duly announced that it was breaking the buck, reducing the value of its $1 shares to 97 cents. It announced further that it would consider additional requests for redemptions only after seven days.

Just months earlier, Bent Sr. had warned his shareholders that “Unfortunately, a number of money funds, and a number of investors that selected them, have lost sight of the purpose of a money fund and the simple rules that guide them in their foolhardy quest for a few extra basis points. The cash entrusted to a money fund is your reserve resource that you expect to be there no matter what.”9 Savers did not react well to news to the contrary and scrambled to get out. The biggest withdrawals were experienced by money market funds run by institutions like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that had interacted extensively with Lehman. Since money funds had been the main buyers of asset-backed commercial paper from large corporations, the last signs of life now flickered out of the commercial paper market.

Defenders of the mutual fund industry argued later that this was an overreaction. Lehman Brothers paper accounted for only 1 percent of the Reserve Primary Fund’s investment portfolio. Shareholders in the fund ultimately recovered more than 99 percent of their investments. But those same shareholders suspected that Primary Fund was not the only money fund with exposure to Lehman and, more important, that Lehman might not be one of a kind. The plight of Primary Fund reminded them that money market funds held no capital and were uninsured. Later it emerged that nearly thirty other money market mutual funds suffered losses large enough to force them to similarly break the buck but avoided doing so because they were again bailed out by their corporate parents, a luxury that Reserve Primary Fund did not enjoy.10

Money market funds developed in the early 1970s as an alternative to bank accounts, interest rates on which were limited by the Regulation Q ceilings adopted in 1933.11 With the elimination of Regulation Q in the mid-1980s, they then lost their raison d’être. But that didn’t mean they faded quietly into the night. The failure of the Securities and Exchange Commission to require them to hold banklike capital buffers was an implicit subsidy that had allowed them to outlive their usefulness, with disastrous consequences. This, the third week of September, was when the crisis reached its most dangerous point. Runs by individual investors on money market funds and by institutional investors on their investment-bank parents engulfed the shadow banking system. Consumed by fears of counterparty risk, the banks refused to lend. Even the most reputable companies, like General Electric, were unable to borrow.

Desperate circumstances prompting desperate measures, Treasury announced that it was temporarily guaranteeing the liabilities of the money funds. Guarantees are well and good, but to be credible they have to be backed. To this end Paulson authorized use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, another legacy of the Great Depression. The ESF was created in 1934, following US departure from the gold standard, with the goal of stabilizing the dollar. Now this $50 billion pot of money was used to reassure investors in money market funds that there would be no more buck breaking—that if their money market fund was unable to give them a hundred cents on the dollar, the ESF would.12

The guarantee was a prominent statement, but the fact of the matter was that $50 billion was only a drop in the bucket compared to the $3 trillion of outstanding money market shares. Again, the Fed was the only institution with sufficiently deep pockets to address the problem. But the central bank lacked the authority, even under unusual and exigent circumstances, to purchase asset-backed commercial paper directly from money market funds and provide them with cash in return. The way around this problem was the convoluted and convolutedly named Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or AMLF. Through the AMLF, the Fed lent money to State Street and JPMorgan, two of the custodians with whom the money funds held their investments and booked their trades. In turn, State Street and JPMorgan purchased commercial paper from the mutual funds, providing them the cash they needed to meet redemptions. In the end, the Fed financed more than $200 billion of commercial paper purchases by the two banks and a handful of smaller custodians.

Stabilizing money market shares and raising the limit on deposit insurance from $100,000 to $250,000, as the FDIC did subsequently, were popular steps, since they addressed the concerns of small savers. Other measures benefiting large financial institutions were more controversial. The controversy extended to the AMLF, which circumvented statutory limits on the Fed’s ability to intervene in securities markets and through which State Street and JPMorgan, it eventually emerged, earned healthy profits.13

An immediate case in point was when the Fed stepped in on Tuesday, September 16, to rescue AIG. The Fed initially balked at aiding an insurance company over which it possessed no regulatory authority. Unusual and exigent circumstances might permit it to lend to an investment bank like Bear Stearns, but lending to an insurance company was too exceptional, whatever the exigency. Federal Reserve officials indicated as much to AIG’s CEO, the former Citigroup executive Robert Willumstad, and to the company’s chief financial officer, Steven Bensinger, in a phone conversation on the morning of Saturday, September 13. New York Fed President Geithner and Treasury Secretary Paulson told Willumstad in no uncertain terms that there would be no government assistance or guarantee for AIG. Echoing the language used by Bank of England officials in their discussions with Northern Rock, they urged the company to find a private-sector solution.14

This was a misreading all around, again echoing the case of Northern Rock. The officials in question overestimated the ease of arranging a privatesector solution, while Willumstad et al. underestimated the cost. AIG first attempted to raise additional capital by selling some of its insurance units to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway and then by selling preferred shares to the private equity shop J. C. Flowers & Co. But Buffett was not interested, and AIG rejected Flowers’ price as too high. A few days later Buffett would instead invest $5 billion in Goldman Sachs. Ultimately AIG management would pay an even higher price for assistance.

Fed officials then sought to enlist Goldman Sachs, AIG’s principal derivatives trading partner, and JPMorgan Chase, the central bank’s now customary private-sector consort, in organizing a line of credit. The banks would issue a bridge loan until AIG was able to sell its insurance units, raising the cash needed to meet commitments. Officials invoked the precedent of LongTerm Capital Management, whose counterparties had collectively provided the liquidity needed to finance that troubled fund’s collateral calls.15 But the liquidity problem in 1998 was LTCM-specific; other financial institutions were flush with funds. Now everyone was potentially short of liquidity, and every bank was happy for other banks to furnish AIG with emergency assistance so long as it could husband its own liquid resources. The banks would have been better off had they acted collectively. But collective action is difficult under duress; it is even more difficult under time pressure. Efforts to assemble a bank syndicate to aid AIG went nowhere.

But if AIG was allowed to collapse, it might bring down the big counterparties, including even Goldman Sachs. Suppressing all qualms—and contradicting denials made to bankers and the insurer in previous days—the Fed, with the support of the Treasury, again declared unusual and exigent circumstances. It provided an $85 billion capital infusion packaged as a Federal Reserve Bank of New York credit line, obtaining 79.9 percent ownership in return.16 Following the precedent of Bear Stearns, the loan was extended through a pair of special purpose vehicles, Maiden Lane II and III. The capital injection stripped AIG’s shareholders of fourth-fifths of their stake. It was contingent on the immediate resignation of Willumstad.

Even though the terms were tough, they were not popular.17 If Lehman could fail, congressional critics asked, why was it imperative that AIG be saved? To Treasury and Fed officials, the answer was clear. Lehman’s failure had caused major disruptions in financial markets, and AIG’s balance sheet was many times larger. Because AIG also had retail business—it insured households and firms—failure would be even more destructive of confidence. Helping AIG was uncomfortable, but the alternative of uncontrolled bankruptcy would have been worse.18 Still, the Fed and Treasury did not cover themselves with glory, having insisted in preceding days that they would not bail out the company under any circumstances. There was more consternation on Sunday, September 21, when, short-circuiting its usual procedures, the Federal Reserve announced that it was authorizing Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the only two investment banks still standing, to convert themselves into bank holding companies. As holding companies, Goldman and Morgan Stanley would be able to borrow from the central bank on a permanent basis. As a quid pro quo, the two banks were required to raise additional capital. Still, that the step was taken without the conventional review prompted complaints of the big boys again being accorded special privileges. It was another indication that the crisis was still far from contained. Paulson and Bernanke made clear by their body language that they were uncomfortable with all this improvisation. Tapping the Exchange Equalization Fund, setting up Maiden Lane II and III, financing State Street and JPMorgan Chase’s purchases of asset-backed commercial paper, and allowing Goldman and Morgan Stanley to become bank holding companies overnight were extraordinary steps, taken with the acquiescence of the White House but without congressional authorization. The election was barely a month away, and the Republican candidate for president, Arizona Senator John McCain, was making critical noises about these unprecedented interventions.

There was fear, moreover, that AIG was only the tip of the iceberg. If the crisis spread to Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs, interventions on an even greater scale might be required. With a massive balance sheet and the ability to conjure money out of thin air, the Fed had the capacity to take their toxic assets off the banks’ hands. But Bernanke lacked the political cover. And Paulson lacked the authority.

On Friday, September 19, at the end of an historic week, a sleep-deprived Paulson, together with Bernanke and SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, joined President Bush in the Rose Garden. The president announced he was requesting additional powers for Treasury to stabilize the financial system. Just how those powers would be deployed was vague. They would be used, the officials explained, to purchase mortgage-backed securities from financial institutions, but no details were provided. The press described the requested authority as “sweeping” and “expansive.”

The emphasis on asset purchases reflected Paulson’s belief that the problem was one of liquidity. The United States was experiencing a liquidity crisis centered on mortgage-backed securities, which had spilled over into the market in asset-backed commercial paper and now threatened the banks. Having Treasury buy up those securities at reasonable prices, it followed, would restore liquidity to the markets. The banks would be able to price their assets. They would again become willing to buy and sell, and importantly to lend. The financial system, its pipes unclogged, would begin functioning again.

Elsewhere, there were doubts. It was not obvious why Treasury’s operatives would have a better idea than did market participants of what constituted a fair price for the banks’ toxic securities. Offer too little and the banks would not sell. Offer too much and they would reap a massive windfall at taxpayers’ expense.

There were suspicions, moreover, that the problem was not just one of liquidity. The banks had taken big losses on their subprime-related investments and thus needed to raise capital to resume normal operations. Without capital, they had no buffer against losses. And without a buffer against losses, they would refuse to lend.

But raising capital under stressed financial conditions was not easy. There was the alternative of government money, but Paulson, like many Republicans, opposed using taxpayer funds to inject capital, a step that he referred to, poisonously, as nationalizing the banks.19 Overpaying for toxic assets was a way of recapitalizing the banks by stealth. But this investment of public money would not come with control rights, something the government had insisted on in the case of AIG. And surreptitious recapitalization lacked legitimacy. It threatened to provoke an even bigger political reaction.

Nor were the skeptics convinced by Treasury’s three-page proposal requesting authorization to spend up to $700 billion purchasing mortgage-backed securities. What was in reality only a starting point for discussion was ineptly packaged as draft legislation. Nothing was said about taxpayer protections or congressional oversight. When declaring unusual and exigent circumstances, Chairman Bernanke at least was required to obtain the assent of four other members of the board of governors.20 Under Treasury’s proposal, the secretary would enjoy virtually unchecked powers.

The Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP as the plan immediately became known, was wounded on arrival. Within days, reluctance to grant sweeping new powers to the Treasury secretary coalesced with Republican opposition to all further government intervention. On September 29, the bill authorizing Treasury to spend $700 billion on asset purchases was defeated in the House by 228 to 205. That two-thirds of Republicans opposed the bill was embarrassing for the administration and for Paulson especially. The Dow fell by 778 points, or 7 percent, on the news.

But if Congress could speak, then so could the public. In 1929, only 8 percent of Americans had owned traded securities. Now ownership of common equity was ubiquitous, thanks to the creation in 1978 of 401(k) retirement accounts. Unhappy account holders, seeing their retirement nest eggs shatter, lit up congressional switchboards, which quickly got their representatives’ attention. On Friday, October 3, on its second try, the House passed the TARP by a vote of 263 to 171. The Senate having already acted, President Bush quickly signed the bill into law.

Congress, still wary about the open-ended powers granted the Treasury, agreed however to release only the first half of the funds. Thus it was unclear whether Treasury would have the resources to repair the financial system. Equally unclear was whether it possessed a coherent strategy for using them. On the Friday the TARP was voted, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by more than 800 points before recovering the majority of its losses. On Monday, October 6, it then fell by a further 370 points, or nearly 4 percent. This was not a vote of confidence.

Inevitably, the task of triage fell to the Fed. On Tuesday, October 7, it announced an increase in the size of the Term Auction Facility and that it would lend an additional $300 billion to banks with end-of-year cash needs. The next day it announced a more radical step, the creation of a Commercial Paper Funding Facility to lend directly to corporations and nonbank financial institutions. In his most influential research on the Great Depression, Bernanke had in 1983 detailed how the collapse of the commercial paper market on which corporations issue short-term debt disrupted the flow of credit to the corporate sector in the 1930s. The Commercial Paper Funding Facility was designed to prevent a replay of this history. The mechanism was another special purpose vehicle, à la Maiden Lane I, II, and III. Once again, the lessons of the Depression, as distilled by historical scholars, informed the response of policy makers (in this case the two actors being one and the same). As for whether that response would be enough to avert another depression, time would tell.
