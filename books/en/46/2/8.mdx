title: Chapter 8 The Next Leg Down
---



The contraction accelerated following the crash. Petroleum, pig iron, and steel production all fell in the fourth quarter of 1929. Motor vehicle production declined further. Industrial production fell by 9 percent between early October and the end of the year—that is to say, at a 30 percent annual rate.1 In 2008, by comparison, US industrial production fell only two-thirds as fast in the three months following the failure of Lehman Brothers.

As bad as things were, this was still no Great Depression. Much as when the Subprime Crisis erupted in 2007, the worst was limited to the United States, and it was still possible to argue that the worst would soon be over. The decline in foreign stock markets was limited. Other countries, not hit by the same massive shock to confidence, saw little fall in industrial production in the fourth quarter of 1929. Canada, though closely tied to the United States, saw no decline in industrial production until December. In France, where stabilization and then recovery had begun late, the economy continued to expand.

Latin America and other regions that relied on commodity exports felt the fallout from the US slowdown most strongly. US firms cut back on purchases of coffee, cocoa, rubber, and silk. With consumer and industrial demand weakening, they saw less need for supplies. Financial problems made it more difficult to obtain trade credit.2 Whatever the reason, the result was that the United States imported less.

But commodity production follows its own rhythm, with planting and harvest decisions occurring far in advance. The fall now was in prices, not production. Coffee prices fell by 30 percent in the fourth quarter of 1929, corn prices by 15 percent.3 Commodity prices had already been weak for the better part of a decade, but this now was “an acute attack, supervening 分页。。。upon a chronic form of the same disease.”4 As yet it did not precipitate widespread debt defaults by Latin American countries that had borrowed extensively in the 1920s and now had heavy debts to service. But these would come.

In the final months of 1929 it was still possible to argue that damage from the Crash would be limited—in the language favored by officials in 2007, that the consequences would be “contained.” The Fed had prevented the market’s sharp correction from infecting the banking system; at least it had prevented serious bank failures. A number of small banks failed in the wake of the stock market crash, to be sure, but then small banks failed all through the 1920s.

By early 1930, however, evidence that the economy was weakening was unmistakable. The 1929 Christmas shopping season was disappointing, and department store sales continued to fall at a 10 percent annual rate in the first half of 1930. There was no question that this was now a recession.

Central banks responded accordingly. The Open Market Investment Committee authorized the New York Fed to reduce its discount rate in half-point increments in February and March.5 The Bank of England and German Reichsbank cut their interest rates in sympathy. Even the Bank of France, which maintained immensely large reserves and rarely adjusted policy, cut its discount rate by half a point at the end of January, in the first such change in two years.

Initially, financial markets responded favorably. Share prices in New York rose by 16 percent in the first four months of 1930. More than $100 million of foreign government bonds were floated in the United States between January and March. This was just a fraction of 1927–28 levels, but it was still higher than in any quarter of 1929. In the United States, Canada, and the principal European countries, industrial production held steady through the first three months of 1930.

But even if firms were maintaining production, prices were continuing to fall, signaling that demand was not keeping up. By May it was clear that unemployment was weighing on spending in the United States, Britain, and Germany. Demand for the products of French industry was “poor.” Economic conditions in Belgium were “unsatisfactory.” Japanese business was “inactive.”6

At this point, the drop in industrial production accelerated dramatically. In the United States, the fall from December 1929 to December 1930 was 21 percent. In Germany it was 23 percent.7 Conditions in other countries were not much better. This, clearly, was the turning point where a garden-variety recession became something more. Charles Kindleberger, in his classic account, considers four explanations for the break: inadequate US monetary support, trade restrictions, weak commodity prices, and events abroad.8 It is worth considering them in turn.

On the monetary front, it is again not accurate to say that the Federal Reserve did nothing. Twice, in May and June 1930, the board of governors approved further cuts in the discount rate of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By midyear, the rate charged by the New York bank had fallen to less than half the 6 percent level of the previous August. This was at least a step in the right direction. But at this point the board concluded that its work was done. Since the cost of credit was low, its members agreed, credit availability did not now pose an obstacle to stabilization and recovery.

The reality, of course, was that the cost of credit was not so low. Although interest rates had declined, prices were also falling, raising the cost of repayment (what economists refer to as the real interest rate). By June, wholesale prices were fully 7 percent below the late-1929 level.9

Perhaps the fall in prices was not yet widely anticipated; if so, it could not have created a hesitancy to borrow. Commodity futures prices, one indicator of expected future price levels, were above actual prices in the first half of 1930, consistent with the notion that the fall in prices was not fully anticipated. But even though futures remained above actual prices, they were also falling. James Hamilton has analyzed the link between commodity futures prices and the overall price level, concluding that market participants expected prices to fall in the first and second trimesters of 1930, albeit by somewhat less than turned out to be the case.10

And although yields on threeto six-month treasury notes and certificates had come down to less than 2 percent by midyear, the long-term rates relevant to fixed-investment decisions remained stubbornly high.11 What more might the Fed have done? To start, it could have reduced its lending rates further. With the discount rate at 2½ percent, there was more room to cut. This was true by the standards of the 1930s, given how the New York Fed had brought the discount rate down to 1 percent by the end of the decade. It was similarly true by the standards of the 2000s, given how the Bernanke Fed brought rates down to 0.25 percent in the wake of the 2008–09 crisis.

But contemporary monetary doctrine held that financial institutions should borrow from the central bank only as a last resort and that the Fed should lend only at a penalty rate. Otherwise, banks would use cheap funding for speculative investments. Firms would engage in overproduction. Or so it was believed by Federal Reserve governors who viewed the future through the lens of the past. In fact, although rash behavior had been a problem in the past, it was not obviously a problem in 1930, the bubble having so recently burst. Be that as it may, the members of the Federal Reserve Board were slow to acknowledge that circumstances had changed.

Some members of the board, Adolph Miller prominent among them, were convinced in any case that lowering rates would be pushing on a string. Miller, recall, was a believer in the real bills doctrine. Central bank credit was useful, in this view, for financing the legitimate needs of business but could do nothing to encourage it when firms were cutting back. Monetary operations could “stimulate the flow of money into use” when business was picking up, but they would do little to encourage borrowing and activity when firms were retrenching.12 Under these circumstances, there was no alternative to relying on the self-equilibrating tendencies of the market. Stabilization of business conditions would have to come about through “reduced production, reduced inventories, the gradual reduction of consumer credit, the liquidation of security loans, and the accumulation of savings through the exercise of thrift,” in the words of George Norris, the former director of the Department of Wharves, Docks, and Ferries of the City of Philadelphia, who now served as governor of that city’s Federal Reserve bank.

The Open Market Investment Committee authorized a modest $50 million of securities purchases in March 1930 but then signaled its reluctance to do more.13 In June the executive committee of the Open Market Policy Conference (the new name of the recently reorganized Open Market Investment Committee) permitted the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to purchase an additional $25 million of treasury securities for two weeks. But that decision was taken mainly for technical reasons, and even then the vote was closely split, indicating that further authorizations were unlikely. After two weeks Harrison proposed extending the program, but the executive committee rejected the request by four to one (Harrison himself providing the dissenting vote). Harrison could have insisted on a more ambitious program; he could have threatened to undertake the purchases for the New York bank’s own account, as before. Benjamin Strong would have been bolder, the implication follows. We will never know. The other headline economic event of 1930, the textbooks tell us, was the Smoot-Hawley tariff act. The tariff, those textbooks tell us, had a sharp negative impact on the economy. Unfortunately, the textbooks are wrong.

The tariff was an issue in the 1928 presidential campaign. The Republicans were the party of protectionism, and Hoover courted the Midwest farm vote with promises to tax commodity imports. The House Ways and Means Committee opened its hearings on January 7, 1929, two months and a day after the election. The committee was chaired by Willis Hawley, a long-serving representative from Oregon. Hawley had worked his way up from farm boy to private school principal, professor of history and economics, and president of Willamette College before entering politics; his sponsorship of the tariff was less successful. After serving in Congress for thirteen terms, he would fail to secure the nomination of his own party in 1932.14 Reed Smoot, after having served five terms in the Senate, similarly was defeated by Democrat Elbert Thomas in his 1932 campaign for reelection.

The tariff legislation that came to be forever associated with Smoot and Hawley took nearly a year and a half to wend its way through the Congress. On June 17, 1930, it was signed into law by President Hoover, ceremonially wielding six solid-gold pens. Smoot-Hawley raised the tariff on dutiable imports from 38 to 45 percent.15 Creating a congressional coalition had required reaching out to additional constituencies, including eastern manufacturing. The tariff schedule that resulted was a hodgepodge that gave even more generous protection to industry than agriculture.

The question is to what effect. Raising the prices of dutiable imports diverted some spending toward their American-produced substitutes, which domestic producers welcomed under the circumstances. Working in the other direction was the fact that a higher tariff also meant less purchasing power for consumers. But this effect was small, since imports were only 5 percent of US gross national product in 1929 and two-thirds of imports were subject to no duty at all. Putting this all together, Douglas Irwin calculates that Smoot-Hawley reduced US incomes by at most $116 million, or 0.1 percent of 1929 US GDP. This was small potatoes by the standards of the Great Depression.16

The tariff has also been blamed for creating uncertainty that discouraged investment. This is not unlike the argument that the Obama stimulus and health care reform in 2009 created uncertainty that discouraged business investment. Robert Edgerton, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, complained in November 1929 that industry and commerce were “in many instances unable to conclude their plans and many programs of development are waiting or threatened with abandonment, while party politics, bloc politics, personal politics, and sectional politics are maneuvering for this or that advantage or to avenge this or that default or embarrassing this or that political personality.”17

But even if true, the uncertainty of which Edgerton warned was resolved by mid-1930. Robert Archibald and David Feldman analyzed the uncertainty hypothesis by relating investment in fifteen industries to their exposure to foreign trade.18 Their findings suggest that investment was, in fact, weaker than expected in 1929, when the outcome of congressional deliberations was least clear. But there was no analogous evidence for 1930, in whose first half the outlines of the legislation were being clarified and by the middle of which uncertainty about the tariff had been resolved. Again, the conclusion must be that any negative effects were small and transient.

And if Smoot-Hawley did not have a large impact on the US economy, then it could not have had a large impact on the rest of the world. This is not to deny the existence of negative impacts on particular producers. Italy objected to higher tariffs on its exports of straw hats and olive oil. Swiss watchmakers were up in arms. Spanish exporters of grapes, oranges, and onions were hit by the American measure. Across Latin America, exporters complained of the protection afforded the American farmer. There and elsewhere, the tariff reinforced the problem of weak commodity prices. Smoot-Hawley thus made it harder for commodity producers to earn dollars, in turn making it harder to service their debt.

The question is how much harder. Kevin Carey has looked for this effect in the reaction of the prices of government bonds in June 1930, the month the tariff bill was signed.19 If the tariff in fact created major problems for commodity exporters, raising the likelihood that they would be forced to default on their debts, then the prices of their bonds should have fallen. Although there is some evidence of this, the effect is again small.

Where Smoot-Hawley mattered was in undermining international comity. It elicited protests from thirty foreign governments. It “intensified nationalism all over the world,” in the words of Morgan partner Thomas Lamont.20 It provoked retaliation and led to the collapse of a conference convened by the League of Nations with the goal of negotiating a coordinated reduction in tariffs. The Depression was a global phenomenon, and containing it required a global response. Any effort to coordinate a response, whether in the form of synchronized interest rate reductions, a debt moratorium, or an emergency loan, was that much harder when governments were at one another’s throat over Smoot-Hawley.

Thus, the textbook assertion that Smoot-Hawley worsened the Depression in the United States is bad history in the service of good policy. Although there is no evidence that the tariff had a significant negative impact on the American economy, its ritual invocation helped policy makers resist the protectionist temptation in 2009. That in turn made it easier to mount an internationally coordinated response. Herbert Hoover is a controversial figure in any account of the Depression. He entered the period riding the triumph of his victorious 1928 campaign, admired equally for his personal traits, which included honesty, industriousness, and self-reliance, and his accomplishments, having come from modest background, working his way through Stanford University, using his skills as a mining engineer and entrepreneur to become independently wealthy, and making his name as a humanitarian by heading the Committee for Relief of Belgium and then the U.S. Food Administration during World War I. Prior to his election as president, he was a highly successful commerce secretary.

Four years later he was a defeated man—or, more accurately, a defeated presidential candidate and bitter man. He was bitter over being blamed for a Depression whose roots had taken hold on his predecessor Calvin Coolidge’s watch, and which Hoover himself blamed on others, like Benjamin Strong. He was disappointed by his own failure to meet the challenge of the crisis. That failure reflected a mismatch between the president’s worldview on the one hand and what was required in the extraordinary circumstances of the 1930s on the other. Hoover was a steadfast believer in monetary and fiscal orthodoxy in a period when the challenges for economic policy were anything but orthodox. He had a Quaker’s faith in self-help, associationalism, and a limited role of the state but was confronted by a crisis whose very nature underscored the limits of self-help and need for government intervention. Far from an inspirational leader, he was aloof and sensitive to criticism—the temperamental opposite of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

Hoover’s strategy for bolstering confidence was to preserve the prevailing level of wages. As the New York Times summarized the president’s arguments, maintaining prevailing wage rates would ensure labor peace. Doing so was desirable on humanitarian grounds. And avoiding wage cuts would preserve “the consuming power of the country.”21 Hoover convened a series of meetings with prominent businessmen, including Henry Ford and Owen D. Young, the latter in his capacity as president and chairman of General Electric. Labor leaders agreed to avoid calling strikes and agitating for wage increases as a quid pro quo.

During World War I, when the imperative was to keep production going at all cost, President Wilson had resorted to this kind of proto-corporatist compact. Wilson pressed employers to offer high wages in return for unions promising labor peace. Hoover, recall, had worked as head of Wilson’s Food Administration, when his was a voice for sacrifice and cooperation. He now instinctively reached for a Wilsonian response to the crisis.

But the kind of corporatist compact that was appropriate during World War I was less obviously appropriate in the current downturn. The threat of strikes and walkouts was less, given weak economic conditions. In any case, the policy’s impact on spending was uncertain. Although laborers spared wage cuts would spend more, firms forced to pay higher wages saw their profits squeezed, causing them to prune costs by laying off workers and reducing hours. The policy was important for preventing demand from falling faster. At the same time, however, it inhibited the necessary adjustment of costs and discouraged supply. Given how supplyand demand-side effects pulled in opposite directions, the overall effect was limited. With policy doing little to attenuate it, the slump in industrial production continued to deepen. The liabilities of failed nonfinancial businesses reached a record $84 million in December 1930. Other businesses that avoided failure similarly found it difficult to repay what they borrowed. Small rural banks had failed throughout the 1920s. Now in 1930 came a drought in which fifteen states from the Mid-Atlantic to the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys received only 57 percent of normal rainfall.22 Agricultural incomes fell by half. The deposits of failed banks rose from an earlier level of $20 million a month to $180 million in November and $370 million in December.

This was the first of several instances when the Fed failed to stave off financial crisis. At least that is how the episode is characterized by Friedman and Schwartz. Other analysts, in contrast, dismiss the events of late 1930 as not rising to the level of a crisis. They point to the fact that fully half of the deposits of failed banks stemmed from just two cases: the Bank of United States and a chain of Southern banks controlled by Caldwell and Company.23

Rogers Caldwell was the flamboyant son of a staid Nashville banker. (As will become evident, there is a pattern here.) The younger Caldwell dropped out of Vanderbilt University in 1910 to run his father’s insurance business. That Clarence Hatry similarly started out running his parents’ business in the same year and similarly graduated to insurance is presumably a coincidence. So is the fact that both men acquired racing stables, though this says something about the personality type.

From selling general insurance, Caldwell moved into selling surety bonds for construction projects. Surety bonds were guarantees of repayment, not unlike today’s credit default swaps. From there Caldwell graduated to underwriting the bonds themselves. As in Hatry’s case, these tended to be the bonds of municipalities and local government agencies with which the underwriter had developed personal and political connections. Caldwell specialized in the bonds of drainage districts that dug ditches and built levies, that borrowed to finance the work, and that serviced their bonds with taxes. By the late 1920s Caldwell was also underwriting single property bonds to finance hotels, hospitals, and office buildings. Most of these predictably lapsed into default when the commercial real estate boom collapsed in 1929.

In 1919, four years after Hatry acquired the Commercial Bank, Caldwell launched the Bank of Tennessee, which he used to warehouse funds raised by his bond sales. Rather than immediately passing them on to the drainage district or hotelier doing the borrowing, he put them to personal use.24 Caldwell acquired insurance companies, textile mills, an asphalt supply company, dairies, laundries, a chain of department stores, and a minor-league baseball team, a diverse collection of businesses even by Hatry’s standards. In some cases the businesses he acquired were the same ones with which he had contracted to underwrite bond issues. It was easier to secure a steady stream of underwriting business, evidently, if the underwriter also owned the company doing the borrowing. Owning insurance companies had the further advantage that if it turned out to be difficult to sell a bond to other investors, then it could be sold in a related-party transaction to the captive insurer. Also valuable in this stable of companies was Kentucky Rock and Concrete, which supplied asphalt for highway construction projects, often the same ones financed by Caldwell’s underwriting business.

At the center of this business group was a chain of banks. A set of separately chartered banks are said to constitute a chain when they are controlled by the same ownership group (recall how chain banking was also the basis for the Manley-Anthony group of banks that failed in 1926 when the Florida land bubble burst).25 The advantage of chain banking is that it permits the owner to do business in multiple states even when there are prohibitions on cross-state branching. The corresponding problem is that regulators may fail to take into account the liabilities of one bank to another. Banks in a number of states may be supervised by regulators not habituated to sharing information.

Caldwell now took advantage of the fact. His chain extended from Tennessee into Kentucky, Arkansas, and North Carolina. When in 1930 he acquired an interest in the Louisville-based BancoKentucky Company (formally the National Bank of Kentucky), his empire encompassed banks with deposits of $225 million and insurance companies with $216 million of reported assets. For a fleeting moment his conglomerate was the largest investment banking firm in the region. Caldwell built himself a lavish estate patterned after the Hermitage, the home of his hero Andrew Jackson, and furnished it with European mirrors and fireplaces. More precisely, the Bank of Tennessee built it for him: construction was paid for by $350,000 of the bank’s funds, and the home was listed as an asset on its balance sheet before being transferred on June 1, 1930, under mysterious circumstances, to Caldwell’s personal account. By this time, many of the investments of the Caldwell empire had gone bad. Caldwell and Company’s portfolio of real estate bonds was performing poorly, and its industrial investments were rendered unprofitable by the economic downturn. To stay afloat, the company increasingly relied on the revenues from bond sales on behalf of drainage districts and municipalities temporarily held on deposit at the Bank of Tennessee, and on the ability of the Caldwell banks to attract deposits from unsuspecting households, firms, and, not least, the State of Tennessee. In addition, acquiring BancoKentucky in mid-1930 allowed Caldwell to temporarily replenish the coffers by borrowing $2.4 million from the newly affiliated bank.

The event that exposed the cracks in this façade was closure of the Bank of Tennessee on November 7, 1930. State examiners had already concluded that the bank was undercapitalized and instructed it to make available an additional $4 million of securities to protect depositors. They subsequently discovered that securities of lesser value had been substituted, leading to their November action.

The timing pointed to the importance of political connections for Caldwell’s operation. November 7, 1930, was the first Friday after a Tennessee gubernatorial election in which voters returned Governor Henry Hollis Horton for a second two-year term. Horton, previously the speaker of the Tennessee Senate, had ascended to the governorship in 1927 when the preceding governor, Austin Peay, died in office. Already during Horton’s first run for a full two-year term as governor in 1928, the close connections between the Horton administration and Caldwell’s Kentucky Rock and Concrete, which received state contracts without competitive bids, had been raised as an issue. Caldwell could ascribe his good fortune to another Tennessee power broker, the newspaper publisher and property developer Colonel Luke Lea.26 Lea advised Governor Horton, and his newspapers, the Nashville Tennessean and Knoxville Journal, gave the candidate their enthusiastic endorsement. But the colonel was also a business partner of Caldwell’s; together the two men purchased a controlling interest in Holston National Bank in Knoxville. Lea, conveniently, was also a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

Now in 1930 it was alleged that Lea had used the promise of an endorsement to encourage Horton to grant Caldwell further contracts to supply asphalt for state construction projects. Whatever the merits of the accusation, it is clear that Lea and Caldwell were closely connected and that their connections led directly to the governor’s office.

Thus, the delay in closing Caldwell’s Bank of Tennessee until the Friday after the 1930 gubernatorial election was no coincidence. (To limit panic and give depositors time to gather their wits, regulators have learned to time bank closures to coincide with the weekend.) Failure of the Bank of Tennessee created understandable fears that, once the weekend was over, the Holston National Bank might follow. It was rumored that Holston National had large loans outstanding to Caldwell and Company, which it had funded by borrowing from other banks. Depositors queued up in large numbers to withdraw their balances the following Monday. Given evidence of mismanagement at the Bank of Tennessee and Holston National’s connections to Caldwell, investors had good reason to worry about the solvency of the Knoxville bank. Beyond that, it was unclear what other banks might be implicated. Better safe than sorry, so depositors scrambled to withdraw their money from other banks in Knoxville and neighboring cities. At this point, events showed every sign of degenerating into a full-blown crisis. This placed the ball squarely in the court of the Fed’s local branch, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Its officers appear to have been fully aware of a central bank’s lender-of-last-resort responsibilities. (Lea resigned his directorship on November 15, citing an inability to attend meetings.) The Atlanta Fed had long been one of the more activist branches of the Federal Reserve System.27 It had early experience with financial distress as a result of the cotton boom and bust that infected its district in the immediate aftermath of World War I. It was also responsible, through a Jacksonville, Florida, branch, for the currency circulation of Cuba, that country having adopted the US dollar following the Spanish-American War. When in April 1926 rumors of the insolvency of a Canadian bank operating on the island sparked a panic and liquidity crisis, the Atlanta Fed boatlifted forty-two pouches of currency to Havana. This allowed other banks to pay out cash to depositors, successfully stemming the run.28

Given this experience, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, like the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, understood the value of full cash drawers for confidence. Its response was thus to make arrangements to ship several million dollars of currency to Knoxville. Tuesday, November 11, being Armistice Day, the banks were closed, providing time to get the cash on the move.

When the Holston-Union failed to reopen on Wednesday, two of its Knoxville-based competitors, the East Tennessee National Bank and National City Bank, experienced panicked runs. These banks had no business connections with the Caldwell-Lea chain, but no matter. More than $1 million was withdrawn by depositors by 2:00 p.m. Fortunately, the Atlanta Fed’s “huge stacks of cash and currency” now having arrived, it was possible to pay out cash to depositors; word of this “reassured the most timid.”29 By the end of business on Thursday, most of the individuals who withdrew their money on previous days had redeposited it. A. P. Frierson, president of the Knoxville Clearing House Association (the association through which local banks cleared checks and other payments drawn on one another), was able to conclude with evident relief that “excitement on the part of the depositing public . . . has subsided.”30

This did not prevent problems in Tennessee from spreading to neighboring states and to non-Caldwell-affiliated banks. But the most prominent failures were of Caldwell-affiliated institutions. Just as ten of the Tennessee banks that failed in this period were Caldwell affiliates, the same was true of forty-five failed banks in Arkansas, fifteen in Kentucky, and fifteen in North Carolina.

Among the casualties was the American Exchange Trust Company, the largest bank in Arkansas. Not only had the American Exchange Trust invested in Caldwell & Company, but Caldwell & Company, together with its partner A. B. Banks & Co., controlled 70 percent of its shares. That a third of its loans were to the bank’s own officers and directors was a further indication that this was no normal financial institution. On November 16, responding to $4 million of panicked withdrawals, American Exchange Trust suspended payments.31 The next day the Comptroller of the Currency closed the National Bank of Kentucky.

The State of Tennessee had $5 million of highway money in the Bank of Tennessee and the Holston-Union Bank, and Caldwell had personally guaranteed the state’s deposits. The authorities therefore moved to seize his racing stable of sixty-four thoroughbreds and one stud. To the disappointment of officials, their sale netted only $85,000, a fraction of the value of the bonds Caldwell had guaranteed. The state next attempted to seize his estate, Brentwood Hall, but the title having been transferred to his name, Caldwell was able to invoke the homestead exemption.

Governor Horton did not survive the scandal. He chose not to run for a third term in 1932 and died shortly thereafter. Caldwell and Lea, together with J. Basil Ramsey, president of Holston-Union National Bank and Holston Trust Company, were indicted for using state highway funds to pay off other debts. Lea was convicted, imprisoned in 1934, and paroled in 1936. Caldwell fared better. His conviction was thrown out by the Tennessee State Supreme Court, and he was never retried. State officials did not succeed in evicting him from Brentwood Hall until 1954.

The 1930 banking crisis centered on Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina can be dismissed as the product of a handful of colorful personalities. The crisis was limited to the South and largely, though not entirely, to Caldwell’s chain. Not a few financial historians have sought to minimize the events of 1930 in this way.

But in fact, what prevented the crisis from spreading further, both to additional non-Caldwell banks in the South and beyond the region, was the rapid response of the Atlanta Fed. The limited extent of the 1930 crisis reflected not so much its idiosyncratic nature as the quick reaction of the Atlanta Reserve bank. This prevented the insolvency of a limited number of banks from exciting a panic and liquidity crisis that could have engulfed the banking system. That the events of 1930 are not always viewed as rising to the level of a banking crisis, in the true sense of the term, does not indicate an absence of serious problems capable of igniting a major crisis, but rather the ability of a powerful central bank response to prevent the worst. All this is evidence that Federal Reserve officials, at least some of them, understood how to respond to a panic. The question was whether they would do so again when they next had the opportunity. That opportunity came later in 1930 with the failure of the Bank of United States. This was not the Bank of the United States, the proto-central bank that operated from 1791 to 1836. But the name was no coincidence. Like the portrait of the Capitol that adorned the bank’s main branch, the name was designed to inspire confidence. A 1926 law prohibited banks from using the words “Federal,” “United States,” and “Reserve” in their names but was not retroactive. The Bank of United States having been founded in 1913 by Joseph Marcus, a garment manufacturer, the name was grandfathered in.

On Marcus’ death in 1928, the bank was taken over by his son Bernard, who immediately became one of the youngest bank presidents in the country. Both Marcuses, but especially the son, pursued policies of aggressive expansion. They increased the bank’s capitalization to $25 million, its branches to sixty-one, and its customers to 400,000, the most of any bank in the country. They created affiliates for underwriting and trading securities. They established an investment trust company to sell securities to depositors. Prominent among those securities, it would turn out, were shares in the bank itself.

They also lent for commercial real estate projects, including several large Manhattan apartment blocks. As many as 40 percent of the bank’s loans were property-related, compared to the average for New York City banks of just 12 percent. The Bank of United States adopted Florida-like practices, providing second and third mortgages. It lent to developers and, like Caldwell & Company, invested in single-property bonds. It created affiliated companies to purchase land and develop apartment complexes directly.

Other investors were aware that this was not an ideal time to commit to the commercial real estate market. Bank of United States stock began falling in April 1929, this despite the fact that other bank stocks were still rising and the stock market generally was booming. Operating through affiliated companies, Marcus and his executive vice president, Saul Singer, previously head of the Cloak, Suit, and Shift Manufacturers’ Protective Association, bought time by purchasing their own stock, in the same way that Clarence Hatry used borrowed funds to buy up shares in his companies. Branch managers were coached to sell shares to unsuspecting depositors.32

And what informed investors evidently knew, the regulators knew as well. In the summer of 1929, Federal Reserve and state bank examiners cited Marcus and Singer for running a “sloppy bank.”33 Risk management practices were lax, and the bank’s asset portfolio was concentrated in illiquid real estate investments. Prompt corrective action was required.

New York State Superintendent of Banking Joseph A. Broderick worked through the summer of 1929 to merge the Bank of United States with a stronger partner.34 A prospective partner was found in the private bank J. and W. Seligman, along with a suitable chairman in the person of a vice president of National City Bank, S. Sloan Colt. Negotiations appeared to reach a successful conclusion in the second half of October. But then the market’s crash put paid to the merger scheme, as it did to other well-laid plans.

Broderick next sought to interest other banks in acquiring the Bank of United States. There were hopes in early 1930 that it might be acquired by Irving Trust, but when Bank of United States stock rose on rumors of the purchase, the transaction became too expensive, given the uncertainties surrounding the Bank of United States’ portfolio of dubious real estate loans. A buyer with deeper pockets was required.

Broderick therefore turned to Manufacturers Trust Company, one of New York’s largest banks. Unfortunately, Manufacturers Trust had many of the same weaknesses as the Bank of United States, notably heavy exposure to real estate. Singer didn’t make things easier by demanding that his son, like Marcus’, be given a position at Manufacturers Trust. Discussions dragged on. That they were underway became public knowledge in October.

The announcement on Monday, December 8, 1930, that merger negotiations had broken down was the spark that ignited the run. In the next two days more than $2 million was withdrawn from the Bank of United States by twenty-five hundred panicked depositors. Customers queued for hours to empty their accounts. Mounted police were summoned to handle the crowds.

This now threatened to become the largest bank failure in US history. An emergency meeting was convened on the premises of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. It is not clear whether it took place in the same first-floor conference room used for the emergency meeting to discuss the rescue of Lehman Brothers on September 12, 2008, but the building was the same, namely the Fed’s imposing fortress at 15 Liberty Street, which dated from 1924. The all-night meeting on December 10 was attended by a familiar cast of characters: Governor Harrison, J. P. Morgan partner Thomas Lamont, Owen Young in his capacity as a director of the New York Fed, and New York State Lieutenant Governor Herbert Lehman.

Following an unsuccessful attempt to resuscitate the Manufacturers Trust merger, efforts centered on identifying another suitable marriage partner. (One can’t help but be reminded how, following the collapse of merger talks between Bank of America and Lehman Brothers, officials in their desperation sought out another partner in the form of Barclays.35) But consummating a marriage would take time, especially if the courtship had to start from scratch. In the meanwhile it would be necessary for the Clearing Banks, the association of New York banks overseeing the clearing and settlements process, to guarantee the deposits and other liabilities of the troubled institution.

At 4:00 a.m. on the morning of December 11, at the end of the all-night session, the Clearing Banks refused. It has been speculated that antipathy for the Jewish owners of the Bank of United States played a role.36 In addition, the Clearing Banks were uncertain of the magnitude of the liabilities they were asked to assume. The bank’s complicated group structure didn’t make this easy to estimate. Again, the parallel with Lehman Brothers, and the difficulty that Bank of America and Barclays had in making sense of its books, is direct.37 Conferees having failed to reach an agreement, the bank did not open on Thursday morning. The refusal of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to support the Bank of United States presumably reflected its judgment that the bank was insolvent (more shades of Lehman Brothers). But the New York Fed was aware of the risk that the crisis might spread further, perhaps to Manufacturers Trust, with its portfolio of real estate loans, and perhaps to other banks. Depositors uncertain about the condition of their bank were apt to withdraw their funds, and if their bank was unable to supply them with cash, the news might spark a panic. To prevent this from happening, the New York Fed immediately took steps to provide additional cash and liquid assets to other banks in the city, purchasing some $40 million of government securities from the banks in the next three days. In the week following, it discounted and bought an additional $100 million of bills. Its intervention prevented the insolvency of one prominent institution from sparking a panicked run and a liquidity crisis.

The Bank of United States, for its part, was taken over by the New York State Banking Department. The other members of the New York Clearinghouse Association agreed to loan depositors in the Bank of United States up to 50 percent of the value of their deposits on presentation of their pass book, with the deposit serving as collateral. They admitted Manufacturers Trust to their clearinghouse, short-circuiting normal procedures in a step that anticipated the decision to convert Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into bank holding companies over a weekend in 2008.38

Evidently, the role of the Federal Reserve at this juncture—in what we know with hindsight to have been the onset of the Great Depression—was more complex than sometimes supposed. Contrary to common assertion, officials within the Federal Reserve System understood the central bank’s responsibility as lender and liquidity provider of last resort. Just as they had flooded the markets with liquidity, lending freely against eligible collateral when the stock market crashed in 1929, they now furnished those huge stacks of cash and currency to prevent the problems of Caldwell & Company from spreading and lent freely against eligible collateral to prevent the liquidity problems caused by failure of the Bank of United States from infecting other banks. Their quick reaction explains why the Great Crash did not result in more financial dislocations and why the banking crisis of 1930 was not more severe.

But there was also good luck in that the 1930 crisis centered on Nashville, Knoxville, and New York. The New York Fed, located at the epicenter of the US financial system, and the Atlanta Fed, for reasons of geography having been designated the steward of Cuba’s financial system, understood how to respond to a crisis. It was far from clear that other Reserve banks were comparably experienced and well informed, or that their response, when the time came, would be equally adequate.

In 1930, in addition, the Reserve banks were unconstrained. They still had ample gold reserves, obviating any conflict between the obligation to maintain gold convertibility and the provision of emergency liquidity. There was plenty of high-quality commercial paper for the Federal Reserve banks to discount, since business had been in decline only for a matter of months. Things would be different in 1931 and, especially, in 1933.

Moreover, although officials in Atlanta and New York understood how to respond to such financial disturbances, they did not obviously understand the distinction between nominal and real interest rates (the latter, recall, being quoted interest rates adjusted for inflation). They did not understand that low interest rates could signal that the demand for credit, and with it the economy, was weak, not that credit was ample and that the central bank had done its job. Beholden to the real bills doctrine, they did not appreciate their responsibility for managing supplies of money and credit so as to prevent a disastrous decline in the price level, spending, and economic activity. Among the consequences of that decline in spending and activity were gold losses for the Fed, as investors began to ask questions about the prospects for the dollar, and a further decline in commercial paper eligible to be discounted at the central bank.

Thus the central bank would be in a decidedly less favorable position when financial problems returned.
