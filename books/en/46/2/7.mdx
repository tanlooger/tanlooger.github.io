title: Chapter 7 Spent Bullets
---



By the spring of 1929, the Fed’s interest rate increases, reinforced now by the policy of direct pressure, were being felt by the stock market. Brokers’ loans, though still available, were getting expensive. Billy Durant, more conscious than most of the importance of cheap credit for Wall Street, grew alarmed and took his concerns to the highest level. Durant arrived at the White House after dinner one evening in early April, by taxi rather than chauffeured limousine to avoid attracting attention. In an audience with President Hoover, he argued that “the Federal Reserve in its tightening of security loans was killing the goose that laid the golden egg.”1 Hoover, critical of the Fed’s earlier low-interest-rate policies for fueling speculation, was unmoved.

Having failed to convert the president, Durant next tried to go over the head of the White House by mobilizing public opinion. He purchased fifteen minutes of time on the CBS radio network for an address highlighted by a demand that the “autocrats” on the Federal Reserve Board keep their hands off business.2 Although the broadcast made a splash, it had no impact on Fed policy.

Unable to influence the central bank, Durant began quietly getting out of the market. The question was how many other investors would follow. Over the summer, the answer appeared to be “not many.” Between June and August the Dow Jones industrials advanced by a further 16 percent. The mania for stocks spread from Wall Street to Main Street. Coverage of the markets moved from the business section to the front page of the dailies.

On September 5, Roger Babson, goateed investment guru, amateur business cycle theorist, and prominent prohibitionist, then gave his annual address to the National Business Conference, the punch line of which was “Sooner or 分页。。。later a crash is coming, and it may be terrific.” Babson was a devotee of Sir Isaac Newton. His wife, Grace, on a trip to London, had gone so far as to purchase a parlor room salvaged from Newton’s house and have it shipped to the Babson Institute, Roger’s nascent business school in Wellesley, Massachusetts. Babson believed that Newton’s third law of physics applied to financial markets: to every action there is a reaction, and therefore what goes up must come down. Babson had been predicting a decline in stock valuations since the market took off in 1927. He was the first to acknowledge that his pessimism was hardly news. As he put it on September 5 in introducing his remarks, “I am about to repeat what I said at this time last year and the year before.” Even a stopped clock is right twice a day. Babson’s time was about to come.

The Yale University economist Irving Fisher, like Babson, was both a prohibitionist and partial to the goatee. But where Babson was a student of physics, Fisher had been inspired by scenes of water cascading into mountain pools on a summer trip to Switzerland and now sought to apply the principles of hydraulics to the economy. The fact that liquidity was still ample, Durant’s warnings about the future notwithstanding, constituted the basis for Fisher’s soon-to-be-notorious proclamation on October 17 that “Stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.” On Monday, October 21, Fisher doubled down, insisting that any correction was “only shaking out the lunatic fringe.” The Dow Jones average peaked on Tuesday, September 3, at a level that would not be matched for twenty-five years. Share prices fell modestly on September 4 and then sharply on September 5. Thursday the fifth was when Babson gave his speech comparing Wall Street to Florida real estate and predicting the worst. The “Babson Break,” as the 5 percent drop that day came to be known, was a reminder that, as Babson’s hero Newton might have put it, what went up could come down. For seven weeks, stock prices drifted downward. There were periodic up days and also sharp sell-offs, as on Thursday, October 3, when the Dow fell by 4½ percent. Traders who bought stocks on margin were hit. “Mortality among speculative Stock Exchange accounts was tremendous,” wrote the New York Times the following weekend. “Numerous accounts that ran into six figures at the first of the week were entirely extinguished by Friday night.”3 Still, investors were unprepared for what came next. On October 24, “Black Thursday,” the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11 percent at the opening bell. In the first thirty minutes, 1.6 million shares changed hands, exceeding typical turnover for an entire trading day. The quotation machinery and transcontinental wire system were overwhelmed.

A market in this panicked state could not be left to its own devices. Taking a leaf from the book of J. P. Morgan the elder, Thomas Lamont, the leading Morgan partner, summoned Charles Mitchell, chairman of National City Bank; Albert Wiggin, chairman of Chase National Bank; William Potter, president of Guarantee Trust Company; and Seward Prosser, chairman of Bankers Trust. (Jack Morgan himself was in Europe, having been more concerned with conditions there.) After a midday meeting of just twenty minutes, Lamont emerged to address the assembled financial press. The economic and financial situation was “fundamentally sound,” he affirmed, invoking the standard trope to which bankers and politicians resort whenever markets show signs of distress. Using a term made current by the advent of commercial air travel, he dismissed the morning’s drop as the market just hitting an air pocket.

Prices stabilized in the afternoon, whether owing to Lamont’s remarks or to hopes that the bankers were ready to back his words with deeds. Then, however, the market was hit by a wave of sell orders from the West Coast, which was only now absorbing news of the morning’s carnage. Trading volume, at nearly 13 million shares, was more than double the previous daily high. It took the ticker three hours following the close of business to finish spitting out its record of the day’s transactions.

Prices fluctuated uneasily on Friday and again in Saturday’s abbreviated trading, buoyed by rumors of support by a pool of bankers organized by Lamont. Volume remained heavy. On Sunday a normally deserted Wall Street was a hive of activity as clerks toted up the damage and hustling messengers relayed the news. Sightseers “picked up from the street a vagrant piece of ticker tape, as visitors seize upon spent bullets on a battlefield as souvenirs.”4

The Dow Jones industrials lost another 12 percent on “Black Monday,” October 28, and 9 percent the following day, “Black Tuesday,” as the hoped-for bankers’ support failed to materialize. The 16 million shares that changed hands on Tuesday set a record that stood for four decades. Again, traders and bookkeepers were overwhelmed. The Wall Street Bowling League announced that it was postponing further contests owing to the absence of many members.

For margin traders who had lost everything, the New Era was over. “Wall Street was a street of vanished hopes, of curiously silent apprehension and of a sort of paralyzed hypnosis,” the New York Times wrote in its lead story on October 30. For Will Rogers, flying west from New York on October 24, however, it was much sound and fury signifying nothing. All day just looking down on beautiful lands and prosperous towns, then you read all this sensational collapse on Wall Street. What does it mean? Nothing. Why, if the cows of this country failed to come up and get milked one night it would be more of a panic than if Morgan and Lamont had never held a meeting. Why, an old sow and a litter of pigs make more people a living than all the steel and General Motors stock combined. Why, the whole 120,000,000 of us are more dependent on the cackling of a hen than if the stock exchange was turned into a night club.5 Not everyone was able to view the landscape with such equanimity. Still, there was a considerable body of opinion agreeing with Rogers. Retailers continued to plan for a strong Christmas shopping season. The only hint of what was to come was a report from a Wall Street financier who found himself sitting in a bar alongside his milkman. When the banker remarked that the milk business must have been one of the few activities to have come through the Crash unscathed, the milkman retorted “Unscathed nothing. Do you know that in the past three weeks I have had enough cancellations and reductions in cream order to reduce my business by over $400 a month? People still order the same amount of milk, but they have apparently decided that they can get along without the buying of cream.”6 Leverage has long been cited as a factor in the Crash. When prices fell, brokers who had extended credit to investors called for additional margin, forcing their customers to sell into a falling market. The resulting fire sales then fed on themselves. Contemporary accounts are replete with tales of margin accounts “ripped wide open” and investors being wiped out. This was not the first time that markets would be laid low by this combustible mix of leverage and volatility; nor would it be the last.

Lack of information also played a role. This was not simply an East Coast– West Coast phenomenon or the fact that the ticker ran late. On the worst days, accurate price quotations were unavailable on the trading floor itself. In his classic account of Black Thursday, Maury Klein describes a panicked telephone clerk who, when asked for price quotations by a broker, shouted in desperation “I can’t get them. I can’t get any information. The whole place is falling apart.”7 This kind of chaotic environment is a fertile incubator of panic. When prices are a matter of speculation, as it were, investors will be tempted to infer them from the actions of other investors. When they hear investors shouting “sell,” they will conclude that the only prudent course is to do likewise. At that point, the herd will be off and running. Investor mood swings can be self-reinforcing, but they are more likely when they have some basis in fact. Thus, a more systematic way of understanding the investor response is in terms of the softening economy. August marked the business cycle peak, according to the subsequent calculations of the National Bureau of Economic Research. Commerce and Treasury officials may have been unaware, but managers knew that firms, if only their own firms, were cutting back. Automobile production was down to 500,000 units in August from more than 600,000 in April and May.8 In their classic business cycle chronology, Arthur Burns and Wesley Mitchell place the peaks in employment in the iron, lumber, and machinery industries in August, basing their estimates on statistics available at the time.9 Building permits and construction contracts were off sharply. Although some of this may have been the late summer lull, the drop was more pronounced than in prior years.

Such observations would have created doubts about the New Age presumption that recession was no longer a threat to profitability or a factor in stock-market valuations. So would the behavior of the Federal Reserve. The advent of the Fed, charged with providing an elastic currency, was what had supposedly consigned this kind of recession to the dustbin of history. But in fact, it was the Federal Reserve System, and its lower Manhattan branch in particular, that sought to limit credit availability. On August 9, responding to the rise in share prices, the New York Fed raised its discount rate from 5 to 6 percent. The board’s approval of the action was, in effect, a tacit acknowledgment that the earlier policy of direct pressure was not enough. Although 6 percent was still below call money rates, it left the banks little room for error. George Harrison, the Harvard Law School alumnus and longtime Fed staffer who had succeeded to the governorship of the New York Reserve Bank on Benjamin Strong’s death in 1928, argued that the increase would be seen as “a warning against the excessive use of credit.”10 One is reminded how the European Central Bank, similarly unaware that an economic and financial storm was brewing, raised its policy rate in April 2008.

Tighter credit in New York meant tighter credit abroad. European central banks, seeing their currencies weakening and gold stocks dwindling as their residents joined Wall Street’s festivities, met the Fed tit-for-tat. The central banks of Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, and Hungary raised their policy rates in the first half of 1929, this despite the fact that their economies were slowing, or in some cases already in recession. Denmark, Sweden, and Norway then tightened in August in response to the New York Fed’s rate hike. The Bank of England had last raised its discount rate in February. Somewhat surprisingly, it now remained on hold through the summer of 1929. Between June and mid-September the Bank of England’s gold reserves declined by a further $133 million, but still Norman did not move. The British economy was weak, and an increase in interest rates would only aggravate an already difficult economic situation.11 Norman understood that an increase would not be warmly received by Britain’s newly elected Labour government. With the Hague Conference that led to the Young Plan restructuring of German reparations still underway, he was reluctant to take a step that, by drawing gold from Paris, might antagonize the French.

Norman’s hand was then forced by the Hatry Scandal. Clarence Hatry was an odd duck to dictate the course of British monetary policy. The son of a trader in silk and velvet for use in top hats, Hatry was short in stature, like his contemporary Charles Ponzi, whom he vaguely resembled. He also shared with Ponzi a certain entrepreneurial flair and the ability to raise money for dubious projects. And, like Ponzi, he had a miraculous capacity to rehabilitate himself once his earlier business initiatives foundered.

In 1910 the twenty-two-year-old Hatry inherited control of the family silk company from his mother. Within months the business failed and, having put up his personal credit to obtain £8,000 of supplies, Hatry was declared insolvent. Not easily discouraged, he turned next to selling insurance to Austrian immigrants transiting England in order to sail from Liverpool to the United States. Hatry formed the Austrian Immigrants Insurance Association, offering policies that provided for return passage and a resettlement fee if the policyholder was denied entry into the Promised Land. He transferred the risk by reselling the policy to an established carrier, taking as his commission the difference between what the immigrant paid and the cost of the reinsurance.

World War I interrupted the migration of Central Europeans to the United States, putting an end to this business opportunity but creating others. In 1914 Hatry combined the modest profits from his Austrian-immigrant policies with £30,000 of borrowed funds to purchase City Equitable, a reinsurance company. The reinsurance business, then as now, was dominated by German and Austrian firms, so the war created an opening. Hatry reorganized City Equitable to capitalize on the opportunity and within six months sold a controlling interest for £250,000 to Gerard Lee Bevan, a flamboyant British financier, and Bevan’s associate, Peter Haig-Thomas.12 Bevan’s forebears had been founders of Barclays; their descendant, known as Jerry, was a high-living stockbroker with a taste for women and Chinese porcelain. City Equitable collapsed in February 1922 when it was discovered that it had issued false balance sheets understating loans to other Bevan-affiliated companies, disguised its speculative investments, and omitted to report that some of its assets were pledged as security against borrowed funds. Bevan was held personally responsible, having kept his handpicked board of directors ignorant of the machinations. He fled to France and then to Vienna, where he lived in disguise before being discovered and arrested. Extradited to Britain, he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to seven years’ hard labor at Wormwood Scrubs.13

With profits from the sale of City Equitable, Hatry next acquired the Commercial Bank of London, which he used to finance further acquisitions. The result was Amalgamated Industrials, a business empire encompassing shipbuilding, cotton spinning, coal, iron, and pig farming. Hatry’s firms were overcapitalized; he issued more shares than needed for their operation as a way of funding additional acquisitions. Doing so unfortunately made it more difficult to offer investors in the early companies a respectable return. Pig farming, in any case, was the most profitable of those activities; the shipbuilding, cotton spinning, coal, and steel industries all suffered from overcapacity and low prices in the 1920s. Hatry avoided the worst by selling off much of Amalgamated Industrials not long after the war.

Hatry next deployed the Commercial Bank, rebranded as the Commercial Corporation in honor of his extrabanking ambitions, to buy up and consolidate firms in the glass and jute industries. The demand for the products of both had been strong during World War I: glass has myriad wartime uses, and jute fiber was used in making the sandbags so essential for trench warfare. The jute industry was dominated by seven family-owned firms in Dundee, Scotland, where some 90 percent of British production was located, jute manufacturing having used whale oil to soften the fibers before weaving and Dundee having been a major whaling center. The industry was already suffering from chronic overcapacity when the wartime demand for burlap sacking declined. Hatry amalgamated the seven firms, eliminated their excess capacity, and took them public in order to enable the founding families to get their capital out. Unfortunately, demand for jute and glass was weaker in the 1920s than during World War I. Hatry and his directors “failed to appreciate the artificiality of the post-Armistice boom” and “the severity of the reaction which was to follow,” in the words of the liquidator appointed to wind up the Commercial Bank in 1923.14

Not easily discouraged, by 1926 Hatry was back in business, having founded Corporation and General Securities Ltd. Just how he regained the confidence of investors is something of a mystery. He appears to have made some effort to pay off his earlier creditors. He was known for his mental acuity and charm and maintained the lavish lifestyle of a successful entrepreneur, acquiring a racing stable, the largest yacht on British waters, and an elegant home. Two homes, actually. The first, at an address that had once been the abode of the British political economist David Ricardo, featured a rooftop swimming pool where Hatry threw lavish parties.15 Its successor was in the prestigious Mayfair district, where Hatry installed a cocktail bar in the basement and another swimming pool, this one on the second floor.

Corporation and General Securities provided underwriting services to middle-sized businesses and municipalities, competing on price with the established firms that dominated the market. In the manner of Angelo Mozilo and Countrywide Credit, it used direct marketing to attract clients. Before long, Hatry was taking stakes in the companies whose issues he underwrote. His holdings expanded beyond Corporation and General Securities, which now featured Lord Henry Paulet, the Sixteenth Marquess of Winchester, as figurehead, to include also the Drapery Trust, which specialized in amalgamating department stores, and the Photomaton Corporation, which placed coin-inthe-slot photography machines in railway stations and amusement parks. By 1929 Hatry was setting his sights still higher, seeking to acquire United Steel Companies, an enterprise valued at £7 million. United Steel was formed in 1917 as a combination of several steel companies under the leadership of the eponymous Harry Steel. The conglomerate was heavily indebted and therefore vulnerable to soft demand. Demand being soft in the 1920s, Steel was receptive when Hatry proposed to purchase United Steel and its subsidiaries using borrowed funds, sell off their redundant assets, and float the resulting concern on the London Stock Exchange. The strategy was not unlike the one he had employed when forming Jute Industries. It was also not unlike that of a modern private equity firm such as Bain Capital.

The main challenge was borrowing the £8 million. Unfortunately, Norman’s decision back in February to increase the Bank of England’s discount rate made raising cash more difficult than Hatry anticipated when launching the buyout. The banks demanded collateral, something that Hatry, lavish lifestyle notwithstanding, did not possess in abundance.

Finding himself £900,000 short and with the deadline for completing the transaction approaching, Hatry resorted to desperate measures. Corporate and General Securities having underwritten a number of municipal loans, Hatry still held copies of the bonds of the cities in question. He now printed unauthorized loan certificates for Gloucester, Swindon, and Wakefield as security for additional loans. He raised cash by informing the municipalities for which Corporate and General had provided underwriting services that only some of their bonds had been successfully placed, where in truth the placement was complete, and kept the difference in subscriptions for himself. In addition, Hatry made duplicate copies of securities issued by one of his companies, Associated Automatic Machines, and held by another, the Austin Friars Trust. The same stock certificates securing advances from Barclays Bank were used to secure a loan from Parsons and Co., and then another from Lloyds Bank.16

Desperation breeding recklessness, Hatry did not even bother to pledge different securities to various branches of the same bank. While the head office of Lloyds took 100,000 shares in Associated Automatic Machines as collateral, the St. James branch was offered duplicates as collateral for another loan. It did not take long for a clerk to discover the problem and for Lloyds to hire a chartered accountant, Sir Gilbert Garnsey, to investigate its extent. Nor did it take long for word of Garnsey’s engagement to spread, and shares in Hatry’s companies to collapse.

In the meantime, Hatry borrowed more money to purchase shares in his companies, ward off insolvency, and buy time to gamble for redemption, but in so doing he only dug himself a deeper hole. This pattern became commonplace as the crisis worsened: individuals and institutions experiencing financial distress, operating in an environment of lax regulation, purchased shares in their own enterprises in order to suppress evidence of their insolvency and buy time to gamble for redemption, but in so doing only made for themselves—and society—even larger losses. This was the same practice in which the Bank of United States engaged in 1929 when other investors began to sell its shares in response to worries about solvency, and in which Albert Oustric engaged to ward off failure of his Banque Adam in 1930. It was a practice that would be taken to new heights by management of the big Icelandic banks in 2008.17

On September 20, 1929, the Marquess of Winchester issued a statement acknowledging that an investigation of Hatry’s affairs was underway. Norman, who had long been suspicious of the flamboyant financier, so informed the London Stock Exchange, which suspended trading in the Hatry Group the same morning. By the close of business, Hatry was arrested and jailed. He was quickly indicted and brought to trial shortly after the New Year. Counsel suggested that the scheme that had brought him down was hatched not by Hatry himself by his voluble Italian colleague, John Gialdini, who properly deserved the blame. Gialdini had threatened to blow his brains out if the United Steel acquisition fell through, before conveniently fleeing the country. No matter; Hatry was convicted and sentenced to the white-collar maximum of fourteen years.18 Eventually Gialdini was also arrested, found guilty at the conclusion of a trial in Milan, and sentenced to five years and ten months of imprisonment. The contrast with the treatment of white-collar criminals in the wake of the 2008–09 crisis is too obvious to warrant comment. Inevitably, Hatry’s shareholders were wiped out. In addition, some £12.5 million of unsecured liabilities were frozen as a result of the suspension of his companies.19 A number of London stockbrokers failed, and several banks, including Barclays, announced that their profits would take a hit.20 One of the few beneficiaries of the episode was, ironically, United Steel, which was able to write down its financial obligations as a result of the subsequent bankruptcy and emerged from reorganization in a stronger financial position.21

But in the short run, these events precipitated a sharp fall in the London Stock Exchange and gold losses for the Bank of England. On September 26 Norman bowed to the inevitable, announcing a one-point increase in the discount rate.

The result, a higher cost of credit, was unhelpful for a struggling British economy. But defense of the pound’s gold standard parity was paramount. Gold losses, whatever their cause—including Hatry—demanded a reaction. The situation would be different after September 1931, when there was no longer a gold standard to defend. It would be different in the global crisis of 2008–09, when, unconstrained by an exchange rate commitment, the Bank of England, like the Fed, could cut interest rates to a rock-bottom level. For the moment, however, the Bank’s priority remained defense of the sterling exchange rate. And that required Norman to tighten the screws. The US Federal Reserve, unlike the Bank of England, still had ample gold reserves. But although free to act, it had to display the will. Following a tumultuous October 28, Black Monday, the New York Fed quickly stepped into the breach. Harrison assembled his board for an exceptional 3:00 a.m. meeting. Before the markets opened the next morning and without prior approval from the board of governors in Washington, D.C., he announced that the New York bank would purchase $100 million of short-term treasury securities. The new purchases were made for the New York bank’s own account, separate from the account of the Open Market Investment Committee.

The New York Fed went on to purchase $150 million of government securities. It kept its “discount window wide open,” as Harrison put it, giving banks cash in return for commercial paper.22 (Commercial paper, recall, means promissory notes documenting payments that the banks would eventually receive from their corporate clients.) These steps prevented a spike in interest rates like those in earlier financial crises—prevention of such spikes being the main rationale for the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1914. By limiting distress among brokers and dealers, the New York Fed averted a more serious meltdown. The New York Times praised it for having “insured the soundness of the business situation when the speculative markets went on the rocks.”23 This was impressively fast action even by the standards of Ben Bernanke. It is hard to see how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York could have done more. Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, in their monetary history of the United States, blame the Fed for the depth and duration of the Great Depression. They attribute its inaction to the death of Benjamin Strong, the dominant personality within the system and the individual who best understood how to respond to a crisis. The events of October suggest a more nuanced interpretation. The New York Fed may have been unaware of the havoc that would be wreaked by earlier moves to tighten credit conditions. But once that havoc broke out, Harrison and his colleagues were quick to act. Their actions informed by the real bills doctrine, they knew how to respond to signs of credit stringency and distress. Harrison, in particular, understood the urgency. It was not beyond his capacity to formulate a response and secure the backing of his board. He was capable of decisive action and took it.

One might think that a board of governors similarly beholden to the real bills doctrine would have been reassured. In fact, however, more concerned about prerogatives than policy, its members were furious about not having been consulted. Led by Adolph Miller, the board immediately took steps to limit Harrison’s ability to respond in this fashion. The precedent had been set in 1927 when the board overrode the directors of the Chicago Fed, forcing the bank to change its discount rate. Now the board held the New York rate hostage, denying Harrison’s request for a reduction to help distressed banks and brokers until New York’s directors agreed that further purchases of government securities would be made only with the prior approval of the board. Friedman and Schwartz suggest that the problem was with Harrison—that, had Strong been there instead, he would have been able to face down the board. The fact that the terms of engagement between the board and the Reserve banks had already been changed by the events of 1927 suggests otherwise. The problem was structural, not one of personalities.

But if Harrison and his colleagues understood the need to respond quickly to the financial distress caused by the stock market crash, they understood less well how to respond to subsequent events. So long as the problem was financial distress, they understood it was their responsibility to provide emergency liquidity, in contemporary parlance an elastic currency. That the stock market crash placed New York banks at risk was something the directors of the New York Fed readily grasped.

But once the problem became deflation and depression, there was less agreement on what to do, if anything. The Federal Reserve System had been created to prevent spikes in interest rates. Its officials knew how to respond when, as a result of financial dislocations, credit temporarily grew scarce relative to the needs of business. There was no consensus, however, about what to do if the price level showed a tendency to fall for a period of time. The US price level had trended downward before, in the 1870s and 1880s and again in the aftermath of World War I, without producing a full-blown financial crisis. For Federal Reserve governors, their views informed by this historical experience, it was not obvious that the downward movement in prices was a problem now.

As stringency in the money market ebbed and interest rates normalized, action therefore was perceived as less urgent. The views of Harrison and his directors now aligned with those of the board of governors. The New York bank no longer resisted the instructions of Washington, D.C. To the contrary, it became entirely willing to cease and desist from open market purchases.24 The economy would quickly pay the price.
