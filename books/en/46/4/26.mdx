title: Chapter 26 Euro or Not
---



The united kingdom, like the United States, Ireland, and Spain, experienced a phenomenal housing boom that turned to bust.1 It had an overgrown financial sector that accounted for as much as 10 percent of gross value added and more than a quarter of all corporate income tax payments but was now forced to retrench. For an economy with these features, a recession of some magnitude was baked in.

But not a recession of this magnitude and duration. The UK took until 2014 to regain the 2008 level of GDP, lagging every other Group of Seven advanced economy with the sole exception of Italy.2 These aspects of the British downturn were products of policy. Starting in 2010, the UK’s fiscal stance turned strongly contractionary. The May 2010 general election saw voters repudiate the Labour government of Gordon Brown and led to the formation of a Conservative-Liberal coalition headed by David Cameron. The new government was bent on eliminating the deficit by any means necessary. To that end, Cameron’s chancellor, George Osborne, submitted his own version of an emergency budget in 2010 that featured front-loaded spending cuts and an increase in value-added tax.

The resulting fiscal consolidation was the most severe undertaken by any of the large advanced economies, more than 5 percent of GDP between 2009 and 2012. The effects were immediate and severe. The British economy had initially stopped contracting at the end of 2009, and GDP growth recovered to ½ percent in the first half of 2010 and then 1 percent in the third quarter. At that point, however, the effects of Osborne’s budget were felt. The fourth quarter of 2010 saw the economy contracting again by 0.2 percent. 2011 was then a year of bouncing along the bottom, with limp growth in the first and 分页。。。third quarters and contraction in the second and fourth. The Office of Budget Responsibility, the UK’s independent, nonpartisan advisory body, estimated that economic growth was more than 1 percent lower than otherwise in the 2010–11 fiscal year as a result of these policies. It was then 0.7 percent lower in 2011–12 and 0.3 percent lower in 2012–13 as the initial impact of earlier policies began to fade.3

The coalition’s response was to stay the course. This led to the exceptional situation where the IMF recommended shifting public spending toward items that would do more to boost demand in the short run. It further recommended that the government consider, in the absence of evidence of recovery, slowing the pace of fiscal tightening.4

This turn to austerity was also exceptional in that the UK did not share the constraints of other European countries. Debt may have been too high for comfort, but it was still less than 70 percent of GDP when the coalition took over in 2010. The UK was not Greece, to invoke a familiar phrase; the costs of loans and capital injections into the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Northern Rock, and Bradford & Bingley, amounting to roughly 8 percent of GDP, had already been sunk.5 Nor was it Ireland, in other words.

Most important, the UK was not a member of the Eurozone. It had a central bank with the power to print money and backstop the market in the government’s bonds. This gave the government more fiscal space than a comparably indebted Eurozone country. Fiscal consolidation could have been back-loaded. It could have waited until the economy was strong enough to handle it.

All this renders the coalition’s obsession with austerity more than a little difficult to understand. Cameron’s Chancellor Osborne, like Blair’s Chancellor Brown, was a student of history, in his case having taken the subject at Oxford. This, however, did not prevent him from disregarding the history of the 1930s or embracing the “Treasury view” of fiscal policy. In 1929, the view of the Treasury that “any increase in government spending necessarily crowds out an equal amount of private spending or investment, and thus has no net impact on economic activity,” in the words of Chancellor Winston Churchill, was invoked in opposition to an increase in the deficit.6 Chancellor Osborne and others in Treasury were not prepared to go quite this far in arguing that fiscal consolidation was likely to have no net impact on economic growth, but they did argue that the effects were unlikely to be large. They argued further that not proceeding with consolidation would have adverse implications. Failing to narrow the deficit would expose the UK to the kind of confidence crisis already affecting Greece, Ireland, and Spain, depressing investment and growth. This, of course, confused the situation of a country like the UK, with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 70 percent, with a country like Greece, whose debt-toGDP ratio was closer to 170 percent. It confused the situation of a set of Eurozone countries that no longer possessed a national central bank capable of backstopping the government bond market with the situation of a country still possessing its own central bank. Having shown the wisdom to stay out of Europe’s flawed monetary union, Britain now embraced the flawed logic that it was required to behave like a monetary union member.

Cameron and Osborne, it should be noted, were staunch believers in Conservative doctrine of a limited state. And when better to limit the state than in a supposed crisis of fiscal sustainability, with, absent early action, the debt/GDP ratio poised to cross the red line of 90 percent of GDP?7 In October 2010, as part of its fiscal consolidation effort, the government released a list of 192 public agencies that would be abolished or have their funding withdrawn. They ranged from the Infrastructure Planning Commission to the Health Protection Agency, which provided information and advice to health professionals and the general public on new and emerging health threats, and the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency, which sought to promote and coordinate the use of information technology in education. Many of these agencies, it will be clear, were involved in mobilizing resources for infrastructure, education, and research.8 Better, in the Conservative view, to let the market do the mobilizing and get government out of the way. Other agencies that were axed, like the UK Film Council and the Farm Animal Welfare Council, were symbols of government ambition that the Conservative-led coalition now sought to uproot. If a short recession—short being what the Coalition anticipated—was the price for eliminating this wasteful spending and these intrusive government agencies, then it was a price worth paying. As Jeremy Warner of the conservatively oriented Daily Telegraph candidly put it, “In the end, you are either a big-state person, or a small-state person, and what big-state people hate about austerity is that its primary purpose is to shrink the size of government spending. . . . The bottom line is that you can only really make serious inroads into the size of the state during an economic crisis. This may be pro-cyclical, but there is never any appetite for it in good times; it can only be done in the bad.”9

Finally, there is no denying the element of political expediency involved. Like the Obama stimulus, Labour’s emergency budget had not delivered everything promised. Thus, when the Conservatives and Liberals campaigned against Labour’s failed policies, they campaigned against deficit spending. As in the United States, their arguments resonated with a voting public that instinctively embraced the analogy between the household budget and the government budget and sought an outlet for its anger with the crisis and the government-funded bailouts of financial institutions mounted in response. Proceeding with fiscal consolidation allowed the Coalition to tar Labour as the party of deficits. It took a divided US government several years to agree on tax increases for the 1 percent and the Sequester. In the British system, which did not admit of divided government, the shift to austerity was immediate and severe. If the UK undertook a major fiscal consolidation, on the order of 5 percent of GDP, this was nothing compared to what was asked of Greece. The Troika program specified spending cuts and tax increases of fully 11 percentage points of GDP over three years. This was more than Greek society, and for that matter any society, could sustain, making some slippage unavoidable. Drastic spending cuts made deep recession inevitable, tall tales of expansionary fiscal consolidation notwithstanding. As we saw above, the recession was significantly deeper than forecast by the Troika. And the further the Greek economy sank, the more by which tax revenues undershot projections, and the higher the debt/GDP ratio rose.

The IMF under Dominique Strauss-Kahn was anxious to support the Europeans in their plans. But by May 2011 Strauss-Kahn was out, having been forced to resign following accusations that he sexually assaulted a housekeeper at the Sofitel New York Hotel.10 The IMF operated under rules permitting it to lend only when it had an expectation of being paid back. It was permitted to grant a country “exceptional access”—that is, to lend more than six times its quota subscription in the institution—only if it judged the debt to be sustainable. Already in May 2010 the Fund’s normally pliant staff had felt unable to certify that the Greek government’s debt was “sustainable with a high probability,” forcing the executive board to provide a waiver on the grounds that not lending would cause terrible contagion to other countries. But the longer the Greek crisis festered, the more difficult it was for the IMF to continue to lend under such circumstances. Special rules for European countries raised the ire of directors representing Latin America, which had not enjoyed such privileges when experiencing debt crises of their own. At the same time, the idea that Greece would be able to return to the markets in 2012, once more selling bonds to private investors, was a pipe dream.

Something had to give. One option would have been for the country’s EU partners to shower it with more money. But at this point the Greek bailout was politically toxic, not just in Germany but in the Netherlands, Finland, and other Northern European countries. By process of elimination, officials were led to think the unthinkable: the debt would have to be restructured. For a year and a half, aside from the walk on the beach at Deauville, European leaders had denied that debt restructuring was feasible. The prospect of restructuring, with significant losses for bondholders, would create chaos in financial markets. Institutional investors would be bankrupted. They would dump the bonds of other troubled Eurozone countries. Greece would be tied up in litigation for years. Jürgen Stark, Germany’s man on the ECB executive board, warned that a Greek restructuring would be a “catastrophe.” His executive board colleague Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, formerly director general at the Italian Ministry of Finance, warned the Greek government that restructuring was “political suicide” and that any step in this direction would “jeopardize all of Europe.”11

The reality, of course, was just the opposite. It was possible, events would show, for Greece to restructure its debt and obtain significant relief with a minimum of uncertainty and a maximum of investor participation. Money could be set aside to recapitalize its banks, and banks elsewhere could prepare for the inevitable. With support from the institutions of the European Union, other countries could be sheltered from the fallout. But changing course would be a blow to the credibility of European officials like Stark and Bini Smaghi, who had warned that restructuring would be Armageddon. Before long they would be former European officials.

The result was another year of waffling and delay. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble first proposed that the IMF and ECB organize a “voluntary” debt exchange in which investors would receive longer-maturity bonds but concede no debt reduction. What advantage this would have for the Greek government was never clear. Next a committee of French banks tabled a proposal that again included no nominal debt reduction. The Institute of International Finance, an association of big institutional investors, proposed exchanging the outstanding bonds for four new bonds with different durations and coupons. The new bonds would help Greece with its immediate financing problem by providing cash flow relief. But the plan required minimal concessions of investors and perversely increased the debt with which the Greek government was encumbered.12

It is not surprising that the banks preferred a deal that maximized their returns. But that did not mean it helped with the Greek government’s economic and financial problems. This was a clear failure of leadership by the IMF and the EU, which allowed the banks to call the tune and asked Greece to dance to it. If officials had consciously sought to roil the markets, this would have been how to go about it.

After three more months of dithering, European leaders finally acknowledged that the longer they waited, the worse things became. At their summit on October 26, 2011, they finally “invited” all parties to develop a bond exchange that would cut the value of Greek debt to private investors by 50 percent. After four more months of discussions, the Greek government finally made investors a take-it-or-leave-it offer. It turned out to be an offer they couldn’t refuse. When the deal closed in April 2012, more than 97 percent of private investors accepted. The face value of their bonds was reduced by more than half, and the new bonds bore lower interest payments than their predecessors. More than €100 billion of Greek debt was vaporized. This, then, was the orderly restructuring that European officials had dismissed as a mythical beast. It was the first major debt exchange in Europe since World War II. It was the largest debt exchange in history.

What made it possible?

First, 60 percent of Greek bonds were held by banks and other investors susceptible to arm twisting by their governments. Those governments saw a successful restructuring, now that it was underway, as in the public interest and dropped not very thinly veiled hints about the adverse consequences of not going along.

Second, it helped that 86 percent of Greek government bonds were subject to Greek law, so their provisions could be changed by a simple act of the Hellenic Parliament. (The remainder had been issued under English law, making it subject to British courts.) The parliament took advantage of this by passing a measure that authorized the Greek-law bonds to be restructured if a qualified majority of bondholders agreed.13 Potential holdouts, now subject to majority rule, had no legal recourse, as they were quick to realize. More positively from the point of view of the bondholders, the new bonds were governed by English law, meaning they included protections that the old Greek-law bonds lacked.

This was progress at last. Unfortunately, achieving it took nearly two and a half years, during which the Greek people labored under a crushing burden and the credibility of all parties suffered. Nor was the debt relief that Greece obtained obviously enough. The €42 billion of Greek bonds held by the ECB, together with the €13 billion of bonds in the hands of national central banks, were not restructured. Government debt was still a crushing 150 percent of GDP.

There were no celebrations in Athens. The recession continued to deepen. Increasingly the question was when the next restructuring, this time involving debt held by the official sector, would occur. All along, the ECB was steadfastly opposed to any form of debt restructuring. The idea was resisted, as we have seen, by members of its governing council from Jean-Claude Trichet on down. These worthies were aware that the ECB was a substantial holder of Southern European bonds. They understood that if the logic of restructuring was allowed to play out, the institution’s balance sheet would take a hit. They worried that the ECB would have to intervene with further bond purchases to protect governments and banks elsewhere from the fallout.

Preoccupation with its profit-and-loss statement is not what one expects of an institution charged with ensuring the stability of financial markets and the economy. ECB officials were no doubt sensitive to the fact that politicians, notably in Germany, would be displeased if the ECB took losses on its portfolio. But it was properly the responsibility of those officials to frame the discussion and direct attention to the central bank’s higher duties. This began to happen after the presidency of the central bank passed from Trichet to the former Italian Treasury and Goldman Sachs economist Mario Draghi, notably when Draghi vowed in the summer of 2012 that the ECB would do what it took to preserve and defend the Eurozone. Better late than never.

In other ways as well, the ECB compounded the Eurozone’s plight. In 2010 it erroneously concluded that recovery was underway and began phasing out its nonstandard monetary measures.14 It remained fixated on headline inflation, raising interest rates in the spring and summer of 2011 in response to a transient spike in food and fuel prices. With the German economy still growing, one can’t help but think that the ECB’s action was taken more with German than Eurozone-wide concerns in mind. Raising rates at this juncture tightened the screws on financially strapped banks and firms and made life harder for governments. Interest rates on Spanish and Italian bonds shot up, inaugurating the next and more serious phase of the crisis.

ECB officials hesitated to do more to support growth because they feared that doing more would relieve the pressure on Southern European governments to reform. Lower interest rates and more extensive securities purchases that helped European economies to grow would make fiscal consolidation less urgent. They would weaken the pressure to implement politically difficult reforms.

The resulting pattern became predictable. Whenever the situation turned truly dire, the ECB would do just enough to hold things together. It would activate its Securities Market Programme (SMP), purchasing the bonds of Southern European countries facing soaring funding costs and helping European banks seeking to unload them.15 It would loosen the terms of the Longer-Term Refinancing Operations (LTROs) under which it provided liquidity to the banks.16 But as soon as the patient stabilized, the medication was curtailed. The SMP was suspended.17 The conditions attached to LTROs were tightened. The economic situation then predictably deteriorated, raising fears about the survival of the euro. The ECB would respond by reactivating the SMP and liberalizing the conditions attached to its LTROs.

The result was a stop-and-go policy, first under Trichet and then under Draghi, that provided inadequate support for the European economy. The M3 money supply grew by a disastrously low 0.6 percent in 2010 and by just 1.5 percent in 2011. For an economy capable of growing by 1 to 2 percent and a central bank with a 2 percent inflation target, one would have liked to see M3 grow by at least 4 percent. In late 2011, following the ECB’s two “proactive” interest-rate hikes, bank lending to the private sector again went into decline. It then fell steadily over the course of 2012.18 The central bank’s inconsistency, repeatedly turning on the tap to prevent the subject from expiring from dehydration but then turning it off with the goal of encouraging it to proceed more quickly to the oasis, greatly compounded the difficulties of the European economy.

The unavoidable conclusion is that the ECB, like the Fed in the 1920s, misunderstood its mission. The Fed’s first responsibility then was not to help Britain back onto the gold standard or to deflate the Wall Street bubble but rather to tailor supplies of money and credit to the needs of the US economy. The ECB’s first responsibility now was not to ratchet up the pressure for fiscal and structural reform but to use monetary policy to maintain a respectable rate of M3 growth and otherwise support financial stability and growth. The Fed, in the Great Depression, learned its lesson the hard way. The ECB, it should be noted, was only thirteen years old in 2012 when the consequences of these mistakes came to a head—the same age as the Federal Reserve in 1926, when the Florida real estate bubble burst—not that this qualified as an excuse.

By the summer of 2012, the situation was dire. Europe was back in recession. Government bonds had been downgraded once more by the rating agencies. Ten-year Spanish and Italian bonds were trading at interest rates 500 basis points above those on ten-year German bunds. Depositors were fleeing Southern European banks. The Dutch and Finnish governments were in revolt against extension of more financial assistance. The intentions of the new Greek government formed in the wake of the May–June legislative elections remained unclear. The possibility that Greece might abandon the euro was widely mooted.19 This, it was feared, would open the door to a wider Eurozone collapse. If the goal of ECB officials was to keep the pressure on Southern European countries, in this at least they succeeded. But by putting the survival of the Eurozone at risk, they went too far. This recognition prompted Draghi’s statement on July 26, 2012, at an investor conference in London, that “the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.”20

Draghi’s announcement was followed by the decision of the Governing Council to establish a program of Outright Monetary Transactions. OMT, as it quickly became known, was a mechanism for purchasing the bonds of troubled European countries. It was not unlike the Securities Market Programme that preceded it, with two exceptions. First, it did not come with a ceiling on purchases or a terminal date. Second, ECB purchases of bonds on the secondary market were conditional on the government of the country in question negotiating an adjustment program with the European Stability Mechanism, the EU’s rescue fund. With this program in place, the ECB could provide as much support as the government and banks might require. It could do whatever it took.21 The crisis taught the United States some hard lessons about the inadequacies of financial regulation, though acting on those lessons was more easily said than done. It similarly taught Europe some painful lessons about the flaws in its monetary union. Fiscal discipline was inadequate. Surveillance by the European Commission regularly ignored other developments affecting the stability of the union, such as the capital flows that allowed for the deterioration of competitive positions in the south. Europe lacked a single supervisor capable of reining in the banks that were the conduits of those cross-border flows. There was no mechanism for transfers of budgetary resources from high-unemployment regions to low. Europe learned, at considerable cost to itself, the difficulties that resulted from monetary union without banking and fiscal union.

In the United States, it was immensely complicated to get the executive and legislative branches to agree on reforms. This was nothing, however, compared to the difficulty of getting seventeen euro-area governments to agree, much less twenty-seven when the reforms in question involved not just the euro area but the entire European Union. At any point in time there was an election pending in some member state, causing the reform process to be caught up in politics. The German Constitutional Court might rule the latest directive of the Commission or policy of the ECB inconsistent with the country’s national constitution.22 Far-reaching reforms could require revisions of Europe’s treaties. But this threatened to open the Pandora’s box of Europe’s most basic rules and understandings. With some governments obliged to put treaty revisions to a public referendum, the outcome was uncertain. And if there was one thing European leaders had learned, it was that markets do not react well to uncertainty.

Moreover, the dominant narrative, which set abstemious Germans against profligate Greeks and, more generally, thrifty Northern Europeans against spendthrift Southerners, played up distributional aspects of the crisis. It highlighted the conflicting interests of the parties to the reform effort. None of this made progress easy.

So reform proceeded haltingly. Efforts focused initially on strengthening oversight of budgetary policies as a way of assuaging the German public. The response took the form of six new EU regulations and directives known as the “six-pack,” perhaps to appeal to beer-loving Germans.23 These changes were designed to strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact, under which governments committed to targeting budget deficits of no more than 3 percent of GDP and public debts of no more than 60 percent, or at least to making progress toward those goals. The six-pack provided a concrete definition of what constituted a “significant deviation” from such progress. It allowed procedures leading to sanctions and fines to be launched against a country making insufficient headway in reducing its debt ratio toward 60 percent and not just against countries with a deficit above 3 percent. It required countries to target a structural deficit, with cyclical effects removed, of no more than 0.5 percent of GDP.24

These new rules were supposed to be made more credible and enforceable by requiring a qualified majority of EU member states to vote to overturn the application of sanctions, rather than requiring a qualified majority to vote to apply them.25 The new rules were now to be embedded in national law by the member states, each of which was instructed to pass a legislative act or constitutional amendment to that effect. Compliance with this law or constitutional provision was to be monitored by an independent national agency equivalent to the US Congressional Budget Office. The European Court of Justice, for its part, was empowered to impose sanctions or fines on countries failing to adopt those laws and constitutional amendments, or to create those independent councils. For more than ten years European countries had shown great alacrity in ignoring the Stability and Growth Pact; governments sought to tie their hands without much success. Whether this strengthened set of restraints would work better only time would tell.

The second item on the reform agenda was banking union. In principle this meant a single supervisor responsible for overseeing the operation of banks across the Eurozone or the European Union so that the implications of their activities not just domestically but across borders would be properly taken into account. It meant a single deposit insurance scheme to rule out beggar-thy-neighbor changes in deposit insurance policies like Ireland’s in 2008. And it meant a mechanism for winding up insolvent banks, backed by a common fund akin to that administered by the FDIC in the United States.

Again, more easily said than done. National supervisors were reluctant to cede their prerogatives. No EU institution possessed the competence to supervise more than six thousand banks spread across seventeen countries, and it was not clear how quickly such competence could be acquired. There was no agreement on where to house the single supervisor, inside the ECB, where information could be shared with the lender of last resort, or in a separate self-standing agency so as to minimize conflicts with the central bank’s price stability mandate. A common deposit insurance scheme and single resolution mechanism were resisted in Germany for fear that German banks and taxpayers would end up footing the bill for the mess created by banks in other countries. The realism of such fears was questionable, since German banks were as highly leveraged, poorly governed, and troubled as any. But the dominant narrative, in which frugal Germans were forced to bail out improvident Greeks and Spaniards, continued to shape perceptions and hinder reform efforts.

The result, after a year of delay, was agreement in 2013 to designate the ECB as the single supervisor while building a Chinese wall between its monetary and supervisory functions. Separate boards would oversee the two activities. One hundred thirty large institutions engaged in extensive cross-border activities would be supervised by the ECB, while the rest would continue to be overseen by their respective national supervisors, “subject to the authority” of the ECB, whatever that meant. After six more months of negotiation, there was then agreement on the structure of a common resolution scheme, but one in which the funding would initially come from national authorities, not the Eurozone as a whole. This agreement consequently did nothing to break the diabolic loop between banking and debt crises.26

Fiscal transfers between booming and depressed regions were the hardest nut to crack. François Hollande, the Socialist leader elected French president in mid-2012 by voters who expressed in no uncertain terms their displeasure with Nicolas Sarkozy’s handling of the crisis, floated a proposal for joint funding of a Europe-wide unemployment insurance fund. This landed with a thud in Berlin. The same was true of schemes for Eurobonds backed by Eurozone countries as a group. For Germany, as for other countries that identified as Northern European, this was a bridge too far.

Thus, the task of completing Europe’s monetary house continued to resemble the home renovation project that never ends. In both Europe and the United States, the policy initiatives taken in response to the crisis were just enough to prevent the collapse of monetary arrangements and financial systems. They were just enough to ward off a contraction on the scale of the Great Depression. It may not have felt that way in Athens or in Stockton, California. But the conclusion stands. Central banks, in Mario Draghi’s words, were prepared to do what it took. Governments, their views of what constituted an appropriate response likewise informed by the experience of the 1930s, were similarly prepared to use fiscal policy to stabilize demand and avert a contraction as severe as the Great Depression.

But their very success encouraged second thoughts. It was inevitable that some of the assistance provided by central banks and spending ministries would flow to banks and nonbank financial institutions, since credit is the lifeblood of the market system. But as anger swelled against the financial institutions implicated in the crisis, it fueled a backlash against the central banks and fiscal authorities that stepped into help them. Moreover, politicians overpromised, as politicians are prone to do. When a serious recession followed, even if not a recession as serious as the Great Depression, their policies were dismissed as failed. Vast deficits and the unprecedented expansion of central bank balance sheets excited fears of inflation and were hard for politicians to defend. Subtle arguments about the difference between household and government budgets or about the benign implications of monetary expansion when the economy is in a liquidity trap were hard to impress on a public accustomed to sound bites.

Thus, in the first round of elections that followed the crisis, deficits and central bank activism became political liabilities. Office holders seeking to maintain their majorities, knowing which way the wind was blowing, embraced austerity. Central banks limited interventions for fear that doing more might excite critics and jeopardize their independence. If the initial response prevented a contraction on the scale of the Great Depression, the turn to fiscal austerity and monetary restraint now prevented the recovery from matching that of the 1930s.

The same was true of financial reform. Efforts to strengthen regulation were less far-reaching than analogous efforts following the Great Depression. There is no question but that the prevailing system of regulation had failed catastrophically, provoking calls for root-and-branch changes. But this time the economic consequences of that failure were more successfully contained. The same was true of the financial consequences: where the Standard & Poor’s index fell by more than 85 percent between its peak in September 1929 and the trough in July, it fell by “just” 57 percent in the seventeen months following its October 9, 2007, peak and then recovered more quickly.27 As a result, fundamental reform seemed less urgent. The architects of the prevailing system may not have emerged from the crisis with their reputations burnished, but neither were they discredited to the same degree as in the 1930s. Hence they could become the architects of reform.

All this the United States and Europe had in common. What Europe had in addition was an unfinished monetary union that was impossible to dismantle and equally impossible to complete. When in the 1930s reaching international agreement on adoption of reflationary policies proved impossible, countries moved unilaterally, abandoning the gold standard and reflating on their own. Unilateralism had costs. International trade and comity suffered. But unilateralism at least created the policy space needed for depressed economies to recover.

Informed by this experience, the experts were quick to predict that Greece, accompanied perhaps by Europe’s other crisis countries, would exit the Eurozone. But the euro proved more resilient than the gold standard. Reintroducing a national currency where one no longer existed was more difficult than devaluing an existing unit. The members of the European Union had even more invested in the euro than did governments in the 1930s in the gold standard. Along with their monetary union, they had a single market and political arrangements fifty years in the making. That these could be imperiled by dismantling the Eurozone was the implication of exit limited initially even to one country.

The Greeks were understandably incensed about being subjected to humiliating inspections by the Troika and by the endless recession to which they were now consigned. The Germans were outraged over being asked to bail out their profligate neighbors and being labeled brutal paymasters for their efforts. But when push came to shove, both sides were prepared to do just enough to hold the Eurozone together. Germany and its European Union partners provided emergency loans, not once but repeatedly. Greece swallowed hard and accepted deep cuts in public-sector salaries and social programs, not once but over a succession of years. In neither case did voters turn to anti-euro parties in numbers as large as in the 1930s. The Greeks had no desire to go down in history as the pariahs who demolished the euro and the European Union. The Germans, as beneficiaries of those arrangements, in the end understood that they had to sacrifice to make them work.

Here, then, the history of the 1930s was an imperfect guide to policy outcomes. Where the earlier crisis led to the collapse of the gold standard, this one did not lead to the collapse of the Eurozone. At least not yet.
