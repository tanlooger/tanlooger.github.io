In this way the Troika succeeded in transforming the Greek crisis into an existential crisis for the euro and the European Union. This is giving one blunder a lot of credit—but then, credit where credit is due. Encumbering Greece with debt to the Troika in addition to its debt to private creditors saddled the country with a crushing burden. The imposition of painful conditions was resented, more so as it became apparent that the program would not deliver the rapid resumption of growth. If support for reforms crumbled, the Troika might pull the plug. It was no longer inconceivable that the Greek government would abandon the euro and start printing money. The idea that the euro was irreversible was a casualty of this series of missteps. The damage would take years to repair.

A second casualty was the credibility of a Europe whose crisis-containment plans were shown to be incredible. Having seen the European Commission and the ECB, with IMF acquiescence, commit to an implausible set of policies, investors now questioned their competence. It did not take long for the public more generally to lose faith in the technocrats in Brussels and Frankfurt.

In addition, letting Greece’s creditors off scot-free (for such was the implication of eschewing debt restructuring) offended the sensibility of taxpayers already on the hook for costly bank bailouts. And if voters were offended, their leaders had to display suitable indignation. At a bilateral meeting in the French seaside resort of Deauville in October 2010, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy agreed that investors should share the costs of future crises instead of leaving taxpayers liable. In the future, a government experiencing a crisis would be expected to make its bondholders a take-it-or-leave-it offer. They would be asked to exchange their existing bonds for new ones worth, 分页。。。say, fifty cents on the euro as a condition of official assistance. With the full weight of the European Union behind the government in question, the creditors would have no choice but to agree.

Merkel and Sarkozy’s statement was a response to the political backlash unleashed by the failure of the Greek program to impose any burden sharing on private interests.1 But this unqualified declaration that there would be a restructuring whenever a country got into trouble sounded alarm bells for investors. Yields on Irish, Spanish, and Portuguese bonds shot up. As a result of Merkel and Sarkozy’s walk on the beach, doubts about European debts were generalized. One troubled country after another lost access to financial markets. Jean-Claude Trichet was apoplectic. Attending a meeting with finance ministers and other high EU officials when news of the Franco-German deal broke, he reportedly shouted, “You’re going to destroy the euro!” (In French— so much for those much-vaunted German language lessons.)

Had European leaders purposely set out to create a fiscal and financial crisis, they couldn’t have done a better job. In alarm, Merkel and Sarkozy backtracked on their Deauville commitment. Debts were sacrosanct, they declared, and would not be restructured after all. But the damage was done. The taboo over restructuring was broken.

The reality, of course, was that some debt restructuring was inevitable, backtracking or not. Not all debts are sustainable, as Greece would demonstrate soon enough. Whether or not this was so would have to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Saying that restructuring was ruled out made no more sense than saying it was automatically ruled in. By now attempting to reinstate the taboo, European leaders only highlighted their own inconsistency and how out of touch they were with reality. These missteps had a series of further implications, none of them pretty. First, Europe took a hard right turn from fiscal stimulus to austerity even earlier than the United States—even before the Obama stimulus wound down in 2012 and the Sequester commenced in 2013. If debts were not going to be restructured, then they would have to be repaid. And they could be repaid only through some combination of tax increases and public spending reductions. The Greek case, ignoring its special nature—for ignore it is what officials did—lent salience to the idea. In lavishing fourteen monthly salaries on public servants (not just the Christmas bonus but yet another bonus month of pay), Athens was spending too much. By allowing physicians to report taxable incomes that were sometimes as little as €1,000 a month, it failed to crack down on tax cheats or make a credible effort to fund public programs. Some increase in taxes and reduction in public spending were clearly required, although whether austerity on the scale prescribed by the Troika was called for was another matter.

Other countries running budget deficits were now seen as requiring a dose of the same medicine, especially once they lost market access in the wake of Deauville. It mattered little that their problems were not at all like those of Greece. It made no difference that their budget deficits were largely a consequence of the crisis; Spain and Ireland, for example, were running surpluses until 2008. But if governments were unable to borrow and if the ECB, the one entity in a position to do so, was unwilling to lend, then they had no choice but to cut. The Hellenic motif inspired the belief that Southern European governments were profligate. It played into the German presumption that, whatever the circumstances, belt tightening was appropriate. Keynesian doctrine, whether at the level of formal theory or simply FDR’s instinctual understanding that government must “spend money when no one else had money left to spend,” never gained traction in Germany. Deficit spending in the 1920s was synonymous with inflation. The country’s one real experience with anything resembling Keynesian fiscal policy, in the 1930s, had associations with rearmament, Hitler, and worse. And if German taxpayers understood one thing, they understood that the alternative to budget cuts was more emergency finance, of which they would be asked to provide the largest part.

Hence the shift to austerity, driven by a combination of political self-interest and deep-seated ideology, was general. Tax increases and spending cuts drained nearly 1½ percent of GDP’s worth of net public spending from the Eurozone economy in 2011 and another 2 percent in 2012. Olli Rehn, EU commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, spoke in hopeful Orszag-like tones of how budget cuts would “restore confidence” and boost investment, but there was no increase in investment.2

Others referred wistfully to how the capacity freed up by the reduction in domestic spending might be redeployed toward exports. But this failed to take into account the fact that the cuts in spending were Eurozone wide. With even Germany in austerity mode, there was nowhere for additional Spanish and Italian exports to go. It did not reckon with the lethargic growth of the advanced-country world in the wake of the financial crisis. And it did not take into account the strength of the euro, reflecting the ECB’s reluctance to cut interest rates and expand its balance sheet as aggressively as the Fed.

Work by the IMF’s Olivier Blanchard, cited above, implied that these public spending cuts chopped as much as 2 percentage points off Eurozone growth in 2011 and 3 percentage points in 2012.3 Thus, the slowdown from 2.0 percent in 2010 to 1.5 percent in 2011 and −0.6 per cent in 2012 was entirely man-made. Specifically it was made in Brussels, home of the Commis­ sion, and in Europe’s national capitals. Europe, unlike the United States, had essentially avoided a double-dip recession in 1937–38. After three years of sharp decline between 1929 and 1932, industrial production began to recover, as we have seen, rising by 1935 to within 10 percent of the previous peak. This time the initial decline lasted only one year and the recovery in 2010 was sharp. But then, with the turn to austerity, industrial production started back down. By 2013 it was more than 10 percent below the 2008 peak. In other words, Europe was doing even worse than in the Great Depression.

The consequences were ironic, for those able to see irony through their tears. There was the irony of the IMF, not normally an advocate of deficit spending, recommending that European countries go slower on fiscal consolidation. There was the irony that spending cuts and tax increases did not succeed even in their immediate goal of enhancing debt sustainability. With the Eurozone continuing to contract, the debt-to-GDP ratio continued to rise, reaching 93.4 percent in the second quarter of 2013. If the objective was to restore fiscal solvency, this was not the way to go about it.

A second implication was the loss of European solidarity and damage to the European Union. For more than fifty years, the EU functioned as a trust-building mechanism. It provided a framework through which European countries could collaborate peaceably and in which Germany could flex its economic muscles without intimidating its neighbors. It was a way for the citizens of diverse countries, speaking many languages and with their own national traditions, to cultivate a common European identity. As shared money, the euro was supposed to be the capstone on this process.

As a result of how the euro crisis was handled starting in 2009, it did not turn out this way. Instead of breeding solidarity, management of the crisis by the Commission and the ECB opened up a psychic gulf between Northern and Southern Europe. The German broadsheet Bilt wrote how “proud, cheating, profligate Greeks” bent on exploiting the responsible German taxpayer should be ejected from the Eurozone. The Greek press responded with a photo montage of the Victory Column in Berlin topped by a giant swastika, and it disinterred the long-buried issue of Germany’s failure to pay post–World War II reparations.

The traditional response to such crises had always been more Europe. If a single currency and a single financial market implied the need for a single bank supervisor at the level of the European Union, then the answer was to create one. If debt problems implied the need for fiscal union, and if fiscal union in turn implied the need for political union, then the answer, again, was to move forward toward fiscal and political union. So it had been, in fits and starts, for more than fifty years. But there was now a lack of trust in the institutions and individuals charting the course. In a spring 2013 survey, conducted at the behest of the European Commission, no less, pollsters determined that fully 60 percent of respondents did not trust the EU. This was double the share in 2007.4 The change reflected a sharp increase in those with a negative image of the EU, pessimism about the future of the Union, and skepticism about the efficacy of the single currency. The arguments for complementing monetary union with banking union, fiscal union, and political union were compelling. But the disastrous way in which the crisis was handled made the goal harder to achieve.

Going backward, on the other hand—back to national currencies—promised only chaos. For one country, say Greece, to abandon the euro would immediately excite expectations about the others, causing investors to flee. Seeing depositors run on their banks, governments would be forced to respond with deposit freezes and capital controls. It seemed unlikely that the EU’s single financial market, and for that matter the EU itself, could survive these events. Going back was no solution. Europe, it seemed, was stuck. Europe’s crisis was first and foremost a banking crisis. Its banks were overleveraged, undercapitalized, and excessively exposed to the property market. Their problems had been brewing for years. But now, with some ingenuity, policy makers succeeded in transforming the banking crisis into a financial crisis, a growth crisis, and a political crisis.

Ireland is the prime case in point. If Greece was uncompetitive and deficit-prone, Ireland was the opposite. Having grown rapidly for two decades, it had shed its image as Europe’s sick man and was now the best-performing European economy. Its skilled workforce, efficient business environment, and firm-friendly corporate tax code were magnets for foreign investment. Ireland had been running budget surpluses since 2003. In 2006, shortly before the fall, the surplus reached an impressive 3 percent of GDP. National government debt declined from an already modest 34 percent of GDP in 2000 to just 25 percent in 2007.

The exception to these generalizations was the banks. Though not quite matching Iceland, Ireland had experienced an extraordinary banking and financial boom. (“What’s the difference between Iceland and Ireland?” it was subsequently asked. Answer: “One letter and six months.”) From the turn of the century, the assets of the banking sector grew at an annual average of 25 percent, five times as fast as the economy and fully twice the Euro-area average. Domestic credit to the nonfinancial private sector rose from 80 percent of GDP at the end of 2002 to nearly 180 percent in September 2008. Irish banks funded themselves abroad, attracting deposits from yield-hungry German households and large loans from foreign banks and bondholders. Foreign borrowing by the Irish banking system tripled between 2002 and 2008. Loans were nearly twice deposits on the eve of the crisis, indicating how heavily the banks relied on so-called wholesale finance. The resulting funds were then lent to property developers and homebuyers. Where mortgage and real estate loans had accounted for a bit more than a third of all bank lending in 2001, they were nearly 60 percent in 2005.

Still, the banks’ massive lending to property developers and the building boom they engendered—by 2006–07 building and construction accounted for fully 9 percent of Irish GDP, half again as much as in the United States— were not enough to dampen the rise in house prices, which quadrupled in the decade ending in 2005.5 The banks demanded little in the way of money down. Fully a third of all mortgages taken out by first-time homebuyers in 2006 had 100 percent loan-to-value ratios. The banks accommodatingly offered interest-only mortgages to help stretched homebuyers meet their monthly payments.

Still, affordability had its limits. House prices could not rise indefinitely at an annual rate of 15 percent, three times the rate of growth of incomes.6 There seems to have been awareness that the increase would slow at some point, and perhaps even go into reverse. But as in the United States, where policy makers famously predicted that the fallout from the subprime crisis would be contained, there was no premonition of the consequences. In a perfectly timed financial-sector assessment released in August 2006, an International Monetary Fund team concluded that “the financial system seems well placed to absorb the impact of a downturn in either house prices or growth more generally.”7 You can’t make this up.

There is some controversy over the extent to which neglect of these excesses reflected naïveté, as is plausibly the case of the IMF, as opposed to self-dealing by bankers and property developers. Bank managers were encouraged to borrow from their own banks, allowing not a few to acquire “sizeable property and site portfolios.”8 Banks like Anglo Irish, ultimately number one as a source of taxpayer losses, “catered for a relatively limited number of customers, many of them in the property development sector.”9 Managers granted instant credit approval to friends in the property sector; the loans in question were rubberstamped by the bank’s credit committee after the fact. Not until the late stages of the boom were the minutes of Anglo’s credit committee even taken. Many loans were backed not by cash flow or collateral but by simple personal guarantees.10 These practices were characterized, when corporate strategy was described, as “relationship banking.” Anglo’s CEO and then chairman Seán FitzPatrick proudly observed how, when “you deal with Anglo Irish Bank, you don’t deal with the bank, you deal with the individual . . . the final decision maker.”11 With hindsight, this was not a positive.

In the case of Anglo, the other main borrower was management itself. Eventually it emerged that FitzPatrick had borrowed more than €150 million from the bank, and as much as €121 million in 2007 alone, using his shares as collateral but warehousing his borrowings at the Irish Nationwide Building Society, an ostensibly unrelated institution, so as to hide them from Anglo’s auditor, Ernst & Young, and from readers of Anglo’s annual report.12 In his wisdom, FitzPatrick appears to have invested much of what he borrowed in additional Anglo stock. In 2010, in the wake of Anglo’s collapse, he declared bankruptcy. Subsequently he was arrested in connection with an investigation into “financial irregularities at a financial institution.” In addition, Anglo extended loans to the wealthy Irish businessman Sean Quinn to finance his purchases of the bank’s stock on margin. These loans grew frighteningly large when Anglo stock began falling in the wake of the Bear Stearns rescue, which dragged down Anglo shares and forced Quinn to meet margin calls.13

One can’t help but wonder where the regulators and their political masters were before the fact. The answer is not hard to find: in addition to intimate relations between bankers and property developers, there were also close connections with the politicians, perhaps inevitably in what was a small economy. On the eve of the crisis, FitzPatrick played an eight-hour round of golf with Taoiseach (Irish head of government) Brian Cowen, followed by an impromptu dinner at the golf resort’s hotel. FitzPatrick’s successor as Anglo CEO, David Drumm, was repeatedly briefed on government strategy toward the bank when the crisis broke. This banker-developer-politician nexus was a glaring exception to the Irish rule of efficient regulation and aboveboard management. It is not surprising that the turmoil following the failure of Lehman Brothers should have raised questions about the ability of Anglo, and of other Irish banks that took it as their business model, to make good on their obligations. Nor is it surprising that this realization precipitated a sharp fall in bank share prices and anxiety among depositors. What is remarkable is the alacrity with which Irish leaders, with help from Brussels and Frankfurt, transformed this simple banking crisis into a national calamity.

The agent of disaster was the bank guarantee. Ireland had already raised its deposit guarantee to €100,000, as noted earlier. An even more generous guarantee to reassure large depositors would not have been unprecedented; recall that this was when the United States was poised to raise the ceiling on deposit insurance to $250,000. But no one anticipated that Cowen would throw a blanket over all the banks’ liabilities, not just their deposits but also their wholesale borrowings from bondholders and others.

How exactly this decision emerged from Cowen’s mysterious all-night meeting on September 29 is disputed.14 In a normal bank failure, to the extent that there is such a thing, small depositors are protected. Other creditors are wiped out or, in the event that the bank has residual value, see their claims converted into equity in the surviving institution. This is the model toward which EU authorities groped somewhat ineptly when winding up Laiki Bank, the troubled Cypriot lender, in 2013. But in Ireland’s case, the bondholders, many of whom were sophisticated foreign institutional investors who presumably knew the risks they were taking, were made whole. They were made whole by the Irish taxpayer, with whom the government stuck the bill.

Since the liabilities of the Irish banking system were a multiple of national income, with even a modest loan loss rate the bill would become enormous. The politicians claimed they were misled by Anglo executives who understated how much money was needed to pay off the creditors, but they should have known better. Rather than the €7 billion of temporary assistance initially requested, Anglo ultimately required more than €30 billion, none of which was recovered. Paying off the creditors of all six Irish-owned retail banks eventually cost taxpayers €64 billion, roughly €14,000 for every Irish man, woman, and child. Whether the Irish citizenry would really be prepared to shoulder such a heavy burden in order to make the banks’ creditors whole was uncertain. That uncertainty in turn cast a long and disruptive shadow over the Irish economy.

This colossal bill started coming due in 2009 but exploded in 2010, when the deficit soared to more than 30 percent of GDP (you read that right).15 Public debt, admirably low three years earlier, now rose to 100 percent of national income. The ECB, as the price for its continued provision of liquidity, demanded that the Irish government immediately recapitalize the banks. Swift bank recapitalization has its merits, but not when doing so threatens to bankrupt the sovereign. And it was not just the bank recapitalization costs; in addition, there was the fact that the denominator of the debt/GDP started shrinking as Ireland, reeling from the end of the property boom and seeing the government slam on the fiscal brakes, became the first European country to enter recession.16 The economy contracted by an alarming 9.8 percent in 2009 and another 3.2 percent in 2010 in nominal terms, those being what are relevant for the capacity of a country to service nominally denominated debts.

Thus, what had been a banking crisis became a fiscal crisis, as investors questioned the capacity of the Irish sovereign to service its debt and worried that their bonds might be restructured. Yields shot up across Southern Europe in the wake of the Deauville declaration, but nowhere as dramatically as in Ireland. (This was when Ireland won its honorary Southern European status.) By early November 2010 the yield difference between ten-year Irish bonds and German bunds was 6.65 percent.

These were not rates the Irish sovereign could afford. And so the country was driven into the arms of the Troika. Losing its fiscal sovereignty—for that was what accepting the budgetary demands of the IMF, the Commission, and the ECB effectively entailed—was devastating for a country that had gained its independence only in 1922 at the end of a long, drawn-out bloody battle. Enda Kenny, leader of the center-right opposition Fine Gael party, accused the Cowen government of turning the Republic into a fiscal protectorate. “This is a democracy and people died on the street for it,” he railed. “It will not be closed down by incompetence.” This, of course, was much sound and fury signifying nothing. Neither Cowen nor Kenny could conjure resources out of thin air. Ireland was desperate for finance, of which the Troika was the only source. But neither the IMF nor the European Union would lend without assurances. Predictably, these took the form of the now-standard program, leavened only by a bit of additional emphasis on downsizing the banking system. As agreed in December 2010, Ireland would receive €67.5 billion, much of which would go to recapitalizing the banks, overhauling their funding structure, and defraying the costs of the National Asset Management Agency, or NAMA, the “bad bank” created to acquire troubled property development loans and sell them off for whatever they would fetch.17

Importantly, there was no effort to bail in bank creditors. The two-year blanket guarantee adopted in September 2008 had just expired when the 2010 program was finalized. It would have been possible to write down the value of senior bonds to limit the cost of repairing the banks’ balance sheets. But European officials were concerned about the stability of banks in other countries. Revisiting the Irish guarantee would have raised questions about the security of their bonds and unsettled their holders. This rendered the Troika reluctant to renegotiate. The Cowen government had made its bed and now must sleep in it.

The Kenny-led Fine Gael–Labour coalition that succeeded it following the February 2011 general election might be thought to have had other options. Almost immediately, the new finance minister, Michael Noonan, approached the Troika with a proposal to write down obligations to the senior bondholders of Anglo Irish and the Irish Nationwide Building Society. (Irish Nationwide, FitzPatrick’s consort, had been almost as enthusiastic a property lender and suffered equally catastrophic losses.) But the ECB was a full partner in the Troika, and its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, was insistent that any attempt to impose losses on bank bondholders would hit confidence and impair the ability of banks to access funding, not just in Ireland but across the Eurozone. In any case, debt to the bank bondholders was being replaced on the Irish national balance sheet by debt to the Troika. If bondholders were no longer sufficiently senior to escape losses, who was to say that the same might not also be true of official creditors? In other words, any change in the program acknowledging that the blanket bank guarantee was a bad idea might ultimately come out of the European Union’s hide and pocketbook.18 Given Ireland’s dependence on Troika funding, the new government quickly fell into line.19

Since so much of the Troika’s rescue funding went to repair the banks and pay off their creditors, the Irish government had no choice but to curtail other spending. The hope was that cuts could be limited as the economy stabilized and recovered. The delusion, which infected Dublin, Brussels, Frankfurt, and Washington alike, was that growth would resume in 2011. “After two years of sharp declines in output,” the memorandum of agreement with the European Commission and IMF read, “the Irish economy is expected to broadly stabilize this year before expanding during 2011–14.” The Troika went on to detail its logic. “As domestic imbalances from the boom years are being repaired, the recovery will, at least initially, be primarily export driven. We project that GDP growth will increase over time as export performance filters through to investment and consumption, consumer confidence returns, and labour market conditions improve.”

What did not filter through, evidently, was that with the general turn to austerity there was no one to export to. Nor did it sink in that, as a result of European policy makers’ blunders, other crisis countries saw their spreads explode, were also on the verge of losing market access, and would similarly be forced into the tender clutches of the Troika.20

It would take the better part of three years, not three months, for recovery to commence. In the meantime, unemployment soared to 15.1 percent. The residents of Ireland responded as they had to the Great Famine: by emigrating. Between 2008 and mid-2013 nearly 400,000 persons left the Republic, whether for other English-speaking economies or, in the case of recent arrivals, back to their country of origin. Many of the emigrants were the best and the brightest. The damage would not be easily undone.21 Every unhappy European country was unhappy in its own way, as noted in the introduction. Portugal, for instance, had neither the heavy public debts of Greece nor the housing and banking problems of Ireland. But its policy makers, the Social Democrats under José Manuel Barroso (who on leaving office was rewarded for his achievements with appointment as president of the European Commission) and then the Socialists under José Sócrates equally, had done little to prepare the country for the challenges of the twenty-first century. What passed for modern manufacturing, the apparel and footwear industries, had long since succumbed to pressure from China. Some Portuguese companies borrowed to expand, but the borrowers were mainly small, low-productivity firms in the service sector, which did nothing to enhance international competitiveness. Between 2000 and 2008, per capita GDP grew, cumulatively, by a dismal 5 percent. By 2010, with recession now underway, per capita income had fallen back to the levels of ten years before.

Rather than investing in skills and training, Lisbon used the saving in interest costs conferred by the euro to build motorways and roundabouts, which became impressively traffic-free with the recession. It raised taxes to make good on promises to increase pension payments to retirees. Raising taxes, on labor in particular, prevented public debt from exploding but only made modernization even more difficult for Portuguese firms.

Thus, Portugal was poorly positioned when the crisis struck. The government’s coping strategy amounted to attempting to fly under the radar. The country’s small size and absence of high-profile Greekand Irish-style problems, it hoped, would allow the markets to overlook the weaknesses. But this approach was no longer viable with investors now on high alert. The government lost market access and in the spring of 2011 was forced to negotiate a €78 billion Troika program. Spending cuts, tax increases, a freeze on civil service pay, and a deep recession followed. Unemployment rose to 18 percent, youth unemployment to twice that level.

Spain was not Portugal, as Spanish policy makers went to great lengths to remind anyone within earshot. Its big banks, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) and Grupo Santander, derived much of their income from profitable operations in Latin America. National government debt was just 36 percent of GDP.22 The country boasted a number of internationally competitive companies, from Telefonica in communications to Gamesa in wind turbines, and Inditex, which owned the Zara fashion chain and operated outlets in more than a hundred countries. Spain did not suffer a dramatic loss of export market share in the decade following the advent of the euro as big firms, in particular, boosted their productivity.23 A large domestic market meant that the country was home to multinationals like Ford and Volkswagen, which could now gear their production toward exports.

But try as they might, Spanish officials could not distract investors from a collapsing property market that threatened to produce a collapsing banking system. Most immediately threatened were the cajas, semipublic savings banks that had lent aggressively to homebuyers and real estate companies. Once upon a time, back in the 1960s, the cajas accounted for barely 10 percent of Spanish financial assets. But deregulation, combined with the belief that the authorities implicitly stood behind them, allowed them to expand their balance sheets. Now they accounted for nearly 50 percent of the financial system.

Investors understood from Ireland’s experience that the authorities could not stand by as savings banks, which constituted such a large share of the financial system, drowned in bad loans. But they understood equally that rescuing them could bankrupt the state. As is the case of all banking crises, there was deep uncertainty about the extent of the losses the banks were facing. And so long as that uncertainty lingered, it cast a shadow over the solvency of the Spanish sovereign, and by implication over the future of the euro.

Initially, the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero sought to address the problem with a series of half measures. It created a bank restructuring fund, the Fondo de Reestructuracíon Ordenada Bancaria, or FROB, to recapitalize the banks but hesitated to use it for fear of damaging the public finances. The FROB, though authorized to lend €99 billion, had disbursed only €14 billion by 2012 when the banking crisis peaked.

The government next attempted to strengthen the cajas by brokering a series of mergers, hoping that cutting excess capacity and redundant staff might strengthen their financial position. But this did nothing about the bad property loans contaminating their books other than concentrate them in a smaller number of hands. The most important merger was between heavyweight Caja Madrid and six smaller savings banks. The successor institution, Bankia, assumed the mantle of the single largest holder of real estate assets and was happily listed on the Spanish stock exchange in July 2011. Just ten months later, with Bankia swimming in bad loans, the government was forced to seize it and inject €23.5 billion of share capital, further straining the public finances.24 The interest rate on the government’s ten-year bonds jumped to 7 percent on the news, a level that was clearly unsustainable.

So began the elaborate courtship dance between the Spanish government and its Eurozone partners. The banks needed help, which the government did not obviously have the wherewithal to provide. But a Troika loan to the government to enable it to rescue the banks would only transform the banking crisis into a sovereign debt crisis, as in Ireland. In principle, the European Stability Mechanism, the EU’s rescue fund, could lend directly to the banks, in contrast to what was permissible for the IMF, which was allowed by its Articles of Agreement only to lend to governments. But if it did so the Spanish sovereign would be off the hook, and the shareholders in the ESM, starting with the German government, might end up footing the bill. There was also the desire of the new center-right government of Mariano Rajoy, in office since the end of 2011, to avoid the humiliation of an EU-IMF program. Having insisted during the campaign that Spain shared few of the problems of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal, Rajoy was understandably anxious to avoid visits by the Troika’s “Men in Black.”

The resulting compromise was purposely ambiguous. On June 9, 2012, the Eurogroup of finance ministers agreed to provide €100 billion to recapitalize the banks. The loan would be extended not to the Spanish government but to the FROB, although the government would be “responsible,” in the language of the loan agreement, if the FROB was unable to repay. This furnished a pot of funds, hopefully sufficient to meet the banks’ immediate capital needs, and just enough ambiguity about whether it was an obligation of the sovereign or the FROB to hold out hope that, in the worst case where the pot had to be emptied, the government budget might be spared. The monies in question would come entirely from the ESM, not a third from the International Monetary Fund as in the agreements with Greece, Ireland, and Portugal. Rajoy thus avoided having to submit to the embarrassment of an IMF program. The Fund’s role was limited to helping monitor banking-sector reforms, while the Commission would use its regular procedures, to which all members were subject, to ensure the government stuck to its commitments. There might be no Men in Black, but there would still be men in gray.

Notwithstanding its other ambiguities, the ESM loan at least created the certainty that there would be €100 billion to recapitalize the banks. The next task was to convince the markets that this was enough. To this end, Rajoy took a leaf from Tim Geithner’s playbook, stress-testing the principal financial institutions. As in the United States, the exercise was touted to be rigorous and apolitical. The government delegated it to outside experts from the financial consultancy Oliver Wyman. It was not entirely reassuring that this was the same consultancy that, in its “State of the Financial Industry 2007 Report,” selected Anglo Irish as the world’s best bank. Rajoy was presumably banking on the fact, as it were, that the markets had short memories. Still, this was better than having the government do the test itself.

The consultants had the same Goldilocks problem as US stress testers in 2009. The estimated capital shortfall could not be so small as to be dismissed as unrealistic, nor so alarming as to heighten fears for the solvency of the banking system and the state. Fortunately, there was a residual item called the “excess capital buffer”—essentially, an assumption about how many of their existing assets the banks would be able to sell—that could be adjusted to affect the bottom line.25 The estimated capital shortfall reported in September 2012, just under €60 billion, was midway between the much smaller figures Spanish regulators were claiming previously and the €100 billion ceiling set by the ESM loan. The precision was spurious, but the result was not wholly inconsistent with the facts. Spain’s EU partners were reassured that they were not lending into a black hole, and investors that the €100 billion credit line would be enough.

There is an obvious parallel with US experience in 1933 and 2009. All three episodes show that the line between illiquidity and insolvency is difficult to draw for a banking system, as for a government. A liquidity crisis born of panic can push a banking system with real but containable problems over the edge into insolvency. This is especially the case when information about the condition of the banks is incomplete, allowing the panic to feed on itself. Conversely, providing additional information on the condition of the banks, even if imperfect, combined with credible lender-of-last-resort facilities may be just enough to fend off the panic. It will prevent a mad scramble for the exits that does even deeper damage to the banks.

In 1933, this was the formula applied by the Bank Holiday and the Emergency Banking Act. In 2009, the combination of Treasury’s stress tests and the Fed’s standing ready to act as a lender of last resort drew a line under the acute phase of the financial crisis. Now in 2012, the Oliver Wyman report, in combination with €100 billion of ESM funds, similarly took the specter of a full-blown banking crisis off the table.26 This did not mean that the Spanish recession, much less the European recession, was over. But it bought time for policy makers to contemplate their next steps.
