title: Chapter 23 Normalization in an Abnormal Economy
---



In 1936 franklin roosevelt grew anxious about a budget deficit that had ballooned to an unprecedented $4.3 billion. With pressure from his administration, Congress agreed to raise taxes on households with incomes above $100,000 and on corporations with undistributed profits. In 2011 Barack Obama grew concerned about a budget deficit that topped $1.2 trillion for a third successive year. In response Obama negotiated an agreement with Congress to raise taxes on the 1 percent of earners with incomes above $400,000, in early 2013. The agreement also allowed earlier cuts in payroll taxes to expire, causing the rate paid by workers to jump from 4.2 to 6.2 percent and reducing take-home pay by $1,000 for a US family earning $50,000 a year. These steps were coupled with “sequestration,” under which the defense budget and nondefense discretionary spending were cut by 8.5 percent.1

Roosevelt’s tax increases were not the only, or even the most important, reason for the economic slowdown that blossomed into a recession in the final months of 1937. More important, as we saw in Chapter 18, was the failure of monetary policy makers to offset the contractionary effects. Nor were the budget measures of the Obama administration and Congress, even conjoined with the slowdown in federal spending as the 2009–2011 stimulus drew to a close, the entire explanation for the disappointing recovery from the Great Recession. Also important was the failure of the Federal Reserve to do more to offset the negative impulse and instead start talking about tightening monetary policy.

But in both cases the desire to restore normal fiscal and monetary policies before normal economic conditions had returned was heavily responsible for the disappointing state of the economy. US unemployment still 分页。。。exceeded 17 percent when World War II erupted in Europe. Without the double-dip recession of 1937–38, it would have been 5 percentage points less.2 Unemployment in 2013, at 7.4 percent, was lower, reflecting the policy initiatives taken in 2009–2011. Even so, on almost any measure the recovery continued to disappoint. Growth averaged barely 2 percent per annum between 2011 and 2013, less than half the pace of the typical post–World War II expansion. The fall in the unemployment rate was driven less by improved labor market conditions than by a falling participation rate, as discouraged workers withdrew from the labor force.

There are good reasons for recovery from a slump caused by a financial crisis to be slower than a normal recovery.3 Financial crises follow periods when households, in their exuberance, incur heavy debts. The subsequent process of deleveraging, in which those same households, now face-to-face with reality, seek to work down those debts, persists into the recovery, limiting their spending. Banks, still in the process of rebuilding their capital and repairing their balance sheets, are meanwhile limiting their lending.

But the implication is not that the disappointing recovery following the 2008–09 financial crisis was inevitable. If the private sector, intent on deleveraging, spends less, then the public sector can spend more. If commercial banks lend less, then the central bank can lend more. The author­ ities can continue until the private sector is ready to take up the slack. The presence of unemployed resources in the wake of a crisis means there is space for the economy to bounce back even more vigorously than from the typical recession.

The Roosevelt recovery illustrates the point. Between 1933 and 1937 real GDP rose at an annual average rate of more than 8 percent despite household balance sheets and the financial system being seriously impaired. This is not to suggest that the United States could have matched this impressive rate of economic growth starting in 2009. But it could have done better. FDR understood the need for additional government spending to replace the private spending that had dried up. As he put it with directness in 1936, “No one lightly lays a burden on the income of a Nation. But this vicious tightening circle of our declining national income simply had to be broken. . . . We accepted the final responsibility of Government, after all else had failed, to spend money when no one else had money left to spend.”4 At the same time, Roosevelt never entirely relinquished his preoccupation with fiscal soundness or his embrace of the analogy between the household budget and the government budget. The Federal debt-to-GDP ratio was only 40 percent in 1936, less than half the 90 percent scaled in 2010, but the size of the government and its tax take, out of which debt service had to be paid, were also less. Failing to address the problem would have jeopardized confidence, in the view of the president and advisors.

Then there were arguments for raising taxes on equity grounds.5 The rich had not suffered the same excruciating pain as the common man in the Depression. It was only just, as Roosevelt and his fellow Democrats saw it, for the wealthy to now pay their fair share to finance New Deal programs designed to right these wrongs.

Not least, there were political considerations. Roosevelt had campaigned in 1932 on a promise to balance the budget. With the approach of another election, he worried that failure to carry it out might be turned into a political liability by his opponents.6

Barack Obama, on assuming the presidency, shared all three motivations. The moral argument was that the top 1 percent had greatly increased their share of the national income in the fifteen years leading up to the Great Recession. The wealthy may have suffered capital losses in the downturn, but in the 2009–2011 recovery the incomes of the top 1 percent again grew faster than incomes overall. In the two decades ending in 2011, the real incomes of the top 1 percent rose by more than 57 percent, those of the bottom 99 percent by less than 6 percent. The top 1 percent effectively captured nearly two-thirds of all income gains.7 It was only fair and just that they should pay their commensurate share in taxes.

There was also a sense among Obama’s advisors that the budget had become a political liability. The midterm gains of the Tea Party underscored the danger. In the view of Rahm Emanuel, Obama’s chief of staff, and David Axelrod, his senior political advisor, the president had to be seen as addressing the deficit. Their position played into Obama’s own cautious fiscal instincts and his belief that government was bloated and inefficient.8 It encouraged his inclination to accept cuts in spending if the Republicans in turn agreed to increases in taxes. Unfortunately, the president did not anticipate the Republicans’ readiness to accept his offer while refusing to give anything in return, or their willingness, when push came to shove, to allow the economy to fall off the cliff.

Last, there were economic arguments. Large deficits leading to unsustainable debts could undermine business confidence. The June 2010 projection of the studiously nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showed the deficit widening after 2014 as a result of mounting entitlement spending. It showed publicly held debt as a share of GDP rising sharply. Something had to be done now to address these problems looming in the not-too-distant future. Or so it was argued by the Concord Coalition, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and the Fiscal Times, all founded by Peter G. Peterson, commerce secretary under Richard Nixon, onetime head of Lehman Brothers, and co-founder of the Blackstone private equity group. A durable solution to these problems required bipartisan support. And getting Republican agreement on a medium-term plan, the president’s political advisors argued, would entail addressing the opposition’s concerns over the immediate deficit.

But abdicating government’s responsibility to “spend money when no one else had money left to spend” risked aborting the recovery and plunging the economy back into recession. Here, however, the possibility of health care and entitlement reform held out hope of squaring the circle. Less public spending and smaller deficits starting in, say, 2014 would mean less government borrowing and lower interest rates at that future date. And downward pressure on interest rates in the future would put downward pressure on interest rates now, insofar as investors look forward. Investors anticipating higher treasury bond prices would start buying today, reducing current yields. Hence any negative impact on the recovery from current spending cuts would be offset, in part, by the positive impact of future spending cuts operating through lower interest rates.

This mechanism was a key factor back in the recovery from the 1991–92 recession. President Clinton’s 1993 conversion to fiscal consolidation under the tutelage of his National Economic Council director Robert Rubin unleashed just such a low-interest-rate-led recovery. Consolidation that put downward pressure on interest rates helped to stimulate investment and growth. The Clinton administration alumni who now populated the Obama White House looked back nostalgically on this episode.

The flaw in their logic, it should have been clear, was that interest rates had already been pushed as low as they could go. The recession associated with the 2008–09 crisis was fundamentally different from the recession from which the United States recovered in 1993. The economy had now fallen into a liquidity trap. Interest rates couldn’t be depressed further by promises of lower deficits down the road. Even if coupled with a credible commitment to future deficit reduction, deficit reduction now could only hinder recovery.9

With hindsight, this fly in the ointment is blindingly clear. The question is why it wasn’t discerned at the time. As early as the beginning of 2009—indeed, even while the design of the fiscal stimulus to counter the Great Recession was still being discussed—influential voices within the administration were urging the new president to signal his commitment to closing the deficit. Already during the transition, Treasury Secretary–designate Geithner advocated putting in place plans for reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP by the end of the president’s first term, 3 percent being the talismanic threshold for fiscal prudence that the Europeans, in their wisdom, had enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty establishing their economic and monetary union.

But as Geithner grew preoccupied by the banks and their stress tests, the role of fiscal consolidator in chief was assumed by Peter Orszag, the Princeton and London School of Economics–educated economist who had worked with Rubin as an aide in the Clinton White House. In a 2004 paper, Orszag and Rubin, together with the economist Allen Sinai, argued that the adverse impact of budget deficits, and by implication the benefits of future fiscal consolidation, operate mainly through their impact on confidence. In other words, even in an environment of near-zero interest rates, where the promise of future budget cuts could not push rates down still further, there could nevertheless be a positive effect on business investment, as in the Clinton years, insofar as investors were rendered more confident and secure. Orszag, Rubin, and Sinai were writing before the environment of near-zero interest rates materialized, but the implication is clear. “Under the conventional view,” they wrote, ongoing budget deficits decrease national saving, which reduces domestic investment and increases borrowing from abroad. Interest rates play a key role in how the economy adjusts. The reduction in national saving raises domestic interest rates, which dampens investment and attracts capital from abroad. . . . The adverse consequences of sustained budget deficits may well be far larger and occur more suddenly than traditional analysis suggests, however. Substantial deficits projected far into the future can cause a fundamental shift in market expectations and a related loss of confidence both at home and abroad. The unfavorable dynamic effects that could ensue are largely if not entirely excluded from the conventional analysis of budget deficits.10 From his perch at the White House Office of Management and Budget, Orszag now argued that just such a confidence effect was needed to spur investment. The way to secure it was by making a down payment on fiscal consolidation, starting by asking every department to cut $100 million from its operating budget.

This faith in elusive confidence effects would have resonated with Henry Morgenthau, but it was not universally shared by President Obama’s economic advisors. In particular, it was not shared by Lawrence Summers, head of Obama’s National Economic Council, or Christina Romer, chair of his Council of Economic Advisors. Summers emphasized that investment and growth depended not just on confidence about the future but on conditions now. Romer warned against precipitous fiscal consolidation like what had helped to trigger the recession of 1937–38.11

But Orszag’s nonpartisan, dispassionate, Rubinesque analysis appealed to Obama, who in May 2009 tasked him with drafting a memo laying out medium-term fiscal options. None of those options was implemented immediately, but the OMB director’s advocacy of medium-term consolidation posed an obstacle to a second stimulus when it became evident in the course of the year that unemployment was rising faster than anticipated. And Orszag’s emphasis on medium-term consolidation helped lay the groundwork for the ill-fated negotiations between the White House and congressional leadership to narrow the budget deficit in 2011.

Emanuel and Axelrod were similarly concerned already in the spring of 2009 that deficits were a political liability. Their concern deepened in the fall when the Democrats lost control of statehouses in New Jersey and Virginia. Evidently, the Republicans’ anti-big-government rhetoric was resonating with independent voters. There was a backlash against the government’s anti-crisis measures, including the stimulus, fed by the observation that financial interests were not being made to pay. The banks had been bailed out. Bonuses continued to be paid, and there were as yet few instances of legal action against the miscreants.

Then there was the failure of the stimulus to deliver everything promised. The main reason unemployment rose significantly above the 8 percent peak projected by Romer and Jared Bernstein may have been that the economy was already contracting faster than anyone appreciated in 2008 and not that the stimulus itself was ineffectual, but this distinction was difficult for noneconomists to understand and for economists to explain. As unemployment rose higher than Obama’s advisors predicted would happen in the absence of the stimulus, the critics could contend that deficit spending was not just ineffectual but counterproductive. This argument may have been bad economics, but it was good politics.

In addition, by 2010 there were signs that the economy was beginning to improve. Although unemployment remained high, in excess of 9 percent, GDP at least was growing. It rose by 3.9 percent in the first quarter, not atypically for the expansion phase of the cycle, making it seem as though the shift to fiscal consolidation could safely proceed. Admittedly, conditions were worsening in Europe, which had done less than the United States to address its banking-sector problems and where the new Greek government of George Papandreou had just revealed that the fiscal and financial situation was even worse than acknowledged previously.12 But the fact that Greece’s structural and political problems manifested themselves in a gaping, previously undisclosed budget hole only strengthened the presumption that the real and present danger was fiscal profligacy. When European and American officials assembled for their summit in Iqaluit in early 2010, their interests in fiscal consolidation were aligned.

Finally, one cannot entirely dismiss the argument that President Obama’s inexperience as a tactician hastened the shift to austerity.13 Obama assumed that he and House leadership could reach an accommodation in which his offer of modest budget cuts would be met with Republican agreement to modest tax increases. On that basis the two sides could then craft a medium-term fiscal plan. But this approach did not figure with the rise of the Tea Party or a Republican leader, John Boehner, who felt obliged to cater to his caucus. In the negotiations in the winter and early spring of 2011 over the continuing resolutions to keep the government operating, not only did Boehner reject all tax increases, but he brought to the table escalating demands for spending cuts, threatening to shut down the government if they were not agreed. In this way the White House permitted the House Republicans to frame the debate as the amount by which spending would be cut.

The capstone was the budget proposal issued in April 2011 by Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee. A former speechwriter for Congressman Jack Kemp, Ryan now set out to make his name as the House’s preeminent budget specialist. His budget, entitled “The Path to Prosperity,” foresaw an additional $6.2 trillion of spending cuts over ten years. The nature of those cuts was largely unspecified, and what was specified reduced the federal budget largely by shifting Medicare expenditures onto individuals and the states, an idea that was a nonstarter politically. But this did not prevent Ryan’s budget from defining the political contest as who could cut the most. The stage was thus set for negotiations in the summer of 2011 over the debt ceiling, the cap on the value of the bonds that the Treasury was permitted to issue. In practice, raising the debt ceiling simply authorized Treasury to pay bills that the government had already incurred. But it provided another pressure point for Republican negotiators. Not raising the ceiling would force the government to default on some of its obligations. Treasury would have to decide whom to pay and whom not to pay. It might choose to pay bondholders in preference to, say, government contractors. But doing so was unlikely to reassure even the bondholders. If there was a context in which Orszag-like arguments about the importance of confidence mattered, this was it. Members of the Tea Party, for their part, were more than happy to force a technical default. Default was a guaranteed way of shrinking public spending, and for the Tea Party this was the only thing that mattered, which gave the Republican leadership additional bargaining leverage. The Republican position was that any increase in the debt ceiling had to be matched dollar for dollar with future spending cuts.

Over a barrel, the White House capitulated. Its capitulation took the form of an agreement, engineered by House and Senate leadership, to cut spending by $1.2 trillion over ten years.14 It agreed to the creation of a “supercommittee,” formally the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, comprising twelve members of Congress, to propose a further $1.2 trillion of cuts for approval by the full House and Senate. If the supercommittee was unable to reach an agreement by the end of November, across-the-board cuts, exempting only entitlements and military salaries, would kick in starting in 2013.

The idea was to make the cuts so painful and inefficient that there would be irresistible pressure for the supercommittee to agree. But the irresistible turned out to be resistible. Threatening to play Russian roulette with the economy was ineffectual, given a populist wing of the Republican Party more than willing to gamble on an empty chamber. It is not entirely surprising that a committee whose members ranged from Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, a close ally of House Majority leader Nancy Pelosi and steadfast supporter of social programs, to Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, a former currency swap trader for Morgan, Grenfell & Co., Tea Party spokesman and staunch opponent of raising the debt ceiling, was unable to agree. And so the Sequester, which cut discretionary civilian spending and the military budget alike by 8.5 percent, came into effect starting on March 1, 2013.

This is not to say that the White House, like the Bourbons, learned nothing. At the end of 2012, when the Bush tax cuts were slated to expire, it drew a line when it came to extending them for the top 1 percent of income earners. At the same time, however, it acquiesced to the call for higher payroll taxes from those concerned for the longer-term solvency of the Social Security system.

The structural budget deficit (the deficit with the impact of the business cycle removed) narrowed by 1¾ percent of GDP in 2012 as the stimulus wound down, and then by 2½ percent of GDP in 2013 as a result of tax increases and the Sequester. The International Monetary Fund, not normally an advocate of public spending, criticized the pace of deficit reduction as excessive and warned that it was subtracting between 1⅓ and 1¾ percentage points from US growth in 2013.15 If recovery from the financial crisis continued to disappoint, this was not because disappointing recovery was inevitable. At least this is the conclusion if one believes that dysfunctional politics and policies are not the inevitable result of financial crises. Ordinarily, one might have expected the Fed, aware of the increasingly contractionary stance of fiscal policy, to take steps to offset or dampen the effects. The Federal Reserve Board was certainly aware of the problem, having highlighted it in the 2013 “Report on Monetary Policy” transmitted to Congress in July.16

But the circumstances in 2013 were not ordinary. The federal funds rate, having already been reduced to 0–0.25 percent, was as low as it could go. The FOMC indicated its intention of keeping it there as long as unemployment remained above 6.5 percent and inflation one to two years ahead was not seen as exceeding its 2 percent target by more than half a percentage point. The FOMC also continued its program of large-scale asset purchases, buying mortgage-backed securities at a rate of $40 billion a month and long-term treasuries at $45 billion a month. In addition, it was reinvesting the principal payments on maturing mortgage-backed securities and rolling over maturing treasuries. It signaled that it would continue these policies until the labor market outlook improved. The Fed was already doing a lot. Indeed, it faced criticism from conservative circles for doing too much.

Still, the central bank could have done more. It could have ramped up its purchases of mortgaged-backed securities and treasury bonds. It could have widened the tolerance band around its 2 percent inflation target from half a percentage point. It could have raised the target itself. Doing so would have been a departure from monetary convention, but there was an argument for unconventional action when unemployment was stubbornly high, growth continued to disappoint, and fiscal consolidation placed sharp contractionary pressure on the economy. Larger securities purchases or a 3 percent inflation target were not as radical as Roosevelt’s decision to abandon the gold standard and engage in large-scale purchases of gold. Abandoning the gold standard and requiring citizens to exchange their gold for paper currency constituted a revolutionary change in the conduct of monetary policy. Additional securities purchases or even a higher inflation target would have been weak soup by comparison.

Differences in decision-making processes partly explain the contrasting outcomes. In 1933 the decision to suspend the gold standard could be taken by one man, the president, by executive order, since his party controlled both houses of Congress, which were prepared to validate his order. FDR could act decisively. Starting in October, he could use the powers of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to buy however much gold he wished, consulting only his trusted advisors Henry Morgenthau and Jesse Jones. Morgenthau, in his wisdom, could manage the money supply as he saw fit through the Treasury’s gold sterilization program. Few in Congress complained that the Executive Branch had usurped powers that properly rested with the Federal Reserve. To the contrary, influential voices from Elmer Thomas on down pressed the president to pursue a more expansionary policy by any means necessary. The Fed’s catastrophic missteps had not exactly burnished its reputation or buttressed public and political support for its independent conduct of monetary policy. In 2013 influential voices warned that the Fed’s unconventional policies—purchases of mortgage-backed securities designed to support the housing market, for example—exceeded its mandate for the preservation of price stability. These critics in turn raised questions about its independence. This episode eighty years earlier is a reminder that failing to pursue the central bank’s mandate for high employment, whether explicit or implicit, may jeopardize its independence as well.

In 2013, in contrast to 1933, monetary policy was made by committee, specifically by a committee of seven Federal Reserve governors and five Reserve bank presidents. It is the nature of committees to move slowly, something that is truer of the Federal Open Market Committee than most. The FOMC values consensus. Members may dissent, but they are aware that too many dissents raise questions about the coherence of policy. All this makes compromise the order of the day. Changes in monetary policy, for better or worse, tend to be incremental, not radical.

In the summer of 2013, those incremental changes were in the direction of less accommodation, not more. In May, in addressing Congress’ Joint Economic Committee, and then in June, in a post-FOMC press conference, Chairman Bernanke indicated that the central bank might start cutting back on its securities purchases and could conceivably halt them entirely by mid-2014, despite the absence of overt inflationary pressures and continued lackluster growth. Though there was as yet no actual tapering of securities purchases, the contractionary effect of the more restrictive future monetary policy signaled by his statement was felt immediately.17 Ten-year treasury yields jumped from 2.3 to 2.9 percent over the subsequent two months, pushing up the thirty-year mortgage interest rate from 4 to 4.5 per cent and slowing the recovery of the housing market.

Several factors combined to prompt this shift in the policy outlook. Observers worried that low yields on treasury bonds were encouraging investors to take on additional risk. They worried that purchases of mortgage-backed securities were fueling another round of housing market excesses. These warnings came not only from perennial critics of the central bank but also from Reserve bank presidents who, even though they had their fingers on the pulse of local housing and banking markets, were sometimes less attuned to the economywide effects of monetary policy. But even Chairman Bernanke echoed their concerns in a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago in May 2013, when he noted that the central bank was “watching particularly closely for instances of ‘reaching for yield’ [where investors moved into riskier investments in search of higher returns] and other forms of excessive risk taking.”18

There were also doubts among FOMC members about the effectiveness of monetary stimulus. Richmond Reserve bank president Jeffrey Lacker argued that an additional 50-basis-point reduction in treasury bond yields and mortgage rates would do little to encourage faster growth in an economy that was being held back by an aging population and burdensome regulation. As he put it in May 2013, although growth had resumed, “it appears as if it’s limited, in large part, by structural factors that monetary policy is not capable of offsetting. In this situation, the benefit-cost trade-off associated with further monetary stimulus does not seem promising.” The Dallas Fed’s Richard Fisher, though not a voting member of the FOMC, made up for his lack of a ballot with an abundance of metaphor, arguing that confidence was apt to be missing in the absence of a credible medium-term fiscal plan and that until then “the Fed is, at best, pushing on a string and, at worst, building up kindling for speculation and, eventually, a massive shipboard fire of inflation.”19 Their diagnoses were dubious, but their noisy dissents made it more difficult for the central bank to stay the course.

Above all, that the Fed, together with other policy makers, had averted another Great Depression discouraged it from doing more. Members of the FOMC could draw solace from the fact that the housing market was doing better. They could feel comfort that state and local government finances were improving. They could point to the fact that there had been no collapse of activity as in 1929–33. This allowed them to give a hearing to the critics of central bank activism and indulge their desire to return to a more conventional monetary policy, conventional economy or not. US policy in 2008–09 prevented the worst, as policy makers proudly noted. But that very result, ironically, now worked to shape policy in less positive directions.
