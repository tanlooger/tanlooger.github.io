title: Chapter 24 Making Things as Difficult as Possible
---



If domestic policy created headwinds for US recovery, then events else-where, in Europe, did not help. The euro crisis broke into the open in 2010 even before US fiscal and monetary policies shifted in a more austere direction. The consequences were catastrophic first and foremost for the members of the European Union. But they also weighed on the performance of other economies, including a United States still struggling to recover from the worst recession in eighty years.

The Europeans had long been working to make things as difficult as possible. They neglected the problems in their banks. They neglected the deterioration of competitiveness across Southern Europe. They neglected the chronic fiscal problems of Greece, which in their wisdom they admitted to the Eurozone in 2002.

And in creating the euro, they closed off all avenues for resolving these problems. There was no possibility of devaluing the national currency because there was no national currency to devalue. There was no scope for regaining the devaluation option, since there was no provision for exiting the Eurozone. There was no banking union to accompany the monetary union. In the absence of a single bank supervisor and a mechanism for winding up bad banks, there was no way of forcing national regulators to recapitalize or liquidate insolvent financial institutions. There was no procedure for restructuring the debts of troubled governments—no sovereign bankruptcy code. There was no mechanism for providing emergency assistance to governments or consensus on the design of the associated policy conditions. There was not even agreement that the European Central Bank should act as a lender of last resort, injecting credit as needed to stabilize the financial system. 分页。。。 This last fact did not prevent the ECB from actively contributing to the crisis. Oblivious to the brewing storm, it raised its main policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent in July 2008. This decision was extraordinarily destructive. The United States had been in recession since the end of 2007, and it was implausible that Europe would remain immune from the effects. Problems caused by their speculation in the US subprime market had already surfaced at IKB and BNP Paribas.1 Property prices in Ireland and Spain were already at a peak. That there would be problems for banks in these countries was predictable, even if it was not predicted by the ECB. The growth of money and credit across the Eurozone was visibly slowing. The rate of growth of the M3 money supply crested at the beginning of 2008 before heading steadily downward, heralding an impending slowdown in bank loans to the private sector and in the growth of the economy.

This was no time for monetary tightening. But there is no doubt about what motivated the ECB. Headline inflation was running at more than 3 percent, uncomfortably above the 2 percent rate ECB officials saw as the permissible ceiling. Their mistake was to focus on the headline. Inflation accelerated in the first half of 2008 owing to sharp increases in commodity and energy prices, fueled by strong demand from China and other energy-hungry, fast-growing emerging markets. But commodity and energy prices are volatile. They can come down as quickly as they go up, as they now did in response to the slowing of the world economy. In the end, core inflation—inflation cleansed of the transitory effects of volatile commodity and energy prices—never once in 2007–08 breached the ECB’s 2 percent threshold, measured monthly.

Unlike the Federal Reserve, the ECB had always looked to headline inflation. In 2005 its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, touted the importance of privileging the measure. In the United States, with its flexible, decentralized labor markets, gas prices might go up or down without much of an impact on wage settlements. But in Europe, Trichet explained, higher food and fuel prices were passed through quickly into higher wages in the annual bargaining round, given countries’ strong, centralized unions. This made headline inflation the relevant measure for forecasting future price pressures. “Measures of ‘core’ inflation have, at least in the past, been shown to lag behind, rather than lead, the developments in headline inflation,” as Trichet put it in his 2005 remarks. “It would appear inappropriate to exclude energy from the price index,” he concluded, “and at the same time retain other items. . . .”2

However plausible this argument was in 2005, it was no longer so in 2008. Growth was slowing. Unemployment was poised to head higher. The idea that there was about to be an explosion of wage demands was incredible under the circumstances. If the distinction between headline and core inflation was too subtle for policy makers, that was because it was too subtle for the public. The public associated the euro with increases in the cost of essentials like bread and coffee. Bakers and baristas were accused of rounding up prices in 2002 when the final changeover from the franc and lira took place. The euro, the public concluded, was an inflation-prone currency. At the very moment Trichet was making his fateful defense of headline inflation, he was being hounded by Paris Match about how Europeans “label the euro a factor of inflation after seeing the price of a loaf of bread rise from five French francs to €1, an espresso from five French francs to €1.20, or a scratch card from ten French francs to €2.” While insisting that the observation was exaggerated, Trichet nonetheless conceded that “the idea that the euro is inflationary remains rooted in the collective consciousness because, at the time of the changeover to the single currency, a very few prices increased disproportionately.”3 Given this consciousness, those very few prices were too sensitive to ignore.

In Germany, where inflation aversion ran deep, the distinction between headline and core inflation was dismissed out of hand. As the first French president of the ECB, Trichet, a career financial diplomat, was committed to establishing that he was as Teutonic monetarily as any German. His commitment extended to taking German language lessons. More substantively, it extended to embracing the concept of headline inflation and attaching priority to keeping it below 2 percent, regardless of whatever problems might be developing in the banking system or the economy.

After Lehman Brothers, the position changed. Even the ECB, notwithstanding its temperamental opposition to policy activism, felt compelled to act. That headline inflation, under pressure from the crisis, was now falling toward its 2 percent target certainly helped. The ECB Governing Council cut the bank’s key interest rate to 3.75 percent, 3.25 percent, and then 2.50 percent in October, November, and December 2008. It expanded the list of assets acceptable as collateral in credit operations. It signaled readiness to supply as much liquidity as financial institutions might require.4 To be sure, interest rates were still substantially above zero, unlike in the United States. The ECB’s initiatives were more modest than the first round of quantitative easing launched by the Fed in November. Still, this was better than nothing. But the damage done by the earlier policy action was not easily repaired. Economists are not able to estimate with precision the lags between money growth and output, but few among them question that it takes several quarters for the full effects of a monetary impulse to be felt.5 Thus, while Eurozone GDP turned only mildly negative in the second half of 2008, it then moved sharply lower, shrinking at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first half of 2009, reflecting the effects of the tightening of monetary conditions a year earlier. The European recession was now underway, compounding the problems of banks, property developers, and governments, first and foremost in Europe itself but also in other countries like the United States.

With the ECB’s failure to move faster, the problem of output stabilization landed squarely in the lap of governments. If central banks weren’t going to do more, then governments were going to have to do it for them, where “it” meant fiscal stimulus à l’amérique. But stimulus in one country was no more feasible than socialism in one country. The economic effects of tax cuts would spill out to other countries, given the tendency to spend on imports as well as domestic goods. If one country went ahead with fiscal stimulus, it would bear the entire cost, in the form of heavier debts and interest payments, while reaping only a fraction of the benefits. This was a problem everywhere, but it was especially a problem in Europe, where economies were small and, as a result of European integration, highly interdependent.

Awareness of this problem in early 2009 coincided with the United Kingdom assuming the chairmanship of the Group of Twenty, leading to the decision by Gordon Brown to make a concerted fiscal response the centerpiece of the London G20 summit. Brown had made a successful political career by compensating for his lack of charisma with what even his critics acknowledged was a keen analytical mind. He was a student of history, having read the subject at Edinburgh University. He studied the ill-fated London Economic Conference of 1933 and was anxious to cement his legacy—perhaps, more accurately, to repair his legacy, following use of the UK Anti-Terrorism Act against Iceland in 2008 and the Northern Rock fiasco.

Whether owing to this historical background or for other reasons, Brown was the one national leader who clearly saw the full picture of the crisis and the need for an internationally concerted response. From this point of view, his chairmanship of the G20 in early 2009, like the presence of historically literate scholars such as Bernanke at the head of important central banks, was fortuitous. In the run-up to the April 2009 London summit, Brown barnstormed Europe, the United States, and Latin America. Over dinner at Downing Street, he reminded G20 leaders of the failure of the 1933 conference and how “that failure had foreshadowed all the other terrible events of that decade and the one to follow,” remarks presumably intended to overcome resistance to fiscal stimulus on the part of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.6

The 1933 conference had been held at the Geological Museum, where, it was said, nothing that happened disturbed the fossils; this one was held at the ExCel Center in the London Docklands, an area that had flourished as the City, London’s financial district, expanded eastward. But no more: the ExCel Center, in a sign of the times, had just been acquired by the Abu Dhabi National Exhibitions Company. Leaders assembled at this less-than-auspicious venue found it difficult to agree. Nicolas Sarkozy, like Merkel, attached higher priority to financial re-regulation and cracking down on offshore tax havens than to immediate steps to stabilize the economy. Neither the United States nor China appreciated having the Europeans, with financial problems of their own, lecturing them on regulatory reform.

In the end, leaders were able to create at least the impression of a united front. They agreed to provide additional resources to the IMF, positioning it to make larger loans to countries in need. (In time, the countries in need would turn out to be European.) They finessed the controversy over publishing a list of tax havens, as demanded by the French, by removing the item from the G20 communiqué and delegating the task to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, conveniently headquartered in Paris.

Most consequentially, leaders compiled their existing pledges to apply fiscal stimulus and added more. They promised support for the IMF and the World Bank, bringing the total to a headline-grabbing $1 trillion. Brown later referred to this as the “one-trillion-dollar plan,” claiming it was the step that decisively broke the fall of the world economy.7 Colin Bradford and Johannes Linn, writing on the first anniversary of the London summit, echoed this assessment, lauding the London G20 as “the most successful summit in history.”8

Whether future historians, benefiting from more distance, will share this favorable assessment is questionable. Fiscal stimulus in 2009 was indiscriminate: increases in government spending were initiated by countries with light debt loads and, equally, by countries lacking fiscal space that would pay a heavy price. Stimulus was undertaken by countries with their own currencies, like the UK, whose central banks could backstop the market in government bonds and keep interest rates low, and equally by countries lacking a national currency and national central bank, placing them at the tender mercies of the ECB. The largest stimulus as a share of GDP by a Eurozone country in 2009 was in Spain, a country with big banking and property-market problems coming down the pike. Before long, investors would question the ability of the Spanish sovereign to service its debts, and Madrid would come to regret its fiscal ambition. Greece did not announce a new stimulus package but saw the budget balance decline by a further 5 percent of GDP as a result of tax shortfalls and public-spending increases already in the pipeline. The situation in Portugal was similar.9 Wiser would have been for countries with fiscal space, like Germany, to do more and for others with debt problems to do less. The need for such nuance is obvious in hindsight.

But the idea that additional spending provided a way out of the crisis sat uneasily with the German public, limiting how much fiscal stimulus Merkel could push through the Bundestag. Southern European governments, on the other hand, were predisposed to spend more. They already had ambitious public-expenditure programs in place. Some like Spain were in denial about the extent of their banking and financial problems and the drain these would place on their treasuries. But in the absence of stronger coordinating mechanisms at the level of the G20 and the European Union, the path of least resistance was to take advantage of the pattern of denial—in effect, to exploit Europe’s weaknesses and not its strengths.

The result was more like the 1933 World Economic Conference than officials were prepared to acknowledge. Much as France could insist then that it had not contributed to the breakdown of the international monetary and financial system and therefore should not have to make sacrifices to contribute to its revival, Germany could insist now that it was not responsible for the 2008–09 crisis and therefore should not become more heavily indebted in order to resolve it. The result was less cooperation than met the eye. Those like Prime Minister Brown who saw the bigger picture failed to paint it in the appropriate shades of gray. It was not just officials who were in denial, of course. Investors were equally indiscriminate in allowing governments to proceed as they wished. In every Eurozone country other than Ireland and Greece, ten-year government bond yields remained lower in September 2009 than before the outbreak of the global credit crisis. And even in those two countries, they still barely topped the early2008 level fully a year and a half later. Earlier, analysts looking forward to the creation of the euro had argued that market discipline in the form of higher bond yields would prevent reckless fiscal behavior in the monetary union.10 But now, the first time since the advent of the euro that debts and deficits were about to become a serious problem, such discipline was notable by its absence. Southern European governments were allowed to careen recklessly ahead.

In particular, the markets continued to accept the fiction that sovereign debt problems were impossible in a monetary union. The creation of hard money, by removing the access of Southern European governments to the printing press, somehow eliminated the risk not just of currency devaluation but also of sovereign default, or so investors were inclined to believe. It is not as if Germany or some broader collection of Eurozone economies was about to assume responsibility for debts of the troubled countries. But it is striking, looking back, how investors remained blissfully unaware of the crisis about to engulf them.

Greece was the wake-up call. That the country had fiscal problems was not news. As recently as March 2009, the Council of the European Union had reprimanded Athens for fiscal slippage. It warned that the government, having recorded a deficit for 2008 in excess of the permissible 3 percent ceiling, and with a deficit target of 3.7 percent of GDP for 2009, was in violation of the Stability and Growth Pact, the EU’s fiscal surveillance mechanism. Greece was at risk of being subjected to the Union’s Excessive Deficit Procedure and to humiliating oversight by the European Commission.

The fantasy, of course, was that the deficit was just 3.7 percent. The Greek government’s accounting arm, the Hellenic Statistical Authority or ELSTAT, had long since been cooking the books. Already in 2004 the European Union’s statistical agency, Eurostat, voiced reservations about the quality of the Greek figures. From there the situation only deteriorated further. 2009 being an election year, the parliamentarians, taking full advantage of the low interest rates on offer as a result of the euro, were showering fiscal favors on their constituents in furious competition for votes.

The election in October was a victory for the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK), bringing the government of George Papandreou to power. Papandreou was the scion of the Greek equivalent of the Kennedy clan of American politicians. His paternal grandfather was prime minister on three separate occasions. His father, Andreas, founded PASOK following the restoration of democracy in 1974. It might seem as if Greece was in comfortable hands.

But Papandreou was an awkward figure to lead the country at this difficult juncture. He was born not in Greece but in St. Paul, Minnesota, where his father was a university professor of economics, and spent his formative years in Berkeley, California, where Andreas served as chair of the department. The son spoke English like a native but Greek like a foreigner, which did not impress the men in the tavernas. It didn’t help that, having received bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Amherst College and the London School of Economics and worked as a researcher, Papandreou projected a clinical air that reminded observers less of a Kennedy than, say, a Jimmy Carter. (The difference was that Papandreou’s degree was in sociology, not nuclear engineering.) Papandreou adopted a nontraditional approach to public service, notably a US-style commitment to affirmative action and a rather non-Greek—some would say non-PASOK—belief in rooting out corruption and financial excesses. His main strengths as a politician were a pleasant demeanor and easygoing nature. Decisiveness and the ability to take hard decisions were not his forte. In September 2009, in advance of the October elections, both Papandreou and his leading rival, Prime Minister Kostas Karamanlis, were visited by Bank of Greece Governor George Provopoulos. Provopoulos warned the politicians that the bank’s cash-based fiscal data indicated that the budget deficit was in fact running at a rate of 1 percentage point of GDP per month, or more than 12 percent on an annual basis. Immediately after the elections, Governor Provopoulos then met with both Papandreou and his newly appointed finance minister, the LSE-trained economist George Papaconstantinou, and warned them that the bank’s data, which tracked transfers to and from the government’s accounts, showed that the deficit for the first nine months was already 10 percentage points of GDP. The implication was that the deficit might amount to a staggering 13 percent of GDP for the calendar year. The following day Provopoulos met again with Papaconstantinou in an effort to underscore the urgency of the situation. The previous government may have been responsible for this unprecedented pre-election spending binge, but it was not as if the new government was not warned.

Had he been more decisive, Papandreou could have acknowledged the problem on assuming the prime minister’s office in October. He could have blamed it on the earlier conservative government of Karamanlis and positioned himself as a new broom. But there was a reluctance to come clean and a temptation, in the tradition of earlier Greek governments, to deny reality. PASOK had made its electoral promises, and there was pressure now to keep them. It would have taken an unusually strong-willed and decisive prime minister to tell his constituents that, circumstances having changed, it was not in their interest that those campaign promises now be kept. Papandreou, alas, was not that kind of leader. In temperament and intellect he was not unlike Édouard Herriot, who had been confronted with a similar fiscal deception, initiated by the previous French government, on taking office in 1924. Like Herriot before him, Papandreou hesitated to disown the policy—with what proved to be disastrous consequences.

Thus, the PASOK-led government’s fiscal adjustments were consistently too little, too late. Every week saw a new announcement from ELSTAT, as it dug deeper into the books of state hospitals and the like and discovered that the deficit was even larger than previously feared. Starting in early October it acknowledged that the deficit was actually 7.8 percent of GDP, more than twice the 3.7 percent previously announced. In successive revisions it then raised the deficit ratio to 9.8 percent, 11 percent, and finally 12.7 percent of national income, arriving at almost exactly the figure to which the central bank’s cash-based accounting had pointed months earlier. Every announcement was then met by a statement from Papandreou about how the government proposed to respond to the news. Every response was too little to address the underlying problem, much less get ahead of it.

Investors drew the obvious conclusion. Adding ELSTAT’s new estimates of the deficit to previous figures on accumulated government debt, they could see that the debt was actually more than 110 percent of GDP. All of a sudden the inconceivable—that a Eurozone country could default—was conceivable.11 Fitch downgraded the Greek government to BBB+ in early December. That the government had previously enjoyed an AAA rating and that it took until December for this adjustment to be made says something about how closely these supposed private-sector experts were paying attention.

In response, yields on ten-year bonds jumped from 4.99 to 5.3 percent. Papandreou and his cabinet insisted that the situation was in hand. “We will reduce the deficit, we will control the debt, and there will be no need for a bailout,” Finance Minister Papaconstantinou insisted. “We are not Iceland,” he asserted in the first of a series of ignominious country comparisons that would soon come to characterize the crisis.12

On Christmas Eve, the Hellenic Parliament passed a so-called austerity budget. In a bow to strong unions with ties to PASOK, this did not provide for cuts in public sector wages. The new budget promised only to bring the deficit down to 9.4 percent of GDP. This was still more than three times the level that the EU, and now suddenly attentive investors, regarded as prudent. And just how Mr. Papaconstantinou proposed to fund the difference was unclear.

At this point, the European Commission belatedly swung into action. Shortly into the New Year it issued a report on Greek government deficit and debt statistics indicating that it was shocked to find out that there had been misreporting going on in here. It conceded that Greece would need a bridge loan, given the obstacles to closing the deficit at even the rate proposed by the government in December. This pointed in turn to the question of who would cough up the funds. Would countries like Germany, with deep pockets, step up, or should the Greeks, having made their bed, be forced to sleep in it and impose losses on their creditors? This issue of who would bail out Greece, and eventually other crisis countries, would come to exert an increasingly corrosive influence on European politics. The bad smell would linger for years.

The hesitancy of the lenders reflected doubts, not entirely without foundation, about the reformist intentions of the Greek government. Necessarily, loans would come with conditions. “No guarantees without control” was how Merkel charmingly put it.13 Less straightforward was who would be in charge of setting the conditions and exerting the control. The European Commission, on which each country had its anointed commissioner, was not above politics. Creditor-country governments could hardly be asked to assume this sensitive political function. Germany had occupied Greece during World War II, and the application of policy conditionality by Berlin would inevitably be characterized as another German invasion. In early 2010 there were not yet posters in Athens of Merkel in a storm trooper’s uniform. These would come. And so the Europeans swallowed their pride and called in the IMF. The Fund had experience in negotiating loan conditions. Its man in Athens, Poul Thomsen, had done similar work elsewhere in the region.14 The IMF had an ambitious managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, preparing to run for the French presidency and anxious to be seen as helping his fellow Europeans. Not least, the organization’s coffers had just been topped up by the G20, conveniently for the budget-conscious Europeans.

Thus the decision was taken in March to outsource negotiation of the conditions to the IMF. At least this was the appearance. The reality was different, since the Europeans didn’t hesitate to object to conditions they didn’t like and Strauss-Kahn was anxious to please them. The IMF would finance a third of the bailout. The other two-thirds would be provided by a newly established EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility. (Subsequently, this would be renamed the European Stability Mechanism, or ESM.) Member states would contribute to the facility as a function of their size and strength, meaning Germany would contribute the lion’s share. Greece’s compliance with the terms of the agreement would be monitored by the IMF, the European Commission, and the European Central Bank, known collectively as the Troika.

The first Troika mission landed in Athens on April 21. Ten-year bond yields continued to rise as investors now openly questioned the government’s ability to service its debts. Debt in the amount of €9 billion was set to mature on May 9, and there were doubts about whether Athens could market the bonds needed to replace them. If it failed, the government would run short of cash, something the Bank of Greece, as a member in good standing of the European System of Central Banks, no longer had the capacity to print. The authorities might have to stop servicing the debt. The bond market would collapse. The whole thing, as Mr. Papaconstantinou neatly put it, “could blow up in our face.”15

If so, the consequences would not be limited to Greece. Someone, after all, had lent it all that money. In particular, German banks, led by the troubled Commerzbank, held some €17 billion of Greek debt.16 The exposure of the German private sector, including pension funds, insurance companies, and thrifty burghers searching for yield, came to as much as €25 billion, a considerable fraction of what the Greek government owed.17 What was at stake, in other words, was not just the solvency of the Greek government but the stability of the German financial system.

May 9, when the €9 billion of Greek bonds matured, was also the date of Germany’s regional elections. Knowing how her bread was buttered, it took Chancellor Merkel just days to pledge support for a Greek aid package, subject as always to the caveat that “appropriate conditions are met.” Those conditions, extending beyond fiscal policy to encompass “labor market reforms, product market reforms, financial sector reforms, [and] statistics,” were set out in a report by the Troika. The Eurogroup of finance ministers pitched in, helping to assemble a joint euro area/IMF financing package of €110 billion, with a €20 billion first installment set for disbursal in May.

This was extraordinarily fast action, born of a combination of self-interest and panic. It solved exactly nothing. The May 2010 agreement with the Greek government focused on reversing out pre-electoral increases in spending without dealing with the long-standing excesses of the Greek state. Additional cuts in government spending focused on public investment, excising economic muscle rather than fat. There was excessive reliance on tax increases to finance entitlements and sinecures, making life more difficult for Greek companies struggling in the face of collapsing demand.

And when it came to structural reform, the May program focused on the passage of measures as opposed to their implementation. Since the mid-1990s the Greek parliament had passed as many as five separate laws prohibiting smoking in tavernas and cafes, yet Greeks continued to smoke in such places. Measures mandating structural reform proceeded in the same spirit. By focusing on the adoption of statutes as opposed to their enforcement, the Troika only enabled the Greeks’ worst instincts. The Greek government may have done a less-than-adequate job of responding to the crisis, but it had less-than-adequate help.

Moreover, in projecting the impact of the adjustment program, the Troika neglected the fiscal multiplier. It fell to the Greeks to remind the European Commission and the IMF that, because theirs was a relatively closed economy relying minimally on imports and exports, the effects of government spending cuts on domestic producers would be unusually large. In early 2012 Provopoulos, the governor of the Greek central bank, published an article in the Financial Times emphasizing the point.18 The same implication flowed from the fact that the country lacked a national central bank capable of cutting interest rates to offset the impact on aggregate demand of cuts in public spending. Starting in 2011 the Greek authorities repeatedly warned the Troika to this effect. But the foreign authorities, confident in their views, paid these warnings no heed.

As a result, the Troika underestimated how hard Greece would be hit by the budget cuts, the loss of investor confidence, and the deteriorating external environment. The IMF’s projections forecast the Greek economy as shrinking by 4 percent in 2010 and by a further 2.6 percent in 2011 before stabilizing and resuming its growth in 2012. The actual contraction was 4.9 percent in 2010 and 7.1 percent in 2011, followed by a further 6.4 percent in 2012 and 4.2 percent in 2013. In all, the economy contracted fully three times as fast as forecast by the Troika, all but matching what the United States had achieved, as it were, in the Great Depression. Unemployment rose to a socially calamitous 27 percent, exceeding even what the United States endured in the 1930s.

Evidence that the Troika’s sour medicine wasn’t working made it correspondingly harder to marshal support in Athens for additional doses. This further weakened investor confidence, which in turn aggravated the crisis. The Troika report spoke of implementation risk, noting dispassionately how “policies supporting the arrangement are very ambitious and the associated social costs are significant.”19 It had no idea.

This catastrophe was no laughing matter. What was laughable was the Troika forecast that the debt-to-GDP ratio would crest at 150 percent before trending downward. This scenario left no room for undershooting growth targets, for slippage in raising revenues, or for delays in pension reform. The IMF, in applying its plain-vanilla debt-sustainability analysis, failed to acknowledge the depth of Greece’s problems. In its last precrisis review, it pointed to halfhearted reform and inadequate policy adjustment but projected a contraction of just 1–2 percent in 2009, owing to the global financial crisis, and then recovery starting in 2010.20

Indeed, it almost seemed as if the projections the Troika now produced for the growth of the Greek economy were less an input than an output of its debt-sustainability analysis. IMF rules permitted the institution to extend large loans only if it judged a country’s debt to be sustainable “in the medium term.”21 The figures for Greek growth were those needed for the debt to peak out at 150 percent of GDP in 2012–13, as policy makers promised. The alternative would have been debt forgiveness for Athens and a haircut for the bondholders. The slate could have been wiped clean, allowing Greece to start over.

But no one was prepared to go there. Debt restructuring could be messy and disruptive. The IMF had a long history of hesitating to recommend restructuring for crisis countries because of those uncertain implications. The Europeans were even more reluctant, since there was no uncertainty about how German and French banks holding Greek government debt would be affected. The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, was particularly adamant in opposing restructuring.22 Lagarde was aware that French banks were saddled with nearly as much Greek debt as their German competitors were.

And not just German and French banks; in addition, the ECB itself had bought more than €25 billion of Greek government bonds put up for sale by French and other commercial banks by the time the Greek program was announced, making Trichet a steadfast opponent of any debt write-down. In statement after statement, European officials asserted that restructuring was a red line that could not be crossed. On the Friday the Greek program was announced, Josef Pröll, the Austrian finance minister, was trotted out to repeat the refrain. Asked whether Greek debt should be restructured, he asserted, “Most certainty not. We are providing €100 billion in loans. Greece has to plow through.”23

Eventually, in 2012, privately held Greek government debt was written down by 75 percent, it having become evident that the earlier debt-sustainability arithmetic was chimerical. In 2013, in a melancholy reflection on the Greek program, the IMF acknowledged that “an upfront debt restructuring would have been better for Greece although this was not acceptable to the euro partners.”24 Hindsight is twenty-twenty.
