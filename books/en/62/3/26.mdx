title: 26 Are Generalizations Confined to Periods?
---




The fact that I have discussed the problem of social experiments before discussing at any length the problem of sociological laws, or theories, or hypotheses, or ‘generalizations’, does not mean that I think that observations and experiments are in some way or other logically prior to theories. On the contrary, I believe that theories are prior to observations as well as to experiments, in the sense that the latter are significant only in relation to theoretical problems. Also, we must have a question before we can hope that observation or experiment may help us in any way to provide an answer. Or to put it in terms of the method of trial and error, the trial must come before the error; and as we have seen (in section 24), the theory or hypothesis, which is always tentative, is part of the trial, while observation and experiment help us to weed out theories by showing where they err. I do not believe, therefore, in the ‘method of generalization’, that is to say, in the view that science begins with observations from which it derives its theories by some process of generalization or induction. I believe, rather, that the function of observation and experiment is the more modest one of helping us to test our theories and to eliminate those which do not stand up to tests; even though it must be admitted that this process of weeding out not only checks theoretical speculation, but also stimulates it to try again—and often to err again, and to be refuted again, by new observations and experiments.

In this section, I shall criticize the historicist contention (see section 1) that in the social sciences the validity of all generalizations, or at least of the most important ones, is confined to the concrete historical period in which the relevant observations were made. I shall criticize this contention without first discussing the question whether or not the so-called ‘method of generalization’ is defensible, in spite of my conviction that it is not; for I think that the historicist contention can be refuted without showing that this method is invalid. The discussion of my views on this method, and on the relations between theory and experiment in general, can therefore be postponed. It will be taken up again in section 28.

I begin my criticism of the historicist contention with the admission that most people living in a certain historical period will incline to the erroneous belief that the regularities which they observe around them are universal laws of social life, holding good for all societies. Indeed, we sometimes only notice that we are cherishing such beliefs when, in a foreign country, we find that our habits regarding food, our greeting-taboos, etc., are by no means as acceptable as we naively assumed. It is a rather obvious inference that many of our other generalizations, whether consciously held or not, may be of the same kind, though they may remain unchallenged because we cannot travel into another historical period. (This inference was drawn, for example, by Hesiod.48) In other words, it must be admitted that there may be many regularities in our social life which are characteristic of our particular period only, and that we are inclined to overlook this limitation. So that (especially in a time of rapid social change) we may learn to our sorrow that we have relied on laws that have lost their validity.49

If the historicist’s contentions went no further than this, we could only accuse him of labouring a rather trivial point. But unfortunately, he asserts more. He insists that the situation creates difficulties which do not occur in the natural sciences; and more particularly that, in contrast to the natural sciences, in the social sciences we must never assume that we have discovered a truly universal law, since we can never know whether it always held good in the past (for our records may be insufficient), or whether it will always hold good in the future.

In opposition to such claims, I do not admit that the situation described is in any way peculiar to the social sciences, or that it creates any particular difficulties. On the contrary, it is obvious that a change in our physical environment may give rise to experiences which are quite analogous to those which arise from a change in our social or historical environment. Can there be a more obvious and proverbial regularity than the succession of day and night? Yet, it breaks down if we cross the polar circle. It is perhaps a little difficult to compare physical with social experiences, but I think that such a breakdown may be quite as startling as any that might occur in the social realm. To take another example, the historical or social environments of Crete in 1900 and of Crete three thousand years ago can hardly be said to differ more than the geographical or physical environments of Crete and of Greenland. A sudden unprepared removal from one physical environment into the other would, I think, be more likely to produce fatal results than a corresponding change in the social environment.

It seems clear to me that the historicist overrates the significance of the somewhat spectacular differences between various historical periods, and that he underrates the possibilities of scientific ingenuity. It is true that the laws discovered by Kepler are valid only for planetary systems, but their validity is not confined to the Solar system in which Kepler lived, and which he observed.50 Newton did not have to withdraw into a part of the universe where he could observe moving bodies that were free from the influence of gravitational and other forces in order to see the importance of the law of inertia. On the other hand, this law, even though no body in this system moves in accordance with it, does not lose its significance within the Solar system. Similarly, there seems no reason why we should be unable to frame sociological theories which are important for all social periods. The spectacular differences between these periods are no indication that such laws cannot be found, any more than the spectacular differences between Greenland and Crete can prove that there are no physical laws which hold for both regions. On the contrary, these differences seem to be, in some cases at least, of a comparatively superficial character (such as are differences in habits, in greeting, ritual, etc.), and more or less the same seems to hold good of those regularities which are said to be characteristic of a certain historical period or of a certain society (and which are now called principia media by some sociologists).51

To this, the historicist may reply that the differences in social environment are more fundamental than the differences in physical environment; for if society changes, man changes too; and this implies a change in all regularities, since all social regularities depend on the nature of man, the atom of society. Our answer is that physical atoms also change with their environment (for example, under the influence of electro-magnetic fields, etc.), not in defiance of the laws of physics, but in accordance with these laws. Besides, the significance of the alleged changes of human nature is dubious, and very hard to assess.

We now turn to the historicist contention that in the social sciences we must never assume mat we have discovered a truly universal law since we cannot be sure whether its validity extends beyond the periods in which we have observed it to hold. This may be admitted, but only in so far as it applies to the natural sciences as well. In the natural sciences, it is clear, we can never be quite certain whether our laws are really universally valid, or whether they hold only in a certain period (perhaps only in the period during which the universe expands) or only in a certain region (perhaps in a region of comparatively weak gravitational fields). In spite of the impossibility of making sure of their universal validity, we do not add in our formulation of natural laws a condition saying that they are asserted only for the period for which they have been observed to hold, or perhaps only within ‘the present cosmological period’. It would not be a sign of laudable scientific caution if we were to add such a condition, but a sign that we do not understand scientific procedure.52 For it is an important postulate of scientific method that we should search for laws with an unlimited realm of validity.53 If we were to admit laws that are themselves subject to change, change could never be explained by laws. It would be the admission that change is simply miraculous. And it would be the end of scientific progress; for if unexpected observations were made, there would be no need to revise our theories: the ad hoc hypothesis that the laws have changed would ‘explain’ everything.

These arguments hold for the social sciences no less than for the natural sciences.

With this I conclude my criticism of the more fundamental among the anti-naturalistic doctrines of historicism. Before proceeding to discuss some of the less fundamental ones, I shall turn next to one of the pro-naturalistic doctrines, namely, that we should search for the laws of historical development.

1 The question is an old one. Even Plato sometimes attacks ‘pure’ research. For its defence, see T. H. Huxley, Science and Culture (1882), p. 19 f., and M. Polanyi, Economica, N.S., vol. VIII (1941), pp. 428 ff. (In addition to the books there quoted, see also Veblen, The Place of Science in Modern Civilisation, pp. 7 ff.)

2 Kant, Dreams of a Ghost Seer, part II, ch. Ill (Werke, ed. E. Cassirer, vol. II, p. 385).

3 See Economics vol. XIII (1933), p. 122.

4 For a defence of this term, see note 10 on p. 58, below.

5 Cp. F. A. von Hayek, Economica, vol. XIII (1933), p. 123. ‘… economics developed mainly as the outcome of the investigation and refutation of successive Utopian proposals … ‘

6 See M. Ginsberg, in Human Affairs (ed. by R. B. Cattell and others), p. 180. It must be admitted, however, that the success of mathematical economics shows that one social science at least has gone through its Newtonian revolution.

7 See my Logic of Scientific Discovery (1959), section 15. (Negated existential propositions.) The theory may be contrasted with J. S. Mill, Logic, Book V, ch. V, section 2.

8 See, for example, M. R. Cohen, Reason and Nature, pp. 356 ff. The examples in the text appear to refute this particular anti-naturalistic view.

9 A similar formulation of this ‘law of corruption’ is discussed by C. J. Friedrich in his very interesting and partly technological Constitutional Government and Politics (19 3 7). He says of this law that ‘all the natural sciences cannot boast of a single “hypothesis ‘of equal importance to mankind’ (p. 7). I do not doubt its importance; but I think that we may find countless laws of equal importance in the natural sciences, if only we look for them among the more platitudinous rather than among the more abstract laws. (Consider such laws as that men cannot live without food, or that vertebrates have two sexes.) Professor Fried-rich insists upon the anti-naturalist thesis that the ‘social sciences cannot benefit from applying the methods of the natural sciences to them’ (op. cit., p. 4). But he attempts, on the other hand, to base his theory of politics on a number of hypotheses of whose character the following passages (op. cit., pp. 14 ff.) may give an idea: ‘Consent and constraint are each a living force, generating power’; together, they determine ‘the intensity of a political situation’; and since ‘this intensity is determined by the absolute amount of either consent or constraint or both, it is perhaps most readily presented by the diagonal of the parallelogram of these two forces: consent and constraint. In that case its numerical value would equal the square root of the sum of the squares of the numerical values of consent and constraint’. This attempt to apply the Pythagorean theorem to a ‘parallelogram’ (we are not told why it should be rectangular) of ‘forces’ which are too vague to be measurable, seems to me an example not of anti-naturalism but of just that kind of naturalism or ‘scientism’ from which, I admit, the ‘social sciences cannot benefit’. It may be noted that these ‘hypotheses’ can hardly be expressed in technological form, while the ‘law of corruption’, for example, whose importance is very justly emphasized by Friedrich, can be so expressed.

For the historical background of the ‘scientistic’ view that the problems of political theory can be understood in terms of the ‘parallelogram of forces’, see now my book, The Open Society and Its Enemies (revised edition), note 2 to ch. 7.

10 Against the use of the term ‘social engineering’ (in the ‘piecemeal’ sense) it has been objected by Professor Hayek that the typical engineering job involves the centralization of all relevant knowledge in a single head, whereas it is typical of all truly social problems that knowledge has to be used which cannot be so centralized. (See Hayek, CoIIectivist Economic Planning, 1935, p. 210.) I admit that this fact is of fundamental importance. It can be formulated by the technological hypothesis: ‘You cannot centralize within a planning authority the knowledge relevant for such tasks as the satisfaction of personal needs, or the utilization of specialized skill and ability’. (A similar hypothesis may be proposed regarding the impossibility of centralizing initiative in connection with similar tasks.) The use of the term ‘social engineering’ may now be defended by pointing out that the engineer must use the technological knowledge embodied in these hypotheses which inform him of the limitations of his own intiative as well as of his own knowledge. See also note 43 on p. 82, below.

11 Including, if it can be obtained, knowledge concerning the limitations of knowledge, as explained in the previous note.

12 The two views—that social institutions are either ‘designed’ or that they just ‘grow’—correspond to those of the Social Contract theorists and of their critics, for example, Hume. But Hume does not give up the ‘functional’ or ‘instrumentalist’ view of social institutions, for he says that men could not do without them. This position might be elaborated into a Darwinian explanation of the instrumental character of undesigned institutions (such as language): if they have no useful function, they have no chance of surviving. According to this view, undesigned social institutions may emerge as unintended consequences of rational actions: just as a road may be formed without any intention to do so by people who find it convenient to use a track already existing (as Descartes observes). It need hardly be stressed, however, that the technological approach is quite independent of all questions of ‘origin’.

13 For the ‘functional’ approach, see B. Malinowski, for example, ‘Anthropol ogy as the Basis of Social Science’, in Human Affairs (ed. Cattell), especially pp. 206ff.and239ff.

14 This example, asserting that the efficiency of institutional ‘machines’ is limited, and that the functioning of institutions depends on their being sup plied with proper personnel, may perhaps be compared with the principles of thermodynamics, such as the law of conservation of energy (in the form in which it excludes the possibility of a perpetual motion machine). As such, it may be contrasted with other ‘scientistic’ attempts to work out an analogy between the physical concept of energy and some sociological concepts such as power; see, for example, Bertrand Russell’s Power (1938), p. 10 f., where this kind of scientistic attempt is made. I do not think that Russell’s main point— that the various ‘forms of power’, such as wealth, propagandist power, naked power, may sometimes be ‘converted’ into one another—can be expressed in technological form.

15 W. Lippmann, The Good Society (1937), ch. XI, pp. 203 ff. See also W H. Hutt, Plan for Reconstruction (1943).

16 The expression is often used by K. Mannheim in his Man and Society in an Age of Reconstruction; see his Index, and, for example, pp. 269, 295, 320, 381. This book is the most elaborate exposition of a holistic and historicist programme known to me and is therefore singled out here for criticism.

17 See Mannheim, ibid., p. 337. The passage is more fully quoted in section 23, where it is also criticized. (See note 33 on p. 73, below.)

18 ‘The Problem of Transforming Man’ is the heading of a chapter of K. Mannheim’s Man and Society. The following quotation is from that chapter, p. 199 f.

19 See I. S. Mill, Logic, Book VI, ch. X, section I.

20 Logic, Book VI, ch. X, section 8. Marx’s parallel passage (quoted above, in section 17) is taken from his preface to the first edition of Capital.

21 This remark shows that Mill’s Utilitarianism prevented him from defining ‘beneficial’ as synonymous with ‘progressive’; that is to say, in spite of his progressivism, he did not uphold a historicist moral theory (cp. section 19) such as was developed by Spencer and Engels (and nowadays by C. H. Waddington; see his Science and Ethics).

22 Mill, ibid., section 2 (italics mine).

23 See sections 15 to 1 7; see especially Engels’ Socialism, Utopian and Scientific.

24 I have discussed this at length in The Open Society and Its Enemies.

25 See, for example, K. Mannheim’s Man and Society, p. 6 (and many other places), where we are told that ‘There is no longer any choice “between planning and not planning”, but only a choice “between good planning and bad”‘; or F. Zweig, The Planning of Free Societies (1942), p. 30, who answers the question whether a planned or an unplanned society is preferable by saying that this question does not arise, since it has been solved for us by the direction of the present historical development.

26 K. Mannheim, op. cit., p. 33; the next quotations are from ibid., p. 7.

27 K. Mannheim, not unlike Comte, distinguishes three ‘levels’ in the development of thought: (1) trial and error or chance discovery, (2) invention, (3) planning (ibid., p. 150 f.). I am so far from agreeing with his doctrine that the trial and error method (1) appears to me to approach the method of science more closely than any of the other ‘levels’.—An additional reason for consider ing the holistic approach to social science as pre-scientific is that it contains an element of perfectionism. Once we realize, however, that we cannot make heaven on earth but can only improve matters a little, we also realize that we can only improve them little by little.

28 H. Gomperz, Wcltanschouungslebre, II/I (1908), p. 63, points out that a piece of the world, such as a sparrow nervously fluttering about, may be described by the following widely different propositions, each corresponding to a different aspect of it: ‘This bird is flying!’—’There goes a sparrow!’—’Look, here is an animal!’—’Something is moving here.’—’Energy is being transformed here.’—’This is not a case of perpetual motion.’—’The poor thing is frightened!’ It is clear that it can never be the task of science to attempt the completion of such a list, which is necessarily infinite.—F. A. von Hayek, in Ethics, vol. LIV (1943), note 5, sketches a criticism of holism which is very similar to the one propounded here in the text.

29 K. Mannheim describes (op. cit., p. 167) selective or abstract science as ‘a stage through which all sciences which strive for precision must pass’.

30 With the following three quotations compare Mannheim, op. cit., p. 184; see also p. 170, note, and p. 230.

31 Ibid., p. 230. The doctrine that we may obtain a kind of concrete knowledge of’reality itself is well known as a part of what can be technically described as mysticism; and so is the clamour for ‘wholes’.

32 See op. cit., for example, pp. 2 6 and 3 2. My criticism of holism does not mean that I am opposed to a plea for co-operation between the various branches of science. Especially when we are faced with a definite piecemeal problem which might be furthered by such co-operation, nobody would dream of opposing it. But this is a very different matter from the plan to grasp concrete wholes by a method of systematic synthesis, or something of the sort.

33 See op. cit., p. 337; and note 17 on p. 62, above.

34 The formula quoted is nearly identical with one by C. Schmitt.

35 Holists may hope that there is a way out of this difficulty by denying the validity of logic which, they think, has been superseded by dialectic. This way I have tried to block in “What is Dialectic?’, Mind, vol. 49 N.S., pp. 403 ff.

36 See K. Mannheim, op. cit., p. 202. It may be mentioned that a psychological holism is at present very fashionable with educational theorists.

37 The doctrine that history deals with ‘concrete individual wholes’, which may be persons or events or epochs, was propagated especially by Troeltsch. Its truth is constantly assumed by Mannheim.

38 K. Mannheim, op. cit., p. 175 f. (italics mine).

39 See, for example, Pauli’s exclusion principle.—To the social scientist, such ideas as competition or division of labour should make it abundantly clear that an ‘atomistic’ or ‘individualistic’ approach in no way prevents us from recognizing that every individual interacts with all others. (In psychology the situation is different, because atomism seems to be inapplicable there—in spite of many attempts to apply it.)

40 This was also Mill’s view when he said of social experiments that ‘we palpably never have the power of trying any. We can only watch those which nature produces,… the successions of phenomena recorded in history …’ (see Logic, Book VI, ch. VII, section 2).

41 Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Methods of Social Study (1932), pp. 221 ff., give similar examples of social experiments. They do not distinguish, however, between the two kinds of experiments which are here called ‘piecemeal’ and ‘holistic’, although their criticism of the experimental method (see p. 226, ‘intermixture of effects’) is especially cogent as a criticism of holistic experiments (which they seem to admire). Furthermore, their criticism is combined with the ‘variability argument’ which I consider to be invalid; see section 25, below.

42 A fuller analysis of the methods of modern physics on the lines here indicated may be found in my Logic of Scientific Discovery; see also ‘What is Dialectic?’, Mind, vol. 49, pp. 403 ff. See also, for example, Tinbergen, Statistical Testing of Business Cycle Theories, vol. II, p. 21: ‘The construction of a model … is … a matter of trial and error’, etc.

43 The observation that it is impossible to have the knowledge needed for planning ‘concentrated anywhere in a single head’ is due to Hayek; see Collectivist Economic Planning, p. 210. (See also note 10 on p. 58, above.)

44 One of the most crucial points in Spinoza’s political theory is the impossibility of knowing and of controlling what other people think. He defines 2018tyranny’ as the attempt to achieve the impossible, and to exercise power where it cannot be exercised. Spinoza, it must be remembered, was not exactly a liberal; he did not believe in institutional control of power, but thought that a prince has a right to exercise his powers up to their actual limit. Yet what Spinoza calls ‘tyranny’, and declares to be in conflict with reason, is treated quite innocently by holistic planners as a ‘scientific’ problem, the ‘problem of transforming men’.

45 Niels Bohr calls two approaches ‘complementary’ if they are (a) complementary in the usual sense and (b) if they are exclusive of each other in the sense that the more we make use of the one the less we can use the other. Although I refer in the text mainly to social knowledge, it may be claimed that the accumulation (and concentration) of political power is ‘complementary’ to the progress of scientific knowledge in general. For the progress of science depends on free competition of thought, hence on freedom of thought, and hence, ultimately, on political freedom.

46 R. H. Tawney, Religion and The Rise of Capitalism, ch. II, end of section ii.

47 In both cases—historical periods and geographical positions—we may find, using theories tested by experiments, that any reference to temporal or spatial locations can be replaced by some general description of certain prevailing relevant conditions, such as the state of education, or the altitude.

48 The same inference is also the basis of the so-called ‘sociology of knowledge’, criticized here on p. 143 f, and in ch. 23 of my Open Society.

49 K. Mannheim, Man and Society, p. 178, writes of ‘the layman who observes the social world intelligently’, that ‘in static periods he is unable, in any case, to distinguish between a general abstract social law and particular principles which obtain only in a certain epoch, since in periods of only slight variability, the divergences between these two types do not become clear to the observer’. Mannheim calls these particular principles which obtain only in a certain epoch ‘principia media’; see note 51 on p. 93, below. For the situation ‘in an age where the social structure is changing through and through’, see Mannheim, op.cit., p. 179f.

50 Kepler’s laws are chosen by Mill as examples of what he calls, following Bacon, ‘axiomata media’, for the reason that they are not general laws of motion but only (approximate) laws of planetary motion: see Logic, Book VI, ch. V, section 5. Analogous axiomata media of a social science would be laws which hold for all ‘social systems’ of a certain kind, rather than the more accidental regularities of a historically given period. The latter might be compared, not with Kepler’s laws, but, for example, with regularities in the order of the planets of our particular solar system.

51 K. Mannheim, op. cit., p. 177, introduces the expression ‘principia media’ with reference to Mill (who speaks of axiomata media; see the preceding note) in order to denote what I have called ‘generalizations confined to the concrete historical period in which the relevant observations were made’; see, for example, his passage (op. cit., p. 178; cp. my note 49 on p. 91 above): ‘The layman who observes the social world intelligently understands events primarily by the unconscious use of such principia media’, which are ‘… particular principles which obtain only in a certain epoch’. (Mannheim, loc. cit., defines his principia media by saying that they are ‘in the last analysis universal forces in a concrete setting as they become integrated out of the various factors at work in a given place at a given time—a particular combination of circumstances which may never be repeated’.) Mannheim states that he does not follow ‘historicism, Hegelianism, and Marxism’ in their failure to take ‘universal factors into account’ (op. cit., p. 177 f). Accordingly, his position is one of insisting on the importance of generalizations confined to concrete or individual historical periods, while admitting that we may proceed from them, by a ‘method of

abstraction’, to ‘the general principles which are contained in them’. (In opposition to this view, I do not believe that the more general theories can be obtained by abstraction from those regularities of habits, legal procedures, etc., which, according to the examples given by Mannheim on pp. 179 ff., constitute his principia media.)

52 It has often been suggested that instead of vainly attempting to follow in sociology the example of physics, and to search for universal sociological laws, it would be better to follow in physics the example of a historicist sociology, i.e. to operate with laws which are limited to historical periods. Historicists who are anxious to emphasize the unity of physics and sociology are especially inclined to think on such lines. See Neurath, Erkenntnis, vol. VI, p. 399.

53 It is the same postulate which in physics leads, for example, to the demand that the red shifts observed in distant nebulae should be explained; for without this postulate, it would be quite sufficient to assume that the laws of atomic frequencies change with the different regions of the universe, or with time. And it is the same postulate which leads the theory of relativity to express the laws of motion, such as the law of addition of velocities, etc., uniformly for high and low velocities (or for strong and weak gravitational fields), and to be dissatisfied with ad hoc assumptions for different realms of velocity (or of gravitation). For a discussion of this postulate of the ‘Invariance of Natural Laws’, and its opposition to that of the ‘Uniformity of Nature’, see my Logic of Scientific Discovery, section 79.
