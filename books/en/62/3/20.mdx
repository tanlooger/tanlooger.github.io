title: 20 The Technological Approach to Sociology
---




Although in this study my topic is historicism, a doctrine of method with which I disagree, rather than those methods which, in my opinion, have been successful, and whose further and more conscious development I recommend, it will be useful to deal briefly with the successful methods first, so as to reveal to the reader my own bias and to clarify the point of view that underlies my criticism. For convenience, I shall label these methods ‘piecemeal technology’.

The term ‘social technology’ (and even more the term ‘social engineering’4 which will be introduced in the next section) is likely to arouse suspicion, and to repel those whom it reminds of the ‘social blueprints’ of the collectivist planners, or perhaps even of the ‘technocrats’. I realize this danger, and so I have added the word ‘piecemeal’, both to off-set undesirable associations and to express my conviction that ‘piecemeal tinkering’ (as it is sometimes called), combined with critical analysis, is the main way to practical results in the social as well as in the natural sciences. The social sciences have developed very largely through the criticism of proposals for social improvements or, more precisely, through attempts to find out whether or not some particular economic or political action is likely to produce an expected, or desired, result.5 This approach, which might indeed be called the classical one, is what I have in mind when I refer to the technological approach to social science, or to ‘piecemeal social technology’.

Technological problems in the field of social science may be of a ‘private’ or of a ‘public’ character. For example, investigations into the technique of business administration, or into the effects of improved working conditions upon output, belong to the first group. Investigations into the effects of prison reform or universal health insurance, or of the stabilization of prices by means of tribunals, or of the introduction of new import duties, etc., upon, say, the equalization of incomes, belong to the second group; and so do some of the most urgent practical questions of the day, such as the possibility of controlling trade cycles; or the question whether centralized ‘planning’, in the sense of state management of production, is compatible with an effective democratic control of the administration; or the question of how to export democracy to the Middle East.

This emphasis upon the practical technological approach does not mean that any of the theoretical problems that may arise from the analysis of the practical problems should be excluded. On the contrary, it is one of my main points that the technological approach is likely to prove fruitful in giving rise to significant problems of a purely theoretical kind. But besides helping us in the fundamental task of selecting problems, the technological approach imposes a discipline on our speculative inclinations (which, especially in the field of sociology proper, are liable to lead us into the region of metaphysics); for it forces us to submit our theories to definite standards, such as standards of clarity and practical testability. My point about the technological approach might perhaps be made by saying that sociology (and perhaps even the social sciences in general) should look, not indeed for ‘its Newton or its Darwin’,6 but rather for its Galileo, or its Pasteur.

This and my previous references to an analogy between the methods of the social and the natural sciences are likely to provoke as much opposition as our choice of terms like ‘social technology’ and ‘social engineering’ (this in spite of the important qualification expressed by the word ‘piecemeal’). So I had better say that I fully appreciate the importance of the fight against a dogmatic methodological naturalism or ‘scientism’ (to use Professor Hayek’s term). Nevertheless I do not see why we should not make use of this analogy as far as it is fruitful, even though we recognize that it has been badly misused and misrepresented in certain quarters. Besides, we can hardly offer a stronger argument against these dogmatic naturalists than one that shows that some of the methods they attack are fundamentally the same as the methods used in the natural sciences.

A prima facie objection against what we call the technological approach is that it implies the adoption of an ‘activist’ attitude towards the social order (see section 1), and that it is therefore liable to prejudice us against the anti-interventionist or ‘passiv-ist’ view: the view that if we are dissatisfied with existing social or economic conditions, it is because we do not understand how they work and why active intervention could only make matters worse. Now I must admit that I am certainly out of sympathy with this ‘passivist’ view, and that I even believe that a policy of universal anti-interventionism is untenable—even on purely logical grounds, since its supporters are bound to recommend political intervention aimed at preventing intervention. Nevertheless, the technological approach as such is neutral in this matter (as indeed it ought to be), and by no means incompatible with anti-interventionism. On the contrary, I think that anti-interventionism involves a technological approach. For to assert that interventionism makes matters worse is to say that certain political actions would not have certain effects—to wit, not the desired ones; and it is one of the most characteristic tasks of any technology to point out what cannot be achieved.

It is worth while to consider this point more closely. As I have shown elsewhere,7 every natural law can be expressed by asserting that such and such a thing cannot happen; that is to say, by a sentence in the form of the proverb: ‘You can’t carry water in a sieve’. For example, the law of conservation of energy can be expressed by: ‘You cannot build a perpetual motion machine’; and that of entropy by: ‘You cannot build a machine which is a hundred per cent efficient’. This way of formulating natural laws is one which makes their technological significance obvious and it may therefore be called the ‘technological form’ of a natural law. If we now consider anti-interventionism in this light, then we see at once that it may well be expressed by sentences of the form: ‘You cannot achieve such and such results’, or perhaps, ‘You cannot achieve such and such ends without such and such concomitant effects’. But this shows that anti-interventionism can be called a typically technological doctrine.

It is not, of course, the only one in the realm of social science. On the contrary, the significance of our analysis lies in the fact that it draws attention to a really fundamental similarity between the natural and the social sciences. I have in mind the existence of sociological laws or hypotheses which are analogous to the laws or hypotheses of the natural sciences. Since the existence of such sociological laws or hypotheses (other than so-called ‘historical laws’) has often been doubted,8 I will now give a number of examples: ‘You cannot introduce agricultural tariffs and at the same time reduce the cost of living.’—’You cannot, in an industrial society, organize consumers’ pressure groups as effectively as you can organize certain producers’ pressure groups.’—’You cannot have a centrally planned society with a price system that fulfils the main functions of competitive prices.’—’You cannot have full employment without inflation.’ Another group of examples may be taken from the realm of power politics: ‘You cannot introduce a political reform without causing some repercussions which are undesirable from the point of view of the ends aimed at’ (therefore, look out for them).—’You cannot introduce a political reform without strengthening the opposing forces, to a degree roughly in ratio to the scope of the reform.’ (This may be said to be the technological corollary of ‘There are always interests connected with the status quo’.)—’You cannot make a revolution without causing a reaction.’ To these examples we may add two more, which may be called ‘Plato’s law of revolutions’ (from the eighth book of the Republic) and ‘Lord Acton’s law of corruption’, respectively: ‘You cannot make a successful revolution if the ruling class is not weakened by internal dissension or defeat in war.’—’You cannot give a man power over other men without tempting him to misuse it—a temptation which roughly increases with the amount of power wielded, and which very few are capable of resisting.’9 Nothing is here assumed about the strength of the available evidence in favour of these hypotheses whose formulations certainly leave much room for improvement. They are merely examples of the kind of statements which a piecemeal technology may attempt to discuss, and to substantiate.
