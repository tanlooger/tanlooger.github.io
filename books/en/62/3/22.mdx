title: 22 The Unholy Alliance With Utopianism
---




That there is opposition between the two methodological approaches which I have called ‘piecemeal technology’ and ‘historicism’ has been clearly recognized by Mill. ‘There are two kinds of sociological inquiry’, he wrote.19

In the first kind, the question proposed is, … for example, what would be the effect of … introducing universal suffrage, in the present condition of society? … But there is also a second inquiry … In this … the question is, not what will be the effect of a given cause in a certain state of society, but what are the causes which produce … States of Society generally?



Considering that Mill’s ‘States of Society’ correspond precisely to what we have called ‘historical periods’, it is clear that his distinction between the ‘two kinds of sociological inquiry’ corresponds to our distinction between the approach of piecemeal technology and that of historicism; and this becomes even more obvious if we follow more closely Mill’s description of the ‘second kind of sociological inquiry’ which (under the influence of Comte) he declares to be superior to the first, and which he describes as making use of what he calls ‘the historical method’.

As has been shown before (in sections 1, 17 and 18), historicism is not opposed to ‘activism’. A historicist sociology can even be interpreted as a kind of technology which may help (as Marx puts it) to ‘shorten and lessen the birth pangs’ of a new historical period. And indeed, in Mill’s description of the historical method we can find this idea formulated in a manner which is strikingly similar to that of Marx:20

The method now characterized is that by which … the laws … of social progress must be sought. By its aid we may hereafter succeed not only in looking far forward into the future history of the human race, but in determining what artificial means may be used … to accelerate the natural progress in so far as it is beneficial …21 Such practical instructions, founded on the highest branch of speculative sociology, will form the noblest and most beneficial portion of the Political Art.



As indicated by this passage, it is not so much the fact that it is a technology as the fact that it is a piecemeal technology that marks the difference between my approach and that of the historicist. In so far as historicism is technological, its approach is not piecemeal, but ‘holistic’.

Mill’s approach is very clearly shown to be holistic when he explains what he means by a ‘State of Society’ (or historical period): ‘What is called a state of society’, he writes, ‘… is the simultaneous state of all the greater social facts or phenomena.’ Examples of these facts are inter alia: ‘The state of industry, of wealth and its distribution’; society’s ‘division into classes, and the relations of those classes to one another; the common beliefs which they entertain … ; their form in government, and the more important of their laws and customs.’ Summing up, Mill characterizes states of society as follows: ‘States of society are like … different ages in the physical frame; they are conditions not in one or a few organs or functions, but of the whole organism.’22

It is this holism which distinguishes historicism most radically from any piecemeal technology, and which makes possible its alliance with certain types of holistic or Utopian social engineering.

This is certainly a somewhat strange alliance; for as we have seen (in section 15) there is a very definite clash between the approach of the historicist and that of the social engineer or the technologist, provided we understand by social engineering the construction of social institutions according to plan. From the point of view of historicism, the historicist approach is just as radically opposed to any kind of social engineering as is the approach of a meteorologist to that of the magician who makes rain; accordingly, social engineering (even the piecemeal approach) has been attacked by historicists as Utopian.23 In spite of that, we find historicism very frequently allied with just those ideas which are typical of holistic or Utopian social engineering, such as the idea of ‘blueprints for a new order’, or of ‘centralized planning’.

Two characteristic representatives of this alliance are Plato and Marx. Plato, a pessimist, believed that all change—or almost all change—is decay; this was his law of historical development. Accordingly, his Utopian blueprint aims at arresting all change;24 it is what would nowadays be called ‘static’. Marx, on the other hand, was an optimist, and possibly (like Spencer) an adherent of a historicist moral theory. Accordingly, his Utopian blueprint was one of a developing or ‘dynamic’ rather than of an arrested society. He predicted, and tried actively to further, a development culminating in an ideal Utopia that knows no political or economic coercion: the state has withered away, each person co-operates freely in accordance with his abilities, and all his needs are satisfied.

The strongest element in the alliance between historicism and Utopianism is, undoubtedly, the holistic approach which is common to both. Historicism is interested in the development, not of aspects of social life, but of ‘society as a whole’; and Utopian engineering is similarly holistic. Both overlook an important fact that will be established in the next section—the fact that ‘wholes’ in this sense can never be the object of scientific inquiry. Both parties are dissatisfied with ‘piecemeal tinkering’ and ‘muddling through’: they wish to adopt more radical methods. And both the historicist and the Utopianist seem to be impressed, and sometimes even deeply perturbed, by the experience of a changing social environment (an experience which is often frightening, and is sometimes described as a ‘social breakdown’). Accordingly, they both attempt to rationalize this change, the one by prophesying the course of social development, and the other by insisting that the change should be strictly and completely controlled, or even that it should be entirely arrested. The control must be complete, for in any department of social life which is not so controlled, there may lurk the dangerous forces that make for unforeseen changes.

Another link between the historicist and the Utopianist is that both believe that their aims or ends are not a matter of choice, or of moral decision, but that they may be scientifically discovered by them within their fields of inquiry. (In this, they differ from the piecemeal technologist and engineer, just as much as from the physical engineer.) Both the historicist and the Utopianist believe that they can find out what the true aims or ends of ‘society’ are; for example, by determining its historical tendencies, or by diagnosing ‘the needs of their time’. Thus they are apt to adopt some kind of historicist moral theory (see section 18). It is no accident that most authors who advocate Utopian ‘planning’ tell us that planning is simply inevitable, owing to the direction in which history is proceeding; and that we must plan, whether we like it or not.25

In the same historicist vein, these authors rebuke their opponents for being mentally backward, and believe that it is their main task ‘to break the old habits of thought, and to find the new keys to the understanding of the changing world’.26 They assert that trends of social change ‘cannot be successfully influenced or even deflected’ until we give up the piecemeal approach, or ‘the spirit of “muddling through” ‘. But it may be doubted whether the new ‘thought on the level of planning’27 is as novel as it is supposed to be, since holism seems to have been characteristic of fairly ancient thought, from Plato onward. I personally believe that quite a good case may be made for the view that the holistic way of thinking (whether about ‘society’ or about ‘nature’), so far from representing a high level or late stage in the development of thought, is characteristic of a pre-scientific stage.
