title: 23 Criticism of Holism
---




Having revealed my own bias, and having sketched the point of view that underlies my criticism as well as the opposition between the piecemeal approach on the one hand and histori-cism and Utopianism on the other, I will now proceed to my main task, the examination of historicist doctrines. I begin with a brief criticism of holism, since this has now turned out to be one of the most crucial positions of the theory to be attacked.

There is a fundamental ambiguity in the use of the word ‘whole’ in recent holistic literature. It is used to denote (a) the totality of all the properties or aspects of a thing, and especially of all the relations holding between its constituent parts, and (b) certain special properties or aspects of the thing in question, namely those which make it appear an organized structure rather than a ‘mere heap’. Wholes in sense (b) have been made the objects of scientific study, especially by the so-called ‘Gestalt’ school of psychology; and there is indeed no reason why we should not study such aspects as the regularities of structure (for example, the symmetry) which can be found in certain things such as organisms, or electrical fields, or machines. Of things that possess such structures it may be said, as Gestalt theory puts it, that they are more than aggregates—’more than the mere sum of their parts’.

Any of the examples of Gestalt theory may be used to show that wholes in sense (b) are very different from wholes in sense (a). If, with the Gestalt theorists, we consider that a melody is more than a mere collection or sequence of single musical sounds, then it is one of the aspects of this sequence of sounds which we select for consideration. It is an aspect which may be clearly distinguished from other aspects, such as the absolute pitch of the first of these sounds, or their average absolute strength. And there are other Gestalt aspects which are even more abstract than those of melody, for example, the rhythm of the melody; for by considering rhythm we neglect even relative pitch, which is important for melody. By thus being selective, the study of a Gestalt, and with it, of any whole in sense (b), is sharply distinguished from the study of a totality, i.e. of a whole in sense (a).

The fact that wholes in sense (b) can be studied scientifically must therefore not be appealed to in order to justify the entirely different claim that wholes in sense (a) can be so studied. The latter claim must be rejected. If we wish to study a thing, we are bound to select certain aspects of it. It is not possible for us to observe or to describe a whole piece of the world, or a whole piece of nature; in fact, not even the smallest whole piece may be so described, since all description is necessarily selective.28 It may even be said that wholes in sense (a) can never be the object of any activity, scientific or otherwise. If we take an organism and transport it to another place, then we deal with it as a physical body, neglecting many of its other aspects. If we kill it, then we have destroyed certain of its properties, but never all of them. In fact, we cannot possibly destroy the totality of its properties and of all the inter-relations of its parts, even if we smash or burn it.

But the fact that wholes in the sense of totalities cannot be made the object of scientific study, or of any other activity such as control or reconstruction, seems to have escaped the holists, even those of them who admit that, as a rule, science is selective.29 They do not doubt the possibility of a scientific grasp of social wholes (in the sense of totalities) because they rely on the precedent of Gestalt psychology. For they believe that the difference between the Gestalt approach and a treatment of social wholes in sense (a), embracing the ‘structure of all social and historical events of an epoch’, lies merely in the fact that a Gestalt may be grasped by direct intuitive perception, while social wholes are ‘too intricate to be understood at a glance’, so that they ‘can only be gradually grasped after long thought, in which all elements are noted, compared, and combined’.30 The holists do not see, in short, that Gestalt perception has simply nothing to do with wholes in sense (a), that all knowledge, whether intuitive or discursive, must be of abstract aspects, and that we can never grasp the ‘concrete structure of social reality itself’.31 Having overlooked this point, they insist that the specialist’s study of ‘petty details’ must be complemented by an ‘integrating’ or ‘synthetic’ method which aims at reconstructing ‘the whole process’; and they assert that ‘sociology will continue to ignore the essential question as long as specialists refuse to see their problems as a whole’.32 But this holistic method necessarily remains a mere programme. Not one example of a scientific description of a whole, concrete social situation is ever cited. And it cannot be cited, since in every such case it would always be easy to point out aspects which have been neglected; aspects that may nevertheless be most important in some context or other.

Yet holists not only plan to study the whole society by an impossible method, they also plan to control and reconstruct our society ‘as a whole’. They prophesy that ‘the power of the State is bound to increase until the State becomes nearly identical with society’.33 The intuition expressed by this passage is clear enough. It is the totalitarian intuition.34 Yet what, apart from conveying this intuition, does the prophecy mean? The term ‘society’ embraces, of course, all social relations, including all personal ones; those of a mother to her child as much as those of a child welfare officer to either of the two. It is for many reasons quite impossible to control all, or ‘nearly’ all, these relationships; if only because with every new control of social relations we create a host of new social relations to be controlled. In short, the impossibility is a logical impossibility.35 (The attempt leads to an infinite regress; the position is similar in the case of an attempt to study the whole of society—which would have to include this study.) Yet there can be no doubt that the Utopianists plan, precisely, to attempt the impossible; for they tell us that, among other things, it will even be possible ‘to mould personal intercourse in a more realistic way’.36 (Nobody doubts, of course, that wholes in sense (b) can be moulded or controlled or even created, as opposed to wholes in sense (a); we can create a melody, for example; but this has nothing to do with Utopian dreams of total control.)

So much for Utopianism. As far as historicism is concerned, the position is similarly hopeless. Historicist holists often assert, by implication, that the historical method is adequate for the treatment of wholes in the sense of totalities.37 But this assertion rests on a misunderstanding. It results from combining the correct belief that history, as opposed to the theoretical sciences, is interested in concrete individual events and in individual personalities rather than in abstract general laws, with the mistaken belief that the ‘concrete’ individuals in which history is interested can be identified with ‘concrete’ wholes in sense (a). But they cannot; for history, like any other kind of inquiry, can only deal with selected aspects of the object in which it is interested. It is a mistake to believe that there can be a history in the holistic sense, a history of ‘States of Society’ which represent ‘the whole of the social organism’ or ‘all the social and historical events of an epoch’. This idea derives from an intuitive view of a history of mankind as a vast and comprehensive stream of development. But such a history cannot be written. Every written history is a history of a certain narrow aspect of this ‘total’ development, and is anyhow a very incomplete history even of the particular incomplete aspect chosen.

The holistic tendencies of Utopianism and of historicism are unified in the following characteristic statement:

We have never had to set up and direct the entire system of nature as completely as we are forced to do to-day with our society, and therefore we have never had to penetrate into the history and structure of the individual worlds of nature. Mankind is tending … to regulate the whole of its social life although it has never attempted to undertake the creation of a second nature …38



This statement illustrates the mistaken belief that if we wish, as holists, to treat ‘the entire system of nature completely’, it will be helpful to adopt a historical method. But the natural sciences, such as geology, which have adopted this method are far from grasping the ‘entire system’ of their subject-matter. Also illustrated by this statement is the incorrect view that it is possible to ‘set up’ or ‘direct’ or ‘regulate’ or ‘create’ wholes in sense (a). That ‘we have never had to set up and direct the entire system of nature’ is certainly true, simply because we cannot even set up and direct one single piece of physical apparatus in its ‘entirety’. Such things cannot be done. They are Utopian dreams, or perhaps misunderstandings. And to tell us that we are forced to-day to do a thing which is logically impossible, namely to set up and direct the entire system of society, and to regulate the whole of social life, is merely a typical attempt to threaten us with ‘historical forces’ and ‘impending developments’ which make Utopian planning inevitable.

Incidentally, the statement quoted is interesting as an admission of the very significant fact that there exists no physical analogy of holistic engineering or of the corresponding ‘science’. The pursuit of the analogy between natural and social science is therefore certainly helpful in clarifying the issue here.

Such is the logical status of holism, the rock on which we are encouraged to build a new world.

A critical remark may be added on wholes in sense (b), which I have admitted to scientific status. Without retracting anything I have said, I must point out that the triviality as well as the vagueness of the statement that the whole is more than the sum of its parts seems to be seldom realized. Even three apples on a plate are more than ‘a mere sum’, in so far as there must be certain relations between them (the biggest may or may not lie between the others, etc.): relations which do not follow from the fact that there are three apples, and which can be studied scientifically. Also, the much advertised opposition between the ‘atomistic’ and the ‘Gestalt’ approach is entirely baseless, at least as far as atomic physics is concerned: for atomic physics does not merely ‘sum up’ its elementary particles, but studies particle systems from a point of view most definitely concerned with wholes in sense (b).39

What most of the Gestalt theorists apparently wish to assert is the existence of two kinds of things, ‘heaps’, in which we cannot discern any order, and ‘wholes’, in which an order or symmetry or a regularity or a system or a structural plan may be found. Thus, a sentence such as ‘Organisms are wholes’ reduces itself to the triviality that, in an organism, we can discern some order. Besides, a so-called ‘heap’, as a rule, has a Gestalt aspect too, just as much as die often cited example of the electrical field. (Consider the regular manner in which pressure increases within a heap of stones.) Thus the distinction is not only trivial, but exceedingly vague; and is not applicable to different kinds of things, but merely to different aspects of the same things.
