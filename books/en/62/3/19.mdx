title: 19 Practical Aims of This Criticism
---




Whether the true motive of scientific inquiry is the desire to know, that is to say, a purely theoretical or ‘idle’ curiosity, or whether we should rather understand science as an instrument for solving the practical problems that arise in the struggle for life, this is a question that need not be decided here. It will be admitted that the defenders of the rights of ‘pure’ or ‘fundamental’ research deserve every support in their fight against the narrow view, unfortunately again fashionable, that scientific research is justified only if it proves to be a sound investment.1 But even the somewhat extreme view (to which I personally incline) that science is most significant as one of the greatest spiritual adventures that man has yet known may be combined with a recognition of the importance of practical problems and practical tests for the progress of science, whether applied or pure; for practice is invaluable for scientific speculation, both as a spur and as a bridle. One need not espouse pragmatism in order to appreciate Kant’s saying:

To yield to every whim of curiosity, and to allow our passion for inquiry to be restrained by nothing but the limits of our ability, this shows an eagerness of mind not unbecoming to scholarship. But it is wisdom that has the merit of selecting, from among the innumerable problems which present themselves, those whose solution is important to mankind.2



The application of this to the biological and perhaps even more to the social sciences is clear. Pasteur’s reform of the biological sciences was carried out under the stimulus of highly practical problems, which were in part industrial and agricultural. And social research nowadays has a practical urgency surpassing even that of cancer research. As Professor Hayek says, ‘economic analysis has never been the product of detached intellectual curiosity about the why of social phenomena, but of an intense urge to reconstruct a world which gives rise to profound dissatisfaction’;3 and some of the social sciences, other than economics, that have not yet adopted this outlook, show by the barrenness of their results how urgently their speculations are in need of practical checks.

The need for the stimulus of practical problems is equally clear when we consider inquiries into the methods of scientific research, and more especially, into the methods of the generalizing or theoretical social sciences with which we are concerned here. The more fruitful debates on method are always inspired by certain practical problems which face the research worker; and nearly all debates on method which are not so inspired are characterized by that atmosphere of futile subtlety which has brought methodology into disrepute with the practical research worker. It should be realized that methodological debates of the more practical kind are not only useful but also necessary. In the development and improvement of method, as of science itself, we learn only by trial and error, and we need the criticism of others in order to find out our mistakes; and this criticism is the more important since the introduction of new methods may mean a change of a fundamental and revolutionary character. All this may be illustrated by examples such as the introduction of mathematical methods into economics, or of the so-called ‘subjective’ or ‘psychological’ methods into value theory. A more recent example is the combination of the methods of this theory with statistical methods (‘demand analysis’). This last revolution in method was partly the outcome of prolonged and largely critical debates; a fact from which the apologist for the study of method may certainly draw encouragement.

A practical approach to the study of both the social sciences and their method is advocated by many of the followers of his-toricism who hope that they will be able to transform, by the use of historicist methods, the social sciences into a powerful instrument in the hands of the politician. It is this recognition of the practical task of the social sciences which provides something like a common ground for discussion between the histori-cists and some of their opponents; and I am ready to take my own stand on this common ground in order to criticize historicism as a poor method, unable to yield the results it promises.
