title: 17 Interpreting Versus Planning Social Change
---




The historicist view of social development does not imply fatalism nor need it lead to inactivity—quite the contrary. Most historicists have very marked tendencies towards ‘activism’ (see section 1). Historicism fully recognizes that our wishes and thoughts, our dreams and our reasoning, our fears and our knowledge, our interests and our energies, are all forces in the development of society. It does not teach that nothing can be brought about; it only predicts that neither your dreams nor what your reason constructs will ever be brought about according to plan. Only such plans as fit in with the main current of history can be effective. We can now see exactly the sort of activity admitted by historicists to be reasonable. Only such activities are reasonable as fit in with, and help along, the impending changes. Social midwifery is the only perfectly reasonable activity open to us, the only activity that can be based upon scientific foresight.

Although no scientific theory as such can directly encourage activity (it could only discourage certain activities as unrealistic), it can, by implication, give encouragement to those who feel that they ought to do something. Historicism definitely offers this kind of encouragement. It even gives human reason a certain part to play; for it is scientific reasoning, historicist social science, which alone can tell us the direction any reasonable activity must take if it is to coincide with the direction of impending changes.

Historical prophecy and the interpretation of history must thus become the basis of any thought-out and realistic social action. Consequently, interpretation of history must be the central job of historicist thought; and in point of fact it has become so. All the thoughts and all the activities of historicists aim at interpreting the past, in order to predict the future.

Can historicism offer hope or encouragement to those who want to see a better world? Only a historicist who takes an optimistic view of social development, believing it to be intrinsically ‘good’ or ‘rational’, in the sense of tending intrinsically towards a better, towards a more reasonable state of affairs, could offer such hope. But this view would amount to a belief in social and political miracles, since it denies to human reason the power of bringing about a more reasonable world. In fact, some influential historicist writers have optimistically foretold the coming of a realm of freedom, in which human affairs could be planned rationally. And they teach that the transition from the realm of necessity in which mankind at present suffers to the realm of freedom and reason cannot be brought about by reason but—miraculously—only by harsh necessity, by the blind and inexorable laws of historical development, to which they counsel us to submit.

Those who desire an increase in the influence of reason in social life can only be advised by historicism to study and interpret history, in order to discover the laws of its development. If such interpretation reveals that changes answering to their desire are impending, then the desire is a reasonable one, for it agrees with scientific prediction. If the impending development happens to tend in another direction, then the wish to make the world more reasonable turns out to be entirely unreasonable; to historicists it is then just a Utopian dream. Activism can be justified only so long as it acquiesces in impending changes and helps them along.

I have already shown that the naturalistic method, as seen by historicism, implies a definite sociological theory—the theory that society does not significantly develop or change. We now find that the historicist method implies a strangely similar sociological theory—the theory that society will necessarily change but along a predetermined path that cannot change, through stages predetermined by inexorable necessity.

‘When a society has discovered the natural law that determines its own movement, even then it can neither overleap the natural phases of its evolution, nor shuffle them out of the world by a stroke of the pen. But this much it can do: it can shorten and lessen the birthpangs.’ This formulation, due to Marx,2 excellently represents the historicist position. Although it teaches neither inactivity nor real fatalism, historicism teaches the futility of any attempt to alter impending changes; a peculiar variety of fatalism, a fatalism in regard to the trends of history, as it were. Admittedly, the ‘activist’ exhortation ‘The philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways: the point, however, is to change it’,3 may find much sympathy with historicists (seeing that ‘world’ means here the developing human society) because of its emphasis on change. But it is in conflict with the most significant doctrines of historicism. For as we now see, we may say: ‘The historicist can only interpret social development and aid it in various ways; his point, however, is that nobody can change it.’
