title: 14 Historical Laws
---




We have seen that sociology, to the historicist, is theoretical history. Its scientific forecasts must be based on laws, and since they are historical forecasts, forecasts of social change, they must be based on historical laws.

But at the same time the historicist holds that the method of generalization is inapplicable to social science, and that we must not assume uniformities of social life to be invariably valid through space and time, since they usually apply only to a certain cultural or historical period. Thus social laws—if there are any real social laws—must have a somewhat different structure from the ordinary generalizations based on uniformities. Real social laws would have to be ‘generally’ valid. But this can only mean that they apply to the whole of human history, covering all of its periods rather than merely some of them. But there can be no social uniformities which hold good beyond single periods. Thus the only universally valid laws of society must be the laws which link up the successive periods. They must be laws of historical development which determine the transition from one period to another. This is what historicists mean by saying that the only real laws of sociology are historical laws.
