title: 18 Conclusion of the Analysis
---




It might be felt that my last formulations deviate from my avowed intention of outlining the historicist position as sharply and as convincingly as possible before proceeding to criticize it. For these formulations try to show that the leanings of some historicists towards optimism or activism are defeated by the outcome of the historicist analysis itself. This may seem to imply the charge that historicism is inconsistent. And it may be objected that it is not fair to allow criticism and irony to creep into an exposition.

I do not think this reproach would be just, however. Only those who are optimists or activists first, and historicists afterwards, can take my remarks as critical in an adverse sense. (There will be many who feel in this way: those who were originally attracted to historicism because of their leanings towards optimism or activism.) But to those who are primarily historicists, my remarks ought to appear not as a criticism of their historicist doctrines but only as a criticism of attempts to link it with optimism or activism.

Not all the forms of activism are thus criticized as incompatible with historicism, to be sure, but only some of its more extravagant forms. As compared with a naturalistic method, a pure historicist would argue, historicism does encourage activity, because of its stress on change, process, motion; yet it certainly cannot blindly countenance all kinds of activities as being reasonable from a scientific point of view; many possible activities are unrealistic, and their failure can be foreseen by science. This, he would say, is the reason why he and other historicists impose limitations on the scope of what they can admit to be useful activity, and why an emphasis upon these limitations is necessary for any clear analysis of historicism. And he might contend that the two Marxian quotations (in the foregoing section) do not contradict each other, but are complementary; that although the second (and older one) taken by itself could perhaps appear as slightly too ‘activist’, its proper limits are set by the first; and that should the second have appealed to over-radical activists and influenced them to embrace historicism, then the first ought to have taught them the proper limits of any activity, even though it may thereby have alienated their sympathies.

It seems to me for these reasons that my exposition is not unfair, but that it merely dears the ground in regard to activism. Similarly, I do not think that my other remark in the foregoing section, to the effect that historicist optimism must rest on faith alone (since reason is denied the role of bringing about a more reasonable world), is to be considered as an adverse criticism of historicism. It may appear adverse to those who are primarily optimists or rationalists. But the consistent historicist will see in this analysis only a useful warning against the romantic and Utopian character of both optimism and pessimism in their usual forms, and of rationalism too. He will insist that a truly scientific historicism must be independent of such elements; that we simply have to submit to the existing laws of development, just as we have to submit to the law of gravity.

The historicist may even go further. He may add that the most reasonable attitude to adopt is so to adjust one’s system of values as to make it conform with the impending changes. If this is done, one arrives at a form of optimism which can be justified, since any change will then necessarily be a change for the better, if judged by that system of values.

Ideas of this kind have actually been held by some historicists, and have even been developed into a fairly coherent (and quite popular) historicist moral theory: the morally good is the morally progressive, i.e. the morally good is what is ahead of its time in conforming to such standards of conduct as will be adopted in the period to come.

This historicist moral theory, which could be described as ‘moral modernism’ or ‘moral futurism’ (it has its counterpart in an aesthetic modernism or futurism) accords well with the anti-conservative attitude of historicism; it can also be considered as a reply to certain questions concerning values (see section 6, on ‘Objectivity and Valuation’). Above all, it can be looked upon as an indication that historicism—which, in this study, is seriously examined only in so far as it is a doctrine of method—might be amplified and developed into a full-scale philosophical system. Or, to put it in another way: it seems not improbable that the historicist method might have originated as a part of a general philosophical interpretation of the world. For there can be no doubt that, from the standpoint of history although not of logic, methodologies are usually by-products of philosophical views. I intend to examine these historicist philosophies elsewhere.4 Here I will only criticize the methodological doctrines of historicism, as they were presented above.
