title: 15 Historical Prophecy versus Social Engineering
---




As indicated, these historical laws (if they can be discovered) would permit the prediction of even very distant events, although not with minute exactness of detail. Thus the doctrine that real sociological laws are historical laws (a doctrine mainly derived from the limited validity of social uniformities) leads back, independently of any attempt to emulate astronomy, to the idea of ‘large-scale forecasts’. And it makes this idea more concrete, for it shows that these forecasts have the character of historical prophecies.

Sociology thus becomes, to the historicist, an attempt to solve the old problem of foretelling the future; not so much the future of the individual as that of groups, and of the human race. It is the science of things to come, of impending developments. If the attempt to furnish us with political foresight of scientific validity were to succeed, then sociology would prove to be of the greatest value to politicians, especially to those whose vision extends beyond the exigencies of the present, to politicians with a sense of historic destiny. Some historicists, it is true, are content to predict only the next stages of the human pilgrimage, and even these in very cautious terms. But one idea is common to them all—that sociological study should help to reveal the political future, and that it could thereby become the foremost instrument of far-sighted practical politics.

From the point of view of the pragmatic value of science, the significance of scientific predictions is clear enough. It has not always been realized, however, that two different kinds of prediction can be distinguished in science, and accordingly two different ways of being practical. We may predict (a) the coming of a typhoon, a prediction which may be of the greatest practical value because it may enable people to take shelter in time; but we may also predict (b) that if a certain shelter is to stand up to a typhoon, it must be constructed in a certain way, for instance, with ferroconcrete buttresses on its north side.

These two kinds of predictions are obviously very different although both are important and fulfil age-old dreams. In the one case we are told about an event which we can do nothing to prevent. I shall call such a prediction a ‘prophecy’. Its practical value lies in our being warned of the predicted event, so that we can side-step it or meet it prepared (possibly with the help of predictions of the other kind).

Opposed to these are predictions of the second kind which we can describe as technological predictions since predictions of this kind form a basis of engineering. They are, so to speak, constructive, intimating the steps open to us if we want to achieve certain results. The greater part of physics (nearly the whole of it apart from astronomy and meteorology) makes predictions of such a form that, considered from a practical standpoint, they can be described as technological prediction. The distinction between these two sorts of prediction roughly coincides with the lesser or greater importance of the part played by designed experiment, as opposed to mere patient observation, in the science concerned. The typical experimental sciences are capable of making technological predictions, while those employing mainly non-experimental observations produce prophecies.

I do not wish to be taken as implying that all sciences, or even all scientific predictions, are fundamentally practical—that they are necessarily either prophetic or technological and cannot be anything else. I only want to draw attention to a distinction between the two kinds of prediction and the sciences corresponding to them. In choosing the terms ‘prophetic’ and ‘technological’, I certainly wish to hint at a feature they exhibit if looked at from the pragmatic standpoint; but my use of this terminology is neither intended to mean that the pragmatic point of view is necessarily superior to any other, nor that scientific interest is limited to pragmatically important prophecies and to predictions of a technological character. If we consider astronomy, for example, then we have to admit that its findings are mainly of theoretical interest even though they are not valueless from a pragmatic point of view; but as ‘prophecies’ they are all akin to those of meteorology whose value for practical activities is quite obvious.

It is worth noting that this difference between the prophetic and the engineering character of sciences does not correspond to the difference between long-term and short-term predictions. Although most engineering predictions are short-term there are also long-term technological predictions, for instance, about the lifetime of an engine. Again, astronomical prophecies may be either short-term or long-term, and most meteorological prophecies are comparatively short-term.

The difference between these two practical aims—prophesying and engineering—and the corresponding difference in the structure of relevant scientific theories, will be seen later to be one of the major points in our methodological analysis. For the moment I only wish to stress that historicists, quite consistently with their belief that sociological experiments are useless and impossible, argue for historical prophecy—the prophecy of social, political and institutional developments—and against social engineering, as the practical aim of the social sciences. The idea of social engineering, the planning and construction of institutions, with the aim, perhaps, of arresting or of controlling or of quickening impending social developments, appears to some historicists as possible. To others, this would seem an almost impossible undertaking, or one which overlooks the fact that political planning, like all social activity, must stand under the superior sway of historical forces.
