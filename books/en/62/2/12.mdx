title: 12 The Observational Basis
---




A non-experimental observational basis for a science is, in a certain sense of the term, always ‘historical’ in character. That is so even with the observational basis of astronomy. The facts on which astronomy is based are contained in the records of the observatory; records which inform us, for instance, that at such and such a date (hour, second) the planet Mercury has been observed by Mr. So-and-so in a certain position. In short, they give us a ‘register of events in order of time’, or a chronicle of observations.

Similarly, the observational basis of sociology can be given only in the form of a chronicle of events, namely of political or social happenings. This chronicle of political and other important happenings in social life is what one customarily calls ‘history’. History in this narrow sense is the basis of sociology.

It would be ridiculous to deny the importance of history in this narrow sense as an empirical basis for social science. But one of the characteristic claims of historicism which is closely associated with its denial of the applicability of the experimental method is that history, political and social, is the only empirical source of sociology. Thus the historicist visualizes sociology as a theoretical and empirical discipline whose empirical basis is formed by a chronicle of the facts of history alone, and whose aim is to make forecasts, preferably large-scale forecasts. Clearly, these forecasts must also be of a historical character, since their testing by experience, their verification or refutation, must be left to future history. Thus the making and testing of large-scale historical forecasts is the task of sociology as seen by historicism. In brief, the historicist claims that sociology is theoretical history.
