title: 13 Social Dynamics
---




The analogy between social science and astronomy can be developed further. The part of astronomy which historicists usually consider, celestial mechanics, is based on dynamics, the theory of motions as determined by forces. Historicist writers have often insisted that sociology should be based in a similar way on a social dynamics, the theory of social movement as determined by social (or historical) forces.

Statics, the physicist knows, is only an abstraction from dynamics; it is, as it were, the theory of how and why, under certain circumstances, nothing happens, i.e. why change does not occur; and it explains this by the equality of counteracting forces. Dynamics, on the other hand, deals with the general case, i.e. with forces equal or unequal, and might be described as the theory of how and why something does happen. Thus, only dynamics can give us the real, universally valid laws of mechanics; for nature is process; it moves, changes, develops—although sometimes only slowly, so that some developments may be difficult to observe.

The analogy of this view of dynamics to the historicist’s view of sociology is obvious and needs no further comment. But, the historicist might claim, the analogy goes deeper. He might claim, for instance, that sociology, as conceived by historicism, is akin to dynamics because it is essentially a causal theory; for causal explanation in general is an explanation of how and why certain things happened. Basically, such an explanation must always have a historical element. If you ask someone who has broken his leg how and why it happened, you expect that he will tell you the history of the accident. But even on the level of theoretical thought, and especially on the level of theories permitting prediction, a historical analysis of the causes of an event is necessary. A typical example of the need for a historical causal analysis, the historicist will assert, is the problem of the origins, or the essential causes, of war.

In physics, such an analysis is achieved by a determination of the interacting forces, i.e. by dynamics; and the historicist claims that the same should be attempted by sociology. It has to analyse the forces which produce social change and create human history. From dynamics we learn how the interacting forces constitute new forces; and conversely, by analysing forces into their components, we are able to penetrate into the more fundamental causes of the events under consideration. Similarly, historicism demands the recognition of the fundamental importance of historical forces, whether spiritual or material; for example, religious or ethical ideas, or economic interests. To analyse, to disentangle this thicket of conflicting tendencies and forces and to penetrate to its roots, to the universal driving forces and laws of social change—this is the task of the social sciences, as seen by historicism. Only in this way can we develop a theoretical science on which to base those large-scale forecasts whose confirmation would mean the success of social theory.
