title: 9 Quantitative Methods
---




Among the oppositions and contrasts usually stressed in connection with the doctrine of intuitive understanding the following has frequently been emphasized by historicists. In physics, it is said, events are explained rigorously and precisely, in quantitative terms, and with the aid of mathematical formulae. Sociology, on the other hand, tries to understand historical development more in qualitative terms; for example, in terms of conflicting tendencies and aims.

The argument against the applicability of quantitative and mathematical methods is by no means peculiar to historicists; and, indeed, such methods are sometimes repudiated even by writers with strong anti-historicist views. But some of the most persuasive arguments against quantitative and mathematical methods bring out very well the point of view which I call historicism, and these arguments will be discussed here.

When we consider the opposition to the use of quantitative and mathematical methods in sociology, a strong objection must at once occur to us: this attitude seems to be in conflict with the facts that quantitative and mathematical methods are actually being used with great success in some of the social sciences. How, in face of this, can it be denied that they are applicable?

Against this objection, the opposition to the quantitative and mathematical point of view may be upheld by some arguments characteristic of historicist ways of thinking.

I quite agree, the historicist may say, with your remarks; but there still remains a tremendous difference between the statistical methods of the social sciences and the quantitative-mathematical methods of physics. The social sciences know nothing that can be compared to the mathematically formulated causal laws of physics.

Consider, for instance, the physical law that (for light of any given wave-length) the smaller the aperture through which a light ray passes, the greater is the angle of diffraction. A physical law of this type has the form: ‘Under certain conditions, if magnitude A varies in a certain manner, then magnitude B also varies in some predictable manner’. In other words, such a law expresses a dependence of one measurable quantity on another and the manner in which the one quantity depends on the other is laid down in exact quantitative terms. Physics has been successful in expressing all its laws in this form. In order to achieve this, its first task was to translate all physical qualities into quantitative terms. For instance, it had to replace the qualitative description of a certain kind of light—e.g. a bright yellow-greenish light—by a quantitative description: light of a certain wave-length and of a certain intensity. Such a process of quantitatively describing physical qualities is obviously a necessary pre-requisite for the quantitative formulation of causal physical laws. These enable us to explain why something has happened; for example, under the assumption of the law concerning the relations between the width of an aperture and the angle of diffraction, we can give a causal explanation of an increase of the angle of diffraction in terms of the fact that the aperture was decreased.

Causal explanation, the historicist maintains, must also be attempted by the social sciences. They may, for instance, undertake to explain imperialism in terms of industrial expansion. But if we consider this example we see at once that it is hopeless to attempt to express sociological laws in quantitative terms. For if we consider some such formulation as ‘the tendency towards territorial expansion increases with the intensity of industrialization’ (a formulation which at least is an intelligible, though probably not a true description of facts) we shall very soon find that we lack any method which could measure the tendency towards expansion, or the intensity of industrialization.

To sum up the historicist argument against quantitative-mathematical methods, it is the sociologist’s task to give a causal explanation of the changes undergone, in the course of history, by such social entities as, for instance, states, or economic systems, or forms of government. As there is no known way of expressing in quantitative terms the qualities of these entities, no quantitative laws can be formulated. Thus, the causal laws of the social sciences, supposing that there are any, must differ widely in character from those of physics, being qualitative rather than quantitative and mathematical. If sociological laws determine the degree of anything, they will do so only in very vague terms, and will permit, at the best, a very rough scaling.

It appears that qualities—whether physical or non-physical— can only be appraised by intuition. The arguments we have discussed here can therefore be used to support those that have been offered in favour of the method of intuitive understanding.
