title: 10 Essentialism versus Nominalism
---





The emphasis on the qualitative character of social events leads further to the problem of the status of the terms which denote qualities: to the so-called problem of universals, one of the oldest and most fundamental problems of philosophy.

This problem, over which a major battle raged during the Middle Ages, is rooted in the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. It is usually interpreted as a purely metaphysical problem; but like most metaphysical problems it can be re-formulated so as to become a problem of scientific method. We shall deal only with the methodological problem here, giving a brief outline of the metaphysical issue by way of an introduction.

Every science uses terms which are called universal terms, such as ‘energy’, ‘velocity’, ‘carbon’, ‘whiteness’, ‘evolution’, ‘justice’, ‘state’, ‘humanity’. These are distinct from the sort of terms which we call singular terms or individual concepts, like ‘Alexander the Great’, ‘Halley’s Comet’, ‘The First World War’. Such terms as these are proper names, labels attached by convention to the individual things denoted by them.

Over the nature of universal terms a long and sometimes bitter dispute raged between two parties. One held that universals differ from proper names only in being attached to the members of a set or class of single things, rather than to just one single thing. The universal term ‘white’, for instance, seemed to this party to be nothing but a label attached to a set of many different things—snowflakes, tablecloths, and swans, for instance. This is the doctrine of the nominalist party. It is opposed by a doctrine traditionally called ‘realism’—a somewhat misleading name, as seen by the fact that this ‘realist’ theory has also been called ‘idealist’. I therefore propose to re-name this anti-nominalistic theory ‘essentialism’. Essentialists deny that we first collect a group of single things and then label them ‘white’; rather, they say, we call each single white thing ‘white’ on account of a certain intrinsic property that it shares with other white things, namely ‘whiteness’. This property, denoted by the universal term, is regarded as an object which deserves investigation just as much as the individual things themselves. (The name ‘realism’ derives from the assertion that universal objects, for instance, whiteness, ‘really’ exist, over and above single things and sets or groups of single things.) Thus universal terms are held to denote universal objects, just as singular terms denote individual things. These universal objects (called by Plato ‘Forms’ or ‘Ideas’) which are designated by the universal terms were also called ‘essences’.

But essentialism not only believes in the existence of univer-sals (i.e. of universal objects), it also stresses their importance for science. Singular objects, it points out, show many accidental features, features which are of no interest to science. To take an example from the social sciences: economics interests itself in money and credit, but it does not care about the particular shapes in which coins, banknotes or cheques appear. Science must strip away the accidental and penetrate to the essence of things. But the essence of anything is always something universal.

These last remarks indicate some of the methodological implications of this metaphysical problem. However, the methodological issue I am now going to discuss may in fact be considered independently of the metaphysical issue. We will approach it along another path—one that avoids the question of the existence of universal and singular objects, and of their differences. We will discuss merely the ends and means of science.

The school of thinkers whom I propose to call methodological essentialists was founded by Aristotle, who taught that scientific research must penetrate to the essence of things in order to explain them. Methodological essentialists are inclined to formulate scientific questions in such terms as ‘what is matter?’ or ‘what is force?’ or ‘what is justice?’ and they believe that a penetrating answer to such questions, revealing the real or essential meaning of these terms and thereby the real or true nature of the essences denoted by them, is at least a necessary prerequisite of scientific research, if not its main task. Methodological nominalists, as opposed to this, would put their problems in such terms as ‘how does this piece of matter behave?’ or ‘how does it move in the presence of other bodies?’ For methodological nominalists hold that the task of science is only to describe how things behave, and suggest that this is to be done by freely introducing new terms wherever necessary, or by re-defining old terms wherever convenient while cheerfully neglecting their original meaning. For they regard words merely as useful instruments of description.

Most people will admit that methodological nominalism has been victorious in the natural sciences. Physics does not inquire, for instance, into the essence of atoms or of light, but it uses these terms with great freedom to explain and describe certain physical observations, and also as names of certain important and complicated physical structures. So it is with biology. Philosophers may demand from biologists the solution of such problems as ‘what is life?’ or ‘what is evolution?’ and at times some biologists may feel inclined to meet such demands. Nevertheless, scientific biology deals on the whole with different problems, and adopts explanatory and descriptive methods very similar to those used in physics.

Thus in the social sciences we should expect methodological naturalists to favour nominalism, and anti-naturalists to favour essentialism. Yet in fact essentialism seems to have the upper hand here; and it is not even faced by any very energetic opposition. It has therefore been suggested that while the methods of the natural sciences are fundamentally nominalistic, social science must adopt a methodological essentialism.2 It is argued that the task of social science is to understand and explain such sociological entities as the state, economic action, the social group, etc., and that this can be done only by penetrating into their essences. Every important sociological entity presupposes universal terms for its description and it would be pointless freely to introduce new terms, as has been done so successfully in the natural sciences. The task of social science is to describe such entities clearly and properly, i.e. to distinguish the essential from the accidental; but this requires knowledge of their essence. Problems such as ‘what is the State?’ and ‘what is a citizen?’ (considered by Aristotle to be the basic problems of his Politics), or ‘what is credit?’ or ‘what is the essential difference between the churchman and the sectarian (or the church and the sect)?’ are not only perfectly legitimate, but are precisely the kind of question which sociological theories are designed to answer.

Although historicists may differ in their attitude towards the metaphysical issue, and in their opinion with regard to the methodology of natural science, it is clear that they will be inclined to side with essentialism and against nominalism so far as the methodology of social science is concerned. In fact, nearly every historicist I know of takes this attitude. But it is worth considering whether it is only the general anti-naturalistic tendency of historicism that accounts for this, or whether there are any specific historicist arguments that may be urged in favour of methodological essentialism.

In the first place it is clear that the argument against the use of quantitative methods in social science is relevant to this issue. The emphasis on the qualitative character of social events, together with the emphasis on intuitive understanding (as opposed to mere description), indicates an attitude closely related to essentialism.

But there are other arguments, more typical of historicism, which follow a trend of thought that will by now be familiar to the reader. (Incidentally, they are practically the same arguments as those which, according to Aristotle, led Plato to develop the first theory of essences.)

Historicism stresses the importance of change. Now in every change, the historicist might argue, there must be something that changes. Even if nothing remains unchanged, we must be able to identify what has changed in order to speak of change at all. This is comparatively easy in physics. In mechanics, for example, all changes are movements, i.e. spatio-temporal changes, of physical bodies. But sociology, which is chiefly interested in social institutions, faces greater difficulties, for such institutions are not so easy to identify after they have undergone change. In the simple descriptive sense it is not possible to regard a social institution before a change as the same as that institution after a change; it might, from the descriptive point of view, be entirely different. A naturalistic description of contemporary institutions of government in Britain, for example, might have to present them as entirely different from what they were four centuries ago. Yet we can say that, in so far as there is a government, it is essentially the same, even though it may have changed considerably. Its function within modern society is essentially analogous to the function it then fulfilled. Though hardly any describable features have remained the same, the essential identity of the institution is preserved, permitting us to regard one institution as a changed form of the other: we cannot speak, in the social sciences, of changes or developments without presupposing an unchanging essence, and hence without proceeding in accordance with methodological essentialism.

It is plain, of course, that some sociological terms, such as depression, inflation, deflation, etc., were originally introduced in a purely nominalistic fashion. But even so they have not retained their nominalistic character. As conditions change, we soon find social scientists disagreeing about whether certain phenomena are really inflations or not; thus for the sake of precision it may become necessary to investigate the essential nature (or the essential meaning) of inflation.

So it can be said of any social entity that it ‘might, so far as its essence is concerned, be present at any other place and in any other form, and might likewise change whilst remaining in fact unchanged, or change otherwise than in the way in which it actually does’ (Husserl). The extent of possible changes cannot be limited a priori. It is impossible to say what sort of change a social entity can withstand and yet remain the same. Phenomena which from some standpoints may be essentially different, may from others be essentially the same.

From the historicist arguments developed above, it follows that a bare description of social developments is impossible; or rather, that a sociological description can never be merely a description in the nominalist sense. And if a sociological description cannot dispense with essences, a theory of social development will be even less able to do so. For who would deny that problems such as the determination and explanation of the characteristic features of a certain social period, together with its tensions and intrinsic tendencies and trends, must defy all attempts at treatment by nominalist methods?

Methodological essentialism can accordingly be based on the historicist argument which actually led Plato to his metaphysical essentialism, the Heraclitean argument that changing things defy rational description. Hence science or knowledge presupposes something that does not change but remains identical with itself—an essence. History, i.e. the description of change, and essence, i.e. that which remains unchanged during change, appear here as correlative concepts. But this correlation has yet another side: in a certain sense, an essence also presupposes change, and thereby history. For if that principle of a thing which remains identical or unchanged when the thing changes is its essence (or idea, or form, or nature, or substance), then the changes which the thing undergoes bring to light different sides or aspects or possibilities of the thing and therefore of its essence. The essence, accordingly, can be interpreted as the sum or source of the potentialities inherent in the thing, and the changes (or movements) can be interpreted as the realization or actualization of the hidden potentialities of its essence. (This theory is due to Aristotle.) It follows that a thing, i.e. its unchanging essence, can be known only through its changes. If, for instance, we want to find out whether a certain thing is made of gold, we have to beat it, or to test it chemically, thus changing it and thereby unfolding some of its hidden potentialities. In the same way, the essence of a man—his personality—can only be known as it unfolds itself in his biography. Applying this principle to sociology we are led to the conclusion that the essence or the real character of a social group can reveal itself, and be known, only through its history. But if social groups can be known only through their history, the concepts used to describe them must be historical concepts; and indeed, such sociological concepts as the Japanese state or the Italian nation or the Aryan race can hardly be interpreted as anything but concepts based on the study of history. The same is valid for social classes: the bourgeoisie, for instance, can only be defined by its history: as the class that came to power through the industrial revolution, that pushed aside the landlords, and that is fighting and being fought by the proletariat, etc.

Essentialism may have been introduced on the ground that it enables us to detect an identity in things that change, but it furnishes in its turn some of the most powerful arguments in support of the doctrine that the social sciences must adopt a historical method; that is to say, in support of the doctrine of historicism.
