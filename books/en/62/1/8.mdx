title: 8 Intuitive Understanding
---




We have dealt so far mainly with certain characteristic aspects of social life, such as novelty, complexity, organicity, holism, and the way its history falls into periods; aspects which, according to historicism, render certain typical methods of physics inapplicable to the social sciences. A more historical method of approach is therefore considered necessary in social studies. It is part of the anti-naturalistic view of historicism that we must try to understand intuitively the history of the various social groups, and this view is sometimes developed into a methodological doctrine which is very closely related to historicism, although it is not invariably combined with it.

It is the doctrine that the proper method of the social sciences, as opposed to the method of the natural sciences, is based upon an intimate understanding of social phenomena. The following oppositions and contrasts are usually stressed in connection with this doctrine. Physics aims at causal explanation: sociology at an understanding of purpose and meaning. In physics events are explained rigorously and quantitatively, and with the aid of mathematical formulae. Sociology tries to understand historical developments in more qualitative terms, for example, in terms of conflicting tendencies and aims, or in terms of ‘national character’, or ‘spirit of the age’. This is why physics operates with inductive generalizations whereas sociology can only operate with the help of sympathetic imagination. And it is also the reason why physics can arrive at universally valid uniformities, and explain particular events as instances of such uniformities, whereas sociology must be content with the intuitive understanding of unique events, and of the role they play in particular situations, occurring within particular struggles of interests, tendencies, and destinies.

I propose to distinguish between three different variants of the doctrine of intuitive understanding. The first asserts that a social event is understood when analysed in terms of the forces that brought it about, i.e. when the individuals and groups involved, their purposes or interests, and the power they can dispose of, are known. The actions of individuals or groups are here understood as being in accordance with their aims—as promoting their real advantage or, at least, their imagined advantage. The method of sociology is here thought of as an imaginative reconstruction of either rational or irrational activities, directed towards certain ends.

The second variant goes further. It admits that such an analysis is necessary, particularly in regard to the understanding of individual actions or group activities. But it maintains that more is needed for the understanding of social life. If we want to understand the meaning of a social event, a certain political action for instance, then it is not enough to understand, teleologically, how and why it was brought about. Over and above that, we must understand its meaning, the significance of its occurrence. What is here meant by ‘meaning’ and ‘significance’? From the standpoint I am describing as the second variant, the reply would be: a social event not only exerts certain influences, it not only leads, in time, to other events, but its very coming into existence changes the situational value of a wide range of other events. It creates a new situation, demanding a re-orientation and re-interpretation of all objects and of all actions in that particular field. To understand such an event as, say, the creation of a new army in a certain country, it is necessary to analyse intentions, interests, and so forth. But we cannot fully understand the meaning or significance of this action without also analysing its situational value; the military forces of another country, for example, which were fully sufficient for its protection up to that time, may now have become quite inadequate. In short, the whole social situation may have changed, even before any further factual changes have occurred, either physical or even psychological; for the situation may have changed long before the change has been noticed by anybody. Thus in order to understand social life, we must go beyond the mere analysis of factual causes and effects, i.e. of motives, interests, and reactions caused by actions: we have to understand every event as playing a certain characteristic part within the whole. The event gains its significance from its influence upon the whole, and its significance is therefore in part determined by the whole.

The third variant of the doctrine of intuitive understanding goes even further, while fully admitting everything maintained by the first and second variant. It holds that to understand the meaning or significance of a social event, more is required than an analysis of its genesis, effects, and situational value. Over and above such an analysis, it is necessary to analyse objective, underlying historical trends and tendencies (such as the growth or decline of certain traditions or powers) prevailing at the period in question, and to analyse the contribution of the event in question to the historical process by which such trends become manifest. A full understanding of the Dreyfus Affair, for instance, demands over and above an analysis of its genesis, effects, and situational value, an insight into the fact that it was the manifestation of the contest between two historical tendencies in the development of the French Republic, democratic and autocratic, progressive and reactionary.

This third variant of the method of intuitive understanding, with its emphasis on historical trends or tendencies, is a position which suggests to a certain extent the application of inference by analogy from one historical period to another. For though it fully recognizes that historical periods are intrinsically different, and that no event can really repeat itself in another period of social development, it can admit that analogous tendencies may become dominant in different periods which are, perhaps, very far removed from one another. Such similarities or analogies have been said to hold, for instance, between Greece before Alexander, and Southern Germany before Bismarck. The method of intuitive understanding suggests, in such cases, that we should evaluate the meaning of certain events by comparing them with analogous events in earlier periods, so as to help us to forecast new developments—never forgetting, however, that the inevitable differences between the two periods must be duly taken into account.

We see, accordingly, that a method capable of understanding the meaning of social events must go far beyond causal explanation. It must be holistic in character; it must aim at determining the role played by the event within a complex structure—within a whole which comprises not only contemporaneous parts but also the successive stages of a temporal development. This may explain why the third variant of the method of intuitive understanding tends to rely upon the analogy between an organism and a group, and why it tends to operate with ideas such as that of a mind or spirit of an age, the source and overseer of all those historical tendencies or trends which play such an important role in determining the meaning of sociological events.

But the method of intuitive understanding does not only fit in with the ideas of holism. It also agrees very well with the historicist’s emphasis on novelty; for novelty cannot be causally or rationally explained, but only intuitively grasped. It will be seen, furthermore, in the discussion of the pro-naturalistic doctrines of historicism, that there is a very close connection between them and our ‘third variant’ of the method of intuitive understanding, with its emphasis on historical tendencies or ‘trends’. (See, for example, section 16.)
