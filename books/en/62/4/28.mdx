title: 28 The Method of Reduction. Causal Explanation. Prediction and Prophecy
---




My criticism of the doctrine of historical laws of succession is in one important respect still inconclusive. I have tried to show that the ‘directions’ or ‘tendencies’ which historicists discern in the succession of events called history are not laws but, if anything, trends. And I have pointed out why a trend, as opposed to a law, must not in general be used as a basis for scientific predictions.

But to this criticism, Mill and Comte—alone in this respectamong historicists, I believe—could still have offered a rejoinder. Mill might perhaps have admitted a certain amount of confusion between laws and trends. But he could have reminded us that he himself had criticized those who mistook a ‘uniformity of historical succession’ for a true law of nature; that he had been careful to emphasize that such a uniformity could ‘only be an empirical law’22 (the term is somewhat misleading); and that it should not be considered secure before it had been reduced, ‘by the consilience of deduction a priori with historical evidence’, to the status of a true law of nature. And he could have reminded us that he had even laid down the ‘imperative rule never to introduce any generalization from history into the social science unless sufficient grounds can be pointed out for it’,23—that is, by deducing it from some true natural laws which can be established independently. (The laws he had in mind were those of ‘human nature’, i.e. psychology.) To this procedure of reducing historical or other generalizations to some set of laws of higher generality, Mill gave the name ‘inverse deductive method’, and he advocated it as the only correct historical and sociological method.

I am ready to admit that there is some force in this rejoinder. For should we succeed in reducing a trend to a set of laws, then we should be justified in using this trend, like a law, as a basis of predictions. Such a reduction, or inverse deduction, would go a long way towards bridging the gulf between laws and trends. The force of this rejoinder is further brought out by the fact that l’s method of ‘inverse deduction’ is a fair (although scrappy) description of a procedure which is used not only in the social sciences but in all sciences, and to an extent far beyond Mill’s own estimate.

In spite of these admissions I believe that my criticism remains correct, and that the fundamental historicist confusion of laws with trends is indefensible. But in order to show this, a careful analysis is needed of the method of reduction or inverse deduction.

Science, we may say, is confronted with problems, at any moment of its development. It cannot start with observations, or with the ‘collection of data’, as some students of method believe. Before we can collect data, our interest in data of a certain kind must be aroused: the problem always comes first. The problem in its turn may be suggested by practical needs, or by scientific or pre-scientific beliefs which, for some reason or other, appear to be in need of revision.

Now a scientific problem, as a rule, arises from the need for an explanation. Following Mill, we shall distinguish between two main cases: the explanation of an individual or singular specific event, and the explanation of some regularity or law. Mill puts it as follows:

An individual fact is said to be explained by pointing out its cause, that is, by stating the law or laws … of which its production is an instance. Thus a conflagration is explained when it is proved to have arisen from a spark falling into a heap of combustibles; and in a similar manner, a law … is said to be explained when another law or laws are pointed out, of which that law itself is but a case and from which it could be deduced.24



The case of the explanation of a law is a case of ‘inverse deduction’, and therefore important in our context.

Mill’s explanation of an explanation, or better of a causal explanation, is in the main quite acceptable. But for certain purposes it is not precise enough; and this lack of precision plays an important part in the issue we are here concerned with. I shall therefore re-state the matter, and point out where the differences between Mill’s view and my own lie.

I suggest that to give a causal explanation of a certain specific event means deducing a statement describing this event from two kinds of premises: from some universal laws, and from some singular or specific statements which we may call the specific initial conditions. For example, we can say that we have given a causal explanation of the breaking of a certain thread if we find that this thread could carry a weight of only one pound, and that a weight of two pounds was put on it. If we analyse this causal explanation, then we find that two different constituents are involved. (1) Some hypotheses of the character of universal laws of nature; in this case, perhaps: ‘For every thread of a given structure s (determined by its material, thickness, etc.) there is a characteristic weight w such that the thread will break if any weight exceeding w is suspended on it’; and ‘For every thread of the structure s1 the characteristic weight w equals one pound’. (2) Some specific (singular) statements—the initial conditions —pertaining to the particular event in question; in this case, we may have two statements: ‘This is a thread of structure s1, and ‘The weight put on this thread was a weight of two pounds’. Thus we have two different constituents, two different kinds of statements which together yield a complete causal explanation: (1) Universal statements of the character of natural laws; and (2) specific statements pertaining to the special case in question, called the ‘initial conditions’. Now from the universal laws (1) we can deduce, with the help of the initial conditions (2), the following specific statement (3): ‘This thread will break’. This conclusion (3) we may also call a specific prognosis. The initial conditions (or more precisely, the situation described by them) are usually spoken of as the cause of the event in question, and the prognosis (or rather, the event described by the prognosis) as the effect; for example, we say that the putting of a weight of two pounds on a thread capable of carrying only one pound was the cause, and the breaking the effect.25

Such a causal explanation will, of course, be scientifically acceptable only if the universal laws are well tested and corroborated, and if we have also some independent evidence in favour of the cause, i.e. of the initial conditions.

Before proceeding to analyse the causal explanation of regularities or laws, it may be remarked that several things emerge from our analysis of the explanation of singular events. One is that we can never speak of cause and effect in an absolute way, but must say that an event is a cause of another event—its effect—in relation to some universal law. However, these universal laws are very often so trivial (as in our example) that as a rule we take them for granted instead of making conscious use of them. A second point is that the use of a theory for predicting some specific event is just another aspect of its use for explaining such an event. And since we test a theory by comparing the events predicted with those actually observed, our analysis also shows how theories can be tested. Whether we use a theory for the purpose of explanation, of prediction, or of testing, depends upon our interest; it depends upon the question which statements we consider as given or unproblematic, and which statements we consider to stand in need of further criticism, and of testing. (See section 29.)

The causal explanation of a regularity, described by a universal law, is somewhat different from that of a singular event. At first sight, one might think that the case is analogous and that the law in question has to be deduced from (1) some more general laws, and (2) certain special conditions which correspond to the initial conditions but which are not singular, and refer to a certain kind of situation. This, however, is not the case here, for the special conditions (2) must be explicitly stated in the formulation of the law which we wish to explain; for otherwise this law would simply contradict (1). (For example, if with the help of Newton’s theory we wish to explain the law that all planets move in ellipses, then we have to put first explicitly in the formulation of this law the conditions under which we can assert its validity, perhaps in the form: If a number of planets, sufficiently spaced to make their mutual attraction very small, move round a very much heavier sun, then each moves approximately in an ellipse with the sun in the one focus.) In other words, the formulation of the universal law which we try to explain has to incorporate all the conditions of its validity, since otherwise we cannot assert it universally (or as Mill says, unconditionally). Accordingly, the causal explanation of a regularity consists in the deduction of a law (containing the conditions under which the regularity asserted holds) from a set of more general laws which have been tested and confirmed independently.

If we now compare our account of causal explanation with Mill’s we see that there is no great difference as far as the reduction of laws to more general laws is concerned, that is to say, in the causal explanation of regularities. But in Mill’s discussion of the causal explanation of singular events, there is no clear distinction between (1) universal laws, and (2) specific initial conditions. This is, largely, due to Mill’s lack of clarity in his use of the term ‘cause’ by which he means sometimes singular events, and sometimes universal laws. We shall now show how this affects the explanation or reduction of trends.

That it is logically possible to reduce or explain trends cannot be doubted. Let us assume, for example, that we find that all planets progressively approach the sun. The solar system would then be a dynamic system in Comte’s sense; it would have a development or a history, with a definite trend. The trend could easily be explained in Newtonian physics by the assumption (for which we might find independent evidence) that inter-planetary space is filled with some resisting matter—for example, a certain gas. This assumption would be a new specific initial condition which we would have to add to the usual initial conditions stating the positions and momenta of the planets at a certain time. As long as the new initial condition persists, we should have a systematic change or trend. Now if we further assume the change to be large, then it must have a very marked systematic influence on the biology and history of the various species on earth, including human history. This shows how we could, in principle, explain certain evolutionary and historical trends— even ‘general trends’, i.e. trends that persist throughout the development under consideration. It is obvious that these trends would be analogous to the quasi-laws of succession (seasonal periodicities, etc.) mentioned in the preceding section, with the difference that they would be ‘dynamic’. They would, therefore, correspond, even more closely than these ‘static’ quasi-laws, to Comte’s and Mill’s vague idea of evolutionary or historical laws of succession. Now if we have reason to assume the persistence of the relevant initial conditions then, clearly, we can assume that these trends or ‘dynamic quasi-laws’ will persist, so that they may be used, like laws, as a basis for predictions.

There is little doubt that such explained trends (as we may call them), or trends which are on the verge of being explained, play a considerable role in modern evolutionary theory. Apart from a number of such trends pertaining to the evolution of certain biological forms such as shells and rhinoceroses, it appears that a general trend towards an increasing number and an increasing variety of biological forms spreading into an increasing range of environmental conditions is becoming explicable in terms of biological laws (together with initial conditions which make certain assumptions regarding the terrestrial environment of organisms and which, together with the laws, imply, for example, the working of the important mechanism called ‘natural selection’).26

All this may appear to tell against us, and indeed to support Mill and historicism. But this is not the case. Explained trends do exist, but their persistence depends on the persistence of certain specific initial conditions (which in turn may sometimes be trends).

Now Mill and his fellow historicists overlook the dependence of trends on initial conditions. They operate with trends as if they were unconditional, like laws. Their confusion of laws with trends27 makes them believe in trends which are unconditional (and therefore general); or, as we may say, in ‘absolute trends’;28 for example, in a general historical tendency towards progress—’a tendency towards a better and happier state’. And if they at all consider a ‘reduction’ of their tendencies to laws, they believe that these tendencies can be immediately derived from universal laws alone, such as the laws of psychology (or perhaps of dialectical materialism, etc.).

This, we may say, is the central mistake of historicism. Its ‘laws of development’ turn out to be absolute trends; trends which, like laws, do not depend on initial conditions, and which carry us irresistibly in a certain direction into the future. They are the basis of unconditional prophecies, as opposed to conditional scientific predictions.

But what about those who see that trends depend on conditions, and who try to find these conditions and to formulate them explicitly? My answer is that I have no quarrel with them. On the contrary: that trends occur cannot be doubted. Therefore we have the difficult task of explaining them as well as we can, i.e. of determining as precisely as possible the conditions under which they persist. (See section 32.)29

The point is that these conditions are so easily overlooked. There is, for example, a trend towards an ‘accumulation of means of production’ (as Marx puts it). But we should hardly expect it to persist in a population which is rapidly decreasing; and such a decrease may in turn depend on extra-economic conditions, for example, on chance inventions, or conceivably on the direct physiological (perhaps biochemical) impact of an industrial environment. There are, indeed, countless possible conditions; and in order to be able to examine these possibilities in our search for the true conditions of a trend, we have all the time to try to imagine conditions under which the trend in question would disappear. But this is just what the historicist cannot do. He firmly believes in his favourite trend, and conditions under which it would disappear are to him unthinkable. The poverty of historicism, we might say, is a poverty of imagination. The historicist continuously upbraids those who cannot imagine a change in their little worlds; yet it seems that the historicist is himself deficient in imagination, for he cannot imagine a change in the conditions of change.
