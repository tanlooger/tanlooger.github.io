title: 27 Is There a Law of Evolution? Laws and Trends
---




The doctrines of historicism which I have called ‘pro-naturalistic’ have much in common with its anti-naturalistic doctrines. They are, for example, influenced by holistic thinking, and they spring from a misunderstanding of the methods of the natural sciences. Since they represent a misguided effort to copy these methods, they may be described as ‘scientistic’ (in Professor Hayek’s sense1). They are just as characteristic of historicism as are its anti-naturalistic doctrines, and perhaps even more important. The belief, more especially, that it is the task of the social sciences to lay bare the law of evolution of society in order to foretell its future (a view expounded in sections 14 to 17, above) might be perhaps described as the central historicist doctrine. For it is this view of a society moving through a series of periods that gives rise, on the one hand, to the contrast between a changing social and an unchanging physical world, and thereby to anti-naturalism. On the other hand, it is the same view that gives rise to the pro-naturalistic—and scientistic—belief in so-called ‘natural laws of succession’; a belief which, in the days of Comte and Mill, could claim to be supported by the long-term predictions of astronomy, and more recently, by Darwinism. Indeed, the recent vogue of historicism might be regarded as merely part of the vogue of evolutionism—a philosophy that owes its influence largely to the somewhat sensational clash between a brilliant scientific hypothesis concerning the history of the various species of animals and plants on earth, and an older metaphysical theory which, incidentally, happened to be part of an established religious belief.2

What we call the evolutionary hypothesis is an explanation of a host of biological and palaeontological observations—for instance, of certain similarities between various species and genera—by the assumption of the common ancestry of related forms.3 This hypothesis is not a universal law, even though certain universal laws of nature, such as laws of heredity, segregation, and mutation, enter with it into the explanation. It has, rather, the character of a particular (singular or specific) historical statement. (It is of the same status as the historical statement: ‘Charles Darwin and Francis Galton had a common grandfather’.) The fact that the evolutionary hypothesis is not a universal law of nature4 but a particular (or, more precisely, singular) historical statement about the ancestry of a number of terrestrial plants and animals is somewhat obscured by the fact that the term ‘hypothesis’ is so often used to characterize the status of universal laws of nature. But we should not forget that we quite frequently use this term in a different sense. For example, it would undoubtedly be correct to describe a tentative medical diagnosis as a hypothesis, even though such a hypothesis is of a singular and historical character rather than of the character of a universal law. In other words, the fact that all laws of nature are hypotheses must not distract our attention from the fact that not all hypotheses are laws, and that more especially historical hypotheses are, as a rule, not universal but singular statements about one individual event, or a number of such events.

But can there be a law of evolution? Can there be a scientific law in the sense intended by T. H. Huxley when he wrote: ‘…he must be a half-hearted philosopher who … doubts that science will sooner or later … become possessed of the law of evolution of organic forms—of the unvarying order of that great chain of causes and effects of which all organic forms, ancient and modern, are the links … ‘?5

I believe that the answer to this question must be ‘No’, and that the search for the law of the ‘unvarying order’ in evolution cannot possibly fall within the scope of scientific method, whether in biology or in sociology. My reasons are very simple. The evolution of life on earth, or of human society, is a unique historical process. Such a process, we may assume, proceeds in accordance with all kinds of causal laws, for example, the laws of mechanics, of chemistry, of heredity and segregation, of natural selection, etc. Its description, however, is not a law, but only a singular historical statement. Universal laws make assertions concerning some unvarying order, as Huxley puts it, i.e. concerning all processes of a certain kind; and although there is no reason why the observation of one single instance should not incite us to formulate a universal law, nor why, if we are lucky, we should not even hit upon the truth, it is clear that any law, formulated in this or in any other way, must be tested by new instances before it can be taken seriously by science. But we cannot hope to test a universal hypothesis nor to find a natural law acceptable to science if we are for ever confined to the observation of one unique process. Nor can the observation of one unique process help us to foresee its future development. The most careful observation of one developing caterpillar will not help us to predict its transformation into a butterfly. As applied to the history of human society—and it is with this that we are mainly concerned here—our argument has been formulated by H. A. L. Fisher in these words: ‘Men … have discerned in history a plot, a rhythm, a predetermined pattern … I can see only one emergency following upon another … only one great fact with respect to which, since it is unique, there can be no generalizations. ….’6

How can this objection be countered? There are, in the main, two positions which may be taken up by those who believe in a law of evolution. They may (a) deny our contention that the evolutionary process is unique; or (b) assert that in an evolutionary process, even if it is unique, we may discern a trend or tendency or direction, and diat we may formulate a hypothesis which states this trend, and test this hypothesis by future experience. The two positions (a) and (b) are not exclusive of each other.

Position (a) goes back to an idea of great antiquity—the idea that the life-cycle of birth, childhood, youth, maturity, old age, and death applies not only to individual animals and plants, but also to societies, races, and perhaps even to ‘the whole world’. This ancient doctrine was used by Plato in his interpretation of the decline and fall of the Greek city states and of the Persian Empire.7 Similar use of it has been made by Machiavelli, Vico, Spengler, and recently by Professor Toynbee in his imposing Study of History. From the point of view of this doctrine, history is repetitive, and the laws of the life-cycle of civilizations, for instance, can be studied in the same way as we study the life-cycle of a certain animal species.8 It is a consequence of this doctrine, although one which its originators hardly intended, that our objection, based on the uniqueness of the evolutionary or historical process, loses its force. Now I do not intend to deny (nor, I feel certain, did Professor Fisher in the passage quoted) that history may sometimes repeat itself in certain respects, nor that the parallel between certain types of historical events, such as the rise of tyrannies in ancient Greece and in modern times, can be significant for the student of the sociology of political power.9 But it is clear that all these instances of repetition involve circumstances which are vastly dissimilar, and which may exert an important influence upon further developments. We have therefore no valid reason to expect of any apparent repetition of a historical development that it will continue to run parallel to its prototype. Admittedly, once we believe in a law of repetitive life-cycles—a belief arrived at by analogical speculations, or perhaps inherited from Plato—we are sure to discover historical confirmation of it nearly everywhere. But this is merely one of the many instances of metaphysical theories seemingly confirmed by facts—facts which, if examined more closely, turn out to be selected in the light of the very theories they are supposed to test.10

Turning to position (b), the belief that we may discern, and extrapolate, the trend or direction of an evolutionary movement, it may first be mentioned that this belief has influenced and has been used to support some of the cyclical hypotheses which represent position (a). Professor Toynbee, for example, expresses in support of position (a) the following views characteristic of (b): ‘Civilizations are not static conditions of society but dynamic movements of an evolutionary kind. They not only cannot stand still, but they cannot reverse their direction without breaking down their own law of motion … ‘.11 Here we have nearly all the elements usually found in statements of position (b): the idea of social dynamics (as opposed to social statics); of evolutionary movements of societies (under the influence of social forces); and of directions (and courses, and velocities) of such movements which, it is said, cannot be reversed without breaking the laws of motion. The terms in italics have all been taken over from physics into sociology, and their adoption has led to a series of misunderstandings which are of an astonishing crudity, but very characteristic of the scientistic misuse of the examples of physics and astronomy. Admittedly, these misunderstandings have done little harm outside the historicist workshop. In economics, for example, the use of the term ‘dynamics’ (cp. the now fashionable term ‘macro-dynamics’) is unobjectionable, as must be admitted even by those who dislike the term. But even this use derives from Comte’s attempt to apply to sociology the physicist’s distinction between statics and dynamics; and there can be no doubt of the gross misunderstanding that underlies this attempt. For the kind of society which the sociologist calls ‘static’ is precisely analogous to those physical systems which the physicist would call ‘dynamic’ (although ‘stationary’). A typical example is the solar system; it is the prototype of a dynamic system in the physicist’s sense; but since it is repetitive (or ‘stationary’), since it does not grow or develop, since it does not show any structural changes (apart from such changes as do not fall within the realm of celestial dynamics and which may therefore be neglected here), it corresponds, undoubtedly, to those social systems which the sociologist would call ‘static’. The point is of considerable importance in connection with the claims of historicism, in so far as the success of the long-term predictions of astronomy depends entirely on this repetitive, and in the sociologist’s sense static, character of the solar system—on the fact that we may here neglect any symptoms of a historical development. It is therefore certainly a mistake to suppose that these dynamical long-term predictions of a stationary system establish the possibility of large-scale historical prophecies of non-stationary social systems.

Very similar misunderstandings are involved in the application to society of the other terms from physics listed above. Often this application is quite harmless. No harm is done, for example, if we describe changes in social organization, in the methods of production, etc., as movements. But we ought to be clear that we are simply using a metaphor, and a rather misleading one at that. For if we speak in physics of the movement of a body or a system of bodies, then we do not intend to imply that the body or system in question undergoes any internal or structural change, but only that it changes its position relative to some (arbitrarily chosen) system of co-ordinates. As opposed to this, the sociologist means by a ‘movement of society’ some structural or internal change. He will, accordingly, assume that a movement of society is to be explained by forces while the physicist assumes that only changes of movement, but not movement as such, have to be so explained.12 The ideas of the speed of a social movement, or of its track, or course, or direction, are similarly harmless as long as they are used merely in order to convey some intuitive impression; but if used with anything like scientific pretensions, they simply become scientistic jargon, or to be more precise, holistic jargon. Admittedly, any kind of change of a measurable social factor—for example, population growth— may be graphically represented as a track, just like the path of a moving body. But it is clear that such a diagram does not depict what people mean by the movement of society—considering that a stationary population may undergo a radical social upheaval. We may, of course, combine any number of such diagrams into one single multi-dimensional representation. But such a combined diagram cannot be said to represent the path of the movement of society; it does not tell us more than do the single ones together; it does not represent any movement of ‘the whole society’, but only changes of selected aspects. The idea of the movement of society itself—the idea that society, like a physical body, can move as a whole along a certain path and in a certain direction—is merely a holistic confusion.13

The hope, more especially, that we may some day find the ‘laws of motion of society’, just as Newton found the laws of motion of physical bodies, is nothing but the result of these misunderstandings. Since there is no motion of society in any sense similar or analogous to the motion of physical bodies, there can be no such laws.

But, it will be said, the existence of trends or tendencies in social change can hardly be questioned: every statistician can calculate such trends. Are these trends not comparable with Newton’s law of inertia? The answer is: trends exist, or more precisely, the assumption of trends is often a useful statistical device. But trends are not laws. A statement asserting the existence of a trend is existential, not universal. (A universal law, on the other hand, does not assert existence; on the contrary: as was shown at the end of section 20, it asserts the impossibility of something or other.14) And a statement asserting the existence of a trend at a certain time and place would be a singular historical statement, not a universal law. The practical significance of this logical situation is considerable: while we may base scientific predictions on laws, we cannot (as every cautious statistician knows) base them merely on the existence of trends. A trend (we may again take population growth as an example) which has persisted for hundreds or even thousands of years may change within a decade, or even more rapidly than that.

It is important to point out that laws and trends are radically different things.15 There is little doubt that the habit of confusing trends with laws, together with the intuitive observation of trends (such as technical progress), inspired the central doctrines of evolutionism and historicism—the doctrines of the inexorable laws of biological evolution and of the irreversible laws of motion of society. And the same confusions and intuitions also inspired Comte’s doctrine of laws of succession—a doctrine which is still very influential.

The distinction, famous since Comte and Mill, between laws of coexistence, alleged to correspond to statics, and laws of succession, alleged to correspond to dynamics, can admittedly be interpreted in a reasonable way; i.e. as a distinction between laws that do not involve the concept of time, and laws into whose formulation time enters (for instance, laws that speak of velocities).16 But this is not quite what Comte and his followers had in mind. When speaking of laws of succession, Comte thought of laws determining the succession of a ‘dynamic’ series of phenomena in the order in which we observe them. Now it is important to realize that ‘dynamic’ laws of succession, as Comte conceived them, do not exist. They certainly do not exist within dynamics. (I mean dynamics.) The closest approach to them in the field of natural science—and what he probably had in mind—are natural periodicities like the seasons, the phases of the moon, the recurrence of eclipses, or perhaps the swings of a pendulum. But these periodicities, which in physics would be described as dynamical (though stationary), would be, in Comte’s sense of these terms, ‘static’ rather than ‘dynamic’; and in any case they can hardly be called laws (since they depend upon the special conditions prevailing in the solar system; see the next section). I will call them ‘quasi-laws of succession’.

The crucial point is this: although we may assume that any actual succession of phenomena proceeds according to the laws of nature, it is important to realize that practically no sequence of, say, three or more causally connected concrete events proceeds according to any single law of nature. If the wind shakes a tree and Newton’s apple falls to the ground, nobody will deny that these events can be described in terms of causal laws. But there is no single law, such as that of gravity, nor even a single definite set of laws, to describe the actual or concrete succession of causally connected events; apart from gravity, we should have to consider the laws explaining wind pressure; the jerking movements of the branch; the tension in the apple’s stalk; the bruise suffered by the apple on impact; all of which is succeeded by chemical processes resulting from the bruise, etc. The idea that any concrete sequence or succession of events (apart from such examples as the movement of a pendulum or a solar system) can be described or explained by any one law, or by any one definite set of laws, is simply mistaken. There are neither laws of succession, nor laws of evolution.

Yet Comte and Mill did envisage their historical laws of succession as laws determining a sequence of historical events in the order of their actual occurrence. This may be seen from the manner in which Mill speaks of a method that

consists in attempting, by a study and analysis of the general facts of history to discover… the law of progress; which law, once ascertained, must… enable us to predict future events, just as after a few terms of an infinite series in algebra we are able to detect the principle of regularity in their formation, and to predict the rest of the series to any number of terms we please.17



Mill himself is critical of this method; but his criticism (see the beginning of section 28) fully admits the possibility of finding laws of succession analogous to those of a mathematical sequence, even though he expressed doubts whether ‘the order of succession … which history presents to us’ may be sufficiently ‘rigidly uniform’ to be compared with a mathematical sequence.18

Now we have seen that there are no laws that determine the succession of such a ‘dynamic’ series of events.19 On the other hand, there may be trends which are of this ‘dynamic’ character; for example, population increase. It may therefore be suspected that Mill had such trends in mind when he spoke of ‘laws of succession’. And this suspicion is confirmed by Mill himself when he describes his historical law of progress as a tendency. Discussing this ‘law’, he expresses his ‘belief.… that the general tendency is, and will continue to be saving occasional and temporary exceptions, one of improvement—a tendency towards a happier and better state. This … is … a theorem of the science’ (viz. of the social science). That Mill should seriously discuss the question whether ‘the phenomena of human society’ revolve ‘in an orbit’ or whether they move, progressively, in ‘a trajectory’20 is in keeping with this fundamental confusion between laws and trends, as well as with the holistic idea that society can ‘move’ as a whole—say, like a planet.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, I wish to make it clear that I believe that both Comte and Mill have made great contributions to the philosophy and methodology of science: I am thinking, especially, of Comte’s emphasis on laws and scientific prediction, of his criticism of an essentialist theory of causality; and of his and Mill’s doctrine of the unity of scientific method. Yet their doctrine of historical laws of succession is, I believe, little better than a collection of misapplied metaphors.21
