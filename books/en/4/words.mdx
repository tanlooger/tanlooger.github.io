1:

filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell

lots of pegs for hats and coats

natural leathery soles

the family hushed it up

the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous

Good gracious me!

diamond studs that fastened themselves

They used to go up like great lilies and snapdragons and laburnums of fire

Mr. Baggins was not quite so prosy as he liked to believe

so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures

life used to be quite inter

I will go so far as to send you on this adventure

the hobbit turned and scuttled inside his round green door

put out another cup and saucer

he knew his duty and stuck to it however painful

after-supper morsel

the depredations of dragons

A big jug of coffee

the dwarves were starting on a round of buttered scones

altogether bewildered and bewuthered

a long silver tassel

Thorin indeed was very haughty

the best detachable party hoods

raspberry jam

mince-pies and cheese

bring out the cold chicken and pickles

Seems to know as much about the inside of my larders as I do myself

who was feeling positively flummoxed

Lo and behold

they had whisked the trays and a couple of small tables into the parlour

We shan’t get through the business till late

Cut the cloth and tread on the fat

Dump the crocks in a boiling bowl

Pound them up with a thumping pole

behind the clock on the mantelpiece

made him look strange and sorcerous

Fili rushed for their bags and brought back little fiddles

came back with clarinets

They came back with viols as big as themselves

with Thorin’s harp wrapped in a green cloth

when Thorin struck it the music began all at once

We must away ere break of day

To seek the pale enchanted gold.

The dwarves of yore made mighty spells

In hollow halls beneath the fells.

They shaped and wrought, and light they caught

Goblets they carved there for themselves

where no man delves

The bells were ringing in the dale

The dragon’s ire more fierce than fire

Laid low their towers and houses frail.

they heard the tramp of doom.

Far over the misty mountains grim

he thought of plundering dragons settling on his quiet Hill and kindling it all to flames.

He shuddered

There are many hours before dawn

this most excellent and audacious hobbit

who was wagging his mouth in protest at being called audacious

knocking over the table

He charged the ranks of the goblins

Bullroarer’s gentler descendant was reviving in the drawing-room.

As soon as I clapped eyes on the little fellow bobbing and puffing on the mat

You asked me to find the fourteenth man for your expedition, and I chose Mr. Baggins.

He scowled so angrily at Gloin that the dwarf huddled back in his chair

he spread a piece of parchment rather like a map.

I know where Mirkwood is, and the Withered Heath where the great dragons bred.

You see that rune on the West side

three may walk abreast

so many of the dwarves and men of Dale

a key with a long barrel and intricate wards

he fastened it upon a fine chain that hung about his neck and under his jacket

said he obstinately

doing his best to appear wise and prudent and professional and live up to Gandalf’s recommendation

time required and remuneration

treated with great reverence by the mortal men

Fathers would beg us to take their sons as apprentices

routed out all the halls, and lanes

singed beards

I will allow we have a good bit laid by and are not so badly off

how Gandalf got hold of it

I found him a prisoner in the dungeons of the Necromancer.

he was so flustered

fried not poached

before he got them all stowed and went to his own little bed very tired and not altogether happy.

2:

Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used

The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped.

feeling just a trifle disappointed

thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age

he put on an apron, lit fires, boiled water, and washed up

funeral expenses to be defrayed by us or our representatives, if occasion arises and the matter is not otherwise arranged for.

Thinking it unnecessary to disturb your esteemed repose

each pony was slung about with all kinds of baggages, packages, parcels, and paraphernalia

Up you two get, and off we go

on laden ponies

a dwarf or a farmer ambling by on business

the roads grew steadily worse

a clump of trees

the mischief seemed to have got into the fire

one of the ponies took fright at nothing and bolted

they all sat glum and wet and muttering

the less inquisitive you are as you go along, the less trouble you are likely to find

with all due and proper caution

they went through the trees in the pitch dark

all this dwarvish racket

the whole cavalcade had passed two feet off

Three very large persons sitting round a very large fire of beech-logs.

long spits of wood

purloined the beer

Bilbo plucked up courage

warming to his new work

wondering how to make owl-noises before they throttled him

there was a gorgeous row

Tom whacked at them both with a branch

his poor little feet had been very squashed in Bert’s big paw

Right in the middle of the fight up came Balin

hoot like an owl,

Trolls simply detest the very sight of dwarves

all this commotion

two with burns and bashes to remember

mince them fine and boil them

You’re a booby

there was a mighty twitter in the branches

Gandalf tried various incantations.

He held out a largish key

there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves

untidy litter of plunder

beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts

Their own provisions were very scanty.

they had bacon to toast in the embers of the fire

they all mounted once more

I was anxious about replenishing our small stock of provisions

they waylaid strangers

they forded a river

we shall be done for

3:

tackle the Misty Mountains by the proper path

a wide land the colour of heather and crumbling rock, with patches and slashes of grass-green and moss-green showing where water might be.

there was no sign of any dwelling

There were gullies that they could almost leap over

There were dark ravines that one could neither jump over nor climb into.

There were bogs

slithered and slipped in the dusk

bumped his nose on the pony’s neck

they came at length to an open glade not far above the banks of the stream.

The faggots are reeking,

The bannocks are baking!

Your ponies are straying

To fly would be folly

And listen and hark

said Thorin a bit gruffly

leading his pony by the bridle

 things that are good to have and days that are good to spend are soon told about

 while things that are uncomfortable, palpitating, and even gruesome, may make a good tale

 as venerable as a king of dwarves

 the swords they had brought from the trolls’ lair

They must have come from a dragon’s hoard or goblin plunder

the Goblin-cleaver in the ancient tongue of Gondolin

Whence did the trolls get them

the remnants of old robberies in some hold in the mountains

Thorin pondered these words

The moon was shining in a broad silver crescent.

a bit vexed perhaps that even Elrond should have found this out first

Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks

they rode away amid songs of farewell and good speed

4:

a crooked way

the wind came shrill among the rocks

Boulders, too, at times came galloping down the mountain-sides

the echoes were uncanny

they had spoken gaily of the passage of the mountains

go astray sometimes when you are off on dangerous adventures over the Edge of the Wild

The lightning splinters on the peaks

great crashes split the air and go rolling and tumbling into every cave and hollow

he peeped out in the lightning-flashes

stone-giants were hurling rocks at one another for a game

Soon they were getting drenched

some of them were whinnying with fright

the giants guffawing and shouting all over the mountainsides

who was feeling very grumpy

being the youngest of the dwarves by some fifty years they usually got these sort of jobs

it was good to hear the wind and the rain outside instead of all about them

It had a dry floor and some comfortable nooks

champing in their nosebags

before you could say tinder and flint

it was most horribly stuffy

The goblins began to sing, or croak, keeping time with the flap of their flat feet on the stone

Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs

whipped them with a swish

more than one of the dwarves were already yammering and bleating like anything, when they stumbled into a big cavern.

the goblin-drivers whooped and cracked their whips behind.

It was lit by a great red fire

being rummaged by goblins

with little Bilbo tugging at the end of the row.

not working with their own hands more than they could help

they had a special grudge against Thorin’s people

nothing was further from our thoughts than inconveniencing goblins in any way whatever

Not that it will do you much good

all his soldiers gnashed their teeth, clashed their shields, and stamped.

shrieking and skriking

Bilbo saw it go right through the Great Goblin as he stood dumbfounded in the middle of his rage

He made the hobbit scramble on his shoulders as best he could with his tied hands

It burned with a rage that made it gleam if goblins were about

it was bright as blue flame for delight in the killing of the great lord of the cave.

snatching it from one of the terrified guards

hordes of angry goblins just behind

do what they could

They came scurrying round the corner in full cry, and found Goblin-cleaver, and Foe-hammer shining cold and bright right in their astonished eyes.

ran silently up behind

bumped his head on hard rock

5:

groped about on all fours

he was far from certain even of the direction they had been going in when he had his fall

gave himself up to complete miserableness

he could feel inside that it was high time for some meal or other

they have a fund of wisdom and wise sayings that men have mostly never heard or have forgotten long ago.

I should not have liked to have been in Mr. Baggins’ place, all the same

There were passages leading off to the side every now and then

It seemed like all the way to tomorrow and over it to the days beyond.

he did not dare to wade out into the darkness

a tasty morsel

Sun on the daisies it means

A box without hinges, key, or lid

it proved a nasty poser for Gollum

All in mail never clinking.

Is it scrumptiously crunchable

put his long webby foot in the water

all the giants and ogres he had ever heard told of in tales

came out with a sudden squeal

he even felt in his pocket with his other hand

the riddle-game was sacred and of immense antiquity

he kept a few wretched oddments

till it galled him

Gollum was cursing and wailing away in the gloom

Gollum had brooded for ages on this one thing

he saw that all was up

it quietly slipped on to his groping forefinger.

he struck his toes on a snag in the floor

we twisted that nassty young squeaker

the nassty nosey thing

shambling off at a great pace

his chief fear now was of tripping on another snag and falling with a noise

There was Gollum sitting humped up right in the opening

He hissed softly but menacingly.

He seemed to be crouched right down with his flat hands splayed on the floor

All at once there came a blood-curdling shriek

go along at a great speed stooping low with their hands almost on the ground.

like an echo of Gollum’s misery, smote Bilbo

ran hither and thither

avoid being bumped into, trampled to death

It was still ajar, but a goblin had pushed it nearly to

His buttons had got wedged on the edge of the door and the door-post

bewildered goblins were still picking up his nice brass buttons on the doorstep

hooting and hallooing, and hunting among the trees.

it makes their legs wobble and their heads giddy

6:

He was on a stony path winding downwards

there were dells below the level of the path overhung with bushes and low trees.

it was Balin doing look-out

If we have got to go back now into those abominable tunnels to look for him, then drat him

Whatever did you want to go and drop him for

we had dashed through the gate-guards

helter-skelter down here

shuddered most appreciatively at his description of Gollum

they often caught people benighted near their gates

it had been found quite safe up to now

he had nipped inside the crack

A very ticklish business

it will give us a little light to steer by

he said in answer to more questions from the hobbit

since the night before the night before last

we must just tighten our belts and trudge on

not even hawthorn-berries

He nibbled a bit of sorrel

the patches of rabbit-cropped turf

the thyme and the sage and the marjoram

they found themselves at the top of a wide steep slope of fallen stones, the remains of a landslide

in a fearful confusion of slipping, rattling, cracking slabs and stones.

They slid into the edge of a climbing wood of pines that here stood right up the mountain slope from the deeper darker forests of the valleys below.

some got behind a tree to shelter from the onslaught of the rocks.

the last faint crashes could be heard as the largest of the disturbed stones went bounding and spinning among the bracken and the pine-roots far below.

that has got us on a bit

the shadows were deepening about them

over the black tops of those growing lower down

They limped along now as fast as they were able down the gentle slopes of a pine forest in a slanting path leading steadily southwards.

At times they were pushing through a sea of bracken with tall fronds rising right above the hobbit’s head

used to imitate it to frighten him

smell keener than goblins

the edge of the glade

hunting for those that had branches fairly low, or were slender enough to swarm up.

like old gentlemen gone cracked and playing at being boys.

at the top of a tall larch

a huge pine with regular branches sticking out at intervals like the spokes of a wheel

Dwalin and Balin had swarmed up a tall slender fir with few branches and were trying to find a place to sit in the greenery of the topmost boughs.

their dreadful clamour almost made the hobbit fall out of his pine-tree.

In spite of the dangers of this far land bold men had of late been making their way back into it from the South

All the same he was not going to let them have it all their own way

he was leaping to and fro yelping horribly

the commotion they made filled all the forest.

while those that were burning were running about howling and setting others alight

on the top of a lonely pinnacle of rock

he could see the glint of the moon on goblin spears and helmets

could not reach their lofty seats

clashed the shafts against their shields

Some stacked fern and brushwood round the tree-trunks

round a midsummer bonfire

Shrivel and scorch! A fizzling torch

in cinders lie

The sudden splendour flashed from his wand like lightning

he came hurtling down like a thunderbolt

seized him in his talons

smote them to the floor

Dori was borne off last of all

they went together above the tumult and the burning

clinging onto Dori’s ankles

He used to turn queer if he looked over the edge of quite a little cliff

lest he fall off that narrow place into the deep shadows

Not a bit like storks—forks

There was no path down on to it save by flying

no path down off it except by jumping over a precipice

They would shoot at us with their great bows of yew

We are already deeply obliged to you.

they had brought rabbits, hares, and a small sheep

Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock

had lost their tinder-boxes

Later on you might have seen a bright fire on the shelf of rock

trees that looked like oaks and elms

a well worn path

across which a ford of huge flat stones led to the grass-land beyond the stream. 

a wholesome one with a pebbly floor

your present plight

Very few people live in these parts, unless they have come here since I was last down this way

down the lines of the wide-armed oaks

He can be appalling when he is angry

a furrier, a man that calls rabbits conies

he is under no enchantment but his own

Up slope and down dale they plodded

waving patches of cockscomb clover

They were bigger than hornets

We are on the edge of his bee-pastures

some thatched and made of unshaped logs

Some horses, very sleek and well-groomed

they galloped to the buildings

lying a great oak-trunk with many lopped branches beside it

stooping down to frown at the hobbit with his bushy black eyebrows.

a hobbit of good family and unimpeachable reputation

the smoke was rising to the blackened rafters

into a sort of veranda propped on wooden posts

filled with the light of the westering sun which slanted into it

sat flop on the floor

Beorn did not show it more than he could help, but really he had begun to get very interested

the story had kept him from sending the dwarves off at once like suspicious beggars

By the time the wizard had finished his tale

stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central hearth

The dogs could stand on their hind-legs

they got out boards and trestles

led by a large coal-black ram

bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals

lay outstretched far to North and South a day’s ride before them, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood.

it was the worst of the perils

Beorn seemed to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them

the making of things by smith-craft

and few save the knives were made of metal at all.

wooden drinking-bowls filled with mead

Some of the verses were like this:

The wind was on the withered heath

and leaves were laid upon the mould.

but shrill and harsh across the marsh

The grasses hissed, their tassels bent,

the reeds were rattling—on it went

there black and dark lay boulders stark

The moon set sail upon the gale,

He snuggled into them very gladly

some great animal scuffling at the door

with masses of butter and honey and clotted cream

a quart of mead

you would take the word of no one that you did not know as well as your brother or better

he would lade them with food

red earthenware pots of honey

their spirits sank at his grave words

they mounted the steeds

led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been lost

scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off

Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass

they were so eager to press on

As the light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same direction.

a silence began to draw in upon them

they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood

Their trunks were huge and gnarled

had this all out

Bilbo thought his lot was wearisomely heavy

did not at all like the idea of trudging for miles and miles

they trotted gaily

shambled off quickly after them.

Very comforting you are to be sure

Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight

8:

They walked in single file

hung with lichen to bear more than a few blackened leaves

their feet seemed to thump along

he could catch glimpses of them whisking off the path and scuttling behind tree-trunks

longed for the feel of wind on their faces

horrible pale bulbous sort of eyes

Bilbo’s sharp inquisitive eyes

There were queer noises too, grunts, scufflings, and hurryings in the undergrowth

dark dense cobwebs with threads extraordinarily thick

as heartily as

it was everlastingly still and dark and stuffy

The rope went taut

with a piece of stick fended off the little black boat as it came rushing across the stream

looking at the snapped painter that was still dangling from it

There aren’t any oars

a dreadful wail from Bilbo put all thoughts of venison out of their minds

when the hart bore down on him

toppled back into the dark water

lamenting the loss of the boat

the sound as of dogs baying far off

a hind and fawns as snowy white as the hart had been dark

it sounded eerie and strange

they hoisted him up into the lowest branches of an enormous oak

he was greened and grimed from the old bark of the greater boughs

They did not care tuppence about the butterflies

they were also parchingly thirsty

you cannot quench a terrible thirst by standing under giant oaks and waiting for a chance drip to fall on your tongue

hoist their empty sacks and packs

blundering frantically in the gloom

their faces and their songs were filled with mirth

wind its abominable threads round and round him

he trembled with fear lest they should discover him

He could not get up at the brutes

After that there was a deal of commotion in the spider-colony

He slashed the threads to pieces

full of froth and rage

the wretched dwarf would tumble thump to the ground a good way below

Wriggling along the branch

just like one of those funny toys bobbing on a wire.

the whacking of sticks and the throwing of stones

they were wary

they took ever more and more to the gloaming and the dusk

the fortress of his people against their enemies

his hoard was rich

In a great hall with pillars hewn out of the living stone

if Bilbo was very nimble, he could slip out just behind them

in spite of their plight

a portcullis could be dropped right to the bed of the river

to a place far down the river where the bank jutted out

the king’s butler bidding the chief of the guards good-night

they entered a small cellar and sat down at a table on which two large flagons were set

It must be potent wine to make a wood-elf drowsy

the heady vintage of the great gardens of Dorwinion

At last twelve dwarves were stowed

made a great fuss about his air-holes and said he was stifling

No need to wake the turnkey yonder

You have stacked some full casks here instead of the empty ones

thudding on top of ones below

jostling against the walls of the tunnel

Back to pasture, back to mead,

Where the kine and oxen feed!

at last the jostling crowd began to break up and swing off

managed to get astride his barrel

the eddying current carried several barrels close ashore

without bridle or stirrups

a few went on to bump against the stony pier

not merely politely interested in the dainties of a well-filled larder

that appealed to him with his dripping and ragged clothes clinging to him cold and clammy.

he began to snivel

there was a fine commotion in the village by the riverside

without being noticed in the general bustle

10:

there loomed the Mountain

the tumbled land that joined it to them could not be seen

of the bickerings of the Lake-men and the Wood-elves about the upkeep of the Forest River and the care of the banks

which some were inclined to attribute to the dragon—alluding to him chiefly with a curse and an ominous nod in the direction of the Mountain

feet were piled with shingles

protected from the swirl of the entering river by a promontory of rock which formed a calm bay

There it was moored not far from the shoreward head of the great bridge

take some of the casks away

Wet straw was in his draggled beard

so bruised and buffeted

dirty and tattered sky-blue hood

In the darkness floundering in the cold water

they were so soaked and bruised and cramped that they could hardly yet realize their release or be properly thankful for it.

Except for occasional squabbles about river-tolls

laughed at the greybeards and gammers

long wooden quays

wandering vagabond dwarves that could not give any good account of themselves, sneaking through the woods and molesting our people

we were wrongfully waylaid by the Elvenking

But lock nor bar may hinder the homecoming spoken of old

the Master wished for no enmity with him

giving his mind to trade and tolls

The quays were thronged with hurrying feet

The lord of silver fountains

no songs had alluded to him even in the obscurest way

fed and housed and pampered in the most delightful and satisfactory fashion

his speeches at banquets

11:

they drew in to the left or western bank and disembarked

all the land was desolate and empty

slanting away from the River Running

It was a weary journey, and a quiet and stealthy one

died away to a plodding gloom

The land about them grew bleak and barren

they were come at the waning of the year.

the western side of the great southern spur

the dark cavernous opening in a great cliff-wall

They were alone in the perilous waste without hope of further help

On this western side there were fewer signs of the dragon’s marauding feet, and there was some grass for their ponies.

day by day they toiled in parties searching for paths up the mountain-side.

scrambled among the tumbled rocks

they went in single file along the ledge

as smooth and upright as masons’ work

without a joint or crevice to be seen

No sign was there of post or lintel or threshold

at last without mishap they reached the little grassy bay.

I should turn dizzy and tread on my beard

Out up there a silence reigned, broken by no bird or sound except that of the wind in the crannies of stone.

They spoke low and never called or sang, for danger brooded in every rock

the handles splintered and jarred their arms cruelly

glummer and glummer they became

some were roving about the mountain-side

There on the grey stone in the grass was an enormous thrush

a finger through a rent

A flake of rock split from the wall and fell.

trembling lest the chance should fade

as if darkness flowed out like a vapour

our esteemed Mr. Baggins

made no pretence of offering

ome are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots

Wisps of vapour floated up and past him and he began to sweat.

A sound, too, began to throb in his ears

a large pot galloping on the fire

mixed with a rumble as of a gigantic tom-cat purring.

a thrumming came from his jaws and nostrils, and wisps of smoke, but his fires were low in slumber. 

lay countless piles of precious things, gold wrought and unwrought, gems and jewels, and silver red-stained in the ruddy light.

Bilbo had heard tell and sing of dragon-hoards before

a dire menace even in his sleep

toiled back up the long tunnel

a bellowing and a trampling that made the ground beneath them tremble.

their confident boasts

Could there be a draught from that little hole?

His fire belched forth, the hall smoked

he had caught the thief and had torn and trampled him

he soared blazing into the air

cringing under boulders

Roused by these words

Smaug’s anger were echoing in the stony hollows far above

near the perilous cliff’s edge hauling madly on the ropes.

His hot breath shrivelled the grass

unless any one fancies tramping the long open miles back to the river with Smaug on the watch

it was warm and stuffy

had scaled the mountain-side from the valley

the door withstood his searching eye

as is the nature of folk that are thoroughly perplexed, they began to grumble at the hobbit

trot back with the whole hoard

replenish our supplies

he known more about dragons and their wily ways

a whiff of unseen steam

under the drooping lid of Smaug’s left eye

the Chiefest and Greatest of Calamities

“Lovely titles!” sneered the dragon.

“These don’t sound so creditable,” scoffed Smaug.

they are skulking outside

Whenever Smaug’s roving eye, seeking for him in the shadows

he was in grievous danger

Not gold alone brought us hither.

What about armed guards and tolls?

he gloated

doubtless one so fortified has thought of that.

Your information is antiquated

it became a favourite saying of his later, and passed into a proverb

it had all been singed and frizzled right down to the skin

Drat the bird

they all began discussing dragon-slayings historical, dubious, and mythical

his foreboding grew.

coats of mail gilded and silvered and impenetrable

a globe with a thousand facets

I fear that dragon in my marrow.

the stone that wedged the door.

a blow smote the side of the Mountain

they heard the roar and rumble of Smaug’s fury.

their little lofty camping ground

all disappeared in a jumble of smithereens

an avalanche of splintered stones fell over the cliff into the valley below.

in silent stealth




13:

they made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly

rolled headlong into the hall

Confound you, Smaug, you worm

began to stamp on the floor

holding his tiny light aloft

they caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing

they saw him halt and stoop for a moment

Slowly it grew to a little globe of pallid light

it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many colours at the surface

The mere fleeting glimpses of treasure

The dark hall was filled with a melody

clad in a coat of gold-plated rings

a silver-hafted axe in a belt crusted with scarlet stones.

studded about the brim with white gems

a good many of these precious goblets

we have tempted luck too long

they passed through the gaping doors, not without many a backward glance of longing.

all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed

all was befouled and blasted with the comings and goings of the monster

only furtive shadows that fled from the approach of their torches fluttering in the draughts.

Skulls and bones were upon the floor among flagons and bowls and broken drinking-horns and dust.

wide enough for many men abreast

A whirl of bats frightened from slumber

their feet slithered on stones

their feet slithered on stones rubbed smooth and slimed by the passing of the dragon

they trudged among the stones

they forded the water without much difficulty

It scrambled steeply up, and they plodded slowly one behind the other

In all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was Smaug?

14.

walking on the quays

blotted in the dark

marauding fire of the Dragon

You are always foreboding gloomy things

warning trumpets were suddenly sounded

swept towards the bridges and was foiled

it would quench him before he could pass through.

At the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the trumpets

ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the Master to order them to fight to the last arrow.

Fire leaped from thatched roofs and wooden beam-ends as he hurtled down and past and round again

Flames unquenchable sprang high into the night.

still no arrow hindered Smaug or hurt him more than a fly from the marshes.

huddled into laden boats in the market-pool

the old songs of mirth

great gilded boat

wither every field and pasture

he shot with a great yew bow

The great bow twanged

In it smote and vanished, barb, shaft and feather, so fierce was its flight.

Smaug shot spouting into the air

His last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes.

lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses

Dale is now freed by his valour, and nothing hinders his return.

said the Master warily

He has tonight earned an eminent place in the roll of the benefactors of our town

For what fault am I to be deposed?

Who aroused the dragon from his slumber

Who obtained of us rich gifts and ample help

whom should we claim the recompense of our damage

the fabled treasure

the Master scowled at his back as he went

Shelters could be contrived for few

Very great indeed was the commotion among all things with wings that dwelt on the borders of the Desolation of the Dragon.

the treacherous lands

busied themselves felling trees, and collecting the timber sent down from the Forest

wheeling and crying unceasingly above

there are starlings and flocks of finches

there are many carrion birds as if a battle were afoot

were rewarded with such bright things as they coveted to hide in their dwellings

with him came a most decrepit old bird

He alighted stiffly on the ground before them

bobbed towards Thorin

began to caper about for joy

many are gathering hither beside the birds

thirteen is small remnant of the great folk of Durin

tell them of our plight

contrived a small low arch under the new wall

a wall of new-hewn stone

they caught faintly the fragrance of woodland flowers blossoming in spring

Bilbo longed to escape from the dark fortress

there is matter for a parley and a council

paid to our kindred

Begone now ere our arrows fly!

he has succoured the people of the Lake in their need

as his sires had of old

I will be avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds it.

wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as a pillow

I fear lest there be battle in the valley

they are not likely to overcome the host that besets you

deduct what is right from the total
