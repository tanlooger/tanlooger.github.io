A RETROSPECTIVE FICTION CHECKLIST



AS OF 31 DECEMBER 2006

BY LESLIE KAY SWIGART

University Library, California State University, Long Beach

This checklist of the professionally published fiction of George R. R. Martin, now in its second published version, is part of a much larger project which eventually will be as complete and thorough a bibliography of the work by, and about, George R. R. Martin as may be created by diligence, persistence, and sheer dogged research. In this future bibliography I hope to provide meticulously detailed bibliographic descriptions of all known editions, versions, adaptations, and translations of all books, scripts, short fiction, and nonfiction by Mr. Martin, as well as an annotated bibliography of all known reviews, interviews, articles, and biographical works about Mr. Martin and his work.

The focus of this more modest listing is on the first English-language professional print publications of his books, books he has edited, scripts, and his short fiction. For the books, only the first American and British English language editions are presented, with no attempt to track the reprints of these or other editions. There are several foreign-language volumes with no English-language equivalent; these volumes are not listed here. The short fiction and scripts are listed chronologically by year, then alphabetically by title, with the first publication or first air dates given, along with appearances in his collection. Pre-professional publication is noted only when the item is later reprinted professionally. For all items there is a note of those foreign languages and other formats into which they are known to have been translated.

This project began, although I was then unaware of it, one late June weekend in 1973 in Dallas, Texas. I was attending D-Con ’73, a comics-and science fiction-oriented convention, as the author of Harlan Ellison: A Bibliographical Checklist, which was being published that weekend by the convention chairman, Joe Bob Williams, in honor of the con’s guest of honor, Harlan Ellison. In attendance at the con were a group of young writers, most of whom knew each other through their SF or comics connections. Among these writers were Howard Waldrop, Steve Utley, Lisa Tuttle, and George R. R. Martin.

As far as any evidence exists, I next ran into George at the Science Fiction Writers of America’s Nebula Awards weekend in spring 1974 where George took a photo of a very young and startled-looking me, a photo which I still have. By DisCon II (32nd World Science Fiction Convention, Washington, D.C., 1974), our acquaintance was off and running (quite literally!). Over the years there have been many conversations, mail and email exchanged, and meals shared as well as the occasional convention.

After a while, as George’s writing career continued to prosper there were thoughts and desultory discussions about my doing a bibliography of George’s work along the lines of the one I’d done on Ellison. Then, while attending a party at ConJosé (60th World SF Convention, San Jose, California) in 2002, George asked me if I’d be interested in doing a modest bibliography for the collection of his work that was being proposed for publication in time for his Guest of Honor gig at Torcon III (61st World SF Convention in Toronto) the following year. If so, he would broach the subject with his publisher, William Schafer of Subterranean Press. Then, in late September an email arrived with the subject line of “wanna do my bibliography?” Schafer was interested. Emails were exchanged. Et voilà! This second updated version was prompted by this Bantam publication of Dreamsongs, Volume I and II (previously published as GRRM: A RRetrospective).
