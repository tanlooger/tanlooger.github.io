Becker was the second speaker on the program. So he waited patiently.

The man who preceded him was a doctor, the head of some sort of charity clinic in one of the undercities. Tall, gaunt, and elderly, he spoke in a droning monotone, and kept running his fingers nervously through his sparse gray hair. The audience, some thirty-odd plump upperlevel matrons, was trying hard to pay attention, but Becker could sense their restlessness.

He didn’t blame them. The presentation wasn’t very effective. The doctor was telling medical horror stories, of undercity kids too poor to get decent hospital care, of needless deaths, and of long-cured diseases that still flourished down below. But his voice and his manner drained the punch from his words. And his slides, as well as being of the old-fashioned flat kind, were woefully ill chosen. Instead of moving; photos of sick kids and undercity squalor, there were tedious pictures of the clinic and its staff, and then even blueprints of the proposed expansion.

Becker fought to stifle his own yawns. He felt a little bit sorry for the doctor. But only a little bit. Mostly he was still feeling sorry for himself.

Finally the doctor concluded his presentation with a halting, self-conscious plea for funds. The ladies gave him a round of polite applause. Then the chairwoman turned to Becker. “Any time you’re ready to begin, Commander,” she said pleasantly.

Becker rose from his contour chair and flashed a plastic smile. “Thank you,” he said, as he made his way to the front of the plushly furnished living room. He waited a moment while the doctor cleared the old slide projector from the speaker’s table, then swung up his portable holocaster to take its place. “You can take down the screen, ladies,” he said. “My machine doesn’t need it. And clear a circle around—oh—there.” He pointed.

The women hastened to comply. Becker watched them and smiled at them. But inside, as usual, he felt only a vague distaste for the whole thing.

Even in the darkened living room, he cut a much more imposing figure than the doctor, and he knew it. He was big but and broad of shoulder, and the soft gray uniform he wore hinted at his athletic build. He had a classic profile, a decisive chin, and thick black hair with just a touch of gray at the temples. And his steel-blue eyes were perfectly matched by the leather of his boots and belt, and the scarf that was casually knotted about his neck, under the open collar.

He looked very much like a SPACE recruiting poster. Of late, he’d regretted that. There were times, in recent years, when he’d have given anything for a hook nose, or a weak chin, or a receding hairline.

The holocaster was set up and humming, and the audience was waiting. Becker pushed his thoughts aside and thumbed the first slide.

In the circle the women had cleared, a cube of deeper darkness appeared. Darkness touched by stars. In one corner of the cube, Earth floated in silent blue-green majesty. But the Center of the holograph was occupied by the ship. A fat silver cigar with a pot belly. Or a pregnant torpedo. There were many ways to describe it, and most of them had been used at one time or other.

Appreciative murmurs sounded from the audience. The holoslide was very real, and very striking. Becker, smiling, began smoothly. “This is the Starwind, one of the four SPACE starcruisers. The cruisers are stellar exploration ships, each with a crew of more than a hundred. Antispace jump-generators give them speeds many times that of light. These four frail ships, even as I speak, are carrying out the destiny of our race, and making man’s age-old dream a reality. They are giving man the stars.”

A practiced note of warm fondness crept into his voice, and he gestured at the silver shape afloat in the cube of black. “The Starwind was my ship,” he said. “I was one small member of its crew during its last voyage. The slides you are about to see were taken during that voyage, a voyage that must rank among the most eventful in history. At least I’d say so.” He smiled. “But then, I’m prejudiced.”

His voice went on, detailing the size, design, and capabilities of the starcruiser and its crew. But he never got too technical, and there were always human touches and even hints of poetry to spice the presentation. Becker was too good at his job to bore his audience.

But even as his tongue went through its familiar paces, his mind was elsewhere. Out with the Starwind, in the sunless void of antispace. Out among the stars.

Where is she now? he thought. It’s been almost a year now since she left. On this new trip. Without me. God knows what new worlds they’ve found while I’m stuck back here, feeding slick crap to little old ladies.

And there was an old bitterness to his thoughts, and an old longing in his stomach. And he grew aware, for the millionth time, of how much he hated what his life had become. But no hint of that crept into his smooth and warm and very professional speech.

He thumbed the holocaster, and the slide changed. Now the cube was blinding white, flecked with pits of pulsing black. And in the center of the projection was a thing that looked like a floating black octopus with glowing crimson veins.

“This is antispace,” Becker said simply. “Or at least, this is how human eyes perceive antispace. The mathematicians are still trying to figure out its true nature. But when our jump-generators are on, this is how we see it. Almost like a photographic negative: white darkness, and sparkling black stars.”

He paused, waiting for the inevitable question. And, as always, it came. “Commander,” one of the women said, “what’s that—that thing in the middle?”

He smiled. “You’re not the only one who’d like to know,” he said. “Whatever it is, it has no counterpart in normal space. Or at least, none that we can see. But it and things like it have been sighted several times by starcruisers in antispace. This slide, taken by the Starwind on its last voyage, is the best picture we’ve ever gotten of one. The creature—if it is a creature, which is still only a guess—is larger than a ship. By a good deal. But it seems to be harmless.”

His voice was reassuring. His mind wondered. Seems to be harmless, he thought. Yeah. But this one seemed to be after the ship. There are still arguments about whether it could have done anything if it caught us. Maybe this time it did: Maybe it got them this trip. I always said it was possible. Although the brass doesn’t like to admit it. They’re afraid that there’ll be more budget cuts if they admit the program is dangerous. So they pretend that everything is safe and sane and bland out there, just like Earth. But it isn’t. It isn’t. Earth died of dullness years ago. Out there a man can still live, and feel, and dream.

He finished his spiel on antispace. His thumb moved. The cube of white vanished. Instead, a huge red globe burned in the center of the room.

“The Starwind’s first stop was this red giant, still unnamed,” Becker told the women. “The crew nicknamed it Red Light. Because it stopped us. And because it is a red light, rather obviously. There were no planets, but we circled this star for a month, taking readings and sending in probes. The information we gathered should tell us a lot about stellar evolution.”

I remember the first time I saw it, he was thinking as he spoke. God! What a sight! My first star—Sol doesn’t count. Wilson was on watch with me, but he was so damned busy taking readings he hardly bothered to look. Yet now he’s out there again. And I’m here. There’s no justice. . . .

A new slide. This time a mottled globe of orange and blue floated in the cube. Behind it, a bright yellow sun only slightly smaller than Sol.

Becker’s voice became solemn. “Our first planetfall,” he said. “And one of the greatest moments in human history. That is the planet we named Anthill. I’m sure you’ve read all about it by now, and seen the holoshows. But remember, for us it was new and strange and unexpected. This was humanity’s first contact with another sentient race.”

He thumbed for the next slide, one of the big ones. And when it flashed into view, there were the expected gasps of awe and admiration. The audience held its collective breath.

There was a vast, dark plain in the center of the cube, under a blood-red sky where scuttling black clouds obscured the alien sun. And rising from the plain, the towers. Thin and black and twining, twisting around each other, branching together and splitting again as they rose. They rose for nearly a mile, and all around them were the fragile weblike bridges that linked each to its brothers to make an intricate whole. A river ran through the middle of the city, and gave a clue to the vast size of the structure.

“One of their cities,” Becker said. And the slight note of awe in his voice was real. “The home of more than a million of them, by our estimate. We called the builders Spiderants. Because there was something of the spider web in the cities that they built. And because—well, look.”

The city vanished. The new slide was a close-up. A thick black strand looping through the cube. From it hung what looked like a four-foot-long ant. But appearances were deceiving.

There were a few murmurs of revulsion, even though most of the audience had probably seen photos before. Becker quelled them quickly. “Don’t be fooled,” he cautioned. “Despite what your eyes tell you, that’s not a big ant. It’s not even an insect. No exoskeleton, for example, although it looks like one at first glance. And that bug, we think, is quite intelligent. Their culture is very different from ours. But they have their own sense of beauty. Look at their city again.”

He touched his holocaster. The hanging Spiderant vanished, and again the towers rose amid the carpet. The same angle. But this time, night. And it made a difference.

For the towers glowed.

Black in the reddish daylight, now they shone with a soft green light. A gorgeous glowing tracery against the darkness, they rose and rose and twisted, and every loop and web had a soft radiance all its own. Unbelievably intricate.

Becker, despite himself, still shivered at the slide. As they had shivered the first time he had seen it. In person. The holo woke dreams and memories, and made him hate his reality all the more.

They’ve taken this away from me, he thought. Forever. And given me—what? Nothing. Nothing I want, anyway.

But he said only, “And when the dawn comes . . .” And the slide changed.

Now a reddish-yellow glow suffused the horizon behind the city, and the radiance of the towers was paler and dying. But something new, and just as awesome, had been added. For now the web of the city was aswarm with life. From each branch and strand and loop, Spiderants hung. Dangling even from the highest towers, nearly a mile above the ground. Clustered together, crawling over each other, yet somehow orderly. The whole city.

“They do this every dawn,” Becker said. “And as their sun rises, they sing to it.”

If you can call it song, he thought. To my ears, that first night outside the landing craft, it was moaning. But weird. Rising and falling, up and down, for hours and hours. Even Wilson was awestruck. A million beings moaning together, moaning a hymn to their sun.

His thumb flicked down and up, and suddenly they were looking at a close-up of a web strand, laden heavily with Spiderants. Then it moved once more, and there was another view of the city. And after a while still another, and another. And all the time his voice went on, telling of this curious race and the little they had learned about it.

“The Starwind lay off Anthill for more than six months, sending down landing craft regularly,” he said. “But the Spiderants are yet a race of unanswered questions. We still have not cracked their language, or determined how intelligent they really are. They seem to have no technology, as we know it. But they have—well—something else.”

More views of the city came and went. And then of other, like cities. And some not so like—one that rose from the planet’s brackish sea, and another where the towers jutted sideways to join two mountains in a twisted embrace.

“We had been there nearly a month before we were allowed up in the towers,” Becker continued. “And even then it took us a while before we realized that the cities of the Spiderants were not built, but grown. Those towers are not buildings at all. They are plants: huge, incredibly hardy, incredibly complex. But, for all that, plants.”

Lawrence was the first one to find that out, he remembered. He was so damned excited when he got back that he was incoherent. But he had a right to be. It was our first clue. Before that, nothing made sense. Mile-high towers without machines were especially nonsensical. At least I thought so. Hell. I wonder where Lawrence is now.

“When we discovered that, we began to wonder whether the Spiderants were intelligent after all. We got our answer when we branched out from the original landing site. This was one of the things we saw.”

Red-black gloom suddenly filled the cube. Through it flapped something huge and green and triangular. Airborne and manta-like, with a long tail that split in half over and over again until it was a trail of thin, whiplike tendrils.

Far below it, a city. On top, Spiderants.

“This is a domesticated flying creature, almost as big as a jet. It has to stay low, of course. And it doesn’t have anything like an airplane’s speed. But then, it doesn’t pollute, either. And it gets around.”

We got around faster, though, he thought. I remember that afternoon I trailed one with a flyer. God, but those things are slow. Still, sort of majestic. And when those incredible wings flap with that funny rippling motion, it’s something to see. Of course, that ass Donway had to try buzzing it. At least he’s down, too. I couldn’t stand it if he had gone out again.

“What it is, of course,” he was saying, “is another plant. A mobile, flying plant. When it’s not transporting Spiderants, it flies up high to catch the sun. And it takes in nourishment through that tail structure, which is actually a root of sorts. A lot more complicated than anything any Earth plant has, of course.”

He went through several more slides, showing other mantas, and then several of them in formation. “We think that these things were bred deliberately by the Spiderants. As were the towers. If the theory is right, then we’ve stumbled across the greatest biological engineers you could ever want. There’s a lot to be learned from them, if we can crack the communications barrier. Anthill will be a regular stop for our starcruisers from now on.”

Including the Starwind, of course. She was scheduled visit there again this mission. Maybe she’s there now. Maybe Lawrence and Wilson and the rest are listening to the Spiderants right this moment. While I talk. Or sing. My performance doesn’t much compare to theirs.

He paused. “We spent more than six months on Anthill and had to cut out much of our scheduled mission because of the overstay. But I think you’ll agree that it was worth it” with a smile, and the ladies in the audience mumbled agreement. “Finally, however, we had to move on. There was still time for one more stop before we turned around and began to jump for home.”

He hit the button, and the last view of Anthill died. The holo that was born in its stead was spectacular. The matrons greeted it with gasps. They’d seen it before, on magazine covers and news broadcasts. But the holoslide captured more, much more.

“The world we called Storm,” Becker said. Very softly. And then fell silent while they looked.

A surly green sea was wrestling the wind. From it rose the volcano: a trident in bluish-black stone whose triple peaks dripped fire. Smoke whipped up to mix with the glowering sky, lava coiled down to stream hissing into the ocean.

And above the volcano, literally leaning over it, a foam-flecked wall of green. Tidal wave? No. The Earth term didn’t apply. This was bigger. More spectacular. Looming larger than the mountain itself, caught just seconds before impact.

“We couldn’t land on Storm,” Becker said. “There was no safe place to put down. But we sent manned probes into the atmosphere. This slide was taken by one of those probes.” He smiled again and put a note of pride into his voice. But in with the pride, just barely, was a taste of anger. “I’m happy to tell you that it was my probe.”

At least they can’t take that away from me, he thought. They took away my stars, but they can’t take Storm. I captured it with this picture. The essence of a planet. The soul. There, in a holocube. And it’s mine.

And I was the only one to see the rest. Seconds after. When the wildwave hit, and the volcano broke and shattered under the blow, and the world was full of storm and steam and fire. And I was the only one to watch. . . .

His voice was going on smoothly without him. “Storm is a young world,” it was saying. “Still very much a toddler on the celestial scale. But it’s a lusty kid. It’s mostly water, and what land there is is still volcanic. Earthquakes and eruptions are daily events—and they give birth to things like the wildwave you see in the cube. Winds average hundreds of miles an hour, and the electrical displays make common Earth lightning look pale and weak. Look.”

The trident and the wildwave vanished, and a skyscape took their place. There was ball lightning everywhere, and massive bolts that crackled and joined in a blinding net.

You can almost hear the thunder just looking at it. But on Storm, I didn’t just hear. I felt it. It was all around me, and the ship shook to it, and I was scared shitless. But at least I was alive. What am I now?

His thumb moved of its own volition, and a new view of Storm came oncube. And his voice continued its glib narration. But the rest of him was millions of miles away, lost in a land of lightning and wildwaves.

Storm was my favorite, his thought ran. Red Light was a heart-stopping first, and Anthill was haunting and puzzling and magical. But them I shared. Storm was almost my own. Only a handful of us got to swoop down, after Ainslie got careless and let his probe get blown against a mountain. But I was one of the handful. They can’t take that away, either.

His mind wandered. But all the while new vistas came and went in the cube, and his voice went on, and the ladies ooohed and aahed on schedule. And, finally, the end approached. And jerked him back to reality.

The next-to-last slide was the same as the first; the Starwind, in orbit around Earth. Waiting for new supplies, and funding, and a new mission. And a few new men.

The last slide was an address. Glowing red letters floated in the white cube. And Becker, hating it, provided the narration.

“Space exploration is the greatest adventure in man’s history,” he said, smiling his plastic smile and talking with a plastic-pleasant tongue. “And the stars are our joy and our destiny. Not everyone can go to the stars, of course. But all those who want to can share in the adventure, and help to build the destiny. Worldgov has many expenses, and many causes crying for priority. It can only fund a small part of the budget needed to operate the starcruisers. The rest, as you know, is provided by interested citizens.

“If you share our dreams, we ask you to join the fight. For only a hundred credits a year, you can become members of the Friends of SPACE. You’ll receive membership credentials, of course. And a complimentary subscription to Starflight, the official SPACE magazine. And you’ll be giving a gift to your children. All your children, and all the children of man. You’ll be giving them the stars.”

“For a gift like that, the price tag is pretty low.” He pointed at the address floating in the holocube. “If you’d like to help, send your contributions there—to SPACE, Box 27, Worldgov Center, Geneva.”

His smile broadened. “And, of course, all contributions are tax deductible.” He bowed silently, and flicked off the holocaster. “Whether you care to contribute or not, I hope you enjoyed the show.”

Then the audience started applauding, and the lights came on, and the chairwoman rose to announce that refreshments would be served. While they were getting the food, a steady stream of women flowed up to Becker and thanked him effusively for his presentation and promised him support. He acknowledged their praise with nods and laughter and pleasant smiles.

And despised them, all the while. God, he thought, I hate this. They’ve taken away my stars and given me chattering fat ladies and phony upperlevel parlors. And I hate it. And it isn’t fair. Hell, it isn’t even life.

They gave him synthetic coffee and protein cookies. And he took them with a smile. And hated them. But he ate them, and stayed, and made small talk. That was SPACE policy. Finally, the audience began to break up and leave, one by one.

Just as Becker was beginning to think of leaving, the doctor drifted up, holding his coffee limply. He didn’t seem quite as old with the lights on. But he looked very tired.

“That was quite a show, Commander,” he said with a wan smile. “I’m afraid you blitzed me. I have a hunch you’ll be getting all the contributions.”

Becker returned a professional smile. “Well, your presentation was very interesting, Doctor. And there’s certainly a need for your kind of work down in the undercities. I wouldn’t be so pessimistic.”

The doctor frowned slightly, sipped his coffee, and shook his head. “Come, Commander. Don’t humor me. I’m new at this game and I did very badly. And you’re good enough to know that.”

Becker, who was busy packing up his holocaster, gave the doctor a sharp glance and a genuine grin. He looked around to make sure none of the women were in range of the conversation, then nodded quickly. “You’re sharp. And right—your show was third-rate. But you’ll get better with time. And then the contributions will start to come in.”

“Hmmmmm. Yes.” The doctor looked at him hard, paused. Then he seemed to make up his mind about something. And he continued. “Meanwhile, of course, thousands of kids down in the undercities are hungry and sick. And they stay that way. And maybe die. Why? Because I’m not as slick as you.” His mouth set in a hard line. “Tell me honestly, Commander—don’t you ever feel guilty?”

The case on the holocaster snapped up with a sharp click, and Becker’s grin died. “No,” he said. There was a bite in his tone suddenly. “Doctor, you know that there are four starcruisers. There could be forty. Or four hundred. There should be. But Worldgov won’t give us the money. Comments like you just made are costing us the stars.”

Are costing me the stars, he was saying to himself, his mind seething. So few ships, so many volunteers. And that damned waiting list . . .

What was it that General Henderson had said? Thousands, wasn’t it? Yes. “Commander, there are thousands of applicants for every starcruiser berth. And your performance on your first voyage was . . . well, adequate. But not outstanding. I’m afraid I’m going to have to turn down your application for permanent crew status. I’m sorry.”

And I said . . . what? I said, “You’re taking away my .stars.” For the first time, if not the last.

“I’m sorry,” he said. That bastard. He never flew on a starcruiser in his life. That fatass would never leave Earth. “There’s nothing I can do. However, Commander, there’s still place for you. You’re good-looking and articulate, and you believe in what we’re doing. SPACE needs men like you. We’re moving you to public relations. Without which, I might add, the starcruisers would be impossible.”

“I’m as compassionate as anyone,” Becker said, slinging the holocaster under an arm. “I think your work is vital. I feel for those kids. But you should try some empathy too. And try to understand what we’re doing.”

“What you’re doing is a luxury when kids are hungry on Earth,” the doctor said.

Becker shook his head. “No. There has to be room for both. Say you save a kid from death, Doctor. Fine. But what kind of life are you giving him? A pretty drab one, without the stars. And a hopeless one, in the long run. Maybe man can survive on Earth, alone. I think he could. But his dream can’t, and his myths can’t. There are too many people, and they’ve crowded out all the dreams. And there’s no life left for anyone. Just day-to-day survival.”

He paused there. It was a good speech, his own restatement of arguments he had heard hundreds of times in SPACE headquarters. It was enough. But he wanted to add more. He was angry and resentful, and he went on.

“I’ll tell you something else, Doctor. I think we need both your work and mine, both Earth and the stars. But I think the balance is wrong. I think we need more stars.”

He slapped the holocaster with his free hand. “You think I like this sort of shit? I hate it, Doctor. Just like you’d hate it if you did it all the time. I’ve dreamed of the stars all my life and now they tell me I’m not good enough to get a permanent berth on a starcruiser. Not that I’m bad, mind you. I’m just not outstanding enough. And there’s so little room.

“Tell me, Doctor, how would you feel if Worldgov suddenly announced that only the best four hundred doctors in the world would be allowed to practice medicine? Would you make the grade? What would you do? Can you imagine what it’d be like? Going through life, day to day, knowing what you wanted to do—and knowing that it was denied to you, maybe forever. Try to imagine that, if you can. Try to taste it. That’s what it’s like for me, you see.

“You can’t live on Earth, Doctor. I can’t, anyway. I can exist, but I don’t call it living. I’ve seen the wildwaves of Storm and listened to the Spiderants sing their dawn. Am I supposed to content myself with mindspin trips and football games?” He snorted.

The doctor had calmly continued to sip his coffee during Becker’s outburst. Now he lowered his cup, sighed, and gave another tired shake of his head.

“Commander, I feel sorry for you,” he said. “You sound very bitter. Like you’ve been cheated. But you’ve been so credibly lucky. And you don’t realize it. You’ve done things most people only dream of, yet you complain of an empty life. I don’t buy that. You’ve flown on a starcruiser, even if it was only once. Commander, let me tell you something. Down In the undercity I’ve got patients who’ve never even seen the stars. And you’ve been there.”

Becker, his anger subsided, gave a wistful smile that seemed somehow out of character. But very genuine.

“I’ve thought of that,” he said sadly. “Sometimes. Maybe you’re right. But it doesn’t help, Doctor. I wish it did. But it doesn’t.” He thought a minute. “I’m sorry for your patients who’ve never seen the stars,” he said when he resumed. “You know, I think that’s almost worse than hunger. Although that’s not fair for me to say, since I’ve never really been hungry. I hope someday you take your kids to the upperlevels, so they get a glimpse through the smog.”

Becker shrugged then. “They’re not the only ones I’m sorry for, though. I’m sorry for everyone who has seen the stars and can’t go there. And most of all I’m sorry for me, who’s been there. And can’t go back. I guess that makes me selfish. But that’s the way it is, I’m afraid. And I try to live with it.

“And I do sort of believe in what I do. Maybe someday Worldgov will change its mind and we’ll get more starcruisers. And I can go out again. And take some of your kids with me, who knows? It’s for them too, you know.”

Becker wanted to end it there. But the doctor, still unconvinced, came back again. “That’s big of you,” he said. “But before you give them the stars, try giving them some food, or a healthy environment.”

Becker glanced around the room. It was very late, and most of the audience had gone home. Time to break it off, he thought. Another damned show tomorrow.

“I could answer that,” he said. “But I won’t. I’m not going to convince you, Doctor. And you’re not going to convince me, either, I’m afraid. So let’s call it a night. Peace?”

He smiled and offered his hand. The doctor shook it. Then Becker turned to the chairwoman and the few matrons who remained, and bade them good night. And left.

It was cold outside on the upperlevels, and there was a brisk night wind whistling down the street between the tower-tops. Becker stopped briefly on his way to the interlevel tubes and looked up. But the smog was heavy, and he could not see stars.

And maybe that was just as well.



Chicago

July, 1972
