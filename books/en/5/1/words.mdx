1.

Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar

there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel at

it seemed unfair that anyone should possess perpetual youth as well as inexhaustible wealth

most people were willing to forgive him his oddities

the hopes were finally dashed

their reminiscences in welcome demand

He held forth at The Ivy Bush

him being partial to his vittles

there was this Mr. Frodo left an orphan and stranded

A regular warren, by all accounts

packed with chests of gold and silver, and jools

I’d not long come prentice to old Holman

trampling and trapessing all over the garden

old wandering conjuror

retorted the Gaffer

for nigh on a century

toiled up the Hill

not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the disappointment of the onlookers

snapdragons and sunflowers, and nasturtians trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows.

more carts rolled up the Hill

no admittance except on party business

covered with ropes and poles for tents and pavilions

flags were unfurled and the fun began

A very few were overlooked by accident

not so lavishly as on this occasion

like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices

a phalanx of flying swans

he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd

They all ducked, and many fell flat on their faces.

The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater with a deafening explosion.

the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet

He was liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry

allude to the absurd adventures of his mysterious journey

as Bilbo’s catering had depleted the stocks of most of the stores

nibbling at their favourite dainties

a pretty dance, but rather vigorous

pricked up their ears

Some perfunctory clapping by the elders

Obstinate silence

One hundred and forty-four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless

He had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the indignant surprise of the guests

listening with a smile to the din in the pavilion

a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard

a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell

You are always badgering me about my ring

he seemed to grow tall and menacing

the air of the room tingled

He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man

smiled rather ruefully

removed in wheelbarrows those that had inadvertently remained behind

written reams of good advice

a round convex mirror

Bilbo’s residence had got rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life.

It was a tendency of hobbit-holes to get cluttered up

a new spade

a bottle of ointment for creaking joints

He escorted her firmly off the premises

she was in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark

evicted three young hobbits

Frodo also had a tussle with young Sancho

had begun an excavation in the larger pantry

he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea

with a face that would have curdled new milk

He said you had pestered him till he told you

They say I am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace

How abominable!

2.

he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers

there were various other rustic hobbits

“No doubt you can,” retorted Sam

this one was as big as an elm tree

walking seven yards to a stride, if it was an inch

Sam waved his arm vaguely

Gandalf looked older and more careworn

with the same vigour and delight

some more potent and some less

The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown

they were perilous

no words of Saruman could allay

It would be a grievous blow to the world

There is such a thing as malice and revenge

Frodo gave a cry and groped for the tongs

the clack of Sam’s shears

he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs

which I will not utter here

Always after a defeat and a respite

his hand never touched them or sullied them

and so ensnared them

not all Men were estranged from them

for there was sorrow then too, and gathering dark, but great valor, and great deeds that were not wholly vain

Then Sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled

made little boats of reeds

The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family

he burrowed under trees and growing plants

there were great beds of iris and flowering reeds

The ring had given him power according to his stature

was shunned by all his relations

as through a chink in the dark

only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering

he would never have just forsaken it

Sméagol’s grandmother was a matriarch

wrung the true story out of him

together with much snivelling and snarling

catch small frightened or unwary things

He was not daunted by the distance

when we pressed him he whined and cringed

On some errand of mischief

he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himself

a heavy sledge-hammer

This Ring has already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated

Not even the anvils and furnaces of the Dwarves could do that

the fabled Cracks of Doom

with a dart he sprang to the sill

There was a squawk

How long have you been eavesdropping?

“Well, sir,” said Sam dithering a little.

3.

he wanted to savor as much as he could of his last summer

He had not done any strenuous walking for a long time

piled them in the porch

away down yonder

his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders

said Sam stoutly and untruthfully

They went in single file along hedgerows and the borders of coppices

The night was clear, cool, and starry

Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads

After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees

Pippin began to lag behind

The morning came, pale and clammy

looking rather bleary

their packs all trussed up again

a brown woodland haze

is it one of your imitations?

every path was its tributary

until he dwindled into the distance

this hindered them

the grass was thick and tussocky

the trees began to draw together into thickets

they came on the huge hulk of a tree

the broken stumps of its long-fallen limbs

They went abreast and in step, to keep up their spirits

They began to hum softly

Apple, thorn, and nut and sloe,

crouched behind a large tree-bole

there came a sound like mingled song and laughter

you shall lodge with us tonight

deep brakes of hazel

through the thickets on the right

your pursuers will assail you

does not bode well

fell at once into a dreamless slumber

4.

his bed was of fern and grass, deep and soft and strangely fragrant

He was running on the green turf and singing

if we are going to toil through bog and briar, let’s go now!

steep slippery sides overhung with brambles

the air was still and stuffy

To heal my heart and drown my woe.

there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage

They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout gate

Beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump of trees.

this young varmint sets foot on my land

the worst young rascals of Buckland

the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting

crossing a deep dike

the slow clop of the ponies’ hoofs

5.

A large flat ferry-boat was moored beside it

The white bollards near the water’s edge
