title: Chapter 9 Six Questions
---

Having released myself early from the burden of offering “solutions” to the problem of the disappearance of childhood, I wish to conclude this book by putting forward several questions that readers may find of interest. Each of these questions occurred to me at some point in the course of my inquiry, and then attached itself, barnacle-like, to my mind. This is my way of getting free of them (at least for the moment), which is to say, I have tried to supply them with answers. To the extent that readers will have different answers, I shall be flattered to think the questions are important.





Was childhood discovered or invented?


This book begins with the statement that childhood is a social artifact, not a biological necessity. Readers who are well-versed in child psychology will regard this statement as, at best, problematic and, at worst, false. Backed by the authority of such researchers as Freud, Erik Erikson, Arnold Gesell, and, in particular, Jean Piaget, prevailing opinion holds that observable stages of child development are governed by biological imperatives. Indeed, Piaget calls his studies “genetic epistemology,” by which he means that the child’s advance from one level of intellectual achievement to the next follows a genetic principle. I have not gone into this matter because it is in most respects irrelevant to the issues discussed in this book. The fact is that the idea of childhood as a social structure did not exist in the Middle Ages, it arose in the sixteenth century, and is now disappearing. But, of course, if Piaget is right, then childhood was not invented by literacy but only discovered, and the new information environment is not “disappearing” it but only suppressing it.

I believe that Piaget’s studies are limited by his essentially ahistorical approach. He gave insufficient attention to the possibility that the behaviors he observed in children might have been absent or at least quite different at earlier historical periods. Nonetheless, I rather hope that he is correct. If he is, we may encourage ourselves to believe that, given the slightest chance, childhood will assert itself, for, as it is said, you cannot fool Mother Nature, at least not forever. If, however, childhood is solely a creation of culture, as I am inclined to believe, then it would have to await a dramatic restructuring of our communication environment in order to reappear along strong and unmistakable lines. And this may never happen. We are thus faced with the possibility that childhood is a transitory aberration in cultural history, like the horse-drawn carriage or black scribbles on white paper.

To cheer myself up, I am willing to settle for the following formulation and hope that future research will confirm it: Childhood is analogous to language learning. It has a biological basis but cannot be realized unless a social environment triggers and nurtures it, that is, has need of it. If a culture is dominated by a medium that requires the segregation of the young in order that they learn unnatural, specialized, and complex skills and attitudes, then childhood, in one form or another, will emerge, articulate and indispensable. If the communication needs of a culture do not require the long-term segregation of the young, then childhood remains mute.





Does the decline of childhood signify a general decline of American culture?


America is the first and, at present, the only culture living entirely under the control of twentieth-century technology. With very few exceptions, Americans have been willing to accommodate their landscape, their cities, their business enterprises, their family life, and their minds to the requirements of what they choose to call “technological progress.” Thus, we may rightly say that America is now in the midst of its Third Great Experiment, and the full results are by no means known.

The First Great Experiment, which Thomas Paine called “a revolution in the principles and practice of governments,” began in the late eighteenth century, and posed the question, Is freedom of thought and expression a viable idea on which to base a political structure?” The Second Great Experiment, begun in the mid-nineteenth century, was of a social nature, and posed the question, Can a culture be forged out of a population made up of groups of people from all over the world, each with its own language, traditions, and habits? Granting certain failures along the way, we may say that both of these experiments have been successful and to a considerable extent have been the wonder and envy of the world.

The Third Great Experiment, begun at the start of this century, poses the question, Can a culture preserve humane values and create new ones by allowing modern technology the fullest possible authority to control its destiny? Aldous Huxley and George Orwell have already given their answer, and it is “No.” Lewis Mumford has given his, and it is “Probably no,” the same answer given by Norbert Wiener. Jacques Ellul gives his answer in almost yearly reports, and it is the most resounding “No” of all. Among those whose answer is some variety of “Yes” are Buckminster Fuller, Alvin Toffler, Melvin Kranzberg, Samuel Florman, and Isaac Asimov, the latter being positively giddy about both the accomplishments and the potential of technology. Obviously, the question is still open, and we are permitted to guess. That technology itself has been deified, that the political process has been degraded, that the adult mind has been diminished, and that childhood is waning are woeful signs. The world watches to see if America can survive the dismembering of its past, and then will make plans accordingly.

But America has not yet begun to think. The shock of twentieth-century technology numbed our brains and we are just beginning to notice the spiritual and social debris that our technology has strewn about us. But not everyone was dumbstruck. We may, for example, recall that Ralph Nader’s Unsafe at Any Speed, published in 1965, was a powerful and popular critique of a major technology. It is true that it came after Americans had allowed the automobile to change their landscape, their cities, and their social life. But it came nonetheless. And it has been followed (and indeed was quietly preceded) by other critiques and maps of the path we have taken: McLuhan on Understanding Media, Ellul on The Technological Society, Wiener on The Human Use of Human Beings, Joseph Weisenbaum on Computer Power and Human Reason, Mumford on The Myth of the Machine, Kenneth Boulding on The Meaning of the Twentieth Century, Boorstin on The Image, to name a few. To the extent that such books, and others to come, will help to give Americans both pause and perspective, and suggest to them ways in which technology might serve their purposes (instead of the other way around), there is reason to hope that the early signs of cultural disintegration are not permanent.

As for childhood, I believe it must, in the long run, be a victim of what is happening. Electricity makes nonsense of the kind of information environment that gives rise to and nurtures childhood. But in losing childhood, we do not have to lose everything. After all, the printing press shattered the cohesion of a world religious community, destroyed the intimacy and poetry of the oral tradition, diminished regional loyalties, and created a cruelly impersonal industrial system. And yet, Western civilization survived with some of its humane values intact and was able to forge new ones, including those associated with the nurturing of children. Now that the first shock of what we have embarked upon is beginning to diminish, we may yet think ourselves into a more felicitous position and come out resembling something worth saving.





To what extent do the Moral Majority and other Fundamentalist groups contribute toward the preservation of childhood?


In the 1950s, as some elders will recall, if you ventured to observe that the Communist party had put forward a good idea on any subject, you had to prepare yourself for the accusation that you were, at best, a “fellow traveler,” and, at worst, a card-carrying member of the party. In certain circles today the same sort of thinking prevails in respect to the Fundamentalist movement: to speak a word that coincides with any Fundamentalist position will earn you the accusation of having abandoned the liberal tradition. By way of preparation against that charge, I should say that the Fundamentalist revival is, in my opinion, potentially dangerous because it is infused with the spirit of religious bigotry and political authoritarianism. Moreover, I have the impression that many Fundamentalist Christians love their nation-state far more than they love their God, and that nothing makes them happier than that which would make their Lord despair: the addition of devastating new weapons to the nation-state’s arsenal.

And yet, as previously noted, the Moral Majority, as they are sometimes called, appears to me more aware of what the new information environment has done to children than any other group in the body politic. Its attempts to organize economic boycotts against sponsors of certain television programs, its attempts to restore a sense of inhibition and reverence to sexuality, its attempts at setting up schools that insist on rigorous standards of civilité, are examples of an active program aimed at preserving childhood. Of course, none of this can be effective in achieving that aim, since it is too little, comes too late, and does not, in fact, even address the problem of a completely restructured information environment. But I believe the effort is commendable nonetheless, and—who knows?—perhaps it may serve to slow down the dissolution of childhood so that we will have sufficient time to adjust to its absence.

The liberal tradition (or, as the Moral Majority contemptuously calls it, secular humanism) has had pitifully little to offer in this matter. For example, in opposing economic boycotts of TV sponsors, civil libertarians have taken the curious position that it is better to have Procter & Gamble’s moral standards control television’s content than Queen Victoria’s. In any case, to the extent that a political philosophy can influence cultural change, the liberal tradition has tended to encourage the decline of childhood by its generous acceptance of all that is modern, and a corresponding hostility to anything that tries to “turn back the clock.” But in some respects the clock is wrong, and the Moral Majority may serve as a reminder of a world that was once hospitable to children and felt deeply responsible for what they might become. It is permissible, I think, for those of us who disapprove of the arrogance of the Moral Majority to borrow some of their memories.





Are there any communication technologies that have the potential to sustain the need for childhood?


The only technology that has this capacity is the computer. In order to program a computer, one must, in essence, learn a language. This means that one must have control over complex analytical skills similar to those required of a fully literate person, and for which special training is required. Should it be deemed necessary that everyone must know how computers work, how they impose their special world-view, how they alter our definition of judgment—that is, should it be deemed necessary that there be universal computer literacy—it is conceivable that the schooling of the young will increase in importance and a youth culture different from adult culture might be sustained. But such a development would depend on many different factors. The potential effects of a medium can be rendered impotent by the uses to which the medium is put. For example, radio, by its nature, has the potential to amplify and celebrate the power and poetry of human speech, and there are parts of the world in which radio is used to do this. In America, partly as a result of competition with television, radio has become merely an adjunct of the music industry. And, as a consequence, sustained, articulate, and mature speech is almost entirely absent from the airwaves (with the magnificent exception of National Public Radio). Thus, it is not inevitable that the computer will be used to promote sequential, logical, and complex thought among the mass of people. There are, for example, economic and political interests that would be better served by allowing the bulk of a semiliterate population to entertain itself with the magic of visual computer games, to use and be used by computers without understanding. In this way the computer would remain mysterious and under the control of a bureaucratic elite. There would be no need to educate the young, and childhood could, without obstruction, continue on its journey to oblivion.





Are there any social institutions strong enough and committed enough to resist the decline of childhood?


There are only two institutions that have an interest in the matter. The first is the family; the other, the school. As already noted, the structure and authority of the family have been severely weakened as parents have lost control over the information environment of the young. Margaret Mead once referred to television, for example, as the Second Parent, by which she meant that our children literally spend more time with television than with their fathers. In such terms, fathers may be the Fourth or Fifth Parent, trailing behind television, records, radio, and movies. Indeed, encouraged by the trend toward the devaluation of parenthood, Bell Telephone has had the effrontery to urge fathers to use “Dial-a-Story” as a substitute for telling their own stories to children. In any case, it is quite clear that the media have diminished the role of the family in shaping the values and sensibilities of the young.

Moreover, and possibly as a result of the enlarged sovereignty of the media, many parents have lost confidence in their ability to raise children because they believe that the information and instincts they have about child-rearing are unreliable. As a consequence, they not only do not resist media influence, they turn to experts who are presumed to know what is best for children. Thus, psychologists, social workers, guidance counselors, teachers, and others representing an institutional point of view invade large areas of parental authority, mostly by invitation. What this means is that there is a loss in the intimacy, dependence, and loyalty that traditionally characterize the parent-child relationship. Indeed, it is now believed by some that the parent-child relationship is essentially neurotic, and that children are better served by institutions than by their families.

Even more devastating to the power of the family is the women’s liberation movement. So that I am not misunderstood on this point, I must say at once that the liberation of women from limited social roles is one of the truly humane effects of the technological revolution and deserves the full support of enlightened people. But it cannot be denied that as women find their place in business, in the arts, in industry, and in the professions, there must be a serious decline in the strength and meaning of traditional patterns of child care. For whatever criticisms may be made of the exclusive role of women as nurturers, the fact is that it is women, and women alone, who have been the overseers of childhood, shaping it and protecting it. It is unlikely that men will assume anything like the role women have played, and still do, in raising children, no matter how sensible it might be for men to do so. Thus, as parents of both sexes make their way in the world, children become something of a burden, and, increasingly, it is deemed best that their childhood end as early as possible. All of this adds up to the fact that unless there occurs a 180° turn in social trends, the American family will not stand in strong opposition to the contraction and then dissolution of childhood.

As for school, it is the only public institution left to us based on the assumption that there are important differences between childhood and adulthood and that adults have things of value to teach children. For this reason, childlike optimists still write books advising educators on how they ought to conduct themselves, and, in particular, on how they might pursue conserving activities. But the declining authority of the schools has been well documented, and amid a radically changed communication structure they have become (to quote Marshall McLuhan) houses of detention rather than attention. Educators, of course, are confused about what they are expected to do with children. For example, as the teaching of literacy becomes more difficult to do, educators are even losing their enthusiasm for that time-honored task and wonder if it ought not be abandoned altogether. For another example, equally depressing: In some schools, children as young as eleven and twelve have inflicted upon them what is called “career training,” a clear symptom of the reemergence of the miniature adult. It is evident that schools reflect social trends far more powerfully than they can direct them, and are close to impotent in opposing them.

Nonetheless, as a creation of literacy, the school will not easily join in the assault on its parentage. In one form or another, no matter how diluted the effort, the school will stand as the last defense against the disappearance of childhood.

It goes without saying that in due course, when all teachers and administrators are themselves products of the Television Age, resistance will not only lose whatever strength it may have had but its point will have been forgotten.





Is the individual powerless to resist what is happening?


The answer to this, in my opinion, is “No.” But, as with all resistance, there is a price to pay. Specifically, resistance entails conceiving of parenting as an act of rebellion against American culture. For example, for parents merely to remain married is itself an act of disobedience and an insult to the spirit of a throwaway culture in which continuity has little value. It is also at least ninety percent un-American to remain in close proximity to one’s extended family so that children can experience, daily, the meaning of kinship and the value of deference and responsibility to elders. Similarly, to insist that one’s children learn the discipline of delayed gratification, or modesty in their sexuality, or self-restraint in manners, language, and style is to place oneself in opposition to almost every social trend. Even further, to ensure that one’s children work hard at becoming literate is extraordinarily time-consuming and even expensive. But most rebellious of all is the attempt to control the media’s access to one’s children. There are, in fact, two ways to do this. The first is to limit the amount of exposure children have to media. The second is to monitor carefully what they are exposed to, and to provide them with a continuously running critique of the themes and values of the media’s content. Both are very difficult to do and require a level of attention that most parents are not prepared to give to child-rearing.

Nonetheless, there are parents who are committed to doing all of these things, who are in effect defying the directives of their culture. Such parents are not only helping their children to have a childhood but are, at the same time, creating a sort of intellectual elite. Certainly in the short run the children who grow up in such homes will, as adults, be much favored by business, the professions, and the media themselves. What can we say of the long run? Only this: Those parents who resist the spirit of the age will contribute to what might be called the Monastery Effect, for they will help to keep alive a humane tradition. It is not conceivable that our culture will forget that it needs children. But it is halfway toward forgetting that children need childhood. Those who insist on remembering shall perform a noble service.
