title: BLOOD ON THE KEYS
---




A doctor had two sons and a daughter. He decided that the older son, Henry, was to be a doctor. The mother decided that this son would be a concert pianist. For four hours each day she made him practice the piano. The father didn’t see anything wrong with this. Henry soon learned that he had to outwit his mother in some way. So he bit his fingernails down to the quick, and as he played the piano he left traces of blood all over the keys. His mother was hardhearted, and she made him play in spite of that. He bit his nails more, but no amount of blood interfered with his practice. He kept on biting his nails. He was not allowed to go to school unless he played the piano four hours a day. And he wanted to go to school. Later, he wanted to go to high school. So he had to practice the piano four hours a day. Later, when he wanted to go to college, he had to practice four hours a day to get his allowance.

After college, Henry’s father wanted him to go to medical school and Henry didn’t want to do this. He managed to flunk out of medical school. His father was a good politician and got him admitted to another medical school. He flunked out of that school. By this time Henry had his own ideas. He wanted to study political science, so he deliberately cheated, openly, brazenly cheated, and he was blacklisted from all medical schools. His father brought him to me and told me, “Hypnotize him and make him stop biting his nails.”

Henry was twenty-six, Henry said, “I want to study political science but my father left me without any funds.”

Henry got a job with a mortician. He hated it. He drove an ambulance there. And I told the father, “I’ll take care of your son. I have my own ways of doing therapy.”

The father said, “I don’t care about your ways of doing therapy as long as you make Henry grow his nails. There is no way I can get my son into medical school with those horrible fingers.”

I said to Henry, “What do you think about your habit?”

Henry said, “It’s an ingrown pattern of mine. I can’t help biting my nails. I must do it in my sleep. I have no desire to have nails like this. They’re hideous! I would not like to have a pretty girl look at my hands.”

I said, “Well, Henry, you have ten fingers. Now, I’m absolutely positive that nine fingers can furnish you with all the nail diet you need and you can grow a long nail on any given finger while you feed on the other nine.”

Henry said, “That’s right.”

I said, “In fact, you could have two fingers to grow long nails and the other eight could furnish you all the nail diet you want.”

Henry said, “I see exactly what you are getting at. It will end up with your telling me one finger is all I need to feed on and I can grow nine finger nails. And, dammit, I’m caught with your logic!” It didn’t take him long to grow ten fingernails.

Then I said, “Henry, your father is not supporting you. You are working, and you play the piano four hours a day.”

He said, “I like music but I hate the piano. I really like music.”

I said, “A piano isn’t the only instrument. You’ve had twenty-two years of experience of playing on instruments’ keys.”

Henry said, “I’ll get me an electric organ.”

And he played the electric organ so perfectly that he was very much in demand for weddings and parties. And he played the electric organ all the way through law school. His father was furious at me!

The second son, the father had decided, was to become an Episcopalian priest. That son had married a Jewish woman. And he’d gotten a job in a second-hand-car lot. He was a drunkard, selling second-hand cars, and married to a Jewish woman!

And the daughter had her instructions. She was to grow up and become a charge nurse. And the daughter ran away at sixteen. She went to one of the Carolinas and married her teenage sweetheart.

Henry’s brother decided that if Henry could study political science and law, he and his Jewish wife did not have to keep on hating each other. They were both unhappy with the marriage. He didn’t have to keep on drinking. He divorced her. Episcopalian ministers are not supposed to be divorced. He said, “You can’t make an Episcopalian minister out of me—and I’m going to be a car dealer. I’m going to deal in new cars!” And he succeeded in that!

And Henry, the lawyer, and his brother, the car dealer, laid down the law for the sister and her sixteen-year-old husband. They visited both sets of parents and laid down the law. Her husband was to go to college and get good marks. He could study anything he pleased. And the sister was to go to college and get a bachelor’s degree and she and her husband could make their own joint decisions.




In this tale, the coercive nature of the parents is highlighted. The father had a fixed idea that his son must be a doctor. The mother had a fixed idea that her son must become a pianist. Typically, the father ordered Erickson to “hypnotize him and make him stop biting his nails.” Even after Henry had been blacklisted from all medical schools, the father blindly insisted that it was only his bitten nails that prevented Henry from being accepted in another medical school. For many years Henry had reacted to his parents’ coercion with symptoms such as nail biting. Of course, he did not feel that he was responsible for his symptoms. He said, “I can’t help biting my nails.” Let’s look at how Erickson dealt with him—and with his entire family.

Erickson intervened at first by taking responsibility on himself, presenting himself as “a good father.” He said, “I will take care of your son.” He then showed himself to be a more rational guide with whom the son could identify, without delaying his own legitimate wishes and strivings. By the use of a double bind (telling him to bite, but not bite), he got Henry to admit very early in therapy, “I am caught in your logic.” Henry could see that if he followed Erickson’s suggestion, he could satisfy any nail-biting needs while allowing most of his nails to grow. In other words, he was encouraged to express any legitimate impulses, but to direct them—in this case, to one fingernail. Next, Erickson applied this principle to the question of playing the piano. He determined that Henry did enjoy music and encouraged him to express and satisfy this area of interest and enjoyment. However, Henry selected his own instrument. Once he had discovered that he could do what he wanted to do, he was able to go further in determining his own path in life and work himself through law school by utilizing the talent and interest he had already developed.

After Henry had broken away from the imprisoning influence of his parents and had found more effective methods of rebelling than nail biting, he was able to help his brother to assert himself. The two brothers then joined forces to “lay down the law” to their parents and, in fact, to the entire family, including their sister’s young husband and his parents. They were able to do this because they had the strength of numbers and unity and because they now represented rational values and “healthy” goals. Interestingly, they did not insist that the sister leave her sixteen-year-old husband. The husband, instead, was included in the self-betterment program that had always been a family priority and that was, incidentally, important to Erickson.

The mother and father obviously believed in education and self-improvement. Unfortunately, they had been too rigid and insensitive in their attempts to impose their values on their children. Finally, though, all the children were able to satisfy their parents’ healthy concern for them. Henry became a professional, a lawyer, and an organist, thus satisfying both his father’s and his mother’s hopes. Henry’s brother dissolved the mixed marriage that undoubtedly distressed his parents and succeeded as a new-car dealer. The sister acquired a college education.

Erickson illustrates the “ripple effect,” as described by Spiegel. This effect is seen in each individual and through the family. Alleviation of Henry’s nail biting led to greater self-confidence, which led to Henry’s assertive behavior. He “selected his own instrument.” The freeing of one member of the family from irrational coercion led to the freeing of the next, which led to the freeing of the next. Even the overly anxious parents were undoubtedly freed from their undue concern about their children. In any therapy, we know that although we are focusing on one patient, any changes in that patient will affect and change everyone in his “world” or “system.”
