title: THE TARAHUMARA INDIANS
---




The Tarahumara Indians of southwestern Chihuahua are the ones who can run a hundred miles—their pressure doesn’t go up and their heartbeat doesn’t change. Some entrepreneur took some hundred-mile runners to the Olympics (1928, Amsterdam). They didn’t even place. Because, they thought twenty-five miles was when you warmed up! It hadn’t been explained to them that their run was twenty-five miles long.




I sometimes think about that story when I am having difficulty getting into a task, when I am writing, repairing something around the house, frustrated by difficulties, or literally breathless from jogging. The phrase will come into my head—“I am just warming up now.” I usually find more energy available after this.
