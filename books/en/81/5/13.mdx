title: A GORGEOUS WAY TO DIET
---




Now, another girl was overweight, and markedly so. I pointed out to her, “You’re overweight and you’ve dieted and dieted, to no avail. And you tell me that you can stay on a diet for a week, or two weeks, even three weeks, and then you fall off and gorge. Then you’re despairing and gorge some more.

“Now, I’ll give you a medical prescription. Continue the diet given to you by your doctor in the past. Stay on that diet for two weeks and three weeks, if you can. And then, on the last Sunday of that third week, gorge like hell, because it’s medical orders. You can’t gorge enough to offset your losses in the three weeks. And you can gorge without a sense of guilt because you’re under medical orders to gorge all day Sunday. And the following Monday go back to your diet. Stay on it three weeks, if you can, and then have another guiltless gorge day.”

In my last letter from her she says that there has to be a better way to diet than saving up her hunger three weeks. She wants to be hungry each day, wants to enjoy food and enjoy the proper amount, each day. The gorging days gave her the strength to be on the diet for those three weeks.




This approach falls into the category of “prescribing the symptom.” Erickson told the patient to do exactly what she had been doing—dieting for three weeks, “when she was able,” and then gorging. All that changed was the length of time devoted to the gorging. If a pattern can be changed, even in some small way, there is the possibility for further change. As we have seen many times, this is one of Erickson’s basic approaches in therapy—to initiate a small change.
