title: STONES AND QUANTUM MECHANICS
---




All of you have seen my stones that were polished two hundred million years ago. My fifteen-year-old grandson said, “These stones were polished two hundred million years ago. That eliminates man. I ought to know how they were polished. You wouldn’t show me a water-polished stone. I’ve lived in Okinawa; I’ve seen water-polished stones. And I’ve been around volcanos; it wouldn’t be that. You’re showing me something unexpected, from two hundred million years ago. I know you’re showing me something that I know about. I’ve got to stop thinking about sand and water and ice, and man.”

While he was cogitating about that I said, “I have another riddle to ask you. What does this refer to? ‘How I want a drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy chapters involving quantum mechanics.’”

He said, “I don’t get it. I don’t know what quantum mechanics are.”

I said, “You don’t need to know. I’ll give you the illiterate answer. Drive two fenceposts into the ground two feet apart. Lay across the fenceposts a board just long enough to overlap the posts by an inch, and you get the illiterate answer.”




It took Erickson’s grandson a few minutes before he was able to exclaim, “That’s the first time I’ve ever thought of it that way!” It may take most readers even longer to visualize the “illiterate” answer or to draw two vertical lines with a horizontal line above them——the symbol for “pi.” Erickson gives another hint, one that would probably be helpful only for medical students and doctors of medicine. He says, “All doctors know the mnemonic for the cranial nerves, ‘On old Olympus’ towering tops a Finn and German vend some hops.’” Thus, instead of simply saying, “The riddle is a mnemonic,” Erickson gives an example of another mnemonic, leaving it for the reader to make his own connections.

The stones that Erickson had shown his grandson came from the gizzard of a dinosaur. They were polished as the dinosaur digested his food. Thus, the grandson was correct in realizing that he had to think about something other than sand, water, ice, or man as the source of the polishing. He had to go outside his usual ways of thinking in order to solve that problem. Erickson is telling his readers and listeners that they must go outside of their usual ways of thinking. The riddle about the stones is not related to the other one, except that they are both riddles.

If the reader has not yet made the connection, he might try counting the number of letters in each word of “How I want a drink…” That’s right! Pi is 3.14159265358979…
