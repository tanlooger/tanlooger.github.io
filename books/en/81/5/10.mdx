title: BOLO TIE
---




All our life we learn to place limits on so many things. I can think of Bill Folsey, a KOOL-TV newsman. On a trip to Chicago he went to a restaurant, where the headwaiter informed him that he would have to wear a tie—and not that bolo tie that Bill was wearing. Bill asked the headwaiter, “What did you pay for your tie?”

The waiter said, very proudly, “Twenty-five dollars.”

And Bill said, “My tie cost two hundred dollars.”

The waiter didn’t know what to think. And Bill Folsey walked into the restaurant and took a seat where he chose to sit—while the waiter tried to give that some thought. That odd-looking thing that Bill Folsey had on! A two-hundred-dollar tie! While his was only a twenty-five-dollar one.

So, have a dream. And, every time you dream, you have the right and the privilege of redreaming that dream, with another cast of characters. And, in that way, you can discover many things you’ve been trained not to know. Your teachers, a long time ago, told you, “Look at me when you are speaking to me. Look at me when I’m speaking to you.” And you learned, “Don’t do this, and don’t do that. Wear the right clothes, the right shoes. Tie your shoe strings right.” So much of our learning is based upon limited instructions that bar us from our own development of our understanding—and we get into patterns of being limited.

I taught my sons how to hoe a potato patch—by making designs. And all the time they are making designs with their hoes and hoeing the potato patch, they are wondering what their last design will be. So, my sons learned to hoe a potato patch by hoeing triangles, and more and more triangles, and, on their own, they discovered that they could hoe circles and numbers, and letters.

And it is wonderful, to have a night’s sleep, a sound and restful sleep—and not find out until next week that you have dreamed that night. You didn’t know about that dream—until a week later.




The comments that Erickson made after the tale of the bolotie might seem to be irrelevant. Actually, they are his way of repeating and driving home the main points in his tale. The first point is that we are limited in our patterns of understanding and action. (“Wear the right clothes…So much of our learning is based upon limited instructions.”) The second point is that we can replace our limited, and limiting, instructions with new patterns—of our own devising (“circles and numbers, and letters”). Finally, Erickson frames his comments with the suggestion that the listener should discover new patterns in a dream. He should trust his unconscious mind to devise novel ways of overcoming habitual limitations.
