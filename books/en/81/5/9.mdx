title: DRY BEDS
---




As in Sufi tales or Zen stories, the recipient of the knowledge of the healer must be in a state of readiness to receive. In many of those stories the supplicant comes to the master but is refused entry until “the vehicle is ready to receive the riches of the teaching.” Erickson often accomplishes this preparation by causing the listener or the patient to wait a long time before he delivers his “punch line.” For example, when he presented the next tale to a group of students, he spent about one-half hour in building up to the final prescription. Some of this time was spent in outlining the background history. Some was spent in asking the listeners how they would treat such a patient. Some time was spent in telling other stories, not directly related to the problem. He repeated such phrases as “There is something that you know but don’t know that you know. When you know what it is that you don’t know you know, then you will be able to have a permanently dry bed.” This type of puzzling and yet intriguing statement causes the listeners to do what Ernest Rossi has called an “inner search.” The listener is thus already beginning to search inside himself for resources that may help in the healing process. When we consider one of Erickson’s induction technique, the “waiting technique,” the same principle applies. The patient literally is left begging for more. Then he is ready to receive.




A mother brought her eleven-year-old daughter in to see me. As soon as I heard about her bed-wetting, I sent the mother out of the room with the belief that the girl could tell me her story. The girl told me that she had a bladder infection in very early infancy, that she was treated by a urologist, and that the infection had persisted for five or six years, maybe longer. She had been cystoscoped regularly, hundreds of times, and eventually the focus of the infection was found in one kidney. That had been removed and she had been free of infections for about four years. She had been cystoscoped so many hundreds of times, and her bladder and sphincter were so stretched, that she wet the bed every night, as soon as her bladder relaxed in her sleep. During the day she could forcibly control her bladder, unless she laughed. The relaxation that goes with laughter caused her to wet her pants.

Her parents thought that since she had had her kidney removed and had been free of the infection for several years, she ought to learn to control herself. She had three younger sisters, who called her bad names and ridiculed her. All of the mothers knew that she wet her bed. And all the schoolchildren, two or three thousand of them, knew that she was a bed wetter and that she wet her pants when she laughed. So she was the butt of much ridicule.

She was very tall, very pretty, blond, with long hair that reached down to her waist. She was really a very charming girl. She was ostracized, ridiculed; more was demanded of her than she could produce. She had to endure the pity of neighbors and the ridicule of her sisters and the schoolchildren. She couldn’t go to slumber parties or spend the night with relatives because of her bed-wetting. I asked her if she had seen any other doctors. She said that she had seen a lot of them, had swallowed a barrel full of pills and a barrel full of medicine, and nothing helped.

I told her that I was like all the other doctors. I couldn’t help her either. “But you already know something but you don’t know that you know it. As soon as you find out what it is that you already know and don’t know that you know, you can begin having a dry bed.”

Then I told her, “I am going to ask you a very simple question and I want a very simple answer. Now, here’s the question. If you were sitting in the bathroom, urinating, and a strange man poked his head in the doorway, what would you do?”

“I’d freeze!”

“That’s right. You’d freeze—and stop urinating. Now, you know what you already knew, but didn’t know that you already knew it. Namely, that you can stop urinating at any time for any stimulus you choose. You really don’t need a strange man poking his head in the bathroom. Just the idea of it is enough. You’ll stop. You’ll freeze. And when he goes away you will start urinating.

“Now, having a dry bed is a very difficult job. You might have your first dry bed in two weeks. And there has to be a lot of practice, starting and stopping. Some days you may forget to practice starting and stopping. That’s all right. Your body will be good to you. It will always give you further opportunities. And some days you may be too busy to practice starting and stopping, but that’s all right. Your body will always give you opportunities to start and stop. It would surprise me very much if you had a permanently dry bed within three months. It would also surprise me if you didn’t have a permanently dry bed within six months. And the first dry bed will be much easier than two dry beds in succession. And three dry beds in succession is much harder. And four dry beds in succession is still harder. After that it gets easier. You can have five, six, seven, a whole week of dry beds. And then you can know that you can have one week of dry beds and another week of dry beds.”

I took my time with the girl. I had nothing else to do. I spent an hour and a half with her and dismissed her. About two weeks later she brought in this present for me—the first present she had ever given with the knowledge that she had had a dry bed (it was a knitted purple cow). I value that present. And six months later she was staying overnight at friends’, relatives’, at slumber parties, in a hotel. Because it is the patient who does the therapy. I didn’t think it was the family that needed therapy, even though the parents were impatient, the sisters called her bad names, the schoolchildren ridiculed her. My feeling was that her parents would have to adjust to her dry beds. So would her sisters and the schoolchildren—and the neighbors. In fact, I saw no other course for them. I didn’t think it was necessary to explain anything to the father, the mother, the sisters, or anybody else. I had told her what she already knew but didn’t know that she knew.

And all of you have grown up with the idea that when you empty your bladder you empty it all the way. And you assume that. The important thing is that all of you have had the experience of being interrupted and shutting off a stream of urine very suddenly. Everybody has that experience—and she had forgotten it. All I did was remind her of something she already knew but didn’t know she knew it.

In other words, in doing therapy you regard your patient as an individual and no matter how much of a problem her bed-wetting was to her parents, her sisters, neighbors and school children, it was primarily her problem. And all she needed to know was something she already knew—and the therapy for all the others was letting them make their own adjustments.

Psychotherapy should be an orientation to the patient and an orientation to the primary problem itself. And remember this. That all of us have our individual language, and that when you listen to a patient, you should listen knowing that he is speaking an alien language and that you should not try to understand in terms of your language. Understand the patient in his language.




This is one of my favorite Erickson tales, perhaps because Erickson would almost always introduce it with a comment such as “You will be especially interested in this story, Sid.” I puzzled for a long time before I could find his message to me and finally was able to extract two main ones.

The first is that I can learn control of thoughts, of working energies, and of symptoms, such as anxiety. I must do this, however, not by willpower, but by discovering which stimuli are necessary to induce me to “start and stop.” Then I must take the opportunities to practice “starting and stopping.”

The second message is that “all of you have grown up with the idea that when you empty your bladder, you empty it all the way.” In the version of this tale that was published in A Teaching Seminar with Milton H. Erickson, edited by Jeffrey Zeig, Erickson added some extra sentences that make this second point even clearer. “All she needed to know was that she could stop her urination at any time, with the right stimulus.” And, “We grow up thinking that we have got to finish. That isn’t true, that we must continue until we are finished.” I have found this attitude to be a great help in accomplishing such tasks as writing. The coercive feeling that we must finish can easily block spontaneity and creativity. A far more effective way of getting something done is by “starting and stopping,” according to one’s inner rhythm. I have found this story to be effective in helping patients overcome blockages, such as writer’s block.
