title: SIGHT-SEEING
---




A woman said she wanted me to do something about her weight. I looked at her fingernails. She had long, red fingernails. I think they’re advertised as “Nails.” You glue them on. They stick out. That amount of fat and those red fingernails!

I said, “I can help you, but you’ll have to cooperate. You climb Squaw Peak.”

She said, “At sunrise?”

I said, “Yes.”

She said, “Well, I’d like some company.”

I said, “You complain that your sixteen-year-old son is about a hundred pounds overweight. Take him along for company. Set a good example for him.”

Next time I saw her she said, “You know, I don’t believe I want to lose weight and I know my son doesn’t. Do you mind if I stop trying to fool myself?”

I said, “Not at all.”




Another woman called me up and said, “I’m ashamed to come in to see you. For the last two years I’ve neglected my husband, my family, my children. I’ve sat in the kitchen and eaten everything I could lay my hands on. My husband takes the children to school and brings them back. He does all the shopping and I cook and eat things. I’m grossly overweight. I don’t even want you to be able to see me.”

I said, “You want to lose the weight. You’ve neglected your children and your husband for two years. In that case why don’t you take your children out of school? They won’t lose anything by it. Your husband’s income is sufficient for you to have a car of your own. Take your children out of school; put them in the station wagon and sightsee all over Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, California, and every other cotton-pickin’ place you can think of. And make your kids read brochures, historical and geographical brochures, on your sight-seeing trip. Stay in motels where you can’t take charge of the kitchen. You’ll be too busy looking after your kids to eat. On your husband’s present income, he can join you every weekend. The family can really enjoy a vacation for a year.”

A year later she called up and said, “I’m back to normal weight. I’m interested in my kids. I love my husband and I want to return to my household duties. Do I have to do any more sight-seeing?”

I said, “Not until you gain weight.”

She said, “Don’t worry, Doctor. I’ve had my fill. Now I want to watch my kids grow and I want to look after my home. Motels are deadly. The kids enjoyed them, but I have a right to be home. I’m going to protect that right.”

I never got a fee out of her and I never met her. But therapy was done on the entire family without my even seeing them. When you touch the vital spot in your patient, your patient either is going to respond and get better or not.




We have just seen three different ways in which Erickson handled problems of overweight. In each case, he found a different area on which to focus his attention and the attention of the patient. Of course, in all three successful cases, the element of motivation was important, and he determined this in the beginning. In the case of the woman who was not motivated, this was also easily determined when she would not follow the simple suggestion of climbing Squaw Peak. Erickson had already guessed that she was lazy and self-indulgent when he saw her general demeanor, which included the ostentatious, artificial fingernails.

In the next two tales the element of motivation is also of central importance.
