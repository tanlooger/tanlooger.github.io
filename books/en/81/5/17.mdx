title: START THE BALL ROLLING
---




Now, a twelve-year-old girl is not a child. I had one on whom I illustrated a purely childish technique. She called me up on the phone and said, “I had infantile paralysis and I have forgotten how to move my arms. Can you hypnotize me and teach me?”

I told her mother to bring her over and her mother brought her over. I looked at the girl. For a twelve-year-old girl she had a very well developed bust, except that the right breast was under her arm. I had the mother strip the girl to her waist and I looked over her entire torso to see what the muscles were.

I told her that three times a day she ought to sit in front of a mirror, nude to the waist, and make faces at herself.

Now, will you draw down the corner of both sides of your mouth?

Now, do it again and feel the skin of your chest move. I can do it on only one side of my face.

And I told her to sit in front of a mirror three times a day, twenty minutes, and draw down the corners of her mouth. In other words, contract the platysma muscle.

And she asked me, “Do I have to sit in front of a mirror?”

I said, “Where would you like to sit?”

She said, “I’d like to imagine a TV program.”

And so she was watching an imaginary program on an imaginary TV. And she started exercising the platysma muscles, and she enjoyed watching the imaginary TV while making faces.

Now, when you start one muscle moving there’s a tendency for that to spread to other muscles. You try to move just one finger. You start to spread the movement, unintentionally. Her arms began to move.

Now, the right breast migrated from under her arm to one side of her chest. She is now a lawyer, practicing law.




Erickson’s comments about this case are sufficiently explanatory. Again he initiates a small change, apparently quite peripheral to the target problem, which was inability to move the arms. He simply uses his knowledge of anatomy indirectly, to cause the patient to contract her chest muscles, which of course are connected to the arms (especially the pectoralis major). Why didn’t he simply tell the girl to practice using her arm muscles? He knew that she had developed too much resistance, which would make such a direct approach useless. But how could she resist such an indirect approach?
