title: WALKING ON GLARE ICE
---




During the war I worked at the induction board in Detroit. One day, as I was going to the induction board, I saw a veteran who had returned with an artificial leg, looking at some glare ice and eyeing it suspiciously because he knew that he was likely to fall on glare ice.

“That’s very smooth ice,” I told him. “Stand where you are. I’ll come over and teach you how to walk on glare ice.”

He could see that I had a limp, so he knew I must be talking about what I knew. He watched me walk across that glare ice and asked, “How did you do it?”

I said, “I won’t tell you, I’ll teach you. Now, you just keep your eyes totally shut.” And I turned him around, and walked him back and forth on the ice-free sidewalk. I kept walking him back and forth over longer distances and then shorter and shorter distances until finally I noticed his utter confusion. Finally, I got him clear across to the other side of that glare ice.

I said, “Open your eyes.”

He said, “Where is that glare ice?”

I said, “It’s behind you.”

He said, “How did I get over here?”

I said, “Now you can understand. You walked as if the cement was bare. When you try to walk on ice the usual tendency is to tense your muscles, preparing for a fall. You get a mental set. And you slip that way.

“If you put the weight of your legs down straight, the way you would on dry cement, you wouldn’t slip. The slide comes because you don’t put down your full weight and because you tense yourself.”

It took me a long time to find that out. Did you ever walk upstairs one step too many? What an awful jolt it is! Walk downstairs one too many—you can break your leg. And yet you are totally unaware of that set.




Here, Erickson demonstrates his classical method of helping a person out of a fixed mental set. The first step is to confuse the subject. The second step, during this confused period, is to lead the subject over the obstacle so that the subject has an experience of success. Of course, in this case, the experience of success occurred when the subject failed to respond with his usual tightening, with his usual mental set. The old set is replaced with a new one. The patient believes he can walk across glare ice. He now approaches new “slippery” situations without carrying over the fear associated with previous “falls.”

Sometimes, it is important for the patient to not use things he knows or perceptions that he ordinarily would use. For this reason, Erickson has the man close his eyes. Once the man had stopped seeing, he could accomplish the task. Seeing had previously caused him to have a kinesthetic reaction that caused him to adopt the wrong set.

Erickson liked to illustrate hypnotic concentration by asking people, “If I were to put a board one foot wide and fifty feet long on the floor, would you have any difficulty walking along it?” Of course, the answer would be “no.” He would then add, “What would be your reaction if I were to put the same board—one foot wide and fifty feet long—between two buildings reaching across from the fiftieth floor of one to the fiftieth floor of the other?” Again, in this example, the visual sense is associated with a kinesthetic set that would lead most people to lose their sense of security. To succeed in this task, or in walking a tightrope, it may be important to not use something you have—that is, your visual sense (and your imagination).
