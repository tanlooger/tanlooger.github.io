title: DONALD LAWRENCE AND THE GOLD MEDAL
---




Donald Lawrence had been practicing the shot put for a whole year. The coach at the high school had voluntarily coached him, without charge, for a whole year, every night. Donald was six feet six inches, 260 pounds, and didn’t have an ounce of fat on him, and the coach had a great ambition to get a national high-school record for the shot put. At the end of the year the high-school contest was two weeks away and Donald could only put the shot fifty-eight feet—far short of the record.

His father was interested. He brought Donald in to see me. I told Donald to sit down and go into a trance. I told him to levitate his hand and to learn to feel his muscles all over and then to come in the next time, go into a trance, and listen to me. I asked him if he knew that a mile used to be four minutes long and that Roger Bannister had broken the record—after the record had stood for many, many years. I asked him if he knew how Bannister had done this.

I said, “Well, Bannister, who was acquainted with sports of all kinds, realized that you can win a ski run by a hundredth of a second, by a tenth of a second; and then he began to realize that a four-minute mile would be 240 seconds. If he could run it in 239 and five-tenths of a second he would break the four-minute mile. Having thought that through, he broke the four-minute-mile record.”

And I said, “You have already thrown the shot fifty-eight feet. And, Donald, tell me honestly, do you think you know the difference between fifty-eight feet and fifty-eight feet and one-sixteenth of an inch?”

He said, “No, of course not.”

I said, “Fifty-eight feet and fifty-eight feet and one-eighth of an inch?”

He said, “No.”

And I brought it up to fifty-eight feet and fifty-nine feet and he could not tell the difference. I had a couple more sessions in which I slowly enlarged the possibility. And two weeks later he set a national high-school record.

That summer he came in and said, “I am going to the Olympics; I want some advice.”

I said, “The Olympic record for the shot put is just under sixty-two feet. You are just an eighteen-year-old kid. It would be all right if you bring home the bronze medal. And don’t bring home the silver or the gold. Because then you will be competing against yourself. Let Perry and O’Bryan take the gold and silver.”

Perry and O’Bryan did. And Donald came home with a bronze medal.

Then the Olympics were in Mexico City. Donald came in and said, “I am going to Mexico City.”

I said, “You are four years older now, Donald. It would be all right if you take the gold medal.” And he came home with the gold medal.

He was going to Tokyo and asked, “What shall I do in Tokyo?”

I said, “Athletic accomplishments require time for maturing. Take the gold medal again.”

He came home with it, and he entered college to study dentistry. There he found out that he was eligible for two meets that he wanted to enter. He came in and said, “The college meet is coming up; it’s official. What shall I do about the shot put?”

I said, “Donald, people always restrict themselves. In the shot put in the Olympics they restricted themselves for years and years to less than sixty-two feet. Frankly, I don’t know how far a shot can be put. I am certain it can be put sixty-two feet. I even wonder if it can be put seventy feet. So why don’t you reach a record mark, somewhere between sixty-two feet and seventy feet?” I think he placed it sixty-five feet, six inches.

The next time he came in and asked, “Now what do I do?”

I said, “Donald, you showed that the longtime Olympic record was very wrong, by getting it up to sixty-five feet. And that’s just the first try. Next time see how close you can get it to seventy feet.”

Donald said, “All right.”

He placed it sixty-eight feet, ten inches.

I told the coach at Texas A & M all about Donald Lawrence, how I trained him. The coach listened very carefully and said, “I am training Masterson for the shot put.”

When the coach told Masterson how I had trained Donald Lawrence, Masterson said, “If that’s the way Erickson trained Donald Lawrence to set a record, I am going to see how much farther I can put it than Donald Lawrence.”

He placed it seventy feet. I think it is up to seventy feet and four inches now.




Erickson then switches to golf:




In golf, actually, you hit the first hole and reach the second hole in a correct number of shots. Then the question arises, “Can you do as well on the third hole?” Therefore, on every hole you think it’s the first. You let the caddy keep count of which hole.

One contestant came to me and said, “I shoot in the low seventies and I want to win the state championship before I go into professional golfing. I want to win the amateur championship of Arizona. But every tournament I enter, I wind up with a score in the nineties. Playing alone I can get down to the low seventies.”

I put him into a trance and told him, “You will play only the first hole. That’s all you will remember. And you will be alone on the golf course.”

He played in the next state tournament. After the eighteenth hole he walked toward another hole, and somebody stopped him and told him, “You have played the eighteenth hole.” And he said, “No, I just played the first hole.” Then he said, “Where did all these people come from?”




We can note the way Erickson uses truisms to give suggestions. “You’re four years older now, Donald. It would be all right if you take the gold medal.” The first statement is true; the second part of the statement could be true. By juxtaposing them, Erickson equates one with the other. By suggesting to Donald that he first bring home the bronze medal, he is demonstrating an inordinate amount of control—a pinpoint control. This kind of control is even better than winning first place. When, four years later, Erickson suggests that it is all right for Donald to get the gold medal, this had been predicated on previous demonstrations of control. Finally, it is important with this story, more than with some of the others, to remember that Donald Lawrence is a real person and that he actually has won Olympic championships. Only his name is disguised, along with minor facts. This kind of beneficial effect was neither purely theoretical nor was it a fantasy of Erickson’s. Donald was able to make his progress step by step. Erickson started by reminding him of something he already knew: Roger Bannister had broken the record for the four-minute mile. How did Bannister do this? By changing his way of thinking. He changed the four minutes to 240 seconds, and then he could deal with seconds instead of minutes. Erickson’s strategy was then to get Donald to think about things in a different way. Once he changed his thinking, like Roger Bannister, he was able to overcome the psychological block. Erickson also makes a small change—the difference between fifty-eight feet and fifty-eight feet and one-sixteenth of an inch. He makes a small change, and then he builds upon that change.

Each problem carries a past and a future. What Erickson realizes is that if you eliminate the past and change the future, you’ve changed two-thirds of the problem. Therefore, if you think about each hole as being the first, there is no anxiety from the past. You have eliminated the past and you can change the future because the future can only be one of positive expectancy.

These two tales have been very helpful to me when I convey the idea to patients that the answer to dependence upon another person is to extend one’s own capabilities and limits. This is much more meaningful than simply telling them that they must learn to stand on their own two feet, which is what everybody else has been telling them.
