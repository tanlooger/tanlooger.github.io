title: CLAUSTROPHOBIA

Another patient had claustrophobia. She couldn’t bear to be shut up in a small room. Her mother had punished her as a child by putting her in the outdoor entrance to the cellar, closing the door, and then clicking her heels as she walked down the street, deserting the girl. She had clicked her heels on the sidewalk, making the girl think she was going far, far away.

And the girl grew up with an absolute phobia for small rooms. So I asked her to sit in the closet of my office.

She said, “I’ll only do that if the door’s wide open.”

I said, “Suppose instead of having the door wide open it lacks one millimeter of being wide open?”

And she agreed. She stayed in the closet with the door wide open, except for one millimeter. And then we worked up to two millimeters, three millimeters, a centimeter, half an inch, an inch. And how open did she have to have that door?

So she stood in the closet and slowly closed the door. I waited to see when her panic would develop. She found she was comfortable even when the door was only a half an inch open and she kept her hand on the door knob. Finally she closed it and found out she could live and breathe in that closet with the door closed, as long as she had the doorknob in her hand.

Then I suggested she might try looking through the keyhole. Since she could see outside through the keyhole, she didn’t have to hang on to the doorknob any longer.




Claustrophobia is a syndrome that graphically expresses the limitations that have developed in a person. There are many theories about the cause of this and other phobias, but Erickson does not concern himself with them. His concern is to help the sufferer eliminate his stifling feeling of constriction, to move beyond his phobic limitations.

Erickson is telling us to deal with difficult problems bit by bit—first imagine, then gradually close one door. Then do the same with another door, with a window…
