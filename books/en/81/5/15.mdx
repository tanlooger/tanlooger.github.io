title: YOUR ALCOHOLIC HAS TO BE SINCERE
---




A very wealthy man came to see me and said, “I’m an alcoholic. I want to quit.”

I said, “Well, there are a few things I’d like to know about you. Are you married?”

He said, “Yes, very much married.”

“What do you mean, ‘very much married’?”

“Well, we own a summer cottage, ten miles from nowhere. It’s a beautiful place. I could afford to have it fixed up beautifully. My wife and I often spend two or three weeks there. We can catch trout from a trout stream by putting our poles out the bedroom window. There’s no telephone. We’re ten miles from civilization. It’s beautifully furnished. Every kind of food and booze that can be bought is there. And every summer my wife and I spend about three, two or three weeks there in the nude, really enjoying life.”

I said, “All right, it will be very easy for you to cease to be an alcoholic. Have your wife drive up to the cabin, collect all the booze, and put it in the car. Put your clothes in the car too. Remove any other clothes that are there and bring them back to Phoenix.

“She can have a friend drive her up there at night and she can turn over all her clothes to her friend. And the two of you can have a delightful two weeks, three weeks, living on trout and being free of booze. I know you won’t walk over the desert for ten miles to get a bottle of booze.”

He said, “Doctor, I think I’m mistaken about wanting to quit drinking.”

But that would have been the perfect way. And your alcoholic has to be sincere.




In his use of the phrase “your alcoholic,” Erickson is underlining his belief that a therapist, once having accepted a patient, assumes a great deal of responsibility for that patient’s progress. If you, as a therapist, accept an alcoholic as a patient, he becomes “your alcoholic.” Since the man in this story refused to follow Erickson’s prescription, he was not accepted as a patient and remained his own alcoholic.
