title: A FLASH OF COLOR
---




A patient came to me and said, “I’ve lived in Phoenix for the past fifteen years and I have hated every moment of those fifteen years. My husband has offered me a vacation in Flagstaff. I hate Phoenix so much, but I have refused to go to Flagstaff. I prefer to stay in Phoenix and to hate being in Phoenix.”

So I told her, while she was in a trance, that she would be curious about hating Phoenix and about why she punished herself so much. That should be a very big curiosity. “And there is another thing to be curious about—and very, very curious about. If you go to Flagstaff for a week, you will see, very unexpectedly, a flash of color.” As long as she had a big curiosity about hating Phoenix, she could develop an equally large curiosity, just as compelling, to find out what that flash of color would be in Flagstaff.

She went to Flagstaff for a week, but stayed a month. What flash of color did she see? I had none in mind. I just wanted her to be curious. And when she saw that flash of color, she was so elated that she remained a whole month in Flagstaff. That flash of color was a redheaded woodpecker flying past an evergreen tree. This woman usually spends the summer in Flagstaff now, but she also has gone to the East Coast to see the color there. She has gone to Tucson, to see a flash of color. She has gone to New York, to see a flash of color. She has gone to Europe, to see a flash of color. And my statement that she would see a flash of color was based only upon the fact that you have to see a lot of things that ordinarily you don’t see. And I wanted her to keep looking. And she would find something to translate into my words.




This set of instructions, which was included in a hypnotic induction, was used to help the listener overcome habitual limitations. The overt suggestions and permission for the overcoming of these limitations are obvious. I have italicized certain words, which Erickson “marked” by emphasizing them with a change of tone. These words, such as “keep looking,” are obvious instructions presented in an embedded way to encourage looking into one’s own unconscious repertory. Very often, after one of these words was marked, he paused, sometimes for as long as three or four minutes, to allow time for this inner work to take place. At the same time he includes posthypnotic suggestions, which would lead to a dream, perhaps a week later.

Bandler and Grinder might point out Erickson’s switches of “representational systems” in this story. The patient begins kinesthetically by stating that she prefers to stay in Phoenix and to hate being in Phoenix. Erickson changes her representational system to a visual one, using, as a bridge, her curiosity. He dislodges her from her hate to curiosity, which decreases the hate. Then he moves the curiosity to something visual. In this way he goes stepwise from the kinesthetic to the visual.

Even though Erickson himelf could not appreciate color—he was color-blind—he used color just as he used sound and poetry (which he also could not appreciate, because he was tone deaf and lacked a sense of rhythm), because he knew that other people could appreciate these elements. Jeffrey Zeig has pointed out that by moving a patient beyond a limitation that he himself has, Erickson is encouraging the patient to “leave him in the dust.” This is a nice way to emphasize individual differences. Also, if that particular patient is a “one-up” type of person, it gives him an opportunity to be even more “one-up.”

He can have something that even Erickson can’t.
