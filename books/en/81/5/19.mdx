title: THE STARS ARE THE LIMIT
---




A professor of astronomy came in to see me during the winter. He left the front door open. He left my office door open and opened the two other doors in my office.

He opened the shades to one window. He rolled up the blind, pulled up the shade, and opened the window.

He said, “I’ve been picked by the government to photograph the total eclipse in Borneo and I suffer from claustrophobia. “To get to Borneo I’ve got to fly, and ride on a train. I’ve got to travel by ship, by motorcar. I’ve got to be able to work in a darkroom. Can you fix me up? I’ve got two months before I have to leave.”

So I had him imagine that one of the doors was closed, even though it was actually wide open. Finally he managed to imagine that while under hypnosis. I then had him imagine that the other door was closed, that the window was closed, and that the front door to the office was closed.

He went to Borneo to photograph the total eclipse of the sun.

After he had succeeded, in a trance state, in imagining that the door was closed, I actually closed it, just a little bit at a time, until it finally was closed. One by one I closed every door, after first having him imagine it was closed. And it all started by having him imagine that the door was closed. I’d called that open door a crack in the wall. I said, “Now let’s close that crack, a bit at a time, into a solid wall.”

Now, if you had claustrophobia, you’d want the windows open and the doors open. I’d put you in a trance and have you see a wide crack here. And, no matter how bad your claustrophobia was, you could stand sitting on that couch with all the windows open and that door open. And, when I alter the mental picture that you have, you’ll relate to it the way you do to the wall behind you.

And that’s the advantage of hypnosis. You can have people in a trance state imagine effectively that such and such a doorway is actually a crack in a wall. And they will have a wall behind them. Now, the windows and doors must be open. When they change into cracks in the wall, slowly close the cracks.

After he got to Borneo and photographed the eclipse, the man entered his darkroom and developed pictures. Because he desperately wanted to see the land of Borneo, or wherever it was.

The next winter his wife came to see me and said, “Thank goodness this winter I won’t have to sleep with all the doors and all the windows open.”




In this claustrophobia case Erickson again helps the patient gradually to tolerate more and more “closedness,” While the desensitization was done in actuality in the first case, it was first done in fantasy in the case of the astronomy professor. The fantasy experience was then confirmed when Erickson actually closed the doors. Erickson not only closes actual doors, after first leaving them open, but he also, via hypnotic suggestion, produces a “wide crack” in a solid wall. He demonstrates that he can take over control of the patient’s phobic feelings as well as his perceptions—by producing and removing such visual hallucinations. He ties in the hallucination of the wide crack with a feeling of openness—associated with “you could stand sitting on that couch with all the windows open and that door open.” Then, when he “alters the mental picture,” he can suggest that the feeling of safety and comfort will remain, even after the “wide crack” is removed.
