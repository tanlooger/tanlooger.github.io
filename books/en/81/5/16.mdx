title: A FRIENDLY DIVORCE
---




Here’s a case where I saw the husband only once. And that’s because I got sick. I couldn’t see anybody for two months.

A husband came to me and he said, “I’m an only child. My father’s a minister in a very narrow Christian church. I’ve been brought up to think that smoking is a sin, going to the theater is a sin. In fact, I’ve been brought up on sin. There’s very little you can do. I’ve been careful in medical school not to commit a sin. I met the only daughter of another minister of the same Christian sect, and she’s been brought up in the same way that I was. We fell in love. Our parents were delighted and they planned a wonderful wedding for us. They chipped in to pay for our honeymoon in the same hotel that one set of parents had had their honeymoon in. It was 142 miles away from where we lived.

“It was midwinter in Indiana and the temperature was below zero. We had an evening wedding and a nice reception afterwards. Somewhere about ten, eleven o’clock my wife and I got in the car and headed for that hotel, 142 miles away. By the time we got two miles away the heater in the car broke down and when we arrived at that hotel 142 miles away I practically froze. We were miserable, and we were tired. The car had broken down and I didn’t know if I would be able to fix it. I also had to change the spare tire.

“When we got there we went up to our room and I opened the door. We stood there looking at each other.

“We both knew what we had to do, but we were so tired, so miserable, so cold. My wife settled it. She picked up her suitcase, turned on the bathroom light, and turned off the light in the main room. She undressed in the bathroom, turned off the light, and came out in her pajamas. She found her way through the darkness to the bed and crawled in.

“So, I picked up my suitcase, went into the bathroom, turned the lights on, got into my pajamas, turned the lights back off, and then found my way through the darkness to the other side of the bed. And we lay there. We knew what we had to do, but we weren’t trying to figure anything out except how to get over being cold, miserable, and tired.

“We lay there all night trying to get some sleep, trying to make up our minds.

“Finally, by eleven o’clock in the morning we mustered up enough courage to consummate the marriage, and neither of us enjoyed it. During that first intercourse she became pregnant. We have tried to learn to make love to each other since then, but it’s too late. We talked it over, and as soon as she delivers the baby, next month, after her six-weeks checkup, we’re going to get a friendly divorce. I don’t want to be as stupid about the divorce as I was about the marriage. We both regret the way our marriage turned out. I’m going to give her the baby and child support. They’ll go back home. I don’t know where I’ll go.”

I said, “All right. That is such a miserable marriage and you’ve failed to adjust to it. It’s complicated by a pregnancy. I suggest you get a friendly divorce. Now let me explain to you how you do it.”

I told him, “Go down into Detroit and make arrangements for a private dining room and for a room in a hotel. Hire a nurse to look after your child after your wife’s six-week checkup. Explain to your wife that it’s time to set out to have a friendly divorce and there ought to be a friendly separation. You take her to the Hotel Statler; I don’t care what it costs. Have a private dining room and a wonderful dinner, with candles, and, this is a medical order, a bottle of champagne. And you both share in drinking that champagne.

“After you finish dinner—it should not be later than ten o’clock—go to the desk and get the key to your room. The bellboy will take you there. When you get to your floor, hand the bellboy a five-dollar bill and tell him to scram. He’ll know what you mean. Then you walk to your hotel room, unlock the door, pick your bride up, carry her across the threshhold, lock the door while she is still in your arms, and walk over and sit her down on the side of the bed. Then tell her, ‘I’ll have one last good-bye kiss.’ Kiss her gently and remark, ‘That kiss was for you, now let’s have one for me.’ Drop your hand onto her knee, prolong that kiss a little bit, slide your hand and slip off her slipper. Then tell her, ‘Let’s have one more kiss for the two of us.’ You slip your hand under her dress, slide your hand down, and take off her other slipper. Then, with the champagne and your endocrine glands and hers, things’ll start to shape up. Unzip her blouse and kiss her again. Take off one stocking, kiss her again.”

I gave him a complete outline on how to seduce his wife. By summer I had recovered from my illness and both of them had disappeared. Some years later I was lecturing at Emory University. A young man said, “We’d very much like to have you dine with us.”

I said, “I’m sorry, my plane ticket makes it impossible.”

He said, “She’ll be very disappointed.”

I wondered why a strange family would be disappointed.

He said, “You look as if you don’t recognize me.”

I said, “That’s right, I don’t.”

He said, “You undoubtedly remember a dinner you recommended for my wife and myself at the Statler Hotel in Detroit.”

I said, “Yes, I do.”

He said, “We now have two children and a third on the way.”

When people come to you wanting a divorce, maybe they don’t.




The couple in this tale are similar, in many ways, to the young woman in “Sin.” Because of their rigid, constricting upbringing, they require very clear directive guidance in overcoming their learned limitations. They are also sufficiently respectful of authority to follow such a directive approach. But, we may wonder, “Why does Erickson tell this story to us? We are certainly sophisticated enough to know how to seduce a woman. Is there, perhaps, some secret message in the story?”

Of course there is. There are many messages. The most obvious one is that, once again, your best chance of enabling someone to change his responses is to tell him to do what he already is doing or, as in this case, is planning to do. Then you inject some difference, such as a change of scene and atmosphere. You don’t hesitate to give directions or supply information. (If you are the subject you get relevant information.)

The main point of this story is Erickson’s belief that we all have the capacity and resources within us to resolve problems and differences. Sometimes all we need is the stimulus of a slight change.
