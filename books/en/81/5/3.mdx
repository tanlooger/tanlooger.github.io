title: I WIN OLYMPIC CHAMPIONSHIPS ALL THE TIME
---




I asked Erickson about a patient of mine who is a concert pianist. He was fearful that he would freeze at the keyboard and that he would be unable to play because of arthritis in his hands. Erickson’s response was as follows:




A pianist, no matter how bad his hands get, knows music. And he knows how to compose. And that’s one thing he should never forget. A hand may get useless, but he can compose, and compose even better. Out of a wheelchair I win Olympic championships all the time.
