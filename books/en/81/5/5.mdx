title: TRAINING THE U.S. RIFLE TEAM TO BEAT THE RUSSIANS
---




The coach of the advanced marksmanship team of the army got to reading about hypnosis and decided that hypnosis could help his team beat the Russians. The teams were training in Georgia. They had been in a shoot in San Francisco and they stopped in Phoenix. The coach brought the team in to see me and asked me if I could train his team to beat the Russians in the international shoot.

I explained to him, “I’ve shot a rifle twice, when I was a teenager. I know the muzzle end and the stock end—that’s all I know about a rifle. Now, these riflemen know all they need to know about a gun. I’m a medical man. I know what I need to know about a body. I’ll train your team. They already have the rifle knowledge and I have the medical knowledge.”

The commandant was so infuriated that a civilian was going to train the rifle team that he added two men who had been trying for two years to make the rifle team. I don’t know what the qualifications were for the rifle team, but it was a score in the sixties. Those two men had been devoting all their spare time to training and scored in the low forties. In other words, they couldn’t make the team.

One of the first things I told the man, after I found that in the contest you shoot forty rounds in succession, was, “I know the first bulls-eye is easy. The question is ‘Can you do it twice?…Can you do it eleven times, after ten successive bulls-eyes?…You’ve done it nineteen times. Will you make it the twentieth time?…The tension is growing—with each successful shot!

“‘You’ve made it twenty-nine times. Can you make it thirty times?…You’ve made it thirty-five times. Thirty-six? Thirty-seven? Thirty-eight? (breathlessly) Thirty-nine? Can I possibly make it forty times?’”

The next thing I did was to call in a good hypnotic subject. I told the subject, “After you awaken you’re going to be offered a cigarette. You’ll want to smoke it. And you’ll gladly accept it. You’ll put it into your mouth and you’ll absentmindedly drop it…and take a second cigarette—not remembering you’ve had the first cigarette.” And so—he accepted 169 cigarettes!

Then they knew that they too could forget. If he could forget 169 cigarettes, then they could forget each one of the forty shots.

Then I told them, “Now you fit the sole of your foot on the ground so that the sole of your foot feels comfortable. Then you make sure your ankle’s comfortable, your calf is comfortable, your knee, your hip joint, your trunk, your left arm; your finger on the trigger; the rifle stock against your shoulder. Get just exactly the right feeling. And then you wave the rifle sight up and down, across the target and back and forth. And, at the right moment, you squeeze the trigger.”

And they beat the Russians, for the first time, at Moscow. And the two men the commandant had thrown in also placed.




While the preceding tale illustrates the establishment of a broader or less limited mental set, this tale illustrates the principle of focusing on the task itself. This was accomplished, not only by the men’s forgetting all preceding shots, but also by their focusing attention on sensations in the body, in the present.
