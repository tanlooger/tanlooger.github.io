title: 12. Manipulation and Future Orientation
---






In his keynote address to the International Congress on Ericksonian Approaches to Hypnosis and Psychotherapy, December 7, 1980, Jay Haley said, “Erickson was really quite comfortable with power. You know, there was a period when people thought there was something wrong with power, but that wasn’t his point of view. He didn’t mind taking it or using it. I recall him saying that he was on a panel and ‘There was no power there so I took over the panel.’ With his willingness to take and use power, I think it is fortunate that he was a benevolent man. If the kind of influence he had was turned to destructive purposes, it would have been most unfortunate. He was not only benevolent, but he was consistently helpful to people, both in and out of his office…. I never had a doubt about his ethics or his benevolent intentions and I wasn’t concerned about his exploiting anyone for any personal advantage.”

It is important to keep Erickson’s “benevolence” in mind when we consider his love of practical jokes. Practical jokes are often used to express thinly disguised hostility, yet in the Erickson family, the “victim” was as amused as the “perpetrator.” The victim is certainly not harmed, although there might be an argument in some situations as to who is the victim. But there is no indication that any of the Erickson jokes originate from or express hostility.

In this chapter, the stories are told as models for “setting up” situations to achieve a planned purpose. In many cases, practical jokes and humorous stories can be seen as prototypes of Erickson’s scheme of therapy. When Erickson practiced therapy, just as when he told or set up a practical joke, he knew the ending. The patient did not. Erickson began with a goal in mind—that of changing the patient’s responses from “sick” or self-destructive to “healthier” or constructive. As the therapist, he manipulated the situation to actualize the goal. Many techniques were used to maintain and build up the interest and motivation of the patient—challenges, stimulation of curiosity, diversionary tactics, and humor.

The essential element in Erickson’s practical jokes was not hostility, but surprise. In his therapy, also, the patient was often surprised, both at “prescriptions” and at his own responses. And, just as the listener experiences a sense of relief at hearing the punch line after the buildup of suspense, the patient was relieved to hear a clear-cut prescription.

Erickson felt that shock and surprise were useful in breaking up rigid mental sets. The surprise did not have to be administered in a sophisticated way. During my first visit with him, in the middle of our conversation, he reached into a drawer and pulled out a small tricycle horn. He squeezed the ball three or four times—toot, toot, toot—and commented, “Surprise always helps.” At the time this seemed a juvenile thing (or him to do, and didn’t seem to have any particular effect on me. However, in retrospect, I believe it contributed to the general atmosphere that enabled me to enter a hypnotic trance and to respond to his suggestions. It kept me off-balance and introduced an element from childhood that he may have used to evoke the childhood memories I was trying to recall.

“Future Orientation” has been included in this chapter because it seems to fit in with planning, and with “manipulation” in the sense in which Erickson uses this word. In the first story, “manipulation” is used where others might use such concepts as “mastery,” “effective action,” or “managing.” A positive attitude toward the future is the best antidote to depression or obsessive thinking—and this is true of the anticipation of amusement at the culmination of a practical joke as well as of the expectation that the passing of time will bring growth.
