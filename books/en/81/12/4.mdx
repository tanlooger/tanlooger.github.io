title: DOLORES
---




One day in June, Bert wrote us from Michigan and ended the letter with “As I close this letter, I’ve got to meet Dolores.” Now, Bert always had a secret, and we knew better than to ask who Dolores was.

Every week or so we got a letter with a one-line mention of Dolores.

“I had dinner with Dolores,” or “I’m going to call on Dolores.” “I got some socks I know Dolores will like.” At the same time he kept up a similar correspondence with my father in Milwaukee, and my father knew better than to ask questions.

In August, Bert wrote, “I ought to send you both some pictures of Dolores.” He said that to my father too. So we waited. In September, Bert wrote us, “I hope Grandpa and Grandma will like Dolores. I’m sure you would and I’ve figured out a way for Grandpa and Grandma to meet Dolores. I’ll go there for Thanksgiving Day dinner.”

Now, Bert had a marvelous gift: He could cross his eyes, stand pigeon-toed, his arms seeming to be barely attached, and get a silly grin on his face that was irritating to look at. It made you want to slap his face. He showed up on Milwaukee at 1 A.M. on a very cold Thanksgiving Day. He came in the house and my father said, “Where is Dolores?”

He looked sillier than ever. “I had trouble getting her on the plane. She isn’t dressed. She’s outside!”

“Why is she outside?”

“She isn’t dressed.”

My mother said, “I’ll get a bathrobe.” My father said, “You go and bring that girl in.”

Bert came in carrying a huge box, obviously heavy. “This was the only way I could get her on the plane. She isn’t properly dressed.”

“Open that box, boy.”

He opened it and there was Dolores—one turkey, one goose—both named Dolores. And Grandpa and Grandma liked Dolores! That had been going on since June!

Don’t ever trust the Ericksons.
