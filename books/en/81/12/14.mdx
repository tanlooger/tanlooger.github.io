title: GLOBUS HYSTERICUS
---




I had a nurse come in. I had known her slightly. She was one of those know-it-all nurses. She’d been discharged from hospital after hospital because she told the doctors what to do. She told them the diagnosis and the treatment.

And she came in and said that she had globus hystericus, a lump in her throat, and it was very distressing. I had her describe the distress. And she described the pain. I reached my own conclusions and said, “You do not have globus hystericus. You have an ulcer of the stomach, at the duodenal end.”

She said, “Don’t be ridiculous.”

I said, “I’m not, you are.”

She said, “I’ll prove to you I don’t have a stomach ulcer.” She went to three different radiologists, all of whom confirmed my diagnosis. And she came back very angry and said, “You’re right. I saw the X rays myself and they all agreed. What are you going to advise me to do?”

I said, “You’re Armenian. You like spicy food. You have a sister who calls you up every day and has a long telephone conversation with you. You have a niece who calls you up every day, has a long telephone conversation. Hang up on your sister and your niece. They both give you a pain in your stomach. And enjoy your food.”

A month later she got new X rays from all three radiologists. No trace of an ulcer. And that was all the recommendation, “Enjoy your food, hang up on your sister and your niece.”

Her favorite expression was “I can’t swallow this, I can’t swallow that.” That’s why she reached the diagnosis of globus hystericus. Her description of the pain indicated it must be a duodenal ulcer. But she knew I was wrong. Three independent radiologists convinced her I was right.




Oddly enough, this “know-it-all” nurse who was so bossy with doctors could not be assertive with her own sister and niece. Erickson sets an example of assertiveness with his own attitude. In fact, in this story he appears to be approaching arrogance as he assumes the “know-it-all” posture. However, he apparently felt that he had to do this in order to persuade this woman to take direction. With another patient, Linda, whose treatment I witnessed, Erickson had given her instructions to climb Squaw Peak. At first she resisted this direction, but then, one day, in the middle of a session in which Erickson was meeting with about ten students, she knocked on the door. She reported that she had climbed Squaw Peak, as he had ordered. Also, as ordered, she came to report this to him. He simply dismissed her, without further comment.

After she had left, the group was interested in why Erickson had asked her to climb Squaw Peak. Did he want her to “get in touch with her own feelings”? Did he want her to accomplish a task successfully? His answer, surprisingly, was “So she would obey me.” Erickson often pointed out that it was important that the therapist direct the treatment. If he could not obtain obedience in at least one specific area, he would feel that there was no point in continuing treatment. In the case of the nurse, it was important for him to know that she would follow his suggestion and actually hang up on her sister and her niece.
