title: DACHSHUND AND GERMAN SHEPHERD
---




One of my students was less than five feet and she asked me if she had done right. She was taking her little puppy, a dachshund, out for a walk one evening. A big German shepherd came roaring down the alley, swearing at her and the puppy, declaring his intent to eat them alive. She grabbed up the puppy and charged the German shepherd, yelling at him. He turned around and went goggy-eyed and ran back home. Because it’s when you do the unexpected thing that you cause a lot of rearrangement in a person’s thinking.
