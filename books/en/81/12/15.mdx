title: OATS

I spent one summer grubbing up brush on ten acres of land. My father plowed it that fall and replanted it, replowed it in the spring, and planted it into oats. And the oats grew very well and we hoped to get an excellent crop. Late that summer, on a Thursday evening, we went over to see how that crop was getting along, when we could harvest it. My father examined the individual oat stalks and said, “Boys, this is not going to be a bumper crop of thirty-three bushels per acre. It will be at least a hundred bushels per acre. And they will be ready to harvest next Monday.”

And we were walking along happily thinking about a thousand bushels of oats and what it meant to us financially. It started to sprinkle. It rained all night Thursday, all day Friday, all night Friday, all day Saturday, all night Saturday, all day Sunday, and in the early morning on Monday the rain ceased. When we were finally able to wade through the water to that back field, the field was totally flat; there weren’t any upright oats.

My father said, “I hope enough of the oats are ripe enough so that they will sprout. In that way we will have some green feed for the cattle this fall—and next year is another year.”

And that’s really being oriented to the future, and very, very necessary in farming.




This theme—that tomorrow is another day, that the sun will rise again tomorrow, that no matter what happens it is not the end of the world, that no matter how flattened out you feel there’s always the basis for some new growth and fresh beginnings—is a common one in the teaching tales. It’s a great source of inspiration and it is certainly an effective antidote to self-pity.
