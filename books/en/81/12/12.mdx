title: RUTH

At Worcester Hospital, the superintendent remarked one day, “I wish somebody could find some way of handling Ruth.”

I inquired about Ruth, a very pretty, petite twelve-year-old girl, very winning in her ways. You couldn’t help liking her. She was so nice in her behavior. And all the nurses warned every new nurse who came to work there, “Keep away from Ruth. She’ll tear your dress; break your arm or your foot!”

The new nurses didn’t believe that of sweet, winsome twelve-year-old Ruth. And Ruth would beg the new nurse, “Oh, would you please bring me an ice-cream cone and some candy from the store?”

The nurse would do it and Ruth would accept the candy and thank the nurse very sweetly, and with a single karate chop break the nurse’s arm, or rip her dress off, or kick her in the shins, or jump on her foot. Standard, routine behavior for Ruth. Ruth enjoyed it. She also liked to tear the plaster off the walls periodically.

I told the superintendent I had an idea, and asked if I could handle the case. He listened to my ideas and said, “I think that will work, and I know just the nurse who’ll be glad to help you.”

One day I got a call. “Ruth is on a binge again.” I went to the ward. Ruth had torn the plaster off the walls. I tore off the bed clothes. I helped her destroy the bed. I helped her break windows. I had spoken to the hospital engineer before going to the ward; it was cold weather. Then I suggested, “Ruth, let’s pull that steam register away from the wall and twist off the pipe.” And so I sat down on the floor and we tugged away. We broke the register off the pipe.

I looked around the room and said, “There’s nothing more we can do here. Let’s go to another room.”

And Ruth said, “Are you sure you ought to do this, Dr. Erickson?”

I said, “Sure, it’s fun, isn’t it? I think it is.”

As we walked down the corridor to another room there was a nurse standing in the corridor. As we came abreast of her, I stepped over and ripped her uniform and her slip off so she stood in her panties and bra.

And Ruth said, “Dr. Erickson, you shouldn’t do a thing like that.” She rushed into the room and got the torn bedsheets, and wrapped them around the nurse.

She was a good girl after that. I really showed her what her behavior was like. Of course the nurse was an experienced nurse, and she enjoyed the episode as much as I did. All the nurses were horrified. All the rest of the staff was horrified at my behavior. Only the superintendent and I agreed that my behavior was right.

Ruth got even with me by escaping from the hospital, getting pregnant, delivering the child, putting it up for adoption. Then she voluntarily came back to the hospital and was a very good patient. A couple of years later she asked to be discharged, went to work as a waitress, met a young man, married him, became pregnant. To my knowledge, that marriage was happy long enough for two children to be born. Ruth was a good mother and a good citizen.

Often a patient can be shocked out of wrong behavior. That’s true for the neurotics and for the psychotics.
