title: SALAAM
---




The first year I was on the faculty at Wayne State Medical School, two particular things happened. In my class there was a girl who had been late to every class in high school. She was called up by teachers, and always promised prettily that she would be on time next time. And she apologized so sincerely. She was late to every class in high school and she was a straight-A student. She was always so apologetic, so full of believable promises.

She was late for every class in college, bawled out by every instructor and every professor. She always apologized prettily and sincerely and always promised to do better in the future—and kept on being late. She was a straight-A student in college.

Then she went to medical school and she was late to every class, to every lecture, to every laboratory. So her fellow students cussed her out for being late, for holding them up in laboratory work. And she went her merry way, apologizing and promising.

Now, someone on the faculty of the medical school who knew me said when they found out I was appointed to the faculty, “Wait till she hits Erickson’s class! There will be a terrific explosion! It will be heard the world around!”

On my first day I arrived at seven-thirty for my eight o’clock lecture and all the class was waiting, including Anne, the tardy one.

So at eight we all filed into the auditorium, except Anne. Each side of the auditorium had an aisle. There was an aisle at the back of the room, there was an aisle on the west side. The students were not listening to my lecture. They were looking at the door. I lectured, undisturbed, and when the door opened, very gently and softly and slowly, in walked Anne, twenty minutes late. All the students made a quick jerk with their heads and looked at me. They saw me gesture for them to stand and they all understood my language.

I salaamed to Anne as she walked from the door across the front of the room, down across the back of the room, halfway up the other side, and then took her seat, a seat on the middle aisle. And all the class silently salaamed her all the way. At the end of the class, there was a wild rush to get outside. Anne and I were the last to leave the auditorium. I was talking about Detroit weather, or some subject like that, and as we walked down the corridor, a janitor silently salaamed her; some undergraduate students came down the corridor and silently salaamed her; the dean stepped out of his office and salaamed her. His secretary came out and salaamed her; all day long poor Anne got salaamed silently. She was the first student in the class next day—and thereafter. She had withstood deans’ rebukes, rebukes from all the professors, but silent salaaming she could not take.




Whereas other teachers had tried to change Anne’s behavior by disciplining her, Erickson’s approach was to congratulate her on her power. Salaaming was a way of showing obeisance. He made it clear to her that she was using her power in a reverse way. When she could understand this, she could determine how she was going to use her power constructively.

Other people had tried to control her by verbal means and she proved that she could not be verbally controlled. Erickson used a nonverbal approach, which led her to realize that she was using her control in a self-hurting way. She could direct her controlling tendencies in more constructive ways. As in all cases, the power to change resided in her. Erickson set up a situation in which the change could happen.

Erickson’s attitude indicated his belief that he could deal incisively with whatever situation arose. If the situation called for confrontation, he knew that he could do that. If it called for kindness, he could be kind. If it called for sharpness, he knew he could be sharp. The subliminal message Erickson is giving us is that he had confidence in his ability to handle situations. We are free to identify with this feeling ourselves and to be more assertive.
