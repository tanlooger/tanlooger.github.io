title: DERAIL THEM
---




I got a letter yesterday from a former student. He said, “I had a rather paranoid patient in the room. All he wanted to talk about was his ideas. I tried to get his attention, but couldn’t. Then I thought about the unexpected, so I said, “No, I don’t like eating liver either.” The patient paused, shook his head, and said, “Usually, I like chicken.” And then the patient began talking about his real problems. The unexpected can always derail a train of thought, a trend of behavior, and you ought to use it.

I know that in college and in medical school, when I was an intern, whenever a professor wanted to reprimand me, I always came up with an idiotic irrelevant question or statement—and derailed them. In the summer time a professor began: “Erickson, I don’t like…”

“I don’t like the snow either,” I said.

Then he would say, “What are you talking about?”

I said, “The snow.”

“What snow?”

“The marvelous wonder—that no two snowflakes are the same.”

I think therapists ought to have ready, at any time, some irrelevant remarks. Then when patients sit down, saying a whole chapter that is irrelevant, get them off that conversational track. Derail them by some irrelevant remark. For example, “I know what you are thinking. I like trains too.”




Erickson always made certain that he, not the patient, controlled the therapeutic sessions. Karen Horney once said, “Patients enter therapy, not to cure their neuroses, but to perfect them.” If patients are to determine what happens in a therapeutic session, almost all of them will unconsciously do whatever is necessary to prevent real therapeutic change. Therefore, when the patient is on a useless track, it is important that the therapist derail him and direct him to a more fruitful one.
