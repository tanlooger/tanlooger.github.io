title: WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I SLAMMED YOU?
---




When my daughter Betty Alice was signing a school contract, the members of the school board were holding their breath. Their sighs were released when she finished her signature. Betty Alice wondered what that meant. She knew it wouldn’t take long to find out. She did find out very promptly. The class that she taught was composed of fifteen-year-old delinquents, waiting for their sixteenth birthday so they could quit school, and they all had long lists of arrests. They were really delinquents. One of them had been arrested at least thirty times and he had twice beaten up a policeman. And he was six feet two inches tall and weighed 220 pounds. The previous semester he had approached the teacher and said, “Miss Johnson, what would you do if I slammed you?” Apparently the teacher gave him the wrong answer because he slammed her across the room and put her in the hospital. Betty Alice thought to herself, “I wonder when that poor kid will tangle with me. I am five foot two and weigh 102 pounds.” She didn’t have to wait long.

She was riding her bike in the park when she saw him. “Here was this great big giant with a nasty smile on his face, so I put a wondering look on my face and opened my big blue eyes widely. He stopped in front of me, and asked, ‘What would you do if I slammed you?’”

The poor kid. She took two quick steps toward him and snarled, “So help me God, I’d kill you!” He’d asked a simple question; she’d given a simple reply, “So help me God, I’d kill you, so get on over to that seat quick!”

He had never heard such a loud snarl from such a little kitten. As he was sitting down, there was this wondering look on his face. She had put him down and he knew he wouldn’t dare let any other kid harass her. He was her constant protector. It was so beautiful. She was very beautiful. The unexpected always helps. You never do what’s expected.
