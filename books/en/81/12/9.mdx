title: LANCE AND COOKIE
---




The Erickson family is very fond of practical jokes that do not hurt. They are remembered long and happily.

At a student dance at Ann Arbor, my son Lance saw a girl who looked attractive to him, so he cut in on her and asked her for a date. She told him firmly and gently, “The answer is no; I’m going steady.”

Lance said, “Oh, I don’t mind that a bit.”

“The answer is no.”

A month later he saw the same girl, cut in on her at a dance, and asked for a date. The girl said, “You asked me that once before. The answer was no then and it still is no.”

Lance said, “That means we’ll have to discuss it over a table at Oscar’s Restaurant.”

She looked at him as if she thought he was out of his mind.

But Lance did thorough research. One Saturday afternoon he and his best friend walked into the nursing students’ dormitory parlor, where this girl was entertaining her boyfriend. Lance walked up to the girl and said, “Cookie, I want you to meet my best friend, Dean.” “Dean, this is my cousin Cookie. Only I’m not really her cousin. I’m her illegitimate half-cousin. But we don’t make much mention of that outside the family.” Then he asked, “How’s Uncle George’s broken leg?”

The girl knew she had an Uncle George in northern Michigan with a broken leg.

Then he added, “How many quarts of strawberries did Aunt Nellie can last summer?” And the girl knew she had an Aunt Nellie whose hobby was canning strawberries. Then he asked, “How is Vicki getting along with her algebra in high school?” And Cookie knew all about Vicki’s troubles in high school.

Then Lance happened to notice the boyfriend with his mouth open, eyes popping. He said, “Do you know Cookie? My name is Lance. I’m Cookie’s cousin, only I’m not really her cousin. I’m her illegitimate half-cousin. We don’t make much mention of that outside the family.” Then he turned to Dean and said, “Dean, why don’t you take him out to dinner?”

And Dean walked over, put his arm around the young man. And Lance turned to Cookie and said, “We’ve got a lot of family news to exchange.”

In all the years that we’ve known Cookie she has never raised her voice: she’s calm and gentle and firm. And Cookie said, “There are a lot of things I want to say to you.” But she didn’t notice that they had walked into that restaurant.

When they got engaged, Cookie wanted a picture of him, so he gave her one. I had taken that picture myself, when he was a little kid, in the nude.

And one day he said, “Cookie, I really ought to meet your parents.”

And Cookie said, “Oh, oh, oh, oh. I suppose you’ll have to.”

One afternoon at four o’clock, a well-dressed young man carrying a briefcase walked into the Cooks’ backyard and said, “Mr. Cook, I want to discuss insurance with you.” Lance has a gift of gab. He can discuss lightning insurance, tornado insurance, life insurance, accident insurance, car insurance. At quarter to five Mrs. Cook came out on the back porch and called to her husband, “Supper.”

Lance turned to Mr. Cook and in a small voice said, “You know it’s a long time since I had a home-cooked meal. I’m certain your wife wouldn’t mind setting an extra plate for me. It really would be delightful to have a home-cooked meal.”

They got into the house, and Lance said, “Mrs. Cook, it’s been a long time since I had a home-cooked meal. Your husband assured me it would be no trouble at all to set an extra plate. I’m willing to take pot luck.”

Right through the meal, Lance discussed everything. He complimented every dish and Mrs. Cook looked daggers at Mr. Cook. At the end of the meal, Lance expressed his gratitude and then he said, “I have one more insurance policy, and this one is one I know you’ll want to buy. It’s an insurance policy against an undesirable son-in-law!”




Lance and Cookie both remembered this incident when I asked them about it, in 1980. Lance recalled that after he had delivered his punch line, Mr. Cook turned to Cookie with a smile and said, “Why, you little shit!”

Just as Lance was confident that he could induce Cookie to date him and to marry him, Erickson was supremely confident that patients would do what he asked. He was also confident that his therapy would succeed. This confidence was not based on wishful thinking, but on years of experience, careful observation, and painstaking preparation.

The case histories that follow demonstrate some of the results of this planning, which was at least as thorough as the planning for one of his practical jokes.
