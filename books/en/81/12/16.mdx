title: GROWTH

My son Lance came into the office and said, “Will I always be a string-bean Maypole?” He was very slender, very tall, very thin.

I said, “Your destiny as a teenager is to be a string-bean Maypole. And you can look forward to the day when you walk into the office, hand me your jacket, and say, ‘Get lost, Dad.’”

And one day he walked into the office, a grin on his face, handed me his jacket, and said, “Get lost, Dad.” I put on his jacket; the sleeves were too long. They covered my hands and the shoulders were too wide.




Erickson is using an attribute that appears negative and is pointing out its positive aspect. In every negative, he can find a positive. Any good therapist does this. Erickson just does it better than most. So Erickson reframes being a string bean into being taller than Dad and knows that this will evoke a good feeling. Lance can look forward to being taller than Dad, to a time when Dad will get lost in Lance’s jacket.

Jeffrey Zeig pointed out to me that Erickson always had a goal. Zeig said, “I went over to him one day, and out of the blue I said to him, ‘What’s your goal?’ Without hesitation Erickson said, ‘To see Roxanna’s [his daughter] baby.’ He knew exactly what I was saying. He did not bat an eyelash. I knew that he would name something in the future.” Zeig went on, “He had this positive orientation to the future. It was not an obsession, it was like a light that draws a moth to it. He did not become obsessed with it, but it was out there and it pulled him along.”
