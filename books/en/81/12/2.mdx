title: BERT AND COCOA
---




This was when Bert was transferred to Camp Pendleton, California, where Betty had some relatives. We thought he might look up some of them sometime. And one morning, at 3 A.M., Bert, in his fatigues, knocked on the door of a house by the roadside. The man of the house came to the door and saw the young marine, who said, “I beg your pardon, sir. I have a message for your wife, sir. Will you call your wife to the door, please, sir?”

He said, “Can’t you give me the message?”

Bert said, “The message, sir, is for your wife, sir. Will you please call her to the door so I can give it to her, sir?”

Bert got into the kitchen, and said to the man’s wife, “Ma’am, I was walking down the highway returning to Camp Pendleton and got to thinking about my mom. That made me homesick for my Mom and for the kind of cocoa my mom makes. And I know it would please my mom if I gave somebody her recipe. I’ll make cocoa the way my mom does.”

That man kept thinking, “Shall I call the police, men in white, shore patrol?”

Bert made the cocoa, talking about generalities. When the cocoa was nearly ready, he said, “Do you have children, ma’am?”

She said, “Yes, three girls.”

“How old are they, ma’am? Oh, young. Cocoa is good for growing children. Would you call them into the kitchen so they can drink some of this cocoa like my mom makes?”

So she went and called three little girls and Bert clowned around a bit for the little girls, stirring the cocoa with a spoon held over his back. Anything to please the kids. And when the cocoa was poured, Bert took a sip, sighed deeply and said, “Yes siree sir, its just like the cocoa my mom makes. I get so homesick for my mom.”

“Where does your mother live?”

“She lives in Detroit. I get so homesick for my mom and her cocoa.”

“What is your mother’s name?”

“It’s Elizabeth.”

“I meant her last name.”

“Why ma’am, she has a middle name in front of her last name.”

“What is your mother’s middle name?”

“Euphemia.”

And the woman said, “Elizabeth Euphemia? Egad, what is your name?”

“It’s Erickson, cousin Anita.”

About a year later we happened to visit our cousin Anita in California, and they told us about that.
