title: US CRIPPLES
---




At the end of three weeks of classes the medical students knew my tendency to use humor. So I told them, “Next Monday morning, Jerry, you go to the fourth floor and keep the elevator doors open. Tommy, you stand on the stairwell and look down to the ground floor. When you see me walking up the steps, signal Jerry to release the elevator doors, and Sam, you be on the ground floor pressing the elevator button. In the meantime, spread the rumor that on next Monday morning Dr. Erickson is going to pull one of his gags on the class.”

They did good work spreading the rumor. Next Monday all the class was there, including a boy with a prosthesis. That student had been very sociable, outgoing, friendly with everybody, during his freshman year. In his sophomore year everybody liked him and he liked everybody; he was always socializing. He was a good student, well respected, well liked by everybody. In his sophomore year he lost a leg in an automobile accident through no fault of his. When he was fitted with an artificial leg, he became very withdrawn, oversensitive. The dean had warned me about that boy being withdrawn and oversensitive, but still a good student, how he had dropped all his old friendliness, never returned a greeting, never greeted anybody, just kept his nose in his books and minded his own business.

I told the dean to give me a few weeks to let the class get acquainted with me and then I’d take care of that chap. On that Monday, with Jerry holding the elevator doors open and Tommy stationed at the head of the stairwell, I found the class all on the ground floor waiting for me at seven-thirty. I engaged in social chitchat about the weather and what was going on in Detroit and then I said, “What’s the matter with your thumb, Sam? Is it weak? Push that elevator button.”

He said, “I have been.”

I said, “Maybe your thumb is so weak, you ought to use two thumbs.”

He said, “I tried that too, but that damn janitor is so worried about getting his pail and mops down, he’s probably holding the elevator doors open.”

I talked a while and then told Sam, “Push that elevator again.”

Sam obliged. No sound of the elevator coming. Finally, at five minutes of eight I turned to the student with the artificial leg and said, “Let’s us cripples hobble upstairs and leave the elevator for the able-bodied.”

“Us cripples” started hobbling upstairs. Tommy signaled to Jerry; Sam pushed the button. The able-bodied waited for the elevator. Us cripples hobbled upstairs. At the end of the hour, that student was socializing again—with a new identity. He belonged to the professorial group: “Us cripples.” I was a professor; I had a bad leg; he identified with me; I identified with him. So with that new status he regained all his outgoing ways. He was socializing at the end of the hour.




Often, simply by the changing of a frame of reference, something can be accomplished. The elaborate planning here, with the use of accomplices, is similar to the preparation a magician puts into his performance. It is also similar to the preparation leading up to a practical joke.
