title: GETTING JEFF TO CALL
---




My daughter Kristi went to a basketball game at North High when she was fifteen. She was a student in West High and she went to North High with a companion, Margie, a girl she had met in kindergarten. When she came home, she said to me, “Guess who I saw at the game tonight? You remember the little kid up the street who moved away and we often wondered what happened to him? He’s a senior in North High. He has three athletic letters, and good grades. And now my only problem is to get him to date me, and let him think the whole idea is his own.”

I remembered that kid very well. Three basketball games later, Kristi came into the bedroom and said, “Jeff doesn’t know it, but he’s going to call me tomorrow afternoon for a date.”

I was alert to the telephone and so was she. On Saturday afternoon, the phone rang and Jeff asked her for a date. I waited patiently to find out how she’d managed that. You don’t rush things. So, after waiting for a while, I said, “How did you maneuver that?”

She said, “Margie was too shy to introduce me, so at the next basketball game, I looked him up and said, ‘I’ll bet you don’t know me,’ and he looked me up and down and said, ‘That’s right, I don’t.’ So I told him, ‘I’m one of the Erickson girls—which one?’”

He looked her over and said, “Kristi.”

She said, “That’s right. It’s nice seeing you again after all these years.” And then she said, “I have to go and find Margie,” and walked off—the old trick of letting the audience cry for more. She walked off before he had the chance to ask any questions. He was asking for more, but she was gone.

At the next meeting she saw him in a crowd, talking earnestly to another boy. She sneaked up, close enough to get the trend of the conversation, and then she evaporated, and when Jeff wandered off she walked over to that boy and started the same conversation. No introductions. They just discussed that problem, whatever it was.

At the third basketball game, Kristi hunted up that student and listened to the conversation, and Jeff came around and the other boy said, “Hi, Jeff, let me introduce you to—oh, my, we haven’t been introduced yet.” “Guess you’ll have to do it,” she told Jeff.

That’s when my daughter said, “Jeff is calling tomorrow for a date.”




Kristi cleverly gives Jeff enough information and enough contact with her to arouse his interest, but not to satisfy it. He is left wanting more. She has him introduce her to one of his friends, someone he respects, who obviously is interested in her. He is, of necessity, brought back to recall his warm associations with her during childhood and, at the same time, to see her in a different light—that is, as someone who is a peer and is attractive to a young man. This also arouses his jealousy and competitive instincts. Therefore, Kristi is quite certain that he will soon call.

Why did Erickson include sentences such as “They just discussed that problem”? This does not fit into a conversation between two adolescents. Was he leaving room for a patient or reader to put his own “problem” into the tale?
