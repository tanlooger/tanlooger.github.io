title: MANIPULATION
---




I’ve been accused of manipulating patients—to which I reply: Every mother manipulates her baby—if she wants it to live. And every time you go to the store you manipulate the clerk to do your bidding. And when you go to a restaurant, you manipulate the waiter. And the teacher in school manipulates you into learning to read and write. In fact, life is one big manipulation. The final manipulation is putting you to rest. And that’s manipulation, too.

They have to lower the coffin and then they have to get the ropes out—all manipulation.

And you manipulate a pencil—to write, to record thoughts. And you manipulate yourself, carrying around Planters peanuts, or cigarettes, or Life Savers. One of my daughters called them “mint-pepper saferlifes.” She also says “flutterbys” and “melon-waters.” And now she’s pregnant and living in Dallas.

I wrote a letter to her, saying that naming the baby would be easy. All she has to do, if it is a boy, is to name it “Dallas.” If it is a girl she could name it “Alice.” Her husband says that in Texas you have to have double names. He wants to name it “Billy-Rubin.” You know what bilirubin is? A bile secretion! Of course, he could call it “Hemo Globin.”




Erickson stressed that, in all situations, you must manipulate. Paul Watzlawick pointed out, in The Language of Change, “One cannot not influence.” Every communication must evoke responses and is, therefore, a manipulation. So, you might as well manipulate effectively, relevantly, and constructively. In this brief story, Erickson gives examples of manipulation from birth to death. He comes full-circle with another birth, and the cycle continues. He is telling his daughter Roxy, who used to play with words, that she can still playfully manipulate words in naming her child. He is also telling her, and us, that we should not lose the playfulness and spontaneity of childhood.

Erickson instructed therapists in ways of setting up stories. He said, “One thing I teach my students is this: Take a new book by an author who you know is good. Read the last chapter first. Speculate about the contents of the preceding chapter. Speculate in all possible directions. You will be wrong in a lot of your speculations. Read that chapter and then speculate on the previous chapter. You read a good book from the last chapter to the first, speculating all the way.”

Erickson stated that this was not only a good way to learn to set up a story, but it was also an effective way of learning how to speculate freely—in all directions. “And you break your pattern of rigid thinking. It is extremely useful.”

Through his tales he is suggesting that we, the readers, can determine our goals and then devise strategies to achieve these goals. The next stories, about his son Bert, are good illustrations of the Ericksons’ love of practical jokes. Through their humorous element and from the relish with which Erickson told them, these stories model an optimistic and humorous view of life.
