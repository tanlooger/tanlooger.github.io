title: LEARNING TO STAND UP
---




We learn so much at a conscious level and then we forget what we learn and use the skill. You see, I had a terrific advantage over others. I had polio, and I was totally paralyzed, and the inflammation was so great that I had a sensory paralysis too. I could move my eyes and my hearing was undisturbed. I got very lonesome lying in bed, unable to move anything except my eyeballs. I was quarantined on the farm with seven sisters, one brother, two parents, and a practical nurse. And how could I entertain myself? I started watching people and my environment. I soon learned that my sisters could say “no” when they meant “yes.” And they could say “yes” and mean “no” at the same time. They could offer another sister an apple and hold it back. And I began studying nonverbal language and body language.

I had a baby sister who had begun to learn to creep. I would have to learn to stand up and walk. And you can imagine the intensity with which I watched as my baby sister grew from creeping to learning how to stand up. And you don’t know how you learned how to stand up. You don’t even know how you walked. You can think that you can walk in a straight line six blocks—with no pedestrian or vehicular traffic. You don’t know that you couldn’t walk in a straight line at a steady pace!

You don’t know what you do when you walk. You don’t know how you learned to stand up. You learned by reaching up your hand and pulling yourself up. That put pressure on your hands—and, by accident, you discovered that you could put weight on your feet. That’s an awfully complicated thing because your knees would give way—and, when your knees would keep straight, your hips would give way. Then you got your feet crossed. And you couldn’t stand up because both your knees and your hips would give way. Your feet were crossed—and you soon learned to get a wide brace—and you pull yourself up and you have the job of learning how to keep your knees straight—one at a time and as soon as you learn that, you have to learn how to give your attention to keep your hips straight. Then you found out that you had to learn to give your attention to keep your hips straight and knees straight at the same time and feet far apart! Now finally you could stand having your feet far apart, resting on your hands.

Then came the lesson in three stages. You distribute your weight on your one hand and your two feet, this hand not supporting you at all [E. raises his left hand]. Honestly hard work—allowing you to learn to stand up straight, your hips straight, knees straight, feet far apart, this hand [right hand] pressing down hard. Then you discover how to alter your body balance. You alter your body balance by turning your head, turning your body. You have to learn to coordinate all alterations of your body balance when you move your hand, your head, your shoulder, your body—and then you have to learn it all over again with the other hand. Then comes the terribly hard job of learning to have both hands up and moving your hands in all directions and to depend upon the two solid bases of your feet, far apart. And keeping your hips straight—your knees straight and keeping your mind’s attention so divided that you can attend to your knees, your hips, your left arm, your right arm, your head, your body. And finally, when you had enough skill, you tried balancing on one foot. That was a hell of a job!

How do you hold your entire body keeping your hips straight, your knees straight and feeling hand movement, head movement, body movement? And then you put your one foot ahead and alter your body’s center of gravity! Your knees bent—and you sat down! You got up again and tried it again. Finally you learned how to move one foot ahead and took a step and it seemed to be good. So you repeated it—it seemed so good. Then the third step—with the same foot—and you toppled! It took you a long time to alternate right left, right left, right left. Now you could swing your arms, turn your head, look right and left, and walk along, never paying a bit of attention to keeping your knees straight, hips straight.




Erickson is suggesting that a disability may give one an advantage, a “terrific advantage over others.” He suggests that learning is one of the best forms of entertainment. When he is completely paralyzed he asks, “How can I entertain myself?” He follows that by describing how he developed his powers of observation. Then he tells about the pleasure of further learning—learning the things that are ordinarily unconscious—and gives the example of our unconscious actions and movements as we walk down the street.

When he talks about the actual process of learning to stand up, there is much emphasis on kinesthetic awareness, and the listener is likely to focus on his own inner kinesthetic sense. The clumsiness of trying to stand, accompanied by having feet crossed and so on, is like the clumsiness we all experience in trying to learn something new.

By describing plausible experiences that an infant might have in learning to stand and walk, he encourages regression of the listener to the infant level. In fact, nearly everyone, on listening to this story, will go into a hypnotic trance, with regression. The emphasis in the story is on learning a basic skill, consciously at first, and having it become unconscious. When the story is used as a hypnotic induction, it encourages regression and the manifestation of automatisms. It is interesting to note that Erickson’s negative statements (i.e., “you toppled”) are in the past tense. He changes to the present tense to imbed positive suggestions (“you alter your body balance”).

This “very early learning set” story is helpful at the beginning of any therapeutic program because it brings the patient back to a time before the onset of his neurotic problems, disrupting, at least temporarily, his fixed mental sets. It also reminds the patient that learning is or was difficult but that he will learn, if he persists. After all, he knows that he can now walk, without effort.

Erickson is also pointing out that we have laid down the basic building blocks and we will carry these basic building blocks with us into the future. As a farm boy, Erickson was always concerned with planting for a harvest that would be reaped in the future. In this story, Erickson is laying down one of the building blocks for therapy, by talking about how people learn. He is making the learning process nonthreatening and interesting. He is also starting to illustrate some of the points that he will make over and over again with other stories, that is, he watched things very closely. He learned by watching others. He is cueing in the message “You are here to learn,” and he is stimulating a “learning set”—an openness to learning. Paralysis is disabling, and a patient is involved with things that are disabling. Erickson turns this paralysis into something useful. He was alone and could rely on nobody but himself, and he started watching.

When he says that his sister could offer another sister an apple and hold it back, is he saying that he can offer an apple—learning—and hold it back? Or that you, yourself, can offer something of yourself and still be holding some of it back? He is not offering one or another message, but actually a multileveled message. And the apple brings to mind the Garden of Eden—the beginning, the genesis.

“And you can imagine the intensity with which I watched.” Here he is marking the word “imagine.” Of course, this is the way his hypnotic work will be done, with imagery, with imagining. He is also starting the induction and focusing the listener’s attention.

Jeff Zeig’s comment on this story was, “Erickson had the ability to play with your attention and to play with his own attention. He chuckled his way through all of his stories. He was going to have fun, and he was inviting you to play. If you did not want to play, that was your problem. He would still make invitations, but he was not going to be offended if you rejected them. We still have scratched only the surface. I feel that I have a pretty good understanding of Erickson’s process, yet, if we sat down with him to discuss what he was doing, we would discover we had hit only the surface level, or perhaps one layer below the surface. He would have in mind two more layers below the surface. He could see those two or three layers when he presented the symbol of an apple. It would be ‘What does a little child think of an apple?’ or ‘What do you do with an apple as a little child?’ You bring an apple to the teacher. And it was a symbol of being pleasing. Erickson had an understanding of people’s unconscious, so that he would know that if you presented this type of word or symbol, you could expect these possible associations. As you watched the person, you could then grab on to whichever associations that particular person had, and you could follow up on them. This kind of depth is really unmatched. So you don’t know how you learned to stand up. But you have that information.”

This was one of Erickson’s important principles—that people have, in their own natural history, the resources to overcome the problem for which they are seeking help. In this story, he reminds people that they have resources of which they are not yet aware.

When he uses phrases such as “You put pressure on your hand—and by accident you discovered that you could put weight on your feet,” this was his way of conveying his idea of using “programmed accidents” in therapy. You put the patient into a situation and he is bound to discover things—if he is aware at all.

“It is an awfully complicated thing because your knees would give way and when your knees would keep straight, your hips would give way.” He is cueing the unconscious with words such as “straight” and “stand up.” Later, when these words or phrases are introduced into therapy, the entire learning set and attitude toward learning are then automatically evoked.
