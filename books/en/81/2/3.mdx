title: DILATATION
---




Erickson never made miraculous claims for hypnosis. Still, he noted repeatedly that we all possess powers, natural powers, that we do not utilize. With appropriate motivating suggestions and direction, these powers can often be harnessed and used. When he told the following story, in response to the question “Is hypnosis helpful in the treatment of cancer?” he was referring mainly to its value in the alleviation of pain. There was some implication that along with such conventional treatments as surgery, hypnosis might improve the patient’s chances of survival.




I think a great deal can be done. The president of the state medical society, a surgeon, sent me a woman. He had operated on her for cancer of the uterus and then operated on her for cancer of the colon, of a different variety.

She developed a contraction of the lower colon. Defecation was extremely painful, and she went to his office for slow, gradual dilatation. And she suffered from such terrible pain. He asked me, “Can you help the woman with hypnosis? I don’t want to do a third operation on that woman.”

So I used a trance. I told the woman that she had had two cancers of different kinds; now she suffered from a painful contraction of the lower colon. And that’s very painful and had to be dilated. I told her that if, every day, she would get into her swimming suit, throw an automobile tire into the swimming pool, sit in there, and enjoy the comfort of the swimming pool and the water, the dilatation would be much less painful.

And she did that every day. The doctor said the dilatation proceeded much more rapidly, unusually rapidly. He said the woman complained about pain as before, but the tone of her voice was different. He didn’t think she had the same degree of pain.

About a year later the woman came by and hugged and kissed me and told me how wonderful life was. Her colon had healed; the doctor said she had a normal colon. He had removed the cancer from it. No recurrence.




Erickson is suggesting that “dilatation” will be much less painful if a person takes some action—getting a tire tube and then sitting in the swimming pool, in comfort. He is setting the mood for the therapy that will follow, suggesting that it could be done in relative comfort. He is also suggesting that it will “proceed much more rapidly, unusually rapidly.” The final implication is that the therapy will be successful, as it was with this woman, in spite of the fact that she was suffering from a condition that is often fatal. Since instructions, in this case, a rather homey remedy for pain, are given in hypnosis, they would have more power than if they were given in the waking state.

Erickson might tell this type of story to convey a message to someone in the group who he felt was emotionally or mentally “constipated.” He might indicate that the message was intended for that particular person by looking in one direction and directing his voice in another, or by changing the tone of his voice when he was facing that particular person, or by avoiding looking at that particular person.
