title: QUARRELING
---




A man from Philadelphia, whose headaches I cured, sent his aunt and uncle out to see me. He said, “Those two have quarreled every day of their married life. They’ve been married over thirty years.”

They came out to see me. I said, “Haven’t you had enough of quarreling? Why not start enjoying life?” And they had a very pleasant life. And the man’s aunt tried to persuade her sister to come out, because his mother was very unhappy.




In this story, Erickson, in the indirect manner that is typical of him, is answering critics who ask about follow-up on his patients. He makes it clear that the headache cure was effective by telling us that “the man from Philadelphia” sent his aunt and uncle to see him. It is also obvious that their situation was improved since the aunt felt Erickson could help her sister. Erickson often begins a case report with reference to a previous patient who was treated successfully.

This story might be told by Erickson when someone in the group was arguing inwardly with him or with himself. He marks the phrase “Haven’t you had enough of quarreling?”

The story may be difficult to believe. I present it, however, because its simplicity is so appealing.

I asked Erickson to tell us more about the context in which these simple suggestions had been given. How much time had he spent in establishing rapport? Did he hypnotize the couple?

He said, “I just used a waking trance which developed into a light trance. I asked them, ‘But why not enjoy life? you’ve had over thirty years of quarreling. I think marriage should be enjoyable. And you haven’t too many years left to enjoy marriage.’ And they were appreciative.

“Too many therapists think that they must direct the change and help the patient to change. Therapy is like starting a snowball rolling at the top of a mountain. As it rolls down, it grows larger and larger and becomes an avalanche that fits the shape of the mountain.”
