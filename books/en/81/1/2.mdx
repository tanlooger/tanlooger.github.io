title: INTERPRETATIONS OF ERICKSON’S THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES
---




Erickson’s case reports often appear to present magical cures, and some people have reacted by not believing them. Others feel that they are fictional reports—interestingly written and presented, but fiction nevertheless. From personal observation of Erickson while he was working with patients, I can attest that at least some of the reports are not fiction. In fact, I believe that all of them are quite factual and were edited only for the sake of a more readable, and perhaps more dramatic, presentation than is found in most clinical reports. Some who believe that Erickson effected dramatic and real changes in patients, students, and therapists still maintain that these results were probably obtained because of some special Ericksonian charisma that could not be transmitted to other therapists. Recently, however, there have been attempts to study his modes of communication in a more analytical way.

In Uncommon Therapy, Jay Haley emphasizes the strategic aspect. Haley has defined “strategic therapy” as one in which “the clinician initiates what happens during therapy and designs a particular approach for each problem.” Haley points out that Erickson communicates with patients, not only in metaphors, but that he also “works within the metaphor to bring about a change.” He notes that Erickson avoids interpretations and that he would feel that “typical ‘insight’ interpretations of unconscious communications are absurdly reductionistic, like summarizing a Shakespearean play in a sentence.” Haley has also pointed out that major features of Ericksonian therapy include “encouraging resistance,” “providing a worse alternative,” “encouraging a response by frustrating it,” “seeding ideas,” “amplifying a deviation,” and “prescribing the symptom.”

Bandler and Grinder, with their “neurolinguistic” approach, have interpreted Erickson’s communication in a microscopic way. They have noted, for example, his tendency to “mark” suggestions, which he may intersperse within a story. This “marking” is done, for example, by pausing, by changing his position or tone of voice. It may also be accomplished by preceding the “marked” suggestion with the insertion of the patient’s name.

Ernest Rossi, in Hypnotic Realities and Hypnotherapy, has broken down Erickson’s hypnotic inductions and indirect forms of suggestion into five stages: (1) fixation of attention, (2) depotentiating habitual frameworks and belief systems, (3) unconscious search, (4) unconscious process, and (5) hypnotic response. Each stage leads to the next. Rossi and his co-author, Erickson himself, have designated their approach as the “Utilization Approach to Hypnotherapy.” In these books and in Watzlawick’s works The Language of Change and Change, there is discussion of the thesis that Erickson communicates with the right brain, with its tendency to deal primarily in terms of primary processes, archaic language, emotions, space, and form (i.e., images).

Jeffrey Zeig, in A Teaching Seminar with Milton H. Erickson, lists some of the values of using anecdotes in therapy as follows: (i) anecdotes are nonthreatening; (2) anecdotes are engaging; (3) anecdotes foster independence: the individual needs to make sense out of the message and then come to a self-initiated conclusion or a self-initiated action; (4) anecdotes can be used to bypass natural resistance to change; (5) anecdotes can be used to control the relationship; (6) anecdotes model flexibility; (7) anecdotes can create confusion and promote hypnotic responsiveness; and (8) anecdotes tag the memory—” they make the presented idea more memorable.”
