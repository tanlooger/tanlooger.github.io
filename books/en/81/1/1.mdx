title: INTRAPSYCHIC CHANGE
---




As already mentioned, the unconscious mind can be influenced by positive input. Involvement with a therapist like Erickson, who is optimistic and supportive of growth, can in itself constitute positive input. The addition of “teaching tales” reinforces, supplements, and directs that positive input. In the telling of stories, Erickson adds new data, evokes new feelings, and prescribes new experiences. A patient who has been struggling for years within a guilt-ridden, narrow view of life may be presented through these tales with Erickson’s permissive, life-celebrating philosophy. These views reach him on many levels, including the unconscious. They may be presented to the patient in the waking state and the hypnotic state. The patient may then discover that he does not have to rely solely on his own well-established circular patterns of thought. He does not have to “make do” with his own limited philosophy and limited mental sets. Partly through the medium of these stories, he becomes aware of new possibilities, which he is free to accept or reject on both conscious and unconscious levels.

Sometimes the patient will identify with a character in a story, or with Erickson himself—the master, who can deal successfully with difficult challenges. He may then experience a sense of accomplishment. This sense of accomplishment allows him to approach a situation with a greater feeling of confidence. This can be illustrated in the treatment of sexual problems, such as premature ejaculation. When a patient has been able to experience himself successfully enjoying a sexual act while in a hypnotic trance, the therapist has added to his memories the feeling of success and the expectation of further success.

Of course, not all of Erickson’s teaching tales, and certainly not all parts of all tales, are aimed at adding such positive input to the unconscious. Some of them are meant to stir up and bring to awareness feelings of deadness, feelings of being stuck, or feelings of lack of authenticity. The listener then must tap his own unconscious resources in order to ameliorate the situation. Or he may find emotional and intellectual sustenance in one of the other Erickson tales.

A single remembered phrase from one of Erickson’s stories may change the feeling of an entire day. On one occasion, this happened to me while I was walking beside a meadow. Suddenly the sentence “Did you know that every blade of grass is a different shade of green?” popped into my head and I looked at the grass more closely. Indeed, it was true! For the rest of the day, I walked around with my eyes more open than usual.

Many of Erickson’s tales appear to involve interactions and even manipulations between people. One might conclude that he is teaching people how to manipulate others. This is far from the intent of the stories, or their effect, which is manifested mostly in inner changes. Many people who have heard these stories find themselves functioning with increased freedom and creativity. This obviously comes from some intrapsychic changes. We can better understand these changes if we look at the stories and their characters as representing inner psychic structures. For example, parents in the stories can represent guides, sources of love and support, or sources of irrational guidance. More often they represent sources of irrational coercive force. A child in a story can represent the child within us—inexperienced, eager to learn but not knowing how, spontaneous but ignorant, with a limited repertoire of behaviors and responses. When the reader identifies with the child, he is likely to feel hopeful as he hears how the child overcomes blockages to growth and freedom.

Some intrapsychic changes may result from the process of “reparenting.” Erickson used this concept in a broader way than had Jacqui Lee Schiff in her book Transactional Analysis Treatment of Psychosis. Erickson applied the term to his method of replacing previous “parental” injunctions with new ideas, which he instilled by means of posthypnotic suggestions.

These posthypnotic suggestions might be facilitated by a phrase that Erickson often included in his hypnotic inductions: “And my voice will go with you wherever you are.” This phrase enabled him to keep contact with the patient in trance, regardless of the depth of the patient’s regression, while also serving as a cue to posthypnotic suggestions. Another cueing phrase might be “You will see a flash of color.” Subsequently, long after the therapeutic session, whenever the patient saw a flash of color, he was likely to respond to other posthypnotic suggestions given in conjunction with the “flash of color” suggestion. These suggestions could include injunctions and points of view, which would then be “heard” (often in Erickson’s voice) as the voice of an introjected parent or superego. This introjection of the therapist’s voice can occur in any psychotherapy but is most likely to occur when the patient is in a hypnotic trance. One possible explanation for this phenomenon was given by Lawrence Kubie at a meeting of the American Psychoanalytic Association. Dr. Kubie noted that in a hypnotic trance the distinction between hypnotist and subject is abolished. The subject then hears the hypnotist’s voice as if it were coming from inside his own head—as his own inner voice. This was true of Erickson. His voice would become your voice, and his voice would go with you, wherever you were.

Obviously, the best way of conveying the full impact of these tales would be to present them through videotape, or, at least, audiotape. One would certainly have a better sense of the importance of Erickson’s changes of voice, pauses, body position, and nonverbal cues. Unfortunately, rather few videotapes are available at this time. The intelligibility of most audiotapes is poor. In fact, one advantage of having the stories printed out is that they are more easily available for study and review.
