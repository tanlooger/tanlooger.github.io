title: VICIOUS PLEASURE
---




A woman in her thirties arrived and said, “I don’t suppose you want to see me.” I said, “That’s your supposition, would you like to hear mine?”

“Well,” she said, “I am not deserving of your attention. When I was six years old my father molested me sexually and from the age of six until seventeen he used me as a sexual object, regularly, several times a week. And every time he did it I was in a state of fear. I was frozen with terror. I felt dirty, inferior, inadequate, ashamed.

“I thought, at seventeen, I had enough strength to break away from him and I worked my way through the rest of high school, hoping that that would give me a feeling of self-respect, and it didn’t. Then I thought maybe a bachelor-of-arts degree would give me a feeling of self-respect. I worked my way through college. I felt ashamed, inferior, indecent. It was a terrible feeling of disappointment. I thought maybe a master’s degree would give me self-respect, but it didn’t. And all through college and graduate school I was propositioned. And that proved I didn’t deserve self-respect. And I thought I would enroll for a doctorate degree, and men kept propositioning me. I just gave up and became a common prostitute. But that’s not very nice. And some man offered to let me live with him. Well, a girl needs to have food and shelter so I agreed to it.

“Sex was a horrible experience. A penis is so hard and looks so threatening. I just became fear stricken and passive. And it was a painful, horrible experience. This man got tired of me and I began living with another man. The same thing over and over, and now I come to you. I feel like filth. An erect penis just terrifies me and I just get helpless, and weak, and passive. I am so glad when a man finishes.

“But I still have to live. I have to have clothes. I have to have shelter; and essentially I am not worth anything else.”

I said, “That’s an unhappy story; and the really unhappy part is—you’re stupid! You tell me that you are afraid of a bold, erect, hard penis—and that’s stupid! You know you have a vagina; I know it. A vagina can take the biggest, boldest, most assertive penis and turn it into a dangling, helpless object.

“And your vagina can take a vicious pleasure in reducing it to a helpless dangling object.”

The change on her face was wonderful. She said, “I am going to go back to Los Angeles, and can I see you in a month’s time?” And I said, “Certainly.” She came back in a month’s time and said, “You’re right! I went to bed with a man and I took a vicious pleasure in reducing him to helplessness. It didn’t take long, and I enjoyed it. And I tried another man. The same thing. And another man. And it’s pleasurable! Now I am going to get my Ph.D. and go into counseling, and I am going to wait until I see a man I want to live with.”

I called her stupid. I really got her attention. And then I said, “Vicious pleasure.” And she did resent men. I also said “pleasure.”




When Erickson told me this tale I commented, “The way you described that hard penis, you made it sound very attractive; also—intriguing. Because there was also some verbal seduction. You were penetrating her verbally and imaginatively.”

The first part of the tale, ending with “I am not worth anything else,” is a modeling of the patient’s world. If this tale is told to a patient who has tried unsuccessfully to overcome self-hate by means of external changes (getting college degrees, letting herself be used by others) and that patient is also threatened by some phobic stimulus (as represented by a “hard, threatening penis”), there is a good possibility, at least on an unconscious level, that there will be a recognition that the story parallels the patient’s world.

The second phase, “role-modeling the patient’s world,” is accomplished after Erickson has acquired the patient’s attention. Of course, if one were telling this story, attention would already have been won by the dramatic and shocking introduction. The attention is guaranteed with the use of words such as “vagina,” “bold, erect, hard penis,” and “stupid.”

The actual role modeling is presented not only by the content of Erickson’s suggestions, but also by his light and humorous attitude, as he restates and reframes the problem and then presents a reframed way of looking at the behavior that the patient was exhibiting, in her attempts to “live.” The problem—fear of men and self-hate—is restated as “You tell me you’re afraid of a bold, erect, hard penis.” The word “afraid” condenses her fear, not only of men, but also of life. She is firmly told that this fear is “stupid” (and she is accustomed to thinking of herself as stupid). The sentence “And that bold, hard penis can enter your vagina” is a posthypnotic suggestion, which, when followed, will recall to the patient a somewhat maternal, whimsical view of the previously threatening penis—the “bold, hard penis,” which he has mocked by repetition of the phrase.

The final, elegant step of reframing for the patient is expressed in the sentence “And your vagina can take a vicious pleasure in reducing it to a helpless dangling object.”

For the reader, the final stage in role modeling is the resolution or cure, which, in this case, Erickson has the patient describe. When he, or when someone else, tells the tale, we are left with a hope that problems of this sort can be solved. As I have suggested, “problems of this sort” would not be limited to sexual difficulties resulting from incest, but might include phobic fears, anxiety-provoking situations, or problems with assertiveness. The metaphors in this tale provide many “pegs” on which problems of assertiveness, anger, and helplessness may be hung.

“Vicious Pleasure” is a beautiful example of the use of reframing to change a feeling of passive helplessness to one of active mastery. It also demonstrates how reframing can be used to help someone to move into the “one-up” position. Although the patient emphasized her fear and helplessness, Erickson recognized that she also had a strong feeling of resentment toward men. He tied this feeling of resentment to a potential feeling of pleasure and came up with the evocative phrase “vicious pleasure.”

After reading this story, will we be more inclined to own up to feelings of resentment and take responsibility? Will we be better able to reach out toward the forces that we feel are pressuring us, and get pleasure from mastering them and reducing them to helplessness?

A therapist who uses Erickson’s teaching tales is likely to experience a lessening of his own customary anxiety. Hence, he will be better able to focus on the business at hand—helping the patient to be more open, to find novel solutions and new frames of reference. Simply having a repertoire of stories can give the therapist a feeling of mastery, control, and competence. Also, as he reads or tells an Erickson tale, the therapist is likely to enter into a trance himself, either because of his associations to Erickson or because of the intrinsic “hypnotic effect” of the story. In the trance state the therapist will not only be less anxious; he will also be more open to his own unconscious associations. Therefore, he will be better able to help the patient lose his own anxieties, explore his inner potentials, and find different ways of viewing situations.

I have found that the best way for the therapist to select stories is through his own free associations. By this I mean not only cognitive free associations, but also bodily responses, emotions, perceptions, and, particularly, imagery associations. Here is an example of my use of Erickson’s stories in the treatment of two different patients.

The first patient, a thirty-year-old Hasidic Jew, had been referred to me by his wife. She had read about Erickson’s treatment techniques and felt I might be able to help her husband overcome his long-term inability to awaken at a reasonable hour. Since he was in the tenth grade at the Yeshiva, he had never been able to awaken before 11 A.M. or 12 noon. Because of this, he had been unable to hold a job but made a good adaptation in a family business. He had been married for about one year, and his wife now found it annoying and inconvenient to spend an hour trying to wake him up every morning.

During our first session, the patient told me that he had been hypnotized several times by a well-known hypnotherapist. The hypnotherapist was satisfied that the patient was hypnotized, but he himself was not. I put him through a standard hypnotic induction procedure, using arm-levitation and eye-fixation techniques. He was able to achieve both eye closure and a feeling of heaviness in his arm. However, at the end of the session he insisted that he was not hypnotized, that he had been merely cooperative, in spite of my caution that he try not to be cooperative. After this first session, he phoned me. He said that when his wife heard about our hypnotic procedure, she doubted it was really “uncommon” enough to qualify as an Ericksonian approach.

At our second session, I immediately told the patient, “We have already determined that you cannot be hypnotized to your satisfaction, even though both the other hypnotist and I thought that you were hypnotized. Therefore, we will not waste any further time trying to convince you that you can be hypnotized.”

The patient then described a case history that he and his wife had read about: Erickson treated an enuretic couple by having them kneel on their bed every night and deliberately urinate. They then slept in the wet sheets. This, my patient felt, was “Ericksonian” therapy.

I began a long, rather rambling discussion of the value of the unconscious mind, during which the patient obviously relaxed, let his eyelids close, and appeared to have entered into a hypnotic trance. I did not challenge him regarding the depth of his trance. While I was talking, however, I began associating to the story of the enuretics, and I recalled Erickson’s comment at the end of another story. He had said, “Do you want a surefire technique for living a long life? Wake up every morning! And, to ensure that you will wake up every morning, drink a lot of fluid before you go to sleep and you have to wake up—to go to the bathroom to urinate.”

I told the patient this story and then suggested to him that he drink at least one quart of liquid an hour before he went to sleep each night, and that, over a period of two weeks, he push forward his time of going to sleep by a half an hour each night. He had been going to sleep at about 3 A.M. and awakening at about 11 A.M. I suggested that he start going to sleep at about two o’clock, one-thirty, one, and, finally, at midnight, when his wife went to sleep. I also told him not to lie in bed awake. The bed must be associated with sleep or with lovemaking. If he was awake he must leave the bed, go into the living room, and read or watch television. Then he was to drink at least a quart of liquid before he went to sleep. This, I assured him, would cause his bladder to become full in six to eight hours and he would have to get out of bed, in order to urinate.

After he urinated, he was to take a shower, terminating with cold water, if possible. Then he was to dress, have breakfast, and proceed to work without ever returning to bed.

The patient objected that he did not like to take showers in the morning and usually took them at night. I insisted, again, that he was to take them in the morning—at least until he had overcome his waking-up problem. He promised he would do this and would call me in two or three weeks to let me know how this plan had worked. Two weeks later he called to report that he was having no problem with sleeping or waking.

The next day, I saw a sophisticated and intelligent woman who had initially contacted me for help in dealing with a painfully inflamed bladder, as well as sleep problems. At the beginning of the session I was not consciously thinking about her bladder difficulties. I knew that she had appeared in court the preceding week to finalize her divorce proceedings, but she appeared quite calm and pleasant as she entered my office. I know she was interested in Erickson’s therapeutic approaches and told her about my experience with the Hasidic Jew.

I told her the story about my having advised him to drink the water before going to sleep, and I ended by adding Erickson’s final comment when he had told the story. This was “We all begin to die from the moment we are born. Some do it faster than others. All we can do is enjoy our lives.”

My patient began to weep copiously. I asked her if she wanted to tell me why she was weeping. (I wondered whether it was connected with the association to her urinary problems and my talk about urination.) She said that the talk about death had made her feel that her life was finished. This conviction had been building for some time. She felt that in spite of her professional success, and in spite of the fact that she had successfully raised two children, she no longer had any reason for living.

She related this feeling to the fact that her parents had never divorced, although they had separated when she was about eleven years old. Her mother forbade her to have anything to do with her father. This would be seen as a sign of disloyalty to the mother. Therefore, the patient felt that she had been denied a relationship with her father. She felt that if her parents had divorced she would have been free to see her father. Her father would have been free to have visitation rights and so on, and they would have had a relationship. Thus, she associated her divorce with freeing her own children. At the same time, she felt that her life was finished, now that she had completed this act.

This made me think of another story, which I then told her. I had had a dream after my first visit with Erickson. In the dream I had seen the words “You never finish anything.” Seven years later, while I was listening to some Erickson tapes in Phoenix, I had an insight: “Who says that you have to finish anything? Nothing is ever really finished as long as we are alive.”

I told the patient this story and suggested that perhaps she could conceive of her life as a continuation of the life of her parents, and of her children’s life as a continuation of her life. And the process would continue as long as there was human life on earth. She found this thought comforting.

The main point of this rather long summary of two therapeutic hours with two different patients is that my selection of stories was not determined by any preconceived notions but arose from my own free associations, which were influenced by my life experiences, refined by more than thirty years of clinical experience. It is also important to emphasize that the process took place in the context of a good therapeutic relationship.

The patients selected parts that applied to themselves. They were not necessarily parts that I thought they might have selected. But they were helpful.

The danger in using these tales, as in the use of imagination in general, is that the imaginary experience can become a substitute for real-life experience. If one felt that he had already succeeded in satisfying life’s needs, there would be no need for getting out of bed in the morning. Of course, when a therapist espouses a philosophy of activism, as Erickson did, he would never encourage a “do-nothing” type of existence. Those who listen to his stories are not likely to withdraw from life.

Sometimes my patients will note that even though they have an exciting session in the therapist’s office, fantasizing and even imagining successful resolutions of conflicts, there is no carryover. They complain that “there hasn’t been any change in me. I am still not doing anything differently outside this office.” Sometimes in such cases, it is best for the patient to remain silent and passive while I tell an Ericksonian tale. It may be a long, boring tale of childhood development. The patient will claim, at the end of the session, that this session was not as “good” as previous sessions and will state that he prefers to be more active. He may say that he was bored. I will remind him that the work that we are trying to achieve is on an unconscious level and that it does not matter what his conscious mind does. Subsequently, he may report major changes in his life. He has been, for example, more assertive socially, has established new relationships, or has changed a job. In other words, his activity takes place outside of the session. During the session, I assume responsibility for activity.

Of course, some patients may resent being told a story that was created by someone other than their own therapist. They may prefer a more personalized approach. Books, such as Therapeutic Metaphors, by David Gordon, inspired by Erickson’s use of metaphors, provide help for those who would like to use Erickson’s general approach while creating their own metaphors.

Obviously, the mere reading or telling of one or more of these tales is not likely to result in a transformation. Transformation is more likely to occur when the recipient, and perhaps the transmitter (as I will call the therapist), is in a receptive state. As previously mentioned, this receptive state is often most easily and quickly achieved by the inducing of a hypnotic trance. The optimal therapeutic relationship is not what is often called “positive transference.” Rather, it is one in which there is a state of “rapport” between therapist and patient. Then, the unconscious mind of the patient and the therapist are most fully responsive to one another. If one reads these stories in the so-called waking state, one might dismiss them as being “clichéd,” “corny,” or “of interest, but not enlightening.” Yet, in the hypnotic state, where everything that is said by the therapist is heightened in meaning, a story, or a single word in a story, may trigger a mini satori—the Zen term for enlightenment.
