title: APPLICATIONS OF THE TEACHING TALES IN THERAPY
---




One of Erickson’s most important and useful approaches could be called “mind reading.” By observing the patient carefully and by mirroring his behavior and responses, Erickson gives the patient the feeling that his mind is being read and that Erickson really knows him. This kind of “knowing” leads to a very intimate relationship. “Rapport,” which is imperative in all kinds of psychotherapy, is apparently formed more quickly during hypnotic therapy than in other forms of psychotherapy. (In this regard, it is of interest that Anton Mesmer was the first one to use the term “rapport” in conjunction with therapy.) Most therapists, regardless of their “school,” will agree that this rapport, the “doctor-patient relationship,” is of central importance. A strong therapeutic relationship leads the patient to feel understood, safe, and secure. With this support he may then venture into both inner and outer worlds with greater confidence and with a greater readiness to take risks.

The type of “knowing” referred to here is quite different from the usual way in which an analytic therapist gets to know “about” a patient. In fact, it was not necessary for Erickson to acquire a great deal of information about a patient’s background, or even about his symptoms. There is some truth to the speculation that his knowing was “intuitive,” but only if we understand that Erickson’s intuition was grounded in years of careful and painstaking training in observing. His observations pertained not only to simple matters such as body movements, breathing, and pulse rate (seen in the neck), but also to the patient’s responses, as he listened to the tales. For example, if a patient tightened up at a certain point in a story, this was a clue that some relevant point had been touched upon. Erickson might then utilize another story, or elaborate on the same one, in ways that enhanced the patient’s responsiveness. Thus, the stories are not only therapeutic but also diagnostic.

The teaching tales were always used and must always be applied in conjunction with other principles of Ericksonian therapy. These principles include those that have been outlined by Haley and others, such as symptom prescription, utilization of the resistance, and reframing. Activities, and even ordeals, are often prescribed. Change occurs as a result of the interaction between these activities and inner psychic shifting, in the context of a close and trusting doctor-patient relationship.

As he states in the book Hypnotherapy, Erickson applied the principles of getting the patient’s attention through surprise, shock, doubt, and confusion, with the generous use of implications, questions, puns, and humor in his stories. Each story has a structure and plot, often with a surprise ending. The stories often build to a climax, followed by a feeling of relief or success. The use of the teaching tales demonstrates a principle that Erickson outlined in Hypnotic Realities, that is: “When dealing with a problem of difficulty make an interesting design out of it. Then you can concentrate on the interesting design and ignore the back-breaking labor involved.” First, you identify an interesting design in the patient’s responses and symptoms. Next you select a tale or tales that provide first an analogue of the patient’s designs and then a better design. Or, as Erickson told his daughter-in-law, “Cookie,” “First you model the patient’s world. Then you role-model the patient’s world.” The following tale, “Vicious Pleasure,” gives an example.
