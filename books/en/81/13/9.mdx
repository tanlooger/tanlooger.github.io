title: SLAMMING DOORS
---




My grandson Douglas came into my office while I was conducting a teaching seminar. After showing off his new sneakers he left. About forty minutes later he returned, while I was in the middle of a demonstration of deepening of trance.

I told him, “Run along, Douglas,” and he answered impudently, “I couldn’t hear you.”

“Run along,” I repeated, “go into the house.”

Douglas left, slamming the door. Obviously he didn’t like that. He shouldn’t have slammed the door. Now, if he were my child, I would graciously ask him, for no apparent reason, “Please slam the door.” I would do this while he was busy looking at a picture book. He’d wonder why, but would obediently do it. I’d thank him and ask him to slam the door again. He’d slam it again, wondering. And I’d ask him to slam the door again.

He’d say, “But I want to read my book.”

“Well, just slam it again,” I’d insist.

He’d slam it again and pretty soon he’d inquire why I had asked him to slam the door. I’d remind him of the original slamming and say, “The way you slammed the door made me think you liked to slam doors.”

His answer would be, “I really don’t like to slam doors.”

You learn very rapidly in situations that are not to your inclination.




As in “Spanking,” Erickson supplies the right medicine. In this situation, having Douglas slam the door when it was not to his “inclination” would lead him to discover that he really didn’t “like” to slam doors. It would drive home to him that the door slamming had been unconsciously determined or reactive, rather than something he “wanted” to do. In the future, presumably, he would exercise more control over his actions, doing what he really “wanted” to do. At least he would have more awareness of what he was doing.

We have seen Erickson apply this principle in many different situations—with children, with neurotic patients, and even with psychotics. He would either “mirror” the patient’s undesirable behavior or would have the patient repeat it, under his orders, as with “symptom prescription.” He never resorted to sarcasm, irritability, or hostility. His attitude could best be described as a “wondering” one: “I wonder what will happen if I ask Douglas to slam the door?”

Erickson himself maintained that “childlike” wondering attitude, the attitude of the true scientist, to the very end.
