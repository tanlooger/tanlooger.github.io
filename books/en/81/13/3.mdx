title: HEIDI-HO, THE SIX-YEAR-OLD KLEPTOMANIAC
---




A couple came to see me, in despair, asking, “What can we do with our six-year-old daughter? She steals from us. She steals from our friends and from her friends. When she goes shopping with her mother, she steals from the store. We sent her to a girls’ camp for the day and she came home with things belonging to other girls, things that even had other girls’ names on them. She tells lies about her mother buying things for her. She insists that they are hers. Can anything be done with a kleptomaniac at that age? With a shoplifter at that age? With a liar who is only six years old?”

I told them I’d take care of it. I wrote a letter to the girl:

“Dear Heidi-Ho, I am your six-year-old-growing-up fairy. Every child has a growing-up fairy. Nobody sees a growing-up fairy. You’ve never seen me. Maybe you’d like to know what I look like. I’ve got eyes on top of my head, in front of my head, and under my chin. That’s so I can see everything that my child, for whom I am a growing-up fairy, does.

“Now, I have been watching you slowly learning things. I’ve been very pleased with the way you learned a lot of things. Some things are harder to learn than others. And I have ears too. I don’t have any ears on top of my head, because they would interfere with my eyes seeing everything. I have ears in swivel joints on my cheeks so I can turn them in any direction I wish, to hear everything, in all directions. And I have a lot of ears here down my neck and side and all over my hind legs, all down my tail. And the ear on the end of my tail is very large—it is on a swivel joint. (Ask your dad to tell you what a swivel joint is.) So I can turn that ear in any direction I wish, so I can hear everything that you say or any noise that you make, when you are doing things.

“I’ve got one right foot and three left front feet. I use two left front feet to walk with—the outside ones. The inside foot has thirty-two toes on it. That’s why my writing is poor, because I can’t remember which toes to put the pencil between. And of course I walk twice as fast on my left side as I do on my right side. So I can keep going in a straight line. I have seven hind feet—three of my left hind feet and three of my right hind feet, so I can keep my right side going just as fast as my left side goes. And I like to go around barefoot, and you know how hot it gets in summer in Phoenix. So I wear shoes on two of my seven hind feet. I keep the others bare.”

I got an invitation for a seven-year-old birthday and I had to decline attending because I was a six-year-old-growing-up fairy. I didn’t specialize in seven-year-olds, but was a six-year-old-growing-up fairy, who would keep watching her and listening to her. And that story kept her straight.




In supplying input from which a child can develop a healthy conscience, Erickson notably avoids prohibitions, “shoulds,” and rules. He emphasizes, as always, the value of learning. As in the preceding story, the disciplinarian is not angry but, in fact, presents his teachings in an amusing way. In all his discipline stories, Erickson is firm but not punitive, even though some readers may see his approach as punitive or as a battle of wills. Actually, his purpose is to help the child develop his own sense of will and autonomy.

In this case of a young child who had already been labeled a kleptomaniac, Erickson does not become involved with the “dynamics” of kleptomania. He decides, instead, that the child needs an internalized superego and, through the medium of a letter written to appeal to a child, he supplies that internal guardian and watchdog.
