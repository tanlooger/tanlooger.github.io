title: GARBAGE
---




Children have poor memories, but I have an excellent memory for them.

Robert announced one day, “I’m old enough and big enough and strong enough to carry out the garbage every night.”

I expressed my doubts. He staunchly defended his ability. I said, “All right, next Monday you can begin.”

He carried it out Monday and Tuesday, but forgot Wednesday. On Thursday I reminded him and he took the garbage out, but forgot it on Friday and Saturday. So, that Saturday I gave him a lot of active games, which he enjoyed immensely and which were tiring. And then as a special favor, I let him stay awake as late as he wished. At one o’clock he said, “I think I want to go to bed now.”

I let him go to bed. By some coincidence, I awakened at three o’clock. I wakened Robert and I offered apologies all over the map for not reminding him to take out the garbage that night. Would he please dress and take out the garbage? So, with great reluctance, he dressed. I apologized again for not reminding him, and he took out the garbage.

He took his clothes off, put on his pajamas, and got back into bed. I was sure he was sound asleep. I wakened him again. This time I was even more apologetic. I told him I didn’t know how that piece of garbage got overlooked in the kitchen. Would he please dress and take that garbage out. He took it out, to the garbage can in the alley. He walked back, thinking hard, and reached the back porch. Then he turned and dashed back to the alley and checked the cover of the garbage can to make sure that he had put it on correctly.

He stopped when he came in and gave the kitchen the once-over again, before he went back to his bedroom. I was still apologizing. He went back to bed and he never again forgot to take out the garbage.




In fact, Robert remembered this lesson so well that when I mentioned that I was writing the story, he groaned reminiscently.
