title: SATURDAY CLASSES ON SUNDAY
---




A medical student forgot to attend Saturday classes. He always awakened Saturday morning, went out, and played golf, always completely forgetting it was still a class day. Until he hit my class.

I explained to him that the week has seven days, that Saturday was a school day, and I would give him a lesson, not on Saturday, but on Sunday, which was not a regular class day, and he would remember that Saturday was a class day thereafter.

So I said, “Tomorrow morning, on Sunday, at 8 A.M., come twenty miles out to Wayne County Hospital, walk into my office, and wait for me. If I’m a few minutes late, don’t think I’ve forgotten you; I haven’t. So just stick around for the assignment, and when you’ve completed the assignment, you can go home at four o’clock.”

You know, I forgot I told him that. And he sat in my office all day, until four o’clock.

He came to my office the next Sunday at 8 A.M., praying I would remember. Again I had forgotten.

The third Sunday, I gave him a nice, interesting series of patients to interview. They were so interesting that he didn’t want to go home at four o’clock. He stayed until five o’clock. He never again forgot a Saturday class.




The same principle is applied here as in the story “I Don’t Has To”—the tables are turned. Since the student forgot to attend the Saturday classes, Erickson “forgets” to attend the scheduled meetings on Sundays. Why did the student dutifully travel twenty miles, to arrive at 8 A.M. on Sundays, even after Erickson failed to show? We can only speculate about this. Perhaps he was pleased to be singled out for individual attention. Perhaps the “ordeal” aspect of Erickson’s “prescription” appealed to him. Other patients and students certainly tended to carry out Erickson’s ordeals. In any case, Erickson finally rewarded the student by giving him some interesting patients to interview, so that the experience became a positive one. Subsequently, the student was able, and perhaps eager, to turn up at Saturday classes, anticipating further positive contacts with Erickson.

Note that this discipline was not applied in a punitive or vindictive way. On some level, the student knew, just as Kristi did, that Erickson was not angry, but was really helping him to develop self-discipline.
