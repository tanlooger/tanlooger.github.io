title: EASTER BUNNY LETTERS
---




One mother brought her seven-year-old and said, “Her two older siblings have shaken her belief in Santa Claus—and she is desperately hanging on to her belief in the Easter Bunny. And I’d like to have her believe in the Easter Bunny one more year, because by the time she is eight she won’t believe it, but she wants to believe in it now.”

I wrote this girl an Easter Bunny letter, telling her about all my hard times, hopping around and getting my feet sore, trying to find the hardest-boiled Easter egg in the world. I thought she deserved that. I wrote, “And I miscalculated when I jumped over a cactus and got some stickers where it hurt. I was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake. I got a ride with a wild burro. It was a kindly burro, but an awfully stupid burro. He took me in the wrong direction and I had to hop all the way back. Then I wasn’t smart enough to know better than to take a ride with a jack rabbit on a dead run, taking me in the wrong direction and I had to hop all the way back again!”

I said, “I’m not going to take any more rides. I think hitchhiking is very bad.”

And she took that Easter Bunny letter to “show-and-tell” at school and at Easter got the hardest-boiled egg in the world—an onyx egg!

And people are still calling me up, asking me to play Santa Claus over the phone with their children, the same way I did when their parents were my patients.

Three little girls for six weeks every morning hopped out of bed and rushed to the letter slot in the door to get their letter from the Easter Bunny. I sent them daily accounts of my travels. And always the stationery was different. And they got the hardest-boiled eggs in the world. And I got a lot of my Easter Bunny letters taken to “show-and-tell.”




Erickson demonstrates the principle that the therapist can supply what is needed or missing. In “Heidi-Ho,” the young child needed an internalized superego. In “The Easter Bunny Letters,” the child needed evidence that Easter Bunnies existed. If bunnies can write letters, they must exist! Strictly speaking, this tale is not aimed at instilling values, yet this kind of story, heard when young, may predispose a person to value fantasy and whimsy later in life.
