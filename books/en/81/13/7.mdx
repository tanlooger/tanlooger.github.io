title: JILL, HER OWN STYLE
---




I received a letter from my one-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter; her mother did the writing. One-and-a-half-year-old Jill went to the swimming pool for the first time. And she cried when her foot got wet. She cried and clung to her mother when her hand got wet. And finally she cried and cried and cried, and clung tightly until her mother let Jill direct the operation entirely.

Now she’s planning her next trip to the pool, and teaching mother, “Let me deal with it on my terms.”

All my grandchildren have had a different approach to life, and they are very decisive. When they want to do something, they do it but they do it in their own style. And their mother is able to describe it in detail. I’m keeping their letters so they can eventually be bound into a volume for the kids when they are sixteen or seventeen and are bemoaning the lack of intelligence in their parents.




The important phrase is “they do it in their own style.” Erickson applies this principle to children as well as patients. It is always up to the patients to choose their own solution. This reinforces a child’s or a patient’s tendency toward respecting his own values and learning self-discipline.
