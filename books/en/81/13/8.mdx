title: SPANKING
---




One day my son Lance came home from grade school and he said, “Daddy, all the other kids at school get spankings and I haven’t ever had a spanking. So I want a spanking.”

I said, “There’s no reason to spank you.”

He said, “I’ll give you one,” and he went outside and broke one of the windows of the hospital.

He came back and asked me, “Now, can I get a spanking?”

I said, “No, the proper thing to do is replace the pane of glass for the window. A spanking won’t do that.”

He was disgusted and went out and broke another windowpane. He said, “Now will you spank me?”

I said, “No, I will replace the windowpane.” In all, he broke seven panes of glass. While he was out breaking the seventh pane, I was on the balcony of our apartment. I lined up seven of his cast-iron trucks on the railing. He came in to announce, “I broke the seventh pane of glass; now will you spank me?”

I said, “No, replace the panes is what I’ll do.” Then I said, “Now, here are seven of your trucks on the railing. I’m going to start the first one rolling down the railing. I hope it will stop and not roll off, crash, and break on the sidewalk below. Oh, that’s too bad! Maybe the second one will stop.”

He lost seven trucks. About three weeks later he came home from school very happy. I seized him, put him over my knees, and spanked him. He said, “Why are you doing that?”

I said, “I seem to remember that you asked me to spank you. I didn’t meet your wishes.”

He said, “I know better now.”

Of course I didn’t spank him very hard. It was a token spanking.




Erickson is illustrating a principle he applied both to disciplining children and to treating patients. He does not give what is asked for. Rather, he gives what is called for. And he gives it when he deems it to be appropriate. We saw this in his teaching Robert to fulfill his promise to be responsible for taking out the garbage. In that case, he “reminded” Robert in the middle of the night, knowing that this type of reminder would be remembered. And we see something similar in the next story, where he has someone do something at a time that is inconvenient for him.
