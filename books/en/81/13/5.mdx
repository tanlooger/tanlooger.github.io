title: ROBERT—HE DOES IT WELL
---




When my son Robert was seven years old, he and a truck tried to use the street at the same time and he lost. The police picked me up to identify the boy with a spelling paper in his pocket with the name “Bobby” on it. I looked at Robert in the Good Samaritan Hospital and told them, “Yes, that is my son.” I asked the emergency-room doctor, “What’s the damage?” He said, “Both thighs are broken. The pelvis is fractured. The skull is fractured and he has a concussion. We’re checking him for internal injuries at the present time.”

I waited until they told me he had no internal injuries. Then I asked, “What’s the prognosis?

And the doctor said, “Well, if he lives forty-eight hours, he may have a chance to live.”

I went home, called all the family together and said, “We all know Robert. We know that when Robert has to do something he does it. He does it very well. Now, at the present time, Robert is in Good Samaritan Hospital. A truck ran over him and broke both his legs, fractured his pelvis, fractured his skull, and bumped his brains so bad that he has what is called a concussion. So he doesn’t know anybody. And he can’t think straight. And we’ll have to wait forty-eight hours before we’ll know if Robert will live. Now, we all know Robert. When he does things, he does them well. You can always take pride in what Robert does.

“If you want to shed a couple of tears, it’s all right. But I think it would be very disrespectful of Robert if you did a lot of crying. Out of respect for Robert, I think you ought to do all your home chores. I think you ought to eat a good supper. I think you ought to do all your homework. And I want you to go to bed on time. Go to sleep on time and sleep restfully all night. You owe Robert that respect.”

A couple of the kids shed a couple of tears, ate a good meal and did all their chores, then washed dishes, did their homework. They went to bed on time.

In forty-eight hours we knew that Robert was going to live.

I told them all that we ought to leave Robert alone in the hospital where he had a very hard job—that is, getting well. Now, if we went over and visited him, it would take a lot of his energy and he needed that energy to get well. I didn’t know it, but my wife would slip over to the hospital every day, walk in, sit down quietly by the bed. Sometimes Robert would turn over, turn his back to her. Sometimes he’d tell her, “Go home.” Sometimes he’d ask her a question or two, and then tell her to go home. She did whatever he told her to.

We sent Robert plenty of presents. We always had the nurse deliver them. We never gave him anything personally.

I’d go over, go to the nurses’ station, look through the window so I could see how Robert was getting along. Robert didn’t know I was there.

The accident happened on December 5, and Robert came home from the hospital in a body cast, late in March. The stretcher men who brought him into the house almost dropped him. And Robert was very excited. As he was brought in to the living room Robert said, “I’m so glad I’ve got parents like you. Never once did you come to the hospital. And all the other poor kids, their parents came every afternoon and made them cry. Then they came every evening, and made the poor kids cry again. And on Sundays it was awful. I just hated those parents who wouldn’t let their kids get well.”

During my internship, I took the temperature, breathing rate, pulse, an hour before patients received their visitors. An hour after the visitors left I took their pulse, respiration, and blood pressure. Every time a patient had a visitor, his temperature went up. His breathing rate became exaggerated and the blood pressure increased. I made up my mind then, if I ever had children or a wife in the hospital, I wouldn’t visit until I knew it would be safe for the blood pressure, heart rate, and their breathing, and for their temperature. Patients in a hospital need to use their strength to get well and not to make their relatives who are well and healthy feel better.




This story was told in response to the question, “Do you believe that it’s necessary to feel the pain of grief or loss? Shouldn’t that be worked through?” Most readers will feel that Erickson’s behavior was strange and cold for a parent. Yet he sincerely believed that when a person is seriously ill he should be left alone to do his own “work” of healing, and that visitors are enervating. He is obviously overstating his case somewhat, since he mentions that Mrs. Erickson did sit by the child’s bed every day (“I didn’t know it”). And he, himself, apparently could not avoid going to the nurses’ station frequently (“so I could see how Robert was getting along”). Also, the Erickson children must have learned very early that they were expected not to make a fuss about illness and loss. They took pride in being self-sufficient.

After hearing this story, a student asked Erickson rather angrily why he didn’t visit his son and use some of his hypnosis on him, “to help him get better faster.” Erickson answered, “The kids couldn’t have lived with me all their lives without learning something. I taught the kids the unimportance of pain and importance of physical comfort. For example, when Roxanna scratched her knee, she was really announcing it to the whole city. Her mother came out and looked at it; so did I. Her mother said, ‘Mother will kiss it here and here and then right on top, so all the pain will go away.’ It’s marvelous how anesthetic a mother’s kiss can be.”

He is saying indirectly that for small scratches, it is all right to use “motherly” comforting. In serious, life-threatening situations, it is best to leave the patient alone as much as possible. In his response, Erickson is also correcting a serious misconception about self-hypnosis. He is saying that it is not necessary to go through ritualistic induction in order to achieve self-hypnotic effects. Simple awareness of “the unimportance of pain and the importance of physical comfort” can produce the same effect as hypnotic induction in which the patient is told these things by a “hypnotist.” In other words, if one has accepted a value or belief, the effect on his responses is as permanent as if he had been “hypnotized” into acceptance.

Erickson is not only conveying his ideas about visiting the sick. He is actually saying that the parent or the helper must stand by and be available when called for; help is offered only to the extent that the recipient wants it. When Robert told Betty Erickson to “go home,” she would do so.

If we examine the story on an intrapsychic level, we see that the “child” again determines what is best for himself. Interference by the adults simply delays healing or growth. This delay is manifested in very basic ways. Erickson’s tales often focus on blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. This strategy is part of his indirect hypnotic inductions. In this tale, he is pointing out that there is a disruption of natural physiological responses—of natural functioning—when parents impose their anxieties on a child. Or when the “parent” in an individual—the “inner sounds”—are operating on an anxious level. When this happens, “the kids cry.” Intrapsychically, we have a feeling of sadness or self-hate, in Horney’s terms, when the “shoulds” are too stringent. In the commentary at the end of the story, however, Erickson emphasizes the fact that the “mother” can accomplish marvelous results with a kiss. In other words, the ability to be a good mother to ourselves, loving ourselves, can have an “anesthetic” effect, that is, it can relieve inner pain and doubt. This is similar to the ideas expressed by Antonia Wenkart in her papers on “Acceptance,” and by Theodore Rubin in Compassion and Self-Hate.

And, of course, therapists must not interfere when their patients are doing good work.
