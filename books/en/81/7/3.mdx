Learning by experience is much more educational than learning consciously. You can learn all the movements of swimming while you’re lying on your belly on a piano stool. You can establish your rhythms, breathing, head movement, arm movements, feet movements, and so on. When you get into the water, you only know how to dog-paddle. You have to learn to swim in the water. And when you have learned that, you have got a learning.

Learning experientially is the most important thing. Now, we have all learned while we are going to school that we should learn consciously. You did things unconsciously, in relationship to the water. And you learned to roll your head, paddle with your hands, and kick with your feet in a certain rhythm—in relationship to the water. And any of you who are not swimmers don’t know, can’t describe to me, the feeling of your feet in water, the feeling of water on your hands, the suction of the water as you turn your body right and left in the Australian crawl, for example.

When you swim on your back you know about this. How much attention do you pay to the spring of the water under your back as you swim backwards? If you have ever gone skinny-dipping, you will find out what a horrible drag a bathing suit is. The water skips over your skin so much more easily when you are in the nude. And the swimming suit is definitely a handicap.

I am not concerned with how much any of you learn about hypnosis here in this room, because all of you know, from time to time—in that neither-here-nor-there period, when you are not asleep and not awake—you learn a whole lot, in that hypnagogic state, about hypnosis. I used to like to awaken in the morning, have my feet hit the floor as I opened my eyes, and my wife always liked to take fifteen to twenty minutes to wake up slowly, gradually. My blood supply goes instantly to my head. Her blood supply goes very slowly. We all have our own individual patterns. How many times do you have to go into a trance, maybe a dozen times, until you lose interest in watching the experience yourself?

Have you ever taken a swim in the Great Salt Lake? It looks like water, and feels like water. I knew ahead of time that I couldn’t swim in it. I wondered what would happen if I tried to swim. I had all the understanding of the lake being supersaturated salt water. But I had to have the experience of trying to swim before I could figure out what would happen to a swimmer who tried to swim. And most hypnotic subjects want to understand as they experience. Keep the experience separate. Just let things happen.




Erickson is emphasizing awareness of the body through tactile experience. As he mentions various sensations, rhythms, movements, the listener cannot help remembering similar experiences. Instead of saying, “Those of you who are swimmers can recall the feeling of your feet in the water…,” Erickson puts the statement in the negative and says, “Any of you who are not swimmers can’t describe….” Later he makes the suggestion by asking, “How much attention do you pay to the spring of the water under your back as you swim backwards?” He is implying that it is good and worthwhile to focus one’s attention on sensory experience.

When Erickson says, “I am not concerned with how much any of you learn about hypnosis here in this room [emphasis mine],” he is offering a long-term posthypnotic suggestion that learning about hypnosis will continue outside of this room. He then elaborates by indirectly suggesting that “this learning” will occur in various special situations such as on awakening. He also suggests that each listener will do “this learning” according to his own “individual patterns.” He explains that experiential learning is best done when one is simply experiencing and not examining the experience. He slips in another posthypnotic suggestion—that this will happen after twelve trance experiences. In his later comments, he again emphasizes the importance of not trying to understand experience while it is occurring. This principle applies, of course, to all experiencing, not only to hypnotic experiencing. If one wants to understand experiences it is best that the examining, reviewing, and analyzing be left to a later time, when one has achieved some distance from the experience.

Telling a story such as this one to patients in sex therapy can be very helpful. It would be a good introduction to the description of sensate focus exercises, for example. For patients who are alienated from their sensations, it can be productive to focus on tactile sensations.
