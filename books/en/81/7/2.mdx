title: DREAMING

When you go to bed at night you go to bed to sleep, perchance to dream. And in your dream, you do not intellectualize, you experience. I refused to give some candy to my son Lance. I told him that he had already had enough. The next morning he awakened, very happy. He told me, “I ate the whole sack full.”

And when I showed him that the sack still contained candy he thought that I must have gone out and bought some more because he knew that he had eaten it. And he had eaten it—in his dream.

Another time, Bert had teased Lance and Lance wanted me to punish Bert. I refused. The next morning Lance said, “I am glad you gave Bert a licking—but you did not have to use such a big baseball bat.” He knew I had punished Bert severely. He turned his guilt over wishing that his father would punish Bert into criticism of the severity of my punishment. So, something had happened to him.

Many subjects who tend to intellectualize, instead of going into a trance, will, some night, when they are thinking about other matters, dream that they are in a trance. And, in that trance state of the dream, they will do certain things. They will come and tell you the next day, “I dreamed a solution to that problem.” Therapy is primarily a motivation of the unconscious to make use of all its many and varied learnings.




There are all kinds of experience, and dreaming is one kind of experience. In this story, Erickson is also pointing out that even though the hypnosis may not work, the therapy might. That is, the patient may go home and complete the work in a dream. After having been told this story, an intellectualizing patient may go home and dream that he is in a trance.
