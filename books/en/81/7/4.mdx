title: TAKE A TASTE
---




My son Bert could have been an excellent psychiatrist, but he chose farming. He had six boys and one girl. He was concerned about his kids’ taking up tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and so on. So, from the very beginning he would show them harmless but interesting-looking stuff, like axle grease. When the kids asked about it, he’d say, “Why don’t you take a taste?” Or, he would take a pretty bottle: “Why don’t you smell it?” And ammonia isn’t pleasant to smell! Every one of the kids learned to be very worried about what they put into their mouths. It was a good way of growing up.




Erickson again expresses his conviction that the best way for people to learn is through experience. The parent, teacher, or therapist provides the opportunity for experience. Bert does not need to provide an actual experience with tobacco, alcohol, or drugs, since he has taught his children, by experience, “to be very worried about what they put into their mouths.” He has provided them with experiences, during their formative years, that would lead them to be discriminating. Once they have learned discrimination, they can be trusted to decide for themselves about using tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.
