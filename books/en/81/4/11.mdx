title: DELVING

When my daughter was in medical school she read a paper on double binds by Ernest Rossi and me. She came in and said, “So that’s how I do it!”

Rossi asked her, “That’s how you do what?”

She said, “All patients have the right to refuse a rectal, hernial, or vaginal examination by a medical student. None of the other female students have done any and I have done vaginal, rectal, and hernial examinations on every one of my patients.”

I asked her how she did it, since they all had the right to refuse.

She said, “When I got to that part of the examination I smiled prettily and said very sympathetically, ‘I know you are tired of me peering into your eyes and peeking into your ears and up your nose and down your throat, poking you here and thumping you there. Now, as soon as I do the rectal and hernial you can say good-bye to me.’”

And they all waited patiently to say good-bye to her.




This approach is an excellent example of the setting up of a double bind. In order for the weary patients to get Kristi to leave them alone, they must first permit her to do the rectal, vaginal, and hernial exams. First, though, she joined them by verbalizing their weariness and their desire to be left alone.

When this tale was told to me, it evoked, by indirect suggestion, the feeling that I should ask Erickson, “Go ahead. Do the rectal.” In other words, I felt that he was asking for permission to delve deeper into my unconscious mind. I immediately found myself remembering long-forgotten early childhood memories of enemas. I have found that when patients feel that they are being helped, or even forced to bring out deeply buried “gut feelings” and memories, they will often dream or fantasize about enemas or rectal examinations. The focusing on vaginal and hernial examinations might very well, in some patients, bring forth associations to sexual feelings and experiences.
