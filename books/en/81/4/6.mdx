title: WET DREAMS
---




A woman had secured a divorce because she went all numb sexually and this had troubled her husband very much. He couldn’t stand living with an unresponsive woman.

Then she had a number of boyfriends. She was now living with a man who was separated from his wife—a terribly sordid life. He wanted to have her as his mistress. He placed his children first, his wife second, his mistress third. And she didn’t have any response at all.

The man was a wealthy man. He gave the woman a lot of things she liked. And she said, “I’m just plain cold. I have no feelings. It’s a mechanical thing for me.”

In a trance, I explained to her about how boys learn to recognize different feelings in their penis—when it’s limp, a quarter erect, halfway erect, fully erect. How it feels when detumescence occurs. How it feels when the ejaculation occurs. And I explained to her all about wet dreams in boys.

I said, “In every boy half of his ancestors are feminine. And what any boy can do, any girl can do. And so you can have a wet dream at night. In fact, you can have a wet dream any time you wish. In the daytime you may see a handsome man. Why not have one then? He doesn’t need to know about it. But you can know about it.”

She said, “That’s an intriguing thought.”

I noticed that she became abnormally still. Her face flushed.

She said, “Dr. Erickson, you’ve just given me my first orgasm. Thank you very much.”

I’ve received several letters from her. She’s gotten rid of the boyfriend who separated from his wife. She’s with a young man her age who’s interested in marriage. And sex with him is absolutely wonderful. She has an orgasm or two or three every time.

Regarding that buildup about all boys having wet dreams, the reason for it is that a person learns to masturbate using his hands. In order to mature he must function sexually without the use of his hands. So his unconscious mind furnishes him, in his dreams, with a sex object.

Why did I describe boys’ masturbation and not girls’? Because I could describe a boy and not be talking about her, and she could understand. And then, when she understood, I said, “A girl can have wet dreams too. And half of every boy’s ancestors are female.”




Erickson points out, apparently irrelevantly, “In every boy, half of his ancestors are feminine.” He is simply telling this patient that she can learn from the experience that he has described for a boy.

We note not only that the patient’s sexual unresponsiveness has been cured, but also that there was a carryover effect into her life, as manifested by her choosing a more appropriate partner. So much for the minimizing of hypnosis as “just symptom cure!”

This story is another good example of the use of indirect suggestion to bring about symptom cure.
