title: DO YOU HEAR IT?
---




A woman volunteered at a workshop to be a subject. She said that many people had worked with her for hours, but the suggestions had no effect.

So I quizzed her a little bit about herself. She was French. She named her favorite French food, told me about a French restaurant in New Orleans that she liked, and told me how much she enjoyed music. She described the music.

When she saw my listening attitude, she turned her head and started listening with the other ear. She was left-eared. So I closed my right ear.

I said, “Do you hear it too? Is it very faint? I wonder how far away that orchestra is. It seems to be coming closer.”

And pretty soon she found herself unable to keep from beating time to the music.

Then I raised the question, “Are there one or two violinists in the orchestra?” There were two. She pointed out the man who played the saxophone. And, so, we had a good time.

I wondered if the orchestra had reached the end of that piece of music and whether they opened their music notes for another type of music to play. She heard all her favorite tunes played.

Hypnosis is best accomplished by thinking about certain phenomena. You listen to a stutterer talk, and you can’t resist forming the words yourself. You form the words yourself, to help him out.




This is a much more elegant way of suggesting auditory hallucinations than the usual one, in which the hypnotist will say, “You will hear…” Erickson is pointing out, again, the human tendency to want to help another person. Thus, when he shows himself almost able to hear the orchestra, his patient helps him by hearing it herself.
