title: ORANGES

One patient went to a drugstore with a prescription for one dose of castor oil. When she handed the druggist her prescription, she told him castor oil made her very sick. When she got home, she’d have to take the castor oil and get sick to her stomach.

So the druggist said, “While I’m preparing your dose of castor oil, would you like a glass of fresh orange juice?”

She noticed that the fresh orange juice tasted somewhat differently. After she finished her glass, she said, “Now, for my prescription?”

The druggist said, “You’ve already taken it, in the orange juice.”

Within a few days she noticed a billboard advertising Sunkist oranges; she got very sick to her stomach. She went into a restaurant, saw some oranges, and got sick to her stomach. She couldn’t go shopping for her mother if there were oranges in the store. And she had to discard a lot of her clothing that was orange in color. It got so that when she even heard the word “orange,” she got very sick to her stomach, and that led to a severe headache.

I arranged that she be invited to a party at the hospital, as she was a friend of one of the doctors on the staff. I arranged things with that doctor friend. Subsequently, at the party, he demanded that I demonstrate hypnosis, so I hypnotized first this person, then that one. Finally, she volunteered as a hypnotic subject.

In the trance state I regressed her to the age of three years, long before the castor-oil episode. She was in a deep somnambulistic trance, having negative and positive hallucinations. The host asked everybody if they would like some orange juice. And everybody did want orange juice. So he brought in a basketful of oranges, squeezed them, and sat down beside the girl. We chatted about this topic and that. I had her see him, talk to him. And we all drank orange juice. Later I had her awaken with an undefinable taste in her mouth, but a good taste. As she went home that night she passed the billboard and said, “That’s funny, that billboard doesn’t make me sick any more.”

And thereafter she drank orange juice and wore her orange dresses. Later, she recalled, “I can’t remember just when the sight of oranges made me sick, but it doesn’t any more. I wonder why it was? I can’t remember when it was.”

Just reorienting a person in time did that. If you were afraid of heights and you couldn’t climb Squaw Peak, what would I do? I would disorient you in time, even if I have to go back ten or twelve years. You’d go out for a walk as if you were eighteen years younger, when you might not have had that phobia. So you’d climb that mountain, to see what’s on the other side.

Or, if I couldn’t do that with you, I would disorient your perception of things so that the mountain would look like flat land, a flat piece of land, like fresh sod that you can plough freshly. It is rough walking. You’d climb the mountain, and blame it on the plowing. It would get you over the mountain. Then I’d have you slowly recover your orientation.

On a warm summer’s day, in your sleep, you can go skating on ice. And you can dine in New Orleans, San Francisco, or Honolulu. You can fly a plane, drive a car, meet all kinds of friends, and yet you’re still sound asleep in bed.

You realize that every patient has had that sort of experience, so, in a trance state, you can suggest that a dream can turn into a feeling of hypnotic reality. A trance only allows you to handle all the learning you have already acquired. And we often disregard the learnings that we have acquired.
