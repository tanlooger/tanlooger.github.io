title: PRETEND A TRANCE
---




Putting Dolly into a trance was quite a bit of labor. She just couldn’t go deeply into a trance. I gave her a suggestion to the effect that she could “learn to go into a trance.”

Then I told her about the experience of a hypnotic subject in Albuquerque. A professor had been working with her, on some hypnotic experimentation, and he had told me, “We tried and tried to have her go into a deep trance and she simply can’t.”

So I had the subject essentially make believe she was going into a trance. I told her to open her eyes and just be able to see my hand. Then I told her that her peripheral vision would close down and down, until it was limited to my hand. And there are four other sensory areas. And pretty soon she felt sure that she could see only my hand, without the desk, or me, or the chair. Then I had her come out and go into her light trance, then repeat going into a deep trance. She repeatedly simulated a deep trance until it actually became real.

Dolly listened to that story. She simulated a deep trance—until it became real.




On occasion, members of an audience who heard Erickson tell this tale would, themselves, go into a deep trance. I have indicated some of the “marked” phrases. Here, Erickson changed his tone of voice and slowed down. These phrases were then responded to as if they were direct suggestions—such as “You will see only my hand.”

With patients who have difficulty in going into a trance, I often quote recent research that indicates that people who simulate a hypnotic trance will achieve the same results as those who are “actually” in a trance. As we can see in this tale, one can simulate a light trance or a deep one. Erickson gives guidance by describing some of the phenomena of a deep trance—such as “negative hallucinations” (not being able to see the desk, the rest of his body, or the chair).
