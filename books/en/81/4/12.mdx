title: KATHLEEN: TREATMENT OF A PHOBIA
---




In the following complete transcript, we can, fortunately, observe an entire therapy demonstrating indirect suggestion. We can see the ways in which Erickson seeds ideas and comes back to them later. We can observe his utilization of long-term posthypnotic suggestion and reframing.

The subject of this verbatim account, Kathleen, was a student in one of Erickson’s teaching seminars. It is not possible for us to determine how Erickson discovered that she was suffering with a vomiting phobia. He simply explains, when asked, that “In this world there are always a number of tattletales.” Perhaps another student had told him. Or perhaps he deduced it. In any case, he was not hesitant in proffering treatment, and it was accepted.




E: You realize you’re in a trance, don’t you? You can realize it better if you close your eyes.

Now, in that trance, I want you to feel so comfortable. I want you to go into trance so deeply that it will seem to you as if you are a bodyless mind, that your mind is floating in space, free of your body, floating in space and floating in time.

And I want you to choose some time in the past when you were a very, very little girl. And my voice will go with you. And my voice will change into that of your parents, your neighbors, your friends, your schoolmates, your playmates, your teachers. And I want you to find yourself sitting in the schoolroom, a little girl feeling very happy about something, something that happened a long time ago, that you forgot a long time ago.

And there’s one other experience I want you to have. And when I tell you to wake up, to wake up from the neck up. Your body will remain sound asleep. Now, it will be hard to awaken from the neck up, but you can do it.

Now, soon you’ll begin awakening from the neck up. Now, don’t be scared, because your body is sound asleep. Take all the time necessary to wake up from the neck up. It’s hard work, but you can do it.

(long pause)

Now your head is beginning to wake up. Your eyes are beginning to open, (pause) You can do it. And maybe your body, still sound asleep, will be that of a little girl. You are slowly awakening from the neck up. Your eyes are beginning to flutter open. As you lift your head, your neck unfreezes. (pause)

Lift the head and see me.

Is your head awake?

You know that in this world, there are many adaptations to life. I would hate to go for a swim in the Arctic Ocean, but the walrus enjoys it; the whale enjoys it. I think the Antarctic is cold. I’d hate to be a penguin hatching an egg at sixty below zero, holding that egg between my feet, and starving for six weeks until my fat spouse came back from the ocean and took her turn hatching the egg.

And, you know, the whales, such large mammals, live on plankton, microscopic particles in the ocean water. And I wonder how many tons of sea water pass through the mouth before they get enough plankton. Because, you know, I’m glad the whale can eat plankton and grow large and fat. And the famous scuba divers of Australia enjoy riding on the back of the leopard shark as it swims lazily about, passing seawater over its gills for oxygen, and combing its gills for plankton to nourish its huge body.

Do you have any objection to whales and sharks living that way? And then I watched an education program of a woodpecker in the Black Forest, made by a bird-watcher. The woodpecker spent about three weeks chipping out a hole big enough and deep enough to rear a family in. The bird-watcher, in the absence of the parents on feeding trips, bored a hole in the nest and pushed away the wood, and put a pane of glass into place so the woodpecker’s hole was a complete hole, solid and impenetrable. Then the bird-watcher fixed up an electric light so when the eggs hatched, their rate of growth could be filmed. Finally, he fitted a ring around the neck of the young woodpecker, and during the absence of the parent, he emptied out the throat of the baby woodpecker to see what kind of food it was living on. In that way he discovered that the woodpecker is vital to the preservation of the forest. He found leaf-eating beetles and wood-eating beetles that destroy the bark and leaves of the tree.

Of course, the parents go out to locate the beetles; they have puffs in their necks in which they predigest those hard beetles. And when they get back to the nest, they regurgitate the half-digested beetles into the gaping mouths of the nestlings.

I think nursing, from my experience, is a much better way of getting food. If I were a woodpecker’s baby, I’d much prefer the regurgitated beetles, already predigested. And so, human beings are the highest of all animals in development, but all these learnings so peculiar to other animals yet have their counterparts in human life. We use regurgitation to save life. Woodpeckers use regurgitation to save life. Human beings swallow things instantly only to have their stomach say, “You pitiful fool, get rid of this, now, and by the shortest route possible.” Isn’t that right?

And I think it’s wonderful that human beings have stomachs without brains and yet have enough intelligence to say, “Get rid of this rubbish, in the quickest route possible.”

Now, all these things in human living are very, very important and should be admired.

Now, do you think you’re ever going to be afraid of vomiting again? No need to be. It’s nice you don’t have to depend on brains in your head. And you could say the reaction is often much more intelligent than mental reactions.

So, would you like to tell us how you used to be afraid of vomiting?

Kathleen: How did you know that?

E: In this world there are always a number of tattletales. Do you know when you developed your vomiting phobia?

K: A long time ago.

E: Do you know the phrase “ontogeny repeats philogeny”? The growth of the individual repeats the growth of the species. Though you might breathe through your nose, anatomically there are gill slits. How does it feel to be wide awake? How large is your body? Doesn’t it amaze you that you can’t use it? No, you can’t stand up.

K: What can’t I do?”

E: You can’t stand up.

K: Are you sure?

E: Oh, I’m sure, but are you?

K: Well, I was till a minute ago; I think I can.

E: Practically everybody here knows they can. You only think you can.

K: Well, I know I could until a minute ago. I’ve always had a great fear of not being able to move, or being crippled like my mother.

E: What crippled her?

K: For years I thought it was polio, but then I found out it was her mind. She had polio, but it was her mind.

E: Mine is really polio, plus wear and tear of age. Someday, like the one-hoss shay, I’m going to fall apart. I intend to stick around until that day, though.

You know, when I was a little child I visited my grandmother’s brother and his family. They were shearing sheep. I heard the sheep bleating. I ran away because I couldn’t understand shearing the sheep. My Aunt Mary served fried liver, and for years I wouldn’t eat liver because I thought of those sheep’s ears. Now, with my gout, I can’t eat all the liver I’d like to.

Close your eyes, and wake up all over now. All over.

Wake up all over. And free. And try to keep the smile off your face.

Now, what do you think about vomiting?

It’s like when you have too many cans of soda pop; when you’ve gotta go, you’ve gotta go.

K: Do you have a secret stable of tattletales?

E: Your friend came in this morning and said you had a bad dream, remembering only the affects. That told me you have a phobia. One of my tattletales named the phobia. Aren’t you glad there are tattletales? Do you believe in reincarnation?

K: I’m going to come back as a French horn.

E: I think you have to tip it over and drain it.

K: You know, all my life I’ve been coming back as a French horn without knowing that! I get the picture now; all I had was the sound before!

E: Let this be a lesson to you: all your brains are not located in your cranium. You know what Shakespeare says: “The stages of life really start with the infant.”

Now I think you ought to have a good start in life.

And in Corinthians it says: “When I was a child, I spoke as a child. I did as a child. And now I have become a man I put aside childish things.” And that includes fears, right?

What is your first name?”

K: Kathy.

E: Shall I officially change it for you? From now on, it shall be only Kathleen, not fraidy-cat, puking Kathy.

How do you feel?

K: Somewhere between spacey and peaceful.

E: There’s an old Irish song; I don’t want to call my wife out to quote it. I never quote exactly correctly. I wanted to introduce Margaret Mead saying I couldn’t quote poetry correctly. But I have no difficulty introducing Dr. Margaret Mead. And the one other thing I was sure of: I could quote Gertrude Epstein’s “A Rose is a Rose is a Rose is a Rose.” Only to find out later from my family, who enjoyed it, that Gertrude Stein’s name didn’t have an “Ep,” and that there are only three roses!

Now, the thing I have in mind is “Down went McGinty to the bottom of the sea.” If the sea was Irish whiskey, he swore he’d never come up again. If the sea was dry, he wouldn’t waste one drop of the sea by vomiting it!

And Kathleen is a good Irish name!

Now you have witnessed a demonstration of psychotherapy. I was not the least bit dignified. I laughed and I joked. I may have bored the life out of some of you by talking about whales and plankton and so on. Woodpeckers and beetles.




The above transcript is so rich in examples of indirect suggestion and use of symbolic language that it would take an entire book to discuss these aspects. Readers may enjoy discovering some of them for themselves.

By a roundabout route, starting with all types of different animals and their adaptation, Erickson introduces the idea that vomiting is a lifesaving adaptive reaction in human beings. He talks about the “gut reaction” as being valuable. He introduces his optimistic philosophy of life to counter the patient’s fear of becoming crippled, “like my mother.” He says, “Someday, like the one-hoss shay, I am going to fall apart. I intend to stick around until that day, though.” He drives home and validates her cure by reference to the “infant” of Shakespeare, and he leaves out the end of the quotation so that the patient herself can supply it. (“First the infant, mewling and puking in his mother’s arms.”) To make sure she gets the message, he refers to the passage from Corinthians that says, “…and now that I have become a man, I have put aside childish things.” He adds, “And that includes fears, right?” To change her attitudes toward herself, he even changes her name to Kathleen, so that she can leave behind her previous attitude toward herself, which includes her being “a fraidy-cat, puking Kathy.” He concludes with “Now you have witnessed a demonstration in psychotherapy.” And an elegant demonstration it was!

Erickson utilizes every production or comment of the patient toward his therapeutic goal—in this case, to change her attitude about vomiting. For example, when she says that she would like to be reincarnated as a French horn, he immediately responds by saying, “I think you have to tip it over and drain it.” In other words, she has to be prepared to empty out whatever fluids have accumulated in her. She has to be ready to vomit. Kathleen signifies her recognition of this suggestion by saying, “All I had was the sound before.” She is saying that there is some substance that can be brought up from inside her.

When Erickson utilizes quotations from Shakespeare and the Bible, he is relating to his patient as if she were a young student, open to learning. He seeded this idea in the initial hypnotic suggestion when he said, “And I want you to find yourself sitting in the schoolroom.” In this case, Erickson takes a rather scattershot approach. He can’t be certain which set of suggestions or which way of reframing the problem would be utilized by the patient, so he seems to hit her from all sides.

There is no escaping his suggestions of health. He even lifts her out of her mess, when he gives her a new name, a new identity. Her new name will be associated in an almost Pavlovian way with the change. Erickson used this approach, giving people new names or allowing them to give themselves new names, long before this practice became popular in the encounter groups of the sixties. The new name becomes a posthypnotic cue so that every time she uses it or hears it, new associations of mastery or self-respect will be revivified. This approach is much more aesthetically pleasing, naturalistic, and geared to the individual than is, for example, biofeedback treatment, wherein cues are mechanistically introduced. For example, in one treatment of hypertension by means of biofeedback, patients were conditioned to have their blood pressure lowered every time they looked at a red dot on their watches. Erickson’s cue—in this case the name Kathleen—is beautifully woven in with all of the other cues and suggestions. Jeffrey Zeig’s comment was “He gave this woman a forced feeding. He gave her an ingestion of new material that she would have to incorporate, and that she could not regurgitate.” And wasn’t it aesthetically and tastefully presented?
