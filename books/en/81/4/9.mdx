title: SKIN CONDITIONS
---




A woman doctor from the East called me up and said, “My son’s a student at Harvard and he has an extremely bad case of acne. Can you treat that with hypnosis?”

I said, “Yes. Why bother bringing him to me? How are you going to spend Christmas vacation?”

She said, “I usually take a vacation from medical practice and go to Sun Valley and ski.”

I said, “Well, this Christmas vacation, why don’t you take your son with you? Find a cabin and remove all mirrors in it. You can eat your meals in that cabin, and be sure that you keep your hand mirror in the safety pocket of your purse.”

They spent the time skiing and the son couldn’t see a mirror. His acne cleared up in two weeks’ time.

Now, acne can be cured by removing all mirrors. Rashes on the face or eczema often disappear in the same way.

Another patient, a woman with warts on both hands, deforming warts, came to see me. Her face was also a mess of warts. She said she wanted to get rid of them by hypnosis. If you know anything about medicine, you know that warts are caused by a virus and also that warts are very susceptible to changes in blood pressure.

I told the woman to soak her feet, first in ice-cold water, then in water as hot as she could stand, and then in ice-cold water again. She was to do that three times a day, until she was so annoyed that she’d give anything not to have to do it. When she had lost her warts she could forget about soaking her feet.

Now, it would be an annoying thing for her to have to interrupt the day’s procedures to soak her feet and to keep this up in a scheduled manner.

Some three years later, this woman brought her son to me. I asked her about her warts. She said, “What warts?”

I said, “You came to see me, about three years ago, for the treatment of warts on your hands and face.”

She said, “You must be mistaking me for another person.” She had obeyed my suggestion. She had soaked her feet some months, as her husband confirmed. Then she got so disgusted by it, she forgot about soaking her feet, thereby forgetting about her warts. Since she was no longer worrying about her warts, their blood supply was cut down by the blood drawn to her feet and by her lack of attention to them. So she lost them all.




In the treatment of skin conditions by changing a person’s focus of attention, Erickson is illustrating the dictum that Paracelsus expounded in the fifteenth century: “As man imagines himself to be, so shall he be, and he is that which he imagines.” There really are physical effects associated with mental imagery. These effects can be attained inside of the body also, but they simply are more demonstrable on the skin. The most obvious examples are blushing when we think about an embarrassing situation, or the development of an erection when we fantasize an erotic image. A person who imagines himself as worthy holds himself erect and moves decisively and confidently. Is it, then, surprising that his skeletal structure, muscle tone, and facial expression develop quite differently from those of someone who “imagines” or images himself to be a nonentity?
