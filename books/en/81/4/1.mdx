title: THE HYPNOTIC SUBJECT IS LITERAL
---




I had a girl over for a demonstration of deep trance and trance phenomena for Dr. Ernest Rossi. I told her to go into a deep trance and to meet me in the middle of nowhere. She promptly opened her eyes, in the trance state, and said, very earnestly, “There is something awfully wrong!”

Dr. Rossi did not know what was wrong—but she knew what was wrong. Now, what’s wrong about meeting me in the middle of nowhere?

There is no middle of nowhere! It’s vacant space.

I had her close her eyes and I awakened her from the trance, and then I said, “I want you to do another task for me. I want you to meet me in outer space after going into a trance.”

She opened her eyes in a trance state. It was obvious that she was not oriented to the room, the floor, or anything. Then I told her, “See this paperweight in my hand. Now, put that paperweight into a different position.”

What did she do? She said, “Dr. Erickson, there are only three positions. I am in one, you are in one, the paperweight is in the third. Those are the only positions.”

The hypnotic subject listens very literally.

I had her awaken again and I told her a shaggy-dog joke. “The cowboy was out riding one day and he came to a mountain, so high that it took him two looks to see to the top. He looked upwards as far as he could. Then he took a second look beginning where the first look left off.” I put her into a trance and told her, “When you open your eyes I want you to see my hands, but not beyond them. Now lean forward and look.”

She said, “Pink and gray. Those are your hands, Dr. Erickson, but where are you? I see your hands but you do not have any wrists. And, Dr. Erickson, there is something awfully wrong that I am seeing. Your hands are two-dimensional and I know they should be three-dimensional.”

Now, when we deal with hypnosis, bear in mind that the unconscious places very specific meanings upon words. All your lives you have been learning things, transferring that knowledge to your unconscious and using, automatically, the end results of the learning. You learned to talk and there was a time when you thought “dink-a-wa-wa” was a drink of water. It took you a long time to discover that “dink-a-wa-wa” is not a drink of water; and that is why it takes a long time for patients, as adults, to understand, after you explain very carefully that “there is a language you don’t understand—although you once did.”




At the same time that Erickson is pointing up the fact that a hypnotic subject responds literally to suggestions, he is emphasizing that unconscious learnings do not remain fixed, but are added to with new learning. “All your lives you have been learning things, transferring them to your unconscious, and using, automatically, the end results of the learning.” He is suggesting that you, the reader, will transfer to your unconscious mind the learnings derived from his teaching tales and you will use the end result automatically.
