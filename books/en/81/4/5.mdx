title: COMPETITION
---




I had a patient come in from Philadelphia. A doctor brought him. I looked at that patient and I know that never before had I seen a man who was so competitive in nature. He would compete with you on anything and he had a very competitive business. He watched for every possible chance to compete.

I told him, “You have headaches, migraine headaches, that simply are killing you day after day. You’ve had them for nine years. You’ve been in daily treatment for your headaches for three years, with this doctor whom you trust. And you have made no progress at all. Now he has brought you out here, for me to work with you. And I’m not going to work with you, but I will do this. You put your hands on your knees and see whether your left hand will rise up to your face first or your right hand first.”

And the competition that developed between his two hands—it was marvelous! It took about a half an hour for one hand to win.

Just when his hand was touching his face, I said, “The tension is in the muscles and you hold that tension in your hands while they are competing.” It wasn’t pleasant for him to feel that tension. “Now, if you want to have headaches, why not have a headache free of muscle competition of the muscles in your neck and shoulders? I don’t think you want a headache any more than you want competition in your neck and shoulder muscles. I’d like to have you know what muscle relaxation is by letting your hands compete in relaxing.”

So I gave him a lesson in tension and relaxation. And he’s been free of headaches ever since. That was at least six or eight years ago.




Here Erickson illustrates the principle of meeting the patient in the patient’s own frame of reference. He utilized the patient’s competitive tendency and finally helped transfer this competitiveness into a more constructive direction. Of course, any competitiveness with Erickson was redirected toward the patient’s inner competitiveness. Subsequently there was no resistance toward hypnosis or to the therapeutic suggestions that Erickson presented.
