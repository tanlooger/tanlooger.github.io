title: “AUTO”-HYPNOSIS
---




One patient said to me, “I’m very neurotic, but I can’t talk to you or anybody else. I know you through some friends of mine who are your patients. And I haven’t got the nerve to tell you what my problem is. Now will you be my therapist?”

I said, “Yes, in any way I can.”

She said, “Well, the way I’m going to do it is this. In the evening, around eleven o’clock, I’ll drive over and park in your driveway and imagine you’re in the car with me. Then I’ll think through my problem.”

She paid for two consultations. I don’t know how many times she spent the night, until about 4 A.M., in my driveway working on her problem. She worked out her problem and only paid me for the first two consultations.

She told me, “I’m over my problem. Now if you want me to, I’ll work on experimental work with you.” And Linn Cooper [co-author with Erickson of Time Distortion in Hypnosis] and I used her in time-distortion experiments with hypnosis. So, in actuality, she really paid, in time services. And I suggested she use the trance, when Linn Cooper and I worked on time distortion, to her own advantage. Linn Cooper and I were satisfied. We were getting what we wanted. I think she got all she wanted.




In this case we have a literal example of Erickson’s dictum “It’s the patient who does the therapy.” Still, this patient needed to know that Erickson was her therapist. She obviously could not treat herself without a therapist. Perhaps this need for another person, a therapist—if only in fantasy—confirms Martin Buber’s teaching that only in relationship with other people can we be fulfilled and enabled to grow.
