title: SCRATCHING HOGS
---




One summer I sold books to pay my way through college. I walked into a farmyard about five o’clock, interviewed the farmer about buying books, and he said, “Young fellow, I don’t read anything. I don’t need to read anything. I’m just interested in my hogs.”

“While you’re busy feeding the hogs, do you mind if I stand and talk to you?” I asked.

He said, “No, talk away, young fellow, it won’t do you a bit of good. I’m not going to pay attention to you; I am busy feeding the hogs.”

And so I talked about my books. Being a farm boy, I thoughtlessly picked up a pair of shingles lying on the ground and started scratching the hogs’ backs as I was talking. The farmer looked over, stopped, and said, “Anybody knows how to scratch a hog’s back, the way hogs like it, is somebody I want to know. How about having supper with me tonight and you can sleep overnight with no charge and I will buy your books. You like hogs. You know how to scratch ’em the way they liked to be scratched.”




Here, Erickson is recounting how he had unconsciously acted in precisely the best way to achieve his purpose—in this case, to sell books. He emphasizes the fact that he had “thoughtlessly” picked up some shingles and had scratched the hog’s back as he was talking to the farmer. The farmer unconsciously responded to a man whom he felt to be a kindred soul.

Of course, Erickson is not teaching a way to sell books, or to manipulate people. He genuinely was able to relate to this farmer, partly because he too was a farm boy. The action that was effective—the scratching of the hog’s back—could be expressed because Erickson was free in expressing himself. He is urging the listener to trust his own unconscious as he had trusted his unconscious and as the farmer had trusted his own unconscious in responding to the young Erickson.

This story also illustrates the principle that I have designated as “Join the Patient.”

Erickson told me this story in August 1979, after I asked him why he chose me to write the Foreword to his book Hypnotherapy. Before he began his tale about scratching hogs he had answered, “I liked you and you gave a gold frog to my wife.” (When I had first visited Erickson, in 1970, I was returning from Los Angeles to New York with a collection of live snakes, geckos, and frogs. I had given him a beautiful yellow frog as a gift.)

He elaborated, “You made a good impression on me. I liked you. You are genuine. You are honest. You are thoughtful. You are intelligent and you were willing to go from New York to San Francisco or L.A. just because you liked frogs! My impression in this room is—the guy likes carvings. That should be your impression of me. That guy really likes carvings. And there is more to him than sitting in a chair making dollars as a psychoanalyst. He’s got other interests. And frogs are a far step from psychoanalysis and psychiatry, literature, and so on. You’ve got a wide breadth there.”

At the conclusion of his tale he underlined his point by looking directly at me with his clearest and kindliest gaze and commenting, “I like the way you scratch a hog.” He made it clear that he trusted his unconscious in his selection of collaborators, just as he did in other decisions.
