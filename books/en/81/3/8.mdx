title: PROFESSOR RODRIGUEZ
---




I go into trances so that I will be more sensitive to the intonations and inflections of my patients’ speech. And to enable me to hear better, see better. I go into a trance and forget the presence of others. And people see me in a trance.

There was a patient, Rodriguez, a professor of psychiatry from Peru. He wrote that he wanted psychotherapy from me. I knew him by reputation. I knew that he was far better educated than I was. I knew that he was quicker witted than I was. I regarded him as much more intelligent than I. And here he was, asking to come to be my patient.

I wondered, “How can I handle a man who is brighter, better educated, quicker witted than I am?” He was Castilian Spanish, and extremely arrogant—arrogant and ruthless, very insulting to deal with. I gave him a two o’clock appointment. I took down his name, address, his local address, his marital status, all the statistics. Then I looked up to ask him, “How do you see your problem?” The chair was empty.

I looked at the clock. It was not around two o’clock. It was four o’clock. I noticed that I had a manila folder with sheets of paper inside. So I realized that I had gone into a hypnotic trance to interview him.

Then one day after twelve or fourteen hours of therapy, Rodriguez jumped to his feet and said, “Dr. Erickson, you’re in a trance!”

I awakened and said, “I know you’re brighter than I am and more intelligent, quicker witted, much better educated. And that you are very arrogant. I didn’t feel I could handle you and I wondered how I would handle you. I didn’t know until after the first interview that my unconscious mind decided to take over the job. I know I’ve got sheets, notes, in the folder. I haven’t read them yet. And I will read them, now, after you leave.”

Rodriguez looked at me angrily and said (pointing to a photograph), “Are those your parents?”

I said, “Yes.”

He said, “Your father’s occupation?”

I said, “He’s a retired farmer.”

And Rodriguez said, scornfully, “Peasants!”

Now I knew that he knew a lot of history. I said, “Yes, peasants. And, for all I know, the blood of the bastards of my ancestors runs in your veins.” He knew about the Vikings overrunning all of Europe. He was a good boy after that. Now that took a bit of rapid thinking, to get “the blood of the bastards of my ancestors may run in your veins.”

I knew Rodriguez had left England without paying Ernest Jones his fee for his psychoanalysis. I knew he had left Duke University with a lot of debts behind him. And, as we began the last week, I had Rodriguez give me the names of all the important people he knew. I put down their addresses. He was very pleased to show off that way. I got them all written down and then I said, “Are you going to pay by check or cash?”

He said, “You tricked me.”

I said, “I thought it was necessary. I earned my fee.”

So I got my fee. Why else would I want to know the names and addresses of all his important friends? He knew blackmail when he heard it.




This was one of Erickson’s favorite stories to illustrate the value of trance for a therapist, in order to enable him to find the best ways of responding effectively to his patients. This story requires little comment. It does emphasize the importance of the therapist’s being “one up” when he is dealing with an arrogant patient. Erickson builds up to this by first pointing out the ways in which he was actually inferior to Rodriguez. This makes his having the last word all the more effective. He is giving us a submessage. Even though we may feel “inferior” to another person, even though we may feel inadequate, if we will dig into our unconscious minds we can find resources to equalize situations or bring us to a superior position. We may have to dredge up our ancestors, as Erickson did, but that is all right. Erickson would certainly not deprive us of the assets and resources we have inherited. He believed in using whatever one has—all of one’s resources.
