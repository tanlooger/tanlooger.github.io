title: HE WILL TALK
---




A lot of people were worried because I was four years old and didn’t talk, and I had a sister two years younger than me who talked, and she is still talking but she hasn’t said anything. And many people got distressed because I was a four-year-old boy who couldn’t talk.

My mother said, comfortably, “When the time arrives, then he will talk.”




This last tale highlights Erickson’s belief that the unconscious mind can be trusted to produce appropriate responses at the right time. When this story is told to a patient who is just beginning to experience hypnotic trance, it may encourage him to wait patiently until the urge to talk arises or until he is able to reveal unconscious messages in a nonverbal way.
