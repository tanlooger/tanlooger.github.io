title: LIGHT SNOW
---




In the village of Lowell, Wisconsin, it snowed for the first time that autumn on November 12, shortly before 4:00 P.M. And that kid in the third seat, in the third row of seats, right beside the window, wondered, How long will I remember this?

I was just wondering….

I knew exactly…I knew it was November 12, in the year 1912. It was a very light snow.
