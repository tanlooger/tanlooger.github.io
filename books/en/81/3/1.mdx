title: I’D LEARNED MUCH
---




At Oswego College in New York, Estabrooks [a professor of psychiatry] said, when I went up to him, “I’ll schedule you to give a convocation for teachers this evening.” There would be a lot of townspeople attending and I had a lot of things to do before I went to the auditorium, unrelated to the lecture. I was not concerned, however, because I knew I could talk and I knew I could think and I knew that I’d learned much in the course of the years.




In the above vignette, and the two that follow, Erickson models an attitude of trust in one’s long-term memories and in unconsciously stored knowledge. He underlines the fact that the unconscious mind is a repository of memories and skills that can be called upon after many years. He was fond of quoting Will Rogers, “It ain’t what we don’t know that gives us trouble. It’s what we know that ain’t so that gives us trouble.” To which Erickson would add, “The things that we know, but don’t know we know, give us even more trouble.”
