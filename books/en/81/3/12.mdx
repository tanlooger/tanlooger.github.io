title: TRANCES IN BALI
---




When Margaret Mead, Jane Belo, and Gregory Bateson went to Bali in 1937, they went for the purpose of studying autohypnosis in the Balinese culture. In the Balinese culture, you could be going to a market. On the way to the market the Balinese can go into a deep trance, do their shopping, turn around, and come out of the trance when they get homeâ€”or stay in the trance and visit with a neighbor who is not in a trance, while they are in a trance. Autohypnosis is part of their daily life. Mead, Bateson, and Belo studied their behavior and brought back movies for me to examine. Dr. Mead wanted to know if a Balinese trance and the trance of the Occident were the same. Now, she [Lucy, a student] made the body-orientation movements that the Balinese people do, closing her hands, wanting to stand on her toes, getting reacquainted with the body. It is characteristic of a trance.




This story demonstrates that it is possible to carry out ordinary activities, such as shopping and visiting with neighbors, while one is in a trance state. It is not necessary to carry out unusual behavior. At the end of the story, Erickson relates the Balinese trance experience to that in the West by pointing out that the body-orientation movements of a therapist (Lucy) in his office are similar to those of the Balinese people when they come out of a trance. With this example, which is set in a distant and, for most of us, exotic place, Erickson is conveying two messages. The first is that trance is a rather ordinary experience, experienced by all of us. The second is that trance is somewhat exotic and glamorous.
