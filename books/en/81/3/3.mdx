title: NARWHAL
---




On the farm we had two books—the history of the United States and an unabridged dictionary. I read that dictionary from A to Z, repeatedly. And I had a tremendous vocabulary. Much later, while I was lecturing in Montana, a doctor invited me to spend an evening at his home. During the course of the evening he brought out a very peculiar spiral-shaped object and asked, “Do you know what that is?”

I said, “Yes, it’s a narwhal tusk.”

He said, “You’re the first person who has even looked at that and recognized it. My grandfather was a whaler and he got this tusk from a narwhal. It has been in the family. And I have always been very quiet about it. I let people examine it and wonder and wonder and wonder. Now, how did you know it was a narwhal tusk?”

I said, “When I was five or six years old, I saw a picture of it in an unabridged dictionary.”
