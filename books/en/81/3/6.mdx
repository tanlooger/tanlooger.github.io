title: SEVEN ASTERISKS
---




One of my subjects was a most excellent person with whom I did a lot of experimental work. He was a psychologist. He had a master’s degree and he was really undecided about his future. We used him experimentally and he became aware that he had an unconscious mind. I loaned him my medical books and he entered medical school. In his senior year, one of his professors, who liked him very much, said, “Arthur, how do you think you will get along in my examination?” And Arthur replied, “I won’t have any trouble with your examination. You have only got ten questions and they are—.” And he proceeded to name all ten questions.

The professor said, “Well, you know exactly the questions I’m going to ask! You have even told them to me in the order that I have got those questions. Did you break in to my office and get hold of the carbon copy?”

Arthur said, “No, I just knew what you would ask on a final examination.”

The professor said, “That’s not good enough for me. I’m going to take you in to talk to the dean.”

The dean listened to the story. He said, “Is that true, Arthur? Do you know the questions?”

Arthur said, “Of course I know the questions. I attended his course and I listened to his lectures.”

And the dean said, “In some way you must have gotten hold of the mimeographed sheet. Unless you can prove otherwise, I will have to bar you from taking the examination, and you are not going to graduate, because of dishonesty.”

Arthur said, “You want proof that I knew, before the professor did, what his questions were going to be. You could send someone to my room and get my notebook with the notes I took on his lectures. And you will notice that I have certain things marked with asterisks. All the questions that the professor is going to ask are marked with seven asterisks. You will see that ‘1’ and ‘2’ and ‘3’ are variously applied to those ‘asterisk questions.’ Because he has a habit of asking only ten questions, I selected ten notes that I gave seven asterisks to, because those were the things he gave most emphasis to—both throughout the year and during the summary session at the end of the year.”

Now, they sent someone to get that notebook and found that Arthur had marked some notes with one asterisk, some with two, some with three, some with four, some with five, some with six—and that there were only ten marked with seven asterisks. And the asterisks were numbered, not serially, from 1 to 10. The middle one was 1 and maybe the top one was 9 and so on.

Then the dean said, “You don’t have to take the examination. You really listened and you heard the special intonation that the lecturer gave to those particular points.”

When you listen to a lecturer, and you pay attention to the emphasis that he gives various topics, you can pick out the things that he is going to include in his examination. Arthur was remarkable; he had a remarkable sense of hearing and a remarkable sense of pitch, so he always knew in advance what topic would be included in the examination. The teacher would give it away. They tell you what is most important and they always want the importance to be recognized by the students. Now, sometimes they think a point that is not really important is important. Be careful to remember that point, because that will be included in the examination. Communication is a very complicated thing. Our facial expression, our eyes, the way we hold our bodies, the way we move our bodies and our extremities, the way we move our heads and so on, the way we move certain individual muscles—all this discloses a lot of information.




In this story the young psychologist-medical student had learned not only to trust his unconscious mind but also to develop his perceptive skills to a rather extreme degree. As Erickson said, “Arthur was remarkable.” Of course, most of us have not developed our perceptual skills to such an extent. Still, if we know that it is possible, we may be encouraged in a similar direction, especially when we receive clear-cut messages in our dreams or in our associations.

The lecturer in this story is unconsciously signaling what he wanted his students to learn. Erickson is telling us to listen to these unconscious cues. In the story, the student was able to translate his unconscious awareness into consciousness. Listeners and readers can respond to Erickson’s subliminal messages even without conscious awareness, however. In fact, he is instructing them to do so.

In the induction and utilization of trance, Erickson encourages us to strive for this same attitude—of trust in our unconscious mind. He does so in the following explanation to therapists:




You see, trance induction should not be a laborious thing. The mere confidence in your own voice. The mere confidence in your ability to induce a trance is the most important thing of all. And anybody who is human is going to get into a trance—even very paranoid patients—if you are very careful. I don’t advise a trance for paranoid patients, because they can become paranoid in the trance state too. But, experimentally, I have determined that all patients can go into a trance state—that anybody can.

Now, is it necessary to know that you are in a trance? No, it isn’t. How deep a trance is necessary? Any trance that is of sufficient level to let your unconscious mind take a look, a mental look, at what’s going on, is sufficient. In those mental looks and understandings, you learn a great deal more than you do by conscious effort. And you should use your mind at the unconscious level, even while you are using it at the conscious level.
