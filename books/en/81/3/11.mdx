title: AUTOMATIC WRITING
---




Every little movement should be regarded. Many times, by writing “yes,” questions can be answered. A girl may ask, “Am I really in love?” and I will ask, “Who do you think you are in love with?”

“Oh, there is Bill, Jim and Pete and George.”

Then I ask, “Is it Bill?”

She writes, “Yes.”

“Is it George?”

“Yes.”

“Is it Jim?”

“Yes.”

“Is it Pete?”

“Yes.”

But if the “yes” causes a hole and the hole is punched in the paper by heaviness of the pencil, that’s really the boy. Yet, she still doesn’t want to know.

Once at Michigan State University, Dr. Anderson gave a lecture on hypnosis to the psychology department—to the entire department. Dr. Anderson asked me if I wanted to demonstrate. I said I had no subject and I would appreciate some volunteers. A number of students were called and asked if they would like to volunteer, and quite a number volunteered. I picked a girl named Peggy. One of the things that Dr. Anderson wanted was automatic writing. I had Peggy go to the far end of a long table; and all the rest of us went to the other end of the table.

I put Peggy into a trance. She was aware that we were sitting at the far end of the long table and that she was at the other end. She wrote something automatically. Then she automatically folded her paper, folded it again, and automatically slipped it into her handbag. She didn’t notice any of that. All the rest of us did. I put her back in a trance and told her that after she awakened, she would automatically write, “It’s a beautiful day in June.” It was April.

She wrote that and after I showed it to her she said that she didn’t write it and that it wasn’t her handwriting. It certainly wasn’t her handwriting.

The following September she called me long distance from Indiana and said, “A funny thing happened today, and I think you’re connected with it—so I’ll tell you what it is. I emptied my handbag today. I found a wad of paper in it. I opened it and on one side was written, in a strange handwriting, ‘Will I marry Harold?’ It wasn’t my handwriting. I don’t know how that paper got into my handbag. And I have a feeling you’re connected with it. And my only connection with you is that lecture you gave in April at Michigan State University. Do you have any explanation of that piece of paper?”

I said, “I lectured at the university in April; that’s true. Now, were you by chance engaged to get married to anybody then?”

“Oh yes, I was engaged to Bill.”

I said, “Did you have any doubts about your engagement then?”

“No, I didn’t.”

“Did you ever develop doubts about your engagement to Bill?”

“Oh, last June, Bill and I broke up.”

“What has happened since then?”

“Oh, in July, I married a man named Harold.”

“How long had you known Harold?”

“Oh, I knew him, by sight, during some part of the second semester but had never met him, never talked to him. I didn’t, till I happened to meet him by chance, in July.”

I said, “That handwriting ‘Will I marry Harold?’ was written by you, automatically, in a trance state. Your unconscious mind already recognized that you were going to break off with Bill and that Harold was the man who really appealed to you.” Her unconscious knew, months in advance, that she would break her engagement. The reason she folded it up was that, consciously, she couldn’t stand facing that fact in April.

With the first automatic handwriting you have a patient do, unless you make it very obvious that they are protected, they will have difficulty in writing freely, because something personal to the self is coming forth and they are not yet ready to face it. So if you want to use automatic writing, let your patient say, “I can’t,” and teach him to let the hand move in a scrawl. Gradually, after a number of scrawls, he will put secret information into a scrawl that can’t be read. Then he will write other things like “This is a beautiful day in June.” Then he can branch out and yield personal information. I once spent sixteen hours deciphering, very slowly, some illegible handwriting that eventually told a whole story—I think that is in “The Collected Papers.”*




The very pressure of handwriting can convey an important message. It was serendipitous that Erickson suggested to Peggy that she write the phrase “It is a beautiful day in June.” June was the month in which she broke up with her fiancé, Bill. And, of course, June is the month we associate with weddings.
