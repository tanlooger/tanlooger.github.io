title: HUEY DUCK, DEWEY DUCK, AND LOUIE DUCK
---




I had a very difficult paragraph to write. I kept trying and trying, ending up in a blind alley. And one day I said, “Well, I have two hours before my next patient comes in. I think I will lean back and go into a trance and see what my unconscious has to say about that difficult paragraph.”

I waited until about fifteen minutes before that patient came in and I was surprised to see, in my lap, a box of comic books belonging to the kids. There were two stacks of comic books on my desk. The patient was due so I put the comic books back in the box, went out into the other room, and saw my patient.

A couple of weeks later I thought, “Well, I haven’t gotten the answer to that paragraph yet.” I had a little time to spare and I took a pencil and something came to my mind immediately: “And Donald Duck said to Huey Duck, Dewey Duck, and Louie Duck…” and I thought with amusement that Donald Duck comic books appealed to the intelligence of the adult as well as the youthful. They have to be succinct, clear, and subtle. So I wrote the paragraph. My unconscious knew where to get an example.




Here is another story that emphasizes the value of the unconscious as a problem solver. Erickson told me this story after I asked him for help in scheduling patients and with writing. Obviously, what he was saying to me was that I ought to go into a trance, giving myself an adequate amount of time, as he had, and that I should then listen to my unconscious mind. Subsequently, I followed this advice and found several solutions. Once, when I experienced a writing block, I entered into a self-hypnotic trance after asking myself, “How could I overcome this block?” I noted a tingling feeling on the inside of my right thumb, on the lateral side of my middle finger, and on the medial side of my index finger. I soon understood that these tingling feelings were located in the exact locations where a pen would make contact. My unconscious message was that I should begin writing by hand, and then switch to dictation. I did this and overcame the writing block.
