title: 11. Treating Psychotic Patients
---






In dealing with psychotics, Erickson did not attempt to solve all of the patient’s problems. As with other patients, he tried to bring about small changes that could lead to larger and broader ones. Since people who are undergoing psychotic reactions usually respond in a “black and white,” extreme manner, Erickson’s interventions with them are often most obvious and the results most immediate. Erickson’s first psychiatric experiences took place in a mental hospital, and he may have developed some of his important principles of therapy from work with psychotic patients. Certainly, this must have been true of two of his favorite maxims, “Speak in the patient’s language,” and “Join the patient.”

In situations where others might have persisted in doggedly attempting to “get a history” or to “reason” with the patient, Erickson often introduced an unexpected element. As we see in “The Patient Who Stood” and “Herbert,” he would often lead the patient to a point where he is forced to take a direct action and make a choice.

In this section, we will see examples of these, as well as of other therapeutic approaches, including the use of effective manipulations and reframing.
