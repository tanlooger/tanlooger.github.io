title: MIND READING
---




At Cornell they were making a big fuss about an idiot savant who would multiply six-digit figures. He could give you the square root, the cube root, of six- and eight-place figures almost instantly. And he had one other trick. He would tell someone to hide a pin anywhere in the building. Then he would walk around with hand contact and he would read that person’s mind, he said.

When they were discussing this at Cornell I suggested, “Why don’t you hide a pin in some building? You don’t need to tell me whether you did it on the second floor, on the first floor, or where, but we’ll hold hands and walk around the campus and I’ll find the pin.”

I found the pin on the second floor, stuck in the frame of a painting. All you do is hold hands, you walk along, and the person withdraws slightly when you get near the pin. So as soon as I found a minimal withdrawal as I approached certain steps, of course I went upstairs. When you reach the top of the stairs there is tension again. Which way to turn? You turn one way and the hands relax. You turn the other way and they tense. So you go around in a circle!
