title: A CARD TRICK
---




One of my hypnotic subjects at Worcester said, “I don’t like to do this trick. It gives me a terrible headache. I think you ought to know about it, though.” He said, “Go into a drugstore and buy a deck of cards. Open it. Take out all the jokers and extra cards.” Then he said, “Shuffle the deck thoroughly, half a dozen times, and cut it and shuffle it again. Deal the cards, face up, one at a time, and then turn them over.” Then he said, “Pick up those cards, shuffle them again and deal them back side up.” And he named the cards in the exact order back side up. He had placed them face up and then turned them over.

Then he showed me. You bought a pack of cards with cross lines and little squares on the back. The squares are not cut truly. He said, “All I had to do was to remember a quarter of a square missing here, a quarter missing there on another card. I just remembered fifty-two cards. And it always has given me a terrible headache—and it took long, hard practice to do it!” He had used that in working his way through school. He had earned a lot of money that way.

It really is amazing what people can do. Only they don’t know what they can do.
