title: SNEEZING

A woman told me, “I’ve seen twenty-six doctors for a physical examination. One of them put me in the hospital for two weeks to run tests on me. Another one kept me in the hospital for a week and ran tests on me. Finally, they told me, ‘You’d better see a psychiatrist, you’re rather slaphappy about having physical examinations.’”

The woman told me that story. I asked her, “What unusual thing did you do during each physical examination that interrupted the doctor’s examination?” She thought a long time before answering, “Well, I always sneezed when they started to examine my right breast.”

I said, “Your age is forty-eight and you always sneeze when they touch your right breast. You told those doctors you had a youthful history of gonorrhea and syphilis and you sneeze when your right breast is touched and they always interrupt their examination of the breast.”

She said, “That’s right.”

I said, “Well, I’m going to send you to a gynecologist and you can listen to what I tell him over the phone.”

I called up the gynecologist and said, “I have a forty-eight-year-old woman in my office. I think she’s got a lump in her right breast. I don’t know whether it’s benign or malignant. There are certain psychological indications. Now, I’m sending the woman to your office, and I want you to give her a thorough examination of that right breast. And, if there’s anything wrong, send her to the hospital directly from your office or she’ll be one of those patients who runs away.”

And he examined her right breast. He took her to the hospital immediately. He operated on her for a malignancy of the breast.




Patients give away the fears that they are trying to hide. Here Erickson is telling therapists to observe not only what we can see, but to look for the things that a patient is trying to hide. As he points out, patients often reveal these things indirectly, by trying to draw attention away from them.

He pointed out to the patient that she was not reticent in talking about her history of venereal disease, yet she drew attention away from her right breast. The implication is that she was terrified of learning that she had breast cancer. Indeed, Erickson feared that her fear of facing her diagnosis (one that she had already made for herself) might also cause her to avoid surgery.
