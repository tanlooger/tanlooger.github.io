title: ABROAD

A new patient was already seated when I arrived. I took her name and address and so on, and I asked why she wanted to see me.

She said, “I have a phobia—about airplanes.”

I said, “Madam, you were sitting in that chair when I arrived in the office. Will you please walk out to the waiting room and return and sit down.” She didn’t like this, but she did so. And I said, “Now, for your problem?”

“My husband is taking me a-broad in September and I have a deathly fear of being on an airplane.”

I said, “Madam, when a patient comes to a psychiatrist there can be no withholding of information. I know something about you. I am going to ask you an unpleasant question. Because patients can’t be helped if they are withholding information. Even if it seems to be unrelated.”

She said, “All right.”

And I said, “Does your husband know about your love affair?”

She said, “No, but how did you?”

I said, “Your body language told me.”

Her ankles were crossed. I can’t do it. Her right leg was crossed over the left one and the foot tucked around the ankle. She was completely locked up. In my experience, every married woman who is having an affair who does not want it known always locks herself up that way.

She said, “A-broad,” not abroad—one word. She paused between “a” and “broad.” She brought her lover in to see me. They had been dating for a number of years. Then she came in to see me about breaking up with him. Her lover came to me because he had a horrible headache, daily. He had some marital problems with his wife and the kids, so I asked to see his wife. I told him I would want to see the children. The wife came in and locked herself up. I said to her, “So you’re having an affair.”

She said, “Yes, did my husband tell you?”

I said, “No, I got it from your body language. Now I know why your husband has a headache.”

She said, “He suggested that I have an affair—some years ago. I found it very pleasant. Then he discovered he didn’t want me to continue. I’m not sure that he suspects I am continuing, but there are times when I think he knows I am.”

Then I asked her husband while he was in a trance about his advising his wife to have an affair. He said, “I was pretty busy at the time and didn’t think I was discharging my husbandly duties. Soon I began to feel jealous and asked her to stop. She said she would, but I keep noticing evidence that says she is continuing the affair—only I don’t want to know that she is.”

I said, “That’s your headache. What do you want to do about it?”

He said, “I’ll have my headache.”

At one time he was the head of the Democratic party in Arizona. He gave up those duties to give more attention to his wife—but it was too late then.

Some people keep pain because they don’t want to know something. So they won’t think about something.




Erickson observes that the patient says the words “a-broad” in a peculiar way. Apparently she is calling herself a “broad” because of her unfaithfulness. He also distinguishes visually that she sits in a particular way.

As with almost all of his tales, Erickson used this one for multiple purposes. At the end, he makes a very important point—that people have the right to choose to keep a symptom if losing the symptom might involve greater pain and discomfort. In this case, the hurt to the husband’s pride would be more painful to him than his headache. When he gave up his position as “head” of the Democratic party to reestablish himself as “head” of his family, it was too late. The pain in his head may symbolically represent the awareness, on some level, that he had been “decapitated.” And the pain also serves to prevent him from facing his situation. If he were to own up to knowing that his wife was unfaithful, he either would feel called upon to separate from her or he would feel impotent and ineffectual. He chooses to keep the headache.
