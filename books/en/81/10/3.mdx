title: PABLUM

When a six-month-old baby who is being fed Pablum looks at its mother’s face and the mother is thinking, “That horrible stuff—it just stinks,” the baby reads the headlines on mother’s face and spits it out.

All you have to do is watch small children study mother’s face or father’s face. They know just when to stop short of receiving a rebuke. And know just how many times to ask for candy and get it. No matter how many “nos” they receive. They can hear the weakening of the “no.” They know when the “no” is very weak, and an urgent request for candy yields a “yes.”




Erickson is saying that when you were a small child you were aware of the tone and other metamessages that accompanied words. He is reminding us that we were influenced by our parents’ attitudes and tastes at a time when we were in no position to test them for ourselves. This type of influence is instrumental not only in determining our habits, values, and tastes, but also, unfortunately, in our adoption of parents’ fears, prejudices, and phobias.

When he told this story to therapists, I believe he was also saying to them, “Why don’t you really pay attention to these extraverbal messages, now?” Incidentally, his repeated use of the words “know” and “no” was characteristic. He may be suggesting to a patient that he can “know” that he can say “no” to a symptom, for example. He ends the story on an “up” note, with a “yes.” The indirect or covert message, finally, is that the “no,” the negatives, will become weaker and weaker and the patient will be left with a positive attainment of success or relief—with a “yes.”
