title: A DIFFERENT SHADE OF GREEN
---




I sent one of my patients, who is a heroin addict, to sit on the lawn until he made a fantastic discovery! He was an allergist and his perception of color was phenomenal. After about an hour and a half of sitting on the lawn, he came dashing into the house and said, “Do you realize that every blade of grass is a different shade of green?” And he arranged them from very light to very dark. He was so surprised! The amount of chlorophyll in each leaf differs. Chlorophyll differs according to the rainy season, to the fertility of the soil.

Another time I had him sit on the lawn facing east. He came in and said, “The cypress tree in the next lot is leaning toward the sun, leaning southward. I turned and looked and found that you have five cypress trees on your lawn and they are all leaning southward.”

I told him, “I discovered that on my first trip to Phoenix, going all around the city, checking up on that. The first time I saw a heliotropic tree it amazed me. You usually think of trees growing straight up. And a heliotropic tree! By the sunflower you can tell the time of day.”

Have you ever heard of a flower-bed clock? My grandmother had a flower-bed clock. Morning glories opened in the morning, certain other flowers opened at seven o’clock, others at eight, others at nine, others at ten, others at noon. And there were the evening primroses, for example. The night-blooming cereus opens at about ten-thirty or eleven o’clock at night.




The allergist, trained to distinguish different skin colorations, obviously had also developed a generalized ability to perceive fine distinctions in shade and color. Of course, while purportedly talking about observing natural phenomena, Erickson is interspersing suggestions about “opening.” His comments serve as posthypnotic suggestions, so that every time the listener looks at heliotropic trees or at evening primroses he will have associations about “opening.” Subsequently he is likely to react with an opening up, not only of perceptions, but also of emotions.
