title: HOW WOULD YOU TEST A TWO-YEAR-OLD?
---




When I examined the state-orphanage children, I had to sort out the children who could not see very well, had defects of hearing, learning disabilities. And how would you test a one- or two-year-old for hearing? How would you test a two-year-old who was totally deaf? How would you discover that? And you were a total stranger. The child had never seen you.

The attendants at the orphanage thought I was not really in my right mind. I had them bring in the child walking backwards, with the attendant who led him in also walking backwards. And I had a tin pan on the side behind the desk. I dropped it on the floor. That was a heavy paperweight. And the attendant looked around and the deaf child looked at the floor. He felt quivers in the floor. Now, if I could think of that, why couldnâ€™t you? When you want to find things out about your patients, observe. Observe their behavior.
