title: MAGIC TRICKS
---




I learned some simple magic tricks when I was an intern and then a special resident in psychiatry at Colorado Psychopathic Hospital. They had just started a delinquent-boys child-guidance clinic and each member of the psychopathic hospital had to go down there and the boys resented it terribly. Each staff man served two weeks and all dreaded this. It was torture, because the boys were so antagonistic. When it came my turn, and the boy entered, glaring at me, I engaged in a simple magic trick. I turned away from him so that he couldn’t see my trick. He promptly showed me that he could get around that and he demanded that I show him the trick. Then I had to do another one. We ended up the best of friends. So I learned half a dozen tricks and the word got around and the boys all wanted to see me. They wanted something from me, and, thus, I got what I wanted from them. It was a simple matter of getting them to play with you without their realizing that you are playing them.




“It was a simple matter of getting them to play with you without their realizing that you are playing them.” This statement summarizes one of Erickson’s most important principles—that of engaging the patient’s interest while the therapist, often by the use of subliminal suggestions, “plays” the patient’s unconscious mind. That is, the therapist evokes “music” from the patient in the form of past learnings and knowledge that have been previously inaccessible to the patient. At first, most patients must experience themselves as instruments and allow the therapist to play them. With experience they can then learn to play themselves.
