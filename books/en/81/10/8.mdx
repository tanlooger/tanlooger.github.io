title: MAGIC, THE SUPERNATURAL, AND ESP
---




Like Houdini, Erickson dismissed so-called supernatural and ESP experiences as being based on trickery, illusion, or highly developed observational powers. His attitude was summarized in a letter to Dr. Ernest F. Pecci, dated June 8, 1979, in which he wrote:

“I feel that I should inform you that I do not believe that the field of parapsychology is scientifically established and I also feel that the so-called evidence for the existence of these faculties is based on false mathematical logic, misinterpretation of data, overlooking of minimal sensory cues, biased interpretation, and, frequently, on outright fraud. I have worked for over fifty years to disassociate the study of hypnosis from mystical and unscientific connotations.”

In the stories that follow, Erickson gives some entertaining examples of his own ability to fool fortune-tellers, knowing that they have learned to observe and interpret minimal body movements, including those of the lips, neck (around the vocal chords), and face. He then reveals a method that he used to “magically” locate hidden objects. Then he tells a story, which he loved to repeat, about how he fooled J. B. Rhine into believing that he possessed tremendous powers of ESP. In all these situations, Erickson is careful to point out that one need not resort to “supernatural” explanations. Most of the “ESP” feats that he describes can be explained by perfectly “normal” means. The communications are made by the sense of sight and touch. In each situation the “magician” has simply trained himself to observe the “minimal sensory cues” that most of us ignore.
