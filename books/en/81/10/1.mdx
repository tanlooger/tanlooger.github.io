title: THE RIGHT PSYCHIATRIST
---




When you listen to people talk, listen to all the possibilities. Be comprehensive and unrestrictive in your thinking and don’t just try to apply the third line, the fourth page of Carl Rogers’s book, to any patient. Think comprehensively.

A certain beautiful young woman came into my office, sat down, picked some lint off her sleeve, and said, “I know I don’t have an appointment with you, Dr. Erickson. I’ve been to Baltimore and I’ve seen all of your friends there. I’ve been to New York and seen your friends there; I’ve been to Boston and Detroit and none of them were the right psychiatrist for me. I’ve come to Phoenix to see if you are the right psychiatrist for me.”

I said, “That shouldn’t take long.” I took down her name, age, address, a telephone number, and asked a few other questions and said, “Madam, I am the right psychiatrist for you.”

“Aren’t you a bit conceited, Dr. Erickson?”

I said, “No, I’m just stating a fact. I am the right psychiatrist for you.”

She said, “That sounds awfully conceited.”

I said, “It isn’t a matter of conceit. It’s a matter of fact—and, if you want me to prove it, I can prove it—by asking you a simple question. Now, think it over carefully, because I don’t think you want me to ask that question.”

She said, “No, but go ahead and ask your question.”

I said, “How long have you been wearing women’s clothes?”

And he said, “How did you know?”

I was the right psychiatrist. Now, how did I know? That’s right. By the way he picked the lint off his sleeve. As a man I never “detour.” I don’t have anything to detour around. And women do have. He brushed the lint off without detouring. Only a man does that. And girls learn to do it even before you can see signs of changes in their breasts. In watching my daughters I discovered that happened somewhere around ten years of age. When, for example, Betty Alice was about ten years old and had to pick something off the bookcase or radio, she lifted her arm this way (as if to avoid a large breast). I told Mrs. Erickson, “When Betty Alice takes her bath have a look at her breasts.” Mrs. Erickson came out and said, “There’s just the beginning of a change in her nipples.”

A tomboy runs like a boy, throws a ball like a boy. Suddenly one day she runs like a girl, throws a ball like a girl. She runs like a boy because her pelvis is boys’ size. And one day it gets a millimeter over a boy’s size and she starts being a girl in her running.

Boys go through a stage where they are always looking in a mirror. They have a good reason. When they feel their face, the fact is that the skin of their face is becoming thicker. Thick enough, in fact, to grow whiskers. It has to get thicker before it can grow whiskers. And the thicker skin feels differently. And the boy notices something different about his face. What in hell is it? And his sisters call him vain because he is always looking in the mirror!
