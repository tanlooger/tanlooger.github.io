title: HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS?
---




There was a university student who had been captain of the baseball team in high school and he had been captain of the football team in high school. He wanted to enter A.S.U. [Arizona State University]. But he was found to have a normal one-inch difference in the length of his forearms. He was distraught. He came to me and said, “You don’t understand what it is to be crippled.”

He couldn’t study, he couldn’t work, he couldn’t go into sports. That short forearm crippled him. Doctors told his mother the facts and said that he was preschizoid.

Now, when a patient tells me that I don’t understand pain and that I don’t understand being crippled I assume they are wrong. I do. But I can point out very clearly that being paralyzed after graduating from high school hasn’t interfered with me at all. And I couldn’t move any part of my body except my eyeballs. I learned body language.

And when I went to college, the first year I saw Frank Bacon in Lightning. He became a star, saying the word “no” in the course of the play with sixteen different meanings. I went back again the next night and I counted the different meanings.




Erickson may be pointing out the difference between useful noting of differences and obsessive or hypochondriacal focusing on minimal differences, such as on a normal difference between the length of one’s forearms.
