title: FORTUNE-TELLERS

Any simple explanation that absolves you from doing any thinking is readily accepted. I’ll tell you one experience of mine. A good hypnotic subject of mine went to a fortune-teller. That fortune-teller told him intimate details about his family. And Harold was tremendously impressed. Without Harold’s knowledge—and Harold knew my family very well—I wrote out a false name for my father, my mother, for my eight siblings, and the wrong birthplace for them. I gave many false details. I put all this into an envelope and had Harold put it into his inside jacket pocket.

Then I went with Harold to the fortune-teller. To Harold’s astonishment, the fortune-teller told me my father’s name was Peter, my mother’s name was Beatrice, and he gave all the false names and false places; he gave all the false knowledge. He did not pay any attention to Harold and I suppose he thought Harold’s expression of bewilderment meant that he was impressed. And he gave all that false information and then we left.

Harold said to me, “Your father’s name is Albert. How could you say Peter?”

I said, “I kept thinking ‘Peter, Peter, Peter’ and ‘Beatrice, Beatrice, Beatrice.’”

So Harold ceased to have a belief in the fortune-teller.

In New Orleans a fortune-teller came and told a doctor friend and his girl friend’s fortunes correctly. And then he told my wife, Betty, that eventually she would fall in love with me. He told her the names that we would pick out for our children. Betty and I, when we saw the fortune-teller coming, had agreed that we would give him all the data he wanted. This would make a big impression on my friend and his girl friend. We gave the data to the fortune-teller by subliminal speech. Haven’t you watched people count and move their lips as they count? Or watch people read and move their lips? Now, my lips are really so stiff and swollen inside that I can’t really do it so that I can confuse a fortune-teller.




In both of the situations described above, the fortune-teller was able to “mind read” by deciphering subliminal or subvocal speech. Erickson had also developed this skill and this may have contributed to his reputation as a mind reader and magician.
