title: ESP WITH J. B. RHINE
---




Rhine was at a table with some subjects, demonstrating ESP. At another table, some others and I were very distrustful of Rhine. We squeezed down in our seats so that we could get a slanting view of the cards. It was night and there were electric lamps on the table. The cards were lying on the table and Rhine would turn one over. We got our heads down and got a slanting light from the card. And we could see the star impression, the diamond impression, as it showed through on the card. You see, the original cards were stamp impressed. That slight impression on the back of the card reflected light differently and if you got down at the right angle you could see it. You look at something and you see it smooth and you turn it and you can see that glimmer of roughness. So Gilbert, Watson [the others at the table], and I volunteered as subjectsâ€”and Rhine thought he had three perfect subjects, because we all read him all twenty-five cards perfectly.




As Erickson is illustrating, it is not necessary to be a trained observer to notice such distinctions as the impression on the backs of the cards. In some cases it is only necessary to look at things from a different angle or perspective.

In the following story he tells of a young man who combined careful observation with a highly developed memory to perform a remarkable feat.
