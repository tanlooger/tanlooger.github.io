title: 2. Motivating Tales

Erickson often used descriptions of earliest childhood development—learning to recognize one’s own hand, learning to stand, to walk, and to talk—as a way of building a person’s sense of his own process and growth. When he told me stories in which I was directed back to my earliest learnings, I was able—in the trance state—to reexperience the immense effort and frequent frustration involved in learning any new task or skill. At the same time, I was perfectly aware that I had learned these skills successfully. The implication was that I could learn to overcome other challenges in my present life.

As Jay Haley points out in Uncommon Therapy, Erickson had a clear-cut view of normal development. This does not mean that he tried to fit all individuals into the same pattern, but rather he believed that there was a normal, healthy core to each individual, perhaps something akin to what Horney called the “real self.” He was aware of the many ways in which growth and development could be distorted and misdirected, but he felt that it was the therapist’s task to bring the individual back to his own “real road.”

Along this line, he told a story about a horse that wandered into his family’s yard when he was a young man. The horse had no identifying marks. Erickson offered to return the horse to its owners. In order to accomplish this, he simply mounted the horse, led it to the road, and let the horse decide which way it wanted to go. He intervened only when the horse left the road to graze or wander into a field. When the horse finally arrived at the yard of a neighbor several miles down the road, the neighbor asked Erickson, “How did you know that that horse came from here and was our horse?”

Erickson said, “I didn’t know—but the horse knew. All I did was to keep him on the road.”

In beginning a course of therapy or of teaching, it is often helpful to go back to the beginning of the real road. An example of this occurs in the Erickson teaching tale “Learning to Stand Up.”
