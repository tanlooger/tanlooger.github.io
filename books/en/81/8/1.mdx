title: ON DEATH AND DYING
---




[In response to a student who expressed concern that Erickson was dying]

I think that is entirely premature. I have no intention of dying. In fact, that will be the last thing I do!

My mother lived to be ninety-four; my grandmother and great-grandmother were all ninety-three or older. My father died at ninety-seven and a half. My father was planting fruit trees, wondering if he would live long enough to eat any of the fruit. And he was ninety-six or ninety-seven when he was planting fruit trees.

Psychotherapists have a wrong idea about sickness, handicaps, and death. They tend to overemphasize the matter of adjustment to illness, handicaps, and death. There is a lot of hogwash going around about assisting families in grieving. I think you ought to bear in mind that the day you are born is the day you start dying. And some are more efficient than others and don’t waste a lot of time dying, and there are others who wait a long time.

My father had a massive coronary attack at eighty. He was unconscious when he was taken to the hospital. My sister went with him; the doctor told my sister, “Now, don’t have too much hope. Your father is an old man. He worked hard all of his life and he’s had a very, very severe coronary.”

And my sister said, “I snorted at the doctor and said, ‘You don’t know my dad!’”

When my father recovered consciousness the doctor was there. My father said, “What happened?”

The doctor told him, “Don’t worry, Mr. Erickson, you’ve had a very bad coronary attack, but in two or three months you’ll be home as good as new.”

My father, outraged, said, “Two or three months, my foot! What you mean is I’ve got to waste a whole week!” He was home in a week’s time.

He was eighty-five when he had his second and similar heart attack. The same doctor was there. My father recovered consciousness and said, “What happened?”

The doctor said, “Same thing.”

My father groaned and said, “Another week wasted.”

He had a drastic abdominal operation and had nine feet of intestine removed. When he came out of anesthesia, in recovery, he asked the nurse, “Now what happened?”

She told him and he groaned and said, “Instead of a whole week it’ll be ten days.”

His third heart attack occurred when he was eighty-nine. He recovered consciousness and said, “Same thing, doctor?”

The doctor said, “Yes.”

My father said, “Now this is getting to be a bad habit of wasting a week at a time.”

He had his fourth coronary at ninety-three. When he recovered consciousness he said, “Honest, Doc, I thought the fourth would carry me off. Now I’m beginning to lose faith in the fifth.”

At ninety-seven and a half he and two of my sisters were planning a weekend trip to the old farming community. All his peers were dead and some of their children. They planned whom to visit, what motel to stay in, what restaurants to eat at. Then they walked out to the car. When they reached the car my father said, “Oh, I forgot my hat.”

He ran back for his hat. My sisters waited a reasonable length of time and then looked at each other coolly and said, “This is it.”

They went in. Dad was dead on the floor of a massive cerebral hemorrhage.

My mother fell and broke her hip at ninety-three. She said, “This is a ridiculous thing for a woman my age to do. I’ll get over it.” And she did.

When she fell and broke the other hip a year later, she said, “Getting over that first broken hip took a lot out of me. I don’t think I’ll get over this one, but nobody will ever say I didn’t try.”

I knew, and the rest of the family knew, by my blank face, that the second broken hip would be her death. She died of congestive pneumonia, the “old woman’s friend.”

My mother’s favorite quotation was “Into each life some rain must fall. Some days must be dark and dreary.” Longfellow’s poem “The Rainy Day.”

My father and my mother enjoyed life thoroughly, always. I try to impress upon patients: “Enjoy life and enjoy it thoroughly.” And the more humor you can put into life, the better off you are.

I don’t know where that student got the idea I’m going to die. I’m going to put that off.




Erickson wanted death to be something that was not anxiety provoking, and emphasized that life was for the living. His father, he tells us, was planting fruit trees at the age of ninety-seven. The orientation was to the future. His father was active and he died while going to do something—he wanted to get his hat and to visit people. Jeffrey Zeig believes that the comment “Oh, I forgot my hat” came from an unconscious recognition that something was going on inside his head.

Erickson often followed this story by saying that his father was right to lose faith in the fourth coronary. His father died at the age of ninety-seven and one-half, of a cerebral hemorrhage. Erickson also shared his father’s attitude toward illness, which is that it is “part of the roughage of life.” Every diet needs some roughage, and Erickson would point out that soldiers on K-rations know how important roughage is in the diet. Tragedies, deaths, illness are all part of the roughage in life.

In his last years, Erickson spent considerable time preparing people for his death. He did not want extended grieving, and he used jokes and quips to diffuse people’s anxiety. Once he misquoted Tennyson by saying, “Let there be no moaning at the bar when my ship sets out to sea.” He talked openly about death. And, like his father, he was oriented toward the future when he died. He was looking forward to teaching on the following Monday. Typically, there was no funeral or burial. His ashes were scattered on Squaw Peak.

Erickson’s final comment on the story: “I don’t know where that student got the idea that I am going to die. I am going to put that off.” Put what off? Dying? Or the student’s idea?
