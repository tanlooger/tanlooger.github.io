title: DISAGREEMENTS
---




When we were first married my bride asked my mother, “When Dad and you disagree, what happens?”

Mother said, “I speak my mind freely, then I shut up.”

Then she went out into the yard and asked my father, “What did you do when you and Mother disagreed?”

And my father said, “I said what I had to say and then I shut up.”

Betty said, “Well, what happened then?”

My father said, “One or the other of us had their way. It always worked out that way.”




Erickson’s parents were married for almost seventy-five years. Obviously their marital harmony was achieved on the basis of mutual respect, and they applied the principle of never trying to force an opinion.
