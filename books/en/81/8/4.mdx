title: WORKING HER WAY THROUGH COLLEGE
---




Kristi said to me, “You worked your way through medical school. Of course, you were crippled, that made it hard. I’m younger than you were then, and I’m going to work my way through college.”

I said, “Okay, kid.”

“Now, the next question is, how much board and room are you going to charge me?”

That was a serious question. “The average board and room is twenty-five dollars a week, but you won’t have the privileges of washing dirty dishes, vacuuming the floor, making the beds, using the telephone, raiding the refrigerator.”

She said, “That’s an easy ten dollars. Well, I’ve got to go downtown and find a job.”

“Do you want a reference?”

She said, “My social-security number and my high-school diploma are my references.”

For about eight months we didn’t know where she worked. She went down to Good Samaritan Hospital, said she would like a job typing in the records room, and they looked at that little ninety-eight-pound girl, and explained to her, “You have to know a lot of medical terms, physiological terms, psychiatric terms.”

She said, “Yes, I know. That’s why I went to the library and read Dorland’s Medical Dictionary and Stedman’s Medical Dictionary and Warren’s Psychological Dictionary.”

So they tried her out and kept her.

At the end of a year, there was a lot of teenage rebellion in her and she decided to go to Michigan. Her brother asked her if she wanted any money and she said, “No.” Mother asked her, and so did I. We all got the answer “No.”

So she packed up her Phoenix winter wardrobe, took the train in late January to Michigan, and it was eleven below zero when she arrived. It took her three days to enroll and get a job in the dean’s office. The dean looked at her class cards and saw that she had signed up for nineteen hours. Working students were only allowed to take sixteen hours. Kristi said, “Well, I’m working in your office and you’ll have the opportunity to keep your eye on my work and on my grades and you’ll know what to do.” He said, “That’s right, I will.”

So she took nineteen hours. But she didn’t tell the dean one thing. The job in his office was all-important. That’s where the dormitory cards for coeds were kept.

She had located an elderly couple with a married son and a married daughter and persuaded them that young life in the home is desirable. Once a week, the married son took grandpa and grandma out to dinner. And once a week the daughter took grandpa and grandma out to dinner. Kristi sold them a bill of goods and she did a lot of cooking and cleaning and got free room and board, and the married son and the married daughter paid her baby-sitting fees.

Why was it important that she work in the dean’s office, where the cards were kept? So that the fact that she was not living in the dormitory would not be discovered. She never told anybody except us and a few trusted friends about her job in a bargain-basement store.




Erickson often used stories about the resourcefulness of his children to encourage patients to utilize their own resources. “Authority” is utilized to achieve the desired goals—in this case being able to take nineteen hours and to live off-campus. Once again, authorities (and, symbolically, “inner authority”) are seen as allies rather than opponents.
