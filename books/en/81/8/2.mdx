title: I WANT A PAIR
---




When my father ran away from home at sixteen he pinned a note to his pillow, walked into the depot, plunked down the nickels and dimes he’d saved, and said, “Give me a ticket for as far as that will go.” He landed in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, a country village. He walked down the street and looked at the local farmers, some of whom drove horses and some of whom had oxcarts. Then he stepped up to a silver-haired man driving an oxcart and he said, “Don’t you want a bright young man to help on your farm?”

The boy said his name was Charlie Roberts. He said he had no family, no money, nothing, and finally the silver-haired farmer said, “Hop in the cart. You can come with me and work on the farm.”

On the way home, the farmer stopped his oxcart and said, “You stay in that cart. I’ve got to see my son-in-law.” A girl in a flowered dress peeked out from behind a maple tree and Charlie said, “Whose girl are you?” She said quietly, “I’m my poppa’s.” He said, “You’re mine, now.”

When my father made a formal proposal seven years later, my mother reached in her little pocket and handed him a miniature mitten, because in that rural community a refusal of a proposal was called “giving a man the mitten.” My father stalked out of the house. He couldn’t sleep all night long and the next morning he walked in on my mother and said, “I didn’t ask you for a mitten, I want a pair.” The mitten was knitted from wool that my mother had washed, carded, and spun into yarn.

She had knitted that mitten when she was aged seventeen, and the proposal occurred when she was twenty. My father knew my mother. My mother knew my father. And I taught school in that country school where my mother went to school.




The name “Charlie Roberts” was adopted by Erickson’s father when he left home at the age of sixteen. The stories that Erickson told about his father highlight the father’s sense of adventure, his confidence and ability to get his own way. The latter trait recurs in all of the stories that Erickson told about his family.

The message here appears to be that you can set your eyes on a goal, stick with it, and not accept “no” for an answer. Of course, you must also do what is necessary to achieve that goal. Erickson glides over the fact that Charlie Roberts worked for his future father-in-law for several years. In other stories, rewards do not simply come because you are stubborn and persistent. The correct strategy must be applied and you must work in a way that is valued by the society you want to impress.

Even so, as Erickson points out in the next story, you can’t win them all.
