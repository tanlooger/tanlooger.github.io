title: PEARSON’S BRICK
---




Robert Pearson, a psychiatrist in Michigan, had a family practice. He was the only doctor within sixty miles. The nearest hospital was sixty miles away. He had sent his family out to visit relatives because he had a builder tear down a chimney on the third story of his house. The builder didn’t know that Pearson was home, and he was tearing down bricks and throwing them on the ground. Bob carelessly walked out of the house as a brick was falling. It hit him on the forehead and fractured his skull.

Bob started to sink to his knees, then caught himself and said, “If only Erickson was here. But, damn it, he’s in Arizona. I’d better take charge myself.” So he quickly produced a local anesthesia. He drove sixty miles to the hospital, went through the admissions procedure. Then he called a neurosurgeon and he told the neurosurgeon, “I won’t need an anesthetic.” And the neurosurgeon politely insisted on his having an anesthesia. So Bob told the anesthesiologist, “Keep a written record of everything said while I’m under the anesthesia.”

After the operation Bob recovered consciousness promptly and he told the anesthesiologist, “The surgeon said this, said this, said this.” He had total recall of everything that had been said, and the surgeon was horrified to find out Bob had heard him discussing whether they should put in a silver plate or not.

Then Bob told the surgeon, “Next Wednesday [this was on a Thursday] I’ve got to be in San Francisco delivering a paper at the annual convention.”

The surgeon said, “You’ll be lucky if you’re in bedroom slippers and a bathrobe in a month’s time.”

And Bob said, “I’d like to reach an understanding with you. On Tuesday, you come in and give me a complete physical examination. If you find nothing wrong, I go to San Francisco. If you find something wrong, I’ll stay in the hospital.” Bob said that surgeon really sweated blood during the physical examination and reluctantly discharged him.

In San Francisco I saw Bob with a Band-Aid on his forehead. He slipped off the Band-Aid and said, “What do you think about that?”

I said, “How did you get scratched?” It was a hairline scar.

Bob said, “I had a skull fracture,” and he told me the story.




This story, like Erickson’s story about his father’s heart attacks, demonstrates the power of mind over body in overcoming serious physical traumas. Pearson says, “I better take charge myself.” This idea applies to all of us, and “taking charge” can occur in extreme danger, when, out of dire necessity, we discover inner resources we did not know we possessed.

Pearson’s story demonstrates the fact that we generally have more knowledge of what is going on than we allow ourselves to know. He is able to recall even things that are said when he is under anesthesia. It is interesting that he was not only able to do this but able to anticipate doing this, since he had asked the anesthesiologist in advance to “keep a written record of everything said while I am under the anesthesia.” Of course, when Pearson gives others tasks such as this, he is taking charge of the situation, even in this particular situation where all of us would be most passive and helpless—under anesthesia.

One theme of this story is that the usual roles that we assume are reversed. The patient takes charge while the surgeons and anesthesiologist serve him. In actuality this is the doctors’ function. But most patients regress when they become sick; they put the doctor in the position of the omnipotent, powerful parent. The doctor’s actual function is to use his knowledge to treat and cure in accordance with the wishes and needs of the patient.
