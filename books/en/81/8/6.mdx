title: CALLUSES
---




A construction worker fell forty stories and wound up paralyzed except for the use of his arms. That was permanent. That was for life. He wanted to know what to do about his painful situation. I said, “There isn’t much you can really do. You can develop calluses on your pain nerves. That way you won’t feel the pain so much.

“Now, life will prove very boring, so have your friends bring you cartoons, comic books, and the nurse will furnish you with paste and scissors. You make scrapbooks of cartoons, jokes, and funny sayings. You can really amuse yourself thoroughly making those scrapbooks. Every time one of your fellow workmen lands in the hospital, send him a scrapbook.”

So he made I don’t know how many hundreds of scrapbooks.




At first Erickson redirects the patient’s concern from pain to calluses—something that the patient, a construction worker, knew about. Then he needs to direct him to something that would involve him in life, in living. He cites the truism that life will prove very boring. He directs the patient to become involved in a social activity—first having friends bring him cartoons and comic books and then giving back to others the scrapbooks that he will make. So the fellow became involved in an activity, without realizing that it would also keep him involved with people. He became more self-sufficient and able to live “outside of” his pain.
