title: NOT A SINGLE ERECTION
---




I try to tailor therapy to the individual patient. Now, a doctor came to me and said, “I had intercourse the first time in a bawdy house. The experience disgusted me. So much so that in the twenty years that have gone by I have not had a single erection. I have hired women at all levels and paid them big money and told them, ‘Make me get an erection.’ And they’ve all failed.

“Now I’ve found a girl I want to marry. I tried to go to bed with her. She’s very kind and solicitous, but I can’t get an erection.”

I said, “Let the girl talk to me and it’ll be a private talk between the girl and me and then I’ll talk to the two of you together.”

I told the girl, “Go to bed with him every night, but be a thoroughly cold woman. Don’t permit him to touch your breasts, touch your body in any way at all. Just forbid it. And it’s very important you obey these instructions.”

I called the doctor in and said, “I told Mildred that she’s to go to bed with you every night. I told her to reject any attempt at kissing, touching of her breasts, her genitals, her body. She’s to be totally rejecting of you. And I want that to take place for three months. Then you come in and discuss the situation with me.”

Early in March he lost control of himself and “raped” her.

Now, Mildred was a very beautiful woman with a beautiful figure. And when he was confronted by the impossibility derived from Mildred, not from him, it changed the frame of reference. Mildred was making intercourse impossible; he wasn’t.

So he didn’t have to hang on to his limp penis. Mildred made it impossible for him.




Since the patient’s first sexual experience in a bawdy house had disgusted him and his attempted self-cures, by “hiring” women, had reinforced his pattern of failure, Erickson determined that his impotence resulted from sex that is easily available. Therefore, Erickson, with the cooperation of the man’s girl friend, set up an opposite situation—where sex was forbidden. In his explanation of what happened, Erickson typically uses vague referents. When, in the last sentence, he says, “Mildred made it impossible for him,” we (and presumably the patient) wonder what “it” is that is impossible for him: to have intercourse? to hang on to his limp penis, i.e., to masturbate without an erection? to remain impotent? In any case, he managed to transfer the “enemy” outside of the patient. Then, instead of being angry at himself, and subsequently reinforcing his inability to have an erection, the patient could attack the cause of the “impossibility” outside himself, in Mildred. He does this by “raping” her. Once he had had satisfactory sexual relations, with no worry about achieving an erection, he presumably was then able to enjoy making love without such a strong element of aggression.
