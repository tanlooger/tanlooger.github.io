title: RAISING THEIR BIGNESS
---




My son, Robert, had put a second story on his home. The night before, he and his wife had moved upstairs. Little five-year-old Douglas and two-year-old Becky were terribly afraid because they had to be left downstairs. Robert came to me. So I advised Robert, “Douglas’s bed is lower than the parental bed.” Robert was to stress how big a boy he was and relate his bigness to the bigness of the parental bed that was left downstairs. And Becky was to relate her bigness to the bigness of Douglas’s bed.

And then I told Robert to make sure the children knew how they could use the intercom from downstairs to upstairs. And they slept beautifully, though Douglas had been very worried. He even had asked if he could sleep upstairs the first few nights.

The important thing was to concentrate on something that emphasized the self, the bigness of the bed, and that he was a big boy.




Erickson appeals to every child’s wish to grow up. Robert’s children were directed away from their fear and feeling of helplessness and toward looking at themselves as becoming bigger.

Instead of looking at what they had lost—the company of their parents—the children were directed toward the future. Douglas was being told that by looking at his parents’ bed, he was next in line to fill that bed. Similarly, Becky was reminded that she was growing bigger and would soon fill Douglas’s bed.
