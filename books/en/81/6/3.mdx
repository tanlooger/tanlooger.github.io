title: THE EASIEST GIRL TO SEDUCE
---




Now here’s a letter from a college student who came to me during her senior year. And she said, “My mother was dominated by her mother all her life. And my mother swore that when she grew up, if she ever had a child, she wouldn’t dominate her child. So my mother has been my best pal, my best friend. My mother was my best friend, my pal, all through grade school and through high school. Then I went to California, to a Catholic university there. I am a very ardent Catholic. And my mother calls me twice a week or I call her twice a week and we write letters every week to each other, as she is my best pal.

“But there is something wrong somewhere. When I went to college I went from my normal weight of 105 up to 130 pounds. The first summer I came home I dropped down to 80-odd pounds. Then when I went back to college I went back up to 130 pounds. Next summer I dropped back to 80-odd pounds. And the third summer the same thing happened. Now it’s Easter time and I am going to graduate this year. I weigh 130 pounds and I plan to spend the summer in Phoenix. And I can’t stand being so fat. I eat junk food all the time, in a compulsive way. Will you help me?”

So I put her into a trance and discussed her weight. And then I found out: the older generation cannot be a pal to a kindergarten student, to a grade-school student.

I told her that her mother wasn’t a true pal. The girl hadn’t had any boyfriends and she always confided everything to her mother. When she had a boyfriend she would drop him because he gave her funny feelings. She was unable to describe those feelings.

Now, I told her in a trance state that she needed to know certain things, that she could listen to me with her unconscious mind. Then I was going to work with her so that she could listen with her conscious mind. In a light trance state, I explained how a mother can’t be a girl’s best friend and, to the contrary, that her mother was dominating her in a way opposite to the way she had been dominated. I told her she had to think that over until she understood it. I told her we would take up the weight problem later. That summer she came back to Phoenix and only dropped down to 112 pounds. Then she said, “You’re right, my mother does dominate me in a reverse way to the way her mother dominates her. And Grandmother lives with us and she dominates Mother and dominates Father. And my father is a drunk. My mother dominates me and I would like to be a normal girl. I know I have funny feelings that I don’t understand.

So I told her, “You are an ardent Catholic, you are very devout, but you are the easiest girl in the United States to seduce.”

She looked horrified. She said, “Nobody could possibly seduce me.”

I said, “I’ll explain to you how easily you can be seduced. And you think it over. If I were a young man and wanted to seduce you, I’d ask you for a date, take you out to dinner and to a movie, and show you a most wonderful time. On the second date I would tell you that I thought you were very beautiful and that I had a strong physical attraction to you. And the rest of the date would be absolutely pure. I’d see to it that you had a good time. On the third date I’d tell you that I would really like to seduce you but I know that you are not the kind of girl that can be seduced. ‘So I’ll just drop the subject and let’s have a nice date.’ And I would advise you, ‘Don’t give me eight dates. You’ll be perfectly safe with the first seven dates. But don’t give me an eighth date.’

“Then it would be safe for you to give me a fourth date, a fifth date, a sixth date. And all the time your hormones would be working on you. On the seventh date your hormones would be well worked up. I would kiss you good-night on the forehead. I’d wait a week and call you for the eighth date. And you know what would happen.”

So she agreed about what would happen.

I said, “Now, concerning your weight, you had a bad pattern, of four years’ duration. You can’t overcome it at once. Now, for next Christmas, I want you to give me a front and mirror view of yourself wearing a bikini. And I want it hand delivered on Christmas day.”

She came in with the pictures. She was wretched and miserable. “I weighed 127 pounds when that picture was taken. And I hated myself.”

I said, “You certainly are carrying a lot of blubber. Now I don’t want to keep these pictures. You can take them back.”

She said, “I don’t want them either. I’m going to tear them up.”

A year later she weighed between 100 and 105 pounds and she had a steady boyfriend. And she said, “His hands stop at my knees—and they stop at my shoulders. I know what those funny feelings are. And I’m not going to teach another year in the Catholic school. I’m going to get a job at the public school.”

And so, this September she began teaching at a public school. And she was a very beautiful girl.




Erickson commented that when this student was at home, she was a “little” girl; when she was away from home, she was a “big” girl. He had noted this, but he did not feel that it was necessary for the patient to have this insight. Why is Erickson telling her that she can be seduced? First, he gets her complete attention with this challenge. Then, I believe, he is trying to point out that she has the capacity for normal sexual feelings—that in fact, these “funny feelings” that would cause her to drop a boyfriend were normal sexual feelings. He is letting her experience, in imagination, the way these feelings could be built up to the point where she would really feel them. Her attitude toward those “funny” feelings is reframed. She is able to feel positively about them and to think about them.

After Erickson has “seduced” her with his story, he insists that she bring him a picture of herself in a bikini. By viewing the picture, which reveals her as almost nude, he is consolidating the fantasy of intimacy that he had initiated (“seduction”). Then, as a “big” girl, away from home, she has the experience of a “lover” (Erickson) rejecting her overweight image, by referring to her “blubber” and by saying that he does not want to keep the pictures. She also rejects the overweight image of herself, by tearing up the pictures. As a result of her interaction with Erickson, she has changed her self-image and her attitude about her sexuality.
