title: WALK A MILE
---




A medically retired policeman told me, “I have emphysema, high blood pressure, and, as you can see, I am grossly overweight. I drink too much. I eat too much. I want a job but my emphysema and high blood pressure prevent that. I would like to cut down on my smoking. I’d like to get rid of it. I’d like to quit drinking about a fifth of whiskey a day and I’d like to eat sensibly.”

I said, “Are you married?”

He said, “No, I’m a bachelor. I usually do my own cooking, but there’s a handy little restaurant around the corner that I often visit.”

“So, there’s a handy little restaurant around the corner where you can dine. Where do you buy your cigarettes?”

He bought two cartons at a time. I said, “In other words, you buy cigarettes not for today but for the future. Now, since you do most of your own cooking, where do you shop?”

“Fortunately there is a little grocery right around the corner. That’s where I get my groceries and my cigarettes.”

“Where do you get your liquor?”

“Fortunately there is a nice liquor store right next to that grocery.”

“So, you have a handy restaurant right around the corner, a handy grocery right around the corner, and a handy liquor store right around the corner. And you want to jog and you know you can’t jog. Now, your problem is very simple. You want to jog but you can’t. But you can walk. All right, buy your cigarettes one pack at a time. Walk across town to buy your pack. That will start to get you in shape. As for your groceries, don’t shop at the handy grocery around the corner. Go to a grocery a half mile or a mile away and buy just enough for each meal. That means three nice walks a day. As for your liquor, you can drink all you want to. Take your first drink at a bar at least a mile away. If you want a second drink, find another bar at least a mile away. If you want a third, find another bar a mile away.”

He looked at me with the greatest of anger. He swore at me. He left raging.

About a month later a new patient came in. He said, “A retired policemen referred me to you. He said you are the one psychiatrist who knows what he is doing.”

The policeman couldn’t buy a carton of cigarettes after that! And he knew that walking to the grocery was a conscious act. He had control of it. Now, I didn’t take food away from him. I didn’t take tobacco away, I didn’t take liquor away. I gave him the opportunity to walk.




This patient was forced to reframe his behavior. He had to take it out of the category of involuntary behavior. He realized, as Erickson commented, that “walking to the grocery was a conscious act.”

Here Erickson recognized that he was dealing with a man who had a long history of carrying out orders. Therefore, he gives him orders with the expectation that the man will carry them out. This is an important example of meeting the patient in his frame of reference. One would not necessarily treat other patients in this manner.
