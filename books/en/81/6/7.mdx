title: PSORIASIS

A young woman said, “I’ve been trying to screw up my courage for months to come to see you. You notice I have on a high collar and long sleeves and it’s summertime. But last night when I saw all the dandruff on the carpet, and this morning all the dandruff in my bed, I thought, “I’ve got to see a psychiatrist. As long as I have psoriasis, he can’t do anything worse to me.”

I said, “So you think you’ve got psoriasis.”

She said, “I’d hate to be in the nude. You’d look at my body, at my arms, my neck. I could shed dandruff all over.”

I said, “Let me look at the psoriasis. It won’t kill me and you won’t die.”

She showed it to me. I looked at it carefully and I said, “You haven’t got more than one-third of the psoriasis that you think you have.”

She said, “I came to you for help because you’re a doctor. And now you’re telling me that I’ve got less than one-third of all that psoriasis and I can see how much I’ve got, and you downgrade it to a third.”

I said, “That’s right. You have many emotions. You’ve got a little psoriasis and a lot of emotions. You’re alive, you’ve got emotions; a little psoriasis and a lot of emotions. A lot of emotions on your arms, on your body, and you’ve called it ‘psoriasis.’ So you can’t have but one-third as much as you think you have.”

She said, “How much do I owe you?”

I told her.

She said, “I’ll write you a check and I’ll never see you again.”

Two weeks later she called me and said, “May I have an appointment with you?”

I said, “Yes.”

She said, “I want to apologize. I want to see you again.”

I said, “There’s no need to apologize because I made the right diagnosis and I don’t want to be apologized to.”

She said, “I guess you’re right. I shouldn’t apologize. I should be grateful that you made the right diagnosis. I don’t have dandruff any more, and look at my arms. Here and there are small patches, but that’s all. And the rest of my body too. I stayed mad at you for two weeks.”




When Erickson says to the young woman, “You have a little psoriasis and a lot of emotions,” he is equating the psoriasis and the emotions, suggesting that the more emotion, the less psoriasis and the more psoriasis, the less emotion. He then gives her the opportunity to direct her emotions toward him. When she got mad at him and stayed mad at him for two weeks, her psoriasis lessened. She had a lot of emotions and a little psoriasis.

Thus Erickson prepares his patients to find a new frame of reference by challenging them, confusing them, or stirring up unpleasant emotions. The reframing is done in harmony with a person’s own mental sets and beliefs. In “Whistleberries,” he determines first that the patient considers herself religious. With the child in “Cinnamon Face,” he adopts a playful attitude that is appropriate when dealing with a child. And he relates to the antagonistic attitude and competitive tendency of the psoriasis patient by challenging her. The psoriasis patient realizes that she was angry. She confirms for herself that Erickson was right and she did have a lot of emotion. On an unconscious level, then, the connection was made that he must be right about the other half of his declaration—that is, she had only one-third of the psoriasis that she thought she had. Her body proceeded to demonstrate this to her by losing most of its rash.

Once “Cinnamon Face” had smiled in relief at hearing herself labeled “Cinnamon Face” instead of a thief, she would be predisposed to smile anytime she thought about her freckles. Thus, her original hatred and anger was replaced by a quietly amused feeling. As Erickson explains, “It became a fun situation. “And this fun situation persisted even after she was out of Erickson’s presence.

In “Whistleberries,” the situation is reframed for the patient from one in which she was humiliated about her loss of control into one in which she could appreciate the exquisite control she actually had—that is, in being able to emit only gas while retaining liquid matter and solid matter in her rectum. She actually was urged to rejoice by dancing in the nude around her apartment while she practiced this control. Of course, on a much more superficial level, Erickson is giving her permission to fart, and this might have canceled out previous admonitions that this is a terrible thing to do. He is respecting her inhibitions, however, by not suggesting she do this in public.

Incidentally, Erickson points out that there is an addendum to the story. This acceptance of her physical being was carried over to acceptance of other natural functions; thus, she is able to expose her breast and nurse her baby while talking with him a year later.
