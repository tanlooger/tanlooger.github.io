A fifteen-year-old girl sucked her thumb constantly. Her parents called me up and wept and wailed. They said the girl annoyed them all day long by sucking her thumb. She sucked her thumb on the school bus and the school-bus driver was offended. The other children were, too. The teachers complained about her sucking her thumb. They told her they were going to bring her to me.

The girl came into the office sucking her thumb loudly, defiantly. Her parents were in the other room and could not hear what I was saying to her. “I’m going to tell you that you are very stupid about your thumb sucking,” I said.

She said, “You are talking like my parents.”

I said, “No, I’m talking intelligently. You are settling for the rather mild discomfort that your parents suffer, the rather mild discomfort that the bus driver suffers. You spread your thumb sucking all around the school. How many thousands of children are there in that school? You spread it to everybody. Now, if you weren’t stupid, if you were intelligent, you’d suck your thumb in a way that would really be a pain in the neck to your father.

“I have found out, from your father and mother, that after dinner, there is an absolutely fixed routine. Your father reads the daily paper. He sits down and he reads it, from cover to cover. I made your parents promise that they would shut their mouths about your thumb sucking. They are not to say a word to you about it.

“So please get a clock. Tonight, after supper, you sit down beside your father and slurp away on your thumb for twenty whole minutes and let your mother, who is a very routine person, get through washing dishes. She likes to do patchwork quilts. After doing the dishes she always sits down and works on her patchwork quilts. After twenty minutes with your father, you sit down beside your mother. Watch the clock and suck your thumb—thoroughly, slurp, slurp, slurp.

“I made your parents both promise that they would not say anything about your thumb sucking. And you can enjoy raising holy hell with their feelings. And they can’t do anything about it.

“As for the bus driver—you only see him twice a day. You see the school kids every day. You don’t see the school-bus driver or the school kids on Saturday or Sunday. So just spread it around. Now, normally a schoolgirl dislikes some boy or some girl in particular. So use your thumb sucking. Every time that student looks at you, pop your thumb into your mouth. And really slurp away. And every student dislikes some one teacher. Now, don’t spread it uselessly over the other teachers. Every time you see that particular teacher, shove your thumb in your mouth and slurp away.”

In less than a month she found that there are other things to do. I had made her thumb sucking obligatory and she did not want to be obliged to do anything.




When Erickson points out the “fixed routines” of the parents, he is indirectly drawing the girl’s attention to the compulsiveness of her own thumb-sucking behavior. He suggests that she might stop being “stupid” (i.e., acting without awareness or purpose). Instead, she could deliberately express her hostility more effectively. Her thumb-sucking behavior is reframed. No longer is it just a “habit,” beyond control. Now it is a useful form of communication—of hostility.

In this story, as in many of Erickson’s stories about the treatment of children, he begins with “I sent the parents out of the room and I talked with the child.” On one level, he is respecting the child as an individual, away from his parents. On another level, he is talking to the child in all of us. The parents, who often represent coercion, impatience, and lack of acceptance, are banished. They must not interfere with the therapy. On this level, Erickson is telling us to put aside the demands of our own overly stringent superego, our overly strict “shoulds,” and allow the potential of the child to emerge and develop. He may be telling us not to bury our childish impulses—our spontaneity, our curiosity, our impetuousness, our explosiveness, and so on—but to channel these impulses or direct them “intelligently.” When, like this girl, we can see the connection between what we are doing and the response of others (e.g., their annoyance), we may decide to stop that particular type of behavior.

This type of “symptom prescription” might also be considered an application of Alfred Adler’s dictum about therapy. Adler once said, “Therapy is like spitting in someone’s soup. They can continue to eat it, but they can’t enjoy it.” By making the thumb sucking obligatory, Erickson “spat in this girl’s soup.”
