title: CINNAMON FACE

A woman whom I had treated for pain came to see me. She said, “I’m not seeing you for myself now. I want to see you about my daughter, She is eight years old. She hates her sister; she hates me; she hates her father; she hates her teacher, her schoolmates; hates the mailman, the milkman, the man in the gas station—she just plain hates everybody. She hates herself. I’ve tried, for a long time, to get her to go to Kansas for the summer to visit her grandparents. She hates them but she doesn’t know them.”

So I asked, “What’s all this hate about?”

“A mass of freckles on her face. The kids in school call her Freckles and she hates those freckles terribly.”

I said, “Where is the girl?”

“She’s out in the car, doesn’t want to come in. She hates you because she’s got freckles.”

I said, “Go out and bring the girl in, even if you have to use force. And bring her into this room.”

I sat at my desk in the other room. The mother didn’t have to use force. The girl came in and stood in the doorway, her fists clenched, her jaw jutting out, glowering at me and ready for a fight.

As she stood there, I looked at her and said, “You’re a thief! You steal!”

She said she was not a thief and she did not steal. She could do battle on that score.

“Oh, yes, you’re a thief. You steal things. I even know what you stole. I even have proof that you stole.”

She said, “You haven’t got proof. I never stoled nothin’.”

I said, “I even know where you were when you stoled what you stole.”

That girl was thoroughly angry with me. I said, “I’ll tell you where you were and what you stole. You were in the kitchen, setting the kitchen table. You were standing at the kitchen table. You were reaching up to the cookie jar, containing cinnamon cookies, cinnamon buns, cinnamon rolls—and you spilled some cinnamon on your face—you’re a Cinnamon Face.”

That was two years ago.

What she did was react emotionally, and favorably, to her freckles. She was in a frame of mind to react favorably because I had intensified her hostility and anger deliberately and then raised in her mind, literally, a vacuum. Because I told her I knew where she was when she stole, I knew what it was she stole. And I had proof of it. And so, she felt relieved at the accusation of being a thief when it didn’t apply. I was really joking with her and it became a fun situation. And she liked her cinnamon rolls or buns or cookies, and I gave her freckles a new name. It was her emotions, her thinking, her reactions that were therapeutic. Although she doesn’t know it.




Later, Erickson commented on the story of “Cinnamon Face,” “You also ought to learn that it’s not what you do, it’s not what you say, but what the patient does, what the patient understands.”

I had the opportunity to see a card and note addressed to Dr. Erickson from Cinnamon Face. “Dear Mr. Erickson, I was thinking about you today. I was reading those ‘crazy’ letters you wrote me. How have you been doing? I will try to remember to send you a valentine. This year I am in sixth grade. You probably don’t remember me that well, but if you see my nickname you will. TURN OVER. My name is B——— H——— (Ciniman Face) [sic] Well, I got to by now. By



Cinnimon Face [sic]”

The card was printed in three different shades of purple crayon. And the note was accompanied by a colored photograph of a charming little girl with reddish-brown hair and a face covered with reddish freckles. She was smiling.
