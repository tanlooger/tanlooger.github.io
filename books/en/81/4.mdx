title: 4. Indirect Suggestion
---






The tales in this chapter demonstrate Erickson’s application of “traditional” hypnotic phenomena, such as literalness, age regression, and distortions of time and space. They also illustrate his unique contribution to hypnotherapy, that is, the use of indirect suggestions. His indirect approach is especially useful in dealing with what is usually called “resistance” to hypnosis and to therapy. For example, in the tale “Walking Around the Resistance,” the reality of hypnotic trance is indirectly suggested to a doubting, demanding doctor when he is confronted with another subject, who was, obviously, in a trance. For a comprehensive discussion of indirect suggestion the reader is referred to Hypnotherapy, by Erickson and Rossi.
