title: INSIDE OUT
---




At Worcester I had a patient who always returned your greeting. If you asked him a question, he looked at you brightly. He was gentle, docile, very quiet. He went to the mess hall, went to bed, was orderly, had nothing to say. He said “Hello” or “Good-bye.”

I got tired of trying to interview him. I wanted his history. And he was obviously in a world of unreality. It took me quite a while to figure out how to get into his world.

One day I walked up to him and said, “Hello.” He said, “Hello.” Then I took off my jacket, turned it inside out, and put it on backwards.

Then I took his jacket off, turned it inside out, put it on him backwards, and said, “I’d like to have you tell me your story.”

I got a history. Join the patient.




Erickson symbolically entered into the patient’s “inside-out” and “backwards” world of “unreality” when he turned his own jacket inside out and backwards. He then made the patient join him in using the same “language.” Once the two of them were in the same “world” (inside-out and backwards), they could talk to one another.

Incidentally, the fact that the patient “always returned your greeting” was a good indicator that he was likely to imitate the therapist’s behavior.
