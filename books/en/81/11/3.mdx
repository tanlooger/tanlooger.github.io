title: TWO JESUS CHRISTS
---




I had two Jesus Christs on the ward. And they spent the entire day explaining, “I am Jesus Christ.” They buttonholed everybody and explained, “I am the real Jesus Christ.”

And so I put John and Alberto on a bench and told them, “You sit there. Now, each of you tells me you’re Jesus Christ. Now, John, I want you to explain to Alberto that you, not he, are Jesus Christ. Alberto, you tell John, you are the real Jesus Christ and that he is not; you are.”

I kept them sitting on that bench, explaining to each other all day long that they were the true Jesus Christ. And after about a month, John said, “I’m Jesus Christ and that crazy Alberto says that he is Jesus Christ.”

I said to John, “You know, John, you say the same thing that he says. And he says the same things that you say. Now, I think that one of you is crazy, because there is only one Jesus Christ.”

John thought that over for a week. He said, “I’m saying the same things as that crazy fool is saying. He’s crazy and I’m saying what he says. That must mean I’m crazy too; and I don’t want to be crazy.”

I said, “Well, I don’t think you’re Jesus Christ. And you don’t want to be crazy. I’ll have you work in the hospital library.” He worked there a few days and came to me and said, “There’s something awfully wrong: every book has my name on every page.” He opened a book, showed me JOHN THORNTON; on every page he found his name.

I agreed and showed him how on every page MILTON ERICKSON appeared. I had him help me find Dr. Hugh Carmichael’s name, Jim Glitton’s name, Dave Shakow’s name. In fact, we could find any name he thought of on that page.

John said, “These letters don’t belong to a name; they belong to that word!”

I said, “That’s right.”

John continued working in the library. Six months later, he went home free of his psychotic identifications.




Erickson does not rely on ordinary methods of “persuasion” but, instead, in both instances, places John into situations where he can discover for himself that his ideas are delusional. Erickson relies on the technique of “mirroring” the patients’ behavior. In the first example, Erickson arranges for the delusion to be mirrored by another patient, who, conveniently, happens to suffer from the same delusion. In the second situation, Erickson himself mirrors the behavior, by finding his own name on the page. This “mirroring” approach is utilized by Robert Lindner in his classic story “The Jet-Propelled Couch.” Erickson once told me that Lindner had been his student and had consulted with him before publishing his book The Fifty-Minute Hour, which contains this story. The story is about a therapist whose patient lived in delusional worlds. When the therapist belabors the patient with excited tales about his own “trips” and experiences in those worlds, when he joins the patient in his delusions, the patient assumes the therapist’s role and tries to show him that the type of thinking in which they both had immersed themselves is, indeed, delusional.
