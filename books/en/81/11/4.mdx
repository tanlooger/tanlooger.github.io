title: HERBERT
---




When I first went to Rhode Island State Hospital, I had a job on the male ward, and there was a patient named Herbert who had been there for nearly a year. Before being committed to the hospital, Herbert weighted 240 pounds, was a manual laborer, and spent his time playing cards or working. He lived to work and to play cards.

He had become depressed, very seriously depressed. He began losing weight and was finally committed to Rhode Island State Hospital where, for at least four months, he had weighed only eighty pounds. He was being fed 4,000 calories a day by tube feeding without gaining.

Of course, I inherited Herbert as my patient; the other doctors were sick and tired of tube-feeding Herbert. I was a new doctor, and young, so I got the dirty work. The first time I tube-fed Herbert, I cut his tube-feeding down to 2,500 calories. I thought that was enough for an eighty-pound man.

When I tube-fed Herbert, he said, “Are you as crazy as the other doctors? Are you going to play that same lousy trick on me that all the others do, pretending to give me a tube-feeding? I know you’re bringing me a tube-feeding; I can see it. But you’re all magicians and in some way you make it disappear, as if you were Houdini! And I never get fed anything! You just put the tube down through my nose, and you say you tube-feed me, but actually you haven’t, ’cause I ain’t got no stomach.”

I listened to Herbert. His depression had resulted in a sour, acid, sardonic view of life. When he told me he didn’t have a stomach, I told him, “I think you have a stomach.”

He said, “You’re just as loony as the other doctors! Why do they have loony doctors in a crazy house? Maybe that’s the best place for crazy doctors, in a crazy house.”

So, every tube-feeding for a week I told Herbert, “Next week, on Monday morning, you’re going to prove to me that you’ve got a stomach.”

He said, “You’re hopeless. You’re crazier than the other patients around here. You think I’m going to prove I’ve got a stomach, when I ain’t got no stomach.”

On that Monday morning, I fixed Herbert’s tube-feeding—half milk, half cream, raw eggs, baking soda, vinegar, and raw cod liver oil. Now, when you tube-feed a person, you shove a column of air the length of the tube into the stomach. That’s why you pour continuously, to avoid shoving more columns of air.

I gave him his feeding, shoving many columns of air into his stomach. I withdrew the tube, stood there waiting, and Herbert burped, and said, “Rotten fish.”

I said, “You said that, Herbert. You know you burped; you know it was rotten fish. You could only burp because you’ve got a stomach, so you proved to me you’ve got a stomach, by burping.” And Herbert kept on burping!

He told me, “You think you’re smart, don’t you?”

I agreed with him.

Now, Herbert did his sleeping standing up. I didn’t know that a human being could sleep standing up, but I checked up on Herbert. The attendants were afraid to put him in bed, because Herbert fought so furiously; they let him have his way. I went down at 1 and 2 and 3 A.M., and found Herbert, sound asleep, standing up on the ward.

So I told Herbert every day for a week, “Herbert, you’re going to prove to me you can sleep lying down.”

Herbert said, “You’re hopeless; you’ve got more delusions than you can shake a stick at.”

And then the next week, every day, I asked Herbert if he ever took a bath, or ever took a shower. Herbert was very insulted by that question. Of course he took a bath; he took a shower. Any man in his right mind takes a bath, “What’s wrong with you, that you don’t know that?”

“I just thought I’d inquire.”

He said, “Do you have to inquire every day?”

I said, “Well, I need to, because you think you can’t sleep lying down, and you’ve got to prove to me that you can sleep lying down.”

Herbert said, “There is no hope for you at all.”

So, one evening, the next week, I took Herbert to the hydrotherapy room, and had him lie in the continuous bathtub. That’s a bathtub with a canvas hammock. Your body is greased with Vaseline; you lie down and a cover is put over the tub. Only your head remains above the cover. You are lying down in the bathtub, and water, at body temperature, flows continuously over your body. Now, when that happens to you, you go to sleep! There’s nothing else you can do.

The next morning I awakened Herbert. I said, “Herbert, I told you you would prove to me you could sleep lying down.”

Herbert said, “You’re a smart aleck.”

I said, “And you were able to sleep in bed.” Herbert slept in bed thereafter.

When I got his weight up to 110 pounds, I said, “Herbert, I’m tired of tube-feeding you. Next week, you’re going to drink your tube feeding.”

Herbert said, “I can’t swallow; I don’t know how.”

I said, “Herbert, next week, on Monday, you’re going to be the first man at the mess-hall door. You’ll be pounding on the door and yelling at the attendants, ‘Open the door!’ because you’ll want a glass of milk, a glass of water. I will have water and milk on one of the tables, and you will really want them.”

Herbert said, “I think you’re incurable! Too bad, a young man like you in a state hospital, with crazy people. And so young. And so crazy.”

I told him for a week that he was going to be pounding on the mess-hall door crying that he wanted a glass of milk, a glass of water. And Herbert really thought I was off my rocker.

On Sunday night, Herbert went to bed. I had the attendant spread-eagle him so that he was tied down by the hands and the feet, and couldn’t get out of bed. And I had given him his evening tube feeding with plenty of table salt in it.

Herbert got thirsty during the night—very, very thirsty. When he was released, in the morning, he rushed to the water fountain, but the water was turned off. He rushed to the toilet, to drink out of the toilet bowl, but the water had been turned off. He rushed to the mess-hall door, pounded on the door and yelled at the attendant, “Open these doors! I gotta have that water! I’ve gotta have that milk!”

He drank it.

When I came on the ward, Herbert said, “You think you’re smart.”

I said, “You told me that before. I agreed with you then and I agree with you now.”

Herbert drank milk and soup. But he held out that he could not swallow solid food. When he was up to 115 pounds I told Herbert, “Next week, you’re going to swallow solid food.”

Herbert said, “You’re a lot crazier than I ever thought. I can’t swallow solid food.”

I said, “Next week you will.”

Now, how did I make him swallow solid food?

I knew that Herbert had once been a small child. I knew I had been. I knew that all people were once small children and that they all had human nature. I just employed human nature. Now, all of you know something of human nature. How would you make Herbert swallow solid food?

I had Herbert sit down at a table, with a plate full of food in front of him. On one side was a deteriorated patient and on the other side was a deteriorated patient. And they never ate food from their plates. They always ate from somebody else’s plate. And Herbert knew that his plate was his. But the only way he could keep it his was by swallowing it! He didn’t want those damn crazy fools to eat his food! That’s human nature.

After he’d eaten his first solid-food meal, I asked Herbert how he liked his dinner. He answered, “I didn’t like it but I had to eat it. It was mine.”

I said, “I told you that you could swallow solid food.”

He said, “You think you’re smart.”

I said, “Herbert, that’s getting repetitious. I’ve agreed with you twice before. I’m still agreeing with you.”

Herbert walked away, swearing at me.

When he weighed 120 pounds I said, “Herbert, you’re eating solid food, gaining weight.”

Herbert said, “I only eat because I have to. Because if I don’t you’ll put me between those two crazy idiots.”

I said, “That’s right.”

“I ain’t got no appetite. I don’t like what I have to swallow. I have to swallow to keep those idiots from stealing it.”

I said, “Well, Herbert, you’re going to find out you do have an appetite and you do get hungry. Now, it’s January, in Rhode Island. It’s cold weather. I’ll have you dressed properly. I’m going to send you out to the hospital farm, without lunch. There’s an oak tree, fifteen feet in diameter, that I want you to chop down and reduce to kindling wood. That will work up an appetite for you.”

Herbert said, “I’ll sublet that contract.”

I said, “Even so, you’ll be out on the farm all day without a lunch. And in the evening when you return, you’ll discover that you are hungry.”

Herbert said, “You are a dreamer.”

After I sent Herbert out on the farm, I went to the chef and said, “Mrs. Walsh, you weigh 350 pounds. You like your food. Now, Mrs. Walsh, I want you to skip breakfast and lunch. I want you to go hungry. Then for dinner, I want you to prepare twice as much as you can eat of your favorite foods. And you can look forward to gorging yourself on all your favorite foods. And be very, very generous. Prepare twice as much as you can possibly eat. I’ll tell you where to set up the table.”

Herbert came in from the farm. I put him into a corner, had a table set up in front of him. I had places for two put on the table. Mrs. Walsh was on one side. Herbert was looking at her and the table. Mrs. Walsh brought out the food in huge bowlfuls. She began eating ravenously.

Herbert watched her eat, and got hungrier and hungrier. Finally he said, “Can I have some?”

She said, “Sure.”

Herbert ate, because he was hungry. My daughters, when we have a family dinner, always go out and give the dogs their bones. They always say, “The way the dogs gnaw at those bones makes my mouth water. And I want to gnaw on the same bones.”

Poor Herbert. His mouth began watering, watching Mrs. Walsh.

On the ward that evening, Herbert said, “You really are smart.”

I said, “At last you found that out! Now, Herbert, there’s one thing more I’m going to do for you. You used to play cards. You’ve been in the hospital nearly a year and you haven’t once played cards. Nobody’s been able to persuade you to play cards. Now, tonight, you’re going to play cards.”

Herbert said, “You’re crazier than ever! There is no hope for you.”

I said, “There’s hope for you, Herbert; you’re going to play cards, tonight.”

“He said, “That’ll be the day!”

That evening two tall, husky attendants on each side of him led him up to a table with four cardplayers, who were very deteriorated mentally. One played poker. One played bridge. One played pinochle. They’d deal out the cards, and each would take a turn throwing down a card. One would say, “I take that one; I have a full house.” Another would say, “I trump that.” The next might announce, “That’s thirty points for me.” And they played cards continuously all day.

Now, Herbert was forced to stand there, between the two attendants, and watch that card game. Finally, he said, “Get me away from these idiots. I’ll play poker with you if you’ll let me get away from here. I can’t stand what they’re doing with the cards.”

Later that evening I came on the ward and watched Herbert play cards. Herbert said, “You won again.”

I said, “You won.”

A few months later Herbert was discharged from the hospital. He regained weight, to my knowledge, up to 180 pounds, and worked every day. All I did for him was correct his symptoms. I put him into a situation where he corrected his symptoms.




Erickson uses the modality and the setting of a mental hospital to convey ways of getting people to want to do things.

The principle is either to force the subject to stick with a situation, often by repeating the subject’s own words, or, as in the case of Herbert, to use more complicated psychological binds. Erickson proved to Herbert that his concepts were incorrect. He proved to Herbert that Herbert did have a stomach, by forcing him to burp. He proved to him that he could sleep lying down instead of just standing up, by putting him into a continuous-bath tub. He proved to him that he could swallow, by making him so thirsty that he had to drink liquids and had to beg for them. He proved to him that he could voluntarily eat solid food by placing it between two deteriorated patients who would steal the food off his plate—unless Herbert ate it. He proved to him that he had an appetite for food, by arranging with Mrs. Walsh to eat ravenously in front of him. Finally, he provoked in Herbert the desire to play cards, by exposing him to some mentally deteriorated card players, until Herbert promised, “I’ll play poker with you if you’ll let me get away from here. I can’t stand what they’re doing with the cards.” Thus, he led Herbert to discover that Herbert did really want to see cards played correctly. In other words, Herbert learned that he had a desire for good card playing.

Erickson, rather modestly, sums up by saying, “All I did for him was correct his symptoms. I put him into a situation where he corrected his symptoms.” Actually, by correcting one symptom after another, Erickson evoked behavior patterns, ways of thinking and responding, that led Herbert to recognize that he had an appetite for life as well as for food. And once he started playing cards he could not help becoming aware that he had a social sense and a desire to interact with other people.

How did Erickson force people to respond in certain desired ways? With Herbert it is clear that he used his knowledge of ordinary human responses—competitiveness, tendency to imitate (as in developing an appetite when with the voracious eater). He also used “cognitive” approaches, as when he forced Herbert into a situation in which he could not fail to recognize, cognitively, that he must have a stomach—in order to burp.

Of course, Herbert was treated in a mental hospital, where Erickson could exert almost absolute control over his behavior. However, Erickson is illustrating the use of the psychological bind. In the psychological bind, just as in the physical bind, the patient is put into a situation that will inevitably lead to the desired result. In this case, Herbert responded, as predicted, to each challenging situation. It was as if Erickson was playing pool and had called his shots. This must inevitably impress a patient with the therapist’s ability to help him.

In this treatment, Erickson deals with one symptom at a time. He starts off in a relatively peripheral area, and once he makes a change in that symptom, he works toward more central symptoms. Each success is predicated on the fact that there was a previous success.
