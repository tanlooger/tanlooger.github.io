title: THE PATIENT WHO STOOD
---




There was a patient standing around the ward for six or seven years. He didn’t talk. He’d go to the cafeteria. He’d come back, go to bed when told, go to the bathroom when he needed to. But for the most part he stood.

You could talk to him by the hour without getting a response. One day I made certain he would make a response. I approached him with a floor polisher. A floor polisher has a twelve-by-twelve beam of wood, about three feet long, with a long handle attached. It is covered with an old rug and you push it back and forth to polish the floor.

I took one of those floor polishers over to him, wrapped his fingers around the handle. He stood there. Every day I’d tell him, “Move that floor polisher.”

So he began moving it an inch back and forth. Each day I would increase the length that he would push the floor polisher, until I had him going clear around the ward, hour after hour. And he began talking. He began accusing me of abusing him by making him polish the floor all day long.

I told him, “If you want to do something else, I’m perfectly willing.” And so he began making beds. And he began talking, giving his history, expressing his delusions. And pretty soon I was able to give him ground privileges.

He walked around the hospital grounds. And within a year’s time he was able to go home and work, and visit for a week, two weeks, three weeks, a month.

He was still psychotic but he could adjust to the outside world.




Here Erickson is illustrating the principle of initiating a small change and of gradually extending that change. We have seen this in many situations, particularly in his treatment of phobics. He also is demonstrating that he would direct a patient until the patient was able to take over for himself. I have heard Erickson say to a patient, “Until you do, I will do.” In this case the patient was directed until he finally broke his silence to complain of abuse. When he was able to “do for himself,” that is, to speak, Erickson offers him “another alternative.” The ability to make choices was the first real indication that the patient was becoming healthier.
