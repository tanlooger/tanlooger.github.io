title: 9. Capturing the Innocent Eye
---






When we think of seeing things with a fresh eye, as if for the first time, we are reminded of some popular meditation techniques. In The Book of Secrets, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh describes a sutra in which the technique is: “See as if for the first time a beauteous person or an ordinary object.” He points out that we get into the habit of not seeing familiar objects, friends, or family. “They say nothing is new under the sky. Really, nothing is old under the sky. Only the eyes become old, accustomed to things; then nothing is new. For children everything is new: that is why everything gives them excitement…” He ends the chapter with “Look freshly, as if for the first time…This will give you a freshness to your look. Your eyes will become innocent. Those innocent eyes can see. Those innocent eyes can enter into the inner world.”

We have already seen this approach of “looking freshly” in several of Erickson’s tales. In “Training the U.S. Rifle Team to Beat the Russians” (TRAINING THE U.S. RIFLE TEAM TO BEAT THE RUSSIANS), Erickson instructs the riflemen to think of each shot as if it were the first shot. In “Walking on Glare Ice” (WALKING ON GLARE ICE), the subject is led to put aside previous associations, since his eyes are closed and he is not aware that he is walking on ice. Subsequently he does not walk stiffly, preparing to fall. He can approach each step “innocently,” responding appropriately to his kinesthetic sense and trusting his sense of balance. In fact, the value of focusing on the present moment is repeatedly emphasized in the tales. The reader is likely to think of a tale, such as “Walking Down the Street” (WALKING DOWN THE STREET), while actually walking down the street. When this happens, he is bound to look at whatever he is doing with a fresh eye.

Looking with a clear view, with “openness,” is emphasized both in this chapter and in the one that follows, “Observe: Notice Distinctions.” The main difference is that the stories in the latter illustrate an “educated” clear vision that utilizes experience to interpret data.
