title: WHY DO YOU CARRY THAT CANE?
---




I gave a lecture to a large medical group, and when it was over, one of the doctors said, “I enjoyed your lecture and I followed your blackboard drawings, your illustrations, and explanations. Now, there is one thing I can’t understand. Why didn’t you use the poker that was lying in the trough? Why do you carry around the cane that you use for a poker?”

I said, “I carry around a cane because I limp. It is also handy as a poker.”

He said, “You don’t limp.”

And he learned that a lot of other members of the audience had not noticed that I limped. They just thought that it was an affectation, that I carried my cane in my pocket and then used it as a poker.

I have walked into many homes and a small child has said right away, “What’s wrong with your leg?” Because they notice that. A child’s mind is a rather open thing. Adults tend to restrict themselves. Every magician will tell you, “Don’t let children too near or they will see through the trick.” Adults have closed minds. They think they are watching everything. They aren’t watching. They have got a routine way of looking.
