title: GHOST ROGER
---




We had a dog, a male basset named Roger. When he died, my wife was very tearful. The next day in the mail there was a letter to her from Ghost Roger, from the great bone yard up yonder.

Of course Ghost Roger was quite prolific as a letter writer. And Ghost Roger picked up a lot of gossip from other ghosts, about how the kids behaved when they were young. My grandchildren read those letters and have inside information on their parents.

Children play with words and they play with ideas. And with their eidetic imagery they have cats and dogs all around them, except grown-ups can’t see them.

When we were driving from Michigan to Wisconsin to visit my parents, I could look ahead to see what was coming up. I used to talk about eating pancakes: “How big a stack would you like to eat?”

We’d come alongside a haystack: “There’s a nice stack to eat.” A stack of pancakes, a stack of hay. And so we learned to play a lot of games that way.

In hypnosis I think the best thing to do is to make use of whatever you can. It might pertain to a person’s childhood.
