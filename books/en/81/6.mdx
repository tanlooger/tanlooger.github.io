title: 6. Reframing
---






There are many examples of the reframing process in the literature of psychotherapy. One of the most memorable is Victor Frankl’s account of being in a concentration camp in his book From Death-Camp to Existentialism. While most of his fellow inmates lost hope and subsequently died, Frankl occupied his mind thinking about the lectures he would give after his release—lectures that would draw on his experiences in the camp. Thus, he reframed the potentially deadening and hopeless situation. He transformed it in his mind to a source of rich experiences that he could use to help others overcome apparently hopeless situations—physical or mental. Of course, there are skeptics who would say that this type of thinking had no effect on his subsequent survival; or that hopelessness did not necessarily condemn the inmates to death. Be that as it may, that type of thinking certainly kept his spirits and his mind alive at that time. And, it may also have kept his body alive. Again, we note that Frankl’s reframing was syntonic with his general orientation to life. He did value teaching and he had experiences with lecturing, so that it was natural for him to use this experience as source material for lectures in the future.

Watzlawick, Weakland, and Fisch, in Change, say: “To reframe means to change the conceptual and/or emotional setting or viewpoint in relation to which a situation is experienced and to place it in another frame which fits the ‘facts’ of the same concrete situation equally well, or even better, and thereby changes its entire meaning.”

These authors quote the philosopher Epictetus as saying, “It is not the things themselves which trouble me, but the opinions that we have about these things.” They point out that “our experience of the world is based on the categorization of the objects of our perception into classes,” and that “once an object is conceptualized as the member of a given class, it is extremely difficult to see it also as belonging to another class.” With reframing, once we see “alternative class memberships,” it is difficult to go back to our previously limited view of “reality.”

The following tales provide examples of ways in which Erickson used reframing.
