title: 5. Overcoming Habitual Limitations
---






In the following stories, Erickson explains two elements that are very important in extending limits. The first is establishing a mental set that is broader or less limited than the preceding one. The second is to approach the task without focusing on the limits, but focusing on the task itself. In golf, for example, “On every hole you think it is the first.” In other words, the sense of an entire context, including the number of the hole, the previous scores, and so on, is eliminated while one focuses on each stroke, each shot. The question of limits, then, does not arise. That is determined later when one looks back at the score.

If you want to become creative or to think creatively, you must practice what has been called “divergent thinking,” in contrast to “convergent thinking,” which adults tend to adopt as they become more and more restrictive in their behavior. In convergent thinking, a number of stories or a number of themes converge into one. In divergent thinking, one idea moves out into many different directions, like the branching of a tree. A book that I have found helpful in stimulating imagination and, perhaps, increasing creativity is Mental Jogging, by Reid J. Daitzman. It includes 365 mental exercises along the lines of “Name seven ways to avoid spilling coffee while driving.”

These tales are typical of those that Erickson used to stretch people’s minds.
