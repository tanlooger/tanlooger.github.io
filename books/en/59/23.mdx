Godwyn delayed the election. Earl Roland was going to be angry at the result, and Godwyn wanted to give him as little time as possible to fight the decision before the wedding.

The truth was that Godwyn was frightened. He was going up against one of the most powerful men in the kingdom. There were only thirteen earls. Together with about forty lesser barons, twenty-one bishops, and a handful of others, they governed England. When the king summoned Parliament, they were the Lords, the aristocratic group, by contrast with the Commons, who were knights, gentry, and merchants. The earl of Shiring was one of the more powerful and prominent men of his class. And yet Brother Godwyn, age thirty-one, son of the widow Petranilla, who had risen no higher than sacrist of Kingsbridge Priory, was in conflict with the earl - and, what was even more dangerous, he was winning.

So he dithered - but, six days before the wedding, Roland put his foot down and said: 'Tomorrow!'

Guests were already arriving for the nuptials. The earl of Monmouth had moved into the hospital, using the private room next to Roland's. Lord William and Lady Philippa had had to remove to the Bell Inn. Bishop Richard was sharing the prior's house with Carlus. Lesser barons and knights filled the taverns, along with their wives and children, squires and servants and horses. The town enjoyed a surge of spending, much needed after the disappointing profits from the rain-drenched Fleece Fair.

On the morning of the election Godwyn and Simeon went to the treasury, a small windowless room behind a heavy oak door off the library. The precious ornaments used for special services were there, locked in an ironbound chest. Simeon as treasurer held the keys.

The election was a foregone conclusion, or so thought everyone except Earl Roland. No one suspected Godwyn's hidden hand. He had suffered one tense moment, when Thomas had wondered aloud how Friar Murdo got to know about the Isabella charter. 'He can't have discovered it accidentally - he's never been seen reading in the library, and anyway that deed isn't kept with the others,' Thomas had said to Godwyn. 'Someone must have told him about it. But who? Only Carlus and Simeon knew of it. Why would they have let the secret out? They didn't want to help Murdo.' Godwyn had said nothing, and Thomas had remained baffled.

Godwyn and Simeon dragged the treasure chest into the light of the library. The cathedral jewels were wrapped in blue cloth and cushioned in protective sheets of leather. As they sorted through the box, Simeon unwrapped some of the items, admiring them and checking that they were undamaged. There was a plaque a few inches wide made of ivory, delicately carved, showing the crucifixion of St. Adolphus, at which the saint had asked God to grant good health and long life to all those who venerated his memory. There were numerous candlesticks and crucifixes, all of gold or silver, most decorated with precious stones. In the strong light from the tall library windows the gems glittered and the gold glowed. These things had been given to the priory, over the centuries, by devout worshippers. Their combined value was awesome: there was more wealth here than most people ever saw in one place.

Godwyn had come for a ceremonial crosier, or shepherd's crook, made of wood encased in gold, with an elaborately jeweled handle. This was ritually handed to the new prior at the end of the election process. The crook was at the bottom of the chest, not having been used for thirteen years. As Godwyn drew it out, Simeon let out an exclamation.

Godwyn looked up sharply. Simeon was holding a large crucifix on a stand, intended to be placed on an altar. 'What's the matter?' Godwyn said.

Simeon showed him the back of the cross and pointed to a shallow cup-shaped indentation just below the crosspiece. Godwyn immediately saw that a ruby was missing. 'It must have fallen out,' he said. He glanced around the library: they were alone.

They were both worried. As treasurer and sacrist they shared responsibility. They would be blamed for any loss.

Together they examined every item in the chest. They unwrapped each one and shook out every blue cloth. They looked at all the leather sheets. Frantically, they scrutinized the empty box and the floor all around. The ruby was nowhere to be seen.

Simeon said: 'When was the crucifix last used?'

'At the feast of St. Adolphus, when Carlus fell. He knocked it off the table.'

'Perhaps the ruby fell out then. But how is it possible that no one noticed?'

'The stone was on the back of the cross. But surely someone would have seen it on the floor?'

'Who picked up the crucifix?'

'I don't remember,' Godwyn said quickly. 'The situation was confused.' In fact he remembered perfectly well.

It was Philemon.

Godwyn could picture the scene. Philemon and Otho together had righted the altar, setting it squarely on its platform. Then Otho had picked up the candlesticks and Philemon the cross.

With a growing feeling of dismay, Godwyn recalled the disappearance of Lady Philippa's bracelet. Had Philemon stolen again? He trembled to think how it might affect him. Everyone knew that Philemon was Godwyn's unofficial acolyte. Such a dreadful sin - stealing a jewel from a sacred ornament - would bring shame on everyone associated with the perpetrator. It could easily upset the election.

Simeon obviously did not recollect the scene exactly, and he accepted without question Godwyn's feigned inability to remember who had picked up the cross. But others among the monks would surely recall seeing it in Philemon's hands. Godwyn had to put this right quickly, before suspicion could fall on Philemon. But first he had to get Simeon out of the way.

'We must search for the ruby in the church,' Simeon said.

'But the service was two weeks ago,' Godwyn protested. 'A ruby can't have lain on the floor unnoticed for that length of time.'

'It's unlikely, but we must check.'

Godwyn saw that he had to go with Simeon, and wait for an opportunity to get away from him and seek out Philemon. 'Of course,' he said.

They put the ornaments away and locked the treasury door. As they left the library, Godwyn said: 'I suggest we say nothing about this until we're sure the jewel has been lost. No point in bringing blame on our heads prematurely.'

'Agreed.'

They hurried around the cloisters and entered the church. They stood in the center of the crossing and scanned the ground all around them. A month ago, the idea that a ruby could lie hidden somewhere on the church floor would have been more plausible; but recently the flagstones had been repaired, and the cracks and chips had disappeared. A ruby would have stood out.

Simeon said: 'Now that I come to think of it, wasn't it Philemon who picked up the crucifix?'

Godwyn looked at Simeon's face. Was there accusation in the expression? He could not tell. 'It may have been Philemon,' Godwyn said. Then he saw a chance to get away. 'I'll go and fetch him,' he suggested. 'Perhaps he will be able to recall exactly where he was standing at the time.'

'Good idea. I'll wait here.' Simeon got down on his knees and began to pat the floor with his hands, as if the ruby might be found by touch more easily than by sight.

Godwyn hurried out. He went first to the dormitory. The blanket cupboard was in the same place. He pulled it away from the wall, found the loose stone, and removed it. He put his hand into the hidey-hole where Philemon had stashed Lady Philippa's bracelet.

He found nothing there.

He cursed. It was not going to be that easy.

I'll have to dismiss Philemon from the monastery, he thought as he strode through the priory buildings looking for him. If he has stolen this ruby, I can't cover up for him again. He's out.

Then he realized, with a shock of dismay, that he could not dismiss Philemon - not now, perhaps not ever. It was Philemon who had told Friar Murdo about the Isabella charter. If dismissed, Philemon could confess what he had done, and reveal that he had done it at Godwyn's instigation. And he would be believed. Godwyn recalled Thomas's puzzling over who had told Murdo the secret, and why. Philemon's revelation would gain conviction by answering that question.

There would be an outcry at such underhand work. Even if the disclosure were made after the election, it would undermine Godwyn's authority and cripple his ability to lead the monks. The ominous truth dawned on him that he now had to protect Philemon in order to protect himself.

He found Philemon sweeping the hospital floor. He beckoned him outside and led him around to the back of the kitchen, where it was unlikely that anyone would see them.

He looked Philemon in the eye and said: 'There's a ruby missing.'

Philemon looked away. 'How terrible.'

'It's from the altar crucifix that was knocked to the floor when Carlus fell over.'

Philemon pretended innocence. 'How could it have gone missing?'

'The ruby may have become dislodged when the crucifix hit the floor. But it's not on the floor now - I've just looked. Someone found it - and kept it.'

'Surely not.'

Godwyn felt angered by Philemon's false air of innocence. 'You fool, everyone saw you pick up that crucifix!'

Philemon's voice rose to a higher pitch. 'I know nothing about it!'

'Don't waste time lying to me! We have to put this right. I could lose the election on your account.' Godwyn pushed Philemon up against the wall of the bakehouse. 'Where is it?'

To his astonishment, Philemon began to cry.

'For the love of the saints,' Godwyn said disgustedly. 'Stop this nonsense - you're a grown man!'

Philemon continued to sob. 'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I'm sorry.'

'If you don't stop that - ' Godwyn checked himself. Nothing was to be gained by berating Philemon. The man was truly pathetic. Speaking more gently, he said: 'Try to pull yourself together. Where is the ruby?'

'I hid it.'

'Yes...'

'In the refectory chimney.'

Godwyn immediately turned away, heading for the refectory. 'Mary save us, it could fall into the fire!'

Philemon followed, his tears drying. 'There's no fire in August. I would have moved it before the cold weather.'

They entered the refectory. At one end of the long room was a wide fireplace. Philemon put his arm up the chimney and fumbled for a moment. Then he produced a ruby the size of a sparrow's egg, covered with soot. He wiped it clean on his sleeve.

Godwyn took it. 'Now come with me,' he said.

'What are we going to do?'

'Simeon is going to find this.'

They went to the church. Simeon was still searching on hands and knees. 'Now,' Godwyn said to Philemon. 'Try to remember exactly where you were when you picked up the crucifix.'

Simeon looked at Philemon and, seeing signs of emotion on his face, spoke kindly to him. 'Don't be afraid, lad, you've done nothing wrong.'

Philemon positioned himself on the east side of the crossing, close to the steps leading up to the chancel. 'I think it was here,' he said.

Godwyn climbed the two steps and looked under the choir stalls, pretending to search. Surreptitiously, he placed the ruby under one of the rows of seats, close to the near end, where it was not visible to a casual glance. Then, as if changing his mind about the likeliest place to look, he moved to the south side of the chancel. 'Come and search under here, Philemon,' he said.

As he had hoped, Simeon then moved to the north side and got down on his knees to look under the stalls, murmuring a prayer as he did so.

Godwyn expected Simeon to see the ruby immediately. He pretended to search the south aisle, waiting for Simeon to find it. He began to think there must be something wrong with Simeon's eyesight. He might have to go over there and 'find' it himself. Then at last Simeon called out: 'Oh! Here!'

Godwyn pretended to be excited. 'Have you found it?'

'Yes! Hallelujah!'

'Where was it?'

'Here - under the choir stalls!'

'Praise be to God,' said Godwyn.





Godwyn told himself not to be frightened of Earl Roland. As he climbed the stone stairs of the hospital to the guest rooms, he asked himself what the earl could do to him. Even if Roland had been capable of getting out of his bed and drawing a sword, he would not be foolish enough to attack a monk within the precincts of a monastery - even a king would hardly get away with that.

Ralph Fitzgerald announced him, and he went into the room.

The earl's sons stood either side of the bed: tall William, in soldierly brown hose and muddy boots, his hair already receding from his forehead; and Richard, in bishop's purple, his growing roundness of figure evidence of a sybaritic nature and the means to indulge it. William was thirty, a year younger than Godwyn; he had his father's strength of will, but it was sometimes softened by the influence of his wife, Philippa. Richard was twenty-eight, and presumably took after his late mother, for he had little of the earl's imposing bearing and forcefulness.

'Well, monk?' said the earl, speaking out of the left side of his mouth. 'Have you held your little election?'

Godwyn suffered a moment of resentment for this discourteous form of address. One day, he vowed silently, Roland would call him Father Prior. Indignation gave him the courage he needed to tell the earl the news. 'We have, Lord,' he said. 'I have the honor to tell you that the monks of Kingsbridge have chosen me as their prior.'

'What?' the earl bellowed. 'You?'

Godwyn bowed his head in an affectation of humility. 'No one could be more surprised than I.'

'You're nothing but a boy!'

The insult stung Godwyn into a rejoinder. 'I'm older than your son, the bishop of Kingsbridge.'

'How many votes did you get?'

'Twenty-five.'

'And how many for Friar Murdo?'

'None. The monks were unanimous - '

'None?' Roland roared. 'There must have been a conspiracy - this is treason!'

'The election was held in strict accordance with the rules.'

'I don't care a pig's prick for your rules. I won't be ignored by a bunch of effeminate monks.'

'I am the choice of my brothers, my lord. The inauguration ceremony will be held this coming Sunday, before the wedding.'

'The monks' choice must be ratified by the bishop of Kingsbridge. And I can tell you he will not ratify you. Rerun the election, and this time bring me the result I want.'

'Very good, Earl Roland.' Godwyn went to the door. He had several more cards in his hand, but he was not going to lay them on the table all at once. He turned and addressed Richard. 'My lord bishop, when you wish to speak to me about this, you will find me in the prior's house.'

He stepped outside. 'You're not the prior!' Roland shouted as he shut the door.

Godwyn was trembling. Roland was formidable, especially when angry, and he was often angry. But Godwyn had stood his ground. Petranilla would be proud of him.

He went down the stairs on shaky legs and made his way to the prior's house. Carlus had already moved out. For the first time in fifteen years, Godwyn would have a bedroom to himself. His pleasure was only slightly damped by having to share the place with the bishop, who traditionally stayed there while visiting. The bishop was, technically, the abbot of Kingsbridge ex officio and, though his power was limited, his status was above that of the prior. Richard was rarely in the house during the day, but returned every night to sleep in the best bedroom.

Godwyn entered the ground-floor hall and sat in the big chair, waiting. It would not be long before Bishop Richard appeared, his ears burning with his father's scorching instructions. Richard was a rich and powerful man, but not frightening in the way the earl was. All the same, it was a bold monk who defied his bishop. However, Godwyn had an advantage in this confrontation, for he knew something shameful about Richard, and that was as good as a knife up his sleeve.

Richard bustled in a few minutes later, showing a confidence that Godwyn knew to be faked. 'I've struck a bargain for you,' he said without preamble. 'You can be subprior under Murdo. You'll be in charge of day-to-day management of the priory. Murdo doesn't want to be an administrator, anyway - he just wants the prestige. You'll have all the power, but my father will be satisfied.'

'Let me get this straight,' said Godwyn. 'Murdo agrees to make me his subprior. Then we tell the rest of the monks that he is the only one you'll ratify. And you think they will accept that.'

'They have no choice!'

'I have an alternative suggestion. Tell the earl that the monks will not have anyone but me - and that I must be ratified before the wedding, otherwise the monks will not take part in the nuptials. The nuns, too, will refuse.' Godwyn did not know whether the monks would go along with this - let alone Mother Cecilia and the nuns - but he was too far gone for caution.

'They wouldn't dare!'

'I'm afraid they would.'

Richard looked panicky. 'My father won't be bullied!'

Godwyn laughed. 'Small chance of that. But I hope he may be made to see reason.'

'He'll say the wedding must go ahead anyway. I'm the bishop, I can marry the couple, I don't need monks to help me.'

'Of course. But there will be no singing, no candles, no psalms, no incense - just you and Archdeacon Lloyd.'

'They will still be married.'

'How will the earl of Monmouth feel about such a mean wedding for his son?'

'He'll be furious, but he'll accept it. The alliance is the important thing.'

That was probably right, Godwyn thought, and he felt the cold draft of imminent failure.

It was time to draw his concealed knife.

'You owe me a kindness,' he said.

At first, Richard pretended not to know what he was talking about. 'Do I?'

'I concealed a sin you committed. Don't pretend to have forgotten, it was only a couple of months ago.'

'Ah, yes, that was generous of you.'

'I saw, with my own eyes, you and Margery on the bed in the guest room.'

'Hush, for pity's sake!'

'Now is your chance to repay me that kindness. Intercede with your father. Tell him to give in. Argue that the wedding is more important. Insist on ratifying me.'

Richard's face showed desperation. He looked crushed by opposing forces. 'I can't!' he said, and there was panic in his voice. 'My father won't be defied. You know what he's like.'

'Try.'

'I've already tried! I forced him to concede that you could be subprior.'

Godwyn doubted that Roland had conceded any such thing. Richard had almost certainly made it up, knowing that such a promise could easily be broken. All the same, Godwyn said: 'I thank you for that.' Then he added: 'But it's not enough.'

'Just think about it,' Richard pleaded. 'That's all I ask.'

'I will. And I suggest you ask your father to do the same.'

'Oh, God,' Richard groaned. 'This is going to be a catastrophe.'





The wedding was scheduled for Sunday. On the Saturday, in place of the service of Sext, Godwyn ordered a rehearsal, beginning with the ceremony of inauguration of the new prior and continuing with the marriage service. Outside it was another sunless day, the sky full of low, gray cloud heavy with rain, and the inside of the cathedral was gloomy. After the rehearsal, as the monks and nuns headed off for dinner and the novices began to tidy up the church, Godwyn was approached by Carlus and Simeon, both looking solemn.

'I think that went very smoothly, don't you?' Godwyn said brightly.

Simeon said: 'Is there actually going to be an inauguration for you?'

'Absolutely.'

'We hear the earl has ordered the election to be rerun.'

'Do you think he has the right to do that?'

'Indeed not,' said Simeon. 'He has the power of nomination, that's all. But he says Bishop Richard will not ratify you as prior.'

'Has Richard told you that?'

'Not himself, no.'

'I thought not. Trust me, the bishop will ratify me.' Godwyn heard his own voice sounding sincere and confident, and wished his feelings matched it.

Carlus said anxiously. 'Did you tell Richard the monks would refuse to take part in the wedding?'

'I did.'

'That's very hazardous. We're not here to oppose the will of noblemen.'

Godwyn could have predicted that Carlus would weaken at the first sign of serious opposition. Fortunately, he was not planning to test the monks' resolve. 'We won't have to do it, don't worry. It's just an empty threat. But don't tell the bishop I said so.'

'So you're not planning to ask the monks to boycott the wedding?'

'No.'

Simeon said: 'You're playing a dangerous game.'

'Perhaps - but I trust no one is in danger except me.'

'You did not even want to be prior. You would not allow your name to be put forward. You only accepted when all else failed.'

'I don't want to be prior,' Godwyn lied. 'But the earl of Shiring must not be allowed to choose for us, and that's more important than my personal feelings.'

Simeon looked at him with respect. 'You're being very honorable.'

'Like you, Brother, I'm just trying to do the will of God.'

'May He bless your efforts.'

The two old monks left him. He felt a twinge of conscience for allowing them to believe that he was acting unselfishly. They saw him as some kind of martyr. But it was true, he told himself, that he was only trying to do the will of God.

He looked around: the church was back to normal. He was about to go to the prior's house for dinner when his cousin Caris appeared, her blue dress a startling splash of color in the dim, gray church. 'Are you going to be inaugurated tomorrow?' she said.

He smiled. 'Everyone's asking the same question. The answer is yes.'

'We hear the earl is putting up a fight.'

'He's going to lose it.'

Her shrewd green eyes gave him a penetrating stare. 'I've known you since you were a child, and I can tell when you're lying.'

'I'm not lying.'

'You're pretending to be more certain than you actually feel.'

'That's not a sin.'

'My father is worried about the bridge. Friar Murdo is even more likely to obey the earl's will than Saul Whitehead was.'

'Murdo is not going to be prior of Kingsbridge.'

'There you go again.'

Godwyn was annoyed by her perspicacity. 'I don't know what to say to you,' he snapped. 'I've been elected, and I mean to take the post. Earl Roland would like to stop me, but he doesn't have the right, and I'm fighting him with all the means at my disposal. Am I scared? Yes. But I still intend to beat him.'

She grinned. 'That's what I wanted to hear.' She punched his shoulder. 'Go and see your mother. She's in your house, waiting for you. That's what I came to tell you.' With that she turned and left.

Godwyn went out through the north transept. Caris was clever, he thought with a mixture of admiration and irritation. She had cajoled him into giving her an assessment of the situation more candid than anything he had said to anyone else.

But he was glad of the chance to talk to his mother. Everyone else doubted his power to win this fight. She would have confidence - and perhaps some strategic ideas.

He found Petranilla in the hall, sitting at the table, which was laid for two with bread, ale, and a platter of salted fish. He kissed her forehead, said grace, and sat down to eat. He allowed himself a moment of triumphant pleasure. 'Well,' he said. 'I'm the prior-elect, at least, and here we are having dinner in the prior's house.'

'But Roland is still fighting you,' she said.

'Harder than I expected. After all, he has the right of nomination, not selection. It's inherent in his position that his choice will not always be elected.'

'Most earls would accept that, but not him,' Petranilla said. 'He's felt superior to everyone he's ever met.' There was a bitterness in her tone which, Godwyn guessed, sprang from memories of their aborted engagement more than thirty years ago. She smiled vengefully. 'Soon he will realize how badly he's underestimated us.'

'He knows I'm your son.'

'Then that will be a factor. You probably remind him of the dishonorable way he behaved to me. That's enough to make him hate you.'

'It's a shame.' Godwyn lowered his voice in case a servant might be listening outside the door. 'Until this point, your plan has worked perfectly. Withdrawing myself from the contest, then discrediting everyone else, was brilliant.'

'Perhaps. But we may be about to lose everything. Have you said any more to the bishop?'

'No. I've reminded him that we know about Margery. He was scared, but not scared enough to defy his father, it seems.'

'He should be. If this comes out, he won't be forgiven. He could end up a lowly knight on the level of Sir Gerald, wasting his days as a pensioner. Doesn't he realize that?'

'Perhaps he thinks I don't have the courage to reveal what I know.'

'Then you'll have to go to the earl with the information.'

'Heavens! He'll explode!'

'Steel your nerve.'

She always said this kind of thing. It was why he looked forward with such apprehension to meetings with her. She always wanted him to be a little more daring, and take greater risks, than was his inclination. But he could never refuse her.

She went on: 'If it came out that Margery's not a virgin, the marriage would be called off. Roland doesn't want that. He'll accept the lesser evil of you as prior.'

'But he'll be my enemy for the rest of his life.'

'He'll be that whatever happens.'

Small consolation, Godwyn thought; but he did not argue, for he could see that his mother was right.

There was a tap at the door, and Lady Philippa walked in.

Godwyn and Petranilla stood up.

'I need to talk to you,' Philippa said to Godwyn.

He said: 'May I present my mother, Petranilla?'

Petranilla curtsied, then said: 'I'd better leave. You're obviously here to broker a deal, my lady.'

Philippa gave her an amused look. 'If you know that much, you know everything of importance. Perhaps you should stay.'

As the two women stood facing one another, Godwyn noticed that they were similar: same height, same statuesque build, and the same imperious air. Philippa was younger, of course, by something like twenty years; and she had a relaxed authority, and a touch of humor, that contrasted with Petranilla's tight-wound determination - perhaps because Philippa had a husband and Petranilla had lost hers. But Philippa was a strong-willed woman who exercised power through a man - Lord William - and, Godwyn now realized, Petranilla also wielded influence through a man - himself.

'Let's sit down,' Philippa said.

Petranilla said: 'Has the earl approved whatever you're about to propose?'

'No.' Philippa made a helpless gesture with her hands. 'Roland is too proud to agree in advance to something that might then be rejected by the other side. If I can get Godwyn's agreement to what I'm about to suggest, then I've got a chance of persuading Roland to compromise.'

'I thought as much.'

Godwyn said: 'Would you like something to eat, my lady?'

Philippa dismissed the offer with an impatient wave. 'As things stand, everyone is going to lose,' she began. 'The wedding will take place, but without the proper pomp and ceremony; so that Roland's alliance with the earl of Monmouth will be blighted from the start. The bishop will refuse to ratify you as prior, Godwyn, so the archbishop will be called in to resolve the dispute; and he will dismiss both you and Murdo, and nominate someone new, probably a member of his staff whom he wants to be rid of. No one will get what they want. Am I right?'

She directed the question at Petranilla, who made a noncommittal sound.

'So why not anticipate the archbishop's compromise?' Philippa went on. 'Bring forward the third candidate now. Only' - she pointed a finger at Godwyn - 'the candidate is chosen by you - and he promises to make you subprior.'

Godwyn considered. This would relieve him of the need to confront the earl eyeball-to-eyeball and threaten him with the revelation of his son's behavior. But the compromise would doom him to be subprior for an indefinite period - and then, when the new prior died, he would have to fight the battle all over again. He was inclined to refuse, despite his apprehension.

He glanced at his mother. She gave an almost imperceptible shake of the head. She did not like it either.

'I'm sorry,' Godwyn said to Philippa. 'The monks have held an election, and the result must stand.'

Philippa stood up. 'In that case, I must give you the message that is my official reason for coming here. Tomorrow morning the earl will rise from his sickbed. He wishes to inspect the cathedral and make sure all is ready in plenty of time for the wedding. You are to meet him in the church at eight o'clock. All the monks and nuns must be robed and ready, and the church dressed with the usual ornaments.'

Godwyn bowed his head in acknowledgment, and she went out.





At the appointed hour Godwyn stood in a bare, silent church.

He was alone: there were no monks or nuns with him. No furniture was to be seen, except for the fixed choir stalls. There were no candles, no crucifixes, no chalices, no flowers. The watery sun that had shone fitfully through rain clouds much of this summer now cast a weak, cold light into the nave. Godwyn held his hands tightly together behind his back to keep them from shaking.

On time, the earl walked in.

With him were Lord William, Lady Philippa, Bishop Richard, Richard's assistant Archdeacon Lloyd, and the earl's clerk Father Jerome. Godwyn would have liked to surround himself with an entourage, but none of the monks knew quite how risky his scheme was, and if they had known, they might not have had the nerve to back him up; so he had decided to face the earl alone.

The bandages had been removed from Roland's head. He walked slowly but steadily. He must surely feel shaky after so many weeks in bed, Godwyn thought, but he seemed determined not to show it. He looked normal apart from the paralysis of half his face. His message to the world today would be that he was fully recovered and back in charge. And Godwyn was threatening to spoil that design.

The others looked with incredulity at the empty church, but the earl showed no surprise. 'You're an arrogant monk,' he said to Godwyn, speaking as always out of the left side of his mouth.

Godwyn was risking everything, and had nothing further to lose by being defiant, so he said: 'You're an obstinate earl.'

Roland put his hand on the hilt of his sword. 'I ought to run you through for that.'

'Go ahead.' Godwyn held his arms out sideways, ready to be crucified. 'Murder the prior of Kingsbridge, here in the cathedral, just as King Henry's knights murdered Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury. Send me to Heaven and yourself to eternal damnation.'

Philippa gasped with shock at Godwyn's disrespect. William moved as if to silence Godwyn. Roland restrained him with a gesture, and said to Godwyn: 'Your bishop orders you to ready the church for the wedding. Don't monks take a vow of obedience?'

'The lady Margery cannot be married here.'

'Why not - because you want to be prior?'

'Because she is not a virgin.'

Philippa's hand flew to her mouth. Richard groaned. William drew his sword. Roland said: 'This is treason!'

Godwyn said: 'Put away your sword, Lord William - you can't restore her maidenhead with that.'

Roland said: 'What do you know of such things, monk?'

'Two men of this priory witnessed the act, which took place in a private room of the hospital, the very room where you, my lord, are staying.'

'I don't believe you.'

'The earl of Monmouth will.'

'You would not dare to tell him.'

'I must explain to him why his son cannot marry Margery in Kingsbridge Cathedral - at least until she has confessed her sin and received absolution.'

'You have no proof of this slander.'

'I have two witnesses. But ask the girl. I believe she will confess. I imagine she favors the lover who took her virginity over the political match chosen by her uncle.' Once again Godwyn was going out on a limb. But he had seen Margery's face when Richard was kissing her, and at that moment he had felt sure she was in love. Having to marry the earl's son must be breaking her heart. It would be very difficult for such a young woman to lie convincingly if her emotions were as turbulent as Godwyn guessed.

The animated half of Roland's face was working with fury. 'And who is this man who you claim committed this crime? For, if you can prove what you allege, the villain will hang, I swear. And, if not, you will. So let him be sent for, and we'll see what he has to say.'

'He's already here.'

Roland looked with incredulity at the four men with him - his two sons, William and Richard, plus two priests, Lloyd and Jerome.

Godwyn stared at Richard.

Roland followed the direction of Godwyn's stare. In a moment, they were all looking at Richard.

Godwyn held his breath. What would Richard say? Would he bluster? Would he accuse Godwyn of lying? Would he fly into a rage and attack his accuser?

But his face showed defeat, not anger, and after a moment he bowed his head and said: 'It's no good. The damned monk is right - she will not withstand interrogation.'

Earl Roland went white. 'You did this?' he said. For once he was not shouting, but that seemed to make him more terrifying. 'The girl I betrothed to an earl's son - you fucked her?'

Richard made no reply, but looked down at the ground.

'You fool,' the earl said. 'You traitor. You - '

Philippa interrupted him. 'Who else knows?'

That stopped the tirade. They all looked at her.

'Perhaps the wedding may still take place,' she said. 'Thank God, the earl of Monmouth isn't here.' She looked at Godwyn. 'Who knows about this, other than the people here now, and the two men of the priory who witnessed the act?'

Godwyn tried to calm his thudding heart. He was so close to success that he seemed to taste it. 'No one else knows, my lady,' he said.

'All of us on the earl's side can keep the secret,' she said. 'What about your men?'

'They will obey their elected prior,' he said, with the slightest emphasis on the word 'elected.'

Philippa turned to Roland. 'Then the wedding can take place.'

Godwyn added: 'Provided the inauguration ceremony is held first.'

Everyone looked at the earl.

He took a step forward and suddenly hit Richard in the face. It was a powerful blow struck by a soldier who knew how to put all his weight into it. Although he used his open hand, Richard was knocked to the ground.

Richard lay still, looking terrified, blood trickling from his mouth.

Earl Roland's face was white and sweating: the blow had used up all his reserves, and he now looked shaky. Several silent seconds passed. At last he seemed to recover his strength. With a contemptuous glance at the purple-robed figure cowering on the floor, he turned on his heel and walked, slowly but steadily, out of the church.
