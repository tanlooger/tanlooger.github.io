On the morning of Tilly's burial, Caris and Merthin met on the roof of the cathedral at dawn.

The roof was a world apart. Calculating the acreage of slates was a perennial geometry exercise in the advanced mathematics class at the priory school. Workmen needed constant access for repairs and maintenance, so a network of walkways and ladders linked the slopes and ridges, corners and gulleys, turrets and pinnacles, gutters and gargoyles. The crossing tower had not yet been rebuilt, but the view from the top of the west facade was impressive.

The priory was already busy. This would be a big funeral. Tilly had been a nobody in life, but now she was the victim of a notorious murder, a noblewoman killed in a nunnery, and she would be mourned by people who had never spoken three words to her. Caris would have liked to discourage mourners, because of the risk of spreading the plague, but there was nothing she could do.

The bishop was already here, in the best room of the prior's palace - which was why Caris and Merthin had spent the night apart, she in the nuns' dormitory and he and Lolla at the Holly Bush. The grieving widower, Ralph, was in a private room upstairs at the hospital. His baby, Gerry, was being taken care of by the nuns. Lady Philippa and her daughter, Odila, the only other surviving relatives of the dead girl, were also staying at the hospital.

Neither Merthin nor Caris had spoken to Ralph when he arrived yesterday. There was nothing they could do, no way to get justice for Tilly, for they could prove nothing; but all the same they knew the truth. So far they had told no one what they believed: there was no point. During today's obsequies they would have to pretend something like normalcy with Ralph. It was going to be difficult.

While the important personages slept, the nuns and the priory employees were hard at work preparing the funeral dinner. Smoke was rising from the bakery, where dozens of long four-pound loaves of wheat bread were already in the oven. Two men were rolling a new barrel of wine across to the prior's house. Several novice nuns were setting up benches and a trestle table on the green for the common mourners.

As the sun rose beyond the river, throwing a slanting yellow light on the rooftops of Kingsbridge, Caris studied the marks made on the town by nine months of plague. From this height she could see gaps in the rows of houses, like bad teeth. Timber buildings collapsed all the time, of course - because of fire, rain damage, incompetent construction, or just old age. What was different now was that no one bothered to repair them. If your house fell down, you just moved into one of the empty homes in the same street. The only person building anything was Merthin, and he was seen as a mad optimist with too much money.

Across the river, the gravediggers were already at work in another newly consecrated cemetery. The plague showed no signs of relenting. Where would it end? Would the houses just continue to fall down, one at a time, until there was nothing left, and the town was a wasteland of broken tiles and scorched timbers, with a deserted cathedral in the middle and a hundred-acre graveyard at its edge?

'I'm not going to let this happen,' she said.

Merthin did not at first understand. 'The funeral?' he said, frowning.

Caris made a sweeping gesture to take in the city and the world beyond it. 'Everything. Drunks maiming one another. Parents abandoning their sick children on the doorstep of my hospital. Men queuing to fuck a drunken woman on a table outside the White Horse. Livestock dying in the pastures. Half-naked penitents whipping themselves then collecting pennies from bystanders. And, most of all, a young mother brutally murdered here in my nunnery. I don't care if we are all going to die of the plague. As long as we're still alive, I'm not going to let our world fall apart.'

'What are you going to do?'

She smiled gratefully at Merthin. Most people would have told her she was powerless to fight the situation, but he was always ready to believe in her. She looked at the stone angels carved on a pinnacle, their faces blurred by two hundred years of wind and rain, and she thought of the spirit that had moved the cathedral builders. 'We're going to reestablish order and routine here. We're going to force Kingsbridge people to return to normal, whether they like it or not. We're going to rebuild this town and its life, despite the plague.'

'All right,' he said.

'This is the moment to do it.'

'Because everyone is so angry about Tilly?'

'And because they're frightened at the thought that armed men can come into the town at night and murder whomever they will. They think no one's safe.'

'What will you do?'

'I'm going to tell them it must never happen again.'





'This must never happen again!' she cried, and her voice rang out across the graveyard and echoed off the ancient gray walls of the cathedral.

A woman could never speak out as part of a service in church, but the graveside ceremony was a gray area, a solemn moment that took place outside the church, a time when laypeople such as the family of the deceased would sometimes make speeches or pray aloud.

All the same, Caris was sticking her neck out. Bishop Henri was officiating, backed up by Archdeacon Lloyd and Canon Claude. Lloyd had been diocesan clerk for decades, and Claude was a colleague of Henri's from France. In such distinguished clerical company, it was audacious for a nun to make an unscheduled speech.

Such considerations had never meant much to Caris, of course.

She spoke just as the small coffin was being lowered into the grave. Several of the congregation had begun to cry. The crowd was at least five hundred strong, but they fell silent at the sound of her voice.

'Armed men have come into our town at night and killed a young woman in the nunnery - and I will not stand for it,' she said.

There was a rumble of assent from the crowd.

She raised her voice. 'The priory will not stand for it - the bishop will not stand for it - and the men and women of Kingsbridge will not stand for it!'

The support became louder, the crowd shouting: 'No!' and 'Amen!'

'People say the plague is sent by God. I say that when God sends rain we take shelter. When God sends winter, we build up the fire. When God sends weeds, we pull them up by the roots. We must defend ourselves!'

She glanced at Bishop Henri. He was looking bemused. He had had no warning of this sermon, and if he had been asked for his permission he would have refused it; but he could tell that Caris had the people on her side, and he did not have the nerve to intervene.

'What can we do?'

She looked around. All faces were turned to her expectantly. They had no idea what to do, but they wanted a solution from her. They would cheer at anything she said, if only it gave them hope.

'We must rebuild the city wall!' she cried.

They roared their approval.

'A new wall that is taller, and stronger, and longer than the broken-down old one.' She caught the eye of Ralph. 'A wall that will keep murderers out!'

The crowd shouted: 'Yes!' Ralph looked away.

'And we must elect a new constable, and a force of deputies and sentries, to uphold the law and enforce good behavior.'

'Yes!'

'There will be a meeting of the parish guild tonight to work out the practical details, and the guild's decisions will be announced in church next Sunday. Thank you and God bless you all.'





At the funeral banquet, in the grand dining hall of the prior's palace, Bishop Henri sat at the head of the table. On his right was Lady Philippa, the widowed countess of Shiring. Next to her was seated the chief mourner, Tilly's widower, Sir Ralph Fitzgerald.

Ralph was delighted to be next to Philippa. He could stare at her breasts while she concentrated on her food, and every time she leaned forward he could peek down the square neckline of her light summer dress. She did not know it yet, but the time was not far away when he would command her to take off her clothes and stand naked in front of him, and he would see those magnificent breasts in their entirety.

The dinner provided by Caris was ample but not extravagant, he noted. There were no gilded swans or towers of sugar, but there was plenty of roasted meat, boiled fish, new bread, beans, and spring berries. He helped Philippa to some soup made of ground chicken with almond milk.

She said to him gravely: 'This is a terrible tragedy. You have my most profound sympathy.'

People had been so compassionate that sometimes, for a few moments, Ralph thought of himself as the pitiable victim of a dreadful bereavement, and forgot that he was the one who had slid the knife into Tilly's young heart. 'Thank you,' he said solemnly. 'Tilly was so young. But we soldiers get used to sudden death. One day a man will save your life, and swear eternal friendship and loyalty; and the next day he is struck down by a crossbow bolt through the heart, and you forget him.'

She gave him an odd look that reminded him of the way Sir Gregory had regarded him, with a mixture of curiosity and distaste, and he wondered what it was about his attitude to Tilly's death that provoked this reaction.

Philippa said: 'You have a baby boy.'

'Gerry. The nuns are looking after him today, but I'll take him home to Tench Hall tomorrow. I've found a wet nurse.' He saw an opportunity to drop a hint. 'Of course, he needs someone to mother him properly.'

'Yes.'

He recalled her own bereavement. 'But you know what it is to lose your spouse.'

'I was fortunate to have my beloved William for twenty-one years.'

'You must be lonely.' This might not be the moment to propose, but he thought to edge the conversation toward the subject.

'Indeed. I lost my three men - William and our two sons. The castle seems so empty.'

'But not for long, perhaps.'

She stared at him as if she could not believe her ears, and he realized he had said something offensive. She turned away and spoke to Bishop Henri on her other side.

On Ralph's right was Philippa's daughter, Odila. 'Would you like some of this pasty?' he said to her. 'It's made with peacocks and hares.' She nodded, and he cut her a slice. 'How old are you?' he asked.

'I'll be fifteen this year.'

She was tall, and had her mother's figure already, a full bosom and wide, womanly hips. 'You seem older,' he said, looking at her breasts.

He intended it as a compliment - young people generally wanted to seem older - but she blushed and looked away.

Ralph looked down at his trencher and speared a chunk of pork cooked with ginger. He ate it moodily. He was not very good at what Gregory called wooing.





Caris was seated on the left of Bishop Henri, with Merthin, as alderman, on her other side. Next to Merthin was Sir Gregory Longfellow, who had come for the funeral of Earl William three months ago and had not yet left the neighborhood. Caris had to suppress her disgust at being at a table with the murdering Ralph and the man who had, almost certainly, put him up to it. But she had work to do at this dinner. She had a plan for the revival of the town. Rebuilding the walls was only the first part. For the second, she had to get Bishop Henri on her side.

She poured the bishop a goblet of clear red Gascon wine, and he took a long draft. He wiped his mouth and said: 'You preach a good sermon.'

'Thank you,' she said, noting the ironic reproof that underlay his compliment. 'Life in this town is degenerating into disorder and debauchery, and if we're to put it right we need to inspire the townspeople. I'm sure you agree.'

'It's a little late to ask whether I agree with you. However, I do.' Henri was a pragmatist who did not re-fight lost battles. She had been counting on that.

She served herself some heron roasted with pepper and cloves, but did not begin to eat: she had too much to say. 'There's more to my plan than the walls and the constabulary.'

'I thought there might be.'

'I believe that you, as the bishop of Kingsbridge, should have the tallest cathedral in England.'

He raised his eyebrows. 'I wasn't expecting that.'

'Two hundred years ago this was one of England's most important priories. It should be so again. A new church tower would symbolize the revival - and your eminence among bishops.'

He smiled wryly, but he was pleased. He knew he was being flattered, and he liked it.

Caris said: 'The tower would also serve the town. Being visible from a distance, it would help pilgrims and traders find their way here.'

'How would you pay for it?'

'The priory is wealthy.'

He was surprised again. 'Prior Godwyn complained of money problems.'

'He was a hopeless manager.'

'He struck me as rather competent.'

'He struck a lot of people that way, but he made all the wrong decisions. Right at the start he refused to repair the fulling mill, which would have brought him an income; but he spent money on this palace, which returned him nothing.'

'And how have things changed?'

'I've sacked most of the bailiffs and replaced them with younger men who are willing to make changes. I've converted about half the land to grazing, which is easier to manage in these times of labor shortage. The rest I've leased for cash rents with no customary obligations. And we've all benefited from inheritance taxes and from the legacies of people who died without heirs because of the plague. The monastery is now as rich as the nunnery.'

'So all the tenants are free?'

'Most. Instead of working one day a week on the demesne farm, and carting the landlord's hay, and folding their sheep on the landlord's field, and all those complicated services, they just pay money. They like it better and it certainly makes our life simpler.'

'A lot of landlords - abbots especially - revile that type of tenancy. They say it ruins the peasantry.'

Caris shrugged. 'What have we lost? The power to impose petty variations, favoring some serfs and persecuting others, keeping them all subservient. Monks and nuns have no business tyrannizing peasants. Farmers know what crops to sow and what they can sell at market. They work better left to themselves.'

The bishop looked suspicious. 'So you feel the priory can pay for a new tower?'

He had been expecting her to ask him for money, she guessed. 'Yes - with some assistance from the town's merchants. And that's where you can help us.'

'I thought there must be something.'

'I'm not asking you for money. What I want from you is worth more than money.'

'I'm intrigued.'

'I want to apply to the king for a borough charter.' As she said the words, Caris felt her hands begin to shake. She was taken back to the battle she had fought with Godwyn, ten years ago, that had ended in her being accused of witchcraft. The issue then had been the borough charter, and she had nearly died fighting for it. Circumstances now were completely different, but the charter was no less important. She put down her eating knife and clasped her hands together in her lap to keep them still.

'I see,' said Henri noncommittally.

Caris swallowed hard and went on. 'It's essential for the regeneration of the town's commercial life. For a long time Kingsbridge has been held back by the dead hand of priory rule. Priors are cautious and conservative, and instinctively say no to any change or innovation. Merchants live by change - they're always looking for new ways to make money, or at least the good ones are. If we want the men of Kingsbridge to help pay for our new tower, we must give them the freedom they need to prosper.'

'A borough charter.'

'The town would have its own court, set its own regulations, and be ruled by a proper guild, rather than the parish guild we have now, which has no real power.'

'But would the king grant it?'

'Kings like boroughs, which pay lots of taxes. But, in the past, the prior of Kingsbridge has always opposed a charter.'

'You think priors are too conservative.'

'Timid.'

'Well,' said the bishop with a laugh, 'timidity is a thing you'll never be accused of.'

Caris pressed her point. 'I think a charter is essential if we're to build the new tower.'

'Yes, I can see that.'

'So, do you agree?'

'To the tower, or the charter?'

'They go together.'

Henri seemed amused. 'Are you making a deal with me, Mother Caris?'

'If you're willing.'

'All right. Build me a tower, and I'll help you get a charter.'

'No. It has to be the other way around. We need the charter first.'

'So I must trust you.'

'Is that difficult?'

'To be honest, no.'

'Good. Then we're agreed.'

'Yes.'

Caris leaned forward and looked past Merthin. 'Sir Gregory?'

'Yes, Mother Caris?'

She forced herself to be polite to him. 'Have you tried this rabbit in sugar gravy? I recommend it.'

Gregory accepted the bowl and took some. 'Thank you.'

Caris said to him: 'You will recall that Kingsbridge is not a borough.'

'I certainly do.' Gregory had used that fact, more than a decade ago, to outmaneuver Caris in the royal court in the dispute over the fulling mill.

'The bishop thinks it's time for us to ask the king for a charter.'

Gregory nodded. 'I believe the king might look favorably on such a plea - especially if it were presented to him in the right way.'

Hoping that her distaste was not showing on her face, she said: 'Perhaps you would be kind enough to advise us.'

'May we discuss this in more detail later?'

Gregory would require a bribe, of course, though he would undoubtedly call it a lawyer's fee. 'By all means,' she said, repressing a shudder.

The servants began clearing away the food. Caris looked down at her trencher. She had not eaten anything.





'Our families are related,' Ralph was saying to Lady Philippa. 'Not closely, of course,' he added hastily. 'But my father is descended from that earl of Shiring who was the son of Lady Aliena and Jack Builder.' He looked across the table at his brother Merthin, the alderman. 'I think I inherited the blood of the earls, and my brother that of the builders.'

He looked at Philippa's face to see how she took that. She did not seem impressed.

'I was brought up in the household of your late father-in-law, Earl Roland,' he went on.

'I remember you as a squire.'

'I served under the earl in the king's army in France. At the battle of CrÃ©cy, I saved the life of the prince of Wales.'

'My goodness, how splendid,' she said politely.

He was trying to get her to see him as an equal, so that it would seem more natural when he told her that she was to be his wife. But he did not appear to be getting through to her. She just looked bored and a bit puzzled by the direction of his conversation.

The dessert was served: sugared strawberries, honey wafers, dates and raisins, and spiced wine. Ralph drained a cup of wine and poured more, hoping that the drink would help him relax with Philippa. He was not sure why he found it difficult to talk to her. Because this was his wife's funeral? Because Philippa was a countess? Or because he had been hopelessly in love with her for years, and could not believe that now, at last, she really was to be his wife?

'When you leave here, will you go back to Earlscastle?' he asked her.

'Yes. We depart tomorrow.'

'Will you stay there long?'

'Where else would I go?' She frowned. 'Why do you ask?'

'I will come and visit you there, if I may.'

Her response was frosty. 'To what end?'

'I want to discuss with you a subject that it would not be appropriate to raise here and now.'

'What on earth do you mean?'

'I'll come and see you in the next few days.'

She looked agitated. In a raised voice she said: 'What could you possibly have to say to me?'

'As I said, it wouldn't be appropriate to speak of it today.'

'Because this is your wife's funeral?'

He nodded.

She went pale. 'Oh, my God,' she said. 'You can't mean to suggest...'

'I told you, I don't want to discuss it now.'

'But I must know!' she cried. 'Are you planning to propose marriage to me?'

He hesitated, shrugged, and then nodded.

'But on what grounds?' she said. 'Surely you need the king's permission!'

He looked at her and raised his eyebrows briefly.

She stood up suddenly. 'No!' she said. Everyone around the table looked at her. She stared at Gregory. 'Is this true?' she said. 'Is the king going to marry me to him?' She jerked a thumb contemptuously at Ralph.

Ralph felt stabbed. He had not expected her to display such revulsion. Was he so repellent?

Gregory looked reproachfully at Ralph. 'This was not the moment to raise the matter.'

Philippa cried: 'So it's true! God save me!'

Ralph caught Odila's eye. She was staring at him in horror. What had he ever done to earn her dislike?

Philippa said: 'I can't bear it.'

'Why?' Ralph said. 'What is so wrong? What right have you to look down on me and my family?' He looked around at the company: his brother, his ally Gregory, the bishop, the prioress, minor noblemen, and leading citizens. They were all silent, shocked and intrigued by Philippa's outburst.

Philippa ignored his question. Addressing Gregory, she said: 'I will not do it! I will not, do you hear me?' She was white with rage, but tears ran down her cheeks. Ralph thought how beautiful she was, even while she was rejecting and humiliating him so painfully.

Gregory said coolly: 'It is not your decision, Lady Philippa, and it certainly is not mine. The king will do as he pleases.'

'You may force me into a wedding dress, and you may march me up the aisle,' Philippa raged. She pointed at Bishop Henri. 'But when the bishop asks me if I take Ralph Fitzgerald to be my husband I will not say yes! I will not! Never, never, never!'

She stormed out of the room, and Odila followed.





When the banquet was over, the townspeople returned to their homes, and the important guests went to their rooms to sleep off the feast. Caris supervised the clearing up. She felt sorry for Philippa, profoundly sorry, knowing - as Philippa did not - that Ralph had killed his first wife. But she was concerned about the fate of an entire town, not just one person. Her mind was on her scheme for Kingsbridge. Things had gone better than she had imagined. The townspeople had cheered her, and the bishop had agreed to everything she proposed. Perhaps civilization would return to Kingsbridge, despite the plague.

Outside the back door, where there was a pile of meat bones and crusts of bread, she saw Godwyn's cat, Archbishop, delicately picking at the carcass of a duck. She shooed it away. It scampered a few yards then slowed to a stiff walk, its white-tipped tail arrogantly upstanding.

Deep in thought, she went up the stairs of the palace, thinking of how she would begin implementing the changes agreed to by Henri. Without pausing, she opened the door of the bedroom she shared with Merthin and stepped inside.

For a moment she was disoriented. Two men stood in the middle of the room, and she thought, I must be in the wrong house, and then I must be in the wrong room, before she remembered that her room, being the best bedroom, had naturally been given to the bishop.

The two men were Henri and his assistant, Canon Claude. It took Caris a moment to realize that they were both naked, with their arms around one another, kissing.

She stared at them in shock. 'Oh!' she said.

They had not heard the door. Until she spoke, they did not realize they were observed. When they heard her gasp of surprise, they both turned toward her. A look of horrified guilt came over Henri's face, and his mouth fell open.

'I'm sorry!' Caris said.

The men sprang apart, as if hoping they might be able to deny what was going on; then they remembered they were naked. Henri was plump, with a round belly and fat arms and legs, and gray hair on his chest. Claude was younger and slimmer, with very little body hair except for a blaze of chestnut at his groin. Caris had never before looked at two erect penises at the same time.

'I beg your pardon!' she said, mortified with embarrassment. 'My mistake. I forgot.' She realized that she was babbling and they were dumbstruck. It did not matter: nothing that anyone could say would make the situation any better.

Coming to her senses, she backed out of the room and slammed the door.





Merthin walked away from the banquet with Madge Webber. He was fond of this small, chunky woman, with her chin jutting out in front and her bottom jutting out behind. He admired the way she had carried on after her husband and children had died of the plague. She had continued the enterprise, weaving cloth and dyeing it red according to Caris's recipe. She said to him: 'Good for Caris. She's right, as usual. We can't go on like this.'

'You've continued normally, despite everything,' he said.

'My only problem is finding the people to do the work.'

'Everyone is the same. I can't get builders.'

'Raw wool is cheap, but rich people will still pay high prices for good scarlet cloth,' Madge said. 'I could sell more if I could produce more.'

Merthin said thoughtfully: 'You know, I saw a faster type of loom in Florence - a treadle loom.'

'Oh?' She looked at him with alert curiosity. 'I never heard of that.'

He wondered how to explain. 'In any loom, you stretch a number of threads over the frame to form what you call the warp, then you weave another thread crossways through the warp, under one thread and over the next, under and over, from one side to the other and back again, to form the weft.'

'That's how simple looms work, yes. Ours are better.'

'I know. To make the process quicker, you attach every second warp thread to a movable bar, called a heddle, so that when you shift the heddle, half the threads are lifted away from the rest. Then, instead of going over and under, over and under, you can simply pass the weft thread straight through the gap in one easy movement. Then you drop the heddle below the warp for the return pass.'

'Yes. By the way, the weft thread is wound on a bobbin.'

'Each time you pass the bobbin through the warp from left to right, you have to put it down, then use both hands to move the heddle, then pick up the bobbin again and bring it back from right to left.'

'Exactly.'

'In a treadle loom, you move the heddle with your feet. So you never have to put the bobbin down.'

'Really? My soul!'

'That would make a difference, wouldn't it?'

'A huge difference. You could weave twice as much - more!'

'That's what I thought. Shall I build one for you to try?'

'Yes, please!'

'I don't remember exactly how it was constructed. I think the treadle operated a system of pulleys and levers...' He frowned, thinking. 'Anyway, I'm sure I can figure it out.'





Late in the afternoon, as Caris was passing the library, she met Canon Claude coming out, carrying a small book. He caught her eye and stopped. They both immediately thought of the scene Caris had stumbled upon an hour ago. At first Claude looked embarrassed, but then a grin lifted the corners of his mouth. His put his hand to his face to cover it, obviously feeling it was wrong to be amused. Caris remembered how startled the two naked men had been and she, too, felt inappropriate laughter bubbling up inside her. On impulse, she said what was in her mind: 'The two of you did look funny!' Claude giggled despite himself, and Caris could not help chuckling too, and they made each other worse, until they fell into one another's arms, tears streaming down their cheeks, helpless with laughter.





That evening, Caris took Merthin to the southwest corner of the priory grounds, where the vegetable garden grew alongside the river. The air was mild, and the moist earth gave up a fragrance of new growth. Caris could see spring onions and radishes. 'So, your brother is to be the earl of Shiring,' she said.

'Not if Lady Philippa has anything to do with it.'

'A countess has to do what she is told by the king, doesn't she?'

'All women should be subservient to men, in theory,' Merthin said with a grin. 'Some defy convention, though.'

'I can't think who you mean.'

Merthin's mood changed abruptly. 'What a world,' he said. 'A man murders his wife, and the king elevates him to the highest rank of the nobility.'

'We know these things happen,' she said. 'But it's shocking when it's your own family. Poor Tilly.'

Merthin rubbed his eyes as if to erase visions. 'Why have you brought me here?'

'To talk about the final element in my plan: the new hospital.'

'Ah. I was wondering...'

'Could you build it here?'

Merthin looked around. 'I don't see why not. It's a sloping site, but the entire priory is built on a slope, and we're not talking about putting up another cathedral. One story or two?'

'One. But I want the building divided into medium-size rooms, each containing just four or six beds, so that diseases don't spread so quickly from one patient to everyone else in the place. It must have its own pharmacy - a large, well-lit room - for the preparation of medicines, with a herb garden outside. And a spacious, airy latrine with piped water, very easy to keep clean. In fact the whole building must have lots of light and space. But, most importantly, it has to be at least a hundred yards from the rest of the priory. We have to separate the sick from the well. That's the key feature.'

'I'll do some drawings in the morning.'

She glanced around and, seeing that they were not observed, she kissed him. 'This is going to be the culmination of my life's work, do you realize that?'

'You're thirty-two - isn't it a little early to be talking about the culmination of your life's work?'

'It hasn't happened yet.'

'It won't take long. I'll start on it while I'm digging the foundations for the new tower. Then, as soon as the hospital is built, I can switch my masons to work on the cathedral.'

They started to walk back. She could tell that his real enthusiasm was for the tower. 'How tall will it be?'

'Four hundred and five feet.'

'How high is Salisbury?'

'Four hundred and four.'

'So it will be the highest building in England.'

'Until someone builds a higher one, yes.'

So he would achieve his ambition too, she thought. She put her arm through his as they walked to the prior's palace. She felt happy. That was strange, wasn't it? Thousands of Kingsbridge people had died of the plague, and Tilly had been murdered, but Caris felt hopeful. It was because she had a plan, of course. She always felt better when she had a plan. The new walls, the constabulary, the tower, the borough charter, and most of all the new hospital: how would she find time to organize it all?

Arm in arm with Merthin, she walked into the prior's house. Bishop Henri and Sir Gregory were there, deep in conversation with a third man who had his back to Caris. There was something unpleasantly familiar about the newcomer, even from behind, and Caris felt a tremor of unease. Then he turned around and she saw his face: sardonic, triumphant, sneering, and full of malice.

It was Philemon.
