When Merthin and Caris returned from Shiring to Kingsbridge, they found that Lolla had gone missing.

Their long-standing house servants, Arn and Em, were waiting at the garden gate, and looked as if they had been stationed there all day. Em began to speak but burst into incoherent sobs, and Arn had to break the news. 'We can't find Lolla,' he said, distraught. 'We don't know where she is.'

At first Merthin misunderstood. 'She'll be here by suppertime,' he said. 'Don't upset yourself, Em.'

'But she didn't come home last night, nor the night before,' Arn said.

Merthin realized then what they meant. She had run away. A blast of fear like a winter wind chilled his skin and gripped his heart. She was only sixteen. For a moment he could not think rationally. He just pictured her, halfway between child and adult, with the intense dark-brown eyes and sensual mouth of her mother, and an expression of blithe false confidence.

When rationality returned to him, he asked himself what had gone wrong. He had been leaving Lolla in the care of Arn and Em for a few days at a time ever since she was five years old, and she had never come to any harm. Had something changed?

He realized that he had hardly spoken to her since Easter Sunday, two weeks ago, when he had taken her by the arm and pulled her away from her disreputable friends outside the White Horse. She had sulked upstairs while the family ate dinner, and had not emerged even when Sam was arrested. She had still been in a snit a few days later, when Merthin and Caris had kissed her good-bye and set out for Shiring.

Guilt stabbed him. He had treated her harshly, and driven her away. Was Silvia's ghost watching, and despising him for his failure to care for their daughter?

The thought of Lolla's disreputable friends came back to him. 'That fellow Jake Riley is behind this,' he said. 'Have you spoken to him, Arn?'

'No, master.'

'I'd better do that right away. Do you know where he lives?'

'He lodges next to the fishmonger's behind St. Paul's Church.'

Caris said to Merthin: 'I'll go with you.'

They crossed the bridge back into the city and headed west. The parish of St. Paul took in the industrial premises along the waterfront: abattoirs, leather tanners, sawmills, manufactories, and the dyers that had sprung up like September mushrooms since the invention of Kingsbridge Scarlet. Merthin headed for the squat tower of St. Paul's Church, visible over the low roofs of the houses. He found the fish shop by smell, and knocked at a large, run-down house next door.

It was opened by Sal Sawyers, poor widow of a jobbing carpenter who had died in the plague. 'Jake comes and goes, Alderman,' she said. 'I haven't seen him for a week. He can do as he pleases, so long as he pays the rent.'

Caris said: 'When he left, was Lolla with him?'

Sal warily looked sideways at Merthin. 'I don't like to criticize,' she said.

Merthin said: 'Please just tell me what you know. I won't be offended.'

'She's usually with him. She does anything Jake wants, I'll say no more than that. If you look for him, you'll find her.'

'Do you know where he might have gone?'

'He never says.'

'Can you think of anyone who might know?'

'He doesn't bring his friends here, except for her. But I believe his pals are usually to be found at the White Horse.'

Merthin nodded. 'We'll try there. Thank you, Sal.'

'She'll be all right,' Sal said. 'She's just going through a wild phase.'

'I hope you're right.'

Merthin and Caris retraced their steps until they came to the White Horse, on the riverside near the bridge. Merthin recalled the orgy he had witnessed here at the height of the plague, when the dying Davey Whitehorse had given away all his ale. The place had stood empty for several years afterward, but now it was once again a busy tavern. Merthin often wondered why it was popular. The rooms were cramped and dirty, and there were frequent fights. About once a year someone was killed there.

They went into a smoky parlor. It was mid-afternoon, but there were a dozen or so desultory drinkers sitting on benches. A small group was clustered around a backgammon board, and several small piles of silver pennies on the table indicated that money was being wagered on the outcome. A red-cheeked prostitute called Joy looked up hopefully at the newcomers, then saw who they were and relapsed into bored indolence. In a corner, a man was showing a woman an expensive-looking coat, apparently offering it for sale; but when he saw Merthin he folded the garment quickly and put it out of sight, and Merthin guessed it was stolen property.

The landlord, Evan, was eating a late dinner of fried bacon. He stood up, wiping his hands on his tunic, and said nervously: 'Good day to you, Alderman - an honor to have you in the house. May I draw you a pot of ale?'

'I'm looking for my daughter, Lolla,' Merthin said briskly.

'I haven't seen her for a week,' said Evan.

Sal had said exactly the same about Jake, Merthin recalled. He said to Evan: 'She may be with Jake Riley.'

'Yes, I've noticed that they're friendly,' Evan said tactfully. 'He's been gone about the same length of time.'

'Do you know where he went?'

'He's a close-lipped type, is Jake,' said Evan. 'If you asked him how far it was to Shiring, he'd shake his head and frown and say it was none of his business to know such things.'

The whore, Joy, had been listening to the conversation, and now she chipped in. 'He's openhanded, though,' she said. 'Fair's fair.'

Merthin gave her a hard look. 'And where does his money come from?'

'Horses,' she said. 'He goes around the villages buying foals from peasants, and sells them in the towns.'

He probably stole horses from unwary travelers, too, Merthin thought sourly. 'Is that what he's doing now - buying horses?'

Evan said: 'Very likely. The big fair season is coming up. He could be acquiring his stock-in-trade.'

'And perhaps Lolla went with him.'

'Not wishing to give offense, Alderman, but it's quite likely.'

'It's not you who has given offense,' Merthin said. He nodded a curt farewell and left the tavern, with Caris following.

'That's what she's done,' he said angrily. 'She's gone off with Jake. She probably thinks it's a great adventure.'

'I'm afraid I think you're right,' Caris said. 'I hope she doesn't become pregnant.'

'I wish that was the worst I feared.'

They headed automatically for home. Crossing the bridge, Merthin stopped at the highest point and looked out over the suburban rooftops to the forest beyond. His little girl was somewhere out there with a shady horse dealer. She was in danger, and there was nothing he could do to protect her.





When Merthin went to the cathedral the next morning, to check on the new tower, he found that all work had stopped. 'Prior's orders,' said Brother Thomas when Merthin questioned him. Thomas was almost sixty years old, and showing his age. His soldierly physique was bent, and he shuffled around the precincts unsteadily. 'There's been a collapse in the south aisle,' he added.

Merthin glanced at Bartelmy French, a gnarled old mason from Normandy, who was sitting outside the lodge sharpening a chisel. Bartelmy shook his head in silent negation.

'That collapse was twenty-four years ago, Brother Thomas,' Merthin said.

'Ah, yes, you're right,' said Thomas. 'My memory's not as good as it used to be, you know.'

Merthin patted his shoulder. 'We're all getting older.'

Bartelmy said: 'The prior is up the tower, if you want to see him.'

Merthin certainly did. He went into the north transept, stepped through a small archway, and climbed a narrow spiral stair within the wall. As he passed from the old crossing into the new tower, the color of the stones changed from the dark gray of storm clouds to the light pearl of the morning sky. It was a long climb: the tower was already more than three hundred feet high. However, he was used to it. Almost every day for eleven years he had climbed a stair that was higher each time. It occurred to him that Philemon, who was quite fat nowadays, must have had a compelling reason to drag his bulk up all these steps.

Near the top, Merthin passed through a chamber that housed the great wheel, a wooden winding mechanism twice as high as a man, used for hoisting stones, mortar, and timber up to where they were needed. When the spire was finished the wheel would be left here permanently, to be used for repair work by future generations of builders, until the trumpets sounded on the Day of Judgment.

He emerged on top of the tower. A stiff, cold breeze was blowing, though none had been noticeable at ground level. A leaded walkway ran around the inside of the tower's summit. Scaffolding stood around an octagonal hole, ready for the masons who would build the spire. Dressed stones were piled nearby, and a heap of mortar was drying up wastefully on a wooden board.

There were no workmen here. Prior Philemon stood on the far side with Harold Mason. They were deep in conversation, but stopped guiltily when Merthin came into view. He had to shout into the wind to make himself heard. 'Why have you stopped the building?'

Philemon had his answer ready. 'There's a problem with your design.'

Merthin looked at Harold. 'You mean some people can't understand it.'

'Experienced people say it can't be built,' Philemon said defiantly.

'Experienced people?' Merthin repeated scornfully. 'Who in Kingsbridge is experienced? Who has built a bridge? Who has worked with the great architects of Florence? Who has seen Rome, Avignon, Paris, Rouen? Certainly not Harold here. No offense, Harold, but you've never even been to London.'

Harold said: 'I'm not the only one who thinks it's impossible to build an octagonal tower with no formwork.'

Merthin was about to say something sarcastic, but stopped himself. Philemon must have more than this, he realized. The prior had deliberately chosen to fight this battle. Therefore he must have weapons more formidable than the mere opinion of Harold Mason. He had presumably won some support among members of the guild - but how? Other builders who were prepared to say that Merthin's spire was impossible must have been offered some incentive. That probably meant construction work for them. 'What is it?' he said to Philemon. 'What are you hoping to build?'

'I don't know what you mean,' Philemon blustered.

'You've got an alternative project, and you've offered Harold and his friends a piece of it. What's the building?'

'You don't know what you're talking about.'

'A bigger palace for yourself? A new chapter house? It can't be a hospital, we've already got three. Come on, you might as well tell me. Unless you're ashamed of it.'

Philemon was stung into a response. 'The monks wish to build a Lady chapel.'

'Ah.' That made sense. The cult of the Virgin was increasingly popular. The church hierarchy approved because the wave of piety associated with Mary counterbalanced the skepticism and heresy that had afflicted congregations since the plague. Numerous cathedrals and churches were adding a special small chapel at the east end - the holiest part of the building - dedicated to the Mother of God. Merthin did not like the architecture: on most churches, a Lady chapel looked like an afterthought, which of course it was.

What was Philemon's motive? He was always trying to ingratiate himself with someone - that was his modus operandi. A Lady chapel at Kingsbridge would undoubtedly please conservative senior clergy.

This was the second move Philemon had made in that direction. On Easter Sunday, from the pulpit of the cathedral, he had condemned dissection of corpses. He was mounting a campaign, Merthin realized. But what was its purpose?

Merthin decided to do nothing more until he had figured out what Philemon was up to. Without saying anything further, he left the roof and started down the series of staircases and ladders to the ground.

Merthin arrived home at the dinner hour, and Caris came in from the hospital a few minutes later. 'Brother Thomas is getting worse,' he said to Caris. 'Is there anything that can be done for him?'

She shook her head. 'There's no cure for senility.'

'He told me the south aisle had collapsed as if it had happened yesterday.'

'That's typical. He remembers the distant past but doesn't know what's going on today. Poor Thomas. He'll probably deteriorate quite fast. But at least he's in a familiar place. Monasteries don't change much over the decades. His daily routine is probably the same as it has always been. That will help.'

As they sat down to mutton stew with leeks and mint, Merthin explained the morning's developments. The two of them had been battling Kingsbridge priors for decades: first Anthony, then Godwyn, and now Philemon. They had thought that the granting of the borough charter would put an end to the constant jockeying. It had certainly improved matters, but it seemed Philemon had not given up yet.

'I'm not really worried about the spire,' Merthin said. 'Bishop Henri will overrule Philemon, and order the building restarted, just as soon as he hears. Henri wants to be bishop of the tallest cathedral in England.'

'Philemon must know that,' Caris said thoughtfully.

'Perhaps he simply wants to make the gesture toward a Lady chapel, and get the credit for trying, while blaming his failure on someone else.'

'Perhaps,' Caris said doubtfully.

In Merthin's mind there was a more important question. 'But what is he really after?'

'Everything Philemon does is driven by the need to make himself feel important,' Caris said confidently. 'My guess is he's after a promotion.'

'What job could he have in mind? The archbishop of Monmouth seems to be dying, but surely Philemon can't hope for that position?'

'He must know something we don't.'

Before they could say any more, Lolla walked in.

Merthin's first reaction was a feeling of relief so powerful that it brought tears to his eyes. She was back, and she was safe. He looked her up and down. She had no apparent injuries, she walked with a spring in her step, and her face showed only the usual expression of moody discontent.

Caris spoke first. 'You're back!' she said. 'I'm so glad!'

'Are you?' Lolla said. She often pretended to believe that Caris did not like her. Merthin was not fooled, but Caris could be thrown into doubt, for she was sensitive about not being Lolla's mother.

'We're both glad,' Merthin said. 'You gave us a scare.'

'Why?' said Lolla. She hung her cloak on a hook and sat at the table. 'I was perfectly all right.'

'But we didn't know that, so we were terribly worried.'

'You shouldn't be,' Lolla said. 'I can take care of myself.'

Merthin suppressed an angry retort. 'I'm not sure you can,' he said as mildly as possible.

Caris stepped in to try to lower the temperature. 'Where did you go?' she asked. 'You've been away for two weeks.'

'Different places.'

Merthin said tightly: 'Can you give us one or two examples?'

'Mudeford Crossing. Casterham. Outhenby.'

'And what have you been doing?'

'Is this the catechism?' she said petulantly. 'Do I have to answer all these questions?'

Caris put a restraining hand on Merthin's arm and said to Lolla: 'We just want to know that you haven't been in danger.'

Merthin said: 'I'd also like to know who you've been traveling with.'

'Nobody special.'

'Does that mean Jake Riley?'

She shrugged and looked embarrassed. 'Yes,' she said, as if it were a trivial detail.

Merthin had been ready to forgive and embrace her, but she was making that difficult. Trying to keep his voice neutral, he said: 'What sleeping arrangements did you and Jake have?'

'That's my business!' she cried.

'No, it's not!' he shouted back. 'It's mine, too, and your stepmother's. If you're pregnant, who will care for your baby? Are you confident that Jake is ready to settle down and be a husband and father? Have you talked to him about that?'

'Don't speak to me!' she yelled. Then she burst into tears and stomped up the stairs.

Merthin said: 'Sometimes I wish we lived in one room - then she wouldn't be able to pull that trick.'

'You weren't very gentle with her,' Caris said with mild disapproval.

'What am I supposed to do?' Merthin said. 'She talks as if she's done nothing wrong!'

'She knows the truth, though. That's why she's crying.'

'Oh, hell,' he said.

There was a knock, and a novice monk put his head around the door. 'Pardon me for disturbing you, Alderman,' he said. 'Sir Gregory Longfellow is at the priory, and would be grateful for a word with you, as soon as is convenient.'

'Damn,' said Merthin. 'Tell him I'll be there in a few minutes.'

'Thank you,' the novice said, and left.

Merthin said to Caris: 'Perhaps it's just as well to give her time to cool off.'

'You, too,' Caris said.

'You're not taking her side, are you?' he said with a touch of irritation.

She smiled and touched his arm. 'I'm on your side, always,' she said. 'But I remember what it was like to be a sixteen-year-old girl. She's as worried as you are about her relationship with Jake. But she's not admitting it, even to herself, because that would wound her pride. So she resents you for speaking the truth. She has constructed a fragile defense around her self-esteem, and you just tear it down.'

'What should I do?'

'Help her build a better fence.'

'I don't know what that means.'

'You'll figure it out.'

'I'd better go and see Sir Gregory.' Merthin stood up.

Caris put her arms around him and kissed him on the lips. 'You're a good man doing your best, and I love you with all my heart,' she said.

That took the edge off his frustration, and he felt himself calm down as he strode across the bridge and up the main street to the priory. He did not like Gregory. The man was sly and unprincipled, willing to do anything for his master the king, just as Philemon had been when he served Godwyn as prior. Merthin wondered uneasily what Gregory wanted to discuss with him. It was probably taxes - always the king's worry.

Merthin went first to the prior's palace where Philemon, looking pleased with himself, told him that Sir Gregory was to be found in the monks' cloisters to the south of the cathedral. Merthin wondered what Gregory had done to win himself the privilege of holding audience there.

The lawyer was getting old. His hair was white, and his tall figure was stooped. Deep lines had appeared like brackets either side of that sneering nose, and one of the blue eyes was cloudy. But the other eye saw sharply enough, and he recognized Merthin instantly, though they had not met for ten years. 'Alderman,' he said. 'The archbishop of Monmouth is dead.'

'Rest his soul,' Merthin said automatically.

'Amen. The king asked me, as I was passing through his borough of Kingsbridge, to give you his greetings, and tell you this important news.'

'I'm grateful. The death is not unexpected. The archbishop has been ill.' The king certainly had not asked Gregory to meet with Merthin purely to give him interesting information, he thought suspiciously.

'You're an intriguing man, if you don't mind my saying so,' Gregory said expansively. 'I first met your wife more than twenty years ago. Since then I've seen the two of you slowly but surely take control of this town. And you've got everything you set your hearts on: the bridge, the hospital, the borough charter, and each other. You're determined, and you're patient.'

It was condescending, but Merthin was surprised to detect a grain of respect in Gregory's flattery. He told himself to remain mistrustful: men such as Gregory praised only for a purpose.

'I'm on my way to see the monks of Abergavenny, who must vote for a new archbishop.' Gregory leaned back in his chair. 'When Christianity first came to England, hundreds of years ago, monks elected their own superiors.' Explaining was an old man's habit, Merthin reflected: the young Gregory would not have bothered. 'Nowadays, of course, bishops and archbishops are too important and powerful to be chosen by small groups of pious idealists living detached from the world. The king makes his choice, and His Holiness the Pope ratifies the royal decision.'

Even I know it's not that simple, Merthin thought. There's usually some kind of power struggle. But he said nothing.

Gregory continued: 'However, the ritual of the monks' election still goes on, and it is easier to control it than to abolish it. Hence my journey.'

'So you're going to tell the monks whom to elect,' Merthin said.

'To put it bluntly, yes.'

'And what name will you give them?'

'Didn't I say? It's your bishop, Henri of Mons. Excellent man: loyal, trustworthy, never makes trouble.'

'Oh, dear.'

'You're not pleased?' Gregory's relaxed air evaporated, and he became keenly attentive.

Merthin realized that this was what Gregory had come for: to find out how the people of Kingsbridge - as represented by Merthin - would feel about what he was planning, and whether they would oppose him. He collected his thoughts. The prospect of a new bishop threatened the spire and the hospital. 'Henri is the key to the balance of power in this town,' he said. 'Ten years ago, a kind of armistice was agreed between the merchants, the monks, and the hospital. As a result, all three have prospered mightily.' Appealing to Gregory's interest - and the king's - he added: 'That prosperity is of course what enables us to pay such high taxes.'

Gregory acknowledged this with a dip of his head.

'The departure of Henri obviously puts into question the stability of our relationships.'

'It depends on who replaces him, I should have thought.'

'Indeed,' said Merthin. Now we come to the crux, he thought. He said: 'Have you got anyone in mind?'

'The obvious candidate is Prior Philemon.'

'No!' Merthin was aghast. 'Philemon! Why?'

'He's a sound conservative, which is important to the church hierarchy in these times of skepticism and heresy.'

'Of course. Now I understand why he preached a sermon against dissection. And why he wants to build a Lady chapel.' I should have foreseen this, Merthin thought

'And he has let it be known that he has no problem with taxation of the clergy - a constant source of friction between the king and some of his bishops.'

'Philemon has been planning this for some time.' Merthin was angry with himself for letting it sneak up on him.

'Since the archbishop fell ill, I imagine.'

'This is a catastrophe.'

'Why do you say that?'

'Philemon is quarrelsome and vengeful. If he becomes bishop he will create constant strife in Kingsbridge. We have to prevent him.' He looked Gregory in the eye. 'Why did you come here to forewarn me?' As soon as he had asked the question, the answer came to him. 'You don't want Philemon either. You didn't need me to tell you what a troublemaker he is - you knew already. But you can't just veto him, because he has already won support among senior clergy.' Gregory just smiled enigmatically - which Merthin took to mean he was right. 'So what do you want me to do?'

'If I were you,' Gregory said, 'I'd start by finding another candidate to put up as the alternative to Philemon.'

So that was it. Merthin nodded pensively. 'I'll have to think about this,' he said.

'Please do.' Gregory stood up, and Merthin realized the meeting was over. 'And let me know what you decide,' Gregory added.

Merthin left the priory and walked back to Leper Island, musing. Who could he propose as bishop of Kingsbridge? The townspeople had always got on well with Archdeacon Lloyd, but he was too old - they might succeed in getting him elected only to have to do the whole thing again in a year's time.

He had not thought of anyone by the time he got home. He found Caris in the parlor and was about to ask her when she preempted him. Standing up, with a pale face and a frightened expression, she said: 'Lolla's gone again.'
