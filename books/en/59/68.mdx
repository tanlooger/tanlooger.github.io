Earlscastle had not changed. Twelve years ago, Merthin recalled, he had been asked to demolish the old fortress and build a new, modern palace fit for an earl in a peaceful country. But he had refused, preferring to design the new bridge at Kingsbridge. Since then, it seemed, the project had languished, for here was the same figure-eight wall, with two drawbridges, and the old-fashioned keep ensconced in the upper loop, where the family lived like frightened rabbits at the end of a burrow, unaware that there was no longer any danger from the fox. The place must have been much the same in the days of Lady Aliena and Jack Builder.

Merthin was with Caris, who had been summoned here by the countess, Lady Philippa. Earl William had fallen sick, and Philippa thought her husband had the plague. Caris had been dismayed. She had thought the plague was over. No one had died of it in Kingsbridge for six weeks.

Caris and Merthin had set out immediately. However, the messenger had taken two days to travel from Earlscastle to Kingsbridge, and they had taken the same time to get here, so the likelihood was that the earl would now be dead, or nearly so. 'All I will be able to do is give him some poppy essence to ease the final agony,' Caris had said as they rode along.

'You do more than that,' Merthin had said. 'Your presence comforts people. You're calm and knowledgeable, and you talk about things they understand, swelling and confusion and pain - you don't try to impress them with jargon about humors, which just makes them feel more ignorant and powerless and frightened. When you're there, they feel that everything possible is being done; and that's what they want.'

'I hope you're right.'

If anything, Merthin was understating. More than once he had seen a hysterical man or woman change, after just a few calming moments with Caris, into a sensible person capable of coping with whatever should happen.

Her inborn gift had been augmented, since the advent of the plague, by an almost supernatural reputation. Everyone for miles around knew that she and her nuns had carried on caring for the sick, despite the risk to themselves, even when the monks had fled. They thought she was a saint.

The atmosphere inside the castle compound was subdued. Those who had routine tasks were performing them: fetching firewood and water, feeding horses and sharpening weapons, baking bread and butchering meat. Many others - secretaries, men-at-arms, messengers - sat around doing nothing, waiting for news from the sick room.

The rooks cawed a sarcastic welcome as Merthin and Caris crossed the inner bridge to the keep. Merthin's father, Sir Gerald, always claimed to be directly descended from Jack and Aliena's son, Earl Thomas. As Merthin counted the steps to the great hall, placing his feet carefully in the smooth hollows worn by thousands of boots, he reflected that his ancestors had probably trodden on just these old stones. To him, such notions were intriguing but trivial. By contrast his brother, Ralph, was obsessed with restoring the family to its former glory.

Caris was ahead of him, and the sway of her hips as she climbed the steps made his lips twitch in a smile. He was frustrated by not being able to sleep with her every night, but the rare occasions when they could be alone together were all the more thrilling. Yesterday they had spent a mild spring afternoon making love in a sunlit forest glade, while the horses grazed nearby, oblivious to their passion.

It was an odd relationship, but then she was an extraordinary woman: a prioress who doubted much of what the church taught; an acclaimed healer who rejected medicine as practised by physicians; and a nun who made enthusiastic love to her man whenever she could get away with it. If I wanted a normal relationship, Merthin told himself, I should have picked a normal girl.

The hall was full of people. Some were working, laying down fresh straw, building up the fire, preparing the table for dinner; and others were simply waiting. At the far end of the long room, sitting near the foot of the staircase that led up to the earl's private quarters, Merthin saw a well-dressed girl of about fifteen. She stood up and came toward them with a rather stately walk, and Merthin realized she must be Lady Philippa's daughter. Like her mother she was tall, with an hourglass figure. 'I am the Lady Odila,' she said with a touch of hauteur that was pure Philippa. Despite her composure, the skin around her young eyes was red and creased with crying. 'You must be Mother Caris. Thank you for coming to attend my father.'

Merthin said: 'I'm the alderman of Kingsbridge, Merthin Bridger. How is Earl William?'

'He is very ill, and both my brothers have been laid low.' Merthin recalled that the earl and countess had two boys of nineteen and twenty or thereabouts. 'My mother asks that the lady prioress should come to them immediately.'

Caris said: 'Of course.'

Odila went up the stairs. Caris took from her purse a strip of linen cloth and fastened it over her nose and mouth, then followed.

Merthin sat on a bench to wait. Although he was reconciled to infrequent sex, that did not stop him looking out eagerly for extra opportunities, and he surveyed the building with a keen eye, figuring out the sleeping arrangements. Unfortunately the house had a traditional layout. This large room, the great hall, would be where almost everyone ate and slept. The staircase presumably led to a solar, a bedroom for the earl and countess. Modern castles had a whole suite of apartments for family and guests, but there appeared to be no such luxury here. Merthin and Caris might lie side by side tonight, on the floor here in the hall, but they could do nothing more than sleep, not without causing a scandal.

After a while, Lady Philippa emerged from the solar and came down the stairs. She entered a room like a queen, aware that all eyes were on her, Merthin always thought. The dignity of her posture only emphasized the alluring roundness of her hips and her proud bosom. However, today her normally serene face was blotchy and her eyes were red. Her fashionably piled hairstyle was slightly awry, with stray locks of hair escaping from her headdress, adding to her air of glamorous distraction.

Merthin stood up and look at her expectantly.

She said: 'My husband has the plague, as I feared; and so do both my sons.'

The people around murmured in dismay.

It might turn out to be no more than the last remnants of the epidemic, of course; but it could just as easily be the start of a new outbreak - God forbid, Merthin thought.

He said: 'How is the earl feeling?'

Philippa sat on the bench next to him. 'Mother Caris has eased his pain. But she says he's near the end.'

Their knees were almost touching. He felt the magnetism of her sexuality, even though she was drowning in grief and he was dizzy with love for Caris. 'And your sons?' he said.

She looked down at her lap, as if studying the pattern of gold and silver threads woven into her blue gown. 'The same as their father.'

Merthin said quietly: 'This is very hard for you, my lady, very hard.'

She gave him a wary glance. 'You're not like your brother, are you?'

Merthin knew that Ralph had been in love with Philippa, in his own obsessive way, for many years. Did she realize that? Merthin did not know. Ralph had chosen well, he thought. If you were going to have a hopeless love, you might as well pick someone singular. 'Ralph and I are very different,' he said neutrally.

'I remember you as youngsters. You were the cheeky one - you told me to buy a green silk to match my eyes. Then your brother started a fight.'

'I sometimes think the younger of two brothers deliberately tries to be the opposite of the elder, just to differentiate himself.'

'It's certainly true of my two. Rollo is strong-willed and assertive, like his father and grandfather; and Rick has always been sweet-natured and obliging.' She began to cry. 'Oh, God, I'm going to lose them all.'

Merthin took her hand. 'You can't be sure what will happen,' he said gently. 'I caught the plague in Florence, and I survived. My daughter didn't catch it at all.'

She looked up at him. 'And your wife?'

Merthin looked down at their entwined hands. Philippa's was perceptibly more wrinkled than his, he saw, even though there was only four years' difference in their ages. He said: 'Silvia died.'

'I pray to God that I will catch it. If all my men die, I want to go, too.'

'Surely not.'

'It's the fate of noblewomen to marry men they don't love - but I was lucky, you see, in William. He was chosen for me, but I loved him from the start.' Her voice began to fail her. 'I couldn't bear to have someone else...'

'You feel that way now, of course.' It was odd to be talking like this while her husband was still alive, Merthin thought. But she was so stricken by grief that she had little thought for niceties and said just what was in her mind.

She collected herself with an effort. 'What about you?' she said. 'Have you remarried?'

'No.' He could hardly explain that he was having a love affair with the prioress of Kingsbridge. 'I think I could, though, if the right woman were...willing. You might come to feel the same, eventually.'

'But you don't understand. As the widow of an earl with no heirs, I would have to marry someone King Edward chose for me. And the king would have no thought for my wishes. His only concern would be who should be the next earl of Shiring.'

'I see.' Merthin had not thought of that. He could imagine that an arranged marriage might be particularly loathsome to a widow who had truly loved her first husband.

'How dreadful of me to be speaking of another husband while my first is alive,' she said. 'I don't know what came over me.'

Merthin patted her hand sympathetically. 'It's understandable.'

The door at the top of the stairs opened and Caris came out, drying her hands on a cloth. Merthin suddenly felt uncomfortable about holding Philippa's hand. He was tempted to thrust it away from him, but realized how guilty that would look and managed to resist the impulse. He smiled at Caris and said: 'How are your patients?'

Caris's eyes went to their linked hands, but she said nothing. She came down the stairs, untying her linen mask.

Philippa unhurriedly withdrew her hand.

Caris took off her mask and said: 'I'm very sorry to have to tell you, my lady, that Earl William is dead.'





'I need a new horse,' said Ralph Fitzgerald. His favorite mount, Griff, was getting old. The spirited bay palfrey had suffered a sprain in its left hind leg that had taken months to heal, and now it was lame again in the same leg. Ralph felt sad. Griff was the horse Earl Roland had given him when he was a young squire, and it had been with him ever since, even going to the French wars. It might serve him a few years longer for unhurried trips from village to village within his domain, but its hunting days were over.

'We could go to Shiring market tomorrow and buy another,' Alan Fernhill said.

They were in the stable, looking at Griff's fetlock. Ralph liked stables. He enjoyed the earthy smell, the strength and beauty of the horses, and the company of rough-handed men engrossed in physical tasks. It took him back to his youth, when the world had seemed a simple place.

He did not at first respond to Alan's suggestion. What Alan did not know was that Ralph did not have the money to buy a horse.

The plague had at first enriched him, through the inheritance tax: land that normally passed from father to son once in a generation had changed hands twice or more in a few months, and he got a payment every time - traditionally the best beast, but often a fixed sum in cash. But then land had started to fall into disuse for lack of people to farm it. At the same time, agricultural prices had dropped. The upshot was that Ralph's income, in money and produce, fell drastically.

Things were bad, he thought, when a knight could not afford a horse.

Then he remembered that Nate Reeve was due to come to Tench Hall today with the quarterly dues from Wigleigh. Every spring that village was obliged to provide its lord with twenty-four hoggets, year-old sheep. They could be driven to Shiring market and sold, and they should raise enough cash to pay for a palfrey, if not a hunter. 'All right,' Ralph said to Alan. 'Let's see if the bailiff of Wigleigh is here.'

They went into the hall. This was a feminine zone, and Ralph's spirits dropped immediately. Tilly was sitting by the fire, nursing their three-month-old son, Gerry. Mother and baby were in vigorous good health, despite Tilly's youth. Her slight, girlish body had changed drastically: she now had swollen breasts with large, leathery nipples at which the baby sucked greedily. Her belly sagged loosely like that of an old woman. Ralph had not lain with her for many months and he probably never would again.

Nearby sat the grandfather after whom the baby was named, Sir Gerald, with Lady Maud. Ralph's parents were now old and frail, but every morning they walked from their house in the village to the manor house to see their grandson. Maud said the baby looked like Ralph, but he could not see the resemblance.

Ralph was pleased to see that Nate was also in the hall.

The hunchbacked bailiff sprang up from his bench. 'Good day to you, Sir Ralph,' he said.

He had a hangdog look about him, Ralph observed. 'What's the matter with you, Nate?' he said. 'Have you brought my hoggets?'

'No, sir.'

'Why the devil not?'

'We've got none, sir. There are no sheep left in Wigleigh, except for a few old ewes.'

Ralph was shocked. 'Has someone stolen them?'

'No, but some have been given to you already, as heriot when their owners died, and then we couldn't find a tenant to take over Jack Shepherd's land, and many sheep died over the winter. Then there was no one to look to the early lambs this spring, so we lost most of those, and some of the mothers.'

'But this is impossible!' Ralph said angrily. 'How are noblemen to live if their serfs let the livestock perish?'

'We thought perhaps the plague was over, when it died down in January and February, but now it seems to be coming back.'

Ralph repressed a shudder of terror. Like everyone else, he had been thanking God that he had escaped the plague. Surely it could not return?

Nate went on: 'Perkin died this week, and his wife Peg, and his son Rob, and his son-in-law Billy Howard. That's left Annet with all those acres to manage, which she can't possibly do.'

'Well, there must be a heriot due on that property, then.'

'There will be, when I can find a tenant to take it over.'

Parliament was in the process of passing new legislation to stop laborers flitting about the country demanding even higher wages. As soon as the ordinance became law, Ralph would enforce it and get his workers back. Even then, he now realized, he would be desperate to find tenants.

Nate said: 'I expect you've heard of the death of the earl.'

'No!' Ralph was shocked again.

'What's that?' Sir Gerald said. 'Earl William is dead?'

'Of the plague,' Nate explained.

Tilly said: 'Poor Uncle William!'

The baby sensed her mood and wailed.

Ralph spoke over the noise. 'When did this happen?'

'Only three days ago,' Nate replied.

Tilly gave the baby the nipple again, and he shut up.

'So William's elder son is the new earl,' Ralph mused. 'He can't be more than twenty.'

Nate shook his head. 'Rollo also died of the plague.'

'Then the younger son - '

'Dead, too.'

'Both sons!' Ralph's heart leaped. It had always been his dream to become the earl of Shiring. Now the plague had given him the opportunity. And the plague had also improved his chances, for many likely candidates for the title had been wiped out.

He caught his father's eye. The same thought had occurred to Sir Gerald.

Tilly said: 'Rollo and Rick dead - it's so awful.' She began to cry.

Ralph ignored her and tried to think through the possibilities. 'Let's see, what surviving relatives are there?'

Gerald said to Nate: 'I presume the countess died, too?'

'No, sir. Lady Philippa lives. So does her daughter, Odila.'

'Ah!' said Gerald. 'So, whoever the king chooses will have to marry Philippa in order to become earl.'

Ralph was thunderstruck. Since he was a lad he had dreamed of marrying Lady Philippa. Now there was an opportunity to achieve both his ambitions at one stroke.

But he was already married.

Gerald said: 'That's it, then.' He sat back in his chair, his excitement gone as quickly as it had come.

Ralph looked at Tilly, suckling their child and weeping at the same time. Fifteen years old and barely five feet tall, she stood like a castle wall between him and the future he had always yearned for.

He hated her.





Earl William's funeral took place at Kingsbridge Cathedral. There were no monks except Brother Thomas, but Bishop Henri conducted the service and the nuns sang the hymns. Lady Philippa and Lady Odila, both heavily veiled, followed the coffin. Despite their dramatic black-clad presence, Ralph found the occasion lacked the momentous feeling that usually attended the funeral of a magnate, the sense of historical time passing by like the flow of a great river. Death was everywhere, every day, and even noble deaths were now commonplace.

He wondered whether someone in the congregation was infected, and was even now spreading the disease through his breath, or the invisible beams from his eyes. The thought made Ralph shaky. He had faced death many times, and learned to control his fear in battle; but this enemy could not be fought. The plague was an assassin who slid his long knife into people from behind then slipped away before he was spotted. Ralph shuddered and tried not to think about it.

Next to Ralph was the tall figure of Sir Gregory Longfellow, a lawyer who had been involved in suits concerning Kingsbridge in the past. Gregory was now a member of the king's council, an elite group of technical experts who advised the monarch - not on what he should do, for that was the job of Parliament, but on how he could do it.

Royal announcements were often made at church services, especially big ceremonies such as this. Today Bishop Henri took the opportunity to explain the new Ordinance of Laborers. Ralph guessed that Sir Gregory had brought the news and stayed to see how it was received.

Ralph listened attentively. He had never been summoned to Parliament, but he had talked about the labor crisis to Earl William, who had sat with the Lords, and to Sir Peter Jeffries, who represented Shiring in the Commons; so he knew what had been discussed.

'Every man must work for the lord of the village where he lives, and may not move to another village or work for another master, unless his lord should release him,' the bishop said.

Ralph rejoiced. He had known this was coming, but he was delighted that at last it was official.

Before the plague there had never been a shortage of laborers. On the contrary, many villages had more than they knew what to do with. When landless men could find no paid work, they sometimes threw themselves on the charity of the lord - which was an embarrassment to him, whether he helped them or not. So, if they wanted to move to another village, the lord was if anything relieved, and certainly had no need of legislation to keep them where they were. Now the laborers had the whip hand - a situation that obviously could not be allowed to continue.

There was a rumble of approval from the congregation at the bishop's announcement. Kingsbridge folk themselves were not much affected, but those in the congregation who had come in from the countryside for the funeral were predominantly employers rather than employees. The new rules had been devised by and for them.

The bishop went on: 'It is now a crime to demand, to offer, or to accept wages higher than those paid for similar work in 1347.'

Ralph nodded approval. Even laborers who stayed in the same village had been demanding more money. This would put a stop to that, he hoped.

Sir Gregory caught his eye. 'I see you nodding,' he said. 'Do you approve?'

'It's what we wanted,' Ralph said. 'I'll begin to enforce it in the next few days. There are a couple of runaways from my territory that I particularly want to bring home.'

'I'll come with you, if I may,' the lawyer said. 'I should like to see how things work out.'
