Wulfric went back to sleep, but Gwenda lay awake. She was too excited to sleep. She had won his love - she knew it. It hardly mattered that she had had to half-pretend to be Annet. He had made love to her with such hunger, and had kissed her afterward with such tenderness and gratitude, that she felt he was hers forever.

When her heart stopped racing and her mind calmed down, she thought about his inheritance. She was not willing to give up on it, especially now. As dawn broke outside, she racked her brains for some way to save it. When Wulfric woke up, she said: 'I'm going to Kingsbridge.'

He was startled. 'Why?'

'To find out whether there's some way you can still inherit.'

'How?'

'I don't know. But Ralph hasn't given the land to anyone else yet, so there's still a chance. And you deserve it - you've worked so hard and suffered so much.'

'What will you do?'

'I'll see my brother Philemon. He understands these things better than we do. He'll know what we need to do.'

Wulfric looked at her strangely.

She said: 'What is it?'

He said: 'You really love me, don't you?'

She smiled, full of happiness, and said: 'Let's do it again, shall we?'

On the following morning she was at Kingsbridge Priory, sitting on the stone bench by the vegetable garden, waiting for Philemon. During the long walk from Wigleigh she had gone over every second of Sunday night in her mind, relishing the physical pleasures, puzzling over the words spoken. Wulfric still had not said that he loved her, but he had said: 'You really love me.' And he had seemed pleased that she loved him, albeit a bit bewildered by the strength of her passion.

She longed to win back his birthright. She yearned for it almost as much as she had yearned for him. She wanted it for both of them. Even if he were a landless laborer like her father, she would marry him, given the chance; but she wanted better for them both, and she was determined to get it.

When Philemon came out of the priory into the garden to greet her, she saw immediately that he was wearing the robes of a novice monk. 'Holger!' she said, using his real name in her shock. 'You're a novice -

He smiled proudly, and benignly overlooked the use of his old name. 'It was one of Godwyn's first acts as prior,' he said. 'He is a wonderful man. It's such an honor to serve him.' He sat beside her on the bench. It was a mild autumn day, cloudy but dry.

'And how are you getting on with your lessons?'

'Slowly. It's hard to learn to read and write when you're grown-up.' He grimaced. 'The small boys progress faster than I do. But I can copy out the Lord's Prayer in Latin.'

She envied him. She could not even write her name. 'That's wonderful!' she said. Her brother was on his way to achieving his life's dream, and becoming a monk. Perhaps the status of novice might ameliorate the feelings of worthlessness that, she felt sure, accounted for his sometimes being sly and deceitful.

'But what about you?' he said. 'Why have you come to Kingsbridge?'

'Did you know that Ralph Fitzgerald has become lord of Wigleigh?'

'Yes. He's here in town, staying at the Bell, living it up.'

'He has refused to let Wulfric inherit his father's land.' She told Philemon the story. 'I want to know whether the decision can be contested.'

Philemon shook his head. 'The short answer is no. Wulfric could appeal to the earl of Shiring, of course, asking him to overturn Ralph's decision, but the earl won't intervene unless he has a personal stake. Even if he thinks the decision unjust - which it obviously is - he won't undermine the authority of a new appointee. But what's your interest? I thought Wulfric was going to marry Annet.'

'When Ralph announced his decision, Annet jilted Wulfric and married Billy Howard.'

'And now you have a chance with Wulfric.'

'I think so.' She felt herself blush.

'How do you know?' he asked shrewdly.

'I took advantage of him,' she confessed. 'When he was distraught over the wedding, I went to his bed.'

'Don't worry. We who are born poor have to use cunning to get what we want. Scruples are for the privileged.'

She did not really like to hear him talk that way. Sometimes he seemed to think that any behavior could be excused by their difficult childhood. But she was too disappointed to worry about that. 'Is there really nothing I can do?'

'Oh, I didn't say that. It can't be contested, I said. But Ralph might be talked around.'

'Not by me, I'm sure.'

'I don't know. Why don't you go and see Godwyn's cousin Caris? You've been friends with her since you were girls. She'll help you if she can. And she's close to Ralph's brother, Merthin. Perhaps he can think of something.'

Any hope was better than none. Gwenda stood up to go. 'I'll see her right away.' She leaned forward to kiss her brother good-bye, then realized that he was forbidden such contact now. Instead, she clasped his hand, which seemed peculiar.

'I'll pray for you,' he said.

Caris's house was opposite the priory gates. When Gwenda went in, there was no one in the dining hall, but she heard voices in the parlor, where Edmund usually did business. The cook, Tutty, told her Caris was with her father. Gwenda sat down to wait, tapping her foot impatiently, but after a few minutes the door opened.

Edmund came out accompanied by a man she did not recognize. He was tall, and had flared nostrils that gave his face a supercilious look. He wore the black robe of a priest, but no cross or other sacred symbol. Edmund nodded amiably to Gwenda and said to the stranger: 'I'll walk you back to the priory.'

Caris followed the two men out of the parlor and embraced Gwenda. 'Who was that man?' Gwenda asked as soon as he had left.

'His name is Gregory Longfellow. He's the lawyer hired by Prior Godwyn.'

'Hired for what?'

'Earl Roland has stopped the priory taking stone from its quarry. He's trying to charge a penny a cartload. Godwyn is going to appeal to the king.'

'Are you involved?'

'Gregory thinks we must argue that the town will be unable to pay its taxes without a bridge. That's the best way to persuade the king, he says. So my father will go with Godwyn to testify at the royal court.'

'Will you go, too?'

'Yes. But tell me why you're here?'

'I lay with Wulfric.'

Caris smiled. 'Really? At last! How was it?'

'It was wonderful. I lay beside him all night while he slept, then when he woke up I...persuaded him.'

'Tell me more, I want all the details.'

Gwenda told Caris the story. At the end, even though she was impatient to get on to the real purpose of her visit, she said: 'But something tells me you have news of the same kind.'

Caris nodded. 'I lay with Merthin. I told him I didn't want to get married, and he went off to see that fat sow Bessie Bell, and I got upset at the thought of her sticking out her big tits at him - then he came back, and I was so pleased I just had to do it with him.'

'Did you like it?'

'I loved it. It's the best thing ever. And it gets better. We do it whenever we get the chance.'

'What if you get pregnant?'

'I'm not even thinking about that. I don't care if I die. One time - ' She lowered her voice. 'One time, we bathed in a pool in the forest, and afterwards he licked me...down there.'

'Oh, disgusting! What was it like?'

'Nice. He liked it, too.'

'You didn't do the same to him.'

'Yes.'

'But did he...?'

Caris nodded. 'In my mouth.'

'Wasn't it foul?'

Caris shrugged. 'It tastes funny...but it's so exciting to feel that happen. And he enjoyed it so much.'

Gwenda was shocked but intrigued. Perhaps she should do that to Wulfric. She knew a place where they could bathe, a stream in the forest far from any roads...

Caris said: 'But you didn't come all this way just to tell me about Wulfric.'

'No. It's about his inheritance.' Gwenda explained Ralph's decision. 'Philemon thought perhaps Merthin could persuade Ralph to change his mind.'

Caris shook her head pessimistically. 'I doubt it. They've quarreled.'

'Oh, no!'

'It was Ralph who stopped the carts leaving the quarry. Unfortunately, Merthin was there at the time. There was a fight. Ben Wheeler killed one of the earl's ruffians, and Ralph killed Ben.'

Gwenda gasped. 'But Lib Wheeler has a two-year-old!'

'And now little Bennie has no father.'

Gwenda was dismayed for herself as well as for Lib. 'So a brother's influence won't help.'

'Let's go and see Merthin anyway. He's working on Leper Island today.'

They left the house and walked down the main street to the riverside. Gwenda was discouraged. Everyone believed her chances were slender. It was so unfair.

They got Ian Boatman to row them across to the island. Caris explained that the old bridge was to be replaced by two new ones which would use the island as a stepping stone.

They found Merthin with his boy assistant, fourteen-year-old Jimmie, laying out the abutments of the new bridge. His measuring stick was an iron pole more than twice the height of a man, and he was hammering pointed stakes into the rocky ground to mark where the foundations must be dug.

Gwenda watched the way Caris and Merthin kissed. It was different. There was a cozy relish in one another's bodies that seemed new. It matched how Gwenda herself felt about Wulfric. His body was not just desirable, it was hers to enjoy. It seemed to belong to her the way her own body did.

She and Caris watched while Merthin finished what he was doing, tying a length of twine between two stakes. Then he told Jimmie to pack up the tools.

Gwenda said: 'I suppose there's not much you can do without stone.'

'There are some preparations we can make. But I've sent all the masons to the quarry. They're dressing the stones there, instead of here on-site. We're building a stockpile.'

'So, if you win your case in the royal court, you can start building right away.'

'I hope so. It depends on how long the case takes - and the weather. We can't build in deepest winter, in case the frost freezes the mortar. It's October already. We normally stop around the middle of November.' He looked up at the sky. 'We might have a bit longer this year - rain clouds keep the earth warm.'

Gwenda told him what she wanted.

'I wish I could help you,' Merthin said. 'Wulfric is a decent man, and that fight was entirely Ralph's fault. But I've quarreled with my brother. Before asking him a favor, I'd have to make friends. And I can't forgive him for killing Ben Wheeler.'

It was the third negative response in a row, Gwenda thought glumly. Perhaps this was a foolish errand.

Caris said: 'You may have to do this on your own.'

'Yes, I will,' Gwenda said decisively. It was time to stop asking for other people's help and start relying on herself - the way she had all her life. 'Ralph is here in town, isn't he?'

'Yes,' Merthin said. 'He came to tell our parents the good news about his promotion. They're the only people in the county who are celebrating.'

'But he's not staying with them.'

'He's too grand for that now. He's at the Bell.'

'What would be the best way to persuade him?'

Merthin thought for a few moments. 'Ralph feels our father's humiliation - a knight reduced to the status of a pensioner of the priory. He'll do anything that seems to enhance his social position.'

Gwenda thought about that as Ian Boatman rowed them all back to the city. How could she present her request as a way for Ralph to raise his standing? It was midday as she walked up the main street with the others. Merthin was going to Caris's house for dinner, and Caris invited Gwenda to join them, but she was impatient to see Ralph, and she went on to the Bell.

A potboy told her Ralph was upstairs in the best room. Most lodgers slept in a communal dormitory: Ralph was emphasizing his new position by taking an entire room - paid for, Gwenda thought sourly, out of the meager harvests of Wigleigh peasants.

She knocked at the door and went in.

Ralph was there with his squire, Alan Fernhill, a boy of about eighteen with big shoulders and a small head. On the table between them stood a jug of ale, a loaf, and a joint of hot beef with a wisp of steam coming from it. They were finishing their dinner and looked thoroughly contented with their lot in life, Gwenda thought. She hoped they were not too drunk: men in that state could not talk to women; all they could do was make ribald remarks and laugh helplessly at each other's wit.

Ralph peered at her: the room was not well lit. 'You're one of my serfs, aren't you?'

'No, my lord, but I'd like to be. I'm Gwenda, and my father is Joby, a landless laborer.'

'And what are you doing so far from the village? It's not market day.'

She moved a step farther into the room so that she could see his face more clearly. 'Sir, I come to plead for Wulfric, son of the late Samuel. I know that he behaved disrespectfully to you once but, since then, he has suffered the torments of Job. His parents and brother were killed when the bridge collapsed, all the family's money was lost, and now his fiancÃ©e has married someone else. I hope you might feel that God has punished him harshly for the wrong he did you, and it is time for you to show mercy.' Remembering what Merthin had advised, she added: 'The mercy characteristic of the true nobleman.'

He belched fruitily and sighed. 'What do you care whether Wulfric inherits?'

'I love him, my lord. Now that he has been rejected by Annet, I hope he may marry me - with your gracious permission, of course.'

'Come closer,' he said.

She moved into the center of the room and stood in front of him.

His eyes roamed all over her body. 'You're not a pretty girl,' he said. 'But there's something about you. Are you a virgin?'

'Lord - I...I...'

'Obviously not,' he laughed. 'Have you lain with Wulfric yet?'

'No!'

'Liar.' He grinned, enjoying himself. 'Well, now, what if I let Wulfric have his father's lands after all? Perhaps I should. What then?'

'You would be called a true nobleman by Wigleigh and all the world.'

'The world won't care. But will you be grateful to me?'

Gwenda had a horrible feeling that she knew where this was leading. 'Of course, deeply grateful.'

'And how would you show it?'

She backed toward the door. 'Any way I could without shame.'

'Would you take off your dress?'

Her heart sank. 'No, lord.'

'Ah. Not so grateful, then.'

She reached the door and touched the handle, but she did not go out. 'What...what are you asking me, lord?'

'I want to see you naked. Then I'll decide.'

'Here?'

'Yes.'

She looked at Alan. 'In front of him?'

'Yes.'

It did not seem much, to show herself to these two men - not by comparison with the prize, winning Wulfric's inheritance back.

Swiftly, she undid her belt and pulled her dress over her head. She held the dress in her hand, keeping the other hand on the doorknob, and stared defiantly at Ralph. He looked greedily at her body, then glanced over at his companion with a grin of triumph; and Gwenda saw that this was about showing his power as much as anything else.

Ralph said: 'An ugly cow, but nice udders - eh, Alan?'

Alan replied: 'I wouldn't climb over her to get at you.'

Ralph laughed.

Gwenda said: 'Now will you grant my petition?'

Ralph put his hand to his crotch and began to stroke himself. 'Lie with me,' he said. 'On that bed.'

'No.'

'Come on - you've already done it with Wulfric, you're no virgin.'

'No.'

'Think of the lands - ninety acres, all that his father had.'

She thought. If she agreed, Wulfric would have his heart's desire - and the two of them could look forward to a life of plenty. If she continued to refuse, Wulfric would be a landless laborer, like Joby, struggling all his life to make enough to feed his children, and often failing.

Still the thought revolted her. Ralph was an unpleasant man, petty and vengeful, a bully - so different from his brother. His being tall and handsome made little difference. It would be disgusting to lie with someone she disliked so much.

The fact that she had done it with Wulfric only yesterday made the prospect of sex with Ralph even more repellent. After her night of happy intimacy with Wulfric, it would be a terrible betrayal to do the same with another man.

Don't be a fool, she told herself. For the sake of five minutes of unpleasantness, will you condemn yourself to a life of hardship? She thought of her mother, and the babies that had died. She remembered the stealing she and Philemon had been forced to do. Was it not better to prostitute herself to Ralph one time, for just a few moments, than to condemn her unborn children to a life of poverty?

Ralph remained quiet while she vacillated. He was wise: any words from him would only have strengthened her revulsion. Silence served him better.

'Please,' Gwenda said at last. 'Don't make me do this.'

'Ah,' he said. 'That tells me you're willing.'

'It's a sin,' she said desperately. She did not often talk about sin, but she thought there was a chance it might move him. 'A sin for you to ask, and a sin for me to agree.'

'Sins can be forgiven.'

'What would your brother think of you?'

That gave him pause. For a moment he seemed to hesitate.

'Please,' she said. 'Just let Wulfric inherit.'

His face hardened again. 'I've made my decision. I'm not going to reverse it - unless you can persuade me. And just saying please won't work.' His eyes glistened with desire, and he was breathing a little faster, his mouth open, his lips moist behind his beard.

She dropped her dress to the floor and walked to the bed.

'Kneel on the mattress,' Ralph said. 'No, facing away from me.'

She did as he said.

'Better view from this side,' he said, and Alan laughed loudly. Gwenda wondered if Alan was going to stay to watch, but then Ralph said: 'Leave us alone.' A moment later the door slammed.

Ralph knelt on the bed behind Gwenda. She closed her eyes and prayed for forgiveness. She felt his thick fingers exploring her. She heard him spit, then he rubbed a wet hand on her. A moment later he entered her. She groaned with shame.

Ralph misinterpreted the sound and said: 'You like that, eh?'

She wondered how long this would take. He began to move rhythmically. To ease the discomfort she moved with him, and he laughed triumphantly, thinking he had excited her lust. Her greatest fear was that this would sour her entire experience of lovemaking. In future, when she lay with Wulfric, would she think of this moment?

And then, to her horror, a warm flush of pleasure began to spread through her loins. She felt her face redden in shame. Despite her profound repugnance, her body betrayed her, and moisture flooded inside her, easing the friction of his thrusts. He sensed the change and moved faster. Disgusted with herself, she ceased to match his rhythm; but he grabbed her hips, pushing and pulling alternately, and she was helpless to resist. She remembered with dismay that her body had undermined her in the same way with Alwyn in the forest. Then as now, she had wanted her body to be a wooden statue, numb and impassive; both times, it had responded against her will.

She had killed Alwyn with his own knife.

She could not do the same to Ralph, even if she had wanted to, because he was behind her. She could not see him, and she had little control over her body. She was in his hands. She was glad when she sensed that he was approaching the climax. Soon it would be over. She felt an answering pressure in her own loins. She tried to make her body limp and her mind blank: it would be too humiliating if she, too, reached a climax. She felt Ralph ejaculate inside her, and she shuddered, not with pleasure but with loathing.

He sighed with satisfaction, withdrew from her, and lay flat on the bed.

She got up and quickly pulled on her dress.

'That was better than I expected,' Ralph said, as if he were paying her some kind of polite compliment.

She went out and slammed the door behind her.





On the following Sunday, before church, Nathan Reeve came to Wulfric's house.

Gwenda and Wulfric were sitting in the kitchen. They had had breakfast and swept the room, and now Wulfric was sewing a pair of leather trousers while Gwenda wove a belt from cords. They sat close to the window, for better light - it was raining again.

Gwenda was pretending to live in the barn, so that Father Gaspard would not be offended, but she spent every night with Wulfric. He had not mentioned marriage, which disappointed her. However, they were living more or less as man and wife, in the way that people often did when they intended to marry as soon as they got around to the formalities. The nobility and the gentry were permitted no such laxity, but it was routinely overlooked among the peasantry.

As she had feared, she felt strange making love to him. The more she tried to put Ralph out of her mind, the more he intruded. Fortunately, Wulfric never noticed her mood. He made love to her with such enthusiasm and joy that it almost swamped her guilty conscience - but not quite.

And she had the consolation of knowing that he would inherit his family's lands after all. That made up for everything. She could not tell him this, of course, for then she would have needed to explain what had changed Ralph's mind. She had told him about her conversations with Philemon, Caris, and Merthin, and had given him a partial version of her encounter with Ralph, saying only that he had promised to reconsider. So Wulfric was hopeful, rather than triumphant.

'Come to the manor house, right away, both of you,' Nathan said, putting his wet head around the door.

Gwenda said: 'What does the Lord Ralph want?'

'Will you refuse to go if the proposed topic of discussion fails to interest you?' Nathan said sarcastically. 'Don't ask stupid questions, just come.'

She put a blanket over her head to walk to the big house. She still did not have a cloak. Wulfric had money, from the sale of his crops, and could have bought her a cloak, but he was saving for the heriot.

They hurried through the rain to the manor house. It was a small version of a nobleman's castle, having a great hall with a long dining table, plus a small upper story, called the solar, for the lord's private chamber. Now it bore the signs of a house occupied by men without wives: the walls were bare of tapestries, the straw on the floor gave up a pungent smell, the dogs snarled at the newcomers, and a mouse nibbled a crust on the sideboard.

Ralph sat at the head of the table. On his right was Alan, who gave Gwenda a smirk she did her best to ignore. A minute later, Nathan came in. Behind him followed fat, sly Perkin, rubbing his hands and bowing obsequiously, his hair so oily it looked like a leather skullcap. With Perkin was his new son-in-law, Billy Howard. Billy shot a triumphant glance at Wulfric: I've got your girl, he was thinking, and now I'm going to get your land. He had a shock coming.

Nathan sat on Ralph's left. The rest of them remained standing.

Gwenda had been looking forward to this moment. It was the reward for her sacrifice. She eagerly anticipated the expression on Wulfric's face when he learned that he had inherited after all. He would be overjoyed - and she would, too. Their future would be secure, or at least as secure as was possible in a world of unpredictable weather and oscillating grain prices.

Ralph said: 'Three weeks ago, I said that Wulfric, son of Samuel, could not inherit his father's land because he's too young.' He spoke slowly and ponderously. He loves this, Gwenda thought: sitting at the head of the table, pronouncing judgment, everyone hanging on his words. 'Wulfric has been working the land since then, while I have considered who should succeed old Samuel.' He paused, then said: 'But I've come to doubt my rejection of Wulfric.'

Perkin started. He had been confident of success, and this shocked him.

Billy Howard said: 'What's this? I thought Nate - ' Then Perkin nudged him, and he shut up.

Gwenda could not restrain a smile of triumph.

Ralph said: 'Despite his youth, Wulfric has shown himself capable.'

Perkin glared at Nathan. Gwenda guessed that Nathan had promised the land to Perkin. Perhaps the bribe had already been paid.

Nathan was just as shocked as Perkin. He stared openmouthed at Ralph for a moment, turned to Perkin with a baffled expression, then looked suspiciously at Gwenda.

Ralph added: 'In this he has been well supported by Gwenda, whose strength and loyalty have impressed me.'

Nathan stared at her speculatively. She could tell what he was thinking. He realized she had intervened, and he was wondering how she had managed to change Ralph's mind. He might even be guessing the truth. She did not care if he did, so long as Wulfric remained ignorant.

Suddenly Nathan seemed to make a decision. He stood up and leaned his twisted torso across the table. He spoke to Ralph quietly. Gwenda could not hear what he said.

'Really?' Ralph said in a normal voice. 'How much?'

Nathan turned to Perkin and murmured something to him.

Gwenda said: 'Wait a minute! What's all this whispering?'

Perkin looked angry, but said reluctantly: 'Yes, all right.'

'All right to what?' Gwenda said fearfully.

'Double?' said Nathan.

Perkin nodded.

Gwenda had a feeling of dread.

Nathan said aloud: 'Perkin offers to pay double the normal heriot, which would be five pounds.'

Ralph said: 'That makes a difference.'

Gwenda cried: 'No!'

Wulfric spoke for the first time. 'The heriot is laid down by custom, recorded in the manor rolls,' he said in his slow, boy-man voice. 'It's not for negotiation.'

Nathan said quickly: 'Heriots can change, though. They're not in the Domesday Book.'

Ralph said: 'Are you two lawyers? If not, shut up. The heriot is two pounds and ten shillings. Any other money that changes hands is none of your business.'

Gwenda realized with horror that Ralph was on the point of reneging on their deal. She spoke in a low, accusing voice, slow but clear. 'You made me a promise.'

'Why would I do something like that?' Ralph said.

It was the one question she could not answer. 'Because I pleaded with you,' she replied feebly.

'And I said I would think again. But I made no promise.'

She was powerless to make him keep his word. She wanted to kill him. 'Yes, you did!' she said.

'Lords don't bargain with peasants.'

She stared at him, lost for words. It had all been for nothing: the long walk to Kingsbridge, the humiliation of appearing naked in front of him and Alan, the shameful act she had performed on Ralph's bed. She had betrayed Wulfric, and he still would not inherit. She pointed a finger at Ralph and said bitterly: 'God damn you to hell, Ralph Fitzgerald.'

He went pale. The curse of a genuinely wronged woman was known to be powerful. 'Watch what you say,' he replied. 'We have a punishment for a witch who casts spells.'

Gwenda drew back. No woman could take such a threat lightly. The accusation of witchcraft was easy to make and hard to refute. Still she could not resist saying: 'Those who escape justice in this life will find it in the next.'

Ralph ignored that and turned to Perkin. 'Where is the money?'

Perkin had not got rich by telling people where he kept his cash. 'I'll fetch it right away, lord,' he said.

Wulfric said: 'Come on, Gwenda. There's no mercy for us here.'

Gwenda fought back tears. Anger had been replaced by grief. They had lost the battle, after all they had done. She turned away, head lowered to hide her emotions.

Perkin said: 'Wait, Wulfric. You need employment - and I need help. Work for me. I'll pay you a penny a day.'

Wulfric flushed with the shame of being offered a job as a laborer on lands his family had owned.

Perkin added: 'Gwenda, too. You're both young and willing.'

He did not intend to be malicious, Gwenda saw. He was single-minded in the pursuit of his own interests, and he was eager to hire two strong young laborers to help him farm his amalgamated holding. He did not care, or perhaps did not even know, that for Wulfric this was the final humiliation.

Perkin said: 'That's a shilling a week between you. You'll have plenty.'

Wulfric looked bitter. 'Work for a wage, on lands that my family has owned for decades?' he said. 'Never.' He turned away and left the house.

Gwenda followed, thinking: What are we going to do now?
