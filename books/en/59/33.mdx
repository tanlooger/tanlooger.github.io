'I've got the solution,' Caris said to her father.

He sat back in the big wooden seat at the head of the table, a slight smile on his face. She knew that look. It was skeptical, but willing to listen. 'Go on,' he said.

She was a little nervous. She felt sure her idea would work - saving her father's fortune and Merthin's bridge - but could she convince Edmund? 'We take our surplus wool and have it woven into cloth and dyed,' she said simply. She held her breath, waiting for his reaction.

'Wool merchants often try that in hard times,' he said. 'But tell me why you think it would work. What would it cost?'

'For cleaning, spinning, and weaving, four shillings per sack.'

'And how much cloth would that make?'

'A sack of poor-quality wool, that you bought for thirty-six shillings, and wove for four more shillings, would make forty-eight yards of cloth.'

'Which you would sell for...?'

'Undyed, brown burel sells for a shilling a yard, so forty-eight shillings - eight more than we would have paid out.'

'It's not much, considering the work we would have put in.'

'But that's not the best of it.'

'Keep going.'

'Weavers sell their brown burel because they're in a hurry to get the money. But if you spend another twenty shillings fulling the cloth, to thicken it, then dyeing and finishing it, you can get double the price - two shillings a yard, ninety-six shillings for the whole lot - thirty-six shillings more than you paid!'

Edmund looked dubious. 'If it's so easy, why don't more people do it?'

'Because they don't have the money to lay out.'

'Nor do I!'

'You've got three pounds from Guillaume of London.'

'Am I to have nothing with which to buy wool next year?'

'At these prices, you're better off out of the business.'

He laughed. 'By the saints, you're right. Very well, try it out with some cheap stuff. I've got five sacks of coarse Devon wool that the Italians never want. I'll give you a sack of that, and see if you can do what you say.'





Two weeks later, Caris found Mark Webber smashing up his hand mill.

She was shocked to see a poor man destroying a valuable piece of equipment - so much so that, for a moment, she forgot her own troubles.

The hand mill consisted of two stone disks, each slightly roughened on one face. The smaller sat on the larger, fitting perfectly into a shallow indentation, rough side to rough. A protruding wooden handle enabled the upper stone to be turned while the lower remained still. Ears of grain placed between the two stones would be rapidly ground to flour.

Most Kingsbridge people of the lower class had a hand mill. The very poor could not afford one, and the affluent did not need one - they could buy flour already ground by a miller. But for families such as the Webbers, who needed every penny they earned to feed their children, a hand mill was a money-saving godsend.

Mark had laid his on the ground in front of his small house. He had borrowed from somewhere a long-handled sledgehammer with an iron head. Two of his children were watching, a thin girl in a ragged dress and a naked toddler. He lifted the hammer over his head and swung it in a long arc. It was a sight to see: he was the biggest man in Kingsbridge, with shoulders like a carthorse. The stone crazed like an eggshell and fell into pieces.

Caris said: 'What on earth are you doing?'

'We must grind corn at the prior's watermills, and forfeit one sack in twenty-four as a fee,' Mark replied.

He seemed phlegmatic about it, but she was horrified. 'I thought the new rules applied only to unlicensed windmills and watermills.'

'Tomorrow I have to go around with John Constable, searching people's homes, breaking up illicit hand mills. I can't have them saying I've got one of my own. That's why I'm doing this in the street, where everyone can see.'

'I didn't realize Godwyn intended to take the bread out of the mouths of the poor,' Caris said grimly.

'Luckily for us, we've got some weaving to do - thanks to you.'

Caris turned her mind to her own business. 'How are you getting on?'

'Finished.'

'That was quick!'

'It takes longer in winter. But in summer, with sixteen hours of daylight, I can weave six yards in a day, with Madge helping.'

'Wonderful!'

'Come inside and I'll show you.'

His wife, Madge, was standing over the cooking fire at the back of the one-room house, with a baby on one arm and a shy boy at her side. Madge was shorter than her husband by more than a foot, but her build was chunky. She had a large bust and a jutting behind, and she made Caris think of a plump pigeon. Her protruding jaw gave her an aggressive air that was not entirely misleading. Although combative, she was good-hearted, and Caris liked her. She offered her visitor a cup of cider, which Caris refused, knowing the family could not afford it.

Mark's loom was a wooden frame, more than a yard square, on a stand. It took up most of the living space. Behind it, close to the back door, was a table with two benches. Obviously they all slept on the floor around the loom.

'I make narrow dozens,' Mark explained. 'A narrow dozen is a cloth a yard wide and twelve yards long. I can't make broadcloth, because I haven't room for such a wide loom.' Four rolls of brown burel were stacked against the wall. 'One sack of wool makes four narrow dozens,' he said.

Caris had brought him the raw fleeces in a standard woolsack. Madge had arranged for the wool to be cleaned, sorted, and spun into yarn. The spinning was done by the poor women of the town, and the cleaning and sorting by their children.

Caris felt the cloth. She was excited: she had completed the first stage of her plan. 'Why is it so loosely woven?' she asked.

Mark bristled. 'Loose? My burel is the tightest weave in Kingsbridge!'

'I know - I didn't mean to sound critical. But Italian cloth feels so different - yet they make it from our wool.'

'Partly it depends on the weaver's strength, and how hard he can press down the batten to pack the wool.'

'I don't think the Italian weavers are all stronger than you.'

'Then it's their machines. The better the loom, the closer the weave.'

'I was afraid of that.' The implication was that Caris could not compete with high-quality Italian wool unless she bought Italian looms, which seemed impossible.

One problem at a time, she told herself. She paid Mark, counting out four shillings, of which he would have to give about half to the women who had done the spinning. Caris had made eight shillings profit, theoretically. Eight shillings would not pay for much work on the bridge. And at this rate it would take years to weave all her father's surplus wool. 'Is there any way we can produce cloth faster?' she said to Mark.

Madge answered. 'There are other weavers in Kingsbridge, but most of them are committed to work for existing cloth merchants. I can find you more outside the town, though. The larger villages often have a weaver with a loom. He usually makes cloth for the villagers from their own yarn. Such men can easily switch to another job, if the money's good.'

Caris concealed her anxiety. 'All right,' she said. 'I'll let you know. Meanwhile, will you deliver these cloths to Peter Dyer for me?'

'Of course. I'll take them now.'

Caris went home for dinner, deep in thought. To make any real difference, she would have to spend most of what money her father had left. If things went wrong, they would be even worse off. But what was the alternative? Her plan was risky, but no one else had any kind of plan at all.

When she arrived home, Petranilla was serving a mutton stew. Edmund sat at the head of the table. The financial setback of the Fleece Fair seemed to have affected him more severely than Caris would have expected. His normal exuberance was subdued, and he often appeared thoughtful, not to say distracted. Caris was worried about him.

'I saw Mark Webber smashing up his hand mill,' she said as she sat down. 'Where's the sense in that?'

Petranilla put her nose in the air. 'Godwyn is entirely within his rights,' she said.

'Those rights are out of date - they haven't been enforced for years. Where else does a priory do such things?'

'In St. Albans,' Petranilla said triumphantly.

Edmund said: 'I've heard of St. Albans. The townspeople periodically riot against the monastery.'

'Kingsbridge Priory is entitled to recoup the money it spent building mills,' Petranilla argued. 'Just as you, Edmund, want to get back the money you're putting into the bridge. How would you feel if someone built a second bridge?'

Edmund did not answer her, so Caris did. 'It would depend entirely on how soon it happened,' she said. 'The priory's mills were built hundreds of years ago, as were the warrens and fishponds. No one has the right to hold back the development of the town forever.'

'The prior has a right to collect his dues,' she said stubbornly.

'Well, if he carries on like this, there will be no one to collect dues from. People will go and live in Shiring. They're allowed hand mills there.'

'Don't you understand that the needs of the priory are sacred?' Petranilla said angrily. 'The monks serve God! By comparison with that, the lives of the townspeople are insignificant.'

'Is that what your son Godwyn believes?'

'Of course.'

'I was afraid of that.'

'Don't you believe the prior's work is sacred?'

Caris had no answer to that, so she just shrugged, and Petranilla looked triumphant.

The dinner was good, but Caris was too tense to eat much. As soon as the others had finished, she said: 'I have to go and see Peter Dyer.'

Petranilla protested: 'Are you going to spend more? You've already given Mark Webber four shillings of your father's money.'

'Yes - and the cloth is worth twelve shillings more than the wool was, so I've made eight shillings.'

'No, you haven't,' Petranilla said. 'You haven't sold the cloth yet.'

Petranilla was expressing doubts that Caris shared, in her more pessimistic moments, but she was stung into denial. 'I will sell it, though - especially if it's dyed red.'

'And what will Peter charge for dyeing and fulling four narrow dozens?'

'Twenty shillings - but the red cloth will be worth double the brown burel, so we'll make another twenty-eight shillings.'

'If you sell it. And if you don't?'

'I'll sell it.'

Her father intervened. 'Let her be,' he said to Petranilla. 'I've told her she can give this a try.'





Shiring Castle stood on top of a hill. It was the home of the county sheriff. At the foot of the hill stood the gallows. Whenever there was a hanging, the prisoner was brought down from the castle on a cart, to be hanged in front of the church.

The square in which the gallows stood was also the marketplace. The Shiring Fair was held here, between the guildhall and a large timber building called the Wool Exchange. The bishop's palace and numerous taverns also stood around the square.

This year, because of the troubles at Kingsbridge, there were more stalls than ever, and the fair spilled into the streets off the marketplace. Edmund had brought forty sacks of wool on ten carts, and could get more brought from Kingsbridge before the end of the week, if necessary.

To Caris's dismay, it was not necessary. He sold ten sacks on the first day, then nothing until the end of the fair, when he sold another ten by reducing the price below what he had paid. She could not remember seeing him so down.

She put her four lengths of dull brownish red cloth on his stall, and over the week, yard by yard, she sold three of the four. 'Look at it this way,' she said to her father on the last day of the fair. 'Before, you had a sack of unsaleable wool and four shillings. Now you've got thirty-six shillings and a length of cloth.'

But her cheerfulness was only for his benefit. She was deeply depressed. She had boasted bravely that she could sell cloth. The result was not a complete failure, but it was no triumph. If she could not sell the cloth for more than it cost, then she did not have the solution to the problem. What was she going to do? She left the stall and went to survey other cloth sellers.

The best cloth came from Italy, as always. Caris stopped at the stall of Loro Fiorentino. Cloth merchants such as Loro were not wool buyers, though they often worked closely with buyers. Caris knew that Loro gave his English takings to Buonaventura, who used it to pay English merchants for their raw wool. Then, when the wool reached Florence, Buonaventura's family would sell it, and with the proceeds pay back Loro's family. That way, they all avoided the hazards of transporting barrels of gold and silver coins across Europe.

Loro had on his stall only two rolls of cloth, but the colors were much brighter than anything the local people could produce. 'Is this all you brought?' Caris asked him.

'Of course not. I've sold the rest.'

She was surprised. 'Everyone else is having a bad fair.'

He shrugged. 'The finest cloth always sells.'

An idea was taking shape in Caris's head. 'How much is the scarlet?'

'Only seven shillings per yard, mistress.'

That was seven times the price of burel. 'But who can afford it?'

'The bishop took a lot of my red, Lady Philippa some blue and green, a few daughters of the brewers and bakers in town, some lords and ladies from the villages round about...Even when times are hard, someone is prospering. This vermilion will be so beautiful on you.' With a swift motion, he unrolled the bale and draped a length over Caris's shoulder. 'Marvelous. See how everyone is looking at you already.'

She smiled. 'I can see why you sell so much.' She handled the cloth. It was closely woven. She already had a cloak of Italian scarlet that she had inherited from her mother. It was her favorite garment. 'What dye do they use to get this red?'

'Madder, the same as everyone.'

'But how do they make it so bright?'

'It's no secret. They use alum. It brightens the color and also fixes it, so it won't fade. A cloak in this color, for you, would be wonderful, a joy forever.'

'Alum,' she repeated. 'Why don't English dyers use it?'

'It's very expensive. It comes from Turkey. Such luxury is only for special women.'

'And the blue?'

'Like your eyes.'

Her eyes were green, but she did not correct him. 'It's such a deep color.'

'English dyers use woad, but we get indigo from Bengal. Moorish traders bring it from India to Egypt, and then our Italian merchants buy it in Alexandria.' He smiled. 'Think how far it has traveled - to complement your outstanding beauty.'

'Yes,' said Caris. 'Just think of that.'





The riverside workshop of Peter Dyer was a house as big as Edmund's, but built of stone, and with no interior walls or floors - just a shell. Two iron cauldrons stood over great fires. Beside each was a hoist, like the ones Merthin made for building work. These were used to lift huge sacks of wool or cloth and lower them into the vats. The floors were permanently wet and the air was thick with steam. The apprentices worked barefoot, in their underdrawers because of the heat, their faces running with sweat, their hair gleaming with damp. There was an acrid smell that bit at the back of Caris's throat.

She showed Peter her unsold length of cloth. 'I want the bright scarlet that the Italian cloths have,' she said. 'That's what sells best.'

Peter was a lugubrious man who always looked injured, no matter what you said to him. Now he nodded glumly, as if acknowledging a justified criticism. 'We'll dye it again with madder.'

'And with alum, to fix the color and make it brighter.'

'We don't use alum. Never have. I don't know anyone who does.'

Caris cursed inwardly. She had not thought to check this. She had assumed a dyer would know everything about dyes. 'Can't you try it?'

'I haven't got any.'

Caris sighed. Peter seemed to be one of those craftsmen for whom everything is impossible unless they have done it before. 'Suppose I could get you some?'

'Where from?'

'Winchester, I suppose, or London. Or perhaps from Melcombe.' That was the nearest big port. Ships came from all over Europe to Melcombe.

'If I had some, I wouldn't know how to use it.'

'Can't you find out?'

'Who from?'

'I'll try to find out, then.'

He shook his head pessimistically. 'I don't know...'

She did not want to quarrel with him: he was the only large-scale dyer in town. 'We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,' she said in a conciliatory tone. 'I won't take up any more of your time discussing it now. First I'll see if I can get some alum.'

She left him. Who in town might know about alum? She wished now that she had asked Loro Fiorentino more questions. The monks ought to know about things like this, but they were no longer allowed to talk to women. She decided to see Mattie Wise. Mattie was forever mixing strange ingredients - maybe alum was one of them. More importantly, if she did not know she would admit her ignorance, unlike a monk or an apothecary who might make something up for fear of being thought foolish.

Mattie's first words were: 'How is your father?'

'He seems a bit shaken by the failure of the Fleece Fair,' Caris said. It was typical of Mattie to know what she was worried about. 'He's becoming forgetful. He seems older.'

'Take care of him,' said Mattie. 'He's a good man.'

'I know.' Caris was not sure what Mattie was getting at.

'Petranilla is a self-centered cow.'

'I know that, too.'

Mattie was grinding something with a mortar and pestle. She pushed the bowl toward Caris. 'If you do this for me, I'll pour you a cup of wine.'

'Thank you.' Caris began to grind.

Mattie poured yellow wine from a stone jug into two wooden cups. 'Why are you here? You're not ill.'

'Do you know what alum is?'

'Yes. In small quantities, we use it as an astringent, to close wounds. It can also stop diarrhea. But in large quantities it's poisonous. Like most poisons, it makes you vomit. There was alum in the potion I gave you last year.'

'What is it, a herb?'

'No, it's an earth. The Moors mine it in Turkey and Africa. Tanners employ it in the preparation of leather, sometimes. I suppose you want to use it to dye cloth.'

'Yes.' As always, Mattie's guesswork seemed supernaturally accurate.

'It acts as a mordant - it helps the dye to bite the wool.'

'And where do you get it?'

'I buy it in Melcombe,' said Mattie.





Caris made the two-day journey to Melcombe, where she had been several times before, accompanied by one of her father's employees as a bodyguard. At the quayside she found a merchant who dealt in spices, cage birds, musical instruments, and all kinds of curiosities from remote parts of the world. He sold her both the red dye made from the root of the madder plant, cultivated in France, and a type of alum known as Spiralum that he said came from Ethiopia. He charged her seven shillings for a small barrel of madder and a pound for a sack of alum, and she had no idea whether she was paying fair prices or not. He sold her his entire stock, and promised to get more from the next Italian ship to come into port. She asked him what quantities of dye and alum she should use, but he did not know.

When she got home, she began to dye pieces of her unsold cloth in a cooking pot. Petranilla objected to the smell, so Caris built a fire in the backyard. She knew that she had to put the cloth in a solution of dye and boil it, and Peter Dyer told her the correct strength of the dye solution. However, no one knew how much alum she needed or how she should use it.

She began a frustrating process of trial and error. She tried soaking the cloth in alum before dyeing it; putting the alum in at the same time as the dye; and boiling the dyed cloth in a solution of alum afterward. She tried using the same quantity of alum as dye, then more, then less. At Mattie's suggestion she experimented with other ingredients: oak galls, chalk, lime water, vinegar, urine.

She was short of time. In all towns, no one could sell cloth but members of the guild - except during a fair, when the normal rules were relaxed. And all fairs were held in summer. The last was St. Giles's Fair, which took place on the downs to the east of Winchester on St. Giles's Day, September 12. It was now mid-July, so she had eight weeks.

She started early in the morning and worked until long after dark. Agitating the cloth continuously and lifting it in and out of the pot made her back ache. Her hands became red and sore from constant dipping in the harsh chemicals, and her hair began to smell. But, despite the frustration, she occasionally felt happy, and sometimes she hummed or even sang as she worked, old tunes whose words she could barely remember from childhood. Neighbors in their own backyards watched her curiously across the fences.

Now and again there came into her mind the thought: Is this my fate? More than once she had said that she did not know what to do with her life. But she might not have a free choice. She was not to be allowed to be a physician; becoming a wool merchant looked like a bad idea; she did not want to enslave herself to a husband and children - but she had never dreamed that she might end up as a dyer. When she thought about it, she knew that this was not what she wanted to do. Having started it, she was determined to succeed - but it was not going to be her destiny.

At first she could only get the cloth to turn brownish red or pale pink. When she began to approach the right shade of scarlet she found, maddeningly, that it faded when she dried it in the sun, or it came out when washed. She tried double-dyeing, but the effect proved temporary. Peter told her, rather late, that the material would soak up dye more completely if she worked with the yarn before it was woven, or even with raw fleeces; and that improved the shade, but not the fastness.

'There's only one way to learn dyeing, and that's from a master,' Peter said several times. They all thought that way, Caris realized. Prior Godwyn learned medicine by reading books that were hundreds of years old, and prescribed medicines without even looking at his patient. Elfric had punished Merthin for carving the parable of the virgins in a new way. Peter had never even tried to dye cloth scarlet. Only Mattie based her decisions on what she could see for herself, rather than on some venerated authority.

Caris's sister Alice stood watching her late one evening, with folded arms and pursed lips. As darkness gathered in the corners of the yard, the light of Caris's fire reddened Alice's disapproving face. 'How much of our father's money have you spent on this foolishness?' she said.

Caris added it up. 'Seven shillings for the madder, a pound for the alum, twelve shillings for the cloth - thirty-nine shillings.'

'God save us!' Alice was horrified.

Caris herself was daunted. It was more than a year's wages for most people in Kingsbridge. 'It is a lot, but I'll make more,' she said.

Alice was angry. 'You have no right to spend his money like this.'

'No right?' Caris said. 'I have his permission - what more do I need?'

'He's showing signs of age. His judgment is not what it was.'

Caris pretended not to know this. 'His judgment is fine, and a lot better than yours.'

'You're spending our inheritance!'

'Is that what's bothering you? Don't worry, I'm making you money.'

'I don't want to take the risk.'

'You're not taking the risk, he is.'

'He shouldn't throw away money that should come to us!'

'Tell him that.'

Alice went away defeated, but Caris was not as confident as she pretended. She might never get it just right. And then what would she and her father do?

When finally she found the right formula, it was remarkably simple: an ounce of madder and two ounces of alum for every three ounces of wool. She boiled the wool in the alum first, then added the madder to the pot without reboiling the liquid. The extra ingredient was lime water. She could hardly believe the result. It was more successful than she could have hoped. The red was bright, almost like the Italian red. She felt sure it would fade, and give her another disappointment; but the color remained the same through drying, rewashing, and fulling.

She gave Peter the formula, and under her close supervision, he used all her remaining alum to dye twelve yards of best-quality wool cloth in one of his giant vats. When it had been fulled, Caris paid a finisher to draw off the loose threads with a teazle, the prickly head of a wildflower, and to repair small blemishes.

She went to St Giles's Fair with a bale of perfect bright red cloth.

As she was unrolling it, she was addressed by a man with a London accent. 'How much is that?' he said.

She looked at him. His clothes were expensive without being ostentatious, and she guessed he was wealthy but not noble. Trying to mask the trembling in her voice, she said: 'Seven shillings a yard. It's the best - '

'No, I meant how much for the whole cloth.'

'It's twelve yards, so that would be eighty-four shillings.'

He rubbed the cloth between finger and thumb. 'It's not as close-woven as Italian cloth, but it's not bad. I'll give you twenty-seven gold florins.'

The gold coin of Florence was in common use, because England had no gold currency of its own. It was worth about three shillings, thirty-six English silver pennies. The Londoner was offering to buy her entire cloth for only three shillings less than she would get selling it yard by yard. But she sensed that he was not very serious about haggling - otherwise he would have started lower. 'No,' she said, marveling at her own temerity. 'I want the full price.'

'All right,' he said immediately, confirming her instinct. She watched, thrilled, as he took out his purse. A moment later she held in her hand twenty-eight gold florins.

She examined one carefully. It was a bit larger than a silver penny. On one side was St. John the Baptist, the patron saint of Florence, and on the other the flower of Florence. She placed it on a balance to compare its weight with that of a new-minted florin her father kept for the purpose. The coin was good.

'Thank you,' she said, hardly believing her success.

'I'm Harry Mercer of Cheapside, London,' he said. 'My father is the largest cloth merchant in England. When you've got more of this scarlet, come to London. We'll buy as much as you can bring us.'





'Let's weave it all!' she said to her father when she returned home. 'You've got forty sacks of wool left. We'll turn it all into red cloth.'

'It's a big enterprise,' he said thoughtfully.

Caris was sure her scheme would work. 'There are plenty of weavers, and they're all poor. Peter isn't the only dyer in Kingsbridge, we can teach the others to use the alum.'

'Others will copy you, once the secret gets out.'

She knew he was right to think of snags, but all the same she felt impatient. 'Let them copy,' she said. 'They can make money, too.'

He was not going to be pushed into anything. 'The price will come down if there's a lot of cloth for sale.'

'It will have to fall a long way before the business becomes unprofitable.'

He nodded. 'That's true. But can you sell that much in Kingsbridge and Shiring? There aren't that many rich people.'

'Then I'll take it to London.'

'All right.' He smiled. 'You're so determined. It's a good plan - but even if it were a bad one, you'd probably make it work.'

She went immediately to Mark Webber's house and arranged for him to begin work on another sack of wool. She also arranged for Madge to take one of Edmund's oxcarts and four sacks of wool, and go around neighboring villages looking for weavers.

But the rest of Caris's family were not happy. Next day, Alice came to dinner. As they sat down, Petranilla said to Edmund: 'Alice and I think you should reconsider your cloth-making project.'

Caris wanted him to tell her that the decision was made and it was too late to go back. But instead he said mildly: 'Really? Tell me why.'

'You'll be risking just about every penny you've got, that's why!'

'Most of it's at risk now,' he said. 'I've got a warehouse full of wool that I can't sell.'

'But you could make a bad situation worse.'

'I've decided to take that chance.'

Alice broke in: 'It's not fair on me!'

'Why not?'

'Caris is spending my inheritance!'

His face darkened. 'I'm not dead yet,' he said.

Petranilla clamped her mouth shut, recognizing the undertone in his low voice; but Alice did not notice how angry he was, and plowed on. 'We have to think about the future,' she said. 'Why should Caris be allowed to spend my birthright?'

'Because it's not yours yet, and perhaps it never will be.'

'You can't just throw away money that should come to me.'

'I won't be told what to do with my money - especially by my children,' he said, and his voice was so taut with anger that even Alice noticed.

More quietly, she said: 'I didn't intend to annoy you.'

He grunted. It was not much of an apology, but he could never remain grumpy for long. 'Let's have dinner and say no more about it,' he said; and Caris knew that her project had survived another day.

After dinner she went to see Peter Dyer, to warn him of the large quantity of work coming his way. 'It can't be done,' he said.

That took her by surprise. He always looked gloomy, but he normally did what she wanted. 'Don't worry, you won't have to dye it all,' she said. 'I'll give some of the work to others.'

'It's not the dyeing,' he said. 'It's the fulling.'

'Why?'

'We're not allowed to full the cloth ourselves. Prior Godwyn has issued a new edict. We have to use the priory's fulling mill.'

'Well, then, we'll use it.'

'It's too slow. The machinery is old, and keeps breaking down. It's been repaired again and again, so the wood is a mixture of new and old, which never sorts well. It's no faster than a man treading in a bath of water. And there's only one mill. It will barely cope with the normal work of Kingsbridge weavers and dyers.'

This was maddening. Surely her whole scheme could not fail because of a stupid ruling by her cousin Godwyn? She said indignantly: 'But if the mill can't do the work, the prior must permit us to tread the cloth by foot!'

Peter shrugged. 'Tell him that.'

'I will!'

She marched off toward the priory, but before she got there, she thought again. The hall of the prior's house was used for his meetings with townspeople, but all the same it would be unusual for a woman to go in alone without an appointment, and Godwyn was increasingly touchy about such things. Moreover, a straight confrontation might not be the best way to change his mind. She realized she would do better to think this through. She returned to her house and sat down with her father in the parlor.

'Young Godwyn is on weak ground here,' Edmund said immediately. 'There never was a charge for using the fulling mill. According to legend, it was built by a townsman, Jack Builder, for the great Prior Philip; and, when Jack died, Philip gave the town the right to use the mill in perpetuity.'

'Why did people stop using it?'

'It fell into disrepair, and I think there was an argument about who should pay for its upkeep. The argument was never resolved, and people went back to treading cloth themselves.'

'Why, then, he has no right to charge a fee, nor to force people to use it!'

'No, indeed.'

Edmund sent a message to the priory asking when it might be convenient for Godwyn to see him, and the reply came back saying he was free right away, so Edmund and Caris crossed the street and went to the prior's house.

Godwyn had changed a lot in a year, Caris thought. There was no boyish eagerness left. He seemed wary, as if he expected them to be aggressive. She was beginning to wonder whether he had the strength of character to be prior.

Philemon was with him, pathetically eager as ever to fetch chairs and pour drinks, but with a new touch of assurance in his manner, the look of someone who knew he belonged here.

'So, Philemon, you're an uncle now,' Caris said. 'What do you think of your new nephew, Sam?'

'I'm a novice monk,' he said prissily. 'We give up all worldly relations.'

Caris shrugged. She knew he was fond of his sister Gwenda, but if he wanted to pretend otherwise, she was not going to argue.

Edmund laid out the problem starkly for Godwyn. 'Work on the bridge will have to stop if the wool merchants of Kingsbridge can't improve their fortunes. Happily, we have come up with a new source of income. Caris has discovered how to produce high-quality scarlet cloth. Only one thing stands in the way of the success of this new enterprise: the fulling mill.'

'Why?' said Godwyn. 'The scarlet cloth can be fulled at the mill.'

'Apparently not. It's old and inefficient. It can barely handle the existing production of cloth. It has no capacity for extra. Either you build a new fulling mill - '

'Out of the question,' Godwyn interrupted. 'I have no spare cash for that sort of thing.'

'Very well, then,' said Edmund. 'You'll have to permit people to full cloth in the old way, by putting it in a bath of water and stamping on it with their bare feet.'

The look that came over Godwyn's face was familiar to Caris. It was compounded of resentment, injured pride, and mulish obstinacy. In childhood he had looked like that whenever he was opposed. It meant he would try to bully the other children into submission or, failing that, stamp his foot and go home. Wanting his own way was only part of it. He seemed, Caris thought, to feel humiliated by disagreement, as if the idea that someone might think him wrong was too wounding to be borne. Whatever the explanation, she knew as soon as she saw the look that he was not going to be reasonable.

'I knew you would oppose me,' he said petulantly to Edmund. 'You seem to think the priory exists for the benefit of Kingsbridge. You'll just have to realize that it's the other way around.'

Edmund rapidly became exasperated. 'Don't you see that we depend on one another? We thought you understood that interrelationship - that's why we helped you get elected.'

'I was elected by the monks, not the merchants. The town may depend on the priory, but there was a priory here before there was a town, and we can exist without you.'

'You can exist, perhaps, but as an isolated outpost, rather than as the throbbing heart of a bustling city.'

Caris put in: 'You must want Kingsbridge to prosper, Godwyn - why else would you have gone to London to oppose Earl Roland?'

'I went to the royal court to defend the ancient rights of the priory - as I am trying to do here and now.'

Edmund said indignantly: 'This is treachery! We supported you as prior because you led us to believe you would build a bridge!'

'I owe you nothing,' Godwyn replied. 'My mother sold her house to send me to the university - where was my rich uncle then?'

Caris was amazed that Godwyn was still resentful over what had happened ten years ago.

Edmund's expression became coldly hostile. 'I don't think you have the right to force people to use the fulling mill,' he said.

A glance passed between Godwyn and Philemon, and Caris realized they knew this. Godwyn said: 'There may have been times when the prior generously allowed the townspeople to use the mill without charge.'

'It was the gift of Prior Philip to the town.'

'I know nothing of that.'

'There must be a document in your records.'

Godwyn became angry. 'The townspeople have allowed the mill to fall into disrepair, so that the priory has to pay to put it right. That is enough to annul any gift.'

Edmund was right, Caris realized: Godwyn was on weak ground. He knew about Prior Philip's gift, but he intended to ignore it.

Edmund tried again. 'Surely we can settle this between us?'

'I will not back down from my edict,' Godwyn said. 'It would make me appear weak.'

That was what really bothered him, Caris realized. He was frightened that the townspeople would disrespect him if he changed his mind. His obstinacy came, paradoxically, from a kind of timidity.

Edmund said: 'Neither of us wants the trouble and expense of another visit to the royal court.'

Godwyn bristled. 'Are you threatening me with the royal court?'

'I'm trying to avoid it. But...'

Caris closed her eyes, praying that the two men would not push their argument to the brink. Her prayer was not answered.

'But what?' said Godwyn challengingly.

Edmund sighed. 'But yes, if you force the townspeople to use the fulling mill, and prohibit home fulling, I will appeal to the king.'

'So be it,' said Godwyn.
