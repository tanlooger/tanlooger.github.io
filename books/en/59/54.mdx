Merthin left Italy in company with a dozen merchants from Florence and Lucca. They took a ship from Genoa to the ancient French port of Marseilles. From there they traveled overland to Avignon, home of the pope for the last forty years or more, and the most lavish court in Europe - as well as the smelliest city Merthin had ever known. There they joined a large group of clergymen and returning pilgrims heading north.

Everyone traveled in groups, the larger the better. The merchants were carrying money and expensive trading goods, and they had men-at-arms to protect them from outlaws. They were happy to have company: priestly robes and pilgrim badges might deter robbers, and even ordinary travelers such as Merthin helped just by swelling the numbers.

Merthin had entrusted most of his fortune to the Caroli family in Florence. Their relatives in England would give him cash. The Carolis carried on this kind of international transaction all the time, and indeed Merthin had used their services nine years ago to transfer a smaller fortune from Kingsbridge to Florence. All the same, he knew that the system was not completely infallible - such families sometimes went bankrupt, especially if they got involved in lending money to untrustworthy types such as kings and princes. That was why he had a large sum in gold florins sewn into his undershirt.

Lolla enjoyed the journey. As the only child in the caravan, she was much fussed over. During the long days on horseback, she sat on the saddle in front of Merthin, his arms holding her safe while his hands held the reins. He sang songs, repeated rhymes, told stories, and talked to her about the things they saw - trees, mills, bridges, churches. She probably did not understand half of what he said, but the sound of his voice kept her happy.

He had never before spent this much time with his daughter. They were together all day, every day, week after week. He hoped the intimacy would make up, in part, for the loss of her mother. It certainly worked the other way around: he would have been terribly lonely without her. She no longer spoke about Mama, but every now and then she would put her arms around his neck and cling to him with desperation, as if frightened to let him go.

He felt regret only when he stood in front of the great cathedral at Chartres, sixty miles outside Paris. There were two towers at its west end. The north tower was unfinished, but the south tower was three hundred and fifty feet high. It reminded him that he had once yearned to design such buildings. He was unlikely to achieve that ambition in Kingsbridge.

He lingered in Paris for two weeks. The plague had not reached here, and it was an immense relief to see the normal life of a great city, with people buying and selling and walking around, instead of empty streets with corpses on the doorsteps. His spirits lifted, and it was only then that he realized how stricken he had been by the horror he had left behind in Florence. He looked at Paris's cathedrals and palaces, making sketches of details that interested him. He had a small notebook made of paper, a new writing material popular in Italy.

Leaving Paris, he teamed up with a noble family returning to Cherbourg. Hearing Lolla talk, the people assumed Merthin was Italian, and he did not disabuse them, for the English were hated passionately in northern France. With the family and their entourage, Merthin crossed Normandy at a leisurely pace, with Lolla on the saddle in front of him and their packhorse following on a leading rein, looking at those churches and abbeys that had survived the devastation of King Edward's invasion almost two years ago.

He could have moved faster, but he told himself he was making the most of an opportunity that might not come again, the chance to see a rich variety of architecture. However, when he was honest with himself he had to admit that he was afraid of what he might find when he reached Kingsbridge.

He was going home to Caris, but she would not be the same Caris he had left behind nine years ago. She might have changed, physically and mentally. Some nuns became grossly fat, their only pleasure in life being food. More likely, Caris might have become ethereally thin, starving herself in an ecstasy of self-denial. By now she could be obsessed with religion, praying all day and flagellating herself for imaginary sins. Or she might be dead.

Those were his wildest nightmares. In his heart he knew she would not be enormously fat or a religious fanatic. And if she were dead he would have heard, as he had heard of the death of her father, Edmund. She was going to be the same Caris, small and neat, quick-witted, organized, and determined. But he was seriously concerned about how she would receive him. How did she feel about him after nine years? Did she think of him with indifference, as a part of her past too remote to care about, the way he thought of, say, Griselda? Or did she still long for him, somewhere deep in her soul? He had no idea, and that was the true cause of his anxiety.

They sailed to Portsmouth and traveled with a party of traders. They left the group at Mudeford Crossing, the traders going on to Shiring while Merthin and Lolla forded the shallow river on horseback and took the Kingsbridge road. It was a pity, Merthin thought, that there was no visible sign of the way to Kingsbridge. He wondered how many traders continued on to Shiring simply because they did not realize that Kingsbridge was nearer.

It was a warm summer day, and the sun was shining when they came within sight of their destination. The first thing he saw was the top of the cathedral tower, visible over the trees. At least it had not fallen down, Merthin thought: Elfric's repairs had held for eleven years. It was a pity the tower could not be seen from Mudeford Crossing - what a difference that would make to the numbers visiting the town.

As they came closer, he began to suffer a strange mixture of excitement and fear that made him feel nauseous. For a few moments he was afraid he would have to dismount and throw up. He tried to make himself calm. What could happen? Even if Caris proved to have become indifferent to him, he would not die.

He saw several new buildings on the outskirts of the suburb of Newtown. The splendid new home he had built for Dick Brewer was no longer on the edge of Kingsbridge, for the town had grown past it.

He momentarily forgot his apprehension when he saw his bridge. It rose in an elegant curve from the riverbank and landed gracefully on the midstream island. On the far side of the island, the bridge sprang again to span the second channel. Its white stone gleamed in the sun. People and carts were crossing in both directions. The sight made his heart swell with pride. It was everything he had hoped it would be: beautiful, useful, and strong. I did that, he thought, and it's good.

But he suffered a shock when he got closer. The masonry of the nearer span was damaged around the central pier. He could see cracks in the stonework, repaired with iron braces in a clumsy fashion that bore the hallmark of Elfric. He was appalled. Brown dribbles of rust dripped from the nails that fixed the ugly braces in the stonework. The sight took him back eleven years, to Elfric's repairs to the old wooden bridge. Everyone can make mistakes, he thought, but people who don't learn from their mistakes just make the same ones again. 'Bloody fools,' he said aloud.

'Bloody fools,' Lolla repeated. She was learning English.

He rode on to the bridge. The roadbed had been finished properly, he was happy to see, and he was pleased with the design of the parapet, a sturdy barrier with a carved capstone that recalled the moldings in the cathedral.

Leper Island was still overrun with rabbits. Merthin continued to hold a lease on the island. In his absence, Mark Webber had been collecting rents from tenants, paying the nominal rent due to the priory every year, subtracting an agreed collection fee, and sending the balance annually to Merthin in Florence via the Caroli family. After all the deductions it was a small sum, but it grew a little every year.

Merthin's house on the island had an occupied look, the shutters open, the doorstep swept. He had arranged for Jimmie to live there. The boy must now be a man, he thought.

At the near end of the second span, an old man Merthin did not recognize sat in the sun collecting the tolls. Merthin paid him a penny. The man gave him a hard stare, as if trying to recall where he had seen him before, but he said nothing.

The town was both familiar and strange. Because it was almost the same, the changes struck Merthin as miraculous, as if they had happened overnight: a row of hovels knocked down and replaced by fine houses; a busy inn where once there had been a big gloomy house occupied by a wealthy widow; a well dried up and paved over; a gray house painted white.

He went to the Bell Inn on the main street, next to the priory gates. It was unchanged: a tavern in such a good location would probably last hundreds of years. He left his horses and baggage with a hostler and went inside, holding hands with Lolla.

The Bell was like taverns everywhere: a big front room furnished with rough tables and benches, and a back area where the barrels of beer and wine were racked and food was cooked. Because it was popular and profitable, the straw on the floor was changed frequently and the walls were freshly whitewashed, and in winter a huge fire blazed. Now, in the heat of summer, all the windows were open, and a mild breeze blew through the front room.

After a moment, Bessie Bell came out from the back. Nine years ago she had been a curvy girl; now she was a voluptuous woman. She looked at him without recognition, but he saw her appraise his clothes and judge him an affluent customer. 'Good day to you, traveler,' she said. 'What can we do to make you and your child comfortable?'

Merthin grinned. 'I'd like to take your private room, please, Bessie.'

She knew him as soon as he spoke. 'My soul!' she cried. 'It's Merthin Bridger!' He put out his hand to shake, but she threw her arms around him and hugged him. She had always had a soft spot for him. She released him and studied his face. 'Such a beard you've grown! I would have recognized you sooner otherwise. Is this your little girl?'

'Her name is Lolla.'

'Well, aren't you a pretty thing! Your mother must be beautiful.'

Merthin said: 'My wife died.'

'How sad. But Lolla is young enough to forget. My husband died, too.'

'I didn't know you were married.'

'I met him after you left. Richard Brown, from Gloucester. I lost him a year ago.'

'I'm sorry to hear that.'

'My father's gone to Canterbury, on a pilgrimage, so I'm running this tavern all on my own at the moment.'

'I always liked your father.'

'He was fond of you, too. He always takes to men with a bit of spirit. He was never very keen on my Richard.'

'Ah.' Merthin felt the conversation had become too intimate, too fast. 'What news of my parents?'

'They're not here in Kingsbridge. They're staying at your brother's new home in Tench.'

Merthin had heard, through Buonaventura, that Ralph had become lord of Tench. 'My father must be very pleased.'

'Proud as a peacock.' She smiled, then looked concerned. 'You must be hungry and tired. I'll tell the boys to take your bags upstairs, then I'll bring you a tankard of ale and some pottage.' She turned to go into the back room.

'That's kind, but...'

Bessie paused at the door.

'If you would give Lolla some soup, I'd be grateful. There's something I have to do.'

Bessie nodded. 'Of course.' She bent down to Lolla. 'Do you want to come with Auntie Bessie? I expect you could eat a piece of bread. Do you like new bread?'

Merthin translated the question into Italian, and Lolla nodded happily.

Bessie looked at Merthin. 'Going to see Sister Caris, are you?'

Absurdly, he felt guilty. 'Yes,' he said. 'She's still here, then?'

'Oh, yes. She's guest master at the nunnery now. I'll be surprised if she isn't prioress one day.' She took Lolla's hand and led her into the back room. 'Good luck,' she called over her shoulder.

Merthin went out. Bessie could be a little suffocating, but her affection was sincere, and it warmed his heart to be welcomed back with such enthusiasm. He entered the priory grounds. He paused to look at the soaring west front of the cathedral, almost two hundred years old now and as awe-inspiring as ever.

He noticed a new stone building to the north of the church, beyond the graveyard. It was a medium-size palace, with an imposing entrance and an upper story. It had been built close to where the old timber prior's house used to be, so presumably it had replaced that modest building as the residence of Godwyn. He wondered where Godwyn had found the money.

He went closer. The palace was very grand, but Merthin did not like the design. None of the levels related in any way to the cathedral that loomed over it. The details were careless. The top of the ostentatious doorcase blocked part of an upper-story window. Worst of all, the palace was built on a different axis from that of the church, so that it stood at an awkward angle.

It was Elfric's work, no doubt of that.

A plump cat sat on the doorstep in the sun. It was black with a white tip to its tail. It glared malevolently at Merthin.

He turned away and walked slowly to the hospital. The cathedral green was quiet and deserted: there was no market today. The excitement and apprehension rose again in his stomach. He might see Caris at any moment. He reached the entrance and went in. The long room looked brighter and smelled fresher than he remembered: everything had a scrubbed look. There were a few people lying on mattresses on the floor, most of them elderly. At the altar a young novice was saying prayers aloud. He waited for her to finish. He was so anxious that he was sure he felt more ill than the patients on the beds. He had come a thousand miles for this moment. Was it a wasted journey?

At last the nun said 'Amen' for the last time and turned around. He did not know her. She approached him and said politely: 'May God bless you, stranger.'

Merthin took a deep breath. 'I've come to see Sister Caris,' he said.





The nuns' chapter meetings now took place in the refectory. In the past they had shared with the monks the elegant octagonal chapter house at the northeast corner of the cathedral. Sadly, mistrust between monks and nuns was now so great that the nuns did not want to risk the monks' eavesdropping on their deliberations. So they met in the long bare room where they took their meals.

The nunnery officials sat behind a table, Mother Cecilia in the middle. There was no subprioress: Natalie had died a few weeks ago, at the age of fifty-seven, and Cecilia had not yet replaced her. On Cecilia's right was the treasurer, Beth, and her matricularius, Elizabeth, formerly Elizabeth Clerk. On Cecilia's left were the cellarer, Margaret, in charge of all supplies, and her subordinate Caris, the guest master. Thirty nuns sat on rows of benches facing the senior officials.

After the prayer and the reading, Mother Cecilia made her announcements. 'We have received a letter from our lord bishop in response to our complaint about Prior Godwyn stealing our money,' she said. There was a murmur of anticipation from the nuns.

The reply had been a long time coming. King Edward had taken almost a year to replace Bishop Richard. Earl William had lobbied hard for Jerome, his father's able administrator, but in the end Edward had chosen Henri of Mons, a relative of his wife's from Hainault in northern France. Bishop Henri had come to England for the ceremony, then traveled to Rome to be confirmed by the pope, then returned and settled into his palace at Shiring, before replying to Cecilia's formal letter of complaint.

Cecilia went on: 'The bishop declines to take any action over the theft, saying that the events took place during the time of Bishop Richard, and the past is past.'

The nuns gasped. They had accepted the delay patiently, feeling confident they would get justice in the end. This was a shocking rejection.

Caris had seen the letter earlier. She was not as astonished as the rest of the nuns. It was not so remarkable that the new bishop did not wish to begin his period of office by quarreling with the prior of Kingsbridge. The letter told her that Henri would be a pragmatic ruler, not a man of principle. He was no different, in that respect, from the majority of men who were successful in church politics.

However, she was no less disappointed for being unsurprised. The decision meant that she had to abandon, for the foreseeable future, her dream of building a new hospital where sick people could be isolated from healthy guests. She told herself she should not grieve: the priory had existed for hundreds of years without such a luxury, so it could wait another decade or more. On the other hand, it angered her to see the rapid spread of diseases like the vomiting sickness that Maldwyn Cook had brought to the Fleece Fair the year before last. No one understood exactly how these things were transmitted - by looking at a sick person, by touching him, or just by being in the same room - but there could be no doubt that many illnesses did hop from one victim to the next, and proximity was a factor. However, she had to forget all that for now.

A rumble of resentful muttering came from the nuns on the benches. Mair's voice rose above the others, saying: 'The monks will be cock-a-hoop.'

She was right, Caris thought. Godwyn and Philemon had got away with daylight robbery. They had always argued that it was not theft for the monks to use the nuns' money, since it was all for the glory of God in the end; and they would now consider that the bishop had vindicated them. It was a bitter defeat, especially for Caris and Mair.

But Mother Cecilia was not going to waste time on regrets. 'This is not the fault of any of us, except perhaps me,' she said. 'We have simply been too trusting.'

You trusted Godwyn, but I did not, Caris thought, but she kept her mouth clamped shut. She waited to hear what Cecilia would say next. She knew that the prioress was going to make changes among the nunnery officials, but no one knew what had been decided.

'However, we must be more careful in the future. We will build a treasury of our own, to which the monks will not have access; indeed, I hope they will not even know where it is. Sister Beth will retire as treasurer, with our thanks for long and faithful service, and Sister Elizabeth will take her place. I have complete faith in Elizabeth.'

Caris tried to control her face so that her disgust would not be seen. Elizabeth had testified that Caris was a witch. It was nine years ago, and Cecilia had forgiven Elizabeth, but Caris never would. However, that was not the only reason for Caris's antipathy. Elizabeth was sour and twisted, and her resentments interfered with her judgment. Such people could never be trusted, in Caris's opinion: they were always liable to make decisions based on their prejudices.

Cecilia went on: 'Sister Margaret has asked permission to step down from her duties, and Sister Caris will take her place as cellarer.'

Caris was disappointed. She had hoped to be made subprioress, Cecilia's deputy. She tried to smile as if pleased, but she found it difficult. Cecilia was obviously not going to appoint a subprioress. She would have two rival subordinates, Caris and Elizabeth, and let them fight it out. Caris caught Elizabeth's eye, and saw barely suppressed hatred in her look.

Cecilia went on: 'Under Caris's supervision, Sister Mair will become guest master.'

Mair beamed with pleasure. She was glad to be promoted and even happier that she would be working under Caris. Caris, too, liked the decision. Mair shared her obsession with cleanliness and her mistrust of priests' remedies such as bleeding.

Caris had not got what she wanted, but she tried to look happy as Cecilia announced a handful of lesser appointments. When the meeting closed, she went to Cecilia and thanked her.

'Don't imagine it was an easy decision,' the prioress said. 'Elizabeth has brains and determination, and she's steady where you're volatile. But you're imaginative, and you get the best out of people. I need you both.'

Caris could not argue with Cecilia's analysis of her. She really knows me, Caris thought ruefully; better than anyone else in the world, now that my father is dead and Merthin has gone. She felt a surge of affection. Cecilia was like a mother bird, always moving, always busy, taking care of her fledglings. 'I'll do everything I can to live up to your expectations,' Caris vowed.

She left the room. She needed to check on Old Julie. No matter what she said to the younger nuns, no one looked after Julie the way she did. It was as if they believed that a helpless old person did not need to be kept comfortable. Only Caris made sure Julie was given a blanket in cool weather, and got something to drink when she was thirsty, and was helped to the latrine at those times of day when habitually she needed to go. Caris decided to take her a hot drink, an infusion of herbs that seemed to cheer the old nun up. She went to her pharmacy and put a small pan of water on the fire to boil.

Mair came in and closed the door. 'Isn't this wonderful?' she said. 'We'll still be working together!' She threw her arms around Caris and kissed her lips.

Caris hugged her, then detached herself from the embrace. 'Don't kiss me like that,' she said.

'It's because I love you.'

'And I love you, too, but not in the same way.'

It was true. Caris was very fond of Mair. They had become highly intimate in France, when they had risked their lives together. Caris had even found herself attracted by Mair's beauty. One night in a tavern in Calais, when the two of them had had a room with a door that could be locked, Caris had at last succumbed to Mair's advances. Mair had fondled and kissed Caris in all her most private places, and Caris had done the same to Mair. Mair had said it was the happiest day of her life. Unfortunately, Caris had not felt the same. For her the experience was pleasant but not thrilling, and she had not wanted to repeat it.

'That's all right,' Mair said. 'As long as you love me, even just a little bit, I'm happy. You won't ever stop, will you?'

Caris poured boiling water on the herbs. 'When you're as old as Julie, I promise I'll bring you an infusion to keep you healthy.'

Tears came to Mair's eyes. 'That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me.'

Caris had not meant it to be a vow of eternal love. 'Don't be sentimental,' she said gently. She strained the infusion into a wooden cup. 'Let's go and check on Julie.'

They crossed the cloisters and entered the hospital. A man with a bushy red beard was standing near the altar. 'God bless you, stranger,' Caris said. The man seemed familiar. He did not reply to her greeting, but looked hard at her with intense golden brown eyes. Then she recognized him. She dropped the cup. 'Oh, God!' she said. 'You!'





The few moments before she saw him were exquisite, and Merthin knew he would treasure them all his life, whatever else happened. He stared hungrily at the face he had not seen for nine years, and remembered, with a shock that was like plunging into a cold river on a hot day, how dear that face had been to him. She had hardly changed at all: his fears had been groundless. She did not even look older. She would be thirty now, he calculated, but she was as slim and perky as she had been at twenty. She walked quickly into the hospital with an air of brisk authority, carrying a wooden cup full of some medicine; then she looked at him, paused, and dropped the cup.

He grinned at her, feeling happy.

'You're here!' she said. 'I thought you were in Florence!'

'I'm very pleased to be back,' he replied.

She looked at the liquid on the floor. The nun with her said: 'Don't worry about this, I'll clear up. Go and talk to him.' The second nun was pretty, and had tears in her eyes, Merthin noticed, but he was too excited to pay much attention.

Caris said: 'When did you come back?'

'I arrived an hour ago. You look well.'

'And you look...such a man.'

Merthin laughed.

She said: 'What made you decide to return?'

'It's a long story,' he replied. 'But I'd love to tell it to you.'

'We'll step outside.' She touched his arm lightly and led him out of the building. Nuns were not supposed to touch people, or to have private conversations with men, but for her such rules had always been optional. He was glad she had not acquired a respect for authority in the last nine years.

Merthin pointed to the bench by the vegetable garden. 'I sat on that seat with Mark and Madge Webber, the day you entered the convent, nine years ago. Madge told me you had refused to see me.'

She nodded. 'It was the most unhappy day of my life - but I knew that seeing you would make it even worse.'

'I felt the same way, except that I wanted to see you, no matter how miserable it made me.'

She gave him a direct look, her gold-flecked green eyes as candid as ever. 'That sounds a bit like a reproach.'

'Perhaps it is. I was very angry with you. Whatever you decided to do, I felt you owed me an explanation.' He had not intended the conversation to go this way, but he found he could not help himself.

She was unapologetic. 'It's really quite simple. I could hardly bear to leave you. If I had been forced to speak to you, I think I would have killed myself.'

He was taken aback. For nine years he had thought she had been selfish on that day of parting. Now it looked as if he had been the selfish one, in making such demands on her. She had always had this ability to make him revise his attitudes, he recalled. It was an uncomfortable process, but she was often right.

They did not sit on the bench, but turned away and walked across the cathedral green. The sky had clouded over, and the sun had gone. 'There is a terrible plague in Italy,' he said. 'They call it la moria grande.'

'I've heard about it,' she said. 'Isn't it in southern France, too? It sounds dreadful.'

'I caught the disease. I recovered, which is unusual. My wife, Silvia, died.'

She looked shocked. 'I'm so sorry,' she said. 'You must feel terribly sad.'

'All her family died, and so did all my clients. It seemed like a good moment to come home. And you?'

'I've just been made cellarer,' she said with evident pride.

To Merthin that seemed somewhat trivial, especially after the slaughter he had seen. However, such things were important in the life of the nunnery. He looked up at the great church. 'Florence has a magnificent cathedral,' he said. 'Lots of patterns in colored stone. But I prefer this: carved shapes, all the same shade.' As he studied the tower, gray stone against gray sky, it started to rain.

They went inside the church for shelter. A dozen or so people were scattered around the nave: visitors to the town looking at the architecture, devout locals praying, a couple of novice monks sweeping. 'I remember feeling you up behind that pillar,' Merthin said with a grin.

'I remember it, too,' she said, but she did not meet his eye.

'I still feel the same about you as I did on that day. That's the real reason I came home.'

She turned and looked at him with anger in her eyes. 'But you got married.'

'And you became a nun.'

'But how could you marry her - Silvia - if you loved me?'

'I thought I could forget you. But I never did. Then, when I thought I was dying, I realized I would never get over you.'

Her anger vanished as quickly as it had appeared, and tears came to her eyes. 'I know,' she said, looking away.

'You feel the same.'

'I never changed.'

'Did you try?'

She met his eye. 'There's a nun...'

'The pretty one who was with you in the hospital?'

'How did you guess?'

'She cried when she saw me. I wondered why.'

Caris looked guilty, and Merthin guessed she was feeling the way he had felt when Silvia used to say: 'You're thinking about your English girl.'

'Mair is dear to me,' Caris said. 'And she loves me. But...'

'But you didn't forget me.'

'No.'

Merthin felt triumphant, but he tried not to let it show. 'In that case,' he said, 'you should renounce your vows, leave the nunnery, and marry me.'

'Leave the nunnery?'

'You'll need first to get a pardon for the witchcraft conviction, I realize that, but I'm sure it can be done - we'll bribe the bishop and the archbishop and even the pope if necessary. I can afford it - '

She was not sure it would be as easy as he thought. But that was not her main problem. 'It's not that I'm not tempted,' she said. 'But I promised Cecilia I would vindicate her faith in me...I have to help Mair take over as guest master...we need to build a new treasury...and I'm the only one who takes care of Old Julie properly...'

He was bewildered. 'Is all that so important?'

'Of course it is!' she said angrily.

'I thought the nunnery was just old women saying prayers.'

'And healing the sick, and feeding the poor, and managing thousands of acres of land. It's at least as important as building bridges and churches.'

He had not anticipated this. She had always been skeptical of religious observance. She had gone into the nunnery under duress, when it was the only way to save her own life. But now she seemed to have grown to love her punishment. 'You're like a prisoner who is reluctant to leave the dungeon, even when the door is opened wide,' he said.

'The door isn't open wide. I would have to renounce my vows. Mother Cecilia - '

'We'll have to work on all these problems. Let's begin right away.'

She looked miserable. 'I'm not sure.'

She was torn, he could see. It amazed him. 'Is this you?' he said incredulously. 'You used to hate the hypocrisy and falsehood that you saw in the priory. Lazy, greedy, dishonest, tyrannical - '

'That's still true of Godwyn and Philemon.'

'Then leave.'

'And do what?'

'Marry me, of course.'

'Is that all?'

Once again he was bewildered. 'It's all I want.'

'No, it's not. You want to design palaces and castles. You want to build the tallest building in England.'

'If you need someone to take care of...'

'What?'

'I've got a little girl. Her name is Lolla. She's three.'

That seemed to settle Caris's mind. She sighed. 'I'm a senior official in a convent of thirty-five nuns, ten novices, and twenty-five employees, with a school and a hospital and a pharmacy - and you're asking me to throw all that up to nursemaid one little girl I've never met.'

He gave up arguing. 'All I know is that I love you and I want to be with you.'

She laughed humorlessly. 'If you had said that and nothing else, you might have talked me into it.'

'I'm confused,' he said. 'Are you refusing me, or not?'

'I don't know,' she said.
