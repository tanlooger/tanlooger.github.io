The hospital was full again. The plague, which had seemed to retreat during the first three months of 1349, came back in April with redoubled virulence. On the day after Easter Sunday, Caris looked wearily at the rows of mattresses crammed together in a herringbone pattern, packed so tightly that the masked nuns had to step gingerly between them. Moving around was a little easier, however, because there were so few family members at the bedsides of the sick. Sitting with a dying relative was dangerous - you were likely to catch the plague yourself - and people had become ruthless. When the epidemic began, they had stayed with their loved ones regardless, mothers with children, husbands with wives, the middle-aged with their elderly parents, love overcoming fear. But that had changed. The most powerful of family ties had been viciously corroded by the acid of death. Nowadays the typical patient was brought in by a mother or father, a husband or wife, who then simply walked away, ignoring the piteous cries that followed them out. Only the nuns, with their face masks and their vinegar-washed hands, defied the disease.

Surprisingly, Caris was not short of help. The nunnery had enjoyed an influx of novices to replace the nuns who had died. This was partly because of Caris's saintly reputation. But the monastery was experiencing the same kind of revival, and Thomas now had a class of novice monks to train. They were all searching for order in a world gone mad.

This time the plague had struck some leading townspeople who had previously escaped. Caris was dismayed by the death of John Constable. She had never much liked his rough-and-ready approach to justice - which was to hit troublemakers over the head with a stick and ask questions afterward - but it was going to be more difficult to maintain order without him. Fat Betty Baxter, baker of special buns for every town festivity, shrewd questioner at parish guild meetings, was dead, her business awkwardly shared out between four squabbling daughters. And Dick Brewer had died, the last of Caris's father's generation, a cohort of men who knew how to make money and how to enjoy it.

Caris and Merthin had been able to slow the spread of the disease by canceling major public gatherings. There had been no big Easter procession in the cathedral, and there would be no Fleece Fair this Whitsun. The weekly market was held outside the city walls, in Lovers' Field, and most townspeople stayed away. Caris had wanted such measures when the plague first struck, but Godwyn and Elfric had opposed her. According to Merthin, some Italian cities had even closed their gates for a period of thirty or forty days, called a trentine or a quarantine. It was now too late to keep the disease out, but Caris still thought restrictions would save lives.

One problem she did not have was money. More and more people bequeathed their wealth to the nuns, having no surviving relatives, and many of the new novices brought with them lands, flocks, orchards, and gold. The nunnery had never been so rich.

It was small consolation. For the first time in her life she felt tired - not just weary from hard work, but drained of energy, short of willpower, enfeebled by adversity. The plague was worse than ever, killing two hundred people a week, and she did not know how she was going to carry on. Her muscles ached, her head hurt, and sometimes her vision seemed to blur. Where would it end? she wondered dismally. Would everyone die?

Two men staggered in through the door, both bleeding. Caris hurried forward. Before she got within touching distance, she picked up the sweetly rotten smell of drink on them. They were both nearly helpless, although it was not yet dinnertime. She groaned in frustration: this was all too common.

She knew the men vaguely: Barney and Lou, two strong youngsters employed in the abattoir owned by Edward Slaughterhouse. Barney had one arm hanging limp, possibly broken. Lou had a dreadful injury to his face: his nose was crushed and one eye was a ghastly pulp. Both seemed too drunk to feel pain. 'It was a fight,' Barney slurred, his words only just comprehensible. 'I didn't mean it. He's my best friend. I love him.'

Caris and Sister Nellie got the two drunks lying down on adjacent mattresses. Nellie examined Barney and said his arm was not broken but dislocated, and sent a novice to fetch Matthew Barber, the surgeon, who would try to relocate it. Caris bathed Lou's face. There was nothing she could do to save his eye: it had burst like a soft-boiled egg.

This kind of thing made her furious. The two men were not suffering from a disease or an accidental injury: they had harmed one another while drinking to excess. After the first wave of the plague, she had managed to galvanize the townspeople into restoring law and order; but the second wave had done something terrible to people's souls. When she called again for a return to civilized behavior, the response had been apathetic. She did not know what to do next, and she felt so tired.

As she contemplated the two maimed men lying shoulder to shoulder on the floor, she heard a strange noise from outside. For an instant, she was transported back three years, to the battle of CrÃ©cy, and the terrifying booming sound made by King Edward's new machines that shot stone balls into the enemy ranks. A moment later the noise came again and she realized it was a drum - several drums, in fact, being struck in no particular rhythm. Then she heard pipes and bells whose notes failed to form any kind of tune; then hoarse cries, wailing, and shouts that might have indicated triumph or agony, or both. It was not unlike the noise of battle, but without the swish of deadly arrows or the screams of maimed horses. Frowning, she went outside.

A group of forty or so people had come onto the cathedral green, dancing a mad antic jig. Some played on musical instruments, or rather sounded them, for there was no melody or harmony to the noise. Their flimsy light-colored clothes were ripped and stained, and some were half-naked, carelessly exposing the intimate parts of their bodies. All those who did not have instruments were carrying whips. A crowd of townspeople followed, staring in curiosity and amazement.

The dancers were led by Friar Murdo, fatter than ever but cavorting energetically, sweat pouring down his dirty face and dripping from his straggly beard. He led them to the great west door of the cathedral, where he turned to face them. 'We have all sinned!' he roared.

His followers cried out in response, inarticulate shrieks and groans.

'We are dirt!' he said thrillingly. 'We wallow in lasciviousness like pigs in filth. We yield, quivering with desire, to our fleshly lusts. We deserve the plague!'

'Yes!'

'What must we do?'

'Suffer!' they called. 'We must suffer!'

One of the followers dashed forward, flourishing a whip. It had three leather thongs, each of which appeared to have sharp stones attached to a knot. He threw himself at Murdo's feet and began to lash his own back. The whip tore the thin material of his robe and drew blood from the skin of his back. He cried out in pain, and the rest of Murdo's followers groaned in sympathy.

Then a woman came forward. She pulled her robe down to her waist and turned, exposing her bare breasts to the crowd; then lashed her bare back with a similar whip. The followers moaned again.

As they came forward in ones and twos, flogging themselves, Caris saw that many of them had bruises and half-healed cuts on their skin: they had done this before, some of them many times. Did they go from town to town repeating the performance? Given Murdo's involvement, she felt sure that sooner or later someone would start collecting money.

A woman in the watching crowd suddenly ran forward screaming: 'Me, too, I must suffer!' Caris was surprised to see that it was Mared, the browbeaten young wife of Marcel Chandler. Caris could not imagine that she had committed many sins, but perhaps she had at last seen a chance to make her life dramatic. She threw off her dress and stood stark naked before the friar. Her skin was unmarked; in fact she looked beautiful.

Murdo gazed at her for a long moment then said: 'Kiss my feet.'

She knelt in front of him, exposing her rear obscenely to the crowd, and lowered her face to his filthy feet.

He took a whip from another penitent and handed it to her. She lashed herself, then shrieked in pain, and red marks appeared instantly on her white skin.

Several more ran forward eagerly from the crowd, mostly men, and Murdo went through the same ritual with each. Soon there was an orgy. When they were not whipping themselves they were banging their drums and clanging their bells and dancing their fiendish jig.

Their actions had a mad abandon, but Caris's professional eye noted that the strokes of the whips, though dramatic and undoubtedly painful, did not appear to inflict permanent damage.

Merthin appeared beside Caris and said: 'What do you think of this?'

She frowned and said: 'Why does it make me feel indignant?'

'I don't know.'

'If people want to whip themselves, why should I object? Perhaps it makes them feel better.'

'I agree with you, though,' Merthin said. 'There's generally something fraudulent about anything Murdo is involved with.'

'That's not it.'

The mood here was not one of penitence, she decided. These dancers were not looking back contemplatively over their lives, feeling sorrow and regret for sins committed. People who genuinely repented tended to be quiet, thoughtful, and undemonstrative. What Caris sensed in the air here was quite different. It was excitement.

'This is a debauch,' she said.

'Only instead of drink, they're overindulging in self-loathing.'

'And there's a kind of ecstasy in it.'

'But no sex.'

'Give them time.'

Murdo led the procession off again, heading out of the priory precincts. Caris noticed that some of the flagellants had produced bowls and were begging coins from the crowd. They would go through the principal streets of the town like this, she guessed. They would probably finish up at one of the larger taverns, where people would buy them food and drink.

Merthin touched her arm. 'You look pale,' he said. 'How do you feel?'

'Just tired,' she said curtly. She had to soldier on regardless of how she felt, and it did not help her to be reminded of her tiredness. However, it was kind of him to notice, and she softened her tone to say: 'Come to the prior's house. It's almost dinnertime.'

They walked across the green as the procession disappeared. They stepped inside the palace. As soon as they were alone, Caris put her arms around Merthin and kissed him. She suddenly felt very physical, and she thrust her tongue into his mouth, which she knew he liked. In response, he took both her breasts in his hands and squeezed gently. They had never kissed like this inside the palace, and Caris wondered vaguely whether something about Friar Murdo's bacchanal had weakened her normal inhibitions.

'Your skin is hot,' Merthin said in her ear.

She wanted Merthin to pull down her robe and put his mouth to her nipples. She felt she was losing control, and might find herself recklessly making love right here on the floor, where they might so easily be caught.

Then a girl's voice said: 'I didn't mean to spy.'

Caris was shocked. She sprang guiltily away from Merthin. She turned around, looking for the speaker. At the far end of the room, sitting on a bench, was a young woman holding a baby. It was Ralph Fitzgerald's wife. 'Tilly!' said Caris.

Tilly stood up. She looked exhausted and frightened. 'I'm so sorry to startle you,' she said.

Caris was relieved. Tilly had attended the nuns' school and lived at the nunnery for years, and she was fond of Caris. She could be trusted not to make a fuss about the kiss she had seen. But what was she doing here? 'Are you all right?' Caris said.

'I'm a bit tired,' Tilly said. She staggered, and Caris caught her arm.

The baby cried. Merthin took the child and rocked him expertly. 'There, there, my little nephew,' he said. The crying fell to a mild grizzle of discontent.

Caris said to Tilly: 'How did you get here?'

'I walked.'

'From Tench Hall? Carrying Gerry?' The baby was now six months old, and no easy burden.

'It took me three days.'

'My goodness. Has something happened?'

'I ran away.'

'Didn't Ralph come after you?'

'Yes, with Alan. I hid in the forest while they went by. Gerry was very good and didn't cry.'

The picture brought a lump to Caris's throat. 'But...' She swallowed. 'But why did you run away?'

'Because my husband wants to kill me,' Tilly said, and she burst into tears.

Caris sat her down and Merthin brought her a cup of wine. They let her sob. Caris sat on the bench beside her and put an arm around her shoulders while Merthin cradled baby Gerry. When at last Tilly had cried herself out, Caris said: 'What has Ralph done?'

Tilly shook her head. 'Nothing. It's just the way he looks at me. I know he wants to murder me.'

Merthin muttered: 'I wish I could say my brother is incapable of that.'

Caris said: 'But why would he want to do such a terrible thing?'

'I don't know,' Tilly said miserably. 'Ralph went to Uncle William's funeral. There was a lawyer from London there, Sir Gregory Longfellow.'

'I know him,' Caris said. 'A clever man, but I don't like him.'

'It started after that. I have a feeling it's all to do with Gregory.'

Caris said: 'You wouldn't have walked all this way, carrying a baby, because of something you just imagined.'

'I know it sounds fanciful, but he just sits and glares at me hatefully. How can a man look at his wife like that?'

'Well, you've come to the right place,' Caris said. 'You're safe here.'

'Can I stay?' she begged. 'You won't send me back, will you?'

'Certainly not,' said Caris. She caught Merthin's eye. She knew what he was thinking. It would be rash to give Tilly a guarantee. Fugitives might take refuge in churches, as a general principle, but it was very doubtful whether a nunnery had the right to shelter a knight's wife and keep her from him indefinitely. Moreover Ralph would certainly be entitled to make her give up the baby, his son and heir. All the same, Caris put as much confidence into her voice as she could and said: 'You can stay here just as long as you like.'

'Oh, thank you.'

Caris silently prayed that she would be able to keep her promise.

'You could live in one of the special guest rooms upstairs in the hospital,' she said.

Tilly looked troubled. 'But what if Ralph should come in?'

'He wouldn't dare. But if it makes you feel safer, you can have Mother Cecilia's old room, at the end of the nuns' dormitory.'

'Yes, please.'

A priory servant came in to lay the table for dinner. Caris said to Tilly: 'I'll take you to the refectory. You can have dinner with the nuns, then lie down in the dormitory and rest.' She stood up.

Suddenly she felt dizzy. She put a hand on the table to steady herself. Merthin, still holding baby Gerry, said anxiously: 'What's wrong?'

'I'll be fine in a moment,' Caris said. 'I'm just tired.'

Then she fell to the floor.





Merthin felt a tidal wave of panic. For an instant, he was stunned. Caris had never been ill, never helpless - she was the one who took care of the sick. He could not think of her as a victim.

The moment passed like a blink. Fighting down his fear, he carefully handed the baby to Tilly.

The servant girl had stopped laying the table and stood staring in shock at the unconscious form of Caris on the floor. Merthin deliberately made his voice calm but urgent and said to her: 'Run to the hospital and tell them Mother Caris is ill. Bring Sister Oonagh. Go on now, as quick as you can!' She hurried away.

Merthin knelt beside Caris. 'Can you hear me, my darling?' he said. He picked up her limp hand and patted it, then touched her cheek, then lifted an eyelid. She was out cold.

Tilly said: 'She's got the plague, hasn't she?'

'Oh, God.' Merthin took Caris in his arms. He was a slight man, but he had always been able to lift heavy objects, building stones and timber beams. He lifted her easily and stood upright, then laid her gently on the table. 'Don't die,' he whispered. 'Please don't die.'

He kissed her forehead. Her skin was hot. He had felt it when they embraced a few minutes ago, but he had been too excited to worry. Perhaps that was why she had been so passionate: fever could have that effect.

Sister Oonagh came in. Merthin was so grateful to see her that tears came to his eyes. She was a young nun, only a year or two out of her novitiate, but Caris thought highly of her nursing skill and was grooming her to take responsibility for the hospital one day.

Oonagh wrapped a linen mask over her mouth and nose and tied it in a knot behind her neck. Then she touched Caris's forehead and cheek. 'Did she sneeze?' she said.

Merthin wiped his eyes. 'No,' he answered. He felt sure he would have noticed: a sneeze was an ominous sign.

Oonagh pulled down the front of Caris's robe. To Merthin she looked agonizingly vulnerable with her small breasts exposed. But he was glad to see there was no rash of purple-black spots on her chest. Oonagh covered her up again. She looked up Caris's nostrils. 'No bleeding,' she said. She felt Caris's pulse thoughtfully.

After a few moments she looked at Merthin. 'This may not be the plague, but it seems a serious illness. She's feverish, her pulse is rapid, and her breathing is shallow. Carry her upstairs, lay her down, and bathe her face with rose water. Anyone who attends her must wear a mask and wash their hands as if she had the plague. That includes you.' She gave him a linen strip.

Tears rolled down his face as he tied the mask. He carried Caris upstairs, put her on the mattress in her room, and straightened her clothing. The nuns brought rose water and vinegar. Merthin told them of Caris's instructions regarding Tilly, and they took the young mother and baby to the refectory. Merthin sat beside Caris, patting her forehead and cheeks with a rag damped with the fragrant liquid, praying for her to come round.

At last she did. She opened her eyes, frowned in puzzlement, then looked anxious and said: 'What happened?'

'You fainted,' he said.

She tried to sit up.

'Keep still,' he said. 'You're sick. It's probably not the plague, but you have a serious illness.'

She must have felt weak, for she lay back on the pillow without further protest. 'I'll just rest for an hour,' she said.

She was in bed for two weeks.





After three days the whites of her eyes turned the color of mustard, and Sister Oonagh said she had the yellow jaundice. Oonagh prepared an infusion of herbs sweetened with honey, which Caris drank hot three times a day. The fever receded, but Caris remained weak. She inquired anxiously about Tilly every day, and Oonagh answered her questions, but refused to discuss any other aspect of life in the nunnery, in case it should tire Caris. Caris was too enfeebled to fight her.

Merthin did not leave the prior's palace. In the daytime he sat downstairs, close enough to hear her call, and his employees came to him for instructions about the various buildings they were putting up or tearing down. At night he lay on a mattress beside her and slept lightly, waking every time her breathing changed or she turned over in her bed. Lolla slept in the next room.

At the end of the first week, Ralph showed up.

'My wife has disappeared,' he said as he walked into the hall of the prior's palace.

Merthin looked up from a drawing he was making on a large slate. 'Hello, brother,' he said. Ralph looked shifty, he thought. Clearly he had mixed feelings about Tilly's disappearance. He was not fond of her, but on the other hand no man likes his wife to run away.

Perhaps I have mixed feelings, too, Merthin thought guiltily. After all, I did help his wife to leave him.

Ralph sat on a bench. 'Have you got any wine? I'm parched.'

Merthin went to the sideboard and poured from a jug. It crossed his mind to say he had no idea where Tilly could be, but his instinct revolted from the idea of lying to his own brother, especially about something so important. Besides, Tilly's presence at the priory could not be kept secret: too many nuns, novices, and employees had seen her here. It was always best to be honest, Merthin thought, except in dire emergency. Handing the cup to Ralph, he said: 'Tilly is here, at the nunnery, with the baby.'

'I thought she might be.' Ralph lifted the cup in his left hand, showing the stumps of his three severed fingers. He took a long draft. 'What's the matter with her?'

'She ran away from you, Ralph.'

'You should have let me know.'

'I feel bad about that. But I couldn't betray her. She's frightened of you.'

'Why take sides with her against me? I'm your brother!'

'Because I know you. If she's scared, there's probably a reason.'

'This is outrageous.' Ralph was trying to appear indignant, but the act was unconvincing.

Merthin wondered what he really felt.

'We can't throw her out,' Merthin said. 'She's asked for sanctuary.'

'Gerry's my son and heir. You can't keep him from me.'

'Not indefinitely, no. If you start a legal action, I'm sure you'll win. But you wouldn't try to separate him from his mother, would you?'

'If he comes home, she will.'

That was probably true. Merthin was casting around for another way of persuading Ralph when Brother Thomas came in, bringing Alan Fernhill with him. With his one hand, Thomas was holding Alan's arm, as if to prevent him from running away. 'I found him snooping,' he said.

'I was just looking around,' Alan protested. 'I thought the monastery was empty.'

Merthin said: 'As you see, it's not. We've got one monk, six novices, and a couple of dozen orphan boys.'

Thomas said: 'Anyway, he wasn't in the monastery, he was in the nuns' cloisters.'

Merthin frowned. He could hear a psalm being sung in the distance. Alan had timed his incursion well: all the nuns and novices were in the cathedral for the service of Sext. Most of the priory buildings were deserted at this hour. Alan had probably been walking around unhindered for some time.

This did not seem like idle curiosity.

Thomas added: 'Fortunately, a kitchen hand saw him and came to fetch me out of the church.'

Merthin wondered what Alan had been looking for. Tilly? Surely he would not have dared to snatch her from a nunnery in broad daylight. He turned to Ralph. 'What are you two plotting?'

Ralph batted the question off to Alan. 'What did you think you were doing?' he said wrathfully, though Merthin thought the anger was faked.

Alan shrugged. 'Just looking around while I waited for you.'

It was not plausible. Idle men-at-arms waited for their masters in stables and taverns, not cloisters.

Ralph said: 'Well...don't do it again.'

Merthin realized that Ralph was going to stick with this story. I was honest with him, but he's not being honest with me, he thought sadly. He returned to the more important subject. 'Why don't you leave Tilly be for a while?' he said to Ralph. 'She'll be perfectly all right here. And perhaps, after a while, she'll realize you mean her no harm, and come back to you.'

'It's too shaming,' Ralph said.

'Not really. A noblewoman sometimes spends a few weeks at a monastery, if she feels the need to retire from the world for a while.'

'Usually when she's been widowed, or her husband has gone off to war.'

'Not always, though.'

'When there's no obvious reason, people always say she wants to get away from her husband.'

'How bad is that? You might like some time away from your wife.'

'Perhaps you're right,' Ralph said.

Merthin was startled by this response. He had not expected Ralph to be so easily persuaded. It took him a moment to get over the surprise. Then he said: 'That's it. Give her three months, then come back and talk to her.' Merthin had a feeling that Tilly would never relent, but at least this proposal would postpone the crisis.

'Three months,' said Ralph. 'All right.' He stood up to go.

Merthin shook his hand. 'How are Mother and Father? I haven't seen them for months.'

'Getting old. Father doesn't leave their house now.'

'I'll come and visit as soon as Caris is better. She's recovering from yellow jaundice.'

'Give her my best wishes.'

Merthin went to the door and watched Ralph and Alan ride away. He felt deeply disturbed. Ralph was up to something, and it was not simply getting Tilly back.

He returned to his drawing and sat staring at it without seeing it for a long time.





By the end of the second week it was clear that Caris was going to get better. Merthin was exhausted but happy. Feeling like a man reprieved, he put Lolla to bed early and went out for the first time.

It was a mild spring evening, and the sun and balmy air made him light-headed. His own tavern, the Bell, was closed for rebuilding, but the Holly Bush was doing brisk business, customers sitting on benches outside with their tankards. There were so many people out enjoying the weather that Merthin stopped and asked the drinkers if it was a holiday today, thinking he might have lost track of the date. 'Every day's a holiday now,' one said. 'What's the point in working, when we're all going to die of the plague? Have a cup of ale.'

'No, thanks.' Merthin walked on.

He noticed that many people wore very fancy clothes, elaborate headgear and embroidered tunics that they would not normally have been able to afford. He presumed they had inherited these garments, or perhaps just taken them from wealthy corpses. The effect was a bit nightmarish: velvet hats on filthy hair, gold threads and food stains, ragged hose and jewel-encrusted shoes.

He saw two men dressed all in women's clothing, floor-length gowns and wimples. They were walking along the main street arm in arm, like merchants' wives showing off their wealth - but they were unmistakably male, with big hands and feet and hair on their chins. Merthin began to feel disoriented, as if nothing could be relied on anymore.

As the dusk thickened, he crossed the bridge to Leper Island. He had built a street of shops and taverns there, between the two parts of the bridge. The work was finished, but the buildings were untenanted, with boards nailed across their doors and windows to keep vagrants out. No one lived there but rabbits. The premises would remain empty until the plague died out, and Kingsbridge returned to normal, Merthin supposed. If the plague never went away, they would never be occupied; but, in that eventuality, renting his property would be the least of his worries.

He returned to the old city just as the gate was closing. There seemed to be a huge party going on at the White Horse Tavern. The house was full of lights, and the crowd filled the road in front of the building. 'What's going on?' Merthin asked a drinker.

'Young Davey's got the plague, and he has no heirs to bequeath the inn to, so he's giving all the ale away,' the man said, grinning with delight. 'Drink as much as you can hold, it's free!'

He and many other people had clearly been working on the same principle, and dozens of them were reeling drunk. Merthin pushed his way into the crowd. Someone was banging a drum and others were dancing. He saw a circle of men and looked over their shoulders to see what they were hiding. A very drunk woman of about twenty years was bending over a table while a man entered her from behind. Several other men were clearly waiting their turn. Merthin turned away in distaste. At the side of the building, half-concealed by empty barrels, his eye lit on Ozzie Ostler, a wealthy horse dealer, kneeling in front of a younger man and sucking his penis. That was against the law, in fact the penalty was death, but clearly no one cared. Ozzie, a married man who was on the parish guild, caught Merthin's eye but did not stop, in fact he continued with more enthusiasm, as if excited by being watched. Merthin shook his head, amazed. Just outside the tavern door was a table laden with partly eaten food: joints of roasted meat, smoked fish, puddings, and cheese. A dog was standing on the table tearing at a ham. A man was throwing up into a bowl of stew. Beside the tavern door Davey Whitehorse sat in a big wooden chair with a huge cup of wine. He was sneezing and sweating, and the characteristic trickle of blood came from his nose, but he was looking around and cheering the revelers on. He seemed to want to kill himself with drink before the plague finished him off.

Merthin felt nauseated. He left the scene and hurried back to the priory.

To his surprise, he found Caris up and dressed. 'I'm better,' she said. 'I'm going to return to my usual work tomorrow.' Seeing his skeptical look, she added: 'Sister Oonagh said I could.'

'If you're taking orders from someone else, you can't be back to normal,' he said; and she laughed. The sight brought tears to his eyes. She had not laughed for two weeks, and there had been moments when he had wondered whether he would ever hear the sound again.

'Where have you been?' she asked.

He told her about his walk around the town, and the disturbing sights he had seen. 'None of it was very wicked,' he said. 'I just wonder what they'll do next. When all their inhibitions have gone, will they start to kill one another?'

A kitchen hand brought a tureen of soup for their supper. Caris sipped warily. For a long time, all food had made her feel sick. However, she seemed to find the leek soup palatable, and drank a bowlful.

When the maid had cleared away, Caris said: 'While I was ill, I thought a lot about dying.'

'You didn't ask for a priest.'

'Whether I've been good or bad, I don't think God will be fooled by a last-minute change of heart.'

'What, then?'

'I asked myself if there was anything I really regretted.'

'And was there?'

'Lots of things. I'm bad friends with my sister. I haven't any children. I lost that scarlet coat my father gave my mother on the day she died.'

'How did you lose it?'

'I wasn't allowed to bring it with me when I entered the nunnery. I don't know what happened to it.'

'What was your biggest regret?'

'There were two. I haven't built my hospital; and I've spent too little time in bed with you.'

He raised his eyebrows. 'Well, the second one is easily rectified.'

'I know.'

'What about the nuns?'

'Nobody cares anymore. You saw what it was like in the town. Here in the nunnery, we're too busy dealing with the dying to fuss about the old rules. Joan and Oonagh sleep together every night in one of the upstairs rooms of the hospital. It doesn't matter.'

Merthin frowned. 'It's odd that they do that, and still go to church services in the middle of the night. How do they reconcile the two things?'

'Listen. St. Luke's Gospel says: 'He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none.' How do you think the bishop of Shiring reconciles that with his chest full of robes? Everybody takes what they like from the teachings of the church, and ignores the parts that don't suit them.'

'And you?'

'I do the same, but I'm honest about it. So I'm going to live with you, as your wife, and if anyone questions me I shall say that these are strange times.' She got up, went to the door, and barred it. 'You've been sleeping here for two weeks. Don't move out.'

'You don't have to lock me in,' he said with a laugh. 'I'll stay voluntarily.' He put his arms around her.

She said: 'We started something a few minutes before I fainted. Tilly interrupted us.'

'You were feverish.'

'In that way, I still am.'

'Perhaps we should pick up where we left off.'

'We could go to bed first.'

'All right.'

Holding hands, they went up the stairs.
