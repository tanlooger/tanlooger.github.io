Caris was unable to find out the truth about Mattie Wise. Some people said she had been captured and was locked in a cell in the priory. Others thought she would be tried in her absence. A third strand of opinion claimed that someone else entirely would stand trial for heresy. Godwyn refused to answer Caris's questions, and the rest of the monks said they knew nothing.

Caris went to the cathedral on Saturday morning determined to defend Mattie whether she was present or not, and to stand up for any other poor old woman who suffered this absurd accusation. Why did monks and priests hate women so? They worshipped their Blessed Virgin, but treated every other female as an incarnation of the devil. What was the matter with them?

In a secular court there would have been a jury of indictment and a preliminary hearing, and Caris would have been able to find out in advance what the evidence against Mattie might be. But the church made its own rules.

Whatever they alleged, Caris would say loud and clear that Mattie was a genuine healer who used herbs and drugs and told people to pray to God to make them well. Some of the many townspeople who had been helped by Mattie would surely speak up for her.

Caris stood with Merthin in the north transept and remembered the Saturday two years ago when Crazy Nell had been tried. Caris had told the court Nell was mad but harmless. It had done no good.

Today, as then, there was a big crowd of townspeople and visitors in the cathedral, hoping for drama: accusations, counteraccusations, quarrels, hysterics, curses, and the spectacle of a woman being flogged through the streets and then hanged at Gallows Cross. Friar Murdo was present. He always showed up for sensational trials. They provided an opportunity for him to do what he did best: whip up hysteria in a congregation.

While they were waiting for the clergy, Caris's mind wandered. Tomorrow, in this church, she would marry Merthin. Betty Baxter and her four daughters were already busy making the bread and pastry for the feast. Tomorrow night, Caris and Merthin would sleep together in his house on Leper Island.

She had stopped worrying about the marriage. She had made her decision and she would take the consequences. In truth she felt very happy. Sometimes she wondered how she could have been so scared. Merthin could not make anyone his slave - it was not in his nature. He was even kind to his boy laborer Jimmie.

Most of all she loved their sexual intimacy. It was the best thing that had ever happened to her. What she looked forward to most was having a home and a bed of their own, and being able to make love whenever they wanted to, on going to bed or on waking up, in the middle of the night or even the middle of the day.

At last the monks and nuns came in, led by Bishop Richard with his assistant, Archdeacon Lloyd. When they had taken their seats, Prior Godwyn stood up and said: 'We are here today to try the charge of heresy against Caris, daughter of Edmund Wooler.'

The crowd gasped.

Merthin shouted: 'No!'

Everyone turned to look at Caris. She felt sick with fear. She had had no suspicion of this. It hit her like a punch in the dark. Bewildered, she said: 'Why?' No one answered her.

She remembered her father warning her that Godwyn would have an extreme reaction to the threat of a borough charter. 'You know how ruthless he is, even over small disputes,' Edmund had said. 'Something like this will lead to total war.' Caris shuddered now to remember her reply: 'So be it - total war.'

Even so, Godwyn's chance of success would have been slender indeed if her father had been in good health. Edmund would have fought Godwyn to a standstill, and probably destroyed him. But Caris alone was a different matter. She did not have her father's power, authority, or popular support - not yet. Without him, she had become vulnerable.

She noticed her aunt Petranilla in the crowd. She was one of the few people not looking at Caris. How could she stand there in silence? Of course she supported her son, Godwyn, in general - but surely she would try to stop him condemning Caris to death? She had once said she wanted to be like a mother to Caris. Would she remember that? Somehow, Caris felt she would not. Her devotion to her son was too great. That was why she could not meet Caris's eye. She had already made up her mind not to stand in Godwyn's way.

Philemon stood up. 'My lord bishop,' he said, formally addressing the judge. But he immediately turned to the crowd. 'As everyone knows, the woman Mattie Wise has fled, too frightened and guilty to be tried. Caris has been a regular visitor to Mattie's house for some years. Only days ago she defended the woman, in front of witnesses, here in the cathedral.'

So that was why Philemon had questioned her about Mattie, Caris realized. She caught Merthin's eye. He had been worried because he could not figure out what Philemon was up to. He had been right to worry. Now they knew.

At the same time, part of her mind marveled at the transformation of Philemon. That awkward, unhappy boy was now a confident, arrogant man, standing in front of the bishop, the prior, and the townspeople, as full of spite as a snake about to strike.

Philemon said: 'She offered to swear on oath that Mattie is no witch. Why would she do that - unless to cover her own guilt?'

Merthin shouted out: 'Because she's innocent, and so is Mattie, you mendacious hypocrite!'

He might have been put in the stocks for that, but others were shouting at the same time, and his insult passed without comment.

Philemon went on: 'Recently, Caris has miraculously dyed wool the exact shade of Italian scarlet, something Kingsbridge dyers have never been able to do. How has this been achieved? By a magic spell!'

Caris heard the rumble of Mark Webber's bass voice: 'This is a lie!'

'She could not do this by daylight, of course. She lit a fire in her backyard at night, as was seen by people living nearby.'

Philemon had been assiduous, Caris noted with foreboding. He had interviewed her neighbors.

'And she chanted strange rhymes. Why?' Caris had sung to herself out of boredom, as she boiled up dyes and dipped the cloth, but Philemon had the ability to turn innocent trivia into evidence of evil. He dropped his voice to a thrilling stage whisper and said: 'Because she was calling for the secret aid of the Prince of Darkness...,' he raised his voice to a shout, '...Lucifer!'

The crowd groaned with dread.

'That cloth is Satan's scarlet!'

Caris looked at Merthin. He was aghast. 'The fools are starting to believe him!' he said.

Caris's courage began to return. 'Don't despair,' she said. 'I haven't had my say yet.'

He took her hand.

'This is not the only spell she has used,' Philemon continued in a more normal voice. 'Mattie Wise also made love potions.' He looked accusingly around the crowd. 'There may even be wicked girls in this church now who have made use of Mattie's powers to bewitch a man.'

Including your own sister, Caris thought. Did Philemon know about that?

He said: 'This novice nun will testify.'

Elizabeth Clerk stood up. She spoke in a quiet voice, eyes lowered, the picture of nunlike modesty. 'I say this on my oath as I hope to be saved,' she began. 'I was betrothed to Merthin Builder.'

Merthin called out: 'Liar!'

'We were in love and very happy,' Elizabeth went on. 'Suddenly he changed. He seemed like a stranger to me. He became cold.'

Philemon asked her: 'Did you notice anything else unusual, Sister?'

'Yes, Brother. I saw him hold his knife in his left hand.'

The crowd gasped. This was an acknowledged sign of bewitchment - although, as Caris knew, Merthin was ambidextrous.

Elizabeth said: 'Then he announced he was going to marry Caris.'

It was amazing, Caris thought, how the truth could be just a little skewed so that it sounded sinister. She knew what had really happened. Merthin and Elizabeth had been friends until Elizabeth made it clear she wanted to be more than a friend, at which point he had told her that he did not share her feelings, and they had parted. But a satanic spell made a much better story.

Elizabeth might have convinced herself that she was telling the truth. But Philemon knew this was a lie. And Philemon was Godwyn's tool. How could Godwyn reconcile his conscience with this level of wickedness? Was he telling himself that anything was justified in the service of the priory?

Elizabeth finished: 'I can never love another man. That is why I have decided to give my life to God.' She sat down.

It was powerful evidence, Caris realized, and her dismay darkened like a winter sky. The fact that Elizabeth had become a nun lent conviction to her testimony. She was operating a kind of sentimental blackmail: How can you disbelieve me when I have made such a sacrifice?

The townspeople were quieter now. This was not the hilarious spectacle of a mad old woman being condemned. They were watching a battle for the life of a fellow citizen.

Philemon said: 'Most damning of all, my lord bishop, is the final witness, a close member of the accused woman's own family: her brother-in-law, Elfric Builder.'

Caris gasped. She had been accused by her cousin, Godwyn; by her best friend's brother, Philemon; and by Elizabeth - but this was worse. For her sister's husband to speak against her was astonishing treachery. Surely no one would ever respect Elfric again.

Elfric stood up. The expression of defiance on his face told Caris he was ashamed of himself. 'I say this on my oath as I hope to be saved,' he began.

Caris looked around for her sister, Alice, but did not see her. If she had been here, she would surely have stopped Elfric. No doubt Elfric had ordered her to stay at home on some pretext. She probably knew nothing of this.

Elfric said: 'Caris speaks to unseen presences in empty rooms.'

'Spirits?' Philemon prompted.

'I fear so.'

A murmur of horror came from the crowd.

Caris was aware that she often talked aloud to herself. She had always thought of it as a harmless, if mildly embarrassing, habit. Her father said all imaginative people did it. Now it was being used to condemn her. She bit back a protest. It was better to let the prosecution run its course, then refute the accusations one by one.

'When does she do this?' Philemon asked Elfric.

'When she thinks she is alone.'

'And what does she say?'

'The words are difficult to make out. She might be speaking a foreign tongue.'

The crowded reacted to that, too: witches and their familiars were said to have their own language that no one else could understand.

'What does she seem to be saying?'

'To judge by her tone of voice, she is asking for help, pleading for good luck, cursing those who cause her misfortune, that sort of thing.'

Merthin shouted: 'This is not evidence!' Everyone looked at him, and he added: 'He has admitted he did not understand the words - he's just making this up!'

There was a rumble of support from the more levelheaded citizens, but it was not as loud or as indignant as Caris would have liked.

Bishop Richard spoke for the first time. 'Be quiet,' he said. 'Men who disrupt the proceedings will be put outside by the constable. Carry on, please, Brother Philemon, but do not invite witnesses to fabricate evidence when they have admitted they do not know the truth.'

That was at least evenhanded, Caris thought. Richard and his family had no love for Godwyn after the quarrel over Margery's wedding. On the other hand, as a cleric Richard might not want the town to pass out of the priory's control. Perhaps he would at least be neutral in this. Her hopes rose a little.

Philemon said to Elfric: 'Do you think the familiars she speaks to help her in any way?'

'Most certainly,' Elfric replied. 'Caris's friends, those she favors, are lucky. Merthin has become a successful builder although he never even completed his apprenticeship as a carpenter. Mark Webber was a poor man, but now he is rich. Caris's friend Gwenda is married to Wulfric, even though Wulfric was betrothed to someone else. How are these things achieved, if not with unnatural help?'

'Thank you.'

Elfric sat down.

As Philemon summarized his evidence, Caris fought down a rising feeling of terror. She tried to put out of her mind the vision of Crazy Nell being flogged behind a cart. She struggled to concentrate on what she should say to defend herself. She could ridicule every statement made about her, but that might not be enough. She needed to explain why people had lied about her, and show what their motives were.

When Philemon was finished, Godwyn asked her if she had anything to say. In a loud voice that sounded more confident than she felt, she replied: 'Of course I do.' She made her way to the front of the crowd: she would not let her accusers monopolize the position of authority. She took her time, making them all wait for her. She walked up to the throne and looked Richard in the eye. 'My lord bishop, I say this on my oath as I hope to be saved...,' she turned to the crowd and added, '...which I notice Philemon did not say.'

Godwyn interrupted: 'As a monk, he does not need to swear.'

Caris raised her voice. 'And a good thing for him, otherwise he would burn in Hell for the lies he has told today!'

Score a point to me, she thought, and her hopes rose another notch.

She spoke to the crowd. Although the decision would be made by the bishop, he would be heavily influenced by the reaction of the townspeople. He was not a man of high principle.

'Mattie Wise healed many people in this town,' she began. 'On this day two years ago, when the old bridge collapsed, she was one of the foremost in tending to the injured, working alongside Mother Cecilia and the nuns. Looking around the church today I see many people who benefited from her care at that terrible time. Did anyone hear her invoke the devil on that day? If so, let him speak now.'

She paused to let the silence impress itself on her audience.

She pointed at Madge Webber. 'Mattie gave you a potion that brought down your child's fever. What did she say to you?'

Madge looked scared. No one was comfortable being called as a witness in the defense of a witch. But Madge owed a lot to Caris. She straightened her shoulders, looked defiant, and said: 'Mattie said to me: 'Pray to God, for only He can heal.''

Caris pointed at the constable. 'John, she eased your pain while Mathew Barber set your broken bones. What did she say to you?'

John was used to being on the prosecuting side, and he, too, looked uneasy, but he told the truth in a strong voice. 'She said: 'Pray to God, for only He can heal.''

Caris turned to the crowd. 'Everyone knows that Mattie was no witch. In that case, says Brother Philemon, why did she flee? Easy question. She was afraid that lies would be told about her - as they have been told about me. Which of you women, if falsely accused of heresy, would feel confident about proving your innocence to a court of priests and monks?' She looked around, letting her eyes rest on the prominent women of the town: Lib Wheeler, Sarah Taverner, Susanna Chepstow.

'Why did I mix dyes at night?' she resumed. 'Because the days were short! Like many of you, my father failed to sell all his fleeces last year, and I wanted to turn the raw wool into something I could market. It was very difficult to discover the formula, but I did it, by hard work, over many hours, day and night - but without the help of Satan.' She paused for breath.

When she began again, she used a different tone of voice, more playful. 'I am accused of bewitching Merthin. I have to admit that the case against me is strong. Look at Sister Elizabeth. Stand up, please, Sister.'

Reluctantly, Elizabeth stood.

'She is beautiful, isn't she?' Caris said. 'She is also clever. And she is the daughter of a bishop. Oh, forgive me, my lord bishop, I meant no disrespect.'

The crowd chuckled at that cheeky stab. Godwyn looked outraged, but Bishop Richard smothered a smile.

'Sister Elizabeth cannot see why any man would prefer me to her. Nor can I. Unaccountably, Merthin loves me, plain as I am. I cannot explain it.' There was more giggling. 'I'm sorry Elizabeth is so angry. If we lived in Old Testament times, Merthin could have two wives and everyone would be happy.' They laughed loudly at that. She waited for the sound to subside, then said gravely: 'What I am most sorry about is that the commonplace jealousy of a disappointed woman should become the pretext, in the untrustworthy mouth of a novice monk, for a charge as serious as that of heresy.'

Philemon stood up to protest the charge of untrustworthiness, but Bishop Richard flapped a hand at him, saying: 'Let her speak, let her speak.'

Caris decided she had made her point about Elizabeth, and moved on. 'I confess that I sometimes use vulgar words when I am alone - especially if I stub my toe. But you may ask why my own brother-in-law would testify against me, and tell you that my mutterings were invocations to evil spirits. I'm afraid I can answer that.' She paused, then spoke solemnly. 'My father is ill. If he dies, his fortune will be divided between me and my sister. But, if I die first, my sister will get it all. And my sister is Elfric's wife.'

She paused, looking quizzically at the crowd. 'Are you shocked?' she said. 'So am I. But men kill for less money than that.'

She moved away, as if she had finished, and Philemon got up from his bench. Caris turned around and addressed him in Latin. 'Caput tuum in ano est.'

The monks laughed loudly, and Philemon flushed.

Caris turned to Elfric. 'You didn't understand that, did you, Elfric?'

'No,' he said sulkily.

'Which is why you might have thought I was using some sinister witchcraft tongue.' She turned back to Philemon. 'Brother, you know what language I was using, don't you?'

'Latin,' Philemon replied.

'Perhaps you would tell us what I just said to you.'

Philemon looked an appeal at the bishop. But Richard was amused, and just said: 'Answer the question.'

Looking furious, Philemon obeyed. 'She said: 'You've got your head up your ass.''

The townspeople roared with laughter, and Caris walked back to her place.

When the noise died down, Philemon began to speak, but Richard interrupted him. 'I don't need to hear any further from you,' he said. 'You've made a strong case against her, and she has mounted a vigorous defense. Does anyone else have anything to say about this accusation?'

'I do, my lord bishop.' Friar Murdo came forward. Some of the townspeople cheered, others groaned: Murdo aroused contrary reactions. 'Heresy is an evil,' he began, his voice modulating into fruity preaching mode. 'It corrupts the souls of women and men - '

'Thank you, Brother, but I know what heresy does,' said Richard. 'Do you have anything else to say? If not - '

'Just this,' Murdo replied. 'I agree with, and reiterate - '

'If it has been said before - '

' - your own comment that the case is strong, and the defense similar.'

'In which case - '

'I have a solution to propose.'

'All right, Brother Murdo, what is it? In the minimum number of words.'

'She must be examined for the Devil's Mark.'

Caris's heart seemed to stop.

'Of course,' said the bishop. 'I seem to remember you making the same suggestion at an earlier trial.'

'Indeed, lord, for the devil greedily sucks the hot blood of his acolytes through his own special nipple, as the newborn babe sucks the swollen breasts - '

'Yes, thank you, friar, no need for further details. Mother Cecilia, will you and two other nuns please take the accused woman to a place of examination?'

Caris looked at Merthin. He was pale with horror. They were both thinking the same.

Caris had a mole.

It was tiny, but the nuns would find it - in just the kind of place they thought the devil was most interested in: on the left side of her vulva, just beside the cleft. It was dark brown, and the red gold hair around did not hide it. The first time Merthin had noticed it, he had joked: 'Friar Murdo would call you a witch - you'd better not let him see it.' And Caris had laughed and said: 'Not if he were the last man on earth.'

How could they have spoken of it in such a carefree way? Now she would be condemned to death for it.

She looked around desperately. She would have run, but she was surrounded by hundreds of people, some of whom would stop her. She saw Merthin's hand on the knife at his belt; but even if the knife had been a sword and he had been a great fighter - which he was not - he could not have cut his way through such a crowd.

Mother Cecilia came to her and took her hand.

Caris decided she would escape as soon as she got outside the church. Crossing the cloisters she could easily break free.

Then Godwyn said: 'Constable, take one of your deputies and escort the woman to the place of examination, and stand outside the door until it is done.'

Cecilia could not have held Caris, but two men could.

John looked at Mark Webber, normally his first choice among the deputies. Caris felt a faint hope: Mark was a loyal friend to her. But the constable apparently had the same thought, for he turned from Mark and pointed to Christopher Blacksmith.

Cecilia tugged gently on Caris's hand.

As if sleepwalking, Caris allowed herself to be led out of the church. They left by the north door, Cecilia and Caris followed by Sister Mair and Old Julie, with John Constable and Christopher Blacksmith close behind. They crossed the cloisters, entered the nuns' quarters, and made their way to the dormitory. The two men stayed outside.

Cecilia closed the door.

'No need to examine me,' Caris said dully. 'I've got a mark.'

'We know,' said Cecilia.

Caris frowned. 'How?'

'We have washed you.' She indicated Mair and Julie. 'All three of us. When you were in the hospital, two Christmases ago. You had eaten something that poisoned you.'

Cecilia did not know, or was pretending not to have guessed, that Caris had taken a potion to end her pregnancy.

She went on: 'You were puking and shitting all over the place, and bleeding down there. You had to be washed several times. We all saw the mole.'

Hopeless despair washed over Caris in an irresistible tide. She closed her eyes. 'So now you will condemn me to death,' she said in a voice so low it was almost a whisper.

'Not necessarily,' said Cecilia. 'There could be another way.'





Merthin was distraught. Caris was trapped. She would be condemned to death, and there was nothing he could do. He could not have rescued her even if he had been Ralph, with big shoulders and a sword and a relish for violence. He stared, horrified, at the door through which she had disappeared. He knew where Caris's mole was, and he felt sure the nuns would find it - that was just the kind of place where they would look most carefully.

All around him the noise of excited chatter rose from the crowd. People were arguing for or against Caris, rerunning the trial, but he seemed to be inside a bubble, and he could hardly follow what anyone said. In his ears, their talk sounded like the random beating of a hundred drums.

He found himself staring at Godwyn, wondering what he was thinking. Merthin could understand the others - Elizabeth was eaten up with jealousy, Elfric was possessed by greed, and Philemon was pure malevolence - but the prior mystified him. Godwyn had grown up with his cousin Caris, and he knew she was not a witch. Yet he was prepared to see her die. How could he do something so wicked? What excuse did he make to himself? Did he tell himself that this was all for the glory of God? Godwyn had once seemed to be a man of enlightenment and decency, the antidote to Prior Anthony's narrow conservatism. But he had turned out to be worse than Anthony: more ruthless in the pursuit of the same obsolete aims.

If Caris dies, Merthin thought, I'm going to kill Godwyn.

His parents came up to him. They had been in the cathedral throughout the trial. His father said something, but Merthin could not understand him. 'What?' he said.

Then the north door opened, and the crowd became silent. Mother Cecilia walked in alone and closed the door behind her. There was a murmur of curiosity. What now?

Cecilia walked up to the bishop's throne.

Richard said: 'Well, Mother Prioress? What do you have to report to the court?'

Cecilia said slowly: 'Caris has confessed - '

There was a roar of shock from the crowd.

Cecilia raised her voice. '...confessed her sins.'

They went quiet again. What did this mean?

'She has received absolution - '

'From whom?' Godwyn interrupted. 'A nun cannot give absolution!'

'From Father Joffroi.'

Merthin knew Joffroi. He was the priest at St. Mark's, the church where Merthin had repaired the roof. Joffroi had no love for Godwyn.

But what was going on? Everyone waited for Cecilia to explain.

She said: 'Caris has applied to become a novice nun here at the priory - '

Once again she was interrupted by a shout of shock from the assembled townspeople.

She yelled over their voices: ' - and I have accepted her!'

There was uproar. Merthin could see Godwyn yelling at the top of his voice, but his words were lost. Elizabeth was enraged; Philemon stared at Cecilia with poisonous hatred; Elfric looked bewildered; Richard was amused. Merthin's own mind reeled with the implications. Would the bishop accept this? Did it mean the trial was over? Had Caris been saved from execution?

Eventually the tumult died down. As soon as he could be heard, Godwyn spoke, his face white with fury. 'Did she, or did she not, confess to heresy?'

'The confessional is a sacred trust,' Cecilia replied imperturbably. 'I don't know what she said to the priest, and if I did I could not tell you or anyone else.'

'Does she bear the mark of Satan?'

'We did not examine her.' This answer was evasive, Merthin realized, but Cecilia quickly added: 'It was not necessary once she had received absolution.'

'This is unacceptable!' Godwyn bellowed. He had dropped the pretense that Philemon was the prosecutor. 'The prioress cannot frustrate the proceedings of the court in this way!'

Bishop Richard said: 'Thank you, Father Prior - '

'The order of the court must be carried out!'

Richard raised his voice. 'That will do!'

Godwyn opened his mouth to protest further, then thought better of it.

Richard said: 'I don't need to hear any more argument. I have made my decision, and I will now announce my judgment.'

Silence fell.

'The proposal that Caris be permitted to enter the nunnery is an interesting one. If she is a witch, she will be unable to do any harm in the holiness of her surroundings. The devil cannot enter here. On the other hand, if she is not a witch, we will have been saved from the error of condemning an innocent woman. Perhaps the nunnery would not have been Caris's choice as a way of life, but her consolation will be an existence dedicated to serving God. On balance, then, I find this a satisfactory solution.'

Godwyn said: 'What if she should leave the nunnery?'

'Good point,' said the bishop. 'That is why I am formally sentencing her to death, but suspending the sentence for as long as she remains a nun. If she should renounce her vows, the sentence would be carried out.'

That's it, thought Merthin in despair; a life sentence; and he felt tears of rage and grief come to his eyes.

Richard stood up. Godwyn said: 'The court is adjourned!' The bishop left, followed by the monks and nuns in procession.

Merthin moved in a daze. His mother spoke to him in a consoling voice, but he ignored her. He let the crowd carry him to the great west door of the cathedral and out on to the green. The traders were packing up their leftover goods and dismantling their stalls: the Fleece Fair was over for another year. Godwyn had got what he wanted, he realized. With Edmund dying and Caris out of the way, Elfric would become alderman and the application for a borough charter would be withdrawn.

He looked at the gray stone walls of the priory buildings: Caris was in there somewhere. He turned that way, moving across the tide of the crowd, and headed for the hospital.

The place was empty. It had been swept clean, and the straw-filled palliasses used by the overnight visitors were stacked neatly against the walls. A candle burned on the altar at the eastern end. Merthin walked slowly the length of the room, not sure what to do next.

He recalled, from Timothy's Book, that his ancestor Jack Builder had briefly become a novice monk. The author had hinted that Jack had been a reluctant recruit, and had not taken easily to monastic discipline; at any rate, his novitiate had ended abruptly in circumstances over which Timothy drew a tactful veil.

But Bishop Richard had stated that if Caris ever left the nunnery she would be under sentence of death.

A young nun came in. When she recognized Merthin she looked scared. 'What do you want?' she said.

'I must speak to Caris.'

'I'll go and ask,' she said, and hurried out.

Merthin looked at the altar, and the crucifix, and the triptych on the wall showing Elizabeth of Hungary, the patron saint of hospitals. One panel showed the saint, who had been a princess, wearing a crown and feeding the poor; the second showed her building her hospital; and the third illustrated the miracle in which the food she carried beneath her cloak was turned into roses. What would Caris do in this place? She was a skeptic, doubtful of just about everything the church taught. She did not believe that a princess could turn bread into roses. 'How do they know that?' she would say to stories that everyone else accepted without question - Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, David and Goliath, even the Nativity. She would be a caged wildcat in here.

He had to talk to her, to find out what was in her mind. She must have some plan that he was not able to guess at. He waited impatiently for the nun to return. She did not come back, but Old Julie appeared. 'Thank heaven!' he said. 'Julie, I have to see Caris, quickly!'

'I'm sorry, young Merthin,' she said. 'Caris doesn't want to see you.'

'Don't be ridiculous,' he said. 'We're betrothed - we're supposed to get married tomorrow. She has to see me!'

'She's a novice nun now. She won't be getting married.'

Merthin raised his voice. 'If that's true, don't you think she should tell me herself?'

'It's not for me to say. She knows you're here, and she won't see you.'

'I don't believe you.' Merthin pushed past the old nun and went through the door by which she had entered. He found himself in a small lobby. He had never been here before: few men had ever entered the nuns' area of the priory. He passed through another door and found himself in the nuns' cloisters. Several of them stood there, some reading, some walking around the square meditatively, some talking in quiet voices.

He ran along the arcade. A nun caught sight of him and screamed. He ignored her. Seeing a staircase, he ran up it and entered the first room. He found himself in a dormitory. There were two lines of mattresses, with neatly folded blankets on top. No one was there. He went a few steps along the corridor and tried another door. It was locked. 'Caris!' he shouted. 'Are you in there? Speak to me!' He banged on the door with his fist. He scraped the skin of his knuckles, which started to bleed, but he hardly felt the pain. 'Let me in!' he yelled. 'Let me in!'

A voice behind him said: 'I'll let you in.'

He spun around to see Mother Cecilia.

She took a key from her belt and calmly unlocked the door. Merthin threw it open. Beyond it was a small room with a single window. All around the walls were shelves packed with folded clothes.

'This is where we keep our winter robes,' Cecilia said. 'It's a storeroom.'

'Where is she?' Merthin shouted.

'She's in a room that is locked by her own request. You won't find the room and, if you did, you couldn't get in. She will not see you.'

'How do I know she's not dead?' Merthin heard his voice crack with emotion, but he did not care.

'You know me,' Cecilia said. 'She's not dead.' She looked at his hand. 'You've hurt yourself,' she said sympathetically. 'Come with me and let me put some ointment on your cuts.'

He looked at his hand, and then at her. 'You're a devil,' he said.

He ran from her, back the way he had come, into the hospital, past a scared-looking Julie, out into the open. He made his way through the end-of-fair chaos in front of the cathedral and emerged onto the main street. He thought of speaking to Edmund, but decided against it: someone else could tell Caris's ailing father the terrible truth. Whom could he trust? He thought of Mark Webber.

Mark and his family had moved to a big house on the main street, with a large stone-built ground-floor storeroom for bales of cloth. There was no loom in their kitchen now: all the weaving was done by others whom they organized. Mark and Madge were sitting on a bench, looking solemn. When Merthin walked in, Mark jumped up. 'Have you seen her?' he cried.

'They won't let me.'

'That's outrageous!' Mark said. 'They don't have the right to stop her seeing the man she's supposed to marry!'

'The nuns say she doesn't want to see me.'

'I don't believe them.'

'Nor do I. I went in and looked for her, but I couldn't find her. There are a lot of locked doors.'

'She must be there somewhere.'

'I know. Will you come back with me, and bring a hammer, and help me break down every door until we find her?'

Mark looked uncomfortable. Strong as he was, he hated violence.

Merthin said: 'I have to find her - she might be dead!'

Before he could reply, Madge said: 'I've got a better idea.'

The two men looked at her.

'I'll go to the nunnery,' Madge said. 'The nuns won't be so nervous of a woman. Perhaps they will persuade Caris to see me.'

Mark nodded. 'At least then we'll know that she's alive.'

Merthin said: 'But...I need more than that. What is she thinking? Is she going to wait until the fuss dies down, then escape? Should I try to break her out of there? Or should I just wait - and, if so, how long? A month? A year? Seven years?'

'I'll ask her, if they'll let me in.' Madge stood up. 'You wait here.'

'No, I'm coming with you,' Merthin said. 'I'll wait outside.'

'In that case, Mark, why don't you come, too, to keep Merthin company?'

To keep Merthin out of trouble, she meant, but he made no objection. He had asked for their help. And he was grateful to have two people he trusted on his side.

They hurried back to the priory close. Mark and Merthin waited outside the hospital while Madge went in. Merthin saw that Caris's old dog, Scrap, was sitting at the door, waiting for her to reappear.

After Madge had been gone for half an hour, Merthin said: 'I think they must have let her in, otherwise she'd be back by now.'

'We'll see,' said Mark.

They watched the last of the traders pack up and depart, leaving the cathedral green a sea of churned mud. Merthin paced up and down while Mark sat like a statue of Samson. One hour followed another. Despite his impatience, Merthin was glad of the delay, for almost certainly Madge was talking to Caris.

The sun was sinking over the west side of town when at last Madge emerged. Her expression was solemn and her face was wet with tears. 'Caris is alive,' she said. 'And there's nothing wrong with her, physically or mentally. She's in her right mind.'

'What did she say?' Merthin asked urgently.

'I'll tell you every word. Come, let's sit in the garden.'

They went to the vegetable patch and sat on the stone bench, looking at the sunset. Madge's equanimity gave Merthin a bad feeling. He would have preferred her to be spitting with rage. Her manner told him the news was bad. He felt hopeless. He said: 'Is it true that she doesn't want to see me?'

Madge sighed. 'Yes.'

'But why?'

'I asked her that. She said it would break her heart.'

Merthin began to cry.

Madge went on in a low, clear voice. 'Mother Cecilia left us alone, so that we could speak frankly, without being overheard. Caris believes that Godwyn and Philemon are determined to get rid of her, because of the application for a borough charter. She's safe in the nunnery, but if she ever leaves they will find her and kill her.'

'She could escape and I could take her to London!' Merthin said. 'Godwyn would never find us there!'

Madge nodded. 'I said that to her. We discussed it for a long time. She feels the two of you would be fugitives for the rest of your lives. She's not willing to condemn you to that. It's your destiny to be the greatest builder of your generation. You will be famous. But, if she is with you, you will always have to lie about your identity and hide from the light of day.'

'I don't care about that!'

'She told me you would say that. But she believes you do care about it, and what is more she thinks you should. Anyway, she cares about it. She will not take away your destiny, even if you ask her to.'

'She could say this to me herself!'

'She's afraid you would talk her around.'

Merthin knew Madge was telling the truth. Cecilia had been telling the truth, too. Caris did not want to see him. He felt choked with grief. He swallowed, wiped the tears from his face with his sleeve, and struggled to speak. 'But what will she do?' he said.

'Make the best of it. Try to be a good nun.'

'She hates the church!'

'I know she has never been very respectful of the clergy. In this town, it's not surprising. But she believes she can find some kind of consolation in a life dedicated to healing her fellow women and men.'

Merthin thought about that. Mark and Madge watched him in silence. He could imagine Caris working in the hospital, taking care of sick people. But how would she feel about spending half the night singing and praying? 'She might kill herself,' he said after a long pause.

'I don't think so,' Madge said with conviction. 'She's terribly sad, but I don't see her taking that way out.'

'She might kill someone else.'

'That's more likely.'

'Then again,' Merthin said slowly and reluctantly, 'she might find a kind of happiness.'

Madge said nothing. Merthin looked hard at her. She nodded.

That was the terrible truth, he realized. Caris might be happy. She was losing her home, her freedom, and her husband-to-be; but she might still be happy, in the end.

There was nothing more to say.

Merthin stood up. 'Thank you for being my friends,' he said. He began to walk away.

Mark said: 'Where are you going?'

Merthin stopped and turned back. There was a thought spinning in his head, and he waited for it to become clear. When it did, he was astonished. But he saw immediately that the idea was right. It was not merely right, it was perfect.

He wiped the tears from his face and looked at Mark and Madge in the red light of the dying sun.

'I'm going to Florence,' he said. 'Good-bye.'
