Caris watched the early stages of the battle from the far side of the valley. She saw the Genoese crossbowmen try to flee, only to be cut down by knights of their own side. Then she saw the first great charge, with the colors of Charles of AlenÃ§on leading thousands of knights and men-at-arms.

She had never seen battle, and she was utterly sickened. Hundreds of knights fell to the English arrows, to be trampled by the hooves of the great warhorses. She was too far away to be able to follow the hand-to-hand fighting, but she saw the swords flash and the men fall, and she wanted to weep. As a nun, she had seen severe injuries - men who had fallen from high scaffolding, hurt themselves with sharp tools, suffered hunting accidents - and she always felt the pain and the waste of a lost hand, a crushed leg, a damaged brain. To see men inflicting such wounds on one another intentionally revolted her.

For a long time it seemed the fight could go either way. If she had been at home, hearing news of the war from afar, she might have hoped for an English victory; but after what she had seen in the last two weeks she felt a sort of disgusted neutrality. She could not identify with the English who had murdered peasants and burned their crops, and it made no difference to her that they had committed these atrocities in Normandy. Of course, they would say the French deserved what they got because they had burned Portsmouth, but that was a stupid way to think - so stupid that it led to scenes of horror such as this.

The French retreated, and she assumed they would regroup and reorganize, and wait for the king to arrive to develop a new battle plan. They still had overwhelming superiority in numbers, she could see: there were tens of thousands of troops in the valley, with more still arriving.

But the French did not regroup. Instead, every new battalion that arrived went straight into the attack, throwing themselves suicidally up the hill at the English position. The second and subsequent charges fared worse than the first. Some were cut down by archers even before they reached the English lines; the rest were beaten off by foot soldiers. The slope below the ridge became shiny with the gushing blood of hundreds of men and horses.

After the first charge, Caris looked only occasionally at the battle. She was too busy tending those French wounded who were lucky enough to be able to leave the field. Martin Chirurgien had realized that she was as good a surgeon as he. Giving her free access to his instruments, he left her and Mair to work independently. They washed, sewed, and bandaged hour after hour.

News of prominent casualties came back to them from the front line. Charles of AlenÃ§on was the first high-ranking fatality. Caris could not help feeling that he deserved his fate. She had witnessed his foolish enthusiasm and careless indiscipline. Hours later, King Jean of Bohemia was reported dead, and she wondered what madness drove a blind man to battle.

'In God's name, why don't they stop?' she said to Martin when he brought her a cup of ale to refresh her.

'Fear,' he replied. 'They're scared of disgrace. To leave the field without striking a blow would be shameful. They would prefer to die.'

'A lot of them have had that wish granted,' said Caris grimly, and she emptied her tankard and went back to work. Her knowledge and understanding of the human body was growing by leaps and bounds, she reflected. She saw inside every part of a living man: the brains beneath shattered skulls, the pipework of the throat, the muscles of the arms sliced open, the heart and lungs within smashed rib cages, the slimy tangle of the intestines, the articulation of the bones at hip and knee and ankle. She discovered more in an hour on the battlefield than in a year at the priory hospital. This was how Matthew Barber had learned so much, she realized. No wonder he was confident.

The carnage continued until night fell. The English lit torches, afraid of a sneak attack under cover of darkness. But Caris could have told them they were safe. The French were routed. She could hear the calls of French soldiers searching the battlefield for fallen kinsmen and comrades. The king, who had arrived in time to join one of the last hopeless charges, left the field. After that the exit became general.

A fog came up from the river, filling the valley and obscuring the distant flares. Once again, Caris and Mair worked by firelight long into the night, patching up the wounded. All those who could walk or hobble left as soon as they could, putting as much distance as possible between themselves and the English, hoping to avoid tomorrow's inevitable bloodthirsty mopping-up operation. When Caris and Mair had done all they could for the victims, they slipped away.

This was their chance.

They located their ponies and led them forward by the light of a burning torch. They reached the bottom of the valley and found themselves in noman's-land. Hidden by fog and darkness, they slipped out of their boys' clothing. For a moment they were terribly vulnerable, two naked women in the middle of a battlefield. But no one could see them, and a second later they were pulling their nuns' robes over their heads. They packed up their male garments in case they should need them again: it was a long way home.

Caris decided to abandon the torch, in case an English archer should take it into his head to shoot at the light and ask questions afterward. Holding hands so that they would not get separated they went forward, still leading the horses. They could see nothing: the fog obscured whatever light might have come from moon or stars. They headed uphill toward the English lines. There was a smell like a butcher's shop. So many bodies of horses and men covered the ground that they could not walk around them. They had to grit their teeth and step on the corpses. Soon their shoes were covered with a mixture of mud and blood.

The bodies on the ground thinned out, and soon there were none. Caris began to feel a deep sense of relief as she approached the English army. She and Mair had traveled hundreds of miles, lived rough for two weeks, and risked their lives, for this moment. She had almost forgotten the outrageous theft by Prior Godwyn of one hundred and fifty pounds from the nuns' treasury - the reason for her journey. Somehow it seemed less important after all this bloodshed. Still, she would appeal to Bishop Richard and win justice for the nunnery.

The walk seemed farther than Caris had imagined when she looked across the valley in daylight. She wondered nervously if she had become disoriented. She might have turned in the wrong direction and just walked straight past the English. Perhaps the army was now behind her. She strained to hear some noise - ten thousand men could not be silent, even if most of them had fallen into exhausted sleep - but the fog muffled sound.

She clung to the conviction that, as King Edward had positioned his forces on the highest land, she must be approaching him as long as she was walking uphill. But the blindness was unnerving. If there had been a precipice, she would have stepped right over it.

The light of dawn was turning the fog to the color of pearl when at last she heard a voice. She stopped. It was a man speaking in a low murmur. Mair squeezed her hand nervously. Another man spoke. She could not make out the language. She feared that she might have walked in a full circle and arrived back on the French side.

She turned toward the voice, still holding Mair's hand. The red glow of flames became visible through the gray mist, and she headed for it gratefully. As she came nearer, she heard the talk more clearly, and realized with immense relief that the men were speaking English. A moment later she made out a group of men around a fire. Several lay asleep, rolled in blankets, but three sat upright, legs crossed, looking into the flames, talking. A moment later Caris saw a man standing, peering into the fog, presumably on sentry duty, though the fact that he had not noticed her approach proved his job was impossible.

To get their attention, Caris said in a low voice: 'God bless you, men of England.'

She startled them. One gave a shout of fear. The sentry said belatedly: 'Who goes there?'

'Two nuns from Kingsbridge Priory,' Caris said. The men stared at her in superstitious dread, and she realized they thought she might be an apparition. 'Don't worry, we're flesh and blood, and so are these ponies.'

'Did you say Kingsbridge?' said one of them in surprise. 'I know you,' he said, standing up. 'I've seen you before.'

Caris recognized him. 'Lord William of Caster,' she said.

'I am the earl of Shiring, now,' he said. 'My father died of his wounds an hour ago.'

'May his soul rest in peace. We have come here to see your brother, Bishop Richard, who is our abbot.'

'You're too late,' William said. 'My brother, too, is dead.'





Later in the morning, when the fog had lifted and the battlefield looked like a sunlit slaughterhouse, Earl William took Caris and Mair to see King Edward.

Everyone was astonished at the tale of the two nuns who had followed the English army all through Normandy, and soldiers who had faced death only yesterday were fascinated by their adventures. William told Caris that the king would want to hear the story from her own lips.

Edward III had been king for nineteen years, but he was still only thirty-three years old. Tall and broad-shouldered, he was imposing rather than handsome, with a face that might have been molded for power: a big nose, high cheekbones, and luxuriant long hair just beginning to recede from his high forehead. Caris saw why people called him a lion.

He sat on a stool in front of his tent, fashionably dressed in two-colored hose and a cape with a scalloped border. He wore no armor or weapons: the French had vanished, and in fact a force of vengeful troops had been sent out to hunt down and kill any stragglers. A handful of barons stood around.

As Caris told how she and Mair had sought food and shelter in the devastated landscape of Normandy, she wondered if the king felt criticized by her tale of hardship. However, he seemed not to think the sufferings of the people reflected on him. He was as delighted with her exploits as if he were hearing of someone who had been brave during a shipwreck.

She ended by telling him of her disappointment on finding, after all her travails, that Bishop Richard, from whom she had hoped for justice, was dead. 'I beg Your Majesty to order the prior of Kingsbridge to restore to the nuns the money he stole.'

Edward smiled ruefully. 'You're a brave woman, but you know nothing of politics,' he said with condescension. 'The king can't get involved in an ecclesiastical quarrel such as this. We would have all our bishops banging on our door in protest.'

That might be so, Caris reflected, but it did not prevent the king interfering with the church when it suited his own purposes. However, she said nothing.

Edward went on: 'And it would do your cause harm. The church would be so outraged that every cleric in the land would oppose our ruling, regardless of its merits.'

There might be something in that, she judged. But he was not as powerless as he pretended. 'I know you will remember the wronged nuns of Kingsbridge,' she said. 'When you appoint the new bishop of Kingsbridge, please tell him our story.'

'Of course,' said the king, but Caris had the feeling he would forget.

The interview seemed to be over, but then William said: 'Your Majesty, now that you have graciously confirmed my elevation to my father's earldom, there is the question of who is to be lord of Caster.'

'Ah, yes. Our son the prince of Wales suggests Sir Ralph Fitzgerald, who was knighted yesterday for saving his life.'

Caris murmured: 'Oh, no!'

The king did not hear her, but William did, and he obviously felt the same way. He was not quite able to hide his indignation as he said: 'Ralph was an outlaw, guilty of numerous thefts, murders, and rapes, until he obtained a royal pardon by joining your majesty's army.'

The king was not as moved by this as Caris expected. He said: 'All the same, Ralph has fought with us for seven years now. He has earned a second chance.'

'Indeed he has,' William said diplomatically. 'But, given the trouble we've had with him in the past, I'd like to see him settle down peacefully for a year of two before he's ennobled.'

'Well, you will be his overlord, so you'll have to deal with him,' Edward granted. 'We won't impose him on you against your will. However, the prince is keen that he should have some further reward.' The king thought for a few moments, then said: 'Don't you have a cousin who is eligible for marriage?'

'Yes, Matilda,' said William. 'We call her Tilly.'

Caris knew Tilly. She was at the nunnery school.

'That's right,' said Edward. 'She was your father Roland's ward. Her father had three villages near Shiring.'

'Your Majesty has a good memory for detail.'

'Marry Lady Matilda to Ralph and give him her father's villages,' said the king.

Caris was appalled. 'But she's only twelve!' she burst out.

William said to her: 'Hush!'

King Edward turned a cold gaze on her. 'The children of the nobility must grow up fast, Sister. Queen Philippa was fourteen when I married her.'

Caris knew she should shut up, but she could not. Tilly was only four years older than the daughter she might have had, if she had given birth to Merthin's baby. 'There's a big difference between twelve and fourteen,' she said desperately.

The young king became even more frosty. 'In the royal presence, people give their opinions only when asked. And the king almost never asks for the opinions of women.'

Caris realized she had taken the wrong tack. Her objection to the marriage was not based on Tilly's age so much as Ralph's character. 'I know Tilly,' she said. 'You can't marry her to that brute Ralph.'

Mair said in a scared whisper: 'Caris! Remember who you're speaking to!'

Edward looked at William. 'Take her away, Shiring, before she says something that cannot be overlooked.'

William took Caris's arm and firmly marched her out of the royal presence. Mair followed. Behind them, Caris heard the king say: 'I can see how she survived in Normandy - the locals must have been terrified of her.' The noblemen around him laughed.

'You must be mad!' William hissed.

'Must I?' Caris said. They were out of earshot of the king now, and she raised her voice. 'In the last six weeks the king has caused the deaths of thousands of men, women, and children, and burned their crops and their homes. And I have tried to save a twelve-year-old girl from being married to a murderer. Tell me again, Lord William, which of us is mad?'
