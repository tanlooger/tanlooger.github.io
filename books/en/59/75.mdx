Sir Gregory Longfellow at last went back to London, but he returned surprisingly quickly, as if he had bounced off the wall of that great city like a football. He showed up at Tench Hall at suppertime looking harassed, breathing hard through his flared nostrils, his long gray hair matted with perspiration. He walked in with something less than his usual air of being in command of all men and beasts that crossed his path. Ralph and Alan were standing by a window, looking at a new broad-bladed style of dagger called a basilard. Without speaking, Gregory threw his tall figure into Ralph's big carved chair: whatever might have happened, he was still too grand to wait for an invitation to sit.

Ralph and Alan stared at him expectantly. Ralph's mother sniffed censoriously: she disliked bad manners.

Finally Gregory said: 'The king does not like to be disobeyed.'

That scared Ralph.

He looked anxiously at Gregory, and asked himself what he had done that could possibly be interpreted as disobedient by the king. He could think of nothing. Nervously he said: 'I'm sorry His Majesty is displeased - I hope it's not with me.'

'You're involved,' Gregory said with annoying vagueness. 'And so am I. The king feels that when his wishes are frustrated it sets a bad precedent.'

'I quite agree.'

'That is why you and I are going to leave here tomorrow, ride to Earlscastle, see the lady Philippa, and make her marry you.'

So that was it. Ralph was mainly relieved. He could not be held responsible for Philippa's recalcitrance, in all fairness - not that fairness made much difference to kings. But, reading between the lines, he guessed that the person taking the blame was Gregory, and so Gregory was now determined to rescue the king's plan and redeem himself.

There was fury and malice in Gregory's expression. He said: 'By the time I have finished with her, I promise you, she will beg you to marry her.'

Ralph could not imagine how this was to be achieved. As Philippa herself had pointed out, you could lead a woman up the aisle but you could not force her to say 'I do.' He said to Gregory: 'Someone told me that a widow's right to refuse marriage is actually guaranteed by Magna Carta.'

Gregory gave him a malevolent look. 'Don't remind me. I made the mistake of mentioning that to His Majesty.'

Ralph wondered, in that case, what threats or promises Gregory planned to use to bend Philippa to his will. Himself, he could think of no way to marry her short of abducting her by force, and carrying her off to some isolated church where a generously bribed priest would turn a deaf ear to her cries of 'No, never!'

They set off early next morning with a small entourage. It was harvest time and, in the North Field, the men were reaping tall stalks of rye while the women followed behind, binding the sheaves.

Lately Ralph had spent more time worrying about the harvest than about Philippa. This was not because of the weather, which was fine, but the plague. He had too few tenants and almost no laborers. Many had been stolen from him by unscrupulous landlords such as Prioress Caris, who seduced other lords' men by offering high wages and attractive tenancies. In desperation, Ralph had given some of his serfs free tenancies, which meant they had no obligation to work on his land - an arrangement that left Ralph denuded of labor at harvesttime. In consequence, it was likely that some of his crops would rot in the fields.

However, he felt his troubles would be over if he could marry Philippa. He would have ten times the land he now controlled, plus income from a dozen other sources, including courts, forests, markets, and mills. And his family would be restored to its rightful place in the nobility. Sir Gerald would be the father of an earl before he died.

He wondered again what Gregory had in mind. Philippa had set herself a challenging task, in defying the formidable will and powerful connections of Gregory. Ralph would not have wished to be standing in her beaded silk shoes.

They arrived at Earlscastle shortly before noon. The sound of the rooks quarreling on the battlements always reminded Ralph of the time he had spent here as a squire in the service of Earl Roland - the happiest days of his life, he sometimes thought. But the place was very quiet now, without an earl. There were no squires playing violent games in the lower compound, no warhorses snorting and stamping as they were groomed and exercised outside the stables, no men-at-arms throwing dice on the steps of the keep.

Philippa was in the old-fashioned hall with Odila and a handful of female attendants. Mother and daughter were working on a tapestry together, sitting side by side on a bench in front of the loom. The picture looked as if it would show a forest scene when finished. Philippa was weaving brown thread for the tree trunks and Odila bright green for the leaves.

'Very nice, but it needs more life,' Ralph said, making his voice cheerful and friendly. 'A few birds and rabbits, and maybe some dogs chasing a deer.'

Philippa was as immune to his charm as ever. She stood up and stepped back, away from him. The girl did the same. Ralph noticed that mother and daughter were equal in height. Philippa said: 'Why have you come here?'

Have it your way, Ralph thought resentfully. He half-turned away from her. 'Sir Gregory here has something to say to you,' he said, and he went to a window and looked out, as if bored.

Gregory greeted the two women formally, and said he hoped he was not intruding on them. It was rubbish - he did not give a hoot for their privacy - but the courtesy seemed to mollify Philippa, who invited him to sit down. Then he said: 'The king is annoyed with you, Countess.'

Philippa bowed her head. 'I am very sorry indeed to have displeased His Majesty.'

'He wishes to reward his loyal servant, Sir Ralph, by making him earl of Shiring. At the same time, he will be providing a young, vigorous husband for you, and a good stepfather for your daughter.' Philippa shuddered, but Gregory ignored that. 'He is mystified by your stubborn defiance.'

Philippa looked scared, as well she might. Things would have been different if she had had a brother or an uncle to stick up for her, but the plague had wiped out her family. As a woman without male relations, she had no one to defend her from the king's wrath. 'What will he do?' she said apprehensively.

'He has not mentioned the word 'treason'...yet.'

Ralph was not sure Philippa could legally be accused of treason, but all the same the threat caused her to turn pale.

Gregory went on: 'He has asked me, in the first instance, to reason with you.'

Philippa said: 'Of course, the king sees marriage as a political matter - '

'It is political,' Gregory interrupted. 'If your beautiful daughter, here, were to fancy herself in love with the charming son of a scullery maid, you would say to her, as I say to you, that noblewomen may not marry whomever they fancy; and you would lock her in her room and have the boy flogged outside her window until he renounced her forever.'

Philippa looked affronted. She did not like being lectured on the duties of her station by a mere lawyer. 'I understand the obligations of an aristocratic widow,' she said haughtily. 'I am a countess, my grandmother was a countess, and my sister was a countess until she died of the plague. But marriage is not just politics. It is also a matter of the heart. We women throw ourselves on the mercy of the men who are our lords and masters, and who have the duty of wisely deciding our fate; and we beg that what we feel in our hearts be not entirely ignored. Such pleas are usually heard.'

She was upset, Ralph could see, but still in control, still full of contempt. That word 'wisely' had a sarcastic sting.

'In normal times, perhaps you would be right, but these are strange days,' Gregory replied. 'Usually, when the king looks around him for someone worthy of an earldom, he sees a dozen wise, strong, vigorous men, loyal to him and keen to serve him in any way they can, any of whom he could appoint to the title with confidence. But now that so many of the best men have been struck down by the plague, the king is like a housewife who goes to the fishmonger at the end of the afternoon - forced to take whatever is left on the slab.'

Ralph saw the force of the argument, but also felt insulted. However, he pretended not to notice.

Philippa changed her tack. She waved a servant over and said: 'Bring us a jug of the best Gascon wine, please. And Sir Gregory will be having dinner here, so let's have some of this season's lamb, cooked with garlic and rosemary.'

'Yes, my lady.'

Gregory said: 'You're most kind, Countess.'

Philippa was incapable of coquetry. To pretend that she was simply being hospitable, with no ulterior motive, was beyond her. She returned straight to the subject. 'Sir Gregory, I have to tell you that my heart, my soul, and my entire being revolt against the prospect of marrying Sir Ralph Fitzgerald.'

'But why?' said Gregory. 'He's a man like any other.'

'No, he's not,' she said.

They were speaking about Ralph as if he were not there, in a way that he found deeply offensive. But Philippa was desperate, and would say anything; and he was curious to know just what it was about him that she disliked so much.

She paused, collecting her thoughts. 'If I say rapist, torturer, murderer...the words just seem too abstract.'

Ralph was taken aback. He did not think of himself that way. Of course, he had tortured people in the king's service, and he had raped Annet, and he had murdered several men, women, and children in his days as an outlaw...At least, he consoled himself, Philippa did not appear to have guessed that he was the hooded figure who had killed Tilly, his own wife.

Philippa went on: 'Human beings have within them something that prevents them from doing such things. It is the ability...no, the compulsion to feel another's pain. We can't help it. You, Sir Gregory, could not rape a woman, because you would feel her grief and agony, you would suffer with her, and this would compel you to relent. You could not torture or murder for the same reason. One who lacks the faculty to feel another's pain is not a man, even though he may walk on two legs and speak English.' She leaned forward, lowering her voice, but even so Ralph heard her clearly. 'And I will not lie in bed with an animal.'

Ralph burst out: 'I am not an animal!'

He expected Gregory to back him up. Instead, Gregory seemed to give in. 'Is that your final word, Lady Philippa?'

Ralph was astonished. Was Gregory going to let that pass, as if it might be even half-true?

Philippa said to Gregory: 'I need you to go back to the king and tell him that I am his loyal and obedient subject, and that I long to win his favor, but that I could not marry Ralph if the Archangel Gabriel commanded me.'

'I see.' Gregory stood up. 'We will not stay to dinner.'

Was that all? Ralph had been waiting for Gregory to produce his surprise, a secret weapon, some irresistible bribe or threat. Did the clever court lawyer really have nothing up his costly brocade sleeve?

Philippa seemed equally startled to find the argument so suddenly terminated.

Gregory went to the door, and Ralph had no choice but to follow. Philippa and Odila stared at the two of them, unsure what to make of this cool walkout. The ladies-in-waiting fell silent.

Philippa said: 'Please, beg the king to be merciful.'

'He will be, my lady,' said Gregory. 'He has authorized me to tell you that, in the light of your obstinacy, he will not force you to marry a man you loathe.'

'Thank you!' she said. 'You have saved my life.'

Ralph opened his mouth to protest. He had been promised! He had committed sacrilege and murder for this reward. Surely it could not be taken from him now?

But Gregory spoke first. 'Instead,' he said, 'it is the king's command that Ralph will marry your daughter.' He paused, and pointed at the tall fifteen-year-old girl standing beside her mother. 'Odila,' he said, as if there were any need to emphasize who he was talking about.

Philippa gasped and Odila screamed.

Gregory bowed. 'Good day to you both.'

Philippa cried: 'Wait!'

Gregory took no notice, and went out.

Stunned, Ralph followed.





Gwenda was weary when she woke up. It was harvesttime, and she was spending every hour of the long August days in the fields. Wulfric would swing the scythe tirelessly from sunrise to nightfall, mowing down the corn. Gwenda's job was to bundle the sheaves. All day long she bent down and scooped up the mown stalks, bent and scooped, bent and scooped until her back seemed to burn with pain. When it was too dark to see, she staggered home and fell into bed, leaving the family to feed themselves with whatever they could find in the cupboard.

Wulfric woke at dawn, and his movements penetrated Gwenda's deep slumber. She struggled to her feet. They all needed a good breakfast, and she put cold mutton, bread, butter, and strong beer on the table. Sam, the ten-year-old, got up, but Davy, who was only eight, had to be shaken awake and pulled to his feet.

'This holding was never farmed by one man and his wife,' Gwenda said grumpily as they ate.

Wulfric was irritatingly positive. 'You and I got the harvest in on our own, the year the bridge collapsed,' he said cheerfully.

'I was twelve years younger then.'

'But you're more beautiful now.'

She was in no mood for gallantry. 'Even when your father and brother were alive, you took on hired labor at harvest time.'

'Never mind. It's our land, and we planted the crops, so we'll benefit from the harvest, instead of earning just a penny a day wages. The more we work, the more we get. That's what you always wanted, isn't it?'

'I always wanted to be independent and self-sufficient, if that's what you mean.' She went to the door. 'A west wind, and a few clouds in the sky.'

Wulfric looked worried. 'We need the rain to hold off for another two or three days.'

'I think it will. Come on, boys, time to go to the field. You can eat walking along.' She was bundling the bread and meat into a sack for their dinner when Nate Reeve hobbled in through the door. 'Oh, no!' she said. 'Not today - we've almost got our harvest in!'

'The lord has a harvest to get in, too,' said the bailiff.

Nate was followed in by his ten-year-old son, Jonathan, known as Jonno, who immediately started making faces at Sam.

Gwenda said: 'Give us three more days on our own land.'

'Don't bother to dispute with me about this,' Nate said. 'You owe the lord one day a week, and two days at harvesttime. Today and tomorrow you will reap his barley in Brookfield.'

'The second day is normally forgiven. That's been the practise for a long time.'

'It was, in times of plentiful labor. The lord is desperate now. So many people have negotiated free tenancies that he has hardly anyone to bring in his harvest.'

'So those who negotiated with you, and demanded to be freed of their customary duties, are rewarded, while people like us, who accepted the old terms, are punished with twice as much work on the lord's land.' She looked accusingly at Wulfric, remembering how he had ignored her when she told him to argue terms with Nate.

'Something like that,' Nate said carelessly.

'Hell,' Gwenda said.

'Don't curse,' said Nate. 'You'll get a free dinner. There will be wheat bread, and a new barrel of ale. Isn't that something to look forward to?'

'Sir Ralph feeds oats to the horses he means to ride hard.'

'Don't be long, now!' Nate went out.

His son, Jonno, poked out his tongue at Sam. Sam made a grab for him, but Jonno slipped out of his grasp and ran after his father.

Wearily, Gwenda and her family trudged across the fields to where Ralph's barley stood waving in the breeze. They got down to work. Wulfric reaped and Gwenda bundled. Sam followed behind, picking up the stray stalks she missed, gathering them until he had enough for a sheaf, then passing them to her to be tied. David had small, nimble fingers, and he plaited straws into tough cords for tying the sheaves. Those other families still working under old-style tenancies labored alongside them, while the cleverer serfs reaped their own crops.

When the sun was at its highest, Nate drove up in a cart with a barrel on the back. True to his word, he provided each family with a big loaf of delicious new wheat bread. Everyone ate their fill, then the adults lay down in the shade to rest while the children played.

Gwenda was dozing off when she heard an outbreak of childish screaming. She knew immediately, from the voice, that neither of her boys was making the noise, but all the same she leaped to her feet. She saw her son Sam fighting with Jonno Reeve. Although they were roughly the same age and size, Sam had Jonno on the ground and was punching and kicking him mercilessly. Gwenda moved toward the boys, but Wulfric was quicker, and he grabbed Sam with one hand and hauled him off.

Gwenda looked at Jonno in dismay. The boy was bleeding from his nose and mouth, and his face around one eye was inflamed and already beginning to swell. He was holding his stomach, moaning and crying. Gwenda had seen plenty of scraps between boys, but this was different. Jonno had been beaten up.

Gwenda stared at her ten-year-old son. His face was unmarked: it looked as if Jonno had not landed a single blow. Sam showed no sign of remorse at what he had done. Rather, he looked smugly triumphant. It was a vaguely familiar expression, and Gwenda searched her memory for its likeness. She did not take long to recall whom she had seen looking like that after giving someone a beating.

She had seen the same expression on the face of Ralph Fitzgerald, Sam's real father.





Two days after Ralph and Gregory visited Earlscastle, Lady Philippa came to Tench Hall.

Ralph had been considering the prospect of marrying Odila. She was a beautiful young girl, but you could buy beautiful young girls for a few pennies in London. Ralph had already had the experience of being married to someone who was little more than a child. After the initial excitement wore off, he had been bored and irritated by her.

He wondered for a while whether he might marry Odila and get Philippa too. The idea of marrying the daughter and keeping the mother as his mistress intrigued him. He might even have them together. He had once had sex with a mother-daughter pair of prostitutes in Calais, and the element of incest had created an exciting sense of depravity.

But, on reflection, he knew that was not going to happen. Philippa would never consent to such an arrangement. He might look for ways to coerce her, but she was not easily bullied. 'I don't want to marry Odila,' he had said to Gregory as they rode home from Earlscastle.

'You won't have to,' Gregory had said, but he refused to elaborate.

Philippa arrived with a lady-in-waiting and a bodyguard but without Odila. As she entered Tench Hall, for once she did not look proud. She did not even look beautiful, Ralph thought: clearly she had not slept for two nights.

They had just sat down to dinner: Ralph, Alan, Gregory, a handful of squires, and a bailiff. Philippa was the only woman in the room.

She walked up to Gregory.

The courtesy he had shown her previously was forgotten. He did not stand, but rudely looked her up and down, as if she were a servant girl with a grievance. 'Well?' he said at last.

'I will marry Ralph.'

'Oh!' he said in mock surprise. 'Will you, now?'

'Yes. Rather than sacrifice my daughter to him, I will marry him myself.'

'My lady,' he said sarcastically, 'you seem to think that the king has led you to a table laden with dishes and asked you to choose which you like best. You are mistaken. The king does not ask what is your pleasure. He commands. You disobeyed one command, so he issued another. He did not give you a choice.'

She looked down. 'I am very sorry for my behavior. Please spare my daughter.'

'If it were up to me, I would decline your request, as punishment for your intransigence. But perhaps you should plead with Sir Ralph.'

She looked at Ralph. He saw rage and despair in her eyes. He felt excited. She was the most haughty woman he had ever met, and he had broken her pride. He wanted to lie with her now, right away.

But it was not yet over.

He said: 'You have something to say to me?'

'I apologize.'

'Come here.' Ralph was sitting at the head of the table, and she approached and stood by him. He caressed the head of a lion carved into the arm of his chair. 'Go on,' he said.

'I am sorry that I spurned you before. I would like to withdraw everything I said. I accept your proposal. I will marry you.'

'But I have not renewed my proposal. The king orders me to marry Odila.'

'If you ask the king to revert to his original plan, surely he will grant your plea.'

'And that is what you are asking me to do.'

'Yes.' She looked him in the eye and swallowed her final humiliation. 'I am asking you...I am begging you. Please, Sir Ralph, make me your wife.'

Ralph stood up, pushing his chair back. 'Kiss me, then.'

She closed her eyes.

He put his left arm around her shoulders and pulled her to him. He kissed her lips. She submitted unresponsively. With his right hand, he squeezed her breast. It was as firm and heavy as he had always imagined. He ran his hand down her body and between her legs. She flinched, but remained unresistingly in his embrace, and he pressed his palm against the fork of her thighs. He grasped her mound, cupping its triangular fatness in his hand.

Then, holding that position, he broke the kiss and looked around the room at his friends.
