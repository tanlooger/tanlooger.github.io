Caris's home was a luxurious wood-frame building with stone floors and a stone chimney. There were three separate rooms on the ground floor: the hall with the big dining table, the small parlor where Papa could discuss business privately, and the kitchen at the back. When Caris and Gwenda walked in, the house was full of the mouthwatering smell of a ham boiling.

Caris led Gwenda through the hall and up the internal staircase.

'Where are the puppies?' said Gwenda.

'I want to see my mother first,' Caris replied. 'She's ill.'

They went into the front bedroom, where Mama lay on the carved wooden bedstead. She was small and frail: Caris was already the same height. Mama looked paler than usual, and her hair was not yet dressed, so it stuck to her damp cheeks. 'How are you feeling?' Caris said.

'A little weak, today.' The effort of speaking made Mama breathless.

Caris felt a familiar, painful jumble of anxiety and helplessness. Her mother had been ill for a year. It had started with pains in her joints. Soon she had ulcers inside her mouth and unaccountable bruises on her body. She had felt too weak to do anything. Last week she had caught a cold. Now she was running a fever and had trouble in catching her breath.

'Is there anything you need?' Caris asked.

'No, thank you.'

It was the usual answer, but Caris felt maddened by powerlessness each time she heard it. 'Should I fetch Mother Cecilia?' The prioress of Kingsbridge was the only person able to bring Mama some comfort. She had an extract of poppies that she mixed with honey and warm wine that eased the pain for a while. Caris regarded Cecilia as better than an angel.

'No need, dear,' Mama said. 'How was the All Hallows service?'

Caris noticed how pale her mother's lips were. 'Scary,' she said.

Mama paused, resting, then said: 'What have you been doing this morning?'

'Watching the archery.' Caris held her breath, frightened that Mama might guess her guilty secret, as she often did.

But Mama looked at Gwenda. 'Who is your little friend?'

'Gwenda. I've brought her to see the puppies.'

'That's lovely.' Mama suddenly looked tired. She closed her eyes and turned her head aside.

The girls crept out quietly.

Gwenda was looking shocked. 'What's wrong with her?'

'A wasting disease.' Caris hated to talk about it. Her mother's illness gave her the unnerving feeling that nothing was certain, anything could happen, there was no safety in the world. It was even more frightening than the fight they had witnessed in the forest. If she thought about what might happen, and the possibility that her mother might die, she suffered a panicky fluttering sensation in her chest that made her want to scream.

The middle bedroom was used in summer by the Italians, wool buyers from Florence and Prato who came to do business with Papa. Now it was empty. The puppies were in the back bedroom, which belonged to Caris and her sister, Alice. They were seven weeks old, ready to leave their mother, who was growing impatient with them. Gwenda gave a sigh of joy and immediately got down on the floor with them.

Caris picked up the smallest of the litter, a lively female, always going off on her own to explore the world. 'This is the one I'm going to keep,' she said. 'She's called Scrap.' Holding the little dog soothed her, and helped her forget about the things that troubled her.

The other four clambered all over Gwenda, sniffing her and chewing her dress. She picked up an ugly brown dog with a long muzzle and eyes set too close together. 'I like this one,' she said. The puppy curled up in her lap.

Caris said: 'Would you like to keep him?'

Tears came to Gwenda's eyes. 'Could I?'

'We're allowed to give them away.'

'Really?'

'Papa doesn't want any more dogs. If you like him, you can have him.'

'Oh, yes,' Gwenda said in a whisper. 'Yes, please.'

'What will you name him?'

'Something that reminds me of Hop. Perhaps I'll call him Skip.'

'That's a good name.' Skip had already gone to sleep in Gwenda's lap, Caris saw.

The two girls sat quietly with the dogs. Caris thought about the boys they had met, the little red-haired one with the golden brown eyes and his tall, handsome younger brother. What had made her take them into the forest? It was not the first time she had yielded to a stupid impulse. It tended to happen when someone in authority ordered her not to do something. Her aunt Petranilla was a great rule-maker. 'Don't feed that cat, we'll never get rid of it. No ball games in the house. Stay away from that boy, his family are peasants.' Rules that constrained her behavior seemed to drive Caris crazy.

But she had never done something this foolish. She felt shaky when she thought of it. Two men had died. But what might have happened was worse. The four children might have been killed, too.

She wondered what the fight had been about, and why the men-at-arms had been chasing the knight. Obviously it was not a simple robbery. They had spoken about a letter. But Merthin had said no more about that. Probably he had learned nothing further. It was just another of the mysteries of adult life.

Caris had liked Merthin. His boring brother, Ralph, was just like every other boy in Kingsbridge, boastful and aggressive and stupid, but Merthin seemed different. He had intrigued her right from the start.

Two new friends in one day, she thought, looking at Gwenda. The little girl was not pretty. She had dark brown eyes set close together above a beaky nose. She had picked a dog that looked a bit like her, Caris realized with amusement. Gwenda's clothes were old, and must have been worn by many children before her. Gwenda was calmer now. She no longer looked as if she might burst into tears at any moment. She, too, had been soothed by the puppies.

There was a familiar lopsided tread in the hall below, and a moment later a voice bellowed: 'Bring me a flagon of ale, for the love of the saints, I've got a thirst like a cart horse.'

'It's my father,' Caris said. 'Come and meet him.' Seeing that Gwenda looked anxious, she added: 'Don't worry, he always shouts like that, but he's really nice.'

The girls went downstairs with their puppies. 'What's happened to all my servants?' Papa roared. 'Have they run away to join the fairy folk?' He came stomping out of the kitchen, trailing his twisted right leg as always, carrying a big wooden cup slopping over with ale. 'Hello, my little buttercup,' he said to Caris in a softer voice. He sat on the big chair at the head of the table and took a long draft from the cup. 'That's better,' he said, wiping his straggly beard with his sleeve. He noticed Gwenda. 'A little daisy to go with my buttercup?' he said. 'What's your name?'

'Gwenda, from Wigleigh, my lord,' she said, awestruck.

'I gave her a puppy,' Caris explained.

'That's a good idea!' Papa said. 'Puppies need affection, and no one can love a puppy the way a little girl does.'

On the stool beside the table Caris saw a cloak of scarlet cloth. It had to be imported, for English dyers did not know how to achieve such a bright red. Following her eye, Papa said: 'It's for your mother. She's always wanted a coat of Italian red. I'm hoping it will encourage her to get well enough to wear it.'

Caris touched it. The wool was soft and close-woven, as only the Italians could make it. 'It's beautiful,' she said.

Aunt Petranilla entered from the street. She bore some resemblance to Papa, but was purse-mouthed where he was hearty. She was more like her other brother, Anthony, the prior of Kingsbridge: they were both tall, imposing figures, whereas Papa was short, barrel-chested, and lame.

Caris disliked Petranilla. She was clever as well as mean, a deadly combination in an adult: Caris was never able to outwit her. Gwenda sensed Caris's dislike, and looked apprehensively at the newcomer. Only Papa was pleased to see her. 'Come in, sister,' he said. 'Where are all my servants?'

'I can't think why you imagine I should know that, having just come from my own house at the other end of the street, but if I had to guess, Edmund, I should say that your cook is in the henhouse, hoping to find an egg to make you a pudding, and your maid is upstairs, helping your wife to a close stool, which she generally requires about midday. As for your apprentices, I hope they are both on guard duty at the warehouse by the riverside, making sure that no holiday revelers take it into their drunken heads to light a bonfire within a spark's fly of your wool store.'

She often spoke like this, giving a little sermon in answer to a simple question. Her manner was supercilious, as always, but Papa did not mind, or pretended not to. 'My remarkable sister,' he said. 'You're the one who inherited our father's wisdom.'

Petranilla turned to the girls. 'Our father was descended from Tom Builder, the stepfather and mentor of Jack Builder, architect of Kingsbridge Cathedral,' she said. 'Father vowed to give his firstborn to God but, unfortunately, his firstborn was a girl - me. He named me after Saint Petranilla - who was the daughter of Saint Peter, as I'm sure you know - and he prayed for a boy next time. But his first son was born deformed, and he did not want to give God a flawed gift, so he brought Edmund up to take over the wool business. Happily, his third child was our brother Anthony, a well behaved and God-fearing child, who entered the monastery as a boy and is now, we are all proud to say, the prior.'

She would have become a priest, had she been a man, but as it was she had done the next best thing and brought up her son, Godwyn, to be a monk at the priory. Like Grandfather Wooler, she had given a child to God. Caris had always felt sorry for Godwyn, her older cousin, for having Petranilla as a mother.

Petranilla noticed the red coat. 'Whose is this?' she said. 'It's the most expensive Italian cloth!'

'I bought it for Rose,' said Papa.

Petranilla stared at him for a moment. Caris could tell she thought he was a fool to buy such a coat for a woman who had not left the house for a year. But all she said was: 'You're very good to her,' which might have been a compliment or not.

Father did not care. 'Go up and see her,' he urged. 'You'll cheer her up.'

Caris doubted that, but Petranilla suffered no such misgivings, and she went up the stairs.

Caris's sister, Alice, came in from the street. She was eleven, a year older than Caris. She stared at Gwenda and said: 'Who's she?'

'My new friend Gwenda,' said Caris. 'She's going to take a puppy.'

'But she's got the one I wanted!' Alice protested.

She had not said that before. 'Ooh - you never picked one!' Caris said, outraged. 'You're just saying that to be mean.'

'Why should she have one of our puppies?'

Papa intervened. 'Now, now,' he said. 'We've got more puppies than we need.'

'Caris should have asked me which one I wanted first!'

'Yes, she should,' Papa said, even though he knew perfectly well that Alice was only making trouble. 'Don't do it again, Caris.'

'Yes, Papa.'

The cook came in from the kitchen with jugs and cups. When Caris was learning to talk she had called the cook Tutty, no one knew why, but the name had stuck. Papa said: 'Thank you, Tutty. Sit at the table, girls.' Gwenda hesitated, not sure if she was invited, but Caris nodded at her, knowing that Papa intended her to be included - he generally asked everyone within his range of vision to come to dinner.

Tutty refilled Papa's cup with ale, then gave Alice, Caris, and Gwenda ale mixed with water. Gwenda drank all of hers immediately, with relish, and Caris guessed she did not often get ale: poor people drank cider made from crab apples.

Next, the cook put in front of each of them a thick slice of rye bread a foot square. Gwenda picked hers up to eat it, and Caris realized she had never dined at a table before. 'Wait,' she said quietly, and Gwenda put the bread down again. Tutty brought in the ham on a board and a dish of cabbage. Papa took a big knife and cut slices off the ham, piling it on their bread trenchers. Gwenda stared big-eyed at the quantity of meat she was given. Caris spooned cabbage leaves on top of the ham.

The chambermaid, Elaine, came hurrying down the stairs. 'The mistress seems worse,' she said. 'Mistress Petranilla says we should send for Mother Cecilia.'

'Then run to the priory and beg her to come,' Papa said.

The maid hurried off.

'Eat up, children,' said Papa, and he speared a slice of hot ham with his knife; but Caris could see that the dinner now had no relish for him, and he seemed to be looking at something far away.

Gwenda ate some cabbage and whispered: 'This is food from Heaven.' Caris tried it. The cabbage was cooked with ginger. Gwenda had probably never tasted ginger: only rich people could afford it.

Petranilla came down, put some ham on a wooden platter, and took it up for Mama; but she came back a few moments later with the food untouched. She sat at the table to eat it herself, and the cook brought her a bread trencher. 'When I was a girl, we were the only family in Kingsbridge who had meat for dinner every day,' she said. 'Except on fast days - my father was very devout. He was the first wool merchant in town to deal directly with the Italians. Everyone does now - although my brother Edmund is still the most important.'

Caris had lost her appetite, and she had to chew for a long time before she could swallow. At last Mother Cecilia arrived, a small, vital woman with a reassuringly bossy manner. With her was Sister Juliana, a simple person with a warm heart. Caris felt better as she watched them climb the stairs, a chirpy sparrow with a hen waddling behind. They would wash Mama in rose water to cool her fever, and the fragrance would lift her spirits.

Tutty brought in apples and cheese. Papa peeled an apple absentmindedly with his knife. Caris remembered how, when she was younger, he used to feed her peeled slices then eat the skin himself.

Sister Juliana came downstairs, a worried look on her pudgy face. 'The prioress wants Brother Joseph to come and see Mistress Rose,' she said. Joseph was the senior physician at the monastery: he had trained with the masters at Oxford. 'I'll just go and fetch him,' Juliana said, and she ran out through the door to the street.

Papa put his peeled apple down uneaten.

Caris said: 'What is going to happen?'

'I don't know, buttercup. Will it rain? How many sacks of wool do the Florentines need? Will the sheep catch a murrain? Is the baby a girl, or a boy with a twisted leg? We never know, do we? That's...' He looked away. 'That's what makes it so hard.'

He gave her the apple. Caris gave it to Gwenda, who ate it entire, core and pips, too.

Brother Joseph arrived a few minutes later with a young assistant whom Caris recognized as Saul Whitehead, so called because his hair - what little he had left after his monkish haircut - was ash blond.

Cecilia and Juliana came downstairs, no doubt to make room for the two men in the small bedroom. Cecilia sat at the table, but did not eat. She had a small face with sharp features: a little pointed nose, bright eyes, a chin like the prow of a boat. She looked with curiosity at Gwenda. 'Well, now,' she said brightly, 'who is this little girl, and does she love Jesus and His Holy Mother?'

Gwenda said: 'I'm Gwenda, I'm Caris's friend.' She looked anxiously at Caris, as if she feared it might have been presumptuous of her to claim friendship.

Caris said: 'Will the Virgin Mary make my mama better?'

Cecilia raised her eyebrows. 'Such a direct question. I could have guessed you're Edmund's daughter.'

'Everyone prays to her, but not everyone gets well,' Caris said.

'And do you know why that is?'

'Perhaps she never helps anyone, and it's just that the strong people get well and the weak don't.'

'Now, now, don't be silly,' said Papa. 'Everyone knows the Holy Mother helps us.'

'That's all right,' Cecilia told him. 'It's normal for children to ask questions - especially the bright ones. Caris, the saints are always powerful, but some prayers are more effective than others. Do you understand that?'

Caris nodded reluctantly, feeling not convinced so much as outwitted.

'She must come to our school,' Cecilia said. The nuns had a school for the daughters of the nobility and of the more prosperous townspeople. The monks ran a separate school for boys.

Papa looked stubborn. 'Rose has taught both girls their letters,' he said. 'And Caris knows her numbers as well as I do - she helps me in the business.'

'She should learn more than that. Surely you don't want her to spend her life as your servant?'

Petranilla put in: 'She has no need of book learning. She will marry extremely well. There will be crowds of suitors for both sisters. Sons of merchants, even sons of knights will be eager to marry into this family. But Caris is a willful child: we must take care she doesn't throw herself away on some penniless minstrel boy.'

Caris noticed that Petranilla did not anticipate trouble with obedient Alice, who would probably marry whomever they picked for her.

Cecilia said: 'God might call Caris to his service.'

Papa said grumpily: 'God has already called two from this family - my brother and my nephew. I'd have thought He would be satisfied by now.'

Cecilia looked at Caris. 'What do you think?' she said. 'Will you be a wool merchant, a knight's wife, or a nun?'

The idea of being a nun horrified Caris. She would have to obey someone else's orders every hour of the day. It would be like remaining a child all your life, and having Petranilla for a mother. Being the wife of a knight, or of anyone else, seemed almost as bad, for women had to obey their husbands. Helping Papa, then perhaps taking over the business when he was too old, was the least unattractive option, but on the other hand it was not exactly her dream. 'I don't want to be any of those,' she said.

'Is there something you would like?' Cecilia asked.

There was, although Caris had not told anyone before, in fact had not fully realized it until now; but the ambition seemed fully formed, and suddenly she knew without doubt that it was her destiny. 'I'm going to be a doctor,' she said.

There was a moment of silence, then they all laughed.

Caris flushed, not knowing what was so funny.

Papa took pity and said: 'Only men can be doctors. Didn't you know that, buttercup?'

Caris was bewildered. She turned to Cecilia. 'But what about you?'

'I'm not a physician,' Cecilia said. 'We nuns care for the sick, of course, but we follow the instructions of trained men. The monks who have studied under the masters understand the humors of the body, the way they go out of balance in sickness, and how to bring them back to their correct proportions for good health. They know which vein to bleed for migraine, leprosy, or breathlessness; where to cup and cauterize; whether to poultice or bathe.'

'Couldn't a woman learn those things?'

'Perhaps, but God has ordained it otherwise.'

Caris felt frustrated with the way adults trotted out this truism every time they were stuck for an answer. Before she could say anything, Brother Saul came downstairs with a bowl of blood and went through the kitchen to the backyard to get rid of it. The sight made Caris feel weepy. All doctors used bloodletting as a cure, so it must be effective, she supposed; but all the same she hated to see her mother's life force in a bowl to be thrown away.

Saul returned to the sick room, and a few moments later he and Joseph came down. 'I've done what I can for her,' Joseph said solemnly to Papa. 'And she has confessed her sins.'

Confessed her sins! Caris knew what that meant. She began to cry.

Papa took six silver pennies from his purse and gave them to the monk. 'Thank you, Brother,' he said. His voice was hoarse.

As the monks left, the two nuns went back upstairs.

Alice sat on Papa's lap and buried her face in his neck. Caris cried and hugged Scrap. Petranilla ordered Tutty to clear the table. Gwenda watched everything with wide eyes. They sat around the table in silence, waiting.
