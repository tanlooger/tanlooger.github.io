Merthin's orchard had been planted in the spring of 1349. A year later most of the trees were established and came out in a scatter of brave leaves. Two or three were struggling, and only one was inarguably dead. He did not expect any of them to bear fruit yet, but by July, to his surprise, one precocious sapling had a dozen or so tiny dark green pears, small as yet and as hard as stones, but promising ripeness in the autumn.

One Sunday afternoon he showed them to Lolla, who refused to believe that they would grow into the tangy, juicy fruits she loved. She thought - or pretended to think - that he was playing one of his teasing games. When he asked her where she imagined ripe pears came from, she looked at him reproachfully and said: 'The market, silly!'

She, too, would ripen one day, he thought, although it was hard to imagine her bony body rounding out into the soft shape of a woman. He wondered whether she would bear him grandchildren. She was five years old, so that day might be only a decade or so away.

His thoughts were on ripeness when he saw Philippa coming toward him through the garden, and it struck him how round and full her breasts were. It was unusual for her to visit him in daylight, and he wondered what had brought her here. In case they were observed, he greeted her with only a chaste kiss on the cheek, such as a brother-in-law might give without arousing comment.

She looked troubled, and he realized that for a few days now she had been more reserved and thoughtful than usual. As she sat beside him on the grass he said: 'Something on your mind?'

'I've never been good at breaking news gently,' she said. 'I'm pregnant.'

'Good God!' He was too shocked to hold back his reaction. 'I'm surprised because you told me...'

'I know. I was sure I was too old. For a couple of years my monthly cycle was irregular, and then it stopped altogether - I thought. But I've been vomiting in the morning, and my nipples hurt.'

'I noticed your breasts as you came into the garden. But can you be sure?'

'I've been pregnant six times previously - three children and three miscarriages - and I know the feeling. There's really no doubt.'

He smiled. 'Well, we're going to have a child.'

She did not return the smile. 'Don't look pleased. You haven't thought through the implications. I'm the wife of the earl of Shiring. I haven't slept with him since October, haven't lived with him since February, yet in July I'm two or at most three months pregnant. He and the whole world will know that the baby is not his, and that the countess of Shiring has committed adultery.'

'But he wouldn't...'

'Kill me? He killed Tilly, didn't he?'

'Oh, my God. Yes, he did. But...'

'And if he killed me, he might kill my baby, too.'

Merthin wanted to say it was not possible, that Ralph would not do such a thing - but he knew otherwise.

'I have to decide what to do,' said Philippa.

'I don't think you should try to end the pregnancy with potions - it's too dangerous.'

'I won't do that.'

'So you'll have the baby.'

'Yes. But then what?'

'Suppose you stayed in the nunnery, and kept the baby secret? The place is full of children orphaned by the plague.'

'But what couldn't be kept secret is a mother's love. Everyone would know that the child was my particular care. And then Ralph would find out.'

'You're right.'

'I could go away - vanish. London, York, Paris, Avignon. Not tell anyone where I was going, so that Ralph could never come after me.'

'And I could go with you.'

'But then you wouldn't finish your tower.'

'And you would miss Odila.'

Philippa's daughter had been married to Earl David for six months. Merthin could imagine how hard it would be for Philippa to leave her. And the truth was that he would find it agony to abandon his tower. All his adult life he had wanted to build the tallest building in England. Now that he had at last begun, it would break his heart to abandon the project.

Thinking of the tower brought Caris to mind. He knew, intuitively, that she would be devastated by this news. He had not seen her for weeks: she had been ill in bed after suffering a blow on the head at the Fleece Fair, and now, though she was completely recovered, she rarely emerged from the priory. He guessed that she had lost some kind of power struggle, for the hospital was being run by Brother Sime. Philippa's pregnancy would be another shattering blow for Caris.

Philippa added: 'And Odila, too, is pregnant.'

'So soon! That's good news. But even more reason why you can't go into exile and never see her, or your grandchild.'

'I can't run, and I can't hide. But, if I do nothing, Ralph will kill me.'

'There must be a way out of this,' Merthin said.

'I can think of only one answer.'

He looked at her. She had thought this out already, he realized. She had not told him about the problem until she had the solution. But she had been careful to show him that all the obvious answers were wrong. That meant he was not going to like the plan she had settled on.

'Tell me,' he said.

'We have to make Ralph think the baby is his.'

'But then you'd have to...'

'Yes.'

'I see.'

The thought of Philippa sleeping with Ralph was loathsome to Merthin. This was not so much jealousy, though that was a factor. What weighed most with him was how terrible she would feel about it. She had a physical and emotional revulsion toward Ralph. Merthin understood the revulsion, though he did not share it. He had lived with Ralph's brutishness all his life, and the brute was his brother, and somehow that fact remained no matter what Ralph did. All the same, it made him sick to think that Philippa would have to force herself to have sex with the man she hated most in the world.

'I wish I could think of a better way,' he said.

'So do I.'

He looked hard at her. 'You've already decided.'

'Yes.'

'I'm very sorry.'

'So am I.'

'But will it even work? Can you...seduce him?'

'I don't know,' she said. 'I'll just have to try.'





The cathedral was symmetrical. The mason's loft was at the west end in the low north tower, overlooking the north porch. In the matching southwest tower was a room of similar size and shape that looked over the cloisters. It was used to store items of small value that were used only rarely. All the costumes and symbolic objects employed in the mystery plays were there, together with an assortment of not-quite-useless things: wooden candlesticks, rusty chains, cracked pots, and a book whose vellum pages had rotted with age so that the words penned so painstakingly were no longer legible.

Merthin went there to check how upright the wall was, by dangling a lead pointer on a long string from the window; and while there he made a discovery.

There were cracks in the wall. Cracks were not necessarily a sign of weakness: their meaning had to be interpreted by an experienced eye. All buildings moved, and cracks might simply show how a structure was adjusting to accommodate change. Merthin judged that most of the cracks in the wall of this storeroom were benign. But there was one that puzzled him by its shape. It did not look normal. A second glance told him that someone had taken advantage of a natural crack to loosen a small stone. He removed the stone.

He realized immediately that he had found someone's secret hiding place. The space behind the stone was a thief's stash. He took the objects out one by one. There was a woman's brooch with a large green stone; a silver buckle; a silk shawl; and a scroll with a psalm written on it. Right at the back he found the object that gave him the clue to the identity of the thief. It was the only thing in the hole that had no monetary value. A simple piece of polished wood, it had letters carved into its surface that read: 'M:Phmn:AMAT.'

M was just an initial. Amat was the Latin for 'loves.' And Phmnn was surely Philemon.

Someone whose name began with M, boy or girl, had once loved Philemon and given him this; and he had hidden it with his stolen treasures.

Since childhood Philemon had been rumored to be light-fingered. Around him, things went missing. It seemed that this was where he hid them. Merthin imagined him coming up here alone, perhaps at night, to pull out the stone and gloat over his loot. No doubt it was a kind of sickness.

There had never been any rumors about Philemon having lovers. Like his mentor Godwyn, he seemed to be one of that small minority of men in whom the need for sexual love was weak. But someone had fallen for him, at some time, and he cherished the memory.

Merthin replaced the objects, putting them back exactly the way he had found them - he had a good memory for that sort of thing. He replaced the loose stone. Then, thoughtfully, he left the room and went back down the spiral staircase.





Ralph was surprised when Philippa came home.

It was a rare fine day in a wet summer, and he would have liked to be out hawking, but to his anger he was not able to go. The harvest was about to begin, and most of the twenty or thirty stewards, bailiffs, and reeves in the earldom needed to see him urgently. They all had the same problem: crops ripening in the fields and insufficient men and woman to harvest them.

He could do nothing to help. He had taken every opportunity to prosecute laborers who defied the ordinance by leaving their villages in search of higher wages - but those few who could be caught just paid the fine out of their earnings and ran off again. So his bailiffs had to make do. However, they all wanted to explain their difficulties to him, and he had no choice but to listen and give his approval to their makeshift plans.

The hall was full of people: bailiffs, knights and men-at-arms, a couple of priests, and a dozen or more loitering servants. When they all went quiet, Ralph suddenly heard the rooks outside, their harsh call sounding like a warning. He looked up and saw Philippa in the doorway.

She spoke first to the servants. 'Martha! This table is still dirty from dinner. Fetch hot water and scrub it, now. Dickie - I've just seen the earl's favorite courser covered with what looks like yesterday's mud, and you're here whittling a stick. Get back to the stables where you belong and clean up that horse. You, boy, put that puppy outside, it's just pissed on the floor. The only dog allowed in the hall is the earl's mastiff, you know that.' The servants were galvanized into action, even those to whom she had not spoken suddenly finding work to do.

Ralph did not mind Philippa issuing orders to the domestic servants. They got lazy without a mistress to harry them.

She came up to him and made a deep curtsy, as was only appropriate after a long absence. She did not offer to kiss him.

He said neutrally: 'This is...unexpected.'

Philippa said irritably: 'I shouldn't have had to make the journey at all.'

Ralph groaned inwardly. 'What brings you here?' he said. Whatever it was, there would be trouble, he felt sure.

'My manor of Ingsby.'

Philippa had a small number of properties of her own, a few villages in Gloucestershire that paid tribute to her rather than to the earl. Since she had gone to live at the nunnery, the bailiffs from these villages had been visiting her at Kingsbridge Priory, Ralph knew, and accounting to her directly for their dues. But Ingsby was an awkward exception. The manor paid tribute to him and he passed it on to her - which he had forgotten to do since she left. 'Damn,' he said. 'It slipped my mind.'

'That's all right,' she said. 'You've got a lot to think about.'

That was surprisingly conciliatory.

She went upstairs to the private chamber, and he returned to his work. Half a year of separation had improved her a little, he thought as another bailiff enumerated the fields of ripening corn and bemoaned the shortage of reapers. Still, he hoped she did not plan to stay long. Lying beside her at night was like sleeping with a dead cow.

She reappeared at suppertime. She sat next to Ralph and spoke politely to several visiting knights during the meal. She was as cool and reserved as ever - there was no affection, not even any humor - but he saw no sign of the implacable, icy hatred she had shown after their wedding. It was gone, or at least deeply hidden. When the meal was over, she retired again, leaving him to drink with the knights.

He considered the possibility that she was planning to come back permanently, but in the end he dismissed the idea. She would never love him or even like him. It was just that a long absence had blunted the edge of her resentment. The underlying feeling would probably never leave her.

He assumed she would be asleep when he went upstairs but, to his surprise, she was at the writing desk, in an ivory-colored linen nightgown, a single candle throwing a soft light over her proud features and thick dark hair. In front of her was a long letter in a girlish hand, which he guessed was from Odila, now the countess of Monmouth. Philippa was penning a reply. Like most aristocrats, she dictated business letters to a clerk, but wrote personal ones herself.

He stepped into the garderobe, then came out and took off his outer clothing. It was summer, and he normally slept in his underdrawers.

Philippa finished her letter, stood up - and knocked over the jar of ink on the desk. She jumped back, too late. Somehow it fell toward her, disfiguring her white nightdress with a broad black stain. She cursed. He was mildly amused: she was so prissily particular that it was funny to see her splashed with ink.

She hesitated for a moment, then pulled the nightdress off over her head.

He was startled. She was not normally quick to take off her clothes. She had been disconcerted by the ink, he realized. He stared at her naked body. She had put on a little weight at the nunnery: her breasts seemed larger and rounder than before, her belly had a slight but discernible bulge, and her hips had an attractive swelling curve. To his surprise, he felt aroused.

She bent down to mop the ink off the tiled floor with her bundled-up nightgown. Her breasts swayed as she rubbed the tiles. She turned, and he got a full view of her generous behind. If he had not known her better, he would have suspected her of trying to inflame him. But Philippa had never tried to inflame anyone, let alone him. She was just awkward and embarrassed. And that made it even more stimulating to stare at her exposed nakedness while she wiped the floor.

It was several weeks since he had been with a woman, and the last one had been a very unsatisfactory whore in Salisbury.

By the time Philippa stood up, he had an erection.

She saw him staring. 'Don't look at me,' she said. 'Go to bed.' She threw the soiled garment into the laundry hamper.

She went to the clothespress and lifted its lid. She had left most of her clothes here when she went to Kingsbridge: it was not considered seemly to dress richly when living in a nunnery, even for noble guests. She found another nightdress. Ralph raked her with his eyes as she lifted it out. He stared at her uplifted breasts, and the mound of her sex with its dark hair, and his mouth went dry.

She caught his look. 'Don't you touch me,' she said.

If she had not said that, he would probably have lain down and gone to sleep. But her swift rejection stung him. 'I'm the earl of Shiring and you're my wife,' he said. 'I'll touch you anytime I like.'

'You wouldn't dare,' she said, and she turned away to put on the gown.

That angered him. As she lifted the garment to put it on over her head, he slapped her bottom. It was a hard slap on bare skin, and he could tell that it hurt her. She jumped and cried out. 'So much for not daring,' he said. She turned to him, a protest on her lips, and on impulse he punched her in the mouth. She was knocked back and fell to the floor. Her hands flew to her mouth, and blood seeped through her fingers. But she was on her back, naked, with her legs spread, and he could see the triangle of hair at the fork of her thighs, with its cleft slightly parted in what looked like an invitation.

He fell on her.

She wriggled furiously, but he was bigger than she, and strong. He overcame her resistance effortlessly. A moment later he was inside her. She was dry, but somehow that excited him.

It was all over quite quickly. He rolled off her, panting. After a few moments he looked at her. There was blood on her mouth. She did not look back at him: her eyes were closed. Yet it seemed to him that there was a curious expression on her face. He thought about it for a while until he worked it out; then he was even more puzzled than before.

She looked triumphant.





Merthin knew that Philippa had returned to Kingsbridge, because he saw her maid in the Bell. He expected his lover to come to his house that night, and was disappointed when she did not. No doubt she felt awkward, he thought. No lady would be comfortable with what she had done, even though the reasons were compelling, even though the man she loved knew and understood.

Another night went by without her appearing, then it was Sunday and he felt sure he would see her in church. But she did not come to the service. It was almost unheard of for the nobility to miss Sunday mass. What had kept her away?

After the service he sent Lolla home with Arn and Em, then went across the green to the old hospital. On the upper floor were three rooms for important guests. He took the outside staircase.

In the corridor he came face-to-face with Caris.

She did not bother to ask what he was doing here. 'The countess doesn't want you to see her, but you probably should,' she said.

Merthin noted the odd turn of phrase: Not 'The countess doesn't want to see you,' but 'The countess doesn't want you to see her.' He looked at the bowl Caris was carrying. It contained a bloodstained rag. Fear struck his heart. 'What's wrong?'

'Nothing too serious,' Caris said. 'The baby is unharmed.'

'Thank God.'

'You're the father, of course?'

'Please don't ever let anyone hear you say that.'

She looked sad. 'All the years you and I were together, and I only conceived that one time.'

He looked away. 'Which room is she in?'

'Sorry to talk about myself. I'm the last thing you're interested in. Lady Philippa is in the middle room.'

He caught the poorly suppressed grief in her voice and paused, despite his anxiety for Philippa. He touched Caris's arm. 'Please don't believe I'm not interested in you,' he said. 'I'll always care what happens to you, and whether you're happy.'

She nodded, and tears came to her eyes. 'I know,' she said. 'I'm being selfish. Go and see Philippa.'

He left Caris and entered the middle room. Philippa was kneeling on the prie-dieu with her back to him. He interrupted her prayers. 'Are you all right?'

She stood up and turned to him. Her face was a mess. Her lips were swollen to three times their normal size and badly scabbed.

He guessed that Caris had been bathing the wound - hence the bloody rag. 'What happened?' he said. 'Can you speak?'

She nodded. 'I sound queer, but I can talk.' Her voice was a mumble, but comprehensible.

'How badly are you hurt?'

'My face looks awful, but it's not serious. Other than that, I'm fine.'

He put his arms around her. She laid her head on his shoulder. He waited, holding her. After a while, she began to cry. He stroked her hair and her back while she shook with sobs. He said: 'There, there,' and kissed her forehead, but he did not try to silence her.

Slowly, her weeping subsided.

He said: 'Can I kiss your lips?'

She nodded. 'Gently.'

He brushed them with his own. He tasted almonds: Caris had smeared the cuts with oil. 'Tell me what happened,' he said.

'It worked. He was fooled. He will be sure it's his baby.'

He touched her mouth with his fingertip. 'And he did this?'

'Don't be angry. I tried to provoke him, and I succeeded. Be glad he hit me.'

'Glad! Why?'

'Because he thinks he had to force me. He believes I would not have submitted without violence. He has no inkling that I intended to seduce him. He will never suspect the truth. Which means I'm safe - and so is our baby.'

He put his hand on her belly. 'But why didn't you come and see me?'

'Looking like this?'

'I want to be with you even more when you're hurt.' He moved his hand to her breast. 'Besides, I've missed you.'

She took his hand away. 'I can't go from one to the other like a whore.'

'Oh.' He had not thought of it that way.

'Do you understand?'

'I think so.' He could see that a woman would feel cheap - although a man might be proud of doing exactly the same thing. 'But how long...?'

She sighed, and moved away. 'It's not how long.'

'What do you mean?'

'We've agreed to tell the world that this is Ralph's baby, and I've made sure he'll believe that. Now he's going to want to raise it.'

Merthin was dismayed. 'I hadn't thought about the details, but I imagined you would continue to live in the priory.'

'Ralph won't allow his child to be raised in a nunnery, especially if it's a boy.'

'So what will you do, go back to Earlscastle?'

'Yes.'

The child was nothing yet, of course; not a person, not even a baby, just a swelling in Philippa's belly. But all the same Merthin felt a stab of grief. Lolla had become the great joy of his life, and he had been looking forward eagerly to another child.

But at least he had Philippa for a little while longer. 'When will you go?' he asked.

'Immediately,' she said. She saw the look on his face, and tears came to her eyes. 'I can't tell you how sorry I am - but I would just feel wrong, making love to you and planning to return to Ralph. It would be the same with any two men. The fact that you're brothers just makes it uglier.'

His eyes blurred with tears. 'So it's over with us already? Now?'

She nodded. 'And there's another thing I have to tell you, one more reason why we can never be lovers again. I've confessed my adultery.'

Merthin knew that Philippa had her own personal confessor, as was appropriate for a high-ranking noblewoman. Since she came to Kingsbridge, he had been living with the monks, a welcome addition to their thinned ranks. So now she had told him of her affair. Merthin hoped he could keep the secrets of the confessional.

Philippa said: 'I have received absolution, but I must not continue the sin.'

Merthin nodded. She was right. They had both sinned. She had betrayed her husband, and he had betrayed his brother. She had an excuse: she had been forced into the marriage. He had none. A beautiful woman had fallen in love with him and he had loved her back, even though he had no right. The yearning ache of grief and loss he was feeling now was the natural consequence of such behavior.

He looked at her - the cool gray-green eyes, the smashed mouth, the ripe body - and realized that he had lost her. Perhaps he had never really had her. In any case it had always been wrong, and now it was over. He tried to speak, to say good-bye, but his throat seemed to seize up, and nothing came out. He could hardly see for crying. He turned away, fumbled for the door, and somehow got out of the room.

A nun was coming along the corridor carrying a jug. He could not see who it was, but he recognized Caris's voice when she said: 'Merthin? Are you all right?'

He made no reply. He went in the opposite direction and passed through the door and down the outside staircase. Weeping openly, not caring who saw, he walked across the cathedral green, down the main street, and across the bridge to his island.
