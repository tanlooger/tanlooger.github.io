1. Moving from serial to parallel reading in the course of learning to read: Zoccolotti et al., 2005.

2. Longitudinal brain imaging of the acquisition of reading: Dehaene-Lambertz et al., 2018.

3. Contribution of parietal cortex to expert reading, only for degraded words: Cohen, Dehaene, Vinckier, Jobert, and Montavont, 2008; Vinckier et al., 2006.

4. Visual recognition of frequent combinations of letters: Binder, Medler, Westbury, Liebenthal, and Buchanan, 2006; Dehaene, Cohen, Sigman, and Vinckier, 2005;Grainger and Whitney, 2004; Vinckier et al., 2007.

5. Tuning of early visual cortex to letter perception: Chang et al., 2015; Dehaene et al., 2010; Sigman et al., 2005; Szwed et al., 2011, 2014.

6. Unconscious reading: Dehaene et al., 2001, 2004.

7. Automatization of arithmetic: Ansari and Dhital, 2006; Rivera, Reiss, Eckert, and Menon, 2005. The hippocampus also seems to strongly contribute to the memory for arithmetic facts: Qin et al., 2014.

8. Sleep interrupts the forgetting curve: Jenkins and Dallenbach, 1924.

9. REM sleep improves learning: Karni, Tanne, Rubenstein, Askenasy, and Sagi, 1994.

10. Sleep and the consolidation of recent learning: Huber, Ghilardi, Massimini, and Tononi, 2004; Stickgold, 2005; Walker, Brakefield, Hobson, and Stickgold, 2003; Walker and Stickgold, 2004.

11. Overexpression of the zif-268 gene during sleep: Ribeiro, Goyal, Mello, and Pavlides, 1999.

12. Neuronal replay during the night: Ji and Wilson, 2007; Louie and Wilson, 2001; Skaggs and McNaughton, 1996; Wilson and McNaughton, 1994.

13. Decoding brain activity during sleep: Chen and Wilson, 2017; Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, and Kamitani, 2013.

14. Theories of the memory function of sleep: Diekelmann and Born, 2010.

15. Replay during sleep facilitates memory consolidation: Ramanathan, Gulati, and Ganguly, 2015; see also Norimoto et al., 2018, for the direct effect of sleep on synaptic plasticity.

16. Cortical and hippocampal reactivation during sleep in humans: Horikawa et al., 2013; Jiang et al., 2017; Peigneux et al., 2004.

17. Increased slow wave sleep and post-sleep performance improvement: Huber et al., 2004.

18. Brain imaging of the effects of sleep on motor learning: Walker, Stickgold, Alsop, Gaab, and Schlaug, 2005.

19. Boosting slow oscillations during sleep improves memory: Marshall, Helgadóttir, Mölle, and Born, 2006; Ngo, Martinetz, Born, and Mölle, 2013.

20. Odors can bias memory consolidation during sleep: Rasch, Büchel, Gais, and Born, 2007.

21. Sounds can bias replay during sleep and improve subsequent memory: Antony, Gobel, O’Hare, Reber, and Paller, 2012; Bendor and Wilson, 2012; Rudoy, Voss, Westerberg, and Paller, 2009.

22. No learning of novel facts during sleep: Bruce et al., 1970; Emmons and Simon, 1956. Nevertheless, a very recent study suggests that during sleep, we may be able to learn the association between a tone and a smell (Arzi et al., 2012).

26. Hypothesis that the memory function of sleep may be more efficient in humans: Samson and Nunn, 2015.

27. Greater efficiency of sleep in children than in adults: Wilhelm et al., 2013.

28. Babies generalize word meanings after sleeping: Friedrich, Wilhelm, Born, and Friederici, 2015; Seehagen, Konrad, Herbert, and Schneider, 2015.

29. Positive effect of naps in preschoolers: Kurdziel, Duclos, and Spencer, 2013.

30. Sleep deficits and attention disorders: Avior et al., 2004; Cortese et al., 2013; Hiscock et al., 2015; Prehn-Kristensen et al., 2014.
