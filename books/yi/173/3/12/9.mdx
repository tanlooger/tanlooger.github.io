1. Grothendieck, 1986.

2. John Hattie’s meta-analysis grants feedback an effect size of 0.73 standard deviations, which makes it one of the most powerful modulators of learning (Hattie, 2008).

3. Rescorla-Wagner learning rule: Rescorla and Wagner, 1972.

4. For a detailed criticism of associative learning, see Balsam and Gallistel, 2009;Gallistel, 1990.

5. Blocking of animal conditioning: Beckers, Miller, De Houwer, and Urushihara, 2006; Fanselow, 1998; Waelti, Dickinson, and Schultz, 2001.

6. Surprise enhances infants’ learning and exploration: Stahl and Feigenson, 2015.

7. Error signals in the brain: Friston, 2005; Naatanen, Paavilainen, Rinne, and Alho, 2007; Schultz, Dayan, and Montague, 1997.

8. Surprise reflects the violation of a prediction: Strauss et al., 2015; Todorovic and de Lange, 2012.

9. Hierarchy of local and global error signals: Bekinschtein et al., 2009; Strauss et al., 2015; Uhrig, Dehaene, and Jarraya, 2014; Wang et al., 2015.

10. Surprise due to an unexpected picture: Meyer and Olson, 2011.

11. Surprise due to a semantic violation: Curran, Tucker, Kutas, and Posner, 1993; Kutas and Federmeier, 2011; Kutas and Hillyard, 1980.

12. Surprise due to a grammatical violation: Friederici, 2002; Hahne and Friederici, 1999; but see also Steinhauer and Drury, 2012, for a critical discussion.

13. Prediction error in the dopamine network: Pessiglione, Seymour, Flandin, Dolan, and Frith, 2006; Schultz et al., 1997; Waelti et al., 2001.

14. Importance of high-quality feedback at school: Hattie, 2008.
