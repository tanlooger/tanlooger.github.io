为吹号手吹响号角


有一个生活在十三世纪的男孩，他的勇气和爱国情怀直到今天还激荡在特定的铜号声中，那是一首“未完成”的曲子，因为就在他吹奏铜号的时候，入侵的鞑靼人一箭射中了他的胸膛。

有一个生活在十五世纪的男孩，在同一座塔楼，用同一个号角，不得不又吹响了那首曲子，这一次他吹完了，作为信号暗示另一队敌人的到来。

有一个生活在二十世纪的男人，他听到了那首每小时被准时吹响的古老的不完整乐曲，塑造了第二个男孩的形象，虚构了一个振奋人心的接近真实的故事，创作出当代最受欢迎的冒险小说。

这本书一定深深吸引着它的读者，因为人们完全不介意书名中的陌生名字——克拉科夫[1]——这个不为众人所知的城市，而且在一九二八年前它从未在儿童读物中出现过。学校的历史课或者传奇故事里也没有提到过一个名字与众不同的“卡济米尔·亚盖洛”国王。但凯利先生的作品让我们感受到了他对中世纪波兰的迷恋，那座古老而陌生的城市和形形色色的人物在他的笔下活灵活现、扣人心弦。我们被带入一个遍地炼金术士和铠甲骑士的世界，一个有着善良神父和可怕恶棍的国度，这个世界以小约瑟夫的视角展现在我们眼前。我们和他一起看到伟大的国王为他的家人平反，以及传世之宝“塔尔诺夫大水晶球”戏剧性的宿命。

这是一本好书，至少它为成长中的青少年打开了一扇了解波兰历史的窗户。一九二八年秋天出版后，它立即获得了评论界的广泛赞誉。孩子们和评论员一样渴望着阅读其中的内容。人们把这本书当作一个特别的发现，口口相传。这本书出版后的几个月内，一家图书馆写信告诉我，由于一遍又一遍地抄写，摆在他们书架上的这本书已经磨损破烂了。

本书在波兰也大受欢迎，并被称为“波兰人和英勇的美国人之间友谊和互相理解的标志”。克拉科夫的市议员满心感激，将至今仍然在圣玛利亚教堂吹响的一把历史悠久的银号借给了作者和出版商。凯利先生在纽约公共图书馆举办的图书周见面会上讲述了这本书的诞生过程，那时他常常光顾那座吹响“不完整乐曲”的教堂，拿着手表站在那里。

“当另一个号角在克拉科夫的上空吹响时，你会听到波兰人皆知的英雄主义的象征，这是克拉科夫为你而吹起的号角。”

他指向门口的位置，我带来的一位纽约警察乐队成员正站在那里。号声响起，嘹亮而澎湃。那是一个伟大的时刻！没有人知道，这位魁梧的警察之前并不懂得乐谱，我不得不匆忙把他带到地下室，教他反复练习吹奏这首曲子。

这把古老的号角之后继续被展出，盛放号角的天鹅绒盒子每侧都有一面国旗。这个号角一年内走遍美国，被陈列在书店里，在学校和图书馆被吹响。这个号角比那段时间古老塔楼所使用的号角还要珍贵。

当这本书一九二九年在华盛顿特区被授予纽伯瑞奖的时候，号声也响彻了美国图书馆协会会议的上空。凯利先生在领奖时，如是说：

“我不知道各位是否把这称作乐曲，在我看来，这是一种从克拉科夫城传来的震动，让我心潮涌动……在波兰重生后，我第一次来到克拉科夫，突然听到了巨大的钟声低沉地在我的头顶上空响起，然后是小钟发出的警报，我看到闲庭信步的鸽子被这声音吓到，像雪花一样四散而去。当一切回归平静，羽翼飘荡的高空响起了号声《海那圣歌》……我无法形容自己的感受。我兴奋地想要高声尖叫，想站到自己的头顶上唱歌跳舞。我的心脏开始轻柔却沉郁有力地跳动，似乎能溅起激动的火花。

“这种痴迷再未离我而去。在那之后，我又回到波兰修学。那时，我每天都会在教堂的高墙内待上一段时间。早上、中午、夜晚到深夜的每一个时间段，我都到过那里，有时候甚至凌晨就跑去……因为我爱着它。它见证了我灵魂所经历的每一种情绪，也传达了我心中的每一份欢乐。”

媒体人的敏锐观察力与诗意的情感表达相融合，造就了这部不同寻常的作品。

凯利先生对波兰的爱起源于第一次世界大战期间，那时他被派到法国，参加对波兰军队的抚恤工作。波兰解放后，他和军队一同回到波兰，在那里待了三年，并三次获得政府颁发的奖章。一九二四年，在纽约卡斯基斯科基金会（Kosciuszko Foundation）的赞助下，他再次来到波兰进行了为期一年的授课和研究。他原本想写一本严肃正统、贴合实际的书，但最终被这个地方和这个地方的人所感染，创作出了这部浪漫的小说。

这本书成功之后，他又创作了两则故事：一则关于波兰历史中的危机，也是儿童读物；另一则是圣诞节故事，名为《洁净的干草之中》（In Clean Hay）。他还创作了其他作品，在此不作赘述。他在达特茅斯教授英国文学和波兰历史，退休后在缅因海岸附近的一座岛上生活并进行写作。一九六零年，他在岛上去世。他的教学和他的作品将永远活在他所热爱的那两个国度。

克拉科夫吹号手的古老誓言


我以波兰人和波兰国王的忠实仆从的荣誉宣誓：我将忠实履行职责，至死不渝，如果有需要，我会时刻在担负圣母之名的教堂塔楼吹响《海那圣歌》，以颂扬圣母之荣誉。





未完成的音符


那是一二四一年的春天，流言沿着基辅的公路在罗斯大地上传播，“东边的鞑靼人又要进攻了”。这个消息让男人颤抖，女人下意识地将孩子紧紧搂在胸前，仅仅是“鞑靼人”这几个字眼就能让人血液凝结。随着时间的推移，流言传得越来越凶，甚至传到了我们的田野之乡——波兰，消息传说乌克兰的国土已经成了一片火海。然后，人们传说基辅已经沦陷，紧接着是雄狮之城利沃夫。现在，野蛮大军和美丽的克拉科夫城之间，除了几座平静的村庄和平坦肥沃的田野，已经别无障碍。

鞑靼人就像一群来势汹汹的野兽，所到之处，不放过任何生灵，甚至不留任何一片嫩绿的麦苗。鞑靼人个头矮小，皮肤黝黑，留着粗犷杂乱的连鬓胡子，把长头发编成小辫子，他们骑着矮马，马背上挂满了从战争中掳夺的战利品。他们勇猛如狮，有着熊心豹胆，但又铁石心肠，毫无悲悯之心，更别说温柔谦和了，他们甚至无视神明。他们在马背上挂着皮革和铁制成的圆盾，长矛从马鞍垂下。他们在肩膀和大腿上裹着兽皮。有的人戴着金灿灿的耳环，有的还戴着金鼻环。鞑靼人一路向前，矮马蹄子踏过土地，尘土漫天，马蹄声如闷雷一般，几里地以外就能听到。他们的队伍庞大，整个队伍要通过某个地方都得好几天，更别说队伍后面还跟着绵延了几里地远的载着奴隶、战备和劫掠之物的车子——他们抢来的大多数是金银财宝。

鞑靼大军到来之前，人们往往早已闻风而逃，开始背井离乡，形成一支绝望的长队；他们告别曾经生活的农舍，做出了死亡般苦涩的诀别。战时最遭罪的总是那些无辜的百姓——这些贫穷无助的农民赶着马车，带着家畜家禽跋涉在尘土之中，以免被甩到后面，遭受厄运。队伍中的老人身体羸弱，甚至没有力气想想房子，还有哄孩子的妇女，女人们因病而虚弱，男人们因失去了一生劳作的成果而心碎。小孩们拖着疲惫的身体走在大人身旁，怀里还常常抱着他们的宠物。

克拉科夫城向这群人敞开了大门，同时做好了防御的准备。与此同时，许多贵族和富庶人家要么逃到了西部，要么已经去了远在北边的修道院寻求庇佑。城外不远就是兹维日涅茨，那里有一座修道院，院内的修士尽最大可能去收留难民，只要还有地方，他们就提供住宿，而且准备抵挡围攻。不过，对于饱受恐慌、疲惫不堪的逃亡大军来说，能够在鞑靼人追来之前顺利进城就已经心满意足了。他们刚一进城，就都将脸转向南方，因为就在克拉科夫城的南边，维斯瓦河畔的嶙峋高山之上，耸立着宏大的、房屋错落的，并带有角楼的大片建筑群，那便是瓦维尔城堡——从传奇的克拉库斯国王开始，历代波兰国王就都以那里为堡垒，那也是组成皇室的公爵和贵族们的住所。

为了不造成重大的人员伤亡，克拉科夫的守城军队已经决定放弃在城堡门外进行防御。于是，接下来的几天中，留在城里的人们和从全国各地赶来的难民都涌进城堡，并在城堡的墙内安顿下来。古堡的城门位于圣安德鲁教堂对面的城堡公路上，士兵们最后关上城门并挡上了障碍物，城墙上的士兵严阵以待，决定誓死保护老城和他们的家人。

鞑靼人烧毁了城墙外围的村庄，将圣弗洛里安教堂、圣约翰教堂和圣十字教堂的周围劫掠一空，在夜晚时分他们兵临克拉科夫城下。接下来的一整夜都充斥着各种可怕的声音——大火噼啪的燃烧声、敌人发现猎物逃走后的咆哮声、发现黄金和财宝时得意的呼叫声。当清晨来临，瓦维尔城堡的哨兵眺望城镇时，仅有三座教堂还没有燃起大火——大集市附近的圣母玛利亚教堂、伟岸屹立在城门边上的圣安德鲁教堂，以及集市中央的圣阿达尔伯特教堂。黑村中的犹太人聚居地已经不复存在了，那些没来得及躲进城墙内的难民也都没能幸免于难。仅有一个男人，更确切地说，是一个年轻人，在灾难中活了下来。

他就是圣玛利亚教堂的吹号手，像其他的号手一样，他曾庄严地宣誓，每个小时在教堂前顶的阳台上吹响号角。清晨的第一缕阳光刚刚将维斯瓦河从一条黑线变成跳荡的金色时，他就登上阳台，吹响《海那圣歌》——教堂的每一位吹号手都曾宣誓，要每小时吹响一次这首献给圣母的赞歌，不分昼夜，“至死不渝”。当清晨的阳光洒在他身上时，他感到一阵莫名的喜悦，刚刚过去的那个夜晚是如此可怕，这种可怕既源于黑暗本身，也源于人类残忍无情所致的阴暗。

在他下方，矮小凶猛的鞑靼人正站在城市的公路上，满脸好奇地盯着他的一举一动。周围的房顶上时不时地溅起火苗，冒出团团黑烟。成百上千的住所被大火烧焦，毁于一旦。如今，他孤身一人，被可怕的敌人重重包围——他本可以在前一天逃之夭夭，与难民和城市居民一同进入城堡，但他最终选择忠于自己的誓言，坚守自己的岗位，除非被迫离开。不过，现在撤退已经来不及了。

这个吹号手是个年轻人，大概只有十九岁或二十岁。他穿着一件深色的布衣，裤腿处由带扣束着，样式和后来的灯笼裤相似，厚厚的深色紧身裤一直从膝盖延伸到软面的尖头凉鞋上，一件短外套下摆垂在腰际，由一条腰带束起。他头上戴着皮质的帽子，像是一个大风帽，长长的帽尾垂在肩头，其余部分包着头，仅仅露出脸和少量头发。

“我母亲和姐姐应该是安全的，”他心里想着，“感谢上帝！她们已经出发十天，现在一定已经到了远在摩拉维亚的表亲家。”

此时，他感到生活是如此甜美。维斯瓦河上空的太阳映照在瓦维尔大教堂的窗户上，那里的牧师已经开始做弥撒了。他可以看到，所有城门楼上的卫兵都全副武装，阳光照耀着他们的铠甲。一面绘有白鹰的旗帜高高飘扬在大吊桥所在的城门上方。

“波兰不死。”他心想。

他虽然年纪轻轻，心里却坚认自己是光荣的波兰人中的一员，为了整个基督教世界，与凶残野蛮的侵略者斗争。在那一刻之前，他并未见过什么死伤——他也只是隐约听说过而已。而现在，为了他的誓言，为了他对教堂的爱，为了他对波兰的爱，他或许就将直面死亡。

“我将坚守诺言，”他心里默想着，“即使为之付出生命也在所不惜，我的誓言和生命同样重要。”

如果画家能够捕捉到他当时的表情，那肯定是一个最为安详平和的画面，一种意味着上帝就在身边的神情。没有任何软弱，没有犹豫，甚至没有痛苦——他并没有考虑在履行完自己的职责后会遭遇什么。沙漏里的沙子已经流到了整点的位置，该吹响号角了。

“现在，为了波兰和圣母，我将吹响《海那圣歌》。”他一边想，一边将号角递到唇边。

开始时，他轻吹号角——紧接着他心里激荡起一种胜利感，一种近乎狂喜的快乐涌上心头。他似乎看见了一幅画面——尽管他将孤独地死去，仅仅是为了某些人所嘲笑的愚蠢的荣誉，但他坚信这种勇敢将成为民族的遗产，成为波兰人精神的组成部分，成为他们勇气的来源以及力量的源泉。一切就在这一刻。

下方一名鞑靼士兵屈身拿起弓箭，用力将箭向后拉。弓弦一颤，深色的箭就像一只敏捷的鸟径直向目标飞去。箭头穿过了年轻吹号手的胸膛，而此时的圣歌已经接近尾声——音符微颤，圣歌停止了。但年轻的号手依然紧握着号角，他的身体向后倒在阳台的支撑墙上，同时他吹响了最后一个光荣的音符。这个音符开始时强劲，紧接着微微颤抖了一下，然后结束了，和给予这个音符生命的年轻生命一同休止——正在那时，教堂下的野蛮人将木结构的教堂付之一炬，熊熊大火带着年轻吹号手的灵魂直上天堂。





第一章　不愿卖南瓜的人


那是一四六一年七月下旬的一个清晨，炽热火红的太阳从天边升起，仿佛拉开了盛夏最热一天的序幕。晨光洒落在克拉科夫古城，照耀着一条条通向老城的道路。农民们赶着货车，成群结队地从路上颠簸碾压而过。这些货车大多由一匹马拉着，马套在单根粗木制成的车辕上；车轮是用结实的圆木板紧紧钉在一起而成，切削过的边缘用火烘烤过后更加硬实；车身的底板是纵横交错的粗糙板子；车子的两侧和前后用柳条和芦苇编织而成。乍一看，整个货车就像是个行驶在轮子上的巨大篮子。这些货车沿着凹凸不平的粗糙路面前行，穿过田野，跨越溪流，就像一条条在风浪中起伏摇摆的小船。

车夫走在货车的一旁，不时地在马背上轻甩长鞭，给牲口加点劲，妇女和小孩子则耐心地坐在车上。

车上装载着各种各样的商品——蔬菜、花卉、鸭、鸡、鹅、猪，还有黄油和牛奶。有的车夫运送着一车兽皮，有的仅仅是拉着一车用来滋养城市花园的黑土，还有的拉着一车家禽，脖子上还挂着用线穿起来的干香菇，看上去像是戴了一串串珠链。他们的身后是喀尔巴阡山脉绵延的山麓丘陵，在朝阳和晨雾中身披金光。不远处的维斯瓦河，就像一只银色的手镯环在瓦维尔山上。空气中弥漫着湿润的青草、新鲜的泥土以及万物生长的清新气息。

开市时间到了。许多货车在克拉科夫、塔尔诺夫、利沃夫和基辅的小路上行驶了一夜，终于踏上主路，纷至沓来。有的货车已经在路上走了两天两夜，从遥远的边陲地区赶来。市集上的人形形色色，有从中心城区来的打扮入时的男女，有穿长衫戴圆帽的赤脚农民，有身穿粗布衣衫围着亮丽丝巾的农妇，还有十二个来自犹太村庄的男人，身穿黑色长袍，头戴黑色帽子，耳际留着特色的鬈发。

当地施拉赫塔[1]的侍从也来到集市，这些男孩身上穿着皮质的服装，看起来比脏兮兮的农夫体面许多。市集上随处可见抱着婴儿的妇女，还有一些老人艰难地行走在去往集市的货车之间，一如过去三四十年的做法。

不过，赶车队伍中的男人们个个都携带着某种武器，要么在腰带上别着短刀，要么手里拿着六尺棍，或是在货车底部放着大板斧。因为集市期间会有许多盗贼出没，据说甚至还有破了财而无力东山再起的乡绅也会盯着这些货车，想要借此弥补一下自己的损失。往往在回程的路上盗贼更为猖獗，因为在经过了一天的讨价还价之后，每个农民都能赚到些钱。

与这些装载着货物的货车相比，有一辆车在这热闹的集市日显得离奇的空荡。这辆车与普通货车不同，是由两匹马驾着，轴杆比其他马车更为结实，车上人的穿着也比普通农民讲究，怎么看也不像是庄稼人。坐在车里的人，有一个约莫四十五岁的男人，一个比他年轻十来岁的女人，那是他的妻子；另外有一个男孩，坐在敞开的马车后端，两条腿在公路上飞扬的尘土和污泥间晃来晃去。

“亲爱的，”男人一边叫着他的妻子，一边挥起长鞭抽在马背上——他的妻子坐在马车前端他旁边的一张简陋座位上——“看见那座高塔了吗？那就是克拉科夫瓦维尔山上的哨塔。我们要是能像鹳鸟一样飞行，八点前就能到那里了。看！圣玛利亚教堂的两座高塔就在远处，在车上颠簸了三个礼拜，看到这幅景象，我真是觉得愉快。”

女人把灰色的兜帽向后拉下，露出脸来，满眼渴望地看向前方。“那就是克拉科夫了，”女人说着，“那是我母亲的故乡，她常常向我讲起克拉科夫城的辉煌，而我却从未想过有一天会见到它，真不愿意以这种伤心的方式和它相见。不过，我们也只能遵从上帝的旨意。终于快到了。”

“是啊。”男人感叹道。

接下来很长一段时间，他们都沉默不语。男人默默回想着自己早年在克拉科夫的经历，女人思念着她在乌克兰失去的家园，而男孩则天马行空地胡思乱想，猜测着将要在大城市中见到的各种情形。

他们各有所思，但他们身后的货车突然出现一阵骚乱，把他们带回了现实。车夫们都勒住缰绳，将马牵到路的左侧，好给后面的人尽可能让出一条路来。男人回过神，掉转头，试图辨认出那个要从货车长龙中穿过的人，很快他就看到一个骑着小马的人从远处赶来。

“让开！让开！”骑马的人喊着，“你们这些村夫！以为整条路都是你们的吗！……待在你们的农场里，那才是你们该待的地方！”他气势汹汹地朝一个赶车的农夫喊着，因为那农夫的马突然从路边跳到了路中间。“给人留点地方！管好你那畜生，突然跳到路中间，成何体统！”

“我都要掉到沟里了。”农夫谦逊地回答。

骑马的人迅速扫了一眼农夫车上的东西，确定车上只有一些要卖给砖瓦匠的新鲜干草之后，就赶着他的矮马继续向前，直到追上了那个男人、女人和男孩所乘坐的马车。

一家人一直好奇地看着这个逐渐靠近的人。车上的男孩名叫约瑟夫·恰尔涅茨基，年方十五岁，长得一点也不英俊，但也绝不难看。头发黝黑，眼睛也黑溜溜的，圆圆的脸很是讨人喜爱。他的穿着比较讲究，虽然在旅途中沾满了尘土，但他裤子的布料既不是仆从穿的皮革，也不是农民们穿的粗麻布，而是自家织的上等布料；上身是一件同样布料缝制的厚实外套，带纽扣，像裙子一样拖到膝盖的位置。他脚上穿着棕色的皮靴，高高的靴筒宽松而软和，都快和外套的底边连起来了。他头上还戴着一顶圆圆的无檐帽，有点像土耳其人的头巾。

骑马人一接近男孩就用沙哑的声音叫唤着：“小孩！小孩！让你家老头拴住马，你过来给我牵马！”

男孩没有拒绝，他跳下马车，抓住马的缰绳，心里认定这个人来者不善。那时候的世界刚刚逃离黑暗残酷，每个人都不得不随时对他人保持戒备。盗徒猖獗；心存嫉妒的朋友经常使出卑鄙的伎俩；贵族出身的人把欺骗穷苦农民当成儿戏；那些穷人之中也不乏为了获取钱财而犯下罪行的人。

所以，在约瑟夫抓住缰绳的时候，他就意识到一定要小心对待这个男人，也许是因为他从这个陌生人的眼神或者言谈举止中看出了些什么。这个人身穿厚重的衣服，看打扮像是个仆人，身上的外套有些短，能看到里面穿着的轻薄铠甲。他下身穿的是紧身马裤，而不是灯笼裤，还有一块将上衣和裤子连成整体的皮料。他头戴圆帽，上面还挂着宝石链，也可能是玻璃的，在他脖子后面晃荡。

然而，正是这个人的脸出卖了他的灵魂。那张黑色的圆脸上充满邪恶，一双眼眯着、泛着绿光，两道眉毛直直地在鼻梁上相交，怎么看都更像一只猴子，而不像个人。他的右侧脸上有一块纽扣状的疤，那是一种在伏尔加河东部甚至是第聂伯河等地非常普遍的疫病留下的疤痕，是鞑靼人、哥萨克人或蒙古人的标记。另外，他的双耳下垂，非常难看。他的嘴就像是小孩子万圣节的时候在南瓜上割开的那一道口子。嘴唇上方的胡子两端乱糟糟地耷拉着，凌乱地和络腮胡子连成一片。他的腰间别着一把短短的弯刀，外套下面还隐约可见一把镶嵌着珠宝的东方匕首。

男孩刚一抓住马缰绳，男人就跳下马来，一下子跃到了马车前面。约瑟夫的父亲迅速把手伸进马车座位底部，拿出一把十字柄的短剑。

“别再靠近了！”他朝着那个男人大喊，此时男人正双手前伸，仿佛要抓住他的手，“虽然我不知道你是谁，但上帝做证，我一定会查出你的底细。”

陌生人停下了脚步，微笑地看着对方即将出鞘的剑，突然严肃起来，紧接着摘下帽子深鞠了一躬，恭敬地说道：“想必您就是安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基了。”

“你冒昧了，”车夫回答，“陌生人应该称呼我安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基先生。”

陌生人又鞠了一躬，说道：“我刚才是以平等身份向您致意，我是海乌姆的斯蒂芬·奥斯特洛夫斯基，刚从基辅办完事回来。众所周知，一名莫斯科人和我们立陶宛的几个省有要事往来，我就是受人委派——至于是谁就不方便提及了——是来了解……”他突然停下了，好像要给人一种此事不宜让人知晓的感觉。“但是在我回家的路上，人们告诉我鞑靼人的军队从克里米亚北上，四处烧杀抢掠。他们烧毁了大量房屋，破坏了大量的农田，其中就有安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基的地产——哦，请您见谅，是安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基先生。据说，他们一家人正在逃往克拉科夫，投奔那里的朋友。这应该无误。鉴于我也是同路，问到了安德鲁先生和他家人的相貌。今天早上我看到了一辆乌克兰的马车，由两匹马拉着而不是一匹马，而车上的男人、女人和孩子的样子也与我听到的描述一致，就特此向您做个自我介绍，并问候您一声。”

恰尔涅茨基先生仔细地打量着这个陌生人的脸、穿着以及身材。“你的话还没有说完吧？”他说。

“的确，”陌生人回答道，“但剩下的，可能需要我们到达克拉科夫城之后，在厚重的房门之后私下谈论吧。我听说……”他的语气意味深长，然后用手在空中比画出一个圈。

恰尔涅茨基眯着眼睛看着这个人，好让自己把注意力集中在他的身上，而不受到外界的干扰。他的外表虽然看起来平和淡定，但内心却并不冷静沉着。事实上，这个陌生人的手势让他的心怦怦直跳。他知道这个男人嘴里吐出的每一个字几乎全是假的，他知道他的名字并不是奥斯特洛夫斯基，尽管海乌姆确实有一些姓奥斯特洛夫斯基的人家——他长得也一点都不像波兰人。而且他说最后一句话的语气还带着一丝威胁。恰尔涅茨基意识到这根本不是偶遇。他们离开边境已经超过十四天了。他推测这个男人应该一路都跟着他们，也可能是受某个有地位的人指使，要在他们进城之前把他们截住。

“你所听到的与我没有半点关系，”他简短地说，“现在，我已经掉队了，能否请你回到你的马上？我们之间没有什么可说的，而我对你也不感兴趣。”

恰尔涅茨基说得没错，前面的货车已经走远了，而后面的车夫正因为道路阻塞而气愤地朝他嚷嚷着。

“恰恰相反，”陌生人回答道，“你有一样我非常感兴趣的东西。除非我们到了城里某个安全的地方，否则我是不会离开你们的。过来，小孩儿，”他朝约瑟夫喊道，“把我的马牵到马车后面，接下来，我要和你们一起走。”

听到这话，恰尔涅茨基先生的脸一下子涨红了，“你现在明显太放肆了，”他义正词严地说道，“赶快说明你有什么事，说完就滚蛋！”

陌生人扫了一眼马车，目光锁定在车夫座位前面的一个巨大的金色南瓜上。“哈，”他说，“南瓜？这个时节还有南瓜？看来，大草原上冬天还长南瓜呢。这南瓜怎么卖？”

“这不卖。”恰尔涅茨基回答。

“不卖？”

“我说了，不卖。”

“我要是出和这个南瓜重量一样的金子呢？”

“那也不卖。”

“你不卖这个南瓜？”

“告诉你了，我不卖。”

“那么，”——陌生人迅速抽出了剑——“那就接招吧！”说着就冲向了车夫。

恰尔涅茨基也毫不犹豫，转眼间他就跳过马车上的座位，躲过了刺来的剑，并用手紧紧地抓住了陌生人的右手腕，当啷一声，对方的剑落到了地上。恰尔涅茨基并没有放手，他挥起左手抓住陌生人的小腿，紧锁住陌生人的胳膊和腿，将他高高举起，然后一下将他扔出马车。陌生人狠狠地跌入泥里，气急败坏地骂着脏话，狠狠诅咒着恰尔涅茨基。而约瑟夫有着令人惊叹的先见之明，他瞅准机会给马掉了个头，又在马身的右侧狠狠一击。马暴跳而起，逆着马车赶来的方向飞速奔去。同时，约瑟夫跃上了马车，向他的父亲喊着，恰尔涅茨基返回座位，长鞭挥向马头。转眼间他们就走远了，空留陌生人站在道路中间，东瞅瞅，西望望，似乎是不知道该追马还是该追人。恰尔涅茨基回转身，从马车的底板上捡起陌生人的剑，扔到了路上。

不久之后，他们就到了卡济米尔国王一百多年前建立的犹太城市卡其米日城。穿过卡其米日城，跨过一条横在维斯瓦河的小桥，就是克拉科夫城。可惜这座桥正在维修，他们不得不选择北边的另一座桥。之后他们来到了壁垒森严的米克雷斯卡门，并在那里接受守城人的盘问。

第二章　克拉科夫城


“本人恰尔涅茨基，是一名基督徒，这是我的妻子和儿子。”安德鲁先生向一名身穿轻薄铠甲、手拿战戟的卫兵说道。

卫兵快速扫了一眼这一家人，然后示意他们可以放行。另一个穿着黑衣的卫兵向车里看了看，并没有发现什么东西，断定他们只是来城里赶集买东西的乡下人，就按照惯例收了几个铁币的税。交了钱，一家人就进了米克雷斯卡城门，踏上了去往位于城市正中央的老布楼的路。直到现在，老布楼还依旧在那里。

金色的阳光已经洒遍克拉科夫城。约瑟夫从未见过这么大的城市，他左顾右盼，眼前的一切都让他惊讶地张大了嘴。

行驶在他们马车前后的都是满载农产品的货车，排成了一条笔直的长龙。时不时地有威武的骑马者穿行在长龙之间，他们身穿光亮的金刚护甲，长剑垂在马鞍的一侧。一个衣着华丽的骑手从拥挤的队列中穿出，正好走在他们的马车前面，男孩心想这人一定位高权重，说不定就是国王，热爱和平的国王卡济米尔·亚盖洛——卡济米尔四世，他兴奋地喊道：“父亲，那一定是国王！你看他穿着金光闪闪的盔甲，马鞍上还镶着珠宝呢！他的剑亮闪闪的，就像是火苗一样，肯定是金子做的！还有……”他迫不及待地用手指着，“他的鞍褥上用银线绣着波兰之鹰，背景还有立陶宛的白衣骑士。他一定是国王吧？”

“不，儿子，那不是国王。那只不过是在皇家城堡侍奉贵族的普通士兵罢了。”

他们周围的一切，宫殿、教堂、高塔、城墙和哥特风格的建筑都被金色的阳光包裹着，不过大部分建筑都还很简朴，难以想象，几年后它们将在意大利文艺复兴的影响下改头换面，布满各种繁复的雕刻。远处，瓦维尔山上的天主教堂耸立在绿松石般的天空下，罗马风格的塔楼俯瞰着整座城市。近处，是由两座高塔组成的圣玛利亚大教堂，既没有单独的钟楼，也没有尖顶，只是屹立在公墓的上方，脚下簇拥着白色的墓碑。后来由于建筑大师和著名的雕塑家威特·斯特沃兹的改建，现如今我们看到的圣玛利亚教堂已经完全不同，不过这就是后话了。

老布楼就坐落在市场的正中央，周围是小型的木结构建筑。这里是进行布匹交易和买卖的地方，此时已经挤满商人，他们已经在路上奔波了一夜，甚至是好几个日夜，都想早点把货卖出，免得买家把钱花到别处。

布楼外的广场上，有几个从遥远的东边赶来的鞑靼人已经安营扎寨，在那里兜售一些精美的佩剑、布匹和珠宝，都是从莫斯科人、匈牙利人、希腊人或者从草原上的旅人那里掠夺来的战利品。当初升的太阳渐渐笼罩瓦维尔山时，他们都面朝东方，念诵着赞扬真主阿拉的祷告词。他们的祷告声和圣玛利亚教堂的钟声混合在一起，夹杂其中的还有亚美尼亚商人的叫卖声，这些亚美尼亚人从特拉比松以及黑海对岸带来了地毯、香料和精美的皮毡。

这个东西融汇的国际大都市敬奉着人类所知道的所有神明，甚至上帝自己也以很多名字被说着各种语言、各种方言的人所敬奉。土耳其人、哥萨克人、罗塞尼亚人、日耳曼人、佛兰芒人、捷克人以及斯洛伐克人把各种物品带到这里售卖，而匈牙利人带着特兰西瓦尼亚平原上盛产的醇香美酒。

这里流通的货币也是各种各样，有波兰的兹罗提、荷兰盾、德国的格罗申、银条、宝石以及各种实物代币——包括琥珀、成袋的大枣、装在容器里的蔬菜等各式商品，这些物品在汉萨同盟[1]的交易规则中都有公认的价值。这里也有同盟商人的代表，他们是穿着毛领长袍的日耳曼人或者荷兰人，他们和人们做生意时可以用各种语言。

当男孩被四面的景象所深深吸引的时候，街道的上空突然飘来一阵美妙的号声。他抬头望去，看见一只金色的号角从圣玛利亚大教堂塔楼的一扇窗户里伸出来。他仰着头，被教堂庄严的气势所压倒，他眼睛所感受到的安静力量和耳朵所听到的号乐声混合在一起，给他的感官带来了奇妙的震撼。

车水马龙的街道上空高耸着两座塔楼，一高一低，约瑟夫注意到，近处的这座塔楼似乎要比远处的那座略矮一些，那个号手就在高塔的顶楼吹奏小号。

他所吹奏的乐曲是一首简短的晨祷，叫作《海那圣歌》，据说是在基督教兴起早期由南方来的传教士带到波兰的。曲调简短轻快、美妙动听。但突然之间号手却停止了吹奏，仅留下一个中断的音符，从上空飘荡而下，仿佛有人在那一瞬间把小号夺走了。

约瑟夫惊讶地看向父亲，问道：“他怎么不吹完呢？”

安德鲁微笑着说：“说来话长，儿子，我以后再给你讲这个故事。”

号声再次响起，这次是从另一个窗口传来，接着是更远的窗口，最后是从北边，朝着弗洛里安城门的方向吹奏的。号手总共吹奏了四遍《海那圣歌》，但每次乐曲都戛然而止。

“他吹得非常蹩脚。”恰尔涅茨基先生评论道。

虽说安德鲁现在只是一个乡绅，但他在许多方面都造诣颇深。从克拉科夫大学毕业以后，他就决定不谋任何职业，而是按照家族传统，接管家里的田产。他一直热爱音乐，在大学期间就学过音乐，而且擅长铜管乐器，长号、圆号、带按键的号，他都游刃有余。所以，他评论塔楼上号手的演奏时，绝对不是夸夸其谈。

马车离老布楼越来越近，约瑟夫也不再询问父亲关于《海那圣歌》的故事，而是为眼前的奇妙景象所吸引。

映入他眼帘的是一群身穿明亮袍子的商人。他们的长衫用的都是上乘布料，有的还装饰着皮毛，边缘缀着丝绸，一看就是有钱人。他们在长衫下面穿着紧身的服饰，约瑟夫发现一个人穿的裤子，竟然左右裤腿的颜色不一样，这在他的眼里简直是荒唐可笑。不过，当他发现其他人也都是相同的打扮，都穿着紧身的裤腿而且两条裤腿的颜色不同，就忍住了笑，开始好奇地打量着。他这边还没搞明白，就发现了这些人装扮上的其他新奇之处。他们独特的帽饰像他们的紧身裤一样引人注意。他们都围着土耳其头巾，有的尖顶高耸，有的仅仅是把彩色的布随意地缠绕在头顶上。他们头上还戴着风格怪异的装饰——其中一人的帽子顶端甚至卧着一只假公鸡。这些商人的鞋子也很奇怪，都是软皮质的，鞋尖长长的、卷曲向上。还有一个人在鞋子的脚趾部位插着小棍，每只鞋看上去都有两只脚那么长。

老布楼周围的货摊前，小贩们大声地叫卖着各种货物。一个谷物货摊的前面摆着敞口的麻袋，里面装着各种颜色的谷物。一个女人身穿系肩扣的蓝袍，头上戴着用同色长布缠成的帽子，正在向一个过路的音乐家售卖粮食。这个音乐家穿着一件由一块布做成的黄色连身长衣，上面还连着一个蒙头斗篷，衣服一直垂到膝盖，他里面没穿裤子，还赤裸着双脚。长衣外面系着一条亮黄色的腰带。他用一只手臂夹着一支风笛，上面三个突出的管子，两个是发声口，剩下的一个是吹奏口；他的另一只手拿着一个皮口袋，女人正在往里面倒玉米。

恰尔涅茨基一家继续前行，经过了各种货摊和店铺。手套店里，无论是售货的还是挑选购买的女人们，都穿着色泽明亮的长袍；针匠店的店主穿着皮质的围裙，正惬意地躺在长椅上；然后就是铸剑铺，铸剑师正烧着熔炉，墙上挂着一排排闪闪发光的钢刃；还有做浴桶的人，正在组装木板；铁匠们穿着黑色的长围裙，努力把马固定住，准备给它们钉马蹄铁。这里随处可见挂着红色招牌的理发店和给人放血治疗[2]的店铺，以及门口挂着蓝色和绿色大烧瓶的药店。虔诚的天主教徒在商店的外墙上悬挂着从琴斯托霍瓦神庙请来的圣母画像。为了和周围的商家区别开来，几乎每个商人都会在店铺门上做出独特的标记，一个帽店门口挂着“白象之下”的标牌，一个鞋匠在门口立着一座卡济米尔大帝的石雕头像，用来取悦自己和来往的顾客。那时候的公共建筑还没有门牌号，所有的建筑都在大门外面挂一些装饰物，以便相互区别。

大街上到处都是商贩的叫卖声，他们要么吆喝着自己的商品，要么哼唱着自己的职业，有卖花的女孩、磨刀人、面包店的童工，还有屠夫的学徒。

“你想要什么？你想要什么？”他们异口同声地吆喝着。

让约瑟夫兴奋的是，街上偶尔还能碰到猴子，它们都是被东边或南方来的商人带来的。有的猴子绕着货摊玩耍，有的身上系着丝带，被商人或者大官的家眷抱在怀里。

在市场的喧嚣中，还能偶尔听到铁链的当啷声，那是一些可怜的人们戴着铁手铐，将要被押到教堂的高墙内监禁，也许更惨——在行刑前到教堂做最后一次的祷告。那时候的人们都胆战心惊地活着，稍有不慎就可能大祸临头，要么被流放，要么被监禁，甚至招致杀身之祸。

路上还有一队要去往某个神庙的朝圣者，他们从不同的村庄而来，有男有女，都穿着自己最体面的衣服，当地的牧师走在最前面，带领着整个队伍吟唱着圣歌。举着十字架的年轻人肩膀宽厚、眼睛明亮，而且身强体健，因为他发过誓要将上帝的神圣象征从故乡护送到很远的琴斯托霍瓦。这些人已经在路上走了十来天了，队伍中还有小孩子，有的一门心思、满脸严肃，有的则因为第一次见到中世纪克拉科夫的辉煌而东张西望，他们无疑会在之后的祷告中请求上帝原谅他们对俗世的贪恋。

马车驶出市场，拐进格罗兹卡街（也叫城堡街），直接朝瓦维尔山驶去。临近瓦维尔山的时候，安德鲁先生将马车赶到右侧，穿过一道城门，进入了一条长满青草的小路。小路尽头有一座宏伟而古老的宫殿，安德鲁把车赶到路边，敏捷地从车上跳下来，停在宫殿入口的大铁门前。一个全副武装的卫兵在门口用长矛挡住了他的路，略带敌意地盘问起来。

“你有何贵干？”卫兵厉声问道。

“我来找安德鲁·提辛斯基先生。”

卫兵喊了几句话，然后从大门附近的小屋里出来五个全身铠甲的男人。

“围住他！”卫兵喊道。他们这番举动令安德鲁先生非常吃惊。卫兵又命令道，“你们出一个人到里面，向队长报告！就说有一个乡下人想要见安德鲁·提辛斯基先生。”

安德鲁想要突出包围圈，但被其中的一个人挡了回来。他提高了语调，生气地说道：“你们是什么人，竟敢阻拦我？我是安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基，是提辛斯基的大表兄，我在乌克兰经营着大量田产。我要求你们的长官出来接待我，不要像对待敌人一样对我。”

这些卫兵一脸震惊，面面相觑。难道这个人还不知道真相？这件事已经传遍大半个波兰了啊。

不一会儿，队长和那个传话的士兵一同走了出来。他推开包围圈，径直走到了恰尔涅茨基先生的面前，问道：“请问您有何贵干？”他声音中显示出柔和的语气和恭敬的态度，让安德鲁暂时忘记了气愤。

“年轻人，你谈吐文质彬彬，”安德鲁说道，“应该是这里管事的了？”

“是的。”

“那我再把刚才对你手下说的话重复一遍，我叫安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基，从乌克兰到此，找我的表弟安德鲁·提辛斯基先生有要事相谈。”

“你来得太晚了，”卫兵队长回答说，“真是奇怪，你竟然没有听说，这个消息已经全国皆知了。安德鲁·提辛斯基先生已经不在人世了。他的亲友也已经离开这里一段时间了，我也不确定他们什么时候回来。我的任务是保护这里的财物免受敌对家族的破坏。”

安德鲁惊呆了，“我的表弟死了——怎么会这样？”

“这是这么多年以来城里发生的最惨重的一件事了。生意人和贵族之间一直水火不容。提辛斯基先生委托一位铁匠制作兵器，但他对其中的几件并不满意，事态就此恶化。他不仅找这个生意人的麻烦，而且拒绝支付工钱，于是整个行会就联合起来反对他。他们跟踪他，在他所藏身的方济会教堂将他杀害。这件事真是悲惨，他的家人由于害怕暴徒，已经逃离出城了。我们高贵的伊丽莎白王后——愿上帝保佑王后陛下——她讨厌流血冲突，劝说国王让市民和贵族之间和解。国王派我们驻守此地，以免再次发生流血事件，因为很多人可能会来窃夺或是将依然留守的仆人赶尽杀绝。我们必须执行国王的旨意，阻拦任何想要进入这里的人，为此请您见谅，因为我们只是为了避免更多的人员伤亡。”

安德鲁先生此时感觉天都要塌下来了。

“我可以给您一条建议。”队长继续说道。

“我洗耳恭听。”安德鲁若有所思地说。

“如果您和提辛斯基阁下有血缘关系，最好尽快出城；如果您选择留在城里，就要更名改姓，谨言慎行，免得有人谋财害命……那么，请接收我的致礼。另外，为了您的安全，请赶快离开吧。”

“但是，我必须留在这里。一群暴徒，也不知道是什么人，我想可能是受了某个位高权重之人的指使，烧毁了我在乌克兰的房舍，整个房子完全坍塌，连我的田地也被毁了。我来这里就是要投奔亲戚的，我来告诉他们一些非常机密的事情，而且要尽快报告给国王。”

“唉，”队长感叹道，“恕我无能为力。国王此刻正在托伦，据说那里有人在密谋反抗十字军的军令——国王要不惜一切代价维护北方和平。我不清楚国王何时回来，也许一个月，也许一年。如果你要在这里等待，我建议你先在城里安顿下来，然后换个名字。你放心，不久之后，那些谋害提辛斯基先生的人将会得到应有的惩罚，会被送上断头台，引来更多送葬的乌鸦。”

说完，他就转身离开，吩咐士兵各司其职。

安德鲁先生一动不动地在那里站了一会儿。他的脑袋乱哄哄的。他的朋友，他要投奔的人，死了！国王还远在外地！而他千里迢迢从乌克兰逃难到这里，最终还是无家可归，而且来自四面八方的敌人都向他施压，他不明白自己到底做了什么，竟然会遭此劫难。而且，即使他们的处境不像现在这么复杂，要无依无靠地在克拉科夫生存下来，也并不容易。他积累起的财富全都年复一年地投资到了他在乌克兰的房屋和田地上，现在他身上的钱并不多。他的妻儿需要一个避风的港湾，可他不仅毫无办法，而且还得应对无处不在的危机。他们在城门口已经遇上了敌人，城里显然还有更多。该怎么办呢？唉……上帝保佑……总会有办法的。

他茫然地回到马车上，掉转马头，准备再回到市场。他们可以在那里待上一天，给马饮水，再买点吃的填饱肚子。他在一处喷泉的附近找了一块地方，在约瑟夫的帮助下把马卸下，将它们带到市场边缘的矮草地吃草，然后用木桶盛上喷泉水饮马。

安顿好这一切之后，安德鲁去向妻子寻求安慰和帮助。每当遇到困难，她总是能帮他出谋划策，给他慰藉。他瘫坐到妻子身边的座位上，把刚才听到的消息告诉妻子，国王不在城里，而他的亲戚已经死了。这意想不到的困境让女人心头一颤，但一看到丈夫的脸，她就忘记了自己的感受，静静地说：“我们可以等，上帝会保佑我们的。”妻子的安慰让安德鲁又一次充满了勇气。

约瑟夫正处于无忧无虑的年纪，不会愁云紧锁。自从早上看到城里隐约出现的塔楼之后，他的心就兴奋得怦怦直跳，两条腿早已跃跃欲试。他迫不及待地跳下马车，想要出去探索一番。他先是走到不远处的一座小楼附近，他原本以为这是个市场，走近以后，才发现是个小教堂，上面是低矮的穹顶，旁边的墙上镶嵌着圆形的窗户。这是波兰最为古老的教堂之一，不过它只能吸引那些热衷于历史文化的人们，像约瑟夫这个年纪的孩子对此则完全不感兴趣。他反倒挨个儿打量起教堂门口的乞丐，一个只有一条腿的残疾男孩，一个驼背女人，一个双目失明的老人，他们一直在那里祷告求乞，还有许多可怜的人也在那里等待接济。约瑟夫在胸口画了一个十字，为这些可怜无助的人们祈祷了一阵，然后转身沿着格罗兹卡大街，朝瓦维尔的方向走去。

他来到一条交叉巷，巷子的左侧通向多米尼加教堂，右侧通向万圣教堂。这时，他注意到街上有一个鞑靼男孩正牵着一条乌克兰大狼狗，还不断地在后面抽打着这条狗。狼狗被拴着，脖子上戴着结实的手工项圈，时不时地回头看一眼那个折磨它的男孩——他正挥着一根哥萨克短皮鞭。约瑟夫惊讶地看着那个男孩，琢磨不透他是怎么得到这只狗的，又为什么要打自己的狗——事实上，这个男孩这么做，完全是出于恶意——而这两个问题约瑟夫都没有想明白。不过，几分钟后，又有一个问题如同闪电般突然出现，这个问题需要行动来做解答，而约瑟夫能够提供这个答案。

正在那个鞑靼男孩牵着狼狗穿过教堂街的时候，人行道的远处出现了一个人，他一身黑衣，很像一名神父，只是衣领的前面是开口的，不符合神职人员的装扮。不过此时，约瑟夫的注意力并不在这个人身上，而是被他的同伴所吸引。那是一个和约瑟夫年纪相仿的女孩，她走在黑衣男子的旁边，紧握着他的手。

约瑟夫暂时忘记了那条狼狗的境遇，目不转睛地看着那个女孩。在他眼里，这个女孩就像是圣诞节演出中的天使或者是三王节[3]的精灵一般——她简直就像是从教堂彩色玻璃画上走出来的美人。她的头发浅浅的（约瑟夫的头发颜色很深），皮肤像亚麻布一样白皙，一双眼睛就像维斯瓦河上方的天空一样湛蓝。她穿着一件红色的斗篷，从肩头一直垂到脚踝，腰间束着腰带。她的斗篷上镶着蓝边，领口和袖口装饰着蕾丝，前襟没有系紧，露出里面一件蓝色罩裙，带有褶皱的下摆比外套还长。当她仰起头的时候，约瑟夫的心头微微一颤，他可从未见过如此漂亮的少女——就连她走路的姿势都那么优美，就像踩在云朵上一样轻盈。约瑟夫低下头，看了看自己的手，又脏又糙；他又看了看自己的衣服，经过长途旅行后满是尘土，破旧不堪。

如果说这个女孩的美丽把他带入了天堂，那他很快就回到了现实。因为此时，就在鞑靼男孩带着狗与黑衣男子和女孩擦肩而过的时候，那条疯狂的狼狗突然不顾一切地扭过头，伏低身子猛地跃向鞑靼男孩。约瑟夫大喊着，在狗跳起的一刻就冲上前去。那个鞑靼男孩立刻丢掉手中的皮鞭拔腿就跑，躲过了狼狗的大嘴。但黑衣男人和小女孩就在大狗扑去的方向。狼狗已经被激怒，它根本不管周围的人是谁，一跃而起，扑向了离它最近的女孩，要不是约瑟夫在这个时候跳起来用力抓住了狼狗的项圈，女孩早已被扑倒了。

在乌克兰的时候，约瑟夫曾经多次和狗交过手，他知道，健康的、被善待的狗不会随意招惹人，所以他毫不畏惧，只是担心这条狼狗会把他当成是那个鞭打它的鞑靼男孩狠狠咬上一口。

约瑟夫紧紧抓住狼狗的项圈，然后像冲天火箭一样向狼狗猛扑过去，而这条狼狗此时正要往前跳，被这突如其来的重量一压，摔倒在地。女孩往后一躲，吓得哭了出来。约瑟夫死死抱住那条狼狗，翻滚到坚硬的路上，他尽力和狗交流并安抚它，但那条狗却越来越害怕。不过约瑟夫心里清楚，在他抓住项圈的那一刻，就有了胜算，至少他可以成功躲过狼狗的爪牙，所以，他抓住时机迅速松开了狼狗的项圈，爬起身来。那条狼狗也落得满身泥土，识趣地像一道闪电一样，朝着方济会教堂的方向跑掉了。

第三章　炼金术士


约瑟夫感到一股厚重且温柔的力量压在自己的肩膀上，同时还有某种东西轻柔地触碰着他的脸庞。

约瑟夫扫了一眼自己的衣服——比之前更破烂邋遢了，然后快速仰起头看去，发现肩头的力量来自那位黑衣男人的手，而那丝轻柔来自男人的同伴给他的一个吻——她的脸颊通红，眼睛明亮，双唇还贴在他的脸旁。刚才和狗猛地摔在地上，让他有些晕眩，但这友善的抚摸和亲吻让他的心里洋溢着兴奋和喜悦。

他后退一步，整理了一下自己的衣服，然后正视着眼前的男人和女孩。

眼神的交汇让他脸红起来。那男人的眼中充满感激，热泪盈眶，而女孩的眼里燃烧着坦率的敬仰之情。

“你的动作真快啊，”她兴奋地叫道，“我要是能像你那样跳跃该多好啊。你真勇敢——”

约瑟夫不知道说什么好，他才十五岁，即使是阅历丰富的成年人，面对如此诚恳的赞扬也会不知所措。

还没等约瑟夫开口答话，男人也赞叹道：“太棒了，太棒了！我从未见过如此敏捷的身手。”他说话的时候快速地眨着眼睛，好像是被光晃到了似的。

“这没什么，”约瑟夫结结巴巴地说道，“我在乌克兰经常把狗打跑。”感觉到自己的话可能有吹嘘之嫌，他又补充说，“在我们那儿像我这么大的男孩都是这样的。”

“你是从乌克兰来的？”黑衣男子好奇地问道，“那你怎么会大老远来这里呢？”

“不知道是鞑靼人，还是哥萨克人，烧毁了我家的房子，我们赶着马车，走了两个礼拜，才到了这里，却发现我们在这里也无依无靠。我父亲在这里有个亲戚，可是这个人已经死了，他的家人也都搬走了。”

“你的家人现在在哪里？”

“在市场上。”

“嗯，”男人喃喃道，“无家可归……在市场上……那你们有什么打算？”

约瑟夫摇了摇头，“我觉得父亲应该会给我们找个住处，”他终于说道，“他正考虑……”他犹豫了一下，父母从来不让他在陌生人面前谈论自家的困境，虽然眼前这位姑娘看他的眼神是那么温柔，那么甜美。

“这其中必定有蹊跷，”男人想道，“这个男孩很聪慧，他的谈吐表明他是一个受过良好教育的孩子。而且他的行为实在是很高尚——我完全相信刚才那畜生可能会一口咬到这孩子的喉咙。”

他低头看着约瑟夫，说道：“谢谢你刚才出手相助，多亏了你，我的侄女才没有受到伤害，你是否愿意到我们家，给我讲讲你的故事，或许我们可以……”

男孩的脸涨红了。“不，”他说，“我不想要什么回报，我做的……”

女孩打断了他，“你误解我叔叔了。他的意思是，我们家虽然有些寒酸，但你愿不愿意来休息一下，再和你的家人会合？”

“请原谅。”男孩立刻回答。

看着这两个孩子过于严肃的言辞和表达，男人大笑起来。虽然他知道，这个年龄的孩子往往会一夜之间就长大成人。在有些地方，十四五岁的女孩已经被视为成熟的女子，并可以谈婚论嫁；这个年龄的男孩子大多见过了人世沧桑，经历过战争和残酷的现实。

“我愿意和你们一起。”约瑟夫说道，之后他按照家教礼貌地在黑衣男子的袖口上亲吻了一下。

他们左拐经过方济会教堂，又向右穿过一条短巷，接着又左拐走进了那时候世界上最为神秘的街道。

这就是闻名欧洲的鸽子街，这里聚集着大量学者、天文学家、魔法师、学生，还有医生、教会兄弟以及那些精通七艺[1]的大师。街道最为破败的一头靠近北面的城墙，那里的房子肮脏污秽。犹太难民曾经为了逃避迫害，从世界各地来到这里聚居。这里一直都是贫穷的根据地，原来的犹太居民最终搬到了他们自己的城市，河那边的卡其米日市，而他们留下的房屋几乎不适合人居住。首先，它们年久失修，大部分都是木建筑，仅仅面朝街道的一面用砖头砌成，外面粗略地涂了一层水泥或是砂浆。楼房通常摇摇欲坠，房顶连瓦片也没有，只是用木板稀稀拉拉地固定着。楼房外面的楼梯东倒西歪，从街上或者院子里延伸到三四层的住处，住在那里的人家都贫困潦倒，几乎是人摞人地住在一起。

白天，盗贼和恶棍在那里藏身，目无法纪的人们出没在木屋、阁楼或者地窖里。一四零七年的一场大火蔓延了整条街道，一直烧到圣安巷，烧掉了许多不堪入目的地方，可惜没有烧干净。

鸽子街的南端面对着克拉科夫大学，那里就体面多了，因为学生和大学的老师们居住在那里。一座巨大的学生宿舍坐落在亚盖洛大街和鸽子街交汇的拐角处，许多学生都住在那里，还有一些学生居住在外面，也有的寄住在平民人家。因为直到十五世纪九十年代，校方才规定学生必须在校内居住。

各个学院的声誉以及学校教师的威望不仅吸引了大量聪颖的学生，而且吸引了形形色色的江湖术士——占卜师、占星师、魔法师、手相师、江湖郎中、巫师，还有一些总能逍遥法外的骗子。他们都在鸽子街找到了自己的一席之地。

这些人的踪影无处不在，街上的房间里、地下室的厨房里，到处都是他们交易的场所。占星师通过描述星星的位置变化，为轻易上当的人解读他们的命运。要是农家少女请他们预测自己的姻缘，他们就取悦她们，说她们要交桃花运了；商人上门的时候，他们总是哄骗他们说将有灾难来临，引诱商人出更多的钱来破财免灾。他们欺诈抢劫，被激怒时甚至会杀人，几年后，他们就臭名昭著了。多年后，当约瑟夫·恰尔涅茨基成为一名年迈老者的时候，克拉科夫大学才揭穿了这些人的阴谋诡计，一个名叫尼古拉斯·哥白尼的人揭穿了这些骗术和上不了台面的伎俩。在望远镜被发明之前，哥白尼用简陋的工具第一次向人们证明了天体、恒星和行星在宇宙中是按照固定规律运行的，而且它们的运动从宇宙初期就没有变过，与人们的命运更是没有任何关系。

他们周围的人都像小女孩的监护人一样穿着长袍，不过样式不太一样。其中有神职人员，他们紧系着前襟和领子，也有人穿着袖口宽大的袍子，像是大主教穿的法衣一样前襟敞口，随风飘荡，有些袍子是蓝色的，有些是红色的，还有些是绿色的。约瑟夫还看到一个人穿着貂皮的袍子，袍子上挂着一条金链子，下端吊着一个巨大的紫水晶十字架。

他们路过一间木石混合结构的房子时，一大群年轻人正聚集在那里，他们也身穿朴素黑袍，但远不如之前路上的人们穿的华丽。这些人正在进行一场激烈的辩论，黑衣男人告诉两个孩子，他们在讨论星星的运动。其中一人说星空一百年来一直在向西移动，另一个人说星星自古以来都朝着同一个方向运动（这个说法源于西班牙古老的《阿方索星表》[2]）。

这之后，他们来到一座正面由石头砌成的房子前面，房子的大门内缩，两侧由突出的低矮建筑支撑，似乎是为了提醒住户在继续前行之前先仔细瞧瞧左右两侧——这个提醒在晚上尤其有必要。上方的窗户不仅装有木遮板，可以像门一样开合，还安装着铁护栏。黑衣男人从袍子里取出一把巨大的铜钥匙，插到门锁中，用力一拧，大门打开。

他们跨过低矮的木门槛，穿过一条黑暗的通道，进入了开放的庭院。庭院的后面就是修道院平坦的外墙，上面没有门窗。庭院的右侧是一座低矮的平房，左边是一座摇摇晃晃的木结构建筑，总共有四层。楼外面，有一道由木桩子支撑的靠着墙的楼梯，通往二层和三层。院子中间有一口老井，井口的轱辘上缠着绳子，上面还挂着一只木桶。

他们登上楼梯，脚下发出吱吱呀呀的声响，约瑟夫甚至感到了轻微的晃动。他感觉一阵晕眩，然后紧紧扶住了墙，担心楼梯会突然松动，轰然倒塌。看到约瑟夫这突然之举，男人笑着让他放心，这楼梯绝对安全。他们经过二楼，爬上三楼，然后男人从长袍里又掏出另一把钥匙，这把比刚才那把小了一些。

正当他们要进入三楼房间的时候，约瑟夫注意到再往上还有一层，但是上楼的主楼梯到三层就没有了。看上去那上面应该是一间阁楼或者储藏室，要想上去需要爬上一段简陋的楼梯，那里只有一侧扶手，倾斜着固定在墙上。木梯的尽头就是顶楼的门，令约瑟夫吃惊的是，那居然是一面金属房门。从这扇门的大小和形状看来，这应该是由窗户改造的，因为门右面的墙上还被凿出一个方孔，大概是透光用的。约瑟夫感觉这个阁楼有着难以捉摸的神秘，但他们随即走进了男人和小女孩居住的屋子，他的疑惑也暂时搁置。

眼前的房间闷热昏暗，但摆放的家具却很讲究。墙上挂着绣帷，地上摆着大橡木椅子，房子正中间是一张圆桌，还有几只大箱子，墙边的餐具柜上还摆着闪闪发光的银器。

小女孩一进屋就迅速跑到窗边，打开了窗户，光线随即透过众多小小的玻璃窗格照射进来。她很快又拿来两只小高脚杯，斟满酒放在了约瑟夫和黑衣男子的面前，桌上还有几块碎面包。他们坐在桌旁，吃了起来。约瑟夫虽然尽力掩饰自己的饥饿，但依旧吃得狼吞虎咽。

“现在给我们讲讲你的故事吧。”男人对约瑟夫说道。

约瑟夫简短地讲述了自己的经历，重点说了他们一家人到达克拉科夫那天早上发生的事情，以及他们所面临的尴尬处境。

男人专心地听着，约瑟夫话音刚落，他就轻击了一下桌子，说道：“我有主意了，你在这儿等我一下，也可以休息一会儿，我去去就回。”随即走出门去，匆匆下楼，去了二层的一个房间。

女孩把自己的椅子拉到约瑟夫的旁边，抬头看着约瑟夫的眼睛。

“你叫什么名字？”她问道。

“我叫约瑟夫·恰尔涅茨基。”

“约瑟夫，”女孩说，“我非常喜欢你的名字。我叫埃尔兹别塔。”

“我父亲是安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基，”约瑟夫继续说道，“我们本来住在乌克兰的乡下，那里的土地都是黑色的。我们没有邻居，离我们最近的邻居也有六十英里远呢。不过，我们并不像其他人那样怕哥萨克人和鞑靼人，因为我父亲对他们很好。不久前，我家以前的一个仆人，他是一个善良的鞑靼人，他来我家告诉我们将有危险，我们都很吃惊。我父亲当时哈哈大笑，但我知道他一定很重视这个消息，因为他把那个鞑靼人带到一旁，私下聊了很长时间。不过，我父亲从来不把恐惧表现出来，我们和往常一样生活，我母亲和我很快就把那个警告给忘得一干二净。

“有一天睡觉前，我母亲正在缝补衣服，她看到一个男人正从我们房子角落的茅草堆往屋里偷看。我母亲从没见过那个人，他既不是我们的家仆，也不是附近人家的人。他有一张邪恶的脸，把我母亲吓得尖叫了一声，我们全都吓了一跳。”

“啊？”埃尔兹别塔的蓝眼睛里充满了好奇。

“那天夜里，我父亲来到我的房间，把我叫醒，让我赶快穿好衣服，接着就把我和我母亲带到了房子后面的一扇小门前面，这扇小门一直都用木条钉死，那是我第一次见那扇门打开。出了门我们就进入了一条像山洞一样的地道，我们顺着地道一直往前爬，最后来到了一个独立的小棚子，我们家的两匹快马套着一辆马车在那里拴着。原来，在我们毫不知情的情况下，我父亲已经做好了准备。这件事让我确定父亲有所担心，而他瞒着我们的事情一定很危险。”

“那你现在知道了吗？”

“没有，最奇怪的事情我还没说。我和我母亲爬上马车，车上已经备好了充足的食物，而我父亲快速走到棚子的角落，用力挥起耙子开始刨东西，不一会儿，他就从用来覆盖保护的树叶和树枝下面挖出了一堆蔬菜。我以为他要放些蔬菜到车里作为食物，但令我吃惊的是，他只选了一样东西。”

“那是？”

“一个南瓜。”

“一个南瓜！为什么啊？”

“我也不知道。当我们把马车上的食物吃光之后，父亲也不让我们动那个南瓜——不过，这已经是十天后的事情了，那时候我们已经快到城里了。对了，今天早上，一个男人好像从乌克兰一直跟踪我们到这里，他提出要用和那个南瓜一样重的金子来交换那个南瓜，但被我父亲拒绝了。”

“你后来知道你母亲在茅草堆看到的那个人是谁了吗？”

“不知道，但是后来发生的事情证明父亲秘密地带我们匆忙逃离村庄是明智的。因为我们离开家几天后，在一个村庄歇脚时，碰到了一个从我们那里骑马而来的老乡。他在我们离开那天路过了我们家。他告诉我们，我们的房子全都被烧毁了，田地也好像是大战后的战场，麦苗都倒下了，庄稼也被烧毁了，地上到处都是坑，好像有人要寻找藏起来的宝贝。”

“那个南瓜现在还在你父亲手里吗？”

“嗯，我父亲一直带着那个南瓜——虽然我不明白他为什么会为了这个南瓜而拒绝接受同等重量的金子。不过，他要是知道我和别人说了这么多，他应该会不高兴，虽然我相信你会替我保密的。好了，给我讲讲你的事情吧。那个你叫叔叔的人，他是你父亲的兄弟吗？”

“是的。我父母在我小时候感染了瘟疫病死了。我叔叔在大学里做研究，是个非常优秀的学者，”埃尔兹别塔骄傲地说道，“他叫尼古拉斯·克鲁兹，是大学里最有名的炼金术士。他也是个虔诚的基督教徒，不过并不是教堂的神职人员，他现在一心钻研炼金术。”

正说着，这位学者兼炼金术士就出现在了门口，微笑着看着他们。

“我已经确认过了，”他一边说一边在桌子旁坐了下来，“如果你父亲不嫌弃，这里就是你们的安身之处。房租也不贵，只是有些简陋，但也总比天黑之后露宿街头要强。不过，你父亲可能得把马卖了——这时候应该能卖个好价钱——而且你们可以一直住到他找到合适的差事为止。除非，”他补充说道，“他觉得这里太过寒酸。”

“怎么会呢？”约瑟夫急切地说道，“为了我母亲，他现在住哪儿都高兴。从乌克兰到这里一路奔波，我母亲已经疲惫不堪了。我巴不得马上就告诉他这个消息，但您得保证您说的是真的。”

埃尔兹别塔从椅子上跳了起来，说道：“你要是像我一样了解我叔叔，就不会怀疑了。”

炼金术士用长长的手臂搂住乖巧的侄女，长袍的衣袖顺势垂下，女孩好像是被一只巨大的乌鸦围在怀里一样，在叔叔的怀抱中对约瑟夫笑了。

“快去告诉你家人吧，”埃尔兹别塔催促着约瑟夫，“把他们带到这里，其实我都不知道有母亲是什么感觉。要是她能喜欢我——”

“一定会的，”约瑟夫喊道，“我马上就回去，不过还得克鲁兹先生帮我打开下面的大门。”

“告诉你父母我们楼下那层没人住，”送约瑟夫出门的时候，炼金术士嘱咐道，“那里有两个房间，一大一小，不过我想，应该暂时够你们住了。”

约瑟夫真诚地谢过炼金术士，转身就向市场跑去。他一路奔跑，鸽子街也好像在他面前渐渐铺开，很快他就跑到了直接通向老布楼的那条街。

转过路口，经过市政大楼，跑过布料市场，约瑟夫径直跑向他父亲饮马的小教堂附近。看到父亲和母亲正站在车上，他突然惊讶地停下了脚步。眼前的一切让他的心跳突然加速，跳得比最近任何时候都要快，他就像离弦的箭一般冲上前去。

那个早上被他们摔在路边泥坑里的陌生人，正带着一群暴徒站在他们的马车旁边，厉声地恐吓着安德鲁先生和他的妻子。陌生人的手里拿着大木棍，他带领的那群暴徒手里拿着木棍和石头，蛮横地冲着约瑟夫的父母嚷嚷着，好像要随时发起攻击。安德鲁先生直面着这些恶棍，挺身站在妻子的前面，以免她被飞来的石头打中。安德鲁的抵抗以及这群恶棍的叫嚷声不一会儿就引来大批人的围观。这时候即将正午，上午的集市差不多都结束了，很多市民和农夫正坐在广场周围的树荫下吃饭歇息。

约瑟夫冲过人群，嗖地跳上马车，站在父亲的旁边。

“好啊，小崽子也回来了，”那个早晨自称奥斯特洛夫斯基的人喊道，“他和他父亲一样，是个巫师，还继承了他母亲的妖惑之术。今天早上，就是他在我的马的侧身上一击，就把我的马打到了天上。”

这时，人群中一阵骚动，飞出一块石头，差点砸到安德鲁。

“巫师！巫婆！”这群人大声叫嚣着。

“这个男人更是十恶不赦，”自称奥斯特洛夫斯基的人喊道，“就是他蛊惑了我的哥哥，把我哥哥的头割下来，变成了南瓜。他要是还有点良心，就在众目睽睽下把那个南瓜还给我，我要给我哥哥的脑袋一个体面的基督教葬礼……哎，他不会给我的，就让他接受我的指控吧，他是个巫师，这是肯定的，他必须受到教堂、法庭和律法的惩罚。上啊！杀了他！把南瓜还给我，那可是我哥哥的头啊！”

虽然他的这些控诉在今天看来着实荒唐可笑，但十五世纪的人们可不这么认为。那时候，仅有少数的智者才能看穿那些在黑暗时期广为流行的迷信和残忍的闹剧，大多数人都相信有人拥有可怕的力量，能够将别人变成怪物，他们相信有人可以通过邪恶的方式来对付他人，他们甚至相信略施魔法，食物就会有毒，牛奶就会变质。

而某个人一旦被盖上巫师的帽子，那么不论他是多么和善无辜，也会遭到粗暴愚昧的人们的迫害和不公对待。

这个陌生人正是要利用这点来报复安德鲁先生，不过除了报仇，他更渴望得到那个安德鲁拒绝交出的南瓜。他一直在城里纠集朋友和帮手，放出巫师的谣言，并全城搜查，终于碰上了安德鲁先生和他的妻子。

“南瓜！那个南瓜，那是我哥哥的头！”他不停地喊叫着。

安德鲁只是微笑地看着他，满脸鄙夷。他紧紧守护着南瓜，手里挥舞着重剑不让人靠近，而那些进攻者都是些懦夫，谁也不敢从安德鲁先生的正面方向接近马车。有些人手里拿着大石头，偷偷绕到马车的后面，另一些人站在马车前面，准备投射武器。正在此时，喧嚣的人群中突然冲出一个人。他器宇轩昂，身着袖子宽松并带有尖帽的棕色袍子，中等身材，步履坚定，风华正茂。

他可能是一位牧师，看上去像个颇有权威的修士，但他肯定是位学者，因为他从头到脚都像一位有学问的人。

“停下！都住手！”他用命令的口气喊道，“你们在干什么？”

“这个男人，这个女人，还有这个小孩都会巫术，他们是巫师、巫婆，”带头的那个人粗声粗气地说道，“你别插手，我们正在教训他们。”

“巫师、巫婆？胡说！”新来的人说道，然后走向马车，站到安德鲁先生的旁边，“这只不过是你们行凶的借口罢了，过去的一年中，我在这城里已经见过太多这种伎俩了。除了瞎子，谁都能看得出这是一位老实人，你们竟然欺负这么一个人，还有柔弱的女人和手无寸铁的孩子？你们真是一群懦夫！赶紧散了，不然我就把国王的卫队叫来。”

“这是扬·康迪！”一个暴徒认出了这个人，大声又怯怯地说道，“我不干了！”然后就扔掉手里的木棒，灰溜溜地逃走了。

安德鲁一家不会什么魔法，但扬·康迪的名字肯定有魔法，而且是一种非常强大的魔法，因为所有人在听了扬·康迪的名字后都崇敬地脱下了帽子，人们斜眼看着彼此，好像是做了见不得人的事情被抓了。

“善良的扬·康迪。”四周围的人们都悄声议论着，转瞬间人群就散去了，甚至连那个带头闹事的人也不见了踪影。

第四章　善良的扬·康迪


十五世纪的克拉科夫正处于辉煌时期，不乏赫赫有名之人，学者兼修士扬·康迪就是其中之一。他毕业于克拉科夫大学，那时经院哲学虽已开始衰落，但学校教授的主要内容还是以语法为主的七艺。扬·康迪并不拘泥于学校，他常常与各种人接触，是个多才多艺的人。他做学问完全没有功利之心，而且崇尚真理和生活实践。他全身心投在位于大学老楼（如今早已毁于大火之中）底层的小宿舍中，给一些老学科注入新思想，评论欧洲伟大的教会中心的大学学者和博士们的观点和作为，并编写他所在时代的历史。

他高尚慈爱，那时他的住所门庭若市，拜访者就如今天来瞻仰他在老大学图书馆的圣像的人一样络绎不绝。农民们对他尤为敬重，这其实相当反常，因为田里的庄稼人很少会找大学的学士来问询意见，事实上，他们是羞于接受学问深厚的人的帮助。然而，他们在扬·康迪面前则不会感到害羞。在谷物和蔬菜播种的季节，他们来到克拉科夫向扬·康迪咨询气候情况；当和地主之间出现纠纷的时候，他们找他出主意；他们向他咨询牲畜的饲料问题和各种与宗教信仰有关的问题。他的回答总能让他们满意，他们也将他的建议奉为上天的旨意。

因此，他的名字人尽皆知，传遍乡野。他憎恶一切人类的暴行，尤其痛恨欺凌弱小之事，无论是一匹马，一条狗，或是一个孩子，都能引起他同情。所以，当他看到一家看上去很老实的人被近百人骚扰的时候，就毫不犹豫、奋不顾身地冲进了乱石之中。

“愿主赐予你平安，”人群散去后，他对安德鲁先生说，“还有你，亲爱的。”他将手放在安德鲁妻子的头上，“你们怎么会遭此劫难呢？你们是从外地来的？”

“对，外地人，更糟的是，我们还无家可归。”安德鲁先生回答。

“你们从很远的地方来？”

“我们来自乌克兰。”

这位好心人有些惊讶，“哎呀，那你们在这里有亲友吧？”

“一个也没有。我本来有个亲戚，也找过他，可是他已经死了。我的房子被鞑靼人烧毁了，如今一贫如洗，还有人一路跟踪，想要把我除掉，抢走我仅有的财产。”说到此处时，他用脚碰了下南瓜。

“但那些人为什么说你会巫术呢？”

安德鲁先生笑了笑，“这只不过是他们煽动众人强取豪夺的把戏罢了。我觉得那个煽风挑事的人已经一路跟踪了我很久，跟着我跨过了国境线，而且他一定是某个更有权威人的手下。说来话长啊……好心的……好心的……您是神父吗？”

“人们是这么叫我的，但我只不过是上帝的仆人罢了。”

“那么，好心的神父，请您听我说。我一心向善，可我在这个充满阴谋和困扰的世界无依无靠，我只想给我的妻子和孩子找一个能遮风挡雨的地方，先度过今夜再说。”

“那就跟我来吧，”这位学者兼神父说道，“至少你们可以来我的宿舍做客……看，把你的马车套好，穿过那条巷子就是圣安街。”

安德鲁先生已经开始调整马具了，一旁的约瑟夫拽了拽他的袖子，“父亲，”他急切地说道，“父亲，我知道一个可以住的地方。”

安德鲁低下头看着约瑟夫，满脸惊讶。“你？”他问道，“你是怎么找到的？”

“一位学者和他的侄女住在那里。他们还邀请我去了他们家。他们楼下正好有间空房，就在楼梯口。”

扬·康迪打断了他们的话，“无论如何，先去我的住所吧，我们可以商量一下之后的打算。如果这孩子真的找到了住处——我看他表情认真，话好像是真的——咱们就可以到我那里好好谈谈，毕竟在这闹市没办法安心交谈。”

几分钟以后，他们就来到了大学里最大的一栋楼前面。一路上，约瑟夫注意到几乎他们在街上遇到的每个人见到扬·康迪时都会脱帽致意，甚至还有一队骑士拔出佩剑向他敬礼。不过，扬·康迪似乎并没太注意这些，因为他正一门心思地考虑着眼前的问题。当他从马车上下来，把一家人带到他宿舍门口时，他还在沉思中。

一进到屋里，安德鲁先生就暂时把约瑟夫带回的消息搁置一旁，请求和扬·康迪单独交谈。扬·康迪在他宿舍外过道的桌子上摆了一些食物，男孩和他母亲就在外面吃东西。而安德鲁就在里面和扬·康迪悄声地谈话。

约瑟夫和他母亲吃东西的时候只能听到里面嗡嗡的谈话声。他只有一次听清楚了几个字，那是神父问安德鲁先生：“那么，就是你从乌克兰带来的那个南瓜吗？”

安德鲁肯定是点头示意了一下，因为在外面听不到任何言语上的回答。在谈话过程中，他的手里一直抱着那个南瓜。约瑟夫开始和他母亲讲述自己所经历的事情，没有再听里面的谈话。

他讲着讲着，他母亲停止了进餐，注视着他，说：“天啊，这简直是个奇迹，等你父亲和好心的神父谈完了，我们就直接去那个学者所说的地方……那个可怜的孩子，她的父母死于瘟疫？不过，我觉得一定是上帝把我们送到她身边来的。”

扬·康迪坐在房间的里侧，从头到尾听完了安德鲁先生的故事，又提了几个问题，安德鲁回答之后，两人又开始低声地交流起来。

之后，扬·康迪把一只手挡在眼前，好像陷入了深思，然后说道：“我感觉你的面前有一条很明确的路。既然你在城里有宿敌，就一定要暂时躲起来。我建议你更名改姓，这也不是什么罪过，因为你这么做的目的是堂堂正正的。眼下，你可以把马和车卖了换些钱，瓦维尔山下的平原上有一个马匹市场，如果你愿意，我可以派人帮你去处理。目前马只是你的累赘，不过它们品种好，喂养得也好，肯定能卖个好价钱。”

“即使卖了马，钱也维持不了多久，”安德鲁说道，“我还得再找份工作。”

“我已经想过了，”扬·康迪继续说，“我正好知道有个工作很适合你，不过有些卑微。”

“对我来说，没有卑微可言，”安德鲁马上回答道，“只要够我的妻子和儿子生活就行了。”

“好！太好了！”扬·康迪高兴地说道，“那我手头这事情就正好合适。我想你以前做过狩猎人吧？”

“对，您为什么这么问呢？”安德鲁诧异道。

“那您会吹号吗？”

“当然，可以不夸张地说，我吹得比东征军队中任何狩猎人都好。”

“好！不过还有一件事……刚才你和我说的话只能转达给国王。你所守护的宝物应该归还给他，那是国家的财产。我不知道它已经造成了怎样的危害，只希望一切危害到此为止。你是否愿意把它交给我来保管？”

“我很愿意交给您，可是我向我父亲发过誓，只要我活着，就要和它寸步不离——除非是把它献给波兰国王。”

“上帝保佑。在马卖出之前你们就在这里休息吧，我再听听你儿子的故事，然后我们再考虑今后的事情。”

接着，他就把门外的母子叫进屋里。“天啊，这，”在安德鲁太太复述了约瑟夫的经历之后，扬·康迪说道，“这简直是完美的安排。我知道你说的地方，我也认识克鲁兹，他很爱钻研，性情有些古怪，但人很诚实可靠，爱追求真知。许多普通人都害怕他，一些住在邻街的人也不敢靠近他，那条街在很久以前就住着巫师，而他家的院子更是少有人往来。有时会有一些关于他的奇怪传闻，不过我知道其中大多都是讹传。但那里是你们目前所需要的安身之处，你们在那里应该没人打扰。”

安德鲁太太此时心头涌上一股感激之情，她几乎要跪到地上请求神父的福佑了，但被神父拦住了。

“不，孩子，”扬·康迪说道，“是我需要你们的福佑，因为你们心地善良、坚毅勇敢。”

女人亲吻了扬·康迪的双手，随即，约瑟夫也学着母亲的样子，向神父行了吻手礼。安德鲁先生的眼眶已经湿润，他迅速背过身去，不愿让人看见，他的心中感受到强烈的善的力量，触碰着人类情感的源泉。这位神父身上的某种气质直击他的心灵，这种情感和精神上的气质是如此的美好温柔，与众不同。

扬·康迪派了大学里的一个仆役去卖马和车，约瑟夫和父母坐在那里等消息。

这时候，响起一阵敲门声。扬·康迪立即起身开门。只见一个女人抱着一个婴儿站在门口，看样子不是来乞讨救济，而是要寻求建议。她说她从黑村赶来，双腿、双臂和脖子都特别疼。

扬·康迪轻声问她：“你睡在哪里？”

“我睡在地上，尊敬的先生，”她回答说，“实在是太疼了，我快忍受不了了。肯定是魔鬼在折磨我，我想请您帮我把它驱走。”

“你们睡的是石头地板吗？”

“是的。”

“石板是不是经常很潮湿？”

“不是的，尊敬的先生，只有春天是这样。”

“那石板下的地面是潮湿的吗？”

“哦，是的，也许吧，”她说道，“有时不常打井水的时候，地板就会溢水，因为那里有一处水源，取水的时候如果不小心，水也会溢出来。”

“好的，那按我的话做，疼痛就会消失了。在水井和你们住的房子之间用石头垒一堵矮墙，要能够防水，然后再挖一条排水道，把水引走。还要经常晒床单并保持干燥，每周在睡觉的地方换上干树枝，这样你的疼痛就会消失了。”

女人感激地亲吻了他的手，然后就离开了。

过了不久，又来了一个农民，他抱怨说田里有很多虫子，毁了庄稼的幼苗。

“神父，您能祷告一下，”他请求道，“让虫子消失吗？”

“只有你才能防止虫害，”扬·康迪说，“你从炉子上抠一些灰下来，把它们撒在秧苗的周围。如果这么做没效果的话，早晨早起去给秧苗周围浇上水，这样虫子就会爬出来，你就可以杀死害虫了。”

农民走后，扬·康迪开始伏案工作，在一长卷羊皮纸上写着什么，纸卷的一头几乎快要拖到地上了。他书写用的笔是一支插在橡木上的鸽毛笔。

约瑟夫蜷缩在窗户下方的长凳上，闭着眼睛。今天经历了好多事啊！未来又将是什么样的呢？

他的思绪起初缓慢，然后突然就变得轻快，开始天马行空。他似乎看到自己身穿铠甲，一手拿着盾牌，一手挥舞着长剑，正在和一个魁梧的鞑靼人拼死搏斗，而这个鞑靼人长了一颗巨大的黄色南瓜头。鞑靼人突然取下那颗南瓜头，抱着它爬上了一个陡峭的梯子，进了一间悬挂在星星上的房间。房间里闪烁着奇怪的光焰，突然鞑靼人又出现了，这次顶着一颗狗头，那个南瓜飘浮在他的身边，像是一个羽毛做成的球，在风中飘动着。约瑟夫听到扬·康迪手中的鹅毛笔和纸张的摩挲声响越来越微弱，渐渐和他脑中的奇幻世界一同陷入了黑暗之中。

很快，他就睡着了。

当他醒来的时候，房间里已经没有了阳光。房间里侧点起了一盏烛灯，借着烛光他看到扬·康迪和他的父母正围着桌上放的什么东西。他揉了揉眼睛，确定自己已经醒来。他定睛一看——桌上放的正是那个神秘的南瓜，他的父亲正在用一把大刀切削南瓜的外皮。这个南瓜很特别，它的外皮硬而脆，刀子就像是在切削木板一样。约瑟夫被这个过程迷住了，几乎不敢呼吸。随着刀刃在南瓜的外壳上慢慢移动，硬壳的碎屑也一点点掉到地上。

“我认为，”安德鲁低声说道，“我手里的这个东西就是我在乌克兰的房子受到攻击的原因，而今天骚扰我们的那个人对南瓜壳里的东西一清二楚。有人告诉他这个东西在我手里，他清楚我的底细，所以当他看到我的车上只有这一个南瓜的时候，心里就有数了。不过，为了尽量减少人们的怀疑，我也没有极力掩饰。”

“但是，”扬·康迪打断他，“只要稍加思考，人们就会觉得蹊跷。这个南瓜已经成熟了，我想在这仲夏时节整个波兰也很难找到这么一个南瓜。”

“是啊，”安德鲁回答道，“但我只能冒险。很久之前，我一直担心这件宝物，害怕坏人发现它的存在而出来抢夺，后来我就想到了这个主意，用这样一个外壳来把它藏起来。从那以后，不论冬夏，我都会准备好一个南瓜壳，其实，在这之前，我做过很多实验，但都没有这个效果好。”

此时，他切掉了南瓜的最后一片外壳。

房间突然像是被上千支蜡烛照亮了一般，斑斓的色彩照射在墙上——刚刚放置南瓜的地方形成了巨大的光源，像是天上的太阳一般。舞动的光芒闪烁摇曳，将阴暗的屋子一下子照得和白天一样明亮——紧接着就又只剩下烛灯的光亮了，因为安德鲁已经把原本装在南瓜里的东西放进了扬·康迪准备的袋子里，约瑟夫冲到桌子前面的时候，他正忙着系上口袋。

“父亲，”他叫道，“这是什么？你从南瓜里拿出的东西怎么会发光？”

安德鲁的声音坚定而温柔，“约瑟夫，到时候你就知道了。如果你知道了我们所承担的责任，对你来说只是负担，会带给你想象不到的压力。如果你只是好奇，那知道了还不如不知道，因为它只会给你带来痛苦。如果真是出于兴趣，那我一定会在合适的时候把事情的来龙去脉都告诉你。现在——我已经为此付出太多了，不想让你年纪轻轻就承受这个秘密带来的巨大负担。”

安德鲁停顿了一下，沉默了一阵之后，转移了话题。

“我们现在就出发，去你为我们找的地方。你睡觉的时候，我和尊敬的神父已经见过了你的朋友们。他已经帮我们安顿好了，那屋子布置得很舒服，在今后的一段时间，我们就住在那里了。”





第五章　鸽子街


安德鲁一家人从扬·康迪的住处出来时，圣安街已经漆黑一片。扬·康迪坚持要陪他们一起，他走在最前面，手里拿着他的小烛灯引路。烛灯发出的微弱灯光只能照出脚下一两步以内的地方，天上没有月亮，只有点点星光，和烛灯的光亮一样昏暗。安德鲁右手牵着他的妻子，紧跟在扬·康迪身后，约瑟夫跟在最后。一行人走在路边的狭窄步道上，刚走几步约瑟夫就感觉有一个湿乎乎的东西凑到了自己的右手上，他吓得跳了起来，但很快他就安心下来，原来是一只流浪狗把鼻子凑到他手里，以示友好。

约瑟夫弯下身来，摸到一个蓬松的大脑袋，心想，“这只狗长得好像今天扑向埃尔兹别塔的那条狼狗。是的——大小差不多——而且，这个项圈和我抓住的那个简直一模一样。摸摸项圈上面的小突起就知道了，它们几乎可以划破手指。”

“父亲！父亲！”他叫道。

安德鲁迅速转过身，“怎么了？”

“有一只狗，”约瑟夫回答道，“特别友好的狗。”

“把它也带着吧，”安德鲁笑着说，“我们现在朋友越多越好。”说完，他们就继续往前走。

在上帝创造的所有生物中，狗是最神奇的，而且有些时候，某些人可能会认为它是最有识别力的。这只狗早上挣脱束缚之后，遵循了自己的最初冲动，就是干了一架。它的第二想法就是找个朋友，因为每只狗都需要朋友。那个鞑靼男孩已经离开了，而且它已经看清了那个男孩的面目。狗拥有一种与生俱来的罕见能力——有时候马也有——意识到那个跳过来抓住自己项圈的男孩并没有敌意。或许是那个男孩的触摸，也许是男孩说话的语调，让这个动物意识到男孩经常和狗打交道，也会很友善地对待它。所以它在街上寻找了一整天，当它在黑暗中遇到这一家人的时候，它闻到了爱狗人的味道，更巧的是，这个人竟然还是早上突然跳到它身上的那个男孩。

他们转过圣安街，走进了一条如今被称为亚盖洛斯卡街的小巷，顺着这条路走一会儿就到了鸽子街。他们在那里左拐，还没走几步就听到前面乱哄哄的声音。扬·康迪神父停住了脚步，其他人也停了下来，一动不动，只有那只狗还在往前凑，约瑟夫一下拽住了它的项圈。

“你们在这里等一下，”神父说道，“我过去看看发生了什么事。”前面有一群身穿黑袍的人在大街正中央围了一圈。扬·康迪把烛灯举过头顶，挤进了人群之中。

“学生们！”他大声叫道，举着烛灯一一照过这些学生的脸，“学生们，你们在这里搞什么鬼？”

他一来人们就让开了路，安德鲁先生能够看出，这也许是出于害怕，也许是出于敬重，也许两者都有。

“在决斗？”扬·康迪走到人群中央，原本被看热闹的人遮住的地面被烛灯照亮了，他大声问道，“发生了什么事？”

两个年轻人，都是学生，面对面地站着，衣衫敞开，学校的黑袍扔在地上。他们右臂的衣袖都撸了起来，手里紧握着纤细的意大利长剑。就在扬·康迪进入这个小战场之前，他们刚刚进行了交锋。

“决斗，”扬·康迪再次说道，“你们难道不知道禁止在学校周围的街道上决斗吗？我都不知道这戒令下了多少次了！你们难道不知道学生决斗将会被罚款或者监禁吗？”

他毫不畏惧地伸手去夺他们手中的剑。“这不是闹着玩的。”他一边呵斥，一边把两人拉到一起。

这确实不是玩笑！这两个年轻人都用的是裸剑！大多数学生在决斗的时候都会将剑头包住，以降低危险，要么就是用宽剑，而决斗双方也会穿上护甲，戴上厚重的护臂和头盔。然而，这两个年轻人却没有做任何的防护，很明显，如果没有扬·康迪的阻止，其中一个人一定会受重伤。

“发生了什么？”他又问道，“你们叫什么名字？”他把烛灯凑到离自己较近的学生脸边，惊讶地喊道，“约翰·特林！我怎么也想不到会在这里看到你！即便看到大主教，我也不会这么吃惊！我以为你会谨遵上帝旨意，而不是诉诸武力。你叫什么名字？”他又厉声问另一个学生。

“康拉德·米林纳基，来自马佐维亚。”这个学生一面说着，一面将武器插回了腰际，羞愧地垂下了眼睛。

“马佐维亚人！我很高兴你还知道羞愧，我大概可以猜到你愤怒的原因，我听说最近马佐维亚人总被无端侮辱。回你的房间去吧，我明天再听你的故事。还有你们，”他转向人群，大部分人已经走了，但还有一些幸灾乐祸的人，等着看热闹，“都用你们最快的速度回自己的宿舍去，如果我回来的时候还看见你们在这里的话，我明天早上就通报给学校。”

“而你，约翰·特林，”人群散尽之后，他和另外一个学生说道，“难道你就不会因为在公众场合闹事感到羞耻吗？”

“不。”这个学生不假思索地回答道，并不在意扬·康迪质问的眼光。

这时候安德鲁先生一家也赶了上来。在灯光的照耀下，约瑟夫看到了那个名叫约翰·特林的学生的脸，不由得大吃一惊——心头涌起一股强烈的反感。倒不是因为看到了一张扭曲的脸，这张脸并不难看，眼睛明亮有神，还有一头黑发——这个人身材挺拔，领口露出的皮肤和他的头发以及身后的黑暗形成了强烈的反差。但是，他的鼻子细长而透着刻薄，他的嘴巴小而含着傲慢，目光中显露着极度自私的神气。对于入世未深的年轻人来说，这种表情特别奇怪，甚至有些怪异；对于他们来说，这种表情很不自然，而这种做作对约瑟夫这个年纪的男孩来说更为明显，而那些见惯了这种自私和刻薄的长者和成年人则不会那么留心。

“你们打架的原因是什么？”约瑟夫听到神父非常严厉地询问。

“一句话也说不清楚。”

“那就长话短说。”

“他侮辱了我。”

“他说什么？”

“说了很多，主要是嘲笑我的研究。他问我是不是掌握了用破铜烂铁和皮革炼金的方法，他还说要把全城的烂鞋都找来，让我把它们变成贵重的金属。”

“之前你没挑衅他吗？”

特林犹豫了下，但扬·康迪有一种叫人实话实说的威慑力。“我问他是不是北方国家的青蛙也会说马佐维亚语。”他回答道，话音里有些酸涩。

“我猜就是这一回事，”扬·康迪打断了对方的话，“人们为什么总要挑衅这些马佐维亚人，非得逼他们动武呢？我在此告诫你，你可能是个剑客，不过，马佐维亚人虽然讷于言，但个个精通剑术。”

“但他也出言不逊。”特林继续为自己辩解道，由于无法用波兰语清楚地表达自己的感受，他又说起了德语，这让约瑟夫颇为苦恼，因为他一句也听不懂。

“当心一些，特林，”神父语重心长地说道，“你并不是大学常规录取的学生，所以必须更加小心行事……既然是你先动武，你就要主动讲和，明天破晓就去找你的对手赔礼，亲吻他的脸颊，然后请求他的原谅。”

特林对这个建议并不满意，但他深深地被扬·康迪所影响，最终点头同意。

“除此之外，我还要多说两句，约翰·特林，这种事情对你没有任何好处。我不太清楚你最近在研究什么，但听说你经常和一些无所作为的巫师和占星师混在一起，而很少请教克鲁兹先生那样高尚的人。如今世道黑暗，人们总是以怀疑的目光看待那些做研究的人们，不论他们的研究是否可靠，是否神圣。另外，你还住在克鲁兹那里吗？”

“是的。”

“那就和我们一起吧，我们也要去那里。这位先生和他的妻子将会租住在克鲁兹的楼下。”

这位年轻人试图在黑暗中借着烛灯打量一下这些新房客，但什么也看不清楚。

一行人继续朝前走了一小段路，就到了约瑟夫下午来过的地方的门口。扬·康迪伸手拉动了一下从大门上方垂下的线绳，不久，一个驼背的老妇人打着灯笼走了出来，仔细打量了一番之后，才让他们进门。

“相信一切都会好的。”约瑟夫的父亲对扬·康迪说道，“我们不能再麻烦您了。”

“根本算不得什么麻烦，”扬·康迪回应道，“我相信你们一定会住得安稳舒适，因为一切已经安顿妥当了。明天我会派人通知您新工作的内容。那就晚安了，安德鲁·科沃斯基先生。”在说这个化名时，他稍微犹豫了一下，然后继续说道，“祝你们一切安好。”

“也愿您一切安好。”他们回答。

之后，这位谦和、博爱、德高望重的老人就再次消失在夜幕中了。当恰尔涅茨基——现在的科沃斯基一家——特林，还有那只狗都进了门之后，老妇人关上门，用力插上门闩。

“我们终于有家了。”安德鲁先生感叹道。

老妇人打着灯笼在前面带路，穿过一段尖顶走廊之后便进了庭院。特林就此向安德鲁一家道了晚安，然后走向院子右侧的房间。从在街上看到特林的脸开始，约瑟夫就对他很反感，此时又一次觉得这个人不招人待见。这张脸会深深刻在人的脑海里，出现在噩梦中，尽管在白天这只不过是张普通的脸，和上千名其他面貌平庸的学生没什么不同——但是当烛灯昏黄的光线照在他脸上的时候，却映射出了一种难以形容的邪恶。

妇人带着安德鲁一家走向左侧的楼梯，登上约瑟夫下午爬过的台阶，整个楼梯摇摇晃晃，感觉比白天晃得还要厉害。老妇人自如地走在前面，安德鲁一家小心翼翼地跟在后面，紧紧扶着栏杆，生怕脚下的楼梯突然坍塌。

他们终于上了二楼，发现房门已经打开了。埃尔兹别塔手里拿着蜡烛，在门口迎接这一家人的到来。安德鲁接过蜡烛，仔细打量着整间屋子。这里由两个房间组成，较大的那间格局整齐，一端可以用作安德鲁夫妇的卧室，另一端还有足够的空间供一家人生活起居；较小的一间在屋子后侧，可以做约瑟夫的卧室。开门的老妇人一晚上都在忙着打扫房间，她还按照安德鲁先生的吩咐，购置了一些基本生活用品，地毯、木制餐具、椅子和床。

安德鲁告诉老妇人自己的名字叫安德鲁·科沃斯基——他和扬·康迪决定用这个最为常见的姓氏做他们的化名，这名字还有铁匠的意思——虽然炼金术士和他的侄女知道他们是提辛斯基的亲戚，但也答应替他们一家人保密。

“亲爱的，”所有人都离开后，安德鲁闩紧房门，对妻子说道，“这比我们想象的好太多了。”然后他把那个珍贵的包裹放在了大房间的桌上，从扬·康迪的小房间出来之后，他就一直抱着这个包裹。“这里肯定安全，房门厚重，楼的前面是石砌的，后墙又高不可攀，而且那还是修道院的院墙，只有修道士才能出入。我们楼上是炼金术士克鲁兹，底楼住着老妇人和他的儿子，他们在晚上还看守整个院落。这座楼的对面住着几个学生，其中之一就是那个和我们顺路回来的特林。找我们的人怎么也不会想到来这里找我们，而且我们还改了名字。我们可以安心地住在这里，等国王回来。”

安德鲁正要继续和妻子分析情况，突然被门外传来的一阵奇怪的声音打断，好像有一个沉重身体正在拖着自己前行。安德鲁太太害怕地叫出声来，安德鲁先生抓起剑柄，可是约瑟夫却哈哈大笑起来。

“那是我的狗在蹭门呢，”约瑟夫笑着说道，“它又累又饿，肯定是想喝点水。院子里有口井，我去给它打点水，然后让它睡在墙角。明天我必须去找条链子或者绳子把它拴好，它挺粗野的，要是跑出去了，肯定会惹麻烦的。”说完他在篮子里找了一小块肉和一点面包，就下楼去了。院子里黑漆漆的，安德鲁太太在楼上拿着灯笼帮他照明，他给狗打了水，又把它安顿到墙角休息。

约瑟夫回到屋里时，看到父亲正准备铺床休息。那个装着宝物的包裹已经不见踪影，约瑟夫好奇地打量着大房间的每个角落，心里断定这间屋子里唯一能够隐藏宝物的地方就是床了，要么就在床底下阴暗的地方，要么就在床上或床单包裹着的衣服里面。

约瑟夫已经没有力气费脑筋思考，虽然下午睡了一觉，但他的眼皮沉重，头刚刚躺到塞了东西用作枕头的包袱上，整个世界就变得虚无缥缈了。

第二天，一家人早早就起来了。约瑟夫的母亲忙着擦拭木制家具，他父亲也忙里忙外，一会儿钉钉子加固廉价的椅子，一会儿修补墙缝，然后又去检查外面的旧楼梯是否需要修理。这么一检查，果然打消了他的疑虑，虽然楼梯有些晃动，却比想象的结实许多。如果不是故意毁坏，这楼梯或许还能用上个好几年，眼下并没有安德鲁昨晚所担心的安全隐患。

楼下的妇人给一家人送来了早饭，吃过饭，约瑟夫就牵着他的狗早早去了鸽子街。他还给狗起了名字，叫“狼”。白天的鸽子街不再像晚上那样阴森森的，那椭圆形的小窗户在晚上看着像是向下凝视的邪恶眼睛，在白天看去却像是快乐的精灵眼睛。在暮色中或是夜晚的灯光下看起来怪异恐怖的房子，此刻在阳光的照射下，只是有些歪歪扭扭，形状千奇百怪。所有底层的窗户都安着厚重的铁护栏，门上安着巨大的金属合页，每次有人进出时，门上的铁链就丁零当啷地响。有的窗户外面还晾着衣服——女人的各种服饰、男人的紧身裤、短上衣，偶尔还能看到学生穿的黑袍。街上的新鲜事物让约瑟夫深深着迷，他满心好奇地在街上流连了好长一段时间。

鸽子街的北头形成一个急转弯，那里连接着一条通向市集广场的十字街。约瑟夫和他的狗一直跑到这条名为布拉卡的十字街上，然后便顺着原路返回了他们安家的房子。他气喘吁吁地登上楼梯，兴冲冲地推开房门，正要像往常一样愉快地和父母打招呼，却发现一个陌生人正站在屋里和他的父亲谈话。这个拜访者面容和善，身上穿着皮衣，和巡夜人脱去盔甲后穿的衣服有些像。他们面前的桌子上放着一个长长的铜号，制作精巧，被擦得明晃晃的，像金子似的。

铜号的旁边放着两张羊皮纸手稿，其中一张密密麻麻的都是字，另一张，经过约瑟夫努力地分辨，是用红笔和黑笔仔细标注的乐谱。

“这个，”陌生人指着写满字的手稿说道，“是你刚刚宣誓的内容，另外一张就是《海那圣歌》的乐谱，每天晚上你都要在教堂的塔楼隔一小时吹响一次铜号。今晚你要接替的号手会把塔楼房间的钥匙交给你，然后交代你一些注意事项。吹奏《海那圣歌》是一项神圣的工作，很高兴扬·康迪神父找到了你这么优秀的波兰人来值夜班。”说完，陌生人亲吻了安德鲁先生的右侧脸颊，接着就离开了。

约瑟夫惊讶地看着这一切，《海那圣歌》？教堂的塔楼？还有他的父亲？

“我给你讲讲这件事吧，”吃午餐的时候，安德鲁和儿子说道，“按照惯例，每个圣玛利亚教堂的夜间吹号手都要宣誓，我刚才也宣了誓。你有空的时候也可以读读这个誓言。那个乐谱就是我们之前听到的那个突然终止的曲子，我答应过要给你讲这个故事的。这首乐曲要有人站在教堂高塔八角形房间的窗户旁，每个小时被吹响一次。”

“您要成为吹号手吗？”约瑟夫问道。

“是的，这多亏了好心的扬·康迪。”安德鲁说道，“我的工作不仅是那里的吹号手，而且还要守夜。因为站在教堂的高塔上整个城市都能一览无余，如果出现火情，立刻就能敲钟报警。现在我们必须为了安全考虑，用扬·康迪神父帮我们取的化名科沃斯基，从今以后，我就是安德鲁·科沃斯基，是克拉科夫城的普通人。我将担任吹号手，接替教堂原来的吹号手，这个人一周前去世了——愿他安息——他死之后有一个替他的人，但吹得很糟。”

“但那个人说夜里每个小时都要吹号，”约瑟夫大声说道，“那您一晚上都要待在那里吗？”

“对啊，”安德鲁回答，“为了我们的安全，我只能天黑以后出门，那就没人能认出我了——而你，我的孩子，在乡下我和你的老师已经教过你一些知识，所以善良的神父已经安排好了，让你到这里的大学预科班继续学业。不过，你在外面也一定要小心谨慎，因为有人一直在四处打探我们的消息，想要夺走我们的宝物。你可能很快就会和周围的男孩子打成一片，不过在外面一定要当心。回头我会买新衣服给你，换上那些衣服，我想被认出来的危险就没有了。最重要的是你要管住自己的嘴，不要和任何人说起我们的事情，时刻记住你的名字是约瑟夫·科沃斯基。”

于是，按照好心的扬·康迪的安排，安德鲁先生变为科沃斯基先生，约瑟夫被送到学校上学，而圣玛利亚教堂的瞭望塔将迎来一位新来的吹号手。

安德鲁刚说完，就听到楼梯上传来噔噔的脚步声，接着埃尔兹别塔·克鲁兹就跑进了他们的房间，直接扑到了安德鲁太太的怀里。“我们会在这里过得很快乐，”女人高兴地说道，“这个孩子需要母亲的关爱。”女孩扭过头微笑地望着安德鲁先生，她的眼睛令他的面色变得柔和，他牵起女孩纤细的小手亲吻了一下——精巧的小白手在他巨大的深棕色手掌上简直就像一幅画。

“我叔叔和我说，”埃尔兹别塔说道，“您要到教堂当吹号手了。我晚上睡不着，感觉孤独或者害怕的时候，就会仔细聆听教堂传来的号声。现在我知道是约瑟夫的父亲在吹奏乐曲，就能很快睡着，什么也不怕了。”

“我现在就像有了两个孩子，”安德鲁高兴地说道，一只手搂着埃尔兹别塔，一只手搂着自己的儿子，“这真是上帝对我们的眷顾。”





第六章　吹号手的塔楼


坐落于克拉科夫的圣玛利亚教堂是中欧最为宏伟的建筑之一，即使在那些遥远的日子里，世界各地的人都要远道而来一睹它的壮丽风采。这座教堂现在正庄严地耸立在这座中世纪的老城，远处就能清晰地看到它的两座高塔，而红色的砖墙就和瓦维尔山的石基一样坚固结实。不过，从外部看来，它并不如更具贵族气派的瓦维尔大教堂那么引人注目。圣玛利亚教堂没有飞拱，也没有独特的哥特式装饰，外墙上看不到巨大的石头滴水嘴、雕花，甚至圣像，不过它优雅的外表展示了一种坚实和宏伟的力量。它和艳阳高照的法国的大教堂不同，没有轻柔的微风和灿烂阳光的爱抚，容不下精美的雕刻和纤细的高塔，它的外形看起来更像是一座坚固的堡垒，以便抵御从荒芜的干旱草原或者波罗的海吹来的席卷整个波兰的强劲风暴。真正吸引人们的是这座教堂绝美的内部装饰，那可谓是隐藏在石头之中的一颗华丽水晶。

一家人来到新居的第一天，夜幕刚刚降临，安德鲁先生便带着约瑟夫去了这座教堂。安德鲁先生将铜号夹在右臂之下。当他们到达较高的那座塔楼下方时，教堂的守门人审视了他们一番，然后打开了一道通往塔楼的厚重小门。他们在黑暗中沿着狭窄的楼梯盘旋而上，最后来到一个平台，塔楼的主体便豁然出现。约瑟夫发现平台的右侧还有一扇门，通向一个小礼堂。后来他才知道，死刑犯人行刑前几个小时就待在那里。

一个手提着灯笼的男人从上面向他们喊话，他们原地不动等着男人下来，这个人就是白天值班的吹号手，安德鲁先生就是要接替他在晚上守夜。那个男人下来后，亲吻了安德鲁先生的脸颊以示欢迎，然后简单介绍了他在塔楼的职责。他把灯笼和一把钥匙交到安德鲁先生手里，那把钥匙用来打开吹号手在高塔上的值班房间。他祝父子俩第一个晚上一切顺利，然后就顺着侧面的楼梯下到底层，出了教堂。父子俩开始登上通向塔顶的简易楼梯，这座简易楼梯由木梁固定，木梁的边缘搭着台阶，他们上楼的时候，就这样沿着塔内的墙壁盘旋而上。这楼梯又陡又窄，但是非常坚固，走在上面没有任何咯吱声。

他们顺着楼梯爬啊爬，经过了五层由白色小水晶球镶嵌的玻璃窗，向上再向上，终于来到了吹号手工作的楼层。这个地方呈八角形，分成两部分，有一个供吹号手在整点之间取暖休息的小房间，房间周围是开放的空间，透过窗户可以瞭望整座城市。墙上挂着闲置的铜号，几根绳子和悬挂在矮塔上的大钟相连接，还有用来提示火情的红旗和灯笼。

时刻关注火情是吹号手的职责。他同时也要监视城市附近的军情以及城里的任何骚动和骚乱，不过最主要的任务还是监视火情。大火已经给这座城市带来了太多的伤害，城里的建筑大多是木质的，即使正面有石墙，但房顶用的不是茅草就是软木头，有一点火星都能引起大火。当吹号手在塔楼上发现火情后，就要在面向火灾发生地点的窗口挂起红旗；如果是夜晚，就要挂起嵌着红玻璃的灯笼。

如果出现任何威胁市民生命安全的危险，吹号手还要敲响警钟。在安德鲁先生一家来到克拉科夫的前一个月，这里的吹号手就因为察觉到针对提辛斯基一家的暴动而敲响了警钟。来年，煽动那场暴乱的四个人将在塔楼下方的广场被执行死刑，届时也要敲钟。可以说，这座塔楼就是克拉科夫的活动中心。

安德鲁先生把钥匙插进了小房间的门锁，拉开门闩，进入里面的房间。约瑟夫跟在后面，发现这个房间虽然不大，但很舒适，里面有一张桌子、一张床、一个小炉子，墙上还挂着一只点燃的灯笼。桌旁的三张椅子由于空间的限制而紧紧地挤在一起。桌上放着一个巨大的沙漏，约瑟夫还是第一次见到这么大的沙漏呢。沙子细细地从上端的玻璃球流入下端的玻璃球，已经快流到标记着拉丁文数字“十”的位置了，表明马上就要十点了。这个沙漏里的沙子全部流完实际上需要十二个小时，上面的线条和拉丁文数字都是工匠在沙漏定型之后，但材质依旧发软的时候标记上去的。吹号手就以这个沙漏的时间为准。在教堂正殿的屋顶上，阳光照射的地方有一个巨大的日晷，用来校准每天正午的时间。塔楼的北墙上也挂着一台钟表，上面只有一个时针。这个时针由一片金属打造成人手造型——一只握着的拳头，四个手指弯曲，食指指向时钟的刻度。

当沙子流到十点刻度时，安德鲁先生迅速走到塔楼的开放区域，解开缠绕在中心柱子上的绳子。这根绳子穿过地上的洞穴和楼下的圆木滑轮相连接，然后又绕过滑轮，穿过墙上的一个小孔连接到较矮的那座塔楼上。那个小孔以前是当有外敌侵袭时射箭用的。较矮的那座塔楼里，一个铁锤悬挂在大钟的上方，锤子的尾端和从小孔穿过的绳子相连。拉动绳子的时候，锤子就会下降；松动绳子的时候，这个铁锤就会在金属和皮质弹簧的牵引下，弹回原处。安德鲁先生拉了一下绳子——铁锤下降——砰！钟声响彻城市上空。他拉了一次又一次，直到大钟被敲响十次。

然后，他走到离休息间门口不远的地方，打开一扇小玻璃窗，拿起铜号，开始吹奏《海那圣歌》。他开始是在西边，朝着老布楼的方向，能看到远处的克拉科夫大学。然后，他又走到另一扇窗口，朝着南方吹奏。之后，他又按照规定，分别朝着东方和北方吹奏。此时，整个城市已经是万家灯火，微风中带着刚被收割的新鲜青草的味道。从大学的方向传来一群人唱诵圣歌的声音。格罗兹卡街上传来嗒嗒的马蹄声，骑马的不知是住在城堡里的贵族仆人，还是皇家卫兵。巡夜人用长矛的尾部敲击着商店的大门，以确定没有粗心的学徒或者家仆忘了锁门。圣玛利亚教堂下方的墓园一片沉寂，白色的石碑在昏暗中呈现出一片黯淡的灰色。路的对面，点灯人正在点燃挂在布楼屋檐下的灯笼里的大根灯芯。星星一颗接一颗地出现在还有一抹蓝色的天空中，安德鲁刚刚吹奏的《海那圣歌》的音符就飘荡在这柔和的夜里。

“真美妙啊！”约瑟夫感叹道。

“是啊，孩子。”安德鲁也感叹道。借着此情此景，安德鲁向约瑟夫谈起了多年前鞑靼人占领教堂下方广场的那个早晨，讲述了那个在生命的最后一刻依旧坚守誓言的少年，还有后来的吹号手通过突然中断《海那圣歌》的结尾而向少年致敬的传统。

约瑟夫听得心潮澎湃，眼里泛起了泪花，这一刻他比以往任何时候都深刻地意识到祖国是多么可爱，正是那些英勇的先人所做的努力才让这个国家如此伟大。他站在塔楼的小窗户前，静静地望着窗外，一想到多年前那个年轻生命的牺牲，他的眼泪就涌上眼眶，但当他想到年轻人的高尚行为，心中就备受鼓舞，升腾起一股自豪感，从而止住了眼泪。

然后，父子俩回到了号手休息的房间。

“今晚我给你带了这个，”安德鲁先生关上门，把铜号挂到墙上之后，对约瑟夫说道，“你可以了解一下教堂号手的职责。以防有一天我病了或者是受伤了——这都说不定——毕竟我现在有很多敌人。我已经宣誓每个小时都吹响号角，那可不是空口说说就完了，我刚才给你讲的那个故事就是证明。不论发生任何事情，都要按时吹响号角。所以，”他拿出一张羊皮纸，用一块木炭在上面画出几条线，“你要用心记住我画的这些音符。”

“这是《海那圣歌》的乐谱，”他在羊皮纸上画了一阵，然后继续说，“曲调是这样的。”他哼起调子，一边指着羊皮纸上相应的音符。

“这个，”他说，“你一定要学会，接下来的一个星期你要好好学，下个礼拜的这个时候你得能把它写出来。不过，不要因此影响了你的学业，你要抽时间看。另外，如果可以，就默唱《海那圣歌》的曲调。等你学会了调子，我就教你吹号。这个任务并不难，不过要想吹得好，必须要足够努力。我会教你单音、双音还有三音，它们都是演奏小号的重中之重，就像文法是学术领域的根基一样。”

约瑟夫把羊皮纸塞到了衣服里面。

“现在，”安德鲁说道，“你赶快下楼回家吧。下去以后，把灯笼挂到底层的墙上，别忘了吹灭里面的灯芯。你母亲还等着你，她肯定觉得孤独呢。”

“不会的，埃尔兹别塔和她在一起呢。”

“上帝保佑那个孩子。不过，你还是赶紧走吧，夜深了，街上很危险，尽量和巡夜人同路，如果有人问你为什么这么晚还出来，你就说你父亲是塔楼的吹号手，你是回家去送信的。”

约瑟夫下了楼，把熄灭的灯笼挂在了简易楼梯的底层，然后摸索着走到了塔楼的大门。他敲了一阵，然后看门人把他放了出去。刚出教堂大门，约瑟夫就像风一样开始奔跑，一直到了鸽子街才放慢了脚步。

让他吃惊的是，给他开门的并不是那个看管院子的老妇人，而是她的儿子，他以前一直没有露过面。灯笼的光线照到他的脸上时，约瑟夫警觉地向后退了一步，他父亲和他说过老妇人和她的儿子住在一起，在他的想象中，那个儿子肯定是个年轻人，甚至是个小孩——他没想到眼前的这个人竟然长了一张中年人的脸。不过，与其用“人”来形容他，还不如用“怪物”一词更加恰当，因为他骨瘦如柴，背驼得不成样子；长长的头发遮挡着眼睛，双手瘦骨嶙峋，像爪子一样；他的脸颊凹陷，眼睛像是怕光似的藏在深深的眼窝里。他手里提着灯笼，走在约瑟夫的前面，像猫一样贴着墙壁，躲躲闪闪的，好像一直担心有人会从后面袭击他似的。

在楼梯的底部，他停了下来。

约瑟夫正要绕过他上楼梯，这个怪物突然举起一只手，按在了约瑟夫的肩膀上。约瑟夫听到了长指甲在他衣服上摩擦的声音——在那个可怕的瞬间，他仿佛感到那双手已经覆在了他的皮肤上。他的额头上冒出了冷汗。

“你想要什么？”

“一点，一点小钱。”男人悄悄说道。

约瑟夫痛快地递给他一枚铜板。

“好孩子，好孩子，”男人咕哝着，“上帝保佑你，保佑你。等你发财了，一定不要忘了斯塔斯。我叫斯塔斯，我就住在这里。”他说着，一边指着底楼敞着门的一个房间，但是约瑟夫根本没有在意，他的注意力完全被一束跳跃的火光所吸引，那是从四楼炼金术士阁楼的小窗户发出来的。那仅仅是一点点光亮，从那个打开的小窗户发出来——炼金术士通常紧闭那个窗户——一两秒钟之后就熄灭了，但是在那一个瞬间整个庭院和周围的建筑都被照亮了。

“嘿，”男人指着上面说道，“他们会灵魂和身体的分离之术……知道吗？”在他说话的时候又出现一道光，比之前的更亮，持续时间也更长——“他们召唤来了恶魔，带来了地狱之火……炼金术士克鲁兹就是魔鬼的仆人，我们这个院子里还住着一个像魔鬼的人……你知道我说的是谁吧？”他突然把灯笼提到约瑟夫的面前，吓得男孩向后退了几步。“就是那个叫特林的学生！他会和魔鬼做交易，把灵魂都交给魔鬼。以为我没听见过他夜里在房间里叨叨咕咕，喊叫吟唱？他就是这座房子的诅咒……好了，我得睡觉了。祝你晚安。”说完，他便走进了那扇开着的房门里。





第七章　炼金术士的阁楼


约瑟夫回到自己的小房间，昏昏欲睡，把阁楼里发出的闪光完全抛到了脑后，也无暇猜测斯塔斯神神道道的话语。第二天，约瑟夫就开始了在大学预科的学习，所有无关紧要的事情都暂时被他抛在了脑后。然而，大约一周之后的一天晚上，同样的情景再次出现了。那天，约瑟夫和往常一样，陪着父亲去了塔楼，回来的时候天色还早，他就在门口的露台上待了一会儿。夜色宜人，他欣然地望着被星光照亮的屋顶、红色的烟囱和黑色的墙。“狼”睡在约瑟夫的脚下，不安地扭动着身体，仿佛是在做噩梦。他身旁就是他居住的屋子，透过小窗户射出微弱的灯光，从照在窗户上的剪影可以看出他母亲正坐在那里，可能和埃尔兹别塔在一起，她白天说晚上要过来的。

夜色甜美温柔，约瑟夫陷入了沉思，就像其他年轻人那样。他琢磨着父亲千里迢迢带到克拉科夫的那个宝物会是什么。或许那是一块价值相当于千千万万兹罗提[1]的宝石？或许只是一块样式别致的玻璃，只有研究玻璃的工匠才认可它的价值？但为什么扬·康迪对它也如此重视呢？为什么那个胆大狂妄的陌生人想要将其占为己有呢？为什么世界如此平静，而他们却要更名改姓，只能在夜色的掩护下生活呢？为什么？

闪光！一道闪光突然打破了沉静的夜色！他和斯塔斯单独在院子里的那天晚上就出现了同样的光！只是，伴随着这道闪光，突然传来了一声害怕又痛苦的尖叫。

他上方平台处的房门突然打开，一个白色的身影出现了，匆匆跑下楼来，等她靠近时约瑟夫认出是埃尔兹别塔，她穿着睡衣，身上披了一条白色的床单。

他怕自己吓到埃尔兹别塔，立刻开口。

“埃尔兹别塔！”他说，“是我，我是约瑟夫。发生什么事了？”

“我叔叔，”她叫道，“约瑟夫，我不知道他们在干什么。”

“我以为你和我母亲在一起呢。”约瑟夫急切地说。

“本来是的，可后来我太困了，她就催我上楼睡觉了。我睡着了，睡了一会儿，然后听到了大声的谈话声和噪音。”她凑到约瑟夫身边，继续说道，“约瑟夫，我好害怕。楼上肯定发生了什么不好的事情。那个叫特林的学生现在总是和我叔叔在一起，他一到晚上就来了，然后就和我叔叔一直待在楼上。我叔叔以前从来不会在阁楼过夜——他会陪着我。约瑟夫，我害怕那个特林。”

“我能理解你的感受。”约瑟夫说道。

“我觉得他掌握着并非来自这个世界的支配他人的力量，”埃尔兹别塔继续说道，“你不知道自从他找上门以后我叔叔的变化有多大，而我总是孤零零的。”

“你今天晚上听到了什么？”约瑟夫问道。

“我被楼上巨大的跺脚声吵醒了，然后，听见我叔叔说，‘不行，那会出人命的。’还听到那个学生发出恐怖的笑声。之后很长一段时间都没有声音。在我就要再次睡着的时候，又传来了另一个声音——我从来没听过那个声音。我总觉得那是我叔叔在说话，但那个声音和语调让我毛骨悚然。最后出现了几束闪光。约瑟夫，你能不能帮帮我，从楼梯上去，从小窗口看看？别让他们看见你，也别待太长时间。你只要能确认我叔叔在里面安然无恙就立刻下来。”

“我会去的。不过，你先去找我母亲吧。今晚，如果你愿意的话，可以睡在我们家，明天我再和我父亲商量该怎么办。”

说完，他敲了敲门，但没等他母亲来开门，就跑上楼梯，踏上了通向阁楼的简陋木梯。这段楼梯要比底下的楼梯陡峭许多，所以他只能紧紧抓着旁边的栏杆，慢慢向上爬。这段楼梯在晚上爬起来令他有些晕眩，但他还是敏捷地登上了阁楼的露台，正好可以通过打开的窗户角落看到里面。幸亏窗户是开着的，如果像往常一样关着，他就什么也看不见了，因为玻璃是用凹凸不平的小圆块组成的，并没有抛光。他偷偷地从窗口望进去，一面紧抓着楼梯的栏杆支撑自己的身体，一只脚靠近最上面的台阶，以便在屋里人察觉到有第三个人存在的时候，能尽快脱身。

屋内的景象让他大吃一惊，他看到四个铜盆从天花板上吊下来，里面正烧着油，整个阁楼就像着了火一样，发出耀眼的光芒。为了避免把房顶烧着，铜盆的上方放有几层相互间隔的金属板。这样，隔板中间的气流就能够使温度降下来，房顶就不会被火焰烤着了。还有一个铜盆，就挂在约瑟夫所在的窗口附近，里面没有东西，之前照亮整个院子的光亮就是从这里发出的——确切地说，那是炼金术士往盆里的木炭上扔的一把粉末快速燃烧发出的光亮。

阁楼要比约瑟夫想象的高许多，内部是一个宽敞的大房间，屋子的另一侧就是整个建筑物的外墙，上面还有几扇窗户。房间的中后方有一个橱柜，约瑟夫觉得那里一定装着克鲁兹先生最珍贵的物品，因为整个柜子用铁链套着，还安着一把巨大的锁。屋顶的横梁稍稍倾斜，但身材高大的人完全可以在里面自由活动，横梁的木头也不是普通阁楼所用的原木，而是在表面涂了一层厚厚的白漆。

屋子的正中间立着一个三脚架，上面放着一口铁锅，里面正烧着什么东西，散发出一股特殊的刺鼻味道。

炼金术士穿着他的黑袍，特林穿着皮衣，两人并肩坐在铁锅前面，紧紧盯着锅里燃烧的多彩火焰。

“我已经精疲力竭，”约瑟夫听到炼金术士对特林说道，“你所建议的实验方法太费精力了。我确实对它感兴趣，也知道它的魅力所在，但它毕竟不是我所擅长的领域。我是个炼金术士，研究的是物质之间相互作用的真理。我把醋、糖和苏打混合起来就会立即产生气泡，发生变化；我将铅、银、铜熔化，就可以合成一种新的金属。”

“这些变化不是也受到天空中星星的位置影响吗？”特林问道。

“既是又非。我承认，海的潮汐似乎和月亮的位置有关，庄稼的收获依赖于四季的变化，而四季的变化又由天体的运动所决定。但其他的事情，我并不清楚。而且，我也不是占星师，我是炼金术士。天空的力量应该由那些研究天空的人来发现。”

“难道人的行为和生命不是由星星决定的吗？”

“那就只能交给魔法师和巫师去解答了，同样，那种炮制猫爪、猫头鹰眼睛和死人手指混合物的恐怖魔法也得由他们来解释。”

“但是，”特林坚持问道，“你也在研究长生不老之术，不是吗？”

“不，”炼金术士回答道，“虽然我对它充满好奇。如果万事万物都在变化之中，那么只要掌握了逆转生命进程的法则，人就能像由少变老一样返老还童。所以，我并不怀疑有人能够重返青春。不过，相比那些想要重新活一次的碌碌无为之人，我对此并不感兴趣。”

“那点金石呢？你怎么看？”约瑟夫注意到这个学生在提到这个问题时语气有明显的变化，他的眼睛里闪烁着贪婪的光芒，手也不自觉地攥成了拳头。

“嗯，”炼金术士回答说，“很多人都寻找过点金石。对于那些迷信无知的人来说，点金石仅仅是一种具备魔力的物质，可以将任何与之接触的东西变成金子，就像古代的米达斯国王[2]的魔法。但对于我们这些研究者来说，这背后的过程才是实现点石成金的原因，而不是那颗石头。”

“那是怎么回事呢？要怎么做呢？”特林的身子前倾，迫切地想知道答案。

“世上的任何物质，比如铜、纸张或者玻璃等，本身都具有特定的属性。我们的知识之父阿基米德不是早就证实，不同物质分别被扔到水里时，排出的水量都不同吗？黄金是一种物质，铜也是一种物质，二者在被置于火、水、气、土和其他元素中都易于改变。火能够熔化物质，水能够改变物质的颜色或者将其分解，空气能使物质发硬，而土能够使物质发黑。如果能够破解黄金和铜之间的不同之处，那么把铜变成金子或者把金子变成铜并不是不可能的事情。”

“那你为什么不继续尝试，并且找出其背后的秘密呢？”

炼金术士深吸了一口气，说：“因为我还有更感兴趣的事情。虽然我只是个炼金术士，但我更关注物质背后的精神问题。我想知道生命本身是否就是一种物质，人与人之间的差别和金属与金属之间的差别有什么不同；我想探寻大地的秘密以及天空传递的信息；我还想知道灵魂的秘密，如何能够帮助并拯救那些天生身体有缺陷的人的灵魂。如果可以，我还想知道世界的构造、季节交替的原因，如此种种——我想知道为什么星星会闪烁，为什么大海会出现风暴。上帝给予了我一个寻求光明的大脑，我感觉自己在探索真理的时候，就是在接受上帝的指引。”

特林靠近克鲁兹，低声说着什么，不过约瑟夫依然能听清他的话。

“你是个傻瓜，克鲁兹先生，”他说，“作为这个时代最具天赋的学者和炼金术士，你却把时间浪费在这些追求上，而无视眼前更为伟大的目标。”

“你的意思是？”

“你明白我的意思。我们已经开始尝试做那些人们知之甚少的实验了。”

“我知道，但是我拿不定主意。你的建议中有些东西我不喜欢。但在那些方面你懂的比我多，你是老师，我是学生。不久之前，你让我陷入催眠状态时，我看到了平日里并不熟悉的事情，还听到了一些奇怪的声音，那时我就知道你并不一般。可是，这种实验虽然让人着迷，但可能存在危险。我相信，在纽伦堡，还有黑林山的偏远地区曾经有人尝试过这个实验，但在克拉科夫，我们一直都对此持保守态度。”

炼金术士凝视着火焰。特林坐在他的旁边，在炼金术士说话的时候，他睥睨着炼金术士，眼神中透露着恶毒之光，让约瑟夫不寒而栗。约瑟夫的脑海中闪现出“魔鬼”一词——在黑暗中特林看起来活脱脱像个魔鬼，试图蛊惑炼金术士。

不过那个眼神一闪而过。“克鲁兹先生，”特林又开始说道，“我在纽伦堡老镇的老师告诉过我，人实际上有两个大脑。其中一个大脑聪明、有力量，占主导位置，但只有在催眠状态下它才得以发挥作用，就像之前我把你催眠一样。另一个大脑掌管我们的日常生活，告诉我们何时吃饭，何时工作，何时休息。但这个大脑处于次要地位。”

“是的，这些你已经向我证明过了。”炼金术士说道。

“那就赶快利用你的高级大脑啊。”特林带着命令的口吻说道。

“用它做什么呢？”克鲁兹问道。

“为了人们都想得到的——金子！”

他一字一顿说话的样子，让约瑟夫打了一个寒战。

“对我来说，金子并没有那么重要。”炼金术士回答道。

“重要啊——它重要的——它当然重要了！”特林坚持道，“你还不知道它能给你带来什么。只要掌握了点金术，你我二人就能成为这世间的王者。我们可以住在世上最华美的宫殿里，我们将拥有各种奇珍异宝，你可以像当今有权势的皇室贵胄一样到欧洲各国游历，我们将能掌控军队，并让全人类都按我们的意志行事。”

他一时间忘记了炼金术士的存在，沉浸于幻想和欲望织就的美梦里，但当他发现克鲁兹并没有受到触动时，就巧妙地转换了话锋，“想想吧，作为炼金术士你能做什么吧！这个阁楼就是你做实验的理想场所吗？用这些简陋的工具怎么可能研制出新物质，又怎么能证明物质之间转换的法则呢？有了点金术，你就能成为波兰——不，是全世界最伟大的炼金术士。你所工作的房间将能够容纳十几个这样的破阁楼，里面会有研究炼金术所需要的一切工具。什么东方传来的物质啊，无价的珍宝啊，珍贵的石头啊，你都有办法搞到。这难道还不够吸引你吗？”

这次，炼金术士被打动了。“任何贫困的学者都会为之吸引，”克鲁兹回答道，他说话的声音都好像被想象到的画面突然点亮了，语气变得热切起来，“那你认为我，就是你所说的那个更强大的自我，掌握着把普通金属变成黄金的秘密吗？”

“我肯定！”特林兴奋地说道，几乎要绕着椅子跳起来，“只要你别再犯傻，别再做个死板的学究，而是全心全意、夜以继日地潜心于研究这个宇宙问题。金子——金子——金子！那才是人人都想要的东西！成功总是意味着金钱，那些追求高尚无私的目标的人们，大多倾其一生却一事无成，只不过是为了赢得人们的尊重——甚至只是在欺骗自己。想想吧，只要有了金子——你能给你侄女带来什么，你可以为你的学生们带去什么，你可以让克拉科夫大学，甚至整个波兰成为世界上最伟大、最吸引人的地方。”

克鲁兹陷入了沉思。虽然约瑟夫年轻，缺乏阅历，但他明显感到炼金术士的心智已经完全被特林蛊惑了。确实，现在克鲁兹已经开始用特林的逻辑来看待自己的生活了，他自己的生活只是一个无聊的学究的生活，他的生活不仅困顿而且愚蠢，只要他愿意，就可以摆脱这一切，过上好日子。现在，机会就摆在他的面前，只要去做，就能改变他所爱的人的生活。他的想法开始天马行空、不切实际了。他曾经是一个理想主义者，一门心思地研究他所认为的人类智慧的结晶——是啊，他以前就是那个样子，一个无聊的老学究！

克鲁兹这么思考着，完全向特林臣服了。“你说得对，我完全相信，”他叹了一口气，说道，“或许像你说的，只要我们掌握了点金术的秘密，就能主宰世界。有了黄金，我们就能做很多事情，达成我们的心愿，接济穷人，治疗病患，让这个国家彻底远离贫困。是啊，这毕竟是项高尚的任务——我们今晚要不要再重新实验一次？再给我催眠一次？”

“不，”特林的目的已经达到了，“时间已经太晚了，而且我不想让两次实验间隔这么短，免得效果不佳。等明天晚上，我们都恢复了元气，再尝试吧……我有点好奇，刚才在你进入深度催眠的时候，你大喊着说所有的占星家、炼金术士和魔法师几百年来所梦寐以求的东西正触手可及。我猜测，我们要有重要发现了。”

“唉，不巧那时候我被吵醒了。”炼金术士说道。

“是啊，真不走运！”特林苦恼地说，“要不是那声尖叫让你恢复了清醒，我们将会有重大发现。那是你侄女在楼下尖叫。”

“埃尔兹别塔？”炼金术士担心地问道，“那她为什么要喊叫呢？”

“你在催眠的状态下也不安生，喊着说有恶魔在你身边，要杀了你——而且害怕得几乎尖叫起来，然后又糊里糊涂地说了些什么话。”

“那我回应那孩子了吗？”

“没有，你又沉沉地陷入椅子里，睡着了，进入了自然睡眠，我再问你什么你也不说了。”

炼金术士揉着眼睛，说：“我现在确实困了。”接着，又好奇地琢磨着，“那个重大发现会是什么呢？这附近好像也没什么值钱的东西啊。底楼住着老妇人和她的傻儿子，用火就能把他吓着。二楼住着三个可怜的逃难者，最近才搬进来。院子对面就是你和两个穷学生。这些人怎么也不像是有宝贝的人。好吧，听你的，今晚就这样吧……”听到这儿，约瑟夫就飞快地爬下了楼梯。

第八章　纽扣脸彼得


暑去秋来。酷热的天气让维斯瓦河的水位不断降低，逐渐流成了一条细长的丝带，干涸的河床露出了大片的黄色泥沙。树叶渐渐由绿变黄，候鸟已经做好了向南迁徙的准备，一旦出现天气转凉的信号，就立刻出发。大草原上每天都有来来往往的马和车，全国各地的谷仓和棚子里都已经堆满了干草。秋天的果实已经上市，头茬的苹果、金色的小南瓜、晚熟的卷心菜摆满了市场。整个城市，甚至整个国家的天空都是湛蓝而美妙的。初秋之时，全世界任何地方的天空都不及克拉科夫的蓝，任何地方的阳光都不及克拉科夫的灿烂。

收获石楠的月份过去，又到了收获大麻的时节。此时，约瑟夫已经掌握了《海那圣歌》的整首乐谱，能够用他父亲的铜号吹奏这首短小的颂歌了。他甚至还在圣玛利亚教堂的塔楼上吹奏了一次。那天晚上，他的父亲朝着西面、南面和东面的窗口各吹奏了一次，就把朝着北面窗口吹奏的任务交给了约瑟夫。

聪明伶俐的埃尔兹别塔比约瑟夫的乐感还好，她早已记住了约瑟夫的乐谱，不仅能哼出《海那圣歌》的曲子，还能在墙上或者羊皮纸上一行不差地把乐谱默写下来。

这天晚上，埃尔兹别塔又来找安德鲁太太——她现在经常下来，因为她的叔叔忙着和特林进行新的实验。

约瑟夫突然兴奋地说道：“不久之后，我就能朝着四个方向吹奏《海那圣歌》啦！”

埃尔兹别塔一只手托着下巴，每一次严肃思考和说话的时候她都是这个样子。“我一定认真地听，”她说道，“现在，当我在夜里听到《海那圣歌》的乐曲，都会比以往更觉得心安——每次半夜醒来的时候，房间里经常空空荡荡的。约瑟夫，”她降低了声调说道，“你知道吗，我觉得我叔叔好像着魔了。”

约瑟夫被这话一惊，“着魔？着什么魔？”

“我也不知道，但他完全像变了一个人。他并没有丧失神志，他很正常，和以前一样精明，也像过去一样和蔼，但他的心思都在阁楼里，几乎不关心我了，也不和其他的朋友打交道了。还有那个学生，约翰·特林——”

“嗯，我知道他。”约瑟夫马上回答道。

“他和我叔叔每天晚上都在阁楼上，有时候一直待到天亮。他们总是说些奇怪的事情，有几次我还听到我叔叔的叫喊声，好像很痛苦。我让你帮我上楼察看的那晚你也听到过那种声音，一样的声音。”

“我把那天晚上听到的都告诉我父亲了，”约瑟夫接着说道，“他只是说我们管不着别人的事情，而且你叔叔对我们一直很好，他知道自己在做什么。我父亲还让我不要再去偷听。他说你叔叔是个伟大的学者，现在也许是在进行会让他声名大振的研究。”

“唉，也许吧，”埃尔兹别塔若有所思地说着，“但我还是更喜欢我叔叔以前的样子。”

从那时候起，埃尔兹别塔更像是安德鲁先生家中的一员。下午她会带着针线来到楼下，一边干活，一边和安德鲁太太聊天，有时还低声哼着小曲。每天傍晚约瑟夫从学校回来后，两人就结伴到街上散步，看看城里一天发生的新鲜事，看看是不是有新来的商队、露天表演，看看骑士和士兵队伍以及商会的游行。有时候他们也穿过城门，去郊外看看，那里有成片的富饶黑土。每次出去，那只鞑靼人的大狗总是跟着，有时跑在他们身后，有时跟在他们旁边，有时会跑到他们前面。他们也会走到犹太老城卡其米日，穿过横跨在维斯瓦河西边的桥，到达斯加尔卡的老教堂，据说圣人斯坦尼斯拉斯就是在那里的圣坛上被杀害的。他们也会走到能俯瞰城市的高地，老国王克拉库斯就葬在那里。趁天色还不晚，空气还不算寒冷的时候，他们还一起去了许多这样的地方。

一天黄昏，他们一起来到圣玛利亚教堂。守门人让他们从塔楼下面的小门进入，然后他们爬上了塔楼号手的房间。白天的吹号手正在值班，安德鲁先生晚上接替的就是这个人。有埃尔兹别塔这么年轻的姑娘来塔楼参观，让他倍感荣幸。他兴奋地讲了许多关于圣玛利亚教堂的传奇故事，这些故事都是从教堂建立的时候传下来的。

约瑟夫从桌子上拿起了他父亲的铜号，对埃尔兹别塔说道：“等我第一次吹奏四次《海那圣歌》的时候，你一定要听啊，看看我有没有吹错哪个音符。”

“我一定好好听。”

“如果我吹错了一个音符，就把我的帽子给你；要是吹错了两个，‘狼’就归你了。”约瑟夫微笑着，然后说出了一个孩子气的想法，“如果我完整地吹出《海那圣歌》，而没有突然的停顿，你就去找扬·康迪神父，让他召集卫兵，因为那肯定是我出意外了。”

“你是什么意思？”埃尔兹别塔满脸严肃地看着笑嘻嘻的约瑟夫。

“你知道这首曲子《海那圣歌》的故事吗？”

“知道。”埃尔兹别塔回答。

“那你一定知道鞑靼人放火烧城的时候，当时值班的号手一直坚守岗位，在生命的最后一刻依旧坚守誓言，按时吹响号角吧。”

“嗯……是个非常勇敢的故事。”

“那么，”约瑟夫欣喜地看到埃尔兹别塔睁大了蓝色的眼睛，“如果有一天晚上，鞑靼人或者十字军再次攻城，我在塔楼上就能远远地看到他们，透过火与烟，我肯定还能听到战争的喧嚣和马蹄声。那天晚上，我孤身一人在塔楼上守望，既没有我父亲，也没有其他人的陪伴。当我意识到敌军来临的时候，我必须发出信号，因为我不能离开塔楼，便只能发出一个好让城里的某人替我发出警报的信号。我将吹响《海那圣歌》，但我不会像往常一样在中断的音符处停下来，我会继续吹奏出剩下的几个音符，完成整个乐曲。”

“太棒了！”埃尔兹别塔大声说道，脸颊兴奋地红润起来，“如果我听到你完整地吹奏《海那圣歌》，我就立刻去找扬·康迪神父。”

“好了，到这儿来看看这座城市。”约瑟夫中断了这个话题，他心中有一丝歉疚，因为他完全没有想到埃尔兹别塔会如此严肃地对待他所说的话。他本来只是把号角信号的话当成玩笑而已，但她却像是得知了亲密朋友分享的秘密一样，兴奋不已。而且，约瑟夫确实在她生命中占有重要地位，这不仅是因为他在吹号方面能力出众，或者是他在学校里表现优异，而是因为他比同龄的男孩子更加成熟稳重。

他们站在一扇小窗前面，向外望去。右侧是圣弗洛里安街，这条街一直通向城门和城外的教堂。这一年城墙内正在建造新的塔楼，其中两座靠近弗洛里安城门，从圣玛利亚教堂的塔内就能看见。城里的每个商会都掌管着一座塔楼，负责塔楼的维修以及在外敌进攻的时候召集人手。靠近这座城门的两座塔楼分配给了工匠商会和裁缝商会。教堂和这些塔楼之间的空地上还建着许多宫殿，每个宫殿的中间都有一个巨大的露天围场，里面的卫兵有的在执勤，有的在等待任务，还有一些在自娱自乐，要么用铁头木棒敲打对方的头，要么练习击剑，要么就瞄准绑在高杆顶上的鸽子练习射箭。

虽然已经将近傍晚，圣玛利亚大教堂正下方的市场依然很热闹，这时农民们都开始甩卖剩下的货物准备回家了；布楼的拱廊下面，人们依然逐个摊位地逛着，挑选花边布、刺绣和丝绸，这些可都是从东部和南部的地区运来的；老布楼的后面可以看到市政大厅的高塔，有两个不幸的人正在被当街示众，他们戴着枷锁挣扎着，一群调皮的小孩正捡起地上的烂菜叶子和泥巴往他们身上扔。从窗户的左侧可以看到圣方济各教堂的塔顶——之后，他们转到南面的窗口，那里能够看见圣安德鲁教堂的双子塔，再远处，宏大的石头城堡瓦维尔城堡在傍晚的阳光下金碧辉煌。

他们从教堂的塔楼下来时，暗蓝色的影子已经拉长，覆盖了市集广场。那些位于开放空间的宫殿也投射出重重叠叠的影子，身穿黑袍的学生和教师们像是行走的影子，悠闲地走在房屋的阴影下。这些人都朝着同一个方向，约瑟夫和埃尔兹别塔也被卷到了人群中，他们跟随着人流，猜想学生广场上肯定发生了什么事情。

越来越多穿黑袍的人围到一起，最后，约瑟夫和埃尔兹别塔停下脚步，费力地冲出左右推搡的人群，才到了圣安街的宿舍前面的一个有利位置。这个宿舍楼向内缩在路的一边，楼前是一片长满青草的开阔空地，草地的正中央竖立着一座卡济米尔大帝的雕像，是他创办了克拉科夫大学。就在这座雕像的底座上面，一个人穿着文学硕士长袍，正斜靠在支撑着卡济米尔雕像的王座上，用拉丁语向聚集起来的学生演讲。

“我今天正好听人讲到他了，”约瑟夫悄悄地告诉埃尔兹别塔，“他是个著名的学者，来自意大利，来这里给大家念诵大师的作品和他自己写的诗。他提到了但丁和彼特拉克之类的诗人，他说终有一天新学会成为主流。他还说人们已经被黑暗和无知蒙蔽太久了，只有当人们能够用母语书写并自我思考的时候，罗马败落后所盛行的野蛮才会结束。”

“你真的能听得懂他说的是什么？”

“勉强可以听懂。他说的是拉丁语，我们学校的所有老师、牧师和学者都说拉丁语。我八岁的时候，父亲就给我请了老师，从那时候起，我就经常使用拉丁语。刚开始学的时候，我并不感兴趣，主要是它的语法规则太烦琐了，但当我知道拉丁语能够让我了解世界上最为高贵的社会时，就慢慢喜欢上它了。来这里上学这几个月，所有的课程都是用拉丁语讲的，我真希望自己也能流利地讲拉丁语。好在，大部分内容我都能听懂，虽然不是全部。”

“那为什么这个意大利诗人不在大学里演讲呢？”

“他可能，也许是——在一定程度上，他的演讲会引起人们的争执，因为很多老师不喜欢所谓的‘新学’。现在学校的教学方法都是从伟大的亚里士多德那里传下来的，可我们却从没有在最原汁原味的希腊文章中对他进行过了解，因为我们学的所有内容都是用拉丁语写的。老师们借鉴的都是几百年来积累下来的教学经验和相关文献，大多数人都不愿意改变他们的教学方式。”

此时，这位意大利学者开始用拉丁语念他自己写的诗歌。他刚刚念完，在人群的欢呼中，一名波兰学者就登上雕像底座，开始用波兰语朗诵自己写的作品。

“为什么他们不全都说波兰语呢？”埃尔兹别塔问道，“那样的话，人们就能听懂他们的话了。如果我是个诗人，我才不会用那种只有少数学者会用的语言写诗呢。我就描写波兰和这里的鲜花，我就写塔楼里的号手，还有瓦维尔山上的城堡背后的蓝天。说真的，我喜欢你所说的新学。”

约瑟夫微笑着，不知道怎么接话。

“而且，”她继续说道，“为什么女人不能像男人一样学习呢？为什么只有男人才能读到这些诗人和学者的作品呢？我也想读。”

她的一字一句说得很严肃，而且不无道理。约瑟夫开始只想一笑了之，但看到埃尔兹别塔一脸严肃，也正经起来。

“是啊，”他最后说道，“我也不知道你为什么不能像男人那样读书，但我从没见过女人上大学的。”

当约瑟夫和埃尔兹别塔穿过小巷从圣安街返回鸽子街的时候，他们并没有注意到，有两个人正躲在远处的一座房子后面，悄悄地谈论着。这两人的身材都不高，其中一人驼着背——说话的时候，把细长的手指放到嘴边，“嘘……那就是那个男孩。”

另一个人心里咯噔一声，迅速转过头来，疑惑地问道：“你说他是什么时候来的？”

那个驼背男人正是斯塔斯，看院子的妇人的儿子，他说了一个日期。

“一定是他，”另一个人激动地说，“那天见他的时候，他是一幅乡下年轻人的打扮，衣服也脏兮兮的，满身尘土。现在他穿上了天鹅绒，戴着学生的帽子，还挺像个贵族；不过我还能认出他的身形。你说他就住在你们楼上？”

“是的，姓科沃斯基。”

“哼……据我所知，他们应该姓恰尔涅茨基……现在，听我说——看见这块金子了吧？这可是真金，够你买不少佳肴美酒了。这就是给你的，你一个人的。”

当陌生人把金币放到他手里的时候，斯塔斯几乎要高兴地尖叫出来。

“不过，不要和任何人说起这件事，这是你和我之间的交易。我告诉你，等事成了，你还将得到更多金子。现在给我带路，告诉我他们住在哪里。”

他们一直跟踪着约瑟夫和埃尔兹别塔，直到他们进了院门。

“就是这里。”斯塔斯指着大门说道。

“太好了。现在，给我盯紧了，有什么事情及时向我汇报。每天下午三点我都在金象旅馆，不过，不要和那里的任何人说你要找我，你掌握的消息只能告诉我一个人。记住，今晚用灯笼照亮那个男人的脸。你会得到更多金子。懂吗？”

斯塔斯完全明白，只要一想到有大笔奖赏，他的肩膀似乎都要笑起来了。他走进院里，立刻回了自己的房间。

与此同时，另外一个人也迅速返回了旅馆。他在一张桌子前坐了下来，头脑中思绪飞舞，能够成功找到安德鲁先生一家真是超级幸运啊。这的确是幸运，因为就算在大街上和约瑟夫撞了个正着，他也绝不可能认出来。要不是斯塔斯说这个男孩的父亲只有夜里才出门，他根本就不会联想到许多个礼拜前的早上，在泥地里把他的马踹跑的那个男孩。而他自己就是那个自称斯蒂芬·奥斯特洛夫斯基的人。

那天他们发生冲突之后，这一家人就消失了——他坐在旅店思考着——无处可寻，好像是突然裂开了一道地缝，把他们一家吞没了。克拉科夫也有一些其他的姓恰尔涅茨基的人家，但都不符合这家人的情况——我差不多都要放弃找他们了，也就是要放弃一座城堡和无数黄金。当时伊凡亲口许诺过会有回报。我还回了一趟乌克兰，也没听到他们的音信。我的手下直到现在还骑行在各个城市搜索他们，也一无所获。同时，我收到了从某处传来的一些微小的明智的线索，就又回到这里。

他突然重重一拳打在桌子上，“人们叫我博格丹·格罗兹尼——恶人博格丹，”他恶狠狠地说道，“不过，恶人总得有头脑。既然我在一开始的时候就走了运，那最后也会圆满收场。等我拿到了我要找的东西，一定让那个白脸波兰人付出代价，以报那日在克拉科夫城门外的羞辱之仇。”他心里想到当时的情形，眼中浮现出恨意。

此时，他的注意力转移到一个脸上绑着脏兮兮的绷带的乞丐身上，这个乞丐正哀号着挨桌乞讨。

当乞丐靠近时，男人在乞丐伸出的手里扔了一枚硬币，低声说道：“你今天来晚了。”

“请原谅，主人。我以为我能打探到点什么消息呢。”

乞丐好像已经做好了挨揍的准备，做出防御的姿态，但男人只是微笑了一下。

“没关系，任务已经完成了。”他低声说着，“今晚，你就快马加鞭，赶到塔尔诺夫，召集你的弟兄们，让他们带上正在进行搜捕的人手。这大概得用三个礼拜时间——不过，一定要在初雪之前赶回来。”

乞丐收到命令，就又佯装着镇定的样子，如同进来的时候一样，缓缓走出了旅馆，蹒跚地向前走，直到拐进了市场西边的街道。他突然躲到一座房子的扶壁后面，扯掉脸上的绷带，全速向莫吉列夫路的城门跑去，以便在夜间换岗前顺利通过城门。

他出了城门，然后便悠闲地顺着路慢走，直到来到一户小农舍。农舍后面有一座马厩，他在那里找到了自己来克拉科夫时所骑的马。他跟农舍的主人只说了一个词，而对方似乎能全然明白他的行动，然后他便纵马飞驰向远处那座通往塔尔诺夫的桥。

旅馆里的那个男人继续思考着，“那个叫斯塔斯的驼背杂种简直就是我的福星。以前经常见他在这里和那些乞丐谈天说地，看见他的第一眼，我就知道他有一天能派上用场。所以，我让店家给他送上一杯酒，以示友好，然后和他攀谈起来，他就谈到了那个新来的吹号手白天从不出门！虽然那个男孩换上了天鹅绒的衣服，但我敢肯定他就是那家的孩子，他们一家人到达的日期也都能对上。今天晚上那个号手出门的时候，斯塔斯会用灯笼照亮他的脸，我会躲在附近，一探究竟——不过，这也没什么必要了，事情已经很清楚了。我的人一两个星期之内就进城了，然后一切就会很快结束了。”

想到这里，他的脸就兴奋得有些发白，脸上那块纽扣形状的疤像血块一样更加显眼。

“到时候看看那个尊贵的安德鲁先生会怎么说！”他想着想着，笑出了声——“他会知道在他的眼前是博格丹·格罗尼兹吗？因为，他，以及乌克兰的每个人，都认识纽扣脸彼得。我跟他们说我姓奥斯特洛夫斯基，这是个有身份的姓氏啊，是曾经在海乌姆把我当奴隶使唤的人家的姓氏。”

确实，纽扣脸彼得是乌克兰人人谈及色变的名字。波兰人都这么叫他，其实他的真名叫博格丹，哥萨克人都叫他格罗尼兹或者恶人。这个亡命之徒的父亲是哥萨克人，母亲是鞑靼人。过去的十年中，他参与了边境发生的所有阴谋事件，烧毁了大量的房屋，残忍地杀害了无数百姓。他在乌克兰还有一帮随叫随到的手下，随时受他的指使杀人放火。

甚至一些大人物也会找上门来，有波兰的，也有莫斯科的，他们委托他完成一些非法的勾当，一些贵族会雇佣他处理一些自己不敢亲自出面解决的事务，鞑靼的大汗甚至派他到金帐汗国执行一项秘密任务。他的名字在两国边境地区都很响亮，甚至波兰还有专门听他差遣的同伙。

如今，乌克兰这个伟大的国家——一百多年前，立陶宛的亚盖洛大公和波兰女王雅德维加的结合将乌克兰纳入了波兰的版图——而现在，这片广阔的土地在波兰和俄国的争夺下充满了阴谋和算计。莫斯科的伊凡大公早就开始觊觎这块地盘，因为在拜占庭时期，这里曾经是俄国的中心，基辅就是它的首都，他现在正计划着趁机从波兰手里把它夺走。就是在这种政治背景下，无数像安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基先生这样的无辜百姓一夜之间家破人亡，因为有许多像恶人博格丹——也就是波兰人所称的纽扣脸彼得——这样的人，为了赏钱时刻准备着烧杀抢掠。

然而此时，安德鲁先生一家正安静地享受着晚餐，他们完全不知道危险即将到来。





第九章　纽扣脸彼得的进攻


十一月下旬，严寒来临，波兰人称这个月为落叶月，乡下的穷人们早已在他们的木屋上加盖了茅草。人们在墙上抹了厚厚一层沙子，把所有透风的裂缝都用泥土、树枝或者石块填塞，还在桌子和板凳下面都堆满了柴火和木炭，在房梁上挂上一串串蔬菜干、蘑菇干和香肠。此时，家里养的鹅和猪还放养在外面，不过一开始下霜，它们便也得进屋，和人们共同住在茅屋宽大的“黑”房间里。茅屋里还有一个“白”房间，天气如果还不算太冷，人们就会住在这里，但有时候雪会下得没过屋顶，寒冷如此严酷，以至于晚上还能够听到树枝折断的声音，这时候所有人就会睡到“黑”房间里，为了保暖，那里连个给开放壁炉稳定排烟的烟囱也没有。

在城市里，富人们已经开始搭建意大利风格的高大壁炉，不过大多数人家还是靠开放式壁炉取暖。第一场霜冻降临那天，男孩们拿着生第一次火用的热煤球高兴地跑来跑去。圣玛利亚教堂塔楼上的守夜人，时刻都把眼睛睁得大大的，保持警惕，如果哪家的房顶冒起了火苗，他就得立刻发出警报。消防队长和他的队员们也在灭火中度过了无数个麻烦的夜晚。

十一月的最后一个礼拜三，一场小雪悄然而至。下雪的时候，安德鲁先生正要去教堂值夜班。目前他的生活一切顺利，他在黑暗中走在空无一人的街上，心里默默回想着这几个月来的生活：儿子在学校的学业突飞猛进，他的妻子每天过得快乐而满足，自己的收入也足够一家人舒舒服服地过日子，他心里现在就盼望早日把宝物敬献给国王。到现在为止，他始终都没机会觐见国王。这些日子，国王要么带着官员和军队忙于托伦的事，要么就在亚盖洛王朝的老家维尔纳（维尔纳现在由波兰统治着），要么就在鲁塞尼亚家族所在的狮城利沃夫。

而且国王就算到了克拉科夫，也不会停留很长时间，不论是安德鲁先生还是扬·康迪都很难得到接见，因为想要觐见国王的人已经排成了长队——要给国王敬献波希米亚皇冠的捷克使者、罗马来的代表团、意大利来的学者、请求共同抵制胡斯派的日耳曼骑兵代表，还有其他一些有头有脸的人物。

不过，安德鲁先生倒不担心时间的耽搁，因为觐见的事情已经定了下来。今年夏末，扬·康迪已经直接给国王送去了请愿书，国王也以书信方式给予了回复，信中说他会在来到克拉科夫的时候，最先接见这位温和的学者。而此时，那宝物正在安德鲁先生所能找到的最安全的地方藏着，没有危险。

在安德鲁先生离开鸽子街住处的几个小时之后，门外响起了一阵粗暴的门铃声，斯塔斯应声打开门，顺势用灯笼照亮了敲门人的脸。还没等他反应过来，一记耳光就朝着他的脸狠狠抽过来，把他打得踉踉跄跄，倒在已经开始覆盖所有东西的松软的雪里。

“你要是再敢这么做，我就要了你的命！”陌生人一边捡起掉在地上的灯笼，拉起瘫在地上的斯塔斯，一边咕哝着，“蠢货！你不知道有人会认出我的脸吗？要是巡夜卫兵抓住我的话，肯定也不会放过你。不要让任何人知道我来过，这是为了你好！一切都准备好了吗？”

“是的。”斯塔斯可怜兮兮地回答道。

“那告诉我，楼里都有什么人？”

“嗯——顶楼上住着一个人和他的侄女。那边是那个男孩和他的母亲。”

“那些学生呢？”

“他们到匈牙利学生宿舍讨论问题去了，一般天亮了才回来。”

“太好了！那我们的行动就无所顾忌了。我看，十二个人就够了，四个人到安德鲁的房间，四个人稳住其他的住户，如果有需要的话，剩下四个人守门。如果有卫兵经过，我们可以对付。”

“你看到楼梯了吗？”

“嗯，他们住在——”

“二楼。”斯塔斯在前面带路，两人登上了楼梯。陌生人感到脚下的楼梯有轻微的晃动。

“慢点，”他小声说道，“这楼梯好像一压就垮。”

正在此时，院子里的狗突然开始叫唤。

“那是什么东西？”陌生人吓了一跳，盘问斯塔斯，“你没和我说有狗啊！”

“不用担心，它锁着呢。”斯塔斯淡定地回答，然后问道，“现在能把金子给我了吗？”

“给！”陌生人不耐烦地扔给他几枚金币。他贪婪地接过金币，在黑暗中摸索着，因为陌生人从地上捡起灯笼之后，便一直把它藏在大衣下面。

“就这么点？”斯塔斯有些不满。

“蠢货！”陌生人突然爆发，“剩下的在这儿呢！”他挥起手，一把掐住了斯塔斯的喉咙，手指深深挖进他的肉里。斯塔斯努力挣扎，却无法摆脱他像铁爪一样的手。陌生人最后松开了手。

“下不为例！”陌生人警告道，“再不知好歹，就送你上天堂，或者让你下地狱！听着，蠢货！我再说最后一遍——如果事成了，我会给你现在酬金的双倍好处。要是你背叛了我，或者出了什么差池，你收到的就不是金子，而是你做梦也想不到的痛苦。”

斯塔斯不敢再多嘴，只是从楼上退下来，陌生人跟在他的后面。

“记住，”陌生人又一次警告说，“两点的钟声响过之后，我们就会到这里。把我们放进来，你的任务就完成了。”

那天晚上，炼金术士克鲁兹先生碰巧一个人待在他的阁楼里。他已经做完一项实验，正准备开始另一项稍微复杂的实验，突然听到院子里传来一阵狗叫声。

狗为什么要叫呢？他心里想着。今天没有月亮，这狗又不会朝着这里的住户乱叫。

他迅速盖上了阁楼的灯笼，打开门向楼下望去。

他认为院子里有问题的怀疑立马就得到了证实，他听到下面有人在低声地交谈着，楼梯也吱吱呀呀地响，好像有两个人正往上爬。接着，突然传来了一声痛苦的叫喊，他认定那是斯塔斯的声音。

然后又是一阵低语，之后就是下楼的脚步声。

他立刻前倾着身子，继续探听，正好听到了陌生人给斯塔斯的最后指示。

看来要发生什么冲突了，他心想着。看门人在深夜两点放进来的人，可不会是什么诚实体面的人。

他重新回到了阁楼，关上门，亮起灯笼，开始琢磨起自己所听到的内容。那个陌生人是谁？他在和看门人斯塔斯搞什么鬼？他该怎么做呢？他首先想到的是报告给夜巡队。

“我可能把事情想得严重了。”他做出了最后的结论，“深夜两点，可能没有我想的那么复杂。再说，就算真有人入侵，我自己也能给他一个下马威——”他扫视了一下自己的阁楼。这个想法让他有些兴奋，不禁笑出声来，不一会儿他又投入到了自己的工作中。

接下来的一个多小时，他全力进行自己的实验。这个实验复杂且要求严格，但他还是成功做完了，而且做了详细的记录。之后，他又想起了斯塔斯和他那位神秘的访客。在深夜的寂静中，这件事好像变得更加严肃。

突然，克鲁兹跳了起来，在火堆上架起两个火盆，然后在其中一个火盆中融化了一块橡胶，在另一个火盆中倒入了一些液体。十五分钟之后，他熄了火，取出了里面的物质，把它们混合在一起，然后用小刷子蘸取这份混合物，把它涂在挂在墙上的长袍上。之后，他取下做实验时所戴的防毒面具，也在上面抹上了这种混合物，里面的橡胶让它可以紧紧粘在面具上。

“我只要在上面涂上磷，”他自言自语地说道，“天空也不会比我更闪耀。”

弄完以后，他又坐回椅子里，闭着眼睛思考一切的缘由：“这么做有什么意义呢？那个陌生人和斯塔斯停在了安德鲁先生家住的平台上。这家人的背后到底藏着什么秘密？他们为什么更名改姓？谁会对这一家三口实施报复呢？埃尔兹别塔如今有了‘母亲’，我也有了朋友。他们家没有什么宝贝，也没多少钱，而且来这里的第一天安德鲁先生还不得不为了生计，卖了自己的马和车。”

他想着想着，越来越困，他今天工作太长时间了，而且也没怎么休息。正当他就要屈服于自己的疲倦时，他听到圣玛利亚教堂的钟响了两次，然后又响起了《海那圣歌》。还没等第四遍《海那圣歌》吹完，楼下就传来窸窸窣窣的声音。斯塔斯正沿着墙鬼鬼祟祟地走向大门，准备开门。炼金术士悄悄地打开阁楼的门，趴在地上，然后探着身子向外看。吱呀一声，门打开了，有人进来了。炼金术士仔细地听着下面的脚步声，默默地数着，一、二、三，还有更多呢！如果没听错的话，肯定有十二个人。看来没通知巡夜人，真是失误了。可就算我现在把他叫来，对方这么多人，对付我们两个也是绰绰有余。算了，既然是自酿的苦果，就得自己吃下去。

楼梯传来吱吱呀呀的响声，几乎同一时间，一阵狂野的狗吠声打破了寂静。

“让那条狗住嘴！”他听到下面有人低声说话，然后院子里又是一阵脚步声，应该有人到院子里对付那条狗去了。同时，他听到院门咣当一声关上了，然后是铁链锁门的声音。

是斯塔斯那家伙！炼金术士心里嘀咕着，他明天一定会为此付出代价！

下面突然传来一声痛苦的叫声。这不是狗叫，而是人的声音！哈！克鲁兹先生心想，“狼”把那人解决了。

接着是一个人穿过院子的声音。“我没办法靠近它！”他尽量压低声音朝着带队的人说道，“它把我的腿咬了，疼得我要晕了。”

“你们三个一起上！”那个头头指挥道。

下面又传来一阵扭打的声音，“狼”疯狂的嚎叫和几个人疼痛的惨叫混杂在一起，让夜晚充满了可怕的气息。此时，约瑟夫手里举着一盏灯，出现在二楼的门口。

“‘狼’！‘狼’！”他喊了两声。

之后，他再没有出声。

哦，炼金术士心想，这孩子的嘴也被他们捂住了，可能是给塞上了东西。

他猜对了。领头的人一把抓住了约瑟夫，给他的头上套了一个布袋。

“进屋！”他朝着下面的人喊道，“你们四个在那里守门，你们四个在楼梯口等着，不要让任何人下去，其他人跟我来！”

他举起从男孩手里抢过的灯笼，借着这个灯光，克鲁兹看到这个人的脸上有一块圆形的伤疤，看上去像是一颗巨大的纽扣。

“鞑靼人或者哥萨克人，”他心里一惊，“只有东边地区的瘟疫才会留下这种疤，看来这些人都是远道而来。”

没错！这帮人就是被波兰人称为纽扣脸彼得的恶棍带来的，他在乌克兰臭名昭著。

紧接着，彼得就带着三个人进了屋里。炼金术士听到一声女人的尖叫，然后是她被拉扯到地上的声音，家具被毁坏的声音，地毯撕扯的声音——这群家伙好像在疯狂地寻找着什么，把屋子翻了个底朝天。因为下面的房门是敞开的，所以炼金术士可以清晰地听到下面的声音。

“看看床上。”领头的人说道。

安德鲁先生和妻子睡前厅当中的一张大床。这群人挥起长剑，几下就把床上的东西砍成了碎片。他们划开枕头，扯开毛毯，把整张床完全毁了，终于发现了他们要找的东西。

“就是这个，”带头人喊道，“那个大包裹，裹着布的那个。”

他用剑一层层划破外面的黑布——碎布一片片地掉落在地上，他所苦心寻找的东西露了出来。他右手拿着，正准备带着宝贝冲出门去，突然传来一个刺耳的声音，尖声喊着：“我的金子！我的金子呢！”

彼得像闪电一样转过身，狠狠地骂道：“狗东西！”

他举起灯笼，灯光下露出斯塔斯的怪脸，他生怕自己拿不到赏钱，脸都吓得扭曲了。

“金子！我这就给你！”彼得被他的莽撞激怒了，喊道，“来人，把他扔到狗那里，然后随便扔给他一些金子！”

两个人上前抓住斯塔斯，但他并不乖乖就擒，而是疯狂地反抗着，在屋子横冲直撞。另一个人见势不妙，猛地把他撞倒在地，另外两人趁机从后面压到他身上。斯塔斯扭动着干瘦的身体，逃了出来，但又被暴徒们刚才搜索宝物时撞翻的桌子绊倒，他紧紧地抓住桌腿，胡乱地踢打着，张嘴乱咬，竭力反抗。彼得已经忍无可忍，他把宝贝放到地上，一把抓起了斯塔斯。

正当一群人拥过来的时候，斯塔斯灵机一动，挣脱一条腿，一脚踢翻了身后的灯笼。灯笼倒地的时候门也被撞开了，蜡烛掉了出去。不过，这帮恶棍几乎同时抓住了他，推着他出了门。

他们把斯塔斯带到栏杆处，正准备把他推下去，突然一个女孩在楼上尖叫起来。

“真是全都该死！”彼得把斯塔斯推到一边，气得喊道，“本来一切都很顺利，突然冒出了一个傻瓜和小孩，非得把死人也吵醒。快点——真是受够了，赶紧撤！”

他在黑暗中摸索着走到安德鲁的床边，摸着他这次偷袭所得的宝贝。正在这时，上面突然传来轰隆声，如雷声一般，随即门口闪过一道可怕的红光，似乎是从天而降，霎时间，整个院子都被照得通红。





第十章　魔鬼显灵


彼得冲到门口，站在那里，仔细察看外面的情况。

一个个红色的火球从阁楼的窗口喷出，然后在空中炸开，整个院子充满了火光。在火光中，彼得看见了他的手下的脸色：站在楼梯下面的四个人和守在门口的四个人，都带着满脸惊恐。那些原本抓着斯塔斯的人也已经害怕地退到了一边，而那个笨蛋斯塔斯抓住了拔腿逃跑的机会，连滚带爬地下了楼梯。

彼得久久地呆站在那里，一动不动。面对活生生的事物，他常常勇猛无敌，但面对这种超自然的情况时，他就是个懦夫。尽管身体发抖，但他知道自己要是还想领导这帮手下，就必须拿出勇气，于是他故意装出一副勇敢的样子，从二楼顺着台阶冲上三楼。他刚刚站稳脚，窗口就又飞出一颗炮弹。

“回来！回来！”他的手下在下面叫喊着。

“上来！上来！”他站在上面命令道，“你们怕什么？”

“魔鬼来了！”

彼得在黑暗中挥舞着他的哥萨克长剑，“上来！上来！你们这些胆小的畜生——上来！不然我让你们的脑袋搬家！上来，我说——给我上来！”

出于对他的害怕，站在二楼的三个人在胸口比画着十字，战战兢兢地跟在他的后面。

“我们已经拿到宝贝了，”靠彼得最近的人声音颤抖地请求着，“咱们逃走吧。这肯定不是人，这是魔鬼来了，要是一会儿恶魔都跑出来，我们就性命难保了。”

“恶魔？”彼得咆哮道，“胡扯！你们给我上来，像个男人！这根本不是魔鬼！只是个活腻歪的家伙！如果不把他除掉，他肯定会告发我们，我们肯定出不了城。”

“上去，”过了一会儿，他一边推着靠近楼梯的一个人一边命令道，“上去，看看上面有什么！”

那个人浑身颤抖地往上爬着，他相信这是黑暗力量在对付他们。

“门开着，”他低声报告，“里面没有光亮。”他下面的另一个人把这话传给了彼得。

“那就都给我上去！所有人都上去！”彼得命令道，“那就是一个人而已。割破他的喉咙，然后快点下来。”

其余的人鼓起勇气，进了阁楼。彼得等了几分钟就不耐烦了，自己也登上楼梯，进入阁楼。

“你们找到什么没有？”他不耐烦地询问着。

“什么也没有。”阁楼的角落里传来手下人模糊的回答。

“如果有人在这里，就给我说话！”彼得吼道，但他的声音很快就消失在安静的房间里，“如果我们找到了你，小心——”

他还没说完，一团红色的火球突然像晴空中的一道闪电一般，把阁楼照得透亮，一个怒气冲冲的鬼影出现在黑暗中。这个鬼影浑身冒火，带着一股硫黄和火光的味道，身上的衣服不断喷火，释放出绿色的烟雾。鬼影缓缓向前移动，右手挥舞着一个火红的权杖，好像是绿色的树枝烧着了一样炽热，权杖的一头还呲呲的喷射着火花。

这一切是如此突然，如此让人意想不到，在这漆黑的夜里，突然出现这么一个冒着火光的红色魔鬼，即使是彼得这样胆大的人，也被吓得尖叫起来，浑身抖动得像片风中的树叶。

连彼得都颤抖了，更不要说其他人了，他的手下一个个都吓疯了。“出去！快出去！”他们尖声喊着，一起拥向了楼梯口。

那个怪诞的魔鬼挥舞着权杖紧紧跟在他们的身后，在他们争先恐后往楼梯跑的时候，他用权杖轻巧地击打着一个又一个人。其中两个人一起冲到了楼梯，推推搡搡中，一起滚了下来，另一个人还没等这两个人站起身来也滚下了三层，压在他们身上。

站在楼梯口的彼得还想最后一搏，转过身喊道：“不论你是人是鬼，我都要看看你有什么能耐。”说完，他抽出长剑冲向这个奇怪的身影。魔鬼敏捷地躲过砍来的长剑，手向彼得的脸挥去。

“啊！啊！”彼得这个恶棍突然疼痛地叫出声来，一些令人窒息的粉末状的东西飞入了他的眼中和喉咙中，“救我啊！你们这帮胆小鬼！我被魔鬼抓住了！快点救我啊！喂！”

没有人回应他，外面只有他的手下从楼梯滚落的声音。

彼得捂着眼睛，跌跌撞撞走到楼梯处，摔下了楼梯，生怕魔鬼跟上来，再给他一把粉末。这个魔鬼跟在他后面，但并没有继续对他进行攻击。他跟在这些撤退的人们后面慢慢地走下楼梯，朝空中扔了几个小火弹，随着几声爆炸声，院子被绚烂的火焰照亮。

院子下面是震耳欲聋的嘈杂声。那只狗已经挣脱了盖在它头上的布袋，正在声嘶力竭地叫着。那帮恶棍害怕地大哭大喊，已经完全忘了不能惊动外人这回事。约瑟夫被绑着关在他们家的后屋，嘴被紧塞着，现在他脚上的绳子已经松动了，他正用力踢打着木板墙；埃尔兹别塔大声地哭喊着救命；周围的住户们从窗户探出头来张望。街上有人大声呼喊着巡夜的卫兵，而斯塔斯此时也摆脱了困境，不知道为什么突然开始疯狂地拉动门上的门铃，门铃声混在一片喧嚣中。

二楼的平台上，三个逃跑的人直接撞上了四个站在那里的人，差点把他们都撞下楼梯，摔到院子里。他们刚刚站稳脚跟，下层的楼梯由于这不寻常的压力已经吱吱呀呀响了，突然就崩塌了，把这一群人连带着摔到院子里，现场一片狼藉。彼得就跟在那三个人的后面，见此场景，便想轻巧地跳进安德鲁先生的住处，免得摔下去，但他身后的魔鬼依然气势汹汹地站在二楼上面的楼梯上，那里的柱子和台阶都很稳固。不过，不久魔鬼就不见了，因为就在彼得转身消失在屋里的时候，魔鬼也借着剩余的楼梯，脚一蹬，身子一跃，正好压在了彼得身上，然后一把抓起他扔到了安德鲁先生家前厅的地板上。

院子里已经乱作一团：横梁和从地面支撑楼梯的木头散落在地，人们害怕地尖叫着，两个人被压在倒塌的楼梯下面，痛苦地呻吟着。在下面守门的几个人吓得四处逃窜，一心想着在巡夜卫兵赶来之前逃出门去。

正当院子发生这一切的同时，用化学物质和各种粉末造成混乱局面的炼金术士，正挥舞着他沉重的权杖——一根涂抹了发光树脂的大棒——挥向此时正趴在地上的彼得，同时厉声问道：“说！你们在这里找什么？”

此时彼得已经重拾了一些勇气，而且这声音听起来更像是人而非魔鬼，就说：“我不告诉你！”

“说！”

“不说！”

“那我就把你交给卫兵！”

“我不怕！他们什么也得不到！”

“我先看看你的嘴脸！”

炼金术士骑坐在彼得的身上，一只手紧扣着他的喉咙，另一只手小心翼翼地从长袍里取出一个火球。他把火球按在地上摩擦，当火球燃着的时候，把它扔向石头壁炉。火光一闪，整个房间突然被照得和白天一样明亮。

然而，炼金术士并没有借着火光察看彼得的脸！他的注意力马上被房间里别的东西所吸引。那正是彼得从安德鲁先生的床里找到的巨大圆形物体——它就落在地上，离他们一臂之遥，在火光的照射下，它像上千个精美玻璃棱镜一般闪闪发光。

“哦！”他喊道，“原来是这个！强盗先生，看来你此行的目的并不寻常啊。你并不是简单的抢劫民宅，这……待着别动，否则我就掐破你的喉咙！”此时彼得正借着炼金术士注意力被新目标吸引的机会，试图摆脱压制。

“谁让你来的？”炼金术士问道。

彼得闭口不言。

“你必须得回答。听见下面的声音了吗？”

那是夜巡卫兵叫喊的声音，“站住！以国王之名命令你！”

现在，彼得完全镇定下来，因为他意识到他要对付的只是一个普通人，而不是魔鬼。他决定耍一些小伎俩。

“如果你帮我躲起来，我就告诉你。”

“我不能保证。不过，你得把你知道的告诉我。”

“那你看那个。”彼得扭动着被压着的一只手，好像要指向地上那个闪闪发光的物体，在即将烧尽的火球所发出最后的光线中，这个物体像一个小太阳一般闪耀。

“我看到了。”炼金术士看了一眼，然而，这瞬间的松懈是致命的，趁着这个机会，下方的彼得抽出了右手，挣脱开了炼金术士对他喉咙的控制。接着两人就厮打起来，炼金术士根本不是这个身手矫健的哥萨克人的对手。他们在地上来回翻滚着，胳膊紧紧扭在一起，撞断了桌腿，撞倒了书架上的陶器，碰到墙壁——在扭打的过程中，哥萨克人逐渐占据了上风，而起初是他的对手占优势。他先是像钳子一样用两条腿夹着克鲁兹先生的身体，这还是他以前在乌克兰学到的招数，接着，他的两只手都挣脱了克鲁兹的掌控，然后把对方的胳膊拧到了背后。他的力量越来越大，直到克鲁兹的骨头发出咔嚓的声音，然后他快速起身，调换了两人的位置，现在成了他在上方，炼金术士在下方。啪的一声！他用尽全力把克鲁兹的头猛磕到地上，这沉重的一击足以让一个巨人昏过去，然后他瞬间把对手扔向了墙壁。

炼金术士躺在了那里。

彼得像进攻的猎豹一样，敏捷地抓起他来此寻找的宝贝，跳向门口。

他并没有安然无恙地到达门口。克鲁兹先生也留了一手。他太幸运了，这个哥萨克人用力将他的脑袋撞到地上的时候，多亏他的面具帮他承受了大部分的冲击——否则他可能永远也醒不过来了。当哥萨克人把他扔到墙边的时候，他就假装昏死过去，然后在哥萨克人转身的时候，他敏捷地摸向他长袍的口袋，那里还藏着一小包炸药粉，只要稍一摩擦就能炸开。这包炸药在他们扭打在地的时候竟然没有爆炸，这也真是奇迹。

彼得跃向门口的时候，克鲁兹的右手已经握住了这包东西。再过一秒彼得就要消失了——炼金术士找到平衡，用尽所有力气扔出了炸药粉。

这一扔太准了！正好砸中哥萨克人的后脑勺，然后砰的一声爆炸了。

楼下的人早已注意到了二楼的骚动，他们听到一声响亮的爆炸声，之后院子被照得一片通明。耀眼的亮光中传来一声尖叫，传遍了院里的每一个角落。叫声刚落，一个男人，头发冒着火，身上的衣服已经被烧成一条一条的，跳出了安德鲁先生家的房门，跳到还未倒塌的楼梯边缘，向楼上冲去。他在那里稍作停留，快速看了一眼下面的情况。院子里火把闪烁，吵吵闹闹地挤满了人——学生、巡夜人和士兵都来了——看来要从下面逃跑是不可能了。他跳上了通往阁楼的楼梯，爬了上去。现在，他头顶的不远处就是房顶了，他两手搭在房檐上，向后荡开阁楼的矮门，等到门和房屋并排之后，借力登上了房顶。他沿着房顶像一颗流星一样猛跑，因为他燃烧的头发在他身后留下了一串火花——接着，他一跃跳上了邻近的房顶，然后又跳到另一个房顶，最后跳上一个靠着墙头的倾斜屋顶，消失不见了。

底下的人叫嚣着，但彼得已经逃走了。有人说看见他沿着墙头跳进了后面修道院的花园了，有人说他只是假装下去，实际上又偷偷爬上了房顶。无论如何，没人再发现他的踪影。

巡夜人费了半天劲，搭起了一架临时的楼梯，救出了被捆绑在小房间的约瑟夫母子，并把埃尔兹别塔带到他们身边。克鲁兹已经回到了他的阁楼，他脱掉破损的长袍和面具。这场搏斗让他鲜血淋漓，身体虚弱，他一头栽倒在床上。人们都以为这帮强盗没能得逞，什么也没能带走，但当安德鲁第二天早上回来的时候，把整个房子找了一遍，却发现那件宝物不见了。目击者声称彼得顺着屋顶冒险逃跑的时候根本拿不了任何东西，也有人说看到他当时两手空空。

不过，不论他们怎么找，宝物已经不见了，尽管目击者的说法不无道理，但安德鲁还是确信强盗偷走了宝物。

彼得的一些手下在楼梯坠落时受了伤，没能趁机逃跑，最终被关进了监狱，判以各种刑罚。有好几个被关进了地牢，在那儿他们再也不能作恶；有两个人被判处流放“九十九年”；其余的被遣返回其他的地方进行审判，因为他们在那些地方有前科。不过，动用最为严酷的审问也无法从他们那里得到重要信息，他们也不知道这个头领为什么要对安德鲁一家下手。

再说说斯塔斯，在他做出背叛行为之后，他母亲就和他断绝了关系，立刻把他赶出家门，不准他再回来。听人说，他在不久之后到金象旅馆当了伙计，但在一次顾客被抢劫的事件之后，他就消失了，再也没人听到他在克拉科夫的消息。

对于说出自己在事故中的经历，克鲁兹先生虽然有些缺乏勇气，但第二天一早他就来到安德鲁先生的住处，尽可能完整地向他描述了前一天夜里那件事以及那位领头人的样子。他还没说完，安德鲁就气愤地站起身来，一拳打在椅背上。

“果真如我所料！”他愤怒地说道，“这个人之前已经攻击了我两次。现在我确定他就是那个自称博格丹的蒙古和哥萨克混血！哥萨克人都叫他恶人博格丹。他的恶行我都听过很多次了，我们乌克兰的每一个人都多次听说过他干的坏事。他对我的这种恶行完全符合他的风格！他简直就是个魔鬼，心狠手辣，照我说，他就是所有上帝赐予生命的人之中最胆大妄为的人。我们这些乌克兰的波兰人都叫他纽扣脸彼得，因为他的右脸颊上有一块疤，你也看见了。要不是因为我单纯地以为他只在边境地带搞非法活动，他在城门外攻击我的那天早上，我肯定就能认出他来。”

说完，他就悲伤地走开了，去修理那些被那帮哥萨克狂徒损坏的家具。





第十一章　进攻教堂


在乌克兰的冬天，人们若从一户人家去另一户人家，就会骑矮马，这些马可以把尖尖的鼻子探到雪地里，吃到大草原上被雪覆盖的干草。传言，那个在第聂伯河和伏尔加河沿岸被称为恶人，被波兰移民称作纽扣脸彼得的博格丹和以前不一样了。他变得消沉，不再似过去那般狂暴，不过这并不是因为他丢了很多头发——某些人在背后叫他“烧焦的头发”博格丹——而是之前的几次失败让他意志消沉，好几个月闭门不出。当他最终回归人们的视野，出现在小酒馆的时候，他的头发已经长到和以前差不多的长度了，被火灼伤所留下的巨大疤痕也几乎愈合了。在此期间，他好像还专程去了一趟莫斯科公国，面见了伊凡大公，但对于此事，他自己并没有声张，而别人也不敢多问。

一四六二年的三月，春天来了，第聂伯河的两岸一片祥和，只是到处都有一些正在远征的部落，或者有鞑靼人发动突袭。春天一来，恶人博格丹又开始行动，跟着他的还有一批在乌克兰恶名昭著的冷血杀手和强盗。他们先是跑到“平原小镇”罗夫诺，紧接着又越过布格河到海乌姆的边境作乱。有一段时间他们为了进行劫掠，甚至直接驻扎在卢布林的森林里，后来听到风声说有军队在追剿他们，就消失在北边的沼泽地，之后就不再有人听到他们的消息。

似乎彼得一开始并不赞成这种打砸抢烧，他还有其他的事情要做，但他带的这帮人都是野蛮的部落人，他们以抢劫盗窃为乐，渴望获得利益。

在塔尔诺夫的时候，他把这帮人重新召集起来，组成了一个亚美尼亚地毯商队，带领他们，赶着马车驶向欧洲东部最大的市场克拉科夫。到了克拉科夫以后，他们在布楼东边的广场卸下货物，安营扎寨。

此时，克拉科夫城最悲伤的人莫过于安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基先生了——他丢了原本要献给波兰国王的宝物，虽然这不是他自己的过失，但这个宝物是如此宝贵，很多人都对它垂涎已久。扬·康迪也来安慰他，他的妻子、儿子还有埃尔兹别塔都费尽心思让他从丢失宝物的沉重心情中跳出来，但是每当漫漫长夜，他孤身一人在塔顶值班的时候，就会被抑郁的情绪所吞没。

约瑟夫了解父亲的心情，所以只要有空就陪父亲一起去值班。而且快要放假了，第二天早上学校也没什么课。他和父亲通常晚上十点出门，一直在教堂待到第二天早上。有时候约瑟夫会在他父亲休息的时候接过守夜的任务，每个小时吹奏四次《海那圣歌》，然后从塔楼的各个窗户监视整个城市的情况，以便在发现任何火舌跃向天空的时候，及时拉响报警的钟声。约瑟夫的吹号技术日益精湛，已经和他父亲吹得一样好了。

彼得和他的商队在教堂下方的广场扎营的这天晚上，约瑟夫和父亲就在塔楼值夜班。天上挂着一轮满月，教堂的塔楼在街上和市场上投下长长的影子。教堂门口，一个守门人一手提着灯笼，一手拿着长戟，在整点钟声敲响后，按照习惯，一边喊着时间，一边走来走去。

守门人已经喊过了一点。此时的纽扣脸彼得正在广场的另一侧，从货车里注视着这一切，他决定动手了。

“迈克尔，”他低声叫道，“迈克尔。”他叫了两声之后，一个身穿皮衣，戴着皮帽，脚踩厚底鞋的男人从后面的货车钻了出来。他脱去了之前假扮成亚美尼亚商人时所戴的圆帽和披肩，走起路来好像一直不停地扭动着身子向前滑行——实际上，他在乌克兰的外号就是“蛇人”——他在彼得的马车前面站了一会儿，等他的老大在他耳边悄悄地下命令。

之后，就像他的外号一样，他蠕动着身子，从十二辆马车下面爬过，经过离教堂不远的一座房子，躲在广场角落的一棵大树后，等待随时发动攻击。他弯着身子，等待着看门人经过教堂前面。他没有等很长时间。

不久之后，教堂的阴影里突然出现一个人，手里提着的灯笼投射出一片星形的光影。这个人检查了一下通往吹号手塔楼的门，确认门已锁紧后，打了个哈欠，然后又用手中的长戟戳了几下门口的砖石，像是实在没什么事干似的。蛇人仔细地打量着这个对手，这人已过中年，皮袄外面穿着一件轻薄的铠甲，做工较差，边缘尖尖的，像一条短裙，正好垂到膝盖下面。腰部上方的盔甲链略有些重，这条链子延伸到肩膀，又绕过肩膀像袖子一样拖到手腕，然后又绕过脖子，连接到盖在头上的像帽兜一样的东西上，外面还戴着一顶粗糙金属制成的尖顶头盔。在铠甲的外面他还穿着一件短皮马甲，腰上系着一条皮带，上面别着一把短刀，肩头处还有一条皮带，左侧还有一个用来支撑和平衡长戟的带扣。

他从教堂前面向南边走去，一边仔细地观察街上或者广场上是否有人，不过街上一个人影也没有。于是，他转身走进了教堂南边的墓地，月光轻盈地洒在那里古老的墓碑上。他在其中一块墓碑的后面蹲下身来，把长戟和灯笼分别放在左右两侧的地上，然后在胸前画了一个十字，好像是请求这里的灵魂原谅他打扰了他们休息。随后，他从腰间的口袋取出一块硬面包和一大块肉放心地吃起来，毫不担心会有人打扰。

看门人这么做也合情合理，多年来他一直都是这样的，教堂也没什么重要事情，只是节日的时候，会有调皮的年轻人捉弄看门人，不过他很容易就能把他们打发了。这个时候，小偷也很少光临教堂，而且在那个充满迷信的时期，墓地本身就足以起到保护作用，强盗也不敢来。塔楼上有吹号手严格监视着，整个城里也都有巡夜人关注每家每户的情况，盘问夜间出行的路人。

“哈——啊！”他打了一个哈欠。生活是如此宁静！

此时，一个人正贴在教堂的高墙后面，如果守门人能够注意到他的话，肯定就不会有这种悠闲的叹息了。蛇人已经迅速看清了眼前的情况，他趁着守门人背对广场的机会，飞冲到了拱壁的阴影下面。他沿着墙壁小心翼翼地向前移动着，现在离守门人所在的墓碑仅仅几步之遥。

扑通一声！蛇人像是老鹰袭击耗子一般猛扑上去。

一个是蓄势待发，一个是毫无防备，所以两人之间连打斗也没有。守门人背朝下倒在了墓碑的边上，身手敏捷的蛇人迈克尔已经用头巾紧紧地勒住了对方的嘴，让他无法发出任何声音。然后，他迅速从上衣里取出短绳，捆住守门人的手脚——他原本想要用剑割断这个人的喉咙，但担心守门人会发出垂死的惨叫，从而打乱整个计划，就作罢了。

他在守门人的皮马甲里找到一把巨大的铜钥匙，把它从链子上割了下来，然后塞进了自己的腰带。

他确认捆绑得结实之后就飞身跑进教堂的阴影，悄悄回到了他主子的马车那里，动作和刚才出来时一样敏捷。

“我把那个守门人捆起来了，也堵上了他的嘴，把他扔在墓地了，”他报告着，“这是上塔楼的钥匙。”

彼得的命令悄悄地传给了每一辆马车。接着，所有人都脱下披风和圆帽，换上了皮衣、皮帽、紧身裤和软皮靴，准备就绪后站在马车后面，等待着彼得的指挥，实施他那精密的计划。

车队距离塔楼只有很短一段距离，彼得带路，贴着地面走在塔楼投下的阴影中。最后，这一帮人——大约二十个左右——停在了塔楼和教堂之间的隐蔽处。

“跟紧我，”彼得说道，“上楼梯的时候，小心脚下有松动的木板。那个男孩今天也和他的父亲在塔楼里。上楼小心点。等我发令，你们就冲上去抓住那父子俩。”

说完他把迈克尔从守门人那里偷来的钥匙插进锁孔，推开了小铁门，然后不得不弯着身子走了进去。

“轻点，”他悄悄说道，“跟紧了。”

不一会儿，所有人就都进了门，最后一个人按照指示，又把铁门关上，这样就算有好奇心重的路人想进来看看，也只能看到这门像往常一样关着。

“任务很简单，”彼得带着手下登上通向塔楼简易楼梯的狭窄石阶悄声说道，“我们现在就是去把兔子抓进袋子里，但你们必须要让这兔子安静。如果他拉动了钟绳，警钟就会响起，全城的人就会被吵醒。所以，一定要快速制服他。”

他们一直向上，悄悄地爬上绕着鹰架的楼梯，盘旋而上，每一步都走得特别小心，不让任何一块木板发出声音。最后，彼得停了下来，轻声说道：“前面就到了。”

塔楼房间的门敞开着，里面突然传出了约瑟夫的声音，“父亲，您接下来就休息吧！我来负责每个小时吹《海那圣歌》，沙漏的时间很好看懂，我肯定不会出错的。”

能赶上这父子俩一起值班的晚上也是幸运，彼得想着。我们可以把老的捆住，然后让小的带路去拿宝物。

约瑟夫已经在眼前的桌子上铺开了手稿，把细蜡烛挪到眼前准备阅读，正在此时，他突然听到门外有动静。他猛地转过身，恰好看到门被粗暴地撞开，然后进来三个人径直冲向他，他还没来得及防备就完全被制伏了。其中一个人像把钳子似的，紧扣住了他的手臂，另两个人冲向安德鲁先生，他刚从小床上坐起来，吃惊而迷茫。

还有一个人站在门口，双手搭在腰上，高兴地放声大笑。“哈哈哈！快乐歌唱的鸟儿呀！”他说道，“我们又见面了，在这远离世间喧嚣的塔顶，没人会来打扰我们的。”说着，他的脸色一沉，问道，“知道我为什么来吗？”

约瑟夫心里咯噔一下。这个人就是他们来克拉科夫第一天时他父亲碰上的那个男人，那个在广场上煽动人群向他们扔石头的人。在他手脚被绑，人被扔在小屋地上时所听到的就是这个人的声音。同时，他开始琢磨这个男人为什么会回来？在第一次危险尝试之后，他不是已经冒险把宝物夺走了吗？难道他要为那天马车的事情，来向父亲报仇？

想到这里，约瑟夫动了一下，像是要画个十字祈祷一下，因为他们现在位于城市的上空，要想把人从这里扔到下面的墓园，简直轻而易举，恐怕天亮以后才会有人发现殒命的受害者。

相比之下，安德鲁先生反而要平静许多。“不知道，”他沉着地说道，“我不知道你为什么来这里，但我知道你是谁，纽扣脸彼得，有时也叫博格丹，那天早上你威胁我的时候，我竟然没有认出你，还真是奇怪。”

彼得根本不在乎安德鲁后面所说的话，他只听到了一个否定的回答。显然，这不是他想要的答案。

“你不知道？胡说！……你以为我不知道吗？”彼得挤进屋里，把蜡烛举到安德鲁的脸跟前，“告诉你！我来就是要拿走我想要的东西，我也有的是办法！我手下的这些人都可以要了你的狗命！过来，如果你还想留着你这层皮，就告诉我，你把那个塔尔诺夫水晶球藏哪儿了？”

约瑟夫心头一颤。这个人说的就是他们从乌克兰带来的宝物，那个水晶球，塔尔诺夫大水晶球。因为它的丢失，他父亲已经难过很长时间了。但一颗水晶球怎么会引起人们如此高度的重视呢？如果这是一颗钻石或者宝石的话，人们对它艳羡也合情合理，但这只不过是一颗水晶球啊，为什么呢？约瑟夫知道乌克兰有许多洞穴，可以从那里的墙上敲下许多水晶。或许这个水晶球有什么特殊的价值。

“你比我清楚，”安德鲁先生回答，“你偷袭我家住处的那天夜里，它就消失了。如果不在你手里，那我也不知道到哪儿去找。”

“它消失了？”彼得先是一惊，但随后又开始怀疑，“撒谎！”他尖声说道，“撒谎！它还在你手里。我有办法……过来！”他把蛇人迈克尔叫过来，命令道，“带这个男孩到他们的住处去，用刀逼着他的喉咙。我来守着这个老家伙，但如果你在一刻钟之内不回来的话，我就干掉这个波兰人。不，”他突然说道，好像改变了主意，“我亲自带这个小畜生去。我们在外面的时候，你就把刀抵在这个老狐狸的喉咙上。如果这男孩带错了路或者是出卖我，我就割破他的喉咙。要是我们在一定时间之后还没有带着水晶球回来，就按照我之前说的干掉这个家伙。”

这个哥萨克人坚信，安德鲁先生一定会为了他们父子俩，特别是他儿子的性命而放弃水晶球，但他没想到安德鲁竟然否认自己拿着水晶球，这让他万分苦恼。不过，他很快就摒弃了这个想法。安德鲁肯定在说谎，只要不出意外，不久之后，他就能拿到水晶球了。约瑟夫或许不知道水晶球藏在哪里，但他知道如果他带不回水晶球，留在塔楼里的人就会杀了他的父亲，为了救出他的父亲，他和母亲一定会快点找到水晶球。彼得也想过安德鲁先生可能会把水晶球藏到其他地方，不过如果在他家里找不到，他们就回来对他严刑逼供。

“等一下，”抓着约瑟夫的人刚把这个男孩交到他的手里，彼得突然说道，“桌上的沙漏显示两点到了，该吹号了，否则会有人怀疑出了什么事情，然后来一探究竟……你，小孩，我知道你也吹号。让你吃惊了吧？彼得到处都有耳目。出发去取宝贝之前，先把墙上的铜号拿下来……不，等一下，你先过来。”

他把约瑟夫拉到外面的钟绳旁边，监督着他。

“敲两次钟，然后拿下铜号，对着四个窗口吹奏《海那圣歌》。”

他小心地监视着约瑟夫，手中握着明晃晃的刀。约瑟夫拉了两次钟绳，带动锤子撞击大钟。

“和平时一样吹，别耍花招。”

约瑟夫回到号手的小屋，取下铜号，此时他想起了另一个年轻的号手，他曾经站在老塔楼上的相同位置，在履行职责的时候被一箭射中而倒下。有趣的是，约瑟夫也要在类似的处境中展现出勇气。他心里最初的恐惧已经消失，心中感到一种与生俱来的坚定，这是波兰人最为突出的性格特质。或许是因为联想到那个号手的事情给了他启发，他将铜号伸出西面窗口的时候，回想起了他那天和埃尔兹别塔的对话。那天，他开了一个关于《海那圣歌》的玩笑，但她把玩笑当作了童真的秘密——上帝保佑，他确信她会记得那个约定。

这个希望立刻在他心里升腾。他知道两点的时候埃尔兹别塔会是醒着的，她知道约瑟夫会在这时候接替他父亲吹奏《海那圣歌》，而且如果约瑟夫一鼓作气吹完曲子，在音乐末尾多吹了两三个音符，而不像通常那样在突然中止的音符处停顿下来，那就是出事了。那她要怎么做呢？她的叔叔沉浸于自己的实验中，肯定会笑话她胡思乱想。大半夜她敢出去找扬·康迪吗？如果她去了，扬·康迪一定会召集巡夜卫兵救他父亲的。他心里深切地感到，即使拿到了宝物，彼得也会杀了他们父子俩。

现在只能孤注一掷了。只是，彼得是否知道鞑靼人入侵时《海那圣歌》结尾那个中断音符的故事？只能祷告上帝他不知道这个故事。约瑟夫正嘴里祷告着，就听到彼得说：“你快吹啊！”

约瑟夫举起铜号。

他感到自己仿佛经历过那一幕似的。突然，他脚下的世界好像完全变了，宏伟的石砌建筑变成了木结构，四周一片火海，身材矮小、面貌丑陋的鞑靼人正骑着矮马，气势汹汹，近在咫尺处，一个人跨下马，从肩上取下弓并从箭筒中抽出一支铁头箭，弯弓，铁箭飞出。

约瑟夫吹响了铜号。

彼得点着头。《海那圣歌》对他来说并不陌生，他知道男孩是在按常规吹奏——不过，他只知其一，不知其二。在吹到曲子平常终止的地方时，约瑟夫犹豫了一下——这次他多吹了三个音符，吹出了完整版的《海那圣歌》。吹出这几个音符需要巨大的勇气，因为他知道哥萨克人的匕首随时都有可能割破他的喉咙。吹完后，他放下铜号，看了看周围人的反应。

血液轰地一下涌上了约瑟夫的头顶，不过那个哥萨克人正满意地点着头。看来他不知道《海那圣歌》结尾的故事！

约瑟夫又分别来到南面、东面和北面的窗口，像刚才那样吹奏了几遍！

“现在，赶快带我们去你家！”

彼得吩咐手下看管好安德鲁，说完就一把抓住约瑟夫的手臂，推搡着他走下楼梯。广场上一个人影也没有，他们悄悄地走在阴影里，朝着大学区的方向走去。彼得心里暗喜，他觉得自己的计划进行得很顺利，一边走一边用眼睛搜索周围僻静的角落，好在拿到水晶球回塔楼的路上用他的匕首干掉约瑟夫。然后，再解决掉塔楼里的安德鲁，这样就没人告发他们了。第二天，他们的亚美尼亚商队就可以堂堂正正地出城去。





第十二章　埃尔兹别塔没听到中止音


就在这个多事的夜晚刚来临的时候，一个女孩的身影从炼金术士克鲁兹三楼的房间出来，悄悄地顺着楼梯跑到了安德鲁先生家所在的二楼。她轻敲了三次门，等了大概一分钟后，门打开了一点，约瑟夫的母亲透过门缝小心地向外瞧着。

“进来吧，孩子。”认出是埃尔兹别塔后，她热情地说道。

“你怎么这么晚过来了？”安德鲁太太把沉重的门闩放回原处，把门锁好后，问道，“那个学生特林最近又在麻烦你和你叔叔了吗？还是有别的事情？先在桌边坐下吧，我正在做白天剩下的针线活呢，给我讲讲到底是怎么回事吧。”

“嗯，”埃尔兹别塔回答说，“都是那个学生特林。他和我叔叔现在就在阁楼里，我有些害怕——今天晚上，他们的对话比过去更奇怪。”

“今晚你就和我睡吧，”安德鲁太太说道，“你叔叔这样的学者竟然和特林那样的人打交道，真不是什么好事。我很怕那个学生，我感觉他像个返老还童的人，他那双深黑色的眼睛在看人的时候，好像总是在琢磨着可怕的事情。”

“我要留在这里，真是太好了，妈妈。”埃尔兹别塔高兴地说道，这几个月的亲密相处中，女人和女孩之间的感情就像母女一样亲，“但是，我并不是害怕那个学生特林，而是我叔叔这几个礼拜的举动让我担心，更确切地说，自从有人闯进院子偷东西的那天晚上之后，他就像变了一个人似的。”

“我也发现了，”安德鲁太太接着她的话说道，“他对你不好了吗？”

“哦不！我叔叔一直都对我很好！但他和我们刚来这里的时候完全不一样了。那时候他总是很快乐，和我说说笑笑，总会带我出去看看我俩都喜欢的东西。可现在他好像不怎么关心我了，整天昏昏沉沉的，有时候我和他说话，他就像没听见一样。有时候，他也会回答我的问题，可总是说些我听不懂的怪话。我真怕他是不是中邪了，被什么邪恶东西给迷惑了。”

“这肯定和那个特林有关。”

“对，我觉得主要就是因为他。他俩天天晚上都一起在上面的阁楼里做实验。我能听到他们偶尔走动，但有时候又是一片可怕的寂静。”

“我的好孩子，”女人暂时放下手中的针线，“这里永远都是你的家。遇上烦心事，你随时都可以过来……你可以睡那张小床……我们也总是遇到麻烦事，这你也许都知道。自从那个可怕的夜晚之后，安德鲁先生也变了。如果用心感受，其实我们已经拥有了所有让人快乐的事情：孩子、爱、食物，还有房子——为什么人总是叹息，非要追求那些自己没有的东西呢？”

“我们以前是多么快乐啊，”埃尔兹别塔又接着说道，“我感觉那个特林好像掌握着一些我叔叔难以抵抗的魔力。”

“上帝保佑，”安德鲁太太喊出声来，比画了一个十字，“那你知道他们在阁楼上干什么吗？”

“不知道，”女孩耸了耸肩膀，“应该是件可怕的事情。他们今晚见面时，说话的方式就很奇怪，让我很害怕，之后他们的谈话比以往任何时候都更加疯狂。我叔叔一直在说‘这会把我逼疯的！’然后特林又和他说‘这不会带来任何伤害，再试一次。’之后又是一片沉默，然后我叔叔还说了一些短促的胡话。吓得我就跑下来了。”

“可怜的孩子。”

“就在我下楼之前，我听见特林像是对仆人一样跟我叔叔说话。而我叔叔并没有生气，而且似乎还尽力取悦特林。最后特林还说‘你现在必须这么做，你必须要掌握把铜块变成金子的秘密，只要有了金子，你就有能力做任何事。你可以周游世界，看遍一切，你可以跟随著名的大师学习，能买到所有喜欢的东西。’他一遍又一遍地重复着‘金子’这个词。在他说话的时候，我叔叔默不作声，我感觉他应该是在做实验。”

安德鲁太太摇了摇头。“我听说有人尝试过用贱金属炼金，但结果都不好……”说完，她觉得不能再让埃尔兹别塔思考这些难题了，于是说道，“这几天约瑟夫和他父亲晚上都不在，我常常感到孤独。不过，我经常会听教堂塔楼吹号的声音，那样就知道他们安然无事。”

“我也是。约瑟夫两点的时候开始吹号。我和约瑟夫之间有个秘密，我总是会听他吹号。”

“天啊，孩子。你是说你每天夜里两点还醒着吗？”

“嗯，只要是约瑟夫吹号，我就会听。他是我最好的朋友，朋友之间应该忠诚。”

“你能听出约瑟夫和他父亲分别在什么时候吹号吗？”

“一开始的时候，我轻易就能分出来，现在就有些难了，不过，我觉得即使不知道他们分别在什么时候吹号，我也能分辨出来。约瑟夫吹得没有他父亲吹得响亮，不过已经吹得越来越像他父亲了。”

她们又谈了些其他的事情，一直聊到深夜。最后，安德鲁太太在安德鲁父子俩搭起的小沙发上铺好了床，让埃尔兹别塔睡在上面。小沙发离房门不远，就放在窗户下方，窗上挂着帘子，这几天天气好，窗户就一直开着，埃尔兹别塔能清楚地听到外面的声音，尤其是教堂的钟声和号声，因为窗户就正对着塔楼的方向。约瑟夫的母亲回到了里面的房间，约瑟在教堂的时候，她就睡在那里。埃尔兹别塔担心叔叔会突然来叫她，就没有脱衣服，直接躺在沙发上，准备睡觉。

埃尔兹别塔难以入睡，脑海总是浮现着他叔叔遇到坏事的画面，那个学生特林也让她心神不宁，思绪就如同沸水一般翻滚着。她不断想起人们的议论，学生们指指点点，街头巷尾的人们都说克鲁兹正在研究可怕的黑魔法。

在那个迷信的时代，人们相信邪恶的力量可以附到人的身上，让人做些黑暗的事情。他们相信死者的灵魂一直都徘徊在某些没人的地方，回答人们不会解答的问题。要是在路上遇到一只黑猫，就会面临厄运；如果一只猫头鹰午夜时分盘旋在废弃教堂的塔顶，那就是有巫师正骑着扫帚或树枝穿过天空；如果有狗在深夜嚎叫，就暗示附近有人要死了。

还有些人为了个人的利益，故意散布迷信的说法。这些人主要是巫师和魔法师，他们通过给容易上当的人们算命或者消灾骗取钱财。他们中一些人自以为诚实，但是大部分都是彻头彻尾的骗子。他们穿着黑袍，用一些见不得人的办法吓唬那些迷信的人，让他们破财免灾。这些魔法师兜售“符咒”，声称可以让人免受厄运。据说，小黑石球可以让人不被蛇咬；那种闪电击中沙滩融化了某些物质后所形成的黄色玻璃一样的物质也有很高的价值，说是碾碎了内服，能预防胃病，装到小包挂到脖子上还能躲避闪电；从猫狗和兔子身上取出的小骨头也有特殊的功效；还有青蛙的心脏也有神秘的作用等等。

再说炼金术士克鲁兹，很明显他正在进行的工作不仅损坏他的健康，而且损害他的神志。他这样身体强壮、思维理智的人发生了如此巨大的变化，肯定是不正常的。埃尔兹别塔躺在那里，思绪万千，整个人都被纷繁的恐惧所占据。她担心她叔叔已经不再是他自己灵魂的主人了，他的灵魂已经被特林所控制，特林在他的研究中有所发现，但为了这些发现，他利用了那个原本是他老师的人。

她想着想着，一点的号声已经吹响了，但她还是无法入睡。她对叔叔和特林的担心变成了天马行空的想象，她脑海中的人影已经扭曲变形，失去了正常的比例。那些生病的人或是心事重重的人，在身体疲惫、昏昏欲睡而大脑却因为担心而高度活跃的时候，就常常出现这种幻觉。她叔叔的样子刚才还和平常一样，一会儿就缩成一团，一会儿又突然变成庞然大物。那个特林一会儿是个学院学生的样子，一会儿又变成了顶着南瓜头的怪物，他的身子越变越大，整个天空都被他黑暗的影子所填满。他们两个人从事各种坏事：他们从篮子里放出许许多多用旧鞋变出的蝙蝠；他们跳到空中捕捉老鹰之类的大鸟，然后把它们关在阁楼的屋顶下；他们把冒着泡泡、嘶嘶作响、浮着泡沫的灼热液体混合起来——他们在同一时间进行着上千件事情，所有的事情都是邪恶的。几乎一个小时了，这些迷糊中出现的幻影一直在埃尔兹别塔的脑海里跳来跳去。突然塔楼上的钟响了两次。

“两点了。”她马上打起精神，脑海中混乱的幻象一下子烟消云散了。

《海那圣歌》吹响了。这是约瑟夫在吹号呢，她心想着。

她哼着旋律，几乎一个音符一个音符地跟着约瑟夫的号声——到了曲子该停的地方，她停了下来，等着约瑟夫从第二扇窗户吹奏。但是就在下一瞬间，她无比吃惊地意识到，约瑟夫并没有在《海那圣歌》结尾处的中止音停止吹奏，而是又多吹了几个音符，使这首小颂歌以其他音乐一样的方式结尾。

埃尔兹别塔挺直身子坐在床上，她觉得这有可能是迷糊的脑袋在和她开玩笑。“或许是因为我还没有完全清醒，”她心想着，“他吹第二遍的时候我得仔细听听。”

约瑟夫开始从南面的窗口吹奏。这次埃尔兹别塔没有提前哼出曲子，而是仔细地跟在每一个音符的后面。曲子结束后，她意识到第二次约瑟夫也没有在中止音处停下，而是继续吹奏几个音符，让《海那圣歌》听着像一首完整的曲子，而不是中间断掉的乐章。

“他吹得不对。”埃尔兹别塔自言自语地说着。

接着是朝着东边吹奏，但是这次风把铜号声吹远了。最后的一次号声在北面的窗口吹响，号声清晰地传到埃尔兹别塔的耳边。“这次我就能确定了。”她说。

开始的时候，她以为约瑟夫会在中止音处停下，因为号声在那里犹豫了一下，但之后，号声继续响起，仿佛在说：“我知道应该在这里停止，但我不能停。”然后又加上了几个音符，完成了整首曲子。如果故事中的那个年轻吹号手没有被鞑靼弓箭手射中的话，他就会这样吹出完整的《海那圣歌》。

埃尔兹别塔跳下床，站了起来……约瑟夫是故意这么吹奏的！他是个称职的号手，绝不可能三次都犯同样的错误！

可是——这是什么意思呢？约瑟夫遇到了危险吗？但教堂有警钟呢，只要敲一下，整个城里的人都会很快醒来。遇到城里起火、外敌入侵、防御以及暴乱、外国国王访问、战争等各种大事的时候，教堂的钟声都会响起呀——

约瑟夫绝不是那种把神圣的《海那圣歌》拿来消遣的人——那么，为什么？为什么？为什么他不拉动警钟呢？

答案只有一个！在《海那圣歌》第一次响起，她听到第一个吹错的音符时，埃尔兹别塔就意识到了。这是给她的信号——给她的，埃尔兹别塔·克鲁兹！约瑟夫一定遇上某种特殊的、不同寻常的危险了！他指望着她能想起那个他在玩笑间说出的小秘密，他指望她了解到他的处境。这是为什么？或许他被人扣住，身不由己——埃尔兹别塔的直觉已经接近事情的真相——或许有人正监视着他，让他无法敲响警钟。

对！约瑟夫这号声就是吹给她听的。

她必须行动，必须得帮助约瑟夫，马上，立刻！只是，怎样才是最明智的做法呢？她不能吵醒安德鲁太太，那她该不该去叫她叔叔？他还和约翰·特林在阁楼里——阁楼还亮着灯，也没听到特林下来的声音。她知道他们只会笑话她瞎担心，然后送她上床休息。于是，她静静地离开沙发，穿过房间，走到门口，拉开门闩，打开了房门。她跨过门口，关上门后回自己的屋子拿上院门的钥匙，披了件斗篷。不一会儿，她就到了街上。

凌晨这个时间走在街上，对于没有武器的男人来说都很危险，更不要说是手无寸铁的女孩了。因为这正是赌徒、酒鬼、窃贼出没的时候，城里最为肮脏污秽的东西正潜伏在角落里，等待时机从背后袭击路过的人，抢夺钱财。城里也有巡夜卫兵，在大批出动打击那些成群结伙的窃贼和杀人犯的时候，他们倒是有些作用，可法律仅仅能够对那些落入法网的人施展威严，大部分违法者还是逍遥法外。所以，在深夜的城市街道上，尤其是这样晚的时候，人们最好的朋友就是一把利剑或一根棒子。

出了院墙，埃尔兹别塔就开始向她的守护神——圣女伊丽莎白祷告。在明亮的月光下，她看到此时的鸽子街空荡荡的，她背靠着墙根，在墙的阴影下缓缓地走向左手边的十字街，打算从那里直奔一个街区之外的圣安街。她刚从扶壁的保护下走出来，正站在街角，这时从她身后的鸽子街传来了男人的声音。她不敢回头看，径直绕过街角冲进了十字街，顺着粗糙鹅卵石铺就的地面奔跑起来。

不过，还是有人看见了她。她听到一个声音喊道：“谁在那里？”接着，就是一阵追她的脚步声。

“一个女的，我敢打赌。”她向前冲的时候听到后面人这么说。月亮仿佛就挂在十字街的正上方，照得房屋连影子也没有。追她的人已经从鸽子街转了过来，大步流星地在后面追赶。

这时候，她的脑海里想到了鞑靼人和纽扣脸彼得，不过跟着她的人并不是这种暴徒，这几个人只不过是帮穿着破衣烂衫的乞丐、小贼或者混混，目的只是向路人要些小钱买酒喝，或是能找个舒服的地方睡一觉。埃尔兹别塔这样年纪的女孩正是他们寻找的对象，因为抢劫她不用担心受伤，而且她的衣服或者包袱也许还能给他们换点钱花花。

“停下！停下！我们是朋友，”紧跟在她后面的人喊道，“我们不会在这时候伤害女人的！听着，你到哪里，我们就跟你到哪里。”但这人说话的声调，只令埃尔兹别塔跑得更快。

终于她右转跑到了圣安街，后面的男人还紧追不舍。她现在唯一的希望就是扬·康迪能赶快开门，如果她不能马上躲进屋里，后面的人就追上来了。

好在寻求扬·康迪帮助的人从来不用等太久。他一晚上都在忙着写作，如果没有在帮助遇到生活困难的灵魂，他就笔耕不辍——后来证明，他的这些作品在他死后对克拉科夫大学和整个文化界都具有不可估量的影响。因此，门铃声响起后，他停下写作，几步就到了门口。他刚打开门，女孩就从他身边冲了进去。

“是我，埃尔兹别塔·克鲁兹，”她说，“神父，我来这里，是因为有件事需要立刻行动，就是现在！不过你得先关上门，有人在追我。”

扬·康迪关上了门，即便因为看到女孩大半夜飞奔几条街来找自己而感到惊讶，他也没有表现出来，说实话，他已经习惯了各种突如其来的怪事。甚至在那些可怜的乞丐追到他家门口，好奇他们所追逐的人怎么就不见了的时候，他也有心出去和他们谈谈，再给他们些钱，因为他知道，这些人做出这种极端的事情，无非是因为贫穷和饥饿。不过，他意识到女孩的困境需要他立刻伸出援手，就关上了房门，把她带到书房。

“发生什么了，孩子？是不是又有强盗闯进你家了？难道是你叔叔遇到困难了？我觉得是这样的事情。”

女孩尽自己最大努力，把故事讲了出来，因为她一路奔跑，心里又担心约瑟夫，说起话来气喘吁吁的。但愿神父不会笑话她！不要认为她在胡思乱想。不过，令人尊敬的神父没有半点嘲笑的意思。

“你说得对，”她刚说完，扬·康迪就精神振奋地说道，“时间不等人。约瑟夫一定是遇到大危险了，希望上帝能帮他渡过难关。孩子，你待在这里，这里很安全。我马上派大学的仆役去喊卫兵，然后亲自和他们去塔楼看看。恐怕是出事了。”

几分钟之后，三十个全副武装的卫兵就朝着教堂的方向进军了。他们首先发现了被死死绑在墓地的教堂守门人，解救他之后，他们通过没有上锁的楼门，小心谨慎地登上了塔楼。

与此同时，塔楼上的哥萨克团伙已经开始对这次猎奇产生厌倦。起初，这个攻击空中教堂塔楼的主意激起了他们的好奇心和冒险欲，因为他们从来没有进行过这种进攻。所以，晚上早些时候，彼得叫十个人自愿跟他进入教堂的时候，没有人不争先恐后的。

然而，没想到这个任务竟然如此简单，对于这些嗜血狂徒来说毫无吸引力。事实上，彼得的计划是如此周密，这高耸的根据地是如此安全，但等待老大回来的过程是如此无聊，以至于在这凌晨时分，他们一个个都昏昏欲睡，除了一个人站在那里看守安德鲁，其他人都懒洋洋地瘫在地上，有的已经开始打盹。

所以，当一队卫兵悄无声息地爬到塔顶时，这些暴徒都大吃一惊。他们还没来得及反抗，甚至没有意识到发生了什么，就成了俘虏。而那个看守安德鲁的人根本没有时间执行老大布置的命令——他刚刚准备了结安德鲁的时候，就沦为了阶下囚。

当卫兵正在捆绑最后一名罪犯的胳膊时，约瑟夫跑了上来，他跳上台阶，一头扎进了他父亲的怀里。

“父亲！父亲！”他激动地喊着，“是埃尔兹别塔救了我们！”一想到这里，他的双眼就闪闪发亮，“埃尔兹别塔——埃尔兹别塔，”他重复着，“她听出来我今天吹号的方式和以前不一样，因为今天晚上我没有在中止音的地方停止吹奏《海那圣歌》，而是多吹了几个音符。她大晚上一个人跑去找扬·康迪神父，神父又叫来了卫兵。我刚才在楼梯下面见到了神父，是他告诉了我整个经过。”

“愿神保佑那个孩子，”安德鲁说着眼角泛起了泪花，“你呢，儿子，你是怎么逃脱的？我真担心——”

“那个坏蛋在拖着我回家的路上听到卫兵在街上行走，当他意识到卫兵是向着教堂方向来的时候，就像闪电一样消失在黑暗中，不管我了。不过，埃尔兹别塔还在学校大楼学者的住处等着呢。我必须赶快去找她，把一切告诉她，然后好好谢谢她。”

卫兵把囚徒一个个带走的时候，安德鲁先生正沉浸在自己的思考中。

塔尔诺夫大水晶球！塔尔诺夫大水晶球！那个鞑靼人说他是为塔尔诺夫大水晶球而来的！他说的可能是真的吗？他夜闯教堂塔楼还有其他的原因吗？他急匆匆地逼着约瑟夫带路，还有给手下下那样的命令，都是为什么呢？如果他只是为了报仇，那他们父子俩早就没命了。如果那天晚上攻击他们住处的时候，他没有抢走水晶球，那么那天晚上到底发生了什么？水晶球到底在哪里呢？





第十三章　塔尔诺夫大水晶球


这是四月的一天傍晚，彼得攻击教堂失败已经是几个星期之前的事情了。炼金术士克鲁兹和约翰·特林正在克鲁兹住所楼上的阁楼里，两人坐在简陋的木凳上，热烈地争论着两人之间出现的一些问题。虽然还是早春时节，但天气已经有些闷热，夕阳给远处的山丘披上了霞衣，将克拉库斯高地照得一片火红，还染红了河那边通往维耶里奇卡盐矿的公路。

从特林坐的位置可以透过小窗看到外面的阳光，而克鲁兹则坐在一片黑暗之中。在他们头顶上方的倾斜墙面上，炼金术士实验用的各种玻璃试管和药水瓶像宝石般闪闪发亮。炭火盆里的东西时不时地发出嘶嘶声、喷出小火苗或者冒出一股烟雾，就像是一条盘绕在寂静草地上的蟒蛇突然伸出了纤细的头。

“我跟你说过，我受够了。”炼金术士回答着特林的话，“我已经下决心放弃这个我们冒险操作的科学实验了，然后去做我之前的研究，我这种敬畏上帝的人更适合做那种研究。”

特林笑了，声音低沉，但充满恶意。“你就这点胆量？”他反问道，“你口口声声说要探索未知世界的奇妙，原来你就这点勇气。来，”过了一会儿，他好像改变了策略，毕竟炼金术士已经完全在他的掌控之中，至少他是这么想的。他补充道：“来，你把事情往好的方面想，我们已经走过了最艰难的阶段。我们已经花了那么多时间，如果找到了那个问题的答案，那一定是基于我们已经做出的牺牲。是不是催眠让你疲乏了，你承受不了？”

炼金术士用双手捂着脑袋，只是不断地重复着，“我累了——我累了。”

特林厌恶地看着他，但还是抑制住了愤怒，用轻柔的语气说道：“那么，如果出了问题，责任都在你身上，克鲁兹先生。我真是不理解，你这样伟大的人竟然会因为我操作的这种简单的实验而感到筋疲力尽。我给很多人都做过类似的催眠，甚至时间更长，完全没有害处，他们也没有因此感到过身体疲劳。”

“唉，”炼金术士呻吟着，好像是在做辩解，“除了你的催眠之外，我还受到了其他的催眠，而且几乎从不间断。”

“什么？”特林惊讶地从凳子上跳了起来，“你说什么？你还被其他人催眠了？那么，其他人也知道了我们之间的秘密？谁还掌握了这种罕见的技艺？我以为在这座城里除了我之外，没有人会这种催眠术了。”他气愤地瞪着克鲁兹，手指不由移到了腰带间挂着的短刀的手柄处。虽说特林还只是个年轻人，但他非常看重自己的神秘力量。同时，他的情绪中还带有一丝恐惧——对于那些因为从事黑魔法或者歪门邪道而被带到法官面前的人，那时候的当权者往往会严加处置，重则判处死刑，轻则处以刺面、鞭刑、杖刑或者流放等。

不过，特林的魔法那时候看似神秘，如今看来却并不难解释。那种所谓某些人让他人进入恍惚状态，就是我们今天所说的催眠。在那个几乎人人迷信的年代，催眠被看作是恶毒的魔鬼对人所做的最邪恶的事情。从某种意义上说，特林就拥有这种能力，能够对愿意的人进行催眠，而炼金术士克鲁兹就受到特林的引诱，为了寻找炼金术的秘密而主动接受他的催眠。

在大多数的催眠情况下，催眠者都能逐渐控制他的催眠对象，所以几个月以来，炼金术士已经完全沦为了特林的工具，对于他的能力和学术成就，特林了如指掌，所以他毫不犹豫地利用他来达到自己的目的。不过，他也格外小心，他一直要求炼金术士对他们的事情绝对保密，因为如果他们正在使用这种魔法的事情被人知道了，他们俩谁也逃不出法律的惩罚。

“不是人，”炼金术士满脸痛苦地回答道，“催眠我的不是人，可能是——魔鬼！”

“魔鬼？”特林被这话吓了一跳，一动不动地站在那里。炼金术士是不是疯了？

“是的，就是魔鬼。我实在是受不了了。”炼金术士从凳子上站起来，面对着特林，“你，你拥有超出常人的法力，而且知道我脑子中的大多数想法，包括我做的各种科学实验背后的秘密。但是，我心里还有一个秘密没告诉你，它让我因为小心谨慎而背负着巨大压力，让我的心因为罪孽而变得麻木不仁。来，我给你看样东西，它拥有你想象不到的魔力。看——”他的语气变得有些失控，声音也开始颤抖。他在阁楼里来回地走动着，就像是在为实验做准备。他在屋子的正中间架起一个三脚架，然后用链条把架子的顶端连接起来，好像要在上面放一口小锅，接着，他打开放在屋檐下角落里的大箱子，从里面拿出一个黑布包裹，然后把它放在了三脚架顶上。

“我们现在点上灯。”他说。

他在炭火盆里撒了一些粉末，里面突然升起一股火苗。整个房间都被照亮了，屋里最为显眼的就是支撑着那个神秘东西的三脚架。炼金术士一把扯下那块遮布，仿佛是揭开了一颗精美的水钻，三脚架的铜顶上立刻呈现出一片流光溢彩的奇妙景象。那物体有人的脑袋那么大，精致的表面没有任何人工雕琢的痕迹，它孕育于天然的地下洞穴深处，一滴滴水珠经历了上万年的累积才逐渐造就了它。它的外层像山泉水一般清澈，当你透过这一层，看得越来越深，还能发现一丝蓝光，其中心隐隐约约地泛着玫瑰色，简直美得举世无双，向它的内部望上一眼，感觉就像是在凝视无垠的海洋。

“天啊！”特林尖声喊道，“这是什么？”

炼金术士的声音低沉，就如同人们在教堂中说话的声音一般，“塔尔诺夫大水晶球。”

“塔尔诺夫大水晶球！”特林重复着，“塔尔诺夫大水晶球！怎么会？难道这就是炼金术士和魔法师几百年来一直在寻找的那块石头？天啊，塔尔诺夫大水晶球！”他高度兴奋，几乎喊了出来。“天啊，伙计，我们这是有了古往今来最珍贵的宝贝。”他的脑海中想象着这个宝贝的作用，激动地跳来跳去。“现在我明白了，”他继续说道，“如果你一直注视着它，就好像受到了魔鬼的控制。你知道吗？这块石头可以让人进入催眠状态，从而找出世间所有的秘密。你知道吗，我们一直探索的那个谜团，无疑可以因此而解开！”他靠近水晶球，像是口渴难耐的人看到了一口水井一般，贪婪地注视着水晶球。

塔尔诺夫大水晶球还拥有一个神奇之处，也许世界上所有的水晶球都是如此，就是每次注视着它的时候，它都会呈现出不同的景象。这其中有许多原因，比如水晶球周围的光线永远都不一样，也可能是因为水晶球具有一种奇特的属性，即反映出注视者埋藏在大脑深处的想法。人们最开始被塔尔诺夫大水晶球所吸引是因为它的美丽、它的颜色、它发出的光芒，它所呈现出的千变万化的景象，此外，就是所有这种水晶石都拥有的无以名状的魅力。当然，钻石也拥有这种迷人的特质，无数人为之着迷，但钻石的体积通常都太小，人的双眼无法长时间在上面聚焦，而水晶球由于体积较大，而且外形精美，所以才拥有这种属性。

塔尔诺夫水晶球是中世纪的魔法师所知道的最精美的水晶球。尽管学者、天文学家和炼金术士对魔法嗤之以鼻，但科学和魔法之间并没有明显的分界，事实上很多科学家在进行科学研究的时候发现自己陷入了魔法实验。克鲁兹也是这样，他平常并不使用魔法和任何形式的黑魔法，可如今他却完全被那个学生特林所控制，受到对方狂热的牵引。

“我说了，我受够了！”炼金术士又一次重复着，“为了得到这个水晶球，我已经出卖了自己的灵魂，我要把它还给它真正的主人。这个水晶球沾满了邪恶和鲜血，它拥有一段不幸而悲惨的历史，而且古老得就如同这个世界本身一样。”

“还回去！”特林喊着，“还回去！为什么要这么做，听我说，克鲁兹先生。我不知道你是怎么得到这东西的，我现在也不会问你，但是如果你不用它来达到我们的目的，那你真是太可悲了。我们可以在找到炼金的方法之后再把它还回去，就当它真是被偷走了，如果你的良心能够忍受，把它留下来，或许我可以……”

“不，不，约翰·特林，”炼金术士坚定地说道，“一定得把它还给它真正的主人。我一直隐藏着这个秘密，因为我担心你知道的话，肯定会受到诱惑——其实，要不是因为这个秘密让我饱受折磨，你也不会知道。”

“都听你的，”特林嘴上有所让步，顺着克鲁兹，但心里却在打着别的算盘，“不过，咱们还是赶快看看能不能从里面得到点石成金的方法。我相信我们肯定可以成功，然后就能摆脱统治着大学的那些傻家伙了。”

“那么，实验不能太长，”炼金术士说道，“我盯着这个发光的东西时间已经太长了。”

“你之前就应该告诉我的。”特林说话的口吻像个友善的建议者。

“但是，实际上，”炼金术士继续说道，“我怀疑我们能不能从水晶球里获得炼金的秘密。我有种感觉，也不知道对不对，就是这个水晶球只是把我们自己的想法反映给我们。我们可能不能像召唤友好的神灵一样，召唤它来告诉我们一些未知的秘密——我们可能无法对着它许愿，让梦想成真。我开始怀疑这一切了。”说完，他就站起身来，开始大步踱来踱去。“它已经对我造成了不良的影响。我再也不能像以前那样直接看别人了。每当我看着水晶球的时候，我的想法就会被扭曲地返还给我。虽然我在这样的凝视中获得了很多乐趣，但我发现沉迷于这个水晶球的深处是致命的。如我之前所说，我从中找到了很多乐趣，要是我在世间无牵无挂，我甚至会竭尽人类的才智来进行这些研究。但有时，我感觉我的灵魂正迷失在它的光芒之中。”

“冒昧问一下，”特林再也抑制不住好奇心，问道，“你是怎么得到水晶球的？”

“事情是这样的，”炼金术士一直独自保守着这个秘密，非常愿意释放出心中的压力，“不久之前的一天晚上，来了一帮盗贼，我就用火药和硝石逗了逗他们。”

“然后呢？”

“好像那时候这个水晶球就在我们楼下那家人的手里。”

“什么！那个姓科沃斯基的吹号手和那个男孩？”

“对，不过那并不是他们的真名。他们真正的姓氏是恰尔涅茨基，原来住在乌克兰。”

“哦——那么那些盗贼呢？他们是鞑靼人？哥萨克人？一直跟踪那家人？是不是从第聂伯河流域来的？”

“是的，事实上，在我用炸药吓唬他们的时候，水晶球正在领头的那个人手里。我的攻击让他吃了一惊，他痛得把水晶球也掉到了地上——因为炸药粉溅到他的脸上，烧着了他的头发——水晶球滚到地上，我就扑上去把它拿了起来。”

“那么，恰尔涅茨基一家又是怎么拿到水晶球的呢？”特林急切地问道。

“是这样的。十三世纪的时候，鞑靼人摧毁了一个波兰村庄，就是现在的塔尔诺夫，当时恰尔涅茨基家族就住在那里，当然，是和其他人家一起。他们家族中一个叫安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基的人在抗击鞑靼人守卫城市的过程中表现英勇，所以人们就推举他保管大水晶球，也就是眼前的这颗塔尔诺夫大水晶球。这可是那个老镇的荣耀，连国王都要去那里一睹它的真容。因为它除了具有罕见的价值和美丽外，还具有那些你所提到的特点：从水晶球里能够看到过去和未来的秘密，能够从中看到别人的想法，能够学到征服万物的方法，像鸟一样翱翔天空，隐身遁形，点石成金。那时候，谁都不能盯着它超过三分钟，因为即使是短短的三分钟也会让人意乱神迷，大脑中出现奇怪的想法。”

“那恰尔涅茨基家族是怎么在鞑靼人那里拯救出水晶球的呢？”

“他们带着水晶球逃到了喀尔巴阡山，在那里一直待到鞑靼人巴图被打回金帐汗国的领土。之后，这个水晶球就代代相传，到了现在这位安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基的祖先手里。他们一直定居在乌克兰，那时候乌克兰刚刚并入波兰版图，受瓦迪斯瓦夫·亚盖洛统治。不过，安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基这个名字在波兰很常见，所以当这一家人搬到楼下那个寒酸的屋子时，我并没有想到他们来自那个拥有塔尔诺夫水晶球的恰尔涅茨基家族”

“是那个安德鲁和你讲的这些故事吗？”

“是的，水晶球消失的第二天，他把我当成了心腹好友，毕竟我知道他的真实身份，而且也听过一些他的故事。”

“那你之前听说过水晶球吗？”

“有哪个炼金术士没听过啊？”他回答道，“据说很早以前，它被从东方某国带到了埃及，之后的几百年它一直在埃及的寺庙里。罗马人征服埃及的时候，水晶球被带到了罗马。当罗马人征战在黑海附近的时候，一个罗马军官爱上了一个特兰西瓦尼亚女子，被女子要求带领一个军团，去罗马的一个寺庙里偷出了水晶球。当他的罪行被发现后，皇帝派出一队士兵去抓捕他，但他逃到了现在的哈利兹，那时候被罗马人叫作盖利兹。他和他的妻子隐姓埋名，住在那里的一个偏远村庄，就是后来的塔尔诺夫。这个水晶球就一直留在那里，直到后来传到了恰尔涅茨基家族手里。那里聚集起大批的魔法师、黑魔法师、占星术士和炼金术士——有些人虔诚正直，还有一些只不过就是江湖骗子罢了。”

“既然如此，肯定有很多人想从恰尔涅茨基家里偷走这个水晶球吧？”

“只有一次。有一段时间人们没有大水晶球的线索，甚至连炼金术士和占星术士都毫无头绪。后来，安德鲁·恰尔涅茨基家里出了一个逃奴，在东方散布消息说水晶球就在这家人手里，之后才有人尝试寻找水晶球。后来的事情你就知道了，因为那次抢掠，安德鲁先生在乌克兰的房屋和财产被烧毁，我不知道是谁在背后指使，但我相信那个强盗头领肯定被某个位高权重的人收买了。”

“那些被抓住的抢匪没说什么吗？”

“没有，我相信他们知道的也不多，而且大多数鞑靼人都守口如瓶，宁死不屈，即使动用极刑，他们也不会说。”

“那安德鲁先生怀疑你拿了水晶球吗？”

“安德鲁先生把我当朋友。所以，我只要多拿这个水晶球一天，就多内疚、难受一天。”

“你想想啊，要不是你，说不定哥萨克人早就带着水晶球逃之夭夭了，那它可就永远地消失了。”

“我知道，可这也不是个正当理由啊。我偷偷拿走了水晶球，这和小偷的做法并没有什么区别。那天晚上，我在安德鲁先生家的地板上第一次看到这个宝贝，为了得到它，我宁愿放弃上天堂的机会。我拿到它的时候，下面院子里的人们都在关注那些强盗和从屋顶逃跑的那个家伙。我把它藏在衣服下面，带回了阁楼。”

“你做得很好，”特林的心头涌动着狂野的激动之情，“看！快看水晶球！它就像是一个有生命的东西一样在那里闪烁舞动，准备说出它的秘密。快！把椅子拉近点，就像我平时给你做催眠时坐得那么近。现在好好地盯着它，”他虎视眈眈地看着犹豫不决的炼金术士，像是一条蟒蛇紧盯着无助的小鸟——“来，咱们开始那个最伟大的实验吧。”

炼金术士按照吩咐把椅子拉到了水晶球的前面，开始注视着水晶球。特林站在不远处，紧紧地看着他。一分钟——两分钟——三分钟——炼金术士仍然在盯着水晶球，在特林眼里，他就像是一只被猫玩弄的老鼠。四分钟——五分钟。炼金术士一动不动地坐着，只是坐姿微微变化，突然，他的手臂和脖子好像僵硬了，脸上的表情好像完全变了一个人，他的呼吸变得均匀，但每次呼吸都比平时更深，间隔都比平时更长。他双眼圆睁，凝视着。

“听着！”特林厉声命令道。

“我听着呢。”炼金术士马上回答说。

特林激动地颤抖着，他没想到炼金术士不仅比以前更快地进入了催眠状态，而且依然能给他答复，他原本还担心水晶球的吸引会让炼金术士不理他呢。不过，毕竟特林已经给他催眠了这么多次，他的大脑似乎是在自动地回复特林的命令。

“告诉我你看到了什么。”

“我看见一个大厅，很像一个炼金术士的房间，里面摆满了炭火盆和玻璃容器，这些容器里面火红的液体正沸腾着，容器旁边还放着大铜壶，里面冒出腾腾的热气。”

“你这是来到了魔鬼的实验室，”特林急切地说道，“有人在工作吗？”

接着是一阵沉默，炼金术士的意识正在巨大的房间里漫游。

“没人。”他终于说道。

“那里有没有什么手稿？”特林催促着。

又是一阵沉默。接着——“有，墙上挂着一个羊皮卷。”

“拿下来。”

“它很烫手。”

“别怕，你的收获将远远大于你的痛苦。”

“我拿到了。”

特林下意识地向炼金术士的手看去。奇怪的是，它们竟然发红了，好像是被烫了一样。“羊皮纸上面说什么，念出来。”

炼金术士慢慢地回答着，好像正在阅读，然后他用拉丁语说着：“这里记载的东西无所谓好坏，但人人祈望得到。”

“好！现在打开羊皮卷。”

又是一阵沉默。最终炼金术士说道：“我找到了一些东西。”

“念！”

“不，我念不了，都是些符号。”

“那就写下来。”特林敏捷地把一块板子滑到炼金术士的膝盖上，然后把一根用木头和羽毛做成的笔放到他的指尖。他已经给上面蘸上了浓浓的墨水，然后他引导着炼金术士手中的笔，直到笔落在一张他之前放在板子上的全新的洁白羊皮纸上面。

炼金术士写出了下面的内容：

"Per Fit Lapis Philosophorum."[1]

“还有吗？”

炼金术士继续写道：

"Quod primum incredibile, non continuo falsum est; crebo siquidemfaciem mendacii veritas retinet."[2]

“不是，这什么也不是，你发现其他的配方了吗？”

炼金术士仔细地看着，大声读着：

“根据底比斯人奥林匹杜拉斯、埃及人奥赛恩斯、拜占庭人塞洛斯、阿拉伯人吉亚布的说法：加热铜盆，倒入满满一管硫黄，硫黄融化后释放出一股灵气，灵气散尽后，缓缓倒入诞生于水星的水银。眨眼之间，这种溶液将会从原本自然的状态变成土的状态，变成一种黑色的、没有生命的死物质。然后将这种没有生命的物质放进密封的试管并加热，它将突然再次获得生气，变为明亮的红色物质。”

“写下来，写下来！”特林激动地喊道。炼金术士写完后，他又迫不及待地问道：“还有吗？”

“很多。这里还记录了七金章、翡翠石碑和精神法典的秘密。

Natura Naturam superat; deinde vero natura naturae congaudet; tandemnatura naturam continet.”[3]

“别念了，那都是没用的理论，”特林喊道，“找一找，把制作炼金石的方法写下来，那样我们才能把铜炼成金子。”

炼金术士继续念道：

“底比斯人左西姆斯说过，真正点石成金的方法是：在加热过的硫黄和水银溶液中，加入从印度腹地找到的硝石。然后，在里面加入铜块，它就能立刻变成金子。”

“快，工作！烧起火盆，拿出硫黄、水银，还有铜块，”特林命令道，“你有没有印度的硝石？”

“有，柜子第三层的架子上有一小包。”炼金术士回答道。特林激动地冲过去拿上硝石，准备好实验需要的所有材料。他相信炼金术士找到了他心心念念的点石成金的方法，其实，他对炼金 术背后的科学知识知之甚少，由于他的无知，他命令炼金术士合成了一种极为危险的化学物质。而炼金术士，完全是在特林的催眠状态下工作，根本没有机会在特林的意图和自己的机械行动之间调用自己的正常意识。而且，他在被催眠状态下获得的这些信息都是他曾经在书上看过的，那个在热溶液中加入硝石的做法，只不过是由于他的身体过于劳累和虚弱而形成的幻想罢了。

特林急匆匆地安排着做实验用的东西，与此同时，克鲁兹用拉丁语哼哼着一首赞美炼金术和炼金术士的歌曲：

Inexhaustum fert thesaurum

Qui de virgis fecit aurum

Gemmas de lapidibus.[4]

“快点合成点金石！”特林命令着。

炼金术士还在催眠状态中，他站起来，在炭火盆前倾着身子，他把一些片状的易燃物放到炭火盆的下面，用来生火，然后又从远处的火盆里拿出一块木炭，添到里面。不一会儿这块炭就全黑了，嘶嘶地生出剧烈的热量，引燃了火盆里的东西。起初，火盆里燃起一团黄色的火苗，缓缓地舞动着，后来，就变成了跳跃的蓝色火苗。克鲁兹将满满一容器硫黄放在火苗上面，很快硫黄就冒出一股浓烟，弥漫了整个房间。

两人迫不及待地把脑袋探到火盆的上面，生怕错过了什么。炼金术士晃动着手腕，将水银浇在融化的硫黄上面。接下来的反应和羊皮卷上写的一样。很快亮闪闪的水银就和融化的硫黄混合在一起，形成了一种黑不溜秋的物质。特林又递给克鲁兹一个密封容器，克鲁兹晃动着第一个容器里烧热的物质，将其倒进密封的容器，然后又把密封容器放在盆里加热。克鲁兹机械地完成了这一系列动作，好像一直被人操纵着。几秒之后，他打开了密闭的容器，那黑色的物质变成了流动的红色物质。

“硝石！硝石！”特林在他身边激动地叫着。

炼金术士接过特林手里的小包，一下扔到了眼前热滚滚的物质里。他刚把小包扔进去，就拉着特林向后一跳，好像是出于自我保护的潜意识，退到了屋子中间。特林生气地破口大骂，但他刚骂了一半，阁楼瞬间在可怕的爆炸声中开始晃动。

“快点！拿起水晶球，下楼！”特林尖叫着，已经跑出了门，边跑边疯狂地拍打衣服上的火星。

爆炸物溅起的火苗飞到了干燥的屋顶和墙上，火势很快蔓延开来。房间里所有的东西都开始燃烧，再晚一会儿，就逃不出去了。炼金术士依然在恍惚之中，他按照特林的命令拿起了水晶球，跑向楼梯。火苗落在他手里的水晶球上，让它像上百万颗钻石、红宝石和翡翠一般闪烁。他冒着大火，右手用尽全力紧抱着这个水晶球，左手抓着楼梯的栏杆，像个醉汉一样摇摇晃晃地出来，刚刚站稳，就得继续下楼。特林的动作就敏捷得多，克鲁兹刚下到三楼，他已经跑下楼梯，冲出了大门口，全力呼喊着卫兵，让他们通知消防队他身后的房屋起火了。但是街上看不到卫兵，他只能跑着去找。在他搜寻卫兵的时候，克鲁兹先生已经跑出了院门，消失在黑暗中。塔尔诺夫大水晶球就藏在他黑袍的褶皱下面。

他身后的大火已经吞噬了阁楼的屋顶，蔓延到邻近的房屋。短短几分钟，大火已经穿过附近空旷的庭院，烧到了克拉科夫大学的一栋宿舍。此时，风向突然转变，席卷着滚滚火焰朝着市场的方向前进，两个人刚刚从阁楼里逃出不到一刻钟，克拉科夫的大学区就陷入了可怕的火灾之中，整个克拉科夫城也危在旦夕。

第十四章　大火烧城


从很早的时期开始，克拉科夫就被分为四个区域——城堡区、陶工区、屠户区以及斯拉夫科夫区。每个区都有一位区长，负责各自区域内的各种事宜，灭火就是其主要职责之一。所以，当巡夜卫兵发现该区的街道受到了大火威胁时，就立刻跑到区长的住处，猛敲大门，用尽全力呼喊着“着火啦”，好让家仆飞快地去叫区长。不一会儿，区长就起来穿上了衣服，派人传唤管理城市水库和渡槽的水利官。

同时，圣玛利亚教堂塔楼上的守夜人也看到了火苗，拉响了警钟。城市的各个角落都回响着呼喊“着火了”的声音，庄严的哥特式建筑和教堂被火焰照得通红明亮，四周一片混乱。水利官已经启动了消防机制，鼓手们沿街串巷地敲打着，目的是叫醒那些肩负着灭火重任的商人和学徒。城里的商会都集合了起来，宫殿的仆人成群结队地给水桶灌满水，站到房顶上，城里的市民都急忙从墙上取下钩子、斧头和水桶准备灭火。法律规定家家必备这些工具，以备不时之需。

不过，不论火势是大是小，这对于那时的克拉科夫城来说，都是一件严肃的事情，因为城里成千上万的房屋都是木制的，它们相互簇拥，挤在人口稠密的街区。老大学周围的大部分住房都非常古老、干燥，而且到处布满了蜘蛛网，哪怕房顶上的一丝火星就足够迅速蔓延，引发熊熊大火和滚滚浓烟。随着火势蔓延，人们都惊慌地涌到了街上，每座建筑中都到处是人。俯视这一场景，简直就像是一个巨大的蚂蚁窝突然被细心的园丁毁坏或是焚烧了一般。

女人和小孩呼喊着从屋里跑出来。穿黑袍的学生手里拿着手稿和羊皮卷，冲到街上，还有人拿着玻璃管、星象盘或者金属隔板。屋里的人找不到藏身之处，手忙脚乱地跑来跑去，尽量躲避蔓延的大火所带来的热气和恐惧。绝望的人们把各种各样的东西从窗户扔出来，街上很快就布满了家具、衣服、床，还有各种各样的私人物品。火苗像春天雷雨天气时的雨点一样落下来，有的物品已经沾上火星，开始燃烧，这让大街上的人们更加无处可逃。有的人家还保持着理智，开始勇敢地灭火，水盆和木桶也被利用起来了，烧着的墙壁也已经开始被拆除。

水利官已经调集了一大队水车，它们从着火的建筑物一直排到渡槽，平时这些水车都是马拉的，这天晚上也有一些是马拉的，但这时候很难调集足够的马匹，男人甚至男孩都套上了轴杆，拉起了水车。守在渡槽的人们正忙着给水车加水，水车装满后就驶向不远处的火场，扑完火之后就转向进入另外一条街回到渡槽继续装水。最近的渡槽离起火点大约不到一英里。

水利官同时派出了一队带着钩子和斧头的队伍围住火势即将到达的区域，因为从大火蔓延的速度来看，克拉科夫大学区应该是保不住了。这些人受命拆除任何有可能加剧火势的建筑，不论大火是否已经波及那里。一队人在圣方济各教堂前面排成一排，另一队被安排到了圣安街，还有一队在布拉卡街。然而，大火已经开始吞噬原本的包围圈，灭火的队伍不得不向后撤退。市场上人声鼎沸，乱作一团，人们拼命从鸽子街着火的地方逃到了这里，空地上很快就堆满了从火场里救出的各种财物。有两户人家甚至占据了示众台，母亲在那里安顿孩子睡觉，心里感激着终于找到一块休息的地方。

在这喧嚣之中，一个中年女人、一个男孩、一个女孩，还有一只狗，正穿过鸽子街，费力地走在家具碎片和从窗户扔出的私人物品中间。起火的时候，他们正在睡觉，直到被大火包围，他们才醒过来，所以除了他们自己和身上的衣服之外，根本来不及营救任何东西。这个男孩是约瑟夫，女孩是埃尔兹别塔，女人是安德鲁太太。“狼”的狗链已经被松开，但它受了惊吓，顺从地跟在他们后面，不知所措。

他们艰难地走在混乱之中，每个人都心事重重。约瑟夫心里一直思考着走出着火区的捷径，不过这可是个难题，因为这火势一直在耍花招。它并不是像一面火墙一样径直向前，而是转着圈地蔓延，四处跳跃，跳过这座房子，又蹦到另一座上面，前进、后退、侧移，速度惊人，火势猛烈。有时候，房顶会喷出一阵火焰，危险地从躲在房顶下的人们身边燃过，当他们发现火已经在身后落下，为落在身上的是微风而感到欢喜，可过一会儿，房顶又出其不意地喷出烟雾和火焰，好像有火魔在无形中操控着这一切，但这个新的危险一定会过去的。

他们来到鸽子街与一条十字小巷交叉的位置，就是现在的威斯尔那街，但这条巷子那时已经烟雾弥漫，遍地是倒塌的木梁。看来，从这条路逃脱是不可能了，现在只能硬着头皮从鸽子街向前走，从那里转弯就可以到达布拉卡街。

埃尔兹别塔心里最关心的就是她叔叔的安危，他们从着火的房子中逃出之前，使劲地呼喊着他的名字，但他却没有回应。阁楼已经被烧得一片火红，闪耀着猛烈的紫色火焰，人根本无法活着待在那里。安德鲁太太满脑子想的是她的丈夫，琢磨着他是不是从教堂出来救他们了，心里希望他们能够赶快到达教堂的塔楼和他会合，免得他太过担心他们。

鸽子街南端这一段的房屋稍微高一些，空气也要凉一些。虽然大火也肆虐到了这里，但火势并不像房屋低矮区域那么凶猛，这样一来，人们跑起来也就更快了。唯一的问题就是越来越多的人从三个方向一齐涌到街上，让他们三个人很难保持不被冲散。他们只能紧扣着手臂，奋力在人群中冲出一条路来。周围的情景很悲惨：只顾着逃命的人们，被迫离开唯一的家，根本顾不上拿东西；在拥挤中迷路的小孩尖声哭喊着，尽力在人群的推搡中站稳身体；涌动的人流中还有羸弱的病人，有的被家人扛在肩上，有的躺在简易搭起的担架上；有一个老人骑坐在一个年轻人的脖子上，就像特洛伊城被烧毁时，安喀塞斯由艾涅阿斯背着逃跑一样。

一家人终于来到了大火未能触及的安全地带，他们比那天晚上的许多人要幸运许多。虽然约瑟夫很想瘫到地上好好休息一番，但是刚一缓过气，他就督促大家继续出发，穿过布拉卡街，朝着市场的方向继续前进。约瑟夫心里盘算着，等到把他母亲和埃尔兹别塔安顿到他父亲值班的塔楼之后，他就出来帮忙灭火，他心中那股年轻人的英勇朝气召唤着他加入这场战斗。正当他们走在布拉卡街的时候，突然从瓦维尔山的方向传来一阵马蹄声。

“等一下，”约瑟夫一边说一边拉着母亲退到路边，“城堡派出士兵出来维持秩序了。”

他说得没错，因为他话音刚落，一队穿着锁甲，手拿长矛的骑兵就出现在布拉卡街。他们排成排，包围了被大火威胁的区域。不一会儿，步兵和工匠也来了，他们和卫兵一起，开始拆除大火边缘的建筑。战争中的攻城装置也被拉到了布拉卡街，在它的重击之下，大火周围的建筑逐渐倒塌。

这样就能防止火势蔓延了，约瑟夫心想。

他们继续朝着教堂走去，经过市场的时候，一队士兵正拖着一个从着火区抓到的犯人往前走。

“那是个小偷。”约瑟夫说。

“天啊，”安德鲁太太惊讶地喊道，“没想到竟然有人从受灾的可怜人那里偷东西，真是残忍。”

这队士兵走近的时候，火把的光照到了犯人的脸上，约瑟夫惊讶地叫了出来。

“母亲，快看啊，那是纽扣脸彼得！就是他带人袭击了我们家。我们来克拉科夫第一天碰到的那个坏人也是他！他还跑到教堂塔楼，把我和父亲抓了起来……你看他正在那里挣扎呢，不过他已经被紧紧抓住了。哎呀，母亲，抓他的不是城里的普通卫兵，而是国王的亲兵。你看他们的头盔上都有王冠的标志，他们的衣着也很华丽。你看到了吗？不知道纽扣脸彼得是怎么被抓住的。”

约瑟夫说对了。彼得终于落入了法网，是被国王的亲兵所抓。而且从他们押解他的方式来看，显然他们认为这是一个要犯。他们并没有在市政大楼处停留，违反市政法的人才会被押到那里，卫兵沿着城堡街，要直接把他押送到瓦维尔山上的皇家城堡。

他们来到教堂的时候，安德鲁先生已经急得满头大汗，生怕他们遭遇了不测。看到他们安然无恙，他挨个拥抱了他们，然后语重心长地对约瑟夫说道：“我希望你可以留在这里，负责在后半夜吹奏《海那圣歌》。着火的区域有许多工作要做，需要每个人出一份力……对了，克鲁兹先生没和你们一起。我想，他应该是留在那里和其他人一起救火了吧？”

“事实上，我也不清楚，父亲。我们喊了他很多次，但我们跑下楼的时候，他的阁楼已经烧得像火炉一样。”

“那我一定得出去找找他，我们之前一直承蒙他的照顾，他是我们的恩人，哪怕他真的出了什么事，我们也要在废墟中找到他。上帝保佑他还活着，那样的话，他可以暂时和我们住在这里，直到他找到住处。”

但当他听约瑟夫说彼得已经被抓之后，脸色突然严肃起来，他说如果彼得的那些人还在城里，他最好还是别离开自己的妻子和两个孩子。但他转念一想，还是觉得自己应该去帮忙救火，因为现在城里已经遍地火光，即使他们真的遇到危险，也不愁没人帮忙。

于是，安德鲁义无反顾地加入了成千上万名市民组成的灭火队伍，英勇地与人们一同对抗那晚肆虐克拉科夫城的大火。他们将大火围住，拆除了周围可能着火的建筑物。城墙边上的大学预科学校是最后一座失火的建筑，灭火大军之后又拆掉了老犹太城门附近的房屋，大火终于止步于此。但火势又沿着大学的其他建筑蔓延，烧毁了两栋大楼，才最终在圣安街北边的第二条街处停了下来。而其他方向，大火已经一路烧毁了圣方济各教堂修道院和附近的房屋，冲过城堡街，将那里的一排房屋夷为平地。

人们在火海的周围建起一条宽阔的防火带，商人们赶着水车，往返于渡槽和防火带，防火带已经积满了水，几乎形成了一道水墙。人们忙碌了七八个小时，终于抑制住了大火的势头。有的房屋和废墟在之后的几天里依然冒着烟，甚至还有火焰，不过当积满水的防火带建成的时候，大的危险便已经过去了。

第二天，当安德鲁先生在闪耀的晨光中回到塔楼的时候，克拉科夫城的三分之一已经成为废墟。幸运的是，毁掉的大多数都是从卡济米尔大帝即位之前就已经建起的木头棚屋，而不是城里繁华的区域。一百多年前，卡济米尔大帝下令将半个城市的木建筑改造为石头建筑，要不是这一命令，估计一四六二年的这场大火将摧毁整个克拉科夫城。

埃尔兹别塔和安德鲁太太挽着手臂，在吹号手的小床上睡着了。约瑟夫把沙漏放在面前的木梁上，守在外面，注视着大学附近冒着烟的废墟。

“城市安全了吗？”这是他问父亲的第一个问题。

“已经没有危险了，”安德鲁先生回答说，“不过，城里到处都是无家可归的人。”

“您看见炼金术士了吗？”

“没有，他好像和弥漫在整个城市的烟雾一样飘走了。”

“可怜的埃尔兹别塔。”约瑟夫感叹道。

屋中睡着的女孩此刻虽然处于深度睡眠之中，但在自己的名字被提及的时候，轻声地咕哝了一声。

“不知道他是不是被困在阁楼里了？”安德鲁一边思索，一边说道，“那里是火灾的正中心位置。”

还没等安德鲁想明白，这个问题的答案意外地出现了。楼梯上传来了一阵脚步声，扬·康迪出现在了楼梯上，他扶着另一个人的胳膊，从这个人被烧焦的衣服和黑乎乎的脸上可以看出，他是从大火中出来的，曾经的黑袍破烂不堪，绕过肩膀周围，一直垂到腰间。他把手藏在这件袍子下面。

“安德鲁先生，”扬·康迪轻声说道，“我在街上发现了——克鲁兹先生。”他看到安德鲁满脸惊讶就解释道，“他的神志不太正常，大脑受到了一些东西的影响。不过，他带来了一件我们感兴趣的东西。”

安德鲁先生转过身看着克鲁兹——要不是扬·康迪的解释，他无论如何也认不出这是谁。约瑟夫好奇地盯着眼前这个怪异焦黑的身影，还有他在袍子下面交叉起来的神秘双手。

“哈哈哈！”炼金术士突然大笑起来，“大火把一切都带上天啦！你最后也没找到金子！约翰·特林！”说完，他又焦虑地看了看周围，“约翰·特林呢？他不回答我。他消失在大火中了。硝石扔进炭火，火焰赤红，发紫！噢呵！约翰·特林！来呀，约翰·特林，看看这个长夜之后我给你带来了什么！”

他把黑袍甩向身后，举起了藏在下面的东西。正在此时，阳光穿过东边的小窗户照进屋里，洒在那个东西上面，突然它就像成千上万颗钻石一样在清晨新修的草地上闪烁，那光芒就像瓦维尔山上国王宫殿里的大吊灯一样光彩夺目，像是王后冠上的红宝石和祖母绿一样璀璨，这个在晨曦的红色光焰照耀之下闪烁的奇妙之物，便是塔尔诺夫大水晶球！

“这个东西哪来的？”安德鲁惊讶地大喊了出来，惊醒了隔壁的安德鲁太太和埃尔兹别塔，“天啊，你是在哪儿找到这个多年以来一直都在我们家的宝贝的？我和我的祖先发誓要永远守护它，除了波兰国王，不会将它交给任何人。它不是被偷走了吗？为此我伤心了好久。它怎么到了你的手里？是不是从那个被国王亲兵抓走的恶棍手里抢过来的？难道是从大火的废墟里找到的？是不是——”真相突然闪现在他的脑海中，他不再说话。

“这个东西被诅咒了！”炼金术士突然喊道，他靠在扬·康迪胳膊上，身子摇摇晃晃，好像要晕倒了似的。“这上面沾满了鲜血，还有火！它引诱王公贵族走向毁灭！它让人因为欲望而疯狂！它让好人偷盗，恶人杀戮！我不要它了！我不要了！”他整个人像疯了一样，但这阵疯狂背后又显露着理智和决心。“我再也不要它了，”他重复着，“再也不理约翰·特林了！”

说完，他就晕倒在地。

扬·康迪把他扶起来，而埃尔兹别塔已经从号手房间跑了出来，她冲到他身边，亲吻着、爱抚着她叔叔那双被大火熏黑的双手。

安德鲁拾起塔尔诺夫大水晶球，微笑着将它举起一臂之远。

“现在我们所有人都将安享和平，”他说，“我终于可以履行家族的誓言，将它献给国王了。如果大水晶球的藏身之处还无人知晓，我或许还能一直这样留着它，既然现在秘密已经泄露了，它唯一安全的地方就是国王的宫殿了。克鲁兹先生说的没错，它已经给世间带来了太多的灾害。”

“既然这样，你马上就可以摆脱它了。”扬·康迪说道，“国王两天前回到了克拉科夫，我们今天上午就可以去城堡了。”





第十五章　国王卡济米尔·亚盖洛


波兰这座都城所拥有的众多美景之中，让约瑟夫最为倾心的莫过于这座坐落于瓦维尔山上的皇家城堡了。在经历了多次攻击之后，这座城堡的基石依旧坚不可摧，这里的高塔和围墙都是由砖块和石头垒砌而成的。城堡的中心是一座样式奇怪的圆塔，它在宫殿的护翼下俯瞰着下面蜿蜒的维斯瓦河以及古老的克拉科夫城。这座圆塔是远古时期人们祭祀斯拉夫自然之神的地方，这是一个隐秘而神圣的场所，当然在一些特殊的日子，平民百姓也能到这里参观，约瑟夫也曾站在这里思考古时候的事情。

约瑟夫对克拉库斯的传奇故事非常熟悉，这位黑暗时代的英雄杀死了曾经居住在这里的恶龙。据说城堡的地下有一个隧道通到维斯瓦河，当城堡受到攻击的时候，它就可以作为秘密逃生的出口。这曾经就是那条龙的藏身之处，直到克拉库斯征服了恶龙之后，瓦维尔山才开始有人居住，才慢慢出现了高耸入云的尖塔和钟楼。不过这一切，约瑟夫都已经见过了，那庄重荒凉的石基上耸立的所有建筑都曾经激起过他无尽的想象。然而，还有一项荣耀他未曾见过。那荣耀便是波兰的国王。

所以，大火过后的这个早晨，当一行人离开圣玛利亚教堂向瓦维尔山走去的时候，约瑟夫的胸口就像小鹿乱撞，怦怦直跳。他想象着马上就要经历的冒险。去觐见国王，而且直接站在国王眼前——他只要想象一下，就会觉得耳朵里血流涌动，指尖发麻。

在扬·康迪的建议下，他们带上了炼金术士，虽然他的神志还不清醒。

“今天早上，我发现他的时候，他正在废墟中游荡，”扬·康迪说道，“他一整夜都在城里最危险的地方跑来跑去，也不知道他是怎么躲过那些落下的木头的……他肯定是有心事，有些事情让他极度困扰，所以才会像着了魔一样。”

“那您认为带上他合适吗？”安德鲁先生问道，他从一开始就犹豫是否带上克鲁兹。

“也许吧，我有种奇怪的感觉，”神父回答道，“我觉得他能帮助我们。我们有很多事情需要向国王解释，克鲁兹在场的话，可以让我们的话更加可信。说不定，克鲁兹也能从中受益呢——他的大脑也需要一些启发，再说，他对我们又没有害处，带上他也无妨。”

克鲁兹的脸和双手已经洗干净了，大火在他身上留下的污垢也已经不见了，不过他的长袍已经不能穿了，安德鲁先生给他披上了一件长衫。

约瑟夫和这三个人一路同行。“狼”被留在了塔楼，在号手房间的地上睡觉；安德鲁太太和埃尔兹别塔也留在教堂，接替安德鲁的白班号手可以帮忙照顾她们。一路上，安德鲁先生和扬·康迪必须搀扶着炼金术士，因为他的双脚只能拖拉着走，就像梦游一样，但他每一步都勇敢地踏在地上，虽然并不清楚周围发生的一切，但他放心地跟着身边的这两个人，知道他们是他的朋友，而且他们要带他去一个好地方。

他们在城堡街右转，走上了去往瓦维尔城堡的斜坡。他们的背后是满目的疮痍，一条条街道在废墟中冒着黑烟，倒塌的木头还在燃烧着。废墟之中救灾的人们依旧忙碌不停，他们拆掉烧焦的木梁，从水车中取出成吨的水来灭火，现在这些水车已经全部由马匹拉动了。城堡街的一侧受灾严重，鸽子街上的房屋已经完全被烧毁，圣安街上也只剩下几处建筑。另外，贝克街、金匠街、犹太街和布罗德街都有不同程度的毁坏。

在去往城堡的路上，扬·康迪一行人被卫兵盘问了两次。不过当认出是善心的神父时，士兵就立刻放他们通行。约瑟夫又一次见证了扬·康迪的威信，不过，扬·康迪并没有因此而显出丝毫的傲慢，他在对待大多数世俗事情的时候，就像个孩子一样简单。不过他的名字确实像有魔力一般，在王宫也是如此。他们最后来到了瓦维尔山上的一个小通道前面，穿过这里就是王宫。这里的士兵举起手中的长矛向扬·康迪致敬，让他们等在这里，他进去通报。

卫兵很快返回来了，郑重地回答道：“国王陛下说，只要是扬·康迪神父的请求，他都会应允。只是，各位需要稍等片刻，等当前的会见结束。”

他们大约等待了十五分钟，然后一个身穿蓝袍，看起来手握重权的官员出来宣布国王卡济米尔·亚盖洛有请扬·康迪和他的朋友们觐见。

一行人跟在蓝衣官员身后出了通道，穿过一座开阔的庭院之后，踏上了左侧的大理石台阶，最后来到了露台。突然，一扇大门向后打开，他们就来到了国王的面前。

多年以后，约瑟夫还记得当时的情景，一切就像梦境一样，平静而淡然。卡济米尔国王在一间小接待厅接见了他们，他常常在这里接见一些不需要拘泥于仪式的特定人物，扬·康迪就是享有这项殊荣的人物之一。

约瑟夫和父亲单膝跪地，向国王行礼。国王坐在高背椅上，上面并没有华盖，只是椅背的顶端凿了一顶皇冠，正好和国王头顶的位置一样高，所以乍一看还以为皇冠是戴在国王头上的。国王身穿巨大紫袍，底部正好落在软皮鞋面上，巨大的领子上绣着不同颜色和样式的丝线；一条沉甸甸的金链子压着衣领的褶皱处，在衣领下面还隐约地可以看到绣着金线的华丽马甲；长袍的袖口宽松，一直垂到国王的膝盖；长袍边缘还覆着厚实的皮毛；国王头戴紫色的柔软帽子，帽子顶端平坦，在四边各折起一个小角。

国王看上去舒适随意，没有拘礼。他的卫兵却完全不同——他的两边各站着一名卫兵——他们身穿板甲，手臂、胸部和腿部的位置都有金属片遮盖。他们的腰间别着短剑，时刻保持着警惕。这两个卫兵像雕塑一样，守在那里一动不动。小厅的周围还有骑士，他们穿着不同的盔甲，有的穿着长裙一般的上衣，有的穿着棋盘纹路的护甲，从肩膀一直延伸到大腿，有的穿着铠甲和战靴，手里还拿着长矛。

国王的前面还有两个侍从，他们拿着权杖，站在那里一动不动。

扬·康迪正要上前行吻手礼，国王示意他不必多礼，然后开口问道：“这是怎么回事？这些是在昨天大火中受灾的人们吗？”

“是的，”扬·康迪回答道，“不过，我们并不是为此而来。我们还有一件更为重要的事情。这是恰尔涅茨基家族的安德鲁先生和他的儿子约瑟夫。他们本来住在乌克兰，但遭到了暴徒的袭击，所以来此觐见陛下。”

“那么，”国王马上产生了兴趣，对安德鲁说道，“请起，告诉我你的困境，我现在确实很感兴趣。我得到不少关于乌克兰的消息，都不是什么好消息。你遇到了什么事情呢？”

“多谢陛下，”安德鲁恭敬地回答道，然后站起身来，从衣服下面拿出了那颗水晶球，说道，“我想把这颗塔尔诺夫大水晶球献给您。”

当安德鲁举起水晶球的时候，阳光正好照在上面，整个房间和其中的一切都突然涌动起了五彩斑斓的光点。它闪烁着耀眼的光芒，几乎像闪电一样冲击着每个人的眼睛。国王一跃而起，从安德鲁的手中接过了这个宝物。

“这简直是奇迹！真美啊！”国王发出了惊叹，他身旁的卫兵也发出了低声的感叹。“世界上哪里还有如此精美绝伦的宝石呢？恐怕最精美的也不及这个的一半啊！”

“我也不清楚，”安德鲁回答说，“不过，我的家族多年来一直保管着这个水晶球。”

“那你为什么要把它交给我呢？”国王不解地问，“它的价值至少相当于我这王宫里四分之一的宝贝了。”

“请您听我解释。”安德鲁说道，“两百多年来，我们家族一直受托保管这个宝贝，我们发誓认真保管，除非它的藏身之处暴露，那样的话，就必须将它交给国王，以免发生危险。”

“那它的隐藏之处被发现了吗？不过，还是先告诉我，为什么要将这么精美的宝物藏匿起来呢？”

“陛下，这背后的原因说来话长。如果您非常想知道的话，今后我可以以书面的形式告诉您。现在，只能长话短说了。许多年前，鞑靼人攻陷了塔尔诺夫城，那里的人们就将这个水晶球交给我们家族的一员来保管。我的这位先人发誓即使付出生命代价也要保护好这个水晶球，以免它落入图谋不轨的人手里。因为塔尔诺夫水晶球的美丽背后隐藏着一些神奇的属性，它和巫术以及黑魔法有些关系，而且被看作一种诅咒，是神秘之物和邪恶的源泉。塔尔诺夫城重建后，住进了新的城民，而水晶球一直被我们的家族所保管着。”

“那这个秘密是怎么泄露的？”

“我家里的一个仆人，是鞑靼人，他在我身边多年。我习惯把这个水晶球藏在南瓜的外壳里，我猜这个人一定是多次看到我挖空南瓜并在上面涂抹油和橡胶进行保存。这个仆人头脑简单，所以我并没有刻意防备他。不过，后来证明，这个人虽然不聪明，但他并不缺乏好奇之心。正是由于好奇，他忍不住偷窥我，最终发现了我保存南瓜壳的原因。一年之前，这个仆人离开了我家，就在他离开的几个月之后，我家的房屋就遭到了袭击。我猜他肯定是把这个秘密卖给了某个鞑靼人首领。”

“那他知道这个水晶球的价值吗？”

“那我就不得而知了。我只知道，关于这个水晶球的故事在鞑靼人和哥萨克人之间广泛流传，他们小时候就听过这个故事，而且每个小孩都梦想着有一天能找到这个水晶球。”

“你这个美丽的水晶球，”国王盯着水晶球，说道，“你能不能告诉我们，人们为了得到你都做了些什么。你这个无情而神奇之物啊。”

安德鲁先生双膝跪倒在地，突然说道：“陛下！请您接受这个水晶球并守护它吧！”他的声音因激动而颤抖，眼泪已经滑过了脸庞。“这个东西已经给世间带来了太多的灾害，它对于我的家庭来说只是负担，是无尽的焦虑和痛苦的源泉。我的祖父多年以前甚至挖了一条地道，以便在受到袭击的时候，可以带着水晶球秘密逃走。这条通道挖得如此巧妙，以至于这么多年来，除了一家之主，别人都不知道它的存在。

“虽然这个宝贝很美丽，但我从心底憎恨它，不愿意再多看它一眼。它所发出的每一束光芒都吸引着成千上万人为了占有它而相互残杀；它身上隐藏的每一片色彩，都让整个国家苦不堪言。我一直尽心尽力地守护着它，但我无法继续保护它了。我已经履行了我的诺言。”

国王深深地注视着这颗水晶球，他突然打了一个寒战，好像在里面看到了可怕的东西。

“用不了几年，我就老了，”安德鲁先生继续说道，语气中充满了诚恳，“可我乌克兰的家已经不复存在了，我的房子也被烧毁，土地也已经荒芜。这一切皆是因为拥有这个水晶球而遭人嫉妒。”

安德鲁又讲述了他们一家人逃离乌克兰的经历，以及一路被追杀、住处遭遇洗劫、在塔楼被攻击、被纽扣脸彼得——也就是乌克兰人所知的恶人博格丹——不断骚扰。

“我不清楚是谁派人一路跟着我，但我的儿子约瑟夫告诉我您的亲兵在街上抓住了那个叫彼得的犯人。请让我和他对质，或许我能找到让我背井离乡的幕后真凶。”

在安德鲁讲述的过程中，国王渐渐将注意力从水晶球上转移开，当他听到彼得这个名字的时候，便激动得无法平静。

“这个人就在我手里，”他说，“应该把他带过来。最近我在乌克兰的密探报告说近期会有一场大叛乱，而这个叫彼得或是博格丹的人，在波兰的目的就是促成这种勾当。我的卫兵已经掌握了他的样貌，另外也提出悬赏。昨晚他们在大火肆虐的区域发现了他的行踪，就把他抓了起来。马上把他带来！”

两个持着长矛的士兵把彼得带进了接待厅。他走进来的时候，胳膊和腿上的铁链当啷当啷地撞击着地面。他并没有屈尊去看一眼安德鲁和其他人，只是看着国王，交叉着手臂，满脸不屑地站在那里。两名士兵把他强行压倒，让他跪在地上。

然而，当他的目光落到了放在国王身前地板上的塔尔诺夫大水晶球上，他那冷漠的表情很快就消失不见。他向左右两侧各瞟了一眼，充满厌恶地看着安德鲁和炼金术士。

“你被指控背叛了波兰联邦，”国王立刻说道，“你有什么要抗辩的吗？”

“谁指控的？”

“乌克兰的总督，”国王继续说道，“而且你还犯有其他罪行，其中包括迫害我面前的这位先生——你毁坏了他的房屋和土地，在他在教堂塔楼值班的时候攻击他。这其中的任意一条罪行都能被判死刑。”

彼得不论何时都保持着他的自信。他很快意识到给出的任何借口都将被驳回，所以立刻决定退一步采用别的手段来达到自己的目的。

“我要赎回我的自由。”他说。

“你有什么资本？”国王问道。

“很多。你在乌克兰的地位不保了。”

国王思考了一会儿，他真是不想看到这个彼得活下去，毕竟这个人做了那么多坏事，但是他也许真能提供一些有价值的信息。现在，整个乌克兰都处在骚乱之中，即使他最为信任的密探也无法查个水落石出。那个时候，从犯人口中获得消息的常用方法就是拷问，这在战场上更是应用广泛，但对于彼得这样的亡命之徒，从他嘴里拷问出来的消息几乎毫不可信。哥萨克人一般都是言而有信的人，而彼得身上有哥萨克血统，正因为如此，他才能以哥萨克人的身份在乌克兰和东方地带吃得开。

“我今天想要仁慈一些，”国王说道，“我已经听到了太多的苦难，而你的死也不足以弥补你所犯下的罪行，而你的消息说不定还能对联邦有所用处。虽然我可以通过拷问来得到这些消息，不过我更喜欢简单的办法……现在，你听着，”国王警告这个哥萨克人，说道，“我已经掌握了一些情报，都是我的手下从乌克兰带回来的，所以如果你敢说半句假话，我就会让人把你带出去，把你吊死在塔楼大门上。你明白吗？”

“我明白。”彼得回答道。听到国王的威胁，他的脸上泛出一丝苍白。彼得是个胆大包天的亡命之徒——要不然他也不会在失手两次之后，还敢冒险返回克拉科夫——他不惧怕死亡，但前提是他享有自由，能够战斗。但一想到绞刑，他就感到膝盖酸软，不由得害怕起来。他决定尽量实话实说，毕竟，他已经没有翻身的机会了，而且水晶球已经到了国王的手里，他肯定是拿不到了。

“有一件事，”彼得低声说道，“陛下，我只想恳求您一件事，不要让人知道我今天所说的话。如果有人知道我告了密，那我的小命可就这样了——”他打了个响指，“陛下，请您答应我。”

“我答应你。”

“那我就从头说起。我本名博格丹，乌克兰人都叫我‘恶人’。两年前的三月，一个有权势的人把我叫到莫斯科，他说一个大人物有话和我说。因为我总是对新活动充满兴趣，所以虽然我们哥萨克人不喜欢莫斯科人，我还是去了。然后，我就被带到了一个叫伊凡的人面前。”

国王打断他，说道：“你是说——”

“就是伊凡大公本人，莫斯科最有权势的人，那个瞎眼的人的儿子。他野心勃勃，有意将周边所有的国土纳入他的掌中，人们说他想成为皇帝。”

国王紧咬着双唇，眼睛眨了眨。“这些我都知道了，”他声音中透着愤怒，“我只想从你这里确认一下。伊凡！伊凡那个家伙，当面说要相互交好，一转身就又偷偷搞阴谋。”国王在房间来回踱步，过一会儿之后，他转身看着彼得，声音已经和刚开始时一样平静，“你继续说。”他命令道。

“他已经在一定程度上达到了目的，但他的欲望继续膨胀，他梦想着把权势扩展到国界之外，想要控制鲁塞尼亚和立陶宛。当他知道这些地方臣服于波兰，甚至被鞑靼人控制的基辅都甘心受波兰统治，就准备打击乌克兰的波兰人。有人建议他利用鞑靼人攻打波兰人，他已经派出使节打探鞑靼可汗的想法，挑唆他派兵攻打波兰人。不过，鞑靼可汗给出了一个令人意想不到的答复。”

“他是怎么说的？”国王连忙问道。

“他说他可以率军攻打乌克兰的波兰人，但是有一个条件，就是伊凡大公必须把塔尔诺夫大水晶球交给他。”

听到这里，所有人都大吃一惊，尤其是安德鲁先生，因为谁也没有想到这个水晶球竟然和这么重要的事情有关系。

“他怎么会知道塔尔诺夫大水晶球呢？”国王问道。

“东方人都知道塔尔诺夫大水晶球，”博格丹说道，“每个魔术师、占星师、首领、王公贵族都想得到这个宝贝。据说，这个宝贝不仅价值连城，而且能够预知未来，能从里面得到极有价值的秘密，可以从里面看到早已逝去的人。关于这个水晶球还有很多传奇故事，但鞑靼人占领了西部之后，它就从塔尔诺夫消失了，之后，很多人就开始寻找它。”

国王思考了一会儿，又问道：“那鞑靼可汗在向伊凡提出要求的时候，就不知道这是一个几乎不可能满足的要求吗？他是否是在委婉地拒绝攻打波兰呢？”

“陛下，不是这样的。”博格丹语气肯定地说道，“不久之前，一个在这个人家里当过仆人的人，”他指着安德鲁，“到了鞑靼人的地盘，四处宣扬水晶球的下落，说它就在乌克兰乡下的一户人家手里。可以肯定，这个消息传到了鞑靼可汗那里，他痴迷于各种奇珍异宝，而当我从莫斯科动身到了鞑靼境内，得知了这一切，伊凡就答应鞑靼可汗，说要尽力帮他得到水晶球。”

“你就是那个中间人？”

博格丹鞠了一躬。

“然后伊凡派你到安德鲁先生家夺取宝贝？”

博格丹又微微鞠了一躬。

国王的眼睛里充斥着怒火，厉声骂道：“你这条走狗！简直禽兽不如！你竟然为了达到你的目的，烧毁了人家的房屋，毁坏了人家的田地，居然还想要他们的性命！……上帝保佑！我掌握着王权，唯一的希望就是我的国家和平，睦邻友好，人民幸福。可是，波兰却屡屡被推到战争的边缘。敌人不仅仅在北边和西边威胁着我们，南边和东边还有人居心叵测扰乱我国人民的幸福。哦，波兰啊波兰，你的子民什么时候才能好好享受上帝为他们所创造的平静生活啊！”他转身面向博格丹，问道，“你，你还有什么可说的？”

“我最终还是失手了，”博格丹苦恼地说道，“我现在只知道我会得到自由，因为亚盖洛王室从来不食言。其实，要不是这个家伙——”他指着炼金术士，他一直站在大厅的后方，眯着眼看着眼前的一切——“我早就拿到水晶球了。”

国王没有理他。“把他带下去！”他对一个卫兵说道。

一个身着铠甲的队长上前听令。“明天一早就把这个博格丹送到弗洛里安城门口，让那里的守城卫兵把他送到边境，不过在到达边境线之前，不能解除他身上的枷锁。之后，就任他去吧。但是，如果他敢再次踏上波兰的国土，就马上把他抓起来绞死。”

卫兵把博格丹带走之后，国王对安德鲁先生说：“我以波兰国王的权利和责任，赞美你为这个国家所做的最为衷心的付出。你们家族多年来一直信守誓言并愿意为了曾经的誓言默默承受，这是一种非常难得、非常仁慈的举动。我要向你们表示衷心的感谢。”

国王从脖子上取下那条精美的金链。那是用最纯的金子打造而成的珍宝。

“戴上这个，”他一边说着，一边亲手把金链给安德鲁先生戴上，“这条金链将成为你们忠诚的象征，你们所损失的财产将由国家给予补偿，因为你的损失皆是出于对国家的奉献。如果水晶球被那帮恶棍交给鞑靼可汗的话，恐怕现在乌克兰已经落入鞑靼人和伊凡军队的手中了。等到合适的时机，我会给你一个更为正式、更为合宜的奖赏。”

这时，扬·康迪示意整个会见结束，然后一行人跪在地上向国王行礼。

国王也弯下腰，不过是去捡水晶球，在这个会见过程中，水晶球一直就放在他面前的地板上。约瑟夫注意到，当国王的眼睛注视着水晶球的那一刻，他就突然忘却了周围的一切，站在那里，像是进入了梦境一般，或是被人催眠了一般，深深凝视着那个美丽又可怕的水晶球。





第十六章　塔尔诺夫水晶球的归宿


约瑟夫和他的父亲还跪在地上，突然，意想不到的事情发生了，将这一天的局面彻底改变。这都是因为炼金术士克鲁兹。

其实，在整个会谈过程中克鲁兹都在仔细聆听，虽然他的眼皮耷拉着，但双方的每句话他都记在心里，每一次争辩、每一个手势、每一个决定都没有放过。就在这最后时刻，他从众人的身后一跃而起，好像一只扑向骨头的狗，一把从国王的手里夺走了水晶球。

克鲁兹怀里紧紧抱着水晶球，整个人像着了魔一般，径直冲出门去。一个卫兵被他撞倒在地，一脸错愕。

“拦住他！”扬·康迪喊道，“别让他做傻事。”

但已经来不及了。克鲁兹已经跑到了外面的露台，顺着台阶冲下庭院，那里的卫兵虽然一脸惊讶，却没有理由抓他，毕竟他是贵宾，是扬·康迪神父的同伴啊。他全速冲出了通向庭院外的小门。这时国王带领拿权杖的侍从也冲到露台，后面跟着卫兵，还有安德鲁先生和约瑟夫以及扬·康迪，国王赶紧向下面的卫兵喊话。下面的卫兵接到指令后立即开始追赶，并向远处大门边的卫兵呼喊。但炼金术士就像飓风一样穿过了城堡的大门，让城堡门口的士兵措手不及。他向城堡下面的草地奔去，然后又左拐，冲到了瓦维尔山脚下的维斯瓦河湾。

安德鲁先生和约瑟夫跟在卫兵的身后继续追赶着克鲁兹，国王和扬·康迪看清克鲁兹的去向后，迅速奔向城堡的一侧，从那里可以直接看到下面的维斯瓦河。炼金术士已经来到了河边，他在岸边转过身来，示意追他的人都停下来，否则就跳进湍急的河流。这个时节的水流能瞬间将人吞没。众人不敢贸进，只能无奈地站在那里，等克鲁兹说话。

“听着！”他喊道，先是看着岸边离他不远的追击队伍，然后抬头向上看看，扬·康迪和国王正靠着城墙垛向下张望着。

克鲁兹默默地站在那里，样子显得很奇怪，他的衣服跑乱了，头发也凌乱地飘在风中，脸上没有表情——精美绝伦的水晶球就在他手中。

“你们听着！”他提高了嗓门，几乎要尖叫出来，“是我从安德鲁先生那里偷走了水晶球，一见到这个水晶球，我就被它的美丽冲昏了头脑，忘掉了诚实与正直。它曾这样害过许多人。我看到它，便看到了几百年来所有的魔法师和占星师梦寐以求的东西，我看到了自己声名远扬，让全世界羡慕。我受到诱惑，然后堕落了，可我不希望看到这颗被诅咒的石头再带来更多的麻烦。”

他停下来喘息了一会儿，紧接着就迸发出一阵狂野的笑声。“那个叫特林的学生，”他喊道，“对，就叫特林，我以前教过他。因为我一直盯着水晶球，所以精神越来越差，他对这一切都了如指掌。他说只要我们掌握了炼铜成金的方法，就会拥有无限的能量，他指挥我盯着水晶球，以寻找炼金术的配方。可最终我找到了什么？……只不过是自己疯狂头脑的反映。而我们最终竟然给整个克拉科夫带来了贫困、痛苦和灾难。就是因为我们的疯狂，才让半个城市化为灰烬，让无数男女老幼无家可归，一贫如洗。”

说完这些话，他的声音已经虚弱无力，他站在那里，形影凄惨，肩膀耷拉着，头也低了下去。

“打住，伙计！我们都是你的朋友。”扬·康迪喊道。

“不，我这样的人没有朋友。可是，”说着，他突然直起身来，“这件宝物，就是它，引得人与人之间纷争不断，国与国之间战火纷飞——现在——我要在这里——做个了断！”

说完，他挺直了腰身，那一瞬间他就像个巨人，挥动手臂，用尽全力将水晶球抛向了空中。

阳光照在飞旋的水晶球上，折射出万丈光芒，天空和大地之间仿佛多了一个闪光的气泡，一个耀眼的星球。接着，它一点一点地下落，下落，下落——最终哗啦一声掉到了湍急的维斯瓦河的水流中，一时间激起的漩涡击打着奔流的水浪——不久，河水又恢复了原貌。

周围的人陷入了一片沉默。炼金术士的举动带着庄严、神秘、超自然的力量——他的表情是如此神圣美好，就像那逝去的水晶球一般。扬·康迪说：“事已至此，让我们祈祷吧。”然后，所有人都跪到了地上。简短的祈祷结束后，他们抬起头，发现炼金术士已经瘫倒在地，好像突然生病了一般。人们把他扶回了圣玛利亚教堂的塔楼，交给安德鲁太太和埃尔兹别塔照看。

与此同时，国王召见了扬·康迪，在一番协商和利弊权衡之后，国王决定不派人从河里打捞水晶球。虽然水晶球的美丽纯粹绝伦，但人们对它的贪婪已经造成了历史上太多的痛苦和不幸。要是打捞上来，该把它安放在哪里呢？要是有外族力量来夺取水晶球，国王的军队和瓦维尔城堡的防御水平能够抵挡住他们的攻击吗？毫无疑问，维斯瓦河是塔尔诺夫水晶球最为安全的藏身之所了。

于是，直到如今，塔尔诺夫水晶球从未被打搅，尽管几个世纪以来许多人都在苦苦搜寻它。一四六二年炼金术士克鲁兹的奋力一掷后，它一直沉睡在瓦维尔山下的维斯瓦河中。

安德鲁先生得到了一大笔补偿金，得以重建乌克兰的家园，当年他就回了家乡，还带上了埃尔兹别塔和炼金术士克鲁兹。在经历了水晶球事件之后，克鲁兹的健康受到严重影响，他在事情过后好几天才从昏迷中醒过来，尽管恢复了神志，但他已经记不起那段黑暗的经历。那个叫特林的学生肯定是在大火之后直接回到了德国的老家，因为再也没有人在克拉科夫见过他。几年后，他因为施魔法在当地小有名气，据传说他在施魔法的时候经常召唤魔鬼来帮忙。

约瑟夫一直在克拉科夫大学学习，直到二十二岁的时候，他回到家乡协助父亲打理家中产业。不久，他和自己少年时的好友埃尔兹别塔结成了夫妻……

故事到此就愉快地结束了，让我们以波兰人心中至高无上的一句话来告别，这一句话也是波兰国歌的开篇：

愿上帝保佑波兰！





尾声　未完成的音符


时光飞转，已是一九二六年。维斯瓦河已经不再绕过瓦维尔山，径直俯冲下克拉科夫平原，将克拉科夫城和卡济米尔城分割开来，而是奔腾到最西边，围绕着整个大平原，形成了一座新的城市。城堡、高塔和瓦维尔大教堂依旧如往常一样，骄傲地屹立在山上；几个世纪以来，圣安德鲁大教堂经历了大火的考验、战争的洗礼以及敌人的围攻，依然耸立在格罗兹卡大街上；老布楼被文艺复兴时期的能工巧匠雕琢得焕然一新，仍然位于中央广场的正中间。尽管这座城市已经摘掉了旧时的光环，国王也已经不再居于山上的城堡，然而时间赋予了这座城市新的荣耀，建立于十四世纪的大学以及各种美术、音乐、手工和贸易学校让这座古老的城市弥漫着浓厚的学术气息，吸引着波兰各地的学生们到这座庄严的城市求学生活。城市的每个角落都是哥特风格的建筑，随处可见逃过鞑靼人、哥萨克人或瑞典人蹂躏的罗马风格的墙垣或拱门。

不过，这座城市最主要的荣耀还是来自圣玛利亚教堂。原本从很远就能够被看到的大教堂如今已经被宫殿和建筑物重重包围，从远处只能看到它的两个塔尖。然而，当你慢慢靠近，就会被它的恢宏气势所震撼。它的静穆隐匿于高顶之上，在靠近时愈显凝重，仿佛成千上万只鸽子为抢食面包屑突然从四处一哄而下，给人一种压迫感。教堂下方是老城原来的墓地所在，外墙上供奉着墓碑和神龛，南门口还挂着紧勒罪犯喉咙的套索，罪犯们曾经站在那里请求上帝原谅并向虔诚的教徒们乞讨。教堂里面更是美轮美奂、名不虚传。四处都是精美的木雕，顺着廊柱抬头望去，是天蓝色的穹顶，上面还装点着星星。每个哥特式的凹槽处都有一座向下张望的石像——石碑、旗帜、圣坛、神龛，让整个教堂显得神圣而美丽。

听！是有人在吹奏乐曲吗？哪里飘来一串音符，仿佛天堂传来的上帝之声？那是从高塔传来的，此时教堂的钟正在鸣响，吹号手在高塔的窗口吹起音乐。这是什么曲子？正是《海那圣歌》，几个世纪之前鞑靼大军烧毁这座城市时，一位年轻人吹奏的就是这首曲子——听，号手在乐曲中途就突然停止了吹奏……他吹了四次《海那圣歌》，对着东、西、南、北四个方向的窗口各吹一次。听到号声响起之时，无论男女老少，都会想起年轻人坚守职责、为国捐躯的那段日子……从那时起，波兰经历了无数战火，几个世纪的战争，百年的沉沦。但《海那圣歌》每个小时都会被吹响，从未间断，每年都有人宣誓要至死不渝地履行职责。听吧，它现在又响起了。

愿它为人类带来和平！

THE TRUMPETER OF KRAKOW





Eric Kelly





To


Edward Lowell Kelly

Louville Howard Merrill





A TRUMPET FOR THE TRUMPETER


There was a boy, in the thirteenth century, whose courage and patriotism live on today in a certain trumpet-call, a tune "unfinished" because, as he once blew it, the arrow of an invading Tartar pierced his breast.

There was a boy of the fifteenth century who had reason to blow that tune, in the same tower, on the same trumpet, and to finish it, as a signal of another sort of enemy.

A man of the twentieth century, hearing the old broken tune played every hour, invented the second boy, when he wrote this book, a story partly true, and so exciting that it has won a place among the best-loved adventure stories of our time.

It must hold its readers engrossed, for it has overcome that strange name on the cover, "Krakow," a city by no means well known to tourists and before 1928 never used in a book for boys and girls. And neither school histories nor legends had celebrated a king so oddly named as "Kazimir Jagiello." But Mr. Kelly makes us share his own fascination for medieval Poland; he makes that strange, ancient city as real and exciting as he does his colorful cast of people. We are transported into a world of alchemists and armored knights, of a kind priest and a fearful villain, all seen through the eyes of young Joseph with him, we watch the great king do justice to his family, and see the wildly dramatic end of that fateful, ancienttreasure, the "Great Tarnov Crystal."

It is good to have one book, at least, for growing youth that opens a window on Polish history. When published in the fall of 1928, it won immediate critical praise. Boys and girls were as keen about it as reviewers; it was the sort of book to pass on as a special discovery. Within a few months of its publication one library wrote me that copy after copy had been "worn to shreds" on its shelves.

In Poland it was welcomed as "a symbol of new understanding and friendship between Poles and the valiant American people." In gratitude, the city councilors of Krakow loaned the author and his publisher one of the oldest of the silver trumpets still blown from the tower of the Church of Our Lady. At the Book Week meeting at the New York Public Library, Mr. Kelly was the speaker. Having told how the idea of the book came to him, as he haunted the church where the "broken tune" of the ancient hymn rang out, he stood with watch in hand.

"Now at the very moment when another trumpet blows in Krakow, you will hear that symbol of heroism known to every Pole, blown for you by a trumpet from Krakow."

He motioned toward the door, where I had brought a member of the New York police band. The tune rang forth, loud and spine-chilling. It was a great moment! No one knew that I had had to rush that burly policeman to the cellar to teach him the tune, since he could not read music.

The old trumpet went on display in its velvet-lined case, with flags on each side. It traveled all over America for a year, was shown in bookshops, and was blown in schools and libraries. By then, other less precious trumpets were being used in the old tower, as they are today.

When the book was awarded the Newbery Medal in 1929, in Washington, D.C., of course the trumpet rang out over the American Library Association meeting. Mr. Kelly's acceptance speech said, in part:

"I don't know if you call it song exactly, but it's a kind of vibration that issues from this city of Krakow that arouses a very tumult in my heart.... As I first came into Krakow after that great day when Poland rose from the grave, I suddenly heard the great bell boom over my head with its deep accent, and then the tocsin, the smaller bell, which drove the pigeons scrambling and shook them into the light like white snowflakes. As all were settling and there was but the fluttering of wings high in the air, there came from above that call of the trumpet, the Heynal.... I can't describe my emotions. I was so happy that I wanted to scream aloud. I wanted to sing and dance and stand on my head. My heart started to beat, gently but without speed, and seemed to be throwing off sparks of fire.

"That intoxication never left me. And later when I came back to study I did not let one day pass without spending some time within the walls of that church. I went there morning, noon, and night; late night, too, and very early morning.... I love it. It has sheltered every mood that my spirit has known and it has expressed every joy that there is in me."

The keen observation of a newspaper man had been fused with poetic emotion to produce this most unusual book.

Mr. Kelly's love of Poland began during the first World War, when he was sent to do relief work for the Polish legions in France; he returned with them when Poland was freed, to stay for threeyears. He was awarded three decorations by the government. Then in 1924, he returned to Poland for a year of lecturing and study, on a fellowship from the Kosciuszko Foundation in New York. Instead of the serious factual book he had intended to do, he was impelled by the place and the people to write this romantic novel.

After its success, he wrote two more stories of crises in Polish history, also a story for younger children, set in Poland, a Christmas tale called in Clean Hay, and other books. He taught English literature and Polish history at Dartmouth until he retired to live and write on an island off the Maine coast. There he died, in 1960. His teaching and his books live on, in both the countries he loved.

Ancient Oath of the Krakow Trumpeter


"I swear on my honor as a Pole, as a servant of the King of the Polish people, that I will faithfully and unto the death, if there be need, sound upon the trumpet the Heynal in honor of Our Lady each hour in the tower of the church which bears Her Name."





THE BROKEN NOTE


It was in the spring of the year 1241 that rumors began to travel along the highroad from Kiev in the land of Rus that the Tartars of the East were again upon the march. Men trembled when they heard that news and mothers held their children close to their breasts, for the name "Tartar" was one that froze folks' blood in their veins. As the weeks went on, the rumors grew thicker and there began to come through to Poland, our land of the fields, the news that the country lands of the Ukraine were ablaze. Then it was heard that Kiev had fallen, then Lvov, the city of the Lion, and now there was naught between the savage band of warriors and the fair city of Krakow save a few peaceful villages and fertile fields.

The Tartars came through the world like a horde of wild beasts. They left not one thing alive nor one green blade of wheat standing. They were short, dark men of shaggy beards and long hair twisted into little braids, and they rode on small horses which they covered with trophies that they had gained in war. Brave they were as lions, courageous they were as great dogs, but they had hearts of stone and knew not mercy, nor pity, nor tenderness, nor God. On their horses they carried round shields of leather and iron, and long spears often trailed from their saddles. About their shoulders and thighs they wore skins of animals. Some decorated their ears with golden rings—here and there one wore a gold ring in the nose. When theytraveled, the dust rose high into the sky from beneath the hoofs of their little horses, and the thunder of the hoof beats could be heard many miles away. They were so numerous that it took days for the whole horde to pass any one given point, and for miles behind the army itself rumbled carts bearing slaves, provisions, and booty— usually gold.

Before them went always a long, desperate procession of country people driven from their humble homes by the news of the coming terror; they had already said farewell to the cottages where they lived, the parting from which was almost as bitter as death. So it has always been in time of war that the innocent suffer most—these poor, helpless peasants with their carts and horses and geese and sheep trudging along through the dust to escape, if God so willed, the terrible fate which would befall them were they left behind. There were old people in that procession too feeble to be stirring even about a house, mothers nursing children, women weak with sickness, and men broken hearted at the loss of all that a lifetime of labor had brought. Children dragged themselves wearily along beside them, often bearing their pets in their arms.

To this company Krakow opened her gates, and prepared for defense. Many of the nobility and rich citizens had, in the meantime, fled to the west or taken refuge in monasteries far to the north. The brothers of the monastery at Zvierzyniec, a short distance outside the city, took in all the refugees that the building could accommodate, and then prepared to stand siege. But the great, weary, terror-mad mob that had fled ahead of the band of Tartars was content enough to make the city itself its destination. And once within its walls all turned their faces toward the south. For there, in the south of the city,towering on its rocky hill high over the Vistula River, was the great, irregular, turreted mass that was the Wawel—the fortress and castle of the kings of Poland from the time of Krakus, the legend king, and the home of the dukes and nobles who formed the king's court.

It had been decided to make no attempt to defend the city outside the castle gates, since that would entail a great loss of life; and so for several days the city dwellers who remained and these refugees from all the country about poured into the fortification and were housed inside its walls. The old castle gates which were then on Castle Highway opposite the Church of St. Andrew were at last shut and barricaded, and the walls were manned with citizen soldiery prepared to give their lives for the protection of the city and their families.

The Tartars fell upon the city in the night and, after burning the outlying villages, pillaged the districts that lay about the churches of St. Florian, St. John, and the Holy Cross. The whole night long was one of hideous sounds—the crackling and fury of flames, the snarling and yelling of the enemy when they found that the prey had fled, their roars of triumph when they came upon gold and treasure. As morning dawned the watchers from the Wawel looked out over the town and saw but three churches not already in flames. These were the Church of Our Lady Mary near the great market, the Church of St. Andrew, with its stalwart towers, at the Castle Gate, and the Church of St. Adaibert in the market place. Already a colony of Jews in the Black Village had perished, also those refugees and town dwellers who had not rushed inside the walls of defense. There remained but one man—or rather, a youth—still alive in the midst of all that destruction.

He was the trumpeter of the Church of Our Lady Mary, and he had taken solemn oath to sound the trumpet each hour of the day and night from a little balcony high up on the front of the church. As the first golden rays of the sun changed the Vistula from a dark line to a plash of dancing gold, he mounted this balcony to sound the Heynal—the hymn to Our Lady which every trumpeter in the church had in the past sworn to play each hour of the day and night—"until death." He felt with a strange joy the glow of the sun as it fell upon him that morning, for the night had been very dark both with its own shadow and with the gloomy blackness of men's ruthlessness.

About his feet, down in the town highway stood groups of short, fierce men gazing up at him curiously. Here and there the roof of a house was shooting upward in flames and belching forth clouds of black smoke. Hundreds of dwellings lay charred and ruined by the conflagration. He was alone in the midst of a terrible enemy—he might have fled on the previous day and gained the castle with the refugees and the town dwellers, but he had been true to his oath and remained at his post until he should be driven away. Now it was too late to retreat.

He was a very young man, perhaps nineteen or twenty, and wore a dark cloth suit that was caught at the knees with buckles, like the knickerbockers of a later generation; dark, thick hose extended from the knees to the tops of his soft, pointed sandals, and a short coat falling just below the waist was held together in front by a belt. The head covering was of leather and something like a cowl; it fell clear to his shoulders and ran up over the head in such a way that only his face and a bit of hair were visible.

My mother and sister are safe, he thought. May God be praisedfor that! They are gone these ten days and must be now with the cousins in Moravia.

It came to him then what a sweet thing life is. The sun over the Vistula was now reflected in the windows of the Cathedral of the Wawel, where the priests were already saying mass. At the tops of all the gates he could see guards in full armor, upon which the sunlight hashed. A banner with a white eagle hung in the air above the gate at the great draw.

Poland lives, he thought.

And then it came to him, young as he was, that he was part of the glorious company of Polish men that was fighting for all Christendom against brutal and savage invaders. He had not seen much of death before that minute—he had heard of it only as something vague. And now, he himself was perhaps going out to meet it, because of his oath, because of his love for the Church, because of his love for Poland.

I shall keep my word, he mused. If I die it shall be for that. My word is as good as my life.

Had a painter caught his expression then, he would have caught only the expression of a very great peace—an expression that signified somehow that God was very close. There was no moment of weakness, no faltering, no suffering even—for he did not think of what might come after his duty was performed. The sand in the hourglass already marked the hour for the trumpet to sound.

"Now, for Poland and Our Lady, I will sound the Heynal," he said, and raised the trumpet to his lips.

Softly he blew at first—then, thrilled with a sense of triumph, he felt in his heart a joy that was almost ecstatic. He seemed to seein a vision that though he might now die alone and for naught save what perhaps some scoffing ones might call a foolish honor, still that bravery was to descend as a heritage to the people to whom he belonged, and was to become a part of their spirit, their courage, their power of everlasting—all this that moment brought.

A Tartar below crouched to his bow and drew back the arrow as far as he could draw. The string whirred. The dark shaft flew like a swift bird straight for the mark. It pierced the breast of the young trumpeter when he was near the end of his song—it quivered there a moment and the song ceased. But, still holding to the trumpet, the youth fell back against the supporting wall and blew one last glorious note; it began strongly, trembled, and then ceased—broken like the young life that gave it birth—and at that moment those below applied the torch to the wooden church, and it, too, rose in flames to Heaven, with the soul of the youth among them.





I. THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T SELL HIS PUMPKIN


It was in late July of the year 1461 that the sun` rose one morning red and fiery as if ushering in midsummer's hottest day. His rays fell upon the old city of Krakow and the roads leading up to it, along which rolled and rocked a very caravan of peasants' wagons. They were drawn mostly by single horses hitched into place by the side of a rough pole that served for shaft; for wheels there were stout pieces of board nailed tightly together and cut round about, baked with fire at the rim to harden them; for body they had but rude cross boards as a floor, with sides and ends of plaited willow reeds, so that the wagons had the appearance of large baskets traveling on wheels. As they moved along a road often rough from holes and stones, out through fields sometimes, and even across streams, the wagons pitched about like little boats on a windswept sea.

In many cases the drivers were walking alongside the carts, flicking their long whips now and then above the horses' backs to give the animals a little encouragement, while upon the seats sat the patient figures of women and children.

In the wagon was all manner of merchandise—vegetables, flowers, ducks, hens and geese, pigs, butter and milk. Here a driver was conveying a load of skins, here one had nothing but black earth for enriching city gardens. Another, driving a load of poultry,wore around his neck, like beads, garland after garland of dried mushrooms strung upon strings. At the back of the picture rose the foothills of the Carpathians, misty and golden in the early sun, and at a distance the Vistula River curved like a silver bracelet about the Wawel Hill. All about was the early-morning smell of wet grass and fresh earth and growing things.

Market day had begun. All night some of these wagons had been traveling along the highways that spread out from the great highway that was the Krakow, Tarnov, Lvov, Kiev route. Some had been on the march for two days and two nights, so distant were the borders of the province. Here were men and women in town dress from the larger centers, here were barefooted peasants in long coats and round hats, here were peasant women in rough garments but with head scarfs and shawls of dazzling colors, here were the inhabitants of a Jewish village, twelve men in black robes and black hats, with the characteristic orthodox curls hanging down in front of their ears.

Here were boys belonging to the retinue of a local szlachcic, or country gentleman, their leather costumes showing up to advantage beside the rather dingy dress of the male portion of the peasantry. Here and there were women with little babies, here and there were old people trudging by the sides of their wagons up to market, as they had done for thirty or forty years past.

But every man in that caravan carried some sort of weapon, either a short knife at the belt, or quarter staff in the hand, or huge-headed ax at the bottom of the wagon. For thieves were abroad in great number at times of market, and it was even said that there were country gentlemen of ruined fortune who were not above recoupingthemselves now and then at the expense of some such caravan. Usually, however, it was on the return trip that the thieves were numerous, for then each villager and peasant had gold or silver as the result of the day's bargaining.

Although practically all these wagons carried cargoes of goods, there was one which seemed strangely empty for market day. It had two horses instead of the usual one, its shaft pole was stouter that those of the other wagons, its occupants were better dressed than the peasants and seemed somehow not like actual workers of the soil. In it rode the driver, a man of perhaps forty-five years, a woman—his wife—some ten years younger, and a boy, who sat at the open end of the wagon, dangling his legs above the dirt and mud of the highway.

"Now, wife," said the man, snapping a long whip at the off horse—his wife was sitting beside him on a rude seat at the front of the wagon—"that high tower you see is a watch tower on the Wawel Hill of Krakow. Should we go as flies the stork, we should reach there by the eighth hour. See, in the distance are the two towers of the Church of Our Lady. It is a welcome sight to my eyes after these three weeks on a rocking cart."

The woman threw back a gray hood from her face and looked ahead with longing eyes. "It is Krakow, then," she said, "the city of my mother. Often has she told me of its glory, and yet I never had hoped to see it. God knows I wish I might see it differently and with less pain in my heart. But God gives, and man receives, and we are here at last."

"Yes," said the man.

For a long time they traveled along in silence. The man was musing on his early experiences in Krakow, the woman on her losthome in the Ukraine, and the boy letting his imagination run riot in speculation as to the sights that he should see in the great city.

Their thoughts were brought suddenly from their own affairs to a commotion among the carts behind them. Drivers were reining in their horses and swinging them to the left of the road, narrow as it was, in order to let someone pass. The man whose thoughts had been thus interrupted turned around, trying to discern who it might be who was pushing forward through the long line of carts, and in a moment he saw that it was a rider on a small horse.

"Way, way," the rider was shouting. "Do you peasants think that the whole road belongs to you? ... Stay on your farm, where you belong," he shouted angrily at a peasant driver whose horse reared suddenly from the edge of the road to the middle. "Give me room to pass. You have no business on the highroad with an animal that jumps about like that."

"I had gone in the ditch else," replied the peasant without surliness.

The rider glanced sharply at the contents of the man's wagon, and being assured that it contained nothing but fresh straw to be sold to brick makers, dashed ahead until he was even with the cart which held the man and woman and boy.

The last named had been watching his advance curiously. Now this boy, Joseph Charnetski, was in his fifteenth year. He was not by any means handsome, though he could not be called ugly. His hair and his eyes were dark, and his face was somewhat round and very pleasant. He wore rather rich, though travel-soiled, nether garments, not leather like those of the retainers, nor of coarse sacking like the peasants' clothes, but of a good quality of homespun, and a thick,buttoned coat of the same material, which—fell skirt like nearly to the knees. On his feet were brown leather boots, whose tops were soft and loose, and so high that they reached almost to the bottom of the coat. On his head he wore a round hat like a turban.

The instant the rider perceived the boy, "Chlopak, chlopak [Boy, boy]," he exclaimed in a rather croaky voice, "tell your old man to hold his horses. You come and hold mine."

The boy obeyed, but as he leaped from the wagon and grasped at the horse's bit thong, he came to the conclusion that the stranger was no friend. In those days when the world was just emerging from a period of darkness and cruelty, it was a necessity that each man should be constantly upon his guard against other men. Robbers abounded—jealous friends often descended to mean tricks; men of noble birth and breeding thought nothing of defrauding poor peasants, and among the poor peasants themselves were those who would commit crimes for the sake of gold.

Therefore when Joseph grasped at the horse's bit rein he had already come to the conclusion, perhaps from something in the stranger's looks or speech or manner, that he was one to be treated with caution. He was attired in a retainer's suit of thick cloth. The jacket was short but concealed a coat of very light chain armor beneath. He wore for breeches not knickerbockers but a single leather garment that combined doublet and hose in one. The cap was round, with a hanging jewel, probably glass, dangling behind against his neck.

It was the face, however, that betrayed the soul beneath. It was a dark, oval, wicked face—the eyes were greenish and narrow and the eyebrow line above them ran straight across the bridge of thenose, giving the effect of a monkey rather than a man. One cheek was marked with a button like scar, the scar of the button plague that is so common in the lands east of the Volga, or even the Dnieper, and marks the bearer as a Tartar or a Cossack or a Mongol. The ears were low set and ugly. The mouth looked like the slit that boys make in the pumpkins they carry on the eve of Allhallows. Above the mouth was a cropped mustache, which hung down at the ends and straggled into a scanty beard. The man carried at his waist a short curved sword and from the inside of his jacket could be seen protruding the jeweled handle of an Oriental dagger.

No sooner had the boy caught at his rein than the man was off his horse and with a leap had gained the wagon. Joseph's father reached quickly under the wagon seat for a short cross-hilted sword.

"Not one step nearer," he shouted as the man came toward him with hand outstretched as if to take his hand. "Who you may he I know not, but I stand as a Christian till I find out what your errand is."

The stranger stopped, smiled at the ready sword still in its scabbard, though with a sudden respect in his smile, then pulled off his hat and made a bow. "I take it that you are Andrew Charnetski," he said.

"You take too much." answered the driver. "To strangers I am Pan[1] Andrew Charnetski."

The stranger bowed again. "I spoke as to an equal," he said. "I am Stefan Ostrovski of Chelm. But now I am come from Kiev, where I have been on state business. It is known that one Muscovite has some important business with our Lithuanian provinces, and I, though I may not say by whom, was sent to learn—" He broke off suddenly, as if wishing to give the impression that his business was such that he might not speak of it in public fashion. "Put on my way home, men told me that a band of Tartars had come north from the Krim, pillaging much of the country about. Among the houses which they had burned and the fields which they had destroyed were the house and fields of one Andrew Charnetski—nay, I ask pardon—of Pan Andrew Charnetski, who was reported to have escaped with his wife and son in the direction of Krakow, where they were said to have friends. This being true, and since I was traveling in the same direction, I sought a description of Pan Andrew and his family, and this morning when I saw a true Ukrainian cart, drawn by two horses and not by one, and bearing a man and woman and boy such as had been described to me, I took the assurance to present myself and make my greetings to you."

Pan Charnetski scrutinized the face, the clothing, and the figure of the stranger closely. "The half is not yet told," he said.

"Nay," answered the other, "but the rest is perhaps a tale for you and me behind some heavy door when we reach the city of Krakow just ahead. I have heard—" He spoke significantly; then with his hands he described a circle in the air.

Charnetski watched him with his eyelids drawn half shut so that he could focus his attention upon the man and see naught of the world outside. His heart was not so cold and steady, however, as one might think from looking at his calm, composed features. In truth, at the stranger's gesture his heart was beating a tattoo against his ribs. He knew that almost every word the man had uttered wasfalse; he knew that his name was not Ostrovski, even though there had been members of that family in Chelm—not one feature of the man's countenance was Polish. And there was that in the tone of the last words that had suggested a threat. Charnetski realized also that here was no chance meeting. It was fourteen days and more since they had left the border. This man, he reasoned, had followed them all that distance, or had perhaps been sent by some person of higher rank to intercept them before they gained entrance to the city.

"You have heard naught that concerns me," he answered shortly. "And now, since the carts are leaving me behind, will you kindly return to your horse? I have nothing to say that will be of importance to you, nor do you interest me in any way."

Charnetski spoke truly, for the carts ahead were already some distance away and the drivers behind were shouting at him angrily for blocking the traffic.

"On the contrary," answered the stranger, "you have that which interests me greatly. And I will not leave you until we are safe behind some door in the city. Here, boy," he shouted at Joseph, "lead my horse along behind the wagon, for I intend to ride the rest of the way."

Pan Charnetski's cheeks blazed. "Now, by the lightning, you make yourself too free here," he articulated. "State what business you have quickly and be done."

The man glanced around the cart and he saw on the wooden floor just in front of the driver's seat a huge yellow pumpkin. "Ha," he said, "a pumpkin, and at this time of the year. I suppose they raise pumpkins in the winter on the steppe. What shall be the price of that pumpkin?"

"It is not for sale," answered Charnetski.

"No?"

"I said no."

"What if I offer its weight in gold?"

"All's one."

"You will not sell?"

"I tell you, no."

"Then"—the stranger drew his sword quickly—"then you will fight for it!" And he stepped forward toward the driver.

Charnetski hesitated no longer. In the flash of an eye he had vaulted across the seat, dodged a blow of the saber, and caught the stranger's right wrist in a grip of steel. The sword dropped with a clang. Charnetski did not let the man go, however. He threw his left hand into the small of the stranger's leg and with clutch upon arm and leg hoisted him high and tossed him out of the cart. He fell in the mud, sputtering with rage and calling curses of every description upon Charnetski's head. And at this minute Joseph, with admirable foresight, swung the man's horse about and struck him smartly upon the right flank. The horse reared and capered, then dashed off down the road in the direction from which the wagons had come; at the same instant the boy leaped upon the cart and shouted to his father, who climbed back to the seat and swung the long lash over the horses' heads. They were off in a second, leaving the stranger in the middle of the highway, turning now to the right and now to the left as if uncertain whether to pursue his horse or his enemy. And Charnetski, swinging about, picked up the sword from the bottom of the cart and hurled it into the road.

Some time later they reached the Kazimierz, the Jewish cityfounded by King Kazimir more than one hundred years earlier. Passing through this, they came to the bridge across the Vistula which would admit them to the city of Krakow itself. Finding, however, that this bridge was undergoing repairs, they were forced to take the next bridge to the north; thence they proceeded to the fortified gate called Mikolayska, where they were challenged by the gatekeeper.

II. KRAKOW


"Charnetski, Christian, wife and son," said Pan Andrew to a custodian who wore light armor and carried a halberd.

He gave them a quick glance and motioned for them to pass. Another man in black peered into the cart to see what was inside, and finding nothing, concluded that these were farm folk come up to the city to buy, and accordingly demanded but a few pieces of iron coin as tax. This paid, they took the road which ran from Mikolayska Gate to the Sukiennice, the old Cloth Hall, which stood then, as it does today, in the very center of the city.

Krakow was flooded with a golden sunlight. Joseph, who saw for the first time a large city, gaped in very astonishment as he glanced left and right about him.

Front and rear, their cart formed part of the long straight train of carts coming to the city loaded with products of the farms. Through this line were breaking from time to time splendid horsemen wearing breastplates of steel that shone like precious metal and carrying long swords dangling from the saddles. One of these men who pushed through the crowd just in front of their horses was so splendidly arrayed that the boy took him for a very high noble, or perhaps the king himself, the peace-loving king, Kazimir Jagiello, the fourth of the name of Kazimir, and he exclaimed:

"That must be the king, Father. See the shining armor and thejewels upon his saddle. And the sword must be of gold, for it shines like fire. And look"—he pointed eagerly—"see the Polish eagle worked in silver upon the saddlecloth. There beyond it is the white knight of Lithuania. Is he not indeed the king?"

"No, son, no. That is but one of the guard that waits on the nobles at the royal castle."

All about them rose in the bright sunlight palaces, churches, towers, battlement walls, and Gothic buildings, as yet for the most part unadorned by the rich sculpture that was to come in a few years under the influence of the Italian Renaissance. In the distance rose against the turquoise-blue sky the cathedral on the Wawel Hill, its Romanesque tower showing high above the city. Close at hand were the two towers of the Church of Our Lady Mary, not as they appear today since the hand of the master architect and of the renowned sculptor Wit Stwosz altered them, but rising unbelfried and uncrowned above the cemetery, where white gravestones clustered at the base of the church.

In the very middle of the market, surrounded by smaller wooden buildings, was the great Cloth Hall, used for the sale and exchange of cloth goods, already swarming with merchants who had been traveling all night, and for many nights perhaps, in order to close bargains early on market day before the money of purchasers had been spent elsewhere.

Camped in the square outside the Cloth Hall were a number of Tartars who had come from the distant East to sell fine swords and cloths and jewels plundered from Muscovites, or Bulgarians, or Creeks, or other travelers in the steppes. Facing the east as the rising sun had crept over Wawel Hill, they had chanted their morningprayer of praise to the great Allah. Their singing could have been heard mingling with the clashing of the great bell on the Church of Our Lady Mary and the chanted service of the Armenian merchants who had come in from Trebizond and the lands beyond the Black Sea with carpets and spices and fine rugs.

Here for the moment in this great international capital of East and West was worshiped every god that man knows; it might even be said that God himself was worshiped under many names and in many languages and dialects. Here were Turks, Cossacks, Ruthenians, Germans, Flemings, Czechs, and Slovaks, with their wares to sell, and Hungarians with their wines from the mellow plains of Transylvania.

As for money, there might be found zloty and guilder and groschen, silver in bars, and precious stones, also plenty of token "in kind"—that is to say, certain varieties of merchandise such as amber, dates bound in packages, or even vegetables in containers, each of which had a recognized value over all the trade routes of the Hanseatic League. For the League merchants were represented here as well—prosperous Germans or Dutchmen in long robes with fur collars—and they did business in every language known to man.

While the boy drank in these unusual sights on all sides, there suddenly floated down from above the sweet notes of a trumpet. Looking directly upward he could see the golden bell of a trumpet protruding from one of the tower windows of the Church of Our Lady Mary, and as he looked the full dignity of the church burst upon him, its quiet strength which appealed to the eye being strangely mingled in his senses with the trumpet song which fell upon his ears.

There were two towers rising high above the traffic of the street; rising unequally, he now noticed, for the nearer tower seemed a bit squat beside the farther one. It was from the higher tower that the trumpeter was playing.

The tune was a little morning hymn, the Heynal, brought into Poland, some said, in the earliest days of Christianity by missionaries who came from the south. It was a simple little air, intensely sweet and appealing, but at a certain place the trumpeter broke the tune off abruptly, leaving but the echo of an unfinished strain to float down from above. It was as if someone at that moment had taken the trumpet from his lips.

Joseph turned to his father in astonishment. "Isn't he going to finish the song?"

The father smiled. "It is a long story, my son, and one that I will tell you at a later time."

The trumpet sounded again, from another window, then from the farther side, and finally at the north side, toward the Florian Gate. Four times the trumpeter had sounded the Heynal, ending always with the broken note.

"He plays rather poorly," added Pan Charnetski.

Now, though Pan Charnetski was a country gentleman, he was accomplished in many crafts. After having graduated from the University of Krakow, he decided not to remain in one of the professions but rather to live on his father's estate and manage it, as had been the custom for the men in his family. He had retained a love of music, which he had studied in the university, and played well upon brass instruments, the straight trumpet, the curved trumpet, and the trumpet with keys. Therefore when he said that thetrumpeter in the tower had not played well he knew of what he was talking.

The cart was now passing close to the Cloth Hall, and Joseph ceased to question his father any further concerning the song with the broken note because of the strange scenes which claimed his attention.

Here stood a group of merchants in bright gowns. Wealthy they must have been because their long coats were of fine cloth, some lined with fur and trimmed with many silks. Beneath the coats were costumes of tight-fitting cloth. Joseph saw one man with the color of the cloth in the trouser of the right leg different from the color of the cloth of the left trouser, which to the boy had a ludicrous look. But when he noticed that many other men wore the same kind of garment, tight-fitting to leg and thigh, and of different color upon each leg, he ceased to smile and began to wonder. The wonder did not leave off for a while, either, for other curiosities in dress caught his eye. The hats and head coverings were in their way as remarkable as the tight garments. Turbans were worn uniformly, some with pointed peaks, others simply masses of gayly colored cloth heaped up high on the head in twists and folds; grotesque ornaments, too, were worn on the head—one man even had a stuffed or an imitation rooster, with legs and comb and all, perched on the crown of his high hat. The merchants wore curious leather footgear, most of the sandals being of soft leather with long, twisted points. One man had sticks thrust into the leather at the toes, making his sandals appear at least two feet long.

At the stalls around the Cloth Hall were all manner of wares, which the sellers were advertising with loud cries. Here was a graincounter with different colored grains in open sacks. A woman in a blue gown which hung from a yoke at the shoulder, and with a piece of cloth of the same color wound deftly around her head for a hat, was selling a few grains of corn to a traveling musician. He wore a long yellow garment all of a piece, including head covering like a cowl, and falling to the knees, below which the legs and feet were bare. This garment was caught at the waist by a bright yellow belt. He carried under one arm a bagpipe with three protruding tubes, two for music, if it might be called such, and one for his mouth. In one hand he held a pouch of leather into which the woman was slipping grains of corn.

The Charnetskis drove by the stalls and shops of the glove makers, where there were women working and buying, all dressed in bright-colored gowns; past the needle makers in leather aprons, who sprawled over benches; past the sword makers, with their neat forges and rows of shining steel blades; past the tub makers, who were assembling wooden staves into tub bodies; past the smiths in their long black aprons, leading horses into position where they could be shed. Here and there the red signs of the barber and bloodletter, here and there the huge flasks of green and blue denoting the stores of the apothecaries. True Catholics had upon the walls of their shops an ikon or a picture of the Holy Mother of God from the sacred shrine of Chenstohova; almost every merchant had some distinctive figure above the door of his shop to distinguish it from his neighbor's; for example there was a hatter with the sign "Under the White Elephant," and there was a shoemaker who had a stone head of Kazimir the Great for the satisfaction of himself and his customers. The numbering of public buildings was not known in that age, andbuildings were distinguished by some such emblem, which usually stood above the outer gate or door.

Everywhere could be heard the cries of vendors shouting or singing their wares or professions, the flower girls, the knife sharpener, the baker's boy, and the butcher's apprentice.

"Co brakuje, co brakuje?" they all shouted in a chorus. "What do you lack? What do you lack?"

Occasionally, to Joseph's delight, a monkey could be seen, brought here by traders from the east or south, one playing around a booth, another carried, much bedecked with ribbons, in the arms of some merchant's or perhaps burgomaster's lady.

Once or twice amid the clamor of the market rang the clanking of chains as poor wretches about to be fastened to the church walls by iron collars, or stuck in the pillory, or perhaps even to suffer a worse fate, were marched to the church for a last prayer before the sentence of the law was passed upon them. Life was a precarious thing in many ways in those days, and men and women for very slight offenses were beheaded or banished or thrown into prisons.

Now they passed a procession of pilgrims on the way to some shrine, men and women from the villages dressed in their good clothes with the parish priest marching ahead of them and leading the chant which they were singing. The cross bearer was a young man with stalwart shoulders and bright eyes; he had need of his strength, too, for he had sworn to carry the holy image of Our Lord from his native village to Chenstohova, which was many miles distant. This company had already been on the road about ten days. There were boys and girls, too, in the procession, and some had their minds upon serious things, but others were looking for the first timeupon the glory of medieval Krakow, and would no doubt in their prayers ask forgiveness for too much attention to worldly things.

The cart turned into Grodzka, or Castle, Street, after leaving the market place and went directly toward the Wawel. Near the Wawel Pan Andrew swung the horses to the right and passed through a city gate and into a meadowy lane. In front of a large rambling palace that stood there, he drew up by the side of the road and leaped to the ground not far from a pair of iron gates that marked the entrance. At these gates he was accosted by an armed guard who, with a rather hostile air, blocked the entrance completely with his spear.

"What do you want?" he asked sharply.

"I seek Pan Andrew Tenczynski."

The guard shouted something, whereat five men in armor came running from a little house near the gate.

"Surround him," said the guard. This was done much to the astonishment of Pan Andrew. "One of you run to the house and call the captain," next ordered the guard. "Tell him that a countryman is here demanding to see Pan Andrew Tenczynski."

Pan Charnetski, trying to force his way out of the circle, was pushed back into the center by one of the armed men. At that he raised his voice in anger: "Who are you that dare detain me here? I am Pan Andrew Charnetski, first cousin to the Tenczynskis and proprietor of an estate in the Ukraine. I demand that you confront me with an officer in authority and not treat me like one come here as an enemy."

The men of the guard looked at each other in astonishment. Was it possible that this man did not know the truth—the report of which had already spread over the greater portion of Poland?

The captain came in a moment with the returning soldier. He broke through the ring and walked straight up to Pan Charnetski. "What is your business here?" There was certain pleasantness and courtesy in his voice that made Pan Andrew forget his anger for the moment.

"You have a civil tongue, young man," he answered. "I take it that you are in command here?"

"I am."

"Then I will tell you, as I have told your soldiers, that I am Pan Andrew Charnetski, come this day from the Ukraine to see my cousin Pan Andrew Tenczynski on important business."

"You come too late," answered the captain. "It is strange that you have not heard, for this news is now all about the country. Pan Andrew Tenczynski lives no longer. His kin have departed from the city for a time, and may return I know not when. I am here for the observance of order, for the protection of the estate against enemies of the family."

Pan Andrew started. "My cousin is dead—and how?"

"It was like to nothing the city has seen these many years. For a long time there had been hot blood between the tradesmen and nobles. The issue came to a head through the dissatisfaction of Pan Tenczynski over some piece of armor that he had bidden a smith to make. He not only took the tradesman to task but refused to pay for the work he had done, whereat the whole guild rose against him. They pursued him through the streets and killed him in the Church of the Franciscans, where he had sought shelter. It was a sad and grievous thing, and his family for fear of the mob fled the city. The gentle Elizabeth, our queen—and may the blessing of Heaven beupon her!—hates all strife that may result in the shedding of blood, and she it was who persuaded our king to make peace between the townsfolk and nobles. He sent us here to protect this house, to be a guarantee against the shedding of any blood, for there are many who would willingly pillage this dwelling and kill the servants that are still here. We are but acting upon orders when we detain all persons who seek entrance here, and for the execution of these orders you must give us your pardon, since we seek but to avert further bloodshed."

It seemed to Pan Andrew at that moment as if heaven had fallen about his ears.

"Let me give to Pan one piece of advice," continued the captain.

"Most willingly will I receive it," said Pan Andrew thoughtfully.

"Get yourself from the city as quickly as possible if you be of any blood ties with the Tenczynskis, or else, if you stay, change your name and manner of speech lest some assassin make a mark of you for the benefit of his party.... I greet you then with a hail, as is befitting between equal Pans, and request that, for your own safety, you depart quickly."

"But—I must remain here. A band of pillagers, I know not whom exactly, though I think them the paid robbers of someone in high authority, have burned my house in the Ukraine and left not one stone upon another. My fields are ruined as well, and I am here to take refuge with my kinsmen, to bring them word of something very secret, which must go at once to the ears of the king himself."

"Alas," answered the captain, "I can give you but little help. The king is at this moment in Torun, where there are said to be plans against the military order of the Knights of the Cross—for he seeksthere in the north peace at all odds. When he will return I know not, perhaps in a month, perhaps in a year. If you would await him here, I would, if I were you, settle in this town and take another name. Later there will come a retribution for these dark deeds against the Tenczynski family, and there will be more crows about the gallows."

Saying which, he turned away and called the guard again to its post.

Pan Andrew, however, stood motionless for a few seconds. The thoughts fairly burned in his brain. His friends, protectors, gone! The king away, he himself a fugitive here no less than in the Ukraine. From every side enemies pressed upon him, and what had he done to deserve such a fate? He was in a predicament even without this complication, for here he was in a great city where he had not a single friend. He had but little money, for what he had gathered had been invested year by year in his house and lands in the Ukraine. There were his wife and his son to be put in a place of shelter, and not only were the means lacking but there was even peril at every hand. Behind him at the gates of the city had appeared one foe— here in the city there were apparently many others. What to do? ... Well.... Let God give.... There would be something.

Aimlessly he got into the wagon, turned it about, and made for the market again. There at least they might spend the day, procure water for the horses, and buy a little of something to eat. He found a place near one of the springs, unloosed the horses with the help of his son, and let them crop the short grass that grew near one edge of the market place, watering them with buckets that he filled at the spring.

Not until then did he seek comfort and counsel from his wife,who had always been his solace at such times; throwing himself down beside her on the wagon seat, he told her the story of his late discoveries, the absence of the king, the death of his kinsman. For a second the woman's heart quailed before the fresh difficulties, but she forgot self at the look in her husband's face. Her quiet reply, "We will wait, for God is in the waiting," filled him with courage again.

Joseph, however, was at that age when no sky remains long clouded. His heart had been beating fast with excitement ever since the sight of the city's towers had loomed before them in the early morning, and his legs had been itching to get out of the wagon and explore the place. He began by taking a short excursion over to a little building near by, which at first glance had seemed to be a market building, but, when he approached it, proved to be a church with a low dome and round side windows. Although the church was of much interest to those who favored historical lore as being one of the oldest churches in Poland, it did not interest the boy greatly. He scrutinized the beggars at the door, a young boy with but one leg, a woman with a back bent to a curve, an old man with sightless eyes, praying continually, and many other wretched alms seekers. Crossing himself and muttering a prayer for God's helpless creatures, Joseph turned and marched down Grodzka Street in the direction of the Wawel.

He had just come to a cross lane which led on the left to the Church of the Dominicans, and on the right to the Church of All Saints, when he noticed a Tartar boy in the street leading and constantly beatings a large Ukrainian wolf dog. The wolf dog was on a leash—he had a strong hand-wrought collar about the neck— and he was turning now and then to glance back at his tormentor,who was plying a short Cossack whip. Joseph watched the boy in amazement, wondering why he had the dog and why he was beating him—as a matter of fact, the boy was acting out of pure viciousness—but neither of these questions found satisfactory solution in Joseph's mind. In a very few minutes, however, another question rose with the suddenness of lightning, a question which required action for a solution, and this action Joseph was able to supply.

For at the moment that the boy and dog were crossing the church lane, there emerged from the farther foot walk a man dressed all in black like a priest, but wearing a collar which was not clerical, since it opened in the front. He did not, however, for the moment attract Joseph's attention; it was his companion that caught and held the boy's gaze. For the companion was a girl of perhaps the same age as Joseph—she was walking by the side of the man in black and now and then grasping at his hand.

Joseph saw the dog no longer. His eyes were riveted on the girl. She seemed to him like an angel taken out of a Christmas play, or a spirit from a Festival of the Three Kings—in truth, she might have been one of those beautiful figures come to life out of the wondrous stained-glass windows in the church. Her hair was light—Joseph's was dark. Her skin was as white as the finest linen, her eyes as blue as the skies above the Vistula; she wore a cloak like garment of red that fell from her shoulders to her ankles and was girdled at the waist. It was embroidered in blue, with lace at neck and wrists; in front it did not meet completely but showed the second garment that she wore beneath, a mantle of blue that fell in folds even below the outer coat. And as she looked up, the country boy thought that he had never seen anything prettier on earth—so daintily she trippedalong that she seemed to walk on clouds. Then for a moment he looked down at his hands, dirty, hard, and grimy; he looked at his clothes and found them dusty and worn after the long journey.

But if he had been in heaven at the sight of the girl, he came back to earth quickly. For the Tartar boy with the dog and the man in black with the girl were close together at the crossing of the roads when suddenly the maddened dog turned desperately at bay upon his tormentor and crouched for a powerful spring. Joseph shouted and rushed forward just as the dog leaped. The Tartar boy dropped the leather thong in a flash and darted down the walk out of reach of the dog's jaws, but leaving directly in his path the man in black and the girl. Blind with fury the dog sprang again, and in an instant he would have come down upon the girl, who happened to be on the outside, had not Joseph at the same moment leaped and caught at the dog's heavy collar.

He had dealt with dogs many times in the Ukraine, and he knew that no dog is vicious if healthy and well treated; therefore there had been no fear in this effort that he made, save for the peril, perhaps, that the dog might mistake him for the boy who had been beating him, and sink his teeth into his flesh.

His fingers caught the collar squarely. The grip held, and he went hurtling through the air like the tail of a skyrocket, as the dog's leap, weighted by this unexpected load, fell short and the girl drew back with a cry. But Joseph and the infuriated animal went rolling to and fro in a wild embrace on the hard surface of the road, he striving to make the beast pay attention to his words, the dog only becoming more and more frightened. But the boy knew, after the first second when all depended upon whether his grip held or not, that everythingwas safe and he could successfully avoid the paws and teeth of the dog. Thus at a favorable moment he released his hold quickly upon the animal's collar and scrambled to his feet while a very dusty and possibly ashamed wolf dog tore off like a streak of lightning in the direction of the Franciscans' church.





III. THE ALCHEMIST


Something heavy but kindly fell upon Joseph's shoulders and something light touched his cheek.

Looking up quickly from a survey of his garments, now more ragged and dusty than ever, he perceived that the weight was the hand of the man in black and that the lightness had been a kiss upon his cheek from the man's companion—her cheeks were Bushed and her eyes bright and her lips were still close to him. He was somewhat dazed from the shock of going to earth so quickly with the dog, but he thrilled with pleasure and happiness from the kindly touch and the kiss.

He stepped back to brush himself, and then gazed squarely at the man and girl.

His cheeks grew rosy with that first meeting of eyes. For in the man's there was an ocean of gratitude and a suggestion of a tear, and the girl's eyes blazed forth frank admiration.

"You were so quick," she exclaimed. "Would that I could spring like that. It was brave of you—"

His tongue found no words. Boys of fifteen, even if aged by experience, have little to say when praise is bestowed so freely.

Moreover the man gave him no opportunity. "Remarkable," he said, "remarkable. As swift a leap as I ever saw," and then blinking with his eyes as if the light hurt them, added, "or hope to see."

"It was nothing," Joseph stammered. "Often in the Ukraine I have dispersed dogs in a fight." And then thinking that this perhaps sounded like boasting, said further, "As do many boys of my age in that country."

"From the Ukraine?" The man in black looked at him with interest. "How do you happen to be so far from home?"

"Tartars or Cossacks burned our house. We have been traveling this day more than two weeks in a cart only to find ourselves homeless here. Father had kinsfolk in this city, but the head of the house is dead and the others are away."

"Where are your people now?"

"In the market place."

"H'm," the man muttered to himself, "homeless and in the market place. And what will they do?"

The boy shook his head. "I think that my father will find us some shelter," he said finally. "He was thinking—" He hesitated, for he had been taught never to speak of troubles before strangers, though the girl peered straight into his eyes with great kindness and sweetness.

There is something curious here, thought the man. The boy's face has a high degree of intelligence and his speech is the speech of one who has listened to good words. A noble action this—I think in good faith that the whelp might have had his teeth in the child's throat.

Looking down upon the boy he said, "You have rendered us a noteworthy service, you have saved my niece from much painful injury; will you not accompany us to our home that we may hear your whole story and perhaps in our turn—"

The boy's face reddened. "Nay," he said, "I wish no reward. What I did—"

The girl caught him up. "Indeed you do my uncle wrong. He meant but this: we live humbly, will you not come and rest for a moment until you may join your people?"

"I ask pardon," the boy said quickly.

Whereat the man laughed, for their speech and expression had been over serious for children, though it still was an age when children grew to be men and women often over a single night. In some provinces girls of fourteen or fifteen were considered grown women and even given in marriage. Boys at that age had seen much of the rough side of life, of war and battle and cruelty.

"I will go with you," Joseph added, kissing the cuff of the gown of the man in black as he had always been taught to do in his home.

They turned to the left past the Church of the Franciscans, to the right through a short lane, and then to the left again into the most curious street of the world of that day.

It was the Street of the Pigeons, famed throughout all Europe as the dwelling place of scholars, astrologers, magicians, students, and likewise doctors, brothers of the Church, and masters of the seven arts. In the worst end of the street, the upper end near the city wall, clustered the squalid dwelling places that were once the homes of Jewish refugees, fleeing from persecution in all parts of the world. Terrible poverty had existed there, and when the Jewish inhabitants finally moved to their own city, Kazimierz, across the river, the buildings which they left were scarcely fit for human beings to live in. They were, in the first place, very old and out of repair—they were built for the most part of wood, though the fronts on the streetswere sometimes of brick covered with rough cement or mortar. The upper stories usually overhung, and the roofs were covered with loose boards nailed in place, serving instead of tiles or shingles. Rickety staircases on the outside of these buildings led from the streets or from interior courts up to the dwelling places on the third and fourth floors, where, at the time of this story, lived family literally heaped upon family in terrible disorder and poverty.

Thieves and murderers crouched there in hiding during the day, bands of lawless men had their haunts there in cellar or attic or other den. A fire in the year 1407 had swept through this street and through St. Ann's, clearing out many of these undesirable places, but unfortunately not destroying all of them.

In the lower end of the streets on the side toward the University of Krakow there was more respectability, since students and masters of the university inhabited there. A large students' bursar, or dormitory, stood near the corner where Jagiellonska now meets the Street of the Pigeons. In this lived many students; others put up near by in groups or with private families, since it was not until late in the 1490's that the authorities compelled the students to live in university buildings.

The prestige of the various colleges and the reputation of the men who taught there had drawn to Krakow not only genuine students but also many of the craft that live by their wits in all societies, in all ages—fortune tellers and astrologers, magicians and palmists, charlatans, necromancers, and fly-by-nights who were forever eluding the authorities of the law. Here, somewhere on the Street of the Pigeons, they all found lodging.

In the rooms above the street, in the kitchens beneath the street,these men plied their trades. Self-termed astrologers read in the stars the destinies of the gullible; they foretold happiness to trusting peasant girls who came to them for advice in their love matters; they prophesied disaster to mer-chants who, held by fear, might be induced to part with much money; they cheated, they robbed, and often on provocation they killed, until after many years they gave the street a certain unsavory reputation. Against the machinations of these men the influence of the university was ever working, and the first great blow that many of these magic crafts and black arts received was struck by Nicholas Kopernik, better known as Copernicus, many years later, when Joseph Charnetski was a very old man; Copernicus, working with rough implements, even before the telescope had been invented, proved to men for the first time that the heavenly bodies, stars and planets, move in the skies according to well-fixed and definitely determined laws, subject only to the will of the Creator of the universe, and that they have nothing to do with the destinies of individuals.

All about them in the street flitted men dressed in long robes like that of the guardian of the little girl, though all the robes were not alike. Some were clerical, with closed front and collar; others were open and flowing, with great sleeves like a bishop's gown; some were of blue, some were of red, some were of green. Joseph noticed one robe of ermine over which was worn a chain of heavy gold, at the end of which hung suspended a great amethyst cross.

They passed a house, part wood and part stone, where were gathered at opened doors a great group of young men in plain black robes, much less sumptuous than some others which they had seen, all the members of the group engaged in a lively altercation, as theguardian informed the boy and girl, concerning the movement of the stars. One was contending that the firmament of stars moved for one hundred years to the west—another (and this was backed by a written argument from the old Alphonsian tables from Spain) that the stars moved constantly in one direction without change.

Passing this group they came to a dwelling the front of which was stone. The door was set back from the street and flanked by short projecting buttresses on either side, put there as if to caution the emerging inhabitant to look carefully to right and left before proceeding—a caution not unwise at night. The windows above were not only crossed by wooden shutters that opened and closed like doors, but also barred with iron. The man in black took from the folds of his gown a huge brass key, which he fitted into the outside door, turned it in the lock with some labor, and then threw the portal open.

They stepped over a small board which served as a threshold, and passed through a dark passageway which led to an open court. At the end of the court was the flat wall of a monastery, without windows or doors. On the right was a low, one-story building, and on the left rose a ramshackle structure of wood, four stories high. Outside this building, leading to the apartments on the second and third floors, was a wooden staircase hitched to the wall by wooden clutch supports and strengthened by a single wooden upright. In the middle of the court was an old well with a bucket on a rope attached to a wheel.

The staircase creaked as they ascended, and seemed to Joseph to swing just a little. It gave him such a dizzy sensation that he clutched at the wall, fearful lest the whole structure should becomeloose and topple down. But the man only smiled as he saw the boy's sudden movement and assured him that the staircase was safe enough. They went up one flight, past the first landing, and then on to the second. Here they stopped and the man reached into his gown for another key, a smaller one this time.

Just as they were entering the apartment on the third floor opposite this landing, Joseph noticed that there was still one more floor above them, even though the main staircase ended with the third floor. The entrance to this top door, which appeared to have been at one time a loft or storeroom, was gained by climbing a crude ladder like staircase with a single rail, which was fastened at a slight angle against the wall. The door to which these steps led was directly above the farther end of the landing, and to Joseph's surprise, appeared to be of metal. From its shape and size the boy decided that it was a window that had been changed into an entrance, while at its right a square aperture had been cut in the wall, probably for the purpose of giving light. In an instant they were in the apartment where the man and girl lived, and Joseph had no further chance to study the loft which in some unexplainable manner had aroused his curiosity.

This apartment was stuffy and poorly lighted, but the furnishings were not poor. There were tapestries and great oaken chairs, a heavy table in the middle of the room, several huge chests, and a sideboard upon which some silver glistened.

The girl ran quickly to a shutter and threw it open, where-upon the light streamed in through a myriad of small glass panes set in lead. Quickly she set before Joseph and the man in black, small goblets which she filled with wine; a few pieces of broken breadwere placed before them on the table, and they all ate, Joseph rather voraciously, although striving to disguise his hunger.

"Now tell us your story," the man bade him.

Joseph related it briefly, emphasizing for the most part the arrival of his father and mother and himself in the city that morning, and the dilemma that faced them in procuring lodgings.

The man in the black robe listened attentively, and when the boy had finished he struck the table a light blow. "I think I have it," he said. "Wait here for me and take what refreshment you will. I will be back in a few moments." He went out through the door and hurried down the stairs to one of the apartments below.

The girl pushed her chair closer to Joseph's and looked up into his eyes.

"What is your name?" she asked.

"I am Joseph Charnetski."

"Joseph," she said. "I like the name much. Mine is Elzbietka."

"My father is Andrew Charletski," continued Joseph, "and we lived in the country of the black lands in the Ukraine. It was lonely in our neighborhood, for the nearest neighbor was sixty staja away, yet we never felt fear of Cossack or Tartar, though others did, for my father always treated them well. We were therefore surprised not long ago when there came to us a former servant, a friendly Tartar, who said that we were in some danger, and although my father laughed, I know that he gave the report some credence, since he took the Tartar aside and talked with him privately for a long time. He is not one to reveal his fear, however, and we remained in our house as before, with the warning all but forgotten by my mother and me.

"Then one night before we went to bed, my mother, who wasworking upon some sewing, saw a man's face peeping in through the thatch at one corner of our house. It was a face that she had never seen before; it was not one of the servants of our place or any place next to ours; it was a villainous face and it made such an impression on her that she screamed aloud, alarming us all."

"Yes?" the blue eyes were full of interest.

"That night my father came into the room where I was sleeping, bade me dress quickly, and in a short time led me and my mother through a little door in the rear of the house that I had never seen opened before, since it had always been fastened with nails. Outside this door we found ourselves in a passageway dug out of the earth like a cave, and through this we crept until we emerged into a shed some distance from the other dwellings where two of our best horses were hitched to a cart. That my father had already taken such precautions unknown to us assured me that he had feared something, the nature of which he had kept from us."

"But you know now?"

"Nay-the most curious part is yet to come. My mother and I climbed into the wagon, where a goodly supply of food had been stored, while my father, moving swiftly, wielded a forked stick with such effect, in one corner of the shed, that he soon unearthed a pile of vegetables which had been covered over with tree branches and leaves in order to preserve them. I thought at the time that he was about to put some of them into our wagon for food, but to my surprise he chose only one."

"And that—"

"A pumpkin."

"A pumpkin! But why—"

"I know no more about it than you. When everything else in our wagon had been eaten, Father refused to give it up—this was ten days later, of course, when we were on the last stages of our journey; and once, indeed this very morning, a man who had evidently pursued us from the Ukraine offered my father the pumpkin's weight in gold in exchange for it—but my father refused."

"Did you learn whose face your mother saw in the thatch?"

"That I did not, but what came later proved that my father had acted wisely in leaving our house secretly and in a hurry. For when we stopped in a village a few days later to rest our horses, we saw a neighbor who had traveled from our part of the country on horseback. He had passed our place on the day after we left. Every building had been burned to the ground, he told us, and the land itself looked as if a battle had raged there; the wheat was down and the crops were burned, and holes had been dug everywhere, as if the invaders had hunted for hidden treasure."

"Your father has the pumpkin now?"

"It is safe in his possession—though why he refused its weight in gold I cannot see. But I think he would not be pleased that I have told all this about it, although I know that the secret is safe with you. Now tell me something of yourself. This man whom you called uncle—is he your father's brother?"

"That he is. My mother and father died in the plague that spread through the town when I was small. He is a master of arts in the university and a very great scholar," she added proudly. "His name is Nicholas Kreutz, and among those most famed in the university in alchemy he is indeed the greatest. He is not a servant of the Church, though a good Christian, and he seeks, as do many others, the secretsof his craft."

The scholar-alchemist appeared suddenly in the doorway and smiled at them.

"I have just ascertained," he said, seating himself at the table, "that if it pleases your father, there is a haven for you all here in this very house. There is not much to pay, and a shelter, however lowly, is better than the sky when light falls. Your father might sell his pair of horses—horses bring a good price at present, I hear—and he could live here until some suitable employment appears. Unless," he added, "the place is too humble—"

"Indeed that cannot be," said the boy eagerly. "Gladly at this minute will he welcome ally roof for the sake of my mother, who is somewhat tired after the long journey from the Ukraine. I cannot go too swiftly to tell him of this news. But only assure me that you are in sober earnest about this matter."

Elzbietka sprang up from her chair. "Did you but know him as well as I, you would not doubt."

At that the alchemist enveloped her with his long arms, from which hung the black sleeves of his gown, until she smiled out from the embrace at Joseph like one caught between the wings of a great raven or crow.

"Hurry and tell your people," she commanded him, "and bring them back here. Indeed, I never knew what a mother was. If I but please her—"

"That you will," shouted Joseph. "I will go as soon as Pan Kreutz unlocks the door for me below."

"Tell your people that it is the door beneath us that is unoccupied," directed the alchemist as he let the boy out through thegate. "There are only two rooms there, a large and a small one, but they will serve your purposes for the time, I believe."

Joseph thanked him with all his heart and set out on the run for the market place. The Street of the Pigeons seemed to unwind before him as he ran, and he was soon in the street leading directly to the Cloth Hall.

Turning there, past one corner of the Town Hall, he ran directly by the cloth markets and headed for the little church near which his father had unloosed the horses. But no sooner had his eyes fallen upon the wagon and his father and mother standing in it, than he stopped suddenly in astonishment. Then, like an arrow leaving a bow, he darted forward, for what he saw set his heart beating faster than it had beaten in all that eventful day.

The stranger that they had left in the mud by the roadside that morning stood by the side of the wagon with a crowd of ruffians at his heels, threatening and shouting at Pan Andrew and his wife. The stranger carried a huge club, and the ruffians, of whom he appeared to be the leader, were armed with staves and stones and were shouting angrily, as if intent on harming the man and woman above them. Pan Andrew, in facing them, had stepped in front of his wife, to shield her if stones were thrown; and the sight of the resistance, and the cries of the leader and his attackers, soon brought a huge crowd surging about the wagon, for it was now close on to noon, and the morning's business of the market was well-nigh finished and many citizens and farmers were eating or resting in the shade of the trees about the square.

Joseph darted through the crowd and leaped up on the wagon, to stand by his father's side.

"Ha, we have the cub as well," shouted the one who had boasted of the name Ostrovski in the early morning. "He is a wizard like unto the father, and a witch like the mother, for it was he who made my horse fly straight up to heaven this morning with a blow upon the flank."

At that, a great skulk in the crowd let fly a stone at the three, which missed Pan Andrew but narrowly.

"Magicians, wizards, witches," hooted the crowd.

"It is the man who is the worst," shouted the self-named Ostrovski. "It is he who hath bewitched my brother and cut off his head and changed the head into a pumpkin. If he be honest, let him deliver that pumpkin over to me in the sight of all, that I may give Christian burial to my brother's brains.... An' he will not, let him face my charge. He is a wizard, yea, and one condemned by Church and court and precept. At him! Kill him! But save me the pumpkin which is the head of my brother!"

Absurd as these accusations seem today, they did not seem so in the fifteenth century. For men were then but beginning to see the folly of many superstitions and cruelties that had been prevalent since the Dark Ages; they believed that certain persons had malign powers such as could transform others into strange animals; they thought that by magic, men could work out their spite upon others in horribly malicious ways; that food could be poisoned by charms and milk made sour.

And to raise the cry of wizard against a man, no matter how peace-loving and innocent he might be, was enough to start rough and brutal men, yes, and women, too, into active persecution and unlawful deeds.

This was the method that the stranger had adopted in order to get his revenge upon Pan Andrew, and not only revenge, but that which he sought even more keenly, the possession of the pumpkin that the country gentleman had refused to deliver to him early in the day. He had been about the city seeking out certain friends or followers in order to raise the cry of wizard, and then he had with them searched through the city until they came upon Pan Andrew and his wife.

"The pumpkin, the pumpkin—it is my brother's head," he kept shouting.

Pan Andrew, on his side, only smiled back derisively upon him, and gathered in the pumpkin where no man could seize it without taking as well a blow from his heavy sword, and the attackers, being more cowards than men, made no attempt to approach the wagon at the side that he was facing. Some, armed with large stones, were, however, sneaking around to get behind him, and others in front were preparing to send a volley of missiles upon him, when there rushed into the turmoil a man of venerable appearance, clad in a brown robe with large puffy sleeves and pointed hood. He was of moderate stature, firm of gait, and bore himself like a man in the prime of life.

A priest he might have been, a brother of some order he seemed, but a scholar he was certainly, for there was that in his face and a droop to the shoulders that proclaimed him a man of letters.

"Cease—cease—cowards all!" he shouted in a commanding tone of voice. "What persecution goes on here?"

"The man and the woman and boy are workers in magic, wizards and a witch," said the leader roughly. "Keep your hands off,for we are admonishing them."

"Wizards and witches—fiddlesticks!" shouted the newcomer, pulling himself up in the wagon until he stood beside Pan Andrew. "This is but an excuse for some such deed of violence as this city has seen too much of in the past twelve months. To attack an honest man—for to any but a blind man he appears as honest—a weak woman, and a defenseless boy—Cowards all, I say! Disperse, or I will call the king's guards to disperse you."

"It is Jan Kanty himself," said one of the rioters in a loud whisper that all about him heard. "I'm off, for one." And throwing his stick to the ground, he took to his heels.

If there had been no magic in Pan Andrew, his wife, or his boy, there was magic in the name of Jan Kanty, and a very healthy magic, too, for at once every hat in that crowd came off, and men began to look askance at each other as if caught in some shameful thing.

"The good Jan Kanty," was whispered on every side, and in the briefest second imaginable the crowd had melted until there remained not one person, not even the leader of the ruffians who had begun the attack.





IV. THE GOOD JAN KANTY


Among the most remarkable personages of Krakow's age of glory in the fifteenth century was a certain scholar-priest by the name of Jan Kanty. He had been educated at the University of Krakow in the period of late Scholasticism when the chief teachings were still mere expositions of the seven arts, of which grammar was the king. However, a full life and much contact with men had made Jan Kanty a well-rounded man. He loved learning for its own sake, but he honored most of all its precepts and its application to life, and he gave himself over in his cell-like quarters on the lower floor of the old university building (now long since destroyed by fire), to the creation of new points of view on old subjects, to comments on the conduct and opinions of the masters and doctors of the university at the great church councils of Europe, and to an intellectual chronicle of his age.

His life was saintly and his cell was as much visited, perhaps, as is his shrine in the magnificent old university library today. The peasants loved him especially, and this was rather curious since the men from the farms rarely sought the advice of the men of the university; they were, in fact, somewhat shy of the dispensers of higher learning. They were not shy of Jan Kanty, however. They came to Krakow to ask his opinion on the weather in the seasons of grains and vegetables, they called upon him for decisions in disputesbetween landowners, they consulted him concerning the proper kind of food for their livestock, they questioned him on all problems having to do with morals or religion, and they accepted his rulings with as much finality and satisfaction as if they had been the rulings of Heaven.

Therefore his name was one to be reckoned with everywhere, inside the city and out. He hated above all things cruelty of man against man, or of man against something helpless, a horse, or a dog, or a child. And when he saw one man and a woman and a boy of honest features and good appearance harassed by some hundred men, he did not hesitate but rushed into the midst of the flying stones without regard to his own safety or comfort.

"Peace be with you," he said to Pan Andrew when the crowd had scattered, "and with you, my daughter," putting his hand upon the woman's head. "What may be the cause of such mischance? You are strangers here?"

"Strangers and worse. Homeless," said Pan Andrew.

"You are come from a long distance?"

"The Ukraine."

The kind shoulders rocked in agitation. "My—my—but surely you have friends in town?"

"I have none. I had a friend here and sought him, but he is dead. My house is burned by Tartars, my wealth is gone. I am pursued by men who seek my life and the one possession that I have left." Here he touched the pumpkin with his foot.

"But why this accusation of magic?"

Pan Andrew smiled. "A trick it was to raise feelings against me in the public square and then to despoil me of this possession. Ithink that he who raised the storm against me here has followed me many miles across the border, and I believe that he is the agent of some more powerful person. There is much to this, my good—my good—You are a priest?"

"Men call me so. I am but a servant of the Father of us all."

"Then, good father, hear me! I seek to do no man wrong. I am helpless in a world of plotting and troubles, and I seek only a place where I may this night provide shelter for my good wife and my boy."

"Come with me then," said the scholar-priest. "I will at least offer you the hospitality that my cell affords.... Nay—hitch your horses to the wagon and drive through that lane yonder which leads to the Street of St. Ann."

Pan Andrew was already adjusting the harness when Joseph tugged at his sleeve. "Father," he urged, "Father, I know of a place where we can stay."

The father looked down at him in astonishment. "You," he answered, "you? And how did you find such a place?"

"A scholar and his niece live there. They took me to their house. There is a space below them at the head of a flight of stairs."

Jan Kanty interposed. "Come at any rate to my dwelling, and there we can make plans. If the boy has found a place, and his face and words seem truthful, then we can talk at better length there at our ease than here in the busy square."

A few minutes later they stopped in front of the largest of a number of buildings, which made up the university. On the way there Joseph had noted that almost every man they passed on the street had doffed his hat to Jan Kanty, and once a whole company ofknights had saluted him with drawn swords. He seemed to pay but little attention to these courtesies, however, for his mind was busy with the problem of the present, and when he alighted from the cart and led the three to his little cell on the ground floor just at the right of the door, he was still pondering.

Once inside the house, however, Pan Andrew, disregarding Joseph's information for the minute, begged an immediate audience with Jan Kanty alone, and while the boy and his mother were eating some food which the scholar had placed upon a table in the corridor just outside his cell, he began to address his host in a low tone.

Their voices buzzed as Joseph and his mother ate. Only once did the boy catch distinct syllables, and that was when the priest asked Pan Andrew, "That, then, is the pumpkin that you have brought from the Ukraine?"

Pan Andrew must have nodded, for be made no verbal answer. He had not dropped the precious vegetable from his hands during the entire conversation. Joseph heard no more of the talk, for he began at that moment to tell his mother of his own adventures of the morning.

As he progressed with his story she ceased eating and stared at him. "Why, this is a very miracle," she said. "As soon as Pan Andrew has finished with the good father in the next room, we will go straight about procuring the lodging of which the scholar told you.... And the poor child—she lost her father and mother in the plague? Indeed, I think that God must have sent us to her."

Jan Kanty at the farther end of the cell listened to Pan Andrew's tale to the very end. He asked a few questions, which the other answered, and then the two began to converse rapidly though in lowtones.

At length Jan Kanty passed his hand across his eyes as if thinking very deeply. Then he said, "It seems to me that there is one course open to you. You have enemies in the city, you believe, and therefore you must remain for the present unseen. I advise a change of name, for such subterfuge is no sin where the end to be gained is righteous. For your present needs you can obtain money by selling your horses and cart; if you wish, I will send a man with them to the horse market in the plain below the Wawel. They would be but an encumbrance to you at best, and moreover they will bring a pretty price since they are of good stock and well fed."

"This money will not last me forever," said Pan Andrew. "I must think of some employment besides."

"I have thought of that," continued Jan Kanty. "I know of employment which might suit your case even though it be a humble task."

"It cannot be too humble for me," answered the other quickly, "provided it brings enough return for the support of my wife and boy."

"Good! Excellent!" exclaimed the scholar. "Then I have just the thing. You were a hunter in the old days, I presume?"

"Why, yes," said Pan Andrew, wondering.

"And you can sound the horn?"

"That I can. And if I do say it, with more skill than any hunter in the Eastern Marches."

"Good! ... But yet one thing. This news which you have imparted to me should be for the ears of the king alone. The treasure which you guard should be returned to him; it should become theproperty of the commonwealth. I know not what harm it has already done in the world; I only hope that it may do-no more. Would you leave it with me for safekeeping, perhaps?"

"Would that I could. But it was the oath that I took to my father that it should never leave my hands while life remained—save to one person, and that person the king of Poland."

"Then God be with you. Rest here until the horses are sold and then after hearing your son's story we will think of tomorrow."

He called the mother and boy into his cell. "Why, here," he said on hearing the story of Joseph's adventure from his mother's lips, "is the thing arranged to perfection. I know the place you mention and I know the scholar Kreutz as well. A curious man, and of certain strange disposition, but honest and sincere and a seeker after light. He is, I think, feared by the common people, as are also many dwellers in the next street, which has been since olden times inhabited by sorcerers and their ilk, and the court of his house is but little frequented. They tell strange tales of him, sometimes, most of which I know to be false. But it is just the place for your dwelling at present, since there is little likelihood of your being disturbed there."

At this so great a feeling of thankfulness came upon Joseph's mother that she would have fallen to her knees and asked the good father for his blessing, but he restrained her.

"Nay, daughter," he said, "it is I who need thy blessing, since I know what fortitude and courage thy kind heart possesses."

She kissed his hand nevertheless, as did Joseph immediately afterward, and Pan Andrew turned away quickly lest they should see that his eyes were moist, for there is such power in kindness well bestowed that it touches the wells of human feeling. There was, too,something in this scholar-priest that went at once to the heart, some fine quality of feeling and spirituality that set him apart, though ever so sweetly and gently, from other men.

A servant of the university was dispatched to sell the horses and cart, and Joseph with his father and mother sat down to await the man's return.

While they were waiting, there came a knocking upon the outside door. Jan Kanty went to it at once. A woman stood there, with a baby in her arms, not in the attitude of one asking for alms but of one seeking advice. She came, it seemed, from the Black Village and was suffering much from pains that took her legs and arms and neck.

Jan Kanty questioned her quietly. "Where do you sleep?" he asked.

"On the floor, reverend sir," she answered. "And the aches and pains are so strong that I can stand them no longer. It is certain that a devil possesses me, and I would that you should pray him away."

"Is the door made of stones?"

"It is."

"Are the stones ever wet?"

"No, reverend sir, except in spring."

"Is the earth damp beneath the stones?"

"Why—yes—perhaps," she said. "Sometimes when the well water is not much used it overflows, for there is a source there, and sometimes when they have been drawing water carelessly the overflow leaks down beneath the stones."

"Then take heed to what I say and the aches and pains will pass. Take stones and build a low wall between the well and the side ofyour cottage. Make this waterproof and then dig a drain that will carry the water away from your house. Hang your bedclothes often in the sun and be sure that they are always dry. Change every week the boughs upon which you lie; thus will the pains go away."

She kissed his hand and departed.

Then came a peasant who complained that worms were coming up from the ground and were destroying the young shoots of his plants.

"Could you but say a prayer, father," the man supplicated, "the worms will cease."

"It is for you to prevent them," said Jan Kanty. "Sprinkle all the earth about the plants with ashes which you take from your stove. If this does not prevent the worms, then rise early in the morning and pour water about the plants. The worms will then come to the top where the water is, and you may kill them."

Then stooping over a high desk he began to write upon a long scroll of parchment, the end of which hung far over the desk almost to the floor. He used for writing the quill of a pigeon thrust into a piece of oak wood.

Joseph curled up on a bench that ran along beneath the windows and closed his eyes. What a day it had been! And what might the future hold?

His thoughts, which at first had begun to run slowly, suddenly became brisk and grew fantastic. He seemed to see himself bearing armor, a shield, and a sword, fighting desperately with a great dark-browed Tartar who had instead of a head a huge yellow pumpkin. Then the Tartar suddenly took off his head, and carrying it in his arms, climbed up a steep ladder to a room that seemed to hang fromthe stars. Out of it came lightning and flashes of strangely colored light, and suddenly the Tartar emerged, now with the head of a dog, and the pumpkin floating along beside him as if it were but a ball of feathers in the wind. The scratching of Jan Kanty's quill grew fainter and fainter, and the fantastic world dimmed slowly in blackness.

Joseph was fast asleep.

When he awoke the room was no longer filled with sunshine. A single candle lantern was burning at the farther end of the cell, and by its light he could see his father, Jan Kanty, and his mother busied with something that lay in front of them upon the table. He rubbed his eyes to make sure that he was awake—yes, it was the mysterious pumpkin, from which his father was slicing away the outer rind with a huge knife. It was a curious pumpkin, that vegetable—the rind was so hard and brittle that the knife scraped on it as if it were cutting or whittling away a piece of board. Joseph, fascinated, watched the process, almost afraid to breathe. Little by little the hard pieces dropped to the floor like bits of shell as the blade cut them through.

"I think," the father was saying in a low voice, "that I hold here in my hand the reason for the attack on my house in the Ukraine, and that the man who has hounded us today knew very well what this pumpkin shell contained. He had been told that I had it in my possession; he knew the exact size of my property, and he quickly put two and two together when he saw this pumpkin, and only this pumpkin, in my wagon. The reason that I made no effort to conceal it was, of course, to allay any suspicion concerning it."

"But," interrupted Jan Kanty, "a pumpkin at this time of year is likely to create some curiosity among those who give the matter a second thought. This is a late pumpkin, and I suppose that in allPoland it would be hard to find another such in midsummer."

"True," replied Pan Andrew, "but I had to risk that. Long ago when I was worried over this sacred charge and feared lest some enemy might discover its existence and attempt to rob me, there came to me the idea of a shell like this as an excellent means of concealment. Since that day there has never been a time, summer or winter, when there was not a pumpkin shell in readiness for an emergency, and many an experiment was I obliged to make, indeed, before I was able to preserve a shell in the good condition of this one."

At this moment he cut away the last piece of the rind.

The room was suddenly filled with the light of a thousand candles. Colors of the rainbow fell upon the walls—a huge center of radiance like the sun in the heavens blazed into being at the very place where the pumpkin shell had been but a moment before. Flickering, dancing flecks of light leaped about the room and transformed its gloom into the brilliancy of day—and then there was again but the light of the little lantern, for the father had placed that which the pumpkin contained in a bag furnished by Jan Kanty, and was busy tying up the open side when Joseph came rushing up to the table.

"Father," he cried, "what was it? What was the light which came from that which you took from the pumpkin?"

The father's voice was kindly but firm. "In time, Joseph, you shall know. It would be but a care to you, a matter of more worry than you suspect, if you knew what responsibility we are carrying here. If it is mere curiosity, be assured that knowledge will bring nothing but pain. If it is real interest, I will tell you plainly that indue time you shall be informed of all that has passed. Just now—it has cost me so much that I have not the heart to burden your young life with its secrets."

He broke off, and after a short silence, changed the subject.

"We will go now to that place which you have found for us. While you slept the reverend father and I have been to see your friends. He has seen to it that the rooms have been made comfortable, and there we shall stay, at least for the present."





V. IN THE STREET OF THE PIGEONS


St. Ann's Street was as black as pitch when they emerged from the habitation of the scholar-priest. He insisted on accompanying them and carried his little candle lantern for aid, which, though it threw a faint light upon the ground a step or two ahead, yet had not much more light than the stars which shone down from a moonless sky. Pan Andrew, with his wife on his right arm, followed Jan Kanty, and Joseph brought up the rear. They had taken but a few steps along the narrow footwalk by the side of the road when something damp and clammy was forced into the boy's right hand; he gave a little startled jump, but reassured himself at the next minute that it was nothing but the nose of a stray dog that had sought his hand as a token of friendly greeting.

And as I live, thought Joseph as he reached down and felt a great shaggy head, it's like the wolf dog that leaped at Elzbietka this very day. Yes—it's about the same size—and here: the collar is exactly the same that I had my fingers through. I know its feel by those little knobs that almost tear the flesh.

"Father! Father!" he called.

Pan Andrew turned about quickly. "What is it?"

"A dog," answered the boy, "a friendly dog."

"Bring him along with us," said the father with a laugh, "we can't have too many friends just now." And at that they continued ontheir way.

Now of all the creatures that God has put in the world a dog is the most curious, and sometimes, one might think, the most discerning. For when this same animal had broken loose in the morning, his first impulse, which he had followed, had been that of flight. His second impulse was to look for a friend, since no dog can live without a friend. The Tartar boy had already departed. The dog had seen too much of him as it was. Also by virtue of a rare instinct which dogs, and sometimes horses, possess, the wolf dog had realized fully that the boy who had leaped at his collar was not an enemy. Perhaps it was the boy's touch, perhaps it was some quality in the tone of his voice, but the animal knew that Joseph was used to dogs and knew as well that he was just in his treatment of them. Therefore he had searched all day throughout the city streets, and when he came upon this little group of people in the dark street his sense of smell told him that here was a dog lover, and marvel of marvels, it was the same dog lover that had sprung upon him earlier in the day!

They turned at length from St. Ann's Street into a side lane that is known today as Jagiellonska, and followed it for a short distance until they reached the Street of the Pigeons. Here they turned to the left and walked for a few steps until suddenly just before them rose a babel of subdued voices. Father Jan Kanty stood stock-still. The others also came to a halt and remained motionless, except for the dog, which strained at Joseph's hold upon his collar.

"Stay," said the scholar, "I will go forward to see what may be in the air." And holding his lantern at the height of his head, he plunged into a crowd of black-robed figures that had formed a circlein the very middle of the street.

"Students," he cried aloud, as he swung his lantern first to this face and then to that, "students. And what devilment make you here now?"

The crowd broke before him at a touch. Either he was much feared by them or greatly respected—that Pan Andrew could see— perhaps both.

"A duel," he exclaimed as he reached the center of the crowd, where a space lighted by a lantern upon the ground had previously been obscured by the bodies of the lookers-on, "and what means it?"

Two young men, both students, with their black university robes lying beside them on the ground, stood facing each other with unfastened under jackets. Slender Italian dueling swords, or foils, held firmly in the clasped fingers of their bared right arms, had clashed the instant before Jan Kanty entered the arena.

"A duel," he repeated. "Do you not know that dueling has been forbidden I know not how many times within these streets bounding the university? Do you not know that it is punishable by fine or imprisonment even, if the duelers are students?"

His hands groped fearlessly for the weapons. "This is no play duel," he cried, as he gathered them in.

Indeed it was not! The young men were fighting with naked rapiers! In most of the students' duels the points of the weapons were capped with buttons to make them less dangerous, or if the engagements were to be with broad-swords, the opponents wore breastplates and heavy gauntlets and helmets. But here stood two young men without a single precaution against injury, and it was quite evident that one of them would have been badly wounded hadnot the scholar brought the fight to an end.

"What means this?" he repeated. "Who may you be?" Holding the lantern close up to the face of the nearer, he cried out suddenly in astonishment. "Johann Tring! As much would I have thought of seeing you here as I would have of seeing our own lord cardinal. You whom I thought more a slave to a crucible than to a sword. And your name?" he thundered at the other.

"Conrad Mlynarki of Mazovia," answered the student, thrusting his weapon back into his girdle and letting his eyes drop for shame.

"A Mazovian! Well, it rejoices me that you are ashamed, and there was perhaps reason for your anger, since I hear that Mazovians are insulted without much thought these days. Go to your room! I will hear your story tomorrow. And you"—he turned to the remnants of the original crowd, those few who remained, maliciously hoping to see punishment meted out to the offenders—"betake yourselves to your bursars with all possible speed, for if I see one of you here when I return, I will notify the authorities in the morning."

"As to you, Johann Tring," he addressed the other student when he stood alone with him in the middle of the street, "are you not ashamed at such a public brawl?"

"I am not," said the student quickly and without flinching at the look which Jan Kanty gave him.

At this moment Pan Andrew and the others came up to them. In the light of the lantern Joseph glanced at the face of the student, Johann Tring, and received almost a shock—a feeling at least of violent repulsion. It was not that the face was distorted, indeed it was not, the eyes were bright and piercing, and the hair was black—the carriage of the body was erect, and the whiteness of theskin where the collar was rolled back stood in remarkable contrast to the hair and the blackness that lay about him. But the nose was thin and mean, the mouth was small and smug, and out of the eyes came a look that signified an utterly selfish spirit behind them. For one so young this expression was strange, and even more than strange; it was unnatural, and this unnaturalness was more apparent, even, to a boy of Joseph's age than it might have been to an older and maturer man who was used to much selfishness and meanness in the world.

"Now what caused this quarrel?" Joseph heard the scholar ask the question rather sharply.

"It is too long to tell at once—"

"Yes, but briefly."

"He insulted me."

"What did he say?"

"More things than one, but chiefly chided me about my studies. Asked me if I had learned yet how to make gold out of iron or brass or leather and said that he would collect old shoes all over the city if I would transmute them into precious metal."

"And this upon no provocation?"

The young man hesitated, yet there was something compelling about Jan Kanty that caused men to speak the truth to him. "I did ask him if the frogs in the north country spoke Mazovian," he answered in a rather sour voice.

"Yes, and I thought it was something like this," spoke Jan Kanty quickly. "Why must one always aggravate these Mazovians to their swords? I warn you here and now that, swordsman though you may be, the Mazovians are much more nimble with blades than with tongue."

"But he said further," went on Tring in self-justification, and being unable to express himself clearly in Polish, continued in German, much to Joseph's distress, for he could not understand a word.

"Have more caution, Tring," said the scholar at length. "Since you are not enrolled as a regular student of the university you must be even more careful in your conduct than if you were.... Since it is you who have first drawn your weapon, it must be you who make peace. Go tomorrow at dawn and kiss your opponent upon the cheek and sue him for pardon."

This advice sat hard upon Tring's temper, but he was so much influenced by the scholar that he finally bowed his head in consent.

"And further than this I might say, Johann Tring, that such occurrences bring you no credit. I know not much of your studies these days, though I think sometimes that you keep company more with necromancers and astrologers of little merit than with such worthy men as Pan Kreutz and his equals. These are dark days when men look with suspicion upon all who engage in investigation whether it be honest or dishonorable, godly or selfish. Are you still at Kreutz's?"

"I am."

"Then come with us, since we are bound for his dwelling. This Pan and his wife are taking the rooms below Kreutz's."

The young man tried to peer into the darkness beyond the lantern light to see who the new tenants might be, but none of the Charnetskis was visible.

They walked ahead a few steps until they came to the door where Joseph had been in the afternoon. Jan Kanty reached up andpulled the wire, which hung down from above the door, and in a few minutes an old bent woman with a lantern scrutinized their faces from the open doorway and admitted them.

"All will be well now," said Joseph's father. "We need not trouble you further."

"It has been otherwise than trouble," protested the scholar. "You will be well and comfortable, I am sure, for all the arrangements have been made. Tomorrow I shall send you the man who will tell you of your new duties. And now good night to you, Pan Andrew— Kovalski"—he hesitated a bit over the assumed name—"and may peace be with you."

"And with you." They all repeated it.

The kindly figure of the gentle, loving, saintly old man passed out into the darkness again. The woman slammed the door and bolted it heavily when the Charnetskis—now the Kovalskis—Johann Tring, and the dog were inside.

"At last," said Pan Andrew, "we are at home."

They passed through the passage with its pointed arches and emerged into the court, the woman leading the way with her lantern. Here Tring bade them good night and went to his room on the right-hand side of the court. Joseph felt at parting from him something of the same dislike that he had experienced when the lantern light had fallen upon his face in the street; the face was one that might easily come to haunt a man in his dreams, and yet it was in daylight but an ordinary face, like that of a thousand other students who possessed neither the gift of beauty nor the curse of ugliness—yet in that yellow gleam of the lantern there had been upon the features some indefinable threat of malignity.

The woman led them to the stairway on the left. As they ascended these same stairs that Joseph had climbed earlier in the day, the whole staircase seemed even more shaky and rickety than it had appeared in the light of day. The woman moved ahead of them freely, but Pan Andrew and his wife and Joseph clung to the railing as if for protection in case the boards should fall away beneath their feet.

At the first landing the door stood open. Out from this door came the welcome beam of a candle, lighted by the hands of Elzbietka Kreutz. The father with this candle in his hand at once inspected the little quarters. There were but two rooms, one of them fortunately large and of good shape, so that while one end of it must serve as a bedroom for Pan Andrew and his wife, there was ample room at the other end for the general living quarters of the family. The smaller room at the back Joseph would sleep in. The woman who had opened the door had been busy all the evening preparing the place for occupancy, expending some of the money which Pan Andrew had given her for bare necessities, a rug, wooden eating utensils, chairs, and beds.

He had left his name as Andrew Kovalski with the woman, the name which had been agreed upon with Jan Kanty, a name in itself one of the most common, since it signified a smith—and the alchemist and his niece having been advised of the kinship with the Tenczynskis, willingly pledged silence concerning the true name.

"Well, wife," said Pan Andrew when they were alone and the door fastened, "this is better than we dared hope." There upon he laid down upon the table in the large room the precious round parcel which had not left his hands at any time since they had set out fromJan Kanty's cell. "Best of all we are safe here; the door is heavy, the front of the building is of stone, and from the rear no one could climb over the wall without danger to himself. It is, indeed, the wall of a monastery to which none but monks have access. Above us is the alchemist Kreutz, and below on the ground floor are the old woman and her son, both of whom take care of the building and watch the gate at night. Across the way live a few students; one of them this Johann Tring who accompanied us. Those seeking us would never think of looking for us here; the change in name is also a protection. Here we may stay in comfort until such time as we may communicate with the king."

He intended to say more, but was interrupted by a curious sound that came from outside, as if a heavy body were dragging itself along. The mother uttered a little cry of fear; Pan Andrew reached for the handle of his short sword, but Joseph broke into a laugh.

"It is my dog rubbing against the door," he said. "He is tired and hungry, and no doubt wants a little water. There is a well in the court below from which I will draw it, and he can sleep then in the shelter of the wail. Tomorrow I must procure a chain or rope to fasten him with, for he is nearly wild and might cause trouble if he ran about." With this, Joseph searched in a basket for a bit of meat and a piece of bread, and finding them, descended to the court below. It was dark there but his mother held the lantern above him so that he could see to draw water and settle the dog in a corner of the wall.

When they returned his father was preparing for bed. The valuable package had been disposed of somewhere; with curious eyes Joseph scanned every inch of the large room and came to the conclusion that the only hiding place in the quarters was thatafforded by the bed, either in the shadowy place beneath it, or somewhere in the bedding or folded clothes beneath the headrest.

He ceased to wonder very long about it, however, for his eyelids were heavy, despite his sleep of the afternoon. The whole world drifted off into oblivion, it seemed, the minute that he laid his head on the stuffed bag that served for a pillow.

The next day all were astir early. The mother was at work polishing the woodwork, and the father was driving nails to strengthen the cheap chairs, or covering cracks in the wall, and later inspecting the old staircase outside the building to see if he might mend it. The daylight inspection brought with it some satisfaction, for while it confirmed his belief that the staircase was shaky, yet it revealed that the underpinnings were firmer than might be supposed. The staircase might last for some years if it did not have rough usage, and certainly there was no immediate danger, as Pan Andrew had feared the night before.

Joseph took an early opportunity, after he had eaten the breakfast brought by the old woman who lived below, to run forth into the Street of the Pigeons with the dog, whom he named at once Wolf. In the daytime the street wore little of the sinister aspect that it carried at night; the little oval windows that had seemed then like wicked eyes peering down, now were more like the eyes of merry gnomes or pixies. The buildings which in the twilight, or even in the nighttime when lights fell upon them, seemed grotesque or terrible, in the light of day seemed only curiously twisted out of shape and hung out and bent inward in every conceivable fashion. All the lower windows bore heavy iron bars; doors carried great metal hinges that spread like trees over the surface of the hard wood, andchains dangled and rattled when the house occupants went in or out. From some windows hung clothes—women's clothing, long hose worn by men, jackets, and here and there, a student's black gown. The novelty of the street attracted the boy, and for a long time he wandered through it curiously.

At the upper end, where it met a cross street that ran toward the Rynek, the Street of the Pigeons curved quite sharply. Joseph finally ran with the dog clear to this cross street, which bore the name Bracka, and then, retracing his steps, bore back to the house which had now become his home. Mounting the steps rather breathlessly, he threw open the door to the outer room and was about to shout a merry greeting, as was his usual custom, but checked himself at sight of a stranger who stood talking with his father. The newcomer, who had a pleasant face, was dressed in leathers somewhat like those of the night watch when the outer chain armor is removed. On the table in front of the men lay a long brass trumpet, made cunningly and polished until it resembled gold.

By the side of the trumpet lay two parchment scripts, one of them evidently a copy of a long piece of writing, the other—as Joseph could see—a set of musical notes worked carefully in red and black.

"This," said the stranger, pointing first to the script containing the writing, "is a copy of the oath that you have already sworn. This other is the music of the Heynal, the hymn which you must play from the church tower every hour of the night. The trumpeter whom you relieve tonight will give you the key to the tower room, and what information you may need. It is a noble piece of work, this sounding of the Heynal, and I am much pleased that Father Jan hasbeen able to find so good a Pole as you to carry out the night duties." With this, he kissed Pan Andrew upon the right cheek and departed.

Joseph stared in frank amazement. The Heynal! The church tower. And his father!

"I will tell you everything," said the father as they sat down to the noonday meal. "This oath which I have sworn is the customary oath taken by the watchman-trumpeter of the tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary. You may read it at your leisure. The music is the hymn with the broken note of which I have promised to tell you the story soon. It is played each hour from the windows in the octagon room at the top of the higher tower."

"And you are to be the trumpeter?" asked Joseph.

"I am, thanks to the good Jan Kanty," the father answered. "The trumpeter and the watchman as well, for it is from this tower that fires throughout the city are sighted and the alarm given with the big bell. For the present it must be for our own safety that we are known as the Kovalski family, a name which Father Jan has given us. As plain Andrew Kovalski I shall be a mere city dweller of Krakow. I shall be trumpeter, succeeding the man—God rest his soul!—who died but a week ago, since which time there has been a substitute who can play but badly."

"But the man said each hour of the night," exclaimed the boy. "Will you be there all night?"

"Yes," answered Pan Andrew. "It is for my own safety to be abroad in the city only after nightfall. None will recognize me then—and as for you, my son, the good father has arranged that you shall attend the Collegium Minus here, to complete your studies, which I and your tutors have already begun with you. But there mustbe caution employed even by you, for there are people who seek nothing better than to find us and despoil us of our treasure. You may take your exercises with the other boys very soon, however, and go abroad with discretion, for in the clothes, which I shall buy you there will be no danger, I think, that you may be recognized. A close mouth is necessary nevertheless. Tell no one of our adventures and be content for the time with the plain name Joseph Kovalski."

Thus, at the direction of the good Jan Kanty, Pan Andrew became Pan Kovalski—Joseph was to be sent to school—and the watchtower of the Church of Our Lady Mary was to see a new trumpeter.

At the moment that the father had ceased speaking, there came running into the room from the staircase the girl Elzbietka Kreutz, who made straight for Joseph's mother and was caught into her arms. "We shall be happy here," the woman exclaimed, "that I know, and here is one that needs a mother's love." The girl turned to smile to Pan Andrew, whose face grew gentle at the sight of her eyes, and he picked up her slim, dainty hand and kissed it—it was indeed a picture, that fragile white hand lying in his huge brown palm.

"Uncle has told me," she said, "that you are to play the trumpet at the church. Often at night, when I lie awake lonely and have strange fears, I listen for the music from the steeple. And now when I know that it is Joseph's father that is playing I shall go to sleep again and fear nothing."

"It is as if I had two children," said Pan Andrew, slipping one arm about the child and the other about his son. "It truly seems as if God has once more smiled upon us."





VI. THE TOWER OF THE TRUMPETER


One of the great sights of central Europe, even in those faraway days, which men came from all parts of the world to see, was the Church of Our Lady Mary in Krakow. Now, though this church rose majestically over the medieval city, its towers visible from afar, and its red brick walls as substantial and as solid as the very rock base of the Wawel Hill itself, it was not from the outside such an imposing sight as was its more aristocratic sister, the Wawel Cathedral. It lacked flying buttresses and distinct Gothic ornamentation, such as huge gargoyles and flowers and saints carved in stone, though its graceful form indicated a solid and magnificent strength. It was not a church such as one might gaze upon in sunny France, where the mild breezes and sweet sunshine permit delicate carvings and pinnacles upon the outside walls, but it was built like a solid fortress to withstand the mighty storms that sometimes sweep over Poland from the wild steppes or from the Baltic Sea. It was the interior of this church, however, that drew men to it, for within, it was a very miracle of beauty, a crystal hidden in a shapely stone.

It was to this church, then, that Pan Andrew and Joseph wended their way after darkness fell on their first day in the new dwelling. Pan Andrew carried the trumpet under his right arm. Near the base of the higher tower a watchman spied them as they approached, and unlocked a small, heavy door that led to the tower stairs. They wentup a narrow staircase, winding about in the darkness, until it reached a platform where the interior of the tower loomed suddenly above them. Just at the right, as they began their ascent in the main body of the tower, was a door that led to a little chapel in which, as Joseph learned afterward, prisoners condemned to death spent their last hours on earth.

A man carrying a lantern shouted to them from above; they waited then until he had descended—he was the day watchman whom Pan Andrew relieved. He paused to kiss Pan Andrew upon the cheek in welcome, and to speak a few words in explanation of his duties above. Then he placed in his hand the lantern and a key to the room, which the trumpeter was to occupy in the high tower. He wished them luck on their first night and then descended by the side staircase to the ground, where the watchman let him out. Joseph and his father in the meantime began to climb the steps of the scaffolding that led up into the tower. This scaffolding was held in place by crossbeams, and at its edge ran the steps, so built that as a man ascended he passed constantly from one of the four sides of the tower to another side. The staircase was steep and narrow, but very solid, so solid that the stairs did not creak as they ascended.

They climbed and climbed, past five levels of windows glassed in with small white globes of solid crystal. Up and up went father and son, until they reached the level where there was a room for the watchman. This octagonal room was divided into two sections, one being the room where the trumpeter might keep warm between watches, the other being the open space around it, from which the turret windows looked out over the city. Here hung extra trumpets, here were the ropes, which connected with the great bell hanging inthe lower tower, and here were the red flags and the lanterns, which were hung out when a fire was perceived from the tower.

For it was the duty of the trumpeter to watch constantly for fires. He was to watch also for troops approaching the city, for tumults or disturbances of any kind, but he was especially the guardian against fires. Conflagrations had done the city much harm in the past; many of the older buildings were of wood, although fronted with stone, and roofs were often of thatch or soft wood that easily caught fire from sparks. When a fire was discovered, the trumpeter or watchman, for he was both, hung a red flag from the window which faced the direction in which the blaze lay. At night he would hang out a lantern with a red glass front instead of the flag.

It was his duty also to sound the alarm bell if any danger whatever came to threaten the lives of citizens. In the very month previous to the coming of Pan Andrew and his family to Krakow, the watchman had rung loud and long upon the bell to alarm the watch and the city when the riot against the Tenczynski family took place. In the coming year the bell was to be tolled at the execution, in the Town Square just below the tower, of the four men charged with causing the riot. The tower was indeed the very center of Krakow activity.

Pan Andrew fitted his key to the lock of the door leading into the inner room and threw back the bolt. Entering after his father, Joseph found himself in a small comfortable room containing a table, a bed, a small stove, and a lighted lantern hanging on the wall. About the table were three chairs, wedged rather tightly because of the lack of space, and upon the table was a huge hourglass, one of the largest that Joseph had ever seen. The sand pouring through itin a fine stream had filled the lower section almost to a level graded on the glass with a Latin "X" to designate the tenth hour. The glass was in reality a twelve-hour glass, and lines and Latin numerals had been marked upon it just after the maker had blown it into shape, when the material was still soft. This was the trumpeter's official clock. There was on the south side of the nave roof, where the sun touched at all hours of the day, a large sundial which was read each noon, and on the north wall of the tower was a clock with one hand. This hand, which indicated the hours, was in truth a hand—a piece of metal shaped like a double fist—with fingers curled and the index pointing out to the hours.

When the sand had reached the level of the glass at which the "X" was cut, Pan Andrew hastened out to the open section of the tower and released a coil of rope that hung on a pillar in the center of the space. This rope ran down through a hole in the flooring, until it reached the level of the lower tower, when it swung about over a piece of round wood that served as a pulley

and leaped from there to the lower tower through an aperture that was originally designed as a narrow window through which to shoot arrows in time of defense. In the lower tower the rope was connected with one end of an iron hammer that was suspended above the great bell. When the rope was pulled the hammer descended, but it sprang quickly back to its original position when the rope was loosed, a spring of twisted metal and leather serving to draw it back. Pan Andrew pulled once—the hammer descended—boom—the stroke of the bell sounded over the whole city. He pulled again and again until the full quota of ten strokes was made.

Next he went to the side of the tower nearest the entrance to the little room and swung back a small glass window. Through this space he thrust the trumpet and began to play. It was on the West Side, the side toward the Cloth Hall, with the university in the distance. Then he moved to another window but one and began to play toward the south. Likewise he played toward the east, and finally toward the north, according to the instructions which he had received. Lights were twinkling now all over the city below him; the air was soft and smelled of the freshly cut grass which the peasants gather into piles. In the direction of the university a group of men were chanting a hymn. A clashing of iron hoofs on the stones of Grodzka Street betokened the presence of some armed men, perhaps the servitors of some nobles' houses at the castle, or perhaps members of the royal guard. Men of the night watch could be heard banging at doors of shops with the butts of their spears to be sure that no careless apprentice or servant had left the door ajar. Down below, in the graveyard, the white stones were just perceptible, dim and gray in the dusk; and over the way, the lamplighter was enkindling the huge wicks of the lamps that hung under the Cloth Hall roof. The stars were coming out, one after another, in the sky, where a touch of blue still lingered—across this world rang the notes of the hymn which Pan Andrew had just played exquisitely, the Heynal, or Hymn to the Holy Mother.

"It is wondrous sweet," said Joseph.

"It is so, my son," replied the father. Thereupon he told the boy of the morning, years before, when the square below them had been full of hostile Tartars; of the lad who had kept his oath, even with the last breath of life itself; and of the honor paid him from that day to this by the tower trumpeters who end the Heynal at the broken note.

And Joseph, listening with eyes shining and heart throbbing, realized more at that moment than ever before how dear to him was his native land and all the customs that had been bequeathed by brave men and women who had made it great forever among all nations; it seemed as if tears were forcing themselves to his eyes as he thought of the sacrifice of that young life so many years before, but a thrill of pride drove back the tears when he thought of the nobility of the deed, as he stood silently gazing out of the little tower window.

They re-entered the inner room.

"I have brought you here tonight," Pan Andrew explained when he had closed the door and hung the trumpet on the wall, "in order to instruct you in the duties of the trumpeter of this church. For there might come a time when I should be ill, or perhaps even wounded— who knows, since I have so many enemies? I have taken the oath that I will play this trumpet each hour, and that it is no vain oath you have learned from the story which I have just told you. The trumpet must be played, happen what will. Therefore"—he drew out a piece of parchment and sketched on it with a bit of charcoal a series of lines—"you are to learn by heart the notes which I sketch here."

"Here are the notes of the Heynal," he continued after he had worked silently some minutes upon his composition, "the tune goes like this." He hummed the melody and indicated on the parchment how each symbol represented a note.

"This," he said, "it is necessary to learn. Work upon it during the coming week, and at this time next week be able to write it out. Do not let it interfere with your work at the collegium but glance at it in spare time. Also, if you can, sing to yourself beneathyour breath the melody of the Heynal. When you have learned the melody, I will teach you to play it upon the trumpet. It is not a hard task, although perfection comes only after much effort. I will teach you single tongue and double tongue, and triple tongue, which is the queen of the trumpeter's music, just as grammar is king of the scholastic kingdom."

Joseph slipped the parchment inside his coat.

"And now," directed the father, "go down the stairs quickly and run with dispatch to our house. As you descend leave the lantern against the wall on the lowest tower level; be sure that you extinguish it. The mother is waiting and may be already lonely."

"Nay, I left her with Elzbietka."

"Bless the child. But, just the same, go with all speed, for city streets are dangerous at night. Keep close to the watchmen where possible, and if asked why you are out so late, reply that your father is trumpeter in the tower and that you are returning home with a message from him."

Joseph descended; he left the extinguished lantern at the place where the steps begin to mount the scaffolding and felt his way down the stone steps to the tower door. There he rapped, until the watchman let him out. Once in the street he was off like the wind, until he found himself in the Street of the Pigeons.

Much to his surprise the entrance door was opened, not by the old woman who saw to the care of the building, but by her son, who up to this time had kept himself well out of sight. As the light from the lantern fell upon his face, Joseph drew back in alarm; when his father had mentioned the fact that the old woman was living with her son, Joseph had imagined that the son was a youth, or perhapsa boy—he did not expect to see a man who had the face of one of middle age. Yet the term "man" was less applicable to the son than was the word "creature," for he was lank and thin and bowed over uncannily; long wisps of hair fell about his eyes; his fingers were bony and claw like; his cheeks were sunken, and his eyes peered out of hollow caverns as if they feared the light. As he moved ahead of Joseph, with the lantern in his hand, he clung to the wall as does a cat, shunning open spaces and skulking as if always needing a rear defense.

At the foot of the stairs he stopped.

Joseph was about to pass him and begin the ascent when the creature raised one of his hands and passed it over the boy's shoulder. Joseph heard the long nails scraping on his coat—in a horrible second it seemed as if he could feel them on his skin. The perspiration broke out on his forehead.

"What do you want?"

"A little—little coin," whispered the man.

Joseph handed him a piece of copper gladly.

"Good boy—good boy," the other mumbled, "bless thee, bless thee. And when you have much that jingles remember Stas. Stas I am, and here I sleep." He pointed at the door standing open on the lower floor, but Joseph's eyes did not follow him. His attention was taken suddenly from Stas by a burst of flame that leaped like a live thing from the tiny window of the loft of the alchemist on the fourth floor. It was just a little flare—a small flame that issued through the opened shutter, which the alchemist usually kept closed—it died down in a second or even less, but for that instant it lighted up the whole court and the surrounding buildings.

"Hey," said the man, pointing upward, "there they have magic that takes a soul away from a body.... See"—there was another dash, brighter than the first and longer continued—"there be devils that come to earth with the fire of hell upon them.... Their servant is the alchemist Kreutz, and they have one among us here on earth that is more like them than like us.... You know whom I mean?" He swung the lantern close to Joseph's face, the boy recoiling fearfully. "The student Tring! He it is that would deal with the devil and give him his soul. Have I not heard him at night as he lay awake in his room on the farther side of the court, mumbling and calling and singing? He it is who is the curse of this house....Well, I must sleep. A good night to you." And he went in through the open door.





VII. IN THE ALCHEMIST'S LOFT


Joseph found himself too sleepy when he was inside his tiny bedroom to give any further attention either to the flashes of light from the loft above or to the mysterious grumblings of Stas. And the beginning of his studies at the Collegium Minus on the following day, drove, for the time being, all matters of lesser importance from his mind. There was an evening a week or more later, however, when the incident recurred to him. He had accompanied his father, as was his custom, to the tower, and returning early, had paused for a moment on the landing outside his door before entering the house. The night was fine and he peered contentedly about over the starlit roofs, the red chimneys, and the black walls. Down below him Wolf started uneasily in his sleep, as if he were dreaming of evil things. From the little window of the room beside the door of his own dwelling there was thrown upon the darkness a faint glimmer from a lamp which signified that his mother was sitting up, perhaps with Elzbietka, who had said earlier in the day that she would come down that evening.

He fell to musing in the sweet calm of the night, as young people will do, and in his musing wondered mightily what might be the importance which his father had attached to the treasure which he had brought to Krakow. It might be a gem worth thousands and thousands of gold zloty—it might be merely a fashioned piece ofglass of value only to the tradesmen who worked in glass. But then, why had it made the impression that it had upon Jan Kanty, and why was the bold stranger so eager to gain possession of it? And why in such a peaceful world must names be changed and goings and comings veiled in a mantle of night? Why—

Flash! Into the night suddenly leaped the same brilliance that had startled him on that earlier evening when he had been alone in the court with Stas. Only, immediately following it now, here came a cry of someone in fright or pain.

The door at the landing above him was thrown open and a figure in white emerged. It began to descend the stairs hurriedly, and as it came near, Joseph saw that it was Elzbietka in her night clothes, over which she had thrown a white coverlid from her bed.

He spoke quickly in order that his presence might not alarm her.

"Elzbietka," he said, "it is I, Joseph. What has happened?"

"My uncle," she cried, "Joseph, I know not what they are doing."

"I thought you were with my mother," he exclaimed.

"I was, but I became sleepy, and she told me to go up and sleep. I did sleep, for some time, too. But then this loud talking and noise began. Joseph," she came close up to him, "Joseph, I am frightened. Something is going on upstairs that is not good. The student Tring is with my uncle always now. He came early in the evening, and they have been there together ever since. Uncle never used to go up there at night before—he stayed with me. Joseph, I fear that student Tring."

"I know what you feel," he said.

"I believe that he has some power over people that is not of thisearth," she continued. "You do not know how much my uncle has changed since he first knew him. And I am all alone."

"What did you hear tonight?" asked the boy.

"I was wakened by a loud tramping on the floor. Then my uncle said, 'No, that will kill.' Then the student laughed a terrible laugh. After that there was a long, long silence. I was almost asleep again when I heard another voice—it was like to no one that I had ever heard before. There was something about it that made me think it was my uncle speaking, but it was in such a tone that it made my blood run cold. And now there are those flashes of light. Joseph, if you would serve me, climb the stairway and look through the casement. Do not let them see you, and do not stay long. Come down as soon as you can and tell me that my uncle is alive and well."

"I will. But first you go in and stay with mother. You can sleep here tonight if you wish, and tomorrow I will ask my father what can be done."

He knocked at the door, but without waiting for his mother to come, ran up the second flight of stairs and reached out for the first board of the rude staircase. When he had found it he managed the ascent by clinging to the rail at the side, for the steps here were much steeper than those below; indeed, in the dark it seemed to him a dizzy bit of a climb, but he managed it nimbly and found when he reached the landing that he could just peep in through one corner of the opened window shutter. Had the shutter been closed, as it usually was, he could have seen nothing, for the glass, consisting of little round uneven blocks, was unglazed and set into a network of lead. Through the opening he peered, clinging to the railing of the stairsfor support, and keeping one foot close to the top step, in order to descend in haste at the first hint that the occupants of the room were aware of the presence of a third person.

What he saw at first glance startled him, for the loft was literally blazing with light coming from oils burning in four copper braziers which hung from the ceiling. Above these braziers, to protect the roof from the heat, were layers of metal, one separated from the other, so that an air current played between them and cooled them. A fifth brazier, not now alight, hung close to the window where Joseph was peering, and it was from this brazier that the dame had sprung that had lighted up the whole court—as a matter of fact, the light had come from the rapid combustion of a handful of powder which the alchemist had thrown on the brazier's charcoal.

The loft itself was higher than the boy had realized—there was but one large room in it, for on the farther side could be seen the shutters of the building's outer wall. In the middle of the room at the back was a closet—for Pan Kreutz's most valuable substances, Joseph decided, since it was fastened with chains as well as with a huge lock and key. The beams of the roof, sloping but slightly, were well above the height of a tall man and were not of bare wood, as is common in lofts and attics, but were plastered over with some thick white substance.

In the center of the room stood a tripod supporting an iron basin, and in it was burning some substance that gave a peculiar pungent odor.

The alchemist in his black robe and the student Tring in his leather jacket sat elbow to elbow before this basin. They were watching something that was burning there in flames of many colors.

"It takes away my strength," Joseph heard the alchemist tell Tring, "to experiment in the fashion which you have suggested. It has interested me, and I know that it has its fascination, but it is not, after all, in my sphere. I am an alchemist, one who seeks the truth above all things in the actions and reactions of material substances. I mix vinegar and sugar and soda, and there is immediately a bubbling and a change. Something new is created. I melt lead and silver and copper, and they form together some metal that is new."

"But are not these changes influenced also by the position of the stars in heaven?" asked Tring.

"Yes, and no. The sea, I admit, seems to follow the pull of the moon. Harvests depend upon seasons and seasons sometimes seem to be servants of the movements of the heavenly bodies. But as to other things I know not. Besides, I am not an astrologer. I am an alchemist. The powers of the sky may be found by those who search the skies."

"But is not the conduct and life of man governed by the stars?"

"That I leave to magicians and necromancers, as likewise I leave to them that hideous magic which makes compounds of cats' paws, and owls' eyes, and dead men's fingers."

"But," persisted the student, "you seek the elixir of life, do you not?"

"No," answered the alchemist, "although in regard to it I admit that I have much curiosity. If it is true that all things are subject to change, then one might change from old to young as well as from young to old if one could but find the laws to reverse the process of life. And as to this I do not doubt that a restorer of youth can be found. Yet I am not interested as are those who have lived vain livesand hope to do better if life may be relived."

"The Philosophers' Stone, what think you of that?" Joseph noticed a distinct change in the student's voice as he said this; his eyes shone with a greedy light, and his fingers seemed to curl perceptibly.

"Well," answered the alchemist, "that is indeed much sought. To the superstitious and ignorant the Philosophers' Stone means only some substance which by magical power can transform all things it touches into gold, like King Midas of ancient days. But to us who study and work, it is apparent that only a process and not a substance can bring this to pass."

"How—how?" demanded the student, leaning forward.

"Well, it is commonly known that each substance in the world, such as brass, or paper, or glass, has certain properties in itself. Did not Archimedes, father of all our learning, establish this truth by the proof that different substances thrown separately into water each displace a different amount of water? Gold is a substance, brass is a substance, both susceptible to change in the elementals, fire, water, air, and earth. Fire melts, water changes the color or disintegrates, air hardens, and earth darkens. To make brass of gold, or gold of brass is not impossible if one might know what would break down the dissimilarity between them."

"Then why do you not keep trying until you find the secret?"

The alchemist drew a long breath. "There are things that interest me more. Though I am an alchemist, I am much concerned with the spirit that is behind material things. I would learn if life itself is a matter of substance, if there is not the same difference between man and man that there is between metal and metal. I would learn thesecrets of the earth, the messages of the sky, and I would know as well the secret of the soul, and how one might seek to help and save the souls of men whose bodies are from birth misshapen. I would learn, if I might, the composition of the earth, the reasons for the spring and summer and such phenomena—I would learn what makes the stars to shine and the sea to be tempestuous. God has given me a mind that searches ever for the light, and I feel that I am doing His will when I seek the truths that lie about us on every hand."

Tring came close and spoke very low, though his voice carried to Joseph at the casement.

"You are a fool, you, Pan Kreutz," he said. "Here are you, the most gifted scholar and alchemist of our time, fretting away your hours in such pursuits, with a much greater object to be gained at your very elbow."

"You mean—"

"You know what I mean. You and I have begun to experiment in things that men know but little of."

"I know, and I am of two minds about it. There is something in what you persuade me into that I like not. But upon such matters you are indeed the teacher and I the student. This I do know, and that is that when I am in a trance such as you sent me into a short time ago I can see things and hear things and even know things that I am not familiar with in my everyday mind. But such experiments, though they enthrall the soul, are perhaps dangerous to men. They are tried in Nuremberg, I believe, and in other lonely places in the Black Forest. But here in Krakow we have ever been wary of them."

The alchemist was looking into the fire. Tring, sitting beside him, cast at him at these words such a malicious look and leerthat Joseph shuddered. There flashed into Joseph's mind the word "demon"—a veritable demon from the darkness Tring seemed, striving to exert some influence over his victim.

The look passed. "Pan Kreutz," began Tring again, "I know from my teachers in the old town of Nuremberg that man has in reality two brains. One of these brains is wise and powerful and dominant, and yet one knows nothing of it except when one is asleep in such a trance as I put you in but a short while ago. The other is the brain of daily life; by it we know when to eat, work, and rest. It is the lesser brain."

"Something of this you have proven to me," said the alchemist.

"Then use your higher brain," commanded Tring.

"To what end?" asked Kreutz.

"To the end that all men would reach. Gold!"

He said the word with an intensity that sent a cold thrill through Joseph.

"Gold matters not so much to me," answered the alchemist.

"It does—it does—it does," insisted Tring. "You do not know what you could do with it. With this secret, you and I could become the very kings of the earth. We could live in the finest palace in the world—we could have diamonds and rubies and emeralds—we could travel about the lands of Europe like the mightiest of merchant princes—armies would be at our disposal, and we could make every human being perform our will."

For a moment he forgot the alchemist as he reveled in this dream made out of fancy and desire, but as a glance at Kreutz's face found no response there, he went on more cunningly:

"Think what you could do as an alchemist! Is this attic a fittingplace for your experiments? Are these poor tools sufficient for the concoctions that you would devise and for the laws which you would prove? You could become the greatest alchemist in Poland— in the world! You could work in a room that would contain this poor attic a dozen times. In it would be every instrument that has ever been invented for the study of alchemy. No precious substance that comes out of the East, no priceless gem nor precious stone would be beyond the means that you would possess. Does this not tempt you?"

He had touched him this time. "It would tempt any poor scholar," Kreutz replied, in the voice of one who had seen a sudden vision. Then more keenly, "But do you think that I possess in myself, my greater self as you call it, this secret of changing base metals into gold?"

"I am sure of it"—Tring was almost dancing about his chair in eager enthusiasm—"if you will cease being a plodding scholar and a fool and set yourself night and day to conquer this problem of the universe. Gold—gold—gold—that is what every man wants. Success always means gold, and those who work all their lives professing none but unselfish motives are but deceiving others in order to make themselves reverenced—some of them perhaps are deceiving themselves. Why, with gold—think what you could do for your niece, think what you could do for the students of the university— you could make this school and, aye, the whole kingdom of Poland the greatest and most desired place in all the world."

Kreutz thought deeply for some minutes. It was quite evident even to Joseph, young and inexperienced as he was, that Tring had utterly poisoned the alchemist's mind. Indeed, now Kreutz, lookingat life through the philosophy of Tring, saw that his own life was the life of a dusty plodder; it was the life not only of a poor man but of a foolish man who might be better off if he wished, who now had the opportunity to do a great deal for those whom he loved, if he would but set himself to it. His thoughts had been on a plane too high for practicality. He had idealized mankind and he had tried to learn things which had seemed to him to be the very jewels of knowledge in the crown of wisdom—yes, that was what he had been, a dusty old plodder.

And with these thoughts he surrendered utterly to Tring. "You are right, I truly believe," he said with a sigh, "perhaps then we can possess this secret which will make us kings of the earth, as you say. With gold we can do these things, we can accomplish what we wish in the world, we can help the struggling, cure the sick, and do away with poverty entirely in this kingdom. Yes, it is, after all, a noble task—shall we repeat the experiment again tonight? Shall I enter into a trance again?"

"Nay," Tring had gained his end, "it is getting late and I would not repeat the experiment so shortly after the first trial, for fear perhaps that it would not be so successful as before. Tomorrow evening we shall try it, when we are both fresh again.... It was curious that tonight, when you were in the deepest part of the trance, you called out that that which every astrologer, alchemist, and magician has sought for centuries was within a few yards of the place where you sat. I had begun to think that we were upon the eve of a great discovery."

"Aye, it was then that something awoke me," said the alchemist.

"Yes, the worse for us all," said Tring sourly. "It was a cry thatbrought you to your senses, upon the eve of so great a revelation. It was the cry of your niece from the room below."

"Elzbietka," exclaimed the alchemist with concern. "And why did she cry?"

"You were not silent in your trance. You shouted that there were some demons near by ready to kill you—you almost screamed in your fear—and then you talked as if your tongue were a pendulum."

"And I did not answer the child?"

"No. You sank back in your chair again, asleep, and this time it was a natural sleep, for when I questioned you again, you said nothing."

The alchemist rubbed his eyes. "I am sleepy now, in faith." Then, wondering, "What could have been the revelation? I know of no prize that could be near by. On the ground floor is the old woman, and her half-wit son, whom I frighten with fire—then on the second floor, but the three poor refugees installed recently. Across the court, only you and two poor students. No, it can be nothing in the possession of any one of these. Well, as you say, this for tonight is enough—" And at these words Joseph scampered down the stairway.





VIII. PETER OF THE BUTTON FACE


Summer burned itself into fall. The Vistula, which had been growing ever lower and lower with the heat, was now but a narrow ribbon of water, and the banks along it were parched and dried and yellow. Leaves were changing from green to brown, and the birds were making ready to leave for southern lands as soon as the first suggestion of cold should appear. Across the meadows now the horses and wagons were marching daily, and the dry hay was filling barn and shelter in all the country about. The fruits of the autumn were already appearing in the market, the apples of the first bearing, the golden squashes, and the late cabbage. And over the city and country hung a sky of deep, exquisite blue, for in all the world there is no sky so blue as is the Krakow sky, and no sun is so gold as is the sun of early autumn.

When the Month of the Heather had passed by and the Month of Hemp Beating was at hand, Joseph had learned all the notes of the Heynal and could play the little hymn upon his father's trumpet. Once, even, he had played it in the tower; on that night his father had played it toward the west, south, and east, and then had allowed the boy to play it at the north window.

The girl, Elzbietka, a little quicker of ear than Joseph, had long since mastered the air and quickly memorized Joseph's notes, so that she could not only hum the music, but reproduce it in writing upon awall or piece of parchment.

One evening when Elzbietka was visiting Joseph's mother—and she came more and more frequently now, since the alchemist had began to carry on new experiments with Tring—Joseph exclaimed suddenly:

"Before long I shall play all four Heynals."

She let her chin rest upon one hand, as she did often when she thought and when she spoke seriously. "I shall listen," she said. "It comforts me more than ever now when I hear the hymn played in the nighttime—since there is seldom anyone in our rooms when I awake. Joseph," she spoke in a very low tone, "do you know I think that my uncle is possessed?"

He gave a great start. "Possessed—and by whom?"

"I don't know. But he isn't himself. It isn't that he is out of his wits—no, not that at all. He is just as intelligent and just as kind as he ever was, but he has become so interested in something that he is doing in the loft that he thinks but little of me or of his friends in the world. There is that student, Johann Tring—"

"Yes, I know," he answered quickly.

"He and my uncle are together in the loft every night. Sometimes they stay there until it is light. They say queer things, and sometimes my uncle cries out as if he were in pain. You heard them the night that I told you to go up the stair-case. It is always like that."

"I told Father what I heard that night," said Joseph, "and he only said that it was none of our affair, that your uncle is a man who has been very kind to us, and who knows what he is about. Also he forbade me ever to spy upon your uncle again. Father said that youruncle is a great scholar and that he is now probably working upon something that will win him fame."

"Aye—perhaps," she meditated, "but I loved him better as he was."

From that time on Elzbietka became more and more a part of Pan Andrew's family. In the afternoons she used to bring her sewing downstairs into the front room and sit there for hours working and chatting or humming little tunes under her breath. When Joseph returned from his studies in the afternoon the two were accustomed to walk out into the city and see its changing wonders, its new caravans, its pageants, its companies of knights and soldiers, its processions of guilds. Often they walked out through the gates into the country, where there was rich black earth, and behind them or alongside or ahead ran the great Tartar dog. The walks took them to the old Jewish city of the Kazimierz, across the fortified bridge on the west arm of the Vistula, to the old church on the Skalka where the holy Stanislas was murdered at his altar, to the high mound above the city where it was said that old King Krakus was buried; to these and to many other places had they wandered while the sun was bright and the air not too cool.

Once they went to visit the towers of the Church of Our Lady Mary in the late afternoon. The watchman let them in at the little gate at the base of the tower and they climbed up to the room where the day trumpeter was on duty. He was the man that Pan Andrew relieved at night, and he thought it a great honor to have a visit from such a little lady as Elzbietka, and he told her many of the legends which have come down from old days, when the church tower was being built.

Joseph picked up his father's trumpet from the table. "When I first play all the four Heynals you must listen and see if you hear a single note played wrong."

"I will listen."

"If I play a wrong note, I will give you my cap. If I play two, then I will give you Wolf." He smiled then, as a boyish thought came to him. "If I ever play the Heynal through to the end, without stopping at the broken note, then you may run to Jan Kanty and tell him to summon the watch, for then something will have happened to me."

"How do you mean?" She was, as ever, serious, though he was smiling.

"You know the story of this hymn, the Heynal?"

"Yes," she answered.

"How, when the Tartars burned the city, the trumpeter stayed on duty and played the hours as he had sworn?"

"Yes.... A brave story."

"Well"—Joseph liked to see the blue eyes widen—"one night the Tartars will attack the city, or perhaps the Knights of the Cross. I shall see them coming from afar, in the midst of fire and smoke, and I shall hear war cries and their horses' hoofs. And I shall be all alone in the tower that night, for neither my father nor any person will be here. And when I realize that it is an enemy, I must have a signal, since I myself may not leave the tower—a signal to someone in the town who will give the alarm. So I will play the Heynal, but I will not stop on the broken note. That note does not end the measure, you know. I will play on, two or three notes further."

"Excellent," she cried, and her cheeks were red with theexcitement of it. "If I hear you play the Heynal without stopping at the broken note, I will run straight to Jan Kanty."

"Now come look at the city," he broke off conversation on the subject. He was a little ashamed, for he had not expected Elzbietka to take his remarks quite so seriously. She had not taken the trumpet signal as the jest he intended, but had rejoiced at it, as do most young people when they have a secret with some important person. And, to her, Joseph was a person of very great importance, not only because of his prowess with the trumpet and his progress in the collegium but because, indeed, he possessed somehow more than ordinary seriousness for a boy of his age.

They peered through a little window. Off to the right ran the Street of St. Florian, with the gate and church beyond: new towers were being constructed that very year in the walls that ran about the city, and two of them near the Florian Gate were visible from the tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary. To each city guild was assigned one of these towers, to be kept in repair and to be manned in case of attack on the city. The joiners' and the tailors' guilds had watchtowers near this gate. Between these watchtowers and the church were many palaces with large enclosures in the center, open to the sun, where guards and soldiers were working or waiting or disporting themselves, breaking each other's heads with quarter-staves, or fencing, or shooting with arrows at pigeons tied to the tops of high poles.

Directly below them the market was still busy, although it was late afternoon, for the peasants were ready to sell at small profit what remained of their stock and go home; under the arches of the Cloth Hall the crowds were still passing from booth to booth, examiningthe laces and embroidery and fine silks that had come in from the east and south; beyond the Cloth Hall rose the tower of the Town House, or Ratusz, and in front of it two luckless wretches struggled in the pillory while a crowd of urchins pelted them with mud and decayed vegetables. To the left rose the peak of the Church of the Franciscans—they passed to the south window and there saw the twin towers of the old Church of St. Andrew, and far beyond it the great rock citadel, the Wawel, with its palace and cathedral glorious in the afternoon sun.

There were blue shadows already lengthening across the market when they descended from the tower and crossed the market square. Against the palaces that lined the open space there were more shadows, and moving like shadows within these shadows promenaded black-gowned students and masters. They were moving definitely in one direction, and when once caught up in the crowd, Joseph and Elzbietka followed, unresisting, for they knew that some excitement was afoot in the students' quarter.

The black figures grew constantly more and more numerous, until at length the two stopped and pushed right and left in an endeavor to reach a position of vantage in front of the dormitory in St. Ann's Street. The dormitory was set back from the street, and in front was an open court, grassed over, in the center of which was a stone statue of Kazimirthe Great, the founder of the university. Here, upon the pedestal of this statue, leaning back upon the throne which bore Kazimir, stood a man in the gown of a master of arts, speaking to the assembled students in the Latin language.

"I heard of him today," Joseph told Elzbietka. "He is a celebrated Italian scholar who comes here to read the writings of themaster poets and to recite some verses of his own. He talks of poets who bear such names as Dante and Petrarch, and he says that the day will come when a new learning will rule the world. He says that men have been in darkness too long, that the barbarism which fell upon the world after the downfall of Pome will be done away with only when men write in their native tongues and think for themselves."

"And can you really understand him when he speaks?"

"After a fashion. He speaks Latin, as do all our masters and priests and scholars. My father had teachers for me when I was eight years old, and since then I have worked much with the Latin tongue. At first it pleased me not at all, for there were rules and tables and grammar, but when I began to understand that Latin would admit me into the proudest society of the world, then I began to like it better. In the months that I have been here my teaching has all been in Latin, and I hope, myself, to be able to speak it fluently sometime. I can understand much, though not all."

"Why does not this Italian poet speak, then, in the university?"

"He might, perhaps—but to a certain extent it would stir up strife, since there are those among the masters who do not like the New Learning, as it is called. Our old teachings are all of the great Aristotle, and yet we have never read anything of him in the Greek language—everything that we study is in Latin. We have many treatises upon learning which the masters have used for centuries, and most of them do not desire to change their ways."

The Italian scholar at that moment began to read his own verses in the Latin tongue. He had scarcely finished, amid much acclaim, when a Polish scholar mounted the pedestal and began to read some of his verses written in the Polish language.

"Why do they not all do that?" asked Elzbietka. "One can understand them so much better. If I were a poet, I should not think of writing in an old language that no one speaks except a few scholars. I would write of Poland and its flowers; I would write of the trumpeter in the tower and the blue sky that one sees behind the castle on Wawel Hill. Truly, I like this New Learning as you call it."

Joseph smiled but knew not what to say.

"And," she continued, "why is not this learning as good for women as it is for men? Why is it that all writings of poets and scholars and men of learning should be read only by men? I would read such writings too."

It was said with such gravity and such an air of wisdom that at first Joseph was inclined to smile, but as he looked into her face and saw the seriousness there, he desisted.

"Truly," he said finally, "I know not why you should not read as do men, but I know of no woman who ever entered the university."

As they turned through a short lane from St. Anne's Street to the Street of the Pigeons they failed to notice a pair of men conversing quietly behind the buttress of a house on the farther side. Both were of short stature, and one was much bent—as he spoke he raised his long, lean fingers close to his mouth:

"Sh-h.... That is the boy."

The other started and turned quickly, but appeared puzzled. "When did you say he came?"

The bent-over man, who was no other than Stas, son of the woman who lived in the court, gave the date to a day.

"Then it must be he," exclaimed the other. "On the day that I saw him he was dressed like a country youth and his clothes weredusty from travel. Today he is arrayed in velvet like any prince and has besides the cap of a junior collegian. But his stature is the same. And you say that he lives above you?"

"Yes. Goes by the name of Kovalski."

"H'm—it was Charnetski when I knew him.... Now, you, look at me—do you see this piece of gold? That's true gold, red gold, an' will buy many a dainty or many a drink. That is to be yours, for your very own."

Stas almost shrieked for joy when the stranger put the piece of money in his hand.

"But, look you—no talking about this anywhere else. This is my business, mine and yours, and I tell you that when we are finished there will be more gold pieces for you just like that. Now show me the place where they live."

They followed along until Joseph and Elzbietka stood before the entrance to the court.

"That is the place," said Stas.

"Well and good. Now keep a close watch and let me know anything that is new. I will be at the Inn of the Golden Elephant every afternoon at the third hour, but do not tell anyone there that you are looking for me. Let your words be only for my ears. And remember, the lantern in the man's face tonight. There will be much gold for you. You understand?"

The man did. His very shoulders seemed to chuckle at the thought of it. He let himself into the court and went at once to his room.

In the meantime the other walked briskly to the inn and sat down at a table. His thoughts were dancing in his head, for by anextraordinary piece of luck he had succeeded in locating the family of Pan Andrew. Luck indeed it was, because never, if he had come upon him face to face in the street, would he have known Joseph at all. It was only because Stas had named him as the son of the man who went abroad only by night that he could see any resemblance to that boy who had sent his horse flying away through the mud on that morning so many weeks before. For this man was that same one who called himself Stefan Ostrovski.

They disappeared that day after the riot—he thought to himself as he sat in the inn—and were nowhere to be found. The earth might have opened and swallowed them whole. No other Charnetski in Krakow answered their description—I had well given them up for lost, and with them, a castle and coffers of gold in the Ukraine. For when Ivan, himself, promises, then there is profit to be had. I return to the Ukraine, but there is no word from them there. My men are even now riding from city to city in the vain hunt. Meanwhile I, answering some tiny voice of wisdom that speaks from somewhere into my ear, come back here.

He struck the table with his fist. "Men call me Bogdan Grozny-Bogdan the Terrible," he exclaimed. "But terror often has brains. This venture has begun in luck and must end well. And once I get what I seek from that white-faced Pole he shall rue the day of my humiliation at the Krakow Gate." And with the thought of that adventure, a look of hatred came into his eyes.

His attention was diverted for the moment by the sight of a beggar with a dirty bandage across his face working from table to table at the inn, begging for alms in a whining tone.

As the beggar came near, the man dropped a coin in the out-stretched hand and whispered, "You come late today."

"Pardon me, master, I thought I had a scent."

The beggar seemed to expect a blow, and assumed a defensive attitude, when the man smiled.

"No matter, the work is done," he whispered. "Mount your horse tonight and ride like the wind for Tarnov. There you will send out our brothers to bring in the men who are hunting. It may take three weeks—but hurry before the first fall of snow comes."

The beggar took the orders, ambled out of the inn quietly, just as he had come in, and proceeded in like fashion until he was well along the street which skirts the market on the west. Then, suddenly stepping behind a house buttress, he tore the bandage from his face and ran with all speed for the gate on the Mogilev Road, in order to get through unchallenged before

the night watch came on duty. He passed through, sauntered down the road until he came to a small peasant cottage with a stable in the rear; here he found the horse which he had ridden to Krakow, and with a single word to the owner of the house, who seemed to understand his movements fully, galloped off to the distant bridge where ran the Tarnov Road.

The man at the inn continued to ruminate. That stoop-shouldered misbegotten thing that calls himself Stas came to us like an angel from heaven. Often had I noticed him in here, talking and making free with all the beggars, and even at first look of him, I thought to myself that here was such a man as might serve a purpose for me sometime. So I have the landlord bring him a friendly glass, and talking as he drinks it, he drops a word about the new trumpeter who never goes forth in the daytime! That is the boy as sure as man canbe sure, despite his new trappings of velvet; and then the fact that there are three of them, and the date of their arrival. Tonight when the trumpeter leaves by the door, Stas will hold the lantern to his face, and I, hiding near by, will see—but there is scarce need of that, it is as well as proved. My men will be here in a week or two, and it will be but short work after that.

His face was working pale in his excitement—it was all white save the button mark which stood out on it like a clot of blood.

What would the honorable Pan Andrew have said that day—he chuckled—had he known that Bogdan Grozny was before him? For he, and every man in the Ukraine, knows Peter of the Button Face. That was a good name I gave him—Ostrovski! Ostrovski of the proud family at Chelm that once called me slave.

Peter of the Button Face was indeed a name feared everywhere in the Ukraine. It had been bestowed upon this man, whose real name was Bogdan, chiefly by the Poles, for among the Cossacks he was known as Grozny, or Terrible. A savage outcast, born of a Tartar mother and Cossack father, he had been involved in every dark plot on the border in the last ten years. Houses he had burned by the score, and men and women he had put to death cruelly. Under his command was a band of ruffians who would rise up suddenly in the Ukraine, overnight almost, and set out upon any adventure of fire and sword that he suggested.

He was not despised by great folk either—Polish or Muscovite-when there was unlawful work to be done; nobles often employed him for unscrupulous tasks that they dared not perform themselves; the Great Khan of the Tartars even had dispatched him on a mission among the Golden Horde; his name was a power on both sides of theboundary, for in Poland also he had confederates who served him.

And at the present time the great country of the Ukraine, which had come to Poland through the marriage of Jagiello of Lithuania with Jadviga of Poland about one hundred years previous—this huge land was full of plots and counterplots in the struggle for mastery between Muscovy and Poland. Ivan of Moscow had already begun to turn envious eyes upon this territory, which had been the heart of the old Byzantine Russia with Kiev as its capital, and was making plans to wrest it from Poland at the first opportunity. And in such fashion many a dweller such as Pan Andrew Charnetski found himself bereft of property and fields in a single night. For there were many such as Bogdan the Terrible, or as the Poles knew him, Peter of the Button Face, who were ready at a minute's notice to engage in some such fearful task with rewards of plunder and captives for their work.

However, little realizing what savage forces had been let loose against them, the family of Pan Andrew sat down to a quiet supper.





IX. BUTTON-FACE PETER ATTACKS


Cold weather came in late November—or Listopad, the month of Falling Leaves, as Polish folk call it—and found the poor people in the villages already fortified in their log huts with the thatched roofs. Sand had been heaped high about the walls of the houses, all crevices that led to the outer world were stopped up with mud or tree branch or stone, wood and charcoal were piled under table and bench, and from the ceiling hung dried vegetables and mushrooms and sausage. The geese and pigs still ran about outside the house but would be taken in with the first frost, to share the "black" or large compartment of the hut with the family. In the second or "white" compartment of the hut the whole family slept when the weather was not too frigid, but when the snow was up to the roof level, and the cold was so great that one could hear trees cracking in the night, all slept in the "black" room which had not even a chimney to vent the smoke that poured out steadily from an open fireplace.

In the city houses, wealthy men were beginning to build high tile stoves of Italian pattern, but for the most part, people depended for heat and comfort upon the open fireplace. When the first frost came boys ran hither and thither with flaming coals for starting the first fires; up in the tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary the watchmen kept eyes constantly wide open in order to detect as quickly as possible the patches of flame which sometimes broke outfrom the roofs of over-heated dwellings, and many a troublesome night was spent by the water master and his men quenching such fires.

A light snow was falling on the last Wednesday of the month, when Pan Andrew started for his nightly duties at the church. The world had been going well with him, he reflected, as he made his way through the dark and well-nigh deserted streets: his son was making marked progress in the collegium, his wife was happy and contented, he himself was earning enough to support them both comfortably, and he hoped that before long he would have a chance to present his offering to the king. For it had not been possible thus far to gain an audience; either the king had been away on business in Torun with soldiers and diplomats, or he was in Vilna, the home of the Jagiello dynasty, which now ruled Poland, or in Lvov, where the Ruthenian subjects lived.

In the short snatches of time when he had been in Krakow neither Pan Andrew nor Jan Kanty had been able to reach him, because so many had been waiting ahead of them—the ambassadors from the Czechs who came to offer him the crown of Bohemia, the delegation from Pome, the scholars from Italy, the deputation from the Teutonic Knights asking for a compact against the Hussites, and other men of title and power.

This delay was no great cause of concern to Pan Andrew, however, since an audience was eventually assured. Late in the summer Jan Kanty had sent a petition to the very throne itself, and the king had advised the gentle scholar by message that he would see him at the first opportunity. In the meanwhile the treasure seemed hidden in as safe quarters as Pan Andrew could ask for.

It was several hours after Pan Andrew had left his lodgings on the Street of the Pigeons that there came a violent ringing of the bell that summoned Stas. Stas unfastened the door and thrust his lantern directly into the face of the man who stood there, and for his pains was rewarded with a smart blow upon the chin which tumbled him into the soft snow which was now beginning to cover everything.

"Don't do that again as you value your life," the stranger muttered as he picked up the fallen lantern and straightened the limp Stas upon his feet. "You fool, don't you know that someone might have seen my face? If some watchman took me, he would as well take you; it is for your safety that no man knows anything of this meeting. Is everything ready?"

"Yes," responded Stas a bit ruefully.

"Then tell me, who is in the building?"

"Well—-there is the lodger on the top floor and his niece, and there is the boy and his mother."

"The students?"

"They have gone to a discussion at the Hungarian pension. Sometimes they do not return before daybreak."

"Good! Then we can work without fear. A dozen men will suffice, four to enter the rooms of Pan Andrew, four to quiet the tenants if need be, and four to stand at the gate. If the guard should come, we can silence him."

"Will you see the stairs?"

"Yes, they live—"

"Up one flight." They ascended the stairs, Stas in the lead. It seemed to the stranger that the staircase swayed a little beneath their feet.

"We must take care here," he muttered. "It seems as if a weight would bring this down."

Just then a dog began to bark in the court below.

"What is that?" demanded the man, turning on Stas. "You did not tell me of a dog."

"He is chained," replied the other. "Will you give me the gold now?"

"Here." The man thrust him a few coins. He took them greedily and felt them over in the darkness, for the stranger was holding under his coat the lantern that he had picked up from the ground.

"This is not all?" Stas' voice rose to a whine.

"Swine!" For a moment the man lost control of himself. "Here is the rest, then," and he swung his free hand to Stas' throat, and sank his fingers in the flesh. Stas fought but could not release himself from those fingers that dug like iron points—at length the man freed him.

"No more of that," he admonished. "The next time you will find yourself in paradise, or some other world. Listen, fool, once and for all—if all goes well here, I will give you double of that which you already have. But if you betray me, or make one foolish blunder, then you will receive, not gold, but a punishment that is worse than anything you dream of."

Stas beat a retreat down the stairs, the stranger behind him.

"Remember," was the final admonishment, "we will be here just after the second hour has sounded. Let us in, and your part in this is finished."

Now it so happened than Pan Kreutz, the alchemist, was working alone in the loft above his room that night. He had alreadyfinished one experiment, and was about to begin a more difficult one, when his attention was caught by the sudden barking of a dog in the court beneath.

What can that be? he thought. There is no moon to cause barking, nor does the dog bark at any of the dwellers in the court.

He quickly threw a covering over the lantern that lighted the loft, and opened the door so that he might look down.

His suspicions that all was not well in the court were confirmed in the next second, when he heard a whispered conversation somewhere below, while the stairs creaked as if two persons were ascending. Then all at once came an exclamation of pain in a voice that he recognized as Stas'.

More whispering, and the footsteps descended.

The next instant the alchemist, leaning forward to listen, heard the stranger's final instruction to Stas.

There is, then, some mischief afoot, he decided. Doorkeepers do not let honest visitors into any house at two o'clock in the morning.

He re-entered the attic room, and uncovered the lantern after making fast the door. For some time he puzzled about what he had heard. Who was the stranger, and what business did he have with Stas, the watchman? And what ought he to do about it? He was for a moment minded to notify the night watch.

I am perhaps magnifying things, he finally concluded. More than likely two o'clock on the morrow was meant. Besides, I myself could give any marauder here a very warm reception—he glanced about the loft. The thought seemed to please him, for he chuckled for the space of a moment, and then turned seriously to his work.

For an hour or more his experiment, which was difficult andexacting, held all his attention. But when it was finally finished and the results carefully noted, the thought of Stas and his mysterious visitor returned to him. In the stillness of the late hour the affair seemed to show a graver face.

He jumped up suddenly and set the fires leaping in two braziers. He melted a gum in one of them and heated some liquid in the other. At length at the end of fifteen minutes he covered the fires and took out the substances. With a small brush he smeared the mixture of the two over his long student gown that hung against the wall. Then he took the mask, which he used when making experiments with certain poisonous gases, and covered this with the same drug he had compounded in the braziers—the gum causing it to cling to the surface of the mask.

I have but to sprinkle this with aqua phosphorata, he said to himself, and the heavens will not be more brilliant than I.

He sat back in his chair to wait, and with closed eyes tried to reason it all out. What can be the meaning of this? he thought. The stranger with Stas stopped on the landing of Pan Andrew's lodging. What mystery can have attached itself to this family? Why should the name be changed? Who would seek revenge upon a man and a woman and a boy? Elzbietka has found a mother, and I good friends. They have no treasure with them, no money of any kind, for even on that first day Pan Andrew was obliged to sell his cart and horses for the means of living.

He was becoming drowsy, for he had worked much of late, and had had but little sleep, and he was on the point of succumbing to his weariness when he heard the watchman at the Church of Our Lady Mary strike twice upon the bell and then begin to play the Heynal.The fourth Heynal was scarcely finished when he heard a motion in the court below. It was Stas creeping along the wall in order to open the door. Throwing back his door noiselessly the alchemist lay flat on the floor and leaned out over the threshold. The door below creaked a little as it opened. Someone came in. The alchemist listened: One—two—three—more! By the lightning, there must be a dozen of them, if footsteps tell no lies. I did wrong not to notify the watch. If I shout now, he may come, but there are enough to silence both him and me. No, I have made my beer and I must drink it.

Next the stairs began to creak, and almost instantly the hoarse barking of a dog cut through the air.

"Silence that dog," he heard someone whisper from the steps. Footsteps were heard again in the court as if someone had gone back to combat the animal. At this same moment the door leading into the court was slammed shut, and there was a rattle of the chain that fastened it on the inside.

A precious jewel, that Stas, thought the alchemist. He shall pay for this tomorrow.

A cry of pain rang out suddenly from below. It was the cry not of a dog, but of a man. Ha, thought Pan Kreutz, Wolf finished that one.

There was a sound of a man running across the court. "I can't get near him without injury," he whispered loudly to the leader of the party. "He sank his teeth in my leg, and I am faint for pain."

"Three of you attack him at once," directed the leader.

There was scuffling again, and suddenly the night was made hideous with the mad howling and barking of Wolf and the shrieking of men in pain; at this moment Joseph, with a light in his hand,appeared at the door on the second story:

"Wolf—Wolf," he called.

He did not call again.

Whew, thought the alchemist, they silenced the boy. A gag, probably.

He was right. The leader of the attacking party had seized Joseph and thrown a cloth bag over his head.

"To the house," he shouted to the men below. "Four of you stand guard at the door. Four of you wait at the stairs and let no one descend, and the rest come with me."

As the light of the lantern which he had taken from the boy swung upon his face, the man watching above could see that it was marked with a great round scar like an immense button.

"Tartar or Cossack," he exclaimed, "for the plague which leaves such scars is an Eastern plague; these men have come from a long distance."

He was right. This was indeed the band of that ruffian whom the Poles called Peter of the Button Face and whose bad fame men knew in all the Ukraine and the lands to the east.

In the next second, almost, they were inside the house—Peter, and three men following. There came to the alchemist's ears the scream of a woman, followed by a crash as if she had been thrown upon the floor. Then came the sound of the breaking of furniture, of the tearing up of matting, of the destruction of everything within the house as if a quick, violent search was being made. The door was open and the alchemist could hear clearly all the sounds below.

"Look in the bed," the leader spoke.

Pan Andrew and his wife slept in a large bed in the front room.Swords were quickly at work ripping this to pieces. They cut open the pillows, they tore apart the blankets, and it was only after the bed was a complete ruin that the leader found what he had been seeking.

"There it is," he shouted; "that large package, done up in cloth."

With his sword he ripped away the layers of cloth that bound it—one by one they fell away upon the floor until the object he sought stood uncovered in his right hand. But just at that instant, as he was about to dart for the door, there came a shrill voice, shrieking, "My gold—my gold!"

Peter turned like a flash. "Blood of a dog—"

The lantern was held up. Its light disclosed the face of Stas, maddened with the fear that he should not receive the price of his treachery.

"Gold! I'll give you gold," shouted Peter, infuriated. "Someone take him and throw him down to the dog. Then he can take what gold we choose to throw him."

Two men seized him, but he fought madly and dashed into the room. There the third man headed him off and the two others fell upon him from behind; his slim body wriggled loose, however, and he fell across the table already over-turned by the intruders in their search for Pan Andrew's treasure and clung there with ferociousness to the upturned legs. He kicked, he bit, he struck out blindly—but they tore him loose just as Peter set the prize on the floor to take the man in hand himself.

The lantern rested on the floor behind him, and as the struggling men swung toward him, Stas, shot with a brilliant idea, worked a leg loose and kicked the lantern over. As it fell, the door swung open and the candle went out. Almost instantly, however, the ruffiansclosed their grip upon him and hustled him to the door.

Over the rail he would have gone without further ceremony had not there come the sudden screaming of a girl from the floor above.

"The plague upon them all," exclaimed Peter, dropping Stas. "Here everything is as smooth as water in a lake, then all of a sudden babies and fools raise the dead with their cries. Come, we have enough—let us get out of this at once."

He groped his way back to Pan Andrew's bed, and was feeling in the dark for the precious thing that was the object of his raid, when there came a crash like that of thunder from above, and through the open door appeared a terrible red light that seemed to come from the sky and enveloped everything for the moment in a garment of red.





X. THE EVIL ONE TAKES A HAND


Peter rushed to the door and stood, staring.

Balls of red fire were shooting out into the air from the opened casement of the room in the loft, flooding the place with light as they burst with terrific explosions. In the light Peter could see his men standing horror-struck, four below him at the bottom of the stairs, and four on guard at the door. Those who had been clinging to Stas on the landing had recoiled in fright before the fiery balls, and the half-wit had seized the opportunity to slink stealthily away through their legs, and make for the lower steps.

For a moment Peter stood motionless. In bodily things he was braver than the brave, but in the face of such magic as this he was a coward; yet though he trembled, he realized that he must play a man's part if he wished to keep the leadership of his band, and accordingly, spurring himself up to a pitch of bravado, he rushed up the stairs from the second floor to the third and stood there just as another bomb soared out into the air.

"Come back! Come back!" they were shouting from below.

"Come up! Come up!" he commanded. "What are you frightened of?"

"It is the Evil One himself!"

Peter shook his curved Cossack sword in the darkness. "Come up—come up, I tell you, you cowardly dogs—come up or I'llseparate your coward heads from your useless bodies. Come up, I say—come up!"

And so much was he feared that the three men on the second-floor landing crossed themselves in the manner of the Creek Church and went creeping up after him.

"We have the treasure," pleaded the nearest man in a trembling voice, "let us escape from here. This is nothing human. This is the work of the Evil One. Devils are abroad and a man is not sure of his soul."

"Devils," roared Peter, "bones and fiddlesticks! Come up here, you, and be men. This is no devil. This is some joker who values his head but lightly. If we do not silence him, he will alarm the whole city before we get back to the gate."

"Up that," he commanded a second later, shoving the first man against the staircase to the loft. "Up that, and tell us what you see."

The man mounted, trembling violently, for he was sure that the powers of darkness themselves were working against them.

"The door is open here," he whispered, "and no lights within." A man below him on the stairway passed the word along to Peter.

"Then up, every mother's son of you," ordered the leader. "There is a man there. Put a knife in his throat and descend quickly."

The rest pulled themselves up and entered the loft. After a few minutes of impatient waiting Peter climbed the steps himself and pushed himself across the dark threshold.

"What have you found?" he demanded impatiently.

"Nothing," the answer came faintly from one corner of the loft.

"If there is anyone here let him speak now," Peter bellowed. His voice drowned the quiet opening of the door of a closet in the backof the room. "If we find anyone, it will go hard—"

Like a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky the loft was suddenly illuminated with a glow of red fire as there leaped into existence out of the blackness of the night the very incarnation of the Evil One in his worst mood. Clad in fiery garments which smelled of fire and brimstone and which seemed to blaze and burn and give off a greenish smoke and dame, he moved slowly forward, waving in his right hand a scepter of flaming red which was crackling with heat as a green bough crackles when it burns, while from its end little balls of fire were dripping.

It was so sudden, so unexpected, this apparition in a pitch-black world of night, of a red, fiery, glowing devil, that Peter, stouthearted as he was, let out a sudden shriek, and trembled like a leaf.

But if he trembled, the others went mad with fear. "Out! Out!" they shrieked, crowding to the stairway.

Upon their heels came the fantastic demon waving his scepter right and left and favoring first one and then another with smart blows, as they fought to be first at the stairway. Two reached it at one time and went scrambling down, to be joined by the third a second later, who came tumbling down upon them just as they gained the third-floor landing.

Peter, however, stood his ground for a moment. Turning about at the head of the stairs he shouted, "Be you man or demon, I will see what you have in you," and rushed with his drawn sword upon the weird figure. That one simply stood aside as he rushed, and waved his hand in the direction of the man's face.

"Ahew-ahew!" the brigand screamed with pain, for some-thing choking and powdery was filling his eyes and throat. "Help—cowards—I am in the hands of a thousand devils. Help, I say!"

There was no sound outside save the noise of the men scrambling down the next stairway.

Peter stumbled blindly to the steps and fairly slid down them, fearful lest the phantom should follow and give him another dose. But the phantom, though following, did not repeat his attack; he came slowly down the stairs after the retreating party, hurling little bombs of colored fire into the air, which as they exploded flooded the court with lights of rainbow hues.

Below, the din was deafening. The dog had worked his head loose from the bag which had been thrown over it, and was barking at the top of his lungs. Men were shouting and crying out in terror, forgetful of caution and the necessity for silence. Joseph, who had been gagged and bound in the rear room of the family's dwelling, had gotten his feet loose from the ropes and was kicking with all his force against the wooden partition wall, Elzbietka was crying out for aid, and heads were beginning to emerge from open casements in all the adjoining buildings. Someone in the street outside was calling loudly for the watch, and Stas, having rescued himself from one predicament, was for no reason at all pulling at the rope of the bell that hung over the door, its clamor adding to the general uproar.

On the landing at the second floor the three retreating ruffians collided with the four men standing there and almost toppled them into the court. They had barely regained their balance when the lower supports of the stairs, which had been groaning already from the unaccustomed weight and traffic, suddenly collapsed and catapulted the whole company, amidst indescribable turmoil, into the court below. Peter, coming behind the three, managed tosave himself by leaping nimbly to the threshold of Pan Andrew's dwelling, but the flaming figure behind him remained momentarily on the stairs above the second floor where the supports and staircase held firm. Not for long did he remain there, however, for as Peter turned his back to disappear into the house, the pursuer leaped from the lower step of the remaining stairway and landed squarely upon Peter, hurling him with a crash to the floor well inside the front room of Pan Andrew's dwelling.

Below in the court there was a veritable pandemonium: the crashing apart of beam and beam where the staircase struck the ground, the shrieking of the frightened, the moaning of the injured— for two men had been pinned beneath the fallen staircase—the terror and distraction of the ruffians on guard below, whose one idea now was to escape through the outer door before the arrival of the watch.

While all this was transpiring in the court, the alchemist, who with his chemicals and powders had caused all the trouble, shook his heavy scepter, a club smeared with glowing resin, in the face of Peter, who lay prostrate beneath him, and demanded:

"Now—what do you seek here?"

But Peter had gotten some of his courage back, and besides the voice sounded more like that of a man than a devil. "I will not tell!"

"You will!"

"I will not."

"You will be turned over to the watch."

"I care not. They can learn nothing."

"First let us have another look at you."

He carefully drew a fireball from a fold of his gown, keeping his weight upon the man under him and holding one hand at histhroat. The ball he ignited by rubbing it against the floor, and when it was burning he tossed it upon the stone hearth. There was a flash of light and the room was suddenly as bright as even day could make it.

But, after all, he did not look at Peter! For there was something else in the room that claimed his attention at once. It was the large round object that Peter had sought in Pan Andrew's bed—there it lay upon the floor a short arm's length away, gleaming like a thousand prisms of finest glass.

"Oho," he exclaimed, "oho! So that's it. Well, Pan Robber, it seems that your expedition was no ordinary one. No common house looting, this.... Lie still there, or I'll sink these fingers into your windpipe," for Peter had tried to wriggle to one side while the alchemist's attention was taken with the new object.

"Who sent you here?" demanded the latter.

Peter was silent.

"But you must talk. Do you hear that—below?"

It was the night watch shouting, "Stand, in the name of the king."

Peter, whose courage was now revived, since he realized that it was a man and not a devil that he was dealing with, decided to try a little strategy.

"I will tell you all if you will hide me here."

"I give no promises. But tell me what you know."

"Then see that." He twisted one hand away from his captor as if to point toward the shining object on the door, which was now gleaming like a miniature sun in the last rays of the nearly burned-out fireball.

"I see it." The alchemist glanced at it; the instant's relaxation proved fatal, however, for with the moment, the under man's right hand came clear and tore the alchemist's grip from his throat. In the struggle that followed, the alchemist was no match for the lithe and wiry Cossack. They rolled back and forth across the floor, tight in each other's arms, they broke table legs, they brought down crockery from the shelves, they crashed into walls—and through all this the Cossack little by little overcame the advantage which the other had held in the beginning. First he twisted his legs in such fashion that he caught Pan Kreutz's body as if in a vise, a trick that he had learned in the old days in the Ukraine; then he snapped his hands free from the other's grip and wound his arms in under his shoulders. Tighter and tighter he drew arms and legs, until the alchemist's bones began to send out cracking noises; then, with a quick movement, he had reversed their positions and it was he who was on top and the alchemist underneath. Smash! He had bumped the man's head against the floor with all his force, a blow sufficient to stun a giant, and in an instant had tossed him against the wall.

There the alchemist lay.

Like a panther moving to attack, Peter seized the object, which he had come to procure, and leaped for the door.

He did not reach it unscathed. Pan Kreutz had also a last stratagem. It was fortunate for him that when the Cossack bumped his head against the floor, it was his mask that had borne the brunt of the blow—otherwise it is doubtful if he could ever have risen. But when the Cossack tossed him aside he lay there feigning unconsciousness, and as the other turned, he reached with a swiftness as quick as Peter's into a pocket of his gown, where hehad concealed a small package of explosive powder which might be ignited only by concussion. A wonder it was indeed that the powder had not exploded while they were wrestling on the floor.

This Pan Kreutz poised in his right hand as Peter made for the door. In another second the man would be gone—the alchemist caught his balance and hurled the package with all his strength.

It was a fair shot! It caught the Cossack with full force square on the back of the head and burst with a loud report.

Those below, now already turning their attention to the noise and the confusion on the second floor, heard the sharp explosion and saw the court flooded with light. In the midst of the glare there came a shriek that seemed to stir every corner of the courtyard, and almost immediately a man with hair flaming and garments streaked with fire sprang from the threshold of Pan Andrew's lodging to the edge of the stairway that had not collapsed, and darted to the floor above. He stopped there only for one fleeting glance below. The court, blazing with torches and alive with tumult, was full of figures—students, watchmen, soldiers—so that escape that way was impossible. He leaped to the loft stairway and mounted it. Clutching at the roof, which was not far above his head, he swung the low door back until it lay alongside the house and then climbed over it to the roofing. Along this he rushed like a meteor, his blazing hair streaming behind him in a trail of sparks—he leaped to an adjoining roof, and then to another, until he came to a place where the roofs sloped down to a wall, and there he was seen last.

A hue and cry was set up, but the man had escaped. Some said that he ran along the top of the wall and leaped into a monastery garden beyond—others that he only pretended to descend and hadcrept back among the housetops. At any rate, he was not discovered.

When temporary stairs were finally put in place the watchmen released Joseph and his mother from the small room in their own quarters where they had lain bound, and brought Elzbietka down to them. Pan Kreutz, who had retired to his loft, where he shed his torn gown and his mask, was bleeding and weak from his struggle and lost no time in getting into his bed. It was thought by all that the robbers had carried away nothing, but when Pan Andrew returned in the morning the house was searched thoroughly, only to find that the treasure was missing. Spectators swore that Peter could not have carried anything with him when he made his perilous escape over the roofs, and a few said that they had noticed that his hands were empty.

However, hunt high or low as they did, the treasure was gone, and Pan Andrew, in spite of the views of the spectators, was fully convinced that the robber had stolen it.

Those of Peter's band who had been injured in the fall of the stairs or had been unable to escape from the court were taken to jail and sentenced to various punishments. Several were put away into dungeons, where they could do no more harm, two were banished "for a period of ninety-nine years," and the rest were delivered to justice in other towns, where they had committed previous crimes. But the most vigorous questioning could get no information from them, and it was concluded that they knew little of the designs of the leader upon Pan Andrew.

As for Stas, his mother would have naught of him after this act of treachery. She lost little time in turning him out of her house, and never would she receive him back again. It was heard some timelater that he had become a waiter in the Inn of the Golden Elephant, but after the robbery of a guest there one night, he disappeared and was never heard of in Krakow again.

Pan Kreutz, although somewhat unnerved by his share in the encounter, met Pan Andrew in his lodging the next morning and described as fully as he could the man who had been leader in the events of the preceding night. He had scarcely finished when Pan Andrew sprang to his feet and struck the back of his chair with his fist.

"It is as I thought," he exclaimed fiercely, "the man who has assailed me twice before. And now I know for a certainty that it is that half Mongol, half Cossack that calls himself Bogdan and is known as the Terrible throughout the Cossack lands. I have heard of his evil deeds many times, as has every dweller in the Ukraine. And it would be like him indeed to lead this villainy against me. He is a very devil, a man without pity, though I will say a man of the boldest breed that God ever benefited with the gift of breath. We, the Poles of the Ukraine, knew him as Peter of the Button Face, because of the scar which you have seen upon his right cheek, and by that scar I would doubtless have recognized him on the morning when he attacked me outside the Krakow Gate, had I not believed that he carried on his lawless deeds always nearer the border."

Thus saying, he went sorrowfully to his work of repairing the damage done by the Cossack band.





XI. THE ATTACK ON THE CHURCH


Down in the Ukraine that winter, when men went about from habitation to habitation on the little horses that had noses so pointed that they could poke them through the snow and eat the dry grass of the steppe beneath, it was known that a great change had come over a certain Bogdan, called the Terrible along the Dnieper and Volga, and Peter of the Button Face among the Polish colonists. It was not that he had lost so much hair that certain ones called him behind his back Bogdan of the Singed Locks, that made him sad and contemplative instead of boisterous and ready as he had once been— it was the effect of some failure that brought on despondency and kept him a recluse for several months. When he did return at length to men's sight and began to appear in the taverns, his hair had grown to its accustomed length, and a huge scar that fire had made was nearly healed over. It was hinted, too, that he had made a journey clear up to the land of the Muscovites and had had conference with Ivan, called the Great, but this he did not speak about, and men dared not question him.

Spring came with the month of March in the year 1462, with peace over all the Dnieper lands, save where here and there tribes were on the march, or the Tartars were threatening raids. With spring, set out Bogdan the Terrible, and with him traveled as fine a crowd of cutthroats and cattle stealers as ever the Ukraine knew.They rode to Rovno, the town of the Level Plain, and then struck out for Chelm on the border just beyond the River Bug. They established headquarters in the Lublin Woods for a time, for the purpose of pillaging, and then hearing that soldiers had been sent after them, they vanished into the swamplands to the north and were not heard of again in those parts.

It seems that Peter had opposed this pillaging from the first, because he had other work in hand, but they were tribesmen and wild, fond of robbery and theft and eager for gain.

At Tarnov, having them well in hand again, he organized them into a caravan of Armenian rug merchants and marched them—carts, horses, and merchants—to Krakow, the great market of the eastern part of Europe. In Krakow they camped with their wares in the square on the East Side of the Cloth Hall.

Now the saddest man in Krakow at this time was Pan Andrew Charnetski—sad because he had lost, through no fault of his own, a treasure which he had intended to present to the king of Poland, and evidently a treasure of great worth since certain men seemed to envy him its possession. Jan Kanty sought to comfort him, and his wife and son and Elzbietka did much to divert his thoughts from the seriousness of the loss, but on the long nights when he was alone in the tower, moods of depression would often engulf him.

Joseph, knowing this, took to visiting him in the night vigils when it was possible, before holy days and vacations when there was no collegium on the following morning; often he would come with his father at the tenth hour of the night and remain until morning. Sometimes he would take the duties of the watchman while his father slept and sound the Heynals at each hour and inspect the cityregularly from each of the tower windows in order to sound the alarm whenever a red tongue of flame leaped into the sky. Joseph had progressed each day in playing the trumpet and could now sound the Heynal as well as his father.

He was in the tower with Pan Andrew on this same night that Peter and his caravan of merchants were encamped in their carts in the market place below the church. The moon was at its full and the shadows of the church towers fell far across the street and market. Down in front of the church doors a watchman with lantern and halberd paced to and fro calling out, as was his custom, the hours as they were sounded from the tower.

He had already called out the first hour when Peter of the Button Face, watching from a cart across the square, decided to make his first move.

"Michael," he called in a loud whisper, "Michael." And at that, a man in a suit of leather with hat to match and thick sandals slid out of the next cart. He had already divested himself of the round turban and blankets that he wore as an Armenian merchant, and his body seemed to move in a constant succession of quivering and glidings—in fact, lie had always been known in the Ukraine as the Snake—and he stood for a moment by his chief's wagon to receive a whispered command in one ear.

Then, true to his name, he wriggled beneath a dozen carts and past the flank of an outhouse near the church to take refuge behind a tree that grew at this center of the Rynek. Doubled up here, he waited until the watchman should pass in front of the church. He had not long to wait.

Out from the shadows at the base of the church emergedsuddenly a mall carrying a lantern that threw a star-shaped light about it. This man tested the door to the stairs leading to the trumpeter's tower, found it securely locked, yawned, and struck the paving stones several times ill front of the door with his long halberd, as if he were weary of doing nothing. The Snake's eyes sized up this man as his opponent. He was a man perhaps past middle age, clad in a garment of leather over which was a very light chain armor poorly woven; this fell like a skirt with pointed edges just below the knees. Above the waist the links of armor were a hit heavier, extending over the shoulders and hack into long sleeves clear to the wrist, and up past the neck to a kind of head-covering like a cowl, over which he wore a pointed helmet of rough metal. Outside the armor he wore a very short leather vest caught with a belt from which hung a short sword, and across the shoulders just below the neck another belt with a buckle at the left, where the halberd could be secured and balanced.

He passed from the front of the church to the south side, looked about carefully to see if there were any signs of life in the street or square, and finding none, turned away from the church and entered the churchyard at the south, where the moonlight fell brightly upon the old gravestones. Squatting down behind one of these and crossing himself as if in excuse to the people buried there for disturbing their slumbers, he laid his halberd on the ground at his right side and the lantern at the left. Then, reaching into a wallet which he wore at his girdle, he took out a crust of bread and a huge portion of meat. These he began to eat with no suspicion of any interruption.

In this conduct he was justified, for he had been doing this samething over and over again for many years; there had been no serious duties about the church save perhaps on a holy day when youth on mischief bound would play some trick upon the watchman, and them he could easily dispatch about their business. Thieves seldom troubled churches in this period, and the cemetery itself was guard enough against marauders in a period full of superstition. Up above him the trumpeter kept a much stricter vigil, and all about the town, the watch tried house doors and questioned late passers-by.

"Oh-ho-hum!" he yawned. Such a quiet thing was life!

But—flattened against the church wall behind him was one whose intention might have disturbed those weary thoughts had the watchman been able to discern it. The Snake had sized up this situation with rapidity and had taken advantage of the moment that the watchman turned his back upon the square to dart into the projecting shadow of a buttress. Edging along the wall, he moved cautiously until he was but a few yards from the tombstone by which the watchman sat.

Plof! The Snake had pounced like a hawk on a mouse.

There was not even a scuffle, so prepared was the intruder and so taken by surprise was the victim. Down went the watchman on his back by the side of the grave, and in a second the deft Michael had bound his scarf tightly about the man's mouth, so that he could not utter a sound. It was the work of a moment as well, to secure the hands and feet with short bits of rope that he carried in his jacket— he was at first minded to cut the man's throat with his own sword, but he feared lest he might make one last dying cry and upset all their plans.

Inside the victim's leather vest he found a huge brass key. Thishe cut loose from the short chain, which held it, and thrust it into his own belt.

Then, making sure that the bonds were secure, he leaped back into the shadow of the church and stole back to the wagon of his chief as deftly as he had come.

"I have bound and gagged the watchman behind yon gravestone," he reported, "and here is the key to the tower door."

A whispered command traveled along the line of carts. Then there was a general doffing of blankets and turbans, and the band of Peter, in leather jackets and hats, high hose and tall soft boots, stood ready behind their carts to follow the leader into his excellently planned enterprise.

It was but a short distance from the carts to the tower, and Peter led the way, keeping close to the ground in the shadow cast by the tower. They stood at length, about twenty of them, within the shelter of the angle which the tower made with the church.

"Keep close behind me," said the leader, "when we mount the steps, and watch lest there be loose boards in the stairs beneath your feet. The boy is here this night in the tower with his father. Mount carefully, but rush and secure both father and son when I give you word."

Here he fitted the key, which Michael had stolen from the watchman, to the lock and swung the small iron door on its hinges. He had to stoop as he went in.

"Quiet," he whispered, "follow closely."

In a very few minutes they were all inside. The last man, following directions, closed the iron door, so that if a curious passer-by should inspect it, he would find it shut as it was usually.

"The task is easy," whispered Peter when they had climbed the narrow steps that led to the stairs built in the tower scaffolding, "we have now but to bag our rabbit. But you must see to it that he is not a noisy rabbit. If he once gets his hand on a bell rope, he will awaken the whole town with his ringing. He must be secured quickly."

They went up and up, mounting quietly the stairs that wound about the heavy scaffolding, and treading ever carefully so that not a single board should squeak. At last the leader stopped.

"The light is just ahead," he whispered.

Through the opened door of the tower room came suddenly the voice of Joseph, "You can sleep for the rest of the night, Father," he said. "I will sound the Heynal at every hour; the hourglass is plain to read, and I shall make no error."

It was lucky to hit upon a night when they were together, thought Peter. We can bind the old one and make the young one show us the way to the prize.

Joseph had just spread a manuscript before him on the table in the tower room and had moved a taper close to it to begin reading, when he heard a sudden noise just outside the door. Turning about sharply, he was just in time to see the door thrown violently open, and then three men rushed toward him before he could even assume a defensive attitude; he was absolutely powerless. One man held his arms as closely gripped as in a vise while the two others leaped upon Pan Andrew as he rose, dazed with astonishment, from the little bed.

A fourth man stood in the doorway. His hands were at his hips and he laughed merrily. "Ho—ho—my merry singing birds," he said. "We meet again high up above the noisy world, where none can come to disturb us." Then his brews darkened and he asked, "Doyou know why I am here?"

Joseph shuddered. This man was the same that had met his father on the first day that he had seen Krakow—this was the man that had incited the crowd in the Rynek to stone his people—this was the voice that he had heard while he lay bound hand and foot in the small room of his lodgings. But at the same time he wondered what had brought the man back to the city. He had already obtained the prize, Joseph thought, after the risk and danger of the first trial. Was it, perhaps, that he wished to avenge himself upon his father for the incident of the cart?

Joseph made a motion as if to cross himself at thought of this, for here they were high up in the air above the city, and nothing would be easier than to hurl a man from the summit into the graveyard below, and none would know of it until morning came and they found the lifeless victim.

Pan Andrew, however, looked at the intruder steadily. "No," he said, very deliberately, "I do not know why you are here. But I do know you now, Peter of the Button Face, sometimes called Bogdan—it is strange that I did not recognize you that morning when you threatened me."

Peter took notice in no way of Pan Andrew's latter statement. He heard only the negative answer. Apparently he had not expected it.

"You do not? You lie! ... Do you think that I do not know everything?" He pushed his way in and held the candle close to the prisoner's face. "I say to you that I have come all this way to get what I want; I have the means for doing it, too, and I have men in this company that would rather see a dog like you dead than alive.Now come—if you value your skin. Where have you hidden the Great Tarnov Crystal?"

Joseph leaped with a thrill. This, then, was the prize that they had brought from the Ukraine—a crystal, the "Great Tarnov Crystal," whose loss the father had not ceased to mourn. But, after all, was a crystal something that men valued so highly? If it were a diamond or a precious stone, there might be some reason for so much covetousness, but a mere crystal—why, he himself knew caves in the Ukraine where one might knock rock crystals from the walls. But perhaps this had a certain significance.

"You know as well as I," returned Pan Andrew, "that it disappeared on that same night that you attacked my lodgings. If you have it not, I know not where it is to be found."

"It disappeared!" Peter was at first shocked, then incredulous. "You lie!" he shrieked, "you lie! You have it still. I will find a way.... Come here!" he called to Michael the Snake, "take this boy to the house where he lives, and keep always your knife at his throat. I will stay with the old one here, and if you do not return in a quarter of an hour, we will put this Pole out of all trouble in this world.... No," he continued, as if changing his mind, "I will go with the brat myself. While we look the house over, you keep your sword close to the old fox's throat. If the boy leads me the wrong way, I'll slit his throat, likewise if he tries to betray me. But if we do not return with the crystal in a reasonable time, do as I have told you."

That Pan Andrew would gladly give up the crystal to save not only his own life but that of the boy, the Cossack had believed firmly. Therefore his denial of the possession of the crystal was unlooked for and baffling. However, he dismissed the matter fromhis mind promptly. Undoubtedly, Pan Andrew had lied to him, and unless something unforeseen happened, it would be but a matter of a few minutes' time before the crystal was in his own hands. It was true that Joseph might not know the exact hiding place of the crystal; what he did know was that the men in the tower would kill his father if he did not return at once with the prize, and he and the mother would make a quick search of the house in order to find it and redeem the father. It did occur to Peter that perhaps Pan Andrew had deposited it elsewhere, but if the house did not give up its prize, then they would return and try to torture the information out of the father.

"Stay," he said suddenly, just as Joseph's captor delivered the boy into his hands, "the hourglass there on the table shows that the sand has fallen to the second hour. It is time that the trumpet was sounded from this place otherwise someone may suspect that something is wrong and come up here to see.... You, boy—you trumpet sometimes, I know. Surprises you, does it? Peter has eyes and ears everywhere. So, before we set out to get this precious stone, take down that trumpet from the wall.... No, leave it there a moment, and come here."

He led him to the bell rope outside and stood over him.

"Ring twice upon the bell; then get your trumpet and play your Heynal from the four windows."

He watched the boy carefully, with his knife gleaming in his hands, as Joseph tugged twice at the cord that moved the hammer against the bell.

"Do as you always do, and play no tricks."

As Joseph went back to the little room and took up the trumpet,he was thinking of another young trumpeter who, standing in the old tower over this same spot, had fallen pierced by an arrow while performing his duty. And it seemed curious that he too was called upon to show his mettle in much the same way. In his heart much of the first tumult of fear had died out. There had come to him that gift of everlasting staunchness which had been one of the most characteristic qualities of the Polish people. It was perhaps the inspiration which the thought of that other trumpeter had brought, for immediately afterward and at the minute that he had thrust the trumpet through the tower opening on the west, his mind flew back to his conversation one day with Elzbietka. He had spoken in jest that day about the Heynal, but she had taken it as a childish secret— bless her!—he was sure that she would remember.

This hope increased instantly. He knew that Elzbietka was awake at the second hour; she had known that it would be at that hour that he would take his father's place, and if the Heynal was played straight through and two or three notes were added at the end where usually the music broke off on the broken note, she would know that something was wrong. What would she do? Her uncle, lost in his experiments, would only laugh at her fancy, as he would call it. Would she dare in the night to go to Jan Kanty? If she did, it was possible that Kanty could summon the watch quickly enough to save his father's life, for he felt in his heart that Peter meant to kill Pan Andrew after the crystal was found.

It all depended on this. Did Peter know the story of the Tartar invasion and the broken note at the end of the Heynal? God must be trusted that he did not. This prayer was on Joseph's lips as Peter said, "Now for your music."

Up went the trumpet.

Then it seemed to Joseph that he had once done this very thing before. The whole world changed beneath him. The great stone city had become wood, and it was everywhere in flames. Men of short stature and ugly faces were riding about furiously on little horses. Close at hand a man had descended from his horse and had drawn a bow from his shoulders and an iron-tipped arrow from a quiver. The bow bent, the arrow was notched.

He played.

Peter nodded. The Heynal was not new to him, and he knew that the boy was playing as usual—that is, he knew up to a certain point. Joseph hesitated at the place where the music ordinarily breaks off— this time he added three notes of his own, which definitely finished the Heynal. It took courage to play those notes, for he knew not but that at any moment he might feel the Cossack's dagger in his throat. At length, he let the trumpet fall and looked about.

The blood surged into his head with a rush. The Cossack was nodding approval! He did not know, then!

He went to the windows at south, east, and north successively and played as he had already played.

"Now hurry for your lodgings!"

Peter gripped the boy's arm and pushed him ahead all the way down the stairs, after giving final orders to the men who guarded Pan Andrew. They found no one in the square below and slunk along in the shadows toward the university district. The Cossack was exulting again that his plans were working, and as he went along he looked about him for a quiet corner where he could finish Joseph with his dagger once he had the crystal in his hands and was on the way backto the tower. Then they would settle with the father and there would be no one left to give information concerning them. A company of Armenian merchants would leave the city unhindered in the course of the following day.





XII. ELZBIETKA MISSES THE BROKEN NOTE


Very much earlier on this same eventful night a girlish figure emerged from the door leading to Alchemist Kreutz's lodgings, on the third floor of the building where Pan Andrew lived, and stole quietly down the steps to the second floor. Here she rapped three times. In a space of perhaps a minute, the door was thrown back a little, and Joseph's mother peered cautiously out through the crack.

"Come in, child," she said heartily as she recognized Elzbietka's face.

"What brings you out so late?" she inquired a moment later, as she shot the heavy bolts back into place and secured the door. "Has the student Tring been troubling you or your uncle lately, or what is it? Sit there at the table where I was just finishing my sewing for the day and tell me the whole story."

"Yes," answered the girl, "it is the student Tring. He and uncle are in the loft now, and I am somewhat frightened—they have been talking more queerly than ever all this evening."

"You must stay with me here this night," the woman said. "It's a shame that such a scholar as your uncle should have anything to do with that student, Tring. I fear that young man very much. He seems to me like one who has grown old and then become young again. When he looks at me with those great dark eyes it seems as if he were thinking of terrible things—"

"I will stay here, and gladly, Mother," she answered, for in these months of sweet acquaintanceship the affection of the woman and girl had become much like that which exists between mother and daughter, "but it is not that I fear anything, myself, from the student Tring. It is really my uncle's conduct these few weeks that troubles me, and more especially his conduct since that night when the men came here to steal. He is so changed!"

"I have seen," Joseph's mother replied. "But has he ever been cruel to you?"

"Oh, no! Never that. But he is not at all as he was when we first came here to live. Then he was full of merriment, ready to talk or laugh with me, eager to go somewhere or to see something that would be of pleasure to us both. Now he does not seem to think of me at all. He is always like one in a dream. Sometimes when I speak to him he does not seem to hear. Other times he answers my questions queerly, saying things that I had not thought of. He is caught up in something that I fear, and something that has little good in it."

"It's the student Tring who has done all this."

"Yes, I think that he has done much of it. They two are together every night, and they work together in the loft above my head. I can hear them moving about occasionally, though sometimes a terrible silence is all that there is."

"My dear child," the woman laid her work by for the moment, "this is always your home here. Come here when there is anything to trouble you.... The little bed is always yours.... We, too, are greatly troubled as well, as perhaps you know. Pan Andrew has not been the same since that accursed night.... Yet if one had but sense, we havehere all that should make man happy: children, love, bread, and a house—why must men be always sighing and striving for that which they have not?"

"We were so happy before," continued Elzbietka. "It seems to me that the student Trine, has some charm over my uncle which he cannot resist."

"Heaven help us," exclaimed the woman, making the sign of the cross. "And have you any idea what is going on in the loft above you?"

"None." The girl shuddered. "It is some terrible thing. Tonight both men spoke in such a peculiar way that I was frightened when they first came together. And ever since that they have been speaking more wildly, I think, than ever before. My uncle keeps saying, 'this will drive me mad,' and Tring says to him again, 'there is nothing of harm in it. Try once more.' Then again there is silence and my uncle speaks shortly, mad things—and I was frightened and came here."

"My poor child."

"Just before I came downstairs Tring was speaking to my uncle as if he were a common servant. And my uncle instead of being angry seemed to be trying to please the student. At last Tring said: 'This, now, you must do. You must learn the secret which will change brass into gold. Once you have gold, then you have the power to do all that man can do. You can go about over the earth and see all that there is to see, you can study with the most famous masters and buy all that you please.' He repeated over and over again the word 'gold,' and it seemed to me that while he was speaking my uncle was working at something, for he never answered a word."

The woman shook her head. "I have known of those who soughtto make gold out of baser metal. But no good ever befell them..." Then thinking that she needed to draw the girl's thoughts away from herself and her troubles, she said, "I am often lonely these nights when Joseph and his father are away. Yet I often listen for the sound of the trumpet in the church tower and I know that everything is well with them."

"And I. Joseph begins at the second hour. We have a secret, he and I, and I always listen for him to play."

"Bless your heart. Do you mean to say that you lie awake until the second hour?"

"I do when he is playing. For he is my best friend, and one should be loyal unto friends."

"Can you tell when he is playing, and when the father?"

"I could easily at first. Now it is much harder, but I think that I could distinguish did I not know at what hours each played. His notes are not quite so pointed as the father's, but they are becoming more and more like them all the time."

The conversation ran to other matters, and it grew late. Finally, the woman made up a bed for the girl on a small couch which Joseph and his father had built. It was close to the outer door, and directly below the casement, over which a piece of tapestry hung; the window was open in this fair weather, and Elzbietka could easily hear noises from outside, especially the sound of the church bells and the trumpet, for the window faced in the direction of the tower. Joseph's mother retired to the second room, where she slept when Joseph was at the church, and Elzbietka, without undressing, for she feared lest the alchemist should call her suddenly, threw herself on the couch and tried to sleep.

She found sleep impossible. Visions of some terrible thing happening to her uncle and the student kept her thoughts boiling like water in a kettle. She kept remembering the words that other people had said, the remarks made by other students, the whispers up and down the lane that Pan Kreutz was engaged in some terrible work of black magic.

It was a superstitious age, an age when people believed that powers of evil could be called upon, like human beings, to perform certain dark deeds—that souls of the dead forever haunted certain lonely places on earth and would answer a question if one but knew how to address them. If a black cat crossed one's path, then bad luck was sure to follow; if an owl hooted at exactly midnight from the tower of some deserted church, then the witches were riding through the air on brooms or branches; if a dog howled in the night, it was a sign that someone living near by was about to die.

There were people who fostered such ideas for their own benefit. They were for the most part necromancers or magicians who took the gold of credulous ones for telling them of their own futures or for warding off some impending evil from them. Perhaps some few of these believed themselves honest; the greater number were thoroughly dishonest and unscrupulous, men who wore dark robes and practiced dark ways simply to frighten superstitious folk into giving them money. These magicians sold articles, called "tokens," which were guaranteed to keep away certain evils. A little ball of black stone would prevent the possessor from being bitten by snakes. The little yellow, glasslike substance created when lightning struck in sand and melted the fine particles was greatly valued; crumbled and taken internally, it would prevent stomach trouble. Worn aboutthe neck in a small bag, it would keep off lightning. Certain little bones from the bodies of cats, dogs, and hares had properties of benefit; the heart of a frog had many mystic qualities.

It was quite apparent in the case of the alchemist Kreutz that something was going on that was undermining his health and perhaps his reason. Such a change as had come over him was not at all normal in a man with such a strong body and mind as he possessed. And as Elzbietka lay awake thinking of one thing after another, she became a prey to many strange fears, among them this one: that Kreutz was no longer the master of his own soul, that somehow the student Tring had become the master of it, that Tring had discovered something in his studies which he was working out at the expense of the man who naturally should have been his teacher and master.

The trumpet had in the meanwhile sounded the first hour, but still she was not able to sleep. Her natural thoughts of her uncle and Tring were followed by a food of fanciful imaginings, and in them she saw the figures warped and distorted out of their natural proportions; persons who are sick and persons who carry troubles in their minds experience this frequently, at a time when the body is tired and aching for sleep and yet when the mind is overactive with worries. Her uncle, at one minute of normal and ordinary size, seemed at intervals to shrink or enlarge without warning; Tring was now a student of the collegiate type, now a nightmare of a thing with the head of a pumpkin that grew until the whole sky was filled with the darkness of his shadow. They were engaged in many nefarious enterprises: they were releasing great hordes of bats from baskets, bats that they had created out of old sandals; they were leapinginto the air and catching huge birds like eagles, which they were imprisoning under the roof of the loft; they were mixing fiery liquids that hissed and bubbled and foamed—they were doing a thousand things at once and all of them somehow of evil. For nearly an hour these phantoms of half sleep danced in her brain, and then suddenly the bell on the tower sounded twice.

"The second hour," she exclaimed, the drowsy phantoms of her brain taking sudden flight.

The Heynal began. That is Joseph, she thought.

She was humming the tune, already following him note by note—she reached the place where the hymn ended, and ceased there, to wait until he began to play again from the second of the four windows. But the next second she realized to her vast amazement that Joseph had not stopped upon the broken note that came at the end of the Heynal, but had added a note or two and brought the little hymn to an end in the way that pieces of music usually end.

Elzbietka sat upright on the bed, although she was quite certain that some trick had been played upon her by her senses. Perhaps I was but half awake, she thought. I will listen more closely when he plays it the second time.

He began to play from the south side. This time she did not hum the tune over, but followed each note intently. When he had finished she realized that for the second time he had not stopped upon the broken note, but had gone ahead with the additional notes which made the Heynal sound like a finished piece of music and not one that was broken off.





The ending of the Heynal, showing the broken note.





The Heynal as Joseph played it, showing the notes which he added.





"He is playing it wrongly," she repeated to herself.

He played next on the east side, but the wind carried the sound away this time. When he came to the last window, the window on the north, the sound came clearly to Elzbietka's ears. "This time I shall know," she said.

At first she thought that he was going to stop upon the broken note, for he hesitated there, but then he went on ahead, as if to say, "I know that I should stop here, but am not stopping," and added the extra notes which finished the strain, just as the young trumpeter would probably have finished it had he not been shot down by the Tartar bowman.

Elzbietka was off the bed and on her feet.... He had played it in such fashion deliberately! Joseph was far too good a trumpeter to make the same mistake at least three times.

But what—what—could it mean? That Joseph was in some trouble? But there was the great alarm bell, which once sounded would rouse the town in an incredibly short time. This bell was always employed in times of fire, invasion, defense, and such various events as riots, the visit of a foreign king, the declaration of war—

He certainly would not trifle with such a sacred thing as the Heynal for a mere pastime—therefore, why, why, why, did he not ring the bell?

There could be but one answer! The girl had half realized it with the very first false note of the first playing of the Heynal. This was a signal to her—to her, Elzbietka Kreutz! Joseph was in some strange, some unusual kind of distress! He counted upon her to remember the little secret that he had made in joking, he counted upon her to understand that he was in trouble. Why, perhaps he was even held by force—here her intuition actually leaped to the truth—perhaps some person was watching him so that he could not ring the bell!

Yes, it was for her ears that he was playing.

And she must act—she must help Joseph—at once—at once. Only, what was the wisest course? She could not bring herself to alarm the boy's mother—should she call her uncle? He was still with Johann Tring in the loft—the light was there and there had been no sound of the student descending. Both, she knew, would laugh at her fears and send her back to bed. Therefore she moved quietly from the couch across the floor to the door, where she threw back the bolts and drew the door open. Stepping across the threshold, she closed the door and ascended to her own lodging, where she procured the key to the outer door, and threw a cloak about her head and shoulders. In a very short time she was in the street.

At such an hour as this in the morning, it was dangerous for an unarmed man, and even more for an unarmed woman, to pass through the streets. Late roisterers were abroad, gamblers, drunkards, thieves, the very filth and scum of the city, were crouching in corners or picking the pockets of some man who had been struck down from behind. The city watch were preventive enough against crime if they responded in numbers large enough to cope with thieves and murderers who often worked in bands, but the law satisfied itselfwith treating most cruelly the few prisoners that fell into its clutches, and let the great majority of offenders go unmolested. Therefore a man's best friend in dark city streets, particularly at such a late hour as this, was his good sword or cudgel.

Once outside the building wall, Elzbietka breathed a prayer to her patron saint, the good Elizabeth, and observing in the bright light of the moon that the Street of the Pigeons was for the moment empty, kept her back close to the wall and edged her way slowly in the wall's shadow to the cross street at the left, through which she had planned to dart for St. Ann's Street, only a block distant. She was at the very corner and had climbed out from the sheltering buttress of the wall when there came the sound of men's voices from the Street of the Pigeons, directly behind her. Without turning about to see who was there, she darted around the corner into the cross street and broke into a run over its rough cobbles.

Someone, however, had seen her. She heard a voice cry, "Who is there?" and there was the sound of feet pursuing her.

"A woman, as I live," she heard a pursuer say as she dashed ahead. The moon seemed to hang over the very head of the cross street, so that none of the buildings threw a shadow. The pursuers had already turned the corner from the Street of the Pigeons and came flying ahead in great leaps and bounds.

She thought of Tartars and Peter of the Button Face, but it was no such folk as that who followed her. This small company of men was but a band of rags and tatters, beggars and petty thieves and filthy cozeners, seeking only to fleece some passer-by of a few grosz in order to get drinks or a hard corner in which to sleep. A girl of her age was just such prey as these wretched people sought, for theycould plunder her without fear of harm, and her clothing or perhaps some bundle that she carried would bring a few coins for their need.

"Stop! Stop! We are friends," the first of them called out. "We would not harm a woman in the street at such an hour. Listen, we will go with you where you are going." But the tone of the voice only made Elzbietka run the harder.

Into St. Ann's Street she turned at length, with the men close behind. Her one hope now was that Jan Kanty would answer his bell quickly, for if she did not slip inside almost immediately, the men following would catch up to her.

However, summons for help from Jan Kanty seldom waited long without an answer. He had been busy all that night with his writings, at which he worked incessantly, when he was not aiding some world-wrecked soul—writings which were to prove of inestimable value to the university and the whole world of culture after his death. Therefore the ringing of the bell took him but a few steps from his work. As he unlocked the door and flung it open, the girl darted by him and into the house.

"It is I, Elzbietka Kreutz," she said. "Good father, I come with news that needs action, I think, and that immediately. But first close the door, since there are some pursuing me."

The scholar closed the door. If he felt astonishment at the sight of a young girl flying through the streets at such an hour, he did not show it. He was, as a matter of fact, used to all kinds of strange happenings. Even when the wretched beggars raced past the door, wondering what had become of their victim, he had an impulse to go out and talk to them and eventually share his purse with them, since he knew that it was only poverty and starvation that drove them tosuch extremes. But recognizing the girl's distress and her immediate need for him, he closed the door and led the way into his study.

"What has happened, daughter? Has there been a robbery again in the house, or has thine uncle gotten himself into some difficulty? Something of the sort there is, I feel and know."

She recited her story as best she could, for she was short-breathed from running and from her anxiety for Joseph. If only he would not smile! If only he would not think that she had been dreaming! But the venerable scholar was far from smiling.

"You are right," he exclaimed spiritedly, almost before she had finished her tale. "There is no time to wait. He is in some grave danger, which may the good God divert from him. Remain here, where you will be safe. I will at once send a servant of the university to call the watch, and will go with them myself to the tower. I fear something of evil has happened."

A few minutes later, thirty men of the city watch, in heavy armor, were marching upon the church. They found first the church watchman securely bound in the churchyard and released him. Then they entered the tower through the unlocked door and began silently and cautiously to climb the stairs.

In the meantime the band of Cossacks high up in the tower above had begun to grow weary of this excursion. At first the idea of an attack in midair, and in a church tower at that, had piqued their curiosity and aroused their thirst for adventure, since such an attack had heretofore been entirely outside their experience. And when, earlier in the evening, Peter had called for the ten volunteers he needed, not one man among them could be induced to remain behind.

But the affair had proved to be of a simplicity that had no appeal for men so bloodthirsty. In truth, so well had Peter's plans been laid, and so secure from intrusion did they feel in this lofty stronghold, and so irksome was the waiting for their leader, that they had succumbed one by one to the drowsiness of the early morning hour, and with the exception of the one man who stood guard over the trumpeter, they were sprawled out idly, or were dozing.

Therefore, men of the city watch, when they had crept noiselessly to the top, surprised them completely. In truth, they were captives before they were quite on their guard or realized what was happening. Pan Andrew's guard himself did not have time to carry out the leader's command—he was, in fact, made prisoner as he was upon the point of delivering a death blow.

While they were binding the last prisoner's arms, Joseph came running and leaping up the steps and threw himself into his father's embrace.

"Father, Father," he shouted excitedly, "it was Elzbietka who did this." His eyes were shining as he thought about it. "Elzbietka-Elzbietka," he kept repeating. "She heard me sound the trumpet in a different fashion from the way I usually sound it, for tonight I did not stop the Heynal upon the broken note, but played several notes more. She ran through the night alone to Jan Kanty's and he aroused the city watch. I just met him at the foot of the stairs, and he told me the whole story."

"Bless the girl," said the father, tears rising to his eyes. "And you, my son, how did you get free? I feared—"

"The man who was dragging me toward our home heard the watch marching through the street, and when he realized that theywere going toward the church he took himself off like lightning into the darkness, without another thought for me. But Elzbietka is at the scholar's dwelling, in the university building, waiting. I must go to her quickly and tell her all, and thank her that we are alive this night."

Pan Andrew was busy with his own thoughts when the watch finally marched away with their prisoners.

The Great Tarnov Crystal! The Great Tarnov Crystal! That was what the Tartar said he had come for. Was it possible that the man had been telling the truth? For what other reason could he have surprised him thus in the tower? For what other reason the hurried expedition into the town with the boy, Joseph, and the instructions he had left with his men? If it had been revenge alone that the man was seeking, then he and Joseph would never have remained alive until now. But if the man had not obtained the crystal on the night of his attack upon his lodgings, then what in the name of heaven and earth had happened to it on that night, and where was the crystal now?





XIII. THE GREAT TARNOV CRYSTAL


It was late one evening in April, a few weeks after the unsuccessful attack of Peter upon the tower, that the alchemist Kreutz and the student Johann Tring were sitting upon rude stools in the loft above the alchemist's lodging, arguing with much heat some question that had arisen between them. The day had been sultry for early spring, and the sun was setting red over the distant hills, flooding with its crimson the high mound, called the Krakus Mound, over beyond the river on the road to Wieliczka and the salt mines.

Tring sat where he could see the sunshine through the little window, but the alchemist sat within the gathering darkness of the room. Above their heads on the slanting walls, vials and glass tubes of the alchemist's craft gleamed like precious stones, and every now and then some substance lying upon the hot coals of the braziers would hiss up into a little flame and smoke, for all the world like a serpent suddenly raising its slender head and coils above a quiet patch of grass.

"I tell you that I have had enough," the alchemist replied to some remark of the student's. "I am ready to forswear this scientific experiment into which we have so boldly launched and go back to my old studies, which are much better suited to a God-fearing man."

Tring laughed, low but maliciously. "So that is where your courage lies," he answered. "That is the crown of valor that youboast in exploring the wonders of the unknown world. Come," he added after a minute, as if changing his tactics in dealing with this man who was now thoroughly in his power, or so he thought, "come and put a better complexion upon things; we are already past the hardest stretch of the road—if there is to be found the solution to that problem upon which we both have spent so much time, it will be found so much the more readily now because of the sacrifices that we have already made for it. Are the trances tiring you beyond endurance?"

The alchemist let his head sink into his hands. "I am tired—I am tired," was all that he could say.

Tring regarded him with disgust, but held back the angry words, which sprang to his lips and expressed himself more gently.

"Then, if there is a fault, it must lie with you, Pan Kreutz," he said. "It is beyond my understanding that such a man as you should find exhaustion in these simple experiments that I have performed. Many another person I have put into trances similar to yours, and for longer periods of time, too, and there has been no harm, nay, nor physical exhaustion from it."

"Alas," the alchemist moaned as if making a confession, "I have been in trances other than those of your making, and almost continually, too."

"What?" Tring leaped to his feet in astonishment. "What do you say? You have been in trances induced by others? Other men share our secrets, then? Who may it be that is also a master of this rare craft? I had thought that no others, save I, in this town were able to bring about such trances." He glared at Kreutz with open hatred and let his fingers stray as well to the handle of a short knife that hecarried in his belt, for although he was but a young man, he took his occult powers very seriously. There was as well an element of fear in his emotions, since the civil authorities of that day dealt usually in short and severe fashion with persons brought before magistrates on the charge of indulging in dark or occult practices. Death even was prescribed as punishment for some, although disfiguring, whipping, stocks, and banishment were the most common penalties.

Tring's powers, though mysterious in those days, could be easily explained in ours. The so-called trances into which certain persons have the power to send others we call in these times merely hypnotic sleep. Hypnotism in the days when all men and women were to an extent superstitious was looked upon as one of the very worst works of a malignant devil upon earth. Tring possessed to some extent the ability to summon hypnotic sleep to a willing patient, and the alchemist had become a too willing patient in his endeavor to discover the secret that Tring had made appear so desirable.

And as is the case with most practitioners of hypnotism and their subjects, the hypnotist had gained, little by little, more and more power over his co-worker, until in a few months the alchemist had become merely a tool in the hands of Tring, who, knowing his ability and scholarly accomplishments, did not hesitate to use them for his own ends. He did this, however, with great caution, and enjoined ever upon the alchemist the need for the utmost secrecy, for if it had become known that such tricks were being practiced, the law would make short shrift of both.

"No man," answered the wretched alchemist, "no man, but perhaps—devils!"

"Devils?" Tring stood motionless, thunderstruck. Was the alchemist losing his mind?

"Yes, devils. I can stand it no longer." The alchemist rose from his stool and turned upon Tring. "You, who have powers greater than man, know most of what is passing in my soul. The secrets of my craft, the sciences of actions and reactions—all these you know. But I hold from you one secret, one great secret which has bowed my shoulders with care and blackened my heart with crime. Come, watch, I will show you something that has powers beyond those of which you dream. See...." His accents became wilder and his voice trembled. He shuffled about the attic as if making preparations for some experiment. He set up a tripod in the very middle of the room and linked the top with chains as if he were to set a bowl upon it; he unlocked a great chest that stood in one corner under the eaves and took from it some object wrapped in black cloth, and this object he placed upon the tripod.

"Now let us have a light," he said.

He shook some powder into a brazier full of coals, which suddenly leaped into flame. As the whole room burst into existence with the illumination, there appeared most prominently in it the tripod which bore the covered mystery. The alchemist whipped the cloth covering away. It was as if he had uncovered a diamond of the finest water! Upon the brass top of the tripod gleamed in that instant a very miracle of color and light; the object itself was about the size of a man's head. Upon this exquisite thing no artificial effort of man had been expended; it was as nature had fashioned it in the depths of some subterranean grotto where drops of water falling in steady succession for thousands and thousands of years had slowly createdit. The outer layers were clear like the water of a mountain spring; as the eye fell farther and farther within the surface, a bluish tint was perceptible, and at the very center there was a coloring of rose. Such was its absolute beauty that whoever looked into its depths seemed to be gazing into a sea without limit.

"In the name of Heaven," shrieked Tring, "what is this?"

The alchemist spoke in a low voice, as one might speak in a church: "The Great Tarnov Crystal."

"The Great Tarnov Crystal!" repeated Tring. "The Great Tarnov Crystal! ... Why, that is the stone for which alchemists and workers of magic have been searching these hundreds of years. The Great Tarnov Crystal!" He shouted it almost, in high excitement. "Why, man, we have here the greatest scientific treasure of all ages." He began to skip about in transports as the possibilities of the treasure's possession leaped into his mind. "And now I understand," he continued. "Indeed you have been under the hand of a devil if you have been gazing into that thing. Why, do you know that this stone can send a man into a trance in which all manner of truths will be divulged? Do you know that we can learn now for a certainty the very secret that we have been seeking?" And going close to the stone, he gazed into its depth as a thirsty man might gaze into a well of water.

There was this curious property of the Great Tarnov Crystal, and perhaps of all great crystals in the world's history, that it never presented the same vista twice to the man who looked within its depths. Now, this may have been due to many things, to the fact that the lights surrounding it were never twice the same, and also perhaps to this: that the crystal had the strange property of reflecting back tothe observer the very thoughts that were tucked away deeply in his head. What drew men to the Tarnov Crystal in the beginning was, of course, its beauty, its color, its light, its constantly changing vistas, and besides these, there was that indefinable fascination that all such stones have. Diamonds, as well, possess this fascinating power to a high degree, though the diamond is, of course, a small stone, and not large enough to hold the concentrated focus of two eyes for a very long time; the crystal by reason of its size possesses this quality according to its fineness.

The Tarnov Crystal was the finest crystal known to the magicians of the Middle Ages. And although magic was frowned upon by scholars and men of science, such as astronomers and alchemists, still there was no distinct line between science and magic, with the result that many of these men found themselves practicing magic when they had intended only to make scientific investigations. It was even so with Pan Kreutz, who ordinarily had but little use for magic or the black arts in any form—until now he had come entirely under the domination of the student Tring, whose enthusiasm had carried him away.

"I tell you that I have had enough," the alchemist repeated now. "I have perjured my soul to obtain this stone, and I am ready to return it to its rightful owners. This stone is a thing of wickedness and blood and it has a woeful history, as old perhaps as the world itself."

"Return it!" shouted Tring. "Return it! Why, Pan Kreutz, listen to my reasoning. I know not how you have come by this thing—I do not ask at present—but you would be scarce the man I took you for did you not use it for the purpose that we need it. After that we mayreturn it—if indeed it has been stolen—or if it sticks within your conscience to retain it now, then perhaps I—"

"Nay, nay, Johann Tring," exclaimed the alchemist emphatically, "to its rightful owners it shall go. Here I have kept the secret to myself, knowing that the knowledge would tempt you—and indeed you would not have known now unless the secret had burned so heavily in my brain."

"As you will," said Tring, humoring the alchemist with his concession, though the purpose in his eyes was of different intent, "but first let us learn from it at once how to transmute baser metals into gold; this I am sure we shall do, then we can be independent of these smirking dogs who rule the universities."

"Then let our experiments be brief," said the alchemist. "I have looked too long upon this glittering thing."

"You should have told me before." Tring again adopted the attitude of a kindly adviser.

"But, in truth," went on the alchemist, "I doubt if we can wring that secret from the crystal. I have now an opinion, though perhaps a wrong one, that the crystal only gives us back our own thoughts. We may not call upon it as upon some friendly spirit to tell us what we do not know—we may not wish and have our wishes fulfilled. I began to doubt it all." Here he rose to his feet and began to stride about the door. "It is already having a bad influence upon me. I cannot see straightly in the world of men as once I did. When I have looked into it for minutes and minutes my thoughts come back to me crookedly, and while I have taken much interest in such contemplation, I find that there is too deadly a fascination in gazing into those crystal depths. I have, as I said, found much of interest,and were I alone in the world, I might even pursue these studies to the very limits of human thought, but I sometimes feel as if my very soul were getting caught in the rays of that bright thing."

"Might I ask," inquired Tring, unable to restrain his curiosity longer, "how the crystal came into your possession?"

"It was like this"—the alchemist willingly relieved his mind of the secret that he had been bearing alone. "That night when the thieves came here some time ago I entertained them for a bit with some Greek fire and niter."

"Yes?"

"It seems that the crystal was at that time in the possession of the family in the rooms below ours."

"What! Tile trumpeter and the boy who bear the name Kovalski?"

"Yes, though that is not their name. They are Charnetskis and lived formerly ill the Ukraine."

"I see—and the thieves? Tartars and Cossacks who followed them perhaps from the Dnieper country?"

"Yes, the crystal was actually in the hands of the leader when I surprised him with an explosive powder. In the surprise and pain occasioned by my attack he dropped the crystal—the powder blazed about his face and burned his hair—the crystal rolled upon the floor, and I pounced upon it."

"But how had it come into the possession of the Charnetski family?" asked Tring eagerly.

"It was in this fashion. When the Tartars devastated the Polish country in the thirteenth century the village that stood where now is Tarnov was inhabited by the Charnetskis, among others, of course.It was Andrew Charnetski of that day who performed heroic feats in the defense of the city against the Tartars, and to him was presented for safekeeping the great crystal which has come to be known as the Great Tarnov Crystal. It was the chief ornament of the old town, and even kings had come there to see it. For, besides its qualities as a thing of rare value and beauty, it had those reputed properties you have mentioned: that a man who looked into it might there read the secrets of the past and the future; that he might find out the intimate thoughts of other men and women; that he might learn to overcome the elements, to fly through the air like a bird, to walk invisibly, to transmute base metals into gold. In those times no man was allowed to look more than three minutes upon it, for even in three minutes a man might find his head swimming and curious thoughts coming into his brain."

"But how did the Charnetskis save it from the Tartars?"

"They fled with it to the Carpathian Mountains and remained there until Batu the Tartar was forced to return to the land of the Golden Horde. Then, as it passed from eldest son to eldest son, it went to an ancestor of this Andrew Charnetski who settled in the Ukraine after the country had been put under Polish dominion in the days of Vladislas Jagiello. Of course the name Andrew Charnetski is by no means an uncommon one throughout Poland, so little did I think when this man came into the humble lodgings below that he belonged to the Charnetski family which had possession of the Tarnov Crystal."

"Did he tell you his story?"

"Yes. On the day after the crystal disappeared, he made a confidant of me, as one already acquainted with his name and a partof his history."

"But you had heard of the crystal before?"

"What alchemist has not?" he answered. "I knew that it was brought in early days to Egypt from somewhere in the East, and there it stood in a temple for many centuries. When the Romans conquered Egypt, the crystal was taken to Rome. During the years when the Romans were colonizing the lands around the Black Sea a certain Roman officer fell in love with a woman of Transylvania, and being sent there with a legion, stole for her this crystal from a temple in Rome. When his crime was discovered, the emperor sent a detachment of soldiers to bring him back, but he fled to the district which is now Halicz, but which went then under the Roman name Galicia. There he lived with his wife under an assumed name, in a remote village later known as Tarnov, and there the crystal remained up to the time that it passed into the hands of the Charnetskis. Around it grew up a sect of sorcerers, magicians, practicers of the black art, astrologers, and alchemists—some sincere, others mere charlatans."

"Surely there have been many attempts to steal the crystal from the Charnetskis?"

"Only one. It seems that men, even alchemists and astrologers, lost for a time the thread of its history, and it was only when a runaway servant of Andrew Charnetski spread the news in the East that it was in his possession that an attempt was made to find it. That attempt, as you know, cost Pan Andrew his house and property in the Ukraine. Who it is that is inciting these robbers I know not, but I have no doubt that the leader of the band was in the pay of some person in high authority."

"Would the robbers taken prisoners say nothing?"

"No, they did not know all, I believe. And like most Tartars they would rather die than betray a secret. Torture could not wring it out of them."

"Does Pan Andrew suspect that you have the crystal?"

"Pan Andrew considers me his friend. And at heart I am ashamed and sick that I have not restored it before now."

"But think. If it had not been for you, the Cossack would have escaped with the crystal and it would have been lost forever."

"I know it. Yet that is no justification for me. I stole it if a thief ever stole anything. When I first saw it that night on the floor of Pan Andrew's lodging I would have exchanged my chance of Heaven for its possession. When I had obtained it, and the attention of the crowd in the court below was turned to the robbers and to the man escaping over the roofs, I brought it here to the loft, under my coat."

"You did well," said Tring, the wildest impulses of excitement leaping within him. "Look—look at the crystal. It glows and dances and quivers like a thing alive, ready to tell its secrets. Quick, draw your chair near to it as you used to draw your chair to me when I was the master of your trances. Gaze deeply into it"—he fixed the hesitating alchemist with his eyes as a serpent might fix a helpless bird—"and now let us try the greatest experiment of all."

The alchemist pulled his chair close to the crystal as he was bid, and fixed his eyes upon it. Tring watched him closely from a distance. One minute—two minutes—three—the alchemist still looked at the crystal and Tring regarded him as a cat might regard a mouse that it was playing with. Four minutes—five. The alchemist still sat motionless, but his posture in the chair was changingslightly. His arms and neck seemed to be stiffening, his face was taking on the look of an entirely different person; his breath came regularly, but in longer and deeper draughts than was his wont. His eyes became wide open and staring.

"Listen." Tring's tone was sharp, commanding.

"I am listening," the reply came instantly.

Tring trembled with excitement. Not only had the alchemist gone into this trance more quickly than he, Tring, had ever been able to send him, but he was still responsive to the student, who had feared lest the agency of the crystal might render Kreutz unresponsive to him. But Tring had sent him into trances so many times that now his mind seemed to answer the student's bidding automatically.

"Tell me what you see."

"I can see a huge hall like an alchemist's room, filled with braziers and glass instruments. In these instruments fluids of fire are rushing to and fro, and near them are great copper kettles out of which are coming puffs of steam."

"It is the devil's workshop that you are in," said Tring sharply. "Do you see any men at work?"

There was silence a moment as the alchemist's consciousness went roaming through the vast room.

"There is no one here," he said at length.

"Are there any manuscripts there?" demanded Tring.

Silence again. Then—"Yes, on the wall hangs a parchment."

"Take it down."

"It burns my hands."

"Pay no heed to that. Your reward will be greater than yourpains."

"It is in my hands."

Tring glanced involuntarily at the hands of the man in the trance. Curiously enough, they seemed to be turning red, as if exposed to a great heat. "Now read what the parchment says."

The alchemist replied slowly, as if reading, and he spoke in the Latin tongue. "HERE MAY ONE FIND THINGS WHICH BE NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL BUT WHICH ARE SOUGHT OF ALL MEN."

"Good! Now unroll the parchment."

There was another silence. At length the alchemist said, "I have found somewhat."

"Read!"

"Nay, I may not. It is in symbols."

"Then write."

Tring deftly slipped a piece of board across his knees and put into his fingers a kind of pen made of wood and a feather; this he had dipped into a pot of ink as thick as paint, and he guided it in the alchemist's hand until it rested upon a piece of fresh white parchment that he laid upon the board.

The alchemist wrote as follows:

"Per Fit Lapis Philosophorum"[1]

"What else?"

The alchemist wrote:

"Quod primum incredibile, non continuo falsum est; crebo siquidem faciem mendacii veritas retinet."[2]

"No. That's nothing. Do you find other formulae?"

The alchemist looked closely and recited as if reading:

"Thus saith Olimpiodorus of Thebes, Osthanes the Egyptian, Psellos of Byzantium, and Giabr of Arabia: heat the fires upon thy brazier and place thereon a vessel full of yellow sulphur; this thou shalt melt until it gives forth a spirit; when the spirit is departed pour slowly upon the sulphur that quicksilver which has its birth in the planet Mercury. In but the twinkling of an eye this will be reduced from its natural state unto a state that is of the earth, black, without life, dead. Then take this lifeless substance and put it in a closed vessel; heat it and it will suddenly take on life again and become a brilliant red."

"Write it, write it," exclaimed Tring. The alchemist wrote. "And is there more?"

"Much. It saith here that this is the secret of the Seven Golden Chapters, of the Emerald Table, and the Pimander. Natura naturam superat; deinde vero natura naturae congaudet; tandem natura naturam continet."[3]

"No more of that. That is vile philosophy," shouted Tring. "Find and write the completion of the Philosophers' Stone, by which we may convert brass into gold."

The alchemist continued:

"Zosimus the Theban directs that this is the true method of turning brass into gold: To the above heated solution of sulphur and mercury add that pure niter which men find in the heart of India. Into this cast brass, and it will in a moment change to gold."

"Quick, to work. Light the braziers and bring out sulphur, quicksilver, and brass," commanded Tring. "Have you any of this Indian niter?"

"I have—a small packet on the third shelf of the closet," answered the alchemist. Tring rushed to get it and set all the materials ready for the experiment. Truly and sincerely did he believe that the alchemist had hit upon the solution of the much desired process of changing base metals into gold, and his own lack of knowledge in the realm of the science of alchemy was responsible for the ignorance with which he ordered the alchemist to compound one of the most dangerous chemicals known to man. The alchemist, on his part, was but acting under the hypnotic suggestion of Tring, and had no opportunity to interpose his normal-self sense between the student's intention and its execution. Indeed, the information he had during the trance came from his own fund of learning, although the suggestion of adding niter to the heated com-pound was but a fancy of a mind grown either tired or weak.

As the student hurried about arranging materials for the experiment, Kreutz sang a Latin hymn, which extols the practice of alchemy and the alchemist:





Inexhautum fert thesaurum

Qui de virgis fecit aurum

Gemmas de lapidibus.[4]





"Compound the Philosophers' Stone," commanded Tring.

The alchemist, still in the trance, arose, and leaned over the brazier. Something flaky and white and inflammable was tucked close to the bottom to act as kindling, and a coal brought from a farther brazier and laid upon this. It turned all black for a minute, then sizzled into an intense heat and ignited the brazier's contents. The flame was at first yellow and creeping, then it changed to blue and leaping. Kreutz put a vessel filled with sulphur into the flames, and sure enough, in a moment the spirit of the sulphur arose in fumes that filled the room.

Both leaned over the brazier eagerly as the alchemist shook mercury over the melted sulphur. As the parchment had decreed, so the reaction followed; in a short time the glittering mercury had mingled with the melted sulphur and become an ugly black substance. Tring handed to Kreutz another vessel, which was closed at the top. Kreutz shook the hot material from the first vessel into the second and put the latter back on the brazier. In all his motions he acted mechanically, as if he were but working out the will of another. He opened this second vessel after a few seconds, and sure enough, the black substance was becoming a lively red.

"The niter, the niter," exclaimed Tring eagerly at his elbow.

The alchemist took the package from his hands and tossed it into the substance now seething with heat. As he did so, as if obeying some unconscious instinct of self-preservation, he leaped back into the middle of the room and drew Tring with him. The exclamation of anger on Tring's lips was cut in half, for at that instant the loft of the house rocked in a terrific explosion!

"Quick, seize the crystal and descend!" screamed Tring, whowas already speeding through the doorway, frantically wiping sparks of fire from his clothing.

The exploding substances had sent their flames into the dry roof and walls of the house, and fire was leaping through them merrily. Everything in the room was beginning to blaze, and in two minutes more it would have been impossible to leave. The alchemist, still in a daze, took the crystal as he had been commanded, and made for the stairway. The stone gleamed in his hands like a million diamonds, rubies, and emeralds where the flames fell upon it, and he clutched it with all the strength of his right hand as he clung to the stair rail with his left, now swaying out over the court like a drunken man, now regaining his hold and descending another stair. But the student had been more nimble, and by the time that the alchemist had descended to the third floor of the house, Johann was down the stairs and through the gate, calling with all his might for the watch to notify the water master that the house above him was in flames. No watch was in sight, and so he sought one at full speed, and while he was searching, Pan Kreutz had reached the open door and disappeared in the night, the Great Tarnov Crystal hidden under the folds of his black gown.

But behind him the flames had eaten through the roof of his house and had leaped to the adjoining house. In a few minutes they had bounded clear across an open court near by, and had laid hold of one of the pensions of the university. The wind, then veering, swept the flames in a seething mass in the direction of the great Rynek, and in less than fifteen minutes after the flight of the two men from the loft of the building, the university section of Krakow was in the grip of a terrible configuration that threatened to devour the whole city.

XIV. A GREAT FIRE RAGES


Since earliest times Krakow was divided into four sections—the Castle Quarter, the Potters' Quarter, the Butchers' Quarter, and the Slavkov. At the head of each of these districts was a quartermaster, who was responsible for everything that went on in his district, the fighting of fires being one of his chief concerns. Therefore the watchman from one of the streets that lay in the districts threatened by the fire went pounding at the gate of the quartermaster's house, shouting "Fire" at the top of his lungs in order to send the servants flying to the master. In a short time the quartermaster was up and dressed and had sent summons to the water master, who had charge of the town reservoir and aqueducts.

The bell meanwhile began to sound clamorously from the tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary, for the watchman there had caught sight of the flames. Cries of "Fire" were now being echoed from all sections of the city, and in the red glare which was beginning—to illumine all the grim Gothic buildings and churches, a very tumult of confusion was arising. The water master had already set his machinery in motion, and drummers were pounding away at their drums in all the city streets in order to awaken the merchants and their apprentices, upon whom fell the burden of fighting the flames. All the town guilds were assembling, companies of servants from the palaces were filling buckets of water and taking positions on theroofs of their own houses, and all citizens were busily getting down from the wall, hooks and axes and pails such as the law required them to keep for such emergencies.

A fire of any size in Krakow was a serious thing in those days, for there were hundreds upon hundreds of wooden and part-wooden houses clustered together in the thickly populated streets. In the section about the old university the majority of dwellings were very ancient, dry, and cobwebbed everywhere, and a single spark upon their roofs was enough to turn them in exceedingly rapid fashion into belching furnaces of flame and smoke. As the fire raced through these streets, the inhabitants poured out in panic-stricken confusion; each building was literally teeming with life, and the whole scene, viewed from above, would have resembled a huge ant hill suddenly destroyed or burned out by a careful gardener.

Women and children came out rushing and shrieking. Black-robed students dashed through the streets with manuscripts and parchments in their hands; others came carrying glass tubes or astrolabes or metal dividers; frantic domestics ran here and there with no definite refuge in view save only to escape the heat and terror of the ever-spreading flames. The streets were rapidly filling with furniture, clothing, beds, and personal possessions of every variety, hurled out of casements by desperate owners—and some of this material in the streets had already caught fire from the sparks which were descending like rain in a spring thunderstorm, making the lot of the fugitives even more unendurable. Inside some of the courts those who had preserved presence of mind were combating the fire with much vigor; tubs of water and pails were being pressed into action, and burning walls were already being hauled down.

The water master had marshaled a line of water carts which extended from the burning buildings to the aqueduct; these water carts were usually drawn by horses, and some of them were on this night, but there had been difficulty in getting enough horses quickly, and men and boys were harnessed into the shafts. At the aqueduct, men were busy filling the carts with water; as each cart was filled it moved on some little distance to the fire, and there being emptied, swung about into another street and returned to the aqueduct for another filling. The nearest section of the aqueduct was about an eighth of a mile from the point where the fire started.

Forces of men armed with hooks and axes were sent out by the water master to surround the district where the flames were reaching, for the rapid spread of the fire had made it apparent at an early stage that very little could be saved in the university area. These men were under orders to demolish any building that seemed to offer a chance for a further spread of the blaze, whether the fire had already reached it or not. One detachment formed a line in front of the Church of the Franciscans, another on St. Ann's Street, and another on Bracka. All these detachments were forced to retreat, however, as the fire ate its way out of the district where it had started. The Rynek was the scene of a turbulent mob which had struggled from the burning section in the Street of the Pigeons, and every open space was quickly filled with rescued goods. Two families had even taken possession of the plat-form where the town pillory stood, and children were being put to sleep there by mothers thankful to find a place of rest.

Amid all this uproar, an elderly woman, a boy, a girl, and a dog were fighting their way through the Street of the Pigeons amidst the debris of furniture and personal belongings that had been thrownfrom windows. They had all been sleeping when the fire broke out, and not having been roused until the flames were all about them, had been able to rescue nothing but themselves and the clothes which they wore. The boy was Joseph, the girl, Elzbietka, and the woman the wife of Pan Andrew. Wolf, cut loose by Joseph, was the most terror-stricken of the group, but he followed after them, submissive and obedient, not knowing exactly what he was expected to do.

Each of them was busy with separate thoughts as they fought their way through the disorder. Joseph was ever figuring the quickest route out of the burning district, and this was no easy task, since the fire was playing so many tricks. It was not marching ahead in a straight wall of flame, but was whirling about, leaping here and there, skipping this house and fastening upon that, advancing, retreating, spreading to the flanks, all with terrific speed and unexpected vivacity. Sometimes the roofs just above the heads of the fugitives would shoot up in flames—passing these with great peril, they would find that the fire was now behind them and rejoice at the breath of air that fell upon them; then, suddenly, without warning the roof of a building just ahead would belch forth smoke and flame as if the fire demon were working invisibly, and this new peril must be passed.

At length they reached the place where the Street of the Pigeons is cut by a cross lane, known today as Wislna Street, but this lane was already full of smoking beams and fallen timbers; escape that way was impossible. There was nothing to do but to push on through the Street of the Pigeons where it curves to meet Bracka.

Elzbietka was wondering most of all about her uncle; there had been no answer to their hurried calls when they left the doomedhouse, and besides, the loft was glowing in red and purple flames of such intensity that no person alive could have been there at that time. Joseph's mother was thinking of the father, wondering if he had left his post at the church to come to his family's aid, and wondering, too, if they could reach him at the tower before he began to suffer too much from anxiety concerning them.

The houses were a little higher in this portion of the street, and there was therefore more cool air, in the lower reaches. The fire was still whirling along here, but was not taking hold quite so fast as it had done down below, and consequently the fugitives made better progress. The only difficulty was the ever-increasing crowd that now swept in from three directions, making it hard for the three to keep together. Finally, they locked arms and literally fought their way through the crowd. All about them the scenes were heartrending, men and women fleeing with but few possessions from the only homes they had ever known, children lost in the mad scramble who set up shrill cries and tried to keep their feet as the crowd pushed ahead. Sick persons were brought into that raging torrent of humanity, carried on the shoulders of their relatives or perhaps stretched upon cots. Here was one old man who sat astride a young fellow's neck like Anchises on the back of Aeneas, fleeing from the burning city of Ilium.

At length they stood where the fire had not reached, much more fortunate in that than many other people that night. Joseph waited only until they caught their breath, though he, too, felt like throwing himself down upon the ground and resting, and then started forward again through Bracka in the direction of the Rynek. In his heart he hoped that when he had settled Elzbietka and his mother in thetower where his father was on duty, he might come back with the apprentices and help fight the fire, for there is that in a youth which draws him into such fighting. As they went along Bracka he heard the sound of horses' hoofs from the direction of the Wawel.

"Wait," he said, drawing the women back on a footpath, "here come soldiers from the castle to preserve order."

He spoke truly, for the next moment a great troop of cavalry wearing mail armor and carrying spears rode into Bracka Street from below and began to deploy in lines that marked the district immediately threatened by fire. A few minutes later, foot soldiers and artisans began to appear, and joining with the watch, pulled down buildings at the edge of the fire. Siege machinery was also drawn up into Bracka, and the buildings just outside the reach of the fire began to crumble under its pounding.

This will prevent the spread of the flames, thought Joseph.

They went ahead again toward the church, but while they were still in the Rynek they saw a company of soldiers dragging forward a prisoner whom they had taken in the burning district.

"A thief," said the boy.

"Bless us," exclaimed the mother. "It is not possible that men could be so cruel as to steal from poor folk driven mad with terror."

As the company came near and the torches fell upon the face of the prisoner, Joseph let out a cry of amazement.

"Why, Mother, that is Peter of the Button Face, the leader of the men that attacked our house. That is the man who met us on the first day we were in Krakow. He it was who tried to make us prisoners in the church tower.... See how he struggles—but they are holding him tight for all that. And Mother, it is not the city watch that has takenhim. It is the king's own guard. Do you not see the royal crown on their helmets, do you not notice the richness of their clothing? I wonder what it can be about."

Joseph spoke truly. Peter had at last fallen into the hands of guardians of the law, and this time it was the king's own men that held him. It was evident, too, from the way they held him that they thought they had a prize. They did not stop at the Town House, where offenders against municipal law were kept, but marched straight along Castle Street in the direction of the royal castle on Wawel Hill.

At the church they found Pan Andrew in a very sweat of anxiety and fear lest something of harm had befallen them. He caressed them all one after another and then said to Joseph earnestly:

"I want you to remain here and sound the Heynals for the rest of the night. There is much work to be done in the quarter where the fire is, and every man's hand is needed to stay the flames.... I see that Pan Kreutz is not with you. He stayed, too, I presume, to work with the rest of the men?"

"Indeed, Father, I know not. We called many times, but his loft was a mass of flames like to a roaring furnace when we were driven down the stairs."

"I must see, then, if I can find aught of him. He has been on a previous occasion our very great benefactor, and it would but suit us ill not to seek at least his body in the ruins. Should he not have perished, as I pray God he has not, then we can offer him shelter here until such time as he can find a roof again."

But when Joseph told him of the capture of Peter, he looked very serious and said that if such people were in the city, then he had better not leave his wife and the young people. On second thought,however, it seemed right for him to go, for the city was now lighted by flames and it would be easy to summon aid if they were attacked.

And so he, with thousands of other valiant men, fought the fire in Krakow that night. They formed in a ring about the conflagration and tore down all the buildings across which it might run. The Collegium Minus was the last building to catch on the side toward the city wall, and then the fighters tore down the houses near the old Jew Gate and stopped the fire there. The flames swept around the other buildings of the university, destroyed one or two, though not all, and were finally halted on the second street above St. Ann's. Sweeping in the other direction, the fire had early in its progress destroyed the monastery and adjoining houses of the Church of the Franciscans, and had crossed over to Castle Street, where it burned flat a whole line of buildings.

On these and the other edges of the district a wide belt of destruction was created by the fighters. This belt the tradesmen, running to and fro with water wagons filled constantly at the aqueduct, wet down and soaked until it was almost a water wall. So furiously had they worked that the main progress of the fire was checked in seven or eight hours, and although certain buildings and ruins smoked and even blazed for several days afterward, yet the great danger passed when this well-soaked belt of destruction was completed.

When Pan Andrew returned to the tower in the full blaze of the morning sun, nearly one third of the city of Krakow lay in ruins. Fortunately, it was not the better portion of the city, and many of the old wooden-built hovels had been there since before the days of Kazimir the Great; that monarch had successfully converted about one half the city of Krakow from wood to stone more than onehundred years before; had he not done so, it is probable that the fire of 1462 might have utterly consumed it.

Elzbietka and Joseph's mother were asleep on the trumpeter's bed, clasped in each other's arms. Joseph sat outside the compartment with the hourglass before him on a beam, gazing out over the smoking ruins of the university quarter.

"Is the city saved?" was the first question he asked his father.

"It is not now in danger," answered Pan Andrew. "But there are many homeless souls in the city this day."

"Did you see the alchemist?"

"I did not. He has disappeared as if he had flown away on the clouds of smoke that covered the city."

"Poor Elzbietka," exclaimed Joseph.

The girl inside the compartment moaned slightly as her name was spoken, although she was deep in a heavy slumber.

"I wonder if he was caught in the loft?" mused Pan Andrew. "It was in the very center of the burned district."

The answer to his question came with sudden unexpectedness. There was a sound of footsteps on the stairs and Jan Kanty's head appeared from below. The scholar was leading another man by the arm, a man who had been in the fire—his charred clothes and blackened face showed it; around his shoulders and falling to his waist was all that remained of what had once been a black robe. He kept his hands beneath this robe.

"Pan Andrew," whispered Jan Kanty softly, "I have found in the street—Pan Kreutz." And, checking the other's startled exclamation, he explained, "He is not in his right senses. Something has affected his brain. But he has here something of interest to us all."

Pan Andrew turned toward Kreutz—he never would have recognized him had not Jan Kanty identified him; Joseph felt his eyes glued with strange eagerness upon the eerie blackened figure and the mysterious folded hands beneath the robe; it had been a scholar's robe once.

"Ha, ha, ha!" laughed the alchemist suddenly, "up to heaven goes everything in fire, and yet no gold is found anywhere. Johann Tring!" he looked about anxiously. "Where is Johann Tring? He answers me not. He is lost in the flames, the flames that came so red and purple when niter mixed with charcoal. Oho, Johann Tring! Come, Johann Tring, and see what I have carried this whole long night for you."

Throwing back the black robe, he held up the object that he had been concealing there, and at the same moment the sun, streaming in through the little window on the east side, fell full upon that object; fell upon it and made it sparkle like the myriad of dew diamonds shining upon a morning lawn newmowed; sparkled like the thousand chandeliers in the king's great hall in the palace on the Wawel Hill; sparkled like the rubies and emeralds that gleam in the queen's crown; sparkled like the wondrous thing that it was, all touched by the red rays of the morning sun—the Great Tarnov Crystal!

"Now whence has that come?" shouted Pan Andrew so loudly that the sleepers in the next room awoke. "Where, by all that is good and holy in the world, have you found the gem which has been in my family for years and years, which all my ancestors and I have sworn to guard forever and to surrender to no person except to the king of Poland? How has it come into your hands after it was stolen from me, and my heart was nearly broken? Did you get it perhapsfrom that ruffian who has been captured by the king's guards? Did you find it perhaps in the ruins of the town? Did you perchance—" The truth suddenly flashed upon him and he was speechless.

"It is an accursed thing," cried out the alchemist suddenly, reeling in Jan Kanty's arms as if he were gone faint. "There is blood upon it, and fire! It has lured princes and kings to their destruction! It has made men's brains mad with lust for want of it! It has caused good men to steal, and evil men to kill. I will have none of it. I will have none of it, I say." He was growing almost boisterous, yet there was something in this attack of madness that had much of reason and determination in it. "I will have no more of it," he repeated, "and no more of Johann Tring."

At that he fell fainting to the floor.

Jan Kanty raised him, and Elzbietka, who had run out from the trumpeter's room, rushed to him and kissed and fondled his blackened hands.

Pan Andrew picked up the Great Tarnov Crystal and held it at arm's length with a smile.

"Now may peace come upon us all," he said, "for I may fulfill the oath that my family has taken and deliver this to the king. While the secret of its hiding place remained with me, I might keep the crystal as long as I chose, but now that the secret is out, there is but one place where it may be guarded safely, and that is in the palace of the king. Pan Kreutz is right. This jewel has already done too much harm in the world."

"Then you may rid yourself of it at once," broke in Jan Kanty. "The king returned to Krakow two days ago, and we may find him at the castle this very morning."





XV. KING KAZIMIR JAGIELLO


Of all the wonders that the capital city of Poland possessed, Joseph knew of none that stirred his imagination more than did this royal castle of the kings upon the Wawel. Impregnable through many sieges its great rock base had stood, brick and stone heaped high above it in a great mass of towers, turrets, and walls. At its very heart, high above the winding Vistula and the town, stood a strangely built round tower, enclosed and protected by the palace wings, where men in prehistoric times worshiped the old nature gods of the Slavs; a place of rest and seclusion where on rare occasions, when townsfolk might visit the castle, Joseph had stood thinking of things that had been in the old days.

He knew well the legend of Krakus, the hero of the Dark Ages who slew a dragon that had once made this hill his habitation. There was a cave, so Joseph heard, that ran from the fortress underground beneath the river, a secret exit in time of siege; here had been the dragon's lair, until the hero overcame him, and from that day men made the Wawel a home from which might be seen climbing into the air spires and belfries. All this Joseph had seen; he had fed his fancies upon every object that graced the bleak, majestic rock, and yet there remained one glory that had never yet met his eyes. That glory was Poland's king.

But this morning, after the fire, when the little company set outfrom the Church of Our Lady Mary toward the Wawel Hill, Joseph felt his heart leaping strangely in his breast at the thought of the adventure that was to be theirs. To see the king, to have audience before him—it made the blood sing in his ears and tingle in his fingertips.

They took the alchemist with them, on Jan Kanty's advice, although he still seemed like a man in a dream.

"I found him wandering through the fire-swept streets early this morning," said the scholar. "He had been running hither and thither all night long in the most dangerous parts of the city, and how he has escaped death from falling timbers and burning coals is more than I know.... The man has something on his mind, something that troubles him hugely, and with it all, he seems to be acting like one in a spell."

"Do you think it well to bring him with us?" asked Pan Andrew, who had doubted from the beginning that there would be any benefit from the man's presence.

"Yes—I have a curious notion," answered the scholar, "that he may be able to help us. We have much to explain to the king, and the man's presence will make our story more credible. And who knows, perhaps the alchemist himself may get help—he needs some light thrown into that brain of his, and since he is harmless, it will do no damage to take him."

Pan Kreutz's hands and face had been washed and dried, and most of the fire grime had left him; the scholar's robe was useless, however, and Pan Andrew hung a kontusz, or long coat, about his shoulders.

Joseph was there with the three men; Wolf had been left behind,sleeping upon the floor of the high tower room. Joseph's mother and Elzbietka were under the protection of the day watchman who relieved Pan Andrew at dawn. It was necessary for Pan Andrew and Jan Kanty to assist the alchemist in walking at times, when his feet would shuffle curiously, like those of a man walking in his sleep, but he plodded along bravely, not yet realizing quite clearly what was happening about him, yet confident that the two men near him were his friends and were leading him to some good place.

From Castle Street they turned at length up the long slope leading to the castle on the Wawel. Behind them lay street after street of desolation, of smoking ruins, of masses of wood still flaming; amidst these ruins men were still working valorously, tearing down charred beams and hurling in tons and tons of water from the water wagons, which were now all drawn by horses. One side of Castle Street had suffered badly, the houses on the Street of the Pigeons were entirely destroyed, St. Ann's Street had but few buildings left, while much devastation had been done along the Street of the Bakers, the Street of the Goldsmiths, and the Street of the Jews and Broad Street.

Jan Kanty's company was challenged twice by guards on the way to the palace, but when the soldiers recognized the good father, they were at once passed along without question. It was another proof to Joseph of the esteem in which the man was held; in himself, however, there was not the least indication of pride and ostentation, he was as simple as a child in most matters affecting worldly things, and yet his name was as magic, even in the court of the king.

At length they all stood in the little passageway on the Wawel through which one passes to the palace, and here the guard, withspear raised in salute to the scholar, bade the company wait until he went to see if an audience might be had.

The soldier came back quickly. "The king," he said gravely, "will grant any request that may be made by Father Jan Kanty; he only begs that the company wait a few minutes, until a present audience is finished."

They waited perhaps fifteen minutes, until an important-looking functionary in a blue robe came to announce that King Kazimir Jagiello would receive Jan Kanty and his friends.

Out into a wide court they went, following the courtier in blue, up a marble staircase to the left, and along a balcony. Then suddenly a door was flung back and they were in the presence of the king.

To Joseph, remembering it afterward, it all seemed like a dream, it was all so quiet and without ceremony. King Kazimir had chosen to receive them in a small antechamber in which he often met certain persons who were to be received without the usual ceremony of presentation, and Jan Kanty was one of the privileged ones that he met in such fashion.

Joseph and his father dropped upon one knee in front of the king. He was sitting in a high-backed chair without a canopy, which bore at its highest peak a royal crown; this crown was just above the monarch's head, so that at first it seemed as if it were actually upon his head and he were crowned. He wore a huge purple robe which fell clear to the tops of his soft leather sandals; it had a great collar embroidered with silks of many colors and in many patterns; a heavy gold chain held the folds of the collar together, and beneath the collar folds, could be seen a rich vest embroidered with gold. The sleeves of the robe were immense and hung down far below hisknees as he sat there; the robe itself was fringed with heavy fur. His head covering was a simple cap of the same color as the robe, flat, soft, and turned up a trifle at each side.

The king himself seemed the picture of comfort and informality; not so his guards. On each side of him stood a guard in plate armor, with stiff metal pieces over the arms, stomach, thighs, and legs. At the waist they wore short, straight swords, ready for action at a second's notice. These two men were as motionless as statues. About the room stood knights in different kinds of armor, some in light chain with long skirt like coats, some in mail jackets that resembled checkerboards in pattern and extended only from shoulder to thigh, some in heavy armor and metal shoes armed with spurs.

In front of the king were two pages carrying scepters. They, too, stood motionless as he spoke.

"What is this?" he asked as Jan Kanty came forward to kiss his hand, which ceremony the king did not allow. "Have we here some poor city dwellers driven forth by last night's fire?"

"Yea," answered Jan Kanty, "that is true, though we come not on business of that sort. We are here upon some matter that may be of deeper interest than one would suppose. These are Pan Andrew and his son Joseph, by family name Charnetski, dwellers of the Ukraine driven forth by violence and come here to have audience with your Majesty."

"So," said the king with quick interest. "Stand, if you please, and tell me the circumstances of your trouble, for it greatly interests me at this present time. I have much news from the Ukraine, and not so pleasant, either. How came you by your misfortunes?"

"If your Majesty please," began Pan Andrew, rising and takingout the crystal from beneath his coat, "I wish to deliver to your Highness the Great Tarnov Crystal."

The sunlight touched it as he held it up, and the room and its splendid company were suddenly agleam with wavy flecks of light, red and orange and blue and yellow; there was a dazzling brilliance to it that struck each eye with almost the force of lightning. The king literally sprang forward to take the wondrous thing from Pan Andrew's hands.

"What a marvel! What a thing of beauty!" he exclaimed, while a very murmur of astonishment ran through the circle of his attendants. "Where in the world is to be found any jewel one-half so miraculous as this?"

"I know not," answered Pan Andrew, "but it has been in the keeping of my family for many years."

"Then why do you deliver it up to me?" demanded the king. "It is worth a quarter at least of all the treasures in this palace."

"That I will explain. My family has held it in trust these two hundred years and more, and we have sworn to guard it until the secret of its hiding place became known, and then, since there would be great danger following such a discovery, to deliver it into the hands of the king."

"Then its hiding place has been discovered? But tell me first the reason for concealing such a wondrous stone."

"That, your Majesty, is a long story, which if your Majesty so desires I will deliver shortly in writing, but I may say briefly that when Tarnov fell before the Tartars these many years ago, the citizens entrusted this crystal to a member of my family. He took oath to guard it zealously, with his life if need be, lest it fall into thehands of people who might abuse its powers, for its beauty hides strange properties which are allied to magic and sorcery and the black arts, and it has been at times a curse, a thing of mystery and a source of evil. When Tarnov was rebuilt, new dwellers came there and the crystal remained in our family."

"How did the secret become known?"

"I had a servant, a Tartar. He was with me for many years. It was my custom to conceal the crystal in the rind of a pumpkin, and many a time this man must have seen me scraping out the inside of a pumpkin and rubbing the shell with oils and gum in order to preserve it. Because he was a simple fellow, I took no pains at any time to conceal my task. But though lacking in wit, it seems that the man was not lacking in curiosity. And his curiosity, I now believe, led him to spy upon me, and eventually he discovered the use to which I put the preserved pumpkin rind. He left me about a year ago, and it was only a few months later that my house was attacked. I am sure that he sold his information to some Tartar chieftain."

"Could he suspect the value of the crystal?"

"That I do not know. I do know, however, that legends concerning this crystal are everywhere to be found among the Tartars and Cossacks. When they are children they are told tales of it, and all of them grow up in the hope that some day they may find it."

"Thou thing of beauty," said the king, gazing at the crystal, "could thou but speak and tell all that men have done to possess thee. Thou cruel, marvelous thing."

Pan Andrew fell upon his knees before the king. "Take this crystal and guard it, your Majesty," he exclaimed with great feeling,the tears already streaming down his face. "It has already done enough harm in the world. In my own family it has been nothing but a burden, a source of endless anxiety and suffering. My father's fathers, years and years ago, even dug a passageway in the earth, through which one might escape with it secretly in case of an attack, and so cleverly was this passage concealed that for years no one but the master of the family has known of its existence.

"In spite of the beauty of this jewel, I hate it from the very bottom of my heart, and I hope that I may never look upon it again. For every ray of light that it reflects, thousands of men have fought and died for its possession; for every color that lurks within its depths, miseries and sufferings have swept over whole nations. I have guarded it faithfully but no more shall I guard it. I am fulfilled of my oath."

The king looked into the crystal fixedly, and then suddenly shuddered, as if he saw something fearful there.

"I shall be before many years an old man," went on Pan Andrew, in a pleading tone. "My home in the Ukraine exists no more. My house is burned, my fields are laid waste, and all because I had this jewel in my possession and men envied me."

He then went on to tell the story of the escape from the Ukraine, the pursuit, the attempted robbery of his house, the attack on the tower, and the persistency and repeated appearances of Peter of the Button Face, whom he had heard of in the Ukraine as Bogdan the Terrible.

"I do not know," he said, "who it might be that sent this man to dog my steps, but my son, Joseph, has told me that your guards have taken this same Peter a prisoner in the streets, and that he is acaptive of your men. Let me confront him here, and perhaps I may learn who it was that drove me from the Ukraine."

While he was speaking, the king gradually took his thoughts from off the crystal, and when he mentioned the name Peter, the king grew restless with excitement.

"I have the man," he exclaimed, "and he shall be brought here. My spies in the Ukraine reported recently that a great treachery was afoot and that this man Peter, or Bogdan, was in Poland for the purpose of consummating it. His description was given to my guards, and a reward was offered. Last night he was seen in the district where the fire was raging, and my guards brought him in. I shall have him here directly."

Two spearmen brought him in; as he walked, the chains which hung from his arms and legs clanked on the door. He did not deign at first to glance at Pan Andrew or any of his party, but simply looked at the king and folded his arms defiantly and with spirit. Whereat the two guards forced him to his knees.

His air of indifference disappeared, however, when his eyes fell upon the Tarnov Crystal, which the king had set down upon the floor before him. He glanced left and right and favored the trumpeter and the alchemist with a look of bitter hatred.

"You are accused of treason against the Commonwealth of Poland," said the king immediately. "Have you any plea to make?"

"Who accuses me?"

"The governors of the Ukraine," answered the king. "And moreover you are charged with other crimes, among them that of persecuting this citizen here before me—you have destroyed his home and fields and attacked him while he was on duty in the churchtower. The penalty for any one of these is death."

Peter did not lose his self-assurance for a moment. He realized more quickly than another might that his plea of innocence would soon be broken down. He fell back then quickly upon another means of obtaining his end.

"I would buy my freedom," he asserted.

"What have you that is worth while to me?" asked the king.

"Much. You are threatened in the Ukraine."

The king thought for some minutes. It rather irked him to give this man his life, since he had already done such damage, hut on the other hand he might be able to obtain some really valuable information. The whole Ukraine was in some kind of uproar, and even his most trusted spies had not been able to get to the bottom of it. The usual method of obtaining information from prisoners in those days was torture, and in the field of battle it was employed widely, but often in cases of such desperate men as Peter torture led them to confess wildly but seldom with truth. The Cossack was ordinarily a man of his word, and Peter had enough Cossack blood in him to make him pass for a Cossack in the Ukraine and in the East.

"It pleases me to be merciful today," replied the king. "There has been too much suffering at my very gates to make me wish for more. Your death would in no way pay for your crimes, and it is possible that your information might be of service to the commonwealth. I could wrest this information from you by torture, but I prefer an easier way.... Now, mark," he cautioned the Cossack, "I know certain facts concerning what you have to tell, I have information from my own men in the Ukraine, and if you utter somuch as one word of a falsehood to me, I will have you taken out and hanged by the neck from the tower gate. Do you understand?"

"I understand," answered Peter, turning just a trifle pale at the threat. He was a bold man, he was a desperate man—otherwise he would not have ventured back into Krakow after having been defeated there twice—and he had no fear of death in any form, so long as he was free and able to fight. But now his knees smote together at the thought of hanging, and he resolved that he would keep close to the truth. After all, the whole affair was finished for him. The crystal was in the hands of the king, and he was not likely to part with it easily.

"One thing," he said in a low tone, "one thing, your Majesty, I beg, and that is that you will let none talk of what I say. For if it were known that I had spoken the truth, my life would not be worth—that"—he snapped his fingers. "I have your promise, your Majesty."

"You have."

"Then hear what I have to say. I am Bogdan, known in the Ukraine as the Terrible. Two years ago in March I was summoned to Moscow by one in authority, who said that a powerful lord had something to say to me. Now, having an open mind always for new activities, I went, although our people have but little love for Muscovites. And there I was taken to one Ivan."

The king interrupted. "You mean—"

"I mean Ivan himself, chief power among the Muscovites, son of that blind one. He has the ambition to unite all lands thereabouts under himself—as emperor, men say."

The king bit his lips and his eyes flashed. "This they havetold me," he exclaimed in an angry voice. "I only wanted the confirmation of it that you have given me. Ivan—Ivan—that one who makes friendly proffers to one's face and strikes in treachery when the back is turned." He strode up and down the room for a moment and then turned to the captive again. His tone was as calm as it had been in the beginning. "Proceed," he ordered.

"In this he has partially succeeded, but his ambitions run higher, and he dreams of establishing his power over the people outside the borders, the Ruthenians and Lithuanians. Knowing them to be willingly under Polish domain, however, even the city of Kiev, which fell beneath Tartar rule, he wishes instead to strike a blow at the Poles in the Ukraine. Someone advised that he loose the Tartars against the Poles, and an ambassador was even sent to find out what would induce the khan to send his warriors to fight the Poles. The answer that he made was a curious one."

"And that was—" asked the king.

"This was his answer. He would lead his Tartars against the Poles in the Ukraine on one condition, and that was that Ivan should deliver into his hands the Great Tarnov Crystal."

At this the whole company started, chief among them Pan Andrew, for none of them had suspected that such great importance was even now attached to the stone.

"How did he know of the crystal?" asked the king.

"Everyone in the East knows of the Great Tarnov Crystal," answered Bogdan. "Every worker of magic, every astrologer, every chief, every prince, is desirous of possessing this treasure. For it is said that, in addition to being a jewel of great value, it has this quality also, that one may look into it and there read of the future—one may also find there secrets of great worth, one may see the faces of men long since in their graves. There are many legends and stories of it too, and since the days when it disappeared from Tarnov, when the Tartars conquered western lands, there has been search after search to find it."

The king thought for a few seconds. "Then the khan of Tartars knew that he was asking Ivan for an impossibility when he demanded the crystal? Does that mean that he meant to refuse to go against the Poles?"

"Please—your Majesty—it was no such thing," Bogdan stated emphatically. "A short time ago a servant who had left the services of this man here," he pointed to Pan Andrew, "went to the land of the Tartars and there spread the report about that the crystal was to be had for the taking, that it was hidden in a country house in the Ukraine. You may be sure that this reached the ears of the khan, whose passion for curious jewels is almost a madness, and when I, going from Ivan to Tartary, learned this, then Ivan promised the khan that he would get him the crystal if it could be gotten."

"You were the go-between?"

Bogdan bowed.

"And Ivan sent you to get it from Pan Andrew?"

Bogdan bowed, though not quite so low.

Fire leaped into the king's eyes. "Dog that you are," he said, "less than beast in all things that Christians believe, for this you must destroy a man's house and ruin his fields, yes, and threaten his life, too, if it would serve your purpose.... God knows, my kingly duties lie heavily upon me.... All that I seek in this, my commonwealth, is peace, peace with my neighbors and happiness for my people.And yet Poland is ever insulted to the point where nothing but war is possible. It is not enough that enemies on the north and west threaten, there must be plots against our happiness on the south and east. Oh, Poland, Poland, when will the day come that thy sons and daughters may enjoy the tranquillity that God has designed for all people? ...As to you," he turned again to Bogdan, "what further have you to say?"

"Only that I have failed," answered Bogdan miserably. "And only that I know that I shall go free, for there was never yet Jagiello who did not keep his word. Though had it not been for this creature here"—he pointed to the alchemist, who from the rear of the room had been watching the scene through half-shut eyes—"I should have had the crystal long ago."

The king did not reply. "Take him away," he said to a guard.

A captain in armor came forward. "Deliver this Bogdan at sunrise to the guards of the Florian Gate. Tell them to see that he has safe-conduct through to the border, but that his chains are not to be struck off until he reaches the frontier. After that, let happen what will, but if he so much as sets foot again upon Polish soil, he shall be hanged to the nearest tree."

When they had departed, he said to Pan Andrew:

"In this, my right and duty of kingship in the Common-wealth of Poland, I commend you most heartily as a man who has been of great service to his country. It is a most extraordinary and gracious thing that a family such as yours should be so faithful to its word through so many years and be willing to suffer so much for an oath once given. Therefore to you go my whole thanks."

He took the gold chain from his throat. It was a thing ofwondrous beauty, of heavy solid links cut out of the purest metal.

"Wear this," he said placing it with his own hands over Pan Andrew's shoulders. "This chain shall ever be to you the token of your faithfulness. I shall see to it that the state makes return to you for the property which you have lost, for in so losing it you have conferred a favor upon us all. Had the crystal been taken by these thieves and delivered to the khan of the Tartars it is probably true that by now the Ukraine had begun to be overrun by Tartars and the armies of Ivan. In due time I shall see to it that a more formal and proper reward is given you."

Here Jan Kanty made a sign that the interview was finished, and the whole company fell upon their knees before the king.

He, too, stooped, but only to pick up the crystal, which had lain upon the floor before him during the entire interview. It seemed to Joseph, glancing up at that moment, that the instant the king's eyes were fixed upon the stone he became suddenly oblivious to everything else that was before him, and stood as one in a dream or trance, gazing into the depths of the fearsomely beautiful thing.





XVI. THE LAST OF THE GREAT TARNOV CRYSTAL


Joseph and his father were still kneeling when there came unexpectedly a certain happening that changed the whole complexion of the day. It came from the alchemist.

He had been listening attentively through all the talk; he had followed back and forth the give-and-take of conversation, the balancing of argument, the gestures, the decisions, even though his eyes had seemed but half open. Just at this final moment he sprang up from his place, behind the others, like a dog leaping for a bone and snatched the Tarnov Crystal out of the hands of the king.

Gripping it, he rushed, like one gone wholly mad, straight for the door, brushing aside a guard who fell back in astonishment.

"Stop him," cried Jan Kanty, "he will do something desperate."

They might better have tried to stop the wind. He was through the door and out on the balcony and down the steps to the court below, where the guards, though astonished, had yet no pretext for seizing him, since he was an honored guest, one of the party of Jan Kanty. Through the little entrance to the court he went at top speed, just as the king, the scepter bearers, and the guards, followed by Pan Andrew and Joseph, with Jan Kanty behind, raced along the balcony and shouted to the guards below. These at once set out in pursuit, shouting in turn to guards at the farther gates. But the alchemist wastraveling like a hurricane; and passing the men at arms at the very entrance to the castle, he was off down the slope to the meadows below, where he swung to the left and bore toward the spot where the Vistula curves about the base of the Wawel.

Pan Andrew and Joseph continued in pursuit with the guards, but the king, with Jan Kanty, seeing the alchemist's direction, hurried to the extreme end of the fortifications, where one looks down directly to the river. At the very water's-edge the alchemist turned and beckoned to his pursuers to stop, threatening by his motions to throw himself into the current, which at that time of the year was swollen and swift. They paused, helpless, waiting until he chose to speak.

"Listen," he cried, gazing first at the pursuing party that stood not far distant from him on the shore and then directly upward, where Jan Kanty and the king were leaning over the wall.

A curious figure he presented as he stood there for a moment in silence, his garments sadly disordered, his hair twitched hither and thither by the wind, his features working from emotion—the globe of amazing beauty in his hands.

"Listen!" His voice now rose shrill and screaming. "It was I that stole the crystal from Pan Andrew. The first sight of it drove honesty from my head, as it has driven honesty from the heads of many who have seen it. I saw there all the magicians and astrologers of all ages have devoutly wished for. I saw there the means of working out a great name for myself, of becoming famous, of becoming envied over all the world. I was tempted and I fell, but I shall see to it that no more trouble comes from this accursed stone."

He paused, overcome by the effort of so much speaking, butin a second a flood of wild laughter burst from him. "There was the student Tring," he shouted, "yes, Tring—who used to be my student. Because I looked so much into the crystal my mind grew weak, and he knew and I knew. It was he who said that if we but possessed the secret of turning brass into gold, then we should have power without stint, and it was he who first directed me to read in the glass what formula I might find therein for such magic. What did I find there?... Only the reflections of my own crazed brain. And at last between us we have done nothing but cause want and misery and suffering all over Krakow. It is because of our madness that half the city is now but a heap of ashes, that men and women and children are homeless and in poverty."

With these words his voice shrank to a wail, and he stood, a pitiful figure, his shoulders drooping, and his face turned toward the ground.

"Cease, man! We are thy friends," shouted the scholar.

"Nay. Such as I have no friends. But"—his shoulders suddenly straightened—"with such jewels as this, that cause strife between man and man, and war between nation and nation—here—now—I make an end!"

Then, raising himself to such a height that for a moment he appeared to be a giant, he swung about and hurled the crystal into the air with all his force.

The sun struck it there as it seemed for a moment to hang between earth and sky like a glittering bubble or a shining planet. Then it fell, fell, fell—until it dropped with a splash into the black, hurried waters of the Vistula River, so that the circles for a moment beat back the waves of the rushing torrent—then all was as before.

Deep silence fell upon the onlookers. There was in the man's act something solemn, something unearthly, something supernatural— his emotion was so great, and the crystal had been such a beauteous thing; and when Jan Kanty said, "Let us pray," the whole company fell upon their knees. When he had finished a simple prayer, they went forward and took up the alchemist where he had fallen, for he had dropped down as if he had been suddenly overcome by a sickness. They carried him back to the tower of the Church of Our Lady Mary, where his niece and Pan Andrew's wife watched over him.

Meanwhile the king called the scholar into conference, and after much parley, and much weighing of pros and cone, it was decided that no attempt should be made to rescue the crystal from the bed of the river. There had been in its history too much of suffering and misfortune to make it a thing at all desirable to possess, in spite of the purity of its beauty.

And should its hiding place become known—should a foreign power again seek to obtain it, what chance had such a power with the king's army and the fortified city of the Wawel forever ready in its defense? Surely never had treasure a safer resting place.

And so, to this day, it has never been disturbed, though in later centuries many men have sought for it, and it rests somewhere in the Vistula River, near the Wawel, where the alchemist Kreutz threw it in the year 1462.

Pan Andrew received from the state enough recompense to rebuild his house in the Ukraine, and he repaired there that same year, taking with him Elzbietka and the alchemist, who was broken in health for a long time as the result of his experiences. When hecame to his senses, a few days after he had thrown the crystal into the river, he had returned to his right mind fully, though he had no remembrance of the dark scenes in which he had played a part. The student Tring must have left for his home in Germany directly after the fire, for he was never seen again in Krakow. In later years he gained some fame in his own native village by the practice of magic, in which it was said that he often called upon the devil himself for assistance.

Joseph continued his studies in the university until he reached his twenty-second year, and then he returned to the Ukraine to manage his father's estates. He was shortly afterward married to Elzbietka, the friend of his boyhood days....

And now, since we have come to the happy end of all things in this tale, may we close with the thought that every Pole carries in his mind—with the words that are foremost in the Polish National Hymn:

May God Save Poland.





EPILOGUE: THE BROKEN NOTE


It is the year 1926. The Vistula River now no longer turns at the Wawel Hill and plunges straight through the Krakow plain, dividing the city of Kazimierz from the city of Krakow, but instead swings far to the left and surrounds the whole plain, now the new city. The castles and towers and cathedral of the Wawel still rise proudly on the hill, as in former days; St. Andrew's, which has defied fire, siege, and war for eight centuries, raises its head—two towers—above Grodzka Street; the old Cloth Hall, beautified during the Renaissance, still stands in the middle of the central Rynek. And although the glory of former days is departed from the city and kings no longer sit in the castle on the hill, there has come with the years the growth of a new glory, the glory of culture as seen in the university of fourteenth-century origin, in the schools of fine arts and music and handicraft and trade. From all Poland come students to study and to live in this venerable city, which is Gothic in every corner and every gable save where here and there a bit of Romanesque wall or arch has survived the Tartar, or the Cossack, or the Swede.

But the chief glory of the city is the Church of Our Lady Mary. It no longer stands apart, a monument visible from afar as of old—other palaces and buildings have shut it in, and one sees its towers only, until one is close upon it. Then the sudden magnificenceleaps upon the visitor. A splendid silence lurking in its high roof descends suddenly, like the thousands of pigeons that thunder down for particles of bread. Beneath one's feet is the old city cemetery; there on the walls are the tablets and shrines; there at the south doorway are the iron collars that once clasped the throats of petty criminals as they stood supplicating the prayers and pennies of the faithful. Inside, the church is a veritable miracle of beauty. Above its exquisite wood carvings and choir rises a vaulted roof of sky blue, studded with stars. Images of stone look down from breaks in the Gothic fluting—tablets, banners, altars, shrines—all strike alike upon the sight in amazing beauty.

But listen: is the organ playing? Whence come those notes that float down from above like God's own music from heaven? They come from the towers, for the hour is striking on the bell, and a trumpeter is playing at one of the open tower windows. And that tune? It is the Heynal, the same tune played by a young man so many centuries ago, when the Tartars burned the city—and listen, the trumpeter breaks off his song in the middle of a note.... Four times he sounds the Heynal, once at each of the four windows, west, south, east, north. And many a man or woman or child on hearing that song thinks of the days when the young life was given to country and God and duty.... Poland has been through many fires since that time—she has had centuries of war, a century of extinction. But in all that time the Heynal has sounded with each passing hour and men have sworn each year to keep the custom unto the very end of time. Hark, it is sounding now.

May it bring in an epoch of peace to all men!
