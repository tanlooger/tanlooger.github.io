译者序


雪莉·杰克逊是美国当代文学史上一位极具特色的女性作家，是美国在过去的一百年所产生的最重要的作家之一。她的作品在二十世纪的美国小说创作中是一道独特的风景线，而且随着岁月的流逝，愈发折射出耀眼的光芒。





一、雪莉·杰克逊生平及小说特色


雪莉·杰克逊1916年12月14日出生于美国的旧金山，还在少女时代便喜爱埃德加·爱伦·坡（Edgar Allan Poe）(1)的作品，高中课业成绩中除了英语外，各门功课都是“C”。1938年，二十二岁的雪莉·杰克逊在雪城大学（Syracuse University）读二年级时，在校文学刊物《门槛》（The Threshold）发表小说《珍妮丝》（Janice），引起了同在该校的文学青年斯坦利·埃德加·海曼（Stanley Edgar Hyman）的注意，该男生到处打听，“谁是雪莉·杰克逊？我一定要找到她，娶她回家。”两年后，海曼与雪莉·杰克逊一毕业就结成了连理，成为佳话。雪莉·杰克逊的丈夫也是一名卓有成就的文学评论家，并在雪莉·杰克逊过世后，出版了她的小说集《跟我来》（Come Along With Me）。1965年8月8日，雪莉·杰克逊在午睡中死于心脏病突发，时年仅四十九岁。

雪莉·杰克逊以哥特式小说被后人所铭记。美国著名悬疑小说家斯蒂芬·金(2)把雪莉·杰克逊列为对其创作风格影响最大的作家之一，而且美国文学界为纪念这位才华横溢的女作家，在2007年特意设立了雪莉·杰克逊奖（Shirley Jackson Award），专门表彰优秀悬疑、恐怖和黑色幻想类小说。奖项包括长篇小说奖、中篇小说奖、短篇小说奖、小小说奖、小说集奖。斯蒂芬·金曾在2009年获得该奖。雪莉·杰克逊以女性细腻的视角描写家庭琐事，这一点似乎有点儿像英国小说家简·奥斯汀，但与奥斯汀不同的是，雪莉·杰克逊的小说在这些琐事的背后带给人们的感觉是恐怖，她小说中永恒的主题是平常普通的家庭生活，抑或是社区生活中，人们不得不付出的难以言表的、出人意料的代价，而出人意料的结局则又延续了美国另外一位著名的短篇小说作家欧·亨利的特点。雪莉·杰克逊对文字的把握可以说是炉火纯青，有着超乎常人的天赋，她可以把看上去平常得如邻家大叔般的人物突然描绘得冷血、无情、残忍，这使得读完她的小说的众多读者，如同从噩梦中惊醒，惊魂未定中摸摸额头，分明觉得出了一脑门子冷汗。

在英语文学赏析课上，我常问学生们一个问题：惊悚小说和恐怖电影哪一个更让你们战战兢兢，汗不敢出？固然由于个人感受不同，答案也并非一致，但大多数真正喜欢文学的学生告诉我，还是读惊悚小说更刺激，原因就是，读者可以透过文字展开联想，越想象越害怕，套用一个现在很流行的词——细思极恐，倒是十分贴切。可恐怖电影即使画面可以很直观，而且伴随着音效，但无论是血腥暴力还是鬼怪惊乍，看完也就完了。所以，为帮助读者更好地欣赏雪莉·杰克逊小说的这种心理悬疑，我会对每篇作品稍加分析，当然这也是我作为译者的一孔之见。真正勇于挑战自己心理与智商的读者，完全可以忽视我下面的解读，自己去读、去思、去感受。





二、雪莉·杰克逊的成名作及其哥特式风格


《摸彩》是奠定雪莉·杰克逊在美国文学史上地位的成名作，这篇小说发表在1948年6月26日的《纽约客》（The New Yorker）上，小说一经刊出，便一石激起千层浪，引起了热议。正如雪莉·杰克逊自己在其杂文《一篇小说的传记》（Biography of a Story）中所说，读者们评价《摸彩》的邮件如雪片一样飞来，可谓是空前绝后。故事围绕着一个再普通不过的小村庄中一群再普通不过的村民展开。在一个阳光灿烂的夏日里，人们聚在一起举行一场传承已久的摸彩活动。孩子们尽情玩耍，妇女们谈着家庭琐事，男人们“谈论着播种和雨水、拖拉机和税收”。摸彩也看不出有何特异之处——“该活动犹如广场舞、青少年俱乐部项目，或者万圣节的节目”，给人带来的只是兴奋和好奇。接下来便是冗长乏味的摸彩仪式，以及男人们的玩笑话、妇女们家长里短的对白，仿佛一切都很和谐，尽管有华纳老汉的不满。可是当彩头被一位普通的家庭妇女哈钦逊太太抽到时，小说揭晓了谜底，同时也达到了高潮：

一块石头打在了她脑袋的一侧。华纳老汉招呼着众人，“大家都来，都来。”史蒂夫·亚当斯在村民队伍的前面，他的旁边是格雷乌斯太太。

“这不公平，这不应该。”哈钦逊太太惊恐地尖叫着。就在这时，他们扑向了她。

小说到此戛然而止，可读者在不解之中却不寒而栗。

这一小说的主题不禁让人想起了美国十七世纪新英格兰地区著名的塞勒姆女巫案。如果说哥特式小说常常把场景设置在阴森恐怖的古堡、月黑风疾的雨夜，人物往往是举止怪诞的畸人，情节悬念迭出，那么雪莉·杰克逊的这篇小说与上述规律看似背道而驰，但其艺术的张力更胜一筹，真是“于无声处听惊雷”。小说发表的第二年即斩获欧·亨利短篇小说奖，也就毫不奇怪了。

与此非常类似的一篇小说是《夏季的人们》。一对退休的夫妇，在乡下山区有一栋避暑的小屋，每年夏季他俩都会从纽约来到这里，尽管生活远不如城里方便，但环境优美，周围的乡民也都很友善，两个人在此的短暂生活一向都其乐融融。可就在他们决定打破多年的度假模式，再多待上一个月的时候，当地人的态度似乎有了微妙的变化：刚开始是劝告，“以前住在湖边的人家，还没有住到劳工节以后的”；然后是警告，拒绝卖给他们生活必需品——煤油；最后是某种威胁，破坏他们的小汽车，掐断他们的电话线，篡改或者偷拆他们的信件。在暴风雨来临的黑夜，两位老人明显感到危险步步逼近。

“我就知道不对劲，昨天晚上我看见霍尔家有灯光。”艾里逊先生说道。

湖面上突然起风了，在夏季小屋的四周旋转着，猛烈地吹打着窗户。艾里逊夫妇俩不由自主地往对方身边靠了靠，伴随着突如其来的一声炸雷，艾里逊先生伸出手去，握住了他妻子的手。就在这时，当外面的闪电划过夜空时，收音机里的声音逐渐消失，发出了噼啪声，两个老人在他们的夏季小屋中紧紧地抱在一起，等待着。

他们无助地等待着，可等到的是什么？是超自然的恶魔到访，还是抱残守缺的当地人的闯入，读者自己去揣摩。1951年，该小说获得了美国最佳短篇小说奖。

如果说，上面的两篇小说属于“非典型”哥特式小说，《拜访》则聚齐了哥特式小说的所有要素：魔幻般的屋子、禁止人们靠近的古堡、狂风暴雨、奇怪的老妇人、到访的客人、玛格丽特脸上的泪珠……故事讲述的是少女玛格丽特拜访同学卡拉家，玛格丽特最初对同学家的房子不断用“可爱”来赞叹，可没过多久，就在参观的过程中她发现了蹊跷：每个房间的墙上都是挂毯，而挂毯则是以各个房间为背景；每个房间都经过精心布置，尤其是那个如俄罗斯套娃般的房间，用镜子的折射造成了亦真亦幻的效果。大厅里用瓷砖贴成的图案，竟是一张少女的脸，而且旁边的一行字更是让人匪夷所思，“玛格丽特在此，她因爱而亡。”读者看到这儿，不免浮想联翩，疑窦顿生，这里所写的玛格丽特和来访的少女玛格丽特有何关系？“她因爱而亡”又指的是什么意思？如果说那些奇怪的房间已经让玛格丽特心惊肉跳了，那么那扇通往古塔的门后面又隐藏着什么秘密？古塔中住着什么人？为什么大家对它都讳莫如深？当玛格丽特终于抑制不住自己的好奇，独自上了塔楼时，见到了一位奇怪的老妇人，以及同样古怪的猫。当然，猫在西方文学中一直都是恶魔的化身，更吊诡的是这名老妇人竟然也叫玛格丽特。塔楼上的老妇人如同梦呓般的自言自语，狂风伴随着大雨，似乎预示着某种不祥。接下来，紧张的空气好像缓和了下来，因为卡拉的哥哥保罗和一名上尉回来了，他们在家里举行一场舞会。老妇人也在舞会上露面了，而且显然与保罗挺熟。在卡拉的家人送别保罗和上尉时，似乎时空与人物又错乱了，上尉指责房子破败，作为客人他凭什么这样说，而玛格丽特在跟保罗道别时，保罗这时又变成了上尉，以至于玛格丽特也在问自己，“是保罗吗？谁又是保罗？”而远处传来了老妇人的声音：“失去了，一切都失去了。”难怪有人说，《拜访》写的是一场爱情或者童话的变奏曲，里面有美丽的乡村别墅，形式各异的充满奇幻的房间，还有一位英俊的少主人，但实际上这是一个陷阱，古塔中疯狂的老妇人可能就是少女玛格丽特的未来。

如果说《拜访》通过少女玛格丽特的眼睛让我们看到了一个奇幻的世界，那么《林中的男人》展现给读者的则是一个魔幻世界。故事发生的地点是密林深处的小屋，年轻人克里斯多弗在一开始面对着岔路时——一条通往市镇，一条通往树林——勇敢地选择了通往树林的路，不由得使人想起了美国诗人罗伯特·弗罗斯特的诗歌《未选择的路》：

黄色的树林里分出两条路，

可惜我不能同时去涉足，

我在那路口久久伫立，

我向着一条路极目望去，

直到它消失在丛林深处。

（顾子欣译）

但是即使走在林中，克里斯多弗也在问一只不知从哪儿跑来的猫，“小家伙，我们去哪儿？有什么想法吗？”林中的小屋要么是童话中仙女的所在之处，要么是女巫所居之所，到底答案怎样？雪莉·杰克逊用小屋中一个女人的名字——瑟茜（Circe）——留下了线索，因为在希腊神话中，瑟茜有“女妖，女巫”之意。而小屋中原来就有的那只猫被称作“格瑞麦尔金”，有“恶毒的老妇”之意。至于说克里斯多弗带来的猫打跑了格瑞麦尔金，而被小屋主人欣然接受，并全盘取代家中原来的老猫的地位，甚至沿用了它的名字，则体现了“丛林法则”。小说的结尾还是雪莉·杰克逊惯用的叙述方式：密不透风的森林向克里斯多弗挤压过来，远处传来威胁的声音，“谁敢闯进我的林子？”该小说是雪莉·杰克逊逝世后，她已经成年的子女在她的遗物中发现的，与另一短篇小说《疑神疑鬼》陆续发表在《纽约客》上，再后来与其他未发表的随笔等结集出版。

小说《岩石》无疑也充分体现了雪莉·杰克逊美国哥特式小说的风格，淡季游人罕至的小岛、黑黢黢的岩石、阴森的石屋、奇怪的女房东、另一位神秘的游客。所有的故事围绕着妹妹宝拉、哥哥查尔斯、嫂子弗吉尼娅之间发生，这三位游客的身份和关系虽然很明确，但真正的微妙关系却模糊不清，读者从字里行间能够依稀感觉到小姑子和嫂子之间似乎是面和心不和。但更为奇怪的是，宝拉和那位不知究竟姓阿诺德还是约翰逊的小个子游客交往以后，那个男人对她施加了什么影响？为什么那个男人会说“一定是你们当中的一个人，你知道。我告诉过你我正在等你的嫂子，但是你先到了。这可是你自己的选择，你知道。我本来对你们两个中的任何一个都很满意”？而房东卡特太太大为紧张地告诉宝拉不要回应他，而且伸手去保护她。这个男人到底是谁？他要对宝拉或者她的嫂子做什么？难道他会是另外一个“恶魔情人”？

女巫的主题在雪莉·杰克逊的小说中一直占有很重要的位置，无论是前面介绍的几个短篇，还是以“女巫”直接命名的短篇小说。不过在《女巫》中，真正的女巫并未出现，而是通过一个小男孩之口告诉大家他看见了一个女巫，随后车厢里走来一个男人坐在小男孩旁边的座位上，开始很友好地跟小男孩聊天，可一会儿话锋就变了，他开始给小男孩讲暴力、恐怖的故事了，这引起了小男孩母亲的愤怒，她勒令那个男人离开。那个男人是女巫的化身吗？他和小男孩聊天仅仅是为了消除小男孩在火车旅途中的乏味与无聊吗？作者没有明说，读者可以按照自己的理解去揣摩，但越琢磨，越恐怖。





三、雪莉·杰克逊笔下的女性画廊


作为心理悬疑和恐怖小说女王，雪莉·杰克逊对女性形象和心理活动的描写极为细腻生动。她笔下的女性形象主要有三类：老年妇女、中年家庭主妇、少女，形成了丰富多彩的女性画廊。

短篇小说《岛》通过老妇人蒙塔古夫人一天的生活琐事和中间的插叙展开。蒙塔古夫人年老体衰，孤独地生活在一栋公寓里。儿子虽然很有钱，但只能借出差的时机偶尔过来看望她一下，整日陪伴她的是一个看护奥克斯小姐，每天可能最让蒙塔古夫人开心的事情就是给图画填颜色了。这里提醒大家注意的一点是，蒙塔古夫人偏爱蓝色，甚至奥克斯小姐还讥笑她把所有的填涂色都画成了蓝色，橱窗里最吸引老太太的也是一个蓝碗，蓝色为中间一段老太太回忆年轻时候的插叙埋下了伏笔，也正是小说篇名所暗示的——岛的色彩。在追忆似水年华中，暮年的蒙塔古夫人每日梦想的是海岛，是万里无云的蓝天，是碧波荡漾的海水。

在《公共汽车》中，同样处于不知是梦中醒还是醒中梦的老哈珀小姐，坐上了一趟回家的公共汽车。与慷慨的蒙塔古夫人不同的是，老哈珀小姐似乎家道中落，这使得她总是怨天尤人，抱怨公交公司，抱怨公交司机，抱怨人们把古屋改作了汽车旅馆，她甚至一直盘算着要去投诉司机。虽然对对她伸出援手的两个年轻人也心有怨气，但无奈之下敢怒不敢言，其可恨、可怜、可悲的形象跃然纸上。柜中各种玩具的大表演，以及老哈珀小姐的反应，充分体现了雪莉·杰克逊刻画人物和推动情节发展的超自然描写功力。而最后，老哈珀小姐的梦醒了，却发现梦变成了现实，她被撂在了空无一人的陌生之地的雨夜中。

不知是老人变坏了，还是坏人变老了。在《邪恶的可能性》中，自以为是文明道德捍卫者、小镇优秀传统护卫者的老艾德拉·斯特兰沃思小姐，却是一个内心黑暗、说一套做一套的伪善者。但老斯特兰沃思小姐的精心算计却因为把匿名信掉落在邮筒之外而彻底曝光。小说的结尾处，作者虽然并未挑明态度，但读者却有一种善恶有报的快感。

在《小房子》中，一位年轻女子从城里远赴乡间小镇去接受她婶婶留给她的一份遗产——一栋小房子。可她从最初接受遗产的兴奋，筹划房里的装饰、添置生活用品的喜悦，开始转到对婶婶死因的猜测。夜晚降临，快乐的心情似乎随着太阳落山而低落，她再次审视这栋小房子：

她的婶婶在窗台上留下了一个熟烂了的西红柿，它使得厨房里有一股浓重的腐烂味道。这时，她浑身一激灵，意识到后门还大敞着，记起婶婶曾说过，真切得就好像话音还在耳边，“要把门修一下，我希望自己能记得让人把弹簧锁好好修一下。”

而街坊邻居——两位老妇人，多尔逊姐妹的到访本来可以缓和一下紧张的空气，可她们的言谈更让年轻女子感到恐惧。

“我原以为是他回来了。”卡洛琳小姐又把手放到了伊丽莎白的手臂上，好像是她把伊丽莎白领到了客厅。“他们说看见他了，你知道。”

这个他到底是谁，和婶婶的死有什么关系？

“要是她高声尖叫，我们应该能听到的。”卡洛琳小姐一边说，一边举起了干瘦的手以示强调。“他们说她一定是认出了他，我自己也确信，关于这人到底是谁，诺尔顿警长有了精明的想法。我相信我们也都有自己的怀疑对象。”

显然，这位老妇人是个长舌妇，但也似乎在向年轻女子表明她婶婶不是死于心脏病，而是谋杀。这两位老妇人的目的达到了，年轻女子害怕了。

门后会有什么等着她呢？她一想到这儿，马上转过身，疯了似的跑下了楼梯，跑进了亮着灯的厨房，厨房的后门已经上了锁。“别把我一个人留在这儿，”她一边说，一边转身看着身后，“请不要把我一个人留在这儿。”

然而，老妇人说的话是真的吗？该不会是为了把她吓走吧？在小说的结尾，两个老妇人的对话让我们觉得这可能又是一个“邪恶的可能性”。

此外，在雪莉·杰克逊小说对老年妇女的刻画中，这些老年妇女性格各异，有好客但也不忘图利的弗恩太太（《跟我来》），有守旧而自私的多尔逊姐妹（《小房子》），有天真、热情的皮库克太太（《露易莎，请回家吧》）。通过对她们的语言、行动、心理状态的描写，众多人物形象无一不栩栩如生。

在雪莉·杰克逊所刻画的人物长廊中，中年妇女的形象也比较鲜明，这可能跟她自身的年龄和四个孩子母亲的身份有关。雪莉·杰克逊笔下的中年妇女要么住在一栋大房子里，要么想方设法地想摆脱大房子。在未完成的小说《跟我来》中，安吉拉·摩妥尔曼太太抛弃了和丈夫休伊以前共同生活的房子，卖掉了所有的家当，甚至连自己的名字也放弃了，她来到一个陌生的地方，和别的房客一起租房子住。她宁肯和房东以及其他房客有着不即不离的社会关系，也不愿让家庭的束缚刺得遍体鳞伤。也许是对以前循规蹈矩、一成不变生活的反叛，摩妥尔曼太太用超自然的通灵的方式与鬼神沟通，甚至不惜用去商店行窃的方式打破生活的枯燥与乏味。

在《美丽陌生人》中，一位家庭妇女某一天察觉到来到她身边的男人并非自己的丈夫时，心中一阵喜悦，因为她的丈夫是“喜欢看我哭的男人”。但是如果他不是自己的丈夫约翰，那么她是妻子玛格丽特吗？她有权利做另外一个人吗？她有资格过上另外一种更好的生活吗？一连串的问题接踵而来。短暂的幸福和兴奋过后，她在给那位美丽陌生人买完礼物回家的路上，发现自己找不到家门了。显然这位两个孩子的母亲——独守空房的家庭妇女虽然认识到“孤独是世界上最糟糕的感觉”，但是在做完一个美丽的梦之后，一切又归于幻灭。

《恶魔情人》讲述的是一名女子寻找其失踪的未婚夫的故事。小说中的女主人公已经三十四岁了，早已不是风华正茂的年纪，时刻担心脸上的皱纹，而且焦虑穿衣打扮不得体。在经过苦苦寻找之后，女主人公分明能够感觉到她的未婚夫就在门后或者某个窗户后看着她，可就是不露面。小说越到后面，越高潮迭至，但谜团更浓。

雪莉·杰克逊的小说始终以女巫、恶魔、超自然为主题，这篇小说的篇名来自一个著名的同名英语民谣，民谣中蛊惑人的恶魔名叫詹姆斯·哈里斯，这也恰恰是小说中女主人公失踪的未婚夫的名字。但要真正读懂这篇小说，读者需要仔细地研究女主人公的心理活动，而不是她的行动。要知道，在战后的美国，女子到了二十岁往往就谈婚论嫁了，而女主人公内心对结婚的焦虑读者时时刻刻能够感受到。真正情绪不稳、精神出现问题，甚至萌生幻觉的恰恰是女主人公自己，而恶魔情人詹姆斯·哈里斯无非是引诱女主人公精神崩溃的“心魔”罢了。

雪莉·杰克逊的女权主义意识还体现在小说《露易莎，请回家吧》中。小说通过十九岁的少女露易莎的离家出走，体现了一位叛逆少女在成长过程中自我认知的觉醒。露易莎的雨衣在小说中被反复提及，其中一个细节是露易莎把她妈妈给她买的外套换成了雨衣，表明她对原来的家庭、自我的抛弃。露易莎姓泰瑟尔（Tether），这个词在英文中作为普通名词意思是“约束”，而露易莎之所以把名保留而把姓换掉，正是要摆脱掉“约束”。小说的结尾也构思巧妙，本来亲人相聚应该泪眼涟涟地相互拥抱，可露易莎一家人认为她是冒名顶替者，可见二十世纪六十年代的美国人与人之间产生了怎样的信任危机。





四、雪莉·杰克逊笔下的男性形象


雪莉·杰克逊笔下的男性形象不是很多，但少数的几个男性形象同样非常传神。比如小说《我在乎的不是钱》，那个在公园中散步，时不时与人搭讪的中年男人，虽然嘴上说“我在乎的不是钱”，可又处处炫耀，一会儿说他培养了一个童星女儿，可以做未来的秀兰·邓波儿；一会儿又说，他是一名拳击中量级冠军的经纪人，可拿出的证据是从报纸或者杂志上剪下的图片。他究竟是个夸夸其谈的人——请注意生活中这样的人大有人在——还是想钱想疯了的势利之徒，甚至是个精神病患者，请读者自己去做判断。

《疑神疑鬼》是2013年8月5日发表在《纽约客》上的，此时距离作者离世已经过去了四十三年，作者的儿子在国会图书馆中偶然发现了他母亲的手稿。故事讲述的是，一天纽约商人哈洛伦·贝雷斯福德先生很开心地离开了办公室，因为他记得当天是他太太的生日，他打算在回家的路上买糖果，也计划带他太太出去吃晚餐并看一场戏。可就在回家的路上他意识到有人跟踪他，不管他怎样想尽力摆脱掉跟踪者，但都没成功。最后他终于平安到家了，但发现自己并没有脱离危险。这个故事最大的悬念在于，贝雷斯福德先生所感受到的危险是真的呢，还是他自己臆想出来的。

从小说的标题似乎可以得出答案，天下本无事，是贝雷斯福德先生在疑神疑鬼。但往深里想，事情并非那么简单，雪莉·杰克逊也绝不是那么肤浅的小说家。小说中紧张的跟踪与反跟踪，到底是贝雷斯福德先生自己吓唬自己，还是确有其事？读者在这种反复的猜想之中一步步地陷入了作者所营造的不安与不确定的气氛当中。比如，店员在店门口堵住了贝雷斯福德先生，既可以看作一种咄咄逼人的动作，也可以看作他急于揽客的举动。还有在公交车上，司机到站不停车，还冲着贝雷斯福德先生喊叫“去投诉我吧”，既可以看作对贝雷斯福德先生的挑衅，也可以看作他本身就厌烦了这工作，丢掉与否无所谓。在这种是真是假摇摆不定的疑惑中，读者自身也会疑神疑鬼起来。

其实，这种疑神疑鬼也是有着历史背景的。雪莉·杰克逊的儿子在《纽约客》的一次访谈中提到，这篇小说很可能创作于二十世纪四十年代的初期。当时正值二战，美国社会中弥漫着彼此不信任和危险的气息，甚至外国和美国政府的关系也笼罩着这种情绪，情报机构在四处抓间谍。这种不信任也体现在了贝雷斯福德先生身上。在公交车上，作者写道：

一个是看上去像是外国人的男人。外国人，贝雷斯福德先生看了他一眼，一下子想到了外国人、外国的阴谋、间谍。

事实上，不管你相不相信贝雷斯福德先生的遭遇，读完整篇小说你都可能产生惊心、烧脑、纠结之感，如果你相信贝雷斯福德先生是被人跟踪了，你可能会害怕，就像贝雷斯福德先生一样，你也会害怕那个跟踪者。如果你相信那是贝雷斯福德先生的胡猜乱想，则他可能采取什么样的行动来应对这种臆测也会让你感到不寒而栗。





五、雪莉·杰克逊的家庭式小说


《生日派对》是雪莉·杰克逊典型的“家庭式”（domestic）小说，十一岁的小女生詹妮为庆祝自己十一岁的生日，邀请了四位同学来家里参加睡衣派对。家里人除了妈妈支持外，爸爸和大儿子均表示反对。小说主要通过对话展现了一个美国普通人家的家庭生活：处于青春期孩子的“成长的烦恼”，家庭主妇的操劳操心。小说形象生动，描写细腻，风格独特，格调轻松，语言幽默。为此，1964年，《生日派对》荣获最佳美国短篇小说奖。

《我知道我爱着谁》同样表现了雪莉·杰克逊对于家庭关系的思考。子女和父母应该是怎样的关系？父母应该怎么教育子女？父母在子女的婚姻上应该秉持一种什么样的态度？应该说凯瑟琳·文森特从上学到工作，无不受到她刻板教条的、做牧师的父亲的影响，同样也受到唯唯诺诺的母亲的影响。尽管时过境迁，但在凯瑟琳恋爱的问题上，父母和女儿之间的隔阂将永远存在。

《发中的花椰菜》描写的也是一家三口的简单生活：

加兰德夫妇和他们的女儿维吉尼亚住在小镇上一栋很舒适的房子里……维吉尼亚十五岁，加兰德先生三十九岁，而加兰德太太四十一岁。

对于维吉尼亚的同学米莉的来访，加兰德夫妇对她的态度大不相同，加兰德太太认为米莉不正经，而加兰德先生则不断地在挑逗着米莉。该小说是雪莉·杰克逊在1944年完成的，是她的早期作品之一。

《珍妮丝》是雪莉·杰克逊1938年在大学学习期间发表的崭露头角的作品，全篇不过五六百字，却把一个少女上不上学的矛盾心理刻画得细致入微。可究竟为什么不能上学了呢？是恶作剧还是出于什么样的心理，作者没有挑明。但从中可以看出雪莉·杰克逊通过对话展示暗黑心理，以及充满悬疑的写作技巧之端倪。





六、雪莉·杰克逊小说的多面性


雪莉·杰克逊的小说本来以叙述家庭生活的平常琐事见长，虽然小说中有很多黑暗的心理描写，有着悬疑恐怖气氛的渲染和出人意料的结尾，有着对人性邪恶的深刻剖析，但较少触及重大社会和政治问题，其作品很少描绘积极向上的正面人物，而下面的两篇小说却是例外。

《花园》的题材涉及美国二十世纪五六十年代一个极为严重的社会问题——种族歧视。种族主义蔓延在整个小镇，因同情和雇用黑人打理花园，导致外来的麦克莱恩太太被孤立、被排挤，最后被迫离开小镇。

小说一开始，作者描写了小镇上维宁太太一家，他们住在古老的庄园中，做婆婆的老维宁太太是传统保守势力的代表。而作为儿媳妇的小维宁太太表面上对于相夫教子的生活很满意，实际上跟雪莉·杰克逊笔下所有的中年妇女一样，对当前压抑的生活状态充满怨气，既想逃避，又无法摆脱。这也就是为什么小维宁太太会妒忌搬到那间农舍的麦克莱恩太太，羡慕麦克莱恩太太对农舍的布置。麦克莱恩太太满是亮丽色彩的房屋与维宁太太家阴沉沉的古屋形成了鲜明的对比，在雪莉·杰克逊的小说中，女主人公的居所就代表着她们的身份和性格特征。两位中年妇女年龄相仿，志趣相投，一起逛杂货店，一起串门喝咖啡聊天。可当麦克莱恩太太雇用黑人约翰作园丁时，周围人的态度都变了。

花园在小说中极具象征意义，当维宁太太和麦克莱恩太太关系融洽，保持着友谊时，花园中就枝繁叶茂。甚至就在麦克莱恩太太因为雇用黑人帮工闹得满城风雨，维宁太太虽然对麦克莱恩太太不满，但成功地掩饰住了原因时，花园仍然保持着五彩缤纷的活力。可就在维宁太太第一次回避麦克莱恩太太并公开嘲笑她时，花园中的花儿开始枯萎了。当最后狂风暴雨完全摧毁了花园，花园中一片狼藉时，象征着维宁太太也顺从了小镇上那种不公正和偏执的传统，决定把麦克莱恩太太逐出小镇。

《来爱尔兰与我共舞》辛辣地讽刺了三个女人的庸俗、无知和以貌取人，揭示了她们在整个事件中的偏执。所有的女人都认为奥弗莱厄蒂先生是个贫困潦倒的老人，他理所当然要为所受到的好心帮助而感激涕零。基于这种想法，这些女人反而显得粗鲁无礼。

但是三个女人对待老人的态度还是有差别的。公寓的主人阿彻太太在给老人食物的问题上是有所保留的，她只是在凯西的一再坚持下才去做的。比如小说中有这样的描写：

阿彻太太看上去有点儿犹豫不决，“我这儿有些鸡蛋。”她说道。

另外，当凯西问她家里是否有葡萄酒可以让老人喝点儿时：

阿彻太太摇了摇头。“有一点儿葡萄酒。”她犹犹豫豫地说道。

这些例子表明，阿彻太太对老人的动机还是满腹狐疑的，只是在她朋友一再坚持下才提供给他吃的东西，这说明阿彻太太还是有些警惕性的，对于陌生人还是有些怀疑，而不是简简单单展现女主人的好客与热心。

另一方面，凯西·瓦伦丁居高临下地发号施令让别人围着老人转，来显示她的能干和慈悲胸怀。当阿彻太太给了老人二十五美分时，凯西认为“完全可以”。凯西说道：“可能比他一整天挣到的都多。”说这话的理由是因为她看到老人蓬头垢面，所以说话并不客气：

“您现在还是老老实实地坐在那儿吧。”凯西命令道，“这位阿彻太太要去给您拿点儿葡萄酒，您能喝葡萄酒，没错吧？”

她对奥弗莱厄蒂先生说话的口吻就像在训斥一个小孩子，而不是像对待一个完全有能力照顾好自己的成年人。这种态度显然与阿彻太太的不同，是一种粗暴、以恩主自居的态度。

奥弗莱厄蒂先生尽管外表落魄，可他知道叶芝，而且能够随口诵出叶芝的诗句，说明他并不是这三个女人眼中的无家可归的流浪汉或者醉鬼。作为小说中唯一的男性形象，奥弗莱厄蒂先生能够衬托出女人们的狭隘。她们好像举止有礼，慷慨大方，可实际上这些养尊处优的女人动机并不纯，而且故作姿态。虽然奥弗莱厄蒂先生举止乖张，似乎对接受免费的食物和主人的好客没有表现出足够的感恩，但这恰恰说明了他的诚实与直率。离开时，他告诉了女人们他对她们的真实看法，而没有出于社交礼仪和传统做法去刻意隐藏他的想法（当然这也可能是他被人排斥的原因之一）。

雪莉·杰克逊把叶芝的诗歌作为小说的标题也有着很深的用意。叶芝曾写过一首《我来自爱尔兰》（I am of Ireland）的诗歌，其中就包含了奥弗莱厄蒂先生所引用的诗行：出于慈善而来/来爱尔兰与我共舞。最后，作者对叶芝诗歌的引用逐步深入，读者可能会悟出，雪莉·杰克逊笔下的约翰·奥弗莱厄蒂可能就是叶芝诗歌中的那位“老人”吧，原诗中那位“瞪起一只恶毒的眼睛”的老人默念着奥弗莱厄蒂在结尾的那句诗行：时间飞逝。对叶芝诗行的引用，间接地提示了“邪恶的可能性”，哪怕雪莉·杰克逊在小说中设置了日常生活的家庭场景，但读者很容易把约翰·奥弗莱厄蒂和叶芝诗歌中的神秘老人联系起来，作者暗示他具有更加险恶的潜质，也许就是另一个詹姆斯·哈里斯，或者恶魔情人。

《口袋里有花生的普通一天》可能是雪莉·杰克逊的唯一能看到人性中光明的一面，能够感受到正能量的作品。约翰·菲利普·约翰逊先生在普通的一天，心情很好地走在大街上。一路上约翰逊先生帮助正忙于搬家的单身母亲照看小孩，看到两个匆匆忙忙赶去上班的年轻人，突发奇想，告诉他们工作不是生活的全部，也许最后他还凑成了这一对的姻缘。

“去布朗克斯动物园，或者去天文馆。实际上，不管什么地方，”他总结道，“任何你们想去的地方，去度过一段快乐时光。”

他还好心地给一对正在寻找出租房的年轻人提供信息，给纠结中的出租车司机提供好的建议。在小说的结尾部分，从约翰逊夫妇的对话中，我们能看出两口子截然相反的性格特征，与约翰逊先生的宽厚、善良、慷慨形成鲜明对比的是约翰逊太太的睚眦必报、心胸狭窄、刻薄恶毒。

总之，以上对雪莉·杰克逊二十三篇小说的解读既是译者本人在翻译过程中个人的理解，又是浅尝辄止、片鳞只爪的分析，文学的韵味在于一千个读者眼里有一千个哈姆雷特，所以最为关键的还是要请读者自己细细品味。

珍妮丝


第一次，她是在电话中，用一种半开玩笑半忧伤的口吻对我说：“我觉得再也上不了学了……”

“为什么呀，珍？”

“呃，是因为我妈妈，她说我们家负担不起了。”我简直无法描述说这话时珍妮丝声音中那种满不在乎的腔调。实际上她是在用一种很平淡的语气说着一个可望而不可即的东西。“所以我觉得我不会再上学了。”

“我真的很遗憾，珍。”

但是过了一会儿，她好像又突然想起了什么。“你知道吗？”

“什么？”

“今天下午我差点儿要了自己的命。”

“珍！怎么回事？”

她用古怪、冷漠的口吻说道：“我把自己锁在车库里，然后发动了汽车。”

“可是为什么呀？”

“我不知道。可能是因为我不能回去上学的原因吧，我想。”

“后来呢？”

“呃，有个家伙正在修剪我们的草坪，他听见了马达声，跑过来发现了我，那个时候我都快要一命归西了。”

“真是太可怕了，珍。你究竟被什么迷住了心窍……”

“呃，好了，还是……”她改变了话题，“今晚还去萨利家吗？”

后来，在萨利家的那天晚上，大家都没怎么注意珍妮丝，但是她坐在那儿，一会儿对着我，一会儿又对着鲍勃说：“今天下午我差点儿自杀了，鲍勃。”

“什么！”

她轻声地说：“我差点儿杀了自己。我把自己反锁在车库里，让汽车的马达一直转着。”

“到底为什么呀，珍？”

“我想是因为他们不想让我上学了。”

“哦，我很遗憾听你这么说，珍。但是今天下午是怎么回事？瞧你都干了些什么？”

“正在割草的工人救了我。”

萨利走了过来，问：“怎么啦，珍？”

“呃，我上不了学了。”

我这时忍不住插了话：“快死的时候是什么感觉，珍？”

她哈哈大笑起来，“哇，好玩，四周一片漆黑。”然后，她对着瞠目结舌而又半信半疑的萨利说道：“今天下午，我差点儿自杀，萨利……”





发中的花椰菜


加兰德夫妇和他们的女儿维吉尼亚住在小镇上一栋很舒适的房子里，每天晚上七点钟的时候，他们会一起享用一顿可口的晚餐。饭菜是一位名叫艾格尼丝的女佣准备的，她厨艺很好，也把房间打扫得一尘不染，就是铺床叠被的技能实在不敢恭维。加兰德先生和太太分属于两个不同的镇上会所，聚会时，加兰德先生把小胡子梳理得很整齐，而加兰德太太已经不再穿正式的晚礼服，而改穿简便的晚宴装了。她还有两件皮外套，一件是豹纹的，另一件是材料质地稍逊的貂皮。维吉尼亚上高中一年级，正在和篮球队的队长约会。每逢周六的晚上，加兰德先生都会先和这位小伙子握握手，然后愉快地聊几句有关战争的情况，直到维吉尼亚浑身散发着她母亲的香水味，从楼梯上走下来。维吉尼亚十五岁，加兰德先生三十九岁，而加兰德太太四十一岁。

一天傍晚，在晚餐的时候——大约是七点二十分左右——维吉尼亚开口说：“妈，米莉说她今天晚上要来咱家，我可以不用帮艾格尼丝刷碗了吗？”

“米莉是什么呀？”加兰德先生问道，眼睛盯着艾格尼丝正端上来的一盘花椰菜，“一头奶牛？”

维吉尼亚咯咯笑着，“她看上去还真有一点儿像呢，”她说道，“只不过不是一头奶牛。她叫米莉，我们一个学校的，她要来找我，我们一起做代数作业。”

“你帮艾格尼丝刷碗的时候，米莉可以等着你。”加兰德太太说道。她看着维吉尼亚，想让她明白不能惹艾格尼丝不高兴。“用不了十分钟的，米莉可以等你。”

“我会招待米莉的，”加兰德先生打着圆场说，“在做代数作业方面，我和米莉都能帮你。我以前代数可是学得不错的。”他一本正经地对加兰德太太说道。

“你还擅长聊天。”加兰德太太说道，“在热的花椰菜变凉之前，再吃点儿吧。艾格尼丝也得吃点儿。”

“米莉来我们学校的时间不长，”维吉尼亚说道，“她是第二学期才来的，我正在帮她补课。”

“你真是太好了。”加兰德先生说道。

门铃响了，维吉尼亚放下了餐巾。“她说要早点儿来，还真就来了。”她说道。

“会是米莉吗？”加兰德先生问道。

维吉尼亚去开门，不一会儿，加兰德夫妇就听到了她的声音从门厅处传来，然后她领着米莉回到了餐厅。米莉很漂亮，但看上去并不太机灵，她画着很重的黑眼影，涂着很浓的口红。

“我的父母。”维吉尼亚一边向米莉介绍，一边打算再次落座在餐桌旁，“这位是米莉。拉把椅子过来坐这儿吧，米莉。”

加兰德太太微微皱了皱眉，“你吃过晚饭了吗，米莉？”

“吃了。”米莉说道。她看了一眼维吉尼亚，咯咯笑了起来。“我应该在客厅里等，”她说道，“可金妮说让我来这儿。”

“当然没问题。”加兰德先生说，“吃点儿花椰菜吗？”

米莉盯着加兰德先生又咯咯笑了起来。

“如果你不喜欢吃它，”加兰德先生说，“你也可以把它戴到你的头发上。”

“我爸爸总是满嘴跑火车，”维吉尼亚对米莉说道，“他老是这样，别理他。”

“也许你可以跟我们一起吃点儿甜点，米莉？”加兰德太太建议道。

“不了，谢谢你。”米莉说道。

“如果你吃了东西，”加兰德先生对着米莉故作怒视状，“你就得刷碗。这间屋子里的任何人只要吃了东西，在餐后就不得不去厨房里刷碗。”

“查尔斯！”加兰德太太说道，“你会吓着这孩子的。”

“米莉什么都不怕，妈妈。”维吉尼亚说，“米莉和我能做任何事情。”

“我敢打赌米莉能做任何事情。”加兰德先生说道。他的妻子抬头看着他。

“维吉尼亚，”她最后说道，“既然你和米莉得做代数，我会跟艾格尼丝解释，你没帮她，她不会介意的。”

“万岁。”维吉尼亚欢呼道，“来吧，米莉。那我们去了，妈妈？”

加兰德太太点了点头，维吉尼亚从椅子旁站起身，向米莉招手让她跟着，随即跑出了餐厅。

维吉尼亚和米莉离开以后，加兰德夫妇沉默了好一阵子。加兰德太太终于开口道：“她看上去并不是一个很好的女孩，对吗，这个叫米莉的孩子？”

“我不知道。”加兰德先生边说，边放下了咖啡杯，“我看她还不错。”

又过了一会儿，加兰德夫妇又安静地坐在了客厅中，加兰德太太手里正在刺绣——她想给小凳子绣个坐垫——加兰德先生正在看《星期六晚邮报》。这时从楼上传来一阵维吉尼亚和米莉嘈杂的脚步声，随后她们风风火火地进了客厅。

“妈妈，”维吉尼亚进门时喊道，“妈妈，我们已经做完了家庭作业，我们能出门买瓶汽水吗，妈妈？”

加兰德太太沉吟了一下，“我想可以，”她慢条斯理地说道，“但要快点儿回来。”

“等一下。”加兰德先生一边说着话，一边把手伸到口袋里，“买些冰激凌回来，我们大家一起吃，你妈妈和我也想吃点儿冰激凌了。”

“我可不想……”加兰德太太说道。

维吉尼亚赶忙跑过来一把从她父亲手里抢过钞票。“两分钟就回来。”话音未落，她和米莉已经跑出了门。

“她们总是风风火火的，这俩孩子。”加兰德太太嘟囔着，又忙着手中的刺绣了。

“年轻人嘛，”加兰德先生说道，“让她们玩会儿吧。”

“我觉得我们不应该鼓励维吉尼亚找米莉这样的女孩做朋友。”加兰德太太说，“她看上去不像个正经的女孩。”

“我看着还行。”加兰德先生说道。

米莉和维吉尼亚把冰激凌放在小碟子里，把它们端到了加兰德夫妇的面前。加兰德先生故意装作不高兴的样子接了过来，“为什么呀，米莉，”他问道，“你拿走了那么多，只给我剩这么一点儿呀？”

米莉咯咯笑着，“我的并没有比你的多呀，加兰德先生。”

“是我自己舀出了一块。”维吉尼亚说道。

“你肯定也舀了，米莉。”加兰德先生还在不依不饶，“我被抢劫了。”他走到米莉跟前，把两碟冰激凌比较了一番，然后紧挨着她坐在了沙发上。“现在我就坐在这儿，”他说，“看你一口一口吃，然后数你吃了几口，这样你就会后悔没多给我舀一些了。”

米莉又咯咯地笑了起来，“快打住吧，加兰德先生，”她说，“我都笑得呛住了。”

“查尔斯，”加兰德太太嗔怪地说，“你在破坏姑娘们的快乐时光。”

“没有，加兰德太太，”米莉说道，“我觉得加兰德先生太逗了。”

“现在又说我逗了，”加兰德先生说，“你一开始抢了我的冰激凌，然后又认为我很逗，其实就是在说我是个傻老头，我想。”

“您并不老。”米莉说道。

“他岁数已经足够大了，没法再扮演小丑了。”加兰德太太尖刻地说道。

“我觉得您一点儿也不老。”米莉大不以为然，“说真的，我认为您还年轻。”

加兰德先生看着米莉，“你说我有多年轻？”他追问道。

米莉咯咯地笑个不停。

“我爸爸总爱这样，”维吉尼亚对米莉说，“他老是作弄人。”

“你不会跟我这样年纪的人约会吧？会吗，米莉？”加兰德先生说道。

米莉抬头看了看他，“我不能说。”她说道。

“那现在就别取笑我了。”加兰德先生说道。

加兰德太太站起身，放下了手中的针线活，向门口走去。她在门边停下来，迟疑了一下，“维吉尼亚，”她喊道，但并没有转身。“我想跟你谈一谈，请来一下。”

维吉尼亚站了起来，跟着她母亲走出了房间。“我去去就来，米莉。”她说道。

维吉尼亚走了以后，米莉向加兰德先生转过身子，“加兰德太太对我说的话或者做的什么事不高兴了吗？”她问道。

“别管她。”加兰德先生说道。他摸了摸米莉头发上的花。“花儿真漂亮。”他说道。

“我男朋友送我的。”米莉说道。

“有男朋友了？”加兰德先生说，“他约你出去过吗？你们在一起开心吗？”

米莉忍不住又傻笑了，“那是当然。”她说道。

“他都带你去了哪儿？”加兰德先生问道，“他带你去过镇中心的一个地方吗，他们称为‘蓝灯笼’的俱乐部？”

“我去过那儿。”米莉回答道。

加兰德先生起身，走到房间的另一侧去拿了一根香烟。然后思忖了一下，又递给了米莉一根。

“她快回来了吗？”米莉问道，伸出了手。

“加兰德太太吗？可能一时半会儿还回不来。”

米莉拿着香烟，加兰德先生为她点着了烟。

“她不喜欢我。”米莉说着，身子靠了过来。

“我不这么认为。”加兰德先生说道。

“可维吉尼亚是个非常好的伙伴。”米莉说道。加兰德先生哈哈大笑了起来，米莉困惑地抬头看着他，“我说什么了，这么好笑？”她问道。

维吉尼亚回到了门口，在那儿站了一会儿。

“米莉。”她叫道，而米莉正拽着加兰德先生的手，执拗地想让他拿着她的烟。“米莉，”维吉尼亚说道，“我妈想知道，我们还能不能再跑一趟，去商店帮她买点儿东西。你想去吗？”

米莉迟疑着，这时加兰德太太也回到了门口，在维吉尼亚身后站着。“查尔斯，”她说道，“我跟维吉尼亚说了，如果她和米莉为我跑一趟商店，就像好孩子那样，你会给她俩每人十美分的硬币。”

“我们用它再买瓶汽水。”维吉尼亚说道。

“吃完冰激凌后还喝汽水？”加兰德太太宽容地问道，“你也想要一枚十美分的硬币，对吧，米莉？”

米莉犹豫了一下，“走吧，米莉，”维吉尼亚不耐烦地说道，“爸爸，给我们钱。”

加兰德先生看着他妻子，伸手向兜里摸去，然后掏出了一枚二十五美分的硬币。“给你。”他说道。

维吉尼亚上前拿了硬币，然后拉着米莉的胳膊，向大门走去。

加兰德太太坐了下来，又拿起了她的针线活。“查尔斯，”她若无其事地问道，“你难道不觉得孩子们吃了太多的冰激凌吗？”





来爱尔兰与我共舞


年轻的阿彻太太和凯西·瓦伦丁以及科恩太太正一起坐在床上，她们一边逗着宝贝玩，一边聊着闲天。这时，门铃响了，阿彻太太嘴里一边嘟囔道：“哦，老天！”一边走到门铃呼叫器前按下了公寓大门的开门按钮，“住在一层真倒霉，”她冲着凯西和科恩太太说道，“每个人都按我家的门铃。”

当自己公寓门的门铃再次响起的时候，她把门打开，看见一位老人正站在外面的过道里。他穿着一件破旧的、黑色的长外套，四方脸上胡须花白，手里拿着一把鞋带伸了过来。

“哦，”阿彻太太说道，“哦，很抱歉，但是——”

“女士，”老人说道，“您行行好吧，每副才五美分。”

阿彻太太摇了摇头，向后退了几步，“我恐怕不需要。”她说道。

“不管怎么说，我还是要谢谢您，女士。”他说道，“您这么客气地跟我说话，您是这条街上第一位对一个贫穷的老人这么彬彬有礼的人。”

阿彻太太紧张兮兮地来回扭动着门把手，“我很抱歉。”她说道。然而，当他转身想走时，她又说：“等一下。”然后飞快地跑进了卧室，“有个老人正在卖鞋带。”她小声嘀咕道，打开了衣柜最上层的抽屉，拿出了钱包，在里面摸索地找着零钱。“一枚二十五美分的硬币。”她说道，“你们觉得可以吗？”

“完全可以。”凯西说道，“可能比他一整天挣到的都多。”她和阿彻太太的年纪差不多，还未结婚。科恩太太是一个肥胖的女人，年纪大概在五十五岁左右。她们俩也住在这栋楼里，由于宝贝孩子的缘故，她们会花大把的时间待在阿彻太太家里。

阿彻太太重新回到了公寓门口，“给您。”她边说，边把二十五美分的硬币递了过去，“我觉得每个对您那么粗暴的人都是可耻的。”

老人一开始要给她拿几副鞋带，可他的手抖得很厉害，鞋带掉到了地板上，他的身体重重地倚靠在了墙上。阿彻太太惊恐地看着他，“上帝呀！”她喊道，赶紧伸出了手。手指刚一接触到老人脏兮兮的旧外套时，她犹豫了一下，接着咬紧了嘴唇，伸出手臂坚定地揽住了老人，扶着他走进屋里，“姐妹们，”她喊道，“快来帮帮我！”

凯西跑出了卧室说道：“是你喊人了吗，简？”然后瞪大眼睛，不知所措地呆立在那儿。

“我该怎么办？”阿彻太太的手还扶着老人，站在那儿说道。老人的眼睛闭着，虽然有她的帮忙，但似乎马上就站不住了。“看在老天的分上，快点儿扶住他身子另一边。”

“把他扶到椅子之类可以坐的地方去。”凯西说道。门厅太窄了，没法让三个人一起并排进来。凯西搀着老人的另一只胳膊，侧着身子半引导着阿彻太太和他挪进了起居室。“别坐那把椅子。”阿彻太太大声喊道，“把他扶到那个旧皮椅上。”她们让老人在一把皮椅子上落座，然后直起了腰。“我们现在究竟应该怎么办？”阿彻太太问道。

“你们家有威士忌酒吗？”凯西问。

阿彻太太摇了摇头。“有一点儿葡萄酒。”她犹犹豫豫地说道。

科恩太太也来到了起居室，怀里抱着宝贝孩子。“天哪！”她叫道，“他喝醉了！”

“胡说，”凯西说道，“如果他喝醉了，我不会让简把他弄进来的。”

“留神照顾好宝宝，布兰奇。”阿彻太太说道。

“那是自然。”科恩太太说道。“我们还是回卧室吧，小乖乖，”她对着宝贝孩子说道，“我们去可爱的婴儿床上躺着，睡觉觉去喽。”

老人动了一下身子，睁开了眼睛，想努力站起来。

“您现在还是老老实实地坐在那儿吧。”凯西命令道，“这位阿彻太太要去给您拿点儿葡萄酒，您能喝葡萄酒，没错吧？”

老人抬眼望了望凯西，“谢谢！”他说道。

阿彻太太走进厨房，思忖了一会儿，她从水槽里拿出了玻璃杯，冲洗干净后，往杯里倒满了雪利酒。她端着雪利酒回到了起居室，把酒杯递给了凯西。

“我拿着酒杯喂您，还是您自己拿着喝？”凯西问老人。

“您真是太好了。”他说道，伸手去拿酒杯。当他抿着酒的时候，凯西帮他扶稳酒杯。老人啜了几口后，把酒杯推开了。

“好了，谢谢您，”他说道，“足以让我活过来了。”他试图站起身子，“谢谢了。”他对着阿彻太太说道。“也辛苦您了。”他又对着凯西谢道，“我最好还是走吧。”

“别着急起来，您现在还很虚弱，”凯西说道，“还不能冒这个险，您要明白。”

老人微笑着，“我可以冒这个险了。”他说道。

科恩太太又回到了起居室，“宝宝已经在婴儿床上了，”她说道，“而且已经睡着了。他觉得现在好些了吗？我敢打赌他刚才要么是喝醉了，要么是饿坏了，要么是哪儿出了状况。”

“当然，他出了状况，”凯西说道，想到这一点她忍不住想发火，“他是饿的，这就是他出状况的原因，简。我们真是太傻了。可怜的老先生！”她对着老人说道：“如果您不填饱肚子，阿彻太太是不会让您离开这儿的。”

阿彻太太看上去有点儿犹豫不决，“我这儿有些鸡蛋。”她说道。

“好的！”凯西说道，“就它了，鸡蛋好消化。”她对着老人说，“特别是对您有好处，因为您没吃东西有……”她犹豫了一下，“有好一阵子了。”

“先给他喝点儿不加奶的咖啡吧，”科恩太太说道，“如果你听我的建议的话，你看他的手抖得多厉害呀。”

“你神经过敏呀，”凯西坚定地说，“一小碗肉汤是他现在最需要的，而且还得非常慢地喝，直到他的胃逐渐适应再次进食。这个胃呀，”她告诉阿彻太太和科恩太太，“好长一段时间要是空的话，会收缩的。”

“我可不想给您再添麻烦了。”老人对阿彻太太说道。

“胡说，”凯西说道，“我们得看着你好好吃上一顿热乎的饭。”她拉着阿彻太太的胳膊，和她一起走出起居室进了厨房。“就做点儿鸡蛋吧，”她说道，“煎四个或五个鸡蛋吧。我随后给你拿半打来。我估计你没有培根了。我跟你说，再煎上几个土豆。哪怕是半熟的，他也不会在乎的。这些人吃东西就爱吃一堆堆的煎土豆、煎鸡蛋和——”

“还有午饭剩下的罐装无花果，”阿彻太太说道，“我想知道怎么用它们配菜。”

“我得跑回去，去看他一眼。”凯西说道，“他可能又晕倒了或者出别的什么状况了。你只需煎上那些鸡蛋和土豆就行了。如果布兰奇能腾出空，我让她出来帮你。”

阿彻太太掂量着倒出足够煮两杯的咖啡，然后把壶放到了炉子上，接着又拿出了煎锅。“凯西，”她说道，“我还是有点儿担心，如果他真是个酒鬼，我的意思是，如果吉姆听说了，家里还有宝宝，还有别的……”

“干吗这么说，简！”凯西说道，“我觉得你真应该在乡下住一段时间。女人们总是给快饿死的男人们施舍口吃的，再说你也不必告诉吉姆，布兰奇和我肯定不会说的。”

“好吧。”阿彻太太说道，“你确信他没有喝醉？”

“当我看见一个快要饿死的人，我一眼就能看出来，”凯西说道，“当一位老人站也站不住，双手不住地颤抖，看上去很奇怪的时候，那就意味着他快要饿死了，真的要饿死了。”

“噢，我的天呀！”阿彻太太喊道。她慌忙打开水槽下面的食物柜，从里面拿出了两个土豆。“你觉得两个够吗？我认为我们的确在做一件好事。”

凯西咯咯笑着，“不过是一群女童子军罢了。”她撂下这句话就打算走出厨房，可又突然像想起了什么似的停下了脚步，转过身，“你有派吗？他们总吃派。”

“可那是为晚饭准备的。”阿彻太太说道。

“呃，把它给他吧，”凯西说道，“等他走了以后，我们可以出门再去买点儿。”

趁着土豆正在煎着的时候，阿彻太太在餐桌上摆放了一个盘子、一个杯子和茶杯托，还有一副餐刀、叉子和勺子。然后，好像又事后想起了什么，她又从壁橱里拿出了碟子和一个纸袋子，把纸袋子撕成了两半，铺平在桌子上，紧接着又把碟子放了回去。她又拿出一个玻璃杯，往里面倒满了从冰箱拿出来的水瓶里的水。她切了三片面包，把它们放到了一个盘子上，然后又切了一小块黄油，把它放到盘子上的面包旁边。接着她又从壁橱的盒子里拿出了一块纸餐巾，把它放在了盘子边上，过了一会儿又把它拿起来，折成了一个三角形的形状，然后放了回去。最后，她把装着胡椒和盐的搅拌器放到了桌子上，拿出了一盒鸡蛋。她走到门前喊道：“凯西！问一下他想让鸡蛋怎样煎？”

起居室里传来一阵嘀咕声，然后凯西高声回答道：“荷包蛋只煎一面！”

阿彻太太拿出四个鸡蛋，一个接一个地把它们敲破搁到了煎锅里。当鸡蛋快好了的时候，她又喊道：“好了，姐妹们，把他带进来吧！”

科恩太太来到厨房，仔细看了看盘子里的土豆和鸡蛋，看着阿彻太太没吭声。

过了一会儿，凯西搀着老人也进来了，她把他护送到桌子边，安顿到一张椅子上坐下。“你瞧，”她说道，“现在阿彻太太给你准备好了一顿可口的、热乎的饭菜。”

老人看着阿彻太太，“我真是感激不尽。”他说道。

“看上去真不错！”凯西说道，她赞赏地朝阿彻太太点了点头。老人看着盛满鸡蛋和土豆的盘子。“现在可以好好吃上一顿了，”凯西说道，“都坐下来吧，姐妹们。我再从卧室里拿把椅子出来。”

老人拿起了盐瓶，轻轻地在鸡蛋上洒了一些盐。“看上去很好吃。”他最后说了一句。

“你自己随便吃吧，”凯西说道，她拿了把椅子回来了，“我们想看着您吃饱肚子。再给他倒上点咖啡吧，简。”

阿彻太太走到炉子前，拿起了咖啡壶。

“不用再麻烦了。”他说道。

“没关系的。”阿彻太太边说，边往老人的杯子里倒满了咖啡，然后坐在了桌子旁。老人拿起了叉子，然后又放下了，探身去拿了纸餐巾，把它认真地铺到了膝盖上。

“您叫什么名字？”凯西问道。

“奥弗莱厄蒂，女士。约翰·奥弗莱厄蒂。”

“你好，约翰，”凯西说道，“我是瓦伦丁小姐，这位女士是阿彻太太，那位是科恩太太。”

“你们好！”老人招呼道。

“我猜您一定来自那个古老的国度。”凯西说道。

“您说什么，我没听明白。”

“您是爱尔兰人，对不对？”凯西问道。

“对，女士。”老人将叉子刺进一个鸡蛋，看着蛋黄流到了盘子上。“我认识叶芝。”他突然冒出了一句。

“真的吗？”凯西把身子向前探了探说道，“让我想想——他是位作家，对吧？”

“出于慈善，来爱尔兰与我共舞。”老人吟道。他站起身，手扶着椅子背，向着阿彻太太深深地鞠了一躬。“再次感谢，女士。感谢您的慷慨。”他转过身，开始向大门走去，三个女人也起身跟在他的后面。

“可是您还没吃完呐。”科恩太太说道。

“我的胃，”老人说道，“正如这位女士刚才所说，收缩了。是的，的确是这样，”他好像还沉浸在怀旧当中，“我认识叶芝。”

在大门口，他转过身，对着阿彻太太说道：“您的善良不应该得不到回报。”他对着地板上的鞋带比画了一下。“这些，”他说道，“都给您了。出于对您好心的报答。把它们和其他两位女士分分吧。”

“但是，我没想过要——”阿彻太太开始嗫嚅。

“您务必要留下，”老人边说，边打开了房门，“一点儿小意思，但已经是我能拿出来的所有的东西了。您自己捡起来吧。”他冷不丁地又加了一句。然后，他转过身，冲着科恩太太嗤之以鼻，“我讨厌老太太们。”他蔑视地说。

“啊！”科恩太太快晕过去了。

“我可能对喝的东西很随意，”老人对着阿彻太太说道，“但我绝不会给我的客人喝那么难喝的雪利酒。我们真是两个不同世界的人呀，女士。”

“你瞧我刚跟你们说什么来着？”科恩太太说道，“我可一直在提醒你们，不是吗？”

阿彻太太眼睛盯着凯西，欲作势把老人推出大门，但他抢先一步出了门。

“来爱尔兰与我共舞。”他嘴里还在念念有词，靠在墙上向楼门挪了过去，然后打开楼门，“时间飞逝。”他的吟诵依然在耳。





我在乎的不是钱


一个阳光明媚的下午，公园里几乎挤满了人。老人们坐在长凳上，妈妈们或者闲散地坐在婴儿车的旁边，或者看着孩子们在草地上尖叫着追逐打闹。还有很多拴着皮带的狗或者在小路上来来回回地溜达，或者趴在长凳旁边。除了孩子们的叫声，听不到有人聊天，也没有什么别的噪音。

一个男人从侧门走进了公园，他在入口的不远处停下脚步，拍了拍一条狗的头，和狗的主人随口聊了几句，然后慢慢走开，似乎想找个地方坐下。他已届中年，头发稀疏，从衣着上判断，不是衣食无忧的那种人。他一边漫步，一边满怀兴致地看着公园中的人们，时而驻足去听听母亲和孩子之间的拌嘴，时而又为一群稍大一点儿的男孩子捡起皮球。有个男孩子冲他喊道：“把它扔到这儿来，先生。”并伸出双手要球。男人很笨拙地把球掷了出去，球弹跳了两次，那个男孩才一手把球捞到。男孩说了声“谢谢”，然后转过身，很轻松地把球抛出了很远，皮球越过一片草地到了另一个男孩的手上。男人在场边看了一会儿，然后又继续走了下去。最后，他停在了一条长凳前面，长凳的一边还有一个空座位，而另一边坐着一位妇女，身边还有一个婴儿车。“我可以坐在这儿吗？”他问道。她抬头看了他一眼，答道：“可以。”男人一屁股坐了下去。他吁了口气，静静地坐了一小会儿，然后伸手从口袋里掏出一根香烟。

女人有点儿恼怒地看着他，转过脸去。宝宝只穿着尿布，正趴在婴儿车里熟睡。宝宝的后背是棕色的，裹着尿布的地方是显眼的白色。女人不知疲倦地来来回回摇晃着婴儿车。

“吸烟会影响到孩子吗？”男人问道。

“我刚把她哄着。”女人说道，“一丁点儿动静都会惊醒她。”

男人往前弯了一下腰，把香烟扔在地上，并踩在了脚下。“她看上去是个可爱、健康的孩子。”他说道。

女人微笑着，“她只有六个月大，”她说道，“甚至还从未得过感冒。”

“这孩子可真棒，”男人说道，“你看周围，很多孩子看上去很苍白。”

“他们都不太健康，”女人说道，“公园里一些孩子确实不健康。”

“也难为这些在城里生活的孩子了。”

“如果他们有什么病的话，他们的母亲不应该把他们带到公园里来，免得其他的孩子也感染上。”女人说道。

当她正在说话的时候，男人一直在用手指摩挲着皮夹子，心不在焉似的把里面的纸片搓来搓去，如同洗牌一般。此时，他抽出了一张——从杂志上剪下来的纸片。“想看看我的小女儿吗？”他问道。

女人欲伸出那只没有摇晃婴儿车的手去接纸片，“当然，”她说道，“从你说话的方式我能看出你应该是当了父亲了。”

纸片上是一个大约六岁的金发小女孩，有着一张漂亮的、成年人一样的脸，还画着浓妆。“她很可爱，”女人说道，“她长着一张甜美的脸。”

“她是个很不错的孩子，”男人说道，他迟疑了一下，“知道她是谁吗？”他终于忍不住问道。

女人摇了摇头。

“她现在的名字叫安吉拉·福斯特。”

“这个名字我当然知道，”女人说道，“她演了很多电影！”

“没错。”男人拿起纸片，疼爱地看着，“她原来姓马丁——那是我的姓。她妈妈改了它，安吉拉·马丁这个名字对于演员来说不怎么响亮。”他说道。

“多么幸运的小姑娘呀！”女人一边说着，一边伸手去调整了一下婴儿车的顶篷，“演了那么多电影！”

“有朝一日她会成为第二个秀兰·邓波儿，”男人说道，“她有天赋——在所有事上。”

“你一定很为她骄傲。”

“我跟你说，”男人开始字斟句酌，“我为她骄傲，那是当然。但我在乎的不是钱，她现在能挣很多的钱，我并不因此而妒忌她。是这样的，在她的母亲把她带到好莱坞之前，我总是到处领她上舞蹈课、声乐课和表演课，有时忙到很晚，舞蹈课之后还有朗诵课。直到现在我才知道，那时我还没有足够的先见之明看出这个孩子有天分。”

“这很难看出来，”女人说道，“所有的孩子天生都有节奏感，甚至在六个月大的时候——”

“我不在乎钱，”男人又重复了一遍，“我认为一个六岁大的孩子不应该养活她的父亲。”

“呃，可是好运连连总是和钱相关。”女人说道。

“我在一本电影杂志上看到了一篇有关她的文章，”男人继续说道，“说她五岁了，但是她现在应该六岁了。而且她还收到了很多影迷的来信。”

“真的吗？”女人说道。

“我也想过给她写封信，管她要一张照片，”男人说道，“我是她的父亲呀。”

“我确信您很是为她骄傲。”女人说道。他又把手伸进口袋想掏香烟，她皱着眉头，摇了摇头。男人站了起来。

“我抽完这根烟，正好能散完步。”他说道。他对着女人微笑着，俯身看了一会儿婴儿车。“多么漂亮的宝贝呀。”他说道。他微微向女人鞠躬，快步走上了小路。

当这个男人走到下一个转弯处，开始更加放慢了脚步。一个小男孩正在长凳那儿学走路，踉踉跄跄走过来抓住了他的裤腿。男人说道：“你要去哪儿呀，小冠军？”他帮着幼儿转过身子，孩子开始走回他妈妈待的地方。男人停下来看了一会儿棋盘游戏，然后又继续散步。一会儿后，又停了下来，帮助一个大约两岁的小女孩推着她的学步车绕过了一个比较困难的拐弯的地方。男人称小女孩“小甜甜”。女孩的母亲就站在附近，向他表示了感谢，男人跟她说道：“多可爱的小姑娘呀。”小女孩的母亲微笑着走了过来，在小女孩推着车的时候，一边拉着小女孩，一边跟她说着话。

这个男人绕了一大圈，现在又回到了他出发的地方。当他路过那群正在玩球的男孩的时候，他看见球撞到了一棵树上，然后向他所处的位置弹了过来。他笨手笨脚地把球捡到，拿在手里向孩子们走去。他们正不耐烦地等着他把球扔回来。他抬脚迈过一个很低的栏杆，把球交给了离他最近的男孩，他抱歉地笑着说道：“我有点老胳膊老腿了。”

“谢了。”男孩说道。他把球一掷，男孩子们开始四散跑开了。其中一个男孩抢到了球，把它传给了另一个男孩。这个男人又开口了，“小伙子。”离他最近的那个男孩转过身来。男人掏出了皮夹子说道：“想知道这是谁吗？”他拿出一张从报纸上剪下的小纸片作势要递给这个男孩。

男孩扭头看了一眼他的朋友们，然后走到男人的身边，“是的。”他边说边低头看着小纸片，但是没有打算把它接过来。“是尼基·洛佩兹，中量级挑战者。”

当这个男人故意大声说话的时候，附近的好几个男孩也都转过了脸，现在他们都慢慢地凑了过来。“是尼基·洛佩兹，”其中一个男孩说道，“大伙儿来看尼基·洛佩兹。”男人把纸片递给了他，他看着照片很在行地说道：“这个家伙可能打了。”

“他相当棒。”另一个男孩也附和道，他们把纸片轮流传着看。

“我过去是尼基的经纪人，”男人说道，注意到孩子们的小脑袋都慢慢地转向了他。“是的，”他回忆似的说道，“我过去管理着尼基，直到大财团把他从我身边夺走。”他环视了一下男孩子们，然后继续说道：“我并不在乎钱，你们知道，但是我真的不愿意失去那个小伙子。”





我知道我爱着谁


凯瑟琳·文森特在纽约的一套两居室的公寓里开始了她的新生活。她出生于布法罗的一个牧师家庭，这种生活的改变对于她而言，可能是个悲剧。当魔鬼提醒威廉·文森特结婚时，并没有提醒威廉要进一步搞清楚他妻子生的究竟是男孩还是女孩，或者就是凯瑟琳（是最后根据威廉母亲的名字而起的名）这样的女孩，瘦弱、胆怯，有着一双蓝汪汪的眼睛，降临人世时，发出一声尖声哭喊。

凯瑟琳二十三岁时，发现她父亲本来更想要一个儿子，如果他不得不要孩子的话。这时的她仍然瘦弱，一双湛蓝的眼睛，好像很容易受到惊吓，对于绘画有那么点儿天赋。她最终独自一人去了纽约，在那段日子里，她自力更生，几乎已经忘记了她的父亲，还有奄奄一息的母亲。

威廉·文森特是个矮胖的男人，蓄着浓密的胡子，他觉着这样会让他看上去更像一家之主。在结婚前不久，他就已经成为一名牧师了，因为他那时有一种模模糊糊的想法，只有这样，他才能成为正确的、有德行的人，才能更容易地保住他的权威。他不惧内，他的妻子是一位并不富裕的杂货店店主的独生女，但他却害怕隔壁的女人，还有银行中活跃的年轻人，甚至害怕肉店送货的伙计。因为他会在讨账时扮着鬼脸，口无遮拦，但又无法受到指摘。威廉·文森特把他的女儿看作多余的负担，犹如一个陷阱，是上帝意志错误的表达。他认为他的妻子和蔼可亲，但她的身份只是个家庭主妇。实际上，他觉着唯一可以亲近的人是上帝，而上帝在厚厚的《圣经》里，在沉闷的祷告词中，在破败的教堂里和在廉价的赞美诗中。凯瑟琳很小就习惯听见她的父亲在小书桌或者笨重的餐桌的一头说：“在上帝或者我的眼中，你的所作所为是符合要求的吗？”

凯瑟琳离开家以后，甚至就在火车驶出车站的那一刻，她就把父母都忘在脑后了。只是在后来，她每周要往家里写一封信。（“我现在很好，我的感冒也终于好了。工作也不错，他们跟我说，我请三天病假没什么关系。但我想我可能有一段时间不能请假了，所以短时间内就不能回家了。”）她父亲在书桌那头的问话，母亲怯生生的笑声，在脑海中被她毅然决然地连根拔除了。在她二十三岁时，她的母亲去世了。

医生在房间里，凯瑟琳在公寓外面的门厅里等着，在她母亲弥留的最后几分钟里医生陪在她母亲的身边，“她什么话也没留下，”医生说道，“她走得很平静，文森特小姐。”

“好的。”凯瑟琳低声说道。她的母亲早就开始挣扎在死亡线上了，并在春天终于咽了气。明年她还想买一件皮毛大衣呢，这下子泡了汤。“下一步我应该做些什么安排？”她茫然若失地挥了一下手，向医生问道，“比如葬礼，以及其他诸如此类的事情？”

医生看了凯瑟琳一会儿，“我会在这些事上帮助你的。”他说道。

凯瑟琳用柔和的声音对前来悼念又不太熟识的人说话，他们赞扬她的勇敢，或者轻拍她的手，宽慰她说她的母亲现在应该更幸福。“她现在和你亲爱的父亲在一起了，”公寓楼的一位保洁员阿姨对凯瑟琳说，“他们最后又可以团圆了。”

葬礼结束了，凯瑟琳送走了她的母亲。凯瑟琳又把公寓恢复成了她母亲过来跟她一起生活之前的样子。多余的床已经搬出去了，小桌子又搬回了窗户旁。她花了五美元给扶手椅配了一个新坐垫，让人把窗帘也洗干净了。她母亲唯一留下的东西是一件旧行李箱，里面充满了她母亲的记忆和希望。卖掉布法罗老家的家具等杂物所获得的少量的钱已经支付了葬礼的花销，凯瑟琳用她的工资和省下的准备买皮大衣的钱支付了医生的费用和药费，她跟大楼的负责人商量把她母亲的行李箱保存到地下室的储物间里。在行李箱被搬走的头一天傍晚，她打开了它，确保里面放了樟脑球，并拿出了她可能会用到的东西。最后，像是要恪尽儿女之道，她开始回忆起了父母生活的点滴。

有那么一两分钟，对父母的回忆夹杂在了其他如潮水般涌来的记忆当中。干瘦的老师一把将画从凯瑟琳手中抓过去，大声吼道：“我早就应该想到，这种笨蛋根本完不成作业。”回忆中又浮现出一个名叫弗雷迪的小男孩，用粉笔在一个篱笆上写着什么，然后又慌乱地擦掉，待他跑开之后，能够看出他一直焦急地想擦去，空洞而暧昧的文字——“凯瑟琳爱弗雷迪。”接着，又想到她父亲问她的话，“凯瑟琳，你们学校的男孩和女孩们在一起时会谈论不好的事情吗？”再接着，又回忆起一或两个开过的派对，以及那件她母亲给她做的印花雪纺绸裙子。还有她父亲让她去邻居家要回她借给同学的一枚五分硬币。再有她母亲的话，“亲爱的，我觉得你父亲不怎么喜欢那个叫简的小女孩。如果我去跟她交涉的话，我会把话说得很婉转……”

她自己还记得，自己曾梦想有一天会衣锦还乡，成了著名的艺术家，带着一名秘书，手捧一大束栀子花，从火车上走下来时，一大堆人在等着她的亲笔签名。弗雷迪也在那儿，拼命往前挤着，凯瑟琳稍稍一侧身，说道：“我想你一定是搞错了，我对一个名叫弗雷迪的家伙一点儿也不上心。”凯瑟琳在班里个头最高，也很瘦，在课间休息的时候跟其他在班里不怎么受欢迎的女生说：“我父亲不愿意我和男孩子们约会。他们热衷的那些事儿，你是知道的。”放学以后，她和一位年轻漂亮的女老师待在一起的时候，她问道：“你难道不喜欢玛丽·罗伯茨·莱因哈特的作品吗，亨伍德小姐？我觉得她是个特别棒的作家。”

学校里的女生把凯瑟琳叫作“凯蒂”，而老师和她的父母则叫她“凯瑟琳”，后来，办公室的女同事们把她叫作“卡迪”或者“吉蒂”。但那时艾伦称她为“凯拉”，甚至在一张他写给凯瑟琳的小纸条上，开始用“怪凯拉”来称呼她。在布法罗的时候，凯瑟琳手里攥着艾伦的纸条，晚上坐在打开的窗户旁，抬头望着满天的星星。她的父亲在楼下充满怀疑地走来走去。而在纽约，她眼睁睁看着母亲离世。

“发火的凯蒂，就像支风笛。”凯瑟琳清楚地记得校园中传诵的顺口溜，还有从一张书桌传到另一张书桌的小纸条。她把脚搭在已故母亲的行李箱上，能够感觉到椅子软垫靠背抵着她肩膀。她看着公寓窗户下面车水马龙的大街，明白自己第二天还得上班挣钱时，过去的一切在她的脑海中翻滚。“发火的凯蒂，就像支风笛。”凯瑟琳舒心地微笑着，她记得在过去曾参加过的某个派对上，大家玩过一个亲吻游戏。那是文法学校的毕业派对。人群后面的凯瑟琳，出人意料地被人推上前去亲吻一个男孩（哪个男孩来着？她现在想弄明白，难道又是弗雷迪？），而那个男孩子边向后退，边说道：“嘿，听着，别闹。”而凯瑟琳则不知所措地站在那儿。接着就听见有人喊道：“凯蒂的爸爸不让她亲吻男孩子。”凯瑟琳想为她父亲辩护，于是开始否认，后来她意识到如果承认了绝对会更糟糕，那个男孩子已经从她身边跑开了。事后，她跟那些在休息的时间同样不受欢迎的女生说：“我父亲不会让我参加玩那种游戏的派对了。”或者“如果我父亲抓住我正在做那些疯女孩所做的事，我就死定了！”

她后来上了商科学院，因为她的父亲需要有人帮他整理有朝一日他会写下的大量布道经书或经文，在他的观念中，有一个秘书才是成功的标志。商科学院的一切她并不陌生。漂亮的女生们都上了大学，凯瑟琳和剩下的、傻乎乎的、或胖或瘦的女生在一起，她们也都很有活力，曾经迷恋过男教师。学校中的男生大多数都很认真和勤奋，他们会在大厅里停下脚步，询问凯瑟琳对打字测验怎么看，还有她是否已经记下了今天的作业。艾伦是在学期中间转学来的，他当时穿着一件黄色的运动衫，突然出现在打字课上，教室里的学生悄声坐在打字机旁，观察着他。他站在那儿，又瘦又小，但是仪态很优雅，面带微笑。

“我立刻就爱上了你，”后来凯瑟琳告诉他，“我不知道是什么打动了我。”

有一次凯瑟琳脑袋一热，几乎是脱口而出地问她母亲，“妈妈，你爱我爸爸吗？”

“凯瑟琳，”她的母亲叫道，洗碗的手一动不动了，“出什么事了，亲爱的？”

在凯瑟琳的生活中，高中阶段是最难熬的。当别的女生穿着毛衣或者鹿皮夹克，收集明星签名时，凯瑟琳穿着款式难看的羊毛外套像个丑小鸭似的坐在教室里。有一次，用父亲从他兄弟那儿借来的钱，母亲给凯瑟琳买了一件深绿色的毛衣和短裙。可那天早上，当凯瑟琳穿着这身衣服上学时，一个女生说道：“瞧你穿的什么呀，买的清仓甩卖的处理品吧？”另一个女生也添油加醋地说：“你们瞧瞧凯蒂，穿着自己织的毛衣。”多年以后的一天，凯瑟琳胳膊支在桌子上，她的香烟的烟飘进眼睛里，她对艾伦说道：“我不喜欢衣服，一点儿也不喜欢。我觉得每个人对穿衣太过大惊小怪了，我觉得人体本身就很完美。”当穿着高跟鞋、梳着鬈发的女孩子们去参加大学二年级的舞会和各种高档次舞会的时候，凯瑟琳和她的三四位朋友也在举办自己的小型女性派对，她们喝着可可饮料，吃着小点心，聊着天，“说实话，凯蒂，你一定会很迷人的。如果你能烫个发，再稍微化化妆的话。”而凯瑟琳则红着脸说道：“要是那样的话，我父亲一定会杀了我的。”“你的皮肤真好，可我的皮肤总是起痘。”“不，不是这样的，”凯瑟琳说，或者好言相慰，“你不胖，真的。说实话，我就希望自己长得跟你一样。”

上高中一年级的时候，在凯瑟琳身上发生了一件可怕的事情。她的一位朋友被引荐参加一场演出，演出的地点在美国退伍军人协会当地的分会，剧目是《天皇》。一些协会成员的女儿要参演，她们穿着长袍，化着妆，有机会展示一下表演才能。凯瑟琳的朋友名叫埃德娜，在演出的第三和最后一个晚上，埃德娜成功地说服演出方邀请凯瑟琳来参加演出，替换一个生了病的女孩。在七点钟的时候，凯瑟琳穿着她母亲蓝色的绉绸长裙到了，衣服极不合身，白色透明的褶边紧绷绷地箍在双肩上，埃德娜在礼堂的大厅里迎着她。文森特太太是和凯瑟琳一起坐有轨电车来的，对埃德娜嘱咐道：“你一定要护送凯瑟琳安全到家，好吗？”

“我爸妈会开车把她送回家的。”埃德娜保证道。文森特太太和凯瑟琳吻别后，用怀疑的目光扫视了一下礼堂，然后出了大厅，搭上有轨电车回家了。“我看上去怎么样？”埃德娜问道，“看看我的样子。”她用双手拉着裙摆，而凯瑟琳素面朝天，头发直直的，才惊恐地意识到埃德娜的打扮比自己要可爱得多。“我梳了个波浪卷，”埃德娜说道，“而且还抹了口红。”直到那时凯瑟琳才认识到，在女孩子的一生中，至少有一次或者两次，在某个夜晚，她应该看上去要美丽动人。她还不能习惯于被人看作丑女，所以愿意等待，直到一两个小时以后，她的美丽能真正绽放。“你看上去棒极了，”凯瑟琳虚弱地说道，“我看上去怎么样？”她把外套敞开，埃德娜说道：“你看上去也很漂亮，听着，演出完成后，我们一起去参加庆祝派对。”

演出之后，凯瑟琳又待了很长时间观察埃德娜，看着她波浪般的鬈发舒展开来，看着她拖着宽大的裙摆走来走去，看着她在一位壮实的中年男子怀中梦幻般地翩翩起舞；这位男子是合唱队的成员，他在埃德娜耳畔轻声低语时，发出了咯咯的坏笑，而埃德娜翻着白眼，轻轻地扇了他一耳光。当时她的父母就坐在房间的一边，显得既疲倦又有些自豪，热情地和熟人们打着招呼。

凯瑟琳是自己走回家的，她一路上双手向上提着蓝色的泡泡纱长裙，不怕别人注意的目光。“这是我见过的最难看的衣服。”她自言自语地说，“爸爸会气得要死。”可在离家还不到一个街区的时候，她觉得自己是个魅力四射的美女，正走在一个花园里，她的长裙轻盈而优雅地滑过地面，身边围满了索要她签名的人。“拜托，”她一边摇着羽扇，一边柔声说道，“拜托，不要赞扬我的美貌了……你知道，我真的谈不上漂亮。”一阵叽叽喳喳的抗议声淹没了她的声音，她不再坚持，悄悄地开口笑了。

她的父亲不许她再跟埃德娜说话了，而且还给埃德娜的父亲写了一封措辞严厉的信件，但没有得到任何回音。她的母亲让人把蓝色的长裙洗了，因为褶边处都弄脏了。

“我认为普罗大众在看到美时，是无法认识到美的，”凯瑟琳后来跟艾伦说道，事情已经过去很多年了，“我认为你们这些凡夫俗子是在践踏美，因为美对你们来说是高不可攀的。”




“你总是不知道感恩，真是被我惯坏了。”她母亲一边费劲地在床上挪动着身子，一边唠叨着。

“你现在全靠我养着，不是吗？”凯瑟琳冷冰冰地回敬道，“你吃我的，喝我的，不是吗？医生一周两次来给你看病，难道不是吗？”

“你身上从来没有一丝一毫的感情。”母亲说道。

“我身上有让我照顾你、供你吃喝的感情。”凯瑟琳反驳道。

她的母亲拽了拽毯子，她的手瘦削而无力。“我不知道我做了什么孽生出你这样的女儿。”

“一定是你违背了上帝的意愿。”凯瑟琳说道。她斜靠在小厨房的门边，正准备去给她母亲煮燕麦粥。她在办公室度过了冗长而又郁闷的一天。已经快到冬天了（如果她母亲没有来的话，她本来可以买一件稍微便宜点儿的皮毛大衣过冬），可她母亲没有一点儿好转或病情恶化的迹象。她已经二十三岁了，可还整天浑浑噩噩的，没有谈恋爱，事业也无起色，生活如一潭死水。

“要是你可怜的父亲听到你说这样的话……”

“我可怜的父亲什么也听不到了，”凯瑟琳说道，“而且我也很开心能这样。”

她母亲想尽力在床上坐起来，同时用眼中的泪水软化凯瑟琳的态度。“你父亲一直对你很好，凯瑟琳。你不应该说出那样恶毒的话来。”

凯瑟琳笑出了声，走进了厨房。

凯瑟琳十二岁时，她母亲想给她办一个派对。她在十元店买了一些小邀请卡，还有一堆纸帽子，盛糖果的小篮子等。她还买了冰激凌，订了一个蛋糕，买了玩给驴子贴尾巴游戏的道具。“准备这些东西花费不多，也就三美元左右的样子，”她告诉凯瑟琳的父亲，“钱是我从这周的生活费里出的。”

“我看不出有什么必要给凯瑟琳这么铺张浪费，”她的父亲皱着眉头说道，“作为牧师的女儿，在她的生活中就不该有这种世俗的、愚蠢的玩意儿。”

“这孩子以前从来没有过自己的派对。”她的母亲态度很坚决地说道。

“我不想开派对。”凯瑟琳自言自语地说，上楼回到了自己的房间，躺到了床上。“我不想让别的孩子来我们家。”她的母亲发出了小邀请卡（凯瑟琳·文森特，周四，8月24号，2点—5点），几乎所有受到邀请的十二岁的孩子都来了。

派对办得很惨淡。凯瑟琳穿着旧裙子，只是在领口和袖口新镶了边，她的母亲穿着她去教堂时才穿的衣服在门口迎接着客人，把他们迎进客厅并安排大家坐下。客厅的桌子上放着很多盛着糖果的小篮子，小客人们一次拿一块糖吃，玩着贴驴尾巴的游戏，只是因为文森特太太希望他们玩，然后就安静地坐在那里，直到其中一个孩子想起来什么似的说她现在应该回家了。“可是你还没吃冰激凌呢，”凯瑟琳的母亲开心地喊道，“吃了冰激凌再走。”凯瑟琳后来对这次派对的记忆都是关于她母亲的：母亲风风火火地忙活，从一处走到另一处时，大声笑着，还时不时哼着小曲。凯瑟琳的旧衣服在一群穿着盛装的孩子中间，显得很扎眼。她的母亲一直在说个不停，“哦，你看上去很漂亮！”还有“你一定是凯瑟琳班上最聪明的小姑娘。”

后来，有一次在吃晚饭时，她母亲不无得意地问道：“亲爱的，你觉得派对怎么样，喜欢吗？”

“我跟你说他们都是在做样子，”凯瑟琳冷冷地回答道，“他们都不喜欢我。”

“如果凯瑟琳的朋友们不知道如何对她的妈妈有礼貌的话，她就无权想办什么派对。”文森特先生边说，边埋头消灭一大盘烤肝和培根。“你累个臭死，又花了那么多钱买东西，可她并不买账。”

“还记得你给我办的那个派对吗？”凯瑟琳对正躺在床上的母亲说道，“你还记得你死乞白赖要办的那个糟糕的派对吗？”

“你真是个忘恩负义的闺女，”她的母亲说道，她在毯子底下挪了挪身子，“你一直是个冷血的、没良心的孩子。”

在凯瑟琳大概十四岁的时候，有一天她的母亲走进她的卧室，当时凯瑟琳正在清理衣柜。母亲坐在床边，对着凯瑟琳的后背说：“你父亲想让我跟你谈谈，凯瑟琳。”

凯瑟琳愣了一下，然后继续叠着手帕和围巾。“他想让你跟我谈什么？”

“他觉得是时候让我找你谈谈了。”母亲严肃地说道。

母亲一直在说着，一会儿道歉，一会儿又没话找话，凯瑟琳坐在地板上，把一条围巾一会儿叠上，一会儿又打开。“学校的女生们一直在谈这种事吗？”母亲问道。

“一直在谈。”凯瑟琳答道。

“你一定不要听，”母亲急切地说道，“我和你父亲准备跟你普及一下这方面的知识，学校的女生们什么都不懂。凯瑟琳，我想让你答应我，除了你父母不要跟任何人谈论这些事情。”

“如果我有问题，我会去问父亲的。”凯瑟琳应道。

“也别笑话你的父母亲啊。”她母亲说道。

凯瑟琳转过身，看着母亲。“你说完了吗？”她母亲点了点头。“那么，这个话题我们以后就不要再谈了。”凯瑟琳说，“我不想再谈它了，永远。”

“我也永远不会再谈了，”母亲生气地说道，“很难跟你沟通了，年轻的小姐，我再也不会跟你谈敏感的话题了。”

“告诉我爸，你已经和我谈了。”凯瑟琳在母亲走出房门时，冲着她的背影喊道。

“你爱我的父亲吗？”凯瑟琳向卧床的母亲发问道，“你爱过我的父亲吗，妈妈？”

“你从来没爱过他，”母亲在枕头上转了一下头，“你是个忘恩负义的孩子。”

“你嫁给他时，觉得自己会幸福吗？”

“他是一个好丈夫，”母亲说道，“他也尽了最大努力去做一个好父亲，可你只想惹麻烦，你这一辈子都是这样。”




凯瑟琳十九岁了，她坐在座位的边上，双手并排放在卡座的桌子上，书搁在旁边，眼睛紧盯着雅间的房门。如果有人进来了，就这一次，豁出去了，她思忖着。要是某个女孩看见了我，也就这一次了。

“你看上去太严肃了，”艾伦说道，“喝咖啡？”

“好的，请便。”凯瑟琳说道。

“你瞧，”艾伦说道，“我请你出来和我一起喝咖啡，是因为我觉得你会有兴趣跟我聊聊天，你不能只坐在那儿一句话也不说呀。”凯瑟琳抬起了头，看见他正在微笑。“说点儿有趣的事儿吧。”他说道。

在侍者过来，艾伦点咖啡的时候，她思索了好一会儿，可当侍者走开，艾伦有礼貌地转过脸面向她时，她只是摇了摇头，微笑着。

“那么还是让我来开个头吧，”艾伦说道，“昨天你拿了本什么书？”

“你看见我了？”凯瑟琳未加思索地问道。

“我当然看见你了，”艾伦说道，“我每天都注意你。有时你会穿一件绿色的毛衣。”

凯瑟琳觉得这时她得快点儿、抓紧时间开口了，因为脑子里现成的话会稍纵即逝。“我一点儿也不喜欢衣服，”她说，“我觉得每个人对穿衣这件事都搞得大惊小怪的，我认为人体本身是完美的。”

艾伦有点儿瞠目结舌了，“什么！”他说道。

凯瑟琳回想了一下刚才自己所说的话，有点儿脸红了。“我没打算把话说得那么粗俗。”她解释道。

另一次，凯瑟琳已经明白如何稍微轻松地回答问题了。艾伦问她：“为什么我们不到十元店去给你买个口红呀？”

“那样的话，我父亲会杀了我的。”凯瑟琳答道。

“你只需上学的时候抹口红，”艾伦说道，“我想让我的姑娘看上去更漂亮。”

从那以后，凯瑟琳脑子里反复琢磨着“我的姑娘”的含义。她买了口红、香粉、胭脂还有指甲油，每天上午上课前，她都会在女厕所里很不熟练地化妆，而每天下午和艾伦分手以后，又会把妆卸掉。她的父亲一直被蒙在鼓里，她把这些化妆品偷偷放在手提包中的一个小盒子里，而且以防万一被发现，她还编好了故事（“杰瑞的家长也不喜欢她化妆，但是她偏偏喜欢，所以她求我帮她保管这些东西——”）。

艾伦喜欢坐着的时候嘴里斜叼着烟卷，说话的时候眯缝着眼睛，让烟雾从眼角上方飘过。他咧嘴坏笑的次数比凯瑟琳知道的任何人的次数都多，她一度曾想他看上去很是邪恶，并把这种想法告诉了他。他冲她坏笑着，浓雾弥漫了他的眼。

“魔鬼是唯一真正的神灵。”他说道。

还有一次，凯瑟琳的父亲在吃晚饭的餐桌上突然说了一番话，把凯瑟琳吓得不轻。“你不是整天在跟着一个小伙子瞎跑吧，凯瑟琳？”

“凯瑟琳？”她的母亲也追问道。

“今天下午我正跟布莱克先生谈一件正事，”父亲干巴巴地说道，“他提到，他看见过你在商校外和一个年轻人走在一起，但是他不认识这个小伙子。”

“可能是我们的一个老师，”凯瑟琳清了清嗓子说道，“我也许在问他作业的事。”

“我可不想让我的女儿和一个她自己都羞于引见给父母的年轻人交往。”父亲说道。

“妈妈和爸爸对你可是充分信任的哟。”母亲说道。

“说的可能是哈雷先生，我们的打字课老师，”凯瑟琳说道，“我问他关于作业的事来着。我们在大厅里遇见，边走边谈，就走出了校门。我把作业做错了，就咨询一下他怎么弥补一下。”

“你当时应该告诉他见他的鬼去。”后来凯瑟琳告诉艾伦这件事时，他恶狠狠地说。

“有朝一日我会的。”凯瑟琳轻声说道。

“是的，亲爱的老爸，”艾伦用高音说道，“我正在和一个小伙子交往，而且我绝对羞于引见给你，因为他是个小偷和杀人犯，他还强奸了一个年轻的姑娘，甚至我妈妈和他在一起都不会安全的。”

凯瑟琳无助地摇着头，“他会死的，”她喃喃地说道，“他会气死的。”

当艾伦和文森特夫妇见面的时候，他表现得倒是彬彬有礼，凯瑟琳有一阵子甚至觉得事情似乎会平安无事地过去。有一天，艾伦一如既往地陪着她放学回家，她也很适宜地邀请他到家里坐坐。她的父母正坐在客厅里，看着艾伦和凯瑟琳走了进来。凯瑟琳说道：“爸爸、妈妈，这位是艾伦，我在学校里的一个朋友。”她的父亲走上前来，握住艾伦的手。“很高兴见到你，小伙子。”他说道。

“您好！”艾伦站在凯瑟琳的身边，身着黄色毛衣，很休闲。

“艾伦也在上学。”凯瑟琳对母亲说道。

“你觉得你们学校怎么样？”凯瑟琳的母亲问道。

聊天进行得很顺畅，没有什么冷场的时候。他们坐下来，凯瑟琳的目光和艾伦的目光碰到了一起，艾伦微笑着，她也冲他微微一笑，随后才意识到她的父母还安静地坐在那里。艾伦侃侃而谈，“您看凯拉的双手，文森特太太。它们就像白色岸边的白色浪花，它们抚摸自己的脸，就像白色蝴蝶拂面。”

当天晚上，凯瑟琳在吃晚饭的时候和父亲照了面，父亲的脸上挂着一种既不满意又有点无可奈何的表情，倒是在她的意料之中。他见了凯瑟琳马上说道：“我不太了解那个年轻人。”他又沉思了好一会儿，“你妈妈和我一直在谈论他。”

“作为你的朋友，在某种程度上似乎应该更好一点儿，”她的母亲急切地补充道，“就你的背景来看。”

“在我看来，他似乎不是太合适，”她的父亲说道，“不是很合适。”

“我们再想法攒点儿钱，”她的母亲说道，“看看是否能再给你买身衣服，既知性，又足够漂亮，能穿着去参加各种派对。”

凯瑟琳坐在窗户边，地板上她母亲的行李箱还大敞着，她手里拿着已经发黄的成绩单（“英语B-，历史D，地理D”）。好像是为了向母亲泄愤，凯瑟琳又想起了艾伦。后来威廉·文森特和他妻子本身就不怎么敏锐的眼睛不再盯着她了，也许是因为至少她对他们的问题（“凯瑟琳，你是不是一直在看——”）不再感到紧张了，她一把前门打开，他们就会变得突然安静起来。凯瑟琳走到小松木盒子旁边，她在盒子里珍藏着最为秘密的宝藏，每一次她都会拿起艾伦写给她的唯一一封信。盒子里还有一条颜色鲜亮的棉布手帕，一条失去光泽的银质吊饰手链。在她搬到纽约的多年里，她从一家夜总会收集了一个火柴纸夹，一张打印的信件，上面写着：“我们感谢您的投稿，但很遗憾我们无法采用。”随信附着凯瑟琳寄给一家杂志社的印象派风格的水彩画。她之所以还保留着它是因为那个字眼“遗憾”，信封上有她的名字，信是杂志社的某个编辑写给她的。这位编辑可能是个才华横溢的人物，对某些作家都直呼其名，坐在铬金属作栏杆的办公室内，上下班走在与凯瑟琳所走的不同的街道上，而凯瑟琳要每天从她位于西十二街的公寓去华尔街的公司做打字员的工作。可能艾伦此时也正坐在铬金属作栏杆的办公室里，他每天快步走过橱窗明亮的商场，也可能坐在出租车上路过，对着某个人微笑，突然觉得好玩似的张口说道：“那是凯瑟琳吗？我从前爱过的一个女孩，名叫凯瑟琳……”





美丽陌生人


刚开始有那种隐隐约约的陌生感是在火车站，她带着两个孩子——儿子小约翰和小女儿——来车站接自己的丈夫。他从波士顿出差回来。在家时她莫名其妙地老是担心会迟到，所以在火车到达前的半个多小时就让孩子们穿戴整齐，安顿他们坐进汽车，从家里出发了。在经过一个星期的别离之后，她似乎对见到自己的丈夫并不感到急切。当然，他们不得不在火车站耐心地等待，没完没了地等待上演一场温馨的团圆：妻子拥抱丈夫，孩子拥抱父亲。可事与愿违，实际上演成了不合时宜和蹩脚的一幕：小约翰的头发乱糟糟的，一副闷闷不乐的样子；小女儿也很焦躁，一边用力拽着自己粉色的帽子和精致的蕾丝边的裙子，一边哭喊着。火车终于到了，就在两个熊孩子闹腾的当口，火车正点进了站。玛格丽特把宝贝女儿的帽子丝带系紧，小约翰正横跨在汽车座椅的后背上。他们手脚并用地爬出了小汽车，又被火车的轰鸣吓得缩手缩脚，不知所措。

约翰·斯尼尔站在车厢门口挥舞着手，不像他的妻子和孩子们，他看上去为这次归来做了充分的准备，似乎已经做了精心安排确保这次相见至少不是那么纠结。事实上，他站在车厢门口热诚地挥着手，大概已经有半个小时之久了，因为他要确保让他们相信他的手一直是挥着的，但他的手并没有抬得很高，好像并非在过度强调再次见到他们时的兴高采烈。

他的妻子有种时空错乱的奇怪感觉，当她此时此刻站在月台上，怀抱着宝贝女儿，小约翰紧挨在她身边，恍惚间她搞不清楚他是出差回家，还是他们站在这儿来送他。在他离开前，他们一直在争吵，在他不在的这一周里，她决定要彻底忘记他在家时自己感觉的恐惧和所受的伤害，也正好利用这段时间好好思考一下。她无时无刻不在告诫自己：在约翰离家的这段时间里，我要找回原来的自己。现在，直到最后她也没能确定这是一场迎接还是一场送别，这使她又觉得恐惧起来，一阵无法忍受的紧张感涌上了心头。不能这样，她心想，要相信自己，不能自欺欺人。当他走下车厢门口的台阶向他们走来时，她微笑着，把宝贝女儿紧紧抱在怀中，让孩子小身子的温暖传递给她，让她有勇气在微笑中带上真正的温柔。

不能这样，她心想，她的微笑变得更加真诚，在他走近她时，她大声招呼他。她感到很奇怪，当他伸出手臂拥抱着她和孩子时，她亲吻着他，可怀里的孩子一边大声哭喊，一边拼命往她怀里扎。周围走动的旅客都皱起了眉头，小孩子小脚乱踢着，尖声叫着：“不，不，不。”

“这是怎么跟爸爸打招呼呢！”玛格丽特说道，她像是逗孩子似的摇了摇她，但是心中还是暗地里感激孩子移情般的支持。约翰转向了小约翰，把他举了起来，小约翰一边乱踢乱蹬着，一边忍不住大声笑着。“爸爸，爸爸。”小约翰叫喊着，而宝贝女儿在哭喊着：“不，不。”

因为没人能哄住不停哭喊的小女儿，他们赶紧转过身，逃命似的奔向了小汽车。当小女儿被放进了车里的粉色婴儿座里，小约翰也安静了下来，在女婴的身边拿着另一支棒棒糖舔着。车上本来应该有的嘘寒问暖很快被吓人的安静所填满。在玛格丽特哄孩子的时候，约翰坐到了司机的位置上。玛格丽特坐在他的身边，看着他握着方向盘的双手，感觉有种宿怨已久所带来的丝丝凉意。“我不能当作什么事都没发生过，”她心里恨恨地想，“过去的一周除了我以外，还没人开过这车。”因为她很清楚这种想法是没道理的——约翰拥有使用车的另一半权利，毕竟——她装作饶有兴致地问他：“你的旅行怎么样？那边的天气如何？”

“好极了。”他说道。她再一次对他口吻中的温暖感到生气。如果她对小汽车使用权的想法是不理智的，那么对他这种沾沾自喜的高兴劲儿的反感也是没道理的。“一切都很顺利，我敢保证能得到那份工作，大家对合作都很开心，我两周后回去把事情搞定。”

她心想：他总是言简意赅，如果他想让我了解事情的来龙去脉，便会娓娓道来的。我想不但我会为他得到合同而感到开心，大家也都会高兴的，这次回来的事我也就不想深究了。

“那么，也许我可以跟你一起去，”她说道，“你母亲来照顾孩子们。”

“好吧。”他说道，但是隔了好一会儿他才说这话，在他开口之前，她能够察觉到他在犹豫。

“我也想去，”小约翰说，“我能跟爸爸一起去吗？”

他们一起回了家，玛格丽特带着最小的女儿，而约翰一边拿着行李箱，一边开心地和小约翰争论他们俩谁拿着的行李箱更重一些。房间都已经收拾妥当了，玛格丽特设法把房间拾掇得干净和整齐。毫无疑问，作为一名独自带着年幼孩子的妻子，她很称职。小约翰随意扔得到处都是的玩具已经被捡了起来，宝贝女儿的衣服（不管怎么说，在约翰走后根本没人登门拜访）也已经收好，这些衣服本来是搭在厨房的暖气片上烘干的。尽管这样，也掩盖不了这样的事实：这房间不像是给某个特殊人物准备的，而只是给某个有教养和整洁的人，能够配得上这个干净利索房间的人准备的。玛格丽特觉得它过去本来可以称为家，一个幸福的家庭可以在此平静地过上家庭生活的地方。她把女婴放到一个有护栏的游戏区，手里拿着她的帽子和外衣，转身看着她的丈夫。他弯下身子，很严肃地听着小约翰在讲着什么。“他是谁？”她突然感到奇怪，“他的个头是不是变高了？他不是我丈夫。”

她笑了起来，他们都扭过头看着她，小约翰觉得好奇，她丈夫脸上闪过一丝明知已经露馅的神情。她心想：“这是为什么，他不是我丈夫，他已经明白我看出来了。”在此之前，她曾考虑过半分钟，这是不可思议的，但是现在事情已经很清楚了，她却未感到震惊，事情明摆着了，吃惊也没有任何意义，但也不能说她感情上没有起波澜。她发现自己最初只有一些外在的表现：心跳得很厉害，双手在颤抖，手指冰凉，双腿也觉得发软，她不得不靠在椅子背上支撑着自己。匪夷所思的是，她发现自己竟然还在笑着，当感情终于平复下来以后，她明白了笑声的含义——那是一种解脱。

“我很高兴你回来了。”她说道。她走上前去，把头靠在他的肩膀上。“在火车站跟你问好很难为情。”她说道。

小约翰抬头看了他们一会儿，然后自己走到玩具箱处玩了起来。玛格丽特此时心中暗想：“面前的这个男人不是那个喜欢看我哭的男人，我没必要害怕。”她屏住了呼吸，安静了下来。没有什么需要挑明的了。

那天剩下的时间她都很快乐。可以从恐惧和不幸的重压下解脱出来，她如释重负，喜悦之情不断涌上心头，这是一种很纯粹的喜悦，她明白不会再有任何猜忌和怨恨的残渣出现了。当她叫他“约翰”的时候，似乎很认真，而心里明白他也在默契地配合她进行这场游戏。当他客客气气地回应她的呼唤时，她都能想象出他话语背后使劲憋住的笑声。他们似乎都清醒地认识到，把这层窗户纸捅破可千万使不得。事实上，那样做会威胁到目前的快乐和祥和的气氛。

晚饭时，他们都很愉快。在过去，约翰是不会给她调鸡尾酒的，但当她把孩子们安顿到床上，从楼上走下来时，这位陌生人在楼梯下面迎着她，仰着脸冲她微笑着，然后拉着她的手，把她领到起居室里。在那儿，鸡尾酒的调酒器和玻璃杯已经放在了炉火前面的小矮桌上了。

“多么美妙呀。”她说道，她很高兴地忙里偷闲梳了梳头发，又抹了些口红；很高兴起居室里摆放着她以前和约翰一起挑选的咖啡桌，无数次目睹约翰生起火的壁炉，以及约翰有时会在上面睡觉的沙发，所有的这一切，看上去都很适合且雅致地迎接这位陌生人。她坐在沙发上，微笑地看着他，他递给了她一个玻璃杯。周遭弥漫着一种莫名的、暧昧的兴奋气氛，她正在“款待”一个男人。稍微有些煞风景的是，他为她调制的马丁尼酒里，既没有放橄榄，也没放洋葱。其实放了这两种东西才是她最中意的马丁尼酒，显然他不清楚这一点。然而她又自我安慰地想到，在他来之前，他自然花了些功夫来了解这些，不过没法那么周全罢了。

他微笑着向她举起酒杯。她觉得他来这儿只是为了她。

“能在这儿真是太好了。”他说道。他其实在开车回家的路上就已经煞费苦心地让自己听上去跟约翰一个腔调了。在他明白她已经识破了他，知道他实际上不过是个陌生人以后，他就没再试图说什么像“回家”或者“回来”一类的话了。当然，她也不能表现出自己揣着明白装糊涂。她把一只手放在他的手掌中，靠着沙发，眼睛盯着炉火。

“孤独是世界上最糟糕的感觉。”她说道。

“你现在不感到孤独了？”

“你打算走吗？”

“不走，除非你也走。”看到他对约翰拙劣的模仿，两个人都心照不宣地大笑了起来。

他们吃晚餐时是紧挨着坐在一起的。而以前她和约翰通常是很正式地坐在桌子的两端，彼此礼貌地让对方递一下盐瓶和黄油。

“我打算在那边放一套小架子，”他一边说，一边点头示意要把东西放在餐厅的角落，“那儿看上去很空，需要放些东西，有象征意义的东西。”

“比如说？”她喜欢端详他。她觉得他的头发比约翰的更黑一些，他的双手也更大一些。这个男人能够构建起他想要的一切。

“我们需要把一些东西放在一起，我们俩都喜欢的东西，一些精致、漂亮的东西。比如一些象牙制品。”

如果是以前和约翰生活在一起的时候，她肯定会马上说他们买不起这种精致、漂亮的东西，给他的想法泼冷水，但是和这个陌生人一起，她说道：“那我们得好好挑挑，不是每件东西都合适。”

“我有一次见过一个小东西，”他说道，“像一个特别小的人，只是颜色就只有紫色、蓝色和金色几种。”




她忘不了这次对话，它蕴含着的意义就像一件放在夜里的珠宝。又过了很久，她告诉自己这事是真的，要是约翰的话，他是不会说这些事情的。




她很幸福，神采飞扬，丝毫没有负罪感。他在第二天上午乖乖地去了他的办公室，在家门口道别时，微笑中带着懊悔，似乎在嘲弄目前这套约翰过去一直在完成的规定动作。当她看着他在门口的路上走远时，禁不住思索这样的日子肯定不会长久，但她又无法忍受每天跟他分别这么长时间，她和约翰分别时从未感受过这种思念。然而，如果他不断地做每天约翰所做的事情，那么不知不觉地他可能就会越来越像约翰。“我们只需一走了之。”她心想。一想到这儿，她又变得开心起来，目送他钻进了汽车。她会很高兴和他分享一切——不折不扣地给他全部——约翰所拥有的一切，只要他作为陌生人跟她待在一起。

当她做家务和给小女儿穿衣时，会忍不住开口笑出声。她很满意地打开了他的行李箱。他已经把行李箱扔到了卧室的角落里，忘到了脑后，虽然他可能也做好了重新拿上它离开的准备，只要她不是他想象的样子，或者不想让他留下来。她从行李箱中拿出了他的衣物，令人释然，很像约翰的行头，她在衣橱前迟疑了一下，把他和约翰的东西放在一起他是否会介意？随后，她又告诉自己，不会的，他不会胡思乱想的，只要他能开始适应和约翰的妻子在一起。想到这儿，她又笑了。

宝贝女儿还是整天吵吵闹闹，而小约翰从幼儿园一回到家里，第一件事就是急切地四处寻找，“爸爸去哪儿了？”

“爸爸已经上班去了。”她又笑出了声，就在这一刻，她脑子里快速闪过一幅看起来自己很狡黠的画面，这未尝不是对约翰的羞辱。




在白天的时间里，她有六七次上楼，去看他的行李箱，而且轻轻地抚摩行李箱的皮子。当她经过餐厅时，眼睛不停地看着那个打算有朝一日放小架子的角落，告诉自己他们会找到人偶做摆设的。小人偶通体是紫色、蓝色和金色的，它站立在架子上，保护家人免遭侵扰。

孩子们从午睡中醒来，她带着他们出门散步。可是一出了门，就好像又猛地回到了从前那种孤独的模式（和孩子们散步，无意义地谈论爸爸，渴望有个人可以在夜晚来临之前交流，拖延着不匆匆赶回家：他可能会打电话），她又开始感觉到害怕了。是她弄错了吗？她不太可能会弄错，要是今天晚上约翰回家了，对他来说是一种无以言表的残忍。

随后，她听到了停车声，打开房门，向外望去，心中暗想：“不对，那不是我丈夫，我丈夫回家时不会带着这种高兴劲儿。”从他的微笑中，她知道他已经察觉到了她的怀疑。然而，毫无疑问他是一个陌生人，一看到就能明白，她没有必要说出来。

相反，在那天晚上，她只是问了他一些差不多是毫无意义的问题，而他的回答则很重要，只是因为她要把这些回答储藏在记忆中，在他不在的时候能够让自己宽心。她问他，上大学时，教他们莎士比亚课程的教授叫什么名字？在他遇见自己前，喜欢的女孩是谁？他微笑着说他不知道，甚至连她告诉了他答案，他都不会想起那些名字。听到这样的回答的时候，她反而很高兴。这就说明，他并没有不厌其烦地掌握过去所有的细节；他已经了解了足够多的信息（孩子们的名字，家的住址，她喜欢喝鸡尾酒）来接近她，至于后面的事，也就不重要了，因为要么她想让他留下来，要么把约翰叫回来，把他打发走。

“你最喜欢吃的食物是什么？”她问他，“你喜欢钓鱼吗？你曾经养过狗吗？”

“今天有人告诉我，”他又一次提到，“他听说我从波士顿回来了，但我确定他实际上是想说，听说我死在波士顿了。”

他也是孤独的，她伤心地想道：“这也许就是他来这儿的原因，带来了某种宿命。现在我会每天晚上都看到他从门口进来，还会想到这不是我丈夫，在等他的时候，会情不自禁地想，我正在等一个陌生人。”

不管怎样，她说道：“你在波士顿没有死，也没有别的什么要紧事发生。”

早上，她看着他离开家，带着一种温暖和骄傲，她也开始做家务，给宝贝穿衣服。小约翰从幼儿园回到家，他什么也没问，只是迅速地用眼睛四下打量一圈，然后叹了口气。当孩子们睡午觉的时候，她想今天下午她可能会带他们去公园，然后又想起了另一个类似的下午，还有另一个除了孩子们没人陪伴的下午，以及另一个她做了寡妇的下午，现实无法让她继续设想下去。她心想：“我已经做得够多的了，受够了。今天除了面对孩子们以外，我必须再看些别的东西，没人能够忍受这样的孤独。”

她很快行动了起来，自己穿着打扮好，把房间也收拾妥当。她给一个高中女生打电话，问她是否可以替她带孩子们去公园。没有任何的负疚感，她忘记了无数次要给宝贝订制合适外套的事，也忘记了他们从公园回来，小约翰要吃的爆米花还有没有。她从家里逃了出来，边走边想：“我必须要找个人。”

她打了一辆出租车到城里去，因为在她看来，唯一可能的事就是去给他买个礼物，她给他的第一份礼物。她想到也许她会送他一件小摆设，一个通身紫色、蓝色和金色的小人。

她在城里各式各样奇怪的商店里逛着，挑选一些可以摆在架子上的可爱的小东西。她用挑剔的眼光长时间地看着各种象牙制品，各种雕像，各种色彩鲜艳而又毫无意义的昂贵玩具，挑选适合作为礼物送给一个陌生人的东西。

当她带着大包小包开始踏上回家的路时，天都快黑了。她从出租车的车窗向外注视着黑暗的街道，开心地想到，那个陌生人可能在她前面已经到家了，正从窗户那儿看着她匆匆忙忙地往家赶。当他看到她回来时，可能也会想：“她是一个陌生人，我正在等待一个陌生人。”“到了，”她边轻敲着玻璃，边说道，“师傅，就是这儿了。”她从出租车里走下来，付了车费，当出租车开走了以后，她面带着微笑。“我看上去一定不错，”她心想，“因为那位出租车司机都冲着我微笑。”

她转过身，开始向家里走去，随后又犹豫了起来。“我该不会下车晚了吧？这不可能呀，”她心想，“不会吧，但我们家的房屋应该是白色的呀？”

夜色变得越来越暗了，她只能看到房屋是成排的，还有更多的房屋在这排房屋的远处，远处还有更多的房屋，这些房屋中肯定有一栋是她的家，家里有一个美丽的陌生人，可她在外面迷了路。





恶魔情人


她睡得不好，从一点半杰米走了以后，她就开始在床上辗转反侧，直到早上七点钟还没睡踏实，最后她还是强迫自己起床去煮咖啡。这个觉睡得断断续续，像折腾似的醒来，她睁开眼睛，睡眼蒙眬地盯着半明半暗的房间，脑海里一遍又一遍地回忆，仿佛又坠入了发烧一般的梦境当中。她花了差不多一个小时煮咖啡——他们打算在路上去吃一顿像样的早餐——然后，除了她想早一点儿披上婚纱，应该没什么别的事可做了。她洗了咖啡杯，铺好了床，仔细地挑选着她打算穿的衣服。她在窗户边看着外面，杞人忧天地担心今天天气是否晴朗。她坐下来想看会儿书，又想到还是给姐姐写封信吧，于是她用娟秀的字体开始写道：“我最亲爱的安妮，你收到这封信的时候，我可能已经结婚了。听上去是不是很好笑？我自己都不敢相信，但是，当我告诉你事情的原委，你会明白它比你想象的还要意想不到，比……”

她手里拿着笔坐在那儿，读着已经写好的头几行字，反复斟酌接下来应该写些什么，然后，又把信撕掉了。她走到窗边，看到外面毫无疑问是个晴天，突然冒上来一个念头，想起也许她不应该穿那件蓝色的丝质连衣裙，它太不起眼，几乎是有点儿老气，她想穿得更温柔、更淑女一些。情急之下，她在衣橱里翻弄着衣服，犹豫着是否应该穿去年夏天她穿过的那件印花连衣裙。这件衣服对她来说，或许太过年轻，而且还有个有褶饰边的领子，现在这个季节穿这件印花连衣裙在这一年里显得时候太早，但是仍然……

她把两件连衣裙并排挂在衣橱门的外面，小心地打开有镜子的那扇门仔细端详。紧挨着衣橱的是她的小厨房，她点燃了咖啡壶底下的炉子，然后走到窗户前，窗外阳光明媚。当咖啡壶发出刺啦啦的响声的时候，她走了回去，给自己往一个干净的杯子里倒满咖啡。她心想：光喝咖啡，还抽了那么多烟，又没吃一顿像样的早餐，如果我不快点儿填饱肚子，一定会头痛的。结婚这天可千万不能头痛。她走进盥洗室，从小壁橱里拿出了一小锡盒阿司匹林，把它放进了她蓝色的手袋中。如果她要穿那件印花连衣裙，就得换一个褐色的手袋来搭配，可她唯一的那个褐色手袋有些破旧了。她很无助地站在那里，把目光从蓝色手袋转到印花连衣裙上，然后又把手袋放下，走了回去，拿起咖啡，重新坐回了窗户边，一边喝着咖啡，一边仔细环顾这一居室的公寓房。他们计划今天晚上再回到这儿，所以一切都必须安排妥当。突然，她的心头一惊，意识到自己忘了把干净的床单子铺到床上。熨洗的东西刚刚取回来，于是她把干净的床单和枕套从壁橱最上面的架子上拿了下来，而且把床上的床单和枕套等织物都扒了下来。她干得很快，是为了避免让自己有意识地考虑正在更换床单的原因。这是张单人床，上面盖着一个被罩，看上去像一把躺椅。当她把这些料理完之后，没人会知道她已经把干净的床单铺在上面了。她把旧床单和枕套拿到了盥洗室，放进了一个大篮子里，把盥洗室的毛巾也扔进了篮子，把干净的毛巾搭到了架子上。当她干完这一切回来时尽管咖啡已经凉了，但她还是把它喝了。

最后，她看了一下钟表，已经九点多了，她终于意识到要抓紧时间了。她洗了一个澡，用了一条干净的毛巾，然后把用过的毛巾放到了大篮子里，又换了一条干净的毛巾放到架子上。她用心地穿着打扮了一番，把内衣全部换成了新洗的，而且大部分是全新的。她把昨天穿过的所有衣服，包括睡衣都放到了大篮子里。当她准备穿连衣裙时，又在衣橱门前犹豫了起来。蓝色连衣裙当然体面、干净、非常合身，但是她和杰米在一起时已经穿过好几次了，而且在结婚的日子里，它看上去很普通，不会为结婚的日子添光增彩。印花连衣裙非常漂亮，而且是新的，杰米也没见她穿过，但是在这个季节穿这件印花连衣裙，显然是赶在了季节前面。最后她下了决心：今天是我结婚的日子，我想穿什么就穿什么。她从衣架上把印花连衣裙拿了下来。当把裙子套上头穿在身上的时候，她觉得精神一振，立马感到凉爽了起来。可当她照镜子看着自己时，突然意识到裙子领子处的花边似乎不能给她细长的脖子增色，而宽阔的裙摆怎么看怎么像小姑娘穿的，穿着这件裙子可以自由地奔跑、跳舞；走路时，裙摆会随着胯部的扭动而一摇一摆。看着镜中的自己，她嫌弃地琢磨，“好像我在处心积虑地使自己看上去更漂亮，只是为了取悦他，他会以为我想让自己显得更年轻，就是想让他娶我。”她三下五除二地把印花裙子脱下来，结果把胳膊下的接缝处给扯开了。还是穿那件旧的蓝色连衣裙，她会觉得舒服和熟悉，但是又毫无新意。“你不应该穿这种玩意儿。”她坚定地对自己说，然后情绪低落地转身来到衣橱前想看看还有没有别的衣服可穿，可根本没有一件适合她和杰米结婚穿的衣服。过了一会儿，她想马上出门，去附近小店里赶紧买一件衣服。可抬头看了一下表，都快十点了，她没有时间做别的事了，只能梳理一下头发、化个妆。她梳理头发很简单，在后颈处把头发拢在一起盘个发髻即可，可化妆就是另外一件煞费苦心的工作了，要在看上去尽可能漂亮，又尽量不要让人看出过度的粉饰之间求得平衡。今天，她不想设法掩盖皮肤的暗黄和眼角边的鱼尾纹，好像她为了今天的婚礼特意这样做似的。可无论如何，她无法忍受这种想法：杰米娶了一个看上去形容枯槁、满脸皱纹的女人。虽然证件上的岁数一栏里写的是三十，可你毕竟是个三十四岁的女人了，她在盥洗室的镜子前狠巴巴地自言自语道。

十点过两分了，她对自己的衣服、脸上的妆、这间屋子的一切还是不满意。她把咖啡再次加热，又坐在了窗户边的椅子上。她心想：反正现在也没法做更多的事情了，在最后一分钟还想有所改善也不现实。

事已至此，她反而让自己少安毋躁了。她努力在想杰米，但是好像无法看清他的脸庞或者听清他的声音了。对于你所爱的人，这种情况倒也司空见惯，她琢磨着，让她的思路从过去、今天和明天，转到了更加遥远的未来。到了那时，杰米应该已经成了一位小有名气的作家，她也辞去了工作，他们上周一直在准备的乡间别墅的规划已经实现。“我过去可是个相当棒的厨师呢。”她信誓旦旦地跟杰米说，“只要给我一点儿时间让我练习一下，我还能想起天使蛋糕和炸鸡的做法。”她知道如何让自己的话给杰米留下深刻印象，于是不无温柔地补充了一句，“还有荷兰酱呢。”

十点半了，她站起身果断地走到电话机旁，拨了一个号码，等了一会儿，一个女孩的金属般质感的声音响了起来，“……现在的标准时间是十点二十九分。”她下意识地把钟表拨回了一分钟。她还记得昨天晚上自己在大门口说的话，“到了十点钟，我会把一切准备妥当。此话能当真吗？”

杰米在门厅过道上大笑了一路。

到了十一点的时候，她已经把印花连衣裙扯开的裂缝补好了，把针线盒仔细地放回了橱柜。她穿着这件印花连衣裙，坐在窗户边喝着另外一杯咖啡。“不管怎么说，我刚才不应该把太多的时间浪费在穿衣上。”她心想。可是现在这个点儿他已经迟到了，他或许随时会来。她向来是一切都准备妥当，才敢开始尝试一件事情的。现在家里没有什么吃的了，除了她精心保存的，为他们开始共同生活而准备的食物：还没有开封的一袋培根，还在盒子里的成打的鸡蛋，没有打开的面包和黄油。他们明天就要一起吃早餐了。她想留一张便条贴在门上，然后跑到楼下药店买点儿什么东西吃。然而，她还是决定再多等一会儿。

到了十一点三十分，她有点儿头晕目眩，心里发慌了，不得不下楼去吃点儿东西。要是杰米留下电话号码的话，刚才她还能给他打个电话。现在，她却只能打开书桌，拿出纸笔给他留个便条，“杰米，我去楼下药店了，五分钟后就回来。”她的钢笔有点儿漏水，墨迹沾到了手指上，她跑到盥洗室把手洗了洗，用了一条刚换的毛巾擦了擦手。她把便条钉在了门上，又一次四下打量了一遍屋子，确信一切都很完美，然后虚掩了门，没有上锁，以免万一他进不来。

在药店，除了更多的咖啡，她没有发现什么能勾起胃口的东西。她放下喝了一半的咖啡离开了，因为忽然意识到，杰米可能在楼上等着呢，他有些急不可耐地想开始他们两人共同的生活。

可是楼上还是一切照旧，静悄悄的，跟她刚离开时一模一样，便条还在门上，没人读过。屋里的空气中弥漫着烟味，不是很清新，她把窗户打开，坐了下来。直到睁开眼睛一看，已经差二十分钟就到一点了，她才意识到自己刚才睡着了。

现在，她冷不丁清醒了，突然觉得有些害怕。看着屋里的一切都已万事俱备，等待着主人们的新生活，可从上午十点钟起，每件物品与陈设都是那么整洁，根本没人动过。她吓坏了，而且感觉到一种迫切的需要，她从椅子上站起来，几乎是跑着穿过屋子来到盥洗室，往脸上泼了些冷水，用一条干净的毛巾擦了擦脸。这一次，她把毛巾小心地放回了架子上，但并没有换一条新毛巾。以后有足够的时间再换。她没有戴帽子就出了门，还是穿着那件印花连衣裙，只是在外面披了一件外套，手上拿着那个不太相配的蓝色手袋，里面装着阿司匹林。这次她把公寓门锁上了，也没有贴便条，便转身跑下了楼梯。她在街角打了一辆出租车，给了司机杰米的地址。

其实根本没有多远，如果不是这样虚弱的话，她本来可以走着过去。然而，在出租车上，她猛然认识到，就这样打辆出租车厚着脸皮去杰米住的地方找他，该是多么的冒失。所以，她让司机在靠近杰米住处的一个角落把她放下，付完车费后，看着出租车开走了，她才开始沿着街道走了过去。她以前从没来过这儿，这栋建筑看上去不错，只是有些古老。她发现杰米的名字既没有出现在前厅的邮箱上，也没有出现在任何一扇门的门铃旁边。她又核对了一下地址，地址没错。最后，她按下了标有“管理员”字样的门铃。在门铃响了一两分钟之后，她推开了房门，走进了一个黢黑的门厅。她在门厅里迟疑了片刻，直到听见过道尽头有扇房门打开了，有人问道：“谁呀？”

就在这时，她意识到自己不知道应该问些什么，所以她走近了些，向那个正在等着的人走近了些，身后房门里漏出的灯光把他照得影影绰绰。她靠得更近了，那个人影再次问道：“谁呀？”她看清楚了，那是个穿着长袖衬衫的男人，虽然他看不清她的脸，但她却能看清他。

不知从哪里来的勇气，她说道：“我想找一个住在这栋楼里的人，但在外面我没找到他的名字。”

“你要找的人叫什么名字？”那个男人问道。她才意识到自己刚才忘了说名字。

“杰米·哈里斯，”她说道，“哈里斯。”

那个男人沉吟了一会儿，然后说道：“哈里斯。”他转过身，对着里面正亮着灯的房间喊了一嗓子，“玛吉，你出来一下。”

“什么事？”里面传来一个声音，又等了一段时间，这段时间长得足够让某个人从舒适的躺椅中慢慢起身再走过来。一个女人站到了他的身边，鉴于门厅黑乎乎的，他们站在门口。“这位女士，”那个男人说道，“这位女士在找一个叫哈里斯的人，他住在这里，这楼里有这么个人吗？”

“没有。”女人说道。接着她用一种愉快的声音说：“这儿没人姓哈里斯。”

“对不起。”男人说道。他开始关房门了，“女士，你找错楼门了。”他说道，然后又用一种更低的声音补充道，“或者找错了人。”他和那个女人都咧嘴笑了起来。

房门几乎要全关上了，她一个人站在黑暗的门厅中，对着还有一丝光亮的门缝喊道：“但是他确实住在这儿，我知道的。”

“你瞧，”那个女人说道，又把门开了一道缝，“这种事天天都在发生。”

“请别搞错了。”她说道，声音中带着一种格外的高贵，以及三十四年所累积的骄傲，“我恐怕您没搞明白。”

“他看上去长什么样？”那个女人有气无力，而且不耐烦地问道，门仍然只开了道缝。

“他个头很高，很精神，平时老穿着一身蓝色套装，是个作家。”

“没有，”那个女人说道，随后又补了一句，“他或许住在三楼吧？”

“我不敢肯定。”

“是有这么个家伙，”女人若有所思地说道，“他经常穿一身蓝色套装，住在三楼有一段时间了。住在那儿的罗伊斯特夫妇去北部地区探亲了，这段时间就把他们的公寓租给他了。”

“有可能，我觉得，虽然……”

“这个人大多数时间穿着蓝色套装，但是我不知道他多高，”女人说道，“他住在那儿大约有一个月了。”

“一个月前，那应该是——”

“你去问一下罗伊斯特夫妇吧，”那个女人说道，“他们今天上午回来了。住在3B号房间。”

房门彻底关上了，走廊很黑，楼梯看上去更黑。

在二楼，从高处天窗透过一丝光线，各个公寓的房门一溜排开，这一层有四户人家，家家都很安静，有种拒人于千里之外的感觉。2C号房间的门口还放着一瓶牛奶。

在三楼，她停了一会儿。从3B房门的一头传出了音乐声，她也能听见里面有人在说话。最后，她敲了敲门，过了一会儿又敲了敲。门开了，音乐声扑面而来，是一档午后的交响乐广播节目。“您好！”她对站在门口的女人礼貌地说道，“您是罗伊斯特太太吗？”

“我是。”这个穿着宽大便服，晚妆还没有卸的女人说道。

“我想占用您一分钟时间跟您谈几句话，可以吗？”

“可以。”罗伊斯特太太说道，但没有动身子。

“是关于哈里斯先生的事。”

“哪个哈里斯先生？”罗伊斯特太太干巴巴地问道。

“詹姆斯·哈里斯先生。租借您公寓的那位先生。”

“哦，上帝呀。”罗伊斯特太太说道，她似乎第一次睁开了她的眼睛。“他干什么了？”

“没什么。我只是想联系上他。”

“哦，上帝呀。”罗伊斯特太太又说了一遍。然后，她把房门开得更大了一些，说道：“进来吧，”又喊道，“拉尔夫！”

房间里还充斥着音乐声，在沙发上、椅子上、地板上，放着收拾了一半的大大小小的几个行李箱。在房间一角的桌子上，摆放着还没有收拾的残羹冷炙。一个年轻人坐在那儿，乍一看还有点像杰米，他站起身，穿过房间走了过来。

“怎么了？”他问道。

“罗伊斯特先生，”她说道，音乐的声音很大，很难让人听清她的话，“楼下的管理员告诉我，您的公寓住过一位叫詹姆斯·哈里斯的先生。”

“没错，”他说，“如果他真叫这个名字的话。”

“我以为是您租借给了他这间公寓。”她有点吃惊地说道。

“我对他一无所知。”罗伊斯特先生说道，“他是多蒂的一个朋友。”

“不是我的朋友，”罗伊斯特太太说道，“我跟他也不熟。”她走到桌子前，把花生酱抹在一片面包上，咬了一口面包，声音沙哑地说道。然后，冲着她丈夫挥动着面包和花生酱，“不是我的朋友。”

“你是在一个该死的聚会上偶然结识他的。”罗伊斯特先生说道，他推了推收音机旁椅子上的行李，腾出了点儿空坐了下来，又从身边地板上捡起一本杂志，“我和他总共没说过十句话。”

“租借给他这个地方你是同意的。”罗伊斯特太太在咬下另一口面包之前说道，“不管怎么说，你从没说过他一个不字。”

“我对你的朋友从来不说三道四。”罗伊斯特先生说道。

“如果他是我的朋友，你会说他很多的不是，绝对会是这样。”罗伊斯特太太耷拉着脸说道。她又咬了一口面包，说道：“相信我，他绝对会编排我朋友的不是。”

“我猜你就会这么说，”罗伊斯特先生从杂志上方抬眼说道，“我受够了。”

“你看看，”罗伊斯特太太用抹着花生酱的面包指着她丈夫说道，“成天到晚，就这么一招。”

除了下方挨着罗伊斯特先生的收音机传出的音乐，没人说话了。然后，她用一种几乎很难相信在收音机的噪声中还能被听见的声音说道：“那么说，他已经走了？”

“谁？”罗伊斯特太太从花生酱罐的后面抬起头问道。

“詹姆斯·哈里斯先生。”

“他吗？他今天上午在我们回来之前，一定是已经走了，现在杳无踪影了。”

“消失了？”

“一切都没什么改变，家里和我们走时一模一样。不过一切都很好，非常的好。我跟你说过。”她对着罗伊斯特先生说道，“我跟你说过他会把一切照料得很好的，我说的没错吧。”

“算你走运。”罗伊斯特先生说道。

“没有一件东西不在原位上。”罗伊斯特太太说道。她把抹着花生酱的面包在空中画了一个圈，表示所有一切，“每件东西都跟我们离开时完全一样。”

“您知道他现在去哪儿了吗？”

“完全不知道，”罗伊斯特太太欢快地说道，“但是，正像我所说的，他把屋里的每件东西都照料得挺好。为什么？”她突然问道，“你找他干吗？”

“倒也不是多么重要的事。”

“我很抱歉他不在这儿了。”罗伊斯特太太说道。当她看见自己的来访者转身走向房门时，礼节性地走上前送了送。

“管理员或许见过他。”罗伊斯特先生说道，但目光还在杂志上。

房门在她身后关上了，走廊又陷入了一片黑暗当中，但是收音机的声音也被隔绝了。当她第一层楼梯下到一半时，房门又打开了，罗伊斯特太太冲着楼梯井喊道：“如果我看见他，我会告诉他你正在找他。”

“我还能做什么？”她心里嘀咕着，又来到了街上。回家是不可能的了，没有和杰米在一起，家也就不能成为他们连接彼此的纽带。她在人行道上站了很长时间，以至于对面楼上的一个女人从窗户里斜探出身子，转过头去叫屋里的某人过来看她。最后，她脑袋一热，走进了那栋公寓楼隔壁的小熟食店，店铺的一侧是通向自己公寓的街道。店里有位小个子男人倚靠着柜台正在看报纸，当她进来后，他抬头看着她，然后在柜台里面走到她这边。

隔着存放冷藏肉和奶酪的玻璃柜，她怯生生地问道：“我正在设法联系上一个男人，他住在隔壁的那栋公寓楼里，我想知道您是否认识他。”

“你干吗不问问那楼里的人呢？”那个男人问道，眯缝着眼睛，上下打量着她。

“大概是因为我不买东西的缘故吧。”她心想。然后，她鼓足勇气说：“我很抱歉，我问了他们了，但是他们对他一无所知，他们认为今天上午他离开了那栋公寓。”

“我不知道您究竟想知道些什么。”他说道，身子往后靠了靠，凑近了他的报纸。“我在这儿可不是为了观察那些进出隔壁公寓楼人们行踪的。”

她很快地说道：“我想您兴许已经注意到了，总之，他可能来过这儿，就在刚刚不到十点的时候。他的个头很高，通常穿一身蓝色套装。”

“女士，你知道每天有多少穿蓝色套装的男人经过这里吗？”那个男人问道，“你以为我闲着没事干，只是——”

“对不起。”她说道。当她走出店门的时候，她听见那个男人嘟囔道：“看在上帝的分上。”

当她走向街道的拐角时突然想道：他一定走过这条路，这是到我住的房子的必经之路，他只能走这条路。她的脑海中浮现出杰米走在这条路上的画面：他从哪儿穿过街道？他到底是个什么样的人——他是在自己的公寓楼前面穿过街道，是随意在街道中间的任何一处呢，还是在街角？

街角有个报亭，他们在那儿也许见过他。她急忙走到报亭前，在一边等着。一位男士买了一份报纸，还有一位女士问了路。当报亭里的男人看着她时，她赶紧问道：“您兴许能告诉我，今天上午大约十点钟的时候，是不是有个穿着一身蓝色套装，大高个的年轻男人路过了这儿？”报亭里的男人看着她，眼睛睁得很大，嘴也微微张着。她心想，他一定认为她这是在开玩笑或者在作恶作剧。于是，她又赶忙说道：“这事很重要，请相信我，我没有跟您闹着玩儿。”

“喂，女士。”那个男人刚要开始说话，她又急切地说道：“他是个作家，可能在这儿买过杂志。”

“您找他干什么呢？”男人问道，微笑地看着她。她意识到自己身后站着另一位男人，报亭里的男人也在冲着他微笑。“您要是不知道也没关系。”她说道。但是报亭里的男人却说：“您瞧，也许他确实来过这里。”他微笑着好像知道些什么，目光却越过她落到了她身后的男人身上。她突然惊恐地意识到她还穿着那件太过年轻的印花连衣裙，很快把外套向上拉了拉。报亭里的男人很是深思熟虑地说道：“现在我不敢肯定，尽管如此，但是今天上午确实有个很像你男朋友的人来过这儿。”

“是大约十点钟左右吗？”

“是十点来钟。”报亭里的男人点了点头，“高个儿，穿着蓝色套装。我一点儿也没觉得有什么奇怪的。”

“他走的哪条路？”她着急地问道，“是沿着这条路往住宅区去了吗？”

“是往住宅区方向去了，”报亭里的男人点点头说道。“他是朝那个方向去了，没错，就是那条路。先生，您需要点儿什么？”

她紧紧攥着外套，向后退了退。那个一直站在她身后的男人注视着她，这时他和报亭里的男人相互交换了一下眼色。她琢磨了一会儿，是否要给报亭里的男人一些小费，可是当她匆匆忙忙地穿过街道时，听到那两个男人开始哈哈大笑起来。

住宅区，她心想，那就对了。她开始沿着街道往上走了，边走边琢磨：他不必穿过那条街，只需走六个街区，往下一拐就到我住的街道了。只要他往住宅区这边走，就错不了。她大约走了一个街区，路过了一家花店。橱窗里摆放着婚礼用的花卉装饰。她想：毕竟今天是我们结婚的日子，他可能会想到要给我买些花。于是她又走了进去。花店老板从店铺的后面迎了出来，笑容满面，衣冠楚楚，在他开口说话之前，她笑容满面地抢先张嘴了，没有给他机会问她打算要买点儿什么。“我想联系上一位先生，他今天上午有可能进这家店买了些鲜花，这事对我来说特别重要，真的很重要。”

她停下来喘了口气。花店老板说道：“好吧，他都买了些什么花？”

“我不知道，”她吃惊似的说道，“他从不——”，她停顿了一下，然后又接着说，“他是位个头很高的年轻人，穿着蓝色套装，十点钟左右来的。”

“明白了。”花店老板说道，“嗯，说实话，我恐怕……”

“但是这很重要，”她说道，“他可能来得很匆忙。”她又充满希望地补充道。

“好吧。”花店老板说道。他很亲切地微笑着，露出了一口小白牙。“花是送给一位女士的吧。”他说道，走到柜台前，打开了一个大本子，“花是送到哪里的？”他问道。

“为什么，”她说道，“我觉得他不会让人送花的。您知道，他正要去——那就是说，他会自己把花带走。”

“女士，”花店老板说道，他刚才似乎被冒犯了，微笑变成了自嘲，但继续说道，“实际上，如果您真的必须这样想，除非我还有什么能继续帮您……”

“请再努力回忆一下。”她恳求道，“他个子很高，穿着一身蓝色套装，而且是上午十点钟左右。”

花店老板闭上了眼睛，一只手指放在嘴上，沉吟了半晌。然后摇了摇头，“我只能说爱莫能助了。”他说道。

“谢谢您。”她沮丧地说道，开始向门口走去，这时花店老板用一种尖厉、激动的声音说道：“等一下！再等一分钟，女士。”她转过身看着花店老板，而他又想了一会儿，终于开口说道：“菊花吗？”他用问询的目光看着她。

“哦，不。”她说道，声音中带着一丝颤抖，在她继续说下去之前，她停顿了一分钟，“菊花不适合那个场合，我敢肯定。”

花店老板闭紧了嘴，冷淡地看向了别处。“好吧，我当然不知道是什么场合。”他说道，“但是我几乎可以肯定，您正在打听的这个男人今天上午过来，买了一打菊花，没有叫人送货。”

“您确定？”她问道。

“确定，”花店老板有些同情她，断然地说道。“绝对就是那个男人。”他的笑容很灿烂，她也冲他微笑着，说道：“好吧，太感谢您了。”

他陪她走到门口，“这花作为身上的装饰很不错吧？”他说道。一边说，一边陪她穿过花店，“来几朵玫瑰？或者栀子花？”

“您人太好了，给了我很大帮助。”她走到门口时说道。

“女士们要是佩戴花朵，看上去总是光彩照人。”他边说，边把头凑过去。

“也许来几朵兰花？”

“不了，谢谢！”她说道。他也回应道：“我希望您能找到您的那位年轻小伙。”但声音里透着一股下流劲儿。

沿着街道走着，她想，每个人都会觉得她的穿着很可笑。她又把外套紧紧裹在身上，只有印花连衣裙下摆的花边能够露出来。

街角有一个警察，她心想：我为什么不去问问警察呢——去警局寻求帮助找一个失踪的人很正常呀。可接下来，她又想：我看上去是那么傻呀。她的脑海中很快出现了一个画面，自己站在警察局里说：“是的，我们今天要结婚，可是他没来。”而那些警察，三三两两地站在她周围，听她述说着，看着她，看着她的印花连衣裙，看着她太过夸张的妆容，会彼此不怀好意地暗笑。而她又不能提供给他们更多的情况了，她不可能说，“是的，这看上去很傻，不是吗？我刻意把自己打扮一番，想找到那个答应娶我的年轻男人，但是对于那些你们不知道的事情呢，你们又会怎么看？我身上的优点比这个要多得多，比你们眼见的要多得多。我有才华，而且或许还有幽默感，我是这样一位女子：骄傲、感情细腻、优雅，对生活有着清晰的认识，我会让我未来的丈夫满意、幸福而有创造力。绝非你们最初的印象。”

警方显然不可能找不到杰米，但杰米要是知道她求助警方去找他，会不会不高兴，会怎么想。“不行，不行。”她一边大声说着，一边加快了脚步，路过的人都停下来，好奇地看着她。

在下一个街角——距离她的住处只有三个街区的地方——有一个擦皮鞋摊。一位老人坐在其中一把椅子上昏昏欲睡。她在他面前停下脚步，等着他注意到她。过了一会儿，他睁开了眼睛，笑着看着她。

“您好，”她说道，在想好究竟说什么之前，话就脱口而出了，“很抱歉打扰您，我正在找一个年轻的男人，他今天上午十点钟左右从这条路经过，您看见他了吗？”她又开始描述，“高个，穿着蓝色套装，也许还拿着一束鲜花？”

在她说完之前，这个老人就开始点头了。“我看见他了，”他说道，“是你的朋友吗？”

“是的，”她说道，不由自主地也冲他微笑着。

老人眨了眨眼睛，说道：“记得当时我还在寻思，你是要去看女朋友吧，年轻人。这种打扮的年轻人都是约会女朋友的。”他说道，然后很宽容地摇了摇头。

“他走了哪条路？直接沿着这条街走的吗？”

“对的，”老人说道，“擦亮了皮鞋，拿着他的花，上下捯饬得挺精神，显得特别匆忙。你一定是急着去见女朋友，我当时心想。”

“谢谢您，”她一边说，一边在她的口袋里摸索着找些零钱。

“他女朋友也肯定会很高兴见到他，小伙子打扮得挺帅气。”老人说道。

“谢谢您，”她又说了一遍，手从口袋中拿了出来，但什么也没有。

这是她第一次真的肯定他是会等着她的。她赶忙走过三个街区，印花连衣裙的裙边在她的外套下摆来摆去。她拐进了自己住的街区，从街角她看不见自己房间的窗户，也看不见杰米是否在往外看，是否在等着她。她几乎一溜小跑，沿着街道奔向她的公寓。在楼下的房门处，她拿着钥匙的手指在不停地颤抖，她往药店望去的时候，想起了今天上午在那儿心神不宁地喝着咖啡，几乎要笑出声来。到了自己的房间门口，不能再等了，甚至在房门打开之前，她就急不可耐地开始喊着：“杰米，我回来啦，我刚才真是太担心了。”

只有自己的房间在等着她，安静，空无一人，午后从窗户照进来的光让影子变长了。片刻之间，她只看见了空咖啡杯。她想他可能一直在这儿等着，她尽量安慰着自己，但很快意识到这个杯子是上午喝完咖啡她自己撂在那儿的。她环顾房间，找遍了储物间，找遍了盥洗室，完全没有人进来过的迹象。

“我根本没见他来过，”药店的店员说道，“如果他来过，我会想起来的，因为我会注意到鲜花的。一整天没人拿着一束花进来过。”

擦皮鞋摊的那个老人再次醒来的时候，看见她正站在他的面前，“又见面了。”他微笑着说道。

“您确定吗？”她问道，“他是沿着这条街走过去的？”

“我亲眼看见的，”老人说道，对她怀疑的口吻有些愤愤不平，“我认为，那个年轻人是要去会他的女朋友，我看见他就走进了那栋房子。”

“什么房子？”她冷冷地问道。

“就在那边，”老人说道，他倾着身子指了指，“就在下一个街区，拿着他的花，皮鞋锃亮地去看他女朋友了，进了她住的房子。”

“哪一栋房子？”她问道。

“大概就是街区中间的那栋，”老人说，他满是狐疑地看着她，随后问道，“你究竟想干什么呀？”

她三步并作两步几乎是在小跑，都没顾得上停下对他说声“谢谢”。来到下一个街区，她快步走着，寻找着每栋房屋，希望从外面可以碰巧看到杰米也在从窗户里往外看，或者听到楼里的某个地方传出他的笑声。

一个女人正坐在一栋房屋的前面，用胳膊前前后后反复一个动作推动着婴儿车，车里的婴儿睡着了，随着车也在前后摇晃。

现在，提问变得很娴熟了。“抱歉，您看见没看见一个年轻的男人在今天上午十点钟左右走进了这栋房子？他个头很高，穿着蓝色套装，手里拿了一大捧鲜花。”

女人旁边有个大约十二岁的男孩，从玩耍中停了下来，转过身听她的问话。他专注地一会儿看看那个女人，一会儿又看看她，时不时地还瞟一眼车中的婴儿。

“您知道，”那个女人疲惫地说，“这个孩子要在十点钟洗澡，我怎么可能看见一个在附近转悠的奇怪的男人呢？您说是吧。”

“手上拿着一大捧鲜花吗？”男孩拉着她的外套问道，“一捧鲜花？我看见他了，女士。”

她低下头，小男孩很无礼地冲她咧嘴笑了笑。“他进了哪一栋房子？”她不耐烦地问道。

“你要和他离婚吗？”小男孩还是坚持问道。

“问一位女士这样的问题不礼貌。”摇晃着婴儿车的那个女人说道。

“听着，”小男孩说道，“我看见他了，他进了那儿。”他指着隔壁的一栋房子。“我跟着他，”小男孩说道，“他给了我二十五美分。”这个男孩压低了声音，粗起嗓子模仿大人的声音说道：“‘孩子，今天对我来说可是个大日子。’他说。然后给了我二十五美分。”

她给了他一美元的钞票。“在哪儿？”她问道。

“顶楼，”小男孩说道，“我跟着他直到他给了我这二十五美分。一直跟到了顶楼。”他向后退到了人行道上，她够不到他的地方，手里拿着一美元的钞票。“你会跟他离婚吗？”他再一次问道。

“他拿着花吗？”

“是的。”小男孩说道。他开始发出尖叫声，“你会和他离婚吗，女士？你抓到他的什么把柄了吗？”他沿着这条街一边飞快地跑着，一边大声喊叫着，“她抓到了那个可怜家伙的把柄了。”正摇晃着婴儿车的女人哈哈大笑了起来。

那栋公寓楼临街的楼门没有上锁，外面的门厅里也没有门铃，也没有门牌，楼梯又窄又脏。在顶楼上有两扇门，前门在右手边，门外的地板上扔着一张揉得皱巴巴的包鲜花的纸，还有一个打结的纸带，就像一条线索，一条在厚厚卷宗中的最后线索。

她敲了敲门，觉得能听见里面有说话声。冷不丁地，她害怕地想：如果杰米就在那儿，如果是他过来开门，我应该说些什么好呢？里面的说话声突然安静了下来。她又敲了敲门，还是一片静寂，除了远处传来的好像笑声一类的声音。她心想：也许他从窗户那儿已经看见我了。若有若无的声音可能是前面的公寓和那个小男孩发出的可怕的噪音。她等了一会儿，又敲了敲门，但还是一片静寂。

最后，她走到了同一层的另一扇门前，敲了敲。门在她敲时吱呀一声自动开了，她看出这是一间空无一人的阁楼，墙上还钉着光秃秃的木板条，地板上也没有刷漆。她走了进去，四下里看看。房间里堆满了一袋袋的石膏塑料袋，成摞的旧报纸，一段折断了的树干。有一种声音传过来，她突然意识到好像是老鼠的声音。接着，她就看见了一只老鼠，紧挨着墙边离她很近的地方趴着，邪恶的脸很警惕，贼亮贼亮的眼睛在盯着她。仓促间她跌跌撞撞地跑出了房间，随手把门关上了，而印花连衣裙的下摆被门挂住了，撕扯开了一条大口子。

她分明知道另一间公寓里一定有人，因为她能肯定听到了压低的说话声，有时还有笑声。她后来又悄悄来过多次，第一周她每天都过来。她在每次上班的路上，在每天的上午和晚上，在她一个人去吃晚饭的路上，都会来到这间公寓的门前，可是不管她敲多少次门，不管敲门多么用力，就是没有人过来给她开门。





女巫


车厢里几乎没什么人，小男孩一个人独占了一个座位，小男孩的妈妈坐在过道另一边的座位上，紧挨着小男孩的是他幼小的妹妹。还是婴儿的妹妹一只手里拿着面包片，另一只手里拿着不时嘎嘎作响的玩具。她被安全带固定在座位上，这样就能坐直身子，可以四处张望。每当她要慢慢倒向一侧的时候，带子就会在半途拽紧她的小身子，这时她的妈妈就会转过身子，再次把她扶正。小男孩一边吃着零食一边看着车窗外，而两个孩子的妈妈也在安静地看着书，头也不抬地回答着小男孩喋喋不休的问题。

“我们正在一条河的上面，”小男孩说道，“这是一条河，我们正在它的上面。”

“嗯。”妈妈答道。

“我们正在经过河上的一座桥。”小男孩自言自语地说道。

车厢里为数不多的几个人坐在车厢的另一头，如果有人偶尔走过过道，小男孩都会扭过头来打招呼，而陌生人也通常会回应“你好”，有时还会问问小男孩是否喜欢坐火车，甚至有人还会打趣地说他长了一个大傻个，这些话会惹恼小男孩，他生气地把头扭向窗户。

“那儿有一头奶牛，”他要么嘟囔道，要么叹口气，“还有多远我们才能到呀？”

“没多远了。”他的妈妈每一次都会这样说。

女婴一度很安静，自顾自地忙着玩玩具，吃面包片，妈妈得不时地扶正她，可她这次歪斜的幅度太大，咣的一下磕了脑袋，开始大哭了起来，一时间妈妈的座位上有了一阵骚动。小男孩从自己的座位上滑下来，跑过过道，爱抚着妹妹的小脚丫，哄着让她别哭。终于，婴儿破涕为笑，又继续啃咬面包片了，而小男孩从他妈妈那里得到了一根棒棒糖，又坐回了车窗前。

“我看见了一个女巫，”过了一小会儿，他又对妈妈说道，“外面有一个又大又老又丑又坏的女巫。”

“嗯。”妈妈应道。

“一个又大又老又丑的女巫，我让她走开，她就走开了。”小男孩继续说道，用一种几乎听不见的声音嘀咕自说自话，“她又来了，还说：‘我要把你吃掉。’而我说：‘不，你吃不掉我。’我把她赶走了，这个又坏又老又残忍的巫婆。”

这时车厢尽头的门打开了，走进来一个男人。小男孩停下了自言自语，抬头看着他。他已经上了岁数，满头白发下面是一张和和气气的脸，长途跋涉的火车旅行竟然只让他的蓝西服留下了少许的褶皱。他手里正拿着根雪茄烟，当小男孩冲他说“你好”的时候，这个男人用拿着雪茄烟的手对他做了一个手势，然后说道：“你也好呀，小家伙。”他在小男孩的座位旁停下了脚步，斜靠在座椅背上，低头看着小男孩，而小男孩也正伸长脖子向上看着。“你往窗户外看什么呢？”那个男人问道。

“一群女巫，”小男孩旋即说道，“又坏又老又残忍的巫婆们。”

“我明白了，”男人说道，“发现了不少吗？”

“我爸爸也抽雪茄烟。”小男孩说道。

“所有的男人都抽雪茄烟，”男人说道，“有朝一日你也会抽雪茄烟的。”

“我已经是男子汉了。”小男孩说道。

“你多大了？”男人问道。

对这个没完没了老是有人问的问题，小男孩警惕地看了男人一会儿，然后说道：“二十六，八百四十，八十。”

他的妈妈从书上抬起头，“他四岁了。”她说道，满脸爱怜地对着小男孩微笑着。

“是这样吗？”那男人冲着小男孩礼貌地说道，“二十六岁。”他又对过道那边的妈妈微微点了点头，“那是你妈妈吗？”

小男孩向前倾了倾身子，然后说道：“是的，那是我妈妈。”

“你叫什么名字？”男人问道。

小男孩看上去又开始警惕了。“我叫耶稣先生。”他答道。

“他叫强尼。”小男孩的妈妈说道。她想引起小男孩的注意，并冲他皱了皱眉头。

“那边那个是我的小妹妹，”小男孩对着男人说道，“她十二岁半了。”

“你爱你的小妹妹吗？”男人问道。小男孩瞪大了眼睛，看见男人来到座位前，紧挨着他坐了下来。“喂，”男人说道，“我给你讲讲我小妹妹的事吧，好吗？”

当男人坐在小男孩身边时，小男孩的妈妈有点儿担心地抬起了头，过了一会儿，她又放心地埋头看起了书。

“跟我说说你小妹妹的事吧，”小男孩说道，“她是个女巫吗？”

“也许是的。”男人说道。

小男孩兴奋地大笑着，男人斜靠着椅背，吸了一口雪茄烟。“从前，”他开始讲述了，“我有一个小妹妹，就像你的小妹妹一样。”小男孩仰头看着男人，男人每说一句话，他都点点头。“我的小妹妹，”男人继续讲道，“长得非常漂亮和可爱，我爱她胜过了世上的一切。那么，我可以告诉你我做了什么吗？”

小男孩小鸡啄米似的连连点头，男孩妈妈的目光也离开了书，微笑着倾听。

“我给她买了一个摇摇木马、一个玩具娃娃和数不清的棒棒糖，”男人说道，“后来我抓住了她，把手放在了她的脖子上，掐紧她的脖子，直到把她掐死。”

小男孩倒吸了一口凉气，男孩的妈妈也转过身，脸上的微笑消失了。她大张着嘴，然后又闭上了，听那个男人继续说道：“后来我抓住她，把她的头割了下来，我拿着她的头——”

“你把她整个都剁成块了吗？”小男孩上气不接下气地问道。

“我割下了她的头、手、脚，还有她的头发和鼻子，”男人说道，“我还用棍棒打她，我杀死了她。”

“你停一下。”男孩的妈妈说道，但就在这时，女婴向一侧倒了下去，就在妈妈把女婴扶正的当口儿，那个男人又继续说道：

“我拿着她的头颅，把她的头发都拔光了，还——”

“你就这样对你的小妹妹？”小男孩马上急切地问道。

“我就是这样对我的小妹妹的，”那个男人坚定地说道，“后来我把她的头颅放到了一个关熊的笼子里，熊把它都给吃光了。”

“把她的头都吃光了？”小男孩问道。

男孩的妈妈把书放下，冲过了过道，站在男人的身边说道：“你究竟安的什么心，怎么能说出这样的话？”男人谦恭有礼地抬头看了看她，她说道：“赶紧离开这儿。”

“我吓到你了吗？”男人说道，他低头看着小男孩，用胳膊肘轻轻地碰了碰他。男人和小男孩一起大笑了起来。

“这个男人把他的小妹妹给剁成块了。”小男孩对着他妈妈说道。

“我可要马上叫列车员了。”男孩的妈妈对着男人说道。

“列车员会吃了我妈妈，”小男孩说道，“我们会把她的头剁下来。”

“还有你小妹妹的头。”男人说道。他站起了身，男孩的妈妈后退了一步，好让他从座位上离开。“别再回这节车厢了。”她说道。

“我妈妈会吃了你。”小男孩对男人说道。

男人开口笑了起来，接着小男孩也笑了。然后，男人对男孩的妈妈说了声“借过”，走过她的身旁离开了车厢。当车厢门在他身后关上的时候，小男孩说道：“我们还要在这辆破火车上待多久呀？”

“没多久了。”妈妈说道。她站在那儿看着小男孩，想说点儿什么，但最后开口说的是：“你安静地坐会儿，做一个好孩子，也许还会得到一根棒棒糖。”

小男孩急切地爬下了座位，跟着他妈妈回到了她的座位上。她从荷包里拿出一个小袋子，从袋子里取出了一根棒棒糖，把它递给了他。“你应该说什么？”她问道。

“谢谢！”小男孩说道，“那个男人真的把他的小妹妹剁成块了吗？”

“他只是在跟你开玩笑呢，”男孩的妈妈说道，然后又急忙补了一句，“就是个玩笑。”

“也许吧，”小男孩说道，拿着棒棒糖回到了自己的座位上，屁股坐稳后又向车窗外看去，“也许他就是个女巫。”





花园


在佛蒙特州一栋古老的庄园一起共同生活了大约十一年以后，两位维宁太太——婆婆和儿媳，长得是越来越像了，因为同作为女人，她俩朝夕相处，在同一个厨房里忙碌，用同一种方式处理家里家外的大事小情。虽然年轻一些的维宁太太是塔尔博特人，一头乌发，梳着刘海，但早已正式成为维宁家——这个镇上最古老的家族——的一员了。她一头剪短了的乌发，也在她婆婆首先有头发开始变灰的地方——太阳穴两侧——开始变得灰白了。她们两个人都长着一张瘦削的面孔和一双灵巧的手，有时她俩会一起刷盘子、剥豆子或者擦拭银器，她们的双手翻动得飞快，而且动作也协调一致。她俩交流的默契超乎她们的想象。有时当年轻的维宁太太紧挨着她的婆婆坐在早餐桌旁，身旁是坐在婴儿椅中的小女儿，她会忍不住想到，这景象就像一幅新英格兰墙纸上的某种模式化的雕版印刷画，画面上有母亲、女儿和孙女，也许还有普利茅斯岩石和康科德木桥作为背景。

这一天的上午，如同许多其他寒冷的上午一样，她们不紧不慢地喝着咖啡，不愿意离开这间宽敞的厨房，因为厨房里有着炭火烧得正旺的炉子，有着让人愉快的食物的香味和干净整洁的环境。她们一声不吭地坐在那里，直到宝宝早就吃完早饭，独自安静地在一个专门为婴儿辟出的角落里玩耍。维宁家无数的孩子都曾在这个角落里玩耍，而且玩具也几乎一成不变，都来自同一个沉甸甸的木箱子。

“今年的春天好像姗姗来迟，”年轻的维宁太太说道，“我现在可受够了这种阴冷。”

“每年的这个时候都会这么冷。”她婆婆说道。她突然起身，动作敏捷地把盘子摆放整齐，表明闲坐的时间结束了，开始干活的时候到了。年轻的维宁太太也马上站起来帮忙，她已经在脑海里想过一千遍了，她的婆婆打死也不会放弃她在家中一言九鼎的地位，除非年数太大腿脚不利索，跑不到别人前面去。

“我真希望有人能搬进那栋古老的农舍去。”年轻的维宁太太又补充了一句。她在去放桌布的餐具室的半路上停了下来，满怀渴望地说道，“但愿有人能在春天到来之前搬进去。”年轻的维宁太太很早以前曾经想过自己买下那栋农舍，因为她的丈夫也想用自己的双手营造一个家，只有他们夫妻俩和孩子们一起住在那里。但是，现在她已经习惯住在这栋位于山顶的古老的大宅子了，她的婆家已经在这栋古屋中居住了好几代人了。对那栋小农舍，她剩下的只有良好的祝愿了，焦急地盼望能够目睹某对幸福的年轻人住在那里。后来她听说农舍已经售出，那些日子所有的老房子都在出售，似乎没人能找到更新一点儿的地方来居住了，于是她每天都观察有没有陌生人搬来的迹象。每天早晨她都会从屋后的门廊向下瞟上那么几眼，看看农舍的烟囱里有没有炊烟冒出；在每天她下山去商店的路上，经过农舍时，她都要仔细留意屋里是否有人影晃动。农舍是在一月份售出的，现在已经过去两个月了，虽然屋子似乎更漂亮了，一点儿也不破旧，残雪温柔地覆盖着草木过度茂盛的园子，在假窗前还有很多的冰柱，显得有些荒芜、空旷和冷清。维宁太太很早以前对它动过念头，现在已经完全放弃能住在里面的希望了。

维宁太太把桌布放进了餐具室，转身把厨房的日历又撕掉了一页，然后拿了一块擦碗布，和她婆婆一起在水槽边刷洗起来。“已经是三月份了。”她沮丧地说道。

“昨天在山下的商店里，他们的确跟我说了，”她婆婆说道，“他们这周就要开始粉刷那栋农舍了。”

“那就是说有人要搬进来了！”

“不会那么快，还要花上好几个星期去粉刷那小屋的里面。”老维宁太太说道。

可是，都快到四月了，新的住户还没有搬进来。雪几乎已经融化，在街上以半是雪水、半是冰溜子的形式像小河般流淌。道路泥泞很难走，天空也是灰蒙蒙、阴沉沉的。再过一个月，第一抹让人惊喜的嫩绿会在树枝上萌发，会在地面上露头，但是在四月的大部分时候，天还是会下冰冷的雨，也许还有更多的雪。农舍的内部已经粉刷完毕，也贴好了新的墙纸。门前的台阶修葺一新，破了的窗户也装上了新玻璃。尽管天空依然阴沉，脏兮兮的积雪也一块块的随处可见，但农舍看起来却显得更加整洁和挺拔。在天气晴朗的时候，粉刷匠们会再回来粉刷外墙。维宁太太站在农舍屋脚下的小路上，试图想象出此时矗立在这儿的房屋里里外外会是什么样子，和她多年前想自己要是能住在这里，会把它装饰成什么样子做个对比。她会在门廊的四周种上玫瑰，新的主人可能也会这么做。她曾计划把花园整饬得整整齐齐，五彩缤纷。她会把外墙刷成白色，说不定新主人也有同样的想法。自从这间农舍被售出以后，她再也没进去过，但是她清楚地记得屋里的几个小房间的位置，房间的窗户位于花园的上方，如果窗帘用色彩艳丽的布料制成，窗户外的花箱里种些鲜花，房间一定会显得非常明亮和温馨。小厨房她会刷成黄色的，还有楼上的两间卧室，里面位于屋檐下的天花板是倾斜的，把它也刷成黄色。维宁太太站在湿漉漉的小道上，久久地注视着农舍，过了大半天才慢慢地走向商店。

几天以后，终于从杂货店主那里传来了消息，她听说的第一条消息就是有陌生人到来了。当时，他正在用绳子捆一堆三磅重的汉堡，维宁家人口多，一顿就能吃完这些汉堡。他用快乐的声调问维宁太太：“见着你的新邻居了吗？”

“他们已经搬进去了？”维宁太太问道，“住在农舍的那家人吗？”

“今天早晨，有位女士来这儿了，”杂货店主说道，“那位女士带着个小男孩，看上去挺不错的母子俩，听人们说她的丈夫去世了。那位女士长得蛮好看的。”

维宁太太就出生在这座小镇，现在的这个店主还在上高中的时候，他的父亲就已经经营着杂货店了，她经常来买硬球糖和甘草糖。有一阵子，她十二岁，店主的儿子二十岁，维宁太太曾私下里幻想他会娶她。如今他已人到中年了，也发福了，虽然他还称呼她海伦，她也仍叫他汤姆，但她现在已经成了维宁家的媳妇了，如果店里卖的肉太老或者黄油的价太高，不管心里多么不情愿，她也不得不挖苦他几句。她心里清楚，如果他把这位新邻居称为“女士”，肯定和把她称为“女人”或者“某人”有着截然不同的意味。维宁太太明白当他向其他顾客谈到两位维宁太太时，他就会把她们称为“女士们”。她犹豫了一下，然后问道：“他们真的搬进去住下了吗？”

“她会住上一段日子的，”店主干巴巴地说道，“买了够用一周的杂货了。”

拿着买的东西，走在回山顶的路上，维宁太太一路都在留神观察住在农舍的那家人的迹象。当来到农舍前面的小道时，她放慢了脚步，想再近距离观察一下，但又不想做得太过于明显。烟囱里没有冒烟，房屋附近也没有家具的影子，如果有人正在搬家，应该可以看到家具。但是农舍前面的街上只有一辆半新不旧的小汽车停在那里，维宁太太寻思她能看到在窗户处有人影来回走动。在一阵突如其来而又无法抑制的冲动驱使下，她转身沿着小道走向门廊，然后，经过一番思想斗争，又抬脚走上了门前的台阶。她敲了敲门，用一只胳膊挎着她的购物袋。这时门开了，她低头看见了一个小男孩，她的心头暗喜，这男孩和她儿子的岁数差不多。

“你好！”维宁太太说道。

“您好！”男孩回应道，很严肃地看着她。

“你妈妈在家吗？”维宁太太问道，“我是来看看你们搬家时能帮上什么忙的。”

“我们全都搬完了。”男孩说道。他马上要关上门了，这时却从屋里传来了一个女人的声音，“戴维？你正在和什么人说话吗？”

“那是我妈妈。”小男孩说道。这时在他的身后出现了一个女人，她把门缝开得更大了些。“您有什么事吗？”她问道。

维宁太太赶忙说道：“我叫海伦·维宁，住在这条街上面跟这儿隔三栋房子的地方，我想也许我能给您帮上点儿忙。”

“谢谢您！”女人不无疑虑地说道。维宁太太心想，她比我要年轻，大约三十岁左右的样子，而且挺漂亮。只用了一小会儿，维宁太太就明白了为什么店主会把她称为一位女士。

“有人住进这栋房子真是太好了。”维宁太太有点儿不好意思地说道。越过那个女人的头顶，她能看见一小段并不宽敞的走廊，走廊的尽头是一间较大的客厅，通过左手的门可以进到厨房，右边是楼梯，细细的楼梯栏杆新刷了油漆。他们已经把门厅刷成了淡绿色。维宁太太冲着门口的女人友好地笑了笑，暗自思忖，她把房子拾掇得不错，本来就应该这么做，她知道怎么把房子布置得漂亮。

过了一会儿，这个女人也报以微笑，并说道：“您愿意进来坐坐吗？”

她往后退了一步，好让维宁太太进来。维宁太太突然良心有愧似的，想知道自己该不该进屋，可是几乎像有某种力量推着她进了门……“我希望自己不要惹人烦，”她转向对方，有些突兀地说道，“我一直想自己能住在这儿就好了，这个念头有很长时间了。”她很奇怪自己为什么会这样说。年轻时的维宁太太会把自己脑子里想的事不假思索地说出来，可那已经是很久以前的事了。

“来看看我的房间吧。”小男孩急切地说道，维宁太太低头向他微笑着。

“我有一个儿子，岁数和你差不多，”她说道，“你叫什么名字？”

“戴维，”小男孩说道，往他妈妈的身旁又靠了靠，“戴维·威廉·麦克莱恩。”

“我的小儿子，”维宁太太一本正经地说，“名叫霍华德·塔尔博特·维宁。”

小男孩有点儿迟疑地抬头看着妈妈，而维宁太太在这栋她心仪已久的小屋子里觉得有点儿不自在和尴尬，为了掩饰她又问道：“你几岁了？我的小儿子五岁。”

“我也五岁了。”小男孩说道，好像第一次认识到这一点，他又看了看他妈妈。而他的妈妈和善地说道：“您是否愿意进来看看我们对屋子做了哪些修饰和改动？”

维宁太太把她的购物袋放在绿色门厅的一张细腿桌子上，跟着麦克莱恩太太进了客厅，客厅是L形状的，四下都有窗户。要是维宁太太是这儿的女主人的话，她会选择色彩艳丽的窗帘，窗下还要有花箱。当她走进客厅时，维宁太太很快就又惊又喜地舒了口气，不管怎么说，她意识到房里的一切都布置得妥帖完美。从壁炉里的炭架到桌子上的图书，每件物品，如果维宁太太能再年轻十一岁的话，她也会做出一模一样的布置和安排。虽然房里的陈设看上去比她更加随意，也许东西也不像年轻时的维宁太太挑选的那样都是高品质的，但是仍然显得富丽堂皇，无可争辩地恰到好处。壁炉台上摆放着一张戴维的照片，旁边还有一张，维宁太太猜想可能是戴维的父亲。在低矮的咖啡桌上，放着一只精美的蓝碗，在L形客厅的拐角处有一排架子，架子上放着一溜橙色的盘子；客厅中间是一张锃光瓦亮的枫木桌子和几把椅子。

“真不错。”维宁太太说道。“这一切本来应该是我的呀。”她不无妒忌地暗自寻思。站住门口，她又忍不住说了一遍，“真是很完美。”

麦克莱恩太太穿过客厅走到壁炉旁的一把小扶手椅前，拿起了搭在椅背上的柔软的蓝色布料，“我正在做窗帘，”她说道，然后用一只指尖碰了碰蓝瓷碗，“我总是爱把蓝碗放在房间的中央，”她说道，“我正在做的窗帘也用的是一模一样的蓝色，还有地毯——等它送到了——也特意用的是相同的蓝色。”

“和戴维眼睛的蓝色很相配。”维宁太太说道，当麦克莱恩太太又露出微笑时，她看到麦克莱恩太太的眼睛也是湛蓝的。看来自己什么忙也帮不上了，这一点让她觉得不可思议。维宁太太问道：“你把厨房刷成黄色了吗？”

“是的，”麦克莱恩太太有点儿吃惊地说道，“过来看一下吧。”她在前面领路穿过L形的客厅，绕过摆满橙色盘子的架子就到了厨房。里面洒满了快接近正午的阳光，新刷的油漆和明亮的铝制品把厨房照得格外亮堂。维宁太太注意到了电咖啡壶、华夫饼铛、烤面包机，要是她自己的话，才不会那么费事去做饭呢，她只需要其中的两件厨具就足够了。

“等把花园拾掇出来，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“我们差不多从四面的窗户都能欣赏到花园的景色。”她对厨房宽大的窗户做了个手势，补充道，“我喜欢花园，我觉得我会把大部分时间用在收拾花园上，只要天气一变暖，我就动手干。”

“这栋房子有这么个花园真好，”维宁太太说道，“我听说它曾经是这条街道上最漂亮的花园之一。”

“我也这么认为，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“我跟你说，我要把房屋的四周全都种上花。把这栋农舍装扮得能有多漂亮就有多漂亮。”

哦，我知道，我当然知道。维宁太太充满憧憬地想象，她至今还耿耿于怀，本来她应该拥有这个整洁迷人的花园，她会沿着维宁庄园在前面种上一溜旱金莲花，并且精心地呵护它们。但实际上，维宁庄园四周的花儿根本不怎么生长，因为庄园的院子里长满了郁郁葱葱古老的枫树，把阳光都遮住了。在修建庄园的房屋时，树木都已经长得很高大了。

麦克莱恩太太让人把楼上的大卫生间也刷成了黄色，而把两个有着外伸房檐的小卧室刷成了绿色和玫瑰色。“都是花园中花的颜色。”她愉快地跟维宁太太说道。而维宁太太联想到了高大的维宁庄园中搭配古怪、简朴刻板的一间间卧室，心中叹了口气，不得不承认在房檐下的窗户旁摆上几把椅子那真是绝妙的想法。戴维的卧室也是绿色的，他的床紧挨着窗户。“今天早上，”他正儿八经地告诉维宁太太，“我向外看，看见有四个冰柱子悬挂在我的床头。”

维宁太太在这房屋里盘桓的时间有点儿太长了，她自己都意识到了这一点。虽然麦克莱恩太太真心而又愉快地邀请她参观房子的每一个房间，但是她的来访已经不是出于礼节，而更多的是出于好奇了。即使是这样，最终让她下决心离开的还是突然冒上来的愧疚感，因为她购物袋中还装着三磅的汉堡，中午还需要为维宁家的男人们准备午饭。她离开时，挥手跟站在农舍门口的麦克莱恩太太和戴维告别，她已经邀请了戴维上山找霍华德玩，也邀请了麦克莱恩太太来家里喝茶，同时还邀请他们两个有朝一日来家里共进午餐，而且所有的这些邀请都还是在未经她婆婆许可的情况下发出的。

她很不情愿地走回了庄园的大宅子，绕过闩上了的前门，走上通往后门的小道，在冬天家里的所有人都通过后门进出。她走进厨房，婆婆抬头看着她，有些不高兴地说：“我给店里打了电话，汤姆说你一个小时以前就离开了。”

“我在老农舍那儿待了一会儿。”维宁太太说道。她把装满杂货的购物袋放到桌子上，动作麻利地把东西都拿了出来，把炸面圈放到一个盘子里，把汉堡放到了平底锅里，完成这一切只用了一小会儿工夫。她没换外套，只是把头巾围在了头上，尽可能利索地忙活了起来，而她的婆婆一边在厨房的桌子上切着面包，一边默默地注视着她。

“去把你的外套脱了吧，”她婆婆终于忍不住开口说道，“你丈夫一会儿就该回来了。”

到了十二点的时候，屋里人声嘈杂起来，厨房的地板上到处是泥脚印。最年长的霍华德，也就是维宁太太的公公，从农场回来了，在跟他妻子和儿媳说话之前，他会悄无声息地进到黑黢黢的厅中，挂上他的帽子和外套。而年轻一些的霍华德——维宁太太的丈夫——则把卡车停好，从车库回来，冲妻子点点头，亲吻了一下母亲的脸颊。最小的霍华德——维宁太太的儿子——从幼儿园回来，冲进厨房，大声喊叫着：“饭在哪儿呢？”

最小的女儿也在等着喂吃的，在高脚婴儿椅上把银制的小碗敲得震天响，这个银碗是从老霍华德母亲那辈传下来的。维宁太太和她的婆婆迅速地把锅碗瓢勺摆上了餐桌，多年的经验已经让她们知道了谁最后一个回来，什么时候该上饭，以及两者之间准确的时间空当，也清楚维宁家的三代人能够安静和有效地把午饭一扫而光的最短时间，因为所有人都急着回去继续工作：农场的活儿、磨坊的活儿、电动火车的游戏，以及她们俩需要的洗洗涮涮、缝缝补补，还有午觉的时间。维宁太太一边喂着女婴，一边指望她婆婆能过来帮把手，不知为什么她今天心里比以往更加觉得委屈，心想她至少为霍华德家添丁进口，孩子们长着霍华德家人的眼睛和嘴，才换来自己在这个家里有口饭吃，有张床睡。

午饭之后，男人们回去工作了，孩子们也要午睡一会儿了。女婴打起了盹，而小霍华德身边放着蜡笔和彩色图书，也睡着了。维宁太太和她婆婆坐在一起做着针线活，她想描述一下农舍的状况。

“屋里的陈设称得上完美，”她啧啧地说道，“每件东西都那么漂亮。当房子彻底完工，装上了窗帘，把其他东西也都置办齐了的时候，她邀请我们找一天过去看看。”

“我和布莱克太太聊过，”老维宁太太说道，好像认同她的说法，“她说那个女人的丈夫在一场车祸中丧生了，她的名下有一些钱，我想她决定住在乡下是为了她儿子的健康。布莱克太太说，他看上去很瘦弱。”

“她喜欢花园，”维宁太太说道，针停在手中好一会儿，“她要弄个大花园，围着那座房子。”

“那她可需要帮手，”老太太认真地说道，“她那个园子可真是不小。”

“她有一个世上最漂亮的蓝瓷碗，婆婆，你肯定会喜欢的，它跟银制的差不多一样。”

“也许吧，”老维宁太太停顿了一会儿说道，“也许她来这里是寻根的，那就是为什么她要在这个地方定居下来。”

第二天，维宁太太在经过农舍时又慢下了脚步，接下来的一天也放缓了步伐，第三天、第四天都是如此。在第二天的时候，她看见麦克莱恩太太出现在窗户边，于是挥了挥手。在第三天的时候，她在辅路上遇到了戴维。“你什么时候来跟我的小儿子玩呀？”她问他，而他则很郑重地盯着她说道：“明天。”

博尔顿太太住在麦克莱恩一家的隔壁，她在第三天短暂地造访了麦克莱恩一家。母子俩当时正在吃一个新做的苹果派，随后，博尔顿太太告诉了所有邻居，新搬来的一家人有着黄色的厨房和明亮的电器。另一位邻居，她的丈夫曾经帮助麦克莱恩太太把火炉生起来，解释说麦克莱恩太太只是最近才守寡的。一两个镇上的人几乎每天都去麦克莱恩家串门，他们频频出入，以至于当维宁太太路过的时候，都能在窗户边看到很多熟悉的面孔在和麦克莱恩太太比画着蓝色的窗帘。她经常向正和麦克莱恩太太聊天的熟人们挥手打招呼，这些人站在门前台阶上，显然现在新砌的台阶水泥已经干透。在麦克莱恩一家搬到农舍大约一周之后，维宁太太有一天在杂货店里碰到了这对母子俩。买完东西后，他们一起向小山走去，维宁太太谈到应该把戴维送到幼儿园去，而麦克莱恩太太想只要有可能就把孩子留在家里，维宁太太问她：“一直把他带在身边，你不觉得累得慌吗？”

“我喜欢这样，”麦克莱恩太太开心地说，“我们俩可以彼此做伴。”这时维宁太太才觉出自己的话有些唐突和失礼，她想起了麦克莱恩太太寡妇的身份。

当天气变得越发暖和的时候，树上和潮湿的土壤中都吐出了新绿，维宁太太和麦克莱恩太太成了好朋友。她们几乎每天都在杂货店中见面，然后一起步行上山。戴维一周至少两次要上山去和霍华德玩电动火车，麦克莱恩太太接他的时候，就留在维宁太太家的大厨房里喝上一杯咖啡，而两个男孩子会围着餐桌追逐打闹。在这个时候，维宁太太的婆婆往往是在邻居家串门。

“真是一个古老的屋子，”麦克莱恩太太一边仰头看着黑黢黢的屋顶，一边说道，“我喜欢古屋，它们让人觉得安全和温暖，好像很多人都特别满意这些古屋，他们知道它们是多么实用，在新房子里你就不会有那种感觉。”

“这是个沉闷乏味的老宅子。”维宁太太说道。麦克莱恩太太穿着一件玫瑰色的毛衣，她金色柔顺的头发是厨房中不多的亮色，维宁太太知道她自己是无法复制这种色彩的。“我愿意放弃世界上的一切去换取能住在你目前的房子中。”维宁太太说道。

“我也喜欢它，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“我从未觉得像现在这么开心过。这儿的每个人都那么善良，房子也这么漂亮，我昨天种了很多球茎类植物。”她开口笑了起来，“我过去常常坐在纽约的公寓里，梦想着能再次养些球茎类植物。”

维宁太太望着两个孩子，心想霍华德竟然比戴维高出半个头，也结实得多。而戴维个头很矮，也很单薄，还总爱黏着他妈妈。“这儿对戴维也有好处，现在都能看出点儿效果了，他的双颊开始红润起来了。”

“戴维也喜欢这儿。”麦克莱恩太太点头同意。听见有人叫他的名字，戴维跑了过来，把头依偎在她的膝头。她抚摸着他的头发，儿子的头发和她一样也是明亮的金色。“我们该回家了，戴维宝贝！”她说道。

“我们的花儿长得比昨天更高了。”戴维说道。




日子逐渐变得令人不可思议的漫长和温暖了，麦克莱恩太太的花园开始显现出各种颜色，也显得井然有序了，虽然花草依然弱小和具有不确定性，但是到了夏天结束的时候，五颜六色的花朵盛开将指日可待，下一个夏天也将会如此，此后的十年中所有的夏天都会如此。

“它甚至比我料想的还要好，”麦克莱恩太太站在花园的门前，对着维宁太太说道，“在这儿生长的一切东西都比别的地方茁壮得多。”

戴维和霍华德暑假里每天都在一起玩耍，霍华德整天自由自在，有时他会待在戴维的家里吃午饭，他们有时会在麦克莱恩家的后院开垦出一小块土地一起种蔬菜。维宁太太每天上午在去商店的路上等着麦克莱恩太太一起去，而戴维和霍华德沿着街道在她们的前头嬉戏玩闹。她们一起去取邮件，一边读着一边向山上走去，和麦克莱恩太太回家同行一大截路，维宁太太回到空旷的维宁庄园后会幸福异常。

一天午后，维宁太太把婴儿放在霍华德的小推车上，她们和两个男孩子一起，在乡间的小路上走了很长一段，麦克莱恩太太摘了一朵野胡萝卜花，把花放在小车上的婴儿旁边，而男孩们发现了一条束带蛇，想把蛇弄回家。在上山的路上，麦克莱恩太太帮忙拉着有婴儿和野胡萝卜花的小车，他们在半山腰停下来休息的时候，麦克莱恩太太说道：“看呀，我相信你从这儿可以完整地看得到我的花园。”

几乎快到山顶的地方，有一片彩色的田地，他们站在那儿遥望着，这时婴儿把野胡萝卜花扔出了小车。麦克莱恩太太说道：“我总是想停在这儿来欣赏它。”她马上又问了一句，“那个漂亮的小孩是谁呀？”

维宁太太顺着她的手望去，然后笑了起来，“他很迷人，不是吗？”她说道，“那是比利·琼斯。”她自己仔细地看着他，就像麦克莱恩太太那样想看清他的模样。他是一个大约十二岁的男孩，安静地坐在横跨街道的一堵墙上，双手托着下巴，正默默地看着戴维和霍华德。

“他就像一座年轻的雕像，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“肤色是那么黝黑，你能看得清那张脸吗？”为了把他看得更清楚些，她再次迈开脚步，维宁太太紧跟着她，“我认识他的父母吗？”

“琼斯家的孩子有一半黑人的血统，”维宁太太急忙说道，“但是他们长得都很漂亮，你应该见过他家的女孩。他们就住在镇外。”

霍华德的声音穿过夏天的空气清晰地传到了她们的耳畔。“黑鬼，”他正在喊道，“黑鬼，黑鬼男孩。”

“黑鬼。”戴维咯咯笑着跟着学。

麦克莱恩太太倒吸了口气，而后叫道：“戴维。”她声音严厉，戴维吓了一跳，转过头来。维宁太太以前从未听过她的朋友用这种声音说话，她也吃惊地看着麦克莱恩太太。

“戴维，”麦克莱恩太太又叫了一遍，戴维慢吞吞地靠了过来，“你刚才说什么呢？”

“霍华德，”维宁太太说道，“别去招惹比利。”

“去跟那个男孩说对不起，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“马上过去，跟他说你很抱歉。”

戴维眼泪汪汪地看着他妈妈，然后走到人行道的边上，冲着街那边喊道：“对不起。”

霍华德和维宁太太不安地愣在那里，街道另一边的比利·琼斯不再双手托着下巴，而是抬起头看着戴维，然后，过了很长时间，又看了看麦克莱恩太太，接着又用双手托住了下巴。

突然，麦克莱恩太太喊道：“小伙子——能请你过来一下吗？”

维宁太太吃了一惊，瞪大眼睛看着麦克莱恩太太，但是看到街道那头的男孩并没有挪动身子，维宁太太尖声喊道：“比利！比利·琼斯！马上过来！”

男孩抬起头，看着他们，然后慢慢从墙上滑了下来，穿过街道走了过来，可就在距离他们大约五英尺的地方，他站住了，等待着。

“你好，”麦克莱恩太太柔声说道，“你叫什么名字？”

男孩看了她一会儿，又把目光转移到维宁太太身上，而维宁太太说道：“他叫比利·琼斯。比利，别人问你话时，你要回答。”

“比利，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“我很抱歉，我儿子刚才对你出言不逊，他还太小，他对自己说了什么还不明白，但是他也觉得很抱歉。”

“没关系。”比利说道，眼睛仍然盯着维宁太太。他穿着一条旧的蓝色牛仔裤和一件破了的白衬衣，光着脚。他的皮肤和头发一个颜色，浓重的黑色上面笼罩着一层金色，他的头发稍微有些鬈曲，如同花园中的雕像。

“比利，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“你愿意过来为我干些活吗？捎带挣些零花钱？”

“当然愿意。”比利说道。

“你喜欢干些园丁的活吗？”麦克莱恩太太问道，比利认真地点了点头。“因为，”麦克莱恩太太继续热情地说道，“我一直需要人来帮我照料花园，这活儿挺适合你的。”她等了一会儿，又问道：“你知道我住在哪儿吗？”

“我知道，”比利说道，他的目光从维宁太太身上转移开，又看了麦克莱恩太太一会儿，但褐色眼睛里没有流露出什么感情。然后，他又把目光转回到维宁太太身上，后者正在注视着沿着街往上走的霍华德。

“那好，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“你愿意明天就来吗？”

“没问题。”比利说道。他等了一会儿，目光来回在麦克莱恩太太和维宁太太身上转来转去，然后又转身穿过街道，跑了回去，双手一撑越过了他一直坐着的那堵墙。麦克莱恩太太羡慕地看着他，然后对着维宁太太微笑着，用力拉着小车，再次把它往小山上拉去。快到麦克莱恩家的农舍前时，麦克莱恩太太才终于又开口了，“我就是不能忍受，”她说道，“听见孩子们为了别人不能左右的事情而攻击他们。”

“琼斯一家人都很奇怪，”维宁太太轻描淡写地说道，“孩子的父亲到处打零工；也许你见过他，你知道——”她压低了声音——“孩子的母亲是个白人，娘家就在附近，是个本地的姑娘。”为了让一个外来的人能更明白些，她又继续说道：“在比利大约两岁的时候，她扔下一群年幼的儿女，又和一个白人私奔了。”

“可怜的孩子们。”麦克莱恩太太说道。

“他们过得还不错，”维宁太太说道，“教会收留了他们，当然，人们也总是接济他们。他们家的女儿现在也已经到了可以工作的年龄了，她十六岁了，但是……”

“但是什么？”当维宁太太吞吞吐吐的时候，麦克莱恩太太问道。

“呃，你知道，人们对她的议论很多，”维宁太太说道，“毕竟，考虑到她有那样一个母亲。他们家还有一个男孩，比比利要大好几岁。”

他们在麦克莱恩家的房子前停下了脚步，麦克莱恩太太摸了摸戴维的头发，“可怜的不幸的孩子。”她说道。

“小孩子们还会辱骂他们，”维宁太太说道，“这没有办法。”

“呃……”麦克莱恩太太说道，“可怜的孩子。”




第二天，洗过碗和盘子后，维宁太太和她婆婆把这些餐具归位。老维宁太太漫不经心地说道：“布莱克太太告诉我说你的朋友麦克莱恩太太正在四下里跟邻居们打听如何找到比利。”

“我觉得她想找人帮忙照料花园，”维宁太太嗫嚅道，“那么个大园子，她需要有人帮忙。”

“那也不应该找那样的人帮忙，”老维宁太太说道，“你告诉她他们的情况了吗？”

“她似乎觉得他们很可怜，”维宁太太在餐具室的最里边说道，为了理清思路，她花了很长时间把盘子摆放在平整的架子上。她真不应该这样做，维宁太太暗地里想，但是她的内心又拒绝说出不应该这样做的原因。最后，维宁太太想：她应该先问问我的意见。

第二天，在和麦克莱恩太太一起从商店返回山上时，维宁太太在麦克莱恩太太家停下来小坐了会儿。她们坐在黄色的厨房里喝着咖啡，两个男孩在院子里玩着。当她们讨论在苹果树间装吊床的可能性时，听见有人敲厨房的门，麦克莱恩太太把门打开，发现有个男人正站在那儿，于是她很有礼貌地问道：“您有什么事？”然后等着对方回答。

“早上好。”那个男人说道。他摘下帽子，向麦克莱恩太太点头致意。“比利告诉我您正在找料理您园子的帮工，”他说道。

“对，可是……”麦克莱恩太太开始感觉有些奇怪，环顾四周，不安地瞟了一眼维宁太太。

“我是比利的父亲。”那个男人说道。他对后院的方向点头示意，麦克莱恩太太看到比利·琼斯正坐在一棵苹果树下，双臂交叉放在胸前，眼睛盯着脚下的草地。

“您好！”麦克莱恩太太有点儿窘迫地打着招呼。

“比利告诉我，您跟他说让他来您的园子做帮工。”男人说道，“嗯，我觉得夏天的活对于他这样年纪的孩子可能太重了，这么好的天气，他应该在外面玩耍。这种活儿我经常干，所以我想亲自过来看看有什么我能干的活儿。”

他是个高大的男人，比利和他长得很像。只是比利的头发仅是稍微鬈曲，而他父亲是一头紧密的鬈发，他的前额有一道印，是长期戴帽子留下的；比利的皮肤是古铜色的，而他父亲的皮肤则要黑得多，快成黑炭了。但是他的举手投足却很优雅，他的眼睛和比利一样是深不见底的褐色。“比如在这个园子里做园丁，”琼斯先生边说，边向四下打量，“我会把园子拾掇得漂漂亮亮的。”

“您能来真是太好了，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“我的的确确需要找人帮忙。”

维宁太太沉默地坐着，不想在琼斯先生面前开口说话。她还在思忖：我真希望她能先问问我，这是不可能的……琼斯先生也默默地站在那儿，当麦克莱恩太太说话时，他注视着她，谦恭地聆听着。“我也觉得对于像比利这样的男孩来说，活儿实在有点儿太多了，”她说道，“但是有很多活儿我自己又做不了，我是一直希望能够找人给我帮忙。”

“那样的话就太好了。”琼斯先生说道，“我想我能胜任大部分的工作。”他微笑着说道。

“那好，”麦克莱恩太太说道，“那就这样说定了，您什么时候可以开始工作？”

“现在就开始怎么样？”他说道。

“好极了。”麦克莱恩太太热情洋溢地说道。然后她转过身对着维宁太太又说道：“请您稍等我一分钟。”她把她的园丁手套和一顶宽大的草帽从门边的架子上取了下来，跨出房门走进了花园里。当经过琼斯先生的身旁时，他向后侧了侧身子，而麦克莱恩太太开心地对他说：“今天的天儿真不错，对吧？”

“你现在该回家了，比尔。”当他们走向房子一侧时，琼斯先生喊道。

“哦，干吗不让他待在这儿呢？”麦克莱恩太太说道。他们走出了维宁太太的视线，但她还能听见麦克莱恩太太的声音，“他可以在花园周围玩，他可能喜欢……”

过了一会儿，维宁太太坐直身子望着花园，看见在花园的一角，琼斯先生跟着麦克莱恩太太。然后，霍华德的小脸出现在门边，他喊道：“嘿，快到吃饭的时间了吧？”

“霍华德，”维宁太太用平和的声音叫道，他从门后过来走近了她，“到了你自己跑回家的时候了。”维宁太太说道，“我随后就回。”

霍华德开始很不乐意，但她又说道：“我想让你马上就走，如果你觉得能拿得动的话，把购物袋也带回去。”

霍华德觉得有点沾沾自喜，在他母亲眼中他可能壮得像头小牛犊。他扛起了购物袋。他的肩膀和他的身子相比，宽阔得不太成比例，就跟他父亲和爷爷的一样，在重压之下，肩头绷紧了肌肉，他站稳了脚步，“我挺强壮吧？”他兴高采烈地问道。

“很强壮，”维宁太太说道，“告诉奶奶，我跟麦克莱恩太太说声再见后就马上回去。”

霍华德走出了房间，维宁太太听见他在那袋食品的重量下走得脚步沉重，从开着的前门又下了房前的台阶。当麦克莱恩太太回来的时候，维宁太太已经站起身，正站在厨房的门旁边。

“你不会是要走吧？”麦克莱恩太太看到维宁太太已经穿好了外套，忍不住喊了起来，“你的咖啡还没喝完呢？”

“我最好去追霍华德，”维宁太太说道，“他前脚刚走。”

“我真抱歉把你一个人留在这儿，”麦克莱恩太太说道，她站在门口，站在维宁太太的身边，向着花园方向望去，“这花园多漂亮呀！”她一边说，一边开心地咧嘴笑。

她们一块穿过房间向门口走去，蓝色的窗帘现在已经拉了上去，有着蓝色图案的地毯正铺在地板上。

“再见。”维宁太太在门前的台阶上跟麦克莱恩太太道别。

麦克莱恩太太正在微笑着，顺着她的目光，维宁太太转身看到了琼斯先生的身影，他的衬衫已经脱了，阳光照耀在他健壮的脊梁上，他正在房子的一侧弯着腰挥舞着镰刀割青草。比利在附近灌木丛的阴影下躺着，和一只灰色的小猫正嬉戏着。“我将拥有镇上最好的花园。”麦克莱恩太太自豪地说。

“过了今天，你不会让他继续在这儿干活了吧，对吗？”维宁太太问道，“你当然不会让他干下去的，就到今天为止了，是吧？”

“可是，我肯定——”麦克莱恩太太开始辩解，带着宽容的微笑。而维宁太太用怀疑的目光看了她一会儿，然后转过身，气愤而又尴尬地开始向山上走去。

霍华德已经把买的东西安全地带回了家，她的婆婆也摆好了桌子。

“霍华德说你让他一个人从麦克莱恩家回来的，”她的婆婆责怪道，维宁太太只简短地回了一句，“我觉得天有点儿晚了。”




第二天一早，维宁太太在下山去商店的路上经过农舍附近，看见琼斯先生正很娴熟地挥动着镰刀割房屋另一侧的杂草，比利·琼斯和戴维正坐在门前的台阶上看着他干活。“早上好，戴维。”维宁太太喊道，“你妈妈已经准备好去上街了吗？”

“霍华德在哪儿？”戴维问道，头也没抬。

“他今天和他奶奶待在家里了，”维宁太太开心地问道，“你妈妈准备好了吗？”

“她正在给比利和我做柠檬饮料呢，”戴维答道，“我们打算拿到花园里去喝。”

“那么你告诉她，”维宁太太赶忙说道，“告诉她我说的我赶时间，不得不先走了，我回头再见她。”她匆忙向山下走去。

在杂货店，她碰见了哈里斯太太，她的母亲以前给老维宁太太帮工，都快有四十年了。“海伦，”哈里斯太太说道，“每一年你都会添不少白发，不应该再这么东跑西颠的了。”

维宁太太几周以来第一次没有和麦克莱恩太太一起逛商店，她不好意思地微微一笑，告诉哈里斯太太她自己也认为应该好好地度个假了。

“赶紧度假吧！”哈里斯太太说，“让你老公去做做家务，该换换班啦。他反正也没别的事可做。”

她大声笑了起来，摇了摇头，“没别的事可做，”她说道，“对于维宁一家来说，门也没有！”

在维宁太太走开之前，哈里斯太太又追问道：“你那个衣着光鲜的朋友去哪儿了？你平常不是和她一起上街的吗？”哈里斯太太的笑声中似乎透着一种突如其来的好奇。

维宁太太礼貌地微笑着，而哈里斯太太又大声笑了起来，说道：“我简直不敢相信她能穿出那样的鞋，我第一次见的时候，都无法相信自己的眼睛。”

趁她再次放声大笑的时候，维宁太太赶紧逃到了肉类柜台，开始急切地和店主讨论起了猪腿肉的营养价值问题。哈里斯太太只是说了别人正在传的话罢了。她开始寻思，她们都是像那样谈论麦克莱恩太太的吗？她们都在嘲笑她吗？每当想起麦克莱恩太太，她就会想起那栋安静的屋子，屋里柔和的色彩，以及在花园中的母子。麦克莱恩太太的鞋是绿黄相间的高跟凉鞋，样子虽然有点儿怪，但和自己纯白牛津鞋很相近，而且毫无疑问和麦克莱恩太太的房子，以及她的花园很搭配……

哈里斯太太又走到了她的身后，开口笑着说道：“看她都干了什么呀，听说她现在让琼斯那家伙给她帮工呢？”

维宁太太回到了家。在上山路过农舍时，她匆匆而过，也正好看见麦克莱恩太太家里好像没人。她的婆婆正在房前等着她，看见她走完最后几码。“今天够早的呀，”她的婆婆说道，“麦克莱恩没去镇上？”

维宁太太只是愤愤不平地说：“哈里斯太太几乎用她的闲言碎语把我逼出了商店。”

“露西·哈里斯的毛病算是改不了了，也难怪她的男人离开了她。”老维宁太太说道。然后，她们一起绕过房子向后门走去。当她们路过后院的时候，维宁太太注意到树下的青草已经变得绿油油的了，房屋一侧的旱金莲花也开得分外鲜艳。

“我还有事要跟你说，海伦。”最后，老维宁太太开口说道。

“什么事？”维宁太太问道。

“麦克莱恩家的那位太太，我的意思是有关她的事。你和她很熟，你应该说说她，关于那个黑人在她家干活的事。”

“我想我跟她说过。”维宁太太说道。

“你确定你告诉她了吗？你告诉过她有关那些人的事了吗？”

“我告诉过她了。”维宁太太说道。

“他每天都去那儿，”她的婆婆说道，“光着脊梁在屋外工作，甚至这样进到屋里。”

有一天傍晚，博尔顿先生，也是麦克莱恩太太隔壁的邻居，顺便来这里看望霍华德·维宁一家，也想顺便从磨坊里拿些新的屋顶板。突然，他转过身看着维宁太太，后者正坐在前厅的桌边，挨着她婆婆做着针线活。博尔顿先生在说话的时候，故意把声音提高了一些，“海伦，我希望你能告诉你的朋友麦克莱恩太太，让她的孩子离我的菜地远点儿。”

“是戴维吗？”维宁太太不由自主地问道。

“不。”博尔顿先生说道。这时维宁家的所有人都看着年轻的维宁太太。“不是，是另外一个，那个黑男孩，他像一匹脱缰的野马在我的后院里疯跑。这让我很生气，你知道，那个孩子过来就是毁坏别人家的财产的。”然后，他转过身对着霍华德·维宁一家又补充道，“你知道，这真令人生气。”屋里一阵沉默，接着博尔顿先生缓缓地站起身，又说道：“我想应该向各位说晚安了。”

他们一家人把他送到门口，回来在一片沉默中继续忙着手里的活儿。“我必须做点儿什么了。”维宁太太心里想。很快，他们首先会疏远我，然后让别的人找我谈话。她抬起头，发现她婆婆也正在看着她，很快她们两人又都把头低了下去。

结果，第二天早上，维宁太太去商店的时间比往常早得多，她和霍华德穿过了正位于麦克莱恩家房子上面的那条街，从另一边的小道下了山。

“我们不去看戴维了吗？”霍华德立刻问道，而维宁太太有意无意地说道：“今天不了，霍华德。也许你爸爸今天下午会带你去磨坊。”

她避免朝着街道对面看麦克莱恩家的房子，匆忙赶上霍华德的脚步。




后来，维宁太太偶尔也会在商店或者邮局里碰见麦克莱恩太太，她们也会愉快地交谈。第一周过后，维宁太太再路过农舍时，已经不会对过门不入而感到尴尬，甚至可以再次直视那栋房子了。琼斯先生宽阔的后背经常在灌木丛后面显现，而比利·琼斯或者坐在台阶上，或者和戴维一起躺在草坪上。

一天早晨在下山的路上，维宁太太听见了戴维·麦克莱恩和比利·琼斯之间的一段对话。当时他们正一起在灌木丛里，她听见戴维熟悉的高音问道：“比利，今天你想和我一块儿建一栋房子吗？”

“好的。”比利说道。维宁太太稍微放慢了脚步，想听听他俩在说些什么。

“我们要用树枝建一栋大房子，”戴维兴奋地说道，“当它一完工，我们就问我妈妈我们是否可以在外面吃午饭。”

“你不能只用树枝就想建成一栋房子，”比利说道，“你还得有木头和板子。”

“还得有椅子和桌子，还有餐具，”戴维表示同意，“还要有墙。”

“问问你妈妈我们能搬两把椅子放到这儿吗，”比利说道，“这样我们就可以假装整个花园就是我们的家了。”

“我再给我们拿些小点心一类吃的，”戴维说道，“我们还可以让我妈妈和你爸爸一起来我们的家。”维宁太太沿着旁边的小路走下山时，听见两个孩子欢叫着。

“你不得不承认，”她自言自语地说，虽然她是一个严格而挑剔的人，“你不得不承认他在园子里花了很多心血，现在它是镇上最漂亮的花园了。”而比利行事的态度好像他在这儿拥有和戴维一样多的权利。

当夏天进入漫长而又闷热的日日夜夜，一天和另一天似乎没有什么区别，无法真正准确地辨别出一场小雨到底是昨天下的还是前天下的。维宁一家在晚饭后会挪到院子里闲坐。只有在暖暖的黑暗中，维宁太太有时才能找到机会紧紧挨着她丈夫的身边坐着，抚摸着他的手臂。她从来没教过霍华德要跑到她身边，把头埋在她的膝盖上，或者鼓励他要充分地表达自己的感情，而不是敷衍了事的维宁家式的情感流露。然而，她用这种想法聊以自慰，至少他们是一个完整的家庭，一个稳固的、令人敬重的大家庭。

炎热的天气持续着，维宁太太开始把更多的时间花在商店里，尽量减少在太阳地里走在爬山的路上忍受久久的灼痛的时间。她会停下来和店主聊天，和镇上其他年轻的妈妈们聊天，和她婆婆的老朋友们聊天，谈论天气，谈论镇政府不愿花钱修建一座体面的游泳池，谈论学校在秋天开学之前必须完成的工作，谈论水痘，谈论家长与教师联谊会。一天早上，她在商店里遇见了博尔顿太太，她们聊到了她们的丈夫、热浪、在热天里她们孩子的活动。然后，博尔顿太太说道：“顺便说一下，强尼周六要过六周岁的生日，他要办一个生日派对，霍华德能来吗？”

“太好了，”维宁太太说道，而且开始琢磨，她儿子要穿着白短裤，配着深蓝衬衣，还要带上一个包装精美的礼物。

“大约只有八个孩子参加，”博尔顿太太说道，带着一种可爱的大大咧咧的妈妈用来筹划她们孩子生日派对的口吻，“当然，他们会留下来吃晚饭——把霍华德三点半左右送过来就行。”

“听上去真不错，”维宁太太说道，“我告诉他，他一定会很开心的。”

“我想大部分时间里我都会让他们在室外玩的，”博尔顿太太说道，“在这种天气下。随后或许再让他们玩一些室内的游戏，再接下来就该吃晚饭了。尽量简单些——你知道的。”她犹豫着，用手指在一罐咖啡的顶端边缘处画着圈圈。“你瞧，”她说道，“我希望你不会介意我问一下，如果我没邀请麦克莱恩家的孩子来，你不会有什么想法吧？”

维宁太太觉得好一阵子别扭，不得不等到她的声音变得平稳些了才故作轻松地说道：“如果你觉得无所谓，我当然更无所谓，你干吗要问我？”

博尔顿太太开口笑了起来，“我只是猜想如果他没有来，你可能会介意的。”

维宁太太的脑筋开始转动：不好的事情已经发生了，不管怎样，人们认为他们知道某些关于我的事情，但他们又不想说，他们都假装那也没什么了不起，但是这种事以前从来没在我身上发生过。我毕竟是和维宁一家人生活在一起的，不是吗？“确实，”她说道，把维宁家古屋的凝重都加到了她的声音里，“你凭什么认为它会困扰我呢？”“我把它看得过于严重吗？”她想弄明白，“我看上去太过焦虑吗？我应该根本不用在乎它吗？”

博尔顿太太有些窘迫，她把那罐咖啡放到了架子上，开始故意察看其他架子上的东西了。“我很抱歉，我竟然提到了它。”她说道。

维宁太太觉得她不得不进一步阐明她的态度了，这些话能够代表她最终的观点，至少不能让博尔顿太太这样的饶舌妇有胆子用这样的口吻对维宁家族的某个人说话，还装模作样地用这样的话语开头：“我希望你不会介意我问一下。”“不管怎么说，”维宁太太认真地，把每个字都加重了语气，“她就像比利的继母。”

博尔顿太太转过身，看着维宁太太，以确定她说的是真心话，她做了个鬼脸，说道：“我的上帝呀，海伦！”

维宁太太耸了耸肩膀，然后微笑着，而博尔顿太太也微笑着。接下来，维宁太太说道：“虽说是这样，但我确实对那个小男孩感到非常抱歉。”

博尔顿太太说道：“他也是一个多么可爱的小家伙呀。”

维宁太太刚说了句“他和比利现在整天待在一起”，一抬头，猛地发现麦克莱恩太太在货架中间过道的一头正看着她。搞不清楚她是否已经听见了她们刚才说的话。一时间，维宁太太目光坚定地回看着麦克莱恩太太，然后，用真诚而恰当的腔调说道：“早上好，麦克莱恩太太。今天上午你把小儿子放哪儿啦？”

“早上好，维宁太太。”麦克莱恩太太说道，然后从货架之间的过道走开了。博尔顿太太抓着维宁太太的胳膊，做了一个不顾一切想遮住脸的动作，但是她和维宁太太两个人又忍不住开始放声大笑了起来。

又过了不久，虽然维宁一家院子里的青草在枫树下依然保持着挺拔与翠绿，但是维宁太太每天经过农舍时，开始注意到麦克莱恩太太的花园正在遭受热浪的肆虐。花儿在上午的阳光下打蔫了，不再是花枝招展地挺立了，青草也有些发黄，麦克莱恩太太寄予厚望的一丛丛玫瑰花显而易见也快死了。琼斯先生似乎总是很冷静，稳稳当当地忙他的活计。有时弯着腰，双手在土坷垃里扒拉，有时站直身子，在房子的一侧整理篱笆的格架或者修剪树枝，但是蓝色的窗帘毫无生气地耷拉在窗户边。麦克莱恩太太在商店里仍然对维宁太太点头微笑，接着有一天她们在麦克莱恩太太花园门口碰了个面对面，迟疑了片刻之后，麦克莱恩太太说道：“您能进来待会儿吗？如果您有时间的话，我想跟您谈谈。”

“没问题。”维宁太太彬彬有礼地答道，跟着麦克莱恩太太走上了通往大门的小路。路的两旁仍然布满花丛，但是在某种程度上已失去了光彩，好像夏天的炎热已经把勃勃生气从土壤中灼烤殆尽。在熟悉的起居室里，维宁太太在一张椅子上坐了下来，当麦克莱恩太太像往常一样坐在扶手椅上时，维宁太太显得很有礼貌地正襟危坐着。

“戴维还好吧？”麦克莱恩太太似乎并没有准备好怎么开口，最后维宁太太不得不先问道。

“他很好，”麦克莱恩太太说道，如同每次说起戴维，她都一如既往地面露微笑一样，“他和比利在后院玩呢。”

两个人又沉默了一会儿，然后麦克莱恩太太盯着咖啡桌上的蓝瓷碗说道：“我想问您的是，到底哪儿出了问题？”

维宁太太一直端坐着，对这样的问题自己早有准备，于是她说道：“我不知道您说的是什么意思。”她想：听上去我怎么跟我婆婆老维宁太太的声调如出一辙。但马上又意识到，自己其实喜欢这样，就像她那样的做派。不管维宁太太对自己做着怎样的评价，她还是忍不住又加了一句，“出了什么事了吗？”

“当然。”麦克莱恩太太说道。她还在盯着蓝瓷碗，缓缓地说道：“当我初来乍到时，每个人都那么友善，他们似乎喜欢戴维和我，也想帮助我们。”

“那是不对的，”维宁太太心想，“您不能那样去谈论人们是否喜欢你，如果您那样做，说明品味不高。”

“花园的情况也不错，”麦克莱恩太太无助地说道，“可现在，人们对我们爱答不理的——我过去常常只要隔着篱笆对博尔顿太太问早安，她就会走到篱笆前，我们会谈论起花园；而现在，她只冷冷地说句‘早上好’，扭身就回到了屋里——没人再冲我们微笑了，或者表达诸如此类的善意。”

这是可怕的，维宁太太心想，这是幼稚的，这是人们的抱怨。人们往往会以其人之道，还治其人之身，她一直这么认为。她特别想走过去，握着麦克莱恩太太的手，请求她迷途知返，再次成为好人中的一员。然而，她只是坐在椅子上，把身板挺得更直了，开口说道：“我敢肯定一定是您弄错了。我从来没听有人说起过它。”

“您确定？”麦克莱恩太太扭过脸，看着她，“您确定不是因为琼斯先生在这儿帮工造成的吗？”

维宁太太微微地扬起下巴说道：“这儿的人会因为琼斯而粗暴地对待您，您这么说有什么理由吗？”

麦克莱恩太太和她一起走向门口，她们俩兴致勃勃地计划着下周找时间一起去游泳，一起去野炊。维宁太太向山下走去，边走边想，她本能地会把这一切归咎于对有色人种的歧视。

在夏天快要结束的时候，有一天天气很糟糕，雷雨交加，打破了冗长而闷热的诅咒。刮着大风，小镇上暴风雨整晚倾盆而下，风雨毫不怜惜地扫过树木，把新长出的灌木和鲜花无情地连根拔起。镇上某个区域的一座谷仓受到了风雨的袭击，而另一个区域的电线杆被吹倒了。早晨的时候，维宁太太打开了后门，发现维宁庄园的院子里四处散落着从枫树上刮落的小树枝，而青草全都弯下了腰，几乎都快贴到地面上了。

她婆婆也来到了门前，站在她身后，“多猛烈的暴风雨呀，”她说道，“晚上把你吵醒了吗？”

“我醒了一次，去看了看孩子们，”维宁太太说道，“可能是大约三点钟的时候。”

“我比你醒得晚一些，”她婆婆说道，“我也去看了看孩子们，他们两个睡得很香。”

她俩一起转过身，回到屋里开始准备早餐。

当天稍晚些的时候，维宁太太下山去商店，快到麦克莱恩家房子的时候，她看见麦克莱恩太太和琼斯先生并肩站在花园的前面，比利·琼斯和戴维站在前廊的影子里。他们都在静静地看着。博尔顿家树上的一根巨大的树枝横倒在了花园的中央，把花丛压得枝丫破碎，树枝像钉子一样插进了曾经耀眼夺目的郁金香花坛中。当维宁太太停下观望的时候，博尔顿太太从前门出来四下看了看暴风雨损坏的情况。麦克莱恩太太叫住了她，“早上好，博尔顿太太。好像是你们家的树干树枝刮到了我们家这儿。”

“看上去是这样，”博尔顿太太撂下这句话，转身进了屋，把门砰地关上了。

维宁太太观察着，麦克莱恩太太默默地站了一会儿，然后抬头满是希望地看着琼斯先生，她和琼斯先生彼此对视了很长时间。麦克莱恩太太的声音穿过被暴风雨清洗过的空气，显得格外清越，她说道：“你认为我应该放弃吗，琼斯先生？回到城里，哪怕我再也看不到花园了？”

琼斯先生沮丧地摇了摇头，麦克莱恩太太也耷拉着肩膀，慢慢地走上去，坐到了门前的台阶上。戴维也走过来，坐到了她的身边。琼斯先生生气地拽着大树枝，想把它移走。他摇晃着，使劲地拖拽着树枝，直到肩膀上的肌肉由于用力绷得紧紧的，但是树枝只挪动了一点儿，然后又不动了，好像黏在了花园中。

“别管它了，琼斯先生，”麦克莱恩太太最后开口说道，“让它留在那儿吧，等着下一个住户把它挪走！”

可是琼斯先生仍然想拽动树枝，戴维突然站起身来喊道：“维宁夫人在那儿呢！您好，维宁夫人！”

麦克莱恩太太和琼斯先生都转过身来，麦克莱恩太太挥了挥手，招呼道：“您好！”

维宁太太一言不发地转过身，仪态万方地走在上山的路上，向着古老的维宁庄园走去。





摸彩


六月二十七日的清晨，碧空如洗，阳光灿烂。这一天似乎带着盛夏时节清新的暖意款款而来，朵朵鲜花在怒放，繁茂的青草也绿油油地生长着。大约十点钟光景，村子里的人们开始在邮局和银行之间的广场上聚集起来。在一些城镇，由于人口众多，摸彩要花上两天的时间，所以不得不在六月二十六日就开始了，而这个村子只有三百来号人，整个摸彩活动不会超过两个小时，所以在上午十点钟开始一点儿问题也没有，甚至可以让村民们及时赶回家按时吃上午饭。

当然，孩子们首先聚在了一起，学校刚放暑假，对于大多数孩子来说，一下子获得自由的感觉反而让他们有些坐卧不安。他们在开始打闹之前，往往会先安静地凑成一堆儿，谈论的话题仍然是课堂和老师，还有书本及学校管理人员对他们的训诫。波比·马丁已经在他的口袋里装满了石头，其他的孩子也很快学他的样子，挑选那些最光滑、最圆滚的石头塞满了口袋。波比和哈利·琼斯还有迪克·戴拉克洛莱——村里人会把这个名字发成“戴拉克洛伊”的音——最终在广场的一角把石头堆成了挺大的一堆，并且守护着它，免受其他孩子的打劫。女孩子们站在一边，三五成群地彼此聊着天，不时地扭过头去看这些男孩子，同时也在看那些在尘土中蜂拥而至的孩子，或者那些紧紧拉住大哥哥大姐姐们的手，跌跌撞撞走过来的更小的孩子。

很快，男人们也聚集在了一起，一边瞅着自己的孩子，一边谈论着播种和雨水、拖拉机和税收。他们站在一起，离角落里的那堆石头有点儿远，嘴里小声地说着玩笑话，嘴角露出微笑而非放声大笑。女人们穿着褪了色的家居服和运动毛衫，紧随着她们的男人也来到了广场。当她们来到自己的丈夫身边时，彼此相互打着招呼，交流着一些家长里短。女人们在丈夫身旁站立甫定，便马上召唤自己的孩子，一直喊上四五次，孩子们才不太情愿地过来。波比·马丁的妈妈没有一把抓住他，他便在妈妈的臂弯下笑着跑开，又奔回了石头堆。直到他的父亲大声呵斥他，波比才又老实麻溜地回来，站到了他父亲和大哥中间。

此次摸彩——该活动犹如广场舞、青少年俱乐部项目，或者万圣节的节目——由萨默斯先生主持，这位先生有足够的时间和精力专注于公民活动。他是一位快活的男人，长着一张圆脸，经营着煤炭生意，但人们常常为他感到惋惜，因为他没有子嗣而且老婆还是位悍妇。他到达广场的时候，随身还带着一个黑色的木箱子。这时，从村民中传来一阵窃窃私语声，他挥了挥手，大声喊道：“老乡们，今天有点儿晚了。”邮政局局长格雷乌斯先生跟在萨默斯先生的身后，他拿着一个三脚板凳，并把板凳放在了广场的中心位置，而萨默斯先生则把黑木箱子放在了凳子上面。村民们和凳子保持着距离，在他们和凳子之间留出了一片空场。这时，萨默斯先生说道：“有人愿意给我搭把手吗？”人们一开始有些迟疑，马丁先生和他的大儿子巴克斯特先犹豫了一下，然后走上前来，用手把住凳子上的箱子，而萨默斯先生开始搅动箱子里的纸片。

最初用于摸彩的装备在很多年以前就丢失了，现在放在板凳上的黑箱子，在镇子上最年长的华纳老汉出生之前就已经开始使用了。萨默斯先生不止一次地对村民们说要做一个新箱子，但没人愿意费事，以至于现在的这个黑箱子被赋予了很多传统。有种说法，现在的这个箱子是由老箱子的残片制成的，而原来的箱子是由第一个定居在这儿的村民打造的。每一年，在摸完彩之后，萨默斯先生又会重提做一个新箱子的事，但是每年最后都会不了了之，一切照旧。于是，这个箱子一年比一年破烂不堪，现在它已经不再是全黑的了，一侧已经斑驳破裂，露出了原木的颜色，有的部分已经褪色或者被染成了其他颜色。

马丁先生和他的大儿子巴克斯特稳稳地把扶着凳子上的黑箱子，直到萨默斯先生用手把纸片彻底搅拌均匀为止。因为仪式中的很多细节已经被忘记或者被废弃，所以萨默斯先生成功地用纸片代替了用了好几代的木片。萨默斯先生认为，当一个村子很小的时候，用木片是丝毫没有问题的，可现在村子里的人口已经超过三百了，而且很有可能继续增加，那就有必要采用某种更适合的东西，能把它轻易地投入黑箱子里。在摸彩的头一天晚上，萨默斯先生和格雷乌斯先生就把纸片做好，把它们放到了箱子中，然后把箱子搬到萨默斯先生煤炭公司的保险柜中锁好，直到第二天早上萨默斯先生作好把它带到广场上的准备。一年中的其他时光，箱子都会被撂到一边，有时搁在某处，有时又放在另一个地方。它会在格雷乌斯先生的谷仓里挨过一年，另外一年又会在邮局落脚，有时它也会被放在马丁杂货店的架子上，摆在那里而没人理睬。

在萨默斯先生宣布摸彩开始之前，还有很多杂七杂八的事情要处理。要列出一些名单——家族族长的名字、每个家族各个户主的名字、每个家庭各个成员的名字。邮政局局长要主持萨默斯先生宣誓就任摸彩主持人的仪式，萨默斯先生要像模像样地宣誓就职。有人还会想起曾经一度还有某种仪式，也是由摸彩官员所实施的，他要领诵一阵敷衍了事的朗诵会。那是些没腔没调的话语，而这些话语他每年都要口若悬河地一口气按时说一遍。有些人还认为，在摸彩官员讲话或者诵读时，他只需站立在那儿就行了；而有的人则认为，他应该在人群中四处走动。但是在很多年前，仪式的这个部分被获许取消了。另外，还有一种致敬的仪式，摸彩官员要向每个上前从箱子中摸彩的人致辞，但是随着时间的推移，这个环节也省略掉了。直到现在，人们才觉得摸彩官员对每个向他走来的人说上一两句话还是很有必要的。而萨默斯先生对这一切程序都熟稔于心，他穿着干净的白衬衣和蓝色的牛仔裤，一只手漫不经心地搭在黑箱子上，当他没完没了地跟格雷乌斯先生和马丁一家谈话时，他显得煞是庄重。

就在萨默斯先生终于谈完了话，转身面向聚集的村民时，哈钦逊太太沿着小路匆匆忙忙地来到了广场，她的毛衫披在肩上，赶到人群后面时毛衫滑落到了地上。“我彻彻底底地把今儿这个日子给忘了。”她冲着紧挨着她的戴拉克洛莱太太说道，她俩都轻声笑了起来。“我还以为我们家那位出去摞木材去了，”哈钦逊太太继续说道，“等我再向窗外瞟了几眼，发现孩子们也不见了，我才想起来今天是二十七号了，就一溜小跑过来了。”她在围裙上擦干了手，戴拉克洛莱太太说道：“不过你来得正好，他们还在那儿没完没了地说呢。”

哈钦逊太太伸长脖子透过人群向里面张望，看见自己的丈夫和孩子们正站在接近最前排的地方。她轻拍了一下戴拉克洛莱太太的手臂，示意有空再聊，然后开始向人群中挤去。人们善意地侧过身子给她闪开一条道让她过去。有两三个人用正好能让整个人群都听到的声音说道：“哈钦逊，你老婆来啦。”还有“比尔，她终于到了。”哈钦逊太太挤到了她丈夫身边，而萨默斯先生一直在等着她，他此时高兴地说道：“苔茜，我原以为我们会在没有你的情况下，继续下面的活动呢。”哈钦逊太太露齿一笑，说道：“你不会让我把碟子、碗什么的扔在水槽里不管吧，喏，是吧，乔？”人群中传来一阵轻笑。哈钦逊太太到了以后，人们又挤挤擦擦推推搡搡地各就其位了。

“好了，请大家安静，”萨默斯先生严肃地说道，“我想我们最好现在就开始吧，等把这事做完，大家就可以该干吗干吗了，还有谁没来吗？”

“邓巴没来，”有几个人说道，“还有邓巴，邓巴。”

萨默斯先生查看了一下手中的名单。“克莱德·邓巴，”他说道，“没错，他摔断了腿，对吧？谁能替他抽呢？”

“我来替他抽，我想我可以。”一个女人应声答道，萨默斯先生转身看着她。“邓巴的老婆替她丈夫抽，”萨默斯先生又接着说，“你们家没有一个成年的男孩替你做这事吗，詹妮？”虽然萨默斯先生和村里的其他人都很清楚地知道这个问题的答案，但问这样的问题是摸彩官员例行公事的正式程序。所以，在邓巴太太回答之前，萨默斯先生出于礼貌，煞有介事地等待着这个已知的答案。

“霍瑞斯还不到十六岁，”邓巴太太遗憾地说道，“我想今年我得自己替一下我家老头子了。”

“好的，”萨默斯先生说道，他在手中的名单上做了一个标注。然后又问道，“沃特森家的小子今年还抽吗？”

人群中一个高个子男孩举起了手，“在这儿，”他说道，“我替我妈和我自己抽。”人群中传来一些声音，有人说：“好小子，杰克。”还有人说：“很高兴看见你母亲找到男人为她做这件事了。”他听了紧张地眨巴着眼睛，低下了头。

“好了，”萨默斯先生说道，“我想每个人都到了，华纳老汉也到了吗？”

“我在这儿。”人群中传来一个声音，萨默斯先生点了点头。




萨默斯先生看着名单，清了清嗓子，“大家都准备好了吗？”他喊道。这时人群突然安静了下来。“现在，我会叫各位的名字——首先是族长——叫到名字的人到跟前来，从箱子中抽取一张纸，把纸片拿在手中，不要打开，不要看，直到每个人都抽取了纸片，大家都清楚了吗？”

人们对这一套程序早已司空见惯，所以他们并没有全神贯注地听指令，但大多数人还是大气不敢出，舔了舔嘴唇，不再左顾右盼。这时，萨默斯先生高高地举起了一只手，叫道：“亚当斯。”一个男人拨开人群，走上前来。“你好，史蒂夫。”萨默斯先生招呼道，亚当斯先生也回复道：“你好，乔。”他们彼此勉强一本正经却又不安地咧嘴笑了笑。然后，亚当斯先生来到黑箱子跟前，从里面抽出了一张折好的纸片。他紧紧地攥着纸片的一角，转过身匆忙地回到了人群中他原来站的位置。这地方和他的家人还有一段距离。他并没有低头瞧一眼手上的东西。

“艾伦，”萨默斯先生叫道，“安蒂森……本萨姆。”

“好像距离上次摸彩压根就没隔多长时间似的，”戴拉克洛莱太太对着后排的格雷乌斯太太说道。“就好像最近的一次在上周我们才弄完。”

“时间确实过得飞快。”格雷乌斯太太说道。

“克拉克……戴拉克洛莱。”

“轮到我们家老头子了。”戴拉克洛莱太太说。当她丈夫走上前时，她屏住了呼吸。

“邓巴。”萨默斯先生叫道，邓巴太太从容地走到了箱子前，而有一个妇女还在催促，“快去呀，詹妮。”另一个妇女接茬道：“她不是过去了吗。”

“下一个该我们了。”格雷乌斯太太说道。格雷乌斯先生在她的注视下从箱子一侧绕过来，很严肃地跟萨默斯先生打了个招呼，然后从箱子里挑了一张折好的纸片。到目前为止，人群中很多男人在他们的大手中都握着一张折好的小纸片，所有的人正神经质般提心吊胆地把纸片翻过来掉过去。邓巴太太和两个儿子站在一起，她的手里也正攥着纸片。

“哈伯特……哈钦逊。”

“赶紧过去，比尔。”哈钦逊太太催道，她附近的人都笑了起来。

“琼斯。”

“他们确实在说，”亚当斯先生对站在他身边的华纳老汉说道，“北边的村子那里正在讨论放弃摸彩活动。”

华纳老汉嗤之以鼻地哼了一下，“一群头脑发热的傻瓜，”他说道，“听这些年轻人的就没什么好事。接下来你就知道，他们还想回到山洞里生活呢，人们都不再劳作，那样的生活也就能过一阵子。过去有种说法，‘六月里摸彩，玉米熟得快。’否则的话，你首先要知道，我们只能吃炖鸡草和橡子了。摸彩祖祖辈辈都在做。”他还怒气冲冲地补充道，“看着年轻的乔·萨默斯杵在那儿跟每个人开玩笑就够糟的了。”

“一些地方已经废除了摸彩活动。”亚当斯太太说道。

“要是那样，除了麻烦，什么也不会得到，”华纳老汉不容置疑地说道，“一群年少无知的生瓜蛋子。”

“马丁。”波比·马丁注视着他父亲走上前去。“奥威尔戴克……珀西。”

“我希望他们能快点儿，”邓巴太太对她的大儿子说道，“我希望他们能快点儿。”

“他们就快抽完了。”她的儿子说道。

“你准备好跑着去告诉你爹结果吧。”邓巴太太说道。

萨默斯先生叫了自己的名字，然后一本正经地走上前，从箱子中抽出了一张纸片。随后，他又喊道：“华纳。”

“今年是我参加摸彩的第七十七个年头了。”华纳老汉一边穿过人群，一边嘟囔道，“这是第七十七次了。”

“沃特森。”那个高个头的男孩穿过人群，有点儿手足无措地来到了箱子前。这时听见人群中有人在喊：“别紧张，杰克。”萨默斯先生也安慰道：“别慌，孩子。”

“扎尼尼。”




此后，是很长时间的一段停顿，一种令人窒息的停顿，直到萨默斯先生拿着他的纸片，高高举在空中，只听他说道：“好了，伙计们。”有那么一小会儿，没人走动，随后所有的纸片都被打开了。突然，女人们纷纷张嘴，急切地问道，“是谁？”“谁抽到了？”“是邓巴家吗？”“是沃特森家吗？”过了一会儿，又在七嘴八舌，接着有个声音说，“是哈钦逊，是比尔。”“比尔·哈钦逊抽到了它。”

“快去告诉你父亲。”邓巴太太对她的大儿子吩咐道。

人们开始四下张望，想观察一下哈钦逊一家人的反应。比尔·哈钦逊一声不响地站着，眼睛直勾勾地盯着手上的纸片。突然，苔茜·哈钦逊冲着萨默斯先生大声嚷道：“你没给他足够的时间让他抽取自己想要的纸片，我看见你这样做了，这不公平！”

“别耍赖，苔茜。”戴拉克洛莱太太喊道，格雷乌斯太太也附和道：“我们所有人的机会都是均等的。”

“闭嘴，苔茜。”比尔·哈钦逊说道。

“好吧，大家听好了，”萨默斯先生说道，“刚才我们做得挺利索了，现在我们还要更利索些，好让我们能够及时做完这事。”他说完又看了看下一张单子。“比尔，”他说道，“你为哈钦逊家族摸彩，哈钦逊家族还有别的家庭吗？”

“还有唐和爱娃，”哈钦逊太太大声喊叫道，“让她们也来试试运气！”

“女儿们是和她们的婆家一起摸彩的，苔茜，”萨默斯先生柔声说道，“这一点你和大伙儿都很清楚。”

“这不公平。”苔茜还是执拗地说。

“我不这样想，乔，”比尔·哈钦逊抱歉地说道，“我女儿和她们婆家一块儿摸彩，这很公平，我除了几个未成年的孩子，家里没有别的人了。”

“那么，就整个家族来看，是你来摸彩，”萨默斯先生解释道，“就整个家庭来说，也是你来摸彩，对吧？”

“对的。”比尔·哈钦逊说道。

“比尔，你有几个年幼的孩子？”萨默斯先生一本正经地问道。

“三个。”比尔·哈钦逊说道。

“就是小比尔、南希和小戴夫，还有苔茜和我自己。”

“那么，好吧，”萨默斯先生说道，“哈利，你把他们的票都收回来了吗？”

格雷乌斯先生点了点头，举起了手中的好几张纸片。“那么把它们放到箱子里吧，”萨默斯先生示意道，“拿上比尔的签，把它也投进去。”

“我觉得我们应该重新来一遍，”哈钦逊太太尽量心平气和地说道，“我告诉过你这不公平，你没有给他足够的时间来选择，大家都看到了。”

格雷乌斯先生已经选择了五张纸片，把它们又投入了箱子，他把其他人的纸片都扔到了地上，这时微风乍起，又把它们从地上吹了起来。

“大家都听我说。”哈钦逊太太正冲着她周边的人唠叨着说。

“准备好了吗，比尔？”萨默斯先生问道。而比尔·哈钦逊快速地环视了一下他的妻子和孩子们，点了点头。

“记住了，”萨默斯先生说，“抽取一张纸片，先不要打开，直到五个人都抽完。哈利，你帮一下小戴夫。”格雷乌斯先生拉着那个小男孩的一只手，小戴夫屁颠屁颠地跟着他来到箱子前。“从箱子里抽出一张纸，戴维。”萨默斯先生说道。戴维把他的小手伸进了箱子，咧开嘴呵呵地笑出了声。“只能拿一张啊。”萨默斯先生赶紧嘱咐道。“哈利，你替他拿着吧。”格雷乌斯先生举着孩子的小手，把折叠的纸片从孩子紧攥的拳头中拿了出来，自己拿着。而小戴维站在他身旁，好奇地抬眼望着他。

“下一个南希，南希下一个。”萨默斯先生接着说。南希十二岁了，她晃动着裙摆走上前去，姿势优雅地从箱子中抽出了一张纸。与此同时，她的同学们的呼吸都变得急促了起来。“小比尔，”萨默斯又叫道。当脸蛋红扑扑的，长着一双大脚的比利从箱子里抽出纸片时，差点儿打翻了箱子。“苔茜。”萨默斯先生叫道。她犹豫了一小会儿，挑战似的四下看了看，然后紧抿着嘴唇，走到了箱子前。她迅速地抽出了一张纸，背过手拿着它。

“比尔。”萨默斯先生点了最后一个名字，比尔·哈钦逊走到箱子前面，伸手在箱子里摸了一圈，最后拿出了一张纸片。

人群安静了下来。一个女孩小声说道：“我希望不是南希。”这个轻声低语竟然传到了人群的外围。

“过去可不是这么干的，”华纳老汉明确地说道，“人们都不按原来的套路出牌了。”

“好了，”萨默斯先生说道，“把纸片打开吧。哈利，你替小戴夫把纸片打开。”

格雷乌斯先生把纸片打开了，当他把纸片高高举起时，每个人都能看见纸是空白的，人群中的大部分人发出一阵叹息声。南希和小比尔也同时打开了他们手中的纸片，两个人都面露喜色，开口笑了起来，转身面向人群，把纸片高高举过头顶。

“苔茜。”萨默斯先生说道。这时时间好像停顿了下来，萨默斯先生看着比尔·哈钦逊，比尔打开了他的纸片，把纸片展示给大家看，也是空白的。

“那就是苔茜了，”萨默斯先生说道，他的声音很小，“比尔，让我们看看她的纸片吧。”

比尔·哈钦逊走向他的妻子，把纸片从她手里夺了下来。上面有一个黑点，这个黑点是萨默斯先生头天晚上在他煤炭公司的办公室里用很粗的铅笔画下来的。比尔·哈钦逊把它举了起来，人群中出现了一阵骚动。

“好了，老乡们，”萨默斯先生说道，“让我们赶快结束吧。”

虽然村民们已经忘记了这个仪式中的很多程序，也记不清黑箱子最初的模样了，但他们仍然记得要用石头。男孩子们早些时候堆起的石头已经准备好了，地上也有的是石头，石头边满是箱子里取出来的被风吹得乱飞的纸片。戴拉克洛莱挑了一块大石头，她不得不用双手抱着，扭脸冲着邓巴太太说道，“来吧，”她说，“快点儿。”

邓巴太太双手拿了一些小石块，她气喘吁吁地说：“我根本跑不动，你先去，我随后会赶上你的。”

孩子们也已经拿好了石块，还有人给了小戴维·哈钦逊几块鹅卵石。

此时，苔茜·哈钦逊身处被清空的广场中心，当村民们步步逼近时，她绝望地伸出了双手。“这不公平。”她喊道。一块石头打在了她脑袋的一侧。华纳老汉招呼着众人，“大家都来，都来。”史蒂夫·亚当斯在村民队伍的前面，他的旁边是格雷乌斯太太。

“这不公平，这不应该。”哈钦逊太太惊恐地尖叫着。就在这时，他们扑向了她。





岛


蒙塔古夫人的儿子对老太太很孝顺，把她照顾得无微不至，时不时地嘘寒问暖。这样的儿子现在很难得了，因为他们得应付忙碌的妻子，以及自己小家庭不断的添丁进口。当蒙塔古夫人老糊涂的时候，儿子就自然而然地承担起了看护人的角色。虽然他们现在住的地方几乎相距一千英里，但蒙塔古夫人和儿子有着很浓、很深的感情。亨利·保罗·蒙塔古对自己的母亲能否得到很好的照料颇为关注，他要时时刻刻落实母亲所住公寓每月的账单付清了没有，她的衣食住行如何，陪伴她的人怎样，总之要确保蒙塔古夫人得到最好的照料。他每周都要给她写信，信中充满关切，笔迹工整，询问她的身体情况。每次他来纽约，都会第一时间来看她，而且总是会留下额外的支票给照顾她的人，确保蒙塔古夫人所缺的，哪怕是任何微不足道的东西也要给她置办齐全。照顾蒙塔古夫人的奥克斯小姐已经陪伴老太太有六年了，这些年一成不变、平静如水的生活节奏只被蒙塔古夫人儿子定期的来访打破过。而奥克斯小姐每年有六周的休假时间，临时替代她的人会经过千挑万选，以保证对蒙塔古夫人的照料丝毫不会打折扣。

除了这些偶尔会被打乱的情况，蒙塔古夫人一直安静地住在一间相当不错的公寓里，这间公寓的租金价格不菲，在这里老太太和奥克斯小姐过着有规律的安稳生活，这种生活要求奥克斯小姐尽心尽力地去做安排，并尽职尽责地按时向蒙塔古夫人的儿子做汇报。“我的的确确认为我们很幸运了，亲爱的，”奥克斯小姐经常发着议论，“您有一个像蒙塔古先生这样的好儿子，把我们关照得这么好。”

对此，蒙塔古夫人照例答道：“亨利·保罗是个好孩子。”

蒙塔古夫人上午通常会在床上度过，吃午饭时才起来。在经过洗澡、穿衣、吃饭一番折腾之后，她会再回到床上躺着。然后几乎是雷打不动地在四点钟的时候去散步。再接下来就是晚饭时间了，饭菜是在楼下餐馆订的。晚饭后不久，就又到了蒙塔古夫人上床的时间了。虽然奥克斯小姐除非迫不得已不会离开房间，但她也有很多时间忙活自己的事情。蒙塔古夫人谈不上是最好的看护对象，可奥克斯小姐工作起来还是不紧不慢，得心应手。奥克斯小姐从浏览的杂志上抬起头来，经常会发现蒙塔古夫人正好奇地观察着她。有时，蒙塔古夫人会像小孩子那样使性子，固执己见，无论怎么劝说，就是拒绝吃饭。奥克斯小姐不得不把蒙塔古夫人的医生请来，让老太太好好听一听医生的一番义正词严的说教，让她明白作为病人应该怎样去做。有一次，蒙塔古夫人想逃跑，在路口正茫然四顾时，让奥克斯小姐在公寓楼前的大街上逮了个正着。老太太总是没完没了地送给奥克斯小姐东西，而且态度绝对很坦诚，这让奥克斯得煞费周章地拒绝她。

奥克斯小姐出身贫寒，蒙塔古夫人心知肚明。奥克斯小姐以前很辛苦地工作，可从未拥有过自己的皮毛外套。无论奥克斯小姐如何煞费苦心，她依然无法掩饰这样的事实，尽管楼下餐馆送来的饭菜加工得色香味俱全，可她还是要往里面加些作料。人们都说奥克斯小姐对珠宝一类的东西不屑一顾，在百货商店买衣服时，她往往在一位不耐烦的、着装很差劲的销售小姐的注视下，匆匆忙忙地买上一件便宜的衣服。无论奥克斯小姐如何懊恼地辩解，那些在廉价服装店讨巧的灯光下看上去还不错的衣服，等她买回去，在日光下都证明了是那么俗气。要么是难看的红和黄色，要么条纹不直、圆点不整，裁剪得也很糟糕。奥克斯小姐有时可怜巴巴地想，还是那些整齐地挂在衣橱中的白制服，穿起来不至于露怯，但是蒙塔古夫人对于能够暴露出奥克斯小姐职业痕迹的任何装束都大为不满，所以，每天晚上奥克斯小姐都会身穿红黄相间的裙子，享用从楼下餐馆送来的可口饭菜。她未加染色的头发很散乱地在脑后扎了个髻，没有戴戒指的双手在盘子之间惬意地移动。蒙塔古夫人通常会把吃的弄得满身全是，但是每隔三四个月，她都会从附近的服装专卖店中刻意订制一些衣服，而有关衣服的尺寸和颜色等信息，已经提前告诉店家了。柔声细语的销售小姐把完全合身的衣服给蒙塔古夫人送上门即可。蒙塔古夫人一般每次会挑上两件衣服，于是衣服被整齐地挂在了有香囊的挂钩上，和其他类似的衣服一起，安稳地住进了蒙塔古夫人的衣柜中，所有的衣服都是浅蓝、浅灰和淡紫色的。

“我们必须对漂亮衣服多加爱护。”奥克斯小姐说道。她从晚餐中抬起头，发现蒙塔古夫人，有时似乎是故意地把一满勺的燕麦粥扣在了衣服前襟上。“亲爱的，我们真的得多加小心了，想想您的好儿子为这些衣服花了多少钱呐。”

蒙塔古夫人手里拿着勺子，有时茫然地瞪大眼睛，有时会说：“我现在想吃布丁了，我会对我的布丁多加小心的。”时不时地，蒙塔古夫人通常在某一天身体难受，或者是累过头了，或者是因为某件事不高兴了的时候，她会把一碗的燕麦粥倒扣在桌布上。奥克斯小姐往往也会生气，于是蒙塔古夫人便被剥夺了享用布丁的权利，呆坐在那里。而奥克斯小姐便把她自己的碟子和碗挪到咖啡桌上，叫侍者把沾满燕麦粥的桌布撤走。

晚春时节，通常是蒙塔古夫人的状况最糟糕的时候。那时，由于某种原因，似乎是万物萌生，甚至肮脏的城市交通都传递着某种骚动和渴望的气息，以至于她能间歇性地感受到一年之中剩下的日子会怎样。大约在四月份或者五月份的时候，奥克斯小姐就要开始准备应对麻烦了，她得提防老太太自己跑出门，或者把燕麦粥完全打翻。在夏天，蒙塔古夫人似乎开心多了，因为她有可能去公园里散步，喂小松鼠了。在秋天，她变得安静了，为漫长的冬天做着准备。在冬天她就像动物一样，几乎要冬眠了。她很少说话，忍受着别人给她穿衣、脱衣的摆布，丝毫没有反抗。而恰恰冬天是奥克斯小姐最放松的时候，虽然过不了几个月就该到春天了，奥克斯小姐开始更多地考虑要放弃她的工作、可观的薪水，还有从楼下餐馆送来的可口饭菜了。

也就是在这年春天，蒙塔古夫人频繁地想送给奥克斯小姐东西。一天下午，因为下雨，她们例常的散步只能暂时放弃。蒙塔古夫人习惯性地走到厅里的衣柜前，拿出了她的外套。现在她坐在扶手椅上，那件深黑色的貂皮外套搭在她的膝头，她用手摩挲着皮毛，好像怀抱着一只猫，“漂亮，”蒙塔古夫人不停地嘟囔道，“漂亮，漂亮。”

“我们很幸运能有这些可爱的衣服。”奥克斯小姐说道。因为让自己总是保持在忙碌之中是她的一种修行方式，只要多才多艺的双手能做有用的事情，她就绝不让它们闲着。此刻，她正在织一个围脖，其实已经快织完了，但奥克斯小姐开始感到绝望。毛线的颜色，在商店里，或者还是线团的时候，似乎是柔和的嫩绿色，可织成围脖后，就变成了俗气的黄绿色，使得它当初的目的——围在亨利·保罗·蒙塔古圆滚结实的脖子上——看上去有那么一点儿不合适。奥克斯小姐用一种客观的眼光审视着它，越看越懊恼，如同她所创造的每一件东西都会让她懊恼不已一样。

“你得考虑一下花销了，”奥克斯小姐说道，“这些漂亮的东西都得花钱呀，只是因为你儿子是那么的大方和好心。”

“我把这个皮衣送你吧，”蒙塔古太太冷不丁地说道，“因为你自己没有漂亮的东西。”

“谢谢你了，亲爱的。”奥克斯小姐说道。她忙了一会儿手里的围脖，然后接着说：“亲爱的，把那么好的东西送人多可惜呀。”

“你穿上可能不合适，”蒙塔古太太说道，“它看上去太糟糕了，你穿上不是很漂亮。”

奥克斯小姐沉默了一会儿，然后又开口说：“好了，亲爱的，我们来看看还下不下雨，好吗？”她如释重负地放下了手里的针织活儿，走到了窗前。她小心翼翼地把细纱窗帘和厚厚的深红色帷帘拉开了，准确地说，这窗帘和帷帘并不是她自己要装的，但是它们对她很有帮助，而且摸上去手感不错，应该价格不菲。“差不多停了。”她高兴地说道。她眯缝着眼睛向上看了看天空。“我确信天快晴了，”她继续说道，好像她灿烂的笑容可以创造出一个光芒四射的太阳，“也就大概十五分钟以后……”她让她的声音变得越来越轻，满怀期待地对蒙塔古太太微笑着。

“我不想出去散步了，”蒙塔古太太闷闷不乐地说道，“我们小的时候，常常脱掉所有的衣服，跑到雨中撒欢。”

奥克斯小姐重新回到椅子上，拿起了她的针织活。“我们过几分钟就可以准备出门了。”她信誓旦旦地说道。

“我现在不想出门，我肯定，”蒙塔古太太说道，“我想给图画上颜色。”

她从椅子上慢慢站起来，把貂皮外套掉在地板上摊成一堆，一步一步颤颤巍巍地穿过房间走到牌桌前，桌上放着填图画本和蜡笔盒。奥克斯小姐叹了口气，放下了她手里的针织活，走过去捡起了貂皮外套，把它轻轻地搭在了椅子背上，然后又走了回去，再次拿起了正在织的围脖。

“漂亮，漂亮，”蒙塔古太太边涂边轻声唱道，“漂亮的蓝色，漂亮的清水，漂亮，漂亮。”

奥克斯小姐看着手中的围脖，脸上浮现出一丝微笑。围脖的颜色很亮丽，对于一个已不再年轻的男人来说，这颜色也许有点儿太艳了，但是还算赏心悦目，并不是真正绿得不正。他的生日还有三周就要到了，盒子中的卡片上会写上“您忠实的朋友和崇拜者，波莉·奥克斯”。奥克斯小姐轻轻叹了口气。

“我想去散步了。”蒙塔古太太出其不意地说道。

“就等一小会儿，亲爱的。”奥克斯小姐说道。她再次把手里的活放下，对蒙塔古太太微笑着，“我来帮你。”奥克斯小姐一边说着，一边走过去帮蒙塔古太太从直背椅上站起来，老太太起身总是磕磕绊绊很费劲。“干吗这样呀，瞧瞧你的模样。”奥克斯小姐看着图画书顶在头上的蒙塔古太太说道。她大声笑了起来。“你把所有的空白都涂成了蓝色，你这个傻孩子。”她翻了一页，“还有这儿，”她边说，边又哈哈大笑起来。“为什么这个男人长着一张蓝色的脸呀？还有这张图画里的小女孩——她不可能是蓝色的呀，亲爱的，她的脸应该是粉色的，她的头发应该是——呃，比如说，黄色的，而不是蓝色的。”

蒙塔古太太把她的双手狂乱地蒙在图画上，“这是我的，”她喊道，“走开，这是我的。”

“我很抱歉，”奥克斯小姐安慰道，“我并不是在嘲笑你，亲爱的。只是我看到一个男人长着一张蓝色的脸觉得很好笑。”她扶着蒙塔古太太从椅子上站起身，又陪她穿过房间来到貂皮外套旁。蒙塔古太太僵直地站着，任由奥克斯小姐把外套披在她肩上，帮她把胳膊伸进袖子。当奥克斯小姐转到她的面前，把脖领前的扣子扣上时，蒙塔古太太撇着嘴角，凑近奥克斯小姐的脸生气地说：“你不懂事情的本来面目，真的。”

“也许我不懂。”奥克斯小姐心不在焉地说道。她上下打量了一番蒙塔古太太，貂皮外套的扣子都整整齐齐地扣上了，然后她又把蒙塔古太太以玫瑰花做装饰的帽子从厅里柜子抽屉里拿了出来，戴在了老太太的头上，并认真地正了正帽子的角度，让玫瑰花的位置正好凸显。“现在我们看上去是那么的漂亮。”奥克斯小姐满意地说道。蒙塔古太太安静地站着，奥克斯小姐走到厅里的衣柜前，拿出了她自己结实耐用的蓝外套。她穿上了外套，用衣领处一条轻便的拉绳把衣领整理了一下，把帽子戴在头上，旋即把帽子前后调了个个儿，让帽檐准确地落在眼睛上方的位置上。直到她陪着蒙塔古太太走到门口，奥克斯小姐才对着门厅的镜子匆匆忙忙地瞥了一眼，就像一个人这样做是出于神经的冲动，而不是真正想去了解事情原委的欲望。

奥克斯小姐喜欢门厅到门口的这条通道，地板上铺的地毯很厚，即使笨重的鞋子走在上面也不会发出声响。电梯无人值守，是自助的，奥克斯小姐用她超人般的控制力，让电梯悄无声息地滑向大堂。电梯载着奥克斯小姐自己，还有蒙塔古太太，后者温顺地坐在用天鹅绒做垫子的小凳上，眼睛死死地盯着电梯控制面板，好像以前从未见过似的。电梯的门打开了，她们走进了大堂，奥克斯小姐知道，很少有人注意到她们——电话总机的接线员姑娘、门房，另外一个房客正走向电梯——他们认出了蒙塔古太太，这位有钱的老太太住在高层，而奥克斯小姐绝对是个能干的陪护，如果没有她尽职尽责的帮助，蒙塔古太太十分钟都活不下去。奥克斯小姐步伐坚定有力地走过大堂，她的手镇定地推着轮椅，引导着柔软、弱小的蒙塔古太太。大堂的地面铺着浅色的地毯，走在上面听不到一点儿脚步声。大堂的墙壁涂着一种昂贵的颜料，是原色的，几乎看不出任何别的颜色。奥克斯小姐和蒙塔古太太一起穿过大堂，好像她们正走在云端，漫步在无限空间中的混沌区域。大门是她们的目标，而身着灰色制服的门房，用一种夸张的手势给她们俩开路，而且招呼着“下午好”，刚开始是冲着蒙塔古太太的，因为她是雇主；而后才对着奥克斯小姐打着招呼，因为从她那里才有可能得到回应。

“下午好，乔治。”奥克斯小姐带着优雅而庄重的微笑，一边说着，一边推着蒙塔古太太走向了大门。一旦到了门外的人行道上，奥克斯小姐就得掌控好轮椅的方向，并且很快地靠到左边，因为如果任由老太太掌握方向，她可能很容易出人意料地把轮椅行驶到右边，虽然她们通常都是靠左边走，但蒙塔古太太的行动往往会把奥克斯小姐当天的散步安排搅得乱七八糟。她们走得虽然很慢，但最终融入了街上熙熙攘攘的人流当中，奥克斯小姐注视着前方，防止蒙塔古太太在陌生人中走失，蒙塔古太太抬起脸，望着灰色的天空。

“天真好，”奥克斯小姐说道，“雨后很凉爽。”

她们走了大约半个街区后，蒙塔古太太轻轻地按了按奥克斯小姐的胳膊，示意她们走人行道的内侧以便能更靠近商店的橱窗。奥克斯小姐起初没有理会，最后拗不过她，心有不甘地来到人行道的内侧，站到了一家文具店橱窗的前面。

她们每天都会在这个地方停下来，而且每天她都会重复同样的话。蒙塔古太太喃喃自语，“瞅瞅这些东西，多可爱呀。”她兴致勃勃地看着一只塑料制成的小鸟，鸟儿是亮丽的红黄两色，正一下一下地把鸟喙探到一个玻璃杯中喝水。她们站在那儿看着鸟儿慢慢低下头，把嘴接触到水面上，犹豫了一下，然后又抬起了头。

“我们不在这儿时，它会停下来吗？”蒙塔古太太问道。奥克斯小姐笑着说：“它永远不会停下的，甚至我们吃饭和睡觉时，它都会一直这样做下去。”

蒙塔古太太还很留意一个日记本，空白的页面上标着日期：6月14日—6月15日。蒙塔古太太盯着光滑、没有任何字迹的空白页屏住了呼吸。“我想要那个日记本。”她说道。而奥克斯小姐，重复着每天千篇一律的回答，“你要在上面写什么呀，亲爱的？”

另外一件总是吸引蒙塔古太太的东西是一个曲线柔和的蓝碗，摆放在橱窗展示的中心位置。蒙塔古太太每天都会呆呆地凝视着它，还试图透过窗户上的玻璃去触摸它。

“行了，亲爱的，”奥克斯小姐几乎不耐烦地拽着蒙塔古太太的胳膊，最后忍不住说道，“如果你还不挪窝的话，我们可散不完步了。”

蒙塔古太太乖乖地跟在了后面，“漂亮，”她小声嘀咕，“漂亮，漂亮。”




她突然睁开了眼睛，意识到自己在看着什么。天空不可思议的蓝，万里无云，脚下的沙滩晒得很烫。她能看见海水，颜色比天空还要深，但是显得稍微绿一些。在遥远的海面上，天空和海水交会成了一线，极其纯净。

“漂亮。”她嘟囔道，意识到自己在自言自语。她正走在沙滩上，突然停下了脚步，很不耐烦地把鞋子甩了出去，先是一只脚站立，然后又是另一只脚。她不禁低头看了一下自己的双脚。她的个头很高，要是穿着鞋站在沙滩上就更高了，她把鞋脱了以后，活动得轻松自如了，但是沉重的外套和帽子却是很碍事的累赘，尤其是帽子，戴在她头上有着明显的重量，这也是一种压迫。于是，她把帽子扔到了滚烫而可爱的沙滩上，帽子看上去令人反感，很明显的装饰用的玫瑰映衬着沙子的光滑和晶莹，她迅速地弯下腰，抓了好几把沙子把帽子埋了起来。而把脱下的衣服用沙子埋起来要费事得多，沙子在貂皮大衣短短的黑色毛绒间优美地滑落。在大衣还没埋到一半的时候，她决定把剩下的衣服也跟它一起埋起来，说干就干，她轻松地挣脱了很多衣服的袢、扣、带子的束缚，这些衣服在她的记忆中是挺难穿上身的。当把所有的衣服都埋在沙子里面之后，她心满意足地低头看着自己健壮的、白白的双腿，心想，同时也意识到自己正在琢磨：这双腿几乎和沙子有着相同的颜色。她开始自由地奔跑，她的右边是蔚蓝的海洋和更加湛蓝的天空，她的左边是树林，而她脚下是移动的沙砾。她跑着，跑着，直到回到了起跑的地方，埋在沙子中的大衣的一角还露在外面。她看见它，停了下来，喃喃地说道：“漂亮，漂亮。”然后蹲了下去，捧起一把沙子，让它们从指间滑落。

在远处，就在位于岛中心那片树林的某处，她听见有只鹦鹉正在叫着，“吃，吃，”它尖叫着，接下来是一些听不清的话，然后又叫着，“吃，吃。”

她的脑子里有了某种模糊和微妙的想法，是有关食物的，一时间某种不舒服的感觉袭来，就好像吃了不合胃口的东西，但过了一会儿又变得热情洋溢地兴奋起来。她转过身开始奔跑——在这个岛上是不可能慢慢闲逛的，因为周围热浪滚滚，海浪不断地拍打海岸，头顶是令人觉得不可思议的蓝天——她跑进了并不感到凉快的树荫中，从一个树荫跑到另一个树荫，想找到一块真正凉快的树荫。

“你好，”那只鹦鹉急促而含混地叫着，“你好，谁在那儿，吃？”她能够看见它正在树林中飞来飞去，只留下了难听的尖叫声和难看的红黄相间的影子。

树林中的青草倒是繁茂而嫩绿，她在小溪旁坐了下来，食物已经摆放到了溪边。今天，这儿放着一只打磨得很光滑的大木碗，盛满了紫色的葡萄。透过树林的间隙，阳光不均匀地洒向地面，把碗照得光辉夺目，反而映衬着葡萄满是灰尘，但带着几乎是黑色的暖意。这儿还有一个发着微光的盛满深红葡萄酒的玻璃杯，以及一个平底的蓝色的盘子，盛满了小点心。她伸手拿了一块儿点心，上面满是奶油，还有一层厚厚的、软软的冰冻巧克力。还有石榴、奶酪、以及小小的、味道强劲的糖果。她在食物的旁边躺了下来，闭上了眼睛，嗅着从葡萄上散发出的果香味儿。

“吃，吃。”鹦鹉在她头顶上尖叫着。她懒懒地睁开了眼睛，向上看着，看到树林间有红黄相间的影子在闪动。“安静点儿，你这个烦人的小坏蛋。”她说道，然后又自己笑了，因为实际上，这只鹦鹉安静与否微不足道。后来，她睡着了。醒后她吃了一些葡萄、奶酪，还有几块浓厚香甜的小点心。当她吃东西的时候，鹦鹉小心翼翼地凑近她，眼巴巴地要吃的，它飞到装满点心的盘子附近，然后又很快地飞跑了。

“小坏蛋，”她开心地冲着鹦鹉飞走的方向说道，“贪心的小坏蛋。”

当她意识到自己快把食物一扫而光时，特意把一块小点心放到了一片绿叶上，把它放在离自己稍微远一点儿的地方，打算留给那只鹦鹉吃。鹦鹉战战兢兢缓慢地飞到小点心附近，左右四顾以防有敌人突然扑来。当最后来到小点心旁边时，它又迟疑了一下，然后低下了头，把喙埋到了点心柔软的奶霜中。一会儿，它又抬起头，停下来四下观察，又过了一会儿，再次低下头把喙伸向了点心。这姿势很熟悉，她开口笑了起来，但不知道为什么。

她模模糊糊地感觉到自己又睡着了，醒来后又有了跑步的想法，想从林中跑到海滩的热沙地上，绕着小岛边奔跑，边呼啸。鹦鹉已经飞走了，点心已经一片狼藉，碎屑、奶霜满地。她从树林中跑了出来，来到了海滩，海水依然汹涌，天空依然湛蓝。她跑了好一阵子后，冲向了海边，在海浪冲到她的光着的脚丫前又迅速地跑回了岸边。然后她四脚八叉放肆地躺到了沙滩上。过了一会儿，她开始在沙滩上画画，一张圆脸，画两个圆点当作眼睛，还有鼻子，画一条线当作嘴巴。“亨利·保罗，”她说道，用她的手指疼爱地摸着画像中的脸，接着又开心地大笑起来，她站起身跳起脚，又开始环岛奔跑起来。当她经过沙滩上的画像时，用一只光着的脚踏了上去，然后用脚把画胡乱涂抹掉了。“吃，吃。”她听见鹦鹉正在林中叫着。鹦鹉害怕滚烫的沙滩，还有汹涌的波涛，所以远远地在树林间靠近食物的地方待着。她的目光越过大海，在遥远海面的尽头，能看见甜蜜的、总能带给她安慰的地平线。

当她跑累了的时候，会再次躺倒在沙滩上，无所事事地玩一会儿，在沙滩上写字，然后又用手把它们都抹掉。她还一度画了一个很粗糙的房屋的大门口，结果又用拳头把它给毁了。

最后，她倒在了沙滩上，把脸埋在了沙子里，沙子很热，比别的东西都热，软软的细沙滑到了嘴里，这样她能尝到沙子的滋味，它们在唇齿之间是又硬味道又独特的颗粒，但在她的眼中，它们代表着富裕和温暖。沙子盖在她的脸上，蓝天高高在上，可沙子变得凉爽了，然后变得更灰暗了，脸上的沙子最后变冷了。




“快到家了，”当她们拐过自己街区的最后一个弯时，奥克斯小姐欢快地说道，“这步散得挺好，不是吗？”

路过面包房时，她想加快脚步引导蒙塔古太太走过去，可没有成功。蒙塔古太太的双脚习惯性地抵制住了奥克斯小姐的催促，自觉不自觉地站到了面包房的橱窗前。

“我不知道为什么他们会把那些脏兮兮的长条泡芙拿到这儿来，”奥克斯小姐懊恼地说道，“让人大倒胃口，你瞧那个点心，奶油都结块了。”

她像哄小孩儿似的用胳膊搂着蒙塔古太太，“用不了多一会儿我们就到家了，”她轻声细语地说道，“到家后，我们可以先喝点儿好喝的鸡尾酒，休息几分钟，然后就该吃晚饭了。”

“漂亮，”蒙塔古太太眼瞅着点心说道，“我想吃。”

奥克斯小姐变得情绪暴躁起来，“不许说那样的话，”随后又哄道，“只是看看那种东西，都会恶心好一阵子的。”

她推着蒙塔古太太沿街快速走着，比刚才不紧不慢的散步快了很多，回到了自己所住的大楼。穿着灰色制服的看门人在门口等着，为她们打开了楼门。他先跟蒙塔古太太打了个招呼，然后对着奥克斯小姐问道：“散步散得很不错吧？”

“相当不错，谢谢。”奥克斯小姐随口应道。她们穿过大门进到了大堂里，电梯门正开着等着她们。“很快就吃晚饭了。”在穿过大堂时，奥克斯小姐对蒙塔古太太说道。

到了她们房间所在的楼层，奥克斯小姐留神观察蒙塔古太太是否能够自己找到家门。当她把钥匙插进房门锁眼时，蒙塔古太太面无表情地站在那儿等着。

房门打开了，蒙塔古太太机械地抬腿正要迈进屋门，奥克斯小姐抓着她的手臂，尖声叫道：“别踩到上面！”蒙塔古太太停住了脚步等在那里。奥克斯小姐从门内的地板上捡起了晚饭的菜单，菜单是在她们外出散步时，从门缝下面塞进来的。

进了屋，奥克斯小姐摘掉了蒙塔古太太的玫瑰花女帽，帮她脱掉了貂皮大衣，而蒙塔古太太用双手抱着大衣，一屁股坐在了椅子上，然后用手摩挲着皮毛。奥克斯小姐把自己的外套也脱掉了，整齐地挂在了衣柜中，然后回到客厅，拿起了菜单。

“鸡肝煎蛋，”奥克斯小姐边走边念着菜单，“上次这道菜有点儿不熟。当然，我跟他们提了，可他们好像并不在意。还有烤火鸡、菲力牛排。我真的觉得一小块儿不错的……”她抬头看着蒙塔古太太，微笑着问道：“饿了吗？”

“不饿，”蒙塔古太太赌气地说，“我吃饱了。”

“吃点儿燕麦粥吧？”奥克斯小姐说道，“如果你表现不错的话，今天晚上还可以吃冰激凌。”

“不想吃冰激凌。”蒙塔古太太说。

奥克斯小姐叹了口气，然后继续用安抚的语气说：“好了……”她又看着菜单，“炸薯条，”她念道，“这种东西不太好消化，但是我有心要一份上好的牛排和一些炸薯条。听上去今天的晚餐挺不错。”

“我能把这件大衣送你吗？”蒙塔古太太冷不丁地问道。

奥克斯小姐正走向电话机旁，听到这话停下了脚步，轻轻地拍着蒙塔古太太的肩膀，“您真是太大方了，亲爱的，”她说道，“但是您肯定并不想把您漂亮的大衣送给我，否则您亲爱的儿子会怎么说？”

蒙塔古太太满是怜爱地用手在大衣的皮毛上反复摩挲，然后她慢慢地站起了身子，大衣滑落到了地板上。

“我要去涂色了。”她大声宣告着。

奥克斯小姐从电话机旁转过身子，捡起了大衣，把它重新放回到了椅子背上。“好的。”她说道。接着她又走向电话机，坐了下来，以便能一边打电话，一边用眼睛看着点儿蒙塔古太太。她对着电话说道：“客房服务。”

蒙塔古太太慢慢挪动着穿过了房间，坐在了棋牌桌旁。她若有所思地一页一页翻动着填涂画册，发现了自己感兴趣的图画，于是打开了彩色蜡笔盒。奥克斯小姐小声地对着话筒，“是客房服务吗？”她最后说道，“我要预订晚餐，请送到蒙塔古太太的套房里来。”她的目光越过电话，盯着蒙塔古太太问道：“您还好吧，亲爱的？”

蒙塔古太太没有转身，不耐烦地动了动肩膀，然后从盒子里选了一支蜡笔。她很仔细地审视了蜡笔头老半天。而这时，她听见奥克斯小姐对着电话说：“请给我们拿一杯甜马丁尼酒，还有蒙塔古太太喝的李子汁。”她拿起菜单，舔了舔嘴唇，然后又说道：“一份蟹肉，番茄酱加鸡尾酒调汁。今天晚上按照食谱蒙塔古太太应该吃牛奶加燕麦了，可昨天晚上你们送的是奶油。是的，请送牛奶。你觉得他们这会儿应该知道吧，”她的目光再次越过电话机，落到了蒙塔古太太身上，“现在让我看一下，”她冲着话筒说道，目光又落到了菜单上。

蒙塔古太太根本没有理会奥克斯小姐，蒙塔古太太早已经开始涂色了。她的双臂弯曲着探向画册，苍老的脸上挂着一丝若有若无的微笑，全神贯注地给一张农场的图画涂着颜色。图画上有一只母鸡和三只小鸡在昂首阔步地溜达，背景是一个被树木所环绕的谷仓。蒙塔古太太已经费劲劳神地把母鸡和三只小鸡，谷仓和树木都涂上了鲜艳的蓝色。现在，她正不停地交替拿着蜡笔，聚精会神地在蓝色的树木上涂抹着红色和黄色。





夏季的人们


艾里逊夫妇乡下的小屋距离最近的镇子有七英里远，它很优雅地建在一座小山上。从小屋的三面往下看，满是柔软的树，和即使在仲夏也很少安静而干枯地躺倒的草。在小屋的另一面，是一座湖泊，木制的码头一直通向湖边，站在房屋的前门廊上，湖水看上去也一样赏心悦目，但艾里逊夫妇一直在费心修理和维护码头。从房子侧面的走廊或者木楼梯的任何一处都可以一直走到水边。艾里逊夫妇喜爱他们这座夏季小屋，一入夏就盼望着来到这里，而到了秋天也不愿离开。因为考虑到这所房子本身的状况，以及依山傍水的环境对于他们的老年生活已经是很大的改善了，所以他们自己不想再麻烦修缮了。房子没有暖气，除了从后院用水泵不时地打上些水来以外，没有自来水，也没有供电。已经有十七个夏天了，詹妮特·艾里逊一直用煤油炉做饭和加热他们所有用的水。罗伯特·艾里逊每天用水泵打上几桶水来备用，到了晚上，就着煤油灯看报纸。他们两人本来是很讲卫生的城里人，可现在对乡下厕所的态度变成了无所谓和凑合了。在头两年，他们经历了所有在杂耍表演和杂志笑话中有关厕所的那些尴尬事，而现在，他们不再有客人来访，从而对这些尴尬事留下印象，于是也就降低了对厕所舒适和安全性的需求了。厕所就像水泵和煤油一样，成了他们夏季生活中一种难以确定的财产了。

艾里逊夫妇都是普通人。艾里逊太太五十八岁了，艾里逊先生六十岁。他们看着孩子在夏季小屋中成长，然后又成家立业，自己去海边胜地度假；他们的朋友或者去世了，或者住在舒服的养老院里，他们与侄女和侄子们也很少联系了。冬天他们告诉彼此，暂且在纽约的公寓中忍忍，等待夏天的来临。夏天他们告诉彼此，冬天的等待还是值得的，他们等来了去乡下的时光。

因为他们年事已高，所以习惯刻板规律的生活是没有什么可感到惭愧的。艾里逊夫妇一成不变地总是在劳工节之后的星期二离开他们的夏季小屋，但到了每年九月底或者十月初，虽然城里的气候依然怡人，但是四下几乎是光秃秃的，凄凉得让人无法忍受，他们又总是会一成不变地对回城感到后悔。每年他们都意识到，其实没有什么事让他们非回纽约不可，但是直到今年，他们才克服了传统的惯性，鼓足勇气决定在劳工节之后继续留在小屋中。

“我们其实回到城里也没什么急事，”艾里逊太太很认真地对她的丈夫说，好像这是一个新念头，他们俩谁也没想到过似的。他也兴奋地告诉她，“我们或许可以尽可能多地享受一阵子乡下的生活。”

结果，带着更多的喜悦和些许的冒险心情，艾里逊太太在劳工节之后的那天来到村子里。用一种打破常规的口吻，告诉她常打交道的那些本地人，她和她丈夫已经决定，要在他们的小屋中至少再待上一个月的时间。

“我们回城里好像也没什么要紧事，”她对巴布库克先生——这位她经常去买东西的杂货店的店主——说道，“如果能多住些日子，我们就可以多享受一阵子乡下的生活了。”

“以前住在湖边的人家，还没有住到劳工节以后的。”巴布库克先生说道。他正在把艾里逊太太买的食品等杂货放进一个大纸板箱中，住手停了一会儿，若有所思地看着一小盒点心。“没人会这样。”他补充道。

“但是城里！”艾里逊太太总爱跟巴布库克先生提起城里，好像能够进城是巴布库克先生的梦想一样，“天还是那么热——您真的想象不到。我们离开这儿以后，总是觉得后悔。”

“不愿意离开。”巴布库克先生说道。艾里逊太太已经注意到了，当地人最让人懊恼的一种伎俩就是，在聊鸡毛蒜皮的事时会换种说法继续闲扯下去，直至变成一种更加琐碎的陈词滥调。“我自己也不愿意离开。”经过一阵深思熟虑之后，巴布库克先生说道，随后他和艾里逊太太都微微笑了一下。“可是我以前从来没听说过有人在劳工节后还待在湖边。”

“好吧，我们打算试一试。”艾里逊太太说道。而巴布库克先生板着脸回答道：“试了以后，才知深浅。”

如同每次和巴布库克先生漫无目的的聊天之后一样，艾里逊太太离开杂货店时，总觉得巴布库克先生在外在形象上，都可以做丹尼尔·韦伯斯特雕像的模特了。但那只是在形体上，而在精神上……想想上了岁数的新英格兰美国佬的血统已经退化，会让人觉得不寒而栗。当她坐到车里时，跟艾里逊先生说了很多她的想法，而她丈夫只是说：“那是数代近亲繁殖的结果，人和地方都变坏了。”

因为这趟到镇子上属于他们“重要的”旅行，他们每两周才来一次。来镇子上买一些不能送货上门的东西，所以他们在镇子上花了一整天的时间。他们在一家兼卖报刊和苏打水的店铺里吃了一块三明治，然后把大包小包的东西堆在了车子的后备厢里。虽然艾里逊太太能够定期购买一些送货上门的东西，但是在电话里，她不能清楚地知道巴布库克先生眼下有哪些货物，而且她打算购买杂七杂八的单子总得往上补充东西，甚至快要超出所需的范围了。另外，当地刚到的新鲜蔬菜巴布库克先生也是现进货现卖，而刚进货的包装抢眼的糖果也是时卖时缺货。至于这趟旅行对艾里逊太太充满了诱惑，完全是出于偶然，他们曾经在一家经营五金、服装的杂货店里看见过一套玻璃制的烤盘，而这套烤盘好像是专为艾里逊太太定制的一样，因为当地的乡下人本能地不喜欢那些看上去华而不实的东西，他们更喜欢树木、岩石和天空这些亘古不变的东西。只是在最近他们才开始尝试用铝制的烤盘而非原来的铁家伙，似乎在当地居民的刻板印象中，被抛弃的石头器皿比铁的还好用。

艾里逊太太让人把玻璃烤盘仔细地包裹好，因为通往艾里逊夫妇小屋的是一条崎岖的山路，这些玻璃器皿必须经受住开车回家的颠簸。查雷·沃尔普尔先生和他的弟弟阿尔伯特共同经营着这家五金-服装服饰-杂货店（这家店其实有名字——叫约翰逊店，因为它坐落在老约翰逊小屋的原址上，那间老屋在查雷·沃尔普尔出生的五十年前被一把火化为了灰烬）。查雷·沃尔普尔先生不辞辛苦地把报纸摊开，一层层地裹住了盘子。艾里逊太太很随意地说道：“当然，我本来可以不着急买的，等回到纽约再买这些盘子，但是今年我们不打算那么早回去了。”

“听说你要继续待下去。”查雷·沃尔普尔先生说道。他苍老的手指哆哆嗦嗦地拿着一张薄薄的报纸，很仔细地试着打算一次只包一层报纸。当他包裹盘子的时候，并没有抬头看一眼艾里逊太太，“没听说过有人能在湖边一直待下去，在劳工节后还没人能待得住。”

“嗯，你知道，”艾里逊太太说道，好像有必要给他一个解释似的，“对我们来说，似乎每年都着急着回纽约，其实真没必要那么急。你都无法想象那个城市的秋天会是什么样子。”她很信任地对着查雷·沃尔普尔先生微笑着。

他很有节奏地给包裹缠绕上了绳子，艾里逊太太心想：他给了我一根足够长的绳子，本来是可以省下一截的。艾里逊太太很快地扭过头去，以免让人看出不耐烦的神情。“我在这里会觉得更有一种归属感，”她说道，“如果我们在别人离开后还继续待下去的话。”为了证明这一点，她对着店里远处的一位妇女露出了灿烂的微笑，这位妇女很面熟，可能她在某一年向艾里逊一家卖过浆果，或者她是偶尔在杂货店里帮忙的女人，还有可能她是巴布库克先生的婶婶。

“好了。”查雷·沃尔普尔先生说道。他把包裹向柜台外推了推，表明已经弄完，包裹打包完毕，一桩买卖完成，他准备接受付款了。“好吧，”他再次说道，“以前夏天来湖边度假的人们，从来没有谁是在劳工节过后还待在这里的。”

艾里逊太太给了他五美元的钞票，他有条不紊地找着零钱，找回的零钱份量很重，甚至还有硬币。“劳工节过后，还没人继续待在这里。”他一边说着，一边向艾里逊太太点了点头，然后一脸严肃地沿着货架间的过道去招呼两个正在看棉布家居服的妇女了。

当艾里逊太太路过她们身边，打算走出店门的时候，她听见其中一位妇女呛声说道：“为什么别的衣服都卖一美元三十九美分，而这一件只要九十八美分？”

“他们都是挺不错的人，”当艾里逊太太和她丈夫在五金店的门口会面，然后一起走向人行道时，她跟艾里逊先生说道，“他们是那么的坚定，那么的理性和那么的诚实。”

“你觉得不错吧，要知道还是有些城镇是这样的。”艾里逊先生说道。

“你知道，在纽约，”艾里逊太太说道，“比起在这儿买这些盘子，我还能省下几个钱，但是在买卖的同时却缺少一种人情味的东西在里面。”

“在湖边一直住下去？”在卖报刊纸兼三明治的小店里，马丁太太向艾里逊夫妇问道，“听说你们要一直待下去。”

“我们想充分地享受一下今年的好天气。”艾里逊太太答道。

相对来说，马丁太太在镇子里算是一个初来乍到的人，她是从邻近的农场嫁到这家卖报纸和三明治的店铺中来的，在她丈夫去世后就彻底在这儿安顿了下来。她的店里卖瓶装的软饮料，还有厚片面包夹煎蛋和洋葱，这是她在店铺后面自己的炉子上亲手做出来的。偶尔，当马丁太太外卖的三明治还带有丰富的炖肉香味的话，那是马丁太太在准备三明治时，正在炖猪肉块儿当作她的晚餐。

“我觉得以前没人会待那么长时间，”马丁太太说道，“至少，在劳工节之后没人待过。”

霍尔先生后来在巴布库克先生店铺的门前——艾里逊夫妇正打算上车回家的地方——跟他们说道：“我认为劳工节通常就是人们要离开的时候。”他是艾里逊夫妇的近邻，“听说你们要一直待下去，我很吃惊。”

“这么早就离开好像有点儿可惜。”艾里逊太太说道。霍尔先生住在离他们家三英里远的地方，他给艾里逊夫妇提供黄油和鸡蛋。时不时地，傍晚在山顶上，艾里逊夫妇在霍尔一家人上床睡觉之前，还能看见他家屋子里透出的灯光。

“他们通常在劳工节时离开。”霍尔先生说道。

开车回家的路漫长又难走，天已经开始变黑了，艾里逊先生不得不小心谨慎地沿着湖边的土路开着车。艾里逊太太向后躺在座位上，跟他们日复一日的休闲相比，经过了一整天跟打仗似的购物，此时她心情愉悦地放松着自己。那套新的玻璃烤盘，惬意地在她脑海中浮现，半蒲式耳的红苹果，还有一包彩色图钉，她可以用它们在厨房搭一溜新架子。“回家真好。”她轻声说道。这时他们的小屋进入视线之中，屋子的轮廓映衬着天空，就在他们视线上方。

“很高兴我们决定再多待些日子。”艾里逊先生对这个决定也很赞同。




第二天上午，艾里逊太太充满爱意地洗刷着她的烤盘，不能怪查雷·沃尔普尔先生，他也没有注意到在其中一个盘子的边缘有个小缺口，但这丝毫没有影响到艾里逊太太的好心情。她决定很奢侈地用红苹果做馅饼当作午餐；趁着馅饼还在烤箱上加热，艾里逊先生下山去取邮件的时候，她出门来到一小片草坪上，这是艾里逊夫妇以前在小山的顶部开垦出来的。她观察着湖面上光影的变换，当云彩快速地一会儿遮挡住太阳，一会儿又露出来时，光影一会儿变成灰色，一会儿又变成了蓝色。

艾里逊先生回来了，心情不佳。每次步行一英里远去州际公路边的邮箱取信，哪怕他也认为走走路对健康有好处，可如果空手而归的话，依然让他很郁闷。当天上午除了一份纽约百货商店的广告单，还有纽约的报纸外，没有任何的信件。报纸是通过邮件寄送的，很不稳定，总是比应该到的日子晚上一到四天，所以有些日子，艾里逊夫妇可能会一次收到三天的报纸，而一份也没有的时候也是家常便饭。虽然艾里逊太太和她丈夫一样，因为没有收到眼巴巴盼望的信件而有点儿不开心，但是她很快就把注意力转到了仔细阅读百货商店的广告材料上来了，脑子里想着当她最终回到纽约以后，逛商店时应该买些什么；要考虑买一个羊毛毯子，但现在要找到颜色好看的似乎不太容易。她思量着要留下这张广告当作购物计划提醒，但是她考虑再三，进进出出这间小屋很多次，想把它放在哪儿才妥当呢，她把它放在了椅子旁边的玻璃杯底下，然后在椅子上向后靠了靠，半闭上了眼睛。

“看上去要下雨了。”艾里逊先生一边歪着头看着天空，一边说道。

“那对庄稼有好处。”艾里逊太太言简意赅地说道，他们俩都开口笑了。

第二天上午，当艾里逊先生下山去取信件的时候，卖煤油的人来了。正好他们的煤油也快见底儿了，艾里逊太太很热情地招呼着这个男人。他在夏天的时候卖煤油和冰，再把人们的垃圾拉走。一个收垃圾的人对于挥霍浪费惯了的城里人来说是必不可少的，可是在乡下人看来，自己根本就不会有什么垃圾。

“很高兴见到你，”艾里逊太太跟他打招呼道，“我们的煤油正好不多了。”

这个卖煤油的人，艾里逊太太从来不知道他叫什么名字。他过去会用一个胶皮管装置往一个二十加仑的油箱中加满煤油，这些煤油可以作为给艾里逊夫妇提供照明、加热和做饭的燃料。但是今天，他没有从卡车上下来，也没有把胶皮管子从卡车驾驶室的钩子上摘下来，他通常会充满深情地把管子缠绕在卡车的驾驶室中。这个男人用令人不快的目光盯着艾里逊太太，卡车的马达还在运转。

“我想你们马上要走了。”他说道。

“我们还要在这儿再待上一个月，”艾里逊太太轻快地说道，“天气是那么的好，至少看上去是这样，不是吗？”

“他们已经告诉我了，”这个男人说道，“即便这样，还是不能给你煤油。”

“你什么意思？”艾里逊太太扬了扬眉毛，“我们只能买和以前一样多的煤油吗？”

“在劳工节之后，”这个男人回答道，“在劳工节后，我自己都没法搞到更多的油料了。”

艾里逊太太提醒着自己，就像她过去经常做的那样，当她和邻居产生分歧时，城里的那套做法对乡下人没用，你不能指望用对一个城里的员工可以奏效的话去反驳一个乡下员工。艾里逊太太一边露出迷人的微笑，一边说道：“但是你就不能额外多搞点儿油吗，至少在我们待的这段时间里？”

“你知道。”这个男人说道。当他开口的时候，会十分气人地用手指轻拍着驾驶室的方向盘，“你知道，”他慢吞吞地说道，“我采购这个油料，得到五十，也许五十五英里以外的地方去。六月份把它买回来，一般夏天需要多少我就订购多少。然后，我再去采购……哦，大约在十一月份，话说回来，大约现在油料就开始短缺了。”他似乎把话说完了，停下了正在轻拍的手指，用手抓紧了方向盘准备离开。

“可是你就不能多给我们一些吗？”艾里逊太太说道，“这儿没别人了呀？”

“我不知道你现在是否能从别的什么地方搞到油，”这个男人认真地说，“我是不能卖给你一滴油了。”在艾里逊太太开口之前，卡车就开始移动了。然后它又停了一会儿，他透过驾驶室的后窗子看着她，“要冰吗？”他叫道，“我能卖给你一些冰。”

艾里逊太太摇了摇头，他们并不太需要冰，而且她很生气。她跑了几步，追上卡车喊道：“你能想法卖给我们点儿油吗？下周可以吧？”

“别指望啦，”这个男人说道，“在劳工节之后，就更困难了。”卡车开走了，艾里逊太太气急败坏地看着它离去。想到她或许能从巴布库克先生那里，或者再不行，从霍尔一家那里买点儿煤油，心里才多少有了些底儿。“明年夏天，”她自言自语道，“等到明年夏天，就得让他想法求着我了！”

还是没有信件，只有报纸，而且报纸似乎固执地能够准时到达了。艾里逊先生回来后，郁闷之情都挂在了脸上。艾里逊太太告诉他关于卖煤油男人的事，他都有点儿心不在焉。

“也许他想囤货，好在冬天时卖个高价，”他评论说，“你觉得安妮和杰瑞到底出了什么事？”

安妮和杰瑞是他们的一双儿女，两个人都已经成家了，一个住在芝加哥，一个住在遥远的西部。他们恭敬孝顺，可现在每周一封的问安家信已经迟到了，而且迟了很多天。实际上，艾里逊先生收不到信件的懊恼也肯定是合情合理的。“他们应该意识到我们等他们的信件等得是多么心焦，”他说道，“没心没肺、自私自利的孩子，他们应该知道如何更好地做人。”

“好了，亲爱的。”艾里逊太太安抚地说道。她对安妮和杰瑞所生的气丝毫没有减弱她对卖煤油人的愤怒。过了几分钟，她说道：“期盼不会自动带来信件，亲爱的。我要去给巴布库克先生打个电话，告诉他在我的订货单中再加上煤油，让他帮我们送上来。”

“他们至少得寄张明信片吧。”当她离开时，艾里逊先生还在嘟囔。




在这些乡间小屋的诸多不便中，艾里逊夫妇不再感到电话有什么特别的不便。没有任何有意识的抱怨，只是屈从于电话的古怪。电话是放在墙上的挂机，这种电话仅仅在很少的社区中还能看到。为了接通接线员，艾里逊太太首先转动侧曲柄，铃响了一次。通常情况下，要试着拨两或三次才能催促接线员应答，而艾里逊太太只要想起不得不打电话，一靠近那台挂机，就会产生一种逆来顺受，绝望中抱有点儿希望的感觉。那天上午，她拨了三通电话接线员才应答，然后又是一段更漫长的等待，巴布库克先生才拿起位于肉案后面杂货店一角的电话听筒。他说道：“杂货店？”语气中还带着一丝疑惑，好像是在表明他怀疑有谁会用这种不太靠谱的设备联系他。

“我是艾里逊太太。巴布库克先生，我想我最好还是提前一天通知你我的订单，因为我想落实一下，我得再买些东西。行吗？”

“您说什么，艾里逊太太？”

艾里逊太太不得不稍微提高了声音，她看见艾里逊先生出了门来到草坪，然后坐到椅子上看着她，眼神中充满同情。“我是说，巴布库克先生，我想早点儿打电话预订我的货物，确认您能给我送上门！”

“艾里逊太太，”巴布库克先生说道，“您能过来自己取货吗？”

“自己去取？”在吃了一惊之后，艾里逊太太反而让她的声音恢复到了正常的语调。而巴布库克先生的声音却提高了，“您说什么，艾里逊太太？”

“我想让您跟以往一样给我们送货。”艾里逊太太说道。

“嗯，艾里逊太太。”巴布库克先生说道。艾里逊太太等着对方接着说下去，又是一段时间的沉默。她的眼睛越过电话机和她丈夫的头顶，紧紧地盯着天空。“艾里逊太太，”巴布库克先生终于又接上了话茬，“我得告诉您，一直给我干活的伙计昨天回校上学了，现在没人替我送货了，您知道，我只有在夏天才雇一个小伙子帮我送货。”

“我以为您一直能送货呢。”艾里逊太太答道。

“劳工节后就不送货了，艾里逊太太。”巴布库克先生斩钉截铁地说道，“您以前从来没有在劳工节之后还待在这儿，当然不会知道。”

“那好吧。”艾里逊太太无助地说道。在她内心深处，她一遍一遍地告诫自己，不能用城里人的方式和这帮乡下人打交道，生气是没有用的。

“您能肯定吗？”她最后还是想做一番努力，“您就不能今天再给我们送一次货吗，巴布库克先生？”

“事实上，”巴布库克先生答道，“我想我办不到，艾里逊太太。送货几乎是免费的，可现在湖边没其他人住了。”

“那还有霍尔先生一家呢？”艾里逊太太突然想起了什么似的急忙问道，“就是住在离我们只有三英里左右的那一家人，霍尔先生回来的时候也许能够帮我捎回来。”

“霍尔先生？”巴布库克先生说道，“是约翰·霍尔吗？他们已经去州北部地区探亲访友了，艾里逊太太。”

“可是他们刚给我们家送来了所有的黄油和鸡蛋呀。”艾里逊太太说道，心中充满恐惧。

“他们昨天走的，”巴布库克先生说道，“也许没想到你们会继续在那儿待下去。”

“但是我告诉过霍尔先生……”艾里逊太太刚想说些什么，又马上住了嘴。“我会让艾里逊先生亲自过去买些东西。”她说道。

“到时我们会把所有的货都给您备齐的。”巴布库克先生说道，这下他似乎满意了，说出的话也不再带有疑问，而是一种肯定。

挂上电话后，艾里逊太太也慢慢地走出屋子，再次坐到紧挨着丈夫的椅子上。“他不给我们送货了，”她说道，“明天你得亲自跑一趟了。我们剩的那点儿煤油只能坚持到你回来。”

“他应该早一点儿告诉我们的。”艾里逊先生说道。

面对着这样的好天，焦虑的心情不太可能持久。乡村似乎还没有像这样美好过，湖水在他们的脚下安静地流动，树林郁郁葱葱，简直就是一幅不可思议的柔和色彩绘就的夏日图画。艾里逊太太深深地叹了口气，沉浸在近可观波光粼粼的湖水，远可眺绿树苍翠的青山，独自感受温柔的微风掠过婆娑树叶的惬意当中。




第二天一早，天气还是依旧的宜人，艾里逊先生已经按时装备好了购物单，而“煤油”则用大写字母列在了单子的第一项。他沿着小路走向车库，而艾里逊太太用她的新烤盘又开始做苹果派了。她已经把做皮的面团和好，正开始削苹果，这时艾里逊先生快速地从小路上又回来了，猛地推开了通向厨房的纱门。

“真倒霉，车发动不起来了。”他大声说道，带着一种走投无路时的语气，他是那种缺了汽车就好像缺胳膊少腿的男人。

“车子出了什么毛病？”艾里逊太太问道。她停了下来，一只手上拿着削皮刀，另一只手上还拿着一个苹果。“周二的时候不是还好好的吗？”

“是呀，”艾里逊先生咬牙切齿地说道，“可到了周五就不好了。”

“你能把它修好吗？”艾里逊太太问道。

“不能，”艾里逊先生说道，“我修不好，我想得打电话找人修理。”

“找谁呢？”艾里逊太太问道。

“我想那个开加油站的男人兴许可以。”艾里逊先生奔向了电话机，“去年夏天他帮我修理过一次。”

艾里逊太太继续心不在焉地削着苹果，但心里有些忐忑不安。她竖起耳朵听艾里逊先生打电话，响铃，等待，最后终于接通了接线员，可接下去又是再次的等待，第二次给了接线员号码，接下来又是第三次，然后啪的一声挂了电话。

“那儿没人。”走进厨房的时候，他说道。

“他可能出去了一下。”艾里逊太太紧张地说。她不十分清楚究竟什么让她觉得紧张，除非是她丈夫完全控制不住自己的脾气，才可能让她紧张。“就他一个人在那儿，我想，如果他出去了，就没人接电话了。”

“十有八九是这样吧。”艾里逊先生充满讽刺地说道。他一屁股坐到了厨房的一张椅子上，看着艾里逊太太削苹果。过了一会儿，艾里逊太太安慰似的说道：“你干吗不再去取趟信件呢，回来后再打电话给他？”

艾里逊先生盘算了一下，然后说道：“我觉得这样也好。”

他站起身来，走到厨房门口时转过身说道：“可如果还没有信件呢？”他出了屋门沿着小道向下走去，在身后留下一阵可怕的沉默。

艾里逊太太忙活着她的苹果馅饼，但是有两次她走到窗前向外看着天空，看云层是否在堆积。这时屋里似乎让人意想不到地变得黑黢黢的，她自己能够感觉到雷阵雨来临之前的紧张状态，可是刚才她两次向外望着天空，天空明澈而祥和，好像冷笑着注视着艾里逊夫妇的小屋以及其余的地方。苹果馅饼可以放到烤箱里了，但艾里逊太太第三次向外看的时候，看见她的丈夫沿着山路向上走来，看上去开心多了。他一看见她，就急切地向她挥着手，把一封信高高地举在空中。

“杰瑞的来信，”当他走到她能听到他的声音的距离时，就马上冲她喊道，“谢天谢地，信终于来了！”艾里逊太太忧心忡忡地注意到了，她丈夫沿着这条缓缓的山路走上来时，还是气喘吁吁的。不一会儿，他来到了门口，把信递给了她。“一路上我都没拆开，想等到回来跟你一起看。”他说道。

艾里逊太太的眼睛落在了儿子熟悉的笔体上，很吃惊自己为什么也会这样急切，除了这封信是第一次隔了那么久才收到的外，她无法想象为什么这封信会让她如此激动。信件读上去和原来一样，让父母感到开心，觉得孩子很孝顺，讲述了爱丽丝和孩子们的种种情况，报告了他工作的进展，对芝加哥近来的天气也评论了几句，结尾表达了对父母的爱戴之情。对于艾里逊夫妇来说，如果他们愿意，他们都能背下一对儿女的写信模式。

艾里逊先生小心翼翼地把信封拆开，然后把它平铺在厨房的桌子上，他们倾过身子一起看信。

“亲爱的爸爸妈妈，”信的开头，是杰瑞那熟悉的、相当孩子气的笔体，“我很高兴和以往一样，能够给湖边的你们写信。我们总觉得你们每次回来得太早，应该尽可能地在那儿多待些日子。爱丽丝也说，你们现在不再年轻了，有了大把的空余时间，朋友也不多等等。当然，你们住在城里的时候，也应该多享受生活的乐趣。既然你们两人在那儿住得很开心，那么待在那儿也是不错的主意。”

艾里逊太太从侧面不安地瞟了她丈夫一眼，他看信看得很专注。她伸出手去，拿起了空信封，自己也搞不清楚想从信封上得到些什么。信上的地址和以前没有什么两样，是杰瑞的笔迹，邮戳上标注着“芝加哥”。邮戳当然得是芝加哥的，她很快转念一想，为什么他们会想到它会从别处邮来呢？当她回过头把目光再次落到信上时，她的丈夫已经翻过去一页了，她只能跟着接着往下看：“——当然，如果现在他们得了麻疹以及其他什么的话，他们以后的生活会过得不错。爱丽丝身体很好，当然，我的也不错。可能是因为我最近和一些你们不认识的人，名叫卡拉瑟斯的一家人总在一起玩桥牌。他们是一对很不错的年轻夫妇，和我们的岁数差不多。好了，我就写到这儿吧，我想你们对我絮叨这么多离你们很远的事情一定感到厌烦了。还有件事我得告诉一下爸爸，老迪克逊，我们芝加哥办公室的那个家伙死了。他过去常常问起爸爸的事情。祝你们在湖边过得愉快，不用着急回来。代表全家向你们表达问候，杰瑞。”

“有意思。”艾里逊先生评论道。

“听上去不像杰瑞的口吻，”艾里逊太太小声嘟囔道，“他从不写这一类事情，像……”她突然停了下来。

“像什么？”艾里逊先生问道，“从不写像什么一类的事情？”

艾里逊太太皱着眉又把信读了一遍，想在其中找到任何一个句子，甚至一个词儿听起来不像杰瑞以前的信件都是不可能的。也许只是因为这封信到得太晚了，或者信封上出现了几个不同寻常的脏指印。

“我不知道。”她有点儿心烦意乱地说道。

“我再去试试能不能打通电话。”艾里逊先生说道。

艾里逊太太又把信读了两遍，试图找到一个听上去不那么对劲儿的字眼。这时，艾里逊先生回来了，很平静地说：“电话线断了。”

“什么？”艾里逊太太说道，手里的信滑落了。

“电话线断了。”艾里逊先生说道。




这一天剩下的时间过得很快，在中午吃了脆饼和喝了牛奶后，艾里逊夫妇又出去坐在了外面的草坪上，但是他们的下午被压缩得很短，逐渐聚集起来的乌云掠过了湖泊，接近了小屋的上方，刚到下午四点就像傍晚一样黑了。然而，暴风雨推迟了，但暴风雨好像喜欢期待着那一时刻，瞬间吞没这夏季的小屋。所以，只有闪电偶尔在天际划过，没有下雨。在傍晚的时候，艾里逊夫妇在他们的小屋中紧紧坐在一起，把他们从纽约带来的那台用电池的收音机打开了。小屋中没有灯光，只有外面的闪电有时会照亮屋里的一切，黑暗中只有从收音机的刻度盘上发出的微弱的方形的辉光在闪耀。

小屋的简单的框架结构不够结实，似乎无法承受住来自收音机的城里的噪音、音乐和人们的各种声音。艾里逊夫妇能够听见这些声音穿过湖面在远处回响，纽约舞池乐队萨克斯管的声音在湖面上呜咽，一位年轻的女歌手的嗓音平和地飘散在了清新的乡村空气中。甚至某个主持人，正在热情洋溢地介绍剃刀刀片的种种优点，声音从艾里逊夫妇的小屋传出，再变成回声传了回来。他的声音不再是人类的声音，好像湖泊、群山和树林都觉得这声音讨厌，把声音反射了回来。

在电台广告之间有一段时间的停顿，艾里逊太太转过头，无力地向丈夫微笑，“我想我们是否应该……做点儿事情。”

“不，”艾里逊先生考虑了一下说道，“我不那么认为，我们只能等待。”

艾里逊太太迅速地吸了一口气。在乐队再次奏响平淡无奇的旋律之前，艾里逊先生说道：“我们的汽车被人动了手脚，你知道，甚至我都能看出这一点。”

艾里逊太太犹豫了一会儿，然后非常小声地说道：“我想电话线是被人切断了的。”

“我也这样想。”艾里逊先生说道。

过了一会儿工夫，伴舞的音乐停了下来，他们在全神贯注地听新闻广播，播音员富有变化的嗓音在迫不及待地播报好莱坞的一场婚姻，最近一场棒球比赛的结果，以及预计在下周食品价格要上涨的消息。在这个夏季小屋里，播音员向他们说着，就好像他们仍然值得收听到与之相隔绝的外面世界的消息，可收音机里的电池出毛病了，电量已经变得越来越少。好像不管他们怎样都无关紧要，可他们仍然属于另外的一个世界。

艾里逊太太瞟了一眼窗外，湖面很平静，树木变得漆黑一团，暴风雨快要来了。她聊天似的说道：“我现在对杰瑞的那封信觉得好多了。”

“我就知道不对劲，昨天晚上我看见霍尔家有灯光。”艾里逊先生说道。

湖面上突然起风了，在夏季小屋的四周旋转着，猛烈地吹打着窗户。艾里逊夫妇俩不由自主地往对方身边靠了靠，伴随着突如其来的一声炸雷，艾里逊先生伸出手去，握住了他妻子的手。就在这时，当外面的闪电划过夜空时，收音机里的声音逐渐消失，发出了噼啪声，两个老人在他们的夏季小屋中紧紧地抱在一起，等待着。





岩石


身处水上并不是什么稀罕事，但是对于宝拉·艾利逊来说，这可是一次非同寻常的体验。尤其是在一开始的几分钟时间里，她坐在紧挨着小船船头的狭小座位上，一动不敢动，生怕弄翻了船，特别担心小船会在毫无准备的情况下倾覆。她是第一个上船的人，坐的位置背冲着一座岛屿，而那座岛屿正是小船的目的地。她看着穿着防水夹克的年轻男子先扶她的嫂子——弗吉尼娅——上了船，然后又去帮她的哥哥——查尔斯，把查尔斯安顿在船的中央一个比较舒适的座位上。宝拉心想，查尔斯看上去很疲惫。而后她进一步想到，自己不会埋怨查尔斯坐在船上较好的位置上，或者安心地紧挨弗吉尼娅坐着，因为查尔斯前一阵确实得了一场重病，到现在也没有完全康复，在经过这次舟车劳顿的旅行之后，他看上去疲惫不堪。

“我真是太兴奋了。”弗吉尼娅喊道，她跳到船上时就像一个孩子。然后，她又用一种温柔的声音——宝拉和她现在都用这种声音——对着查尔斯补充道：“你现在感觉如何，亲爱的？”

“我真的很好，”查尔斯说道，“现在好多了。”

“那岛看上去太令人激动了，”弗吉尼娅说道，“你们看呀，黑黢黢的一片，嶙峋怪石映衬着天空，还有那完美的日落。”

“那幅画面是什么样的？”查尔斯问道，“你很清楚呀。”

“就像一个海盗的据点，”弗吉尼娅继续兴高采烈地说道，“或者像一座监狱或者某个——”

宝拉用调侃的语气说道：“查尔斯，你认为把弗吉尼娅带到这么个她能完全放纵自己浪漫气质的地方真的明智吗？”

查尔斯好像对她的话充耳不闻，对弗吉尼娅说道：“实际上，它恐怕只是一个相当普通的度夏胜地。”他对妹妹笑了笑，“你觉得我们应该为弗吉尼娅找一个海盗吗？”

宝拉无意间看了一眼查尔斯身后穿着防水夹克的年轻男子，他正在划着小船。她发现他此刻正在看着她，于是她很快地扭过脸去说道：“还是挺冷的。”

“是挺冷。”弗吉尼娅拉紧了外套裹在身上。

“我们在一年中的这个时节来，确实有点儿太晚了。”查尔斯说道。

宝拉马上回应道：“这个时候来才更好呢，你知道。这就意味着几乎只有我们自己，我们不必为社交而烦恼。”

弗吉尼娅几乎在同一时刻随声附和，“我也总是觉得这种早秋的日子是最佳时节，不管怎么说，很让人放松。”她模棱两可地补充道。

“好吧，至少我在今年还度了一次假。”查尔斯说道。

“我原来根本没打算今年能度假。”弗吉尼娅说道，“我讨厌在夏天出门，孩子们现在好多了，不再整天吵着让父母带他们去各种度假地玩了。”

“正如你所知道的，”宝拉口气生硬地说道，“我几乎没有什么度假的计划，要不是你坚持说，你需要我——”

查尔斯笑了起来。“你太过多虑了，”他说道，目光从弗吉尼娅身上转到了宝拉身上，“我提到自己身体欠佳时，你不必每次都大惊小怪的。”

“你可别那么想。”宝拉说道。

“我们都想忘记你生病的事。”弗吉尼娅说道。

“忘掉它吧，”查尔斯说道，“还要多久我们才能到达那个岛？”从他说话的口吻，大家马上意识到他正在跟那个穿着防水夹克的年轻人说话，可不知道该如何称呼他，应该叫他“司机”还是“船长”，或者是“艄公”，也许是“伙计”。

过了一小会儿，年轻人答道：“快到了。”

“这座岛有名字吗？”弗吉尼娅问道。

“附近的人们都管它叫岩石岛。”年轻人说道。

“真是激动人心的名字。”弗吉尼娅说道。她先是看了看查尔斯，又看了看宝拉。“它就应该被叫作岩石岛，就像一个据点，或者一座要塞，或者一个——”

“岩石。”宝拉说道。

“我们要在另外一侧登岛。”没人问他，年轻人自言自语道。就好像他搭载登岛的每一个人都会问一系列相同的问题，发表相同的评论，说到海盗和那幅画面，你知道，还要问，还有多长时间能到？然后就是岛的名字，似乎接下来的问题就是“在哪儿登岛？”或者“我们要在那儿抛锚吗？”或者“你怎样才能让小船停靠在那些岩石上？”，这一回，他一度显得有点儿不耐烦，也是有点儿厌倦摇桨了，所以在问题可能会被提出之前就回答了。宝拉料想到弗吉尼娅又要说“多让人激动呀”之类的话，所以赶紧说道：“查尔斯，你累吗？”

“不累，”他说道，这样的回答令人吃惊，“一点儿也不累，我感觉非常好，真的。”

虽然她并没打算看一眼这座岛屿，但是很快就要到达这个在意料之外的假期中不期而遇的地方了。可她自从踏进这条小船，就再也没有机会回头，她的后背就一直对着这座岛屿。就不转身，就不转身去看，直到岛屿近在咫尺她能够触摸到它，可最终，宝拉还是忘了暗自下的决心，转过身去看了一眼。映入眼帘的是一块锯齿状的巨型黑色岩石，在红色的日落光芒照耀下，正从她的头顶掠过。这里冷冰冰的毫无人性，也没有悲天悯人的踪迹，有的只是可怕的不断逼近的黑色岩石，还有棱角分明、不可思议的轮廓映衬着落日。她说（心里正在想，如果它太过可怕，我总该可以回去吧）：“查尔斯，你觉得怎么样呀？”

“我觉得还好。”他尖声说道。

“它简直太让人激动了。”弗吉尼娅说道。

船靠得更近了，可以看出岛屿好像是由一块巨石形成，而不是由很多岩石组成的。在一处小海湾，水边看不到鹅卵石和岩石剥落的碎片。年轻人把船驶入海湾，水边有向上的台阶一直通向岩石顶端的一栋房子，而房子似乎是从岩石中雕刻出来的。此时太阳已经落入海平面以下，只有一抹淡淡的余晖还洒落在天际。天变得更寒冷了，夜幕降临使得岩石看上去更加黑暗，台阶显得更加陡峭和湿滑。

“我们能爬上去吗？”宝拉一边从船上倾着身子看着台阶，一边问道。她意识到，大家都指望她站起身，从船上动身到台阶上。她迟疑了一阵子，然后思忖她几乎不可能留在船上，除非她选择和船夫一块儿回去。“我真希望这次弗吉尼娅能先挪步，”她心想，“或者是查尔斯也行。”可马上她又为自己有这种念头感到可耻，毕竟弗吉尼娅在后面的座位上不可能越过自己爬出船外，而查尔斯还在生病。那个年轻人很轻松地从船里迈步踩到一块岩石上，向宝拉伸出了手，她还记得早些时候，他就是这样帮弗吉尼娅上了船。她拉着他的手，发现自己几乎是连滚带爬地上了岩石台阶，全然顾不上斯文和仪态了。台阶并不都是湿的，不管怎么说，也不是太滑，实际上好像反过来压着她的脚似的，牢牢地托着她。

我是喜欢这儿的，她想。更让她感到吃惊的是，她发现台阶有种不可抵抗的吸引力，甚至在弗吉尼娅还未下船的时候，她已经转身开始踩着台阶向上爬了。起初，让她欣喜的是脚下的台阶的坚实感，后来她抬起了头，看见了高高在上的房子，攀爬的速度明显加快了。

“你瞧宝拉，把我们远远地甩在了后面。”她听见查尔斯在下面抱怨，他听上去不太高兴。她觉得他在生她的气，或许是因为她总是提他生病的事吧。在她的头顶，房子的窗户漏出了亮光。然后门打开了，有人走到了门口向下望着，好像想透过黑暗窥探些什么。

“谁在那儿呀？”站在门口的女人喊道。

冷不丁地让自报家门，宝拉在台阶上犹豫了一阵子，转过身往身后看了看。查尔斯和弗吉尼娅彼此帮扶着，慢慢地跟在后面。宝拉看到这一幕刚开始还有些小小的愧疚，因为自己没有跟他们待在一起，可没过一会儿她就释然了。随后，越过她下面一块岩石的弧形边缘，她看见小船正在驶离小岛，突然感到一阵恐惧，因为她意识到小船和船夫根本没打算和他们待在一起。那我们怎么回去呀？她纳闷地想，然后自己笑了起来，她又想到这个船夫肯定要一天往返好几次。

“你们没事吧？”她冲着下面的查尔斯和弗吉尼娅喊道，“用我回去帮你们一把吗？”

“我们没事，”弗吉尼娅抬头朝她回应道，“这些台阶对于查尔斯来说，稍微有些陡。”

宝拉转过身又朝着岩石顶端的房子爬去，与此同时门口的女人也站在那里观察着她。“你们终于到了，”当宝拉距离她足够近时，站在门口的那个女人开口说道，“我都快放弃能等到你们的希望了。”

宝拉暗想，这位女主人并非和蔼宽厚之人。“一整天，我们事事都不顺，”她解释道，“火车、公交晚点，等餐的时间太长，总之，诸事不顺。”

“今天晚上有什么吃的你们就将就吃点儿吧，”那个女人说道，“晚饭一个小时前就做好了，餐具也洗了，又收走了。”

“我肯定我们还不太想吃东西。”宝拉说道。她心里不太高兴，当她踏上最后一级通向门口的台阶，并没有停下脚步看一眼这个女人，而是掠过她的身侧直接进了屋。她所进的这个房间似乎是用岛上的岩石堆砌而成的，有那么一会儿，她瞪大眼睛四下打量着，全然忘了身后的房东太太。在巨大房间的远端，炉火燃得正旺，火光一闪一闪地呈条形印在四面墙上，可能是岩石中的云母在火光的照耀下投射出来的影子。没有悬挂任何图画的宽阔的黑色墙壁上上下下跳动着闪光点。影子在地面破碎，而地面上没有铺设任何地毯。家具是木制的，也很大，一张巨大的条形桌立在边上，两边是长条木凳。另外还有一条很长的有后背和扶手的木凳，它让宝拉的脑海中闪过“稳当”一词。还有好多把很大的四四方方的木椅，由于频繁的使用，椅子被磨得又光又亮。屋子里没有任何装饰物，除了来自熊熊炉火的光亮外，也没有任何灯光。

宝拉听见房东太太还站在她身后的大门口处，正朝着下面慢慢爬上来的查尔斯和弗吉尼娅大声喊着话。后来，宝拉听见不知何时进来的房东用非常平静的口吻说道：“您肯定想把窗帘一类的东西拉上吧，我料想。”

“您是在跟我说话吗？”宝拉问道，四周似乎没有别的什么人。

“还要摆上花，我想。”

宝拉凑到炉火前，站在那儿暖着双手。“这个房间可真是非同一般。”她说道。她正在设法确认自己的感觉，在众多感觉中，有一种是极大的绝望，还有对这栋房子、这个女人、这个房间不可遏制的厌恶。她努力安慰自己这是在一段长途跋涉后的正常反应，而且发现自从离开家后，一路上远非自己想象中的舒服惬意，有这种感觉也不足为奇。但比这种感觉更甚的是，她感到沮丧，这种地方可不是度过一个迟来假期的合适之所，她有些担心查尔斯和弗吉尼娅会怎么想。她暗暗告诉自己，也许到了早晨太阳出来时，感觉会变好，这时她听见查尔斯和弗吉尼娅跟房东太太打着招呼。

“我们的行李到了吗？”查尔斯马上问道。他出发前负责料理行李的托运。

“今天早上就到了，”房东太太说道，“它们都在你们的房间里。”

“太好了。”查尔斯说道。他走到炉火前，站在宝拉的身边。“寒气刺骨呀。”他说道。

“每年的这个时候，晚上都会很冷。”房东太太说道。

“这个房间挺特别的，”弗吉尼娅说道，“看上去好像是用岩石做成的。”

“没错，实际上它就是一大块岩石，”房东太太说道，“这栋房子最与众不同的地方是，它大部分都是用岩石建成的，我有本给游客看的小册子，上面描述了这一点，我已经把小册子放到你们房间里了。大家常把这一点看作这栋房子最具特色的地方。”

“确实独具特色，”查尔斯说道，“当然，您一定是卡特太太吧？”

“我是卡特太太，”房东太太点着头说道，“欢迎艾利逊先生和太太。”

“还有艾利逊小姐。”查尔斯说道，示意还有宝拉。

“没错，也欢迎艾利逊小姐，”房东太太说道，“我已经准备好了你们的房间。”

“太棒了。”查尔斯说道。既然现在不用再费什么体力了，他又摆出了领导者的姿态，他越过宝拉，感觉自己像个贵客般对着房东太太说道：“有什么吃的东西吗？”

房东太太遗憾地摇了摇头，“你们到得太晚了，你知道，”她说道，“我可以给你们拿些奶酪，还有啤酒。呃，如果你们可以等的话，也许还有一只烤鸡……”

“我只想喝点儿茶，谢谢。”弗吉尼娅说道。

“我也要茶。”宝拉说道。

“无论你能找到什么吃的，只要快点儿就行，”查尔斯说道，“什么省事就拿什么吧。”

房东太太礼貌地点了点头，然后走出了房间。而查尔斯带着一种古怪的微笑环顾了一下四周说道：“还好。”

“难道你们不觉得这太不可思议了吗？”弗吉尼娅说道，“那位不可思议的老妇人，还有这栋房子……”她对着墙做了一个手势，然后，好像突然想起了什么似的，笑着转向了宝拉，“你知道她跟我说了些什么吗，我说的是那个可笑的老妇人？”她问道，“当我快到门口时，她对着我耳语说，那位高个儿的女士是和你们一路的吗？”她又开口笑了起来，“她指的是你。”她对宝拉说道。

“她似乎不喜欢我。”宝拉说道。

“这些女人都是不可理喻的，”查尔斯说道，“别忘了她实际上是一个人孤零零生活在这个岛上。”

“住在这栋不可思议的房子里。”弗吉尼娅说道。




在大白天，一切都变得美好起来。他们睡觉的房间紧挨着，查尔斯和弗吉尼娅睡在一张带帷幔的四帷柱的大床上，宝拉睡在另一个小房间里，透过窗户几乎能够直接俯视水面。在早上，宝拉醒了，但还在床上躺着，有一阵子她看到房顶晃动的影子吓了一跳，然后才缓过神来，知道那是阳光照在水面上折射过来，然后又通过窗户反射到房顶的影子。她从床上起身，走到窗前，看着海水，吃惊地发现房间外面就是几乎直上直下的峭壁。这个房间在岛的另一侧，在昨晚他们爬上来的台阶的背面，而且这栋房子的绝大部分几乎是悬空在海面上的。宝拉往下看去，心想在很多方面这种地势对大病初愈的查尔斯来说格外有好处，对弗吉尼娅和宝拉来说，也是不错的选择。因为这座海岛的整个面貌缺乏让人腻烦的奴役感，这种奴役感是他们三个人都深恶痛绝的，查尔斯接受这种奴役感太久了，而她和弗吉尼娅又给予得太多了。在这儿，不再有沉重的奢华感和丰富的环境，有的只是清晰和明确的孤岛，而从大陆上看根本找不到它的踪迹，它突兀而又牢固地悬挂在海面上。房屋的下面什么也没有，有的只是坚硬的岩石，什么事也干不了，也许只能忍受海水不断冲刷着岩石，岩石不停地击碎浪花。

“我可以花一整天的时间，”她想着，几乎要大声脱口而出了，“只需站在某个地方观察地平线，或者坐在一块高高耸立的岩石上，也可以走到水边待上一阵子，再爬上岩石回到屋里。”

她穿上了一双厚底的鞋，因为如果去攀爬岩石的话，就必须要保护好双脚。她沿着房子宽阔的木楼梯下到了石头砌成的房间里，一大早炉火已经点燃，在透过窗户的阳光的照耀下，笨重的家具看上去油光锃亮。一块洁白的餐巾放在木制长条桌上，餐巾上还放着一个笨重的杯子，就跟她昨晚来时喝茶用的杯子一样，还有一个木制的盘子。宝拉走向一扇门，她事先已经清楚这扇门通向厨房。她把门稍微开了条缝，喊道：“早上好。”

“嗯，我在这儿，”房东太太从里面的某个地方应声道，“大家都起来了吗？”

房东太太把厨房的门打开，拿着一个陶器罐子走进了石屋，她把罐子放在了桌子上。“咖啡，”她说道，“你也许愿意吃鸡蛋？或者尝尝培根卷？新出炉的面包卷？”

“谢谢你。”宝拉说道。似乎今天早上甚至连房东太太都更快乐些了。宝拉心想或许这是因为她自己不那么郁闷了。“要是可能，这些吃的我都想尝尝，”她微笑着说，“我做梦也没想到会这么饿。”

“那是因为接近海水的缘故，”房东太太故作深沉地说道，“在这儿你的胃口准会大开，我知道有的客人一口气能吃下一整只鸡。”

“你能告诉我，”宝拉一边说，一边靠得更近，看着陶制的咖啡罐，“这些瓶瓶罐罐都那么特别，那么可爱。你是从哪儿找到它们的？”

“房子建好后就有了，”房东太太说道，“我留着它们是因为大家似乎都认为它们天生属于这栋房屋。”

“的确，只有这样的罐子才配得上这房子。”宝拉说道。

“但它们很难清洗，”房东太太说道，又消失在了厨房里。

这天早晨，火光在石墙上形成的晃动的条状影子，被阳光反射形成的影子所追逐捕获。透过宽大的窗户可以俯瞰大海，岩石也在阳光的照耀下闪烁，宝拉想知道这座海岛从大陆上远眺，是否就像海平面上的一抹明亮的光线。她从陶罐里给自己倒了一杯咖啡，心中赞叹它的厚重和结实。她手里拿着杯子站在窗户边向外望去。当厨房的门再次打开的时候，她头也没回地说道：“岛上的岩石又是什么材料的呢？我敢发誓它是黑色的。”

“也许是煤玉？”传来了房东太太的声音，好像还在沉思，“要不就是孔雀石？我记不住了，但在那本小册子中有说明。”

宝拉走到桌子边，坐了下来，橡木盘子里放着鸡蛋和培根卷。房东太太站在桌子边，一声不吭，只是在宝拉开始吃东西的时候才开口说：“今天上午你会看见我的另一位客人。”

“另外的客人？”宝拉说道。

“你一定想尽快见到他。”房东太太说道。

“他是谁？”宝拉说道，但是房东太太又进了厨房里。她吃完早餐，点着了一支香烟。然后，她夹着烟，端着咖啡杯又走回了窗户边。她拉过附近的一把巨大的木制椅子坐了下来，椅子几乎把她的整个人都遮挡住了。这时，传来了房东太太责怪的声音，让她吃惊了老半天，后来才意识到这声音不大可能是冲着她来的。

“她刚才还在这儿，当然现在可能已经走了。”房东太太说道。“你一个小时前就应该来的。”随后又传来了把木盘子摞到一起的沉闷的声音，房东太太又继续说道：“我需要你的时候，不能总去喊你呀。这儿的客人需要吃的、住的，还需要提供各种服务，而我从来不知道你跑到哪里去了。”

既然她无意偷听，宝拉认为她唯一能做的就是马上站起身来，走到桌子边再给自己倒一杯咖啡，表示自己并没有听见什么。可事实证明，这并非像她想的那样简单，因为她看见了房东太太脸上惊愕的表情。

“哦，她还在这儿，”房东太太说道，“这儿还有个客人，小姐。”

我希望她不会对所有的客人说话都这样莽撞，宝拉心想，然后她转身对客人微笑着。但她马上感到有种触电的感觉，好像这个人她似曾相识，但旋即意识到自己以前从未见过他。“您好。”她打着招呼，又立即住了嘴，因为她还不知道他的尊姓大名。

“您好，艾利逊小姐。”他彬彬有礼地说道，但是声音很小，她一时无法完全断定他是否在叫她的名字。他似乎很怕她，于是她也忍住了问他名字的念头，只是又微微一笑，说道：“我正在窗户这儿欣赏大海的景色呢。”

“那也是我喜欢岛屿的原因。”他说道。他说话的腔调和态度表明他活脱脱是个唯唯诺诺之人，无法停顿下来形成有条理的谈话。他的个头很矮，双手放在身前，有一种卑躬屈膝的感觉。唯一和他的胆怯相悖的是，他没有试图遮掩他注视她的目光，就像害羞的人常做的那样，而是用一种着迷般的眼神目不转睛地盯着她。宝拉生气地回瞪了他一眼，心想他的眼睛几乎和岩石有着一样的颜色和质地。

“实际上，我刚才正在等您的嫂嫂。”他说道。

“她一会儿就下来了。”宝拉说道，忍住了笑。弗吉尼娅也属于小巧玲珑型，这个胆怯害羞的小个男人一定会让她感到踏实些的。“昨天经过一番跋涉，她累坏了，我也希望她能多睡会儿。”

“当然，您肯定是这样希望的。”他嗫嚅道。

“谢谢您，”宝拉严肃地说道，“您在这儿待了很长时间了吗？”

“待了有一阵子了，”小个男人嘟囔道，“实际上，待了很长时间了。”

“我知道在每年更早些的时候，这儿可是个游人如织的地方。”

“没那么多人，只不过人稍微多一些罢了。”他认真地看着她。“并没有很多人把海岛当成宾至如归的地方。”他说道。

“我认为只有一种人会觉得这儿很刺激。”宝拉说道。她再一次把目光转移到窗户外，凝视着下面的海水。“对我哥哥来说，尤其是现在，这儿是个绝佳的好地方。他病得很重，恰好需要这种偏僻、刺激的地点。”

“海岛也许对他身体康复大有益处。”小个男人礼貌地回应道。

“我希望如此。”宝拉说道。她正在思考海岛上这样一个封闭有形的世界，还有四面的大海如何会对查尔斯有着格外的帮助，也许是因为他别无选择只能面对岩石和海水，无法把他的思想浪费在无数劳心费神的事情上。他来这儿所能看到的一切，正如她坚信不疑的愿望，就是岩石的稳固和海水的流动，而且他会意识到岩石是可以依靠和居住的地方，而海水则是靠不住的。如果可能，甚至把查尔斯限制在岛上生活一段时间，他会把岛的概念印在脑海中带走，而这一概念会让他记忆深刻，只有这种坚固的岩石才是永远靠得住的……这时，小个男人的声音打断了她的思路，“要知道，您也许还不能完全理解这些岩石。”

“您说什么？”

“嗯，这些岩石在这儿有很多年了，当然……岩石是一种很坚硬的东西，可以摆脱……”

“我不明白。”

“完全没有关系，”他紧张兮兮地说道，“您哥哥的病——让您很担心吗？”

“当然。”她说道。她刚才提到查尔斯的身体状况的本意就是一种提醒。看来这种做法是最明智的，她认为，这可以让这位客人立马知道查尔斯的确得了重病，不能被人打扰，别的人也确实不必费心地去对他的病况胡乱猜测。但是，她没料到这场聊天竟然让这小个男人觉得他有权利去询问很多私人问题。她原来觉得他最多礼貌地小声嘟囔两句，表示一下同情就完了。

“对您来说，照顾病人一定很艰难。”他说道。

“您在这儿还会待上很长时间吗？”她希望自己的语气听上去不那么生硬。这些小个子的男人有时很执拗，然而从另一个方面看，他们有时又很容易被冒犯。

“不会待很久的。”他冲她微笑着说。再一次，她觉得长在他怯生生的脸上的那对眼睛，像极了她脚下的岩石。“我上午打算爬到那个高高的岩石上，”他说道，“那是岛上的最高点，一眼看去就会知道。”

“那一定很有意思。”她干巴巴地说道。

“我整个上午都会待在那儿，”他说道，“只需沿着您窗户下面的那条小路就能上去，再见。”

她站在那儿盯着他身影刚刚消失的大门，突然听到了楼梯上传来的脚步声。没过一会儿，她的嫂子走进了房间。

“查尔斯觉得很累，打算在床上多躺一会儿，”她说道，“早上好，宝拉，亲爱的。”

“早上好，弗吉尼娅。很遗憾听你说到查尔斯的状况。”

“这是咖啡吗？”

这时房东太太风风火火地进来了，看见弗吉尼娅有点儿大惊小怪。弗吉尼娅会吃新烤的面包卷和培根卷，也许还有煮得半熟的鸡蛋吗？弗吉尼娅会吃今天早上从陆地捎回的桃子吗？还有那个可怜的病人，用不用给他准备食物托盘呀？

宝拉站在窗户边，看着弗吉尼娅吃早餐。外面大海尖声的召唤早已使她在房内坐卧不安了，所以当弗吉尼娅邀请她坐到桌子边再喝些咖啡时，她发现自己根本不愿意挪动脚步，窗户是目前离外面最近的地方，而且她想让自己贴近大海。

“咖啡真不错，”弗吉尼娅说道，“我饿坏了。”

房东太太走到窗户边，站在宝拉的身边，从窗户探出身去。

“他正在爬那块高高的岩石。”她轻声说道。

“我知道，他——”

“卡特太太，”弗吉尼娅说道，“我能再吃点儿您做的美味无比的松饼吗？”

房东太太匆忙地回到了厨房，而弗吉尼娅没有环顾周围，直接对着宝拉说道：“她真的是不可思议，对吧？”

“你愿意今天上午出去走一圈吗？”宝拉问道，“如果查尔斯要休息的话，你和我一起去探索一番吧。”

“我愿意，”弗吉尼娅说道，“逛遍全岛——我都急不可耐了。”

厨房的门开了，房东太太回来了，她边进来边说道：“托盘已经给楼上生病的可怜先生送去了，我希望他吃完后会好受些。”

“卡特太太，”宝拉婉转地问道，“您能告诉我那位客人的名字吗？”

“你们两位女士一定想再喝点儿咖啡，”房东太太一边往咖啡罐里看着，一边说道，“真对不住，让两位在等咖啡上耽误了时间。”

“什么样的客人？”当房东太太又急匆匆地离开后，弗吉尼娅问道。

“一个奇怪的小个男人。”宝拉说道。

“还有这景色，”房东太太回到了房间，说道，“你们一定想好好欣赏一下景色。”

“我嫂子和我都觉得我们俩上午应该在岛上走走。”宝拉说道。

“你们确实应该出去走走，”房东太太说道，“如果楼上那位可怜的先生有什么事的话，我会立马上去的。”

“您建议我们去哪儿呢？”宝拉问道。

“嗯。”房东太太停下来，沉吟着，把双手放在她肥大的胯上，微微皱着眉头。“大多数的客人，”她说道，“喜欢沿着台阶下到海边，然后沿着海边的小路在海岸上溜达。或者是，如果你们出了前门往右拐的话，会发现一条小路，沿着这条小路可以穿过我们的花园。如果你们前些日子来，我会建议你们去小海湾泡海澡，但现在天气有些凉了，娇弱的年轻女士们就不大热衷泡海澡了。或许，你们还可以……”

“沿着我们窗下的小路走走怎样？”

“当然也可以，”房东太太说道，“沿这条路一直走下去可以又回到下面的海岸边，只是如果你们走得太远的话，万一楼上可怜的先生碰巧有事的话……”

“我们最好还是待在房子附近吧。”弗吉尼娅说道。

“您刚才正好问到我的厨房的情况，”房东太太冲着弗吉尼娅说道，“如果另一位女士选择出去散步，而您想留在这里随时应对楼上可怜先生的召唤的话，我想我会很高兴领您参观一下厨房的。”

“我很高兴能参观一下，”弗吉尼娅说道，“宝拉，你的意见如何？”

“这位女士一直渴望到外面透透气，”房东太太说道，“我们有些人是无法抵挡大海的诱惑的。”她有礼貌地冲着宝拉微笑了一下，然后又转过身对着弗吉尼娅，“如果您喝完了咖啡，”她说道，“我们趁着天还大亮，就抓紧时间吧。”弗吉尼娅站起身来，房东太太又扭头冲着宝拉说道：“我们等着您回来吃午饭，当心那些湿滑的岩石呀。”




“呃……约翰逊，”小个男人说道，“是的，我姓约翰逊。”

“我叫宝拉·艾利逊，约翰逊先生。”

“是的，当然了。实际上，恰恰是弗吉尼娅·艾利逊……是的，当然了。”

“这上面的景色真是不可思议。”

“难道不是吗？我觉得您会对您哥哥的声音厌烦的，对吗？”

“为什么，我可不知道我会厌烦。当然，他是病得很厉害。”

“没错。”

“我们两个人都有些不堪重负。”

“我们两个人？噢，是的，您是指弗吉尼娅，我明白了。”

“我们不得不精心照料他。”

“当然，那一定是殚精竭虑的。”

“嗯……很辛苦。”

“您的亲哥哥，是的，我很理解。而他的妻子是那么一个……我能说吗？……是那么一个依赖性很强的人。”

“她已经尽其所能了。”

“当然，尽其所能，是的。”

“她的身体也不太好，已经生了好几个孩子了。”

“坦白地说……我真的不喜欢孩子。我猜您也不喜欢吧？”

“呃……当然，对我自己的侄女们又另当别论了。”

“那是当然，她们是你亲哥哥的孩子嘛。但是您身上有那么重的担子，而您的嫂子又不独立，还有孩子们也是这样……您总把自己搞得筋疲力尽也就毫不为奇了。”

“一直挺辛苦的，没错。”

“另外，要理所当然地认识到，兄妹之间其实并不像血与肉那样联系得那么紧密，兄妹之间也没有那样的爱。”

“我们之间一直很亲密，约翰逊先生。”

“当然，非同一般，我敢保证。”

“也许我们有那样的联系和爱，也许我们太亲密了。”

“我想，没有了对方，你们俩谁都做不成事儿，当一个人病了的时候，另一个人的日子就不好过了。”

“太难了。”

“我想您从来没病过这么重吧？”

“从来没有。”

“但是我敢保证如果您得了重病，您哥哥也会精心照料您的，就像您现在照料他一样。”

“是的，他会的。”

“他有太多的事情要操心，他的孩子们，他的妻子。”

“他不会有太多的时间花在我身上。”

“他的妻子需要他，她是那么小鸟依人，她几乎不会让他有时间照顾自己的妹妹，他的妻子和孩子们在家里需要他，只有他妹妹才会想着他。”

“如果有事发生在我身上，我敢肯定她是最上心的。”

“最上心，是的，她确实很喜欢您，我猜想。”

“我们彼此都非常喜欢对方，情同姐妹。”

“也许对您哥哥的共同关注把你们联系得更加紧密，毕竟你们在分享宝贵的东西。”

“查尔斯对我们两个人来说都很宝贵。”

“当然了，他的妻子现在可能和他在一起。”

“我应该回去了。”

“根本不需要，如果她在那儿，您几乎是个多余的人。”




“那么，现在，”房东太太热情地说道，“您回来了，比我们希望的要早得多……开个小玩笑，”她看见宝拉皱了皱眉，忙补充说，“我的确很爱开玩笑，您在外面待的时间确实也不长。不用担心您嫂子，她在楼上和可怜的生病的先生待在一起呢，我敢说，她给了他更好的药，这个药是别人给不了的，就是她那张甜美面孔上的微笑。另外，您碰见阿诺德先生了吗？”

“阿诺德？他说他姓约翰逊呀。”

“那就算是吧，如果他自己这么说的话。我可能也会叫您阿诺德或者黑森什么的，真让我头大。我从来记不住别人的名字，这千真万确。不管他自称自己姓什么吧，您见到他了？”

“我很偶然地碰到了他。”

“那就是说您遇见了他，亲爱的，您遇见他了。您现在一定很想知道下次能在哪儿遇见他吧？”

“并不是您想的那样，”宝拉生硬地说道，“我刚打算要去爬……”

“又去爬那块高高的岩石？他这会儿不会在那儿了，明天也许会在。今天夜里晚些时候，您到那火烧得正旺的壁炉前面来吧，在我们都上床睡觉以后，您会在那儿发现他。”

“我当然不会这么做。”宝拉说道。

“呃，那会耽误您一段时间的，”房东太太说道，“但他会告诉您一些事情，所有的事情，包括这些坚硬的岩石。”当弗吉尼娅走进房间的时候，她很顺溜地继续说，“没人知道从什么时候起，这些岩石就屹立在这儿了。”

“查尔斯怎么样了？”宝拉向弗吉尼娅问道。

“感觉好多了，谢谢。”弗吉尼娅说道。

“我上楼去看一下。”

“请不要，”弗吉尼娅着急地说，“我的意思是，他说想睡一会儿，最好还是不要去打搅他。”




“当然，弗吉尼娅在那儿呢，她那么软弱，那么安全。”

“她并非完全地安全……”

“并非完全，但是为了你们，我或许可以做……”

“她很喜欢我。”

“她同样也很喜欢查尔斯，但是她又是那么依赖人。也是那么的漂亮，还那么软弱，那么脆弱。这样一个漂亮的女子。”

“她是那么需要我。”

“当然，既然查尔斯已经好多了，您就不是那么不可或缺了，他们能再次彼此照顾好对方。”

“本来就应该这样呀。”

“如您所说，理当如此，那您又该怎么办？”

“我想，我会再次回家的。”

“家？”

“我自己有套小公寓。当查尔斯得了重病的时候，我当然就离开了那儿，对我来说，和弗吉尼娅一起照顾他是义不容辞的事情。”

“但是现在您想回去了？”

“没人挽留我和弗吉尼娅继续待在一起。”

“他们又一次可以彼此拥有了，还有孩子们和他们的家。我想他们会对您有点儿愧疚的吧？”

“对我愧疚？”

“对您的离开感到愧疚，我的意思是，抱歉不能继续挽留你了。”

“我想会这样。”

“您瞧火光在墙上闪烁，当然，在这儿，在这间屋子里火是绝对安全的。这间屋子是坚固的岩石修成的，可是在这栋房子的其他地方，火可能就是危险的，因为这栋房子的其他部分是木头搭建的。”




“弗吉尼娅，你今天打算和我一起在岛上四处看看吗？”宝拉站在窗户边，现在在那儿吃早餐已经成为她每天的习惯了，她坐在一张巨大的木制椅子上，一边吃着早餐，一边看着大海。在白天，她发现海的声音、气味、景象几乎成为她必不可少的东西了。在晚上，她要么在石屋中坐在熊熊燃烧的火前待到很晚，倾听着外面大海的声音，要么在她的小床上直挺挺地静躺着，窗户在悬崖下面大敞着，大海几乎像是在她的房间里。“我们来这儿都快一个星期了，我觉得你都没怎么出过门。”

“外面总让我感到紧张。”弗吉尼娅说道。她坐在咖啡罐后对着宝拉微笑，“我开始有被这座岛给困住了的感觉。我开始怀念四下都是陆地，而不是海水的日子了。”

“查尔斯喜欢这个岛吗？”

“有时候喜欢，”弗吉尼娅说道，“有时候和我一样感到害怕。”

“害怕，弗吉尼娅？”

“你知道，”弗吉尼娅一边说，一边茫然地做了个手势。“你开始觉得有种和周围一切隔离开来的感觉，无处可逃，没有可以让自己再次回到家中的路。”

“我想在早餐后到楼上去看看查尔斯，”宝拉说道，“他在睡觉吗？”

“在休息呢，你干吗不推迟到午饭以后再去？”

“那时我可能回不来，我打算带上午饭，在那些岩石上待上一整天。”

“在那儿你能发现什么可干的事吗？”

“我发现那儿可刺激了，除了大海和岩石，那儿什么也没有，在大海和岩石之间除了我，什么也没有。”

“你能撞见另一位客人吗？”弗吉尼娅天真地问道。

“我有时会捡贝壳，但那儿没有什么很有意思的东西。”

“你有一次谈到还有另外一位客人，”弗吉尼娅固执地说道，“你难道没提到过一个古怪的小个男人吗？”

“我想我要上楼去跟查尔斯说早安了，我能花上一小会儿时间设法让他开心起来吗？”

“他已经够开心的了，你干吗不等到今天晚上呢？”

“我想现在就看他，如果你确定你不介意的话。”

弗吉尼娅一声不吭地跟着宝拉上了楼，走进了查尔斯和她共用的房间。自从他们上岛以后，宝拉每天都来这儿，可是查尔斯还从未下过楼呢。她抗议说不要让他整天在床上躺着了，他已经康复得足够好了。在他的房间里能闻见大海的气味，耳朵里总是海浪的声音，再加上房东太太每天把好吃好喝的定时给他端上来，他看上去好多了，宝拉心里暗想。他的脸色也变得好多了——让人惊喜，因为他从来没去过户外，甚至在屋里也没呼吸多少新鲜空气——而现在他充满活力，对于一个患病那么重、那么久的人来说，真是令人惊喜。

“早上好，查尔斯，亲爱的，”她一进屋，就开口说道，“你今天看上去状态真好！”

“我也觉得很好。”查尔斯躺在床上说道。他稍微坐直了点儿身子，转过脸让他妹妹在面颊吻了一下。“你看上去也挺好，宝拉。”

“我喜欢这儿，虽然恐怕弗吉尼娅会觉得很乏味。”

“她会吗？”查尔斯的目光越过宝拉的头，对着弗吉尼娅微笑着。“我不这样看。”他说道。

“你必须要试着走出户外，查尔斯，走到更贴近大海的地方去，我没法告诉你我发现那是多么的让人神清气爽。”

“也许对你是这样，”查尔斯说道，“弗吉尼娅和我更愿意待在室内，我们喜欢透过窗户观赏大海。”

“可怜的先生的早餐来了。”房东太太喊道，一阵风似的端着托盘进来了。“他是不是觉得我已经把他忘了？其实我只是在等着刚出锅的热玉米饼，他着急了吧？我要看着你把它们都吃光，我可怜的艾利逊先生，我们都希望你马上康复如初。”

“你要吃你的早餐了吗，亲爱的？”弗吉尼娅问道。她走近了床边，“对不起，宝拉，让我到前面来，给他摆好餐盘。亲爱的，你饿了吗？我刚才在楼下已经吃了一顿可口的早餐了。”

“早上好，艾利逊小姐。”约翰逊先生站在门口招呼道。宝拉抬眼望去，越过查尔斯、弗吉尼娅和房东太太的身子看到了他。靠着房门站着，他的个头好像更高了一些。“今天早上过得如何？”

“我吃了鸡蛋，还有自制的香肠，就像你吃的一样，只是我没吃到这些美味的玉米饼。试着尝一个吧，亲爱的，我相信这是卡特太太特意为你做的。”

“您可怜的生病的哥哥怎么样了？他好些了吗？还有您的嫂子，她怎么样？”

“早上好，约翰逊先生。”宝拉说道。

“你说什么，亲爱的？”弗吉尼娅问道，她扭过头看着宝拉，“你是在问查尔斯什么事吗？”

“我怀疑她是否会为我费心，艾利逊小姐。我非常怀疑她现在是否对我还有兴趣。”

宝拉转过身，瞪大了眼睛，先是盯着查尔斯和弗吉尼娅，弗吉尼娅正弯腰一边笑着，一边喂着查尔斯。她然后又盯着房东太太，房东太太正无声地观察着她，脸上挂着似是而非的幽默的表情。

“卡特太太……”宝拉叫道。

卡特太太耸了耸肩膀。

约翰逊先生继续口若悬河地说道：“一定是你们当中的一个人，你知道。我告诉过你我正在等你的嫂子，但是你先到了。这可是你自己的选择，你知道。我本来对你们两个中的任何一个都很满意。”

“千万别回答他，亲爱的，”卡特太太耳语般地说道，“没人会给他回应的。”她伸出一只手臂搂着宝拉，像是要保护她。“想法躲到我身后去。”她说话的声音很小很轻。

“没有用的，卡特太太，”他说道，然后，悲伤地微笑着，“一点儿用也没有，你是知道的。”他对宝拉点了点头，“她知道。”他说道，然后快速而悄无声息地离开了。





拜访


1


这栋房子本身，在什么事都没发生之前，就像她所见过的一件美好的东西一样，是那么的可爱。房子坐落在富饶的土地上，旁边有一个公园和一条河流，还有郁郁葱葱的小山环绕，经过精心规划和呵护的花园紧挨在房子四周。房子位于小山顶上，好像是件宝物，要防着人偷窥。玛格丽特的到访是一次经过深思熟虑的安排，多次来回的信件，频繁的见面，反复表达的愿望和期盼，所以当她和卡拉·罗德斯一起来到卡拉家门前时，她也觉得好像回到了家，回到了为之奋斗而争取到的地方。卡拉在门口停下了脚步，站了有一会儿，先是回头注视着宽阔的花园，还有一直延伸到河边的绿色的草坪，以及远处连绵的群山，然后又看了看这栋优雅的房子，可以清楚地看见屋里的支撑梁、弯弯曲曲的楼梯和拱形门廊，以及又高又细的横梁。房子依山而建，再往上是一排排窗户，还有屋顶的飞檐，飞檐后面是一座塔楼——卡拉站在那里，静静地看着，嘴角露出了微笑。她转过身说道：“欢迎你，玛格丽特。”

“这房子真可爱。”玛格丽特说道，然后觉得自己最好没说这话。

房门打开了，玛格丽特用手摸着身边的罗马神话中半人半羊的农牧神的头像，手上并不感到冰凉。她走进了屋内，卡拉一边跟着她进了屋，一边叫着用人的名字打着招呼，用人们的迎接似乎并不热情。她们在玫瑰红和白色的瓷砖地板上并排站立了一会儿。“再次欢迎，玛格丽特。”卡拉说道。

在她们远远的前方，有一个巨大的楼梯盘旋而上，她们所站的大厅只用雕花的细栏杆围着。在玛格丽特的左手边，随着后面的门被关上，一张挂毯在轻轻地晃动着。她能看清挂毯上编织的毛线，还有淡淡的颜色，但是想要看清图案，除非她站在远处，甚至可能要远到楼梯间，在那儿才能看清挂毯上的图案。她想，也许站在楼梯的中间俯视这个大厅，整栋房子才会像一个完整的故事那样显而易见。或许我能获得允许，慢慢地从一处移动到另一处，仔细观察每个地方？但这岂不是要用掉我整个拜访的时间呀？

“我从来没见过这么可爱的房子。”她对卡拉说道，而卡拉笑了。

“来吧，我领你见见我妈妈。”卡拉说道。

她们穿过右边的门，而玛格丽特想到要拜见这房子、公园还有河流的主人，未免感到有些紧张，在她看清这个明亮的房间前，卡拉已经把她领进了门，她站在卡拉的身边，低垂着眼帘。

“妈妈，”卡拉说道，“这位是玛格丽特，我的同学。”

“你好，玛格丽特，”卡拉的母亲对着玛格丽特友善地笑了笑，招呼道，“我们很高兴你能来。”

她是个身材较高的女士，穿着淡绿和淡蓝相间的衣裳。玛格丽特尽量表现得优雅大方，“谢谢您，罗德斯太太。能受到邀请，我十分感谢。”

“那是当然，”罗德斯太太温柔地说道，“我女儿的朋友兼同学玛格丽特在我们家当然会受到欢迎，我们当然也很感谢她能来访。”

“谢谢您，罗德斯太太。”玛格丽特说道，然后就不知道再说什么好了，只是知道自己心怀感激。

当罗德斯太太把她和善的目光转到她女儿身上时，站在她朋友身边的玛格丽特才终于能看上一眼房间的布置。这是一个淡绿和淡蓝相间的长条形房间，透过很高的落地窗可以看到外面的草坪和天空，薄薄的彩色瓷质装饰品放在壁炉台上。她们进门的时候，罗德斯太太已经放下了手中的刺绣。从玛格丽特所站的位置，她能够看到刺绣背面淡淡的精美的图案，各种柔和的色彩彼此融合。刺绣还尚未完成。附近的桌子上摞着很多书，一个很大的速写本十有八九是卡拉的，她的竖琴立在窗户边。透过一扇窗户可以看到外面的大理石台阶，缓缓地通向一个喷泉，泉水在阳光下汩汩而出。玛格丽特想起了自己的刺绣——一双正在给她朋友亲手制作的拖鞋——明白她无法把它带到这间屋子里来，因为在这里，罗德斯太太纤长的双手在刺绣花绷子上翻飞，轻柔得如同蜻蜓点水。

“来吧，”卡拉说道，用自己的手拉住玛格丽特的手，“妈妈已经说了，我可以领你参观一下这栋房子。”

她们重新回到大厅，玫瑰色和白色瓷砖组成的图案太大了，站在地板上看不出来。在穿过一个门廊时，可以看见一些小的铜质农牧神雕像正在向她们微笑。她们走进的第一个房间金碧辉煌，窗户框、桌椅的腿全都镀着金，小一些的椅子放在黄色的地毯上，地毯是用金色的丝锦编织成的，椅子的靠背也是镀金的。墙上有许多的挂毯，使房间看上去像是沐浴在阳光之中，甚至房屋周围郁郁葱葱的树木也显得光芒四射。这些挂毯被镶嵌到了墙里，边缘用薄薄的镀金框固定。

“这么多的挂毯呀。”玛格丽特说道。

“每个房间都有。”卡拉应声道，“妈妈把她自己房间里凡是挂着的东西都刺了绣，她在自己的房间里写信。其他的挂毯是我祖母、曾祖母和曾曾祖母做的。”

第二个房间是银色的，小椅子上铺着银色的织锦，窄条银色的靠背，这个房间四面墙上的挂毯镶嵌着银色的框，好像房间沐浴在月光当中，白色的光线洒在墙壁和窗户上，银光闪烁。

“都谁用这些房间呀？”玛格丽特问道。

“没人用。”卡拉回答。

她们随后又走进了一个房间，当她们四面环顾的时候，所有的东西都变得更小了。从房间两侧的镜子里，可以看见房门正开着，玛格丽特和卡拉进来了；接着，又反射到另一面镜子里，一个更小的房门正开着，变小了的玛格丽特和卡拉进来了；然后，又一次反射，一个比刚才还要小的门和还要小的玛格丽特和卡拉，玛格丽特和卡拉逐渐变小然后又反射出新的影像，如此等等，没有穷尽。房间里还有张桌子，桌子下面还放了一张小一些的桌子，在这张小一些的桌子下面还放了一张更小的桌子，如此反复下去。在最大的桌子上放着一个雕花的木碗，盛着另一个雕花木碗，这个木碗里还盛着更小的碗，如此大碗套小碗反复下去。房间里的挂毯绣的是这间房子在湖中的倒影，而这些挂毯本身也在倒影中，一会儿在湖中，一会儿在湖外，投射到了墙上的镜子里，好像挂毯中的房子又被反射到了湖中。

这个房间把玛格丽特吓坏了，因为她分辨不出哪些是真实的，哪些是虚幻的，她应该向哪个方向挪动脚步，挪动多远，她匆忙后退，把卡拉推到身后。她们从这儿又转向了另一道门，从门里出来后，她们又回到了大厅。在盘旋上升的楼梯下面，卡拉说道：“我们最好上楼吧，去看看你的房间。我们可以再找时间去看别的房间。不管怎么说，我们有的是时间。”她开心地拉紧玛格丽特的手。

她们上了楼梯，走过阳台来到了楼上的厅里。当她们刚走进厅里的时候，就闻到了丁香花的香味。卡拉的房间就像在一个贝壳里，房内是浅色的色调，桌子上摆着丁香花。

她们的鞋子踩在干净锃亮的地板上的声音就像雨点声，但是无论她们走到哪儿，都有阳光照在她们身上。“这儿，”卡拉边说边打开了一扇门，“这里是天暖和的时候我们吃早餐的地方。而这里，”她又打开了一扇门，“是一个过道，可以通向我妈妈写信的房间。还有那边……”她点了点头，“……是通向塔楼的楼梯，而这个大厅是我哥哥回家时我们大家跳舞的地方。”

“那边真是一座塔吗？”玛格丽特问道。

“还有这儿，”卡拉说道，“是一间旧书房，我哥哥离开之前是我们俩学习的地方，而他走后，我一个人待在这儿学习，直到我去上了学，遇到了你。”

“我们能到塔上去看看吗？”玛格丽特问道。

“从这儿走过去，大厅的一头，”卡拉说道，“是我祖父母、我曾祖父母曾经住过的地方。”她打开了一扇门，里面是一个长长的画廊，画上高大的老人们穿着带花边的浅色马甲，好像倾着身子在注视着玛格丽特和卡拉。接着她们又走到了楼的最高处，在这里可以俯身看见楼下的地面，也可以仰视塔楼，玛格丽特看着塔楼灰色的石头外墙，心里纳闷究竟谁住在那上面。卡拉指着下面的河流，河水正缓缓向远方流去，她说她们明天应该去河边散步。

“等我哥哥回来，”她说道，“他会带我们在河上划船。”

玛格丽特从房间里取出自己带来的衣服，发现唯有白裙子才有可能适合在吃晚餐时穿，她想到自己应该回家时多带点儿东西。她原打算在卡拉的哥哥回来之前，穿着一件普通的灰衣服下楼吃晚饭，可当她看到卡拉穿着一件淡蓝色的裙子，脖子上戴着珍珠项链时，就知道自己的这身打扮还是考虑不周。在晚饭前，玛格丽特和卡拉来到客厅，罗德斯太太很和蔼地跟她们打招呼，还问玛格丽特是否已经参观过画室或者铺着瓷砖的房间。

“我们还没有时间参观那两个房间。”卡拉说道。

“那么，在晚饭后，”罗德斯太太很亲热地用手臂搂着玛格丽特的肩膀说道，“我们去看看那间画室和铺着瓷砖的房间，因为它们是我最喜欢的房间。”

“来吧，我们去见见我爸爸。”卡拉说道。

这时房门打开了，罗德斯先生走了进来。玛格丽特现在刚觉得和罗德斯太太在一起自在些了，再次被不得不与罗德斯先生见面搞得很紧张。罗德斯先生大声说道：“那么这位就是我闺女在学校的朋友喽？抬起你的头来，姑娘，让我们看看你。”当玛格丽特茫然地抬起头，勉强挤出微笑时，他拍了拍她的脸颊说道：“在你离开我们之前，我们会让你变得落落大方一些的。”然后他又轻轻地拍拍自己女儿的肩膀，说她已经出落成大姑娘了。

他们一起走进了餐厅，四面墙上挂着这栋楼房在一年四季不同季节的画面的挂毯。用的餐具是布满金色纹理的白色瓷器，好像是从矿里发掘出来，而不是烧制出来的。吃的鱼也是玛格丽特从未见过的，罗德斯先生很慷慨地不断亲自为她夹菜，丝毫没有笑她没见过世面的窘态。卡拉和玛格丽特两人面前的玻璃杯里还倒满了淡色的香料酒。

“等我哥哥回来了，”卡拉对玛格丽特说道，“我们在餐桌上就没这么安静了。”她的目光越过白色的桌布落到玛格丽特身上，然后又隔着长条餐桌落到了她父亲的脸上，落到了她母亲的脚上。她继续说道：“我哥哥能让我们大家一直哈哈大笑。”

“暑假的这几个月你妈妈不会想你吗？”罗德斯太太对玛格丽特问道。

“她身边有我好几个妹妹呢，夫人，”玛格丽特说道，“而且我住校有好长时间了，她已经习惯我不在身边了。”

“我们这些做母亲的绝不会习惯女儿不在身边，”罗德斯太太说道，然后疼爱地看着卡拉，“还有我们的儿子。”她又加了一句，轻轻叹了口气。

“等我哥哥回来了，”卡拉说道，“你会看到这栋房子会是多么的充满生活气息。”

“他什么时候回来？”玛格丽特问道。

“一周之后，”罗德斯先生说道，“还有三天零四个小时。”

罗德斯太太站起了身，玛格丽特和卡拉紧跟着她，罗德斯先生也赶忙站起来殷勤地为她们三个人用手把着门。

当天晚上，卡拉和玛格丽特弹着琴，唱着二重唱，虽然卡拉说她们俩的声音太单薄，不够动听，需要有一个更深沉的声音加入，如果她的哥哥回来了，他们就会有一个完美的三重唱，但是罗德斯太太还是对她们的歌唱大加赞赏，而罗德斯先生则在椅子上睡着了。

在她们上楼之前，罗德斯太太提醒自己不能忘了承诺，要带玛格丽特参观画室和铺着瓷砖的房间。所以，她和玛格丽特，还有卡拉，用手高高地托着长裙，免得前面的裙摆耷拉到地板上，后面的裙边发出飒飒的响声。她们到了楼下的大厅，穿过过道，然后又来到另一个厅里，再穿过一个装满书的房间，最后来到一扇画着画的房门前，进了门是一间很小的八角形房间，周遭全部镶嵌着画板，画着粉色、蓝色、绿色和金色小幅画作，有牧羊人、仙女、小羊羔、农牧神，他们正在河边一大片绿色的草地上玩耍，而背景上矗立着这栋可爱的楼房。这个小房间里没有什么别的陈设了，因为似乎这些画作作为陈设对于一个房间来说足够了。玛格丽特觉得她留在这个房间里肯定会很开心，每天看着这些画上的小人物与动物在玩耍就心满意足了，都不用去看这栋楼房别的房间了。但是罗德斯太太领着她继续浏览，又进了铺着瓷砖的房间，这里几乎都称不上是一个房间，房间的一面全部是玻璃窗户，向外可以看见和八角形房间画上一模一样的草地。瓷砖镶嵌在了房间地板上，看上去每一块是一个明亮的彩色小点，可当你退后在远处再看它们，你会发现眼前又一次出现了这栋楼房的图案，而且这些瓷砖的材料与楼房的材料是完全一样的，于是在图案上的微小窗户是玻璃的，塔楼是用灰色石头的碎块拼成的，烟囱也是用真正的砖块的碎片镶成的。

站在瓷砖拼成的楼房之外，玛格丽特走路时提起了长裙，以免裙裾会刮到拼塔楼的碎片，使它们离开所在的位置，她停下来问道：“这是什么？”然后退后了一步又仔细看着，为了看清楚她最后跪了下来，好奇地问道：“这是什么？”

“她难道不是很迷人吗？”罗德斯太太笑着对玛格丽特说道，“我一直都很爱她。”

“我特别想知道当玛格丽特看出来时会说出什么话。”卡拉也笑着说道。

那是一张匪夷所思的女孩的脸的图案，蓝色的小碎块作为眼睛，红色的小碎块作为嘴唇，在地面上茫然地凝视着大家，长长的辫子是用黄色的石头碎片拼成的，匀称地落在她圆脸的两侧。

“她很漂亮，”玛格丽特说道，往后又退了一步，为了看得更清楚些，“它有什么隐含的意义吗？”

她又向后退了一些，抬起头来读着用碎片拼在一起，歪七扭八地镶嵌在地板上的字母，“玛格丽特在此，”后面还有一句话，“她因爱而亡。”





2


当然，她们没有时间把所有的事情都做了。在玛格丽特看完了这栋楼房的一半时，卡拉的哥哥回家了。一天下午，卡拉跑上楼大声喊着：“玛格丽特，玛格丽特，他到家了。”而玛格丽特也跑下楼迎着她，拥抱着她说道：“我太高兴了。”

他已经到了，玛格丽特跟在卡拉的后面害羞地走进了客厅，看见罗德斯太太满眼泪花，而罗德斯先生身板挺得更加笔直，比以前更加神气十足了。卡拉介绍道：“哥哥，这位是玛格丽特。”

他穿着军装，高大威严，玛格丽特真希望她能稍晚一点儿和他见面，因为那样的话她还可以回趟房间，盘起她的头发。他身边还站着一个他的朋友，一位上尉，个头不高，肤色很黑，一脸的愁苦，冲着聚在一起的一家人凄凉地微笑着。玛格丽特在冲他们俩怯生生地报以微笑后，站到了卡拉的身后。

大家立刻开始说起话来，罗德斯太太说道：“我们都很想你。”罗德斯先生说道：“很高兴你回来了，我的儿子。”而卡拉说道：“我们要做好几件事——我都许给玛格丽特了——”卡拉的哥哥问道：“这位就是玛格丽特了？”黑皮肤的上尉说道：“我一直想前来拜访。”

大家似乎每一次都选择同一时刻说话，但有时又都突然不说了，东张西望地想听别人说，甚至还有着长时间沉默的尴尬，但大家对于团聚好像有着说不完的话，于是不定什么时候又开始同时张嘴说话了。晚饭时还是这种情况：罗德斯太太说：“你吃得不多呀！”还有：“你过去很喜欢吃石榴的。”卡拉说：“我们去划船吧。”“我们还要举办舞会，可以吗？”“玛格丽特和我特别想去野餐。”还有：“我没带玛格丽特浏览河流，就是想让哥哥领着她去看。”罗德斯先生在喷着烟，大笑着，给大家递着葡萄酒，而玛格丽特几乎不敢抬头看大家。皮肤黝黑的上尉说：“我怎么也没想到这是块那么古老和有魅力的地方。”而卡拉的哥哥说：“这栋房子里有很多东西我都想让玛格丽特看看。”

晚饭过后，他们玩了会儿猜字谜游戏。当罗德斯太太和罗德斯先生表演“阿喀琉斯”(1)的动作时，罗德斯太太举着先生的脚后跟，两个人一边哈哈大笑，一边瞟着卡拉、玛格丽特和上尉。卡拉的哥哥靠在玛格丽特的椅子背上，有一次她抬头看着他问道：“还没人叫你的名字呢，你叫什么名字？”

“保罗。”他说道。

第二天早晨，他们一起在草坪上散步，卡拉挽着上尉，玛格丽特挽着保罗。他们站在湖边，玛格丽特望着水中楼房纯净的倒影，说道：“太逼真了，好像只要我们打开门，就能走进去一样。”

“那里，”保罗说道，他用手杖指着前面入口处的大门。“我们从这儿进去，水下震动，大门就会为我们打开。”

“玛格丽特，”卡拉大笑着说，“你有时会说些奇怪的话，如果你想进到那栋房子，你还得先下到湖里才行。”

“事实上，你根本不会喜欢下到湖里。”上尉补充道。

“或者，你会从侧门进去吗？”保罗边用手杖指着湖面边说道。

“我认为我还是更喜欢从前门进去。”玛格丽特说道。

“但是你会被淹死的。”卡拉说道。当他们开始走回房子时，卡拉抓着玛格丽特的手臂说道：“我想现在我们可以为挂毯再设计一个场景了，在楼前的草地上，我们做背景。”

“另一块挂毯吗？”上尉说道，并做了一个鬼脸。

他们玩起了槌球游戏，保罗把玛格丽特的球撞到了球门里，上尉开玩笑地指责她玩球作弊。晚上他们又一起玩了填字游戏，也是玛格丽特和保罗赢了，大家都说玛格丽特非常聪明。他们经常在楼前的草坪上散步，看着平静的湖面，观察水中房子的倒影，玛格丽特选了倒影楼房里的一个房间作为自己的房间，保罗说她本来就应该拥有一个自己的房间。

“可那个是妈妈写信用的房间。”卡拉看着玛格丽特说道，脸上的表情很奇怪。

“我们谈的是水里的房子，又不是真的。”保罗说道。

“在你住在我们家的这段日子里，如果你喜欢那个房间，我想她会借给你的。”卡拉说道。

“根本不用，”玛格丽特亲切地说道，“我觉得我更喜欢那个塔楼。”

“你参观过那个玫瑰花园吗？”卡拉问道。

“让我带你去那儿吧。”保罗说道。

玛格丽特和他一起穿过草坪，卡拉冲她喊道：“你现在要去哪儿，玛格丽特？”

“当然是去玫瑰花园呀。”玛格丽特回应道。而卡拉瞪着她说道：“有的时候，你还真是奇怪，玛格丽特。现在天变得越来越冷了，在玫瑰花丛中溜达太冷了。”于是玛格丽特和保罗又折返了回来。

罗德斯太太的刺绣进展顺利，她已经在布面上填满了楼房的轮廓，正在绣窗户那部分。在经过了一开始短暂的震惊之后，玛格丽特不再纳闷罗德斯太太能够不依照画好的图案和花样就直接绣出房子的样子。她全凭着自己的记忆力，当玛格丽特第一次意识到这点时，心中暗想，“这真了不起，”然后又会很好奇，“但是，房子以外别的部分她是怎么做到的？”

为了看清这栋房子的图案，罗德斯太太不仅需要从各个方向抬眼观察，而且更为神奇的是她从不借助别的模型就可以完成刺绣作品。当然，她对这栋房子外表的熟悉程度可能比对孩子们外表的熟悉程度还要深。当她观察罗德斯太太信心十足而又游刃有余地在刺绣的房子里添加门窗、雕梁画栋时，罗德斯一家在这栋房子里梦幻一般的生活活灵活现地呈现在了玛格丽特眼前。罗德斯太太还时常面带微笑地穿过房间，来到卡拉和上尉一起低头看书的地方，而她的手指几乎是自动地依然绣着雕梁的外侧，玛格丽特已经忘了或者从来也不知道这些雕梁是什么样子，直到她俯身探过罗德斯太太的椅子背，发现在罗德斯太太的手上，雕梁已经纤毫毕现地完成了。

然后，在她出神地看的时候，白昼里的太阳光线——让玛格丽特对这栋楼很着迷的地方——也在绣架上织成了。卡拉抬起头往她们这个方向看过来，好像在说：“玛格丽特，快到我们这边来吧，母亲总是忙着刺绣，但我哥哥可不经常回家哟。”

他们去野炊了，卡拉、上尉、保罗还有玛格丽特，当他们离家时，罗德斯太太在门口跟他们挥着手，而罗德斯先生来到了他书房的窗户边，也冲他们举手示意。虽然卡拉有点儿害怕走得太远，但他们还是选择了去那座远离他们家，长满树木的小山。“我总是愿意去个至少能看见家里房子屋顶的地方。”卡拉说道——她坐在树木中间的苔藓上，玛格丽特以前从来没见过这么绿的苔藓，他们在地上铺了一个白单子，开始喝红葡萄酒了。

这是一个郁郁葱葱的森林，有着整齐的树木和绿色的苔藓，偶尔还有紫色或者黄色的花朵不起眼地开放在小径的边上。这里并非完全一片寂静，但有时在树木之间还是能感觉到沉思默想般的安静。她抬头通过树枝间的缝隙能够看到朗朗晴空，玛格丽特意识到她在吃早餐的房间里，曾经在一块儿挂毯上见过这片森林，图案上森林远处的那栋楼房在阳光下闪耀着。

“那条河流不会是穿过了这个森林的某个地方吧？”她问道。她一边思忖，一边侧耳倾听着穿过树林的水流声。“我在这些树木中间觉得特别舒服，就像在家里一样。”

“那有可能，”保罗说道，“如果房子前的草坪上有一艘小船的话，一直把它往下推，它就会不声不响地下到河里，穿过这片树林，再经过田野，然后，不知什么原因就又会绕回我们家的房子周围了。这条河流，你瞧，几乎是围着房子绕了一个很大的弯。我们很为此自豪。”

“河就在我们附近，”卡拉说道，“它完全是在围着房子流淌。”

“玛格丽特，”上尉说道，“你不必那么专注地盯着野炊的食品，除非你正在观察大自然。”

“事实上，我是，”玛格丽特说道，“我在观察一只正在爬向卡拉脚边的毛毛虫。”

“你愿意过来看看这条河吗？”保罗边说边站起身，向玛格丽特伸出了手，“我认为我们可以看到河流就是在这儿附近拐了一个大弯的。”

“玛格丽特，”当玛格丽特站起身，卡拉说道，“你总是到处瞎跑。”

“我过一会儿就回来，”玛格丽特笑着说道，“只是看一眼河流嘛。”

“别待的时间太长，”卡拉说道，“我们要在天黑前回去。”

当河流在树林间流淌时，影影绰绰，水面平静，它在空旷处形成一个个的池塘，只有轻微的波动扰乱着在它边缘生长的蕨类植物，中间还有一些小块石头，仿佛一座随时可能被淹没的小岛，站在上面也许可以看清周遭的河水。小岛上一片沉寂，一片落叶可能会从一个视线所及之处飘向另外一个视线所及之处，落叶飘得很迅速，但是又让人不易察觉，在它行进的过程中会稍微拐个弯。

“谁住在塔楼里呀，保罗？”玛格丽特问道，她手里拿着一根蕨草，让它轻轻划过手背，“我知道有人住在那儿，因为有一次我看见窗户边上有人影在晃动。”

“没人住在那儿，”保罗打趣似的说道，“你认为我们把一个政治犯锁在那里了吗？”

“一开始的时候我以为是鸟儿，”玛格丽特说道，她很高兴能向别人描述一下她看到的情景。

“不是，”保罗仍然以逗趣的口吻说道，“有一位姑姑，或者姑奶奶，或者甚至是曾姑奶奶。她根本不住在那儿，但是她常去那儿，因为她说她忍受不了到处都是挂毯。”他大笑了起来，“她在塔楼里装满了书，还养了一只个头很大的老猫。她可能是在那儿修炼魔法，这一点大家都知道。你没有看见她的原因是因为她施展了隐身术。有的时候，她每天都下楼。”

“我见过她吗？”玛格丽特好奇地问道。

“也许吧，”保罗说道，“也许她哪天心血来潮会在晚上下来吃晚饭。或者当你坐在草坪上时，她可能漫不经心地走近你，介绍她自己。但在那一刻你可能根本看不见她。”

“如果我上塔楼去看看呢？”

保罗用奇怪的眼神扫了她一眼。“如果你想去，我想你可以去，”他说道，“我去过那儿。”

“玛格丽特，”从林子另一侧传来了卡拉的叫声，“玛格丽特，如果你不放弃在水边的溜达，我们会迟到的。”

在后来的一段时间里，玛格丽特几乎每天都要参观这栋楼房的某个房间：比如摆满扇子的房间，在这里有最为精致的金银丝做工的扇面，它们被放置在墙上，用象牙做的扇骨做支撑，扇骨上还画着精巧的微型画。一个不大的房间，但是在闪光的玻璃架上摆放着精美绝伦的木制、玻璃制和金属制的水果、花朵和树木，一溜排开对着窗户。她每天都要反复地经过一扇门，这扇门后就是通向塔楼的楼梯。她几乎每天都要小心地在地面上那几块瓷砖处徘徊，读着瓷砖上面的一行字，“玛格丽特在此，她因爱而亡。”

然而，玛格丽特想去塔楼上看看的念头越来越不可抑制了，也再不可能一天路过门口好几次了，她只能把手悄悄地放在房门上，或者还会把头贴在门上去倾听，听听是否有脚步声上下楼梯，或者有某个声音呼唤她。她已经不可能再次路过房门而不入了，所以在一天清晨很早的时候，玛格丽特把手坚定地伸向了房门，把门拉开了。这动作虽然轻松，但她好像是终于能够如释重负似的，经过了那么多的暗示和影射，还有那么多的等待和无助的绝望，玛格丽特最后鼓足勇气打开了它。

门后的楼梯是用灰色的石头砌成的，很粗糙，玛格丽特心里想，对于一位上了年岁的老妇人来说，这楼梯似乎陡了点儿。虽然有些胆怯，但玛格丽特还是毫不费劲地爬上了楼梯。楼梯转了一圈又一圈，一直通向塔楼，玛格丽特很小心地抬脚一级一级台阶地向上爬，伸出双手摸索着一侧温暖的石墙，向前也向上张望，希望在到达楼梯最上方之前，有人能看见她或者跟她说话。她还一度联想，也许塔楼的墙面是透明的，在外面能够清楚地看见她爬楼梯的滑稽样子，罗德斯太太和卡拉在草坪上——如果她们真的抬头张望塔楼——也许能看见她，还会彼此相视一笑，说：“那个玛格丽特呀，她最终还是爬到塔楼上去了。”然后笑着彼此点点头。

她还想往上爬，可楼梯到头了，眼前是一扇沉重的木门，玛格丽特站在房门下的最后一级台阶上，抬手敲了敲门。她觉得自己看上去更矮小了，甚至站在塔楼的顶端，她也并不是真的很高大。

“进来。”当玛格丽特第二次敲门时，里面传来了姑奶奶的声音。第一次敲门时，正如预料之中的一样无人应答，好像房间里有人用听不见的声音在说：“是有人在敲门吗？”然后，好像是在等着第二次敲门来确认——而玛格丽特的指关节现在还觉得生疼，因为这么厚的木门要想让里面听到敲门声可得使劲敲。她从下面笨手笨脚地开了门——这多容易呀，她心想，如果我知道这种方式的话——她走了进去，在四下张望之前，有礼貌地说道：“我是卡拉的朋友。他们说我可以到塔楼上来看看，当然如果您希望我走开的话，我就不打扰了。”她原来盘算过要把这段话说得更优雅得体些，听不出她没有得到楼下罗德斯一家人，邀请她来塔楼参观的暗示，但是爬了一段很长的楼梯，她有些上气不接下气了，不得不一股脑儿都说了，她确实也没有试探的时间了，尽管她为此曾仔细地思量过一番。

姑奶奶正坐在圆形房间的另一边，背靠着一扇窗户，所以看不大清楚她的面容。不管怎样，她说出的话却显得彬彬有礼——“我很吃惊他们竟然跟你谈到了我。但是，既然你已经来了，我就不能假装真的反感你的到访。你可以进来，坐下吧。”

玛格丽特顺从地走进了房间，像个粗鲁笨拙的人似的坐在了一条围着塔楼房间转了一圈的石凳上，四面的窗户的位置很高，而且都迎风开着，所以房间里持续不断地有风刮进来，使得说话得大声些，不费些力气都听不清说的是什么。

好像为了立即彰显她在这栋楼房中的重要地位，老妇人做了一个手势，开口笑着说：“我的挂毯。”然后对着窗户挥了挥手。如果老妇人的辈分是姑姑的话，那么她看起来太老了些；可如果是姑奶奶的话，她似乎又显得太年轻。她说话的声音在风声呼呼作响的塔楼房间里能够听得很清楚，窗户旁边的她看上去身体很好，向外望去好像根本不会头晕，爬上爬下楼梯也不会觉得劳累。

“我能看一下窗外吗？”玛格丽特问道。一只猫坐在她的身边，正盯着她看，眼中既没显出友好，但是也看不出什么反感。

“当然，”姑奶奶说道，“你当然可以看看窗外。”

玛格丽特在石凳上转过身子，用双手撑着窗户边宽大的石头窗台上向外看去，但是她失望了。虽然树顶还不到塔楼的一半高，但她只能看到下面的树枝和树叶，根本看不到宽阔的草坪、房子的屋顶，还有弯曲的河流。

“我真希望在这儿能看到河水流淌的踪迹。”

“河水并没从这儿流过。”老妇人说完，大笑了起来。

“我的意思是，”玛格丽特说道，“他们告诉我，这条河道形成了一条弧线，几乎围着这栋房子转了一个圈。”

“谁告诉你的？”老妇人说道。

“保罗。”

“我明白了，”老妇人说道，“他回来了，对吧？”

“他已经回来好几天了，可很快又要走了。”

“你叫什么名字？”老妇人探过身子问道。

“玛格丽特。”

“我明白了，”老妇人又说了一遍，“这也是我的名字。”她说道。

玛格丽特想，说“太好了”好像不是一个合适的回应，但说“真的吗？”，或者“简直想象不到”，或者“多巧呀”，又觉得这样可能显得更加愚蠢，所以她只是模棱两可地冲着老妇人笑了一下，打消了开口说“多可爱的名字呀”的念头。

“他应该早点儿回来，早点儿离开，”老妇人继续说道，好像又在自言自语，“那么我们把这些全都抛在身后吧。”

“把什么全都抛在身后？”玛格丽特问道，虽然她觉得自己和老妇人的聊天并没有真正在一个频道上，但是这个聊天似乎——可能是——老妇人在一个更大的主题上不断地自问自答，而无关玛格丽特名字的事。而玛格丽特作为一个闯入者，虽然年轻，但还是不能允许她长久地打断老妇人的思路。“把什么全都抛在身后？”玛格丽特执拗地问道。

“我是说，”老妇人转过身看着玛格丽特说道，“他回来的日子应该早一些，按往常的规律现在已经走了，我们所有人目前也都侥幸脱身了。”

“我明白了，”玛格丽特说道，“嗯，我认为他不会在这儿再待很长时间了。他说到要走了。”她说话的声音不由自主地有些颤抖。为了向老妇人证明她声音中的颤抖并非是真实的，玛格丽特用几乎是挑战的口吻说道：“他要是走了，这儿就不热闹了。”

“我们会侥幸脱身的，玛格丽特，你和我，”老妇人说道，“离窗户远点儿，孩子，否则你会被淋湿的。”

玛格丽特这时才意识到暴风雨一直——她现在刚觉察到——威胁着这栋房子，即使在大晴天，也可能随时突然铺天盖地倾泻下来，风刮得更紧了，透过塔楼的窗户的风带来了瓢泼大雨。猫的黑色皮毛上有了好些雨滴，玛格丽特也感觉到脸的一侧被雨打湿了。“窗户要不要关上？”她问道，“我是否能帮您……？”

“我不介意这场雨，”老妇人说道，“也不是第一次在塔楼的周围下这么大的雨了。”

“我也不介意，”玛格丽特急忙说道，抽身从窗户旁躲开了。她意识到自己正在与猫对视，紧张地补充道：“当然了，虽然身上弄湿会……”她迟疑了一下，看见那只猫毫无表情地盯着她。“我的意思是，”她过意不去地说，“有些人不喜欢身上被弄湿。”

那只猫从容不迫地转身背对着她，脸更加靠近窗户了。

“您要说关于保罗的什么事？”玛格丽特问老妇人，觉得一条有某种关系的细线正纠缠在老妇人、猫、塔楼和雨之间，甚至让玛格丽特有种恍然大悟的感觉，为什么自己早就想探查塔楼，可就是迟疑不决。“他很快就要走了，您知道。”

“如果现在就能结束，事情早就不会这样了，”老妇人说道，“这些事情不会真的费很大工夫的，你知道，依我看越早越好。”

“我想真是这样。”玛格丽特巧妙地说道。

“毕竟，”老妇人头发上沾满雨滴，做梦般地说道，“我们无法总能预见到要发生的事情。”

玛格丽特正在琢磨怎样礼貌地脱身，回到楼下把自己身上弄干，只有老妇人还在有一搭没一搭地谈论保罗，她打算不失礼节地告辞。而且，风雨不断地透过窗户抽打到玛格丽特身上，驱赶着客人，好像玛格丽特和老妇人，书和猫都要被风雨冲刷掉，然后把塔楼楼顶清理干净。

“如果可以的话，我会帮助你。”老妇人认真地对玛格丽特说道。她提高了声音，在风雨中听上去如同尖叫。她站起身向玛格丽特走来，玛格丽特觉得她颤颤巍巍快要摔倒了，忙伸出手想要搀扶她一下。猫站起来发出呼哧呼哧的声音，暴风雨从窗户处横扫过来，而玛格丽特，正握着老妇人的手，听到风声中夹杂着世界上的各种各样的声音，它们似乎都向她大喊着“再见，再见”，和“一切都失去了”，还有另一个声音“我会永远记住你”，还有别的呼喊，“太黑了。”她还听见从遥远的地方传来的一个声音，“回来，回来。”然后，老妇人把手从玛格丽特手中抽了出来，声音就都消失了。那只猫也退缩了，老妇人冷冷地看着玛格丽特说道：“正如我说的，如果可以的话，我会帮助你。”

“真对不起，”玛格丽特无力地说道，“我以为您要摔倒了。”

“再见。”老妇人说道。

在舞会上，玛格丽特穿着卡拉的蓝色蕾丝边薄礼服，头发上别着黄色的玫瑰花。她还从装满扇子的房间里得到了一把扇子，象牙制的扇骨看上去很坚固，因为她不小心把它弄掉了两次，扇骨竟然毫发无损。象牙扇骨上还优雅地画着这栋房子的微型画，扇子一收，房子也就不见了。扇子是罗德斯太太送给她的，卡拉也得到了一把，这样当玛格丽特和卡拉共舞时，在喝潘趣酒(2)或者在厅里见面时，她们都会快乐地问对方：“你的扇子还在吗？我把我的扇子借给了别人一会儿。我把我的扇子给每个人都看了。你还拿着你的扇子吗？我还拿着我的呢。”

玛格丽特既跟陌生人跳舞，也跟保罗跳了舞，而当她跟保罗跳舞时，他们远离了跳舞的人群，在挂着各种画的画廊里翩翩起舞，又在柱子间舞进舞出，这些柱子一直排列到大厅，大厅的一侧就是那间铺着特殊瓷砖的房间。他们身边跳舞的女士们有的身着深红色的丝质长裙，有的穿着绿色缎子礼服，还有的穿着白色的天鹅绒长袍；而罗德斯太太穿着黑色的舞会礼服，脖子上戴着钻石项链，手上也戴着钻石戒指，站在舞厅上方的走廊上，微笑地看着跳舞的人群，或者挽着罗德斯先生的胳膊和客人们打招呼。客人们从廊柱间笑声朗朗地进入舞厅，有的迫不及待地找着舞伴，有的在进来时已经随着音乐踩着节拍了。有的女士头发上插着白色的羽毛，波浪般的长发披在肩上；还有的女士在肩上披着粉色的围巾，当她起舞时，围巾在她身后随风舞动。保罗穿着笔挺的制服，而卡拉头发上别着红色的玫瑰正在和上尉共舞。

“你明天真的要走了吗？”在傍晚时，玛格丽特问保罗。虽然她知道他要走了，但还是忍不住又问这个问题——她以前已经问了好几次了——用它在他们之间建立某种联系，他有走的权利，她有想知道的权利，她的心头有某种酸酸的甜蜜。

“你是不是已经见过姑奶奶了。”保罗说道，他好像已经知道了答案。玛格丽特顺着他的目光，看见了塔楼中的老妇人。她穿着黄色的绸缎衣服，看上去有种君临天下和骄傲的神情，当她穿过跳舞的人群时，如果有人靠近她，她会拽着长裙闪到一边。她向玛格丽特和保罗走了过来，而这两人正坐在靠墙的小椅子上。当她走近他们时微笑着注视保罗，伸出她的双手，对他说道：“我很高兴见到你，我亲爱的。”

然后，她对玛格丽特笑了笑，玛格丽特也冲她微笑，心里暗自庆幸老妇人没有向她伸出双手。

“玛格丽特告诉我你回来了，”老妇人对保罗说道，“我下来是想见你一面。”

“我很高兴您想见我，”保罗说道，“我也很想见您，我差点儿去了塔楼。”

他们两个人都哈哈大笑了起来，而玛格丽特，一会儿看看这个，一会儿又看看那个，惊诧于两个人是那么相像。玛格丽特笔直僵硬地坐在狭窄的椅子上，蓝色的蕾丝长裙迷人地飘散在脚下，双手交叉，规矩地放在膝头，倾听着他们的谈话。保罗已经给老妇人拉过了一把椅子，他们坐在一起，头挨得很近，交谈时注视着对方，时不时地微笑着。

“你看上去身体很棒，”老妇人说道，“身体确实很好。”她叹了口气。

“您看上去也非常好呀。”保罗说道。

“哦，得了吧，”老妇人说道，“我上了年纪，年岁大了，我知道的。”

“我岁数也不小了。”保罗说道。

“一点儿也看不出来，”老妇人说道，摇着头，又认真地看了他有一分钟，“你绝不会老的，我认为。”

这时，上尉走了过来，在玛格丽特的面前鞠了一躬，玛格丽特希望保罗能注意到他们，她站起身准备和他一起跳舞。

“我看见你一个人坐在那里，”上尉说道，“我要抓住这个宝贵的机会，整个晚上我一直在等这个机会。”

“很好的战术，”玛格丽特说道，心想这些话他可能以前在不同的舞会上说过无数次了。

“我可是一名优秀的参谋，”上尉勇敢地说道，好像给出机智的回答是他义不容辞的任务，在那么多闪亮的枝状大吊灯下说出连珠妙语，“如果目标是我梦寐以求的。”

“我看见你是在和卡拉跳舞呀。”玛格丽特说道。

“卡拉。”他说道，同时还做了一个手势好像表明卡拉比玛格丽特差远了。玛格丽特亲眼看见他曾对卡拉也做过同样的手势，也许指的就是玛格丽特。她哈哈一笑。

“我忘了我现在想说什么了。”她告诉他。

“你是想说，”他一脸严肃地告诉她，“你们真的这么快就要走了吗？”

“你们真的这么快就要走了吗？”玛格丽特顺从地说道。

“为了尽早地回来。”他说道，搂着她腰部的手用了一下力。玛格丽特知道该她说话了，于是说道：“我们会特别想念你们的。”

“我会想你的。”他说道，用一种男人服从命令式的口吻。

他们一起跳了两支华尔兹，然后上尉很绅士地陪她回到了原先的座位上，保罗和老妇人还在旁边的椅子上交谈，笑声和手势不断。上尉向玛格丽特深鞠一躬，做了一个立正的姿势。

“我可以暂时离开一下吗？”他问道，“我觉得卡拉正在找我。”

“我在这儿很好。”玛格丽特说道。当上尉匆匆离开后，她又开始倾听保罗和老妇人的谈话了。

“我记得，我记得，”老妇人一边用扇子轻轻地拍着保罗的手腕，一边大笑着说，“我从未想到有一阵子我发现那很有意思。”

“确实好玩。”保罗说道。

“我们那时是那么年轻，”老妇人说道，“我都快忘了。”

她突然站了起来，朝着玛格丽特颔首作别，穿过跳舞的人群回到来时的房间。保罗一直跟着她走到门口，然后离开她回到玛格丽特身边。当他挨着她坐下时说道：“那么你和这个老妇人见过面了？”

“我去了塔楼。”玛格丽特说道。

“她告诉我了，”他心不在焉地说道，低头看着手套，“好了，”他最后一边用一种快乐的神情看着玛格丽特，一边说道，“他们永远不演奏华尔兹吗？”




第二天在太阳还没在河流上升起之前，他们已经坐在餐桌前吃早餐了，罗德斯夫妇坐在餐桌的两头，卡拉和上尉坐在一起，玛格丽特和保罗挨着。卡拉头上的红玫瑰已经褪色被扔掉了，玛格丽特的黄玫瑰也是同样的命运，但是卡拉和玛格丽特仍然穿着她们舞会时穿的礼服。她们穿着礼服有很长时间了，以至于很不方便的礼服穿在她们身上反而显得很自然了，似乎她们不打算换下来了，要在这栋房子里永远地穿下去。帮助彼此穿这套复杂的礼服时的乐趣，彼此赞赏着对方，捋直裙边的褶皱，让长裙摆动得更加优雅，这一切似乎是存留在记忆中很久以前的事了，也许是一个梦，根本就没有发生过。或许就像挂在餐厅墙上挂毯中的人物还秘密地记得一个想象中的穿衣过程，伴随着笑声和轻快的话语坐在草坪上，草坪上的他们都被织进了挂毯。玛格丽特看着卡拉，她看见卡拉穿着这身柔软的白色礼服，从没有过这么亲切熟悉之感，她的头发高高地盘在头顶——以前真的是这样拳曲着的吗？真的是这样盘着的吗？或者，一直都是那样的？——还有她手中的扇子——她以前难道没拿过那把扇子，就是如此这般地拿着吗？——当卡拉微微转动细长脖子上的头时，仿佛是长长画廊中某个肖像画的仪态。保罗和上尉穿着制服，依旧显得那么精神。他们在太阳升起时就要出发了。

“你们真的今天一大早就得走吗？”玛格丽特向保罗耳语道。

“你们都太好了，为了跟我们说再见，这么一大早就起来了。”上尉说道。他向前倾着身子看着玛格丽特前面的桌子，好像它代表着玛格丽特的情谊。

“每次我儿子离开我的时候，”罗德斯太太说道，“我都感觉他好像是第一次离开家。”

突然，上尉转向了罗德斯太太说道：“我今天早晨注意到，门前的草地有一块被踩得光秃秃的。还能给它复原吗？”

“我没发现呀。”罗德斯太太说道。她紧张地看了一眼罗德斯先生。罗德斯先生把手平静地放在桌上说道：“只要我们能力所及，我们希望这栋房子能处于良好的修缮状态。”

“但是湖边破败的雕像怎么办？”上尉说道，“还有挂毯上的裂口你也抛在脑后？”

“你注意到这些东西是不对的。”罗德斯太太柔声说道。

“那我能做些什么呢？”他对她说道，“不注意到这些事情是不可能的。比如鱼儿都快死了。还有，今年藤架上也看不见葡萄了。地毯都磨出了线，就跟您刺绣时第一层打底的样子差不多了，”他向罗德斯太太欠了欠身子，“还有这栋房子本身……”又冲罗德斯先生鞠了一躬，“暖房的窗户有着明显的裂纹，坚固的石墙也有了裂缝。您都能修缮吗？”

罗德斯先生没有什么底气似的说道：“你整天注意这些东西是不对的，你没注意到太阳吗，没有注意到客厅既明亮又完美吗？你最近没去挂满肖像的画廊吗？你没去草坪上的绿地散步吗，而只看到了那块光秃秃的地方？”

“客厅也破败不堪了，”上尉心平气和地说道，“绿色的凸花纹织锦面的沙发磨损得都快到扶手了，地毯已经失去了光泽。金色屋子里，四把小椅子上的镀金也有了缺口，银色屋子中的镀银之处也都剥落了。因爱而死的玛格丽特的脸上，有一块小瓷砖还不翼而飞了，而大画廊里的某个肖像画也有些褪色……”他再次向罗德斯先生弯了弯腰，“那是你曾曾祖父的肖像，先生。”

罗德斯先生和太太面面相觑，然后罗德斯太太说道：“因为这些事情指责我们肯定是没必要的吧？”

上尉满脸通红，摇了摇头。

“我的刺绣马上就完工了，”罗德斯太太说道，“我只需将人物再突出一下。”

“我将修补一下凸花纹织锦面的沙发。”卡拉说道。

上尉再一次环视了桌子边的每个人，然后叹了口气。“我得收拾行李了，”他说道，“即使在可爱的女士们面前失礼，我们也不能不按时归队。”罗德斯太太冷冷地扭过脸，起身离开了桌子，卡拉和玛格丽特也紧随其后。

玛格丽特快速地走到那间铺瓷砖的屋子，屋里因爱而死的玛格丽特白皙的脸上的眼睛，正永恒地凝视着大窗户外面远处的天空。在宽宽的白色面颊处，确实有一块瓷砖不见了，留下的破损点好像是一滴眼泪，玛格丽特暗自心想。她跪了下去，用手迅速地摸着瓷砖镶嵌的脸颊想确定那终归不是一滴泪珠。

接着她穿过好几个可爱的房间慢慢地走了回来。她穿过了宽阔的玫瑰红和白色瓷砖铺就的大厅，走进了客厅，然后停下脚步转身去关身后高大的房门。

“真的有块瓷砖不见了。”她说道。

保罗转过身，皱了皱眉。他一个人站在客厅里，穿着制服，显得高大精神，正准备离开。“你弄错了，”他说道，“不可能有东西不见的。”

“我亲眼看见的。”

“那不是真的，你知道。”他说道。他在房间里快速地走来走去，用手套轻轻抽着手腕，时不时很紧张地瞄着房门，瞄着高高在上的大开的窗户，窗户外面是大理石楼梯。“这栋楼房与以前一样，”他说道，“没有改变。”

“但是磨损得很厉害的地毯……”当他踱步的时候，地毯就在他的脚下。

“胡说，”他暴跳如雷地说道，“你认为我还不知道我自己家的房子吗？我不断地料理它，甚至他们都忘了。没有这栋房子，我就无法存活。你以为当我还在这儿的时候，它就开始崩溃了吗？”

“你怎么能不让它老化呢？地毯会磨损，你知道，除非它们被更换……”

“更换？”他瞪大眼睛，好像她说了什么邪恶的事情，“这栋房子里什么能被更换？”他轻轻地抚摩着罗德斯太太未完工的刺绣，“我们所能做的只是添针加线增补它。”

外面传来一阵嘈杂声，全家人从楼梯上下来打算跟他们道别。他敏捷地转过身，倾听着，好像那是他一直在期盼的声音。“我会永远记住你的，”他对玛格丽特匆匆说道，然后又转向高高的窗户，“再见。”

“天还那么黑，”玛格丽特在他身边走着，说道，“你还会回来吗？”

“我会回来的，”他尖声说道，“再见。”他迈过窗台，跳到外面的大理石楼梯上。在白色大理石的映衬下，他像一团黑影，玛格丽特静静地站在窗户边目送着他走下台阶，穿过花园。“失去了，失去了，”她听见从远处传来的微弱的声音，“一切都失去了。”

她转身回到了房间，避免走在地毯上磨损的地方，远远地绕过罗德斯太太正在制作的刺绣。她走到门厅大门处，打开了门。外面，在玫瑰红和白色瓷砖铺就的大厅里，罗德斯先生、罗德斯太太，以及卡拉，正和上尉站在一起。

“儿子，”罗德斯太太正在说，“你什么时候再回来？”

“不要烦我，”上尉说道，“我能回来时自然会回来。”

卡拉安静地站在一边。“请多保重，”她又说道，“这是玛格丽特，她是过来跟你说再见的，哥哥。”

“别再耽搁了，我的儿子，”罗德斯先生说道，“女人们就是婆婆妈妈的。”

“你在家时，我和玛格丽特为你计划了好多事情，”卡拉对她哥哥说道，“可时间太短了。”

玛格丽特站在罗德斯太太身边，对着卡拉的哥哥（是保罗吗，谁又是保罗？）说道：“再见。”他向她鞠躬致意，和他父亲一起走向大门。

“看见他走太难受了，”罗德斯太太说道，“我们不知道他什么时候才能回来。”她把手温柔地搭在玛格丽特的肩上。“我们必须领你参观一下这栋房子更多的地方，”她说道，“我看见你有一天想打开那个破败塔楼的门来着。你参观过充满鲜花的门厅吗？或者那个有喷泉的房间？”

“当我哥哥再次回来时，”卡拉说道，“我们会在晚上办个音乐会，也许他会带着我们在河上划船呢。”

“那我的参观计划呢？”玛格丽特笑着说道，“我的参观肯定要泡汤了吧？”

罗德斯太太最后看了一眼大门，罗德斯先生和上尉已经从门口消失了，她的手从玛格丽特的肩上挪了下来，说道：“我必须忙我的刺绣去了，我儿子在家的这几天我都没动它。”

“在我哥哥再次回来之前，你不会离开我们吧？”卡拉问玛格丽特。

“我只需把人物更加突出，”罗德斯太太一边说着，一边迟疑着向客厅走去。“如果你们坐在河边的草坪上，我会把你们原封不动地刺绣下来。”

“我们是不能动的模特，”卡拉大笑着说道，“玛格丽特，你愿意来草坪上坐在我的旁边吗？”

口袋里有花生的普通一天


约翰·菲利普·约翰逊先生关上了身后的前门，走下了门前的台阶。在这个阳光明媚的上午，他的心情很好，感觉在这美好的日子里，世界上的一切也同样美好。难道太阳不是温暖和灿烂的吗？新换了鞋底的一双鞋穿着难道不是格外舒服吗？他知道自己无疑选了一条最适合今天戴的领带，无论如何，阳光和舒服的双脚告诉自己，这个世界难道不是一个奇妙的地方吗？尽管他的个头不高，虽然领带或许太过色彩艳丽，但是当约翰逊先生走下台阶，来到脏兮兮的人行道上时，他的身上洋溢着幸福，对路过他身边的每个人都微笑，甚至也有些人以微笑来回报。他在街角的报亭停了下来，买了份报纸，对着卖报的人真诚地问候“早安”。两三个等着买报纸的人幸运地跳过了约翰逊先生跟他们一一问候的程序。他记着在出门前往兜里装满了糖果和花生，并且打算自己徒步去市郊。他在一家花店停了下来，买了一枝康乃馨别在扣眼上，但没走出多远，就把这枝康乃馨送给了婴儿车上的一个小孩，小孩呆呆地看着他，然后笑了，约翰逊先生也冲他微笑，而小孩的妈妈注视了约翰逊先生一会儿，也微笑了起来。

约翰逊先生往市郊方向走了几个街区，穿过马路，随便选了一条小道走。他没有按照每天早上都走的路线行走，而是宁愿选择七拐八拐，但还算宽阔的道路在走，走路的姿势更像一个愣头青而不像行事稳妥的成年人。今天上午，在街区半截的地方，停着一辆正在搬家的货车，家具从楼上的公寓中搬出，一半放在了人行道上，另一半摆在了台阶上。一群闲着没事干的人，逗乐似的检查着桌子上的划痕和椅子上磕碰的地方。而一位疲惫烦乱的妇女，一边得设法照看年幼的孩子，一边还得一直留意着搬运工和家具。她的行动清楚地表明，在众人盯着她的东西看的时候，她竭力地想保护她的私人生活。约翰逊先生停下了脚步，也加入了看热闹的人群。过了一会儿，他走上前，礼貌地用手碰了碰帽檐，说道：“也许我能为您照看一下您的小孩，可以吗？”

妇女转过身来，不信任地盯着他看了一会儿。约翰逊先生急忙补充道：“我们就坐在这儿，在台阶上。”他召唤着小男孩，小男孩虽然迟疑了一下，但在约翰逊先生亲切微笑的感召下，最终还是同意了。约翰逊先生从口袋里掏出了一把花生，和小男孩一起坐到了台阶上。小男孩一开始拒绝吃花生，因为他妈妈不允许他接受陌生人的食品。约翰逊先生解释说，也许他妈妈说的食品并不包含花生，因为马戏团里的那些大象就吃观众给的花生，小男孩认真地考虑了一下，然后一本正经地同意了。他们坐在台阶上用一种默契的方式剥着花生，约翰逊先生问道：“这么说，你们要搬家？”

“是的。”小男孩回答道。

“搬哪儿去？”

“佛蒙特州。”

“挺不错的地方，那儿冬天的雪很大，枫叶糖也很不错，你喜欢吃枫叶糖吗？”

“当然。”

“佛蒙特州有很多枫叶糖。你要住在一个农场里吗？”

“我们要和姥爷一家住在一起。”

“姥爷喜欢花生吗？”

“当然。”

“那你也应该给他带点儿回去，”约翰逊先生边说边把手伸进了兜里，“只有你和妈妈去吗？”

“是的。”

“我跟你说，”约翰逊先生说道，“你拿点儿花生在火车上吃吧。”

小男孩的妈妈一开始每过一会儿就要瞄上他们几眼，这个时候她似乎觉得约翰逊先生是可以信赖的，因为她已经把全部心思都放在了监督工人搬家上——虽然搬家工人不会，或者说几乎不会损坏价格不菲的桌子的腿，或者把厨房的椅子压到台灯上，但是只要是家庭主妇就会对他们不放心。现在大多数的家具已经装车了，而这位妇女还在紧张地忙碌着，她发现有些东西忘记打包了——这些东西放在柜橱后面隐蔽的角落里，或者落在邻居家忘拿了，或者还挂在晒衣绳上——她正努力地回忆到底是什么东西。

“就这么多了吧，女士？”搬家工人的头问道，算是把她的沮丧完全消除了。

她不太肯定地点了点头。

“想待在卡车上和这些家具一起吗，小家伙？”搬家工人笑着问小男孩，小男孩也笑了起来，对约翰逊先生说：“我想在佛蒙特州我会过得开心的。”

“肯定会开心，”约翰逊先生站起身来说道，“走之前再多拿点儿花生吧。”他对小男孩说。

小男孩的妈妈对约翰逊先生说道：“太谢谢您了，真是帮了我大忙。”

“没什么，”约翰逊先生又殷勤地问道，“您打算去佛蒙特州的什么地方？”

这位妈妈嗔怪地看着小男孩，好像他泄露了什么重要的秘密似的。她不太情愿地说道：“格林威奇。”

“很不错的小城。”约翰逊先生说道。他又拿出了一张卡片，在背面写上了一个名字：“我的一个好朋友就住在格林威奇，”他说道，“有事可以找他。他太太做的炸面圈是城里最棒的。”他又一脸认真地跟小男孩补充道。

“太好了。”小男孩喊道。

“再见。”约翰逊先生说道。

他继续上路了，穿着新鞋，步伐轻快，感觉太阳暖暖地照在背上和头顶。他在这条街区的半路上又碰见了一条灰狗，也喂了它一粒花生。

在街区一角，他面对的又是一条宽阔的大街。他决定再次往市郊方向走，他相对懒散地慢慢向前挪动着脚步，从他身边匆匆走过的人都眉头紧锁，他们摩肩接踵地在他身边向相反的方向挤过，蹬蹬地向某处快速奔去。约翰逊先生在每个路口都停下来，耐心地等着交通灯变绿，如果看到某人似乎特别匆忙，他会侧身让路。但是，他弯腰抚摸便道上的一只小猫时——这只小猫从公寓楼里跑出来，如今无法穿过拥挤的人潮再回到家了——一位年轻的女士因为走得太快，猛地把他撞倒了。

“对不起，”年轻的女士说道，慌忙地想把约翰逊先生拉起来，同时又匆忙地想继续赶路，“实在对不起。”

小猫顾不上眼前被踩踏的危险了，飞也似的跑回了家中。“完全没关系，”约翰逊先生仔细地整理了一下衣服，说道，“您看上去很着急呀。”

“我当然着急了，”年轻的女士说道，“我要迟到了。”

她很懊恼，双目之间紧锁的眉头可能经常不舒展，似乎愁眉苦脸成了常态。她显然是起晚了，因为她没有多余的时间化妆，好让自己看上去漂亮些。她的衣服简单朴素，既没有衣领也没戴胸针，口红也明显涂得歪歪扭扭。她想从约翰逊先生旁边挤过去，但约翰逊先生冒着可能会让她以为他图谋不轨的风险，抓住了她的胳膊，说道：“请等一下。”

“听着，”她心里咯噔了一下，赶忙说道，“我是撞到了您，您的律师可以去见我的律师，我乐意赔偿您的一切损失，以及由此造成的其他不便，但是这会儿请您让我走，因为我要迟到了。”

“您干什么要迟到了？”约翰逊先生问道，他对她微笑着，想赢得她的信任，但是这似乎不能留住她，他担心她在挣脱中会再次把他撞倒。

“我上班要迟到了，”她从牙缝里挤出这句话，“上班迟到了，我有份工作，如果我迟到了，一小时会扣很多钱，而且我真的负担不起跟您愉快地聊天所带来的成本，无论跟您聊天是多么令人愉快。”

“我付给您钱。”约翰逊先生说道。这是些神奇的字眼，其实，并不是因为这是句实话，或者因为她真的指望约翰逊先生能付她钱，而是因为约翰逊先生朴实的话语，显然没有带丝毫讽刺的意味。当然，从约翰逊先生嘴里说出的话不可能有别的意思，因为他是个负责、真实、值得尊敬的人。

“您什么意思？”她问道。

“我是说，我显然对您的迟到负有责任，我理所应当赔偿您的损失。”

“您别犯傻了，”她说道，她紧锁的眉头第一次舒展开了，“我没指望您赔偿任何东西——不管怎么说，几分钟前，还是我提出来要赔偿您。”她又补充道，几乎是微笑着说的，“是我的错呀。”

“如果您不去上班的话，会去做些什么事？”

她睁大了眼睛，“那我就拿不到薪水了。”

“一点儿也没错。”约翰逊先生说道。

“您说的一点儿也没错是什么意思呀？确切地说如果二十分钟前我没有在办公室里出现的话，我一小时就会被扣掉一美元二十美分，或者说，一分钟两美分，或者”——她心想——“在我跟你说话的工夫，几乎损失了十美分了。”

约翰逊先生哈哈大笑了起来，后来她也开口笑了。“既然您已经迟到了，”他指明了这一点，“您愿意再跟我聊四美分的天吗？”

“我不明白您这是为什么。”

“您会明白的。”约翰逊先生信誓旦旦地说道。他领着她走到人行道的一边，紧靠着大楼，然后说，“站在这儿，”随即就走向两边分流的人群中了。他挑选和考量着，就像一个人对整个人生规划要做出选择一样，他评估着匆匆而过的人群。有一次，他几乎要采取行动了，但在仔细衡量之后，最后一刻又退了回来。终于，在距离有半个街区远的地方，他发现了想要的目标，动身走到了人流当中，拦住了一位正急匆匆赶路的年轻小伙子。他衣衫不整，好像起晚了，同样皱着眉头。

“哎哟，”年轻人喊道，因为约翰逊先生没有想出什么更好的办法来拦住他，只好如法炮制地用刚才那位年轻女士用在他身上的莽撞方法。“你到底要去哪儿呀？”年轻的小伙子在人行道上问道。

“我想跟你谈谈。”约翰逊先生坏坏地说道。

年轻人紧张地从地上站起来，掸了掸身上的土，看着约翰逊先生，“谈什么？”他问道，“我干什么了？”

“那就是最困扰我的关于当下人们的状态的问题，”约翰逊先生对着路过的人群抱怨着，“无论他们已经做了某事或者还没有做事，他们总是认为别人在追赶他们。我们来谈谈你要去干什么。”他告诉年轻人。

“听着，”年轻人说道，想从他身边挤过去，“我已经迟到了，没时间听你唠叨，给你十美分，赶紧走吧。”

“谢谢！”约翰逊先生说道，把硬币装到了口袋里。“听我说，”他说道，“如果你停止奔跑，会发生什么事吗？”

“我都迟到了，”年轻人一边说，一边想从缠着他的约翰逊先生的身边走开。

“你一个小时挣多少钱？”约翰逊先生问道。

“你是一个共产主义者吧？”年轻人说道，“现在请你让我……”

“不行，”约翰逊先生坚持道，“多少钱？”

“五十美元，”年轻人说道，“现在你可以……”

“你喜欢冒险吗？”

年轻人刚才就有些吃惊地盯着他，现在更是目瞪口呆了，他发现自己被约翰逊先生亲切的微笑所吸引而呆立在那儿了。他几乎都要还以微笑了，但是克制住了，再次努力想从约翰逊身边挤过去。“我赶时间。”他说道。

“你喜欢神秘的事吗？你喜欢出人意料的事吗？不同寻常和激动人心的事呢？”

“你在推销什么东西吧？”

“当然，”约翰逊先生说道，“你想试试运气吗？”

年轻人犹豫着，眼巴巴地望着街道，这条街道可能通向他的目的地。这时，约翰逊先生又开口了，用他那独特而不容置疑的口吻说“我来买单”后，小伙子转过身，勉强地说：“那好吧，但我先得看看，我要买的是什么东西。”

约翰逊先生使劲呼了口气，把年轻人领到了女孩站立的人行道边上。女孩一直在饶有兴致地观察约翰逊先生“捕捉”那位年轻小伙子的整个过程，而现在，她羞怯地微笑着，看着约翰逊先生，好像无论他再做什么，她都不再感到吃惊一样。

约翰逊先生把手伸进口袋，掏出了他的钱包，“给你，”他边说边把一张钞票递给了女孩，“这大致相当于你一天的薪水。”

“可是，这不行，”她说道，尽管她自己吃了一惊，“我的意思是，我不能接受。”

“请不要打断我，”约翰逊先生对姑娘说道。“这个给你，”他又对年轻小伙说道，“这个能解决你的问题。”年轻人恍恍惚惚地接过了钞票，可嘴上却不留神溜出这样一句话，“这也许是假钞吧。”“现在，告诉我，”约翰逊先生对年轻的女孩继续说道，根本没理会年轻小伙子的话，“你叫什么名字，小姐？”

“肯特，”她不知所措地说道，“米尔德里德·肯特。”

“好的。”约翰逊先生又问。“那你呢，先生？”

“亚瑟·亚当斯。”年轻小伙子舌头僵硬地说道。

“好极了。”约翰逊先生说道。“现在，肯特小姐，我想让你认识一下亚当斯先生。这位是亚当斯先生，这位是肯特小姐。”

肯特小姐瞪大了眼睛，紧张地舔了舔嘴唇，做了一个手势，仿佛拔脚要跑，然后招呼道：“您好！”

“现在，这个，”约翰逊先生边说，边从钱包里又抽出几张钞票，“对你们俩来说，今天应该足够了。我建议，也许是康尼岛——虽然我个人并不怎么喜欢那地方——或者是能享受一顿美妙午餐的地方，还可以去跳舞，或者观赏剧院的午后演出，甚至是一场电影。呃，费点儿心思，但要选一个真正的好电影，现在的烂片实在是太多了。你们俩还可以，”他说道，好像突然有了灵感，“去布朗克斯动物园，或者去天文馆。实际上，不管什么地方，”他总结道，“任何你们想去的地方，去度过一段快乐时光。”

当他打算离开的时候，亚瑟·亚当斯好像才从目瞪口呆中缓过神来，说道：“但是，你瞧，先生，你不能这么做。为什么——你怎么能知道——我的意思是，我们甚至都不认识——我的意思是，你怎么能知道我们不会只拿了你的钱，而不按你说的做呢？”

“你已经拿了钱，”约翰逊先生说道，“你不必听我的任何建议。你可能对你喜欢干的事情心中有数了——也许是一座博物馆，或者其他的什么东西。”

“可假如我揣着钱跑了，而把她甩在这儿呢？”

“我知道你不会的，”约翰逊先生温和地说道，“因为你还能想起来问我这个问题，再见。”他补充道，然后转身走了。

当他抬腿走在街道上的时候，察觉到了太阳升到了头顶，脚上的这双鞋也真是合脚。他听到身后某个地方传来年轻小伙子的说话声，“听着，如果你不想这么做，你知道你可以不必做，”而女孩的声音也很清晰，“除非你不想……”约翰逊先生笑了笑，觉得他最好还是加快点儿脚步。当他想这样的时候，他能走得很快。女孩说道：“好的，如果你愿意，我也愿意。”当女孩这句话说出口的时候，约翰逊先生已经走出了好几个街区，中间还停下了两次，一次是帮一位女士搬几个大包裹放进出租车，还有一次是喂一只海鸥吃花生。这时，他已经来到了一个商业区，这里有很多人。他不断地被人们挤来挤去，身边的行人行色匆匆，有的人穿过马路，有的人要迟到了，还有的人阴沉着脸。他给了一个伸手管他要一角硬币的人一粒花生，还给了一位公交车司机一粒花生。当时这位司机在一个交叉路口停下了公交车，打开了他座位旁边的玻璃窗，把头伸了出去，好像渴望呼吸新鲜的空气和享受相对安静的交通环境。那个想要一角硬币的男人接受了花生是因为约翰逊先生是用一美元的钞票包着花生的，而公交车司机接受了花生，调侃地问道：“你想要换乘吗，杰克？”

在一个人来人往的路口，约翰逊先生遇见了两个年轻人——片刻之间，他以为他们是米尔德里德·肯特和亚瑟·亚当斯呢——他们在急切地翻看着一张报纸。他们后背紧靠着一家商店的外墙来躲避熙熙攘攘的人流，他们的头挨在一起，低头浏览着报纸。约翰逊先生的好奇心永远得不到满足，他把身子也向店面靠过去，凑近他们，目光从那个年轻男人的肩头探过去，发现他们正在报纸上找空房出租专栏的信息。

约翰逊先生想起了刚才在街上遇到的那位正要搬家去佛蒙特州的妇女和她的小儿子。于是，他拍了拍那个年轻男人的肩膀，和蔼可亲地说道：“试试西区十七号楼。大约就在这条街区的中间位置，今天上午有人在搬家。”

“嗯，你要干什么……”男人说道，当看清了约翰逊先生以后，又赶紧说道，“哦，谢谢！你说的是哪儿？”

“西区十七号楼，”约翰逊先生说道，“大约就在这条街区的中间位置。”他微笑着说道，“祝你好运！”

“谢谢！”男人说道。

“谢谢！”他们俩离开的时候，女孩同样表达了感激之情。

“再见。”约翰逊先生说道。

他一个人在一家很不错的餐馆里吃了顿午餐，这家餐馆的食物很丰富。也只有约翰逊先生这么好的胃口才能吃得下两个由生奶油、巧克力、朗姆酒混合在一起做出的作为餐后甜点的点心，他还喝了三杯咖啡。给了侍者一笔不菲的小费后，他从餐馆中出来又回到了街上，再次沐浴在灿烂的阳光之下，脚上的这双鞋依然舒服与崭新。在餐馆的外面，他看见一个乞丐盯着他刚才就餐的餐馆的窗户，于是仔细地数了一遍兜里的钱，走到乞丐的面前，把一些硬币和几张钞票塞到了乞丐的手上。“这些钱够你吃一顿小牛排外加小费，”约翰逊先生说道，“再见。”

吃完午餐之后，他想休息一下。他漫步到了最近的一家公园里，用花生喂了鸽子。已经是下午比较晚的时候了，他打算往回走。在此之前，他还给两局棋盘游戏当了裁判，照看一个小男孩和一个小女孩，他们的母亲睡着了，当她醒来时，又吃惊又后怕。可她看见约翰逊先生正在帮她照看孩子时，惊恐之情变成了开心和好奇。他几乎把所有的糖果都发了出去，把剩下的花生也都喂了鸽子。是该回家的时候了，虽然下午四五点钟的太阳让人觉得愉快，脚上的鞋依然让人觉得非常舒服，但他还是决定打一辆出租车回市区。

打出租车时他遇到了点儿麻烦，因为他把头三辆或四辆空车让给了那些似乎更需要它们的人。然而，最后当他孤零零站在了街角时——差不多就像网中活蹦乱跳的鱼——近乎绝望地向过往的出租车高呼，终于成功地拦下了一辆正往市郊疾驰的出租车，车子好像很不情愿地在约翰逊先生面前停下。

当约翰逊先生钻进车里的时候，出租车司机对他说道：“先生，我觉得您好像是一个兆头，其实我刚才压根没打算拉您。”

“你真好。”约翰逊先生含糊不清地说道。

“可如果我不拉您，我可能会花掉十美元。”司机说道。

“真的吗？”约翰逊先生问道。

“是的，”司机说道，“有个家伙刚下车，他转身给了我这十美元，还说拿着这十美元赶紧去押一匹名叫‘伏尔甘(1)’的赛马，马上就能中奖。”

“伏尔甘？”约翰逊先生大惊失色地说道，“某个周三的火警信号？”

“什么？”司机说道，“不管怎样，我对自己说，如果在从这里到那里的路上我拉不上客人，我就拿这十美元去赌马，但是如果有人看上去要打我这辆车的话，我就把它看作一个兆头，我就会把这十美元带回家交给我老婆。”

“你很明智，”约翰逊先生真心实意地说，“这次赌马是在周三，你会破财的。周一可以，甚至周六去赌马也没问题。但是千万不要在周三去惹火上身。现在来看，周日赌马应该不错。”

“伏尔甘在周日不出赛。”司机说道。

“你可以等个别的日子，”约翰逊先生说道，“请你开到下面那条街吧，师傅。我在下一个街角那儿下车。”

“但是，他告诉我要买伏尔甘呀。”司机说道。

“你听我说，”出租车的车门打开一半时，约翰逊先生犹豫了一下，还是说道，“你挣了那十美元，我再给你十美元，你可以直接去买赌马彩票，把钱押在任何一个周四出场的任何一匹赛马上，马的名字应该是……让我想想，周四……，有了，叫‘谷子’或者任何跟生长的食物有关的名字。”

“谷子？”司机说道，“您的意思是说马的名字，比如像‘小麦’一类？”

“当然，”约翰逊先生说道，“或者，实际上，干脆简单点儿说吧，任何一匹名字中包含C、R、L三个字母的赛马，这样说你就明白了。”

“高玉米(2)吗？”司机说道，眼睛里开始闪光，“您是说马的名字，比如高玉米？”

“太对了，”约翰逊先生说道，“给你钱。”

“高玉米，”司机还在自言自语，“谢谢您，先生。”

“再见。”约翰逊先生说道。

他到了自己住的街区，直接向自己住的公寓走去。进了家门后，他喊道：“有人吗？”约翰逊太太应声从厨房里答道：“喂，亲爱的，今天回来得早了点儿？”

“打出租车回来的，”约翰逊先生说道，“我也还惦记着奶酪蛋糕呢。晚饭吃什么呀？”

约翰逊太太从厨房里走出来，亲吻了他一下。她是位随和的家庭主妇，当约翰逊先生向她微笑的时候，她也报以微笑。“今天挺累吗？”她问道。

“倒不是很累，”约翰逊先生一边说着，一边把外套挂到橱柜中，“你怎么样呀？”

“凑合吧。”她站在离厨房不远的门廊上说道。他坐在安乐椅上，脱下了他那双好鞋，拿出他上午买的那份报纸。“你总是把东西到处乱放。”她说道。

“我做得还不错，”约翰逊先生说道，“凑成了一对年轻人。”

“不错，”她说道，“我下午打了个盹，大多数时候都很放松。上午去了趟百货商店，我身边的一个女人正在偷东西，我告发了她，让商店的保安把她抓走了。把三条狗送到狗笼里……你知道，都是些平常的琐事。哦，对了，还有一件事。”她像又想起了什么，补充道。

“什么事？”约翰逊先生问道。

“呃，”她说道，“我上了一辆公交车，告诉司机要换乘，可他先帮了别人，我说他真是无礼，和他吵了一架。然后我又说，他干吗不入伍，肯定在逃兵役，我说得很大声，其他人都听见了。我把他的工作证号码记下来了，我投诉了他，他可能会因此丢了饭碗。”

“好吧，”约翰逊先生说道，“可是你看上去确实很累。明天想调整一下吗？”

“我也想，”她说道，“我可能会调整一下。”

“好，”约翰逊先生说道，“晚饭吃什么？”

“小牛排。”

“我午餐吃的就是这个。”约翰逊先生说道。

露易莎，请回家吧


“露易莎。”收音机里传来我母亲的声音，让我的心揪紧了好一阵子。“露易莎，”她呼唤道，“请回家吧，你已经离家三年了，我向你保证一切都会好起来的。我们大家都很挂念你，我们想让你回来，露易莎，请回家吧！”

又一年了，在我离家出走的周年的纪念日，每次听到母亲的呼唤都会让我心惊肉跳。因为年复一年，我怕我会渐渐忘记母亲的声音，那听上去柔和的声音会变成陌生的恳求，而这种恳求声我每年都会听到。我在报纸上也读到了这些报道，“露易莎·泰瑟尔一年前失踪”，随后，报道中的一年变成两年，两年变成三年，我年年都会等着六月二十日的到来，如同那天是我的生日一样。刚开始时，我把报纸上有关我的报道都剪下来偷偷地保存着，如果有人看见我正在剪头版带有我照片的报纸，一定会觉得这个人怪怪的。钱德勒市，我的藏身之所，离我的老家并不远，所以当地的报纸对我失踪的报道连篇累牍，小题大做。当然，我之所以把钱德勒市作为我藏身的首选地是因为这座城市足够大，容易藏身。

你知道，我可不是心血来潮才做出这个决定的，我知道自己迟早会离家出走，也已经提前筹划很长时间了，只是在等待合适的时机罢了。起初每一步都经过了精心算计，因为这种事通常不会给你第二次机会。如果当初事情败露了，我不但会让自己看上去像个大傻瓜，而且我的姐姐卡罗尔也绝不会轻饶了我，因为我愚弄了包括她在内的所有人。我得承认我是故意选择在她婚礼的前一天离家出走的，后来过了好长时间，我还会常常试想卡罗尔的脸色是多么的难看，因为她意识到我的出走最后会导致她的婚礼少一个伴娘。报纸上说他们还是按计划举行了婚礼，卡罗尔告诉一家报社的记者，她的妹妹露易莎本来是想参加她的婚礼来着。“她绝不会想着要破坏我的婚礼。”卡罗尔说。然而，她心里明白我确实就是想着要给她添堵的。我真的敢肯定当他们知道我失踪了，卡罗尔做的第一件事情就是跑去赶紧清点婚礼的礼物，看看我是不是偷着带走了什么东西。

不管怎么说，卡罗尔的婚礼可能被我搞砸了，但我的计划进展顺利，说实话，出乎我意料的顺利。大家都在房前屋后跑来跑去地为婚礼做着准备，摆放花朵，互相询问婚纱是否已经送来，把盛香槟酒的箱子打开，而且考虑到如果下雨，不能使用花园了，他们应该有什么样的预案。我只需悄悄溜出前门，匆匆离开即可。我只遇到了一小点儿麻烦，保罗看见了我。保罗一直住在我们家隔壁，卡罗尔讨厌他远远超过了讨厌我，我母亲过去也常说，但凡我做了什么让家人蒙羞的坏事，保罗一定会牵涉其中。有很长一段时间，他们认为我的离家出走，他肯定脱不了干系，甚至让他一遍遍地解释，那天下午在行车道上碰见我时，我是怎样千方百计地想躲着他走。报纸上也一直称他为“这家人的密友”，这一报道让我母亲大喜过望，因为这就意味着他正被警察传讯，这样就有可能找到我失踪的线索。当然，他绝不知道我究竟去了哪里。在我出走之前，我跟他说的话和对我母亲说的一样——家里太乱，我想清静一会儿，去趟城里的商业区逛逛。也许随便买个三明治当作晚餐，再去看场电影。他在那儿缠了我半天，很显然也想跟我一块儿去。我原本没打算坐那趟就停在街角的公交车，但保罗像个跟屁虫似的在我身后，想让我等他一会儿，他去开车，我们一起开车出去并且在小酒馆共进晚餐。在这头一件事发生的时候，我不得不加快脚步，紧跑几步赶上了公交车，把他甩在了后面。这也是我原计划唯一改变的部分。

我坐着这辆开往市中心的公交车，虽然我最初的计划是走一段路，可事实证明坐公交车反而歪打正着，因为即使有人看见我坐在开往我们自己市中心的公交车上也很正常，而我还能设法赶上更早的一班火车离开家乡。我买了一张往返票，这很重要，因为这样才会让他们以为我很快就会回来，这是他们考虑事情的思维定式——如果你做了某件事，那一定是有原因的。因为我的父母还有卡罗尔绝不会做某事，除非他们有足够的理由，所以如果我买了一张往返票的话，唯一有可能的理由就是我还打算回来。而且，如果他们想到我很快就会回来，就不会马上担心害怕，我就有可能在他们寻找我之前有更多的时间躲藏起来了。但是，后来发生了一件事，让我觉得人算不如天算。在当天晚上，因为卡罗尔睡不着觉，她去我的房间里找阿司匹林，结果发现我不见了踪影。

我当然知道他们会发现我买了火车票。我还不至于蠢到以为自己能偷偷溜走而不留下任何蛛丝马迹。我所有的计划都基于这样一种事实：凡是被逮着的人都是一些引起了人们关注的人，他们要么做了稀奇古怪的事情，要么做了引人注目的事情，而我一直盘算的计划是尽量低调，让人们看不清我的来路。我知道他们会发现那张往返票，因为在他们生活了一辈子的城镇上，这是一件奇怪的事情，但这也是我做的最后一件非同寻常的事情。我想当我买这张票时，心里很清楚往返票对我的父母来说可能是某种安慰。他们也许会想，不管我离家有多久，至少我手里还有一张回家的车票。实际上，我也的确保存这张往返票有相当长的一段时间了，我甚至常常把它放到随身带的钱包里当作幸运符。

我密切注意着报纸上的每一条消息，每天早上在我上班之前，我通常会和皮库克太太一边喝着第二杯咖啡，一边在早餐桌上读着报纸。

“对于那个在洛克维尔市失踪的女孩，你有什么看法？”皮库克太太这样问我。我故作难过状地摇了摇头，表示一个女孩要像那样离开漂亮舒适的家一定是脑子不正常了，当然还有另外一种可能，也许她压根就没离开家——可能家人把她锁在了某处，因为她患有杀人偏执症。皮库克太太对杀人偏执症一类的事情总是很感兴趣。

有一次，我拿起报纸，看着报上的照片。“您不认为她长得很像我吗？”我问皮库克太太。她坐直身子，看看我，又看看照片，再次把目光落在我身上，最后摇了摇头说：“不像，要是你的头发再长一些，更拳曲一些就像了，你的脸要更圆一些，才多少有点儿像。但如果你看上去像一个杀人偏执狂的话，我才不会让你进我的门呢。”

“我觉得她长得挺像我。”我说道。

“你该去上班了，少在这儿扯这些没用的了。”皮库克太太跟我说道。

当然，当我揣着往返票坐上火车的时候，我不知道过多长时间他们会到处找我，我就当一切顺利，因为如果不这样想的话，那会让我紧张，我就会做错事，从而把事情搞砸。我知道一旦他们打消了我会用往返票重新回到洛克维尔市的盼头的话，他们首先会想到我可能去了克雷恩市，那是这趟火车能到达的最大的城市，其实我只在那儿停留了大半天。我去了一家大百货商场，那儿正在搞全场大促销活动。我料想我会身处在一大群购物者中，果然不出所料。如果我没有从家里出走，我在克雷恩市百货商场一楼闲逛的那段时间就不会碰上那么好的运气了。我在人群中费劲地挤着，终于来到了一个正在促销雨衣的柜台前，我左推右搡，从一个老怪物的手中夺过了我想要的雨衣，反正她那种肥胖的体形根本穿不进去，你要是知道她都已经付过钱了，就能想象得出她大喊大叫的样子。我的聪明之处在于我递给售货员的钱正好是六美元八十九美分，不多不少，正好是雨衣的价钱。交完钱我一把抢过雨衣和她正想装雨衣的袋子，在我被挤扁之前又一次拼命挤了出来。

那件雨衣对于六美元八十九美分的价钱来说绝对超值，那年我一直穿着它，直到冬天，甚至连一颗纽扣都没掉。第二年春天我把它弄丢了，我把它落在了某处，再也没有找回来。它是棕黄色的，在我把它随手放在商店女厕所里时，我甚至把它看成是我的“旧”雨衣了，那样也好。我以前从来没有过一件类似的雨衣，我妈妈要是知道我就这样不小心地把它弄丢了，一定会昏倒的。现在想想我还做了一件聪明事。我离家时穿了一件浅色的短外套，跟夹克差不多，当我穿上雨衣的时候，当然会把浅色外套脱下来。然后我把浅色外套口袋里的东西都拿了出来，放进了雨衣口袋。接着我很随意地把这件浅色外套放到了一个正在卖打折夹克的柜台，好像我拿着它到离柜台稍远的地方看了看，又决定不要了。我知道根本没人注意到我，在我离开柜台之前，我看见一位妇女拿起了我的夹克，翻来覆去看了看。我真想告诉她，她可捡到了便宜货，这件衣服值三美元九十八美分。

甩掉了这件浅色外套让我觉得轻松多了。这件衣服是我妈妈给我买的，虽然我挺喜欢它，而且它也不便宜，但它容易被人认出来，我不得不把它替换下来。我敢肯定如果我把它放到袋子里扔到河里或者诸如垃圾车一类的地方，迟早都会被发现的。即使没人看见我这么干，十有八九也会被发现，然后他们就会知道我在克雷恩市换了衣服。

那件浅色外套没有被人发现，他们最后一次发现我的踪迹是洛克维尔市的某个人说在克雷恩火车站见到了我，她就是通过浅色外套认出我的。从那儿以后，人们就再也不知道我去哪儿了。这一半要归功于运气，一半要归功于我聪明的计划。两三天以后，报纸上仍然有报道说我人在克雷恩市。有人说在街上看见了我，还有一个女孩在去商店买衣服时被警察扣住了，直到她能找到人认出她。他们确实在尽力寻找，但是他们在找露易莎·泰瑟尔，而我从甩掉我妈妈给我买的那件浅色外套的那一刻起，就不再是露易莎·泰瑟尔了。

我对一件事很有信心：这个国家任何一天都一定会有成千上万个十九岁的女孩子，她们金发，身高五英尺四英寸，体重一百二十六磅，如果有成千上万个这样的女孩，她们中的很多人都会穿着贴身的棕黄色雨衣。在克雷恩市，当我离开那家百货商场时，我开始留意有多少人穿着棕黄色的雨衣，在一条街区上我就碰见了四个人，所以我觉得自己隐藏得很好。从那以后我让自己更像一个隐身人了，我做了那些我告诉妈妈我打算做的事——我在一家小咖啡馆停下脚步吃了一个三明治，然后又去看了场电影。我不慌不忙，优哉游哉，在晚上想找一个睡觉的地方时，我想我可以在火车上过夜。

有意思的是，根本没人关注我，那天有成百上千的人看见了我，甚至有一个水手在电影院时想带我走，但实际上没有一个人真正看到了我。如果我入住的是一家宾馆，前台的职员可能会注意到我；如果我想在一家上点儿档次的餐馆用餐，而身上穿着廉价的雨衣，也会惹人注意。但是当天我的一言一行和那些穿着打扮和我一样的其他女孩别无二致。唯一可能记住我的人是火车站卖给我车票的男人，因为像我这样穿着旧雨衣的女孩通常是不会在夜里十一点买火车票的，当然，这一点我也考虑过。我买了一张到阿米蒂维尔市的票，这个城镇距离这儿有六十英里远。我之所以选择阿米蒂维尔市作为一个绝佳的伪装地点是因为那儿有一所大学，它不像我最近刚刚离开的死气沉沉的小学院，而是有着友好氛围的大学校，在那里，在家穿雨衣看起来完全没有问题。我告诉自己我是一个在家里刚度完周末返校的大学生。火车是午夜后才到达阿米蒂维尔市的，我下了火车进入车站，但这看起来并不奇怪。因为我在那里喝咖啡来消磨时间时，有七个女孩——我数了一下——穿着和我一样的雨衣进进出出，在夜里的这个钟点，似乎没人觉得上下火车有什么稀奇的地方。旅客中的一些人手中拿着行李箱，我还真觉得在克雷恩时要是买一个行李箱就好了，但那样又会让我去电影院时太显眼，而且女大学生们回家度周末通常也不会费事带行李箱的。她们在家里有睡衣和多余的长袜，只需在珍贵的雨衣的口袋中放上一把牙刷就行了。所以我不担心行李箱，不过，我知道我很快就需要一个了。当我在喝咖啡时，我的思路从好像我是一个在家里度完周末返校的女大学生转到了我是一个从学校正在往家走想待上几天的女大学生。我无时无刻不在琢磨如何伪装得天衣无缝，不管怎么说，我确实上过一段时间的大学。我正在寻思，就在此时那封信甚至还在邮寄过程当中，即使美国政府想尽量缩短邮寄时间。信是写给我父亲的，告诉他我为什么选择了从大学退学，我想这也是我最终决定离家出走的原因。我还在寻思当我父亲接到这封从大学寄来的信件时，他会怎么想，会说些什么，乃至会采取什么样的行动。

报纸上也披露了信件的内容，他们认为大学的事情是造成我离家出走的原因，但是如果只是那样，我觉得我是不会出走的。不是这样的，其实很长时间以来我就一直想这样做了，我清楚地记得自己的这种念头，我制订了详细的计划确保万无一失，事实证明我的出走是成功的。

坐在阿米蒂维尔火车站，我正在给自己找一个充分的理由，为什么我会在周一的大半夜从大学回家，而且刚刚在家度完周末。正如我所说，我总是尽力要把事情做得天衣无缝，我喜欢为自己正在做的事情找一个好的理由。没人问我，但是如果有人问了，最好我应该知道如何回答他们。最后，我找了一个理由，就说我姐姐第二天要结婚，我不得不在周一赶回去等着在婚礼上给她当伴娘。我想这很好玩，我不想找一个悲伤或者吓人的借口作为回家的理由，比如母亲病了，或者父亲出车祸了，因为要是那样的话，我必须装出又伤心又着急的样子，这可能会吸引别人的注意力。所以，我回家是为了姐姐的婚礼。我在车站里闲逛，一副无所事事的样子，碰巧在经过一道门的时候，有个女孩从里面走了出来，她穿着一件和我一模一样的雨衣，如果有人恰好看见会认为我是从里面走出来的。在买票之前，我去了趟女厕所，又从鞋子里掏出二十美元。我还剩下将近三百美元，钱是从我父亲的书桌里拿的，我把大部分钱都藏在了鞋子里，因为说实在的，我真的不知道身上还有哪儿比那儿更安全。我装在口袋里的钱是仅仅够第二天花的，整天穿着一双鞋底有一沓钞票的鞋走路可真不是什么惬意的事儿，但是好在鞋很结实，这种舒服的老式鞋只要你真不在乎款式，还算是凑合的。我在离家之前给鞋穿了新的鞋带，所以我能把鞋系得紧紧的。这下你知道了吧，我计划得多周密，没有漏掉一点儿细节。如果他们让我全权筹办我姐姐的婚礼，他们就不会跑那么多的冤枉路，有那么多的尖叫和那么多的歇斯底里了。

我买了一张去钱德勒市的火车票，这是本州最大的城市，也是我最终的目的地。该市便于藏匿，因为从洛克维尔市来的人往往会绕过它，除非他们有专门的理由来此地。如果他们在洛克维尔市或者克雷恩市找不到合适的大夫、矫形牙医、心理分析师，或者他们想要的衣服料子，他们会直接去一些真正的大城市，比如州府所在地。钱德勒市对于藏一个人来说足够大，但在来自洛克维尔市的人们看来，它并没有大得像个大都市。阿米蒂维尔火车站卖票的人一定碰见过很多女大学生全天候、不分早晚地购买去钱德勒市的火车票，因为他接过我的钱，把票扔给我时连头也没抬。

很好笑，他们一定来钱德勒市找过我了，因为他们不太可能忽略有可能找到我的地方，但是也许洛克维尔市的人们打心眼里不会相信有人会选择钱德勒市，因为至少我没觉得有人来这儿找过我。我的照片也理所当然地登在了钱德勒市的报纸上，但是就我所知，没有一个人会多看我两眼。我每天早晨起床，然后去工作，下班后在商店里购物，和皮库克太太一起去看电影，每个夏天都出门去海滩而从不担心被人认出来。我的生活和其他人一样，衣着打扮和其他人一样，甚至想法也和其他人一样。三年中我只见过一个来自洛克维尔市的熟人，她是我母亲的朋友，我知道她来钱德勒市只是为了在这儿的狗市给她的贵宾犬配种。她没有左顾右盼，好像这儿的人她都认识，她的眼睛只盯着贵宾犬的发烧友，我所做的只是在她走过时，闪身到了门廊里，她连看都没看我一眼。

当我坐上火车时，另外两个女大学生也上了开往钱德勒市的火车，也许她们两个也是回家参加她们姐姐婚礼的。她们俩都没穿棕黄色的雨衣，但是其中一个穿着一件旧的蓝夹克，效果和穿雨衣也差不多。火车一开动我就睡着了，我醒来的时候，一时在很短的时间内我都搞不清楚自己身在何处了，过了一会儿才醒过神儿来。我在按部就班地实施自己精心制订的计划，而且效果比预想的还要好，我几乎要笑出声了。在车上，我身边的人都在睡觉。然后，我又睡着了，再也没有惊醒，直到早上七点左右，火车到达了钱德勒市。

就这样我来到了钱德勒市，我是在昨天午饭后离家出走的，而现在是早上七点钟了，正是我姐姐婚礼开始的时刻，而我已经离他们很远了，从任何意义上来看，我都知道他们绝不会去找我。我有一整天的时间让自己在钱德勒市安顿下来，所以我出了火车站，在车站不远处的一家餐馆吃了早点，接下来该去找一个住的地方，还有一份工作。但我做的第一件事是买了一个行李箱，有意思的是如果你在火车站附近买一个行李箱的话，人们是不大会注意你的，而且在火车站附近拿个行李箱也很自然。我特意从众多的商店中挑了一个什么都卖的小店，买了一个便宜的行李箱、一双长筒袜、几条手帕、一个小旅行闹钟，我把所有东西都放入了行李箱，用手拉着。天下无难事，除非你做事时要么垂头丧气，要么兴奋。

后来，有一次我和皮库克太太一起读报纸上关于我失踪的消息时，我问她是否认为露易莎·泰瑟尔已经来到了钱德勒市这么远的地方，她表示不太可能。

“他们现在又说她被绑架了，”皮库克太太告诉我，“我也是这样想的。绑架、谋杀，他们对被绑架的年轻女孩总是做出可怕的事情来。”

“但是报纸上说，没有勒索的条子呀。”

“那是他们这么说。”皮库克太太冲着我摇着头，“我们怎么知道那家人没在保守秘密呢？或者，如果她被一个变态杀人狂绑架了，难道他会送勒索的条子？像你这样的年轻女孩子涉世不深，我可以慢慢教给你。”

“我真为那个女孩感到难过。”我说道。

“你可能想不到，”皮库克太太说道，“也许她是心甘情愿地跟他在一起哩。”

我没料到皮库克太太在我到达这个陌生城市的第一天早上就出现了，这对我来说可是天大的幸运。在我吃早点的时候，脑子里已经盘算好了：我是个快十九岁的女孩儿，来自州北部一个不错的家庭，出身也很好，自己一直在存钱，为的是来钱德勒市上当地的一所商科学校学习文秘课程。在上学期间，我要找份挣钱的工作，商科学校的课程在秋天才开始，所以我应该在夏天打份工，存下点儿钱，然后再决定我是否真的要去上文秘课程。如果我不打算待在钱德勒市，在我离家出走这件事平息之后，我再到别的地方去很容易。这件雨衣对于我打算成为中规中矩的年轻女孩的形象好像不大合适，所以我把雨衣脱了下来，搭在了我的胳膊上。我觉得在着装上的设计总体上我还是挺成功的。在我离家之前，我原本打算穿身套装，为了尽量显得朴素和不扎眼，我挑了一身灰色的套装，里面穿了一件白色的衬衫，这样可以随时做些小的调整，比如穿不同的衬衫，或者在翻领上别不同的饰针，这样我决定伪装成什么样的人都可以扮得很像。现在这身套装穿在身上绝对适合一个打算上文秘课程的年轻女孩，当走在大街上，我看上去和众多的人一样，拿着行李箱，把雨衣搭在手臂上，从火车上每一分钟下来的人看上去都是这个样子。我买了份晨报，在药店待了一会儿，喝了杯咖啡，看了看房屋出租的信息。一切看起来都那么普通——行李箱、外套、出租房——当我问一位卖苏打水的店员，樱草街怎么走的时候，他甚至都没抬头看我一眼。他当然不在乎我是否真的要去樱草街，但是他仍然很有礼貌地告诉了我街的位置以及去那儿的公交车。我坐公交车倒不是真的为了省钱，但是人们要是看到一个处处节约的女孩乘着出租车会大跌眼镜的。

“我可忘不了第一天早上看见你时的模样。”有一次，皮库克太太告诉我，那是很久以后的事了，“我一眼就看出来，你是那种我愿意租给她房间的女孩——安静，有教养。但是你看起来非常害怕大城市。”

“我不害怕，”我说道，“我只是对能否找到一个好的出租房有点儿担心。我妈妈嘱咐了我很多需要当心的事情，我事事害怕达不到她的要求。”

“无论谁的妈妈都可以随时来我家，看看她们的女儿是不是租住在了一户好人家里。”皮库克太太有些愠怒地说道。

不过这是真的。当我走进皮库克太太位于樱草街的房子时，和她一见面，我就知道虽然我事先做过计划，但事实上结果比计划的还要好。房子古老、舒适，我的房间也不错，而我和皮库克太太也是一见如故。当她听说我妈妈告诉我一定要保证所找的房间干净，所住的小区安全，如果一个单身女孩在天黑了以后回家，不用担心有混混尾随时，深表同意。当她听说我为了存点儿钱和学习文秘课程，想找一份真正的好工作，挣了足够的钱也能每周给家里寄点儿时，更是频频称是。皮库克太太认为孩子们是亏欠父母的，所以在他们长大成人以后，应该补偿父母在他们身上的付出。在那栋房子里，仅仅在一个小时之内，皮库克太太对我在州北方的家庭情况就了如指掌了，虽然大部分是我杜撰出来的：我的母亲是个寡妇，我的姐姐刚结的婚，但和丈夫还住在我母亲家中，我还有个弟弟——保罗，让我的母亲很是操心，因为他似乎不太想安顿下来。我的名字叫露易斯·泰勒，我这样告诉她。在那一刻，甚至我告诉了她我的真名字，她也绝不会和报纸上的那个失踪女孩联系在一起，因为那时她觉得她已经完全了解我的家庭了。她还想让我确信，而且我再写信给家里时，转告我母亲，我待在这个城市的这些日子里，皮库克太太决定自己承担起照顾我的责任，而且就像我母亲一样无微不至地关心我。最重要的是，她告诉我小区里有家文具店正在招聘销售小姐，于是我就去了。我离家还不到二十四个小时，我已经成为一个完全不同的我了。我是个叫露易斯·泰勒的女孩，住在樱草街，在一家文具店工作。

有一天，我在报纸上读到了这样一篇报道：一位著名的算命先生给我的父亲写了一封信，告诉他如何才能找到我。据他说，星象已经明确告诉他在花朵附近能够找到我。这让我大吃一惊，因为我住的这条街就叫樱草街，但是我的父亲还有皮库克太太以及其他的人都以为这个信息的意思是，我的尸体会埋葬在某处。他们徒劳地在我最后一次露面的火车站附近挖了半天，皮库克太太对于什么也没挖到的结果很是失望。我和皮库克太太关于我是和一个流氓私奔了，成了他的情妇，还是已经被碎尸，装在箱子里扔到了某处争论不休。过了一段时间，他们停止了对我的寻找，除了偶尔有不实的线索出现，会有一则小报道登载在报纸末尾的版面上。我和皮库克太太又开始对发生在芝加哥的一起光天化日之下的银行抢劫案的报道兴趣浓厚起来。快到我失踪一周年的日子了，我才意识到我离家出走已经有一年光景了，我买了一顶新帽子，在市中心吃了顿大餐来款待自己，回到家里的时候，正好听见收音机里晚间的新闻广播中传来我母亲的声音。

“露易莎，”她正在哀求，“请回家吧。”

“那个女人真是太可怜了，”皮库克太太说道，“试想一下她现在的心情。他们说她绝不会放弃寻找小女儿的希望，期待有朝一日她能活着回来。”

“您觉得我的新帽子怎么样？”我问她。

我决定不去上商校了。因为那家文具店已经决定开设几家分店，包括一家图书馆和一家礼品店，我现在已经是这家礼品店的经理了，如果事业进展顺利的话，我还可能当上总经理。我和皮库克太太已经商量过多次了，好像她一直是我母亲一样，我们认为如果放弃这份好工作，在别处另起炉灶就太傻了。我存下的钱都放到银行里了，我和皮库克太太都认为，过段日子，我的钱积攒到一定数量，就去买一辆车，或者去某地旅游，甚至是邮轮游。

我想说的是我现在自由了，过得也不错，从来没有动过回家的念头。可是倒霉透顶的是我再次和保罗不期而遇。本来我已经几乎不怎么想老家的人，也绝不想知道他们现在在做什么，除非碰巧在报纸上看到他们的一些动态，但是我在潜意识里还一直在惦记着他们，因为我从未停止对他们的思念。我站在大街上，吃惊得张大了嘴，几乎是脱口而出地喊出来：“保罗！”他转过脸来，当然我立刻就意识到了自己的冒失，但已经太晚了。他盯着我足足有一分钟，然后皱起了眉头，看上去很困惑。我能够看见他起初试图想记起我，接下来又试图想相信他的记忆，最后，他喃喃地说道：“这可能吗？”

他说我得回去，如果我不回去的话，他会告诉他们到哪儿可以找到我。他甚至还拍拍我的头说，如果有人去警局报告了我明确的消息，银行里会有一大笔赏金在等着他。他说在他领了那笔奖金后，非常欢迎我再次离家出走，只要我喜欢。

也许我确实想回家了，也许一直以来我都在暗地里等着一个回家的机会。也许那就是为什么我会在街上认出保罗，这种碰巧的事可能一百万年也出现不了一次——他以前从没来过钱德勒市，即使几分钟就有一班火车到这儿。他走出车站也就一小会儿，竟然就发现了我。如果那一刻我没有路过的话，如果他待在本来就该待的车站里，我就绝不可能再回家了。我告诉皮库克太太我要回趟家，去看看北边我的家人，我想这事也太可笑了。

保罗给我父母拍了封电报，告诉他们他找到了我，我们要乘飞机回去。保罗说他怕我再次逃跑，所以，最安全的方式就是一起坐飞机，因为他知道在万米高空中我是无法逃走的。

在从洛克维尔机场回家的路上，我看着出租车窗外的景色开始变得紧张起来了。我敢发誓三年来，我压根没想过这座城市，还有那些我过去很熟悉的街道、商店和房屋，但是现在我发现自己从来没忘记过这一切，就好像我从未去过钱德勒市，完全没见过它的房屋和街道，好像我从未离家出走过。当出租车终于拐了个弯，到了我们家的那条街道上，当看见我们家那栋古老的白色大房子的时候，我的眼泪几乎落了下来。

“我当然想回来。”我说道，而保罗则哈哈大笑起来。我想起了那张往返车票，我留着它有很长时间，把它当作幸运符，可是有一天，我在清理手袋时，把它给扔掉了。我至今还搞不明白，当我把它扔掉的那一刻，我是否曾想过我要不要回来，是否后悔把票扔掉。“一切都没变，”我说道，“我就是在这个街角刚好赶上了那趟公交车，那天我沿着行车道往下走的时候碰见了你。”

“如果那天我成功地阻止了你，”保罗说道，“你可能就再也不会尝试离家出走了。”

出租车在房子前停了下来，当我从车子里出来时，双膝都在颤抖。我抓住保罗的手说道：“保罗……等一下。”他用一种我过去很熟悉的目光看了我一眼，那目光仿佛在说“如果你现在想从我的手掌心逃脱的话，我会给你好看的”。他用手臂搂着我，因为我浑身抖成了一团，我们走过门前的小道，来到了大门前。

我想知道他们是否正在窗户前看着我们，对我来说很难想象我父母在这种情景下会是什么样子，因为他们平常总是表现得镇静、庄重和得体。我想要是皮库克太太的话，她早就跑到门前的小道上迎接我了，可是现在，眼前的大门紧紧地关着，我想我们是不是应该按响门铃，我以前从来没按过这个门铃。当我还在瞎琢磨的时候，卡罗尔为我们打开了房门。“卡罗尔！”我喊道。我吓了一跳，因为她看上去是那么苍老。随后，我想起我有三年没见她了，有了这些变化也理所当然，她可能同样也认为我看上去老了许多。“卡罗尔，”我说道，“哦，卡罗尔！”我得实话实说，看见她我还是很高兴的。

她看了我好一会儿，然后向后侧了一下身子，我的父母也都站在门口，等着我进门。如果我没稍微冷静一下的话，便会扑向他们，但是我犹豫了，一时间不知道应该怎么做。他们是不是还在生我的气，或者很伤心，或者看见我回来很高兴，当然了，当我脑子里想着这些乱七八糟的事的时候，我发现我所能做的就是呆立在那儿叫道：“妈妈？”语气中带着不确定。

她向我走来，把双手搭在我的肩膀上，长久地端详着我的面孔。泪水从她的双颊滑落，正如我以前想象过的样子，但是没有关系，我也憋了很久想要哭了，但现在，当放声大哭使我看上去更好时，我想做的只是咯咯傻笑。她看起来衰老、忧伤，而我觉着自己像个弱智。然后，她转过身对着保罗说道：“噢，保罗……你怎么能对我故伎重施？”

保罗吓坏了，我能看出来。“泰瑟尔太太……”他说道。

“你叫什么名字，亲爱的？”我母亲问我。

“露易莎·泰瑟尔。”我傻乎乎地答道。

“不对，亲爱的，”她说道，声音很柔和，“你的真名叫什么？”

现在我倒是能哭出来了，但我知道这已经不起任何作用了。“露易莎·泰瑟尔，”我说道，“这就是我的真名呀。”

“为什么你们这帮人就不能让我们消停会儿？”卡罗尔嚷道。她脸色发白，浑身颤抖，因为气愤几乎要高声尖叫了。“我们花了好几年时间想方设法地寻找我失踪的妹妹，像你这样的人看到了机会，想欺骗我们好去领赏，你们难道就那么铁石心肠吗？难道你们可能觉得这是个来钱快的好机会，就忍心一次次地伤害我们，一次次地让我们伤心欲绝吗？为什么你们就不能放过我们？”

“卡罗尔，”我父亲说道，“你吓着这个可怜的孩子了。年轻的女士，”他对我说，“我完全相信你并没有认识到你行为的残忍性，你看上去是个好姑娘。你试想一下如果是你自己的母亲……”

我试想一下自己的母亲，我直愣愣地看着我的母亲。

“如果有人像这样想利用她，我敢肯定在此之前没有第二个人跟你提过，而这个年轻人……”我不再看我的母亲了，目光转向了保罗，“已经给我们家带来了好几个女孩了，假称是我们失踪的女儿。每一次被戳穿时，他都申辩说他也被骗了，他这么做绝不是为了钱，而每一次我们都希望那真的是我们的女儿呀，可每次都让我们很绝望。第一次的时候，我们甚至还被蒙骗了好几天，那个女孩长得很像我们的露易莎，言谈举止也像露易莎，她知道我们家庭内部的各种小玩笑，还有外人所不知道的一些事情，除了露易莎，应该没人知道。可到头来，她还是个冒名顶替的骗子。而露易莎的母亲——我的妻子——每次刚有了希望，就备受打击，痛苦不堪。”他用手搂住我的母亲——他的妻子——还有卡罗尔，他们一起站在那儿看着我。

“听着，”保罗失去控制似的说道，“给她一个机会，她知道自己就是真的露易莎，至少应该给她一次证明这一点的机会。”

“怎么证明？”卡罗尔追问道，“我敢肯定如果我问她一些事情……好吧……比如说，在我的婚礼上她原打算穿什么颜色的衣服……”

“是粉色，”我说道，“我想穿蓝色的，但你说最好穿粉色的。”

“我肯定她是知道答案的，”卡罗尔继续说道，好像我刚才什么也没说，“你带到这儿来的其他女孩儿，保罗，她们也都知道。”

再解释也没什么用了，我早应该认识到这一点。也许他们现在已经习惯去寻找我，他们宁愿始终在寻找我的过程中，而不愿让我回家。也许我的母亲凝视我的脸，丝毫看不出露易莎的样子了，看见的只是我长期以来小心而专注地扮演的露易斯·泰勒，没有任何的可能让我看上去能再与露易莎相像了。

我有点儿为保罗感到遗憾，他不像我那样对他们有着充分的了解，很显然他觉得仍然有可能跟他们好好谈谈，让他们能张开双臂欢迎我，哭喊着“露易莎！我们失踪得太久的女儿啊！”然后转过头来付给他赏金。从此以后，我们就幸福地生活在一起了。在保罗还在试着跟我父亲争辩的时候，我往屋里走了几步，再次注视着客厅。心里明白我不会再有时间四下看看了，我想在离开前最后再看一眼我曾经的家。我姐姐卡罗尔一直在警惕地盯着我，我很纳闷在我之前的那两个女孩想偷什么东西，而且我还想告诉她，如果我曾打算偷这栋房子里的任何东西的话，早在三年前就偷了，根本不用等到现在，在我第一次离家的时候，我可以带走任何我想要的东西。现在这儿没有一件值得我带走的东西了，这种感觉甚于以前。我认识到我想做的一切就是留下来——我太想留下来了，我觉得我要抓住楼梯栏杆大声尖叫着不放手。然而，即使我的情绪失控可能会带给他们一丝回忆，让他们想起失踪的可爱的露易莎，但我意识到这几乎不可能说服他们邀请我留下来了。我能想象出我一边双腿乱踢，高声尖叫，一边被拖出了我自己的家。

“多么可爱的古屋呀。”我有礼貌地对着我的姐姐卡罗尔说道，她警觉地不离我左右。

“我们家住在这儿有好几代了。”她回应道，仅仅是出于礼貌。

“家具也好漂亮。”我说道。

“我妈妈喜欢古董家具。”

“指纹。”保罗大声叫道。我们要去找一位律师，我寻思保罗是这个意思，或者保罗认为我们最起码要去找一位法律界人士。我倒是想知道，当他发现我们根本不会去找什么律师的话，他会怎么想。当我的父母还有我姐姐卡罗尔已经认定我不是露易莎的话，我无法想象这世界上有任何律师能说服他们让我回家。法律能让我母亲盯着我的脸就能认我吗？

我认为应该用某种方式让保罗明白我们根本无能为力了，我走过去，紧挨着他站着。“保罗，”我说道，“你难道看不出你这样只能让泰瑟尔先生很生气吗？”

“你说得对，小姐，”我父亲说道，并冲我点了点头，表明他觉得我还是个明白人，“他这样威胁我是捞不到任何好处的。”

“保罗，”我说道，“人家不希望我们再赖在这儿了。”

保罗开始说了一堆话，然后生平第一次考虑不再坚持下去了，大步走向了大门。当我转身跟着他的时候——心想我这次大张旗鼓回家，可我们连前厅都没进去——我的父亲——原谅我，应该叫泰瑟尔先生——紧跟在我的后面，拉住了我的手。“我的女儿比你年轻，”他对我友善地说道。“但是我敢说你在某地也有家人，他们也爱着你，想让你幸福。回到他们身边去吧，年轻的女士。让我给你些建议，就当我是你真正的父亲。离这家伙远点儿，他很坏，一无是处。回家去吧，那儿才是你该待的地方。”

“我们可是深有体会，家里人为女儿是多么的担心和牵挂呀，”我母亲说道，“回到爱你的人身边去吧。”

我猜想那指的是皮库克太太吧。

“一定要保证平安到家呀，”我父亲说道，“让我们帮你负担一些路费吧。”我想把手抽回来，但他已经把一张折好的钞票塞到了我手中，我不得不拿着了。“我希望有那么一天，”他说道，“有人也能这样对待我们的露易莎。”

“再见，亲爱的，”我母亲说道，她伸出手来，拍了拍我的脸颊，“真心祝你好运。”

“我希望你们的女儿终有一天会回来的，”我跟他们说道，“再见。”

钞票的面值是二十元的，我把钱给了保罗。与给他添的麻烦相比，这点儿钱似乎有点儿寒酸。不管怎么说，我又能回到文具店里的工作岗位上了。我母亲依然在广播中呼唤着我，一年一次，在我离家出走的那个纪念日。

“露易莎，”她呼唤道，“请回家吧。我们都希望我们亲爱的孩子回家，我们需要你，非常想念你。你的妈妈和爸爸爱你，永远不会忘记你。露易莎，请回家吧。”





小房子


她的第一个想法是，我得要几盏体面的灯；第二个想法是，我得养一条狗或者其他什么动物，至少是一只鸟，总之要是个活物。她站在一个狭小的厅里，旁边是行李箱，这是属于她的一个小房子，她的第一个家。她手上拿着前门的钥匙，她知道，也记得她婶婶，总是把后门的钥匙贴上标签，挂在后门边的钩上，侧门的钥匙挂在侧门边的钩上，走廊门的钥匙挂在走廊门边的钩上，地下室的钥匙挂在地下室门边的钩上。也许当她砰的一声把前门关上时，身后的这些钥匙都会轻轻跳跃起来，前前后后地摆动。每件能动的东西都会发出某种友善的声音，她心想，可能是一只猴子或者一只猫，或者任何一个没有被填实的东西——她意识到，她好像被催了眠似的，正在盯着门厅镜子上方的一个驼鹿头。

她想在一片静寂中弄出点儿动静，于是她咳嗽了一声，声音不大，在满是灰尘的黑漆漆的屋子里回荡。“好了，我在这儿啦，”她告诉自己，“这儿属于我了，我想干什么就能干什么，没人能让我离开，因为这房子是我的。”她走过去抚摸立在狭窄楼梯底部的雕花立柱——这也是她的，也完全属于她了——小房子里真切的现实带给了她惊喜；她想到，这是真正的拥有，谢谢你，婶婶。“我的天呀，”她一边想，一边摩拳擦掌，“我自己的房子得自己亲自动手打扫一下了。”她不禁面露微笑，因为她想到明天和后天要做的这些让人开心的工作，想到以后所有的日子，她都要住在自己的房子里，每天都要让房子保持干净和清新。

她想吹口哨，弄出点儿动静让屋子充满生机，她转身打开了右手的门走进了昏暗、拥挤的客厅。我真希望在黄昏的时候没有第一眼就看见它，她心想。婶婶肯定不相信明亮的光线，我好奇她在这间屋子里怎么看得见路。在门边的一张矮桌上模模糊糊能看清一盏台灯的轮廓，当她按下开关的时候，一束微弱的灯光弥散到了房间里。这样，她能够离开门边所站的地方，探险似的进入了显然是她婶婶最喜欢的房间。自从她婶婶死了以后，客厅肯定没人进来过，甚至没有再开过门或者开过灯。一块茶巾，褶边还有一半没有缝好，搭在一张椅子的扶手上。一想到有很多茶巾，褶边缝得整整齐齐，在过去的很多年里，每当她生日或者圣诞节时，她都能得到这些茶巾——如今这些茶巾仍然躺在包装纸里，或者在火车站她行李箱的箱底——就让她感到一种突如其来的亲切和一些惭愧。“至少我现在可以用她的茶巾了，在她的房子里。”她心想，但马上又回过味来，“但是这房子现在是我的了。”她会把茶巾整齐地摆放在放日用纺织品的橱柜中。她甚至可以把这块茶巾的褶边缝好，她拿起了它，把它仔细地折叠好，把针掖在了她婶婶缝补时的地方，等有时间，她会安静地坐在椅子上，在房子的客厅里，拿起它再慢慢缝补。她婶婶的眼镜放在桌子上，在最后那一刻，她婶婶是不是放下了手里的针线活儿，摘下了眼镜？有所准备地、有条不紊地去赴死？

别再去想它了，她严厉地告诫自己，婶婶已经故去了，这屋子很快又会热闹起来。我明天当天不太黑的时候会来个大扫除。在这么昏暗的灯光下婶婶竟然能做这些针线活儿，她怎么做到的呀？她把缝了一半的茶巾盖到眼镜上，把它遮住了。然后，又拿起了一张镶嵌在银色的相框里的合影，她认出来了，是婶婶和另一些微笑着的女性朋友并肩站在树下。这张照片对婶婶一定很重要，她想：我得把它放到某个安全的地方去。这间屋子对她来说并不陌生，很久以前，当她还是个孩子的时候，会时不时地来这里，但时间太久远了，对屋子和婶婶的记忆，多年来被愤世嫉俗、哀伤忧郁和让人厌烦的失望所覆盖。或许正是因为渴望找回童年时代的欢声笑语，才让她迫不及待地回到这里接受遗产。音乐盒一直放在角落里，轻轻拨动它，她从音乐盒那里带来了一个遥远的、甜蜜的、叮当响的音符。明天我要好好地玩一下音乐盒，她向自己承诺着，而且要把窗户大开，让清新的空气涌进来，把所有的小摆设都安全地收藏到阁楼上面去。这个房间可以布置得很漂亮——她转过身，头偏向一侧，正在思考——我要把那些破烂和乱七八糟的东西都清理出去，但是可以把旧的长沙发留下来，也许可以用色彩鲜艳的东西罩在上面。那把大椅子可以留着，也许还有一两张小桌子也可以留着。壁炉台也还不错，我会在上面放一瓶花，而且是从自己的花园里采的花。在壁炉里生上旺旺的炉火，我带着一条狗坐在那儿，手里拿着针线活——还有两三盏很棒的落地灯。我明天要把这些东西都置办齐——再也不会不开心。明天我要买灯，开窗通风，还要玩音乐盒。

离开身后微弱的灯光，她从客厅穿过一间小的阳光房，这个地方的桌子上，摊着一本打开的杂志。婶婶永远也没法读完正在读的这篇故事了，她心想。她把杂志快速合上，把它按顺序放到桌上的一摞杂志上。“我也要订杂志，”她打定主意，“还有当地的报纸，再从村里的图书馆里借上几本书。”她从阳光房来到了厨房，记起要开灯，于是拉了一下从天花板中央悬下来的灯绳。她的婶婶在窗台上留下了一个熟烂了的西红柿，它使得厨房里有一股浓重的腐烂味道。这时，她浑身一激灵，意识到后门还大敞着，记起婶婶曾说过，真切得就好像话音还在耳边，“要把门修一下，我希望自己能记得找人看一下弹簧锁。”

现在我自己不得不做这件事了，她心想。我明天早晨会找一个人来。她在装餐具的抽屉里找了一个纸袋子，抽屉里总是放着很多纸袋子，把窗台上烂掉的西红柿铲到了纸袋子里，然后把袋子扔进了后门台阶旁的垃圾桶里。回来的时候，她把后门猛地一带，弹簧锁竟然锁住了。钥匙就挂在她知道的那个地方，在门的旁边，她把它取下来，反锁上了门。毕竟只有我一个人待在这屋子里，她一想到这儿，觉得脖子后面吹来一股凉飕飕的风。

婶婶最后喝茶的茶杯还放在水槽的边上，已经洗过了，因为长时间地放在那里，水渍已经风干了。她想，也许婶婶放下手里的针线活儿，走进厨房，想在睡前给自己沏杯茶。我想知道他们是在哪儿发现她的，她晚上一个人总是要喝杯茶。我真希望在她活着的时候能来看她一次。“这些可爱的、古老的餐具现在是我的了，”她想道，“这些家用的餐具、雕花玻璃，还有银茶具。”婶婶的毛衣挂在地下室门的圆把手上，好像她刚刚脱下来一样，她的围裙挂在水槽边的一个挂钩上。她想婶婶总是把东西随手乱放，现在她再也无法回来取毛衣了。她记得门厅的柜子里有好几件精致的、手工刺绣的小围裙。她又联想到了自己，穿着围裙，用这些画着各种图案的薄杯子，以古老茶道的方式端上香气沁人的茶水，也许可以送给那些邻居喝，他们也许会过来看她讨喜、开放、明亮的小房子。我必须办一个鸡尾酒派对，她又在计划着。我敢肯定这屋子里除了蒲公英酒以外，什么酒也没有。

首先，每天早晨下楼在婶婶的厨房中给自己准备早餐，这似乎是件奇怪的事，她突然回忆起了自己很小的时候在厨房桌子旁吃燕麦粥的情景。她想，使用婶婶的餐具，还有古旧的大咖啡壶——虽然可能不是这个咖啡壶——同样好像有些怪怪的。这个咖啡壶似乎有着反复无常和大发雷霆的脾气，不愿意在陌生人的手上驯服。我明天早上要去买点儿茶，再给自己买一个小一点儿的新咖啡壶。灯、咖啡壶，还要找人修理锁。

想了一会儿，她把婶婶的毛衣、围裙打包捆在了一起，把它们拿到屋外扔进了垃圾桶。她安慰自己，好像这些东西对人没有好处了，婶婶所有的衣服都要扔掉。她脑海中想象着这样的画面：她穿着自己时髦的城里的衣服，站在明亮的客厅里给正在说笑的朋友们讲这栋小房子的情况。“嗯，你们真该见见我刚来时的情景，”她会这样告诉他们，“你们要是能看见我第一晚走进这屋子的情景就好了。昏暗的小灯，简直摆满了小玩意儿，还有一个布料做的驼鹿头——说真的，一个充满填充物的驼鹿头，我说的是这个意思——还有婶婶放在桌子上的针线活，以及水槽中肯定是她最后用过的茶杯。”我要不要告诉他们，她在疑惑，关于婶婶怎样把针线活镇定地放下，而坦然面对死亡呢？还有她再也读不完的杂志，挂上毛衣后，就觉得心脏停止了跳动呢？“你们真该看看我刚来时的样子，”她会一边从杯子里啜着水，一边跟他们说。“黑暗、恐怖；我小时候常常来这儿，但说实话，我印象中它从来没这样乱过。没想到这次让我大吃一惊，她把这房子留给了我，我做梦也没想到会拥有它。”

她用手指轻轻地抚摸着冰冷的咖啡壶，突然感到有些内疚。她心想：我明天会把你清洗干净的。很遗憾我没能参加葬礼，我本来应该想方设法参加的。明天我要开始大扫除了。正在这时，她觉得有些眩晕，惊恐地听见有人在敲后门。她想：我没意识到这里这么安静。她屏住呼吸，快速走到门边。“谁呀？”她问道，“稍等。”她的双手颤抖着，把门闩拨开，打开了门。“是谁呀？”她向黑乎乎的门外问道。随后，她发现两个老妇人正对着她，她惊魂未定地强挤微笑，“哦，”她说道，“你们好！”

“你一定是她的侄女吧？伊丽莎白小姐吗？”

“是的。”她心想：这两个老太太，帽子上还别着花，可能急不可待地想见见我。“你们好。”她一边说，一边心想：我就是这所房子原来主人的侄女，迷人的伊丽莎白，可现在这房子是我的了。

“我们是多尔逊姐妹。我是阿曼达·多尔逊小姐，这位是我的妹妹卡洛琳·多尔逊小姐。”

“我们是离你最近的邻居。”卡洛琳小姐把一只干瘦、褐色的手放在伊丽莎白的袖子上，“我们住在这条小巷的下面，是你可怜的穷婶婶最近的街坊。但是那天我们没听见任何动静。”

阿曼达小姐向前挪了挪脚步，伊丽莎白不得不往后退了一点儿。“你们是否愿意进来？”伊丽莎白问道，想起不能没有礼貌，“来客厅坐会儿吧，我刚才正在四处查看房子，我也是刚到这儿，”她一边说，一边向后退着，“我去把灯打开。”

“我们看见灯光了。”阿曼达小姐准确无误地走进了小客厅。“这不算我们正式的拜访，你理解的。我们改天白天再来正式拜访，但是我得承认我们是对灯光好奇才过来的。”

“我原以为是他回来了。”卡洛琳小姐又把手放到了伊丽莎白的袖子上，好像是她把伊丽莎白领到了客厅。“他们说看见他了，你知道。”

阿曼达小姐自己坐下了，好像这是老相识固有的权利，她坐在了矮桌子旁边的软椅上，而卡洛琳小姐则坐在了剩下的另一把舒服的椅子上。这是我自己的房子，千真万确，伊丽莎白心想，但她很不自在地坐在了门边一把硬椅子上。我明天头一件事就是把灯的事情搞定，她心想，这样才能更好地看清客人。

“你们住在这儿很长时间了吗？”她傻乎乎地问道。

“我希望你没有打算对这房子做大的改动，”阿曼达小姐说道，“你知道，你婶婶很爱她的这个小房子。”

“我还没有时间做什么计划。”

“你会发现每样东西都和她走时一样。我自己把她的手袋拿到了楼上，把它放到了洗脸台的抽屉里。别的东西都没人动过。当然了，尸体除外。”

哦，难道还能放在这儿吗？她想开口问，但话到嘴边，变成了“我小时候常常来这儿。”

“所以他不是为了图她的钱，”卡洛琳小姐说道，“是我姐姐把她的手袋从厨房的桌子上拿走的。我看见她这么做的，她把它拿到楼上去了，什么东西也没丢。”

阿曼达小姐往前凑了凑身子，“你会带电视机来吗？从城里？收音机呢？”

“我还没想那么多。”

“我们能听见你电视机的声音，毫无疑问。我们是离你最近的街坊，我们能看见你们家的灯光。毫无疑问你的电视机的声音会很大的。”

“要是她高声尖叫，我们应该能听到的。”卡洛琳小姐一边说，一边举起了干瘦的手以示强调。“他们说她一定是认出了他，我自己也确信，关于这人到底是谁，诺尔顿警长有了精明的想法。我相信我们也都有自己的怀疑对象。”

“妹妹，这些都是谣言。伊丽莎白小姐肯定厌恶这些谣传。”

“我们早上到这儿的第一件事，伊丽莎白小姐，就是跟警长说了我的想法。”

“妹妹，伊丽莎白小姐不想为你这些荒诞的故事伤脑筋。让伊丽莎白小姐留些对她婶婶的美好记忆吧。”

“我不明白。”伊丽莎白的目光从一位老太太紧绷的苍老的脸上转到另一位的脸上。她心想，这是两个讨厌的老太婆。她说道：“听他们说我婶婶是死于心脏病呀。”

“据我看来——”

“我妹妹喜欢打听小道消息，伊丽莎白小姐。我料想你会把你婶婶所有的好东西都打包带走吧？”

伊丽莎白瞥了一眼她身边的桌子，一个粉色的瓷器盒子，一个玻璃镇纸，一个钩针织的小块桌巾，上面放着一整套蓝色的瓷器小猫。“拿了一些。”她说道。

“为了给电视机腾地儿，可怜的婶婶，她为自己的小东西考虑了很多。”她皱了皱眉，“你在这儿连个烟灰缸也不会找到。”

伊丽莎白挑战般地把手中的香烟摁灭在了小粉盒的盖上。

“妹妹，”阿曼达小姐说道，“给伊丽莎白小姐从厨房拿一个茶碟来吧，从日常的瓷器中拿，不要从带花的那套中拿。”

卡洛琳小姐一边吃惊地看着，一边提着她沉重的长裙和伊丽莎白的烟头从桌子中间匆忙跑向了厨房。阿曼达小姐又把身子凑了过来，“我不允许我妹妹传播谣言，伊丽莎白小姐，如果你鼓励她就大错特错了。”

“但是她想说些关于我婶婶的什么事呀？”

“你婶婶已经去世而且下葬两个月了，我认为你没去参加葬礼？”

“我抽不开身。”

“准确地说，从城里跑到这儿，我料想你拥有了这个房子很是开心。”

“您说的没错，我确实很开心。”

“我认为你婶婶几乎不会做出别的选择。妹妹，赶紧给伊丽莎白小姐茶碟，快点儿，要不整个房间都该着火了。”

“谢谢。”伊丽莎白从卡洛琳小姐手中接过有缺口的茶碟，在上面摁熄了香烟。她心中又嘀咕道：还有烟灰缸。明天得买灯、烟灰缸、咖啡壶。

“她的围裙不见了。”卡洛琳小姐跟她姐姐说。

“已经找不着了？”阿曼达小姐转过身直视着伊丽莎白，“恐怕我们会看见很多变化，妹妹。现在伊丽莎白小姐正等着我们离开呢，今天晚上伊丽莎白小姐就决心开始收拾打包了。”

“真的，”伊丽莎白一边无助地说着，一边做着手势，“真的……”

“你婶婶所有的好东西。这次不算我们正式的拜访，伊丽莎白小姐。”阿曼达小姐傲慢地站起身，卡洛琳小姐也跟着站了起来，“我们在三天之内还要见面的。可怜的婶婶。”

伊丽莎白跟着她们回到了厨房，“真的，”她又说了一遍，“请不要走。”但是阿曼达小姐根本没有理会。

“这个门的锁芯有问题，”阿曼达小姐说道，“我们走后，你要留神看看它是不是确实锁上了。”

“他们说他就是从这个门进来的，”卡洛琳小姐耳语般说道，“这门要常锁呀。”

“晚安，伊丽莎白小姐。我很高兴地知道你打算让这屋里的灯都亮着。我们能看见你家的灯光，你知道，从我们家的窗户那儿就能看到。”

“晚安，”卡洛琳小姐说道，转身再次把手放到伊丽莎白的胳膊上，“记住，锁好门。”

“晚安，”伊丽莎白说道，“晚安。”招嫌的老太婆，她心中暗想，老疯子。迟早我会找她们理论理论，她俩可能是居民区中的害虫。她观察着，她们肩并肩地沿着小路走去，没有交头接耳，长裙摆动着。“再见。”她又一次喊道，但她们俩都没有回头。癫婆子，她心想，砰的一下把门关上了；锁芯也带住了，她取下钥匙，又反锁了一道。我会把驼鹿头给她们的，她想，婶婶可能想把它送给她们。天色已晚，我应该给自己找张床，我甚至还没到楼上看看呢。我将给她们每人一件旧货。我自己拥有了这间漂亮的小房子，它完完全全属于我自己了。

她快乐地哼着小曲，转身回到了客厅。我想知道他们是在哪里发现她的？她突然想到；会是在客厅里吗？她在门口停住了脚步，死盯着软椅，心里在嘀咕：他进来就站在她身后吗？而她还在做着针线活儿吗？然后从地板上捡起眼镜，把它放到了桌子上吗？也许他抓住她时，她正在读杂志，也许她刚刚洗完杯子和碟子，正打算转身去门边拿毛衣。那时这间屋子也这么安静吗？这间屋子总是这么安静吗？

“不，不，”她大声说着，“这太傻了，明天我要去弄一条狗回来。”

她坚定地紧闭双唇，走出客厅，关上了灯，然后又回来，把门边上的小台灯也关上了，柔和的黑暗降临在了她的周围。他们是在这儿发现她尸体的吗？她穿过阳光房时又禁不住琢磨着，然后，她又大声喊道：“这太傻了。”随手又关了这里的灯。她的身后一片黑暗了，她又回到了厨房，检查后门是否安全地锁上了。他不会再进来吧，一想到这儿，她浑身打了一个寒战。

楼梯上没有灯。她想：我可以把厨房的灯整宿开着，但很快她又否决了这个想法。她们会从她们家的窗户那儿看到灯光的。他不会潜伏在楼梯上等着她吧？她扶着墙，身后是从厨房里透过来的昏暗的灯光。她走上了楼梯，瞪大眼睛想看透黑暗，用脚摸索着路，头顶上只有一片黑暗，她伸出双手向前胡乱探着。先是一堵墙，然后是一扇门，她继续向门的一侧摸去，直到她的手指触碰到了门把手。

门后会有什么等着她呢？她一想到这儿，马上转过身，疯了似的跑下了楼梯，跑进了亮着灯的厨房，厨房的后门已经上了锁。“别把我一个人留在这儿，”她一边说，一边转身看着身后，“请不要把我一个人留在这儿。”




阿曼达小姐和卡洛琳小姐各自守在温暖的小炉子的一边。阿曼达小姐吃着一块水果蛋糕，喝着一杯茶；卡洛琳小姐吃着一块棉花糖蛋糕，也喝着一杯茶。“跟我想的一模一样，”卡洛琳小姐说道，“她应该给我们端上点儿吃的东西。”

“城里人的做派。”

“她应该给我们尝尝她从城里带来的点心。咖啡壶就放在厨房，等客人走了，自己再吃东西，这可不怎么礼貌。”

“那是城里人的做派，妹妹，我怀疑她不会是个好街坊。”

“她的婶婶就不会那么做。”

“当我想到她正在那个小房子里翻箱倒柜搜刮值钱的东西时，我就为她的婶婶感到悲哀。”

卡洛琳小姐放下她的盘子，自己点了点头。“她可能不喜欢这儿，”她说道，“也许她不会久留的。”





生日派对


詹妮自己已经计划好，我只是很勉强地被说服了，因为詹妮死缠烂磨，并夸下海口要好好表现，可我觉得这根本就不可能。实际上，她甚至说，如果能让她办一场穿着睡衣的派对，她会把自己的房间收拾得利利索索，并保持整整一个月。我觉得她的这个保证远远超出了可能性的范围，我只相信她最想要的莫过于开个睡衣派对。我丈夫认为我竟然同意她的要求是一个错误。“你正在犯一个可怕的、严重的错误，”他对我说，“可别说我没事先提醒过你。”我的大儿子劳瑞也对我说，我同意詹妮的计划是个错误。“妈妈，”他说道，“你会后悔的，在你的后半辈子你会对自己说，‘为什么我会让那个傻乎乎的女儿，在那天晚上去开一个睡衣派对呀？’你会后悔半辈子的。当你成了老太太时，你也会这么说的……”

“那我该怎么办？”我说道，“我都答应她了。”在詹妮十一岁生日的早上七点三十分，大家一起坐在餐桌旁吃早餐。詹妮坐在那儿好像没有听到我说的话，用汤勺快乐地舀着麦片，她的眼睛里充满幻想，猜测晚饭后究竟有什么东西会出现在包裹里。她列出的心仪的生日礼物清单里包括一匹活的小马、一双旱冰鞋、一双属于她自己的高跟鞋、一套带有口红的化妆盒、一台电唱机和唱片，以及一只同她一起玩的可爱的小猴子，她希望所有这些东西都会出现在她面前。她叹了口气，放下了汤勺，又接着叹了口气。

“你当然知道，”劳瑞对我说道，“我的房间就在她的隔壁，对吧？我会像每天晚上一样得在那儿睡觉，对吧？你知道我会睡在我的床上，对吧？”他耸了耸肩，“咯咯笑，”他说道，“咯咯，咯咯，咯咯，咯咯，咯咯，咯咯。在凌晨两三点钟的时候——还在咯咯，咯咯，咯咯地笑。只要是正常的人，都无法忍受。”

詹妮瞪着他，“我们干吗不把这孩子的出生证明烧掉呢？”她问道。

“咯咯，咯咯。”劳瑞说道。

柏瑞挥舞着烤面包片，“如果詹妮有了她的生日礼物，我可以玩玩吗？”他问道，“如果我很小心的话，我能玩这些……”

所有人都开始说话，立刻把他的话给淹没了。“咯咯，咯咯。”劳瑞喊道。“你可别说我事先没提醒你。”我丈夫大声说。“不管怎么说，我已经答应她了。”我说道。“生日快乐，亲爱的姐姐。”莎莉唱道，而詹妮在咯咯地笑。

“你听听，”劳瑞说道，“你听见她笑了吧？整个晚上都会是这样——她们五个人。”他摇着头，就像一个人总是在那儿告诫，不厌其烦地反复告诫，千万不要让木马通过特洛伊(1)的城门一样。最后他跺了跺脚，去拿他的课本和小号。詹妮开心地松了一口气，柏瑞又要张开嘴打开话匣子，他的父亲和莎莉再加上我，一起对他说：“嘘，住嘴。”

詹妮说她太激动，吃不下麦片了。早晨很冷而且下了霜，我命令女儿们穿上冬天的外套，戴上温暖的帽子，我又给柏瑞穿上了羽绒服。而劳瑞，自认为不怕冷，来到楼下，对我充满同情地说道：“疯了，我跟你说，你们都疯了。”对他父亲说道：“都是被詹妮害的。”他走出了后门，骑上了自行车，不再理会我发疯似的喊叫，让他穿上外套，或者至少穿上件毛衣。

我检查了一下其他孩子出门前的准备工作：牙已经刷了，头发也梳了，手绢也带好了。我告诉两个姐姐过马路时要牵着柏瑞的手，告诉柏瑞过马路时也要抓紧姐姐们的手。把柏瑞课间的加餐小点心放进了他的夹克衫口袋里，第三次提醒詹妮带好拼写本。我拴好狗以防门开着时，它们跑出去，然后跟每个孩子说再见，而且再次祝詹妮生日快乐。我在厨房的窗户边注视着他们沿着行车道随意地一路走走停停，一边聊天，一边停下来指指点点。我又一次把门打开，对他们大声喊着要好好走路，要不然上学该迟到了，他们不理会我，我又喊着抓紧时间。有一会儿，他们加快了脚步，蹦蹦跳跳地，然后走到了行车道的尽头，走上了人行道，马上融进了等车上学的一大群孩子当中。人群中有扎着红色头巾的，穿着蓝色夹克的，还有戴格子帽子的。他们每天早晨上学，中午时又放学，午饭后再去上学，三点钟的时候，终于又慢吞吞地回来了。我重新回到桌子边，筋疲力尽地坐了下来，伸手去拿咖啡壶。“五个人太多了。”我丈夫解释道，“一个客人足够了。”

“开一场睡衣派对只有一个客人怎么行，”我嗔怪地说道，“而且，不管她邀请了谁，都会得罪剩下的那三个人。”

午饭的时候，我已经摆放好了四张折叠床，其中两张床是从邻居家借的，可当她知道我借床的目的，一下子目瞪口呆了。“我觉得你一定是疯了。”她说道。詹妮的卧室实际上有两个房间，一个是小间，一个大得多，因为那里放着她的书柜，所以她把它称为她的图书馆。我把一张折叠床放进了她的卧室里，紧挨着她的床，房间里几乎没有转身的余地了。剩下的三张折叠床我并排放进了她的图书馆，让它有了一种学生宿舍的效果。詹妮的图书馆的尽头是客房，除了劳瑞的卧室，其他人的卧室都在客房的另一边。劳瑞的卧室和詹妮的图书馆仅仅隔着薄薄的一堵墙。我用全部的花色床单和印花枕头来修饰这五张折叠床，每张床上还额外放了一条家里的毯子，最后还不得不用上了沙发上的软垫。

当詹妮从学校回到家里，我让她躺下休息一会儿，用我这辈子所有的严厉中最轻描淡写的一次说道，她晚上可能要熬夜。只过了十五分钟，她就来到楼下问是否能为派对穿着打扮一番。我说派对最早八点钟才开始，让她去吃个苹果，再去躺会儿。过了十分钟，她又下来了，解释说她兴许太激动了，怕过一会儿穿不好衣服，而且现在就应该穿上她的派对服装，这也是公认的常识。我生气地说，如果在晚饭上桌之前她再下楼的话，我就会亲自给她的四位客人打电话，告诉她们这场派对取消了。最后她躺在楼上电话旁边的椅子上，跟她的朋友卡洛尔在电话里聊了有半个钟头左右。

虽然是她自己点的菜，但显然她没能吃几口。她嚼着一小块羊肉，伸手把一盘土豆泥挪到了自己跟前。然后告诉她爸爸和我，她不能理解我们有那么多次生日，是怎么忍耐过来的。她爸爸说他自己已经对这类事情习以为常了，而且事实上在上了点儿岁数——比如说——三十岁后，对过生日就觉得很平淡了，詹妮不相信似的叹了口气。

“再多一个像这样的派对就会要了她的老命。”劳瑞说道，他发着牢骚。“卡洛尔，”劳瑞说，好像在念叨着一份可怕的名单，“凯特、劳拉、琳达、詹妮。你一定是疯了。”他对我说道。

“我觉得你的狐朋狗友才多呢。”詹妮说道，“我想厄尼今天因为乱扔纸团，被叫到柯克兰小姐的办公室不下六次吧？我想查理……”

“你和查理结伴从学校回家的时候，好像并没觉得他有多坏呀，”劳瑞反驳道，“我猜想，你是不是更愿意和……”

詹妮的脸涨得通红。“我哥哥在我生日这一天可以随便侮辱我吗？”她向爸爸告状。

为了庆祝詹妮的生日，莎莉帮我清理了桌子，而詹妮双臂交叉在胸前，堂而皇之地坐在那儿等待着。当桌子清理好了之后，我们让詹妮一个人待着，然后大家都聚集到了书房里。当我丈夫点亮了插在粉白相间的蛋糕上的蜡烛时，莎莉和柏瑞从门厅壁橱后面拿出了他们自己挑选的，包裹得很可爱的礼物。柏瑞的礼物一看就知道是皮革制品套装工具盒，虽然他费了很大的心思包扎礼物，但还是不能用包装纸完全裹上盒子，所以可以清楚地看到这份礼物的名字。莎莉的礼物是三本书，劳瑞的礼物是一张唱片，实际上是为他自己选的。（“这是给我妹妹的，”在音像店里，他大为急切地告诉店员，每只手上都拿着一张埃尔维斯·普雷斯利(2)的唱片，“是送给我妹妹的——不是给我的，是给我妹妹的。”）劳瑞还拿着一台蓝色的小电唱机，这是我和我丈夫决定送我们长女的生日礼物，这份礼物比一只小猴子或者一双高跟鞋要合适得多。我拿着两个盒子，里面装着爷爷奶奶、姥姥姥爷送的礼物，一个盒子里装着一件花色的绗缝裙子和一件时尚罩衫，另一个盒子里装着一件硬衬布衬裙。手里端着生日蛋糕，我们鱼贯而入地进到餐厅，詹妮正一个人坐在那里。“祝你生日快乐。”我们齐声唱道，而詹妮只瞟了一眼，掠过我们跑到电话机旁。“马上来我家，”她说道，接着又说，“卡洛尔吗？卡洛尔，你听着，我得到它了，电唱机。拜拜。”

到了差一刻八点的时候，詹妮在衬裙的外面又穿上了新的罩衫和短裙。柏瑞兴高采烈地拿出了皮革制品套装工具盒，电唱机也插上了电，不管愿意不愿意，我们听见埃尔维斯·普雷斯利的歌声从四面八方响了起来。劳瑞把他关在自己的房间里，和外面的欢庆场面完全隔离开来。“我心甘情愿地买它们。”他解释道，“我甚至从我的储蓄中拿出一大笔钱来买它们，但是你们没人可以强迫我去听。”

我把一张牌桌搬到了詹妮的房间里，把它挤在了两张床的中间。我在桌上铺了一块漂亮的桌布，还摆放了一大盘苹果、一小碟糖果、一盘装饰得很好看的纸托蛋糕，还有一个冰桶，里面放着五瓶葡萄味的汽水。詹妮把她的电唱机也拿到了楼上，把它放到桌子上。劳瑞帮她把电唱机的电源线插上，但条件是在他安全地回到自己的房间之前，她不能把电唱机打开。让劳瑞觉得愤愤不平的是，我们这么做简直完全无视家里宝贝儿子平静的心灵和健康的睡眠。我把一副算命的扑克牌，还有一本解析梦的图书放到了桌上。

万事俱备，我和我丈夫以及詹妮正诚惶诚恐地坐在客厅里，这时第一位客人到了。来的客人是劳拉，她穿着蓝色的派对穿的连衣裙，给詹妮带来了一条幸运手链，詹妮戴上了它。然后卡洛尔和琳达也一起到了，一个穿着绿色的派对装，另一个穿着时尚的罩衫和裙子，就像詹妮的装束一样。她们对詹妮的新罩衫和裙子都赞不绝口，其中一个人给她带来了一本书，另一个人给詹妮的玩偶带来了长裙和小帽。凯特随后也几乎马上就到了，她穿着一条和詹妮差不多的宽大长裙，也有一个衬裙。她和詹妮比较了一下衬裙，然后彼此一口咬定对方的衬裙要比自己的漂亮得多。凯特送给了詹妮一个钱包，里面装着一分钱表示好运。所有的女孩都带着过夜的袋子，除了凯特，她带着一个小行李箱。“你们会觉得我要在这儿住上一个月吧，看我带了这么多的东西。”她说道。我觉得我丈夫哆嗦了一下。

每个女孩都在互相赞扬着对方，对每个人衣装上的饰物也夸奖不已。最后大家公认詹妮的裙子最好看，裙子来自加利福尼亚州，比佛蒙特州的裙子款式要时尚得多。她们一致认为钱包也歪打正着地选得恰到好处，因为和詹妮裙子上的小红花搭配得很完美。劳拉的鞋是大家见过的最漂亮的。琳达的派对装是奥纶纤维制的，所有人都很喜欢。琳达说如果她自己评价的话，褶边处不应该那么松沓。卡洛尔戴了一条项链，没人能看出它其实不是真的珍珠穿成的。琳达说我们住的房子真漂亮，她一直在跟她父母说，她真的希望他们家也能有这么个房子。我丈夫打趣地说，我们家的房子随时可以出售。凯特说我们家的狗活泼可爱，劳拉说她特别喜欢我们家的绿椅子，在椅子上不老实地上下摇晃。我随口说道，如果她们在我们家待上很长时间，这把绿椅子就不会像劳拉最后一次来时那么崭新和漂亮了，说完才觉得好像有点儿失礼。詹妮赶忙打圆场，说她屋里还准备了纸托蛋糕和埃尔维斯·普雷斯利的唱片，她们一哄而上向詹妮的房间跑去，就像一群野马蹦蹦跳跳地上了后面的楼梯，嘴里喊着：“蛋糕，蛋糕。”

莎莉和柏瑞都上床了，但是得到允许可以不用睡，因为今天是周五，而且还是詹妮的生日。柏瑞把送给詹妮的皮革套装工具盒拿到了他的房间里，打算给他亲爱的姐姐做一双平底鞋。因为莎莉和柏瑞没有受到参加派对的邀请，所以我给他俩用小碟一人拿了一个纸托蛋糕，每人一杯果汁，三颗糖。莎莉一边读着童话，一边吃着蛋糕，她问是否能让她播放留声机。我觉得既然在这样热闹的气氛中，甚至连柏瑞也无法睡上片刻，便当然允许她这么做了。当我下楼的时候，柏瑞把我叫住了，问我他是否可以播放他的留声机，当然我也很难说不行。

当我下楼的时候，我的丈夫已经在客厅里稳稳当当地坐下来开始读新生的作文了。“一切似乎很……”他说道，我觉得他最后一个词儿好像要说“安静”。但是，就在这时，埃尔维斯·普雷斯利的歌声从詹妮的房间里传了出来，接着从劳瑞的房间里传出了他愤怒的号叫，然后他把留声机也打开了。为了回应埃尔维斯·普雷斯利的歌声，他拿出了早已选择好的自己的一个很老的路易斯·阿姆斯特朗(3)的专辑。从前面楼上莎莉的房间里飘过来《彼得与狼》的序曲；从更远的地方，柏瑞的房间里传来了破了音的和弦声预示着（点火升空！）——《航天员登上了月球》开唱了。

“你说什么？”我问我丈夫。

“噢，当圣人行进到达时……”(4)

“我说似乎很安静。”我丈夫冲我大声喊道。

“这只猫，单簧管用低音区……”

“我想你，我要你……”

“准备发射：五、四、三、二……”

“我想成为其中一员……”

“确实很安静。”我也大声喊叫着回复道。

“砰”的一声，柏瑞的火箭升入了太空……

柏瑞控制了一小会儿音量，因为他能唱（点火升空！）——《航天员登上了月球》歌曲的每句歌词，但是此时大灰狼已经悄悄爬到了彼得的门前，詹妮在播放埃尔维斯·普雷斯利的《蓝色皮鞋》，而劳瑞又拿出了他的小号。他没有用弱音器，一般情况下家长不允许在房子里这样做，所以，有好几分钟，他吹的声音很大。从詹妮房间里传来的吉他声无疑多少有些干扰，而且这时詹妮和她的客人们开始唱起歌来，所以劳瑞的小号声变得不稳了，失去了《圣人》的调调，不可避免地被《蓝色皮鞋》给带跑了调。他咒骂了一句，又努力往《圣人》的曲调上吹，但最后不得不承认曲调全被四、三、二、一、砰打乱了。这时又清晰地传来了彼得的一段欢快音乐，随后，詹妮又调整了一下唱针，我们的房子被埃尔维斯·普雷斯利的《伤心旅馆》的摇滚乐震得地动山摇。

“妈妈，”莎莉向楼下喊道，“我都听不见猎人们过来了。”

“点火升空！”

劳瑞的房门砰的一声关上了，他咚咚地跑下了后面的楼梯，气冲冲地走进客厅，手里拿着他的唱机和小号。“爸。”他可怜兮兮地说道。

他的父亲点了点头。“能吹多响吹多响。”他说道。

“我明白你，小伙子。”他们决定吹艾灵顿公爵(5)的曲子，我来到厨房，把所有的房门都紧闭，以便进入我耳朵的是一种稳定的混合的打击乐声。声音把窗户框震得微微抖动，让锅碗瓢勺在悬挂的墙上轻轻地作响。快到九点半的时候，我离开厨房去楼上检查萨莉和柏瑞的情况，发现莎莉有点儿打蔫，已经取下了《彼得与狼》，放上了另一张唱片，描述的是一种可笑的啄木鸟，但是她已经快睡着了。我跟她说了晚安，然后又走进柏瑞的房间。柏瑞穿着太空服已经睡着了，可能正在梦见他在月亮上暗淡的环形山附近漫步，小片羽毛弄得满床都是。我把他的留声机关上，给他盖上了被子。当我再回到莎莉的房间时，她已经睡着了，翻开的童话书放在肚子上，她的小猫咪在枕头上紧挨着她的脸颊。我拿走了她的书，把小猫咪挪到了床脚。小猫咪在那儿等着，确信我下了楼梯以后，它又会蹑手蹑脚地走回莎莉的枕头边。莎莉舒服地翻了个身，小猫咪高兴地发出咕噜声。我下了楼，发现劳瑞和我丈夫正在很放松地听着爵士乐《搭乘A线列车》。

劳瑞正要换唱片，这时他迟疑了一下，抬起头，倾听着，然后又看了看他父亲。他的父亲也在倾听，楼上的留声机已经停了，劳瑞阴沉着脸摇了摇头。“不会消停的。”他说道。

他是对的。

大约半个小时后，我走到后面的楼梯下面，向楼上喊着让姑娘们安静些，但是她们好像没听见。显然她们正在玩算命扑克，因为我能听见有人正在呼唤一个黑高个男人，而另一个人则正挖苦着来自一个朋友的妒忌。我走到楼梯的半截，向上喊着，但她们仍然没有听见我的话。我走到楼上，用力拍着门，甚至想用头砰砰地撞石头墙。我能听见里面的姑娘们提到一个年轻小伙子的名字，这个小伙子也是劳瑞的一个朋友，和她们轻浮地调笑他的事情，而且把他和劳拉的名字联系在一起，提到他俩在一处僻静的地方一起分吃蛋糕。我听着好像是这样的。随即又传来一声疯也似的尖叫，我觉得很可能来自被中伤的劳拉。然后凯特又提到了另一个人的名字，把这个人的名字和琳达的名字联系在了一起，又传来一声高声尖叫，是琳达在矢口否认。我开始用双拳砸门，里面的人大概有一秒钟的时间不出声了，直到有人说：“也许是你哥哥吧。”然后听见里面有人大声喊叫：“走开！别待在那儿！不许进来！”

“乔安妮。”我说道，里面又是一片死寂。

“有什么事吗，妈妈？”詹妮终于出声了。

“我能进来吗？”我柔声问道。

“哦，请进吧。”小姑娘们齐声说道。

我打开门，走了进去。她们都正坐在詹妮卧室的两张床上。唱机的唱针臂已经从唱片上支了起来，但是我还能看见贴着埃尔维斯·普雷斯利肖像的唱盘在一圈圈地空转着。纸托蛋糕都吃光了，糖果也没了。算命扑克牌也散乱地扔在了两张床上。詹妮穿着粉色的短睡衣，在寒冷的夜晚显然太单薄了。琳达穿着蓝色的短睡衣。凯特穿着女大学生们爱穿的那种滑雪服似的睡衣。劳拉穿着带有花边的女睡袍，白底上是粉色的玫瑰。卡洛尔穿着黄色的短睡衣。她们的头发乱蓬蓬的，脸颊是桃红色的，很不舒服地挤在两张床上，已经过了她们平常的就寝时间了，很显然姑娘们都已经兴奋过头了。

“你们难道不认为，”我说道，“你们最好睡会儿觉吗？”

“哦，不不不。”她们又一起说道。而詹妮还补充了一句，“派对才刚刚开始。”她们就像一捧水灵灵的娇嫩花朵，于是我说道——我知道劳瑞会发现我的话中带有应该受到批评的纵容——我还可以再给她们一小会儿时间来熬夜。

“扯淡。”凯特小声嘀咕着，很明显指的是小圈子里才明白的玩笑话，其他的姑娘都忍不住咯咯笑了起来，除了卡洛尔，她生气地喊道：“我过去没熬过夜，也绝不熬夜，现在更不会熬夜了。”

回到楼下，我对我丈夫和劳瑞说道：“我还记得当我大约是詹妮这个年龄的时候……”话语中充满了怀旧的味道。

“我只是希望邻居们都睡觉了，”我丈夫说道，“或者他们不知道声音是从我们家传出来的。”

“也许小区中的每个人都看见这些姑娘进来了。”劳瑞说道。

“妈妈，”黑暗的餐厅中传出詹妮急切的声音，我被吓了一跳，赶紧走了进去。

“听着，”她说道，“事情变糟了。”

“怎么啦？”

“嘘，小点儿声，”詹妮说道，“是凯特和琳达。我原打算让她们两个睡在我的图书馆房间里，可是现在凯特不跟琳达说话了，因为她说琳达今天在学校拿了她的午餐盒，而且还说她中午没有而且后来也没有把饭盒还给她，所以现在凯特不想跟琳达睡一个屋了。”

“呃，那么，为什么不把琳达安排在……”

“嗯，你看，我打算和卡洛尔睡在一个房间，因为我真的不能告诉其他人，但她是她们当中我最要好的朋友，而现在我又不能把凯特和琳达安排在一起……”

“为什么不把她们中的一个人安排和你一个房间呢？”

“嗯，我不能把卡洛尔和劳拉安排在一起。”

“为什么不能？”我对小声说话有点儿不耐烦了。

“嗯，因为她们两个人都喜欢吉米·沃森。”

“哦。”我说道。

“而且不管怎么说，卡洛尔穿的是短睡衣，而凯特和劳拉没穿。”

“听着，”我说道，“如果我现在就偷偷地穿过前厅，把客房的床收拾出来，然后你把一个人安排睡在那儿，也许是吉米·沃森，你觉得怎么样？”

“妈妈。”詹妮的脸涨得通红。

“对不起，”我说道，“从你图书馆的床上拿一个枕头出来，把一个人安排在客房睡，让她们先忙会儿别的，我几分钟就收拾妥当，我只是希望还有两条富余的床单。”

“呃，谢谢你。”詹妮转过身，然后又停了下来。“妈妈？”她说道，“听了我刚才说的话，别以为我喜欢吉米·沃森。”

“我脑子里从来没有这种想法呀。”我说道。

我跑到楼上，找到了两条床单。但它们有点儿小，也不是彩色的，那就意味着它们都是压箱底的。当我把客房的门关上的时候，我乐观地想至少詹妮的难题已经解决了，如果我可以把吉米·沃森和天生一头银发的卡洛尔危险的争风吃醋的问题忽略不计的话。

劳瑞正播放着《麝鼠漫步》，詹妮在大约十五分钟后又一次来到了餐厅。“嘘，”她说道，我进来正想跟她说话，“凯特和琳达想在客房一起睡觉。”

“但是我想你刚才还说凯特和琳达……”

“她们俩又和好了，凯特为拿了琳达的午餐盒道了歉，而琳达为认为是她拿的道了歉，她们现在又是好朋友了，除了劳拉有点儿不高兴，因为凯特现在又说她更喜欢哈瑞·本森。”

“超过喜欢劳拉？”我傻乎乎地问道。

“哦，妈妈，是超过喜欢吉米·沃森，当然了，只有我觉得哈瑞·本森是个笨鸟。”

“他在路口巡逻，却让你弟弟柏瑞自己穿过街道，当然是个笨鸟。事实上，如果我能自动和本能地找一个词来形容小哈瑞·本森的话，那肯定就是……”

“哦，妈妈，他并不是。”

我已经错过了我每天睡觉的时间了。“好吧，”我说道，“哈瑞·本森不是个笨鸟，如果凯特和卡洛尔要睡在客房里，我也没意见，只是她们别……”

“是凯特和琳达。”

“呃，凯特和琳达。只要她们别再咯咯地傻笑了。”

“谢谢。那我也可以睡在客房吗？”

“什么？”

“那是个大床。我们想很安静地谈论……”

“没关系，”我说道，“睡哪儿都可以，但只是睡觉。”

她十分钟后又下楼了。劳瑞和他父亲正在一边吃着饼干和奶酪，一边讨论“酷”这个词可能的来源，就像在“酷酷的爵士”这个短语中。

“听我说，”詹妮在餐厅里说道，“凯特也能睡在客房里吗？”

“但是我觉得凯特已经……”

“好吧，刚才确实说了她睡客房，但是她们又不能睡在一个房里了，因为凯特确实拿了琳达的午餐盒，而且她还打破了暖水瓶，卡洛尔看见了，所以卡洛尔告诉了琳达，凯特就不让卡洛尔睡在客房了，但是我又不能让卡洛尔和劳拉待在一起，因为劳拉说卡洛尔的短睡衣很难看，琳达又去告诉了卡洛尔。”

“那琳达这么做就不对了。”我说道，感觉自己有点儿错乱了。

“所以卡洛尔说琳达……”

“没关系，”我说道，“你只用告诉我谁睡在哪儿就行了。”

“好吧，凯特和我睡在客房，因为现在大家都对凯特有意见。卡洛尔对琳达有意见，所以卡洛尔睡在我的房间里，而琳达和劳拉睡在我的图书馆里，我真的不知道还会发生什么事，”她叹了口气，“如果有人告诉劳拉琳达背后说了杰瑞，杰瑞·哈珀什么话的话。”

“那卡洛尔不能跟琳达换换，和劳拉睡一个房间吗？”

“噢，妈妈。你是知道卡洛尔、琳达和吉米·沃森他们之间的关系的呀。”

“我想我一时给忘了。”我说道。

“好了，”詹妮说道，“我只是想我得让你知道一下每个人都睡哪儿。”

大约在一点半的时候，劳瑞举起手说道：“听。”我一直想确认这种感觉，觉得就如同狂风吹打着树木和窗户好几个小时，突然一下子风停了。“这可能吗？”我丈夫说道。

劳瑞开始把他的唱片放到一边，轻轻地挪动脚步。我也只穿着袜子没穿鞋就走上了后面的楼梯，尽量不发出任何声响，打开了詹妮的房门，避免发出最轻微的吱嘎声。

詹妮在她的床上安静地睡着，她房间里的另一张床，还有图书馆里的三张床都是空的。考虑到吉米·沃森的名字所带来的灾难性效果，我发现其他四个女孩儿都睡在了客房的床上。她们身上都没盖被子，但也没有办法给她们盖上一条毛毯，因为盖到一个女孩身上，就可能蒙到了另一个女孩的脸上。所以我只是关上了窗户，踮着脚尖走了出去，来到楼下告诉劳瑞，现在平安无事了，他可以上床睡觉了。

然后，我自己爬到了楼上，倒在了床上，睡得很死，直到床头的闹钟显示三点十七分的时候，我被詹妮叫醒了。

“凯特觉得不舒服了，”她说道，“你得马上起来送她回家。”

邪恶的可能性


艾德拉·斯特兰沃思小姐优雅地沿着中央大街走着，她要去杂货店买点儿东西。太阳当空照耀着，经过昨夜一场大雨，空气变得很是清新。在斯特兰沃思小姐所住的小镇上，一切看上去都像被洗刷过一样，十分明亮。斯特兰沃思小姐深深吸了一口气，心想这世界上再没有什么比清香的夏日更美好的了。

当然，她认识镇子上的每一个人；她也喜欢告诉陌生人——那些游客，有时他们会穿过小镇，并停下来去赞叹斯特兰沃思小姐的玫瑰花——在她漫长的一生当中，她没有离开过小镇一天。她已经七十一岁了，斯特兰沃思小姐告诉游客们这些话时，嘴角上扬，露出了好看的小酒窝，有时她发现自己把这个小镇都当成她自己家的了。“我的祖父修建了普莱桑特大街上的第一栋房屋，”她说道，睁着她迷人的蓝色的眼睛，充满了骄傲的神情，“这栋房屋现在还矗立在这儿。我的家族住在这儿已经超过一百多年了。我的祖母种了这些玫瑰，而我的母亲照料着它们，就像我现在做的这样。我看着我的小镇在成长，我还记得当老刘易斯先生开杂货店的时候，那一年河水泛滥，洪水淹没了低洼处的棚户区。一些年轻人想把公园挪到今天新邮局前面的空地上，人们兴奋不已。他们想在那儿立上伊桑·艾伦(1)的雕像。”斯特兰沃思小姐皱着眉头，听上去语气严肃，“但是，应该立一个我祖父的雕像，如果没有我祖父和木材场，这儿就根本不会有城镇。”

虽然游客们时不时想要一些玫瑰，但是斯特兰沃思小姐从不把她的玫瑰赠人，这些玫瑰属于普莱桑特大街。可是斯特兰沃思小姐一想到有人想摘下这些玫瑰，把它们带到陌生的城镇和街道，就让她不胜困扰。当新牧师到来的时候，女士们会采摘花朵来装饰教堂，斯特兰沃思小姐则送了一大篮剑兰花。她当然也摘玫瑰，不过只会把它们放到碗里和花瓶里，摆到她祖父所建楼房内部的四处。

在夏天的一个早上，斯特兰沃思小姐沿着中央大街一路走下去的时候，她不得不每一分钟都停下脚步，要么跟某人说早上好，要么问候某人的身体状况。当她走进杂货店的时候，会有半打的人从货架和柜台那儿转过身子向她挥手致意，或者大声问候她早上好。

“早上好，刘易斯先生。”斯特兰沃思小姐终于找到机会对店主说道。刘易斯家族居住在镇子上的时间几乎和斯特兰沃思家族一样长，年轻的刘易斯一离开高中就来这家杂货店工作了，斯特兰沃思小姐也不再叫他汤米了，而开始称呼他刘易斯先生，而他也不再叫她艾迪了，而开始称呼她斯特兰沃思小姐。他们在高中时一起上学，一起去野炊，一起去参加高中的舞会和篮球比赛。但是现在刘易斯先生站在了杂货店柜台的后面，而斯特兰沃思小姐仍然单身一人住在普莱桑特大街的斯特兰沃思之家里。

“早上好。”刘易斯先生说道，紧接着又礼貌地补充了一句，“天气不错！”

“今天的天气真是不错。”斯特兰沃思小姐说道，好像只凭她个人就能决定天气的好坏。“请给我剁块肉吧，刘易斯先生，一小块，瘦一点儿的小牛肉。那些草莓是从亚瑟·帕克的园子里摘的吗？今年它们下来得有点儿早了。”

“今天早上他才给我送的货。”刘易斯先生说道。

“我要买一盒。”斯特兰沃思小姐说道。刘易斯先生看起来挺担心，她心想，有那么一会儿她有些犹豫，但是，她很快明白他肯定不是在担心草莓。他看上去的确很疲惫，可平时他是个挺开朗的人呀，斯特兰沃思小姐心想，差点儿要开口评论了，但是这是一个太私人化的话题，不能跟刘易斯先生提了。“再来一罐猫粮，还有，我想，还要一个西红柿。”

刘易斯先生没有吭声，把她要的所有货物都放到了柜台上，等着她结账。斯特兰沃思小姐好奇地看着他，然后说道：“今天周二了，刘易斯先生，你忘了提醒我了。”

“是吗？对不住。”

“想想你是不是忘了，我总在周二买茶叶呀，”斯特兰沃思小姐温和地说道，“请再给我拿四分之一磅的茶叶，刘易斯先生。”

“就这些了吗，斯特兰沃思小姐？”

“是的，谢谢你，刘易斯先生。多么好的天呀，对吧？”

“天真好。”刘易斯先生附和道。

斯特兰沃思小姐略微挪了挪身子，给哈珀太太在柜台前面腾了点儿地方。“早上好，艾德拉。”哈珀太太招呼道。斯特兰沃思小姐也打着招呼：“早上好，玛莎。”

“天不错。”哈珀太太说道。斯特兰沃思小姐也说道：“是的，天真好。”而刘易斯先生，在哈珀太太的注视下，点了点头。

“做糖霜蛋糕时，我发现家里的糖用完了。”哈珀太太解释道。当她打开手提包时，她的手微微颤抖着。斯特兰沃思小姐心里很纳闷，飞快地瞟了她一眼，她是不是没照顾好自己呀。哈珀太太已经不再像以前那样年轻了，斯特兰沃思小姐心想。她也许应该用点儿疗效好、作用强的滋补品。

“玛莎，”她说道，“你看上去气色不太好。”

“我身体挺好的。”哈珀太太简短地回应道。她把钱递给了刘易斯先生，接过了找给她的零钱和糖，没再说什么就走出了店门。斯特兰沃思小姐在身后看着她，轻轻地摇了摇头，玛莎看上去脸色确实不太好。

斯特兰沃思小姐拿着一小袋刚买的东西走出了商店，来到了灿烂的阳光下，她又停下了脚步，在克瑞恩夫妇的小宝贝前笑眯眯地蹲了下去。唐和海伦·克瑞恩夫妇真的是她所认识的两位最令人着迷的年轻父母，她满是溺爱地寻思着，看着做工精细的刺绣婴儿帽，以及蕾丝花边的婴儿车的遮阳篷。

“这小姑娘长大了会是大富大贵之人。”她对海伦·克瑞恩说道。

海伦开口笑了，“我们就想让她感受到自己是在富贵中长大，”她说道，“就像个公主。”

“公主有时也会碰到很多麻烦事，”斯特兰沃思小姐干巴巴地说道，“小公主殿下现在多大了？”

“下周二就六个月了，”海伦·克瑞恩说道，同时低下头全神贯注，充满好奇地看着她的孩子，“但是我一直都很担心她，你不认为她应该多活动活动吗？比如说，试着坐起来？”

“真是杞人忧天。”斯特兰沃思小姐说道，她心里觉得好笑，“每一次都会碰到一个这样的年轻母亲。”

“她似乎——不怎么聪明。”海伦·克瑞恩说道。

“胡说。一个宝宝一个样。有些孩子确实要比其他的孩子发育快得多。”

“我母亲也是这样说的。”海伦·克瑞恩开口笑了，看上去有点儿不好意思。

“我想你已经让年轻的唐对这样的事实很感到难过了，他的女儿已经六个月大了，可是至今还没开始去学跳舞，是这样吗？”

“我没跟他提这茬儿。我觉得她在我心里是这么的珍贵，我才会一直都很担心她。”

“好吧，现在就跟宝宝说对不起，”斯特兰沃思小姐说道，“她大概还在担心你为什么总是一惊一乍的。”她自顾自地微笑着，又摇了摇花白的头，继续沿着阳光照耀下的街道走去。有一次，她停下来，问小比利·莫尔为什么没有开着他爸爸耀眼的新车出来逛。还有一次，她和图书馆馆员钱德勒小姐在图书馆外面聊了几分钟，聊可以借阅的新上架的小说，以及每年图书馆的拨款如何支出。钱德勒小姐似乎心不在焉，好像心里在想着别的事情。斯特兰沃思小姐注意到了今天上午钱德勒小姐没有花心思整理她的头发，她叹了口气，因为斯特兰沃思小姐讨厌马马虎虎的人。

斯特兰沃思小姐思量，最近好像很多人都遇到了烦心事。就在昨天，斯图尔特家十五岁的琳达哭着在他们家前面的小路上跑向了学校，根本不管旁人看她的目光。镇子上的人以为她和哈里斯家的小子打架了，可下学后，他们跟往常一样，又一起出现在汽水店里了，但两个人看上去很严肃和忧郁。一定是在家里遇到麻烦了，人们推断，而且感叹现在的日子养儿育女太不容易了。

沿着街区走到一半的时候，斯特兰沃思小姐就闻到了她的玫瑰的浓香，于是稍微加快了脚步。玫瑰的香气意味着家园，而家园又意味着普莱桑特大街上的斯特兰沃思之家。斯特兰沃思小姐在自己家的前院门前停下了脚步，她习惯这样做，总是怀着深深的喜悦欣赏着她的房子。只见沿着狭窄的草坪，两旁开满了红色的、粉色的、白色的玫瑰，攀缘蔷薇爬满了门廊。房屋整齐的轮廓令人难以置信。房子是长形的，白色外墙像洗刷过似的。每扇窗户都闪闪发光，所有的窗帘都笔直垂挂，甚至门前小道上的石块都清扫得一尘不染。镇子里的人们都很好奇年老的斯特兰沃思小姐怎么能把这个老宅子打理成这样。甚至人们还口口相传着这样一件逸事：有一次，一位外地游客误把她的房子当成了当地的博物馆，把整栋房子浏览了个遍，竟然没发现自己的错误。整个镇子为斯特兰沃思小姐，还有她的玫瑰、她的古屋感到自豪，他们一起随着岁月成长。

斯特兰沃思小姐走上门前的台阶，用钥匙打开了前门，走进厨房，把买来的东西放下。她仔细考虑是否应该给自己倒一杯茶，最后还是认为这个时候已经距离午饭太近了，喝茶会让她没有胃口品尝刚买的小牛肉。她走进明亮又可爱的起居室。起居室是从她母亲和祖母的手上传下来的，现在仍然光彩照人，椅子包裹着明艳的印花棉布，窗帘也是同样花色的布料。所有的家具都很简单、洁净，地板上元宝针织成的地毯是斯特兰沃思小姐祖母和曾祖母的作品。斯特兰沃思小姐在窗前小桌上的花瓶里摆放着红玫瑰，此时屋里充满了玫瑰花香。

斯特兰沃思小姐走到角落中的一张窄窄的书桌旁，用钥匙打开了抽屉。她从来不知道什么时候她想写信，所以她把信笺放在里面，平时把抽屉锁上。斯特兰沃思小姐通常用的信笺是浓重的奶油色的，信头上印着“斯特兰沃思之家”的字样。然而，她要写别的信件时，会用一摞不同颜色的信笺，信笺是从当地的报亭买来的。她用粉色、绿色、蓝色和黄色来把一摞彩色的纸分层，这一习惯几乎成了全镇人的笑谈。镇子上的人买这种纸来写临时的、非正式的便条和购物清单。据说，人们收到一张写在蓝色纸上的便条是司空见惯的事，某某人很快就需要一摞新的纸了——就是指斯特兰沃思小姐，说明她已经用到蓝色那一层了。每个人都用相配套的信封来放置食谱，或者保存其他零碎的小东西，甚至在上学的午餐盒里，用它来盛小点心。刘易斯先生有时把它给了孩子们来装一分钱的散糖。

虽然斯特兰沃思小姐的书桌里整齐地摆放着羽毛笔，这些笔曾经属于她的祖父，书桌里还有一支洒金钢笔，是她父亲传下来的。斯特兰沃思小姐写信时，总爱用一小截铅笔头，而且用孩子气的木板印刷字体来写这些信。她一般在回家的路上就已经把信件的内容打好腹稿了，但是在落笔之前，她还是思考了一小会儿。她在一张粉色的信笺上写道：你以前一定没见过白痴婴儿吧？有些人就不应该要孩子，不是吗？

她对这封信很满意，因为她喜欢把事情办得恰如其分，漂漂亮亮。当她写错字的时候——她时不时地会写错字——或者一页上每行字的间距不均匀时，她就会把这一页纸废弃，扔进厨房的炉子里马上烧掉。当事情不得不去做时，斯特兰沃思小姐绝不会拖延。

考虑了一分钟之后，她决定还得再另写一封信，也许要写给哈珀太太，她已经给哈珀太太寄过好几封信了，但这封信还可以接着写。这次，她选择了一张绿色的信笺，而且写得很快：在你周二离开桥牌俱乐部的时候，你没发现大家究竟因为什么事而大笑不止吗？或者这事做妻子的真的只能最后知道吗？

斯特兰沃思小姐从不关心事实，她写的内容全部都是模棱两可、让人生疑的东西。如果没有收到斯特兰沃思小姐信件的话，刘易斯先生可能绝对想象不到他的孙子会从商店的钱柜里偷零钱。如果斯特兰沃思小姐没有给他们寄信，让他们睁大双眼的话，图书馆的管理员钱德勒女士，以及琳达·斯图尔特的父母，也可能会毫不怀疑地生活，丝毫不会注意到可能的邪恶就潜伏在身边。如果琳达·斯图尔特和哈里斯家的男孩真有什么事的话，斯特兰沃思小姐一定会感到震惊的。然而，只要这世界上还存在未被遏制的邪恶，那让自己镇上的人们警惕，就是斯特兰沃思小姐的责任。对钱德勒小姐来说，想了解雪莱先生第一任妻子的死因究竟是什么，比她一无所知地去冒险要明智得多。这个世界上邪恶的人很多，但镇子上只有一个斯特兰沃思小姐，再说，她自己本身也爱写信。

在想了一会儿之后，她在信封上写下了唐·克瑞恩的地址，用一个粉色的信封配上粉色的信笺。她好奇唐·克瑞恩是否会给他妻子看这封信。然后，她又写了第二个信封，绿色的，给哈珀太太。这时，她脑子里又有了一个想法，她选了一张蓝色的信笺，写道：你绝对不了解医生，记住他们也是人，就像我们其他的人一样也需要钱。试想如果手术刀稍微偏那么一点儿的话。伯恩斯医生从你的侄子那儿拿到费用和红包了吗？

她在蓝色信封上写下了老福斯特太太的名字，她在下个月要做一个手术。她早先还想到要多写一封信，写给校董会的主席，去问一问一位化学老师，就像比利·莫尔的父亲怎么会有钱去买一辆敞篷车。但是她一下子有点儿厌倦写信了，一天写三封信可以了。她明天再多写一些，这些信不是马上就能写完的。

她过去一直写信——有时一周每天写两或三封，有时一个月不超过一封——在过去的一年中。当然，她从来不会得到任何回信，因为她从不签名。如果她被人问起来，她会告诉人家，她的名字叫艾德拉·斯特兰沃思，一个多年来在镇上受人尊重的名字，不能签署在那种垃圾信件上。她所在的镇子必须保持清新、和美的气氛，但是随处可见人们的贪婪、邪恶和堕落，需要小心提防。这个世界是如此之大，但只剩下一个斯特兰沃思为人类而战了。斯特兰沃思小姐叹了口气，把她的书桌锁上，然后把这几封信放进了她大大的、黑色皮手提包中，准备在傍晚散步时，把它们寄走。

她把小牛肉烤得很香，把西红柿切成条，又倒了一杯泡好的茶，在她餐厅的桌子旁坐下来准备享用她的午餐。餐厅可以容纳二十二个人，如果有必要的话，可以在厅里加上第二张桌子。光线从餐厅高高的窗户中透进来，坐在温暖的阳光中，看着外面大片的玫瑰，拿着沉沉的、古老的银制餐具，还有精美的透亮的瓷器，斯特兰沃思小姐很惬意；她真不应该操心那么多别的事情了。不管怎么说，她想，人们必须优雅地生活，她又抿了一口茶。后来，她把盘子、杯子、小碟都洗净晾干，放回了架子上原来的位置，把银器也放回了红木制的银器盒子中。斯特兰沃思小姐走上精致的楼梯，进了自己的卧室，这间卧室是俯瞰玫瑰花的前屋，一直是她母亲和祖母的房间，她们的皇冠德贝瓷的梳妆用具和皮草服装都放在这儿，她们的扇子、银背的梳子、自己用的盛玫瑰的碗也放在这间卧室里。斯特兰沃思小姐在床头柜上放了一个盛着白玫瑰的碗。

她拉上了帘子，掀开了床上玫瑰色的床罩，脱了衣裙和鞋子，疲惫地躺到床上。她知道不会有门铃或者电话铃响起，在斯特兰沃思小姐午休期间，镇上没人敢打扰她的小憩。她睡着了，深陷在玫瑰花浓烈的香气中。

从午睡中醒来，她又在花园里工作了一小会儿，因为天热，她很快回到了屋里。接下来她该准备晚饭了。她蘸着淡黄油汁，吃了从自己的花园里摘的芦笋，还有一个半生不熟的水煮蛋。在吃晚饭的时候，她用自己的小收音机，听了晚间新闻广播和一个古典音乐节目。在她洗完碗，把厨房拾掇整齐后，便拿起帽子——斯特兰沃思小姐的帽子在镇上可是众所周知的，人们认为她是从她母亲和祖母那儿继承了这些帽子——她随后锁上了前门，把手提包夹在胳膊下面，开始晚上的散步了。她跟琳达·斯图尔特的父亲点头致意，他正在凉爽的傍晚洗车呢，她想，他看上去好像有麻烦了。

在镇子上只有一个地方能寄信，那就是新建的邮局，红色的砖墙和银色的字母磨得闪闪发亮。虽然斯特兰沃思小姐从来没有处心积虑地盘算如何寄信，但是她总是能选择好时机秘密地做这件事。当然，让大家看见她寄信是不明智的。因此，她计划好了散步的时间，正好能在天刚擦黑的时候到达邮局，这个时候天色能把树木的轮廓、人脸的模样变得暗淡模糊。但没人能把斯特兰沃思小姐搞错，因为从她优雅的走路的姿势和窸窣作响的裙摆就能一眼认出她。

邮局周围总有一群年轻人，其中岁数最小的孩子在马路上滑着旱冰，这条道路沿着邮局绕了一大圈，是镇上唯一平整的路。而岁数稍微大些的孩子已经知道三五成群地聚在一起聊天、嬉笑和激动地盘算着如何在一两分钟之内穿过街道跑到汽水店里了。斯特兰沃思小姐在孩子们面前从不会感到不自在。她不会感到他们当中有人会死盯着她看或者想嘲笑她。如果有父母胆敢允许他们的孩子嘲笑普莱桑特大街的斯特兰沃思小姐，那他一定会成为众矢之的。当斯特兰沃思小姐路过的时候，大多数的孩子都会很尊敬地退后站，在她面前短暂地停止嬉闹，而年纪大一些的孩子则跟她打着招呼，一本正经地问候道：“您好！斯特兰沃思小姐。”

斯特兰沃思小姐冲他们微笑着点点头，但很快又继续走下去。她知道镇上每个孩子的名字已经有很长时间了。邮筒就在邮局的门口，当斯特兰沃思小姐走近邮筒时，孩子们都站到了一边，他们似乎很吃惊地发现，在邮局晚上正式关门把门前的这块地移交给孩子们玩以后，竟然还有人想来邮局寄东西。斯特兰沃思小姐站在门边，打开了黑色的手提包拿出了信件，就在这时，她听见了一个声音，她立刻分辨出这是琳达·斯图尔特的声音，可怜的小琳达又哭了。斯特兰沃思小姐竖起耳朵仔细听着，毕竟这是她的镇子，这些人是她镇子上的人，任何一个人遇到了麻烦，她都应该知道。

“我不能告诉你，戴夫。”琳达哭诉道——不出斯特兰沃思小姐所料，她正在跟哈里斯家的男孩争吵——“我就是不能，真讨厌。”

“可是你爸爸为什么不让我去找你了？我究竟做了什么错事？”

“我不能告诉你，我什么都不会跟你说的，对待那样的事，你的思想太肮脏。”

“但是一定是出什么事了，你一直在哭，你的父亲也心烦意乱，我为什么不能知道呢？难道我不和你的家人一样吗？”

“不再是了，戴夫，再也不是了，你不能再靠近我们家了，我父亲是这么说的。他说会用马鞭子抽你。我所能告诉你的是：你不能再靠近我们家了。”

“但是我什么事也没做呀。”

“那还是一样，我父亲说了……”

斯特兰沃思小姐叹了口气，转过身去。人们的心中有那么多的邪恶。甚至像这样一个迷人的小镇，还是有那么多的邪恶在人们的心中。

她把信投进了邮筒，有两封信落到了里面，而第三封信卡到了投递口的边缘，落到了外面，就掉在斯特兰沃思小姐脚旁的地上，可她并没有注意到。因为她正在琢磨，无论给小伙子哈里斯的父亲写信与否，可能对于消除这个潜在的坏事都丝毫没有什么帮助。斯特兰沃思小姐疲惫地扭头回家了，想早一点儿回到她那可爱的房子里，静静地躺到床上，所以她根本没听见哈里斯家的男孩叫她的声音，告诉她她的东西掉了。

“老斯特兰沃思小姐耳朵变聋了。”他手里拿着刚捡起来的信件，望着她的身影说道。

“好了，谁在乎呢？”琳达说道，“不管怎么说，谁又能在乎呢？”

“是寄给唐·克瑞恩的，”哈里斯家的男孩说道，“这封信。她掉了一封信，是唐·克瑞恩家的地址，也许我可以把它直接捎给他，我们毕竟要路过他家。”他笑了，“也许这是张支票或者别的什么东西，如果他今天晚上就能得到它而不是等到明天，他可能会更开心。”

“碰到老斯特兰沃思小姐正给人寄支票，”琳达说道，“把它扔到邮筒里吧，干吗要自找麻烦？”她有点儿嗤之以鼻。“在我看来，我们的周围也没人在乎我们呀，”她说道，“为什么我们要帮他们的忙？”

“不管怎么说，这事就交给我了，”哈里斯家的男孩说道，“也许它对于他们一家来说是个好消息，也许他们今晚也需要点儿开心的事儿，就像我们。”

他们手牵着手，难过地沿着黑暗的街道慢慢向下走去，哈里斯家的男孩手里拿着斯特兰沃思小姐粉色的信封。

第二天一早，斯特兰沃思小姐一觉醒来，心中充满了强烈的幸福感，有那么一会儿，她还在纳闷自己为什么会有这种感觉。她突然记起了原来今天上午，三个人都会打开寄给他们的信件。也许，在一开始时，这信对他们来说有点儿不舒服，但是邪恶不会轻易地被消灭，一颗纯洁的心必是洗涤过的心。她洗了洗柔软、苍老的脸，刷了牙，尽管七十一岁了，她的身体依然不错。她仔细地穿上了一件芳香、柔软的衣服，扣紧了她的鞋。随后，她走到楼下，思忖着在充满阳光的餐厅，吃上一小块华夫饼作为早餐大概很合胃口。她发现门厅的地板上有封信，于是弯腰把它捡了起来。一份账单、一份晨报，还有一封装在绿色信封里的信，看上去有种莫名的熟悉感。斯特兰沃思小姐一动不动地在那儿站了好一会儿，低头看着用铅笔写着地址的绿色信封，心想：看上去怎么那么像我写的信呀，是其中一封信被退回来了吗？不会呀，因为没人知道信是从哪儿寄出的呀，那它怎么到了这儿的呢？

斯特兰沃思小姐毕竟是普莱桑特大街上的斯特兰沃思，当把信封打开时，她的手一点儿也没颤抖。她把里面的绿色信笺打开，开始了无声的哭泣，为这世界上的邪恶，因为她读到了这样一句话：小心你的那些玫瑰！

公共汽车


年老的哈珀小姐正要回家，晚上的天气又潮湿又恶劣。哈珀小姐无论什么时候都不喜欢旅行，尤其不喜欢坐又脏又小的公交车旅行，但这是她回家的唯一方式。她经常向公交公司投诉他们的服务，因为不论她想去哪儿，似乎都无法搭上一辆体面的公交车。从家里出来就够不方便的了——哈珀小姐喜欢向公交公司指出这一点——但是平安回到家里总是不太可能。今天晚上，哈珀小姐没有别的选择：如果她不乘这辆特定的公交车回家的话，她第二天也没法回去。恼怒、疲惫、沮丧，她生气地敲着小烟草店的柜台，这家烟草店还兼做公交车站。她心里正在想，该如何开始写她的投诉信：虽然我是个家庭经济条件并不好的老妇人，也不得不缩减我旅行的次数，但我还是想指出你们公交车的服务质量远远低于……

在外面，公交车发动机的噪音很响，很显然司机并不着急启程。哈珀小姐觉得她已经听到座位弹簧下陷，扭曲了形状，发出的令人厌倦的声音了。“我简直不能再出门旅行了，”哈珀小姐心想，“即使去看史蒂芬尼也不值得。”他们真的能让你在出门的路上感觉到不舒服。“我能买张票吗，拜托？”她尖声说道，柜台另一边的老头放下报纸，恶狠狠地看了她一眼。

哈珀小姐订了票，对自己怒气冲冲的声音感到震惊。而老头把票啪的一声摔在她面前的柜台上，说道：“公交车三分钟后离开。”

“他想告诉我，我会错过这班车的。”哈珀小姐心想。“但是，我必须得数清楚他找给我的零钱。”

大雨倾泻下来，哈珀小姐冒雨匆忙跑到公交车的车门口。司机慢慢地把车门打开。哈珀小姐爬上车后想：先生，我绝不会再坐贵公司的车旅行了，你们的售票员是那么的丑陋，你们的司机是那么的粗暴无礼，你们的车辆是那么的肮脏……

公交车上已经有几名乘客了，哈珀小姐很想知道他们可能的目的地。是不是这么多的小镇真的只通这趟公交车呀？是不是其他的人真的能忍受以这种旅行的方式去某地，甚至回家呀？“我是真的很难受，”哈珀小姐心想，“真是太难受了。对于我这个年龄的老太太来说，真是太折腾了。但是，我需要回家。”想到回家可以洗一个热水澡，喝上一杯茶，躺到自己的床上，她叹了口气。没人帮她把行李箱举到行李架上，她扭头看见司机正背对着她坐在那里，心里暗想，他可能更愿意她下车，而不想帮她一把。随后，她察觉到了自己有点儿心地不善，把人往歪处想，自己也笑了。公交车公司可能也会写上一封信来投诉我，她这样在心里告诉自己，觉得好多了。在去公交车站之前，幸亏她吃了一片安眠药，希望坐上车后尽可能在路途中睡觉。最后，她坐到了车后部的座位上，自我安慰旅途不会太难熬，用不了多久就能回家洗澡、喝茶了。在到家之前，还可以完成公交公司对投诉信的回复：女士，以您的经历和这么大的年纪，肯定应该知道一家资金短缺但诚实守信的小公司所面临的种种问题，我们只希望……

她知道公交车已经开动了，因为她在座位上大幅度地晃来晃去，甚至在她终于打起盹以后，脚底下那种叮叮咣咣的声音和震动的感觉还挥之不去。她很费劲地向后倒下去，把头靠在椅背上，随着公交车的晃动也前后摇晃。周围的乘客有的也在打盹，有的在小声说话，有的茫然地看着窗外飘洒的雨水和路过的灯光。

在打盹的过程中，哈珀小姐感觉到有人走向她身后的座位时挤了她一下，脑袋被碰了，连帽子都歪了。刚开始时，由于睡得迷迷糊糊，哈珀小姐有点儿发蒙，她用手抓着帽子，嘟囔着，“谁呀？”

“睡你的觉吧，”一个年轻人说道，然后咯咯地笑着，接着说，“我只是个从家里跑出来的人，仅此而已。”

哈珀小姐没有醒，但她略微把眼睛睁开了一条缝，抬头看了看公交车的车顶。“那是不对的，”哈珀小姐尽可能地用清晰的声音说道，“那是不对的，回家吧。”

又传来一阵咯咯的笑声，“太晚了，”那个声音回应道，“睡你的觉吧。”

哈珀小姐确实又睡着了。她睡得很不舒服，睡相也很不雅观，她的嘴巴微微张着。大约在一个小时以后，她的头又被人碰了一下，随之传来一个声音，“我觉得我要在这儿下车了，就现在。”

“你会后悔的，”哈珀小姐在梦中说道，“回去吧。”

又过了一会儿，公交车司机在试图摇醒她。“醒醒，女士，”他说道，“我不是闹钟，醒醒啦，该下车了。”

“什么？”哈珀小姐动了动身子，睁开了眼睛，下意识地摸了摸手提包。

“我可不是个闹钟，”司机说道，他的声音严厉而显得疲惫，“我不是闹钟，下车了。”

“什么？”哈珀小姐又说了一遍。

“到了你的目的地了，你买的车票就是到这儿的，你到了。我不是个闹钟来叫醒人们，告诉他们到了下车的时候了。你到站了，女士，其实叫你下车并不是我工作的职责，我不是……”

“我要投诉你。”哈珀小姐醒了以后说道。她伸手摸了摸她的手提包，发现它在膝头，然后又挪了挪双脚，正了正帽子。她坐得身子都僵硬了，挪动起来不容易。

“投诉我吧，但是到别处去投诉吧，我要开车了。现在是不是请你下车，我好继续赶路？”

他的声音很大，哈珀小姐很不舒服地注意到公交车上的很多乘客都在看着她，大家开口笑着，交头接耳地议论着。司机转过身，又大踏步地回到了司机座上，边走边说道：“她以为我是个闹钟。”哈珀小姐在没人搭把手的情况下，吃力地站起身，自己取下了行李箱，磕磕绊绊地在车厢过道里推着行李，行李碰到了过道边的座位，她知道人们正在盯着她，特别害怕自己会绊倒。

“我一定会投诉你。”她对着司机说道，而司机无所谓地耸了耸肩。

“快点儿吧，女士，”司机说道，“快半夜了，我还得继续开车呢。”

“你应该对自己的言行感到羞耻。”哈珀小姐狂乱地喊道，都快哭出来了。

“女士，”司机用一种煞费苦心的耐心说道，“请下车。”

车门开了，哈珀小姐站在车门口稍微缓了口气，行李放在陡直的车梯处。“她觉得别人是个闹钟，都会照料她下车。”司机在她身后说道。哈珀小姐站到了地面上，行李箱、手提包、手套、帽子，一样不少。刚才她正在车上收拾行李时，公交车猛地往前一冲，几乎把她甩到了后面。哈珀小姐这辈子第一次有了跑上前冲某人挥舞拳头的想法。“我要投诉他，”她心想，“我希望他丢掉饭碗。”就在这时，她意识到自己下错站了。

在黑暗和大雨中，哈珀小姐静静地站着，明白自己并非是在自己城镇的公交车站下的车，那辆公交车把她放错了地方。在大雨中，她站在一个空无一人的十字路口。这儿没有商店，没有灯光，没有出租车，没有人烟。实际上，什么也没有，只有脚下又湿又脏的路，以及一个岔路口的路标。“别慌，”哈珀小姐告诉自己，差不多是自言自语地说，“不要慌，没关系，没有关系，你会看到没什么大不了的，别害怕。”

她朝公交车开走的方向走了几步，但它已经不见了踪影，哈珀小姐用颤抖的声音喊道，“回来”，以及“救命”，但是她的那令人震惊的呼喊没有得到任何回应，而且除了雨还在持续地下，呼喊也渐渐淹没在雨声中了。“我的声音听上去那么苍老，”她心想，“可我不恐慌。”她转了个圈，手里还拿着行李箱，不断地告诉自己：不要慌张，没关系的。

视线中没有任何遮风避雨的地方，但是路标显示是“瑞克特兰丁”，哈珀小姐心想：这就是我所在的地方了，我现在来到瑞克特兰丁了，我不喜欢这儿。她把行李箱放到路标下，想努力看清脚下的道路。也许在雨幕中有一栋房屋，或者某类谷仓或者棚库，她可以去那儿躲雨。她一边迷茫和绝望地小声哭了起来，又一边嘀咕道：“拜托，不会有人来吗？”这时她影影绰绰地看到远方的道路上有车灯，才意识到真的有人过来帮助她了。她跑到道路的中央，站在那里挥舞着手臂，手套湿了，手提包也耷拉到了地上。“这儿，”她喊道，“我在这儿，拜托快过来，救救我。”

透过雨声，她能听见马达声，车的大灯照到了她。突然，她有点局促不安，当车灯照到她时，她用手提包挡住了脸。灯光来自一辆小卡车，车开过来猛地在她身边刹住了，挨着她的车窗摇了下来，传来一个男人怒气冲冲的声音，“你找死呀？你是想找死还是怎么的？你在马路中间站着干什么呢，不是在找死吗？”坐在副驾驶的年轻小伙子扭头对着司机说：“是个女人，竟然跑到路中间来了。”

“拜托，”哈珀小姐说道，她看见车窗似乎马上要摇上去了，“请帮帮我吧，公交车司机让我在这儿下车，可这儿不是我应该下车的车站，我迷路了。”

“迷路了？”年轻人哈哈大笑了起来，“我还是头一次听说有人能在瑞克特兰丁迷路，大多数人是费了很大劲儿也找不到这个地方。”他又笑了起来，而司机也从方向盘上侧过身子，好奇地看着哈珀小姐，也开口笑了起来。哈珀小姐赶紧赔着笑脸说道：“你能让我搭车到什么地方吗？也许是一个公交车站？”

“没有什么公交车站。”年轻人使劲摇了摇头，“公交车倒是每天晚上都会经过这儿，有乘客上下车才会停。”

“好吧，”哈珀小姐的声音不禁提高了，她突然担心会惹恼这两个年轻小伙子，也许他们会把她撂在原地，让她留在又潮湿又黑暗的雨夜里。“求你们了，”她说道，“能让我上车和你们坐在一起吗，免得在雨里挨淋？”

两个年轻人彼此对视了一下，“把她带到那个老妇人那儿吧。”其中一个说道。

“她浑身都湿透了，会把车里也弄湿的。”另一个年轻人说道。

“拜托，”哈珀小姐说道，“我会很高兴付给你们我所能支付得起的钱的。”

“我们会把你带到老妇人那里去的，”司机说道，“喂，往这边靠靠。”他对另一个年轻人说道。

“等等，我的行李箱。”哈珀小姐跑到了路标杆前，顾不上形象了，在雨中跌跌撞撞地拿着她的行李箱跑回了卡车那里。

“像个落汤鸡，”年轻人说道，他打开车门，从哈珀小姐的手中接过了行李箱。“我把它放到后面。”他一边说着，一边转过身把行李箱随手扔到了卡车后面。哈珀小姐听见湿漉漉的行李箱砰的一声落到了车后，心里想着她没打包好的那些东西会成什么样子。“我的那瓶古龙香水呀。”她绝望地想。“快进来，”年轻人说道，“我的上帝呀，你都湿透了。”

哈珀小姐以前从来没爬上过一辆卡车，再加上她的裙子很紧，手套沾满雨水很滑，显得笨手笨脚。在那个年轻人的帮助下，她单膝跪在高高的脚踏板上，连滚带爬地上去了。“这本不可能发生在我身上。”她的脑海中很清楚地闪过了这一念头。当哈珀小姐爬到紧挨着司机的座位上时，小伙子一脸严肃地发动了车，卡车缓缓地向前移动。

“你身上太湿了，”司机说道，一边把着方向盘，一边睥睨着哈珀小姐，“为什么你会被一个人扔在大雨中。”

“都怪那个公交车司机，”哈珀小姐开始剥掉她的手套，想方设法地要把身上弄干些，“他告诉我到站了。”

“应该是约翰尼·塔尔博特，”司机冲着另一个小伙子说道，“他开那辆公交车。”

“嗯，我要投诉他。”哈珀小姐说道。车里暂时出现了一阵沉默，然后司机又开口说道：“约翰尼是个不错的家伙呀，应该没什么问题。”

“他是个很坏的公交车司机。”哈珀小姐尖刻地说道。

卡车停了下来，“你不会真的想投诉老约翰尼吧。”司机说道。

“我当然要……”哈珀小姐话说到半截，又马上住嘴了。她心想：我在哪儿呢？在我身上发生了什么事？“呃，不会的，”她最后说道，“我不会投诉老约翰尼的。”

司机又开动了卡车，他们在泥泞和大雨中沿着道路缓慢地前进着。雨刷器在挡风玻璃上催人欲睡地来回刷着雨水，车头大灯射出一条狭窄的光柱。哈珀小姐心里在打着鼓：后面会在我身上发生什么事？她不安地动了动身子，她身边的年轻人生气地运了口气，往旁边侧了侧身子。“她像刚从水里捞上来的一样，”他对司机说道，“我也都湿了。”

“我们就快到老妇人那儿了，”司机说道，“她会知道怎么处理的。”

“什么老妇人呀？”哈珀小姐不敢再动身子了，甚至不敢侧过头去了，“前面有没有公交车站呀？或者出租车？”

“你可以，”司机考虑了一下说道，“你可以等着，直到赶上明天晚上经过的同一班公交车，也是约翰尼开的车。”

“我只想尽快回家。”哈珀小姐说道。卡车的座位特别难受，她觉得又湿又黏，而且透心凉，家似乎太遥远了，也许根本就不存在。

“沿着这条路大约有一英里远。”司机带着安慰的口气说道。

“我从来没听说过瑞克特兰丁这个地名，”哈珀小姐说道，“我无法想象他怎么会让我在这儿下车。”

“也许别人应该在这儿下车，他以为是你，搞错了。”这个推论似乎极度困扰着年轻人，因为他又说，“你瞧，本来应该在这儿下车的人换成了你。”

“那就是说，他仍然在公交车上。”司机说道，他们都沉默了，觉得很是恐慌。

他们前方有一盏灯在闪烁，在雨中隐约可见，司机指着它说：“那儿，那儿就是我们要去的地方。”车越开越近，哈珀小姐感觉到不断增加的焦虑。灯光似乎来自一栋公路边上的旅馆，哈珀小姐这辈子从来没进过一家公路旅馆。在黑夜里，房屋只露出了隐隐约约的形状，侧门的灯光照亮了一个悬挂着的歪歪扭扭的招牌，上面写着“啤酒吧＆烧烤”。

“还有别的我能去的地方吗？”哈珀小姐怯生生地问道，紧紧地抓着她的手提包，“我完全不能确定，你知道，我应该……”

“今天晚上这儿的人不是很多，”司机边说，边把卡车拐进了辅路，停在了一个停车场里，哈珀小姐难过地发现，这儿原来是个花园，“可能雨还在下。”

哈珀小姐透过车窗和雨幕凝视这个地方，突然觉得有种熟识的温暖和宾至如归的感觉。就是这栋房子，她心想。为什么我会对这栋房子有这种感觉，当然，这房子是可爱的。很显然，这栋房子一度是个古老的宅邸，建得坚固和别致，结构对称，风格属于古老时期的那种很好的房子。“为什么？”哈珀小姐问道，想搞明白这么好的房子怎么会在侧门上草草地安一盏灯，歪七扭八地悬挂着一个招牌，上面写着“啤酒吧＆烧烤”呢。“到底是为什么停在这儿呀？”哈珀小姐又问道。但司机回答道：“这儿就是你想去的地方，拿上她的行李箱。”他对另一个年轻人说道。

“进这里面？”哈珀小姐问道，为这么好的古屋都感到愤愤不平，“进这个酒吧里面？”为什么，我过去住在一栋和这房子差不多的楼里，她心里暗想。他们对我们的这些古屋都干了些什么呀？

司机小伙哈哈大笑着，“你安全了。”他说道。

拿着行李箱和手提包，哈珀小姐跟着两个年轻人走到亮灯的门口，路过了歪歪扭扭的招牌。她又思忖：真是丢人呀，他们甚至没有想到要花点儿心思保护一下这个地方。房子需要粉刷了，四周需要加固，也许还要换个新房顶。这时，司机小伙说道：“来吧，来吧。”他把厚重的大门推开了。

“我过去就住在一栋像这样的房子里。”哈珀小姐说道。两个年轻人哈哈大笑了起来。

“我相信你的话。”其中一个说道。哈珀小姐在门口停下了脚步，瞪大眼睛，意识到她刚才的话听上去是多么奇怪。这栋楼过去毫无疑问有着多个舒适的房间，高高的屋顶和四四方方的厅堂，大门很宽敞，地板擦得锃光瓦亮；而现在是个很大的脏兮兮的房间，沿着一边是一长条柜台，还有六张破旧的桌子。角落里有一台自动点唱机，地板上铺着磨破了的油毡。“哦，不。”哈珀小姐喊道。这个房间气味怪怪的，这时雨像鞭子一样打在空无一物的窗户上。

围在桌子边坐着的、站在自动点唱机四周的有十二个左右的年轻人，跟把哈珀小姐带到这儿的那两个年轻人差不多，所有人看上去都是一副稀奇古怪的样子，肆无忌惮地大声说笑着。哈珀小姐背靠着门站着，有一阵子她觉得他们正在嘲笑她。她全身湿透，垂头丧气，但这些喧闹的人跟这座古屋的氛围格格不入。这时，司机小伙转过身，用手势示意她，“过来见见那位年长的女士吧。”他说道，然后，对着大屋子喊道，“快看，我们给你带来了一个伴儿。”

“拜托。”哈珀小姐说道，但是根本没有人多瞥她一眼。她拿着行李箱和手提包，跟着两个年轻人走到了柜台前面。她的行李箱冲撞着自己的双腿，她想：我可不能摔倒。

“贝丽，贝丽，”司机小伙喊道，“来看看我们捡到的走失的猫。”

一个高大肥胖的女人正坐在柜台后面的座位上转着圈圈，她看了一眼哈珀小姐，然后上下打量着她，先看了看哈珀小姐的行李箱以及湿帽子和湿鞋子，又看了看哈珀小姐的手提包和捏在手中的手套。这个女人似乎很难转动一下眼珠，好像不费吹灰之力就把哈珀小姐吸引住了。“胡扯，”女人最后说道，她的声音出人意料的温柔，“胡扯。”

“她湿透了。”另一个年轻人说道。这两个年轻人分别站在哈珀小姐的两侧，介绍了她。高大的胖女人再次上上下下打量着哈珀小姐。“拜托。”哈珀小姐恳求道。至少这儿还有一个女人，她可能会理解和同情她。“拜托，他们在一个陌生的车站让我下了车，我找不到回家的路了，请帮帮我吧。”

“胡扯。”胖女人说道，然后又笑了，一种温情的笑。“她的确都湿透了。”她说道。

“求你了。”哈珀小姐说道。

“你会照料她吗？”司机问道。他转过身低头向哈珀小姐微笑着，显然在等着什么。哈珀小姐突然意识到了什么，在手提包里摸索着找钱包。多少钱？她想知道，但又不想开口问；虽然搭车的路途很短，但是如果没有搭车，我可能会得肺炎，到头来还得看病花钱。我已经得了感冒，她很清楚地意识到了这一点，从钱包中挑了两张五美元的钞票。给他们每人五美元就不会争吵了，她想着，打了个喷嚏。两个年轻人和高大的女人正饶有兴趣地看着她，他们都看见了，在哈珀小姐掏出两张五美元的钞票后，钱包里只剩下一张五美元和两张十美元的钞票了。所幸钱还没有湿，我想我还是应该心存感激的，哈珀小姐心想。她动作缓慢地把两张五美元的钞票分别递给了两个年轻人，也感觉到两人在她头顶互相递了个眼色。

“谢谢。”司机说道。我给他们每人一美元应该就够了，哈珀小姐想。“谢谢。”司机又说了一遍。另一个年轻人也说道：“呃，谢啦！”

“谢谢你们。”哈珀小姐很正式地说道。

“我今天晚上会给你提供住宿的，”女人说道，“你今晚可以睡在这里，明天出发。”她又上下打量了一遍哈珀小姐。“把自己弄干一些。”她说道。

“还有别的地方吗？”哈珀小姐话刚出口，又怕这样似乎不礼貌，于是解释道，“我的意思是，今天晚上我还能赶路吗？我不想给你添麻烦。”

“我们有房间出租，”女人把身子半扭向柜台，“每晚要十美元的房费。”

她还给我留了乘公交车回家的车费，哈珀小姐心里明白：我想我应该感谢她。“我最好，我想，”她说道，又掏出了钱包，“我的意思是，谢谢你。”

那个女人接过了钞票，把身子又转回了柜台。“楼上，”她说道，“你挑一间吧，目前还没什么住客。”她环顾了一下四周然后对哈珀小姐说道，“明天上午我会派人给你送一杯咖啡的，不喝咖啡我是不会放人出门的。”

“谢谢。”哈珀小姐知道楼梯的位置，她转身拿着行李箱和手提包，走到了过去作为前厅的地方，楼梯就在那儿，如此优美的比例让她屏住了呼吸。转回身去，她看见大个头的女人正在盯着她，于是说道：“我过去住的房子跟这个很像，我想建成的年代也一样。那些古老的有特点的建筑应该永久地保存下来，那儿的人们……”

“胡扯。”那个女人说道，转身回到了柜台里面。

年轻人三个一群五个一伙地分散在大房间的各个角落里聊着天。在一个角落里，一群人围着那两个把哈珀小姐带到这里来的年轻人，时不时地发出哈哈大笑。哈珀小姐被触动了，而且带着一些忧伤看着他们。这个又大又丑的房间一度是那么的美丽，她有种回到了家的感觉。这一定很好，她又想，如果能跟这些年轻人聊聊天，也许还可以成为他们的朋友，和他们一起谈天说地，大声欢笑。也许他们想知道现在聚会的地点以前是一位女士的起居室。迟疑了一下，哈珀小姐想知道是否应该对他们打招呼，“晚上好”，或者再说句“谢谢你们”，甚至说，“上帝保佑你们大家”。然而，因为没人注意她，她开始上楼了。走到楼梯一半的时候有一段平台，上方是镶嵌着彩色玻璃的窗户，哈珀小姐停下脚步，屏住了呼吸。在她小时候，她所住的楼房在楼梯平台处也有这样一个镶嵌着彩色玻璃的窗户，阳光透过窗户，照耀在楼梯上形成了一百种色彩，如同童话里的颜色。哈珀小姐回忆着，同时又在深思：我想弄明白现在我们为什么不住在这样的房子里了。我很孤独。哈珀小姐默默想着，接着又转念一想：我必须脱下这些湿衣服了，我真的得了感冒。

未加思索，她走到楼梯的顶端转了个弯，到了左手的第一间屋子，那里一直是她房间的位置。房门是开着的，她往里瞟了一眼，显然这是一间等待出租的卧室，布置得丑陋、单调和廉价。灯的开关是悬挂在门边的灯绳，哈珀小姐在门口站住了，看着剥落的墙纸和下陷的地板感到悲哀。他们对这栋房子做了什么？她心想：我今天晚上怎么能睡在这里呢。

最后，她挪动了脚步，进入房间把行李箱放到了床上。“我必须把自己弄干，”她告诉自己，“我必须充分地利用好这些东西。”床的位置不错，放在了两个正面的窗户之间，但是床垫又硬又凹凸不平。让哈珀小姐感到惊恐的是它的酸臭味和嘎吱作响的弹簧。我不要考虑这些事情，哈珀小姐想，我不会让自己老想着这些事情。这间屋子可能就是我小的时候睡觉的地方，窗户的位置几乎一模一样——正面两扇窗户，侧面两扇窗户——门的位置也正确。他们是怎么把这些古老的建筑都修建成了四四方方样式的，哈珀小姐琢磨着；他们是怎么把它们都建在了一起的，在整个乡村地区跟这房子建的样式完全一样的房屋有一千多栋。但是，壁橱的位置不对，结构上有些奇怪，当哈珀小姐坐在床上时，却发现壁橱在她的右边。在她是个小姑娘时，大壁橱一直是她玩耍的地方，也是藏身之所，但是是在左边。

卫生间的位置也不对，不过那不重要。哈珀小姐在睡觉之前曾经非常渴望泡在热澡盆中，但是当她看到澡盆的模样时，沮丧地打消了念头，她想还是等到回家后再说吧。她洗了脸和手，温暖的水让她感到很舒服，而她发现行李箱中的那瓶古龙香水竟然安然无恙，里面所有东西都没有被打湿则更让她觉得舒心，至少她能穿着干的睡衣入睡了，即使床铺很冰冷。

躺在冷冰冰的床单上，她又浑身打起哆嗦来了，让她想到小时候睡的床。她躺在黑暗中，眼睛睁着，想搞明白最后她到了哪里，是怎么来到这儿的：最开始是坐公交车，然后是坐卡车，而现在她正躺在黑暗中，没人知道她在哪里，或者她会变成什么样子。她只带了一个行李箱，手提包里只有一点儿钱，她不知道自己身在何处。她很疲惫，心想也许早些时候吃的安眠药的药劲儿还没完全过去；也许是安眠药一直在影响着她的一言一行，因为无论被带到哪里，她都很驯服和茫然。她迷迷糊糊地告诫自己：明天早上，我会向他们表现出我自己能做自己的决定。

楼下自动点唱机的喧嚣和年轻人的笑声渐渐小了，变成了远方传来的轻柔的曲调。“我妈妈正在起居室里唱歌，”哈珀小姐心想，“周围的人正坐在小硬板凳上听着。我爸爸正在弹钢琴。”她分不太清妈妈唱的是哪首歌，但肯定是她听妈妈唱过很多次的那首歌。我能蹑手蹑脚地出去到楼梯上仔细听。她正想着，这时察觉到壁橱里有窸窸窣窣的声音，但是壁橱在错误的位置上，在右边而不在左边。声音变得大起来，成了咔嗒咔嗒声，哈珀小姐想，但她想听妈妈唱歌；壁橱里的声音好像是木制的什么东西在四下晃动。我要不要从床上爬起来让壁橱安静下来，好让我能听唱歌呢？我是不是太暖和太舒服了？我是不是太困了？

虽然壁橱在错误的位置上，但是咔嗒咔嗒声还在持续，声音大得让人心生怒火，到了最后，她知道除非这声音停了，否则她无法入睡。哈珀小姐在床的一侧使劲摇晃着双腿，在困倦中，提醒着自己要去右边而不是左边，她赤脚走到壁橱的门前。

“你们在里面搞什么名堂呢？”她大声问道，然后一把拉开了门。刚好有足够的光线让她看清那是个木制的玩具蛇，头高高立着，它在其他玩具中扭动着身子，发出咔嗒声。哈珀小姐笑了，“那是我的蛇，”她大声说道，“是我过去的蛇，它活了。”在壁橱的后面，她还看见了她旧的玩具小丑，活泼开朗，当她仔细观察的时候，如同被施加了魔法，玩具小丑慵懒地前后摆动着，也活了过来。在哈珀小姐脚下，玩具蛇盲目地移动着，哐啷哐啷地冲撞着人偶屋；在里面，微型小人们也骚动着，撞击着一套积木，积木轰然倒塌。这时，哈珀小姐看见一个大个的美丽人偶正坐在一把小椅子上，她有着长长的金色鬈发，宽宽的睫毛下是蓝色的眼睛，穿着一条呆板的蝉翼纱派对长裙。当哈珀小姐怀着喜悦的心情伸出手去，人偶睁开了眼睛，站了起来。

“罗萨贝尔，”哈珀小姐叫出了声，“罗萨贝尔，是我。”

人偶转过身，睁大眼睛看着她，露出虚假的微笑。红色的嘴唇张开，发出骇人的呱呱声，从那张漂亮的嘴里还冒出了平淡的连珠炮似的声音，“走开，老太太，”人偶说道，“走开，老太太，走开。”

哈珀小姐往后退了一步，瞪大了眼睛。玩具小丑一边一会儿跌跌撞撞，一会儿手舞足蹈，一边还冲哈珀小姐做着鬼脸；玩具蛇恶狠狠地把她的没有眼睛的蛇头扔到了她的脚踝上，而那个人偶转动着身子，双手拉着裙子，嘴一张一合，“走开，”她呱呱叫着，“走开，老太太，走开。”

壁橱里面的所有东西都活了，一个小人偶疯狂地从一边跑到另一边，动物们列队庄严地从诺亚方舟的跳板上走下来，一个玩具熊像患了哮喘病一样呼哧呼哧喘着气。喧闹声越来越大，这时哈珀小姐才意识到它们都在恶狠狠地看着她，并向她逼近过来。人偶喊着“老太太，老太太。”便冲了上来。哈珀小姐砰的一声把壁橱门关上了，人依靠在了门上。在她的身后，蛇在冲撞着门，人偶的声音一遍又一遍地响着。哈珀小姐哭喊了起来，转身欲逃，但是壁橱是在错误的位置上，她逃跑的路也就错了，她发现自己正蜷缩在远处的墙边，而门离得出奇的远。这时壁橱的门慢慢打开了，人偶的脸上挂着微笑，正在四处寻找她。

哈珀小姐不顾一切地逃命，根本没有停下来看看后面的念头，她猛地跑出房间，穿过房门，一路奔下宽阔的、可爱的楼梯，来到门厅。“妈妈，”她尖声叫着，“妈妈，妈妈。”

她嘶喊着逃出了大门，“妈妈，”她哭叫着，然后跌了下去，沉入了无边的黑暗，一边转身想拼命抓住某件坚固和真实的东西，一边哭喊着。

“喂，女士，”公交车司机说道，“我可不是一个闹钟，快醒醒，该下车了。”

“你会后悔的。”哈珀小姐很清楚地说道。

“醒醒，”他说道，“醒醒了，下车了。”

“我要去投诉你。”哈珀小姐说道。手提包、手套、帽子、行李箱一样不少。

“我肯定要投诉你。”她几乎哭喊着说道。

“这是你的目的地了。”司机说道。

公交车猛地一动，开走了，而哈珀小姐在倾盆大雨中差一点儿摔倒，她的行李箱在她脚旁，身边是个路标，上面写着“瑞克特兰丁”。





跟我来


1


我一直坚信，只要能吃，就一定要吃。我下火车时，身上有很多钱，但没有名字。即使我已经在餐车上吃过午餐了，但我还是喜欢这样的念头——停下来喝杯咖啡，再吃个炸面圈，在吃东西的时候来决定我打算走哪条路，或者别人期望我走哪条路。我坚信，在面临道路选择时需要考虑清楚，然而我同时也认为在限定的时间里，万事都考虑得很清楚也不太现实。我带着很多钱下了火车，我需要一个名字，也需要一个目的地。至于说快乐、激动和我所知道的最大程度的愉悦，我倒是可以随时自娱自乐。

在火车站，有个女人对我说：“我姐姐想把一个房间租给一位善良的女士。她有一个腿有残疾的小孩子。”

我兴许可以利用上这个瘸腿的小孩子，我心想。于是我问道：“你姐姐住在哪儿，亲爱的？”

我要寻找最大程度的愉悦，我觉得你能理解我，我实际上什么都不缺。

我把房子卖了，赚了不少钱。我曾经举行休伊的葬礼——我的上帝，他是个蹩脚的画家——从谷仓——那儿是他的工作室，乱七八糟的——到家里来回一千零三次。我的年龄和尺码——都是四十四，不怕一万就怕万一，这些信息绝对有必要知道。——我正带着那些画作和完成一半的画布（“有一幅是艺术家在他去世当天上午所画。”它和其他的画作一样蹩脚；甚至回光返照的那一刻都帮不了休伊。）还有一些书、几盒子信件、装着其他东西的硬纸盒，还有休伊攒下的几盒东西，他的旧的舞蹈节目单、结婚证、扇子，诸如此类的东西。所有的东西我都深恶痛绝，不想再见，我向你保证。但是我不敢扔掉任何东西，害怕休伊有朝一日突然问起来，这种事时不时地发生，有一次他竟然想找一九四六年的某件东西，所有他有可能会找的东西都放进了那个谷仓，从家到那儿来回走过一千零三次的谷仓。

我不是个铁石心肠的人，休伊认识的人当中没人认为我实际，但是我等待的时间已经够长了。我知道我可以卖了这房子，家具都处理了出去，我觉得这挺滑稽。他们来到拍卖场，那些我认识多年的人，那些曾经参加葬礼的人，那些曾经坐在椅子上，在我们家餐厅大吃大喝，有时还会喝得烂醉，躺在我们家床上的人。如果他们来拍卖场的动机被发现，他们就会说类似这样的话：“我买了你的小枫木书桌，如果你想要回去，随时都可以。”“听着，我们挑了银器，但是它们不是私人的东西。”“你知道这架钢琴找到了好人家。”还有“我们今天和你一起哀悼”。——不对，这句话是他们在葬礼上说的。不管怎么说，但凡我认识多年的人都来到了拍卖场，那些有胆量的人过来跟我说话，有时能感到他们碰到我时多少有些尴尬，因为他们正在那儿窥探我家沙发底下的弹簧，有时根本对我视而不见。这真无耻，因为他们已经得到了想要的东西。我听见一个女人——当然没有名字，没人有名字——对另一个女人说，餐厅的橱柜在我手里可算是糟蹋了，这句话倒是真的，我只是保存着它，因为我怕我死去的祖母会回来要它。实际上，几乎所有的东西都被我糟蹋了，那也是休伊的想法。“你出身于一个那么好的家庭，”他过去常常对我说，“你们家的人都那么有教养，有文化，好好想想吧。”

所以，那就是我一开始做的事。我当然想了很长时间了——并不是我确信我会埋葬休伊，他活得很好——一切都按照我料想的进行。我卖了房子，拍卖了家具，把所有的画作和盒子都放到了谷仓里，我涂抹掉了所有东西上我的旧名字，把姓名的首字母也抹掉了，然后乘上火车离开了。

我不能说我真的选择了要去的城市，事实上，它是我目前唯一真正能找到的地方。我从来没去过那儿，但似乎城市的大小符合我的要求，而我兜里又有足够的钱买到去那儿的车票。当我从火车上下来，深深地吸了一口这个城市肮脏的空气，拿着我的行李箱、手袋和皮毛披肩——休伊并不自私，我不想给大家一个错误的印象，我总能得到我想要的一切——在柜台处停下来买咖啡和炸面圈。

“我姐姐想把一个房间租给一位善良的女士，”这个女人对我说道，“她带着一个瘸腿的孩子。”

于是我问道：“你姐姐住在哪儿，亲爱的？”

你知道，这就是这个城市里我第一个要去的方向——斯密斯大街。这就是我将要生活一段时间的地方。

这座城市很漂亮，尤其是在乡下生活多年后更感到如此。当然，我实际上并不反感树木和草地，但是休伊总是想住在乡下。这座城市的某处有个动物园，还有一所大学、几家大商场，还有有轨电车，我认为你现在不会经常见到这种交通工具了。我知道还有一个美术馆——要嫁给休伊这位画家的人，难道会不了解一个美术馆？——还有一个交响乐团，当然还有一些话剧团体，大部分演出的都是家庭主妇和仙女的故事。如果我喜欢这座城市，要留下来的话，我可能会去看这些话剧。这儿还有一个艺术影院。我希望至少还要有一家好的餐馆。我可是个一流的厨师。

我最渴望做的，不是别的什么事，不是去艺术影院或参观动物园，我想跟人聊天，我渴望遇见陌生人。于是我开始和火车站咖啡馆柜台前的那个女人搭起话来。

“她带着一个瘸腿的孩子。”

“你姐姐住在哪儿，亲爱的？”

“她嫁给一个男人已经有二十七年了，而他留给她的只是那栋房子和小儿子，那孩子还是个瘸子。我嘛，我不喜欢那样的男人。”

“他们不会给你留下太多东西的，就这么回事儿。”

“嫁给一个男人二十七年了，她本不应该自己去招揽房客的。”

“但如果她能租给我一个房间的话，那挺值得的。”

“我正要去探望我姐姐。”她放下了咖啡杯，“我去她家看她，然后再乘火车回自己家。你得乘这趟从我家到她家的火车。”她认真地看着我，好像很好奇我是否能记得自己的名字。“她住在史密斯大街上，你会认出那栋房子的，很大，她还挂了个招牌——房间出租。”

“至少他还给她留了一栋大房子。”我说道。

“整天楼上楼下忙活，现在还要打理这么一栋大房子，她也不再年轻了，而且还有个孩子。”

“好吧，我们都不是这样。”我说道。

在这次谈话之后，我还跟街角的一位男士说过话，当时他正在等有轨电车。“这趟电车是开往史密斯大街的吗？”我问他。

“什么电车？”他转过身，看着大街两侧。

“就是你正在等的这趟有轨电车呀，这是一个车站，不是吗？”

他又四处看了一下。然后，我们俩一起对这座城市的乐事感到好奇，你站在街的一角，有轨电车就会过来。“你说的是哪儿？”他问我。

“史密斯大街。”

“你住那儿？”

“是的。我有一个瘸腿的孩子，一栋大房子。”

“不对，”他说道，“你坐的车在街对面，因为对面的车才能去你说的方向。你住那儿有多久了？”

“二十七年了，和同一个男人。”

“他坐有轨电车应该比你更有经验吧？”

“他是个司机，”我告诉他，“我要试着避开他的路线。”

对他来说这话听上去显然合情合理。“女人们总是爱调查。”他说道，转身从我身边走开了。

然后，我又和书店里的一位老妇人搭上了话。她看上去很疲惫，我们交谈时，她把胳膊肘倚到几摞书上。她跟我说这个城市对书籍来说就是地狱，因为那所大学，学生们一年要偷一千多本平装书。“他们似乎不把它们当书看待，”她生气地说，“他们现在不敢偷了，因为封面里装了磁条。而且他们也知道我在盯着。”

“你卖了很多书吗？”

“正是这所大学，”她说道，“他们来这儿接受教育。”她兴奋地大笑着。“没人再说英语了。”她说道。她从那摞书上直起身子，走回书店的后面，坐在一把脏兮兮的旧椅子上。“我在盯着他们呢，”她喊出了声，“我还在盯着他们呢。”但是我打算离开了。

我走到往史密斯大街那个方向的街道一边，放下我的行李，拿着我的手袋和皮毛披肩等着有轨电车，过来一辆电车，上面写着史密斯大街。我知道这趟车肯定就是他们告诉我的开往史密斯大街的有轨电车。我把行李抬了上去，从后面爬进了车里。你知道，他们明明知道老太太——当然不是我——还有残疾的小孩、怀孕的妇女，也许还有胳膊断了的病人，都得坐有轨电车，可你会觉得他们并不想拉这些乘客，从他们开车的方式上就可以看出这一点。我想他们付给司机的薪水可能少得可怜，使得司机不愿帮助他人。他看着我，坐在驾驶座上开着他的电车，我不得不拿着我的行李箱、手袋、皮毛披肩连滚带爬地上了车，我估摸他不打算帮我，所以我想让他也不省心，于是问道：“这电车到史密斯大街吗？”

他看着我，我必须说他这样看着我会让我更高兴的。很多时候，人们似乎害怕发现其他人的真面目，好像如果你诚实地直视一个陌生人，你可能就会发现自己了解到了某些实际上并不想知道的事。“女士，”他说道，“我向你保证，这趟有轨电车每次都会在史密斯大街停靠。那就是为什么，”他说道，但是没有笑，“那就是为什么车头上会打出这样的字来。”

“你确定吗？”我也没笑，他知道这次遇到了和他一样爱抬杠的人，于是退缩了。

“是的，女士，”他说道，“我确定。”

“谢谢你。”我说道。显然像这样让一分钟溜走，多说上一个字，绝不会得到分毫报酬。我可能不会再见到那个司机了，但是从另一方面看，我又可能会住在史密斯大街上，每天晚上都可能坐他开的车回家。他可能叫我的名字，无论最后我给自己挑个什么名字，我可能每天晚上都会和他聊天，问他妻子今天的哮喘怎么样了，他女儿和那个偷钱的家伙一刀两断了没有。我还可能每天晚上问他：“喂，师傅，这趟电车到史密斯大街吗？”

每天晚上都如此，他可能会说，而且不带丝毫笑容，“是的，女士，肯定到。”

休伊会认为那没有什么好笑的。万一哪天他回来了问起这事，我当然要记住不要告诉他。

对有轨电车来说，有某种约束它们撒欢的办法。它们大摇大摆地过来，好像还没有完全适应轨道，我们也不知道是轨道停留在这儿，还是有轨电车在这儿停留在轨道上。它们晃动着，踉跄着，让乘客东倒西歪，尤其是那些设法拿着行李、手袋和皮毛披肩的乘客。我坐在座位上不断地滑跌，想知道是不是有人在嘲笑我，抑或是坐有轨电车本来就这样。窗外城市的景色在掠过，我看见了城里最大的商场，心想我很快会找一天去逛逛的，我可能会说：“好吧，如果你们没有四十四码的衬衫，我会跑到街对面的商场去，看看那儿有没有。”在我可以在任何地方开设任何收费账户之前，我得有个名字呀。“我宁愿你不要带钱，”休伊过去常常对我说，“我想让你进一家商店，挑选你想要的一切东西，告诉他们你的名字，然后扬长而去。我不在乎你是不是花了一千美元，只需告诉他们你的名字，拿上你喜欢的东西即可。”那儿还有很多宾馆。我可能有朝一日会回来探访一番，来看看我住在史密斯大街上的所有老朋友；我可能去辉煌宾馆参加一个茶舞(1)，虽然挑出遮篷里会丢失一封邀请函；我还可能在皇家宾馆的大堂里落个脚，去听听谁的名字能被呼叫到，然后从中挑一个名字。我看见一家药店，在那儿我可以让人给我开药方，或者买洗发水。我还看见一家可以买唱片的商店，还有一个可以修理鞋的地方，还有一家洗衣房、糖果店、杂货店、皮具店、宠物店和玩具店。这是一座很不错的小城市，合适得体，设施完善，完全能满足我的个人需要，适合善良的好人居住，它好像在等待我的到来。我在有轨电车上东倒西歪，心里想着他们已经做得很好了。

我必须说还是司机说了算。当他回过头冲我大喊时，我仍然在看着窗外，“史密斯大街到了。”为了避免让人误解他在对哪位乘客喊叫，他用手指着我。

“你妻子的哮喘怎么样了？”当我拿着行李箱、手袋、皮毛披肩沿着过道走过来的时候，我向他问道。

“好多了，谢谢你，”他说道，“小心台阶。”

是史密斯大街没错，没人骗我。他们都想确保我能按照计划到这儿，街角有一块路标，清清楚楚地写着“史密斯大街”。

我很高兴看到那儿有很多树，在远处，街的尽头，我能看见那儿像个小公园，沿着史密斯大街两侧一直到公园有很多树。我想，在这些树下我会很开心地回家，无论是在雨中，还是在秋天落叶纷飞的时候。我想我会很开心地听到树叶拂过窗户的飒飒声。这栋房子不知谁人建造，但至少已经度过了二十七年的安好岁月，高大宽敞，住在这里的人喜欢坐在前廊，看着自己的邻居们。那里有草坪、灌木丛、花园中浇水的软管，还有好几条狗。我想要租的房子在我的右手边，大约在这个街区的中间位置。虽然我没看见任何瘸腿的孩子，但是能看见这个大房子有个招牌，上面写着“房间出租”。我站在街的对面端详了房子好一阵子。到了，我心想，我到了。

任何时间，任何地点，没有任何人告诉我任何我可以去任何别的地方的话，这就是我唯一的目标。如果我没到这儿，他们也不会告诉我去别的地方。我很好奇哪个房间会是我的，在房间里我是否可以从窗户那儿往下看到大街上的景象，看到我自己正站在那儿往上观望和等待的地方。到了我往窗外看的时候，我应该有名字了。

然后我希望我能坐一会儿，也许可以找点儿东西吃。没有什么比一个四十四岁的女人，站在辅路上，拿着行李箱、手袋和皮毛披肩试图为自己想一个名字看上去更傻乎乎的了。这时，在街下面的某处，我听见有人呼唤一条狗，正在叫：“到这儿来，罗孚。”我觉得罗孚或许是个好名字，但不是我真正要寻找的名字。我想我兴许可以拦下路过的人，问他们的名字，但是没人想把自己的名字说出去，保留自己的名字极其重要，哪怕他们告诉了我他们的名字，我可能也没办法拼写下来，甚至没法正确地发音。如果你有了自己的名字，你就能够大声地说出来。我想过劳拉这个名字，但是劳拉是我母亲的名字。我不想再要休伊的任何东西了，包括他的姓氏。贝塔是我的祖母，她想叫贝塔，她的祖母也叫这个名字，她不也就叫了吗？我还想过叫缪丽尔(2)，但是听上去就像某人在小巷里被强奸和被抢劫了。我曾经养过一只猫，叫爱德华，因为它是银色的，我把它的名字改成了斯塔盖泽，接着在春天又改成了罗宾，我很快就厌倦了一只名叫罗宾的猫，随后又设法把它的名字重新改回爱德华，然后它得了病，死掉了。对于名字你得千万小心，一个人有太多的名字，最终你会失去他的。

我还想过简、海伦和玛格丽特，我知道很多人叫这些名字，也许会有人这么叫我，我还不喜欢答应呢。我也想过叫格特鲁德、贡纳莉，我也想过叫戴安娜，叫这个名字就大错特错了；还有弥涅尔瓦(3)，这个比较靠谱，但是听起来挺傻气。我知道我必须马上把这件事考虑清楚，我觉得脖子后面有点儿发凉。还有什么事比没有名字更可怕呢？没法称呼你自己，当他们问你你是谁时，你应该无话可说吧？突然我灵光一现，我听见了：安吉拉。就是它了，安吉拉就是我千辛万苦寻求来的名字。

剩下的事就好办了，我已经有了名字：安吉拉·摩妥尔曼(4)。安吉拉·摩妥尔曼太太。

于是安吉拉·摩妥尔曼太太缓慢而优雅地走上了通往这栋体面的老楼的小道，在它的窗户上有一个招牌，上面写着“房间出租”。她正拿着行李箱、手袋、皮毛披肩，停下了脚步，花了一小会儿时间非常仔细地观察着房子。一位女士必须小心提防自己周围的人，也必须小心选择居住的地方。当她把脚踏在台阶上，挺了挺胸，深深地吸了口气：安吉拉·摩妥尔曼太太，开天辟地以来的第一人。

我必须说她有很好的判断力，一发现我是她妹妹的朋友，就马上给我倒了杯茶。倘若你还奇怪我在火车上吃了午餐，在车站又喝了咖啡，吃了面包圈，现在又在这儿喝咖啡、吃小点心了，我只是想说我还有胃口把它们全都一扫而光。

“您是做哪行的，摩妥尔曼太太？”她问我。

“我涉足的领域是超自然。”我告诉她。

她的名字是弗恩太太；我们俩都有名字。“我妹妹怎么样？”她想知道。

“干得不错，”我说道，“当然，跟我们所有人一样，她也有她的麻烦。”

我立即被带到了房子里。我对大多数的房子都很喜欢，但这栋房子是我最喜欢的。楼梯不错，很宽，但每天上百次的上上下下踩踏，显然已经磨损了。上上下下，上上下下，直到失足跌落。房子很坚固，极难清洁，但它已经准备永远矗立在那儿了。住在这里的人足够多，使得气氛很活跃。我准备好了很多人会过来问这问那，但我首先得应付好弗恩太太。

“我刚刚埋葬了我丈夫。”我说道。

“我也刚刚埋葬了我丈夫。”她说道。

“难道不是种解脱吗？”我说道。

“什么？”她说道。

“那是个让人难过的场合。”我说道。

“你是对的，”她说道，“是一种解脱。”

她有一个尖下巴，她端上一杯浓茶来，我不能再说一位把自制的甜点心拿出来给客人的女人的坏话了。我自己也是个厨艺高超的人。茶是在厨房里提供的，我刚开口说我是她妹妹的朋友，她就很快地说：“我刚好想喝杯茶，到厨房来吧。”这话说得很合时宜。

当我第一次说出我名字的时候，实际上我无法确认它听上去是怎样的效果，因为在这个地球上，有史以来没人叫过它，我暗自想，我正在重获新生。“我是摩妥尔曼太太。”我说。

“我是弗恩太太，”她马上回应道，“我刚好想喝杯茶。”

我想弗恩太太和我一定会相处得很好的。我还不知道她是否爱傻笑，还是老爱用手指敲击桌子，但是我喜欢她的厨房，虽然里面没什么小装置；我还喜欢她的炉子，因为刚做完甜点心，炉子还热乎呢；我也喜欢她的下巴。

“我没说我想要一个房间，我也没说我不要，”我告诉她，“但如果我想要，你有什么房间给我看看呢？”

“我没说我有一个房间，我也没说我没有，”她马上回应道，“但是如果你想看看，我可以让你看一个很漂亮的小房间。”

哦，我一定会和弗恩太太相处得很好的。我喜欢她的下巴，喜欢她的炉子，喜欢她的房子。如果她想要一个瘸腿的小孩，我当然不会拦着她的。“女人一个人过太不容易了。”我说道。

“您是做哪行的，摩妥尔曼太太？”

“我涉足的领域是超自然。”

“我的外甥女得了脊膜炎，”她说道，好像我问了与此相关的问题一样。“让我给你续杯吧。她得了脊膜炎，病毒已经进到了心脏。当然，他们知道就是这样的结果，但他们从没有告诉她。在她发现它已经进入心脏之前，她已经得了这病好多年了。”

“我表弟得的是汞中毒，”我说道，“当然，毒性也直接进到了心脏。大约三天后他就死了。”

“我有个表妹也有类似的遭遇，”她说，“你提到的他们还有短暂的存活时间。只是她的情况更糟，毒性进到了脑子里了。那是我所见过的最红的脸，她死时都不认识我们了。”

“我婶婶也一模一样，”我说道，“只是她死于急性肺炎。那种病死得很快，在没有任何征兆的情况下就会染上，病人浑身肿胀，然后就一命归西了。”

“浮肿，”她说道，“跟我的侄子一样，只不过他是酒精中毒。”

“还有我的一个朋友，”我说道，“她得了头皮硬化症，他们不知道有什么好的办法治疗这种病，你知道。他们整天穿刺病人，我讨厌想起我朋友直到死还要忍受种种痛苦。”

“通常情况下死是最好的解脱，”她说道，“我也有一个朋友，我们都不能干等着，让她离开，可她得的是癌症，治不了。”

“我也有一个得癌症的朋友，”我说道，“但是他们把她的右腿锯掉了。”

“那还不够呢，”她说道，“听我说，她起码还剩了一条腿。我知道有个女人一次就被锯掉了两条胳膊。”

“我叔叔被一个卡车从身上碾压过去。”我说道。我还琢磨是否应该告诉她我姑姥姥的事。

“我对你叔叔的事感到很难过，”她说道，“你想租个房间，还是不租呢？”

“我租。”

“您是做哪行的，摩妥尔曼太太？”

“我涉足的领域是超自然。在人和鬼魂之间搭建沟通渠道。比如降神会、信息、精神治疗，诸如此类的事情。”

“我以前从来没听说过这类事，”弗恩太太说道，“我倒不是说我没有这种需要。出租房屋，有时也能收获惊喜。”

“我以前从来没在楼房里住过。”

“你不会觉得有什么特不方便的，”她说道，脸上没带一丝笑容，“你要做的就是定期付租金就行了。一日三餐也可以跟我们一块儿吃，但那得另付费用。”

“也许做饭时我能搭把手，我的厨艺不错。”

“我不能确定是否需要帮忙，但吃饭是要另交费用的，”她说道，“你不能在自己的房间里做饭。”

“我保证不做。”我说道。

“你不能在床上吸烟。”

“我保证不吸。”

“你不能在大晚上闹出很大动静。”

“我保证。”

“这些都是保障安全的预防措施，”她向我解释道，“你不会……我的意思是，你不能养那些肮脏的宠物。”

“保证不会。”

“虽然我一会儿带你看的房间有你自己的浴室，但你不能传播传染病什么的。我提供全套的亚麻制床上用品，大件换洗的东西也不用你动手，但是任何提神的东西——比如酒一类你自己要收好。”

哦，我喜欢弗恩太太。她突然转过头，然后又站了起来，走到厨房的后门，这门通向外面，她打开了它。“今天稍微早了点儿，”她说道，然后又说，“一定是一路跑回来的。”这句话显然属于某种私下里说的玩笑话，因为随即传来一阵笑声。我自己伸手又拿了一块小点心。这时，弗恩太太推着轮椅回来了。房门外面有个缓坡，所以把轮椅推进来不费什么力气。“这是我儿子汤姆，”弗恩太太说道，“汤姆，这位是摩妥尔曼太太。”再一次，这名字听上去挺不错，我要学会适应它。

“您好。”轮椅中的男孩说道。虽然对一个坐着的男孩的年龄做出准确判断有点儿困难，但可以看出他大约十二岁。“还有小点心吗？”

“我把我那份吃完了，”我说道，“如果你想吃的话，找时间我给你做一个特殊的巧克力蛋糕，有五层呢。”

“好的。”他说道，随后又笑了起来。“摩妥尔曼是个好笑的姓氏呀。”他说道。

“我瞎编的。”我告诉他，“你是刚从学校回到家？”

“我喜欢学校，”他说道，“但是他们总是吃惊我并不很聪明，因为我不打棒球一类的东西，他们总以为我会比别人更聪明。可实际上并不是这样。”

“如果你坚持练习，也许你会的。”我说道。

“每天早上，有个孩子推着我沿着大街去学校，下午另一个孩子把我推回家。他们推着轮椅，我掌控方向，感觉很好，但是我并不比别人像他们认为的那样聪明。”

“你要变得更聪明点儿是为了你自己好。”弗恩太太说道。她给他拿了一杯牛奶，把盛小点心的盘子往他跟前推了推。“我去检查一下你的房间。”她对我说道。

“我很聪明了，”他有点儿焦虑地对我说道，“当然了，我不笨。”

“我很聪明，但是我从来没有让别人推着我上下学。”

“嗯，我打算成为一名学者，我最好尽快开始。你会西班牙语吗？”

“不会。”

“我想学西班牙语、法语、意大利语、俄语，还有拉丁语和希腊语，成为一名学者。可目前为止我只会一点儿西班牙语，我挺懒的。”

“找上那么一天，我或许可以推你去看电影。”我说道。

“我喜欢这主意，”他说道，“也许一部西班牙语或者法语的电影能提高我的发音水平呢。”

我们俩又吃了一块小点心。然后，他说道：“你是研究什么的，摩妥尔曼太太？”

“我以前嫁给了一个画家。”

“他很棒吗？”

“不，他很蹩脚。”

“他死了吗？”

“是的。”

“你觉得我在开始学习法语之前还得继续学习多长时间的西班牙语？这两种外语都很棒。”

“如果你那么懒惰，干吗不把所有的事情都放下呢？”

“嗯，”他思索了一下说道，“我想那是因为他们都一直在等着我变得更聪明些。如果我能打棒球的话，我也不会打的，你总不能因为玩这些运动弄伤了自己吧。但是我不介意成为一名学者。”

“你瞧，”我说道，“我还不太习惯和一个孩子聊天。”

“哦，那没关系。”他说道。

“我不知道你为什么不能老老实实地坐在那儿读你的书。”

弗恩太太回来了，说道：“在那儿把你的牛奶喝了，”还有，“你的房间已经收拾好了。”她抚摸着孩子的头，男孩说道：“嘿，找一天摩妥尔曼太太要和我一起去看电影哩。”弗恩太太看了我好一会儿，然后说道：“我觉得你会喜欢那个房间的。”

我上楼时带了好几块装在盒子里的点心，我的房间正好四四方方，很不错。我的名字是安吉拉·摩妥尔曼太太，这儿就是我要住的地方了——在史密斯大街弗恩太太楼里一个四方形的房间里。我不知道还要给这个房间添置点儿什么东西，这儿已经有了一张床、一个梳妆台、两把椅子和一张漂亮的小桌子。我最后一次看见类似这张漂亮小桌子的东西，是在我拍卖完家具之后，它已经消失在了一辆旅行车的后备厢里了。柜子抽屉里什么也没有，我还不知道要把什么东西放在里面。还有一个小书柜，我想也就能装十一本书左右，看样子我不得不非常仔细地挑选我的十一本书了。当我选完书后，我会在书的扉页上写上“安吉拉·摩妥尔曼”。我把内衣和袜子放进了梳妆台的抽屉里，把两件长裙和皮毛披肩挂到了壁橱中。以后找点儿时间我要去大百货商店买些新衣服。我把牙刷和梳子放到了梳妆台上，把安眠药片放到了床头柜上，把阅读用的眼镜放到了药片的旁边。我没有宠物，没有通讯录，没有财物放在桌子上，或者钉在墙上；我没有什么朋友要保持联系，也没有什么纪念品。我所拥有的只是我自己。

我喜欢人们，但我绝不需要陪伴，休伊是我唯一的错误。

我坐在房间靠近窗户的一张扶手椅上，我很高兴地看到这里的视线很好，确确实实能向外越过树木看见街上的某个地点，不久前我曾经站在那儿思量过名字的事。“都搞定了，安吉拉，”我非常轻声地对着窗户外面说道，“都搞定了，你成功了，你进到了这里而且一切顺利，无论如何你都来这儿了。”曾经在外面的暗处，某个无名的人给自己起名叫安吉拉·摩妥尔曼太太，然后稳步来到了门口。

我对形状的感觉很敏锐，我喜欢四四方方的东西，而我的房间正好是正方形的，即使我不能在房间里做饭，我想也能生活得很开心。我能接受哪怕是最简陋的房间，我别无所求，只要能有个地儿睡觉，有个地儿坐着，有个地方放东西就行。对我周围环境所有的装饰就是我自己。

这么说的一个理由是，我第一次有这种感觉就是在一个四四方方的房间里。我自己的房间，那时我大约十二岁。而在那之前，大多数的这种感觉都好像耳边轻声低语，记忆非常模糊，好像一个孩子注意某件东西的方式，并不能完全记住，但这次它是真实的，我也不是在做梦，我知道什么时候我会做梦。我半夜在床上坐起来，听见我自己的声音在问道：“什么？什么？”然后我听见了另一个声音，不是来自我自己的大脑——我知道什么会来自我自己的大脑——在说：“找到罗莎琳德·布里克尔。告诉她席德在向她问好。”我听见那个疯狂的声音说了三次，“告诉她席德在向她问好。”

我认识罗莎琳德·布里克尔——这些年来我从未忘记她的名字——因为她在高中时比我大四五岁，第二天我找她还真费了点儿周折，但在她回家的路上我最终找到了她。我记得我费了好大劲才引起了她的注意，我那时不过是个小孩子，而她很受欢迎，漂亮，总爱哈哈大笑。她穿着一件白色的衬衫，一条蓝色的裙子，还戴着一个迷人的手镯。她的头发拳曲着，拿着她的生物课本，还有一个蓝色封皮笔记本。她的鞋是白色的，眼睛是蓝色的，抹着淡淡的口红。我拽着她的袖子说：“罗莎琳德，嗨，罗莎琳德。”声音不是很大，因为她是个高中生了。她转过身低头看着我，皱着眉，因为我还是个孩子，她是个高中生，我拽着她的袖子。“听着，罗莎琳德，”我说，“听着，我应该告诉你席德想向你问好。”“什么？”她说道。“席德说要向你问好。”我说道，说完就跑了，因为我没别的什么可说了，我也觉得很傻。我后来听说，她回到家里就悬梁自尽了。我不知道为什么。

毕竟，这是第一次。从那以后，又有好几次，有几次相比其他几次比较真实。有一次，我对我母亲说：“姥姥要拿起电话跟你通话。”她随口说道：“那好吧。”就在这时电话铃响了。她看着我的样子很好玩，以后这样的事又出现了多次。

“我涉足的领域是超自然。”我告诉弗恩太太。她觉得我在跟她开玩笑。

当我嫁给休伊以后，我就不再涉足超自然领域了，那也是不得已的。

我记得还有一次，当我坐在窗户边的时候，我妈妈——她那个时候对我应该更了解了——对我说：“你为什么总是盯着窗外沉思默想，什么事也不做呢？”

“我正在看那些孔雀走过草坪。”我说道。

“但是你应该出去和其他的孩子一块儿玩，要不你以为我们搬到这个良好的社区是为了什么，所以你干吗总是坐在这里看着窗外而不去跟其他孩子一块儿玩呢？你难道没有朋友吗？没人喜欢你吗？”

“我正在看孔雀呢，”我试图告诉她，“它们正在草坪上溜达，我在观察它们。”

“你应该和你的朋友们出去玩。那些孔雀在我们的草坪上做什么呢，把青草毁掉吗？”她也走上前往窗外看。正如我所说的，她应该早就知道她其实什么也看不到。

有时我能通灵，有时又不能。有很多次我趴在地板上观察小生物在餐厅桌子下的地板上玩耍，我知道我妈妈当然看不见它们，当她过来跟我说为什么要搬到一个好点儿的社区去，还有我为什么不出门去交朋友之类的话的时候，也许她还会踩着它们。有时，我的这个方形房间会挤得满满当当，我只能躺在床上笑着。有时，好几周就这样过去了，我会读某本特别有趣的书，或者画画，或者每天放学后跟在人们的后面，根本什么事也没发生。有时，他们跟着我。有一次，一个老男人跟着我，但是结果证明他是真实的。我能看见猫所看见的东西。

当我大约十六岁的时候，我开始对一切有了自我意识，那倒不是说我开始介意他们老是在各处尾随我。大多数十六岁的女孩喜欢被人尾随，但是随后我知道没有别的人可以看见他们，有时我觉得自己像个傻瓜。你不能一直茫然地盯着空气四处走动，你十六岁时往往会这样，有人会注意到这一点。“你需要眼镜吗？”我妈妈常常这样问我，或者“看在老天的分上，你就不能别再傻呆呆地愣着，闭上你的嘴，梳梳你的头发，出去和别的孩子一起玩玩好吗？”有时一连几周我会想他们已经走了，这也许是好的，我得开始自己梳理我的头发，自己抹指甲油，自己去汽水店，或者去看足球比赛了，我知道接下来的第一件事，是我需要和别人聊天，一张脸可能会隔在我们之间，一张嘴可能会说疯狂的事，我愿意观察和聆听我一直与之聊天的人，愿意等上好一阵子，然后变得紧张不安，当我还听见别的什么声音的时候，就赶紧走开。再过段日子，我跟谁都不说话了。

对于一个女孩子的成长来说，这不是好的方式。如果那时我知道现在所知道的事情，我可能会处理得更好一些，这话说起来倒是容易。如果一个人的脑袋里充满了声音，这些声音没别的人知道，她怎么可能处理得好？我不是在抱怨。

我坐在弗恩太太房子的一个令人愉快的正方形房间里，想着这些事情。自从我能记事起，我就尽可能安静地思索，我一直能看见和听见别人看不见和听不见的东西。现在我能在某种程度上控制这讨厌的事了。当我嫁给休伊以后，它们就完全消失了。我有理由相信现在它们又回来了。我坐在弗恩太太的房子里，在考虑我卖了房子，给自己改名换姓到底有什么好处。当他们凑上来问你话的时候，他们才不管你叫什么名字呢。

刚开始的时候，我想把这些事指给别人。起初我甚至傻到以为别人仅仅是没有注意到。“看那个，”我会说，“看，就在那儿，一个可笑的男人。”对我妈妈来说，她没有花很长时间停下脚步去注意。“根本没有什么可笑的男人，”她会说，并猛地拽一下我的胳膊，“你脑袋里净想什么乱七八糟的东西呢？”还有一次我想告诉一位邻居关于我的见闻，也是很偶然的事，因为我很少告诉任何人。在夏季的某个晚上，他正坐在前门的门廊上。我一直趴在草坪上，仔细观察着草叶间来来去去的萤火虫的亮光，倾听着某种昆虫的歌唱——尤其是在夏季时节，那是我生活的美好世界——他听见我在笑。他让我过去，坐在他的前门门廊上，并递给我一杯柠檬水，然后问我在干什么呢，我走过去告诉了他。我告诉他我所看到的和听到的，他也倾听着，比别的人听到的都多。“你是千里眼，”他跟我说，我会永远记住这句话，他可能对此一无所知，但是他也倾听了，并说我是千里眼。后来，他告诉我妈妈应该带我去某个专科诊所好好检查一下，大约三天以后，她明白我怀孕了。我从未告诉他，其实，曾经一度我还想过告诉他，但是从那以后，他再也没跟我说过话。

我了解很多关于人类的事，很多他们从来不了解的事。但是我从来没有太多的感觉，可能是我从来没有真正地了解我做的一件事是真实的还是虚幻的。

我后来找的这个房子，也几乎是正方形的。它有三层，还有一个地下室，三面是干净整齐的门廊，不管当初是谁修建了这栋房子，要么是太缺乏想象力，要么是脑袋里想的跟我一样，因为每件东西都整齐地摆放在角落里，相同大小的东西会尽量靠在一起。那就是说，一扇门的旁边会是几乎一模一样的另一扇门，只要是有门的地方，门通常都会开在墙的中间位置，在门的两边会留出完全相同的空间。窗户也是同样的设计。

我后来问过弗恩太太，她告诉我这栋房子里的租客共有五人，我想奇数是不对的，但是鉴于我是第五位租户，我就没法再说什么了。不管怎样，她有六个房间可以出租。顶层的租户是个会计，叫布朗德先生；还有一位是卡伯特先生，弗恩太太认为他是做推销的。在第二层，是一名叫弗莱纳太太的老妇人，她经营着一家书店。坎普贝尔先生在运输业工作，还有我。弗恩太太自己住在一楼。“我就想住一层，”她告诉我说，“我过去常常梦想我能住在一层，我盘算了好几年了。我总是想如果把餐厅改成卧室会更好些，我讨厌每天爬楼梯上下楼。一层更加舒服，更加方便，也更加安全。”

“安全？”

“万一着火了，我更容易跑出去。”

我得说在这栋楼房里，我还一直没与那位在运输业工作的坎普贝尔先生会过面。

我很快就发现，我们是一群快活的租客。来这儿时，我只带着一个行李箱、一个皮毛披肩和一个装着很多钱的手袋。而老弗莱纳太太已经在这儿住了九年了，她有一台电视机，家具也是自己的，包括一个中式漆器的桌子、紫色的窗帘和一套银茶具。住在顶层的布朗德和卡伯特每天六点会在彼此的房间里喝上几杯鸡尾酒。弗恩太太往往会在周日时随意地邀上某个客人和她共进晚餐，她跟我差不多都属于擅长做饭弄菜的一类人。布朗德拉大提琴，而弗莱纳太太会一边高声唱歌直到把嗓子唱哑为止。弗莱纳太太还经常玩桥牌，但弗恩太太从未见过还有那样肮脏的作弊手法。布朗德留着一撇小胡子，卡伯特收藏科尔波特瓷器，弗恩太太不喜欢大蒜，结果直到她死那天也做不好美味的色拉汁。布朗德每天晚上铁定会被楼梯的最下面一级的台阶绊倒，他每天凌晨五点半回到家里。他既不是喝醉了，也不是笨手笨脚。据大家所知，他在别处从来没摔倒过，他也从不掉东西和洒东西，但是在每天凌晨五点三十分的时候，布朗德先生就会被楼梯的最下面一级的台阶绊倒。弗恩太太常说，如果把五点三十分设定为闹铃时间对你来说很重要，你可以把布朗德被楼梯的最下面一级的台阶绊倒当作你的闹钟。布朗德、卡伯特、弗莱纳和我通常在街角的一个小饭馆里解决吃饭的问题，但是每个周五晚上，布朗德会去他母亲家里；每个周六晚上，卡伯特会带一个女孩外出，目前为止，他已经和这个女孩交往四年了，弗恩太太说。但是，一想到结婚，他就会觉得太受约束。我喜欢弗恩太太，我几乎没事可干，所以我经常帮她做些家务，歇口气时，我们会坐在厨房喝咖啡和吃些小点心。弗恩太太每隔一天的早上，在每个人起床之前，会烘焙一些小点心，我喜欢住在这栋房子的原因之一就是，在清晨醒来的时候会闻到一股烘焙点心的味道。

我住的房间，正如我所说，绝对是四四方方、方方正正的，我测量过它。我非常喜欢带有方正形房间的楼房，所以当初我放下行囊时，我知道自己会留下来的。我首先拿出了我的照片和我自己的画作。这些画作是与休伊的画作同时完成的，但是是我自己创作的。“如果你喜欢，把它们挂起来吧，”休伊说道，“好吧，你会很自豪的。别以为除了我自己的画，我会讨厌所有的画。”虽然弗恩太太说以后修补墙上的洞会破费的，但我还是把自己的画挂在了墙上。卡伯特和布朗德都喜欢我的画。弗莱纳太太用手指指着画说，它们会吸引她回来的。而弗恩太太说以后修补墙上的洞会破费的。

“您是做哪一行的，摩妥尔曼太太？”布莱德问我。

“有时，干点儿入店行窃的事，”我告诉他，“还管点儿闲事。”

“什么风把你吹到这个城市来了？”

“好奇。”我告诉他。

布莱德和卡伯特邀请我上楼喝鸡尾酒，弗恩太太也邀请我跟她共进周日的晚餐，弗莱纳太太则问我是否会玩桥牌，我说不会。我走到史密斯大街的尽头，拐弯进了那家小公园，坐在了树下。有一天，我去坐有轨电车，电车沿街而行，到了市中心，下车后我进了第一家大商店，想买一件罩衫。

“如果这件罩衫没有四十四码的，”我跟导购小姐说，“我就到街对过的商店看看。”我实际上没穿过大街，我在一家药店停了下来，和店内的一位女士要了一个三明治和一杯奶昔。“现在店里几乎都是药品了。”她对我说，“你甚至不能买到纯香草了，都是药品了。”

“在一家药店，你只能指望买到药品。”

“到处都是这样。你认为你喝的奶昔中真的加了巧克力吗？其实什么都没有，只是些化学品。”

“但我实际上不是来城里买奶昔喝的，我是来买罩衫的。”

“呃，它们都是化学品。衣服、食物、饮料，植物生长不需要别的，只需要水，可实验室现在到处泛滥，这个世界变坏了。”

“波旁威士忌……”

“都是疯狂的太空竞赛。”她撂下一句话，然后走开了。

当我坐上有轨电车回家时，车头上用大写字母写着史密斯大街。“这趟电车是开往史密斯大街的吗？”我问司机，他看了我有一分钟，然后很快地说道：“是的，女士，千真万确。”

“谢谢你，”我说道，“你太太的哮喘病怎么样了？”

“我还没结婚呢，”他说道，“感谢上帝。”

我决定是该举行降神会的时候了，当然，这事我首先得跟弗恩太太说说，因为这是她的房子，我不知道人们开始纷纷来她家求神问卜她会怎么想。“我觉得应该举办一场小型的降神会了。”我对她说。

“都包括哪些内容？”她问我。

“呃，大家围一圈坐着，我坐在中间，我们要喝点儿雪利酒，然后我就能传递信息了。”

“谁提供雪利酒？”

“每个人都有自己希望得到答案的一类问题。这类问题其实可以得到逝去人的回答。”

我敢肯定她马上会说“什么逝去人？”，所以我很快地说道：“如果你不想相信，大可不必当真。”

“谢谢你，”她说道，“我会给你们提供烹饪用的雪利酒的。”

“我能再用一下小客厅吗？”

“那就意味着我得参加，”弗恩太太说道，“除非我选择总是坐在厨房里。”

“您若能参加，我会不胜荣幸。”

“还有什么人参加？”

我早先已经做好了小的标识纸，上面写着“获得的信息”“需要回答的问题”“运势”，然后把它们都钉在我第一天就发现了的书店里。好几个人都表示有兴趣，书店的老板娘承诺会广而告之。于是我告诉弗恩太太，“我觉得会来好几个人，当然了，还有咱们这栋房子里的人。”

“不能包括汤姆，我不允许他来参加降神会。”

“以前出现过什么问题吗？”

“我从没想过会这样。但是他在自己的房间里看书就可以了，他不用进来听。”

“我想用这个小客厅的一个原因就是那把椅子。”

弗恩太太实际上笑了。“那曾是我丈夫最喜欢的椅子，”她说道，“每天晚上他都坐在那儿。”

“他曾经有过什么反应吗，坐在那儿？”

“他从来没想过那有什么值得一提的。但是这把椅子确实不错，不过我自己并不在乎，如果能卖个好价钱，我也会把它卖掉。”

它是把好椅子，椅背都高过我的头顶了，两个扶手也很结实，整体看上去有点儿像王座，不过座位一年四季已经被弗恩太太的屁股宠幸了无数次。每次小客厅的门开着，我都会偷偷溜进去坐上一小会儿，我喜欢那把椅子。

“你确定，”弗恩太太问我，“你不会把原来好好的东西瞎动吧？你确定你知道你正在干什么吗？你确定，摩妥尔曼太太，不会给我捅什么娄子让四邻不安吧？”

“确切地说，有点儿像打长途电话，”我告诉她，“一旦你挂上电话，一切都结束了。”

“我还真不知道一个长途电话对某人来说不意味着麻烦。”

小客厅有一些帷帘，但弗恩太太从不把它们拉上。这也是为什么当我把它们拉上时有很多灰尘飞扬，为什么我忍不住打着喷嚏，弗恩太太对我直皱眉。总的来说，她把家收拾得还是挺干净利落的。我把那把好椅子挪到了房间的中央，在四周摆放了一圈餐厅椅子，没摆太多，因为我不确定会有多少人来，我也不想看上去那么焦虑，只要是没人站着就行。在弗恩太太的房子里，没人会四下站着。或许是因为汤姆总是坐着的缘故，所以她以为人们站着会很不舒服。虽然我有很多钱，但我找了一个橘色的大碗准备放钱，这个碗是弗恩太太经常摆放苹果的，碗放在一个低矮的桌子上，能够注意到桌子挪动得和墙有了一定的距离。“人们可能会扔些零钱。”我告诉弗恩太太。

“我到时会拿来雪利酒和杯子，”她说道，“你可以从伙食费里补给我这部分钱。”

“主要的，那真的是我的一项业余爱好。但是如果它对人们有好处，我为什么要藏而不露呢？”

“如果大多数的人能对大多数的事情藏而不露，这个世界会更加美好。”弗恩太太轻轻地抖动了一下窗帘，“你竟然能发现灰尘来打击我。”她说道。

我不知道书店老板娘在书店的周围怎么给我做的广告，我甚至不知道弗恩太太在小区里都说了些什么，因为当我准备进行降神会时，竟然有八个人到场，加上我，一共有九个人，能来这么多人真的不错了。我决定穿上深蓝色的长袍，现在穿着已经不像以前那么合身了，但谁说一名通灵师一定要穿得光鲜呢？这件衣服的袖子很长，我还戴上了珍珠项链，我会说那是为了休伊，他在我身上从不吝惜钱。

一切妥当，我心想，我将再一次尝试。他们都坐在那里看着我，好像他们害怕我把什么东西罩在他们身上，脸上带着一种警惕的、急切的、敏锐的神情。我意识到自己有点儿拖延。现在我有太多的事情想做，在这么多人的目光注视下，我向后仰着，紧闭双眼。我知道在我灵魂出窍后，他们会一直盯着我，我不喜欢这样。那时我应该马上告诉他们这是个笑话，但是他们是那么信任我。“我对招魂术一无所知，”这个念头在我脑中闪现，“拜托了，你们所有人，都走吧，别再让我做我不喜欢的事情了。”不过我当然不会这么做。我依次看着他们，心想我恨你们，我恨你们，我希望你们彻底失望。我冲弗恩太太点着头，她在大声怒吼，我向后靠着，感觉到椅子上破旧的天鹅绒正摩擦着我的后颈，想知道谁在周围喧哗，进到圈里等着提问，我闭上了眼睛。我能听见他们的呼吸声，放松、缓慢、表示鄙视的呼吸声应该是弗恩太太的，她等着要登场。然后是其他人的，急促而迫切。一位小个女人在看着，男人们也在察觉着、警惕着，很不老实。

我在大厅里，巍峨的大柱子一直伸展到远方。大花坛里有朵朵鲜花，还有——古老的水晶宫殿，也许是吧？——高大闪光的墙壁；还有很多的人。我安静地等待，不知道谁将过来问，等着，等着，然后发现一个男人被挑出，几乎是飘到了我等待的地方，几乎没有动作，当然更没有声音，但人已经过来了。“一名高个男人，”我说道，好像我的声音从遥远的地方传来，“一名高个男人，有所祈求。他的头发灰白，年纪并不是很老，但头发已经灰白。”

“我的父亲。”有人说。

“我的哥哥。”还有人说。

“对不住，应该是我父亲。”

“他说，”我提高了声音，我在里面聆听着，听见他在那边对着他们说话，“他说拿起他留下的那本书，这本书是他临终时拿在手上的，他现在也正拿着这本书。他说拿起这本书，翻到页码……页码……页码……第八页和第五页。”

“爸爸？”

“对不起，是我哥哥，我知道那本书。”

“第八页和第五页。找到那一页，那儿留有信息——一封信？——一条信息。他说留了一条信息。”

“问问他是否幸福。告诉他是他妹妹问的。”

“对不住……”

“他不知道这个词——幸福。他就在这儿，就是这样。他现在要走了。”

“我敢肯定是我父亲，如果我刚才有机会说话……”

“有人在这儿了。”我说道。我能听见自己说话的声音，“这儿有人在找爱丽丝？安娜？安吉拉？”我意识到安吉拉好像有点儿不大对，但是我忘了哪儿不对了，“爱丽丝？”

“我妻子吗？她的名字是艾格尼丝。”

“她病了，是她吗？有人问她是否好些了，病情是否缓解了。有人要你告诉她旧的药方更对症。有人想让她知道她正在得到照料，有人现在正在照顾她，安慰她。”

“但是旧的药没有……”

“告诉她有人正在照顾她，她会好些的。”

“你能让我父亲再回来吗？我必须跟他说句话，真的。”

“这儿有太多太多太多的人了，有的人正想说话，有的人正在离开。一个想说话的人想找女儿，但不是父亲在找女儿。有人在找一个女儿，有做女儿的在这里吗？”

“我母亲吗？我母亲想跟我说话吗？想说些什么呀？”

“你还好吗？你对生活满意吗？有人问你是否安好。”

“那就不是我母亲，因为她……”

“现在已经走了。一些人蜂拥而至，一些人已经渐渐走远。这儿又有了一条信息。不要忘了老金基尔。”

“什么？”

“不要忘了老金基尔。”我的上帝，我心想，从遥远的记忆深处认识到，老金基尔是我曾养过的猫的名字。这是给我的信息，最好赶紧忽略它。“不要忘了老金基尔。”我说道，好像若无其事的样子，“现在又有人问了，在问。给一位妻子的信息。”

“我不想听，”弗恩太太说道。我能听见她的声音底气不足，带着点儿恼怒。“告诉他走吧，我不想听他说的任何话。”

“有人来了，有人想谈谈一个小孩子的事情。是那个小孩子丢了吗？是他又回来了吗？小孩子在哪里？”

“让我父亲回来吧，我们丝毫不知道……”

“现在又来了一条信息，一条给T.L.的信息。”

“是我吗？实际上我名字的首字母是J，但他们总叫我泰迪，我想这信息是给我的。”

“好福气正等着你，T.L.，更大的幸事是有人在告诫你，不要受骗上当。”

这就是我的第一次的降神会。不能说它办得很成功，因为没人给它任何评价，而且碗里只有三十五美分，我不得不从自己腰包里再掏出五十美分付雪利酒的钱。

“他们谈论的一切都是有关死亡和濒死的事情的，”在弗恩太太把客人送走后，我对她说，“他们也都是些穷光蛋。”

“你指望得到些什么？”她打开了窗帘，挥手掸去鼻子前的灰尘。

“他们应该表现出更大的兴趣。”

“如果他们对现实生活感兴趣，他们就不会来听你的降神会了，你会明白的。”

我觉得她正陷入毫无必要的沮丧当中，但是，这也证明了，这正是弗恩太太的独特方式。“他们都疯了，”她说道，“他们想知道的只是有人告诉他们做什么。他们在等着某个怪人给他们指示。”

“某个怪人，你的意思是……”

“我的意思很清楚了，”弗恩太太说道，“鞋是否合适，只有脚知道，摩妥尔曼太太。”





6


好吧，我不想让你们觉得弗恩太太和我都是直来直去的人，总是在吵架。我们属于平时唇枪舌剑，各不相让，可大多数情况下，我们一吵完，就会一起喝着咖啡有说有笑了。可是，我必须说当我开始拿到弗恩太太给我的每周账单时，我还是有些惊讶，因为账单上除了房间的租金外，还有“茶、点心等等”的账目明细。

“我原以为是你请我呢。”第一周时，我对她说道。

“我不想伤害你，”她说道，“我得到的是我应得的。”

在以后的日子里，我开始跟随着人们在城里逛了。有一件事可以肯定：在一个陌生的城市里，如果没人给你带路，你是没有办法找到路的。而弗恩太太，正如你所了解的，即使街上发生了炸弹爆炸，她也绝不会踏出前厅一步。你从陌生人那儿知道路怎么走完全没有问题，我跟着的第一个人是我在一家饭店外偶然碰上的一位老家伙。他一直吃着鱼子酱，我喜欢跟着一个看上去不错，而且满嘴鱼子酱的人，虽然我自己对这不在乎，但是似乎他会把我领向一个比我自己去找要更加有趣的地方。从某种意义上看，也确实如此。“你干吗老跟着我？”他问道，在一个街角他突然转身看着我，我当时还没有像后来那样擅长尾随。

“因为你正在吃鱼子酱。”我说道。有时真相并不伤人。

“我喜欢鱼子酱。”

“我不喜欢。”

“你打算跟我到哪儿？”他仍然有些手足无措，但是我觉得挺好玩。我相信我看上去并不十分可怕。不管怎样，他是个大男人，显然不会有什么内疚，或者至少不会因为被我尾随而困扰。或许被一个年轻可爱的十九岁小伙子跟着他才会多少有些困扰吧。

“来吧，跟我一起喝杯茶。”他说道，掏出一个名片夹，递给了我一张名片。我发誓，我觉得以前从没有人有过这样的举动。“我很乐意，”我告诉他，“这会省下我付给弗恩太太的钱。”

这一天，我试着去商店行窃。因为天气的原因，这种尝试变得尤其重要。在冬日里，有人会突然梦想春天的到来，天空是湛蓝、柔和、清澈的，风也降低了调门，用轻声低语代替了狂野呼啸，太阳也出来了，树木看上去也有些神奇，因为它上面好像蒙着一层淡淡的、浅浅的绿色。这样的天气让我蠢蠢欲动。

“我想尝试在店里偷点儿东西。”我告诉售货员小姐，我们俩都笑了。

我去了最大的百货商店，我以前从来没去过那儿，但是每家大百货商店看上去都差不多。这一家和我以前去过多次的百货商店也没什么两样，我知道货物摆放的位置，辨识出了浓重的香水味道，外面的空气清新，就更显出里面的气味丰富。有时我喜欢大的商店，脚底下踩着软软的地毯，四周商品让人目不暇接。我喜欢长长的柜台，有着柔和的射灯，还有迷人的折叠围巾，未穿衣服的塑料人体模特，甚至是顾客的脏手套。我喜欢大百货商店中的一切，除了不喜欢在里面购物。我不喜欢售货员小姐和她们的态度，不喜欢在某个特殊的大柜台买我的衣服。我还不喜欢那些喜欢让你等待的人眼中愚蠢的讥讽之色。我不喜欢信用社，但是我喜欢因为一张账单而跟人吵架。当我跟一家百货商店的人打架时，休伊常常会不知所措，真的感到害怕，可我根本没感觉到自己在和别人干仗。所以当你跟人干仗时，没有必要注意你不知不觉展现的任何优雅风度。即使是供电公司，我都知道我总跟他们的人干仗，但是我从不和百货商店的人干仗，当然也从不和电话公司的人干仗。我付我们的账单——我并不打算听上去好像我和他们干仗是因为我想省钱——但是我总是很享受为某件事好好打上一架。我喜欢逛百货商店，只是我很吃惊自己长久以来竟然没有想到过要在百货商店里偷点儿东西。“商店偷窃。”我对售货员小姐解释道，还用一只手指轻轻地碰了碰小盒子，我们俩都哈哈大笑起来。

关于怎么去一家百货商店偷东西，我真的不太清楚，但是我想我可以边干边学。那就是说，你可以观察，这是我处理几乎一切事情的方式。我边干边学差不多屡试不爽，甚至经常惊讶于自己的自学能力那么强。我从未想过因为这种方式，我可能会在监狱里度过余生，或者受伤，或者遇到尴尬的事，因为很简单，这类事情从来不会发生在我这样的人身上。我没有凌驾于法律之上，但是我用某种方式制定法律，这是其他那么多人从未做到的。这不是狂妄。当我还是个孩子的时候，我第一次知道了这点，我总能得到我想要的一切。在上帝面前，我想我想要休伊。但是，这不是在商店里偷东西。

有很多原因让我觉得这特别有意思，在此我就不再讨论了，我已经决定我最想做的事情就是去偷一个装饰用的蜡烛。我知道可能会有一家百货商店卖蜡烛、烛台还有精美的火柴盒。我想去偷一个蜡烛，把它送给弗恩太太，摆在令人吃惊的壁炉台的中央。而且，虽然也许不太好藏，但一个蜡烛也不是太值钱。可怜的休伊，他是那么蹩脚的画家。

不管怎样，我走进了一部电梯——脚下的这个小装置，给人一种力量感，一种被抬起来的感觉——而且，可以俯视整个商店。我坐着电梯来到了二层，在女式内衣柜台前逗留了一小会儿，我确实喜欢蕾丝边的内衣。接着又到了百货商店的第三层和第四层，在第四层我发现了一个礼品柜台，就在远处一点儿的地方，我发现了正在苦苦寻觅的蜡烛。也许一支黑色的蜡烛适合弗恩太太下一次的追思弥撒。也许一支可以显示时间的蜡烛——即使我真的觉得有点儿画蛇添足，一支蜡烛最好的部分就是它的不准确性——或者，也许一支顶端是多个花朵的蜡烛，或者一支看上去像洋白菜的蜡烛，或者像房子的蜡烛，或者像一条卷毛狗的蜡烛。我喜欢东西做得看上去像别的什么东西，当然对于食物必须严格除外。我曾经有一个菜谱，教人们把磨碎的菜花做成土豆饼的模样，它们就像听上去的那么恶心。但是在日常生活中，一个简单的伪装对我来说也是可以接受的。

我看见了一支用一千种不同颜色制成的蜡烛，非常可爱。我特别想拥有它。但是要它和偷它是两码事。如果我开始偷它仅仅是因为我想要一支彩色的蜡烛，整个事情就失去了意义，但我已经决定我不买它。所以，我很不情愿地走过这支可爱的蜡烛，找到了另一支丑极了的蜡烛。它看上去很像弗恩太太，我这样想，然后把它装进了口袋里。当我转过身，看见售货员小姐正开心地看着我。当然，她已经看见了我的一举一动，她向前走了一步，说道：“我能帮您吗？”然后等着看我下一步的举动。

很自然地，我把蜡烛从口袋里掏出来并说道：“不，我只是想试着从商店里偷点儿东西。”我们俩都笑了。我把蜡烛又放回了柜台，然后转身走开了，我偷蜡烛的计划就永远泡汤了。那个售货员小姐本来是可以喊人的，也许在她的整个职业生涯中她都一直都在等着有机会能当场抓到一个商店偷窃者；也许今晚在晚餐时，她最值得炫耀的机会，现在就这样毫无希望地毁掉了。毕竟，“我今天亲手抓到了一个在商店偷窃的人”是一个很具有爆炸性效果的故事开头，而“我今天在店里遇见了一个最疯癫的老妇人”则逊色得多。她一定已经接待过数不清的疯癫的老妇人了，对了，要知道，我不是说我真的老了。她讲述这件事时，看起来一定会这样说。所以，我得想法在店里再偷点儿别的什么东西。我不想透露我拿起了多少东西，又不得不放回原处。我似乎真的不太擅长偷窃。不过，我成功地拾起了一盒新生儿告知卡（上面写着“我是个女孩，我是个女孩，我是个女孩”），我想它也适合送给弗恩太太。似乎没人注意到我拿了一盒卡片。但是我刚才硬着头皮放回原处的一件东西是一瓶称为“苗条”的香水，无论从哪方面看它都很漂亮，我真的想要它。

好了，我不是在吹牛，有些事情我办得很漂亮，而有些事情则不灵光。降神会就很成功，但是首先我得承认，我不是个手指灵巧的惯偷。

林中的男人


克里斯多弗疲惫地挪动着他的双腿，因为他也没有别的事情可做，只有沿着这条路继续走下去。他恨这些树木，由于移动缓慢影响了他前进的步伐；他恨脚下的泥土，恨天空，恨这条路、所有的路、各处的路。他从早上开始就一直在走，走了一整天，还有昨天、前天，以及以前所有的那些天，他都在走。回溯无数消逝的行走的日子，他在开始行走之前，走进那个他开启这趟旅程的地方，貌似是多年以前的事情了。今天上午他走过了很多田野，而现在他正走在树林中，道路两旁的树木繁茂，有的倾斜在路的上方，有的弯着巨大而古老的树干与他不期而遇。克里斯多弗早些时候在一个交叉路口进入了森林，拐向通往森林的路之前还有另一条路可选。他曾经回头看了看那条他没有选择的路，这本来是条稳妥的路，通过它可以穿过田野，进出城镇，也许可以到达一个终点，某个克里斯多弗目光所不能企及的地方。

猫儿是在他进入森林不久之后跟他在一起的。它影影绰绰、动作迅速，在树木间时隐时现，起初吓了克里斯多弗一跳，可后来，很奇妙，反而让他感到安慰。猫儿总跟在他身边，克里斯多弗行走时，它紧贴着他，就像树木持续逼近，紧贴着他们俩一样。猫儿在害怕的时候，往往容易接受人类的陪伴，所以，这只猫儿在克里斯多弗旁边一路小跑，很随意。克里斯多弗停下来休息的时候，有一次坐在路旁的一块大石头上，用手挠着猫儿的耳朵，充满爱怜地捋着猫儿的尾巴，嘴里念念有词，“小家伙，我们去哪儿？有什么想法吗？”而猫儿先是意味深长地闭上眼睛，然后又睁开了。

“自从我们进到这片树林，至今也没看到一座房屋。”克里斯多弗后来有一次对着猫儿说道，他抬眼斜视着天空，又补充道，“天就快黑了。”他又担心地瞥了一眼身边的树木，在寂静中他被自己的声音弄得心烦意乱，好像树木们正在听他的自言自语，而且边听边肃穆地彼此点头。

“别担心，”克里斯多弗冲着猫儿说道，“这条路一定是通向某个地方的。”




天还不是太晚——也许离天黑还有一个小时——克里斯多弗和猫儿在路拐弯的地方停了下来。因为他们吃惊地发现，一座房屋赫然立在前方。整整齐齐的石头围墙一直延伸到了路上，炊烟很自然地从烟囱里冒出来。门和窗户没有被钉子钉死封上，台阶也没有破损，门上铰链也没有下垂。房屋看上去很温馨，一座敦敦实实的老房子，就像路边的石头围墙一样，也是用石头建成的，即使在没有小路的森林中也很容易被发现。因为它不偏不倚，紧凑地位于路的尽头，当然那也根本称不上路，仅仅是一条通向房屋的小径。克里斯多弗脑海里闪过了很久以前，他没选择的那另一条路。他走向了那座房屋的前门，而猫儿就在他的脚旁。

一条河流的水流声从树林中传来。河流显然知道流出森林的途径，因为它清澈而甘甜，可以看到水底清晰可见的石头，河水毫不畏惧地流过，在黑暗的森林中一往无前。

克里斯多弗走近了屋子，如同他在旅途中走近过的所有房屋——农庄、郊区的房子，或者城市的公寓楼——一样，他怀着一种喜悦的心情在透着温暖的门前礼貌地敲门。

“请进。”一个女人打开了门并招呼道。克里斯多弗迈进了屋子，猫儿紧跟在后面。

女人往后退了退，盯着克里斯多弗看了一会儿，她的眼睛很大，目光充满探寻的意味。他也看着她，能看出她挺年轻，但不是他喜欢的那种真正的年轻，对于生活在森林深处的女人来说，这个岁数显得太年轻了。

“我在这儿已经有很长时间了。”她说道，好像读出了他心头的疑问。当她走出黑暗的过道，他心想，她看起来又可能有点儿老。她的头发有一点儿拳曲，耷拉在脸上。相对于五官的其他部分，她的眼睛有点儿太大了，好像是她老得去看森林的幽暗造成的。她穿着一件绿色长裙，在腰间系了一条带子，后来他看出来带子是用草编的绳子做成的。她光着脚。当他不安地站在屋里时，两个人面面相觑，猫儿在厅里转圈跑着，有时好奇地在角落中或者在紧闭的门前停下来。他抬眼看了看，发现门厅远远的一端有一个梯子，通向没有一丝光线的高处。

“它在闻另外一只猫的味道，”她说道，“我们也养了一只。”

“菲丽丝，”一个声音从屋子后面传来，另外一名女子紧张地看着克里斯多弗，然后很快又对他微笑着说，“请进来，我真不应该让您久等。”

他跟着她来到大厅后面的一个门前，门紧挨着那个楼梯，谢天谢地，她打开门时，屋里透出的光线好像在迎接他们。这个房间直接通向一个特别温暖的厨房，炉膛中的火苗烧得正旺。而桌子上和架子上的三盏煤油灯，更是一扫迟暮森林的黑暗，把屋里照得很亮。第二个女人站在炉子边，观察着正炖着东西的大锅，洋葱和香草的味道让人发狂。克里斯多弗闭上了双眼，就像猫儿一样，享受着令人难以置信的温暖、光亮，以及洋葱的味道。

“嗯，”炉边的女人扭过头看着克里斯多弗，最后说。她仔细地研究着他，就像第一个女人那样，然后又把目光落在了厨房墙壁上方，一处石灰水涂过的区域，那儿横竖交叉的线条表明这是一个简陋的计数系统，她下结论似的说道：“又过了一天。”

“你叫什么名字？”第一个女人向克里斯多弗问道。他随口回答道：“克里斯多弗，”然后又反问她，“你呢？”

“菲丽丝，”年轻的女人说道，“你的猫叫什么名字？”

“我不知道。”克里斯多弗说道。他笑了笑，“它不是我的猫。”他又继续说道，声音仿佛从洋葱的气味中汲取了力量，“它只是跟我到这儿的。”

“那我们给它取个名字吧。”菲丽丝说道。当她开口时，她会看着别处，而不看克里斯多弗，只有在她不说话时，才会用大眼睛再次看他。“我家的猫叫格瑞麦尔金。”(1)

“格瑞麦尔金。”克里斯多弗说道。

“它的名字，”菲丽丝说道，然后用她的头指向厨师道，“她的名字是西茜(2)婶婶。”

“是瑟茜(3)。”岁数大一些的女人固执地说，可脸还冲着炉子。“我出生时就叫瑟茜，直到我死我还叫瑟茜。”

从她站的姿势，以及一字一顿的说话方式上来看，她的岁数似乎要比菲丽丝大得多。克里斯多弗借着灯光看清了她的脸，她精力充沛、目光清澈，而且手臂很有劲儿。当她把大铁锅轻松地从炉子上端下来，然后又把它放到厨房中央的石桌上时，克里斯多弗很是吃惊。猫儿跟着克里斯多弗和菲丽丝进了厨房，悄无声息地跳到了桌子边的长凳上，然后又跳到了桌子上。菲丽丝谨慎地看了克里斯多弗一会儿，轻轻地推了推猫儿，把它赶下了桌。

“我们得给你的猫起个名字。”当猫儿毫无抗拒地跳下地的时候，她抱歉地说道。

“就叫凯蒂(4)吧，”克里斯多弗无助地说道，“我总是把猫随口叫作凯蒂。”

菲丽丝摇了摇头，正要开口说话，西茜婶婶用目光阻止了她。菲丽丝快步走到厨房角落的一个铁柜子旁，从里面拿出了一块布，铺在了桌子上，还把沉重的石盘子和石杯子放在了桌子的四个边上。克里斯多弗坐在长凳上，背冲着桌子，是为了清楚地表明他没有理所当然地上桌吃饭的打算，坐在长凳上只是因为他累了，他不会转过身面向桌子，除非受到主人热情的邀请和明确的表示。

“我们差不多都准备好了吧？”西茜婶婶说道，她扫视了一下桌子，调整了一只叉子的位置，又退回来站着。她的目光没有落在克里斯多弗身上片刻。然后，她又走到了大门旁的墙边，就在那儿安静和笔直地站着，而菲丽丝也走过去站在了她身边。克里斯多弗转过头去看着她们，接着，他又不得不转了回来，因为他听见有脚步声从门厅处传了过来。过了一会儿，但他觉得是很漫长的等待，门开了。两个女人恭恭敬敬地站在远处的墙边，不知道为什么，克里斯多弗也站了起来，可能是因为男主人要进来了。

这是个即将步入老年的男人，虽然他向后僵硬地端着肩，但它们依然看上去好像不这样努力端着，就要垂下去一样。他的脸满是皱纹和倦容，而他的嘴，如同他的肩，好像马上要塌陷下去一样。他的穿着跟那两个女人一样，是一件绿色的长袍，在腰间用带子系了一下，他也一样光着双脚。当他站在门口时，身后是门厅里的黑暗。他的白发发出柔和的光，明亮的眼睛好奇地打量了克里斯多弗很长时间。然后，就像那个年纪大一些的妇女一样，他把目光落到了墙上部的那个简陋的计数系统上。

“您的光临让寒舍蓬荜生辉。”他最后对克里斯多弗说道，声音洪亮，如同林中的风声。他没有再说话，坐到了石桌顶头的座位，然后示意克里斯多弗坐在他的右手边。菲丽丝从门边站立的位置走过来，悄悄地坐到了克里斯多弗的对面，而西茜婶婶先是把铁锅里吃的东西都给他们端了上来，然后才坐到了石桌尾部的座位上。

克里斯多弗盯着面前的盘子，洋葱和炖肉浓烈的香味扑面而来，他在开始吃之前又闭上眼睛使劲闻了闻。当他抬起头睁开眼睛时，越过菲丽丝的头，看见了一扇漆黑的窗户，树木紧紧贴着它，树枝弯曲，压着玻璃，纠缠在一起的树叶和树枝好像在往里面窥视。

“我们怎么称呼你？”上了岁数的男人终于又开口问克里斯多弗。

“我叫克里斯多弗。”克里斯多弗回答道，眼睛要么看着盘子，要么看着窗户。

“你是从远方来的吗？”老人又问道。

“很远，”克里斯多弗微笑着，“我的意思是说，它似乎比实际的更远。”他解释道。

“我叫奥克斯。”老人说道。

克里斯多弗努力地定了定神。自从进了这座奇怪的房屋，他就有些不知所措，好像喝醉了酒，刚刚穿过无边无际的树林，又好像心神不安地从黑暗和迷幻的森林中来到了这座屋子，没有经过寒暄和介绍就坐到了主人的桌子旁。他一边狼吞虎咽地吃着，一边扭过头看着奥克斯先生说道：“您真是太好了，请我进屋。如果不是这样的话，我想我一定会在树林中摸索一整晚上的。”

奥克斯先生微微向克里斯多弗点头致意。

“我觉得我有点儿吓坏了，”克里斯多弗说道，伴随着些许尴尬的笑声，“到处都是树。”

“的确是这样，”奥克斯先生平静地说道，“到处都是树。”

克里斯多弗心里在盘算着，他是否已经充分地表达出了他的感激之情。他很想进一步说些什么，这兴许可以让他清楚地知道他是否还能得到更多的帮助：比如说，他是否可以在这儿住一个晚上。否则的话，他就不得不再次回到黑暗的树林当中去了。如果他晚上可以住在这儿，第二天早上是否还能得到和这顿晚餐一样的款待。当西茜婶婶又一次往他的盘子里盛满食物时，克里斯多弗抬头微笑着，“饭菜太可口了，”他对她说道，“我从没像今天这样，一顿吃这么多。”

西茜婶婶向他点了点头，就像奥克斯先生那样。

“当然，这些食物都来自树林，”奥克斯先生说道，“西茜在河边挖洋葱，但是，这些事自然不劳你费神。”

“我想我是不用操心，”克里斯多弗说道，觉得自己今天晚上不能待在这儿了。

“明天很快就到了，但你有足够的时间参观一下这座屋子。”奥克斯先生补充道。

“我想我会好好看看的。”克里斯多弗说道，意识到他晚上确实可以留宿了。

“今晚，”奥克斯先生说道，他故意显得声音轻快，“今晚，我想听听你的故事，你旅途中的见闻，还有你离开的世界发生了什么。”

克里斯多弗微笑着，心里明白他能在晚上留下来了，在明天早上之前，由于主人的好意，他不会被打发走，他立马觉得很放松。西茜婶婶准备的丰盛晚饭也让他很是满意，他做好了充分准备，打算和主人好好聊聊天。

“我真的不知道我怎么到的这儿的，”他说道，“我仅仅是选了条进林子的路。”

“你是得穿过树林才能到这儿。”主人严肃地赞同这种说法。

“在此之前，”克里斯多弗继续说道，“我路过了很多农舍，还有一个小城镇——您知道它的名字吗？我向那儿的一位妇女求一顿饭吃，结果她把我打发走了。”

在吃完西茜婶婶丰盛的晚饭之后，再回忆起这件事，他现在哈哈大笑了起来。

“再之前，”他说道，“我在学校学习。”

“你是个读书人，”老人说道，“看得出来。”

“我不知道为什么，”克里斯多弗最后扭头看着奥克斯先生，坦诚地说道，“我不知道为什么，”他重复道，“有一天我在那儿，在大学里，就像其他人一样。可接下来，第二天我就离开了，没有任何原因，我就那么做了。”他把目光从奥克斯先生身上转向了菲丽丝和西茜婶婶身上，她们都在茫然地看着他，期待他说清楚。他停了下来，然后，有头没尾地说道：“我想这就是我来这儿之前发生的所有事情。”

“他还带来了一只猫。”菲丽丝轻声说道，眼睛看着地面。

“一只猫？”奥克斯先生礼节性地用眼睛环顾了厨房，看见克里斯多弗的猫正蜷缩在炉子下面，然后点点头，“有人还带过一条狗，”他对西茜婶婶说道，“你还记得那条狗吗？”

西茜婶婶不动声色地点了点头。

这时，从门那儿传来了一阵声音，菲丽丝看也没看就说道：“那是我们的格瑞麦尔金回来吃晚饭了。”

西茜婶婶站起身，走到外边的门前，把门打开了。一只猫很悠闲地一溜小跑进了厨房。这只猫长着虎皮一样的条纹，不像克里斯多弗的猫是黑色的，但是两只猫的个头差不多大。这只猫一眼也没看西茜婶婶，径直来到了炉子旁，然后看到了克里斯多弗的猫。克里斯多弗的猫懒洋洋地抬起了头，睁开了眼睛，盯着格瑞麦尔金。

“我觉得它们快要打架了，”克里斯多弗紧张地说，他还没完全从座位上站起来，“也许，我最好……”

然而，他还是迟了一步。格瑞麦尔金发出一声声嘶力竭的嚎叫，而克里斯多弗的猫则吐着口水，在炉子下舒服的“猫床”上一动不动。格瑞麦尔金鲁莽地走上前，被克里斯多弗的猫抓了个措手不及，呜呜声和尖叫声不绝于耳，它们短兵相接。接着，格瑞麦尔金哀号着跑出了西茜婶婶刚才为它打开的门。

奥克斯先生叹了口气，“你的猫叫什么名字？”他问道。

“我太抱歉了，”克里斯多弗说道，心中涌起一丝担心，这只失去理性的猫可能会把他们俩能有张床过夜的机会弄没了，“我能去外面把格瑞麦尔金找回来吗？”

奥克斯先生笑了起来，“它是在公平的较量中落败的，”他说道，“没有资格回来了。”

“现在，”菲丽丝柔声说道，“现在我们可以把你的猫叫作格瑞麦尔金了。现在我们有这个名字，格瑞麦尔金，既然我们没有猫了，我们就能用这个名字叫你的猫了。”




当天晚上，克里斯多弗睡在屋子顶层的一间石屋中，通过一段黑暗的楼梯可以到达这里，楼梯也通向门厅。奥克斯先生来到房间给了他一支蜡烛，而克里斯多弗的猫儿——现在叫作格瑞麦尔金了——离开温暖的炉子跟着克里斯多弗也来到了房间。房间不大，但很整洁。克里斯多弗在主人走了之后，开始仔细地观察这个房间。床是用一条石凳做成的，更让他吃惊的是床垫里塞满了树叶，而毯子是沉沉的皮毛，看上去像熊的皮毛。

“这真是一座森林，”克里斯多弗一边跟猫儿说着，一边用双手摩挲着熊皮的一角，“还有不寻常的一家。”

克里斯多弗房间的窗户，跟屋子里所有的窗户一样，都正对着树木围成的墙，树木正奋不顾身地把自己压向玻璃。“我奇怪为什么他们只用石头修建这座房屋？”克里斯多弗向猫儿发问，“是因为只有这样这些树木才不会把房子挤压垮吗？”

整个晚上，树木的声音一直充斥着克里斯多弗的梦境，在梦里唯一能感到安慰的是，猫儿也盖着厚厚的皮毛被，在他的旁边呼呼大睡。




清晨，克里斯多弗下楼来到厨房，菲丽丝和西茜婶婶穿着绿色长袍，正在炉子边来来往往。他的猫儿一直跟着他，下了楼梯后，马上跑到了他的前面进了厨房，坐到了炉子底下，眼巴巴地望着西茜婶婶。当菲丽丝收拾好石桌后，西茜婶婶把食物都放到了上面。她们俩走到了门口，像昨晚做的那样，等待着奥克斯先生进来。

他进来后，向克里斯多弗点了点头，像昨晚一样，他们坐到了自己的座位上。西茜婶婶给他们所有人的盘子里都盛上了早餐。奥克斯先生今天早上没有说话，吃完饭后，他站起身，示意克里斯多弗跟着他。他们走了出来，进了门厅，寂静的四周有好几扇紧闭的门，奥克斯先生停顿了一下。

“当然，你只看见了这座房屋的一部分，”他说道，“女仆们只能待在厨房里，除非召唤她们，她们才可以到门厅来。”

“她们在哪儿睡觉？”克里斯多弗问道，“在厨房里吗？”话刚出口，他马上对自己的问题感到窘迫，尴尬地对奥克斯先生笑笑说，不必回答这么傻的问题，但是奥克斯先生觉得很好玩似的摇了摇头，把手放到了克里斯多弗的肩上。

“在厨房的地板上。”他说道。但当他扭过头去的时候，克里斯多弗能看见他正在笑。“瑟茜，”他说，“睡在更靠近门厅的那扇门后面。”

克里斯多弗觉得自己的脸变红了，幸亏门厅里比较黑，他很快地又说道：“房子很古老了，对吗？”

“非常古老，”奥克斯先生回答道，好像对这个问题很吃惊，“当然，房子是至关重要的东西。”

“当然。”克里斯多弗非常认可这种说法，说道。

“这儿，”奥克斯先生边说，边打开了入口处两扇大门中的一扇，“这儿保存着很多典籍。”

克里斯多弗跟着他走了进去，奥克斯先生走近一个石桌，桌上放着一支用自己流下的蜡粘住的蜡烛，他用蜡烛旁边的打火石点燃了它，然后把蜡烛高高举起。克里斯多弗看到四面墙都被石头覆盖着，这些石头摞起来，搭成了松散、不规则的架子。一些架子上立着很大的、羊皮封面的书籍，另一些架子上放着些石碑，还有一卷卷的羊皮文稿。

“它们都价值连城，”奥克斯先生难过地说道，“当然，我不知道怎么利用它们。”他在架子前慢慢地走过，摸着一本很大的书卷，然后转过身，给克里斯多弗看他沾满灰尘的双手。“这是我心里的痛，”他说道，“我无法利用这些有着巨大价值的东西。”

面对卷帙浩繁的典籍，克里斯多弗大吃了一惊，退到了门口。“曾经有一段时光，”奥克斯先生摇着头说道，“这儿的藏书比现在还要多，还要多得多。我听说曾经有一度，这间屋子被建得足够大来装这些典籍，我不知道后来它们怎么被毁掉了。”

他手上还拿着蜡烛，他领着克里斯多弗出了房间，把身后的大门关上了。穿过门厅，他们来到了另一扇门前。当奥克斯先生举着蜡烛带路时，克里斯多弗看出这是另一间卧室，比他睡觉的那间要大得多。

“这间，当然，”奥克斯先生说道，“是我一直睡觉的地方，我要护卫典籍。”

他把蜡烛再次举高，克里斯多弗看见了一张石床，和他昨晚睡的那张石床一模一样，上面铺着厚厚的皮毛，在床头上方墙面的石缝之间，镶嵌着两个木桩，木桩上横放着一把闪闪发光的长刀。

“典籍的看护者。”奥克斯先生叹了口短气说道。然后在烛光里对着克里斯多弗笑了笑。“我们两个就像朋友，”他补充道，“一个人让另一个人参观他的房屋。”

“但是……”克里斯多弗刚想张嘴说话，奥克斯先生便笑了。

“让我领你看看我的玫瑰。”他说道。

克里斯多弗无奈地跟着他回到了门厅，奥克斯先生吹灭了蜡烛，把它放到了门旁的架子上，然后走出前门，来到房前一小块被开垦出来的土地上。土地四周是一些石头围墙，一直延伸到那条进来的路上。虽然这儿和森林只相距一小段距离，但这个世界好像摆脱了树木的困扰，但这里也不是光线很足或者赏心悦目；因为森林仅仅勉强被石头围墙阻挡了一下，森林的边缘离这里非常近，树木迎面压过来，就像克里斯多弗昨天所感受到的那样，用一种可怕的控制，把小石屋密不透风地包围起来。

“这儿就是我的玫瑰。”奥克斯先生说道，声音中带着一丝温暖。他说话的时候，目测着这里与森林之间的距离，目测着树木和他的玫瑰之间的距离。“是我自己种的，”他说道，“我是第一个在大片的森林中开垦出这一小块土地的人。因为我想在荒野的中间种植玫瑰。即使这样，”他又说，“我不得不派西茜去从野兽出没的森林中寻找玫瑰，把它们种在这儿，种在我亲手开垦的这一小块土地上。”他充满深情地俯身看着玫瑰，玫瑰迎着石屋盛开着，玫瑰在藤蔓上耀武扬威般地几乎长到了门的顶部。然而，越过他，越过玫瑰，越过屋顶，树木急切地斜倚过来。

“每年春天都需要把玫瑰绑在木桩上。”奥克斯先生说道。他后退了一步，用手比画着头顶的高度，“一个木桩——把一棵小树削掉枝叶就行，西茜会去找合适的树，削成木桩——把玫瑰的藤蔓绑在木桩上，而木桩要斜靠在屋子上。”

克里斯多弗点了点头，“我能想象，总有那么一天，玫瑰会覆盖整个屋子。”他说道。

“你这么认为吗？”奥克斯先生转身热切地看着他，“我的玫瑰？”

“看上去会这样。”克里斯多弗尴尬地说。他的手指摸着第一根木桩，它正倚在房子的石墙上。

奥克斯先生摇着头，微微一笑，“别忘了是谁种的它们。”他说道。




他们又进了屋，穿过门厅进了厨房。他们进去的时候，西茜婶婶和菲丽丝正靠墙站着。他们再一次坐到了石桌旁，西茜婶婶给他们盛好了食物。奥克斯先生在饭桌上又没吭声，而菲丽丝和西茜婶婶只低着头吃着盘中的食物。

饭后，奥克斯先生在离开房间之前，向克里斯多弗倾了倾身子。菲丽丝和西茜婶婶清理着桌上的盘子和桌布，克里斯多弗坐在凳子上，猫儿趴在他的膝盖上。女人们似乎异乎寻常地忙碌，西茜婶婶在炉子旁放上了好几个铁锅，都够做十二顿饭的了，而菲丽丝被派去从厨房角落的壁龛里取一个特殊的器皿，但过了一会儿她空手回来了，说道：“上次用过以后，它不知被放到哪儿去了，没找到。”西茜婶婶不得不放下她的炊勺，亲自去找了。

菲丽丝在桌子上放了一个很大的馅饼皮，她和西茜婶婶正在用勺子慢慢而又充满爱意地往里填馅。馅是放在炉子上的瓦罐里的，她们一会儿从这个里边舀一点儿，一会儿又从另一个里边舀一点儿。有时停下来尝尝，感觉着咸淡，用眼神彼此交换着意见。

“你们在做什么？”克里斯多弗忍不住问道。

“一场宴席。”菲丽丝说道，飞快地瞟了他一眼，然后走了。

克里斯多弗的猫儿看着，发出了满足的呼哧声，直到西茜婶婶也不见了，又去厨房的壁龛里找东西去了。她回来时，拿着一块在克里斯多弗看来像是野猪肉的东西。她和菲丽丝把这块肉放到烤肉叉上用炉火炙烤，菲丽丝坐在炉子旁转动着烤肉叉。这时，克里斯多弗的猫儿跳到了地上，跑向了壁炉，坐在菲丽丝的身边。当烤肉叉转动时，肥油滴在了巨大的炉膛上，猫儿垂涎欲滴。

“谁来参加宴席？”克里斯多弗逗乐子似的问道。

菲丽丝朝他周围看了看，西茜婶婶从炉子那儿转过半个身子。厨房中出现了一阵沉默，每个人都纹丝不动，几乎听不到呼吸声。在有人开口说话前，门打开了，奥克斯先生进来了。他从卧室里拿出了那把长刀，他把刀递给克里斯多弗看，还无可奈何地耸了耸肩。当奥克斯在桌前坐下后，西茜婶婶又消失了，从壁龛里拿回来一块磨刀石，把它放到了奥克斯先生的面前。奥克斯先生故意用一种小心翼翼的讨人喜欢的动作，开始磨刀了。他把明亮的刀刃挨着磨刀石一下一下地磨着，让刀刃一点儿一点儿地变得无比锋利。

“你说你是从远处来的？”他在磨刀声中突然问道，有好一阵子，他的眼睛离开了磨刀石落到了克里斯多弗的身上。

“很远的路，”克里斯多弗盯着磨刀石说道，“准确地说，我不知道有多远。”

“你是一个读书人吗？”

“是的，”克里斯多弗说道，“我是个学生。”

奥克斯先生的目光从刀上再次抬了起来，在估算着墙上的标记。

“克里斯多弗，”他轻声叫道，好像在估量这名字的分量。

刀已经磨得很锋利了，他把它举到了火光处，仔细观察着刀锋。然后，他看着克里斯多弗，幽默地摇摇头，“像任何武器一样锋利。”他说。

西茜婶婶第一次主动开口说话，“太阳落山了。”她说。

奥克斯先生点点头，他看了菲丽丝一会儿，又看看西茜婶婶。然后，他手里拿着锋利的刀，走了过去，用另一只空着的手搂着克里斯多弗的肩膀。“你还记得那些玫瑰吗？”他问道，“如果它们真的打算成长，就必须在春天给它们绑上。”

有好一会儿，他的胳膊亲切地搂着克里斯多弗的肩膀。然后，他拿着刀，走到后门边等在那儿。西茜婶婶过来为他打开了门。当门打开的时候，树木立马映入了他们的眼帘，它们黑暗而贪婪。西茜婶婶在奥克斯先生走出去之后关上了门，她后背靠着门站了有一分钟的时间，看着克里斯多弗，随后闪到一边，又把门打开了。克里斯多弗瞪大了眼睛，慢慢地向开着的门走去，就像西茜婶婶似乎希望他那样做一样，听见菲丽丝从他身后炉膛那儿传过来的声音。

“他会沿着河边走的，”她轻声说道，“绕着圈走远一点儿，跟在他的后面。”

门在克里斯多弗身后紧紧地关上了，他倚在门上，惊恐地看着树木从四面八方向他扑来。当他恐惧万分地把后背贴在门上的时候，他听见了一个从河那边传来的声音，非常清晰，穿过树木盘旋而至，他几乎听不出那是奥克斯先生的声音：“谁敢闯进我的林子？”

疑神疑鬼


哈洛伦·贝雷斯福德先生这一整天在办公室里过得很充实，他虽然觉得有些疲乏，但心情还不错。在八小时之后，他的脸仍然像刚刮过胡须般精神干净，熨烫过的裤子也没有什么褶皱，心中惦记着的事尤其让他愉悦。他走出了糖果店，腋下夹着一大盒糖果，步伐轻快地走向街角。在纽约的每一条街区上，都有二十个如同贝雷斯福德先生一样穿着小号灰色西服的人；有五十个在装有空调的办公室里工作了一天，仍然面庞干净、裤线笔挺的人；也许还有一百个个头不高，因为惦记妻子生日而心情愉悦的人。贝雷斯福德先生打算带他妻子出门吃晚饭，还决定去碰碰运气，看他是否能在最后一刻买到演出的门票，当然还有要带给她的糖果。天气相当好，贝雷斯福德先生沿街快速地走着，自己一边走还一边哼着小曲。

他在街角停了下来，考虑为了节省时间，是否应该坐公交车，或者在拥挤的车流中试着打一辆出租车。到市区还有很长一段路，要是在平时，贝雷斯福德先生喜欢静静地在一辆第五大道的公交车上坐着，有时还会看会儿报纸。他不喜欢熙熙攘攘的地铁，而在大庭广众之下，挥舞着手臂，大喊着叫一辆出租车，他又做不到。但是，今天晚上在糖果店里，为了给他妻子买最爱吃的巧克力糖果，他已经花了很长时间去排队，要想在晚饭前把它摆上桌，他真得抓紧点儿时间。

贝雷斯福德先生紧跑了几步，在街边挥着手，用一种无助的像是假嗓子的声音喊道：“出租车！”可出租车好像没听见似的开走了，他只得很尴尬地退回到人行道上。在人行道上，一个戴着帽子的男人在贝雷斯福德先生身边站住，有那么一会儿，在拥挤的人流中，他盯着贝雷斯福德先生看，而贝雷斯福德先生也盯着他看，就好像有时人们会下意识地回头看一样。贝雷斯福德先生看到在轻便帽子的下面，这个男人的脸很瘦，长着小胡子，外套的领子向上竖着。是个看上去很滑稽的家伙，贝雷斯福德先生这样想道，他轻轻地摸了一下胡子刮得很干净的嘴唇。也许那个男人认为贝雷斯福德先生几乎是无意识的动作冒犯了他，至少在他转身走开之前，他皱着眉头，上上下下打量了贝雷斯福德先生一番。贝雷斯福德先生心里暗骂：讨厌的丑家伙。

贝雷斯福德先生平常坐的第五大道的公交车渐渐地驶到街角，贝雷斯福德先生很高兴不用费事再去打出租车了，于是跑向了公交车站。他伸出手去抓车门里的扶手，可被人用胳膊肘粗暴地挤到了一边，那个戴轻便帽子的丑家伙抢在他前面挤了上去。贝雷斯福德先生咕哝地抱怨着，跟在他后面开始往上挤，但是车上挤满了人，车门突然关上了。贝雷斯福德先生眼睁睁地看着公交车沿着大街开走了，他看到的最后一幕就是那个戴着轻便帽子的男人在车门里面，冲着他挤眉弄眼地咧嘴笑着。

“卑鄙的伎俩。”贝雷斯福德先生自言自语道，怒气冲冲地抖了抖肩膀。在懊恼之下，他又跑了几步到了街上，再次挥手想打一辆出租车，而且用一个不像是自己的声音喊着，可他差一点儿就被一辆运货的卡车撞倒了。当贝雷斯福德先生跳回人行道的时候，卡车司机伸出头来，冲贝雷斯福德先生不知喊叫着什么。贝雷斯福德先生看见街角周围的人都在笑他，他决定朝市区方向一路走过去。再走过两个街区，那里有另一个公交车站，那儿也比较容易打车，而且还有一个地铁站。尽管贝雷斯福德先生极其不喜欢地铁，但有时他仍然不得不坐它回家。他往市区方向走着，他的腋下夹着糖果盒，身上灰色的西装几乎没有受到街角拥挤人群的影响，贝雷斯福德先生决定不去想刚才那些郁闷的事，而要多想想今天是他妻子的生日。他走着走着又开始哼起了小曲。




他一边走路，一边观察着身边的人们。作为一个男人，他刚才成功地摆脱掉了负面情绪的影响，眼力变得敏锐起来。很显然，迎面向他走来的那个穿高跟鞋的女孩，眉头紧锁，不能让自己从鸡毛蒜皮的小烦恼中解脱，或者她皱眉的原因仅仅是鞋不合适。一位老太太和一个男人正在看着商店的橱窗争吵。那个长相滑稽、戴轻便帽的家伙从人群中快步走来，看起来他好像对某人心怀仇恨……对，就是那个长相滑稽、戴轻便帽的家伙。贝雷斯福德先生绕过前面走着的人群，回头看到那个戴轻便帽的男人突然转身，开始往市区方向走来，就在贝雷斯福德先生身后大约十英尺的地方。这是怎么回事？贝雷斯福德先生吃惊地问着自己，同时加快了步伐。兴许他是因为某种原因从公交车上下来了吧，可能是坐错车了。那么他为什么刚才往市郊方向走，而不是换乘另外一辆公交车呢？贝雷斯福德先生耸耸肩，经过了两个女孩，她们俩并肩从他身边走过，边走边说着话。

走到距离他想去的街角还有一半路的时候，贝雷斯福德先生既吃惊又厌恶地发现，那个戴轻便帽的男人就在他的身边，不紧不慢地跟他并排走着。贝雷斯福德先生向一侧扭过头去，故意放慢了脚步。这个男人也慢了下来，一眼也没看贝雷斯福德先生。

简直是胡闹，贝雷斯福德先生心想，也懒得琢磨除此之外还有什么缘由会这样。他把糖果盒稳稳地夹在胳膊下，猛然逆着去往市郊的人群走进了一家商店。这是一家卖纪念品和小摆设的商店，他穿过店门时，意识到了这一点，店里只有两三个人——一位妇女、一个小女孩和一个水手——贝雷斯福德先生远远地躲到柜台的一端，开始反复摆弄一个精致的香烟盒，盒子上面写着“纽约城纪念品”，下面印着三角尖塔和圆球的图案。

“这个难道不是挺好玩的吗？”母亲对着小女孩说道，她们两个人都开始对着一个像便池一样的火柴盒哈哈大笑起来，火柴放在一个碗状物中。贝雷斯福德先生能够看到，那个盖子上也有三角尖塔和圆球的图案，图案上方写着“纽约城纪念品”。

戴轻便帽的男人也走进了这家商店，贝雷斯福德先生背过身去，好像忙着从柜台里一件接着一件地挑选商品。他的一半心思放在挑一个没有印着“纽约城纪念品”的小礼物上，另一半心思在对那个戴轻便帽的男人的疑惑上。但是，那个戴轻便帽的男人究竟想干什么的问题马上让位给了他的目标是谁这个问题。如果他戴着轻便帽子等掩饰身份的盘算是针对贝雷斯福德先生的，那么这一定是不怀好意的，而且在此之前，他为什么不把他的意图明说出来？贝雷斯福德先生的脑海中还快速闪现过他要跟这个男人搭讪，问他的目的何在的画面，在情况不明的情况下，这招总能奏效。可随后，贝雷斯福德先生又清醒地意识到了自己矮小的身材和小心谨慎的天性。贝雷斯福德先生做出了一个决定，最好的方式还是躲开这个男人。想到这点，贝雷斯福德先生镇定地走向了商店的大门，打算经过戴轻便帽男人的身边，出门去坐公交车回家。

他还没走到戴轻便帽男人的身边，一个店员就绕过柜台，带着亲切的微笑径直向贝雷斯福德先生迎了过去，用激越的声音说道：“看到您中意的东西了吗，先生？”

“今晚没有，谢谢！”贝雷斯福德先生边说边挪开身子，打算避开这个店员，但是店员也同样挪动脚步，又凑了上来，说道：“还有些好东西您没看到呢。”

“不，谢谢！”贝雷斯福德先生说道，力图使他的高音听起来更加坚定。

“还是看一看吧。”店员坚持道。这个店员身上有股非同寻常的执拗劲。贝雷斯福德先生抬起头，看见戴轻便帽的男人在他的右边，向他逼近。他向两个人的身后望去，发现店里已经空无一人了，大街看上去也离得很远，两个不同方向的行人身影变得越来越小。贝雷斯福德先生意识到自己在那两个人的步步紧逼下，正在被迫往后退。

“小心行事。”戴轻便帽的男人对店员说道。他们继续慢慢地靠了过来。

“你们要干什么？”贝雷斯福德先生紧张地说道，但是声音中透着常人身陷危机时的无能为力感。他仍然紧握着腋下的糖果盒，“你们干什么。”他说道，感受着他身后的墙壁坚实的重量。

“准备。”戴轻便帽的男人说道。两个男人跃跃欲试，贝雷斯福德先生大叫一声，从两个人的空隙中钻了过去，跑向了大门。随后，他听见身后传来一种犹如咆哮的声音，以及一阵子追来的脚步声。“我到了大街上就安全了，”当他出了门来到大街上涌动的人流中时，心中想道：“只要人多，他们就不能把我怎么样了。”他一边回头看着，一边走在了一个带着很多包裹的胖女人和一对勾肩搭背的青年男女中间，他看见店员站在商店的门前，眼光跟随着他，而戴轻便帽的男人已不在视线当中了。贝雷斯福德先生把糖果盒换了一下胳膊，空出了右胳膊。他想：太愚蠢了，在光天化日之下，他们怎能妄想带走……

戴轻便帽的男人就在前面不远处的角落等着，贝雷斯福德先生有些犹豫地放慢了脚步，然后，转念一想，这真荒谬可笑，街上人这么多，大家都在看着，他大胆地沿着街道走了过去。戴轻便帽的男人没有看他，很平静地靠着一栋建筑点着了一根香烟。贝雷斯福德先生走到街角时，突然快速地冲到了街上，大声喊叫着：“出租车！”他从来不知道自己究竟为什么能够发出那么大的声音。一辆好像不敢漠视这声大叫的出租车停了下来。谢天谢地！贝雷斯福德先生跑向了它，当他的手放在车门把手上时，另一个人的手也伸了过来，贝雷斯福德先生能清楚地感受到帽子檐划过了他的脸颊。

“要上就快上。”出租车司机说道。车门开了，有人要把他使劲推上车，贝雷斯福德先生反抗着，把手从另一个人的手里抽出来，跑回了人行道。一辆跨区公交车已经停在了街角，贝雷斯福德先生不假思索地匆忙上了车，把一枚五分的硬币投入售票机中，走到公交车的后部坐了下来。戴轻便帽的男人就坐在前面不远的地方，在贝雷斯福德先生和车门之间的位置。贝雷斯福德先生把糖果盒放到了他的膝盖上，想努力理清头绪。显然，戴轻便帽的男人可能对他并无恶意，那个几乎是无意识的摸嘴的举动也并没有引起那个男人的不满，除非他特别敏感。在任何情况下，纪念品店里自然会有店员；贝雷斯福德先生突然认识到纪念品店里的店员行为举止确实非常奇怪。然后，他把考虑店员的念头放到了一边，心思又回到了戴轻便帽的男人身上。如果摸嘴的动作没有任何的侮辱之意，那又会是什么呢？紧接着，另一个想法让贝雷斯福德先生不寒而栗：那么，戴轻便帽的男人尾随他有多长时间了？他回想了一整天的经历：他和一群人一起离开了办公室，大家一路开心地聊着，还不忘提醒他今天是他夫人的生日，他们一直陪着贝雷斯福德先生走到糖果店，然后他一个人留在店里买东西。他整个白天几乎都待在办公室里，除了和办公室的三个同事一起出去吃了个午餐。贝雷斯福德先生的思路一下子从午餐又跳到了他在公交车站第一眼看见戴轻便帽男人时的情景。那个男人好像要把他推上公交车，而不是自己先挤上去。如果真是那样，一旦他上了公交车……贝雷斯福德先生四下看了一下，他正坐着的这趟公交车上只剩下五个乘客了。一个是司机，一个是他自己，一个是戴轻便帽的男人，司机和那个男人都坐在贝雷斯福德先生的前面不远处。另外两位乘客，一个是拿着很多购物袋的老太太，一个是看上去像是外国人的男人。外国人，贝雷斯福德先生看了他一眼，一下子想到了外国人、外国的阴谋、间谍。最好别相信外国人，贝雷斯福德先生思量到。

公交车在两旁高大、黢黑的建筑物中飞快地穿行。贝雷斯福德先生看着车窗外，很显然他们现在在一个工厂区，他记得他们一直在往东走，决定到下一个光线好的、热闹的街区就下车。看着车开进越来越黑暗的地方，贝雷斯福德先生注意到了一个奇怪的情况：街角矗立着的公交牌子旁有人在等车，而车根本没停，甚至等车的人在光线暗淡处挥着手，这辆公交车也没停。贝雷斯福德先生吃惊地瞟了一眼街边的标识牌，注意到上面写着“东31街”，与此同时，他拉了车铃，示意司机他要下车。当他站起身，沿着过道走向车门的时候，那个外国人模样的人也站了起来，走向司机旁边的车门。“下车。”外国人说道，公交车减速了。贝雷斯福德先生侧身向前，但老太太的购物袋挡在了过道上，袋子一下倒了，小东西撒了一地——一套积木，一盒曲别针——撒得到处都是。

“对不起。”贝雷斯福德先生绝望地说道。这时，公交车的车门开了。他又开始向前挪动脚步了，而老太太抓住了他的胳膊说道：“如果你着急的话，不用麻烦替我捡，我能搞定，亲爱的。”贝雷斯福德先生试图甩开她的手，而她继续说道：“如果你到站了，不用担心，完全没有关系。”

一卷粉色的缎带缠绕在了贝雷斯福德先生的鞋上，老太太道歉道：“瞧我笨手笨脚的，就让袋子暂时那样放在过道上吧。”

当贝雷斯福德先生挣脱开时，车门咣地关上了，公交车也开始动了。贝雷斯福德先生打消了下车的念头，在摇摇晃晃的车上单膝着地开始捡曲别针、积木，可一盒信纸又散开了，信纸和信封在地板上被撒得到处都是，“对不起，”老太太亲切地说道，“这都是我的错。”

再一次，一扭头，贝雷斯福德先生看见戴轻便帽的男人正舒舒服服地坐在那里。他吸着烟，头向后仰着，眼睛闭着。贝雷斯福德先生尽可能地把老太太的东西都拾掇好了。然后，他又走上前站在了司机身边。“下车。”贝雷斯福德先生说道。

“在街区中央不能停车。”司机头也不回地说道。

“那就下一站吧。”贝雷斯福德先生说道。

公交车快速地向前开着，贝雷斯福德先生略微蹲下身子，从前面的车窗去看外面的街道，看见了一块牌子上写着“公交车站”。

“就这儿吧。”他说道。

“什么？”司机问道，外面的车站牌一闪而过。

“听着，”贝雷斯福德先生说道，“我要下车。”

“好吧，”司机说道，“下一站。”

“你刚过了一站。”贝雷斯福德先生说道。

“车站没人等车，”司机说道，“而且，你也没及时告诉我。”贝雷斯福德先生耐下性子等着，过了一会儿，他看到了另一个公交车站牌，赶紧说道：“好了，停车。”

公交车没有停，经过车站时连一点儿减速的意思都没有。

“去投诉我吧。”司机说。

“现在，你给我听着。”贝雷斯福德先生说道，而司机则翻着白眼斜睨着他，似乎觉得很好玩。

“去投诉我好了，”司机说道，“我的工作证号就在这张卡上。”

“如果你下一站还不停车的话，”贝雷斯福德先生说道，“我会打碎车门玻璃，大喊救命。”

“用什么打？”司机冷笑道，“这盒糖果吗？”

“你怎么知道它是……”贝雷斯福德先生问道，可他马上意识到，如果他开始聊天的话，可能又会错过一个公交车站。除了到达公交车站，对司机能让他随时下车他想都不敢想。他看见了前面的灯光，同时公交车开始减速了。贝雷斯福德先生向后快速地看了一眼，看见戴轻便帽的男人伸了伸懒腰，站了起来。

公交车在站牌前方停了下来，那儿有一排商店。

“好了，”公交车司机对贝雷斯福德先生说道，“你那么着急下车。”戴轻便帽的男人从后门那儿站起身，贝雷斯福德先生站在车开着的前车门口，迟疑地说道：“我想我还要在车上坐一会儿。”

“终点站，”公交车司机说道，“每个人都得下车。”他嘲弄似的抬头看着贝雷斯福德先生。“如果你想投诉我就去投诉吧，”他说道，“我的号码就在那边的卡上。”

贝雷斯福德先生下了车，径直走向那个戴轻便帽的男人，他正站在人行道上。“这也太可笑了，”他强调说，“我一点儿也不明白，我想让你知道，一看见警察，我就……”

他停住了，因为他意识到那个戴轻便帽的男人并没有看他，而是有点儿厌烦但又目不转睛地看着他身后。贝雷斯福德先生转过身去，看见一个警察正站在街角。

“你等着。”他对那个戴轻便帽的男人说道，开始向警察走去。可走到一半的时候，他心中又开始打起了鼓：他要跟警察说什么？当他要下车时，公交车不停车，纪念品商店的店员逼迫顾客，戴着轻便帽子的神秘男人，——为什么？贝雷斯福德先生突然认识到他没什么可以告诉警察的。他回过头去，看见那个戴轻便帽的男人正在盯着他。这时，贝雷斯福德先生突然像箭一般飞奔到地铁的入口。此时，他手上攥着五分硬币，三步并作两步地下了台阶，快速地通过了隔栏，左侧是通往市区的地铁线，他跑向了这边。

他一边跑一边合计：如果我奔向市区方向，他会认为我很愚蠢；如果我更聪明一些，我会奔向市郊；如果我真的聪明，我会去市区。他觉得我是聪明呢还是非常聪明？

那个戴轻便帽的男人在贝雷斯福德先生到达地铁站台之后的几秒钟里，就也到了那里，他的手放到口袋里，在站台上溜达。而贝雷斯福德先生无精打采地坐在一张长条凳上。“那不好，”他心想，“那一点儿也不好，他知道我有多聪明。”

地铁列车隆隆地进了站，贝雷斯福德先生跑着进了地铁车门，眼睛瞄见那个男人消失在了另一节车厢的门内。就在门刚要关上那一刻，贝雷斯福德先生扑了过去，扒住了门，要不是一个女孩抓住他的胳膊喊叫着：“哈里！看在上帝的分上，你要去哪儿呀？”他应该已经跳出了车厢。

贝雷斯福德先生的身体卡在门的中间，他的胳膊被女孩抓住，留在了车厢里。女孩似乎用尽了全身的力气抓着他，“这可不好，”她对车厢里的其他乘客说道，“他确信不想去见他的老朋友们了。”

有几个人笑了起来，而大多数的人在看着他们。

“紧紧抓住他，姐们。”有人喊道。

女孩笑了，用力拉着贝雷斯福德先生的胳膊，“他想跑。”她笑着对车厢里的人说道。一个膀大腰圆的男人开口笑着走过来，说道：“如果你那么需要他，我们帮你把他拽进来。”

贝雷斯福德先生觉得抓在他胳膊上的力道突然大得不可抗拒，一下子就把他从门中间给拉了进来，车厢门也在他身后关上了。这时，车厢中的每个人都冲他哈哈大笑起来。那个大个子的男人说道：“可不应该这样对待一位女士，好朋友。”

贝雷斯福德先生四下看了看，想找到那个女孩，但是她已经消失在了人群中，列车这时开始移动了。过了一会儿，车厢中的人不再关注他了，贝雷斯福德先生整理了一下外套，发现他的糖果盒依然完好。

地铁列车向市区疾驰。贝雷斯福德先生现在绞尽脑汁想着侦探们常用的手段，神秘故事中的躲闪术，似乎想到了一个万全之策。当列车驶向市区时，他乖乖地待在车厢中，他买的是到二十三街区的票，可在十四街区时他就下车了。他走上楼梯，来到大街上，戴轻便帽的男人还在跟着他。正如他所料，他前面的大百货商店正打着“开门至晚上九点”的广告，大门开着，随着人流不断的进进出出，门前后摆动。贝雷斯福德先生走了进去。刚开始，这家店让他有点儿不知所措——柜台长长的一大溜，各个方向上都有，里面的灯光也比别的地方亮得多，人声鼎沸。贝雷斯福德先生沿着一个柜台的边缘慢慢挪动脚步，起初的柜台卖的是长筒袜，薄薄的肉色的、纱似的黑色的；接下去是手提包，有的是成摞卖的，有的是在隔架中一个一个卖的；再下去是医疗用品，站在柜台里的是一个巨大的人体模型，过来买东西的人免不了尴尬。贝雷斯福德先生转过一个角落，来到了杂货用品柜台前，有些丝巾太廉价，所以甚至都没有放到丝巾柜台中去，而摆放到了这里。柜台中有明信片，以及一个容器，上面标注着“里面所有商品的直径都是25毫米”。这里还有墨镜，虽然戴墨镜不是很舒服，但贝雷斯福德先生还是买了一副并戴上了。

他从距离他进来的门很远的另一扇门出了商店，他本来可以选择从八或九个出入口中的任何一个出来，但是这个出入口似乎比较复杂。他看不见那个戴轻便帽的男人了，直到贝雷斯福德先生走到出租车载客处，也没人试图妨碍他。虽然他仔细考虑过坐第二辆还是第三辆出租车，但最后还是坐上了一辆主动上来揽活的出租车，告诉了司机他家的地址。




他一路平安地到了自己家的公寓楼，小心翼翼地从出租车里下来进了大堂。这儿再也见不到戴轻便帽的男人了，也没有奇怪的人注视着贝雷斯福德先生了。电梯里就他一个人，没人会看见他按的是哪一层，贝雷斯福德先生长长地舒了口气，开始好奇他这段狂乱的回家之旅会不会是一场梦魇。他按响了公寓的门铃，等待着。他的妻子来到门前给他开了门，贝雷斯福德先生进了家门，突然觉得快要累瘫了。

“你今天回来得太晚了，亲爱的，”他妻子温情脉脉地说道，然后又问道，“出了什么事了吗？”

他看着她，她身上穿着蓝色的长裙，说明她知道今天是她的生日，指望他能带她出去。他四肢无力地把糖果盒递给了她，她接了过来。他几乎没注意到她的担心。“究竟出什么事了？”她问道，“亲爱的，快来这儿坐下，你看上去太糟糕了。”

他让她领着进了起居室，坐到了自己舒服的椅子上，他仰脸躺下。

“出了什么事吗？”她焦急地问道，在他身上瞎忙活了一气，松了松他的领带，捋了捋他的头发，“你病了吗？你遇到了一场事故？发生了什么事？”

他意识到他似乎比他表现出来的还要累，受到这种关注也很得意。他深深地叹了口气，说道：“没事，没什么大不了的事，我待一会儿告诉你。”

“等一下，”她说道，“我去给你拿点儿喝的。”

当她出去以后，他又把头靠在了柔软的椅子背上。他从来不知道起居室的门竟然还有钥匙，可在她离开时，他在潜意识下模模糊糊听到了钥匙转动的声音。这时，他悄悄站了起来，把头贴到门上，听到她在客厅里打电话。

她拨了号码，等了一会儿，然后说道：“听着，”她说道，“听着，他终于回来了。我已经稳住他了。”





Janice


First, to me on the phone, in a half-amused melancholy:“Guess I'm not going back to school...”

“Why not, Jan?”

“Oh, my mother. She says we can't afford it.” How can I reproduce the uncaring inflections of Janice's voice, saying conversationally that what she wanted she could not have? “So I guess I'm not going back.”

“I'm so sorry, Jan.”

But then, struck by another thought: “Y'know what?”

“What?”

“Darn near killed myself this afternoon.”

“Jan! How?”

Almost whimsical, indifferent: “Locked myself in the garage and turned on the car motor.”

“But why?”

“I dunno. 'Cause I couldn't go back, I suppose.”

“What happened?”

“Oh, the fellow that was cutting our lawn heard the motor and came and got me. I was pretty near out.”

“But that's terrible, Jan. What ever possessed—”

“Oh, well. Say—” changing again, “—going to Sally's tonight?”

And, later, that night at Sally's where Janice was not the center of the group, but sat talking to me and to Bob: “Nearly killed myself this afternoon, Bob.”

“What!”

Lightly: “Nearly killed myself. Locked myself in the garage with the car motor running.”

“But why, Jan?”

“I guess because they wouldn't let me go back to school.”

“Oh, I'm sorry about that, Jan. But what about this afternoon? What did you do?”

“Man cutting the grass got me out.”

Sally coming over: “What's this, Jan?”

“Oh, I'm not going back to school.”

Myself, cutting in: “How did it feel to be dying, Jan?”

Laughing “Gee, funny. All black.” Then, to Sally's incredulous stare: “Nearly killed myself this afternoon, Sally...”





A Cauliflower in Her Hair


Mr. and Mrs. Garland and their daughter Virginia lived in a pleasant house in a pretty town and every night at seven they ate the agreeable dinner cooked by Agnes, the maid who cooked well and dusted adequately and made beds abominably. Mr. and Mrs. Garland belonged to two country clubs and Mr. Garland had a mustache; Mrs. Garland had given up evening gowns in favor of dinner dresses and had two fur coats, a leopard and an inferior mink. Virginia was in first year high school and went out with the captain of the basketball team. Every Saturday night Mr. Garland shook hands with this young man and they chatted jovially about the war until Virginia came down the stairs wearing her mother's perfume. Virginia was fifteen years old, Mr. Garland was thirty-nine, and Mrs. Garland was forty-one.

One evening at dinner—it would have been about twenty minutes past seven—Virginia remarked: “Mother, Millie said she'd be around tonight. Can I skip helping Agnes with the dishes?”

“What is Millie?” Mr. Garland inquired, regarding the cauliflower Agnes was offering, “a cow?”

Virginia giggled. “She looks a little bit like one,” she said. “Only she isn't. She's Millie, from school, She's coming over and we're going to do algebra.”

“Millie can wait while you help Agnes,” Mrs. Garland said. She looked at Virginia to make Virginia realize that Agnes must be kept in good humor. “It doesn't take ten minutes, and Millie can wait.”

“I'll entertain Millie,” Mr. Garland said helpfully, “Millie and I will do all your algebra. Used to be quite a hand at algebra,” he told Mrs. Garland solemnly.

“You're still quite a hand at talk,” Mrs. Garland said. “Take some cauliflower before it gets too cold. Agnes has to have some too, you know.”

“Millie hasn't been in school long,” Virginia said. “She didn't come until the second semester and I'm helping her catch up.”

“Very kind of you,” Mr. Garland said.

The doorbell rang, and Virginia dropped her napkin. “When she says early she means early,” she said.

“That would be Millie?” Mr. Garland inquired.

Virginia answered the door and Mr. and Mrs. Garland could hear her voice for a minute in the hall. Then she came back into the dining room, leading Millie. Millie was pretty and stupid-looking, and she had heavy black eyelashes and wore a great deal of lipstick.

“This is my mother and father,” Virginia said, sliding into her chair, “this is Millie. Pull up a chair, Millie.”

Mrs. Garland frowned slightly. “Have you had your dinner, Millie?”

“Yes,” Millie said. She looked at Virginia and giggled. “I ought to wait in the living room,” she said, “but Ginny said to come right on in.”

“Of course,” Mr. Garland said, “have some cauliflower?”

Millie giggled again, staring at Mr. Garland.

“If you don't care to eat it,” Mr. Garland said, “you could wear it in your hair.”

“My father never takes anything seriously,” Virginia said to Millie. “He's like that all the time, don't mind him.”

“Maybe you'll have some dessert with us, Millie?” Mrs. Garland said.

“No, thank you,” Millie said.

“If you eat anything,” Mr. Garland scowled ferociously at Millie, “you'll have to wash dishes. Anyone eats in this house, right after dinner they have to go out in the kitchen and wash dishes.”

“Charles!” Mrs. Garland said. “You'll frighten the child.”

“Millie isn't scared of anything, Mother,” Virginia said, “Millie and I can do anything.”

“I'll bet Millie can do anything,” Mr. Garland said. Mrs. Garland looked up.

“Virginia,” she said finally, “since you and Millie have to do algebra I'll explain to Agnes and she won't mind if you don't help her.”

“Hallelujah,” Virginia said. “Come on, Millie. Be excused, Mother?”

Mrs. Garland nodded and Virginia slid off her chair and ran out of the dining room, waving Millie to follow her.

Mr. and Mrs. Garland were quiet for a little while after Virginia and Millie had left the room, until finally Mrs. Garland remarked: “She doesn't seem like an awfully nice girl, does she, this Millie?”

“I don't know,” Mr. Garland said, putting down his coffee cup, “she looked all right to me.”

Mr. and Mrs. Garland were sitting quietly in the living room some time later, Mrs. Garland doing needlepoint—she was making a footstool—and Mr. Garland reading the Saturday Evening Post, when Virginia and Millie, heralded by a clatter of feet from upstairs, burst into the room.

“Mother,” Virginia cried as she came, “Mother, we finished our homework and can we go down and get a soda, Mother?”

Mrs. Garland thought. “I suppose so,” she said slowly, “only hurry back.”

“Wait,” Mr. Garland said reaching into his pocket, “bring back some ice cream and we'll all have some. Mother and I would like some ice cream.”

“I don't think…” Mrs. Garland said.

Virginia rushed over and grabbed the money from her father's hand. “Back in two seconds,” she said, and she and Millie ran out again.

“They do rush around so, don't they,” Mrs. Garland said, turning back to her needlework.

“They're young,” Mr. Garland said, “let them have their fun.”

“I don't think we should encourage Millie as a friend for Virginia,” Mrs. Garland said, “she doesn't seem to be quite a nice girl.”

“She seems all right to me,” Mr. Garland said.

Millie and Virginia put the ice cream in dishes and brought it in to Mr. and Mrs. Garland. Mr. Garland received his with disgust. “Why should Millie,” he inquired, “get away with so much and only leave this little bit for me?”

Millie giggled. “I don't have one bit more than you do, Mr. Garland.”

“I dished it out myself,” Virginia said.

“You certainly do, Millie,” Mr. Garland went on, “I got robbed.” He went over to Millie to compare dishes and sat down next to her on the couch. “Now I'm going to sit right down here,” he said, “and watch every bit you eat, and count how much you have, and then you'll be sorry you didn't let me have more.”

Millie giggled again. “Stop, Mr. Garland,” she said, “I'm choking.”

“Charles,” Mrs. Garland said, “you're spoiling the girl's good time.”

“No, Mrs. Garland,” Millie said, “I think Mr. Garland's awfully funny.”

“Now I'm funny,” Mr. Garland said. “First you rob me of my ice cream and then you think I'm funny. Just a silly old man, I guess.”

“You're not an old man,” Millie said.

“He's old enough not to act like a clown,” Mrs. Garland said sharply.

“I don't think you're old at all,” Millie protested, “really, I think you're young.”

Mr. Garland eyed Millie. “How young would you say?” he demanded.

Millie giggled.

“My father's always like that,” Virginia said to Millie. “He's always fooling people.”

“Wouldn't go out with a guy my age, would you, Millie?” Mr. Garland said.

Millie looked up at him. “I couldn't say,” she said.

“Now don't tease me,” Mr. Garland said.

Mrs. Garland rose, put down her sewing, and went to the door. In the doorway she stopped for a minute. “Virginia,” she said, without turning around, “I want to speak to you for a minute, please.”

Virginia got up and followed her mother out of the room. “Be right with you, Millie,” she said.

When Virginia was gone Millie turned around to Mr. Garland. “Is Mrs. Garland mad about something I said or something?” she asked.

“Don't pay any attention to her,” Mr. Garland said. He touched the flower in Millie's hair. “Pretty flower,” he said.

“My boy friend gave it to me,” Millie said.

“Got a boy friend?” Mr. Garland said. “Does he take you out and show you a good time?”

Millie giggled. “He sure does,” she said.

“Where does he take you?” Mr. Garland asked. “Ever take you to this place downtown, this club they call The Blue Lantern?”

“I've been there,” Millie said.

Mr. Garland got up and walked across the room to get a cigarette and, as an afterthought, offered one to Millie.

“She coming back?” Millie asked, her hand out.

“Mrs. Garland? Not for a minute or two, probably.” Millie took the cigarette and Mr. Garland lit it for her.

“She doesn't like me,” Millie said, leaning back.

“I shouldn't think so,” Mr. Garland said.

“But Virginia's a swell kid,” Millie said. Mr. Garland laughed, and Millie looked up at him. “What did I say?” she asked.

Virginia came into the doorway and stopped for a minute.

“Millie,” she said, and Millie juggled Mr. Garland's hand insistently to make him take her cigarette. “Millie,” Virginia said, “Mother wants to know if we will run down and get her a couple of things at the store. Want to go?”

Millie hesitated, and Mrs. Garland came into the doorway behind Virginia. “Charles,” she said, “I told Virginia that if she and Millie went down to the store for me like good children you'd give them each a dime.”

“We'll get a soda,” Virginia said.

“After all that ice cream?” Mrs. Garland asked tolerantly. “You'd like to have a dime, wouldn't you, Millie?”

Millie hesitated. “Come on, Millie,” Virginia said impatiently. “Daddy, give us a dime.”

Mr. Garland looked at his wife, and reached into his pocket and took out a quarter. “Here,” he said.

Virginia came over and took the quarter and then grabbed Millie's arm and started her toward the door.

Mrs. Garland sat down and picked up her sewing again. “Charles,” she said, “don't you think the children are having too much ice cream?”





Come Dance with Me in Ireland


Young Mrs. Archer was sitting on the bed with Kathy Valentine and Mrs. Corn, playing with the baby and gossiping, when the doorbell rang. Mrs. Archer, saying, “Oh, dear!” went to push the buzzer that released the outside door of the apartment building. “We had to live on the ground floor,” she called to Kathy and Mrs. Corn. “Everybody rings our bell for everything.”

When the inner doorbell rang she opened the door of the apartment and saw an old man standing in the outer hall. He was wearing a long, shabby black overcoat and had a square white beard. He held out a handful of shoelaces.

“Oh,” Mrs. Archer said. “Oh, I'm terribly sorry, but—”

“Madam,” the old man said, “if you would be so kind. A nickel apiece.”

Mrs. Archer shook her head and backed away. “I'm afraid not,” she said.

“Thank you anyway, Madam,” he said, “for speaking courteously. The first person on this block who has been decently polite to a poor old man.”

Mrs. Archer turned the doorknob back and forth nervously. “I'm awfully sorry,” she said. Then, as he turned to go, she said, “Wait a minute,” and hurried into the bedroom. “Old man selling shoelaces,” she whispered. She pulled open the top dresser drawer, took out her pocketbook, and fumbled in the change purse. “Quarter,” she said. “Think it's all right?”

“Sure,” Kathy said. “Probably more than he's gotten all day.” She was Mrs. Archer's age, and unmarried. Mrs. Corn was a stout woman in her middle fifties. They both lived in the building and spent a good deal of time at Mrs. Archer's, on account of the baby.

Mrs. Archer returned to the front door. “Here,” she said, holding out the quarter. “I think it's a shame everyone was so rude.”

The old man started to offer her some shoelaces, but his hand shook and the shoelaces dropped to the floor. He leaned heavily against the wall. Mrs. Archer watched, horrified, “Good Lord,” she said, and put out her hand. As her fingers touched the dirty old overcoat she hesitated and then, tightening her lips, she put her arm firmly through his and tried to help him through the doorway. “Girls,” she called, “come help me, quick!”

Kathy came running out of the bedroom, saying, “Did you call, Jean?” and then stopped dead, staring.

“What'll I do?” Mrs. Archer said, standing with her arm through the old man's. His eyes were closed and he seemed barely able, with her help, to stand on his feet. “For heaven's sake, grab him on the other side.”

“Get him to a chair or something,” Kathy said. The hall was too narrow for all three of them to go down side by side, so Kathy took the old man's other arm and half-led Mrs. Archer and him into the living-room. “Not in the good chair,” Mrs. Archer exclaimed. “In the old leather one.” They dropped the old man into the leather chair and stood back. “What on earth do we do now?” Mrs. Archer said.

“Do you have any whiskey?” Kathy asked.

Mrs. Archer shook her head. “A little wine,” she said doubtfully.

Mrs. Corn came into the living-room, holding the baby. “Gracious!” she said. “He's drunk!”

“Nonsense,” Kathy said. “I wouldn't have let Jean bring him in if he were.”

“Watch out for the baby, Blanche,” Mrs. Archer said.

“Naturally,” Mrs. Corn said. “We're going back into the bedroom, honey,” she said to the baby, “and then we're going to get into our lovely crib and go beddy-bye.”

The old man stirred and opened his eyes. He tried to get up.

“Now you stay right where you are,” Kathy ordered, “and Mrs. Archer here is going to bring you a little bit of wine. You'd like that, wouldn't you?”

The old man raised his eyes to Kathy. “Thank you,” he said.

Mrs. Archer went into the kitchen. After a moment's thought she took the glass from over the sink, rinsed it out, and poured some sherry into it. She took the glass of sherry back into the living-room and handed it to Kathy.

“Shall I hold it for you or can you drink by yourself?” Kathy asked the old man.

“You are much too kind,” he said, and reached for the glass. Kathy steadied it for him as he sipped from it, and then he pushed it away.

“That's enough, thank you,” he said. “Enough to revive me.” He tried to rise. “Thank you,” he said to Mrs. Archer, “and thank you,” to Kathy. “I had better be going along.”

“Not until you're quite firm on your feet,” Kathy said. “Can't afford to take chances, you know.”

The old man smiled. “I can afford to take chances,” he said.

Mrs. Corn came back into the living-room. “Baby's in his crib,” she said, “and just about asleep already. Does he feel better now? I'll bet he was just drunk or hungry or something.”

“Of course he was,” Kathy said, fired by the idea. “He was hungry. That's what was wrong all the time, Jean. How silly we were. Poor old gentleman!” she said to the old man. “Mrs. Archer is certainly not going to let you leave here without a full meal inside of you.”

Mrs. Archer looked doubtful. “I have some eggs,” she said.

“Fine!” Kathy said. “Just the thing. They're easily digested,” she said to the old man, “and especially good if you haven't eaten for”—she hesitated—“for a while.”

“Black coffee,” Mrs. Corn said, “if you ask me. Look at his hands shake.”

“Nervous exhaustion,” Kathy said firmly. “A nice hot cup of bouillon is all he needs to be good as ever, and he has to drink it very slowly until his stomach gets used to food again. The stomach,” she told Mrs. Archer and Mrs. Corn, “shrinks when it remains empty for any great period of time.”

“I would rather not trouble you,” the old man said to Mrs. Archer.

“Nonsense,” Kathy said. “We've got to see that you get a good hot meal to go on with.” She took Mrs. Archer's arm and began to walk her out to the kitchen. “Just some eggs,” she said. “Fry four or five. I'll get you half a dozen later. I don't suppose you have any bacon. I'll tell you, fry up a few potatoes too. He won't care if they're half-raw. These people eat things like heaps of fried potatoes and eggs and—”

“There's some canned figs left over from lunch,” Mrs. Archer said. “I was wondering what to do with them.”

“I've got to run back and keep an eye on him,” Kathy said. “He might faint again or something. You just fry up those eggs and potatoes. I'll send Blanche out if she'll come.”

Mrs. Archer measured out enough coffee for two cups and set the pot on the stove. Then she took out her frying pan. “Kathy,” she said, “I'm just a little worried. If he really is drunk, I mean, and if Jim should hear about it, with the baby here and everything...”

“Why, Jean!” Kathy said. “You should live in the country for a while, I guess. Women always give out meals to starving men, And you don't need to tell Jim. Blanche and I certainly won't say anything.”

“Well,” said Mrs. Archer, “you're sure he isn't drunk?”

“I know a starving man when I see one,” Kathy said. “When an old man like that can't stand up and his hands shake and he looks so funny, that means he's starving to death. Literally starving.”

“Oh, my!” said Mrs. Archer. She hurried to the cupboard under the sink and took out two potatoes. “Two enough, do you think? I guess we're really doing a good deed.”

Kathy giggled. “Just a bunch of Girl Scouts,” she said. She started out of the kitchen, and then she stopped and turned around. “You have any pie? They always eat pie.”

“It was for dinner, though,” Mrs. Archer said.

“Oh, give it to him,” Kathy said. “We can run out and get some more after he goes.”

While the potatoes were frying, Mrs. Archer put a plate, a cup and saucer, and a knife and fork and spoon on the dinette table. Then, as an afterthought, she picked up the dishes and, taking a paper bag out of a cupboard, tore it in half and spread it smoothly on the table and put the dishes back. She got a glass and filled it with water from the bottle in the refrigerator, cut three slices of bread and put them on a plate, and then cut a small square of butter and put it on the plate with the bread. Then she got a paper napkin from the box in the cupboard and put it beside the plate, took it up after a minute to fold it into a triangular shape, and put it back. Finally she put the pepper and salt shakers on the table and got out a box of eggs. She went to the door and called, “Kathy! Ask him how does he want his eggs fried?”

There was a murmur of conversation in the living-room and Kathy called back, “Sunny side up!”

Mrs. Archer took out four eggs and then another and broke them one by one into the frying-pan. When they were done she called out, “All right, girls! Bring him in!”

Mrs. Corn came into the kitchen, inspected the plate of potatoes and eggs, and looked at Mrs. Archer without speaking. Then Kathy came, leading the old man by the arm. She escorted him to the table and sat him down in a chair. “There,” she said. “Now, Mrs. Archer's fixed you a lovely hot meal.”

The old man looked at Mrs. Archer. “I'm very grateful,” he said.

“Isn't that nice!” Kathy said. She nodded approvingly at Mrs. Archer. The old man regarded the plate of eggs and potatoes. “Now pitch right in,” Kathy said. “Sit down, girls. I'll get a chair from the bedroom.”

The old man picked up the salt and shook it gently over the eggs. “This looks delicious,” he said finally.

“You just go right ahead and eat,” Kathy said, reappearing with a chair. “We want to see you get filled up. Pour him some coffee, Jean.”

Mrs. Archer went to the stove and took up the coffeepot.

“Please don't bother,” he said.

“That's all right,” Mrs. Archer said, filling the old man's cup. She sat down at the table. The old man picked up the fork and then put it down again to take up the paper napkin and spread it carefully over his knees.

“What's your name?” Kathy asked.

“O'Flaherty, Madam. John O'Flaherty.”

“Well, John,” Kathy said, “I am Miss Valentine and this lady is Mrs. Archer and the other one is Mrs. Corn.”

“How do you do?” the old man said.

“I gather you're from the old country,” Kathy said.

“I beg your pardon?”

“Irish, aren't you?” Kathy said.

“I am, Madam.” The old man plunged the fork into one of the eggs and watched the yolk run out onto the plate. “I knew Yeats,” he said suddenly.

“Really?” Kathy said, leaning forward. “Let me see—he was the writer, wasn't he?”

“‘Come out of charity, come dance with me in Ireland,’” the old man said. He rose and, holding on to the chair back, bowed solemnly to Mrs. Archer, “Thank you again, Madam, for your generosity.” He turned and started for the front door. The three women got up and followed him.

“But you didn't finish,” Mrs. Corn said.

“The stomach,” the old man said, “as this lady has pointed out, shrinks. Yes, indeed,” he went on reminiscently, “I knew Yeats.”

At the front door he turned and said to Mrs. Archer, “Your kindness should not go unrewarded.” He gestured to the shoelaces lying on the floor. “These,” he said, “are for you. For your kindness. Divide them with the other ladies.”

“But I wouldn't dream—” Mrs. Archer began.

“I insist,” the old man said, opening the door. “A small return, but all that I have to offer. Pick them up yourself,” he added abruptly. Then he turned and thumbed his nose at Mrs. Corn. “I hate old women,” he said.

“Well!” said Mrs. Corn faintly.

“I may have imbibed somewhat freely,” the old man said to Mrs. Archer, “but I never served bad sherry to my guests. We are of two different worlds, Madam.”

“Didn't I tell you?” Mrs. Corn was saying. “Haven't I kept telling you all along?”

Mrs. Archer, her eyes on Kathy, made a tentative motion of pushing the old man through the door, but he forestalled her.

“‘Come dance with me in Ireland,’” he said. Supporting himself against the wall, he reached the outer door and opened it. “And time runs on,” he said.





It Isn't the Money I Mind


It was a sunny afternoon and the Park was nearly full. Old men and women sat on the benches; mothers sat idly beside baby carriages or watched children run shrieking over the grass. There were a lot of dogs walking up and down the paths on leashes or lying next to the benches. Except for the children, there was litde conversation and not much noise.

A man came into the Park from one of the side entrances. He stopped just inside the entrance to pat a dog on the head and speak to the owner, and then walked on slowly, looking for a place to sit down. He was middle-aged, partly bald, and, judging by his clothes, not very well off. As he walked he watched the people in the Park with a bright interest, stopping to listen to an argument between a mother and child, and later to pick up a ball for a group of older boys. One of them said, “Throw it back here, Mister,” and held out his hands. The man threw the ball clumsily and it bounced twice before the boy scooped it up. The boy said, “Thanks,” and turned and threw it easily far across the grass to another boy. The man watched for a minute and then walked on. Finally he stopped in front of a bench with an empty place at one end. Next to it sat a woman with a baby carriage. “May I sit here?” he asked. She looked up and said, “It's not taken,” and the man sat down. He sighed and sat still for a minute before reaching into his pocket for a cigarette.

The woman looked at him irritably and then turned away. A baby was lying in the carriage on its stomach, asleep, wearing only a diaper. The baby's back was brown, except for a sharp white edge where the diaper began. The woman was tirelessly rocking the carriage back and forth.

“Will the smoke bother the baby?” the man asked.

“I just got her to sleep,” the woman said. “Just about anything wakes her.”

The man leaned over and dropped the cigarette onto the ground and put his foot on it. “She looks like a fine, healthy baby,” he said.

The woman smiled. “She's only six months old,” she said, “and never even had a cold.”

“A fine baby,” the man said. “You see so many around here looking pale and white.”

“They're not healthy,” the woman said. “Some of the children in this park are really unhealthy.”

“It's hard for children in the city.”

“Their mothers should keep them out of the Park if they have things other children can catch,” the woman said.

While he was talking, the man had been fingering his billfold, riffling through the papers in it absent-mindedly. Now he pulled one out—a magazine clipping. “Want to see my little girl?” he asked.

The woman reached out with the hand that was not rocking the carriage. “Of course,” she said. “I could tell from the way you talked that you had one of your own.”

The clipping was of a little blond girl of about six, with a pretty, adult face and a lot of makeup. “She's lovely,” the woman said. “She has such a sweet face.”

“She's a nice kid,” the man said. He hesitated. “Know who she is?” he asked finally.

The woman shook her head.

“Her name's Angela Foster, now.”

“Of course,” the woman said. “In the movies!”

“That's right.” The man took the clipping and looked at it fondly. “It used to be Martin—that's my name. Her mother changed it. Angela Martin's not good for the movies,” he said.

“What a lucky little girl!” the woman said, reaching over to adjust the hood of the carriage. “In the movies!”

“She'll be a second Shirley Temple someday,” the man said, “She's got talent—everything.”

“You must be very proud of her.”

“I'll tell you,” the man began carefully, “I'm proud of her, of course. And it isn't the money I mind, either. She's making plenty right now and I don't grudge it to her. But it's like this. Before her mother took her out to Hollywood, I was always kicking about the dancing lessons and the singing lessons and the costumes and the late nights when her dancing class gave a recital. And now I know I just didn't have sense enough to see the baby had talent.”

“It's hard to tell,” the woman said. “All children have a natural sense of rhythm. Even at six months—”

“It isn't the money I mind,” the man said again. “I don't think a six-year-old girl should have to support her father.”

“Well, there's a lot of luck connected with it,” the woman said.

“I saw this article about her in a movie magazine,” the man went on. “It said she was five years old, but she must be six now. And she's already getting fan mail.”

“Really?” the woman said.

“I thought of writing to her and asking for a picture,” the man said. “Her own father.”

“I'm sure you'll be very proud of her,” the woman said. He reached into his pocket again for his cigarettes, and she frowned and shook her head. The man rose.

“I'll just finish my walk while I smoke this,” he said. He smiled at the woman and leaned over the carriage for a minute. “Such a pretty baby,” he said. He bowed slightly to the woman and went rapidly down the path.

When the man got around the next turn, he began to walk more slowly. A little boy just learning to walk staggered out from a bench and grabbed him by the leg. The man said, “Where you going, Champ?” turned the little boy around, and started him back to his mother. The man stopped for a minute to watch a checker game and then went on again, only to stop a minute later and help a little girl of about two push her stroller around a difficult turn. The man called her “honey.” Her mother, who was standing nearby, thanked him and he said, “Lovely little girl.” The mother smiled and went on, pulling the little girl and talking to her as she went.

The broad circle the man had been making had by now taken him back in the direction he had come from. As he passed the group of boys playing ball, he saw the ball strike a tree and bounce in his direction. He scooped it up awkwardly and, holding it in his hand, walked over to the boys. They were waiting impatiently for the ball, and as he stepped across a low railing and handed the ball to the nearest, he smiled apologetically and said, “Don't have the muscle I used to.”

“Thanks,” the boy said. He threw the ball and the boys began to scatter. One of them caught the ball and threw it to another. The man said, “Bud,” and the nearest boy turned around. The man, taking out his billfold, said, “Know who this is?” He pulled forth a newspaper clipping and held it out to the boy.

The boy glanced over his shoulder at his friends and then went over to the man. “Sure,” he said, looking at the clipping, but without making any attempt to hold it. “Nicky Lopez. The middleweight challenger.”

A couple of the boys nearby had also turned when the man called and now they came slowly over. “Nicky Lopez,” one of them said. “Let's see Nicky Lopez.” The man handed him the clipping and he looked at it and said professionally, “There's a guy that can fight.”

“He's pretty good,” another of the boys said, taking the clipping in turn.

“I used to manage Nicky,” the man said, watching the boys' heads turn slowly toward him. “Yeah,” he said reminiscently, “I used to manage Nicky, until the syndicate got him away from me.” He looked around at the boys and then went on, “It isn't the money I mind, you understand, but I sure hated to lose that boy.”





I Know Who I Love


Catharine Vincent began her life in a two-room apartment in New York; she was born in a minister's home in Buffalo; the shift from one to the other might be called her tragedy. When the devil prompted William Vincent to marry he did not prompt William further to inquire if his wife were to bear sons or daughters, or if the daughter were to be Catharine (named after William's mother, finally), thin and frightened, born with a scream and blue eyes.

When Catharine was twenty-three years old she found out that her father would have preferred a son, if he had to have any child at all. At that time she was still thin and noticeably frightened, with blue eyes and a faint talent for painting. She had eventually gone to New York alone; by the time she was self-supporting she had nearly forgotten her father, and her mother was dying.

William Vincent was a short heavy man, who affected a large mustache, which he thought made him look more the master of his house. He had become a minister shortly before his marriage because he had a vague feeling that in that way he was somehow certain of being right, and virtuous, and easily sure of his authority. He was not afraid of his wife, who was the only daughter of a grocer with no money, but he was afraid of the lady next door, and the brisk young man at the bank, and the butcher's delivery boy who made faces over unpaid bills, and asked insolent questions for which he could not be rebuked. William Vincent regarded his daughter as an unnecessary expense, as a trap, and as no true expression of God's will. He thought of his wife as an amiable woman whose place was in the home; practically the only person he felt really close to was God, in the heavy Bibles and the ponderous words, in the shabby church and the cheap hymns. Catharine early grew accustomed to hearing her father say across his small desk, or along the dull dinner table, “Do you think you are satisfactory, in God's sight or mine?”

After Catharine left home, while the train was pulling out of the station, she stopped thinking about her father and mother, except, later, for a weekly letter home. (“I am fine now, my cold is all gone at last. My job is fine, and they said it was all right about my being away three days. I guess I won't be able to leave work again for a while, so cannot expect to come home just yet.”) Her father across the desk, her mother's small timid laugh, were emphatically and resolutely put out of her mind, until she was twenty-three and her mother died.

The doctor was there and Catharine waited outside in the apartment-house hall while the doctor and her mother spent the last few minutes together. “She never spoke at all,” the doctor said. “She died very peacefully, Miss Vincent.”

“Good,” Catharine said. Her mother had waited until spring to die; next year she could have a fur coat. “What do I have to do about making arrangements?” she asked the doctor, waving her hand vaguely. “About burying her, and so on?”

The doctor looked at Catharine for a minute. “I'll help you with all that,” he said.

Catharine spoke to strange people with soft voices, who told her she was brave, or patted her hand and told her her mother was happier now. “She's with your dear father,” the maid in the apartment house said to Catharine, “They're together again at last.”

With the funeral over and her mother gone, Catharine put the apartment back the way it had been before her mother came to live with her. The extra bed was moved out and the little table went back by the window. She spent five dollars on a new slip cover for the armchair, and she had the curtains cleaned. The only thing left of her mother was the old trunk full of her mother's memories and hopes. The little money from the sale of the furniture stored in Buffalo had paid for the funeral; Catharine had paid for the doctor and the medicine out of her salary and her fur-coat money. She asked the superintendent to put her mother's trunk in the basement storage room, and the evening before he took it down she opened it, to make sure everything was in moth balls and to take out anything she could use, and, finally, to set her mind dutifully to thinking of her parents.

For a minute or two her parents' memory would be centered in a flood of other memories, the thin teacher who snatched the drawing out of Catharine's hand and snarled, “I should have known better than to assign this to a stupid halfwit.” Coming upon a boy named Freddie frantically rubbing out an inscription in chalk on a fence, and, when Freddie ran away, reading with hollow empty sympathy words he had been so anxiously erasing: “Catharine loves Freddie.” And then her father: “Catharine, do the girls and boys in your school talk to each other about bad things?” The one or two parties, and the flowered chiffon dress her mother made. Her father sending her next door to get back a nickel she had lent to a school friend. And her mother: “I hardly think, dear, that your father would approve of that little girl. Jane. If I were to speak to her, very tactfully...”

And herself, coming back someday, a famous artist with a secretary and gardenias, stepping off the train where they were all waiting for autographs. And there was Freddie, pressing forward, and Catharine, turning slightly aside, said, “I'm afraid you must be mistaken. I never cared for anyone named Freddie.” The tallest in the class, and thin, telling the other unpopular girls at recess: “My father doesn't like me to go out with boys. You know, the things they do.” And finally, after school, staying by the pretty young teacher, saying, “Don't you like Mary Roberts Rinehart, Miss Henwood? I think she's a terribly good author.”

The girls in school had called Catharine “Catty,” the teachers and her mother and father had called her “Catharine,” the girls in her office called her “Katy” or “Kitty,” but Aaron had called her “Cara,” “Strange Cara,” the one note from him began. Catharine had held it in her hands, sitting by an open window at night and looking at the stars, in Buffalo, with her father moving around suspiciously downstairs; in New York, with her mother dead.

“Ratty Catty, sure is batty.” Catharine remembered the jingle from the schoolyard and the notes passed from desk to desk, remembered it and turned it over in her mind while she leaned back with her feet on her dead mother's trunk and felt the soft upholstered chair against her shoulders, saw the traffic moving in the street below her apartment window, knew her job and her paycheck were waiting for her the next day. “Ratty Catty, sure is batty.” Catharine smiled comfortably. There had been a kissing game at one of the few parties she went to, a grammar-school graduation party, and Catharine, in the background, had unexpectedly had to come forward to kiss a boy (what boy? she wondered now. Freddie again?). And the boy, moving backward, saying, “Hey, listen,” while Catharine stood uncertainly. Then someone had shouted, “Catty's father won't let her kiss a boy,” and Catharine, trying to protect her father, had begun a denial before she realized that it was infinitely worse to admit that the boy had turned away from her. Then she told people, the other unpopular girls during recess, “My father won't let me go to the parties where they play that kind of game,” or, “If my father ever caught me doing what those other girls do!”

She went to business school, because her father needed someone to help him with his numerous notes and the books of sermons he might write someday, and held the idea of a secretary in his mind as a signal of success. At business school she was no stranger; the pretty girls had all gone on to college, and Catharine was with the other thin dull girls or fat girls who were vivacious and had crushes on the men instructors. The boys in the school were mostly earnest and hard-working, and stopped in the halls to ask Catharine what she thought of the typing test, and whether she had taken down today's assignment. Aaron came to the school in mid-semester, wearing a yellow sweater suddenly into the typing class, standing thin and small and graceful and smiling while the rows of students sat mutely at their typewriters watching him.

“I fell in love with you right away,” Catharine told him afterward. “I never knew what hit me.”

Once Catharine had asked her mother impulsively and injudiciously, “Mother, did you fall in love with my father?”

“Catharine,” her mother said, letting her hands stand quiet in the dishwater, “is there anything wrong, dear?”

High school had been worse for Catharine than any other time in her life. When the other girls wore sweaters or deer jackets and collected autographs, Catharine sat awkwardly under a badly designed wool dress. Once, with money her father borrowed from his brother, her mother bought Catharine a dark-green sweater and skirt, and when Catharine came into school that morning, one girl said, “What'd you do, rob a fire sale?” and another said, “Look at Catty, in the sweater she knit herself.” Years later, Catharine told Aaron, leaning forward with her elbows on the table and her cigarette smoke blowing into her eyes, “I don't like clothes, at all. I think everyone makes too much fuss over them. I think the human body is too fine.” When the girls with high-heeled shoes and curly hair went to sophomore proms and senior balls, Catharine and her three or four friends gave little hen parties where they served one another cocoa and cake, and said, “You'd be cute, honestly, Catty, if you had a permanent and wore some make-up.” And Catharine, blushing, “My father would kill me.” “You've got nice skin, though. Mine's always breaking out.” “No, it isn't,” Catharine said, or, “You're not fat, really. I only wish I looked like you, honestly.”

A terrible thing happened to Catharine in her junior year in high school. One of her friends was to usher in a show put on by the local chapter of the American Legion. It was a performance of The Mikado and daughters of some of the members were going to usher, in evening gowns, with a chance to help with the make-up. Edna was the name of Catharine's friend, and the third and last night of the performance Edna managed to get Catharine invited to usher in place of another girl who was sick. At seven o'clock Catharine, in a blue crepe dress of her mother's which fitted badly and was cruelly improvised over the shoulders with a white organdy frill, met Edna in the lobby of the auditorium; Mrs. Vincent, who had come over on the streetcar with Catharine, said to Edna, “You'll be sure and see that Catharine gets home all right?”

“My mother and father are going to drive her home,” Edna said. Mrs. Vincent kissed Catharine good-by, gave one sweeping suspicious glance over the auditorium, and went out to take the streetcar home. “How do I look?” Edna asked. “Look at me.” She held out her skirt and Catharine, horrified, realized that Edna, with her bad complexion and straight hair, looked lovely. “I got a finger wave,” Edna said, “and I'm wearing lipstick.” Catharine realized even then that once or twice in any girl's life there will be an evening when she looks beautiful; she was not used enough to being ugly to be content to wait until an hour or two of beauty could do her real service. “You look wonderful,” Catharine said sickly, “how do I look?” She held her coat open and Edna said, “You look beautiful, listen, we're going to the party for the cast after.”

Catharine stayed long enough after the performance to see Edna, with her finger wave uncurling damply and her wide skirts trailing after her, dancing dreamily in the arms of a stout middle-aged man who had been in the chorus; he giggled when he whispered in Edna's ear, and Edna rolled her eyes and slapped his face lightly, while her mother and father, tired and proud, sat at the side of the room and greeted casual acquaintances eagerly.

Catharine walked home, all the way, holding up the blue crepe skirt and not afraid that anyone would notice her. “It's the ugliest thing I ever saw,” she was whispering to herself. “Daddy will be furious.” Then, only a block from her home, she thought she was a beautiful glorious creature, walking in a garden, her long skirts moving softly over the ground, graceful, with people thronging around her for her autograph. “Please,” she said softly, waving a fan, “please don't say I'm beautiful... I'm not really, you know,” and a chorus of protests drowned out her voice, and she yielded, laughing softly.

Her father forbade her to speak to Edna again, and wrote Edna's father a sharp note, which was ignored. Her mother had to have the blue dress cleaned, because of the dirt on the hem.

“I don't think the ordinary run of person is able to recognize beauty when they see it,” Catharine told Aaron later, years later. “I think that your common person tramples on beauty because it is so far above him.”




“You always were an ungrateful, spoiled child,” her mother said, moving uneasily on the bed.

“You're living off me, aren't you?” Catharine answered indifferently. “You eat, don't you? Doesn't the doctor come twice a week to see you?”

“You never had a spark of affection in you,” her mother said.

“Something must make me take care of you and feed you,” Catharine said.

Her mother pulled at the blankets, her hands thin and powerless. “I don't know what I did to deserve a daughter like you.”

“You must have taken the Lord's name in vain,” Catharine said. She was standing leaning against the doorway to the kitchenette, waiting for her mother's oatmeal to cook. She had had a long and dismal day at the office, it was getting on toward winter (the winter when she could have had a cheap fur coat if her mother had not come) and her mother showed no signs of getting better or worse. She was almost completely careless of everything except that she was twenty-three years old, and still tied down; the romance and glory of her life waiting still.

“If your poor father could hear that.”

“My poor father can't hear anything,” Catharine said, “and I'm happy about it.”

Her mother tried to rise on the bed, tried to soften Catharine with tears in her eyes. “He was a good father to you, Catharine. You shouldn't say evil things like that.”

Catharine laughed and went into the kitchenette.

When Catharine was twelve her mother tried to give her a party. She bought little invitation cards at the five and ten, and paper hats and small baskets to hold candies. She bought ice cream and made a cake, and bought a game of pin-the-tail-onthe donkey. “The whole thing didn't cost but about three dollars,” she told Catharine's father. “I took most of the money out of my house money this week.”

“There's no reason why Catharine should have expensive entertainments,” her father said, frowning. “Her position as my daughter explains the absence of worldly frivolity in her life.”

“The child has never had a party before,” her mother said firmly.

“I don't want a party,” Catharine told herself, alone upstairs in her room, lying on the bed. “I don't want any of the kids to come here.” Her mother sent out the little invitations (Catharine Vincent, Thursday, August 24th, 2-5), and almost all of the twelve children invited had come.

The party was a miserable failure. Catharine, in an old dress with new collar and cuffs, and her mother in the dress she wore to church, greeted the guests at the door and sat them down in the living room where the little baskets of candy sat around on tables. The guests took the candy one piece at a time, played pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey as long as Mrs. Vincent wanted them to, and then sat quietly until one of them thought to say she ought to be getting home now. “But you haven't had your ice cream,” Catharine's mother cried with bright gaiety, “you can't leave before the ice cream.” Catharine's memories of that party were of her mother, working furiously, laughing and humming when she walked from place to place, her old dress showing constantly among the party dresses of the children; her mother saying “Well, don't you look pretty!” and “You must be the smartest little girl in Catharine's class.”

Afterward, at the dinner table, her mother said encouragingly, “Did you enjoy your party, dear?”

“I told you they'd act like that,” Catharine said without emotion. “They don't like me.”

“Catharine has no business wanting parties if her friends don't know how to behave to her mother,” Mr. Vincent said, devoting himself to a platter of liver and bacon. “You've worn yourself out and spent a lot of money to let the child have something she didn't need to have.”

“Remember the party you gave for me?” Catharine said to her mother lying on the bed. “Remember that terrible party you insisted on having?”

“You are an ungrateful daughter,” her mother said, moving under the blankets. “You always were a cold thoughtless child.”

One day when Catharine was about fourteen her mother came into the bedroom where Catharine was cleaning her dresser drawers. Sitting on the bed, her mother said to Catharine's back, “Your father wants me to talk to you, Catharine.”

Catharine, frozen, went on piling handkerchiefs and folding scarves. “What does he want you to talk to me about?”

“He thinks it's time I spoke to you,” her mother said unhappily.

All the time her mother talked, apologizing and fumbling, Catharine sat on the floor folding and unfolding a scarf. “Have the girls at school been talking about things like this?” her mother asked once.

“All the time,” Catharine said.

“You mustn't listen,” her mother said earnestly. “Your father and I are equipped to tell you the truth, the girls at school don't know anything. Catharine, I want you to promise me never to talk to anyone but your mother and father about these things.”

“If I have any questions I'll ask Daddy,” Catharine said.

“Don't laugh at your mother and father,” her mother said.

Catharine turned around to look at her mother. “Are you all finished?” Her mother nodded. “Then please let's never talk about it again,” Catharine said. “I don't want to talk about it again, ever.”

“Neither do I,” her mother said angrily. “It's hard enough to tell you anything at all, young lady, without having to talk about delicate subjects.”

“You tell Daddy you told me,” Catharine said as her mother went out the door.

“Did you love my father?” Catharine asked her mother lying on the bed, “did you ever love my father, Mother?”

“You never loved him,” her mother said, moving against the pillow, “you were an ungrateful child.”

“When you married him did you think you were going to be happy?”

“He was a good husband,” her mother said, “he tried very hard to be a good father, but you only wanted to make trouble. All your life.”




Catharine sat on the edge of the seat; she was nineteen and her hands were neatly on the booth table, her books beside her, her eyes on the door. If only someone comes in, just this once, she was thinking, if only one of the girls could see me, just this once.

“You look très sérieuse,” Aaron said. “Coffee?”

“Yes, please,” Catharine said.

“Now listen,” Aaron said. “I ask you to come out for coffee with me because I think you're interesting to talk to. You can't just sit there and not say anything.” Catharine looked up and saw he was smiling. “Say something witty,” he said.

She got a minute to think when the waiter came over and Aaron ordered the coffee, but when the waiter was gone and Aaron turned politely to her, she could only shake her head and smile.

“Let me start a conversation, then,” Aaron said. “What was the book you were carrying yesterday?”

“Did you see me?” Catharine asked before she thought.

“Certainly I saw you,” Aaron said. “I see you every day. Sometimes you wear a green sweater.”

Catharine felt that this had to be said quickly, urgently, before the moment got away from her. “I don't like clothes at all,” she said. “I think everyone makes too much fuss over them. I think the human body is too fine.”

Aaron stared. “Well!” he said.

Catharine thought back on what she had said and blushed. “I didn't mean to sound so vulgar,” she said.

Another time, when Catharine knew how to answer more easily, Aaron asked her, “Why don't we go to the five and ten and buy you a lipstick?”

“My father would kill me,” Catharine said.

“You could just wear it in school,” Aaron said. “I want my girl to be pretty.”

Catharine carried that “my girl” around with her in her mind ever afterward; she bought a lipstick and powder and rouge and nail polish, and put them on inexpertly in the girl's lavatory every morning before classes, and took them off each afternoon after leaving Aaron. Her father never knew; she kept them in a box in her pocketbook, and had a story prepared (“Gerry's family doesn't like her to wear make-up either, but she does anyway, and she asked me if I'd just keep these things—”).

Aaron liked to sit with a cigarette hanging out of the corner of his mouth; he kept his eyes narrow when he talked, and the smoke from the cigarette went past his eyebrow. He smiled more than anyone Catharine had ever known, and she thought once that he looked satanic; she told him so and he smiled at her, smoke in his eyes.

“The devil is the only true god,” he said.

Once her father frightened Catharine badly by saying to her abruptly at the dinner table “You're not running around with a young man, are you, Catharine?”

“Catharine?” her mother said.

“I was speaking to Mr. Blake this afternoon about a matter of business,” her father said ponderously, “and he mentioned that he had seen Catharine walking out of her business school with a young man. No one he knew.”

“It was probably one of the instructors,” Catharine said in a clear voice. “I was probably asking about an assignment.”

“I would not like to think that my daughter is associating with young men she is ashamed to introduce to her parents,” her father said.

“Mother and Daddy have a great deal of faith in you,” her mother said.

“It was probably Mr. Harley, our typing instructor,” Catharine said. “I had to ask him about an assignment and we walked down the hall talking and out the door. I did the wrong assignment and had to find out what to make up.”

“You should have told him to go to hell,” Aaron said later when Catharine told him.

“Someday I will,” Catharine said.

“Yes, Daddy dear,” Aaron said in a high voice, “I am associating with a young man I am definitely ashamed to introduce to you, because he is a thief and a murderer. And he rapes young women. Even Mother wouldn't be safe with him.”

Catharine shook her head helplessly. “He'd die,” she said. “He'd just die.”

When Aaron met Mr. and Mrs. Vincent he was very agreeable and Catharine was able to feel for a few minutes as though everything were going to pass off well. Aaron had escorted her home from school very properly and she had very properly invited him in. Her mother and father, sitting in the living room, watched Aaron and Catharine come in, and when Catharine said, “Mother and Daddy, this is Aaron, a friend of mine from school,” her father came over and took Aaron's hand. “Pleased to meet you, my boy,” he said.

“How do you do.” Aaron stood next to Catharine, comfortable in his yellow sweater.

“Aaron is in school too,” Catharine said to her mother.

“How do you like the school?” Catharine's mother said.

Conversation had continued without silences, they were sitting down, and Catharine met Aaron's eye and he smiled. She smiled back, and then realized that her mother and father were silently waiting. Aaron said smoothly, “Look at Cara's hands, Mrs. Vincent. They're like white waves on a white shore. They touch her face like white moths.”

Catharine met her father at the dinner table that night, with a sort of sick resignation that left her unsurprised when he said immediately, “I don't know about that young man.” He thought heavily. “Your mother and I have been talking about him.”

“It seems like your friends ought to be finer, somehow,” her mother said earnestly. “With your background.”

“He doesn't seem quite right, to me,” her father said. “Not quite right.”

“We'll find some money somehow,” her mother said, “and see if we can get you another dress. Sensible, but pretty enough to wear to parties.”

Sitting by the window with her mother's trunk open on the floor and her old report card (“English, B-, History, D, Geography, D”) in her hand, Catharine, to spite her mother, thought about Aaron. Because the dull eyes of William Vincent and his wife were no longer on her, because she was loose, at least, from their questions (“Catharine, have you been seeing—”) and their sudden quiet when she opened the front door, Catharine went to the little cedar box where she kept all her most secret treasures, and always had, and took out Aaron's only letter. In the box were a bright cotton handkerchief, and a tarnished silver charm bracelet. In her years in New York she had collected a match folder from a night club, and a printed note which read “We thank you for submitting the enclosed material and regret that we cannot make use of it.” It had come attached to some watercolor impressions Catharine had sent to a magazine; she kept it because of the word “regret” and because it had been addressed to her name and addressed by someone there at the magazine, some bright golden creature who called writers by their first names and sat at chromium bars and walked different streets than Catharine did, from her apartment on West Twentieth Street to her typist's job on Wall Street. And at the chromium bars Aaron was sitting, and he walked quickly past the bright stores, and he might be in any taxi passing, smiling at someone with his quick sudden amusement saying, “Catharine? I once cared for a girl named Catharine…”





The Beautiful Stranger


What might be called the first intimation of strangeness occurred at the railroad station. She had come with her children, Smalljohn and her baby girl, to meet her husband when he returned from a business trip to Boston. Because she had been oddly afraid of being late, and perhaps even seeming uneager to encounter her husband after a week's separation, she dressed the children and put them into the car at home a long half hour before the train was due. As a result, of course, they had to wait interminably at the station, and what was to have been a charmingly staged reunion, family embracing husband and father, became at last an ill-timed and awkward performance. Smalljohn's hair was mussed, and he was sticky. The baby was cross, pulling at her pink bonnet and her dainty laceedged dress, whining. The final arrival of the train caught them in mid-movement, as it were; Margaret was tying the ribbons on the baby's bonnet, Smalljohn was half over the back of the car seat. They scrambled out of the car, cringing from the sound of the train, hopelessly out of sorts.

John Senior waved from the high steps of the train. Unlike his wife and children, he looked utterly prepared for his return, as though he had taken some pains to secure a meeting at least painless, and had, in fact, stood just so, waving cordially from the steps of the train, for perhaps as long as half an hour, ensuring that he should not be caught half-ready, his hand not lifted so far as to overemphasize the extent of his delight in seeing them again.

His wife had an odd sense of lost time. Standing now on the platform with the baby in her arms and Smalljohn beside her, she could not for a minute remember clearly whether he was coming home, or, whether they were yet standing here to say good-by to him. They had been quarreling when he left, and she had spent the week of his absence determining to forget that in his presence she had been frightened and hurt. This will be a good time to get things straight, she had been telling herself; while John is gone I can try to get hold of myself again. Now, unsure at last whether this was an arrival or a departure, she felt afraid again, straining to meet an unendurable tension. This will not do, she thought, believing that she was being honest with herself, and as he came down the train steps and walked toward them she smiled, holding the baby tightly against her so that the touch of its small warmth might bring some genuine tenderness into her smile.

This will not do, she thought, and smiled more cordially and told him “hello” as he came to her. Wondering, she kissed him and then when he held his arm around her and the baby for a minute the baby pulled back and struggled, screaming. Everyone moved in anger, and the baby kicked and screamed, “No, no, no.”

“What a way to say hello to Daddy,” Margaret said, and she shook the baby, half-amused, and yet grateful for the baby's sympathetic support. John turned to Smalljohn and lifted him, Smalljohn kicking and laughing helplessly. “Daddy, Daddy,” Smalljohn shouted, and the baby screamed, “No, no.”

Helplessly, because no one could talk with the baby screaming so, they turned and went to the car. When the baby was back in her pink basket in the car, and Smalljohn was settled with another lollipop beside her, there was an appalling quiet which would have to be filled as quickly as possible with meaningful words. John had taken the driver's seat in the car while Margaret was quieting the baby, and when Margaret got in beside him she felt a little chill of animosity at the sight of his hands on the wheel; I can't bear to relinquish even this much, she thought; for a week no one has driven the car except me. Because she could see so clearly that this was unreasonable—John owned half the car, after all—she said to him with bright interest, “And how was your trip? The weather?”

“Wonderful,” he said, and again she was angered at the warmth in his tone; if she was unreasonable about the car, he was surely unreasonable to have enjoyed himself quite so much. “Everything went very well. I'm pretty sure I got the contract, everyone was very pleasant about it, and I go back in two weeks to settle everything.”

The stinger is in the tail, she thought. He wouldn't tell it all so hastily if he didn't want me to miss half of it; I am supposed to be pleased that he got the contract and that everyone was so pleasant, and the part about going back is supposed to slip past me painlessly.

“Maybe I can go with you, then,” she said. “Your mother will take the children.”

“Fine,” he said, but it was much too late; he had hesitated noticeably before he spoke.

“I want to go too,” said Smalljohn. “Can I go with Daddy?”

They came into their house, Margaret carrying the baby, and John carrying his suitcase and arguing delightedly with Smalljohn over which of them was carrying the heavier weight of it. The house was ready for them; Margaret had made sure that it was cleaned and emptied of the qualities which attached so surely to her position of wife alone with small children; the toys which Smalljohn had thrown around with unusual freedom were picked up, the baby's clothes (no one, after all, came to call when John was gone) were taken from the kitchen radiator where they had been drying. Aside from the fact that the house gave no impression of waiting for any particular people, but only for anyone well-bred and clean enough to fit within its small trim walls, it could have passed for a home, Margaret thought, even for a home where a happy family lived in domestic peace. She set the baby down in the playpen and turned with the baby's bonnet and jacket in her hand and saw her husband, head bent gravely as he listened to Smalljohn. Who? she wondered suddenly; is he taller? That is not my husband.

She laughed, and they turned to her, Smalljohn curious, and her husband with a quick bright recognition; she thought, why, it is not my husband, and he knows that I have seen it. There was no astonishment in her; she would have thought perhaps thirty seconds before that such a thing was impossible, but since it was now clearly possible, surprise would have been meaningless. Some other emotion was necessary, but she found at first only peripheral manifestations of one. Her heart was beating violently, her hands were shaking, and her fingers were cold. Her legs felt weak and she took hold of the back of a chair to steady herself. She found that she was still laughing, and then her emotion caught up with her and she knew what it was: it was relief.

“I'm glad you came,” she said. She went over and put her head against his shoulder. “It was hard to say hello in the station,” she said.

Smalljohn looked on for a minute and then wandered off to his toybox. Margaret was thinking, this is not the man who enjoyed seeing me cry; I need not be afraid. She caught her breath and was quiet; there was nothing that needed saying.

For the rest of the day she was happy. There was a constant delight in the relief from her weight of fear and unhappiness, it was pure joy to know that there was no longer any residue of suspicion and hatred; when she called him “John” she did so demurely, knowing that he participated in her secret amusement; when he answered her civilly there was, she thought, an edge of laughter behind his words. They seemed to have agreed soberly that mention of the subject would be in bad taste, might even, in fact, endanger their pleasure.

They were hilarious at dinner. John would not have made her a cocktail, but when she came downstairs from putting the children to bed the stranger met her at the foot of the stairs, smiling up at her, and took her arm to lead her into the living room where the cocktail shaker and glasses stood on the low table before the fire.

“How nice,” she said, happy that she had taken a moment to brush her hair and put on fresh lipstick, happy that the coffee table which she had chosen with John and the fireplace which had seen many fires built by John and the low sofa where John had slept sometimes, had all seen fit to welcome the stranger with grace. She sat on the sofa and smiled at him when he handed her a glass; there was an odd illicit excitement in all of it; she was “entertaining” a man. The scene was a little marred by the fact that he had given her a martini with neither olive nor onion; it was the way she preferred her martini, and yet he should not have, strictly, known this, but she reassured herself with the thought that naturally he would have taken some pains to inform himself before coming.

He lifted his glass to her with a smile; he is here only because I am here, she thought.

“It's nice to be here,” he said. He had, then, made one attempt to sound like John, in the car coming home. After he knew that she had recognized him for a stranger, he had never made any attempt to say words like “coming home” or “getting back,” and of course she could not, not without pointing her lie. She put her hand in his and lay back against the sofa, looking into the fire.

“Being lonely is worse than anything in the world,” she said.

“You're not lonely now?”

“Are you going away?”

“Not unless you come too.” They laughed at his parody of John.

They sat next to each other at dinner; she and John had always sat at formal opposite ends of the table, asking one another politely to pass the salt and the butter.

“I'm going to put in a little set of shelves over there,” he said, nodding toward the corner of the dining room. “It looks empty here, and it needs things. Symbols.”

“Like?” She liked to look at him; his hair, she thought, was a little darker than John's, and his hands were stronger; this man would build whatever he decided he wanted built.

“We need things together. Things we like, both of us. Small delicate pretty things. Ivory.”

With John she would have felt it necessary to remark at once that they could not afford such delicate pretty things, and put a cold finish to the idea, but with the stranger she said, “We'd have to look for them; not everything would be right.”

“I saw a little creature once,” he said. “Like a tiny little man, only colored all purple and blue and gold.”




She remembered this conversation; it contained the truth like a jewel set in the evening. Much later, she was to tell herself that it was true; John could not have said these things.




She was happy, she was radiant, she had no conscience. He went obediently to his office the next morning, saying good-by at the door with a rueful smile that seemed to mock the present necessity for doing the things that John always did, and as she watched him go down the walk she reflected that this was surely not going to be permanent; she could not endure having him gone for so long every day, although she had felt little about parting from John; moreover, if he kept doing John's things he might grow imperceptibly more like John. We will simply have to go away, she thought. She was pleased, seeing him get into the car; she would gladly share with him—indeed, give him outright—all that had been John's, so long as he stayed her stranger.

She laughed while she did her housework and dressed the baby. She took satisfaction in unpacking his suitcase, which he had abandoned and forgotten in a corner of the bedroom, as though prepared to take it up and leave again if she had not been as he thought her, had not wanted him to stay. She put away his clothes, so disarmingly like John's and wondered for a minute at the closet; would there be a kind of delicacy in him about John's things? Then she told herself no, not so long as he began with John's wife, and laughed again.

The baby was cross all day, but when Smalljohn came home from nursery school his first question was—looking up eagerly—“Where is Daddy?”

“Daddy has gone to the office,” and again she laughed, at the moment's quick sly picture of the insult to John.




Half a dozen times during the day she went upstairs, to look at his suitcase and touch the leather softly. She glanced constantly as she passed through the dining room into the corner where the small shelves would be someday, and told herself that they would find a tiny little man, all purple and blue and gold, to stand on the shelves and guard them from intrusion.

When the children awakened from their naps she took them for a walk and then, away from the house and returned violently to her former lonely pattern (walk with the children, talk meaninglessly of Daddy, long for someone to talk to in the evening ahead, restrain herself from hurrying home: he might have telephoned), she began to feel frightened again; suppose she had been wrong? It could not be possible that she was mistaken; it would be unutterably cruel for John to come home tonight.

Then, she heard the car stop and when she opened the door and looked up she thought, no, it is not my husband, with a return of gladness. She was aware from his smile that he had perceived her doubts, and yet he was so clearly a stranger that, seeing him, she had no need of speaking.

She asked him, instead, almost meaningless questions during that evening, and his answers were important only because she was storing them away to reassure herself while he was away. She asked him what was the name of their Shakespeare professor in college, and who was that girl he liked so before he met Margaret. When he smiled and said that he had no idea, that he would not recognize the name if she told him, she was in delight. He had not bothered to master all of the past, then; he had learned enough (the names of the children, the location of the house, how she liked her cocktails) to get to her, and after that, it was not important, because either she would want him to stay, or she would, calling upon John, send him away again.

“What is your favorite food?” she asked him. “Are you fond of fishing? Did you ever have a dog?”

“Someone told me today,” he said once, “that he had heard I was back from Boston, and I distinctly thought he said that he heard I was dead in Boston.”

He was lonely, too, she thought with sadness, and that is why he came, bringing a destiny with him: now I will see him come every evening through the door and think, this is not my husband, and wait for him remembering that I am waiting for a stranger.

At any rate she said, “you were not dead in Boston, and nothing else matters.”

She saw him leave in the morning with a warm pride, and she did her housework and dressed the baby; when Smalljohn came home from nursery school he did not ask, but looked with quick searching eyes and then sighed. While the children were taking their naps she thought that she might take them to the park this afternoon, and then the thought of another such afternoon, another long afternoon with no one but the children, another afternoon of widowhood, was more than she could submit to; I have done this too much, she thought, I must see something today beyond the faces of my children. No one should be so much alone.

Moving quickly, she dressed and set the house to rights. She called a high-school girl and asked if she would take the children to the park; without guilt, she neglected the thousand small orders regarding the proper jacket for the baby, whether Smalljohn might have popcorn, when to bring them home. She fled, thinking, I must be with people.

She took a taxi into town, because it seemed to her that the only possible thing to do was to seek out a gift for him, her first gift to him, and she thought she would find him, perhaps, a little creature all blue and purple and gold.

She wandered through the strange shops in the town, choosing small lovely things to stand on the new shelves, looking long and critically at ivories, at small statues, at brightly colored meaningless expensive toys, suitable for giving to a stranger.

It was almost dark when she started home, carrying her packages. She looked from the window of the taxi into the dark streets, and thought with pleasure that the stranger would be home before her, and look from the window to see her hurrying to him; he would think, this is a stranger, I am waiting for a stranger, as he saw her coming. “Here,” she said, tapping on the glass, “right here, driver.” She got out of the taxi and paid the driver, and smiled as he drove away. I must look well, she thought, the driver smiled back at me.

She turned and started for the house, and then hesitated; surely she had come too far? This is not possible, she thought, this cannot be; surely our house was white?

The evening was very dark, and she could see only the houses going in rows, with more rows beyond them and more rows beyond that, and somewhere a house which was hers, with the beautiful stranger inside, and she lost out here.





The Daemon Lover


She had not slept well; from one-thirty, when Jamie left and she went lingeringly to bed, until seven, when she at last allowed herself to get up and make coffee, she had slept fitfully, stirring awake to open her eyes and look into the half-darkness, remembering over and over, slipping again into a feverish dream. She spent almost an hour over her coffee—they were to have a real breakfast on the way—and then, unless she wanted to dress early, had nothing to do. She washed her coffee cup and made the bed, looking carefully over the clothes she planned to wear, worried unnecessarily, at the window, over whether it would be a fine day. She sat down to read, thought that she might write a letter to her sister instead, and began, in her finest handwriting, “Dearest Anne, by the time you get this I will be married. Doesn't it sound funny? I can hardly believe it myself, but when I tell you how it happened, you'll see it's even stranger than that…”

Sitting, pen in hand, she hesitated over what to say next, read the lines already written, and tore up the letter. She went to the window and saw that it was undeniably a find day. It occurred to her that perhaps she ought not to wear the blue silk dress; it was too plain, almost severe, and she wanted to be soft, feminine. Anxiously she pulled through the dresses in the closet, and hesitated over a print she had worn the summer before; it was too young for her, and it had a ruffled neck, and it was very early in the year for a print dress, but still…

She hung the two dresses side by side on the outside of the closet door and opened the glass doors carefully closed upon the small closet that was her kitchenette. She turned on the burner under the coffeepot, and went to the window; it was sunny. When the coffeepot began to crackle she came back and poured herself coffee, into a clean cup. I'll have a headache if I don't get some solid food soon, she thought, all this coffee, smoking too much, no real breakfast. A headache on her wedding day; she went and got the tin box of aspirin from the bathroom closet and slipped it into her blue pocketbook. She'd have to change to a brown pocketbook if she wore the print dress, and the only brown pocketbook she had was shabby. Helplessly, she stood looking from the blue pocketbook to the print dress, and then put the pocketbook down and went and got her coffee and sat down near the window, drinking her coffee, and looked carefully around the one-room apartment. They planned to come back here tonight and everything must be correct. With sudden horror she realized that she had forgotten to put clean sheets on the bed; the laundry was freshly back and she took clean sheets and pillow cases from the top shelf of the closet and stripped the bed, working quickly to avoid thinking consciously of why she was changing the sheets. The bed was a studio bed, with a cover to make it look like a couch, and when it was finished no one would have known she had just put clean sheets on it. She took the old sheets and pillow cases into the bathroom and stuffed them down into the hamper, and put the bathroom towels in the hamper too, and clean towels on the bathroom racks. Her coffee was cold when she came back to it, but she drank it anyway.

When she looked at the clock, finally, and saw that it was after nine, she began at last to hurry. She took a bath, and used one of the clean towels, which she put into the hamper and replaced with a clean one. She dressed carefully, all her underwear fresh and most of it new; she put everything she had worn the day before, including her nightgown, into the hamper. When she was ready for her dress, she hesitated before the closet door. The blue dress was certainly decent, and clean, and fairly becoming, but she had worn it several times with Jamie, and there was nothing about it which made it special for a wedding day. The print dress was overly pretty, and new to Jamie, and yet wearing such a print this early in the year was certainly rushing the season. Finally she thought, This is my wedding day, I can dress as I please, and she took the print dress down from the hanger. When she slipped it on over her head it felt fresh and light, but when she looked at herself in the mirror she remembered that the ruffles around the neck did not show her throat to any great advantage, and the wide swinging skirt looked irresistibly made for a girl, for someone who would run freely, dance, swing it with her hips when she walked. Looking at herself in the mirror, she thought with revulsion, It's as though I was trying to make myself look prettier than I am, just for him; he'll think I want to look younger because he's marrying me; and she tore the print dress off so quickly that a seam under the arm ripped. In the old blue dress she felt comfortable and familiar, but unexciting. It isn't what you're wearing that matters, she told herself firmly, and turned in dismay to the closet to see if there might be anything else. There was nothing even remotely suitable for her marrying Jamie, and for a minute she thought of going out quickly to some little shop nearby, to get a dress. Then she saw that it was close on ten, and she had no time for more than her hair and her make-up. Her hair was easy, pulled back into a knot at the nape of her neck, but her make-up was another delicate balance between looking as well as possible, and deceiving as little. She could not try to disguise the sallowness of her skin, or the lines around her eyes, today, when it might look as though she were only doing it for her wedding, and yet she could not bear the thought of Jamie's bringing to marriage anyone who looked haggard and lined. You're thirty-four years old after all, she told herself cruelly in the bathroom mirror. Thirty, it said on the license.

It was two minutes after ten; she was not satisfied with her clothes, her face, her apartment. She heated the coffee again and sat down in the chair by the window. Can't do anything more now, she thought, no sense trying to improve anything the last minute.

Reconciled, settled, she tried to think of Jamie and could not see his face clearly, or hear his voice. It's always that way with someone you love, she thought, and let her mind slip past today and tomorrow, into the farther future, when Jamie was established with his writing and she had given up her job, the golden house-in-the-country future they had been preparing for the last week. “I used to be a wonderful cook,” she had promised Jamie, “with a little time and practice I could remember how to make angel-food cake. And fried chicken,” she said, knowing how the words would stay in Jamie's mind, half-tenderly. “And Hollandaise sauce.”

Ten-thirty. She stood up and went purposefully to the phone. She dialed, and waited, and the girl's metallic voice said, “…the time will be exactly ten-twenty-nine.” Half-consciously she set her clock back a minute; she was remembering her own voice saying last night, in the doorway: “Ten o'clock then. I'll be ready. Is it really true?”

And Jamie laughing down the hallway.

By eleven o'clock she had sewed up the ripped seam in the print dress and put her sewing-box away carefully in the closet. With the print dress on, she was sitting by the window drinking another cup of coffee. I could have taken more time over my dressing after all, she thought; but by now it was so late he might come any minute, and she did not dare try to repair anything without starting all over. There was nothing to eat in the apartment except the food she had carefully stocked up for their life beginning together: the unopened package of bacon, the dozen eggs in their box, the unopened bread and the unopened butter; they were for breakfast tomorrow. She thought of running downstairs to the drugstore for something to eat, leaving a note on the door. Then she decided to wait a little longer.

By eleven-thirty she was so dizzy and weak that she had to go downstairs. If Jamie had had a phone she would have called him then. Instead, she opened her desk and wrote a note: “Jamie, have gone downstairs to the drugstore. Back in five minutes.” Her pen leaked onto her fingers and she went into the bathroom and washed, using a clean towel which she replaced. She tacked the note on the door, surveyed the apartment once more to make sure that everything was perfect, and closed the door without locking it, in case he should come.

In the drugstore she found that there was nothing she wanted to eat except more coffee, and she left it half-finished because she suddenly realized that Jamie was probably upstairs waiting and impatient, anxious to get started.

But upstairs everything was prepared and quiet, as she had left it, her note unread on the door, the air in the apartment a little stale from too many cigarettes. She opened the window and sat down next to it until she realized that she had been asleep and it was twenty minutes to one.

Now, suddenly she was frightened. Waking without preparation into the room of waiting and readiness, everything clean and untouched since ten o'clock, she was frightened, and felt an urgent need to hurry. She got up from the chair and almost ran across the room to the bathroom, dashed cold water on her face, and used a clean towel; this time she put the towel carelessly back on the rack without changing it; time enough for that later. Hatless, still in the print dress with a coat thrown on over it, the wrong blue pocketbook with the aspirin inside in her hand, she locked the apartment door behind her, no note this time, and ran down the stairs. She caught a taxi on the corner and gave the driver Jamie's address.

It was no distance at all; she could have walked it if she had not been so weak, but in the taxi she suddenly realized how imprudent it would be to drive brazenly up to Jamie's door, demanding him. She asked the driver, therefore, to let her off at a corner near Jamie's address and, after paying him, waited till he drove away before she started to walk down the block. She had never been here before; the building was pleasant and old, and Jamie's name was not on any of the mailboxes in the vestibule, nor on the doorbells. She checked the address; it was right, and finally she rang the bell marked “Superintendent.” After a minute or two the door buzzer rang and she opened the door and went into the dark hall where she hesitated until a door at the end opened and someone said, “Yes?”

She knew at the same moment that she had no idea what to ask, so she moved forward toward the figure waiting against the light of the open doorway. When she was very near, the figure said, “Yes?” again and she saw that it was a man in his shirtsleeves, unable to see her any more clearly than she could see him.

With sudden courage she said, “I'm trying to get in touch with someone who lives in this building and I can't find the name outside.”

“What's the name you wanted?” the man asked, and she realized that she would have to answer.

“James Harris,” she said. “Harris.”

The man was silent for a minute and then he said, “Harris.” He turned around to the room inside the lighted doorway and said, “Margie, come here a minute.”

“What now?” a voice said from inside, and after a wait long enough for someone to get out of a comfortable chair a woman joined him in the doorway, regarding the dark hall. “Lady here,” the man said. “Lady looking for a guy name of Harris, lives here. Anyone in the building?”

“No,” the woman said. Her voice sounded amused. “No men named Harris here.”

“Sorry,” the man said. He started to close the door. “You got the wrong house, lady,” he said, and added in a lower voice, “or the wrong guy,” and he and the woman laughed.

When the door was almost shut and she was alone in the dark hall she said to the thin lighted crack still showing, “But he does live here; I know it.”

“Look,” the woman said, opening the door again a little, “it happens all the time.”

“Please don't make any mistake,” she said, and her voice was very dignified, with thirty-four years of accumulated pride. “I'm afraid you don't understand.”

“What did he look like?” the woman said wearily, the door still only part open.

“He's rather tall, and fair. He wears a blue suit very often. He's a writer.”

“No,” the woman said, and then, “Could he have lived on the third floor?”

“I'm not sure.”

“There was a fellow,” the woman said reflectively. “He wore a blue suit a lot, lived on the third floor for a while. The Roysters lent him their apartment while they were visiting her folks upstate.”

“That might be it; I thought, though…”

“This one wore a blue suit mostly, but I don't know how tall he was,” the woman said. “He stayed there about a month.”

“A month ago is when—”

“You ask the Roysters,” the woman said. “They come back this morning. Apartment 3B.”

The door closed, definitely. The hall was very dark and the stairs looked darker.

On the second floor, there was a little light from a skylight far above. The apartment doors lined up, four on the floor, uncommunicative and silent. There was a bottle of milk outside 2C.

On the third floor she waited for a minute. There was the sound of music beyond the door of 3B, and she could hear voices. Finally she knocked, and knocked again. The door was opened and the music swept out at her, an early afternoon symphony broadcast. “How do you do,” she said politely to the woman in the doorway. “Mrs. Royster?”

“That's right.” The woman was wearing a housecoat and last night's make-up.

“I wonder if I might talk to you for a minute?”

“Sure,” Mrs. Royster said, not moving.

“About Mr. Harris.”

“What Mr. Harris?” Mrs. Royster said flatly.

“Mr. James Harris. The gentleman who borrowed your apartment.”

“O Lord,” Mrs. Royster said. She seemed to open her eyes for the first time. “What'd he do?”

“Nothing. I'm just trying to get in touch with him.”

“O Lord,” Mrs. Royster said again. Then she opened the door wider and said, “Come in,” and then, “Ralph!”

Inside, the apartment was still full of music, and there were suitcases half-unpacked on the couch, on the chairs, on the floor, A table in the corner was spread with the remains of a meal, and the young man sitting there, for a moment resembling Jamie, got up and came across the room.

“What about it?” he said.

“Mr. Royster,” she said. It was difficult to talk against the music. “The superintendent downstairs told me that this was where Mr. James Harris has been living.”

“Sure,” he said. “If that was his name.”

“I thought you lent him the apartment,” she said, surprised.

“I don't know anything about him,” Mr. Royster said. “He's one of Dottie's friends.”

“Not my friends,” Mrs. Royster said. “No friend of mine.” She had gone over to the table and was spreading peanut butter on a piece of bread. She took a bite and said thickly, waving the bread and peanut butter at her husband. “Not my friend.”

“You picked him up at one of those damn meetings,” Mr. Royster said. He shoved a suitcase off the chair next to the radio and sat down, picking up a magazine from the floor next to him. “I never said more'n ten words to him.”

“You said it was okay to lend him the place,” Mrs. Royster said before she took another bite. “You never said a word against him, after all.”

“I don't say anything about your friends,” Mr. Royster said.

“If he'd of been a friend of mine you would have said plenty, believe me,” Mrs. Royster said darkly. She took another bite and said, “Believe me, he would have said plenty.”

“That's all I want to hear,” Mr. Royster said, over the top of the magazine. “No more now.”

“You see.” Mrs. Royster pointed the bread and peanut butter at her husband. “That's the way it is, day and night.”

There was silence except for the music bellowing out of the radio next to Mr. Royster, and then she said, in a voice she hardly trusted to be heard over the radio noise, “Has he gone, then?”

“Who?” Mrs. Royster demanded, looking up from the peanut butter jar.

“Mr. James Harris.”

“Him? He must've left this morning, before we got back. No sign of him anywhere.”

“Gone?”

“Everything was fine, though, perfectly fine. I told you,” she said to Mr. Royster, “I told you he'd take care of everything fine. I can always tell.”

“You were lucky,” Mr. Royster said.

“Not a thing out of place,” Mrs. Royster said. She waved her bread and peanut butter inclusively. “Everything just the way we left it,” she said.

“Do you know where he is now?”

“Not the slightest idea,” Mrs. Royster said cheerfully. “But, like I said, he left everything fine. Why?” she asked suddenly. “You looking for him?”

“It's very important.”

“I'm sorry he's not here,” Mrs. Royster said. She stepped forward politely when she saw her visitor turn toward the door.

“Maybe the super saw him,” Mr. Royster said into the magazine.

When the door was closed behind her the hall was dark again, but the sound of the radio was deadened. She was halfway down the first flight of stairs when the door was opened and Mrs. Royster shouted down the stairwell, “If I see him I'll tell him you were looking for him.”

What can I do? She thought, out on the street again. It was impossible to go home, not with Jamie somewhere between here and there. She stood on the sidewalk so long that a woman, leaning out of a window across the way, turned and called to someone inside to come and see. Finally, on an impulse, she went into the small delicatessen next door to the apartment house, on the side that led to her own apartment. There was a small man reading a newspaper, leaning against the counter; when she came in he looked up and came down inside the counter to meet her.

Over the glass case of cold meats and cheese she said, timidly, “I'm trying to get in touch with a man who lived in the apartment house next door, and I just wondered if you know him.”

“Whyn't you ask the people there?” The man said, his eyes narrow, inspecting her.

It's because I'm not buying anything, she thought, and she said, “I'm sorry. I asked them, but they don't know anything about him. They think he left this morning.”

“I don't know what you want me to do,” he said, moving a little back toward his newspaper. “I'm not here to keep track of guys going in and out next door.”

She said quickly, “I thought you might have noticed, that's all. He would have been coming past here, a little before ten o'clock. He was rather tall, and he usually wore a blue suit.”

“Now how many men in blue suits go past here every day, lady?” the man demanded. “You think I got nothing to do but—”

“I'm sorry,” she said. She heard him say, “For God's sake,” as she went out the door.

As she walked toward the corner, she thought, he must have come this way, it's the way he'd go to get to my house, it's the only way for him to walk. She tried to think of Jamie: where would he have crossed the street? What sort of person was he actually—would he cross in front of his own apartment house, at random in the middle of the block, at the corner?

On the corner was a newsstand; they might have seen him there. She hurried on and waited while a man bought a paper and a woman asked directions. When the newsstand man looked at her she said, “Can you possibly tell me if a rather tall young man in a blue suit went past here this morning around ten o'clock?” When the man only looked at her, his eyes wide and his mouth a little open, she thought, he thinks it's a joke, or a trick, and she said urgently, “It's very important, please believe me. I'm not teasing you.”

“Look, lady,” the man began, and she said eagerly, “He's a writer. He might have bought magazines here.”

“What you want him for?” the man asked. He looked at her, smiling, and she realized that there was another man waiting in back of her and the newsdealer's smile included him. “Never mind,” she said, but the newsdealer said, “Listen, maybe he did come by here.” His smile was knowing and his eyes shifted over her shoulder to the man in back of her. She was suddenly horribly aware of her over-young print dress, and pulled her coat around her quickly. The newsdealer said, with vast thoughtfulness, “Now I don't know for sure, mind you, but there might have been someone like your gentleman friend coming by this morning.”

“About ten?”

“About ten,” the newsdealer agreed. “Tall fellow, blue suit. I wouldn't be at all surprised.”

“Which way did he go?” she said eagerly. “Uptown?”

“Uptown,” the newsdealer said, nodding. “He went uptown. That's just exactly it. What can I do for you, sir?”

She stepped back, holding her coat around her. The man who had been standing behind her looked at her over his shoulder and then he and the newsdealer looked at one another. She wondered for a minute whether or not to tip the newsdealer but when both men began to laugh she moved hurriedly on across the street.

Uptown, she thought, that's right, and she started up the avenue, thinking: He wouldn't have to cross the avenue, just go up six blocks and turn down my street, so long as he started uptown. About a block farther on she passed a florist's shop; there was a wedding display in the window and she thought, This is my wedding day after all, he might have gotten flowers to bring me, and she went inside. The florist came out of the back of the shop, smiling and sleek, and she said, before he could speak, so that he wouldn't have a chance to think she was buying anything: “It's terribly important that I get in touch with a gentleman who may have stopped in here to buy flowers this morning. Terribly important.”

She stopped for breath, and the florist said, “Yes, what sort of flowers were they?”

“I don't know,” she said, surprised. “He never—” She stopped and said, “He was a rather tall young man, in a blue suit. It was about ten o'clock.”

“I see,” the florist said. “Well, really, I'm afraid…”

“But it's so important,” she said. “He may have been in a hurry,” she added helpfully.

“Well,” the florist said. He smiled genially, showing all his small teeth. “For a lady,” he said. He went to a stand and opened a large book. “Where were they to be sent?” he asked.

“Why,” she said, “I don't think he'd have sent them. You see, he was coming—that is, he'd bring them.”

“Madam,” the florist said; he was offended. His smile became deprecatory, and he went on, “Really, you must realize that unless I have something to go on…”

“Please try to remember,” she begged. “He was tall, and had a blue suit, and it was about ten this morning.”

The florist closed his eyes, one finger to his mouth, and thought deeply. Then he shook his head. “I simply can't,” he said.

“Thank you,” she said despondently, and started for the door, when the florist said, in a shrill, excited voice, “Wait! Wait just a moment, madam.” She turned and the florist, thinking again, said finally, “Chrysanthemums?” He looked at her inquiringly.

“Oh, no,” she said; her voice shook a little and she waited for a minute before she went on. “Not for an occasion like this, I'm sure.”

The florist tightened his lips and looked away coldly. “Well, of course I don't know the occasion,” he said, “but I'm almost certain that the gentleman you were inquiring for came in this morning and purchased one dozen chrysanthemums. No delivery.”

“You're sure?” she asked.

“Positive,” the florist said emphatically. “That was absolutely the man.” He smiled brilliantly, and she smiled back and said, “Well, thank you very much.”

He escorted her to the door. “Nice corsage?” he said, as said as they went through the shop. “Red roses? Gardenias?”

“It was very kind of you to help me,” she said at the door.

“Ladies always look their best in flowers,” he said, bending his head toward her. “Orchids, perhaps?”

“No, thank you,” she said, and he said, “I hope you find your young man,” and gave it a nasty sound.

Going on up the street she thought, Everyone thinks it's so funny: and she pulled her coat tighter around her, so that only the ruffle around the bottom of the print dress was showing.

There was a policeman on the corner, and she thought, Why don't I go to the police—you go to the police for a missing person. And then thought, What a fool I'd look like. She had a quick picture of herself standing in a police station, saying, “Yes, we were going to be married today, but he didn't come,” and the policemen, three or four of them standing around listening, looking at her, at the print dress, at her too-bright make-up, smiling at one another. She couldn't tell them any more than that, could not say, “Yes, it looks silly, doesn't it, me all dressed up and trying to find the young man who promised to marry me, but what about all of it you don't know? I have more than this, more than you see: talent, perhaps, and humor of a sort, and I'm a lady and I have pride and affection and delicacy and a certain clear view of life that might make a man satisfied and productive and happy; there's more than you think when you look at me.”

The police were obviously impossible, leaving out Jamie and what he might think when he heard she'd set the police after him. “No, no,” she said aloud, hurrying her steps, and someone passing stopped and looked after her.

On the coming corner—she was three blocks from her own street—was a shoeshine stand, an old man sitting almost asleep in one of the chairs. She stopped in front of him and waited, and after a minute he opened his eyes and smiled at her.

“Look,” she said, the words coming before the thought of them, “I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm looking for a young man who came up this way about ten this morning, did you see him?” And she began her description, “Tall, blue suit, carrying a bunch of flowers?”

The old man began to nod before she was finished. “I saw him,” he said. “Friend of yours?”

“Yes,” she said, and smiled back involuntarily.

The old man blinked his eyes and said, “I remember I thought, You're going to see your girl, young fellow. They all go to see their girls,” he said, and shook his head tolerantly.

“Which way did he go? Straight on up the avenue?”

“That's right,” the old man said. “Got a shine, had his flowers, all dressed up, in an awful hurry. You got a girl, I thought.”

“Thank you,” she said, fumbling in her pocket for her loose change.

“She sure must of been glad to see him, the way he looked,” the old man said.

“Thank you,” she said again, and brought her hand empty from her pocket.

For the first time she was really sure he would be waiting for her, and she hurried up the three blocks, the skirt of the print dress swinging under her coat, and turned into her own block. From the corner she could not see her own windows, could not see Jamie looking out, waiting for her, and going down the block she was almost running to get to him. Her key trembled in her fingers at the downstairs door, and as she glanced into the drugstore she thought of her panic, drinking coffee there this morning, and almost laughed. At her own door she could wait no longer, but began to say, “Jamie, I'm here, I was so worried,” even before the door was open.

Her own apartment was waiting for her, silent, barren, afternoon shadows lengthening from the window. For a minute she saw only the empty coffee cup, thought, He has been here waiting, before she recognized it as her own, left from the morning. She looked all over the room, into the closet, into the bathroom.

“I never saw him,” the clerk in the drugstore said. “I know because I would of noticed the flowers. No one like that's been in.”

The old man at the shoeshine stand woke up again to see her standing in front of him. “Hello again,” he said, and smiled.

“Are you sure?” she demanded. “Did he go on up the avenue?”

“I watched him,” the old man said, dignified against her tone. “I thought, There's a young man's got a girl, and I watched him right into the house.”

“What house?” she said remotely.

“Right there,” the old man said. He leaned forward to point. “The next block. With his flowers and his shine and going to see his girl. Right into her house.”

“Which one?” she said.

“About the middle of the block,” the old man said. He looked at her with suspicion, and said, “What you trying to do, anyway?”

She almost ran, without stopping to say “Thank you.” Up on the next block she walked quickly, searching the houses from the outside to see if Jamie looked from a window, listening to hear his laughter somewhere inside.

A woman was sitting in front of one of the houses, pushing a baby carriage monotonously back and forth the length of her arm. The baby inside slept, moving back and forth.

The question was fluent, by now. “I'm sorry, but did you see a young man go into one of these houses about ten this morning? He was tall, wearing a blue suit, carrying a bunch of flowers.”

A boy about twelve stopped to listen, turning intently from one to the other, occasionally glancing at the baby.

“Listen,” the woman said tiredly, “the kid has his bath at ten. Would I see strange men walking around? I ask you?”

“Big bunch of flowers?” the boy asked, pulling at her coat. “Big bunch of flowers? I see him, missus.”

She looked down and the boy grinned insolently at her. “Which house did he go in?” she asked wearily.

“You gonna divorce him?” the boy asked insistently.

“That's not nice to ask the lady,” the woman rocking the carriage said.

“Listen,” the boy said. “I seen him. He went in there.” He pointed to the house next door. “I followed him,” the boy said. “He give me a quarter.” The boy dropped his voice to a growl, and said, “‘this is a big day for me, kid,’ he says. Give me a quarter.”

She gave him a dollar bill. “Where?” she said.

“Top floor,” the boy said. “I followed him till he give me the quarter. Way to the top.” He backed up the sidewalk, out of reach, with the dollar bill. “You gonna divorce him?” he asked again.

“Was he carrying flowers?”

“Yeah,” the boy said. He began to screech. “You gonna divorce him, missus? You got something on him?” He went careening down the street, howling, “She's got something on the poor guy,” and the woman rocking the baby laughed.

The street door of the apartment house was unlocked; there were no bells in the outer vestibule, and no lists of names. The stairs were narrow and dirty; there were two doors on the top floor. The front one was the right one; there was a crumpled florist's paper on the floor outside the door, and a knotted paper ribbon, like a clue, like the final clue in the paper-chase.

She knocked, and thought she heard voices inside, and she thought, suddenly, with terror, What shall I say if Jamie is there, if he comes to the door? The voices seemed suddenly still. She knocked again and there was silence, except for something that might have been laughter far away. He could have seen me from the window, she thought, it's the front apartment and that little boy made a dreadful noise. She waited, and knocked again, but there was silence.

Finally she went to the other door on the floor, and knocked. The door swung open beneath her hand and she saw the empty attic room, bare lath on the walls, floorboards unpainted. She stepped just inside, looking around; the room was filled with bags of plaster, piles of old newspapers, a broken trunk. There was a noise which she suddenly realized as a rat, and then she saw it, sitting very close to her, near the wall, its evil face alert, bright eyes watching her. She stumbled in her haste to be out with the door closed, and the skirt of the print dress caught and tore.

She knew there was someone inside the other apartment, because she was sure she could hear low voices and sometimes laughter. She came back many times, every day for the first week. She came on her way to work, in the mornings; in the evenings, on her way to dinner alone, but no matter how often or how firmly she knocked, no one ever came to the door.





The Witch


The coach was so nearly empty that the little boy had a seat all to himself, and his mother sat across the aisle on the seat next to the little boy's sister, a baby with a piece of toast in one hand and a rattle in the other. She was strapped securely to the seat so she could sit up and look around, and whenever she began to slip slowly sideways the strap caught her and held her halfway until her mother turned around and straightened her again. The little boy was looking out the window and eating a cookie, and the mother was reading quietly, answering the little boy's questions without looking up.

“We're on a river,” the little boy said. “This is a river and we're on it.”

“Fine,” his mother said.

“We're on a bridge over a river,” the little boy said to himself.

The few other people in the coach were sitting at the other end of the car, if any of then had occasion to come down the aisle the little boy would look around and say, “Hi,” and the stranger would usually say, “Hi,” back and sometimes ask the little boy if he were enjoying the train ride, or even tell him he was a fine big fellow. These comments annoyed the little boy and he would turn irritably back to the window.

“There's a cow,” he would say, or, sighing, “How far do we have to go?”

“Not much longer now,” his mother said, each time.

Once the baby, who was very quiet and busy with her rattle and her toast, which the mother would renew constantly, fell over too far sideways and banged her head. She began to cry, and for a minute there was noise and movement around the mother's seat. The little boy slid down from his own seat and ran across the aisle to pet his sister's feet and beg her not to cry, and finally the baby laughed and went back to her toast, and the little boy received a lollipop from his mother and went back to the window.

“I saw a witch,” he said to his mother after a minute. “There was a big old ugly old bad old witch outside.”

“Fine,” his mother said.

“A big old ugly witch and I told her to go away and she went away,” the little boy went on, in a quiet narrative to himself, “she came and said, ‘I'm going to eat you up,’ and I said, ‘no, you're not,’ and I chased her away, the bad old mean witch.”

He stopped talking and looked up as the outside door of the coach opened and a man came in. He was an elderly man, with a pleasant face under white hair; his blue suit was only faintly touched by the disarray that comes from a long train trip. He was carrying a cigar, and when the little boy said, “Hi,” the man gestured at him with the cigar and said, “Hello yourself, son.” He stopped just beside the little boy's seat, and leaned against the back, looking down at the little boy, who craned his neck to look upward. “What you looking for out that window?” the man asked.

“Witches,” the little boy said promptly. “Bad old mean witches.”

“I see,” the man said. “Find many?”

“My father smokes cigars,” the little boy said.

“All men smoke cigars,” the man said. “Someday you'll smoke a cigar, too.”

“I'm a man already,” the little boy said.

“How old are you?” the man asked.

The little boy, at the eternal question, looked at the man suspiciously for a minute and then said, “Twenty-six. Eight hunnerd and forty eighty.”

His mother lifted her head from the book. “Four,” she said, smiling fondly at the little boy.

“Is that so?” the man said politely to the little boy. “Twenty-six.” He nodded his head at the mother across the aisle. “Is that your mother?”

The little boy leaned forward to look and then said, “Yes, that's her.”

“What's your name?” the man asked.

The little boy looked suspicious again. “Mr. Jesus,” he said.

“Johnny,” the little boy's mother said. She caught the little boy's eye and frowned deeply.

“That's my sister over there,” the little boy said to the man. “She's twelve-and-a-half.”

“Do you love your sister?” the man asked. The little boy stared, and the man came around the side of the seat and sat down next to the little boy. “Listen,” the man said, “shall I tell you about my little sister?”

The mother, who had looked up anxiously when the man sat down next to her little boy, went peacefully back to her book.

“Tell me about your sister,” the little boy said. “Was she a witch?”

“Maybe,” the man said.

The little boy laughed excitedly, and the man leaned back and puffed at his cigar. “Once upon a time,” he began, “I had a little sister, just like yours.” The little boy looked up at the man, nodding at every word. “My little sister,” the man went on, “was so pretty and so nice that I loved her more than anything else in the world. So shall I tell you what I did?”

The little boy nodded more vehemently, and the mother lifted her eyes from her book and smiled, listening.

“I bought her a rocking-horse and a doll and a million lollipops,” the man said, “and then I took her and I put my hands around her neck and I pinched her and I pinched her until she was dead.”

The little boy gasped and the mother turned around, her smile fading. She opened her mouth, and then closed it again as the man went on, “And then I took and I cut her head off and I took her head—”

“Did you cut her all in pieces?” the little boy asked breathlessly.

“I cut off her head and her hands and her feet and her hair and her nose,” the man said, “and I hit her with a stick and I killed her.”

“Wait a minute,” the mother said, but the baby fell over sideways just at that minute and by the time the mother had set her up again the man was going on.

“And I took her head and I pulled out all her hair and—”

“Your little sister?” the little boy prompted eagerly.

“My little sister,” the man said firmly. “And I put her head in a cage with a bear and the bear ate it all up.”

“Ate her head all up?” the little boy asked.

The mother put her book down and came across the aisle. She stood next to the man and said,“Just what do you think you're doing?” The man looked up courteously and she said, “Get out of here.”

“Did I frighten you?” the man said. He looked down at the little boy and nudged him with an elbow and he and the little boy laughed.

“This man cut up his little sister,” the little boy said to his mother.

“I can very easily call the conductor,” the mother said to the man.

“The conductor will eat my mommy,” the little boy said. “We'll chop her head off.”

“And little sister's head, too,” the man said. He stood up, and the mother stood back to let him get out of the seat. “Don't ever come back in this car,” she said.

“My mommy will eat you,” the little boy said to the man.

The man laughed, and the little boy laughed, and then the man said, “Excuse me,” to the mother and went past her out of the car. When the door had closed behind him the little boy said, “How much longer do we have to stay on this old train?”

“Not much longer,” the mother said. She stood looking at the little boy, wanting to say something, and finally she said, “You sit still and be a good boy. You may have another lollipop.”

The little boy climbed down eagerly and followed his mother back to her seat. She took a lollipop from a bag in her pocketbook and gave it to him. “What do you say?” she asked.

“Thank you,” the little boy said. “Did that man really cut his little sister up in pieces?”

“He was just teasing,”the mother said, and added urgently, “Just teasing.”

“Prob'ly,” the little boy said. With his lollipop he went back to his own seat, and settled himself to look out the window again. “Prob'ly he was a witch.”





Flower Garden


After living in an old Vermont manor house together for almost eleven years, the two Mrs. Winnings, mother and daughter-in-law, had grown to look a good deal alike, as women will who live intimately together, and work in the same kitchen and get things done around the house in the same manner. Although young Mrs. Winning had been a Talbot, and had dark hair which she wore cut short, she was now officially a Winning, a member of the oldest family in town and her hair was beginning to grey where her mother-in-law's hair had greyed first, at the temples; they both had thin sharp-featured faces and eloquent hands, and sometimes when they were washing dishes or shelling peas or polishing silverware together, their hands, moving so quickly and similarly, communicated more easily and sympathetically than their minds ever could. Young Mrs. Winning thought sometimes, when she sat at the breakfast table next to her mother-in-law, with her baby girl in the high-chair close by, that they must resemble some stylized block print for a New England wallpaper; mother, daughter, and granddaughter, with perhaps Plymouth Rock or Concord Bridge in the background.

On this, as on other cold mornings, they lingered over their coffee, unwilling to leave the big kitchen with the coal stove and the pleasant atmosphere of food and cleanliness, and they sat together silently sometimes until the baby had long finished her breakfast and was playing quietly in the special baby corner, where uncounted Winning children had played with almost identical toys from the same heavy wooden box.

“It seems as though spring would never come,” young Mrs. Winning said. “I get so fired of the cold.”

“Got to be cold some of the time,” her mother-in-law said. She began to move suddenly and quickly, stacking plates, indicating that the time for sitting was over and the time for working had begun. Young Mrs. Winning, rising immediately to help, thought for the thousandth time that her mother-in-law would never relinquish the position of authority in her own house until she was too old to move before anyone else.

“And I wish someone would move into the old cottage,” young Mrs. Winning added. She stopped halfway to the pantry with the table napkins and said longingly, “If only someone would move in before spring.” Young Mrs. Winning had wanted, long ago, to buy the cottage herself, for her husband to make with his own hands into a home where they could live with their children, but now, accustomed as she was to the big old house at the top of the hill where her husband's family had lived for generations, she had only a great kindness left toward the little cottage, and a wistful anxiety to see some happy young people living there. When she heard it was sold, as all the old houses were being sold in these days when no one could seem to find a newer place to live, she had allowed herself to watch daily for a sign that someone new was coming; every morning she glanced down from the back porch to see if there was smoke coming out of the cottage chimney, and every day going down the hill on her way to the store she hesitated past the cottage, watching carefully for the least movement within. The cottage had been sold in January and now, nearly two months later, even though it seemed prettier and less worn with the snow gently covering the overgrown garden and icicles in front of the blank windows, it was still forlorn and empty, despised since the day long ago when Mrs. Winning had given up all hope of ever living there.

Mrs. Winning deposited the napkins in the pantry and turned to tear the leaf off the kitchen calendar before selecting a dish towel and joining her mother-in-law at the sink. “March already,” she said despondently.

“They did tell me down at the store yesterday,” her mother-in-law said, “that they were going to start painting the cottage this week.”

“Then that must mean someone's coming!”

“Can't take more than a couple of weeks to paint inside that little house,” old Mrs. Winning said.




It was almost April, however, before the new people moved in. The snow had almost melted and was running down the street in icy, half-solid rivers. The ground was slushy and miserable to walk on, the skies grey and dull. In another month the first amazing green would start in the trees and on the ground, but for the better part of April there would be cold rain and perhaps more snow. The cottage had been painted inside, and new paper put on the walls. The front steps had been repaired and new glass put into the broken windows. In spite of the grey sky and the patches of dirty snow the cottage looked neater and firmer, and the painters were coming back to do the outside when the weather cleared. Mrs. Winning, standing at the foot of the cottage walk, tried to picture the cottage as it stood now, against the picture of the cottage she had made years ago, when she had hoped to live there herself. She had wanted roses by the porch; that could be done, and the neat colorful garden she had planned. She would have painted the outside white, and that too might still be done. Since the cottage had been sold she had not gone inside, but she remembered the little rooms, with the windows over the garden that could be so bright with gay curtains and window boxes, the small kitchen she would have painted yellow, the two bedrooms upstairs with slanting ceilings under the eaves. Mrs. Winning looked at the cottage for a long time, standing on the wet walk, and then went slowly on down to the store.

The first news she had of the new people came, at last, from the grocer a few days later. As he was tying the string around the three pounds of hamburger the large Winning family would consume in one meal, he asked cheerfully, “Seen your new neighbors yet?”

“Have they moved in?” Mrs. Winning asked. “The people in the cottage?”

“Lady in here this morning,” the grocer said. “Lady and a little boy, seem like nice people. They say her husband's dead. Nice-looking lady.”

Mrs. Winning had been born in the town and the grocer's father had given her jawbreakers and licorice in the grocery store while the present grocer was still in high school. For a while, when she was twelve and the grocer's son was twenty, Mrs. Winning had hoped secretly that he would want to marry her. He was fleshy now, and middle-aged, and although he still called her Helen and she still called him Tom, she belonged now to the Winning family and had to speak critically to him, no matter how unwillingly, if the meat were tough or the butter price too high. She knew that when he spoke of the new neighbor as a “lady” he meant something different than if he had spoken of her as a “woman” or a “person.” Mrs. Winning knew that he spoke of the two Mrs. Winnings to his other customers as “ladies.” She hesitated and then asked, “Have they really moved in to stay?”

“She'll have to stay for a while,” the grocer said drily. “Bought a week's worth of groceries.”

Going back up the hill with her package Mrs. Winning watched all the way to detect some sign of the new people in the cottage. When she reached the cottage walk she slowed down and tried to watch not too obviously. There was no smoke coming from the chimney, and no sign of furniture near the house, as there might have been if people were still moving in, but there was a middle-aged car parked in the street before the cottage and Mrs. Winning thought she could see figures moving past the windows. On a sudden irresistible impulse she turned and went up the walk to the front porch, and then, after debating for a moment, on up the steps to the door. She knocked, holding her bag of groceries in one arm, and then the door opened and she looked down on a little boy, about the same age, she thought happily, as her own son.

“Hello,” Mrs. Winning said.

“Hello,” the boy said. He regarded her soberly.

“Is your mother here?” Mrs. Winning asked. “I came to see if I could help her move in.”

“We're all moved in,” the boy said. He was about to close the door, but a woman's voice said from somewhere in the house, “Davey? Are you talking to someone?”

“That's my mommy,” the little boy said. The woman came up behind him and opened the door a little wider. “Yes?” she said.

Mrs. Winning said, “I'm Helen Winning. I live about three houses up the street, and I thought perhaps I might be able to help you.”

“Thank you,” the woman said doubtfully. She's younger than I am, Mrs. Winning thought, she's about thirty. And pretty. For a clear minute Mrs. Winning saw why the grocer had called her a lady.

“It's so nice to have someone living in this house,” Mrs. Winning said shyly. Past the other woman's head she could see the small hallway, with the larger living-room beyond and the door on the left going into the kitchen, the stairs on the right, with the delicate stair-rail newly painted; they had done the hall in light green, and Mrs. Winning smiled with friendship at the woman in the doorway, thinking, She has done it right; this is the way it should look after all, she knows about pretty houses.

After a minute the other woman smiled back, and said, “Will you come in?”

As she stepped back to let Mrs. Winning in, Mrs. Winning wondered with a suddenly stricken conscience if perhaps she had not been too forward, almost pushing herself in... “I hope I'm not making a nuisance of myself,” she said unexpectedly, turning to the other woman. “It's just that I've been wanting to live here myself for so long.” Why did I say that, she wondered; it had been a very long time since young Mrs. Winning had said the first thing that came into her head.

“Come see my room,” the little boy said urgently, and Mrs. Winning smiled down at him.

“I have a little boy just about your age,” she said. “What's your name?”

“Davey,” the little boy said, moving closer to his mother. “Davey William MacLane.”

“My little boy,” Mrs. Winning said soberly, “is named Howard Talbot Winning.”

The little boy looked up at his mother uncertainly, and Mrs. Winning, who felt ill at ease and awkward in this little house she so longed for, said, “How old are you? My little boy is five.”

“I'm five,” the little boy said, as though realizing it for the first time. He looked again at his mother and she said graciously, “Will you come in and see what we've done to the house?”

Mrs. Winning put her bag of groceries down on the slim-legged table in the green hall, and followed Mrs. MacLane into the living-room, which was L-shaped and had the windows Mrs. Winning would have fitted with gay curtains and flower-boxes. As she stepped into the room Mrs. Winning realized, with a quick wonderful relief, that it was really going to be all right, after all. Everything, from the andirons in the fireplace to the books on the table, was exactly as Mrs. Winning might have done if she were eleven years younger; a little more informal, perhaps, nothing of quite such good quality as young Mrs. Winning might have chosen, but still richly, undeniably right. There was a picture of Davey on the mantel, flanked by a picture which Mrs. Winning supposed was Davey's father; there was a glorious blue bowl on the low coffee table, and around the corner of the L stood a row of orange plates on a shelf, and a polished maple table and chairs.

“It's lovely,” Mrs. Winning said. This could have been mine, she was thinking, and she stood in the doorway and said again, “It's perfectly lovely.”

Mrs. MacLane crossed over to the low armchair by the fireplace and picked up the soft blue material that lay across the arm. “I'm making curtains,” she said, and touched the blue bowl with the tip of one finger. “Somehow I always make my blue bowl the center of the room,” she said. “I'm having the curtains the same blue, and my rug—when it comes!—will have the same blue in the design.”

“It matches Davey's eyes,” Mrs. Winning said, and when Mrs. MacLane smiled again she saw that it matched Mrs. MacLane's eyes too. Helpless before so much that was magic to her, Mrs. Winning said “Have you painted the kitchen yellow?”

“Yes,” Mrs. MacLane said, surprised. “Come and see.” She led the way through the L, around past the orange plates to the kitchen, which caught the late morning sun and shone with clean paint and bright aluminum; Mrs. Winning noticed the electric coffeepot, the waffle iron, the toaster, and thought, she couldn't have much trouble cooking, not with just the two of them.

“When I have a garden,” Mrs. MacLane said, “we'll be able to see it from almost all the windows.” She gestured to the broad kitchen windows, and added, “I love gardens. I imagine I'll spend most of my time working in this one, as soon as the weather is nice.”

“It's a good house for a garden,” Mrs. Winning said. “I've heard that it used to be one of the prettiest gardens on the block.”

“I thought so too,” Mrs. MacLane said. “I'm going to have flowers on all four sides of the house. With a cottage like this you can, you know.”

Oh, I know, I know, Mrs. Winning thought wistfully, remembering the neat charming garden she could have had, instead of the row of nasturtiums along the side of the Winning house, which she tended so carefully; no flowers would grow well around the Winning house, because of the heavy old maple trees which shaded all the yard and which had been tall when the house was built.

Mrs. MacLane had had the bathroom upstairs done in yellow, too, and the two small bedrooms with overhanging eaves were painted green and rose. “All garden colors,” she told Mrs. Winning gaily, and Mrs. Winning, thinking of the oddly-matched, austere bedrooms in the big Winning house, sighed and admitted that it would be wonderful to have window seats under the eaved windows. Davey's bedroom was the green one, and his small bed was close to the window. “This morning,” he told Mrs. Winning solemnly, “I looked out and there were four icicles hanging by my bed.”

Mrs. Winning stayed in the cottage longer than she should have; she felt certain, although Mrs. MacLane was pleasant and cordial, that her visit was extended past courtesy and into curiosity. Even so, it was only her sudden guilt about the three pounds of hamburger and dinner for the Winning men that drove her away. When she left, waving good-bye to Mrs. MacLane and Davey as they stood in the cottage doorway, she had invited Davey up to play with Howard, Mrs. MacLane up for tea, both of them to come for lunch some day, and all without the permission of her mother-in-law.

Reluctantly she came to the big house and turned past the bolted front door to go up the walk to the back door, which all the family used in the winter. Her mother-in-law looked up as she came into the kitchen and said irritably, “I called the store and Tom said you left an hour ago.”

“I stopped off at the old cottage,” Mrs. Winning said. She put the package of groceries down on the table and began to take things out quickly, to get the doughnuts on to a plate and the hamburger into the pan before too much time was lost. With her coat still on and her scarf over her head she moved as fast as she could while her mother-in-law, slicing bread at the kitchen table, watched her silently.

“Take your coat off,” her mother-in-law said finally. “Your husband will be home in a minute.”

By twelve o'clock the house was noisy and full of mud tracked across the kitchen floor. The oldest Howard, Mrs. Winning's father-in-law, came in from the farm and went silently to hang his hat and coat in the dark hall before speaking to his wife and daughter-in-law; the younger Howard, Mrs. Winning's husband, came in from the barn after putting the truck away and nodded to his wife and kissed his mother; and the youngest Howard, Mrs. Winning's son, crashed into the kitchen, home from kindergarten, shouting, “Where's dinner?”

The baby, anticipating food, banged on her high-chair with the silver cup which had first been used by the oldest Howard Winning's mother. Mrs. Winning and her mother-in-law put plates down on the table swiftly, knowing after many years the exact pause between the latest arrival and the serving of food, and with a minimum of time three generations of the Winning family were eating silently and efficiently, all anxious to be back about their work: the farm, the mill, the electric train; the dishes, the sewing, the nap. Mrs. Winning, feeding the baby, trying to anticipate her mother-in-law's gestures of serving, thought, today more poignantly than ever before, that she had at least given them another Howard, with the Winning eyes and mouth, in exchange for her food and her bed.

After dinner, after the men had gone back to work and the children were in bed, the baby for her nap and Howard resting with crayons and coloring book, Mrs. Winning sat down with her mother-in-law over their sewing and tried to describe the cottage.

“It's just perfect,” she said helplessly. “Everything is so pretty. She invited us to come down some day and see it when it's all finished, the curtains and everything.”

“I was talking to Mrs. Blake,” the elder Mrs. Winning said, as though in agreement. “She says the husband was killed in an automobile accident. She had some money in her own name and I guess she decided to settle down in the country for the boy's health. Mrs. Blake said he looked peakish.”

“She loves gardens,” Mrs. Winning said, her needle still in her hand for a moment. “She's going to have a big garden all around the house.”

“She'll need help,” the elder woman said humorlessly, “that's a mighty big garden she'll have.”

“She has the most beautiful blue bowl, Mother Winning. You'd love it, it's almost like silver.”

“Probably,” the elder Mrs. Winning said after a pause, “probably her people came from around here a ways back, and that's why she's settled in these parts.”




The next day Mrs. Winning walked slowly past the cottage, and slowly the next, and the day after, and the day after that. On the second day she saw Mrs. MacLane at the window, and waved, and on the third day she met Davey on the sidewalk. “When are you coming to visit my little boy?” she asked him, and he stared at her solemnly and said, “Tomorrow.”

Mrs. Burton, next-door to the MacLanes, ran over on the third day they were there with a fresh apple pie, and then told all the neighbors about the yellow kitchen and the bright electric utensils. Another neighbor, whose husband had helped Mrs. MacLane start her furnace, explained that Mrs. MacLane was only very recently widowed. One or another of the townspeople called on the MacLanes almost daily, and frequently, as young Mrs. Winning passed, she saw familiar faces at the windows, measuring the blue curtains with Mrs. MacLane, or she waved to acquaintances who stood chatting with Mrs. MacLane on the now firm front steps. After the MacLanes had been in the cottage for about a week Mrs. Winning met them one day in the grocery and they walked up the hill together, and talked about putting Davey into the kindergarten. Mrs. MacLane wanted to keep him home as long as possible, and Mrs. Winning asked her, “Don't you feel terribly tied down, having him with you all the time?”

“I like it,” Mrs. MacLane said cheerfully, “we keep each other company,” and Mrs. Winning felt clumsy and ill-mannered, remembering Mrs. MacLane's widowhood.

As the weather grew warmer and the first signs of green showed on the trees and on the wet ground, Mrs. Winning and Mrs. MacLane became better friends. They met almost daily at the grocery and walked up the hill together, and twice Davey came up to play with Howard's electric train, and once Mrs. MacLane came up to get him and stayed for a cup of coffee in the great kitchen while the boys raced round and round the table and Mrs. Winning's mother-in-law was visiting a neighbor.

“It's such an old house,” Mrs. MacLane said, looking up at the dark ceiling. “I love old houses; they feel so secure and warm, as though lots of people had been perfectly satisfied with them and they knew how useful they were. You don't get that feeling with a new house.”

“This dreary old place,” Mrs. Winning said. Mrs. MacLane, with a rose-colored sweater and her bright soft hair, was a spot of color in the kitchen that Mrs. Winning knew she could never duplicate. “I'd give anything in the world to live in your house,” Mrs. Winning said.

“I love it,” Mrs. MacLane said. “I don't think I've ever been so happy. Everyone around here is so nice, and the house is so pretty, and I planted a lot of bulbs yesterday.” She laughed. “I used to sit in that apartment in New York and dream about planting bulbs again.”

Mrs. Winning looked at the boys, thinking how Howard was half-a-head taller, and stronger, and how Davey was small and weak and loved his mother adoringly. “It's been good for Davey already,” she said. “There's color in his cheeks.”

“Davey loves it,” Mrs. MacLane agreed. Hearing his name Davey came over and put his head in her lap and she touched his hair, bright like her own. “We'd better be getting on home, Davey boy,” she said.

“Maybe our flowers have grown some since yesterday,” said Davey.




Gradually the days became miraculously long and warm, and Mrs. MacLane's garden began to show colors and became an ordered thing, still very young and unsure, but promising rich brilliance for the end of the summer, and the next summer, and summers ten years from now.

“It's even better than I hoped,” Mrs. MacLane said to Mrs. Winning, standing at the garden gate. “Things grow so much better here than almost anywhere else.”

Davey and Howard played daily after the school was out for the summer, and Howard was free all day. Sometimes Howard stayed at Davey's house for lunch, and they planted a vegetable patch together in the MacLane back yard. Mrs. Winning stopped for Mrs. MacLane on her way to the store in the mornings and Davey and Howard frolicked ahead of them down the street. They picked up their mail together and read it walking back up the hill, and Mrs. Winning went more cheerfully back to the big Winning house after walking most of the way home with Mrs. MacLane.

One afternoon Mrs. Winning put the baby in Howard's wagon and with the two boys they went for a long walk in the country. Mrs. MacLane picked Queen Anne's lace and put it into the wagon with the baby, and the boys found a garter snake and tried to bring it home. On the way up the hill Mrs. MacLane helped pull the wagon with the baby and the Queen Anne's lace, and they stopped halfway to rest and Mrs. MacLane said, “Look, I believe you can see my garden all the way from here.”

It was a spot of color almost at the top of the hill and they stood looking at it while the baby threw the Queen Anne's lace out of the wagon. Mrs. MacLane said, “I always want to stop here to look at it,” and then, “Who is that beautiful child?”

Mrs. Winning looked, and then laughed. “He is attractive, isn't he,” she said. “It's Billy Jones.” She looked at him herself, carefully, trying to see him as Mrs. MacLane would. He was a boy about twelve, sitting quietly on a wall across the street, with his chin in his hands, silently watching Davey and Howard.

“He's like a young statue,” Mrs. MacLane said. “So brown, and, will you look at that face?” She started to walk again to see him more clearly, and Mrs. Winning followed her. “Do I know his mother and fath—”

“The Jones children are half-Negro,” Mrs. Winning said hastily. “But they're all beautiful children; you should see the girl. They live just outside town.”

Howard's voice reached them clearly across the summer air. “Nigger,” he was saying, “nigger, nigger boy.”

“Nigger,” Davey repeated, giggling.

Mrs. MacLane gasped, and then said, “Davey,” in a voice that made Davey turn his head apprehensively; Mrs. Winning had never heard her friend use such a voice, and she too watched Mrs. MacLane.

“Davey,” Mrs. MacLane said again, and Davey approached slowly. “What did I hear you say?”

“Howard,” Mrs. Winning said, “leave Billy alone.”

“Go tell that boy you're sorry,” Mrs. MacLane said. “Go at once and tell him you're sorry.”

Davey blinked tearfully at his mother and then went to the curb and called across the street, “I'm sorry.”

Howard and Mrs. Winning waited uneasily, and Billy Jones across the street raised his head from his hands and looked at Davey and then, for a long time, at Mrs. MacLane. Then he put his chin on his hands again.

Suddenly Mrs. MacLane called, “Young man—Will you come here a minute, please?”

Mrs. Winning was surprised, and stared at Mrs. MacLane, but when the boy across the street did not move Mrs. Winning said sharply, “Billy! Billy Jones! Come here at once!”

The boy raised his head and looked at them, and then slid slowly down from the wall and started across the street. When he was across the street and about five feet from them he stopped, waiting.

“Hello,” Mrs. MacLane said gently, “what's your name?”

The boy looked at her for a minute and then at Mrs. Winning, and Mrs. Winning said, “He's Billy Jones. Answer when you're spoken to, Billy.”

“Billy,” Mrs. MacLane said, “I'm sorry my little boy called you a name, but he's very little and he doesn't always know what he's saying. But he's sorry, too.”

“Okay,” Billy said, still watching Mrs. Winning. He was wearing an old pair of blue jeans and a torn white shirt, and he was barefoot. His skin and hair were the same color, the golden shade of a very heavy tan, and his hair curled lightly; he had the look of a garden statue.

“Billy,” Mrs. MacLane said, “how would you like to come and work for me? Earn some money?”

“Sure,” Billy said.

“Do you like gardening?” Mrs. MacLane asked. Billy nodded soberly. “Because,” Mrs. MacLane went on enthusiastically, “I've been needing someone to help me with my garden, and it would be just the thing for you to do.” She waited a minute and then said, “Do you know where I live?”

“Sure,” Billy said. He turned his eyes away from Mrs. Winning and for a minute looked at Mrs. MacLane, his brown eyes expressionless. Then he looked back at Mrs. Winning, who was watching Howard up the street.

“Fine,” Mrs. MacLane said. “Will you come tomorrow?”

“Sure,” Billy said. He waited for a minute, looking from Mrs. MacLane to Mrs. Winning, and then ran back across the street and vaulted over the wall where he had been sitting. Mrs. MacLane watched him admiringly. Then she smiled at Mrs. Winning and gave the wagon a tug to start it up the hill again. They were nearly at the MacLane cottage before Mrs. MacLane finally spoke. “I just can't stand that,” she said, “to hear children attacking people for things they can't help.”

“They're strange people, the Joneses,” Mrs. Winning said readily. “The father works around as a handyman; maybe you've seen him. You see—” she dropped her voice—“the mother was white, a girl from around here. A local girl,” she said again, to make it more clear to a foreigner. “She left the whole litter of them when Billy was about two, and went off with a white man.”

“Poor children,” Mrs. MacLane said.

“They're all right,” Mrs. Winning said. “The church takes care of them, of course, and people are always giving them things. The girl's old enough to work now, too. She's sixteen, but...”

“But what?” Mrs. MacLane said, when Mrs. Winning hesitated.

“Well, people talk about her a lot, you know,” Mrs. Winning said. “Think of her mother, after all. And there's another boy, couple of years older than Billy.”

They stopped in front of the MacLane cottage and Mrs. MacLane touched Davey's hair. “Poor unfortunate child,” she said.

“Children will call names,” Mrs. Winning said. “There's not much you can do.”

“Well...” Mrs. MacLane said. “Poor child.”




The next day, after the dinner dishes were washed, and while Mrs. Winning and her mother-in-law were putting them away, the elder Mrs. Winning said casually, “Mrs. Blake tells me your friend Mrs. MacLane was asking around the neighbors how to get hold of the Jones boy.”

“She wants someone to help in the garden, I think,” Mrs. Winning said weakly. “She needs help in that big garden.”

“Not that kind of help,” the elder Mrs. Winning said. “You tell her about them?”

“She seemed to feel sorry for them,” Mrs. Winning said, from the depths of the pantry. She took a long time settling the plates in even stacks in order to neaten her mind. She shouldn't have done it, she was thinking, but her mind refused to tell her why. She should have asked me first, though, she thought finally.

The next day Mrs. Winning stopped off at the cottage with Mrs. MacLane after coming up the hill from the store. They sat in the yellow kitchen and drank coffee, while the boys played in the back yard. While they were discussing the possibilities of hammocks between the apple trees there was a knock at the kitchen door and when Mrs. MacLane opened it she found a man standing there, so that she said, “Yes?” politely and waited.

“Good morning,” the man said. He took off his hat and nodded his head at Mrs. MacLane. “Billy told me you was looking for someone to work your garden,” he said.

“Why...” Mrs. MacLane began, glancing sideways uneasily at Mrs. Winning.

“I'm Billy's father,” the man said. He nodded his head toward the back yard and Mrs. MacLane saw Billy Jones sitting under one of the apple trees, his arms folded in front of him, his eyes on the grass at his feet.

“How do you do,” Mrs. MacLane said inadequately.

“Billy told me you said for him to come work your garden,” the man said. “Well, now, I think maybe a summer job's too much for a boy his age, he ought to be out playing in the good weather. And that's the kind of work I do anyway, so's I thought I'd just come over and see if you found anyone yet.”

He was a big man, very much like Billy, except that where Billy's hair curled only a little, his father's hair curled tightly, with a line around his head where his hat stayed constantly and where Billy's skin was a golden tan, his father's skin was darker, almost bronze. When he moved, it was gracefully, like Billy, and his eyes were the same fathomless brown. “Like to work this garden,” Mr. Jones said, looking around. “Could be a mighty nice place.”

“You were very nice to come,” Mrs. MacLane said. “I certainly do need help.”

Mrs. Winning sat silently, not wanting to speak in front of Mr. Jones. She was thinking, I wish she'd ask me first, this is impossible... and Mr. Jones stood silently, listening courteously, with his dark eyes on Mrs. MacLane while she spoke. “I guess a lot of the work would be too much for a boy like Billy,” she said. “There are a lot of things I can't even do myself, and I was sort of hoping I could get someone to give me a hand.”

“That's fine, then,” Mr. Jones said. “Guess I can manage most of it,” he said, and smiled.

“Well,” Mrs. MacLane said, “I guess that's all settled, then. When do you want to start?”

“How about right now?” he said.

“Grand,” Mrs. MacLane said enthusiastically, and then, “Excuse me for a minute,” to Mrs. Winning over her shoulder. She took down her gardening gloves and wide straw hat from the shelf by the door. “Isn't it a lovely day?” she asked Mr. Jones as she stepped out into the garden while he stood back to let her pass.

“You go along home now, Bill,” Mr. Jones called as they went toward the side of the house.

“Oh, why not let him stay?” Mrs. MacLane said. Mrs. Winning heard her voice going on as they went out of sight. “He can play around the garden, and he'd probably enjoy...”

For a minute Mrs. Winning sat looking at the garden, at the corner around which Mr. Jones had followed Mrs. MacLane, and then Howard's face appeared around the side of the door and he said, “Hi, is it nearly time to eat?”

“Howard,” Mrs. Winning said quietly, and he came in through the door and came over to her. “It's time for you to run along home,” Mrs. Winning said. “I'll be along in a minute.”

Howard started to protest, but she added, “I want you to go right away. Take my bag of groceries if you think you can carry it.”

Howard was impressed by her conception of his strength, and he lifted down the bag of groceries; his shoulders, already broad out of proportion, like his father's and his grandfather's, strained under the weight, and then he steadied on his feet. “Aren't I strong?” he asked exultantly.

“Very strong,” Mrs. Winning said. “Tell Grandma I'll be right up. I'll just say good-bye to Mrs. MacLane.”

Howard disappeared through the house; Mrs. Winning heard him walking heavily under the groceries, out through the open front door and down the steps. Mrs. Winning rose and was standing by the kitchen door when Mrs. MacLane came back.

“You're not ready to go?” Mrs. MacLane exclaimed when she saw Mrs. Winning with her jacket on. “Without finishing your coffee?”

“I'd better catch Howard,” Mrs. Winning said. “He ran along ahead.”

“I'm sorry I left you like that,” Mrs. MacLane said. She stood in the doorway beside Mrs. Winning, looking out into the garden. “How wonderful it all is,” she said, and laughed happily.

They walked together through the house; the blue curtains were up by now, and the rug with the touch of blue in the design was on the floor.

“Good-bye,” Mrs. Winning said on the front steps.

Mrs. MacLane was smiling, and following her look Mrs. Winning turned and saw Mr. Jones, his shirt off and his strong back shining in the sun as he bent with a scythe over the long grass at the side of the house. Billy lay nearby, under the shade of the bushes; he was playing with a grey kitten. “I'm going to have the finest garden in town,” Mrs. MacLane said proudly.

“You won't have him working here past today, will you?” Mrs. Winning asked. “Of course you won't have him any longer than just today?”

“But surely—” Mrs. MacLane began, with a tolerant smile, and Mrs. Winning, after looking at her for an incredulous minute, turned and started, indignant and embarrassed, up the hill.

Howard had brought the groceries safely home and her mother-in-law was already setting the table.

“Howard says you sent him home from MacLane's,” her mother-in-law said, and Mrs. Winning answered briefly, “I thought it was getting late.”

The next morning when Mrs. Winning reached the cottage on her way down to the store she saw Mr. Jones swinging the scythe expertly against the side of the house, and Billy Jones and Davey sitting on the front steps watching him. “Good morning, Davey.” Mrs. Winning called, “is your mother ready to go downstreet?”

“Where's Howard?” Davey asked, not moving.

“He stayed home with his grandma today,” Mrs. Winning said brightly. “Is your mother ready?”

“She's making lemonade for Billy and me,” Davey said. “We're going to have it in the garden.”

“Then tell her,” Mrs. Winning said quickly, “tell her that I said I was in a hurry and that I had to go on ahead. I'll see her later.” She hurried on down the hill.

In the store she met Mrs. Harris, a lady whose mother had worked for the elder Mrs. Winning nearly forty years before. “Helen,” Mrs. Harris said, “you get greyer every year. You ought to stop all this running around.”

Mrs. Winning, in the store without Mrs. MacLane for the first time in weeks, smiled shyly and said that she guessed she needed a vacation.

“Vacation!” Mrs. Harris said. “Let that husband of yours do the housework for a change. He doesn't have nuthin' else to do.”

She laughed richly, and shook her head. “Nuthin' else to do,” she said. “The Winnings!”

Before Mrs. Winning could step away Mrs. Harris added, her laughter penetrated by a sudden sharp curiosity: “Where's that dressed-up friend of yours get to? Usually downstreet together, ain't you?”

Mrs. Winning smiled courteously, and Mrs. Harris said, laughing again, “Just couldn't believe those shoes of hers, first time I seen them. Them shoes!”

While she was laughing again Mrs. Winning escaped to the meat counter and began to discuss the potentialities of pork shoulder earnestly with the grocer. Mrs. Harris only says what everyone else says, she was thinking, are they talking like that about Mrs. MacLane? Are they laughing at her? When she thought of Mrs. MacLane she thought of the quiet house, the soft colors, the mother and son in the garden; Mrs. MacLane's shoes were green and yellow platform sandals, odd-looking certainly next to Mrs. Winning's solid white oxfords, but so inevitably right for Mrs. MacLane's house, and her garden... Mrs. Harris came up behind her and said, laughing again, “What's she got, that Jones fellow working for her now?”

When Mrs. Winning reached home, after hurrying up the hill past the cottage, where she saw no one, her mother-in-law was waiting for her in front of the house, watching her come the last few yards. “Early enough today,” her mother-in-law said. “MacLane out of town?”

Resentful, Mrs. Winrling said only, “Mrs. Harris nearly drove me out of the store, with her jokes.”

“Nothing wrong with Lucy Harris getting away from that man of hers wouldn't cure,” the elder Mrs. Winning said. Together, they began to walk around the house to the back door. Mrs. Winning, as they walked, noticed that the grass under the trees had greened up nicely, and that the nasturtiums beside the house were bright.

“I've got something to say to you, Helen,” the elder Mrs. Winning said finally.

“Yes?” her daughter-in-law said.

“It's the MacLane girl, about her, I mean. You know her so well, you ought to talk to her about that colored man working there.”

“I suppose so,” Mrs. Winning said.

“You sure you told her? You told her about those people?”

“I told her,” Mrs. Winning said.

“He's there every blessed day,” her mother-in-law said. “And working out there without his shirt on. He goes in the house.”

And that evening Mr. Burton, next-door neighbor to Mrs. MacLane, dropped in to see the Howard Winnings about getting a new lot of shingles at the mill; he turned, suddenly, to Mrs. Winning, who was sitting sewing next to her mother-in-law at the table in the front room, and raised his voice a little when he said, “Helen, I wish you'd tell your friend Mrs. MacLane to keep that kid of hers out of my vegetables.”

“Davey?” Mrs. Winning said involuntarily.

“No,” Mr. Burton said, while all the Winnings looked at the younger Mrs. Winning, “no, the other one, the colored boy. He's been running loose through our back yard. Makes me sort of mad, that kid coming in spoiling other people's property. You know,” he added, turning to the Howard Winnings, “you know, that does make a person mad.” There was a silence, and then Mr. Burton added, rising heavily, “Guess I'll say goodnight to you people.”

They all attended him to the door and came back to their work in silence. I've got to do something, Mrs. Winning was thinking, pretty soon they'll stop coming to me first, they'll tell someone else to speak to me. She looked up, found her mother-in-law looking at her, and they both looked down quickly.

Consequently Mrs. Winning went to the store the next morning earlier than usual, and she and Howard crossed the street just above the MacLane house, and went down the hill on the other side.

“Aren't we going to see Davey?” Howard asked once, and Mrs. Winning said carelessly, “Not today, Howard. Maybe your father will take you out to the mill this afternoon.”

She avoided looking across the street at the MacLane house, and hurried to keep up with Howard.




Mrs. Winning met Mrs. MacLane occasionally after that at the store or the post office, and they spoke pleasantly. When Mrs. Winning passed the cottage after the first week or so, she was no longer embarrassed about going by, and even looked at it frankly once or twice. The garden was going beautifully; Mr. Jones's broad back was usually visible through the bushes, and Billy Jones sat on the steps or lay on the grass with Davey.

One morning on her way down the hill Mrs. Winning heard a conversation between Davey MacLane and Billy Jones; they were in the bushes together and she heard Davey's high familiar voice saying, “Billy, you want to build a house with me today?”

“Okay,” Billy said. Mrs. Winning slowed her steps a little to hear.

“We'll build a big house out of branches,” Davey said excitedly, “and when it's finished we'll ask my mommy if we can have lunch out there.”

“You can't build a house just out of branches,” Billy said. “You ought to have wood, and boards.”

“And chairs and tables and dishes,” Davey agreed. “And walls.”

“Ask your mommy can we have two chairs out here,” Billy said. “Then we can pretend the whole garden is our house.”

“And I'll get us some cookies, too,” Davey said. “And we'll ask my mommy and your daddy to come in our house.” Mrs. Winning heard them shouting as she went down along the sidewalk.

You have to admit, she told herself as though she were being strictly just, you have to admit that he's doing a lot with that garden; it's the prettiest garden on the street. And Billy acts as though he had as much right there as Davey.

As the summer wore on into long hot days undistinguishable one from another, so that it was impossible to tell with any real accuracy whether the light shower had been yesterday or the day before, the Winnings moved out into their yard to sit after supper, and in the warm darkness Mrs. Winning sometimes found an opportunity of sitting next to her husband so that she could touch his arm; she was never able to teach Howard to run to her and put his head in her lap, or inspire him with other than the perfunctory Winning affection, but she consoled herself with the thought that at least they were a family, a solid respectable thing.

The hot weather kept up, and Mrs. Winning began to spend more time in the store, postponing the long aching walk up the hill in the sun. She stopped and chatted with the grocer, with other young mothers in the town, with older friends of her mother-in-law's, talking about the weather, the reluctance of the town to put in a decent swimming pool, the work that had to be done before school started in the fall, chickenpox, the P. T. A. One morning she met Mrs. Burton in the store, and they spoke of their husbands, the heat, and the hot-weather occupations of their children before Mrs. Burton said: “By the way, Johnny will be six on Saturday and he's having a birthday party; can Howard come?”

“Wonderful,” Mrs. Winning said, thinking, His good white shorts, the dark blue shirt, a carefully-wrapped present.

“Just about eight children,” Mrs. Burton said, with the loving carelessness mothers use in planning the birthday parties of their children. “They'll stay for supper, of course—send Howard down about three-thirty.”

“That sounds so nice,” Mrs. Winning said. “He'll be delighted when I tell him.”

“I thought I'd have them all play outdoors most of the time,” Mrs. Burton said. “In this weather. And then perhaps a few games indoors, and supper. Keep it simple—you know.” She hesitated, running her finger around and around the top rim of a can of coffee. “Look,” she said, “I hope you won't mind me asking, but would it be all right with you if I didn't invite the MacLane boy?”

Mrs. Winning felt sick for a minute, and had to wait for her voice to even out before she said lightly, “It's all right with me if it's all right with you; why do you have to ask me?”

Mrs. Burton laughed. “I just thought you might mind if he didn't come.”

Mrs. Winning was thinking. Something bad has happened, somehow people think they know something about me that they won't say, they all pretend it's nothing, but this never happened to me before; I live with the Winnings, don't I? “Really,” she said, putting the weight of the old Winning house into her voice, “why in the world would it bother me?” Did I take it too seriously, she was wondering, did I seem too anxious, should I have let it go?

Mrs. Burton was embarrassed, and she set the can of coffee down on the shelf and began to examine the other shelves studiously. “I'm sorry I mentioned it at all,” she said.

Mrs. Winning felt that she had to say something further, something to state her position with finality, so that no longer would Mrs. Burton, at least, dare to use such a tone to a Winning, presume to preface a question with “I hope you don't mind me asking.” “After all,” Mrs. Winning said carefully, weighing the words, “she's like a second mother to Billy.”

Mrs. Burton, turning to look at Mrs. Winning for confirmation, grimaced and said, “Good Lord, Helen!”

Mrs. Winning shrugged and then smiled and Mrs. Burton smiled and then Mrs. Winning said, “I do feel so sorry for the little boy, though.”

Mrs. Burton said, “Such a sweet little thing, too.”

Mrs. Winning had just said, “He and Billy are together all the time now,” when she looked up and saw Mrs. MacLane regarding her from the end of the aisle of shelves; it was impossible to tell whether she had heard them or not. For a minute Mrs. Winning looked steadily back at Mrs. MacLane, and then she said, with just the right note of cordiality, “Good morning, Mrs. MacLane. Where is your little boy this morning?”

“Good morning, Mrs. Winning,” Mrs. MacLane said, and moved on past the aisle of shelves, and Mrs. Burton caught Mrs. Winning's arm and made a desperate gesture of hiding her face and, unable to help themselves, both she and Mrs. Winning began to laugh.




Soon after that, although the grass in the Winning yard under the maple trees stayed smooth and green, Mrs. Winning began to notice in her daily trips past the cottage that Mrs. MacLane's garden was suffering from the heat. The flowers wilted under the morning sun, and no longer stood up fresh and bright; the grass was browning slightly and the rose bushes Mrs. MacLane had put in so optimistically were noticeably dying. Mr. Jones seemed always cool, working steadily; sometimes bent down with his hands in the earth, sometimes tall against the side of the house, setting up a trellis or pruning a tree, but the blue curtains hung lifelessly at the windows. Mrs. MacLane still smiled at Mrs. Winning in the store, and then one day they met at the gate of Mrs. MacLane's garden and, after hesitating for a minute, Mrs. MacLane said, “Can you come in for a few minutes? I'd like to have a talk, if you have time.”

“Surely,” Mrs. Winning said courteously, and followed Mrs. MacLane up the walk, still luxuriously bordered with flowering bushes, but somehow disenchanted, as though the summer heat had baked away the vivacity from the ground. In the familiar living-room Mrs. Winning sat down on a straight chair, holding herself politely stiff, while Mrs. MacLane sat as usual in her armchair.

“How is Davey?” Mrs. Winning asked finally, since Mrs. MacLane did not seem disposed to start any conversation.

“He's very well,” Mrs. MacLane said, and smiled as she always did when speaking of Davey. “He's out back with Billy.”

There was a quiet minute, and then Mrs. MacLane said, staring at the blue bowl on the coffee table, “What I wanted to ask you is, what on earth is gone wrong?”

Mrs. Winning had been holding herself stiff in readiness for some such question, and when she said, “I don't know what you mean,” she thought, I sound exactly like Mother Winning, and realized, I'm enjoying this, just as she would; and no matter what she thought of herself she was unable to keep from adding, “Is something wrong?”

“Of course,” Mrs. MacLane said. She stared at the blue bowl, and said slowly, “when I first came, everyone was so nice, and they seemed to like Davey and me and want to help us.”

That's wrong, Mrs. Winning was thinking, you mustn't ever talk about whether people like you, that's bad taste.

“And the garden was going so well,” Mrs. MacLane said helplessly. “And now, no one ever does more than just speak to us—I used to say ‘Good morning’ over the fence to Mrs. Burton and she'd come to the fence and we'd talk about the garden, and now she just says ‘morning’ and goes in the house—and no one ever smiles, or anything.”

This is dreadful, Mrs. Winning thought, this is childish, this is complaining. People treat you as you treat them, she thought; she wanted desperately to go over and take Mrs. MacLane's hand and ask her to come back and be one of the nice people again; but she only sat straighter in the chair and said, “I'm sure you must be mistaken. I've never heard anyone speak of it.”

“Are you sure?” Mrs. MacLane turned and looked at her. “Are you sure it isn't because of Mr. Jones working here?”

Mrs. Winning lifted her chin a little higher and said, “Why on earth would anyone around here be rude to you because of Jones?”

Mrs. MacLane came with her to the door, both of them planning vigorously for the days some time next week, when they would all go swimming, when they would have a picnic, and Mrs. Winning went down the hill thinking, The nerve of her, trying to blame the colored folks.




Toward the end of the summer there was a bad thunderstorm, breaking up the prolonged hot spell. It raged with heavy wind and rain over the town all night, sweeping without pity through the trees, pulling up young bushes and flowers ruthlessly; a barn was struck on one side of town, the wires pulled down on another. In the morning Mrs. Winning opened the back door to find the Winning yard littered with small branches from the maples, the grass bent almost flat to the ground.

Her mother-in-law came to the door behind her. “Quite a storm,” she said, “did it wake you?”

“I woke up once and went to look at the children,” Mrs. Winning said. “It must have been about three o'clock.”

“I was up later,” her mother-in-law said. “I looked at the children too; they were both asleep.”

They turned together and went in to start breakfast.

Later in the day Mrs. Winning started down to the store; she had almost reached the MacLane cottage when she saw Mrs. MacLane standing in the front garden with Mr. Jones standing beside her and Billy Jones with Davey in the shadows of the front porch. They were all looking silently at a great branch from one of the Burtons' trees that lay across the center of the garden, crushing most of the flowering bushes and pinning down what was to have been a glorious tulip bed. As Mrs. Winning stopped, watching, Mrs. Burton came out on to her front porch to survey the storm-damage, and Mrs. MacLane called to her, “Good morning, Mrs. Burton, it looks like we have part of your tree over here.”

“Looks so,” Mrs. Burton said, and she went back into her house and closed the door flatly.

Mrs. Winning watched while Mrs. MacLane stood quietly for a minute. Then she looked up at Mr. Jones almost hopefully and she and Mr. Jones looked at one another for a long time. Then Mrs. MacLane said, her clear voice carrying lightly across the air washed clean by the storm: “Do you think I ought to give it up, Mr. Jones? Go back to the city where I'll never have to see another garden?”

Mr. Jones shook his head despondently, and Mrs. MacLane, her shoulders tired, went slowly over and sat on her front steps and Davey came and sat next to her. Mr. Jones took hold of the great branch angrily and tried to move it, shaking it and pulling until his shoulders tensed with the strength he was bringing to bear, but the branch only gave slightly and stayed, clinging to the garden.

“Leave it alone, Mr. Jones,” Mrs. MacLane said finally. “Leave it for the next people to move!”

But still Mr. Jones pulled against the branch, and then suddenly Davey stood up and cried out, “There's Mrs. Winning! Hi, Mrs. Winning!”

Mrs. MacLane and Mr. Jones both turned, and Mrs. MacLane waved and called out, “Hello!”

Mrs. Winning swung around without speaking and started, with great dignity, back up the hill toward the old Winning house.





The Lottery


The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank, around ten o'clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and had to be started on June 26th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could begin at ten o'clock in the morning and still be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.

The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books and reprimands. Bobby Martin had already stuffed his pockets full of stones, and the other boys soon followed his example, selecting the smoothest and roundest stones; Bobby and Harry Jones and Dickie Delacroix—the villagers pronounced this name “Dellacroy”—eventually made a great pile of stones in one corner of the square and guarded it against the raids of the other boys. The girls stood aside, talking among themselves, looking over their shoulders at the boys, and the very small children rolled in the dust or clung to the hands of their older brothers or sisters.

Soon the men began to gather, surveying their own children, speaking of planting and rain, tractors and taxes. They stood together, away from the pile of stones in the corner, and their jokes were quiet and they smiled rather than laughed. The women, wearing faded house dresses and sweaters, came shortly after their menfolk. They greeted one another and exchanged bits of gossip as they went to join their husbands. Soon the women, standing by their husbands, began to call to their children, and the children came reluctantly, having to be called four or five times. Bobby Martin ducked under his mother's grasping hand and ran, laughing, back to the pile of stones. His father spoke up sharply, and Bobby came quickly and took his place between his father and his oldest brother.

The lottery was conducted—as were the square dances, the teen-age club, the Halloween program—by Mr. Summers, who had time and energy to devote to civic activities. He was a round-faced, jovial man and he ran the coal business, and people were sorry for him, because he had no children and his wife was a scold. When he arrived in the square, carrying the black wooden box, there was a murmur of conversation among the villagers, and he waved and called, “Little late today, folks.” The postmaster, Mr. Graves, followed him, carrying a three-legged stool, and the stool, was put in the center of the square and Mr. Summers set the black box down on it. The villagers kept their distance, leaving a space between themselves and the stool, and when Mr. Summers said, “Some of you fellows want to give me a hand?” there was a hesitation before two men, Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, came forward to hold the box steady on the stool while Mr. Summers stirred up the papers inside it.

The original paraphernalia for the lottery had been lost long ago, and the black box now resting on the stool had been put into use even before Old Man Warner, the oldest man in town, was born. Mr. Summers spoke frequently to the villagers about making a new box, but no one liked to upset even as much tradition as was represented by the black box. There was a story that the present box had been made with some pieces of the box that had preceded it, the one that had been constructed when the first people settled down to make a village here. Every year, after the lottery, Mr. Summers began talking again about a new box, but every year the subject was allowed to fade off without anything's being done. The black box grew shabbier each year; by now it was no longer completely black but splintered badly along one side to show the original wood color, and in some places faded or stained.

Mr. Martin and his oldest son, Baxter, held the black box securely on the stool until Mr. Summers had stirred the papers thoroughly with his hand. Because so much of the ritual had been forgotten or discarded, Mr. Summers had been successful in having slips of paper substituted for the chips of wood that had been used for generations. Chips of wood, Mr. Summers had argued, had been all very well when the village was tiny, but now that the population was more than three hundred and likely to keep on growing, it was necessary to use something that would fit more easily into the black box. The night before the lottery, Mr. Summers and Mr. Graves made up the slips of paper and put them in the box, and it was then taken to the safe of Mr. Summers' coal company and locked up until Mr. Summers was ready to take it to the square next morning. The rest of the year, the box was put away, sometimes one place, sometimes another; it had spent one year in Mr. Graves's barn and another year underfoot in the post office, and sometimes it was set on a shelf in the Martin grocery and left there.

There was a great deal of fussing to be done before Mr. Summers declared the lottery open. There were the lists to make up—of heads of families, heads of households in each family, members of each household in each family. There was the proper swearing-in of Mr. Summers by the postmaster, as the official of the lottery; at one time, some people remembered, there had been a recital of some sort, performed by the official of the lottery, a perfunctory, tuneless chant that had been rattled off duly each year; some people believed that the official of the lottery used to stand just so when he said or sang it, others believed that he was supposed to walk among the people, but years and years ago this part of the ritual had been allowed to lapse. There had been, also, a ritual salute, which the official of the lottery had had to use in addressing each person who came up to draw from the box, but this also had changed with time, until now it was felt necessary only for the official to speak to each person approaching. Mr. Summers was very good at all this; in his clean white shirt and blue jeans, with one hand resting carelessly on the black box, he seemed very proper and important as he talked interminably to Mr. Graves and the Martins.

Just as Mr. Summers finally left off talking and turned to the assembled villagers, Mrs. Hutchinson came hurriedly along the path to the square, her sweater thrown over her shoulders, and slid into place in the back of the crowd. “Clean forgot what day it was,” she said to Mrs. Delacroix, who stood next to her, and they both laughed softly. “Thought my old man was out back stacking wood,” Mrs. Hutchinson went on, “and then I looked out the window and the kids was gone, and then I remembered it was the twenty-seventh and came a-running.” She dried her hands on her apron, and Mrs. Delacroix said, “You're in time, though. They're still talking away up there.”

Mrs. Hutchinson craned her neck to see through the crowd and found her husband and children standing near the front. She tapped Mrs. Delacroix on the arm as a farewell and began to make her way through the crowd. The people separated good-humoredly to let her through; two or three people said, in voices just loud enough to be heard across the crowd, “Here comes your Missus, Hutchinson,” and “Bill, she made it after all.” Mrs. Hutchinson reached her husband, and Mr. Summers, who had been waiting, said cheerfully, “Thought we were going to have to get on without you, Tessie.” Mrs. Hutchinson said, grinning, “Wouldn't have me leave m'dishes in the sink, now, would you, Joe?” and soft laughter ran through the crowd as the people stirred back into position after Mrs. Hutchinson's arrival.

“Well, now,” Mr. Summers said soberly, “guess we better get started, get this over with, so's we can go back to work. Anybody ain't here?”

“Dunbar,” several people said. “Dunbar, Dunbar.”

Mr. Summers consulted his list. “Clyde Dunbar,” he said. “That's right. He's broke his leg, hasn't he? Who's drawing for him?”

“Me, I guess,” a woman said, and Mr. Summers turned to look at her. “Wife draws for her husband,” Mr. Summers said. “Don't you have a grown boy to do it for you, Janey?” Although Mr. Summers and everyone else in the village knew the answer perfectly well, it was the business of the official of the lottery to ask such questions formally. Mr. Summers waited with an expression of polite interest while Mrs. Dunbar answered.

“Horace's not but sixteen yet,” Mrs. Dunbar said regretfully. “Guess I gotta fill in for the old man this year.”

“Right,” Mr. Summers said. He made a note on the list he was holding. Then he asked, “Watson boy drawing this year?”

A tall boy in the crowd raised his hand. “Here,” he said. “I m drawing for m'mother and me.” He blinked his eyes nervously and ducked his head as several voices in the crowd said things like “Good fellow, Jack,” and “Glad to see your mother's got a man to do it.”

“Well,” Mr. Summers said, “guess that's everyone. Old Man Warner make it?”

“Here,” a voice said. and Mr. Summers nodded.




A sudden hush fell on the crowd as Mr. Summers cleared his throat and looked at the list. “All ready?” he called. “Now, I'll read the names—heads of families first—and the men come up and take a paper out of the box. Keep the paper folded in your hand without looking at it until everyone has had a turn. Everything clear?”

The people had done it so many times that they only half listened to the directions; most of them were quiet, wetting their lips, not looking around. Then Mr. Summers raised one hand high and said, “Adams.” A man disengaged himself from the crowd and came forward. “Hi, Steve,” Mr. Summers said, and Mr. Adams said, “Hi, Joe.” They grinned at one another humorlessly and nervously. Then Mr. Adams reached into the black box and took out a folded paper. He held it firmly by one corner as he turned and went hastily back to his place in the crowd, where he stood a little apart from his family, not looking down at his hand.

“Allen,” Mr. Summers said. “Anderson.... Bentham.”

“Seems like there's no time at all between lotteries any more,” Mrs. Delacroix said to Mrs. Graves in the back row. “Seems like we got through with the last one only last week.”

“Time sure goes fast,” Mrs. Graves said.

“Clark.... Delacroix.”

“There goes my old man,” Mrs. Delacroix said. She held her breath while her husband went forward.

“Dunbar,” Mr. Summers said, and Mrs. Dunbar went steadily to the box while one of the women said, “Go on, Janey,” and another said, “There she goes.”

“We're next,” Mrs. Graves said. She watched while Mr. Graves came around from the side of the box, greeted Mr. Summers gravely, and selected a slip of paper from the box. By now, all through the crowd there were men holding the small folded papers in their large hands, turning them over and over nervously. Mrs. Dunbar and her two sons stood together, Mrs. Dunbar holding the slip of paper.

“Harburt.... Hutchinson.”

“Get up there, Bill,” Mrs. Hutchinson said, and the people near her laughed.

“Jones.”

“They do say,” Mr. Adams said to Old Man Warner, who stood next to him, “that over in the north village they're talking of giving up the lottery.”

Old Man Warner snorted. “Pack of crazy fools,” he said. “Listening to the young folks, nothing's good enough for them. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to go back to living in caves, nobody work any more, live that way for a while. Used to be a saying about ‘Lottery in June, corn be heavy soon.’ First thing you know, we'd all be eating stewed chickweed and acorns. There's always been a lottery,” he added petulantly. “Bad enough to see young Joe Summers up there joking with everybody.”

“Some places have already quit lotteries,” Mrs. Adams said.

“Nothing but trouble in that,” Old Man Warner said stoutly. “Pack of young fools.”

“Martin.” And Bobby Martin watched his father go forward. “Overdyke.... Percy.”

“I wish they'd hurry,” Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son. “I wish they'd hurry.”

“They're almost through,” her son said.

“You get ready to run tell Dad,” Mrs. Dunbar said.

Mr. Summers called his own name and then stepped forward precisely and selected a slip from the box. Then he called, “Warner.”

“Seventy-seventh year I been in the lottery,” Old Man Warner said as he went through the crowd. “Seventy-seventh time.”

“Watson.” The tall boy came awkwardly through the crowd. Someone said, “Don't be nervous, Jack,” and Mr. Summers said, “Take your time, son.”

“Zanini.”




After that, there was a long pause, a breathless pause, until Mr. Summers. holding his slip of paper in the air, said, “All right, fellows.” For a minute, no one moved, and then all the slips of paper were opened. Suddenly, all the women began to speak at once, saving, “Who is it?” “Who's got it?” “Is it the Dunbars?” “Is it the Watsons?” Then the voices began to say, “It's Hutchinson. It's Bill,” “Bill Hutchinson's got it.”

“Go tell your father,” Mrs. Dunbar said to her older son.

People began to look around to see the Hutchinsons. Bill Hutchinson was standing quiet, staring down at the paper in his hand. Suddenly, Tessie Hutchinson shouted to Mr. Summers, “You didn't give him time enough to take any paper he wanted. I saw you. It wasn't fair!”

“Be a good sport, Tessie,” Mrs. Delacroix called, and Mrs. Graves said, “All of us took the same chance.”

“Shut up, Tessie,” Bill Hutchinson said.

“Well, everyone,” Mr. Summers said, “that was done pretty fast, and now we've got to be hurrying a little more to get done in time.” He consulted his next list. “Bill,” he said, “you draw for the Hutchinson family. You got any other households in the Hutchinsons?”

“There's Don and Eva,” Mrs. Hutchinson yelled. “Make them take their chance!”

“Daughters draw with their husbands' families, Tessie,” Mr. Summers said gently. “You know that as well as anyone else.”

“It wasn't fair,” Tessie said.

“I guess not, Joe,” Bill Hutchinson said regretfully. “My daughter draws with her husband's family, that's only fair. And I've got no other family except the kids.”

“Then, as far as drawing for families is concerned, it's you,” Mr. Summers said in explanation, “and as far as drawing for households is concerned, that's you, too. Right?”

“Right,” Bill Hutchinson said.

“How many kids, Bill?” Mr. Summers asked formally.

“Three,” Bill Hutchinson said. “There's Bill, Jr., and Nancy, and little Dave. And Tessie and me.”

“All right, then,” Mr. Summers said. “Harry, you got their tickets back?”

Mr. Graves nodded and held up the slips of paper. “Put them in the box, then,” Mr. Summers directed. “Take Bill's and put it in.”

“I think we ought to start over,” Mrs. Hutchinson said, as quietly as she could. “I tell you it wasn't fair. You didn't give him time enough to choose. Everybody saw that.”

Mr. Graves had selected the five slips and put them in the box, and he dropped all the papers but those onto the ground, where the breeze caught them and lifted them off.

“Listen, everybody,” Mrs. Hutchinson was saying to the people around her.

“Ready, Bill?” Mr. Summers asked, and Bill Hutchinson, with one quick glance around at his wife and children, nodded.

“Remember,” Mr. Summers said, “take the slips and keep them folded until each person has taken one. Harry, you help little Dave.” Mr. Graves took the hand of the little boy, who came willingly with him up to the box. “Take a paper out of the box, Davy,” Mr. Summers said. Davy put his hand into the box and laughed. “Take just one paper,” Mr. Summers said. “Harry, you hold it for him.” Mr. Graves took the child's hand and removed the folded paper from the tight fist and held it while little Dave stood next to him and looked up at him wonderingly.

“Nancy next,” Mr. Summers said. Nancy was twelve, and her school friends breathed heavily as she went forward, switching her skirt, and took a slip daintily from the box. “Bill, Jr.,” Mr. Summers said, and Billy, his face red and his feet overlarge, nearly knocked the box over as he got a paper out. “Tessie,” Mr. Summers said. She hesitated for a minute, looking around defiantly, and then set her lips and went up to the box. She snatched a paper out and held it behind her.

“Bill,” Mr. Summers said, and Bill Hutchinson reached into the box and felt around, bringing his hand out at last with the slip of paper in it.

The crowd was quiet. A girl whispered, “I hope it's not Nancy,” and the sound of the whisper reached the edges of the crowd.

“It's not the way it used to be,” Old Man Warner said clearly. “People ain't the way they used to be.”

“All right,” Mr. Summers said. “Open the papers. Harry, you open little Dave's.”

Mr. Graves opened the slip of paper and there was a general sigh through the crowd as he held it up and everyone could see that it was blank. Nancy and Bill, Jr., opened theirs at the same time, and both beamed and laughed, turning around to the crowd and holding their slips of paper above their heads.

“Tessie,” Mr. Summers said. There was a pause, and then Mr. Summers looked at Bill Hutchinson, and Bill unfolded his paper and showed it. It was blank.

“It's Tessie,” Mr. Summers said, and his voice was hushed. “Show us her paper, Bill.”

Bill Hutchinson went over to his wife and forced the slip of paper out of her hand. It had a black spot on it, the black spot Mr. Summers had made the night before with the heavy pencil in the coal-company office. Bill Hutchinson held it up, and there was a stir in the crowd.

“All right, folks,” Mr. Summers said. “Let's finish quickly.”

Although the villagers had forgotten the ritual and lost the original black box, they still remembered to use stones. The pile of stones the boys had made earlier was ready; there were stones on the ground with the blowing scraps of paper that had come out of the box. Mrs. Delacroix selected a stone so large she had to pick it up with both hands and turned to Mrs. Dunbar. “Come on,” she said. “Hurry up.”

Mr. Dunbar had small stones in both hands, and she said, gasping for breath, “I can't run at all. You'll have to go ahead and I'll catch up with you.”

The children had stones already, and someone gave little Davy Hutchinson a few pebbles.

Tessie Hutchinson was in the center of a cleared space by now, and she held her hands out desperately as the villagers moved in on her. “It isn't fair,” she said. A stone hit her on the side of the head.

Old Man Warner was saying, “Come on, come on, everyone.” Steve Adams was in the front of the crowd of villagers, with Mrs. Graves beside him.

“It isn't fair, it isn't right,” Mrs. Hutchinson screamed, and then they were upon her.





Island


Mrs. Montague's son had been very good to her, with the kind affection and attention to her well-being that is seldom found toward mothers in sons with busy wives and growing families of their own; when Mrs. Montague lost her mind, her son came into his natural role of guardian. There had always been a great deal of warm feeling between Mrs. Montague and her son, and although they lived nearly a thousand miles apart by now, Henry Paul Montague was careful to see that his mother was well taken care of; he ascertained, minutely, that the monthly bills for her apartment, her food, her clothes, and her companion were large enough to ensure that Mrs. Montague was getting the best of everything; he wrote to her weekly, tender letters in longhand inquiring about her health; when he came to New York he visited her promptly, and always left an extra check for the companion, to make sure that any small things Mrs. Montague lacked would be given her. The companion, Miss Oakes, had been with Mrs. Montague for six years, and in that time their invariable quiet routine had been broken only by the regular visits from Mrs. Montague's son, and by Miss Oakes's annual six-weeks' leave, during which Mrs. Montague was cared for no less scrupulously by a carefully chosen substitute.

Between such disturbing occasions, Mrs. Montague lived quietly and expensively in her handsome apartment, following with Miss Oakes a life of placid regularity, which it required all of Miss Oakes's competence to engineer, and duly reported on to Mrs. Montague's son. “I do think we're very lucky, dear,” was Miss Oakes's frequent comment, “to have a good son like Mr. Montague to take care of us so well.”

To which Mrs. Montague's usual answer was, “Henry Paul was a good boy.”

Mrs. Montague usually spent the morning in bed, and got up for lunch; after the effort of bathing and dressing and eating she was ready for another rest and then her walk, which occurred regularly at four o'clock, and which was followed by dinner sent up from the restaurant downstairs, and, shortly after, by Mrs. Montague's bedtime. Although Miss Oakes did not leave the apartment except in an emergency, she had a great deal of time to herself and her regular duties were not harsh, although Mrs. Montague was not the best company in the world. Frequently Miss Oakes would look up from her magazine to find Mrs. Montague watching her curiously; sometimes Mrs. Montague, in a spirit of petulant stubbornness, would decline all food under any persuasion until it was necessary for Miss Oakes to call in Mrs. Montague's doctor for Mrs. Montague to hear a firm lecture on her duties as a patient. Once Mrs. Montague had tried to run away, and had been recaptured by Miss Oakes in the street in front of the apartment house, going vaguely through the traffic; and always, constantly, Mrs. Montague was trying to give things to Miss Oakes, many of which, in absolute frankness, it cost Miss Oakes a pang to refuse.

Miss Oakes had not been born to the luxury which Mrs. Montague had known all her life; Miss Oakes had worked hard and never had a fur coat; no matter how much she tried Miss Oakes could not disguise the fact that she relished the food sent up from the restaurant downstairs, delicately cooked and prettily served; Miss Oakes was persuaded that she disdained jewelry, and she chose her clothes hurriedly and inexpensively, under the eye of an impatient, badly dressed salesgirl in a department store. No matter how agonizingly Miss Oakes debated under the insinuating lights of the budget dress department, the clothes she carried home with her turned out to be garish reds and yellows in the daylight, inexactly striped or dotted, badly cut. Miss Oakes sometimes thought longingly of the security of her white uniforms, nearly stacked in her dresser drawer, but Mrs. Montague was apt to go into a tantrum at any outward show of Miss Oakes's professional competence, and Miss Oakes dined nightly on the agreeable food from the restaurant downstairs in her red and yellow dresses, with her colorless hair drawn ungracefully to a bun in back, her ringless hands moving appreciatively among the plates. Mrs. Montague, who ordinarily spilled food all over herself, chose her dresses from a selection sent every three or four months from an exclusive dress shop near by; all information as to size and color was predigested in the shop, and the soft-voiced saleslady brought only dresses absolutely right for Mrs. Montague. Mrs. Montague usually chose two dresses each time, and they went, neatly hung on sacheted hangers, to live softly in Mrs. Montague's closet along with other dresses just like them, all in soft blues and grays and mauves.

“We must try to be more careful of our pretty clothes,” Miss Oakes would say, looking up from her dinner to find Mrs. Montague, almost deliberately, it seemed sometimes, emptying her spoonful of oatmeal down the front of her dress. “Dear, we really must try to be more careful; remember what our nice son has to pay for those dresses.”

Mrs. Montague stared vaguely sometimes, holding her spoon; sometimes she said, “I want my pudding now; I'll be careful with my pudding.” Now and then, usually when the day had gone badly and Mrs. Montague was overtired, or cross for one reason or another, she might turn the dish of oatmeal over onto the tablecloth, and then, frequently, Miss Oakes was angry, and Mrs. Montague was deprived of her pudding and sat blankly while Miss Oakes moved her own dishes to a coffee table and called the waiter to remove the dinner table with its mess of oatmeal.

It was in the late spring that Mrs. Montague was usually at her worst; then, for some reason, it seemed that the stirring of green life, even under the dirty city traffic, communicated a restlessness and longing to her that she felt only spasmodically the rest of the year; around April or May, Miss Oakes began to prepare for trouble, for runnings-away and supreme oatmeal overturnings. In summer, Mrs. Montague seemed happier, because it was possible to walk in the park and feed the squirrels; in the fall, she quieted, in preparation for the long winter when she was almost dormant, like an animal, rarely speaking, and suffering herself to be dressed and undressed without rebellion; it was the winter that Miss Oakes most appreciated, although as the months moved on into spring Miss Oakes began to think more often of giving up her position, her pleasant salary, the odorous meals from the restaurant downstairs.

It was in the spring that Mrs. Montague so often tried to give things to Miss Oakes; one afternoon when their walk was dubious because of the rain, Mrs. Montague had gone as of habit to the hall closet and taken out her coat, and now sat in her armchair with the rich dark mink heaped in her lap, smoothing the fur as though she held a cat. “Pretty,” Mrs. Montague was saying, “pretty, pretty.”

“We're very lucky to have such lovely things,” Miss Oakes said. Because it was her practice to keep busy always, never to let her knowledgeable fingers rest so long as they might be doing something useful, she was knitting a scarf. It was only half-finished, but already Miss Oakes was beginning to despair of it; the yarn, in the store and in the roll, seemed a soft tender green, but knit up into the scarf it assumed a gaudy chartreuse character that made its original purpose—to embrace the firm fleshy neck of Henry Paul Montague—seem faintly improper; when Miss Oakes looked at the scarf impartially it irritated her, as did almost everything she created.

“Think of the money,” Miss Oakes said, “that goes into all those beautiful things, just because your son is so generous and kind.”

“I will give you this fur,” Mrs. Montague said suddenly. “Because you have no beautiful things of your own.”

“Thank you, dear,” Miss Oakes said. She worked busily at her scarf for a minute and then said, “It's not being very grateful for nice things like that, dear, to want to give them away.”

“It wouldn't look nice on you,” Mrs. Montague said, “it would look awful. You're not very pretty.”

Miss Oakes was silent again for a minute, and then she said, “Well, dear, shall we see if it's still raining?” With great deliberation she put down the knitting and walked over to the window. When she pulled back the lace curtain and the heavy dark-red drape she did so carefully, because the curtain and the drape were not precisely her own, but were of service to her, and pleasant to her touch, and expensive. “It's almost stopped,” she said brightly. She squinted her eyes and looked up at the sky. “I do believe it's going to clear up,” she went on, as though her brightness might create a sun of reflected brilliance. “In about fifteen minutes...” She let her voice trail off, and smiled at Mrs. Montague with vast anticipation.

“I don't want to go for any walk,” Mrs. Montague said sullenly. “Once when we were children we used to take off all our clothes and run out in the rain.”

Miss Oakes returned to her chair and took up her knitting. “We can start to get ready in a few minutes,” she promised.

“I couldn't do that now, of course,” Mrs. Montague said. “I want to color.”

She slid out of her chair, dropping the mink coat into a heap on the floor, and went slowly, with her faltering walk, across the room to the card table where her coloring book and box of crayons lay. Miss Oakes sighed, set her knitting down, and walked over to pick up the mink coat; she draped it tenderly over the back of the chair, and went back and picked up her knitting again.

“Pretty, pretty,” Mrs. Montague crooned over her coloring, “Pretty blue, pretty water, pretty, pretty.”

Miss Oakes allowed a small smile to touch her face as she regarded the scarf; it was a bright color, perhaps too bright for a man no longer very young, but it was gay and not really unusually green. His birthday was three weeks off; the card in the box would say “To remind you of your loyal friend and admirer, Polly Oakes.” Miss Oakes sighed quickly.

“I want to go for a walk,” Mrs. Montague said abruptly.

“Just a minute, dear,” Miss Oakes said. She put the knitting down again and smiled at Mrs. Montague. “I'll help you,” Miss Oakes said, and went over to assist Mrs. Montague in the slow task that getting out of a straight chair always entailed. “Why, look at you,” Miss Oakes said, regarding the coloring book over Mrs. Montague's head. She laughed. “You've gone and made the whole thing blue, you silly child.” She turned back a page. “And here,” she said, and laughed again. “Why does the man have a blue face? And the little girl in the picture—she mustn't be blue, dear, her face should be pink and her hair should be—oh, yellow, for instance. Not blue.”

Mrs. Montague put her hands violently over the picture. “Mine,” she said. “Get away, this is mine.”

“I'm sorry,” Miss Oakes said smoothly, “I wasn't laughing at you, dear. It was just funny to see a man with a blue face.” She helped Mrs. Montague out of the chair and escorted her across the room to the mink coat. Mrs. Montague stood stiffly while Miss Oakes put the coat over her shoulders and helped her arms into the sleeves, and when Miss Oakes came around in front of her to button the coat at the neck Mrs. Montague turned down the corners of her mouth and said sullenly into Miss Oakes's face, so close to hers, “You don't know what things are, really.”

“Perhaps I don't,” Miss Oakes said absently. She surveyed Mrs. Montague, neatly buttoned into the mink coat, and then took Mrs. Montague's rose-covered hat from the table in the hall and set it on Mrs. Montague's head, with great regard to the correct angle and the neatness of the roses. “Now we look so pretty,” Miss Oakes said. Mrs. Montague stood silently while Miss Oakes went to the hall closet and took out her own serviceable blue coat. She shrugged herself into it, settled it with a brisk tug at the collar, and pulled on her hat with a quick gesture from back to front that landed the hatbrim at exactly the usual angle over her eye. It was not until she was escorting Mrs. Montague to the door that Miss Oakes gave one brief, furtive glance at the hall mirror, as one who does so from a nervous compulsion rather than any real desire for information.

Miss Oakes enjoyed walking down the hall; its carpets were so thick that even the stout shoes of Miss Oakes made no sound. The elevator was self-service, and Miss Oakes, with superhuman control, allowed it to sweep soundlessly down to the main floor, carrying with it Miss Oakes herself, and Mrs. Montague, who sat docilely on the velvet-covered bench and stared at the paneling as though she had never seen it before. When the elevator door opened and they moved out into the lobby Miss Oakes knew that the few people who saw them—the girl at the switchboatd, the doorman, another tenant coming to the elevator—recognized Mrs. Montague as the rich old lady who lived high upstairs, and Miss Oakes as the infinitely competent companion, without whose unswerving assistance Mrs. Montague could not live for ten minutes. Miss Oakes walked sturdily and well through the lobby, her firm hand guiding soft little Mrs. Montague; the lobby floor was pale carpeting on which their feet made no sound, and the lobby walls were painted an expensive color so neutral as to be almost invisible; as Miss Oakes went with Mrs. Montague through the lobby it was as though they walked upon clouds, through the noncommittal areas of infinite space. The doorway was their aim, and the doorman, dressed in gray, opened the way for them with a flourish and a “Good afternoon” which began by being directed at Mrs. Montague, as the employer, and ended by addressing Miss Oakes, as the person who would be expected to answer.

“Good afternoon, George,” Miss Oakes said, with a stately smile, and passed on through the doorway, leading Mrs. Montague. Once outside on the sidewalk, Miss Oakes steered Mrs. Montague quickly to the left, since, allowed her head, Mrs. Montague might as easily have turned unexpectedly to the right, although they always turned to the left, and so upset Miss Oakes's walk for the day. With slow steps they moved into the current of people walking up the street, Miss Oakes watching ahead to avoid Mrs. Montague's walking into strangers, Mrs. Montague with her face turned up to the gray sky.

“It's a lovely day,” Miss Oakes said. “Pleasantly cool after the rain.”

They had gone perhaps half a block when Mrs. Montague, by a gentle pressure against Miss Oakes's arm, began to direct them toward the inside of the sidewalk and the shop windows; Miss Oakes, resisting at first, at last allowed herself to be reluctantly influenced and they crossed the sidewalk to stand in front of the window to a stationery store.

They stopped here every day, and, as she said every day, Mrs. Montague murmured softly, “Look at all the lovely things.” She watched with amusement a plastic bird, colored bright red and yellow, which methodically dipped its beak into a glass of water and withdrew it; while they stood watching the bird lowered its head and touched the water, hesitated, and then rose.

“Does it stop when we're not here?” Mrs. Montague asked, and Miss Oakes laughed, and said, “It never stops. It goes on while we're eating and while we're sleeping and all the time.”

Mrs. Montague's attention had wandered to the open pages of a diary, spread nakedly to the pages dated June 14-June 15. Mrs. Montague, looking at the smooth unwritten paper, caught her breath. “I'd like to have that,” she said, and Miss Oakes, as she answered every day, said, “What would you write in it, dear?”

The thing that always caught Mrs. Montague next was a softly curved blue bowl which stood in the center of the window display; Mrs. Montague pored lovingly and speechlessly over this daily, trying to touch it through the glass of the window.

“Come on dear,” Miss Oakes said finally, with an almost-impatient tug at Mrs. Montague's arm. “We'll never get our walk finished if you don't come on.”

Docilely Mrs. Montague followed. “Pretty,” she whispered, “pretty, pretty.”




She opened her eyes suddenly and was aware that she saw. The sky was unbelievably, steadily blue, and the sand beneath her feet was hot; she could see the water, colored more deeply than the sky, but faintly greener. Far off was the line where the sky and water met, and it was infinitely pure.

“Pretty,” she said inadequately, and was aware that she spoke. She was walking on the sand, and with a sudden impatient gesture she stopped and slipped off her shoes, standing first on one foot and then on the other. This encouraged her to look down at herself; she was very tall, high above her shoes on the sand, and when she moved it was freely and easily except for the cumbering clothes, the heavy coat and the hat, which sat on her head with a tangible, oppressive weight. She threw the hat onto the hot lovely sand, and it looked so offensive, lying with its patently unreal roses against the smooth clarity of the sand, that she bent quickly and covered the hat with handfuls of sand; the coat was more difficult to cover, and the sand ran delicately between the hairs of the short dark fur; before she had half covered the coat she decided to put the rest of her clothes with it, and did so, slipping easily out of the straps and buttons and catches of many garments, which she remembered as difficult to put on. When all her clothes were buried she looked with satisfaction down at her strong white legs, and thought, aware that she was thinking it: they are almost the same color as the sand. She began to run freely, with the blue ocean and the bluer sky on her right, the trees on her left, and the moving sand underfoot; she ran until she came back to the place where a corner of her coat still showed through the sand. When she saw it she stopped again and said, “Pretty, pretty,” and leaned over and took a handful of sand and let it run through her fingers.

Far away, somewhere in the grove of trees that centered the island she could hear the parrot calling. “Eat, eat,” it shrieked, and then something indistinguishable, and then, “Eat, eat.”

An idea came indirectly and subtly to her mind; it was the idea of food, for a minute unpleasant and as though it meant a disagreeable sensation, and then glowingly happy. She turned and ran—it was impossible to move slowly on the island, with the clear hot air all around her, and the ocean stirring constantly, pushing at the island, and the unbelievable blue sky above—and when she came into the sudden warm shade of the trees she ran from one to another, putting her hand for a minute on each.

“Hello,” the parrot gabbled, “Hello, who's there, eat?” She could see it flashing among the trees, no more than a sawtoothed voice and a flash of ugly red and yellow.

The grass was green and rich and soft, and she sat down by the little brook where the food was set out. Today there was a great polished wooden bowl, soft to the touch, full of purple grapes; the sun that came unevenly between the trees struck a high shine from the bowl, and lay flatly against the grapes, which were dusty with warmth, and almost black. There was a shimmering glass just full of dark red wine; there was a flat blue plate filled with little cakes; she touched one and it was full of cream, and heavily iced with soft chocolate. There were pomegranates, and cheese, and small, sharp-flavored candies. She lay down beside the food, and closed her eyes against the heavy scent from the grapes.

“Eat, eat,” the parrot screamed from somewhere over her head. She opened her eyes lazily and looked up, to see the flash of red and yellow in the trees. “Be still, you noisy beast,” she said, and smiled to herself because it was not important, actually, whether the parrot were quiet or not. Later, after she had slept, she ate some of the grapes and the cheese, and several of the rich little cakes. While she ate the parrot came cautiously closer, begging for food, sidling up near to the dish of cakes and then moving quickly away.

“Beast,” she said pleasantly to the parrot, “greedy beast.”

When she was sure she was quite through with the food, she put one of the cakes on a green leaf and set it a little bit away from her for the parrot. It came up to the cake slowly and fearfully, watching on either side for some sudden prohibitive movement; when it finally reached the cake it hesitated, and then dipped its head down to bury its beak in the soft frosting; it lifted its head, paused to look around, and then lowered its beak to the cake again. The gesture was familiar, and she laughed, not knowing why.

She was faintly aware that she had slept again, and awakened wanting to run, to go out into the hot sand on the beach and run shouting around the island. The parrot was gone, its cake a mess of crumbs and frosting on the ground. She ran out onto the beach, and the water was there, and the sky. For a few minutes she ran, going down to the water and then swiftly back before it could touch her bare feet, and then she dropped luxuriously onto the sand and lay there. After a while she began to draw a picture in the sand; it was a round face with dots for eyes and nose and a line for a mouth. “Henry Paul,” she said, touching the face caressingly with her fingers, and then, laughing, she leaped to her feet and began to run again, around the island. When she passed the face drawn on the sand she put one bare foot on it and ground it away. “Eat, eat,” she could hear the parrot calling from the trees; the parrot was afraid of the hot sand and the water and stayed always in the trees near the food. Far off, across the water, she could see the sweet, the always comforting, line of the horizon.

When she was tired with running she lay down again on the sand. For a little while she played idly, writing words on the sand and then rubbing them out with her hand; once she drew a crude picture of a doorway and punched her fist through it.

Finally she lay down and put her face down to the sand. It was hot, hotter than anything else had ever been, and the soft grits of the sand slipped into her mouth, where she could taste them, deliciously hard and grainy against her teeth; they were in her eyes, rich and warm; the sand was covering her face and the blue sky was gone from above her and the sand was cooler, then grayer, covering her face, and cold.

“Nearly home,” Miss Oakes said brightly, as they turned the last corner of their block. “It's been a nice walk, hasn't it?”

She tried, unsuccessfully, to guide Mrs. Montague quickly past the bakery, but Mrs. Montague's feet, moving against Miss Oakes's pressure from habit, brought them up to stand in front of the bakery window.

“I don't know why they leave those fly-specked élairs out here,” Miss Oakes said irritably. “There's nothing less appetizing. Look at that cake; the cream is positively curdled.”

She moved her arm insinuatingly within Mrs. Montague's; “In a few minutes we'll be home,” she said softly, “and then we can have our nice cocktail, and rest for a few minutes, and then dinner.”

“Pretty,” Mrs. Montague said at the cakes. “I want some.”

Miss Oakes shuddered violently. “Don't even say it,” she implored. “Just look at that stuff. You'd be sick for a week.”

She moved Mrs. Montague along, and they came, moving quicker than they had when they started, back to their own doorway where the doorman in gray waited for them. He opened the door and said, beginning with Mrs. Montague and finishing with Miss Oakes, “Have a nice walk?”

“Very pleasant, thank you,” Miss Oakes said agreeably. They passed through the doorway and into the lobby where the open doors of the elevator waited for them. “Dinner soon,” Miss Oakes said as they went across the lobby.

Miss Oakes was careful, on their own floor, to see that Mrs. Montague found the right doorway; while Miss Oakes put the key in the door Mrs. Montague stood waiting without expression.

Mrs. Montague moved forward automatically when the door was opened, and Miss Oakes caught her arm, saying shrilly, “Don't step on it!” Mrs. Montague stopped, and waited, while Miss Oakes picked up the dinner menu from the floor just inside the door; it had been slipped under the door while they were out.

Once inside, Miss Oakes removed Mrs. Montague's rosy hat and the mink coat, and Mrs. Montague took the mink coat in her arms and sat down in her chair with it, smoothing the fur. Miss Oakes slid out of her own coat and hung it neatly in the closet, and then came into the living room, carrying the dinner menu.

“Chicken liver omelette,” Miss Oakes read as she walked. “The last time it was a trifle underdone; I could mention it, of course, but they never seem to pay much attention. Roast turkey. Filet mignon. I really do think a nice little piece of...” she looked up at Mrs. Montague and smiled. “Hungry?” she suggested.

“No,” Mrs. Montague said. “I've had enough.”

“Nice oatmeal?” Miss Oakes said. “If you're very good you can have ice cream tonight.”

“Don't want ice cream,” Mrs. Montague said.

Miss Oakes sighed, and then said “Well...” placatingly. She returned to the menu. “French-fried potatoes,” she said. “They're very heavy on the stomach, but I do have my heart set on a nice little piece of steak and some french-fried potatoes. It sounds just right tonight.”

“Shall I give you this coat?” Mrs. Montague asked suddenly.

Miss Oakes stopped on her way to the phone and patted Mrs. Montague lightly on the shoulder. “You're very generous, dear,” she said, “but of course you don't really want to give me your beautiful coat. What would your dear son say?”

Mrs. Montague ran her hand over the fur of the coat affectionately. Then she stood up, slowly, and the coat slid to the floor.

“I'm going to color,” she announced.

Miss Oakes turned back from the phone to pick up the coat and put it over the back of the chair. “All right,” she said. She went to the phone, sat so she could keep an eye on Mrs. Montague while she talked, and said into the phone “Room service.”

Mrs. Montague moved across the room and sat down at the card table. Reflectively she turned the pages of the coloring book, found a picture that pleased her, and opened the crayon box. Miss Oakes hummed softly into the phone. “Room service?” she said finally. “I want to order dinner sent up to Mrs. Montague's suite, please.” She looked over the phone at Mrs. Montague and said, “You all right, dear?”

Without turning, Mrs. Montague moved her shoulders impatiently, and selected a crayon from the box. She examined the point of it with great care while Miss Oakes said, “I want one very sweet martini, please. And Mrs. Montague's prune juice.” She picked up the menu and wet her lips, then said, “One crab-meat cocktail. And tonight will you see that Mrs. Montague has milk with her oatmeal; you sent cream last night. Yes, milk, please. You'd think they'd know by now,” she added to Mrs. Montague over the top of the phone. “Now let me see,” she said, into the phone again, her eyes on the menu.

Disregarding Miss Oakes, Mrs. Montague had begun to color. Her shoulders bent low over the book, a vague smile on her old face, she was devoting herself to a picture of a farmyard; a hen and three chickens strutted across the foreground of the picture, a barn surrounded by trees was the background. Mrs. Montague had laboriously colored the hen and the three chickens, the barn and the trees a rich blue, and now, with alternate touches of the crayons, was engaged in putting a red and yellow blot far up in the blue trees.





The Summer People


The Allisons' country cottage, seven miles from the nearest town, was set prettily on a hill; from three sides it looked down on soft trees and grass that seldom, even at midsummer, lay still and dry. On the fourth side was the lake, which touched against the wooden pier the Allisons had to keep repairing, and which looked equally well from the Allisons' front porch, their side porch or any spot on the wooden staircase leading from the porch down to the water. Although the Allisons loved their summer cottage, looked forward to arriving in the early summer and hated to leave in the fall, they had not troubled themselves to put in any improvements, regarding the cottage itself and the lake as improvement enough for the life left to them. The cottage had no heat, no running water except the precarious supply from the backyard pump and no electricity. For seventeen summers, Janet Allison had cooked on a kerosene stove, heating all their water; Robert Allison had brought buckets full of water daily from the pump and read his paper by kerosene light in the evenings; and they had both, sanitary city people, become stolid and matter-of-fact about their backhouse. In the first two years they had gone through all the standard vaudeville and magazine jokes about backhouses and by now, when they no longer had frequent guests to impress, they had subsided to a comfortable security which made the backhouse, as well as the pump and the kerosene, an indefinable asset to their summer life.

In themselves, the Allisons were ordinary people. Mrs. Allison was fifty-eight years old and Mr. Allison sixty; they had seen their children outgrow the summer cottage and go on to families of their own and seashore resorts; their friends were either dead or settled in comfortable year-round houses, their nieces and nephews vague. In the winter they told one another they could stand their New York apartment while waiting for the summer; in the summer they told one another that the winter was well worth while, waiting to get to the country.

Since they were old enough not to be ashamed of regular habits, the Allisons invariably left their summer cottage the Tuesday after Labor Day, and were as invariably sorry when the months of September and early October turned out to be pleasant and almost insufferably barren in the city; each year they recognized that there was nothing to bring them back to New York, but it was not until this year that they overcame their traditional inertia enough to decide to stay in the cottage after Labor Day.

“There isn't really anything to take us back to the city,” Mrs. Allison told her husband seriously, as though it were a new idea, and he told her, as though neither of them had ever considered it, “We might as well enjoy the country as long as possible.”

Consequently, with much pleasure and a slight feeling of adventure, Mrs. Allison went into their village the day after Labor Day and told those natives with whom she had dealings, with a pretty air of breaking away from tradition, that she and her husband had decided to stay at least a month longer at their cottage.

“It isn't as though we had anything to take us back to the city,” she said to Mr. Babcock, her grocer. “We might as well enjoy the country while we can.”

“Nobody ever stayed at the lake past Labor Day before,” Mr. Babcock said. He was putting Mrs. Allison's groceries into a large cardboard carton, and he stopped for a minute to look reflectively into a bag of cookies. “Nobody,” he added.

“But the city!” Mrs. Allison always spoke of the city to Mr. Babcock as though it were Mr. Babcock's dream to go there. “It's so hot—you've really no idea. We're always sorry when we leave.”

“Hate to leave,” Mr. Babcock said. One of the most irritating native tricks Mrs. Allison had noticed was that of taking a trivial statement and rephrasing it downwards, into an even more trite statement. “I'd hate to leave myself,” Mr. Babcock said, after deliberation, and both he and Mrs. Allison smiled. “But I never heard of anyone ever staying out at the lake after Labor Day before.”

“Well, we're going to give it a try,” Mrs. Allison said, and Mr. Babcock replied gravely, “Never know till you try.”

Physically, Mrs. Allison decided, as she always did when leaving the grocery after one of her inconclusive conversations with Mr. Babcock, physically, Mr. Babcock could model for a statue of Daniel Webster, but mentally... it was horrible to think into what old New England Yankee stock had degenerated. She said as much to Mr. Allison when she got into the car, and he said, “It's generations of inbreeding. That and the bad land.”

Since this was their big trip into town, which they made only once every two weeks to buy things they could not have delivered, they spent all day at it, stopping to have a sandwich in the newspaper and soda shop, and leaving packages heaped in the back of the car. Although Mrs. Allison was able to order groceries delivered regularly, she was never able to form any accurate idea of Mr. Babcock's current stock by telephone, and her lists of odds and ends that might be procured was always supplemented, almost beyond their need, by the new and fresh local vegetables Mr. Babcock was selling temporarily, or the packaged candy which had just come in. This trip Mrs. Allison was tempted, too, by the set of glass baking dishes that had found themselves completely by chance in the hardware and clothing and general store, and which had seemingly been waiting there for no one but Mrs. Allison, since the country people, with their instinctive distrust of anything that did not look as permanent as trees and rocks and sky, had only recently begun to experiment in aluminum baking dishes instead of ironware, and had, apparently within the memory of local inhabitants, discarded stoneware in favor of iron.

Mrs. Allison had the glass baking dishes carefully wrapped, to endure the uncomfortable ride home over the rocky road that led up to the Allisons' cottage, and while Mr. Charley Walpole, who, with his younger brother Albert, ran the hardware-clothing-general store (the store itself was called Johnson's, because it stood on the site of the old Johnson cabin, burned fifty years before Charley Walpole was born), laboriously unfolded newspapers to wrap around the dishes, Mrs. Allison said, informally, “Course, I could have waited and gotten those dishes in New York, but we're not going back so soon this year.”

“Heard you was staying on,” Mr. Charley Walpole said. His old fingers fumbled maddeningly with the thin sheets of newspaper, carefully trying to isolate only one sheet at a time, and he did not look up at Mrs. Allison as he went on, “Don't know about staying on up there to the lake. Not after Labor Day.”

“Well, you know,” Mrs. Allison said, quite as though he deserved an explanation, “it just seemed to us that we've been hurrying back to New York every year, and there just wasn't any need for it. You know what the city's like in the fall.” And she smiled confidingly up at Mr. Charley Walpole.

Rythmically he wound string around the package. He's giving me a piece long enough to save, Mrs. Allison thought, and she looked away quickly to avoid giving any sign of impatience. “I feel sort of like we belong here, more,” she said. “Staying on after everyone else has left.” To prove this, she smiled brightly across the store at a woman with a familiar face, who might have been the woman who sold berries to the Allisons one year, or the woman who occasionally helped in the grocery and was probably Mr. Babcock's aunt.

“Well,” Mr. Charley Walpole said. He shoved the package a little across the counter, to show that it was finished and that for a sale well made, a package well wrapped, he was willing to accept pay. “Well,” he said again. “Never been summer people before, at the lake after Labor Day.”

Mrs. Allison gave him a five-dollar bill, and he made change methodically, giving great weight even to the pennies. “Never after Labor Day,” he said, and nodded at Mrs. Allison, and went soberly along the store to deal with two women who were looking at cotton house dresses.

As Mrs. Allison passed on her way out she heard one of the women say acutely, “Why is one of them dresses one dollar and thirty-nine cents and this one here is only ninety-eight?”

“They're great people,” Mrs. Allison told her husband as they went together down the sidewalk after meeting at the door of the hardware store. “They're so solid, and so reasonable, and so honest.”

“Makes you feel good, knowing there are still towns like this,” Mr. Allison said.

“You know, in New York,” Mrs. Allison said, “I might have paid a few cents less for these dishes, but there wouldn't have been anything, sort of personal in the transaction.”

“Staying on to the lake?” Mrs. Martin, in the newspaper and sandwich shop, asked the Allisons. “Heard you was staying on.”

“Thought we'd take advantage of the lovely weather this year,” Mr. Allison said.

Mrs. Martin was a comparative newcomer to the town; she had married into the newspaper and sandwich shop from a neighboring farm, and had stayed on after her husband's death. She served bottled soft drinks, and fried egg and onion sandwiches on thick bread, which she made on her own stove at the back of the store. Occasionally when Mrs. Martin served a sandwich it would carry with it the rich fragrance of the stew or the pork chops cooking alongside for Mrs. Martin's dinner.

“I don't guess anyone's ever stayed out there so long before,” Mrs. Martin said. “Not after Labor Day, anyway.”

“I guess Labor Day is when they usually leave,” Mr. Hall, the Allisons' nearest neighbor, told them later, in front of Mr. Babcock's store, where the Allisons were getting into their car to go home. “Surprised you're staying on.”

“It seemed a shame to go so soon,” Mrs. Allison said. Mr. Hall lived three miles away; he supplied the Allisons with butter and eggs, and occasionally, from the top of their hill, the Allisons could see the lights in his house in the early evening before the Halls went to bed.

“They usually leave Labor Day,” Mr. Hall said.

The ride home was long and rough; it was beginning to get dark, and Mr. Allison had to drive very carefully over the dirt road by the lake. Mrs. Allison lay back against the seat, pleasantly relaxed after a day of what seemed whirlwind shopping compared with their day-to-day existence; the new glass baking dishes lurked agreeably in her mind, and the half bushel of red eating apples, and the package of colored thumbtacks with which she was going to put up new shelf edging in the kitchen. “Good to get home,” she said softly as they came in sight of their cottage, silhouetted above them against the sky.

“Glad we decided to stay on,” Mr. Allison agreed.

Mrs. Allison spent the next morning lovingly washing her baking dishes, although in his innocence Charley Walpole had neglected to notice the chip in the edge of one; she decided, wastefully, to use some of the red eating apples in a pie for dinner, and, while the pie was in the oven and Mr. Allison was down getting the mail, she sat out on the little lawn the Allisons had made at the top of the hill, and watched the changing lights on the lake, alternating gray and blue as clouds moved quickly across the sun.

Mr. Allison came back a little out of sorts; it always irritated him to walk the mile to the mailbox on the state road and come back with nothing, even though he assumed that the walk was good for his health. This morning there was nothing but a circular from a New York department store, and their New York paper, which arrived erratically by mail from one to four days later than it should, so that some days the Allisons might have three papers and frequently none. Mrs. Allison, although she shared with her husband the annoyance of not having mail when they so anticipated it, pored affectionately over the department store circular, and made a mental note to drop in at the store when she finally went back to New York, and check on the sale of wool blankets; it was hard to find good ones in pretty colors nowadays. She debated saving the circular to remind herself, but after thinking about getting up and getting into the cottage to put it away safely somewhere, she dropped it into the grass beside her chair and lay back, her eyes half closed.

“Looks like we might have some rain,” Mr. Allison said, squinting at the sky.

“Good for the crops,” Mrs. Allison said laconically, and they both laughed.

The kerosene man came the next morning while Mr. Allison was down getting the mail; they were getting low on kerosene and Mrs. Allison greeted the man warmly; he sold kerosene and ice, and, during the summer, hauled garbage away for the summer people. A garbage man was only necessary for improvident city folk; country people had no garbage.

“I'm glad to see you,” Mrs. Allison told him. “We were getting pretty low.”

The kerosene man, whose name Mrs. Allison had never learned, used a hose attachment to fill the twenty-gallon tank which supplied light and heat and cooking facilities for the Allisons; but today, instead of swinging down from his truck and unhooking the hose from where it coiled affectionately around the cab of the truck, the man stared uncomfortably at Mrs. Allison, his truck motor still going.

“Thought you folks'd be leaving,” he said.

“We're staying on another month,” Mrs. Allison said brightly. “The weather was so nice, and it seemed like—”

“That's what they told me,” the man said. “Can't give you no oil, though.”

“What do you mean?” Mrs. Allison raised her eyebrows. “We're just going to keep on with our regular—”

“After Labor Day,” the man said. “I don't get so much oil myself after Labor Day.”

Mrs. Allison reminded herself, as she had frequently to do when in disagreement with her neighbors, that city manners were no good with country people; you could not expect to overrule a country employee as you could a city worker, an Mrs. Allison smiled engagingly as she said, “But can't you get extra oil, at least while we stay?”

“You see,” the man said. He tapped his finger exasperatingly against the car wheel as he spoke. “You see,” he said slowly, “I order this oil. I order it down from maybe fifty, fifty-five mile away. I order back in June, how much I'll need for the summer. Then I order again... oh, about November. Round about now it's starting to get pretty short.” As though the subject were closed, he stopped tapping his finger and tightened his hands on the wheel in preparation for departure.

“But can't you give us some?” Mrs. Allison said. “Isn't there anyone else?”

“Don't know as you could get oil anywheres else right now,” the man said consideringly. “I can't give you none.” Before Mrs. Allison could speak, the truck began to move; then it stopped for a minute and he looked at her through the back window of the cab. “Ice?” he called. “I could let you have some ice.”

Mrs. Allison shook her head; they were not terribly low on ice, and she was angry. She ran a few steps to catch up with the truck, calling, “Will you try to get us some? Next week?”

“Don't see's I can,” the man said. “After Labor Day, it's harder.” The truck drove away, and Mrs. Allison, only comforted by the thought that she could probably get kerosene from Mr. Babcock, or, at worst, the Halls, watched it go with anger. “Next summer,” she told herself. “Just let him try coming around next summer!”

There was no mail again, only the paper, which seemed to be coming doggedly on time, and Mr. Allison was openly cross when he returned. When Mrs. Allison told him about the kerosene man he was not particularly impressed.

“Probably keeping it all for a high price during the winter,” he commented. “What's happened to Anne and Jerry, do you think?”

Anne and Jerry were their son and daughter, both married, one living in Chicago, one in the Far West; their dutiful weekly letters were late; so late, in fact, that Mr. Allison's annoyance at the lack of mail was able to settle on a legitimate grievance. “Ought to realize how we wait for their letters,” he said. “Thoughtless, selfish children. Ought to know better.”

“Well, dear,” Mrs. Allison said placatingly. Anger at Anne and Jerry would not relieve her emotions toward the kerosene man. After a few minutes she said, “Wishing won't bring the mail, dear. I'm going to go call Mr. Babcock and tell him to send up some kerosene with my order.”

“At least a postcard,” Mr. Allison said as she left.




As with most of the cottage's inconveniences, the Allisons no longer noticed the phone particularly, but yielded to its eccentricities without conscious complaint. It was a wall phone, of a type still seen in only few communities; in order to get the operator, Mrs. Allison had first to turn the sidecrank and ring once. Usually it took two or three tries to force the operator to answer, and Mrs. Allison, making any kind of telephone call, approached the phone with resignation and a sort of desperate patience. She had to crank the phone three times this morning before the operator answered, and then it was still longer before Mr. Babcock picked up the receiver at his phone in the corner of the grocery behind the meat table. He said “Store?” with the rising inflection that seemed to indicate suspicion of anyone who tried to communicate with him by means of this unreliable instrument.

“This is Mrs. Allison, Mr. Babcock. I thought I'd give you my order a day early because I wanted to be sure and get some—”

“What say, Mrs. Allison?”

Mrs. Allison raised her voice a little; she saw Mr. Allison, out on the lawn, turn in his chair and regard her sympathetically. “I said, Mr. Babcock, I thought I'd call in my order early so you could send me—”

“Mrs. Allison?” Mr. Babcock said. “You'll come and pick it up?”

“Pick it up?” In her surprise Mrs. Allison let her voice drop back to its normal tone and Mr. Babcock said loudly, “What's that, Mrs. Allison?”

“I thought I'd have you send it out as usual,” Mrs. Allison said.

“Well, Mrs. Allison,” Mr. Babcock said, and there was a pause while Mrs. Allison waited, staring past the phone over her husband's head out into the sky. “Mrs. Allison,” Mr. Babcock went on finally, “I'll tell you, my boy's been working for me went back to school yesterday, and now I got no one to deliver. I only got a boy delivering summers, you see.”

“I thought you always delivered,” Mrs. Allison said.

“Not after Labor Day, Mrs. Allison,” Mr. Babcock said firmly. “You never been here after Labor Day before, so's you wouldn't know, of course.”

“Well,” Mrs. Allison said helplessly. Far inside her mind she was saying, over and over, can't use city manners on country folk, no use getting mad.

“Are you sure?” she asked finally. “Couldn't you just send out an order today, Mr. Babcock?”

“Matter of fact,” Mr. Babcock said, “I guess I couldn't, Mrs. Allison. It wouldn't hardly pay, delivering, with no one else out at the lake.”

“What about Mr. Hall?” Mrs. Allison asked suddenly, “the people who live about three miles away from us out here? Mr. Hall could bring it out when he comes.”

“Hall?” Mr. Babcock said. “John Hall? They've gone to visit her folks upstate, Mrs. Allison.”

“But they bring all our butter and eggs,” Mrs. Allison said, appalled.

“Left yesterday,” Mr. Babcock said. “Probably didn't think you folks would stay on up there.”

“But I told Mr. Hall...” Mrs. Allison started to say, and then stopped. “I'll send Mr. Allison in after some groceries tomorrow,” she said.

“You got all you need till then,” Mr. Babcock said, satisfied; it was not a question, but a confirmation.

After she hung up, Mrs. Allison went slowly out to sit again in her chair next to her husband. “He won't deliver,” she said. “You'll have to go in tomorrow. We've got just enough kerosene to last till you get back.”

“He should have told us sooner,” Mr. Allison said.

It was not possible to remain troubled long in the face of the day; the country had never seemed more inviting, and the lake moved quietly below them, among the trees, with the almost incredible softness of a summer picture. Mrs. Allison sighed deeply, in the pleasure of possessing for themselves that sight of the lake, with the distant green hills beyond, the gentleness of the small wind through the trees.




The weather continued fair; the next morning Mr. Allison, duly armed with a list of groceries, with “kerosene” in large letters at the top, went down the path to the garage, and Mrs. Allison began another pie in her new baking dishes. She had mixed the crust and was starting to pare the apples when Mr. Allison came rapidly up the path and flung open the screen door into the kitchen.

“Damn car won't start,” he announced, with the end-of-the-tether voice of a man who depends on a car as he depends on his right arm.

“What's wrong with it?” Mrs. Allison demanded, stopping with the paring knife in one hand and an apple in the other. “It was all right on Tuesday.”

“Well,” Mr. Allison said between his teeth, “it's not all right on Friday.”

“Can you fix it?” Mrs. Allison asked.

“No,” Mr. Allison said, “I can not. Got to call someone, I guess.”

“Who?” Mrs. Allison asked.

“Man runs the filling station, I guess.” Mr. Allison moved purposefully toward the phone. “He fixed it last summer one time.”

A little apprehensive, Mrs. Allison went on paring apples absentmindedly, while she listened to Mr. Allison with the phone, ringing, waiting, finally giving the number to the operator, then waiting again and giving the number again, giving the number a third time, and then slamming down the receiver.

“No one there,” he announced as he came into the kitchen.

“He's probably gone out for a minute,” Mrs. Allison said nervously; she was not quite sure what made her so nervous, unless it was the probability of her husband's losing his temper completely. “He's there alone, I imagine, so if he goes out there's no one to answer the phone.”

“That must be it,” Mr. Allison said with heavy irony. He slumped into one of the kitchen chairs and watched Mrs. Allison paring apples. After a minute, Mrs. Allison said soothingly, “Why don't you go down and get the mail and then call him again?”

Mr. Allison debated and then said, “Guess I might as well.”

He rose heavily and when he got to the kitchen door he turned and said, “But if there's no mail—” and leaving an awful silence behind him, he went off down the path.

Mrs. Allison hurried with her pie. Twice she went to the window to glance at the sky to see if there were clouds coming up. The room seemed unexpectedly dark, and she herself felt in the state of tension that preceded a thunderstorm, but both times when she looked the sky was clear and serene, smiling indifferently down on the Allisons' summer cottage as well as on the rest of the world. When Mrs. Allison, her pie ready for the oven, went a third time to look outside, she saw her husband coming up the path; he seemed more cheerful, and when he saw her, he waved eagerly and held a letter in the air.

“From Jerry,” he called as soon as he was close enough for her to hear him, “at last—a letter!” Mrs. Allison noticed with concern that he was no longer able to get up the gentle slope of the path without breathing heavily; but then he was in the doorway, holding out the letter. “I saved it till I got here,” he said.

Mrs. Allison looked with an eagerness that surprised her on the familiar handwriting of her son; she could not imagine why the letter excited her so, except that it was the first they had received in so long; it would be a pleasant, dutiful letter, full of the doings of Alice and the children, reporting progress with his job, commenting on the recent weather in Chicago, closing with love from all; both Mr. and Mrs. Allison could, if they wished, recite a pattern letter from either of their children.

Mr. Allison slit the letter open with great deliberation, and then he spread it out on the kitchen table and they leaned down and read it together.

“Dear Mother and Dad,” it began, in Jerry's familiar, rather childish, handwriting, “Am glad this goes to the lake as usual, we always thought you came back too soon and ought to stay up there as long as you could. Alice says that now that you're not as young as you used to be and have no demands on your time, fewer friends, etc., in the city, you ought to get what fun you can while you can. Since you two are both happy up there, it's a good idea for you to stay.”

Uneasily Mrs. Allison glanced sideways at her husband; he was reading intently, and she reached out and picked up the empty envelope, not knowing exactly what she wanted from it. It was addressed quite as usual, in Jerry's handwriting, and was postmarked “Chicago.” Of course it's postmarked Chicago, she thought quickly, why would they want to postmark it anywhere else? When she looked back down at the letter, her husband had turned the page, and she read on with him: “—and of course if they get measles, etc., now, they will be better off later. Alice is well, of course; me too. Been playing a lot of bridge lately with some people you don't know, named Carruthers. Nice young couple, about our age. Well, will close now as I guess it bores you to hear about things so far away. Tell Dad old Dickson, in our Chicago office, died. He used to ask about Dad a lot. Have a good time up at the lake, and don't bother about hurrying back. Love from all of us, Jerry.”

“Funny,” Mr. Allison commented.

“It doesn't sound like Jerry,” Mrs. Allison said in a small voice. “He never wrote anything like...” she stopped.

“Like what?” Mr. Allison demanded. “Never wrote anything like what?”

Mrs. Allison turned the letter over, frowning. It was impossible to find any sentence, any word, even, that did not sound like Jerry's regular letters. Perhaps it was only that the letter was so late, or the unusual number of dirty fingerprints on the envelope.

“I don't know,” she said impatiently.

“Going to try that phone call again,” Mr. Allison said.

Mrs. Allison read the letter twice more, trying to find a phrase that sounded wrong. Then Mr. Allison came back and said, very quietly, “Phone's dead.”

“What?” Mrs. Allison said, dropping the letter.

“Phone's dead,” Mr. Allison said.




The rest of the day went quickly; after a lunch of crackers and milk, the Allisons went to sit outside on the lawn, but their afternoon was cut short by the gradually increasing storm clouds that came up over the lake to the cottage, so that it was as dark as evening by four o'clock. The storm delayed, however, as though in loving anticipation of the moment it would break over the summer cottage, and there was an occasional flash of lightning, but no rain. In the evening Mr. and Mrs. Allison, sitting close together inside their cottage, turned on the battery radio they had brought with them from New York. There were no lamps lighted in the cottage, and the only light came from the lightning outside and the small square glow from the dial of the radio.

The slight framework of the cottage was not strong enough to withstand the city noises, the music and the voices, from the radio, and the Allisons could hear them far off echoing across the lake, the saxophones in the New York dance band wailing over the water, the flat voice of the girl vocalist going inexorably out into the clean country air. Even the announcer, speaking glowingly of the virtues of razor blades, was no more than an inhuman voice sounding out from the Allisons' cottage and echoing back, as though the lake and the hills and the trees were returning it unwanted.

During one pause between commercials, Mrs. Allison turned and smiled weakly at her husband. “I wonder if we're supposed to... do anything,” she said.

“No,” Mr. Allison said consideringly. “I don't think so. Just wait.”

Mrs. Allison caught her breath quickly, and Mr. Allison said, under the trivial melody of the dance band beginning again, “The car had been tampered with, you know. Even I could see that.”

Mrs. Allison hesitated a minute and then said very softly, “I suppose the phone wires were cut.”

“I imagine so,” Mr. Allison said.

After a while, the dance music stopped and they listened attentively to a news broadcast, the announcer's rich voice telling them breathlessly of a marriage in Hollywood, the latest baseball scores, the estimated rise in food prices during the coming week. He spoke to them, in the summer cottage, quite as though they still deserved to hear news of a world that no longer reached them except through the fallible batteries on the radio, which were already beginning to fade, almost as though they still belonged, however tenuously, to the rest of the world.

Mrs. Allison glanced out the window at the smooth surface of the lake, the black masses of the trees, and the waiting storm, and said conversationally, “I feel better about that letter of Jerry's.”

“I knew when I saw the light down at the Hall place last night,” Mr. Allison said.

The wind, coming up suddenly over the lake, swept around the summer cottage and slapped hard at the windows. Mr. and Mrs. Allison involuntarily moved closer together, and with the first sudden crash of thunder, Mr. Allison reached out and took his wife's hand. And then, while the lightning flashed outside, and the radio faded and sputtered, the two old people huddled together in their summer cottage and waited.





The Rock


Being on the water was not precisely a unique, but rather an unusual, experience for Paula Ellison, and for the first few minutes that she sat on the small seat almost too close to the front of the boat, she was perfectly still, afraid not so much of upsetting the boat as of being unprepared when it surely did upset. She had gotten in first, and sat with her back to the island where they were going, watching the young man in the oilskin jacket as he helped first her sister-in-law Virginia, and then her brother Charles, into the more comfortable seats in the center of the boat. Charles, Paula thought, looked tired, and she thought further that she did not grudge him the better seat, or the reassurance of sitting next to Virginia, because Charles had certainly been so very ill, and was still not well, and looked tired after their journey.

“I'm so excited,” Virginia said, and bounced in the boat almost like a child. Then she added, in the gentle voice both she and Paula were now using toward Charles, “How do you feel, darling?”

“Very well indeed,” Charles said. “Very much better.”

“It looks so exciting,” Virginia said. “Look at it, all dark and rocky against the sky and that perfect sunset.”

“What is that picture?” Charles asked. “You know the one.”

“Like a pirate stronghold,” Virginia continued ecstatically, “or a prison or some—”

Paula said with amusement, “Charles, do you think it entirely wise to bring Virginia to a place where she can indulge her romantic temperament so fully?”

Charles, without hearing her, said to Virginia, “Actually, I'm afraid it's only a rather ordinary summer resort.” He smiled at his sister. “Do you think we might find one pirate for Virginia?”

Paula, without meaning to, looked over his head to the young man in the oilskin jacket who was running the boat, and found him at that moment looking at her, so that she turned quickly away and said, “It's cold.”

“It is cold.” Virginia pulled her coat closer around her.

“We're here so late in the year,” Charles said.

Paula said immediately, “That's much better, you know; it means we'll be practically the only people and won't have to bother being sociable.”

Virginia added, almost as quickly, “And I always think these early fall days are the best, after all. Relaxing,” she added vaguely.

“Well, at least I didn't keep us from any vacation at all this year,” Charles said.

“I never intended to take any vacation this year,” Virginia said. “I hate going away in the summers, and the children are so much better off not going into public resorts.”

“As you know,” Paula said stiffly, “I rarely plan on a vacation at all. If it hadn't been for your insisting that you needed me—”

Charles laughed. “You worry too much,” he said, turning from Virginia to Paula. “You don't have to fuss every time I mention being sick.”

“You're not to think about it,” Paula said.

“We all want to forget it,” Virginia said.

“It's forgotten,” Charles said. “How much longer will it take to reach the island?” From the inflection of his voice everyone immediately assumed that he was speaking to the young man in the oilskin jacket and did not know how otherwise to address him, whether as “driver” or “captain” or “ferryman” or perhaps “boy.”

After a minute the young man said, “Nearly there.”

“Does the island have a name?” Virginia asked.

“People round here call it mostly Rock Island,” the young man said.

“Even that is exciting,” Virginia said. She looked first at Charles and then at Paula. “Even that it should be named Rock Island. Like a stronghold, or a fort, or a—”

“Rock,” Paula said.

“We land on the other side,” the young man said, without being asked; it was as though every person whom he carried to the island asked the same series of questions, made the same comments, spoke of pirates and that picture, you know, and went on to ask how long now? and what was the name of the island, and as though the next question had to be “Where do we land?” or “Do we dock there?” or “How are you going to get the boat up onto those rocks?” and this time, for once, impatient and perhaps tired of ferrying, he answered the question before it could be asked. Paula, who thought that Virginia was again going to say “How exciting,” said quickly, “Charles, are you tired?”

“No,” he said, surprised. “Not tired at all; I'm feeling very well, really.”

Although she had not intended to view this island, this site of her unexpected holiday, so soon, had meant ever since she stepped into the boat without being allowed a chance of turning around to keep her back steadfastly against the island and not turn, not turn, until she was close enough to touch it, Paula at last forgot her resolution and turned to look; she saw, looming impossibly large over her head and with the red sunset behind, a great black jagged rock, without signs of humanity or sympathy, with only dreadful reaching black rocks and sharp incredible outlines against the sunset and she said (thinking, I can always go back if it's too awful), “Charles, how do you feel?”

“I feel fine,” he said sharply,

“It's just all too exciting,” Virginia said.

As the boat came closer it appeared that the island was composed of a single rock instead of many; there were no pebbles or splinters of rock at the edges of the water in the little cove to which the young man guided the boat, and a series of steps leading up to the house above seemed to be carved out of the rock. The sun had gone by now and only a faint impression of the sunset lay in the sky; it had grown much colder and the coming darkness made the rock look blacker and the steps steep and wet.

“Can we get up there at all?” Paula said, leaning from the boat to look at the steps; realizing that she was expected to stand and move from the boat onto the steps she hesitated and then reflected that she could hardly stay on in the boat unless she chose to go back with the ferryman. I wish for once Virginia would move first, she thought, or Charles, and then rebuked herself with the recollection that after all Virginia could hardly climb over Paula in the end seat to get out, and Charles was ill. The young man stepped easily from the boat onto the rock and held out his hand to Paula, and she remembered that he had helped Virginia into the boat earlier, and took his hand and found herself with less grace than usual almost scrambling onto the rock steps. They were not wet, after all, or slippery, but seemed actually to press back against her feet as though holding firmly against her.

I like it here, she thought, surprising herself, and found the steps irresistible; before Virginia was even out of the boat Paula had turned and begun to climb. At first she only enjoyed the pressure of the steps under her feet, and then she raised her head and saw the house above her and she began to climb faster.

“Look at Paula, so far ahead,” she heard Charles saying below her; he sounded cross, and she thought that perhaps he was annoyed with her for having spoken so much of his illness. Ahead of her the windows of the house showed light and then the door opened and someone came into the doorway, looking down and seeming to peer through the darkness.

“Who is it?” the woman in the doorway called.

Required to identify herself suddenly, Paula hesitated on the steps and then turned and looked behind her. Charles and Virginia were following her slowly, helping one another, and Paula felt first a small pang that she had not stayed with them, but had gone on so easily herself. Then, past the curve of the rock below her, she saw the boat going back, and was suddenly very frightened when she realized that the boat and the ferryman had never intended to stay with them; how will we ever get back? she wondered, and then smiled at herself, thinking that surely the ferryman must come back several times a day.

“Are you all right?” she called down to Charles and Virginia. “Shall I come back and help you?”

“We're all right,” Virginia called up to her. “The steps are just a little steep for Charles.”

Paula turned and climbed on up to the house while the woman in the doorway stood watching her. “So you've come,” said the woman in the doorway when Paula was close enough for her to speak. “I'd almost given up expecting you.”

Not a very gracious hostess, Paula thought. “We've been late for everything all day,” she explained. “Trains, busses, meals, everything.”

“You'll have to take what you can get here tonight,” the woman said. “Dinner's been done with for an hour, and the dishes washed and put away.”

“I'm sure we won't want much,” Paula said. She was displeased, and as she came up onto the last, wilder steps which led to the doorway she did not stop to look at the woman, but brushed past her and went inside. The room into which she came seemed to be made of the rock of the island, and for a minute she stood staring, forgetting the landlady behind her. A great fire burned on the far side of the huge room, and flickered against the walls in lines that might have been reflecting mica in rock, ran in light up and down the wide dark walls on which no pictures hung, and shattered itself oddly across and along the floor on which no rug lay. The furniture was huge and wooden, a great trestle table with benches on either side, and a long wooden bench with back and arms which brought the word “settle” to Paula's mind, and huge square wooden chairs, worn and smooth with use. There were no ornaments of any kind and no light except from the great fire.

Paula heard the landlady, still behind her in the doorway, calling down to Charles and Virginia that it was only a bit more to come, and then the landlady added very quietly, “You'll want to put in curtains and such, I daresay.”

“Were you speaking to me?” Paula asked; there seemed no one else around.

“And flowers, I suppose.”

Paula advanced to the fire and stood warming her hands. “It's a most unusual room,” she said. She was trying to identify her own feelings; over and above everything else was a great despair and impulsive dislike of this house, this woman, this room; she tried to tell herself that it was the usual reaction to finishing a long journey and finding less comfort than she had been dreaming of since she left home. More than this, however, she was discouraged; this did not seem at all the sort of place in which to spend a belated vacation and she was anxious over how Charles and Virginia would feel about it. It'll be better in the morning when the sun is out, she told herself, and heard Charles and Virginia greeting the landlady.

“Did our suitcases come?” Charles was asking immediately; he had overseen their departure.

“This morning,” said the landlady. “They're in your rooms.”

“Splendid,” said Charles. He came over to the fire and stood beside Paula. “Chill in the air,” he said.

“It gets cold nights, this time of year,” the landlady said.

“This is an extraordinary room,” Virginia said. “It looks as though it's made out of rock.”

“It is rock, as a matter of fact,” said the landlady. “Most unusual. The greater part of the house is made of rock; I have a small booklet describing it for tourists, and I have put copies in your rooms. It is regarded as a most unusual house.”

“It is most unusual,” said Charles. “You are Mrs. Carter, of course?”

“Mrs. Carter,” said the landlady, nodding. “Mr. and Mrs. Ellison.”

“And Miss Ellison,” said Charles, indicating Paula.

“Of course,” said the landlady. “I have your rooms ready.”

“Splendid,” Charles said; he had taken command again now that there was no physical exertion required, and he looked patronizingly ovcr Paula to say to the landlady, “Any chance of our having somcthing to eat?”

The landlady waved her head back and forth sadly. “You came so late, you know,” she said. “I can give you cheese, and beer; and perhaps, if you wanted to wait for a broiled chicken...”

“Just some tea for me, thanks,” said Virginia.

“I should like some tea,” Paula said.

“Whatever you can find, then, in a minute or so,” Charles said. “Nothing that means any trouble.”

The landlady nodded politely and went out of the room, and Charles, looking around with an odd smile, said “Well.”

“Isn't it wonderful?” said Virginia. “That marvelous old woman, and this house...” she gestured at the walls and then, remembering, laughed and turned to Paula. “You know what she said to me, that funny old woman?” she demanded. “When I was just coming in the door, she whispered to me, was the tall woman with our party?” She laughed again. “Meaning you,” she said to Paula.

“She didn't seem to like me,” Paula said.

“These women are unaccountable,” Charles said. “Remember she lives practically alone on this island.”

“In this wonderful house,” Virginia said.




It was substantially better in the daylight. They had slept in rooms adjoining one another, Charles and Virginia in a huge fourposter bed with curtains, and Paula in a small room with windows overlooking the water almost directly, and in the morning, lying awake in her bed, Paula was for a minute surprised at the moving reflections on the ceiling of her room before she realized that it was only the reflection of the sun on the water, reflected again through her windows. She rose from the bed and went to look out on the water and was shocked to see the steep and immediate fall of the island below her; this was the side of the island away from the steps they had come up the night before, and all this part of the house almost hung over the water. Looking down, Paula thought how in many ways this might be extraordinarily good for Charles after his illness, and good for Virginia and Paula too, since the whole aspect of the island lacked that cloying servitude which they all three hated by now, Charles from receiving it for so long, and she and Virginia from giving it; there was here no sense of heavy luxury and overrich surroundings, but only a very clear and distinct effect of an island out of sight of the mainland, sharp and strong alone on the water, and nothing below but solid rock and nothing more to do, perhaps, than endure the constant and incessant triumphs of water over rock, rock over water.

“I could spend all day,” she thought, almost speaking aloud, “just standing somewhere watching the horizon, or sitting on a high rock, or walking down to the water and up again.”

She put on a pair of heavy shoes, since if she were going to climb rocks she must be protected against their animosity, and went down the wide wooden stairs of the house into the stone room, where already this morning a fire was burning and the heavy furniture looked burnished in the sunlight through the windows. A clean napkin lay on the long wooden table and on it a heavy cup like the one she had had her tea from the night before, and a wooden trencher. Paula went to the door which she had learned led to the kitchen, opened it slightly, and called “Good morning.”

“Well, there,” said the landlady from somewhere within. “With us already?”

She swung the kitchen door wide and came into the stone room with an earthenware jug which she set down on the table. “Coffee,” she said. “You'll have eggs, perhaps? And bacon? Fresh-made rolls?”

“Thank you,” Paula said. Even the landlady seemed more cheerful this morning, and Paula thought that perhaps this was because she herself was not so sullen. “I'll have anything I may,” she said, smiling. “I never dreamed I could be so hungry.”

“It's being near the water,” the landlady said profoundly. “You'll always have good appetite here. I've known them eat a whole chicken at a sitting.”

“Tell me,” Paula said, coming closer to look at the earthenware jug of coffee, “your dishes are so unusual, and so lovely. Where did you ever find them?”

“They came with the house,” the landlady said. “I keep them because people seem to think they belong.”

“They do, indeed,” Paula said.

“Hard to wash clean,” said the landlady, disappearing again into the kitchen.

This morning the moving lines of the firelight on the stone walls were caught and pursued by reflections of sunlight, and the broad windows overlooking the sea and the rock glittered until Paula wondered if the island could be seen from the mainland as a bright light on the horizon. She poured herself a cup of coffee from the earthenware jug, admiring its weight and solidity, and stood with her cup by the window, looking out. When the kitchen door opened she said without turning, “What is the rock the island is made of? I'd really swear it was black.”

“Jet?” said the landlady's voice, musing, “malachite? I don't remember, but it's in the little book.”

Paula came to the table and sat down, and served herself with eggs and bacon onto the wooden trencher. The landlady stood by, silently, and when Paula began to eat she said, “You'll see my other guest this morning.”

“Another guest?” said Paula.

“You'll be wanting to meet him as soon as possible,” said the landlady.

“Who is he?” said Paula, but the landlady was going into the kitchen. She finished her breakfast and lighted a cigarette, and came back to the window with her cigarette and her coffee cup, and pulled one of the great wooden chairs around to sit in, so that she was almost hidden by the back of it and was surprised for a minute by the landlady's scolding voice until she realized it could not possibly be addressed to her.

“She's been and gone, of course,” said the landlady. “You ought to have come an hour ago.” There was the dull sound of the wooden trenchers being stacked together and the landlady's voice went on, “I can't after all keep coming to look for you when I want you; there are people here needing food and bedding and attention, and where you've gone I can never tell.”

Since she was eavesdropping, Paula thought that the only thing to do was stand up immediately and go to the table for more coffee as though she had not been listening at all, which turned out to be more difficult than she thought, when she saw the landlady's surprised face.

“She's here again, then,” the landlady said. “This will be the other guest, Miss.”

I hope she doesn't fall to addressing all her guests so impertinently, Paula thought, and turned to smile at the other guest; she felt an immediate shock of recognition, as though this were someone she had known all her life, and then realized that she had never seen him before. “How do you do,” she said, and then stopped because she did not know his name.

“How do you do, Miss Ellison,” he said courteously but in such a low voice that she was not completely sure if he had called her by name. He seemed so frightened of her that she refrained from asking his name, but only smiled again and said, “I was admiring the view of the water from the window.”

“That's why I like an island,” he said. His tone and his manner were precisely those of someone excruciatingly shy, who cannot always stop to frame sensible remarks. He was very small, and held his hands in front of him in an attitude of cringing, and the only fact against his being so terribly shy was that he did not avoid looking at her, as a shy person would, but kept his eyes fixed upon her in a sort of hypnotized stare, and, staring back rudely, Paula thought that his eyes must be almost the color and texture of the rock itself.

“I was waiting for your sister-in-law, actually,” he said.

“She'll be down in a while,” said Paula, trying not to smile. Virginia was small and lovely, and shy little men like this always found her reassuring. “She was very tired after our trip yesterday, and I expect she'll sleep late.”

“You'll do, of course,” he said ineptly.

“Thank you,” Paula said with gravity. “Have you been here long?”

“Quite a while,” said the little man vaguely. “A very long time, in fact.”

“I understand that this is quite a popular spot earlier in the year.”

“Moderately so. Never more than a few people, that is.” He looked at her earnestly. “Not many people feel at home on an island,” he said.

“I suppose only a certain sort of person would find this stimulating,” Paula said. She glanced out the window again and down to the sea below. “It's an excellent place for my brother to be, right now; he's been very ill, and needed precisely this kind of lonely, stimulating spot.”

“It will probably do him a great deal of good,” said the little man politely.

“I hope so,” said Paula. She was thinking of how such a concrete, limited world as an island and the sea might be extraordinarily helpful to Charles, since he would be given no choice except rock or water, and could not waste his mind in a thousand distractions; he might come to see everything, as she sternly hoped, in terms of solidity and fluidity, and learn that the rock was, as a place to live, far preferable to the sea. Perhaps, even, confining Charles to an island for a while would result in his taking an island away with him and being thus enabled to preserve for himself this kind of firm rock to live on always... The little man disturbed her by saying, “You mustn't be entirely sure of the rock, you know.”

“I beg your pardon?”

“Well, it's been here for a number of years, of course... and rock is a hard thing to get rid of...”

“I don't understand.”

“It doesn't matter at all,” he said nervously. “Your brother's illness—it's given you a good deal of worry?”

“Of course,” she said; she had mentioned Charles's illness originally as a sort of warning; it would be wisest, she felt, to let the other guest know immediately that Charles had been very ill indeed and must not be disturbed, and must not, indeed, be allowed to disturb others with vagaries left over from his illness. She had not expected, however, that the conversation might allow this little man to feel that he had any right to ask more personal questions; a polite murmur of sympathy was the most she had felt was required of him.

“It's been very difficult for you,” he said.

“Do you expect to be here long?” She hoped she did not sound too emphatic; these little men were sometimes hard to discourage and yet, on the other hand, they might be so easily affronted.

“Not much longer now.” He smiled at her, and again she thought that his eyes in the timid face were much like the rock under her feet. “I intend to walk up to the high rock this morning,” he said. “The highest point on the island. You can't miss it.”

“It must be very interesting,” she said flatly.

“I shall be there all morning,” he said. “Just follow the path that begins under your windows. Good-by.”

As she stood staring at the doorway out of which he had gone so suddenly she heard footsteps on the stairs, and a moment later her sister-in-law came into the room.

“Charles is feeling very tired and plans to stay in bed,” she said. “Good morning, Paula dear.”

“Good morning, Virginia. I'm so sorry about Charles.”

“Is this coffee?”

The landlady came in, bustling and fussing at Virginia; Virginia would have fresh-baked rolls and bacon, and perhaps a gently boiled egg? Would Virginia have peaches brought from the mainland this morning? And the poor sick gentleman; would he have a tray?

Paula stood at the window and watched Virginia breakfast; already the sharp air of the sea outside had made her impatient with being indoors, and she found herself unwilling to move into the room when Virginia invited her to sit at the table and take more coffee; the window was at present as close as she might reasonably go to the outdoors, and she must remain within sight of the sea.

“Wonderful coffee,” said Virginia. “I'm so hungry.”

The landlady came over to the window and leaned out, standing near Paula.

“He'll be up on the high rock,” she said softly.

“I know, he—”

“Mrs. Carter,” said Virginia, “might I possibly have another of your incredible muffins?”

The landlady hurried off and into the kitchen, and Virginia said, without turning around, “Isn't she unbelievable?”

“Would you like to go for a walk this morning?” Paula asked. “If Charles is resting, you and I could go exploring.”

“Love to,” said Virginia. “All over the island—I can't wait.”

The kitchen door swung open and the landlady returned, saying as she came, “The tray has gone up to the poor gentleman, and I hope he feels the better for it.”

“Mrs. Carter,” said Paula deliberately, “will you tell me the name of your other guest?”

“You ladies will be wanting fresh coffee,” said the landlady, peering into the coffee jug; “shame on me for letting you waste yourselves on this.”

“What other guest?” said Virginia as the landlady hurried off again.

“An odd little man,” Paula said.

“And the view,” said the landlady, returning, “you'll be wanting to see the view.”

“My sister and I thought we might walk over the island this morning,” Paula said.

“Indeed you will,” said the landlady, “and if the poor gentleman upstairs calls, I'll be right here.”

“Where would you suggest we start?” Paula asked.

“Well,” said the landlady. She stopped, thinking, her hands on her broad hips, and frowning slightly. “Most people,” she said, “prefer the steps down to the sea and then the path around the seashore. Or if you turn to the right as you leave the front door, you will find a path that takes you through our garden. If it were earlier in the year I might suggest bathing in the cove, but delicate young ladies do not care for bathing when the weather is chilled. Or perhaps—”

“What about the path that starts under my window?”

“That of course,” said the landlady, “takes you just back down to the seashore again. Only if you go so far away and the poor gentleman upstairs should happen to call...”

“We'd better stay near the house,” Virginia said.

“You were asking about my kitchens,” said the landlady to Virginia. “If the other lady chooses to go walking and yet you want to stay within hearing of the poor gentleman upstairs, I would account it a pleasure to show you my kitchens.”

“I should love to see them,” Virginia said. “Paula?”

“The other young lady is aching to be outside,” the landlady said. “Some of us cannot resist the sea.” She smiled politely at Paula and then turned again to Virginia. “If you are finished with your coffee,” she said, “it might be as well to start before the day is much along.” As Virginia rose, the landlady said over her shoulder to Paula, “We'll see you back, then, by lunchtime. Mind the slippery rocks.”




“Ah-Johnson,” said the little man. “Yes, Johnson.”

“I'm Paula Ellison, Mr. Johnson.”

“Yes, of course. It was Virginia Ellison I was—yes, of course.”

“Marvelous view up here.”

“Isn't it? You'll be tired of the sound of your brother's voice, I expect?”

“Why, I don't know that I am, particularly. Of course, he's been so very ill.”

“Yes.”

“It's been quite a strain on both of us.”

“Both of us? Oh, yes, Virginia, I see.”

“We've had to take very careful charge of him.”

“Of course. It must have been most upsetting.”

“Well—tiring.”

“Your own brother. Yes, I quite understand. And his wife such a—may I say?—such a dependent person.”

“She did as much as she was able.”

“Of course. As much as she was able, yes.”

“She is not strong. And she had the children.”

“Let me confess—I do dislike children. You do too, I take it?”

“Well... not of course my own nieces.”

“Of course not. Your own brother's children. But with the responsibility so much on you, and your sister-in-law so dependent, and the children too—it is not surprising you have been allowed to exhaust yourself.”

“It has been very tiring, yes.”

“And then of course in addition there would be the realization that there is actually no tie like that of flesh and blood. No love like that between brother and sister.”

“We have always been very close, Mr. Johnson.”

“Of course. Unusually so, I daresay.”

“Perhaps we have. Too close, perhaps.”

“Neither of you could do very well without the other, I suppose. And it is so hard when one is ill.”

“Very hard.”

“I suppose you have never been so ill?”

“Never.”

“But I darcsay if you were, your brother would care for you as attentively as you care for him.”

“If he could, yes.”

“He has so much more to worry about. His children, his wife.”

“He would hardly have much time for me.”

“His wife would need him. She is so dependent, she could hardly spare him to care for his sister. Only his sister, when his wife and children need him at home.”

“I am sure she would be most concerned if anything happened to me.”

“Most concerned, yes. She is really very fond of you, I suppose.”

“We are very fond of each other. Quite companionable.”

“Perhaps your mutual concern over your brother brought you even closer together. You share one dear object, after all.”

“Charles is very dear to both of us.”

“Of course. His wife is probably with him now.”

“I ought to go back.”

“Not at all. If she is there, you can hardly be needed.”




“Now then,” said the landlady heartily, “here you are, back again much before you're wanted. My little joke,” she added, looking at Paula's frown. “I am indeed a great joker. And you didn't stay long. Nothing to worry about with your sister, neither. She's up with the poor gentleman has been so ill, and I daresay gives him better medicine than any of us could, with the smile on her sweet face. And so you met Mr. Arnold?”

“Arnold? He said his name was Johnson.”

“And so it is, if he says so. I'll be calling you Arnold or Heathen or something, give me my head; I never could remember a name and that's the truth. So you met him, whatever he chooses to call himself?”

“I ran into him by accident.”

“So you did, dear, so you did. And you'll be wanting to know now where you can meet him next?”

“Nothing of the sort,” said Paula stiffly. “I was about to go up—”

“To the high rock again? He won't be there by now. Tomorrow maybe. Try late tonight in front of the great fire, after the rest of us are abed. There you will find him.”

“Certainly not,” said Paula.

“Well, then it'll take you a while,” said the landlady. “And the things he can tell you and all. Solid rock,” she continued smoothly as Virginia came into the room, “and standing here since no one knows when.”

“How is Charles?” Paula asked Virginia.

“Feeling much better, thank you,” Virginia said.

“I'll just go up for a minute.”

“Please don't,” said Virginia hastily. “I mean, he said he was going to try to sleep and it would he better not to disturb him.”




“And then of course there's Virginia, so weak, and so safe.”

“She's not entirely safe—”

“Not entirely. But for all you or I could do...”

“She's very fond of me.”

“And very fond of Charles. But so dependent. So pretty, too, and so weak, and so fragile. Such a pretty girl.”

“I have been very necessary to her.”

“Of course now that Charles is better you will not be quite so necessary. They will have each other again.”

“That is as it should be.”

“As you say. That is as it should be. And you?”

“I shall go home again, I suppose.”

“Home?”

“I have a small apartment. I left there of course while Charles was so very ill. It was necessary for me to stay with Virginia.”

“But now you will go back?”

“I have not been asked to stay with Virginia.”

“They have each other again. And the children, and their home. I suppose they will feel sorry for you?”

“Sorry for me?”

“That you have gone, I mean. Sorry to be without you.”

“I suppose so.”

“See how the fire shines on the walls. It is perfectly safe here in this room, of course. This room is solid rock. It is only in the rest of the house that fire might be a danger. The rest of the house is of wood.”




“Virginia, will you come exploring with me today?” Paula stood by the window; it was her daily habit now to take her breakfast there, sitting in the great wooden chair, where she could keep sight of the sea. During the day she found the sound and the smell and the sight of the sea almost a necessity for her, and at night she either sat late in the rock room with the great fire roaring before her and the sound of the sea all outside, or lay straight and silent on her narrow bed with the windows open onto the cliffs below and the sea almost in her room. “We've been here almost a week, and I don't believe you've so much as stepped outdoors.”

“It makes me nervous,” said Virginia. She smiled across the coffee jug at Paula. “I think I'm beginning to feel caught in by the island. Almost homesick for land on all sides instead of sea.”

“Charles likes it.”

“Sometimes,” said Virginia. “Sometimes he's as much afraid as I am.”

“Afraid, Virginia?”

“You know,” Virginia said, gesturing vaguely. “You get to feeling so sort of cut off from everything. No way of escape. No way to get home again.”

“I thought I'd run up and see Charles after breakfast,” Paula said. “Is he sleeping?”

“Resting, anyway. Why don't you put it off until after lunch?”

“I will probably not be back. I intended to take a lunch with me and spend all day on the rocks.”

“What can you find to do out there?”

“I find it stimulating, nothing but the sea and the rocks and nothing between them but me.”

“And do you run across the other guest?” Virginia asked innocently.

“I sometimes gather shells, but there are no very interesting ones.”

“You spoke once of another guest,” Virginia said insistently. “Didn't you once mention an odd little man?”

“Suppose I just run up and say good morning to Charles, and spend just a minute trying to cheer him up?”

“He's cheerful enough. Why don't you wait till tonight?”

“I'd like to see him now, if you're sure you don't mind.”

Silently, Virginia followed Paula upstairs and into the room Virginia and Charles shared. Paula had been here daily since they came, but Charles had not yet come downstairs, protesting that he was convalescing well enough in his bed, with the smell of the sea in his room and its sound in his ears always, and the landlady's good food brought to him regularly. He looked better, Paula thought; he had more color in his face—surprising, since he had not been outdoors or even had fresh air in the room—and he was astonishingly vigorous for someone who had been so very ill for such a long time.

“Good morning, Charles dear,” she said as she entered. “And how well you look today!”

“I feel splendidly well,” Charles said from the bed. He hoisted himself up slightly and turned his cheek for his sister's morning kiss. “You look well, Paula.”

“I love it here. I'm afraid Virginia is bored, though.”

“Is she?” Charles smiled over Paula's head at Virginia. “I don't think so,” he said.

“You must try to get outdoors, Charles, and get nearer the sea. I can't tell you how invigorating I find it.”

“Perhaps you do,” Charles said. “Virginia and I prefer it indoors. We like our sea through windows.”

“And here's the poor gentleman's breakfast,” said the landlady, bustling in with her tray. “Did he think I had forgotten him? When I was only waiting for hot corncakes from the oven? And see that you eat all of it, my poor Mr. Ellison, and we will have you well in no time at all.”

“Will you have your breakfast, darling?” Virginia asked. She came closer to the bed. “Excuse me, Paula; let me come in here and see that his tray is right. Darling, are you hungry? I had such a wonderful breakfast downstairs.”

“Good morning, Miss Ellison,” said Mr. Johnson from the doorway. Paula looked up, over the heads of Charles and Virginia and the landlady and saw him, somehow taller, standing leaning against the doorway. “And how are you this morning?”

“I had eggs, and homemade sausage, just as you have, only I didn't have these wonderful corncakes. Just try one, darling. I believe Mrs. Carter made them especially for you.”

“And how is your poor sick brother? Is he any better? And your sister-in-law, how is she?”

“Good morning, Mr. Johnson,” Paula said.

“I beg your pardon, dear?” said Virginia, looking back at Paula over her shoulder. “Did you ask Charles something?”

“I doubt if she will bother with me, Miss Ellison. I doubt very much if she would ever be interested in me now.”

Paula turned and stared, first at Charles and Virginia, who was bending over him laughing and feeding him, and then at the landlady, who was watching Paula silently and with an expression which might have been humorous.

“Mrs. Carter—” Paula said.

Mrs. Carter shrugged.

Mr. Johnson went on smoothly, “It had to be one or the other of you, you see; I told you I was waiting for your sister-in-law, but you would come first. It was your decision, you know; I would have been satisfied with either.”

“Just don't try to answer him, dear,” Mrs. Carter whispered. “There's no answer he'll take.” She put a protective arm around Paula. “Try to hide behind me,” she said very softly.

“No use, Mrs. Carter,” he said, and, smiled sadly. “No use at all, you know.” He nodded at Paula. “She knows,” he said, and went swiftly and silently away.





A Visit


1


The house in itself was, even before anything had happened there, as lovely a thing as she had ever seen. Set among its lavish grounds, with a park and a river and a wooded hill surrounding it, and carefully planned and tended gardens close upon all sides, it lay upon the hills as though it were something too precious to be seen by everyone; Margaret's very coming there had been a product of such elaborate arrangement, and such letters to and fro, and such meetings and hopings and wishings, that when she alighted with Carla Rhodes at the doorway of Carla's home, she felt that she too had come home, to a place striven for and earned. Carla stopped before the doorway and stood for a minute, looking first behind her, at the vast reaching gardens and the green lawn going down to the river, and the soft hills beyond, and then at the perfect grace of the house, showing so clearly the long-boned structure within, the curving staircases and the arched doorways and the tall thin lines of steadying beams, all of it resting back against the hills, and up, past rows of windows and the flying lines of the roof, on, to the tower—Carla stopped, and looked, and smiled, and then turned and said, “Welcome, Margaret.”

“It's a lovely house,” Margaret said, and felt that she had much better have said nothing.

The doors were opened and Margaret, touching as she went the warm head of a stone faun beside her, passed inside. Carla, following, greeted the servants by name, and was welcomed with reserved pleasure; they stood for a minute on the rose-and-white tield floor. “Again, welcome, Margaret,” Carla said.

Far ahead of them the great stairway soared upward, held to the hall where they stood by only the slimmest of carved balustrades; on Margaret's left hand a tapestry moved softly as the door behind was closed. She could see the fine threads of the weave, and the light colors, but she could not have told the picture unless she went far away, perhaps as far away as the staircase, and looked at it from there; perhaps, she thought, from halfway up the stairway this great hall, and perhaps the whole house, is visible, as a complete body of story together, all joined and in sequence. Or perhaps I shall be allowed to move slowly from one thing to another, observing each, or would that take all the time of my visit?

“I never saw anything so lovely,” she said to Carla, and Carla smiled.

“Come and meet my mama,” Carla said.

They went through doors at the right, and Margaret, before she could see the light room she went into, was stricken with fear at meeting the owners of the house and the park and the river, and as she went beside Carla she kept her eyes down.

“Mama,” said Carla, “this is Margaret, from school.”

“Margaret,” said Carla's mother, and smiled at Margaret kindly. “We are very glad you were able to come.”

She was a tall lady wearing pale green and pale blue, and Margaret said as gracefully as she could, “Thank you, Mrs. Rhodes; I am very grateful for having been invited.”

“Surely,” said Mrs. Rhodes softly, “surely my daughter's friend Margaret from school should be welcome here; surely we should be grateful that she has come.”

“Thank you, Mrs. Rhodes,” Margaret said, not knowing how she was answering, but knowing that she was grateful.

When Mrs. Rhodes turned her kind eyes on her daughter, Margaret was at last able to look at the room where she stood next to her friend; it was a pale-green and a pale-blue long room with tall windows that looked out onto the lawn and the sky, and thin colored china ornaments on the mantel. Mrs. Rhodes had left her needlepoint when they came in and from where Margaret stood she could see the pale sweet pattern from the underside; all soft colors it was, melting into one another endlessly, and not finished. On the table near by were books, and one large book of sketches that were most certainly Carla's; Carla's harp stood next to the windows, and beyond one window were marble steps outside, going shallowly down to a fountain, where water moved in the sunlight. Margaret thought of her own embroidery—a pair of slippers she was working for her friend—and knew that she should never be able to bring it into this room, where Mrs. Rhodes's long white hands rested on the needlepoint frame, soft as dust on the pale colors.

“Come,” said Carla, taking Margaret's hand in her own, “Mama has said that I might show you some of the house.”

They went out again into the hall, across the rose and white tiles which made a pattern too large to be seen from the floor, and through a doorway where tiny bronze fauns grinned at them from the carving. The first room that they went into was all gold, with gilt on the window frames and on the legs of the chairs and tables, and the small chairs standing on the yellow carpet were made of gold brocade with small gilded backs, and on the wall were more tapestries showing the house as it looked in the sunlight with even the trees around it shining, and these tapestries were let into the wall and edged with thin gilded frames.

“There is so much tapestry,” Margaret said.

“In every room,” Carla agreed. “Mama has embroidered all the hangings for her own room, the room where she writes her letters. The other tapestries were done by my grandmamas and my great-grandmamas and my great-great-grandmamas.”

The next room was silver, and the small chairs were of silver brocade with narrow silvered backs, and the tapestries on the walls of this room were edged with silver frames and showed the house in moonlight, with the white light shining on the stones and the windows glittering.

“Who uses these rooms?” Margaret asked.

“No one,” Carla said.

They passed then into a room where everything grew smaller as they looked at it: the mirrors on both sides of the room showed the door opening and Margaret and Carla coming through, and then, reflected, a smaller door opening and a small Margaret and a smaller Carla coming through, and then, reflected again, a still smaller door and Margaret and Carla, and so on, endlessly, Margaret and Carla diminishing and reflecting. There was a table here and nesting under it another lesser table, and under that another one, and another under that one, and on the greatest table lay a carved wooden bowl holding within it another carved wooden bowl, and another within that, and another within that one. The tapestries in this room were of the house reflected in the lake, and the tapestries themselves were reflected, in and out, among the mirrors on the wall, with the house in the tapestries reflected in the lake.

This room frightened Margaret rather, because it was so difficult for her to tell what was in it and what was not, and how far in any direction she might easily move, and she backed out hastily, pushing Carla behind her. They turned from here into another doorway which led them out again into the great hall under the soaring staircase, and Carla said, “We had better go upstairs and see your room; we can see more of the house another time. We have plenty of time, after all,” and she squeezed Margaret's hand joyfully.

They climbed the great staircase, and passed, in the hall upstairs, Carla's room, which was like the inside of a shell in pale colors, with lilacs on the table, and the fragrance of the lilacs followed them as they went down the halls.

The sound of their shoes on the polished floor was like rain, but the sun came in on them wherever they went. “Here,” Carla said, opening a door, “is where we have breakfast when it is warm; here,” opening another door, “is the passage to the room where Mama does her letters. And that —” nodding “—is the stairway to the tower, and here is where we shall have dances when my brother comes home.”

“A real tower?” Margaret said.

“And here,” Carla said, “is the old schoolroom, and my brother and I studied here before he went away, and I stayed on alone studying here until it was time for me to come to school and meet you.”

“Can we go up into the tower?” Margaret asked.

“Down here, at the end of the hall,” Carla said, “is where all my grandpapas and my grandmamas and my great-great-grandpapas and grandmamas live.” She opened the door to the long gallery, where pictures of tall old people in lace and pale waistcoats leaned down to stare at Margaret and Carla. And then, to a walk at the top of the house, where they leaned over and looked at the ground below and the tower above, and Margaret looked at the gray stone of the tower and wondered who lived there, and Carla pointed out where the river ran far below, far away, and said they should walk there tomorrow.

“When my brother comes,” she said, “he will take us boating on the river.”

In her room, unpacking her clothes, Margaret realized that her white dress was the only one possible for dinner, and thought that she would have to send home for more things; she had intended to wear her ordinary gray downstairs most evenings before Carla's brother came, but knew she could not when she saw Carla in light blue, with pearls around her neck. When Margaret and Carla came into the drawing room before dinner Mrs. Rhodes greeted them very kindly, and asked had Margaret seen the painted room or the room with the tiles?

“We had no time to go near that part of the house at all,” Carla said.

“After dinner, then,” Mrs. Rhodes said, putting her arm affectionately around Margaret's shoulders, “we will go and see the painted room and the room with the tiles, because they are particular favorites of mine.”

“Come and meet my papa,” Carla said.

The door was just opening for Mr. Rhodes, and Margaret, who felt almost at ease now with Mrs. Rhodes, was frightened again of Mr. Rhodes, who spoke loudly and said, “So this is m'girl's friend from school? Lift up your head, girl, and let's have a look at you.” When Margaret looked up blindly, and smiled weakly, he patted her cheek and said, “We shall have to make you look bolder before you leave us,” and then he tapped his daughter on the shoulder and said she had grown to a monstrous fine girl.

They went in to dinner, and on the walls of the dining room were tapestries of the house in the seasons of the year, and the dinner service was white china with veins of gold running through it, as though it had been mined and not moulded. The fish was one Margaret did not recognize, and Mr. Rhodes very generously insisted upon serving her himself without smiling at her ignorance. Carla and Margaret were each given a glassful of pale spicy wine.

“When my brother comes,” Carla said to Margaret, “we will not dare be so quiet at table.” She looked across the white cloth to Margaret, and then to her father at the head, to her mother at the foot, with the long table between them, and said, “My brother can make us laugh all the time.”

“Your mother will not miss you for these summer months?” Mrs. Rhodes said to Margaret.

“She has my sisters, ma'am,” Margaret said, “and I have been away at school for so long that she has learned to do without me.”

“We mothers never learn to do without our daughters,” Mrs. Rhodes said, and looked fondly at Carla. “Or our sons,” she added with a sigh.

“When my brother comes,” Carla said, “you will see what this house can be like with life in it.”

“When does he come?” Margaret asked.

“One week,” Mr. Rhodes said, “three days, and four hours.”

When Mrs. Rhodes rose, Margaret and Carla followed her, and Mr. Rhodes rose gallantly to hold the door for them all.

That evening Carla and Margaret played and sang duets, although Carla said that their voices together were too thin to be appealing without a deeper voice accompanying, and that when her brother came they should have some splendid trios. Mrs. Rhodes complimented their singing, and Mr. Rhodes fell asleep in his chair.

Before they went upstairs Mrs. Rhodes reminded herself of her promise to show Margaret the painted room and the room with the tiles, and so she and Margaret and Carla, holding their long dresses up away from the floor in front so that their skirts whispered behind them, went down a hall and through a passage and down another hall, and through a room filled with books and then through a painted door into a tiny octagonal room where each of the sides was paneled and painted, with pink and blue and green and gold small pictures of shepherds and nymphs, lambs and fauns, playing on the broad green lawns by the river, with the house standing lovely behind them. There was nothing else in the little room, because seemingly the paintings were furniture enough for one room, and Margaret felt surely that she could stay happily and watch the small painted people playing, without ever seeing anything more of the house. But Mrs. Rhodes led her on, into the room of the tiles, which was not exactly a room at all, but had one side all glass window looking out onto the same lawn of the pictures in the octagonal room. The tiles were set into the floor of this room, in tiny bright spots of color which showed, when you stood back and looked at them, that they were again a picture of the house, only now the same materials that made the house made the tiles, so that the tiny windows were tiles of glass, and the stones of the tower were chips of gray stone, and the bricks of the chimneys were chips of brick.

Beyond the tiles of the house Margaret, lifting her long skirt as she walked, so that she should not brush a chip of the tower out of place, stopped and said, “What is this?” And stood back to see, and then knelt down and said, “What is this?”

“Isn't she enchanting?” said Mrs. Rhodes, smiling at Margaret, “I've always loved her.”

“I was wondering what Margaret would say when she saw it,” said Carla, smiling also.

It was a curiously made picture of a girl's face, with blue-chip eyes and a red-chip mouth, staring blindly from the floor, with long light braids made of yellow stone chips going down evenly on either side of her round cheeks.

“She is pretty,” said Margaret, stepping back to see her better. “What does it say underneath?”

She stepped back again, holding her head up and back to read the letters, pieced together with stone chips and set unevenly in the floor. “Here was Margaret,” it said, “who died for love.”

There was, of course, not time to do everything. Before Margaret had seen half the house, Carla's brother came home. Carla came running up the great staircase one afternoon calling “Margaret, Margaret, he's come,” and Margaret, running down to meet her, hugged her and said, “I'm so glad.”

He had certainly come, and Margaret, entering the drawing room shyly behind Carla, saw Mrs. Rhodes with tears in her eyes and Mr. Rhodes standing straighter and prouder than before, and Carla said, “Brother, here is Margaret.”

He was tall and haughty in uniform, and Margaret wished she had met him a little later, when she had perhaps been to her room again, and perhaps tucked up her hair. Next to him stood his friend, a captain, small and dark and bitter, and smiling bleakly upon the family assembled. Margaret smiled back timidly at them both, and stood behind Carla.

Everyone then spoke at once. Mrs. Rhodes said “We've missed you so,” and Mr. Rhodes said “Glad to have you back, m'boy,” and Carla said “We shall have such times—I've promised Margaret—” and Carla's brother said “So this is Margaret?” and the dark captain said “I've been wanting to come.”

It seemed that they all spoke at once, every time; there would be a long waiting silence while all of them looked around with joy at being together, and then suddenly everyone would have found something to say. It was so at dinner: Mrs. Rhodes said “You're not eating enough,” and “You used to be more fond of pomegranates,” and Carla said “We're to go boating,” and “We'll have a dance, won't we?” and “Margaret and I insist upon a picnic,” and “I saved the river for my brother to show to Margaret.” Mr. Rhodes puffed and laughed and passed the wine, and Margaret hardly dared lift her eyes. The black captain said “Never realized what an attractive old place it could be, after all,” and Carla's brother said “There's much about the house I'd like to show Margaret.”

After dinner they played charades, and even Mrs. Rhodes did Achilles with Mr. Rhodes, holding his heel and both of them laughing and glancing at Carla and Margaret and the captain. Carla's brother leaned on the back of Margaret's chair and once she looked up at him and said, “No one ever calls you by name. Do you actually have a name?”

“Paul,” he said.

The next morning they walked on the lawn, Carla with the captain and Margaret with Paul. They stood by the lake, and Margaret looked at the pure reflection of the house and said, “It almost seems as though we could open a door and go in.”

“There,” said Paul, and he pointed with his stick at the front entrance. “There is where we shall enter, and it will swing open for us with an underwater crash.”

“Margaret,” said Carla, laughing, “you say odd things, sometimes. If you tried to go into that house, you'd be in the lake.”

“Indeed, and not like it much, at all,” the captain added.

“Or would you have the side door?” asked Paul, pointing with his stick.

“I think I prefer the front door,” said Margaret.

“But you'd be drowned,” Carla said. She took Margaret's arm as they started back toward the house, and said, “We'd make a scene for a tapestry right now, on the lawn before the house.”

“Another tapestry?” said the captain, and grimaced.

They played croquet, and Paul hit Margaret's ball toward a wicket, and the captain accused her of cheating prettily. And they played word games in the evening, and Margaret and Paul won, and everyone said Margaret was so clever. And they walked endlessly on the lawns before the house, and looked into the still lake, and watched the reflection of the house in the water, and Margaret chose a room in the reflected house for her own, and Paul said she should have it.

“That's the room where Mama writes her letters,” said Carla, looking strangely at Margaret.

“Not in our house in the lake,” said Paul.

“And I suppose if you like it she would lend it to you while you stay,” Carla said.

“Not at all,” said Margaret amiably. “I think I should prefer the tower anyway.”

“Have you seen the rose garden?” Carla asked.

“Let me take you there,” said Paul.

Margaret started across the lawn with him, and Carla called to her, “Where are you off to now, Margaret?”

“Why, to the rose garden,” Margaret called back, and Carla said, staring, “You are really very odd, sometimes, Margaret. And it's growing colder, far too cold to linger among the roses,” and so Margaret and Paul turned back.

Mrs. Rhodes's needlepoint was coming on well. She had filled in most of the outlines of the house, and was setting in the windows. After the first small shock of surprise, Margaret no longer wondered that Mrs. Rhodes was able to set out the house so well without a pattern or a plan; she did it from memory and Margaret, realizing this for the first time, thought “How amazing,” and then “But of course; how else would she do it?”

To see a picture of the house, Mrs. Rhodes needed only to lift her eyes in any direction, but, more than that, she had of course never used any other model for her embroidery; she had of course learned the faces of the house better than the faces of her children. The dreamy life of the Rhodeses in the house was most clearly shown Margaret as she watched Mrs. Rhodes surely and capably building doors and windows, carvings and cornices, in her embroidered house, smiling tenderly across the room to where Carla and the captain bent over a book together, while her fingers almost of themselves turned the edge of a carving Margaret had forgotten or never known about until, leaning over the back of Mrs. Rhodes's chair, she saw it form itself under Mrs. Rhodes's hands.

The small thread of days and sunlight, then, that bound Margaret to the house, was woven here as she watched. And Carla, lifting her head to look over, might say, “Margaret, do come and look, here. Mother is always at her work, but my brother is rarely home.”

They went for a picnic, Carla and the captain and Paul and Margaret, and Mrs. Rhodes waved to them from the doorway as they left, and Mr. Rhodes came to his study window and lifted his hand to them. They chose to go to the wooded hill beyond the house, although Carla was timid about going too far away—“I always like to be where I can see the roofs, at least,” she said—and sat among the trees, on moss greener than Margaret had ever seen before, and spread out a white cloth and drank red wine.

It was a very proper forest, with neat trees and the green moss, and an occasional purple or yellow flower growing discreetly away from the path. There was no sense of brooding silence, as there sometimes is with trees about, and Margaret realized, looking up to see the sky clearly between the branches, that she had seen this forest in the tapestries in the breakfast room, with the house shining in the sunlight beyond.

“Doesn't the river come through here somewhere?” she asked, hearing, she thought, the sound of it through the trees. “I feel so comfortable here among these trees, so at home.”

“It is possible,” said Paul, “to take a boat from the lawn in front of the house and move without sound down the river, through the trees, past the fields and then, for some reason, around past the house again. The river, you see, goes almost around the house in a great circle. We are very proud of that.”

“The river is near by,” said Carla. “It goes almost completely around the house.”

“Margaret,” said the captain. “You must not look rapt on a picnic unless you are contemplating nature.”

“I was, as a matter of fact,” said Margaret. “I was contemplating a caterpillar approaching Carla's foot.”

“Will you come and look at the river?” said Paul, rising and holding his hand out to Margaret. “I think we can see much of its great circle from near here.”

“Margaret,” said Carla as Margaret stood up. “You are always wandering off.”

“I'm coming right back,” Margaret said, with a laugh. “It's only to look at the river.”

“Don't be away long,” Carla said, “We must be getting back before dark.”

The river as it went through the trees was shadowed and cool, broadening out into pools where only the barest movement disturbed the ferns along its edge, and where small stones made it possible to step out and see the water all around, from a precarious island, and where without sound a leaf might be carried from the limits of sight to the limits of sight, moving swiftly but imperceptibly and turning a little as it went.

“Who lives in the tower, Paul?” asked Margaret, holding a fern and running it softly over the back of her hand. “I know someone lives there, because I saw someone moving at the window once.”

“Not lives there,” said Paul, amused. “Did you think we kept a political prisoner locked away?”

“I thought it might be the birds, at first,” Margaret said, glad to be describing this to someone.

“No,” said Paul, still amused. “There's an aunt, or a greataunt, or perhaps even a great-great-great-aunt. She doesn't live there, at all, but goes there because she says she cannot endure the sight of tapestry.” He laughed. “She has filled the tower with books, and a huge old cat, and she may practice alchemy there, for all anyone knows. The reason you've never seen her would be that she has one of her spells of hiding away. Sometimes she is downstairs daily.”

“Will I ever meet her?” Margaret asked wonderingly.

“Perhaps,” Paul said. “She might take it into her head to come down formally one night to dinner. Or she might wander carelessly up to you where you sat on the lawn, and introduce herself. Or you might never see her, at that.”

“Suppose I went up to the tower?”

Paul glanced at her strangely. “I suppose you could, if you wanted to,” he said. “I've been there.”

“Margaret,” Carla called through the woods. “Margaret, we shall be late if you do not give up brooding by the river.”

All this time, almost daily, Margaret was seeing new places in the house: the fan room, where the most delicate filigree fans had been set into the walls with their fine ivory sticks painted in exquisite miniature; the small room where incredibly perfect wooden and glass and metal fruits and flowers and trees stood on glittering glass shelves, lined up against the windows. And daily she passed and repassed the door behind which lay the stairway to the tower, and almost daily she stepped carefully around the tiles on the floor which read “Here was Margaret, who died for love.”

It was no longer possible, however, to put off going to the tower. It was no longer possible to pass the doorway several times a day and do no more than touch her hand secretly to the panels, or perhaps set her head against and listen, to hear if there were footsteps going up or down, or a voice calling her. It was not possible to pass the doorway once more, and so in the early morning Margaret set her hand firmly to the door and pulled it open, and it came easily, as though relieved that at last, after so many hints and insinuations, and so much waiting and such helpless despair, Margaret had finally come to open it.

The stairs beyond, gray stone and rough, were, Margaret thought, steep for an old lady's feet, but Margaret went up effortlessly, though timidly. The stairway turned around and around, going up to the tower, and Margaret followed, setting her feet carefully upon one step after another, and holding her hands against the warm stone wall on either side, looking forward and up, expecting to be seen or spoken to before she reached the top; perhaps, she thought once, the walls of the tower were transparent and she was clearly, ridiculously visible from the outside, and Mrs. Rhodes and Carla, on the lawn—if indeed they ever looked upward to the tower—might watch her and turn to one another with smiles, saying “There is Margaret, going up to the tower at last,” and, smiling, nod to one another.

The stairway ended, as she had not expected it would, in a heavy wooden door, which made Margaret, standing on the step below to find room to raise her hand and knock, seem smaller, and even standing at the top of the tower she felt that she was not really tall.

“Come in,” said the great-aunt's voice, when Margaret had knocked twice; the first knock had been received with an expectant silence, as though inside someone had said inaudibly, “Is that someone knocking at this door?” and then waited to be convinced by a second knock—and Margaret's knuckles hurt from the effort of knocking to be heard through a heavy wooden door. She opened the door awkwardly from below—how much easier this all would be, she thought, if I knew the way—went in, and said politely, before she looked around, “I'm Carla's friend. They said I might come up to the tower to see it, but of course if you would rather I went away I shall.” She had planned to say this more gracefully, without such an implication that invitations to the tower were issued by the downstairs Rhodeses, but the long climb and her being out of breath forced her to say everything at once, and she had really no time for the sounding periods she had composed.

In any case the great-aunt said politely—she was sitting at the other side of the round room, against a window, and she was not very clearly visible—“I am amazed that they told you about me at all. However, since you are here I cannot pretend that I really object to having you; you may come in and sit down.”

Margaret came obediently into the room and sat clown on the stone bench which ran all the way around the tower room, under the windows which of course were on all sides and open to the winds, so that the movement of the air through the tower room was insistent and constant, making talk difficult and even distinguishing objects a matter of some effort.

As though it were necessary to establish her position in the house emphatically and immediately, the old lady said, with a gesture and a grin, “My tapestries,” and waved at the windows. She seemed to be not older than a great-aunt, although perhaps too old for a mere aunt, but her voice was clearly able to carry through the sound of the wind in the tower room and she seemed compact and strong beside the window, not at all as though she might be dizzy from looking out, or tired from the stairs.

“May I look out the window?” Margaret asked, almost of the cat, which sat next to her and regarded her without friendship, but without, as yet, dislike.

“Certainly,” said the great-aunt. “Look out the windows, by all means.”

Margaret turned on the bench and leaned her arms on the wide stone ledge of the window, but she was disappointed. Although the tops of the trees did not reach halfway up the tower, she could see only branches and leaves below and no sign of the wide lawns or the roofs of the house or the curve of the river.

“I hoped I could see the way the river went, from here.”

“The river doesn't go from here,” said the old lady, and laughed.

“I mean,” Margaret said, “they told me that the river went around in a curve, almost surrounding the house.”

“Who told you?” said the old lady.

“Paul.”

“I see,” said the old lady. “He's back, is he?”

“He's been here for several days, but he's going away again soon.”

“And what's your name?” asked the old lady, leaning forward.

“Margaret.”

“I see,” said the old lady again. “That's my name, too,” she said.

Margaret thought that “How nice” would be an inappropriate reply to this, and something like “Is it?” or “Just imagine” or “What a coincidence” would certainly make her feel more foolish than she believed she really was, so she smiled uncertainly at the old lady and dismissed the notion of saying “What a lovely name.”

“He should have come and gone sooner,” the old lady went on, as though to herself. “Then we'd have it all behind us.”

“Have all what behind us?” Margaret asked, although she felt that she was not really being included in the old lady's conversation with herself, a conversation that seemed—and probably was—part of a larger conversation which the old lady had with herself constantly and on larger subjects than the matter of Margaret's name, and which even Margaret, intruder as she was, and young, could not be allowed to interrupt for very long. “Have all what behind us?” Margaret asked insistently.

“I say,” said the old lady, turning to look at Margaret, “he should have come and gone already, and we'd all be well out of it by now.”

“I see,” said Margaret. “Well, I don't think he's going to be here much longer. He's talking of going.” In spite of herself, her voice trembled a little. In order to prove to the old lady that the trembling in her voice was imaginary, Margaret said almost defiantly, “It will be very lonely here after he has gone.”

“We'll be well out of it, Margaret, you and I,” the old lady said. “Stand away from the window, child, you'll be wet.”

Margaret realized with this that the storm which had—she knew now—been hanging over the house for long sunny days had broken, suddenly, and that the wind had grown louder and was bringing with it through the windows of the tower long stinging rain. There were drops on the cat's black fur, and Margaret felt the side of her face wet. “Do your windows close?” she asked. “If I could help you—”

“I don't mind the rain,” the old lady said. “It wouldn't be the first time it's rained around the tower.”

“I don't mind it,” Margaret said hastily, drawing away from the window. She realized that she was staring back at the cat, and added nervously, “Although, of course, getting wet is—” She hesitated and the cat stared back at her without expression. “I mean,” she said apologetically, “some people don't like getting wet.”

The cat deliberately turned its back on her and put its face closer to the window.

“What were you saying about Paul?” Margaret asked the old lady, feeling somehow that there might he a thin thread of reason tangling the old lady and the cat and the tower and the rain, and even, with abrupt clarity, defining Margaret herself and the strange hesitation which had caught at her here in the tower. “He's going away soon, you know.”

“It would have been better if it were over with by now,” the old lady said. “These things don't take really long, you know, and the sooner the better, I say.”

“I suppose that's true,” Margaret said intelligently.

“After all,” said the old lady dreamily, with raindrops in her hair, “we don't always see ahead, into things that are going to happen.”

Margaret was wondering how soon she might politely go back downstairs and dry herself off, and she meant to say politely only so long as the old lady seemed to be talking, however remotely, about Paul. Also, the rain and the wind were coming through the window onto Margaret in great driving gusts, as though Margaret and the old lady and the books and the cat would be washed away, and the top of the tower cleaned of them.

“I would help you if I could,” the old lady said earnestly to Margaret, raising her voice almost to a scream to be heard over the wind and the rain. She stood up to approach Margaret, and Margaret, thinking she was about to fall, reached out a hand to catch her. The cat stood up and spat, the rain came through the window in a great sweep, and Margaret, holding the old lady's hands, heard through the sounds of the wind the equal sounds of all the voices in the world, and they called to her saying “Good-by, good-by,” and “All is lost,” and another voice saying “I will always remember you,” and still another called, “It is so dark.” And, far away from the others, she could hear a voice calling, “Come back, come back.” Then the old lady pulled her hands away from Margaret and the voices were gone. The cat shrank back and the old lady looked coldly at Margaret and said, “As I was saying, I would help you if I could.”

“I'm so sorry,” Margaret said weakly. “I thought you were going to fall.”

“Good-by,” said the old lady.

At the ball Margaret wore a gown of thin blue lace that belonged to Carla, and yellow roses in her hair, and she carried one of the fans from the fan room, a daintily painted ivory thing which seemed indestructible, since she dropped it twice, and which had a tiny picture of the house painted on its ivory sticks, so that when the fan was closed the house was gone. Mrs. Rhodes had given it to her to carry, and had given Carla another, so that when Margaret and Carla passed one another dancing, or met by the punch bowl or in the halls, they said happily to one another, “Have you still got your fan? I gave mine to someone to hold for a minute; I showed mine to everyone. Are you still carrying your fan? I've got mine.”

Margaret danced with strangers and with Paul, and when she danced with Paul they danced away from the others, up and down the long gallery hung with pictures, in and out between the pillars which led to the great hall opening into the room of the tiles. Near them danced ladles in scarlet silk, and green satin, and white velvet, and Mrs. Rhodes, in black with diamonds at her throat and on her hands, stood at the top of the room and smiled at the dancers, or went on Mr. Rhodes's arm to greet guests who came laughingly in between the pillars looking eagerly and already moving in time to the music as they walked. One lady wore white feathers in her hair, curling down against her shoulder; another had a pink scarf over her arms, and it floated behind her as she danced. Paul was in his haughty uniform, and Carla wore red roses in her hair and danced with the captain.

“Are you really going tomorrow?” Margaret asked Paul once during the evening; she knew that he was, but somehow asking the question—which she had done several times before—established a communication between them, of his right to go and her right to wonder, which was sadly sweet to her.

“I said you might meet the great-aunt,” said Paul, as though in answer; Margaret followed his glance, and saw the old lady of the tower. She was dressed in yellow satin, and looked very regal and proud as she moved through the crowd of dancers, drawing her skirt aside if any of them came too close to her. She was coming toward Margaret and Paul where they sat on small chairs against the wall, and when she came close enough she smiled, looking at Paul, and said to him, holding out her hands, “I am very glad to see you, my dear.”

Then she smiled at Margaret and Margaret smiled back, very glad that the old lady held out no hands to her.

“Margaret told me you were here,” the old lady said to Paul, “and I came down to see you once more.”

“I'm very glad you did,” Paul said. “I wanted to see you so much that I almost came to the tower.”

They both laughed and Margaret, looking from one to the other of them, wondered at the strong resemblance between them. Margaret sat very straight and stiff on her narrow chair, with her blue lace skirt falling charmingly around her and her hands folded neatly in her lap, and listened to their talk. Paul had found the old lady a chair and they sat with their heads near together, looking at one another as they talked, and smiling.

“You look very fit,” the old lady said. “Very fit indeed.” She sighed.

“You look wonderfully well,” Paul said.

“Oh, well,” said the old lady. “I've aged. I've aged, I know it.”

“So have I,” said Paul.

“Not noticeably,” said the old lady, shaking her head and regarding him soberly for a minute. “You never will, I suppose.”

At that moment the captain came up and bowed in front of Margaret, and Margaret, hoping that Paul might notice, got up to dance with him.

“I saw you sitting there alone,” said the captain, “and I seized the precise opportunity I have been awaiting all evening.”

“Excellent military tactics,” said Margaret, wondering if these remarks had not been made a thousand times before, at a thousand different balls.

“I could be a splendid tactician,” said the captain gallantly, as though carrying on his share of the echoing conversation, the words spoken under so many glittering chandeliers, “if my objective were always so agreeable to me.”

“I saw you dancing with Carla,” said Margaret.

“Carla,” he said, and made a small gesture that somehow showed Carla as infinitely less than Margaret. Margaret knew that she had seen him make the same gesture to Carla, probably with reference to Margaret. She laughed.

“I forget what I'm supposed to say now,” she told him.

“You're supposed to say,” he told her seriously, “‘And do you really leave us so soon?’”

“And do you really leave us so soon?” said Margaret obediently.

“The sooner to return,” he said, and tightened his arm around her waist. Margaret said, it being her turn, “We shall miss you very much.”

“I shall miss you,” he said, with a manly air of resignation.

They danced two waltzes, after which the captain escorted her handsomely back to the chair from which he had taken her, next to which Paul and the old lady continued in conversation, laughing and gesturing. The captain bowed to Margaret deeply, clicking his heels.

“May I leave you alone for a minute or so?” he asked. “I believe Carla is looking for me.”

“I'm perfectly all right here,” Margaret said. As the captain hurried away she turned to hear what Paul and the old lady were saying.

“I remember, I remember,” said the old lady laughing, and she tapped Paul on the wrist with her fan. “I never imagined there would be a time when I should find it funny.”

“But it was funny,” said Paul.

“We were so young,” the old lady said. “I can hardly remember.”

She stood up abruptly, bowed to Margaret, and started back across the room among the dancers. Paul followed her as far as the doorway and then left her to come back to Margaret. When he sat down next to her he said, “So you met the old lady?”

“I went to the tower,” Margaret said.

“She told me,” he said absently, looking down at his gloves. “Well,” he said finally, looking up with an air of cheerfulness. “Are they never going to play a waltz?”




Shortly before the sun came up over the river the next morning they sat at breakfast, Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes at the ends of the table, Carla and the captain, Margaret and Paul. The red roses in Carla's hair had faded and been thrown away, as had Margaret's yellow roses, but both Carla and Margaret still wore their ball gowns, which they had been wearing for so long that the soft richness of them seemed natural, as though they were to wear nothing else for an eternity in the house, and the gay confusion of helping one another dress, and admiring one another, and straightening the last folds to hang more gracefully, seemed all to have happened longer ago than memory, to be perhaps a dream that might never have happened at all, as perhaps the figures in the tapestries on the walls of the dining room might remember, secretly, an imagined process of dressing themselves and coming with laughter and light voices to sit on the lawn where they were woven. Margaret, looking at Carla, thought that she had never seen Carla so familiarly as in this soft white gown, with her hair dressed high on her head—had it really been curled and pinned that way? Or had it always, forever, been so?—and the fan in her hand—had she not always had that fan, held just so?—and when Clara turned her head slightly on her long neck she captured the air of one of the portraits in the long gallery. Paul and the captain were still somehow trim in their uniforms; they were leaving at sunrise.

“Must you really leave this morning?” Margaret whispered to Paul.

“You are all kind to stay up and say good-by,” said the captain, and he leaned forward to look down the table at Margaret, as though it were particularly kind of her.

“Every time my son leaves me,” said Mrs. Rhodes, “it is as though it were the first time.”

Abruptly, the captain turned to Mrs. Rhodes and said, “I noticed this morning that there was a bare patch on the grass before the door. Can it be restored?”

“I had not known,” Mrs. Rhodes said, and she looked nervously at Mr. Rhodes, who put his hand quietly on the table and said, “We hope to keep the house in good repair so long as we are able.”

“But the broken statue by the lake?” said the captain. “And the tear in the tapestry behind your head?”

“It is wrong of you to notice these things,” Mrs. Rhodes said, gently.

“What can I do?” he said to her. “It is impossible not to notice these things. The fish are dying, for instance. There are no grapes in the arbor this year. The carpet is worn to thread near your embroidery frame,” he bowed to Mrs. Rhodes, “and in the house itself—” bowing to Mr. Rhodes “—there is a noticeable crack over the window of the conservatory, a crack in the solid stone. Can you repair that?”

Mr. Rhodes said weakly, “It is very wrong of you to notice these things. Have you neglected the sun, and the bright perfection of the drawing room? Have you been recently to the gallery of portraits? Have you walked on the green portions of the lawn, or only watched for the bare places?”

“The drawing room is shabby,” said the captain softly. “The green brocade sofa is torn a little near the arm. The carpet has lost its luster. The gilt is chipped on four of the small chairs in the gold room, the silver paint scratched in the silver room. A tile is missing from the face of Margaret, who died for love, and in the great gallery the paint has faded slightly on the portrait of—” bowing again to Mr. Rhodes “—your great-great-great grandfather, sir.”

Mr. Rhodes and Mrs. Rhodes looked at one another, and then Mrs. Rhodes said, “Surely it is not necessary to reproach us for these things?”

The captain reddened and shook his head.

“My embroidery is very nearly finished,” Mrs. Rhodes said. “I have only to put the figures into the foreground.”

“I shall mend the brocade sofa,” said Carla.

The captain glanced once around the table, and sighed. “I must pack,” he said. “We cannot delay our duties even though we have offended lovely women.” Mrs. Rhodes, turning coldly away from him, rose and left the table, with Carla and Margaret following.

Margaret went quickly to the tile room, where the white face of Margaret who died for love stared eternally into the sky beyond the broad window. There was indeed a tile missing from the wide white cheek, and the broken spot looked like a tear, Margaret thought; she kneeled down and touched the tile face quickly to be sure that it was not a tear.

Then she went slowly back through the lovely rooms; across the broad rose-and-white tiled hall, and into the drawing room, and stopped to close the tall doors behind her.

“There really is a tile missing,” she said.

Paul turned and frowned; he was standing alone in the drawing room, tall and bright in his uniform, ready to leave. “You are mistaken,” he said. “It is not possible that anything should be missing.”

“I saw it.”

“It is not true, you know,” he said. He was walking quickly up and down the room, slapping his gloves on his wrist, glancing nervously, now and then, at the door, at the tall windows opening out onto the marble stairway. “The house is the same as ever,” he said. “It does not change.”

“But the worn carpet...” It was under his feet as he walked.

“Nonsense,” he said violently. “Don't you think I'd know my own house? I care for it constantly, even when they forget; without this house I could not exist; do you think it would begin to crack while I am here?”

“How can you keep it from aging? Carpets will wear, you know, and unless they are replaced...”

“Replaced?” He stared as though she had said something evil. “What could replace anything in this house?” He touched Mrs. Rhodes's embroidery frame, softly. “All we can do is add to it.”

There was a sound outside; it was the family coming down the great stairway to say good-by. He turned quickly and listened, and it seemed to be the sound he had been expecting. “I will always remember you,” he said to Margaret, hastily, and turned again toward the tall windows. “Good-by.”

“It is so dark,” Margaret said, going beside him. “You will come back?”

“I will come back,” he said sharply. “Good-by.” He stepped across the sill of the window onto the marble stairway outside; he was black for a moment against the white marble, and Margaret stood still at the window watching him go down the steps and away through the gardens. “Lost, lost,” she heard faintly, and, from far away, “All is lost.”

She turned back to the room, and, avoiding the worn spot in the carpet and moving widely around Mrs. Rhodes's embroidery frame, she went to the great doors and opened them. Outside, in the hall with the rose-and-white tiled floor, Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes and Carla were standing with the captain.

“Son,” Mrs. Rhodes was saying, “when will you be back?”

“Don't fuss at me,” the captain said. “I'll be back when I Can.”

Carla stood silently, a little away. “Please be careful,” she said, and, “Here's Margaret, come to say good-by to you, Brother.”

“Don't linger, m'boy,” said Mr. Rhodes. “Hard on the women.”

“There are so many things Margaret and I planned for you while you were here,” Carla said to her brother. “The time has been so short.”

Margaret, standing beside Mrs. Rhodes, turned to Carla's brother (and Paul; who was Paul?) and said, “Good-by.” He bowed to her and moved to go to the door with his father.

“It is hard to see him go,” Mrs. Rhodes said. “And we do not know when he will come back.” She put her hand gently on Margaret's shoulder. “We must show you more of the house,” she said. “I saw you one day try the door of the ruined tower; have you seen the hall of flowers? Or the fountain room?”

“When my brother comes again,” Carla said, “we shall have a musical evening, and perhaps he will take us boating on the river.”

“And my visit?” said Margaret smiling. “Surely there will be an end to my visit?”

Mrs. Rhodes, with one last look at the door from which Mr. Rhodes and the captain had gone, dropped her hand from Margaret's shoulder and said, “I must go to my embroidery. I have neglected it while my son was with us.”

“You will not leave us before my brother comes again?” Carla asked Margaret.

“I have only to put the figures into the foreground,” Mrs. Rhodes said, hesitating on her way to the drawing room. “I shall have you exactly if you sit on the lawn near the river.”

“We shall be models of stillness,” said Carla, laughing. “Margaret, will you come and sit beside me on the lawn?”





One Ordinary Day, with Peanuts


Mr. John Philip Johnson shut his front door behind him and went down his front steps into the bright morning with a feeling that all was well with the world on this best of all days, and wasn't the sun warm and good, and didn't his shoes feel comfortable after the resoling, and he knew that he had undoubtedly chosen the very precise tie that belonged with the day and the sun and his comfortable feet, and, after all, wasn't the world just a wonderful place? In spite of the fact that he was a small man, and though the tie was perhaps a shade vivid, Mr. Johnson radiated a feeling of well-being as he went down the steps and onto the dirty sidewalk, and he smiled at people who passed him, and some of them even smiled back. He stopped at the newsstand on the corner and bought his paper, saying “Good morning” with real conviction to the man who sold him the paper and the two or three other people who were lucky enough to be buying papers when Mr. Johnson skipped up. He remembered to fill his pockets with candy and peanuts, and then he set out to get himself uptown. He stopped in a flower shop and bought a carnation for his buttonhole, and stopped almost immediately afterward to give the carnation to a small child in a carriage, who looked at him dumbly, and then smiled, and Mr. Johnson smiled, and the child's mother looked at Mr. Johnson for a minute and then smiled too.

When he had gone several blocks uptown, Mr. Johnson cut across the avenue and went along a side street, chosen at random; he did not follow the same route every morning, but preferred to pursue his eventful way in wide detours, more like a puppy than a man intent upon business. It happened this morning that halfway down the block a moving van was parked, and the furniture from an upstairs apartment stood half on the sidewalk, half on the steps, while an amused group of people loitered, examining the scratches on the tables and the worn spots on the chairs, and a harassed woman, trying to watch a young child and the movers and the furniture all at the same time, gave the clear impression of endeavoring to shelter her private life from the people staring at her belongings. Mr Johnson stopped, and for a moment joined the crowd, then he came forward and, touching his hat civilly, said, “Perhaps I can keep an eye on your little boy for you?”

The woman turned and glared at him distrustfully, and Mr. Johnson added hastily, “We'll sit right here on the steps.” He beckoned to the little boy, who hesitated and then responded agreeably to Mr. Johnson's genial smile. Mr. Johnson took out a handful of peanuts from his pocket and sat on the steps with the boy, who at first refused the peanuts on the grounds that his mother did not allow him to accept food from strangers; Mr. Johnson said that probably his mother had not intended peanuts to be included, since elephants at the circus ate them, and the boy considered, and then agreed solemnly. They sat on the steps cracking peanuts in a comradely fashion, and Mr. Johnson said, “So you're moving?”

“Yep,” said the boy.

“Where you going?”

“Vermont.”

“Nice place. Plenty of snow there. Maple sugar, too; you like maple sugar?”

“Sure.”

“Plenty of maple sugar in Vermont. You going to live on a farm?”

“Going to live with Grandpa.”

“Grandpa like peanuts?”

“Sure.”

“Ought to take him some,” said Mr. Johnson, reaching into his pocket. “Just you and Mommy going?”

“Yep.”

“Tell you what,” Mr. Johnson said. “You take some peanuts to eat on the train.”

The boy's mother, after glancing at them frequently, had seemingly decided that Mr. Johnson was trustworthy, because she had devoted herself wholeheartedly to seeing that the movers did not—what movers rarely do, but every housewife believes they will—crack a leg from her good table, or set a kitchen chair down on a lamp. Most of the furniture was loaded by now, and she was deep in that nervous stage when she knew there was something she had forgotten to pack—hidden away in the back of a closet somewhere, or left at a neighbor's and forgotten, or on the clothesline—and was trying to remember under stress what it was.

“This all, lady?” the chief mover said, completing her dismay.

Uncertainly, she nodded.

“Want to go on the truck with the furniture, sonny?” the mover asked the boy, and laughed. The boy laughed, too, and said to Mr. Johnson, “I guess I'll have a good time at Vermont.”

“Fine time,” said Mr. Johnson, and stood up. “Have one more peanut before you go,” he said to the boy.

The boy's mother said to Mr. Johnson, “Thank you so much; it was a great help to me.”

“Nothing at all,” said Mr. Johnson gallantly. “Where in Vermont are you going?”

The mother looked at the little boy accusingly, as though he had given away a secret of some importance, and said unwillingly, “Greenwich.”

“Lovely town,” said Mr. Johnson. He took out a card, and wrote a name on the back. “Very good friend of mine lives in Greenwich,” he said. “Call on him for anything you need. His wife makes the best doughnuts in town,” he added soberly to the little boy.

“Swell,” said the little boy.

“Goodbye,” said Mr. Johnson.

He went on, stepping happily with his new-shod feet, feeling the warm sun on his back and on the top of his head. Halfway down the block he met a stray dog and fed him a peanut.

At the corner, where another wide avenue faced him, Mr. Johnson decided to go on uptown again. Moving with comparative laziness, he was passed on either side by people hurrying and frowning, and people brushed past him going the other way, clattering along to get somewhere quickly. Mr. Johnson stopped on every corner and waited patiently for the light to change, and he stepped out of the way of anyone who seemed to be in any particular hurry, but one young lady came too fast for him, and crashed wildly into him when he stooped to pat a kitten which had run out onto the sidewalk from an apartment house and was now unable to get back through the rushing feet.

“Excuse me,” said the young lady, trying frantically to pick up Mr. Johnson and hurry on at the same time, “terribly sorry.”

The kitten, regardless now of danger, raced back to its home. “Perfectly all right,” said Mr. Johnson, adjusting himself carefully. “You seem to be in a hurry.”

“Of course I'm in a hurry,” said the young lady. “I'm late.”

She was extremely cross, and the frown between her eyes seemed well on its way to becoming permanent. She had obviously awakened late, because she had not spent any extra time in making herself look pretty, and her dress was plain and unadorned with collar or brooch, and her lipstick was noticeably crooked. She tried to brush past Mr. Johnson, but, risking her suspicious displeasure, he took her arm and said, “Please wait.”

“Look,” she said ominously, “I ran into you, and your lawyer can see my lawyer and I will gladly pay all damages and all inconveniences suffered therefrom, but please this minute let me go because I am late.”

“Late for what?” said Mr. Johnson; he tried his winning smile on her but it did no more than keep her, he suspected, from knocking him down again.

“Late for work,” she said between her teeth. “Late for my employment. I have a job, and if I am late I lose exactly so much an hour and I cannot really afford what your pleasant conversation is costing me, be it ever so pleasant.”

“I'll pay for it,” said Mr. Johnson. Now, these were magic words, not necessarily because they were true, or because she seriously expected Mr. Johnson to pay for anything, but because Mr. Johnson's flat statement, obviously innocent of irony, could not be, coming from Mr. Johnson, anything but the statement of a responsible and truthful and respectable man.

“What do you mean?” she asked.

“I said that since I am obviously responsible for your being late, I shall certainly pay for it.”

“Don't be silly,” she said, and for the first time the frown disappeared. “I wouldn't expect you to pay for anything—a few minutes ago I was offering to pay you. Anyway,” she added, almost smiling, “it was my fault.”

“What happens if you don't go to work?”

She stared. “I don't get paid.”

“Precisely,” said Mr. Johnson.

“What do you mean, precisely? If I don't show up at the office exactly twenty minutes ago I lose a dollar and twenty cents an hour, or two cents a minute or”—she thought—“almost a dime for the time I've spent talking to you.”

Mr. Johnson laughed, and finally she laughed, too. “You're late already,” he pointed out. “Will you give me another four cents' worth?”

“I don't understand why.”

“You'll see,” Mr. Johnson promised. He led her over to the side of the walk, next to the buildings, and said, “Stand here,” and went out into the rush of people going both ways. Selecting and considering, as one who must make a choice involving perhaps whole years of lives, he estimated the people going by. Once he almost moved, and then at the last minute thought better of it and drew back. Finally, from half a block away, he saw what he wanted, and moved out into the center of the traffic to intercept a young man, who was hurrying, and dressed as though he had awakened late, and frowning.

“Oof,” said the young man, because Mr. Johnson had thought of no better way to intercept anyone than the one the young woman had unwittingly used upon him. “Where do you think you're going?” the young man demanded from the sidewalk.

“I want to speak to you,” said Mr. Johnson ominously.

The young man got up nervously, dusting himself and eyeing Mr. Johnson. “What for?” he said. “What'd I do?”

“That's what bothers me most about people nowadays,” Mr. Johnson complained broadly to the people passing. “No matter whether they've done anything or not, they always figure someone's after them. About what you're going to do,” he told the young man.

“Listen,” said the young man, trying to brush past him, “I'm late, and I don't have any time to listen. Here's a dime, now get going.”

“Thank you,” said Mr. Johnson, pocketing the dime. “Look,” he said, “what happens if you stop running?”

“I'm late,” said the young man, still trying to get past Mr. Johnson, who was unexpectedly clinging.

“How much you make an hour?” Mr. Johnson demanded.

“A Communist, are you?” said the young man. “Now will you please let me—”

“No,” said Mr. Johnson insistently, “how much?”

“Dollar fifty,” said the young man. “And now will you—”

“You like adventure?”

The young man stared, and, staring, found himself caught and held by Mr. Johnson's genial smile; he almost smiled back and then repressed it and made an effort to tear away. “I got to hurry,” he said.

“Mystery? You like surprises? Unusual and exciting events?”

“You selling something?”

“Sure,” said Mr. Johnson. “You want to take a chance?”

The young man hesitated, looking longingly up the avenue toward what might have been his destination and then, when Mr. Johnson said “I'll pay for it” with his own peculiar convincing emphasis, turned and said, “Well, okay. But I got to see it first, what I'm buying.”

Mr. Johnson, breathing hard, led the young man over to the side, where the girl was standing; she had been watching with interest Mr. Johnson's capture of the young man and now, smiling timidly, she looked at Mr. Johnson as though prepared to be surprised at nothing.

Mr. Johnson reached into his pocket and took out his wallet “Here,” he said, and handed a bill to the girl. “This about equals your day's pay.”

“But no,” she said, surprised in spite of herself “I mean, I couldn't.”

“Please do not interrupt,” Mr. Johnson told her. “And here,” he said to the young man, “this will take care of you.” The young man accepted the bill dazedly, but said, “Probably counterfeit” to the young woman out of the side of his mouth. “Now,” Mr. Johnson went on, disregarding the young man, “what is your name, miss?”

“Kent,” she said helplessly. “Mildred Kent.”

“Fine,” said Mr. Johnson. “And you, sir?”

“Arthur Adams,” said the young man stiffly.

“Splendid,” said Mr. Johnson. “Now, Miss Kent, I would like you to meet Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams, Miss Kent.”

Miss Kent stared, wet her lips nervously, made a gesture as though she might run, and said, “How do you do?”

Mr. Adams straightened his shoulders, scowled at Mr. Johnson, made a gesture as though he might run, and said, “How do you do?”

“Now, this,” said Mr. Johnson, taking several bills from his wallet, “should be enough for the day for both of you. I would suggest, perhaps, Coney Island—although I personally am not fond of the place—or perhaps a nice lunch somewhere, and dancing, or a matinee, or even a movie, although take care to choose a really good one; there are so many bad movies these days. You might,” he said, struck with an inspiration, “visit the Bronx Zoo, or the Planetarium. Anywhere, as a matter of fact,” he concluded, “that you would like to go. Have a nice time.”

As he started to move away, Arthur Adams, breaking from his dumb-founded stare, said, “But see here, mister, you can't do this. Why—how do you know—I mean, we don't even know—I mean, how do you know we won't just take the money and not do what you said?”

“You've taken the money,” Mr. Johnson said. “You don't have to follow any of my suggestions. You may know something you prefer to do—perhaps a museum, or something.”

“But suppose I just run away with it and leave her here?”

“I know you won't,” said Mr. Johnson gently, “because you remembered to ask me that. Goodbye,” he added, and went on.

As he stepped up the street, conscious of the sun on his head and his good shoes, he heard from somewhere behind him the young man saying, “Look, you know you don't have to if you don't want to,” and the girl saying, “But unless you don't want to...” Mr. Johnson smiled to himself and then thought that he had better hurry along; when he wanted to he could move very quickly, and before the young woman had gotten around to saying, “Well, I will if you will,” Mr. Johnson was several blocks away and had already stopped twice, once to help a lady lift several large packages into a taxi, and once to hand a peanut to a sea gull; By this time he was in an area of large stores and many more people, and he was buffeted constantly from either side by people hurrying and cross and late and sullen. Once he offered a peanut to a man who asked him for a dime, and once he offered a peanut to a bus driver who had stopped his bus at an intersection and had opened the window next to his seat and put out his head as though longing for fresh air and the comparative quiet of the traffic. The man wanting a dime took the peanut because Mr. Johnson had wrapped a dollar bill around it, but the bus driver took the peanut and asked ironically, “You want a transfer, Jack?”

On a busy corner Mr. Johnson encountered two young people—for one minute he thought they might be Mildred Kent and Arthur Adams—who were eagerly scanning a newspaper, their backs pressed against a storefront to avoid the people passing, their heads bent together. Mr. Johnson, whose curiosity was insatiable, leaned onto the storefront next to them and peeked over the man's shoulder; they were scanning the “Apartments Vacant” columns.

Mr. Johnson remembered the street where the woman and her little boy were going to Vermont and he tapped the man on the shoulder and said amiably, “Try down on West Seventeen. About the middle of the block, people moved out this morning.”

“Say, what do you—” said the man, and then, seeing Mr. Johnson clearly, “Well, thanks. Where did you say?”

“West Seventeen,” said Mr. Johnson. “About the middle of the block.” He smiled again and said, “Good luck.”

“Thanks,” said the man.

“Thanks,” said the girl as they moved off.

“Goodbye,” said Mr. Johnson.

He lunched alone in a pleasant restaurant, where the food was rich, and only Mr. Johnson's excellent digestion could encompass two of their whipped-cream-and-chocolate-and-rum-cake pastries for dessert. He had three cups of coffee, tipped the waiter largely, and went out into the street again into the wonderful sunlight, his shoes still comfortable and fresh on his feet. Outside he found a beggar staring into the windows of the restaurant he had left and, carefully looking through the money in his pocket, Mr. Johnson approached the beggar and pressed some coins and a couple of bills into his hand. “It's the price of the veal cutlet lunch plus tip,” said Mr. Johnson. “Goodbye.”

After his lunch he rested; he walked into the nearest park and fed peanuts to the pigeons. It was late afternoon by the time he was ready to start back downtown, and he had refereed two checker games and watched a small boy and girl whose mother had fallen asleep and awakened with surprise and fear that turned to amusement when she saw Mr. Johnson. He had given away almost all of his candy, and had fed all the rest of his peanuts to the pigeons, and it was time to go home. Although the late afternoon sun was pleasant, and his shoes were still entirely comfortable, he decided to take a taxi downtown.

He had a difficult time catching a taxi, because he gave up the first three or four empty ones to people who seemed to need them more; finally, however, he stood alone on the corner and—almost like netting a frisky fish—he hailed desperately until he succeeded in catching a cab that had been proceeding with haste uptown, and seemed to draw in toward Mr. Johnson against its own will.

“Mister,” the cabdriver said as Mr. Johnson climbed in, “I figured you was an omen, like. I wasn't going to pick you up at all.”

“Kind of you,” said Mr. Johnson ambiguously.

“If I'd of let you go it would of cost me ten bucks,” said the driver.

“Really?” said Mr. Johnson.

“Yeah,” said the driver. “Guy just got out of the cab, he turned around and give me ten bucks, said take this and bet it in a hurry on a horse named Vulcan, right away.”

“Vulcan?” said Mr. Johnson, horrified. “A fire sign on a Wednesday?”

“What?” said the driver. “Anyway, I said to myself, if I got no fare between here and there I'd bet the ten, but if anyone looked like they needed a cab I'd take it as an omen and I'd take the ten home to the wife.”

“You were very right,” said Mr. Johnson heartily. “This is Wednesday, you would have lost your money. Monday, yes, or even Saturday. But never never never a fire sign on a Wednesday. Sunday would have been good, now.”

“Vulcan don't run on Sunday,” said the driver.

“You wait till another day,” said Mr. Johnson. “Down this street, please, driver. I'll get off on the next corner.”

“He told me Vulcan, though,” said the driver.

“I'll tell you,” said Mr. Johnson, hesitating with the door of the cab half open. “You take that ten dollars and I'll give you another ten dollars to go with it, and you go right ahead and bet that money on any Thursday on any horse that has a name indicating... let me see, Thursday... well, grain. Or any growing food.”

“Grain?” said the driver. “You mean a horse named, like, Wheat or something?”

“Certainly,” said Mr. Johnson. “Or, as a matter of fact, to make it even easier, any horse whose name includes the letters C, R, L. Perfectly simple.”

“Tall Corn?” said the driver, a light in his eye. “You mean a horse named, like, Tall Corn?”

“Absolutely,” said Mr. Johnson. “Here's your money.”

“Tall Corn,” said the driver. “Thank you, mister.”

“Goodbye,” said Mr. Johnson.

He was on his own corner, and went straight up to his apartment. He let himself in and called, “Hello?” and Mrs. Johnson answered from the kitchen, “Hello, dear, aren't you early?”

“Took a taxi home,” Mr. Johnson said. “I remembered the cheesecake, too. What's for dinner?”

Mrs. Johnson came out of the kitchen and kissed him; she was a comfortable woman, and smiling as Mr. Johnson smiled. “Hard day?” she asked.

“Not very,” said Mr. Johnson, hanging his coat in the closet. “How about you?”

“So-so,” she said. She stood in the kitchen doorway while he settled into his easy chair and took off his good shoes and took out the paper he had bought that morning. “Here and there,” she said.

“I didn't do so badly,” Mr. Johnson said. “Couple young people.”

“Fine,” she said. “I had a little nap this afternoon, took it easy most of the day. Went into a department store this morning and accused the woman next to me of shoplifting, and had the store detective pick her up. Sent three dogs to the pound—you know, the usual thing. Oh, and listen,” she added, remembering.

“What?” asked Mr. Johnson.

“Well,” she said, “I got onto a bus and asked the driver for a transfer, and when he helped someone else first I said that he was impertinent, and quarreled with him. And then I said why wasn't he in the army, and I said it loud enough for everyone to hear, and I took his number and I turned in a complaint. Probably got him fired.”

“Fine,” said Mr. Johnson. “But you do look tired. Want to change over tomorrow?”

“I would like to,” she said. “I could do with a change.”

“Right,” said Mr. Johnson. “What's for dinner?”

“Veal cutlet.”

“Had it for lunch,” said Mr. Johnson.





Louisa, Please Come Home


“Louisa,” my mother's voice came over the radio; it frightened me badly for a minute. “Louisa,” she said, “please come home. It's been three long long years since we saw you last; Louisa, I promise you that everything will be all right. We all miss you so. We want you back again. Louisa, please come home.”

Once a year. On the anniversary of the day I ran away. Each time I heard it I was frightened again, because between one year and the next I would forget what my mother's voice sounded like, so soft and yet strange with that pleading note. I listened every year. I read the stories in the newspapers—“Louisa Tether vanished one year ago”—or two years ago, or three; I used to wait for the twentieth of June as though it were my birthday. I kept all the clippings at first, but secretly; with my picture on all the front pages I would have looked kind of strange if anyone had seen me cutting it out. Chandler, where I was hiding, was close enough to my old home so that the papers made a big fuss about all of it, but of course the reason I picked Chandler in the first place was because it was a big enough city for me to hide in.

I didn't just up and leave on the spur of the moment, you know. I always knew that I was going to run away sooner or later, and I had made plans ahead of time, for whenever I decided to go. Everything had to go right the first time, because they don't usually give you a second chance on that kind of thing and anyway if it had gone wrong I would have looked like an awful fool, and my sister Carol was never one for letting people forget it when they made fools of themselves. I admit I planned it for the day before Carol's wedding on purpose, and for a long time afterward I used to try and imagine Carol's face when she finally realized that my running away was going to leave her one bridesmaid short. The papers said that the wedding went ahead as scheduled, though, and Carol told one newspaper reporter that her sister Louisa would have wanted it that way; “She would never have meant to spoil my wedding,” Carol said, knowing perfectly well that that would be exactly what I'd meant. I'm pretty sure that the first thing Carol did when they knew I was missing was go and count the wedding presents to see what I'd taken with me.

Anyway, Carol's wedding may have been fouled up, but my plans went fine—better, as a matter of fact, than I had ever expected. Everyone was hurrying around the house putting up flowers and asking each other if the wedding gown had been delivered, and opening up cases of champagne and wondering what they were going to do if it rained and they couldn't use the garden, and I just closed the front door behind me and started off. There was only one bad minute when Paul saw me; Paul has always lived next door and Carol hates him worse than she does me. My mother always used to say that every time I did something to make the family ashamed of me Paul was sure to be in it somewhere. For a long time they thought he had something to do with my running away, even though he told over and over again how hard I tried to duck away from him that afternoon when he met me going down the driveway. The papers kept calling him “a close friend of the family,” which must have overjoyed my mother, and saying that he was being questioned about possible clues to my whereabouts. Of course he never even knew that I was running away; I told him just what I told my mother before I left that—I was going to get away from all the confusion and excitement for a while; I was going downtown and would probably have a sandwich somewhere for supper and go to a movie. He bothered me for a minute there, because of course he wanted to come too. I hadn't meant to take the bus right there on the corner but with Paul tagging after me and wanting me to wait while he got the car so we could drive out and have dinner at the Inn, I had to get away fast on the first thing that came along, so I just ran for the bus and left Paul standing there; that was the only part of my plan I had to change.

I took the bus all the way downtown, although my first plan had been to walk. It turned out much better, actually, since it didn't matter at all if anyone saw me on the bus going downtown in my own home town, and I managed to get an earlier train out. I bought a round-trip ticket; that was important, because it would make them think I was coming back; that was always the way they thought about things. If you did something you had to have a reason for it, because my mother and my father and Carol never did anything unless they had a reason for it, so if I bought a round-trip ticket the only possible reason would be that I was coming back. Besides, if they thought I was coming back they would not be frightened so quickly and I might have more time to hide before they came looking for me. As it happened, Carol found out I was gone that same night when she couldn't sleep and came into my room for some aspirin, so all the time I had less of a head start than I thought.

I knew that they would find out about my buying the ticket; I was not silly enough to suppose that I could steal off and not leave any traces. All my plans were based on the fact that the people who get caught are the ones who attract attention by doing something strange or noticeable, and what I intended all along was to fade into some background where they would never see me. I knew they would find out about the round-trip ticket, because it was an odd thing to do in a town where you've lived all your life, but it was the last unusual thing I did. I thought when I bought it that knowing about that round-trip ticket would be some consolation to my mother and father. They would know that no matter how long I stayed away at least I always had a ticket home. I did keep the return-trip ticket quite a while, as a matter of fact. I used to carry it in my wallet as a kind of lucky charm.

I followed everything in the papers. Mrs. Peacock and I used to read them at the breakfast table over our second cup of coffee before I went off to work.

“What do you think about this girl disappeared over in Rockville?” Mrs. Peacock would say to me, and I'd shake my head sorrowfully and say that a girl must be really crazy to leave a handsome, luxurious home like that, or that I had kind of a notion that maybe she didn't leave at all—maybe the family had her locked up somewhere because she was a homicidal maniac. Mrs. Peacock always loved anything about homicidal maniacs.

Once I picked up the paper and looked hard at the picture. “Do you think she looks something like me?” I asked Mrs. Peacock, and Mrs. Peacock leaned back and looked at me and then at the picture and then at me again and finally she shook her head and said, “No. If you wore your hair longer, and curlier, and your face was maybe a little fuller, there might be a little resemblance, but then if you looked like a homicidal maniac I wouldn't ever of let you in my house.”

“I think she kind of looks like me,” I said.

“You get along to work and stop being vain,” Mrs. Peacock told me.

Of course when I got on the train with my round-trip ticket I had no idea how soon they'd be following me, and I suppose it was just as well, because it might have made me nervous and I might have done something wrong and spoiled everything. I knew that as soon as they gave up the notion that I was coming back to Rockville with my round-trip ticket they would think of Crain, which is the largest city that train went to, so I only stayed in Crain part of one day. I went to a big department store where they were having a store-wide sale; I figured that would land me in a crowd of shoppers and I was right; for a while there was a good chance that I'd never get any farther away from home than the ground floor of that department store in Crain. I had to fight my way through the crowd until I found the counter where they were having a sale of raincoats, and then I had to push and elbow down the counter and finally grab the raincoat I wanted right out of the hands of some old monster who couldn't have used it anyway because she was much too fat. You would have thought she had already paid for it, the way she howled. I was smart enough to have the exact change, all six dollars and eighty-nine cents, right in my hand, and I gave it to the salesgirl, grabbed the raincoat and the bag she wanted to put it in, and fought my way out again before I got crushed to death.

That raincoat was worth every cent of the six dollars and eighty-nine cents; I wore it right through until winter that year and not even a button ever came off it. I finally lost it the next spring when I left it somewhere and never got it back. It was tan, and the minute I put it on in the ladies' room of the store I began thinking of it as my “old” raincoat; that was good. I had never before owned a raincoat like that and my mother would have fainted dead away. One thing I did that I thought was kind of clever. I had left home wearing a light short coat; almost a jacket, and when I put on the raincoat of course I took off my light coat. Then all I had to do was empty the pockets of the light coat into the raincoat and carry the light coat casually over to a counter where they were having a sale of jackets and drop it on the counter as though I'd taken it off a little way to look at it and had decided against it. As far as I ever knew no one paid the slightest attention to me, and before I left the counter I saw a woman pick up my jacket and look it over; I could have told her she was getting a bargain for three ninety-eight.

It made me feel good to know that I had gotten rid of the light coat. My mother picked it out for me and even though I liked it and it was expensive it was also recognizable and I had to change it somehow. I was sure that if I put it in a bag and dropped it into a river or into a garbage truck or something like that sooner or later it would be found and even if no one saw me doing it, it would almost certainly be found, and then they would know I had changed my clothes in Crain.

That light coat never turned up. The last they ever found of me was someone in Rockville who caught a glimpse of me in the train station in Crain, and she recognized me by the light coat. They never found out where I went after that; it was partly luck and partly my clever planning. Two or three days later the papers were still reporting that I was in Crain; people thought they saw me on the streets and one girl who went into a store to buy a dress was picked up by the police and held until she could get someone to identify her. They were really looking, but they were looking for Louisa Tether, and I had stopped being Louisa Tether the minute I got rid of that light coat my mother bought me.

One thing I was relying on: there must be thousands of girls in the country on any given day who are nineteen years old, fair-haired, five feet four inches tall, and weighing one hundred and twenty-six pounds. And if there are thousands of girls like that, there must be, among those thousands, a good number who are wearing shapeless tan raincoats; I started counting tan raincoats in Crain after I left the department store and I passed four in one block, so I felt well hidden. After that I made myself even more invisible by doing just what I told my mother I was going to—I stopped in and had a sandwich in a little coffee shop, and then I went to a movie. I wasn't in any hurry at all, and rather than try to find a place to sleep that night I thought I would sleep on the train.

It's funny how no one pays any attention to you at all. There were hundreds of people who saw me that day, and even a sailor who tried to pick me up in the movie, and yet no one really saw me. If I had tried to check into a hotel the desk clerk might have noticed me, or if I had tried to get dinner in some fancy restaurant in that cheap raincoat I would have been conspicuous, but I was doing what any other girl looking like me and dressed like me might be doing that day. The only person who might be apt to remember me would be the man selling tickets in the railroad station, because girls looking like me in old raincoats didn't buy train tickets, usually, at eleven at night, but I had thought of that, too, of course; I bought a ticket to Amityville, sixty miles away, and what made Amityville a perfectly reasonable disguise is that at Amityville there is a college, not a little fancy place like the one I had left so recently with nobody's blessing, but a big sprawling friendly affair, where my raincoat would look perfectly at home. I told myself I was a student coming back to the college after a week end at home. We got to Amityville after midnight, but it still didn't look odd when I left the train and went into the station, because while I was in the station, having a cup of coffee and killing time, seven other girls—I counted—wearing raincoats like mine came in or went out, not seeming to think it the least bit odd to be getting on or off trains at that hour of the night. Some of them had suitcases, and I wished that I had had some way of getting a suitcase in Crain, but it would have made me noticeable in the movie, and college girls going home for weekends often don't bother; they have pajamas and an extra pair of stockings at home, and they drop a toothbrush into one of the pockets of those invaluable raincoats. So I didn't worry about the suitcase then, although I knew I would need one soon. While I was having my coffee I made my own mind change from the idea that I was a college girl coming back after a week end at home to the idea that I was a college girl who was on her way home for a few days; all the time I tried to think as much as possible like what I was pretending to be, and after all, I had been a college girl for a while. I was thinking that even now the letter was in the mail, traveling as fast as the U. S. Government could make it go, right to my father to tell him why I wasn't a college student any more; I suppose that was what finally decided me to run away, the thought of what my father would think and say and do when he got that letter from the college.

That was in the paper, too. They decided that the college business was the reason for my running away, but if that had been all, I don't think I would have left. No, I had been wanting to leave for so long, ever since I can remember, making plans till I was sure they were foolproof, and that's the way they turned out to be.

Sitting there in the station at Amityville, I tried to think myself into a good reason why I was leaving college to go home on a Monday night late, when I would hardly be going home for the week end. As I say, I always tried to think as hard as I could the way that suited whatever I wanted to be, and I liked to have a good reason for what I was doing. Nobody ever asked me, but it was good to know that I could answer them if they did. I finally decided that my sister was getting married the next day and I was going home at the beginning of the week to be one of her bridesmaids. I thought that was funny. I didn't want to be going home for any sad or frightening reason, like my mother being sick, or my father being hurt in a car accident, because I would have to look sad, and that might attract attention. So I was going home for my sister's wedding. I wandered around the station as though I had nothing to do, and just happened to pass the door when another girl was going out; she had on a raincoat just like mine and anyone who happened to notice would have thought that it was me who went out. Before I bought my ticket I went into the ladies' room and got another twenty dollars out of my shoe. I had nearly three hundred dollars left of the money I had taken from my father's desk and I had most of it in my shoes because I honestly couldn't think of another safe place to carry it. All I kept in my pocketbook was just enough for whatever I had to spend next. It's uncomfortable walking around all day on a wad of bills in your shoe, but they were good solid shoes, the kind of comfortable old shoes you wear whenever you don't really care how you look, and I had put new shoelaces in them before I left home so I could tie them good and tight. You can see, I planned pretty carefully, and no little detail got left out. If they had let me plan my sister's wedding there would have been a lot less of that running around and screaming and hysterics.

I bought a ticket to Chandler, which is the biggest city in this part of the state, and the place I'd been heading for all along. It was a good place to hide because people from Rockville tended to bypass it unless they had some special reason for going there—if they couldn't find the doctors or orthodontists or psychoanalysts or dress material they wanted in Rockville or Crain, they went directly to one of the really big cities, like the state capital; Chandler was big enough to hide in, but not big enough to look like a metropolis to people from Rockville. The ticket seller in the Amityville station must have seen a good many college girls buying tickets for Chandler at all hours of the day or night because he took my money and shoved the ticket at me without even looking up.

Funny. They must have come looking for me in Chandler at some time or other, because it's not likely they would have neglected any possible place I might be, but maybe Rockville people never seriously believed that anyone would go to Chandler from choice, because I never felt for a minute that anyone was looking for me there. My picture was in the Chandler papers, of course, but as far as I ever knew no one ever looked at me twice, and I got up every morning and went to work and went shopping in the stores and went to movies with Mrs. Peacock and went out to the beach all that summer without ever being afraid of being recognized. I behaved just like everyone else, and dressed just like everyone else, and even thought just like everyone else, and the only person I ever saw from Rockville in three years was a friend of my mother's, and I knew she only came to Chandler to get her poodle bred at the kennels there. She didn't look as if she was in a state to recognize anybody but another poodle-fancier, anyway, and all I had to do was step into a doorway as she went by, and she never looked at me.

Two other college girls got on the train to Chandler when I did; maybe both of them were going home for their sisters' weddings. Neither of them was wearing a tan raincoat, but one of them had on an old blue jacket that gave the same general effect. I fell asleep as soon as the train started, and once I woke up and for a minute I wondered where I was and then I realized that I was doing it, I was actually carrying out my careful plan and had gotten better than halfway with it, and I almost laughed, there in the train with everyone asleep around me. Then I went back to sleep and didn't wake up until we got into Chandler about seven in the morning.

So there I was. I had left home just after lunch the day before, and now at seven in the morning of my sister's wedding day I was so far away, in every sense, that I knew they would never find me. I had all day to get myself settled in Chandler, so I started off by having breakfast in a restaurant near the station, and then went off to find a place to live, and a job. The first thing I did was buy a suitcase, and it's funny how people don't really notice you if you're buying a suitcase near a railroad station. Suitcases look natural near railroad stations, and I picked out one of those stores that sell a little bit of everything, and bought a cheap suitcase and a pair of stockings and some handkerchiefs and a little traveling clock, and I put everything into the suitcase and carried that. Nothing is hard to do unless you get upset or excited about it.

Later on, when Mrs. Peacock and I used to read in the papers about my disappearing, I asked her once if she thought that Louisa Tether had gotten as far as Chandler and she didn't.

“They're saying now she was kidnapped,” Mrs. Peacock told me, “and that's what I think happened. Kidnapped, and murdered, and they do terrible things to young girls they kidnap.”

“But the papers say there wasn't any ransom note.”

“That's what they say.” Mrs. Peacock shook her head at me. “How do we know what the family is keeping secret? Or if she was kidnapped by a homicidal maniac, why should he send a ransom note? Young girls like you don't know a lot of the things that go on, I can tell you.”

“I feel kind of sorry for the girl,” I said.

“You can't ever tell,” Mrs. Peacock said. “Maybe she went with him willingly.”

I didn't know, that first morning in Chandler, that Mrs. Peacock was going to turn up that first day, the luckiest thing that ever happened to me. I decided while I was having breakfast that I was going to be a nineteen-year-old girl from upstate with a nice family and a good background who had been saving money to come to Chandler and take a secretarial course in the business school there. I was going to have to find some kind of a job to keep on earning money while I went to school; courses at the business school wouldn't start until fall, so I would have the summer to work and save money and decide if I really wanted to take secretarial training. If I decided not to stay in Chandler I could easily go somewhere else after the fuss about my running away had died down. The raincoat looked wrong for the kind of conscientious young girl I was going to be, so I took it off and carried it over my arm. I think I did a pretty good job on my clothes, altogether. Before I left home I decided that I would have to wear a suit, as quiet and unobtrusive as I could find, and I picked out a gray suit, with a white blouse, so with just one or two small changes like a different blouse or some kind of a pin on the lapel, I could look like whoever I decided to be. Now the suit looked absolutely right for a young girl planning to take a secretarial course, and I looked like a thousand other people when I walked down the street carrying my suitcase and my raincoat over my arm; people get off trains every minute looking just like that. I bought a morning paper and stopped in a drugstore for a cup of coffee and a look to see the rooms for rent. It was all so usual—suitcase, coat, rooms for rent—that when I asked the soda clerk how to get to Primrose Street he never even looked at me. He certainly didn't care whether I ever got to Primrose Street or not, but he told me very politely where it was and what bus to take. I didn't really need to take the bus for economy, but it would have looked funny for a girl who was saving money to arrive in a taxi.

“I'll never forget how you looked that first morning,” Mrs. Peacock told me once, much later. “I knew right away you were the kind of girl I like to rent rooms to—quiet, and wellmannered. But you looked almighty scared of the big city.”

“I wasn't scared,” I said. “I was worried about finding a nice room. My mother told me so many things to be careful about I was afraid I'd never find anything to suit her.”

“Anybody's mother could come into my house at any time and know that her daughter was in good hands,” Mrs. Peacock said, a little huffy.

But it was true. When I walked into Mrs. Peacock's rooming house on Primrose Street, and met Mrs. Peacock, I knew that I couldn't have done this part better if I'd been able to plan it. The house was old, and comfortable, and my room was nice, and Mrs. Peacock and I hit it off right away. She was very pleased with me when she heard that my mother had told me to be sure the room I found was clean and that the neighborhood was good, with no chance of rowdies following a girl if she came home after dark, and she was even more pleased when she heard that I wanted to save money and take a secretarial course so I could get a really good job and earn enough to be able to send a little home every week; Mrs. Peacock believed that children owed it to their parents to pay back some of what had been spent on them while they were growing up. By the time I had been in the house an hour Mrs. Peacock knew all about my imaginary family upstate: my mother, who was a widow, and my sister, who had just gotten married and still lived at my mother's home with her husband, and my young brother Paul, who worried my mother a good deal because he didn't seem to want to settle down. My name was Lois Taylor, I told her. By that time, I think I could have told her my real name and she would never have connected it with the girl in the paper, because by then she was feeling that she almost knew my family, and she wanted me to be sure and tell my mother when I wrote home that Mrs. Peacock would make herself personally responsible for me while I was in the city and take as good care of me as my own mother would. On top of everything else, she told me that a stationery store in the neighborhood was looking for a girl assistant, and there I was. Before I had been away from home for twenty-four hours I was an entirely new person. I was a girl named Lois Taylor who lived on Primrose Street and worked down at the stationery store.

I read in the papers one day about how a famous fortuneteller wrote to my father offering to find me and said that astral signs had convinced him that I would be found near flowers. That gave me a jolt, because of Primrose Street, but my father and Mrs. Peacock and the rest of the world thought that it meant that my body was buried somewhere. They dug up a vacant lot near the railroad station where I was last seen, and Mrs. Peacock was very disappointed when nothing turned up. Mrs. Peacock and I could not decide whether I had run away with a gangster to be a gun moll, or whether my body had been cut up and sent somewhere in a trunk. After a while they stopped looking for me, except for an occasional false clue that would turn up in a small story on the back pages of the paper, and Mrs. Peacock and I got interested in the stories about a daring daylight bank robbery in Chicago. When the anniversary of my running away came around, and I realized that I had really been gone for a year, I treated myself to a new hat and dinner downtown, and came home just in time for the evening news broadcast and my mother's voice over the radio.

“Louisa,” she was saying, “please come home.”

“That poor poor woman,” Mrs. Peacock said. “Imagine how she must feel. They say she's never given up hope of finding her little girl alive someday.”

“Do you like my new hat?” I asked her.

I had given up all idea of the secretarial course because the stationery store had decided to expand and include a lending library and a gift shop, and I was now the manager of the gift shop and if things kept on well would someday be running the whole thing; Mrs. Peacock and I talked it over, just as if she had been my mother, and we decided that I would be foolish to leave a good job to start over somewhere else. The money that I had been saving was in the bank, and Mrs. Peacock and I thought that one of these days we might pool our savings and buy a little car, or go on a trip somewhere, or even a cruise.

What I am saying is that I was free, and getting along fine, with never a thought that I knew about ever going back. It was just plain rotten bad luck that I had to meet Paul. I had gotten so I hardly ever thought about any of them any more, and never wondered what they were doing unless I happened to see some item in the papers, but there must have been something in the back of my mind remembering them all the time because I never even stopped to think; I just stood there on the street with my mouth open, and said “Paul!” He turned around and then of course I realized what I had done, but it was too late. He stared at me for a minute, and then frowned, and then looked puzzled; I could see him first trying to remember, and then trying to believe what he remembered; at last he said, “Is it possible?”

He said I had to go back. He said if I didn't go back he would tell them where to come and get me. He also patted me on the head and told me that there was still a reward waiting there in the bank for anyone who turned up with conclusive news of me, and he said that after he had collected the reward I was perfectly welcome to run away again, as far and as often as I liked.

Maybe I did want to go home. Maybe all that time I had been secretly waiting for a chance to get back; maybe that's why I recognized Paul on the street, in a coincidence that wouldn't have happened once in a million years—he had never even been to Chandler before, and was only there for a few minutes between trains; he had stepped out of the station for a minute, and found me. If I had not been passing at that minute, if he had stayed in the station where he belonged, I would never have gone back. I told Mrs. Peacock I was going home to visit my family upstate. I thought that was funny.

Paul sent a telegram to my mother and father, saying that he had found me, and we took a plane back; Paul said he was still afraid that I'd try to get away again and the safest place for me was high up in the air where he knew I couldn't get off and run.

I began to get nervous, looking out the taxi window on the way from the Rockville airport; I would have sworn that for three years I hadn't given a thought to that town, to those streets and stores and houses I used to know so well, but here I found that I remembered it all, as though I hadn't ever seen Chandler and its houses and streets; it was almost as though I had never been away at all. When the taxi finally turned the corner into my own street, and I saw the big old white house again, I almost cried.

“Of course I wanted to come back,” I said, and Paul laughed. I thought of the return-trip ticket I had kept as a lucky charm for so long, and how I had thrown it away one day when I was emptying my pocketbook; I wondered when I threw it away whether I would ever want to go back and regret throwing away my ticket. “Everything looks just the same,” I said. “I caught the bus right there on the corner; I came down the driveway that day and met you.”

“If I had managed to stop you that day,” Paul said, “you would probably never have tried again.”

Then the taxi stopped in front of the house and my knees were shaking when I got out. I grabbed Paul's arm and said, “Paul... wait a minute,” and he gave me a look I used to know very well, a look that said “If you back out on me now I'll I see that you never forget it,” and put his arm around me because I was shivering and we went up the walk to the front door.

I wondered if they were watching us from the window. It was hard for me to imagine how my mother and father would behave in a situation like this, because they always made such a point of being quiet and dignified and proper; I thought that Mrs. Peacock would have been halfway down the walk to meet us, but here the front door ahead was still tight shut. I wondered if we would have to ring the doorbell; I had never had to ring this doorbell before. I was still wondering when Carol opened the door for us. “Carol!” I said. I was shocked because she looked so old, and then I thought that of course it had been three years since I had seen her and she probably thought that I looked older, too. “Carol,” I said, “Oh, Carol!” I was honestly glad to see her.

She looked at me hard and then stepped back and my mother and father were standing there, waiting for me to come in. If I had not stopped to think I would have run to them, but I hesitated, not quite sure what to do, or whether they were angry with me, or hurt, or only just happy that I was back, and of course once I stopped to think about it all I could find to do was just stand there and say “Mother?” kind of uncertainly.

She came over to me and put her hands on my shoulders and looked into my face for a long time. There were tears running down her cheeks and I thought that before, when it didn't matter, I had been ready enough to cry, but now, when crying would make me look better, all I wanted to do was giggle. She looked old, and sad, and I felt simply foolish. Then she turned to Paul and said, “Oh, Paul—how can you do this to me again?”

Paul was frightened; I could see it. “Mrs. Tether—” he said.

“What is your name, dear?” my mother asked me.

“Louisa Tether,” I said stupidly.

“No, dear,” she said, very gently, “your real name?”

Now I could cry, but now I did not think it was going to help matters any. “Louisa Tether,” I said. “That's my name.”

“Why don't you people leave us alone?” Carol said; she was white, and shaking, and almost screaming because she was so angry. “We've spent years and years trying to find my lost sister and all people like you see in it is a chance to cheat us out of the reward—doesn't it mean anything to you that you may think you have a chance for some easy money, but we just get hurt and heartbroken all over again? Why don't you leave us alone?”

“Carol,” my father said, “you're frightening the poor child. Young lady,” he said to me, “I honestly believe that you did not realize the cruelty of what you tried to do. You look like a nice girl; try to imagine your own mother—”

I tried to imagine my own mother; I looked straight at her.

“—if someone took advantage of her like this. I am sure you were not told that twice before, this young man—” I stopped looking at my mother and looked at Paul—“has brought us young girls who pretended to be our lost daughter; each time he protested that he had been genuinely deceived and had no thought of profit, and each time we hoped desperately that it would be the right girl. The first time we were taken in for several days. The girl looked like our Louisa, she acted like our Louisa, she knew all kinds of small family jokes and happenings it seemed impossible that anyone but Louisa could know, and yet she was an imposter. And the girl's mother—my wife—has suffered more each time her hopes have been raised.” He put his arm around my mother—his wife—and with Carol they stood all together looking at me.

“Look,” Paul said wildly, “give her a chance—she knows she's Louisa. At least give her a chance to prove it.”

“How?” Carol asked. “I'm sure if I asked her something like—well—like what was the color of the dress she was supposed to wear at my wedding—”

“It was pink,” I said. “I wanted blue but you said it had to be pink.”

“I'm sure she'd know the answer,” Carol went on as though I hadn't said anything. “The other girls you brought here, Paul—they both knew.”

It wasn't going to be any good. I ought to have known it. Maybe they were so used to looking for me by now that they would rather keep on looking than have me home; maybe once my mother had looked in my face and seen there nothing of Louisa, but only the long careful concentration I had put into being Lois Taylor, there was never any chance of my looking like Louisa again.

I felt kind of sorry for Paul; he had never understood them as I well as I did and he clearly felt there was still some chance of talking them into opening their arms and crying out “Louisa! Our long-lost daughter!” and then turning around and handing him the reward; after that, we could all live happily ever after. While Paul was still trying to argue with my father I walked over a little way and looked into the living room again; I figured I wasn't going to have much time to look around and I wanted one last glimpse to take away with me; sister Carol kept a good eye on me all the time, too. I wondered what the two girls before me had tried to steal, and I wanted to tell her that if I ever planned to steal anything from that house I was three years too late; I could have taken whatever I wanted when I left the first time. There was nothing there I could take now, any more than there had been before. I realized that all I wanted was to stay—I wanted to stay so much that I felt like hanging onto the stair rail and screaming, but even though a temper tantrum might bring them some fleeting recollection of their dear lost Louisa I hardly thought it would persuade them to invite me to stay. I could just picture myself being dragged kicking and screaming out of my own house.

“Such a lovely old house,” I said politely to my sister Carol, who was hovering around me.

“Our family has lived here for generations,” she said, just as politely.

“Such beautiful furniture,” I said.

“My mother is fond of antiques.”

“Fingerprints,” Paul was shouting. We were going to get a lawyer, I gathered, or at least Paul thought we were going to get a lawyer and I wondered how he was going to feel when he found out that we weren't. I couldn't imagine any lawyer in the world who could get my mother and my father and my sister Carol to take me back when they had made up their minds that I was not Louisa; could the law make my mother look into my face and recognize me?

I thought that there ought to be some way I could make Paul see that there was nothing we could do, and I came over and stood next to him. “Paul,” I said, “can't you see that you're only making Mr. Tether angry?”

“Correct, young woman,” my father said, and nodded at me to show that he thought I was being a sensible creature. “He's not doing himself any good by threatening me.”

“Paul,” I said, “these people don't want us here.”

Paul started to say something and then for the first time in his life thought better of it and stamped off toward the door. When I turned to follow him—thinking that we'd never gotten past the front hall in my great homecoming—my father—excuse me, Mr. Tether—came up behind me and took my hand. “My daughter was younger than you are,” he said to me very kindly. “but I'm sure you have a family somewhere who love you and want you to be happy. Go back to them, young lady. Let me advise you as though I were really your father—stay away from that fellow, he's wicked and he's worthless. Go back home where you belong.”

“We know what it's like for a family to worry and wonder about a daughter,” my mother said. “Go back to the people who love you.”

That meant Mrs. Peacock, I guess.

“Just to make sure you get there,” my father said, “let us help toward your fare.” I tried to take my hand away, but he put a folded bill into it and I had to take it. “I hope someday,” he said, “that someone will do as much for our Louisa.”

“Good-by, my dear,” my mother said, and she reached up and patted my cheek. “Very good luck to you.”

“I hope your daughter comes back someday,” I told them. “Good-by.”

The bill was a twenty, and I gave it to Paul. It seemed little enough for all the trouble he had taken and, after all, I could go back to my job in the stationery store. My mother still talks to me on the radio, once a year, on the anniversary of the day I ran away.

“Louisa,” she says, “please come home. We all want our dear girl back, and we need you and miss you so much. Your mother and father love you and will never forget you. Louisa, please come home.”





The Little House


I'll have to get some decent lights, was her first thought,and her second: and a dog or something, or at least a bird, anything alive. She stood in the little hall beside her suitcase, in a little house that belonged to her, her first home. She held the front-door key in her hand, and she knew, remembering her aunt, that the back-door key hung, labeled, from a hook beside the back door, and the side-door key hung from a hook beside the side door, and the porch-door key hung from a hook beside the porch door, and the cellar-door key hung from a hook beside the cellar door, and perhaps when she slammed the front door behind her all the keys swung gently, once, back and forth. Anything that can move and make some kind of a friendly noise, she thought, maybe a monkey or a cat or anything not stuffed—as she realized that she was staring, hypnotized, at the moose head over the hall mirror.

Wanting to make some kind of a noise in the silence, she coughed, and the small sound moved dustily into the darkness of the house. Well, I'm here, she told herself, and it belongs to me and I can do anything I want here and no one can ever make me leave, because it's mine. She moved to touch the carved newel post at the foot of the narrow stairway—it was hers, it belonged to her—and felt a sudden joy at the tangible reality of the little house; this is really something to own, she thought, thank you, Aunt. And my goodness, she thought, brushing her hand, couldn't my very own house do with a little dusting; she smiled to herself at the prospect of the very pleasant work she would do tomorrow and the day after, and for all the days after that, living in her house and keeping it clean and fresh.

Wanting to whistle, to do something to bring noise and movement into the house, she turned and opened the door on her right and stepped into the dim crowded parlor. I wish I didn't have to see it first at dusk, she thought, Aunt certainly didn't believe in bright light; I wonder how she ever found her way around this room. A dim shape on a low table beside the door resolved itself into a squat lamp; when she pressed the switch a low radiance came into the room and she was able to leave the spot by the door and venture into what had clearly been her aunt's favorite room. The parlor had certainly not been touched, or even opened or lighted, since her aunt's death; a tea towel, half-hemmed, lay on the arm of a chair, and she felt a sudden tenderness and a half-shame at the thought of the numbers of tea towels, hemmed, which had come to her at birthdays and Christmases over the years and now lay still in their tissue paper, at the bottom of her trunk still at the railroad station. At least I'll use her towels now, in her own house, she thought, and then: but it's my house now. She would stack the tea towels neatly in the linen closet, she might even finish hemming this one, and she took it up and folded it neatly, leaving the needle still tucked in where her aunt had left it, to await the time when she should sit quietly in her chair, in her parlor in her house, and take up her sewing. Her aunt's glasses lay on the table; had her aunt put down her sewing and taken off her glasses at the very end? Prepared, neatly, to die?

Don't think about it, she told herself sternly, she's gone now, and soon the house will be busy again; I'll clear away tomorrow, when it's not so dark; how did she ever manage to sew in here with this light? She put the half-hemmed towel over the glasses to hide them, and took up a little picture in a silver frame; her aunt, she recognized, and some smiling woman friend, standing together under trees; this must have been important to Aunt, she thought, I'll put it away safely somewhere. The house was distantly familiar to her; she had come here sometimes as a child, but that was long ago, and the memories of the house and her aunt were overlaid with cynicism and melancholy and the wearying disappointments of many years; perhaps it was the longing to return to the laughter of childhood which had brought her here so eagerly to take up her inheritance. The music box was in the corner where it had always been and, touching it gently, she brought from it one remote, faintly sweet, jangle of a note. Tomorrow I'll play the music box, she promised herself, with the windows wide open and the good fresh air blowing through and all the bric-a-brac safely stowed away in the attic; this could be such a pretty room—and she turned, her head to one side, considering—once I take out the junk and the clutter. I can keep the old couch and maybe have it recovered in something colorful, and the big chair can stay, and perhaps one or two of these tiny tables; the mantel is fine, and I'll keep a bowl of flowers there, flowers from my own garden. I'll have a great fire in the fireplace and I'll sit here with my dog and my needlework—and two or three good floor lamps; I'll get those tomorrow—and never be unhappy again. Tomorrow, lamps, and air the room, and play the music box.

Leaving a dim trail of lighted lamps behind her, she went from the parlor through a little sunporch where a magazine lay open on the table; Aunt never finished the story she was reading, she thought, and closed the magazine quickly and set it in order on the pile on the table; I'll subscribe to magazines, she thought, and the local newspaper, and take books from the village library. From the sunporch she went into the kitchen and remembered to turn on the light by pulling the cord hanging from the middle of the ceiling; her aunt had left a tomato ripening on the window sill, and it scented the kitchen with a strong air of decay. She shivered, and realized that the back door was standing open, and remembered her aunt saying, as clearly as though she heard it now, “Darn that door, I wish I could remember to get that latch looked at.”

And now I have to do it for her, she thought; I'll get a man in the morning. She found a paper bag in the pantry drawer where paper bags had always been kept, and scraped the rotten tomato from the window sill and carried the bag to the garbage pail by the back steps. When she came back she slammed the back door correctly and the latch caught; the key was hanging where she knew it had been, beside the door, and she took it down and locked the door; I'm alone in the house, after all, she thought with a little chill touching the back of her neck.

The cup from which her aunt had drunk her last cup of tea lay, washed and long since drained dry, beside the sink; perhaps she put her sewing down, she thought, and came to the kitchen to make a cup of tea before going to bed; I wonder where they found her; she always had a cup of tea at night, all alone; I wish I had come to see her at least once. The lovely old dishes are mine now, she thought, the family dishes and the cut glass and the silver tea service. Her aunt's sweater hung from the knob of the cellar door, as though she had only just this minute taken it off, and her apron hung from a hook beside the sink. Aunt always put things away, she thought, and she never came back for her sweater. She remembered dainty little hand-embroidered aprons in the hall chest, and thought of herself, aproned, serving a charming tea from the old tea service, using the thin painted cups, perhaps to neighbors who had come to see her delightful, open, light, little house; I must have a cocktail party too, she thought; I'll bet there's nothing in the house but dandelion wine.

It would seem strange at first, coming downstairs in the morning to make herself breakfast in her aunt's kitchen, and she suddenly remembered herself, very small, eating oatmeal at the kitchen table; it would seem strange to be using her aunt's dishes, and the big old coffeepot—although perhaps not the coffeepot, she thought; it had the look of something crotchety and temperamental, not willing to submit docilely to a strange hand; I'll have tea tomorrow morning, and get a new little coffeepot just for me. Lamps, coffeepot, man to fix the latch.

After a moment's thought she took her aunt's sweater and apron and bundled them together and carried them out to the garbage pail. It isn't as though they were any good to anyone, she told herself reassuringly; all her clothes will have to be thrown away, and she pictured herself standing in her bright parlor in her smart city clothes telling her laughing friends about the little house; “Well, you should have seen it when I came,” she would tell them, “you should have seen the place the first night I walked in. Murky little lamps, and the place simply crawling with bric-a-brac, and a stuffed moose head—really, a stuffed moose head, I mean it—and Aunt's sewing on the table, and what was positively her last cup in the sink.” Will I tell them, she wondered, about how Aunt set her sewing down when she was ready to die? And never finished her magazine, and hung up her sweater, and felt her heart go? “You should have seen it when I came,” she would tell them, sipping from her glass, “dark, and dismal; I used to come here when I was a child, but I honestly never remembered it as such a mess. It couldn't have come as more of a surprise, her leaving me the house, I never dreamed of having it.”

Suddenly guilty, she touched the cold coffeepot with a gentle finger. I'll clean you tomorrow, she thought; I'm sorry I never got to the funeral, I should have tried to come. Tomorrow I'll start cleaning. Then she whirled, startled, at the knock at the back door; I hadn't realized it was so quiet here, she thought, and breathed again and moved quickly to the door. “Who is it?” she said. “Just a minute.” Her hands shaking, she unlocked and opened the door. “Who is it?” she said into the darkness, and then smiled timidly at the two old faces regarding her. “Oh,” she said, “how do you do?”

“You'll be the niece? Miss Elizabeth?”

“Yes.” Two old pussycats, she thought, wearing hats with flowers, couldn't wait to get a look at me. “Hello,” she said, thinking, I'm the charming niece Elizabeth, and this is my house now.

“We are the Dolson sisters. I am Miss Amanda Dolson. This is my sister Miss Caroline Dolson.”

“We're your nearest neighbors.” Miss Caroline put a thin brown hand on Elizabeth's sleeve. “We live down the lane. We were your poor poor aunt's nearest neighbors. But we didn't hear anything.”

Miss Amanda moved a little forward and Elizabeth stepped back. “Won't you come in?” Elizabeth asked, remembering her manners. “Come into the parlor. I was just looking at the house. I only just got here,” she said, moving backward, “I was just turning on some lights.”

“We saw the lights.” Miss Amanda went unerringly toward the little parlor. “This is not our formal call, you understand; we pay our calls by day. But I confess we wondered at the lights.”

“We thought he had come back.” Miss Caroline's hand was on Elizabeth's sleeve again, as though she were leading Elizabeth to the parlor. “They say they do, you know.”

Miss Amanda seated herself, as though by right of long acquaintance, on the soft chair by the low table, and Miss Caroline took the only other comfortable chair; my own house indeed, Elizabeth thought, and sat down uneasily on a stiff chair near the door; I must get lamps first thing tomorrow; she thought, the better to see people with.

“Have you lived here long?” she asked foolishly.

“I hope you don't plan to change things,” Miss Amanda said. “Aunt loved her little house, you know.”

“I haven't had much time to plan.”

“You'll find everything just the way she left it. I myself took her pocketbook upstairs and put it into the drawer of the commode. Otherwise nothing has been touched. Except the body, of course.”

Oh, that's not still here? she wanted to ask, but said instead, “I used to come here when I was a child.”

“So he wasn't after her money,” Miss Caroline said. “Sister took her pocketbook off the kitchen table; I saw her do it. She took it upstairs and nothing was missing.”

Miss Amanda leaned a little forward. “You'll be bringing in television sets? From the city? Radios?”

“I hadn't thought much about it yet.”

“We'll be able to hear your television set, no doubt. We are your closest neighbors and we see your lights; no doubt your television set will be very loud.”

“We would have heard if she had screamed,” Miss Caroline said, lifting her thin hand in emphasis. “They say she must have recognized him, and indeed it is my belief that Sheriff Knowlton has a very shrewd notion who he is. It is my belief that we all have our suspicions.”

“Sister, this is gossip. Miss Elizabeth detests gossip.”

“We were here the first thing in the morning, Miss Elizabeth, and I spoke to the Sheriff myself.”

“Sister, Miss Elizabeth does not trouble her mind with wild stories. Let Miss Elizabeth remember Aunt as happy.”

“I don't understand.” Elizabeth looked from one of the tight old faces to the other; the two old bats, she thought, and said, “My aunt died of a heart attack, they said.”

“It is my belief—”

“My sister is fond of gossip, Miss Elizabeth. I suppose you'll be packing away all of Aunt's pretty things?”

Elizabeth glanced at the table near her. A pink china box, a glass paperweight, a crocheted doily on which rested a set of blue porcelain kittens. “Some of them,” she said.

“To make room for the television set. Poor Aunt; she thought a good deal of her small possessions.” She frowned. “You won't find an ash tray in here.”

Elizabeth put her cigarette down defiantly on the lid of the small pink box.

“Sister,” Miss Amanda said, “bring Miss Elizabeth a saucer from the kitchen, from the daily china. Not the floral set.”

Miss Caroline, looking shocked, hurried from the room, holding her heavy skirt away from the tables and Elizabeth's cigarette. Miss Amanda leaned forward again. “I do not permit my sister to gossip, Miss Elizabeth. You are wrong to encourage her.”

“But what is she trying to say about my aunt?”

“Aunt has been dead and buried for two months. You were not, I think, at the funeral?”

“I couldn't get away.”

“From the city. Exactly. I daresay you were delighted to have the house.”

“Indeed I was.”

“I suppose Aunt could hardly have done otherwise. Sister, give Miss Elizabeth the saucer. Quickly, before the room catches fire.”

“Thank you.” Elizabeth took the chipped saucer from Miss Caroline and put out her cigarette; ash trays, she thought, lamps, ash trays, coffeepot.

“Her apron is gone,” Miss Caroline told her sister.

“Already?” Miss Amanda turned to look fully at Elizabeth. “I am afraid we will see many changes, Sister. And now Miss Elizabeth is waiting for us to leave. Miss Elizabeth is determined to begin her packing tonight.”

“Really,” Elizabeth said helplessly, gesturing, “really—”

“All of Aunt's pretty things. This is not our formal call, Miss Elizabeth.” Miss Amanda rose grandly, and Miss Caroline followed. “You will see us within three days. Poor Aunt.”

Elizabeth followed them back to the kitchen, “Really,” she said again, and “Please don't leave,” but Miss Amanda overrode her.

“This door does not latch properly,” Miss Amanda said. “See that it is securely locked behind us.”

“They say that's how he got in,” Miss Caroline whispered. “Keep it locked always.”

“Good night, Miss Elizabeth. I am happy to know that you plan to keep the house well lighted. We see your lights, you know, from our windows.”

“Good night,” Miss Caroline said, turning to put her hand once more on Elizabeth's arm. “Locked, remember.”

“Good night,” Elizabeth said, “good night.” Old bats, she was thinking, old bats. Sooner or later I'm going to have words with them; they're probably the pests of the neighborhood. She watched as they went side by side down the path, their heads not yet turned to one another, their long skirts swinging. “Good night,” she called once more, but neither of them turned. Old bats, she thought, and slammed the door correctly; the latch caught, and she took down the key and locked it. I'll give them the moose head, she thought, my aunt would have wanted them to have it. It's late, I've got to find myself a bed, I haven't even been upstairs yet. I'll give them each a piece of the junk; my very own, my pretty little house.

Humming happily, she turned back toward the parlor; I wonder where they found her? she thought suddenly; was it in the parlor? She stopped in the doorway, staring at the soft chair and wondering: did he come up behind her there? While she was sewing? And then pick up her glasses from the floor and set them on the table? Perhaps she was reading her magazine when he caught her, perhaps she had just washed her cup and saucer and was turning back to get her sweater; would it have been this quiet in the house? Is it always this quiet?

“No, no,” she said aloud. “This is silly. Tomorrow I'll get a dog.”

Pressing her lips together firmly, she walked across the room and turned off the light, then came back and turned off the lamp beside the door, and the soft darkness fell around her; did they find her here? she wondered as she went through the sunporch, and then said aloud “This is silly,” and turned off the light. With the darkness following close behind her she came back to the kitchen and checked that the back door was securely locked. He won't get in here again, she thought, and shivered.

There was no light on the stairs. I can leave the kitchen light on all night, she thought, but no; they'll see it from their windows; did he wait for her on the stairs? Pressing against the wall, the kitchen light still burning dimly behind her, she went up the stairs, staring into the darkness, feeling her way with her feet. At the top was only darkness, and she put out her hands blindly; there was a wall, and then a door, and she ran her hand down the side of the door until she had the doorknob in her fingers.

What's waiting behind the door? she thought, and turned and fled wildly down the stairs and into the lighted kitchen with the locked back door. “Don't leave me here alone,” she said, turning to look behind her, “please don't leave me here alone.”




Miss Amanda and Miss Caroline cuddled on either side of their warm little stove. Miss Amanda had a piece of fruitcake and a cup of tea and Miss Caroline had a piece of marshmallow cake and a cup of tea. “Just the same,” Miss Caroline was saying, “she should have served something.”

“City ways.”

“She could have offered some of the city cake she brought with her. The coffeepot was right there in the kitchen. It's not polite to wait until the company goes and then eat by yourself.”

“It's city ways, Sister. I doubt she'll be a good neighbor for us.”

“Her aunt would not have done it.”

“When I think of her searching that little house for valuables I feel very sorry for Aunt.”

Miss Caroline set down her plate, and nodded to herself. “She might not like it here,” she said. “Perhaps she won't stay.”





Pajama Party


It was planned by Jannie herself. I was won over reluctantly, by much teasing and promises of supernatural good behavior; as a matter of fact Jannie even went so far as to say that if she could have a pajama party she would keep her room picked up for one solid month, a promise so far beyond the realms of possibility that I could only believe that she wanted the pajama party more than anything else in the world. My husband thought it was a mistake. “You are making a terrible, an awful mistake,” he said to me. “And don't try to say I didn't tell you so.” My older son Laurie told me it was a mistake. “Man,” he said, “this you will regret. For the rest of your life you will be saying to yourself ‘Why did I let that dopey girl ever ever have a pajama party that night?’ For the rest of your life. When you're an old lady you will be saying—”

“What can I do?” I said. “I promised.” We were all at the breakfast table, and it was seven-thirty on the morning of Jannie's eleventh birthday. Jannie sat unhearing, her spoon poised blissfully over her cereal, her eyes dreamy with speculation over what was going to turn up in the packages to be presented that evening after dinner. Her list of wanted birthday presents had included a live pony, a pair of roller skates, highheeled shoes of her very own, a make-up kit with real lipstick, a record player and records, and a dear little monkey to play with, and any or all of these things might be in the offing. She sighed, and set down her spoon, and sighed.

“You know of course,” Laurie said to me, “I have the room right next to her? I'm going to be sleeping in there like I do every night? You know I'm going to be in my bed trying to sleep?”He shuddered. “Giggle,” he said. “Giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle, giggle. Two, three o'clock in the morning—giggle giggle giggle. A human being can't bear it.”

Jannie focused her eyes on him. “Why don't we burn up this boy's birth certificate?”she asked.

“Giggle, giggle,” Laurie said.

Barry spoke, waving his toast. “When Jannie gets her birthday presents can I play with it?” he asked. “If I am very very careful can I please play with just the—”

Everyone began to talk at once to drown him out. “Giggle, giggle,” Laurie shouted. “Don't say I didn't warn you,” my husband said loudly. “Anyway I promised,” I said. “Happy birthday dear sister,” Sally sang. Jannie giggled.

“There,” Laurie said. “You hear her?All night long—five of them.”Shaking his head as one who has been telling them and telling them and telling them not to bring that wooden horse through the gates of Troy, he stamped off to get his schoolbooks and his trumpet. Jannie sighed happily. Barry opened his mouth to speak and his father and Sally and I all said“Shhh.”

Jannie had to be excused from her cereal, because she was too excited to eat. It was a cold frosty morning, and I forced the girls into their winter coats and warm hats, and put Barry into his snow suit. Laurie, who believes that he is impervious to cold, came downstairs, said, “Mad, I tell you, mad,” sympathetically to me, “'By, cat,” to his father, and went out the back door toward his bike, ignoring my frantic insistence that he put on some kind of a jacket or at least a sweater.

I checked that teeth had been brushed, hair combed, handkerchiefs secured, told the girls to hold Barry's hand crossing the street, told Barry to hold the girls'hands crossing the street, put Barry's mid-morning cookies into his jacket pocket, reminded Jannie for the third time about her spelling book, held the dogs so they could not get out when the door was opened, told everyone good-by and happy birthday again to Jannie, and watched from the kitchen window while they made their haphazard way down the driveway,lingering, chatting, stopping to point to things. I opened the door once more to call to them to move along, they would be late for school, and they disregarded me. I called to hurry up, and for a minute they moved more quickly, hopping, and then came to the end of the driveway and onto the sidewalk where they merged at once into the general traffic going to school, the collection of red hoods and blue jackets and plaid caps that goes past every morning and comes past again at noontime and goes back after lunch and returns at last, lingering, at three o'clock. I came back to the table and sat down wearily, reaching for the coffeepot. “Five of them are too many,” my husband explained. “One would have been quite enough.”

“You can't have a pajama party with just one guest,” I said sullenly. “And anyway no matter who she invited the other three would have been offended.”

By lunchtime I had set up four cots, two of them borrowed from a neighbor who was flatly taken aback when she heard what I wanted them for. “I think you must be crazy,” she said. Jannie's bedroom is actually two rooms, one small and one, which she calls her library because her bookcase is in there, much larger. I put one cot in her bedroom next to her bed, which left almost no room in there to move around. The other three cots I lined up in her library, making a kind of dormitory effect. Beyond Jannie's library is the guest room, and all the bedrooms except Laurie's are on the other side of the guest room. Laurie's room is separated by only the thinnest wall from Jannie's library. I used all my colored sheets and flowered pillowcases to make up the five beds, and every extra blanket in the house; I finally had to use the pillows from the couch.

When Jannie came home from school I made her lie down and rest, pointing out in one of the most poignant understatements of my life that she would probably be up late that night. In fifteen minutes she was downstairs asking if she could get dressed for her party. I said her party was not going to start until eight o'clock and to take an apple and go lie down again. In another ten minutes she was down to explain that she would probably be too excited to dress later and it would really be only common sense to put her party dress on now. I said if she came downstairs again before dinner was on the table I would personally call her four guests and cancel the pajama party. She finally rested for half an hour or so in the chair by the upstairs phone, talking to her friend Carole.

She was of course unable to eat her dinner, although she had chosen the menu. She nibbled at a piece of lamb, rearranged her mashed potatoes, and told her father and me that she could not understand how we had endured as many birthdays as we had. Her father said that he personally had gotten kind of used to them, and that as a matter of fact a certain quality of excitement did seem to go out of them after—say—thirty, and Jannie sighed unbelievingly.

“One more birthday like this would kill her,” Laurie said. He groaned. “Carole,” he said, as one telling over a fearful list, “Kate. Laura. Linda, Jannie. You must be crazy,” he said to me.

“I suppose your friends are so much?” Jannie said. “I suppose Ernie didn't get sent down to Miss Corcoran's office six times today for throwing paper wads? I suppose Charlie—”

“You didn't seem to think Charlie was so bad, walking home from school,” Laurie said. “I guess that wasn't you walking with—”

Jannie turned pink. “Does my own brother have any right to insult me on my own birthday?” she asked her father.

In honor of Jannie's birthday Sally helped me clear the table, and Jannie sat in state with her hands folded, waiting. When the table was cleared we left Jannie there alone, and assembled in the study. While my husband lighted the candles on the pink-and-white cake, Sally and Barry took from the back of the closet the gifts they had chosen themselves and lovingly wrapped. Barry's gift was clearly a leathercraft set, since his most careful wrapping had been unable to make the paper go right round the box, and the name showed clearly. Sally had three books. Laurie had an album of records he had chosen himself. (“This is for my sister,” he had told the clerk in the music store, most earnestly, with an Elvis Presley record in each hand, “for my sister—not me, my sister.”) Laurie also had to carry the little blue record player which my husband and I had decided was a more suitable gift for our elder daughter than a dear little monkey or even a pair of high-heeled shoes. I carried the boxes from the two sets of grandparents, one holding a flowered quilted skirt and a fancy blouse, and the other holding a stiff crinoline petticoat. With the cake leading, we filed into the dining room where Jannie sat. “Happy birthday to you,” we sang, and Jannie looked once and then leaped past us to the phone. “Be there in a minute,” she said, and then, “Carole? Carole, listen, I got it, the record player. 'By.”

By a quarter to eight Jannie was dressed in the new blouse and skirt, over the petticoat, Barry was happily taking apart the leathercraft set, the record player had been plugged in and we had heard, more or less involuntarily, four sides of Elvis Presley. Laurie had shut himself in his room, dissociating himself utterly from the festivities. “I was willing to buy them,” he explained, “I even spent good money out of the bank, but no one can make me listen.”

I took a card table up to Jannie's room and squeezed it in among the beds; on it I put a pretty cloth and a bowl of apples, a small dish of candy, a plate of decorated cupcakes, and an ice bucket in which were five bottles of grape soda imbedded in ice. Jannie brought her record player upstairs and put it on the table and Laurie plugged it in for her on condition that she would not turn it on until he was safely back in his room. With what Laurie felt indignantly was an absolute and complete disregard for the peace of mind and healthy sleep of a cherished older son I put a deck of fortunetelling cards on the table, and a book on the meaning of dreams.

Everything was ready, and Jannie and her father and I were sitting apprehensively in the living room when the first guest came. It was Laura. She was dressed in a blue party dress, and she brought Jannie a charm bracelet which Jannie put on. Then Carole and Linda arrived together, one wearing a green party dress and the other a fancy blouse and skirt, like Jannie. They all admired Jannie's new blouse and skirt, and one of them had brought her a book and the other had brought a dress and hat for her doll. Kate came almost immediately afterward. She was wearing a wide skirt like Jannie's, and she had a crinoline, too. She and Jannie compared crinolines, and each of them insisted that the other's was much, much prettier. Kate had brought Jannie a pocketbook with a penny inside for luck. All the girls carried overnight bags but Kate, who had a small suitcase. “You'll think I'm going to stay for a month, the stuff I brought,” she said, and I felt my husband shudder.

Each of the girls complimented, individually, each item of apparel on each of the others. It was conceded that Jannie's skirt, which came from California, was of a much more advanced style than skirts obtainable in Vermont. The pocketbook was a most fortunate choice, they agreed, because it perfectly matched the little red flowers in Jannie's skirt. Laura's shoes were the prettiest anyone had ever seen. Linda's party dress was of orlon, which all of them simply adored. Linda said if she did say it herself, the ruffles never got limp. Carole was wearing a necklace which no one could possibly tell was not made of real pearls. Linda said that we had the nicest house, she was always telling her mother and father that she wished they had one just like it. My husband said we would sell any time. Kate said our dogs were just darling, and Laura said she loved that green chair. I said somewhat ungraciously that they had all of them spent a matter of thousands of hours in our house and the green chair was no newer or prettier than it had been the last time Laura was here, when she was bouncing up and down on the seat. Jannie said hastily that there were cupcakes and Elvis Presley records up in her room, and they were gone. They went up the back stairs like a troop of horses, saying “Cupcakes, cupcakes.”

Sally and Barry were in bed, but permitted to stay awake because it was Friday night and Jannie's birthday. Barry had taken Jannie's leathercraft set up to his room, planning to make his dear sister a pair of moccasins. Because Sally and Barry were not invited to the party I took them each a tray with one cupcake, a glass of fruit juice, and three candies. Sally asked if she could play her phonograph while she read fairy tales and ate her cupcake and I said certainly, since in the general air of excitement prevailing I did not think that even Barry would fall asleep for a while yet. As I started downstairs Barry called after me to ask if he could play his phonograph and of course I could hardly say no.

When I got downstairs my husband had settled down to reading freshman themes in the living room. “Everything seems...” he said; I believe he was going to finish “quiet,” but Elvis Presley started then from Jannie's room. There was a howl of fury from Laurie's room, and then his phonograph started; to answer Elvis Presley he had chosen an old Louis Armstrong record, and he was holding his own. From the front of the house upstairs drifted down the opening announcement of “Peter and the Wolf,” from Sally, and then, distantly, from Barry's room the crashing chords which heralded (blast off!) “Space Men on the Moon.”

“What did you say?” I asked my husband.

“Oh, when the saints, come marching in...”

“I said it seemed quiet,” my husband yelled.

“The cat, by a clarinet in a loooow register...”

“I want you, I need you...”

“Prepare for blast: five—four—three—two—”

“I want to be in their number...”

“It sure does,” I yelled back.

“Boom.” Barry's rocket was in space.

Barry took control for a minute, because he can sing every word of (blast off!) “Space Men on the Moon,” but then the wolf came pacing up to Peter's gate, Jannie switched to “Blue Suede Shoes,” and Laurie took out his trumpet. He played without a mute, ordinarily forbidden in the house, so for a few minutes he was definitely ascendant, even though a certain undeniable guitar beat intruded from Jannie, but then Jannie and her guests began to sing and Laurie faltered, lost the Saints, fell irresistibly into “Blue Suede Shoes,” cursed, picked up the Saints, and finally conceded defeat in time for four—three—two—one—Boom. Peter's gay strain came through clearly for a minute and then Jannie finished changing records and our house rocked to its foundations with “Heartbreak Hotel.”

“Mommy,” Sally called down, “I can't even hear the hunters coming.”

“Blast off!”

Laurie's door slammed and he came pounding down the back stairs and into the living room. He was carrying his record player and his trumpet. “Dad,” he said pathetically.

His father nodded. “Play the loudest,” he said.

“Got you, man.” They finally decided on Duke Ellington, and I went to sit in the kitchen with all the doors shut so that all I could hear was a kind of steady combined beat which shivered the window frames and got the pots and pans crashing together softly where they hung on the wall. When it got close to nine-thirty I came out to check on Sally and Barry, and found that Sally, fading but grim, had taken off “Peter and the Wolf” and put on another record which featured a kind of laughing woodpecker, but she was getting sleepy. I told her good night, and went on to Barry's room, where Barry had fallen asleep in his space suit somewhere on the dim craters of the moon, fragments of leather all over his bed. I closed his phonograph, covered him, and by the time I came back to Sally she was asleep, with her fairy-tale book open on her stomach and her kitten next to her cheek on the pillow. I put away her book, and moved the kitten to the foot of the bed, where he waited until I was convincingly on the stairs going down again and then moved softly, tiptoeing, back onto Sally's pillow. Sally wiggled comfortably, the kitten purred, and I went on downstairs to find Laurie and my husband relaxing over “Take the A Train.”

Laurie was about to change the record when he hesitated, lifted his head, listened, and looked at his father. His father was listening too. The phonograph upstairs had stopped, and Laurie shook his head gloomily. “Now it comes,” he said.

He was right.

After about half an hour I went to the foot of the back stairs and tried to call up to the girls to be quiet, but they could not hear me. They were apparently using the fortunetelling cards, because I could hear someone calling on a tall dark man and someone else remarking bitterly upon jealousy from a friend. I went halfway up the stairs and shouted, but they still could not hear me. I went to the top and pounded on the door and I could have been banging my head against a stone wall. I could hear the name of a young gentleman of Laurie's acquaintance being bandied about lightly by the ladies inside, coupled—I think—with Laura's name and references to a certain cake-sharing incident at recess, and insane shrieks, presumably from the maligned Laura. Then Kate brought up another name, joining it with Linda's, and the voices rose, Linda disclaiming. I banged both fists on the door, and there was silence for a second until someone said, “Maybe it's your brother,” and there was a great screaming of “Go away! Stay out! Don't come in!”

“Joanne,” I said, and there was absolute silence.

“Yes, mother?” said Jannie at last.

“May I come in?” I asked gently.

“Oh, yes,” said all the little girls.

I opened the door and went in. They were all sitting on the two beds in Jannie's room. The needle arm had been taken off the record, but I could see Elvis Presley going around and around. All the cupcakes were gone, and so was the candy. The fortunetelling cards were scattered over the two beds. Jannie was wearing her pink shortie pajamas, which were certainly too light for that cold night. Linda was wearing blue shortie pajamas. Kate was wearing college-girl-type ski pajamas. Laura was wearing a lace-trimmed nightgown, white, with pink roses. Carole was wearing yellow shortie pajamas. Their hair was mussed, their cheeks were pink, they were crammed uncomfortably together onto the two beds, and they were clearly awake long after their several bedtimes.

“Don't you think,” I said, “that you had better get some sleep?”

“Oh, nooooo,” they all said, and Jannie added, “The party's just beginning.” They were like a pretty bouquet of femininity, and I said—with what I knew Laurie would find a deplorable lack of firmness—that they could stay up for just a few minutes more.

“Dickie,” Kate whispered, clearly referring to some private joke, and all the little girls dissolved into helpless giggles, all except Carole, who cried out indignantly, “I did not, I never did, I don't.”

Downstairs I said nostalgically to my husband and Laurie, “I can remember, when I was about Jannie's age—”

“I just hope the neighbors are all asleep,” my husband said. “Or maybe they just won't know it's coming from here.”

“Probably everyone in the neighborhood saw those characters coming in,” Laurie said.

“Mommy,” Jannie said urgently from the darkness of the dining room. Startled, I hurried in.

“Listen,” she said, “something's gone terribly wrong.”

“What's the matter?”

“Shh,” Jannie said. “It's Kate and Linda. I thought they would both sleep in my library but now Kate isn't talking to Linda because Linda took her lunch box today in school and said she didn't and wouldn't give it back so now Kate won't sleep with Linda.”

“Well, then, why not put Linda—”

“Well, you see, I was going to have Carole in with me because really only don't tell the others, but really she's my best friend of all of them only now I can't put Kate and Linda together and—”

“Why not put one of them in with you?”

“Well, I can't put Carole in with Laura.”

“Why not?” I was getting tired of whispering.

“Well, because they both like Jimmy Watson.”

“Oh,” I said.

“And anyway Carole's wearing a shortie and Kate and Laura aren't.”

“Look,” I said, “how about I sneak up right now through the front hall and make up the guest-room bed? Then you can put someone in there. Jimmy Watson, maybe.”

“Mother,” Jannie turned bright red.

“Sorry,” I said. “Take a pillow from one of the beds in your library. Put someone in the guest room. Keep them busy for a few minutes and I'll have it ready. I just hope I have two more sheets.”

“Oh, thank you.” Jannie turned, and then stopped. “Mother?” she said. “Don't think from what I said that I like Jimmy Watson.”

“The thought never crossed my mind,” I said.

I raced upstairs and found two sheets; they were smallish, and not colored, which meant that they were the very bottom of the pile, but as I closed the guest-room door behind me I thought optimistically that at least Jannie's problems were solved if I excepted Jimmy Watson and the dangerous rivalry of Carole, who is a natural platinum blonde.

Laurie played “Muskrat Ramble.” Jannie came down to the dining room again in about fifteen minutes. “Shh,” she said, when I came in to talk to her. “Kate and Linda want to sleep together in the guest room.”

“But I thought you just said that Kate and Linda—”

“But they made up and Kate apologized for taking Linda's lunch box and Linda apologized for thinking she did, and they're all friends now except Laura is kind of mad because now Kate says she likes Harry Benson better.”

“Better than Laura?” I asked stupidly.

“Oh, Mother. Better than Jimmy Watson, of course. Except I think Harry Benson is goony.”

“If he was the one on patrol who let your brother Barry go across the street by himself he certainly is goony. As a matter of fact if there is one word I would automatically and instinctively apply to young Harry Benson it would surely be—”

“Oh, Mother. He is not.”

I had been kept up slightly past my own bedtime. “All right,” I said. “Harry Benson is not goony and it is fine with me if Kate and Carole sleep in the guest room if they don't—”

“Kate and Linda.”

“Kate and Linda. If they don't, if they only don't giggle any more.”

“Thank you. And may I sleep in the guest room too?”

“What?”

“It's a big bed. And we wanted to talk very quietly about—”

“Never mind,” I said. “Sleep anywhere, but sleep.”

She was downstairs again about ten minutes later. Laurie and his father were eating crackers and cheese and discussing the probable derivation of “cool,” as in “cool jazz.”

“Listen,” Jannie said in the dining room, “can Kate sleep in the guest room too?”

“But I thought Kate was already—”

“Well, she was, but they couldn't sleep, because Kate did take Linda's lunch box and she broke the Thermos and Carole saw her so Carole told Linda and then Kate wouldn't let Carole in the guest room but I can't leave Carole with Laura because Laura said Carole's shortie pajamas were goony and Linda went and told her.”

“That was unkind of Linda,” I said, floundering.

“So then Carole said Linda—”

“Never mind,” I said. “Just tell me who is sleeping where.”

“Well, Kate and I are sleeping in the guest room, because now everyone else is mad at Kate. And Carole is mad at Linda so Carole is sleeping in my room and Linda and Laura are sleeping in my library, except I just really don't know what will happen,” she sighed, “if anyone tells Laura what Linda said about Jerry. Jerry Harper.”

“But can't Carole change with Linda and sleep with Laura?”

“Oh, Mother. You know about Carole and Laura and Jimmy Watson.”

“I guess I just forgot for a minute,” I said.

“Well,” Jannie said, “I just thought I'd let you know where everyone was.”

About half-past one Laurie held up his hand and said, “Listen.” I had been trying to identify the sensation, and thought it was like the sudden lull in a heavy wind which has been beating against the trees and the windows for hours, and then stops. “Can it be possible?” my husband said.

Laurie began to put his records away, moving very softly. I went up the back stairs in my stocking feet, not making a sound, and opened the door to Jannie's room, easing it to avoid the slightest squeak.

Jannie was peacefully asleep in her own bed. The other bed in her room and the three beds in her library were empty. Reflecting upon the cataclysmic powers of Jimmy Watson's name, I found the four other girls all asleep on the guest-room bed. None of them was covered, but there was no way of putting a blanket over them without smothering somebody. I closed the window, and tiptoed away, and came downstairs to tell Laurie it was safe, he could go to bed now.

Then I got myself upstairs and fell into bed, and slept soundly until seventeen minutes past three by the bedroom clock, when I was awakened by Jannie.

“Kate feels sick,” she said. “You've got to get up right away and take her home.”





The Possibility of Evil


Miss Adela Strangeworth came daintily along Main Street on her way to the grocery. The sun was shining, the air was fresh and clear after the night's heavy rain, and everything in Miss Strangeworth's little town looked washed and bright. Miss Strangeworth took deep breaths, and thought that there was nothing in the world like a fragrant summer day.

She knew everyone in town, of course; she was fond of telling strangers—tourists who sometimes passed through the town and stopped to admire Miss Strangeworth's roses—that she had never spent more than a day outside this town in all her long life. She was seventy-one, Miss Strangeworth told the tourists, with a pretty little dimple showing by her lip, and she sometimes found herself thinking that the town belonged to her. “My grandfather built the first house on Pleasant Street,” she would say, opening her blue eyes wide with the wonder of it. “This house, right here. My family has lived here for better than a hundred years. My grandmother planted these roses, and my mother tended them, just as I do. I've watched my town grow; I can remember when Mr. Lewis, Senior, opened the grocery store, and the year the river flooded out the shanties on the low road, and the excitement when some young folks wanted to move the park over to the space in front of where the new post office is today. They wanted to put up a statue of Ethan Allen”—Miss Strangeworth would frown a little and sound stern—“but it should have been a statue of my grandfather. There wouldn't have been a town here at all if it hadn't been for my grandfather and the lumber mill.”

Miss Strangeworth never gave away any of her roses, although the tourists often asked her. The roses belonged on Pleasant Street, and it bothered Miss Strangeworth to think of people wanting to carry them away, to take them into strange towns and down strange streets. When the new minister came, and the ladies were gathering flowers to decorate the church, Miss Strangeworth sent over a great basket of gladioli; when she picked the roses at all, she set them in bowls and vases around the inside of the house her grandfather had built.

Walking down Main Street on a summer morning, Miss Strangeworth had to stop every minute or so to say good morning to someone or to ask after someone's health. When she came into the grocery, half a dozen people turned away from the shelves and the counters to wave at her or call out good morning.

“And good morning to you, too, Mr. Lewis,” Miss Strangeworth said at last. The Lewis family had been in the town almost as long as the Strangeworths; but the day young Lewis left high school and went to work in the grocery,Miss Strangeworth had stopped calling him Tommy and started calling him Mr. Lewis, and he had stopped calling her Addie and started calling her Miss Strangeworth. They had been in high school together, and had gone to picnics together, and to high-school dances and basketball games; but now Mr. Lewis was behind the counter in the grocery, and Miss Strangeworth was living alone in the Strangeworth house on Pleasant Street.

“Good morning,” Mr. Lewis said, and added politely, “lovely day.”

“It is a very nice day,” Miss Strangeworth said as though she had only just decided that it would do after all. “I would like a chop, please, Mr. Lewis,a small, lean veal chop. Are those strawberries from Arthur Parker's garden?They're early this year.”

“He brought them in this morning,” Mr. Lewis said.

“I shall have a box,” Miss Strangeworth said. Mr. Lewis looked worried, she thought, and for a minute she hesitated, but then she decided that he surely could not be worried over the strawberries. He looked very tired indeed. He was usually so chipper, Miss Strangeworth thought, and almost commented,but it was far too personal a subject to be introduced to Mr. Lewis, the grocer,so she only said, “And a can of cat food and, I think, a tomato.”

Silently, Mr. Lewis assembled her order on the counter and waited. Miss Strangeworth looked at him curiously and then said, “It's Tuesday, Mr. Lewis. You forgot to remind me.”

“Did I? Sorry.”

“Imagine your forgetting that I always buy my tea on Tuesday,” Miss Strangeworth said gently. “A quarter pound of tea, please, Mr. Lewis.”

“Is that all, Miss Strangeworth?”

“Yes thank you, Mr. Lewis. Such a lovely day, isn't it?”

“Lovely,” Mr. Lewis said.

Miss Strangeworth moved slightly to make room for Mrs. Harper at the counter, “Morning, Adela,” Mrs. Harper said, and Miss Strangeworth said,“Good morning, Martha.”

“Lovely day,” Mrs. Harper said, and Miss Strangeworth said, “Yes, lovely,”and Mr. Lewis, under Mrs. Harper's glance, nodded.

“Ran out of sugar for my cake frosting,” Mrs. Harper explained. Her hand shook slightly as she opened her pocketbook. Miss Strangeworth wondered,glancing at her quickly, if she had been taking proper care of herself. Martha Harper was not as young as she used to be, Miss Strangeworth thought. She probably could use a good, strong tonic.

“Martha,” she said, “you don't look well.”

“I'm perfectly all right,” Mrs. Harper said shortly. She handed her money to Mr. Lewis, took her change and her sugar, and went out without speaking again. Looking after her, Miss Strangeworth shook her head slightly. Martha definitely did not look well.

Carrying her little bag of groceries, Miss Strangeworth came out of the store into the bright sunlight and stopped to smile down on the Crane baby. Don and Helen Crane were really the two most infatuated young parents she had ever known, she thought indulgently, looking at the delicately embroidered baby cap and the lace-edged carriage cover.

“That little girl is going to grow up expecting luxury all her life,” she said to Helen Crane.

Helen laughed. “That's the way we want her to feel,” she said. “Like a princess.”

“A princess can be a lot of trouble sometimes,” Miss Strangeworth said dryly. “How old is her Highness now?”

“Six months next Tuesday,” Helen Crane said, looking down with rapt wonder at her child. “I've been worrying, though, about her. Don't you think she ought to move around more? Try to sit up, for instance?”

“For plain and fancy worrying,” Miss Strangeworth said, amused, “give me a new mother every time.”

“She just seems—slow,” Helen Crane said.

“Nonsense. All babies are different. Some of them develop much more quickly than others.”

“That's what my mother says.” Helen Crane laughed, looking a little bit ashamed.

“I suppose you've got young Don all upset about the fact that his daughter is already six months old and hasn't yet begun to learn to dance?”

“I haven't mentioned it to him. I suppose she's just so precious that I worry about her all the time.”

“Well, apologize to her right now,” Miss Strangeworth said. “She is probably worrying about why you keep jumping around all the time.” Smiling to herself and shaking her old head, she went on down the sunny street, stopping once to ask little Billy Moore why he wasn't out riding in his daddy's shiny new car, and talking for a few minutes outside the library with Miss Chandler,the librarian, about the new novels to be ordered and paid for by the annual library appropriation. Miss Chandler seemed absentminded and very much as though she was thinking about something else. Miss Strangeworth noticed that Miss Chandler had not taken much trouble with her hair that morning,and sighed. Miss Strangeworth hated sloppiness.

Many people seemed disturbed recently, Miss Strangeworth thought. Only yesterday the Stewarts' fifteen-year-old Linda had run crying down her own front walk and all the way to school, not caring who saw her. People around town thought she might have had a fight with the Harris boy, but they showed up together at the soda shop after school as usual, both of them looking grim and bleak. Trouble at home, people concluded, and sighed over the problems of trying to raise kids right these days.

From halfway down the block Miss Strangeworth could catch the heavy scent of her roses, and she moved a little more quickly. The perfume of roses meant home, and home meant the Strangeworth House on Pleasant Street. Miss Strangeworth stopped at her own front gate, as she always did, and looked with deep pleasure at her house, with the red and pink and white roses massed along the narrow lawn, and the rambler going up along the porch; and the neat, the unbelievably trim lines of the house itself, with its slimness and its washed white look. Every window sparkled, every curtain hung stiff and straight, and even the stones of the front walk were swept and clear. People around town wondered how old Miss Strangeworth managed to keep the house looking the way it did, and there was a legend about a tourist once mistaking it for the local museum and going all through the place without finding out about his mistake. But the town was proud of Miss Strangeworth and her roses and her house. They had all grown together.

Miss Strangeworth went up her front steps, unlocked her front door with her key, and went into the kitchen to put away her groceries. She debated having a cup of tea and then decided that it was too close to midday dinnertime; she would not have the appetite for her little chop if she had tea now. Instead she went into the light, lovely sitting room, which still glowed from the hands of her mother and her grandmother, who had covered the chairs with bright chintz and hung the curtains. All the furniture was spare and shining, and the round hooked rugs on the floor had been the work of Miss Strangeworth's grandmother and her mother. Miss Strangeworth had put a bowl of her red roses on the low table before the window, and the room was full of their scent.

Miss Strangeworth went to the narrow desk in the corner, and unlocked it with her key. She never knew when she might feel like writing letters, so she kept her notepaper inside, and the desk locked. Miss Strangeworth's usual stationery was heavy and cream-colored, with “Strangeworth House”engraved across the top, but, when she felt like writing her other letters, Miss Strangeworth used a pad of various-colored paper, bought from the local newspaper shop. It was almost a town joke, that colored paper, layered in pink and green and blue and yellow; everyone in town bought it and used it for odd, informal notes and shopping lists. It was usual to remark, upon receiving a note written on a blue page, that so-and-so would be needing a new pad soon—here she was, down to the blue already. Everyone used the matching envelopes for tucking away recipes, or keeping odd little things in, or even to hold cookies in the school lunch boxes. Mr. Lewis sometimes gave them to the children for carrying home penny candy.

Although Miss Strangeworth's desk held a trimmed quill pen, which had belonged to her grandfather, and a gold-frost fountain pen, which had belonged to her father, Miss Strangeworth always used a dull stub of pencil when she wrote her letters, and she printed them in a childish block print. After thinking for a minute, although she had been phrasing the letter in the back of her mind all the way home, she wrote on a pink sheet: DIDN'T YOU EVER SEE AN IDIOT CHILD BEFORE? SOME PEOPLE JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN, SHOULD THEY?

She was pleased with the letter. She was fond of doing things exactly right. When she made a mistake, as she sometimes did, or when the letters were not spaced nicely on the page, she had to take the discarded page to the kitchen stove and burn it at once. Miss Strangeworth never delayed when things had to be done.

After thinking for a minute, she decided that she would like to write another letter, perhaps to go to Mrs. Harper, to follow up the ones she had already mailed. She selected a green sheet this time and wrote quickly: HAVE YOU FOUND OUT YET WHAT THEY WERE ALL LAUGHING ABOUT AFTER YOU LEFT THE BRIDGE CLUB ON THURSDAY?OR IS THE WIFE REALLY ALWAYS THE LAST ONE TO KNOW?

Miss Strangeworth never concerned herself with facts; her letters all dealt with the more negotiable stuff of suspicion. Mr. Lewis would never have imagined for a minute that his grandson might be lifting petty cash from the store register if he had not had one of Miss Strangeworth's letters. Miss Chandler, the librarian, and Linda Stewart's parents would have gone unsuspectingly ahead with their lives, never aware of possible evil lurking nearby, if Miss Strangeworth had not sent letters opening their eyes. Miss Strangeworth would have been genuinely shocked if there had been anything between Linda Stewart and the Harris boy, but, as long as evil existed unchecked in the world, it was Miss Strangeworth's duty to keep her town alert to it. It was far more sensible for Miss Chandler to wonder what Mr. Shelley's first wife had really died of than to take a chance on not knowing. There were so many wicked people in the world and only one Strangeworth left in town. Besides, Miss Strangeworth liked writing her letters.

She addressed an envelope to Don Crane after a moment's thought, wondering curiously if he would show the letter to his wife, and using a pink envelope to match the pink paper. Then she addressed a second envelope,green, to Mrs. Harper. Then an idea came to her and she selected a blue sheet and wrote: YOU NEVER KNOW ABOUT DOCTORS. REMEMBER THEY'RE ONLY HUMAN AND NEED MONEY LIKE THE REST OF US. SUPPOSE THE KNIFE SLIPPED ACCIDENTALLY. WOULD DOCTOR BURNS GET HIS FEE AND A LITTLE EXTRA FROM THAT NEPHEW OF YOURS?

She addressed the blue envelope to old Mrs. Foster, who was having an operation next month. She had thought of writing one more letter, to the head of the school board, asking how a chemistry teacher like Billy Moore's father could afford a new convertible, but all at once she was tired of writing letters. The three she had done would do for one day. She could write more tomorrow; it was not as though they all had to be done at once.

She had been writing her letters—sometimes two or three every day for a week, sometimes no more than one in a month—for the past year. She never got any answers, of course, because she never signed her name. If she had been asked, she would have said that her name, Adela Strangeworth, a name honored in the town for so many years, did not belong on such trash. The town where she lived had to be kept clean and sweet, but people everywhere were lustful and evil and degraded, and needed to be watched; the world was so large, and there was only one Strangeworth left in it. Miss Strangeworth sighed, locked her desk, and put the letters into her big, black leather pocketbook, to be mailed when she took her evening walk.

She broiled her little chop nicely, and had a sliced tomato and good cup of tea ready when she sat down to her midday dinner at the table in her dining room, which could be opened to seat twenty-two, with a second table, if necessary, in the hall. Sitting in the warm sunlight that came through the tall windows of the dining room, seeing her roses massed outside, handling the heavy, old silverware and the fine, translucent china, Miss Strangeworth was pleased; she would not have cared to be doing anything else. People must live graciously, after all, she thought, and sipped her tea. Afterward, when her plate and cup and saucer were washed and dried and put back onto the shelves where they belonged, and her silverware was back in the mahogany silver chest,Miss Strangeworth went up the graceful staircase and into her bedroom, which was the front room overlooking the roses, and had been her mother'sand her grandmother's. Their Crown Derby dresser set and furs had been kept here, their fans and silver-backed brushes and their own bowls of roses; Miss Strangeworth kept a bowl of white roses on the bed table.

She drew the shades, took the rose-satin spread from the bed,slipped out of her dress and her shoes, and lay down tiredly. She knew that no doorbell or phone would ring; no one in town would dare to disturb Miss Strangeworth during her afternoon nap. She slept,deep in the rich smell of roses.

After her nap she worked in her garden for a little while, sparing herself because of the heat; then she went in to her supper. She ate asparagus from her own garden, with sweet-butter sauce, and a soft-boiled egg, and, while she had her supper, she listened to a late-evening news broadcast and then to a program of classical music on her small radio. After her dishes were done and her kitchen set in order, she took up her hat—Miss Strangeworth's hats were proverbial in the town; people believed that she had inherited them from her mother and her grandmother—and, locking the front door of her house behind her, set off on her evening walk, pocketbook under her arm. She nodded to Linda Stewart's father, who was washing his car in the pleasantly cool evening. She thought that he looked troubled.

There was only one place in town where she could mail her letters, and that was the new post office, shiny with red brick and silver letters. Although Miss Strangeworth had never given the matter any particular thought, she had always made a point of mailing her letters very secretly; it would, of course, not have been wise to let anyone see her mail them. Consequently, she timed her walk so she could reach the post office just as darkness was starting to dim the outlines of the trees and the shapes of people's faces, although no one could ever mistake Miss Strangeworth, with her dainty walk and her rustling skirts.

There was always a group of young people around the post office, the very youngest roller-skating upon its driveway, which went all the way around the building and was the only smooth road in town; and the slightly older ones already knowing how to gather in small groups and chatter and laugh and make great, excited plans for going across the street to the soda shop in a minute or two. Miss Strangeworth had never had any self-consciousness before the children. She did not feel that any of them were staring at her unduly or longing to laugh at her; it would have been most reprehensible for their parents to permit their children to mock Miss Strangeworth of Pleasant Street. Most of the children stood back respectfully as Miss Strangeworth passed, silenced briefly in her presence, and some of the older children greeted her,saying soberly, “Hello, Miss Strangeworth.”

Miss Strangeworth smiled at them and quickly went on. It had been a long time since she had known the name of every child in town. The mail slot was in the door of the post office. The children stood away as Miss Strangeworth approached it, seemingly surprised that anyone should want to use the post office after it had been officially closed up for the night and turned over to the children. Miss Strangeworth stood by the door, opening her black pocketbook to take out the letters, and heard a voice which she knew at once to be Linda Stewart's. Poor little Linda was crying again, and Miss Strangeworth listened carefully. This was, after all, her town, and these were her people; if one of them was in trouble, she ought to know about it.

“I can't tell you, Dave,” Linda was saying—so she was talking to the Harris boy, as Miss Strangeworth had supposed—“I just can't. It's just nasty.”

“But why won't your father let me come around anymore? What on earth did I do?”

“I can't tell you. I just wouldn't tell you for anything. You've got to have a dirty, dirty mind for things like that.”

“But something's happened. You've been crying and crying, and your father is all upset. Why can't I know about it, too? Aren't I like one of the family?”

“Not anymore, Dave, not anymore. You're not to come near our house again; my father said so. He said he'd horsewhip you. That's all I can tell you: You're not to come near our house anymore.”

“But I didn't do anything.”

“Just the same, my father said...”

Miss Strangeworth sighed and turned away. There was so much evil in people. Even in a charming little town like this one, there was still so much evil in people.

She slipped her letters into the slot, and two of them fell inside. The third caught on the edge and fell outside, onto the ground at Miss Strangeworth's feet. She did not notice it because she was wondering whether a letter to the Harris boy's father might not be of some service in wiping out this potential badness. Wearily Miss Strangeworth turned to go home to her quiet bed in her lovely house, and never heard the Harris boy calling to her to say that she had dropped something.

“Old lady Strangeworth's getting deaf,” he said, looking after her and holding in his hand the letter he had picked up.

“Well, who cares?” Linda said. “Who cares anymore, anyway?”

“It's for Don Crane,” the Harris boy said, “this letter. She dropped a letter addressed to Don Crane. Might as well take it on over. We pass his house anyway.” He laughed. “Maybe it's got a check or something in it and he'd be just as glad to get it tonight instead of tomorrow.”

“Catch old lady Strangeworth sending anybody a check,” Linda said. “Throw it in the post office. Why do anyone a favor?” She sniffed. “Doesn't seem to me anybody around here cares about us,” she said. “Why should we care about them?”

“I'll take it over, anyway,” the Harris boy said. “Maybe it's good news for them. Maybe they need something happy tonight, too. Like us.”

Sadly, holding hands, they wandered off down the dark street, the Harris boy carrying Miss Strangeworth's pink envelope in his hand.

Miss Strangeworth awakened the next morning with a feeling of intense happiness and, for a minute, wondered why, and then remembered that this morning three people would open her letters. Harsh, perhaps, at first, but wickedness was never easily banished, and a clean heart was a scoured heart. She washed her soft, old face and brushed her teeth, still sound in spite of her seventy-one years, and dressed herself carefully in her sweet, soft clothes and buttoned shoes. Then, going downstairs, reflecting that perhaps a little waffle would be agreeable for breakfast in the sunny dining room, she found the mail on the hall floor, and bent to pick it up. A bill, the morning paper, a letter in a green envelope that looked oddly familiar. Miss Strangeworth stood perfectly still for a minute, looking down at the green envelope with the penciled printing, and thought: It looks like one of my letters. Was one of my letters sent back? No, because no one would know where to send it. How did this get here?

Miss Strangeworth was a Strangeworth of Pleasant Street. Her hand did not shake as she opened the envelope and unfolded the sheet of green paper inside. She began to cry silently for the wickedness of the world when she read the words: LOOK OUT AT WHAT USED TO BE YOUR ROSES.





The Bus


Old Miss Harper was going home, although the night was wet and nasty. Miss Harper disliked traveling at any time, and she particularly disliked traveling on this dirty small bus which was her only way of getting home; she had frequently complained to the bus company about their service because it seemed that no matter where she wanted to go, they had no respectable bus to carry her. Getting away from home was bad enough—Miss Harper was fond of pointing out to the bus company—but getting home always seemed very close to impossible. Tonight Miss Harper had no choice: if she did not go home by this particular bus she could not go for another day. Annoyed, tired, depressed, she tapped irritably on the counter of the little tobacco store which served also as the bus station. Sir, she was thinking, beginning her letter of complaint, although I am an elderly lady of modest circumstances and must curtail my fondness for travel, let me point out that your bus service falls far below…

Outside, the bus stirred noisily, clearly not anxious to be moving; Miss Harper thought she could already hear the weary sound of its springs sinking out of shape. I just can't make this trip again, Miss Harper thought, even seeing Stephanie isn't worth it, they really go out of their way to make you uncomfortable. “Can I get my ticket, please?” she said sharply, and the old man at the other end of the counter put down his paper and gave her a look of hatred.

Miss Harper ordered her ticket, deploring her own cross voice, and the old man slapped it down on the counter in front of her and said, “You got three minutes before the bus leaves.”

He'd love to tell me I missed it, Miss Harper thought, and made a point of counting her change.

The rain was beating down, and Miss Harper hurried the few exposed steps to the door of the bus. The driver was slow in opening the door, and as Miss Harper climbed in she was thinking, Sir, I shall never travel with your company again. Your ticket salesmen are ugly, your drivers are surly, your vehicles indescribably filthy…

There were already several people sitting in the bus, and Miss Harper wondered where they could possibly be going; were there really this many small towns served only by this bus? Were there really other people who would endure this kind of trip to get somewhere, even home? I'm very out of sorts, Miss Harper thought, very out of sorts; it's too strenuous a visit for a woman of my age; I need to get home. She thought of a hot bath and a cup of tea and her own bed, and sighed. No one offered to help her put her suitcase on the rack, and she glanced over her shoulder at the driver sitting with his back turned and thought, he'd probably rather put me off the bus than help me, and then, perceiving her own ill nature, smiled. The bus company might write a letter of complaint about me, she told herself and felt better. She had providentially taken a sleeping pill before leaving for the bus station, hoping to sleep through as much of the trip as possible, and at last, sitting near the back, she promised herself that it would not be unbearably long before she had a bath and a cup of tea, and tried to compose the bus company's letter of complaint. Madam, a lady of your experience and advanced age ought surely to be aware of the problems confronting a poor but honest little company which wants only…

She was aware that the bus had started, because she was rocked and bounced in her seat, and the feeling of rattling and throbbing beneath the soles of her shoes stayed with her even when she slept at last. She lay back uneasily, her head resting on the seat back, moving back and forth with the motion of the bus, and around her other people slept, or spoke softly, or stared blankly out the windows at the passing lights and the rain.

Sometime during her sleep Miss Harper was jostled by someone moving into the seat behind her, her head was pushed and her hat disarranged; for a minute, bewildered by sleep, Miss Harper clutched at her hat, and said vaguely, “Who?”

“Go back to sleep,” a young voice said, and giggled. “I'm just running away from home, that's all.”

Miss Harper was not awake, but she opened her eyes a little and looked up to the ceiling of the bus. “That's wrong,” Miss Harper said as clearly as she could. “That's wrong. Go back.”

There was another giggle. “Too late,” the voice said. “Go back to sleep.”

Miss Harper did. She slept uncomfortably and awkwardly, her mouth a little open. Sometime, perhaps an hour later, her head was jostled again and the voice said, “I think I'm going to get off here. 'Bye, now.”

“You'll be sorry,” Miss Harper said, asleep. “Go back.”

Then, still later, the bus driver was shaking her. “Look, lady,” he was saying, “I'm not an alarm clock. Wake up and get off the bus.”

“What?” Miss Harper stirred, opened her eyes, felt for her pocketbook.

“I'm not an alarm clock,” the driver said. His voice was harsh and tired. “I'm not an alarm clock. Get off the bus.”

“What?” said Miss Harper again.

“This is as far as you go. You got a ticket to here. You've arrived. And I am not an alarm clock waking up people to tell them when it's time to get off; you got here, lady, and it's not part of my job to carry you off the bus. I'm not—”

“I intend to report you,” Miss Harper said, awake. She felt for her pocketbook and found it in her lap, moved her feet, straightened her hat. She was stiff and moving was difficult.

“Report me. But from somewhere else. I got a bus to run. Now will you please get off so I can go on my way?”

His voice was loud, and Miss Harper was sickeningly aware of faces turned toward her from along the bus, grins, amused comments. The driver turned and stamped off down the bus to his seat, saying, “She thinks I'm an alarm clock,” and Miss Harper, without assistance and moving clumsily, took down her suitcase and struggled with it down the aisle. Her suitcase banged against seats, and she knew that people were staring at her; she was terribly afraid that she might stumble and fall.

“I'll certainly report you,” she said to the driver, who shrugged.

“Come on, lady,” he said. “It's the middle of the night and I got a bus to run.”

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” Miss Harper said wildly, wanting to cry.

“Lady,” the driver said with elaborate patience, “please get off my bus.”

The door was open, and Miss Harper eased herself and her suitcase onto the steep step. “She thinks everyone's an alarm clock, got to see she gets off the bus,” the driver said behind her, and Miss Harper stepped onto the ground. Suitcase, pocketbook, gloves, hat; she had them all. She had barely taken stock when the bus started with a jerk, almost throwing her backward, and Miss Harper, for the first time in her life, wanted to run and shake her fist at someone. I'll report him, she thought, I'll see that he loses his job, and then she realized that she was in the wrong place.

Standing quite still in the rain and the darkness Miss Harper became aware that she was not at the bus corner of her town where the bus should have left her. She was on an empty crossroads in the rain. There were no stores, no lights, no taxis, no people. There was nothing, in fact, but a wet dirt road under her feet and a signpost where two roads came together. Don't panic, Miss Harper told herself, almost whispering, don't panic; it's all right, it's all right, you'll see that it's all right, don't be frightened.

She took a few steps in the direction the bus had gone, but it was out of sight and when Miss Harper called falteringly, “Come back” and, “Help,” there was no answer to the shocking sound of her own voice out loud except the steady drive of the rain. I sound old, she thought, but I will not panic. She turned in a circle, her suitcase in her hand, and told herself, don't panic, it's all right.

There was no shelter in sight, but the signpost said RICKET'S LANDING; so that's where I am, Miss Harper thought, I've come to Ricket's Landing and I don't like it here. She set her suitcase down next to the signpost and tried to see down the road; perhaps there might be a house, or even some kind of a barn or shed where she could get out of the rain. She was crying a little, and lost and hopeless, saying Please, won't someone come? when she saw headlights far off down the road and realized that someone was really coming to help her. She ran to the middle of the road and stood waving, her gloves wet and her pocketbook draggled. “Here,” she called, “here I am, Please come and help me.”

Through the sound of the rain she could hear the motor, and then the headlights caught her and, suddenly embarrassed, she put her pocketbook in front of her face while the lights were on her. The lights belonged to a small truck, and it came to an abrupt stop beside her and the window near her was rolled down and a man's voice said furiously, “You want to get killed? You trying to get killed or something? What you doing in the middle of the road, trying to get killed?” The young man turned and spoke to the driver. “It's some dame. Running out in the road like that.”

“Please,” Miss Harper said, as he seemed almost about to close the window again, “please help me. The bus put me off here when it wasn't my stop and I'm lost.”

“Lost?” The young man laughed richly. “First I ever heard anyone getting lost in Ricket's Landing. Mostly they have trouble finding it.” He laughed again, and the driver, leaning forward over the steering wheel to look curiously at Miss Harper, laughed too. Miss Harper put on a willing smile, and said, “Can you take me somewhere? Perhaps a bus station?”

“No bus station.” The young man shook his head profoundly. “Bus comes through here every night, stops if he's got any passengers.”

“Well,” Miss Harper's voice rose in spite of herself; she was suddenly afraid of antagonizing these young men; perhaps they might even leave her here where they found her, in the wet and dark. “Please,” she said, “can I get in with you, out of the rain?”

The two young men looked at each other. “Take her down to the old lady's,” one of them said.

“She's pretty wet to get in the truck,” the other one said.

“Please,” Miss Harper said, “I'll be glad to pay you what I can.”

“We'll take you to the old lady,” the driver said. “Come on, move over,” he said to the other young man.

“Wait, my suitcase.” Miss Harper ran back to the signpost, no longer caring how she must look, stumbling about in the rain, and brought her suitcase over to the truck.

“That's awful wet,” the young man said. He opened the door and took the suitcase from Miss Harper. “I'll just throw it in the back,” he said, and turned and tossed the suitcase into the back of the truck; Miss Harper heard the sodden thud of its landing, and wondered what things would look like when she unpacked; my bottle of cologne, she thought despairingly. “Get in,” the young man said, and, “My God, you're wet.”

Miss Harper had never climbed up into a truck before, and her skirt was tight and her gloves slippery from the rain. Without help from the young man she put one knee on the high step and somehow hoisted herself in; this cannot be happening to me, she thought clearly. The young man pulled away fastidiously as Miss Harper slid onto the seat next to him.

“You are pretty wet,” the driver said, leaning over the wheel to look around at Miss Harper. “Why were you out in the rain like that?”

“The bus driver.” Miss Harper began to peel off her gloves; somehow she had to make an attempt to dry herself. “He told me it was my stop.”

“That would be Johnny Talbot,” the driver said to the other young man. “He drives that bus.”

“Well, I'm going to report him,” Miss Harper said. There was a little silence in the truck, and then the driver said, “Johnny's a good guy. He means all right.”

“He's a bad bus driver,” Miss Harper said sharply.

The truck did not move. “You don't want to report old Johnny,” the driver said.

“I most certainly —” Miss Harper began, and then stopped. Where am I? she thought, what is happening to me? “No,” she said at last, “I won't report old Johnny.”

The driver started the truck, and they moved slowly down the road, through the mud and the rain. The windshield wipers swept back and forth hypnotically, there was a narrow line of light ahead from their headlights, and Miss Harper thought, what is happening to me? She stirred, and the young man next to her caught his breath irritably and drew back. “She's soaking wet,” he said to the driver. “I'm wet already.”

“We're going down to the old lady's,” the driver said. “She'll know what to do.”

“What old lady?” Miss Harper did not dare to move, even turn her head. “Is there any kind of a bus station? Or even a taxi?”

“You could,” the driver said consideringly, “you could wait and catch that same bus tomorrow night when it goes through. Johnny'll be driving her.”

“I just want to get home as soon as possible,” Miss Harper said. The truck seat was dreadfully uncomfortable, she felt steamy and sticky and chilled through, and home seemed so far away that perhaps it did not exist at all.

“Just down the road a mile or so,” the driver said reassuringly.

“I've never heard of Ricket's Landing,” Miss Harper said. “I can't imagine how he came to put me off there.”

“Maybe somebody else was supposed to get off there and he thought it was you by mistake.” This deduction seemed to tax the young man's mind to the utmost, because he said, “See, someone else might of been supposed to get off instead of you.”

“Then he's still on the bus,” said the driver, and they were both silent, appalled.

Ahead of them a light flickered, showing dimly through the rain, and the driver pointed and said, “There, that's where we're going.” As they came closer Miss Harper was aware of a growing dismay. The light belonged to what seemed to be a roadhouse, and Miss Harper had never been inside a roadhouse in her life. The house itself was only a dim shape looming in the darkness, and the light over the side door, illuminated only a sign, hanging crooked, which read BEER Bar & Grill.

“Is there anywhere else I could go?” Miss Harper asked timidly, clutching her pocketbook. “I'm not at all sure, you know, that I ought —”

“Not many people here tonight,” the driver said, turning the truck into the driveway and pulling up in the parking lot which had once, Miss Harper was sad to see, been a garden. “Rain, probably.”

Peering through the window and the rain, Miss Harper felt, suddenly, a warm stir of recognition, of welcome; It's the house, she thought, why, of course, the house is lovely. It had clearly been an old mansion once, solidly and handsomely built, with the balance and style that belonged to a good house of an older time. “Why?” Miss Harper asked, wanting to know why such a good house should have a light tacked on over the side door, and a sign hanging crooked but saying BEER Bar & Grill; “Why?” asked Miss Harper, but the driver said, “This is where you wanted to go. Get her suitcase,” he told the other young man.

“In here?” asked Miss Harper, feeling a kind of indignation on behalf of the fine old house. “into this saloon?” Why, I used to live in a house like this, she thought, what are they doing to our old houses?

The driver laughed. “You'll be safe,” he said.

Carrying her suitcase and her pocketbook Miss Harper followed the two young men to the lighted door and passed under the crooked sign. Shameful, she thought, they haven't even bothered to take care of the place; it needs paint and tightening all around and probably a new roof, and then the driver said, “Come on, come on,” and pushed open the heavy door.

“I used to live in a house like this,” Miss Harper said, and the young men laughed.

“I bet you did,” one of them said, and Miss Harper stopped in the doorway, staring, and realized how strange she must have sounded. Where there had certainly once been comfortable rooms, high-ceilinged and square, with tall doors and polished floors, there was now one large dirty room, with a counter running along one side and half a dozen battered tables; there was a jukebox in a corner and torn linoleum on the floor. “Oh, no,” Miss Harper said. The room smelled unpleasant, and the rain slapped against the bare windows.

Sitting around the tables and standing around the jukebox were perhaps a dozen young people, resembling the two who had brought Miss Harper here, all looking oddly alike, all talking and laughing flatly. Miss Harper leaned back against the door; for a minute she thought they were laughing about her. She was wet and disheartened and these noisy people did not belong at all in the old house. Then the driver turned and gestured to her. “Come and meet the old lady,” he said, and then, to the room at large, “Look, we brought company.”

“Please,” Miss Harper said, but no one had given her more than a glance. With her suitcase and her pocketbook she followed the two young men across to the counter; her suitcase bumped against her legs and she thought, I must not fall down.

“Belle, Belle,” the driver said, “look at the stray cat we found.”

An enormous woman swung around in her seat at the end of the counter, and looked at Miss Harper; looking up and down, looking at the suitcase and Miss Harper's wet hat and wet shoes, looking at Miss Harper's pocketbook and gloves squeezed in her hand, the woman seemed hardly to move her eyes; it was almost as though she absorbed Miss Harper without any particular effort. “Hell you say,” the woman said at last. Her voice was surprisingly soft. “Hell you say.”

“She's wet,” the second young man said; the two young men stood one on either side of Miss Harper, presenting her, and the enormous woman looked her up and down. “Please,” Miss Harper said; here was a woman at least, someone who might understand and sympathize, “please, they put me off my bus at the wrong stop and I can't seem to find my way home. Please.”

“Hell you say,” the woman said, and laughed, a gentle laugh. “She sure is wet,” she said.

“Please,” Miss Harper said.

“You'll take care of her?” the driver asked. He turned and smiled down at Miss Harper, obviously waiting, and, remembering, Miss Harper fumbled in her pocketbook for her wallet. How much, she was wondering, not wanting to ask, it was such a short ride, but if they hadn't come I might have gotten pneumonia, and paid all those doctor's bills; I have caught cold, she thought with great clarity, and choes two five-dollar bills from her wallet. They can't argue over five dollars each, she thought, and sneezed. The two young men and the large woman were watching her with great interest, and all of them saw that after Miss Harper took out the two five-dollar bills there were a single and two tens left in the wallet. The money was not wet. I suppose I should be grateful for that, Miss Harper thought, moving slowly. She handed a five-dollar bill to each young man and felt that they glanced at one another over her head.

“Thanks,” the driver said; I could have gotten away with a dollar each, Miss Harper thought. “Thanks,” the driver said again, and the other young man said, “Say, thanks.”

“Thank you,” Miss Harper said formally.

“I'll put you up for the night,” the woman said. “You can sleep here. Go tomorrow.” She looked Miss Harper up and down again. “Dry off a little,” she said.

“Is there anywhere else?” Then, afraid that this might seem ungracious, Miss Harper said, “I mean, is there any way of going on tonight? I don't want to impose.”

“We got rooms for rent.” The woman half turned back to the counter. “Cost you ten for the night.”

She's leaving me bus fare home, Miss Harper thought; I suppose I should be grateful.“I'd better, I guess,” she said, taking out her wallet again. “I mean, thank you.”

The woman accepted the bill and half turned back to the counter. “Upstairs,” she said. “Take your choice. No one's around.” She glanced sideways at Miss Harper. “I'll see you get a cup of coffee in the morning. I wouldn't turn a dog out without a cup of coffee.”

“Thank you.” Miss Harper knew where the staircase would be, and she turned and, carrying her suitcase and her pocketbook, went to what had once been the front hall, and there was the staircase, so lovely in its proportions that she caught her breath. She turned back and saw the large woman staring at her, and said, “I used to live in a house like this. Built about the same time, I guess. One of those good old houses that were made to stand forever, and where people —”

“Hell you say,” the woman said, and turned back to the counter.

The young people scattered around the big room were talking; in one corner a group surrounded the two who had brought Miss Harper and now and then they laughed. Miss Harper was touched with a little sadness now, looking at them, so at home in the big ugly room which had once been so beautiful. It would be nice, she thought, to speak to these young people, perhaps even become their friend, talk and laugh with them; perhaps they might like to know that this spot where they came together had been a lady's drawing room. Hesitating a little, Miss Harper wondered if she might call “Good night” or “Thank you” again, or even “God bless you all.” Then, since no one looked at her, she started up the stairs. Halfway there was a landing with a stained-glass window, and Miss Harper stopped, holding her breath. When she had been a child the stained-glass window on the stair landing in her house had caught the sunlight, and scattered it on the stairs in a hundred colors. Fairyland colors, Miss Harper thought, remembering; I wonder why we don't live in these houses now. I'm lonely, Miss Harper thought, and then she thought, but I must get out of these wet clothes; I really am catching cold.

Without thinking she turned at the top of the stairs and went to the front room on the left; that had always been her room. The door was open and she glanced in; this was clearly a bedroom for rent, and it was ugly and drab and cheap. The light turned on with a cord hanging beside the door, and Miss Harper stood in the doorway, saddened by the peeling wallpaper and the sagging floor; what have they done to the house, she thought; how can I sleep here tonight?

At last she moved to cross the room and set her suitcase on the bed. I must get dry, she told herself, I must make the best of things. The bed was correctly placed, between the two front windows, but the mattress was stiff and lumpy, and Miss Harper was frightened at the faint smell of dark couplings and a remote echo in the springs; I will not think about such things, Miss Harper thought, I will not let myself dwell on any such thing; this might be the room where I slept as a girl. The windows were almost right—two across the front, two at the side—and the door was placed correctly; how they did build these old places to a square-cut pattern, Miss Harper thought, how they did put them together; there must be a thousand houses all over the country built exactly like this. The closet, however, was on the wrong side. Some oddness of construction had set the closet to Miss Harper's right as she sat on the bed, when it ought really to have been on her left; when she was a girl the big closet had been her playhouse and her hiding place, but it had been on the left.

The bathroom was wrong, too, but that was less important. Miss Harper had thought wistfully of a hot tub before she slept, but a glance at the bathtub discouraged her; she could simply wait until she got home. She washed her face and hands, and the warm water comforted her. She was further comforted to find that her bottle of cologne had not broken in her suitcase and that nothing inside had gotten wet. At least she could sleep in a dry nightgown, although in a cold bed.

She shivered once in the cold sheets, remembering a child's bed. She lay in the darkness with her eyes open, wondering at last where she was and how she had gotten here: first the bus and then the truck, and now she lay in the darkness and no one knew where she was or what was to become of her. She had only her suitcase and a little money in her pocketbook; she did not know where she was. She was very tired and she thought that perhaps the sleeping pill she had taken much earlier had still not quite worn off; perhaps the sleeping pill had been affecting all her actions, since she had been following docilely, bemused, wherever she was taken; in the morning, she told herself sleepily, I'll show them I can make decisions for myself.

The noise downstairs which had been a jukebox and adolescent laughter faded softly into a distant melody; my mother is singing in the drawing room, Miss Harper thought, and the company is sitting on the stiff little chairs listening; my father is playing the piano. She could not quite distinguish the song, but it was one she had heard her mother sing many times; I could creep out to the top of the stairs and listen, she thought, and then became aware that there was a rustling in the closet, but the closet was on the wrong side, on the right instead of the left. It is more a rattling than a rustling, Miss Harper thought, wanting to listen to her mother singing, it is as though something wooden were being shaken around. Shall I get out of bed and quiet it so I can hear the singing? Am I too warm and comfortable, am I too sleepy?

The closet was on the wrong side, but the rattling continued, just loud enough to be irritating, and at last, knowing she would never sleep until it stopped, Miss Harper swung her legs over the side of the bed and, sleepily, padded barefoot over to the closet door, reminding herself to go to the right instead of the left.

“What are you doing in there?” she asked aloud, and opened the door. There was just enough light for her to see that it was a wooden snake, head lifted, stirring and rattling itself against the other toys. Miss Harper laughed. “It's my snake,” she said aloud, “it's my old snake, and it's come alive.” In the back of the closet she could see her old toy clown, bright and cheerful, and as she watched, enchanted, the toy clown flopped languidly forward and back, coming alive. At Miss Harper's feet the snake moved blindly, clattering against a doll house where the tiny people inside stirred, and against a set of blocks, which fell and crashed. Then Miss Harper saw the big beautiful doll sitting on a small chair, the doll with long golden curls and wide-lashed blue eyes and a stiff organdy party dress; as Miss Harper held out her hands in joy the doll opened her eyes and stood up.

“Rosabelle,” Miss Harper cried out, “Rosabelle, it's me.”

The doll turned, looking widely at her, smile painted on. The red lips opened and the doll quacked, outrageously, a flat slapping voice coming out of that fair mouth. “Go away, old lady,” the doll said, “go away, old lady, go away.”

Miss Harper backed away, staring. The clown tumbled and danced, mouthing at Miss Harper, the snake flung its eyeless head viciously at her ankles, and the doll turned, holding her skirts, and her mouth opened and shut. “Go away,” she quacked, “go away, old lady, go away.”

The inside of the closet was all alive; a small doll ran madly from side to side, the animals paraded solemnly down the gangplank of Noah's ark, a stuffed bear wheezed asthmatically. The noise was louder and louder, and then Miss Harper realized that they were all looking at her hatefully and moving toward her. The doll said “Old lady, old lady,” and stepped forward; Miss Harper slammed the closet door and lcaned against it. Behind her the snake crashed against the door and the doll's voice went on and on. Crying out, Miss Harper turned and fled, but the closet was on the wrong side and she turned the wrong way and found herself cowering against the far wall with the door impossibly far away while the closet door slowly opened and the doll's face, smiling, looked for her.

Miss Harper fled. Without stopping to look behind she flung herself across the room and through the door, down the hall and on down the wide lovely stairway. “Mommy,” she screamed, “Mommy, Mommy.”

Screaming, she fled out the door. “Mommy,” she cried, and fell, going down and down into darkness, turning, trying to catch onto something solid and real, crying.

“Look, lady,” the bus driver said. “I'm not an alarm clock. Wake up and get off the bus.”

“You'll be sorry,” Miss Harper said distinctly.

“Wake up,” he said, “wake up and get off the bus.”

“I intend to report you,” Miss Harper said. Pocketbook, gloves, hat, suitcase.

“I'll certainly report you,” she said, almost crying.

“This is as far as you go,” the driver said.

The bus lurched, moved, and Miss Harper almost stumbled in the driving rain, her suitcase at her feet, under the sign reading RICKET'S LANDING.





Come Along with Me


1


I always believe in eating when I can. I had plenty of money and no name when I got off the train and even though I had had lunch in the dining car I liked the idea of stopping off for coffee and a doughnut while I decided exactly which way I intended to go, or which way I was intended to go. I do not believe in turning one way or another without consideration, but then neither do I believe that anything is positively necessary at any given time. I got off the train with plenty of money; I needed a name and a place to go; enjoyment and excitement and a fine high gleefulness I knew I could provide on my own.

A woman said to me in the train station, “My sister might want to rent a room to a nice lady; she's got this little crippled kid.”

I could use a little crippled kid, I thought, and so I said, “Where does your sister live, dear?”

A fine high gleefulness; I think you understand me; I have everything I want.

I sold the house at a profit. Once I got Hughie buried—my God, he was a lousy painter—I only had to make a thousand and three trips back and forth from the barn—which was a studio, which was a mess—to the house. At my age and size—both forty-four, in case it's absolutely vital to know—I was carrying those paintings and half-finished canvasses (“This is the one the artist was working on the morning of the day he died,” and it was just as lousy as all the rest; not even imminent glowing death could help that Hughie) and books and boxes of letters and more than anything else cartons and cartons of things Hughie saved, his old dance programs and marriage licenses and fans and the like. It was none of it anything I ever wanted to see again, I promise you, but I didn't dare throw any of it away for fear Hughie might turn up someday asking, the way they sometimes do, and knowing Hughie it would be the carbon copy of something back in 1946 he wanted. Everything he might ever possibly come around asking for went into the barn; one thousand and three trips back and forth.

I am not a callous person and no one Hughie ever knew could possibly call me practical, but I had waited long enough. I knew I could sell the house. The furniture went to everyone, and I did think that was funny. They came up to me at the auction, people I had known for years, people who had come to the funeral, people who had sat on the chairs and eaten at the dining-room table and sometimes passed out on the beds, if the truth were known, and they said things like “I bought your little maple desk and anytime you want it back it's waiting for you,” and “Listen, we picked up the silver service, but it's nothing personal,” and “You know the piano will find a happy home with us,” and “We are grieving with you today”—no, that one they said at the funeral. In any case, all the people I had known for years came to the auction and the ones who had the nerve came up and spoke to me, sometimes embarrassed because here they were peeking at the undersprings of my sofa, and sometimes just plain brazen because they had gotten something of mine they wanted. I heard one woman—no names, of course; no one has a name yet—saying to another woman that the dining-room breakfront had always been wasted on me, which was true; I only kept it at all because I was afraid my dead grandmother would come around asking. Actually, almost all of it was wasted on me. It was Hughie's idea. “You come of such a nice family,” he used to say to me, “your people were all such cultivated educated people; try to remember.”

So that was how I started out. I'd thought about it for a long time of course—not that I positively expected I was going to have to bury Hughie, but he had a good life—and everything went the way I used to figure it would. I sold the house, I auctioned off the furniture, I put all the paintings and boxes in the barn, I erased my old name and took my initials off everything, and I got on the train and left.

I can't say I actually chose the city I was going to; it was actually and truly the only one available at the moment; I hadn't ever been there and it seemed a good size and I had enough in my pocket to pay the fare. When I got off the train I took a deep breath of the dirty city air and carried my suitcase and my pocketbook and my fur stole—Hughie wasn't selfish, I don't want to give a wrong impression; I always had everything I wanted—and stopped at the counter for coffee and doughnuts.

“My sister might want to rent a room to a nice lady,” this woman said to me, “she's got this little crippled kid.”

So I said, “Where does your sister live, dear?”

That was where I got my first direction, you see. Smith Street. Where I was going to be living for a while.

The city is a pretty city, particularly after living in the country; I have nothing actually against trees and grass, of course, but Hughie always wanted to live in the country. There was a zoo somewhere in this city, and a college, and a few big stores, and streetcars, which I believe you don't often see any more. I knew there was an art gallery—who could be married to Hughie, that painter, and not know about an art gallery?—and a symphony orchestra, and surely a little theater group, mostly wives and fairies; if I liked the city and I stayed I might look up the little theater group; there was an art movie and I hoped at least one good restaurant; I am a first-rate cook.

More than anything else, more than art movies or zoos, I wanted to talk to people; I was starved for strangers. I began with the woman at the counter in the railroad station.

“She has this little crippled kid.”

“Where does your sister live, dear?”

“She was married to the same man for twenty-seven years and all he left her was the house and this little kid, he's crippled. Me, I don't like a man like that.”

“They don't leave you with much, and that's a fact.”

“After twenty-seven years married to the same man she shouldn't have to take in roomers.”

“But if one of her roomers turns out to be me it might all have been worthwhile.”

“That's where I've been, visiting my sister.” She put down her coffee cup. “I come to visit her. And then I take the train back home. You have to take the train to get from my house to hers.” She looked at me carefully, as though she might be wondering whether I could remember my own name. “She lives on Smith Street. You'll know the house. It's big. She's got this sign ROOMS.”

“At least he left her a big house,” I said.

“Up and down stairs all the time, keeping up a big house these days. She's not getting any younger, and the kid.”

“Well, we're none of us,” I said.

After that I talked to a man on a corner; he was waiting for a streetcar. “Does this streetcar go to Smith Street?” I asked him.

“What streetcar?” He turned and looked down the street.

“The one you're waiting for; this is a car stop, isn't it?”

He looked again, and we marveled together at the delights of the city, where you could stand on a corner and a streetcar would come. “Where you say?” he asked me.

“Smith Street.”

“You live there?”

“Yes. I got this little crippled kid. Big house.”

“No,” he said, “you get that car across the street. Because across the street is going the other way. How long you say you've lived there?”

“Twenty-seven years. With the same man.”

“He any better at catching streetcars than you are?”

“He's a motorman,” I told him. “I try to avoid his route.”

This clearly sounded right to him. “Women always checking up,” he said, and turned away from me.

Then I talked to an old lady in a bookshop, who was so very tired that she leaned her elbows on piles of books as we talked; she told me that the city was hell on books, because of the college, and they stole a thousand paperbacks a year. “They can't seem to think of them as books,” she said, furious, “books they don't dare steal because of the covers. Also they know I'm watching.”

“Do you sell a lot of books?”

“It's the college,” she said. “They come here to get an education.” She laughed, furious. “No one speaks English any more,” she said. She took her elbows off the pile of books and went back to sit down on a dirty old chair in the back of the store. “I'm watching,” she called out, “I'm still watching,” but I was leaving.

I went to the correct side of the street and put my suitcase down and waited carrying my pocketbook and my fur stole until a streetcar came by reading SMITH STREET and I decided well this is certainly the streetcar they meant when they said it went to Smith Street. I swung my suitcase on and climbed up behind it; you know, they know old ladies—not me and little crippled kids and pregnant women and maybe sick people with broken arms are all going to have to ride on those streetcars; you'd think they didn't want passengers, the way they make those steps. I suppose the salary they pay the motorman he wouldn't help anyone anyway. He looked at me; he was sitting down driving his streetcar and I was climbing on with my suitcase and my pocketbook and my fur stole, and I figured if he wasn't going to help me I wasn't going to help him, so I said, “Does this streetcar go to Smith Street?”

He looked at me; I must say I like it better when they look at you; a lot of the time people seem to be scared of finding out that other people have real faces, as though if you looked at a stranger clearly and honestly and with both eyes you might find yourself learning something you didn't actually want to know. “Lady,” he said, “I promise you. This streetcar goes to Smith Street every trip. That's why,” he said, and he was not smiling, “that's why it says so on the front.”

“You're sure?” I was not smiling either and he knew he had met someone as stubborn as he was, so he quit.

“Yes, lady,” he said. “I'm almost positive.”

“Thank you,” I said. It never pays to let a minute like that slip by; every word counts. I might never see that motorman again, but on the other hand, I might be living on Smith Street and ride home with him every night. He might get to calling me by whatever name I finally picked out and I might take to asking him every night how his wife's asthma was today and did his daughter break up with that guy who stole the money and I might take to asking him every night, “Say, driver, does this streetcar go to Smith Street?”

And he might say, every night, not smiling, “Yes, lady, it surely does.”

Hughie would not have thought any of that was funny. In case he ever does come back asking I will certainly remember not to tell him.

There is a kind of controlled madness to streetcars; they swing along as though they haven't quite come to terms with tracks yet, and haven't really decided whether tracks are here to stay or streetcars are here to stay on tracks; they swing and tilt and knock people around, especially people who are trying to hold onto a suitcase and a pocketbook and a fur stole. I sat there sliding around on the seat and wondering if anyone was laughing at me and wondering if maybe I was the streetcar type after all, and outside the window the city went by. I saw the biggest store in town and thought that someday very soon I would be in there, and I might say, “Well, if you haven't got this blouse in a size forty-four I'll just run across the street and try there.” I would have to have a name before I could open any charge accounts anywhere. “I'd rather you didn't carry money,” Hughie used to say, “I want you to go into a store and pick out what you want and tell them your name and walk out; I don't care if it's a thousand dollars, just tell them your name and take what you want.” There were hotels; I might come back for a visit someday, and see all my old friends on Smith Street; I might go tea-dancing at the Splendid Hotel, although one letter was missing from its marquee; I might drop into the lobby of the Royal Hotel to hear who was being paged, and pick up a name that way. I saw a drugstore where I might get a prescription filled and buy shampoo, I saw a shop where I might buy records and a place to get my shoes repaired and a laundry and a candy store and a grocery and a leather shop and a pet shop and a toy store. It was a proper little city, correct and complete, set up exactly for my private use, fitted out with quite the right people, waiting for me to come. I slid around on the streetcar seat and thought that they had done it all very well.

I must say that motorman got the last word. I was still looking out the window when he turned around and yelled, “Smith Street.” In case there was any doubt about who he was yelling at he pointed his finger at me.

“How is your wife's asthma?” I asked him when I came down the aisle with my suitcase and my pocketbook and my fur stole.

“Better, thank you,” he said. “Watch your step.”

It was Smith Street all right; no one had lied to me yet. They wanted to make sure I got there as planned; there was a sign on the corner saying SMITH STREET.

I was glad to see that there were trees; far down, at the end, I could see what looked like a little park, and on either side of Smith Street going down to the park there were trees. I thought I would enjoy coming home under the trees, in the rain, perhaps, or in the fall when the leaves were dropping. I thought I would enjoy hearing the sound of the leaves brushing against my window. The houses were the kind no one has built for a good twenty-seven years, big and ample and made for people who liked to sit on their own front porches and watch their neighbors. There were lawns and bushes and garden hoses, there were dogs. The house I wanted was on my right, about halfway down the block; it was a big house with a sign saying ROOMS although I didn't see any little kids looking crippled. I stood across the street from the house for a few minutes; here I am, I thought, here I am.

No one, anywhere, anytime, had given me any word of any other place to go. This was the only objective I had; if I didn't go in here they wouldn't tell me any other place to go. I wondered which room was going to be mine and whether I would look down from its window onto the street and see myself standing there looking up and waiting; by the time I looked out of the window I would have to have a name.

Right then I wished I could sit down for a minute and maybe have a little something to eat; nothing looks sillier than a forty-four-year-old woman standing on a sidewalk with a suitcase and a pocketbook and a fur stole trying to think up a name for herself. Somewhere down the street someone called a dog, calling “Here, Rover,” and I thought that Rover was probably a good name but it was not actually exactly what I was looking for; I thought I might stop someone going by and ask for their name but no one wants to give away a name that might be terribly important to keep, and even if they did tell it to me I might not be able to spell it or even pronounce it right and if you've got a name at all you've got to be able to say it out loud. I thought of Laura, but Laura was my mother's name. I didn't want any more of Hughie and his names, and Bertha was my grandmother and who wants to be named Bertha, particularly after her grandmother? I thought of Muriel but that just sounds like someone who gets raped and robbed in an alley. I once had a cat named Edward, and because he was silver I changed his name to Stargazer and then in the spring to Robin, and when I got tired, which I did very soon, of a cat named Robin, I tried to change his name to Edward again and he got sick and died. You have to be terribly careful with names; one too many and you lose.

I thought of Jean and Helen and Margaret, but I knew people called by all those names, and perhaps I would not enjoy answering to them; I thought of Gertrude and Goneril and I thought of Diana, which was dead wrong and Minerva, which was closer but silly. I knew I had to think of something right away, and I got a little chill at the back of my neck; what is really more frightening than being without a name, nothing to call yourself, nothing to say when they ask you who you are? Then it fell on me; I heard it: Angela. It was right, Angela was the name I had come all this way to find.

The rest of it was easy; I had said it already. Angela Motorman. Mrs. Angela Motorman.

So Mrs. Angela Motorman walked slowly and decently up the walk to the fine old house with the sign in the window saying ROOMS. She was carrying her suitcase and her pocketbook and her fur stole, and she stopped for a minute to look the house over very carefully; a lady cannot be too wary of the company she may find herself among, a lady chooses her place of residence with caution. As she set her foot on the steps she put her shoulders back and took a deep breath: Mrs. Angela Motorman, who never walked on earth before.

I must say she had the good sense to offer me a cup of tea right away, once she found out I was a friend of her sister's, and in case you are wondering about me having lunch on the train and coffee and a doughnut in the station, and now a cup of tea and cookies, let me just remark that I have plenty of room to put it all.

“And what do you do, Mrs. Motorman?” she asked me.

“I dabble in the supernatural,” I told her.

Her name was Mrs. Faun; we both had names. “How is my sister?” she wanted to know.

“Doing well,” I said. “Of course, she has her troubles like the rest of us.”

I had taken to the house right away; I like most houses, and this was one of the best. The staircase was good, wide and clearly worn by a hundred trips up and down every day, up and down, up and down till your feet could fall off. It was a solid house, a devil to clean, but prepared to stand right where it was forever; enough people had lived here to make the air very alive; I was ready for any number to come around asking, but first I had to deal with Mrs. Faun.

“I've just buried my husband,” I said.

“I've just buried mine,” she said.

“Isn't it a relief?” I said.

“What?” she said.

“It was a very sad occasion,” I said.

“You're right,” she said, “it's a relief.”

She had a jaw and she served a strong cup of tea and I would not say a bad word against a woman who put out her own homemade sugar cookies for a guest; I am an excellent cook. The tea was served in the kitchen; as soon as I said I was a friend of her sister's she said, quite rightly, “I was just having a cup of tea; come on in the kitchen.”

When I tried to say it for the first time I was not actually certain how it was going to sound, because no one had ever said it before in the history of this earth, and I thought to myself, I'm giving birth. “I'm Mrs. Angela Motorman,” I said.

“I'm Mrs. Faun,” she said right back. “I was just having a cup of tea.”

I thought that Mrs. Faun and I were going to be all right together. I didn't know yet whether she had a silly laugh, or went on tapping her fingers on the table, but I liked her kitchen, which had no gadgets, and I liked her stove, which was still warm from making sugar cookies, and I liked her jaw.

“I'm not saying I want a room and I'm not saying I don't,” I told her, “but if I did, what would you have to show me?”

“I'm not saying I have a room and I'm not saying I don't,” she said right back, “but if you wanted to look I could let you see a very pretty little place.”

Oh, I was going to be all right with Mrs. Faun. I liked her jaw and I liked her stove and I liked her house and if she wanted to have a little crippled kid I was certainly not going to stand in her way; “It's hard for a woman alone,” I said.

“And what do you do, Mrs. Motorman?”

“I dabble in the supernatural.”

“My niece had this meningitis,” she said as though I had asked some kind of a question. “Let me fill your cup. She had this meningitis and it got to her heart. They knew it was going to, of course, but they never told her. She had it for years before she found out it got to her heart.”

“My cousin had mercury poisoning,” I said. “That goes directly to the heart, of course. He only lasted for about three days.”

“I had a cousin something like that,” she said. “You mentioned what a short time they last. Only in her case it all went to the brain. Reddest face I ever saw and she died not knowing one of us.”

“My aunt was the same,” I said. “Only she died of pneumonia; that's a very quick one. It catches you without any warning, you swell up, and there you go.”

“Bloated,” she said, “like my nephew, only his was alcohol.”

“And then there was this friend of mine,” I said. “She had cirrhosis of the scalp. They don't have a cure yet for any of those things, you know, and they run right through you. I hate to think of the way my friend went right on suffering until the very end.”

“Very often the end is the most to be desired,” she said. “There was a friend of mine, we all couldn't wait for her to go, but she had cancer. Incurable.”

“I had a friend who had cancer,” I said, “but they cut off her right leg.”

“That's never enough,” she said. “Mark me, she'll be back for her other leg. I knew a woman once who lost both arms that way.”

“My uncle fell under a truck,” I said. I wondered if I should tell her about my great-aunt.

“I'm sorry about your uncle,” she said. “Do you want a room or don't you?”

“I do.”

“And what do you do, Mrs. Motorman?”

“I dabble in the supernatural. Traffic with spirits. Seances, messages, psychiatric advice, that kind of thing.”

“I never had one of those before,” Mrs. Faun said. “I'm not saying I haven't had all kinds. You rent out rooms, it's sometimes a surprise what you get.”

“I never lived in a room before.”

“You won't find it terribly difficult,” she said, not smiling. “All you have to do is pay for it regularly. I'd be willing to add some meals, but that would be extra.”

“Perhaps I could give a hand with the cooking; I'm a fine cook.”

“I'm not sure but what that would be extra too,” she said. “You may not cook in your room.”

“I promise,” I said.

“You may not smoke in your bed.”

“I promise.”

“You may not make noise late at night.”

“I promise.”

“These are all safety precautions,” she explained to me. “Thou shalt not—I mean, you may not keep dirty pets.”

“I promise.”

“You may not spread any contagious diseases. Although the room I plan to show you has a private bath. Linen provided, we do the heavy cleaning, and anything you raise by way of spirits you have to put back yourself.”

Oh, I liked Mrs. Faun. She turned her head suddenly and then she stood up and went over to the back door of the kitchen, the door leading outside, and opened it. “Little early today,” she said, and “Must have run all the way,” which was clearly some kind of a private joke because there was laughter. I helped myself to another cookie, and then Mrs. Faun came back pushing the wheelchair; there was a ramp built outside the door so she could push it right inside without difficulty. “This is my son Tom,” Mrs. Faun said, “Tom, this is Mrs. Motorman.” Once again it sounded all right; I was going to learn to answer to it.

“Hi,” the boy in the wheelchair said. He seemed to be about twelve years old, although it's hard to tell with a boy sitting down. “Any cookies left?”

“I got my share,” I said. “Someday if you want me to I'll make you my special chocolate cake; it's got five layers.”

“Okay,” he said, and then he laughed. “Motorman's a funny name,” he said.

“I just made it up,” I told him. “You just home from school?”

“I like school,” he said, “but they're always surprised I'm not smarter, because I don't play baseball and stuff, they always think I'm going to be smarter than anyone else. And I'm not.”

“Maybe if you practice,” I said.

“One kid pushes me down the street every morning and another kid pushes me back home in the afternoon. They do all the pushing and I ride both ways and it's great, but I'm not as smart as they think I ought to be.”

“You're smart enough for your own good,” Mrs. Faun said. She brought him a glass of milk and pushed the plate of cookies a little closer to him. “I'll go and check your room,” she said to me.

“I'm pretty smart,” he said to me anxiously. “I'm not stupid, of course.”

“I'm pretty smart, but I never got pushed back and forth to school.”

“Well, I'm planning to be a scholar, and I better get started pretty soon. You know any Spanish?”

“No.”

“I want to learn Spanish and French and Italian and Russian and then Latin and Greek and be a scholar. So far I only know a little Spanish, but I'm lazy.”

“One of these days I might push you to the movies,” I said.

“I would like that,” he said. “Perhaps a movie in Spanish or French to improve my accent.”

We each had another cookie. Then he said, “What do you study, Mrs. Motorman?”

“I was married to a painter.”

“Was he any good?”

“He was lousy.”

“Is he dead?”

“Yes.”

“How long you think I ought to go on studying Spanish before I start French? They're both good languages.”

“If you're so lazy why not give up the whole thing?”

“Well,” he said, thinking, “I suppose it's because they all keep waiting for me to be so smart. I wouldn't play baseball if I could, you can hurt yourself playing those games. But I don't mind being a scholar.”

“Look,” I said, “I'm not used to talking to kids.”

“Oh, that's all right,” he said.

“I don't know why you can't just sit around and read books.”

Mrs. Faun came back and said “Drink your milk there,” and “Your room is ready.” She touched the boy on the head and he said, “Hey, Mrs. Motorman and I are going to the movies someday,” and Mrs. Faun looked at me for a minute and then said, “I think you're going to like the room.”

I brought a couple of cookies upstairs with me, just in case. My room was perfectly square, which was good. My name was Mrs. Angela Motorman and this was where I was going to live, in a square room in Mrs. Faun's house on Smith Street. I did not know as yet what I was going to add to this room; it already held a bed and a dresser and two chairs and a pretty little desk, something like the pretty little desk I had last seen disappearing into the back of a station wagon when I had my auction. There was nothing in these desk drawers; I did not know as yet what I was going to put in them. There was a little bookcase which would hold, I thought, perhaps eleven books; I would have to choose my eleven books very carefully; when I found them I could write “Angela Motorman” on the flyleaves. I put my underwear and stockings into the dresser drawers, and hung my two dresses and my fur stole in the closet; someday I would go to the department stores and buy new clothes; I put my brush and comb on the dresser and put my sleeping pills on the bedside table and put my reading glasses beside them. I had no pets, no address books, no small effects to set around on tables or pin on walls, I had no lists of friends to keep in touch with and no souvenirs; all I had was myself.

I like people, but I have never needed companions; Hughie was my only mistake.

I set an armchair next to the window of my room, and I was pleased to see that I did indeed look out over the trees and onto the spot on the street where I had stood not long ago wondering over a name; “It's all right, Angela,” I said very softly out the window, “it's all right, you made it, you came in and it's all right; you got here after all.” And outside the dim nameless creature named herself Mrs. Angela Motorman and came steadily to the door.

I have a real feeling for shapes; I like things square, and my room was finely square. Even though I couldn't cook there I thought I could be happy. I wanted the barest rock bottom of a room I could have, I wanted nothing but a place to sleep and a place to sit and a place to put my things; any decorating done to my environment is me.

One reason is, the first time it happened was in a square room, my own room when I was about twelve. Before then, most of it was just whisperings and little half-thoughts, the way a child almost notices something, almost remembers, but this time it was real and I was not dreaming; I know when I'm dreaming. I sat up in bed in the middle of the night, and heard my own voice saying “What? What?” and then I heard another voice, not coming out of my own head—I know what comes out of my own head—saying “Find Rosalind Bleeker. Tell her Sid says hello.” Three times I heard that crazy voice say “Tell her Sid says hello.”

I knew Rosalind Bleeker—in all the years since I've never forgotten her name—and because she was four or five years older and in high school I had a little trouble finding her the next day, but I caught her when she was walking home. I remember I had trouble getting her attention; I was just a little kid, and she was popular and pretty and always laughing. She was wearing a white blouse and a blue skirt and a charm bracelet. Her hair was curly. She was carrying her biology textbook and a blue-covered notebook. Her shoes were white. Her eyes were blue. She wore a little lipstick. I pulled at her sleeve and said “Rosalind, hey, Rosalind,” not very loud because she was a high-school girl. She turned around and looked down at me and frowned, because I was a kid and she was a high-school girl and here I was pulling at her sleeve. “Listen, Rosalind,” I said, “listen. I'm supposed to tell you Sid says to say hello.” “What?” she said. “Sid says to say hello,” I said, and then ran, because I had nothing more to say and I felt silly. I heard later she went home and hanged herself. I don't know.

Anyway, that was the first time. After that there were lots more, some more real than others. There was the time I said to my mother, “Grandma just picked up the phone to call you,” and she said, “That's nice,” just as the phone rang. She looked at me funny; they always did after a while.

“I dabble in the supernatural,” I told Mrs. Faun; she thought I was making some kind of a joke.

I quit when I married Hughie; you'd have to.

I remember another time when I sat by the window and my mother, who ought to have known better by then, said to me, “Why are you always brooding, staring out the window, never doing anything?”

“I'm watching the peacocks walking on the lawn,” I said.

“But you ought to be out playing with the other children; why do you suppose we moved here to a nice neighborhood, so you could always sit looking out the window instead of playing with the other kids? Haven't you got any friends? Doesn't anyone like you?”

“I'm watching the peacocks,” I tried to tell her. “They're walking on the lawn and I'm watching them.”

“You ought to be out with your friends. What are peacocks doing on our lawn, ruining the grass?” and she came over to look out the window; as I say, she ought to have known better.

Sometimes I knew and sometimes I didn't; there would be times when I lay on my stomach on the floor watching creatures playing under the dining-room table, and I knew then of course that my mother wasn't going to see them and was maybe going to put her foot through one when she came by to say why did they move to a nice neighborhood and I wouldn't go out and make friends. Sometimes my good square room would be so full I just lay in bed and laughed. Sometimes weeks would go by and I would be reading some specially interesting book, or painting, or following people every day after school, and nothing would come at all; sometimes they followed me; once an old man followed me, but he turned out to be real. I could see what the cat saw.

When I was about sixteen I began to get self-conscious about all of it; it wasn't that I minded them coming around asking and following me everywhere I went; most sixteen-year-old girls like to be followed, but by then I knew no one else was going to see them and sometimes I felt like a fool; you don't go around staring at empty air all the time, not when you're sixteen years old you don't, not without people beginning to notice. “Do you need glasses?” my mother used to ask me, or “Can't you for heaven's sake stop gawking at nothing and shut your mouth and comb your hair and get out with the other kids?” Then sometimes for weeks at a time I would think that they had gone away, maybe for good, and I'd start taking care of my hair and putting polish on my nails and hanging around the soda shop or going to a football game, and then first thing I knew I'd be talking to someone and a face would come between us and a mouth would open saying some crazy thing, and I'd be watching and listening and whomever I had been talking to would wait for a few minutes and then get edgy and walk away while I was still listening to some other voice. After a while I just stopped talking to anybody.

That's not a good way for a girl to grow up. It's easy to say that if I knew then what I know now I could have handled it better; how can anyone handle things if her head is full of voices and her world is full of things no one else can see? I'm not complaining.

I sat in my pleasant square room at Mrs. Faun's house and thought about it all. Ever since I can remember, I thought as quietly as I could, I have been seeing and hearing things no one else could see and hear. By now I can control the nuisance to some extent. It disappeared entirely when I married Hughie; I have reason to believe now that it is coming back. I sat in Mrs. Faun's house and thought what good did it do to sell the house and find a new name; they don't care what your name is when they come around asking.

At first I tried to point them out to people; I was even foolish enough at first to think other people just hadn't noticed; “Look at that,” I would say, “look, right over there, it's a funny man.” It didn't take long for my mother to put a stop to that; “There isn't any funny man anywhere,” she would say, and jerk on my arm, “what kind of a sewer do you have for a mind?” Once I tried to tell a neighbor about it; it was quite accidental, because I rarely told anyone anything. He was sitting on his front porch one evening in summer and I had been lying on the grass on our lawn, watching small lights go and come among the grass blades, and listening to a kind of singing—sometimes, especially in summer, it was a kind of pleasant world I lived in—and he heard me laughing. He asked me to come and sit on his front porch and he gave me a glass of lemonade, and when he asked me what I had been doing I went ahead and told him. I told him about seeing and hearing, and he listened, which is more than anyone else ever did. “You're clairvoyant,” he told me, and I always remembered that; he probably knew less than nothing about it, but he listened and said I was clairvoyant; later he told my mother I ought to be taken to some special clinic and examined, and for about three days she decided I was pregnant. I never talked to him again; I wanted to, once in a while, but he never spoke to me after that.

I knew a lot about people, a lot that they never knew I knew, but I never seemed to have much sense, probably because one thing I never really knew was whether what I was doing was real or not.

The house, I later found out, was almost all square. It had three floors and a basement, and neat trim porches on three sides; whoever built that house had either very little imagination or a mind much like mine, because everything was neatly cornered and as near as possible the same size; that is, one door matched the next almost perfectly and where there were doors they were as often as possible right in the middle of the wall, with an equal space on either side of them. The windows were perfectly correct.

When I asked Mrs. Faun later she told me that there were five people renting rooms in the house; I thought it was wrong that they should be an odd number, but since I was the fifth I could hardly protest, and in any case she had only six rooms to rent. On the top floor were a Mr. Brand who was a bookkeeper, and a Mr. Cabot who was, Mrs. Faun believed, in merchandising. On the second floor were old Mrs. Flanner, who kept a bookshop, Mr. Campbell, who was in transit, and me. Mrs. Faun kept the ground floor for herself. “I always wanted it that way,” she told me, “I always used to dream of the time when I could live on the ground floor; I had it planned for years. I always thought the dining room would work out better as a bedroom, and I hated the idea of going upstairs every night and leaving it behind. It's more comfortable, it's more convenient, and it's perfectly safe.”

“Safe?”

“In case of fire. I can get out.”

I may say that in all the time I was in that house I never met Mr. Campbell, who was in transit.

We were a gay crew, I soon discovered. Here I was, with one suitcase and a fur stole and a pocketbook with plenty of money, but old Mrs. Flanner had had her same room for nine years and she had a television set, all her own furniture, including a Chinese lacquer table, purple drapes on the windows, and a silver tea service. Brand and Cabot on the top floor took cocktails in one another's room every day at six. Mrs. Faun was apt to invite anyone at random to Sunday dinner; she was almost as good a cook as I am. Brand played the cello, and Mrs. Flanner used to sing at one time before her voice cracked. Mrs. Flanner also played the dirtiest game of bridge that Mrs. Faun had ever seen. Brand had a small mustache, Cabot collected Coalport china, Mrs. Faun disliked garlic and consequently never made a decent salad dressing until the day she died; Brand fell over the bottom step of the staircase every night regularly, coming home at five-thirty. He was neither drunk nor clumsy, he never fell over anything else that anyone ever knew of, he never dropped anything or spilled anything, but every night at five-thirty Mr. Brand tripped over the bottom step of the staircase. You could set your clock by Brand falling over the bottom step of the staircase, Mrs. Faun used to say, if it was important to you to set your clock at five-thirty. Brand and Cabot and Flanner and I usually took most of our meals at a little restaurant around the corner, but every Friday night Brand went to his mother's and every Saturday night Cabot took out a girl; he had been taking her out for four years now, Mrs. Faun said, but thought marriage was too confining. I liked Mrs. Faun. I had almost nothing to do, so I got to helping with the housework and we'd knock off and sit around the kitchen drinking coffee and eating cookies; Mrs. Faun baked every second morning, before anyone was up, and one thing I did like about living in that house was waking up to the smell of cookies baking.

My room, as I say, was absolutely, perfectly square; I measured it. I admire a house with a good square room, and when I unpacked I knew I was going to stay. First I unpacked my picture, my painting; it had been painted with Hughie's paints but I painted it myself. “Keep it around if you like,” Hughie said, “you're proud of it, all right. Don't think I hate all painting styles but my own.” So my own painting went on the wall, although Mrs. Faun said that it would cost to repair the hole. Cabot liked my painting, and Brand. Mrs. Flanner poked it with her finger and said it took her back. Mrs. Faun said it would cost to repair the hole.

“What do you do, Mrs. Motorman?” Brand asked me.

“A little shoplifting, sometimes,” I told him. “Some meddling.”

“What brought you to our city?”

“Curiosity,” I told him.

Brand and Cabot asked me up for cocktails, and Mrs. Faun asked me for Sunday dinner, and Mrs. Flanner asked me if I played bridge and I said no. I walked to the end of Smith Street and around in the little park, under the trees. One day I went back to the streetcar and got on and went into the center of the city, where I went into the first large store and looked at blouses.

“If you don't have this blouse in a size forty-four,” I told the salesgirl, “I'll just run across the street and look.” I didn't go across the street, actually; I spoke to a lady in a drugstore where I stopped to have a sandwich and a milk shake. “They're all chemicals now,” she said to me. “You can't even buy pure vanilla. All chemicals.”

“In a drugstore you'd expect chemicals.”

“Everywhere. You think you're drinking chocolate in that milk shake? Nothing but chemicals.”

“I didn't actually come into the city for a milk shake, though; I came to buy a blouse.”

“Well, they're chemical. Clothes, food, drink, plants growing in nothing but water, laboratories overcrowded, it's a bad world.”

“Bourbon—”

“It's all this mad race into space,” she said, and went away.

When I got onto the streetcar to go back, it said SMITH STREET in big letters on the front; “Does this streetcar go to Smith Street?” I asked the motorman, and he looked at me for a minute and then he said very quietly, “Yes, ma'am, it surely does.”

“Thank you,” I said. “How is your wife's asthma?”

“I am not married,” he said, “thank God.”

When I decided it was time for me to give a seance, I spoke to Mrs. Faun first, of course, since it was her house and I had no idea how she might feel about people coming around asking in her own house; “I thought I might hold a kind of a small seance,” I said to her.

“What would that include?” she asked me.

“Well, I sit in the middle, and everyone sits around, and we might have sherry. And then I give messages.”

“Who provides the sherry?”

“Everyone has some kind of a question they'd like to get answered. Some kind of a question can only be answered from beyond.”

I was sure she was going to say “Beyond what?” so I said quickly, “You don't have to believe if you don't want to.”

“Thank you,” she said. “I'll let you have the cooking sherry.”

“May I use the little parlor?”

“That means I'd have to come,” Mrs. Faun said. “Unless I choose to sit in the kitchen all the time.”

“I'd be honored if you'd come.”

“Who else would be here?”

I had made a little sign reading MESSAGES OBTAINED. QUESTIONS ANSWERED. FORTUNES and tacked it up in the bookshop I found my first day. Several people had been interested. The bookshop lady had promised to let them know. So I told Mrs. Faun, “I think there will be several people. And of course anyone from the house.”

“Not Tom. I don't allow him seances.”

“Has the question ever come up before?”

“Not that I ever thought it would. But he can read all right in his room. He doesn't listen in.”

“One reason I want to use the little parlor is that chair.”

Mrs. Faun actually laughed. “It used to be my husband's favorite chair,” she said. “Night after night.”

“Did he ever get any manifestations, sitting there?”

“Not that he thought it worthwhile mentioning. But it's a good chair. I don't much care for it myself, but I could sell it for money.”

It was a good chair. It had a back higher than my head, and the arms were solid, and altogether it looked something like a throne of which the seat had been amply seasoned by Mr. Faun's bottom. Whenever the door of the little parlor was open I sneaked in and sat down for a minute; I liked that chair.

“Are you sure,” Mrs. Faun asked me, “that you are not tampering with things better left alone? Are you sure that you know what you are doing? Are you sure, Mrs. Motorman, that you are not stirring up some kind of trouble that will hang around my house?”

“It's exactly like taking a long-distance call,” I told her. “Once you hang up, it's over.”

“I never knew a long-distance call didn't mean trouble for someone.”

The little parlor had drapes, which Mrs. Faun never closed, which is why the dust rose when I closed them, which is why I sneezed and Mrs. Faun scowled; she kept a clean house, generally. I moved the fine chair into the center of the room, and we put a few dining-room chairs around, not too many because I wasn't sure how many would come and I didn't want to look anxious, but enough so no one would stand; no one stood around in Mrs. Faun's house; perhaps because Tom was always sitting down she thought people standing were uncomfortable. Although I have plenty of money I put a large orange bowl, in which Mrs. Faun usually kept apples, on a low table moved just enough out from the wall to be noticeable. “People expect this,” I told Mrs. Faun.

“I'll bring the sherry and the glasses,” she said, “and you can pay me out of the pot.”

“It's really a hobby of mine, mostly. But if it does people good, why keep it to myself?”

“If more people kept more things to themselves this world would be a better place.” Mrs. Faun gave the curtain a little shake. “How you can find dust beats me,” she said.

I don't know what the bookstore lady could have said around the bookstore, or even what Mrs. Faun might have said around the neighborhood, because when I came to give my seance there were eight people, which made us nine altogether, which is good. I had decided to wear my long dark-blue dress. It doesn't fit as well as it used to, but who says a psychic has to be smart? It has these long sleeves, and I wore my pearls; I will say that for Hughie, he didn't stint me.

All right, I thought, I'll try it once anyway. They all sat there watching me as though they dared me to put something over on them, the watchful, the eager, the perceptive. I realized I was stalling; there were a number of things I wanted to do right now a lot more than lean back and close my eyes in the face of those watching people; I knew they would keep on staring at me after I was gone, and I hated that. I could have said right then that it was a joke, but they would have believed me. “I don't know anything about all this,” came to my mind, “please, all of you, go away and don't try to make me do something I hate.” But of course I didn't; I looked each of them right in the eye, thinking I hate you I hate you I hope you are brutally disappointed, and I nodded at Mrs. Faun, who at least was almost snarling out loud, and I leaned back and felt the worn velvet of the chair against the back of my neck and wondered who was clamoring around just inside waiting to come around asking, and I closed my eyes. I could hear them breathing. Easy, slow, contemptuous, that would be Mrs. Faun, waiting to be shown. Then the others, quick and eager, a little woman watching, the men aware, alert, dishonest.

I was in a great hall, lofty, pillared, reaching into the distance. There were flowers in great pots, and—the old crystal palace, maybe?—tall glittering walls; there were many people. I waited quietly, not knowing who was going to come around asking, and waited and waited, and then found one man singled out, almost drifting to where I waited, almost moving without movement, surely without sound. “A tall man,” I said, and heard my own voice remotely, “a tall man, wanting something. He has gray hair. He is not very old, but he has gray hair.”

“My father,” someone said.

“My brother,” someone else said.

“Excuse me. My father.”

“He says,” and I raised my voice, hearing it speak out there, to them, while I listened inside, “he says to take up the book he left behind, the book that he held in his hands near the end, the book he was holding in his hands. He says to take up the book and turn to page... page... page... it has an eight and a five.”

“Dad?”

“I beg your pardon. My brother. I know the very book.”

“An eight and a five; find the page and there will be a message—a letter?—a message. He says he left a message.”

“Ask him if he is happy. Tell him it's his sister asking.”

“Excuse me—”

“He does not know the word happy. He is here, and that is all. He is going now.”

“I'm sure it was my father; if I had been given a chance to speak—”

“Someone is here,” I said. I heard my voice saying it. “Someone is here asking for Alice? Anna? Angela?” I knew even then there was something wrong with Angela, but I had forgotten what. “Alice?”

“My wife? Her name is Agnes.”

“She is ill, is she not? Someone is asking if she is better, if her illness has abated; someone is asking that you tell her the old medicine is better. Someone wants her to know that she is being taken care of, someone is over her now, comforting her.”

“But the old medicine didn't—”

“Tell her someone is caring for her. She will be better.”

“Will you ask my father to come back again? I must speak to him, really.”

“There are many many many here, some of them wanting to speak, some of them moving away. One who wants to speak is asking for a daughter, but it is not a father who wants a daughter; someone is asking for a daughter. Is there a daughter here?”

“My mother? My mother wants to talk to me? What for?”

“Are you well? Are you contented? Someone is asking if you are well.”

“It's not my mother then, because she—”

“Gone now. Some are pressing close to me, some are far away. Here is someone with a message. Do not forget old Ginger.”

“What?”

“Do not forget old Ginger.” My Lord, I thought, from somewhere far away, old Ginger was my cat. Messages for myself. Better quit soon. “Do not forget old Ginger,” I said, as though I ever could. “Here is someone asking, asking; a message for a wife.”

“I don't want it,” Mrs. Faun said; I could hear her voice thin and annoyed. “Tell him to go away again; I don't want to hear anything he has to say.”

“Someone is here, someone who wants to ask about a little child. Was the little child lost? Did it ever come home again? Where is the little child?”

“Get my father back; we don't know any little—”

“Now there is a message here, a message for T. L.”

“Me? The first initial's really J., but they always called me Teddy; I guess it's for me.”

“Good fortune in store for you, T. L., great good fortune is being warned against; do not be deceived.”

So that was my first seance; it couldn't have been a very good one, since no one said anything, and there was only thirty-five cents in the pot; I had to pay fifty cents more out of my own pocket for the sherry.

“All they talk about is death and dying,” I said to Mrs. Faun after she had seen them out. “And they are cheap.”

“What do you expect?” She opened the drapes, blowing dust off her nose.

“They could take a little bit more interest.”

“If they were interested in real life they wouldn't have come to listen to you. You'll find out.”

I thought she was being unnecessarily dreary, but that, as it turned out, was going to be Mrs. Faun's way. “They're all crazy,” she said, “all they want is to be told what to do. They wait for some crackpot to give them the word.”

“If by crackpot you mean—”

“I mean what I mean,” Mrs. Faun said. “If the shoe fits, Mrs. Motorman.”

Well, I don't want you to think that Mrs. Faun and I came right out and quarreled all the time. We kind of sharpened our nails on each other, that was all, and most of the time we finished off our arguments laughing together over a cup of tea, although I must say I was surprised when I began getting a weekly bill from Mrs. Faun, in addition to the rent for the room, for “tea, cookies, etc.”

“I thought you invited me,” I said to her the first week.

“It won't hurt you,” she said. “I get what I can.”

I started following people after a day or so in the city; one thing is certain, you can't find your way around a strange city without someone to show you where to go, and when all you know is a Mrs. Faun who won't step out of her front parlor for a bomb explosion on the street outside, you pretty well have to get the way from strangers. The first person I followed was an old fellow I picked up outside a restaurant; he had been eating caviar, and I like to follow someone who is good and full of caviar, although I don't care for it myself; it seemed that he might lead me to a far more interesting place than any I might find by myself, and, in a sense, he did; “Why are you following me?” he asked, turning suddenly on me at a street corner; I was not as good at following people then as I became later.

“Because you were eating caviar,” I said. Sometimes the truth doesn't hurt.

“I like caviar.”

“I don't.”

“Where did you plan to follow me?” He was still bewildered, but I thought amused; I am not very terrifying to look at, I believe. In any case, he was clearly a man without a guilty conscience, or at least no kind of conscience that being followed by me might bother. Perhaps being followed by a lovely young nineteen-year-old boy might have bothered him some.

“Come and have tea with me,” he said. I swear, he took out a cardcase and handed me a card; I don't think I have ever known anyone to do that before. “I'd like to,” I told him, “it will save me money with Mrs. Faun.”

There was the day I tried my hand at shoplifting; it was particularly important because of the weather; it was one of those winter days which suddenly dreams of spring, when the sky is blue and soft and clear, and the wind has dropped its voice and whispers instead of screaming, and the sun is out and the trees look surprised, and over everything there is the faintest, palest tint of green; weather entertains me.

“I'm trying my hand at shoplifting,” I told the salesgirl, and we both laughed.

I went to the biggest department store; I had not been there before, but one big department store is much like another. This one was one I might have been in a hundred times before; I knew where things were, and recognized the heavily scented air, so rich after the clean air outside. Sometimes I like big stores, with softness underfoot and pressing against the sides of your head; I like long counters with soft highlights and seductively tumbled scarves and vacant mannequins and the dirty gloves of shoppers; I like everything about big department stores except shopping in them. I do not like salesgirls and their manners, and having to buy my dresses in a special behemoths department, and I do not like the stupid mockery of people who enjoy keeping you waiting; I do not like credit offices, but I enjoy quarreling over a bill. Hughie used to be all lost, really frightened, when I got into a fight with a department store because I never really felt I was fighting with people, and so it was not necessary to observe any of the small delicate graces you use automatically when you are fighting with people; even with the electric company I always knew I was fighting with people, but never with department stores, and of course not with the telephone company. We paid our bills—I don't mean to sound as if I fought with any of them because I wanted to save money—but I could always enjoy a good fight over something. I loved being in a department store, and I am only surprised that I had not thought of shoplifting long before. “Shoplifting,” I explained to the salesgirl, and touched the little box gently with one finger, and we both laughed.

I had really no good idea how you went about stealing something from a department store, but I thought I could make it up as I went along; that is, you will observe, my way with almost everything. I have always been quite successful at making things up as I went along, and very often surprised at where I led myself. I never thought along the way that I might end up in jail, or hurt, or even embarrassed, because that is simply not the kind of thing that happens to the kind of person I am; I am not above the law, but somehow I make the law, which so many other people do not. This is not arrogance; I first became aware of this when I was a child and always got everything I wanted. Before God, I thought I wanted Hughie. But this is not shoplifting.

For reasons which amused me considerably, and which I do not care to discuss here, I had decided that what I most wanted to steal was an ornamental candle. I knew that there would probably be a department which sold candles and candlesticks and elaborate boxes of matches, and I thought to steal a candle and take it back to Mrs. Faun to put in the center of her appalling mantelpiece. Moreover, a candle is not too valuable, although perhaps not always easy to hide. Poor Hughie, and he was such a lousy painter.

In any case, I stepped onto the escalator—such a sense of power, such a sense of being carried, of permitting this small service underfoot—and, looking down at the store, let myself be taken to the second floor, where I paused briefly at lingerie; I do like lace; and then on to the third floor and the fourth, where I found a gift shop and, just beyond, the candles I was looking for. Perhaps a black candle for Mrs. Faun's next black mass, perhaps a candle that told time—although I do think that's too much of a good thing; the nicest part of a candle is its inaccuracy—or perhaps a candle topped with flowers, or a candle looking like a cabbage, or a house, or a poodle. I like things made to look like something else, although I draw the line at food. I once had a recipe for imitation potato pancakes made out of ground cauliflower, and they were just as vile as they sound. But an ordinary everyday plain camouflage is quite all right with me.

I saw a candle made of a thousand different colors, and it was very lovely; I quite wanted it. But wanting it and stealing it were two different things; if I started stealing just because I wanted a colored candle the whole point would be lost, and I had already decided that I could not buy it. So, reluctantly, I passed by the lovely candle and found quite a hideous one; it looked rather like Mrs. Faun, I thought, and I put it in my pocket. Then I turned and saw the salesgirl looking at me with an air of complete joy; she had seen me, of course, and she took a step forward and said, “Can I help you?” and waited to see what I would do.

Naturally, I took the candle out of my pocket and said, “No, just trying my hand at shoplifting,” and we both laughed. I set the candle back on the counter and turned away, my candle-stealing days over forever. She could have cried, that salesgirl; perhaps she had been waiting all her working life to catch a shoplifter in action; perhaps her big moment tonight at dinner was now hopelessly ruined. After all, “I caught a shoplifter today,” is a much more sensational beginning to a story than just a “I had the craziest old lady in my department today.” She must have waited on a good many crazy old ladies, and, understand, I'm not saying I'm old. She just looked like she'd tell it that way. So I had to shoplift something else. I won't go into the number of things I took and had to put back; I don't seem really cut out for the most efficient stealing; but I did manage to pick up a box of birth announcements (“I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl”) which I though might suit Mrs. Faun. No one seemed to care about those. One of the things I had to put back was a bottle of perfume called Svelte, which was fair anyway since I really wanted that.

Well, I'm not boasting. Some of the things that come to me work out well, and some do not. The seance was pretty good, but I will be the very first to admit that I am not light-fingered.





The Man in the Woods


Wearily, moving his feet because he had nothing else to do, Christopher went on down the road, hating the trees that moved slowly against his progress, hating the dust beneath his feet, hating the sky, hating this road, all roads, everywhere. He had been walking since morning, and all day the day before that, and the day before that, and days before that, back into the numberless line of walking days that dissolved, seemingly years ago, into the place he had left, once, before he started walking. This morning he had been walking past fields, and now he was walking past trees that mounted heavily to the road, and leaned across, bending their great old bodies toward him; Christopher had come into the forest at a crossroads, turning onto the forest road as though he had a choice, looking back once to see the other road, the one he had not chosen, going peacefully on through fields, in and out of towns, perhaps even coming to an end somewhere beyond Christopher's sight.

The cat had joined him shortly after he entered the forest, emerging from between the trees in a quick, shadowy movement that surprised Christopher at first and then, oddly, comforted him, and the cat had stayed beside him, moving closer to Christopher as the trees pressed insistently closer to them both, trotting along in the casual acceptance of human company that cats exhibit when they are frightened. Christopher, when he stopped once to rest, sitting on a large stone at the edge of the road, had rubbed the cat's ears and pulled the cat's tail affectionately, and had said, “Where we going, fellow? Any ideas?” and the cat had closed his eyes meaningfully and opened them again.

“Haven't seen a house since we came into these trees,” Christopher remarked once, later, to the cat; squinting up at the sky, he had added, “Going to be dark before long.” He glanced apprehensively at the trees so close to him, irritated by the sound of his own voice in the silence, as though the trees were listening to him and, listening, had nodded solemnly to one another.

“Don't worry,” Christopher said to the cat. “Road's got to go somewhere.”




It was not much later—an hour before dark, probably—that Christopher and the cat paused, surprised, at a turn in the road, because a house was ahead. A neat stone fence ran down to the road, smoke came naturally from the chimneys, the doors and windows were not nailed shut, nor were the steps broken or the hinges sagging. It was a comfortable-looking, settled old house, made of stone like its fence, easily found in the pathless forest because it lay correctly, compactly, at the end of the road, which was not a road at all, of course, but merely a way to the house. Christopher thought briefly of the other way, long before, that he had not followed, and then moved forward, the cat at his heels, to the front door of the house.

The sound of a river came from among the trees. The river knew a way out of the forest, because it moved along sweetly and clearly, over clean stones and, unafraid, among the dark trees.

Christopher approached the house as he would any house, farmhouse, suburban home, or city apartment, and knocked politely and with pleasure on the warm front door.

“Come in, then,” a woman said as she opened it, and Christopher stepped inside, followed closely by the cat.

The woman stood back and looked for a minute at Christopher, her eyes searching and wide; he looked back at her and saw that she was young, not so young as he would have liked, but too young, seemingly, to be living in the heart of a forest.

“I've been here for a long time, though,” she said, as if she'd read his thoughts. Out of this dark hallway, he thought, she might look older; her hair curled a little around her face, and her eyes were far too wide for the rest of her, as if she were constantly straining to see in the gloom of the forest. She wore a long green dress that was gathered at her waist by a belt made of what he subsequently saw was grass woven into a rope; she was barefoot. While he stood uneasily just inside the door, looking at her as she looked at him, the cat went round the hall, stopping curiously at corners and before closed doors, glancing up, once, into the unlighted heights of the stairway that rose from the far end of the hall.

“He smells another cat,” she said. “We have one.”

“Phyllis,” a voice called from the back of the house, and the woman smiled quickly, nervously, at Christopher and said, “Come along, please. I shouldn't keep you waiting.”

He followed her to the door at the back of the hall, next to the stairway, and was grateful for the light that greeted them when she opened it. He was led directly into a great warm kitchen, glowing with an open fire on its hearth, and well lit, against the late-afternoon dimness of the forest, by three kerosene lamps set on table and shelves. A second woman stood by the stove, watching the pots that steamed and smelled maddeningly of onions and herbs; Christopher closed his eyes, like the cat, against the unbelievable beauty of warmth, light, and the smell of onions.

“Well,” the woman at the stove said with finality, turning to look at Christopher. She studied him carefully, as the other woman had done, and then turned her eyes to a bare whitewashed area, high on the kitchen wall, where lines and crosses indicated a rough measuring system. “Another day,” she said.

“What's your name?” the first woman asked Christopher, and he said “Christopher” without effort and then, “What's yours?”

“Phyllis,” the young woman said. “What's your cat's name?”

“I don't know,” Christopher said. He smiled a little. “It's not even my cat,” he went on, his voice gathering strength from the smell of the onions. “He just followed me here.”

“We'll have to name him something,” Phyllis said. When she spoke she looked away from Christopher, turning her overlarge eyes on him again only when she stopped speaking. “Our cat's named Grimalkin.”

“Grimalkin,” Christopher said.

“Her name,” Phyllis said, gesturing with her head toward the cook. “Her name's Aunt Cissy.”

“Circe,” the older woman said doggedly to the stove. “Circe I was born and Circe I will have for my name till I die.”

Although she seemed, from the way she stood and the way she kept her voice to a single note, to be much older than Phyllis, Christopher saw her face clearly in the light of the lamps—she was vigorous and clear-eyed, and the strength in her arms when she lifted the great iron pot easily off the stove and carried it to the stone table in the center of the kitchen surprised Christopher. The cat, who had followed Christopher and Phyllis into the kitchen, leaped noiselessly onto the bench beside the table, and then onto the table; Phyllis looked warily at Christopher for a minute before she pushed the cat gently to drive him off the table.

“We'll have to find a name for your cat,” she said apologetically as the cat leaped down without taking offense.

“Kitty,” Christopher said helplessly. “I guess I always call cats ‘Kitty’.”

Phyllis shook her head. She was about to speak when Aunt Cissy stopped her with a glance, and Phyllis moved quickly to an iron chest in the corner of the kitchen, from which she took a cloth to spread on the table, and heavy stone plates and mugs, which she set on the table in four places. Christopher sat down on the bench, with his back to the table, to indicate clearly that he had no intention of presuming that he was sitting at the table but was on the bench only because he was tired, that he would not swing around to the table until invited warmly and specifically to do so.

“Are we almost ready, then?” Aunt Cissy said. She swept her eyes across the table, adjusted a fork, and stood back, her glance never for a minute resting on Christopher. Then she moved over to the wall beside the door, where she stood, quiet and erect, and Phyllis went to stand beside her. Christopher, turning his head to look at them, had to turn again as footsteps approached from the hall, and after a minute's interminable pause, the door opened. The two women stayed respectfully by the far wall, and Christopher stood up without knowing why, except that it was his host who was entering.




This was a man toward the end of middle age; although he held his shoulders stiffly back, they looked as if they would sag without a constant effort. His face was lined and tired, and his mouth, like his shoulders, appeared to be falling downward into resignation. He was dressed, as the women were, in a long green robe tied at the waist, and he, too, was barefoot. As he stood in the doorway, with the darkness of the hall behind him, his white head shone softly, and his eyes, bright and curious, regarded Christopher for a long minute before they turned, as the older woman's had done, to the crude measuring system on the upper wall.

“We are honored to have you here,” he said at last to Christopher; his voice was resonant, like the sound of the wind in the trees. Without speaking again, he took his seat at the head of the stone table and gestured to Christopher to take the place on his right. Phyllis came away from her post by the door and slipped into the place across from Christopher, and Aunt Cissy served them all from the iron pot before taking her own place at the foot of the table.

Christopher stared down at the plate before him, and the rich smell of the onions and meat met him, so that he closed his eyes again for a minute before starting to eat. When he lifted his head he could see, over Phyllis's head, the dark window, the trees pressed so close against it that their branches were bent against the glass, a tangled crowd of leaves and branches looking in.

“What will we call you?” the old man asked Christopher at last.

“I'm Christopher,” Christopher said, looking only at his plate or up at the window.

“And have you come far?” the old man said.

“Very far.” Christopher smiled. “I suppose it seems farther than it really is,” he explained.

“I am named Oakes,” the old man said.

Christopher gathered himself together with an effort. Ever since entering this strange house he had been bewildered, as though intoxicated from his endless journey through the trees, and uneasy at coming from darkness and the watching forest into a house where he sat down without introductions at his host's table. Swallowing, Christopher turned to look at Mr. Oakes and said, “It's very kind of you to take me in. If you hadn't, I guess I'd have been wandering around in the woods all night.”

Mr. Oakes bowed his head slightly at Christopher.

“I guess I was a little frightened,” Christopher said with a small embarrassed laugh. “All those trees.”

“Indeed yes,” Mr. Oakes said placidly. “All those trees.”

Christopher wondered if he had shown his gratitude adequately. He wanted very much to say something further, something that might lead to an explicit definition of his privileges: whether he was to stay the night, for instance, or whether he must go out again into the woods in the darkness; whether, if he did stay the night, he might have in the morning another such meal as this dinner. When Aunt Cissy filled his plate a second time, Christopher smiled up at her. “This is certainly wonderful,” he said to her. “I don't know when I've had a meal I enjoyed this much.”

Aunt Cissy bowed her head to him as Mr. Oakes had before.

“The food comes from the woods, of course,” Mr. Oakes said. “Circe gathers her onions down by the river, but naturally none of that need concern you.”

“I suppose not,” Christopher said, feeling that he was not to stay the night.

“Tomorrow will be soon enough for you to see the house,” Mr. Oakes added.

“I suppose so,” Christopher said, realizing that he was indeed to stay the night.

“Tonight,” Mr. Oakes said, his voice deliberately light. “Tonight, I should like to hear about you, and what things you have seen on your journey, and what takes place in the world you have left.”

Christopher smiled. Knowing that he could stay the night, could not in charity be dismissed before the morning, he felt relaxed. Aunt Cissy's good dinner had pleased him, and he was ready enough to talk with his host.

“I don't really know quite how I got here,” he said. “I just took the road into the woods.”

“You would have to go through the woods to get here,” his host agreed soberly.

“Before that,” Christopher went on, “I passed a lot of farmhouses and a little town—do you know the name of it? I asked a woman there for a meal and she turned me away.”

He laughed now, at the memory, with Aunt Cissy's good dinner warm inside him.

“And before that,” he said, “I was studying.”

“You are a scholar,” the old man said. “Naturally.”

“I don't know why.” Christopher turned at last to Mr. Oakes and spoke frankly. “I don't know why,” he repeated. “One day I was there, in college, like everyone else, and then the next day I just left, without any reason except that I did.” He glanced from Mr. Oakes to Phyllis to Aunt Cissy; they were all looking at him with blank expectation. He stopped, then said lamely, “And I guess that's all that happened before I came here.”

“He brought a cat with him,” Phyllis said softly, her eyes down.

“A cat?” Mr. Oakes looked politely around the kitchen, saw Christopher's cat curled up under the stove, and nodded. “One brought a dog,” he said to Aunt Cissy. “Do you remember the dog?”

Aunt Cissy nodded, her face unchanging.

There was a sound at the door, and Phyllis said, without moving, “That is our Grimalkin coming for his supper.”

Aunt Cissy rose and went over to the outer door and opened it. A cat, tiger-striped where Christopher's cat was black, but about the same size, trotted casually into the kitchen, without a glance at Aunt Cissy, went directly for the stove, then saw Christopher's cat. Christopher's cat lifted his head lazily, widened his eyes, and stared at Grimalkin.

“I think they're going to fight,” Christopher said nervously, half rising from his seat. “Perhaps I'd better—”

But he was too late. Grimalkin lifted his voice in a deadly wail, and Christopher's cat spat, without stirring from his comfortable bed under the stove; then Grimalkin moved incautiously and was caught off guard by Christopher's cat. Spitting and screaming, they clung to each other briefly, then Grimalkin ran crying out the door that Aunt Cissy opened for him.

Mr. Oakes sighed. “What is your cat's name?” he inquired.

“I'm terribly sorry,” Christopher said, with a fleeting fear that his irrational cat might have deprived them both of a bed. “Shall I go and find Grimalkin outside?”

Mr. Oakes laughed. “He was fairly beaten,” he said, “and has no right to come back.”

“Now,” Phyllis said softly, “now we can call your cat Grimalkin. Now we have a name, Grimalkin, and no cat, so we can give the name to your cat.”




Christopher slept that night in a stone room at the top of the house, a room reached by the dark staircase leading from the hall. Mr. Oakes carried a candle to the room for him, and Christopher's cat, now named Grimalkin, left the warm stove to follow. The room was small and neat, and the bed was a stone bench, which Christopher, investigating after his host had gone, discovered to his amazement was mattressed with leaves, and had for blankets heavy furs that looked like bearskins.

“This is quite a forest,” Christopher said to the cat, rubbing a corner of the bearskin between his hands. “And quite a family.”

Against the window of Christopher's room, as against all the windows in the house, was the wall of trees, crushing themselves hard against the glass. “I wonder if that's why they made this house out of stone?” Christopher asked the cat. “So the trees wouldn't push it down?”

All night long the sound of the trees came into Christopher's dreams, and he turned gratefully in his sleep to the cat purring beside him in the great fur coverings.




In the morning, Christopher came down into the kitchen, where Phyllis and Aunt Cissy, in their green robes, were moving about the stove. His cat, who had followed him down the stairs, moved immediately ahead of him in the kitchen to sit under the stove and watch Aunt Cissy expectantly. When Phyllis had set the stone table and Aunt Cissy had laid out the food, they both moved over to the doorway as they had the night before, waiting for Mr. Oakes to come in.

When he came, he nodded to Christopher and they sat, as before, Aunt Cissy serving them all. Mr. Oakes did not speak this morning, and when the meal was over he rose, gesturing to Christopher to follow him. They went out into the hall, with its silent closed doors, and Mr. Oakes paused.

“You have seen only part of the house, of course,” he said. “Our handmaidens keep to the kitchen unless called to this hall.”

“Where do they sleep?” Christopher asked. “In the kitchen?” He was immediately embarrassed by his own question, and smiled awkwardly at Mr. Oakes to say that he did not deserve an answer, but Mr. Oakes shook his head in amusement and put his hand on Christopher's shoulder.

“On the kitchen floor,” he said. And then he turned his head away, but Christopher could see that he was laughing. “Circe,” he said, “sleeps nearer to the door from the hall.”

Christopher felt his face growing red and, glad for the darkness of the hall, said quickly, “It's a very old house, isn't it?”

“Very old,” Mr. Oakes said, as though surprised by the question. “A house was found to be vital, of course.”

“Of course,” Christopher said, agreeably.

“In here,” Mr. Oakes said, opening one of the two great doors on either side of the entrance. “In here are the records kept.”

Christopher followed him in, and Mr. Oakes went to a candle that stood in its own wax on a stone table and lit it with the flint that lay beside it. He then raised the candle high, and Christopher saw that the walls were covered with stones, piled up to make loose, irregular shelves. On some of the shelves great, leather-covered books stood, and on other shelves lay stone tablets, and rolls of parchment.

“They are of great value,” Mr. Oakes said sadly. “I have never known how to use them, of course.” He walked slowly over and touched one huge volume, then turned to show Christopher his fingers covered with dust. “It is my sorrow,” he said, “that I cannot use these things of great value.”

Christopher, frightened by the books, drew back into the doorway. “At one time,” Mr. Oakes said, shaking his head, “there were many more. Many, many more. I have heard that at one time this room was made large enough to hold the records. I have never known how they came to be destroyed.”

Still carrying the candle, he led Christopher out of the room and shut the big door behind them. Across the hall another door faced them. As Mr. Oakes led the way in with the candle, Christopher saw that it was another bedroom, larger than the one in which he had slept.

“This, of course,” Mr. Oakes said, “is where I have been sleeping, to guard the records.”

He held the candle high again and Christopher saw a stone bench like his own, with heavy furs lying on it, and above the bed a long and glittering knife resting upon two pegs driven between the stones of the wall.

“The keeper of the records,” Mr. Oakes said, and sighed briefly before he smiled at Christopher in the candlelight. “We are like two friends,” he added. “One showing the other his house.”

“But—” Christopher began, and Mr. Oakes laughed.

“Let me show you my roses,” he said.

Christopher followed him helplessly back into the hall, where Mr. Oakes blew out the candle and left it on a shelf by the door, and then out the front door to the tiny cleared patch before the house, which was surrounded by the stone wall that ran to the road. Although for a small distance before them the world was clear of trees, it was not very much lighter or more pleasant, with the forest only barely held back by the stone wall, edging as close to it as possible, pushing, as Christopher had felt since the day before, crowding up and embracing the little stone house in horrid possession.

“Here are my roses,” Mr. Oakes said, his voice warm. He looked calculatingly beyond at the forest as he spoke, his eyes measuring the distance between the trees and his roses. “I planted them myself,” he said. “I was the first one to clear away even this much of the forest. Because I wished to plant roses in the midst of this wilderness. Even so,” he added, “I had to send Circe for roses from the midst of this beast around us, to set them here in my little clear spot.” He leaned affectionately over the roses, which grew gloriously against the stone of the house, on a vine that rose triumphantly almost to the height of the door. Over him, over the roses, over the house, the trees leaned eagerly.

“They need to be tied up against stakes every spring,” Mr. Oakes said. He stepped back a pace and measured with his hand above his head. “A stake—a small tree stripped of its branches will do, and Circe will get it and sharpen it—and the rose vine tied to it as it leans against the house.”

Christopher nodded. “Someday the roses will cover the house, I imagine,” he said.

“Do you think so?” Mr. Oakes turned eagerly to him. “My roses?”

“It looks like it,” Christopher said awkwardly, his fingers touching the first stake, bright against the stones of the house.

Mr. Oakes shook his head, smiling. “Remember who planted them,” he said.




They went inside again and through the hall into the kitchen, where Aunt Cissy and Phyllis stood against the wall as they entered. Again they sat at the stone table and Aunt Cissy served them, and again Mr. Oakes said nothing while they ate and Phyllis and Aunt Cissy looked down at their plates.

After the meal was over, Mr. Oakes bowed to Christopher before leaving the room, and while Phyllis and Aunt Cissy cleared the table of plates and cloth Christopher sat on the bench with his cat on his knee. The women seemed to be unusually occupied. Aunt Cissy, at the stove, set down iron pots enough for a dozen meals, and Phyllis, sent to fetch a special utensil from an alcove in the corner of the kitchen, came back to report that it had been mislaid “since the last time” and could not be found, so that Aunt Cissy had to put down her cooking spoon and go herself to search.

Phyllis set a great pastry shell on the stone table, and she and Aunt Cissy filled it slowly and lovingly with spoonfuls from one or another pot on the stove, stopping to taste and estimate, questioning each other with their eyes.

“What are you making?” Christopher asked finally.

“A feast,” Phyllis said, glancing at him quickly and then away.

Christopher's cat watched, purring, until Aunt Cissy disappeared into the kitchen alcove again and came back carrying the trussed carcass of what seemed to Christopher to be a wild pig. She and Phyllis set this on the spit before the great fireplace, and Phyllis sat beside it to turn the spit. Then Christopher's cat leaped down and ran over to the fireplace to sit beside Phyllis and taste the drops of fat that fell on the great hearth as the spit was turned.

“Who is coming to your feast?” Christopher asked, amused.

Phyllis looked around at him, and Aunt Cissy half turned from the stove. There was a silence in the kitchen, a silence of no movement and almost no breath, and then, before anyone could speak, the door opened and Mr. Oakes came in. He was carrying the knife from his bedroom, and with a shrug of resignation he held it out for Christopher to see. When Mr. Oakes had seated himself at the table, Aunt Cissy disappeared again into the alcove and brought back a grindstone, which she set before Mr. Oakes. Deliberately, with the slow caution of a pleasant action lovingly done, Mr. Oakes set about sharpening the knife. He held the bright blade against the moving stone, turning the edge little by little with infinite delicacy.

“You say you've come far?” he said over the sound of the knife, and for a minute his eyes left the grindstone to rest on Christopher.

“Quite a ways,” Christopher said, watching the grindstone. “I don't know how far, exactly.”

“And you were a scholar?”

“Yes,” Christopher said. “A student.”

Mr. Oakes looked up from the knife again, to the estimate marked on the wall.

“Christopher,” he said softly, as though estimating the name.

When the knife was razor sharp, Mr. Oakes held it up to the light from the fire, studying the blade. Then he looked at Christopher and shook his head humorously. “As sharp as any weapon can be,” he said.

Aunt Cissy spoke, unsolicited, for the first time. “Sun's down,” she said.

Mr. Oakes nodded. He looked at Phyllis for a minute, and at Aunt Cissy. Then, with his sharpened knife in his hand, he walked over and put his free arm around Christopher's shoulder. “Will you remember about the roses?” he asked. “They must be tied up in the spring if they mean to grow at all.”

For a minute his arm stayed warmly around Christopher's shoulders, and then, carrying his knife, he went over to the back door and waited while Aunt Cissy came to open it for him. As the door was opened, the trees showed for a minute, dark and greedy. Then Aunt Cissy closed the door behind Mr. Oakes. For a minute she leaned her back against it, watching Christopher, then, standing away from it, she opened it again. Christopher, staring, walked slowly over to the open door, as Aunt Cissy seemed to expect he would, and heard behind him Phyllis's voice from the hearth.

“He'll be down by the river,” she said softly. “Go far around and come up behind him.”

The door shut solidly behind Christopher and he leaned against it, looking with frightened eyes at the trees that reached for him on either side. Then, as he pressed his back in terror against the door, he heard the voice calling from the direction of the river, so clear and ringing through the trees that he hardly knew it as Mr. Oakes's: “Who is he dares enter these my woods?”





Paranoia


Mr. Halloran Beresford, pleasantly tired after a good day in the office, still almost clean-shaven after eight hours, his pants still neatly pressed, pleased with himself particularly for remembering, stepped out of the candy shop with a great box under his arm and started briskly for the corner. There were twenty small-size gray suits like Mr. Beresford's on every New York block, fifty men still clean-shaven and pressed after a day in an air-cooled office, a hundred small men, perhaps, pleased with themselves for remembering their wives' birthdays. Mr. Beresford was going to take his wife out to dinner, he decided, going to see if he could get last-minute tickets to a show, taking his wife candy. It had been an exceptionally good day, altogether, and Mr. Beresford walked along swiftly, humming musically to himself.

He stopped on the corner, wondering whether he would save more time by taking a bus or by trying to catch a taxi in the crowd. It was a long trip downtown, and Mr. Beresford ordinarily enjoyed the quiet half hour on top of a Fifth Avenue bus, perhaps reading his paper. He disliked the subway intensely, and found the public display and violent exercise necessary to catch a taxi usually more than he was equal to. However, tonight he had spent a lot of time waiting in line in the candy store to get his wife's favorite chocolates, and if he was going to get home before dinner was on the table he really had to hurry a little.

Mr. Beresford went a few steps into the street, waved at a taxi, said “Taxi!” in a voice that went helplessly into a falsetto, and slunk back, abashed, to the sidewalk while the taxi went by uncomprehending. A man in a light hat stopped next to Mr. Beresford on the sidewalk, and for a minute, in the middle of the crowd, he stared at Mr. Beresford and Mr. Beresford stared at him as people sometimes do without caring particularly what they see. What Mr. Beresford saw was a thin face under the light hat, a small mustache, a coat collar turned up. Funny-looking guy, Mr. Beresford thought, lightly touching his own clean-shaven lip. Perhaps the man thought Mr. Beresford's almost unconscious gesture was offensive; at any rate he frowned and looked Mr. Beresford up and down before he turned away. Ugly customer, Mr. Beresford thought.

The Fifth Avenue bus Mr. Beresford usually took came slipping up to the corner, and Mr. Beresford, pleased not to worry about a taxi, started for the stop. He had reached out his hand to take the rail inside the bus door when he was roughly elbowed aside and the ugly customer in the light hat shoved on ahead of him. Mr. Beresford muttered and started to follow, but the bus door closed on the packed crowd inside, and the last thing Mr. Beresford saw as the bus went off down the street was the man in the light hat grinning at him from inside the door.

“There's a dirty trick,” Mr. Beresford told himself, settling his shoulders irritably in his coat. Still under the influence of his annoyance, he ran a few steps out into the street and waved again at a taxi, not trusting his voice, and was almost run down by a delivery truck. As Mr. Beresford skidded back to the sidewalk the truck driver leaned out and yelled something unrecognizable at Mr. Beresford, and when Mr. Beresford saw the people around him on the corner laughing he decided to start walking downtown; in two blocks he would reach another bus stop, a good corner for taxis, and a subway station; much as Mr. Beresford disliked the subway, he might still have to take it, to get home in any sort of time. Walking downtown, his candy box under his arm, his gray suit almost unaffected by the crush on the corner, Mr. Beresford decided to swallow his annoyance and remember that it was his wife's birthday; he began to hum again as he walked.




He watched the people as he walked along, his perspective sharpened by being a man who had just succeeded in forgetting an annoyance; surely the girl in the very high-heeled shoes, coming toward him with a frown on her face, was not so able to put herself above petty trifles, or maybe she was frowning because of the shoes; the old lady and man looking at the shop windows were quarreling. The funny-looking guy in the light hat coming quickly through the crowd looked as though he hated someone... the funny-looking guy in the light hat; Mr. Beresford turned clean around in the walking line of people and watched the man in the light hat turn abruptly and start walking downtown, about ten feet in back of Mr. Beresford. What do you know about that? Mr. Beresford marveled, and began to walk a little more quickly. Probably got off the bus for some reason; wrong bus, maybe. Then why would he start walking uptown instead of catching another bus where he was? Mr. Beresford shrugged and passed two girls walking together and talking both at once.

Halfway from the corner he wanted, Mr. Beresford realized with a sort of sick shock that the man in the light hat was at his elbow, walking steadily along next to him. Mr. Beresford turned his head the other way and slowed his step. The other man slowed down as well, without looking at Mr. Beresford.

Nonsense, Mr. Beresford thought, without troubling to work it out any further than that. He settled his candy box firmly under his arm and cut abruptly across the uptown line of people and into a shop; a souvenir and notions shop, he realized as he came through the door. There were a few people inside—a woman and a little girl, a sailor—and Mr. Beresford retired to the far end of the counter and began to fuss with an elaborate cigarette box on which was written SOUVENIR OF NEW YORK CITY, with the Trylon and the perisphere painted beneath.

“Isn't this cute?” the mother said to the little girl, and they both began to laugh enormously over the match holder made in the form of a toilet; the matches were to go in the bowl, and on the cover, Mr. Beresford could see, were the Trylon and the perisphere, with SOUVENIR OF NEW YORK CITY written above.

The man in the light hat came into the shop, and Mr. Beresford turned his back and busied himself picking up one thing after another from the counter; with half his mind he was trying to find something that did not say SOUVENIR OF NEW YORK CITY and with the other half of his mind he was wondering about the man in the light hat. The question of what the man in the light hat wanted was immediately subordinate to the question of whom he wanted; if his light-hatted designs were against Mr. Beresford they must be nefarious, else why had he not announced them before now? The thought of accosting the man and demanding his purpose crossed Mr. Beresford's mind fleetingly, and was succeeded, as always in an equivocal situation, by Mr. Beresford's vivid recollection of his own small size and innate cautiousness. Best, Mr. Beresford decided, to avoid this man. Thinking this, Mr. Beresford walked steadily toward the doorway of the shop, intending to pass the man in the light hat and go out and catch his bus home.

He had not quite reached the man in the light hat when the shop's clerk came around the end of the counter and met Mr. Beresford with a genial smile and a vehement “See anything you like, mister?”

“Not tonight, thanks,” Mr. Beresford said, moving left to avoid the clerk, but the clerk moved likewise and said, “Got some nice things you didn't look at.”

“No, thanks,” Mr. Beresford said, trying to make his tenor voice firm.

“Take a look,” the clerk insisted. This was unusually persistent even for such a clerk; Mr. Beresford looked up and saw the man in the light hat on his right, bearing down on him. Over the shoulders of the two men he could see that the shop was empty. The street looked very far away, the people passing in either direction looked smaller and smaller; Mr. Beresford realized that he was being forced to step backward as the two men advanced on him.

“Easy does it,” the man in the light hat said to the clerk. They continued to move forward slowly.

“See here now,” Mr. Beresford said, with the ineffectuality of the ordinary man caught in such a crisis; he still clutched his box of candy under his arm. “See here,” he said, feeling the solid weight of the wall behind him.

“Ready,” the man in the light hat said. The two men tensed, and Mr. Beresford, with a wild yell, broke between them and ran for the door. He heard a sound more like a snarl than anything else behind him and the feet coming after him. I'm safe on the street, Mr. Beresford thought as he went through the door into the line of people; as long as there are lots of people, they can't do anything to me. He looked back, walking downtown between a fat woman with many packages and a girl and a boy leaning on each other's shoulders, and he saw the clerk standing in the doorway of the shop looking after him; the man in the light hat was not in sight. Mr. Beresford shifted the box of candy so that his right arm was free, and thought, Perfectly silly. It's still broad daylight. How they ever hoped to get away with it ....

The man in the light hat was on the corner ahead, waiting. Mr. Beresford hesitated in his walk and then thought, It's preposterous, all these people watching. He walked boldly down the street; the man in the light hat was not even watching him, but was leaning calmly against a building lighting a cigarette. Mr. Beresford reached the corner, darted quickly into the street, and yelled boisterously “Taxi!” in a great voice he had never suspected he possessed until now. A taxi stopped as though not daring to disregard that great shout, and Mr. Beresford moved gratefully toward it. His hand was on the door handle when another hand closed over his, and Mr. Beresford was aware of the light hat brushing his cheek.

“Come on if you're coming,” the taxi driver said; the door was open, and Mr. Beresford, resisting the push that urged him into the taxi, slipped his hand out from under the other hand and ran back to the sidewalk. A crosstown bus had stopped on the corner, and Mr. Beresford, no longer thinking, hurried onto it, dropped a nickel into the coin register, and went to the back of the bus and sat down. The man in the light hat sat a little ahead, between Mr. Beresford and the door. Mr. Beresford put his box of candy on his lap and tried to think. Obviously the man in the light hat was not carrying a grudge all this time about Mr. Beresford's almost unconscious gesture toward his mustache, unless he was peculiarly sensitive. In any case, there was also the clerk in the souvenir shop; Mr. Beresford realized suddenly that the clerk in the souvenir shop was a very odd circumstance indeed. Mr. Beresford set the clerk aside to think about later and went back to the man in the light hat. If it was not the insult to the mustache, what was it? And then another thought caught Mr. Beresford breathless: How long, then, had the man in the light hat been following him? He thought back along the day: He had left his office with a group of people, all talking cheerfully, all reminding Mr. Beresford that it was his wife's birthday; they had escorted Mr. Beresford to the candy shop and left him there. He had been in his office all day except for lunch with three fellows in the office; Mr. Beresford's mind leaped suddenly from the lunch to his first sight of the man in the light hat at the bus stop; it seemed that the man in the light hat had been trying to push him onto the bus and into the crowd, instead of pushing in ahead. In that case, once he was on the bus... Mr. Beresford looked around. In the bus he was riding on now there were only five people left. One was the driver, one Mr. Beresford, one the man in the light hat, sitting slightly ahead of Mr. Beresford. The two others were an old lady with a shopping bag and a man who looked as though he might be a foreigner. Foreigner, Mr. Beresford thought, while he looked at the man, Foreigner, foreign plot, spies. Better not rely on any foreigner, Mr. Beresford thought.

The bus was going swiftly along between high dark buildings. Mr. Beresford, looking out the window, decided that they were in a factory district, remembered that they had been going east, and decided to wait until they got to one of the lighted, busy sections before he tried to get off. Peering off into the growing darkness, Mr. Beresford noticed an odd thing. There had been someone standing on the corner beside a sign saying BUS STOP and the bus had not stopped, even though the dim figure waved its arms. Surprised, Mr. Beresford glanced up at the street sign, noticing that it said E. 31 ST. at the same moment he reached for the cord to signal the driver that he wanted to get off. As he stood up and went down the aisle, the foreign-looking man rose also and went to the door beside the driver. “Getting off,” the foreign man said, and the bus slowed. Mr. Beresford pressed forward, and somehow the old lady's shopping bag got in his way and spilled, sending small items, a set of blocks, a package of paper clips, spilling in all directions.

“Sorry,” Mr. Beresford said desperately as the bus doors opened. He began to move forward again, and the old lady caught his arm and said, “Don't bother if you're in a hurry. I can get them, dear.” Mr. Beresford tried to shake her off, and she said, “If this is your stop, don't worry. It's perfectly all right.”

A coil of pink ribbon was caught around Mr. Beresford's shoe; the old lady said, “It was clumsy of me, leaving my bag right in the aisle.”

As Mr. Beresford broke away from her, the doors closed and the bus started. Resigned, Mr. Beresford got down on one knee in the swaying bus and began to pick up paper clips, blocks, a box of letter paper that had opened and spilled sheets and envelopes all over the floor. “I'm so sorry,” the old lady said sweetly. “It was all my fault, too.”

Over his shoulder, Mr. Beresford saw the man in the light hat sitting comfortably. He was smoking, and his head was thrown back and his eyes were shut. Mr. Beresford gathered together the old lady's possessinos as well as he could, then made his way forward to stand by the driver. “Getting off,” Mr. Beresford said.

“Can't stop in the middle of the block,” the driver said, not turning his head.

“The next stop, then,” Mr. Beresford said.

The bus moved rapidly on. Mr. Beresford, bending down to see the streets out the front window, saw a sign saying BUS STOP.

“Here,” he said.

“What?” the driver said, going past.

“Listen,” Mr. Beresford said. “I want to get off.”

“It's okay with me,” the driver said. “Next stop.”

“You just passed one,” Mr. Beresford said.

“No one waiting there,” the driver said. “Anyway, you didn't tell me in time.” Mr. Beresford waited. After a minute he saw another bus stop and said, “Okay.”

The bus did not stop, but went past the sign without slowing down.

“Report me,” the driver said.

“Listen, now,” Mr. Beresford said, and the driver turned one eye up at him; he seemed to be amused.

“Report me,” the driver said. “My number's right here on this card.”

“If you don't stop at the next stop,” Mr. Beresford said, “I shall smash the glass in the door and shout for help.”

“What with?” the driver said. “The box of candy?”

“How do you know it's—” Mr. Beresford said before he realized that if he got into a conversation he would miss the next bus stop. It had not occurred to him that he could get off anywhere except at a bus stop; he saw lights ahead, and at the same time the bus slowed down and Mr. Beresford, looking quickly back, saw the man in the light hat stretch and get up.

The bus pulled to a stop in front of a bus sign; there was a group of stores.

“OKAY,” the bus driver said to Mr. Beresford, “you were so anxious to get off.” The man in the light hat got off at the rear door. Mr. Beresford, standing by the open front door, hesitated and said, “I guess I'll stay on for a while.”

“Last stop,” the bus driver said. “Everybody off.” He looked sardonically up at Mr. Beresford. “Report me if you want to,” he said. “My number's right on that card there.”

Mr. Beresford got off and went directly up to the man in the light hat, standing on the sidewalk. “This is perfectly ridiculous,” he said emphatically. “I don't understand any of it, and I want you to know that the first policeman I see—”

He stopped when he realized that the man in the light hat was looking not at him but, bored and fixedly, over his shoulder. Mr. Beresford turned and saw a policeman standing on the corner.

“Just you wait,” he said to the man in the light hat, and started for the policeman. Halfway to the policeman he began to wonder again: What did he have to report? A bus driver who would not stop when directed to, a clerk in a souvenir shop who cornered customers, a mysterious man in a light hat—and why? Mr. Beresford realized that there was nothing he could tell the policeman; he looked over his shoulder and saw the man in the light hat watching him, then Mr. Beresford bolted suddenly down a subway entrance. He had a nickel in his hand by the time he reached the bottom of the steps, and he went right through the turnstile; to the left was downtown, and he ran that way.

He was figuring as he ran: He'll think if I'm very stupid I'd head downtown, if I'm smarter than that I'd go uptown, if I'm really smart I'd go downtown. Does he think I'm middling smart or very smart?

The man in the light hat reached the downtown platform only a few seconds after Mr. Beresford and sauntered down the platform, his hands in his pockets. Mr. Beresford sat down on the bench listlessly. It's no good, he thought, no good at all; he knows just how smart I am.

The train came blasting into the station; Mr. Beresford ran into one car and saw the light hat disappear into the next car. Just as the doors were closing Mr. Beresford dived, caught the door, and would have been out except for a girl who seized his arm and shouted, “Harry! Where in God's name are you going?”

The door was held halfway open by Mr. Beresford's body, his arm left inside with the girl, who seemed to be holding it with all her strength. “Isn't this a fine thing,” she said to the people in the car, “He sure doesn't want to see his old friends.”

A few people laughed; most of them were watching.

“Hang on to him, sister,” someone said.

The girl laughed and tugged on Mr. Beresford's arm. “He's gonna get away,” she said laughingly to the people in the car, and a big man stepped up to her with a grin and said, “If you gotta have him that bad, we'll bring him in for you.”

Mr. Beresford felt the grasp on his arm turn suddenly into an irresistible force that drew him in through the doors, and they closed behind him. Everyone in the car was laughing at him by now, and the big man said, “That ain't no way to treat a lady, chum.”

Mr. Beresford looked around for the girl, but she had melted into the crowd somewhere and the train was moving. After a minute the people in the car stopped looking at him, and Mr. Beresford smoothed his coat and found that his box of candy was still intact.

The subway train was going downtown. Mr. Beresford, who was now racking his brains for detective tricks, for mystery-story dodges, thought of one that seemed foolproof. He stayed docilely on the train, as it went downtown, and got a seat at Twenty-third Street. At Fourteenth he got off, the light hat following, and went up the stairs and into the street. As he had expected, the large department store ahead of him advertised OPEN TILL 9 TONIGHT and the doors swung wide, back and forth, with people going constantly in and out. Mr. Beresford went in. The store bewildered him at first—counters stretching away in all directions, the lights much brighter than anywhere else, the voices clamoring. Mr. Beresford moved slowly along beside a counter; it was stockings first, thin and tan and black and gauzy, and then it was handbags, piles on sale, neat solitary ones in the cases, and then it was medical supplies, with huge almost human figures wearing obscene trusses, standing right there on the counter, and people coming embarrassedly to buy. Mr. Beresford turned the corner and came to a counter of odds and ends. Scarves too cheap to be at the scarf counter, postcards, a bin marked ANY ITEM 25¢, dark glasses. Uncomfortably, Mr. Beresford bought a pair of dark glasses and put them on.

He went out of the store at an entrance far away from the one he had used to come in; he could have chosen any of eight or nine entrances, but this seemed complicated enough. There was no sign of the light hat, no one tried to hinder Mr. Beresford as he stepped up to the taxi stand, and, although he debated taking the second or third car, he finally took the one in front and gave his home address.




He reached his apartment building without mishap, and stole cautiously out of the taxi and into the lobby. There was no light hat, no odd person watching for Mr. Beresford. In the elevator, alone, with no one to see which floor button he pressed, Mr. Beresford took a long breath and began to wonder if he had dreamed his wild trip home. He rang his apartment bell and waited; then his wife came to the door, and Mr. Beresford, suddenly tired out, went into his home.

“You're terribly late, darling,” his wife said affectionately, and then, “But what's the matter?”

He looked at her; she was wearing her blue dress, and that meant she knew it was her birthday and expected him to take her out; he handed her the box of candy limply and she took it, hardly noticing it in her anxiety over him. “What on earth has happened?” she asked. “Darling, come in here and sit down. You look terrible.”

He let her lead him into the living room, into his own chair where it was comfortable, and he lay back.

“Is there something wrong?” she was asking anxiously, fussing over him, loosening his tie, smoothing his hair. “Are you sick? Were you in an accident? What has happened?”

He realized that he seemed more tired than he really was, and was glorying in all this attention. He sighed deeply and said, “Nothing. Nothing wrong. Tell you in a minute.”

“Wait,” she said. “I'll get you a drink.”

He put his head back against the soft chair as she went out. Never knew that door had a key, his mind registered dimly as he heard it turn. Then he was on his feet with his head against the door listening to her at the telephone in the hall.

She dialled and waited. Then: “Listen,” she said, “listen, he came here after all. I've got him.”
