没有秘密的斯芬克斯[1]

——一幅蚀刻版画


一天下午，我正坐在和平咖啡馆外面，望着巴黎生活的光鲜与寒酸，一边喝着苦艾酒，一边对从我面前经过的这幅荣华与贫困交织的图景感到惊奇，这时我听到有人叫我的名字。我转过身，看到是默奇森勋爵。将近十年前，我们在一起上过大学。从那以来，我们没有见过面，所以我很高兴跟他再次相逢，我们热情握手。在牛津，我们曾经是要好的朋友。我当时非常喜欢他，他是那么潇洒漂亮、意气风发，那么值得尊敬。过去我们经常说，他要不是总说真话，就会是最出色的伙伴，但我觉得我们实际上格外佩服他的坦率。我发现他改变了好多。他一副焦虑困惑的样子，似乎对某件事儿疑神疑鬼。我觉得这不可能是现代的多疑癖，因为默奇森是最坚定的保守党人，对参议院的信仰就像对《摩西五经》[2]的信仰一样坚定。于是，我得出了结论，其原因在于一个女人，就问他结没结婚。

“我对女人还不够了解。”他答道。

“我亲爱的杰拉德，”我说，“女人是要被爱的，而不是要被了解的。”

“如果不能信任，我就没法去爱。”他答道。

“杰拉德，我相信你在生活中有一个秘密，”我大声说道，“告诉我是怎么回事。”

“我们坐车去兜风吧，”他回答说，“这里太挤了。不，不是黄车，其他任何颜色都可以——瞧，那辆深绿色的就行。”不一会儿，我们顺着林荫大道朝马德琳教堂方向一路驶去。

“我们要到哪里去？”我问。

“噢，你喜欢去哪里就去哪里！”他回答道，“去布洛涅森林[3]的餐厅。我们去那里吃饭，你要把自己所有的一切都告诉我。”

“我想先听听你的情况，”我说，“把你的秘密告诉我。”

他从口袋里掏出一只带有小银扣钩的摩洛哥羊皮盒子递给我。我打开盒子，里面有一张女人的照片。细高的身材，迷蒙的大眼，松散的头发，有一种奇异之美。她看上去仿佛有一双通灵般的眼睛，身上裹着昂贵的皮衣。

“你觉得那张脸怎么样？”他问，“它看上去坦诚吗？”

我仔细观察。在我看来，这是一个藏有秘密的人的脸，但那个秘密是好是坏，我却说不上来。它的美是一种由许多秘密塑造成的美——实际上，那种美是心理上的美，而不是造型上的美——嘴唇刚好浮起的淡淡微笑过于微妙，称不上真正的甜美。

“好吧，”他不耐烦地嚷道，“你以为如何？”

“她是身穿黑貂皮的乔孔达[4]，”我回答说，“告诉我有关她的所有情况。”

“不是现在，”他说，“晚饭后吧。”随后他就开始谈论其他事情。

当侍者给我们送来了咖啡和香烟的时候，我提醒杰拉德记住自己的诺言。他从座位上站起身，在房间里走了两三个来回，然后一屁股坐进扶手椅，给我讲了下面的故事：

“一天傍晚，”他说，“五点钟左右，我正沿着邦德街散步。当时，马车堵得要死，交通几乎瘫痪。靠近人行道停着一辆黄色小马车。出于这样或那样的原因，它吸引了我的注意。当我经过那里的时候，那张脸正从里往外看，就是今天下午我让你看的那张脸。它立刻就迷住了我。整个晚上，还有第二天整整一天，我都在不停地想着它。我徘徊在那条拥挤不堪的街上，窥视着每一辆马车，等待着那辆黄色马车。可是，我找不到我的陌生美人[5]。最后，我渐渐地觉得她只是一场梦。大约一个星期后，我要跟德·拉斯提尔夫人共进晚餐。晚餐定于八点钟。但到了八点半，我们还在客厅里等待着。最后，仆人猛地打开了门，宣布阿尔罗伊夫人驾到。这就是我一直在寻找的那个女人。她慢悠悠地走了进来，看上去犹如一道镶着灰色花边的月光，而且，让我欢天喜地的是，她请我带她进去吃饭。我们坐下来之后，我十分直率地说道：‘我想，不久前，我在邦德街瞥见过你，阿尔罗伊夫人。’她脸色煞白，用很低的声音对我说：‘请不要这么大声说话，也许会让别人听到。’我对自己开了个差劲的头而感觉糟糕，接着就自顾自地谈起了法国戏剧这个话题。她说话很少，总是以相同的低沉悦耳的声音说话，好像她是怕有人在听似的。我热烈而又愚蠢地堕入了情网，包围着她的神秘莫名的气氛引起了我最强烈的好奇心。晚饭后不久，当她要离开的时候，我问她，我可不可以去拜访她。她犹豫了一会儿，环顾四周，看有没有人在我们周围，然后说道：‘可以，明天四点四十五分。’我恳求德·拉斯提尔夫人告诉我有关她的情况，但我所能了解到的一切就是，她是一位寡妇，在公园路有一座漂亮的房子。某个无聊的家伙开始从科学的角度就寡妇这个话题发表一番长篇大论，举例论证婚姻中优胜劣汰、适者生存，于是我就告辞回家去了。

“第二天，我准时到达了公园路，但管家告诉我说，阿尔罗伊夫人刚刚出去了。我闷闷不乐，百思不解，去了俱乐部，经过一番考虑后给她写了一封信，询问我可不可以获准改天下午去试试运气。我好几天没有得到回复，但最后收到了一个小纸条，上面写着她星期天下午四点钟会在家里，还有一段奇怪的附言，‘请不要再往这里给我写信。我见到你的时候会解释的。’星期天，她接待了我，真是千娇百媚。而当我要离开的时候，她恳求我说，如果我有机会再次给她写信，就要‘由格林大街惠特克图书馆诺克斯太太转交’。‘我不能在自己的房子里收信是有原因的。’她说。

“那一季，我见了她很多次，而神秘的气氛从来没有离开过她。有时候，我觉得她是在某个人的控制下，但看上去她是那样难以接近，我无法确定。这真是很难让我下任何结论，因为她就像人们在博物馆里看到的一种奇异水晶，时而清晰，时而模糊。最终，我决定娶她做我的妻子：她对我的所有拜访和寄给她的几封信都一直保密，这些我都厌倦透了。我往她给的图书馆地址给她写信，问她下星期一晚上六点钟能不能见我。她的回答是肯定的，我开心极了。我对她心醉神迷：尽管她很神秘，但我当时还是想——离明了一切的那天不远了。不，我爱的是这个女人本身。她有一个秘密困扰着我，使我发疯。为什么碰巧要让我撞上呢？”

“这么说，是你发现了那个秘密？”我嚷道。

“恐怕是这样，”他回答说，“你可以自己判断。”

“星期一的时候，我跟我叔叔一起吃午饭，之后四点钟左右走到马里波恩路。你知道，我叔叔住在摄政公园。我想要去皮卡迪利大街，就穿过许多破旧的小街走了捷径。突然，我看到阿尔罗伊夫人出现在我面前，只见她戴着厚厚的面纱，走得很快。到达大街上的最后一座房子的时候，她走上台阶，掏出一把弹簧锁钥匙，自己走了进去。‘秘密就在这里。’我自言自语，匆匆往前，仔细察看了房子。这好像是一个出租房间的地方。门前的台阶上躺着她掉落的手帕。我把它捡起来，装进了口袋，随后开始考虑我应该做什么。我最后得出结论，我没有权利暗自监视她，就乘车去了俱乐部。到了六点钟，我去看望她。只见她躺在沙发上，身穿银色薄纱茶礼服，上面装饰着她喜欢的奇异月光石。她十分可爱。‘我很高兴见到你，’她说，‘我一整天都没出门。’我惊讶地盯着她，从口袋里掏出那块手帕，递给她。‘阿尔罗伊夫人，你今天下午把这个掉在了卡姆纳街上。’我平心静气地说。她恐惧地望着我，但没有接手帕。‘你当时在那里干什么？’我问。‘你有什么权利盘问我？’她反问道。‘是一个爱你的人的权利，’我回答说，‘我到这里是来请你做我的妻子的。’她把脸埋在双手里，泪如泉涌。‘你一定要告诉我。’我继续说道。她站起来，直视着我的脸，说道：‘默奇森勋爵，我没有什么可以告诉你的。’——‘你去会见某个人，’我嚷道，‘这就是你的秘密。’她脸色白得可怕，说道：‘我没有去会见任何人。’——‘难道你不能说实话吗？’我大声嚷道。‘我说的就是实话。’她答道。我发疯发狂，不知道当时说了什么，但我对她说了糟糕的话。最后，我冲出了那个房子。第二天，她给我写了一封信。我没有拆开就把信寄了回去，然后跟艾伦·科尔维尔启程前往挪威。一个月后，我返回巴黎，在《晨邮报》上看到的第一件事就是阿尔罗伊夫人的死讯。她在歌剧院受寒，五天后死于肺部充血。我把自己关起来，谁也不见。我曾经是如此爱她，我曾经那样疯狂地爱她。天哪！我曾经多么爱那个女人啊！”

“你后来又去那条街的房子了吗？”我问。

“去了。”他回答。

“有一天，我去了卡姆纳街。我没办法不去，疑问折磨着我。我敲了敲门，一位模样可敬的女士给我打开了门。我问她有没有房间出租。‘噢，先生，’她回答说，‘客厅应该可以出租。可是，我三个月都没有看到那位太太了，这房间都还欠着租金，不过你可以租。’——‘是这位太太吗？’我拿出照片说。‘毫无疑问，就是她，’她大声说道，‘她什么时候回来，先生？’‘这位太太死了。’我回答。‘噢，先生，真遗憾！’那个女人说，‘她是我最好的房客。她每星期付给我三几尼[6]，只是不时地在我的客厅里坐坐。’——‘她在这里见过什么人吗？’我问道。可是，那个女人向我保证说情况不是这样，她总是独自前来，没有见过什么人。‘她到底在这里做什么呢？’我嚷道。‘先生，她只是坐在客厅里，看看书，有时喝喝茶。’那个女人回答说。我不知道该说什么，于是给了她一金镑[7]就走了。现在，你认为这一切是什么意思？你难道不相信那个女人当时说的是真话吗？”

“我相信。”

“这么说，阿尔罗伊夫人为什么去那里？”

“我亲爱的杰拉德，”我回答说，“阿尔罗伊夫人只是一个热衷于营造神秘感的女人。她租这些房间，是为了戴着面纱来这里，想象自己是一个女主角。她对于神秘感无比狂热，但她自己不过是一个没有秘密的斯芬克斯。”

“你真这样想吗？”

“这一点我可以肯定。”我答道。

他掏出摩洛哥羊皮盒子，打开来，看着那张照片。“是这样吗？”他最后说道。

模范百万富翁

——一个惊叹号


一个人除非是富人，否则即便是一个迷人的家伙也白搭。浪漫是富人的特权，而不是穷人的行当。穷人应该务实平凡。收入稳定，胜过富有魅力。这些都是现代生活的伟大真理，休伊·厄斯金却从来没有意识到这些。可怜的休伊！从理智上来说，我们必须承认，他无足轻重。他一辈子从来没有说过生花妙语，也没有对谁恶语相向过。不过，他一头鬈曲的褐色头发、轮廓鲜明的五官和灰色的眼睛格外好看。他跟男人们在一起时像跟女人们在一起时一样受欢迎，除了赚钱，他样样在行。他的父亲留给了他一把马刀和一套十五卷的《半岛战争史》。休伊将马刀挂在穿衣镜上，把《半岛战争史》放在《拉夫指南》和《贝利杂志》之间的架子上，靠一位老姑妈给他的两百英镑年金生活。他什么工作都尝试过了。他曾经在证券交易所买卖过六个月股票。但是，一只蝴蝶在牛市和熊市之间能做什么呢？他当茶叶商的时间稍长些，但很快就厌倦了白毫茶[1]和小种茶[2]。之后，他曾试图出售干雪利酒，那酒却也不合人口味，味道有些太淡了。最终，他一事无成，成了一个讨人喜欢、没有出息的年轻人，模样精致，一无所有。

更糟糕的是，他还在谈情说爱。他爱的女孩劳拉·默顿是一位退休上校的女儿。上校在印度失去了绝好的脾气和胃口，从此再没找回来过。劳拉爱慕他，而他也情愿去吻她的鞋带。他们是伦敦最漂亮的情侣，却身无分文。上校非常喜欢休伊，但拒绝考虑任何订婚之事。

“我的孩子，当你有一万英镑的时候，再来找我，我们再考虑这件事。”他常常这么说。那些日子休伊一副闷闷不乐的样子，不得不去找劳拉寻求安慰。

一天早上，在前往默顿家所在的荷兰公园的途中，他顺便走访了自己的好友艾伦·特雷弗。特雷弗是一位画家。实际上，如今的人们不是画家的寥寥无几。不过，他也是一位艺术家，艺术家则相当罕见。他本人是一个奇怪粗暴的家伙，一脸雀斑，红髯蓬乱。然而，当拿起画笔的时候，他是一位真正的大师，他的画作受到人们的热烈追捧。一开始，他就十分喜欢休伊，我们必须承认这完全是因为他的个人魅力。“画家唯一应该认识的人，”他常说，“是愚蠢而又美丽的人，是看起来赏心悦目，谈起天来蠢笨无聊的人。花花公子和漂亮女人统治世界，至少他们应该这样做。”不过，渐渐地熟悉休伊之后，他也喜欢上了对方愉快活跃的性情和大方率真的本性，并允许他自由进出自己的画室。

休伊进来的时候，发现特雷弗正在给一幅乞丐肖像画画最后几笔。乞丐本人站在画室角落的一个高台上。这是一个干瘪的老头，脸像皱羊皮纸似的，一副可怜巴巴的表情，肩上搭着一件质地粗劣、破烂不堪的棕色外衣，厚靴子补丁摞补丁，一只手拄着一根粗糙的拐杖，另一只手伸出破帽子来请求施舍。

“一位令人震惊的模特！”休伊一边跟朋友握手，一边低声说道。

“令人震惊的模特？”特雷弗扯着嗓子嚷道，“我想的确如此！他这样的乞丐不是每天都会遇到的。一次意外的收获，亲爱的，[3]一幅活生生的媲美委拉斯开兹[4]的画！我的天哪！要是让伦勃朗来画他，他一定会做出一幅蚀刻版画！”

“可怜的老头儿！”休伊说，“看上去他是多么痛苦！不过，我想，对你们画家来说，他的脸所呈现的正是他的生活？”

“当然了，”特雷弗回答说，“你不可能指望一个乞丐面露喜色，对不对？”

“当一个模特让人画能挣多少钱？”休伊在一张舒服的长沙发上坐下来问道。

“一个小时一先令。”

“那你的画挣多少钱，艾伦？”

“噢，这个我挣两千！”

“英镑？”

“几尼。画家、诗人和医生得到的总是几尼。”

“嗯，我认为这些钱模特也应该分得一部分，”休伊笑着大声说道，“他们工作时像你一样努力。”

“胡说，胡说！啊，看看仅仅涂抹颜料有多么麻烦，还要一天到晚站在画架边！休伊，你说得很对，但你应该相信，有些时候艺术工作几乎应该得到和体力工作一样的尊敬。不过，你也不要喋喋不休，我很忙。抽一支烟，保持安静。”

过了一段时间，仆人进来，告诉特雷弗说画框制造商想和他说话。

“休伊，不要跑开，”他一边说，一边走了出去，“我去去就来。”

老乞丐趁特雷弗不在，便去他身后的木凳上休息。他看上去是那样无助又可怜，休伊不由得怜悯他，在口袋里摸了摸，看自己有多少钱。他所能找到的只有一枚金币和一些铜币。“可怜的老家伙，”他暗自想道，“他比我更需要钱，给他这些钱只不过意味着我两星期不坐马车罢了。”他穿过画室，然后把那枚金币轻轻地放在了乞丐的手里。

老人猛地一惊，干瘪的嘴唇掠过一丝淡淡的微笑。“谢谢你，先生，”他说，“谢谢你。”

随后，特雷弗赶到，休伊告辞，对自己做的事儿感到有些脸红。他跟劳拉一起待了一天，为自己的挥霍破费挨了一顿可爱的责骂，最后只好步行回家。

那天夜里十一点左右，他漫步至调色板俱乐部，发现特雷弗独自坐在抽烟室里喝着加了苏打水的白葡萄酒。

“好吧，艾伦，你那幅画画好了吗？”他一边说，一边点起了一支烟。

“画好了，也装上了框，我的伙计！”特雷弗回答，“还有，顺便说一下，你已经征服了那个人。你看到的那个老模特完全被你迷住了。我只好告诉他有关你的一切——你是谁，你住在哪里，你的收入是多少，你有什么前途——”

“我亲爱的艾伦，”休伊嚷道，“我回家的时候，可能会发现他在等着我。不过，当然，你只是在开玩笑。可怜的老家伙！我真希望我能为他做些什么。我认为，这种凄惨境况对于任何人都是可怕的。我家里有几堆旧衣服——你认为他会喜欢吗？唉，他的衣服都破成了烂布条。”

“不过，他穿上去很棒，”特雷弗说，“他如果穿着长礼服，我无论如何也不会画他。你称为破布的东西，我却称其为浪漫。在你看来等于贫困的东西，在我看来却是生动逼真的形象。不过，我会把你的提议告诉他的。”

“艾伦，”休伊严肃地说，“你们画家真是无情。”

“艺术家只有脑袋，没有良心，”特雷弗说，“再说，我们的职责是让我们看到的世界显得逼真，而不是改良我们了解的世界。每个人都有自己的职业。[5]现在告诉我劳拉怎么样了。老模特对她很感兴趣。”

“你不会对他谈起过她吧？”休伊说。

“我当然谈了。他对无情的上校、可爱的劳拉和一万英镑都了如指掌。”

“你把我所有的私事都告诉了老乞丐吗？”休伊气得满脸通红，大声嚷道。

“我亲爱的孩子，”特雷弗微笑着说，“你所称的那个老乞丐是欧洲最富有的人之一。他不用透支自己的账户，明天就可以买下整个伦敦。他在每个国家的首都都有一座房子，用金盘吃饭，他要是喜欢，还能阻止俄国开战呢。”

“你到底是什么意思？”休伊大声问道。

“我说的是，”特雷弗说，“你今天在画室看到的那个老头是豪斯伯格男爵。他是我的一位好朋友，几乎买下了我所有的画作，一个月前他给了我佣金，要我画一幅乞丐的画像。你会这么想吗？这是一个百万富翁的心血来潮！[6]我必须说，他穿着他的破衣烂衫，样子真是棒极了，或许我应该说穿着我的破衣烂衫，那是我在西班牙买的。”

“豪斯伯格男爵！”休伊嚷道，“天哪！我给了他一枚金币！”说完，他一屁股坐到扶手椅里，一副沮丧的样子。

“给了他一枚金币！”特雷弗突然哈哈大笑，大声嚷道，“我亲爱的伙计，你永远不会再看到它了。他拿别人的钱做生意。[7]”

“艾伦，我想你本应该告诉我，”休伊闷闷不乐地说，“不应该让我出这样的洋相。”

“噢，首先，休伊，”特雷弗说，“我从来没有想过，你会这样不假思索地到处施舍。你亲吻一个漂亮的模特我能理解，可你居然给一个丑陋的模特一枚金币——天哪，我不理解！此外，实际上，我今天真的没有准备接待任何人。你进来的时候，我不知道豪斯伯格愿不愿意让我提起他的名字。你知道他当时没有穿礼服。”

“他一定认为我是个笨蛋！”休伊说。

“一点也不。你离开后，他兴致再好不过了，不停地暗自发笑，来回搓着他布满皱纹的老手。我当时不明白为什么他那么有兴趣了解你的一切，可我现在全都明白了。休伊，他会用你的金币投资，每半年付给你一次利息，晚饭后也有一个精彩的故事可讲了。”

“我是个倒霉鬼，”休伊咆哮着说，“我能做得最好的事情就是去上床睡觉。还有，我亲爱的艾伦，你可千万不能告诉别人这件事，否则我就别想在这条街上见人了。”

“胡说！这件事说明了你心地仁慈，你应当引以为豪，休伊。不要跑掉。再来一根香烟，你可以再跟我多聊聊劳拉。”

然而，休伊不愿停留，而是感到闷闷不乐，走回了家，留下艾伦·特雷弗在身后发出一阵阵笑声。

第二天早上，他吃早餐的时候，仆人给他送来一张卡片，上面写着：古斯塔夫·诺丹先生，代表豪斯伯格男爵。“我想他是来要求我道歉的。”休伊自言自语地说。他吩咐仆人把来客领上来。

一位戴着金丝眼镜、头发花白的老先生走进房间，略带法国口音说道：“请问您是厄斯金先生吗？”

休伊点了点头。

“我是从豪斯伯格男爵那里来的，”他继续说道，“男爵——”

“先生，我恳求你给他带去我最诚挚的歉意。”休伊结结巴巴地说。

“男爵，”老先生面带微笑说，“委托我给你带来这封信。”说着，他递过来一个密封的信封。

信封外面写着：“一个老乞丐送给休·厄斯金和劳拉·默顿的结婚礼物。”里面还有一张一万英镑的支票。

他们结婚的时候，艾伦·特雷弗是伴郎，男爵在婚礼早餐上发表了祝词。

“百万富翁模特，”艾伦说，“真够罕见的。可是，天哪，模范百万富翁更罕见！”

亚瑟·萨维尔勋爵之罪

——一项责任的研究


第一章


这是复活节前温德米尔夫人的最后一次招待会，本廷克住宅甚至比平时更加拥挤。六位内阁部长佩戴勋章和缎带从众议院主席的招待会赶来，所有漂亮的女人都穿着最漂亮的礼服。卡尔斯鲁厄[1]的索菲娅公主站在画廊尽头，她是一位身体笨重、鞑靼人样的小姐，长着一双小黑眼睛，戴着美轮美奂的翡翠，扯开嗓门说着蹩脚的法语，无论对方说什么，她都纵声大笑。这肯定是一道奇妙的人群大杂烩。雍容华贵的贵夫人们和颜悦色地跟性情暴烈的激进分子聊了起来；受人欢迎的传教士们跟赫赫有名的怀疑论者擦着大衣后摆而行；一群主教一直跟着一位身材矮胖的女高音，从一个房间走到另一个房间；好几位皇家院士伪装成艺术家站在楼梯上。据说，晚餐室一度挤满了天才人物。实际上，这是温德米尔夫人家最棒的一个夜晚，后来公主一直逗留到将近十一点半才离开。

公主一走，温德米尔夫人就回到了画廊，那里一位大名鼎鼎的政治经济学家正在郑重其事地给一名看上去很气愤的匈牙利演奏家讲解音乐的科学理论，她开始跟佩斯利公爵夫人交谈起来。公爵夫人看上去美艳惊人，象牙白的高贵的颈项，一双勿忘我般的蓝眼睛，一头浓密的金色卷发。卷发是纯金色的——不是如今这种经常盗用金子雅号的暗淡的稻草黄，而是那种织入阳光或隐藏在奇异琥珀中的颜色。这种颜色给了她的脸几分圣人的模样，毫无罪魅之风。她是一位好奇的心理学研究者。早年，她已经发现了那个重要事实，就是再没有比纯真和轻率更为相似的东西了。通过一系列不顾一切的出轨行为——其中一半完全无害——她已经获得了名人的所有殊荣。她不止一次地换过丈夫，《德布雷特》[2]的确记载过她的三次婚姻。但是，她从来没有换过情人，这个世界早已不再谈论她的丑闻了。她现年四十岁，没有子女，而那种热衷享乐的激情成了她保持年轻的秘诀。

突然，温德米尔夫人急切地环顾房间，用清晰的女低音问道：“我的手相师在哪里？”

“你的什么，格拉迪斯？”公爵夫人突然不由自主地大声问道。

“我的手相师，公爵夫人。眼下没有他，我活不了。”

“亲爱的格拉迪斯！你总是这样与众不同。”公爵夫人一边喃喃说着，一边试图去想一个手相师（chiromantist）在现实生活中会是什么样子，希望他跟手足病大夫（chiropodist）不太一样。

“他每星期两次定期来看我的手，”温德米尔夫人接着说道，“而且对我的手极其关注。”

“天哪！”公爵夫人自言自语地说，“他真的是某种手足病大夫。真是可怕极了。我希望他至少是一个外国人，那就不会那么糟了。”

“我一定要把他介绍给你们。”

“介绍他！”公爵夫人嚷道，“你不是说他在这里吧？”她开始四处寻找她的小玳瑁扇子和那条破旧的花边披肩，以便准备好随时离去。

“当然，他在这里，没有他，我做梦也不会想要举行宴会。他告诉我说，我有一只纯净的通灵之手，如果我的拇指再短一点的话，我应该就是一个根深蒂固的悲观主义者，早已进了修道院。”

“噢，我明白了！”公爵夫人说，感到如释重负，“我想他会算好运吧？”

“也算厄运，”温德米尔夫人答道，“什么厄运都会算。比如，无论是陆路还是海路出行，明年我都有极大的危险，所以我得乘氢气球，每天晚上在篮子里吃晚餐。所有的一切都写在我的小拇指或手掌上，我忘记是哪一个了。”

“可这真是在考验上帝，格拉迪斯。”

“我亲爱的公爵夫人，上帝在这个时候肯定能经受住考验。我认为，每个人每个月都应该让人看一下手相，以便知道不能做什么。当然，人总会去做一些事，但得到提醒是一件非常令人愉快的事儿。现在，如果没有人马上去请伯杰斯先生，那我就亲自去了。”

“温德米尔夫人，让我去吧。”一个高大帅气的小伙子说道，只见他站在旁边，面带微笑地倾听着他们的谈话。

“非常感谢，亚瑟勋爵。可我怕你认不出他。”

“温德米尔夫人，如果他像你说的那样奇妙的话，我就完全不可能忽略他。告诉我，他什么模样，我会马上把他带到你身边。”

“啊，他一点也不像手相师。我是说，他看上去既不神秘难懂，也不风雅浪漫。他又矮又胖，秃顶而滑稽，戴着金边大眼镜，既像家庭医生又像乡村律师。我真的很抱歉，但这不是我的过错。这些人就是如此讨厌。我所有的钢琴师看起来都像诗人，而所有的诗人都像钢琴师。记得上个季节我请一个极其可怕的阴谋家吃饭，这个人曾炸死过好多人，总是穿着铠甲，衬衫的袖子里藏着一把匕首。你知道吗？他来的时候就像一个善良的老牧师，整个晚上都说着笑话。当然，他非常有趣，如此等等，但却让我大失所望。当我问他有关铠甲的问题的时候，他只是呵呵一笑，说英国冷死了，穿不了。啊，这就是伯杰斯先生！现在，伯杰斯先生，我想要你给佩斯利公爵夫人看一下手相。公爵夫人，你必须摘下手套。不，不是左手，是另一只手。”

“亲爱的格拉迪斯，我真的觉得这样不太好。”公爵夫人一边说着，一边有气无力地解开一只有些脏的小山羊皮白手套的扣子。

“没有什么总是有趣的东西。”温德米尔夫人说，“世道就是这样。[3]可我必须向你介绍。公爵夫人，这是我心爱的手相师伯杰斯先生。伯杰斯先生，这是佩斯利公爵夫人，如果你说她有比我更大的月亮丘[4]，我就再也不会相信你了。”

“格拉迪斯，我敢肯定我的手没有这种事儿。”公爵夫人神情严肃地说。

“夫人完全正确，”伯杰斯先生瞥了一眼那只长着又短又方的指头的手说，“月亮丘没有发育成熟。不过，生命线极好。请弯曲手腕。谢谢你。腕纹上有三条明显的线！公爵夫人，你会长寿，而且特别幸福。野心——非常克制，智慧线不突出，感情线……”

“伯杰斯先生，现在请放开来说。”温德米尔夫人嚷道。

“承蒙厚爱，”伯杰斯先生鞠躬说，“但我很抱歉地说，我看到了跟强烈的责任感相结合的伟大而又持久的感情。”

“请说下去，伯杰斯先生。”公爵夫人说，一副乐呵呵的样子。

“善于理财是夫人最大的美德。”伯杰斯先生接着说道，温德米尔夫人突然发出了一阵阵笑声。

“善于理财是一大好事，”公爵夫人得意地说，“当我嫁给佩斯利的时候，他有十一座城堡，而不是一座适合居住的房子。”

“而现在，他有十二座房子，却一座城堡也没有了。”温德米尔夫人嚷道。

“噢，亲爱的，”公爵夫人说，“我喜欢——”

“舒适，”伯杰斯先生说，“和现代化的改进设施，以及在每间卧室安装的热水系统。夫人完全正确。舒适是我们的文明能够给我们的唯一的东西。”

“伯杰斯先生，你出色地讲述了公爵夫人的性格，现在你必须讲一下弗洛拉夫人的性格。”一个身材高挑的姑娘从沙发后面笨手笨脚地走过来，向面带微笑的女主人点头回应，只见她一头淡茶色的苏格兰人的头发，高高的肩胛骨，伸出一只瘦骨嶙峋、竹片状指头的长手。

“啊，是一位钢琴家！我明白了，”伯杰斯先生说，“一位出色的钢琴家，但也许算不上音乐家。非常内敛，老老实实，而且十分喜爱动物。”

“确实如此！”公爵夫人转向温德米尔夫人大声嚷道，“绝对正确！弗洛拉在麦克罗斯基养了两打牧羊犬，如果她的父亲允许的话，她就会把我们的联排别墅变成动物园。”

“嗯，每个星期四晚上我的房子都是那样，”温德米尔夫人笑着大声说道，“只是我更喜欢狮子，不喜欢牧羊犬。”

“你这么说就不对了，温德米尔夫人。”伯杰斯先生夸张地鞠了一躬说。

“如果一个女人不能使她犯的错误变得迷人，那她就只是一个女性。”温德米尔夫人回答，“但你必须给我们多看看手相。来吧，托马斯爵士，让伯杰斯先生看看你的手。”一位模样和善，身穿白色背心的老先生走上前，伸出一只粗糙的厚手，中指很长。

“天性喜欢冒险。过去进行过四次漫长的航行，将来还要进行一次。曾经遇到过三次海难。不，只有两次，但下一次旅程会面临一次海难。是一个强硬的保守派，非常守时，十分热衷于收集古玩。十六到十八岁之间得过一次严重的疾病。三十岁时得到一笔遗产。十分讨厌猫和激进分子。”

“不同凡响！”托马斯爵士大声嚷道，“你一定也要实实在在地给我的妻子看看手相。”

“你的第二任妻子，”伯杰斯先生仍然把托马斯爵士的手放在他的手里，平静地说，“你的第二任妻子的手相。我会被迷住的。”但是，神情忧郁、长着棕色的头发和多情的睫毛的马弗尔太太完全拒绝把她的过去或将来暴露给别人。温德米尔夫人做的任何事情也都劝说不了俄罗斯大使德·科洛夫先生，即便只是摘下他的手套。实际上，许多人似乎不敢面对那个奇怪的小个子，只见他面带一成不变的微笑，戴着金丝眼镜，一双眼睛亮晶晶、圆溜溜的。他在大家面前直截了当地告诉可怜的弗莫尔太太，说她一点也不喜欢音乐，但特别喜欢音乐家，这时人们普遍感到手相学是一种极其危险的科学，而且是一种不应该得到鼓励的科学，只适合于一对一的私人场合。

然而，亚瑟·萨维尔勋爵对弗莫尔太太的不幸遭遇一无所知，一直在兴致勃勃地观察伯杰斯先生，充满了极大的好奇心，想让他给自己看看手相。他感觉有些害羞，不敢自己上前，就穿过房间，走到温德米尔夫人坐的地方，然后脸带迷人的红晕，问她认为伯杰斯先生会不会介意给他看手相。

“当然，他不会介意，”温德米尔夫人说，“这就是他此行的目的。亚瑟勋爵，我所有的狮子都是耍把戏的，无论我什么时候叫他们跳圈他们都得跳。可我必须事先警告你，我要把一切都告诉西比尔。她明天要来跟我一起吃午饭，谈论帽子，如果伯杰斯先生发现你有坏脾气，有痛风的倾向，或者有一个生活在贝斯沃特[5]的妻子，我就一定会让她知道所有的事情。”

亚瑟勋爵微微一笑，摇了摇头。“我不怕，”他回答说，“西比尔了解我，就像我了解她一样。”

“啊！听到你这么说，我有点儿遗憾。婚姻的良好基础是对彼此的误解。不，我一点儿也不愤世嫉俗，我只是经历了几乎与之相同的事儿而有了经验。伯杰斯先生，亚瑟·萨维尔勋爵期望有人给他看手相。不要告诉他说他跟伦敦最漂亮的一个女孩订婚了，因为《晨邮报》一个月前就刊登了这件事。”

“亲爱的温德米尔夫人，”杰德堡的侯爵夫人嚷道，“请让伯杰斯先生在这里再待一小会儿。他刚刚告诉我说我应该登台，我很感兴趣。”

“杰德堡夫人，如果他这样告诉你的话，我就一定要把他带走。伯杰斯先生，马上过来，给亚瑟勋爵看看手相。”

“好吧，”说着，杰德堡夫人从沙发上起身的时候稍微噘了噘嘴，“如果不准我登台，那就好歹也让我当一名观众。”

“当然可以，我们都是观众中的一员。”温德米尔夫人说，“现在，伯杰斯先生，务必告诉我们一件好事。亚瑟勋爵是我最爱的贵宾之一。”

但是，伯杰斯先生看到亚瑟勋爵的手，脸色变得出奇的惨白，一句话也没说。他似乎在全身发抖，浓浓的眉毛以奇怪、恼火的方式痉挛性地抽搐了一下，每当他迷惑不解的时候就是这样。随后，几颗大大的汗珠从他黄色的额头上冒出，就像有毒的露水一般，他的胖手指也变得又湿又冷。

亚瑟勋爵也察觉到了这些奇怪躁动的迹象，而且他自己有生以来第一次感到了恐惧。他想冲出房间，但他克制住了自己。无论如何，了解最坏的情况要比被留在这种可怕的悬疑中好。

“我在等待，伯杰斯先生。”他说。

“我们都在等待。”温德米尔夫人以快速而心急的口气嚷道，但手相师没有回答。

“我相信亚瑟要登台，”杰德堡夫人说，“而且，你责骂之后，伯杰斯先生不敢这样告诉他。”

突然，伯杰斯先生放下亚瑟勋爵的右手，一把抓住他的左手，腰弯得很低，仔细观察，眼镜的金边几乎擦到了亚瑟勋爵的手掌。一时间，他的脸变成了一副恐怖的白色面具，但他很快就恢复了镇静，抬头望着温德米尔夫人，勉强笑道：“这是一双迷人的小伙子的手。”

“当然是！”温德米尔夫人回答说，“但他会是一个迷人的丈夫吗？这就是我想知道的。”

“所有迷人的小伙子都是。”伯杰斯先生说。

“我认为丈夫不应该太迷人，”杰德堡夫人闷闷不乐地喃喃说道，“这很危险。”

“我亲爱的孩子，他们从来都不会太迷人，”温德米尔夫人嚷道，“但我想要的是细节。细节是唯一有趣的东西。亚瑟勋爵会发生什么事儿？”

“啊，在接下来的几个月里，亚瑟将进行一次航行——”

“噢，是的，当然是他的蜜月！”

“而且会失去一个亲戚。”

“我想不是他的妹妹吧？”杰德堡夫人用慈悲的语调问道。

“当然不是他的妹妹，”伯杰斯先生不以为然地挥了挥手答道，“只是一个远房亲戚。”

“唉，我失望极了，”温德米尔夫人说，“我明天绝对没有什么要告诉西比尔的。如今，没有人关心远亲。几年前他们就过时了。不过，我想她最好有一身黑色丝绸衣服，你知道黑色丝绸衣服在教堂总是有用的。现在让我们一起去吃晚饭吧。他们一定把大部分食物都吃掉了，但我们可能还会发现一些热汤。弗朗索瓦过去经常做得一手好汤，但他现在对政治非常焦虑，所以我对他不再有任何把握。我真希望布朗热将军[6]能保持安静。公爵夫人，我相信你累了吧？”

“一点也不累，亲爱的格拉迪斯，”公爵夫人一边回答，一边朝门口摇摇晃晃地走去，“我非常开心，手足病大夫，我是说手相师，有趣极了。弗洛拉，我的玳瑁扇子在哪里呢？噢，非常感谢，托马斯爵士。我的蕾丝披肩呢，弗洛拉？噢，谢谢你，托马斯爵士，你真是太好了。”说完，这个可敬的人儿终于设法到了楼下，中间也只把她的香水瓶子掉了两次。

这段时间亚瑟·萨维尔勋爵一直站在壁炉旁边，他身上的恐惧感依旧没有退去，还有对于不幸即将降临的胆战心惊。当他姐姐挽着普莱姆代尔勋爵的胳膊从他身边飘然走过的时候，他对姐姐苦笑了一下，只见她穿着粉红锦缎衣服，戴着珍珠，可爱极了。温德米尔夫人叫他跟着她的时候，他几乎没有听见。他想起了西比尔·默顿，想起了他们之间可能发生的一切，顿时泪眼模糊。

看着他，有人会说，涅墨西斯[7]窃取了帕拉斯[8]的盾牌之后，给他看了戈耳工[9]的头。他似乎变成了石头，忧郁的脸庞像是大理石做的一般。他生下来就过着一种富裕、精致和奢华的生活，这种生活摆脱了一切肮脏的想法，是一种美丽天真、无忧无虑的生活。现在他第一次感觉到了命运的不祥的神秘感，以及“末日”一词的可怕含义。

这一切看上去是多么疯狂和怪异啊！难道这种他自己看不懂、另一个人却能破解的写在他手上的符号，是某种罪恶的可怕秘密，或某种罪行的血红标志？难道没有逃脱的可能吗？我们是不是比被看不见的力量移动的棋子、依陶工的想象捏出的陶器更好呢？这一切是荣是辱？他的理性厌恶这一点，但他觉得某个悲剧正在围绕着他，使他必须得突然承受他无法承受的负担。演员们都非常幸运。他们可以选择他们愿不愿意出现在悲剧或喜剧里，他们愿不愿意受苦或作乐，欢笑或流泪。但在现实生活中，这是不一样的。大多数男人和女人被迫要扮演他们完全不胜任的角色。我们的吉尔登斯特恩[10]为我们扮演哈姆雷特，我们的哈姆雷特必须像哈尔王子一样会开玩笑。世界是一个舞台，但演员戏演得并不好。

突然，伯杰斯先生走进了房间。他看到亚瑟勋爵的时候吃了一惊，粗俗的胖脸变成了某种黄绿色。两个人目光相遇，一时间沉默了下来。

“亚瑟勋爵，公爵夫人把她的一只手套落在了这里，要求我把它带给她。”伯杰斯先生最后说道，“啊，我看到它在沙发上！晚安。”

“伯杰斯先生，我要问你一个问题，我一定要你给我一个直截了当的回答。”

“亚瑟勋爵，下一次吧，公爵夫人着急。恐怕我得走了。”

“你不能走。公爵夫人不急。”

“亚瑟勋爵，不应该让太太们一直等待，”伯杰斯先生苦笑着说，“女性容易急躁。”

亚瑟勋爵轮廓鲜明的嘴唇急躁而又不屑地噘起。可怜的公爵夫人似乎对他无足轻重。他穿过房间，走到伯杰斯先生站立的地方，伸出了一只手。

“告诉我，你在那里看到了什么，”他说，“告诉我真相。我必须知道这一点。我不是一个孩子了。”

伯杰斯先生的眼睛在金丝眼镜后面眨了眨，他不安地来回移动着两只脚，手指紧张地摆弄着一条闪光的表链。

“亚瑟勋爵，除了我说过的之外，是什么让你认为我从你手里还看到了别的东西？”

“我知道你看到了，我坚决要求你告诉我那是什么。我会付给你钱。我会给你一百英镑的支票。”

绿眼睛闪了一下，随后又暗了下去。

“几尼？”伯杰斯先生最后用低沉的声音问道。

“当然。我明天会送你一张支票。你的俱乐部在哪里？”

“我没有参加什么俱乐部。也就是说，只是目前没有。我的地址是——不过，还是让我把名片给你吧。”说着，伯杰斯先生从背心口袋里掏出一小张镶金边的卡片，深深地鞠了一躬后递给亚瑟勋爵。勋爵念着上面的字：





塞普蒂莫斯·R.伯杰斯先生

专业手相师

西月街1030号





“我的待客时间从十点钟到下午四点钟，”伯杰斯先生机械地说道，“家庭服务打折。”

“快。”亚瑟勋爵嚷道，脸色惨白，伸出一只手来。

伯杰斯先生紧张地看了看周围，拉上厚厚的门帘。

“亚瑟勋爵，这需要一点时间，你最好坐下来。”

“快，先生。”亚瑟勋爵在光滑的地板上愤怒地跺着脚，又一次嚷道。

伯杰斯先生微微一笑，从胸袋里掏出一只小小的放大镜，用手帕仔细地擦了擦。

“我完全准备好了。”他说。





第二章


十分钟后，亚瑟·萨维尔勋爵恐惧得脸色惨白，眼神狂乱而悲伤，从本廷克住宅冲了出来，一路闯过一群围站在大条纹遮阳篷四周的身穿皮衣的男仆，似乎什么都没有看到，什么都没有听到。夜晚严寒，广场四周的汽灯发出的光在凛冽的寒风中闪动摇曳着。但是，他手热发烫，额头火烧火燎。他继续走啊走，简直像是醉汉的步态。他走过去的时候，一名警察好奇地看着他；一个乞丐在拱门下面无精打采地乞讨，看到他比自己更加痛苦，越发害怕起来。有一次，他停在了一盏灯下面，看着自己的双手。他认为他可以察觉到血迹已经沾在了双手上，一阵微弱的叫声从他颤抖的嘴唇里迸发出来。

谋杀！这正是手相师在那里看到的。谋杀！那个夜晚似乎知道这一点，荒凉的风在他的耳朵里呼啸。连街道黑暗的角落都充满了这个字眼。它从房子的屋顶冲他龇牙狞笑着。

他首先来到海德公园，公园暗淡的林地似乎迷住了他。他疲惫地靠在栏杆上，眉头贴在湿漉漉的金属上降温，倾听着树木的颤抖着的沉默。“谋杀！谋杀！”他不停地重复着，好像重复可以使这个词不那么恐惧。他自己的声音使他不寒而栗，但他几乎希望回声能听到他的声音，将沉睡的城市从梦中唤醒。他觉得心里有一种疯狂的欲望，想拦住漫不经心的路人，并告诉他所有的一切。

随后，他漫步走过牛津街，走进一条条狭窄肮脏的小巷。他走过的时候，两个涂脂抹粉的女人嘲笑他。一个黑暗的院子里传来了一阵咒骂声和殴打声，随后传来了刺耳的尖叫声。他看到了那些穷人和老人们驼着背蜷缩在潮湿的门阶上，心里掠过了一阵莫名其妙的怜悯之情。这些身处罪恶和苦难中的孩子也注定要像他那样灭亡吗？他们像他一样仅仅是一出荒谬表演中的傀儡吗？

然而，击中他的不是苦难的神秘感，而是它的荒谬，是它彻底的无价值以及怪诞的意义缺失。一切都显得如此支离破碎！如此缺乏和谐！他对当时的肤浅乐观和实际事实之间的不一致惊讶不已。他还很年轻。

过了一段时间，他发现自己到了马里波恩教堂前面。沉默的道路看上去像一条长长的抛光银带，银带上面到处点缀着光影摇曳的暗色蔓藤花纹。闪烁着的汽灯排成一行，迤逦着伸向远方，带有围墙的小房子外面停着一辆孤零零的小马车，车夫睡在里面。他匆匆地朝波特兰广场方向走去，不时地环顾四周，好像担心自己被人跟踪似的。富街的拐角处站着两个男人，他们正在念巨幅广告牌上的一则小广告。一种古怪的好奇感打动了他，他走了过去。当他走近的时候，黑色字母印刷的“谋杀”一词映入了他的眼帘。他吃了一惊，随后脸颊通红。这是一则悬赏广告，悬赏捉拿一个中等个头的男子。这个男子年龄三四十岁，头戴小礼帽，上身穿黑色上衣，下身穿花格长裤，右脸颊上有一道伤疤。他念了一遍又一遍，想知道这个可怜的人会不会被逮住，会如何伤痕累累。也许有一天他自己的名字也会被张贴在伦敦的墙壁上。有一天说不定人们也会对他的脑袋进行悬赏。

这个想法吓得他直犯恶心。他转过身，匆匆地走进了夜幕。

他几乎不知道自己走到了哪里，模糊记得自己穿过了一片迷宫似的肮脏的房屋区。他发现自己最后到了皮卡迪利广场的时候，已经天光大亮。他朝贝尔格雷夫广场方向散步回家，在路上遇到了那些前往考文特花园的大马车。那些穿着白色工作服的车夫晒黑的脸庞喜气洋洋，头发卷曲蓬乱，大步跨进，毅然前行，鞭子甩得啪啪直响，不时地相互打声招呼。一匹高大的灰马领头，走在一个戴着铃铛的马队前面。一个胖乎乎的小男孩坐在灰马背上，破旧的帽子上插着一束报春花，小手紧紧地抓住马鬃，哈哈大笑着。大堆大堆的蔬菜看上去犹如一堆翡翠，朝着早晨的天空，被奇异的玫瑰那粉红色的花瓣包裹着。亚瑟勋爵觉得好奇，受到了影响，却说不清什么原因。黎明的精致之美似乎有一种让他说不出的伤感，让他想起了所有以美丽开局、以风暴结尾的日子。这些乡下人声音粗犷而愉快，对一切满不在乎，他们看到的是多么奇怪的伦敦！是一座摆脱了黑夜的罪恶和白昼的烟雾的伦敦，是一座死气沉沉的幽灵般的城市，是一座坟墓似的荒城！他不知道他们想的是什么，他们知不知道它的辉煌和耻辱，知不知道它火红色的极度欢乐，知不知道它可怕的饥饿，知不知道它从早到晚成就和毁灭的一切。这里对他们来说也许只是一个集市，他们把自己的水果带到这里来卖，他们至多在这里逗留几个小时，接着离开依旧沉默的街道，离开还在睡梦中的房子。他们走过去的时候，他望着他们，这给他带来了快乐。尽管他们粗鲁，穿着沉重的平头钉鞋，步态笨拙，但他们随身带来了一点儿阿卡迪亚[11]的味道。他觉得，他们跟大自然生活在一起，大自然教会了他们平和。他羡慕他们所不自知的一切。

他到达贝尔格雷夫广场的时候，天空呈淡蓝色，鸟儿们开始在花园里鸣啭起来。





第三章


亚瑟勋爵醒来的时候，已是十二点钟了，正午的阳光透过他房间的象牙丝绸窗帘溪水般流淌进来。他站起来，望着窗外。热气雾蒙蒙地笼罩在城市上空，房子的屋顶好似暗淡的白银。在下面广场忽隐忽现的绿色中，一些孩子像白蝴蝶一样飞来飞去，人行道上挤满了前往公园的人们。在他看来，生活似乎从来没有这样美好过，邪恶的东西似乎从来没有这样遥远过。

随后，他的仆人用托盘给他送来了一杯热巧克力。喝过后，他拉开桃红色的毛绒厚帘，走进了浴室。光线从屋顶轻轻溜过，穿过透明的玛瑙薄板，大理石浴池里的水像月光石一样一闪一闪的。他匆匆扑进去，让凉水浸湿他的脖颈和头发，然后把脑袋径直沉入水下，好像这样可以抹去某段可耻的回忆所留下的斑点。出来后，他差不多感到平和了。当下精致的物质条件已经主宰了他，就像火对于它的锻造之物，可以为之提纯，也可以毁灭它。

早饭过后，他倒在长沙发上，点了一根香烟。壁炉架上立着西比尔·默顿的大幅照片，照片四周镶着精美的旧式织锦，她还是像他第一次在诺埃尔太太的舞会上见到她时一样。形状优美的小脑袋微微垂向一边，好像细如芦苇的颈项简直难以承受这么多美丽的负担；双唇微启，似乎要唱出动听的曲调；梦幻般的眼睛向外散发出少女式的温柔与纯洁。她穿着柔软而紧身的双绉裙，手拿大叶扇子，看上去犹如一尊人们在塔纳格拉[12]附近的橄榄林里发现的精美小雕像一般。她的一举一动，无不显露出希腊时代的优雅。然而，她并不娇小。她简直拥有完美的身体比例——在当今时代是一件罕见之事，许多女人要么身材臃肿，要么单薄无力。

现在，亚瑟勋爵看着她，充满了因爱而生的怜惜。他觉得，在谋杀罪的厄运悬在头上的时候，娶她入门就像犹大的出卖行为一样，这是博尔吉亚家族[13]做梦也不曾想到的一种罪恶。当他随时可能奉召去执行写在他手上的那个可怕预言的时候，对他们来说还有什么幸福可言呢？命运的手里还握着这个可怕的预言的时候，他们的生活会是什么样子呢？婚期无论如何必须推迟。这一点他完全下定了决心。尽管他爱这个女孩，当他们坐在一起的时候，仅仅触碰一下她的手指，就能使他身体的每一根神经产生强烈的快感，但他依然清晰地认识到了他的职责所在，并充分意识到，他在谋杀发生之前没有权利结婚。这样做之后，他才能跟西比尔·默顿一起站在圣坛前，把他的一生交到她的手里，不再害怕出错。这样做之后，他才能把她抱在怀里，知道她永远不必为他脸红，不必在耻辱中低头。但是，必须首先做完这件事，而且对他们俩来说越早越好。

如果处在他的位置，许多男人会更喜欢得过且过的享乐之日，而不喜欢责任的陡峭高峰。但亚瑟勋爵却是一个本着良心做事的人，难以把快乐置于原则之上。他的爱超越纯粹的激情，对他来说，西比尔是一切美好与高贵的象征。他一度对自己受命做的一切有一种本能的抵触情绪，而这种抵触情绪很快就消失了。他的心告诉他说，这不是一种罪过，而是一种牺牲；他的理智提醒他，没有别的路可走。他必须得在为自己生活和为他人生活之间进行选择，毫无疑问，尽管压在他身上的任务十分艰巨，但他知道他不能让自私取代爱情。我们迟早都会受命对同样的问题做出决定——我们所有人都会被问到同样的问题。对于亚瑟勋爵来说，这个问题出现得更早些——在他的本性被中年的工于算计和玩世不恭破坏之前，或者说在他的心被我们时代的浅薄、普遍的自负腐蚀之前，他对履行自己的职责毫不犹豫。难得的是，他绝不仅仅是梦想家，也不是什么虚无的旁观者。如果是那样的话，他就会像哈姆雷特那样犹豫不决，让优柔寡断损耗自己的决心。不过，他本质上是一个注重实际的人。生活对他意味着行动，而不是思考。他具有最难得的东西——常识。

到这个时候，前一天夜里那些疯狂、混乱的感情已经完全消失了。他回想自己疯狂地走过一条条街道，回想自己强烈的痛苦，几乎有一种羞耻感。他的种种痛苦的确发自内心，使他现在觉得它们不真实。他不知道他为何会如此愚蠢，对无法改变的命运大喊大叫。唯一使他苦恼的问题似乎只是要杀死谁。因为他很清楚，谋杀这件事就像异教世界的宗教一样，既需要祭司，也需要祭品。他不是一个天才，因此没有敌人，实际上他也觉得现在不是发泄私愤的时候，他要履行的使命极其重大和庄严。因此，他在一张便签上列出了一份亲友的名单，经过深思熟虑之后，决定选中克莱门蒂娜·博尚太太。这是一位住在寇松街的可爱老太太，是他自己的远房表姐。他一向十分喜欢克莱门太太，人人都这样叫她，而且因为他成年之后已经继承了拉格比勋爵的所有财产，格外富有，所以她的死亡不会使他获得任何庸俗的金钱利益。实际上，他越考虑这件事，越觉得她似乎正是那个合适的人选，而且感到任何拖延对西比尔都是不公平的，因此决定立刻安排行动。

当然，要做的第一件事就是付清手相师的账务，所以他在窗口附近一张小谢拉顿[14]式样的写字台边开了一张一百零五英镑的支票，装入信封，吩咐仆人把它送到西月街支付赛普蒂默斯·伯杰斯先生的账单。随后，他给马厩打电话要小马车，穿好衣服就走出了门。他离开房间的时候，回头看了一眼西比尔·默顿的照片，并发誓说，无论如何，他绝不会让她知道他在为她做什么，会一直把自我牺牲这个秘密藏在心里。

在去白金汉俱乐部的途中，他在一家花店停下来，给西比尔送去了一篮漂亮的水仙花——可爱的白色花瓣，野雉眼般的鲜艳花冠。到达俱乐部之后，他直奔藏书室，按响了门铃，吩咐侍者给他端来一杯柠檬苏打水，并要找一本有关毒理学的书。他已经完全决定，使用毒药是应对这件棘手的事的最佳手段。对他来说，任何像个人暴力之类的事都令人讨厌至极，况且他绝不想以任何吸引公众注意的方式去杀死克莱门蒂娜太太，因为他讨厌在温德米尔夫人的宴会上被当成名流，也讨厌看到自己的名字出现在报纸庸俗的社会新闻中。他也不得不想到西比尔的父亲和母亲，因为他们是有些古板的人，听到什么丑闻的话，很可能会反对这门婚事。尽管他敢肯定，如果他告诉他们这个案件的全部事实，他们会是第一个欣赏他的动机的人。因此，他有充分的理由决定使用毒药。毒药安全可靠、悄无声息，排除了见到任何痛苦场景的可能性，他像大多数英国人一样，极力避免任何痛苦场景的出现。

然而，他对毒理学一无所知，侍者也似乎只从藏书室里找到了《拉夫指南》和《贝利杂志》。他亲自仔细查看了书架，终于无意中发现了一卷装帧漂亮的《药典》和一本厄斯金的《毒理学》。《毒理学》由马修·里德爵士编写，马修爵士是皇家医师学院院长，也是白金汉资历最老的成员之一，因被错当成别人而入选；一次意外就这样激怒了委员会，所以后来真人现身的时候，他们也一致反对他入选。亚瑟勋爵对这两本书中使用的术语百思不解，开始后悔他在牛津大学的时候没有更加重视经典，这时他在厄斯金的第二卷里发现了一段对乌头碱性质非常完整的叙述，是用相当明了的英文写的。在他看来，这正是他想要的毒药。这种药效果迅速——实际上，几乎是立竿见影——完全没有痛苦，如果服用马修爵士推荐的明胶胶囊，味道也绝不难吃。因此，他在衬衣袖口上记录下一个致命的剂量，把那些书放回原处，然后沿着圣詹姆斯街走到了著名药剂师佩斯特尔和哈姆贝的药店。佩斯特尔先生总是亲自服侍贵族，却对这个指令大为惊讶，毕恭毕敬地喃喃说了一些诊断书必不可少这样的话。但是，亚瑟勋爵对他解释了一番，说他不得不除掉一条大挪威獒，因为它露出了早期狂犬病的迹象，而且已经咬了赶车人的小腿两次。佩斯特尔先生随即点头称赞，说亚瑟勋爵具有了不起的毒理学知识，并马上按照处方配好了药。

亚瑟勋爵把胶囊放进了他在邦德街一个橱窗里看到的一只漂亮的小银糖果盒里，扔掉了佩斯特尔和哈姆贝药店难看的药丸盒，马上驱车赶到了克莱门蒂娜太太家里。

“噢，恶棍先生[15]，”他走进屋里的时候，老太太嚷道，“你怎么这么久都不来看看我呀？”

“我亲爱的克莱门太太，我从来没有一刻属于自己的时间。”亚瑟微笑着说。

“我想，你是说，你整天跟西比尔·默顿小姐四处闲逛，购买雪纺绸，胡说八道？我不明白为什么人们对结婚大惊小怪。在我那个时代，我们做梦也没有想过在公共场所卿卿我我，也不会在私下谈论这个问题。”

“我向你保证，我已经二十四小时没有见过西比尔了，克莱门太太。据我了解，她现在完全属于她的女帽商。”

“当然，这是你来看一个像我这样的丑老婆子的唯一原因。我纳闷你们这些男人为什么都不吸取教训。也曾有人对我痴狂[16]，我在这里是一个风湿病患者，可怜巴巴，戴着假面具，脾气也坏。啊，要不是因为亲爱的詹森太太，要不是她把那些所有她能找到的最蹩脚的法国小说送来给我，我认为自己将度日如年。除了让人缴费之外，医生们根本没用。他们甚至治不好我的心口痛。”

“克莱门太太，我已经给你带来了一个治愈这种病的良方，”亚瑟勋爵神情严肃地说，“这是一件由美国人发明的美妙东西。”

“我认为我不喜欢美国的发明，亚瑟。我敢肯定我不喜欢。我最近看了一些美国小说，它们写得相当荒谬。”

“噢，但这一个没得说，克莱门太太！我向你保证，这是一种完美的疗法。你一定要答应尝试一下。”说着，亚瑟勋爵从口袋里掏出了一个小盒子，递给她。

“嗯，这个盒子非常可爱，亚瑟。这真是一件礼物吗？你真好。这就是神奇的药吗？它看起来像是夹心糖。我要马上试试。”

“天哪！克莱门太太，”亚瑟勋爵一把抓住她的一只手大声说道，“你不能那样做。这是一种顺势疗法药物，如果你没有心口痛却吃了它，它就可能会对你有许多坏处。等你犯病的时候再吃吧。你会对结果大吃一惊。”

“我现在就想吃。”说着，克莱门蒂娜太太对着光线举起小透明胶囊，清澈的乌头碱浮起了泡沫，“我敢肯定它美味可口。事实上，尽管我讨厌医生，但我爱药丸。不过，我会留到下一次犯病的时候吃。”

“那将会是什么时候？”亚瑟勋爵急切地问道，“会很快吗？”

“我希望不是一个星期。我昨天上午就因犯病而不舒服。可谁也不知道。”

“那你月底前肯定会犯病吗，克莱门太太？”

“我害怕这样。可你今天是多么富有同情心，亚瑟！说真的，西比尔对你大有好处。现在你必须离开了，因为我要跟一些非常乏味的人吃饭，他们不愿谈论丑闻，而且我知道，如果现在得不到睡眠，我晚餐时就绝对无法保持清醒。亚瑟，再见，代问西比尔好，非常感谢你送给我美国药。”

“克莱门太太，你不会忘记吃的，对吗？”亚瑟从座位上站起来说。

“我当然不会，你这傻孩子。我觉得你能想到我，是再好不过了，我要是再想要的话，就会写信告诉你。”

亚瑟勋爵兴高采烈地离开了，有一种如释重负的感觉。

那天夜里，他会见了西比尔·默顿。他告诉她，他是如何被突然置于一种可怕的困境，荣誉和责任都不允许他从中退缩。他告诉她，婚期必须暂时推迟，因为直到摆脱可怕的纠葛，他才会成为一个自由人。他恳求她信任他，而不要对将来有任何疑虑。一切都不会有问题，但必须有耐心。

这个情景发生在海德公园默顿先生家的暖房里，亚瑟勋爵像平常一样在那里吃了饭。西比尔好像从来没有这样开心过。一时间，亚瑟勋爵禁不住要扮演起懦夫的角色，想给克莱门蒂娜太太写信要回那个药丸，并让婚姻继续下去，就像世界上没有伯杰斯先生这个人一样。然而，他人性里高尚善良的一面很快就显示了威力，甚至当西比尔扑在他怀里哭泣的时候，他都没有动摇。西比尔的美既撩动了他的感官，也触动了他的良知。他认为，为了几个月的愉快而破坏如此美好的生活，将是一种错误的做法。

他跟西比尔一直待到接近午夜，他安慰她，反过来她又安慰他。第二天一早，他给默顿先生写了一封措辞果决的信，谈了推迟婚姻的必要性之后，就启程去了威尼斯。





第四章


到了威尼斯，他遇到了他的哥哥瑟比顿勋爵，瑟比顿勋爵碰巧从科孚岛[17]坐游艇过来。两个年轻人一起度过了愉快的两个星期。早晨，他们在丽都岛骑马，或者乘坐长长的黑色平底船沿着绿色运河航行；下午，他们通常在游艇上款待游客；晚上，他们在弗洛莱恩餐馆吃饭，在广场享受数不尽的香烟。但不知何故，亚瑟勋爵却高兴不起来。他每天都研究《泰晤士报》上的讣告栏，期待看到克莱门蒂娜太太死亡的通告，但每天他都失望。他开始担心她发生什么意外，而且经常后悔，不应该在她十分渴望去尝试效果的时候阻止其服用乌头碱。尽管西比尔的信充满了爱、信任和柔情，但语气常常十分伤感，有时他总是认为他会跟她永别。

两个星期后，瑟比顿勋爵渐渐厌倦了威尼斯，决定前往拉文那[18]海岸，因为他听说松树园有一个盛大的猎野鸡活动。亚瑟勋爵起先一口拒绝，但他特别喜欢的瑟比顿最后说服他，如果他独自留在丹尼利的话，他将会闷死。于是，十五日早上，他们就出发了，东北风劲吹，大海有些波涛汹涌。这项运动很好，自由的户外生活使亚瑟勋爵的脸颊恢复了颜色，但大约到了二十二日，他渐渐地担心起了克莱门蒂娜太太，因此，尽管瑟比顿一再挽留，他还是乘火车返回了威尼斯。

当他走出平底船踏上旅馆台阶的时候，旅馆老板拿着一捆电报走上前迎接他。亚瑟勋爵一把从老板的手里夺走了电报一一撕开。一切都取得了成功。克莱门蒂娜太太已经在十七日的夜里突然死去了！

他首先想到的是找西比尔，就给她发了一份电报，告诉她自己将立即返回伦敦，随后吩咐贴身男仆给他收拾东西，赶晚上的邮车，付给船夫们的大约是正常费用的五倍，然后脚步轻快、心花怒放地跑到客厅。到了那里，他发现有三封信在等着他。一封是西比尔本人寄来的，充满了同情和慰问。另外两封是他的母亲和克莱门蒂娜太太的律师寄来的。看来当天晚上老太太曾跟公爵夫人共进晚餐，人人都为她的机智风趣而感到愉悦，但她抱怨心口痛，就早早回家去了。第二天早上，有人发现她死在了床上，显然没有遭受任何痛苦。马修·里德爵士立马应召前往，但想必也无能为力，二十二日她要在博尚夏科下葬。去世前几天，她就立下了遗嘱，除了她收藏的微缩型细密画要归她的妹妹玛格丽特·拉福德太太所有，她在寇松街的小房子，以及她所有的家具、个人物品和绘画作品都留给亚瑟勋爵，她的紫水晶项链则归西比尔·默顿。财产没有多大价值，但律师曼斯菲尔德先生十分期望亚瑟勋爵如有可能马上返回，因为还有大量票据需要支付，克莱门蒂娜太太从来不曾有过任何定期账户。

想起克莱门蒂娜太太的亲切关怀，亚瑟勋爵大为感动，觉得伯杰斯先生要大受惩罚。然而，他对西比尔的爱左右了其他所有情绪，那种尽职尽责的意识给了他平和与安慰。到达查令十字街的时候，他感到非常高兴。

默顿一家非常亲切地接待了他，西比尔让他保证，他再也不会让他们之间发生任何事儿，婚期定于六月七日。在他看来，生活似乎再次明媚了起来，过去所有的喜悦又回到了他身边。

然而，有一天，他跟克莱门蒂娜太太的律师和西比尔本人一起去寇松街的房子，焚烧一捆捆褪色的信件，清理一个个放满奇怪垃圾的抽屉时，女孩突然发出了一声小小的欢乐的叫声。

“你发现了什么，西比尔？”亚瑟勋爵从工作中抬起头来，面带微笑地说。

“这个可爱的小银糖果盒，亚瑟。是不是古雅精巧？请把它给我吧！我知道紫水晶不会适合我，得等到我八十多岁才戴。”

这是那个装乌头碱的盒子。

亚瑟勋爵吃了一惊，脸颊上泛起了淡淡的红晕。他几乎已经完全忘记他做了什么。在他看来，鬼使神差，是西比尔第一个提醒他这一点，为了西比尔他曾经历了所有这一切可怕的焦虑。

“当然，你可以拥有它，西比尔。是我亲自把它给了可怜的克莱门太太。”

“噢！谢谢你，亚瑟。夹心糖也是吗？我根本不知道克莱门蒂娜太太喜欢糖果。我还以为她智商多高呢。”

亚瑟勋爵脸色变得惨白，脑海里掠过了一个可怕的想法。

“夹心糖，西比尔？你是什么意思？”他以缓慢、沙哑的声音说。

“里面有一个，仅此而已。看上去已经放了一段时间，落满灰尘，我根本不想吃。这是怎么回事，亚瑟？你的脸色看上去一片惨白！”

亚瑟勋爵冲过房间，一把抓起那个盒子。里面是琥珀色胶囊，还冒着毒泡。克莱门蒂娜太太毕竟已经寿终正寝了！

发现这一点引起的震惊，简直让他难以承受。他把胶囊扔进了火里，绝望地叫了一声，一屁股坐在了沙发上。





第五章


默顿先生对第二次推迟婚期万分痛苦，朱莉娅太太已经为婚礼订购了婚纱，竭尽全力劝说西比尔中断婚约。然而，西比尔深爱她母亲的同时，也已经把自己的整个生命交到了亚瑟勋爵的手里，朱莉娅太太说什么都无法使她动摇信念。至于亚瑟勋爵本人，他花了几天时间才战胜了自己可怕的失望情绪，期间他一度心灰意冷。然而，他出色的常识很快就显示了威力，健全务实的心智没有让他踌躇不前。已经证明毒药完全失败后，炸药或某种其他形式的爆炸物显然也是可以尝试的。

于是，他又看了一遍那份亲友名单，经过慎重考虑后，决定炸掉他的叔叔——奇切斯特的教长。教长学识渊博，特别喜欢时钟，收藏了一批从十五世纪至今的奇妙钟表，在亚瑟勋爵看来，正是教长的这个嗜好给他提供了实施计划的绝佳机会。到哪里购买一个爆炸装置当然是件不容易的事。伦敦工商目录没有给他提供这方面的任何信息，他觉得去苏格兰场[19]也没有多大用处，因为他们似乎总要到爆炸发生后才能知道关于炸药的内情，甚至在那之后也所知寥寥。

突然，他想到了他的朋友鲁瓦洛夫。鲁瓦洛夫是一个具有强烈革命倾向的俄罗斯年轻人，他是冬天在温德米尔夫人的家里遇见这个年轻人的。鲁瓦洛夫伯爵被委派写一本关于彼得大帝生活的书，并已来到英格兰，目的是研究那位沙皇在这个国家做造船木匠时的住所的相关文件，但人们普遍怀疑他是一名无政府主义特工。毫无疑问的是，他出现在伦敦，俄罗斯大使馆对此并不看好。亚瑟勋爵觉得他正是自己要找的那个人，便选了一天早晨驱车前往他在布鲁姆斯伯里的住处，寻求他的建议和帮助。

“那么，你是要认真从事政治吗？”当亚瑟勋爵告诉他此行的目的之时，鲁瓦洛夫伯爵问道。但是，亚瑟勋爵讨厌任何形式的招摇自大，觉得他不得不对他承认自己对社会问题没有丝毫兴趣，只是因为纯粹的家庭问题想要爆炸装置，除了他自己之外，谁也不关心这个问题。

鲁瓦洛夫伯爵惊讶地看了他一会儿，然后看到他相当认真，就在一张纸上写了一个地址，签上自己名字的首写字母，隔着桌子递给了他。

“为了得到这个地址，苏格兰场会给一个大价钱，我亲爱的伙计。”

“他们不会得到的。”亚瑟勋爵朗声笑道。他热情地握过俄罗斯小伙子的手之后跑下楼，仔细查看了那张纸，然后吩咐车夫把车开到苏荷广场。

到了那里，他打发走了车夫，沿着希腊街走，直至一个叫贝尔院的地方。他穿过拱门，发现自己到了一个奇怪的死胡同。一家法国洗衣房显眼地盘踞在路的尽头，晾衣绳织成的紧密的网从房子的一边延伸至另一边，白色亚麻布在晨风中拂动着。他走到尽头，敲响了一间绿色小屋的房门。门一时没有开，院子里的窗口如同一个个模糊的窥探着什么的面孔。之后，一个模样有些粗野的外国人探出头来，用非常蹩脚的英语问他有何贵干。亚瑟勋爵把鲁瓦洛夫伯爵给他的那张纸递了过去。那个人看到那张纸的时候，鞠了一躬，邀请亚瑟勋爵进入一楼一个非常简陋的前厅等待。过了一会儿，那个在英国被称为温克尔科普夫先生的人匆匆走进房间，脖子上围着一块酒迹斑斑的餐巾，左手拿着叉子。

“鲁瓦洛夫伯爵向我介绍了你，”亚瑟勋爵鞠了一躬说，“我想和你就一件事聊几句。我的名字叫史密斯，罗伯特·史密斯先生，我想要你给我提供一座爆炸时钟。”

“亚瑟勋爵，很高兴见到你，”这个和颜悦色的矮个德国人笑着说道，“不要那么惊慌，了解大家是我的职责，我记得有一天晚上在温德米尔夫人的家里见过你。我希望夫人很好。你介意和我一起用早餐吗？有一种非常棒的肉酱，而且我的朋友都好心地说我的莱茵白葡萄酒比他们在德国大使馆得到的都好。”还没有从被认出的惊讶中回过神来，亚瑟勋爵就发现自己坐在了后屋里，正用标有帝国字母组合的淡黄色霍克杯呷着最美味的白葡萄酒，以尽可能最友好的方式跟那个有名的阴谋家聊着天。

“爆炸时钟，”温克尔科普夫先生说，“不是非常容易向外国出口的东西，因为即使成功通过海关，火车时刻表也没个准点，它们通常会在到达目的地之前发生爆炸。但如果你想要一个适合家庭使用的，我这里正好就有一个质量优良的爆炸时钟，保证你会对结果感到满意。我可以问一下这是针对谁的吗？如果是针对警察，或者任何一个跟苏格兰场有关的警察，恐怕我就不能为你做任何事儿了。英国警探的确是我们最好的朋友，拜他们的愚蠢所赐，我们总是可以想做什么就做什么。我可不想做任何针对他们的事儿。”

“我向你保证，”亚瑟勋爵说，“这跟警察没有任何关系。实际上，时钟是针对奇切斯特教长的。”

“天哪！我原来不知道你对宗教有如此强烈的感情，亚瑟勋爵。如今这样的年轻人寥寥无几。”

“温克尔科普夫先生，恐怕你高估我了，”亚瑟勋爵红着脸说，“事实上，我对神学一无所知。”

“那么，这是一件纯私人的事情吗？”

“是纯私人的。”

温克尔科普夫先生耸了耸肩，离开了房间，几分钟后带回来一颗一便士大小、圆蛋糕似的炸弹，是一座漂亮的法国小时钟，时钟顶端是自由女神镀金铜像，铜像脚下踩着象征独裁的九头蛇。

亚瑟勋爵看到它，脸上露出了笑容。“这正是我想要的东西，”他喊道，“现在告诉我它如何爆炸。”

“啊！这是我的秘密，”温克尔科普夫先生用一种理所当然的骄傲神情注视着他的发明答道，“告诉我，你希望它什么时候爆炸，我会将机器设置到那个时刻。”

“好吧，今天是星期二，如果你能马上寄出去——”

“那不可能，我手头上还有许多莫斯科朋友委托的重要工作。不过，也许我明天能把它寄出。”

“噢，如果明天夜里或星期四早上送到，时间就会绰绰有余！”亚瑟勋爵礼貌地说，“对于爆炸的那个时刻，定在星期五中午正好。教长总是那个时刻在家。”

“星期五中午。”温克尔科普夫先生重复道，壁炉旁边的书桌上放着一个大账簿，他把大意记了下来。

“现在，”亚瑟勋爵一边说，一边从座位上站了起来，“请告诉我该付你多少钱。”

“亚瑟勋爵，这样的区区小事，我本不愿收任何费用。炸药共计六先令七便士，时钟三英镑十先令，运费大约五先令。我非常高兴帮助鲁瓦洛夫伯爵的任何朋友。”

“可是，还有给你添的麻烦，温克尔科普夫先生？”

“噢，那没什么！这是我的荣幸。我不为金钱工作，完全是为自己的手艺而活。”

亚瑟勋爵在桌子上放下四英镑两先令六便士，对那位矮个子德国人的帮助表示感谢，成功地谢绝了下星期六在牛肉茶会上会见一些无政府主义者的邀请，离开后便去了海德公园。

随后的两天里，他处在一种极度亢奋的状态中。星期五中午十二点钟，他驱车前往白金汉俱乐部，等候消息传来。整个下午，那个缺乏热情的大厅门房不停地张贴着来自全国各地的电报，这些电报提供赛马结果、离婚诉讼判决、天气状况等等，而自动收报机嘀嘀嗒嗒地打印着一些乏味的琐事，说的是下议院的一次通宵会议，以及证券交易上的一次小小恐慌。下午四点钟，晚报送了进来，亚瑟勋爵拿着《蓓尔美尔公报》《圣詹姆斯公报》《环球报》和《回声报》钻进了藏书室。此举让古德柴尔德上校大为光火，上校想读那天上午他在市长大厦的演讲报告，演讲的主题是南非的传教工作，每个省安排黑人主教的可取性，以及出于某种原因对《新闻晚报》的严词抨击。然而，没有一家报纸提及奇切斯特，亚瑟勋爵觉得他的尝试一定是失败了。这对他是一个可怕的打击，一时间他十分气馁。第二天，温克尔科普夫先生去见他，心情复杂，充满歉意，并表示愿意提供给他另一座时钟，或者以成本价卖给他一盒硝基甘油炸弹。但是，他已经对炸药失去了所有信心。温克尔科普夫先生本人承认，如今的一切东西都十分伪劣，就连真正的炸药也几乎难以买到。然而，尽管那位矮个子德国人认为一定是机器出了问题，但他又不无希望地说着时钟仍有可能爆炸，举例说他曾给位于敖德萨的军事长官寄过气压表，尽管时间定在十天内爆炸，但差不多三个月都没有爆炸。的确，它真正爆炸的时候，只是成功地把一个女佣炸成了碎片，那个军事长官六个星期前就已经出城走了，但这至少表明，炸药作为一种破坏力量，在机械的控制下仍是一种有些不守时却又强大的力量。德国人的反省让亚瑟勋爵得到了一点儿安慰，但即便如此，他也是注定要失望的——两天后，就在他上楼时公爵夫人把他叫到了她的会客室，给他看了一封她刚收到的从教长宅邸寄来的信。

“简写的信非常迷人，”公爵夫人说，“你必须好好读读她的最后一封。这完全像穆迪寄给我们的小说一样出色。”

亚瑟勋爵一把从她的手里夺过那封信。信的内容如下：





最亲爱的姑妈：

非常感谢你为多加会[20]送来了法兰绒和多纹棉布。我完全同意你的看法，他们想穿漂亮的东西是无稽之谈，但如今每个人都如此激进，没有信仰，很难让他们明白他们不应该尝试穿得像上等人一样。我确信我不知道将来会发生什么。正如爸爸经常在他的布道里所说，我们生活在一个没有信仰的时代。

一个不明身份的仰慕者上星期四寄给爸爸一座时钟，我们开心极了。时钟是装在木箱里从伦敦寄来的，运费已付。爸爸觉得，这一定是读过他非凡的布道词《放纵是自由吗？》的某个人寄来的，因为时钟顶部是一个女人的雕像，爸爸说她的头上是自由之冠。我自己认为它很不合适，但爸爸说这具有历史意义，所以我想这没什么问题。帕克打开箱子，爸爸把它放在书房里的壁炉台上。星期五上午，我们都坐在那里，正当时钟敲响十二下的时候，我们听到了一阵呼呼声，只见一小股烟雾从雕像底座升起，自由女神雕像摔了下来，在炉围上摔断了鼻梁！玛丽亚相当惊慌，但看上去是如此可笑，我和詹姆斯都突然大笑了起来，连爸爸也被逗乐了。仔细查看之后，我们发现这是一座特别的闹钟。如果你将它设置到一个特定时间，放一些火药，在小锤子下面放上引信，你想要它什么时候响它就什么时候响。爸爸说不要把它留在书房，因为它发出了响声，雷吉就把它拿到了教室。它一整天都没什么响动，只有一阵阵小小的爆炸声。你觉得亚瑟会想要一个作为结婚礼物吗？我想这种闹钟在伦敦相当流行。爸爸说这种闹钟很棒，它表明自由不可能持久，而是一定会倒下。爸爸说自由是在法国大革命时期发明的。听起来是多么可怕！

我现在得去多加会，要在那里为她们读你那封极有启发性的信件。亲爱的姑妈，你的想法是如此明智，她们在那个阶层的生活中就应该穿些看上去不一样的衣服。我必须说，当今生和来世还有那么多更重要的事儿要做的时候，她们对着装的焦虑真是荒唐可笑。我很高兴收到你送来的花府绸衣服，看上去很合身，蕾丝也没有破。我穿着你星期三在主教家好心送给我的黄绸缎的衣服，觉得它看上去不错。你觉得再缝上蝴蝶结怎么样？詹宁斯说现在每个人都打蝴蝶结，衬裙应该饰有褶边。雷吉说闹钟刚刚又爆炸了一次，而爸爸已经吩咐他把它送到了马厩。我觉得爸爸不像当初那样喜欢它了，不过有人送给他这样一个漂亮精巧的玩具，他还是倍感荣幸。这表明人们读他的布道，并得益于此。

爸爸送上他的爱，詹姆斯、雷吉和玛丽亚也一同问好，希望塞西尔姑父的痛风好转，相信我，亲爱的姑妈。

永远爱你的侄女

简·珀西





附言：请告诉我有关蝴蝶结的情况。詹宁斯坚持认为它们是眼下的时尚。

奇切斯特教长宅邸

五月二十七日





亚瑟勋爵看信的时候表情非常严肃，怏怏不乐，公爵夫人哈哈大笑起来。

“我亲爱的亚瑟，”她大声说道，“我永远不会再给你看一个年轻太太的信了！可是，关于这种闹钟我想要说什么呢？我认为这是一个一流的发明，我自己也想要一个。”

“我可不太看好。”亚瑟勋爵苦笑着说。亲吻他的母亲后，他就离开了房间。

上楼后，他扑倒在沙发上，眼里充满了泪水。他已经尽力去实施这起谋杀，但两次都失败了，而且都不是他自己的过错。他曾试图尽职尽责，但好像命运自己变成了叛徒。好心好意，却竹篮打水一场空；试图完美，却徒劳无益，他感到压抑。或许，还是彻底取消婚约更好。诚然，西比尔将会痛苦，但痛苦并不能真正损伤她如此高贵的天性。至于他自己，那又有什么关系呢？总有某种可以让男人赴死的战争，某种可以让男人献身的事业，生命对他没有快乐可言，所以对于死亡他也没有任何恐惧。让命运女神解决他的厄运吧。他不会再主动帮她。

七点半钟，他穿好衣服，下楼去俱乐部。瑟比顿在那里跟一群小伙子聚会，他不得不跟他们一起吃饭。他们琐碎的谈话和无聊的玩笑没有引起他的兴趣。为了脱身，咖啡端上来时他就说有一个约会，借口离开了他们。当他走出俱乐部的时候，大厅门房递给他一封信。这是温克尔科普夫先生寄来的，请他第二天晚上过去看一把炸弹伞，那把伞一打开就会爆炸。这是最新的发明，刚刚从日内瓦发货抵达。他把信撕成了碎片。他已经打定了主意，不再尝试任何别的实验。随后，他散步到泰晤士河堤岸，在河边坐了几个小时。月亮从黄褐色的鬃毛似的云团间露出来，就像是狮子的眼睛，无数的星星在天空中闪耀，仿佛金粉洒在紫色的圆顶上。偶尔有一只驳船晃荡着驶过，进入浑浊的溪流，顺流漂去。鸣笛的火车奔过大桥后，铁路信号灯由绿色变成了猩红色。过了一段时间，十二点的钟声从威斯敏斯特高高的塔楼上隆隆传来，钟声每响一下，夜空似乎就颤抖一次。随后，铁路灯熄灭，留下一盏孤灯像一颗大红宝石在巨大的桅杆上闪闪发亮，城市的喧闹声变得越来越微弱。

到了两点钟，他站起来，朝黑衣修士桥走去。一切看上去都是如此虚幻！多么像一场奇怪的梦啊！河对岸的房子脱离了夜晚的黑暗。人们会说，银光和阴影已经重新塑造了世界。圣保罗教堂的巨大圆顶像气泡一样在朦胧的夜色中若隐若现。

他走近克娄巴特拉方尖碑[21]的时候，看到一个男人俯身在栏杆上面。他走得越来越近，那个男人抬起头，汽灯光完全照落在了他的脸上。

这是手相师伯杰斯先生！谁也不会认错那张肥胖松弛的脸庞、金丝眼镜、惨白的微笑和充满欲望的嘴唇。

亚瑟勋爵停住了脚步。一个绝妙的主意闪过他的脑海。他悄悄地绕到伯杰斯先生身后，一把抓住他的双腿，把他抛进了泰晤士河。这时传来了粗鲁的咒骂声和扑通的溅水声，随后万籁俱寂。亚瑟勋爵焦急地望过去，只见手相师的一顶高帽在月光下的水涡里打着转。过了一段时间，它也沉没了，再不见伯杰斯先生的一丝痕迹。他一度认为自己又看见了那个笨拙丑陋的巨大身影从大桥的楼梯处突然冒了出来，一种可怕的失败感向他袭来，但结果证明那原来仅仅是一道云影，当月亮从云后面钻出来的时候，它就消失了。最后，他似乎才意识到了命运的判决，如释重负地呼了口气，顺口说出了西比尔的名字。

“你扔下了什么东西，先生？”他身后一个声音突然说道。

他转过身，看到了一位手提靶心灯笼的警察。

“并不是什么重要的东西，警官。”他一边微笑着回答，一边招呼一辆路过的双座马车，然后跳了进去，吩咐车夫前往贝尔格雷夫广场。

接下来的几天，他时而充满希望，时而感到恐惧。有些时候，他简直盼望伯杰斯先生走进房间，但在其他时候，他觉得命运不能对他这么不公平。他两次前往位于西月街的手相师的办公室，都无法让自己按响门铃。他既渴望确定，又害怕确定。

最后，真相大白。他坐在俱乐部抽烟室一边喝茶，一边有些无聊地听着索比顿讲述欢乐剧院最近的滑稽歌曲，这时服务员拿着晚报走了进来。他拿起《圣詹姆斯公报》，无精打采地翻看起来，这时下面这个奇怪的标题引起了他的注意：





手相师的自杀





他兴奋得脸色苍白，开始看了起来。这段内容如下：





昨天早上七点钟，著名手相师塞普蒂默斯·R．伯杰斯先生的尸体被冲到了格林尼治镇的河岸上，就在航船酒店的前面。这位不幸的先生之前已经失踪了几天，手相界都为他的安全忧心忡忡。据推测，他是因积劳成疾在突发性精神错乱的影响下而自杀，验尸陪审团今天下午公布了裁定结果。伯杰斯先生刚刚完成了一篇关于手的主题详论，不久将会发表，到时一定将备受关注。死者六十五岁，似乎没有留下任何亲属。





亚瑟勋爵手里还拿着那张报纸就冲出了俱乐部，让大厅门房大为惊讶，门房试图拦住他，但没有拦住。亚瑟勋爵马上乘车去了公园小巷。西比尔从窗户看见了他，情况向她表明他带来了好消息。她跑下来迎接他，看到他的脸，她知道一切都很好。

“我亲爱的西比尔，”亚瑟勋爵嚷道，“我们明天结婚吧！”

“你这个傻小子！哎呀，连蛋糕都还没有订呢！”西比尔眼泪汪汪地笑道。





第六章


大约三个星期后，婚礼举行，圣彼得教堂挤满了上流人物。证婚词是由奇切斯特教长以极其感人的方式诵读的。人们都一致认为，他们从来没有见过一对比新郎新娘还要漂亮的夫妇。不过，他们不仅仅是漂亮——也非常幸福。亚瑟勋爵一刻也没有后悔过他为了西比尔而遭受的一切，而她，也献给了他一个女人可以给男人的最好的东西——爱慕、温柔以及爱情。对他们来说，浪漫并没有被现实扼杀。他们总是感到朝气蓬勃。

几年后，当两个漂亮的孩子生下来的时候，温德米尔夫人过来参观奥尔顿修道院——一个可爱的老地方，是公爵送给儿子的结婚礼物。一天下午，她跟亚瑟太太坐在花园里的欧椴树下，望着小男孩和小女孩像闪耀着的阳光般在玫瑰小路上追逐玩闹时，她突然握住了女主人的手，说道：“你幸福吗，西比尔？”

“亲爱的温德米尔夫人，我当然幸福。你不是吗？”

“我没有时间幸福，西比尔。我总是喜欢最后一个被介绍给我的人。不过，一般来说，一旦认识了他们，我又会渐渐感到厌倦。”

“你的狮子们满足不了你吗，温德米尔夫人？”

“哎呀，不！狮子们只在一个季节有好处。鬣毛一剪断，它们就是现存最迟钝的生物。此外，如果你真的对它们好的话，它们就会表现得非常糟糕。你还记得那个可怕的伯杰斯先生吗？他是一个可恶的骗子。当然，我根本不介意，甚至当他想借钱的时候，我都原谅了他，但我不能忍受他对我示爱。他真的已经使我讨厌手相术了。我现在爱好心灵感应。这有趣多了。”

“温德米尔夫人，你在这里千万不能提及反对手相术的话，这是亚瑟不喜欢人们打趣的唯一话题。我向你保证他对这件事非常认真。”

“你不是要说他相信手相术吧，西比尔？”

“温德米尔夫人，问他吧，他来了。”说着，亚瑟勋爵手里拿着一大束黄玫瑰，向花园走来，他的两个孩子正围着他跳舞。

“亚瑟勋爵？”

“是的，温德米尔夫人。”

“你不是说你相信手相术吧？”

“我当然相信。”年轻人微笑着说。

“可为什么？”

“因为我把一生所有的幸福都归功于它。”他喃喃说道，靠在了一把柳条椅上。

“我亲爱的亚瑟勋爵，你把什么归功于它呢？”

“西比尔。”他把玫瑰递给妻子，望着她紫罗兰色的眼睛答道。

“胡说什么！”温德米尔夫人嚷道，“我这辈子还从来没有听过这样的胡话呢。”

坎特维尔的幽灵

——一篇万物有灵浪漫传奇


第一章


当美国公使海勒姆·B．奥蒂斯先生买下坎特维尔猎场的时候，人人都对他说，他是在做一件愚不可及的事儿，因为毫无疑问这个地方闹鬼。实际上，坎特维尔勋爵本人是一个最一丝不苟的人，他已经感到自己有责任在洽谈条件的时候向奥蒂斯先生提及这个事实。

“自从我的姑婆博尔顿公爵老夫人受到惊吓并发生痉挛以来，我们自己都不愿住在这个地方。”坎特维尔勋爵说，“当时，她正在穿衣服准备吃饭，两只骷髅手搭在了她的肩上，她受到了惊吓，从此以后再没有恢复过来。奥蒂斯先生，我觉得必须告诉你，我好几个健在的家人都看见过那个幽灵，教区的牧师奥古斯都·丹皮尔也看见过，他是剑桥大学国王学院的研究员。公爵夫人发生那次不幸的意外之后，比较年轻的仆人们不再愿跟我们待在一起，坎特维尔夫人夜里常常睡不踏实，因为走廊和书房总是传来神秘的声音。”

“勋爵大人，”公使回答说，“我会给家具和幽灵估值。我来自一个现代化的国家，我们在那里拥有的一切，金钱都可以买到。我们所有朝气蓬勃的小伙子正把旧世界涂成红色，夺去你们最出色的女演员和女主角。我认为，如果欧洲有像幽灵这样的东西，我们得在家尽快见到它，要么把它带到我们国家的公立博物馆，要么带它做公路巡演。”

“我担心幽灵存在，”坎特维尔勋爵微笑着说，“不过它可能不会接受你富有魄力的剧团经理的提议。众所周知，从一五八四年以来，它已经闻名三百年了，实际上我的每个家庭成员在世时都见过它。”

“那么，家庭医生也是这样，坎特维尔勋爵。可是，先生，没有幽灵这样的东西，我猜自然规律是不会为英国贵族破例的。”

“你们在美国当然是非常自然的，”坎特维尔勋爵回答，没有完全明白奥蒂斯先生的最后一句话，“如果你不介意家里有鬼，那就没事儿。只是你必须记住我警告过你。”

这之后几个星期，这桩买卖最后完成，公使和他的家人在一季结束的时候迁去了坎特维尔猎场。奥蒂斯太太从前是第五十三街西的卢克丽霞·R．塔潘小姐，曾是纽约大名鼎鼎的美女，现在是一位非常标致的中年女人，眼睛漂亮，五官端正。许多美国太太离开故土的时候会化一种类似长期健康欠佳的妆容，认为这是一种欧洲的文雅，但奥蒂斯太太从来没有犯过这种错误。她有一副出色的体格，事实上充满令人惊奇的活力。实际上，在许多方面，她完全英国化，极好地证明了当今的我们除了语言外，与美国并无十分不同。他们的长子名叫华盛顿，这是他的父母亲一时爱国情绪高涨给他起的，一直让他愤恨不平。他是一个颇为英俊的金发小伙子，代表美国在纽波特娱乐场连续三个赛季领先德国人，即使在伦敦，他也因出色的舞技而赫赫有名。对栀子花和贵族爵位的痴迷是他唯一的不足，在其他方面他格外明智。弗吉尼娅·E．奥蒂斯小姐是一个十五岁的小姑娘，像小鹿一样轻盈可爱，蓝蓝的大眼睛漂亮直率。她是一个了不起的亚马孙女战士[1]，曾经骑着自己的小马跟老比尔顿勋爵比赛，绕着公园跑了两圈，在阿基里斯[2]雕像的前面，以一个半马身长的优势取胜；柴郡的年轻公爵大喜过望，当场向她求婚，却被他的监护人当天夜里送回伊顿公学，他顿时泪如泉涌。弗吉尼娅之后是双胞胎兄弟，他们通常被称为“星条旗”，因为他们总是被打得鼻青脸肿。他们是讨人喜欢的男孩，除了可敬的公使之外，他们是家里仅有的纯正共和党人。

因为坎特维尔猎场距离最近的火车站阿斯科特七英里，所以奥蒂斯先生就打电报要了一辆轻便马车来接他们，他们兴致勃勃地开始坐车兜风。这是一个宜人的七月黄昏，空气中弥漫着松木的清香。他们不时地听到林鸽静思默想时自己发出的悦耳的声音，或看到飒飒作响的蕨草深处野鸡光洁的胸脯。他们经过的时候，小松鼠在山毛榉树上凝视着他们；兔子翘着白尾巴穿过草丛，跃过长满青苔的圆丘，飞掠而去。然而，当他们进入坎特维尔猎场林荫道的时候，天空突然变得阴云密布，一种奇异的寂静托住了大气，一大群白嘴鸦静静地飞过他们的头顶，还没等他们到达房子，硕大的雨点就已经陆续落了下来。

站在台阶上迎接他们的是一位老太太，只见她身穿整洁的黑色绸衣，头戴白色帽子，腰系围裙。这是女管家乌姆妮太太，在坎特维尔夫人的殷切恳求下，奥蒂斯夫人已经同意继续保留她以前的职位。他们下车的时候，她对他们每人都行了屈膝礼，并以一种老派的方式说道：“我对你们莅临坎特维尔猎场表示欢迎。”他们跟着她穿过精美的都铎风格[3]的大厅，走进书房。那是一个狭长低矮的房间，墙上镶着黑橡木壁板，房间尽头是一个彩色玻璃大窗。在这里，茶已经为他们摆好，他们脱下外套后坐下来，开始环顾四周，这时乌姆妮太太伺候着他们。

突然，奥蒂斯太太看见了壁炉旁边地板上的一个暗红色斑点，但完全没有意识到那个斑点真正意味着什么，便对乌姆妮太太说：“恐怕是什么东西溅在了那里。”

“是的，夫人，”老管家用低沉的声音回答说，“血溅在了那块地方。”

“真讨厌，”奥蒂斯夫人嚷道，“我根本不关心客厅里的血迹。必须马上除去。”

老太太微微一笑，以同样低沉而神秘的声音回答说：“这是艾莉诺·德·坎特维尔夫人的血，一五七五年她正是在那个地方被自己的丈夫西蒙·德·坎特维尔爵士谋杀了。西蒙爵士比她多活了九年，然后在非常神秘的情况下突然消失了。他的尸体一直没有找到，但他罪恶的灵魂依旧在猎场出没。那些血迹备受游客及其他客人的赞美，而且也难以除掉。”

“胡说，”华盛顿·奥蒂斯嚷道，“平克顿出品的冠军牌去污剂和完美牌洗涤剂能立刻把它除掉。”还没等吓坏了的女管家阻拦，他就已经跪到了地上，用看上去像黑色化妆品的小棒飞快地擦起了地板。不一会儿，血迹就不见了踪影。

“我就知道平克顿能做到这一点。”他环顾着啧啧称赞的家人扬扬得意地大声说道，但他刚说完这些话，一道可怕的闪电瞬时照亮了昏暗的房间，一声吓人的炸雷惊得他们都跳了起来，乌姆妮太太晕倒在地。

“多么怪异的气候！”美国公使点起方头长雪茄平静地说，“我想这个古老国家的人口太多了，这样没法让人人都有个像样的天气。我一直认为向外移民是英格兰唯一的出路。”

“我亲爱的海勒姆，”奥蒂斯夫人叫道，“我们能为一个晕倒的女人做些什么呢？”

“收她损失赔偿费，”公使回答说，“之后她就不会晕倒了。”不一会儿，乌姆妮太太的确醒了过来。然而，毫无疑问，她特别难过，却仍旧固执地正告着奥蒂斯先生要提防房子会遇到的麻烦。

“先生，我亲眼见到过一些东西，”她说，“那能使任何一个基督徒都头发倒竖，这里发生的那些可怕的事情，让我好多好多个夜晚都合不上眼。”但是，奥蒂斯先生和他的妻子友好地向这个实诚的人保证说他们不怕鬼，接着，在祈求上帝保佑新主人夫妇，并达成涨工资的协议之后，老管家就蹒跚着去了她自己的房间。





第二章


狂风暴雨肆虐了整整一夜，但没有发生特别值得注意的事儿。然而，次日早上他们下来吃早饭的时候，发现可怕的血迹又一次出现在了地板上。“我认为，这不可能是完美牌洗涤剂的过错，”华盛顿说，“因为我曾经用它擦净过所有的东西。那一定是幽灵干的。”接着，他第二次擦掉了血迹，第二天早上血迹却再次出现。尽管书房夜里由奥蒂斯先生本人锁上，钥匙也被拿上了楼，但第三天早晨它还是在那里。全家人现在对此都非常感兴趣；奥蒂斯先生开始怀疑他曾经在否定幽灵存在这个问题上过于武断，奥蒂斯太太表示有加入通灵会的打算，华盛顿准备了一封给迈尔斯和波德莫尔先生的长信，主题是跟犯罪有关的血迹永久性这个问题。那天夜里，所有对幽灵是否客观存在的疑虑永远消除了。

这一天和煦温暖。在凉爽的夜晚，全家人坐车出去兜风。他们直到九点钟才回家，吃了一顿简便的晚饭。常常，人们在看到通灵现象之前都会表现出一种接受此种现象的期待，而今晚的谈话根本没有涉及幽灵，所以连产生这种期待的基本条件都没有。后来，我从奥蒂斯先生那里了解到，他们当晚讨论的话题仅仅是有修养的上层美国人的普通对话：比如范妮·达文波特小姐比莎拉·伯恩哈特演得好多了，比如即使在英国最好的人家也难以得到嫩玉米、荞麦饼和玉米粥，比如波士顿对培养世界精神的重要性，比如铁路旅行中行李检查系统的优点，比如跟伦敦拉长的音调相比纽约口音更加甜美。根本没有提到超自然现象，也没有任何一个字与西蒙·德·坎特维尔爵士有所关联。十一点钟，家人都去睡觉了，到十一点半所有的灯都熄灭了。过了一段时间后，奥蒂斯先生被走廊里的一个奇怪的声音惊醒了。听上去像是金属的叮当声，而且似乎越来越近。他立刻起床，划亮一根火柴，看了看时间。正是一点钟。他相当平静，摸了摸自己的脉搏，根本没有发烧的迹象。奇怪的声音还在继续，而且伴随着奇怪的声音，他清晰地听到了脚步声。他穿上拖鞋，从梳妆盒里拿出一个长方体小药瓶，打开了门。就在他的面前，在暗淡的月光下，他看到了一位相貌可怕的老人。老人的眼睛像火红的燃煤一般，灰色的长发乱蓬蓬打着卷儿披在肩上，衣服款式古老，又脏又破，手腕和脚踝上戴着沉重而又锈迹斑斑的手铐和脚镣。

“我亲爱的先生，”奥蒂斯先生说，“我真的必须得让你给那些枷锁上点油了，为此给你带来了一小瓶坦慕尼旭日牌润滑油。据说，这东西用一次就会完全起效，包装纸上有好几条这样的客户评价，都是出自我们当地一些最著名的牧师。我将把它留给你，放在这卧室的蜡烛旁边，你要是需要，我非常乐意提供更多给你。”说完这些话，美国公使把瓶子放在一张大理石桌子上，关上门，就去休息了。

一时间，坎特维尔的幽灵站在那里一动不动，自然是怒不可遏。随后，他狠狠地把瓶子摔在锃亮的地板上，顺着走廊逃去，嘴里发出空洞的呻吟声，眼睛里闪出一道瘆人的可怕绿光。然而，就在他逃到橡木大楼梯顶部的时候，一扇门猛地被推开了，只见两个白袍小人出现了，一只大枕头从他的头边飕地飞过！显然刻不容缓，因此他匆匆采用四维空间作为逃生途径，穿过护墙板不见了踪影，房子完全静了下来。

他逃到左侧的一间小密室的时候，倚着一道月光，喘了口气，开始思考自己的处境。在三百年间从未中断的辉煌生涯中，他从来没有受到过如此严重的侮辱。他想起了公爵老夫人，她穿着蕾丝衣服、戴着钻石站在镜子前面的时候，他已经把她吓得发生了痉挛；他想起了四个女佣，当他仅仅透过其中一间备用卧室的窗帘朝她们咧开嘴笑的时候，她们突然歇斯底里地发作了起来；他想起了教区牧师，一天深夜，牧师从书房出来的时候吹灭了蜡烛，从那以后他便只能由威廉爵士照看，因为他已经完全成了一个神经紊乱的牺牲品；他还想起了特雷莫伊拉克老夫人，她一天早晨醒来的时候看到一个骷髅坐在炉边的扶手椅里看她的日记，就脑膜炎发作，在床上躺了六个星期，康复后皈依了教会，断绝了她与臭名昭著的怀疑论者伏尔泰[4]先生的来往。他记得那个可怕的夜晚，有人发现邪恶的坎特维尔勋爵在更衣室里窒息，半张方块J卡在了他的喉咙中间，而且就在死之前，坎特维尔承认，他就是通过这张牌在克罗克福德家里骗了查尔斯·詹姆斯·福克斯五万英镑，并发誓说那个幽灵逼迫他吞下了那张牌。他所有的伟大成就又回到了他的脑海里。男管家之所以在食品储藏室开枪自杀，是因为他看到了一只绿手在敲窗玻璃；对美丽的斯塔特菲尔德夫人来说，为了隐藏烙在白皙皮肤上的五个手指印，她总是不得不围着黑色天鹅绒带子，最后在国王步道尽头的鲤鱼塘里淹死了自己。他带着真正艺术家的热情与自负，一一回顾着自己最著名的表演，回想起自己最后一次扮演“红色鲁宾，即被勒死的宝贝”，回想起他初次登台演出“贝克斯利沼地的吸血鬼冈特·基比恩”，回想起六月的一个可爱的傍晚他只是用自己的骨头在草坪网球场地上玩九柱戏[5]就引起的轰动场面，他不由得暗自苦笑了一下。经过这一切之后，一些卑鄙的现代美国人居然要送给他旭日牌润滑油，还要拿枕头砸向他的脑袋！这是完全难以忍受的。此外，历史上没有任何幽灵曾被这样对待过。因此，他决心报仇雪恨，直到天亮都保持着一个不变的陷入沉思的姿势。





第三章


第二天早上，奥蒂斯一家吃早餐时见面的时候，对于幽灵这个话题进行了详细的讨论。美国公使发现自己的礼物没有被接受自然有点儿恼火。“我并不希望，”他说，“去对那个幽灵进行任何人身伤害。我必须说，他在家里待的时间并不长，我认为朝他扔枕头是根本不礼貌的。”——尽管这话说得非常公正，但我很抱歉地说，这对双胞胎兄弟却爆发出了一阵阵大笑。“另一方面，”他继续说道，“如果他真的拒绝使用旭日牌润滑油，我们就不得不去掉他身上的铁链。卧室外面发出那么大的噪音，是完全不可能睡觉的。”

然而，在一个星期剩下的时间里，他们没有受到干扰，引起注意的唯一的东西就是书房地板上不断更新的血迹。这当然非常奇怪，因为夜里房门总是由奥蒂斯先生锁上的，窗户也已经被严严实实地插好。另外，血迹变色龙般的色彩也引起了纷纷议论。有些早晨，血迹是暗红色的（几乎是印度红），接着是朱红色，之后是浓紫色；有一次，按照自由美国归正圣公会教堂的简单仪式，他们下楼进行家庭祈祷，发现血迹是鲜艳的翠绿色。这万花筒似的种种变化自然让一家人兴致勃勃，每天晚上都要对这一主题频频下赌。唯一没有参与这个游戏的人是小弗吉尼娅，由于某种无法解释的原因，她一见到血迹就痛苦万分，血迹呈翠绿色的早晨她差点儿痛哭起来。

幽灵第二次出现是在星期天夜里。他们上床睡觉后不久，突然被大厅里一阵可怕的撞击声吓得惊慌失措。他们冲下楼来，发现一件大盔甲已经从支架上脱离开来，掉在了石地板上，与此同时，坎特维尔的幽灵坐在高背椅上，表情极其痛苦地揉着自己的膝盖。双胞胎随身带着自己的玩具枪，马上朝他开了两枪，打得很准，这只有通过长期细致地瞄准写作老师进行训练才能做到，而美国公使则用左轮手枪瞄准了他，按照加州的规矩，要求他举起双手！幽灵发出了一声疯狂而愤怒的尖叫，跳将起来，像雾一般扫过他们，路过的时候刮灭了华盛顿·奥蒂斯的蜡烛，因此把他们都留在了一片黑暗当中。到达楼梯顶部的时候，他恢复了过来，决定发出他赫赫有名的恶魔般的笑声。这一招，他用过不止一次，发现特别有用。据说，这笑声曾经一夜之间把雷克尔勋爵的假发变成了灰色，使坎特维尔夫人的三位法国女教师不到一个月就纷纷果断提出了辞职。因此，他发出了最恐怖的笑声，直使老拱形屋顶发出一次次轰鸣，但还没等可怕的回声消失，门就突然洞开，只见身穿淡蓝色睡衣的奥蒂斯夫人走了出来。“我担心你身体不好，”她说，“就给你带来了一瓶多贝尔医生的酊剂。如果是消化不良，你就会发现这是一服极其有效的药。”幽灵愤怒地瞪着她，随即准备把自己变成一只大黑狗，他这一手名不虚传，家庭医生总是把坎特维尔勋爵的叔叔托马斯·霍顿阁下的永久性痴呆归结于这一手。然而，越来越近的脚步声使他在自己毁灭性的意图上举棋不定，所以他自我满足般地变成了微弱的磷光，就在双胞胎赶到他身边之时，发出了一声低沉的哀叹，销声匿迹。

到达自己房间的时候，他完全崩溃了，被最强烈的焦虑不安的情绪所折磨。双胞胎的粗俗无礼和奥蒂斯太太的唯利是图自然特别让人恼火，但真正让他最痛苦的是，他未能穿上盔甲。他希望，即使是现代美国人，看到穿盔甲的幽灵也会不寒而栗，要是没有更合理的理由，至少出于对他们本国诗人朗费罗的尊重，也应该这样。坎特维尔一家待在城里的时候，他就在朗费罗优雅迷人的诗歌上打发了许多无聊的时光。此外，这是他自己的盔甲。他曾穿着这身盔甲在凯尼尔沃思擂台赛上大获成功，受到了童贞女王[6]本人的高度称赞。然而，他穿上去的时候，已经完全不堪巨大胸甲和钢盔的重负，沉重地倒在了石砌路面上，两只膝盖严重脱皮，还擦伤了右手指关节。

此后几天，他病得特别厉害，除了正常维护血迹之外，几乎足不出户。然而，通过悉心照料自己，他恢复了过来，并决心第三次尝试吓唬美国公使和他的家人。他选择了八月十七日星期五现身，那天大部分时间他都在仔细查看自己的衣柜，最终决定挑选一顶带有一根红色羽毛的大宽边软帽，一条在腕部和颈部饰有褶边的裹尸布，还有一把生锈的匕首。傍晚时分，一场猛烈的暴雨突然袭来，风很大，老房子的所有门窗都震得嘎嘎作响。实际上，这正是他喜爱的天气。他的行动计划是这样的：他要悄悄地走进华盛顿·奥蒂斯的房间，站在床脚对他胡言乱语，并伴着缓慢的音乐，在自己的喉咙上连刺三下。他对华盛顿怀有一种特别的怨恨，因为他完全清楚，正是这个人习惯使用平克顿出品的完美牌洗涤剂，除去远近闻名的坎特维尔的血迹。等这个鲁莽蛮干的年轻人进入一种绝望的恐惧状态之后，他就会进入美国公使夫妇占据的房间，到了那里把一只湿冷的手放在奥蒂斯夫人的额头上，同时冲她瑟瑟颤抖的丈夫的耳朵咝咝有声地说出尸骨存放所的可怕秘密。对于小弗吉尼娅，他还没有完全打定主意。她漂亮温柔，从来没有以任何方式侮辱过他。他认为，从衣柜里发出几声空洞的呻吟就够了，如果那样叫不醒她，他可能会用麻痹抽搐的手指朝着床罩摸索几下。至于双胞胎，他下定决心要教训他们一顿。当然，要做的第一件事就是坐在他们的胸上，以使他们产生噩梦般的窒息感。随后，因为他们的床彼此挨得相当近，所以他要以冰冷的绿色尸体的样子站在他们之间，直到把他们吓瘫。最后他要脱掉裹尸布，露出白森森的骨头和一只圆溜溜的眼珠在房间里爬来爬去，扮演“哑巴丹尼尔，即自杀者的骷髅”，凭借这个角色，他不止一次产生过极大影响，而且他认为，这完全可以跟他扮演的著名角色“疯子马丁，即蒙面神秘人”相媲美。

十点半，他听到这家人上床睡觉了。有一段时间，他受到了双胞胎尖声狂笑的打搅，显然，他们带着学童那样的轻松愉快，在休息之前正自得其乐，但到了十一点一刻，一切都静了下来，当午夜钟声响起的时候，他开始动身了。猫头鹰反复拍打着窗玻璃，乌鸦在老紫杉树上呱呱叫着，风呜咽着像丢了魂似的绕房徘徊；但是，奥蒂斯一家却正睡着，没有意识到自己的厄运。穿过降雨声和风暴声，他能听到美国公使持续不断的打鼾声高声传来。他偷偷地走出护墙板，布满皱纹的残忍的嘴角上浮起了邪恶的笑容。护墙上有一扇大凸肚窗，窗上装饰有他自己和他被害妻子的天蓝色和金色的纹章。当他偷偷地经过那里的时候，月亮把脸躲在了一朵云里。他像邪恶的影子似的不停地滑行，他经过的时候，黑暗也似乎对他深恶痛绝。有一次，他认为自己听到什么东西在叫喊，就停下了脚步，不过那只是从红色农场传来的狗叫声。于是，他继续向前走，喃喃自语着十六世纪的奇怪咒语，在午夜的空中不时地挥舞着生锈的匕首。最后，他到达了通向倒霉的华盛顿房间的通道拐角处。他在那里停顿了一会儿，头上的灰发被风吹拂着，古怪地打着卷儿，就像死人身上的裹尸布，有种无法形容的恐怖。接着，钟敲响了十二点一刻，他觉得时候到了，于是独自轻声笑了起来，转过了拐角。但是，刚转过那个拐角，他就发出了一声恐怖可怜的哀号，连连后退，把惨白的脸藏在了瘦长的双手里。只见在他面前正站着一个可怕的幽灵，犹如一尊雕像般一动不动，像疯子的梦一样骇人听闻！它的头光秃锃亮，它的脸圆胖惨白，狞笑似乎已经把它的五官扭曲定形，眼里冒出一道道深红色的光线，嘴巴张得像一口宽宽的火井，泰坦巨人般的身躯上裹着一件极其可怕的服装，就像他自己身上的这件一样，悄无声息地掉着雪片般的碎渣。它的胸部是一个标语牌，上面是用古老的字符写成的奇怪文字，看上去像是某种耻辱名册、野蛮犯罪记录、可怕的犯罪日程表。它的右手还高举着一把寒光闪闪的钢刀。

他以前从来没有见过幽灵，自然怕得要死，匆匆地瞥了一眼那个可怕的幽灵之后，便往自己的房间逃。他顺着走廊飞奔的时候，还绊倒在了长长的裹尸布上，并把那把生锈的匕首掉在了公使的长筒靴里。第二天早晨，男管家在那里发现了那把匕首。一回到自己的密室，他就扑倒在一张简陋的小床上，把脸隐藏在衣服下面。但是，过了一段时间，老坎特维尔的勇敢精神占了上风，于是他决定天一亮就去找另一个幽灵聊聊。因此，正当曙光给层层山峦染上一道道银色的时候，他赶回了他第一次看到那个可怕的幽灵的地方，他心里想，两个幽灵毕竟比一个好，而且，凭借新朋友的帮助，说不定还能稳妥地跟双胞胎搏斗。然而，到达现场后，他看到了一个可怕的景象。那个幽灵显然出了什么状况，因为光已经完全从它空洞的眼里消逝了，寒光闪闪的弯刀从它的手里掉落下来，它正以一种紧张不适的姿态靠在墙上。他冲上前，一把将它抱在怀里，这时让他恐惧的是，幽灵的脑袋滑下，滚落在地板上，身体呈斜倚的姿势。他发现自己紧抱着一条白色凸花条纹的布床帏，一把扫帚、一把厨房切肉刀和一只空心萝卜躺在他的脚边！他无法理解这种奇怪的转变，就心急火燎地抓紧标语牌，在灰色的晨光中读到了这些可怕的话：





奥蒂斯幽灵

唯一正宗真鬼

如有雷同

实属仿效





整个事情闪过他的脑海。他上当受骗，被涮了一把！他的眼里又闪现出过去那个坎特维尔的神情；他把失去牙齿的牙床咬在一起，干瘪的双手高举过头顶，以旧时学院派的独特措辞发誓说，雄鸡两次鸣唱，血腥之事酝酿，杀戮悄然蔓延。

他刚说完这个可怕的誓言，一只公鸡就在遥远宅地的红瓦屋顶上啼鸣起来。他发出了一阵悠长低沉的苦笑，等待着。他等了一个小时又一个小时，但由于某种莫名其妙的原因，公鸡没再啼鸣。最后，到了七点半钟，女佣们的到来使他放弃了可怕的守夜，他大步回到自己的房间，想着自己徒劳的誓言和夭折的计划。在那里，他查阅了自己特别喜欢的几本古典骑士传奇后发现，主人公每一次发出誓言，公鸡总是啼鸣两遍。“让那只不听话的公鸡毁灭，”他喃喃地说，“我总有一天要用结实的长矛刺穿它的喉咙，让它为我啼鸣，就是死也要啼鸣！”说完，他就退入了一具舒适的铅棺里，在那里一直待到了晚上。





第四章


第二天，幽灵有气无力、疲惫不堪。过去四个星期的可怕刺激开始有了效果。他的神经被彻底弄垮了，最轻微的声音都会让他猛地一惊。他在房间里待了五天，最后打定主意不再关注书房地板上的血迹。如果奥蒂斯的家人不想要它，那他们显然就不应该得到它。显而易见，他们是在低级物质层面存在的人，完全欣赏不了审美现象的象征性价值。显灵的问题和魂灵的演变当然完全是另一回事，真的不在他的控制之下。每星期出现在走廊里一次，每月的第一个和第三个星期三在大凸肚窗边喋喋不休，这些都是他庄严的责任，他不明白怎么才能体面地从自己的义务中逃脱。他的生活十分邪恶，这千真万确，但另一方面，他对与超自然现象相关的所有东西都尽心尽责。因此，接下来的三个星期六，他还是像往常一样，在午夜到凌晨三点之间穿过走廊，采取各种可能的预防措施，以免让人听到或看到。他脱下靴子，尽可能轻地踩在虫蛀的地板上，穿上宽大的黑天鹅绒外衣，认真使用旭日牌润滑剂给他的锁链上油。我必须承认，他的确用了九牛二虎之力才让自己采取了这最后的保护模式。虽然勉强，但一天夜里，当那家人在吃饭的时候，他还是溜进了奥蒂斯先生的卧室，拿走了那只瓶子。他起先感到有点儿羞愧，但后来足够明智地看到，这个发明可以说有极大的好处，而且在一定程度上，对他的计划有所帮助。然而，尽管他做了这所有一切，但依然不是毫无困扰。他顺着走廊走时得一直拉着链子，在黑暗中常常被绊倒；有一次，双胞胎兄弟给挂毯房间的入口到橡木楼梯的顶部之间的地板涂了一层黄油，他打扮成“黑以撒，即霍格莱林地猎手”，踩在了上面，重重地摔了一跤。这最后的侮辱就这样激怒了他，他决定做最后一次努力，以维护自己的尊严和社会地位，打算第二天夜里扮成大名鼎鼎的“鲁莽的鲁珀特，即无头伯爵”，去探望那两个粗野无礼的伊顿学童。

他已经七十多年没有以这种装扮现身了，尽管他曾经借此吓唬过漂亮的芭芭拉·莫迪什夫人。当时芭芭拉突然跟现在的坎特维尔勋爵的祖父解除了婚约，跟英俊的杰克·格雷卡斯尔顿私奔去了格雷特纳格林镇，宣称这世界上任何东西都诱使不了她嫁入这个家庭，因为这个家庭居然允许一个如此可怕的幽灵黄昏时分沿着平台走来走去。后事，可怜的杰克在旺兹沃思[7]公有地的一次决斗中被坎特维尔勋爵枪杀。那一年还没有过完，芭芭拉夫人就因心碎而死在了坦布里奇韦尔斯市，因此可以说，他在各个方面都取得了巨大的成功。然而，这是一次难度极高的“装扮”，如果我可以用“装扮”这样一个剧场用语来表达与超自然——采用更科学的术语，是高级的自然世界——最大谜团之一相关的现象的话，这整整花费了他三个小时的时间进行准备。最后，一切就绪，他对自己的外表格外满意。跟衣服搭配的大皮马靴对他来说只是有点儿大，两把马上用的手枪他只能找到一把，但总的来说他十分满意。一点一刻，他滑出了护墙板，沿着走廊悄悄前行。他走到双胞胎占据的房间——我应该提一下，这个房间因悬挂的帷幔的颜色而被称为蓝卧室——发现房门只是半掩着。他想做出一些惊悚的效果，就猛地一把推开房门，这时一罐沉甸甸的水正好泼在他的身上，令他浑身上下湿了个透，而且罐子差两英寸就砸中了他的左肩。与此同时，他听到从四柱床那里传来的压抑的尖笑声。这对他的神经系统冲击如此巨大，他尽了最大努力逃回自己的房间，第二天因重感冒而卧病在床。整个事件中唯一安慰他的就是他没有带去自己的脑袋，因为如果他这样做，后果可能会非常严重。

他现在放弃了吓唬这个粗鲁的美国家庭的所有希望，通常只满足于自己穿着拖鞋在走廊里悄悄地来回走动，脖子上围着厚厚的红围巾，生怕有穿堂风，还带着一支小小的火绳枪，以防受到双胞胎兄弟的攻击。他受到的最后一击，发生在九月十九日。他下楼去宽大的门厅，感觉至少在那里完全不会受到骚扰，并借对美国公使夫妇在萨罗尼摄制的巨幅照片的冷嘲热讽自娱自乐，这些照片现在已经取代了坎特维尔家族的肖像画。他穿着虽朴素却整洁的长寿衣，上面带着墓地的霉斑，用黄麻布条绑住下巴，一只手提着一盏小灯笼，另一只手拎着一把教堂司事的铁锹。实际上，他扮的是“无墓乔纳斯，即彻特西谷仓夺尸鬼”这个角色，这是他最出色的扮相之一，也是坎特维尔家族有充分理由记住的扮相之一，因为这是他们跟邻居拉福德勋爵争吵的真正由来。当时是深夜两点一刻左右，而且，就他所能查明的情况来看，没有人在走动。然而，当他朝书房信步走去，看看有没有留下什么血迹的时候，突然从黑暗的角落里跳出两个身影扑向了他，只见那两个身影在头顶疯狂地挥舞着他们的胳膊，冲他的耳朵“噗！”地尖叫着。

在这种情况下，惊慌失措是最自然不过的事儿，他冲向楼梯，却发现华盛顿·奥蒂斯正拿着花园大洒水器在那里等着他。如此一来，他被敌人四面包围，几乎走投无路，只好钻进了大铁炉子。对他来说，幸运的是炉子没有生火，他只好从烟道和烟囱爬行回家，以一种肮脏、混乱和绝望的可怕状态到达了自己的房间。

之后，再也没有见到他进行任何夜间探险。双胞胎埋伏着等待了他好几次，让他们的父母和仆人大为烦恼的是，每天夜里他们用坚果壳撒满了那些走廊，但依然无济于事。显而易见，他的感情受到了如此的伤害，再也不愿现身了。因此，奥蒂斯先生重又写起了他那本有关民主党历史的伟大著作，这本书他已经专心致志地写了几年时间；奥蒂斯太太举办了一次精彩的蛤蜊烘烤宴，这让全郡人都叹为观止；男孩们开始打曲棍球，玩尤克牌[8]和扑克，以及其他美国游戏；在柴郡的年轻公爵的陪同下，弗吉尼娅骑着小马在路上四处走动，这位公爵是来坎特维尔猎场度过自己假期的最后一个星期的。人们普遍认为，幽灵已经走了。而且，实际上，奥蒂斯先生给坎特维尔勋爵写了一封信，告诉了他这件事情。坎特维尔勋爵回信表示，听到这个消息他非常高兴，并向公使可敬的妻子送去了最美好的祝贺。

然而，奥蒂斯一家受到了蒙骗，因为幽灵还在房子里，尽管现在几乎成了残废，但他绝不愿善罢甘休，尤其是听说客人们当中有柴郡的年轻公爵的时候。那位公爵的伯祖父弗朗西斯·斯蒂尔顿勋爵曾经跟卡伯里上校赌了一百几尼，说他要跟坎特维尔的幽灵玩骰子。第二天早上，人们发现斯蒂尔顿勋爵处在一种十分无助的瘫痪状态，躺在牌室的地板上，尽管他一直活到了高寿，但他再也说不出“双六”之外的任何事情了。当然，尽管出于对两个贵族家庭感情的尊重，大家想方设法隐瞒这件事，但这个故事当时还是家喻户晓，后来人们发现坦特尔勋爵的《回忆摄政王及其朋友们》第三卷中也有与这件事有关的所有情况的详尽叙述。那么，幽灵自然迫不及待地想要证明他没有失去对斯蒂尔顿一家的影响力。其实，他跟斯蒂尔顿一家是远亲，因为自己的堂妹再婚嫁给了德·巴尔克利先生，每个人都知道，柴郡的公爵们是巴尔克利先生的直系后裔。因此，他安排停当，打算以“吸血幽灵修士，即没有血色的本笃会[9]修士”的著名扮相出现在弗吉尼娅的小情人面前。这个表演可怕极了，一七六四年那个致命的除夕，斯塔尔普老太太看到这一情景，突然发出了最刺耳的尖叫声。这次尖叫以严重的中风而告终。不到三天，她就撒手而去了。临终前，她剥夺了自己最近的亲属坎特维尔一家的继承权，把她所有的钱都留给了她的伦敦药剂师。然而，在最后时刻，对双胞胎兄弟的恐惧使他没敢离开自己的房间。公爵安睡在皇家寝宫硕大的羽毛华盖下面，还梦到了弗吉尼娅。





第五章


之后过了几天，弗吉尼娅和她的鬈发骑士出门，前往布洛克雷牧场骑马。到了那里，在穿过一道树篱的时候，她挂坏了骑装，所以他们回家后，她打定主意从后楼梯上去，以免被人看见。她跑过挂毯屋的时候，门正好开着，她看见里面好像有人，认为那是她母亲的侍女，侍女有时会把活计带到那里做，所以她就朝里面看了看，想请侍女给她修补一下骑装。然而，让她无比惊讶的是，那居然是坎特维尔的幽灵！只见他正坐在窗边，望着金黄色的落叶飘过空中，红叶沿着长长的林荫道狂舞。他的头倚在一只手上，整个姿态看上去极度消沉。实际上，小弗吉尼娅看到他的第一个想法就是逃走，然后把自己锁在房间里，但她又感到了怜悯，决心去设法安慰他。她的脚步是那么轻，他的忧郁是那么深，直到她对他说话，他才意识到她的存在。

“真是抱歉，”她说，“但我的两个弟弟明天将返回伊顿公学，之后，如果你行为规矩的话，就没有人会打扰你。”

“要求我行为规矩，真是荒唐，”他一边回答，一边惊讶地回头望着这个斗胆跟他说话的漂亮小女孩，“真是可笑极了。我必须把锁链晃得叮当乱响，透过锁孔发出呻吟，夜里走来走去，你指的是这些吗？这是我存在的唯一理由。”

“这根本不是存在的理由，你知道你一向邪恶透顶。我们来到这里的第一天，乌姆妮太太告诉我们说，你杀了自己的妻子。”

“好吧，我完全承认这一点，”幽灵气急败坏地说，“但那纯粹是一个家庭问题，跟别人无关。”

“杀死任何一个人，都是非常错误的。”弗吉尼娅说，她不时地表现出一种可爱的清教徒般的严肃神情，这种严肃源自某个古老的新英格兰祖先。

“噢，我讨厌抽象道德的假正经！我的妻子相貌平平，从来没有浆好过我的衣领，而且对烹饪一无所知。哎呀，有一次我在霍格莱树林打死了一只公鹿，那是一只非常壮硕的两岁公鹿，你知道她是怎么把它送上餐桌的吗？不管怎样，现在都无关紧要了，因为一切都过去了，尽管的确是我杀了她，但我认为，她的兄弟们把我饿死也不是很地道。”

“把你饿死？噢，幽灵先生，我是说西蒙先生，你饿了吗？我的盒子里有一块三明治。你喜欢吃吗？”

“不，谢谢你，我现在从来不吃任何东西。不过，你还是有情有义，比你那些可怕、粗鲁、庸俗而又不诚实的家人好多了。”

“住口！”弗吉尼娅跺着脚嚷道，“可怕、粗鲁、庸俗的是你，至于不诚实，你自己清楚，你从我的盒子里偷走了我的颜料，试图保持书房里那块荒唐可笑的血迹。首先，你拿走了我所有的红色，包括朱红色，结果任何落日我都画不成了，接着你拿走了翠绿色和铬黄色，最后我只剩下了靛蓝和中国白，只能画月光下的场景，可那景象总是令人沮丧，也根本不容易画。尽管我气得不行，但我从来没有告发过你，整个事情真是荒唐极了，谁曾经听说过翠绿色的血液呢？”

“噢，真的吗？”幽灵颇为温顺地说，“我该怎么办？如今很难搞到真正的血了，况且，你的兄弟一开始就用完美牌洗涤剂挑起事端，我当然看不出有什么理由不拿你的颜料。至于颜色，这始终是一个品位的问题。比如，坎特维尔家族具有贵族血统——英国最高贵的血统；可是，我知道你们美国人不关心这样的事儿。”

“你对此一无所知，而你能做得最好的事儿就是移居国外，长长见识。我的父亲会十分乐意给你自由通行权，尽管那里各种烈酒都有重税，但海关方面不会有任何困难，因为那些官员都是民主党人。一旦到了纽约，你就一定能大获成功。我知道，那里好多人愿意出十万美元获得一个爷爷，而对于一个家族幽灵出价会高得多。”

“我认为我不会喜欢美国。”

“我想是因为我们没有废墟，也没有古玩。”弗吉尼娅讥讽地说。

“不要废墟！不要古玩！”幽灵回答说，“还有你们的海军和美式礼仪。”

“再见，我要去请求爸爸再给这对双胞胎一个星期假。”

“请不要走，弗吉尼娅小姐，”他喊道，“我很孤独，也很不开心，我真不知道该怎么办。我想去睡觉，却又睡不着。”

“这相当荒唐！你只需上床，吹灭蜡烛就行了。有时保持清醒很难，尤其是在教堂，但睡觉根本不难。哎呀，就是婴儿也知道该怎么做，而他们并不是很聪明。”

“我已经三百年没有睡过觉了，”他伤心地说，弗吉尼娅美丽的蓝眼睛惊奇地睁大，“三百年来我都没有睡过觉了，我好累呀。”

弗吉尼娅变得相当严肃，小小的嘴唇像玫瑰花叶一样颤抖。她向他走来，在他的身边跪下来，抬起头，望着他苍老干瘪的脸庞。

“可怜巴巴的幽灵，”她喃喃地说，“你没有可以睡觉的地方吗？”

“在很远的松林那边，”他用梦幻般的声音低沉地答道，“有一座小花园。那里的草长得又高又深，那里有又大又白的星形的铁杉花，那里的夜莺彻夜鸣唱。它彻夜鸣唱，水晶般的寒月俯瞰下方，紫杉树展开巨大的手臂撑在沉睡者的上方。”

弗吉尼娅渐渐地泪眼模糊，把脸藏在了自己的双手里。

“你是说死亡花园吧。”她低声说道。

“是的，是死亡。死亡一定非常美丽。躺在柔软的褐色泥土里，青草在头顶晃动，倾听寂静的声音。没有昨天，也没有明天。要忘却时间，要原谅生活，要安宁。你可以帮助我。你可以为我打开死亡之屋的门，因为爱跟你永在，爱比死亡更强大。”

弗吉尼娅一哆嗦，浑身打了个冷战，有片刻的沉默。她觉得自己仿佛是在一个可怕的梦里。

这时，幽灵又说起了话，他的声音听上去就像是风的叹息。

“你读过书房窗户上的那段古老预言吗？”

“噢，经常读，”小女孩抬起头大声说道，“我一清二楚。那是用古怪的黑色字母涂写的，读起来很难。只有六行：





当可人的女孩能从罪恶之口，

赢得一次次祈祷，

当荒芜的巴旦木有果实结出，

小孩子流下一颗颗泪珠，

这时整个房子一片静悄悄，

坎特维尔的安宁就会来到。





但我不知道这是什么意思。”

“这些话是说，”他伤心地说，“你必须跟我一起为我的罪恶哭泣，因为我没有眼泪；跟我一起为我的灵魂祈祷，因为我没有信仰；接下来，如果你始终甜美、善良和温柔，死亡天使就会怜悯我。你会在黑暗中看到形形色色可怕的身影，各种各样邪恶的声音会在你的耳边低语，但它们伤害不了你，因为地狱的力量对小孩子的纯真发挥不了作用。”

弗吉尼娅没有回答，幽灵一边俯视着她低垂的金发脑袋，一边十分绝望地绞着双手。突然，她站起来，脸色煞白，眼里有一种异样的光芒。“我不害怕，”她坚定地说，“我会请天使怜悯你的。”

他发出了一声轻微的欢呼，从座位上站起身，拉住她的手，以古老优雅的方式弯下腰，吻了吻。他的手指像冰一样冷，嘴唇像火一样烫。但当他领着弗吉尼娅穿过昏暗的房间的时候，她没有动摇。淡绿色的挂毯上绣着一些小猎人。这些小猎人吹着流苏号角，挥动着小手让她回去。“回去！小弗吉尼娅，”他们喊道，“回去吧！”然而，幽灵把她的手抓得更紧了。于是，她闭上了眼睛，不再看那些小猎手。一些带有蜥蜴尾巴的可怕动物从雕刻的壁炉架上对她眨着金鱼眼睛，喃喃地说：“当心！小弗吉尼娅，当心！我们可能再也见不到你了。”但是，幽灵向前滑行得更快了，弗吉尼娅听而不闻。当他们走到房间尽头的时候，他停下来，喃喃地说了一些她听不懂的话。她睁开眼睛，看到墙像雾一样慢慢地消失，一个巨大的黑色洞穴出现在她面前。一阵刺骨的寒风从他们身边扫过，她感觉有什么东西拽着她的衣服。“快，快，”幽灵喊道，“否则就来不及了。”护墙板立刻就在他们身后合拢了，挂毯屋空空如也。





第六章


大约十分钟后，下午茶的铃声响了，弗吉尼娅没有下来，奥蒂斯太太就派一个男仆上去告诉她。过了一小会儿，男仆回来说，哪里都找不到弗吉尼娅小姐。她每天晚上都习惯到花园里为餐桌采花，奥蒂斯太太起初毫不惊慌，但当六点的钟声敲响，弗吉尼娅还是没有出现的时候，她才真正焦虑不安起来，打发男孩子们出去寻找，她自己和奥蒂斯先生则搜寻了家里的每个房间。到了六点半钟，男孩子们回来说，他们哪里都没有发现妹妹的踪影。他们现在都处在最紧张的状态，不知道该怎么办，这时奥蒂斯先生突然想起，几天前他曾经允许一伙吉卜赛人在公园里扎营。于是，他立刻动身前往布莱克菲尔洼地，他知道他们在那里，他的大儿子和两个农场仆人也陪同前往。柴郡的年轻公爵急得完全像发了疯似的，苦苦哀求允许他也一起去，但奥蒂斯先生不准他去，因为他担心会有一场混战。然而，到达现场后，他发现吉卜赛人已经走了，而且显而易见，他们的离开有些突然，因为火还在燃烧，一些盘子躺在草地上。打发华盛顿和两个男仆彻底搜索了这个地区之后，他跑回家，给郡里的所有警督发了电报，让他们留心一个被流浪汉或吉卜赛人绑架的小女孩。然后，他吩咐人牵来他的马，坚决要求他的妻子和三个男孩子坐下来吃完饭后，就带着一个马夫沿着阿斯科特路策马飞奔。然而，他刚跑了两英里，就听到在他后面有人骑马追来。他回过头，看到是年轻的公爵骑着小马追来，只见他满脸通红，没戴帽子。“非常抱歉，奥蒂斯先生，”男孩子气喘吁吁地说，“但只要弗吉尼娅还没有找到，我就吃不下饭。请不要生我的气。如果去年你让我们订婚的话，就绝不会有这一切麻烦了。你不要送我回去，好吗？我不能走！我不愿回去！”

公使禁不住对这个年轻英俊的纨绔少年露出了微笑，并为他对弗吉尼娅的一心一意而深受感动。于是他从马上俯下身来，亲切地拍了拍他的肩膀，说：“好吧，塞西尔，如果你不愿回去，我想你就必须跟我走，但到了阿斯科特，我必须给你买一顶帽子。”

“噢，不要操心我的帽子了！我想要弗吉尼娅！”年轻的公爵笑着嚷道。于是，他们向火车站疾驰而去。到了那里，奥蒂斯先生询问站长，有没有在月台上见过跟弗吉尼娅的相貌特征符合的人，但没能得到她的任何消息。不过，站长给沿线车站去了电报，并向他保证，他们会密切注意她。奥蒂斯先生从一个正要打烊的亚麻布料商那里为公爵买了一顶帽子后，骑马赶往大约四英里远的贝克斯利村，有人告诉他说，这是一个远近闻名的吉卜赛人经常聚会的地方，因为旁边有一大块公有地。在这里，他们叫醒了村里的一个警察，但从他那里没能得到任何信息，接着，骑马找遍了那块公有地之后，他们掉转马头回家，十一点左右到达了猎场，筋疲力尽，几乎伤心欲绝。林荫道黑黢黢的，他们发现华盛顿和双胞胎兄弟提着灯笼在门房口等着他们，没有发现弗吉尼娅的一丝痕迹。尽管人们在布洛克雷牧场抓住了那些吉卜赛人，但她没有跟他们在一起。他们解释说，他们之所以突然离开，是因为他们搞错了乔顿集市的日期，于是匆匆离开，唯恐迟到。实际上，听到弗吉尼娅失踪的消息，他们都万分痛苦，非常感激奥蒂斯先生允许他们在公园里扎营，于是留下了其中四个人来帮助寻找。鲤鱼塘已经被打捞了一遍，整个猎场都彻底搜过了一遍，但没有任何结果。显而易见，那天夜里他们无论如何也找不到弗吉尼娅了。奥蒂斯先生和孩子们走向房子，沮丧到了极点，马夫牵着两匹马和那匹小马跟在后面。到了大厅，他们看到了一群惊慌失措的仆人，躺在书房沙发上的是可怜的奥蒂斯太太，她因恐惧和焦虑而几乎失去了理智，老管家往她的额头上抹了些科隆香水。奥蒂斯先生马上督促她吃些东西，并吩咐给全体人员上晚饭。这顿晚饭吃得闷闷不乐，因为几乎没有任何人说话，就连双胞胎兄弟也诚惶诚恐、服服帖帖，因为他们非常喜欢自己的姐姐。他们吃完饭后，奥蒂斯先生不顾年轻公爵的苦苦哀求，命令他们都统统睡觉，说那天夜里什么也做不了了，他第二天早上会给苏格兰场发电报，让他们马上派一些侦探来。就在他们走出餐厅的时候，钟楼传来了午夜的钟声，而当最后一声响过之后，他们听到了碰撞声和一声凄厉的尖叫；一阵可怕的炸雷声震撼了整个房子，一串奇异神秘的音乐旋律飘过了空中，楼梯顶部的面板随着一声巨响飞落，只见弗吉尼娅脸色惨白，一只手拿着一个小盒子，走到了外面的楼梯平台上。他们都立刻冲到了她身边。奥蒂斯太太热情地把她紧抱在怀里，公爵的吻让她几乎透不过气来，双胞胎绕着他们跳起了疯狂的战舞。

“天哪！孩子，你到哪里去了？”奥蒂斯先生有些生气地说，以为她一直在跟他们玩某个愚蠢的把戏，“我和塞西尔骑着马一直在到处找你，你的母亲吓得要死。你千万不要再搞这些恶作剧了。”

“只对幽灵搞！只对幽灵搞！”双胞胎雀跃着，尖叫着。

“我的心肝宝贝，感谢上帝，总算找到你了，你千万不要再离开我的身边了。”奥蒂斯太太一边喃喃地说，一边吻着浑身颤抖的孩子，捋了捋她乱蓬蓬的金发。

“爸爸，”弗吉尼娅平静地说，“我刚才跟幽灵在一起。他死了，你一定要来看看他。他曾经十分邪恶，但他也为自己所做的一切感到抱歉。去世前，他把这盒美丽的珠宝送给了我。”

全家人默然无声，惊讶地凝视着她，但她非常严肃和认真。她转过身，带领他们沿着一条狭窄的秘密走廊穿过护墙板的缺口，华盛顿从桌子上抓起一支点燃的蜡烛跟在后面。最后，他们来到了一个高大的橡木门边，门上钉着生锈的钉子。弗吉尼娅碰了一下门，门就绕着沉重的门枢转了过去，一下子打开了，他们发现自己到了一个低矮的房间，房间带有拱形天花板和一个小小的格子窗。嵌在墙里的是一个巨大的铁环，拴在铁环上的是一具枯瘦的骷髅，骷髅在石头地面上全身伸展开来，似乎是想尽力用没有血肉的瘦长手指去抓住一套老式的木盘和水罐，木盘和水罐正好放在他够不到的地方。水罐显然曾经装满了水，因为里面覆盖了一层绿霉。木盘上只有一堆灰尘。弗吉尼娅在骷髅旁边跪下来，小手合在一起，开始默默祈祷。其他人惊奇地看着这可怕的场景，此刻秘密终于在他们面前揭晓了。

“喂！”双胞胎中的一个突然大叫，他一直望着窗外，想设法发现这个房间位于房子的哪一侧。“喂！那棵枯萎的老杏树已经开花了。我在月光下能清清楚楚地看到那些花。”

“上帝已经原谅了他。”弗吉尼娅严肃地说着，站起身来，一道美丽的光芒似乎照亮了她的脸庞。

“你是多么美丽的天使啊！”年轻的公爵叫道，然后伸出一条胳膊搂住了她的脖子，亲吻了她。





第七章


这些离奇的事件发生后又过了四天，夜里十一点左右，一场葬礼在坎特维尔猎场举行。灵车由八匹黑马拉着，每匹马的头上都戴着一大绺低垂的鸵鸟羽毛，铅棺覆盖着浓紫色棺罩，棺罩上面用金线绣着坎特维尔家族的纹章。手持火把的仆人们走在灵车和马车的侧面，整个队伍引人瞩目。坎特维尔勋爵是丧主，特地从威尔士赶来参加葬礼，跟小弗吉尼娅坐在第一辆马车里。随后是美国公使夫妇，接着是华盛顿和三个男孩子，最后一辆马车里是乌姆妮夫人。人们普遍感到，她在一生中曾经被幽灵惊吓了五十多年，有权利看到他最后的结局。教堂墓地的一角已经挖了一个深深的墓穴，就在老紫杉树下面，奥古斯塔斯·丹皮尔牧师以最感人的方式宣读了祭文。仪式结束后，按照坎特维尔家族遵守的古老习俗，仆人们熄灭了火把，在棺材被下到坟墓的时候，弗吉尼娅走上前，把一个由白色和粉红色杏花做成的大十字架放在上面。在她这样做的时候，月亮从一朵云后面钻了出来，默默地把银光洒到了小小的教堂墓地，一只夜莺在远处的一个小灌木林里开始鸣唱。她想起了幽灵对死亡花园的描述，顿时泪眼模糊，坐车回家期间几乎一言不发。

第二天早上，在坎特维尔勋爵上城里之前，奥蒂斯先生跟他会面讨论幽灵送给弗吉尼娅珠宝的问题。这些珠宝完美瑰丽，尤其是一条嵌有古威尼斯背景的红宝石项链，这的确是十六世纪精湛工艺的标本，其价值如此巨大，所以对是否允许女儿接受，奥蒂斯先生顾虑重重。

“亲爱的勋爵，”他说，“我知道，在这个国家，永久管业规定既适用于土地，也适用于饰品。我心知肚明，这些珠宝是，或者说应该是你们的传家宝。因此，我必须请求你随身把它们带到伦敦，仅仅把它们看成是在某种奇怪条件下归还给你的一部分财产。至于我的女儿，她还只是个孩子，我很高兴地说，到现在为止，她对这种奢侈品没有多大兴趣。奥蒂斯太太还告诉我说——她少女时代有幸在波士顿待过好几个冬天，可以说是响当当的艺术行家——这些宝石非常值钱，如果拿去卖的话，一定会卖个高价。坎特维尔勋爵，在这种情况下，我确信你会认识到，对我来说，允许它们留在我的家人手里将是多么难以忍受。而且，实际上，所有这些华而不实的玩物，对英国贵族的体面而言，是多么的适宜和必要，但对那些在严格的——而且我相信是不朽的——共和党的朴素原则下成长的人，却完全格格不入。也许我应该提到，弗吉尼娅非常希望你能允许她保留那个盒子，作为对你那位命运多舛并又误入歧途的祖先的一种纪念。因为盒子特别旧，大概也修不好，所以也许你会认为可以答应她的要求。就我个人而言，我承认，对我的一个孩子居然会带着中世纪精神来展现她的同情心，我感到十分意外。这只能以一个事实做出解释，那就是奥蒂斯太太雅典之行回来后不久，弗吉尼娅出生在了你们伦敦的一个郊区。”

坎特维尔勋爵神情非常严肃地听着可敬的公使讲话，不时地捋捋灰色胡子，掩饰着不由自主的微笑。奥蒂斯先生说完之后，坎特维尔勋爵亲切地握了握他的手，说道：“我亲爱的先生，你的迷人而可爱的小女儿给了我那位倒霉的祖先——西蒙爵士——一个至关重要的帮助，我和我的家人都十分感激她惊人的勇气和胆量。现在珠宝显然是她的，而且，天哪，我相信，如果我足够狠心把它们从她那里拿走的话，那个邪恶的老家伙不出两个星期就会从坟墓里爬出来，让我去过一种魔鬼般的生活。至于他们现有的传家宝，遗嘱或法律文件没有提及的东西不算是传家宝，我们完全不知道这些珠宝的存在。我向你保证，我并不比你的男管家有更多的索要的权力，而当弗吉尼娅小姐长大成人的时候，我敢说她一定会乐意有漂亮的东西穿戴。况且，奥蒂斯先生，你忘了，你对家具和幽灵都估了价，属于幽灵的任何东西随即都归你所有，因此无论西蒙爵士夜里在走廊搞些什么活动，就法律而言，他的确死了，你通过购买获得了他的财产。”

奥蒂斯先生对坎特维尔勋爵的拒绝万分痛苦，恳求他再考虑一下他的决定，但这个心地善良的贵族义无反顾，最终说服了公使，允许他的女儿保留幽灵送给她的礼物。于是，一八九〇年春天，当年轻的柴郡公爵夫人结婚那天，在女王的第一次觐见名媛会上亮相时，她的珠宝得到了大家的一致赞美。因为弗吉尼娅收到了宝冠，这是所有美国好少女都梦想的奖赏，并在自己的情郎一到法定年龄就嫁给了他。他们俩是那么迷人、相亲相爱，每个人都为这桩婚配感到高兴，除了邓布尔顿的老侯爵夫人，她曾经设法抓住公爵，要配给她七个未婚女儿中的一个，并为此举办过不少于三次的昂贵晚宴。还有，说来也怪，就是奥蒂斯先生本人。奥蒂斯先生特别喜欢年轻的公爵本人，但从理论上说，他反对贵族头衔，而且用他自己的话说：“就是不免忧惧，在贵族寻欢作乐、令人萎靡的影响中，共和党朴素精神的真正原则会被忘到脑后。”然而，他的反对意见被完全驳回，我相信，当他让女儿挽着他的胳膊走上汉诺威广场圣乔治教堂过道的时候，整个英格兰再也没有比他更自豪的男人了。

蜜月结束后，公爵夫妇去了坎特维尔猎场，并在抵达后的第二天下午走到了松林边的那个孤独的墓园。起初，他们曾经为西蒙爵士的墓碑碑文绞尽脑汁，但最后决定只简单地刻上老先生姓名的首字母和书房窗户上的那段诗文。公爵夫人随身带来了一些可爱的玫瑰花撒在坟墓上。他们在坟墓边站了一段时间后，漫步走进了老修道院废弃的圣坛。到了那里，公爵夫人在一根倒下的柱子上坐下来，而她的丈夫则躺在她的脚边一边抽烟，一边抬头望着她美丽的大眼睛。突然，他扔掉香烟，握住她的手，对她说道：“弗吉尼娅，妻子不应该对丈夫有任何秘密。”

“亲爱的塞西尔！我对你没有什么秘密啊。”

“有，你有，”他微笑着答道，“你从来没有告诉过我，你跟那个幽灵关在一起的时候发生了什么事情呢。”

“塞西尔，我还从来没有告诉过任何一个人。”弗吉尼娅神情严肃地说。

“这我知道，但你可以告诉我吧。”

“塞西尔，请不要问我，我不能告诉你。可怜的西蒙爵士！我非常感激他。是的，不要笑，塞西尔，我真的非常感激他。他使我明白了人生是什么，死亡意味着什么，为什么爱比这二者都强大。”

公爵站起来，含情脉脉地吻了吻妻子。

“只要我拥有你的心，你就可以拥有自己的秘密。”他喁喁细语。

“你始终都拥有那颗心，塞西尔。”

“而且有朝一日你会告诉我们的孩子们，不是吗？”

弗吉尼娅顿时脸色羞红。

W.H.先生的画像


第一章


有一次，我在鸟笼道厄斯金的漂亮小房子里跟他一起吃饭，后来我们坐进了书房，一边喝咖啡，一边抽烟，这时文学伪造的问题碰巧出现在了谈话当中。我现在记不起是怎么开的头了，那个时候我们突然就想起了这个有些奇怪的话题，但我知道我们就麦克弗森、爱尔兰和查特顿[1]谈论了很久。对于查特顿，我坚持认为他所谓的伪造仅仅是艺术渴望完美表现的产物；我们没有权利指责艺术家选择的展示其作品的那些方式；在某种程度上，所有艺术都是一种表演模式，是一种超越时势约束和现实生活局限，在某个想象层面实现自己个性的尝试，指责艺术家伪造就是混淆道德问题和美学问题。

厄斯金比我年龄大得多，带着四十岁男人有趣的顺从姿态一直在听我说话。他突然把一只手搭在我的肩上，对我说道：“如果一个年轻人对某件艺术品有一种奇怪的理论，他相信自己的理论，并为了证明这个理论而进行伪造，你怎么看？”

“啊！那完全是另一回事。”我回答说。

厄斯金望着香烟袅袅升起的一缕缕灰蒙蒙的细线，沉默了一会儿。“是的，”停顿过后，他说，“完全是另一回事。”

他的语气中有一种什么东西，似乎是一丝轻微的痛苦，这激起了我的好奇心。“你知道那个作假的人？”我嚷道。

“知道，”他一边回答，一边把香烟扔进火里——“是我的一位好友西里尔·格雷厄姆。他既非常迷人，又非常愚蠢，没心没肺。不过，我有生以来得到的唯一一份遗产就是他留给我的。”

“那是什么？”我惊叹道。厄斯金从座位上站起身来，走到立在两个窗户之间的一个高大的嵌花橱柜前，打开柜锁，然后回到我坐的地方，只见他手里拿着一幅小小的嵌板画，那幅画镶嵌在一个略显灰暗的伊丽莎白一世时代的旧画框里。

这是一幅全身画像，只见画上的年轻人穿着十六世纪末的服装，站在一张桌子旁边，右手放在一本打开的书上。他看上去十七岁左右，相貌十分英俊，不过显得有些缺乏阳刚之气。实际上，要不是因为穿着礼服、留着平头，人们会说这张有着梦幻而伤感的眼睛和精巧红唇的脸庞是女孩的。在技法上，尤其是在对双手的处理上，这幅画使人想起了弗朗索瓦·克卢埃[2]的晚期作品。黑天鹅绒紧身上衣配有别致的镀金圆点，孔雀蓝的底色将它衬托得赏心悦目，因此让它获得了明亮的色彩，颇具克卢埃的风格。大理石底座上规整地挂着两副分别代表悲剧和喜剧的面具，格调是那样刻板而严肃——跟意大利画家的温和优雅截然不同——即使是在法国的宫廷，那位伟大的佛兰德大师也永远不会完全失去这种格调，这种格调一向是北方性情的一个特点。

“这是一幅迷人的画，”我叫道，“艺术如此幸运地为我们保存了他的美貌，但这个令人惊叹的年轻人是谁呢？”

“这是W.H.先生的肖像。”厄斯金面带苦笑说。可能是光线碰巧产生的效果，我看到他的眼里闪着泪光。

“W.H.先生！”我大声嚷道，“W.H.先生是谁？”

“你不记得了吗？”他反问道，“看看他那只手正按着的那本书。”

“我看到那里有一些笔迹，但我看不清是什么。”我答道。

“拿这个放大镜试试看。”厄斯金嘴角仍然泛着苦笑说。

我接过放大镜，把灯又移近了一点，开始拼出潦草的十六世纪的笔迹。“献给下列这些十四行诗的唯一促成者……”“天哪！”我叫道，“这就是莎士比亚的那个W.H.先生？”

“西里尔·格雷厄姆过去经常这样说。”厄斯金咕哝道。

“可他一点也不像彭布罗克勋爵，”我回答说，“我对彭斯赫斯特的画像非常熟悉。几个星期前，我就待在那附近。”

“这么说，你真的相信那些十四行诗是写给彭布罗克勋爵的？”他问。

“我敢肯定这一点，”我答道，“彭布罗克、莎士比亚和玛丽·菲顿夫人是那些十四行诗的三个主要人物，这一点毫无疑问。”

“好吧，我同意你的观点，”厄斯金说，“但我并不总是这么认为。我过去一直相信——嗯，我想我过去一直相信西里尔·格雷厄姆和他的理论。”

“那是什么？”我看着这幅令人赞叹的画像问，在我看来，它已经开始产生一种奇异的魅力。

“说来话长，”说着，厄斯金从我手里拿走了那幅画像——当时我觉得有些突然——“说来话长啊。不过，如果你愿意听的话，我就告诉你。”

“我对有关十四行诗的理论兴趣浓厚，”我大声说道，“但我认为我不可能转而相信任何新的理论。这个问题对任何人都不再是一个谜了。实际上，我想这从来就不是一个谜。”

“我不再相信这个理论，所以也不可能让你去相信它，”厄斯金笑着说道，“但它可能会使你感兴趣。”

“当然，那就告诉我吧，”我回答说，“如果它有那幅画的一半赏心悦目，我就会十分满意。”

“好吧，”说着，厄斯金点了一支香烟，“我必须先给你讲一下西里尔·格雷厄姆本人的情况。我和他在伊顿公学时住在同一个房子里。我比他大一两岁，但我们是非常要好的朋友，一起学习和玩乐。当然，玩乐的时间要比学习的时间多得多，但我从未为此感到后悔。接受良好的商科教育并不总是有好处，我在伊顿公学的运动场上学到的东西完全像我在剑桥学到的一样有用。我应该告诉你，西里尔的父亲和母亲都去世了。他们是在离开怀特岛的一次可怕的游艇事故中淹死的。他的父亲曾在外交部门工作，娶了老克雷迪顿勋爵的女儿——唯一的女儿。他的父母亲去世后，老克雷迪顿勋爵就成了西里尔的监护人。我认为克雷迪顿勋爵并不算十分关心西里尔。他一直没有真正原谅自己的女儿嫁给了一个没有贵族头衔的男人。他是一位与众不同的老贵族，像蔬果小贩那样骂人，而且一举一动都像一个农民。我记得在演讲日那天见过他一次。他对我咆哮，给我一枚金币，告诉我不要像我的父亲那样长成‘该死的激进分子’。西里尔对他没有多少感情，大部分假日反倒十分乐意和我们在苏格兰度过。他们从来没有真正在一起相处过。西里尔认为他野蛮愚蠢，而他则认为西里尔柔弱无力。尽管西里尔是非常出色的骑手和一流的击剑手，但我想他在某些事情上确实十分柔弱。实际上，在离开伊顿公学前，他就开始练剑了。可是，他行事懒散，对自己的俊俏外表自命不凡，而且强烈反感足球。真正给他带来快乐的两件事情就是诗歌和表演。在伊顿公学，他总是饰演莎士比亚戏剧中的角色，吟诵莎士比亚的作品，去读三一学院后，第一学期就成了业余戏剧俱乐部的一员。我还记得我总是非常嫉妒他的演技。我对他的关注到了荒唐的程度，我想，这是因为我们在某些事情上截然不同。我是一个笨手笨脚、虚弱无力的小伙子，满脸都是可怕的雀斑，还有一双大脚。雀斑在苏格兰家庭就像痛风在英格兰家庭一样流行。西里尔过去常说，两者中他更喜欢痛风。他高度重视个人形象，几乎到了荒唐的地步。有一次他在我们辩论团前念了一篇论文，证明人心好不如相貌好。他的确英俊帅气。不喜欢他的人、平庸之辈和大学教师，还有为了进教会而读书的年轻人过去常说，他不过是徒有其表罢了。然而，那张脸不光是英俊，内涵要比这丰富得多。我认为，他是我见过的最出色的人，他的举止优雅而富有魅力，无人能及。他迷住了所有值得迷住的人，也迷住了许许多多不值得迷住的人。他十分任性，而且脾气暴躁，而我过去也认为他过于虚伪。我想这主要是因为他对于享乐从无节制。可怜的西里尔！有一次，我说他只是满足于一些非常廉价的胜利，而他也只是哈哈一笑。令人感到可怕的是，他被宠坏了。我想，所有迷人的人都是被宠坏的人。这正是他们吸引人的秘密之所在。

“不过，我必须给你讲一下西里尔表演方面的事儿。你知道，女演员不被允许在业余戏剧俱乐部演出，至少在我那个时代不行。我不知道现在是怎么回事。嗯，当然，西里尔总是扮演女角。当《皆大欢喜》[3]演出的时候，他扮演罗莎琳德。这是一次了不起的表演。实际上，西里尔·格雷厄姆是我见过的唯一完美的罗莎琳德。他所扮演的角色美丽、精致而优雅，完全难以描述。这在当时引起了巨大的轰动，剧场极小，每天晚上都挤得水泄不通。即使现在看这个剧本，我也会情不自禁地想起西里尔。这个剧本或许正是为他写的。到了下一学期，他拿到了学位，来到伦敦攻读外交学。可是，他从来没做过任何功课，白天读莎士比亚的十四行诗，晚上泡在剧院里。当然，他发疯似的想登台表演。我和克雷迪顿勋爵所能做的就是阻止他。如果他当初成了演员，也许现在还会活着。劝告始终是一个愚蠢之举，而良言相劝绝对能致人死命。我希望你永远不要犯那种错误。如果那样做了，你将会为此感到后悔。

“好了，言归正传。有一天，我收到了西里尔的一封信，请我当晚到他的住所去。他在皮卡迪利大街租了一套能俯瞰格林公园[4]的很棒的住所。当时我每天都去看他，因此对他特意写信邀请感到非常惊讶。当然，我还是去了。到达后，我发现他处于一种万分激动的状态。他告诉我说，他终于发现了《莎士比亚十四行诗集》的真正奥秘，所有的学者和评论家都完全走错了路，而他纯粹通过内文证据，第一个发现了W.H.先生究竟是谁。他欣喜若狂，迟迟不愿给我讲他的理论。最后，他拿出一捆笔记，从壁炉架上取下他那本《莎士比亚十四行诗集》，坐下来给我滔滔不绝地讲起了整个论题。

“他首先指出，既然莎士比亚给这个年轻人写了这些不可思议、充满激情的诗歌，那么这个年轻人一定曾是他戏剧艺术生涯里一个至关重要的人，这个人既不是彭布罗克勋爵，也不是南安普敦勋爵。事实上，不管他是谁，他都不可能是出身高贵的人，因为第二十五首十四行诗非常清楚地说明了这一点。在这首诗里，莎士比亚把自己跟那些‘大公的宠臣’进行对比，说得相当坦率：





就让那些吉星高照的人们，

夸耀公众荣誉和得意称号，

命运拒绝给我胜利的欢欣，

而我却最崇尚意外的开心。





他自得并热爱这一卑微的身份，并以下列诗句收尾：





那么，爱与被爱，我都很幸福，

我在此既不愿迁升也不会被黜。





西里尔宣称，如果我们设想这首十四行诗是写给彭布罗克伯爵或南安普敦伯爵的，这就会让人百思不解，因为两人在英格兰都是地位崇高的人，完全有资格被称为‘大公’。在佐证自己观点的时候，他给我念了第一百二十四首和第一百二十五首十四行诗。在这些诗里，莎士比亚告诉我们，他的爱不是‘权势的子孙’，‘并未在微笑的浮华中遭罪’，而是‘绝非产生于偶然’。我兴致勃勃地倾听着，因为我认为这一点以前从来没有人提起过。可是，随之而来的更加稀奇，关于诗中对象是彭布罗克勋爵的论断几乎被完全驳倒了。我们从米尔斯那里知道，莎士比亚的十四行诗是一五九八年前写的，第一百零四首十四行诗告诉我们，莎士比亚同W.H.先生的友谊已经存在三年了。而出生于一五八〇年的彭布罗克勋爵，直到十八岁才来到伦敦，也就是到一五九八年。莎士比亚与W.H.先生的相识一定开始于一五九四年，或者最晚在一五九五年。因此，莎士比亚与彭布罗克勋爵相识，必然是写完这些十四行诗后的事情。

“西里尔还指出，彭布罗克的父亲直到一六〇一年才去世，而从这行诗，





你有过父亲，让你儿子这样说，





显而易见，在一五九八年，W.H.先生的父亲已死。此外，卷首语出自出版商之手，我们绝不能荒唐地想象，有哪个出版商敢于把彭布罗克的伯爵威廉赫·伯特称为W.H.先生。巴克赫斯特勋爵被说成萨克维尔先生的例子其实不能与之相提并论，因为巴克赫斯特勋爵不是贵族，而仅仅是贵族的小儿子，勋爵对于他是礼节上的尊称，尽管《英格兰诗坛》的文章如此提到了他，但那并不是庄严正式的献词，仅仅是随意提及。到目前为止，就在我惊讶地坐在一旁时，彭布罗克勋爵可能是W.H.先生的种种假设，都被西里尔轻而易举地一一驳倒了。至于南安普敦勋爵，西里尔论证的困难就更少了。南安普敦年纪轻轻就成了伊丽莎白·弗农的情人，所以不用别人来劝他结婚。他不漂亮，不像自己的母亲，W.H.先生则像：





你是母亲的镜子，她在你身上

唤回了风华正茂时的四月芬芳；[5]





而且，最重要的是，南安普敦的教名是‘亨利’，而那两首一语双关的十四行诗（第一百三十五首和第一百四十三首）表明，莎士比亚那位朋友的教名跟他本人的一样——也是‘威尔’。

“至于一些倒霉的评论者的其他看法——‘W.H.先生’被误印成了‘W.S.先生’，‘W.S.先生’的意思就是‘威廉·莎士比亚’（William Shakespeare）先生；‘W.H. all先生’应该读为‘W. Hall先生’; ‘W.H.先生’就是‘威廉·哈撒韦（William Hathaway）先生’；句号应该放在“wisheth”这个词后面，‘W.H.先生’应该是作者，而不应该是献词的对象——西里尔眨眼间就否定了它们。他的理由不必提，不过我还记得，他当时给我念了一位名叫巴恩斯托夫的德国评论者的文章节选，引得我一阵大笑，我很庆幸自己听到的不是德语原文。巴恩斯托夫坚持认为，W.H.先生不是别人，正是‘威廉先生自己（Mr. William Himself）’。他也绝不相信，莎士比亚的十四行诗仅仅是针对德雷顿[6]和赫里福德的约翰·戴维斯的作品的讽刺诗集。在他看来，其实我也这样看，十四行诗是具有严肃的悲剧含义的诗歌，是从莎士比亚的心里榨出的苦汁，并因他的嘴唇之蜜而变得甜美。他更不愿承认它们仅仅是一种哲学寓言，也不愿承认莎士比亚是针对理想自我、理想男性、美的精神、理性、神圣理法或天主教会而写下这一切。他所感到的，我认为我们事实上都有同感，莎士比亚的十四行诗是为个人写的——是为某个人格魅力似乎已经以极度的喜悦和极度的绝望充满了莎士比亚的灵魂的年轻人而写的。

“可以说，西里尔以这种方式扫清了道路，让我从脑海里排除了我对这个问题抱有的其他看法，不偏不倚地倾听着他自己的理论。他指出，问题是莎士比亚时代的那个年轻人是谁。他没有高贵的出身，甚至没有高贵的本性，莎士比亚却因他而激情澎湃，我们只能对这种莫名的崇拜感到惊奇，几乎不敢去转动打开诗人心灵之谜的钥匙。他的身体是如此之美，居然成了莎士比亚的艺术基石、灵感之源、梦想的化身。他到底是谁呢？如果把他仅仅看成情诗对象，就会错失这些诗的全部意义：莎士比亚在十四行诗里所谈论的艺术并不是十四行诗本身。实际上，十四行诗对他来说不过是秘不可宣的雕虫小技——他始终暗指的都是剧作家的艺术，莎士比亚对他说道：





你就是我所有的一切的艺术，

把我的愚笨升到学问的高度，[7]





他对那个年轻人许下了不朽之名，





气息最旺处其实在人们嘴里，[8]





这肯定不是别人，正是那个小演员，莎士比亚为他创作了维奥拉和伊莫金、朱丽叶和罗莎琳德、波西娅和苔丝狄蒙娜，以及克娄巴特拉。这就是西里尔·格雷厄姆的理论，你明白，纯粹是从那些十四行诗本身推断出来的，它是否被人接受，不大依靠显而易见的证明或正式的证据，而是依靠一种精神和艺术的感受。他声称，只有通过这种感受，才能领悟这些诗的真正意义。我还记得他当时给我念了那首优美的十四行诗——





我的诗神怎能缺乏创作主题？

你还呼吸时，把甜美的论点

倾入我的诗，那是多么精彩，

每一个俗笔都难以这样复述。

噢，如果我的诗里有何东西，

值得你细看，那要感谢自己；

你自己主动献出了创作灵感，

谁会那么笨，不去写诗给你？

你是第十位诗神，比前九位，

你的价值要更重十倍还多；

谁要向你呼吁，就让他写出，

流传久远的一行行不朽诗篇[9]……





并指出这首诗如何完全证实了他的理论。而实际上，他仔细查看了所有的十四行诗，以此表明或自以为表明，根据他对诗意的新解，一些曾经显得晦涩、邪恶或夸张的东西变得清晰而具有理性，富有极高的艺术内涵，阐明了莎士比亚关于演员的艺术和剧作家的艺术之间真正关系的理念。

“当然，显而易见，莎士比亚的剧团里一定有一个倾国倾城的绝妙小演员，莎士比亚托付他来表演自己创作的那些高贵的女主角，因为莎士比亚不仅是一个富有想象力的诗人，还是一位注重实际的剧院经理。西里尔·格雷厄姆实际上已经发现了小演员的名字。他就是威尔，或者像他喜欢叫的那样——威利·休斯。当然，这个教名是他在一语双关的第一百三十五首和第一百四十三首十四行诗里发现的。按照他的说法，姓氏藏在第二十首十四行诗的第七行，莎士比亚在这里把W.H.先生描述为：





绝色（hew)男子，所有美色（Hews）由他掌控。[10]





“在《莎士比亚十四行诗集》的原版中，‘Hews’用大写字母和斜体印刷，他声称，这一点清楚地表明作者是在有意地进行文字游戏，他的观点从那些十四行诗中得到了大量佐证，因为在这些诗中，‘use’和‘usury’[11]使用了古怪的双关语。当然，我马上接受了这个观点。在我看来，威利·休斯成了像莎士比亚一样真实的人。我对这个理论提出的唯一反对意见就是，第一批开本印刷的时候，威利·休斯的名字并没有出现在莎士比亚剧团的演员名单当中。不过，西里尔指出，威利·休斯的名字不在这个名单里，恰恰证实了这个理论，因为第八十六首十四行诗清楚地表明，威利·休斯已经放弃了莎士比亚的剧团，到了一家竞争对手的剧团，大概是要在查普曼[12]的某部戏剧中演出。关于这一点，莎士比亚在针对查普曼的伟大十四行诗中对威利·休斯说道：





但当你的面容充满他的诗行，

我就会缺乏灵感，羸弱而心慌[13]……





‘当你的面容充满他的诗行’这种诗句显然是指年轻演员的美貌给查普曼的诗句赋予了生命和真实，并为其增添了魅力，同样的思想也在第七十九首十四行诗里提出——





当我独自恳求你援助之际，

我的诗独享你所有的妩媚；

但现在我的雅致渐渐衰退，

我的病诗神得给他人让位；[14]





在紧接前面的那首十四行诗里，莎士比亚说：





每支陌生的笔采用我的手法，

在你名下把他们的诗歌播撒，[15]





文字游戏当然一目了然，而那句‘在你名下把他们的诗歌播撒’，意思是：‘通过你这个演员的协助，才能把戏剧展示在众人面前。’

“这是一个美妙的夜晚，我们一遍又一遍地诵读《莎士比亚十四行诗集》，差不多熬到了天亮。然而，过了一段时间，我开始明白，在将这个理论以真正完美的形式展示在世人面前之前，有必要得到这位年轻演员威利·休斯存在的某个独立证据。这个论点一旦成立，无疑可以说他就是W.H.先生了；如若不然，这个理论必将落空。我措辞激烈地向西里尔提出了这一点，他认为我思想庸俗并且大为恼火，语气有些尖刻。不过，我还是让他保证，为了自己的利益，他要让整个事情没有任何疑问，才能把自己的发现公之于众。我们周复一周地查究市里各个教堂的登记簿，德威公学的阿莱恩手稿，档案局、宫务大臣的文件——实际上，我们认为有可能提及威利·休斯的一切材料。当然，我们什么也没有发现，在我看来，关于威利·休斯存在的事实性，似乎每天都有越来越多的疑问。西里尔处于一种可怕的状态，常常日复一日地仔细检查整个问题，恳求我相信；但是，我看到了这个理论当中的一个缺陷，所以就不再心悦诚服，除非能确凿无疑地证明伊丽莎白一世时期确实真的存在威利·休斯这个小演员。

“有一天西里尔离城，我当时以为他去跟他的外祖父待在一起，但我后来听克雷迪顿勋爵说情况并非如此。大约两个星期之后，我收到了他从沃里克发来的一份电报，请我一定要在当天晚上八点钟过去跟他一起吃饭。我到达后，他对我说道：‘唯一不该得到证明的使徒是圣·托马斯，圣·托马斯却又是唯一得到证明的使徒。’我问他此话何意。他回答说，他不仅能够证明十六世纪确实有一个名叫威利·休斯的小演员，而且能通过最确凿的证据证明他就是十四行诗里的W.H.先生。他当时不愿再多告诉我什么，但晚饭后，他郑重其事地拿出了那幅我让你看过的画像，告诉我说，他完全是碰巧发现的，他在沃里克郡的一个农家买了一口旧箱子，那幅画像就钉在箱子的侧面。箱子本身是伊丽莎白女王一世时期精湛工艺的典范，他当然随身带着箱子，正面箱板中央确定无疑地刻着首字母W.H.。吸引他注意的正是这个组合字母，他告诉我说，直到买了这口箱子好几天后，他才想起仔细检查一下箱子里面。然而，一天早上，他看到箱子的一侧比另一侧厚得多，就更加仔细地查看，发现较厚的一侧钉着一幅带框的木板画。他把画取了出来，就是现在躺在沙发上的那幅画。那幅画脏兮兮的，霉迹斑斑，但他还是设法把它擦干净了，而且让他大为高兴的是，他歪打正着地发现了自己一直在寻找的东西。这就是W.H.先生的正宗画像，W.H.先生的一只手按在《莎士比亚十四行诗集》献词的页面上，框架上依稀可见用黑色安色尔字体在褪色的金色背景上写的那个年轻人的名字——“威尔·休斯先生”。

“好吧，我该怎么说呢？我从来没有想过西里尔·格雷厄姆是在捉弄我，也从来没有想到他会设法通过伪造来证明他的理论。”

“可它是伪造的吗？”我问。

“当然是，”厄斯金说，“这是一个以假乱真的伪造品，不过终究还是一个伪造品。我当时认为西里尔对整个事情表现得颇为平静，我还记得他不止一次对我说，他自己不需要这类证据，他认为没有这类证据这个理论也是完整的。我嘲笑他，并告诉他说，没有这类证据，这个理论就会落空，我热烈祝贺他有了这个惊人的发现。然后，我们协商决定，要把这幅画蚀刻或临摹，并作为西里尔版《十四行诗集》的卷首插画。连续三个月，我们都在一行一行地仔细检查每一首诗，直到我们解决了文本或诗意的每一处难点。一个晦气的日子，我在霍尔本的一家印刷店看到柜台上摆着一些极其漂亮的银笔素描。它们是那样吸引我，我就买了下来。店主是一个名叫罗林斯的人，他告诉我说，这些画是一个名叫爱德华·默顿的年轻画家画的，这个年轻画家聪明过人，但一贫如洗。我从版画商那里要来了默顿的地址，几天后就去拜见了他。他是一个脸色苍白、饶有风趣的年轻人，他的妻子长相颇为普通——我后来得知那是他的模特。我告诉他我是多么欣赏他的画，他对此显得非常高兴。我问他愿不愿意给我看一下他的其他一些作品。于是，我们就翻看起了一个作品集，里面的确都是非常好看的东西——因为默顿的笔法精致完臻、赏心悦目——这时，我突然瞥见了一幅W.H.先生的画像素描。这一点毫无疑问，几乎是一个摹本——唯一的区别是，那两个代表悲剧与喜剧的面具不是画像里那样从大理石桌上悬挂下来，而是躺在这个年轻人脚边的地板上。‘你是从哪里弄来这个的？’我问。他变得有些困惑，说道：‘噢，那没什么。我不知道它在这个集子里。这是一件没有任何价值的东西。’‘这是你为西里尔·格雷厄姆画的啊，’他的妻子大声说道，‘这位先生想买，就让他买走吧。’‘为西里尔·格雷厄姆先生画的？’我又问道，‘是你画的W.H.先生的画像？’‘我不明白你是什么意思。’他脸色通红地回答说。唉，整个事情糟透了。他的妻子把这一切都给抖了出来。我临走的时候给了她五英镑。我当时怒不可遏，现在想起这件事还是受不了。我马上去了西里尔的住处，在那里等了三个小时，那个可怕的谎言一直盯着我的脸。他回来后，我告诉他我已经发现了他的伪造品。他的脸色一下子变得煞白，说道：‘我这样做，纯粹是为你着想。任何别的方式，你都不会信服。它不影响这个理论的真实性。’‘理论的真实性！’我大声嚷道，‘这我们还是少说为好。连你自己都从来没有相信过这一点。如果你相信的话，就不会弄虚作假来证明了。’我们之间争论激烈，发生了一场可怕的争吵。我当时说话大概有失公允。第二天早晨，他就死了。”

“死了！”我叫道。

“是的，他用左轮手枪射杀了自己。一些血飞溅到了画框上，正好落在了那个写有名字的地方。他的仆人马上派人来叫我，而等我赶到的时候，警察已经到了现场。他留给了我一封信，显然是在最烦乱、最痛苦的状态下写的。”

“信里写的是什么？”我问。

“噢，说他绝对相信威利·休斯，说伪造画像仅仅是对我做出的一种让步，丝毫无损这个理论的真实性。而且，为了向我表明他对整个事情的信念是多么坚定不移、完美无瑕，他要把自己的生命作为祭品，献给《莎士比亚十四行诗集》的这一秘密。这是一封愚蠢又疯狂的信。我还记得，他在信尾说，他把威利·休斯理论托付给我，让我把它呈现给世人，揭开莎士比亚内心之谜。”

“这是一个极其悲惨的故事，”我讲道，“但你为什么没有履行他的意愿？”

厄斯金耸了耸肩。“因为它从始到终都是一种完全站不住脚的理论。”他回答说。

“我亲爱的厄斯金，”我从座位上站起来说，“你在整个事情上完全错了。它是开启《莎士比亚十四行诗集》的唯一完美的钥匙。它每一个细节都完整。我相信威利·休斯的存在。”

“不要那样说，”厄斯金神情严肃地说，“我相信这个理念有一些极其错误的东西，没有丝毫理性。我曾经探究过整个事情，而且可以向你保证这个理论是完全靠不住的。它在某种程度上貌似有理，然后就此打住。看在上帝的分上，我亲爱的孩子，不要研究威利·休斯这个话题了。你会为此伤心的。”

“厄斯金，”我回答说，“把这个理论推向世界，是你的职责。如果你不这样做，我就会去做。如果你隐瞒，你就会辱没西里尔·格雷厄姆的英名，他是文学的所有殉道者中最年轻、最出色的一位。我恳求公正地对待他。他是为这件事而死的——不要让他白死啊。”

厄斯金惊讶地看着我。“你被这个故事冲昏了头脑，”他说，“你忘了一个人为一件事而死，这件事未必就是真实的。我过去对西里尔·格雷厄姆忠心耿耿。他的死对我是一个可怕的打击。我好几年都没有恢复过来。我认为我永远都恢复不过来。可是，威利·休斯呢？威利·休斯的理念一文不值。没有这样的人曾经存在过。至于把整个事情摆在世人面前——世人会认为西里尔·格雷厄姆是意外射杀了自己。他自杀的唯一证据是给我的那封信，而公众从未听说过这封信。直到今天，克雷迪顿勋爵都认为整个事情是一次意外。”

“西里尔·格雷厄姆把自己的生命献给了一个伟大的思想，”我回答说，“如果你不愿讲述他的殉道，那就至少讲述一下他的信念。”

“他的信念，”厄斯金说，“植根于一件虚假的东西，植根于一件靠不住的东西，植根于一件所有莎士比亚学者都丝毫不愿接受的东西。这个理论将会被嘲笑。不要让自己出丑，走一条行不通的小路。你一开始就假设那个人的存在，而那个人的存在却是有待证明的事情。此外，每个人都知道这些十四行诗是写给彭布罗克勋爵的。这件事已经有定论了。”

“这件事没有定论！”我大声叫道，“我会从西里尔·格雷厄姆遗留的这个理论开始研究，还会向世人证明他是对的。”

“傻孩子！”厄斯金说，“回家吧，都两点多钟了，不要再想威利·休斯了。很抱歉，我对你说了这件事，真正抱歉的是我竟然使你相信了我都不相信的事情。”

“你已经送给了我打开现代文学最伟大的奥秘的钥匙，”我回答说，“不让你认可，让大家都认可西里尔·格雷厄姆是我们时代最敏锐的莎士比亚批评家，我不会善罢甘休。”

当我穿过圣·詹姆斯公园走回家的时候，伦敦上空刚刚破晓。白天鹅在澄亮的湖面上睡觉，荒凉的宫殿在淡绿色天空的映衬下呈现出紫色。我想起了西里尔·格雷厄姆，眼里顿时涌满了泪水。





第二章


我醒来的时候已经过了中午十二点，太阳光像长长的，裹挟着尘土的金柱，透过窗帘，照进我的房间。我对仆人说，我在家里不会见任何人。喝了一杯巧克力、吃了一个早餐面包[16]后，我从书架上拿下我那本《莎士比亚十四行诗集》，开始仔细审阅起来。在我看来，每一首诗似乎都能证实西里尔·格雷厄姆的理论。我觉得好像我把一只手放在了莎士比亚的心上，并在数着激情的每一次悸动和脉跳。我想起了那个令人赞叹的小演员，在每一行诗句里都看到了他的脸庞。

我还记得，有两首十四行诗给我留下了特别深刻的印象：它们是第五十三首和第六十七首。在前一首里，莎士比亚称赞威利·休斯全面的演技，称赞他从罗莎琳德到朱丽叶，从比阿特丽斯到奥菲莉亚，扮演了范围宽广的角色，对他说道：





你的本质是什么，你由何构成，

无数奇异的影子纷纷把你推崇？

人人都是这样，每人有一个影，

除了一个影，你还能增各种影[17]……





如果这首诗不是写给演员的，这些诗行就会难以理解，因为在莎士比亚时代，“影子”这个词有跟舞台相关的一种专门含义。“这种戏里最好的就是影子。”忒修斯这样评说《仲夏夜之梦》里的演员，而且同时代的文学作品中也有许多类似的比喻。这些十四行诗显然属于这类，莎士比亚在诗句中讨论了演员的艺术本质，以及完美的舞台演员必不可少的那种奇异而罕见的气质。“你是怎么，”莎士比亚对威利·休斯说，“拥有这么多个性的呢？”随后，他接着指出，休斯的美如此出众，似乎把想象的各种形式和阶段都变成了现实，将充满创造性想象力的每一个梦具象化——这种理念在紧接着的那首十四行诗里得到了进一步扩展，它以如此美好的思想开始：





噢，真实要是赋予了甜美装潢，

美似乎就会增光添彩，美上加美！[18]





莎士比亚请我们注意演技的真实、舞台上有形展示的真实是如何增加诗的神奇，让诗的魅力赋有生命，让理想形式赋有真正的现实感。然而，在第六十七首十四行诗中，莎士比亚呼吁威利·休斯放弃舞台，放弃舞台的矫揉造作，放弃涂脂抹粉的面容和模仿的服装构成的虚假生活，放弃不道德的影响和暗示，放弃它同行为高贵、话语真诚的真实世界的疏离。





啊，为什么他活在这腐败社会，

用他的仪态来为亵渎增光添彩，

罪恶行径也依靠他来攫取利益，

以他的陪伴刻意装点美化自己？

为什么虚假脂粉仿造他的容颜，

从他逼真的色彩窃取呆板外观？

既然玫瑰是真，可怜的美何以，

还要弯来绕去寻找玫瑰的影子？[19]





像莎士比亚这么伟大的戏剧家，在戏剧创作和舞台表演的理想平面上，作为艺术家，实现了自己的完美；作为人，实现了人性。他居然以这样的术语来写戏剧，这看起来可能奇怪。但是，我们必须记住，在第一百一十首和第一百一十一首十四行诗里，莎士比亚向我们表明，他也厌倦了这个木偶的世界，对使自己成为“公众的小丑”充满了羞耻。第一百一十一首尤其苦涩：





噢，为了我，你斥责命运女神，

我的有害行为都怪这有罪女神，

除了我逢人便去卖弄当众谋生，

没有人会为我的生活好好供应。

因而，我的名字便把烙印招领，

我的本性由此便这样俯首听命，

就像染工之手，屈从工作环境：

那就可怜我，希望我获得新生[20]……





其他地方还有许多这种情绪的标志，所有真正研究莎士比亚的学者都熟悉这些标志。

我读《莎士比亚十四行诗集》的时候，有一点百思不解。几天后，我才突然明白它真正的诠释，好像西里尔·格雷厄姆本人也没有明白它的意义。我不明白莎士比亚为什么对朋友结婚期望值那么高。他自己年纪轻轻就结了婚，结果却非常不幸，他不太可能让威利·休斯犯同样的错误。扮演罗莎琳德的小演员从婚姻中和现实生活的激情中什么也得不到。在我看来，那些带有关于结婚生子的奇怪恳求的早期十四行诗，是一个不和谐的音符。神秘的解释突然产生，对我来说非常意外，我是在古怪的献词里发现的。人们一定会记住献词，内容如下：





献给下列这些十四行诗的

唯一促成者

W.H.先生。像我

不朽诗人[21]允诺的那样

万事如意幸福永久

良好祝愿

冒昧付梓者。

T.T.[22]





有些学者推断，这个献词里的“促成者”仅仅是指为出版商托马斯·索普获得《十四行诗集》的人。但是，这种观点现在被普遍摈弃了，最高权威都一致地认为这个词应该理解为“激发灵感者”，这个比喻是从物质生活的类比得来的。现在我明白了，莎士比亚本人在创作诗歌时一直使用同样的比喻，这使我走上了正路。最后，我有了重大发现。莎士比亚提议威利·休斯结婚是“与他的诗神结婚”，第八十二首诗里明确地这样表达了。他为那个小演员创作了最伟大的角色，小演员之美的确给了那些角色启发，而小演员却背叛了他，他对此内心苦涩，一开头就诉苦说：





我承认你没有嫁给我的诗神。[23]





他请求休斯生出的不是有血有肉的孩子们，而是更加永恒的孩子们，也就是不朽之名。诗集开头整个一组十四行诗[24]仅仅是莎士比亚邀请威利·休斯登上舞台，成为一名演员。他说，如果你的美丽派不上用场，那会是一件多么沉闷无趣、毫无裨益的事情：





当四十个冬天围攻你的前额，

在你美的田地挖下深深沟壑，

你的青春华服如今引人瞩目，

有朝一日会像败草不值一提：

有人到时问你的美躺在何处，

哪是你所有风华正茂的宝藏，

在你自己那双深陷的眼睛里，

是饕餮的耻辱和无益的赞扬[25]。





你必须在艺术中有所创造：我的诗“是你的，因你而生”[26]；只要听我说，我就会“写出一行行流传久远的不朽诗篇”，你则会用自己的形象在舞台上演绎想象世界中的形形色色的人。他继续说道，你的这些孩子就不会像凡人的孩子们那样消亡，你会活在他们身上，活在我的戏里：只要你：





为了我，在孩子身上复制自己，

那种美仍可活在你或孩子体内！[27]





我收集了所有在我看来能证实这个观点的篇章，它们给我留下了强烈的印象，并向我说明了西里尔·格雷厄姆的理论的确是多么完整。我也看到，莎士比亚有些诗行是在谈论十四行诗本身，有些是在谈论他的伟大戏剧作品，要区分那些诗行相当容易。在西里尔·格雷厄姆出现那天前，这是一个被所有批评者完全忽视的问题。然而，这是整个系列诗歌里最重要的一点。对于十四行诗，莎士比亚或多或少有些淡漠。他不希望自己的名声停留在这些十四行诗上面。对他来说，十四行诗是他所谓的“卑微的诗神”，因为米尔斯也告诉我们，十四行诗只有寥寥几个朋友私下传阅而已。另一方面，他特别在意自己的戏剧作品的巨大的艺术价值，并对自己的戏剧天分流露出了一种高贵的自恃。当他对威利·休斯说起：





但是，你的长夏不会黯淡无光，

也不会失去你靓丽优美的形象；

死神夸口你在他的阴影里游荡，

当你在永恒的诗行与时间成长：

只要人类能呼吸，眼睛能眺望，

永世长存，赐给你生命的光芒；[28]——





“永恒的诗行”这个措辞显然是暗指他当时送给休斯的其中一部戏剧，同样，最后两句表明他相信自己的戏剧有可能经久不衰地演下去。在他写给戏剧缪斯（第一百首和第一百零一首）的十四行诗中，我们发现了同样的情绪。





诗神啊，你在哪里，久久忘记，

去说起佳人赋予你的所有力量？

你在毫无价值的歌上浪掷诗意，

屈尊你的力量给卑微主题借光？[29]





他大声叫喊，然后继续责备悲剧和喜剧的情人，责备她“疏忽浸染于美好的纯真[30]”，说道：





他不需要赞美，你就装聋作哑？

别为沉默找借口，你有能力啊，

使他比镀金的坟墓活得更久长，

会受到世世代代一致纷纷赞扬。

诗神尽你的职责，我教你怎样，

使他从此像现在这样一如既往[31]。





然而，也许在第五十五首十四行诗里，莎士比亚才对这个理念进行了最充分的表述。如果想象第二行的“雄浑韵律”指的是十四行诗本身，那就完全误解了莎士比亚的意思。在我看来，从十四行诗的共性来看，“雄浑韵律”极有可能是指一部特定的戏剧，这部戏剧不是别的，正是《罗密欧与朱丽叶》。





无论大理石还是王公的镀金碑，

都活不过这种雄浑博大的韵律；

但你将永远闪耀在这些诗篇里，

胜过那些懒惰时光涂脏的石头。

当挥霍的战争将要去推翻铜像，

战火也会连根拔起铁壁和铜墙，

无论是战神利剑还是战争烈焰，

都烧不掉你记忆里的鲜活记录。

面对死亡和湮没这一切的怨仇，

你阔步向前；即使在后世的眼里，

你的赞美也将会找到一席之地，

耗尽这个世界，直到最后末日。

所以直到最后审判你自己站起，

你活在诗里，住在恋人的眼里。





这同样特别发人深省，注意这里和其他地方一样，莎士比亚向威利·休斯承诺的不朽是一种引人注目的形式——也就是说，是一种引人入胜的形式，是一种供人观看的戏剧。

连续两个星期，我努力研读十四行诗，几乎足不出户，谢绝了所有邀请。我似乎每天都能发现新东西，威利·休斯对我来说成了一种精神存在，一种永远占主导地位的人格魅力。我几乎可以在想象中看到他站在我房间的阴影里，莎士比亚把他描绘得是那么出色：他一头金发，花朵般温柔优雅，梦幻般的深眼窝，柔和灵动的四肢，还有白百合般的双手。就连他的名字都让我心醉神迷。威利·休斯！威利·休斯！它是多么悦耳动听啊！是的，除了他，还有谁可能成为莎士比亚最衷爱的“情妇”，[32]成为他臣服的爱情上帝，[33]成为快乐的柔弱宠臣，[34]成为全世界的玫瑰，[35]成为春天的信使[36]，身穿青春华服[37]，成为那个倾听甜美音乐的可爱男孩[38]，他的美就是莎士比亚心灵的衣裳，[39]因为这是他的戏剧力量的基石。现在由他的背叛和羞耻产生的整个悲剧似乎是那么苦涩！——仅仅通过他个性的魔力，他把耻辱变得甜美可爱[40]，但这毕竟还是耻辱。然而，莎士比亚原谅了他，我们不也应该原谅他吗？我不喜欢窥探他罪恶的秘密。他对莎士比亚剧院的背叛是另一回事，我极其详细地调查了这一点。最后，我得出结论，西里尔·格雷厄姆错误地认为第八十首十四行诗的剧坛对手是查普曼。这首诗显然暗指的是马洛[41]。在写作这些十四行诗的这段时间里，“他雄浑的诗行的傲然扬帆”[42]这样的表达不可能适用于查普曼的作品，无论它可能多么适用于他后来在詹姆斯一世时期的戏剧风格。不，莎士比亚以如此赞美的措辞谈论的剧坛对手显然是马洛，而且：





那个和蔼可亲的幽灵，

每天夜里用机智骗他，[43]





指的是他的《浮士德博士》里的梅菲斯特。毫无疑问，马洛被这个小演员的美丽与风度迷住了，并引诱他离开了黑衣修士剧院，这样小演员可能在他的《爱德华二世》中扮演了盖文斯顿。显然，从第八十七首十四行诗来看，莎士比亚有合法的权利把威利·休斯留在自己的剧团，他说：





再见！你金贵我高攀不起，

你充分地知道自己的价值：

你的价值赋予你特权自由；

我对你的盟约都已经终止。

没有你的恩准我如何留你？

我哪有福分得到那种宝藏？

我没有理由接受公平礼物，

我的专利权还是物归原主。

你不知自己宝贵以身相许，

否则你就错看了受赐的我；

因此你的厚礼是出于误会，

经过明断，就要重新还归。

我曾拥有你，像一场美梦，

梦里权称王，醒来万事无。





但是，用爱留不住的人，他也不愿用武力留住。威利·休斯成为彭布罗克剧团的一员，而且有可能在红牛酒馆的露天场地扮演了爱德华国王的幸臣这一角色。马洛去世后，休斯似乎又回到了莎士比亚身边，不管合作伙伴对这件事可能有什么想法，莎士比亚马上就原谅了这个年轻演员的任性与背叛。

此外，莎士比亚对舞台演员的气质刻画得是多么出色！威利·休斯是其中之一。





他们不去做自己最爱做的事，

他们感动别人自己却如磐石。[44]





他可以演绎爱情，却感觉不到爱情；可以模仿激情，却意识不到激情。





许多人虚情假意的种种经历，

露在蹙眉皱纹的莫名情绪里。[45]





但是，威利·休斯并不是这样。“上苍，”莎士比亚在一首洋溢着疯狂的偶像崇拜的十四行诗里说：





上苍在创造你之时便已注定，

甜爱要永远地留在你的脸上；

无论思想还是心里如何嬗变，

你的容貌从此只会诉说甜美。[46]





从他的“见异思迁”和“虚情假意”中，不难看出伪善和背叛，不知何故，似乎这跟艺术本质密不可分，因为他喜欢得到赞扬，渴望马上得到认可，表现出了所有演员的特征。然而，威利·休斯在这方面比其他演员更幸运，他了解不朽的东西。他跟莎士比亚的戏剧密不可分，所以会活在其中。





你的名字从此将会永垂不朽，

一旦离去，我定会隔绝人世：

大地只能给我一座普通坟墓，

你将会埋葬在人们的眼睛里。

我的温柔诗行将是你的丰碑，

当所有世人都纷纷撒手而去，

未来的眼睛一定会前后通读，

未来的舌头也会把你来传递。[47]





此外，莎士比亚无数次地提到了威利·休斯征服观众的威力——莎士比亚称观众们为“仰慕者”。但是，也许关于休斯对戏剧艺术的精通最完美的描述莫过于《情女怨》[48]。在这首诗里，莎士比亚是这样叙说他的：





他心里有许多巧妙招数，

千姿又百态故弄又玄虚，

脸红如火，或泪水长流，

苍白眩晕；他得手就走，

骗人天衣无缝得心应手，

听粗话脸红闻不幸哭泣，

见惨景脸色煞白倒在地。[49]

因此，在他如簧的舌尖上，

各种各样争论和深刻问题，

所有随即应答和有力推断，

无论醒来睡着都对他有利，

能让哭者笑，能让笑者哭。

各种行话和技巧应有尽有，

他随心所欲虏获所有激情。[50]





有一次，我认为，我真的已经在伊丽莎白一世时代的文献里找到了威利·休斯。在对埃塞克斯郡大伯爵最后日子的精彩生动的叙述里，他的私人牧师托马斯·奈尔告诉我们说，伯爵去世前一天晚上，“他吩咐乐师威廉·休斯一边弹奏维金纳琴[51]一边歌唱。‘威尔·休斯，’他说，‘弹我那首歌，我要唱给自己听。’于是，他兴高采烈地唱了起来，不像是依然低头悲鸣末日来临的天鹅，而像是一只歌声悦耳的云雀，只见他举起双手，抬眼望着上帝，就这样升上了水晶般透明的天空，并跟他不倦的舌头一样到达了最高的天顶。”当然，那个对西德尼之星的垂死父亲弹维金纳琴的男孩不是别人，正是莎士比亚题献十四行诗的威尔·休斯。莎士比亚告诉我们说，休斯本身听起来就是甜美的音乐。然而，埃塞克斯勋爵一五七六年去世，当时莎士比亚本人才十二岁。他的乐师不可能是《莎士比亚十四行诗集》里的W.H.先生。莎士比亚的年轻朋友可能会是维金纳琴师的儿子吗？这至少已经发现威尔·休斯是伊丽莎白一世时期的一个名字。实际上，“休斯”这个名字似乎曾经跟音乐和舞台密切相关。英国第一个女演员是可爱的玛格丽特·休斯，鲁珀特王子如此疯狂地爱上了她。在她和埃塞克斯勋爵的乐师之间出现了那个表演莎士比亚戏剧的小演员，这有什么不可能的呢？但是，那些证据、那些环节——它们在哪里呢？唉！我找不到它们。在我看来，我总是处在完全确认的边缘，却从来没有真正到达过那里。

从威利·休斯的生活，我很快就想到了他的死亡。我过去常常想知道他是什么样的结局。

也许他曾经跟那些英国演员一起，于一六〇四年漂洋过海前往德国，在不伦瑞克[52]的亨利·尤里乌斯[53]大公面前表演，大公本人也是一位非常出色的剧作家。他们还在勃兰登堡那个奇怪的选帝侯宫演出，这个选帝侯非常迷恋美人，据说他曾经用相当于他体重的琥珀买下了希腊客商的小儿子；为了表彰他的奴仆，还在一六〇六到一六〇七那个可怕的饥荒年举行了一些盛会，这时他的子民纷纷饿死在城市的大街上，因为七个月都没有下一滴雨。我们知道，不管怎样，一六一三年《罗密欧与朱丽叶》《哈姆雷特》和《李尔王》一起在德累斯顿上演；一六一五年，经英国大使的一位随员之手，把莎士比亚的遗容面模带去交给的肯定不是别人，正是威利·休斯，这是逝去的伟大诗人深爱他的凭证。实际上，一定会有特别符合这种观点的一些东西：这个小演员的美是莎士比亚艺术的现实主义和浪漫情怀中至关重要的元素，应该是他第一个把新文化的种子带到了德国，并以自己的方式成为十八世纪启蒙运动[54]的先驱，尽管那次辉煌的运动是由莱辛[55]和赫尔德[56]开创的，并由歌德推向了充分而又完美的顶点，同时也得到了另一位演员——弗里德里希·施罗德[57]——的大力帮助。弗里德里希·施罗德唤醒了大众意识，并通过舞台上的假装激情和模仿手段表现生活与文学之间亲密无间、至关重要的联系。如果是这样——当然还没有任何反对的证据——威利·休斯是那些英国喜剧演员之一（古代编年史称他们是来自英国的演员[58]），这不是没有可能。那些英国喜剧演员在纽伦堡的一次突发的人民起义中被杀，一些年轻人把他们秘密地埋在了城外的一个小葡萄园；“这些年轻人在他们的表演中发现了乐趣，其中一些曾试图得到有关新艺术奥秘的指导。”当然，再没有什么地方比城墙外的这个小葡萄园更适合威尔·休斯了，莎士比亚曾经对他说过：“你是我所有的艺术。”难道悲剧不是源于狄奥尼索斯[59]的种种悲伤吗？难道带着无忧无虑的快乐和随机应答的喜剧的轻松笑声，不是首先从西西里葡萄园丁的嘴里听到的吗？不仅如此，而且人们脸上和四肢上留下的葡萄酒泡沫的紫红印迹，不是也首先暗示了伪装的种种魅力——对自我隐藏的欲望，对客观现实的价值感——从而自动地呈现在了艺术的原始开端之中吗？不管怎样，无论他躺在哪里——无论是在哥特城门口的小葡萄园，还是在我们大城市伦敦喧嚣忙乱中的某个昏暗墓地——都没有壮丽的丰碑标明他的安身之处。正如莎士比亚预见的那样，他真正的墓地是诗人的诗行，他真正的纪念碑是戏剧的永恒魅力。其他人也曾如此，这些人以自身的美给予了他的时代一个崭新的、创造性的推动。那个俾泰尼亚奴仆[60]象牙般的躯体在尼罗河的绿色软泥中腐烂，那个雅典青年[61]的骨灰撒落在克拉美库斯[62]的黄色山丘上。但是，安提诺乌斯[63]活在雕塑里，卡尔米德[64]则活在哲学里。





第三章


三个星期后，我决心向厄斯金强烈呼吁：要公正地纪念西里尔·格雷厄姆，并向世人公布他对《莎士比亚十四行诗集》的精彩解读——唯一一个对这个问题进行了全面说明的解读。我给厄斯金写了一封信。我遗憾地说，我没有我那封信的任何副本，也没有能拿到原件。但是，我还记得我当时把整个问题回顾了一遍，在满满几页纸上充满热情地重述了我研究得来的那些论点和证据。在我看来，我不仅仅是要把西里尔·格雷厄姆恢复到他在文学史上应有的地位，而且是要挽救莎士比亚本人的荣誉，以免人们以为那些十四行诗只是单调乏味地回忆一段司空见惯的私情。我把所有的热情都投入了这封信。我把所有的信念都投入了这封信。

其实，我刚把这封信寄走，一种奇异的感应就向我袭来。在我看来，我已经放弃了我对《莎士比亚十四行诗集》威利·休斯理论的所有信念，好像什么东西已经离我而去，所以我对整个主题都完全无动于衷。到底发生了什么事呢？这很难说。也许通过寻找完美地宣泄激情的方式，我已经用尽了激情本身。情感的力量，就像物质生活的力量一样，有其确定的局限性。也许原因在于，仅仅通过努力使任何一个人转而相信一种理论，就意味着劝说者要在某种程度上放弃相信的能力。也许我完全厌倦了整个事情，而且我的热情已经燃尽了，我的理性只能依赖其自身的冷静判断。无论发生怎样的变化，我都无法妄加解释，威利·休斯对我来说突然变成了一个纯粹的神话、一场无聊的梦想，变成了一个年轻人幼稚的幻想，这个年轻人像大多数热情的人一样，更渴望说服别人，而不是说服自己。

因为我在信里说了一些对厄斯金很不公平的刻薄话，所以我马上决定去看看他，为自己的行为向他道歉。于是，第二天早上，我坐车去了鸟笼道，发现厄斯金坐在他的书房里，威利·休斯的伪造肖像立在他面前。

“我亲爱的厄斯金！”我叫道，“我是来向你道歉的。”

“向我道歉？”他问，“为什么道歉？”

“为我的信道歉。”我答道。

“你在信里没有什么可道歉的，”他说，“恰恰相反，你在力所能及的范围内帮了我一个最大的忙。你已经向我表明，西里尔·格雷厄姆的理论是完全合理的。”

“你不是说你相信威利·休斯吧？”我大声问道。

“为什么不相信呢？”他答道，“你已经向我证明了那件事。你以为我判断不了证据的价值吗？”

“可是，根本没有任何证据。”我一屁股坐在椅子上抱怨道，“我给你写信的时候，是受到了愚蠢透顶的热情的影响。我已经被西里尔·格雷厄姆去世的故事打动了，被他的浪漫理论陶醉了，被整个理念的新奇迷住了。我现在明白，那个理论是基于一种错觉。威利·休斯存在的唯一证据就是你面前的那幅肖像，而且肖像是伪造的。在这件事上不要被纯粹的感情冲昏了头脑。无论浪漫情怀对有关威利·休斯的理论有多么新奇的感受，理性都是坚决反对的。”

“我不明白你的意思。”厄斯金惊讶地看着我说，“哎呀，是你自己通过那封信已经使我确信威利·休斯是绝对真实的。你为什么改变了主意？要么说，你之前对我说的所有一切，只是一个玩笑？”

“我无法给你解释，”我回应说，“但我现在明白西里尔·格雷厄姆所做出的解读实在没有什么可赞同的。《莎士比亚十四行诗集》是写给彭布罗克勋爵的。看在上帝的分上，不要浪费时间犯傻去试图发现伊丽莎白一世时期一个从不存在的年轻演员，让一个幽灵木偶成为《莎士比亚十四行诗集》伟大诗篇的中心。”

“我看你不明白那个理论。”他答道。

“我亲爱的厄斯金，”我喊道，“不明白！啊，我感觉它好像是我无中生有的。当然，我的信向你表明，我不仅研究了整件事，而且提供了各种证据。这种理论的一个缺陷是，它预先假定那个人的存在，而这个人的存在正是争议的话题。如果我们承认莎士比亚的剧团有一个名叫威利·休斯的年轻演员，就不难使他成为那些十四行诗的对象。可是，因为我们知道环球剧院[65]里没有这个名字的演员，所以进一步调查是无聊的。”

“不过，这正是我们不知道的，”厄斯金说，“千真万确，他的名字没有出现在第一对开本的演员名单上。然而，正如西里尔指出的那样，如果我们还记得他为了一个剧坛对手而背弃过莎士比亚的话，这就会相当有利地证明威利·休斯的存在，而不是否定。”

我们就这件事争论了几个小时，但无论我说什么，都不能使厄斯金放弃他对西里尔·格雷厄姆理论的信念。他告诉我说，他打算奉献自己的一生来证明这个理论，并下定决心以还其公正的方式来纪念西里尔·格雷厄姆。我恳求他，嘲笑他，央求他，但都无济于事。最后，我们就此分手，并不完全是满腔怒火，但我们之间肯定留下了一道阴影。他认为我浅薄，我觉得他愚蠢。当我再次拜访他的时候，仆人告诉我他已经去了德国。

两年后，我正要走进俱乐部，门房递给我一封盖有外国邮戳的信。这是厄斯金寄来的，是在戛纳的英格兰酒店写的。看过信后，尽管我不太相信他会如此疯狂地下定决心付诸行动，但我心里还是充满了恐惧。那封信的要点是，他想尽了各种办法去证实威利·休斯理论，都一一失败了，而且，由于西里尔·格雷厄姆为这个理论献出了自己的生命，因此他本人已经决定也为同样的事业献出自己的生命。信的结尾是这样写的：“我仍然相信威利·休斯。当你收到这封信的时候，我应该早已为威利·休斯亲手结束了自己的生命：既为了他，也为了西里尔·格雷厄姆。是我通过浅薄的怀疑主义和无知的信仰缺失逼死了西里尔·格雷厄姆。事实真相一度透露给你，而你却一口否定了。这件事沾有两条生命的鲜血，现在来到了你身边——不要避开。”

这是一个可怕的时刻。我因痛苦而感到恶心，但我却无法相信这一点。为某个人的神学信仰而死，是一个人对自己的生命最糟糕的利用，况且是为一个文学理论而死！这似乎说不过去。

我看了看日期。这封信是一个星期前写的。不巧的是，我好几天都没有来俱乐部，否则的话，也许我就能及时地收到信去救他。也许还不太晚。我坐车赶回自己的房间，收拾好东西，然后从查令十字车站乘夜班邮车启程。旅途难以忍受。我想自己再也到不了了。

一到站，我就驱车赶到了英格兰酒店。他们告诉我说，两天前厄斯金已经被埋葬在了英国人的墓地。整个悲剧有一种可怕而又怪诞的气氛。我说了各种各样的疯话，大厅里的人都好奇地看着我。

突然，厄斯金夫人满面哀伤，穿过前庭。看到我后，她向我走来，低声说了几句关于她可怜的儿子的话，就放声大哭。我把她领进起居室。一位上了年纪的先生在那里等着她。他是个英国医生。

我们谈了很多有关厄斯金的情况，但我对他自杀的动机只字未提。显而易见，他没有告诉他的母亲，是什么原因逼迫他做出如此致命、如此疯狂的行为。最后，厄斯金夫人起身说道：“乔治给你留下了一件东西作为纪念。这是他非常珍视的一件东西。我去给你拿来。”

她一离开房间，我就转身对医生说道：“这对厄斯金夫人一定是一个非常可怕的打击！我对她居然这么能忍受感到惊讶。”

“噢，她几个月前就知道会是这样。”他答道。

“几个月前就知道！”我嚷道，“可她为什么不阻止他呢？她为什么不让人看着他呢？他一定是疯了。”

医生盯着我。“我不明白你是什么意思。”他说。

“噢，”我喊道，“如果母亲知道她的儿子要自杀——”

“自杀！”他回答说，“可怜的厄斯金没有自杀。他死于肺病。他来这里就是等死的。看到他的那一刻，我就知道没有希望了。一只肺几乎没有了，另一只肺也受到了非常严重的感染。去世前三天，他问我还有没有什么希望。我对他坦言没有什么希望了，他只有几天活头了。他写了几封信，完全听天由命，直到最后都能保持清醒。”

正在此刻，厄斯金夫人手里拿着威利·休斯那幅致命的画像，走进了房间。“临终前，乔治求我把这个给你。”她说。当我从她的手里接过画像的时候，她的眼泪扑簌簌地落在了我的手上。

那幅画像目前挂在我的书房里，我那些从事艺术的朋友都赞不绝口。他们已经确定那不是克卢埃的手笔，而是乌德里的。我从来都不喜欢把它真正的来历告诉他们。但有时，我看着它的时候，觉得关于《莎士比亚十四行诗集》的威利·休斯理论真的有好多话可说。

THE SPHINX WITHOUT A SECRET

An Etching


One afternoon I was sitting outside the Cafe de la Paix, watching the splendour and shabbiness of Parisian life, and wondering over my vermouth at the strange panorama of pride and poverty that was passing before me, when I heard some one call my name. I turned round and saw Lord Murchison. We had not met since we had been at college together, nearly ten years before, so I was delighted to come across him again, and we shook hands warmly. At Oxford we had been great friends. I had liked him immensely, he was so handsome, so high-spirited, and so honourable. We used to say of him that he would be the best of fellows, if he did not always speak the truth, but I think we really admired him all the more for his frankness. I found him a good deal changed. He looked anxious and puzzled, and seemed to be in doubt about something. I felt it could not be modern scepticism, for Murchison was the stoutest of Tories, and believed in the Pentateuch as firmly as he believed in the House of Peers; so I concluded that it was a woman, and asked him if he was married yet.

“I don't understand women well enough,” he answered.

“My dear Gerald,” I said, “women are meant to be loved, not to be understood.”

“I cannot love where I cannot trust,” he replied.

“I believe you have a mystery in your life, Gerald,” I exclaimed; “tell me about it.”

“Let us go for a drive,” he answered, “it is too crowded here. No, not a yellow carriage, any other colour——there, that dark green one will do;” and in a few moments we were trotting down the boulevard in the direction of the Madeleine.

“Where shall we go to?” I said.

“Oh, anywhere you like!” he answered——“to the restaurant in the Bois; we will dine there, and you shall tell me all about yourself.”

“I want to hear about you first,” I said. “Tell me your mystery.”

He took from his pocket a little silver-clasped morocco case, and handed it to me. I opened it. Inside there was the photograph of a woman. She was tall and slight, and strangely picturesque with her large vague eyes and loosened hair. She looked like a clairvoyante, and was wrapped in rich furs.

“What do you think of that face?” he said; “is it truthful?”

I examined it carefully. It seemed to me the face of some one who had a secret, but whether that secret was good or evil I could not say. Its beauty was a beauty moulded out of many mysteries——the beauty, in fact, which is psychological, not plastic——and the faint smile that just played across the lips was far too subtle to be really sweet.

“Well,” he cried impatiently, “what do you say?”

“She is the Gioconda in sables,” I answered. “Let me know all about her.”

“Not now,” he said; “after dinner,” and began to talk of other things.

When the waiter brought us our coffee and cigarettes I reminded Gerald of his promise. He rose from his seat, walked two or three times up and down the room, and, sinking into an arm-chair, told me the following story:

“One evening,” he said, “I was walking down Bond Street about five o'clock. There was a terrific crush of carriages, and the traffic was almost stopped. Close to the pavement was standing a little yellow brougham, which, for some reason or other, attracted my attention. As I passed by there looked out from it the face I showed you this afternoon. It fascinated me immediately. All that night I kept thinking of it, and all the next day. I wandered up and down that wretched Row, peering into every carriage, and waiting for the yellow brougham; but I could not find ma belle inconnue[1], and at last I began to think she was merely a dream. About a week afterwards I was dining with Madame de Rastail. Dinner was for eight o'clock; but at half-past eight we were still waiting in the drawing-room. Finally the servant threw open the door, and announced Lady Alroy. It was the woman I had been looking for. She came in very slowly, looking like a moonbeam in grey lace, and, to my intense delight, I was asked to take her in to dinner. After we had sat down, I remarked quite innocently, ‘I think I caught sight of you in Bond Street some time ago, Lady Alroy.’ She grew very pale, and said to me in a low voice, ‘Pray do not talk so loud; you may be overheard.’ I felt miserable at having made such a bad beginning, and plunged recklessly into the subject of the French plays. She spoke very little, always in the same low musical voice, and seemed as if she was afraid of some one listening. I fell passionately, stupidly in love, and the indefinable atmosphere of mystery that surrounded her excited my most ardent curiosity. When she was going away, which she did very soon after dinner, I asked her if I might call and see her. She hesitated for a moment, glanced round to see if any one was near us, and then said, ‘Yes; to-morrow at a quarter to five.’ I begged Madame de Rastail to tell me about her; but all that I could learn was that she was a widow with a beautiful house in Park Lane, and as some scientific bore began a dissertation on widows, as exemplifying the survival of the matrimonially fittest, I left and went home.

“The next day I arrived at Park Lane punctual to the moment, but was told by the butler that Lady Alroy had just gone out. I went down to the club quite unhappy and very much puzzled, and after long consideration wrote her a letter, asking if I might be allowed to try my chance some other afternoon. I had no answer for several days, but at last I got a little note saying she would be at home on Sunday at four, and with this extraordinary postscript: ‘Please do not write to me here again; I will explain when I see you.’ On Sunday she received me, and was perfectly charming; but when I was going away she begged of me, if I ever had occasion to write to her again, to address my letter to ‘Mrs. Knox, care of Whittaker's Library, Green Street.’ ‘There are reasons,’ she said, ‘why I cannot receive letters in my own house.’

“All through the season I saw a great deal of her, and the atmosphere of mystery never left her. Sometimes I thought she was in the power of some man, but she looked so unapproachable that I could not believe it. It was really very difficult for me to come to any conclusion, for she was like one of those strange crystals that one sees in museums, which are at one moment clear, and at another clouded. At last I determined to ask her to be my wife: I was sick and tired of the incessant secrecy that she imposed on all my visits, and on the few letters I sent her. I wrote to her at the library to ask her if she could see me the following Monday at six. She answered yes, and I was in the seventh heaven of delight. I was infatuated with her: in spite of the mystery, I thought then——in consequence of it, I see now. No; it was the woman herself I loved. The mystery troubled me, maddened me. Why did chance put me in its track?”

“You discovered it, then?” I cried.

“I fear so,” he answered. “You can judge for yourself.”

“When Monday came round I went to lunch with my uncle, and about four o'clock found myself in the Marylebone Road. My uncle, you know, lives in Regent's Park. I wanted to get to Piccadilly, and took a short cut through a lot of shabby little streets. Suddenly I saw in front of me Lady Alroy, deeply veiled and walking very fast. On coming to the last house in the street, she went up the steps, took out a latch-key, and let herself in. ‘Here is the mystery,’ I said to myself; and I hurried on and examined the house. It seemed a sort of place for letting lodgings. On the doorstep lay her handkerchief, which she had dropped. I picked it up and put it in my pocket. Then I began to consider what I should do. I came to the conclusion that I had no right to spy on her, and I drove down to the club. At six I called to see her. She was lying on a sofa, in a tea-gown of silver tissue looped up by some strange moonstones that she always wore. She was looking quite lovely. ‘I am so glad to see you,’ she said; ‘I have not been out all day.’ I stared at her in amazement, and pulling the handkerchief out of my pocket, handed it to her. ‘You dropped this in Cumnor Street this afternoon, Lady Alroy,’ I said very calmly. She looked at me in terror, but made no attempt to take the handkerchief. ‘What were you doing there?’ I asked. ‘What right have you to question me?’ she answered. ‘The right of a man who loves you,’ I replied; ‘I came here to ask you to be my wife.’ She hid her face in her hands, and burst into floods of tears. ‘You must tell me,’ I continued. She stood up, and, looking me straight in the face, said, ‘Lord Murchison, there is nothing to tell you.’ —— ‘You went to meet some one,’ I cried; ‘this is your mystery.’ She grew dreadfully white, and said, ‘I went to meet no one.’ —— ‘Can't you tell the truth?’ I exclaimed. ‘I have told it,’ she replied. I was mad, frantic; I don't know what I said, but I said terrible things to her. Finally I rushed out of the house. She wrote me a letter the next day; I sent it back unopened, and started for Norway with Alan Colville. After a month I came back, and the first thing I saw in the Morning Post was the death of Lady Alroy. She had caught a chill at the Opera, and had died in five days of congestion of the lungs. I shut myself up and saw no one. I had loved her so much, I had loved her so madly. Good God! how I had loved that woman!”

“You went to the street, to the house in it?” I said.

“Yes,” he answered.

“One day I went to Cumnor Street. I could not help it; I was tortured with doubt. I knocked at the door, and a respectable-looking woman opened it to me. I asked her if she had any rooms to let. ‘Well, sir,’ she replied, ‘the drawing-rooms are supposed to be let; but I have not seen the lady for three months, and as rent is owing on them, you can have them.’ —— ‘Is this the lady?’ I said, showing the photograph. ‘That's her, sure enough,’ she exclaimed; ‘and when is she coming back, sir?’ —— ‘The lady is dead,’ I replied.‘Oh, sir, I hope not!’ said the woman; ‘she was my best lodger. She paid me three guineas a week merely to sit in my drawing-rooms now and then.’ —— ‘She met some one here?’ I said; but the woman assured me that it was not so, that she always came alone, and saw no one. ‘What on earth did she do here?’ I cried. ‘She simply sat in the drawing-room, sir, reading books, and sometimes had tea,’ the woman answered. I did not know what to say, so I gave her a sovereign and went away. Now, what do you think it all meant? You don't believe the woman was telling the truth?”

“I do.”

“Then why did Lady Alroy go there?”

“My dear Gerald,” I answered, “Lady Alroy was simply a woman with a mania for mystery. She took these rooms for the pleasure of going there with her veil down, and imagining she was a heroine. She had a passion for secrecy, but she herself was merely a Sphinx without a secret.”

“Do you really think so?”

“I am sure of it,” I replied.

He took out the morocco case, opened it, and looked at the photograph. “I wonder?” he said at last.

THE MODEL MILLIONAIRE

A Note of Admiration


Unless one is wealthy there is no use in being a charming fellow. Romance is the privilege of the rich, not the profession of the unemployed. The poor should be practical and prosaic. It is better to have a permanent income than to be fascinating. These are the great truths of modern life which Hughie Erskine never realised. Poor Hughie! Intellectually, we must admit, he was not of much importance. He never said a brilliant or even an ill-natured thing in his life. But then he was wonderfully good-looking, with his crisp brown hair, his clear-cut profile, and his grey eyes. He was as popular with men as he was with women, and he had every accomplishment except that of making money. His father had bequeathed him his cavalry sword, and a History of the Peninsular War in fifteen volumes. Hughie hung the first over his looking-glass, put the second on a shelf between Ruff's Guide and Bailey's Magazine, and lived on two hundred a year that an old aunt allowed him. He had tried everything. He had gone on the Stock Exchange for six months; but what was a butterfly to do among bulls and bears? He had been a tea-merchant for a little longer, but had soon tired of pekoe and souchong. Then he had tried selling dry sherry. That did not answer; the sherry was a little too dry. Ultimately he became nothing, a delightful, ineffectual young man with a perfect profile and no profession.

To make matters worse, he was in love. The girl he loved was Laura Merton, the daughter of a retired Colonel who had lost his temper and his digestion in India, and had never found either of them again. Laura adored him, and he was ready to kiss her shoe-strings. They were the handsomest couple in London, and had not a penny-piece between them. The Colonel was very fond of Hughie, but would not hear of any engagement.

“Come to me, my boy, when you have got ten thousand pounds of your own, and we will see about it,” he used to say; and Hughie looked very glum in those days, and had to go to Laura for consolation.

One morning, as he was on his way to Holland Park, where the Mertons lived, he dropped in to see a great friend of his, Alan Trevor. Trevor was a painter. Indeed, few people escape that nowadays. But he was also an artist, and artists are rather rare. Personally he was a strange rough fellow, with a freckled face and a red ragged beard. However, when he took up the brush he was a real master, and his pictures were eagerly sought after. He had been very much attracted by Hughie at first, it must be acknowledged, entirely on account of his personal charm. “The only people a painter should know,” he used to say, “are people who are bête[1] and beautiful, people who are an artistic pleasure to look at and an intellectual repose to talk to. Men who are dandies and women who are darlings rule the world, at least they should do so.” However, after he got to know Hughie better, he liked him quite as much for his bright, buoyant spirits and his generous reckless nature, and had given him the permanent entrée to his studio.

When Hughie came in he found Trevor putting the finishing touches to a wonderful life-size picture of a beggar-man. The beggar himself was standing on a raised platform in a corner of the studio. He was a wizened old man, with a face like wrinkled parchment, and a most piteous expression. Over his shoulder was flung a coarse brown cloak, all tears and tatters; his thick boots were patched and cobbled, and with one hand he leant on a rough stick, while with the other he held out his battered hat for alms.

“What an amazing model!” whispered Hughie, as he shook hands with his friend.

“An amazing model?” shouted Trevor at the top of his voice; “I should think so! Such beggars as he are not to be met with every day. A trouvaille, mon cher;[2] a living Velasquez! My stars! what an etching Rembrandt would have made of him!”

“Poor old chap!” said Hughie, “how miserable he looks! But I suppose, to you painters, his face is his fortune?”

“Certainly,” replied Trevor, “you don't want a beggar to look happy, do you?”

“How much does a model get for sitting?” asked Hughie, as he found himself a comfortable seat on a divan.

“A shilling an hour.”

“And how much do you get for your picture, Alan?”

“Oh, for this I get two thousand!”

“Pounds?”

“Guineas. Painters, poets, and physicians always get guineas.”

“Well, I think the model should have a percentage,” cried Hughie, laughing; “they work quite as hard as you do.”

“Nonsense, nonsense! Why, look at the trouble of laying on the paint alone, and standing all day long at one's easel! It's all very well, Hughie, for you to talk, but I assure you that there are moments when Art almost attains to the dignity of manual labour. But you mustn't chatter; I'm very busy. Smoke a cigarette, and keep quiet.”

After some time the servant came in, and told Trevor that the framemaker wanted to speak to him.

“Don't run away, Hughie,” he said, as he went out, “I will be back in a moment.”

The old beggar man took advantage of Trevor's absence to rest for a moment on a wooden bench that was behind him. He looked so forlorn and wretched that Hughie could not help pitying him, and felt in his pockets to see what money he had. All he could find was a sovereign and some coppers. “Poor old fellow,” he thought to himself, “he wants it more than I do, but it means no hansoms for a fortnight;” and he walked across the studio and slipped the sovereign into the beggar's hand.

The old man started, and a faint smile flitted across his withered lips. “Thank you, sir,” he said, “thank you.”

Then Trevor arrived, and Hughie took his leave, blushing a little at what he had done. He spent the day with Laura, got a charming scolding for his extravagance, and had to walk home.

That night he strolled into the Palette Club about eleven o'clock, and found Trevor sitting by himself in the smoking-room drinking hock and seltzer.

“Well, Alan, did you get the picture finished all right?” he said, as he lit his cigarette.

“Finished and framed, my boy!” answered Trevor; “and, by the bye, you have made a conquest. That old model you saw is quite devoted to you. I had to tell him all about you——who you are, where you live, what your income is, what prospects you have——”

“My dear Alan,” cried Hughie, “I shall probably find him waiting for me when I go home. But, of course, you are only joking. Poor old wretch! I wish I could do something for him. I think it is dreadful that any one should be so miserable. I have got heaps of old clothes at home——do you think he would care for any of them? Why, his rags were falling to bits.”

“But he looks splendid in them,” said Trevor. “I wouldn't paint him in a frock coat for anything. What you call rags I call romance. What seems poverty to you is picturesqueness to me. However, I'll tell him of your offer.”

“Alan,” said Hughie seriously, “you painters are a heartless lot.”

“An artist's heart is his head,” replied Trevor; “and besides, our business is to realise the world as we see it, not to reform it as we know it. A chacun son métier.[3] And now tell me how Laura is. The old model was quite interested in her.”

“You don't mean to say you talked to him about her?” said Hughie.

“Certainly I did. He knows all about the relentless Colonel, the lovely Laura, and the £10,000.”

“You told that old beggar all my private affairs?” cried Hughie, looking very red and angry.

“My dear boy,” said Trevor, smiling, “that old beggar, as you call him, is one of the richest men in Europe. He could buy all London to-morrow without overdrawing his account. He has a house in every capital, dines off gold plate, and can prevent Russia going to war when he chooses.”

“What on earth do you mean?” exclaimed Hughie.

“What I say,” said Trevor. “The old man you saw to-day in the studio was Baron Hausberg. He is a great friend of mine, buys all my pictures and that sort of thing, and gave me a commission a month ago to paint him as a beggar. Que voulez-vous? La fantaisie d'un millionnaire![4] And I must say he made a magnificent figure in his rags, or perhaps I should say in my rags; they are an old suit I got in Spain.”

“Baron Hausberg!” cried Hughie. “Good heavens! I gave him a sovereign!” and he sank into an arm-chair the picture of dismay.

“Gave him a sovereign!” shouted Trevor, and he burst into a roar of laughter. “My dear boy, you'll never see it again. Son affaire c'est l'argent des autres.[5]”

“I think you might have told me, Alan,” said Hughie sulkily, “and not have let me make such a fool of myself.”

“Well, to begin with, Hughie,” said Trevor, “it never entered my mind that you went about distributing alms in that reckless way. I can understand your kissing a pretty model, but your giving a sovereign to an ugly one——by Jove, no! Besides, the fact is that I really was not at home to-day to any one; and when you came in I didn't know whether Hausberg would like his name mentioned. You know he wasn't in full dress.”

“What a duffer he must think me!” said Hughie.

“Not at all. He was in the highest spirits after you left; kept chuckling to himself and rubbing his old wrinkled hands together. I couldn't make out why he was so interested to know all about you; but I see it all now. He'll invest your sovereign for you, Hughie, pay you the interest every six months, and have a capital story to tell after dinner.”

“I am an unlucky devil,” growled Hughie. “The best thing I can do is to go to bed; and, my dear Alan, you mustn't tell any one. I shouldn't dare show my face in the Row.”

“Nonsense! It reflects the highest credit on your philanthropic spirit, Hughie. And don't run away. Have another cigarette, and you can talk about Laura as much as you like.”

However, Hughie wouldn't stop, but walked home, feeling very unhappy, and leaving Alan Trevor in fits of laughter.

The next morning, as he was at breakfast, the servant brought him up a card on which was written, “Monsieur Gustave Naudin, de la part de[6] M. le Baron Hausberg.”“I suppose he has come for an apology,” said Hughie to himself; and he told the servant to show the visitor up.

An old gentleman with gold spectacles and grey hair came into the room, and said, in a slight French accent, “Have I the honour of addressing Monsieur Erskine?”

Hughie bowed.

“I have come from Baron Hausberg,” he continued. “The Baron——”

“I beg, sir, that you will offer him my sincerest apologies,” stammered Hughie.

“The Baron,” said the old gentleman, with a smile, “has commissioned me to bring you this letter;” and he extended a sealed envelope.

On the outside was written, “A wedding present to Hugh Erskine and Laura Merton, from an old beggar,” and inside was a cheque for £10,000.

When they were married Alan Trevor was the best man, and the Baron made a speech at the wedding breakfast.

“Millionaire models,” remarked Alan, “are rare enough; but, by Jove, model millionaires are rarer still!”

LORD ARTHUR SAVILE'S CRIME

A Study of Duty


Chapter 1


It was Lady Windermere's last reception before Easter, and Bentinck House was even more crowded than usual. Six Cabinet Ministers had come on from the Speaker's Levée in their stars and ribands, all the pretty women wore their smartest dresses, and at the end of the picture-gallery stood the Princess Sophia of Carlsrühe, a heavy Tartar-looking lady, with tiny black eyes and wonderful emeralds, talking bad French at the top of her voice, and laughing immoderately at everything that was said to her. It was certainly a wonderful medley of people. Gorgeous peeresses chatted affably to violent Radicals, popular preachers brushed coat-tails with eminent sceptics, a perfect bevy of bishops kept following a stout prima-donna from room to room, on the staircase stood several Royal Academicians, disguised as artists, and it was said that at one time the supper-room was absolutely crammed with geniuses. In fact, it was one of Lady Windermere's best nights, and the Princess stayed till nearly half-past eleven.

As soon as she had gone, Lady Windermere returned to the picture-gallery, where a celebrated political economist was solemnly explaining the scientific theory of music to an indignant virtuoso from Hungary, and began to talk to the Duchess of Paisley. She looked wonderfully beautiful with her grand ivory throat, her large blue forget-me-not eyes, and her heavy coils of golden hair. Or pur[1] they were——not that pale straw colour that nowadays usurps the gracious name of gold, but such gold as is woven into sunbeams or hidden in strange amber; and they gave to her face something of the frame of a saint, with not a little of the fascination of a sinner. She was a curious psychological study. Early in life she had discovered the important truth that nothing looks so like innocence as an indiscretion; and by a series of reckless escapades, half of them quite harmless, she had acquired all the privileges of a personality. She had more than once changed her husband; indeed, Debrett credits her with three marriages; but as she had never changed her lover, the world had long ago ceased to talk scandal about her. She was now forty years of age, childless, and with that inordinate passion for pleasure which is the secret of remaining young.

Suddenly she looked eagerly round the room, and said, in her clear contralto voice, “Where is my chiromantist?”

“Your what, Gladys?” exclaimed the Duchess, giving an involuntary start.

“My chiromantist, Duchess; I can't live without him at present.”

“Dear Gladys! you are always so original,” murmured the Duchess, trying to remember what a chiromantist really was, and hoping it was not the same as a chiropodist.

“He comes to see my hand twice a week regularly,” continued Lady Windermere, “and is most interesting about it.”

“Good heavens!” said the Duchess to herself, “he is a sort of chiropodist after all. How very dreadful. I hope he is a foreigner at any rate. It wouldn't be quite so bad then.”

“I must certainly introduce him to you.”

“Introduce him!” cried the Duchess; “you don't mean to say he is here?” and she began looking about for a small tortoise-shell fan and a very tattered lace shawl, so as to be ready to go at a moment's notice.

“Of course he is here; I would not dream of giving a party without him. He tells me I have a pure psychic hand, and that if my thumb had been the least little bit shorter, I should have been a confirmed pessimist, and gone into a convent.”

“Oh, I see!” said the Duchess, feeling very much relieved; “he tells fortunes, I suppose?”

“And misfortunes, too,” answered Lady Windermere, “any amount of them. Next year, for instance, I am in great danger, both by land and sea, so I am going to live in a balloon, and draw up my dinner in a basket every evening. It is all written down on my little finger, or on the palm of my hand, I forget which.”

“But surely that is tempting Providence, Gladys.”

“My dear Duchess, surely Providence can resist temptation by this time. I think every one should have their hands told once a month, so as to know what not to do. Of course, one does it all the same, but it is so pleasant to be warned. Now if some one doesn't go and fetch Mr. Podgers at once, I shall have to go myself.”

“Let me go, Lady Windermere,” said a tall handsome young man, who was standing by, listening to the conversation with an amused smile.

“Thanks so much, Lord Arthur; but I am afraid you wouldn't recognise him.”

“If he is as wonderful as you say, Lady Windermere, I couldn't well miss him. Tell me what he is like, and I'll bring him to you at once.”

“Well, he is not a bit like a chiromantist. I mean he is not mysterious, or esoteric, or romantic-looking. He is a little, stout man, with a funny, bald head, and great gold-rimmed spectacles; something between a family doctor and a country attorney. I'm really very sorry, but it is not my fault. People are so annoying. All my pianists look exactly like poets; and all my poets look exactly like pianists; and I remember last season asking a most dreadful conspirator to dinner, a man who had blown up ever so many people, and always wore a coat of mail, and carried a dagger up his shirt-sleeve; and do you know that when he came he looked just like a nice old clergyman, and cracked jokes all the evening? Of course, he was very amusing, and all that, but I was awfully disappointed; and when I asked him about the coat of mail, he only laughed, and said it was far too cold to wear in England. Ah, here is Mr. Podgers! Now, Mr. Podgers, I want you to tell the Duchess of Paisley's hand. Duchess, you must take your glove off. No, not the left hand, the other.”

“Dear Gladys, I really don't think it is quite right,” said the Duchess, feebly unbuttoning a rather soiled kid glove.

“Nothing interesting ever is,” said Lady Windermere: “on a fait le monde ainsi.[2] But I must introduce you. Duchess, this is Mr. Podgers, my pet chiromantist. Mr. Podgers, this is the Duchess of Paisley, and if you say that she has a larger mountain of the moon than I have, I will never believe in you again.”

“I am sure, Gladys, there is nothing of the kind in my hand,” said the Duchess gravely.

“Your Grace is quite right,” said Mr. Podgers, glancing at the little fat hand with its short square fingers, “the mountain of the moon is not developed. The line of life, however, is excellent. Kindly bend the wrist. Thank you. Three distinct lines on the rascette[3]! You will live to a great age, Duchess, and be extremely happy. Ambition——very moderate, line of intellect not exaggerated, line of heart——”

“Now, do be indiscreet, Mr. Podgers,” cried Lady Windermere.

“Nothing would give me greater pleasure,” said Mr. Podgers, bowing, “if the Duchess ever had been, but I am sorry to say that I see great permanence of affection, combined with a strong sense of duty.”

“Pray go on, Mr. Podgers,” said the Duchess, looking quite pleased.

“Economy is not the least of your Grace's virtues,” continued Mr. Podgers, and Lady Windermere went off into fits of laughter.

“Economy is a very good thing,” remarked the Duchess complacently; “when I married Paisley he had eleven castles, and not a single house fit to live in.”

“And now he has twelve houses, and not a single castle,” cried Lady Windermere.

“Well, my dear,” said the Duchess, “I like——”

“Comfort,” said Mr. Podgers, “and modern improvements, and hot water laid on in every bedroom. Your Grace is quite right. Comfort is the only thing our civilisation can give us.”

“You have told the Duchess's character admirably, Mr. Podgers, and now you must tell Lady Flora's;” and in answer to a nod from the smiling hostess, a tall girl, with sandy Scotch hair, and high shoulder-blades, stepped awkwardly from behind the sofa, and held out a long, bony hand with spatulate fingers.

“Ah, a pianist! I see,” said Mr. Podgers, “an excellent pianist, but perhaps hardly a musician. Very reserved, very honest, and with a great love of animals.”

“Quite true!” exclaimed the Duchess, turning to Lady Windermere, “absolutely true! Flora keeps two dozen collie dogs at Macloskie, and would turn our town house into a menagerie if her father would let her.”

“Well, that is just what I do with my house every Thursday evening,” cried Lady Windermere, laughing, “only I like lions better than collie dogs.”

“Your one mistake, Lady Windermere,” said Mr. Podgers, with a pompous bow.

“If a woman can't make her mistakes charming, she is only a female,” was the answer. “But you must read some more hands for us. Come, Sir Thomas, show Mr. Podgers yours;” and a genial-looking old gentleman, in a white waistcoat, came forward, and held out a thick rugged hand, with a very long third finger.

“An adventurous nature; four long voyages in the past, and one to come. Been shipwrecked three times. No, only twice, but in danger of a shipwreck your next journey. A strong Conservative, very punctual, and with a passion for collecting curiosities. Had a severe illness between the ages of sixteen and eighteen. Was left a fortune when about thirty. Great aversion to cats and Radicals.”

“Extraordinary!” exclaimed Sir Thomas; “you must really tell my wife's hand, too.”

“Your second wife's,” said Mr. Podgers quietly, still keeping Sir Thomas's hand in his. “Your second wife's. I shall be charmed;” but Lady Marvel, a melancholy-looking woman, with brown hair and sentimental eyelashes, entirely declined to have her past or her future exposed; and nothing that Lady Windermere could do would induce Monsieur de Koloff the Russian Ambassador, even to take his gloves off. In fact, many people seemed afraid to face the odd little man with his stereotyped smile, his gold spectacles, and his bright, beady eyes; and when he told poor Lady Fermor, right out before every one, that she did not care a bit for music, but was extremely fond of musicians, it was generally felt that cheiromancy was a most dangerous science, and one that ought not to be encouraged, except in a tête-à-tête.

Lord Arthur Savile, however, who did not know anything about Lady Fermor's unfortunate story, and who had been watching Mr. Podgers with a great deal of interest, was filled with an immense curiosity to have his own hand read, and feeling somewhat shy about putting himself forward, crossed over the room to where Lady Windermere was sitting, and, with a charming blush, asked her if she thought Mr. Podgers would mind.

“Of course, he won't mind,” said Lady Windermere, “that is what he is here for. All my lions, Lord Arthur, are performing lions, and jump through hoops whenever I ask them. But I must warn you beforehand that I shall tell Sybil everything. She is coming to lunch with me to-morrow, to talk about bonnets, and if Mr. Podgers finds out that you have a bad temper, or a tendency to gout, or a wife living in Bayswater, I shall certainly let her know all about it.”

Lord Arthur smiled, and shook his head. “I am not afraid,” he answered. “Sybil knows me as well as I know her.”

“Ah! I am a little sorry to hear you say that. The proper basis for marriage is a mutual misunderstanding. No, I am not at all cynical, I have merely got experience, which, however, is very much the same thing. Mr. Podgers, Lord Arthur Savile is dying to have his hand read. Don't tell him that he is engaged to one of the most beautiful girls in London, because that appeared in the Morning Post a month ago.”

“Dear Lady Windermere,” cried the Marchioness of Jedburgh, “do let Mr. Podgers stay here a little longer. He has just told me I should go on the stage, and I am so interested.”

“If he has told you that, Lady Jedburgh, I shall certainly take him away. Come over at once, Mr. Podgers, and read Lord Arthur's hand.”

“Well,” said Lady Jedburgh, making a little moue as she rose from the sofa, “if I am not to be allowed to go on the stage, I must be allowed to be part of the audience at any rate.”

“Of course; we are all going to be part of the audience,” said Lady Windermere; “and now, Mr. Podgers, be sure and tell us something nice. Lord Arthur is one of my special favourites.”

But when Mr. Podgers saw Lord Arthur's hand he grew curiously pale, and said nothing. A shudder seemed to pass through him, and his great bushy eyebrows twitched convulsively, in an odd, irritating way they had when he was puzzled. Then some huge beads of perspiration broke out on his yellow forehead, like a poisonous dew, and his fat fingers grew cold and clammy.

Lord Arthur did not fail to notice these strange signs of agitation, and, for the first time in his life, he himself felt fear. His impulse was to rush from the room, but he restrained himself. It was better to know the worst, whatever it was, than to be left in this hideous uncertainty.

“I am waiting, Mr. Podgers,” he said.

“We are all waiting,” cried Lady Windermere, in her quick, impatient manner, but the chiromantist made no reply.

“I believe Arthur is going on the stage,” said Lady Jedburgh, “and that, after your scolding, Mr. Podgers is afraid to tell him so.”

Suddenly Mr. Podgers dropped Lord Arthur's right hand, and seized hold of his left, bending down so low to examine it that the gold rims of his spectacles seemed almost to touch the palm. For a moment his face became a white mask of horror, but he soon recovered his sang-froid, and looking up at Lady Windermere, said with a forced smile, “It is the hand of a charming young man.”

“Of course it is!” answered Lady Windermere, “but will he be a charming husband? That is what I want to know.”

“All charming young men are,” said Mr. Podgers.

“I don't think a husband should be too fascinating,” murmured Lady Jedburgh pensively, “it is so dangerous.”

“My dear child, they never are too fascinating,” cried Lady Windermere. “But what I want are details. Details are the only things that interest. What is going to happen to Lord Arthur?”

“Well, within the next few months Lord Arthur will go a voyage——”

“Oh yes, his honeymoon, of course!”

“And lose a relative.”

“Not his sister, I hope?” said Lady Jedburgh, in a piteous tone of voice.

“Certainly not his sister,” answered Mr. Podgers, with a deprecating wave of the hand, “a distant relative merely.”

“Well, I am dreadfully disappointed,” said Lady Windermere. “I have absolutely nothing to tell Sybil to-morrow. No one cares about distant relatives nowadays. They went out of fashion years ago. However, I suppose she had better have a black silk by her; it always does for church, you know. And now let us go to supper. They are sure to have eaten everything up, but we may find some hot soup. Francois used to make excellent soup once, but he is so agitated about politics at present, that I never feel quite certain about him. I do wish General Boulanger would keep quiet. Duchess, I am sure you are tired?”

“Not at all, dear Gladys,” answered the Duchess, waddling towards the door. “I have enjoyed myself immensely, and the chiropodist, I mean the chiromantist, is most interesting. Flora, where can my tortoise-shell fan be? Oh, thank you, Sir Thomas, so much. And my lace shawl, Flora? Oh, thank you, Sir Thomas, very kind, I'm sure;” and the worthy creature finally managed to get downstairs without dropping her scent-bottle more than twice.

All this time Lord Arthur Savile had remained standing by the fireplace, with the same feeling of dread over him, the same sickening sense of coming evil. He smiled sadly at his sister, as she swept past him on Lord Plymdale's arm, looking lovely in her pink brocade and pearls, and he hardly heard Lady Windermere when she called to him to follow her. He thought of Sybil Merton, and the idea that anything could come between them made his eyes dim with tears.

Looking at him, one would have said that Nemesis had stolen the shield of Pallas, and shown him the Gorgon's head. He seemed turned to stone, and his face was like marble in its melancholy. He had lived the delicate and luxurious life of a young man of birth and fortune, a life exquisite in its freedom from sordid care, its beautiful boyish insouciance; and now for the first time he became conscious of the terrible mystery of Destiny, of the awful meaning of Doom.

How mad and monstrous it all seemed! Could it be that written on his hand, in characters that he could not read himself, but that another could decipher, was some fearful secret of sin, some blood-red sign of crime? Was there no escape possible? Were we no better than chessmen, moved by an unseen power, vessels the potter fashions at his fancy, for honour or for shame? His reason revolted against it, and yet he felt that some tragedy was hanging over him, and that he had been suddenly called upon to bear an intolerable burden. Actors are so fortunate. They can choose whether they will appear in tragedy or in comedy, whether they will suffer or make merry, laugh or shed tears. But in real life it is different. Most men and women are forced to perform parts for which they have no qualifications. Our Guildensterns play Hamlet for us, and our Hamlets have to jest like Prince Hal. The world is a stage, but the play is badly cast.

Suddenly Mr. Podgers entered the room. When he saw Lord Arthur he started, and his coarse, fat face became a sort of greenish-yellow colour. The two men's eyes met, and for a moment there was silence.

“The Duchess has left one of her gloves here, Lord Arthur, and has asked me to bring it to her,” said Mr. Podgers finally. “Ah, I see it on the sofa! Good evening.”

“Mr. Podgers, I must insist on your giving me a straightforward answer to a question I am going to put to you.”

“Another time, Lord Arthur, but the Duchess is anxious. I am afraid I must go.”

“You shall not go. The Duchess is in no hurry.”

“Ladies should not be kept waiting, Lord Arthur,” said Mr. Podgers, with his sickly smile. “The fair sex is apt to be impatient.”

Lord Arthur's finely-chiselled lips curled in petulant disdain. The poor Duchess seemed to him of very little importance at that moment. He walked across the room to where Mr. Podgers was standing, and held his hand out.

“Tell me what you saw there,” he said. “Tell me the truth. I must know it. I am not a child.”

Mr Podgers's eyes blinked behind his gold-rimmed spectacles, and he moved uneasily from one foot to the other, while his fingers played nervously with a flash watch-chain.

“What makes you think that I saw anything in your hand, Lord Arthur, more than I told you?”

“I know you did, and I insist on your telling me what it was. I will pay you. I will give you a cheque for a hundred pounds.”

The green eyes flashed for a moment, and then became dull again.

“Guineas?” said Mr. Podgers at last, in a low voice.

“Certainly. I will send you a cheque to-morrow. What is your club?”

“I have no club. That is to say, not just at present. My address is——but allow me to give you my card;” and producing a bit of gilt-edged pasteboard from his waistcoat pocket, Mr. Podgers handed it, with a low bow, to Lord Arthur, who read on it,





MR. SEPTIMUS R. PODGERS

Professional Chiromantist

1030 West Moon Street





“My hours are from ten to four,” murmured Mr. Podgers mechanically, “and I make a reduction for families.”

“Be quick,” cried Lord Arthur, looking very pale, and holding his hand out.

Mr. Podgers glanced nervously round, and drew the heavy portière[4] across the door.

“It will take a little time, Lord Arthur, you had better sit down.”

“Be quick, sir,” cried Lord Arthur again, stamping his foot angrily on the polished floor.

Mr. Podgers smiled, drew from his breast-pocket a small magnifying glass, and wiped it carefully with his handkerchief.

“I am quite ready,” he said.





Chapter 2


Ten minutes later, with face blanched by terror, and eyes wild with grief Lord Arthur Savile rushed from Bentinck House, crushing his way through the crowd of fur-coated footmen that stood round the large striped awning, and seeming not to see or hear anything. The night was bitter cold, and the gas-lamps round the square flared and flickered in the keen wind; but his hands were hot with fever, and his forehead burned like fire. On and on he went, almost with the gait of a drunken man. A policeman looked curiously at him as he passed, and a beggar, who slouched from an archway to ask for alms, grew frightened, seeing misery greater than his own. Once he stopped under a lamp, and looked at his hands. He thought he could detect the stain of blood already upon them, and a faint cry broke from his trembling lips.

Murder! that is what the chiromantist had seen there. Murder! The very night seemed to know it, and the desolate wind to howl it in his ear. The dark corners of the streets were full of it. It grinned at him from the roofs of the houses.

First he came to the Park, whose sombre woodland seemed to fascinate him. He leaned wearily up against the railings, cooling his brow against the wet metal, and listening to the tremulous silence of the trees. “Murder! murder!” he kept repeating, as though iteration could dim the horror of the word. The sound of his own voice made him shudder, yet he almost hoped that Echo might hear him, and wake the slumbering city from its dreams. He felt a mad desire to stop the casual passer-by, and tell him everything.

Then he wandered across Oxford Street into narrow, shameful alleys. Two women with painted faces mocked at him as he went by. From a dark courtyard came a sound of oaths and blows, followed by shrill screams, and, huddled upon a damp door-step, he saw the crooked-back forms of poverty and eld. A strange pity came over him. Were these children of sin and misery predestined to their end, as he to his? Were they, like him, merely the puppets of a monstrous show?

And yet it was not the mystery, but the comedy of suffering that struck him; its absolute uselessness, its grotesque want of meaning. How incoherent everything seemed! How lacking in all harmony! He was amazed at the discord between the shallow optimism of the day, and the real facts of existence. He was still very young.

After a time he found himself in front of Marylebone Church. The silent roadway looked like a long riband of polished silver, flecked here and there by the dark arabesques of waving shadows. Far into the distance curved the line of flickering gas-lamps, and outside a little walled-in house stood a solitary hansom, the driver asleep inside. He walked hastily in the direction of Portland Place, now and then looking round, as though he feared that he was being followed. At the corner of Rich Street stood two men, reading a small bill upon a hoarding. An odd feeling of curiosity stirred him, and he crossed over. As he came near, the word “Murder,” printed in black letters, met his eye. He started, and a deep flush came into his cheek. It was an advertisement offering a reward for any information leading to the arrest of a man of medium height, between thirty and forty years of age, wearing a billy-cock hat, a black coat, and check trousers, and with a scar upon his right cheek. He read it over and over again, and wondered if the wretched man would be caught, and how he had been scarred. Perhaps, some day, his own name might be placarded on the walls of London. Some day, perhaps, a price would be set on his head also.

The thought made him sick with horror. He turned on his heel, and hurried on into the night.

Where he went he hardly knew. He had a dim memory of wandering through a labyrinth of sordid houses, and it was bright dawn when he found himself at last in Piccadilly Circus. As he strolled home towards Belgrave Square, he met the great waggons on their way to Covent Garden. The white-smocked carters, with their pleasant sunburnt faces and coarse curly hair, strode sturdily on, cracking their whips, and calling out now and then to each other; on the back of a huge grey horse, the leader of a jangling team, sat a chubby boy, with a bunch of primroses in his battered hat, keeping tight hold of the mane with his little hands, and laughing; and the great piles of vegetables looked like masses of jade against the morning sky, like masses of green jade against the pink petals of some marvellous rose. Lord Arthur felt curiously affected, he could not tell why. There was something in the dawn's delicate loveliness that seemed to him inexpressibly pathetic, and he thought of all the days that break in beauty, and that set in storm. These rustics, too, with their rough, good-humoured voices, and their nonchalant ways, what a strange London they saw! A London free from the sin of night and the smoke of day, a pallid, ghost-like city, a desolate town of tombs! He wondered what they thought of it, and whether they knew anything of its splendour and its shame, of its fierce, fiery-coloured joys, and its horrible hunger, of all it makes and mars from morn to eve. Probably it was to them merely a mart where they brought their fruits to sell, and where they tarried for a few hours at most, leaving the streets still silent, the houses still asleep. It gave him pleasure to watch them as they went by. Rude as they were, with their heavy, hob-nailed shoes, and their awkward gait, they brought a little of Arcady with them. He felt that they had lived with Nature, and that she had taught them peace. He envied them all that they did not know.

By the time he had reached Belgrave Square the sky was a faint blue, and the birds were beginning to twitter in the gardens.





Chapter 3


When Lord Arthur woke it was twelve o'clock, and the mid-day sun was streaming through the ivory-silk curtains of his room. He got up and looked out of the window. A dim haze of heat was hanging over the great city, and the roofs of the houses were like dull silver. In the flickering green of the square below some children were flitting about like white butterflies, and the pavement was crowded with people on their way to the Park. Never had life seemed lovelier to him, never had the things of evil seemed more remote.

Then his valet brought him a cup of chocolate on a tray. After he had drunk it, he drew aside a heavy portière of peach-coloured plush, and passed into the bathroom. The light stole softly from above, through thin slabs of transparent onyx, and the water in the marble tank glimmered like a moonstone. He plunged hastily in, till the cool ripples touched throat and hair, and then dipped his head right under, as though he would have wiped away the stain of some shameful memory. When he stepped out he felt almost at peace. The exquisite physical conditions of the moment had dominated him, as indeed often happens in the case of very finely-wrought natures, for the senses, like fire, can purify as well as destroy.

After breakfast, he flung himself down on a divan, and lit a cigarette. On the mantel-shelf, framed in dainty old brocade, stood a large photograph of Sybil Merton, as he had seen her first at Lady Noel's ball. The small, exquisitely-shaped head drooped slightly to one side, as though the thin, reed-like throat could hardly bear the burden of so much beauty; the lips were slightly parted, and seemed made for sweet music; and all the tender purity of girlhood looked out in wonder from the dreaming eyes. With her soft, clinging dress of crêpe de chine, and her large leaf-shaped fan, she looked like one of those delicate little figures men find in the olive-woods near Tanagra; and there was a touch of Greek grace in her pose and attitude. Yet she was not petite. She was simply perfectly proportioned——a rare thing in an age when so many women are either over life-size or insignificant.

Now as Lord Arthur looked at her, he was filled with the terrible pity that is born of love. He felt that to marry her, with the doom of murder hanging over his head, would be a betrayal like that of Judas, a sin worse than any the Borgia had ever dreamed of. What happiness could there be for them, when at any moment he might be called upon to carry out the awful prophecy written in his hand? What manner of life would be theirs while Fate still held this fearful fortune in the scales? The marriage must be postponed, at all costs. Of this he was quite resolved. Ardently though he loved the girl, and the mere touch of her fingers, when they sat together, made each nerve of his body thrill with exquisite joy, he recognised none the less clearly where his duty lay, and was fully conscious of the fact that he had no right to marry until he had committed the murder. This done, he could stand before the altar with Sybil Merton, and give his life into her hands without terror of wrongdoing. This done, he could take her to his arms, knowing that she would never have to blush for him, never have to hang her head in shame. But done it must be first; and the sooner the better for both.

Many men in his position would have preferred the primrose path of dalliance to the steep heights of duty; but Lord Arthur was too conscientious to set pleasure above principle. There was more than mere passion in his love; and Sybil was to him a symbol of all that is good and noble. For a moment he had a natural repugnance against what he was asked to do, but it soon passed away. His heart told him that it was not a sin, but a sacrifice; his reason reminded him that there was no other course open. He had to choose between living for himself and living for others, and terrible though the task laid upon him undoubtedly was, yet he knew that he must not suffer selfishness to triumph over love. Sooner or later we are all called upon to decide on the same issue——of us all, the same question is asked. To Lord Arthur it came early in life——before his nature had been spoiled by the calculating cynicism of middle-age, or his heart corroded by the shallow, fashionable egotism of our day, and he felt no hesitation about doing his duty. Fortunately also, for him, he was no mere dreamer, or idle dilettante. Had he been so, he would have hesitated, like Hamlet, and let irresolution mar his purpose. But he was essentially practical. Life to him meant action, rather than thought. He had that rarest of all things, common sense.

The wild, turbid feelings of the previous night had by this time completely passed away, and it was almost with a sense of shame that he looked back upon his mad wanderings from street to street, his fierce emotional agony. The very sincerity of his sufferings made them seem unreal to him now. He wondered how he could have been so foolish as to rant and rave about the inevitable. The only question that seemed to trouble him was, whom to make away with; for he was not blind to the fact that murder, like the religions of the Pagan world, requires a victim as well as a priest. Not being a genius, he had no enemies, and indeed he felt that this was not the time for the gratification of any personal pique or dislike, the mission in which he was engaged being one of great and grave solemnity. He accordingly made out a list of his friends and relatives on a sheet of notepaper, and after careful consideration, decided in favour of Lady Clementina Beauchamp, a dear old lady who lived in Curzon Street, and was his own second cousin by his mother's side. He had always been very fond of Lady Clem, as every one called her, and as he was very wealthy himself, having come into all Lord Rugby's property when he came of age, there was no possibility of his deriving any vulgar monetary advantage by her death. In fact, the more he thought over the matter, the more she seemed to him to be just the right person, and, feeling that any delay would be unfair to Sybil, he determined to make his arrangements at once.

The first thing to be done was, of course, to settle with the chiromantist; so he sat down at a small Sheraton writing-table that stood near the window, drew a cheque for £105, payable to the order of Mr. Septimus Podgers, and, enclosing it in an envelope, told his valet to take it to West Moon Street. He then telephoned to the stables for his hansom, and dressed to go out. As he was leaving the room, he looked back at Sybil Merton's photograph, and swore that, come what may, he would never let her know what he was doing for her sake, but would keep the secret of his self-sacrifice hidden always in his heart.

On his way to the Buckingham, he stopped at a florist's, and sent Sybil a beautiful basket of narcissi, with lovely white petals and staring pheasants' eyes, and on arriving at the club, went straight to the library, rang the bell, and ordered the waiter to bring him a lemon-and-soda, and a book on Toxicology. He had fully decided that poison was the best means to adopt in this troublesome business. Anything like personal violence was extremely distasteful to him, and besides, he was very anxious not to murder Lady Clementina in any way that might attract public attention, as he hated the idea of being lionised at Lady Windermere's, or seeing his name figuring in the paragraphs of vulgar society-newspapers. He had also to think of Sybil's father and mother, who were rather old-fashioned people, and might possibly object to the marriage if there was anything like a scandal, though he felt certain that if he told them the whole facts of the case they would be the very first to appreciate the motives that had actuated him. He had every reason, then, to decide in favour of poison. It was safe, sure, and quiet, and did away with any necessity for painful scenes, to which, like most Englishmen, he had a rooted objection.

Of the science of poisons, however, he knew absolutely nothing, and as the waiter seemed quite unable to find anything in the library but Ruff's Guide and Bailey's Magazine, he examined the book-shelves himself, and finally came across a handsomely-bound edition of the Pharmacopceia, and a copy of Erskine's Toxicology, edited by Sir Mathew Reid, the President of the Royal College of Physicians, and one of the oldest members of the Buckingham, having been elected in mistake for somebody else; a contretemps that so enraged the Committee, that when the real man came up they black-balled him unanimously. Lord Arthur was a good deal puzzled at the technical terms used in both books, and had begun to regret that he had not paid more attention to his classics at Oxford, when in the second volume of Erskine, he found a very complete account of the properties of aconitine, written in fairly clear English. It seemed to him to be exactly the poison he wanted. It was swift——indeed, almost immediate, in its effect——perfectly painless, and when taken in the form of a gelatine capsule, the mode recommended by Sir Mathew, not by any means unpalatable. He accordingly made a note, upon his shirt-cuff of the amount necessary for a fatal dose, put the books back in their places, and strolled up St. James's Street, to Pestle and Humbey's, the great chemists. Mr. Pestle, who always attended personally on the aristocracy, was a good deal surprised at the order, and in a very deferential manner murmured something about a medical certificate being necessary. However, as soon as Lord Arthur explained to him that it was for a large Norwegian mastiff that he was obliged to get rid of, as it showed signs of incipient rabies, and had already bitten the coachman twice in the calf of the leg, he expressed himself as being perfectly satisfied, complimented Lord Arthur on his wonderful knowledge of Toxicology, and had the prescription made up immediately.

Lord Arthur put the capsule into a pretty little silver bonbonnière that he saw in a shop window in Bond Street, threw away Pestle and Humbey's ugly pill-box, and drove off at once to Lady Clementina's.

“Well, monsieur le mauvais sujet,” cried the old lady, as he entered the room, “why haven't you been to see me all this time?”

“My dear Lady Clem, I never have a moment to myself,” said Lord Arthur, smiling.

“I suppose you mean that you go about all day long with Miss Sybil Merton, buying chiffons and talking nonsense? I cannot understand why people make such a fuss about being married. In my day we never dreamed of billing and cooing in public, or in private for that matter.”

“I assure you I have not seen Sybil for twenty-four hours, Lady Clem. As far as I can make out, she belongs entirely to her milliners.”

“Of course; that is the only reason you come to see an ugly old woman like myself. I wonder you men don't take warning. On a fait des folies pour moi, and here I am, a poor, rheumatic creature, with a false front and a bad temper. Why, if it were not for dear Lady Jansen, who sends me all the worst French novels she can find, I don't think I could get through the day. Doctors are no use at all, except to get fees out of one. They can't even cure my heartburn.”

“I have brought you a cure for that, Lady Clem,” said Lord Arthur gravely. “It is a wonderful thing, invented by an American.”

“I don't think I like American inventions, Arthur. I am quite sure I don't. I read some American novels lately, and they were quite nonsensical.”

“Oh, but there is no nonsense at all about this, Lady Clem! I assure you it is a perfect cure. You must promise to try it;” and Lord Arthur brought the little box out of his pocket, and handed it to her.

“Well, the box is charming, Arthur. Is it really a present? That is very sweet of you. And is this the wonderful medicine? It looks like a bonbon. I'll take it at once.”

“Good heavens! Lady Clem,” cried Lord Arthur, catching hold of her hand, “you mustn't do anything of the kind. It is a homoeopathic medicine, and if you take it without having heartburn, it might do you no end of harm. Wait till you have an attack, and take it then. You will be astonished at the result.”

“I should like to take it now,” said Lady Clementina, holding up to the light the little transparent capsule, with its floating bubble of liquid aconitine. “I am sure it is delicious. The fact is that, though I hate doctors, I love medicines. However, I'll keep it till my next attack.”

“And when will that be?” asked Lord Arthur eagerly. “Will it be soon?”

“I hope not for a week. I had a very bad time yesterday morning with it. But one never knows.”

“You are sure to have one before the end of the month then, Lady Clem?”

“I am afraid so. But how sympathetic you are to-day, Arthur! Really, Sybil has done you a great deal of good. And now you must run away, for I am dining with some very dull people, who won't talk scandal, and I know that if I don't get my sleep now I shall never be able to keep awake during dinner. Good-bye, Arthur, give my love to Sybil, and thank you so much for the American medicine.”

“You won't forget to take it, Lady Clem, will you?” said Lord Arthur, rising from his seat.

“Of course I won't, you silly boy. I think it is most kind of you to think of me, and I shall write and tell you if I want any more.”

Lord Arthur left the house in high spirits, and with a feeling of immense relief.

That night he had an interview with Sybil Merton. He told her how he had been suddenly placed in a position of terrible difficulty, from which neither honour nor duty would allow him to recede. He told her that the marriage must be put off for the present, as until he had got rid of his fearful entanglements, he was not a free man. He implored her to trust him, and not to have any doubts about the future. Everything would come right, but patience was necessary.

The scene took place in the conservatory of Mr. Merton's house, in Park Lane, where Lord Arthur had dined as usual. Sybil had never seemed more happy, and for a moment Lord Arthur had been tempted to play the coward's part, to write to Lady Clementina for the pill, and to let the marriage go on as if there was no such person as Mr. Podgers in the world. His better nature, however, soon asserted itself, and even when Sybil flung herself weeping into his arms, he did not falter. The beauty that stirred his senses had touched his conscience also. He felt that to wreck so fair a life for the sake of a few months' pleasure would be a wrong thing to do.

He stayed with Sybil till nearly midnight, comforting her and being comforted in turn, and early the next morning he left for Venice, after writing a manly, firm letter to Mr. Merton about the necessary postponement of the marriage.





Chapter 4


In Venice he met his brother, Lord Surbiton, who happened to have come over from Corfu in his yacht. The two young men spent a delightful fortnight together. In the morning they rode on the Lido, or glided up and down the green canals in their long black gondola; in the afternoon they usually entertained visitors on the yacht; and in the evening they dined at Florian's, and smoked innumerable cigarettes on the Piazza. Yet somehow Lord Arthur was not happy. Every day he studied the obituary column in the Times, expecting to see a notice of Lady Clementina's death, but every day he was disappointed. He began to be afraid that some accident had happened to her, and often regretted that he had prevented her taking the aconitine when she had been so anxious to try its effect. Sybil's letters, too, though full of love, and trust, and tenderness, were often very sad in their tone, and sometimes he used to think that he was parted from her for ever.

After a fortnight Lord Surbiton got bored with Venice, and determined to run down the coast to Ravenna, as he heard that there was some capital cock-shooting in the Pinetum. Lord Arthur, at first, refused absolutely to come, but Surbiton, of whom he was extremely fond, finally persuaded him that if he stayed at Danielli's by himself he would be moped to death, and on the morning of the 15th they started, with a strong nor' east wind blowing, and a rather choppy sea. The sport was excellent, and the free, open-air life brought the colour back to Lord Arthur's cheeks, but about the 22nd he became anxious about Lady Clementina, and, in spite of Surbiton's remonstrances, came back to Venice by train.

As he stepped out of his gondola on to the hotel steps, the proprietor came forward to meet him with a sheaf of telegrams. Lord Arthur snatched them out of his hand, and tore them open. Everything had been quite successful. Lady Clementina had died quite suddenly on the night of the 17th!

His first thought was for Sybil, and he sent her off a telegram announcing his immediate return to London. He then ordered his valet to pack his things for the night mail, sent his gondoliers about five times their proper fare, and ran up to his sitting-room with a light step and a buoyant heart. There he found three letters waiting for him. One was from Sybil herself, full of sympathy and condolence. The others were from his mother, and from Lady Clementina's solicitor. It seemed that the old lady had dined with the Duchess that very night, had delighted every one by her wit and esprit, but had gone home somewhat early, complaining of heartburn. In the morning she was found dead in her bed, having apparently suffered no pain. Sir Mathew Reid had been sent for at once, but, of course, there was nothing to be done, and she was to be buried on the 22nd at Beauchamp Chalcote. A few days before she died she had made her will, and left Lord Arthur her little house in Curzon Street, and all her furniture, personal effects, and pictures, with the exception of her collection of miniatures, which was to go to her sister, Lady Margaret Rufford, and her amethyst necklace, which Sybil Merton was to have. The property was not of much value; but Mr. Mansfield the solicitor was extremely anxious for Lord Arthur to return at once, if possible, as there were a great many bills to be paid, and Lady Clementina had never kept any regular accounts.

Lord Arthur was very much touched by Lady Clementina's kind remembrance of him, and felt that Mr. Podgers had a great deal to answer for. His love of Sybil, however, dominated every other emotion, and the consciousness that he had done his duty gave him peace and comfort. When he arrived at Charing Cross, he felt perfectly happy.

The Mertons received him very kindly, Sybil made him promise that he would never again allow anything to come between them, and the marriage was fixed for the 7th June. Life seemed to him once more bright and beautiful, and all his old gladness came back to him again.

One day, however, as he was going over the house in Curzon Street, in company with Lady Clementina's solicitor and Sybil herself, burning packages of faded letters, and turning out drawers of odd rubbish, the young girl suddenly gave a cry of delight.

“What have you found, Sybil?” said Lord Arthur, looking up from his work, and smiling.

“This lovely little silver bonbonnière[5], Arthur. Isn't it quaint and Dutch? Do give it to me! I know amethysts won't become me till I am over eighty.”

It was the box that had held the aconitine.

Lord Arthur started, and a faint blush came into his cheek. He had almost entirely forgotten what he had done, and it seemed to him a curious coincidence that Sybil, for whose sake he had gone through all that terrible anxiety, should have been the first to remind him of it.

“Of course you can have it, Sybil. I gave it to poor Lady Clem myself.”

“Oh! thank you, Arthur; and may I have the bonbon too? I had no notion that Lady Clementina liked sweets. I thought she was far too intellectual.”

Lord Arthur grew deadly pale, and a horrible idea crossed his mind.

“Bonbon, Sybil? What do you mean?” he said in a slow, hoarse voice.

“There is one in it, that is all. It looks quite old and dusty, and I have not the slightest intention of eating it. What is the matter, Arthur? How white you look!”

Lord Arthur rushed across the room, and seized the box. Inside it was the amber-coloured capsule, with its poison-bubble. Lady Clementina had died a natural death after all!

The shock of the discovery was almost too much for him. He flung the capsule into the fire, and sank on the sofa with a cry of despair.





Chapter 5


Mr. Merton was a good deal distressed at the second postponement of the marriage, and Lady Julia, who had already ordered her dress for the wedding, did all in her power to make Sybil break off the match. Dearly, however, as Sybil loved her mother, she had given her whole life into Lord Arthur's hands, and nothing that Lady Julia could say could make her waver in her faith. As for Lord Arthur himself, it took him days to get over his terrible disappointment, and for a time his nerves were completely unstrung. His excellent common sense, however, soon asserted itself and his sound, practical mind did not leave him long in doubt about what to do. Poison having proved a complete failure, dynamite, or some other form of explosive, was obviously the proper thing to try.

He accordingly looked again over the list of his friends and relatives, and, after careful consideration, determined to blow up his uncle, the Dean of Chichester. The Dean, who was a man of great culture and learning, was extremely fond of clocks, and had a wonderful collection of timepieces, ranging from the fifteenth century to the present day, and it seemed to Lord Arthur that this hobby of the good Dean's offered him an excellent opportunity for carrying out his scheme. Where to procure an explosive machine was, of course, quite another matter. The London Directory gave him no information on the point, and he felt that there was very little use in going to Scotland Yard about it, as they never seemed to know anything about the movements of the dynamite faction till after an explosion had taken place, and not much even then.

Suddenly he thought of his friend Rouvaloff, a young Russian of very revolutionary tendencies, whom he had met at Lady Windermere's in the winter. Count Rouvaloff was supposed to be writing a life of Peter the Great, and to have come over to England for the purpose of studying the documents relating to that Tsar's residence in this country as a ship carpenter; but it was generally suspected that he was a Nihilist agent, and there was no doubt that the Russian Embassy did not look with any favour upon his presence in London. Lord Arthur felt that he was just the man for his purpose, and drove down one morning to his lodgings in Bloomsbury, to ask his advice and assistance.

“So you are taking up politics seriously?” said Count Rouvaloff, when Lord Arthur had told him the object of his mission; but Lord Arthur, who hated swagger of any kind, felt bound to admit to him that he had not the slightest interest in social questions, and simply wanted the explosive machine for a purely family matter, in which no one was concerned but himself.

Count Rouvaloff looked at him for some moments in amazement, and then seeing that he was quite serious, wrote an address on a piece of paper, initialled it, and handed it to him across the table.

“Scotland Yard would give a good deal to know this address, my dear fellow.”

“They shan't have it,” cried Lord Arthur, laughing; and after shaking the young Russian warmly by the hand he ran downstairs, examined the paper, and told the coachman to drive to Soho Square.

There he dismissed him, and strolled down Greek Street, till he came to a place called Bayle's Court. He passed under the archway, and found himself in a curious cul-de-sac, that was apparently occupied by a French Laundry, as a perfect network of clothes-lines was stretched across from house to house, and there was a flutter of white linen in the morning air. He walked right to the end, and knocked at a little green house. After some delay, during which every window became a blurred mass of peering faces, the door was opened by a rather rough-looking foreigner, who asked him in very bad English what his business was. Lord Arthur handed him the paper Count Rouvaloff had given him. When the man saw it he bowed, and invited Lord Arthur into a very shabby front parlour on the ground-floor, and in a few moments Herr Winckelkopf, as he was called in England, bustled into the room, with a very wine-stained napkin round his neck, and a fork in his left hand.

“Count Rouvaloff has given me an introduction to you,” said Lord Arthur, bowing, “and I am anxious to have a short interview with you on a matter of business. My name is Smith, Mr. Robert Smith, and I want you to supply me with an explosive clock.”

“Charmed to meet you, Lord Arthur,” said the genial little German laughing. “Don't look so alarmed, it is my duty to know everybody, and I remember seeing you one evening at Lady Windermere's. I hope her ladyship is quite well. Do you mind sitting with me while I finish my breakfast? There is an excellent paté, and my friends are kind enough to say that my Rhine wine is better than any they get at the German Embassy,” and before Lord Arthur had got over his surprise at being recognised, he found himself seated in the back-room, sipping the most delicious Marcobrunner out of a pale yellow hock-glass marked with the Imperial monogram, and chatting in the friendliest manner possible to the famous conspirator.

“Explosive clocks,” said Herr Winckelkopf, “are not very good things for foreign exportation, as, even if they succeed in passing the Custom House, the train service is so irregular, that they usually go off before they have reached their proper destination. If, however, you want one for home use, I can supply you with an excellent article, and guarantee that you will be satisfied with the result. May I ask for whom it is intended? If it is for the police, or for any one connected with Scotland Yard, I am afraid I cannot do anything for you. The English detectives are really our best friends, and I have always found that by relying on their stupidity, we can do exactly what we like. I could not spare one of them.”

“I assure you,” said Lord Arthur, “that it has nothing to do with the police at all. In fact, the clock is intended for the Dean of Chichester.”

“Dear me! I had no idea that you felt so strongly about religion, Lord Arthur. Few young men do nowadays.”

“I am afraid you overrate me, Herr Winckelkopf,” said Lord Arthur, blushing. “The fact is, I really know nothing about theology.”

“It is a purely private matter then?”

“Purely private.”

Herr Winckelkopf shrugged his shoulders, and left the room, returning in a few minutes with a round cake of dynamite about the size of a penny, and a pretty little French clock, surmounted by an ormolu figure of Liberty trampling on the hydra of Despotism.

Lord Arthur's face brightened up when he saw it. “That is just what I want,” he cried, “and now tell me how it goes off.”

“Ah! there is my secret,” answered Herr Winckelkopf, contem-plating his invention with a justifiable look of pride; “let me know when you wish it to explode, and I will set the machine to the moment.”

“Well, to-day is Tuesday, and if you could send it off at once——”

“That is impossible; I have a great deal of important work on hand for some friends of mine in Moscow. Still, I might send it off to-morrow.”

“Oh, it will be quite time enough!” said Lord Arthur politely, “if it is delivered to-morrow night or Thursday morning. For the moment of the explosion, say Friday at noon exactly. The Dean is always at home at that hour.”

“Friday, at noon,” repeated Herr Winckelkopf, and he made a note to that effect in a large ledger that was lying on a bureau near the fireplace.

“And now,” said Lord Arthur, rising from his seat, “pray let me know how much I am in your debt.”

“It is such a small matter, Lord Arthur, that I do not care to make any charge. The dynamite comes to seven and sixpence, the clock will be three pounds ten, and the carriage about five shillings. I am only too pleased to oblige any friend of Count Rouvaloff's.”

“But your trouble, Herr Winckelkopf?”

“Oh, that is nothing! It is a pleasure to me. I do not work for money; I live entirely for my art.”

Lord Arthur laid down £4 2s 6d. on the table, thanked the little German for his kindness, and, having succeeded in declining an invitation to meet some Anarchists at a meat-tea on the following Saturday, left the house and went off to the Park.

For the next two days he was in a state of the greatest excitement, and on Friday at twelve o'clock he drove down to the Buckingham to wait for news. All the afternoon the stolid hall-porter kept posting up telegrams from various parts of the country giving the results of horse-races, the verdicts in divorce suits, the state of the weather, and the like, while the tape ticked out wearisome details about an all-night sitting in the House of Commons, and a small panic on the Stock Exchange. At four o'clock the evening papers came in, and Lord Arthur disappeared into the library with the Pall Mall, the St James's, the Globe, and the Echo, to the immense indignation of Colonel Goodchild, who wanted to read the reports of a speech he had delivered that morning at the Mansion House, on the subject of South African Missions, and the advisability of having black Bishops in every province, and for some reason or other had a strong prejudice against the Evening News. None of the papers, however, contained even the slightest allusion to Chichester, and Lord Arthur felt that the attempt must have failed. It was a terrible blow to him, and for a time he was quite unnerved. Herr Winckelkopf, whom he went to see the next day, was full of elaborate apologies, and offered to supply him with another clock free of charge, or with a case of nitro-glycerine bombs at cost price. But he had lost all faith in explosives, and Herr Winckelkopf himself acknowledged that everything is so adulterated nowadays, that even dynamite can hardly be got in a pure condition. The little German, however, while admitting that something must have gone wrong with the machinery, was not without hope that the clock might still go off and instanced the case of a barometer that he had once sent to the military Governor at Odessa, which, though timed to explode in ten days, had not done so for something like three months. It was quite true that when it did go off, it merely succeeded in blowing a housemaid to atoms, the Governor having gone out of town six weeks before, but at least it showed that dynamite, as a destructive force, was, when under the control of machinery, a powerful, though somewhat unpunctual agent. Lord Arthur was a little consoled by this reflection, but even here he was destined to disappointment, for two days afterwards, as he was going upstairs, the Duchess called him into her boudoir, and showed him a letter she had just received from the Deanery.

“Jane writes charming letters,” said the Duchess; “you must really read her last. It is quite as good as the novels Mudie sends us.”

Lord Arthur seized the letter from her hand. It ran as follows:





The Deanery, Chichester,

27th May

My Dearest Aunt,

Thank you so much for the flannel for the Dorcas Society, and also for the gingham. I quite agree with you that it is nonsense their wanting to wear pretty things, but everybody is so Radical and irreligious nowadays, that it is difficult to make them see that they should not try and dress like the upper classes. I am sure I don't know what we are coming to. As papa has often said in his sermons, we live in an age of unbelief.

We have had great fun over a clock that an unknown admirer sent papa last Thursday. It arrived in a wooden box from London, carriage paid; and papa feels it must have been sent by some one who had read his remarkable sermon, ‘Is License Liberty?’ for on the top of the clock was a figure of a woman, with what papa said was the cap of Liberty on her head. I didn't think it very becoming myself, but papa said it was historical, so I suppose it is all right. Parker unpacked it, and papa put it on the mantelpiece in the library, and we were all sitting there on Friday morning, when just as the clock struck twelve, we heard a whirring noise, a little puff of smoke came from the pedestal of the figure, and the goddess of Liberty fell off, and broke her nose on the fender! Maria was quite alarmed, but it looked so ridiculous, that James and I went off into fits of laughter, and even papa was amused. When we examined it, we found it was a sort of alarum clock, and that, if you set it to a particular hour, and put some gunpowder and a cap under a little hammer, it went off whenever you wanted. Papa said it must not remain in the library, as it made a noise, so Reggie carried it away to the schoolroom, and does nothing but have small explosions all day long. Do you think Arthur would like one for a wedding present? I suppose they are quite fashionable in London. Papa says they should do a great deal of good, as they show that Liberty can't last, but must fall down. Papa says Liberty was invented at the time of the French Revolution. How awful it seems!

I have now to go to the Dorcas, where I will read your most instructive letter. How true, dear aunt, your idea is, that in their rank of life they should wear what is unbecoming. I must say it is absurd, their anxiety about dress, when there are so many more important things in this world, and in the next. I am so glad your flowered poplin turned out so well, and that your lace was not torn. I am wearing my yellow satin, that you so kindly gave me, at the Bishop's on Wednesday, and think it will look all right. Would you have bows or not? Jennings says that every one wears bows now, and that the underskirt should be frilled. Reggie has just had another explosion, and papa has ordered the clock to be sent to the stables. I don't think papa likes it so much as he did at first, though he is very flattered at being sent such a pretty and ingenious toy. It shows that people read his sermons, and profit by them.

Papa sends his love, in which James, and Reggie, and Maria all unite, and, hoping that Uncle Cecil's gout is better, believe me, dear aunt, ever your affectionate niece,





Jane Percy





PS. ——Do tell me about the bows. Jennings insists they are the fashion.





Lord Arthur looked so serious and unhappy over the letter, that the Duchess went into fits of laughter.

“My dear Arthur,” she cried, “I shall never show you a young lady's letter again! But what shall I say about the clock? I think it is a capital invention, and I should like to have one myself.”

“I don't think much of them,” said Lord Arthur, with a sad smile, and, after kissing his mother, he left the room.

When he got upstairs, he flung himself on a sofa, and his eyes filled with tears. He had done his best to commit this murder, but on both occasions he had failed, and through no fault of his own. He had tried to do his duty, but it seemed as if Destiny herself had turned traitor. He was oppressed with the sense of the barrenness of good intentions, of the futility of trying to be fine. Perhaps, it would be better to break off the marriage altogether. Sybil would suffer, it is true, but suffering could not really mar a nature so noble as hers. As for himself, what did it matter? There is always some war in which a man can die, some cause to which a man can give his life, and as life had no pleasure for him, so death had no terror. Let Destiny work out his doom. He would not stir to help her.

At half-past seven he dressed, and went down to the club. Surbiton was there with a party of young men, and he was obliged to dine with them. Their trivial conversation and idle jests did not interest him, and as soon as coffee was brought he left them, inventing some engagement in order to get away. As he was going out of the club, the hall-porter handed him a letter. It was from Herr Winckelkopf, asking him to call down the next evening, and look at an explosive umbrella, that went off as soon as it was opened. It was the very latest invention, and had just arrived from Geneva. He tore the letter up into fragments. He had made up his mind not to try any more experiments. Then he wandered down to the Thames Embankment, and sat for hours by the river. The moon peered through a mane of tawny clouds, as if it were a lion's eye, and innumerable stars spangled the hollow vault, like gold dust powdered on a purple dome. Now and then a barge swung out into the turbid stream, and floated away with the tide, and the railway signals changed from green to scarlet as the trains ran shrieking across the bridge. After some time, twelve o'clock boomed from the tall tower at Westminster and at each stroke of the sonorous bell the night seemed to tremble. Then the railway lights went out, one solitary lamp left gleaming like a large ruby on a giant mast, and the roar of the city became fainter.

At two o'clock he got up, and strolled towards Blackfriars. How unreal everything looked! How like a strange dream! The houses on the other side of the river seemed built out of darkness. One would have said that silver and shadow had fashioned the world anew. The huge dome of St. Paul's loomed like a bubble through the dusky air.

As he approached Cleopatra's Needle he saw a man leaning over the parapet, and as he came nearer the man looked up, the gaslight falling full upon his face.

It was Mr. Podgers, the chiromantist! No one could mistake the fat, flabby face, the gold-rimmed spectacles, the sickly feeble smile, the sensual mouth.

Lord Arthur stopped. A brilliant idea flashed across him, and he stole softly up behind. In a moment he had seized Mr. Podgers by the legs, and flung him into the Thames. There was a coarse oath, a heavy splash, and all was still. Lord Arthur looked anxiously over, but could see nothing of the chiromantist but a tall hat, pirouetting in an eddy of moonlit water. After a time it also sank, and no trace of Mr. Podgers was visible. Once he thought that he caught sight of the bulky misshapen figure striking out for the staircase by the bridge, and a horrible feeling of failure came over him, but it turned out to be merely a reflection, and when the moon shone out from behind a cloud it passed away. At last he seemed to have realised the decree of destiny. He heaved a deep sigh of relief, and Sybil's name came to his lips.

“Have you dropped anything, sir?” said a voice behind him suddenly.

He turned round, and saw a policeman with a bull's-eye lantern.

“Nothing of importance, sergeant,” he answered, smiling, and hailing a passing hansom, he jumped in, and told the man to drive to Belgrave Square.

For the next few days he alternated between hope and fear. There were moments when he almost expected Mr. Podgers to walk into the room, and yet at other times he felt that Fate could not be so unjust to him. Twice he went to the chiromantist's address in West Moon Street, but he could not bring himself to ring the bell. He longed for certainty, and was afraid of it.

Finally it came. He was sitting in the smoking-room of the club having tea, and listening rather wearily to Surbiton's account of the last comic song at the Gaiety, when the waiter came in with the evening papers. He took up the St. James's, and was listlessly turning over its pages, when this strange heading caught his eye:





SUICIDE OF A CHIROMANTIST.





He turned pale with excitement, and began to read. The paragraph ran as follows:





Yesterday morning, at seven o'clock, the body of Mr. Septimus R. Podgers, the eminent chiromantist, was washed on shore at Greenwich, just in front of the Ship Hotel. The unfortunate gentleman had been missing for some days, and considerable anxiety for his safety had been felt in chiromantic circles. It is supposed that he committed suicide under the influence of a temporary mental derangement, caused by overwork, and a verdict to that effect was returned this afternoon by the coroner's jury. Mr. Podgers had just completed an elaborate treatise on the subject of the Human Hand, that will shortly be published when it will no doubt attract much attention. The deceased was sixty-five years of age, and does not seem to have left any relations.





Lord Arthur rushed out of the club with the paper still in his hand, to the immense amazement of the hall-porter, who tried in vain to stop him, and drove at once to Park Lane. Sybil saw him from the window, and something told her that he was the bearer of good news. She ran down to meet him, and, when she saw his face, she knew that all was well.

“My dear Sybil,” cried Lord Arthur, “let us be married tomorrow!”

“You foolish boy! Why, the cake is not even ordered!” said Sybil, laughing through her tears.





Chapter 6


When the wedding took place, some three weeks later, St. Peter's was crowded with a perfect mob of smart people. The service was read in the most impressive manner by the Dean of Chichester, and everybody agreed that they had never seen a handsomer couple than the bride and bridegroom. They were more than handsome, however —— they were happy. Never for a single moment did Lord Arthur regret all that he had suffered for Sybil's sake, while she, on her side, gave him the best things a woman can give to any man——worship, tenderness, and love. For them romance was not killed by reality. They always felt young.

Some years afterwards, when two beautiful children had been born to them, Lady Windermere came down on a visit to Alton Priory, a lovely old place, that had been the Duke's wedding present to his son; and one afternoon as she was sitting with Lady Arthur under a lime-tree in the garden, watching the little boy and girl as they played up and down the rose-walk, like fitful sunbeams, she suddenly took her hostess's hand in hers, and said, “Are you happy, Sybil?”

“Dear Lady Windermere, of course I am happy. Aren't you?”

“I have no time to be happy, Sybil. I always like the last person who is introduced to me; but, as a rule, as soon as I know people I get tired of them.”

“Don't your lions satisfy you, Lady Windermere?”

“Oh dear, no! lions are only good for one season. As soon as their manes are cut, they are the dullest creatures going. Besides, they behave very badly, if you are really nice to them. Do you remember that horrid Mr. Podgers? He was a dreadful impostor. Of course, I didn't mind that at all, and even when he wanted to borrow money I forgave him, but I could not stand his making love to me. He has really made me hate cheiromancy. I go in for telepathy now. It is much more amusing.”

“You mustn't say anything against cheiromancy here, Lady Windermere; it is the only subject that Arthur does not like people to chaff about. I assure you he is quite serious over it.”

“You don't mean to say that he believes in it, Sybil?”

“Ask him, Lady Windermere, here he is;” and Lord Arthur came up the garden with a large bunch of yellow roses in his hand, and his two children dancing round him.

“Lord Arthur?”

“Yes, Lady Windermere.”

“You don't mean to say that you believe in cheiromancy?”

“Of course I do,” said the young man, smiling.

“But why?”

“Because I owe to it all the happiness of my life,” he murmured, throwing himself into a wicker chair.

“My dear Lord Arthur, what do you owe to it?”

“Sybil,” he answered, handing his wife the roses, and looking into her violet eyes.

“What nonsense!” cried Lady Windermere. “I never heard such nonsense in all my life.”

THE CANTERVILLE GHOST

A Hylo-Idealistic Romance


Chapter 1


When Mr. Hiram B. Otis, the American minister, bought Canterville Chase, every one told him he was doing a very foolish thing, as there was no doubt at all that the place was haunted. Indeed, Lord Canterville himself, who was a man of the most punctilious honour, had felt it his duty to mention the fact to Mr. Otis when they came to discuss terms.

“We have not cared to live in the place ourselves,” said Lord Canterville, “since my grand-aunt, the Dowager Duchess of Bolton, was frightened into a fit, from which she never really recovered, by two skeleton hands being placed on her shoulders as she was dressing for dinner, and I feel bound to tell you, Mr. Otis, that the ghost has been seen by several living members of my family, as well as by the rector of the parish, the Rev. Augustus Dampier, who is a fellow of King's College, Cambridge. After the unfortunate accident to the Duchess, none of our younger servants would stay with us, and Lady Canterville often got very little sleep at night, in consequence of the mysterious noises that came from the corridor and the library.”

“My Lord,” answered the Minister, “I will take the furniture and the ghost at a valuation. I come from a modern country, where we have everything that money can buy; and with all our spry young fellows painting the Old World red, and carrying off your best actresses and prima-donnas, I reckon that if there were such a thing as a ghost in Europe, we'd have it at home in a very short time in one of our public museums, or on the road as a show.”

“I fear that the ghost exists,” said Lord Canterville, smiling, “though it may have resisted the overtures of your enterprising impresarios. It has been well known for three centuries, since 1584 in fact, and always makes its appearance before the death of any member of our family.”

“Well, so does the family doctor for that matter, Lord Canterville. But there is no such thing, sir, as a ghost, and I guess the laws of nature are not going to be suspended for the British aristocracy.”

“You are certainly very natural in America,” answered Lord Canterville, who did not quite understand Mr. Otis's last observation, “and if you don't mind a ghost in the house, it is all right. Only you must remember I warned you.”

A few weeks after this, the purchase was completed, and at the close of the season the Minister and his family went down to Canterville Chase. Mrs. Otis, who, as Miss Lucretia R. Tappan, of West 53rd Street, had been a celebrated New York belle, was now a very handsome middle-aged woman, with fine eyes, and a superb profile. Many American ladies on leaving their native land adopt an appearance of chronic ill-health, under the impression that it is a form of European refinement, but Mrs. Otis had never fallen into this error. She had a magnificent constitution, and a really wonderful amount of animal spirits. Indeed, in many respects, she was quite English, and was an excellent example of the fact that we have really everything in common with America nowadays, except, of course, language. Her eldest son, christened Washington by his parents in a moment of patriotism, which he never ceased to regret, was a fair-haired, rather good-looking young man, who had qualified himself for American diplomacy by leading the German at the Newport Casino for three successive seasons, and even in London was well known as an excellent dancer. Gardenias and the peerage were his only weaknesses. Otherwise he was extremely sensible. Miss Virginia E. Otis was a little girl of fifteen, lithe and lovely as a fawn, and with a fine freedom in her large blue eyes. She was a wonderful amazon, and had once raced old Lord Bilton on her pony twice round the park, winning by a length and a half, just in front of Achilles statue, to the huge delight of the young Duke of Cheshire, who proposed to her on the spot, and was sent back to Eton that very night by his guardians, in floods of tears. After Virginia came the twins, who were usually called “The Stars and Stripes,” as they were always getting swished. They were delightful boys, and with the exception of the worthy Minister the only true republicans of the family.

As Canterville Chase is seven miles from Ascot, the nearest railway station, Mr. Otis had telegraphed for a waggonette to meet them, and they started on their drive in high spirits. It was a lovely July evening, and the air was delicate with the scent of the pinewoods. Now and then they heard a wood pigeon brooding over its own sweet voice, or saw, deep in the rustling fern, the burnished breast of the pheasant. Little squirrels peered at them from the beech-trees as they went by, and the rabbits scudded away through the brushwood and over the mossy knolls, with their white tails in the air. As they entered the avenue of Canterville Chase, however, the sky became suddenly overcast with clouds, a curious stillness seemed to hold the atmosphere, a great flight of rooks passed silently over their heads, and, before they reached the house, some big drops of rain had fallen.

Standing on the steps to receive them was an old woman, neatly dressed in black silk, with a white cap and apron. This was Mrs. Umney, the housekeeper, whom Mrs. Otis, at Lady Canterville's earnest request, had consented to keep on in her former position. She made them each a low curtsey as they alighted, and said in a quaint, old-fashioned manner, “I bid you welcome to Canterville Chase.” Following her, they passed through the fine Tudor hall into the library, a long, low room, panelled in black oak, at the end of which was a large stained-glass window. Here they found tea laid out for them, and, after taking off their wraps, they sat down and began to look round, while Mrs. Umney waited on them.

Suddenly Mrs. Otis caught sight of a dull red stain on the floor just by the fireplace and, quite unconscious of what it really signified, said to Mrs. Umney, “I am afraid something has been spilt there.”

“Yes, madam,” replied the old housekeeper in a low voice, “blood has been spilt on that spot.”

“How horrid,” cried Mrs. Otis; “I don't at all care for bloodstains in a sitting-room. It must be removed at once.”

The old woman smiled, and answered in the same low, mysterious voice, “It is the blood of Lady Eleanore de Canterville, who was murdered on that very spot by her own husband, Sir Simon de Canterville, in 1575. Sir Simon survived her nine years, and disappeared suddenly under very mysterious circumstances. His body has never been discovered, but his guilty spirit still haunts the Chase. The blood-stain has been much admired by tourists and others, and cannot be removed.”

“That is all nonsense,” cried Washington Otis; “Pinkerton's Champion Stain Remover and Paragon Detergent will clean it up in no time,” and before the terrified housekeeper could interfere he had fallen upon his knees, and was rapidly scouring the floor with a small stick of what looked like a black cosmetic. In a few moments no trace of the blood-stain could be seen.

“I knew Pinkerton would do it,” he exclaimed triumphantly, as he looked round at his admiring family; but no sooner had he said these words than a terrible flash of lightning lit up the sombre room, a fearful peal of thunder made them all start to their feet, and Mrs. Umney fainted.

“What a monstrous climate!” said the American Minister calmly, as he lit a long cheroot. “I guess the old country is so over-populated that they have not enough decent weather for everybody. I have always been of opinion that emigration is the only thing for England.”

“My dear Hiram,” cried Mrs. Otis, “what can we do with a woman who faints?”

“Charge it to her like breakages,” answered the Minister; “she won't faint after that;” and in a few moments Mrs. Umney certainly came to. There was no doubt, however, that she was extremely upset, and she sternly warned Mr. Otis to beware of some trouble coming to the house.

“I have seen things with my own eyes, sir,” she said, “that would make any Christian's hair stand on end, and many and many a night I have not closed my eyes in sleep for the awful things that are done here.” Mr. Otis, however, and his wife warmly assured the honest soul that they were not afraid of ghosts, and, after invoking the blessings of Providence on her new master and mistress, and making arrangements for an increase of salary, the old housekeeper tottered off to her own room.





Chapter 2


The storm raged fiercely all that night, but nothing of particular note occurred. The next morning, however, when they came down to breakfast, they found the terrible stain of blood once again on the floor. “I don't think it can be the fault of the Paragon Detergent,” said Washington, “for I have tried it with everything. It must be the ghost.” He accordingly rubbed out the stain a second time, but the second morning it appeared again. The third morning also it was there, though the library had been locked up at night by Mr. Otis himself, and the key carried upstairs. The whole family were now quite interested; Mr. Otis began to suspect that he had been too dogmatic in his denial of the existence of ghosts, Mrs. Otis expressed her intention of joining the Psychical Society, and Washington prepared a long letter to Messrs. Myers and Podmore on the subject of the Permanence of Sanguineous Stains when connected with Crime. That night all doubts about the objective existence of phantasmata were removed for ever.

The day had been warm and sunny; and, in the cool of the evening, the whole family went out for a drive. They did not return home till nine o'clock, when they had a light supper. The conversation in no way turned upon ghosts, so there were not even those primary conditions of receptive expectation which so often precede the presentation of psychical phenomena. The subjects discussed, as I have since learned from Mr. Otis, were merely such as form the ordinary conversation of cultured Americans of the better class, such as the immense superiority of Miss Fanny Davenport over Sara Bernhardt as an actress; the difficulty of obtaining green corn, buckwheat cakes, and hominy, even in the best English houses; the importance of Boston in the development of the world-soul; the advantages of the baggage check system in railway travelling; and the sweetness of the New York accent as compared to the London drawl. No mention at all was made of the supernatural, nor was Sir Simon de Canterville alluded to in any way. At eleven o'clock the family retired, and by half-past all the lights were out. Some time after, Mr. Otis was awakened by a curious noise in the corridor, outside his room. It sounded like the clank of metal, and seemed to be coming nearer every moment. He got up at once, struck a match, and looked at the time. It was exactly one o'clock. He was quite calm, and felt his pulse, which was not at all feverish. The strange noise still continued, and with it he heard distinctly the sound of footsteps. He put on his slippers, took a small oblong phial out of his dressing-case, and opened the door. Right in front of him he saw, in the wan moonlight, an old man of terrible aspect. His eyes were as red as burning coals; long grey hair fell over his shoulders in matted coils; his garments, which were of antique cut, were soiled and ragged, and from his wrists and ankles hung heavy manacles and rusty gyves.

“My dear sir,” said Mr. Otis, “I really must insist on your oiling those chains, and have brought you for that purpose a small bottle of the Tammany Rising Sun Lubricator. It is said to be completely efficacious upon one application, and there are several testimonials to that effect on the wrapper from some of our most eminent native divines. I shall leave it here for you by the bedroom candles, and will be happy to supply you with more should you require it.” With these words the United States Minister laid the bottle down on a marble table, and, closing his door, retired to rest.

For a moment the Canterville ghost stood quite motionless in natural indignation; then, dashing the bottle violently upon the polished floor, he fled down the corridor, uttering hollow groans, and emitting a ghastly green light. Just, however, as he reached the top of the great oak staircase, a door was flung open, two little white-robed figures appeared, and a large pillow whizzed past his head! There was evidently no time to be lost, so, hastily adopting the Fourth Dimension of Space as a means of escape, he vanished through the wainscoting, and the house became quite quiet.

On reaching a small secret chamber in the left wing, he leaned up against a moonbeam to recover his breath, and began to try and realise his position. Never, in a brilliant and uninterrupted career of three hundred years, had he been so grossly insulted. He thought of the Dowager Duchess, whom he had frightened into a fit as she stood before the glass in her lace and diamonds; of the four housemaids, who had gone off into hysterics when he merely grinned at them through the curtains of one of the spare bedrooms; of the rector of the parish, whose candle he had blown out as he was coming late one night from the library, and who had been under the care of Sir William Gull ever since, a perfect martyr to nervous disorders; and of old Madame de Tremouillac, who, having wakened up one morning early and seen a skeleton seated in an arm-chair by the fire reading her diary, had been confined to her bed for six weeks with an attack of brain fever, and, on her recovery, had become reconciled to the Church, and had broken off her connection with that notorious sceptic Monsieur de Voltaire. He remembered the terrible night when the wicked Lord Canterville was found choking in his dressing-room, with the knave of diamonds half-way down his throat, and confessed, just before he died, that he had cheated Charles James Fox out of £50,000 at Crockford's by means of that very card, and swore that the ghost had made him swallow it. All his great achievements came back to him again, from the butler who had shot himself in the pantry because he had seen a green hand tapping at the window pane, to the beautiful Lady Stutfield, who was always obliged to wear a black velvet band round her throat to hide the mark of five fingers burnt upon her white skin, and who drowned herself at last in the carp-pond at the end of the King's Walk. With the enthusiastic egotism of the true artist he went over his most celebrated performances, and smiled bitterly to himself as he recalled to mind his last appearance as “Red Reuben, or the Strangled Babe,” his début as “Gaunt Gibeon, the Blood-sucker of Bexley Moor,” and the furore he had excited one lovely June evening by merely playing ninepins with his own bones upon the lawn-tennis ground. And after all this, some wretched modern Americans were to come and offer him the Rising Sun Lubricator, and throw pillows at his head! It was quite unbearable. Besides, no ghost in history had ever been treated in this manner. Accordingly, he determined to have vengeance, and remained till daylight in an attitude of deep thought.





Chapter 3


The next morning, when the Otis family met at breakfast, they discussed the ghost at some length. The United States Minister was naturally a little annoyed to find that his present had not been accepted. “I have no wish,” he said, “to do the ghost any personal injury, and I must say that, considering the length of time he has been in the house, I don't think it is at all polite to throw pillows at him”——a very just remark, at which, I am sorry to say, the twins burst into shouts of laughter. “Upon the other hand,” he continued, “if he really declines to use the Rising Sun Lubricator, we shall have to take his chains from him. It would be quite impossible to sleep, with such a noise going on outside the bedrooms.”

For the rest of the week, however, they were undisturbed, the only thing that excited any attention being the continual renewal of the blood-stain on the library floor. This certainly was very strange, as the door was always locked at night by Mr. Otis, and the windows kept closely barred. The chameleon-like colour, also, of the stain excited a good deal of comment. Some mornings it was a dull (almost Indian) red, then it would be vermilion, then a rich purple, and once when they came down for family prayers, according to the simple rites of the Free American Reformed Episcopalian Church, they found it a bright emerald green. These kaleidoscopic changes naturally amused the party very much, and bets on the subject were freely made every evening. The only person who did not enter into the joke was little Virginia, who, for some unexplained reason, was always a good deal distressed at the sight of the blood-stain, and very nearly cried the morning it was emerald-green.

The second appearance of the ghost was on Sunday night. Shortly after they had gone to bed they were suddenly alarmed by a fearful crash in the hall. Rushing downstairs, they found that a large suit of old armour had become detached from its stand, and had fallen on the stone floor, while, seated in a high-backed chair, was the Canterville ghost, rubbing his knees with an expression of acute agony on his face. The twins, having brought their peashooters with them, at once discharged two pellets on him, with that accuracy of aim which can only be attained by long and careful practice on a writing-master, while the United States Minister covered him with his revolver, and called upon him, in accordance with Californian etiquette, to hold up his hands! The ghost started up with a wild shriek of rage, and swept through them like a mist, extinguishing Washington Otis's candle as he passed, and so leaving them all in total darkness. On reaching the top of the staircase he recovered himself, and determined to give his celebrated peal of demoniac laughter. This he had on more than one occasion found extremely useful. It was said to have turned Lord Raker's wig grey in a single night, and had certainly made three of Lady Canterville's French governesses give warning before their month was up. He accordingly laughed his most horrible laugh, till the old vaulted roof rang and rang again, but hardly had the fearful echo died away when a door opened, and Mrs. Otis came out in a light blue dressing-gown. “I am afraid you are far from well,” she said, “and have brought you a bottle of Dr. Dobell's tincture. If it is indigestion, you will find it a most excellent remedy.” The ghost glared at her in fury, and began at once to make preparations for turning himself into a large black dog, an accomplishment for which he was justly renowned, and to which the family doctor always attributed the permanent idiocy of Lord Canterville's uncle, the Hon. Thomas Horton. The sound of approaching footsteps, however, made him hesitate in his fell purpose, so he contented himself with becoming faintly phosphorescent, and vanished with a deep churchyard groan, just as the twins had come up to him.

On reaching his room he entirely broke down, and became a prey to the most violent agitation. The vulgarity of the twins, and the gross materialism of Mrs. Otis, were naturally extremely annoying, but what really distressed him most was, that he had been unable to wear the suit of mail. He had hoped that even modern Americans would be thrilled by the sight of a Spectre In Armour, if for no more sensible reason, at least out of respect for their national poet Longfellow, over whose graceful and attractive poetry he himself had whiled away many a weary hour when the Cantervilles were up in town. Besides, it was his own suit. He had worn it with success at the Kenilworth tournament, and had been highly complimented on it by no less a person than the Virgin Queen herself. Yet when he had put it on, he had been completely overpowered by the weight of the huge breastplate and steel casque, and had fallen heavily on the stone pavement, barking both his knees severely, and bruising the knuckles of his right hand.

For some days after this he was extremely ill, and hardly stirred out of his room at all, except to keep the blood-stain in proper repair. However, by taking great care of himself, he recovered, and resolved to make a third attempt to frighten the United States Minister and his family. He selected Friday, the 17th of August, for his appearance, and spent most of that day in looking over his wardrobe, ultimately deciding in favour of a large slouched hat with a red feather, a winding-sheet frilled at the wrists and neck, and a rusty dagger. Towards evening a violent storm of rain came on, and the wind was so high that all the windows and doors in the old house shook and rattled. In fact, it was just such weather as he loved. His plan of action was this. He was to make his way quietly to Washington Otis's room, gibber at him from the foot of the bed, and stab himself three times in the throat to the sound of slow music. He bore Washington a special grudge, being quite aware that it was he who was in the habit of removing the famous Canterville blood-stain, by means of Pinkerton's Paragon Detergent. Having reduced the reckless and foolhardy youth to a condition of abject terror, he was then to proceed to the room occupied by the United States Minister and his wife, and there to place a clammy hand on Mrs. Otis's forehead, while he hissed into her trembling husband's ear the awful secrets of the charnel-house. With regard to little Virginia, he had not quite made up his mind. She had never insulted him in any way, and was pretty and gentle. A few hollow groans from the wardrobe, he thought, would be more than sufficient, or, if that failed to wake her, he might grabble at the counterpane with palsy-twitching fingers. As for the twins, he was quite determined to teach them a lesson. The first thing to be done was, of course, to sit upon their chests, so as to produce the stifling sensation of nightmare. Then, as their beds were quite close to each other, to stand between them in the form of a green, icy-cold corpse, till they became paralysed with fear, and finally, to throw off the winding-sheet, and crawl round the room, with white, bleached bones and one rolling eyeball, in the character of “Dumb Daniel, or the Suicide's Skeleton,” a rôle in which he had on more than one occasion produced a great effect, and which he considered quite equal to his famous part of “Martin the Maniac, or the Masked Mystery.”

At half-past ten he heard the family going to bed. For some time he was disturbed by wild shrieks of laughter from the twins, who, with the light-hearted gaiety of schoolboys, were evidently amusing themselves before they retired to rest, but at a quarter-past eleven all was still, and, as midnight sounded, he sallied forth. The owl beat against the window panes, the raven croaked from the old yewtree, and the wind wandered moaning round the house like a lost soul; but the Otis family slept unconscious of their doom, and high above the rain and storm he could hear the steady snoring of the Minister for the United States. He stepped stealthily out of the wainscoting, with an evil smile on his cruel, wrinkled mouth, and the moon hid her face in a cloud as he stole past the great oriel window, where his own arms and those of his murdered wife were blazoned in azure and gold. On and on he glided, like an evil shadow, the very darkness seeming to loathe him as he passed. Once he thought he heard something call, and stopped; but it was only the baying of a dog from the Red Farm, and he went on, muttering strange sixteenth-century curses, and ever and anon brandishing the rusty dagger in the midnight air. Finally he reached the corner of the passage that led to luckless Washington's room. For a moment he paused there, the wind blowing his long grey locks about his head, and twisting into grotesque and fantastic folds the nameless horror of the dead man's shroud. Then the clock struck the quarter, and he felt the time was come. He chuckled to himself, and turned the corner; but no sooner had he done so, than, with a piteous wail of terror, he fell back, and hid his blanched face in his long, bony hands. Right in front of him was standing a horrible spectre, motionless as a carven image, and monstrous as a madman's dream! Its head was bald and burnished; its face round, and fat, and white; and hideous laughter seemed to have writhed its features into an eternal grin. From the eyes streamed rays of scarlet light, the mouth was a wide well of fire, and a hideous garment, like to his own, swathed with its silent snows the Titan form. On its breast was a placard with strange writing in antique characters, some scroll of shame it seemed, some record of wild sins, some awful calendar of crime, and, with its right hand, it bore aloft a falchion of gleaming steel.

Never having seen a ghost before, he naturally was terribly frightened, and, after a second hasty glance at the awful phantom, he fled back to his room, tripping up in his long winding sheet as he sped down the corridor, and finally dropping the rusty dagger into the Minister's jack-boots, where it was found in the morning by the butler. Once in the privacy of his own apartment, he flung himself down on a small pallet-bed, and hid his face under the clothes. After a time, however, the brave old Canterville spirit asserted itself, and he determined to go and speak to the other ghost as soon as it was daylight. Accordingly, just as the dawn was touching the hills with silver, he returned towards the spot where he had first laid eyes on the grisly phantom, feeling that, after all, two ghosts were better than one, and that, by the aid of his new friend, he might safely grapple with the twins. On reaching the spot, however, a terrible sight met his gaze. Something had evidently happened to the spectre, for the light had entirely faded from its hollow eyes, the gleaming falchion had fallen from its hand, and it was leaning up against the wall in a strained and uncomfortable attitude. He rushed forward and seized it in his arms, when, to his horror, the head slipped off and rolled on the floor, the body assumed a recumbent posture, and he found himself clasping a white dimity bed-curtain, with a sweeping-brush, a kitchen cleaver, and a hollow turnip lying at his feet! Unable to understand this curious transformation, he clutched the placard with feverish haste, and there, in the grey morning light, he read these fearful words:





YE OTIS GHOSTE

Ye Onlie True and Originale Spook

Beware of Ye Imitationes

All others are Counterfeite





The whole thing flashed across him. He had been tricked, foiled, and outwitted! The old Canterville look came into his eyes; he ground his toothless gums together; and, raising his withered hands high above his head, swore, according to the picturesque phraseology of the antique school, that when Chanticleer had sounded twice his merry horn, deeds of blood would be wrought, and Murder walk abroad with silent feet.

Hardly had he finished this awful oath when, from the red-tiled roof of a distant homestead, a cock crew. He laughed a long, low, bitter laugh, and waited. Hour after hour he waited, but the cock, for some strange reason, did not crow again. Finally, at half-past seven, the arrival of the housemaids made him give up his fearful vigil, and he stalked back to his room, thinking of his vain oath and baffled purpose. There he consulted several books of ancient chivalry, of which he was exceedingly fond, and found that, on every occasion on which his oath had been used, Chanticleer had always crowed a second time. “Perdition seize the naughty fowl,” he muttered, “I have seen the day when, with my stout spear, I would have run him through the gorge, and made him crow for me an 'twere in death!” He then retired to a comfortable lead coffin, and stayed there till evening.





Chapter 4


The next day the ghost was very weak and tired. The terrible excitement of the last four weeks was beginning to have its effect. His nerves were completely shattered, and he started at the slightest noise. For five days he kept his room, and at last made up his mind to give up the point of the blood-stain on the library floor. If the Otis family did not want it, they clearly did not deserve it. They were evidently people on a low, material plane of existence, and quite incapable of appreciating the symbolic value of sensuous phenomena. The question of phantasmic apparitions, and the development of astral bodies, was of course quite a different matter, and really not under his control. It was his solemn duty to appear in the corridor once a week, and to gibber from the large oriel window on the first and third Wednesdays in every month, and he did not see how he could honourably escape from his obligations. It is quite true that his life had been very evil, but, upon the other hand, he was most conscientious in all things connected with the supernatural. For the next three Saturdays, accordingly, he traversed the corridor as usual between midnight and three o'clock, taking every possible precaution against being either heard or seen. He removed his boots, trod as lightly as possible on the old worm-eaten boards, wore a large black velvet cloak, and was careful to use the Rising Sun Lubricator for oiling his chains. I am bound to acknowledge that it was with a good deal of difficulty that he brought himself to adopt this last mode of protection. However, one night, while the family were at dinner, he slipped into Mr. Otis's bedroom and carried off the bottle. He felt a little humiliated at first, but afterwards was sensible enough to see that there was a great deal to be said for the invention, and, to a certain degree, it served his purpose. Still, in spite of everything, he was not left unmolested. Strings were continually being stretched across the corridor, over which he tripped in the dark, and on one occasion, while dressed for the part of “Black Isaac, or the Huntsman of Hogley Woods,” he met with a severe fall, through treading on a butter-slide, which the twins had constructed from the entrance of the Tapestry Chamber to the top of the oak staircase. This last insult so enraged him, that he resolved to make one final effort to assert his dignity and social position, and determined to visit the insolent young Etonians the next night in his celebrated character of “Reckless Rupert, or the Headless Earl.”

He had not appeared in this disguise for more than seventy years; in fact, not since he had so frightened pretty Lady Barbara Modish by means of it, that she suddenly broke off her engagement with the present Lord Canterville's grandfather, and ran away to Gretna Green with handsome Jack Castleton, declaring that nothing in the world would induce her to marry into a family that allowed such a horrible phantom to walk up and down the terrace at twilight. Poor Jack was afterwards shot in a duel by Lord Canterville on Wandsworth Common, and Lady Barbara died of a broken heart at Tunbridge Wells before the year was out, so, in every way, it had been a great success. It was, however, an extremely difficult “make-up,” if I may use such a theatrical expression in connection with one of the greatest mysteries of the supernatural, or, to employ a more scientific term, the higher-natural world, and it took him fully three hours to make his preparations. At last everything was ready, and he was very pleased with his appearance. The big leather riding-boots that went with the dress were just a little too large for him, and he could only find one of the two horse-pistols, but, on the whole, he was quite satisfied, and at a quarter-past one he glided out of the wainscoting and crept down the corridor. On reaching the room occupied by the twins, which I should mention was called the Blue Bed Chamber, on account of the colour of its hangings, he found the door just ajar. Wishing to make an effective entrance, he flung it wide open, when a heavy jug of water fell right down on him, wetting him to the skin, and just missing his left shoulder by a couple of inches. At the same moment he heard stifled shrieks of laughter proceeding from the four-post bed. The shock to his nervous system was so great that he fled back to his room as hard as he could go, and the next day he was laid up with a severe cold. The only thing that at all consoled him in the whole affair was the fact that he had not brought his head with him, for, had he done so, the consequences might have been very serious.

He now gave up all hope of ever frightening this rude American family, and contented himself, as a rule, with creeping about the passages in list slippers, with a thick red muffler round his throat for fear of draughts, and a small arquebuse, in case he should be attacked by the twins. The final blow he received occurred on the 19th of September. He had gone downstairs to the great entrance-hall, feeling sure that there, at any rate, he would be quite unmolested, and was amusing himself by making satirical remarks on the large Saroni photographs of the United States Minister and his wife, which had now taken the place of the Canterville family pictures. He was simply but neatly clad in a long shroud, spotted with churchyard mould, had tied up his jaw with a strip of yellow linen, and carried a small lantern and a sexton's spade. In fact, he was dressed for the character of “Jonas the Graveless, or the Corpse-Snatcher of Chertsey Barn,” one of his most remarkable impersonations, and one which the Cantervilles had every reason to remember, as it was the real origin of their quarrel with their neighbour, Lord Rufford. It was about a quarter past two o'clock in the morning, and, as far as he could ascertain, no one was stirring. As he was strolling towards the library, however, to see if there were any traces left of the blood-stain, suddenly there leaped out on him from a dark corner two figures, who waved their arms wildly above their heads, and shrieked out “BOO!” in his ear.

Seized with a panic, which, under the circumstances, was only natural, he rushed for the staircase, but found Washington Otis waiting for him there with the big garden-syringe; and being thus hemmed in by his enemies on every side, and driven almost to bay, he vanished into the great iron stove, which, fortunately for him, was not lit, and had to make his way home through the flues and chimneys, arriving at his own room in a terrible state of dirt, disorder, and despair.

After this he was not seen again on any nocturnal expedition. The twins lay in wait for him on several occasions, and strewed the passages with nutshells every night to the great annoyance of their parents and the servants, but it was of no avail. It was quite evident that his feelings were so wounded that he would not appear. Mr. Otis consequently resumed his great work on the history of the Democratic Party, on which he had been engaged for some years; Mrs. Otis organised a wonderful clambake, which amazed the whole county; the boys took to lacrosse, euchre, poker, and other American national games; and Virginia rode about the lanes on her pony, accompanied by the young Duke of Cheshire, who had come to spend the last week of his holidays at Canterville Chase. It was generally assumed that the ghost had gone away, and, in fact, Mr. Otis wrote a letter to that effect to Lord Canterville, who, in reply, expressed his great pleasure at the news, and sent his best congratulations to the Minister's worthy wife.

The Otises, however, were deceived, for the ghost was still in the house, and though now almost an invalid, was by no means ready to let matters rest, particularly as he heard that among the guests was the young Duke of Cheshire, whose grand-uncle, Lord Francis Stilton, had once bet a hundred guineas with Colonel Carbury that he would play dice with the Canterville ghost, and was found the next morning lying on the floor of the card-room in such a helpless paralytic state, that though he lived on to a great age, he was never able to say anything again but “Double Sixes.” The story was well known at the time, though, of course, out of respect to the feelings of the two noble families, every attempt was made to hush it up; and a full account of all the circumstances connected with it will be found in the third volume of Lord Tattle's Recollections of the Prince Regent and his Friends. The ghost, then, was naturally very anxious to show that he had not lost his influence over the Stiltons, with whom, indeed, he was distantly connected, his own first cousin having been married en secondes noces[1] to the Sieur de Bulkeley, from whom, as every one knows, the Dukes of Cheshire are lineally descended. Accordingly, he made arrangements for appearing to Virginia's little lover in his celebrated impersonation of “The Vampire Monk, or, the Bloodless Benedictine,” a performance so horrible that when old Lady Startup saw it, which she did on one fatal New Year's Eve, in the year 1764, she went off into the most piercing shrieks, which culminated in violent apoplexy, and died in three days, after disinheriting the Cantervilles, who were her nearest relations, and leaving all her money to her London apothecary. At the last moment, however, his terror of the twins prevented his leaving his room, and the little Duke slept in peace under the great feathered canopy in the Royal Bedchamber, and dreamed of Virginia.





Chapter 5


A few days after this, Virginia and her curly-haired cavalier went out riding on Brockley meadows, where she tore her habit so badly in getting through a hedge, that, on their return home, she made up her mind to go up by the back staircase so as not to be seen. As she was running past the Tapestry Chamber, the door of which happened to be opened, she fancied she saw some one inside, and thinking it was her mother's maid, who sometimes used to bring her work there, looked in to ask her to mend her habit. To her immense surprise, however, it was the Canterville Ghost himself! He was sitting by the window, watching the ruined gold of the yellowing trees fly through the air, and the red leaves dancing madly down the long avenue. His head was leaning on his hand, and his whole attitude was one of extreme depression. Indeed, so forlorn, and so much out of repair did he look, that little Virginia, whose first idea had been to run away and lock herself in her room, was filled with pity, and determined to try and comfort him. So light was her footfall, and so deep his melancholy, that he was not aware of her presence till she spoke to him.

“I am so sorry for you,” she said, “but my brothers are going back to Eton to-morrow, and then, if you behave yourself, no one will annoy you.”

“It is absurd asking me to behave myself,” he answered, looking round in astonishment at the pretty little girl who had ventured to address him, “quite absurd. I must rattle my chains, and groan through keyholes, and walk about at night, if that is what you mean. It is my only reason for existing.”

“It is no reason at all for existing, and you know you have been very wicked. Mrs. Umney told us, the first day we arrived here, that you had killed your wife.”

“Well, I quite admit it,” said the Ghost petulantly, “but it was a purely family matter, and concerned no one else.”

“It is very wrong to kill any one,” said Virginia, who at times had a sweet Puritan gravity, caught from some old New England ancestor.

“Oh, I hate the cheap severity of abstract ethics! My wife was very plain, never had my ruffs properly starched, and knew nothing about cookery. Why, there was a buck I had shot in Hogley Woods, a magnificent pricket, and do you know how she had it sent up to table? However, it is no matter now, for it is all over, and I don't think it was very nice of her brothers to starve me to death, though I did kill her.”

“Starve you to death? Oh, Mr. Ghost, I mean Sir Simon, are you hungry? I have a sandwich in my case. Would you like it?”

“No, thank you, I never eat anything now; but it is very kind of you, all the same, and you are much nicer than the rest of your horrid, rude, vulgar, dishonest family.”

“Stop!” cried Virginia, stamping her foot, “it is you who are rude, and horrid, and vulgar, and as for dishonesty, you know you stole the paints out of my box to try and furbish up that ridiculous blood-stain in the library. First you took all my reds, including the vermilion, and I couldn't do any more sunsets, then you took the emerald-green and the chrome-yellow, and finally I had nothing left but indigo and Chinese white, and could only do moonlight scenes, which are always depressing to look at, and not at all easy to paint. I never told on you, though I was very much annoyed, and it was most ridiculous, the whole thing; for who ever heard of emerald-green blood?”

“Well, really,” said the Ghost, rather meekly, “what was I to do? It is a very difficult thing to get real blood nowadays, and, as your brother began it all with his Paragon Detergent, I certainly saw no reason why I should not have your paints. As for colour, that is always a matter of taste: the Cantervilles have blue blood, for instance, the very bluest in England; but I know you Americans don't care for things of this kind.”

“You know nothing about it, and the best thing you can do is to emigrate and improve your mind. My father will be only too happy to give you a free passage, and though there is a heavy duty on spirits of every kind, there will be no difficulty about the Custom House, as the officers are all Democrats. Once in New York, you are sure to be a great success. I know lots of people there who would give a hundred thousand dollars to have a grandfather, and much more than that to have a family Ghost.”

“I don't think I should like America.”

“I suppose because we have no ruins and no curiosities,” said Virginia satirically.

“No ruins! no curiosities!” answered the Ghost, “you have your navy and your manners.”

“Good evening; I will go and ask papa to get the twins an extra week's holiday.”

“Please don't go, Miss Virginia,” he cried; “I am so lonely and so unhappy, and I really don't know what to do. I want to go to sleep and I cannot.”

“That's quite absurd! You have merely to go to bed and blow out the candle. It is very difficult sometimes to keep awake, especially at church, but there is no difficulty at all about sleeping. Why, even babies know how to do that, and they are not very clever.”

“I have not slept for three hundred years,” he said sadly, and Virginia's beautiful blue eyes opened in wonder; “for three hundred years I have not slept, and I am so tired.”

Virginia grew quite grave, and her little lips trembled like rose-leaves. She came towards him, and kneeling down at his side, looked up into his old withered face.

“Poor, poor Ghost,” she murmured, “have you no place where you can sleep?”

“Far away beyond the pine-woods,” he answered, in a low dreamy voice, “there is a little garden. There the grass grows long and deep, there are the great white stars of the hemlock flower, there the nightingale sings all night long. All night long he sings, and the cold, crystal moon looks down, and the yew-tree spreads out its giant arms over the sleepers.”

Virginia's eyes grew dim with tears, and she hid her face in her hands.

“You mean the Garden of Death,” she whispered.

“Yes, Death. Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no to-morrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace. You can help me. You can open for me the portals of Death's house, for Love is always with you, and Love is stronger than Death is.”

Virginia trembled, a cold shudder ran through her, and for a few moments there was silence. She felt as if she was in a terrible dream.

Then the Ghost spoke again, and his voice sounded like the sighing of the wind.

“Have you ever read the old prophecy on the library window?”

“Oh, often,” cried the little girl, looking up; “I know it quite well. It is painted in curious black letters, and it is difficult to read. There are only six lines:





When a golden girl can win

Prayer from out the lips of sin,

When the barren almond bears,

And a little child gives away its tears,

Then shall all the house be still

And peace come to Canterville.





But I don't know what they mean.”

“They mean,” he said sadly, “that you must weep for me for my sins, because I have no tears, and pray with me for my soul, because I have no faith, and then, if you have always been sweet, and good, and gentle, the Angel of Death will have mercy on me. You will see fearful shapes in darkness, and wicked voices will whisper in your ear, but they will not harm you, for against the purity of a little child the powers of Hell cannot prevail.”

Virginia made no answer, and the Ghost wrung his hands in wild despair as he looked down at her bowed golden head. Suddenly she stood up, very pale, and with a strange light in her eyes. “I am not afraid,” she said firmly, “and I will ask the Angel to have mercy on you.”

He rose from his seat with a faint cry of joy, and taking her hand bent over it with old-fashioned grace and kissed it. His fingers were as cold as ice, and his lips burned like fire, but Virginia did not falter, as he led her across the dusky room. On the faded green tapestry were broidered little huntsmen. They blew their tasselled horns and with their tiny hands waved to her to go back. “Go back! little Virginia,” they cried, “go back!” but the Ghost clutched her hand more tightly, and she shut her eyes against them. Horrible animals with lizard tails, and goggle eyes, blinked at her from the carven chimney-piece, and murmured “Beware! little Virginia, beware! we may never see you again,” but the Ghost glided on more swiftly, and Virginia did not listen. When they reached the end of the room he stopped, and muttered some words she could not understand. She opened her eyes, and saw the wall slowly fading away like a mist, and a great black cavern in front of her. A bitter cold wind swept round them, and she felt something pulling at her dress. “Quick, quick,” cried the Ghost, “or it will be too late,” and, in a moment, the wainscoting had closed behind them, and the Tapestry Chamber was empty.





Chapter 6


About ten minutes later, the bell rang for tea, and, as Virginia did not come down, Mrs. Otis sent up one of the footmen to tell her. After a little time he returned and said that he could not find Miss Virginia anywhere. As she was in the habit of going out to the garden every evening to get flowers for the dinner-table, Mrs. Otis was not at all alarmed at first, but when six o'clock struck, and Virginia did not appear, she became really agitated, and sent the boys out to look for her, while she herself and Mr. Otis searched every room in the house. At half-past six the boys came back and said that they could find no trace of their sister anywhere. They were all now in the greatest state of excitement, and did not know what to do, when Mr. Otis suddenly remembered that, some few days before, he had given a band of gipsies permission to camp in the park. He accordingly at once set off for Blackfell Hollow, where he knew they were, accompanied by his eldest son and two of the farm-servants. The little Duke of Cheshire, who was perfectly frantic with anxiety, begged hard to be allowed to go too, but Mr. Otis would not allow him, as he was afraid there might be a scuffle. On arriving at the spot, however, he found that the gipsies had gone, and it was evident that their departure had been rather sudden, as the fire was still burning, and some plates were lying on the grass. Having sent off Washington and the two men to scour the district, he ran home, and despatched telegrams to all the police inspectors in the county, telling them to look out for a little girl who had been kidnapped by tramps or gipsies. He then ordered his horse to be brought round, and, after insisting on his wife and the three boys sitting down to dinner, rode off down the Ascot Road with a groom. He had hardly, however, gone a couple of miles, when he heard somebody galloping after him, and, looking round, saw the little Duke coming up on his pony, with his face very flushed and no hat. “I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Otis,” gasped out the boy, “but I can't eat any dinner as long as Virginia is lost. Please, don't be angry with me; if you had let us be engaged last year, there would never have been all this trouble. You won't send me back, will you? I can't go! I won't go!”

The Minister could not help smiling at the handsome young scapegrace, and was a good deal touched at his devotion to Virginia, so leaning down from his horse, he patted him kindly on the shoulders, and said, “Well, Cecil, if you won't go back I suppose you must come with me, but I must get you a hat at Ascot.”

“Oh, bother my hat! I want Virginia!” cried the little Duke, laughing, and they galloped on to the railway station. There Mr. Otis inquired of the station-master if any one answering the description of Virginia had been seen on the platform, but could get no news of her. The station-master, however, wired up and down the line, and assured him that a strict watch would be kept for her, and, after having bought a hat for the little Duke from a linen-draper, who was just putting up his shutters, Mr. Otis rode off to Bexley, a village about four miles away, which he was told was a well-known haunt of the gipsies, as there was a large common next to it. Here they roused up the rural policeman, but could get no information from him, and, after riding all over the common, they turned their horses' heads homewards, and reached the Chase about eleven o'clock, dead-tired and almost heartbroken. They found Washington and the twins waiting for them at the gate-house with lanterns, as the avenue was very dark. Not the slightest trace of Virginia had been discovered. The gipsies had been caught on Brockley meadows, but she was not with them, and they had explained their sudden departure by saying that they had mistaken the date of Chorton Fair, and had gone off in a hurry for fear they might be late. Indeed, they had been quite distressed at hearing of Virginia's disappearance, as they were very grateful to Mr. Otis for having allowed them to camp in his park, and four of their number had stayed behind to help in the search. The carp-pond had been dragged, and the whole Chase thoroughly gone over, but without any result. It was evident that, for that night at any rate, Virginia was lost to them; and it was in a state of the deepest depression that Mr. Otis and the boys walked up to the house, the groom following behind with the two horses and the pony. In the hall they found a group of frightened servants, and lying on a sofa in the library was poor Mrs. Otis, almost out of her mind with terror and anxiety, and having her forehead bathed with eaude-cologne by the old housekeeper. Mr. Otis at once insisted on her having something to eat, and ordered up supper for the whole party. It was a melancholy meal, as hardly any one spoke, and even the twins were awestruck and subdued, as they were very fond of their sister. When they had finished, Mr. Otis, in spite of the entreaties of the little Duke, ordered them all to bed, saying that nothing more could be done that night, and that he would telegraph in the morning to Scotland Yard for some detectives to be sent down immediately. Just as they were passing out of the dining-room, midnight began to boom from the clock tower, and when the last stroke sounded they heard a crash and a sudden shrill cry; a dreadful peal of thunder shook the house, a strain of unearthly music floated through the air, a panel at the top of the staircase flew back with a loud noise, and out on the landing, looking very pale and white, with a little casket in her hand, stepped Virginia. In a moment they had all rushed up to her. Mrs. Otis clasped her passionately in her arms, the Duke smothered her with violent kisses, and the twins executed a wild war-dance round the group.

“Good heavens! child, where have you been?” said Mr. Otis, rather angrily, thinking that she had been playing some foolish trick on them. “Cecil and I have been riding all over the country looking for you, and your mother has been frightened to death. You must never play these practical jokes any more.”

“Except on the Ghost! except on the Ghost!” shrieked the twins, as they capered about.

“My own darling, thank God you are found; you must never leave my side again,” murmured Mrs. Otis, as she kissed the trembling child, and smoothed the tangled gold of her hair.

“Papa,” said Virginia quietly, “I have been with the Ghost. He is dead, and you must come and see him. He had been very wicked, but he was really sorry for all that he had done, and he gave me this box of beautiful jewels before he died.”

The whole family gazed at her in mute amazement, but she was quite grave and serious; and, turning round, she led them through the opening in the wainscoting down a narrow secret corridor, Washington following with a lighted candle, which he had caught up from the table. Finally, they came to a great oak door, studded with rusty nails. When Virginia touched it, it swung back on its heavy hinges, and they found themselves in a little low room, with a vaulted ceiling, and one tiny grated window. Embedded in the wall was a huge iron ring, and chained to it was a gaunt skeleton, that was stretched out at full length on the stone floor, and seemed to be trying to grasp with its long fleshless fingers an old-fashioned trencher and ewer, that were placed just out of its reach. The jug had evidently been once filled with water, as it was covered inside with green mould. There was nothing on the trencher but a pile of dust. Virginia knelt down beside the skeleton, and, folding her little hands together, began to pray silently, while the rest of the party looked on in wonder at the terrible tragedy whose secret was now disclosed to them.

“Hallo!” suddenly exclaimed one of the twins, who had been looking out of the window to try and discover in what wing of the house the room was situated. “Hallo! the old withered almond-tree has blossomed. I can see the flowers quite plainly in the moonlight.”

“God has forgiven him,” said Virginia gravely, as she rose to her feet, and a beautiful light seemed to illumine her face.

“What an angel you are!” cried the young Duke, and he put his arm round her neck, and kissed her.





Chapter 7


Four days after these curious incidents a funeral started from Canterville Chase at about eleven o'clock at night. The hearse was drawn by eight black horses, each of which carried on its head a great tuft of nodding ostrich-plumes, and the leaden coffin was covered by a rich purple pall, on which was embroidered in gold the Canterville coat-of-arms. By the side of the hearse and the coaches walked the servants with lighted torches, and the whole procession was wonderfully impressive. Lord Canterville was the chief mourner, having come up specially from Wales to attend the funeral, and sat in the first carriage along with little Virginia. Then came the United States Minister and his wife, then Washington and the three boys, and in the last carriage was Mrs. Umney. It was generally felt that, as she had been frightened by the ghost for more than fifty years of her life, she had a right to see the last of him. A deep grave had been dug in the corner of the churchyard, just under the old yewtree, and the service was read in the most impressive manner by the Rev. Augustus Dampier. When the ceremony was over the servants according to an old custom observed in the Canterville family, extinguished their torches, and, as the coffin was being lowered into the grave, Virginia stepped forward, and laid on it a large cross made of white and pink almond-blossoms. As she did so, the moon came out from behind a cloud, and flooded with its silent silver the little churchyard, and from a distant copse a nightingale began to sing. She thought of the ghost's description of the Garden of Death, her eyes became dim with tears, and she hardly spoke a word during the drive home.

The next morning, before Lord Canterville went up to town, Mr. Otis had an interview with him on the subject of the jewels the ghost had given to Virginia. They were perfectly magnificent, especially a certain ruby necklace with old Venetian setting, which was really a superb specimen of sixteenth-century work, and their value was so great that Mr. Otis felt considerable scruples about allowing his daughter to accept them.

“My Lord,” he said, “I know that in this country mortmain is held to apply to trinkets as well as to land, and it is quite clear to me that these jewels are, or should be, heirlooms in your family. I must beg you, accordingly, to take them to London with you, and to regard them simply as a portion of your property which has been restored to you under certain strange conditions. As for my daughter, she is merely a child, and has as yet, I am glad to say, but little interest in such appurtenances of idle luxury. I am also informed by Mrs. Otis, who, I may say, is no mean authority upon Art——having had the privilege of spending several winters in Boston when she was a girl——that these gems are of great monetary worth, and if offered for sale would fetch a tall price. Under these circumstances, Lord Canterville, I feel sure that you will recognise how impossible it would be for me to allow them to remain in the possession of any member of my family; and, indeed, all such vain gauds and toys, however suitable or necessary to the dignity of the British aristocracy, would be completely out of place among those who have been brought up on the severe, and I believe immortal, principles of republican simplicity. Perhaps I should mention that Virginia is very anxious that you should allow her to retain the box, as a memento of your unfortunate but misguided ancestor. As it is extremely old, and consequently a good deal out of repair, you may perhaps think fit to comply with her request. For my own part, I confess I am a good deal surprised to find a child of mine expressing sympathy with mediaevalism in any form, and can only account for it by the fact that Virginia was born in one of your London suburbs shortly after Mrs. Otis had returned from a trip to Athens.”

Lord Canterville listened very gravely to the worthy Minister's speech, pulling his grey moustache now and then to hide an involuntary smile, and when Mr. Otis had ended, he shook him cordially by the hand, and said, “My dear sir, your charming little daughter rendered my unlucky ancestor, Sir Simon, a very important service, and I and my family are much indebted to her for her marvellous courage and pluck. The jewels are clearly hers, and, egad, I believe that if I were heartless enough to take them from her, the wicked old fellow would be out of his grave in a fortnight, leading me the devil of a life. As for their being heirlooms, nothing is an heirloom that is not so mentioned in a will or legal document, and the existence of these jewels has been quite unknown. I assure you I have no more claim on them than your butler, and when Miss Virginia grows up I daresay she will be pleased to have pretty things to wear. Besides, you forget, Mr. Otis, that you took the furniture and the ghost at a valuation, and anything that belonged to the ghost passed at once into your possession, as, whatever activity Sir Simon may have shown in the corridor at night, in point of law he was really dead, and you acquired his property by purchase.”

Mr. Otis was a good deal distressed at Lord Canterville's refusal, and begged him to reconsider his decision, but the good-natured peer was quite firm, and finally induced the Minister to allow his daughter to retain the present the ghost had given her, and when, in the spring of 1890, the young Duchess of Cheshire was presented at the Queen's first drawing-room on the occasion of her marriage, her jewels were the universal the me of admiration. For Virginia received the coronet, which is the reward of all good little American girls, and was married to her boy-lover as soon as he came of age. They were both so charming, and they loved each other so much, that every one was delighted at the match, except the old Marchioness of Dumbleton, who had tried to catch the Duke for one of her seven unmarried daughters, and had given no less than three expensive dinner-parties for that purpose, and, strange to say, Mr. Otis himself. Mr. Otis was extremely fond of the young Duke personally, but, theoretically, he objected to titles, and, to use his own words, “was not without apprehension lest, amid the enervating influences of a pleasure-loving aristocracy, the true principles of republican simplicity should be forgotten.” His objections, however, were completely overruled, and I believe that when he walked up the aisle of St. George's, Hanover Square, with his daughter leaning on his arm, there was not a prouder man in the whole length and breadth of England.

The Duke and Duchess, after the honeymoon was over, went down to Canterville Chase, and on the day after their arrival they walked over in the afternoon to the lonely churchyard by the pinewoods. There had been a great deal of difficulty at first about the inscription on Sir Simon's tombstone, but finally it had been decided to engrave on it simply the initials of the old gentleman's name, and the verse from the library window. The Duchess had brought with her some lovely roses, which she strewed upon the grave, and after they had stood by it for some time they strolled into the ruined chancel of the old abbey. There the Duchess sat down on a fallen pillar, while her husband lay at her feet smoking a cigarette and looking up at her beautiful eyes. Suddenly he threw his cigarette away, took hold of her hand, and said to her, “Virginia, a wife should have no secrets from her husband.”

“Dear Cecil! I have no secrets from you.”

“Yes, you have,” he answered, smiling, “you have never told me what happened to you when you were locked up with the ghost.”

“I have never told any one, Cecil,” said Virginia gravely.

“I know that, but you might tell me.”

“Please don't ask me, Cecil, I cannot tell you. Poor Sir Simon! I owe him a great deal. Yes, don't laugh, Cecil, I really do. He made me see what Life is, and what Death signifies, and why Love is stronger than both.”

The Duke rose and kissed his wife lovingly.

“You can have your secret as long as I have your heart,” he murmured.

“You have always had that, Cecil.”

“And you will tell our children some day, won't you?”

Virginia blushed.

THE PORTRAIT OF MR. W.H.


Chapter 1


I had been dining with Erskine in his pretty little house in Birdcage Walk, and we were sitting in the library over our coffee and cigarettes, when the question of literary forgeries happened to turn up in conversation. I cannot at present remember how it was that we struck upon this somewhat curious topic, as it was at that time, but I know we had a long discussion about Macpherson, Ireland, and Chatterton, and that with regard to the last I insisted that his so-called forgeries were merely the result of an artistic desire for perfect representation; that we had no right to quarrel with an artist for the conditions under which he chooses to present his work; and that all Art being to a certain degree a mode of acting, an attempt to realise one's own personality on some imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents and limitations of real life, to censure an artist for a forgery was to confuse an ethical with an aesthetical problem.

Erskine, who was a good deal older than I was, and had been listening to me with the amused deference of a man of forty, suddenly put his hand upon my shoulder and said to me, “What would you say about a young man who had a strange theory about a certain work of art, believed in his theory, and committed a forgery in order to prove it?”

“Ah! that is quite a different matter,” I answered.

Erskine remained silent for a few moments, looking at the thin grey threads of smoke that were rising from his cigarette. “Yes,” he said, after a pause, “quite different.”

There was something in the tone of his voice, a slight touch of bitterness perhaps, that excited my curiosity. “Did you ever know anybody who did that?” I cried.

“Yes,” he answered, throwing his cigarette into the fire——“a great friend of mine, Cyril Graham. He was very fascinating, and very foolish, and very heartless. However, he left me the only legacy I ever received in my life.”

“What was that?” I exclaimed. Erskine rose from his seat, and going over to a tall inlaid cabinet that stood between the two windows, unlocked it, and came back to where I was sitting, holding in his hand a small panel picture set in an old and somewhat tarnished Elizabethan frame.

It was a full-length portrait of a young man in late sixteenth-century costume, standing by a table, with his right hand resting on an open book. He seemed about seventeen years of age, and was of quite extraordinary personal beauty, though evidently somewhat effeminate. Indeed, had it not been for the dress and the closely cropped hair, one would have said that the face, with its dreamy wistful eyes and its delicate scarlet lips, was the face of a girl. In manner, and especially in the treatment of the hands, the picture reminded one of François Clouet's later work. The black velvet doublet with its fantastically gilded points, and the peacock-blue background against which it showed up so pleasantly, and from which it gained such luminous value of colour, were quite in Clouet's style; and the two masks of Tragedy and Comedy that hung somewhat formally from the marble pedestal had that hard severity of touch——so different from the facile grace of the Italians——which even at the Court of France the great Flemish master never completely lost, and which in itself has always been a characteristic of the northern temper.

“It is a charming thing,” I cried, “but who is this wonderful young man whose beauty Art has so happily preserved for us?”

“This is the portrait of Mr. W.H.,” said Erskine, with a sad smile. It might have been a chance effect of light, but it seemed to me that his eyes were quite bright with tears.

“Mr. W.H.!” I exclaimed; “who was Mr. W.H.?”

“Don't you remember?” he answered; “look at the book on which his hand is resting.”

“I see there is some writing there, but I cannot make it out,” I replied.

“Take this magnifying-glass and try,” said Erskine, with the same sad smile still playing about his mouth.

I took the glass, and moving the lamp a little nearer, I began to spell out the crabbed sixteenth-century handwriting. “To the Onlie Begetter of These Insuing Sonnets.” … “Good heavens!” I cried, “Is this Shakespeare's Mr. W.H.?”

“Cyril Graham used to say so,” muttered Erskine.

“But it is not a bit like Lord Pembroke,” I answered. “I know the Penshurst portraits very well. I was staying near there a few weeks ago.”

“Do you really believe then that the sonnets are addressed to Lord Pembroke?” he asked.

“I am sure of it,” I answered. “Pembroke, Shakespeare, and Mrs. Mary Fitton are the three personages of the Sonnets; there is no doubt at all about it.”

“Well, I agree with you,” said Erskine, “but I did not always think so. I used to believe——well, I suppose I used to believe in Cyril Graham and his theory.”

“And what was that?” I asked, looking at the wonderful portrait, which had already begun to have a strange fascination for me.

“It is a long story,” said Erskine, taking the picture away from me——rather abruptly I thought at the time——“a very long story; but if you care to hear it, I will tell it to you.”

“I love theories about the Sonnets,” I cried; “but I don't think I am likely to be converted to any new idea. The matter has ceased to be a mystery to any one. Indeed, I wonder that it ever was a mystery.”

“As I don't believe in the theory, I am not likely to convert you to it,” said Erskine, laughing; “but it may interest you.”

“Tell it to me, of course,” I answered. “If it is half as delightful as the picture, I shall be more than satisfied.”

“Well,” said Erskine, lighting a cigarette, “I must begin by telling you about Cyril Graham himself. He and I were at the same house at Eton. I was a year or two older than he was, but we were immense friends, and did all our work and all our play together. There was, of course, a good deal more play than work, but I cannot say that I am sorry for that. It is always an advantage not to have received a sound commercial education, and what I learned in the playing fields at Eton has been quite as useful to me as anything I was taught at Cambridge. I should tell you that Cyril's father and mother were both dead. They had been drowned in a horrible yachting accident off the Isle of Wight. His father had been in the diplomatic service, and had married a daughter, the only daughter, in fact, of old Lord Crediton, who became Cyril's guardian after the death of his parents. I don't think that Lord Crediton cared very much for Cyril. He had never really forgiven his daughter for marrying a man who had no title. He was an extraordinary old aristocrat, who swore like a costermonger, and had the manners of a farmer. I remember seeing him once on Speech-day. He growled at me, gave me a sovereign, and told me not to grow up ‘a damned Radical’ like my father. Cyril had very little affection for him, and was only too glad to spend most of his holidays with us in Scotland. They never really got on together at all. Cyril thought him a bear, and he thought Cyril effeminate. He was effeminate, I suppose, in some things, though he was a very good rider and a capital fencer. In fact he got the foils before he left Eton. But he was very languid in his manner, and not a little vain of his good looks, and had a strong objection to football, The two things that really gave him pleasure were poetry and acting. At Eton he was always dressing up and reciting Shakespeare, and when we went up to Trinity he became a member of the A.D.C. his first term. I remember I was always very jealous of his acting. I was absurdly devoted to him; I suppose because we were so different in some things. I was a rather awkward, weakly lad, with huge feet, and horribly freckled. Freckles run in Scotch families just as gout does in English families. Cyril used to say that of the two he preferred the gout; but he always set an absurdly high value on personal appearance, and once read a paper before our Debating Society to prove that it was better to be good-looking than to be good. He certainly was wonderfully handsome. People who did not like him, Philistines and college tutors, and young men reading for the Church, used to say that he was merely pretty; but there was a great deal more in his face than mere prettiness. I think he was the most splendid creature I ever saw, and nothing could exceed the grace of his movements, the charm of his manner. He fascinated everybody who was worth fascinating, and a great many people who were not. He was often wilful and petulant, and I used to think him dreadfully insincere. It was due, I think, chiefly to his inordinate desire to please. Poor Cyril! I told him once that he was contented with very cheap triumphs, but he only laughed. He was horribly spoiled. All charming people, I fancy, are spoiled. It is the secret of their attraction.

“However, I must tell you about Cyril's acting. You know that no actresses are allowed to play at the A.D.C. At least they were not in my time. I don't know how it is now. Well, of course, Cyril was always cast for the girls'parts, and when As You Like It was produced he played Rosalind. It was a marvellous performance. In fact, Cyril Graham was the only perfect Rosalind I have ever seen. It would be impossible to describe to you the beauty, the delicacy, the refinement of the whole thing. It made an immense sensation, and the horrid little theatre as it was then, was crowded every night. Even now when I read the play I can't help thinking of Cyril. It might have been written for him. The next term he took his degree, and came to London to read for the diplomatic. But he never did any work. He spent his days in reading Shakespeare's Sonnets, and his evenings at the theatre. He was, of course, wild to go on the stage. It was all that Lord Crediton and I could do to prevent him. Perhaps if he had gone on the stage he would be alive now. It is always a silly thing to give advice, but to give good advice is absolutely fatal. I hope you will never fall into that error. If you do, you will be sorry for it.

“Well, to come to the real point of the story, one day I got a letter from Cyril asking me to come round to his rooms that evening. He had charming chambers in Piccadilly overlooking the Green Park, and as I used to go to see him every day, I was rather surprised at his taking the trouble to write. Of course I went, and when I arrived I found him in a state of great excitement. He told me that he had at last discovered the true secret of Shakespeare's Sonnets; that all the scholars and critics had been entirely on the wrong track; and that he was the first who, working purely by internal evidence, had found out who Mr. W.H. really was. He was perfectly wild with delight, and for a long time would not tell me his theory. Finally, he produced a bundle of notes, took his copy of the Sonnets off the mantelpiece, and sat down and gave me a long lecture on the whole subject.

“He began by pointing out that the young man to whom Shakespeare addressed these strangely passionate poems must have been somebody who was a really vital factor in the development of his dramatic art, and that this could not be said of either Lord Pembroke or Lord Southampton. Indeed, whoever he was, he could not have been anybody of high birth, as was shown very clearly by Sonnet XXV, in which Shakespeare contrasts himself with men who are ‘great princes' favourites,’ says quite frankly:





Let those who are in favour with their stars

Of public honour and proud titles boast,

Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,

Unlooked for joy in that I honour most;





and ends the sonnet by congratulating himself on the mean state of him he so adored:





Then happy I, that love and am beloved

Where I may not remove nor be removed





This sonnet Cyril declared would be quite unintelligible if we fancied that it was addressed to either the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Southampton, both of whom were men of the highest position in England and fully entitled to be called ‘great princes’; and he in corroboration of his view read me Sonnets CXXIV and CXXV, in which Shakespeare tells us that his love is not ‘the child of state,’ that it ‘suffers not in smiling pomp,’ but is ‘builded far from accident.’ I listened with a good deal of interest, for I don't think the point had ever been made before; but what followed was still more curious, and seemed to me at the time to dispose entirely of Pembroke's claim. We know from Meres that the Sonnets had been written before 1598, and Sonnet CIV informs us that Shakespeare's friendship for Mr. W.H. had been already in existence for three years. Now Lord Pembroke, who was born in 1580, did not come to London till he was eighteen years of age, that is to say till 1598, and Shakespeare's acquaintance with Mr. W.H. must have begun in 1594, or at the latest in 1595. Shakespeare, accordingly, could not have known Lord Pembroke until after the Sonnets had been written.

“Cyril pointed out also that Pembroke's father did not die until 1601; whereas it was evident from the line,





You had a father, let your son say so,





that the father of Mr. W.H. was dead in 1598. Besides, it was absurd to imagine that any publisher of the time, and the preface is from the publisher's hand, would have ventured to address William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, as Mr. W.H.; the case of Lord Buckhurst being spoken of as Mr. Sackville being not really a parallel instance, as Lord Buckhurst was not a peer, but merely the younger son of a peer, with a courtesy title, and the passage in England's Parnassus, where he is so spoken of, is not a formal and stately dedication, but simply a casual allusion. So far for Lord Pembroke, whose supposed claims Cyril easily demolished while I sat by in wonder. With Lord Southampton Cyril had even less difficulty. Southampton became at a very early age the lover of Elizabeth Vernon, so he needed no entreaties to marry; he was not beautiful; he did not resemble his mother, as Mr. W.H. did:





Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee

Calls back the lovely April of her prime;





and, above all, his Christian name was Henry, whereas the punning sonnets (CXXXV and CXLIII) show that the Christian name of Shakespeare's friend was the same as his own——Will.

“As for the other suggestions of unfortunate commentators, that Mr. W.H. is a misprint for Mr. W.S., meaning Mr. William Shakespeare; that ‘Mr. W.H. all’ should read ‘Mr. W. Hall’; that Mr. W.H. is Mr. William Hathaway; and that a full stop should be placed after ‘wisheth,’ making Mr. W.H. the writer and not the subject of the dedication,——Cyril got rid of them in a very short time; and it is not worth while to mention his reasons, though I remember he sent me off into a fit of laughter by reading to me, I am glad to say not in the original, some extracts from a German commentator called Barnstorff, who insisted that Mr. W.H. was no less a person than‘Mr. William Himself.’ Nor would he allow for a moment that the Sonnets are mere satires on the work of Drayton and John Davies of Hereford. To him, as indeed to me, they were poems of serious and tragic import, wrung out of the bitterness of Shakespeare's heart, and made sweet by the honey of his lips. Still less would he admit that they were merely a philosophical allegory, and that in them Shakespeare is addressing his Ideal Self, or Ideal Manhood, or the Spirit of Beauty, or the Reason, or the Divine Logos, or the Catholic Church. He felt, as indeed I think we all must feel, that the Sonnets are addressed to an individual, ——to a particular young man whose personality for some reason seems to have filled the soul of Shakespeare with terrible joy and no less terrible despair.

“Having in this manner cleared the way, as it were, Cyril asked me to dismiss from my mind any preconceived ideas I might have formed on the subject, and to give a fair and unbiassed hearing to his own theory. The problem he pointed out was this: Who was that young man of Shakespeare's day who, without being of noble birth or even of noble nature, was addressed by him in terms of such passionate adoration that we can but wonder at the strange worship, and are almost afraid to turn the key that unlocks the mystery of the poet's heart? Who was he whose physical beauty was such that it became the very corner-stone of Shakespeare's art; the very source of Shakespeare's inspiration; the very incarnation of Shakespeare's dreams? To look upon him as simply the object of certain love-poems is to miss the whole meaning of the poems: for the art of which Shakespeare talks in the Sonnets is not the art of the Sonnets themselves, which indeed were to him but slight and secret things——it is the art of the dramatist to which he is always alluding; and he to whom Shakespeare said:





Thou art all my art, and dost advance

As high as learning my rude ignorance,





he to whom he promised immortality,





Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men,





was surely none other than the boy-actor for whom he created Viola and Imogen, Juliet and Rosalind, Portia and Desdemona, and Cleopatra herself. This was Cyril Graham's theory, evolved as you see purely from the Sonnets themselves, and depending for its acceptance not so much on demonstrable proof or formal evidence, but on a kind of spiritual and artistic sense, by which alone he claimed could the true meaning of the poems be discerned. I remember his reading to me that fine sonnet——





How can my Muse want subject to invent,

While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse

Thine own sweet argument, too excellent

For every vulgar paper to rehearse

O give thyself the thanks, if aught in me

Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;

For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,

When thou thyself dost give invention light?

Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth

Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;

And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth

Eternal numbers to outlive long date…





and pointing out how completely it corroborated his theory; and indeed he went through all the Sonnets carefully, and showed, or fancied that he showed, that, according to his new explanation of their meaning, things that had seemed obscure, or evil, or exaggerated, became clear and rational, and of high artistic import, illustrating Shakespeare's conception of the true relations between the art of the actor and the art of the dramatist.

“It is of course evident that there must have been in Shakespeare's company some wonderful boy-actor of great beauty, to whom he intrusted the presentation of his noble heroines, for Shakespeare was a practical theatrical manager as well as an imaginative poet, and Cyril Graham had actually discovered the boy-actor's name. He was Will, or, as he preferred to call him, Willie Hughes. The Christian name he found of course in the punning sonnets, CXXXV and CXLIII; the surname was, according to him, hidden in the seventh line of Sonnet XX, where Mr. W.H. is described as:





A man in hew, all Hews in his controwling.





“In the original edition of the Sonnets ‘Hews’ is printed with a capital letter and in italics, and this, he claimed, showed clearly that a play on words was intended, his view receiving a good deal of corroboration from those sonnets in which curious puns are made on the words ‘use’ and ‘usury.’ Of course I was converted at once, and Willie Hughes became to me as real a person as Shakespeare. The only objection I made to the theory was that the name of Willie Hughes does not occur in the list of the actors of Shakespeare's company as it is printed in the first folio. Cyril, however, pointed out that the absence of Willie Hughes' name from this list really corroborated the theory, as it was evident from Sonnet LXXXVI, that he had abandoned Shakespeare's company to play at a rival theatre, probably in some of Chapman's plays. It was in reference to this that in the great sonnet on Chapman Shakespeare said to Willie Hughes:





But when your countenance filled up his line,

Then lacked I matter; that enfeebled mine…





the expression ‘when your countenance filled up his line’ referring obviously to the beauty of the young actor giving life and reality and added charm to Chapman's verse, the same idea being also put forward in Sonnet LXXIX:





Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,

My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,

But now my gracious numbers are decayed,

And my sick Muse doth give another place;





and in the immediately preceding sonnet, where Shakespeare says,





Every alien pen hath got my use

And under thee their poesy disperse,





the play upon words (use=Hughes) being of course obvious, and the phrase ‘under thee their poesy disperse,’ meaning ‘by your assistance as an actor bring their plays before the people.’

“It was a wonderful evening, and we sat up almost till dawn reading and re-reading the Sonnets. After some time, however, I began to see that before the theory could be placed before the world in a really perfected form, it was necessary to get some independent evidence about the existence of this young actor, Willie Hughes. If this could be once established, there could be no possible doubt about his identity with Mr. W.H.; but otherwise the theory would fall to the ground. I put this forward very strongly to Cyril, who was a good deal annoyed at what he called my Philistine tone of mind, and indeed was rather bitter upon the subject. However, I made him promise that in his own interest he would not publish his discovery till he had put the whole matter beyond the reach of doubt; and for weeks and weeks we searched the registers of City churches, the Alleyn manuscript at Dulwich, the Record Office, the papers of the Lord Chamberlain——everything, in fact, that we thought might contain some allusion to Willie Hughes. We discovered nothing, of course, and every day the existence of Willie Hughes seemed to me to become more problematical. Cyril was in a dreadful state, and used to go over the whole question day after day, entreating me to believe; but I saw the one flaw in the theory, and I refused to be convinced till the actual existence of Willie Hughes, a boy-actor of the Elizabethan days, had been placed beyond the reach of doubt or cavil.

“One day Cyril left town to stay with his grandfather, I thought at the time, but I afterwards heard from Lord Crediton that this was not the case; and about a fortnight afterwards I received a telegram from him, handed in at Warwick, asking me to be sure to come and dine with him that evening at eight o'clock. When I arrived, he said to me, ‘The only apostle who did not deserve proof was St. Thomas, and St. Thomas was the only apostle who got it.’ I asked him what he meant. He answered that he had been able not merely to establish the existence in the sixteenth century of a boy-actor of the name of Willie Hughes, but to prove by the most conclusive evidence that he was the Mr. W.H. of the Sonnets. He would not tell me anything more at the time; but after dinner he solemnly produced the picture I showed you, and told me that he had discovered it by the merest chance nailed to the side of an old chest that he had bought at a farmhouse in Warwickshire. The chest itself, which was a very fine example of Elizabethan work, he had, of course, brought with him, and in the centre of the front panel the initials W.H. were undoubtedly carved. It was this monogram that had attracted his attention, and he told me that it was not till he had had the chest in his possession for several days that he had thought of making any careful examination of the inside. One morning, however, he saw that one of the side of the chest was much thicker than the other, and looking more closely, he discovered that a framed panel picture was clamped against it. On taking it out, he found it was the picture that is now lying on the sofa. It was very dirty, and covered with mould; but he managed to clean it, and, to his great joy, saw that he had fallen by mere chance on the one thing for which he had been looking. Here was an authentic portrait of Mr. W.H. with his hand resting on the dedicatory page of the Sonnets, and on the frame itself could be faintly seen the name of the young man written in black uncial letters on a faded gold ground, ‘Master Will. Hews’.

“Well, what was I to say? It never occurred to me for a moment that Cyril Graham was playing a trick on me, or that he was trying to prove his theory by means of a forgery.”

“But is it a forgery?” I asked.

“Of course it is,” said Erskine. “It is a very good forgery; but it is a forgery none the less. I thought at the time that Cyril was rather calm about the whole matter; but I remember he more than once told me that he himself required no proof of the kind, and that he thought the theory complete without it. I laughed at him, and told him that without it the theory would fall to the ground, and I warmly congratulated him on the marvellous discovery. We then arranged that the picture should be etched or facsimiled, and placed as the frontispiece to Cyril's edition of the Sonnets; and for three months we did nothing but go over each poem line by line, till we had settled every difficulty of text or meaning. One unlucky day I was in a print-shop in Holborn, when I saw upon the counter some extremely beautiful drawings in silver-point. I was so attracted by them that I bought them; and the proprietor of the place, a man called Rawlings, told me that they were done by a young painter of the name of Edward Merton, who was very clever, but as poor as a church mouse. I went to see Merton some days afterwards, having got his address from the print-seller, and found a pale, interesting young man, with a rather common-looking wife,——his model, as I subsequently learned. I told him how much I admired his drawings, at which he seemed very pleased, and I asked him if he would show me some of his other work. As we were looking over a portfolio, full of really very lovely things,——for Merton had a most delicate and delightful touch,——I suddenly caught sight of a drawing of the picture of Mr. W.H. There was no doubt whatever about it. It was almost a facsimile,——the only difference being that the two masks of Tragedy and Comedy were not suspended from the marble table as they are in the picture but were lying on the floor at the young man's feet. ‘Where on earth did you get that?’ I said. He grew rather confused, and said,——‘Oh, that is nothing. I did not know it was in this portfolio. It is not a thing of any value.’ ‘It is what you did for Mr. Cyril Graham,’ exclaimed his wife; ‘and if this gentleman wishes to buy it, let him have it.’ ‘For Mr. Cyril Graham?’ I repeated. ‘Did you paint the picture of Mr. W.H.?’ ‘I don't understand what you mean,’ he answered, growing very red. Well, the whole thing was quite dreadful. The wife let it all out. I gave her five pounds when I was going away. I can't bear to think of it, now; but of course I was furious. I went off at once to Cyril's chambers, waited there for three hours before he came in, with that horrid lie staring me in the face, and told him I had discovered his forgery. He grew very pale and said,——‘I did it purely for your sake. You would not be convinced in any other way. It does not affect the truth of the theory.’ ‘The truth of the theory!’ I exclaimed; ‘the less we talk about that the better. You never even believed in it yourself. If you had, you would not have committed a forgery to prove it.’ High words passed between us; we had a fearful quarrel. I dare say I was unjust and the next morning he was dead.”

“Dead!” I cried.

“Yes; he shot himself with a revolver. Some of the blood splashed upon the frame of the picture, just where the name had been painted. By the time I arrived,——his servant had sent for me at once,——the police were already there. He had left a letter for me, evidently written in the greatest agitation and distress of mind.”

“What was in it?” I asked.

“Oh, that he believed absolutely in Willie Hughes; that the forgery of the picture had been done simply as a concession to me, and did not in the slightest degree invalidate the truth of the theory; and that in order to show me how firm and flawless his faith in the whole thing was, he was going to offer his life as a sacrifice to the secret of the Sonnets. It was a foolish, mad letter. I remember he ended by saying that he intrusted to me the Willie Hughes theory, and that it was for me to present it to the world, and to unlock the secret of Shakespeare's heart.”

“It is a most tragic story,” I cried, “but why have you not carried out his wishes?”

Erskine shrugged his shoulders. “Because it is a perfectly unsound theory from beginning to end,” he answered.

“My dear Erskine,” I said, getting up from my seat, “you are entirely wrong about the whole matter. It is the only perfect key to Shakespeare's Sonnets that has ever been made. It is complete in every detail. I believe in Willie Hughes.”

“Don't say that,” said Erskine gravely; “I believe there is something fatal about the idea, and intellectually there is nothing to be said for it. I have gone into the whole matter, and I assure you the theory is entirely fallacious. It is plausible up to a certain point. Then it stops. For heaven's sake, my dear boy, don't take up the subject of Willie Hughes. You will break your heart over it.”

“Erskine,” I answered, “it is your duty to give this theory to the world. If you will not do it, I will. By keeping it back you wrong the memory of Cyril Graham, the youngest and the most splendid of all the martyrs of literature. I entreat you to do him justice. He died for this thing,——don't let his death be in vain.”

Erskine looked at me in amazement. “You are carried away by the sentiment of the whole story,” he said. “You forget that a thing is not necessarily true because a man dies for it. I was devoted to Cyril Graham. His death was a horrible blow to me. I did not recover from it for years. I don't think I have ever recovered from it. But Willie Hughes! There is nothing in the idea of Willie Hughes. No such person ever existed. As for bringing the whole thing before the world,——the world thinks that Cyril Graham shot himself by accident. The only proof of his suicide was contained in the letter to me, and of this letter the public never heard anything. To the present day Lord Crediton thinks that the whole thing was accidental.”

“Cyril Graham sacrificed his life to a great Idea,” I answered; “and if you will not tell of his martyrdom, tell at least of his faith.”

“His faith,” said Erskine, “was fixed in a thing that was false, in a thing that was unsound, in a thing that no Shakespearean scholar would accept for a moment. The theory would be laughed at. Don't make a fool of yourself, and don't follow a trail that leads nowhere. You start by assuming the existence of the very person whose existence is the thing to be proved. Besides, everybody knows that the Sonnets were addressed to Lord Pembroke. The matter is settled once for all.”

“The matter is not settled,” I exclaimed. “I will take up the theory where Cyril Graham left it, and I will prove to the world that he was right.”

“Silly boy!” said Erskine. “Go home, it is after two, and don't think about Willie Hughes any more. I am sorry I told you anything about it, and very sorry indeed that I should have converted you to a thing in which I don't believe.”

“You have given me the key to the greatest mystery of modern literature,” I answered; “and I shall not rest till I have made you recognise, till I have made everybody recognise, that Cyril Graham was the most subtle Shakespearean critic of our day.”

As I walked home through St. James's Park the dawn was just breaking over London. The white swans were lying asleep on the polished lake, and the gaunt Palace looked purple against the pale green sky. I thought of Cyril Graham, and my eyes filled with tears.





Chapter 2


It was past twelve when I awoke, and the sun was streaming in through the curtains of my room in long slanting beams of dusty gold. I told my servant that I would not be at home to anyone, and after I had had a cup of chocolate and a petit-pain, I took down from the book-shelf my copy of Shakespeare's Sonnets, and began to go carefully through them. Each poem seemed to me to corroborate Cyril Graham's theory. I felt as if I had my hand upon Shakespeare's heart, and was counting each separate throb and pulse of passion. I thought of the wonderful boy-actor, and saw his face in every line.

Two sonnets, I remember, struck me particularly: they were the 53rd and the 67th. In the first of these, Shakespeare, complimenting Willie Hughes on the versatility of his acting, on his wide range of parts, a range extending from Rosalind to Juliet, from Beatrice to Ophelia, says to him:





What is your substance, where of are you made,

That millions of strange shadows on you tend?

Since every one hath, every one, one shade,

And you, but one, can every shadow lend…





lines that would be unintelligible if they were not addressed to an actor, for the word “shadow” had in Shakespeare's day a technical meaning connected with the stage. “The best in this kind are but shadows,” says Theseus of the actors in the Midsummer Night's Dream, and there are many similar allusions in the literature of the day. These sonnets evidently belonged to the series in which Shakespeare discusses the nature of the actor's art, and of the strange and rare temperament that is essential to the perfect stage-player. “How is it,” says Shakespeare to Willie Hughes, “that you have so many personalities?” and then he goes on to point out that his beauty is such that it seems to realise every form and phase of fancy, to embody each dream of the creative imagination,——an idea that is still further expanded in the sonnet that immediately follows, where, beginning with the fine thought,





O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem

By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!





Shakespeare invites us to notice how the truth of acting, the truth of visible presentation on the stage, adds to the wonder of poetry, giving life to its loveliness, and actual reality to its ideal form. And yet, in Sonnet LXVII, Shakespeare calls upon Willie Hughes to abandon the stage with its artificiality, its unreal life of painted face and mimic costume, its immoral influences and suggestions, its remoteness from the true world of noble action and sincere utterance.





Ah, wherefore with infection should he live,

And with his presence grace impiety,

That sin by him advantage should achieve,

And lace itself with his society?

Why should false painting imitate his cheek,

And steal dead seeing of his living hue?

Why should poor beauty indirectly seek

Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?





It may seem strange that so great a dramatist as Shakespeare, who realised his own perfection as an artist and his humanity as a man on the ideal plane of stage-writing and stage-playing, should have written in these terms about the theatre; but we must remember that in Sonnets CX and CXI, Shakespeare shows us that he too was wearied of the world of puppets, and full of shame at having made himself “a motley to the view.” Sonnet CXI is especially bitter:





O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,

The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,

That did not better for my life provide

Than public means which public manners breeds.

Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,

And almost thence my nature is subdued

To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:

Pity me, then, and wish I were renewed…





and there are many signse of the same feeling elsewhere, signs familiar to all real students of Shakespeare.

One point puzzled me immensely as I read the Sonnets, and it was days before I struck on the true interpretation, which indeed Cyril Graham himself seemed to have missed. I could not understand how it was that Shakespeare set so high a value on his young friend marrying. He himself had married young and the result had been unhappiness, and it was not likely that he would have asked Willie Hughes to commit the same error. The boy-player of Rosalind had nothing to gain from marriage, or from the passions of real life. The early sonnets with their strange entreaties to have children seemed to me a jarring note. The explanation of the mystery came on me quite suddenly, and I found it in the curious dedication. It will be remembered that this dedication was as follows:





“TO. THE. ONLIE. BEGETTER.

OF THESE. INSUING. SONNETS.

MR. W.H.

ALL. HAPPINESSE. AND THAT. ETERNITIE.

PROMISED. BY. OUR. EVER-LIVING. POET.

WISHETH. THE. WELL-WISHING.

ADVENTURER. IN. SETTING. FORTH

T.T.”





Some scholars have supposed that the word “begetter” in this dedication means simply the procurer of the Sonnets for Thomas Thorpe the publisher; but this view is now generally abandoned, and the highest authorities are quite agreed that it is to be taken in the sense of inspirer, the metaphor being drawn from the analogy of physical life. Now I saw that the same metaphor was used by Shakespeare himself all through the poems, and this set me on the right track. Finally I made my great discovery. The marriage that Shakespeare proposes for Willie Hughes is the “marriage with his Muse” an expression which is definitely put forward in Sonnet LXXXII where, in the bitterness of his heart at the defection of the boy-actor for whom he had written his greatest parts, and whose beauty had indeed suggested them, he opens his complaint by saying:





I grant thou wert not married to my Muse.





The children he begs him to beget are no children of flesh and blood, but more immortal children of undying fame. The whole cycle of the early sonnets is simply Shakespeare's invitation to Willie Hughes to go upon the stage and become a player. How barren and profitless a thing, he says, is this beauty of yours if it be not used:





When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,

And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,

Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,

Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:

Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,

Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,

To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,

Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.





You must create something in art: my verse “is thine, and born of thee;” only listen to me and, I will “bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date,” and you shall people with forms of your own image the imaginary world of the stage. These children that you beget, he continues, will not wither away, as mortal children do, but you shall live in them and in my plays: do but:





Make thee another self, for love of me,

That beauty still may live in thine or thee!





I collected all the passages that seemed to me to corroborate this view, and they produced a strong impression on me, and showed me how complete Cyril Graham's theory really was. I also saw that it was quite easy to separate those lines in which shakespeare speaks of the Sonnets themselves from those in which he speaks of his great dramatic work. This was a point that had been entirely overlooked by all the critics up to Cyril Graham's day. And yet it was one of the most important points in the whole series of poems. To the Sonnets Shakespeare was more or less indifferent. He did not wish to rest his fame on them. They were to him his “slight Muse,” as he calls them, and intended, as Meres tells us, for private circulation only among a few, a very few, friends. Upon the other hand he was extremely conscious of the high artistic value of his plays, and shows a noble self-reliance upon his dramatic genius. When he says to Willie Hughes:





But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;

Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,

When in eternal lines to time thou growest:

So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

So long lives this and this gives life to thee; ——





the expression “eternal lines” clearly alludes to one of his plays that he was sending him at the time, just as the concluding couplet points to his confidence in the probability of his plays being always acted. In his address to the Dramatic Muse (Sonnets C and CI) we find the same feeling.





Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long

To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?

Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,

Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?





he cries, and he then proceeds to reproach the Mistress of Tragedy and Comedy for her “neglect of truth in beauty dyed,” and says:





Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?

Excuse not silence so, for 't lies in thee

To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,

And to be praised of ages yet to be.

Then do thy office, Muse, I teach thee how,

To make him seem long hence as he shows now.





It is, however, perhaps in Sonnet LV that Shakespeare gives to this idea its fullest expression. To imagine that the “powerful rhyme” of the second line refers to the sonnet itself was entirely to mistake Shakespeare's meaning. It seemed to me that it was extremely likely, from the general character of the sonnet, that a particular play was meant, and that the play was none other but Romeo and Juliet.





Not marble, nor the gilded monuments

Of princes shall outlive this powerful rhyme;

But you shall shine more bright in these contents

Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time.

When wasteful wars shall statues overturn,

And broils root out the work of masonry,

Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn

The living record of your memory

'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity

Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room

Even in the eyes of all posterity

That wear this world out to the ending doom.

So, till the judgment that yourself arise,

You live in this, and dwell in lovers' eyes.





It was also extremely suggestive to note how here as elsewhere Shakespeare promised Willie Hughes immortality in a form that appealed to men's eyes——that is to say, in a spectacular form, in a play that is to be looked at.

For two weeks I worked hard at the Sonnets, hardly ever going out, and refusing all invitations. Every day I seemed to be discovering something new, and Willie Hughes became to me a kind of spiritual presence, an ever-dominant personality. I could almost fancy that I saw him standing in the shadow of my room, so well had Shakespeare drawn him, with his golden hair, his tender flower-like grace, his dreamy deep-sunken eyes, his delicate mobile limbs, and his white lily hands. His very name fascinated me. Willie Hughes! Willie Hughes! How musically it sounded! Yes; who else but he could have been the master-mistress of Shakespeare's passion,[1] the lord of his love to whom he was bound in vassalage,[2] the delicate minion of pleasure,[3] the rose of the whole world,[4] the herald of the spring[5] decked in the proud livery of youth,[6] the lovely boy whom it was sweet music to hear,[7] and whose beauty was the very raiment of Shakespeare's heart,[8] as it was the keystone of his dramatic power? How bitter now seemed the whole tragedy of his desertion and his shame! ——shame that he made sweet and lovely[9] by the mere magic of his personality, but that was none the less shame. Yet as Shakespeare forgave him, should not we forgive him also? I did not care to pry into the mystery of his sin. His abandonment of Shakespeare's theatre was a different matter, and I investigated it at great length. Finally I came to the conclusion that Cyril Graham had been wrong in regarding the rival dramatist of Sonnet LXXX as Chapman. It was obviously Marlowe who was alluded to. At the time the Sonnets were written, such an expression as “the proud full sail of his great verse” could not possibly have been used of Chapman's work, however applicable it might have been to the style of his later Jacobean plays. No: Marlowe was clearly the rival dramatist of whom Shakespeare spoke in such laudatory terms; and that:





Affable familiar ghost

Which nightly gulls him with intelligence,





was the Mephistophiles of his Doctor Faustus. No doubt, Marlowe was fascinated by the beauty and grace of the boy-actor, and lured him away from the Blackfriars Theatre, that he might play the Gaveston of his Edward II. That Shakespeare had some legal right to retain Willie Hughes in his own company seems evident from Sonnet LXXXVII, where he says:





Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,

And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:

The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;

My bonds in thee are all determinate.

For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?

And for that riches where is my deserving?

The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,

And so my patent back again is swerving.

Thyself thou gay'st, thy own worth then not knowing,

Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;

So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,

Comes home again, on better judgement making.

Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,

In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.

But him whom he could not hold by love, he would not hold by force. Willie Hughes became a member of Lord Pembroke's company, and perhaps in the open yard of the Red Bull Tavern, played the part of King Edward's delicate minion. On Marlowe's death, he seems to have returned to Shakespeare, who, whatever his fellow-partners may have thought of the matter, was not slow to forgive the wilfulness and treachery of the young actor.

How well, too, had Shakespeare drawn the temperament of the stage-player! Willie Hughes was one of those:





That do not do the thing they most do show,

Who, moving others, are themselves as stone.





He could act love, but could not feel it, could mimic passion without realising it.





In many's looks the false heart's history

Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,





but with Willie Hughes it was not so. “Heaven,” says Shakespeare, in a sonnet of mad idolatry:





Heaven in thy creation did decree

That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;

Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,

Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.





In his “inconstant mind” and his “false heart,” it was easy to recognise the insincerity and treachery that somehow seem inseparable from the artistic nature, as in his love of praise, that desire for immediate recognition that characterises all actors. And yet, more fortunate in this than other actors, Willie Hughes was to know something of immortality. Inseparably connected with Shakespeare's plays, he was to live in them.





Your name from hence immortal life shall have,

Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:

The earth can yield me but a common grave,

When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.

Your monument shall be my gentle verse,

Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,

And tongues to be your being shall rehearse,

When all the breathers of this world are dead.





There were endless allusions, also, to Willie Hughes's power over his audience——the “gazers,” as Shakespeare calls them; but perhaps the most perfect description of his wonderful mastery over dramatic art was in A Lover's Complaint, where Shakespeare says of him:





In him a plenitude of subtle matter,

Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,

Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,

Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,

In either's aptness, as it best deceives,

To blush at speeches rank, to weep at woes,

Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.





So on the tip of his subduing tongue,

All kind of arguments and questions deep,

All replication prompt and reason strong,

For his advantage still did wake and sleep,

To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep.

He had the dialect and the different skill,

Catching all passions in his craft of will.





Once I thought that I had really found Willie Hughes in Elizabethan literature. In a wonderfully graphic account of the last days of the great Earl of Essex, his chaplain, Thomas Knell, tells us that the night before the Earl died, “he called William Hewes, which was his musician, to play upon the virginals and to sing.‘Play,’ said he, ‘my song, Will Hewes, and I will sing it to myself.’ So he did it most joyfully, not as the howling swan, which, still looking down, waileth her end, but as a sweet lark, lifting up his hands and casting up his eyes to his God, with this mounted the crystal skies, and reached with his unwearied tongue the top of highest heavens.” Surely the boy who played on the virginals to the dying father of Sidney's Stella was none other but the Will Hews to whom Shakespeare dedicated the Sonnets, and who he tells us was himself sweet “music to hear.” Yet Lord Essex died in 1576, when Shakespeare himself was but twelve years of age. It was impossible that his musician could have been the Mr. W.H. of the Sonnets. Perhaps Shakespeare's young friend was the son of the player upon the virginals? It was at least something to have discovered that Will Hews was an Elizabethan name. Indeed the name Hews seemed to have been closely connected with music and the stage. The first English actress was the lovely Margaret Hews, whom Prince Rupert so madly loved. What more probable than that between her and Lord Essex's musician had come the boy-actor of Shakespeare's plays? But the proofs, the links——where were they? Alas! I could not find them. It seemed to me that I was always on the brink of absolute verification, but that I could never really attain to it.

From Willie Hughes's life I soon passed to thoughts of his death. I used to wonder what had been his end.

Perhaps he had been one of those English actors who in 1604 went across sea to Germany and played before the great Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick, himself a dramatist of no mean order, and at the Court of that strange Elector of Brandenburg, who was so enamoured of beauty that he was said to have bought for his weight in amber the young son of a travelling Greek merchant, and to have given pageants in honour of his slave all through that dreadful famine year of 1606-7, when the people died of hunger in the very streets of the town, and for the space of seven months there was no rain. We know at any rate that Romeo and Juliet was brought out at Dresden in 1613, along with Hamlet and King Lear, and it was surely to none other than Willie Hughes that in 1615 the death-mask of Shakespeare was brought by the hand of one of the suite of the English ambassador, pale token of the passing away of the great poet who had so dearly loved him. Indeed there would have been something peculiarly fitting in the idea that the boy-actor, whose beauty had been so vital an element in the realism and romance of Shakespeare's art, should have been the first to have brought to Germany the seed of the new culture, and was in his way the precursor of that Aufklärung or Illumination of the eighteenth century, that splendid movement which, though begun by Lessing and Herder, and brought to its full and perfect issue by Goethe, was in no small part helped on by another actor——Friedrich Schroeder——who awoke the popular consciousness, and by means of the feigned passions and mimetic methods of the stage showed the intimate, the vital, connection between life and literature. If this was so——and there was certainly no evidence against it——it was not improbable that Willie Hughes was one of those English comedians (mimae quidam ex Britannia, as the old chronicle calls them), who were slain at Nuremberg in a sudden uprising of the people, and were secretly buried in a little vineyard outside the city by some young men “who had found pleasure in their performances, and of whom some had sought to be instructed in the mysteries of the new art.” Certainly no more fitting place could there be for him to whom Shakespeare said, “thou art all my art,” than this little vineyard outside the city walls. For was it not from the sorrows of Dionysos that Tragedy sprang? Was not the light laughter of Comedy, with its careless merriment and quick replies, first heard on the lips of the Sicilian vine-dressers? Nay, did not the purple and red stain of the wine-froth on face and limbs give the first suggestion of the charm and fascination of disguise——the desire for self-concealment, the sense of the value of objectivity thus showing itself in the rude beginnings of the art? At any rate, wherever he lay——whether in the little vineyard at the gate of the Gothic town, or in some dim London churchyard amidst the roar and bustle of our great city——no gorgeous monument marked his resting-place. His true tomb, as Shakespeare saw, was the poet's verse, his true monument the permanence of the drama. So had it been with others whose beauty had given a new creative impulse to their age. The ivory body of the Bithynian slave rots in the green ooze of the Nile, and on the yellow hills of the Cerameicus is strewn the dust of the young Athenian; but Antinous lives in sculpture, and Charmides in philosophy.





Chapter 3


After three weeks had elapsed, I determined to make a strong appeal to Erskine to do justice to the memory of Cyril Graham, and to give to the world his marvellous interpretation of the Sonnets——the only interpretation that thoroughly explained the problem. I have not any copy of my letter, I regret to say, nor have I been able to lay my hand upon the original; but I remember that I went over the whole ground, and covered sheets of paper with passionate reiteration of the arguments and proofs that my study had suggested to me. It seemed to me that I was not merely restoring Cyril Graham to his proper place in literary history, but rescuing the honour of Shakespeare himself from the tedious memory of a commonplace intrigue. I put into the letter all my enthusiasm. I put into the letter all my faith.

No sooner, in fact, had I sent it off than a curious reaction came over me. It seemed to me that I had given away my capacity for belief in the Willie Hughes theory of the Sonnets, that something had gone out of me, as it were, and that I was perfectly indifferent to the whole subject. What was it that had happened? It is difficult to say. Perhaps, by finding perfect expression for a passion, I had exhausted the passion itself. Emotional forces, like the forces of physical life, have their positive limitations. Perhaps the mere effort to convert any one to a theory involves some form of renunciation of the power of credence. Perhaps I was simply tired of the whole thing, and, my enthusiasm having burnt out, my reason was left to its own unimpassioned judgment. However it came about, and I cannot pretend to explain it, there was no doubt that Willie Hughes suddenly became to me a mere myth, an idle dream, the boyish fancy of a young man who, like most ardent spirits, was more anxious to convince others than to be himself convinced.

As I had said some very unjust and bitter things to Erskine in my letter, I determined to go and see him at once, and to make my apologies to him for my behaviour. Accordingly, the next morning I drove down to Birdcage Walk, and found Erskine sitting in his library, with the forged picture of Willie Hughes in front of him.

“My dear Erskine!” I cried, “I have come to apologise to you.”

“To apologise to me?” he said. “What for?”

“For my letter,” I answered.

“You have nothing to regret in your letter,” he said. “On the contrary, you have done me the greatest service in your power. You have shown me that Cyril Graham's theory is perfectly sound.”

“You don't mean to say that you believe in Willie Hughes?” I exclaimed.

“Why not?” he rejoined. “You have proved the thing to me. Do you think I cannot estimate the value of evidence?”

“But there is no evidence at all,” I groaned, sinking into a chair. “When I wrote to you I was under the influence of a perfectly silly enthusiasm. I had been touched by the story of Cyril Graham's death, fascinated by his romantic theory, enthralled by the wonder and novelty of the whole idea. I see now that the theory is based on a delusion. The only evidence for the existence of Willie Hughes is that picture in front of you, and the picture is a forgery. Don't be carried away by mere sentiment in this matter. Whatever romance may have to say about the Willie Hughes theory, reason is dead against it.”

“I don't understand you,” said Erskine, looking at me in amazement. “Why, you yourself have convinced me by your letter that Willie Hughes is an absolute reality. Why have you changed your mind? Or is all that you have been saying to me merely a joke?”

“I cannot explain it to you,” I rejoined, “but I see now that there is really nothing to be said in favour of Cyril Graham's interpretation. The Sonnets are addressed to Lord Pembroke. For heaven's sake don't waste your time in a foolish attempt to discover a young Elizabethan actor who never existed, and to make a phantom puppet the centre of the great cycle of Shakespeare's sonnets.”

“I see that you don't understand the theory,” he replied.

“My dear Erskine,” I cried, “not understand it! Why, I feel as if I had invented it. Surely my letter shows you that I not merely went into the whole matter, but that I contributed proofs of every kind. The one flaw in the theory is that it presupposes the existence of the person whose existence is the subject of dispute. If we grant that there was in Shakespeare's company a young actor of the name of Willie Hughes, it is not difficult to make him the object of the sonnets. But as we know that there was no actor of this name in the company of the Globe Theatre, it is idle to pursue the investigation further.”

“But that is exactly what we don't know,” said Erskine. “It is quite true that his name does not occur in the list given in the first folio; but, as Cyril pointed out, that is rather a proof in favour of the existence of Willie Hughes than against it, if we remember his treacherous desertion of Shakespeare for a rival dramatist.”

We argued the matter over for hours, but nothing that I could say could make Erskine surrender his faith in Cyril Graham's interpretation. He told me that he intended to devote his life to proving the theory, and that he was determined to do justice to Cyril Graham's memory. I entreated him, laughed at him, begged of him, but it was of no use. Finally we parted, not exactly in anger, but certainly with a shadow between us. He thought me shallow, I thought him foolish. When I called on him again his servant told me that he had gone to Germany.

Two years afterwards, as I was going into my club, the hall-porter handed me a letter with a foreign postmark. It was from Erskine, and written at the Hôtel d'Angleterre, Cannes. When I had read it I was filled with horror, though I did not quite believe that he would be so mad as to carry his resolve into execution. The gist of the letter was that he had tried in every way to verify the Willie Hughes theory, and had failed, and that as Cyril Graham had given his life for this theory, he himself had determined to give his own life also to the same cause. The concluding words of the letter were these: “I still believe in Willie Hughes; and by the time you receive this, I shall have died by my own hand for Willie Hughes's sake: for his sake, and for the sake of Cyril Graham, whom I drove to his death by my shallow scepticism and ignorant lack of faith. The truth was once revealed to you, and you rejected it. It comes to you now stained with the blood of two lives——do not turn away from it.”

It was a horrible moment. I felt sick with misery, and yet I could not believe it. To die for one's theological beliefs is the worst use a man can make of his life, but to die for a literary theory! It seemed impossible.

I looked at the date. The letter was a week old. Some unfortunate chance had prevented my going to the club for several days, or I might have got it in time to save him. Perhaps it was not too late. I drove off to my rooms, packed up my things, and started by the night-mail from Charing Cross. The journey was intolerable. I thought I would never arrive.

As soon as I did I drove to the Hôtel l'Angleterre. They told me that Erskine had been buried two days before in the English cemetery. There was something horribly grotesque about the whole tragedy. I said all kinds of wild things, and the people in the hall looked curiously at me.

Suddenly Lady Erskine, in deep mourning, passed across the vestibule. When she saw me she came up to me, murmured something about her poor son, and burst into tears. I led her into her sitting-room. An elderly gentleman was there waiting for her. It was the English doctor.

We talked a great deal about Erskine, but I said nothing about his motive for committing suicide. It was evident that he had not told his mother anything about the reason that had driven him to so fatal, so mad an act. Finally Lady Erskine rose and said, “George left you something as a memento. It was a thing he prized very much. I will get it for you.”

As soon as she had left the room I turned to the doctor and said, “What a dreadful shock it must have been to Lady Erskine! I wonder that she bears it as well as she does.”

“Oh, she knew for months past that it was coming,” he answered.

“Knew it for months past!” I cried. “But why didn't she stop him? Why didn't she have him watched? He must have been mad.”

The doctor stared at me. “I don't know what you mean,” he said.

“Well,” I cried, “if a mother knows that her son is going to commit suicide——”

“Suicide!” he answered. “Poor Erskine did not commit suicide. He died of consumption. He came here to die. The moment I saw him I knew that there was no hope. One lung was almost gone, and the other was very much affected. Three days before he died he asked me was there any hope. I told him frankly that there was none, and that he had only a few days to live. He wrote some letters, and was quite resigned, retaining his senses to the last.”

At that moment Lady Erskine entered the room with the fatal picture of Willie Hughes in her hand. “When George was dying he begged me to give you this,” she said. As I took it from her, her tears fell on my hand.

The picture hangs now in my library, where it is very much admired by my artistic friends. They have decided that it is not a Clouet, but an Oudry. I have never cared to tell them its true history. But sometimes, when I look at it, I think that there is really a great deal to be said for the Willie Hughes theory of Shakespeare's sonnets.
