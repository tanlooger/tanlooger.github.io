第一章　误闯的门


这个故事发生在很久以前，那时候你的爷爷还是个孩子呢。这个故事十分重要，因为它交代了我们这个世界和纳尼亚王国间发生的所有故事的来龙去脉。

那会儿，歇洛克·福尔摩斯仍住在贝克街(1)，而巴斯塔布尔一家还在路易斯罕大道上探宝呢(2)。那会儿，你要是个小男孩儿，就不得不天天穿着领子硬邦邦的伊顿服，而学校嘛，比起现在的总要糟糕得多。不过，饭菜可比现在的可口；要说糖果，我真不忍心告诉你有多便宜多好吃，因为那只会害你白白流口水。就在那个时候，伦敦城里住着一位小女孩儿，她的名字叫波莉·普卢默。

她住的地方，房子一幢紧挨着一幢，连成长长一排，她就住在其中的一幢里。一天早上，她刚出门来到后花园里，便看见一个男孩儿从隔壁花园攀上来，扒着墙头露出一张脸。波莉吓了一大跳，因为迄今为止，那幢房子除了老单身汉凯特利先生和老处女凯特利小姐兄妹俩以外，没住过任何小孩子。因此她抬头看着，满心好奇。那个陌生男孩的脸脏兮兮的，就算他把双手在泥里搓几下，接着大哭一场，再用泥手擦干眼泪，也不至于脏成那样。其实呵，他刚才差不多就这么做的。

“喂！”波莉喊道。

“嘿，”那男孩应了一声。“你叫什么名字？”

“波莉，”女孩说。“你呢？”

“迪格雷，”男孩答道。

“哎哟，这名字也太滑稽了！”波莉说。

“要说滑稽嘛，哪比得上波莉，”迪格雷回敬道。

“就是很滑稽，”波莉说。

“就是不滑稽，”迪格雷反驳道。

“不管怎样，我可经常洗脸的，”波莉说，“你真该去洗一把脸，尤其当你——”她说到这里停住了，本想说“当你哭过鼻子以后”，但想想这么说不太礼貌。

“被你说着了，我就是哭鼻子啦，”迪格雷把嗓门提高了许多，像一个悲伤过度的男孩不在乎谁知道自己哭过一样。“换了你也要哭呢，”他继续说，“要是你从小住在乡下，有一匹小马，花园尽头有条小河，然后却被带到这么个鬼地方来住的话。”

“伦敦可不是啥鬼地方，”波莉气愤地说。但男孩说得太起劲了，压根儿不去注意她，他接着说：

“要是你爸爸远在印度，你不得不过来跟你姨妈和舅舅住在一起，你舅舅又是疯疯癫癫的，那样谁受得了啊？而这都是因为他们正在照看你妈妈，你妈妈病了，病得快……快断气了。”话一说完，他脸上浮现出奇怪的表情，像是要努力把眼泪收回去。

“我一点儿都不知道，真抱歉啊，”波莉低声下气地道歉。接着，她因为实在不知道该说些什么，又为了使迪格雷转到愉快的话题上，便问：

“凯特利先生果真疯啦？”

“唔，他要么疯啦，”迪格雷回答，“要么就另有隐情。他在顶楼有间书房，蕾蒂姨妈叮嘱过，我决不能进那屋去。呀，这就够可疑的啦。还有呢，他总不爱搭理蕾蒂姨妈，而一旦吃饭时他想要对我说些什么，姨妈就叫他闭嘴。她会说：‘别去烦这孩子，安德鲁。’或者：‘我敢肯定迪格雷不想听你那破事儿。’或者：‘嘿，迪格雷，你不想去外面花园里玩吗？’”

“他想说的是啥事儿？”

“我不知道。他也从来不肯多说。哦，还有件事儿。有天夜里，就是昨夜，我经过阁楼楼梯去睡觉时（我不喜欢打那儿路过），我很肯定自己听见了一声叫喊。”

“他弄不好关了个疯老婆在那里吧。”

“对呀，我当时也这么想。”

“要不然，他是在造假币。”

“要不然他就是个海盗，像《金银岛》里开头那人一样，老在躲避以前船上的同伙。”

“真带劲儿！”波莉说，“我从来没有料到你们那幢房子居然那么有趣。”

“你想想是有趣，”迪格雷说，“但要你睡在那里，你就不乐意了。你总不愿意躺着睡不着的时候，听着安德鲁舅舅的脚步沿着走廊向你屋子悄悄踱过来吧？再说了，他的眼神也太可怕了。”

暑假才刚刚开始，那年，波莉和迪格雷谁也没去海边玩，所以几乎天天见面。他俩就这么认识了。

他俩的冒险拉开了序幕，主要因为那是多年来最潮湿、最阴冷的夏天之一，他们不得不待在屋内活动：换句话说——在屋内探险。手持一小截蜡烛，在一所大房子或一排房子里寻啊探啊的，别提有多带劲儿啦。波莉很早就发现，打开他家阁楼储藏室的一扇小门，便能看见蓄水池后面有块黑漆漆的地方，加点儿小心就能钻进去。里面像是条长长的隧道，一边是砖砌的墙，另一边是斜屋顶。屋顶的石板间有缝隙，透进丝丝缕缕的光线。隧道里没有地板，你不得不从一根椽子跨到另一根椽子，椽子间只铺了层灰泥，要是踩上了灰泥，你就会跌穿天花板掉进下面的房间。波莉已在靠近蓄水池旁的隧道里占了块地方，他们称之为“走私者的密洞”。她将旧包装箱的木片啊，破厨房椅的座板啊之类的东西搬上去，搭在椽子与椽子之间，铺成一小方地板。她还在那里藏了一个钱柜，里面装着各式各样的宝贝，以及一本她正在写的小说，通常还有几个苹果。她常上那儿去偷偷喝上一瓶姜啤，喝完的旧酒瓶子使那里看上去更像一个“走私者的密洞”了。

迪格雷非常喜欢那个“密洞”（她可不会给他看那本小说），不过更吸引他的则是探险。

“嗨，你看，”他说，“这条隧道有多长呢？我是说，伸到你家房子边上就到底了吗？”

“不，”波莉说，“墙并没有朝屋顶倒下去，隧道一直向前延伸，不知道它有多长。”

“那么，我们就能把整排房子都走通喽。”

“能呀，”波莉说。“哦，对了！”

“怎么啦？”

“我们能踏进别人的房子里去。”

“对喽，再被人当成夜贼抓起来！可别干那傻事儿。”

“耍贫嘴！我刚刚一直想着你家后面的那幢房子呢。”

“它怎么啦？”

“哦，那是幢空房子。爸爸说，打从我们搬来，它就一直空着。”

“我们真该去侦察一番，”迪格雷提议。他嘴上说得轻巧，内心可比你想的激动多啦。因为，正像你一样，他想来想去也想不明白，那幢房子为啥空了那么久呢。波莉也一样直犯嘀咕。然而，他俩谁也没提“闹鬼”二字。他俩都觉得，一旦一件事情说干而不去干，就显得太懦弱了。

“我们现在就进去探一探？”迪格雷说。

“行，”波莉说。

“要是你不情愿就甭去了，”迪格雷说。

“你要有胆，我就奉陪，”波莉说。

“可我们怎么知道恰好到了隔壁那一幢房子呢？”

他俩决定先退回到储藏室，然后以两根椽子的间距为一步，这样，从储藏室这头走到那头，就能弄明白要跨过多少根椽子才能走完一个房间了。接着，他们给波莉家两个阁楼间的过道留出四根多椽子的距离，给女仆的卧室算上差不多储藏室的距离。这样，他们便得出了那幢房子的总长度。走完这个长度的两倍，便能到达迪格雷家房子的尽头；只要再往前碰到一扇门，进去就是那座空宅的阁楼了。

“可我预料那房子其实不是空的，”迪格雷说。

“你料到会是怎么个情况？”

“我猜有一个人偷偷住在那里，他只在深夜出没，手里提一盏昏暗的灯笼。我们兴许能发现一伙不要命的歹徒，还会得到奖赏呢。要说一幢空了多年的房子没一点儿秘密，可真是胡说八道。”

“爸爸觉得里面一定是下水道，”波莉说。

“唉！大人们总爱把事情解释得很没趣，”迪格雷说。因为他们是在光天化日之下的阁楼里，而不是在“走私者的密洞”里秉烛夜谈，空宅闹鬼的可能性便看起来很小了。

他们测出阁楼的长度后，便提起铅笔计算房子的总长。起先算出来一人一个答案，即使后来答案一致了，我也不敢肯定他们是否真算对了。他俩都迫不及待地要踏上探险的旅程。

“咱们决不能弄出半点儿声响，”波莉告诫道。这会儿，他俩正从蓄水池后面再次钻进隧道。此次任务非同小可，因此俩人手里各持一支蜡烛（波莉在她的“密洞”里藏了好多蜡烛呢）。

黑漆漆的隧道里积满了灰尘，还不时有冷风灌入。他们从这根椽子踩到那根椽子，默默前进，偶尔相互耳语一句：“走到你家阁楼对面啦”，或者“在我家中间啦”。俩人谁也没绊倒过，谁的蜡烛也没熄灭过。最后，他俩来到一个地方，只见右边的砖墙上有扇小门，门的这一面既无门闩也无把手，想必这扇门是做来只让人进，不让人出的；但门上有个挂钩（就是碗柜里常见的那种），他俩觉得肯定能转动它。

“要我去吗？”迪格雷问。

“你要有胆，我就奉陪，”波莉又这么说道。俩人都觉得大事临头了，但是谁也没有退缩。迪格雷费了番劲儿才把挂钩旋开。

门呼啦一下开了，太阳光猛地射了进来，使他们忍不住眯缝起眼睛。紧接着，他们便惊呆了。展现在他们眼前的并非一间废弃的阁楼，而是一间陈设考究的屋子，但看起来还是空荡荡的，一派死寂。波莉受不住好奇心的驱使，吹灭了蜡烛，像耗子一样悄悄溜进了那间诡异的屋子。

屋子固然形似阁楼，却布置得像一间起居室。靠墙满满排列着架子，架子上满满堆放着书籍。壁炉里烧着火（你还记得那是个阴冷而潮湿的夏天吧），壁炉前面一把高背扶手椅背对着他俩放着。在波莉和扶手椅之间，摆着一张大桌子，占去屋子中央的一大半空间，桌子上堆满了各式各样的东西——书本、笔记本、墨水瓶、钢笔、封蜡，还有一台显微镜。不过，波莉首先注意到的是一只锃亮的红色木托盘，里面盛放着好几枚戒指。这些戒指成对成双地放着——一黄一绿，隔点距离，又是一黄一绿。它们也就和普通戒指一般大小，但是太耀眼了，没人会对它们视若无睹。它们简直是你所能想象的最美丽、最闪亮的小珍宝了。要是波莉年纪再小一些，说不定要抓一枚塞到嘴里去呢。

屋子里静悄悄的，你立马能听到时钟的嘀嗒声。然而，波莉又发现，屋里并非一点儿动静都没有。有一种微弱的——非常非常微弱的——嗡嗡声。假如那时候已经发明了吸尘器，波莉会以为那声音是一段距离以外的吸尘器工作时传来的——来自几间屋子以外或几层楼以下。可是她听到的声音更柔美，更富音乐感：只是微弱得让你几乎听不见。

“太棒了，这儿没人，”波莉扭头对迪格雷说道。这会儿，她讲得比耳语要大声了。迪格雷也紧跟着从隧道里钻了出来，眨巴着眼睛，他看上去脏极了——其实波莉也不干净。

“好什么？”他说道，“这根本不是间空屋子。我们最好在有人进来前就开溜。”

“你看那是些什么？”波莉指着彩色戒指问。

“嘿，别磨蹭，”迪格雷催促着，“快点儿——”

话才说到一半，事情就发生了。火炉前的那张高背椅突然转动了，从座椅上升起一个可怕的身影——仿佛舞台地板的活动门一开，钻出个哑剧中的魔鬼，安德鲁舅舅出现在了他们面前。他俩进的那间屋子并非空的，而是迪格雷家那间禁止入内的书房！两个孩子“噢——噢——”地叫了起来，终于反应过来他们犯了个严重的错误。他们觉得早该知道自己走得还不够远。

安德鲁舅舅又高又瘦，长脸，尖鼻，一头灰发乱蓬蓬的，胡子刮得干干净净，一对眼睛贼亮贼亮。

迪格雷吓得一句话都讲不出来，因为安德鲁舅舅看起来要比以前可怕一千倍。波莉起先还有点儿胆子，可马上就吓怕了。因为安德鲁舅舅做的第一件事儿，便是穿过屋子走到门口，砰地关上门，锁了起来。接着，他转过身来，那双贼亮的眼睛直勾勾地盯着那两个孩子，一笑，露出了满口的牙。

“这下好了！”他说，“我那傻瓜妹妹终于找不到你们了！”

这简直不像一个大人该干的事儿。波莉的心都提到嗓子眼了。她和迪格雷开始向他俩进来的那扇小门退去。安德鲁舅舅动作比他们快，他冲到他们背后，将那扇门也关上了。安德鲁舅舅挡在了门口，然后搓着双手，将指关节掰得咔咔作响。他的手指修长而白皙。

“真高兴见到你们，”他说，“我正需要两个孩子呢。”

“求求你，凯特利先生，”波莉恳求道。“快吃饭了，我要回家，求求你放我们走吧，好不好？”

“现在可不行，”安德鲁舅舅说，“机会难得，机不可失啊。我需要两个孩子。瞧，我的伟大实验刚做了一半。我用一只豚鼠实验了一回，貌似可行，可豚鼠没办法跟你说话，而你也不能告诉它怎么回来。”

“瞧，安德鲁舅舅，”迪格雷说，“真的是吃饭时间了，他们要来找我们了。你必须放我们出去！”

“必须？”安德鲁舅舅说。

迪格雷和波莉面面相觑。他俩不敢说一句话，但眼神却似乎在说：“这太可怕了，不是吗？”“我们得顺着他。”

“你要是现在放我们回去吃饭，”波莉说，“我们吃完饭就会回来。”

“啊，我怎么知道你们会回来？”安德鲁舅舅狡猾地一笑，看似要改变主意。

“好吧，好吧，”他说，“如果你们真要走，我想你们也该走了。我不指望你们这俩小家伙会喜欢跟我这么个老家伙谈话的。”他叹了口气，继续说：“你们不会明白，我有时候多么孤独啊。好吧，吃饭去吧。但临走前我得送你们一件礼物。真难得，在我这间脏兮兮的旧书房里碰到了一位小姑娘；尤其是，这么说吧，像你这样讨人喜欢的姑娘。”

波莉慢慢觉得，他也许并没疯。

“你不想要一枚戒指吗，亲爱的？”安德鲁舅舅问波莉。

“你是说在那些黄的绿的里面挑一枚吗？”波莉说，“真好看啊！”

“不是绿的，”安德鲁舅舅对她说，“我恐怕不能把绿的送人。但我很乐意送你一枚黄的，并奉上我的爱心。来吧，试试。”

波莉现在已差不多克服了恐惧，她相信这位老先生并没有疯，并觉得这些亮闪闪的戒指确实有种奇异的魔力，吸引她朝着托盘走去。

“啊！我弄明白了，”她喊道，“那嗡嗡声在这儿变大了，看来正是这几枚戒指发出的。”

“想得多妙，亲爱的，”安德鲁舅舅笑了起来。那笑声听起来很自然，然而，迪格雷却从他脸上看出一种迫不及待的、几近贪婪的神色。

“波莉，别犯傻！”他叫了起来，“别碰戒指！”

一切都晚了。正在他叫喊时，波莉已伸手碰到了其中一枚戒指。就在那一刹，没有闪光，没有声响，也没有任何征兆，波莉不见了。屋子里只剩下迪格雷和他的安德鲁舅舅两个人。

第二章　迪格雷和他的舅舅


事情发生得太突然了，那么恐怖的事儿，迪格雷在噩梦里都没遇上过，他不禁尖叫了一声。安德鲁舅舅赶紧捂住他的嘴。“别叫！”他在迪格雷耳边嘀咕说，“你要是再叫，你母亲可就听到喽。你知道，她可要受多大的惊吓。”

正如迪格雷后来说的，这种卑鄙的要挟手段实在令他感到厌恶。不过，他当然没敢再叫。

“这样才对，”安德鲁舅舅说，“也许你是管不住嘴才叫起来的。第一次看见一个人消失是会惊讶的。哎呀，昨晚那只豚鼠的消失也着实把我吓了一大跳。”

“就在那时你叫了一声？”迪格雷问。

“哦，你听见了？我希望你没有刺探我吧？”

“没有，”迪格雷气愤地说，“但波莉到底怎么啦？”

“祝贺我吧，亲爱的孩子，”安德鲁舅舅搓着手道，“我的实验成功啦。那个小女孩走啦——消失啦——离开这个世界啦。”

“你拿她怎样了？”

“把她送到——啊——另一个地方去了。”

“你这么说是什么意思？”迪格雷问。

安德鲁舅舅坐了下来，说：“好吧，就都告诉你吧。你听说过老莱菲夫人吗？”

“她不是伯祖母或别的什么亲戚吗？”迪格雷说。

“不完全是，”安德鲁舅舅说，“她是我的教母。看那边，墙上挂的就是她。”

迪格雷望过去，看见一幅褪了色的照片：一位头戴无边女帽的老太太的头像。他现在想起来了，有一次，他在乡下家中的一个旧抽屉里也见过这张头像。他问过母亲这是谁，但母亲好像不太愿意谈论这个话题。迪格雷心想，虽然几张旧照片说明不了什么，但那张脸确实一点都不好看。

“她有——她没有出什么问题吧，安德鲁舅舅？”他问道。

“这个嘛，”安德鲁舅舅嘿嘿一笑，说道，“得看你把什么当作有问题。人们总是满脑子偏见。她到了晚年的确非常古怪，干了些十分愚蠢的事情。所以人们把她关了起来。”

“你是说，关进了疯人院？”

“啊，不，不，不，”安德鲁舅舅吃惊地说，“不是那种地方，只是关在牢里。”

“不会吧！”迪格雷说，“她干了什么？”

“唉，可怜的女人，”安德鲁舅舅说，“她好傻，干了许多非同一般的事情。这些不必细说了。她待我一直不赖。”

“可是，所有这些关波莉什么事呢？我真希望你能——”

“别急，我的孩子，听我说完。”安德鲁舅舅继续说，“在莱菲夫人临死前，他们把她放了出来。弥留之际，她只允许几个人去看她，我就是其中一个。你知道的，她像我一样不喜欢平庸、无知的人，而且我俩趣味相投。就在她临死前几天，她嘱咐我去她家中找一张旧书桌，打开书桌的一个秘密抽屉，里面有一个小盒子，然后取出来带给她。我刚拿起那个盒子，手指就一阵刺痛，我敢说，在我手掌中的正是一个惊天大秘密。她把盒子交给我，并要我发誓，她一死，我就搞个仪式将盒子烧掉，决不能打开。结果我没有遵守诺言。”

“唉，你干得真不地道，”迪格雷说。

“不地道？”安德鲁舅舅面露迷惑的神色。“噢，我懂了。你是说小男孩们应该信守承诺。我确信这是对的：千真万确，理所应当。我很高兴你学会了这么做。可你一定得明白，这些规矩不论对小男孩、对仆人、对女人、对普通人来说有多好，都不适用于渊博的学者、伟大的思想家和圣人。怎么可能适合呢，迪格雷。像我这种有着神秘智慧的人，是不受普通规矩的束缚的，正如我们与常人的快乐也无缘。我的孩子，我们是命定高贵而孤独的。”

他边说边叹气，看上去又严肃，又高贵，又神秘，以至于有那么一瞬间，迪格雷真以为他在谈论的是些无比美妙的事情。然而，他一记起波莉消失前舅舅脸上那副丑恶的神态，就立刻看穿了这些高谈阔论背后的阴险伎俩。“他的意思是，”他自言自语道，“他觉得为了得到他想要的，就可以不择手段。”

“当然喽，”安德鲁舅舅说，“我很久都不敢打开那个盒子，因为我明白里面可能装着非常危险的东西。毕竟我的教母是个非同寻常的女人。实际上，她是我们这个国家具有女妖血统的最后几个凡人之一。（她说与她同时代的还有两位，一位是公爵夫人，另一位是女清洁工。）其实，迪格雷，你正在跟很可能是最后一个有过女妖教母的人谈话。啊！这些事儿等你老了可有一番美好的回忆呢。”

“我敢打赌她是个坏女妖，”迪格雷心想。接着他大声说：“你到底把波莉怎么啦？”

“别老唠叨个没完，”安德鲁舅舅说，“有什么大不了的！我的首要任务当然是研究那个盒子。它很古老了。那时，我就很清楚，它既不是希腊的、古埃及的，也不是巴比伦的、赫梯的或中国的，它的年代要比那些民族久远得多。啊——我最终弄明白真相的那天可太伟大了。这个盒子出自阿特兰提斯，一个早已沉没了的岛屿。也就是说，它比欧洲出土的石器时代的文物还要早上几百年，而且也不像这些文物那样原始粗糙。因为阿特兰提斯在创世伊始就是座伟大的城市，有宫殿、庙宇和学者。”

说到这里他停顿了一下，似乎要等迪格雷开口。但迪格雷对他舅舅的厌恶一刻比一刻强，所以他闭口不言。

“同时，”安德鲁舅舅接着说，“我靠别的手段学到了不少魔法常识（跟一个小孩子解释这些可不合适）。这就意味着，我有希望弄明白盒子里究竟藏着些什么。通过各种各样的实验，我排除了许多可能性。我不得不结识了一批稀奇古怪的人，进行了一些令人讨厌的实验，我的头发都因此花白了。一个人不可能不付出任何代价就成为魔法师的。到最后，我的身体也垮了。可我在进步。终于，我彻底搞明白了。”

虽然根本不可能有人偷听，但他还是探过身来，几近耳语似的咕哝着：

“阿特兰提斯之盒里装着的是来自另一个世界的东西，那时候，我们的世界才混沌初开呢。”

“什么？”迪格雷问，不由自主地产生了兴趣。

“只是些泥土，”安德鲁舅舅说，“细腻、干燥的泥土。没啥可看的。你可能会说，辛苦一辈子就换来这么点儿东西，真说不出口。啊，可当我注视着这些泥土时（我尽量小心着不去碰它），想着每一粒可都来自另一个世界——你知道，我不是指另一个星球；它就在我们这个世界之中，你如果走得够远的话就能到达——可这的确是另一个世界——另一种大自然——另一种宇宙——即使你在我们这个宇宙空间中不停地走下去，也不能到达——这是个只能凭魔法才到得了的世界——天哪！”说到这里，安德鲁舅舅搓着双手，将指关节掰得爆竹似的啪啪乱响。

“我明白了，”他接着说，“你只有运用正确的方式，这些泥土才能把你带回它所属的世界。然而困难就在于找到正确的方式。我之前的实验都失败了。我拿豚鼠做实验，有一些死了，还有一些像小炸弹一样爆炸了。”

“干这样的事儿太残忍了，”迪格雷说，因为他自己也曾养过一只豚鼠。

“别老打岔！”安德鲁舅舅说，“这些畜生就是拿来做实验的，都是我自己买的。我想想——说到哪儿了？啊，对了，最后我终于成功了，用泥土做成了戒指：黄色的那几枚。但是，目前又遇到了新的困难。现在我敢确信，黄戒指可将任何触碰到它的生物送往另一个世界。但是，如果我不能将它们弄回来报告那边的情况，这又有什么用呢？”

“那它们可怎么办呀？”迪格雷问道，“要是回不来，它们可麻烦大了！”

“你老是从错误的角度看问题，”安德鲁舅舅显得有些不耐烦，“难道你就不明白这是项伟大的实验吗？把任何动物送往另一个世界正是为了让我搞清楚那个世界究竟是什么样的。”

“好吧，那你自己为什么不去？”

迪格雷从未见过谁像他舅舅那样被这么个简单的问题惹得又惊又气。“我？我去？”他嚷道，“这孩子一定疯了！要让我这把年纪，这把老骨头，去忍受被突然抛入另一个世界的震动和危险吗？我这辈子还没听说过如此荒谬的事情！你明白你在说什么吗？想想吧，另外一个世界意味着什么——任何事情你都可能遇上——任何事情。”

“我猜你一定把波莉送那儿去了，”迪格雷说，他气得满脸通红。“就算你是我舅舅，”他接着道，“我也要说，你简直是个胆小鬼，居然把一个女孩子送到连你自己都不敢去的地方。”

“闭嘴，老兄！”安德鲁舅舅将一只手按在桌子上，说，“我怎么能跟你这么个臭小子一般见识。你不会明白的，我是伟大的学者、魔法师、行家里手，正在进行一项实验，当然需要实验品啦。哎呀，你接下来会告诉我，应该在用豚鼠做实验前先征得它们的同意！要获得伟大的智慧就需要有牺牲。但要我亲自前往却是十足荒谬的想法，这就好比要求一个将军像普通士兵那样去冲锋陷阵。假如我死了，我毕生的事业该怎么办？”

“好了，别教训人了，”迪格雷说。“你还准备让波莉回来吗？”

“我刚才正要告诉你，你却粗鲁地打断了我，”安德鲁舅舅说。“最后，我终于找到了返回的办法。绿戒指能带你回来。”

“可波莉没带走绿戒指啊。”

“是没有，”安德鲁舅舅阴险地一笑。

“那么她就回不来啦，”迪格雷嚷道。“你这么做等于谋杀她。”

“她能回来，”安德鲁舅舅说，“只要有人前去找她，自己戴一枚黄戒指，再拿上两枚绿戒指，一枚可以让自己回来，另一枚让她回来。”

这时，迪格雷很明白自己已经上了钩。他盯着安德鲁舅舅，张大了嘴巴，说不出一句话来，脸色早就刷白了。

“我希望，”安德鲁舅舅这时提高了嗓门，摆出一副做舅舅的样子，好像慷慨地赐予了别人一大笔赏钱或给了对方善意的忠告似的，他斩钉截铁地说，“我希望，迪格雷，你不甘示弱。想到我们家竟没有人有足够的正义与侠气去解救——呃——一位身陷绝境的小姐，我真感到遗憾。”

“呸，闭嘴！”迪格雷说道。“你要是还有点正义感或什么的话，你就自己去了。但我知道你是不会去的。好吧，我看我是不得不去了。但你真是个狼心狗肺的家伙。我想你是早有预谋，让她稀里糊涂去了，然后我又不得不跟着一起去。”

“当然，”安德鲁舅舅一脸的奸笑。

“好吧，我去。但有件事我得先说明白，我到今天才相信魔法，现在我确信真有这么回事儿。这样的话，我想所有古老的神话故事或多或少是真的。而你就是故事里那种又邪恶又残忍的魔法师。等着瞧，这样的人最后不遭报应的故事我还从没读到过。我打赌，总会轮到你的。活该。”

迪格雷说了那么多，这番话才真正触到他的痛处。安德鲁舅舅吃了一惊，他虽然禽兽不如，但脸上笼罩的恐惧神色，几乎让你对他产生怜悯。可不一会儿，他就恢复了往日的神气，带着相当勉强的笑容，说：“好吧，好吧，我看像你这么个在妇人堆里长大的孩子，这么想也很自然。那些都是老太太们的瞎话，不是吗？我想你不必为我担忧，迪格雷。为你小伙伴的安危担忧不是更好吗？她去了有一会儿了，要是那边有什么危险——唉，迟去一秒就要遗憾终生啊。”

“蒙您关心，”迪格雷狠狠地说，“别让我为你的废话恶心了。要我怎么做？”

“你实在该学学怎样管好你的脾气，我的孩子，”安德鲁舅舅冷冷地说，“不然，你长大了就跟你的蕾蒂姨妈一个样子。好，听我说。”

他起身戴上一副手套，朝着装有戒指的托盘走去。

“它们要碰到你的皮肤才会起作用，”他说，“我戴着手套去取——像这样——就没事儿。如果你装一枚在口袋里，会很安全的，但你一定得留意别把手伸进口袋，以免不小心碰到它。一碰到黄戒指，你就从这个世界消失了。当你到了另一个世界，我想——这当然还没进行过实验，但我想——你一旦碰了绿戒指，就会从那个世界消失——我想——你又会回到这个世界来的。看好，我把这两枚绿色的戒指放进你右手边的口袋。牢牢记住哪个口袋里装着绿戒指。G代表‘绿色’，R代表‘右边’。你明白的，G和R正好是‘绿色(green)’一词的头两个字母。你拿着一枚，另一枚给那个小女孩儿。现在，给自己拿上一枚黄戒指吧。换了我，我就把它套在指头上，这样不容易丢。”

迪格雷正要伸手去拿那枚黄戒指，又突然停住了。

“且慢，”他说，“要是我妈问我去哪里了，怎么向她交代呢？”

“快去就能快回，”安德鲁舅舅得意地说。

“可你其实也不能肯定我是不是还能回来。”

安德鲁舅舅耸了耸肩，穿过屋子走到门前，一把推开门，说道：

“噢，好吧，请便。下楼吃饭吧。你要是乐意，就让那小女孩儿留在那个世界里，成为野兽的盘中餐，要不就淹死、饿死，或永远留在那儿吧。对我来说没什么区别。也许，你最好赶在下午茶之前去拜访一下普卢默夫人，告诉她再也见不到她女儿了；就因为你不敢戴上一枚戒指。”

“老天在上，”迪格雷说道，“我真希望有足够的力气一拳捶扁你的脑袋。”

于是，他扣上了外套，深深吸了一口气，拿起了戒指。那一刻他觉得，正如事后也常常这么认为，这可算是他一辈子最高尚的一次举动了。





第三章　各个世界间的树林


刹那间，安德鲁舅舅和他的书房消失了。紧接着，周围的事物突然变得昏暗而模糊。后来，迪格雷感到有一束柔和的绿光从上面向他射来，而下面则是一片黑暗。他既不像是坐着，也不像是躺着，似乎是凌空站着。四周空无一物。“我相信自己是在水里，”迪格雷说，“要不就是在水底。”这使他惊了一下，但他立刻觉得自己在往上冲。紧接着，他的脑袋突然探了出来接触到了空气，他发现自己正爬上岸，爬到了水潭边平坦而又茂盛的草地上。

站起来时，他注意到自己既没有浑身湿漉漉的，也没有上气不接下气，一点儿都不像刚从水里出来的样子。他的衣服完全是干的。他正站在树林中的一个小小的水潭边——水潭还不足十英尺宽。树木一棵紧挨着一颗耸立着，枝繁叶茂，让他都望不见天空。阳光只能透过树叶洒下来，都成了绿光；然而，树林上方一定是烈日当空，因为那绿光是如此明亮而温暖。那简直是你所能想象的最宁静的树林了。没有鸟兽与昆虫，就连一丝儿风也没有。你几乎能感觉到树木在生长。他刚刚钻出来的那个水潭并不是树林里唯一的一个，周围还散落着十几个这样的水潭呢——放眼望去，每隔几米就有一个。你几乎可以感觉到那些树木用它们的根在喝水。这个树林生机勃勃。后来每回迪格雷试图描述它时，他总是说：“那真是个绿油油的地方：油得像块葡萄干饼。”

最奇怪的是，还没等打量一下四周，迪格雷就已差不多忘记他是怎么来到这里的了。他怎么也想不起波莉、安德鲁舅舅，甚至他的妈妈。他丝毫没有恐惧，一点儿都不激动，也不感到惊奇。要是有人问他：“你从哪里来呀？”他很可能会回答说：“我一直就在这里啊。”就是这种感觉——好像你一直就待在那里，虽然什么事情也没发生，你却从不感到厌烦。正如他很久以后说的：“那是个啥事儿也不会发生的地方。只有树木在不停生长，仅此而已。”

迪格雷在那片树林里东张西望了好一会儿，便注意到离他几米远的一棵树下，有位女孩儿仰天躺着，双眼微合，似睡非睡的模样。他默默地盯着她看了好久。最后，她睁开了眼睛，也默默地盯着他看了好一会儿。后来，她开口了，声音轻柔而安详：

“我觉得以前在哪儿见过你，”她说。

“我也有这种感觉，”迪格雷说。“你待在这儿很久了吗？”

“对啊，我一直在这儿，”女孩说，“至少——我也不知道——很长时间了吧。”

“我也是，”迪格雷说。

“不对呀，”她说，“我刚刚见你从那个水潭里出来的。”

“对的，我想是的，”迪格雷一脸的迷惑，说，“我刚才忘了呢。”

然后，两人沉默了好久。

“嘿，”女孩开口了，“我真纳闷儿，我们以前是不是见过？我有种印象——脑子里有一幅图画——一个男孩和一个女孩，就像咱俩——住在另一个跟这儿很不一样的地方——干着各种各样的事情。也许这只是个梦吧。”

“我觉得，我也做过同样的梦，”迪格雷说，“梦见一个男孩和一个女孩，她就住在隔壁——梦见好像在椽子间爬呀爬的。我记得那女孩的脸脏兮兮的。”

“弄反了吧？在我的梦里，男孩的脸才脏兮兮的。”

“我记不得那男孩长啥样了，”迪格雷说，接着又大叫起来，“嘿！那是什么？”

“哇！一只豚鼠，”女孩应道。那是一只胖胖的豚鼠，在草地上嗅来嗅去的。豚鼠的腰间绑着一根带子，带子上系着一枚金晃晃的戒指。

“看呀！快看！”迪格雷大叫起来，“戒指！瞧！你手上戴着一枚呢，我也戴着一枚。”

这事儿终于引起了那女孩的兴趣，她坐了起来。两人紧紧盯着对方，试图回忆起什么。过了会儿，几乎在同时，她喊了出来：

“凯特利先生。”他也喊道：“安德鲁舅舅。”两人终于都搞清楚自己是谁了，并开始回想事情的整个经过。艰难地谈了几分钟后，他俩完全清醒了。迪格雷一五一十地讲述了安德鲁舅舅如何像畜生一样冷血。

“现在我们该怎么办？”波莉问，“带上豚鼠一块儿回去吗？”

“不着急，”迪格雷打了个长长的哈欠。

“怎么能不急，”波莉说，“这地方太安静了，简直像——像在梦里，你总觉得昏昏欲睡。一旦我们撑不住，躺下来，就这么永远地睡过去了。”

“真是个好地方啊，”迪格雷说。

“不错，是个好地方，”波莉说，“但我们还是得回去。”她站起身来，小心翼翼朝豚鼠走了过去，可不一会儿又改变了主意。

“我们还是把这只豚鼠留在这里吧，”她说。“它在这里多快活呀，要是我们带它回去的话，你那安德鲁舅舅只会对它下毒手。”

“我打赌他干得出，”迪格雷说，“看看他是怎样对待咱俩的！对了，我们该怎么回去？”

“我看，回到水潭里就行了。”

他们走了过去，肩并肩站在水潭边，注视着平静的水面。碧波中满是苍翠而又茂密的枝叶的倒影，使碧潭显得异常深邃。

“我们没有游泳衣，”波莉说。

“不需要，傻瓜，”迪格雷说，“我们是穿着衣服下水的，可你忘了我们上来时衣服却没湿吗？”

“你会游泳吗？”

“会一点儿，你呢？”

“会游——但游得不好。”

“我看我们不需要游泳，”迪格雷说，“我们只需要往下沉，不是吗？”

他俩谁也不喜欢跳水潭这个馊主意，但谁也没告诉对方。他俩手拉手，接着喊“一、二、三，跳！”便跳了进去。扑通一声，他俩自然都闭紧了双眼。然而，等睁开眼睛，却发现仍旧手拉手站在那片绿树林里，水还没淹过他们的脚踝呢。很显然，水潭只有几英寸深。他俩又蹚着水回到了岸上。

“到底怎么回事？”波莉慌张地说，但还不至于像你想象的那样受惊，因为，在那片林子里谁都不容易真正担惊受怕。那儿实在是太安静了。

“哦！我明白了，”迪格雷说，“这当然不行了，我们还戴着黄戒指呢。要知道，它们只负责出去，绿色的才能带你返回。我们必须换戒指。你有口袋吗？很好，把黄戒指放在左边的口袋里。我有两枚绿戒指，这枚给你。”

他们戴上了绿戒指，又回到水潭边。但还没等再次跳进去，迪格雷拖长嗓门“噢——！”地大叫了一声。

“怎么了？”波莉问。

“我有一个绝妙的主意，”迪格雷答道。“不知其他水潭里有些什么？”

“什么意思？”

“咦，要是我们跳进这个水潭就能回去，那么，跳进另一个水潭不就能去另外一个地方了吗？想想，每个潭底都有一个世界啊。”

“但我看我们已经到了你安德鲁舅舅说的‘另外的世界’或‘另一片土地’，管它叫什么呢。你不是说——”

“唉，该死的安德鲁舅舅，”迪格雷打断她，“我不信他什么都搞明白了。他自己绝不敢来。他只说有一个‘另外的世界’，谁知道是不是有好多个呢！”

“你是说，这片树林可能只是其中之一？”

“不，我觉得这片树林根本就不是一个世界。依我看，它只不过是某个中间地带。”

波莉听得懵了。

“你还不明白？”迪格雷说，“不明白那就听我讲。想想家里屋顶石板后的隧道吧，它不是任何一幢房子的一个房间，可以说，它其实不属于哪幢房子。可是，只要你钻入隧道，就能沿着它走通那一整排的房子，进入任何一幢。这片树林不也一样吗？——一个不属于任何世界的地方，但只要你找到了这个地方，就可以通过它进入所有的世界。”

“好吧，就算你能——”波莉刚开口，可迪格雷就像没听见似的继续说：

“这下什么都解释清楚啦，”他说，“怪不得这里安静得让人昏昏欲睡。这里啥事儿都没有发生过。就像在家里，聊天啊，做事啊，吃饭啊，都是在屋子里进行的，而中间地带啊，墙后啊，天花板上啊，地板底下啊，或者在我们的隧道里啊，啥事儿都不会发生。但是，你要是从隧道里出来，就会发现自己在某所房子里。我想，我们从这里出发，想去啥好地方都行！我们不必跳回我们上来的那个水潭。现在还不是时候。”

“各个世界间的树林，”波莉像在说梦话，“听起来真不错。”

“来吧，”迪格雷说，“先试试哪个水潭？”

“等等，”波莉说，“先确定我们是不是可以从原先的水潭回去，再跳另一个水潭也不迟啊。我们还不敢肯定这是不是管用呢。”

“好吧，”迪格雷说，“然后让安德鲁舅舅一把逮住，没收了戒指，结果啥乐子都没找着。真是自讨没趣。”

“我们难道不可以跳回我们上来的那个水潭，但只走一截路吗？”波莉说。“就看看绿戒指是不是管用。要是管用，没等回到凯特利先生的书房，我们就把戒指换回来，还在这里上岸。”

“能跳下去只走一截路？”

“嗯，上这儿来花了点时间，我想回去也要一会儿的。”

迪格雷争执了好一会儿，但最后只得同意了，因为弄不清能否回到老地方，波莉便拒绝去新世界做任何探险。面对危险（比如危险人物），波莉和他一样勇敢，但她对于探索闻所未闻的事物可没什么兴趣。由于迪格雷是那种想了解一切的人，因此长大以后，他就成了这个系列故事另外几本书里有名的柯克教授。

经过好一番争执，他俩都同意戴上绿戒指（“绿色象征安全，”迪格雷说，“这样，你就自然而然记住什么颜色派什么用了。”），然后准备手拉手跳下去。但是，在眼看着快回到安德鲁舅舅的书房，或返回自己的世界时，波莉会大喊一声“换”。这时，他们就脱掉绿戒指，戴上黄的。迪格雷想要发“换”这一指令，但波莉不同意。

他俩戴上了绿戒指，手拉着手，再次喊道：“一、二、三，跳！”这次成功了。很难告诉你当时究竟是种什么感觉，因为一切发生得太快。一开始，有明亮的灯光在黑漆漆的天空里移动；迪格雷总以为那是星星，甚至发誓他都看见木星了——离得那么近，近到都看见了它的卫星。然而，四周立即出现了一排又一排的屋顶和烟囱的管帽，紧接着，他们看见了圣保罗大教堂，这时他们知道眼前已经是伦敦了。不过，你却能够透过墙壁，一直看到房子里面。后来，他们看见了安德鲁舅舅，他的身影起先模模糊糊、飘忽不定，但越变越清晰，越变越固定，似乎直逼视野的中心而来。但还没等这个身影完全呈现，波莉大喊一声“换”，他们换了戒指，于是，我们这个世界便像梦一般退去了，他们头顶上方的绿光越来越强。最后，他们从水潭中探出了脑袋，爬上了岸，围绕着他们的依旧是那片树林，还像以前那般碧绿苍翠。整个事情从头到尾才用了不到一分钟。

“真棒！”迪格雷说。“行了，现在该探险了。哪个水潭都行，来吧，就那个。”

“等等！”波莉说。“我们不在这个水潭边做上个记号吗？”

他们面面相觑。一意识到迪格雷差点儿犯了一个可怕的错误，两人脸都吓白了。由于林子里有许许多多这样的水潭，看上去都差不多，周围的树木也没啥区别，因此，要是他们不做标记就从通往我们世界的水潭离开，那么，再找回来的可能性就微乎其微了。

迪格雷的手颤抖着打开削笔刀，在水潭边割下一块长长的草皮。泥土（正散发着清香）呈很深的红褐色，在绿草地的映衬下十分显眼。“幸亏我们中间还有一个人有头脑，”波莉说。

“行了，别得意啦，”迪格雷说。“来吧，我想看看其他水潭里有些什么。”波莉听后尖刻地挖苦起来，迪格雷则回敬了几句更难听的话。争吵持续了好一会儿，但这些写下来没什么意思，我们还是略过吧。接下来要写的是，他们戴上了黄戒指，站在一个不知名的水潭边上，心怦怦直跳，神色恐慌，手拉着手，再次喊道：“一、二、三，跳！”

扑通一声！还是不管用。看来，这个水潭也只不过是个普通水坑。那天早上，他们没能到达新的世界不说，还又一次弄湿了双脚，腿上也溅了水（就算那是个早晨吧：各个世界间的树林里似乎没有时间的变化）。

“该死的，真烦人！”迪格雷嚷道。“这回又是哪儿不对劲？我们好端端戴着黄戒指呢，他明明说黄的是管出去的。”

其实，安德鲁舅舅对世界间的树林一无所知，对戒指的认识也是错误的。黄戒指并不管“出去”，绿戒指也不管“返回”；至少，不是像他理解的那样。两种戒指的材料都取自这片树林，黄戒指的材料有一种把你拉回树林的力量，这是材料本身想回归本土，回归那片中间地带。而绿戒指的材料则会把你带离它的本土：因此绿戒指就能带你离开这片树林，进入某个世界。你看，安德鲁舅舅正在干的事儿连他自己都没全弄明白；大部分魔法师都这样。当然，迪格雷也没完全搞明白真相，他是后来才弄清楚的。这次，经过一番讨论，他们决定戴上绿戒指，选个新水潭再试一次，看看究竟会发生什么。

“你要有胆，我就奉陪，”波莉说。她之所以敢这么说，是因为这次她打心眼里相信，在这个新水潭里两种戒指都不管用，除了再溅一身水，没什么更可怕的了。我不确定迪格雷是不是也这么想。不管怎样，他俩戴上了绿戒指，回到了岸边，依旧手拉手站好。这一回，他们可比上回欢快多啦，全无上回那样的严肃。

“一、二、三，跳！”迪格雷说罢，他们就跳了下去。





第四章　钟与锤


这回，魔法毫无疑问地起作用了。他们一直沉下去，沉下去，起先穿过一片黑暗，接着穿过一团不可名状的模糊且呈旋涡状的东西。眼前慢慢亮了起来，突然，他们感到双脚踏上了某种坚实的东西。过了一会儿，能定睛看清楚一些东西了，也能朝四下里张望了。

“好个诡异的地方！”迪格雷说。

“我不喜欢这里，”波莉哆哆嗦嗦地说。

他们最先注意到的是光线，既不像太阳光，也不像电灯、煤油灯、蜡烛或他们见到过的任何一种光。那是一种死气沉沉的、红惨惨的光，让人看了心里不爽。光线是稳定的，一闪也不闪。他们站在一块铺设过的平地上，被四周高耸的建筑包围着。头顶上方没有屋顶，显然他们站着的地方是个院子。天空出奇的昏暗——蓝得发黑。你要是看到这样的天空，准会诧异，这里居然会有光。

“这儿的天气真怪，”迪格雷说。“我看我们是不是正巧赶上一场暴风雨，或一次日食。”

“我不喜欢这里，”波莉说。

不知怎么的，两人都轻声轻气地说话。虽然跳下水后就没有理由一直拉着手，但他们一直不肯松开。

院子四周的围墙高高耸立着，墙上嵌有许许多多巨大的窗户，窗户没安玻璃，望进去，里面漆黑一片。稍往下，有几扇支着柱子的巨大拱门，像火车隧道那样打哈欠似的张着黑洞洞的大口。天气冷极了。

建造所有这些建筑的石头看上去红通通的，但这可能只是受那种奇怪的光照射的缘故。这些石头显然已相当古老了。院中铺地的石板多处都裂了缝，没有一块石板与另一块接得严丝合缝，它们的棱角都磨平了。有一扇拱门让碎石堵了一半。两个孩子不停地把身子转过来转过去，朝院子四周东张西望，生怕有什么人——或什么东西——趁他们背过身时从窗户里窥探他们。

“你想这儿会有人住吗？”迪格雷终于开口说话，但仍然压低了声音。

“没有吧，”波莉说，“这地方只是堆废墟。打我们来这儿起，还没听到一丁点儿动静。”

“站好了别动，我们再来听听，”迪格雷建议道。

他们一动不动站在那里，静静地听，但除了自己心脏的怦怦跳动声，什么也没有听到。这个地方至少安静得像世界间的树林。不过，这是另一种安静。那片树林的安静是葱翠、温暖而又生机勃勃的（你几乎可以听见树木在生长）；而这里则是种死寂、冰冷而又空空荡荡的安静，你无法想象会有什么生命在这儿生长。

“我们回家吧，”波莉央求着说。

“可我们什么都没发现呢，”迪格雷说。“既然来了，就得四处看看。”

“我敢肯定，这儿没啥好玩的。”

“来都来了，却怕得要死不敢看看，那么，找一枚魔戒把你带到其他世界里去又有什么意义呢？”

“谁说怕得要死啦？”波莉说着，甩开了迪格雷的手。

“我就觉得你好像对探索这个地方没啥热情。”

“随你去哪儿，我都跟着。”

“我们想离开时就能离开，”迪格雷说。“让我们把绿戒指取下来，放进右边口袋。你要做的，只是记住左边口袋里装的是黄戒指。你可以把手放在离口袋尽可能近的地方，但千万不要伸进去，不然，一碰黄戒指，你就消失了。”

准备好以后，他俩静悄悄地朝着一扇巨大的拱门走去，这是通向建筑内部的拱门之一。他们站在门槛上，朝里望去，发现里面并非他们原先想象的那样漆黑一片。拱门通向一个昏暗的大厅，看起来空荡荡的；而在大厅远处的一端有一排柱子支着拱门，从拱门里透进更多同样微弱的光线。他们穿过大厅，脚步小心翼翼的，唯恐地上有洞或横着什么东西将他们绊倒。他们似乎走了很长一段路。当他们走到大厅另一端，钻过拱门时，却发现自己来到了另一个更大的院子里。

“这儿好像不太安全，”波莉指着一处地方说，那儿有一面墙鼓了出来，好像随时要倒向院中。有两扇拱门之间缺了一根柱子，原本垂下来与柱顶相接的那丁点儿残迹，毫无支撑地悬在半空。那地方显然已荒芜了几百甚至上千年了。

“既然保留到了今天，我想它还会继续保留下去的，”迪格雷说，“但我们千万别弄出啥声响。你知道，有时一丁点儿动静就会使东西塌下来——就像阿尔卑斯山的雪崩一样。”

他们又往前走去，出了那个院子，进了另一扇门，接着，登上了一大段台阶，又穿过一个接一个的大房间，那地方大得简直把你搞得头晕目眩。每次他们都觉得，这回可要重见天日了，可以看看这个巨大的宫殿之外究竟是个什么样的国度了；然而，他们每次都只闯进了另一个院子而已。人丁兴旺时，这地方一定宏伟气派。有一处地方曾经是一座喷泉，一个巨大的石兽展翅屹立，兽嘴大张，望进去，在很里面还能看见喷水管道的残迹。石兽下面有一个用来接水的宽宽的石盆，但已经干涸得像白骨一般了。还有些地方，有某种攀缘植物的枯藤，它们曾缠着石柱生长，有几根柱子都被它们拽塌了。不过，这种植物已死了很久了。至于蚂蚁、蜘蛛，这里是没有的，也没有你在废墟中常见到的其他生物。碎裂的石板间露出干燥的泥土，上面既不长草，也不长青苔。

这地方阴森森的，各处千篇一律，迪格雷禁不住盘算起来，打算戴上黄戒指，回到中间地带那片温暖、葱翠、生机勃勃的林子里去。这时候，他们来到了两扇似乎是金铸的巨门前。有一扇门半开着，他们自然要进去看个究竟。这一看，不禁让他们倒吸一口凉气，吓得退了回来：终于遇到一处值得一看的地方了！

一眼望去，他们还以为屋子里满是人呢——足有好几百人，全都一动不动地端坐着。你猜得到，波莉和迪格雷也一动不动地站了很久，朝里面张望着。可他们很快就断定，眼前这些不大会是真人。他们既没有动静，也没有气息，真像是你见过的最精美的蜡像。

这一回，波莉打了头阵。她对这屋子里有些东西的兴趣，可比迪格雷大多啦。所有塑像都衣着华丽，如果你对服饰感兴趣，肯定会忍不住走近去细瞧。相比其他地方的空荡荡、灰扑扑，这些服饰的光泽，虽不能说使这间屋子多么赏心悦目，但无论如何，也使之满室生辉了。这间屋子的窗户也更多，因此也更为明亮。

要描绘这些服饰可真的太难啦。那些塑像个个身披长袍，头戴皇冠。深红、银灰、暗紫、鲜绿的长袍上绣满了花卉、怪兽或其他各式各样的花纹。皇冠上嵌的，胸前挂的，都是巨大而耀眼的宝石，他们浑身上下的装饰，无不显得珠光宝气。

“这些衣服这么久了怎么还没腐烂？”波莉问。

“施了魔法呗，”迪格雷低声说。“你感觉不到吗？我敢打赌，这整间屋子都让魔法给定住了。一进来我就感觉到了。”

“随便哪件衣服都值几百英镑啊，”波莉说。

可迪格雷更感兴趣的是那几张面孔，它们的确有一番看头呢。那些人端坐在屋子四周的石椅上，屋子中央是空的，你可以走过去，逐个端详那些面孔。

“这些人长得多好看啊，”迪格雷说。

波莉点点头。他们看见的面孔都长得非常好看，男男女女看起来既善良又聪明，可能是某个长相俊美的种族的后代吧。可是，等到孩子们朝屋子里面又走了几步时，看见的脸庞就有些不同了。这些面孔神情严肃，让你觉得，要是在现实生活中遇到这样的人，可得小心伺候着。他们又往前走了几步，大约走到了屋子的中央，这里的面孔看上去强悍、高傲、陶醉，却又冷酷无情，不是他们喜欢的神情。越往前走，脸越显得冷酷。再往前，脸依旧冷酷，但已看不到陶醉的神情了，甚至充满了绝望：似乎这些塑像的原身曾做过什么可怕的事情，有过什么可怕的遭遇似的。最后一尊塑像最有意思——是一位衣着更为华丽的女人，体格魁梧（那间屋子里每一尊塑像都比我们世界的普通人魁梧），她脸上露出的残忍与傲慢的神情，使你见了大气都不敢出一声。不过，她同样非常漂亮。过了许多年，等迪格雷老了的时候，他还会说这是他这辈子见过的最美丽的女人。为公平起见，我们不得不再补充一句，波莉总是说，她看不出这女人有哪个地方特别漂亮。

这个女人，我刚才说了，是最末一个；而她身后还放着许多把空椅子，想必这间屋子原打算容纳更多的塑像。

“我真希望咱们能知道这背后的故事，”迪格雷说，“我们回去看看屋子中间那个像桌子一样的东西吧。”

屋子中央那个东西并不是一张桌子，而是一个四英尺高的方柱，上面隆起了一个小小的金拱门，门上挂着一只小金钟，钟旁放着一把小金锤，是用来敲钟的。

“嗯……我想……嗯……”迪格雷嘀咕着。

“那儿好像写着些什么，”波莉说着弯下腰去，注视着柱子的侧面。

“好家伙！就在那儿，”迪格雷说，“可是，我们甭想读懂的。”

“读不懂？我看难说，”波莉说。

他俩读得很起劲，你可能猜到了，石头上刻着的是一种奇怪的字母。而恰在此时，不可思议的怪事儿发生了：虽然奇怪的字母并未变形，但他们看着看着，却发现自己能读懂了。要是迪格雷记得几分钟前他还说过，这屋子被施了魔法，他就早该想到是魔法起作用了。可是他心中满是好奇，压根儿没想到这个。他越来越渴望知道柱子上究竟写了些什么。很快，他俩都读懂了。上面大概写了这么些东西——至少大意如此，你要是亲自去读原诗，意思会更清楚：

快选择吧，爱冒险的旅人；

钟一敲响，就将惹火上身，

或者痴想，会有什么后果，

最后把自己弄得走火入魔。

“千万不要，”波莉说，“我们别去惹火上身。”

“唉，没用的，你没看出来吗？”迪格雷说。“我们跑不掉啦。我们会一直想下去，想敲了钟究竟有什么后果。我可不愿意想得走火入魔。千万不要！”

“别傻了，”波莉说，“好像谁愿意似的！它要发生就让它发生，有啥大不了？”

“我看，每个到了这儿的人都会想个不停，最后搞得疯疯癫癫的。你看，这就是它的魔力。我感觉我已经有点儿中魔了。”

“胡说，我没感觉，”波莉不高兴了。“我才不信你真中魔了呢，你是装的吧。”

“你就知道这些，”迪格雷说。“女孩子家的，什么都不想知道，尽关心谁跟谁订婚了，整天扯这些八卦。”

“你说这番话的神气简直跟你舅舅一模一样，”波莉说。

“你为什么就不能谈正经的？”迪格雷说。“咱俩现在的正题是——”

“多像个男子汉啊！”波莉装出大人的口吻说道。接着，她又变回自己的语调匆匆补了一句：“不要说我就像个女人，不然，你就是一只讨厌的学舌鹦鹉。”

“我做梦也没想过把你这样的小鬼叫作女人，”迪格雷傲慢地说。

“噢，我是个小鬼，对吗？”波莉这下可真火了。“好吧，你再也不需要带上个小鬼来拖累你了。我要走了。我受够了这个地方，也受够了你——你这讨厌的、顽固的、自以为是的蠢猪！”

“住手！”迪格雷大吼一声，他本不想发出如此凶恶的声音，可他看见波莉的手正伸向口袋，要去摸那枚黄戒指。迪格雷接下去的举动我是不能为他开脱的，最多只能说，他后来后悔了（许多人都是事后才悔过的）。还没等波莉的手摸到口袋，他一把抓住她的手腕，靠过去，用背抵住她的胸膛，又用另一只手肘挡开她另一条手臂。他探过身去，拾起锤子，在金钟上轻轻一敲。然后，他一松手，两人都跌倒在地上，他俩狠狠盯着对方，喘着粗气。波莉开始哭了，不是因为害怕，也不是因为他把她的手腕扭得很痛，而是因为极大的愤怒。不过，他们很快就把这场风波抛到了九霄云外，因为有别的事情需要他们费心了。

钟一敲响，就发出一种音调，你可能猜到了，是一种悦耳的音调，轻轻柔柔的。钟声回荡着，丝毫没有减弱，并且越来越响。不到一分钟，声音就比起先增大了一倍。又过了一会儿，声音大到连孩子们相互讲话都听不到了（但这时他们并不想讲话—只是张口结舌地站着）。再过了一会儿，声音大得连他们大叫大喊起来都听不见了。然而，声音还在越变越大：从头到尾就一个音调，连绵不绝，虽然听起来十分悠扬，却透出一丝恐怖的气息。随后，整个屋子的空气也随之颤动了起来，两人感觉到连脚下的石板都在颤抖。终于，有另一种模糊而又凄惨的声音混了进来，起初像是远处火车在咆哮，继而又像大树轰的一声坠地。他们听见好像有什么笨重的东西倒了下来。最后，突如其来一阵撞击，轰隆一声，那震动差点儿把他俩抛了出去。只见屋子一端约四分之一的屋顶塌了下来，大块大块的砖石坠落在他们四周，墙壁也在晃动。钟声停息了，尘土消散了，一切又恢复了平静。

真搞不明白是魔法使屋顶倾塌的呢，还是原本就快断裂的墙恰好抵挡不了刺耳的钟声而倾塌的。

“好了！我想这下你满意了吧，”波莉气喘吁吁地说。

“不管怎么说，一切都结束了，”迪格雷说。

两人都这么认为；然而，他俩却犯了一生中最大的一个错误。





第五章　绝命咒


两个孩子隔着挂着金钟的石柱，面面相觑。钟仍在震颤，而钟声已经停歇了。忽然，从屋子尽头还未坍塌的一角，传来一阵轻微的响动。他俩像闪电般迅速地转过身去，想看个究竟。在身披长袍的塑像中，最远的那个，也就是迪格雷觉得异常美丽的那个女人，正从椅子上站起来。等她站直后，他们注意到，她比他们原先想象的可要高多了。从她的皇冠和长袍，还有她的眼神和嘴唇的线条上，你马上能看出，她是一位了不起的女王。她环顾了整个屋子，看见了坍塌的一角，也看见了孩子们，但从她脸上的表情你无法推测她究竟在想什么，也无法看出她是否感到惊讶。她大步流星地走了过来。

“是谁唤醒了我？又是谁解了魔咒？”她问道。

“我想，应该是我吧，”迪格雷回答。

“是你！”女王说着，把一只手搁到了迪格雷的肩上——那只手又白又美，但迪格雷却觉得像铁钳般结实。“你？你只是个孩子，小毛孩一个。谁都能一眼看出，你的血管里没有一滴皇家或贵族的血液。像你这样的人胆敢闯进这间屋子？”

“我们从另一个世界来，靠魔法来的，”波莉说，她认为应趁机让女王像注意迪格雷那样注意她。

“真的吗？”女王问，眼睛仍盯着迪格雷，瞟都不瞟波莉一眼。

“是的，”他回答。

女王伸出另一只手，托起迪格雷的下巴，以便仔细端详他的脸。迪格雷想用目光瞪回去，但很快就垂下了眼，因为她身上有某种东西制服了他。她将迪格雷仔细打量了一分多钟，然后松开他的下巴，说：

“你不是魔法师，你脸上没有标记。你应该只是魔法师的仆人。你是靠别人的魔法才来到这里的。”

“是靠我的安德鲁舅舅，”迪格雷说。

正说着，从屋子近旁，而不是屋子里面，传来了一阵隆隆声，接着又嘎吱嘎吱地响成了一片，过后是一阵砖塌地陷的轰响，地板也跟着颤动了起来。

“大祸临头了，”女王说，“整个宫殿就要倒塌。如果几分钟内我们逃不出去，就会被埋进废墟。”她不慌不忙地说着，好像在谈论一天的时辰。“快，”她又说，并向两个孩子各伸出一只手。波莉绷着个脸，她对这个女王没啥好感，要不是不得已，她才不会让女王抓住自己的手呢。女王虽然说话时不慌不忙，但行动和思维却异常敏捷。还没等波莉反应过来，她的左手就被一只大得多、有劲儿得多的手抓住了，使她根本无法挣脱。

“这女人真可怕，”波莉想，“她太有劲儿了，轻轻一扭就能把我的手臂折断。既然她抓着我的左手，我就摸不到黄戒指了。要是我费了劲儿把右手伸过去摸左边的口袋，还没等摸到戒指，她就得质问我在干什么了。无论发生什么，千万不能让她知道戒指的事儿。我真希望迪格雷能管住他的嘴。我巴不得能亲口叮嘱他一句。”

女王领他们出了塑像厅，进入一条长廊，接着又晕头转向地穿过许多大厅、台阶和院子。那座雄伟的宫殿轰隆隆倒塌的声音不时传来，有时就近在身边。有一次，他们刚刚穿过一扇巨大的拱门，它就轰地塌了下来。女王健步如飞——孩子们不得不一路小跑着才能跟上——但她丝毫没有露出惧怕的神色。迪格雷心想：“她简直太勇猛，太强悍啦，女王真不是白叫的。真想让她给我们讲讲这里的故事啊。”

她一路走着，也确实一路上给他们讲了好些事情。

她告诉他们：“那扇门通向地牢。”或者：“那条过道通往主行刑室。”或者：“这是当年的宴会厅，我的曾祖父曾在这里设宴款待过七百位贵族，没等他们酒酣，就将他们赶尽杀绝了。他们想谋反。”

最后，他们来到一个比先前见到的所有房间都要高大宽敞的大厅，从它的规模和远处一端的几扇大门判断，迪格雷认为他们终于来到了主入口。这回他猜对了。大门黑漆漆的，不是用乌木，就是用一种我们的世界所没有的黑色金属做的。这些大门都上着巨大的门闩，大多数门闩又高又沉，让你够不着也抬不动。他很纳闷他们该怎么出去。

女王松开了他的手，举起自己的一只手臂，尽力耸直身子，直挺挺地站在那里。接着，她说了些他们听不懂的话（但听起来很恐怖），又朝大门做了一个扔东西的动作。这时，那些笨重的巨门抖了几下，像是丝织品做的，立刻塌了下来，除了门槛上留下一堆土灰，什么也不剩了。

“唷！”迪格雷从嘴里嘘出一声惊叫。

“你的魔法师主人，你舅舅，有我这种法力吗？”女王说着，又紧紧抓住了迪格雷的手。“我会弄明白的。同时，我要你们记住刚才看见的。不论是人是物，挡我者必是此下场。”

现在，门敞开着，有更多光线射了进来，他们从未在这个国家见过如此充足的光线。女王带他们穿过门洞，他们一点儿都不奇怪自己竟然置身于光天化日之下了。刮在他们脸上的风冷飕飕的，带着股腐臭的味道。他们站在一块高地上远眺，脚下壮丽的景色一览无遗。

往下看去，一轮巨大的红日贴着地平线，看起来比我们的太阳大得多。迪格雷立刻就感到它比我们的太阳要年迈：几近垂暮的太阳，已厌倦了俯瞰下面的世界。太阳的左上方，悬着一颗孤星，又大又亮。黑暗的天空中，唯有残阳与孤星凄凄凉凉地相伴着。大地上，铺展着一个极目四望不见边际的巨大城市，城市里看不到一个活物。所有的庙宇、高塔、宫殿、金字塔和桥梁，在残阳下投下长长的凄惨的影子。曾几何时，有一条大河流经城里，但如今早已干涸，只留下一条宽宽的灰土沟。

“好好看看吧，以后永远都看不到了，”女王说。“这就是恰恩，曾经伟大的城市，王中王之城，它是这个世界，也许是所有世界的奇迹。孩子，你舅舅也统治着这样一个伟大的城市吗？”

“没有，”迪格雷说。他本想解释说安德鲁舅舅并没有统治哪个城市，但女王紧接着说：

“现在多安静啊。当年我站在这里时，空气中充斥着恰恩城的喧嚣：嗒嗒的脚步声，嘎吱嘎吱的车轮声，啪啪的鞭子抽打声，还有奴隶的呻吟和战车的隆隆声，以及寺庙里献祭的咚咚鼓声。当战争的号角吹响，街头巷尾杀声四起，鲜血染红了恰恩河水之时，我也曾站在这里（但那时一切都快了结了）。”她停了一下，接着说：“一个女人，顷刻间便将这一切化为了乌有。”

“谁？”迪格雷嘀咕着问，但心里已有了答案。

“我，”女王回答说，“我，简蒂丝，最后的女王，然而却是世界之王。”

两个孩子静静地站着，在寒风中瑟瑟发抖。

“都怪我姐姐，”女王说，“我是被她逼的。让诸神的毒咒永远降临她吧！只要她当时把王位让给我，我随时准备跟她讲和——是的，而且饶她一命。但她不干。她的傲慢毁灭了整个世界。即使开战后，我们双方也都郑重约定不再使用魔法。可是她不守信用，那我有什么办法？蠢货！她好像不知道我比她法力强大似的！她其实还知道我掌握着绝命咒的秘密。她难道以为——她从头到尾就是个弱者——以为我不会使用吗？”

“什么是绝命咒？”迪格雷问。

“那可是个惊天大秘密，”简蒂丝女王说。“我们这个民族的伟大国王们早就知晓，有一条秘咒，一经恰当的仪式说出，那么除了施咒者本人，所有的生命都将灭绝。可是，古代的国王们太懦弱，心肠太慈悲了，于是就约束自己与后人，起誓对那秘咒的知识决不问津。然而，我在一个秘密的地方偷偷学到了这个秘咒，也因此付出了惨痛的代价。是她逼得我走投无路我才出此下策的。为了征服她，我用尽了一切手段。我不惜我的将士们血流成河……”

“畜生！”波莉咕哝了一句。

“最后一次大战，”女王说道，“在恰恩城的这个位置整整打了三天。那三天，我就站在这儿俯瞰着那场激战。我一直没有施展魔法，直到我的最后一批战士倒了下去。那个女魔头，也就是我姐姐，率领着她的叛军，已经冲到了从城市通向这个高地的台阶的中央。我等候着，她逼近我，近到了能看清对方的脸庞。她那双邪恶的眼睛直盯着我，闪着凶恶的光芒，说：‘胜利了。’‘是的，’我说，‘胜利了，但不是你胜利了。’接着，我说出了那绝命咒。顷刻间，我就是天底下唯一的活物了。”

“可是，那些人呢？”迪格雷喘着粗气问。

“什么人，孩子？”女王问。

“那些平民百姓，”波莉说，“他们又没有伤害你。妇女，孩子，还有动物。”

“你怎么还不明白？”女王说（仍对着迪格雷）。“我是女王，他们都是我的臣民，除了服从我的意志，他们还能怎样？”

“不管怎么说，他们真是倒了大霉，”迪格雷说。

“我差点儿忘了，你不过是个小毛孩，你怎么会明白治国的谋略呢？你要懂得，孩子，对你或对其他凡夫俗子来说是错误的事，对我这样伟大的女王来说就不称其为错。天下的重担压在我们肩上，我们必须挣脱一切法则的束缚。我们是命定高贵而孤独的。”

迪格雷突然想起来，安德鲁舅舅也说过一模一样的话。但这些话出自简蒂丝女王之口，便显得更高贵与威严；可能是因为安德鲁舅舅身高不足七英尺，也没有迷人的外表吧。

“你接着干了些什么呢？”迪格雷问。

“我事先对存放我祖先塑像的厅堂施了强大的魔咒。这魔咒能使我自己也变成他们中的一尊塑像，沉睡千年，不吃饭，不烤火，直到有一个人到来，敲响钟，将我唤醒。”

“绝命咒也使太阳成了现在这副样子？”迪格雷问。

“什么样子？”。

“又大，又红，又冷。”

“一直就这样，”简蒂丝说，“至少，有好几千年了。你们世界的太阳难道不一样吗？”

“是的，要小一些，黄一些，可散发出的热量要多得多。”

“啊——!”女王长叹了一声。迪格雷从她脸上看到了不久前从安德鲁舅舅的脸上看到过的那种饥渴、贪婪的神情。“那么，”她说，“你们的世界要年轻一些。”

她停了停，再次俯瞰着那座破败的城市——就算她对自己犯下的罪有所内疚，也丝毫没有表露——她接着说：

“走，我们要出发了。这儿是末日，太阴冷了。”

“出发去哪儿？”两个孩子一起问。

“出发去哪儿？”简蒂丝重复道，十分诧异，“当然是去你们的世界。”

波莉和迪格雷面面相觑，都吓呆了。波莉一开始就对女王没啥好感；而迪格雷呢，在听完那段故事后，觉得已经看透她了，也不想再了解她什么。显然，没有谁愿意把她这种人带回家。即使想带，也不知道怎样才能带她回家。他俩正盘算着如何溜之大吉再说；可是波莉摸不到戒指，迪格雷自然也不能丢下她不管。他面红耳赤，结结巴巴地说：

“噢——噢——我们的世界。我想……想不到你要去那里。”

“你们不是被派到这儿来接我的吗？不然来干什么？”简蒂丝质问。

“我敢肯定，你压根儿喜欢不上我们的世界，”迪格雷说。“那不是她那种人去的地方，对吗，波莉？那儿闷得很，不值得看的，不骗你。”

“让我来统治，就有它好看的了，”女王说。

“啊，不行，”迪格雷说，“那可使不得。你明白的，他们不会允许的。”

女王轻蔑地一笑。“多少伟大的国王，”她说，“都以为能抵抗恰恩王朝，但他们一个个全倒了下去，连名字也被世人遗忘了。傻小子！你觉得，以我的美貌与魔力，要不了一年时间，还不至于使你们整个世界都拜倒在我的脚下吗？准备施魔法吧，立刻带我去你们那儿。”

“这简直太可怕了，”迪格雷对波莉说。

“你是为你舅舅担忧吧，”简蒂丝说。“只要他乖乖地敬重我，我就保住他的小命和王位。我可不是去推翻他的。既然他知道怎么把你们送到这儿来，那他一定是个非常了不起的魔法师。他独霸着整个世界呢，还只是独霸着一方？”

“他在哪儿都没称王称霸，”迪格雷说。

“你撒谎，”女王说，“魔法不是只传给具有皇家血统的人吗？谁听说过有平民百姓成为魔法师的？不管你开不开口，我都能一眼看穿事情的真相。你舅舅是你们世界的伟大国王，也是一位了不起的魔法师。他曾靠魔法，在某个魔镜或魔池里看到了我脸庞的影像。因为爱慕我的美，他施了一种强大的魔咒，把你们的世界掀了个底朝天，使你们穿越了各个世界间的鸿沟，来这里祈求我的垂怜，并把我带回他的身边。回答我：难道不是这么回事吗？”

“我看，不完全是这么回事，”迪格雷说。

“不完全是这么回事，”波莉嚷了起来。“呸！从头到尾就是胡说八道。”

“奴才！”女王大叫一声，怒气冲冲地转向波莉，一把揪住她的头发，一直揪住她的头顶最容易疼痛的部位。而这时，她只能松开孩子们的手了。“机会来了，”迪格雷大喊一声。“快！”波莉跟着喊道。他们赶紧把左手伸进口袋。根本就不用戴上戒指，触到戒指的那一刹，那个可怕的世界便从他们眼前消失得无影无踪了。他们一直向上冲去，头顶上方，一缕温暖的绿光离他们越来越近。





第六章　安德鲁舅舅的麻烦开始了


“松手！松手！”波莉尖叫着。

“我又没碰你，”迪格雷说。

接着，他们的脑袋探出了水潭，又回到了各个世界间的树林，四周阳光明媚，一派宁静。刚经历了那个地方的腐臭与荒芜，这片树林似乎比以前更显得苍翠、温暖和安宁了。我想，要是可以的话，他们倒很乐意又忘了自己是谁，从哪里来的，然后躺下来，在半梦半醒中聆听着树木的生长，那该多快乐呀。然而，这一次却有什么东西使他们异常清醒：因为一爬到草地上，他们就发现那儿不光有他俩，那个女王，或女巫（随你叫她什么吧），也跟着来了，她仍然紧紧揪着波莉的头发。怪不得刚才波莉大喊“松手”呢。

顺便说一句，这也证明了戒指的另一神奇之处，这连安德鲁舅舅自己都没弄清楚，怪不得没有告诉迪格雷。你不需要戴上或亲手触到戒指，只要触到一个碰到戒指的人，你就能从一个世界穿越到另一个世界。这效应很像磁铁；人人都知道，如果用一块磁铁去拾一枚别针，那么挨着这枚别针的其他别针也会被吸起来。

简蒂丝女王一来到这座林子里，整个人都变了。她脸色比以前苍白了不知多少，这使得她的美貌荡然无存。她屈下身来，像是透不过气，那地方的空气似乎让她感到窒息。这会儿，两个孩子一点儿都不怕她了。

“松手！快松开我的头发，”波莉喊叫着。“你想干什么？”

“听着！松开她的头发，快点！”迪格雷命令她。

两人转身与她厮打了起来。她斗不过他们，很快被迫松开了手。她一个趔趄向后跌去，喘着粗气，眼中露出恐惧的神色。

“快，迪格雷！”波莉说。“换戒指，跳进回家的水潭！”

“救命！救命！行行好！”女巫有气无力地喊着，跌跌撞撞地跟在后面。“把我带上吧。你们可不能把我留在这鬼地方，这简直要我的命啊。”

“此乃治国之谋略，”波莉挖苦她，“就像你杀尽你的世界里的那些人一样。快，迪格雷。”他们已经戴上了绿戒指，但迪格雷说：

“唉，讨厌！我们要干什么来着？”他禁不住有点同情女王了。

“喂，别当傻瓜，”波莉说，“她八成是装的。快点儿。”于是，两个孩子都跳进了回家的水潭。“多亏我们做了记号，”波莉想。但是，当他们跳下去时，迪格雷感到他的耳朵被两根巨大而冰冷的手指捏着。他们沉了下去，他们自己那个世界的模糊景象开始显露了，而抓着耳朵的手指也越来越有劲。很显然，女巫正在恢复她的气力。迪格雷挣扎着，踢腾着，可都不管用。不一会儿，他们便出现在安德鲁舅舅的书房里；安德鲁舅舅惊得直瞪着迪格雷从另一世界带回的这个怪物。

真难怪他瞪大了眼。迪格雷和波莉也瞪大了眼。毫无疑问，女巫从虚弱中缓过来啦；你看，她出现在我们的世界里了，和周围的普通事物一比，真让人倒吸一口凉气。在恰恩，她已经够让人吃惊的了；在伦敦，她简直让人恐惧。正是因为，他们到现在才搞清楚她到底有多魁梧。“这哪是人呀，”迪格雷看着她时这么想。他也许想得不错，因为有人说过，恰恩皇族有着巨人的血统。然而，比起她的美貌、残暴和疯狂来，她体形的庞大算不了什么。她看上去比伦敦街头的大多数人要生猛十倍。安德鲁舅舅哈着腰，搓着手，说实话，他害怕极了。他在女巫身边，看上去就像只小虾米或别的什么小动物。而且，正如波莉后来说的，他和女巫的表情还真有几分相似，就是所有邪恶的魔法师都有的那种表情，也就是简蒂丝说她在迪格雷脸上找不到的那种“标记”。看见他俩在一起后倒有个好处，就是你再也用不着害怕安德鲁舅舅了，就如你见过响尾蛇就不再怕蚯蚓，见过疯公牛就不再怕奶牛一样。

“呸！”迪格雷暗自想。“他算什么魔法师！不配。她才够格呢。”

安德鲁舅舅不断地搓着手，鞠着躬。他想套几句近乎，但又口干舌燥说不出话来。他所谓的用戒指搞出的“实验”，结果比他想象的还成功；虽然他搞了很多年魔法，但总是想方设法把危险留给别人，像今天这样的事情还从未发生过。

这时，简蒂丝开口了，声音不大，却有股力量使整个屋子都震颤了起来。

“把我召到这个世界来的魔法师在哪儿？”

“啊——啊——夫人，”安德鲁舅舅喘着粗气说，“我甚感荣幸——欣慰至极——喜出望外——真是有失远迎呀——我——我——”

“魔法师在哪儿？蠢货！”简蒂丝问。

“鄙人——鄙人就是，夫人。还望您多多包涵——呃——这些调皮的孩子对您的冒犯。我向您保证，他们绝非有意——”

“你就是？”女王质问，声音越发可怕了。说着，她一步跨过屋子，揪住安德鲁舅舅的一大把灰发，将他的头往后拽去，迫使他仰头对着自己。接着，她像在恰恩王宫打量迪格雷的脸那样仔细打量起他的脸来。他眨巴着眼睛，舔着嘴唇，紧张得要命。最后，她放开了他，猛一松手，他一个趔趄向后跌去，撞在了墙上。

“我知道了，”她轻蔑地说，“你是魔法师——法力算不得高明的那种。站起来，狗东西，别像跟你的同类说话那样趴在那儿。你是怎么学会魔法的？我敢发誓，你没有皇族血统。”

“好吧——呃——严格说来也许没有，”安德鲁舅舅结结巴巴地说，“没有地地道道的皇族血统。可是啊，夫人，凯特利家族是很古老的，可算是多塞特郡的一个世家了。”

“打住！”女巫说。“我明白你是谁了。你就是一个书不离手、口诀不离口的不中用的小魔法师，你的血液和心脏里都没有真正的魔力。你这类魔法师一千年前就在我们的世界里绝种了。不过现在，我允许你做我的仆人。”

“能为您效劳——我真是荣幸至极——欣喜万分，这全是实话。”

“住嘴！尽扯些废话。听着，这是给你的第一个任务。我看我们是在一个大城市里。立刻去给我弄辆马车，要不飞毯，要不一条训练有素的飞龙，反正你们这儿皇家贵族常用的啥都行。然后带我去能搞到符合我身份的服装、首饰和奴隶的地方。明天，我就要开始征服这个世界了。”

“我——我——我这就去叫一辆出租马车，”安德鲁舅舅喘着气说。

“站住，”他刚走到门口，女巫又喊叫起来，“休想耍滑头。我的眼睛能穿透墙壁，直看到人的心里去。随你走到哪儿都逃不过我的眼睛。你一有违抗的苗头，我就对你施咒，那么你坐上什么，什么就变成烧红的铁；不论你何时躺上床，脚下都会有看不见的冰块。好吧，快去。”

那老家伙像一条夹着尾巴的狗一样出去了。

孩子们这会儿很怕简蒂丝向他们问起树林里发生的事儿，结果她提也没提，后来也没再提起过。我想（迪格雷也是这么想的），她那样的脑袋根本记不住那种宁静的地方，不管你带她去多少次，把她留在那里多久，她仍然什么都不会记得。这会儿，屋里只剩她和孩子们了，可她压根儿没注意到他们，这也正符合她的做派。在恰恩，她根本不去注意波莉（直到最后），因为迪格雷才是她想利用的人。既然现在她有了安德鲁舅舅，便再也不注意迪格雷了。我觉得大多数女巫都这样，她们极端讲究实用，对自己不能加以利用的人和物丝毫没有兴趣。所以，屋子里安静了一阵子。不过，你能看出简蒂丝越来越不耐烦了，因为她就这么在地板上踱过来踱过去的。

不一会儿，她仿佛自言自语地说：“这老傻瓜在搞什么名堂？我真该带根鞭子来。”说着，她大踏步跨出门去追踪安德鲁舅舅去了，都顾不上瞟孩子们一眼。

“嘘——”波莉长长地舒了口气。“我现在得回家了。太晚了，要挨骂了。”

“那就去吧，快去快回，”迪格雷说。“把她弄到这儿来简直太可怕了。我们得想出点对策。”

“这回有你舅舅受的了，”波莉说，“就是他用魔法搞出这个乱子来的。”

“不管怎样，你会回来的，对吗？岂有此理，你可不能把我一个人留在这鬼地方。”

“我从隧道回家，”波莉冷冷地说，“那样最快。你要是想让我回来，是不是最好说声对不起呢？”

“对不起？”迪格雷嚷了起来。“天哪，搞得跟个娘儿们似的！我究竟做错了什么？”

“噢，也没什么，”波莉挖苦说，“只不过在那间蜡像厅像个欺小凌弱的暴徒，差点把我的手腕拧断；只不过像个蠢蛋似的拿起锤就去敲钟；只不过在树林里还没等跳进回家的水潭就转身了，结果让她逮着机会抓住了你。就这些喽。”

“哦，”迪格雷吃惊地说，“好吧，好吧，我向你赔不是啦。蜡像厅里发生的事我实在抱歉。好了，我已经向你赔不是啦。有点气量吧，记得回来。你要是一去不回，我可就掉到一个可怕的坑里啦。”

“我看你准不会有事儿。凯特利先生才会坐上烧红的椅子，床上才会堆满冰，不是吗？”

“我担心的不是这个，”迪格雷说，“我担心的是妈妈。要是那怪物闯进她的房间可怎么办？准会把她吓死不可。”

“噢，我明白了，”波莉换了一种语气说。“好吧，这次行动代号‘和平女神’。我会回来的——要是回得来的话。现在我真的得走了。”她从一扇小门爬了出去，钻进了隧道；椽子间那块黑漆漆的地方几小时前还那么令人激动，让人感到险象环生，这会儿看起来却平平常常，没什么离奇了。

现在，我们得回头讲讲安德鲁舅舅了。他从阁楼上跌跌撞撞跑下去时，那颗可怜的衰老的心怦怦乱跳。他手里拿着块手帕，不时在额头上擦一下。他一走进楼下的卧室，便把自己锁在里面。他做的第一件事就是从大衣柜里摸出一个瓶子和一只酒杯，他老把这些东西藏在那里，不让蕾蒂姨妈找着。他给自己斟了满满一杯气味呛鼻、大人喝的那种东西，一口气吞了个干净。然后，他才长长地舒了一口气。

“妈呀，”他自言自语道，“可把我吓坏了。都这把老骨头了，还倒这种大霉！”

他又倒了一杯，一饮而尽；接着，他开始换衣服了。你从没见过这种装扮，但我还记得清清楚楚。他戴上了一副锃亮的硬高领，这种领子能一直支着你的下巴；又套上一件印花白背心，把金表链露在胸前；他还穿上了出席婚、丧礼时穿的最精致的礼服，并取出了最漂亮的高筒礼帽，把它弄得干干净净。他的梳妆台上有一瓶花（那是蕾蒂姨妈放的），他摘下一朵插在纽扣眼里；又从左边的小抽屉里掏出一块手帕（如今都很难买到这么好看的手帕了），并洒上了几滴香水。他取出系着粗粗的黑绸带的眼镜，架上鼻梁，接着对着镜子欣赏了起来。

你知道，孩子们有孩子们的傻气，而大人们则有大人们的傻气。这会儿，安德鲁舅舅开始犯大人的傻气了。既然女巫不在他这间屋子里，他便很快忘了刚才所受的惊吓，反而对她的美貌想入非非了。他反复自言自语：“好个优雅的妇人，老兄，好个优雅的妇人哪。真是顶呱呱的娘儿们。”他早就忘了是孩子们把那个“顶呱呱的娘儿们”弄到这里来的，反倒觉得是他自己靠魔法把她从未知的世界里招来的。

“安德鲁，我的好小伙儿，”他边照镜子边对自己说，“你都这把年纪了还保养得这么不错。真是一表人才哪，先生。”

你看，这愚蠢的老家伙其实正幻想着女巫会爱上他，这很可能是因为刚刚两杯酒下肚，也可能是因为穿上了那身漂亮的行头。不过，无论怎么说，他和孔雀一样爱臭美；正因为如此，他才成了魔法师。

他开了门，走到楼下，打发一个女佣去叫一辆双座马车（那年头，每个人都有好多仆人），又朝客厅里张望了起来。不出他所料，蕾蒂姨妈正在那儿忙着修补一块床垫。床垫铺在临窗的地板上，她正跪在上面。

“啊，蕾蒂娅(1)，我亲爱的，”安德鲁舅舅说，“我——我呀——我要出门啦。借我五英镑或差不多这个数的钱吧，我遇到了一个好枯娘。”（他老是将“姑娘”说成“枯娘”。）

“没门儿，亲爱的安德鲁，”蕾蒂姨妈回绝得既干脆又平静，她继续忙着手中的活儿，连头也不抬一下。“我告诉过你无数次了，我是决不会借钱给你的。”

“哎呀，求求您别闹啦，亲爱的枯娘，”安德鲁舅舅说，“这事儿要紧得很。您要是不借钱给我，可会让我很难堪的。”

“安德鲁，”蕾蒂姨妈直勾勾地盯着他，“我真奇怪你向我要钱居然不觉得害臊。”

这句话的背后可有些故事呢，不过说来话长，又枯燥得很，全是些大人们的事儿。你需要知道的是，安德鲁舅舅名义上“为亲爱的蕾蒂照管财产”，却啥事儿都不干，还欠了一屁股的烟酒账（蕾蒂姨妈曾一而再，再而三地替他还钱），这可把蕾蒂搞得比三十年前穷得多啦。

“我亲爱的枯娘，”安德鲁舅舅说，“你不知道哇，我今天会有些意外的开销。我不得不去应酬一下。快点儿，别小气啦。”

“请告诉我，你要跟谁去应酬呢，安德鲁？”蕾蒂姨妈问。

“来了位尊尊——尊贵的客人。”

“尊你个头！”蕾蒂姨妈说，“都过了一小时了，我压根儿没听见门铃响。”

正在这时，门被一把推开了。蕾蒂姨妈扭头看去，吃了一惊，只见一位体形庞大的妇人站在门口，她穿着华丽，双臂裸露，目露凶光。这正是那个女巫。

(1) 蕾蒂娅是蕾蒂的昵称。





第七章　前门事发


“喂，奴才，还要让我等多久才有马车？”女巫的嗓门像雷震一般。安德鲁舅舅缩到了一边躲着她。这会儿女巫真站到他跟前了，照镜子时的那些想入非非早已消失得无影无踪。这时，蕾蒂姨妈站了起来，走到了屋子中央。

“这位年轻女郎是谁？安德鲁，能告诉我吗？”蕾蒂姨妈冷冷地问。

“尊贵的外国人——非非——非常重要的人物，”他结结巴巴地说。

“胡说！”蕾蒂姨妈说完这话，便转向女巫。“立马从我家滚出去，你这不要脸的荡妇，不然我可要报警啦。”她以为那女巫一定是从马戏团里偷跑出来的，而且，她对女巫裸着两只胳膊也颇有意见。

“这女人是谁？”简蒂丝问。“快跪下，奴才，别逼我动手。”

“请你不要在这所房子里出口伤人，女士，”蕾蒂姨妈说。

那女王立刻挺直了腰板，安德鲁舅舅觉得她比以前更高大了。她目露凶光，甩出一条胳膊，口中念念有词，发出恐怖的声音。以前，她正是这样将恰恩城宫门化成灰烬的。然而，这回却什么事也没有发生。蕾蒂姨妈以为那些可怕的咒语也就是普通的人话，便说：

“果然不出我所料，这女人喝多了。你看她醉得！连话都说不清了。”

女巫突然反应过来，在她的世界里能把人化为灰烬的魔力，在我们的世界里却失效了，这一刻对她来说一定异常可怕。但她没有片刻的手忙脚乱，也没有丝毫的沮丧失望。她扑了过去，一把抓住蕾蒂姨妈的脖子和膝盖，把她拎起来举过头顶，像举一个玩具娃娃那么轻松，一下把她甩到屋子的另一头。蕾蒂姨妈腾空而起，没等落地，一位女佣（她觉得那是个美妙的早晨，过得很爽）探进头来说：“打扰了，先生，马车已准备好了。”

“带路，奴才，”女巫对安德鲁舅舅下达命令。他口中嘀咕着“遗憾的暴行——必须抗议”之类的话，但简蒂丝白了他一眼，他便住口了。她撵他出了房间，来到屋子外面；迪格雷跑下楼来，刚好看见前门在他们身后关上了。

“真见鬼！”他说。“这下她可要在伦敦闹开了，还带了个安德鲁舅舅，真不知道会闹出什么事情来。”

“喂，迪格雷少爷，”女佣喊道（那天她别提有多开心了），“我看凯特利小姐是伤着了。”于是他俩冲到客厅里去看出了什么事儿。

要是刚才蕾蒂姨妈直接摔在地板上，或即使落在地毯上，我看都会摔得粉身碎骨。但她运气好，落在了床垫上。蕾蒂姨妈是个强悍的老妇人：那年头的姨妈们都很健壮。她吃了些提神药，静静地坐了几分钟，然后就说不碍事了，只是碰破了几块皮。很快，她就发号施令起来。

“莎拉，”她对女佣说（那天对她来说可不同往常），“快去警察局，告诉他们有个危险的精神病人跑出来了。柯克夫人的午饭我自己来弄吧。”柯克夫人嘛，自然就是迪格雷的母亲了。

照料过迪格雷的母亲吃完，迪格雷和蕾蒂姨妈才去吃午饭。饭后，他认真地思索了起来。

眼下的问题是如何把女巫给弄回去，不管怎样，也得让她尽快离开我们的世界。无论如何也不能让她在这所房子里撒野了。千万不能让妈妈看见她。还要尽可能不准她在伦敦城里横冲直撞。她企图“击垮”蕾蒂姨妈时，迪格雷不在客厅，但他曾目睹她“击垮”恰恩城的宫门；所以，他知道她有骇人的魔力，然而并不知道一旦到了我们的世界，她的魔力已经丧失殆尽。他还知道她想要征服我们的世界。据他所料，这会儿她很可能正在捣毁白金汉宫或议会大厦；几乎可以肯定，不少警察已化为一堆灰烬了。他真有点不知所措。“不过，那些戒指倒是很像磁铁，”迪格雷心想，“只要我触着她，一摸我的黄戒指，我俩就将回到各世界间的树林中去。不知道她在那里会不会又变得虚弱无力呢？是那个地方在作怪呢，还是她从自己的世界被抛到那里而受了震荡？不过，我看我是没办法了，只能去冒这个险。那么，要我上哪里找这个畜生呢？我看蕾蒂姨妈是不会让我出去的，除非向她坦白我去哪里。而我手头的钱还不到两个便士呢。我要是跑遍伦敦去找他们，得花不少钱坐汽车和电车。再说了，我压根儿不知道从哪儿找起。不知道安德鲁舅舅还是不是跟她在一起。”

到头来，他唯一能做的只是等候并盼望安德鲁舅舅和女巫回来了。他们一回来，他就得冲上去抓住女巫，然后戴上黄戒指，不要让她有机会踏进房子。这就意味着他必须像猫守着老鼠洞一样盯着前门，一刻都不能离岗。于是，他进了饭厅，像人们常说的那样，把脸“贴”在窗户上。那是一扇往外凸的窗，望出去可以看见通向前门的台阶，整条街看得一清二楚。因此，只要有人走到前门，都逃不过他的眼睛。“不知道波莉在干什么？”迪格雷心想。

他反复思考着这个问题，半小时就这么过去了，过得好慢。但你们可不要性急，让我来继续把故事讲下去吧。波莉回家吃饭迟到了，鞋袜也湿透了。大人们问她去了哪里，干了些什么，她说是跟迪格雷·柯克一块儿出去了。再盘问下去，她就说是在一个水潭里把脚弄湿的，那水潭在一个树林里。问她树林在哪儿，她说不知道。又问她是不是在一个公园里，她只好老老实实承认那地方好像是一个公园。波莉的妈妈由此断定，波莉刚才一定偷跑出去，到了伦敦某个她不知道的地方，溜进一个陌生的公园，在水坑里跳来跳去取乐来着。结果，波莉被责备太调皮了，要是以后再这样，就不准她再和“那个姓柯克的男孩子”一起玩了。这以后，她才被允许在剩菜剩饭里挑些好吃的填饱肚子。吃完后她就被打发到了床上，足足待了两个小时。那年头，这种事儿可是家常便饭。

因此，当迪格雷透过饭厅的窗户留意外面的动静时，波莉正躺在床上。他俩都诧异，时间怎么过得那么慢啊。要是换了我，我想我宁愿处在波莉的位置上。她只要熬过那两个小时就行了。而迪格雷呢，每隔几分钟，只要一有马车或面包师傅送货车的响动传来，或听到肉铺小伙计拐过街角，他就以为“她来了”，结果却是一场空。就这么时不时地使人一惊，接着又是度日如年的嘀嗒的钟声。还有一只大苍蝇——在你头顶够不着的地方——嗡嗡地撞着玻璃窗。这儿的房子到了下午总是静悄悄、昏沉沉的，而且老是有一股羊臊味儿。这所房子也不例外。

在他漫长的监视与等待中，有一个小插曲，我在这儿要提一提，因为下文发生的一件大事儿要以它为铺垫。有一位女士带了些葡萄来探望迪格雷的妈妈，因为饭厅的门开着，所以蕾蒂姨妈和那位女士在客厅里的谈话就传到了迪格雷的耳朵里。

“多好的葡萄呀！”这是蕾蒂姨妈的声音。“要是吃些什么能让她的病好起来，这些葡萄一定管用。唉，亲爱的小玛贝尔，多可怜呀！现在恐怕只有青春之土培育出的果实能治好她的病了吧。这个世界里啥都不管用了。”她俩接着谈了更多的话，但声音压得很低，迪格雷听不清楚。

要是他前几天听到什么“青春之土”，准以为那是蕾蒂姨妈的信口胡说，大人们老是这么说话，这种话根本不会引起他的兴趣。现在他差不多也这么认为。然而，他一拍脑袋，想起了的确存在着别的世界（即使蕾蒂姨妈不知道），他还到过其中的一个呢。这样看来，也许在那儿真有一片“青春之土”。什么东西都有可能存在。在别的世界里，或许真有种果子能治好妈妈的病！哦——要知道，想一样东西都想疯了该是种什么感受啊。你简直要打消那种念头了，它美得像个泡影，曾让你尝尽了失望的滋味。这就是迪格雷当时的感受，但他却遏制不住这种期望。有可能——真的，真的有那种可能。已经发生了那么多稀奇古怪的事儿了。他还有魔法戒指呢。从树林里每个水潭进去都有一个世界，他能寻遍所有的世界。终有一天，妈妈的病会好的，一切都会好的。他把留意女巫的事儿全给忘了。他的手已经向放着黄戒指的口袋伸去了，恰在此时，他突然听到一阵疾驰而来的马蹄声。

“嘿！那是什么？”迪格雷心里想。“救火车吗？不知道哪幢房子起火了。好家伙，过来了。哎呀，是她！”

用不着我告诉你他说的“她”是谁了。

最先疾驰而来的是一辆双座马车，车夫座位上空无一人。马车全速奔来，一个急拐弯，一只轮子腾空而起。车顶上——不是坐着，而是站着的——怎么晃都四平八稳的——正是女王之王，恰恩的邪神简蒂丝。只见她龇牙咧嘴，眼冒火光，长发像彗星尾巴似的飘在脑后。她毫不留情地用鞭子抽打着马。马大张着红红的鼻孔，两肋满是汗珠。它疯狂地冲向前门，然后抬起前腿，用后腿立了起来，差点儿撞上灯柱，而车厢则与灯柱撞成了碎片。女巫优美地一跳，顺利脱险，并落到了马背上。她跨上马背，俯身向前，对马耳语了几句。那一定是些让马狂躁不安，而不是使它镇静的话。马儿又立刻抬起前腿，尖厉地长啸一声，四蹄腾空，龇牙瞪眼，马鬃飞扬。只有出色的骑手才驾驭得了它。

还没等迪格雷喘口气，又有许多事情接二连三地发生了。第二辆马车紧随而来：车上跳下一个身穿礼服的胖子和一名警察。紧接着，载着另外两名警察的第三辆马车也快速赶到了。马车后面跟上来二十几个人（大多是童仆），他们骑着车，打着铃，一边喝彩一边吹口哨。还有一群人步行跟在队伍的最后面：一个个跑得浑身发热，但又乐不可支。所有临街的窗户全哗啦啦地打开了。每一座房子的前门都立着一个女佣或男仆，他们都等着看好戏呢。

这时，一位老绅士晃晃悠悠地从第一辆撞烂了的马车里挣扎着往外爬。几个人见状冲过去帮他，但这个往这儿扯，那个往那儿拉，也许没人帮他的话，他倒早爬出来了。迪格雷猜到那位老绅士一定是安德鲁舅舅，虽然看不清他的脸：他的高筒礼帽被撞下来正好扣住了他的脸。

迪格雷冲进了人群。

“就是这个女人，就是她，”一位胖子指着简蒂丝大喊。“把她抓起来，警察！她从我店里抢了价值成千上万的东西。瞧她脖子上的珍珠项链，那是我的。她还给了我的眼睛一拳，都打青了。”

“她真是好身手哇，长官，”人群中有人说。“好一只青眼睛，我最乐意看。她一定干得很漂亮。哇！她真强悍！”

“你该在青眼睛上搁上块好吃的生牛排，先生，那才般配呢，”一个肉铺小伙计说。

“喂，”那个警察头子说，“这里到底出了什么事？”

“我来说，她——”那个胖子刚开口，就有人喊了起来：

“别让马车里那老家伙溜走，是他唆使她干的。”

那位老绅士，自然就是安德鲁舅舅了。这会儿他已经站了起来，正揉着身上摔坏的地方。“那么，你说，”警察转过身对着他，“到底出了什么事儿？”

“嗡嗡——噗噗——嘘嘘——”安德鲁舅舅的声音从帽子里传了出来。

“行了行了，”警察厉声说，“你知道这可不容你胡闹。摘掉帽子，听到了没有？”

这可是说来容易做来难。安德鲁舅舅怎么也不能把头从帽子里挣脱出来，另外两位警察一把抓住帽檐，硬把帽子拔了下来。

“谢谢，谢谢，”安德鲁舅舅有气无力地说，“谢天谢地，可把我吓坏了。哪位行行好，给我一小杯白兰地——”

“好了，请注意回答我的问题，”那位警察说着掏出一个大笔记本和一小截铅笔。“那个年轻妇人归你管吗？”

“小心！”几个人异口同声地喊道，还好那位警察及时向后跳了一步，那匹马朝他踢了过来，差点将他踢死。接着，女巫掉转马头，面对着人群，马的后腿踏在了人行道上。她手里挥着一把明晃晃的长刀，一阵猛砍，想把马与撞烂了的马车分开。

在这段时间里，迪格雷一直候着机会触到女巫。这可不太容易，因为离他最近的一边人太多了，而要绕到另一边，就得从马蹄和栅栏之间穿过去，栅栏围着一片空地，下面是凯特利家的地下室。如果你了解马的脾气，特别是看到那匹马那会儿的样子，就知道不容易穿过去了。迪格雷很了解马，但他还是咬紧牙关，一瞅准时机就准备冲过去。

这时候，一个脸涨得通红，戴着圆顶礼帽的男子，用肩膀拱开人群，挤到了最前面。

“嘿，警察，”他说，“她骑的那匹马是俺的，撞烂的那辆马车也是俺的。”

“一次说一件事，一样一样地来，”警察说。

“可来不及了呀，”马车夫说。“俺比你了解这马，它可不是一般的马，它爹当过骑兵队长官的坐骑。要是这女人再激它，可要出人命了。唉，把它交给我吧。”

警察巴不得找个理由离那匹马远些呢。马车夫走近了一步，抬头看着简蒂丝，客客气气地说：

“来吧，小姐，我抓住马头，您下来吧。您是位小姐，不想惹上麻烦，是不是？您想回家，喝上杯香茶，静静地打个盹儿，这就感觉舒坦啦。”他一边说，一边伸手去牵马头，嘴里嘀咕着：“镇静，‘草莓’，老伙计。你可要镇静呀。”

这时，女巫终于开口说话了。

“狗东西！”她冷酷、洪亮的嗓音震荡起来，盖过了其他所有的声音，“狗东西，放开我的皇家战马。我是女王简蒂丝。”





第八章　灯柱前的搏斗


“哦！你是女王？我们得弄弄清楚，”一个声音说。另一个声音接着喊：“让我们为疯人院的女王三呼万岁吧！”不少人跟着喊了起来。女巫红光满面，微微地鞠了一躬。但欢呼声立刻变成一阵哄笑，她知道这些人在寻她开心。她脸色一变，把刀换到了左手，不等人们反应过来，就干了一件可怕的事情。她伸出右臂，轻轻松松就将灯柱上的一根横杆扭了下来，仿佛干了一件世界上最平常的事儿。虽说她的魔力在我们的世界丧失了，可她的气力依然存在；她可以将一根铁棍像麦芽糖似的掰断。她将这件新武器抛了起来，又一把接住，挥舞着，策马前进。

“机会来啦，”迪格雷想到这里，一个箭步冲到马和栅栏之间，开始奋力追赶。只要那牲口稍微一停，他就能抓住女巫的脚后跟。正当他往前冲去，只听见闷头闷脑的“哐”的一声，女巫的铁棍已砸在那个警察头子的头盔上：他像根柱子似的倒了下去。

“快，迪格雷，得制止她，”背后传来一个声音。正是波莉！她一经允许下床，就往这里赶了过来。

“你可真是好样的，”迪格雷说。“紧紧拉住我。你来管戒指，那枚黄的。记好喽，我一喊你就戴上。”

又“哐”的一声，另一名警察倒了下去。人群中发出愤怒的吼声：“把她拖下来。拿铺路石砸她。快去叫军队。”可大多数人都尽量避得远远的。然而，在场所有人中最勇敢、心肠最好的，显然要算那位马车夫了。他左躲右闪地避开铁棍，逼近了马，试图抓住马头。

人群又骚动了起来，乱糟糟地一阵吼叫。一块石头嗖的一声从迪格雷头上飞过，紧接着便传来女巫洪钟般的嗓音，听起来似乎十分得意：

“浑蛋！等我征服了你们的世界，你们要为此付出沉痛的代价。我要毁掉你们的城市，毁得像恰恩、费林达、索罗瓦和布拉满丁一样，寸土不留。”

迪格雷终于抓到了她的脚踝。她一脚反踢，后跟正中迪格雷的嘴巴。他疼得撒开了手，嘴唇被踢破了，满嘴鲜血。从很近的什么地方传来了安德鲁舅舅的声音，喊得嗓子都颤了起来：“夫人——我亲爱的年轻女士——看在上帝的分上——快住手吧。”迪格雷再次抓住了她的脚后跟，但又被甩开了。更多的人被她的铁棍击倒了。他第三次抓住她的脚后跟，死死地抓住，接着对波莉大喊一声“走”！接着——哦，谢天谢地，愤怒而惊恐的脸庞一张张消失了，愤怒而惊恐的声音也沉寂了下来，除了黑暗中从迪格雷身旁传来一阵呜咽，那是安德鲁舅舅在哭诉：“噢，噢，我中邪了吗？要完蛋了吗？我受不了啦。太不公平了。我从未想过要当魔法师。全是误会。都怪我的教母；我要抗议。我都这把老骨头了。古老的多塞特郡家族啊。”

“真倒霉！”迪格雷心想。“咱们可不想带上他。好家伙，一切顺利。你在那里吗，波莉？”

“嘿，我在这里。别老推我。”

“我没推，”迪格雷刚一开口，还没来得及说下去，他们的头就钻出了水潭，又来到了那片温暖、葱郁、阳光明媚的树林里。一出水潭，波莉就大叫起来：

“喂，快看！我们把那匹老马也带来了，还有凯特利先生，还有那马车夫。真是一团糟了！”

女巫一看自己又到了那片树林里，脸色即刻变得惨白。她弯下腰去，把脸贴在了马鬃上，你看得出她非常难受。安德鲁舅舅浑身哆嗦着。倒是草莓，那匹马，摇头晃脑，还快活地嘶叫了一声，好像安静多了。自从迪格雷见到它，它就没这么安静过。先前，它的耳朵一直朝后贴在脑袋上，现在恢复了正常的位置，眼里的怒火也消失了。

“这就对了，好伙计，”马车夫一边说，一边拍着草莓的脖子，“这样就好了，别紧张啊。”

草莓干了一件世界上再自然不过的事。它太口渴了（这也难怪），于是慢慢走到最近的一个水潭边，跨进去喝起水来。迪格雷依然抓着女巫的脚后跟，波莉则拉着迪格雷的手。马车夫的一只手搭在草莓身上，另一只手被仍在哆嗦的安德鲁舅舅紧紧抓着。

“快！”波莉朝迪格雷使了个眼色，喊道。“绿戒指！”

于是，还没等马儿喝上水，整群人便又坠入了黑暗。草莓嘶吼着；安德鲁舅舅啜泣着。迪格雷则说：“运气还不赖。”

突然间停顿了一下子，波莉问：“我们怎么还没到呢？”

“我们确实像是到了什么地方，”迪格雷说，“至少我有地方落脚了。”

“咦，你这么一说，我倒也这么觉得了，”波莉说，“可怎么会那么黑呢？我说，我们是不是跳错水潭了？”

“也许恰恩就是这样，”迪格雷说，“只不过我们是半夜回来的。”

“这里不是恰恩，”传来了女巫的声音，“这是个虚无之国，这里空无一物。”

这里确实像是个虚无之国。天空中没有一颗星星，黑暗中谁也看不见谁，眼睛睁开和闭上没什么区别。他们正踩在一块凉飕飕的平地上，那可能是泥土，而不太会是草地或者木头。空气又冷又干，一丝风也没有。

“我的末日到了，”女巫说得异常平静，平静得让人恐惧。

“哦，别这么说，”安德鲁舅舅语无伦次地说，“我亲爱的年轻女士，求您了，快别这么说了，事情没那么严重。啊——马车夫——我的好人——你不会正巧没带酒瓶来吧？我需要来口烈酒。”

“听好喽，听好喽，”马车夫操着他那副坚定而洪亮的好嗓音喊道，“听俺说，大伙儿，都安静。没有人跌断骨头，是吧？很好。嗯，真得感谢老天爷，这么摔下来，真没想到居然没事儿。要是咱们掉在了工地上——例如一个新地铁站——很快就会有人过来把咱们给撵出去的，肯定！咱们要是死了——这很难说——那么，你们该记得出海比这更糟，人嘛，总是要死的。一个人体体面面地活过啦，死也就没啥好怕的了。你们要是想打发一下时间，让俺看呀，最好的法子莫过于唱一首圣歌了。”

他说着就唱了起来，唱了一首收获感恩颂，感谢庄稼被“顺利收进了仓”。在一个似乎打创世以来便寸草不生的地方唱这种歌，是不怎么合适的，可这是他记得最清楚的一首歌了。他有一副好嗓子，于是孩子们也跟着唱了起来，唱得欢天喜地的。只有安德鲁舅舅和女巫没有加入。

歌快唱完时，迪格雷觉得有人在拽他的胳膊。从那股白兰地和雪茄的浓烈气味以及那身考究的行头，他判断那一定是安德鲁舅舅。安德鲁舅舅偷偷地把他从人群中拉了出来，拉到一边后，这老家伙把嘴凑近迪格雷的耳边——触得他耳朵直痒痒——鬼头鬼脑地说：

“来吧，我的孩子，戴上戒指，咱们开溜吧。”

女巫的耳朵异常灵敏。“蠢货！”她大喊一声，从马旁边跳了过来。“你忘了我能听见人的心思吗？放开那男孩。你要敢违抗我的命令，我就用有史以来闻所未闻的手段来报复你。”

“听着，”迪格雷补充道，“你要是以为我是一头卑鄙的猪，可以抛下波莉、马车夫和那匹马，只管自个儿溜走，那就大错而特错了。”

“好个没规矩的野小子，”安德鲁舅舅说。

“静一静！”马车夫说。他们都竖起了耳朵。

终于，黑暗中出现了一丝动静。一个声音唱了起来。声音从很远的地方传来，迪格雷辨不清它是从哪个方向传来的。有时，声音似乎从四面八方一股脑儿涌来。有时，他又觉得声音像是从他们的地底下传来的。声音低下去时就像从大地发出似的。没有歌词，也没有曲调，然而迪格雷却觉得它无与伦比，可以说是他所听过的最美妙的声音了。那声音美得让他受不了。那匹马似乎也喜欢；它嘶叫了几声，仿佛拉了多年的车以后，又踏上了童年时代嬉戏过的故土，并看见有个它记得的并爱着的人，正拿着糖块穿过田野向它走来。

“天哪，”马车夫说，“真好听啊！”

过了会儿，两个奇迹就在同时发生了。第一个奇迹是：突然间跟着响起了许多其他的声音，多得你都数不过来。它们与那个声音配合得十分和谐，但音阶却高得多：声音冷冰冰的，银铃似的叮叮咚咚响着。第二个奇迹是：头顶的黑暗中突然群星闪耀。它们不是像在夏季夜空中那样一颗接一颗闪现的，而是从漆黑中，一下子跃出了成千上万的恒星、行星以及星座，都比我们世界里的要大得多、亮得多。天空中万里无云。新的星星和新的声音恰在同时出现。你要是像迪格雷那样亲眼看见并亲耳听见的话，便会相当肯定，那唱着歌的正是那些星星，而使它们显现并歌唱的，正是第一个低沉的声音。

“多壮观呀！”马车夫说。“要是早知道这等事儿，俺这辈子能做个更好的人呢。”

地上的声音更嘹亮、更雄赳赳的了；然而天上的声音，在与地上的声音一阵嘹亮的合唱之后，便开始沉寂下去。这时，另一件事情发生了。

在很远处，靠近地平线的地方，天空慢慢灰了起来。一阵清风腾地而起。天上那块地方的颜色一点一点变得暗淡，高耸的群山在它的映衬下显出黑暗的轮廓。那声音仍在这么唱着。

不一会儿，天色已经亮到能看清对方的脸了。马车夫和那两个孩子张大了嘴，目光闪烁，沉醉在歌声之中；那歌声仿佛使他们想起了什么。安德鲁舅舅也张大了嘴，但不是高兴得张嘴，他看上去更像下巴从脸上脱落了。他肩膀耷拉着，膝盖颤抖着。他不喜欢那个声音。要是能钻到老鼠洞里去躲一躲的话，他早钻进去了。但女巫似乎比任何人更能理解那种音乐。她抿着嘴，双唇紧闭，拳头紧握。歌声刚响起，她就感到这个世界充满着一种与她不同的魔力，但比她的更为强大。她恨这种魔力。为了阻止那歌声，她不惜捣毁这个世界以至所有的世界。马儿站在那里，耳朵前伸，不停地抽动着，还时不时打几个响鼻并用蹄子跺几下地面。已经看不出它是匹疲惫不堪的拉车老马了，你现在完全可以相信它的爹曾冲锋陷阵过。

东边的天际由白色转成粉色，又由粉色转成了金色。那声音越升越高，最后连空气都随之震颤起来。声音升到最嘹亮、最雄伟的那一刻，太阳升起来了。

迪格雷从未见过这样的太阳。恰恩废墟上空的太阳看起来比我们的太阳年迈，而这轮太阳却比我们的年轻。你可以想象，它是兴高采烈地升起来的。当阳光普照着大地，他们第一次看清了自己到了一个什么样的地方。那是一个峡谷，一条宽阔而汹涌的河流蜿蜒而过，往东奔向太阳升起的地方。南边大山耸立，北边丘陵起伏。峡谷里只有泥土、岩石和水，没有树，也没有灌木，连一片草叶都见不到。泥土是五颜六色的，新鲜、温热，充满蓬勃生机，令你感到激动。而当你亲眼看到了那位歌唱者，便把其余的一切全抛脑后了。

唱歌的是一头狮子。它体形庞大，毛发浓密，生气勃勃，面朝升起的太阳站着。它张大嘴巴唱着歌，离他们大约三百码远。

“这个世界太恐怖了，”女巫说，“我们得马上离开。准备施魔法吧。”

“我太同意您了，夫人，”安德鲁舅舅说。“这地方真让人讨厌，十足的荒蛮。我要是年轻力壮，还有一杆枪的话——”

“枪！”马车夫说。“难道你想射死它，不是吧？”

“谁要射死它？”波莉问。

“准备施魔法，老蠢货，”简蒂丝说。

“遵命，夫人，”安德鲁舅舅狡猾地说。“我得让两个孩子抓着我。马上戴上回去的戒指，迪格雷，”他想撇下女巫溜之大吉。

“哦，原来是戒指搞的鬼，对吗？”简蒂丝吼叫起来。说时迟那时快，眼看她的手就要伸进迪格雷的口袋了，迪格雷一把拉过波莉，大声说：

“别乱来！你俩要敢过来半步，我俩就立马消失，你们可就永远留在这里啦。对，我口袋里有一枚戒指，能带我和波莉回家。看！我一下子就能够着。快给我退回去。我对你很抱歉，”（他看着马车夫）“也对不起那匹马，但我没有办法。至于你俩，”（他看着安德鲁舅舅和女巫）“你们都是魔法师，应该很高兴在一起生活。”

“大伙儿别吵啦，”马车夫说，“俺想听会儿这音乐。”

因为这时候歌声已经变了。





第九章　纳尼亚诞生记


狮子在空旷的大地上踱来踱去，唱着一支崭新的歌，这支歌比刚才唤起星星和太阳的那支更柔和、更轻快，恰似潺潺的流水。它边走边唱，峡谷里随之长出碧草，从狮子的身旁像水潭一样荡漾开去，又如浪花一般爬上了山坡。不一会儿，青草就向远处大山的斜坡低处开始攀爬，使那个年轻的世界一刻比一刻更柔美。此刻，只听见微风簌簌吹拂着碧草。很快，除了草，又有别的东西出现了。高处的山坡上开满了颜色暗沉的石南花。还有一株株又粗又短又硬的绿色的东西从峡谷里成片成片地冒了出来。迪格雷不明白这是些什么，直到有一株在他身旁冒了出来，他才看清楚那是种细细尖尖的东西，还伸着几十只胳膊呢，每只胳膊上都蒙着一层绿色。这种东西以每两秒钟一寸的速度迅速生长。现在，在他周围已有十几株这样的东西了。等它们长到与他差不多高的时候，他才看出那是什么。“树！”他大叫了起来。

令人无奈的是，正如波莉后来说的，你无法静下心来观赏这一切。当迪格雷喊出“树”的一刹那，他不得不一脚跳开，因为安德鲁舅舅又偷偷摸摸靠近他，企图把手伸进他的口袋里。不过，即使他偷到也没用，因为他一直以为绿戒指是管回去的，于是就盯住了右边的口袋。不过，迪格雷当然也不想丢了这枚戒指。

“住手！”女巫大叫了一声。“站回去。快，再往后退。谁要是离这两个孩子中的任何一个不到十步，我就砸扁他的脑袋。”她手里掂着那根从灯柱上扭下来的铁棍，随时准备砸过去。不管怎么说，没有人怀疑她会把人砸扁。

“哼！”她说，“你想带着这男孩儿偷溜回你们的世界，把我甩在这儿啊。”

终于，安德鲁舅舅的怒火压倒了对她的恐惧。“不错，夫人，”他说，“我就是想这么干。我想干什么是我的权利。我受尽了羞辱和虐待。我曾扑心扑肝来巴结你，可结果得了什么好处？你抢劫了——我一定得重复这两个字——抢劫了颇受人尊敬的珠宝商。你非要我款待你吃一顿贵得要命，更甭说是十分铺张的午餐，害得我只能当掉我的怀表和表链（告诉你吧，夫人，咱家还没有谁有经常光顾当铺的习惯呢，除了我那参加过义勇骑兵队的表哥爱德华）。吃着那顿让人消化不下的午餐时——现在想起来都让我更难受——你的一言一行惹得在座的每个人看了你都摇头。我觉得我在公众面前丢了脸，我可再也没脸去那家饭店了。你还袭击了警察，还偷了——”

“唉，别说了，老爷，不要再说了，”马车夫说，“还是把眼睛和耳朵放在眼下发生的事儿上吧，不要说话了。”

需要去关注和聆听的事情实在太多了。迪格雷刚才注意到的那棵树，现已长成了一棵粗壮的山毛榉，枝丫轻轻地在他头顶挥舞着。他们脚下那片凉爽而碧绿的草地上缀满了雏菊和毛茛。稍远处，柳树沿着河岸生长着。河对岸，长满了一丛丛灯笼果、丁香花、野玫瑰和杜鹃花。那匹马儿正美滋滋地啃着鲜嫩的青草呢。

狮子还在不停地歌唱，并雄赳赳气昂昂地来回踱着步子。令人害怕的是，它每一转身，就走近他们一些。波莉发现这歌声越来越有趣了，因为她觉得自己开始明白这音乐与眼下正发生的事情之间的联系了。当大约一百码以外的山脊上冒出一排暗绿色的冷杉时，她感到这和前一秒狮子唱的一组低沉而悠长的曲调有关。当狮子唱出了一组轻快的旋律，她毫不奇怪地看见四处开满了报春花。于是，她有一种说不出的激动，觉得这些东西肯定是（用她的话来说）“从狮子的脑袋里长出来的”。你聆听着它的歌声，就能听出它创造了什么；你环顾四周，就看见了这些东西。这太令人激动了，她都没来得及感到害怕。然而，狮子每一次转身走近他们一些时，迪格雷和马车夫都不禁有些紧张。至于安德鲁舅舅，他牙齿打战，膝盖发抖，想逃也逃不掉了。

突然，女巫壮着胆子朝狮子冲了过去。狮子仍唱着歌，迈着缓慢而沉稳的步伐。离了只有十二码远的距离，女巫举起手臂，瞄准狮子的头，将铁棍径直地投了过去。

不会有人在这么近的距离打偏，更别说是简蒂丝了。铁棍正中狮子两眼之间，一擦而过，砰的一声掉落在草地上。但狮子继续踱着步子，没有放慢也没有加快；你都弄不明白它是否知道自己被袭击了一下。虽然它柔软的脚掌没有发出一点声响，你却能感到大地在它的脚下震颤着。

女巫惊叫了一声撒腿就跑，很快就消失在树林里。安德鲁舅舅想随她开溜，一转身，不料绊倒在一个树桩上，脸朝下栽进了一条向着大河奔流的小溪中。孩子们都动弹不得了，甚至不知道自己是否想跑。而狮子根本没注意他们，它张着血盆大口，唱着歌，没有咆哮。它打他们身旁走过，近得可以摸到它的鬣毛。他俩害怕极了，生怕它转过身来看着他们，但又希望它这么做，这是一种奇怪的心理在作祟。可是，狮子压根儿没注意他们，好像他们是看不见、闻不着的东西。它打他们身旁经过，走了几步，又折回来走过他们身旁，接着，便向东而去了。

安德鲁舅舅爬了起来，一边咳嗽一边嘴里念念有词。

“哎呀，迪格雷，”他说道，“我们好不容易摆脱了那个女人，狮子也走了。快把手伸给我，赶紧戴上戒指。”

“滚开，”迪格雷说，一边后退几步避开他。“离他远点儿，波莉，到我身边来。我现在警告你，安德鲁舅舅，你要敢走近一步，我们立马就消失。”

“马上照我说的做，老兄，”安德鲁舅舅说。“你这小鬼，太不听话，太调皮捣蛋了。”

“没门儿，”迪格雷说，“我们要待在这儿看看有啥事情发生。我还以为你想要好好了解一番别的世界呢，现在都到这里了，怎么不喜欢啦？”

“喜欢！”安德鲁舅舅大声喊道。“看看我成了一副什么样子！这可是我最好的外套和背心哪。”他现在看上去的确一副狼狈相：因为他一开始打扮得很有派头，之后从撞烂的马车里爬出来又掉进泥沟里，模样当然就越惨不忍睹了。“我不是说，”他补充道，“这个地方没意思。要是我再年轻一些，啊呀——我或许可以先找个壮小伙儿来这里，一个专猎大家伙的猎手。这地方似乎有些特别之处，它气候宜人，我从没感受过这样的空气。我相信，这一定对我有好处，要是——要是我没倒这大霉。要是咱有杆枪就好了。”

“让你的枪见鬼去吧，”马车夫说。“俺在想是不是该去给草莓梳理一下了。那匹马可比有些人有灵性多了。”他走回到草莓身边，嘴里发出马车夫的那种嘘嘘声。

“你以为那头狮子能一枪打死吗？”迪格雷问。“它睬都没睬那根铁棍。”

“都怪她，”安德鲁舅舅说，“真是个胆大包天的枯娘，我的孩子，她干了这么件不要命的事儿。”他搓着双手，将指关节掰得啪啪乱响，似乎又忘了只要女巫一出现自己就会吓破胆。

“这么干实在不地道，”波莉说。“狮子伤害她了吗？”

“嗨！那是什么？”迪格雷说完，一个箭步上前，去查看几步开外的一个什么东西。“喂，波莉，”他扭头喊道，“快过来看。”

安德鲁舅舅也跟着波莉过来了，他倒不是想看个究竟，而是想挨近孩子们——好有机会偷到戒指。可是，他一看见迪格雷正注视着的东西，也产生了兴趣。那是一个小巧而精美的灯柱模型，大约三英尺高，在他们的注视之下，正按比例升高并变宽呢；其实，它正像一棵树一样生长着。

“它也是活的——我是说，它亮着，”迪格雷说。它确实亮着，不过，太阳光太强了，你不挡住阳光，就很难看清灯内燃着的微弱的火苗。

“太棒了，真是太棒了，”安德鲁舅舅嘀咕着，“我连做梦都想不到会有这种魔法。我们居然到了这么一个世界，所有的东西，甚至一个灯柱，都是有生命的，都会生长。不知道这个灯柱是什么种子发的芽？”

“你还不明白吗？”迪格雷说。“这里是铁棍落地的那个地方——她从家门前灯柱上扭下来的那根铁棍。它插进了土里，这会儿就长成了一个小灯柱。”（但此时它已不算小了；迪格雷说这话时，灯柱已长得和他一样高了。）

“好家伙！太神奇了，真是太神奇了！”安德鲁舅舅一边说，一边更起劲地搓着手。“哼哼！叫他们嘲笑我的魔法吧。我那傻瓜妹妹还以为我是个疯子呢。这回，我倒要看看他们还有什么可说的。我已经发现了一个万事万物充满生机、都可以生长的世界。哥伦布，如今他们老在谈论哥伦布，可是跟这儿相比，美洲算得了什么？这儿的商业潜力是不可估量的。带些破铜烂铁过来，往这儿一埋，就会长出崭新的火车头、军舰，或任何你想要的东西。不费一分钱成本，就能在英国卖个好价钱。我就要成为百万富翁啦。还有这儿的气候！我都感到自己年轻了好几岁。我可以把这里打造成一个疗养胜地，在这地方经营，一年准能挣两万。当然，我只能让极少数人知道这个秘密。首先得干掉那头畜生。”

“你和那女巫一个德行，”波莉骂道，“满脑子杀杀杀的。”

“接下来，就该为我自己打算了，”安德鲁舅舅继续做着他的美梦。“如果我在这儿住下，天知道我能活多少岁。对于一个年过花甲的人来说，这是值得考虑的头等大事。在这里，我永葆青春可就不足为怪了！太神奇了！青春之土呀！”

“哦！”迪格雷大叫一声。“青春之土！你真认为是吗？”他当然记得蕾蒂姨妈对那位捎来葡萄的女士说过的话，于是，美好的愿望又涌向他的脑海了。“安德鲁舅舅，”他说，“你觉得这儿真有什么东西能治好妈妈的病吗？”

“你说什么呢？”安德鲁舅舅说。“这儿又不是药店。不过，我刚刚还说呢——”

“你一点儿都不关心她，”迪格雷气不打一处来，“我还以为你会关心她呢；毕竟她是你妹妹，也是我的母亲。不过，无所谓啦。我倒是很乐意去问问狮子，看它能不能帮上忙。”说完，他转身飞快地走了。波莉犹豫了一下，也跟着去了。

“嘿！快给我停下！回来！这孩子疯了，”安德鲁舅舅嚷着，跟在孩子们后面，又小心翼翼地隔开一段距离；因为他既不想离绿戒指太远，又不想靠狮子太近。

几分钟后，迪格雷走到了树林边上，在那里站住了。狮子仍唱着歌，但这会儿歌声又变了。这回的歌声与我们所谓的“调子”更相似，但更为狂放，听得你直想跑起来，跳起来，想去攀登，想要大喊大叫，想冲过去拥抱别人或与他们搏斗。迪格雷听得满脸通红发热。安德鲁舅舅似乎也受了这歌声的影响，因为迪格雷听见他说：“好个火辣的妹子，老兄。她的脾气真令人遗憾，但仍旧是个顶呱呱的妞儿，好个娘儿们。”然而，歌声对他俩产生的影响与对这片土地产生的影响相比，就根本算不上什么了。

你能想象一块草地像壶里的沸水似的咕咚冒泡吗？而这正是对眼下发生的事情最恰当的描述了。从四面八方鼓起了一个又一个的大丘小丘，有的不过鼹鼠丘那么大，有的和独轮车差不多大，其中两个有小别墅那么大。这些圆丘移动着，膨胀着，最后爆裂开来，泥土四溅，从每个圆丘里钻出了一个动物。鼹鼠钻了出来，那姿势跟你在英国见到的鼹鼠一模一样。狗也钻了出来，一探出脑袋就汪汪乱叫，像从篱笆的细缝里挤过去那样叫着。最有意思的是雄鹿，因为它们的角钻出来了好一会儿，其他部分才出来，所以一开始迪格雷还以为是树呢。青蛙也从河边钻出来了，一出来就扑通跳进河里，呱呱叫着。豹子一类的动物则马上坐了下来，清理掉粘在后腿上的浮土，然后起身趴在树上磨起了前爪。一大群一大群的鸟儿从树林里飞出来了。蝴蝶翩翩起舞。蜜蜂在花丛间忙碌着，好像一秒钟也不愿耽搁。然而最壮观的一刻则要数最大的圆丘突然炸裂了，它仿佛掀起一阵小小的地震，从那里面隆起了一个倾斜的脊背，接着是一个巨大的灵活的脑袋和四条像是穿着松松垮垮的裤子的大腿，大象就这么出来了。这会儿，你几乎听不见狮子的歌唱了，到处都传来动物的叫唤，啊啊、嗷嗷、咕咕、嘶嘶、汪汪、咩咩、呜呜……

虽然迪格雷听不见狮子的歌唱，但还看得见它。它体形庞大，皮毛光亮，他不由得注视着它。别的动物似乎并不怕它。就在那时，迪格雷听见身后传来一阵马蹄声；过了一会儿，那匹拉车的老马从他身边一路小跑着过去，加入了那些动物的行列。（这儿的空气对它和对安德鲁舅舅一样适合。它看上去已不像伦敦街头的可怜巴巴的老奴了；它扬起了蹄子，高昂着头。）这会儿，狮子才安静了下来。它在动物中来回踱着步子，时不时地走到其中的两个面前（每次总是两个），用它的鼻子碰碰它们的鼻子。在海狸群中，它碰了碰两只海狸的鼻子；在豹群中，它又碰了碰两只豹子的鼻子；在鹿群中，它也同样碰了碰两只鹿的鼻子。每次总是一雌一雄，剩下的就不管了。有几种动物它将它们撇在一边，而与它碰过鼻子的那些动物则成双成对地离开了自己的种群，尾随在它身后。最后，它站住了，与它碰过鼻子的动物走过来，围着它站成了一个大圈。没有与它碰过鼻子的动物开始四散而去，叫声逐渐消失在远方。这时，那些被选出来的动物全都一声不响地站着，目不转睛地看着狮子。有些动物像猫一般安安静静，除了偶尔摇一下尾巴，几乎一动不动。在那天，这是第一次静得连一点儿声音都没有，只听见潺潺的水声。迪格雷的心怦怦直跳，他知道神圣而庄严的事情就要发生了。他没有忘记妈妈，但是他非常清楚，即使为了她，也不能打扰这样的大事儿。

狮子的眼睛从未眨过一下，它用这双眼睛凝视着那些动物，似乎要用目光使它们燃烧起来。渐渐地，那些动物起了变化。较小的动物——如兔子啊，鼹鼠啊，等等——长大了许多。庞大的动物——这点在大象身上最明显——则缩小了一些。许多动物用后腿蹲坐着，其中大多数侧着头，好像使劲想搞清楚什么。狮子张大嘴，却没有出声；它长长地哈出一口热气，这口气能将所有的动物刮走，就像风刮倒一排树一样。头顶高处的蓝色天幕中，星星又唱起了一支纯美、清冷而又令人费解的歌。后来，不知从天上还是狮子身上，突然有火光一闪（但没伤着任何人），使孩子们身体里的每一滴血液都沸腾了起来。接着，一个他们从未听到过的最低沉、最粗犷的声音说：

“纳尼亚，纳尼亚，醒来吧，纳尼亚。要有爱，要有思想，还要有语言。树木走动起来，野兽讲起话来，神圣之水涌出来吧。”





第十章　第一个笑柄及其他


这当然是狮子的声音了。孩子们早就觉得它能说话，可真等它开口说起话来，他们还真是又惊又喜。

树林里走出了野人，还有男男女女的树神；农牧之神、林神和小矮人也跟着出来了。河里，河神带着他的女儿们探出了头。他们和所有的鸟兽扯着高高低低、粗粗细细的五花八门的嗓门儿回答狮子：

“向您致敬！阿斯兰。我们听见了，我们服从您。我们苏醒了。我们要去爱，去思考，去说话，去弄懂一切。”

“可是，我们懂得的还是太少，”一个瓮声瓮气的声音说。孩子们听了都跳了起来，因为说话的正是那匹拉车的马。

“好样的，老草莓，”波莉说。“我真高兴它能被选为会说话的动物。”马车夫这会儿正站在孩子们身边，说：“这真让俺吃了一惊哟。不过，俺一直就说这匹马很有灵性。”

“生灵们，我让你们拥有你们自己啦，”阿斯兰用铿锵而愉悦的声音说，“我让纳尼亚这片土地永远属于你们。这里的树木、果实和河流也属于你们。我还把星星以及我自己给了你们。我没有挑选的那些哑兽也是你们的，要善待并珍惜它们，但不要走回头路，以免你们变回不会说话的野兽。因为你们是从它们中间挑选出来的，你们有可能走它们的老路。不要重蹈覆辙。”

“不会的，阿斯兰，我们不会走回头路！”它们齐声回应。一只多嘴的寒鸦扯开嗓门加了一句：“绝不！”大伙儿都住口了它才冷不丁冒出这么一句，所以，在一片沉寂中，它的声音格外清楚。也许，你已经知道，这可是一件不雅的事儿——比方说，在一次聚会上。寒鸦尴尬极了，连忙把头埋进翅膀里，装作要睡觉的样子。其他的动物开始发出各种千奇百怪的声音，这是它们在发笑呢，而这种笑，在我们的世界里，当然是谁也没有听见过的。起先，它们还想使劲儿憋住不笑，但阿斯兰说：

“笑吧，别害怕，生灵们。既然你们不再是哑巴，不再愚昧无知，就不应该总是板着脸孔。因为有了语言，就会有玩笑，也会有正义。”

于是，动物们放声大笑起来。这种欢快的气氛又令那只寒鸦鼓足勇气，一下蹦到了那匹拉车的马的头上，停在它的两只耳朵中间，鼓动着翅膀说：

“阿斯兰！阿斯兰！我开了第一个玩笑，是吗？是不是以后大家都知道我是怎样开这第一个玩笑的？”

“不，小朋友，”狮子说，“你不是开第一个玩笑，而是成了第一个笑柄。”说完，大伙儿比刚才笑得更起劲了；可寒鸦满不在乎，也跟着大伙儿笑了起来。笑到后来，马一晃脑袋，它一失足，就掉了下来，但还没等它落地，它就想起了自己还有翅膀呢（那对翅膀还没有用过呢）。

“现在，”阿斯兰说，“纳尼亚诞生了。下一步，我们必须设法保卫它的安全。我将从你们当中挑选出我的智囊团。到我这边来，你，小矮人头领；你，河神；你，橡树；你，猫头鹰先生；再加上你俩，乌鸦夫妇；还有你，大象先生。我们必须共商国是。虽然这个世界诞生还不到五个小时，但邪恶已经潜入了。”

它刚才任命的动物们走上前来，它转过身，率领它们向东而去。其余的动物开始议论纷纷，有的在问：“它说什么已经潜入咱们的世界了？——是一只‘伊佛儿(1)’？——什么是‘伊佛儿’？——不，它说的不是一只‘伊佛儿’，它说的一只‘维佛儿’——唉，到底是什么玩意儿呢？”

“嗨，”迪格雷对波莉说，“我得跟着它——我是说，跟着阿斯兰，那头狮子。我要与它谈谈。”

“你觉得咱们可以吗？”波莉说。“我可不敢。”

“我必须去，”迪格雷说，“为了妈妈。要是有谁能给我一样能治好她病的东西，那就只能是它了。”

“让俺跟着去吧，”马车夫说，“俺喜欢它那股子神气劲儿。别的动物嘛，俺不指望自己能讨它们喜欢，俺只想和俺的老草莓说上一句话。”

于是，三个人迈开步子，大胆地——或者说壮着胆子——朝那群动物走去。动物们正忙着聊天和交朋友呢，直到这三个人走近时才注意到他们。它们也没有听见安德鲁舅舅的动静，他穿着一双扣得紧紧的靴子，站在远处瑟瑟发抖，嘴里喊着（可是没有憋足了劲儿）：

“迪格雷！回来！叫你回来你就得马上回来。我不许你再往前走一步。”

最后，他们走到了动物们中间，动物们都不聊天了，只管盯着他们看。

“咦？”海狸先生终于开口问，“阿斯兰在上，告诉我这究竟是群什么玩意儿？”

“很抱歉，”迪格雷上气不接下气地刚想说下去，一只兔子打断他，“它们是一种大莴苣，错不了。”

“不，我们不是，我们真的不是，”波莉急忙说，“我们可不是什么好吃的东西。”

“嗨！”鼹鼠说。“他们会说话！谁听说过有会说话的莴苣？”

“也许他们是第二个笑柄，”寒鸦说。

一头黑豹正在洗脸，它停了一下，说，“嗯，就算是的话，也没有第一个好笑。至少，我看不出他们有啥可笑的。”它打了个呵欠，继续洗它的脸。

“哦，很抱歉，”迪格雷说，“我等不及了，我想见见狮子。”

刚才那会儿，马车夫一直在试图吸引草莓的目光。终于，他成功了。“嗨，草莓，老伙计，”他说，“你认得俺。你可不能往那儿一站就不认俺了呀。”

“那玩意儿叽里咕噜在说什么呢，马兄弟？”几个声音问。

“唉，”草莓慢条斯理地说，“我不太清楚。我看我们中大多数对什么事都不大了解。不过我总觉得以前在哪里见过类似这种玩意儿。我老是有种感觉，觉得从前住在别的什么地方——或者说，从前我是别的什么东西——可就在几分钟前，阿斯兰唤醒了我们。就像做梦一样，昏昏沉沉的，但有三个很像他们的玩意儿出现在那个梦里。”

“什么？”马车夫说，“你不认识俺啦？没有俺，你犯病那会儿谁伺候你吃上一顿热乎乎的晚餐的？没有俺，谁给你擦洗鬃毛？每次你站在冷冰冰的地方，谁从不忘记给你盖上点什么？真没想到你会变成这样，草莓。”

“真的有过这些事，”马儿若有所思地说。“是啊，让我想想，好好想想。对了，你过去老是把一个可怕的黑漆漆的东西绑在我的背后，然后鞭打着我让我往前跑。不管我跑多远，那个黑漆漆的东西都一直在我身后哐啷哐啷地拖着。”

“咱得挣钱过日子呀，”马车夫说，“咱俩都是一样的命。要是不干活儿，或者不挨鞭子，就不会有马厩和干草，也不会有麦糊和燕麦。只有俺有钱买燕麦了，你才能够尝到一点儿。这没啥好否认的。”

“燕麦？”马儿竖起了耳朵。“对了，我记起那东西来了。是的，我记起越来越多的事了。你以前总是高高地坐在我背后的一个地方，而我总在前面跑，拉着你和那个黑漆漆的东西。我知道所有的活儿都是我干的。”

“只有在夏天，我承认，”马车夫说，“你干着所有的活儿，而俺可以坐着凉快。可到了冬天呢，老伙计，那会儿你就浑身暖和了，而俺坐在那儿，脚冻得跟冰块儿似的，鼻子都要让风给刮掉了，手也冻得很僵，都抓不住缰绳了。”

“那地方太惨了，日子真过不下去，”草莓说。“那里没有草，全是硬邦邦的石头。”

“太对了，伙计，太对了！”马车夫说。“真是个要命的地方。俺老是讲，那些铺路石不适合在上面跑马。伦敦就那样子，俺和你一样不喜欢伦敦。你是匹乡下马，俺是个乡下佬。俺过去老在老家的唱诗班里唱歌，可在老家，俺没法活下去啊。”

“哦，对不起，对不起，”迪格雷说，“咱们继续前进好吗？狮子走得越来越远了，我真的太想跟它说说话了。”

“嗨，听俺说，草莓，”马车夫说，“这位小少爷心里头有些话想对狮子说，就是你们的阿斯兰。你驮着他去找狮子吧，他会乐意的。俺和这小丫头在后面跟着。”

“驮着他？”草莓说。“哦，我想起来了，就是骑在我的背上。我记得很久以前，常有一个小家伙，像你这样长着两条腿的，骑在我的背上。他常给我吃一种硬硬的白色的小方块，那东西吃起来——哦，美极了，要比草甜得多。”

“啊，那是糖，”马车夫说。

“请吧，草莓，”迪格雷央求着说，“快，让我骑上去吧，带我去找阿斯兰。”

“行，我不介意，”马儿说，“就驮你一次吧，上来。”

“好样的，老草莓，”马车夫说。“来，小伙子，让俺托你一把。”迪格雷很快骑上了草莓，他感到舒服极了，因为他以前只骑过自己那匹小马驹的光背。

“驾，出发，草莓！”他喊道。

“我看，你身上没带那种白色的好吃的东西吧？”马儿问。

“好像没带，”迪格雷说。

“好吧，这也没办法，”草莓边说边撒开蹄子跑了起来。

就在这时，一只大公狗嗅了好一阵子，又盯着瞧了好一会儿，接着喊了起来：

“瞧，那里不是还有一个这种奇怪的玩意儿吗？——在那儿，河边上，树底下。”

动物们都朝着那边望去，它们看见安德鲁舅舅一动不动地立在杜鹃花丛中，生怕被人发现。

“来吧！”几个声音说。“我们过去看看。”这会儿，草莓正驮着迪格雷轻快地朝一个方向奔去（波莉和马车夫步行跟在后面），而大多数动物正奔向安德鲁舅舅，它们吼着、吠着、哼哼着，满心好奇地发出各种各样欢快的声音。

现在，我们得回过头去从安德鲁舅舅的角度解释一下事情的原原本本了。这些事情留给他的印象跟留给马车夫和孩子们的印象完全不同，因为一个人的所见所闻大致取决于他所处的立场，也取决于他是一个什么样的人。

动物们一出现，安德鲁舅舅就一步一步地往后退，最后缩到灌木丛里去了。当然，他也仔细地观察着它们；不过他对它们在干些什么事情不感兴趣，他关心的是它们会不会朝自己冲过来。跟女巫一样，他极其现实。他压根儿没注意到阿斯兰从每一种野兽里挑出了一对；他看见的，或自以为看见的，只是许许多多危险的野兽在他眼前晃来晃去。而且他一直在纳闷，为什么还有一些动物不从那头巨狮身边跑开呢。

当野兽们开口讲话那一伟大时刻来临时，安德鲁舅舅却错过了，其中原因，说起来十分可笑。狮子开始唱歌时，还是很久以前天还漆黑那会儿，他也意识到那声音是一首歌，可是他很不喜欢那首歌，这使他想起了不愉快的事情，并使他浑身不对劲儿。后来，太阳升起来了，他看见唱歌的是一头狮子（“不过是一头狮子，”他自言自语地说），于是便使劲让自己相信它不是在唱歌，也从来没唱过歌——它只不过像我们世界的动物园里的狮子那样吼叫着。“它当然不可能唱歌，”他想，“那只是我的幻觉，我一定是神经错乱啦。有谁听见过狮子唱歌呢？”狮子越这么唱下去，唱得越动听，他就越发让自己相信他听到的只不过是吼叫。要命的是，只要一个人想把自己变得更加愚蠢，他十有八九能够成功。安德鲁舅舅就是这样。要不了一会儿，他就从阿斯兰的歌声中只听见吼叫了，即使他想听，也听不出别的声音了。最后，当狮子开口说“纳尼亚，醒来吧”的时候，他一个字儿也没有听到：他听到的只是一声咆哮。当野兽们跟阿斯兰说话时，他也只听见一阵汪汪、嗷嗷的叫唤。而当它们开口大笑时——嗯，你能想象那笑声，这对安德鲁舅舅来说可就是至今发生的最可怕的事情了。一群饥饿而愤怒的野兽，发出这么一阵杀气腾腾的恐怖吼叫，他这一辈子都没听见过。后来，他看到那三个人朝空地里走去，加入了动物们的队伍，这使他又气又怕。

“一群蠢货！”他自言自语着。“这下，那群畜生会把这两个孩子连同戒指一块儿吞掉的，我再也回不去了。迪格雷这小鬼真自私！其他几个也不是好东西。要是他们觉得活腻了，那是他们自个儿的事，可叫我怎么办呢？他们好像从没考虑过，从来就没有人替我着想过。”

最后，一大群动物朝他冲了过来，他赶紧转身逃命。这会儿，谁都看得出，那个年轻世界的空气确实对这位老先生大有好处。在伦敦，他已经老得跑不动了，可按他这会儿跑步的速度，在英格兰任何一个预备学校都能拿下百米赛的冠军。他礼服的后摆在身后甩来甩去，倒是一道有趣的风景。不过，他跑得再快也不顶用。追着他的动物中有不少是跑步健将，而这又是它们有生以来第一次奔跑，因此都想试试它们的新肌肉。“快追！追上他！”它们喊叫着。“他弄不好就是那个什么‘伊佛儿’！嗬！快跑！截住他！把他给围起来！加油！快！”

几分钟后，一些动物赶上了他，它们排成一列截住了他，其他动物又包抄了过来。他环顾四周，朝哪儿看都吓一大跳。他一抬头，便看见巨大的麋鹿高耸着角；大象探着它那张庞大的脸；他的身后，笨重的熊和野猪板着脸，呼哧呼哧地叫着；神情冷漠的豹子甩着尾巴，幸灾乐祸地（他是这么想的）盯着他。最使他心惊肉跳的是那么多的血盆大口。其实动物们张大嘴巴是为了喘气，他却认为它们要张嘴吞了他。

安德鲁舅舅东摇西晃地站在那里，浑身发抖。他一直就对动物们十分恐惧，即便在他威风的时候，也不喜欢它们；长年累月地用动物做残忍的实验自然使他越发憎恨和害怕它们。

“请问，先生，”那条公狗用处理公事的口吻问，“你究竟是动物，是植物，还是矿物呢？”它一字一句地说出这话，可在安德鲁舅舅听来只是“汪——汪——汪！”的叫声。

(1) 动物们不知阿斯兰所说的“邪恶（evil）”为何意，以为这“evil”是一种什么动物的名称。





第十一章　迪格雷和他舅舅陷入困境


你可能会认为这些动物都非常愚蠢，不能一眼看出安德鲁舅舅和两个孩子以及马车夫属于同一个物种。可你别忘了，动物们对衣服是一无所知的。它们觉得，波莉的裙衫、迪格雷的夹克以及马车夫的圆顶礼帽，就像它们自己的皮毛和羽翼一样，是身体的一部分。要不是它们与这三个人谈了话，而且草莓也似乎觉得他们应该是同类，它们才不会相信呢。再说了，安德鲁舅舅要比孩子们高得多，但又比马车夫瘦得多，除了那件白马甲（这会儿可没那么白了），他穿了一身黑。而且，安德鲁舅舅的满头灰发（这会儿已经乱蓬蓬的了），在动物们看来，与其他三个人身上的东西没一点相似。因此，它们自然就感到迷惑了。最糟糕的是，他好像还不会说话。

他曾想法说话。当公狗对他开口时（在他看来，那或许只是咆哮，接着又是咕哝），他伸出一只颤抖的手，气喘吁吁地说：“好汪汪，唉，可怜的老伙计。”但动物们听不懂他的话，正如他也听不懂动物们的话一样。它们听见的不是字与词，而是含混不清的咝咝声。也许还是听不懂的好，因为我从没见过哪条狗愿意被人喊作“好汪汪”，就像你也不愿意被人叫作“我的小鬼”一样，更不用说那是条纳尼亚的会说话的狗了。

后来，安德鲁舅舅晕了过去，一头栽倒在地上。

“啊呀！”一头野猪说。“它原来是一棵树。我一直这么觉得。”（要知道，它们还从未见过谁晕倒，甚至连摔倒都没见过呢。）

那只公狗将安德鲁舅舅全身嗅了个遍，抬头说：“他是动物，肯定是动物，还很可能跟那几个是同类。”

“我看未必，”一头熊说，“动物不会那样子倒在地上缩成一团。我们是动物，我们就从不缩在地上。我们站着，就像这样。”它说着用后腿立了起来，向后走了一步，不料在一根低矮的树枝上绊了一跤，摔了个四脚朝天。

“第三个笑柄，第三个笑柄，第三个笑柄！”那只寒鸦无比激动地叫了起来。

“我还是觉得是一种什么树，”野猪说。

“要是树的话，”另一头熊说，“上面就会有蜂窝。”

“我敢肯定它不是一棵树，”一头獾说，“我总觉得它倒下前想说些什么。”

“那只是风吹过枝叶的响声，”野猪说。

“你的意思很明显，”寒鸦对獾说，“你不觉得它是头会说话的动物！它一个字也没说。”

“不过，你们看，”大象说话了（当然是大象夫人，你应该记得，她的丈夫被阿斯兰叫走了），“你们看，它有可能是某种动物。这一端那块白白的东西不正是脸吗？那些洞不正是眼睛和嘴吗？当然，没有鼻子。不过——哎呀——不要太计较了。咱们动物当中，那种真正能称得上鼻子的东西，只有极少数才有。”它斜着眼欣赏起自己那长长的鼻子，难怪它流露出扬扬得意的神态。

“我强烈反对这种说法，”公狗反驳。

“大象说得没错，”貘说。

“让我来告诉你们吧！”驴子机敏地说。“也许它是一种不会说话但又觉得自己会说话的动物。”

“能让它站起来吗？”大象关切地问。它伸出鼻子将安德鲁舅舅柔软的身体轻轻一卷，竖了起来；但不幸头朝下了。于是，两枚面值半英镑的金币、三枚面值半克朗和一枚面值六便士的硬币从他口袋里滚落了下来。可是这不管用，安德鲁舅舅还是倒了下去。

“瞧！”几个声音说。“它根本不是动物，它不是活的。”

“我告诉你们，它真的是动物，”公狗说，“你们自己闻闻吧！”

“气味并不能说明一切，”大象说。

“可是，”公狗说，“谁要是连自己的鼻子都不相信，那还能相信什么？”

“大概，要相信脑袋吧，”大象心平气和地答。

“我强烈反对这种说法，”公狗反驳。

“好啦，我们必须采取行动，”大象说。“弄不好它就是那什么‘伊佛儿’，得把它带去见阿斯兰。大家伙儿是怎么想的？它是动物呢，还是某一种树呢？”

“树！树！”十几个声音异口同声地回答。

“好，”大象说，“那么，它要是树的话，就一定想栽进土里。我们来挖个洞吧。”

两只鼹鼠很快就完成了任务。而对于把安德鲁舅舅的哪一头栽进去，动物们产生了分歧，他弄不好就得头朝下被栽到土里了。有几个动物说他的腿一定是树枝，因此，那团灰灰的毛茸茸的东西（说的是他的头）就一定是树根了。可是其他动物又说，叉开的那一端沾了更多的泥土，而且伸得更长些，根就应该是那样儿。所以，最后他还是被直立着栽进了土里。填回土并拍实后，土刚好没过了他的膝盖。

“它好像快枯死了，”驴子说。

“当然得给它浇点儿水了，”大象说。“要我说嘛（不是要冒犯在场的各位），也许，要搞定这项工作，非得我这样的鼻子才行……”

“我强烈反对这种说法，”公狗反驳说。但大象默默地走到河边，用鼻子吸满了水，又折回来，对着安德鲁舅舅洒了一通。这机灵的动物不断地洒着，他被浇了不知有多少水，水顺着他礼服的边儿淌了下来，他就像穿着衣服冲了个澡一样。终于，这一通猛洒使他从昏迷中清醒了过来。总算是让他清醒了啊！不过我们得让他一个人思思过（如果他还有良心的话），接下来，我们要讲一些更重要的事情。

草莓驮着迪格雷，一路小跑着前进，把其他动物的喧闹渐渐甩在了身后，这会儿，他们离阿斯兰和它选出来的那个智囊团已经不远了。迪格雷明白他不能打扰这样一场神圣而庄严的会议，而且也没有必要。阿斯兰说了句什么，公象、渡鸦以及其他所有的动物都四散而去。迪格雷跨下马，迎面撞见了阿斯兰。阿斯兰比他想象的更庞大、更美丽，浑身更加金亮，也更加可怕。他都不敢注视它那对炯炯有神的眼睛了。

“对不起——狮子先生——阿斯兰——阁下，”迪格雷说，“能不能——让我斗胆——请您，请您赐我一些这里的神奇果子，来治好我妈妈的病呢？”

他急切盼望狮子说“好的”，又非常害怕它会说“不”。可是，狮子既没说“好”，也没说“不”，这使他着实吃了一惊。

“就是这个男孩，”阿斯兰都没朝迪格雷瞥上一眼，而是看着它那个智囊团，说，“就是这个男孩干的。”

“哦，我的天哪，”迪格雷心想，“我到底干了什么呀？”

“亚当之子啊，”狮子说，“有个来自异域的邪恶的女巫，她闯入了我的纳尼亚这片崭新的国土，告诉这些善良的动物，她是怎么到这儿来的。”

他能讲述的事情真是太多太多啦，都一股脑儿涌向了他的脑海。不过他的头脑还很清醒，知道不该说的不说，该说的就实话实说。

“是我把她带来的，阿斯兰，”他低声回答。

“为什么呢？”

“我不想她留在我们的世界，想把她撵回她自己的世界去。我还以为我把她带回了她自己的世界了呢。”

“她是怎么去了你们的世界的，亚当之子？”

“靠——靠的是魔法。”

狮子沉默不语了。迪格雷知道自己讲得还不够详细。

“是我的舅舅，阿斯兰，”他说，“他用魔法戒指使我们离开自己的世界，不管怎样，我是不得不去的，因为他先把波莉给送去了。后来，我们在一个叫恰恩的地方遇到了那女巫，她紧紧抓住了我们，这时候——”

“你们遇到了女巫？”阿斯兰低沉的嗓音像是威胁的咆哮。

“她醒了过来，”迪格雷可怜巴巴地说；接着，他的脸色刷白了，“我是说，我唤醒了她。因为我想知道敲响了钟会有什么事情发生。波莉不愿意这么干，这也不能怪她。我——我还跟她动了手。我知道这么做不应该。我想，是钟下面的文字让我有点儿着魔了。”

“真的吗？”阿斯兰问道，嗓音依旧十分低沉。

“不是的，”迪格雷说，“我现在明白了，那不是原因。我只是在找借口。”

大家沉默了好一会儿。迪格雷一直在想：“我把事情全搞砸了。现在已经没机会为妈妈要到任何东西了。”

狮子又一次开口了，但不是对着迪格雷说的。

“看见了吧，朋友们，”它说，“我给了你们这个崭新而洁净的世界还不到七小时，一股邪恶的力量就已经闯了进来；是这个亚当之子把它唤醒，并带到这里来的。”那些野兽，甚至包括草莓，都把目光转向了迪格雷，他真恨不得被一口吞到大地的肚子里去。“不过，不要沮丧，”阿斯兰对着野兽们说。“那个恶魔将带来邪恶，不过为时尚早，我会留神让最坏的事情都降临到我自己头上。此刻，让我们建立一种秩序，使这里成为天国的一片乐土，持续好几百年。虽然亚当的种族带来了灾祸，但也将帮助我们消除灾祸。过来，你们另外两位。”

最后一句话是对波莉和马车夫说的，他们刚刚赶到这里。波莉目瞪口呆地盯着阿斯兰，并把马车夫的手抓得紧紧的。马车夫瞥了狮子一眼，摘下他的圆顶礼帽；谁也没有见过他不戴帽子的模样，他摘了帽子倒更显得年轻英俊了，看起来更像个乡下人，而不像是伦敦的马车夫。

“孩子，”阿斯兰对马车夫说，“我很早就认识你了，你认识我吗？”

“呃，不认识，老爷，”马车夫说。“不过嘛，话也不能这么说。俺总有些觉得，恕俺直言，咱俩以前还真认识呢。”

“很好，”狮子说，“你自己也想不到你会知道那么多事情。你会越来越了解我的。你喜欢这片土地吗？”

“这真是片乐土啊，老爷，”马车夫说。

“你想永远住在这里吗？”

“呃，您看，老爷，俺都是成了家的人啦，”马车夫说，“要是俺老伴能和俺一道，估计谁也不想再回伦敦了。俺们都是地地道道的乡下人。”

阿斯兰猛然昂起它那毛发粗密的头，张开嘴，发出一声长长的嚎叫；不很响亮，但充满力量。波莉听得心怦怦直跳。她觉得，那肯定是一种呼唤，只要听到这声呼唤，不论远隔多少世界、多少年代，谁都乐意听从，并且都能够听从。因此，当一个面容和善又老实的年轻妇人，不知打哪儿一脚跨到她的面前时，她虽满心觉得好奇，却并没有被吓着或惊着。波莉马上反应了过来，她就是马车夫的妻子。她倒不是靠什么该死的魔法戒指从我们的世界里被弄过去的，而是像一只小鸟儿一样，轻快、自然、愉悦地回到了巢里。这位年轻的妇人系着围裙，袖子挽到了胳膊肘上，手上还沾着肥皂泡呢，显然那天她正在洗衣服。要是有时间换上一身好衣服（她最好的帽子上镶着樱桃样子的装饰），她看上去准不会那么讨人喜欢；现在这模样，让人瞧着反而相当舒服。

她自然以为自己是在做梦呢，所以也就没有马上奔到丈夫身边，询问他这到底是怎么回事儿。然而她一看见狮子，就懵了，不明白自己到底是不是在做梦。可不知什么原因，她似乎也不十分害怕。然后，她微微鞠了一躬，那年头，农村姑娘们还知道怎样行这种礼。接着，她走了过去，拉住马车夫的手，站在那里，羞答答地打量着四周。

“我的孩子们，”阿斯兰凝视着马车夫夫妇说，“你们将是纳尼亚第一位国王和王后。”

马车夫惊得合不拢嘴，他妻子的脸腾的一下红了。

“你们将统治这里所有的生灵，并给它们取名字。你要在它们当中施行正义，在敌人入侵时保卫它们的安全。敌人就要来啦，因为已经有一个邪恶的女巫闯入了这个世界。”

马车夫用力咽了几次口水，清了清嗓子。

“请您原谅，老爷，”他说，“真的非常感谢您（俺老伴也万分感激），可俺不是干那事儿的料。俺没啥文化，您也应该看得出来了吧。”

“那么，”阿斯兰说，“你会使用铲子和犁吗？知道怎样在地里种庄稼吗？”

“没问题，老爷，可以干一些，俺打小就干这种活儿。”

“你能仁慈并且公正地统治这儿的生灵吗？你可要记住，它们跟你出生的那个世界里的野兽可不一样，它们会说话，它们不是奴隶，而是自由的臣民。”

“记住了，老爷，”马车夫答道，“俺会尽量公正地对待它们。”

“你会教育你的子子孙孙也这么做吗？”

“俺尽力去做吧，老爷。俺会尽全力的，是吧，蕾丽？”

“你不会在你的儿女中或其他动物中有偏心，或让一些压制、奴役另一些吧？”

“俺决不容忍这种事儿发生，老爷，真的。要是谁干出这种事儿来被俺逮住，俺绝饶不了他，”马车夫说。（谈着谈着，马车夫越说越慢，中气却越说越足，那嗓音听起来更像他小时候在乡下时一般，而不像他当马车夫那会儿又尖又急。）

“要是有敌人侵犯这块土地（因为敌人就要来了），战斗打响的话，你会冲锋在前，撤退在后吗？”

“嗯，老爷，”马车夫缓缓地说，“一个人不经历患难就不能真正认识自己。俺承认自己还是属于那种性格温和的人，打架最多只敢使使拳头。但俺会努力的——就是说，俺希望努力——尽俺的职责。”

“很好，”阿斯兰说，“你将履行一个国王的职责。你的加冕仪式即将举行。你和你的子孙将被赐福，有的将成为纳尼亚的国王，有的将成为南山那边阿钦兰的国王。还有你，这位小姑娘（他转向波莉），我们欢迎你。在被施了咒的恰恩城那个废殿的塑像厅里，这位小男孩伤了你，你已经原谅他了吗？”

“是的，阿斯兰，我们握手言和了，”波莉说。

“很好，”阿斯兰说，“现在，该轮到这个男孩了。”





第十二章　草莓历险记


迪格雷紧紧咬着嘴唇，越来越感到不安了。他希望，不论发生什么，都不要哭，也不要干出傻事儿来。

“亚当之子，”阿斯兰说，“在我纳尼亚王国这片乐土诞生之日，你犯下了错，现在准备弥补吗？”

“可是，我不知道该怎么做，”迪格雷说。“您看，那女巫已经逃跑了，而且——”

“我问的是，你准备去弥补吗？”狮子说。

“是的，”迪格雷回答。有那么一瞬，他脑中闪现出一个疯狂的念头，想说“您要是答应救我妈妈的命，我就尽力帮您”，不过他马上意识到，是不可以跟狮子讨价还价的。可是，刚才回答“是”的时候，他想起了妈妈，想起了曾有过的那么宏伟的愿望，可如今都灰飞烟灭了。想到这里，他的喉咙哽咽了，双眼噙满了泪水，禁不住脱口而出：

“行行好吧，行行好——请您——您能不能给我点儿什么，让我治好妈妈的病？”他之前一直注视着狮子粗壮的脚掌和巨大的爪子；这会儿，在绝望之下，他抬起头凝视着它的脸。他看到了这辈子最令他惊奇的事儿。狮子低下它那张黄褐色的脸，凑到他面前，（最令人奇怪的是）它的眼里闪烁着大颗大颗晶莹的泪珠，与迪格雷的泪珠相比是那么大，那么亮。他顿时觉得，狮子似乎比他自己还为他妈妈感到伤心。

“我的孩子，我的孩子啊，”阿斯兰说，“我知道，这简直太令人伤心了。在这片土地上，只有咱俩能够体会。让我们互助互爱吧。可是，我要为纳尼亚数百年的命运着想。你带到这个世界来的那个女巫将重返纳尼亚，不过她暂时还不会回来。我希望在纳尼亚栽一棵她不敢靠近的树，那棵树将保卫纳尼亚许多年不受她的侵犯。因此，在乌云蔽日之前，这片土地将会迎来一个漫长而灿烂的早晨。你得为我去取树种。”

“遵命，阁下，”迪格雷说。他虽然不知道该怎么办，但这会儿却坚信自己能够办到。狮子深深地吸了口气，将头垂得更低了，垂到他脸上时给了他一个吻。迪格雷立刻感到他的身体里注入了新的力量和勇气。

“亲爱的孩子，”阿斯兰说，“我会告诉你该怎么做的。回头往西看，告诉我，你看见了什么？”

“我看见了巍峨的群山，阿斯兰，”迪格雷说。“我还看见有一条河奔下悬崖形成一座瀑布。悬崖之外，是苍翠的高高山林。山林之外，是黑沉沉的更为高峻的山脉。在更远处，巨大的雪山连绵不绝——像是照片上的阿尔卑斯山。雪山的后面，除了天空什么也没有。”

“你看得很清楚，”狮子说，“奔流直下的瀑布就是纳尼亚国土的边界，你一旦到了悬崖顶上，就出了纳尼亚的国界，进入西方的荒蛮之地了。你必须长途跋涉越过那些高山，最后你会找到一个冰山环抱的青翠峡谷，那里有一个碧蓝的湖泊。湖的一面，有一座陡峭的青山，山顶有一个花园，花园中央种着一棵树，你从树上摘一个苹果，把它带回来给我。”

“遵命，阁下，”迪格雷又这样说。其实他压根儿不知道如何爬上悬崖，也不知道怎样才能在崇山峻岭中不迷失方向，可他又不愿意说，生怕听上去像是在找借口。但是他还是说：“阿斯兰，我希望，您不是急着要。我去了那里一时半会儿可是回不来的。”

“年轻的亚当之子啊，你会得到帮助的，”阿斯兰说完，转向了那匹马。它一直静悄悄地站在他们身边，一边甩着尾巴驱赶苍蝇，一边歪着头听他们说话，好像他们谈的内容有点儿费解似的。

“我亲爱的，”阿斯兰对马说道，“你愿意成为一匹飞马吗？”

你真该看看当时那匹马是怎样甩着鬣毛，张着鼻孔，一只后蹄嗒嗒踩着地面的。显然，它十分乐意成为一匹飞马。但它只是这样说：

“如果您希望，阿斯兰——您要是真的想——我不明白为啥选中我——我可不是一匹很机灵的马。”

“生出翅膀吧，所有飞马都称你为父，”阿斯兰大吼一声，吼声震地，“我给你取名叫弗兰奇。”

那匹马吓得缩了回去，在以前拉车的苦难岁月里，它经常会受到这种惊吓。接着，它嘶叫了一声，扭着脖子，好像有只苍蝇叮着它的肩膀，它想扭过头去挠痒痒似的。不一会儿，像是动物们先前从土里冒出来一样，弗兰奇的肩上突然冒出一对翅膀，翅膀铺展开去，越长越大，超过了鹰的翅膀，超过了天鹅的翅膀，最后超过了教堂窗户上天使的翅膀。翅羽闪耀着栗色和铜色的光泽。它猛一展翅，跃到了空中，在阿斯兰和迪格雷头顶二十英尺来高的空中打着响鼻，嘶鸣着，腾跃着。围着他们飞了一圈后，它降落了下来，四蹄一齐落地，姿势看上去还有点儿笨拙。它好像很惊讶，但又十分欣喜。

“还行吧，弗兰奇？”阿斯兰问。

“太棒了，阿斯兰，”弗兰奇说。

“你愿意驮着这位年轻的亚当之子，带他去往我说的那个山谷吗？”

“什么？这会儿？立马就去？”草莓问——不过，我们现在得叫它弗兰奇了——“快！骑上来吧，小东西，我以前驮过你这样的东西，那是在很久以前了，那会儿有绿油油的田野，还有糖块儿呢。”

“这两位夏娃的女儿在交头接耳说些什么呢？”阿斯兰说，突然转向了波莉和马车夫的妻子，她俩显然已经交上了朋友。

“要是您愿意的话，阁下，”海伦王后（现在该这么称呼马车夫的妻子蕾丽了）说，“我看这位小姑娘也想跟着去，如果这不误事的话。”

“不知道弗兰奇意下如何？”狮子问。

“噢，我不介意驮俩，驮这俩小家伙更是不在话下，”弗兰奇说，“不过我希望大象不要跟着爬上来。”

大象可没想上去。纳尼亚的新国王帮着两个孩子上了马背：他随手一举，先将迪格雷举了上去；又将波莉轻手轻脚地扶上马背，把她当成个易碎的瓷娃娃似的。“他俩都坐稳啦，草莓——弗兰奇，俺从今以后该这么叫你了。前路莫测呀。”

“别飞得太高，”阿斯兰叮嘱着，“不要硬去飞越巨大的冰山的顶峰。要留意着山谷，那是些绿油油的地带，从那里穿越过去。上路吧，我祝你们一路平安。”

“嗬，弗兰奇！”迪格雷边说边弯下腰，拍了拍马儿光亮的脖子。“太好玩了。抓紧我，波莉。”

不一会儿，那片土地就被他们远远地抛在了下面。弗兰奇盘旋了一两圈，宛如一只巨大的鸽子，大地似乎也跟着旋转了起来。然后，它向西飞去，开始了漫长的征程。波莉向下望去，几乎看不见国王和王后了，连阿斯兰也只是碧草中一个醒目的黄点。风立刻扑面而来。弗兰奇稳稳地拍打着翅膀。

纳尼亚在他们脚下展现出了全貌。草地、岩石、石南花以及各种各样的树木将大地点缀得五彩缤纷，还有一条河流，宛如一条水银的带子蜿蜒而去。右边，是一列连绵向北的低矮山丘，他们的目光越过山顶，看见山外边有一片巨大的沼泽，随地势缓缓升高，一直铺展到天边。左边的山脉更为高峻，但时不时露出一个山凹，从那里望过去，透过挺拔的松林，能瞥见南方的土地，湛蓝而又辽阔。

“那儿想必就是阿钦兰吧，”波莉说。

“是的，看前面！”迪格雷说。

突然，悬崖在他们面前竖起了一道巨大的屏障。地势向西逐渐升高，西边的高地上河流汇聚成一座巨大的瀑布，呼啸着跌入纳尼亚境内，水花飞溅。阳光在瀑布上舞动着，刺得他们目眩。他们在高空中翱翔着，在那高度，瀑布的轰鸣听起来不过是细微的响动。不过，他们还飞得不够高，还不能飞越那些悬崖的顶峰。

“我们要在这里走一阵‘之’字形路线了，”弗兰奇说，“抓紧喽。”

它开始左一程右一程地前进，一次比一次飞得高。空气越来越凛冽了，鹰在他们脚下很远处叫唤着。

“大家注意，朝后看！在你们身后！”波莉喊道。

他们朝那边望去，只见纳尼亚的峡谷向东一直延伸到地平线的尽头，那儿有一片晶莹的大海。从他们现在的高度望下去，西北方沼泽外参差的群山显得格外渺小，平原像沙漠一般广袤，铺展向遥远的南方。

“希望有人能告诉我们那儿是什么地方，”迪格雷说。

“我看那儿还算不上什么地方，”波莉说。“我的意思是，那儿没有人，也没有发生过任何事情，那个世界今天才开始。”

“不能这么说，总会有人到那里去的，”迪格雷说。“你看，那样一来，就会有历史了。”

“咳，幸好还没有，”波莉说，“因为没人能真正懂得历史。满纸的战争、年代，一大堆这样的废话。”

这会儿，他们已飞临悬崖之巅，不一会儿，纳尼亚山谷就被他们甩在身后，从他们的视野中消失了。他们依旧沿着河流飞行，下面是一片荒原，到处都是陡峭的山坡和黑漆漆的树林。巍峨的群山在前方若隐若现。然而阳光迎面射来，使他们看不清前方的景物。因为太阳正在慢慢下山，到最后，西边的天空像是铺满了熔化的黄金，成了一只巨大的熔炉。终于，夕阳在一排参差的山峰背后沉没了，在夕阳余晖的映衬下，挺立的山峰仿佛一张清晰而平坦的剪影。

“这儿不怎么暖和，”波莉说。

“我的翅膀开始酸了，”弗兰奇说，“阿斯兰说的那个有湖的山谷还不见踪影。何不下去找一个舒服的地方过了夜再说？今晚我们是甭想到达目的地了。”

“好吧，现在也该吃晚饭了吧？”迪格雷说。

于是，弗兰奇越飞越低。当他们靠近大地，飞临小山丘时，空气暖和了起来。经历了好几小时的漫长飞行，一路上除了弗兰奇扇动翅膀的声音，什么也听不见，现在又听见了亲切而熟悉的声音，他们别提有多高兴了。流水潺潺，拍打着河床的石头；微风飒飒，吹拂着林中的树木。泥土、青草和鲜花在太阳的炙烤下散发着一股暖烘烘的香气，朝他们扑鼻而来。弗兰奇终于着陆了。迪格雷翻下马背，又扶波莉爬了下来。他俩都很高兴总算能舒展一下僵硬的腿脚了。

他们降落的那个山谷正好处在群山中心，抬头只见积雪覆盖着群山，其中一座在夕阳的余晖中披上了一层玫瑰红。

“我饿了，”迪格雷说。

“来吧，尽情地吃吧，”弗兰奇说着，咬了一大口青草嚼了起来。它不停地嚼着，嘴角两边像长了胡子似的戳出东一根西一根的草来。过了一会儿，它抬起头说：“来呀，你们俩，别不好意思，这儿的草够咱们吃的。”

“可是我们不吃草，”迪格雷说。

“哼哧，哼哧，”弗兰奇嚼着满嘴的草，说道，“唉——哼哧——真不知道你们想怎么样。多好的草呀。”

波莉和迪格雷只能无奈地面面相觑。

“我想，一定有人给我们准备好了晚饭，”迪格雷说。

“你们去恳求一下阿斯兰吧，我想它肯定会为你们准备好的，”弗兰奇说。

“不恳求它就不知道吗？”波莉问。

“它肯定知道的，”马儿说（嘴里仍大口嚼着草），“不过，我总觉得它喜欢别人恳求它。”

“那我们到底该怎么办好呢？”迪格雷问。

“我怎么知道，”弗兰奇说，“除非你们尝尝这草，弄不好比你们想象的要好吃。”

“唉，别说傻话了，”波莉跺着脚嚷道，“人当然没法儿吃草，就像你也不吃羊排。”

“看在上帝分上，别提什么羊排了，”迪格雷说道，“越提事情越糟。”

迪格雷对波莉说，她最好戴上戒指回家，然后取些吃的回来；他自己不能去，因为他答应过阿斯兰要直接去完成任务的，要是又回了家，弄不好就给什么事耽搁住了。可是，波莉说她是不会抛下他的，迪格雷说她真是太够意思了。

“啊哈，”波莉说，“我还有一袋太妃糖没吃完呢，搁在外套口袋里。总比没吃的强吧。”

“强太多啦，”迪格雷说，“但把手伸进去掏的时候可要小心，别碰着戒指。”

这事可不那么好办，不过他们终于还是成功了。那一小袋糖最后从口袋里掏出来时，纸袋软趴趴黏糊糊的，所以，要把糖从纸袋上撕下来可比从口袋里把糖掏出来难得多啦。有些大人（你可见识过他们遇上这等事儿时的脾气），宁愿不吃晚饭饿肚子，也不愿吃那些太妃糖。他们数了一下，一共九颗糖。还是迪格雷想出了一个好点子，每人吃四颗，然后将第九颗种在土里。他说：“从灯柱上拧下来的铁棍都能长成一棵小小的灯柱树，那么凭什么这颗糖不会长成一棵太妃糖树呢？”于是，他们在草地上挖了一个很小的洞，把那颗太妃糖埋了进去。埋好后，他们吃起了剩下的那八颗糖，他们细嚼慢咽，生怕它化得太快。那顿晚饭实在是太糟糕了，可他们恨不得连糖带纸一块儿吞下去。

弗兰奇吃完它那顿丰盛的晚餐后躺了下来。孩子们走到它跟前，一边一个，坐下来靠着它温暖的身体。它铺开翅膀一边盖住一个，他们觉得又暖和又舒适。这时候，明亮而年轻的星星在这个崭新的世界里升了起来，他们谈起了心里话：迪格雷当时希望能找到什么东西来治好他妈妈的病，可后来，却被派去执行了这项任务。他们一再地谈起他们要找的那个地方的特征——湛蓝的湖泊，山顶有座花园的小丘。他们谈着谈着，速度慢了下来，终于觉得困了。突然，波莉惊醒了，一下子坐了起来，嘴里发出“嘘！”的一声。

大家都集中精神侧耳倾听。

“也许只是一阵风吹过了树林吧，”迪格雷随口说。

“我不敢肯定，”弗兰奇说，“不管怎样——等等！又来了。阿斯兰在上，是有动静。”

马儿腾的一下站了起来，巨大的身体往上一耸，发出很大的声响。孩子们也已经爬起来了。弗兰奇来来回回地小跑着，嘶鸣着，嗅嗅这儿，嗅嗅那儿。孩子们蹑手蹑脚地走到东，走到西，在每一丛灌木和每一棵树背后查探着。他们总觉得看见了什么。有一回，波莉十分肯定自己看到一个高大的黑影迅速朝西面溜去。但他们什么也没有找到。最后，弗兰奇又躺了下来，孩子们又偎依（如果可以这么说的话）在马的翅膀下，很快就睡着了。弗兰奇好长时间一直醒着，在黑暗中一忽儿前一忽儿后地摆动着它的耳朵，还时不时打个寒战，似乎有只苍蝇落在了它的身上。但最后，它还是睡着了。





第十三章　不期而遇


“醒醒，迪格雷；醒醒，弗兰奇，”波莉喊了起来。“它居然真的长成一棵太妃糖树啦。这是最美好的早晨。”

朝阳才刚升起，阳光已洒满树林了，青草披上了一层灰白的露珠，蛛网上银光闪耀。就在他们身旁，长出了一棵小小的颜色深暗的树，与苹果树一般大小。它舒展着白白的纸片似的叶子，很像一种叫作缎花的植物，上面还挂满了像枣一样的褐色小果子。

“万岁！”迪格雷嚷了起来。“不过我要先去洗个澡。”他急忙穿过几丛开满花的灌木来到了河边。阳光下，这条河急急地流过红色、蓝色和黄色的石头，形成一股股湍急的洪流。你曾在这样的山间小河里洗过澡吗？这感觉跟在大海里一样美妙，某些方面甚至还要棒呢。当然，他只好不等身子干透就穿上了衣服，但即便这样也相当值得。他回来后，波莉也去那里洗了个澡；至少她说她那是洗澡，但据我们所知她不大会游泳，也许最好还是别问那么多了。弗兰奇也去了河边，但它只是站在河中央，俯身好好地喝了一通水，然后，甩着鬣毛，嘶叫了几声。

波莉和迪格雷围着太妃糖树忙开了。它的果实很好吃：跟太妃糖不完全一样——要软一些，汁水很多——是一种吃了令人想到太妃糖的水果。弗兰奇也美美地吃了一顿早餐；它尝了一个太妃果，很喜欢，但又说，在早晨那个钟点，青草更对它的胃口。然后，孩子们有点儿艰难地上了马背。第二天的旅行又开始了。

今天要比昨天好过得多啦，一方面是因为大伙儿都劲头十足，另一方面是因为初升的太阳在他们的背后，当光线在你背后时，万物看起来自然就越发美丽了。这是一段奇妙的旅程。四面八方高耸着巍峨的雪山，远远在他们脚下的山谷里一片苍翠，溪水是如此湛蓝，它们从冰山上翻滚而下，最后注入一条大河。他们就像在一块又一块巨大的宝石上面飞行，真盼望这段旅程能更长些。然而不一会儿，他们嗅到了一股气味，于是问：“那是什么？”“你闻到了吗？”“是从哪儿来的？”有一股温暖而甜美的芳香扑鼻而来，好像来自世上最可口的果实和最美丽的花朵。

“是从一个有湖泊的山谷里飘来的，”弗兰奇说。

“没错，”迪格雷说。“瞧！湖那边有座青山。看哪，湖水多蓝。”

“这地方肯定就是了，”他们异口同声地说。

弗兰奇盘旋着越飞越低，冰雪覆盖的山峰则似乎越耸越高。空气一分一秒地暖和、甜美起来了，几乎使你热泪盈眶。弗兰奇张开翅膀一动不动，任自己滑翔着，马蹄随时准备着陆。那座陡峭而苍翠的山丘朝他们扑面而来。不一会儿，弗兰奇就晃晃悠悠地降落在了山坡上。孩子们翻身下马，刚好落在温暖而柔软的草地上，谁也没伤着，他们站在那儿，轻轻地喘着气。

离山顶还有四分之一的路程，他们立刻朝顶峰进发了。（弗兰奇不时扑打一下翅膀，来帮助自己保持平衡，不然，我看它很难上去。）山顶上围着一圈高高的碧绿的草墙，墙内种着树，树枝探出了墙外，叶子不但有绿色和蓝色的，还有银色的，一阵风吹过，便随风摇摆起来。这几位旅行者终于到达了山顶，他们围着绿墙几乎绕了整整一圈才找到入口：那是一扇高大的金门，大门紧闭着，面朝正东。

到现在我还一直认为，当时弗兰奇和波莉是想跟迪格雷一起进去的，但他们很快就打消了这个念头。你从未见过如此与世隔绝的地方，一看就是块私人的领地。除非有特殊使命在身，不然只有傻瓜才会想着要进去呢。迪格雷马上就明白了过来，别人是不会也不能和他一起进去的。于是，他孤身一人朝着大门走去。

走近了大门，他看见金门上有好些银色的字，这样写着：

留在门外，或者跨入金门，

为人摘果，或将这欲望抵挡，

因为偷我果，或逾我墙的人，

终会如愿以偿，或丧气绝望。

“为人摘果，”迪格雷自言自语地说，“嗯，我正要这么干呢。我想，这就是说，我自己一口都不能吃喽。我猜不透最后一行在说什么。跨入金门。呃，要是可以走大门，谁愿意翻墙呢？可是，这门又怎么打开呢？”他把手放在门上，突然，门朝里面开了，铰链转动时一点儿声响都没有。

这会儿，他可以看到这地方的内部了，它比先前显得更加与世隔绝。他迈着庄重的步伐走了进去，不时环顾四周。里面十分安静，就连竖立在花园差不多中心处的一座喷泉，也只发出轻微的声响。他的四围弥漫着一股迷人的香气。那真是个令人愉悦的地方，只是太过严肃了。

他马上就认出要找的那棵树，一方面是因为那棵树耸立在正中央，另一方面因为树上挂满了银色的大苹果，银光闪闪，直照到没有阳光的阴暗处。他径直走了过去，摘下一个，放入了他贴胸的口袋。但在放进去之前，他忍不住看了看，又闻了闻。

这一看一闻可坏了事了，一阵极度的饥渴朝他袭来，让他很想去尝一尝那果子。他赶紧放入口袋；可树上还有那么多，尝一个会有什么错呢？他觉得，门上的告示不太会是禁令，可能只是一个忠告——忠告谁管它呢？就算它是禁令，吃一个苹果就算违反了吗？他好歹也做到“为人摘果”了呀。

正想着，他无意间抬头透过树枝望见树梢上栖着一只神奇的鸟儿。说“栖着”，是因为它似乎睡着了，但也许是半睡着，一只眼睛眯起一条细到不能再细的缝儿。那只鸟比鹰还大，胸部呈橘黄色，头上耸着一个猩红色的冠，尾巴的羽毛是紫色的。

“这恰恰告诉我们，”迪格雷后来对别人讲起这个故事时说道，“在这类神秘之域，你得尽量小心着，冷不丁就会有什么东西在窥视着你。”不过，我觉得不管怎样，迪格雷是不会为了自己去摘苹果的。在那年头孩子们的心中，“莫偷窃”这类观念我看比现在要根深蒂固得多。话虽这么说，我们毕竟没有十足的把握。

迪格雷趁转身走向大门那当儿，停下来最后环顾了一下四周。他吓了一大跳，原来这儿还不光他一个人，离他没几码远，站着那个女巫。她刚吃完一个苹果，把果核往旁边一扔。苹果汁比你想象的颜色要深，她沾得满嘴都是，让人瞧了恶心。迪格雷马上就猜到，她肯定是翻墙过来的。而且，他开始明白最后一行“终会如愿以偿，或丧气绝望”可能隐含着深意。因为这会儿女巫看上去比先前更强悍，更傲慢，也可以说更加得意忘形了；但她脸色惨白，白得跟盐一样。

这些念头在迪格雷心中一闪而过，接着，他抬起脚，憋足了劲儿大踏步朝大门跑去。女巫紧追不舍。他一出来，门就在他身后自动合上了。这回他虽然快了一步，但好景不长，刚等他赶上同伴，大声喊着“快，上马，波莉！快起飞，弗兰奇！”的时候，女巫已经翻上墙，或已翻下了墙，又紧追在他身后了。

“站在那儿，别动！”迪格雷转身对着她，大声喊。“否则，我们就全部消失。不准靠近一步。”

“傻孩子，”女巫说道，“干吗见了我就逃呀？我又不会伤害你。你要是这会儿不停下来听我说，可就错过一些能让你一辈子幸福的知识了。”

“哼，我不想听，谢了，”迪格雷嘴里回绝道，可心里还是想听的。

“我知道你来这儿的目的，”女巫继续说，“因为昨夜在树林里埋伏在你们身边的正是我，你们的谈话我全听见啦。你从那儿的花园里摘了个苹果，并装进你的口袋里。你一口都不能尝，要把它带回去给狮子，给它吃，让它用。你真是个傻瓜！你知道这是种什么果子吗？告诉你吧，这是青春之果，生命之果。我懂，因为我已经尝过了，我感到身上发生了种种变化，让我觉得自己会长生不老。吃吧，孩子，吃了它，咱俩都会长生不老，并且成为这个世界的国王与王后的——或者我们决定回去的话，你也可以在你们的世界里称王。”

“不，谢了，”迪格雷说。“我认识的人要是都死了，我还不知道自己想不想再活下去呢。我宁愿该活几岁就活几岁，死后能够进天堂。”

“可是，你妈妈怎么办呢？亏你还装得那么爱她。”

“她跟这事儿有什么关系？”迪格雷问。

“你怎么还不明白？傻瓜！只要给她吃一口那种苹果，她的病就好了。苹果在你口袋里，这儿只有咱俩，狮子离得很远。用你的魔法回到你自己的世界去，一分钟后，你就在你妈妈的床边了，可以给她送上这只苹果了。五分钟后，你就会看到她的脸上有了血色，她会告诉你病痛消失了。很快，她又会说她觉得自己有劲儿了。接着，她便睡着了——想一想吧，美美地睡上几小时，没有病痛，也不用吃药。到了第二天，谁都会说她居然神奇地康复了。很快，她就痊愈了。一切都变好了，你的家庭又会充满幸福，你又和别的孩子一样快乐了。”

“噢！”迪格雷喘着气，受了伤似的用手抱着头。他此刻终于明白，自己正面临着最可怕的选择。

“狮子给了你什么好处，你甘心给它当奴隶？”女巫说。“你一回到自己的世界，它又能把你怎样？要是你妈妈知道你本来可以消除她的病痛，让她起死回生，也让你爸爸不再伤心欲绝，而你却不愿意——宁愿为毫不相干的陌生世界里的一头畜生效劳，她会怎么想呢？”

“我——我不觉得它是一头畜生，”迪格雷用沙哑的嗓音说，“它是——我不知道——”

“它连畜生都不如，”女巫说，“看看它都对你干了些什么；看看它把你变得多么没心肝。谁听从它，它就这么对待谁。真是个狠心的、绝情的孩子！你宁愿让你妈妈死，而不愿——”

“啊，别说了，”迪格雷可怜巴巴地，依旧用沙哑的声音说。“你以为我拎不清吗？可我……我已经答应了。”

“唉，可你当时不明白自己答应了什么呀。再说了，这儿没有谁拦得住你。”

“就算妈妈自己，”迪格雷吞吞吐吐地说，“也不会乐意我这么干的——她严格地教育我要信守承诺——还不能偷东西——这类坏事儿决不能干。她要是在这儿的话，立马会教育我不能那样干的。”

“可是没必要让她知道呀，”女巫和蔼地说，一个凶神恶煞的巫婆说话这么和蔼，真让人难以想象。“你可以不告诉她你是怎样弄到苹果的，也不要让你爸爸知道，你的世界里谁也不必知道这事儿。你也不要把那个小女孩带回去，这你自己明白。”

最后这句话害得女巫功亏一篑。迪格雷当然知道，波莉能靠自己的戒指回去，就像他靠自己的戒指回去一样容易。但女巫显然不知道这一点。她让他抛下波莉自己溜走，这个建议实在太卑鄙了，一下子使女巫对他说过的一切话都成了假话和空话。虽然迪格雷正沉浸在悲伤之中，但头脑突然清醒了过来，说（他换了一种语调，嗓门也更大了）：

“喂，你怎么那么喜欢多管闲事呢？怎么一下子对我妈妈那么关心？这关你什么事？你究竟想玩什么把戏？”

“说得好，迪格雷，”波莉在他耳旁小声说。“快！现在就走。”在整个争吵过程中，她不敢发表什么意见，因为，你知道，快死的不是她的妈妈。

“上马，”迪格雷一边说一边将她托上马背，然后自己也尽快骑了上去。马儿展翅飞了起来。

“滚吧，傻瓜们！”女巫嚷着。“当你老了，虚弱得奄奄一息的时候，想想我吧，小子，别忘了当初自己怎样抛弃了永葆青春的机会！这机会永远没有了。”

他们已经飞得很高了，只能模模糊糊听见她在讲话。女巫也不愿浪费时间盯着他们；他们看见她冲下山坡朝北边去了。

那天早上，因为他们很早就出发了，花园里发生的事儿也没耽搁得太久，所以弗兰奇和波莉都说在天黑前赶回纳尼亚没有问题。回去的路上，迪格雷沉默不语，其他两位也就不好意思跟他搭话了。他伤心极了，一直想不通自己是否做对了；然而，只要他想起阿斯兰眼中闪烁的泪光，他就坚信自己没有做错。

一整天，弗兰奇都稳稳地飞翔着，拍打着它那对不知疲倦的翅膀。它向东飞去，那条河流是他们的向导。他们穿越高山，飞过荒芜的原始山林，经过大瀑布，然后越飞越低，最后降落在纳尼亚的一片林地里。四周悬崖高耸，将这片林地包裹在它的黑影之中。最后，太阳在他们身后落下，将天空染得红彤彤的。弗兰奇看见许多动物聚集在河边，很快，它就在它们中间看见了阿斯兰。弗兰奇收起双翅，伸出四蹄，滑翔而下，落地后一阵小跑，然后停了下来。两个孩子翻身下马，迪格雷看见所有的动物、小矮人、林神、河泽仙女等全都朝两边退去，为他让出一条道。他走到阿斯兰跟前，将苹果递给它，说：

“阁下，您要的苹果我给您带来了。”





第十四章　植树


“干得好，”阿斯兰的声音震颤大地。迪格雷知道所有的纳尼亚公民都听见了这句话，他们的故事将在那个崭新的世界里代代相传，流传好几百年，也许还会永远流传下去。然而，他并没有陷入骄傲自满的危险之中，因为，当他与阿斯兰面对面站着的时候，他的脑子里就根本不想这些东西了。这回，他觉得自己敢于直视狮子的双眸了。他早已忘记自己的难处，并感到一种彻底的心安与满足。

“干得好啊，亚当之子，”狮子又说了一遍。“因为你曾为这只苹果饥渴，也曾为之流泪，所以，只有你的手才能为这棵守卫纳尼亚的树播种。把苹果扔到河岸边松软的泥土中去吧。”

迪格雷照着做了。大家安静了下来，静得都能听到苹果落到泥土里的轻微响动。

“扔得好，”阿斯兰说。“现在，我们要为纳尼亚的弗兰克国王和他的海伦王后举行加冕典礼了。”

孩子们这才注意到这对夫妻。他们身着奇特而优雅的服装，华贵的长袍从他们肩上一直披下来拖在身后，国王那长长的衣摆由四个小矮人托着，王后的则由四个河泽仙女托着。他们的头上没戴装饰；海伦把头发披了下来，这使她看起来更加妩媚了。然而，使他们与先前迥然不同的并非发型，也非服装，而是洋溢在他们脸上的新的神态，尤其是国王。他在伦敦当马车夫那会儿养成的那股尖酸、狡诈和随时准备跟人干架的神气，全都荡然无存了，而他勇敢和善良的天性，倒更容易让人看见。或许，正是这个年轻世界的空气使他有了改变，或许是与阿斯兰的交谈，或许由于两者。

“说老实话，”弗兰奇对波莉耳语，“我的老主人几乎与我一样脱胎换骨啦。嘿，他这会儿是个真正的主人了。”

“没错，但别在我耳边乱哼哼了，”波莉说，“怪痒痒的。”

“现在，”阿斯兰说，“你们去几个人，把缠成一团的那几棵树松开，让我们看看里面到底是什么。”

迪格雷这才看见，有四棵树紧挨在一起长着，枝叶纠结缠绕，形成了一个笼子似的东西。两头大象用鼻子，几个小矮人用小斧头，很快就分开了那些枝叶。里面出现了三样东西：第一样是一棵看似金子做的小树；第二样是一棵看似银子做的小树；而第三样东西则罩着一件满是泥浆的衣服，弓着背坐在两棵树之间，模样十分凄惨。

“天哪！”迪格雷小声说道。“安德鲁舅舅！”

要解释清楚这件事，我们还得稍稍回顾一下。你们应该记得，动物们曾试着把安德鲁舅舅栽进土里并浇灌他。他被淋了一通水后神志恢复了过来，发现自己浑身湿透了，大腿以下都被埋在土里（土很快就成了泥浆），一大群野兽包围着他，数量多得他这辈子做梦也想不到。这也难怪他又吼又叫的了。可以说，这倒是一件好事儿，因为所有的动物（包括野猪）终于相信他是活的了。于是，它们又把他挖了出来（他的裤子这会儿准让人看了吓一跳）。腿一出来，他就想开溜，但大象迅速伸出鼻子在他腰上一卷，便使他的计划泡汤了。大家这会儿都觉得有必要把他安全地关在某个地方，等阿斯兰有空过来看了以后再行发落。于是，它们做了一个笼子或棚子之类的东西，将他圈了起来，又拿了些它们自以为能吃的东西去喂他。

驴子拾了一大堆蓟扔给他，但安德鲁舅舅似乎并不理睬。松鼠们连珠炮似的砸过去许多坚果，但他只是用手捂着头，躲得远远的。几只鸟儿辛勤地飞过来飞过去，给他投下了很多虫子。最好心的要属那头熊了，那天下午，它找到了一个野蜂窝，这头可敬的动物自己舍不得吃（它其实非常想吃），带回来给了安德鲁舅舅享用。然而，这可犯了最严重的错误。熊把那团黏糊糊的东西朝笼子顶端抛了上去，不巧正落在安德鲁舅舅的脸上（还有好些蜂活着呢）。熊自己可不在乎脸被蜂窝砸一下，因此就想不通安德鲁舅舅为何要跌跌撞撞地往后退，还滑了一跤，一屁股跌坐在地上。他太倒霉了，竟然一屁股坐在了那堆蓟上。“不管怎样，”那头野猪这样说，“那家伙的嘴里总算灌进了不少蜜，灌了总对他有好处。”动物们还真的慢慢喜欢上了这个新奇的玩意儿，并希望阿斯兰允许它们饲养着他。较聪明的一些动物这会儿十分肯定，他嘴里冒出的声音里至少有一部分是有意义的。它们都管他叫“不烂爹”，因为他嘴里老念叨着“白兰地”这个词儿。

不过，大伙儿最终不得不留他在那儿一个人过夜。阿斯兰那天一直忙着教导新国王和新王后，还得处理其他很重要的事情，所以也就无法顾及“可怜的老不烂爹”了。动物们扔了那么多坚果、梨子、苹果和香蕉给他，他的晚餐相当丰盛；但要说他度过了一个美妙的夜晚，可就是扯谎了。

“把那东西带上来，”阿斯兰吩咐说。一头大象用鼻子将安德鲁舅舅提了出来，放在狮子脚边。他吓得都无法动弹了。

“求您了，阿斯兰，”波莉说，“您能对他说点儿什么——让他不至于害怕吗？然后，能不能再跟他说一声，让他以后再也不来这里了？”

“你觉得他想来这里吗？”阿斯兰问。

“呃，阿斯兰，”波莉说，“他也许会派别人来。灯柱上拧下的那根铁棍长成了一棵灯柱树，他看了很激动，他想——”

“他的想法十分愚蠢，孩子，”阿斯兰说。“这个世界之所以几天来充满着生机，是因为我使它注入生机的歌声还在空中回荡，在地上轰鸣。这不会持续很久的。但我不能把这些告诉给这个老无赖听，我也无法安慰他；因为他害得自己听不懂我的话。我要是对他讲话，他只会听到一阵大吼大叫。哦，亚当之子啊，你们聪明地抵抗了给你们甜头的所有诱惑！不过，我会把他唯一能够接受的礼物给他的。”

狮子神色黯然地垂下它巨大的头，对着魔法师惊恐的脸庞吹了一口气。“睡吧，”它说，“睡吧，把你自讨的折磨丢开几个小时吧。”安德鲁舅舅立刻翻过身去合上了眼，安详地呼吸了起来。

“把他抬一边去，让他躺着，”阿斯兰说。“听着，小矮人们！施展你们的铁匠技艺，让我瞧瞧你们是怎样给国王和王后制作王冠的。”

你做梦也想不到会有那么多的小矮人全都朝着那棵金树奔了过去，一眨眼，他们就剥光了树上所有的叶子，连一些枝条也被扯了下来。这会儿，孩子们看清楚了，那棵树不光看上去金灿灿，它其实就是柔软的真金子。金树长出来的地方，当然就是安德鲁舅舅被倒栽时金币从他口袋里滚落下来的地方；那些银树也同样是由滚落的银币长成的。干柴火、小铁砧、锤子、钳子和风箱，一切准备就绪了，真不知是从哪里弄来的。不一会儿（那群小矮人可喜欢自己的工作啦！），火生起来了，风箱呼呼地拉起来了，金子熔化了，铁锤叮叮当当地敲起来了。一大早被阿斯兰派去掘地的那两只鼹鼠（它们最喜欢干这活儿），把一大堆宝石倒在小矮人脚边。两顶王冠就这么在小铁匠们灵巧的双手下做成了——它不是那种丑陋而笨重的现代欧洲式样的王冠，而是轻巧、精致、造型优美的圆环，你一定戴得上去，戴上后也一定会让你更漂亮。国王的王冠是镶红宝石的，王后的则镶着绿宝石。

王冠在河水中冷却后，阿斯兰吩咐弗兰克和海伦在它面前跪下，将王冠戴到他们头上。接着，它说：“起立吧，纳尼亚的国王与王后，纳尼亚及其周围的岛屿还有阿钦兰的国王们，都将是你们的儿孙。你们要公正、仁慈和勇敢。祝福你们。”

大家都欢呼了起来，汪汪汪、呜呜呜，还有拍打翅膀的声音，响成了一片。国王夫妇站立着，神色庄严，略带羞涩，但羞涩使他们显得更为高贵了。迪格雷正欢呼着，听见身边传来了阿斯兰低沉的嗓音，说：

“看吧！”

大伙儿都扭头看去，真是又惊又喜，不禁深吸了一口气。原来，他们看见一棵树就在他们近旁冒了出来，刚才还没有呢，现在已经高过他们的头顶了。这棵树一定是趁他们忙着为国王和王后加冕那会儿，静悄悄地长起来的，像把旗帜升上旗杆那样长得飞快。它伸展的枝丫投下的是一片亮光，而不是一片阴影；银灿灿的苹果像星星一般在每一片叶子底下眨着眼睛。不过，使大伙儿深吸一口气的，与其说是这棵树的身姿，倒不如说是它芬芳的气味。那一瞬间，你的脑子里很难再想别的什么了。

“亚当之子，”阿斯兰说，“你栽得很成功。而你们，纳尼亚的公民们，保卫这棵树成了你们的首要职责，因为它就是你们的盾。我跟你们说的那个女巫，已远远地向北逃去了；她会一直待在那里，靠邪恶的魔法变得越来越厉害。但只要这棵树枝繁叶茂，她就休想踏进纳尼亚一步。这棵树方圆一百英里内，她绝不敢踏入，因为它的气味能带给你们欢乐、生机和健康，而带给她的却是死亡、恐惧和绝望。”

大伙儿都神情严肃地凝视着那棵树，突然，阿斯兰甩了甩头（毛发上随即金光四射），接着，它紧紧地盯着孩子们。“出什么事儿了，孩子们？”它问，因为它发现他们正在说着悄悄话，并且你推一下我，我碰一下你。

“哦——阿斯兰，阁下，”迪格雷红着脸说，“我忘了告诉您了，女巫已经吃了一个苹果，就是这棵树上结的那种。”他并没有把心里想的一下子全说出来，但波莉立刻替他说了（迪格雷总是比她更害怕被人当成傻瓜）。

“所以，阿斯兰，我们觉得，”她说，“肯定哪里有差错，她其实根本不在乎那些苹果的气味。”

“你为什么这么觉得，夏娃的女儿？”狮子问。

“唔，她吃了一个。”

“孩子，”狮子说，“所以说，剩下的苹果现在对她来说都很可怕了。谁要是在错误的时间，用错误的方式摘了并吃了那些果子，麻烦就发生在谁的身上。苹果很可口，但他们从今以后会厌恶它。”

“哦，我懂了，”波莉说。“我想，因为她吃了不该她吃的东西，苹果对她就不起作用了。我是说，她吃了也不会长生不老或其他什么的。”

“啊，不，”阿斯兰摇着头说，“她会长生不老的。万事万物永远按其规律运转。她如愿以偿了，她像女神一样得到了无穷的力量和无尽的寿命。然而，若一个人带着一颗邪恶的心灵，即使活着也是受罪，她已经开始明白这一点了。这些人能呼风唤雨，却又常常对此感到十分厌倦。”

“我——我自己也差点儿吃了一个，阿斯兰，”迪格雷说，“我会不会——”

“你会的，孩子，”阿斯兰说，“因为苹果该起什么作用还是起什么作用——它必须这样——但它不会使那些擅自摘它的人快乐。如果哪一位纳尼亚公民擅自偷摘了一个苹果，然后栽在这里保卫纳尼亚，它肯定能保卫纳尼亚的。但是，它只能最终使纳尼亚沦为另一个恰恩，一个像它那样强大而残酷的帝国，而不是成为我所希望的一片充满友爱的乐土。女巫还想诱惑你干另一件事情，是不是，我的孩子？”

“是的，阿斯兰。她要我摘一个苹果带回家给妈妈。”

“要知道，这也是会治好她的病的，但不会给你或她带来欢乐。终有一天，你俩回想起这件事时，都会说，还不如当初病死的好。”

迪格雷被泪水哽咽住了，一句话都说不出来。他放弃了救他妈妈性命的全部希望；但同时他明白了，狮子洞悉将会发生的一切；他还明白了，有些事情也许比让死神夺走你所爱的人更为可怕。而正在此时，阿斯兰又开口了，它悄悄说：

“如果那苹果是偷来的，孩子，那么以上所说的后果都会出现。不过这次不会了。我现在给你的苹果会带来欢乐。在你们的世界里，它不会使人长生不老，但能够治愈疾病。去吧，从树上摘一个苹果给你妈妈吧。”

一时间，迪格雷差不多懵了，好像天翻地覆一般。接着，他梦游似的朝那棵树走了过去，国王和王后为他欢呼，所有的动物也都为他欢呼。他摘下苹果，放进自己的口袋，然后走回到阿斯兰的身边。

“请问，”他说，“我们可以现在就回家吗？”他都忘了说“谢谢”，不过他心里是想说的，这点阿斯兰明白。





第十五章　这个故事的结局以及其他故事的开场


“有我在这儿，你们用不着戒指，”阿斯兰告诉他们。孩子们眨巴着眼睛，左顾右盼的。他们又回到了各个世界间的树林；安德鲁舅舅躺在草地上，呼呼大睡着；阿斯兰立在他们身旁。

“来，”阿斯兰说，“你们该回去了。但有两件事你们需注意：一个是忠告，另一个是命令。看这儿，孩子们。”

他们放眼望去，只见草地上有个小小的坑，坑内又暖又干，坑底还长满了草。

“你们上次来的时候，”阿斯兰说，“这个坑还是个水潭。你们跳进去后，就到了垂死的太阳照耀下的荒城恰恩。现在，水潭没有了，那个世界也消失了，好像从来就没有存在过一样。让亚当和夏娃的种族引以为戒吧。”

“知道了，阿斯兰，”两个孩子异口同声回答。但波莉又补充了一句：“可我们的世界没那么糟吧，对不对，阿斯兰？”

“还没有，夏娃的女儿，”它说，“现在还不至于，但正在变得越来越糟。说不定你们种族中某个邪恶之徒会发现像绝命咒那样的邪咒，并用它来毁灭所有的生灵。离这一天不远了，很快，还没等你们变成老头子和老太婆，你们世界中的大国将被独裁者统治，他们跟简蒂丝女王一样，无视幸福、正义和仁慈。让你们的世界提防着吧。这就是那个忠告。现在要说那个命令了。尽快从你们舅舅那里拿回那些魔法戒指，埋了它们，不能再让人使用了。”

狮子说这番话的时候，两个孩子都昂着头，看着它的脸。顷刻间（他们根本不知道这究竟是怎么回事），那张脸变成了一片汹涌的金色海洋，他们漂浮在海洋中，一种甜美的充满力量的感觉朝他们涌来，淹没了他们，并注入他们体内，使他们感到自己从未有过的真正的幸福、智慧与善良，甚至从没有活过，也没有醒过。那一刻的记忆一直伴随着他们，在他们的一生中，每当感到悲哀、恐惧或者愤怒，就会重又想起那徜徉在金色中的幸福，好似这感觉依然存在，近在眼前，就藏在某个拐角，或躲在某扇门后，这使他们由衷地相信，一切都是美好的。不一会儿，这三个人（安德鲁舅舅这会儿也醒了）就一下子跌回到了伦敦那喧嚣、炎热和刺鼻的气味之中了。

他们走在凯特利家前门外的人行道上，除了女巫、马和马车夫消失了以外，一切还是他们离开时的老样子。灯柱还在那里，只是缺了一根杆子；撞烂的马车还在；那群人也还在。大伙儿仍在七嘴八舌地说着，人们跪在那个被砸晕了的警察跟前，有的喊：“他醒过来了。”有的问：“你现在好点儿了吗，老兄？”有的说：“救护车马上就到了。”

“我的天哪！”迪格雷心想。“我觉得这次历险从头到尾连一秒钟都没有过去。”

大部分人还在疯狂地搜寻简蒂丝和那匹马，根本没人注意到孩子们，因为谁也没有看见他们离去，自然谁也不会注意到他们回来。至于安德鲁舅舅嘛，他一身的破烂加上满脸的蜂蜜，谁都甭想认出他来了。正巧，屋子的前门开着，女佣正站在门口看热闹（这姑娘那天别提有多开心了），所以，还没等别人对他们说三道四，孩子们就顺利地催着安德鲁舅舅进了门。

他抢在他们前面上了楼。起先，他们还怕他直奔阁楼，要把剩下的魔法戒指藏起来呢。可他们的担心是多余的，他惦记的是柜子里的酒瓶。他立马躲进了卧室，锁上了房门。当他再次出现时（时间倒不长），换上了一身家居服，径直走向浴室。

“你去找剩下的戒指好吗，波莉？”迪格雷说。“我想去看妈妈。”

“没问题，一会儿见，”波莉话音刚落，阁楼楼梯上就响起了她噔噔噔的脚步声。

迪格雷稍稍喘了口气，便轻手轻脚地走入了妈妈的房间。他妈妈还是照老样子躺在那里，头靠在枕头上，面庞消瘦而苍白，让人看了想哭。迪格雷从他的口袋里掏出了生命之果。

正如简蒂丝到了我们的世界就看上去与在她自己的世界不同一样，那个果实看上去也不一样了。卧室里自然有不少各式各样、五颜六色的东西，像床罩、壁纸、窗口射入的太阳光，还有妈妈那件漂亮的浅蓝色上衣，但迪格雷从口袋里一掏出苹果，所有这一切都丧失了光彩，就连太阳光也黯然失色了。光灿灿的苹果在天花板上投下奇异的光彩，别的东西都不值得一看了：你也无法再看清别的东西了。那青春之果的芳香让你觉得屋内似乎有一扇通往天堂的窗户正敞开着。

“哦，亲爱的，它瞧着真让人喜欢，”迪格雷的妈妈说。

“您吃了它，好吗？请您吃了吧，”迪格雷说。

“我不知道医生会说啥，”她说，“不过，真的——我觉得我好像能吃了它。”

迪格雷把苹果削了皮，切好了片儿，一片一片地喂给妈妈吃。刚一吃完，妈妈就微笑了。她把头往后一枕，便酣然入睡：那是真正的自然而甜美的睡眠，不需要借助那些难吃的药物。迪格雷知道，世上所有东西中，这才是妈妈最想要的。这时候，他很肯定妈妈的脸色起了些变化。他俯下身，给了她轻轻的一个吻，然后拿着苹果核悄悄地走出了屋子，心怦怦直跳。那一天里，周围的一切在他眼里怎么看都是平淡无奇的，他几乎不敢抱任何希望了；但每当他想起阿斯兰的脸，心中就又燃起了希望。

那天夜里，他将苹果核埋在了后花园里。

第二天一早，医生像往常一样来探病，迪格雷就倚在楼梯扶手上听。他听见医生和蕾蒂姨妈出来时说：

“凯特利小姐，在我一辈子的行医生涯中，还从未见过这么反常的病例。它——它简直就是个奇迹。我现在先不跟那男孩儿说起什么；我们不能让人白高兴一场。不过，依我看……”接着，他的声音便低得听不见了。

那天下午，迪格雷来到花园里吹起了口哨，那是他跟波莉约定的暗号（她前一天没能过来）。

“有什么好消息？”波莉从墙那边望了过来，问。“我是说，你妈妈好点了吗？”

“我想——我想她正在好起来，”迪格雷说。“不过，要是你不介意，我真的不想再提这件事儿了。戒指怎么样了？”

“我全拿到了，”波莉说。“瞧，没事儿，我戴着手套呢。咱们去把它们埋了吧。”

“好，这就行动。我已经在昨天埋了苹果核的地方做了记号。”

波莉翻墙过来后，两人一起来到了那个地方。一看才知道，其实迪格雷根本用不着做记号。地面上已经长出了点东西，虽然它不像纳尼亚新生的树木一样，你能看着它长起来，但它已经冒出了地面。他们拿了一把铲子，把所有的魔法戒指，包括他们自己的，围着那东西埋了一圈。

大约过了一周，迪格雷妈妈的病明显有了好转。两周后，她能到花园里坐着了。又过了一个月，整幢房子全变了样。蕾蒂姨妈为妈妈做了她喜欢的所有事儿；窗子打开了，脏兮兮的窗帘拉开了，屋子里明亮了起来，到处摆满了新摘的鲜花，饭菜做得更可口了，旧钢琴调好音了，妈妈又开始唱歌了，并和迪格雷以及波莉玩起了游戏，看得蕾蒂姨妈连连说：“我敢说，玛贝尔，你是三个孩子中最大的一个。”

当凡事不顺时，你会觉得它们总会越来越糟，要糟上好一段时间；而当万事顺利时，又往往是越来越顺。这种快乐的生活持续了大约六周以后，在印度的爸爸写来了一封很长的信，告诉他们好多令人惊喜的消息。老舅爷柯克去世了，显然，这意味着爸爸现在非常富有。他即将从印度退休回家，永远与他们在一起了。迪格雷此前常听人说起但从未见过的那所大宅子，现在成了他们的家。大宅子里摆着好几副盔甲；宅子还带有马厩和狗棚；附近有小河、公园、暖房、葡萄园和树林；宅子后面还有山。这不禁让你也和迪格雷一样觉得，他们从今以后一定会过上幸福而美满的生活。不过，你也许还想再了解一两件别的事情。

波莉和迪格雷成了始终非常要好的朋友，她几乎每个假期都要到乡下去，住在他们那所漂亮的宅子里。就是在那里，她学会了骑马、游泳、挤牛奶、烤面包和爬山。

在纳尼亚，动物们过着十分平静而快乐的生活，几百年里再也没有女巫或其他敌人来侵扰那片乐土。弗兰克国王与海伦王后以及他们的子孙也在纳尼亚快快乐乐地生活着。他们的第二个儿子当上了阿钦兰的国王。他们的儿子都娶了仙女，女儿都嫁了树神与河神。女巫栽下的灯柱（她是无意中栽下的）在纳尼亚森林里日夜照耀着，因此灯柱长起来的那块荒地被叫作灯柱林。许多年后的一个雪夜，另一个孩子从我们的世界来到了纳尼亚，发现那盏灯依旧亮着。那次历险与我刚刚告诉你们的故事有着这样或那样的关联。

事情是这样的：迪格雷在后花园里埋下的苹果核逐渐长成了一棵很漂亮的树。因为它长在我们这个世界的土壤里，远离了阿斯兰的歌声与纳尼亚的年轻空气，所以它结出的苹果并不能救活像迪格雷妈妈那样的垂死的妇人，不过这果子在英格兰确实属最漂亮的了，吃了也很有益健康，只是不再具有魔力。然而，在它体内，在汁液当中，这棵树（姑且这么叫它吧）一定忘不了它所属的在纳尼亚的另一棵树。有时候没有风，它也会神秘地摇摆起来。我想，纳尼亚那会儿一定是狂风大作，这棵在英格兰的树之所以战栗，是因为那棵在纳尼亚的树正在强劲的西南风中东摇西摆。不过，后来还是证明了，这棵树的木材仍然保留着魔力。它是这样被发现的：等到迪格雷差不多中年时（他那时已是知名学者、教授和大旅行家了），凯特利家的那座老宅已归他所有；有一回，一场席卷英格兰南部的风暴刮倒了那棵树，他不忍心让人劈了当柴火，于是就叫人用一部分木料做了一个大衣柜，放在他乡下的大宅子里。虽然他自己没有发现那衣柜的魔力，另一个人却发现了。我们这个世界和纳尼亚王国间发生的所有故事就由此开场，你们可以在这个系列故事的另外几本书里读到。

迪格雷和他的家人搬到乡下的大宅子里去生活时，带上了安德鲁舅舅，让他跟他们住在一起；因为迪格雷的爸爸叮嘱他们：“我们必须阻止这老家伙再搞恶作剧了，再说，一直让可怜的蕾蒂照看他，也太说不过去了。”安德鲁舅舅从此金盆洗手，后半辈子没再碰过魔法。他吸取了教训，到了晚年，终于洗心革面，变得比较和善，也不像以前那样自私了。不过，他总爱在弹子房里单独会客，给他们讲一个神秘的女人，她是外国王族，他俩曾驾着马车在伦敦城里满大街地兜风。“她那臭脾气可不是好惹的，”他每次都这么说，“可她真是个优雅的妇人啊，老兄，好一个优雅的妇人哪。”





Chapter 1　THE WRONG DOOR


This is a story about something that happened long ago when your grandfather was a child. It is a very important story because it shows how all the comings and goings between our own world and the land of Narnia first began.

In those days Mr. Sherlock Holmes was still living in Baker Street and the Bastables were looking for treasure in the Lewisham Road. In those days, if you were a boy you had to wear a stiff Eton collar every day, and schools were usually nastier than now. But meals were nicer; and as for sweets, I won’t tell you how cheap and good they were, because it would only make your mouth water in vain. And in those days there lived in London a girl called Polly Plummer.

She lived in one of a long row of houses which were all joined together. One morning she was out in the back garden when a boy scrambled up from the garden next door and put his face over the wall. Polly was very surprised because up till now there had never been any children in that house, but only Mr. Ketterley and Miss Ketterley, a brother and sister, old bachelor and old maid, living together. So she looked up, full of curiosity. The face of the strange boy was very grubby. It could hardly have been grubbier if he had first rubbed his hands in the earth, and then had a good cry, and then dried his face with his hands. As a matter of fact, this was very nearly what he had been doing.

“Hullo,” said Polly.

“Hullo,” said the boy. “What’s your name?”

“Polly,” said Polly. “What’s yours?”

“Digory,” said the boy.

“I say, what a funny name!” said Polly.

“It isn’t half so funny as Polly,” said Digory.

“Yes it is,” said Polly.

“No, it isn’t,” said Digory.

“At any rate I do wash my face,” said Polly, “which is what you need to do; especially after—” and then she stopped. She had been going to say “After you’ve been blubbing,” but she thought that wouldn’t be polite.

“Alright, I have then,” said Digory in a much louder voice, like a boy who was so miserable that he didn’t care who knew he had been crying. “And so would you,” he went on, “if you’d lived all your life in the country and had a pony, and a river at the bottom of the garden, and then been brought to live in a beastly Hole like this.”

“London isn’t a Hole,” said Polly indignantly. But the boy was too wound up to take any notice of her, and he went on—

“And if your father was away in India—and you had to come and live with an Aunt and an Uncle who’s mad (who would like that?)—and if the reason was that they were looking after your Mother—and if your Mother was ill and was going to—going to—die.” Then his face went the wrong sort of shape as it does if you’re trying to keep back your tears.

“I didn’t know. I’m sorry,” said Polly humbly. And then, because she hardly knew what to say, and also to turn Digory’s mind to cheerful subjects, she asked:

“Is Mr. Ketterley really mad?”

“Well either he’s mad,” said Digory, “or there’s some other mystery. He has a study on the top floor and Aunt Letty says I must never go up there. Well, that looks fishy to begin with. And then there’s another thing. Whenever he tries to say anything to me at meal times—he never even tries to talk to her—she always shuts him up. She says, “Don’t worry the boy, Andrew” or “I’m sure Digory doesn’t want to hear about that” or else “Now, Digory, wouldn’t you like to go out and play in the garden?”

“What sort of things does he try to say?”

“I don’t know. He never gets far enough. But there’s more than that. One night—it was last night in fact—as I was going past the foot of the attic-stairs on my way to bed (and I don’t much care for going past them either) I’m sure I heard a yell.”

“Perhaps he keeps a mad wife shut up there.”

“Yes, I’ve thought of that.”

“Or perhaps he’s a coiner.”

“Or he might have been a pirate, like the man at the beginning of Treasure Island, and be always hiding from his old shipmates.”

“How exciting!” said Polly, “I never knew your house was so interesting.”

“You may think it interesting,” said Digory. “But you wouldn’t like it if you had to sleep there. How would you like to lie awake listening for Uncle Andrew’s step to come creeping along the passage to your room? And he has such awful eyes.”

That was how Polly and Digory got to know one another: and as it was just the beginning of the summer holidays and neither of them was going to the sea that year, they met nearly every day.

Their adventures began chiefly because it was one of the wettest and coldest summers there had been for years. That drove them to do indoor things: you might say, indoor exploration. It is wonderful how much exploring you can do with a stump of candle in a big house, or in a row of houses. Polly had discovered long ago that if you opened a certain little door in the box-room attic of her house you would find the cistern and a dark place behind it which you could get into by a little careful climbing. The dark place was like a long tunnel with brick wall on one side and sloping roof on the other. In the roof there were little chunks of light between the slates. There was no floor in this tunnel: you had to step from rafter to rafter, and between them there was only plaster. If you stepped on this you would find yourself falling through the ceiling of the room below. Polly had used the bit of the tunnel just beside the cistern as a smugglers’ cave. She had brought up bits of old packing cases and the seats of broken kitchen chairs, and things of that sort, and spread them across from rafter to rafter so as to make a bit of floor. Here she kept a cash-box containing various treasures, and a story she was writing and usually a few apples. She had often drunk a quiet bottle of ginger-beer in there: the old bottles made it look more like a smugglers’ cave.

Digory quite liked the cave (she wouldn’t let him see the story) but he was more interested in exploring.

“Look here,” he said. “How long does this tunnel go on for? I mean, does it stop where your house ends?”

“No,” said Polly. “The walls don’t go out to the roof. It goes on. I don’t know how far.”

“Then we could get the length of the whole row of houses.”

“So we could,” said Polly. “And oh, I say!”

“What?”

“We could get into the other houses.”

“Yes, and get taken up for burglars! No thanks.”

“Don’t be so jolly clever. I was thinking of the house beyond yours.”

“What about it?”

“Why, it’s the empty one. Daddy says it’s always been empty since we came here.”

“I suppose we ought to have a look at it then,” said Digory. He was a good deal more excited than you’d have thought from the way he spoke. For of course he was thinking, just as you would have been, of all the reasons why the house might have been empty so long. So was Polly. Neither of them said the word “haunted.” And both felt that once the thing had been suggested, it would be feeble not to do it.

“Shall we go and try it now?” said Digory.

“Alright,” said Polly.

“Don’t if you’d rather not,” said Digory.

“I’m game if you are,” said she.

“How are we to know we’re in the next house but one?”

They decided they would have to go out into the box-room and walk across it taking steps as long as the steps from one rafter to the next. That would give them an idea of how many rafters went to a room. Then they would allow about four more for the passage between the two attics in Polly’s house, and then the same number for the maid’s bedroom as for the box-room. That would give them the length of the house. When they had done that distance twice they would be at the end of Digory’s house; any door they came to after that would let them into an attic of the empty house.

“But I don’t expect it’s really empty at all,” said Digory.

“What do you expect?”

“I expect someone lives there in secret, only coming in and out at night, with a dark lantern. We shall probably discover a gang of desperate criminals and get a reward. It’s all rot to say a house would be empty all those years unless there was some mystery.”

“Daddy thought it must be the drains,” said Polly.

“Pooh! Grown-ups are always thinking of uninteresting explanations,” said Digory. Now that they were talking by daylight in the attic instead of by candlelight in the Smugglers’ Cave it seemed much less likely that the empty house would be haunted.

When they had measured the attic they had to get a pencil and do a sum. They both got different answers to it at first, and even when they agreed I am not sure they got it right. They were in a hurry to start on the exploration.

“We mustn’t make a sound,” said Polly as they climbed in again behind the cistern. Because it was such an important occasion they took a candle each (Polly had a good store of them in her cave).

It was very dark and dusty and draughty and they stepped from rafter to rafter without a word except when they whispered to one another, “We’re opposite your attic now” or “this must be halfway through our house.” And neither of them stumbled and the candles didn’t go out, and at last they came where they could see a little door in the brick wall on their right. There was no bolt or handle on this side of it, of course, for the door had been made for getting in, not for getting out; but there was a catch (as there often is on the inside of a cupboard door) which they felt sure they would be able to turn.

“Shall I?” said Digory.

“I’m game if you are,” said Polly, just as she had said before. Both felt that it was becoming very serious, but neither would draw back. Digory pushed round the catch with some difficultly. The door swung open and the sudden daylight made them blink. Then, with a great shock, they saw that they were looking, not into a deserted attic, but into a furnished room. But it seemed empty enough. It was dead silent. Polly’s curiosity got the better of her. She blew out her candle and stepped out into the strange room, making no more noise than a mouse.

It was shaped, of course, like an attic, but furnished as a sitting-room. Every bit of the walls was lined with shelves and every bit of the shelves was full of books. A fire was burning in the grate (you remember that it was a very cold wet summer that year) and in front of the fireplace with its back toward them was a high-backed armchair. Between the chair and Polly, and filling most of the middle of the room, was a big table piled with all sorts of things—printed books, and books of the sort you write in, and ink bottles and pens and sealing-wax and a microscope. But what she noticed first was a bright red wooden tray with a number of rings on it. They were in pairs—a yellow one and a green one together, then a little space, and then another yellow one and another green one. They were no bigger than ordinary rings, and no one could help noticing them because they were so bright. They were the most beautiful shiny little things you can imagine. If Polly had been a very little younger she would have wanted to put one in her mouth.

The room was so quiet that you noticed the ticking of the clock at once. And yet, as she now found, it was not absolutely quiet either. There was a faint—a very, very faint—humming sound. If Hoovers had been invented in those days Polly would have thought it was the sound of a Hoover being worked a long way off—several rooms away and several floors below. But it was a nicer sound than that, a more musical tone: only so faint that you could hardly hear it.

“It’s alright; there’s no one here,” said Polly over her shoulder to Digory. She was speaking above a whisper now. And Digory came out, blinking and looking extremely dirty—as indeed Polly was too.

“This is no good,” he said. “It’s not an empty house at all. We’d better leave before anyone comes.”

“What do you think those are?” said Polly, pointing at the coloured rings.

“Oh come on,” said Digory. “The sooner—”

He never finished what he was going to say for at that moment something happened. The high-backed chair in front of the fire moved suddenly and there rose up out of it—like a pantomime demon coming up out of a trapdoor—the alarming form of Uncle Andrew. They were not in the empty house at all; they were in Digory’s house and in the forbidden study! Both children said “O-o-oh” and realized their terrible mistake. They felt they ought to have known all along that they hadn’t gone nearly far enough.

Uncle Andrew was tall and very thin. He had a long clean-shaven face with a sharply-pointed nose and extremely bright eyes and a great tousled mop of grey hair.

Digory was quite speechless, for Uncle Andrew looked a thousand times more alarming than he had ever looked before. Polly was not so frightened yet; but she soon was. For the very first thing Uncle Andrew did was to walk across to the door of the room, shut it, and turn the key in the lock. Then he turned round, fixed the children with his bright eyes, and smiled, showing all his teeth.

“There!” he said. “Now my fool of a sister can’t get at you!”

It was dreadfully unlike anything a grown-up would be expected to do. Polly’s heart came into her mouth, and she and Digory started backing toward the little door they had come in by. Uncle Andrew was too quick for them. He got behind them and shut that door too and stood in front of it. Then he rubbed his hands and made his knuckles crack. He had very long, beautifully white, fingers.

“I am delighted to see you,” he said. “Two children are just what I wanted.”

“Please, Mr. Ketterley,” said Polly. “It’s nearly my dinner time and I’ve got to go home. Will you let us out, please?”

“Not just yet,” said Uncle Andrew. “This is too good an opportunity to miss. I wanted two children. You see, I’m in the middle of a great experiment. I’ve tried it on a guinea-pig and it seemed to work. But then a guinea-pig can’t tell you anything. And you can’t explain to it how to come back.”

“Look here, Uncle Andrew,” said Digory, “it really is dinner time and they’ll be looking for us in a moment. You must let us out.”

“Must?” said Uncle Andrew.

Digory and Polly glanced at one another. They dared not say anything, but the glances meant “Isn’t this dreadful?” and “We must humour him.”

“If you let us go for our dinner now,” said Polly, “we could come back after dinner.”

“Ah, but how do I know that you would?” said Uncle Andrew with a cunning smile. Then he seemed to change his mind.

“Well, well,” he said, “if you really must go, I suppose you must. I can’t expect two youngsters like you to find it much fun talking to an old buffer like me.” He sighed and went on. “You’ve no idea how lonely I sometimes am. But no matter. Go to your dinner. But I must give you a present before you go. It’s not every day that I see a little girl in my dingy old study; especially, if I may say so, such a very attractive young lady as yourself.”

Polly began to think he might not really be mad after all.

“Wouldn’t you like a ring, my dear?” said Uncle Andrew to Polly.

“Do you mean one of those yellow or green ones?” said Polly. “How lovely!”

“Not a green one,” said Uncle Andrew. “I’m afraid I can’t give the green ones away. But I’d be delighted to give you any of the yellow ones: with my love. Come and try one on.”

Polly had now quite got over her fright and felt sure that the old gentleman was not mad; and there was certainly something strangely attractive about those bright rings. She moved over to the tray.

“Why! I declare,” she said. “That humming noise gets louder here. It’s almost as if the rings were making it.”

“What a funny fancy, my dear,” said Uncle Andrew with a laugh. It sounded a very natural laugh, but Digory had seen an eager, almost a greedy, look on his face.

“Polly! Don’t be a fool!” he shouted. “Don’t touch them.”

It was too late. Exactly as he spoke, Polly’s hand went out to touch one of the rings. And immediately, without a flash or a noise or a warning of any sort, there was no Polly. Digory and his Uncle were alone in the room.





Chapter 2　DIGORY AND HIS UNCLE


It was so sudden, and so horribly unlike anything that had ever happened to Digory even in a nightmare, that he let out a scream. Instantly Uncle Andrew’s hand was over his mouth. “None of that!” he hissed in Digory’s ear. “If you start making a noise your Mother’ll hear it. And you know what a fright might do to her.”

As Digory said afterwards, the horrible meanness of getting at a chap in that way, almost made him sick. But of course he didn’t scream again.

“That’s better,” said Uncle Andrew. “Perhaps you couldn’t help it. It is a shock when you first see someone vanish. Why, it gave even me a turn when the guinea-pig did it the other night.”

“Was that when you yelled?” asked Digory.

“Oh, you heard that, did you? I hope you haven’t been spying on me?”

“No, I haven’t,” said Digory indignantly. “But what’s happened to Polly?”

“Congratulate me, my dear boy,” said Uncle Andrew, rubbing his hands. “My experiment has succeeded. The little girl’s gone—vanished—right out of the world.”

“What have you done to her?”

“Sent her to—well—to another place.”

“What do you mean?” asked Digory.

Uncle Andrew sat down and said, “Well, I’ll tell you all about it. Have you ever heard of old Mrs. Lefay?”

“Wasn’t she a great-aunt or something?” said Digory.

“Not exactly,” said Uncle Andrew. “She was my godmother. That’s her, there, on the wall.”

Digory looked and saw a faded photograph: it showed the face of an old woman in a bonnet. And he could now remember that he had once seen a photo of the same face in an old drawer, at home, in the country. He had asked his Mother who it was and Mother had not seemed to want to talk about the subject much. It was not at all a nice face, Digory thought, though of course with those early photographs one could never really tell.

“Was there—wasn’t there—something wrong about her, Uncle Andrew?” he asked.

“Well,” said Uncle Andrew with a chuckle, “it depends what you call wrong. People are so narrow-minded. She certainly got very queer in later life. Did very unwise things. That was why they shut her up.”

“In an asylum, do you mean?”

“Oh no, no, no,” said Uncle Andrew in a shocked voice. “Nothing of that sort. Only in prison.”

“I say!” said Digory. “What had she done?”

“Ah, poor woman,” said Uncle Andrew. “She had been very unwise. There were a good many different things. We needn’t go into all that. She was always very kind to me.”

“But look here, what has all this got to do with Polly? I do wish you’d—”

“All in good time, my boy,” said Uncle Andrew. “They let old Mrs. Lefay out before she died and I was one of the very few people whom she would allow to see her in her last illness. She had got to dislike ordinary, ignorant people, you understand. I do myself. But she and I were interested in the same sort of things. It was only a few days before her death that she told me to go to an old bureau in her house and open a secret drawer and bring her a little box that I would find there. The moment I picked up that box I could tell by the pricking in my fingers that I held some great secret in my hands. She gave it me and made me promise that as soon as she was dead I would burn it, unopened, with certain ceremonies. That promise I did not keep.”

“Well, then, it was jolly rotten of you,” said Digory.

“Rotten?” said Uncle Andrew with a puzzled look. “Oh, I see. You mean that little boys ought to keep their promises. Very true: most right and proper, I’m sure, and I’m very glad you have been taught to do it. But of course you must understand that rules of that sort, however excellent they may be for little boys—and servants—and women—and even people in general, can’t possibly be expected to apply to profound students and great thinkers and sages. No, Digory. Men like me, who possess hidden wisdom, are freed from common rules just as we are cut off from common pleasures. Ours, my boy, is a high and lonely destiny.”

As he said this he sighed and looked so grave and noble and mysterious that for a second Digory really thought he was saying something rather fine. But then he remembered the ugly look he had seen on his Uncle’s face the moment before Polly had vanished; and all at once he saw through Uncle Andrew’s grand words. “All it means,” he said to himself, “Is that he thinks he can do anything he likes to get anything he wants.”

“Of course,” said Uncle Andrew, “I didn’t dare to open the box for a long time, for I knew it might contain something highly dangerous. For my godmother was a very remarkable woman. The truth is, she was one of the last mortals in this country who had fairy blood in her. (She said there had been two others in her time. One was a duchess and the other was a charwoman.) In fact, Digory, you are now talking to the last man (possibly) who really had a fairy godmother. There! That’ll be something for you to remember when you are an old man yourself.”

“I bet she was a bad fairy,” thought Digory; and added out loud. “But what about Polly?”

“How you do harp on that!” said Uncle Andrew. “As if that was what mattered! My first task was of course to study the box itself. It was very ancient. And I knew enough even then to know that it wasn’t Greek, or Old Egyptian, or Babylonian, or Hittite, or Chinese. It was older than any of those nations. Ah—that was a great day when I at last found out the truth. The box was Atlantean; it came from the lost island of Atlantis. That meant it was centuries older than any of the stone-age things they dig up in Europe. And it wasn’t a rough, crude thing like them either. For in the very dawn of time Atlantis was already a great city with palaces and temples and learned men.”

He paused for a moment as if he expected Digory to say something. But Digory was disliking his Uncle more every minute, so he said nothing.

“Meanwhile,” continued Uncle Andrew, “I was learning a good deal in other ways (it wouldn’t be proper to explain them to a child) about Magic in general. That meant that I came to have a fair idea what sort of things might be in the box. By various tests I narrowed down the possibilities. I had to get to know some—well, some devilish queer people, and go through some very disagreeable experiences. That was what turned my head grey. One doesn’t become a magician for nothing. My health broke down in the end. But I got better. And at last I actually knew.”

Although there was not really the least chance of anyone overhearing them, he leaned forward and almost whispered as he said:

“The Atlantean box contained something that had been brought from another world when our world was only just beginning.”

“What?” asked Digory, who was now interested in spite of himself.

“Only dust,” said Uncle Andrew. “Fine, dry dust. Nothing much to look at. Not much to show for a lifetime of toil, you might say. Ah, but when I looked at that dust (I took jolly good care not to touch it) and thought that every grain had once been in another world—I don’t mean another planet, you know; they’re part of our world and you could get to them if you went far enough—but a really Other World—another Nature—another universe—somewhere you would never reach even if you travelled through the space of this universe for ever and ever—a world that could be reached only by Magic—well!” Here Uncle Andrew rubbed his hands till his knuckles cracked like fireworks.

“I knew,” he went on, “that if only you could get it into the right form, that dust would draw you back to the place it had come from. But the difficulty was to get it into the right form. My earlier experiments were all failures. I tried them on guinea-pigs. Some of them only died. Some exploded like little bombs—”

“It was a jolly cruel thing to do,” said Digory who had once had a guinea-pig of his own.

“How do you keep getting off the point!” said Uncle Andrew. “That’s what the creatures were for. I’d bought them myself. Let me see—where was I? Ah yes. At last I succeeded in making the rings: the yellow rings. But now a new difficulty arose. I was pretty sure, now, that a yellow ring would send any creature that touched it into the Other Place. But what would be the good of that if I couldn’t get them back to tell me what they had found there?”

“And what about them?” said Digory. “A nice mess they’d be in if they couldn’t get back!”

“You will keep on looking at everything from the wrong point of view,” said Uncle Andrew with a look of impatience. “Can’t you understand that the thing is a great experiment? The whole point of sending anyone into the Other Place is that I want to find out what it’s like.”

“Well why didn’t you go yourself then?”

Digory had hardly ever seen anyone so surprised and offended as his Uncle did at this simple question. “Me? Me?” he exclaimed. “The boy must be mad! A man at my time of life, and in my state of health, to risk the shock and the dangers of being flung suddenly into a different universe? I never heard anything so preposterous in my life! Do you realize what you’re saying? Think what Another World means—you might meet anything—anything.”

“And I suppose you’ve sent Polly into it then,” said Digory. His cheeks were flaming with anger now. “And all I can say,” he added, “even if you are my Uncle—is that you’ve behaved like a coward, sending a girl to a place you’re afraid to go to yourself.”

“Silence, sir!” said Uncle Andrew, bringing his hand down on the table. “I will not be talked to like that by a little, dirty schoolboy. You don’t understand. I am the great scholar, the magician, the adept, who is doing the experiment. Of course I need subjects to do it on. Bless my soul, you’ll be telling me next that I ought to have asked the guinea-pigs’ permission before I used them! No great wisdom can be reached without sacrifice. But the idea of my going myself is ridiculous. It’s like asking a general to fight as a common soldier. Supposing I got killed, what would become of my life’s work?”

“Oh, do stop jawing,” said Digory. “Are you going to bring Polly back?”

“I was going to tell you, when you so rudely interrupted me,” said Uncle Andrew, “that I did at last find out a way of doing the return journey. The green rings draw you back.”

“But Polly hasn’t got a green ring.”

“No,” said Uncle Andrew with a cruel smile.

“Then she can’t get back,” shouted Digory. “And it’s exactly the same as if you’d murdered her.”

“She can get back,” said Uncle Andrew, “if someone else will go after her, wearing a yellow ring himself and taking two green rings, one to bring himself back and one to bring her back.”

And now of course Digory saw the trap in which he was caught; and he stared at Uncle Andrew, saying nothing, with his mouth wide open. His cheeks had gone very pale.

“I hope,” said Uncle Andrew presently in a very high and mighty voice, just as if he were a perfect Uncle who had given one a handsome tip and some good advice, “I hope, Digory, you are not given to showing the white feather. I should be very sorry to think that anyone of our family had not enough honour and chivalry to go to the aid of—er—a lady in distress.”

“Oh shut up!” said Digory. “If you had any honour and all that, you’d be going yourself. But I know you won’t. Alright. I see I’ve got to go. But you are a beast. I suppose you planned the whole thing, so that she’d go without knowing it and then I’d have to go after her.”

“Of course,” said Uncle Andrew with his hateful smile.

“Very well. I’ll go. But there’s one thing I jolly well mean to say first. I didn’t believe in Magic till today. I see now it’s real. Well if it is, I suppose all the old fairy tales are more or less true. And you’re simply a wicked, cruel magician like the ones in the stories. Well, I’ve never read a story in which people of that sort weren’t paid out in the end, and I bet you will be. And serve you right.”

Of all the things Digory had said this was the first that really went home. Uncle Andrew started and there came over his face a look of such horror that, beast though he was, you could almost feel sorry for him. But a second later he smoothed it all away and said with a rather forced laugh, “Well, well, I suppose that is a natural thing for a child to think—brought up among women, as you have been. Old wives’ tales, eh? I don’t think you need worry about my danger, Digory. Wouldn’t it be better to worry about the danger of your little friend? She’s been gone some time. If there are any dangers Over There—well, it would be a pity to arrive a moment too late.”

“A lot you care,” said Digory fiercely. “But I’m sick of this jaw. What have I got to do?”

“You really must learn to control that temper of yours, my boy,” said Uncle Andrew coolly. “Otherwise you’ll grow up like your Aunt Letty. Now. Attend to me.”

He got up, put on a pair of gloves, and walked over to the tray that contained the rings.

“They only work,” he said, “if they’re actually touching your skin. Wearing gloves, I can pick them up—like this—and nothing happens. If you carried one in your pocket nothing would happen; but of course you’d have to be careful not to put your hand in your pocket and touch it by accident. The moment you touch a yellow ring, you vanish out of this world. When you are in the Other Place I expect—of course this hasn’t been tested yet, but I expect—that the moment you touch a green ring you vanish out of that world and—I expect—reappear in this. Now. I take these two greens and drop them into your right-hand pocket. Remember very carefully which pocket the greens are in. G for green and R for right. G.R. you see: which are the first two letters of green. One for you and one for the little girl. And now you pick up a yellow one for yourself. I should put it on on—your finger—if I were you. There’ll be less chance of dropping it.”

Digory had almost picked up the yellow ring when he suddenly checked himself.

“Look here,” he said. “What about Mother? Supposing she asks where I am?”

“The sooner you go, the sooner you’ll be back,” said Uncle Andrew cheerfully.

“But you don’t really know whether I can get back.”

Uncle Andrew shrugged his shoulders, walked across to the door, unlocked it, threw it open, and said:

“Oh very well then. Just as you please. Go down and have your dinner. Leave the little girl to be eaten by wild animals or drowned or starved in Otherworld or lost there for good, if that’s what you prefer. It’s all one to me. Perhaps before tea time you’d better drop in on Mrs. Plummer and explain that she’ll never see her daughter again; because you were afraid to put on a ring.”

“By gum,” said Digory, “don’t I just wish I was big enough to punch your head!”

Then he buttoned up his coat, took a deep breath, and picked up the ring. And he thought then, as he always thought afterwards too, that he could not decently have done anything else.





Chapter 3　THE WOOD BETWEEN THE WORLDS


Uncle Andrew and his study vanished instantly. Then, for a moment, everything became muddled. The next thing Digory knew was that there was a soft green light coming down on him from above, and darkness below. He didn’t seem to be standing on anything, or sitting, or lying. Nothing appeared to be touching him. “I believe I’m in water,” said Digory. “Or under water.” This frightened him for a second, but almost at once he could feel that he was rushing upwards. Then his head suddenly came out into the air and he found himself scrambling ashore, out on to smooth grassy ground at the edge of a pool.

As he rose to his feet he noticed that he was neither dripping nor panting for breath as anyone would expect after being under water. His clothes were perfectly dry. He was standing by the edge of a small pool—not more than ten feet from side to side—in a wood. The trees grew close together and were so leafy that he could get no glimpse of the sky. All the light was green light that came through the leaves; but there must have been a very strong sun overhead, for this green daylight was bright and warm. It was the quietest wood you could possibly imagine. There were no birds, no insects, no animals, and no wind. You could almost feel the trees growing. The pool he had just got out of was not the only pool. There were dozens of others—a pool every few yards as far as his eyes could reach. You could almost feel the trees drinking the water up with their roots. This wood was very much alive. When he tried to describe it afterwards Digory always said, “It was a rich place: as rich as plumcake.”

The strangest thing was that, almost before he had looked about him, Digory had half forgotten how he had come there. At any rate, he was certainly not thinking about Polly, or Uncle Andrew, or even his Mother. He was not in the least frightened, or excited, or curious. If anyone had asked him “Where did you come from?” he would probably have said, “I’ve always been here.” That was what it felt like—as if one had always been in that place and never been bored although nothing had ever happened. As he said long afterwards, “It’s not the sort of place where things happen. The trees go on growing, that’s all.”

After Digory had looked at the wood for a long time he noticed that there was a girl lying on her back at the foot of a tree a few yards away. Her eyes were nearly shut but not quite, as if she were just between sleeping and waking. So he looked at her for a long time and said nothing. And at last she opened her eyes and looked at him for a long time and she also said nothing. Then she spoke, in a dreamy, contented sort of voice.

“I think I’ve seen you before,” she said.

“I rather think so too,” said Digory. “Have you been here long?”

“Oh, always,” said the girl. “At least—I don’t know a very long time.”

“So have I,” said Digory.

“No you haven’t,” said she. “I’ve just seen you come up out of that pool.”

“Yes, I suppose I did,” said Digory with a puzzled air, “I’d forgotten.”

Then for quite a long time neither said any more.

“Look here,” said the girl presently, “I wonder did we ever really meet before? I had a sort of idea—a sort of picture in my head—of a boy and a girl, like us—living somewhere quite different—and doing all sorts of things. Perhaps it was only a dream.”

“I’ve had that same dream, I think,” said Digory. “About a boy and a girl, living next door—and something about crawling among rafters. I remember the girl had a dirty face.”

“Aren’t you getting it mixed? In my dream it was the boy who had the dirty face.”

“I can’t remember the boy’s face,” said Digory, and then added. “Hullo! What’s that?”

“Why! it’s a guinea-pig,” said the girl. And it was—a fat guinea-pig, nosing about in the grass. But round the middle of the guinea-pig there ran a tape, and, tied on to it by the tape, was a bright yellow ring.

“Look! look,” cried Digory. “The ring! And look! You’ve got one on your finger. And so have I.”

The girl now sat up, really interested at last. They stared very hard at one another, trying to remember. And then, at exactly the same moment, she shouted out “Mr. Ketterley” and he shouted out “Uncle Andrew,” and they knew who they were and began to remember the whole story. After a few minutes hard talking they had got it straight. Digory explained how beastly Uncle Andrew had been.

“What do we do now?” said Polly. “Take the guinea-pig and go home?”

“There’s no hurry,” said Digory with a huge yawn.

“I think there is,” said Polly. “This place is too quiet. It’s so—so dreamy. You’re almost asleep. If we once give in to it we shall just lie down and drowse for ever and ever.”

“It’s very nice here,” said Digory.

“Yes, it is,” said Polly. “But we’ve got to get back.” She stood up and began to go cautiously toward the guinea-pig. But then she changed her mind.

“We might as well leave the guinea-pig,” she said. “It’s perfectly happy here, and your uncle will only do something horrid to it if we take it home.”

“I bet he would,” answered Digory. “Look at the way he’s treated us. By the way, how do we get home?”

“Go back into the pool, I expect.”

They came and stood together at the edge looking down into the smooth water. It was full of the reflection of the green, leafy branches; they made it look very deep.

“We haven’t any bathing things,” said Polly.

“We shan’t need them, silly,” said Digory. “We’re going in with our clothes on. Don’t you remember it didn’t wet us on the way up?”

“Can you swim?”

“A bit. Can you?”

“Well—not much.”

“I don’t think we shall need to swim,” said Digory. “We want to go down, don’t we?”

Neither of them much liked the idea of jumping into that pool, but neither said so to the other. They took hands and said “One—Two—Three—Go” and jumped. There was a great splash and of course they closed their eyes. But when they opened them again they found they were still standing, hand in hand, in the green wood, and hardly up to their ankles in water. The pool was apparently only a couple of inches deep. They splashed back on to the dry ground.

“What on earth’s gone wrong?” said Polly in a frightened voice; but not quite so frightened as you might expect, because it is hard to feel really frightened in that wood. The place is too peaceful.

“Oh! I know,” said Digory. “Of course it won’t work. We’re still wearing our yellow rings. They’re for the outward journey, you know. The green ones take you home. We must change rings. Have you got pockets? Good. Put your yellow ring in your left. I’ve got two greens. Here’s one for you.”

They put on their green rings and came back to the pool. But before they tried another jump Digory gave a long “O-o-oh!”

“What’s the matter?” said Polly.

“I’ve just had a really wonderful idea,” said Digory. “What are all the other pools?”

“How do you mean?”

“Why, if we can get back to our own world by jumping into this pool, mightn’t we get somewhere else by jumping into one of the others? Supposing there was a world at the bottom of every pool.”

“But I thought we were already in your Uncle Andrew’s Other World or Other Place or whatever he called it. Didn’t you say—”

“Oh bother Uncle Andrew,” interrupted Digory. “I don’t believe he knows anything about it. He never had the pluck to come here himself. He only talked of one Other World. But suppose there were dozens?”

“You mean, this wood might be only one of them?”

“No, I don’t believe this wood is a world at all. I think it’s just a sort of in-between place.”

Polly looked puzzled.

“Don’t you see?” said Digory. “No, do listen. Think of our tunnel under the slates at home. It isn’t a room in any of the houses. In a way, it isn’t really part of any of the houses. But once you’re in the tunnel you can go along it and come out into any of the houses in the row. Mightn’t this wood be the same?—a place that isn’t in any of the worlds, but once you’ve found that place you can get into them all.”

“Well, even if you can—” began Polly, but Digory went on as if he hadn’t heard her.

“And of course that explains everything,” he said. “That’s why it is so quiet and sleepy here. Nothing ever happens here. Like at home. It’s in the houses that people talk, and do things, and have meals. Nothing goes on in the in-between places, behind the walls and above the ceilings and under the floor, or in our own tunnel. But when you come out of our tunnel you may find yourself in any house. I think we can get out of this place into jolly well Anywhere! We don’t need to jump back into the same pool we came up by. Or not just yet.”

“The Wood between the Worlds,” said Polly dreamily. “It sounds rather nice.”

“Come on,” said Digory. “Which pool shall we try?”

“Look here,” said Polly, “I’m not going to try any new pool till we’ve made sure that we can get back by the old one. We’re not even sure if it’ll work yet.”

“Yes,” said Digory. “And get caught by Uncle Andrew and have our rings taken away before we’ve had any fun. No thanks.”

“Couldn’t we just go part of the way down into our own pool,” said Polly. “Just to see if it works. Then if it does, we’ll change rings and come up again before we’re really back in Mr. Ketterley’s study.”

“Can we go part of the way down?”

“Well, it took time coming up. I suppose it’ll take a little time going back.”

Digory made rather a fuss about agreeing to this, but he had to in the end because Polly absolutely refused to do any exploring in new worlds until she had made sure about getting back to the old one. She was quite as brave as he about some dangers (wasps, for instance) but she was not so interested in finding out things nobody had ever heard of before; for Digory was the sort of person who wants to know everything, and when he grew up he became the famous Professor Kirke who comes into other books.

After a good deal of arguing they agreed to put on their green rings (“Green for safety,” said Digory, “so you can’t help remembering which is which”) and hold hands and jump. But as soon as they seemed to be getting back to Uncle Andrew’s study, or even to their own world, Polly was to shout “Change” and they would slip off their greens and put on their yellows. Digory wanted to be the one who shouted “Change” but Polly wouldn’t agree.

They put on the green rings, took hands, and once more shouted “One—Two—Three—Go.” This time it worked. It is very hard to tell you what it felt like, for everything happened so quickly. At first there were bright lights moving about in a black sky; Digory always thinks these were stars and even swears that he saw Jupiter quite close—close enough to see its moon. But almost at once there were rows and rows of roofs and chimney pots about them, and they could see St Paul’s and knew they were looking at London. But you could see through the walls of all the houses. Then they could see Uncle Andrew, very vague and shadowy, but getting clearer and more solid-looking all the time, just as if he were coming into focus. But before he became quite real Polly shouted “Change,” and they did change, and our world faded away like a dream, and the green light above grew stronger and stronger, till their heads came out of the pool and they scrambled ashore. And there was the wood all about them, as green and bright and still as ever. The whole thing had taken less than a minute.

“There!” said Digory. “That’s alright. Now for the adventure. Any pool will do. Come on. Let’s try that one.”

“Stop!” said Polly. “Aren’t we going to mark this pool?”

They stared at each other and turned quite white as they realized the dreadful thing that Digory had just been going to do. For there were any number of pools in the wood, and the pools were all alike and the trees were all alike, so that if they had once left behind the pool that led to our own world without making some sort of landmark, the chances would have been a hundred to one against their ever finding it again.

Digory’s hand was shaking as he opened his penknife and cut out a long strip of turf on the bank of the pool. The soil (which smelled nice) was of a rich reddish brown and showed up well against the green. “It’s a good thing one of us has some sense,” said Polly.

“Well don’t keep on gassing about it,” said Digory. “Come along, I want to see what’s in one of the other pools.” And Polly gave him a pretty sharp answer and he said something even nastier in reply. The quarrel lasted for several minutes but it would be dull to write it all down. Let us skip on to the moment at which they stood with beating hearts and rather scared faces on the edge of the unknown pool with their yellow rings on and held hands and once more said “One—Two—Three—Go!”

Splash! Once again it hadn’t worked. This pool, too, appeared to be only a puddle. Instead of reaching a new world they only got their feet wet and splashed their legs for the second time that morning (if it was a morning: it seems to be always the same time in the Wood between the Worlds).

“Blast and botheration!” exclaimed Digory. “What’s gone wrong now? We’ve put our yellow rings on all right. He said yellow for the outward journey.”

Now the truth was that Uncle Andrew, who knew nothing about the Wood between the Worlds, had quite a wrong idea about the rings. The yellow ones weren’t “outward” rings and the green ones weren’t “homeward” rings; at least, not in the way he thought. The stuff of which both were made had all come from the wood. The stuff in the yellow rings had the power of drawing you into the wood; it was stuff that wanted to get back to its own place, the in-between place. But the stuff in the green rings is stuff that is trying to get out of its own place: so that a green ring would take you out of the wood into a world. Uncle Andrew, you see, was working with things he did not really understand; most magicians are. Of course Digory did not realize the truth quite clearly either, or not till later. But when they had talked it over, they decided to try their green rings on the new pool, just to see what happened.

“I’m game if you are,” said Polly. But she really said this because, in her heart of hearts, she now felt sure that neither kind of ring was going to work at all in the new pool, and so there was nothing worse to be afraid of than another splash. I am not quite sure that Digory had not the same feeling. At any rate, when they had both put on their greens and come back to the edge of the water, and taken hands again, they were certainly a good deal more cheerful and less solemn than they had been the first time.

“One—Two—Three—Go!” said Digory. And they jumped.





Chapter 4　THE BELL AND THE HAMMER


There was no doubt about the Magic this time. Down and down they rushed, first through darkness and then through a mass of vague and whirling shapes which might have been almost anything. It grew lighter. Then suddenly they felt that they were standing on something solid. A moment later everything came into focus and they were able to look about them.

“What a queer place!” said Digory.

“I don’t like it,” said Polly with something like a shudder.

What they noticed first was the light. It wasn’t like sunlight, and it wasn’t like electric light, or lamps, or candles, or any other light they had ever seen. It was a dull, rather red light, not at all cheerful. It was steady and did not flicker. They were standing on a flat paved surface and buildings rose all around them. There was no roof overhead; they were in a sort of courtyard. The sky was extraordinarily dark—a blue that was almost black. When you had seen that sky you wondered that there should be any light at all.

“It’s very funny weather here,” said Digory. “I wonder if we’ve arrived just in time for a thunderstorm; or an eclipse.”

“I don’t like it,” said Polly.

Both of them, without quite knowing why, were talking in whispers. And though there was no reason why they should still go on holding hands after their jump, they didn’t let go.

The walls rose very high all round that courtyard. They had many great windows in them, windows without glass, through which you saw nothing but black darkness. Lower down there were great pillared arches, yawning blackly like the mouths of railway tunnels. It was rather cold.

The stone of which everything was built seemed to be red, but that might only be because of the curious light. It was obviously very old. Many of the flat stones that paved the courtyard had cracks across them. None of them fitted closely together and the sharp corners were all worn off. One of the arched doorways was half filled up with rubble. The two children kept on turning round and round to look at the different sides of the courtyard. One reason was that they were afraid of somebody—or something—looking out of those windows at them when their backs were turned.

“Do you think anyone lives here?” said Digory at last, still in a whisper.

“No,” said Polly. “It’s all in ruins. We haven’t heard a sound since we came.”

“Let’s stand still and listen for a bit,” suggested Digory.

They stood still and listened, but all they could hear was the thump—thump of their own hearts. This place was at least as quiet as the Wood between the Worlds. But it was a different kind of quietness. The silence of the Wood had been rich and warm (you could almost hear the trees growing) and full of life; this was a dead, cold, empty silence. You couldn’t imagine anything growing in it.

“Let’s go home,” said Polly.

“But we haven’t seen anything yet,” said Digory. “Now we’re here, we simply must have a look round.”

“I’m sure there’s nothing at all interesting here.”

“There’s not much point in finding a magic ring that lets you into other worlds if you’re afraid to look at them when you’ve got there.”

“Who’s talking about being afraid?” said Polly, letting go of Digory’s hand.

“I only thought you didn’t seem very keen on exploring this place.”

“I’ll go anywhere you go.”

“We can get away the moment we want to,” said Digory. “Let’s take off our green rings and put them in our right-hand pockets. All we’ve got to do is to remember that our yellow are in our left-hand pockets. You can keep your hand as near your pocket as you like, but don’t put it in or you’ll touch your yellow and vanish.”

They did this and went quietly up to one of the big arched doorways which led into the inside of the building. And when they stood on the threshold and could look in, they saw it was not so dark inside as they had thought at first. It led into a vast, shadowy hall which appeared to be empty; but on the far side there was a row of pillars with arches between them and through those arches there streamed in some more of the same tired-looking light. They crossed the hall, walking very carefully for fear of holes in the floor or of anything lying about that they might trip over. It seemed a long walk. When they had reached the other side they came out through the arches and found themselves in another and larger courtyard.

“That doesn’t look very safe,” said Polly, pointing at a place where the wall bulged outward and looked as if it were ready to fall over into the courtyard. In one place a pillar was missing between two arches and the bit that came down to where the top of the pillar ought to have been hung there with nothing to support it. Clearly, the place had been deserted for hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.

“If it’s lasted till now, I suppose it’ll last a bit longer,” said Digory. “But we must be very quiet. You know a noise sometimes brings things down—like an avalanche in the Alps.”

They went on out of that courtyard into another doorway, and up a great flight of steps and through vast rooms that opened out of one another till you were dizzy with the mere size of the place. Every now and then they thought they were going to get out into the open and see what sort of country lay around the enormous palace. But each time they only got into another courtyard. They must have been magnificent places when people were still living there. In one there had once been a fountain. A great stone monster with wide-spread wings stood with its mouth open and you could still see a bit of piping at the back of its mouth, out of which the water used to pour. Under it was a wide stone basin to hold the water; but it was as dry as a bone. In other places there were the dry sticks of some sort of climbing plant which had wound itself round the pillars and helped to pull some of them down. But it had died long ago. And there were no ants or spiders or any of the other living things you expect to see in a ruin; and where the dry earth showed between the broken flagstones there was no grass or moss.

It was all so dreary and all so much the same that even Digory was thinking they had better put on their yellow rings and get back to the warm, green, living forest of the In-between place, when they came to two huge doors of some metal that might possibly be gold. One stood a little ajar. So of course they went to look in. Both started back and drew a long breath: for here at last was something worth seeing.

For a second they thought the room was full of people—hundreds of people, all seated, and all perfectly still. Polly and Digory, as you may guess, stood perfectly still themselves for a good long time, looking in. But presently they decided that what they were looking at could not be real people. There was not a movement nor the sound of a breath among them all. They were like the most wonderful waxworks you ever saw.

This time Polly took the lead. There was something in this room which interested her more than it interested Digory: all the figures were wearing magnificent clothes. If you were interested in clothes at all, you could hardly help going in to see them closer. And the blaze of their colours made this room look, not exactly cheerful, but at any rate rich and majestic after all the dust and emptiness of the others. It had more windows, too, and was a good deal lighter.

I can hardly describe the clothes. The figures were all robed and had crowns on their heads. Their robes were of crimson and silvery grey and deep purple and vivid green: and there were patterns, and pictures of flowers and strange beasts, in needlework all over them. Precious stones of astonishing size and brightness stared from their crowns and hung in chains round their necks and peeped out from all the places where anything was fastened.

“Why haven’t these clothes all rotted away long ago?” asked Polly.

“Magic,” whispered Digory. “Can’t you feel it? I bet this whole room is just stiff with enchantments. I could feel it the moment we came in.”

“Any one of these dresses would cost hundreds of pounds,” said Polly.

But Digory was more interested in the faces, and indeed these were well worth looking at. The people sat in their stone chairs on each side of the room and the floor was left free down the middle. You could walk down and look at the faces in turn.

“They were nice people, I think,” said Digory.

Polly nodded. All the faces they could see were certainly nice. Both the men and women looked kind and wise, and they seemed to come of a handsome race. But after the children had gone a few steps down the room they came to faces that looked a little different. These were very solemn faces. You felt you would have to mind your P’s and Q’s, if you ever met living people who looked like that. When they had gone a little further, they found themselves among faces they didn’t like: this was about the middle of the room. The faces here looked very strong and proud and happy, but they looked cruel. A little further on they looked crueller. Further on again, they were still cruel but they no longer looked happy. They were even despairing faces: as if the people they belonged to had done dreadful things and also suffered dreadful things. The last figure of all was the most interesting—a woman even more richly dressed than the others, very tall (but every figure in that room was taller than the people of our world), with a look of such fierceness and pride that it took your breath away. Yet she was beautiful too. Years afterwards when he was an old man, Digory said he had never in all his life known a woman so beautiful. It is only fair to add that Polly always said she couldn’t see anything specially beautiful about her.

This woman, as I said, was the last; but there were plenty of empty chairs beyond her, as if the room had been intended for a much larger collection of images.

“I do wish we knew the story that’s behind all this,” said Digory. “Let’s go back and look at that table sort of thing in the middle of the room.”

The thing in the middle of the room was not exactly a table. It was a square pillar about four feet high and on it there rose a little golden arch from which there hung a little golden bell; and beside this there lay a little golden hammer to hit the bell with.

“I wonder... I wonder... I wonder...” said Digory.

“There seems to be something written here,” said Polly, stooping down and looking at the side of the pillar.

“By gum, so there is,” said Digory. “But of course we shan’t be able to read it.”

“Shan’t we? I’m not so sure,” said Polly.

They both looked at it hard and, as you might have expected, the letters cut in the stone were strange. But now a great wonder happened: for, as they looked, though the shape of the strange letters never altered, they found that they could understand them. If only Digory had remembered what he himself had said a few minutes ago, that this was an enchanted room, he might have guessed that the enchantment was beginning to work. But he was too wild with curiosity to think about that. He was longing more and more to know what was written on the pillar. And very soon they both knew. What it said was something like this—at least this is the sense of it though the poetry, when you read it there, was better:

Make your choice, adventurous Stranger;

Strike the bell and bide the danger,

Or wonder, till it drives you mad,

What would have followed if you had.

“No fear!” said Polly. “We don’t want any danger.”

“Oh but don’t you see it’s no good!” said Digory. “We can’t get out of it now. We shall always be wondering what else would have happened if we had struck the bell. I’m not going home to be driven mad by always thinking of that. No fear!”

“Don’t be so silly,” said Polly. “As if anyone would! What does it matter what would have happened?”

“I expect anyone who’s come as far as this is bound to go on wondering till it sends him dotty. That’s the Magic of it, you see. I can feel it beginning to work on me already.”

“Well I don’t,” said Polly crossly. “And I don’t believe you do either. You’re just putting it on.”

“That’s all you know,” said Digory. “It’s because you’re a girl. Girls never want to know anything but gossip and rot about people getting engaged.”

“You looked exactly like your Uncle when you said that,” said Polly.

“Why can’t you keep to the point?” said Digory. “What we’re talking about is—”

“How exactly like a man!” said Polly in a very grownup voice; but she added hastily, in her real voice. “And don’t say I’m just like a woman, or you’ll be a beastly copy-cat.”

“I should never dream of calling a kid like you a woman,” said Digory loftily.

“Oh, I’m a kid, am I?” said Polly who was now in a real rage. “Well you needn’t be bothered by having a kid with you any longer then. I’m off. I’ve had enough of this place. And I’ve had enough of you too—you beastly, stuck-up, obstinate pig!”

“None of that!” said Digory in a voice even nastier than he meant it to be; for he saw Polly’s hand moving to her pocket to get hold of her yellow ring. I can’t excuse what he did next except by saying that he was very sorry for it afterwards (and so were a good many other people). Before Polly’s hand reached her pocket, he grabbed her wrist, leaning across with his back against her chest. Then, keeping her other arm out of the way with his other elbow, he leaned forward, picked up the hammer, and struck the golden bell a light, smart tap. Then he let her go and they fell apart staring at each other and breathing hard. Polly was just beginning to cry, not with fear, and not even because he had hurt her wrist quite badly, but with furious anger. Within two seconds, however, they had something to think about that drove their own quarrels quite out of their minds.

As soon as the bell was struck it gave out a note, a sweet note such as you might have expected, and not very loud. But instead of dying away again, it went on; and as it went on it grew louder. Before a minute had passed it was twice as loud as it had been to begin with. It was soon so loud that if the children had tried to speak (but they weren’t thinking of speaking now—they were just standing with their mouths open) they would not have heard one another. Very soon it was so loud that they could not have heard one another even by shouting. And still it grew: all on one note, a continuous sweet sound, though the sweetness had something horrible about it, till all the air in that great room was throbbing with it and they could feel the stone floor trembling under their feet. Then at last it began to be mixed with another sound, a vague, disastrous noise which sounded first like the roar of a distant train, and then like the crash of a falling tree. They heard something like great weights falling. Finally, with a sudden rush and thunder, and a shake that nearly flung them off their feet, about a quarter of the roof at one end of the room fell in, great blocks of masonry fell all round them, and the walls rocked. The noise of the bell stopped. The clouds of dust cleared away. Everything became quiet again.

It was never found out whether the fall of the roof was due to Magic or whether that unbearably loud sound from the bell just happened to strike the note which was more than those crumbling walls could stand.

“There! I hope you’re satisfied now,” panted Polly.

“Well, it’s all over, anyway,” said Digory.

And both thought it was; but they had never been more mistaken in their lives.





Chapter 5　THE DEPLORABLE WORD


The children were facing one another across the pillar where the bell hung, still trembling, though it no longer gave out any note. Suddenly they heard a soft noise from the end of the room which was still undamaged. They turned quick as lightning to see what it was. One of the robed figures, the furthest-off one of all, the woman whom Digory thought so beautiful, was rising from its chair. When she stood up they realized that she was even taller than they had thought. And you could see at once, not only from her crown and robes, but from the flash of her eyes and the curve of her lips, that she was a great queen. She looked round the room and saw the damage and saw the children, but you could not guess from her face what she thought of either or whether she was surprised. She came forward with long, swift strides.

“Who has awaked me? Who has broken the spell?” she asked.

“I think it must have been me,” said Digory.

“You!” said the Queen, laying her hand on his shoulder—a white, beautiful hand, but Digory could feel that it was strong as steel pincers. “You? But you are only a child, a common child. Anyone can see at a glance that you have no drop of royal or noble blood in your veins. How did such as you dare to enter this house?”

“We’ve come from another world; by Magic,” said Polly, who thought it was high time the Queen took some notice of her as well as of Digory.

“Is this true?” said the Queen, still looking at Digory and not giving Polly even a glance.

“Yes, it is,” said he.

The Queen put her other hand under his chin and forced it up so that she could see his face better. Digory tried to stare back but he soon had to let his eyes drop. There was something about hers that overpowered him. After she had studied him for well over a minute, she let go of his chin and said:

“You are no magician. The Mark of it is not on you. You must be only the servant of a magician. It is on another’s Magic that you have travelled here.”

“It was my Uncle Andrew,” said Digory.

At the moment, not in the room itself but from somewhere very close, there came, first a rumbling, then a creaking, and then a roar of falling masonry, and the floor shook.

“There is great peril here,” said the Queen. “The whole palace is breaking up. If we are not out of it in a few minutes we shall be buried under the ruin.” She spoke as calmly as if she had been merely mentioning the time of day. “Come,” she added, and held out a hand to each of the children. Polly, who was disliking the Queen and feeling rather sulky, would not have let her hand be taken if she could have helped it. But though the Queen spoke so calmly, her movements were as quick as thought. Before Polly knew what was happening her left hand had been caught in a hand so much larger and stronger than her own that she could do nothing about it.

“This is a terrible woman,” thought Polly. “She’s strong enough to break my arm with one twist. And now that she’s got my left hand I can’t get at my yellow ring. If I tried to stretch across and get my right hand into my left pocket I mightn’t be able to reach it, before she asked me what I was doing. Whatever happens we mustn’t let her know about the rings. I do hope Digory has the sense to keep his mouth shut. I wish I could get a word with him alone.”

The Queen led them out of the Hall of Images into a long corridor and then through a whole maze of halls and stairs and courtyards. Again and again they heard parts of the great palace collapsing, sometimes quite close to them. Once a huge arch came thundering down only a moment after they had passed through it. The Queen was walking quickly—the children had to trot to keep up with her—but she showed no sign of fear. Digory thought, “She’s wonderfully brave. And strong. She’s what I call a Queen! I do hope she’s going to tell us the story of this place.”

She did tell them certain things as they went along:

“That is the door to the dungeons,” she would say, or “That passage leads to the principal torture chambers,” or “This was the old banqueting hall where my greatgrandfather bade seven hundred nobles to a feast and killed them all before they had drunk their fill. They had had rebellious thoughts.”

They came at last into a hall larger and loftier than any they had yet seen. From its size and from the great doors at the far end, Digory thought that now at last they must be coming to the main entrance. In this he was quite right. The doors were dead black, either ebony or some black metal which is not found in our world. They were fastened with great bars, most of them too high to reach and all too heavy to lift. He wondered how they would get out.

The Queen let go of his hand and raised her arm. She drew herself up to her full height and stood rigid. Then she said something which they couldn’t understand (but it sounded horrid) and made an action as if she were throwing something toward the doors. And those high and heavy doors trembled for a second as if they were made of silk and then crumbled away till there was nothing left of them but a heap of dust on the threshold.

“Whew!” whistled Digory.

“Has your master magician, your uncle, power like mine?” asked the Queen, firmly seizing Digory’s hand again. “But I shall know later. In the meantime, remember what you have seen. This is what happens to things, and to people, who stand in my way.”

Much more light than they had yet seen in that country was pouring in through the now empty doorway, and when the Queen led them out through it they were not surprised to find themselves in the open air. The wind that blew in their faces was cold, yet somehow stale. They were looking from a high terrace and there was a great landscape out below them.

Low down and near the horizon hung a great, red sun, far bigger than our sun. Digory felt at once that it was also older than ours: a sun near the end of its life, weary of looking down upon that world. To the left of the sun, and higher up, there was a single star, big and bright. Those were the only two things to be seen in the dark sky; they made a dismal group. And on the earth, in every direction, as far as the eye could reach, there spread a vast city in which there was no living thing to be seen. And all the temples, towers, palaces, pyramids, and bridges cast long, disastrous-looking shadows in the light of that withered sun. Once a great river had flowed through the city, but the water had long since vanished, and it was now only a wide ditch of grey dust.

“Look well on that which no eyes will ever see again,” said the Queen. “Such was Charn, that great city, the city of the King of Kings, the wonder of the world, perhaps of all worlds. Does your uncle rule any city as great as this, boy?”

“No,” said Digory. He was going to explain that Uncle Andrew didn’t rule any cities, but the Queen went on:

“It is silent now. But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the noises of Charn; the trampling of feet, the creaking of wheels, the cracking of the whips and the groaning of slaves, the thunder of chariots, and the sacrificial drums beating in the temples. I have stood here (but that was near the end) when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of Charn ran red.” She paused and added. “All in one moment one woman blotted it out for ever.”

“Who?” said Digory in a faint voice; but he had already guessed the answer.

“I,” said the Queen. “I, Jadis the last Queen, but the Queen of the World.”

The two children stood silent, shivering in the cold wind.

“It was my sister’s fault,” said the Queen. “She drove me to it. May the curse of all the Powers rest upon her forever! At any moment I was ready to make peace—yes and to spare her life too, if only she would yield me the throne. But she would not. Her pride has destroyed the whole world. Even after the war had begun, there was a solemn promise that neither side would use Magic. But when she broke her promise, what could I do? Fool! As if she did not know that I had more Magic than she! She even knew that I had the secret of the Deplorable Word. Did she think—she was always a weakling—that I would not use it?”

“What was it?” said Digory.

“That was the secret of secrets,” said the Queen Jadis. “It had long been known to the great kings of our race that there was a word which, if spoken with the proper ceremonies, would destroy all living things except the one who spoke it. But the ancient kings were weak and soft-hearted and bound themselves and all who should come after them with great oaths never even to seek after the knowledge of that word. But I learned it in a secret place and paid a terrible price to learn it. I did not use it until she forced me to it. I fought to overcome her by every other means. I poured out the blood of my armies like water—”

“Beast!” muttered Polly.

“The last great battle,” said the Queen, “raged for three days here in Charn itself. For three days I looked down upon it from this very spot. I did not use my power till the last of my soldiers had fallen, and the accursed woman, my sister, at the head of her rebels was halfway up those great stairs that lead up from the city to the terrace. Then I waited till we were so close that we could see one another’s faces. She flashed her horrible, wicked eyes upon me and said, ‘Victory.’ ‘Yes,’ said I, ‘Victory, but not yours.’ Then I spoke the Deplorable Word. A moment later I was the only living thing beneath the sun.”

“But the people?” gasped Digory.

“What people, boy?” asked the Queen.

“All the ordinary people,” said Polly, “who’d never done you any harm. And the women, and the children, and the animals.”

“Don’t you understand?” said the Queen (still speaking to Digory). “I was the Queen. They were all my people. What else were they there for but to do my will?”

“It was rather hard luck on them, all the same,” said he.

“I had forgotten that you are only a common boy. How should you understand reasons of State? You must learn, child, that what would be wrong for you or for any of the common people is not wrong in a great Queen such as I. The weight of the world is on our shoulders. We must be freed from all rules. Ours is a high and lonely destiny.”

Digory suddenly remembered that Uncle Andrew had used exactly the same words. But they sounded much grander when Queen Jadis said them; perhaps because Uncle Andrew was not seven feet tall and dazzlingly beautiful.

“And what did you do then?” said Digory.

“I had already cast strong spells on the hall where the images of my ancestors sit. And the force of those spells was that I should sleep among them, like an image myself, and need neither food nor fire, though it were a thousand years, till one came and struck the bell and awoke me.”

“Was it the Deplorable Word that made the sun like that?” asked Digory.

“Like what?” said Jadis.

“So big, so red, and so cold.”

“It has always been so,” said Jadis. “At least, for hundreds of thousands of years. Have you a different sort of sun in your world?”

“Yes, it’s smaller and yellower. And it gives a good deal more heat.”

The Queen gave a long drawn “A—a—ah!” And Digory saw on her face that same hungry and greedy look which he had lately seen on Uncle Andrew’s. “So,” she said, “yours is a younger world.”

She paused for a moment to look once more at the deserted city—and if she was sorry for all the evil she had done there, she certainly didn’t show it—and then said:

“Now, let us be going. It is cold here at the end of all the ages.”

“Going where?” asked both the children.

“Where?” repeated Jadis in surprise. “To your world, of course.”

Polly and Digory looked at each other, aghast. Polly had disliked the Queen from the first; and even Digory, now that he had heard the story, felt that he had seen quite as much of her as he wanted. Certainly, she was not at all the sort of person one would like to take home. And if they did like, they didn’t know how they could. What they wanted was to get away themselves; but Polly couldn’t get at her ring and of course Digory couldn’t go without her. Digory got very red in the face and stammered.

“Oh—oh—our world. I d-didn’t know you wanted to go there.”

“What else were you sent here for if not to fetch me?” asked Jadis.

“I’m sure you wouldn’t like our world at all,” said Digory. “It’s not her sort of place, is it Polly? It’s very dull; not worth seeing, really.”

“It will soon be worth seeing when I rule it,” answered the Queen.

“Oh, but you can’t,” said Digory. “It’s not like that. They wouldn’t let you, you know.”

The Queen gave a contemptuous smile. “Many great kings,” she said, “thought they could stand against the House of Charn. But they all fell, and their very names are forgotten. Foolish boy! Do you think that I, with my beauty and my Magic, will not have your whole world at my feet before a year has passed? Prepare your incantations and take me there at once.”

“This is perfectly frightful,” said Digory to Polly.

“Perhaps you fear for this Uncle of yours,” said Jadis. “But if he honours me duly, he shall keep his life and his throne. I am not coming to fight against him. He must be a very great Magician, if he has found how to send you here. Is he King of your whole world or only of part?”

“He isn’t King of anywhere,” said Digory.

“You are lying,” said the Queen. “Does not Magic always go with the royal blood? Who ever heard of common people being Magicians? I can see the truth whether you speak it or not. Your Uncle is the great King and the great Enchanter of your world. And by his art he has seen the shadow of my face, in some magic mirror or some enchanted pool; and for the love of my beauty he has made a potent spell which shook your world to its foundations and sent you across the vast gulf between world and world to ask my favour and to bring me to him. Answer me: is that not how it was?”

“Well, not exactly,” said Digory.

“Not exactly,” shouted Polly. “Why, it’s absolute bosh from beginning to end.”

“Minions!” cried the Queen, turning in rage upon Polly and seizing her hair, at the very top of her head where it hurts most. But in so doing she let go of both the children’s hands. “Now,” shouted Digory; and “Quick!” shouted Polly. They plunged their left hands into their pockets. They did not even need to put the rings on. The moment they touched them, the whole of that dreary world vanished from their eyes. They were rushing upward and a warm green light was growing nearer overhead.





Chapter 6　THE BEGINNING OF UNCLE ANDREW’S TROUBLES


“Let go! Let go!” screamed Polly.

“I’m not touching you!” said Digory.

Then their heads came out of the pool and, once more, the sunny quietness of the Wood between the Worlds was all about them, and it seemed richer and warmer and more peaceful than ever after the staleness and ruin of the place they had just left. I think that, if they had been given the chance, they would again have forgotten who they were and where they came from and would have lain down and enjoyed themselves, half asleep, listening to the growing of the trees. But this time there was something that kept them as wide-awake as possible: for as soon as they had got out on to the grass, they found that they were not alone. The Queen, or the Witch (whichever you like to call her) had come up with them, holding on fast by Polly’s hair. That was why Polly had been shouting out “Let go!”

This proved, by the way, another thing about the rings which Uncle Andrew hadn’t told Digory because he didn’t know it himself. In order to jump from world to world by using one of those rings you don’t need to be wearing or touching it yourself; it is enough if you are touching someone who is touching it. In that way they work like a magnet; and everyone knows that if you pick up a pin with a magnet, any other pin which is touching the first pin will come too.

Now that you saw her in the wood, Queen Jadis looked different. She was much paler than she had been; so pale that hardly any of her beauty was left. And she was stooped and seemed to be finding it hard to breathe, as if the air of that place stifled her. Neither of the children felt in the least afraid of her now.

“Let go! Let go of my hair,” said Polly. “What do you mean by it?”

“Here! Let go of her hair. At once,” said Digory.

They both turned and struggled with her. They were stronger than she and in a few seconds they had forced her to let go. She reeled back, panting, and there was a look of terror in her eyes.

“Quick, Digory!” said Polly. “Change rings and into the home pool.”

“Help! Help! Mercy!” cried the Witch in a faint voice, staggering after them. “Take me with you. You cannot mean to leave me in this horrible place. It is killing me.”

“It’s a reason of State,” said Polly spitefully. “Like when you killed all those people in your own world. Do be quick, Digory.” They had put on their green rings, but Digory said:

“Oh bother! What are we to do?” He couldn’t help feeling a little sorry for the Queen.

“Oh don’t be such an ass,” said Polly. “Ten to one she’s only shamming. Do come on.” And then both children plunged into the home pool. “It’s a good thing we made that mark,” thought Polly. But as they jumped Digory felt that a large cold finger and thumb had caught him by the ear. And as they sank down and the confused shapes of our own world began to appear, the grip of that finger and thumb grew stronger. The Witch was apparently recovering her strength. Digory struggled and kicked, but it was not of the least use. In a moment they found themselves in Uncle Andrew’s study; and there was Uncle Andrew himself, staring at the wonderful creature that Digory had brought back from beyond the world.

And well he might stare. Digory and Polly stared too. There was no doubt that the Witch had got over her faintness; and now that one saw her in our own world, with ordinary things around her, she fairly took one’s breath away. In Charn she had been alarming enough; in London, she was terrifying. For one thing, they had not realized till now how very big she was. “Hardly human” was what Digory thought when he looked at her; and he may have been right, for some say there is giantish blood in the royal family of Charn. But even her height was nothing compared with her beauty, her fierceness, and her wildness. She looked ten times more alive than most of the people one meets in London. Uncle Andrew was bowing and rubbing his hands and looking, to tell the truth, extremely frightened. He seemed a little shrimp of a creature beside the Witch. And yet, as Polly said afterward, there was a sort of likeness between her face and his, something in the expression. It was the look that all wicked Magicians have, the “Mark” which Jadis had said she could not find in Digory’s face. One good thing about seeing the two together was that you would never again be afraid of Uncle Andrew, any more than you’d be afraid of a worm after you had met a rattlesnake or afraid of a cow after you had met a mad bull.

“Pooh!” thought Digory to himself. “Him a Magician! Not much. Now she’s the real thing.”

Uncle Andrew kept on rubbing his hands and bowing. He was trying to say something very polite, but his mouth had gone all dry so that he could not speak. His “experiment” with the rings, as he called it, was turning out more successful than he liked: for though he had dabbled in Magic for years he had always left all the dangers (as far as one can) to other people. Nothing at all like this had ever happened to him before.

Then Jadis spoke; not very loud, but there was something in her voice that made the whole room quiver.

“Where is the Magician who has called me into this world?”

“Ah—ah—Madam,” gasped Uncle Andrew, “I am most honoured—highly gratified—a most unexpected pleasure—if only I had had the opportunity of making any preparations—I—I—”

“Where is the Magician, Fool?” said Jadis.

“I—I am, Madam. I hope you will excuse any—er—liberty these naughty children may have taken. I assure you, there was no intention—”

“You?” said the Queen in a still more terrible voice. Then, in one stride, she crossed the room, seized a great handful of Uncle Andrew’s grey hair and pulled his head back so that his face looked up into hers. Then she studied his face as she had studied Digory’s face in the palace of Charn. He blinked and licked his lips nervously all the time. At last she let him go: so suddenly that he reeled back against the wall.

“I see,” she said scornfully, “you are a Magician—of a sort. Stand up, dog, and don’t sprawl there as if you were speaking to your equals. How do you come to know Magic? You are not of royal blood, I’ll swear.”

“Well—ah—not perhaps in the strict sense,” stammered Uncle Andrew. “Not exactly royal, Ma’am. The Ketterleys are, however, a very old family. An old Dorsetshire family, Ma’am.”

“Peace,” said the Witch. “I see what you are. You are a little, peddling Magician who works by rules and books. There is no real Magic in your blood and heart. Your kind was made an end of in my world a thousand years ago. But here I shall allow you to be my servant.”

“I should be most happy—delighted to be of any service—a p-pleasure, I assure you.”

“Peace! You talk far too much. Listen to your first task. I see we are in a large city. Procure for me at once a chariot or a flying carpet or a well-trained dragon, or whatever is usual for royal and noble persons in your land. Then bring me to places where I can get clothes and jewels and slaves fit for my rank. Tomorrow I will begin the conquest of the world.”

“I—I—I’ll go and order a cab at once,” gasped Uncle Andrew.

“Stop,” said the Witch, just as he reached the door. “Do not dream of treachery. My eyes can see through walls and into the minds of men. They will be on you wherever you go. At the first sign of disobedience I will lay such spells on you that anything you sit down on will feel like red hot iron and whenever you lie in a bed there will be invisible blocks of ice at your feet. Now go.”

The old man went out, looking like a dog with its tail between its legs.

The children were now afraid that Jadis would have something to say to them about what had happened in the wood. As it turned out, however, she never mentioned it either then or afterwards. I think (and Digory thinks too) that her mind was of a sort which cannot remember that quiet place at all, and however often you took her there and however long you left her there, she would still know nothing about it. Now that she was left alone with the children, she took no notice of either of them. And that was like her too. In Charn she had taken no notice of Pony (till the very end) because Digory was the one she wanted to make use of. Now that she had Uncle Andrew, she took no notice of Digory. I expect most witches are like that. They are not interested in things or people unless they can use them; they are terribly practical. So there was silence in the room for a minute or two. But you could tell by the way Jadis tapped her foot on the floor that she was growing impatient.

Presently she said, as if to herself, “What is the old fool doing? I should have brought a whip.” She stalked out of the room in pursuit of Uncle Andrew without one glance at the children.

“Whew!” said Polly, letting out a long breath of relief. “And now I must get home. It’s frightfully late. I shall catch it.”

“Well do, do come back as soon as you can,” said Digory. “This is simply ghastly, having her here. We must make some sort of plan.”

“That’s up to your Uncle now,” said Polly. “It was he who started all this messing about with Magic.”

“All the same, you will come back, won’t you? Hang it all, you can’t leave me alone in a scrape like this.”

“I shall go home by the tunnel,” said Polly rather coldly. “That’ll be the quickest way. And if you want me to come back, hadn’t you better say you’re sorry?”

“Sorry?” exclaimed Digory. “Well now, if that isn’t just like a girl! What have I done?”

“Oh nothing of course,” said Polly sarcastically. “Only nearly screwed my wrist off in that room with all the waxworks, like a cowardly bully. Only struck the bell with the hammer, like a silly idiot. Only turned back in the wood so that she had time to catch hold of you before we jumped into our own pool. That’s all.”

“Oh,” said Digory, very surprised. “Well, alright, I’ll say I’m sorry. And I really am sorry about what happened in the waxworks room. There: I’ve said I’m sorry. And now, do be decent and come back. I shall be in a frightful hole if you don’t.”

“I don’t see what’s going to happen to you. It’s Mr. Ketterley who’s going to sit on red hot chairs and have ice in his bed, isn’t it?”

“It isn’t that sort of thing,” said Digory. “What I’m bothered about is Mother. Suppose that creature went into her room. She might frighten her to death.”

“Oh, I see,” said Polly in rather a different voice. “Alright. We’ll call it Pax. I’ll come back—if I can. But I must go now.” And she crawled through the little door into the tunnel; and that dark place among the rafters which had seemed so exciting and adventurous a few hours ago, seemed quite tame and homely now.

We must now go back to Uncle Andrew. His poor old heart went pit-a-pat as he staggered down the attic stairs and he kept on dabbing at his forehead with a handkerchief. When he reached his bedroom, which was the floor below, he locked himself in. And the very first thing he did was to grope in his wardrobe for a bottle and a wine-glass which he always kept hidden there where Aunt Letty could not find them. He poured himself out a glassful of some nasty, grown-up drink and drank it off at one gulp. Then he drew a deep breath.

“Upon my word,” he said to himself. “I’m dreadfully shaken. Most upsetting! And at my time of life!”

He poured out a second glass and drank it too; then he began to change his clothes. You have never seen such clothes, but I can remember them. He put on a very high, shiny, stiff collar of the sort that made you hold your chin up all the time. He put on a white waistcoat with a pattern on it and arranged his gold watch chain across the front. He put on his best frock-coat, the one he kept for weddings and funerals. He got out his best tall hat and polished it up. There was a vase of flowers (put there by Aunt Letty) on his dressing table; he took one and put it in his button-hole. He took a clean handkerchief (a lovely one such as you couldn’t buy today) out of the little left-hand drawer and put a few drops of scent on it. He took his eye-glass, with the thick black ribbon, and screwed it into his eye; then he looked at himself in the mirror.

Children have one kind of silliness, as you know, and grown-ups have another kind. At this moment Uncle Andrew was beginning to be silly in a very grown-up way. Now that the Witch was no longer in the same room with him he was quickly forgetting how she had frightened him and thinking more and more of her wonderful beauty. He kept on saying to himself, “A dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman. A superb creature.” He had also somehow managed to forget that it was the children who had got hold of this “superb creature”: he felt as if he himself by his Magic had called her out of unknown worlds.

“Andrew, my boy,” he said to himself as he looked in the glass, “you’re a devilish well preserved fellow for your age. A distinguished-looking man, sir.”

You see, the foolish old man was actually beginning to imagine the Witch would fall in love with him. The two drinks probably had something to do with it, and so had his best clothes. But he was, in any case, as vain as a peacock; that was why he had become a Magician.

He unlocked the door, went downstairs, sent the housemaid out to fetch a hansom (everyone had lots of servants in those days) and looked into the drawingroom. There, as he expected, he found Aunt Letty. She was busily mending a mattress. It lay on the floor near the window and she was kneeling on it.

“Ah, Letitia, my dear,” said Uncle Andrew, “I—ah—have to go out. Just lend me five pounds or so, there’s a good gel.” (“Gel” was the way he pronounced girl.)

“No, Andrew dear,” said Aunty Letty in her firm, quiet voice, without looking up from her work. “I’ve told you times without number that I will not lend you money.”

“Now pray don’t be troublesome, my dear gel,” said Uncle Andrew. “It’s most important. You will put me in a deucedly awkward position if you don’t.”

“Andrew,” said Aunt Letty, looking him straight in the face, “I wonder you are not ashamed to ask me for money.”

There was a long, dull story of a grown-up kind behind these words. All you need to know about it is that Uncle Andrew, what with “managing dear Letty’s business matters for her,” and never doing any work, and running up large bills for brandy and cigars (which Aunt Letty had paid again and again) had made her a good deal poorer than she had been thirty years ago.

“My dear gel,” said Uncle Andrew, “you don’t understand. I shall have some quite unexpected expenses today. I have to do a little entertaining. Come now, don’t be tiresome.”

“And who, pray, are you going to entertain, Andrew?” asked Aunt Letty.

“A—a most distinguished visitor has just arrived.”

“Distinguished fiddlestick!” said Aunt Letty. “There hasn’t been a ring at the hell for the last hour.”

At that moment the door was suddenly flung open. Aunt Letty looked round and saw with amazement that an enormous woman, splendidly dressed, with bare arms and flashing eyes, stood in the doorway. It was the Witch.





Chapter 7　WHAT HAPPENED AT THE FRONT DOOR


“Now, slave, how long am I to wait for my chariot?” thundered the Witch. Uncle Andrew cowered away from her. Now that she was really present, all the silly thoughts he had had while looking at himself in the glass were oozing out of him. But Aunt Letty at once got up from her knees and came over to the centre of the room.

“And who is this young person, Andrew, may I ask?” said Aunt Letty in icy tones.

“Distinguished foreigner—v-very important p-person,” he stammered.

“Rubbish!” said Aunt Letty, and then, turning to the Witch. “Get out of my house this moment, you shameless hussy, or I’ll send for the police.” She thought the Witch must be someone out of a circus and she did not approve of bare arms.

“What woman is this?” said Jadis. “Down on your knees, minion, before I blast you.”

“No strong language in this house if you please, young woman,” said Aunt Letty.

Instantly, as it seemed to Uncle Andrew, the Queen towered up to an even greater height. Fire flashed from her eyes: she flung out her arm with the same gesture and the same horrible-sounding words that had lately turned the palace-gates of Charn to dust. But nothing happened except that Aunt Letty, thinking that those horrible words were meant to be ordinary English, said:

“I thought as much. The woman is drunk. Drunk! She can’t even speak clearly.”

It must have been a terrible moment for the Witch when she suddenly realized that her power of turning people into dust, which had been quite real in her own world, was not going to work in ours. But she did not lose her nerve even for a second. Without wasting a thought on her disappointment, she lunged forward, caught Aunt Letty round the neck and the knees, raised her high above her head as if she had been no heavier than a doll, and threw her across the room. While Aunt Letty was still hurtling through the air, the housemaid (who was having a beautifully exciting morning) put her head in at the door and said, “If you please, sir, the ’ansom’s come.”

“Lead on, Slave,” said the Witch to Uncle Andrew. He began muttering something about “regrettable violence—must really protest,” but at a single glance from Jadis he became speechless. She drove him out of the room and out of the house; and Digory came running down the stairs just in time to see the front door close behind them.

“Jiminy!” he said. “She’s loose in London. And with Uncle Andrew. I wonder what on earth is going to happen now.”

“Oh, Master Digory,” said the housemaid (who was really having a wonderful day), “I think Miss Ketterley’s hurt herself somehow.” So they both rushed into the drawing-room to find out what had happened.

If Aunt Letty had fallen on bare boards or even on the carpet, I suppose all her bones would have been broken: but by great good luck she had fallen on the mattress. Aunt Letty was a very tough old lady: aunts often were in those days. After she had had some sal volatile and sat still for a few minutes, she said there was nothing the matter with her except a few bruises. Very soon she was taking charge of the situation.

“Sarah,” she said to the housemaid (who had never had such a day before), “go around to the police station at once and tell them there is a dangerous lunatic at large. I will take Mrs. Kirke’s lunch up myself.” Mrs. Kirke was, of course, Digory’s mother.

When Mother’s lunch had been seen to, Digory and Aunt Letty had their own. After that he did some hard thinking.

The problem was how to get the Witch back to her own world, or at any rate out of ours, as soon as possible. Whatever happened, she must not be allowed to go rampaging about the house. Mother must not see her. And, if possible, she must not be allowed to go rampaging about London either. Digory had not been in the drawing-room when she tried to “blast” Aunt Letty, but he had seen her “blast” the gates at Charn: so he knew her terrible powers and did not know that she had lost any of them by coming into our world. And he knew she meant to conquer our world. At the present moment, as far as he could see, she might be blasting Buckingham Palace or the Houses of Parliament: and it was almost certain that quite a number of policemen had by now been reduced to little heaps of dust. And there didn’t seem to be anything he could do about that. “But the rings seem to work like magnets,” thought Digory. “If I can only touch her and then slip on my yellow, we shall both go into the Wood between the Worlds. I wonder will she go all faint again there? Was that something the place does to her, or was it only the shock of being pulled out of her own world? But I suppose I’ll have to risk that. And how am I to find the beast? I don’t suppose Aunt Letty would let me go out, not unless I said where I was going. And I haven’t got more than twopence. I’d need any amount of money for buses and trams if I went looking all over London. Anyway, I haven’t the faintest idea where to look. I wonder if Uncle Andrew is still with her.”

It seemed in the end that the only thing he could do was to wait and hope that Uncle Andrew and the Witch would come back. If they did, he must rush out and get hold of the Witch and put on his yellow Ring before she had a chance to get into the house. This meant that he must watch the front door like a cat watching a mouse’s hole; he dared not leave his post for a moment. So he went into the dining-room and “glued his face” as they say, to the window. It was a bow-window from which you could see the steps up to the front door and see up and down the street, so that no one could reach the front door without your knowing. “I wonder what Polly’s doing?” thought Digory.

He wondered about this a good deal as the first slow half-hour ticked on. But you need not wonder, for I am going to tell you. She had got home late for her dinner, with her shoes and stockings very wet. And when they asked her where she had been and what on earth she had been doing, she said she had been out with Digory Kirke. Under further questioning she said she had got her feet wet in a pool of water, and that the pool was in a wood. Asked where the wood was, she said she didn’t know. Asked if it was in one of the parks, she said truthfully enough that she supposed it might be a sort of park. From all of this Polly’s mother got the idea that Polly had gone off, without telling anyone, to some part of London she didn’t know, and gone into a strange park and amused herself jumping into puddles. As a result she was told that she had been very naughty indeed and that she wouldn’t be allowed to play with “that Kirke boy” any more if anything of the sort ever happened again. Then she was given dinner with all the nice parts left out and sent to bed for two solid hours. It was a thing that happened to one quite often in those days.

So while Digory was staring out of the dining-room window, Polly was lying in bed, and both were thinking how terribly slowly the time could go. I think, myself, I would rather have been in Polly’s position. She had only to wait for the end of her two hours: but every few minutes Digory would hear a cab or a baker’s van or a butcher’s boy coming round the corner and think “Here she comes,” and then find it wasn’t. And in between these false alarms, for what seemed hours and hours, the clock ticked on and one big fly—high up and far out of reach—buzzed against the window. It was one of those houses that get very quiet and dull in the afternoon and always seem to smell of mutton.

During his long watching and waiting one small thing happened which I shall have to mention because something important came of it later on. A lady called with some grapes for Digory’s Mother; and as the dining-room door was open, Digory couldn’t help overhearing Aunt Letty and the lady as they talked in the hall.

“What lovely grapes!” came Aunt Letty’s voice. “I’m sure if anything could do her good these would. But poor, dear little Mabel! I’m afraid it would need fruit from the land of youth to help her now. Nothing in this world will do much.” Then they both lowered their voices and said a lot more that he could not hear.

If he had heard that bit about the land of youth a few days ago he would have thought Aunt Letty was just talking without meaning anything in particular, the way grown-ups do, and it wouldn’t have interested him. He almost thought so now. But suddenly it flashed upon his mind that he now knew (even if Aunt Letty didn’t) that there really were other worlds and that he himself had been in one of them. At that rate there might be a real Land of Youth somewhere. There might be almost anything. There might be fruit in some other world that would really cure his mother! And oh, oh—Well, you know how it feels if you begin hoping for something that you want desperately badly; you almost fight against the hope because it is too good to be true; you’ve been disappointed so often before. That was how Digory felt. But it was no good trying to throttle this hope. It might—really, really, it just might be true. So many odd things had happened already. And he had the magic rings. There must be worlds you could get to through every pool in the wood. He could hunt through them all. And then—Mother well again. Everything right again. He forgot all about watching for the Witch. His hand was already going into the pocket where he kept the yellow ring, when all at once he heard a sound of galloping.

“Hullo! What’s that?” thought Digory. “Fire-engine? I wonder what house is on fire. Great Scott, it’s coming here. Why, it’s Her.”

I needn’t tell you who he meant by Her.

First came the hansom. There was no one in the driver’s seat. On the roof—not sitting, but standing on the roof—swaying with superb balance as it came at full speed round the corner with one wheel in the air—was Jadis the Queen of Queens and the Terror of Charn. Her teeth were bared, her eyes shone like fire, and her long hair streamed out behind her like a comet’s tail. She was flogging the horse without mercy. Its nostrils were wide and red and its sides were spotted with foam. It galloped madly up to the front door, missing the lamp-post by an inch, and then reared up on its hind legs. The hansom crashed into the lamp-post and shattered into several pieces. The Witch, with a magnificent jump, had sprung clear just in time and landed on the horse’s back. She settled herself astride and leaned forward, whispering things in its ear. They must have been things meant not to quiet it but to madden it. It was on its hind legs again in a moment, and its neigh was like a scream; it was all hoofs and teeth and eyes and tossing mane. Only a splendid rider could have stayed on its back.

Before Digory had recovered his breath a good many other things began to happen. A second hansom dashed up close behind the first: out of it there jumped a fat man in a frock-coat and a policeman. Then came a third hansom with two more policemen in it. After it, came about twenty people (mostly errand boys) on bicycles, all ringing their bells and letting out cheers and cat-calls. Last of all came a crowd of people on foot: all very hot with running, but obviously enjoying themselves. Windows shot up in all the houses of that street and a housemaid or a butler appeared at every front door. They wanted to see the fun.

Meanwhile an old gentleman had begun to struggle shakily out of the ruins of the first hansom. Several people rushed forward to help him; but as one pulled him one way and another another, perhaps he would have got out quite as quickly on his own. Digory guessed that the old gentleman must be Uncle Andrew but you couldn’t see his face; his tall hat had been bashed down over it.

Digory rushed out and joined the crowd.

“That’s the woman, that’s the woman,” cried the fat man, pointing at Jadis. “Do your duty, Constable. Hundreds and thousands of pounds’ worth she’s taken out of my shop. Look at that rope of pearls round her neck. That’s mine. And she’s given me a black eye too, what’s more.”

“That she ’as, guv’nor,” said one of the crowd. “And as lovely a black eye as I’d wish to see. Beautiful bit of work that must ’ave been. Gor! ain’t she strong then!”

“You ought to put a nice raw beefsteak on it, Mister, that’s what it wants,” said a butcher’s boy.

“Now then,” said the most important of the policemen, “what’s all this ’ere?”

“I tell you she—” began the fat man, when someone else called out:

“Don’t let the old cove in the cab get away. ’E put ’er up to it.”

The old gentleman, who was certainly Uncle Andrew, had just succeeded in standing up and was rubbing his bruises. “Now then,” said the policeman, turning to him. “What’s all this?”

“Womfle—pomfy—shomf,” came Uncle Andrew’s voice from inside the hat.

“None of that now,” said the policeman sternly. “You’ll find this is no laughing matter. Take that ’at off, see?”

This was more easily said than done. But after Uncle Andrew had struggled in vain with the hat for some time, two other policemen seized it by the brim and forced it off.

“Thank you, thank you,” said Uncle Andrew in a faint voice. “Thank you. Dear me, I’m terribly shaken. If someone could give me a small glass of brandy—”

“Now you attend to me, if you please,” said the policeman, taking out a very large note book and a very small pencil. “Are you in charge of that there young woman?”

“Look out!” called several voices, and the policeman jumped a step backward just in time. The horse had aimed a kick at him which would probably have killed him. Then the Witch wheeled the horse round so that she faced the crowd and its hind-legs were on the footpath. She had a long, bright knife in her hand and had been busily cutting the horse free from the wreck of the hansom.

All this time Digory had been trying to get into a position from which he could touch the Witch. This wasn’t at all easy because, on the side nearest to him, there were too many people. And in order to get round to the other side he had to pass between the horse’s hoofs and the railings of the “area” that surrounded the house; for the Ketterleys’ house had a basement. If you know anything about horses, and especially if you had seen what a state that horse was in at the moment, you will realize that this was a ticklish thing to do. Digory knew lots about horses, but he set his teeth and got ready to make a dash for it as soon as he saw a favourable moment.

A red-faced man in a bowler hat had now shouldered his way to the front of the crowd.

“Hi! P’leeceman,” he said, “that’s my ’orse what she’s sitting on, same as it’s my cab what she’s made matchwood of.”

“One at a time, please, one at a time,” said the policeman.

“But there ain’t no time,” said the Cabby. “I know that ’orse better’n you do. ’Tain’t an ordinary ’orse. ’Is father was a hofficer’s charger in the cavalry, ’e was. And if the young woman goes on hexcitin’ ’im, there’ll be murder done. ’Ere, let me get at him.”

The policeman was only too glad to have a good reason for standing further away from the horse. The Cabby took a step nearer, looked up at Jadis, and said in a not unkindly voice:

“Now, Missie, let me get at ’is ’ead, and just you get off. You’re a Lidy, and you don’t want all these roughs going for you, do you? You want to go ’ome and ’ave a nice cup of tea and a lay down quiet like; then you’ll feel ever so much better.” At the same time he stretched out his hand toward the horse’s head with the words, “Steady, Strawberry, old boy. Steady now.”

Then for the first time the Witch spoke.

“Dog!” came her cold, clear voice, ringing loud above all the other noises. “Dog, unhand our royal charger. We are the Empress Jadis.”





Chapter 8　THE FIGHT AT THE LAMP-POST


“Ho! Hempress, are you? We’ll see about that,” said a voice. Then another voice said, “Three cheers for the Hempress of Colney ’Atch” and quite a number joined in. A flush of colour came into the Witch’s face and she bowed ever so slightly. But the cheers died away into roars of laughter and she saw that they had only been making fun of her: A change came over her expression and she changed the knife to her left hand. Then, without warning, she did a thing that was dreadful to see. Lightly, easily, as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world, she stretched up her right arm and wrenched off one of the cross-bars of the lamp-post. If she had lost some magical powers in our world, she had not lost her strength; she could break an iron bar as if it were a stick of barley-sugar. She tossed her new weapon up in the air, caught it again, brandished it, and urged the horse forward.

“Now’s my chance,” thought Digory. He darted between the horse and the railings and began going forward. If only the brute would stay still for a moment he might catch the Witch’s heel. As he rushed, he heard a sickening crash and a thud. The Witch had brought the bar down on the chief policeman’s helmet: the man fell like a nine-pin.

“Quick, Digory. This must be stopped,” said a voice beside him. It was Polly, who had rushed down the moment she was allowed out of bed.

“You are a brick,” said Digory. “Hold on to me tight. You’d have to manage the ring. Yellow, remember. And don’t put it on till I shout.”

There was a second crash and another policeman crumpled up. There came an angry roar from the crowd: “Pull her down. Get a few paving-stones. Call out the Military.” But most of them were getting as far away as they could. The Cabby, however, obviously the bravest as well as the kindest person present, was keeping close to the horse, dodging this way and that to avoid the bar, but still trying to catch Strawberry’s head.

The crowd booed and bellowed again. A stone whistled over Digory’s head. Then came the voice of the Witch, clear like a great bell, and sounding as if, for once, she were almost happy.

“Scum! You shall pay dearly for this when I have conquered your world. Not one stone of your city will be left. I will make it as Charn, as Felinda, as Sorlois, as Bramandin.”

Digory at last caught her ankle. She kicked back with her heel and hit him in the mouth. In his pain he lost hold. His lip was cut and his mouth full of blood. From somewhere very close by came the voice of Uncle Andrew in a sort of trembling scream. “Madam—my dear young lady—for heaven’s sake—compose yourself.” Digory made a second grab at her heel, and was again shaken off. More men were knocked down by the iron bar. He made a third grab: caught the heel: held on like grim death, shouting to Polly “Go!” then—Oh, thank goodness. The angry, frightened faces had vanished. The angry, frightened voices were silenced. All except Uncle Andrew’s. Close beside Digory in the darkness, it was wailing on “Oh, oh, is this delirium? Is it the end? I can’t bear it. It’s not fair. I never meant to be a Magician. It’s all a misunderstanding. It’s all my godmother’s fault; I must protest against this. In my state of health too. A very old Dorsetshire family.”

“Bother!” thought Digory. “We didn’t want to bring him along. My hat, what a picnic. Are you there, Polly?”

“Yes, I’m here. Don’t keep on shoving.”

“I’m not,” began Digory, but before he could say anything more, their heads came out into the warm, green sunshine of the wood. And as they stepped out of the pool Polly cried out:

“Oh look! We’ve brought the old horse with us too. And Mr. Ketterley. And the Cabby. This is a pretty kettle of fish!”

As soon as the Witch saw that she was once more in the wood she turned pale and bent down till her face touched the mane of the horse. You could see she felt deadly sick. Uncle Andrew was shivering. But Strawberry, the horse, shook his head, gave a cheerful whinny, and seemed to feel better. He became quiet for the first time since Digory had seen him. His ears, which had been laid flat back on his skull, came into their proper position, and the fire went out of his eyes.

“That’s right, old boy,” said the Cabby, slapping Strawberry’s neck. “That’s better. Take it easy.”

Strawberry did the most natural thing in the world. Being very thirsty (and no wonder) he walked slowly across to the nearest pool and stepped into it to have a drink. Digory was still holding the Witch’s heel and Polly was holding Digory’s hand. One of the Cabby’s hands was on Strawberry; and Uncle Andrew, still very shaky, had just grabbed on the Cabby’s other hand.

“Quick,” said Polly, with a look at Digory. “Greens!”

So the horse never got his drink. Instead, the whole party found themselves sinking into darkness. Strawberry neighed; Uncle Andrew whimpered. Digory said, “That was a bit of luck.”

There was a short pause. Then Polly said, “Oughtn’t we to be nearly there now?”

“We do seem to be somewhere,” said Digory. “At least I’m standing on something solid.”

“Why, so am I, now that I come to think of it,” said Polly. “But why’s it so dark? I say, do you think we got into the wrong Pool?”

“Perhaps this is Charn,” said Digory. “Only we’ve got back in the middle of the night.”

“This is not Charn,” came the Witch’s voice. “This is an empty world. This is Nothing.”

And really it was uncommonly like Nothing. There were no stars. It was so dark that they couldn’t see one another at all and it made no difference whether you kept your eyes shut or open. Under their feet there was a cool, flat something which might have been earth, and was certainly not grass or wood. The air was cold and dry and there was no wind.

“My doom has come upon me,” said the Witch in a voice of horrible calmness.

“Oh don’t say that,” babbled Uncle Andrew. “My dear young lady, pray don’t say such things. It can’t be as bad as that. Ah—Cabman—my good man—you don’t happen to have a flask about you? A drop of spirits is just what I need.”

“Now then, now then,” came the Cabby’s voice, a good firm, hardy voice. “Keep cool everyone, that’s what I say. No bones broken, anyone? Good. Well there’s something to be thankful for straight away, and more than anyone could expect after falling all that way. Now, if we’ve fallen down some diggings—as it might be for a new station on the Underground—someone will come and get us out presently, see! And if we’re dead—which I don’t deny it might be—well, you got to remember that worse things ’appen at sea and a chap’s got to die sometime. And there ain’t nothing to be afraid of if a chap’s led a decent life. And if you ask me, I think the best thing we could do to pass the time would be sing a ’ymn.”

And he did. He struck up at once a harvest thanksgiving hymn, all about crops being “safely gathered in.” It was not very suitable to a place which felt as if nothing had ever grown there since the beginning of time, but it was the one he could remember best. He had a fine voice and the children joined in; it was very cheering. Uncle Andrew and the Witch did not join in.

Toward the end of the hymn Digory felt someone plucking at his elbow and from a general smell of brandy and cigars and good clothes he decided that it must be Uncle Andrew. Uncle Andrew was cautiously pulling him away from the others. When they had gone a little distance, the old man put his mouth so close to Digory’s ear that it tickled, and whispered:

“Now, my boy. Slip on your ring. Let’s be off.”

But the Witch had very good ears. “Fool!” came her voice and she leaped off the horse. “Have you forgotten that I can hear men’s thoughts? Let go the boy. If you attempt treachery I will take such vengeance upon you as never was heard of in all worlds from the beginning.”

“And,” added Digory, “if you think I’m such a mean pig as to go off and leave Polly—and the Cabby—and the horse in a place like this, you’re well mistaken.”

“You are a very naughty and impertinent little boy,” said Uncle Andrew.

“Hush!” said the Cabby. They all listened.

In the darkness something was happening at last. A voice had begun to sing. It was very far away and Digory found it hard to decide from what direction it was coming. Sometimes it seemed to come from all directions at once. Sometimes he almost thought it was coming out of the earth beneath them. Its lower notes were deep enough to be the voice of the earth herself. There were no words. There was hardly even a tune. But it was, beyond comparison, the most beautiful noise he had ever heard. It was so beautiful he could hardly bear it. The horse seemed to like it too; he gave the sort of whinney a horse would give if, after years of being a cab-horse, it found itself back in the old field where it had played as a foal, and saw someone whom it remembered and loved coming across the field to bring it a lump of sugar.

“Gawd!” said the Cabby. “Ain’t it lovely?”

Then two wonders happened at the same moment. One was that the voice was suddenly joined by other voices; more voices than you could possibly count. They were in harmony with it, but far higher up the scale: cold, tingling, silvery voices. The second wonder was that the blackness overhead, all at once, was blazing with stars. They didn’t come out gently one by one, as they do on a summer evening. One moment there had been nothing but darkness; next moment a thousand, thousand points of light leaped out—single stars, constellations, and planets, brighter and bigger than any in our world. There were no clouds. The new stars and the new voices began at exactly the same time. If you had seen and heard it, as Digory did, you would have felt quite certain that it was the stars themselves which were singing, and that it was the First Voice, the deep one, which had made them appear and made them sing.

“Glory be!” said the Cabby. “I’d ha’ been a better man all my life if I’d known there were things like this.”

The Voice on the earth was now louder and more triumphant; but the voices in the sky, after singing loudly with it for a time, began to get fainter. And now something else was happening.

Far away, and down near the horizon, the sky began to turn grey. A light wind, very fresh, began to stir. The sky, in that one place, grew slowly and steadily paler. You could see shapes of hills standing up dark against it. All the time the Voice went on singing.

There was soon light enough for them to see one another’s faces. The Cabby and the two children had open mouths and shining eyes; they were drinking in the sound, and they looked as if it reminded them of something. Uncle Andrew’s mouth was open too, but not open with joy. He looked more as if his chin had simply dropped away from the rest of his face. His shoulders were stopped and his knees shook. He was not liking the Voice. If he could have got away from it by creeping into a rat’s hole, he would have done so. But the Witch looked as if, in a way, she understood the music better than any of them. Her mouth was shut, her lips were pressed together, and her fists were clenched. Ever since the song began she had felt that this whole world was filled with a Magic different from hers and stronger. She hated it. She would have smashed that whole world, or all worlds, to pieces, if it would only stop the singing. The horse stood with its ears well forward, and twitching. Every now and then it snorted and stamped the ground. It no longer looked like a tired old cab-horse; you could now well believe that its father had been in battles.

The eastern sky changed from white to pink and from pink to gold. The Voice rose and rose, till all the air was shaking with it. And just as it swelled to the mightiest and most glorious sound it had yet produced, the sun arose.

Digory had never seen such a sun. The sun above the ruins of Charn had looked older than ours: this looked younger. You could imagine that it laughed for joy as it came up. And as its beams shot across the land the travellers could see for the first time what sort of place they were in. It was a valley through which a broad, swift river wound its way, flowing eastward toward the sun. Southward there were mountains, northward there were lower hills. But it was a valley of mere earth, rock and water; there was not a tree, not a bush, not a blade of grass to be seen. The earth was of many colours: they were fresh, hot and vivid. They made you feel excited; until you saw the Singer himself, and then you forgot everything else.

It was a Lion. Huge, shaggy, and bright, it stood facing the risen sun. Its mouth was wide open in song and it was about three hundred yards away.

“This is a terrible world,” said the Witch. “We must fly at once. Prepare the Magic.”

“I quite agree with you, Madam,” said Uncle Andrew. “A most disagreeable place. Completely uncivilized. If only I were a younger man and had a gun—”

“Garn!” said the Cabby. “You don’t think you could shoot ’im, do you?”

“And who would?” said Polly.

“Prepare the Magic, old fool,” said Jadis.

“Certainly, Madam,” said Uncle Andrew cunningly. “I must have both the children touching me. Put on your homeward ring at once, Digory.” He wanted to get away without the Witch.

“Oh, it’s rings, is it?” cried Jadis. She would have had her hands in Digory’s pocket before you could say knife, but Digory grabbed Polly and shouted out:

“Take care. If either of you come half an inch nearer, we two will vanish and you’ll be left here for good. Yes: I have a ring in my pocket that will take Polly and me home. And look! My hand is just ready. So keep your distance. I’m sorry about you,” (he looked at the Cabby) “and about the horse, but I can’t help that. As for you two,” (he looked at Uncle Andrew and the Queen) “you’re both magicians, so you ought to enjoy living together.”

“’Old your noise, everyone,” said the Cabby. “I want to listen to the moosic.”

For the song had now changed.





Chapter 9　THE FOUNDING OF NARNIA


The Lion was pacing to and fro about that empty land and singing his new song. It was softer and more lilting than the song by which he had called up the stars and the sun; a gentle, rippling music. And as he walked and sang the valley grew green with grass. It spread out from the Lion like a pool. It ran up the sides of the little hills like a wave. In a few minutes it was creeping up the lower slopes of the distant mountains, making that young world every moment softer. The light wind could now be heard ruffling the grass. Soon there were other things besides grass. The higher slopes grew dark with heather. Patches of rougher and more bristling green appeared in the valley. Digory did not know what they were until one began coming up quite close to him. It was a little, spiky thing that threw out dozens of arms and covered these arms with green and grew larger at the rate of about an inch every two seconds. There were dozens of these things all round him now. When they were nearly as tall as himself he saw what they were. “Trees!” he exclaimed.

The nuisance of it, as Polly said afterward, was that you weren’t left in peace to watch it all. Just as Digory said “Trees!” he had to jump because Uncle Andrew had sidled up to him again and was going to pick his pocket. It wouldn’t have done Uncle Andrew much good if he had succeeded, for he was aiming at the right-hand pocket because he still thought the green rings were “homeward” rings. But of course Digory didn’t want to lose either.

“Stop!” cried the Witch. “Stand back. No, further back. If anyone goes within ten paces of either of the children, I will knock out his brains.” She was poising in her hand the iron bar that she had torn off the lamp-post, ready to throw it. Somehow no one doubted that she would be a very good shot.

“So!” she said. “You would steal back to your own world with the boy and leave me here.”

Uncle Andrew’s temper at last got the better of his fears. “Yes, Ma’am, I would,” he said. “Most undoubtedly I would. I should be perfectly in my rights. I have been most shamefully, most abominably treated. I have done my best to show you such civilities as were in my power. And what has been my reward? You have robbed—I must repeat the word—robbed a highly respectable jeweller. You have insisted on my entertaining you to an exceedingly expensive, not to say ostentatious, lunch, though I was obliged to pawn my watch and chain in order to do so (and let me tell you, Ma’am, that none of our family have been in the habit of frequenting pawnshops, except my cousin Edward, and he was in the Yeomanry). During that indigestible meal—I’m feeling the worse for it at this very moment—your behaviour and conversation attracted the unfavourable attention of everyone present. I feel I have been publicly disgraced. I shall never be able to show my face in that restaurant again. You have assaulted the police. You have stolen—”

“Oh stow it, Guv’nor, do stow it,” said the Cabby. “Watchin’ and listenin’s the thing at present; not talking.”

There was certainly plenty to watch and to listen to. The tree which Digory had noticed was now a full-grown beech whose branches swayed gently above his head. They stood on cool, green grass, sprinkled with daisies and buttercups. A little way off, along the river bank, willows were growing. On the other side tangles of flowering currant, lilac, wild rose, and rhododendron closed them in. The horse was tearing up delicious mouthfuls of new grass.

All this time the Lion’s song, and his stately prowl, to and fro, backwards and forward, was going on. What was rather alarming was that at each turn he came a little nearer. Polly was finding the song more and more interesting because she thought she was beginning to see the connection between the music and the things that were happening. When a line of dark firs sprang up on a ridge about a hundred yards away she felt that they were connected with a series of deep, prolonged notes which the Lion had sung a second before. And when he burst into a rapid series of lighter notes she was not surprised to see primroses suddenly appearing in every direction. Thus, with an unspeakable thrill, she felt quite certain that all the things were coming (as she said) “out of the Lion’s head.” When you listened to his song you heard the things he was making up: when you looked round you, you saw them. This was so exciting that she had no time to be afraid. But Digory and the Cabby could not help feeling a bit nervous as each turn of the Lion’s walk brought him nearer. As for Uncle Andrew, his teeth were chattering, but his knees were shaking so that he could not run away.

Suddenly the Witch stepped boldly out toward the Lion. It was coming on, always singing, with a slow, heavy pace. It was only twelve yards away. She raised her arm and flung the iron bar straight at its head.

Nobody, least of all Jadis, could have missed at that range. The bar struck the Lion fair between the eyes. It glanced off and fell with a thud in the grass. The Lion came on. Its walk was neither slower nor faster than before; you could not tell whether it even knew it had been hit. Though its soft pads made no noise, you could feel the earth shake beneath their weight.

The Witch shrieked and ran: in a few moments she was out of sight among the trees. Uncle Andrew turned to do likewise, tripped over a root, and fell flat on his face in a little brook that ran down to join the river. The children could not move. They were not even quite sure that they wanted to. The Lion paid no attention to them. Its huge red mouth was open, but open in song not in a snarl. It passed by them so close that they could have touched its mane. They were terribly afraid it would turn and look at them, yet in some queer way they wished it would. But for all the notice it took of them they might just as well have been invisible and unsmellable. When it had passed them and gone a few paces further it turned, passed them again, and continued its march eastward.

Uncle Andrew, coughing and spluttering, picked himself up.

“Now, Digory,” he said, “we’ve got rid of that woman, and the brute of a lion is gone. Give me your hand and put on your ring at once.”

“Keep off,” said Digory, backing away from him. “Keep clear of him, Polly. Come over here beside me. Now I warn you, Uncle Andrew, don’t come one step nearer, we’ll just vanish.”

“Do what you’re told this minute, sir,” said Uncle Andrew. “You’re an extremely disobedient, ill-behaved little boy.”

“No fear,” said Digory. “We want to stay and see what happens. I thought you wanted to know about other worlds. Don’t you like it now you’re here?”

“Like it!” exclaimed Uncle Andrew. “Just look at the state I’m in. And it was my best coat and waistcoat, too.” He certainly was a dreadful sight by now: for of course, the more dressed up you were to begin with, the worse you look after you’ve crawled out of a smashed hansom cab and fallen into a muddy brook. “I’m not saying,” he added, “that this is not a most interesting place. If I were a younger man, now—perhaps I could get some lively young fellow to come here first. One of those big-game hunters. Something might be made of this country. The climate is delightful. I never felt such air. I believe it would have done me good if—if circumstances had been more favourable. If only we’d had a gun.”

“Guns be blowed,” said the Cabby. “I think I’ll go and see if I can give Strawberry a rub down. That horse ’as more sense than some ’umans as I could mention.” He walked back to Strawberry and began making the hissing noises that grooms make.

“Do you still think that Lion could be killed by a gun?” asked Digory. “He didn’t mind the iron bar much.”

“With all her faults,” said Uncle Andrew, “that’s a plucky gel, my boy. It was a spirited thing to do.” He rubbed his hands and cracked his knuckles, as if he were once more forgetting how the Witch frightened him whenever she was really there.

“It was a wicked thing to do,” said Polly. “What harm had he done her?”

“Hullo! What’s that?” said Digory. He had darted forward to examine something only a few yards away. “I say, Polly,” he called back. “Do come and look.”

Uncle Andrew came with her; not because he wanted to see but because he wanted to keep close to the children—there might be a chance of stealing their rings. But when he saw what Digory was looking at, even he began to take an interest. It was a perfect little model of a lamp-post, about three feet high but lengthening, and thickening in proportion, as they watched it; in fact growing just as the trees had grown.

“It’s alive too—I mean, it’s lit,” said Digory. And so it was; though of course, the brightness of the sun made the little flame in the lantern hard to see unless your shadow fell on it.

“Remarkable, most remarkable,” muttered Uncle Andrew. “Even I never dreamt of Magic like this. We’re in a world where everything, even a lamp-post, comes to life and grows. Now I wonder what sort of seed a lamp-post grows from?”

“Don’t you see?” said Digory. “This is where the bar fell—the bar she tore off the lamp-post at home. It sank into the ground and now it’s coming up as a young lamp-post.” (But not so very young now; it was as tall as Digory while he said this.)

“That’s it! Stupendous, stupendous,” said Uncle Andrew, rubbing his hands harder than ever. “Ho, ho! They laughed at my Magic. That fool of a sister of mine thinks I’m a lunatic. I wonder what they’ll say now? I have discovered a world where everything is bursting with life and growth. Columbus, now, they talk about Columbus. But what was America to this? The commercial possibilities of this country are unbounded. Bring a few old bits of scrap iron here, bury ’em, and up they come as brand new railway engines, battleships, anything you please. They’ll cost nothing, and I can sell ’em at full prices in England. I shall be a millionaire. And then the climate! I feel years younger already. I can run it as a health resort. A good sanatorium here might be worth twenty thousand a year. Of course I shall have to let a few people into the secret. The first thing is to get that brute shot.”

“You’re just like the Witch,” said Polly. “All you think of is killing things.”

“And then as regards oneself,” Uncle Andrew continued, in a happy dream. “There’s no knowing how long I might live if I settled here. And that’s a big consideration when a fellow has turned sixty. I shouldn’t be surprised if I never grew a day older in this country! Stupendous! The land of youth!”

“Oh!” cried Digory. “The land of youth! Do you think it really is?” For of course he remembered what Aunt Letty had said to the lady who brought the grapes, and that sweet hope rushed back upon him. “Uncle Andrew,” he said, “do you think there’s anything here that would cure Mother?”

“What are you talking about?” said Uncle Andrew. “This isn’t a chemist’s shop. But as I was saying—”

“You don’t care twopence about her,” said Digory savagely. “I thought you might; after all, she’s your sister as well as my Mother. Well, no matter. I’m jolly well going to ask the Lion himself if he can help me.” And he turned and walked briskly away. Polly waited for a moment and then went after him.

“Here! Stop! Come back! The boy’s gone mad,” said Uncle Andrew. He followed the children at a cautious distance behind; for he didn’t want to get too far away from the green rings or too near the Lion.

In a few minutes Digory came to the edge of the wood and there he stopped. The Lion was singing still. But now the song had once more changed. It was more like what we should call a tune, but it was also far wilder. It made you want to run and jump and climb. It made you want to shout. It made you want to rush at other people and either hug them or fight them. It made Digory hot and red in the face. It had some effect on Uncle Andrew, for Digory could hear him saying, “A spirited gel, sir. It’s a pity about her temper, but a dem fine woman all the same, a dem fine woman.” But what the song did to the two humans was nothing compared with what it was doing to the country.

Can you imagine a stretch of grassy land bubbling like water in a pot? For that is really the best description of what was happening. In all directions it was swelling into humps. They were of very different sizes, some no bigger than mole-hills, some as big as wheel-barrows, two the size of cottages. And the humps moved and swelled till they burst, and the crumbled earth poured out of them, and from each hump there came out an animal. The moles came out just as you might see a mole come out in England. The dogs came out, barking the moment their heads were free, and struggling as you’ve seen them do when they are getting through a narrow hole in a hedge. The stags were the queerest to watch, for of course the antlers came up a long time before the rest of them, so at first Digory thought they were trees. The frogs, who all came up near the river, went straight into it with a plop-plop and a loud croaking. The panthers, leopards and things of that sort, sat down at once to wash the loose earth off their hind quarters and then stood up against the trees to sharpen their front claws. Showers of birds came out of the trees. Butterflies fluttered. Bees got to work on the flowers as if they hadn’t a second to lose. But the greatest moment of all was when the biggest hump broke like a small earthquake and out came the sloping back, the large, wise head, and the four baggy-trousered legs of an elephant. And now you could hardly hear the song of the Lion; there was so much cawing, cooing, crowing, braying, neighing, baying, barking, lowing, bleating, and trumpeting.

But though Digory could no longer hear the Lion, he could see it. It was so big and so bright that he could not take his eyes off it. The other animals did not appear to be afraid of it. Indeed, at that very moment, Digory heard the sound of hoofs from behind; a second later the old cab-horse trotted past him and joined the other beasts. (The air had apparently suited him as well as it had suited Uncle Andrew. He no longer looked like the poor, old slave he had been in London; he was picking up his feet and holding his head erect.) And now, for the first time, the Lion was quite silent. He was going to and fro among the animals. And every now and then he would go up to two of them (always two at a time) and touch their noses with his. He would touch two beavers among all the beavers, two leopards among all the leopards, one stag and one deer among all the deer, and leave the rest. Some sorts of animal he passed over altogether. But the pairs which he had touched instantly left their own kinds and followed him. At last he stood still and all the creatures whom he had touched came and stood in a wide circle around him. The others whom he had not touched began to wander away. Their noises faded gradually into the distance. The chosen beasts who remained were now utterly silent, all with their eyes fixed intently upon the Lion. The cat-like ones gave an occasional twitch of the tail but otherwise all were still. For the first time that day there was complete silence, except for the noise of running water. Digory’s heart beat wildly; he knew something very solemn was going to be done. He had not forgotten about his Mother; but he knew jolly well that, even for her, he couldn’t interrupt a thing like this.

The Lion, whose eyes never blinked, stared at the animals as hard as if he was going to burn them up with his mere stare. And gradually a change came over them. The smaller ones—the rabbits, moles and such-like—grew a good deal larger. The very big ones—you noticed it most with the elephants—grew a little smaller. Many animals sat up on their hind legs. Most put their heads on one side as if they were trying very hard to understand. The Lion opened his mouth, but no sound came from it; he was breathing out, a long, warm breath; it seemed to sway all the beasts as the wind sways a line of trees. Far overhead from beyond the veil of blue sky which hid them the stars sang again; a pure, cold, difficult music. Then there came a swift flash like fire (but it burnt nobody) either from the sky or from the Lion itself, and every drop of blood tingled in the children’s bodies, and the deepest, wildest voice they had ever heard was saying:

“Narnia, Narnia, Narnia, awake. Love. Think. Speak. Be walking trees. Be talking beasts. Be divine waters.”





Chapter 10　THE FIRST JOKE AND OTHER MATTERS


It was of course the Lion’s voice. The children had long felt sure that he could speak: yet it was a lovely and terrible shock when he did.

Out of the trees wild people stepped forth, gods and goddesses of the wood; with them came Fauns and Satyrs and Dwarfs. Out of the river rose the river god with his Naiad daughters. And all these and all the beasts and birds in their different voices, low or high or thick or clear, replied:

“Hail, Aslan. We hear and obey. We are awake. We love. We think. We speak. We know.”

“But please, we don’t know very much yet,” said a nosey and snorty kind of voice. And that really did make the children jump, for it was the cab-horse who had spoken.

“Good old Strawberry,” said Polly. “I am glad he was one of the ones picked out to be a Talking Beast.” And the Cabby, who was now standing beside the children, said, “Strike me pink. I always did say that ’oss ’ad a lot of sense, though.”

“Creatures, I give you yourselves,” said the strong, happy voice of Aslan. “I give to you forever this land of Narnia. I give you the woods, the fruits, the rivers. I give you the stars and I give you myself. The Dumb Beasts whom I have not chosen are yours also. Treat them gently and cherish them but do not go back to their ways lest you cease to be Talking Beasts. For out of them you were taken and into them you can return. Do not so.”

“No, Aslan, we won’t, we won’t,” said everyone. But one perky jackdaw added in a loud voice, “No fear!” and everyone else had finished just before he said it so that his words came out quite clear in a dead silence; and perhaps you have found out how awful that can be—say, at a party. The Jackdaw became so embarrassed that it hid its head under its wings as if it was going to sleep. And all the other animals began making various queer noises which are their ways of laughing and which, of course, no one has ever heard in our world. They tried at first to repress it, but Aslan said:

“Laugh and fear not, creatures. Now that you are no longer dumb and witless, you need not always be grave. For jokes as well as justice come in with speech.”

So they all let themselves go. And there was such merriment that the Jackdaw himself plucked up courage again and perched on the cab-horse’s head, between its ears, clapping its wings, and said:

“Aslan! Aslan! Have I made the first joke? Will everybody always be told how I made the first joke?”

“No, little friend,” said the Lion. “You have not made the first joke; you have only been the first joke.” Then everyone laughed more than ever; but the Jackdaw didn’t mind and laughed just as loud till the horse shook its head and the Jackdaw lost its balance and fell off, but remembered its wings (they were still new to it) before it reached the ground.

“And now,” said Aslan, “Narnia is established. We must next take thought for keeping it safe. I will call some of you to my council. Come hither to me, you the chief Dwarf, and you the River-god, and you Oak and the He-Owl, and both the Ravens and the Bull-Elephant. We must talk together. For though the world is not five hours old an evil has already entered it.”

The creatures he had named came forward and he turned away eastward with them. The others all began talking, saying things like “What did he say had entered the world?—A Neevil—What’s a Neevil?—No, he didn’t say a Neevil, he said a weevil—Well, what’s that?”

“Look here,” said Digory to Polly, “I’ve got to go after him—Aslan, I mean, the Lion. I must speak to him.”

“Do you think we can?” said Polly. “I wouldn’t dare.”

“I’ve got to,” said Digory. “It’s about Mother. If anyone could give me something that would do her good, it would be him.”

“I’ll come along with you,” said the Cabby. “I liked the looks of ’im. And I don’t reckon these other beasts will go for us. And I want a word with old Strawberry.”

So all three of them stepped out boldly—or as boldly as they could—toward the assembly of animals. The creatures were so busy talking to one another and making friends that they didn’t notice the three humans until they were very close; nor did they hear Uncle Andrew, who was standing trembling in his buttoned boots a good way off and shouting (but by no means at the top of his voice).

“Digory! Come back! Come back at once when you’re told. I forbid you to go a step further.”

When at last they were right in among the animals, the animals all stopped talking and stared at them.

“Well?” said the He-Beaver at last, “what, in the name of Aslan, are these?”

“Please,” began Digory in rather a breathless voice, when a Rabbit said. “They’re a kind of large lettuce, that’s my belief.”

“No, we’re not, honestly we’re not,” said Polly hastily. “We’re not at all nice to eat.”

“There!” said the Mole. “They can talk. Who ever heard of a talking lettuce?”

“Perhaps they’re the Second joke,” suggested the Jackdaw.

A Panther, which had been washing its face, stopped for a moment to say, “Well, if they are, they’re nothing like so good as the first one. At least, 1 don’t see anything very funny about them.” It yawned and went on with its wash.

“Oh, please,” said Digory. “I’m in such a hurry. I want to see the Lion.”

All this time the Cabby had been trying to catch Strawberry’s eye. Now he did. “Now, Strawberry, old boy,” he said. “You know me. You ain’t going to stand there and say as you don’t know me.”

“What’s the Thing talking about, Horse?” said several voices.

“Well,” said Strawberry very slowly, “I don’t exactly know, I think most of us don’t know much about any thing yet. But I’ve a sort of idea I’ve seen a thing like this before. I’ve a feeling I lived somewhere else—or was something else—before Aslan woke us all up a few minutes ago. It’s all very muddled. Like a dream. But there were things like these three in the dream.”

“What?” said the Cabby. “Not know me? Me what used to bring you a hot mash of an evening when you was out of sorts? Me what rubbed you down proper? Me what never forgot to put your cloth on you if you was standing in the—cold? I wouldn’t ’ave thought it of you, Strawberry.”

“It does begin to come back,” said the Horse thoughtfully. “Yes. Let me think now, let me think. Yes, you used to tie a horrid black thing behind me and then hit me to make me run, and however far I ran this black thing would always be coming rattle-rattle behind me.”

“We ’ad our living to earn, see,” said the Cabby. “Yours the same as mine. And if there ’adn’t been no work and no whip there’d ’ave been no stable, no hay, no mash, and no oats. For you did get a taste of oats when I could afford ’em, which no one can deny.”

“Oats?” said the Horse, pricking up his ears. “Yes, I remember something about that. Yes, I remember more and more. You were always sitting up somewhere behind, and I was always running in front, pulling you and the black thing. I know I did all the work.”

“Summer, I grant you,” said the Cabby. “’Ot work for you and a cool seat for me. But what about winter, old boy, when you was keeping yourself warm and I was sitting up there with my feet like ice and my nose fair pinched off me with the wind, and my ’ands that numb I couldn’t ’ardly ’old the reins?”

“It was a hard, cruel country,” said Strawberry. “There was no grass. All hard stones.”

“Too true, mate, too true!” said the Cabby. “A ’ard world it was. I always did say those paving-stones weren’t fair on any ’oss. That’s Lunn’on, that is. I didn’t like it no more than what you did. You were a country ’oss, and I was a country man. Used to sing in the choir, I did, down at ’ome. But there wasn’t a living for me there.”

“Oh please, please,” said Digory. “Could we get on? The Lion’s getting further and further away. And I do want to speak to him so dreadfully badly.”

“Look ’ere, Strawberry,” said the Cabby. “This young gen’leman ’as something on his mind that he wants to talk to the Lion about; ’im you call Aslan. Suppose you was to let ’im ride on your back (which ’e’d take it very kindly) and trot ’im over to where the Lion is. And me and the little girl will be following along.”

“Ride?” said Strawberry. “Oh, I remember now. That means sitting on my back. I remember there used to be a little one of you two-leggers who used to do that long ago. He used to have little hard, square lumps of some white stuff that he gave me. They tasted—oh, wonderful, sweeter than grass.”

“Ah, that’d be sugar,” said the Cabby.

“Please, Strawberry,” begged Digory, “do, do let me get up and take me to Aslan.”

“Well, I don’t mind,” said the Horse. “Not for once in a way. Up you get.”

“Good old Strawberry,” said the Cabby. “’Ere, young ’un, I’ll give you a lift.” Digory was soon on Strawberry’s back, and quite comfortable, for he had ridden bare-back before on his own pony.

“Now, do gee up, Strawberry,” he said.

“You don’t happen to have a bit of that white stuff about you, I suppose?” said the Horse.

“No. I’m afraid I haven’t,” said Digory.

“Well, it can’t be helped,” said Strawberry, and off they went.

At that moment a large Bulldog, who had been sniffing and staring very hard, said:

“Look. Isn’t there another of these queer creatures—over there, beside the river, under the trees?”

Then all the animals looked and saw Uncle Andrew, standing very still among the rhododendrons and hoping he wouldn’t be noticed.

“Come on!” said several voices. “Let’s go and find out.” So, while Strawberry was briskly trotting away with Digory in one direction (and Polly and the Cabby were following on foot) most of the creatures rushed toward Uncle Andrew with roars, barks, grunts, and various noises of cheerful interest.

We must now go back a bit and explain what the whole scene had looked like from Uncle Andrew’s point of view. It had not made at all the same impression on him as on the Cabby and the children. For what you see and hear depends a good deal on where you are standing: it also depends on what sort of person you are.

Ever since the animals had first appeared, Uncle Andrew had been shrinking further and further back into the thicket. He watched them very hard of course; but he wasn’t really interested in seeing what they were doing, only in seeing whether they were going to make a rush at him. Like the Witch, he was dreadfully practical. He simply didn’t notice that Aslan was choosing one pair out of every kind of beasts. All he saw, or thought he saw, was a lot of dangerous wild animals walking vaguely about. And he kept on wondering why the other animals didn’t run away from the big Lion.

When the great moment came and the Beasts spoke, he missed the whole point; for a rather interesting reason. When the Lion had first begun singing, long ago when it was still quite dark, he had realized that the noise was a song. And he had disliked the song very much. It made him think and feel things he did not want to think and feel. Then, when the sun rose and he saw that the singer was a lion (“only a lion,” as he said to himself) he tried his hardest to make believe that it wasn’t singing and never had been singing—only roaring as any lion might in a zoo in our own world. “Of course it can’t really have been singing,” he thought, “I must have imagined it. I’ve been letting my nerves get out of order. Who ever heard of a lion singing?” And the longer and more beautiful the Lion sang, the harder Uncle Andrew tried to make himself believe that he could hear nothing but roaring. Now the trouble about trying to make yourself stupider than you really are is that you very often succeed. Uncle Andrew did. He soon did hear nothing but roaring in Aslan’s song. Soon he couldn’t have heard anything else even if he had wanted to. And when at last the Lion spoke and said, “Narnia awake,” he didn’t hear any words: he heard only a snarl. And when the Beasts spoke in answer, he heard only barkings, growlings, bayings, and howlings. And when they laughed—well, you can imagine. That was worse for Uncle Andrew than anything that had happened yet. Such a horrid, bloodthirsty din of hungry and angry brutes he had never heard in his life. Then, to his utter rage and horror, he saw the other three humans actually walking out into the open to meet the animals.

“The fools!” he said to himself. “Now those brutes will eat the rings along with the children and I’ll never be able to get home again. What a selfish little boy that Digory is! And the others are just as bad. If they want to throw away their own lives, that’s their business. But what about me? They don’t seem to think of that. No one thinks of me.”

Finally, when a whole crowd of animals came rushing toward him, he turned and ran for his life. And now anyone could see that the air of that young world was really doing the old gentleman good. In London he had been far too old to run: now, he ran at a speed which would have made him certain to win the hundred yards’ race at any Prep school in England. His coat-tails flying out behind him were a fine sight. But of course it was no use. Many of the animals behind him were swift ones; it was the first run they had ever taken in their lives and they were all longing to use their new muscles. “After him! After him!” they shouted. “Perhaps he’s that Neevil! Tally-ho! Tantivy! Cut him off! Round him up! Keep it up! Hurrah!”

In a very few minutes some of them got ahead of him. They lined up in a row and barred his way. Others hemmed him in from behind. Wherever he looked he saw terrors. Antlers of great elks and the huge face of an elephant towered over him. Heavy, serious-minded bears and boars grunted behind him. Cool-looking leopards and panthers with sarcastic faces (as he thought) stared at him and waved their tails. What struck him most of all was the number of open mouths. The animals had really opened their mouths to pant; he thought they had opened their mouths to eat him.

Uncle Andrew stood trembling and swaying this way and that. He had never liked animals at the best of times, being usually rather afraid of them; and of course years of doing cruel experiments on animals had made him hate and fear them far more.

“Now, sir,” said the Bulldog in his business-like way, “are you animal, vegetable, or mineral?” That was what it really said; but all Uncle Andrew heard was “Gr-r-rarrh-ow!”





Chapter 11　DIGORY AND HIS UNCLE ARE BOTH IN TROUBLE


You may think the animals were very stupid not to see at once that Uncle Andrew was the same kind of creature as the two children and the Cabby. But you must remember that the animals knew nothing about clothes. They thought that Polly’s frock and Digory’s Norfolk suit and the Cabby’s bowler hat were as much parts of them as their own fur and feathers. They wouldn’t have known even that those three were all of the same kind if they hadn’t spoken to them and if Strawberry had not seemed to think so. And Uncle Andrew was a great deal taller than the children and a good deal thinner than the Cabby. He was all in black except for his white waistcoat (not very white by now), and the great gray mop of his hair (now very wild indeed) didn’t look to them like anything they had seen in the three other humans. So it was only natural that they should be puzzled. Worst of all, he didn’t seem to be able to talk.

He had tried to. When the Bulldog spoke to him (or, as he thought, first snarled and then growled at him) he held out his shaking hand and gasped “Good Doggie, then, poor old fellow.” But the beasts could not understand him any more than he could understand them. They didn’t hear any words: only a vague sizzling noise. Perhaps it was just as well they didn’t, for no dog that I ever knew, least of all a Talking Dog of Narnia, likes being called a Good Doggie then; any more than you would like being called My Little Man.

Then Uncle Andrew dropped down in a dead faint.

“There!” said a Warthog, “it’s only a tree. I always thought so.” (Remember, they had never yet seen a faint or even a fall.)

The Bulldog, who had been sniffing Uncle Andrew all over, raised its head and said, “It’s an animal. Certainly an animal. And probably the same kind as those other ones.”

“I don’t see that,” said one of the Bears. “An animal wouldn’t just roll over like that. We’re animals and we don’t roll over. We stand up. Like this.” He rose to his hind legs, took a step backwards, tripped over a low branch and fell flat on his back.

“The Third Joke, the Third Joke, the Third joke!” said the Jackdaw in great excitement.

“I still think it’s a sort of tree,” said the Warthog.

“If it’s a tree,” said the other Bear, “there might be a bees’ nest in it.”

“I’m sure it’s not a tree,” said the Badger. “I had a sort of idea it was trying to speak before it toppled over.”

“That was only the wind in its branches,” said the Warthog.

“You surely don’t mean,” said the Jackdaw to the Badger, “that you think its a talking animal! It didn’t say any words.”

“And yet, you know,” said the Elephant (the She-Elephant, of course; her husband, as you remember, had been called away by Aslan). “And yet, you know, it might be an animal of some kind. Mightn’t the whitish lump at this end be a sort of face? And couldn’t those holes be eyes and a mouth? No nose, of course. But then—ahem—one mustn’t be narrow-minded. Very few of us have what could exactly be called a Nose.” She squinted down the length of her own trunk with pardonable pride.

“I object to that remark very strongly,” said the Bulldog.

“The Elephant is quite right,” said the Tapir.

“I tell you what!” said the Donkey brightly, “perhaps it’s an animal that can’t talk but thinks it can.”

“Can it be made to stand up?” said the Elephant thoughtfully. She took the limp form of Uncle Andrew gently in her trunk and set him up on end: upside down, unfortunately, so that two half-sovereigns, three half-crowns, and a sixpence fell out of his pocket. But it was no use. Uncle Andrew merely collapsed again.

“There!” said several voices. “It isn’t an animal at all. It’s not alive.”

“I tell you, it is an animal,” said the Bulldog. “Smell it for yourself.”

“Smelling isn’t everything,” said the Elephant.

“Why,” said the Bulldog, “if a fellow can’t trust his nose, what is he to trust?”

“Well, his brains perhaps,” she replied mildly.

“I object to that remark very strongly,” said the Bulldog.

“Well, we must do something about it,” said the Elephant. “Because it may be the Neevil, and it must be shown to Aslan. What do most of us think? Is it an animal or something of the tree kind?”

“Tree! Tree!” said a dozen voices.

“Very well,” said the Elephant. “Then, if it’s a tree it wants to be planted. We must dig a hole.”

The two Moles settled that part of the business pretty quickly. There was some dispute as to which way up Uncle Andrew ought to be put into the hole, and he had a very narrow escape from being put in head foremost. Several animals said his legs must be his branches and therefore the grey, fluffy thing (they meant his head) must be his root. But then others said that the forked end of him was the muddier and that it spread out more, as roots ought to do. So finally he was planted right way up. When they had patted down the earth it came up above his knees.

“It looks dreadfully withered,” said the Donkey.

“Of course it wants some watering,” said the Elephant. “I think I might say (meaning no offence to anyone present) that, perhaps, for that sort of work, my kind of nose—”

“I object to that remark very strongly,” said the Bulldog. But the Elephant walked quietly to the river, filled her trunk with water, and came back to attend to Uncle Andrew. The sagacious animal went on doing this till gallons of water had been squirted over him, and water was running out of the skirts of his frock-coat as if he had been for a bath with all his clothes on. In the end it revived him. He awoke from his faint. What a wakening it was! But we must leave him to think over his wicked deed (if he was likely to do anything so sensible) and turn to more important things.

Strawberry trotted on with Digory on his back till the noise of the other animals died away, and now the little group of Aslan and his chosen councillors was quite close. Digory knew that he couldn’t possibly break in on so solemn a meeting, but there was no need to do so. At a word from Aslan, the He-Elephant, the Ravens, and all the rest of them drew aside. Digory slipped off the horse and found himself face to face with Aslan. And Aslan was bigger and more beautiful and more brightly golden and more terrible than he had thought. He dared not look into the great eyes.

“Please—Mr. Lion—Aslan—Sir,” said Digory, “could you—may I—please, will you give me some magic fruit of this country to make Mother well?”

He had been desperately hoping that the Lion would say “Yes;” he had been horribly afraid it might say “No.” But he was taken aback when it did neither.

“This is the Boy,” said Aslan, looking, not at Digory, but at his councillors. “This is the Boy who did it.”

“Oh dear,” thought Digory, “what have I done now?”

“Son of Adam,” said the Lion. “There is an evil Witch abroad in my new land of Narnia. Tell these good Beasts how she came here.”

A dozen different things that he might say flashed through Digory’s mind, but he had the sense to say nothing except the exact truth.

“I brought her, Aslan,” he answered in a low voice.

“For what purpose?”

“I wanted to get her out of my own world back into her own. I thought I was taking her back to her own place.”

“How came she to be in your world, Son of Adam?”

“By—by Magic.”

The Lion said nothing and Digory knew that he had not told enough.

“It was my Uncle, Aslan,” he said. “He sent us out of our own world by magic rings, at least I had to go because he sent Polly first, and then we met the Witch in a place called Charn and she just held on to us when—”

“You met the Witch?” said Asian in a low voice which had the threat of a growl in it.

“She woke up,” said Digory wretchedly. And then, turning very white, “I mean, I woke her. Because I wanted to know what would happen if I struck a bell. Polly didn’t want to. It wasn’t her fault. I—I fought her. I know I shouldn’t have. I think I was a bit enchanted by the writing under the bell.”

“Do you?” asked Asian; still speaking very low and deep.

“No,” said Digory. “I see now I wasn’t. I was only pretending.”

There was a long pause. And Digory was thinking all the time, “I’ve spoiled everything. There’s no chance of getting anything for Mother now.”

When the Lion spoke again, it was not to Digory.

“You see, friends,” he said, “that before the new, clean world I gave you is seven hours old, a force of evil has already entered it; waked and brought hither by this son of Adam.” The Beasts, even Strawberry, all turned their eyes on Digory till he felt that he wished the ground would swallow him up. “But do not be cast down,” said Aslan, still speaking to the Beasts. “Evil will come of that evil, but it is still a long way off, and I will see to it that the worst falls upon myself. In the meantime, let us take such order that for many hundred years yet this shall be a merry land in a merry world. And as Adam’s race has done the harm, Adam’s race shall help to heal it. Draw near, you other two.”

The last words were spoken to Polly and the Cabby who had now arrived. Polly, all eyes and mouth, was staring at Aslan and holding the Cabby’s hand rather tightly. The Cabby gave one glance at the Lion, and took off his bowler hat: no one had yet seen him without it. When it was off, he looked younger and nicer, and more like a countryman and less like a London cabman.

“Son,” said Aslan to the Cabby. “I have known you long. Do you know me?”

“Well, no, sir,” said the Cabby. “Leastways, not in an ordinary manner of speaking. Yet I feel somehow, if I may make so free, as ’ow we’ve met before.”

“It is well,” said the Lion. “You know better than you think you know, and you shall live to know me better yet. How does this land please you?”

“It’s a fair treat, sir,” said the Cabby.

“Would you like to live here always?”

“Well you see sir, I’m a married man,” said the Cabby. “If my wife was here neither of us would ever want to go back to London, I reckon. We’re both country folks, really.”

Aslan threw up his shaggy head, opened his mouth, and uttered a long, single note; not very loud, but full of power. Polly’s heart jumped in her body when she heard it. She felt sure that it was a call, and that anyone who heard that call would want to obey it and (what’s more) would be able to obey it, however many worlds and ages lay between. And so, though she was filled with wonder, she was not really astonished or shocked when all of a sudden a young woman, with a kind, honest face stepped out of nowhere and stood beside her. Polly knew at once that it was the Cabby’s wife, fetched out of our world not by any tiresome magic rings, but quickly, simply and sweetly as a bird flies to its nest. The young woman had apparently been in the middle of a washing day, for she wore an apron, her sleeves were rolled up to the elbow, and there were soapsuds on her hands. If she had had time to put on her good clothes (her best hat had imitation cherries on it) she would have looked dreadful; as it was, she looked rather nice.

Of course she thought she was dreaming. That was why she didn’t rush across to her husband and ask him what on earth had happened to them both. But when she looked at the Lion she didn’t feel quite so sure it was a dream, yet for some reason she did not appear to be very frightened. Then she dropped a little half curtsey, as some country girls still knew how to do in those days. After that, she went and put her hand in the Cabby’s and stood there looking round her a little shyly.

“My children,” said Aslan, fixing his eyes on both of them, “you are to be the first King and Queen of Narnia.”

The Cabby opened his mouth in astonishment, and his wife turned very red.

“You shall rule and name all these creatures, and do justice among them, and protect them from their enemies when enemies arise. And enemies will arise, for there is an evil Witch in this world.”

The Cabby swallowed hard two or three times and cleared his throat.

“Begging your pardon, sir,” he said, “and thanking you very much I’m sure (which my Missus does the same) but I ain’t no sort of a chap for a job like that. I never ’ad much eddycation, you see.”

“Well,” said Aslan, “can you use a spade and a plow and raise food out of the earth?”

“Yes, sir, I could do a bit of that sort of work: being brought up to it, like.”

“Can you rule these creatures kindly and fairly, remembering that they are not slaves like the dumb beasts of the world you were born in, but Talking Beasts and free subjects?”

“I see that, sir,” replied the Cabby. “I’d try to do the square thing by them all.”

“And would you bring up your children and grandchildren to do the same?”

“It’d be up to me to try, sir. I’d do my best: wouldn’t we, Nellie?”

“And you wouldn’t have favourites either among your own children or among the other creatures or let any hold another under or use it hardly?”

“I never could abide such goings on, sir, and that’s the truth. I’d give ’em what for if I caught ’em at it,” said the Cabby. (All through this conversation his voice was growing slower and richer. More like the country voice he must have had as a boy and less like the sharp, quick voice of a cockney.)

“And if enemies came against the land (for enemies will arise) and there was war, would you be the first in the charge and the last in the retreat?”

“Well, sir,” said the Cabby very slowly, “a chap don’t exactly know till he’s been tried. I dare say I might turn out ever such a soft ’un. Never did no fighting except with my fists. I’d try—that is, I ’ope I’d try—to do my bit.”

“Then,” said Aslan. “You will have done all that a King should do. Your coronation will be held presently. And you and your children and grandchildren shall be blessed, and some will be Kings of Narnia, and others will be Kings of Archenland which lies yonder over the Southern Mountains. And you, little Daughter,” (here he turned to Polly) “are welcome. Have you forgiven the Boy for the violence he did you in the Hall of Images in the desolate palace of accursed Charn?”

“Yes, Aslan, we’ve made it up,” said Polly.

“That is well,” said Aslan. “And now for the Boy himself.”





Chapter 12　STRAWBERRY’S ADVENTURE


Digory kept his mouth very tight shut. He had been growing more and more uncomfortable. He hoped that, whatever happened, he wouldn’t blub or do anything ridiculous.

“Son of Adam,” said Aslan. “Are you ready to undo the wrong that you have done to my sweet country of Narnia on the very day of its birth?”

“Well, I don’t see what I can do,” said Digory. “You see, the Queen ran away and—”

“I asked, are you ready?” said the Lion.

“Yes,” said Digory. He had had for a second some wild idea of saying “I’ll try to help you if you’ll promise to help my Mother,” but he realized in time that the Lion was not at all the sort of person one could try to make bargains with. But when he had said “Yes,” he thought of his Mother, and he thought of the great hopes he had had, and how they were all dying away, and a lump came in his throat and tears in his eyes, and he blurted out:

“But please, please—won’t you—can’t you give me something that will cure Mother?” Up till then he had been looking at the Lion’s great feet and the huge claws on them; now, in his despair, he looked up at its face. What he saw surprised him as much as anything in his whole life. For the tawny face was bent down near his own and (wonder of wonders) great shining tears stood in the Lion’s eyes. They were such big, bright tears compared with Digory’s own that for a moment he felt as if the Lion must really be sorrier about his Mother than he was himself.

“My son, my son,” said Aslan. “I know. Grief is great. Only you and I in this land know that yet. Let us be good to one another. But I have to think of hundreds of years in the life of Narnia. The Witch whom you have brought into this world will come back to Narnia again. But it need not be yet. It is my wish to plant in Narnia a tree that she will not dare to approach, and that tree will protect Narnia from her for many years. So this land shall have a long, bright morning before any clouds come over the sun. You must get me the seed from which that tree is to grow.”

“Yes, sir,” said Digory. He didn’t know how it was to be done but he felt quite sure now that he would be able to do it. The Lion drew a deep breath, stooped its head even lower and gave him a Lion’s kiss. And at once Digory felt that new strength and courage had gone into him.

“Dear son,” said Aslan, “I will tell you what you must do. Turn and look to the West and tell me what do you see?”

“I see terribly big mountains, Aslan,” said Digory, “I see this river coming down cliffs in a waterfall. And beyond the cliff there are high green hills with forests. And beyond those there are higher ranges that look almost black. And then, far away, there are big snowy mountains all heaped up together—like pictures of the Alps. And behind those there’s nothing but the sky.”

“You see well,” said the Lion. “Now the land of Narnia ends where the waterfall comes down, and once you have reached the top of the cliffs you will be out of Narnia and into the Western Wild. You must journey through those mountains till you find a green valley with a blue lake in it, walled round by mountains of ice. At the end of the lake there is a steep, green hill. On the top of that hill there is a garden. In the centre of that garden is a tree. Pluck an apple from that tree and bring it back to me.”

“Yes, sir,” said Digory again. He hadn’t the least idea of how he was to climb the cliff and find his way among all the mountains, but he didn’t like to say that for fear it would sound like making excuses. But he did say, “I hope, Aslan, you’re not in a hurry. I shan’t be able to get there and back very quickly.”

“Little son of Adam, you shall have help,” said Aslan. He then turned to the Horse who had been standing quietly beside them all this time, swishing his tail to keep the flies off, and listening with his head on one side as if the conversation were a little difficult to understand.

“My dear,” said Aslan to the Horse, “would you like to be a winged horse?”

You should have seen how the Horse shook its mane and how its nostrils widened, and the little tap it gave the ground with one back hoof. Clearly it would very much like to be a winged horse. But it only said:

“If you wish, Aslan—if you really mean—I don’t know why it should be me—I’m not a very clever horse.”

“Be winged. Be the father of all flying horses,” roared Aslan in a voice that shook the ground. “Your name is Fledge.”

The horse shied, just as it might have shied in the old, miserable days when it pulled a hansom. Then it roared. It strained its neck back as if there were a fly biting its shoulders and it wanted to scratch them. And then, just as the beasts had burst out of the earth, there burst out from the shoulders of Fledge wings that spread and grew, larger than eagles’, larger than swans’, larger than angels’ wings in church windows. The feathers shone chestnut colour and copper colour. He gave a great sweep with them and leaped into the air. Twenty feet above Aslan and Digory he snorted, neighed, and curvetted. Then, after circling once round them, he dropped to the earth, all four hoofs together, looking awkward and surprised, but extremely pleased.

“Is it good, Fledge?” said Aslan.

“It is very good, Aslan,” said Fledge.

“Will you carry this little son of Adam on your back to the mountain-valley I spoke of?”

“What? Now? At once?” said Strawberry—or Fledge, as we must now call him—“Hurrah! Come on little one, I’ve had things like you on my back before. Long, long ago. When there were green fields; and sugar.”

“What are the two daughters of Eve whispering about?” said Aslan, turning very suddenly on Polly and the Cabby’s wife, who had in fact been making friends.

“If you please, sir,” said Queen Helen (for that is what Nellie the cabman’s wife now was), “I think the little girl would love to go too, if it weren’t no trouble.”

“What does Fledge say about that?” asked the Lion.

“Oh, I don’t mind two, not when they’re little ones,” said Fledge. “But I hope the Elephant doesn’t want to come as well.”

The Elephant had no such wish, and the new King of Narnia helped both the children up: that is, he gave Digory a rough heave and set Polly as gently and daintily on the horse’s back as if she were made of china and might break. “There they are, Strawberry—Fledge, I should say. This is a rum go.”

“Do not fly too high,” said Aslan. “Do not try to go over the tops of the great ice-mountains. Look out for the valleys, the green places, and fly through them. There will always be a way through. And now, begone with my blessing.”

“Oh Fledge!” said Digory, leaning forward to pat the Horse’s glossy neck. “This is fun. Hold on to me tight, Polly.”

Next moment the country dropped away beneath them, and whirled round as Fledge, like a huge pigeon, circled once or twice before setting off on his long westward flight. Looking down, Polly could hardly see the King and the Queen, and even Aslan himself was only a bright yellow spot on the green grass. Soon the wind was in their faces and Fledge’s wings settled down to a steady beat.

All Narnia, many-coloured with lawns and rocks and heather and different sorts of trees, lay spread out below them, the river winding through it like a ribbon of quicksilver. They could already see over the tops of the low hills which lay northward on their right; beyond those hills a great moorland sloped gently up and up to the horizon. On their left the mountains were much higher, but every now and then there was a gap when you could see, between steep pine woods, a glimpse of the southern lands that lay beyond them, looking blue and far away.

“That’ll be where Archenland is,” said Polly.

“Yes, but look ahead!” said Digory.

For now a great barrier of cliffs rose before them and they were almost dazzled by the sunlight dancing on the great waterfall by which the river roars and sparkles down into Narnia itself from the high western lands in which it rises. They were flying so high already that the thunder of those falls could only just be heard as a small, thin sound, but they were not yet high enough to fly over the top of the cliffs.

“We’ll have to do a bit of zig-zagging here,” said Fledge. “Hold on tight.”

He began flying to and fro, getting higher at each turn. The air grew colder, and they heard the call of eagles far below them.

“I say, look back! Look behind,” said Polly.

There they could see the whole valley of Narnia stretched out to where, just before the eastern horizon, there was a gleam of the sea. And now they were so high that they could see tiny-looking jagged mountains appearing beyond the northwest moors, and plains of what looked like sand far in the south.

“I wish we had someone to tell us what all those places are,” said Digory.

“I don’t suppose they’re anywhere yet,” said Polly. “I mean, there’s no one there, and nothing happening. The world only began today.”

“No, but people will get there,” said Digory. “And then they’ll have histories, you know.”

“Well, it’s a jolly good thing they haven’t now,” said Polly. “Because nobody can be made to learn it. Battles and dates and all that rot.”

Now they were over the top of the cliffs and in a few minutes the valley land of Narnia had sunk out of sight behind them. They were flying over a wild country of steep hills and dark forests, still following the course of the river. The really big mountains loomed ahead. But the sun was now in the travellers’ eyes and they couldn’t see things very clearly in that direction. For the sun sank lower and lower till the western sky was all like one great furnace full of melted gold; and it set at last behind a jagged peak which stood up against the brightness as sharp and flat as if it were cut out of cardboard.

“It’s none too warm up here,” said Polly.

“And my wings are beginning to ache,” said Fledge. “There’s no sign of the valley with a Lake in it, like what Aslan said. What about coming down and looking out for a decent spot to spend the night in? We shan’t reach that place tonight.”

“Yes, and surely it’s about time for supper?” said Digory.

So Fledge came lower and lower. As they came down nearer to the earth and among the hills, the air grew warmer and after travelling so many hours with nothing to listen to but the beat of Fledge’s wings, it was nice to hear the homely and earthy noises again—the chatter of the river on its stony bed and the creaking of trees in the light wind. A warm, good smell of sun-baked earth and grass and flowers came up to them. At last Fledge alighted. Digory rolled off and helped Polly to dismount. Both were glad to stretch their stiff legs.

The valley in which they had come down was in the heart of the mountains; snowy heights, one of them looking rose-red in the reflections of the sunset, towered above them.

“I am hungry,” said Digory.

“Well, tuck in,” said Fledge, taking a big mouthful of grass. Then he raised his head, still chewing and with bits of grass sticking out on each side of his mouth like whiskers, and said, “Come on, you two. Don’t be shy. There’s plenty for us all.”

“But we can’t eat grass,” said Digory.

“H’m, h’m,” said Fledge, speaking with his mouth full. “Well—h’m—don’t know quite what you’ll do then. Very good grass too.”

Polly and Digory stared at one another in dismay.

“Well, I do think someone might have arranged about our meals,” said Digory.

“I’m sure Aslan would have, if you’d asked him,” said Fledge.

“Wouldn’t he know without being asked?” said Polly.

“I’ve no doubt he would,” said the Horse (still with his mouth full). “But I’ve a sort of idea he likes to be asked.”

“But what on earth are we to do?” asked Digory.

“I’m sure I don’t know,” said Fledge. “Unless you try the grass. You might like it better than you think.”

“Oh, don’t be silly,” said Polly, stamping her foot. “Of course humans can’t eat grass, any more than you could eat a mutton chop.”

“For goodness’ sake don’t talk about chops and things,” said Digory. “It only makes it worse.”

Digory said that Polly had better take herself home by ring and get something to eat there; he couldn’t himself because he had promised to go straight on his message for Aslan, and, if once he showed up again at home, anything might happen to prevent his getting back. But Polly said she wouldn’t leave him, and Digory said it was jolly decent of her.

“I say,” said Polly, “I’ve still got the remains of that bag of toffee in my jacket. It’ll be better than nothing.”

“A lot better,” said Digory, “but be careful to get your hand into your pocket without touching your ring.”

This was a difficult and delicate job but they managed it in the end. The little paper bag was very squashy and sticky when they finally got it out, so that it was more a question of tearing the bag off the toffees than of getting the toffees out of the bag. Some grown-ups (you know how fussy they can be about that sort of thing) would rather have gone without supper altogether than eaten those toffees. There were nine of them all told. It was Digory who had the bright idea of eating four each and planting the ninth; for, as he said, “if the bar off the lamp-post turned into a little light-tree, why shouldn’t this turn into a toffee-tree?” So they dibbled a small hole in the turf and buried the piece of toffee. Then they ate the other pieces, making them last as long as they could. It was a poor meal, even with all the paper they couldn’t help eating as well.

When Fledge had quite finished his own excellent supper he lay down. The children came and sat one on each side of him leaning against his warm body, and when he had spread a wing over each they were really quite snug. As the bright young stars of that new world came out they talked over everything: how Digory had hoped to get something for his Mother and how, instead of that, he had been sent on this message. And they repeated to one another all the signs by which they would know the places they were looking for—the blue lake and the hill with a garden on top of it. The talk was just beginning to slow down as they got sleepy, when suddenly Polly sat up wide awake and said “Hush!”

Everyone listened as hard as they could.

“Perhaps it was only the wind in the trees,” said Digory presently.

“I’m not so sure,” said Fledge. “Anyway—wait! There it goes again. By Aslan, it is something.”

The horse scrambled to its feet with a great noise and a great upheaval; the children were already on theirs. Fledge trotted to and fro, sniffing and whinnying. The children tiptoed this way and that, looking behind every bush and tree. They kept on thinking they saw things, and there was one time when Polly was perfectly certain she had seen a tall, dark figure gliding quickly away in a westerly direction. But they caught nothing and in the end Fledge lay down again and the children re-snuggled (if that is the right word) under his wings. They went to sleep at once. Fledge stayed awake much longer moving his ears to and fro in the darkness and sometimes giving a little shiver with his skin as if a fly had lighted on him: but in the end he too slept.





Chapter 13　AN UNEXPECTED MEETING


“Wake up, Digory, wake up, Fledge,” came the voice of Polly. “It has turned into a toffee tree. And it’s the loveliest morning.”

The low early sunshine was streaming through the wood and the grass was gray with dew and the cobwebs were like silver. Just beside them was a little, very dark-wooded tree, about the size of an apple tree. The leaves were whitish and rather papery, like the herb called honesty, and it was loaded with little brown fruits that looked rather like dates.

“Hurrah!” said Digory. “But I’m going to have a dip first.” He rushed through a flowering thicket or two down to the river’s edge. Have you ever bathed in a mountain river that is running in shallow cataracts over red and blue and yellow stones with the sun on it? It is as good as the sea: in some ways almost better. Of course, he had to dress again without drying but it was well worth it. When he came back, Polly went down and had her bathe; at least she said that was what she’d been doing, but we know she was not much of a swimmer and perhaps it is best not to ask too many questions. Fledge visited the river too but he only stood in midstream, stooping down for a long drink of water and then shaking his mane and neighing several times.

Polly and Digory got to work on the toffee tree. The fruit was delicious; not exactly like toffee—softer for one thing, and juicy—but like fruit which reminded one of toffee. Fledge also made an excellent breakfast; he tried one of the toffee fruits and liked it but said he felt more like grass at that hour in the morning. Then with some difficulty the children got on his back and the second journey began.

It was even better than yesterday, partly because every one was feeling so fresh, and partly because the newly risen sun was at their backs and, of course, everything looks nicer when the light is behind you. It was a wonderful ride. The big snowy mountains rose above them in every direction. The valleys, far beneath them, were so green, and all the streams which tumbled down from the glaciers into the main river were so blue, that it was like flying over gigantic pieces of jewellery. They would have liked this part of the adventure to go on longer than it did. But quite soon they were all sniffing the air and saying “What is it?” and “Did you smell something?” and “Where’s it coming from?” For a heavenly smell, warm and golden, as if from all the most delicious fruits and flowers of the world, was coming up to them from somewhere ahead.

“It’s coming from that valley with the lake in it,” said Fledge.

“So it is,” said Digory. “And look! There’s a green hill at the far end of the lake. And look how blue the water is.”

“It must be the Place,” said all three.

Fledge came lower and lower in wide circles. The icy peaks rose up higher and higher above. The air came up warmer and sweeter every moment, so sweet that it almost brought the tears to your eyes. Fledge was now gliding with his wings spread out motionless on each side, and his hoofs pawing for the ground. The steep green hill was rushing toward them. A moment later he alighted on its slope, a little awkwardly. The children rolled off, fell without hurting themselves on the warm, fine grass, and stood up panting a little.

They were about three-quarters of the way up the hill, and set out at once to climb to the top. (I don’t think Fledge could have managed this without his wings to balance him and to give him the help of a flutter now and then.) All round the very top of the hill ran a high wall of green turf. Inside the wall trees were growing. Their branches hung out over the wall; their leaves showed not only green but also blue and silver when the wind stirred them. When the travelers reached the top they walked nearly all the way round it outside the green wall before they found the gates: high gates of gold, fast shut, facing due east.

Up till now I think Fledge and Polly had had the idea that they would go in with Digory. But they thought so no longer. You never saw a place which was so obviously private. You could see at a glance that it belonged to someone else. Only a fool would dream of going in unless he had been sent there on very special business. Digory himself understood at once that the others wouldn’t and couldn’t come in with him. He went forward to the gates alone.

When he had come close up to them he saw words written on the gold with silver letters; something like this:

Come in by the gold gates or not at all,

Take of my fruit for others or forbear,

For those who steal or those who climb my wall

Shall find their heart’s desire and find despair.

“Take of my fruit for others,” said Digory to himself. “Well, that’s what I’m going to do. It means I mustn’t eat any myself, I suppose. I don’t know what all that jaw in the last line is about. Come in by the gold gates. Well who’d want to climb a wall if he could get in by a gate! But how do the gates open?” He laid his hand on them and instantly they swung apart, opening inward, turning on their hinges without the least noise.

Now that he could see into the place it looked more private than ever. He went in very solemnly, looking about him. Everything was very quiet inside. Even the fountain which rose near the middle of the garden made only the faintest sound. The lovely smell was all round him: it was a happy place but very serious.

He knew which was the right tree at once, partly because it stood in the very centre and partly because the great silver apples with which it was loaded shone so and cast a light of their own down on the shadowy places where the sunlight did not reach. He walked straight across to it, picked an apple, and put it in the breast pocket of his Norfolk jacket. But he couldn’t help looking at it and smelling it before he put it away.

It would have been better if he had not. A terrible thirst and hunger came over him and a longing to taste that fruit. He put it hastily into his pocket; but there were plenty of others. Could it be wrong to taste one? After all, he thought, the notice on the gate might not have been exactly an order; it might have been only a piece of advice—and who cares about advice? Or even if it were an order, would he be disobeying it by eating an apple? He had already obeyed the part about taking one “for others.”

While he was thinking of all this he happened to look up through the branches toward the top of the tree. There, on a branch above his head, a wonderful bird was roosting. I say “roosting” because it seemed almost asleep; perhaps not quite. The tiniest slit of one eye was open. It was larger than an eagle, its breast saffron, its head crested with scarlet, and its tail purple.

“And it just shows,” said Digory afterward when he was telling the story to the others, “that you can’t be too careful in these magical places. You never know what may be watching you.” But I think Digory would not have taken an apple for himself in any case. Things like Do Not Steal were, I think, hammered into boys’ heads a good deal harder in those days than they are now. Still, we can never be certain.

Digory was just turning to go back to the gates when he stopped to have one last look around. He got a terrible shock. He was not alone. There, only a few yards away from him, stood the Witch. She was just throwing away the core of an apple which she had eaten. The juice was darker than you would expect and had made a horrid stain round her mouth. Digory guessed at once that she must have climbed in over the wall. And he began to see that there might be some sense in that last line about getting your heart’s desire and getting despair along with it. For the Witch looked stronger and prouder than ever, and even, in a way, triumphant; but her face was deadly white, white as salt.

All this flashed through Digory’s mind in a second; then he took to his heels and ran for the gates as hard as he could pelt; the Witch after him. As soon as he was out, the gates closed behind him of their own accord. That gave him the lead but not for long. By the time he had reached the others and was shouting out “Quick, get on, Polly! Get up, Fledge,” the Witch had climbed the wall, or vaulted over it, and was close behind him again.

“Stay where you are,” cried Digory, turning round to face her, “or we’ll all vanish. Don’t come an inch nearer.”

“Foolish boy,” said the Witch. “Why do you run from me? I mean you no harm. If you do not stop and listen to me now, you will miss some knowledge that would have made you happy all your life.”

“Well I don’t want to hear it, thanks,” said Digory. But he did.

“I know what errand you have come on,” continued the Witch. “For it was I who was close beside you in the woods last night and heard all your counsels. You have plucked fruit in the garden yonder. You have it in your pocket now. And you are going to carry it back, untasted, to the Lion; for him to eat, for him to use. You simpleton! Do you know what that fruit is? I will tell you. It is the apple of youth, the apple of life. I know, for I have tasted it; and I feel already such changes in myself that I know I shall never grow old or die. Eat it, Boy, eat it; and you and I will both live forever and be king and queen of this whole world—or of your world, if we decide to go back there.”

“No thanks,” said Digory, “I don’t know that I care much about living on and on after everyone I know is dead. I’d rather live an ordinary time and die and go to Heaven.”

“But what about this Mother of yours whom you pretend to love so?”

“What’s she got to do with it?” said Digory.

“Do you not see, Fool, that one bite of that apple would heal her? You have it in your pocket. We are here by ourselves and the Lion is far away. Use your Magic and go back to your own world. A minute later you can be at your Mother’s bedside, giving her the fruit. Five minutes later you will see the colour coming back to her face. She will tell you the pain is gone. Soon she will tell you she feels stronger. Then she will fall asleep—think of that; hours of sweet natural sleep, without pain, without drugs. Next day everyone will be saying how wonderfully she has recovered. Soon she will be quite well again. All will be well again. Your home will be happy again. You will be like other boys.”

“Oh!” gasped Digory as if he had been hurt, and put his hand to his head. For he now knew that the most terrible choice lay before him.

“What has the Lion ever done for you that you should be his slave?” said the Witch. “What can he do to you once you are back in your own world? And what would your Mother think if she knew that you could have taken her pain away and given her back her life and saved your Father’s heart from being broken, and that you wouldn’t—that you’d rather run messages for a wild animal in a strange world that is no business of yours?”

“I—I don’t think he is a wild animal,” said Digory in a dried-up sort of voice. “He is—I don’t know—”

“Then he is something worse,” said the Witch. “Look what he has done to you already; look how heartless he has made you. That is what he does to everyone who listens to him. Cruel, pitiless boy! you would let your own Mother die rather than—”

“Oh shut up,” said the miserable Digory, still in the same voice. “Do you think I don’t see? But I—I promised.”

“Ah, but you didn’t know what you were promising. And no one here can prevent you.”

“Mother herself,” said Digory, getting the words out with difficulty, “wouldn’t like it—awfully strict about keeping promises—and not stealing—and all that sort of thing. She’d tell me not to do it—quick as anything—if she was here.”

“But she need never know,” said the Witch, speaking more sweetly than you would have thought anyone with so fierce a face could speak. “You wouldn’t tell her how you’d got the apple. Your Father need never know. No one in your world need know anything about this whole story. You needn’t take the little girl back with you, you know.”

That was where the Witch made her fatal mistake. Of course Digory knew that Polly could get away by her own ring as easily as he could get away by his. But apparently the Witch didn’t know this. And the meanness of the suggestion that he should leave Polly behind suddenly made all the other things the Witch had been saying to him sound false and hollow. And even in the midst of all his misery, his head suddenly cleared, and he said (in a different and much louder voice):

“Look here; where do you come into all this? Why are you so precious fond of my Mother all of a sudden? What’s it got to do with you? What’s your game?”

“Good for you, Digs,” whispered Polly in his ear. “Quick! Get away now.” She hadn’t dared to say anything all through the argument because, you see, it wasn’t her Mother who was dying.

“Up then,” said Digory, heaving her on to Fledge’s back and then scrambling up as quickly as he could. The horse spread its wings.

“Go then, Fools,” called the Witch. “Think of me, Boy, when you lie old and weak and dying, and remember how you threw away the chance of endless youth! It won’t be offered you again.”

They were already so high that they could only just hear her. Nor did the Witch waste any time gazing up at them; they saw her set off northward down the slope of the hill.

They had started early that morning and what happened in the garden had not taken very long, so that Fledge and Polly both said they would easily get back to Narnia before nightfall. Digory never spoke on the way back, and the others were shy of speaking to him. He was very sad and he wasn’t even sure all the time that he had done the right thing; but whenever he remembered the shining tears in Aslan’s eyes he became sure.

All day Fledge flew steadily with untiring wings; eastward with the river to guide him, through the mountains and over the wild wooded hills, and then over the great waterfall and down, and down, to where the woods of Narnia were darkened by the shadow of the mighty cliff, till at last, when the sky was growing red with sunset behind them, he saw a place where many creatures were gathered together by the riverside. And soon he could see Aslan himself in the midst of them. Fledge glided down, spread out his four legs, closed his wings, and landed cantering. Then he pulled up. The children dismounted. Digory saw all the animals, dwarfs, satyrs, nymphs, and other things drawing back to the left and right to make way for him. He walked up to Aslan, handed him the apple and said:

“I’ve brought you the apple you wanted, sir.”





Chapter 14　THE PLANTING OF THE TREE


“Well done,” said Aslan in a voice that made the earth shake. Then Digory knew that all the Narnians had heard those words and that the story of them would be handed down from father to son in that new world for hundreds of years and perhaps forever. But he was in no danger of feeling conceited for he didn’t think about it at all now that he was face to face with Aslan. This time he found he could look straight into the Lion’s eyes. He had forgotten his troubles and felt absolutely content.

“Well done, son of Adam,” said the Lion again. “For this fruit you have hungered and thirsted and wept. No hand but yours shall sow the seed of the Tree that is to be the protection of Narnia. Throw the apple toward the river bank where the ground is soft.”

Digory did as he was told. Everyone had grown so quiet that you could hear the soft thump where it fell into the mud.

“It is well thrown,” said Aslan. “Let us now proceed to the coronation of King Frank of Narnia and Helen his Queen.”

The children now noticed these two for the first time. They were dressed in strange and beautiful clothes, and from their shoulders rich robes flowed out behind them to where four dwarfs held up the King’s train and four rivernymphs the Queen’s. Their heads were bare; but Helen had let her hair down and it made a great improvement in her appearance. But it was neither hair nor clothes that made them look so different from their old selves. Their faces had a new expression, especially the King’s. All the sharpness and cunning and quarrelsomeness which he had picked up as a London cabby seemed to have been washed away, and the courage and kindness which he had always had were easier to see. Perhaps it was the air of the young world that had done it, or talking with Aslan, or both.

“Upon my word,” whispered Fledge to Polly. “My old master’s been changed nearly as much as I have! Why, he’s a real master now.”

“Yes, but don’t buzz in my ear like that,” said Polly. “It tickles so.”

“Now,” said Aslan, “some of you undo that tangle you have made with those trees and let us see what we shall find there.”

Digory now saw that where four trees grew close together their branches had all been laced together or tied together with switches so as to make a sort of cage. The two Elephants with their trunks and a few dwarfs with their little axes soon got it all undone. There were three things inside. One was a young tree that seemed to be made of gold; the second was a young tree that seemed to be made of silver; but the third was a miserable object in muddy clothes, sitting hunched up between them.

“Gosh!” whispered Digory. “Uncle Andrew!”

To explain all this we must go back a bit. The Beasts, you remember, had tried planting and watering him. When the watering brought him to his senses, he found himself soaking wet, buried up to his thighs in earth (which was quickly turning into mud) and surrounded by more wild animals than he had ever dreamed of in his life before. It is perhaps not surprising that he began to scream and howl. This was in a way a good thing, for it at last persuaded everyone (even the Warthog) that he was alive. So they dug him up again (his trousers were in a really shocking state by now). As soon as his legs were free he tried to bolt, but one swift curl of the Elephant’s trunk round his waist soon put an end to that. Everyone now thought he must be safely kept somewhere till Aslan had time to come and see him and say what should be done about him. So they made a sort of cage or coop all round him. They then offered him everything they could; think of to eat.

The Donkey collected great piles of thistles and threw them in, but Uncle Andrew didn’t seem to care about them. The Squirrels bombarded him with volleys of nuts, but he only covered his head with his hands and tried to keep out of the way. Several birds flew to and fro diligently dropping worms on him. The Bear was especially kind. During the afternoon he found a wild bees’ nest and instead of eating it himself (which he would very much like to have done) this worthy creature brought it back to Uncle Andrew. But this was in fact the worst failure of all. The Bear lobbed the whole sticky mass over the top of the enclosure and unfortunately it hit Uncle Andrew slap in the face (not all the bees were dead). The Bear, who would not at all have minded being hit in the face by a honeycomb himself, could not understand why Uncle Andrew staggered back, slipped, and sat down. And it was sheer bad luck that he sat down on the pile of thistles. “And anyway,” as the Warthog said, “quite a lot of honey has got into the creature’s mouth and that’s bound to have done it some good.” They were really getting quite fond of their strange pet and hoped that Aslan would allow them to keep it. The cleverer ones were quite sure by now that at least some of the noises which came out of his mouth had a meaning. They christened him Brandy because he made that noise so often.

In the end, however, they had to leave him there for the night. Aslan was busy all that day instructing the new King and Queen and doing other important things, and could not attend to “poor old Brandy.” What with the nuts, pears, apples, and bananas that had been thrown in to him, he did fairly well for supper; but it wouldn’t be true to say that he passed an agreeable night.

“Bring out that creature,” said Aslan. One of the Elephants lifted Uncle Andrew in its trunk and laid him at the Lion’s feet. He was too frightened to move.

“Please, Aslan,” said Polly, “could you say something to—to unfrighten him? And then could you say something to prevent him from ever coming back here again?”

“Do you think he wants to?” said Aslan.

“Well, Aslan,” said Polly, “he might send someone else. He’s so excited about the bar off the lamp-post growing into a lamp-post tree and he thinks—”

“He thinks great folly, child,” said Aslan. “This world is bursting with life for these few days because the song with which I called it into life still hangs in the air and rumbles in the ground. It will not be so for long. But I cannot tell that to this old sinner, and I cannot comfort him either; he has made himself unable to hear my voice. If I spoke to him, he would hear only growlings and roarings. Oh Adam’s sons, how cleverly you defend yourselves against all that might do you good! But I will give him the only gift he is still able to receive.”

He bowed his great head rather sadly, and breathed into the Magician’s terrified face. “Sleep,” he said. “Sleep and be separated for some few hours from all the torments you have devised for yourself.” Uncle Andrew immediately rolled over with closed eyes and began breathing peacefully.

“Carry him aside and lay him down,” said Aslan. “Now, dwarfs! Show your smith-craft. Let me see you make two crowns for your King and Queen.”

More Dwarfs than you could dream of rushed forward to the Golden Tree. They had all its leaves stripped off, and some of its branches torn off too, before you could say Jack Robinson. And now the children could see that it did not merely look golden but was of real, soft gold. It had of course sprung up from the half-sovereigns which had fallen out of Uncle Andrew’s pocket when he was turned upside down; just as the silver had grown up from the half-crowns. From nowhere, as it seemed, piles of dry brushwood for fuel, a little anvil, hammers, tongs, and bellows were produced. Next moment (how those dwarfs loved their work!) the fire was blazing, the bellows were roaring, the gold was melting, the hammers were clinking. Two Moles, whom Aslan had set to dig (which was what they liked best) earlier in the day, poured out a pile of precious stones at the dwarfs’ feet. Under the clever fingers of the little smiths two crowns took shape—not ugly, heavy things like modern European crowns, but light, delicate, beautifully shaped circles that you could really wear and look nicer by wearing. The King’s was set with rubies and the Queen’s with emeralds.

When the crowns had been cooled in the river Aslan made Frank and Helen kneel before him and he placed the crowns on their heads. Then he said, “Rise up King and Queen of Narnia, father and mother of many kings that shall be in Narnia and the Isles and Archenland. Be just and merciful and brave. The blessing is upon you.”

Then everyone cheered or bayed or neighed or trumpeted or clapped its wings and the royal pair stood looking solemn and a little shy, but all the nobler for their shyness. And while Digory was still cheering he heard the deep voice of Aslan beside him, saying:

“Look!”

Everyone in that crowd turned its head, and then everyone drew a long breath of wonder and delight. A little way off, towering over their heads, they saw a tree which had certainly not been there before. It must have grown up silently, yet swiftly as a flag rises when you pull it up on a flagstaff, while they were all busied about the coronation. Its spreading branches seemed to cast a light rather than a shade, and silver apples peeped out like stars from under every leaf. But it was the smell which came from it, even more than the sight, that had made everyone draw in their breath. For a moment one could hardly think about anything else.

“Son of Adam,” said Aslan, “you have sown well. And you, Narnians, let it be your first care to guard this Tree, for it is your Shield. The Witch of whom I told you has fled far away into the North of the world; she will live on there, growing stronger in dark Magic. But while that Tree flourishes she will never come down into Narnia. She dare not come within a hundred miles of the Tree, for its smell, which is joy and life and health to you, is death and horror and despair to her.”

Everyone was staring solemnly at the Tree when Aslan suddenly swung round his head (scattering golden gleams of light from his mane as he did so) and fixed his large eyes on the children. “What is it, children?” he said, for he caught them in the very act of whispering and nudging one another.

“Oh—Aslan, sir,” said Digory, turning red, “I forgot to tell you. The Witch has already eaten one of those apples, one of the same kind that Tree grew from.” He hadn’t really said all he was thinking, but Polly at once said it for him (Digory was always much more afraid than she of looking a fool).

“So we thought, Aslan,” she said, “that there must be some mistake, and she can’t really mind the smell of those apples.”

“Why do you think that, Daughter of Eve?” asked the Lion.

“Well, she ate one.”

“Child,” he replied, “that is why all the rest are now a horror to her. That is what happens to those who pluck and eat fruits at the wrong time and in the wrong way. The fruit is good, but they loathe it ever after.”

“Oh I see,” said Polly. “And I suppose because she took it in the wrong way it won’t work for her. I mean it won’t make her always young and all that?”

“Alas,” said Aslan, shaking his head. “It will. Things always work according to their nature. She has won her heart’s desire; she has unwearying strength and endless days like a goddess. But length of days with an evil heart is only length of misery and already she begins to know it. All get what they want; they do not always like it.”

“I—I nearly ate one myself, Aslan,” said Digory. “Would I—”

“You would, child,” said Aslan. “For the fruit always works—it must work—but it does not work happily for any who pluck it at their own will. If any Narnian, unbidden, had stolen an apple and planted it here to protect Narnia, it would have protected Narnia. But it would have done so by making Narnia into another strong and cruel empire like Charn, not the kindly land I mean it to be. And the Witch tempted you to do another thing, my son, did she not?”

“Yes, Aslan. She wanted me to take an apple home to Mother.”

“Understand, then, that it would have healed her; but not to your joy or hers. The day would have come when both you and she would have looked back and said it would have been better to die in that illness.”

And Digory could say nothing, for tears choked him and he gave up all hopes of saving his Mother’s life; but at the same time he knew that the Lion knew what would have happened, and that there might be things more terrible even than losing someone you love by death. But now Aslan was speaking again, almost in a whisper:

“That is what would have happened, child, with a stolen apple. It is not what will happen now. What I give you now will bring joy. It will not, in your world, give endless life, but it will heal. Go. Pluck her an apple from the Tree.”

For a second Digory could hardly understand. It was as if the whole world had turned inside out and upside down. And then, like someone in a dream, he was walking across to the Tree, and the King and Queen were cheering him and all the creatures were cheering too. He plucked the apple and put it in his pocket. Then he came back to Aslan.

“Please,” he said, “may we go home now?” He had forgotten to say “Thank you,” but he meant it, and Aslan understood.





Chapter 15　THE END OF THIS STORY AND THE BEGINNING OF ALL THE OTHERS


“You need no rings when I am with you,” said the voice of Aslan. The children blinked and looked about them. They were once more in the Wood between the Worlds; Uncle Andrew lay on the grass, still asleep; Aslan stood beside them.

“Come,” said Aslan; “it is time that you went back. But there are two things to see to first; a warning, and a command. Look here, children.”

They looked and saw a little hollow in the grass, with a grassy bottom, warm and dry.

“When you were last here,” said Aslan, “that hollow was a pool, and when you jumped into it you came to the world where a dying sun shone over the ruins of Charn. There is no pool now. That world is ended, as if it had never been. Let the race of Adam and Eve take warning.”

“Yes, Aslan,” said both the children. But Polly added, “But we’re not quite as bad as that world, are we, Aslan?”

“Not yet, Daughter of Eve,” he said. “Not yet. But you are growing more like it. It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as the Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things. And soon, very soon, before you are an old man and an old woman, great nations in your world will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than the Empress Jadis. Let your world beware. That is the warning. Now for the command. As soon as you can, take from this Uncle of yours his magic rings and bury them so that no one can use them again.”

Both the children were looking up into the Lion’s face as he spoke these words. And all at once (they never knew exactly how it happened) the face seemed to be a sea of tossing gold in which they were floating, and such a sweetness and power rolled about them and over them and entered them that they felt they had never really been happy or wise or good, or even alive and awake, before. And the memory of that moment stayed with them always, so that as long as they both lived, if ever they were sad or afraid or angry, the thought of all that golden goodness, and the feeling that it was still there, quite close, just round some corner or just behind some door, would come back and make them sure, deep down inside, that all was well. Next minute all three of them (Uncle Andrew now awake) came tumbling into the noise, heat, and hot smells of London.

They were on the pavement outside the Ketterleys’ front door, and except that the Witch, the Horse, and the Cabby were gone, everything was exactly as they had left it. There was the lamp-post, with one arm missing; there was the wreck of the hansom cab; and there was the crowd. Everyone was still talking and people were kneeling beside the damaged policeman, saying things like, “He’s coming round” or “How do you feel now, old chap?” or “The Ambulance will be here in a jiffy.”

“Great Scott!” thought Digory, “I believe the whole adventure’s taken no time at all.”

Most people were wildly looking round for Jadis and the horse. No one took any notice of the children for no one had seen them go or noticed them coming back. As for Uncle Andrew, what between the state of his clothes and the honey on his face, he could not have been recognized by anyone. Fortunately the front door of the house was open and the housemaid was standing in the doorway staring at the fun (what a day that girl was having!) so the children had no difficulty in bustling Uncle Andrew indoors before anyone asked any questions.

He raced up the stairs before them and at first they were very afraid he was heading for his attic and meant to hide his remaining magic rings. But they needn’t have bothered. What he was thinking about was the bottle in his wardrobe, and he disappeared at once into his bedroom and locked the door. When he came out again (which was not for a long time) he was in his dressing-gown and made straight for the bathroom.

“Can you get the other rings, Poll?” said Digory. “I want to go to Mother.”

“Right. See you later,” said Polly and clattered up the attic stairs.

Then Digory took a minute to get his breath, and then went softly into his Mother’s room. And there she lay, as he had seen her lie so many other times, propped up on the pillows, with a thin, pale face that would make you cry to look at it. Digory took the Apple of Life out of his pocket.

And just as the Witch Jadis had looked different when you saw her in our world instead of in her own, so the fruit of that mountain garden looked different too. There were of course all sorts of coloured things in the bedroom; the coloured counterpane on the bed, the wallpaper, the sunlight from the window, and Mother’s pretty, pale blue dressing jacket. But the moment Digory took the Apple out of his pocket, all those things seemed to have scarcely any colour at all. Every one of them, even the sunlight, looked faded and dingy. The brightness of the Apple threw strange lights on the ceiling. Nothing else was worth looking at: you couldn’t look at anything else. And the smell of the Apple of Youth was as if there was a window in the room that opened on Heaven.

“Oh, darling, how lovely,” said Digory’s Mother.

“You will eat it, won’t you? Please,” said Digory.

“I don’t know what the Doctor would say,” she answered. “But really—I almost feel as if I could.”

He peeled it and cut it up and gave it to her piece by piece. And no sooner had she finished it than she smiled and her head sank back on the pillow and she was asleep: a real, natural, gentle sleep, without any of those nasty drugs, which was, as Digory knew, the thing in the whole world that she wanted most. And he was sure now that her face looked a little different. He bent down and kissed her very softly and stole out of the room with a beating heart; taking the core of the apple with him. For the rest of that day, whenever he looked at the things about him, and saw how ordinary and unmagical they were, he hardly dared to hope; but when he remembered the face of Aslan he did hope.

That evening he buried the core of the Apple in the back garden.

Next morning when the Doctor made his usual visit, Digory leaned over the banisters to listen. He heard the Doctor come out with Aunt Letty and say:

“Miss Ketterley, this is the most extraordinary case I have known in my whole medical career. It is—it is like a miracle. I wouldn’t tell the little boy anything at present; we don’t want to raise any false hopes. But in my opinion—” then his voice became too low to hear.

That afternoon he went down the garden and whistled their agreed secret signal for Polly (she hadn’t been able to get back the day before).

“What luck?” said Polly, looking over the wall. “I mean, about your Mother?”

“I think—I think it is going to be alright,” said Digory. “But if you don’t mind I’d really rather not talk about it yet. What about the rings?”

“I’ve got them all,” said Polly. “Look, it’s alright, I’m wearing gloves. Let’s bury them.”

“Yes, let’s. I’ve marked the place where I buried the core of the Apple yesterday.”

Then Polly came over the wall and they went together to the place. But, as it turned out, Digory need not have marked the place. Something was already coming up. It was not growing so that you could see it grow as the new trees had done in Narnia; but it was already well above ground. They got a trowel and buried all the magic rings, including their own ones, in a circle round it.

About a week after this it was quite certain that Digory’s Mother was getting better. About a fortnight later she was able to sit out in the garden. And a month later that whole house had become a different place. Aunt Letty did everything that Mother liked; windows were opened, frowsy curtains were drawn back to brighten up the rooms, there were new flowers everywhere, and nicer things to eat, and the old piano was tuned and Mother took up her singing again, and had such games with Digory and Polly that Aunt Letty would say “I declare, Mabel, you’re the biggest baby of the three.”

When things go wrong, you’ll find they usually go on getting worse for some time; but when things once start going right they often go on getting better and better. After about six weeks of this lovely life there came a long letter from Father in India, which had wonderful news in it. Old Great-Uncle Kirke had died and this meant, apparently, that Father was now very rich. He was going to retire and come home from India forever and ever. And the great big house in the country, which Digory had heard of all his life and never seen would now be their home; the big house with the suits of armour, the stables, the kennels, the river, the park, the hot-houses, the vineries, the woods, and the mountains behind it. So that Digory felt just as sure as you that they were all going to live happily ever after. But perhaps you would like to know just one or two things more.

Polly and Digory were always great friends and she came nearly every holidays to stay with them at their beautiful house in the country; and that was where she learned to ride and swim and milk and bake and climb.

In Narnia the Beasts lived in great peace and joy and neither the Witch nor any other enemy came to trouble that pleasant land for many hundred years. King Frank and Queen Helen and their children lived happily in Narnia and their second son became King of Archenland. The boys married nymphs and the girls married wood-gods and river-gods. The lamp-post which the Witch had planted (without knowing it) shone day and night in the Narnian forest, so that the place where it grew came to be called Lantern Waste; and when, many years later, another child from our world got into Narnia, on a snowy night, she found the light still burning. And that adventure was, in a way, connected with the ones I have just been telling you.

It was like this. The tree which sprang from the Apple that Digory planted in the back garden, lived and grew into a fine tree. Growing in the soil of our world, far out of the sound of Aslan’s voice and far from the young air of Narnia, it did not bear apples that would revive a dying woman as Digory’s Mother had been revived, though it did bear apples more beautiful than any others in England, and they were extremely good for you, though not fully magical. But inside itself, in the very sap of it, the tree (so to speak) never forgot that other tree in Narnia to which it belonged. Sometimes it would move mysteriously when there was no wind blowing: I think that when this happened there were high winds in Narnia and the English tree quivered because, at that moment, the Narnia tree was rocking and swaying in a strong southwestern gale. However that might be, it was proved later that there was still magic in its wood. For when Digory was quite middle-aged (and he was a famous learned man, a Professor, and a great traveller by that time) and the Ketterleys’ old house belonged to him, there was a great storm all over the south of England which blew the tree down. He couldn’t bear to have it simply chopped up for firewood, so he had part of the timber made into a wardrobe, which he put in his big house in the country. And though he himself did not discover the magic properties of that wardrobe, someone else did. That was the beginning of all the comings and goings between Narnia and our world, which you can read of in other books.

When Digory and his people went to live in the big country house, they took Uncle Andrew to live with them; for Digory’s Father said, “We must try to keep the old fellow out of mischief, and it isn’t fair that poor Letty should have him always on her hands.” Uncle Andrew never tried any Magic again as long as he lived. He had learned his lesson, and in his old age he became a nicer and less selfish old man than he had ever been before. But he always liked to get visitors alone in the billiard-room and tell them stories about a mysterious lady, a foreign royalty, with whom he had driven about London. “A devilish temper she had,” he would say. “But she was a dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman.”
