引言


搭乘皇家“贝格尔”号周游世界时，身为博物学者，我对南美洲的生物分布以及现存生物和古生物的地质关系颇为留意。某些情况似乎让我对物种起源略有所悟——这是个谜中谜，正如一位极伟大的哲学家说过的。回国后的1837年，我灵机一动，耐心深入搜集有关的资料，加以融会贯通，这个问题也许可以有所心得的嘛。经过五年努力之后，我斗胆对该主题进行了思辨，并记了些简短的笔记；1844年又把它扩充为一份结论提纲，当时在我看来算是有点眉目了。从那以后，我始终不渝，孜孜以求。希望读者原谅我扯个人的琐事，说出来是为了表明，我的决定并非草率做出。

如今，我的研究工作即将告一段落，但离彻底完成还需投入两三年时间，而且我现在身体不算强壮，便有人劝我先发表了这份摘要再说。特别促使我这样做的，是研究马来群岛博物学的华莱士先生对于物种起源所做的一般结论，竟几乎和我不谋而合。去年，他把一份有关本主题的研究报告寄给了我，要求我转交查尔斯·赖尔（Charles Lyell）爵士，爵士把它交给了林奈学会，刊登在该学会第三卷学报上。赖尔爵士和胡克博士都了解我的研究，胡克还读过我1844年写的纲要，他们认为最好把我原稿的若干章节和华莱士先生的优秀论文同时发表。我不胜荣幸。

现在发表的这个摘要必定不够完善。这里无法为我的若干论述提出参考文献和权威典籍，有必要拜托读者对我的论述精确性有所信任。错误在所难免，虽然自认一贯小心谨慎，只信赖可靠的典籍。本书仅仅能给出我所得到的一般结论，用少量事实来做实例，希望在大多数情况下这就足够了。今后有必要把我做结论所依据的全部事实以及参考资料一五一十发表出来，这一点我比谁都念念不忘的；希望将来的著作中能做到。我很清楚，本书所讨论的，几乎没有一点不能用事实来举证，而绝不会引出同我的结论直接背道而驰的东西。只有对每一个问题的正反两方面事实和论点加以充分论述，反复权衡，才能得出公平的结果，但这里做不到。

我得到了许多学者的慷慨相助，其中有些素不相识；很遗憾，由于篇幅的限制，无法一一鸣谢。然而，机会难得，一定要对胡克博士深切致谢，最近十五年来，他以丰富的学识和卓越的判断力，千方百计鼎力相助。

关于物种起源，学者们如果对生物的相互亲缘关系、胚胎关系、地理分布、地质演替等等加以思考，那就可以想见会得出如下结论：物种不是独立创造出来的，而是与变种一样，是从其他物种传承下来的。然而，这一结论即使有根有据，也不能令人满意，除非我们能够证明，这个世界的无数物种如何变异才获得了令人赞不绝口的完善构造和相互适应性。学者们始终把可能的变异仅仅归因于外界条件，如气候、食物等。从某一狭义来说，正如后文即将看到的，这可能是正确的；但是，例如把啄木鸟的构造，它的脚、尾、喙、舌，如此绝妙地适应于在树皮下捉昆虫，也仅仅归因于外界条件，则是十分荒谬的。再如槲寄生，它从某些树木吸取营养，种子必须由某些鸟传播，而且是雌雄异花，绝对需要借助某些昆虫来完成异花授粉。用外界条件、习性或植株本身的意志作用来解释这种寄生生物的构造以及它和若干种不同生物的关系，也同样荒谬绝伦。

我想，“创世遗迹”论者会断言，经过不计其数的世代，某鸟生下了啄木鸟，某植物生下了槲寄生，且创造得如我们所见的一样完美；但依我看，这种假设无法自圆其说，未触及和解释生物的相互适应性，以及对其生活条件的适应性。

因此，弄清变异和适应的途径至关重要。刚开始观察时，我就觉得仔细研究驯养动物和栽培植物，对于解决这个难题也许会提供最好的机会。果然功夫不负有心人，通过这种和所有其他的复杂个例，我一个劲儿地发现，有关驯养变异的知识即使不完善，也能提供最好、最可靠的线索。我在此斗胆声明，我坚信这种研究价值很高，虽然学者们往往加以忽视。

有鉴于此，本书第一章讨论驯养变异。我们将看到，大量的遗传变异至少是可能的，更有甚者，我们将看到，人类通过选择积累连续的微小变异，能耐是何等巨大。然后将讨论物种在自然状况下的变异性；不幸的是，讨论这个问题不得不简而又简，因为只有罗列长篇的事实才能加以妥当处理。然而，我们还能得以讨论什么环境条件最有利于变异。第三章讨论全世界所有生物之间的生存斗争，这是以几何级数高度增殖的必由之路。这就是马尔萨斯（Malthus）学说在整个动物界和植物界的应用。每一物种所出生的个体，大大超过其可能生存的数量，于是生存斗争反复出现，结果任何生物所发生的变异，无论多么微小，只要在复杂多变的生活条件下以任何方式有利于自身，就会有较好的生存机会，这样便被自然选择了。根据强有力的遗传原理，任何被选中的变种都倾向于繁殖其变异了的新形态。

自然选择的基本问题在第四章详述；我们将看到，自然选择几乎不可避免地导致较少改进的生物类型大量绝灭，并且引发我所谓的“性状分歧”（Divergence of Character）。第五章讨论复杂的、不为人知的变异法则和相关生长法则。接下来的四章将对本学说所存在的最明显最重大的难点加以讨论：第一，过渡的难点，也就是难以了解简单生物或简单器官如何变化和改善成高度发展的生物或构造精密的器官；第二，本能的问题，即动物的精神力；第三，杂交现象，即物种杂交的不育性和变种杂交的能育性；第四，地质记录不完全。第十章考察生物在整个时间上的地质演替。第十一章和第十二章讨论生物在整个空间上的地理分布。第十三章论述生物的分类或相互的亲缘关系，包括成熟期和胚胎期。最后一章对全书做一扼要的复述，加上简短的结束语。

只要承认对周围全部生物的相互关系是多么无知，关于物种和变种的起源至今还不甚了了，就不足为奇了。谁能解释某一个物种为什么分布范围广而且为数众多，而另一个近缘物种为什么分布范围狭而为数稀少？这种关系至关重要，决定着世界一切生物现在的繁盛，并且我相信也决定着它们未来的成功和变异。至于世界上无数生物在史上诸多既往地质时代里的相互关系，我们就所知甚少了。虽然诸多问题至今模糊不清，而且还会长期如此，但经过尽可能从容的斟酌研究和冷静判断，我毫不怀疑，许多学者还保持着的和我以前所持的观点——即每一物种都是独立创造出来的——是错误的。我完全相信，物种不是一成不变的。那些所谓同属的物种都是其单元属已然灭绝的另一物种的直系后裔，正如任何一个物种的公认变种乃是那个物种的后裔一样。另外，我还相信自然选择是变异的主要而非唯一的途径。





第一章　驯化变异


变异性的原因——习性的效果——相关生长——遗传——家养变种的性状——难以区别变种和物种——来自一个以上物种的家养变种起源——各种家鸽，差异和起源——古代依据的选择原理及其效果——有计划选择和无意识选择——家养产品的未知起源——有利于人工选择的情况

对于古老的栽培植物和驯养动物来说，我们观察其同一变种或亚变种时，最先注意到的要点之一，便是个体差异一般远比自然状况下的任何物种或变种来得大。栽培植物和驯养动物品种繁多，古往今来在千差万别的气候和待遇下发生了变异，我们只消对此加以思索，势必得出结论：这种巨大的变异性，是由于家养生物所处的生活条件，不像亲种在自然状况下的生活条件那么千篇一律，而是有所不同。依我看，奈特（Andrew Knight）提出的观点亦有一定的可能性；他认为这种变异性也许在某种程度上与食料过量相关。似乎很明显，生物必须在新条件下生长数世代才能发生任何可察觉变异；并且，生物体制一旦开始变异，一般能够继续变异许多世代。能变异的有机体在培育下停止变异的个案，尚未见于记载。最古老的栽培植物，例如小麦，至今还在经常性地产生新变种；最古老的驯养动物，至今还能迅速地改良或变异。

无论何种原因的变异性，一般是在生命的什么阶段发生作用的，是胚胎发育的前期还是后期，还是在受孕的时刻，这一直有争论。乔弗罗伊·圣提雷尔（Geoffroy St. Hilaire）的实验结果表明，胚胎的不自然处理可致畸，而畸形与普通的变异没有任何清晰的界线分开。可是我强烈怀疑，变异性的最常见原因，可能归结于雌雄生殖质在受孕之前就受到了影响。我这么认为，原因有若干。而主要原因是圈养或者栽培对于生殖系统功能的影响非同小可；面对生活条件的任何变化，生殖系统似乎远比任何其他器官易感得多。驯养动物易如反掌，而要让圈养的动物自由生育，即使雌雄交配的个案不少，也是难上加难。有多少动物，即使在原产地松散圈养，长期生活，也不能生育！人们一般把这种情形归因于本能受损，但许多栽培植物表现得极其茁壮，却极少结实，或从不结实！已经在少数这种个案中发现，很微小的变化，如在某一个生长期内，水分多些或少些，便能决定植物是否结实。关于这个奇怪的问题，我所搜集的细节洋洋洒洒，无法在此详述。要说明决定圈养动物生殖的法则是多么奇妙，我只需提及食肉动物，即使是从热带来的，也能颇为自由地在英国圈养中生育，只有跖行动物即熊科动物例外；然而食肉鸟，除极少数例外，几乎都不会产下受精卵。许多外来的植物，花粉完全不中用，情况同最不能生育的杂种一模一样。一方面，我们看到多种家养的动植物，虽然常常体弱多病，却能在圈养中自由生育；另一方面，我们看到一些个体虽然自幼就被从自然界中抓来，已经完全驯化，而且长命和强健（关于这点，我可以举出无数事例），然而生殖系统由于未知原因而受到了严重影响，以致失去作用；那么，即使生殖系统在圈养中发生作用，其作用不规则，并且所生的后代同双亲不全相像，或者有变异性，就不足为奇了。

都说不育性是园艺学的毒药，但我们依同理将变异性归咎于产生不育性的同样原因，而变异性是园艺中所有精品的来源。我还要补充一下，正如有些生物能够在最不自然的条件下（例如养在箱内的兔及貂）自由生育，这表明其生殖系统未受损，有些动物和植物也能够经受住家养或栽培，而且变化轻微，不亚于在自然状况下。

关于“芽变植物”（sporting plants），可以随便列成一个长表。这个园艺术语指的是，植株会突然生出一个芽，与同株的其他芽不同，具有新的有时是显著不同的性状。可用嫁接等方法来繁殖这种芽，有时候也可用种子。这种“芽变”自然状况下极少见，但栽培状况下则不罕见。在这个个案中，我们看到处理亲本影响了一个枝芽，而不是胚珠或者花粉。但大多数生理学者认为，芽和胚珠在最初形成阶段并无本质区别，所以实际上，“芽变”支持我的观点，即变异性大致可以归结于受精动作之前亲本处理对于胚珠或者花粉影响，或者两者兼而有之。反正这些个案表明，变异不一定如某些作者假设的那样与生殖动作相关。

同一水果的幼苗，同胎中的幼体，有时彼此大不相同，尽管米勒说过，幼体与亲本显然处于毫无二致的生活条件之中。这表明生活条件的直接影响相对于繁殖定律、生长定律、遗传定律来说是多么的微不足道。如果条件的作用是直接的，那么任何幼体一出现变异，全体也许会以同样方式变异的。对于任何变异，我们很难判断在多大程度上归结于热量、水分、光线、食物等等直接动作。我的印象是，对于动物，这种力量产生的直接影响微乎其微，但对于植物看起来影响要大一些。根据这一观点，巴克曼（Buckman）先生最近对植物做的实验似乎极有价值。当处于某种条件下的所有或者几乎所有个体受到同样方式的影响，乍一看变化似乎是直接受到这种条件的影响，但有时候可以说明，相反的条件会产生类似的结构变化。不过，依我看，少许的轻微变化可以归结为生活条件的直接影响，比如增加食量有时候就扩大了个头，某种食物能产生色彩，光线能产生色彩，气候变化也许能使皮毛增厚。

习性也具有决定性的影响，如植物从一种气候移植到另一种气候，就可影响开花期。动物则有更显著的影响，例如我发现家鸭的翅骨与整体骨骼的比重比野鸭轻，腿骨却比野鸭的腿骨重。我看这种变化可以稳妥地归结于家鸭比其野生的祖先少飞多走。奶牛和奶山羊的乳房，在惯于挤奶的国家就比其他地方发育得更大，而这种发育是遗传的，这是使用产生影响的另一例子。在某些国家，所有家养动物的耳朵都是下垂的，有人认为耳朵的下垂是由于动物很少受危险惊吓而耳朵肌肉不使用的缘故，这种观点似乎有道理。

许多法则支配着变异，少数几条依稀可见，容后略加讨论。这里只打算提一下所谓的相关生长现象。胚胎或幼虫发生任何变化，几乎肯定会引起成熟动物也发生变化。畸形生物身上不同部位之间的相关性是很奇怪的；关于这个问题，圣提雷尔的大作里记载了许多事例。饲养者们相信，四肢长几乎都伴随着长脑袋。有些相关的例子十分奇怪，例如蓝眼睛的猫一般都耳聋。体色和体质特性的关联，在动植物中都有许多显著的例子。据霍依兴格（Heusinger）所搜集的事实来看，白毛绵羊和白毛猪吃了某些有毒植物会受到损害，而深色毛的个体则不会。无毛的狗，牙齿不全；长毛和粗毛的动物，据说易于出长角或多角；毛脚的鸽，外趾间有皮；短嘴的鸽，脚小；长嘴的鸽，脚大。因此，人如果继续选择任何特性，就此加强它，那么由于神秘的相关生长法则，几乎肯定会在无意中改变身体结构的其他部位。

未知的或仅依稀可见的各种变异法则，造成了极其复杂，多种多样的结果。关于几种古老的栽培植物如风信子（hyacinth）、马铃薯，甚至大理花等的若干论文，非常值得细读；看到变种和亚变种之间在构造和体质的无数点上的彼此轻微差异，的确令人感到惊奇。生物的全部体制似乎变成可塑的了，倾向于很轻微地偏离其亲类型的体制。

凡是不遗传的变异，与我们无关。但是能遗传的构造上的偏差，不论在生理上是轻微的，还是重要的，其数量和多样性是无限的。卢卡斯博士（Prosper Lucas）的两大卷论文，是关于这个问题的最充实最优秀的著作。没有一个饲养者怀疑，遗传倾向有多么的强；类生类（Like produces like）是基本的信念：只有空谈理论的人才对这个原理有所怀疑。当偏差层出不穷，并且均见于父与子，我们说不清这是否由于同一原因作用于二者的结果。但是，在显然处于同样条件下的个体中间，由于环境条件的异常组合，而亲代出现任何很罕见的偏差（比如在数百万个体中，偶然出现一个），并且又重现于子代，那么我们光凭机缘说就几乎不得不把重现归结于遗传。大家想必都听说过白化病、皮肤刺痛及身上多毛等出现在同一家庭中几个成员身上的情况。如果奇异而稀少的构造偏差确是遗传的，那么不大奇异的普通偏差，当然也可以认为是遗传的了。把各种性状的遗传看作规律，把不遗传看作异常，大概是看待整个问题的正道。

支配遗传的法则是未知的。没有人能说清，同种的不同个体间或者异种个体间，同一特性为什么有时候遗传有时候不遗传；为什么子代常常返回去重现祖父母的某些性状，或者重现更远祖先的性状；为什么一种特性常常从一性传给雌雄两性，或只传给一性，比较普通的是传给同性，但并不排他。出现于雄性家畜的特性，常常排他地或者更多地传给雄性，这对我们是颇为重要的事实。有一个更重要的规律，我想是可靠的，即一种特性不管在哪个年龄段初次出现，就倾向于在相当的年龄在后代身上重现，虽然有时候会提早一些。在许多个案中，这绝无例外。例如，牛角的遗传特性，仅在其后代将近成熟时才会出现；而蚕的各种特性，在相应的幼虫期或茧期中出现。但是，遗传病以及其他一些事实，使我相信，这种规律适用于更大的范围，即一种特性虽然没有明显的理由应该在一定年龄出现，可是它在后代身上出现时，偏偏倾向于在父代初次出现的同一时期。我认为，这一规律对解释胚胎学的法则是极其重要的。这些话当然是专指特性的初次出现，而并非指可能作用于胚珠或雄性生殖质的主因而言；同理，短角母牛和长角公牛杂交后，其后代的角变长了，虽然长大了才出现，但显然是由于雄性生殖质的作用。

提起返祖问题，不妨说一说学者们时常提出的论点——家养变种放归到野生状态，就逐渐地但必然地要回归原始祖先的性状。所以，有人曾经说，不能从家养种族以演绎法来推论自然状况下的物种。我曾努力探求，人们是根据什么决定性事实而如此频繁地、大胆地提出上一论点的，但无功而返。要证明它的正确性是很困难的：我们可以稳妥地断言，绝大多数特征显著的家养变种无法在野生状况下生活。许多情况下，我们不知道原始祖先究竟是什么，也就说不清所发生的返祖现象是否近乎完全。为了防止杂交的影响，大概有必要只把单独一个变种放养在它的新家乡。不过，由于变种有时候的确会重现祖代类型的某些性状，所以我觉得这是不无可能的：如果我们能成功地在许多世代里使诸如圆白菜（cabbage）的若干族在极瘠薄土壤上（但在这种情形下，有些影响应归因于瘠土的直接作用）归化或进行栽培，它们大都甚至全部都会回归野生原始祖先的性状。实验能否成功，对于我们的论点并不十分重要；因为实验本身就改变了生活条件。如果能证明家养变种，如果圈养条件不变，如果大群圈养使之自由杂交，通过相互混合遏制构造上任何轻微的偏差，而仍然显示强劲的返祖倾向——即失去它们的获得性状，那么我会同意，不能从家养变种来推论有关物种的事情。但是有利于这种观点的证据毫无踪迹：要断定我们不能使驭马赛马、长角牛和短角牛、各品种鸡、各种日常蔬菜无数世代地繁殖下去，是违反一切经验的。还可以补充一句，自然状态下生活条件真的有变化时，也许会发生性状的变异和返祖；不过，下一章将说明，自然选择将决定这样出现的新性状可保留多久。

当我们观察家养动物和栽培植物的遗传变种，即种族，并且把它们同亲缘近似的物种相比较时，如上所述，我们一般会觉察出各个家养族在性状上不如真种（true species）千篇一律。另外，同一物种的家养族的性状往往略带畸形；我是说，它们彼此之间，和同属的其他物种之间，虽然在若干方面大同小异，但是，当它们互相比较，尤其是同自然状况下亲缘最近的所有物种相比较，往往身体的某一部分有极端的差异。除了畸形性状（还有变种杂交的完全能育性——这一问题容后讨论）之外，同种的家养族的彼此差异，和自然状况下同属的亲缘近似物种差异方式相同，只是大多数情况下差异更小而已。我想，必须承认这一点，因为动植物的家养族中，没有一种不曾被某些能干的鉴定家划作区区变种，同时被另一些能干的鉴定家划作原来不同的物种的后代。如果一个家养族和物种之间存在着显著区别，这个怀疑的源泉便不致如此旷日持久地反复出现了。常有人说，家养族之间的性状差异不具有属别价值。我看可以阐明这种说法是不正确的；但学者们确定究竟什么性状才具有属别价值时，意见千差万别；这种评价目前都是凭经验取得的。而且，根据我下面提出的属别起源，我们无权期望在家养族中常常遇到属别差异。

估计同种的家养族之间的构造差异量时，我们会很快陷入疑团，不知道它们究竟是从一个或几个亲种传下来的。这一点如果能澄清，倒是很有趣的。例如，阐明众所周知纯种繁殖后代的长驱跑狗（greyhound）、嗅血警犬（bloodhound）、（terrier）、长耳猎狗（spaniel）和斗牛狗（bulldog）都是某一物种的后代，就很有分量，使我们怀疑栖息在世界各地的许多密切近似的自然种（例如许多狐类）的不变性。我并不相信狗类是从一个野生亲种传下来的，这一点后面就要讲到；但是，关于其他某些家养物种的族，却有推定的，甚至有力的证据支持这种观点。

常常有人设想，人类选择拿来家养的动植物，都具有非凡的内在变异倾向，也都易于经受住各种气候。这些容纳能力大大地增加了大多数家养生物的价值，对此我并不争辩。但是，未开化人最初驯养一种动物时，怎么知道是否会在连续世代中发生变异，并且经受住别种气候呢？驴和珍珠鸡的变异性弱，驯鹿的耐热力小，普通骆驼的耐寒力小，难道这阻碍它们被家养了吗？我不能怀疑，若从自然状态中取来其他一些动植物，其数目、产地及分类纲目都相等于我们的家养生物，让其在家养状况下繁殖同样多的世代，那么它们平均发生的变异，会像现存家养生物的亲种一样多。

至于大多数自古驯化的动植物，究竟是一个还是多个野生物种传下来的，我看不可能得到定论。驯养动物多源论的主要论点是，在上古记载中，特别是埃及石碑上，发现的家畜品种繁多，而其中有些品种与现存的种类大同小异。哪怕这一点证明属实，不折不扣，普遍适用，我也不以为然，除了某些品种在那里原产，有四五千年历史了，它又能说明什么呢？然而，霍纳（Horner）先生的研究证明，一万三四千年前，尼罗河谷存在开化到了制陶的人类是有一定的可能性的；谁会冒昧声称，在这个古代之前多少年，埃及就不存在拥有半驯化狼狗的野人，就像火地岛、澳大利亚的野人？

我想，这个问题肯定是一笔糊涂账。但我可以在不涉及任何细节的情况下，在此声明，从地理等因素看，家狗从几个野生种遗传而来，我看可能性很大。至于绵羊和山羊，我还没有看法。从布莱斯（Blyth）先生告诉过我的关于印度瘤牛的习性、叫声、体质构造的事实看来，差不多可以确定它的原始祖先和欧洲牛是不同的；若干能干的鉴定家认为，欧洲牛有一个以上野生祖先。关于马，我同几个作者的意见相反，我有所保留地认为，所有的马族都来自一个野生祖先，理由无法在这里提出。布莱斯先生知识渊博，是我最敬重的，他认为所有鸡的品种都是野生印度鸡（Gallus bankiva，红原鸡）的后代。关于鸭和兔，有些品种彼此结构差异很大，我不怀疑，它们都是从普通野生鸭和野生兔传下来的。

某些作者把若干家养族起源于多个原始祖先的学说引入极端，颇为荒谬。他们认为，每一个纯系繁殖的家养族，即使区别性状极其轻微，也各有其野生的原始型。照此说来，仅在欧洲一处，想必生存过不下于二十个野牛种，二十个野绵羊种，若干个野山羊种，甚至在英国一地也有若干个物种了。还有一位作者认为，先前英国所特有的绵羊野生种竟有十一个之多！如果记住，英国现在已没有一种特有的哺乳动物，法国和德国的不同，只有少数哺乳动物反之亦然，匈牙利、西班牙等也是这样，而这些国度各有若干特有的牛羊等品种，那么我们必须承认，许多家畜品种起源于欧洲；既然这些国家都没有拥有作为区别性亲种祖先的若干特有物种，那是从哪里来的呢？印度也是这样。即使是全世界的家狗品种，我完全承认可能是从几个野生种传下来的，也不能怀疑有大量的遗传性变异。意大利长驱跑狗、嗅血警犬、斗牛狗或布莱尼姆犬（Blenheim spaniel）等等同一切野生犬科动物如此不相像，有谁会相信与其酷似的动物在自然状态下自由生存过呢？常常有人信口说，所有的狗族都是由若干原始物种杂交而产生的，但是杂交只能获得好歹介于两亲之间的类型。如果用这一过程来说明几个家养族的起源，我们就必须承认一些极端类型，如意大利长驱跑狗、嗅血警犬、斗牛狗等，曾在野生状态下存在过。何况杂交产生不同族的可能性被大大夸张了。毫无疑问，辅助以对表现所需要的性状的个体杂种进行仔细选择，偶然的杂交可使一个族发生变异，但是要想从两个大相径庭的族或者物种，得到一个中间性的族，我难以置信。西布赖特（J. Sebright）爵士特意为了这一目的进行过实验，结果失败了。两个纯系品种第一次杂交后所产生的子代，其性状尚称一致，有时（我在鸽子中所发现）非常一致，一切似乎很简单；但是当这些杂种互相进行数代杂交之后，简直没有两个是彼此相像的。由此可见，该工作难上加难，甚至是毫无胜算了。当然，要从两个截然不同的品种得到折中品种，非得极端仔细，长期选择不可。我找不到任何记载，说明有由此搞成永久族的个案。




关于家鸽的品种。——我觉得用特殊类群进行研究总是最好的方法，考虑之后，便选取了家鸽。我养了每一个能买到、得到的品种，并且从世界若干地方得到了惠赠的各种鸽皮，特别是埃里奥特（W. Elliot）阁下从印度、默里（C. Murray）阁下从波斯寄来的。关于鸽类已经发表过许多论文，有多种不同文字，其中有些十分古老，因此很重要。我曾和几位养鸽名家交往，并且被接纳加入了伦敦的两个养鸽俱乐部。家鸽品种之多，令人惊异。比较瘤鼻鸽（English carrier）和短面翻飞鸽（short-faced tumbler），可以看出喙部的奇特差异，由此引起头骨的差异。瘤鼻鸽，特别是雄鸽，头部周围的皮也具有奇特发育的肉突；与此相伴随的还有很长的眼睑、很大的外鼻孔以及阔大的口。短面翻飞鸽的喙部外形差不多和雀科鸣禽（finch）相像；普通翻飞鸽有一种奇特的纯属遗传的习性，密集成群地在高空飞翔并且连续翻筋斗。侏儒鸽（runt）身体巨大，喙粗长，足亦大；有些大种家鸽的亚品种，颈项很长，有些翅和尾很长，有些尾特别短。巴巴里家鸽（barb）和瘤鼻鸽品种相近，但喙不长，而是短而阔。球胸鸽（pouter）的身体、翅、腿特别长，嗉囊异常发达，而且以膨胀为荣，很可以令人惊异，甚至发笑。浮羽鸽（turbit）的喙短，呈圆锥形，胸下有倒生的羽毛一列。它有一种习性，不断地微微膨胀食管上部。毛领鸽（Jacobin）的羽毛沿着颈背向前倒竖而成兜状；从身体的大小比例看来，其翅羽和尾羽颇长。顾名思义，帚鸽（trumpeter，意思是喇叭）和笑鸽（laughter）的叫声，与别的品种极不相同。扇尾鸽（fantail）有三十支甚至四十支尾羽，而不是庞大鸽科成员的正常数目——十二或十四支。它们的尾部羽毛都是展开的，并且竖立，优良的品种竟可头尾相触，尾脂腺颇为退化。此外还可举出若干差异比较小的品种。

这几个品种的骨骼，其面骨的长度、宽度、曲度的发育大有差异。下颚的枝骨形状以及长宽，都有极显著的变异。尾椎和荐椎的数目有变异；肋骨的数目也有变异，它们的相对宽度和突起的有无，也有变异。胸骨孔的大小形状有显著变异；叉骨两枝的开度和相对长度也是如此。口裂的相对阔度，眼睑、鼻孔、舌（不总是和喙的长度严格相关）的相对长度，嗉囊和上部食管的大小；尾脂腺的发育和退化；第一列翅羽和尾羽的数目；翅和尾的彼此相对长度及其和身体的相对长度；腿和脚的相对长度；趾上鳞板的数目，趾间皮膜的发达程度，这一切构造都是易于变异的。羽毛完全出齐的时期有变异，孵化后雏鸽的绒毛覆盖状态也是如此。卵的形状和大小有变异。飞行姿势有显著差异，某些品种的叫声和性情有显著差异。最后，还有某些品种，雌雄间彼此略有差异。

总共至少可以选出二十种鸽，如果拿给鸟学家去看，并且告诉他，这些都是野鸟，我想他一定会把它们列为明确定义的物种的。另外，我不相信任何鸟学家会把瘤鼻鸽、短面翻飞鸽、大种家鸽、巴巴里家鸽、球胸鸽以及扇尾鸽列为同属；特别是把这些品种每一个中的若干个纯粹遗传的亚品种（他会叫作物种）指给他看时。

鸽类品种间的差异固然很大，但我充分相信学者们的一般意见是正确的，即它们都是从野生岩鸽（Columba livia）传下来的，这个名称之下还包含几个彼此差异极细微的地方族，即亚种。鉴于我持这一信念的理由中有若干在某种程度上也适用于其他个案，就在这里概括说一说吧。如果这几个品种不是变种，不是来源于岩鸽，那至少必须是从七八种原始祖先传下来的；因为以更少的数目进行杂交，就不可能造成现今这样的家养品种。例如两个品种进行杂交，如果亲代之一不具有大嗉囊的性状，怎能产生球胸鸽呢？这些假定的原始祖先，必定都是岩鸽，它们不在树上生育，也不喜欢在树上栖息。但是，除了野生岩鸽及其地理亚种外，所知道的其他岩鸽只有两三种，而它们都不具有家养品种的任何性状。因此，所假定的那些原始祖先要么在鸽子最初驯化的那些地方至今还生存着，只是鸟类学家不知道罢了，但考虑到它们的大小、习性和显著的性状而言，似乎不会不为人知的；要么它们在野生状态下想必都灭绝了。但是，在岩崖上生育的善飞的鸟，不大可能被消灭；而具有家养品种同样习性的普通岩鸽，即使在英国的小岛、地中海的海岸上，也都没有消灭。因此，假定与岩鸽习性相似的这么多的物种已绝灭，我看是十分轻率的推测。另外，上述若干家养品种曾被运送到世界各地，想必有几种被带回原产地；但是，除了鸠鸽（dovecot-pigeon）这种稍微改变的岩鸽在若干地方变为野生以外，没有一个品种变为野生的。再者，最近的经验表明，使野生动物在家养状况下自由繁育极其困难；然而，根据家鸽多源说，必须假定至少有七八个物种在古代已由半开化人彻底驯化，所以能在笼养下大量繁殖。

有一个依我看似乎分量很重，并且适用于若干其他个案的论点是，上述诸品种虽然体质、习性、叫声、颜色以及大部分构造与野生岩鸽大体相同，但一部分构造是极异常的。在整个鸽大科里，找不到一种像瘤鼻鸽、短面翻飞鸽、巴巴里家鸽的喙；像毛领鸽的倒羽毛；像球胸鸽的嗉囊；像扇尾鸽的尾羽。因此必须假定，不但半开化人成功地彻底驯化了几个物种，而且有意无意地选出了特别异常的物种；此外，这些物种以后都完全灭绝了，或者湮没无闻了。看来，这许多奇怪的偶然性是绝对不会发生的。

有关鸽类颜色的一些事实很值得考察。岩鸽是深灰青色的，尾部呈白色（印度的亚种——斯特里克兰的青色岩鸽［C. intermedia］尾部呈青色），尾端有一暗色横带，外侧尾羽的外缘基部呈白色，翅膀上有两条黑带。一些半家养的品种和一些看起来真正的野生品种，翅上除有两条黑带之外，更杂有黑色方条纹。全科的任何其他物种都不同时出现这几种标记。而在每一个家养品种里，以良种鸽为例，所有上述标记，甚至外尾羽的白边，有时都是充分发育同时出现。而且，当两个完全不同品种的鸽子进行杂交，虽然都不呈青色，没有上述标记，但其杂种后代却很容易突然获得这些性状。我用几只纯白色扇尾鸽同几只纯黑色巴巴里家鸽进行杂交，它们的杂种是斑驳的褐色和黑色。随后我用这些杂种再进行杂交，纯白色扇尾鸽同纯黑色巴巴里家鸽产生的一只孙辈鸽子，竟然具有任何野生岩鸽一样美丽的青色、白尾、两条黑翼带以及具有条纹和白边的尾羽！如果一切家养品种都是从岩鸽传下来的，根据众所周知的返祖遗传原理，我们就能够理解这些事实。但是，如果否认这一点，就必须做出下列两个很不可能的假设之一。第一，所有想象的各原始祖先，都具有岩鸽那样的颜色和标记，可是没有其他现存物种具有这样的颜色和标记，所以各个品种可能都有重现同样颜色和标记的倾向；第二，各品种，即使是最纯粹的，也曾在十二代，最多二十代之内同岩鸽交配过，我说在十二代或二十代之内，是因为不曾见到有任何事实表明，杂种后代能够返祖到二十代以上。只杂交过一次的品种重现从这次杂交中得到的任何性状的倾向，自然而然越来越弱，因为在以后各代里外来血统将逐渐减少。但是，如果不曾杂交过，而两个亲种都有重现前几代已经消失了的性状的倾向，那么这一倾向能不减弱地遗传到无数代，尽管我们知道有相反的情况。关于遗传问题的论文常常把这两种不同的个案混淆在一起。

最后，所有鸽的家养品种间杂种都是完全能育的。这一点我有自己的观察结果，故意找了最不同的品种。然而两个明显不同动物种的杂种，本身完全能育的，则很难找到个案，也许是根本不存在。有些作者认为，长期连续的家养可消除这种种间不育性的强烈倾向：根据狗类的历史来看，我看这种假设如果用于彼此密切亲缘的物种，有一定的可能性，尽管没有一例实验加以支持。但是，如果把该假设牵强附会，说始祖就具有像今日的瘤鼻鸽、翻飞鸽、球胸鸽和扇尾鸽那样显著差异的物种，会产生完全能育的后代，我看未免过于唐突。

鉴于人类不可能曾使七八个所谓的鸽种在家养状况下自由繁殖；这些所谓的物种从未在野生状态下被发现过，而且也没有在何处变为野生的；这些物种在大多数方面很像岩鸽，但同鸽科的其他物种相比较，却有某些极异常的性状；无论是纯种繁育、杂交，所有品种都会偶尔出现青色和各种标记；杂种后代完全能生育，综上所述，毋庸置疑，所有家养品种都是从野生岩鸽及其地理亚种传下来的。

为了支持此观点，我补充如下：第一，欧洲和印度已发现野生岩鸽能驯养，并且在习性和大多数构造特点上和所有家鸽品种相一致。第二，虽然瘤鼻鸽、短面翻飞鸽在某些性状上和岩鸽大不相同，但是，把这两个族的若干亚品种加以比较，特别是从远地带来的，可以在极端的构造之间组成几乎完整的系列。第三，每一品种的主要区别性状都是尤其易变异的，如瘤鼻鸽的垂肉、长喙，翻飞鸽的短喙，扇尾鸽的尾羽数目，这一点的解释，等论到“选择”的时候便清清楚楚了。第四，鸽类受到许多人极细心的观察、照料和喜爱，它们在世界的若干地方被饲育了数千年。根据莱普修斯（Lepsius）教授向我指出的，关于鸽类的最早记载约在公元前3000年，在埃及第五王朝；但伯奇（Birch）先生告诉我说，在此前的一个王朝已有鸽名记载在菜单上了。普林尼（Pliny）说，罗马时代鸽的价格极高；“嗨，他们居然要核算它们的谱系和族”。印度阿克巴汗（Akbar Khan）非常重视鸽子，大约在1600年，养在宫中的鸽子就不下两万只。宫廷史官写道：“伊朗王和图兰王曾送给他一些珍稀的鸽子；陛下通过杂交，惊人地改良了它们，前人从未用过这方法。”差不多在同一时代，荷兰人也像古罗马人那样对鸽子趋之若鹜。这种关注对解释鸽类所发生的大量变异是极其重要的，详见“选择”章节。后文还可知道，为什么鸽种常常具有畸形的性状。雄鸽和雌鸽容易终身相配，这也是产生不同品种的有利条件；这样，就能把不同品种饲养在一个鸟棚里了。

我已对家鸽的可能起源做了若干论述，但仍然觉得不够。我最初养鸽并观察几类鸽子的时候，很清楚它们都是纯种，我也充分体会到，同样很难相信它们都起源于一个共同祖先，正如任何学者难于对自然界许多雀科鸣禽的物种或其他大类群的鸟做出同样的结论。有一种情形我印象很深，就是所有的家养动物的饲养者和植物的栽培者——我曾经和他们交谈过或者读过他们的文章——都坚信他们所养育的若干品种是从各种不同的原始物种传下来的。请你也像我那样，向赫里福德（Hereford）牛的知名饲养者问一问，他的牛是否从长角牛（long-horns）传下来的，他就会嘲笑你。我遇见过的鸽、鸡、鸭或兔的饲养者，无不坚信各个主要品种是从某一个物种传下来的。凡·蒙斯（Van Mons）关于梨和苹果的论文，全然不信几类苹果，如“里伯斯顿小苹果”“考得林青苹果”，能够从同一株树的种子生出来。其他例子不胜枚举。我想，解释是简单不过的：根据长期不断的研究，他们对几个族间的差异印象深刻；他们熟知各族微有变异，他们因为选择这种轻微差异而得了奖，却无视所有的一般论点，而且也不肯在心里把许多连续世代累积起来的轻微差异总结一下。那些学者所知道的遗传法则，远不如饲养者，对于悠长的世代相传系统中的中间环节也不如饲养者熟悉，饲养者都承认许多家养族是从同一祖先传下来的——当他们嘲笑自然状态下的物种是其他物种的直系后代这个观念时，难道不会学一学谨慎这一课吗？




选择。——现在简要地考虑一下，家养族从一个物种或从几个近似物种产生出来的步骤。有些微小效果也许可以归因于外界生活条件的直接作用，有些微小效果可以归因于习性；但是若要用这等力量来说明驭马和赛马、长驱跑狗和嗅血警犬、瘤鼻鸽和翻飞鸽之间的差异，那就未免胆大妄为了。家养族最显著的特色之一，是我们看中了它们的适应性，倒不是为了动植物自身的利益，而是为了人的使用或爱好。有些于人类有用的变异大概是突然发生的，一步到位的。例如，许多学者认为，生有刺钩的起绒草（fuller's teazle）——这些刺钩是任何机械装置所不及的——只是野生川续断草（Dipsacus）的变种而已，而这种变化量会在一株实生苗上突然冒出。转叉狗（turnspit dog）大概也是这样起源的；我们知道安康羊（ancon sheep）的情形也是如此。但是，当我们比较驭马和赛马，单峰骆驼和双峰骆驼，适于耕地和适于山地牧场，以及羊毛用途各异的不同种类的绵羊时，当我们比较以各种用途为人类服务的许多狗品种时，当我们将争强好胜的斗鸡和很少争斗的品种比较，和从来不孵卵的蛋用鸡、小巧玲珑的矮脚鸡（bantam）比较时，当我们比较无数的农艺植物、蔬菜植物、果树植物以及花卉植物的族时，它们在不同的季节以不同的目的有益于人类，或者美丽非凡令人赏心悦目；我想，我们必须超越区区的变异性之外了。我们无法设想所有品种都是突然产生的，而一产生就像今日所看到的那样完善有用。其实，在若干个案上，我们知道它们的历史并不是这样的。关键就在于人类累积选择的力量：自然给予了连续的变异，人类在对自己有用的一定方向上积累了这些变异。在这种意义上，才可以说人类为自己制造了有用的品种。

这种选择原则的伟大力量不是凭空想象的。确实有几位优秀的饲养者，甚至在一生的时间里，就大大地改变了某些牛羊品种。要充分认识到他们的作为，有必要阅读有关这个问题的论文，有必要考察那些动物。饲养者习惯说动物的体制是可塑的，可以几乎随心所欲地加以塑造。如果篇幅容许，可以从权威的著作中大量引述这种记载。尤亚特（Youatt）对农艺著作的通晓，几乎无人能比，自己就是一位极优秀的动物鉴定者，称选择原则“可以使农学家不仅改变畜群性状，而且加以彻底改造。选择是魔杖，可以随心所欲地让任何形体和模式出生”。萨默维尔（Somerville）勋爵谈到养羊的成就时曾说：“好像饲养者用粉笔在墙壁上画出了完美无缺的形体，然后赋予它生命。”神乎其技的饲养者西布赖特谈到鸽子时说过“他三年就可以产生任何给定的羽毛，而获得脑袋和喙则需要六年”。在撒克逊，选择原则对于美利奴羊（merino sheep）的重要性已得到充分认识，人们以此为业：把绵羊摆在桌子上研究，就像鉴赏家鉴定绘画那样；一共研究三次，各间隔几个月，每次都在羊身上做记号进行分类，最后选择最优良的，作为繁育之用。

英国饲养者的实际成就，可以用优良谱系动物的高昂价格来证明，更何况现在已经出口世界各地。这种改良，决不是普遍归功于不同品种的杂交；最优秀的饲养者都强烈反对这种做法，除了有时杂交亲缘密切的亚品种之外。而在杂交进行以后，严之又严的选择甚至比普通个案更不可或缺。如果选择仅仅在于分离出某个很独特的变种加以繁殖，选择原则就显而易见，不值一提；但选择的重要性却在于鉴别未经训练的眼睛所绝对觉察不出的差异——例如我就实在察觉不出这些差异——并且使之在若干连续世代里，向一个方向累积起来而产生极大的效果。若论准确的眼力和判断力，能成为饲养家的，何止千里挑一。如果有此等天赋，潜心研究它多年，并且坚持不懈，奋斗终生，就会功成名就，可望做出巨大改良；不具备这种天赋的，必败无疑。很少人心悦诚服地相信，连成为熟练的养鸽者，也必须有天赋的才能和多年的实践。

园艺家也遵循相同的原则；但植物的变异常常更易突发。没有人会设想，最精选的生物是原始祖先一次变异产生的。我们有若干个案可资证明，存有精确的档案；如普通醋栗（common gooseberry）的果实是逐渐增大的，就是一个很小的例证。把今日的花同仅仅二三十年前所画的花相比较，就可看到花卉栽培家对许多花做出了令人惊讶的改良。一旦植物的族很好地固定下来，种子繁育者并不是采选最好的植株，而仅仅是巡视苗床，拔除那些劣种，人们把那些脱离标准型的劣种植株叫作“无赖汉”。实际上，对于动物也同样采用这种选择方法；没有人会粗枝大叶地用最劣的动物去繁殖。

关于植物，还有一种方法可以观察选择的累积效果，在花园里比较同种里不同变种的花所表现的多样性；在菜园里把植物的叶、荚、块茎或任何其他有价值部分，在与同一变种的花相比较时所表现的多样性；在果园里把同种的果实在与同一批变种的叶和花相比较时所表现的多样性。看看圆白菜的叶是何等相异，而花又是何等极其相似；三色堇的花是何等相异，而叶又是何等相似；各类醋栗果实的大小、颜色、形状、茸毛是何等相异，而它们的花所表现的差异却极微。倒不是说在某一点上差异很大的变种，在所有其他各点上就毫无差异；这种情况是绝无仅有的。相关生长法则的重要性决不应该忽视，它能保证某些差异的发生；但是，一般地说，我不能怀疑，无论对叶、花，还是对果实的微小变异进行连续选择，就会产生主要在这些性状上有所差异的族。

也许有人会唱反调说，选择原则沦落为循规蹈矩的做法，充其量才七十五年的光景。的确，近年来人们是对它更加关注了，就这问题发表了许多论文，我还要加一句，相应的，其成果也出得快，而且影响大。但是，说该原则是近代的发现，就大错特错了。我可以引用古代著作中若干实例，说明那时已经充分认识到这一原则的重要性。英国历史上的蒙昧未开化时代，常进口精选的动物，并且制订了防止出口的法律；明令规定，马的体量不到一定尺寸就要加以消灭，这相当于苗圃工人拔除植物的“无赖汉”。我看到中国古代的百科全书清楚记载着选择原则。有些罗马经典著作罗列了明确的选择规则。《圣经·创世记》里就阐明，早在那个时期已经注意家畜的颜色了。现在，未开化人有时使家狗和野生犬科动物杂交，以改良品种，古代也曾这样做过，有普林尼的文章为证。南非的未开化人依据挽牛的颜色配对，有些爱斯基摩人对于雪橇狗也这样做。利文斯通（Livingstone）说，未曾与欧洲人接触过的非洲内陆的黑人极重视优良的家畜。某些这种事实虽然并未说明实际的选择过程，但明确了古代人密切关注家畜的繁育，而现今最不开化的人也一样。既然优劣品质的遗传如此明显，若对动植物的繁育不重视，那的确是稀奇古怪了。

目前，饲养家们都按照明确的目的，试用循规蹈矩的选择，来形成优于国内现存种类的新品系或亚品种。但是，为了论述目的，我们更重视某一选择方式，或可称为无意识的选择，因为人人都想拥有最优良的动物个体并加以繁育。例如，打算养指示犬（pointers）的人自然会竭力搜求良种狗，然后用自己拥有的最优良的狗进行繁育，但他并没有持久改变这一品种的期望。然而，我并不怀疑，如果把这一程序继续若干世纪，将会改良并且改变任何品种，正如贝克韦尔（Bakewell）、科林斯（Collins）等等根据同样的程序，只是进行得更循规蹈矩，曾经在他们一生中大大地改变了牛的体形和品质。除非在很久以前，对有关品种就进行实际的计量或细心的描绘以供比较，这种缓慢而不易察觉的变化就永远无法辨识。然而，在某些个案下，同一品种没有变化或略有变化的个体生存在文明落后的地区也是有的，在那里品种是很少改良的。有理由相信，查理王的长耳猎狗自从该朝代以来已经无意识地大大改变了。某些高级权威相信，塞特谍犬（setter）直接来自长耳猎狗，大概是缓慢改变而来的。我们知道，英国指示犬在上一世纪内发生了大变，并且人们相信这次变化的发生，主要是和猎狐狗（fox-hound）杂交所致；但是我们所关心的是：这种变化是无意识地、缓慢地进行的，然而效果却非常显著，虽然以前的西班牙指示犬确实是从西班牙传来的，但博罗（Barrow）先生告诉我说，他没有看见过一只西班牙本地狗和我们的指示犬相像。

经过同样的选择程序和细心训练，全体英国赛马的体量和速度都已超过了亲种阿拉伯马，所以，依照古德伍德赛马的规则，阿拉伯马的载重量被照顾减轻了。斯潘塞勋爵等人曾经指出，英格兰的牛同先前养在国内的原种相比较，其重量和早熟性都大大增加了。把关于瘤鼻鸽、翻飞鸽旧论文中的各种论述，与现存于英国、印度、波斯的品种加以比较，我想，我们便可以清晰追踪出它们不被察觉地经过的各个阶段，从而达到和岩鸽如此大相径庭的地步。

尤亚特举了一个上好的例证，说明一种选择过程的效果，它可以被看作是无意识的选择，因为饲养者根本没有预期过的，甚至没有希望过的结果产生了，这就是说，产生了两个不同的品系。尤亚特先生说，巴克利（Buckley）先生和伯吉斯（Burgess）先生所养的两群莱斯特绵羊（Leicester sheep），“都是从贝克韦尔先生的原种纯正繁殖下来的，持续了五十多年。熟悉这一问题的任何人都根本不会怀疑，上述任何一个所有者曾任何一次脱离过贝克韦尔先生的羊群的纯粹血统，但是两位先生的绵羊彼此间的差异却很大，看起来就像不同的变种”。

如果现在有一种未开化人，野蛮得很，从不顾及家畜后代的遗传性状，然而当他们遇到防不胜防的饥馑或其他不测时，还会把合乎任何特殊目的的对他们特别有用的动物小心保存下来。因此这样选取出来的动物比起劣等动物一般都会留下更多的后代；所以在这个个案中，便进行了一种无意识的选择。我们知道，连火地岛（Tierra del Fuego）的未开化人也重视动物，闹饥荒时他们甚至杀吃年老妇女，认为其价值比狗低。

在植物方面，通过最优良个体的偶然保存可以进行同样的逐步改良过程；不论它们在最初出现时是否有足够的差异可列为独特的变种，也不论是否由于杂交把两个以上的物种或族混合在一起，这种过程都清晰可见。比起旧的变种或它们的亲种，改良就表现在现在所看到的诸如三色堇、蔷薇、天竺葵、大理花等植物的一些变种，在大小和美观方面都有增益。从来没有人会期望从野生植株的种子得到上等的三色堇或大理花。也没有人会期望从野生梨的种子培育出爽口的上等梨，但他可能把野生的瘦弱梨苗培育成良种，如果它本来是从果园砧木来的。梨在古代虽有栽培，但据普林尼的描述看，似乎果实品质极差。我曾看到园艺著作中对于园艺者的绝技表示惊叹，他们竟从如此低劣的材料里培育出如此优秀的结果。不过，这手艺无疑是简简单单的，就其最终结果来说，几乎都是无意识地进行的。这就在于永远是把最有名的变种拿来栽培，播种它的种子，碰巧有稍微好一些的变种出现时，便进行选择，如此这般，一直进行下去。但是，古代园艺者栽培所能得到的最好梨树时，却从未想到我们要吃到什么样的优良果实；尽管我们吃的佳果在某种很小程度上归功于他们，他们是自然而然地选择和保存了他们所能寻获的最优良变种。

我认为，栽培植物这样缓慢地和无意识地累积起来的大量变化，解释了以下的熟知事实，即在大批个案中，我们对于花园和菜园里栽培悠久的植物，已无法辨认，无从知道其野生原种。如果说我们大多数的植物改进或改变到现今于人类有用的标准需要数百年、数千年，那么就能理解，澳大利亚、好望角等未开化人所居住的地方，为什么都不能向我们提供一种值得栽培的植物。拥有如此丰富物种的这些地区，并非由于奇异的偶然而没有任何有用植物的原种，只是因为该地植物还没有经过连续选择改良，以达到像古文明国家的植物那样完善的水平。

关于未开化人所养的家畜，有一点不可忽略，就是至少在某些季节里，几乎总要为吃食而斗争。在环境极其不同的两个地区，体质上或构造上微有差异的同种个体，在这一地区常常会比在另一地区日子好过些；这样，由于以后还要详述的“自然选择”的过程，便会形成两个亚品种。这或者可以部分说明某些作者说过的情况，也就是为什么未开化人所养的变种，比文明国度里所养的变种，具有更多的真种性状。

鉴于上述人工选择所起的重要作用，不言自明，家养族的构造或习性为什么会适应于人类的需要或爱好。我想，我们还能进一步理解，家养族为什么会屡屡出现异常的性状，为什么外部性状的差异如此巨大，而内部器官的差异却相对地如此微小。除了可以看得见的外部性状外，人类几乎不能选择，或只能极其困难地选择构造上的任何偏差；其实对内部器官是很少计较的。除非大自然首先在轻微程度上向人类提供一些变异，人类永远不能动手选择。除非看到一只鸽子在某种轻微程度上尾巴已出现异常发育，人不会去试育扇尾鸽；除非看到一只鸽子嗉囊尺寸已经有些异乎寻常，人也不会去试育球胸鸽；任何性状，在最初露面时越异常，就越能引起人的注意。但是，人类试育扇尾鸽这样的说法，在大多数情况下毫无疑问是完全不正确的。最初选择尾巴略大的鸽子的人，做梦也想不到经过长期连续的、半无意识、半循规蹈矩的选择之后，那只鸽子的后代会变成什么样子。所有扇尾鸽的始祖恐怕只有略微展开的十四支尾羽，就像今日的爪哇扇尾鸽那样，或者像其他品种的个体那样具有十七支尾羽。最初的球胸鸽嗉囊的膨胀程度也许并不比今日浮羽鸽食管上部为大，而所有养鸽者都不管浮羽鸽的这种习性，它不是这个品种的看点之一。

不要以为只有构造上的某种大偏差才会引起养鸽者的注意，他能觉察极小的差异，而且人类本性就在于珍视自家财物的任何新奇点，哪怕是轻微的。决不可用若干品种已经固定后的现今价值标准，去评判以前对同一物种诸个体的任何轻微差异所给予的价值。我们知道鸽子现在还会发生许多轻微的变异，不过此等变异却被当作各品种的缺点或离开完善标准的偏差而舍弃。普通鹅没有产生过任何显著的变种；图卢兹（Toulouse）鹅和普通鹅只在颜色上有所不同，而颜色这种性状极不稳定，但近来却当作不同品种在家禽展览会上展览了。

我想，这些观点进一步解释了有时能注意到的事实——即我们对于任何家养品种的起源或历史一无所知。但是实际上，一个品种就好比语言里的一种方言一样，几乎无法说它有明确的起源。人保存了构造上微有偏差的个体加以繁育，或者格外小心地匹配优良动物从而改良它们，而改良的动物便慢慢地传播到邻近的地方去。但是它们尚无单独的名称，而且很少得到重视，所以它们的历史就遭到忽视。当通过同样的缓慢而逐渐的过程得到进一步改良的时候，它们将传播得更广，并且被承认是单独的有价值的种类，这时大概才首次得到一个地方名称。在半文明的国度里，交通不太发达，新亚种的传播过程是缓慢的，人们会慢慢了解它。一旦其价值点得到充分认识，我称之为无意识选择的原则就会一如既往地有助于慢慢添加这一品种的特性，什么特性都有可能；品种的盛衰依时尚而定，时多时寡；按居民的文明程度，此多彼少。但是，关于这种缓慢、飘忽不定、不易觉察的变化的记载，肯定很少有机会被保留下来。

现在得稍微谈谈有利于或不利于人工选择力的情况。高度的变异性显然是有利的，选择的材料随便供给，有利于选择发生作用；并不是否认哪怕一点点个体差异也是充分够用的，只要极其细心，也能向着几乎任何所希望的方向积累起大量变异。但是，对人们显著有用的或合意的变异只是偶然出现，所以个体如果饲养得多，变异出现的机会也就大量增加。因此，数量是成功的关键。关于这一原则，马歇尔（Marshall）针对约克郡各地的绵羊说过：“因为绵羊一般为穷人所有，并且大部分只是小群圈养，所以从来不能改良。”与此相反，苗圃园艺师栽培着大量的同样植物，在培育有价值的新变种方面，一般远比业余者成功。在任何国家养育一个物种的大群个体，就需要被安置在有利的生活条件下，才能自由繁育。如果个体稀少，不管其品质怎样，一般都得让其全部繁育，这样就会有效地妨碍选择。但最重要的一点也许是，动植物对人类应该十分有用，人类必须高度重视其价值，以致对每个个体品质或构造上的最微小偏差都会给予密切注意。要是没有这样的注意，就会一事无成。我曾见到有人一本正经地指出，正好在园艺者开始注意草莓的时候，它开始变异了，真是极大的幸运。草莓自被栽培以来，无疑是经常发生变异的，只不过微小的变异不曾被注意罢了。然而，一旦园艺者选出一些个体植株，果实稍微大些，稍微早熟些，味道稍微好些，然后从它们培育出幼苗，再选出最好的幼苗进行繁育，于是（在少量种间杂交的辅助下），许多妙不可言的草莓变种就培育出来了。这就是近三四十年来所种植的草莓变种。

至于雌雄各异的动物，防杂交的难易程度是能否形成新族的重要因素——至少在已经放养其他族类的地方是如此。在这方面，圈地能起作用。居无定所的未开化人和开阔平原的居民拥有的同一物种很少超过一个品种。鸽子能终身配对，这对养鸽者大有便利，于是虽混养在一个鸽棚里，许多族还能保纯。这样的条件想必有利于新品种的改良和形成。补充一下，鸽子能大量快速繁殖，劣鸽可杀掉食用，自由淘汰。相反，猫有夜游的习性，无法配对，虽然妇女孩子喜爱，但很少看到独特的品种能长久保存；有时看到的那些独特品种，几乎都是从外国输入的，往往来自海岛。虽然我并不怀疑各种家养动物的变异有多有少，然而猫、驴、孔雀、鹅等的独特品种稀少或干脆没有，则主要归咎于选择未曾发挥作用：猫是由于难以配对；驴是由于只有穷人少量饲养，不重视其繁育；孔雀是由于不容易饲养，种群不大；鹅是由于只有两种用途价值，供食用和取羽毛，特别是由于鹅显示独特种类并不带来愉悦。

现把有关家养族动植物的起源总结一下。我认为，生活条件作用于生殖系统，具有高度的重要性，能造成变异性。某些作者认为，对于所有生物，变异性在一切条件下都是与生俱来，是必然的可能性，这一点我并不苟同。变异性的效应由于遗传和返祖的不同程度而发生变化。变异性是由许多未知的法则所支配的，特别是相关生长法则。有的可以归因于生活条件的直接作用。有的必须归因于使用和不使用。于是，最终的结果便变得无限复杂了。在某些个案中，我并不怀疑，不同原种的杂交，在家养品种的起源上起了重要的作用。在任何地方，若干家养品种一经形成之后，偶然的杂交，辅之以选择，无疑对于新亚种的形成大有帮助；但对于动物和实生植物，依我看变种杂交的重要性就过分地夸张了。对于用插枝、芽接等方法进行暂时繁殖的植物，物种和变种杂交的重要性是极大的，因为栽培者在这里可以不必顾虑杂种和混种的极度变异性以及杂种的不育性；可是非实生植物的个案对于我们不重要，因为其耐久性只是暂时的。我认为，选择的累积作用，无论是按部就班迅速地进行的，还是无意识地缓慢而更有效地进行的，都超出这些变化原因之上，远远是最占优势的“力量”。





第二章　自然变异


变异性——个体差异——存疑的物种——分布广、分散大和普通的物种变异最多——各地大属的物种比小属的物种变异更频繁——大属里许多物种就像变种，有很密切的、但不均等的相互关系，并且分布区域有限

把前一章所得到的各项原则应用到自然状况下的生物之前，必须简单地讨论一下，后者是否容易发生变异。要充分讨论这一问题，必须举出一长列枯燥无味的事实；不过这些我准备留到将来的著作里。这里也不讨论物种这个术语的各种定义。至今没有一项定义能使全体学者都满意；然而谈到物种的时候，他们都模糊地知道是什么意思。这术语一般含有创世作用这一未知要素。“变种”这个术语几乎也是同样地难下定义；但是几乎普遍地蕴含世系群落的意义，虽然很少能够得到证明。还有所谓畸形也难以解释，但它们逐渐变成变种。我认为畸形是指构造上某部分显著偏差而言，对于物种要么是有害的，要么是无用的，一般不加以传播。有些作者是在专门意义上来使用“变异”术语的，它的含义是直接由物理的生活条件所引起的一种变化；这种意义的“变异体”假定为不能遗传的；但是波罗的海半咸水里贝类的矮化状态、阿尔卑斯山顶的矮化植物、极北地区动物的增厚毛皮，谁能说在某些情形下至少不遗传数代呢？我认为这种情况下，该类型是可以称为变种的。

此外，还有许多微小差异，都可叫作个体差异。比如我们熟悉的经常在同父母的后代中所出现的，或者在同一局限区域内栖息的同种个体中所经常观察到的而且可以设想也是这样发生的差异。没有人会假设，同种的一切个体都是在相同的模型里铸造出来的。这种个体差异对于我们十分重要，因为这为自然选择提供了材料，可以积累，就像人类在家养生物里朝着一定方向积累个体差异那样。这种个体差异，一般作用于学者们认为不重要的那些部分；但是我可以用一连串事实阐明，无论从生理学或分类学的观点来看，都必须称为重要的那些部分，有时在同种个体中也会发生变异。我相信，哪怕经验最丰富的学者也会对变异性个案之多感到惊奇，即使是构造的重要部分也不例外；只需花上若干年，就可以同我一样搜集到这种权威的材料。应该记住，分类学家很不乐意在重要性状中发现变异性，而且很少有人愿意费神去检查重要的内部器官，并在同种的许多标本间加以比较。我从来不会料到，昆虫的靠近大中央神经节的主干神经分枝，在同一个物种里会发生变异；本来还认为这种性质的变异只能缓慢地进行；然而最近卢伯克（Lubbock）爵士阐明，胭脂虫（Coccus）的主干神经具有一定程度的变异，几乎可以与树干的不规则分枝相提并论。我补充一句，这位富有哲理的学者最近还阐明，某些昆虫幼虫的肌肉绝非千篇一律。有人说重要器官决不变异，这往往是循环论证，因为正是这些人实际上把不变异的性状当作重要的（少数学者老实坦白过）。在这种观点下，自然就找不到重要器官发生变异的例子了；但在任何其他观点下，却可以确凿地举出许多例子来。

同个体差异相关的，有一点使我非常困惑：我是指有人称为“变形的”（protean）或“多形的”（polymorphic）那些属，其中的物种表现了无节制的变异量。关于这些类型应列为物种还是变种，几乎没有两个学者意见一致。可以举植物里的悬钩子属（Rubus）、蔷薇属（Rosa）、山柳菊属（Hieracium）以及昆虫类和腕足类（Brachiopod shells）的几属为例。在大多数多形的属里，有些物种具有稳定的和一定的性状。除了少数例外，在一个地方为多形的属，似乎在别处也是多形的，并且从腕足类来判断，在早先的时代也是这样的。这些事实很使人困惑，因为它们似乎阐明这种变异是独立于生活条件之外的。我猜想，在某些多形的属里所看到的变异，处于对物种是无用的或无害的构造点，因此，自然选择对于它们就不起作用，从而不能固定下来，详见后文的说明。

有些类型，在相当程度上具有物种的性状，但同其他类型密切相似，或者由中间级进同其他类型密切相关，学者们不愿列为不同的物种；其实它们在若干方面对我们是极其重要的。我们很有理由相信，这些密切亲缘的存疑类型有许多曾在本地长久持续保存它们的性状，据我们所知，和良好的真种一样天长地久。实际上，学者们能够用具有中间性状的其他类型把两个类型连接在一起，就是把一个类型当作另一个的变种；他把最普通的一个，但常常是最初记载的类型作为物种，而把另一个作为变种。可是在决定是否把一个类型作为另一类型的变种时，哪怕两者被中间连锁紧密地连接在一起，也是有严重困难的，我并不准备在这里把这些困难列举出来；即使中间连锁具有一般所假定的杂种性质，也常常不能解决这种困难。然而在很多情形下，一个类型之所以列为另一个的变种，并非因为确已找到了中间连锁，而是因为观察者采用了类推的方法，便假设中间连锁现在确在某些地方生存着，或者它们从前可能生存过；这样，就为疑惑、臆测打开了大门。

因此，当决定一个类型应列为物种还是变种的时候，有健全判断力、丰富经验的学者的意见，似乎是应当遵循的唯一指针。然而在许多情况下，我们必须依据大多数学者的意见来决定，因为很少有标记显著而熟知的变种不曾被至少几位能干的鉴定者列为物种的。

具有这种存疑性质的变种所在皆是，无可争辩。把不同学者所著的几部英、法、美植物志比较一下，就可看出有何等惊人数目的类型，往往先后被列为真物种和区区变种。多方帮助我而使我感激万分的沃森（H. C. Watson）先生告诉我说，现在有182种英国植物一般被当作变种，但是过去统统都被列为物种；开列这张名单时，省略了许多细小的变种，然而它们也曾被列为物种，此外把若干高度多形的属完全省略了。在包含着最多形的类型的属之下，巴宾顿（Babington）先生列举了251个物种，而本瑟姆（Bentham）先生只列举了112个物种——就是说差额有139个存疑类型！在每次生育必须交配、具有高度移动性的动物里，分别被学者列为物种和变种的存疑类型，在同一地区很少看到，但在分隔的地区却很普通。在北美洲和欧洲，有多少鸟和昆虫，彼此差异很微，却分别被大学者或列为无可怀疑的物种，或列为变种，或常把它们称为地理族！多年前，我曾比较过、看别人比较过加拉帕戈斯群岛上鸟类的相互异同，以及这些鸟与美洲大陆的鸟的异同，深深感到物种和变种之间的区别是何等的含糊和任意。小马德拉群岛的小岛上有许多昆虫，沃拉斯顿（Wollaston）先生的力作把它们看作变种，但许多昆虫学者毫无疑问会将它们列为物种。甚至爱尔兰也有少数动物，曾被学者看作物种，但现在一般却被看作变种。若干经验丰富的鸟类学家认为英国的红松鸡只是挪威种的一个特性显著的族，然而大多数人则把它列为英国特有的非存疑物种。两个存疑类型的原产地如果相距遥远，许多学者就会把双方都列为物种；但是，有人问得好，多少距离是足够遥远的呢？如果美洲和欧洲距离足够的话，那么欧洲到亚速尔群岛、马德拉群岛、加那利群岛、爱尔兰之间的距离是否足够呢？必须承认，有许多被鉴定家认为是变种的类型，拥有着完美的物种性状，也就被另外一些鉴定家列为货真价实的物种了。但在这些术语的定义还没有得到普遍接受之前，就来讨论什么应该称为物种，什么应该称为变种，乃是无的放矢啊。

许多关于特征显著的变种或存疑物种的个案，很值得考虑；因为在试图决定它们的级位上，从地理分布、相似变异、杂交等方面已经展开了若干有趣的论据路线。我在这里只提出一个实例——众所周知的报春花属（primrose）和樱草（cowslip）或黄花九轮草（Primula veris）和高报春（elatior）。这些植物外表大不相同，味道不同，气味不同，开花期略微不同，生境有点不同，上山高度不同，地理分布区不同，最后是仔细的观察者盖特纳（Gärtner）多年来所做的大量实验表明，它们杂交非常困难。简直无法指望有更好的证据来证明两个类型是不同物种了。另一方面，它们由许多中间连锁联合起来，而这些连锁是否杂种是存疑的。依我看，铺天盖地的实验证据表明，它们从共同的亲种传下来，因此必须列为变种。

在大多数情形下，过细的调查可以使学者们对存疑类型的分级取得一致的意见。然而必须坦言，在研究得最透彻的地区，所见到的存疑类型的数目也最多。我惊异地发现，如果自然状况下的任何动植物对人极有用，或为了任何原因能引起人们的密切注意，那么它的变种就几乎普遍地记载下来了。而且这些变种往往被某些作者列为物种。看看普通的栎树（oak），研究得何等精细呀；然而，一位德国作者竟从其他学者普遍认为是变种的类型中确定了十二个以上的物种；在英国，可以举出一些植物学的最高权威和实际工作者，有的认为无梗的和有梗的栎树是物种，有的仅仅认为它们是变种。

青年学者开始研究陌生的生物类群时，倍感困惑的首先就是决定什么是物种的差异，什么是变种的差异。他对这个生物类群所发生的变异量和变异种类一无所知；这至少可以表明，生物发生某种变异是多么普遍。但是，如果把注意力集中于一个地区里的某一类生物，就会很快决定如何去分级大部分的存疑类型。他一般倾向于定出许多物种，就像前文讲过的养鸽和养鸡爱好者那样，他所不断研究着的那些类型的差异量将会给他深刻的印象；而在其他地区和其他生物类群的相似变异方面他缺少一般知识，无法用来校正他的最初印象。等到他扩大了观察范围，就会遇到更多困难；他将遇到数目更多的密切近似类型。但是，如果进一步扩大他的观察范围，最后将能够有所决定何谓变种，何谓物种；不过他要在这方面获得成功，代价是承认大量变异，然而这样承认是否正确，往往会引起其他学者的争议。何况，如果从现今已不连续的地区找来亲缘类型加以研究，他就没有希望找到存疑类型的中间连锁，于是不得不几乎完全依赖类推的方法，这就会使他的困难登峰造极。

在物种和亚种之间，当然还没有划出过明确的界限——亚种就是类型里面有些学者认为已很接近物种，但还没有完全达到物种那一级；还有，在亚种和显著的变种之间，在较不显著的变种和个体差异之间也是一笔糊涂账。这些差异被一个不易察觉的系列彼此混合，而该系列令人产生存在实际过渡的印象。

因此，我认为，个体差异虽对分类学家无足轻重，但对我们却很重要，这是分辨轻度变种的第一步，而博物学著作认为不值得记载那些变种。我认为，任何程度上比较显著、比较永久的变种都是走向更显著、更永久变种的步骤；而后者是走向亚种，走向物种的步骤。从一个阶段的差异到另一个高级阶段的过渡，在某种情况下，可能仅仅是由于长久连续居于两个不同地区不同物理条件之下的结果；但这种观点使我信心不足。我把一个变种从略不同于亲种的状态到更加不同的状态的过渡，归因于自然选择的累积（容以后详论）作用，在某个确定的方向积累构造的差异。所以我认为显著的变种可以理直气壮地叫作初始物种；但是这种观点是否合理，必须根据本书所举出的各种事实和论点，通盘权衡，加以判断。

不必设想一切变种或初始物种都能达到物种的一级。它们也许会在初始状态中绝灭，或者长时期地停留在变种的阶段，如沃拉斯顿先生所指出的马德拉地方某些化石陆地贝类的变种便是这样。如果一个变种很繁盛，而超过了亲种的数目，那就会列为物种，而亲种就当作变种了；或者它会淘汰消灭亲种；或者两者并存，都排列为独立的物种。我们以后还要回来讨论这一问题。

从上述可以看出，我认为物种这个术语是为了便利而任意加于一群互相密切类似的个体的，它和变种这个术语在本质上并没有区别，变种是指区别较少而波动较多的类型。还有，变种这个名词和个体差异比较，也是为了便利而任意取用的。

在理论的指导下，我曾经想，将若干编著完备的植物志中的所有变种排列成表，对于变化最多的物种的性质和关系，也许能获得一些有趣的结果。乍看，这似乎是一件简单的工作；但是，不久沃森先生使我相信其中难点重重，我深深感谢他在这个问题上的宝贵忠告和帮助，以后胡克博士也这么说，甚至语气更重。这些难点和各变异物种的比例数目表，将留在将来的著作里再予讨论。胡克博士细读了我的原稿，检查了表格之后，他允许我补充说明，他认为下面的论述可以成立。然而，这里虽然讲得很简单，但整个问题是相当令人困惑的，并且不能不涉及“生存斗争”“性状的分歧”等问题，容以后讨论。

德康多尔等人阐明，分布很广的植物一般会出现变种；这在意料之中，因为暴露在不同的物理条件之下，还要和各类不同的生物进行竞争（以后将看到，这一点是更重要的条件）。但是我的表格进一步阐明，在任何有限制的地区里，越是普通的物种，即个体越多的物种，以及在自己的区域内分散越广的物种（这和分布广的意义不同，和普通也略有不同），往往发生特征足够显著的变种，记载在植物学著作中。因此，越是繁盛的物种，或者称为优势物种——它们分布最广，在本区域内分散最广，个体最多——就越产生显著的变种，或我所称的初始物种。这也许在预料之中，因为作为变种，要在任何程度上变成永久，必定要和该区域内的其他居住者进行斗争；已经占优势的物种，最有可能产生特定后代，虽然有轻微变异，还是继承了使亲种战胜同地生物的那些优点。

如果把任何植物志上记载的某地方生长的植物分作相等的两个群，把所有大属的植物放在一边，所有小属的植物放在另一边，则可发现大属那边很普通的、极分散的物种或优势物种略多。这也在预料之中，仅仅因为在任何地域内栖息着同属的许多物种，就表明该地有机、无机的条件里存在有利于该属的东西；结果，在大属里，即含有许多物种的属里，可望发现比例数目较多的优势物种。但是，可使这种结果暧昧不明的原因实在多，真奇怪我的表格甚至表明大属这一边略占多数。我在这里只提出两个暧昧的原因。淡水产喜盐的植物一般分布很广，且极分散，但这一点似乎和它们居住地方的性质有关，而和该物种所归的属之大小关系很少或没有关系。还有，体制低级的植物一般比高级的植物分散得更加广阔；而且这和属的大小也没有密切关联。体制低级的植物分布广的原因，将在“地理分布”一章讨论。

由于我把物种看作只是特性显著、定义明确的变种，所以预料各地大属的物种应比小属的物种更常出现变种；因为，无论哪里有许多密切近似物种（即同属的物种）形成，一般应有许多变种即初始物种正在形成。哪里有许多大树生长，哪里可望找到幼苗。哪里有属的许多物种因变异而形成，哪里的条件必有利于变异；因此，可望这些条件一般还会继续有利于变异。相反，我们如果把各个物种看作是特别创造出来的，就没有明显的理由来说明，为什么含有多数物种的类群比含有少数物种的类群会发生更多的变种。

为了测试这种预料的正确性，我把十二个地区的植物及两个地区的鞘翅类昆虫排列为差不多相等的两群，大属的物种排一边，小属的物种排另一边；结果毫无例外地证明了，大属一边比小属一边产生变种的物种比例更高。另外，产生任何变种的大属物种，一律比小属的物种所产生的变种平均更多。如果采用另一种分群方法，彻底排除表内只有一个到四个物种的最小属，这两个结果也一样。这些事实清楚地表明，物种仅是显著标记而永久的变种而已；无论哪里同属的物种大量形成，或者不妨说，哪里物种制造厂活动过，一般应该发现这些工厂仍在活动，特别是我们可以有充分的理由相信，新种的制造是一个缓慢的过程。如果把变种看作初始物种，上述这一点肯定属实；因为我的表格一般清楚地表明，无论哪里属的物种大量形成，这个属的物种产生的变种（即初始物种）就会在平均数以上。倒不是说所有大属现在变异都很大，因而都在增加物种数量，也不是说小属现在都不变异，不增加物种；否则我的学说就要受到灭顶之灾。地质学明白地告诉我们，小属随着时间的推移常常会大事增大；而大属常常已经达到顶点，而衰落消失。我们所要阐明的仅仅是，哪里有属的物种大量形成，一般说来就有许多物种还在形成；这可谓言之有理。

大属的物种和其中有记载的变种之间，有值得注意的其他关系。我们已经看到，辨别物种和显著变种并没有颠扑不破的标准；在存疑类型之间没有找到中间连锁的时候，学者就不得不依据它们之间的差异量来决定，用类推的方法来判断其差异量是否足够把一方或双方升到物种的等级。因此，差异量就成为解决两个类型究竟应该列为物种还是变种的极其重要的标准。弗里斯（Fries）曾就植物，韦斯特伍德（Westwood）曾就昆虫说明，大属里物种之间的差异量往往极小。我曾努力以平均数来测试这种情形，所得到的粗浅结果总是证实这种观点。我还询问过几位睿智的、经验丰富的观察者，他们三思之后也赞同这种意见。所以，在这方面，大属的物种比小属的物种更像变种。这种情形可换一种说法，也就是说，在大属里，超过平均数的变种即初始物种现在还在制造中，许多已经制造成的物种在某种程度上还是和变种相似，因为这些物种彼此的差异不及普通的差异量大。

而且，大属内物种的相互关系，同任何一个物种的变种是相似的。没有一位学者宣称，属内的全部物种在彼此区别上是相等的；一般地可以把它们区分为亚属、组（sections）或更小的类群。弗里斯说得好，小群物种一般就像卫星环绕在其他物种的周围。因此，所谓变种，还不是一群类型，它们的彼此关系不均等，环绕在某些类型——即环绕在其亲种的周围？变种和物种之间无疑存在着一个极重要的不同点，即变种彼此之间的差异量，或与其亲种的差异量，比起同属的物种之间要小得多。但是，当我们讨论到我称为“性状的分歧”的原则时，将会看到如何解释这一点，变种之间的小差异将倾向于增大为物种之间的大差异。

我看还有一点值得注意。变种的分布范围一般都十分有限；这话确是不讲自明的，如果发现一个变种比它的假定亲种有更广阔的分布范围，那就应该把名称倒转过来了。但是也有理由相信，同其他物种密切相似的并且类似变种的物种，常常有极有限的分布范围。例如，沃森先生曾把精选的《伦敦植物名录》（第四版）列为物种的63种植物指给我看，但他认为它们同其他物种太相似，所以价值存疑。根据沃森先生所做的英国区划，这63个所谓物种的分布范围平均为6.9区。在同一《名录》里，记载着53个公认的变种，分布范围为7.7区；而这些变种所属的物种的分布范围为14.3区。所以公认的变种和密切相似的类型具有几乎一样的有限平均分布范围，后者就是沃森先生指出的所谓存疑物种，但它们几乎普遍地被英国学者们列为货真价实的物种了。

最后，变种具有与物种相同的一般性状，无法和物种区别——除非，第一，发现了中间的连锁类型，而这种连锁的出现不能影响其所连接的类型的实际性状；第二，两者之间具有一定的差异量，因为两个类型如果差异很小，一般列为变种，虽然并没有发现中间的连锁类型，但是给予两个类型物种地位所需要的差异量，却是不确定的。在任何地方，含有超过平均数的物种的属，其中的物种也有超过平均数的变种。在大属里，物种易于密切但不均等地相互近似，环绕某些物种形成小群。与其他物种密切近似的物种显然具有有限的分布范围。在上述这些方面，大属的物种极类似于变种。如果物种曾经作为变种而生存过，并且是由变种产生的，我们便可以明白这种类似性；然而，如果各物种是独立创造的，这种类似性就完全不能解释了。

我们还看到，大属中越是繁盛的优势物种，平均变种越多；而我们以后将看到，变种倾向于变成新物种。因此大属倾向于变得更大；自然界中，现在占优势的生物类型由于留下了许多变异了的优势后代，倾向于更加占有优势。但是经过以后要说明的步骤，大属也有分裂为小属的倾向。这样，全世界的生物类型就在类群之下又分为类群了。





第三章　生存斗争


对自然选择的影响——该术语的广义——几何级数的增加——归化动植物的迅速增加——抑制增加的性质——竞争的普遍性——气候的影响——个体数目的保护——全体动植物在自然界的复杂关系——同种的个体和变种间生存斗争最剧烈；同属的物种间也往往剧烈——生物与生物的关系是一切关系中最重要的

进入本章的主题之前，必须先说几句开场白，表明生存斗争对于“自然选择”的影响。前一章已经谈到，自然状况下的生物是有个体变异的；这一点从未听说有争论。把一群存疑类型叫作物种、亚种或变种，对于我们无关紧要。例如，只要承认有显著变种存在，把英国植物中二三百个存疑类型列入哪一级都没有关系。但是，仅仅有个体变异和少数显著变种的存在，虽然为本书打基础是必要的，但很少能够帮我们理解物种在自然状况下是怎样发生的。体制的这一部分对于另一部分及其对于生活条件的一切巧妙适应，生物之间的一切巧妙适应，是怎样完善的呢？在啄木鸟和槲寄生身上，我们明显看到了这种美妙的相互适应；在依附兽毛、羽毛之上的最下等寄生物上，在潜水甲虫的构造上，在微风中飘荡的冠毛种子上，也差不多同样明显；简而言之，无论何地和生物界的每一部分，都能看到美妙的适应。

不妨再问一下，变种即我所谓的初始物种，最终怎样变成货真价实的物种了呢？在大多数情形下，物种间的差异，显然远远超过了同一物种的变种间的差异。那些组成所谓属的种群间的差异比同属物种间的差异为大，这些种群是怎样发生的呢？所有这些结果都不可避免地是从生存斗争中得来的，下一章将充分论述。由于生存斗争，变异无论多么轻微，无论由于什么原因发生，只要任何物种的个体在与其他生物、与自然界的无限复杂关系中多少从中得益，就会倾向于保存该个体，并且一般会让后代继承下来。后代也因此有了较好的生存机会，因为任何物种间歇性产生的许多个体，只有少数能够生存。我把保存每一个有用的微小变异的这一原则称为“自然选择”，表明它和人工选择力的关系。我们已经看到，人类利用选择，确能产生伟大的结果，并且通过累积自然之手所给予的微小而有用的变异，能使生物适合于自己的用途。但是我们以后将看到，自然选择是一种不断随时激活的力量，它无比地优越于微弱的人力。天工无限优于人工。

现在就生存斗争稍加详论。我以后的著作还要大事讨论这个问题，完全值得讨论。老德康多尔和赖尔已经富于哲理性地阐明了，一切生物都暴露在剧烈的竞争之中。关于植物，曼彻斯特区监督牧师赫伯特（W. Herbert）以无人能及的气魄和才华进行了讨论，显然来源于渊博的园艺学知识。口头上承认生存斗争的普遍性，是再容易不过的事情，但至少我认为，对这一结论要念念不忘却难上加难。然而，我认为，除非在思想上彻底体会这一点，否则我们对于包含着分布、稀少、繁盛、灭绝以及变异等各种事实的整个自然系统，就是认识模糊或完全误解。我们看见自然界的外貌喜气洋洋，我们常常看见食物过剩，却看不见或者忘却安闲地在周围唱歌的鸟，多数是以昆虫或种子为生的，因而经常性地在毁灭生命。我们会忘记这些鸣禽，它们的蛋或幼鸟，会被猛禽猛兽所大批毁灭。我们并非总是记得，食物虽然现在是过剩的，但并不见得每年的所有季节都是这样。

应当先设定，术语生存斗争采取广义的比喻义，包含生物的相互依存关系，更重要的，不仅仅是个体保命且成功留下后代。两只狗类动物在饥饿的时候，为了生存争食，可以说实实在在在互相搏斗。但是，生长在沙漠边缘的植物，可以说是在抗旱求生存，但适当地应该说，它是依存于潮气。一株植物，每年结一千粒种子，但平均只有一粒能成熟结籽，可以确切地说，它是在和覆被地面的同类和异类植物做斗争。槲寄生依存于苹果树和少数其他树木，但只能牵强附会地说它在和这些树木做斗争，一株树上这种寄生物过多会枯死。但是如果几株槲寄生苗密集地寄生在同一枝条上，就可以实实在在地说是在互相斗争。槲寄生是由鸟类散布的，所以生存便取决于鸟类；可以比喻地说，为了引诱鸟类来吞吃果实从而散布种子，就是在和其他结籽植物做斗争了。在这几种彼此交叉的意义中，我出于方便，采用了生存斗争这一通用术语。

所有生物都有高速增殖的倾向，生存斗争不可避免。各种生物在其自然寿命中都会产生若干卵或种子，在生命的某一时期，某一季节，或者某一年，必定要遭到毁灭，否则按照几何级数增加的原则，数量就会很快多得泛滥，没有地方能够容纳。因此，由于产生的个体比能生存的多，无论如何一定会发生生存斗争，或者同种个体之间，或者同异种的个体斗争，或者同外界的生活条件斗争。这是马尔萨斯学说成倍地应用于整个的动植物界；在这种情形下，既不能人为地增加食物，也不能谨慎地限制交配。虽然某些物种现在可以或快或慢地增加数目，但是所有的物种并不能这样，因为世界容纳不下它们。

毫无例外，各种生物都自然地高速增殖，如果不加以毁灭，一对生物的后代很快就会充满这个地球。即使生殖缓慢的人类，也在二十五年间增加了一倍，照此速率类推，几千年以后，后代就没有立足之地了。林奈（Linnaeus）计算过，如果一株一年生的植物只结两粒种子（生殖力这样低的植物是没有的），幼株翌年也只结两粒种子，这样下去，二十年后就会有一百万株了。大象在所有已知的动物中可谓是生殖最慢的，我曾费力去计算它在自然增殖方面最小的可能速率；可以保守地假定，它在三十岁开始生育，直到九十岁，在这期间共生三对小象；如果这样，五百年以后就会有一千五百万只象生存，都是第一对的后裔。

但是，这个问题除了理论计算外，还有更好的证据；大量记载事例表明，自然状况下的各种动物如遇环境连续两三季都适宜的话，便会神速增殖。还有更触目惊心的证据，来自世界若干地方已返归野生状态的许多种类的家畜：生育慢的马和牛在南美洲以及近年来在澳洲的增殖率记录，若非确有实据，实难以置信。植物也是这样，以外地移入的植物为例，不到十年时间，就布满了全岛。现在阿根廷拉普拉塔（La Plata）广大平原上最普通的若干种植物，原来是欧洲引进的，可以密布数里格（1里格＝3平方英里）的地面上，几乎排除了一切他种植物。还有，我听福尔克纳（Falconer）博士说，在美洲发现后从那里移入到印度的一些植物，已从科摩林角（Cape Comorin）分布到喜马拉雅了。这些例子真是不胜枚举。在这些个案中，没有人假定这些动植物的能育性突如其来暂时地明显增加了。解释不言而喻，生活条件是十分适宜的，结果，老幼动植物的毁灭减少了，几乎所有新生者都能生育。结果按几何级数增殖，令人瞠目结舌，这干脆地说明了归化动植物在新家为什么会神速增殖和广泛散布。

自然状况下，几乎每一植株都产生种子，而动物很少不是每年交配的。因此我们可以断定，一切动植物都有几何级数增殖的倾向，凡是能生存下去的地方，每一处都要迅速满员，而几何级数增加的倾向必须在生命某一时期加以毁灭抑制。我想，对大家畜熟门熟路，会把我们引入歧途，对大量毁灭视而不见，也就忘记了每年有成千上万家畜遭屠宰食用，而且在自然状况下好歹也得有相等的数目消灭掉。

生物有每年生产成千上万枚卵或种子的，也有只生产极少数卵或种子的，两者仅有的差别是，生殖慢的生物，在适宜的条件下需要稍稍长一些年限去布满整个地区，哪怕地方很大很大。神鹰（condor）产两三枚卵，鸵鸟（ostrich）产二三十个卵，然而在同一地区，神鹰可能为数更多；管鼻鹱（Fulmar petrel）只产一枚卵，但公认是世界上最多的鸟。一种蝇产卵成百上千，另一种蝇，如虱蝇（hippobosca）只产一枚卵；但生卵数量多少，并不能决定两个物种在一个地区内可以养活多少个体。所依赖的食物大起大落的物种，多产卵是较重要的，因为可以迅速增殖。但是大量产卵或种子的真正重要性，却在于补偿生命某一阶段的大量毁灭；大多数情况下这个阶段就是初始期。如果一头动物好歹能保护住卵或幼仔，少量生产仍然能充分保持平均数量；如果卵或幼仔遭到大量毁灭，就必须大量生产，否则物种就要灭绝，假如有一种树平均能活一千年，哪怕千年产一粒种，假定种子不毁，又能保证在适宜的地方萌发，这就足以保持这种树的数目了。所以在所有情况下，任何动植物，平均数目只间接地取决于卵或种子的数目。

观察大自然的时候，千万记住上述论点，千万不要忘记周围每一个生物可以说都在竭力增殖，每一种生物在生命的某一时期要靠斗争而生活；千万不要忘记在每一世代或者间隔几代，大毁灭不可避免地要降临幼者或老者。只要少许减轻抑制作用，只要缓和毁灭，物种的数量几乎立刻就会大事增加。大自然的面孔可以比作高产的表面，密密麻麻打入了万千尖利的楔子，不停地击打向内插，有时候击打一根楔子，然后加大力气击打另一根。

各个物种有增殖的自然倾向，其抑制因素极其含糊。看一看最生机勃勃的物种，其数量越是密密匝匝，进一步增殖的倾向也越强。抑制增殖的因素究竟是什么，我们连一个事例也弄不明白。这也不足为怪，只要想一想，我们在这方面是何等无知，哪怕对于远比任何其他动物更了解的人类也是如此。这一主题已有若干作者高论过了，我期望将来在自己的著作里详论抑制增殖的因素，特别是对于南美洲的野生动物。这里我只稍微谈一谈，让读者注意几个要点。卵或幼小动物一般看起来受害最多，但不能一概而论。植物的种子被毁的极多，但从我所做的某些观察得知，在已布满他种植物的土地上发芽时，幼苗受害最多。幼苗还会被各种敌害大量毁灭。例如，有一块三英尺长二英尺宽的土地，翻耕除草后，不会再受其他植物的抑制，土著杂草出秧时，我在所有幼苗上做了记号，357株中，不下295株毁灭了，主要是蛞蝓、昆虫吃掉了。在长期修剪的草皮，四脚兽细嚼慢咽过的草皮也一样，如果让草任意生长，强壮的植物会逐渐灭掉不强的，哪怕后者已经长大。例如在一小块草皮（三英尺乘四英尺）上生长着二十个物种，其中九个物种由于其他物种的自由生长而死亡了。

每个物种所能吃到的食物数量，当然为各物种的增殖划了极限；但决定一个物种的平均数量，往往不在于获得食物，而在于他种动物的捕食。例如，似乎很少有人怀疑，任何大庄园的鹧鸪、松鸡、野兔的数量主要决定于有害兽的消灭。如果今后二十年中英格兰不射杀一个猎物，同时也不消灭有害兽，那么猎物很有可能比现在还要来得少，虽然现在每年要射杀百十万只。相反，在某些情形下，例如象和河马，是不会被食肉兽捕杀的；在印度甚至老虎也极少敢于攻击母象保护下的小象。

决定物种的平均数量，气候至关重要，我认为极端寒冷或干旱季节的不时出现，是最有效的抑制因素。我估算过，1854—1855年冬季，我的居住地消灭的鸟类达五分之四；这真是重大的毁灭，我们知道，如果人类因传染病而死去百分之十，便是惨重的死亡率了。气候的作用乍看似乎同生存斗争无关，而由于气候的主要作用在于减少食物，便引发了同种、异种的个体间最激烈的斗争，因为它们靠同样食物生存。哪怕是气候，例如严寒直接发生作用时，受害最大的还是最不健壮的个体，或者入冬后获得食物最少的个体。我们从南往北走，或从湿润地区到干燥地区，必定会看出某些物种渐次稀少，最后绝迹。气候变化显而易见，我们不免把这整个的效果归因于它的直接作用。但这种见解大错特错了，我们忘记了，各个物种即使在其最繁盛的地方，也经常在生命的某一时期由于敌害或同一地方同一食物的竞争者而大量毁灭。只要气候有轻微变化而稍有利于这些敌害或竞争者，它们便会增殖；由于各个地区都已布满了生物，其他物种便要减少。我们向南走，如果看见某一物种数量越来越少，就可以断定，其原因可以是别的物种受了益，也可以是这个物种受了损。向北走的情形也是这样，不过程度稍轻，因为各类的物种数量向北去都在减少，所以竞争者也减少了；因此向北走或登山时，往往就比向南走或下山时见到的植物矮小，这是由于气候的直接有害作用所致。我们到达北极区、积雪的山顶、纯粹的沙漠时，生物几乎单单是同自然环境进行生存斗争了。

花园里巨大数量的植物完全能够忍受我们的气候，但是永远不能归化，因为无法和土著植物进行斗争，也不能抵抗土著动物的侵害。显而易见，气候主要是间接起作用，有利于其他物种。

如果一个物种由于高度适宜的环境条件在一个小地域内过分增殖了，常常会引起传染病的发生，至少我们的猎物一般是如此。这里的限制性抑制因素同生存斗争不相干。但是，甚至有些所谓传染病似乎是由寄生虫所致，由于某原因，部分地可能是由于动物拥挤易于传播，寄生虫不对称地受益，这里就发生了某种寄生物和寄主间的斗争。

另一方面，在许多情形下，面对敌害，同种个体绝对需要大数量才能保存。例如，我们能轻易地在田间种植大量的五谷和油菜籽等等，因为种子和以此为食的鸟类数量相比，大为过剩，鸟在这一季里虽然食物异常丰富，却不能按照种子供给的比例增殖，其数量在冬季受抑制。人们一试便知，要想从花园里的少量小麦这类植物获得种子是多么麻烦；我就曾颗粒无收。同种的大群个体对于自身保存是必要的，这一观点，我相信可以解释自然界某些奇特的事实，例如极稀少的植物有时会在所生存的少数地方长得极其繁盛；某些丛生性植物，甚至在分布范围的边缘还能丛生，这就是说，个体是繁盛的。在这种情形下，可以相信，只有在许多个体能够共存的有利生活条件下，一种植物才能生存，这样才能抱团互助，免于全部覆灭。我还要补充一句，频繁杂交的优良效果，近亲交配的不良效果，也许在这些个案中起了作用；不过这一问题太复杂，这里不预备详述。

记载下来的很多个案表明，在同一地方势必进行斗争的生物之间的抑制因素和相互关系，是何等的复杂和出人意料。我只准备举一个例子，虽然简单，但我感兴趣。我亲戚在斯塔福德郡（Staffordshire）有一庄园，我在那里可以进行大量的调查。那里有一大片极度荒芜的荒地，从来没有耕种过；但有数百英亩性质完全一致的土地，曾在二十五年前圈了起来，种上了欧洲赤松（Scotch fir）。荒地种植部分的土著植物群落发生了极显著的变化，远非两片不同的土壤上可以见到的一般变化程度可比：不但荒地植物的比例数完全改变了，且有十二个植物种（不算禾本草类及苔草类）在种植园内繁生，而它们根本不见于荒地。对于昆虫的影响想必更大些，有六种不见于荒地的食虫鸟，在种植园内很普遍；而经常光顾荒地的却是两三种食虫鸟。这里我们看到，只是引进一种树便会发生多么大的影响，当时除了把土地圈起来防止牛踏进去之外，什么也没有做。但是，圈地这种要素的重要性，我曾在萨里郡（Surrey）的费勒姆（Farnham）邻近地方清楚地看到了。那里有广袤的荒地，远处小山顶上生长着几片老龄欧洲赤松。最近十年内，大块地方已圈地了，于是自然播种的赤松树层出不穷，密密麻麻挤着，无法全部存活。当我确定这些幼树并非人工播种或移植，对于它们的数量之多大感惊异，于是去了数处观测点，观察了未圈地的数百英亩荒地，除了旧时种植的几丛外，简直看不到一株欧洲赤松。但在荒地灌木的茎干之间细察时，我发现了许多幼苗和小树不时被牛吃掉了尖头。离一片老树百把码地方，一平方码的地上，共计有三十二株小树；其中一株，有二十六圈年轮，看来多年来曾试图把树顶伸出荒地灌木的树干之上，但没有成功。难怪一经圈地，便有生气勃勃的幼龄松树密布在土地上面了。可是这片荒地曾经极端荒芜而且辽阔，没有人会想象到牛竟能这样细密地来觅食，而且颇有斩获。

由此可见，牛绝对决定着欧洲赤松的生存；但在若干地区，昆虫决定着牛的生存。大概巴拉圭在这方面有最奇异的事例；那里从来没有牛马或狗变成野生，但南来北往都有这些动物在野生状态下成群行动；亚莎拉（Azara）和伦格（Rengger）阐明，这是由于巴拉圭的某种蝇过多所致，这种蝇就在初生幼畜的脐中产卵。此蝇虽多，但其增殖想必常遇到某种抑制，大概是鸟类吧。因此，如果巴拉圭某种食虫鸟（其数量大概受老鹰或猛兽调节）增多了，蝇就要减少——于是牛马便可能成为野生的了，而这一定会使植物群落大为改变（我确在南美洲一些地方看到过这种现象）；同时这又会大大地影响昆虫；从而又会影响食虫鸟，恰如我们在斯塔福德郡所见，如此循环往复，复杂关系不断扩大。这个系列从食虫鸟始，又以食虫鸟终。倒不是自然界里的各种关系都可以这样简单。战斗之中套着战斗，必定反复发生，成败无常；尽管区区琐事往往能使一种生物战胜另一种生物，然而从长远看，各种势力是微妙平衡的，自然界可以长期保持划一的面貌。然而我们是多么无知，又是多么自说自话，一听到一种生物的灭绝就大惊小怪；又不知道其原因，就提出毁灭世界的灾变说，或者创造出一些法则来规定生物类型的寿命！

我想再举一个事例，说明自然界等级中相距甚远的动植物如何被复杂的关系网联结在一起。以后还有机会阐明，英格兰这个地区的外来植物亮毛半边莲（Lobelia fulgens）从来没有昆虫光顾，结果由于它的特殊构造，从不结籽。许多兰科植物都绝对需要蛾子的光顾，带走花粉块，从而使其受精。我还有理由相信，大黄蜂是三色堇（Viola tricolor）受精所不可缺少的，因为别的蜂类都不来光顾这种花。我从试验里发现，蜂类的光顾对于三叶草（clover）受精，哪怕不是不可或缺，也至少是高度有益。而只有大黄蜂才光顾红三叶草（苜蓿Trifolium pratense），因为别的蜂类都不能接触到它的花蜜。因此，我不怀疑，如果英格兰的整个大黄蜂属都灭绝了或变得稀少，三色堇和红三叶草也会变得稀少，或全部消失。任何地方的大黄蜂数量大都是由鼠的多少来决定的，田鼠毁灭蜂房蜂群。纽曼（H. Newman）先生长期研究过大黄蜂的习性，认为“全英格兰三分之二以上的大黄蜂都是这样消灭的”。众所周知，鼠的数量大多取决于猫的数量；纽曼先生说：“在村庄和小镇的附近，我看见大黄蜂窝比别的地方多，我把这一点归因于有大量的猫在捕鼠的缘故。”因此可以相信，一处地方有大量的猫科动物，先干预鼠，再干预蜂，就可以决定该地区内某些花的多少！

针对每一个物种，在不同的生命时期、不同的季节和年份，有多种不同的抑制因素会出现，对其发生作用；其中某一种或者某少数几种抑制作用一般最有力量，但在决定物种的平均数，乃至它的生存上，则需要共同发挥作用。有时候可以阐明，同一物种在不同地区所受到的抑制作用大相径庭。当我们看到纠缠在岸边的植物和灌木时，易于把它们的比例数和种类归因于所谓的偶然机会。但这是大错特错的！谁都听说过，美洲森林砍伐以后，便有很不同的植物群落生长起来；但已经有人谈到，美国南方的印第安古冢上现在生长的树木同周围的处女林相似，呈现了同样美丽的多样性和同样比例的各类植物。千百年来，在每年各自成千上万散播种子的若干树类之间，想必进行了十分激烈的斗争；昆虫和昆虫之间——昆虫、蜗牛等动物与猛禽、猛兽之间——进行了何等战争啊，它们都努力增殖，彼此相食，或者吃树、吃树的种子和幼苗，或者吃最初密布于地面而抑制这些树木生长的其他植物！将一把羽毛抛出，都必须依照一定的法则落到地面上；但是这个问题比起无数动植物之间的关系，就显得非常简单了，动植物的作用和反作用在千百年里决定了现今生长在印第安废墟上各类树木的比例数和树木的种类！

生物彼此的依存关系，有如寄生物之于寄主，一般是在性状级别远的生物之间发生的。严格意义上，彼此进行着生存斗争的生物往往如此，例如飞蝗类和食草兽。不过同种个体之间的斗争几乎都是你死我活的，因为住同一区域，需要同样的食物，还遭遇同样的危险。同种的变种之间的斗争一般差不多是同等剧烈的，而且我们有时看到争夺很快就见分晓。例如几个小麦变种混播，然后把混杂的种子再播种，那些最适于土壤气候的，或者天生最能育的变种，便会打败别的变种，结籽更多，几年之后就会将其淘汰。哪怕极度相近的变种，如颜色不同的香豌豆，混合种植时，必须每年分别采收种子，播种时再照适当的比例混合，否则弱种类的数量会不断减少而终于消灭。绵羊的变种也是这样：有人断言，某些山地绵羊变种能使另外一些变种饿死，所以不能混养。不同变种的医用蛭混养，结果也这样。让任何一种家养植物或家畜的一些变种，像在自然状况下那样相互进行斗争，假如不每年选种或拣选幼畜，那么甚至可以怀疑这些变种有没有一模一样的体力、习性和体质，足以让一个混合群的原始比例维持六代之久。

由于同属的物种通常在习性和体质方面是相似的，并且在构造方面总是相似（虽然不是绝对如此），所以之间如发生竞争，斗争一般要比异属的物种之间更剧烈。近来有一种燕子在美国局部地区拓展了，致使另一种燕子减量，可见这一点不谬。近来苏格兰一些地方槲鸫（missel-thrush）增量，导致歌鸫（song-thrush）的减量。我们不是每每听说，在千差万别的气候下一个鼠种代替了另一鼠种！在俄罗斯，小型的亚洲种蟑螂（Asiatic cockroach）入境之后，赶着大型蟑螂到处跑。一种田芥菜（charlock）将淘汰另一种，如此种种，不一而足。我们能够隐约看到，大自然系统中填补近乎相同地位的近似类型之间的竞争为什么最为剧烈；但我们大概怎么也说不确切，在伟大的生存斗争中一个物种为什么战胜了另一个物种。

从上述可以演绎出高度重要的结论，即每一种生物的构造，以最基本然而往往是隐蔽的方式和一切其他生物的构造相关联，竞争食物或住所，要么被迫躲避它们，要么捕杀它们。在虎牙虎爪的构造上这一点很明显，攀附在虎毛上的寄生虫的腿和爪的构造也这样。但是蒲公英美丽的羽毛种子和水生甲虫扁平而生有排毛的腿，乍看似乎仅仅和空气和水有关系，但羽毛种子的优点，无疑在于和密布他种植物的地面最密切相关；这样，种子才能广泛散布，落在空地上。水生甲虫的腿的构造，非常适于潜水，以便和其他水栖昆虫竞争，捕食食物，并逃避被捕食。

许多植物种子里贮藏养料，乍看似乎和其他植物没有任何关系。但是这样的种子（例如豌豆和蚕豆）播种在大草中间时，萌发的幼小植株就能茁壮生长，由此可以推知，种子中养料的主要用途是有利于幼苗生长，以便和四周繁茂的其他植物作斗争。

看一看生长在分布范围中央的植物吧，为什么其数量没有翻一番、翻两番呢？我们知道它对于稍热或稍冷，稍潮湿或稍干燥的环境都能完全抵御，因为它能分布到稍热稍冷、稍湿稍干的其他地区。在此可以清楚看出，如果我们指望这种植物有能力增殖，就必须使它对竞争者、对于吃它的动物占些优势。在它的地理分布范围边缘，如果体质针对气候而发生变化，这显然有利于该植物；但有理由相信，只有少数的动植物能分布到仅仅严酷的气候就可加以消灭的远方。除非到达生活范围的极限，如北极地方或荒漠的边缘，竞争是不会停止的。有些地面可能极冷、极干，然而仍有少数几个物种或同种的个体之间为着争取最暖湿的地点而进行斗争。

由此可见，当一种动植物放置在新的地方而处于新的竞争者之中时，虽然气候可能和原产地一模一样，但生活条件一般已发生了质变。如果要它在新地方增加平均数，就得放弃在其原产地的做法，而使用不同的方法来改变它；必须使它对一批不同的竞争者和敌害占些优势。

因此，我们不妨去设想使任何类型对其他类型占有优势。也许事到临头，我们根本不知道应该如何下手才能如愿以偿。这使我们确信，我们对于一切生物之间的相互关系实在无知；此种信念似乎难以获得，所以是必要的。我们所能做到的，就是牢牢记住，每一种生物都努力按照几何级数增殖；每一种都在生命的某一时期，一年中的某一季节，每一世代或隔代，必须进行生存斗争，并且遭受大量毁灭。想到这种斗争，我们可以安慰自己，坚信自然界的战争不是无休无止的，恐惧是感觉不到的，死亡一般是瞬间发生的，而强壮的、健康的和幸运的个体则生存并繁殖下去。





第四章　自然选择


自然选择——其力量和人工选择的比较——对于不重要性状的力量——对于各年龄和雌雄两性的力量——性选择——论同种个体间杂交的普遍性——对自然选择有利和不利的条件，即杂交、隔离、个体数目——作用缓慢——自然选择所引起的灭绝——性状的分歧，与任何小地区生物多样性的关联以及与归化的关联——自然选择，通过性状的分歧和灭绝，对于共同祖先的后代的作用——解释一切生物分类

上一章一笔带过的生存斗争，究竟如何对变异发生作用的呢？人类手里证明是威力巨大的选择原则，在自然界适用吗？我想我们将会看到，它是能够极其有效地发生作用的。请记住，家养生物有无数奇特变异，尽管自然状况下变异程度差一些；而且遗传倾向如此强烈。在家养状况下，可以说生物的整个体制好歹呈现可塑性了。请记住，一切生物的相互关系及其对于生活的物理条件的关系是何等复杂而密切。既然对于人类有用的变异毫无疑问地发生过，那在广大而复杂的生存斗争中，对于各个生物好歹有用的其他变异，难道在连续的成千上万世代中就判定不可能偶尔发生吗？如果确能发生，那么我们能怀疑（必须记住产生的个体超过可能生存的个体）较其他个体具有任何优越性（即使微不足道）的个体具有最好的生存和繁育后代的机会吗？相反，我们可以确定，任何有害的变异，即使微不足道，也会遭到严格消灭。我把这种有利变异的保存和有害变异的毁灭，叫作“自然选择”。无用也无害的变异则不受自然选择的影响，留作彷徨变异要素，如我们在所谓多态种里所看到的。

以经历某些物理变化如气候变化的一个地方为例，就可以深入理解自然选择的大致过程。当地生物比例数几乎即刻就发生变化，有些物种会灭绝。从我们所知道的各地生物密切而复杂的关系来看，可以得出结论，即使撇开气候变化不谈，某些生物的比例数发生任何变化，也会严重影响许多其他生物。如果该地区的边界是开放的，则新类型势必要迁移进去，这也会严重扰乱某些原有生物间的关系。请记住，引进一种树木或哺乳动物的影响，已经证明是何等有力。但是，对于一个岛，或障碍物部分环绕的地方，如果善于适应的新类型不能自由移入，则自然结构中就会腾出一些地位，这时如果某些原有生物好歹发生了改变，肯定会更好地加以填充；因为如果那区域允许自由移入，则外来生物早就占领那里的地位了。在这种孤岛，茫茫岁月机缘凑巧，凡有轻微的变异多少对任何物种的个体有利，使之更好地适应多变的外界条件，就有保存下来的倾向；于是，自然选择在改进生物上就有余地了。

正如第一章所阐明的，我们有理由相信，生活条件的变化通过特别影响生殖系统的作用而引起或者增加变异性；上述的个案中，假定外界条件已变，改善了有利变异发生的机会，这对自然选择显然大大有利；不发生有利变异，自然选择便无能为力。依我看，倒不需要极端数量的变异性，人类当然可以把细小的个体差异按照任何既定的方向积累起来，产生巨大的结果，自然也做得到，而且容易得多，它有无比长久的时间可以支配嘛。我也不认为真的需要任何巨大的物理变化，例如气候的变化，不需要异乎寻常的隔离以阻碍移入，来腾出新的空位，让自然选择改进某些变异着的生物，填充进去。由于各地区的全部生物都以微妙平衡的力量斗争在一起，一个物种的构造或习性发生极细微的变异，往往会因此占优势；同样的变异进一步发展，往往会使其优势进一步扩大。还没有一个地方，所有的土著生物现已完全相互适应，而且对于生活的物理条件也完全适应，以致其中没有一种能够少许改进。因为在一切地方，本地生物往往被归化生物压得抬不起头，最终听任外来者牢牢占据全境。外来生物既能这样在各地战胜某些本地生物，我们就可以稳妥地下结论：本地生物也可能已经发生有利的变异，以便更好地抵抗这种侵入者。

人类用按部就班而无意识的选择手段，能够产生出，而且确已产生了伟大的结果，那么大自然何所不能呢？人类只能作用于外在的可见性状，而大自然并不关心外貌，除非外貌对于生物是有用的。自然能对各种内部器官、各种微细的体质差异以及整个生命机器发生作用。人类只为自己的利益而进行选择，自然则只为她所照拂的生物的利益而进行选择。各种被选择的性状，都充分地受着自然的锻炼，而生物被置于合适的生活条件之下。人类把多种生长在不同气候下的生物养在同一处；很少用某种特有的适宜方法来锻炼各个被选择的性状；用同样的食物饲养长喙和短喙的鸽；不用特有的方法去训练长背的或长腿的四足兽；把长毛的和短毛的绵羊养在同一种气候里。人类不允许最强壮的雄性为占有雌性而斗争；并不严格地把所有劣质动物都消灭掉，而是在力所能及的范围内，在各个不同季节里良莠不分，保护所有生物。人类往往以某半畸形的类型开始选择；或者至少以足够引起自己注意的某显著变异，明显对自己有用的变异，才开始选择。在自然界，构造上或体质上的极微细差异，便能打破生活斗争的微妙平衡，得以保存下来。人类是多么反复无常，朝三暮四啊！寿命又是何等短暂啊！因而，与大自然在整个地质时代的累积结果相比较，人类所得的结果是何等贫乏啊！所以，大自然的产物远比人类的产物在性状上更“真”，更无限地适应极其复杂的生活条件，并且明显地标有更高级技巧的烙印，这又有什么值得大惊小怪的呢？

可以说，自然选择在世界各地，每日每时都在仔细检查着每一个变异，哪怕其微细无比，并且去芜存菁，加以积累；无论何时何地，只要有机会，就不声不响、不知不觉地进行工作，针对有机的和无机的生活条件改良各种生物。这种缓慢变化的进行，我们一无所知，直到时间之手标出时代的长久流逝。而我们对于早已过去的地质时代所知有限，能看出的充其量也只是现在的生物类型和先前的并不相同罢了。

虽然自然选择只能通过各个生物而发生作用，并且要符合各个生物的利益，然而对于我们往往认为微不足道的性状和构造，也可以这样发生作用。我们看见吃叶子的昆虫是绿色的，吃树皮的昆虫是斑灰色的；高山雷鸟（alpine ptarmigan）在冬季呈白色，而苏格兰雷鸟（red-grouse）是石南花颜色的，黑琴鸡（black-grouse）是泥灰色的，就必须相信这种颜色对这些鸟和昆虫有用是为了保身避险。松鸡（grouse）如果不在一生的某一时期被杀死，必然会增殖到无数；我们知道它们主要受猛禽的侵害；鹰依靠目力捕猎——问题严重到欧洲大陆某些地方的人被告诫不养白鸽子，因其极易受害。因此，没有理由怀疑，自然选择非常有效地给予各种松鸡以适当的颜色，并且让颜色在获得之后纯正而稳定地保存下来。我们不要以为，偶然除掉一只任何颜色的动物所产生的作用很小；应当记住，在白色绵羊群里，除掉一只略见黑色的羔羊是何等重要。至于植物，植物学者们把果实的茸毛和果肉的颜色看作是微不足道的性状，然而优秀的园艺家唐宁（Downing）说过，在美国，梅锥象甲（curculio）对光皮果实的危害远甚于茸毛果实；某种疾病对紫色梅的危害远甚于黄色梅；而黄色果肉的桃比别种果肉颜色的桃更易染上某种病害。如果广泛借助人工方法就使若干变种在栽培时见微知著，那么，在大自然里，果树势必同其他树木和大量敌害作斗争，这种差异肯定会一锤定音，哪一变种得以千秋万代——光果皮还是毛果皮，黄果肉还是紫果肉。

观察物种间的许多细小差异（以我们的一管之见，这些差异无关紧要），我们不可忘记气候、食物等等也许能产生某种微小的直接效果。然而，更有必要记住，存在着众多不为人知的相关生长定律，如果一部分发生变异，并且变异有利于生物通过自然选择而累积起来，其他变异将会随之发生，并且常常具有意料不到的性质。

我们知道，在家养状况下，在生命的任何期间出现的那些变异，后代往往于相同期间重现。例如，蔬菜和农作物许多变种的种子，家蚕变种的幼虫期和蛹期，鸡蛋和雏鸡的绒毛颜色，绵羊和牛快成年时的角。同样，在自然状况下，自然选择也能在任何年龄时期激活，对生物发生作用，并使其改变，只需把这一时期的有利变异累积起来，并在相应年龄时期加以遗传。如果植物得益于种子吹送得越来越远，那么依我看通过自然选择就可轻易实现，难度不会大于植棉者用选择的方法来增长和改进棉桃内的棉绒。自然选择能使昆虫的幼虫发生变异，以便适应跟成虫所遇大相径庭的许多不测。通过相关生长定律，这些变异无疑可以影响到成虫的构造。对于寿命只有几小时、一辈子不进食的昆虫，也许其大部分构造仅仅是幼虫构造连续改变的关联物。反过来也是这样，成虫的变异可能也常常影响幼虫的构造；但在所有情况下，自然选择将保证因生命的其他时期变异而派生的变异一定不能丝毫有害，因为如果有害，物种就要灭绝了。

自然选择能使子体的构造根据亲体发生变异，也能使亲体的构造根据子体发生变异。在社会性动物里，自然选择能使各个体的构造适应群体的利益，如果各自最终得益于所选的变异。自然选择所不能做的是，改变一个物种的构造，而不给它一点好处，却是为了另一物种的利益。虽然博物学著作中找到过这种说法，但我还没有拿到过一个经得起调查的个案。动物毕生仅用过一次的构造，如果是极重要的，那么自然选择就能使之发生任何程度的变异。例如某些昆虫专门用以破茧的大颚，或者孵化的雏鸟用以啄破蛋壳的坚硬喙端等皆是。有人断言，最好的短嘴翻飞鸽死在蛋壳里的比能够破壳而出的要多，所以养鸽者在孵化时要给予协助。再说，大自然若是为了鸽子自身的利益，不得不使成年鸽子生有极短的嘴，变异过程就是极缓慢的，同时蛋内的雏鸽要受到严格选择，就要那些具有最坚硬鸽喙的雏鸽，所有弱喙的雏鸽必死无疑；或者，选择脆弱易破的蛋壳，我们知道，蛋壳的厚度也像其他各种构造一样是变异的。




性选择。——鉴于在家养状况下，有些特性常常只见于一性，而且只遗传给同性，自然状况下大概也是如此，那么，自然选择能够改变一性对异性的功能关系，或者涉及两性完全不同的生活习性，昆虫有时就是这样。为此对于我称为“性选择”的概念要说明一下。这并不取决于生存斗争，而取决于雄性之间为了占有雌性而做的斗争。其结果并不是竞争失败者死，而是少留或者不留后代。所以性选择不如自然选择来得剧烈。一般来说，最强壮的雄性，最适于其在自然界中的位置，留下的后代也最多。但在许多情况下，胜利并不靠精力旺盛，而是靠雄性独有的特种武器。无角的雄鹿或无距的公鸡鲜有机会留下后代。性选择总是允许胜利者繁殖，确能激发不屈不挠的勇气，增加距铁的长度、翅膀拍击距脚的力量，它不亚于残酷的斗鸡者，总是知道把最会斗的公鸡仔细选择下来，以便改良品种。这种战斗定律在自然界中下降到哪一等级，我不知道；有人描述雄性鳄鱼（alligators）要占有雌性的时候，诉诸打斗、吼叫、打转，就像印第安人的战争舞蹈一样；有人观察雄性鲑鱼（salmons）整日在战斗；雄性锹形虫（stag-beetles）常常带着同性用巨型大颚咬伤的伤痕。多妻动物的雄性之间的战争大概最为剧烈，似乎总是生有特种武器。雄性食肉动物本已武装精良；但它们和别的动物，通过性选择的途径还可以生出特别的防御武器来，如狮子的鬃毛、野猪的垫肩和雄性鲑鱼的钩曲颚；为了取胜，盾和矛一样重要。

在鸟类中间，斗争的性质常常比较平和。所有关注此问题的人都认为，许多种类的雄鸟之间最剧烈的竞争是用歌喉引诱雌鸟。圭亚那的矶鸫（rock-thrush）、极乐鸟（birds of paradise）等等鸟类，聚集在一处，雄鸟依次展开美丽的羽毛，还在雌鸟面前做出奇怪滑稽的动作，而雌鸟作为观众站在一边，最后选择最有吸引力的配偶。密切观察过笼中鸟的人们都知道，鸟儿往往怀有个体的好恶，例如赫伦爵士（R. Heron）描述过一只杂色孔雀（pied peacock）鹤立鸡群，吸引了全部雌孔雀。将任何效果都归因于这种貌似无力的手段，未免显得幼稚可笑，这里无法讨论支持这种观点所必要的细节。但是，既然人类能在短时期内，依照自己的审美标准，使矮脚鸡获得美丽优雅的姿态，我实在没有充分的理由来怀疑雌鸟依照其审美标准，在成千上万的世代中，选择鸣声最好的或开屏最美的雄鸟，由此而产生了显著的效果。我强烈猜疑，关于雄鸟和雌鸟的羽毛不同于雏鸟的某些著名定律，可用性选择对于进入育龄或者交配季节的鸟类起作用，主要改变羽毛的观点来做解释；并且这种变异在相应的年龄或者季节要么单独遗传给雄性，要么两性均遗传。但这里没有篇幅来讨论这个问题了。

就这样，任何动物的雌雄两者如果具有相同的一般生活习性，但在构造、颜色或装饰上有所不同，我认为，这种差异主要是由性选择所引起；就是说，雄性个体在连续世代中在武器、防御手段或者魅力方面，比别的雄性略占优势，而这些优越性状又遗传给了雄性后代。然而，我不愿把所有这种性别差异都归因于这种动因，因为家养动物身上看到有一些特性出现并为雄性所专有（例如雄信鸽的垂肉、某些雄家禽的角状瘤，等等），不能认为这些特性有利于战斗或者吸引异性。自然状况下也有类似的个案，例如野生雄火鸡（turkey-cock）胸前的毛丛，既没有任何用处，也没有装饰性；——其实，假如在家养状况下出现此种毛丛，是会称为畸形的。




自然选择作用的事例。——为了弄清自然选择如何起作用，请允许我举出一两个虚拟事例。以狼为例，捕食动物为生，有些是智取，有些是强攻，也有些是捷足先登。我们假设：最敏捷的猎物，例如鹿，由于那个地区的变迁而增殖了，或者在狼最缺粮的季节里，其他猎物减少了数量。在这样的情况下，我看不出有任何理由可以怀疑，只有最敏捷最苗条的狼才有最好的生存机会，因而被保存或被选择下来，——只要在这个或那个不得不捕食其他动物的季节里，仍能保持制服猎物的力量就行。这就像人类通过仔细的按部就班选择，或者通过无意识的选择（人人试图保存最优良的狗但根本没有想到改变这个品种），就能够改进长驱跑狗的敏捷性是一样的不容置疑。

即使狼所捕食的动物不改变比例数，也有可能生下天性喜欢抓某种猎物的崽子。而且这种可能性还不小，我们常常看到家畜的天性千差万别。例如，一只猫喜欢逮大鼠，另一只喜欢逮家鼠。圣约翰先生说，有一只猫逮飞禽回家，另一只逮兔子回家，还有一只去沼泽地捕食，几乎天天晚上抓回来丘鹬啊，半蹼鹬什么的。众所周知，喜欢大鼠不喜欢家鼠的倾向可以遗传。假如习性、构造出现轻微的内在变化，有利于一头狼个体，它就最有机会生存并留下后代。某些狼崽子也许能继承同样的习性、构造，如此循环往复，可形成新变种，淘汰亲代类型，或者与之和平共处。再说，山区的狼群和低地的狼群自然被迫捕猎不同的动物，持续保存最适合两处的个体，可能缓慢地形成两个变体。变体相遇会杂交混合，不过杂交的题目下文再谈。我补充一下，据皮尔斯（Pierce）先生说，美国的卡茨基尔山（Catskill Mountains）栖息着狼的两个变种，一种类型追捕鹿群，像轻快的长驱跑狗那样；另一种身体庞大，腿短，常常袭击牧人的羊群。

下面举一个复杂的个案。有些植物分泌甜液，分明是为了从体液里排除有害的物质。例如，某些豆科（Leguminosae）植物托叶基部的腺就分泌这种汁液，月桂树（laurel）叶背上的腺也是。这种甜液分量虽少，却让昆虫孜孜以求。现在让我们假设，花瓣从其基部分泌一点点甜汁液即花蜜。这样，寻找花蜜的昆虫就会沾上花粉，当然常常把它从这一朵花带到另一朵的柱头上去。同种植物的两个不同个体的花因此而杂交；我们有理由相信（容后详述），这种杂交动作能够产生强壮的幼苗，因此得到繁盛和生存的最好机会。某些幼苗也许会继承分泌花蜜的能力。凡是个体的花具有最大的腺体即蜜腺，分泌最多的蜜汁，也就会最常受到昆虫的光顾，并且最常进行杂交；长此以往，它就占上风。如果花的雄蕊和雌蕊的位置同前来光顾的那种昆虫的身体大小和习性相适合，而好歹有利于花粉的输送，那么这种花也同样会得到青睐或者选择。不妨用不是吸取花蜜而是采集花粉而往来花间的昆虫为例：花粉形成的唯一目的是为了授精，所以毁坏它对于植物来说显然是纯粹的损失；然而如果有少许花粉被吃花粉的昆虫从这朵花带到那朵花去，最初是偶然的，后来成为惯常，因此而达到杂交，虽然十分之九的花粉毁坏了，但对于植物还是大有益处的，于是那些产生越来越多花粉、具有越来越大花粉囊的个体就会被选择下来。

长久保护或者自然选择越来越有吸引力的花朵，植物通过这种过程，就变得能够高度吸引昆虫，昆虫便会在无意中定期在花与花之间传带花粉；而且昆虫这样做非常有效，我能随便举出许多触目惊心的事例，阐明这一点。我只举一个例子，不是什么突出的个案，但同样可以说明后文将讨论的植物雌雄分化的一个步骤。有些冬青树（holly-tree）只生雄花，有四枚雄蕊只产生很少量的花粉，同时还有一个发育不全的雌蕊；有些冬青树只生雌花，具有充分大小的雌蕊，但四枚雄蕊上的花粉囊都萎缩了，找不出一粒花粉。在距离一株雄树刚刚六十码远的地方，我找到一株雌树，从不同的枝条上采选了二十朵花，柱头放在显微镜下观察，没有例外，所有柱头都有花粉，而且几个柱头有大量花粉。几天以来，风都是从雌树吹向雄树，花粉不可能由风传带过来。天气很冷且风暴雨狂，所以对于蜂是不利的。不过，我检查过的每一朵雌花，都由于往来树间找寻花蜜的蜂偶然沾上花粉而有效地受精了。现在回到虚拟的个案：一旦植物变得高度吸引昆虫，花粉便会定时在花间传播，另一个过程就可以开始了。没有一个学者会怀疑所谓“生理分工”的好处，所以可以相信，一朵花或全株植物只生雄蕊，而另一朵花或另一植株只生雌蕊，对于植物是有利的。植物栽培时放在新的生活条件下，有时候雄性器官，有时候雌性器官，好歹会变为不育。如果假定自然状况下也有这种情况发生，不论其程度多么轻微，那么，由于花粉已经定时在花间传播，按照分工原则植物较为完全的雌雄分化是有利的，有这种倾向的个体会越来越多，就会连续得到青睐而选择下来，最终达到两性的完全分化。

现在让我们谈谈虚拟个案里吃花蜜的昆虫：假定由于连续选择使得花蜜慢慢增多的植物是一种普通植物，而某些昆虫主要是依靠其花蜜为食。可以举出许多事实，来说明蜂为了节省时间是多么急不可耐。例如，它们有在某些花的基部咬一个洞来吸食花蜜的习性，虽然只要稍微麻烦一点就能从口部进去。记住这些事实，就没有理由怀疑，虫体大小体型、喙曲度和喙长的偶然偏差等等个体差异，固然微细难察，但是对于蜂等昆虫可能是有利的，这种性状的个体能够更快得到食物，有更好的机会生存和繁衍后代。其后代也许会继承构造有类似微小偏差的倾向。红三叶草和绛三叶草（incarnatum）管形花冠的长度，粗看起来并没有什么差异，但蜜蜂能够容易地吸取绛三叶草的花蜜，却不能吸红三叶草，只有大黄蜂才来光顾它；所以红三叶草虽漫山遍野，却不能把大量供应的珍贵花蜜供给蜜蜂。因此，蜜蜂喙略长些或者构造略有差异，会大有利。相反，我做实验发现，三叶草的能育性绝对要依靠蜂类来光顾它的花，并且移动部分花管，以便把花粉摁到柱头表面。于是，如果哪个地区大黄蜂稀少起来，红三叶草花管较短或花管裂较深就大大有利，这样蜜蜂就能够光顾它的花了。这样，我就能理解，通过连续保存呈现双向的轻微有利构造偏差的个体，花和蜂如何慢慢地同时或先后发生了变异，并且以最完善的方式来互相适应。

我深知，以上述虚拟例子来说明自然选择的学说，会遭到反对，正如当初赖尔爵士的“地球近代的变迁，地质学的例证”这种高见遭到反对是一样的；不过，运用海岸波浪等等的作用，来解说深谷的凿成或内陆的长线崖壁的形成时，现在很少听到有人说这是小儿科不重要的事情了。自然选择的作用，只能是把每一个有利于生物的微小遗传变异保存累积起来；正如近代地质学差不多摒弃了一次洪水能凿成大山谷的观点那样，自然选择如果是正确的原则，也将摒弃连续创造新生物的观点，摒弃生物的构造发生巨大突变的观点。




论个体的杂交。——这里必须稍微讲些题外话。雌雄异体的动物和植物每次生育，其两个个体都必须交配，这当然是很明显的事；但在雌雄同体的情况下，这一点并不明显。然而我强烈倾向于认为，一切雌雄同体的两个个体或偶然地或习惯地亦要接合以繁殖它们的种类。补充一句，这种观点是安德鲁·奈特最早提出的。不久就可以看到此论的重要性；但这里必须把这个问题略提一下，虽然我有材料可做充分的讨论。所有脊椎动物、所有昆虫以及其他某些大类的动物，每次的生育都交配。近代的研究已经把曾认为雌雄同体的数目大大减少了；大多数真的雌雄同体的生物也交配。这就是说，两个个体定时进行交配以便生殖，这就是我们所要讨论的全部，但是依然有许多雌雄同体的动物肯定不经常进行交配，并且大多数植物是雌雄同株的。于是可以问：有什么理由可以假定在这种个案里，两个个体为了生殖而进行交配呢？这里详细讨论这一问题是不可能的，所以只能做一般的考察。

首先，我曾搜集过大量事实，表明动植物变种间的杂交，或者同变种而不同品系的个体间的杂交，可以提高后代的强壮性和能育性；相反，近亲交配可以减小其强壮性和能育性，这和饲养家们的近乎普遍的信念是一致的。仅仅这些事实就使我相信，没有一种生物世世代代永远自营受精，这是自然界的一般法则（其意义我们却一无所知）；和另一个体偶然地进行交配——也许相隔较长的期间，是必不可少的。

我想，相信了这是自然法则，就能理解几大类事实，比如以下事实如用任何其他观点都不可解释。培养杂种的人都知道：暴露在雨下，对于花的受精是何等不利，然而花粉囊和柱头完全暴露的花是何等之多！可是，如果偶然的杂交是不可缺少的，那么从他花个体来的花粉可以充分自由地进入，就可以解释这种暴露状态了，特别是植物自己的花粉囊和雌蕊一般靠得这么近，自花受精看上去简直不可避免。另一方面，有许多花却将结籽器官紧闭，如蝶形花科（papilionaceous）即豆科这一大科便是如此；但若干乃至全部这种花朵的构造与蜂吸花蜜的方式之间具有很奇妙的适应。这样做，要么将自身的花粉推向柱头，要么将其他花粉带过来。蜂的光顾对于蝶形花十分必要，我从其他地方发表的实验结果发现，蜂如遭挡驾，该花的能育性就会大大降低。你看，蜂在花间飞来飞去，很少不将花粉带来带去的，我看这就对植物大大有利。蜂的作用有如驼毛刷，只要先接触一花的花粉囊，再刷另一花的柱头，就足以确保受精的完成了。但不能假定，蜂能就此产生出大量的种间杂种来；假如同一把刷子把植物自己的花粉和外种花粉带来，前者的优势很大，不可避免地要完全毁灭外来花粉的影响，盖特纳就曾指出过这一点。

当花的雄蕊突然向雌蕊弹跳，或者一枝一枝慢慢地向其弯曲，这种装置好像专门适应于自花受精；毫无疑问，它有用于这个目的。不过要使雄蕊向前弹跳，常常需要昆虫的助力。如科尔路特（Kölreuter）所阐明的小蘖（barberry）情形便是这样；在小蘖属里，似乎有这种特别的装置以便利自花受精。奇怪的是，众所周知，假如把密切近似的类型或变种栽培在近处，就很难得到纯种的幼苗，因为它们是大量进行自然杂交的。在许多其他个案里，不但没有自花受精的辅助手段，还有特别的装置能够有效地阻止柱头接受自花的花粉，斯普伦格尔（C. C. Sprengel）的著作以及我自己的观察可以阐明这一点。例如，亮毛半边莲确有美丽而精巧的装置，能够把花中相连的花粉囊里的无数花粉粒，在本花柱头还不能接受之前就统统扫除出去；因为从来没有昆虫来光顾这种花，至少在我的花园是如此，所以从不结籽。然而我把一花的花粉放在另一花的柱头上，却培育成了许多幼苗。我的花园还有另一种半边莲，却有蜂来光顾，能自由结籽。在很多其他个案里，虽然没有专门的机械装置去阻止柱头接受自花的花粉，然而如斯普伦格尔指出的，我也能证实，要么花粉囊在柱头能受精以前便已裂开，要么柱头在花粉未成熟以前已经成熟，事实上是雌雄分化的，必定习惯性地进行杂交。这些事实是何等奇异啊！同一花中的花粉位置和柱头平面是如此接近，好像为了自花受精专用似的，但在许多个案中，彼此并无用处，这又是何等奇异啊！如果用不同个体的偶然杂交是有利的或必需的观点，来解释此等事实，是何等简单啊！

假如让圆白菜、萝卜、洋葱等植物的若干变种在相互接近的地方进行结籽，我发现由此培育出来的大多数实生苗都是杂种。例如，我把几个圆白菜的变种栽培在一起，由此培育出233株实生苗，其中只有78株保持了原有种类的性状，甚至其中还有若干不是完全纯粹的。然而，每一菜花的雌蕊不但有自己的六个雄蕊所围绕，同时还有同株上的许多花的雄蕊所围绕。那么，这许多的幼苗是怎么变为杂种的呢？我看，必定是因为其他变种的花粉比自己的花粉更占优势的缘故；属于同种的不同个体互相杂交有好处的一般法则。如果不同的物种进行杂交，其情形正相反，因为这时植物自己的花粉总是要比外来的花粉占优势；这一问题在以后一章里还要讲到。

在一株大树开满无数花的个案里，我们可以反对说，花粉很少能进行树间传送，充其量只能在同树上进行花间传送而已；而且同树上的花，只有从狭义来说，才可看作不同的个体。我认为这种反对有效，但是大自然对此已大致有所防范，给予树以开出雌雄分化的花的强烈倾向。雌雄分化了，虽然雄花和雌花仍然生在同树上，可以看到花粉必须定时在花间传送；这样花粉就有更好的机会，会偶然出现树间传送。属于所有“目”（Orders）的树，在雌雄分化上较其他植物更为常见，我在英国所看到的情形就是这样；根据我的请求，胡克博士把新西兰的树列成了表，阿萨·格雷（Asa Gray）博士把美国的树列成了表，其结果都不出我之所料。另一方面，胡克博士最近告诉我说，他发现这一规律不适用于澳洲；我对于树的性别所说的这几句话，仅仅为了引起对这一问题的注意而已。

现在略为谈谈动物方面：陆栖种有一些雌雄同体的，例如陆栖的软体动物和蚯蚓，但它们都需要交配。我还没有发现过一种陆栖动物能够自营受精。根据偶然杂交必不可少的观点，考虑一下陆栖动物的生活环境，以及精子的性质，就可以理解这种显著的事实了，它与陆栖植物对照强烈。陆栖动物无法类似于植物那样依靠昆虫或风做媒介，如果没有两个个体交配，不知道偶然的杂交有什么完成的途径。水栖动物有许多种类是能自营受精的雌雄同体，但水的流动显然可以做偶然杂交的媒介。我咨询过最高权威之一，即赫胥黎教授，我希望能找到一种雌雄同体的动物个案，生殖器官完全封闭在体内，可以证明外界进入和不同个体的偶然影响在物质上不可能发生，结果至今没有成功。在这种观点下，我早就觉得蔓足类（cirripedes）是很难解释的个例；但我有幸在他处证明了它们的两个个体，虽然都是自营受精的雌雄同体，确也有时进行杂交。

无论在动物或植物里，同科中甚至同属中的物种，虽然整个体制上大同小异，却不时有雌雄同体和雌雄异体之分，这想必使大多数学者觉得奇哉怪也。但是如果一切雌雄同体的生物事实上也偶然杂交，那么它们与雌雄异体的物种之间的差异，从机能上来讲是很小的。

从这几项内容以及从我搜集的但不能在这里举出的许多特别事实看来，我强烈倾向于认为，动植物界内部，与不同个体的偶然杂交是自然法则。我清楚，根据这种观点，存在不少难解的个案，我正在对其中一些进行调查。最后，我们总结如下，在许多生物中，两个个体之间杂交对于每一次生殖显然是必需的，在不少生物中，也许杂交间隔很久才进行，但我认为，没有一种生物可以永久保持自营受精。




有利于自然选择的条件。——这是极为错综复杂的问题。大量的可遗传、多样性变异是有利的，但我看个体差异就足以起作用了。个体数量大，可增加一定时期内出现有利变异的机会，以补偿各个个体较少的变异量；所以我相信，这是成功的极重要因素。虽然大自然可以给予长久的时间让自然选择运作，却并不能给予无限的时间；一切生物都可以说努力在自然结构中占地盘，如果没有随着竞争者发生相应程度的变异和改进，任何物种都很快会灭绝。

在人类按部就班的选择中，饲养家为了一定的目的进行选择，如果出现个体自由杂交，他的工作就要全盘终止。但是，有许多人没有改变品种的意图，却有一个近乎共同追求完美的标准，都试图用最优良的动物繁殖后代，虽然劣种动物参与大量的杂交；这种无意识的选择，肯定也会步步为营地使品种得到改进和变异。在自然状况下也是这样；在局限的区域内，自然版图中还有地盘未被完全占据，自然选择总是倾向于保存一切多多少少向正确方向变异的个体，以便更好地填充空地。但如果地区辽阔，其中的各个区域几乎必然要呈现不同的生活条件；如果自然选择在若干区域内使一个物种变异改良，那就要在各个区域的边界上与同种其他个体进行杂交。在这种情况下，杂交的效果很难被自然选择所抵消，尽管自然始终在让各个区域的全部个体按照其条件进行完全相同的变异。在连续的地域，区域间的条件一般不知不觉地渐变过渡。凡是每次生育都交配的、游动性大且繁育不十分快的动物，特别会受到杂交的影响。所以具有这种本性的动物，例如鸟，其变种一般仅局限于隔离的地区内，我认为情况正是如此。仅仅偶然进行杂交的雌雄同体的生物，还有每次生育都交配但很少迁移而增殖很快的动物，就能在任何一处迅速形成新的改良变种，并且常能在那里聚集成群，使杂交主要在同一个新变种的个体间进行。这样形成地方变种，然后可能慢慢散布到其他区域。根据这一原则，苗圃园工常常喜欢从大群的同变种植物中留存种子，以便减少其与其他变种杂交的机会。

甚至在每次生育都交配而繁殖不快的动物里，我们也不能过高估计杂交延缓自然选择的效果。我可以举出一大堆事实来说明，在同一地区内，同种动物的各变种可以长久保持区别，这是由于栖息地不同，由于繁殖的季节略有不同，由于同一变种的个体喜欢聚头进行交配。

杂交在自然界中起着很重要的作用，使同一物种或变种的个体在性状上保持纯粹和一致。对于每次生育都交配的动物，作用显然更为有效；但前文说过，有理由相信，一切动植物都会偶然进行杂交。即使只在间隔长时间后才进行杂交，我坚信这样生下来的幼体在强壮和能育性方面都远胜于长期连续自营受精生下来的后代，会有更好的生存并繁殖其种类的机会。这样，即使间隔的时期很长，杂交的影响归根到底还是很大的。如果果真存在从不杂交的生物，只要生活条件不变，就能使性状保持一致，但只有通过遗传的原理以及通过自然选择，把那些离开固有模式的个体消灭掉。如果生活条件改变了，也发生变异了，那只有依靠自然选择对于相似有利变异的保存，变异了的后代才能获得性状的一致性。

自然选择过程中，隔离也是一种重要因素。在有限或者隔离的地区内，如果不很大，则有机和无机的生活条件一般是十分一致的；所以自然选择会使整个地区同种的所有个体按照同样方式针对同样的条件进行变异。而与周围不同环境地区内本来会居住的同种生物的杂交也将遭阻止。但隔离也许能更加有效地遏制气候、海拔高度等发生了物理变化之后适应性较好的生物的移入；因此地方自然生态体系就空出新场所来了，供旧有生物去争夺，并且通过构造和体质的变异而加以适应。最后，隔离阻止移入因而阻止竞争，能为新变种的缓慢改进提供时间，这对于产生新物种有时是重要的。但是，如果隔离的地区很小，要么靠周围障碍物形成，要么靠很特别的物理条件，那么其支撑的个体总数势必很少；个体少会大大延缓通过自然选择产生新种，因为减少了有利变异出现的机会。

如果依靠自然界来验证这话是否正确，观察任何一处隔离小区域，例如海岛，虽然生活在那里的总物种数目很少，如“地理分布”一章所见，但是这些物种的极大部分是本地特产——就是说，产地在那里，世界别处是没有的。所以乍一看，好像海岛对于产生新种是大为有利的。但这样我们可能欺骗了自己，因为如果要确定究竟是隔离的小地区，还是开放的大地区如一片大陆，最有利于产生生物新类型，应当在相等的时间内来做比较，然而这是我们不可能做到的。

虽然我并不怀疑隔离对于新种的产生相当重要，但总的说，我倾向于相信区域的广大更为重要，在产生能够天长地久而且能够广为分布的物种上尤其如此。在广大而开放的地区内，不仅可以维持同种的大量个体生存，因而有较好的机会发生有利变异，而且已经存在的物种有许多，因而生活条件极其复杂；如果众多物种中有些已经变异或改进了，那么其他物种势必也要相应程度地来改进，否则就要遭消灭。每一新类型，一旦得到大的改进，就能够向开放的毗邻地区扩展，并与许多其他类型发生竞争。因此，更多的新场所会形成，而要填补那里空缺的竞争，大地方比孤立小地方更加剧烈。还有，广大的地区虽然现在是连续的，却因为地面的变动，最近往往呈现着断裂的状态；所以隔离的好效果，在一定范围内是普遍发生的。最后，我下结论，虽然小的隔离地区在某些方面对于新种的产生是高度有利的，然而变异的过程一般在大地区内要快得多，更有甚者，大地区内产生出来而且已经战胜过许多竞争者的新类型，是那些分布得最广而且产生出最多新变种和物种的类型。因此它们在生物界的变迁史中便占有重要的位置。

根据这种观点，我们对于“地理分布”一章里还要讲到的某些事实，大概就可以理解了。例如，澳洲这样的小大陆，现在和大幅员欧亚地区的生物比较起来，就是逊色的。正是为此，大陆生物在岛屿上到处归化。小岛上，生活竞争就不那么剧烈，变异少，灭绝也少。据希尔（Oswald Heer）说，马德拉的植物区系很像欧洲已经灭绝的第三纪植物区系，也许就因为此。所有的淡水盆地加起来，与海洋或陆地相比只是小地区。因此，淡水生物间的竞争将不像他处剧烈，新类型产生慢，旧类型灭亡也慢。硬鳞鱼类（Ganoid fishes）曾经是举足轻重的目，淡水盆地还可以找到它遗留下来的七个属；淡水里还能找到现在世界上几种最奇形怪状的动物，鸭嘴兽（Ornithorhynchus）和肺鱼（Lepidosiren），就像化石那样将自然等级上相离很远的某些目联系起来。这种动物简直可以称为活化石；由于居住在局限的地区内，竞争不剧烈，得以存留到今天。

尽管问题错综复杂，还是要总结一下对自然选择的有利条件和不利条件。我的结论是，面向未来，对陆栖生物来说，地面经过多次沉浮的广大大陆地区，因而以断层状态长期存在，最有利于产生许多新生物类型，既可长期生存，也可广泛分布。那地区起先是一片大陆，生物的种类和个体都很多，因而陷入激烈竞争。如果地面下陷，变为分离的大岛，每个岛上还会有许多同种的个体生存：各物种分布的边界上，杂交就受到抑制；在任何种类的物理变化之后，迁入受到遏制，所以各岛的自然组成中的新场所，势必由旧有生物的变异种所填充；时间也允许各岛的变种充分地变异完善。如果地面重新抬高，岛屿再变为大陆，那里就会再发生剧烈的竞争；最有利的或改进最多的变种，就能够分布开去，改进较少的类型就会大都灭绝，而新大陆各种生物的相对比例数又要发生变化；还有，这里又成为自然选择的好场所，更进一步地来改进生物，产生出新种来。

我完全承认，自然选择的作用始终是极其缓慢的。只有在区域的自然组成中留有一些地位，能由当地现存生物在经历某种变异后而较好占有，自然选择才可发生作用。这种地位的存在常决定于物理变化，而这种变化一般是很缓慢的；此外还决定于较适应类型的迁入受阻。可是自然选择的作用往往更取决于某些旧有生物发生变异慢，许多其他生物的互相关系就此打乱。除非出现有利的变异，什么都无法实现，而变异本身显然一贯是极其缓慢的过程，又往往被自由杂交所显著延滞。许多人会说，这若干原因总体上已足够抵消自然选择的作用了。我不这样看。我反而认为，自然选择的作用将永远是极其缓慢的，往往间隔长久的时间，并且一般只能同时作用于同一地方的极少数生物。我进一步认为，此等缓慢的、断续的自然选择，和地质学告诉我们的这世界生物变化的速度和方式丝丝入扣。

选择的过程虽然是缓慢的，如果力量薄弱的人类尚能在人工选择方面多有作为，那么，在很长的时间里，通过自然力量的选择，我觉得生物的变异量是没有止境的，一切生物彼此之间以及与它们的生活条件之间互相适应的美和复杂关系，也是没有止境的。




灭绝。——这个主题“地质学”一章里还要详论；但由于和自然选择密不可分，这里必须谈一下。自然选择的作用仅在于保存在某些方面有利的变异，因而使之存续。由于所有生物都按照几何级数高速增加，每一地区都已挤满了生物；于是，随着获选得宠类型数量增加，失宠的类型便减少，变得稀少了。地质学告诉我们，稀少是灭绝的前奏。我们还知道，只剩下少数个体的任何类型，遇到季节波动，或者敌害数目波动，就很有可能彻底灭绝。可以更进一步说，随着新类型持续而缓慢地产生出来，除非我们认为具有物种性质的类型可以永远无限增加，许多类型势必灭绝。地质学明白告诉我们，具有物种性质的类型的数目并没有无限增加；我们明白其没有无限增加的理由，因为自然系统中的地域数目不是无限的——倒不是我们有办法知道任何一个地区已经达到了最多物种数。也许没有一个地区已经达到了充分的居民，例如在好望角，那里的植物物种比世界任何地方都拥挤，也有某些外来植物归化，据我们所知，却并没有引起任何本土植物的灭绝。

另外，个体数目最多的物种，在任何一定期间内，有产生有利变异的最好机会。这一点已经得到证明，第二章所讲的事实指出，普通物种拥有见于记载的变种或初始物种最多。所以，数目稀少的物种在任何一定期间内的变异或改进比较迟缓；结果，在生存斗争中，就要被普通物种变异了的后代打败。

根据这些论点，我想如下结果顺理成章：随着新物种在时间的推移中通过自然选择而形成，其他物种就会越来越稀少，而终于灭绝。那些同正在变异和改进中的类型斗争最激烈的，当然首当其冲。我们在“生存斗争”一章里已经看到，密切近似的类型——即同种的一些变种，以及同属或近属的一些物种——由于具有近乎相同的构造、体质、习性，一般彼此竞争也最剧烈。结果，每一新变种或新种在形成的过程中，一般对于最接近的近亲压迫得也最狠，并且还倾向于消灭之。在家养生物里，人类对于改良类型的选择，也可看到同样的消灭过程。可以举出许多奇异的例子，表明牛、羊等动物的新品种，花卉的变种，是何等迅速地代替了那些古老低劣的种类。在约克郡，有历史记载，古代的黑牛被长角牛所代替，长角牛“又被短角牛所扫除，好像有某种致命的瘟疫一样”（某农业作者语）。




性状的分歧。——我用此术语所表示的原理是极其重要的，相信可以用来解释若干重要的事实。第一，变种，即使是特征显著的变种，虽然多少带有物种的性状——如在许多场合里，它们如何分类，常令人莫衷一是——彼此之间的差异，却远比那些纯粹而明确的物种之间的差异为小。依我看，变种是形成过程中的物种，我称为初始的物种。那么，变种间的小差异如何扩大为物种间的大差异呢？这一过程经常发生，这一点必须从自然界无数的物种大都呈现显著的差异而推论出；而变种，未来的显著物种的假想原型和亲体，却呈现微细的不明确的差异。仅仅是偶然凑巧（姑且这样叫）可能致使变种在某些性状上与亲体有所差异，以后变种的后代在同一性状上又与亲体有更大程度的差异；但是仅此一点，绝没有说明同种变种、同属异种间所表现的差异何以如此常见和巨大。

我的一向作风是从家养生物那里去探索此事的真相。这里会看到相似的情形。一羽喙稍短的鸽子引起了一个养鸽者的注意；而另一羽喙略长的鸽子却引起了另一个养鸽者的注意；在“养鸽者不要中间标准，只喜欢极端类型”这一公认原则下，他们就都选择和养育那些喙愈来愈长或愈来愈短的鸽子（翻飞鸽的亚品种实际就是这样产生的）。还有，我们设想，古代一个人喜欢快捷的马，而另一个人却需要强壮高大的马。最初的差异可能是极微细的；但是随着时间的推移，一方面连续选择快捷的马，另一方面却连续选择强壮的马，差异就增大起来，因而便会形成两个亚品种。最后，经过若干世纪，亚品种就变为两个稳定的不同品种了。等到差异慢慢扩大，具有中间性状的劣等马，即不甚快捷也不甚强壮的马，将遭到冷落，从此就逐渐消失了。这样，我们从人类的产物中看到了所谓分歧原理的作用，它引起了差异，最初仅仅是微小的，后来逐渐增大，于是品种之间及其与共同亲体之间，在性状上便有所分歧了。

试问，类似的原理怎么能应用于自然界呢？我相信能应用而且应用得很有效，因为原委很简单，任何物种的后代，如果在构造、体质、习性上越有多样性，那么在自然组成中，就越能占有各种不同的地方，而且在数量上也就越能增加。

在习性简单的动物里可以清楚地看到这种情形。以食肉的四足兽为例，它在任何能够维持生活的地方，早已达到饱和的平均数。如果允许自然增殖力起作用的话（区域条件没有任何变化的情形下），只有依靠变异的后代去取得其他动物目前所占据的地方，才能成功地增殖。例如，其中有些变为能吃新种类的猎物，无论死活，有些能栖息新地方，爬树、涉水，有些或者可以减少肉食习性。食肉动物的后代，在习性和构造方面越是多样性，所能占据的地方就越多。适用于一种动物的原理，也能应用于一切时间内的所有动物——如果发生变异的话；否则自然选择便无能为力。关于植物也是如此。试验证明，如果一块土地上仅播种一个草种，同时另一块类似土地上播种若干不同属的草种，就能生长更多的植物，收获更重的干草。如在同样大小的土地上先播种一个小麦变种，再混播几个小麦变种，情况也同样。所以，如果任何一个草种继续进行着变异，并且连续选择各变种，就将像异种异属的草那样彼此相区别，虽然区别很小，那么这个草种的更多个体，包括变异了的后代在内，就能成功地在同一块土地上生活。我们知道每一物种和每一变种的草年年都散播无数种子；可以说，都在竭力增殖。结果，数千代以后，不能怀疑任何一个草种的最显著变种都会有成功以及增殖的最好机会，这样就能淘汰较不显著的变种；变种到了彼此截然分明的时候，便取得物种的等级了。

构造的巨大多样性，可以维持最大量的生物，这一原理的正确性已在许多自然情况下看到。在一块极小的地区内，特别是对自由迁入开放时，个体之间的斗争必定是剧烈的，总是可以看到巨大的生物多样性。例如，我看见一片草地，面积为三英尺乘四英尺，多年来都暴露在完全同样的条件下，那里生长着二十个物种的植物，属于十八个属和八个目，可见这些植物的差异是何等巨大。在一成不变的小岛上，植物和昆虫也是这样的；淡水池塘中也是如此。农人知道，用决然不同“目”的植物进行轮种，收获的粮食更多：自然界所进行的可以叫作同期轮种。密集生活在任何一片小土地上的动植物，大多能够在那里生活（假定这片土地没有任何特别的性质），可以说，它们都百倍努力地在那里生活；但是，可以看到，在斗争最尖锐的地方，构造多样性的优势，伴随着习性和体质的差异，决定了彼此争夺得最厉害的生物，一般是那些属于我们叫作异属和异目的生物。

植物通过人类的作用在异地归化这一方面，同样的原理也有表现。可以料想，任何土地上能够归化的植物，一般都是那些和土著植物在亲缘上密切接近的种类；因为土著植物一般被看作是特别创造出来而适应于本土的。也许还可以料想，归化的植物大概只属于少数类群，特别适应新乡土的一定地点。但实际情形却很不同；德康多尔在他的力作里说得好，归化的植物如与土著的属和物种的数目相比，则其新属要远比新种为多。举一个例子，阿萨·格雷博士的《美国北部植物志》的最后一版里，举出260种归化的植物，属于162属。由此可见，这些归化的植物具有高度多样性。而且，它们与土著植物大不相同，因为在162个归化的属中，非土生的不下100个属，这样，现今生存于美国的属，就大大增加了。

对于任何地区内与土著生物斗争而获胜，并且就地归化的动植物的本性加以考察，就可以大体认识到，某些土著生物必须怎样发生变异，才能胜过其他土著；我们至少可以推论出，构造的多样性达到新属差异的，于它们是有利的。

事实上，同一地方生物多样性的好处，与某个体各器官的生理分工所产生的好处是相同的——米尔恩·爱德华兹（Milne Edwards）已经明白讨论过这一主题了。没有一个生理学家会怀疑专门消化植物性物质的胃，或专门消化肉类的胃，能够从这些物质中吸收最多的养料。所以在任何土地的总体系统中，动植物对于不同生活习性的多样性越是广泛而完善，能够在那里维持的个体数量就越大。一组体制很少多样化的动物很难与一组构造完善多样化的动物相竞争。例如，澳洲的有袋目动物可以分成若干群，但彼此差异不大，正如沃特豪斯（Waterhouse）先生等人所指出的，它们隐约代表着食肉的、反刍的、啮齿的哺乳类，但能否成功地与这些发育良好的目相竞争，是存疑的。澳洲的哺乳动物里，我们看到多样化过程处于早期的不完全发展阶段中。

根据上面有待大大充实的讨论，我们可以假定，任何一个物种的变异后代，在构造上越多样化，便越能成功，并且能侵入其他生物占据的地方。现在我们看一看，从性状分歧大有益的这个原理，结合自然选择的原理和灭绝原理之后，能起怎样的作用。

本书所附的图表，有助于理解这个扑朔迷离的主题。设A到L代表某地一个大属的诸物种；假定它们的相似程度并不相等，正如自然界的一般情形那样，图表里用不同距离的字母表示。我说的是一个大属，第二章说过，大属比小属平均有更多的物种发生变异，并且发生变异的物种有更多数目的变种。我们还可看到，最普通的和分布最广的物种，比罕见的和分布狭小的物种变异更多。设A是普通的、分布广的、变异的物种，并且属于本地的一个大属。从A发出的不等长、分歧扇形散开的虚线代表其变异的后代。假定变异极其微细，但性质极其多样化；假定不同时发生，而常常间隔一个长时间才发生；假定其存续期也各不相等。只有那些好歹具有利益的变异才会保存下来，或被自然选择。这里性状分歧受益原理的重要性便出现了；因为，一般这就会导致最差异的或最分歧的变异（由外侧虚线表示）受到自然选择的保存和累积。虚线遇到横线，就用小数目字标出，那是假定变异量已充分积累，因而形成一个很显著的变种，并认为在分类上有记载价值。



图表中横线之间的距离，代表一千世代，代表一万世代则更好。千代以后，设物种A产生了两个很显著的变种，a1和m1。而变种所处的条件一般还和亲代发生变异时相同，且变异性本身是遗传的；结果它们同样具有变异的倾向，并且一般差不多像亲代那样发生变异。还有，两个变种只是轻微变异了的类型，所以倾向于遗传共同亲代A的优点，因为亲代比本地大多数生物在数量上更多；它们还要遗传亲种所隶属的那一属的更为一般的优点，在自己的地区内成为一个大属。我们知道所有这些条件对于新变种的产生都是有利的。

这时，如果这两个变种仍能变异，那最分歧的变异在此后的千代中，一般都会保存下来。经过这段期间，设图表中的变种a1产生了变种a2，根据分歧的原理，a2和A之间的差异要比a1为大。设m1产生两个变种，即m2和s2，彼此不同，而和共同亲代A之间的差异更大。我们可以用同样的步骤把这一过程延长到任何久远的期间；有些变种，在每千代之后，只产生一个变种，但在变异越来越大的条件下，有些会产生两三个变种，有些则没有产生变种。因此变种，即共同亲代A的变异后代，一般会继续增加数量，继续在性状上进行分歧。图表中，这个过程表示到万代为止，在压缩和简单化的形式下，则到一万四千代为止。

但这里必须说明：我并非假定这种过程会像图表中那样有规则地进行（虽然图表本身已多少搞得不规则）。我不认为，最分歧的变种战无不胜攻无不克，得到增殖：往往是一个中间类型长期存续下来，可能产生或者不产生一个以上的变异后代。因为自然选择总是按照地位的性质而起作用，该地位未被其他生物占据，或未被完全占据；而这一点又取决于无限复杂的关系。但是，一般来说，任何一个物种的后代，在构造上越多样化，就越能占据更多的地方，它们的变异后代也就越能增殖。在上面图表里，继承线在一定的间隔中断了，标以编号的字母，标志着继承的类型已充分独立，足以列为变种。但这样的中断是虚拟的，任何地方都可以插入，只要间隔的长度允许大量分歧变异量得以积累就行。

从一个分布广、属于一个大属的普通物种产生出来的一切变异后代，常常会继承亲代在生活中得以成功的那些相同优点，所以一般既能继续增殖，又能在性状上进行分歧：这一点在图表中由A分出的数条分枝虚线表示。继承世系上后出现的更高度改进分枝的变异后代，往往会取代，也就是毁灭较早的改进较少的分枝；这在图表中表现为几条较低的分枝没有达到上面横线。有时候，变异过程无疑只限于一支世系，这样虽然在连续的世代中后代分歧变异在分量上扩大了，但变异后代在数量上并未增加。这种情形在图表中表示为，假设从A出发的各线都去掉，只留a1到a10的那一支。同样，举例说，英国赛马和英国指示犬，它们的性状显然从原种缓慢地分歧，既没有分出任何新分枝，也没有分出任何新品种。

经过万代后，设A种产生了a10、f10和m10三个类型，由于经过历代性状的分歧，相互之间及与共同祖代之间的区别将会很大，但可能变化并不相等。如果假定图表中两条横线间的变化量极其微小，那这三个类型也许还只是十分显著的变种，或者达到了亚种的可疑范畴；但只消假定这变化过程在步骤上较多或在量上较大，就可以把这三个类型变为明确的物种。因此，图表表明了由区别变种的较小差异，升至区别物种的较大差异的各个步骤。把同样过程延续更多世代（如压缩简化了的图表所示），便得到了八个物种，用字母a14到m14表示，都是从A传衍下来的。因而我相信，物种增多了，属便形成了。

大属里，发生变异的物种可能在一个以上。我假定图表里第二个物种I以相似的步骤，经过万代以后，产生了两个显著的变种（w10和z10）或两个物种，依据横线间所表示的假定变化量而定。一万四千世代后，假定六个新物种n14到z14产生了。在各个属里，性状已彼此极不相同的物种，一般会产生出最大数量的变异后代；因为它们在自然组成中拥有最好的机会来占有新的和广大不同的地方，所以在图表里，我选取极端物种A与近极端物种I，作为变异大和已经产生了新变种和新物种的物种。原属里的其他九个物种（用大写字母表示），会长久地继续传下不变的后代；由于篇幅有限，图表用不很长的向上虚线来表示。

但在变异过程中，如图表所示，起了重要作用的还有另一原理，即灭绝的原理。因为在每一处充满生物的地方，自然选择的作用必然在于选取生活斗争中比其他类型更为有利的类型，任何一个物种的改进后代经常有一种倾向：在每一世系阶段中，把前辈以及原始祖代淘汰消灭掉。必须记住，在习性、体质和构造方面彼此最相近的那些类型之间，斗争一般最为剧烈。因此，介于较早的和较晚的状态之间的中间类型（即介于同种中改进较少的和改良较多的状态之间的）以及原始亲种本身，一般都有灭绝的倾向。世系上许多整个的旁支会这样灭绝，被后来的改进支系所征服。但是，如果一个物种的变异后代进入某一不同的地区，或者很快地适应于一个全新的地方，亲子间就没有竞争，两者就都可以继续生存下去。

假定图表中所表示的变异量相当大，则物种A及全部较早的变种皆灭亡，被八个新物种a14到m14所代替；而物种I将被六个新物种（n14到z14）所代替。

还可以进一步论述。假定该属的那些原种彼此相似的程度并不相等，自然界的情况一般就是如此；物种A和B、C及D的关系比和其他物种的关系近；物种I和G、H、K、L的关系比和其他物种的关系近，又假定A和I都是很普通而且分布很广的物种，因而比同属中的大多数其他物种本来就占有若干优势。它们的变异后代一万四千世代中共有十四个物种，也许遗传了一部分同样的优点：在世系的每一阶段还以多样化的方式进行变异改进，便在居住地区的自然组成中适应了许多相关地位。因此，它们似乎极有可能，不但会取代亲种A和I而消灭之，而且还会消灭与亲种最接近的某些原种。所以，能够传到第一万四千世代的原种是极其稀少的。可以假定与其他九个原种关系最疏远的两个物种（E与F）中，只有一个物种F把后代传到这一世系晚近阶段。

图表里，从十一个原种传下来的新物种数目现在是十五。由于自然选择造成分歧的倾向，a14与z14之间在性状方面的极端差异量远比十一个原种之间的最大差异量大。而且，新种间的亲缘远近也很不相同。A传下来的八个后代中，a14、q14、p14三者由于都是新近从a10分出来的，亲缘比较近；b14和f14是在较早的时期从a5分出来的，故与上述三个物种在某种程度上有差别；最后o14、e14、m14彼此在亲缘上是相近的，但是在变异过程的开端便有了分歧，所以与前面的五个物种大有差别，它们可以成为亚属或者明确的属。I传下来的六个后代将形成两个亚属或两个属。但是原种I与A大不相同，在原属里差不多属于极端，所以I分出来的六个后代由于遗传的缘故，就与A的八个后代大不相同；而且，假定这两组生物向不同的方向继续分歧。而连接在原种A和I之间的中间种（这是很重要的论点），除F外也灭绝了，并且没有遗留下后代。因此，I的六个新种，以及A的八个新种，势必被列为很不同的属，甚至可以被列为不同的亚科。

所以我认为，两个或两个以上的属，是经过变异传衍从同一属中两个以上的物种产生的。这两个以上的亲种假定是从早期一属里某一物种传下来的。图表里是用大写字母下方的虚线来表示的，其分枝向下收敛，会聚一点；这一点代表一个物种，它就是几个新亚属或属的假定单一亲种。

新物种F14的性状值得稍加考虑，其性状假定未曾大分歧，仍然保存F的体型，无改变或少改变。这样，它和其他十四个新种的亲缘关系，属于奇怪的迂回曲折性质。由于是现在假定已经灭绝而不为人知的A和I两个亲种之间的类型传下来的，其性状应该介于这两个物种的两群后代之间。但这两群的性状已经和亲种类型有了分歧，所以新物种F14并不直接介于亲种之间，而是介于两群的亲种类型之间。每个学者都能想见这种情形的。

图表里，各条横线都设定代表一千代，但也可以代表百万代或亿代，还可以代表包含有灭绝生物遗骸的连续地层的一部分。“地质学”一章还要讨论这一主题，我想，届时将看到图表会对灭绝生物的亲缘关系有所启示。这些生物虽然一般与现今生存的生物同目、同科、同属，但常常在性状上多少介于现存的各群之间；这种事实容易理解，因为灭绝的物种生存在远古时代，那时系统线上的分枝线还只有较小的分歧而已。

我看没有理由把现在所解说的变异过程只限于属的形成。图表中，如果假定分歧虚线上的各个连续的群所代表的变异量是巨大的，则标着a14到p14、b14和f14，以及o14到m14的类型，将形成三个极不相同的属。还会有I传下来的两个极不相同的属，由于持续的性状分歧和不同祖先的遗传，与A的后代大不相同。该属的两个群，按图表所示的分歧变异量，形成了两个不同的科或目。这两个新科或新目，是从原属的两个物种传下来的，而这两个物种又假定是从某个更古老的、不为人知的属的一个物种传下来的。

我们已经看到，各地最常出现变种即初始物种的，是较大属的物种。这确实是预料之中的。自然选择是通过一种类型在生存斗争中比其他类型占有优势而起作用的，主要作用于已经具有某种优势的类型。而任何一群之为大，就表明其物种从共同祖先那里遗传了共通的优点。因此，产生新的变异后代的斗争，主要发生在努力增加数目的大群之间。一个大群将慢慢征服另一个大群，减少其数量，从而减少其继续变异改进的机会。在同一大群里，后起的更完善的亚群，由于在自然组成中分歧出来并且占有许多新的地位，就经常倾向于淘汰消灭较早的、改进较少的亚群。小的破碎群及亚群终究灭亡。展望未来，我们可以预言：现在巨大的而且胜利的、最少破碎的即最少受灭绝之祸的生物群，将长此以往继续增加。但是哪几个群将最后胜利却无法预料，因为我们知道有许多从前极发达的群，现在都灭绝了。展望更远的未来，还可预言，由于大群继续不断增多，大量的小群终究要趋于灭绝，不会留下变异后代；结果，生活在任何一个时期内的物种，能把后代传到遥远未来的只是极少数。“分类”一章还要讨论这一问题，但我可以补充一句，按照这种观点，由于只有极少数古远的物种能把后代传到今日，而且由于同一物种的一切后代形成一个纲，我们就能理解，为什么动物界和植物界的每一主要大类里，现今存在的纲是如此之少。虽然极古远的物种只有少数留下变异后代，但在最遥远的地质时代里，地球上也有许多属、科、目及纲的物种分布着，其繁盛差不多就和今天一样。




本章提要。——古往今来，在变化着的生活条件下，生物构造的各个部分如果出现变异，我想这是无可争议的；由于各个物种按几何级数增加，而在某年龄、某季节或某年代发生激烈的生存斗争，这也确是无可争议的；那么，考虑到一切生物相互之间及其与生活条件之间的无限复杂关系，会引起构造上、体质上及习性上发生对它们有利的无限多样化。如果从来没有发生过任何有益于每一生物本身繁荣的变异，就像发生的许多有益于人类的变异那样，我想是一件非常离奇的事。但是，如果有益于任何生物的变异真的发生，那么具有这种性状的个体在生活斗争中当然会有最好的机会得到保存；根据强势的遗传原理，将会产生具有同样性状的后代。我把这种保存原理简单地叫作“自然选择”。自然选择根据品质在相应龄期的遗传原理，能够改变卵、种子、幼体，就像改变成体一样容易。在许多动物里，性选择有助于普通选择，保证最强健的、最适应的雄体产生最多的后代。性选择又可使雄体独享有利的性状，以与其他雄体进行斗争。

自然选择是否真的如此发生作用，使各种生物类型变异适应于各种条件和生活处所，这必须根据以下各章所举证的一般性质和平衡来判断。但是我们已经看到自然选择怎样引起生物的灭绝；而世界史上灭绝的作用是何等巨大，地质学已说明白了。自然选择还能引起性状的分歧；因为生物的构造、习性及体质越分歧，这个地区所能维持的生物就越多。只要对任何一处小地方的生物以及外地归化的生物加以考察，便可证明这一点。所以，任何一个物种的后代的变异过程中，一切物种增加个体数目的不断斗争中，后代如果越分歧，在生活斗争中就越有成功的好机会。这样，同一物种中不同变种间的微小差异，就有逐渐增大的倾向，一直增大为同属物种间的较大差异，甚至增大为异属间的较大差异。

我们已经看到，变异最大的，是大属的那些普通的、广为分散的、分布范围广的物种；而且这些物种倾向于把现今在本土成为优势种的优越性传给变异后代。如前所述，自然选择引起性状的分歧，并能使改进较少的和中间类型的生物大量灭绝。我认为，根据这些原理，可以解释全部生物间亲缘关系的本质。这真是奇妙，只是我们熟视无睹而已，即全部时间和空间内的一切动植物，都可各分为群，而彼此从属关联，如我们到处看到的那样——即同种的变种间的关系最密切，同属的物种间的关系不那么密切且不均等，形成区（sections）及亚属；异属的物种间关系更疏远，并且属间关系远近程度不同，形成亚科、科、目、亚纲及纲。任何一个纲中的几个次级类群都不能列入单一行列，然皆环绕数点，这些点又环绕着另外一些点，循环往复，以至无穷。有人说物种是独立创造的，全部生物的分类便不能解释这一重大事实；但是，以我的判断，可根据遗传，以及引起灭绝和性状分歧的自然选择的复杂作用，如图表所见，这一点便可以解释。

同一纲中一切生物的亲缘关系常用一棵大树来表示。我看这种比喻在很大程度上表达了真实情况。绿色的、生芽的小枝可以代表现存的物种；以往年代生长出来的枝条可以代表长期连续的灭绝物种。在每一生长期中，一切生长着的小枝都试图向各方分枝，并且试图遮盖和弄死周围的枝条，就像物种和种群在伟大的生存斗争中试图压倒其他物种一样。巨枝分为大枝，再逐步分为越来越小的枝，它们本身就是树幼小时生芽的小枝；这种旧芽新芽由分枝来联结的情形，正好代表一切灭绝物种和现存物种的分类，群之下又分为群。当树还仅仅是树苗时，在许多茂盛的小枝中，只有两三枝现在成长为大枝了，生存至今，并且负荷着其他的枝条；生存在久远地质时代的物种也是这样，只有很少数遗下现存的变异后代。从这树开始生长以来，许多巨枝和大枝都枯萎而且脱落了，这些枯落了的、大小不等的枝条，可以代表那些没有留下生存的后代而仅处于化石状态的全目、全科及全属。正如这里或那里看到一个细枝从树的下部分杈处开枝散叶，并且碰巧受惠，至今还在旺盛地生长着，有时我们看到鸭嘴兽或肺鱼之类的动物，它们由疏远的亲缘关系把生物的两条大枝连接起来，因生活在有庇护的地点，而从致命的竞争里得到幸免。芽生长而出新芽，新芽如果健壮，就会分出枝条，遮盖四周许多弱枝条，所以我相信，伟大的生命之树（Tree of Life）的生长也是这样，用枯落枝条填充了地壳，用生生不息的美丽枝条遮盖了地面。





第五章　变异的法则


外界条件的影响——与自然选择相结合的用与废；飞翔器官和视觉器官——气候驯化——相关生长——生长的补偿和节约——假相关——重复的、残迹的及低等体制的构造易生变异——发育异常的部分易于高度变异：物种的性状比属的性状更易变异：第二性征易生变异——同属的物种以类似方式发生变异——长久亡失的性状的重现——提要

至此，我有时把变异说成是事出偶然，因为生物在家养状况下是如此普遍且多样，在自然状况下则不那么常见。当然，这是完全不正确的说法，但足以表明我们对于各种变异的原因一无所知。某些作者认为，产生个体差异或构造的轻微偏差，就像使孩子酷似双亲那样，是生殖系统的机能。但是，家养状况下，变异性比自然状况下更大，畸形更常发生。于是我认为，结构变异在某种程度上是生活条件的性质决定的，因为父母亲和祖先已经在这样的条件下生活了若干世代。第一章说过，生殖系统明显受生活条件变化的影响，当然需要一大串事实来证明这一点的正确性，这里从略。而后代变动的、可塑的条件，我主要归咎于父母亲的生殖系统在机能上受到了扰动。雌雄性器官似乎在形成新生命的结合发生之前就受到了影响。至于“芽变植物”的情况，芽在最早的条件下与胚珠没有本质差别，是单独受到影响的。可是，生殖系统受到扰动后，为什么这个那个部分变异更大或者更小，我们全然不知道。然而，我们时不时得到一丝丝启发，可以肯定，结构上的每次偏差，不管多么轻微，一定事出有因。

气候、食物等的改变，发生了多大直接作用，令人莫衷一是。我的印象是，在动物方面作用极微，而植物方面也许影响多一点。至少可以稳妥地断言，这种作用不能产生如我们在自然界的各种生物间所看到的构造的许多复杂的相互适应。一些微小的影响可以归结于气候、食物等等。例如福布斯（E. Forbes）断言，生长在最南方的贝类，如果是浅水的，颜色要比北方的或深水的同种贝类来得鲜明。古尔德（Gould）先生相信，同种的鸟，生活在明朗大气中的，颜色要比生活在海边或海岛上的来得鲜艳。昆虫也是如此，沃拉斯顿相信，海边生活会影响其颜色。摩坤-丹顿（Moquin-Tandon）曾列出一张植物表，所举的植物生长在近海岸处时，在某种程度上叶多肉质，虽然在别处并不如此。另外尚能举出若干类似例子。

一个物种分布到其他物种的生长区，其变种常常稍微获得该物种的某些性状，这一点符合我们关于各种物种只不过是清晰标记的永久变种的观点。比如囿于热带浅海的贝类，一般比深海冷水贝类的外壳更加艳丽。内陆鸟类比海岛鸟类颜色更加鲜艳，这是古尔德先生的观点。收藏者都知道，囿于沿海的昆虫，外壳往往是古铜色或者鲜艳色的。囿于海滨的植物容易生长肉质的叶子。相信每一个物种都是神创的人必定会说，这个贝类为了暖和的海水而天生鲜艳的贝壳，而另一种贝类分布到暖水浅海时就因变异而变得鲜艳了。

当变异对生物有极微小的用处时，就无法说出这一变异有多少应当归因于自然选择的累积作用，有多少应当归因于生活条件作用。例如，皮货商都很熟悉，同种动物生活的气候越严寒，毛皮就越厚越好；但谁能说出差异有多少是由于毛皮最温暖的个体在许多世代中得到惠及而被保存，有多少是由于严寒气候的直接作用呢？因为气候似乎对于家畜的毛皮是有某种直接作用的。

同一物种在分明不同的外界条件下，产生了相同的变种，而在相同的外界条件下，却产生了不相似的变种，这样的事例不胜枚举，表明生活条件的作用想必是何等间接。还有，有些物种虽然生活在极相反的气候下，仍能保持纯粹，完全不变，这样的事例不计其数，学者人人都熟悉的。这种情况使我不重视周围条件的直接作用。上面提及，间接地，周围条件似乎能大大影响生殖系统，从而引起变异性。然后，自然选择将有益的变异统统积累起来，不管多么轻微，直到明显发展，为我们所察觉。




用和废的作用。——根据第一章所述，家养动物有些器官因使用而加强和增大，有些器官因不使用而缩小，我想这是无可怀疑的，而且这种变化是遗传的。在不受拘束的自然状况下，由于不知道祖代的类型，所以没有比较的标准来判别长久连续使用和不使用的效果；但是许多动物所具有的构造，是能够按不使用的效果而解释的。欧文教授说，自然界没有比鸟不能飞更为异常的了，然而若干鸟类却是这样的。南美洲的大头鸭（logger-headed duck）只能在水面上扑腾翅膀，翅膀几乎和家养的艾尔斯伯里鸭（Aylesbury duck）一样。地上觅食的大型鸟，除避险以外很少飞翔，所以我认为现今或不久之前栖息在无猛兽海岛上的几种鸟几乎没有翅膀，是不使用的缘故。鸵鸟的确是栖息在大陆上的，它暴露在不能靠飞翔来逃脱的危险下，但能够像小型四足兽那样踢敌自卫。可以想象，鸵鸟一属的祖先，习性原是和大雁相像的，但自然选择在连续的世代里增加了其身体的大小重量，就更多地用腿，而更少地用翅膀，终于变得不能飞翔。

柯比（Kirby）说过（我也曾看到过同样的事实），许多吃粪的雄性甲虫的前趾节，即前足常常会断掉；他检查了所采集的十七个标本，没有一个留有一点痕迹。阿佩勒蜣螂（Onites apelles）前足跗节的亡失司空见惯，所以常描述为不具有跗节。某些其他属虽具有跗节，但只是一种残迹的状态而已。埃及人的圣甲虫（Ateuchus）跗节完全缺如。没有足够的证据可以认为肢体损伤能遗传；我认为，圣甲虫全然没有前足跗节，某些其他属仅仅留有跗节的残迹，最妥当的解释是祖先长久持续不使用的结果；因为许多吃粪的甲虫一般都失去了跗节，这一定发生在生命早期；所以，此种昆虫无法大事使用跗节。

在某些个案里，很容易把全部或主要由自然选择所引起的构造变异归咎于不使用。沃拉斯顿先生发现了一件引人注目的事实，就是栖息在马德拉的550种甲虫中，有200种甲虫的翅膀不完全而不能飞翔；二十九个土著的属中，不下二十三个属的所有物种都是这样的情况！还有，世界上有许多地方的甲虫常常被风刮到海中溺死，而马德拉的甲虫据沃拉斯顿的观察，隐蔽得很好，直到风和日丽方才出来；无翅甲虫的比例数，在没有遮拦的德塞塔群岛（Desertas）比在马德拉更大。特别奇异的是，沃拉斯顿特别重视一个事实，生活习性需要经常使用翅膀的某些大群甲虫，其他各地非常多，但这里却几乎绝迹——凡此种种，让我相信，这么多的马德拉甲虫之所以没有翅膀，主因是自然选择的作用，也许配合了不使用。因为在成千上万连续的世代中，有些甲虫个体要么翅膀发育得稍不完全，要么习性怠惰，飞翔最少，不会被风吹到海里去，因而获得最好的生存机会；反之，最喜欢飞翔的甲虫个体最常被风吹到海里去，因而遭到毁灭。

马德拉也有不在地面觅食的昆虫，如某些在花朵中觅食的鞘翅类和鳞翅类，必须经常使用翅膀以获取食物，据沃拉斯顿先生猜测，这些昆虫的翅膀不但一点也没有缩小，甚至会更加增大。这完全符合自然选择的作用。当新的昆虫最初到达此岛时，增大或者缩小翅膀的自然选择的倾向，将取决于战风胜利而保存下来的个体多，还是放弃这种企图，少飞、不飞而保存下来的个体多。譬如船在近海失事，对于船员来说，善于游泳的游得越远越好，不善于游泳的，攀住破船倒好些。

鼹鼠和某些穴居的啮齿类动物，眼睛大小如残迹，某些个案的眼睛被皮和毛所遮盖。眼睛的这种状态大概是由于不使用而渐渐缩小的缘故，不过这里恐怕也辅以自然选择。南美洲一种穴居的啮齿动物，叫作吐科吐科（tuco-tuco），拉丁文Ctenomys，深入地下的习性甚至有过于鼹鼠；一位常捉此动物的西班牙人告诉我说，其眼睛多半是瞎的。我养过一只活的，眼睛的确是这种情形，解剖后才知道原因，瞬膜发炎。眼睛常常发炎对于任何动物必定是有害的，而眼睛对穴居习性的动物肯定不是必要的，所以眼睛缩小，上下眼睑粘连，上面生毛，可能是有利的；倘使有利，自然选择就会不断辅助不使用的效果。

众所熟知，奥地利施蒂里亚（Styria）及美国肯塔基州（Kentucky）的洞穴里，栖息有几种属于极其不同纲的盲目动物。某些蟹虽然已经没有眼睛，眼柄却依然存在；望远镜的透镜已经丢了，而镜架还依然存在。对于生活在黑暗中的动物来说，眼睛虽然没有用处，很难想象会有什么害处，所以其亡失归因于不使用。有一种盲目动物，叫作洞鼠（cave-rat），两只眼睛硕大。西利曼（Silliman）教授认为，在光线下生活若干天后，它恢复了微弱的视力。就像马德拉岛一样，某些昆虫的翅膀扩大了，某些昆虫的翅膀缩小了，原因是自然选择，辅助以用和废；洞鼠的情况是，自然选择似乎与失去光线斗争过，扩大了眼睛的尺寸；而对于洞中所有其他动物而言，似乎唯有不使用大显身手了。

很难想象，生活条件还有比几乎相似气候下的石灰岩大洞更为相似的了；所以按照盲目动物系为美洲和欧洲的岩洞分别创造出来的旧观点，可以预料到它们的体制和亲缘是极其相似的。可希厄特（Schiödte）等人指出，情况并非如此；两大陆的岩洞昆虫，预料也不比欧洲和北美洲的动物之间的一般类似性更密切相关。依我看，必须假定美洲动物具有正常的视力，它们逐代慢慢地从外界移入肯塔基洞穴的越来越深的处所，就像欧洲动物移入欧洲的洞穴里那样。我们有这种习性渐变的某种证据；希厄特说过：“预备从光明转入黑暗的动物，与普通类型相距并不远。构造适于微光的类型继之而起，最后是适于全黑暗的那些类型。”动物经过无数世代，达到最深的深处时，眼睛因不使用而差不多完全灭迹了，而自然选择常常会引起别的变化，如触角或触须的增长，作为盲目的补偿。尽管有这种变异，我们还能看出美洲的洞穴动物与美洲大陆别种动物的亲缘关系，欧洲的洞穴动物与欧洲大陆动物的亲缘关系。我听达纳（Dana）教授说过，美洲的某些洞穴动物确系如此，而欧洲的某些洞穴昆虫与其周围地方的昆虫极其密切相似。如果按独立创造的普通观点来看，对于盲目的洞穴动物与该两大陆其他动物之间的亲缘关系，就很难给予合理的解释。新旧两个世界的若干洞穴动物的亲缘密切关联，可从众所周知的这两个世界的大多数其他生物间的关系料想到。有些穴居动物十分古怪，如阿加西斯（Agassiz）说过的洞鲈（Amblyopsis），又如欧洲的爬行动物洞螈（Proteus），这没有什么值得大惊小怪的，我所惊奇的只是古生物的残余没有保存得更多，因为住在这种黑暗处所的动物，竞争也许并不激烈。




气候驯化。——植物的习性是遗传的，如开花期、种子发芽时所需要的雨量、休眠的时间等等，因此我要略谈一下气候驯化。同属不同种的植物栖息在热地和寒地原是极其普通的，我认为同属的一切物种确是由单一的亲种传下来的，如果说得对，那么气候驯化必定在传承的长期过程中轻易实现。众所周知，每一物种都适应其本土气候：从寒带甚至从温带来的物种不能忍受热带气候，反过来也是一样。还有许多多汁植物不能忍受潮湿气候。但是，一个物种对于生境气候的适应程度常常被高估。我们往往无法预知一种引进植物能否忍受我们的气候，而从温暖地区引进在这里健康生长的动植物屈指可数，就是明证。有理由相信，在自然状况下，物种在分布上的限制因素，生物竞争高于等于生境气候的适应。但是不管这种适应是否普遍很贴切，有证据可以证明，少数植物好歹变得自然习惯于不同的气温了；这就是说，它们驯化了：胡克博士从喜马拉雅山上的不同高度，采集了松树和杜鹃花属的种子，栽培在英国，发现其具有不同的抗寒力。思韦茨（Thwaites）先生告诉我说，他在锡兰看到过同样事实；沃森先生曾把欧洲种的植物从亚速尔群岛（Azores）带回英国做过类似的观察。关于动物，也有若干确实的事例可以引证，有历史记载以来，物种大大地扩展分布范围，从较暖的纬度扩展到较冷的纬度，反之亦然；但是我们无法肯定，这些动物是否严格适应其本土的气候，虽然在一般情形下我们假定是这样的；我们也不知道，后来是否对于新家乡变得驯化。

我认为，家养动物最初是由未开化人选择出来的，理由是有用，同时在幽禁状态下容易生育，而不是因为后来发现它们能够输送到遥远的地方去。我想，家养动物共同的能力十分出色，不仅能够抵御千差万别的气候，而且在那种气候下完全能生育（这是更为严峻的考验）。据此可以论证，现今生活在自然状况下的动物，大多数容易引入并能够抵御千差万别的气候。然而，我们千万不要把上述论点牵强附会，因为家养动物可能起源于若干个野生祖先。例如，热带狼和寒带狼、野狗的血统恐怕混合在家犬品种里面。大鼠（rat）和家鼠（mouse）不能看作是家养动物，却被人带到世界的许多地方去，现在分布之广，远超任何其他啮齿动物；自由生活于北半球法罗群岛（Faroe）和南半球福克兰群岛（Falklands）的寒冷气候下，还生活在赤日炎炎的许多热带岛屿上。因此，对于特殊气候的适应，可以看作是大多数动物所共有的性质，容易移植于体质中内在的广泛柔性里去。根据这种观点，人类自己和家养动物对于千差万别气候的忍受能力，以及古代的大象和犀牛能忍受冰河期的气候，而它们的现存种却具有热带亚热带的习性，这些都不应看作异常的事情，而应看作是很普通的体质柔性在特殊环境下起作用的事例。

物种对于特殊气候的驯化，有多少是单纯出于习性，有多少是出于具有不同内在体质的变种的自然选择，有多少是兼而有之，这是一个难解的问题。不管是类推类比，还是农业著作甚至古代的中国百科全书的谆谆忠告，都说把动物从此地运到彼地必须十分小心，所以我必须相信习性习惯是有一些影响的。因为人类不大可能成功选择那么多的品种和亚品种，都具有特别适于他们地区的体质。我想，造成这种结果的一定是习性。另一方面，自然选择必然始终倾向于保存生来就具有最适于居住地的体质的个体，这一点毋庸置疑。论述多种栽培植物的论文里说，某些变种比其他变种更善于抵御某种气候。美国出版的果树著作明确说，某些变种惯常推荐给北方，某些变种推荐给南方；由于这些变种大多起源于近代，其体质差异不能归因于习性。洋姜（Jerusalem artichoke）从来不用种子繁殖，因而也没有产生过新变种，甚至有人提出这个例子，证明气候驯化是无法实现的，因为它一如既往地娇嫩！又如，菜豆（kidney-bean）的例子也常常因相同目的而被引证，并且更为有力；但是除非有人持续二十代播种菜豆过早，使之极大部分被霜所毁，之后从少数的生存者中采集种子，并且注意防止偶然杂交，然后同样小心地再从这些幼苗采集种子进行播种，就不能说这个试验是做过了。也不能假定菜豆实生苗的体质从来不产生差异，因为有一个报告说，某些实生苗确比其他实生苗具有更大的抗寒力。

总之，我想可以得出结论，习性、用废在某些个案中对于各种器官体质和构造的变异是有重要作用的，但用废效果大都往往和内在变异的自然选择相结合，有时后者还会支配这一效果。




相关生长。——这个术语的意思是，整个体制在生长发育中紧密结合在一起，任何一部分发生些微的变异，而被自然选择所累积时，其他部分也要变异。这是一个至关重要的主题，对此所知甚少。最明显不过的个例，就是唯有对于幼龄动物或幼虫有益的累积变异，将影响成年动物的构造，这一结论可以有把握。影响早期胚胎的畸形，同样严重地影响成年动物的体制。同源的、在胚胎早期相似的身体若干部分，似乎倾向于按照关联方式进行变异：我们看到身体的右侧和左侧，按照同样方式进行变异；前腿和后腿，甚至颚和四肢一起变异，因为人们认为下颚和四肢是同源的。我不怀疑，这些倾向好歹完全受着自然选择的支配。例如，只在一侧生角的一群雄鹿一度存在过，如果这一点对于该品种曾经有过任何大的用处，大概自然选择就会使它成为永久的了。

某些作者说过，同源的部分有合生的倾向；在畸形植物里常常看到这情形；正常构造里同源器官的结合是再普通不过的，比如花瓣结合成管状。坚硬的部分似乎能影响相连接的柔软部分的形态；某些作者认为，鸟类骨盘形状的多样化使肾的形状发生显著的多样化。另外一些人相信，人类母亲的骨盘形状由于压力会影响胎儿头部的形状。施莱格尔（Schlegel）说，蛇类身体的形状和吞食的状态决定若干最重要的内脏的位置。

这种关联结合的性质，往往令人费解。小圣提雷尔先生曾强调指出，畸形有些频繁共存，另外一些则很少共存，令人莫名其妙。对于猫，蓝眼睛与耳聋的关系，黄黑色相间与雌猫的关系；对于鸽，有羽毛的脚与外趾间蹼皮的关系，雏鸽绒毛的多寡与成年鸽羽毛颜色的关系；还有，土耳其裸狗的毛与牙的关系；虽然同源也许在这里起着作用，难道还有比这些关系更为奇特的吗？关于上述相关作用的最后一例，我想并非偶然的是，随便选出哺乳动物中表皮最异常的二目，即鲸类和贫齿类（犰狳及穿山甲等），同样全部都有最异常的牙齿。

据我所知，要表明和使用无关因而和自然选择无关的相关法则在重要构造变异上的重要性，没有任何个案比某些菊科（Compositous）和伞形科（Umbelliferous）植物的内花和外花的差异更为适宜的了。众所周知，雏菊等的中花和边花是有差异的，并且往往伴随着花的部分败育。但某些菊科植物的种子在形状和刻纹上也有差异；连子房本身，包括附属器官，都有差异，卡西尼说过的。有些作者把这些差异归因于压力，而且某些菊科边花内种子形状与这一想法相符；但是胡克博士告诉我，伞形科花冠的情况，其内花外花差异大的，往往决不是花序最密的那些物种。可以设想，外花花瓣的发育靠着从其他花朵器官吸收养料，就造成了器官的发育不全；但在某些菊科植物里，花冠并无不同，而内外花的种子却有差异。这些差异可能与流向中心花和外围花的养料流不同有关：至少我们知道，关于不整齐花，那些最接近花轴的最易变成反常整齐花（peloria），也就是整齐花。关于这一点，我再补充一个例子，是相关作用的惊人例子，我最近发现许多天竺葵属（Pelargonium）植物里，花束的中央花的上方二瓣常常失去深色的斑点；如果发生这情形，其附着的蜜腺即大为退化。如果上方的二瓣中只有一瓣失去颜色，蜜腺只是大大地缩短了。

关于花冠中花序中心花和外花的差别，斯普伦格尔说，边花的用处在于引诱昆虫，昆虫的媒介对于这两目植物的受精是高度有利的，我对这一意见并不觉得牵强附会，尽管乍看好像没道理；如果有利，则自然选择可能已经起作用了。但是，关于种子内外构造上的差别，不一定和花的差异相关，因而似乎不可能对植物有什么利益：而在伞形科植物里，此等差异具有明显的重要性——陶希（Tausch）说，外围花的种子的胚乳有时候是平腹的，中心花的种子胚乳却是中空的——所以老德康多尔用类比差别对此目植物进行主要分类。因此，分类学者们高度重视的构造变异，也许全部由于不明相关生长法则所致，据我们所能判断的，这对于物种并没有丝毫的用处。

物种的整个群所共有的、并且确实单由遗传而来的构造，往往错误地归因于相关生长；一个古代的祖先通过自然选择，可能已获得了某一种构造上的变异，而且经过数千代以后，又获得了另一种与上述变异无关的变异；这两种变异如果遗传给习性多样化的全体后代，那么自然会使我们想到它们在某种方式上一定是相关的。所以，我不怀疑还有些其他明显的相关情况在整个的目里出现，显然由自然选择的单独作用所致。例如，德康多尔说，有翅的种子从来不见于不裂开的果实；关于这一规律，我可以做这样的解释：除非蒴裂开，种子就不可能通过自然选择而渐次变成有翅的；结籽略微更适于吹扬的个体，比那些较不适于散布的种子占优势；蒴不开裂的，不可能进行这个过程。

老圣提雷尔和歌德几乎同时提出生长的补偿法则，即平衡法则；依照歌德所说的，“自然为了要在一边花费，就得在另一边节约。”我想，这种说法对于家养动物好歹是适用的：如果养料过多地流向一部分或一器官，那流向另一部分的养料至少不会过多；所以要获得一头既产奶多又容易长膘的牛是困难的。同一批圆白菜变种，不会产生数量营养双丰的菜叶，同时又结出大量的含油菜籽。水果种子萎缩时，果肉本身却在大小和品质方面大大地改进了。家鸡，头上有一大丛冠毛的，一般都伴随着鸡冠缩小，多须的，则伴随着肉垂缩小。对于自然状态下的物种，很难坚持普遍适用这一法则；但是许多优秀的观察者，特别是植物学者，都相信其正确性。然而，我这里不会列举任何例子，觉得很难用什么方法来辨别两种效果，一是一部分通过自然选择而大大发育，而另一邻近部分由于同样的过程或不使用却缩小了；另一是一部分的养料被实际夺取，而另一邻近部分过分生长。

我还怀疑，某些已提出过的补偿个案，以及某些其他事实，可以合并在一个普遍原则里，即自然选择不断地试图来节约体制的每一部分。多变的生活条件下，如果一种构造以前有用，后来用处不大了，其发育中的些许缩小都会被自然选择抓住，因为不把养料空费在建造无用的构造上去，是有利于个体的。我考察蔓足类时大开眼界，由此才理解了一项事实，而且类似的事例是很多的：即一种蔓足类如寄生在另一蔓足类体内因而得到保护时，其外壳即背甲便几乎完全消失了。雄性四甲石砌属（Ibla）就是这种情形，寄生石砌属（Proteolepas）确实更加如此：别的蔓足类的背甲都是由非常发达的头部前端的高度重要的三个体节所构成，并且具有巨大的神经和肌肉；但寄生的和受保护的寄生石砌，其整个的头的前部却缩小到仅仅留下一点非常小的残迹，附着在具有捕捉作用的触角基部。如果寄生习性造成大而复杂的构造成为多余时，其省略步骤尽管缓慢，对于该物种的各代个体都是有决定性的利益的；因为各动物都处于生存斗争之中，会通过减少养料浪费在无用构造上，来获得维持自己的较好机会。

因此我认为，身体的任何部分一成为多余，自然选择终会使它缩小省略，而毫不需要相应程度地使其他某一部分发达增大。反之，自然选择会完全成功地使一个器官发达增大，而不需要某一临近部分缩小，作为必要的补偿。

正如小圣提雷尔说过的，无论物种还是变种，凡是同一个体的任何部分或器官重复多次（如蛇的脊椎骨，多雄蕊花中的雄蕊），它的数量就容易变异；而同样的部分或器官数量较少的，就会保持稳定，这似乎已成惯例。这位作者以及一些植物学者还进一步指出，凡是重复的器官，在构造上极易发生变异。用欧文教授的用语来说，这叫作“生长的重复”（vegetative repetition），似乎是低等体制的标示。前面所说的似乎和学者们的普遍意见相关，自然系统中低级的生物比高级的生物容易变异。我这里所谓低等的意思是指体制的若干部分很少有机能专门化，只要同一器官不得不担任多样化工作时，大概能理解其为什么容易变异，也就是自然选择对于各种器官形状上的小偏差，无论保存或排斥，都比较宽松，不像对于专营一种功能的部分那样严格。这正如一把切割各种东西的刀子，差不多具有任何形状都可以；反之，专为切割某一特殊物体的工具，最好具有特殊的形状。千万不要忘记，自然选择只能通过和为了各生物的利益，才能在各部分发生作用。

正如某些作者所说的，我想是正确的，退化器官高度容易变异。以后还要讲到退化器官和发育不全器官的一般主题，这里只补充一点，其变异性似乎是由于它们毫无用处，因而也是由于自然选择无力抑制它们构造上的偏差而已。因此，退化部分任由各种生长法则发挥，受到长期废弃的影响，受到返祖倾向的支配。




比起近似物种里的同一部分，任何一个物种的异常发达的部分易高度变异。——数年前，我被沃特豪斯先生发表的与上面标题近似的论点所打动。从欧文教授关于婆罗洲野人手臂长度的观察，我推理他也似乎得出了近似的结论。要使人相信上述主张的正确性，不把我所搜集的一系列事实举出来是无望的，然而不可能在这里和盘托出。我只能说，我坚信这是一个极普遍的规律。我考虑到可能发生错误的几种原因，但希望我已对它们留下了足够的余地。必须明白，对于任何身体部分，即使是异常发达的部分，除非和许多密切近似物种的同一部分比较，显示出它异常发达，就不能应用这一规律。例如蝙蝠的翅膀，在哺乳动物纲中是一个最异常的构造，但这里并不能应用这一规律，因为一大群的蝙蝠都有翅膀；只有某一蝙蝠物种和同属的其他物种相比较，具有显著发达的翅膀，才能应用。在第二性征以任何异常方式出现的情况下，可以大大地应用这一规律。亨特（Hunter）所用的第二性征这一术语，是指属于雌雄一方的性状，但与生殖行为并无直接关系。这一规律适用于雄性和雌性，但雌性适用比较少，因为很少具有显著的第二性征。这一规律很明显适用于第二性征，可能是由于这些性状不论是否以异常的方式出现，总是具有巨大变异性——我想这毋庸置疑。但是这一规律并不局限于第二性征，雌雄同体的蔓足类就是明证。这里补充一下，我研究这一目时，特别注意了沃特豪斯的话；我坚信，这一规律几乎总是适用蔓足目。我将在未来的著作里，把显著的个案都列成一个表；这里只举出一个个案，说明这一规律的最大适用实例。无柄蔓足类（岩藤壶）的盖瓣，从各方面说都是很重要的构造，甚至在不同的属里它们的差异也极小；但有一属，即在四甲藤壶属（Pyrgoma）的若干物种里，这些瓣却呈现惊人的多样性；这种同源的瓣，形状有时在异种之间竟完全不同；而且在同种个体间，其变异量也非常之大，可以不夸张地说，这些重要器官在同种各变种间所表现的性状差异，大于异属间所表现的。

栖息在同一地方的鸟类变异极小，我曾特别注意到它们；这一规律似乎是肯定适用于这一纲的。我还不能发现这一规律可以应用于植物，若不是植物的巨大变异性使得它们变异性的相对程度特别难以比较，我对这一规律正确性的信赖就要发生严重的动摇。

看到一个物种的任何部分或器官以显著的程度或方式发育时，正当的假定是，它对于那一物种是高度重要的；然而这时该部分极易变异。为什么如此呢？根据各个物种独立创造出来的观点，即所有部分都像今天所看到的那样，我找不出什么解释。但根据各个物种群是从其他物种传下来并且通过自然选择而发生了变异的观点，我想就能得到一些启发。如果我们对于家养动物的任何部分或整体不予注意，而不施任何选择，那这一部分（例如，多径鸡［Dorking fowl］的肉冠），或整个品种，就不会再有近乎一致的性状。可以说这一品种是退化了。在残迹器官方面，在很少功用专门化的器官方面，也许在多形的类群方面，我们可以看到几乎平行的自然个案；此时，自然选择未曾或者不能发生充分的作用，因此体制便处于彷徨的状态。但是这里我们特别关心的是，在家养动物里，那些由于连续的选择作用而现今正在迅速变化的方面也是显著易于变异的。看一看鸽子的品种吧，不同翻飞鸽的嘴、不同传书鸽的嘴和肉垂、扇尾鸽的姿态及尾羽等等具有何等巨大的差异量；这些正是目前英国养鸽者主要注意的方面。甚至在同一个亚品种里，如短面翻飞鸽，众所周知要育成近乎完全标准的鸽子是极困难的，新生个体往往与标准相去甚远。因此可以说，一方面要回到较不完全变异状态去的倾向，以及进一步发生各种变异的内在倾向；一方面是保持品种纯真的不断选择的力量，两者每时每刻在进行着斗争。长远看还是选择获胜，因此我们不必担心无法从优良的短面鸽品系里育出像普通翻飞鸽那样粗劣的鸽子。不过，只要选择正在迅速进行，正在进行变异的构造总会出现巨大的变异性。还应该注意，这些人类选择所引起的可变异性状，有时候会莫名其妙地专门附着于一个性别，一般是雄性，比如传书鸽的肉垂和球胸鸽的大嗉子。

现在让我们转向自然界。任何一个物种的一个部分如果比同属的其他物种异常发达，我们就可以断言，这一部分自从该属的共同祖先分出的时期以来，已经进行了异乎寻常的变异。这一时期很少会极其久远，一个物种很少能持续一个地质时代以上。所谓异常的变异量是指非常巨大的长期变异性而言，是自然选择为了物种的利益而连续累积起来的。但是异常发达的部分或器官的变异性，既已如此巨大而且是在不很久远的时期内长久连续进行，我们一般还可发现，这些器官比在更长久时期内几乎保持稳定的体制的其他部分，具有更大的变异性。我坚信事实就是这样。一方面是自然选择，另一方面是返祖和变异的倾向，两者之间的斗争经过一个时期会停止下来；最异常发达的器官会成为稳定的，我认为毋庸置疑。因此，一种器官不管怎样异常，既以近于大致同一状态传递给许多变异后代，如蝙蝠的翅膀，按照我的理论来讲，它一定在很长久的时期内保持着差不多同样的状态；这样，它就并不比任何其他构造更易于变异。只有在变异是比较新近而且异常巨大的情况下，我们才能发现所谓发育的变异性（generative variability）依然高度存在。因为在这种情形下，由于对那些按照所要求的方式和程度发生变异的个体进行继续选择，而且对返归以前较少变异的状态进行继续排除，变异性很少固定下来。

这里所讨论的原理可以推而广之。众所周知，物种的性状比属的性状更易变异。举一个简单的例子来说明。如果在植物大属里，有些物种开蓝花，有些物种开红花，这颜色只是物种的一种性状；开蓝花的物种会变为开红花的物种，对此谁都不会感到惊奇，反之亦然；但是，如果一切物种都是开蓝花的，这颜色就成为属的性状，而它的变异便是更异常的事情了。我选取这个例子，是因为多数学者所提出的解释不能在这里应用，他们认为物种的性状之所以比属的性状更易变异，是因为其分类所根据的那些部分，其生理重要性小于属的分类所根据的那些部分。我认为这种解释部分正确，只是间接的；在“分类”一章里还要讲到这一点。引证支持物种的性状比属的性状更易变异的说法，几乎是多此一举；但我在博物学著作里一再注意到，当作者惊奇地谈到，某一重要器官或部分在物种大群中一般是极其固定的，但在亲缘密切的物种中差异却很大，而且它在某些同种的个体中常常易于变异。这一事实表明，一般具有属的价值的性状，一经降低其价值而变为只有物种的价值时，虽然其生理重要性还保持一样，但它却往往变为易于变异的了。同样的情形大概也可以应用于畸形：至少小圣提雷尔似乎毫不怀疑，一种器官越是在同群的不同物种中正常地表现差异，在个体中也越容易变态。

按照各个物种独立创造的流俗观点来看，在独立创造的同属各物种之间，为什么构造上相异的部分比密切近似的部分更容易变异？我看对此无法做出任何说明。但是，按照物种只是特征显著的和固定的变种的观点来看，当然就可以常常看到，在比较近期内变异了的因而彼此有所差异的那些构造部分，还要继续变异。换言之，凡是属内一切物种彼此相似的、而与其他属的构造相异的各点，就叫作属的性状。这些相同性状可以归因于共同祖先的遗传，因为自然选择很少能使若干不同的物种按照完全一样的方式进行变异，因这些不同的物种已经适于多少广泛不同的习性。所谓属的性状是在物种最初从共同祖先分出来以前就已经遗传下来了，此后它们没有发生什么变异，或者只出现了些许的差异，所以时至今日就不大会变异了。另一方面，同属某物种与另一物种的不同各点就叫作物种的性状。这些性状是在物种从一个共同祖先分出来以后，发生了变异并且出现了差异，所以大概还应在某种程度上常常发生变异——至少比长久保持稳定的那些体制的部分，更易变异。

关于现在的主题，我只想再说两句话。我想无须详细讨论，大家都会承认，第二性征是高度变异的。同时还会承认，同群的物种彼此之间在第二性征上的差异，比在体制的其他部分上的差异更加广泛。例如，比较一下在第二性征方面有强烈表现的雄性鹑鸡类之间的差异量与雌性鹑鸡类之间的差异量，此说的正确性便一目了然。第二性征的原始变异性的原因还不明显；但我们可以知道，为什么它们没有像其他部分那样表现了固定性和一致性，因为它们是性选择所积累起来的，而性选择的作用不及普通选择作用那样严格，它不致引起死亡，只是使较为不利的雄性少留一些后代而已。不管第二性征的变异性的原因是什么，因为它们是高度变异的，所以性选择就有了广阔的作用范围，因而也就能够轻易地使同群的物种在第二性征方面比在其他构造方面表现较大的差异量。

同种两性间第二性征的差异，一般都表现在同属各物种彼此差异所在的完全相同的那一部分，这是一个值得注意的事实。关于这一事实，我愿举出列在我的表中首当其冲的两个事例来说明；由于在这些个案中，差异具有非常的性质，其关系绝不是偶然的。甲虫足部跗节的同样数目，是极大部分甲虫类所共有的一种性状；但是韦斯特伍德说，木吸虫科（Engidae）里跗节的数目变异很大；并且在同种两性间，这个数目也有差异。还有，在掘地性膜翅类里，翅脉是大部分所共有的性状，所以是高度重要的性状；但是在某些属里，翅脉因物种不同而有差异，并且在同种两性间也是如此。这种关系对于我的观点有明显的意义：我认为同属的一切物种肯定由一个共同祖先传下来，而任何一个物种的两性也一样。因此，不管共同祖先或其早期后代有哪一部分构造成为变异的，这一部分的变异极有可能要被自然选择或性选择所利用，以使各个物种在自然组成中适于各自位置，而且使同一物种的两性彼此适合，使雄性和雌性适合不同的生活习惯，或者使雄性在占有雌性方面适于和其他雄性做斗争。

最后，我可以下结论，物种的性状即区别物种之间的性状，比属的性状即物种所共有的性状，具有更大的变异性；——一个物种的任何部分与同属物种的同一部分相比较，表现异常发达时，这一部分常常具有极度的变异性；一个部分无论怎样异常发达，如果这是全群物种所共有的，则其变异程度是不大的；——第二性征的变异性是大的，并且在亲缘密切的物种之间性状差异是大的；——第二性征的差异和通常的物种差异，一般都表现在体制的同一部分，——这一切原理都是紧密关联在一起的。这主要是由于，同一群物种都是一个共同祖先的后代，遗传了许多共同的东西，——由于晚近发生大量变异的部分，比遗传已久而未曾变异的部分，更加有可能继续变异下去，——由于随着时间的推移，自然选择能够好歹完全克服返祖和进一步变异的倾向，——由于性选择不及自然选择那样严格，——更由于同一部分的变异，被自然选择和性选择所积累，因此就使它适应了第二性征的目的以及一般物种的目的。




不同的物种呈现相似的变异；而一个物种的变种常常表现近似物种的某种性状，或者复现早期祖代的某些性状。——观察一下家养族，就极易理解这些主张。地区相隔辽远的一些极不相同的鸽的品种，呈现头生逆毛和脚生羽毛的亚变种——这是原来的岩鸽所不曾具有的性状；所以，这些就是两个以上不同的族的相似变异。球胸鸽常有十四枝甚至十六支尾羽，可以认为是一种变异，代表了另一族即扇尾鸽的正常构造。我想不会有人怀疑，所有这些相似变异，是由于这几个鸽族都是在相似的未知影响下，从一个共同亲代遗传了相同的体质和变异倾向。植物界也有相似变异的例子，见于瑞典芜菁（Swedish turnip）和芜青甘蓝（Ruta baga）的肥大的茎（俗称根部）；若干植物学者把此等植物看作是从一个共同祖先培养出来的两个变种：如果不是这样，这个例子便成为两个所谓不同物种呈现相似变异的例子了。除此两者之外，还可加入第三者，即普通芜菁。按照每一物种是独立创造的流俗观点，势必不能把这三种植物的肥大茎的相似性，都归因于共同来源的真实原因，也不能归因于同样方式变异的倾向，而势必归因于三种分离的而又密切关联的创造行为。

但是关于鸽子，还有另一个案，即所有品种会偶尔出现深蓝灰色的鸽子，翅膀有两条黑带，腰部白色，尾端有一条黑带，外羽近基部的外缘呈白色。由于所有这些标记都是亲种岩鸽的特性，我假定这是返祖个案，而不是若干品种出现新的相似变异，这是不会有人怀疑的。我想，可以有把握得出这样的结论，因为我们已经看到，这种颜色标记非常容易在两个不同的、颜色各异的品种的杂交后代中出现；在此，深蓝灰色带几种标记的重现并不来自外界生活条件的作用，而仅是依据遗传法则的杂交行为的影响。

有些性状已经失去许多世代乃至数百世代还能重现，无疑很令人惊叹。但是，当一个品种和其他品种杂交仅仅一次，其后代在许多世代中偶尔还会有复现外来品种性状的倾向——有人说大约是十二代或多至二十代。从一个祖先得来的血（用普通的说法），在十二世代后，其比例仅为两千零四十八分之一；然而，我们知道，一般认为，返祖倾向是由极少量这种外来血液所保持的。在未曾杂交过、但双亲失去了祖代某种性状的品种里，如前所述，重现失去了的性状的倾向无论强弱，差不多可以传递给无数世代，尽管可以看到反证。品种已经亡失的性状，经过许多世代以后还重复出现，最近情理的假设是，并非个体突然又酷似数百代以前的祖先，而是世世代代都有再现该性状的倾向，最后在未知的有利条件下发展起来了。例如，在很少产生蓝色黑条鸽的巴巴里家鸽里，大概每一世代都有产生蓝色羽毛的潜在倾向。这个观点是假设，但有一些事实支撑；通过无数世代传递下来的这种倾向，比十分无用的器官即残迹器官同样传递下来（我们手头有证据）的倾向，在理论上的不可能性不会更大。例如，金鱼草（snapdragon，Antirrhinum）常常出现第五雄蕊的残迹器官，它一定有该遗传的倾向。

根据我的理论，同属的一切物种既然假定是从一个共同祖先传下来的，那就可以期待，它们偶尔会以相似的方式变异；所以某一物种的一个变种在某些性状上会与另一物种相似。这另一个物种，按我的观点，只是特征显著而固定的变种而已。但是单由相似变异而发生的性状，其性质大概不重要，因为一切重要性状的存在，须依照物种的不同习性，通过自然选择而决定，而不会留给生活条件与相似遗传体质的相互作用。可以进一步期待，同属的物种偶尔会重现失去的祖先性状。然而，由于不知任何类群的共同祖先的确切性状，也就不能区别这两个个案。例如，如果不知道亲种岩鸽不具毛脚或倒冠毛，我们就不能说家养品种中出现这样的性状，到底是返祖现象，还仅仅是相似变异；但我们从众多标记可以推论出，蓝色是返祖的个案，因为标记和蓝色是相关联的，看样子不会从一次简单变异中一齐出现。颜色不同的品种进行杂交时，蓝色和标记频繁出现；由此我们尤其可以推论出上述一点。因此，尽管在自然状况下，一般必须存疑，什么个案是古已存在性状的重现，什么个案是相似的新变异，然而，根据我的理论，有时应该发现一个物种的变异着的后代具有同群的其他个体已经具有的性状，不管是返祖还是相似变异。这无可怀疑是自然界的情况。

分类中识别变异物种，难处主要在于变种好像模仿同属中的其他物种。还有，介于两个类型之间的中间类型不胜枚举，而这些类型本身列为变种还是物种也还存疑；除非把所有这些类型都认为是分别创造的物种，上述一点就表明，变异中的类型已经获得了对方的某些性状，所以才产生了中间类型。但是最好的证据还在于性状一般不变的重要部分或器官，偶尔也发生变异，好歹获得近似物种的同一部分或器官的性状。我搜集了一大堆此种个案，但这里照例无缘列举。我只能重复一遍，这种个案的确存在，我看很值得注意。

然而，我要举出一个奇异而复杂的个案，倒不是影响了任何重要性状，而是出现在同属的若干物种里，一部分是家养的，一部分是在自然状况下的。显然属于返祖现象。驴腿上不时出现很明显的横条纹，就像斑马腿：有人声称幼驴腿最为明显，我调查后，认为千真万确。还有人声称，肩上的条纹有时是双重的，在长度和轮廓方面当然易于变异。有人说有一头白驴脊上和肩上没有条纹，这不是皮肤白化病，深色的驴子这种条纹有时也很不明显或实际上完全失去了。据说由帕拉斯命名的古骏野驴（koulan of Pallas）肩上有双重条纹。野驴没有肩条纹，但布莱斯先生等人说，偶然会出现条纹痕迹；普尔（Poole）上校告诉我说，这个物种的幼驹，一般腿上都有条纹，而肩上的条纹却很模糊。斑驴（quagga）虽然躯体部有斑马状的明显条纹，腿上却没有；然而格雷（Gray）博士所绘制的一个标本，后脚踝关节处却有极清楚的斑马状条纹。

关于马，我在英国搜集了许多极其不同品种的、各种颜色的马脊上生有条纹的个案：暗褐色和鼠褐色的马腿上生有横条纹的并不罕见，栗色马中也有过一个这样的例子；暗褐色的马有时肩上生有不明显的条纹，而且我在一匹枣红马的肩上也曾看到条纹痕迹。我的儿子为我仔细检查并速写了双肩生有双重条纹、腿部生有条纹的一匹暗褐色比利时驾车马，还有一位信得过的人替我仔细查验过一匹小型暗褐色威尔士矮种马（Welsh pony）双肩上生有三条平行的短条纹。

印度西北部，凯替华（Kattywar）品种的马，通常都生有条纹。听普尔上校说，他曾为印度政府查验过这个品种，没有条纹的马被认为不是纯种马。脊上都生有条纹；腿上也通常生有条纹，肩上的条纹也很普通，有时候是双条，有时候是三条；还有，脸的侧面有时候也生有条纹。幼驹的条纹最明显，老马的条纹有时完全消失了。普尔上校见过初生的灰色和枣红色凯替华马都有条纹。从W. W. 爱德华先生给我的材料中，我有理由推测，幼小的英国赛马脊上条纹比长成的马普遍得多。这里无须赘述。可以说，我搜集了许多腿条纹和肩条纹的个案，表明不同地方的极其不同品种的马都有条纹，从英国到中国东部，从北方的挪威到南方的马来群岛，都是如此。在世界各地，这种条纹最常见于暗褐色和鼠褐色的马；暗褐色包括广大范围的颜色，从介于褐色和黑色中间的颜色起，一直到接近乳白色。

我知道史密斯（Hamilton Smith）上校曾就这个主题写过论文，认为马的若干品种是从若干原种传下来的，其中一个暗褐色的原种生有条纹；并且认为上述的外貌都因在古代与暗褐色的原种杂交所致。但我根本不相信这种说法，不愿意将它应用于天各一方、千差万别的品种，笨重的比利时驾车马，威尔士矮种马，结实的矮脚马，细长的凯替华马等等。

现在讲一讲马属几个物种的杂交效果。罗林（Rollin）断言，驴和马杂交所产生的普通骡子，腿上特别容易生有条纹。我见过一匹骡子，腿上条纹如此之多，任何人乍看都会把它当作斑马的杂种。马丁（W. C. Martin）先生在一篇有关马的优秀论文里，绘有类似的骡子图。我曾见过四张驴和斑马的杂种彩图，腿部极明显的条纹，远比身体其他部分为甚；其中一匹肩上生有双重条纹。莫顿（Moreton）爵士提出的一个著名杂种，是从栗色雌马和雄斑驴育成的，它甚至还有后来这雌马与黑色阿拉伯公马所产生的纯种后代，腿上都生有比纯种斑驴还要明显的横条纹。最后，还有一个极其值得注意的个案，格雷博士曾绘制过驴子和野驴的杂种（他告诉我，他还知道有第二个个案）；虽然驴极少腿上生有条纹，而野驴则没有，甚至在肩上也没有条纹，但是这杂种四条腿上仍然生有条纹，并且像威尔士矮种马的杂种一样，肩上还生有三条短条纹，甚至脸的两侧也生有一些斑马状条纹。关于最后这一事实，我坚信决不会有一条带色的条纹像普通所说的那样是偶然发生的，因此，驴和野驴的杂种脸上有条纹的事情便引导我去问普尔上校：是否条纹显著的凯替华品种的马脸上也曾有过条纹，如上所述，他的回答是肯定的。

对于这些事实，我们现在怎么说呢？我们看到马属的几个不同品种，通过简单的变异，就像斑马似的腿上生有条纹，或者像驴似的肩上生有条纹。至于马，我们看到，当暗褐色——这种颜色接近于该属其他物种的一般颜色——出现时，这种倾向便表现得强烈。条纹的出现，并不伴生类型上的任何变化或任何其他新性状。我们看到，这种条纹出现的倾向，以极不相同的物种之间所产生的杂种最为强烈。现在看一看几个鸽品种的情形：它们是从具有某些条纹和其他标记的一种浅蓝色鸽子（包含两三个亚种或地方族）传下来的；如果任何品种由于简单的变异而具有浅蓝色，此等条纹和其他标记必然会重现，但其类型或性状却不会有任何其他变化。当最古老最纯粹的各种不同颜色的品种进行杂交时，我们看到杂种就有重现蓝色和条纹以及其他标记的强烈倾向。我曾说过，解释这种古老性状重现的合理假设是，在每一连续世代的幼鸽里都有重现久已失去的性状的倾向，这种倾向，由于未知的原因，有时占优势。我们刚才谈到，马属的若干物种里，幼马的条纹比老马更明显或表现得更普遍，如果把鸽的品种称为物种，其中有些是几百年来纯正地繁殖下来的，那么这种情形与马属的物种是何等并行不悖！至于我自己，我敢于自信地回顾到成千上万代以前，发现有一种动物具有斑马状的条纹，其他构造则很不相同，这就是家养马（不论它们是从一个或数个野生原种传下来的）、驴、亚洲野驴、斑驴以及斑马的共同祖先。

我推测，那些相信马属各个物种是独立创造出来的人会主张，每一物种创造出来就赋有一种变异倾向，在自然状况下和家养状况下都按这种方式变异，使得它常常像该属其他物种那样变得具有条纹；同时每一物种创造出来就赋有一种强烈的倾向，当和栖息在世界上相隔甚远的地方的物种进行杂交时，所产生的杂种在条纹方面不像自己的双亲，而像该属的其他物种。依我看来，接受这种观点，就是以假代真，至少是代之以不可知的原因。这使得上帝的工作成为区区模仿和欺骗了；还不如与老朽无知的天体演化论者一起来相信，贝类化石从来就不曾生活过，而只是在石头里创造出来以模仿生活在海边的贝类的。




提要。——关于变异法则，我们深为无知。能好歹阐明任何原因的，这部分或那部分为什么对亲本发生些许变异的个案，还不到百分之一。但是每当我们使用比较的方法时，就可以看出同种的变种之间的较小差异，和同属的物种之间的较大差异，都受同样法则的支配。外界生活条件，比如气候、食物等等，似乎诱发过轻微的变异。习性在产生体质的差异上，使用在器官的强化上，以及不使用在器官的削弱缩小上，似乎表现出比较强有力的效果。同源部分倾向于按同一方式进行变异，并且有合生的倾向。坚硬部分和外在部分的改变有时能影响较柔软和内在的部分。当一部分特别发达时，也许就倾向于向邻近部分吸取养料；而构造的每一部分如果被省略了而无损害，就会被省略掉。构造的早期变化可以影响后来发育起来的部分；相关生长的例子比比皆是，其性质我们还一无所知。重复部分在数量上和构造上都易于变异，大概由于这些部分没有为了任何机能而密切专门化，所以其变异没有受到自然选择的密切节制。也许由于同样的原因，低等生物比高等生物更易变异，高等生物的整个体制比较专门化了。残迹器官由于没有用处，不受自然选择的支配，所以也许易于变异。物种的性状——即若干物种从共同祖先分出来以后所发生的不同性状——比属的性状更易变异，后者遗传已久，且在这一时期内没有发生变异。在这些说明里，我们是指现今还在变异的特殊部分或器官而言，因为它们在近代发生了变异并且由此而有所区别；但第二章里还看到，同样的原理也可应用于整个个体；因为，如果一个地区发现了任何属的许多物种——就是说那里曾经有过许多变异和分化，或者说那里新的物种类型的制造曾经活跃地进行过——那么在那个地区，平均上，我们现在可以发现极多的变种或初始物种。第二性征是高度变异的，在同群的物种里彼此差异很大。体制中同一部分的变异性，一般曾被利用以产生同一物种两性间的第二性征差异，以及同属的若干物种的种间差异。任何部分或器官，与其近缘物种的同一部分或器官相比较，如果已经发达到相当的大小或异常的状态，那么自该属产生以来必定经历了异常大量的变异；由此可以理解，为什么它至今还会比其他部分有更大的变异；因为变异是一种长久持续的、缓慢的过程，自然选择在上述情况下尚未来得及克服进一步变异的倾向，以及重现较少变异状态的倾向。但是，如果具有任何异常发达器官的一个物种，变成许多变异后代的亲本——我认为这想必是一个很缓慢的过程，需要长久的时间——自然选择就会轻易地给这个器官以固定的性状，无论其发达方式是多么异常。从一个共同祖先遗传了几乎同样体质的物种，当暴露在相似的影响之下，自然就有表现相似变异的倾向，这些相同的物种偶尔会重现其古代祖先的某些性状。虽然重要的新变异不一定是由于返祖和相似变异而发生的，但此等变异会使自然界获得更加美妙而调谐的多样性。

不管后代和亲代之间的每一轻微差异的原因是什么——每一差异必有因——是有利于个体的差异通过自然选择的逐渐积累，才引起了构造上的一切重要变异，从而地球上无数的生物得以相互斗争，充分适应，而生生不息。





第六章　学说的难点


伴随着变异的遗传学说的难点——过渡——过渡变种的不存在或稀有——生活习性的过渡——同一物种中的多样化习性——具有与近缘物种极其不同习性的物种——极端完善的器官——过渡方式——难点的个案——自然界没有飞跃——重要性小的器官——器官并不统统都是绝对完善的——自然选择学说所包括的模式统一法则和生存条件法则

读者远在读到本章之前，想来已经遇到了成堆的难点。有些难点很严重，今日我想到它们还不免触目惊心。但是，据我所知，大多数的难点只是表面现象，而那些真实的难点，我想，对于这一学说也不是致命的。

这些难点和异议可以分作以下几类：第一，如果物种是从其他物种一点点地无缝逐渐遗传变成的，那么，为什么我们没有到处看到无数的过渡类型呢？为什么物种恰像我们所见到的那样界限分明，而整个自然界不呈混乱状态呢？

第二，一种动物，比方说，具有像蝙蝠那样构造和习性的动物，有可能由别种习性大相径庭的动物变化而成吗？我们能够相信自然选择一方面可以产生出很不重要的器官，如只能用作拂蝇的长颈鹿的尾巴，另一方面，可以产生出像眼睛那样的奇妙器官吗？眼睛无法模仿的完美性，我们至今没有充分领悟。

第三，本能能够通过自然选择获得和改变吗？引导蜜蜂营造蜂房的神奇本能实际上预示着学识渊博的数学家的发现，对此我们应当做何解说呢？

第四，对于物种杂交时的不育性及其后代的不育性，对于变种杂交时的能育性的不受损害，我们怎样解释呢？

前两项将在这里讨论；本能和杂种状态（hybridism）在另外的两章讨论。




论过渡变种的不存在或稀有。——因为自然选择的作用仅仅在于保存有利的变异，所以在充满生物的区域内，每一新的类型都倾向于代替并且最后消灭比自己改进较少的亲类型以及与它竞争而受益较少的类型。因此我们看到，灭绝和自然选择是并行不悖的。所以，如果我们把每一物种都看作是从某未知类型传下来的，那么亲种和一切过渡的变种，一般在这个新类型的形成完善过程中就已经被消灭了。

但是，依这种理论，无数过渡的类型一定曾经存在过，为什么我们看不到它们大量埋存在地壳里呢？在“论地质记录的不完全”一章里讨论这一问题，将会更加便利；我在这里只说明，我认为关于这一问题的答案主要在于地质记录的不完全实非一般所能想象。记录不全的主要原因是生物并不潜居深海，其遗体只有在足够厚实宽广的沉积体中才能嵌入保存到未来年代，抵御大量的未来剥蚀；而这种含化石的沉积体只有在缓慢下沉的浅海床上大量沉积时才能积累起来。这种偶发条件可遇不可求，万年才能遇到一次。海床可静止可抬升，沉积较少的，地质史就出现空白了。地壳是个巨大的博物馆，但自然界的收藏是在长久的间隔时期中间歇进行的。

但是，可以主张，当若干亲缘密切的物种栖息在同一地域内时，确实应该在今日看到许多过渡类型才对。举一个简单的例子：当在大陆上从北往南旅行时，我们一般会时不时看到亲缘密切的或代表的物种显然在自然组成里占据着几乎相同的位置。这些代表的物种常常相遇交叉，此消彼长，终于彼此淘汰。但如果在这些物种相混的地方来比较它们，就可以看出构造的各个细点一般都绝对不同，就像从各个物种的中心栖息地点采集来的标本一样。按照我的理论，这些近缘物种是从一个共同亲种传下来的；在变异的过程中，各个物种都已适应了自己区域里的生活条件，并淘汰消灭了原来的亲种以及一切连接过去和现在的过渡变种。因此，我们今日不应该希望在各地都遇到大量的过渡变种，虽然它们必定在那里存在过，并且可能以化石状态在那里埋存着。但是在具有中间生活条件的中间地带，为什么现在看不到密切连接的中间变种呢？这一难点在长久期间内颇使我惶惑，但是我想，它大体是能够解释的。

第一，如果一个地方现在是连续的，就推论它长期也是连续的，对此应当极端慎重。地质学使我们相信：大多数的大陆，甚至在第三纪末期也还分裂成岛屿；这样的岛屿上没有中间变种在中间地带生存的可能性，不同的物种大概是分别形成的。由于地形和气候的变迁，现在连续的海面在最近以前的时期，一定远远不像今日那样连续和一致。但是我不取这条道路来逃避困难；因为我相信许多定义明确的物种是在本来严格连续的地面上形成的；虽然我并不怀疑现今连续地面的以前断离状态，对于新种形成，特别对于自由杂交而漫游的动物的新种形成，有着重要作用。

观察一下现今在广大地域内分布的物种，我们一般会看到它们在一个大界域内是相当多的，而在边界处就多少突然地逐渐稀少下来，最后终于消失。因此，两个代表物种之间的中立地带比起各自的独占地带，一般总是狭小的。在登山时我们可以看到同样的事实，有时正如德康多尔所说的，一种普通的高山植物非常突然地消失了，这是十分值得注意的。福布斯在用捞网采集器探查深海时，也曾注意到同样的事实。有些人把气候和物理的生活条件看作是分布的最重要因素，这等事实应该令人惊异，因为气候和高度或深度都是不知不觉地逐渐改变的。但是如果我们记得，几乎每一物种，甚至在分布的中心地方，倘没有竞争的物种，个体数目将巨幅增加；几乎一切物种不是吃别的物种便是被吃掉；总而言之，每一生物都与别的生物以极重要的方式直接间接地发生关系，那么我们就会知道，任何地方的生物分布范围决不单单决定于不知不觉地变化着的物理条件，而是大部分决定于其他物种的存在，依赖其他物种而生活，或者被其他物种所毁灭，或者与其他物种相竞争；由于这些物种都已经是定义分明的实物（不管是怎么形成的），没有被不可觉察的各级类型混淆在一起，任何一个物种的分布范围，因依存于其他物种的分布范围，都倾向于清晰的定义。此外，各个物种在分布范围的边缘上，个体数目生存较少，由于敌害、猎物数量的波动，或季节变动，将极易遭到彻底消灭；因此，它的地理分布范围的界限就更加清晰了。

亲缘的或代表的物种生存在连续的地域内时，各物种一般都有广大的分布范围，之间有比较狭小的中立地带，它们在那里会突然地越来越稀少；如果我的这个观点正确，那么又因为变种和物种没有本质上的区别，所以同样的法则大概可以应用于两者；如果我们假想让一个正在变异中的物种适应于一片广大区域，那势必要让两个变种适应于两片大区域，并且要让第三个变种适应于狭小的中间地带。结果，中间变种由于栖息在狭小的区域内，个体数目就较少；实际上，据我所能理解的来说，这一规律是适合于自然状态下的变种的。关于藤壶属（Balanus）里的显著变种的中间变种，我看到这一规律的显著例子。沃森先生、阿萨·格雷博士和沃拉斯顿先生给我的材料表明，当介于两个类型之间的中间变种存在的时候，其个体数目一般比所连接的两个类型要少得多。如果我们相信这些事实和推论，并且断定连接两个变种的变种个体，一般较所连接的类型少的话，那我想就能理解中间变种为什么不会存续很久——中间变种为什么照例比被原来所连接的那些类型灭绝和消失得早些。

如前所述，任何个体数目较少的类型，比个体数目多的类型，会遇到更大的灭绝机会；在这种情况下，中间类型极容易被两边存在着的亲缘密切的类型所侵犯。但我认为还有更加重要的理由：在我假定两个变种改变完善为两个不同物种的进一步变异过程中，个体数目较多的两个变种，由于栖息在较大的地域内，就比在狭小中间地带内个体数较少的中间变种占有强大优势。个体数较多的类型，比个体数较少的类型，在任何给定的时期内，都有更好的机会去呈现更有利的变异，以供自然选择利用。因此，较普通的类型在生活竞争里，就倾向于压倒淘汰较不普通的类型，因为后者的改变改良是比较缓慢的。我相信，如第二章所指出的，这一同样的原理也可说明为什么每一地区的普通物种比稀少的物种平均能呈现较多的特征显著的变种。可以举例说明我的意思，假定饲养着三个绵羊变种，一个适应于广大的山区；一个适应于比较狭小的丘陵地带；第三个适应于广阔的平原。假定这三处的居民都有同样的决心和技巧，利用选择来改良品种；此时，拥有多数羊的山区或平原饲养者，将有更多的机会，比拥有少数羊的狭小中间丘陵地带饲养者在改良品种上要快些；结果，改良的山地或平原品种就会很快代替改良较少的丘陵品种；这样，本来个体数目较多的这两个品种，便会彼此密切相接，而没有那被淘汰的丘陵中间变种夹在其中。

总而言之，我认为物种终究是定义相当分明的实物，在任何一个时期内，不会有无数变异着的中间环节而造成不可分解的混乱：第一，因为新变种的形成是很缓慢的，由于变异就是一个缓慢的过程，除非有利的变异碰巧发生，同时这个地区的自然系统中有位置可以让一个或更多改变的生物更好地占据，自然选择就无所作为。这样的新位置决定于气候的缓慢变化或者新生物的偶尔移入，更重要的，也许决定于某些旧生物的徐缓变异，由此产生的新类型，便和旧类型互相发生作用和反作用。所以在任何一处地方，在任何一个时候，我们应该只看到有少数物种在构造上表现出好歹持久的轻微变异；而这的确是我们看到的情形。

第二，现在连续的地域，在过去不久的时期一定常常是隔离的部分，那里可能有许多类型，特别属于每次生育须进行交配和漫游甚广的那些纲，已经分别变得十分不同，足以列为代表物种。在此，若干代表物种和它们的共同祖先之间的中间变种，先前在这个地区的各个隔离部分内一定存在过，但是这些环节在自然选择的过程中都已淘汰灭绝，所以现今就看不到活体存在了。

第三，如有两个以上的变种在一个严密连续地域的不同部分形成，那很可能中间地带起先有中间变种形成，但是一般存在的时间不长。因为中间变种由于已经说过的理由（即由于我们所知道的亲缘密切的物种或代表物种的实际分布情形，以及公认的变种的实际分布情形），生存在中间地带的个体数量要比所连接的变种少。单从这种原因来看，中间变种就难免偶然灭绝；在通过自然选择进一步变异的过程中，它们几乎一定要被所连接的类型所压倒淘汰；因为这些类型的个体数量多，整体上有更多的变异，这样便能通过自然选择得到进一步的改进，而进一步扩大优势。

最后，不是看任何一个时期，而是看所有时期，如果我的学说正确，那无数中间变种肯定存在过，而把同群的全部物种密切连接起来；但是正如屡次说过的，自然选择这个过程，常常倾向于使亲类型和中间环节灭绝。结果，它们曾经存在的证明只能见于化石的遗物中，而这些化石的保存，如以后的一章里所要指出的，是极不完全而且间断的记载。




论具有特殊习性和构造的生物之起源和过渡。——反对我的意见的人曾经问道：比方说，陆栖食肉动物怎样能够转变成具有水栖习性的食肉动物？在过渡状态中怎么能生存？不难阐明，在同一个群中现今有许多食肉动物呈现着从严格的陆栖习性到水栖习性之间密切连接的中间各级；并且由于各自为求生而斗争，显然其习性很好适应于其在自然界所处的位置。试看北美洲的水貂（Mustela vison），脚有蹼，毛皮、短腿以及尾的形状都像水獭。在夏季这种动物潜水捕鱼为食，但在漫长的冬季离开冰冻的水，像鸡貂（polecats）一样，捕食家鼠和陆栖动物。如果用另一个例子来问：食虫的四足兽怎样能够转变成能飞的蝙蝠？这个问题要难得多，我将哑口无言。然而我想，这种难点无足轻重。

在这里，正如在其他场合，我处于严重不利的局面，因为从我搜集的许多惊人事例里，我只能举出一两个，来说明同属密切亲缘物种的过渡习性和构造，以及同一物种中无论恒久或暂时的多种习性。依我看，像蝙蝠这种特殊的情况，非把过渡状态的个案列成一张长表，就不足以减少其中的困难。

看一看松鼠科，这里的分级可谓细腻。从有的种类开始，其尾巴仅仅稍微扁平，还有一些种类，如理查森（J. Richardson）爵士所论述过的，其身体后部相当宽阔，两胁的皮膜相当丰满，直到所谓飞鼠；飞鼠的四肢甚至尾巴的基部，都由广阔的皮膜联结在一起，作用就像降落伞，可以在空中从这树滑翔到那树，距离之远实在惊人。不能怀疑，每一种构造对于每一种松鼠在其栖息的地区都各有用处，可以逃避食肉鸟兽，可以较快地采集食物，或者，有理由相信，可以减少偶然跌落的危险。然而，不能从这一事实就得出结论，每一种松鼠的构造在一切自然条件下都是所能想象的最佳构造。假设气候和植被变化了，假设与它竞争的其他啮齿类或新的食肉动物迁移进来了，旧有的食肉动物变异了，如此类推，会使我们相信，至少有些松鼠要减少数量或者灭绝，除非它们的构造也能相应变异改进，所以，特别是在变化着的生活条件下，那些肋旁皮膜越来越丰满的个体将继续保存下来，我看是不难的，它的每一变异都是有用的，都会传衍下去，这种自然选择过程的累积效果，终于会有一种完美的所谓飞鼠产生出来了。

现在看一看猫猴类（Galeopithecus）飞狐猴，先前曾错放在蝙蝠类中。它那肋旁极阔的皮膜，从额角起一直延伸到尾巴，把生着长指的四肢也包含在内了，皮膜还生有伸张肌。虽然还没有适于空中滑翔构造的各级环节把猫猴类与狐猴科联结起来，然而不难设想，这样的环节先前存在过，而且各自就以滑翔不完全的飞鼠那样的步骤形成，而各级构造对于它的所有者都有用处。我觉得也没有任何不能超越的难点来进一步相信，猫猴类膜连接的指头与前臂，由于自然选择而大大增长了；这一点，就飞翔器官来讲，就可以使那动物变成蝙蝠。在某些蝙蝠里，翼膜从肩端起一直延伸到尾巴，并且把后腿都包含在内，约莫可以看到一种原来适于滑翔而不适于飞翔的构造痕迹。

假如有十二个属左右的鸟类灭绝了或者不为人知，谁敢冒险推测，只把翅膀用作击水的一些鸟，如大头鸭（Micropterus of Eyton）；在水中把翅膀当作鳍用，在陆上当作前脚用的一些鸟，如企鹅；把翅膀当作风帆用的一些鸟，如鸵鸟；以及翅膀在机能上没有任何用处的一些鸟，如几维鸟（Apteryx），曾经存在过呢？然而上述每一种鸟的构造，在所处的生活条件下都是有用的，因为每一种都势必在斗争中求生存，但是并不一定在一切可能条件下都是最佳的。切勿从这些话去推论，这里所讲的各级翅膀的构造（大概都由于不使用的结果），都表示鸟类实际获得完全飞翔能力所经过的步骤；但是至少表示有多少多样化过渡方式是可能的。

看到像甲壳动物（Crustacea）和软体动物（Mollusca）这些水中呼吸动物的少数种类可以适应陆地生活；又看到飞鸟、飞兽，形形色色的飞虫，先前存在过的飞爬虫，就可以想象那些依靠鳍拍击而稍稍上升、旋转和在空中滑翔很远的飞鱼，是可以变为完全有翅膀的动物的。如果这种事情曾经发生，谁会想象到，它们在早先的过渡状态中是大洋里的居民呢？而且据我们所知，它们的初步飞翔器官是专门用来逃脱别种鱼的吞食的呢！

看到适应于任何特殊习性而达到高度完善的构造，如飞翔的鸟翅，我们必须记住，表现有早期过渡各级构造的动物很少会留到今日，而通过自然选择会被完善过程所淘汰。另外，我们可以断言，适于不同生活习性的构造之间的过渡状态，在早期很少大量发展，也很少具有许多从属的类型。这样，我们再回到假想的飞鱼例子，真正会飞的鱼，大概不是为了在陆上和水中用许多方法捕捉许多种类的食物，而在许多从属的类型里发展起来，直到飞翔器官达到高度完善的阶段，使得它们在生活斗争中相对于其他动物得到决定性的优势。因此，在化石状态中发现具有过渡各级构造的物种的机会总是不多的，因为个体数目少于那些构造上充分发达的物种。

现在我举两三个事例来说明同种个体间习性多样化和习性的改变。不论哪种情况下，自然选择都能轻易使动物改变构造适应其改变了的习性，或者专门适应若干习性中的一种。然而难以决定的是，究竟习性变化一般先于构造，还是构造的稍微变化引起了习性变化呢？大概两者往往同时发生的。但这些对于我们并不重要。关于习性改变的情形，只要举出现在许多英国昆虫专吃外来植物或人造食物就足够了。关于习性多样化，例子不胜枚举：我在南美洲常常观察霸鹟（Saurophagus sulphuratus）像茶隼（kestrel）似的盘旋来盘旋去，要么静静伫立在水边，然后像翠鸟（kingfisher）似的冲入水中捕鱼。在英国，有时可以看到大山雀（Parus major）几乎像旋木雀（creeper）似的攀行枝上，有时又像伯劳（shrike）似的啄小鸟的头部，把它们弄死。我好多次看见并且听到，它们像五子雀（nuthatch）似的在枝上啄食紫杉（yew）的种子。赫恩（Hearne）在北美洲看到黑熊大张其嘴在水里游泳数小时，像鲸鱼似的捕捉水中的昆虫。哪怕是如此极端的个案，如果昆虫供应源源不断，而且区域内没有更加适应环境的竞争者捷足先登，我看不难出现一个熊种族通过自然选择在构造和习性上越来越适应水族生活，嘴巴越来越大，直到产生鲸鱼一样的畸形动物。

由于我们有时候看到一些个体具有不同于同种和同属异种所固有的习性，依我看，我们可以预期这些个体偶尔会产生新种，具有异常的习性，而且构造上或多或少地改变原种的模式。自然界里是有这样的事例的。啄木鸟攀登树木并从树皮裂缝里捕捉昆虫，我们能够举出比这种适应性更加动人的例子吗？然而北美洲有些啄木鸟主要以果实为食，另有一些啄木鸟却生着长翅飞行捉捕昆虫。拉普拉塔平原没有生长一株树，那里有一种啄木鸟，在每一个基本体制上，甚至在羽色、粗糙的音调、波动式的飞翔，清清楚楚地告诉我其与英国普通啄木鸟的密切血缘关系；但是这种啄木鸟从来不爬树！

海燕（petrels）是最具空中性和海洋性的鸟，但是在恬静的火地海峡间有一种名叫水雉鸟（Puffinuria berardi）的，在一般习性上，在惊人的潜水力上，在游泳姿态和被迫起飞时的飞翔姿态上，任何人都会把它误为海雀（auk）或（grebe）的；尽管如此，它在本质上还是一种海燕，只是体制的许多部分已经起了深刻的变异。关于水鸫（water-ouzel），最敏锐的观察者根据尸体检验，也决不会想象到它有半水栖的习性；然而这种陆栖鸫科鸟的异数却以潜水为生——水中使用翅膀，两脚抓握石子。

有些人相信各种生物创造出来就像今日所看到的那样，他们遇到一种动物的习性与构造不相一致时，一定会大惊小怪。鹅鸭蹼脚的形成是为了游泳，还有什么更为明显的呢？然而产于高地的鹅，虽然生着蹼脚，却很少走近水边，除却奥杜邦（Audubon）外，没有人看见过四趾都有蹼的军舰鸟（frigate-bird）降落在海面上的。另一方面，和骨顶鸡（coots）都是显著的水栖鸟，但趾仅在边缘上生着膜。涉禽类（Grallatores）无膜长趾的形成，是为了便于在沼泽地和浮草上行走，还有更为明显的吗？可是美洲骨顶鸡（water-hen）几乎和骨顶鸡一样是水栖性的，而秧鸡（landrail）几乎和鹌鹑（quail）、鹧鸪（partridge）一样是陆栖性的。这些例子，可以举一反三，都是习性已经变化而构造并不相应变化。高地鹅的蹼脚在机能上可以说已经变得几乎是残迹了，虽然构造上并非如此。军舰鸟趾间深凹的膜，表明它的构造已开始变化了。

相信分别而无数次生物创造行为的人会说，这些例子里，造物主喜欢使一种模式的生物去代替别种模式的生物；但在我看来这只是巧言重复罢了。相信生存斗争和自然选择原理的人，则会承认各种生物都不断在努力增加个体数目，而任何生物无论在习性或构造上只要发生很小的变异，从而较同一地方的别种生物占便宜，就能攫取该生物的位置，不管与自己原来的位置有多大的不同。这样，也就不会感到奇怪了：具有蹼脚的鹅和军舰鸟生活于干燥的陆地，很少降落在水面上；具有长趾的秧鸡生活于草地、沼泽地上；啄木鸟生长在几乎没有树木的地方；鸫潜水，而海燕具有海雀的习性。




极端完善的和复杂的器官。——眼睛具有不能模仿的装置，可以对不同距离调节其焦点，接纳不同的光量，校正像差、色差。我坦承，设想眼睛能由自然选择而形成，好像是荒谬透顶。可是理性告诉我，若能明示从简单而不完全的眼睛到复杂而完全的眼睛之间有众多级差存在，并且每级对于它的所有者都有用处；若眼睛果然有细微变异，并且变异得到遗传，而这肯定是事实；若这些变异对于处在变化着的生活条件下的任何动物是有用的；那么，相信完善而复杂的眼睛能够由自然选择而形成的这个难点就不能当真，虽然在我们想象中这是难以克服的。神经怎样对光有感觉，正如生命本身是怎样起源的一样，不是我们研究的范围。但我可以指出，若干事实令我猜测，任何敏感的神经都能够变得感光，同时感觉到发出声音的那些空气的粗糙震荡。

探求任何物种的器官得以完善的分级，应当专门观察它的直系祖先；但这几乎不可能，于是便不得不每次去观察同群的物种，即观察共同始祖类型的旁系后代，以便看出有哪些分级是可能的，也许还有机会看出早期遗传下来的不改变或小改变的某些分级。在现存的脊椎动物里，我们仅找到极少量的眼睛构造分级，从化石物种上也了解不到什么。在脊椎动物大纲内，也许得深入地层，到达已知最低的化石层，才能发现那些眼睛完善的早期阶段。

在关节动物（Articulata）这一大纲里，起初是单纯色素层包围着的视神经，没有任何视觉机制。从这个低级阶段，可以证明存在着大量构造分级，以两条根本不同的线路分叉，直到比较完善的高级阶段。例如，某些甲壳纲具有双角膜，内角膜分成若干眼面，其中都有透镜形状的隆起。其他甲壳纲的透明视锥包围着色素，其正常行为仅仅是排除测光线锥，上端呈凸面，必须做会聚动作，而下端似乎有一个不完善的玻璃体。这里的事实陈述实在过于简短不全，却表明了现存甲壳纲眼睛存在非常多样化的分级。考虑到现存动物相对于灭绝动物来说数量极少，我看（相对于许多其他构造来说）不会特别难以相信，自然选择已经把区区色素层包围着的、透明膜遮盖着的简单视神经装置，变成了关节动物大纲里任何动物都具有的完善视觉器官了。

已经走到此处的人，如果读完本书之后，发现其中的大量事实别法无解，通过遗传学说却得到了解释，就应当进一步勇往直前，承认连鹰眼那样完善的构造也可能是自然选择形成的，虽然还并不知道过渡分级。理性应该战胜妄想；但我痛感困难之大，若有人不愿把自然选择原理扩展到这种惊人的程度，我并不奇怪。

不把眼睛比作望远镜简直不可能。我们知道望远镜是由人类的最高智者经过锲而不舍的努力而完善的，自然会推论眼睛也是通过差不多的过程而形成的。但这种推论难道不自以为是吗？我们有权去假定造物主是以人类那样的智力来工作的吗？如果必须把眼睛比作光学器具，就应当想象，有厚层的透明组织，底下有感光的神经，然后假定这一厚层内各部分缓慢而持续地改变密度，以便分离成不同密度和厚度的各层，彼此距离各不相同，各层的表面也慢慢地改变着形状。进而必须假定有一种力量，时刻密切注意着各透明层的每个轻微的偶然改变；并且根据变化的环境，仔细选择无论以任何方式或任何程度产生较明晰影像的每一个变异。必须假定，该器官的每一种新状态，都是成百万地倍增着；每种状态要一直保存到更好的状态产生出来，然后旧的状态灰飞烟灭。在生物体里，变异会引起一些轻微的改变，生殖作用会使这些改变几乎无限地倍增着，而自然选择以准确的技巧挑选每一次的改进。让这种过程成百万年地进行着；每年作用于成百万的多种类个体；难道我们不相信，这种活的光学器具会比玻璃器具制造得更好，正如造物主的工作比人做得更好吗？

若能证明有任何复杂器官不可能经过无数的、连续的、轻微的变异而形成，我的理论就要完全破产。但是我没有发现这种情形。无疑有许多器官，我们不知道其过渡诸级，考虑到那些孤立的物种就更加如此，因为根据我的理论，周围的类型已大都灭绝了。还有，考虑到一个大纲内所有成员共有的一种器官，想必是遥远的时代里形成的，此后，本纲内一切成员才发展起来，为要找寻那器官早先经过的过渡诸级，我们必须观察极古的始祖类型，可是这些类型早已灭绝了。

我们必须极端慎言一种器官不可能通过某种过渡级而形成。低等动物里，可以举出大量例子来说明同样的器官同时能够进行全然不同的机能；如蜻蜓的幼虫和泥鳅（Cobites），消化管兼营呼吸、消化和排泄的机能。再如水螅（Hydra）可以把身体的内部翻出来，然后外层就营消化，而胃部就营呼吸了。此时，如果可以得到任何利益的话，自然选择可以轻易使本来营两种机能的部分或器官专营一种机能，于是以不知不觉的步骤，器官的性质就整体改变了。两种不同的器官，有时候同时在同一个体里营相同的机能；举一个例子——鱼类用鳃呼吸溶解在水中的空气，同时用鳔呼吸游离的空气，鳔被富有血管的隔膜分开，并有鳔管（ductus pneumaticus）供给它空气。此时，两种器官当中的一个可轻易地改变和完善，以单独担当全部的工作，在变异的过程中，可受到另一种器官的帮助；于是另一种器官可能为着完全不同的另一目的而改变，或者可能被消灭掉。

鱼鳔是一个好例证，明确地向我们阐明了一个重要的事实：本来为了一种目的——漂浮而构成的器官，可转变成极其不同目的——呼吸器官。在某些鱼类里，鳔又为听觉器官的一种补助器，或者说听觉器官的一部分已经充当鳔的补充器，我不知道哪种观点现在占上风。所有生理学者都承认鳔在位置和构造上与高等脊椎动物的肺是同源的或是“理想地相似”：因此，似乎可以轻易认为，自然选择实际上已经把鳔变成了肺，即专营呼吸的器官。

我不怀疑，一切具有真肺的脊椎动物是从具有漂浮器即鳔的古代未知原始型一代一代传下来的。这样，正如我根据欧文教授关于这些器官的有趣描述推论出来的，就可以理解一个奇怪的现象，我们咽下去的每一点食物和饮料都必须经过气管上的小孔，虽然有一种美妙的装置可以使声门紧闭，但还有落入肺部的危险。高等脊椎动物已经完全失去了鳃——但在胚胎里，颈两旁的裂缝和弯弓形的动脉仍然标志着鳃的先前位置。不过可以想象，现今完全失掉的鳃，大概被自然选择逐渐利用于某一不同的目的；同样，根据某些学者的观点，环节动物（Annelids）的鳃和背鳞，与昆虫的翅膀和鞘翅是同源的；所以，古时候一度用作呼吸的器官，实际上非常可能已转变成飞翔器官了。

考察器官的过渡时必须记住一种机能有转变成另一种机能的可能性，所以我要再举一个例子。有柄蔓足类有两个很小的皮折，我把它叫作保卵系带，用分泌黏液的方法把卵维系在一起，直到卵在袋中孵化。这种蔓足类没有鳃，全身表皮和卵袋表皮以及小保卵系带都营呼吸。藤壶科即无柄蔓足类则不然，没有保卵系带，卵松散地置于袋底，外面包以紧闭的壳；却生有巨大的褶皱鳃。我想，现在没有人会争议，这一科里的保卵系带与别科里的鳃是严格同源的；实际上是彼此逐渐转化的。所以，毋庸怀疑，原来作为系带的同时也轻度帮助呼吸作用的那两个小皮折，已经通过自然选择，仅仅由于尺寸增大和黏液腺的消失，就转变成鳃了。如果一切有柄蔓足类都已灭绝，因其所遭到的灭绝远较无柄蔓足类为甚，谁能想到无柄蔓足类里的鳃原本是用来防止卵被冲出袋外的器官呢？

虽然我们必须极端慎言任何器官不可能由连续的、过渡的分级所产生，可是无疑还有严重的难点。有些难点容后面著书讨论。

最大的难点之一是中性昆虫，其构造常与雄虫和能育的雌虫大有不同；这个个案将在下章讨论。鱼的发电器官是另一种特别难解的个案；无法想象这等奇异的器官是经过什么步骤产生的。但欧文等人说得对，这些器官和普通的肌肉之间，在内部构造上是密切类似的。最近有人证明，鳐（Ray）有一个器官密切类似于发电装置，但按照玛得希（Matteuchi）的观察，并不放电。所以我们必须承认，自己实在是无知得很，无权主张任何的过渡都不可能有。

发电器官是另一种更大的难点；因为只见于约十二种鱼类的身上，其中有几个种类在亲缘关系上是相距很远的。如果同样的器官见于同一纲中的若干成员，特别是这些成员具有很不相同的生活习性时，一般可以将其存在归因于共同祖先的遗传，把某些成员不具有这器官归因于通过不使用或自然选择而招致的丧失。但假如发电器官是从这样规定的唯一古代祖先遗传下来的，就可以期望一切电鱼彼此都有特殊的亲缘关系。地质学也完全不能令人相信大多数鱼类先前有过发电器官，而变异了的后代大都已经将其失掉。属于不同科目的几种昆虫里发现的发光器官，是相等的难点。还有其他个案，例如在植物里，花粉块生在端头具有黏液腺的柄上，这种很奇妙的装置，在红门兰属（Orchis）和马利筋属（Asclepias）上是一样的，但它们在显花植物中几乎是相距最远的属。在不同物种呈现看起来相同的异常器官的所有这些个案中，应该指出，尽管器官的一般外表和机能一模一样，但一般能探测到根本性的差别。我倾向于认为，就像两个人有时候会独立地得到同一个发明一样，自然选择为了各生物的利益而工作着，利用着相似的变异，而在两个生物里，有时候以相似方式改变了两个部分，所以其共同构造并不能归因于共同祖先的遗传。

虽然在许多情况下，要猜测器官经过什么样的过渡形式而达到今日的状态是极其困难的，但是考虑到生存的已知类型与灭绝的未知类型相比，数量极少，我感到惊异的，倒是很难举出一个器官不是经过过渡分级而形成的。此话的正确性有博物学史那古老的格言“自然界里没有飞跃”为证。有经验的学者的著作几乎都承认这句格言；米尔恩·爱德华兹说得好，自然界在玩花样方面挥霍，却在创新方面吝啬。如果依据神创论，为什么这样呢？许多独立生物既然是分别创造以适合于自然界的一定位置，为什么它们的所有部分和器官，却这样始终如一地被逐渐分级的步骤连接在一起呢？为什么自然界不采取从构造到构造的飞跃呢？依照自然选择的学说，就能够明白自然界为什么这样；因为自然选择只是利用微细的、连续的变异而发生作用；从来不可能采取飞跃，而一定是以最短最缓慢的步骤前进。




表面上不重要的器官。——自然选择是通过生死存亡——让具有任何有利变异的个体生存，让具有任何不利构造变异的个体灭亡——而发生作用的，所以对于次要简单部分的起源，我有时感到很难理解，因为似乎不足以让连续变异的个体生存啊。对于完美复杂器官如眼睛的个案，这方面我有时候也感到费解，虽然这是一种很不相同的困难。

第一，我们对于任何一种生物的全部机构太无知，说不出什么样的轻微变异重要与否。上一章举出过微细性状的一些事例，如果实上的茸毛，果肉的颜色，决定了昆虫是否来攻击，或与体质的差异相关，确实会承受自然选择的作用。长颈鹿的尾巴，宛如人造的蝇拂；说它适于现在的用途是经过连续的微细变异，每次变异都更适合驱蝇那样的琐事，初看来似乎难以置信。然而哪怕这种情况下，断言之前亦应三思；我们知道，在南美洲，牛和其他动物的分布和生存绝对取决于抗拒昆虫攻击的力量：好歹只要能防这等小敌害的个体，就能扩张到新牧场，获得巨大优势。倒不是大个的四足兽真的会被苍蝇消灭（除了少数的例外），而是不断骚扰会导致其体力降低，容易得病，有饥荒来袭时无力觅食，无力逃避猛兽攻击。

现在不重要的器官，也许在某些情形里，对于早期的祖先是高度重要的，器官在以前的一个时期慢慢完善了之后，仍以近乎相同的状态传递下来，但现在已经用处极少了；构造上任何实际的有害偏差，总要受到自然选择的抑制。看到尾巴在大多数水栖动物里是何等重要的运动器官，大概就可以这样去解释它在多数陆栖动物（肺或变异了的鳔揭示了它们的水栖起源）里的一般存在和多种用途。充分发达的尾巴一旦在水栖动物里形成，其后它大概可以培养各种各样的用途，如作为蝇拂，作为握持器官，或者像狗尾那样帮助转弯，虽然转弯助力想必不大，野兔没有尾巴，照样迅速调头。

第二，我们有时很重视实际上无足轻重的性状，它们来自次等的原因，跟自然选择无关。应该记住，气候、食物等等也许对体制没有直接影响，性状复现是由于返祖法则，相关生长在改变各种构造中影响巨大，最后，性选择常常明显改变有意志动物的外在性状，让一个雄性得到与另一个雄性打斗或者吸引异性的优点。而且，构造变异主要来自上述或者其他未知原因时，起初对于物种可能并没有什么利益，此后却会被后代在新的生活条件下和新获得的习性里所利用。

举例说明上面最后的话。如果只有绿色的啄木鸟生存着，就不知道还有许多种黑色和杂色的啄木鸟，我敢说我们一定会以为绿色是一种美妙的适应，使这种频繁往来于树木之间的鸟类得以在敌害面前隐蔽自己；结果就会认为这是一种重要的性状，并且是通过自然选择而获得的；其实毋庸置疑这颜色出于截然不同的原因，也许是来自性选择。马来群岛有一种藤棕榈（trailing bamboo），依靠丛生在枝端的构造精致的钩，攀缘最高的树木，这种装置对于这植物无疑是极有用处的；但是我们在许多非攀缘性的树上也看到极相似的钩，所以藤棕榈的钩最初可能来自未知的生长法则，后来当该植物进一步发生变异，成为攀缘植物的时候，钩就被利用了。秃鹫（vulture）头上裸出的皮，普遍被认为是为了吞食腐败物的一种直接适应；也许是这样，也许可能是由于腐败物质的直接作用；但是当我们看到吃清洁食物的雄火鸡头皮也这样裸出时，就要慎于做任何这样的推论。幼小哺乳动物头骨上的缝被认为是帮助产出的美妙适应而改进，毫无疑问，这能使生产容易，也许这是为生产所必需的；但是，幼小的鸟类和爬行动物只要从破裂蛋壳里爬出来，头骨也有缝，所以我们可以推想这种构造的发生来自生长法则，不过高等动物把它利用在生产上罢了。

对于轻微次要变异的原因，我们一无所知；考虑到各地家养动物品种间的差异——特别是在文明较低的国家里，那里还极少人工选择——就会立刻意识到这一点。某些仔细观察者相信潮湿气候会影响毛的生长，而角又与毛相关。高山品种总是与低地品种有差异；山区大概对后腿有锻炼，甚至影响骨盆的形状；于是，根据同源变异的法则，前肢和头部大概也要受到影响。还有，骨盆的形状可能因压力而影响子宫里小牛脑袋的形状。高原地区需费力呼吸，我们有理由相信，可使胸部增大；而且相关作用又有效力。各地未开化人所养育的动物还常常要为自己的生存而斗争，并且在某种程度上是暴露在自然选择作用之下的，同时体质稍微不同的个体，在不同的气候下最容易得到成功。有理由相信，体质和体色相关。观察者还说，牛对于蝇的攻击的感受性与体色相关，被某些植物毒倒的易感性也是这样；所以颜色也是这样服从自然选择的作用的。但是我们实在太无知了，无法对于变异的若干已知未知原因的相对重要性加以思辨；我这里提到它们，只在于表明，尽管一般都承认家养品种经过寻常的世代而产生，我们却不能解释它们性状差异的原因，既然如此，我们对于物种之间的微小相似差异，还不能了解其真实原因，就不必耿耿于怀了。我为了同样的目的，可以引证人种之间的差别，标记鲜明。还可以补充说明这些差别的来源，主要是通过某种性选择。但这里无法铺开浩瀚的细节，推理未免显得浅尝辄止。

最近有学者反对功利说所主张的构造每一细微之点的产生都是为了所有者的利益，前节的论点促使我对这种反调说几句。他们相信许多构造创造出来，是为了人类眼里的美，或仅仅为了多样化。这个说教如果正确，对我的学说就是致命的。我完全承认，有许多构造对于所有者没有直接用处。外界条件对于构造也许有一点点作用，与由此而获得的利益都不相干。相关生长无疑起了十分重要的作用，一个部分的有用变异往往引起其他部分产生没有直接用处的多样性变化。还有以前有用的性状，或者以前来自相关生长的性状，或者来自未知原因的性状，会因为返祖法则而重新出现，尽管现在已经没有用处。性选择的作用体现为吸引雌性的美，只可颇为勉强地称为有用。但是最最重要的一点理由是，各种生物的体制的主要部分都是由遗传而来的；结果，虽然每一生物确是适于它在自然界中的位置，但是有许多构造与物种的生活习性并没有直接的关系。例如，我们很难相信，高地鹅和军舰鸟的蹼脚对于它们有什么特别的用处；我们不能相信在猴子的臂内、马的前腿内、蝙蝠的翅膀内、海豹的鳍脚内，相似的骨对于这些动物有什么特别的用处。我们可以很稳妥地把这些构造归因于遗传。但是蹼脚对于高地鹅和军舰鸟的祖先无疑是有用的，正如对于现存的水栖鸟一样。所以我们可以相信，海豹的祖先并不生有鳍脚，却生有五个趾的脚，适于走或抓握；我们还可以进一步大胆相信：猴子、马和蝙蝠的四肢内的若干骨头，从共同祖先遗传而来，以前是那个祖先或者祖先的祖先们专用的，而不是供现在习性多样化的这些动物使用。因此我们可以推论，这若干骨头可能是通过自然选择获得的，过去和现在一样，受制于各种遗传、返祖、相关生长等法则。因此，所有生物的所有构造细节（给外界条件的直接作用留一些余地）可以看作为某个祖先类型所专用，或者现在为该类型的后代所专用——要么直接，要么通过复杂的生长法则间接进行。

自然选择不可能使一个物种产生出唯独对另一个物种有利的任何变异；虽然在整个自然界中，一个物种不断地利用另一物种的构造而获益。不过，自然选择能够而且的确常常产生出直接对别种动物有害的构造，如蝮蛇的毒牙，姬蜂的产卵管能够在别种活昆虫的身体里产卵。假如能够证明，任何一个物种的构造的任何一部分全然为了另一物种的利益而形成，那就要推翻我的理论了，因为这构造是不能通过自然选择产生的。虽然博物学著作里有许多陈述提到该事，但找不到一句话看起来是有分量的。尽管响尾蛇的毒牙系用以自卫和杀害猎物，但某些作者假定它同时具有于自己不利的响器，会预先警告猎物躲避。我恨不得认为，猫准备纵跳时卷动尾端是为了使大祸临头的鼠警戒起来。但这里限于篇幅，无法详述。

自然选择从来不使一种生物产生损害自己的任何构造，唯有根据各种生物的利益并且为了它们的利益而起作用。正如帕利（Paley）说过的，没有一种器官的形成是为了给予它的所有者以痛苦或损害。如果公平权衡各个部分所引起的利和害，就可以看到，从整体来说，各个部分都是有利的。随着时间的推移，生活条件改变，如果任何部分变为有害的，那就要变异；否则这种生物就要灭绝，如灭绝了的大部队那样。

自然选择只是倾向于使每一种生物跟共栖息地、被迫进行生存斗争的别种生物一样地完善，或者稍微更加完善一些。我们可以看到，这就是自然状况下所得到的完善程度。例如，新西兰的土著生物彼此相比都是完善的，但是在欧洲引进的动植物大军压境面前，正在迅速屈服。自然选择不会产生绝对的完善，并且就我们所能判断的来说，也不总是在自然界里遇见这种高标准。据权威说，光线像差的校正，甚至在最完善的器官眼睛里，也不是完全的。如果理性促使我们热烈地赞美自然界里有无数不能模仿的装置，那么它又告诉我们说（纵然我们在两方面都易犯错），某些其他装置不那么完善。我们能够认为蜜蜂的螫针是完善的吗？对付多种敌害的时候，螫针有倒生的小锯齿无法自拔，这样，自己的内脏就被拉出，不可避免地要引起蜜蜂的死亡。

如果把蜜蜂的螫针看作在遥远的祖先里已经存在，原是穿孔用的锯齿状器具，就像这个大目里的许多成员那样，后来为了现在的目的被改变了，但没有完善，而它的毒素原本是适于产生树瘿，后来才强化，我们就大概能够理解，为什么蜜蜂一用螫针就往往引起自身死亡：如果螫针的能力总体上对于蜂群有用处，虽然可以引起少数成员的死亡，却可以满足自然选择的一切要求。如果我们赞叹许多昆虫中的雄虫依靠嗅觉的神奇能力去寻找雌虫，那么，也赞叹只为了这个目的而产生万千雄蜂，对于蜂群没有一点其他用处，终于被那些勤劳而不育的姊妹弄死吗？也许是难以赞叹的，但是应当赞叹蜂后的野蛮本能的恨，促使它在幼小的蜂后女儿们刚生出来就瞬间将其弄死，或者自己在这场战斗中死亡；因为没有疑问，这对于蜂群是有好处的；母爱或母恨（幸而后者很少），对于自然选择的不可抗拒原则来说是一视同仁。如果我们赞叹兰科植物和许多其他植物的几种巧妙装置，通过昆虫的助力来受精，那么赤松精致的花粉雾，让少数几粒能够碰巧吹到胚珠上去，我们能够认为同等完善吗？




本章提要。——这一章讨论了可以用来反对我的理论的一些难点和异议。其中有许多是严重的；但是，我想在这里对于一些事实已经澄清说明，而依照特创论的信条，这些事实是一塌糊涂。我们已经看到，物种在任何一个时期的变异都不是无限的，也没有由无数的中间分级联系起来，部分原因是自然选择的过程总是极其缓慢的，在任何一个时期只对少数类型发生作用，部分原因是自然选择这一过程本身就意味着先驱的中间级不断淘汰灭绝。现今生存于连续地域上的亲缘密切的物种，往往在这个地域还没有连续起来、生活条件还没有从这一处不知不觉地逐渐变化到另一处的时候，就已经形成了。当两个变种在连续地域的两处形成的时候，常有适于中间地带的中间变种形成；但依照上述的理由，中间变种的个体数量通常要比所连接的两个变种少；结果，这两个变种进一步变异的过程中，由于个体数量较多，便比数量少的中间变种占有强大的优势，因此，一般就会成功地把中间变种淘汰消灭掉。

我们在本章里已经看到，应该特别慎言极其不同的生活习性不能逐渐彼此转化；譬如断言蝙蝠不能通过自然选择从一种最初只在空中滑翔的动物形成。

我们已经看到，一个物种在新的生活条件下可以改变习性，或者有多样化的习性，其中有些和最近同类很不相同。因此，只要记住各生物都在试图生活于任何可以生活的地方，我们就能理解脚上有蹼的高地鹅、栖居地上的啄木鸟、潜水的鸫和具有海雀习性的海燕是怎样产生的了。

像眼睛那样完善的器官，要说能够由自然选择形成，这足以使任何人震惊；但是不论何种器官，只要我们知道其一系列复杂、逐渐过渡的分级，各个对于所有者都有益处，在改变着的生活条件下，通过自然选择而达到任何可以想象的完善程度，在逻辑上并非不可能。在不知道有中间状态或过渡状态的情形里，必须极端慎言不能有这些状态曾经存在过，因为许多器官的同源和中间状态阐明了，机能上的奇异变化至少是可能的。例如，鳔显然已经转变成呼吸空气的肺了。同时进行多种不同机能的、然后变为专营一种机能的同一器官，同时进行同种机能的、一种器官受到另一种器官的帮助而完善的两种不同器官，一定常常会大大促进过渡。

在大多数情形里，我们实在太无知无识了，居然主张任何部分或器官对于物种的利益极其不重要，所以其构造上的变异，不可能由自然选择缓缓累积起来。但我们满可以认为，许多变异完全是生长法则带来的，起初对物种没有任何利益，但后来被进一步变异的后代所利用。我们还可以相信，从前高度重要的部分，虽然已变得不重要，在目前状态下，已不可能由自然选择而获得，但往往还会保留着（如水栖动物的尾巴仍然保留在陆栖后代里）。自然选择的力量仅仅通过保留生存斗争中出现的有利变异而起作用。

自然选择不会在一个物种里产生出唯独有利于或者有害于另一个物种的任何东西；虽然能够有效地产生出对于另一物种极其有用的，甚至不可缺少的或者极其有害的部分、器官和分泌物，但是在所有情形里同时也是对它们的所有者有用的。在生物繁生的各个地方，自然选择必须主要通过生物的相互竞争而发生作用，于是，只是依照这个地方的标准产生完美，在生存战斗中产生力量。因此，一个地方，通常是较小地方的生物，常常屈服于另一个地方，通常是较大地方的生物，这一点我们有证据。在大的地方，有比较多的个体和比较多样化的类型存在，竞争比较剧烈，完善的标准也就比较高。自然选择不一定能导致绝对的完善；依照我们的有限才能来判断，绝对的完善也不是随处可见的。

依据自然选择学说，我们能明白博物学里“自然界里没有飞跃”这个老格言的充分意义。如果只看世界上的现存生物，这格言并不是严格正确的；但如果把过去的一切生物都包括在内，这格言按照我的理论必定是严格正确的。

一般公认，全部生物都是依照两大法则形成的——“模式统一”和“生存条件”。模式统一是指同纲生物与生活习性无关的构造上基本一致而言。依照我的理论，模式的统一可以用世系的统一来解释。曾被著名的居维叶所经常坚持的生存条件的说法，完全可以包括在自然选择的原理之内。因为自然选择的作用在于使各生物的变异部分现今适用于有机和无机的生存条件，或者在于使它们在过去的时代里如此去适应：在某些情况下，适应受到用或废的帮助，稍微受到外界生活条件的直接作用的影响，并且在一切场合里受制于生长变异的若干法则。事实上，生存条件法则是高级法则；因为通过遗传以前的变异，包括了模式统一法则。

本能与习性可比，但起源不同——本能的分级——蚜虫和蚁——本能是变异的——家养的本能，其起源——杜鹃、鸵鸟以及寄生蜂的自然本能——蓄奴蚁——蜜蜂，营造蜂房的本能——自然选择学说应用于本能的难点——中性或不育的昆虫——提要

本能问题原本可以纳入前面的章节。但我想，单独讨论比较方便，尤其是蜜蜂筑巢的本能是如此奇妙，在许多读者看来大概是一个足以推翻我的全部学说的难点。我先要声明一点，就是我不准备讨论智力的起源，就如我未曾讨论生命本身的起源一样。我们所要讨论的，只是同纲动物中本能的多样性，以及其他精神品质的多样性。

我并不想给本能下任何定义。容易阐明，这一术语通常包含着若干不同的精神活动；但是，说本能促使杜鹃迁徙并把蛋下在别种鸟巢里，每一个人都知道这是什么意义。我们自己需要经验才能完成的一种活动，而被一种没有经验的动物，特别是被幼小动物所完成，并且许多个体并不知道为了什么目的却按照同一方式去完成时，一般就称为本能。但是我能阐明，这些性状没有一个是普遍的。如于贝尔（Pierre Huber）所说的，甚至在自然系统中低级的动物里，小量的判断或理性也常发生作用。

弗·居维叶（Frederick Cuvier）等老一辈玄学者曾把本能与习性加以比较。我想，这一比较对于完成本能活动时的心理状态，提供了精确的概念，但不一定涉及它的起源。许多习惯性活动是在无意识下进行的，甚至不少直接与我们有意识的意志相反！然而意志和理性可以改变它们。习性容易与其他习性，与一定的时期，与身体的状态相联系。习性一经获得，常常终生保持不变。还可以指出本能和习性之间的其他若干类似点。有如反复歌唱一首名曲，在本能里也是一种活动有节奏地随着另一活动；如果一个人歌唱时，或在反复背诵东西时被打断了，一般地他就被迫走回头路，恢复已经成为习惯的思路。于贝尔发现能制造很复杂茧床的毛毛虫（caterpillar）就是如此；如果在完成构造第六阶段时把它抓出，放在只完成构造第三阶段的茧床里，这个毛毛虫仅重筑第四、第五、第六个阶段的构造。然而，如果把完成构造第三阶段的毛毛虫，放在已完成构造第六阶段的茧床里，那么工作已大都完成了，可是它并没有从中感到受益，反而不知所措，并且为了完成茧床，它似乎不得不从构造第三阶段开始，它是在这里放下的，就这样试图去完成已经完成了的工作。

假定任何习惯性的活动被遗传——可以指出，有时确有这种情形发生——那么原为习性和原为本能之间，就变得密切相似，难分难解。如果莫扎特不是在三岁时经过极少的练习就能弹奏钢琴，而是全然没有练习就能弹奏一曲，那么可以说他的弹奏确实是出于本能的了。但是假定大多数本能是由一个世代中的习性得来的，然后遗传给后继世代，则是大错特错。能够清楚表明，我们所熟知的最奇异的本能，如蜜蜂和许多蚁的本能，不可能是由习性得来的。

人们普遍承认，本能对于各个物种在现今生活条件之下的利益，有如肉体构造一样重要。在多变的生活条件下，本能的微小变异有利于物种，至少是可能的；如果能够指出，本能确曾发生过些许变异，我看自然选择就不难把本能的变异保存下来并继续累积到任何有利的程度。我相信，一切最复杂的和奇异的本能就是这样起源的。使用或习性引起肉体构造的变异，并使之增强，而不使用使之缩小或消失，我并不怀疑本能也是这样的。但我认为，习性的效果，同所谓本能偶发变异的自然选择效果相比是次要的。也就是，产生身体构造的微小偏差有一些未知原因，也产生变异，叫本能偶发变异。

除非经过有益的变异积少成多，缓慢而逐渐的积累，否则复杂的本能不可能通过自然选择而产生。因此，像身体构造的情形一样，我们在自然界中所寻求的不应是获得每一复杂本能的实际过渡诸级，这些只有在各物种的直系祖先里才能找到，但应当从旁系世系里去寻求这些分级的蛛丝马迹，至少能够指出某种分级是可能的；而这一点肯定能够办到。考虑到除了欧洲北美洲以外，动物本能还极少被观察过，并且灭绝物种的本能更是一无所知，我感到惊异的是，最复杂本能所赖以完成的分级能够广泛被发现。“自然界里没有飞跃”的准则适用于本能的力度不亚于身体器官。同一物种在生命的不同时期或一年中的不同季节，或处于不同的环境条件下等等而具有不同的本能，这就往往会促进本能的变化；在这种情况下，自然选择会把这种或那种本能保存下来。可以证明，同一物种中本能的多样性在自然界中也是存在的。

还有，像身体构造那样，各物种的本能都是为了自己的利益，据我们所能判断的，它从来没有为了其他物种的独享利益而产生过，这和我的理论也是符合的。我知道一个极有力的事例，一种动物的活动从表面看来完全是为了别种动物的利益，这就是蚜虫自愿把甜的分泌物供给蚂蚁：这样做是出于自愿，可由下列事实来说明。我把羊蹄酸模（dock-plant）上的所有蚂蚁从十来只蚜虫堆里搬走，数小时内不让回来。过了这段时间，我确实觉得蚜虫要进行分泌了。我用放大镜观察了一些时候，没有一个分泌的，于是，我尽力模仿蚂蚁用触角的样子，用一根毛轻轻地触动抚摩，但还没有一只蚜虫分泌。随后我让一只蚂蚁去接近它们，从它热切跑动的样子看来，它好像立刻觉得发现了丰盛的食物；于是用触角去拨蚜虫的腹部，先是这一只，然后那一只；蚜虫一接触到触角，即刻举起腹部，分泌出一滴澄清的甜液，蚂蚁慌忙吞食了。甚至十分幼小的蚜虫也有这样的动作，可见这种活动是本能，而不是经验所致。但是，排泄物极黏，被取去也许对于蚜虫是便利的，所以分泌本能大概不是专为蚂蚁的利益。虽然我不相信世界上任何动物会为了其他物种的独享利益而从事活动，然而各物种却试图利用其他物种的本能，正像利用其他物种的虚弱身体构造一样。这样，某些本能就不能看作是绝对完善的；但是详细讨论这一点以及其他类似之点，并非必不可少，所以这里就不赘述了。

本能在自然状态下有某种程度的变异以及这些变异的遗传，既然是自然选择的作用所不可少的，那就应该尽量举出许多事例来，但是篇幅限制，无法这样做。我只能断言，本能确实是变异的——例如迁徙的本能，不但在范围和方向上能变异，而且也会完全消失。鸟巢也是如此，变异部分发生于对选定的位置以及居住地性质和气温的依赖度，但常常由于全然未知的原因而发生变异。奥杜邦曾举出几个显著的例子，说明美国北方和南方同一物种的鸟巢有所不同。对于敌害的恐惧必然是一种本能品质，从未离巢的雏鸟身上可以看到，但这种恐惧可由经验或因看见其他动物对于同一敌害的恐惧而强化。对于人类的恐惧，如我在他处指出的，栖息在荒岛上的各种动物是慢慢获得的。甚至英国也可以看到这样的事例，即一切大型鸟比小型鸟更怕人，因为更多地遭受过人的迫害。英国的大型鸟更怕人，可以稳妥地归于这个原因；在无人岛，大型鸟并不比小型鸟更怕人；喜鹊（magpie）在英国很警惕，但在挪威却很驯顺，埃及的羽冠乌鸦（hooded crow）也是不怕人的。

有许多事实可以证明，自然状态下产生的同类动物的脾气极多样化。还有若干个案可以举出，表明某些物种偶发的奇特习性若对这个物种有利，就会通过自然选择产生新的本能。但我十分清楚，泛泛而谈，没有详细的事实，在读者的心目中只会当耳旁风。我只好重复保证，不说没有可靠证据的话。

简略考察一下家养的若干例子，则自然状态下本能遗传变异的可能性将加强，甚至出现大的可能性。由此可见习性和所谓偶发变异的选择，在改变家养动物精神品质上分别发生的作用。有许多奇异而真实的例子可以说明，与某种心境或某一时期有关的各种不同脾气嗜好以及怪癖都是遗传的。但是让我们看看众所熟知的几种狗的例子。毫无疑问，幼小的指示犬第一次带出去，有时就能够指示猎物的所在，甚至能够援助别的狗（我曾亲见这动人的情形）；寻回犬（retriever）确实在某种程度上可以把寻回的特性遗传下去；牧羊犬并不跑在羊群之内，而有在羊群周围环跑的倾向。幼小动物不依靠经验而有这些活动，同时各个体又差不多以同一方式进行，并且都欣然且不知道目的地去进行——幼小的指示犬并不知道指示方向是在帮助主人，有如白蝴蝶并不知道为什么要在圆白菜叶子上产卵一样——我无法看出这些活动在本质上与真正的本能有什么区别。如果看见一种狼，在幼小而且没有受过任何训练时，一旦嗅出猎物，先站着一动不动，随后又用特别的步法慢慢爬过去；又看见另一种狼环绕鹿群追逐，却不直冲，以便把鹿赶到远的地点去，必然要把这活动叫作本能。所谓家养下的本能，的确远不及自然的本能那么固定；但是其所蒙受的选择作用也极不严格，而且是在较不固定的生活条件下，在无比短暂的时间内传递下来的。

不同品种的狗进行杂交时，即能很好地看出这家养下的本能、习性以及脾气的遗传性是何等强烈，并且混合得多么奇妙。例如众所周知，长驱跑狗与斗牛狗杂交，可影响勇敢性和顽强性至许多世代；牧羊犬与长驱跑狗杂交，则使全族都得到捕捉野兔的倾向。这家养下的本能，如用上述杂交方法来试验，是与自然的本能相类似的；自然的本能也按照同样的方式奇异地混合在一起，而且长期表现出其祖代任何一方的本能的痕迹。例如，勒鲁瓦（Le Roy）描述过一条狗，曾祖父是狼；它只有一点表示了野生祖先的痕迹，即呼唤它时，不是直线走向主人。

家养下的本能有时被说成为完全由长期的强迫养成的习性所遗传下来的动作，我看这是不正确的。从未有人会想象去教或者曾经教过翻飞鸽去翻飞——据我所见到的，幼鸽从不曾见过鸽的翻飞，却会翻飞。我们相信，曾经有过一只鸽子表现了这种奇怪习性的微小倾向，并且在连续的世代中，经过对最好的个体的长期选择，才造成像今日那样的翻飞鸽；据布伦特（Brent）先生说，格拉斯哥附近的家养翻飞鸽，一飞到十八英寸高就要翻筋斗。假如未曾有过一只狗自然具有指示方向的倾向，是否会有人想到训练狗去指示方向是存疑的；人们知道这种倾向有时会出现，我就看见过一次，见于纯种的里。指示方向的最初倾向一旦出现，此后在每一世代中有计划选择和强迫训练的遗传效果，将会很快大功告成；而且无意识选择至今仍在继续进行，每一个人虽然本意不在改进品种，但总试图获得最善于指示方向和狩猎的狗。另一方面，在某些情形下，仅仅习性一项已经足够了；没有动物比小野兔更难以驯服的了，也几乎没有动物比小家兔更驯顺的了。但我很难设想家兔仅仅为了驯服性才被选择下来；所以从极野的到极驯服的性质的遗传变化，必须全部归因于习性和长久持续的严格圈养。

自然的本能在家养状况下可以消失：最显著的例子见于少孵蛋或不喜孵蛋的鸡品种。仅仅由于司空见惯，我们才看不出家养动物的心理曾经有过多么普遍的变化。对于人类的亲爱已经成了狗的本能，这是毋庸置疑的。一切狼、狐、胡狼（jackal）以及猫属的物种即使驯养后，也极渴望攻击鸡、羊和猪；火地和澳洲这些地方的未开化人不养狗，因为曾发现这种倾向在家里养的小狗身上是不能矫正的。另一方面，已经文明化了的狗，甚至在十分幼小的时候，也很少必要去教其不要攻击鸡、羊和猪！无疑会偶尔攻击一下子，于是就要遭一顿打；如果还不能矫正，就会被弄死；那个习性，通过某种程度的选择，也许协同地靠遗传使家狗文明化了。另一方面，小鸡完全出于习性，已经消失了原本无疑惧怕猫狗的本能；而小雉鸡尽管是由母鸡抚养的，却是明显具有这种本能的。倒不是小鸡失去了一切惧怕，而只是失去了对于猫狗的惧怕，因为，母鸡发出报告危险的叫声，小鸡便从母鸡的翼下跑开（小火鸡尤其如此），躲到四周的草丛里或林子里去了。这显然是本能的动作，便于母鸟飞走，就如我们在野生的陆栖鸟类里所看到的那样。但是小鸡还保留着这种本能，在家养状况下已经没有用处，因为母鸡由于不使用的缘故，已经几乎失掉了飞翔能力。

因此，可以断定，动物在家养下可以获得新的本能；而失去自然的本能，这一部分是由于习性，一部分是由于人类在连续世代中选择和累积了特殊的精神习性和精神活动，而它们的最初发生，我们无知地看作是出于偶然的原因。在某些情形下，只是强制的习性一项，已足以产生这种遗传的心理变化；在另外一些情形下，强制的习性就不能发生作用，一切都是有计划选择和无意识选择的结果。但是在大多数情形下，习性和选择大概是双管齐下的。

我们只要考察少数事例，大概就能很好地理解本能在自然状态下如何由于选择作用而改变的。我只选择三个例子，其余的可能要以后著书讨论了——即，杜鹃在别种鸟巢里下蛋的本能，某些蚂蚁蓄奴的本能，以及蜜蜂造蜂房的本能。学者们已经把后两种本能，一般地而且恰当地列为一切已知本能中最奇异的了。

现在已经有共识，杜鹃的这种本能的比较直接的决定性原因，是其并不每日下蛋，而是隔二差三下蛋一次；所以，如果自己筑巢，自己孵蛋，则最先下的蛋便须搁置一些时间后才能得到孵抱，同一个巢里就会有不同龄期的蛋和小鸟了。这样，下蛋和孵蛋的过程就会漫长而不方便，特别是雌鸟在很早就要迁徙，而最初孵化的小鸟势必要由雄鸟单独哺养。但是美洲杜鹃就处于这样的困境；她自己筑巢，而且要在同一时期内产蛋和照顾相继孵化的幼鸟。有人说美洲杜鹃有时也在别种鸟巢里下蛋，但我从权威的布留尔（Brewer）博士那里听到，这不对。不过，我可以举出各种鸟类偶尔在别种鸟巢里下蛋的若干事例。现在假定欧洲杜鹃的古代祖先也有美洲杜鹃的习性，但偶尔也在别种鸟巢里下蛋。如果这种偶尔的习性有利于老鸟，如果小鸟由于利用了其他物种的误养本能，比起母鸟哺养更为强壮——母鸟必须同时照顾不同龄期的蛋和小鸟，不免受到拖累——那么老鸟或寄养的小鸟都会受益。以此类推，我可以相信，这样哺养起来的小鸟大概就会遗传母鸟那种偶然的奇特习性，倾向于把蛋下在别种的鸟巢里，这样就能够成功哺养幼鸟。我相信杜鹃的奇异本能会由这种连续过程而产生出来。补充一句，格雷博士等人说，欧洲杜鹃并未完全失去母爱和对后代的关怀。

鸟类偶尔会把蛋下在同种别种的鸟巢里这种习性，在鸡科里并非不普通，并且可以解释近缘鸵鸟群的奇特本能的来源。至少是美国种的个案，若干母鸵鸟共同先在一个巢里，然后在另一个巢里下一些蛋，由雄鸟去孵。这种本能或可以解释为雌鸟下蛋很多，但如杜鹃一样，隔二差三才下一次。然而美洲鸵鸟的这种本能，还没有达到完善；因为有多得出奇的蛋都散落在地上，我在一天的游猎中，就拾得了不下二十个丢弃的蛋。

许多蜂是寄生的，总是把卵产在别种的蜂巢里，这个个案比杜鹃更令人瞩目；这种蜂随着寄生习性，不但改变了本能，而且改变了构造；它们不具有采集花粉的器具，如果要为幼蜂贮藏食料，这是必不可少的。泥蜂科（Sphecidae；形似胡蜂）的某些物种同样也是寄生的；法布尔最近提出充分的理由认为：一种小唇沙蜂（Tachytes nigra）虽然通常都自己造巢，而且为幼虫储蓄麻痹了的食物，但发现别种泥蜂所造储蓄有食物的巢，便会加以利用，而变成临时的寄生者。这种情形和杜鹃的假设情形是一样的，我觉得如果一种临时的习性对于物种有利，同时被害的蜂类不会因巢和储蓄的食物被无情夺取而遭到灭绝，自然选择就不难把它永久化。




蓄奴的本能。——这种奇妙的本能，是由于贝尔最初在红褐蚁（Formica［Polyerges］rufescens）身上发现的，他是一位比他著名的父亲更为优秀的观察者。这种蚂蚁绝对依赖奴隶而生活；没有奴隶的帮助，这个物种一年之内一定灭绝。雄蚁和能育的雌蚁不从事任何工作，工蚁即不育的雌蚁虽然在捕捉奴隶上极为卖力勇敢，但不做其他任何工作。它们不能营造自己的巢，也不能哺喂自己的幼虫。在老巢已不适用，势必迁徙的时候，是由奴蚁来决定迁徙的事情，并且实际上把主人们衔在颚间搬走。主人们十分的不中用，当于贝尔捉了三十个关起来而没有一个奴蚁时，虽然那里放着它们最喜爱的丰富食物，而且有自己的幼虫和蛹刺激它们工作，它们还是无所事事；它们甚至不会自己吃东西，许多蚂蚁就此饿毙。于贝尔随后放进一个奴蚁——黑蚁（F. fusca），她即刻开始工作，喂哺和拯救那些生存者；并且营造了几间虫房，来照料幼虫，一切都整得井井有条。有什么比这十分肯定的事实更为奇异的呢？如果我们不知道任何其他蓄奴的蚁类，大概就无法想象如此奇异的本能是怎样完善的。

血蚁（Formica sanguinea）同样蓄奴，也是于贝尔最初发现的。这个物种见于英格兰南部，大英博物馆史密斯（F. Smith）先生研究过它的习性。关于这个问题以及其他问题，我深深感激他的帮助。虽然我充分相信于贝尔和史密斯先生的叙述，但仍然以怀疑的心情来处理这个问题，任何人对于蓄奴的这种异常丑恶本能的存在有所怀疑，大概都得谅解。因此，我愿意稍微详细地谈谈我的观察。我曾掘开十四个血蚁巢，都发现了若干奴蚁。奴种的雄蚁和能育的雌蚁，只见于它们自己固有的群中，在血蚁巢中从未看见过。黑色奴蚁，不及红色主人的一半大，外貌上对比强烈。蚁巢被微微扰动时，奴蚁偶尔跑出外边来，像主人一样十分激动，并且保家卫国；当蚁巢被扰动得很厉害，幼虫和蛹暴露出来的时候，奴蚁和主人一齐奋发地把它们运送到安全的地方。因此，奴蚁显然是熟门熟路。在连续三个年头的六月和七月里，我在萨里郡和萨塞克斯郡，曾对几个蚁巢观察了几个小时，从来没有看到一个奴蚁自蚁巢里走出走进。在这些月份里，奴蚁的数目很少，因此我想数目多的时候，行动大概就不同了；但史密斯先生告诉我说，五月、六月以及八月间，在萨里和汉普郡，他在各种不同的时间内注意观察了蚁巢，虽然八月份奴蚁的数目很多，但也不曾看到它们走出走进蚁巢。因此，他认为它们是严格的家奴。而主人却不然，经常看到它们不断地搬运着造巢材料和各种食物。然而今年七月里，我遇见一个奴蚁特别多的蚁群，观察到有少数奴蚁和主人混在一起离巢，沿着同一条路向着约二十五码远的一株高大欧洲赤松前进，它们一齐爬到树上去，大概是为了找寻蚜虫或胭脂虫的。于贝尔有过许多观察的机会，他说，瑞士的奴蚁在造蚁巢的时候常常和主人一起干，而在早晚间则单独看管门户。于贝尔还明确地说，奴蚁的主要职务是搜寻蚜虫。两个国家里的主奴两蚁的普通习性如此不同，大概仅仅由于在瑞士被捕捉的奴蚁数目比英格兰多。

有一天，我有幸看到了血蚁搬巢，于贝尔描述过，主人们谨慎地把奴蚁带在颚间，这真是极有趣的奇观。另一天，大约有二十只蓄奴蚁在同一地点猎取东西，而显然不是找寻食物，这引起了我的注意。它们走近一种奴蚁——独立的黑蚁群，并且遭到猛烈的反击。有时候三个奴蚁揪住蓄奴血蚁的腿不放，蓄奴蚁残忍地弄死了小抵抗者，并且把尸体拖到二十九码远的巢中去当食物，但得不到一个蛹来培养为奴。于是我从另一个巢里掘出一小团黑蚁的蛹，放在邻近战场的一处空地上。于是这班暴君热切地把它们捉住并且拖走，大概以为毕竟是在最后的战役中获胜了。

同时，我在同一场所放下另一物种——黄蚁（F. flava）的一小团蛹，其上还有几只小黄蚁攀附在蚁巢破片上。如史密斯先生所描述的，这个物种有时会沦落为奴，但很少见。这种蚁虽然这么小，但极勇敢，我看到过它们凶猛地攻击别种蚁。有一个事例，我惊奇地看见蓄奴血蚁巢下有一块石头，底下是一个独立的黄蚁群；我偶然地扰动这两个巢，小蚂蚁就以惊人的勇气去攻击它们的大邻居。当时我渴望确定血蚁能否辨别常捉做奴隶的黑蚁的蛹与很少捉拿的小型而凶猛的黄蚁的蛹，明显地它们确能立刻辨别；因为我们看见遇到黑蚁的蛹时，它们即刻热切地去捉，而遇到黄蚁的蛹，甚至遇到其巢的泥土时，便惊慌失措，赶紧跑开；但是，大约经过一刻钟，当这种小黄蚁都爬走之后，它们才鼓起勇气，把蛹搬走。

一天傍晚，我看见另一群血蚁，发现若干这种蚁拖着黑蚁的尸体（可以看出不是迁徙）和无数的蛹回巢。我跟着背着战利品鱼贯而行的蚁追踪前去，大约有四十码之远，到了一处密集的石南科灌木丛（heath），我看到最后一个血蚁出现，拖着一个蛹，但无法在密丛中找到被蹂躏的蚁巢。然而那巢一定就在附近，因为有两三只黑蚁极度张皇地冲出来，有一只嘴里还衔着自己的蛹一动不动地停留在石南的小枝顶上，在破碎的家上方。

这些都是关于蓄奴的奇异本能的事实，无须我来证实。让我们看一看，血蚁的本能习性和欧洲大陆上的红褐蚁的鲜明对照。后一种不会筑巢，不会决定自己的迁徙，不会为自己和幼蚁采集食物，甚至不会自己吃东西：完全依赖无数的奴蚁。血蚁则不然，拥有很少的奴蚁，初夏时奴蚁是极少的。主人决定在何时何地营造新蚁巢，并且迁徙的时候，还衔着奴蚁走。瑞士和英格兰的奴蚁似乎都专门照顾幼蚁，主人单独做捕捉奴蚁的远征。瑞士的奴蚁和主人一齐工作，搬运材料回去造巢；主奴共同地，但主要是奴蚁在照顾它们的蚜虫，并进行所谓的挤乳；这样，主奴都为本群采集食物。在英格兰，通常是主人单独出去搜寻筑巢材料，为它们自己、奴蚁和幼蚁搜寻食物。所以，我国奴蚁为主人所服的劳役，比在瑞士少得多。

血蚁的本能靠什么步骤发生，我不愿妄加臆测。但是，据我所看到的，不蓄奴的蚁如果有其他物种的蛹散落在蚁巢近旁，也要把这些蛹拖进去，所以这些本来贮作食物的蛹可能发育起来；这样无意识地被养育起来的外来蚁将会追随自己的固有本能，做它们所能做的工作。如果它们的存在证明对于捕获它们的物种有用——如果捕捉工蚁比自己生育工蚁对于这个物种更有利——那么，本是采集蚁蛹供食用的这种习性，大概会因自然选择而加强，并且变为永久的，以达到非常不同的蓄奴目的。本能一旦获得，即使它的应用范围远不及英国的血蚁（如我们所看到的，这种蚁在依赖奴蚁的帮助上比瑞士的同一物种为少），我看自然选择也不难增强和改变这种本能——始终假定每一个变异对于物种都有用处——直到形成一种像红褐蚁那样卑鄙地依靠奴隶来生活的蚁类。




蜜蜂营造蜂房的本能。——这个问题不拟详加讨论，而只是把我所得到的结论的纲要说一说。凡是考察过蜂巢的精巧构造的人，看到如此美妙地适应它的目的而不热烈赞赏，必定是愚钝不堪。听到数学家说蜜蜂已实际解决了深奥的问题，把蜂房造成适当的形状，来容纳最大可能容量的蜜，而在建造中则用最小限度的贵重蜡质。有人说，一个熟练的工人，用合适的工具和度量衡，也很难造出正形的蜡质蜂房来，但是一群蜜蜂却能在黑暗的蜂箱内把它造成。随便你说这是什么本能都可以，乍一看似乎是不可思议的，如何能造出所有必要的角和面，甚至如何能觉察出做工正确。但是这难点并不像最初看来那样大；我想可以证明，这一切美妙的工作都是来自几种简单的本能。

我研究这个问题，是受沃特豪斯先生的引导。他阐明，蜂房的形状和邻接蜂房的存在有密切关系；下述观点大概只能看作是他的理论的修正。让我们看看伟大的分级原理，看看自然是否向我们揭示了其工作方法。这个简短系列的一端有大黄蜂，用旧茧来贮蜜，有时候在茧壳上添加蜡质短管，而且同样也会做出分隔的、很不规则的圆形蜡质蜂房。这系列的另一端则有蜜蜂的蜂房，排列为双层：每一个蜂房，众所周知，都是六面柱体，六边的底边倾斜地联合成三个菱形所组成的倒角锥体。菱形都有一定的角度，并且在蜂巢的一面，一个蜂房的角锥形底部的三条边，正好构成了反面的三个连接蜂房的底部。这一系列里，处于极完美的蜜蜂蜂房和简单的大黄蜂蜂房之间的，还有墨西哥蜂（Melipona domestica）的蜂房，于贝尔曾经仔细描述过和绘制过。墨西哥蜂的身体构造介于蜜蜂和大黄蜂之间，但与后者关系比较接近；能营造差不多规则的蜡质蜂巢，圆柱形蜂房，在里面孵化幼蜂，此外还有一些用作贮蜜的大型蜡质蜂房。这些大型的蜂房接近球状，大小差不多相等，并且聚集成不规则的一堆。这里要注意的要点是，蜂房总是营造得彼此很靠近，如果完全成为球状时，蜡壁势必就要交切或串通；但是从来不会如此，因为这种蜂会在有交切倾向的球状蜂房之间把蜡壁造成平面的。因此，每个蜂房都是由外方的球状部分和两三个或更多平面构成的，这要看这个蜂房与两三个或更多的蜂房相连接来决定。一个蜂房连接三个蜂房时，由于球形是差不多大小的，这种情形常常而且必然发生，所以三个平面连合成为一个角锥体；据于贝尔说，这种角锥体明显与蜜蜂蜂房的三边角锥形底部十分相像。这里和蜜蜂蜂房一样，任何蜂房的三个平面必然成为所连接的三个蜂房的构成部分。墨西哥蜂用这种营造方法，显然可以节省蜡；因为连接蜂房之间的平面壁并不是双层的，其厚薄和外面的球状部分相同，然而每一个平面壁却构成了两个蜂房的共同部分。

考虑这个个案时，我觉得如果墨西哥蜂在一定的彼此距离间营造球状蜂房，并且造成一样大小，同时对称排列成双层，那么这构造就会像蜜蜂巢一样完美了。所以我写信给剑桥的米勒（Miller）教授，根据他的复信，我写出了以下的叙述，这位几何学家惠读了，并且告诉我说，这是完全正确的：

设若干同等大小的球，球心在两个平行层上；每一个球的球心与同层中围绕它的六个球的球心相距等于或稍微小于半径×，即半径×1.41421；并且与别一平行层中连接的球的球心相距也如上；于是，如果把这双层每两个球的交接面都画出来，就会形成一个双层六面柱体，其互相衔接的面都是由三个菱形所组成的角锥形底部联结而成的；这个角锥形与六面柱体的边所成的角，与经过精密测量的蜜蜂蜂房的角完全相等。

因此可以稳妥地断定，如果能把墨西哥蜂的并不很奇异的已有本能稍微改变一下，便能造出像蜜蜂那样巧夺天工的蜂房。我们必须假定，墨西哥蜂有能力来营造真正球状的和大小相等的蜂房；鉴于已经能够在一定程度上做到这点，鉴于还有许多昆虫也能够在树木上造成多么完美的圆柱形孔穴，分明是依据一个固定的点旋转而成的，这就没有什么值得奇怪的了。必须假定，墨西哥蜂能把蜂房排列在水平层上，而其圆柱形蜂房就是这样排列的。必须进一步假定，当几只工蜂工友分别营造球状蜂房时，能好歹正确判断彼此应当距离多远，而这是最困难的事；不过，已经能判断距离了，所以总是能使球状蜂房有某种程度的交切；然后把交切点用完全的平面连接起来。必须再进一步假定，六面柱体由同层连接球体的交接面形成之后，可以任意延长六面柱体的长度，使之符合仓储蜂蜜的要求，而这一点不难；就像粗鲁的大黄蜂给旧茧的圆孔增加蜡质圆管一样的。本来并不奇异的本能——不比指导鸟类造巢的本能更奇异，经过这样的变异之后，我相信蜜蜂通过自然选择就获得了难以模仿的营造能力。

这种理论可用试验来证明。照特盖特迈耶（Tegetmeier）先生的榜样，我把两个蜂巢分开，中间放一块长而厚的方形蜡版：蜜蜂随即开始在蜡版上凿掘圆形的小凹穴；向深处凿掘这些小穴时，逐渐使它们拓宽，变成约莫蜂房直径的浅盆形，看起来恰似真正球状或者球的一部分。下面的情形是极有趣的：凡是几只蜂彼此靠近开始凿掘盆形凹穴时，相互之间的距离恰使盆形凹穴得到上述宽度（大约相当于一个普通蜂房的宽度），并且在深度上达到这些盆形凹穴所构成的球体直径的六分之一，这时盆形凹穴的边便交切，或彼此串通。一遇到这种情形，即停止往深处凿掘，并且开始在盆边之间的交切处造起平面的蜡壁，所以，每一个六面柱体并不是像普通蜂房那样，建筑在三边角锥体的直边上面，而是建造在一个平滑盆形的扇形边上面的。

然后我把一块薄而狭的涂有朱红色、其边如刃的蜡片放进蜂箱里去，以代替以前所用的方形厚蜡版。于是蜜蜂即刻一如既往地在蜡片的两面开始凿掘一些彼此接近的盆形小穴。但蜡片太薄，如果盆形小穴的底掘得像上述试验一样深，两面便要彼此串通了。然而蜜蜂并不会让这种情形发生，及时停止了开掘；于是那些盆形小穴，掘得深一点时，便出现了平的底，这等由剩下未被咬去的一小薄片朱红色蜡所形成的平底，根据目测，正好位于蜡片正反面的盆形小穴之间的想象上的交切面处。部分地方只咬去一点点，其他地方则是在对面的盆形小穴之间留下大片菱形板，不是自然状态的东西，所以不能精巧地完成工作。蜂在朱红色蜡片的两面，浑圆地咬去蜡质，并使盆形加深，其工作速度想必是差不多的，这是为了能够成功地在交切面处停止工作，而在盆形小穴之间留下平面。

鉴于薄蜡片十分柔软，我想，蜂在蜡片两面工作时，不难觉察到什么时候咬到适当的薄度，于是停止工作。在普通的蜂巢里，我认为蜂在两面的工作速度，并不永远能实现完全相等；我注意过一个刚开始营造的蜂房底部上半完工的菱形板，其一面稍为凹进，我想象这是这面掘得太快的缘故，另一面则凸出，因为这面工作得慢一些。在一个著名事例里，我把这蜂巢放回蜂箱里去，让蜂继续工作一个短时间，然后再检查蜂房，发现菱形板已经完工，并且已经完全平了：蜡片是极薄的，所以绝对不可能是从凸的一面把蜡咬去，做成上述的样子；我猜测这种情形大概是站在反面的蜂，把可塑而温暖的蜡恰到好处地推压弯曲到中间板处（我试验过，很容易做），这样就找平了。

从朱红蜡片的试验可以看出，若要建造一堵蜡质的薄壁，蜂便彼此站在一定距离，以同等的速度凿掘下去，并且努力做成同等大小的球状空室，但永远不会让空室彼此串通，这样就可造适当形状的蜂房。检查一下正在建造的蜂巢边缘，一眼就可看出首先在蜂巢的周围造一堵粗糙的围墙缘边，然后从两面对咬，加深每一个蜂房时，总是绕圈工作。并不在同一时间内营造任一蜂房三边角锥形的整个底部，而是看情况先搞定位于正在建造的极端边缘的一两块菱形板；并且在没有营造六面壁之前，绝不完成菱形板上部的边。这些叙述有些和大名鼎鼎的老于贝尔所说的有所不同，但我相信是正确的；如果有篇幅，我将阐明这符合我的理论。

于贝尔说，最初的第一个蜂房是从侧面相平行的蜡质小壁凿掘造出来的，就我所看到的，这一叙述并不严格正确。最初着手的经常是一个小蜡兜，但这里我不拟详论。我们知道，在蜂房的构造里，凿掘起着何等重要的作用；但如果设想蜂不能在适当的位置——即沿着两个连接的球形体之间的交切面——营造粗糙的蜡壁，就是极大的错误。我有几件标本明显指出是能够这样做的。甚至在环绕着建造中的蜂巢周围的粗糙边缘即蜡壁上，有时候也可观察到弯曲的情形，所在的位置相当于未来蜂房的菱形底面。但在一切场合中，粗糙的蜡壁是靠大口咬掉两面的蜡而完成的。蜂的这种营造方法是奇妙的；总是把最初的粗糙墙壁，造得比最后要留下的蜂房的极薄的壁厚十倍乃至二十倍。要理解它们的工作方法，可以假定泥水匠首先用水泥堆起一堵宽阔基墙，然后在近地面处的两侧把水泥同等地削去，直到中间部分形成一堵光滑而很薄的墙壁；泥水匠总是把削去的水泥堆在墙壁的顶上，还要加入新水泥。于是，薄壁就这样不断地垒上去，但上面总是有一个厚大的顶盖。一切蜂房，无论刚开始营造还是已经完成的，上面都有这样一个坚固的蜡盖，因此，蜂能够聚集在蜂巢上爬来爬去，而不会把薄六面壁损坏。壁的厚度只有约四百分之一英寸，菱形底片大约比其厚一倍。用上述这样特别的营造方法，可以极端地省蜡，同时还能不断地使蜂巢加固。

大批蜜蜂聚集一起工作，乍看这对于理解蜂房的营造方式会增加困难；一只蜂在一个蜂房工作一个短时间后，便到另一个蜂房，所以，如于贝尔所说的，甚至第一个蜂房开始营造时就有二十只蜂在工作。我用实践的方法阐明了这一事实：用朱红色的极薄熔蜡涂在一个蜂房六面壁的边上，或者涂在一个营造着的蜂巢围墙的极端边缘上，结果必定看到蜂把这颜色极细腻地分布开去——细腻得就像画家布色——有颜色的蜡从涂抹的地方一星一星地取去，放到周围蜂房扩大着的边缘上去。营造的工作在多蜂之间似乎有某种平衡分配，彼此本能地站在同一相对距离上，都试图凿掘相等的球形，然后，建造起或者说留下不咬球形之间的交切面。说起来实在是奇异，有时会遇到困难，例如两个蜂巢成角度相遇时，往往把已成的蜂房彻底拆掉，用不同的方法重造，而有时候再现拆去的形状。

蜂遇到可以各就各位进行工作的一处地方，例如，一块木片上，木片恰好处于向下建造的一个蜂巢的中部之下，那么这蜂巢势必就要营造在木片的一面——在这种情况下，蜂便会筑起新的六面体一堵墙的基础，突出于已经完成的蜂房之外，位置严格规定。只要蜂能彼此站在适当的距离并且与最后完成的蜂房墙壁保持适当的距离，掘造了想象的球形体，就足以在两个邻接的球形体之间造起中间蜡壁来；但据我所看到的，非到那蜂房和邻接的几个蜂房大都造成之后，从不咬去和修光蜂房的角。蜂在一定环境条件下，能在两个刚开始营造的蜂房中间把一堵粗糙的壁建立在适当位置上，这种能力是重要的；因为这与一项事实有关，最初看来它似乎可以推翻上述理论；这事实就是，黄蜂最外边缘上的一些蜂房也常常是严格的六边形；但这里没有篇幅讨论这一问题。我并不觉得单独一个昆虫（例如黄蜂蜂后）营造六边形的蜂房会有什么大困难，只要能在同时开始的两三个巢房的内侧和外侧交互地工作，始终与刚开工的蜂房部件保持适当的距离，掘造球形或圆筒形，并且建造起中间的平壁。甚至可以想象，一个昆虫固定于一点开始构筑蜂房，然后移动出去，先到一点，然后到另外五个点，到中心点的相对距离和点之间的距离恰到好处，可以打造诸交切面，构筑孤立的六边形。但我不知道这种个案有没有观察到过，而且构筑单个六边形也没有什么好处，因为这就比构筑圆柱体需要更多的建筑材料。

自然选择仅仅靠构造或本能的微小变异的积累才发挥作用，而各个变异都对个体在其生活条件下是有利的。所以可以合理地发问：变异了的建筑本能所经历的漫长而级进的连续阶段，都趋向现今那样完善的建筑规划，对于蜜蜂祖先，曾起过怎样有利的作用呢？我想，解答这个问题并不困难：我们知道，蜂为了采足花蜜，常常受到很大压力。特盖特迈耶先生告诉我说，实验已经证明，蜜蜂分泌一磅蜡须消耗十二到十五磅干糖；所以一个蜂箱里的蜜蜂为了分泌营造蜂巢所必需的蜡，必须采集并消耗大量的液状花蜜。还有，许多蜂在分泌的过程中，势必有许多天不能工作。大量蜂蜜的贮藏，对于维持大群蜂的冬季生活是必不可缺少的；并且我们知道，蜂群的安全主要决定于大量的蜂得以维持。因此，大大节省蜂蜜，从而省蜡，必定是任何蜂族成功的重要因素。当然，其成功还可能决定于寄生物等敌害的数量，决定于截然不同的原因，所以根本不取决于蜜蜂所能采集的蜜量。但是，让我们假定采集蜜量的能力决定了任何一处地方大黄蜂的数量，这倒是常常发生；让我们进一步假定，那蜂群度过了冬季，结果就需要贮藏蜂蜜：在这种情形下，如果其本能有微小的变异，使得蜡房造得靠近些，略略彼此相切，无疑会有利于这批土蜂；一堵公共的壁即使仅连接两个蜂房，也会节省少许蜡。因此，如果蜂房造得日益整齐，相互日益靠近，并且像墨西哥蜂的蜂房那样聚集在一起，就会不断地日益有利于这种大黄蜂；因为这样各蜂房的大部分界壁将会用作邻接蜂房的界壁，就可以大大省蜡。还有，由于同样的原因，如果墨西哥蜂能把蜂房造得比现在接近些，并且在各方面都更规则些，这于己有利；因为，如我们所看到的，蜂房的球形面会完全消失，代以平面；而墨西哥蜂所造的蜂巢就会达到蜜蜂巢那样完善的地步。在建造上超越这种完善的阶段，自然选择便不能再起作用；因为据我们所知，蜜蜂巢在节蜡方面绝对是完美的。

因此，我认为，一切既知本能中最奇异的本能——蜜蜂的本能，可以根据自然选择利用了简单本能之无数的、连续发生的微小变异来解释；自然选择曾经缓慢、逐步完善地使得蜂在双层上掘造彼此保持一定距离的、同等大小的球形体，并且沿着交切面筑起和凿掘蜡壁。当然，蜂不会知道自己在彼此保持一定距离掘造球形体，正如它们不会知道六面柱体与底部的菱形板是什么角度。自然选择过程的动力在于节蜡；各蜂群在蜡的分泌上消耗最少的蜜，得到了最大的成功，并且把新获得的节约本能遗传给了新蜂群，以便在生存斗争中获得成功的最大机会。

无疑还可用许多极难解释的本能来反对自然选择学说——例如有些本能，我们不知道是怎样起源的；有些本能，我们不知道有中间级进存在；有些本能看上去很不重要，自然选择不大会发生作用；有些本能在自然系统相距甚远的动物里竟几乎相同，所以不能用共同祖先的遗传来说明其相似性，结果只好相信这些本能是通过自然选择而独立获得的。我不预备在这里讨论这些个例子，而仅仅讨论一个特别的难点，起初我认为这个难点是难以克服的，并且实际上对于我的整个理论是致命的。我所指的就是昆虫社会里的中性即不育的雌虫；这些中性虫在本能和构造上常与雄虫以及能育的雌虫有很大的差异，可是由于不育，却不能繁殖同类。

这个问题很值得详细讨论，但这里只举一个个案，即不育的工蚁。工蚁怎么会变为不育的个体是个难点，但不比构造上任何显著变异更难于解释；可以证明，自然状态下某些昆虫以及别种节足动物偶尔也会变为不育；如果这种昆虫是社会性的，而且每年生下若干能工作但不能生殖的个体对于群体有利的话，那我认为不难理解这是由于自然选择的作用。但必须跳过这种初步的难点不谈。最大的难点在于工蚁与雄蚁和能育的雌蚁在构造上有巨大的差异，如工蚁具有不同形状的胸部，缺翅膀，有时没有眼睛，并且具有不同的本能。单以本能而论，蜜蜂可以极好地证明工蜂与完全的雌蜂之间有惊人的差异。如果工蚁或别种中性虫原是正常的动物，那我就会毫不迟疑地假定，一切性状都是通过自然选择慢慢获得的；这就是说，由于生下的个体构造上都具有微小的有利变异，又都遗传给了后代；而且后代又发生变异，又被选择，如此等等，不一而足。但是工蚁和双亲之间的差异很大，又是绝对不育的，所以绝不可能把历代获得的构造上或本能上的变异遗传给后代。于是可以设问：这怎么能符合自然选择的学说呢？

首先，请记住，家养生物和自然状态下的生物里，构造的各种各样差异是与一定年龄或性别相关的，这方面有无数的案例。差异不但与性别相关，而且与生殖系统活跃的那一短暂时期相关，例如，许多鸟类的求婚羽，雄三文鱼钩曲的颚，都是这种情形。公牛经人工去势后，不同品种的角甚至相关地表现了微小的差异；某些品种的去势公牛，与同品种的公牝双方比较，犄角比其他品种更长。因此，我认为任何性状变得与昆虫社会里某些成员的不育状态相关，并不存在多大难点；难点在于理解这种构造上的相关变异如何因自然选择作用而慢慢累积起来。

这个难点表面上看来是难以克服的，可是只要记住选择作用可以应用于个体也可以应用于全族，而且可以由此如愿以偿，那么难点便会缩小，或者如我所相信的，便会消除。比如，一棵味道好的蔬菜煮熟吃了，该个体就消灭了。可是园艺家播下同种蔬菜的种子，信心十足地期望收获差不多的变种。养牛者喜欢肉和脂肪交织成大理石纹的样子，牲口已经屠杀了，但是养牛者有信心继续找到同样的牛。我对于选择的力量也是信心十足，并不怀疑总是产生异常长角的去势公牛的品种，可以慢慢培养，只要仔细观察什么样的公牛和牝牛个体交配才能产生最长角的去势公牛；虽然没有一只去势的牛曾经繁殖过同类。我想社会性的昆虫也是如此：与同群某些成员的不育状态相关的构造、本能上的轻微变异，对于群体有利，结果能育的雄体和雌体得到了繁生，并把这种产生具有同样变异的不育成员的倾向，传递给了能育的后代。我认为，这一过程重复过了许多次，直到同一物种的能育雌体和不育雌体之间产生了巨大的差异量，就像我们在许多种社会性昆虫里所见到的那样。

但我们还没有谈及登峰造极的难点：有几种蚁的中性虫不但与能育的雌虫和雄虫有所差异，而且彼此之间也有差异，有时差异甚至到了让人几乎难以置信的程度，并且因此被分成两个级（castes），甚至三个级。还有，这些级一般并不彼此逐渐重叠，而是区别得十分清楚，有如同属的两个物种，同科的两个属。例如，埃西顿（Eciton）行军蚁的中性工蚁和兵蚁具有大相径庭的颚和本能：隐角蚁（Cryptocerus）只有一个级的工蚁，头上生有一种奇异的盾，用途不清楚；墨西哥的蜜蚁（Myrmecocystus）有一个级的工蚁从不离巢，由另一个级的工蚁喂食，腹部发育得很大，能分泌出一种蜜汁，以代替蚜虫所排泄的东西；蚜虫或者可以被称为蚁乳牛，欧洲的蚁常把它们守卫圈禁起来。

如果不承认这种奇异而十分确实的事实可以瞬间颠覆我的理论，人们必然会想，我对自然选择的原理过于信心饱满了。如果中性虫只有一个级，我相信它与能育的雄虫和雌虫之间的差异是通过自然选择得到的，在这种比较简单的情形里，根据普通变异类推，我们可以断言，各种连续的、微小的、有利的变异，最初并非发生于同一窝中的所有中性虫，而只发生于少数的中性虫；经过长期持续选择能够产生极多的具有有利变异的中性虫的能育亲种，一切中性虫最终就都会具有所需的性状。按照这种观点，我们应该在同一巢中偶尔发现那些表现有构造分级的同种中性虫；实际我们是发现了，鉴于欧洲以外的中性昆虫很少仔细检查过，甚至可以说并不稀罕。史密斯先生曾阐明，有几种英国蚁的中性虫彼此在大小方面，有时在颜色方面，表现了惊人的差异；并且在两极端的类型之间，有时可由同巢中的一些个体连接起来：笔者就比较过这种完美的级进情形。有时可以看到，大形或者小形的工蚁数目最多；或者大形和小形两种都多，而中间形的数目却稀少。黄蚁有大工蚁和小工蚁，中间形的工蚁有一些；如史密斯先生所观察的，在这个物种里，大工蚁有单眼（ocelli），虽小但能够清楚辨认；而小工蚁的单眼则是残迹。仔细解剖了几只工蚁标本之后，我能确定小工蚁的眼睛根本不发育，远非单单用其小比例所能解释；并且我充分相信，虽然我不敢很肯定地断言，中间形工蚁的单眼正好处在中间状态。所以，一个巢内有两群不育工蚁，不但在大小上，并且在视觉器官上，都表现了差异，然而有少数中间状态的成员连接起来。我再补充几句题外的话，如果小工蚁对于蚁群最有利，产生越来越多小工蚁的雄蚁和雌蚁不断被选择，最后所有的工蚁都具有那种形态了。于是就形成了一个蚁种，其中性虫差不多就像褐蚁属（Myrmica）工蚁那样。褐蚁属的工蚁甚至连残迹的单眼都没有，尽管这个属的雄蚁和雌蚁都生有很发达的单眼。

我再举一例：同一物种的不同级的中性虫之间，我满有信心地期望可以找到重要构造的中间分级，欣然利用史密斯先生所提供的取自西非驱逐蚁（Anomma）同巢中的许多标本。我不举实际的测量数字，只做一个严格精确的说明，读者大概就能最好地了解这工蚁之间的差异量；差异就好比看到一群建筑工人，其中有许多是五英尺四英寸高，还有许多是十六英尺高；但我们必须再假定那大个儿工人的头比小个儿工人不止大三倍，却要大四倍，而颚则要大近五倍。再者，大小不同的工蚁的颚不仅在形状上大有差异，而且牙齿的形状和数目也相差悬殊。但重要的事实却是，虽然工蚁可以依大小分为不同的等级，却不知不觉地彼此级进重叠，其构造大不相同的颚也是这样。关于后面一点我有把握，卢伯克先生曾用描图器把我所解剖的几种大小不同的工蚁的颚逐一作图。

根据摆在我面前的这些事实，我相信自然选择由于作用于能育的蚁双亲，便可以形成一个物种，专门产生体形大而具有某一形状的颚的中性虫，或者专门产生体形小而构造大不相同的颚的中性虫；最后，这是登峰造极的难点，一群工蚁具有一种大小和构造，另一群工蚁具有不同大小和构造，同时存在——最先形成的是一个级进的系列，就像驱逐蚁的情形那样，然后，由于自然选择支持生育它们的双亲，就产生了越来越多最有利于蚁群的两极端类型，最后具有中间构造的个体不再产生。

我认为，奇异事实就是这样发生的，同一巢里生存的、区别分明的不育工蚁两级，不但彼此之间大不相同，并且和双亲之间也大不相同。我们可以看出工蚁的生成对于蚁社会有多大的用处，与社会分工对于文明人的用处同理。由于蚁是用遗传的本能和遗传的工具或武器来工作的，而不用学得的知识和制造的器具，所以完美分工只能通过工蚁不育来实施。如果它们能育，就会杂交，其本能和构造就会混杂。我认为，大自然通过自然选择在蚁群中实施了这一令人惊叹的分工。但是必须坦白承认，我虽然完全相信自然选择，若不是有这等中性虫个案让我心悦诚服，决不会料到这一原理是如此高度有效。所以，为了阐明自然选择的力量，并且因为这是我的理论所遭到的特别严重的难点，我对于这个个案做了稍多的但挂一漏万的讨论。而且这个个案也很有趣，证明了动物同植物一样，把无数的微小的必须称为偶发的构造变异，只要是稍微有利的就累积下来，没有锻炼或习性参加作用，任何量的变异都能实现。蚁群的不育成员的锻炼，或者习性，或者意愿，丝毫也不可能影响专事遗留后代的能育成员的构造或者本能。我觉得奇怪的是，至今没有人提出用这种中性虫的演示个案去反对众所熟知的拉马克（Lamarck）的学说。




提要。——本章勉力简要地指出了家养动物的精神品质要变异，且这种变异是遗传的。我又更简要地阐明本能在自然状态下也是轻微变异的。没有人会争辩本能对于各种动物有极端的重要性。所以我认为，在多变的生活条件下，自然选择不难把任何稍微有用的本能上的微小变异累积到任何程度。在许多情况下，习性或者用废大概也参加作用。我不敢说本章所举事实能在很大程度上巩固我的理论；但是根据我所能判断的，没有难解的个案可加以颠覆。另外，本能不总是绝对完善，而是易犯错误；没有一种本能可说是为了其他动物的独享利益而产生的，但各种动物都利用其他动物的本能；博物史上的格言“自然界里没有飞跃”，适用于身体构造也适用于本能，并且可用上述观点来清楚解释，别无他解——所有这些事实都确证了自然选择的学说。

这个理论也得到其他几种关于本能的事实的加强；常见的个案如，密切近似的但不相同的物种，当天各一方并且生活在相当不同的生活条件下时，常常保持了几乎同样的本能。例如，根据遗传原理，我们能够理解，为什么南美鸫跟英国鸫的特别造巢方法一样，用泥来涂抹它们的巢；为什么北美洲的雄性鹪鹩（Troglodytes）像英国的雄性猫形鹪鹩（Kitty-wrens）那样地营造“雄鸟之巢”栖居——这种习性完全不像任何其他已知鸟类。最后，这可能是不合逻辑的演绎，但据我想象，这样说法最能令人满意，如小杜鹃把义兄弟逐出巢外，蓄奴蚁，姬蜂科（ichneumonidae）幼虫寄生在活的毛毛虫体内，不把这种本能看作是特别赋予或特别创造的，而看作是引导一切生物进化——即繁殖，变异，让最强者生存、最弱者死亡——的一般法则的小小结果。





第八章　杂种性质


第一次杂交不育性和杂种不育性的区别——不同程度的不育性，不是普遍的，受近亲交配的影响，因家养而消除——支配杂种不育性的法则——不育性不是特别的禀赋，而是伴随其他差异而起——第一次杂交不育性和杂种不育性的原因——变化了的生活条件的效果和杂交的效果之间的平行现象——变种杂交的能育性及混种后代的能育性不是普遍的——不考虑能育性，杂种和混种的比较——提要

博物学者们一般抱有一种观点，认为一些物种互相杂交，被特别地赋予了不育性，借以阻止生物的混杂。这一观点乍看对，因为物种生活在同区域，如果可以自由杂交，很少能够保持不混杂的。杂种普遍都不育，我看这一点的重要性被最近一些作者低估了。根据自然选择理论，这个个案尤其重要，因为杂种的不育性不可能对它们有利，从而并不能由各种不同程度的、连续的、有利的不育性的持续保存而获得。不过，我希望能够阐明，不育性并不是特别获得或者禀赋的品质，而是伴随其他获得差异而产生的。

讨论这一主题时，有两类截然不同的事实，一般却被混淆在一起；即：两个物种在第一次杂交时的不育性，以及由它们产生出来的杂种的不育性。

纯粹的物种当然具有完善的生殖器官，然而互相杂交时，则很少产生后代，或者不产生后代。另一方面，从动植物的雄性生殖质都可以明显看出，杂种的生殖器官在性机能上无能，虽然生殖器官本身的构造在显微镜下看来还是完善的。在上述第一种情形里，形成胚体的雌雄性生殖质是完善的，在第二种情形里，雌雄性生殖质要么完全不发育，要么发育不完全。必须考虑两种情形所共有的不育性的原因时，这种区别是重要的。由于把两种情形下的不育性都看作是并非我们理解能力所能掌握的一种特别禀赋，这种区别大概模糊了。

变种——即知道或认为是从共同祖先传下来的类型——杂交时的能育性，以及它们的杂种后代的能育性，对于我的理论，与物种杂交时的不育性有同等的重要性；因为这似乎在物种和变种之间划出了明确而清楚的区别。

首先，是关于物种杂交时的不育性及其杂种后代的不育性。科尔路特和盖特纳两位认真可敬的观察者几乎毕生研究这个问题，凡是读过他们若干研究报告和著作的，不可能不深深感到某种程度的不育性是非常普遍的。科尔路特把这个规律普遍化了。可是十个例子中，他发现有两个类型，虽被大多数作者看作是不同物种，在杂交时却是十分能育的，于是他快刀斩乱麻，毫不犹豫地将其列为变种。盖特纳也把这个规律同样普遍化了，而对科尔路特所举十例的完全能育性提出质疑。但是在这些和许多其他个案里，盖特纳不得不细数产籽数，以指出其中有任何程度的不育性。他总是把两物种杂交时、杂种后代所产种子的最高数目，与双方纯亲种在自然状态下种子的平均数相比。但是我看由此引入了严重的出错原因：进行杂交的植物必须去势，更必须隔离，以防止昆虫带来其他植物的花粉。盖特纳所试验的植物几乎全都是盆栽的，看样子放在他家一间屋子里。这些做法无疑常常会损害植物的能育性；他在列表中所举植物有二十个个案，都去势了，并且以自花进行人工授粉（一切豆科植物除外，公认难操纵），这二十种植物的一半，能育性受到了某种程度的损害。还有，盖特纳几年里反复杂交樱草和黄花九轮草，我们有充足理由将其当变种，所以他收获能育种子的只有一两次。他使普通的红花海绿（Anagallis arvensis）和蓝花海绿（Anagallis coerulea）进行杂交，发现是绝对不育的，而这些类型曾被最优秀的植物学家们列为变种。他在许多同类个案中都得出了同样结论。依我看，我们满可以怀疑许多物种互相杂交时是否的确这样不育，这是他所认为的。

可以肯定，一方面，各个物种杂交时的不育性程度大不相同，并且不易觉察地分级消失；另一方面，纯粹物种的能育性易受各种环境条件的影响，所以从一切实用的目的看，极难说出完全的能育性在何处终，而不育性又何处始。关于这一点，我想没有比史上最有经验的观察者科尔路特和盖特纳所提出的证据更为可靠的了，他们对于一模一样的物种曾得出决然相反的结论。关于某些可疑类型究应列为物种还是变种的问题，试把最优秀的植物学家们提出的证据，与不同的杂交工作者从能育性推论出来的证据或同一作者从不同年代的试验中推论出来的证据加以比较，也是最有意义的，但是这里没有篇幅来详论。由此可见，无论不育性或能育性都不能在物种和变种之间划确定的界限。从这一来源得出的证据逐渐减弱，其可疑的程度不亚于从其他体质和构造上的差异所得出的证据。

关于杂种在连续世代中的不育性，虽然盖特纳谨慎地防止了一些杂种和纯种的父母本相杂交，能够把它们培育到六七代，一个个案甚至到了十代，但是他肯定地说，它们的能育性从不增高，反而普遍地大幅度降低了。我不怀疑这是常见的情况，能育性往往在开始几代里突然下降。我认为所有这些实验里，能育性的减低都是由于一个独立的原因，即过于接近的近亲交配。我曾搜集到多如牛毛的事实，表明很接近的近亲交配减低能育性，另一方面，与不同的个体或变种进行偶然的杂交可增高能育性，所以这个育种者几乎普遍相信的观点的正确性，我是无可置疑的。试验者们很少种植大量的杂种；并且因为亲种，或其他近缘杂种一般都养在同一园圃内，所以在开花季节必须谨慎防止昆虫进入；所以，杂种在每一世代中一般便会由自花的花粉而受精；我确信这样会损害本已由于杂种根源而降低的能育性。盖特纳反复说过的一句重要陈述，使我的这一信念加强了，他说，哪怕能育性较低的杂种，如果用同类杂种的花粉进行人工授精，不管由操纵所常常带来的不良影响，能育性往往还是决定性增高的，而且会继续不断增高。在人工授粉的过程中，偶然从另一朵花的花药上采取花粉，犹如常常从准备受精的花本身的花药上采取花粉一样是常见的事（从我的经验知道）；所以，两朵花的杂交，就这样实现了，即使大概是同一植株的两朵花。还有，凡是进行复杂的试验，像盖特纳如此谨慎的观察者也要把杂种的雄蕊去掉，这就可以在每一世代中保证用异花花粉进行杂交，这异花要么来自同一植株，要么来自同一杂种性质的另一植株。因此，我相信，与自发的自花受精正相反，人工授精的杂种在连续世代中可以增高能育性这一奇异的事实，是可以依据避免过于接近的近亲交配来解释的。

现在让我们谈一谈第三位极有经验的杂交工作者赫伯特牧师所得到的结果。他的结论中强调某些杂种是完全能育的，与纯亲种一样能育，就像科尔路特和盖特纳强调不同物种之间存在着某种程度的不育性是普遍的自然法则一样。他对于盖特纳试验过的完全同样的一些物种进行了试验。结果之所以不同，我想一方面是由于赫伯特的园艺绝技，一方面是有温室可供使用。在他的许多重要陈述中，我只举出一项作为例子，即：“在长叶文殊兰（Crinum capense）蒴中的各个胚珠上授以卷叶文殊兰（C. revolutum）的花粉，就会产生自然受精情形下（他说）我从未看见过的植株。”所以这里我们看到，两个不同物种的第一次杂交，就会得到完全的甚至超完全的能育性。

文殊兰属这个例子使我想起一个奇妙的事实，有个体植物，如半边莲属（Lobelia）部分物种，朱顶红属（Hippeastrum）全部物种，容易用不同物种的花粉，但不易用同种花粉来受精。已经发现这些植株对不同物种的花粉结籽，虽然对于自花花粉不育，但发现其花粉使其他物种的受精，是完全正常的。所以，对于一些个体以及某些物种的一切个体，比用自花受精，实际上更容易产生杂种！例如，朱顶红（Hippeastrum aulicum）的一个鳞茎开了四朵花，赫伯特在其中的三朵花上授以自花受精，然后在第四朵花上授以从三个不同物种传下来的复杂种（compound hybrid）的花粉受精，其结果是：“前三朵花的子房很快就停止生长，几天后完全枯萎，至于由杂种花粉受精的蒴则生长旺盛，迅速达到成熟，并且结下能够自由生长的优良种子。”赫伯特先生1839年写信给我说，他已经实验五年了，其后多年继续同一试验，结果始终如一。这还被其他观察者证实，个案有朱顶红及其亚属，还有其他属，如半边莲属、西番莲属（Passiflora）、毛蕊花属（Verbascum）。尽管实验植株看上去完全健康，尽管同一种花胚珠花粉对于其他物种完全正常，可是在相互自花授粉时却机能不全，必须推论，植株处于非自然状态之中。然而，这些事例可以证明，与自花授粉的同物种相比，决定一个物种杂交能育性的高低，其原因常常是何等的微细而不可思议。

园艺家的实际试验虽然缺少科学精密性，却值得留意。众所周知，天竺葵属、倒挂金钟属（Fuchsia）、蒲包花属（Calceolaria）、矮牵牛属（Petunia）、杜鹃花属等等物种之间，进行过何等复杂方式的杂交，然而许多这些杂种都能自由结籽。例如，赫伯特断言，从绉叶蒲包花（Calceolaria integrifolia）和车前叶蒲包花（Calceolaria integrifolia plantaginea）这两个习性上颇不相同的物种得到一个杂种，“自己完全能够繁殖，就像来自智利山区的自然物种”。我煞费苦心地探究过杜鹃花属复杂杂交的能育性程度，可以确定多数是完全能育的。诺布尔（C. Noble）先生告诉我，他把小亚细亚杜鹃（Rhod. ponticum）和北美山杜鹃（Rhod. catawbiense）之间的杂种嫁接在某些砧木上，这个杂种“有我们所能想象的自由结籽能力”。杂种在正当的处理下，如果能育性在每一连续世代中经常不断地减低，如盖特纳所相信的那样，那这事早已被艺园者盯上了。园艺家把同一杂种培育在广大园地上，只有这样才是正当处理，因为昆虫的媒介作用，若干个体可以彼此自由杂交，阻止了接近的近亲交配的有害影响。只要检查一下杜鹃花属杂种不育种的花，任何人都易相信昆虫媒介作用的效力，它们不产生花粉，柱头上却可见来自异花的大量花粉。

对动物进行的仔细试验，远比植物为少。如果我们的分类系统是可靠的，这就是说，如果动物各属彼此间的区别程度不亚于植物，就可以推论，系统上区别较大的动物，比植物易于杂交；但是我想，杂种本身则更加不育了。我怀疑任何完全能育的杂种动物个案是否可以看作彻底鉴定下来了。然而，应当记住，由于很少有动物能够在圈养中自由生育，正规的实验做得不多。例如，金丝雀曾和九种其他雀科鸣禽杂交，由于九种鸟都不能在圈养中自由生育，我们就无权指望它们与金丝雀的第一次杂交品种或者其杂种是完全能育的。至于能育的动物杂种在连续世代中的能育性，我几乎不知道任何事例，从不同父母同时培育出同一杂种的两个家族，可以避免接近的近亲交配的恶劣影响。相反，动物的兄弟姊妹通常却在每一连续世代中进行杂交，违背了每一个饲养者反复提出的告诫。在这种情形下，杂种固有的不育性继续增高，完全不足为奇。如果我们这样做，就像纯种动物的兄弟姐妹交配那样，因为它们不论什么原因都极少有不育倾向，该品种肯定会在几代之内消失。

虽然我不能举出彻底可靠的例子，说明动物的杂种是完全能育的，但有理由相信凡季那利斯羌鹿（Cervulus vaginalis）和列外西羌鹿（Reevesii）间的杂种以及东亚雉（Phasianus colchicus）和环雉（P. torquatus）间的杂种是完全能育的。欧洲的普通鹅和中国鹅（A. cygnoides）是截然不同的物种，一般都列为不同的属，但它们的杂种在我国与任一纯粹亲种杂交，常常是能育的，并且在一个仅有的例子里，杂种互相交配，也是能育的。这是艾顿先生的成就，他从同一对父母培育出两只杂种鹅，但不是同时孵抱的；从这两只杂种鹅又育成一窝八个杂种（是当初两只纯种鹅的孙代）。然而，在印度这些杂种鹅一定更是能育的；因为两位异常能干的法官布莱斯先生和赫顿大尉告诉我，印度到处饲育着大群这样的杂种鹅群；因为在纯粹的亲种已不存在的地方，饲养是为了养家糊口，所以它们必定是高度能育的。

由帕拉斯最初提出的学说，基本上被现代博物学接受了，那就是，大部分家养动物是从两个以上的野生物种传下来的，后来杂交混合。根据这一观点，原始的亲种要么一开头就产生了完全能育的杂种，要么就是杂种在此后的家养状况下变为能育的。后一种情形我看可能性似乎最大，我愿意相信它，尽管没有直接证据。例如，我相信家狗是从几种野生祖先传下来的，大概除了南美洲某些原产家狗，所有的家狗互相杂交，都是十分能育的；但类推起来使我大大怀疑，这几个原始物种是否在最初曾经互相杂交，而且产生了能育的杂种。因此有理由相信，普通欧洲牛与印度瘤牛互相交配是能育的；而根据布莱斯先生给我的材料，我想它们必须认作不同的物种。根据关于许多家畜起源的这个观点，我们必须要么放弃不同物种杂交时普遍不育性的信念，要么承认动物的不育性不是恒久的性状，可以在家养状况下消除。

最后，根据动植物互相杂交的一切确定事实，可以得出结论，第一次杂交及其杂种具有某种程度的不育性，乃是极其一般的结果；但根据我们目前的知识而言，却不能认为这是绝对普遍的。




支配第一次杂交不育性和杂种不育性的法则。——关于支配第一次杂交和杂种不育性的情况与法则，现在要讨论得详细一些。主要目的在于看一看，这些法则是否表示物种被专门赋予了这种不育的性质，以阻止它们的杂交混合，一片混乱。下面的法则和结论主要是从盖特纳令人称赞的植物杂交工作中得出来的。我曾煞费苦心地确定这些法则在动物方面究竟能应用到什么程度，鉴于我们关于杂种动物的知识极其贫乏，我惊奇地发现这些同样的法则如此普遍地适用于动植物界。

前面已经指出，第一次杂交能育性和杂种能育性程度，是从零能育逐渐级进到完全能育。令人惊奇的是，这种级进可由很多奇妙的方式表现出来，但这里只能提出事实的最简略概要。如果把某一科植物的花粉放在另一科植物的柱头上，其所能产生的影响并不比无机的灰尘大。从这种绝对零能育起，把不同物种的花粉放在同属某物种的柱头上，可以产生数量不同的种子，而形成一个完全系列的级进，直到几乎完全能育，甚至十分完全能育；我们知道，在某些异常情形下，甚至有过度的能育性，超过用自己花粉的能育性。杂种也是如此，有些杂种，甚至用纯粹亲种的花粉受精，也从来没有产生过、大概永远也不会产生出一粒能育的种子；但在某些这等例子里，可以看出能育性的最初痕迹，即以纯粹亲种的花粉受精，可以致使杂种的花比不如此受粉的花凋谢较早；而花的早谢为初期受精的一种征兆，是众所熟知的。从这种极度的不育性起，我们有自交能育的杂种，可以产生越来越多的种子，直到具有完全的能育性为止。

从很难杂交的和杂交后很少产生后代的两个物种产生出来的杂种，一般是很不育的；但是第一次杂交的困难和这样产生出来的杂种的不育性——这两类事实常被混淆在一起——之间并不严格平行。在许多情形里，两个纯粹物种异常易于杂交，并产生无数的杂种后代，然而这些杂种是显著不育的。另一方面，有一些物种很少能够杂交或者极难杂交，但是终于产生出来的杂种却很能育。甚至在同一个属的范围内，例如在石竹属（Dianthus）里，也有这两种相反的情形存在。

第一次杂交的能育性和杂种的能育性比起纯粹物种的能育性，更易受不良条件的影响。不过，能育程度也内在地易于变异，因为同样的两个物种在同样环境条件下进行杂交，能育程度并不永远一样，而是部分地决定于碰巧选作试验之用的个体的体质。杂种也是如此，因为在同一个蒴里的种子培育出来的并处于同样条件下的若干个体，其能育程度常有很大差异。

分类系统上的亲缘关系（systematic affinity）这一术语，是指物种之间在构造体质上的相似性而言，特别是生理重要性很大、亲缘物种之间差别很小的部分的构造。物种第一次杂交的能育性以及由此产生的杂种的能育性，主要是受分类系统的亲缘关系所支配的。被分类学家列为不同科的物种之间从没产生过杂种；而密切近似的物种一般容易杂交，这就阐明了这一点。但是分类系统上的亲缘关系和杂交难易之间的对应并不严格。无数的例子证明，极其密切近似的物种并不能杂交，或者极难杂交；另一方面，很不同的物种却极其容易杂交。同一个科里也许有一个属，如石竹属有许多物种极易杂交；而另一个属，如麦瓶草属（Silene），却功败垂成，极其接近的物种不能产生一个杂种。哪怕同一个属的范围内也同样会千差万别。例如，烟草属（Nicotiana）的许多物种几乎比任何其他属的物种更容易杂交，但是盖特纳发现并非特别不同的一个物种——智利尖叶烟草（N. acuminata）曾和不下八个烟草属的其他物种进行过杂交，它顽固地不能受精，也不能使其他物种受精。如此等等不一而足。

没有人能够指出，就可辨识的性状而言，究竟是什么种类或什么数量的差异足以阻止两个物种杂交。可以证明，习性和一般外形极其明显不同的，而且花的每一部分，甚至花粉、果实，以及子叶有着极显著差异的植物也能杂交。一年生植物和多年生植物，落叶树和常绿树，生长在不同地点且适应极其不同气候的植物，也常常容易杂交。

所谓两个物种的互交（reciprocal cross），是指这样的个案：例如，先以母驴和公马杂交，然后再以母马和公驴杂交；如此，这两个物种就是互交了。在互交的难易上，常大相径庭。这种个案极重要，证明了任何两个物种的杂交能力，常和分类亲缘关系完全无关，和两者的整个体制上任何可辨别的差异无关。另一方面，它们清楚地表明，杂交能力与我们无法识别的体质差别相关，且仅限于生殖系统。科尔路特很早以前就观察到相同的两个物种之间互交结果的这种差别。兹举一例，紫茉莉（Mirabilis jalapa）容易由长筒紫茉莉（M. longiflora）的花粉来受精，且其杂种是充分能育的；但是科尔路特曾经试图以紫茉莉的花粉使长筒紫茉莉受精，接连八年试验二百多次，完全失败。还可以举若干同样显著的例子。特莱（Thuret）在某些海藻即墨角藻属（Fuci）里观察到同样的事实。另外盖特纳发现，互交难易度的小幅度差别是极普通的。他甚至在许多植物学家仅仅列为变种的亲缘接近的类型，如一年生紫罗兰（Matthiola annua）和无毛紫罗兰（Matthiola glabra）之间，观察到了这种情形。还有一个值得注意的事实，即互交产生的杂种，当然是完全相同的两个物种混合而来，不过一个物种先用作父本然后用作母本，一般在能育性上却略有不同，有时还表现了高度的差异。

还可举出盖特纳若干其他的奇妙规律：例如，某些物种特别能和其他物种杂交；同属的其他物种特别能使其杂种后代类似自己；但是这两种能力不一定相辅相成。有一些杂种，不像通常那样具有双亲之间的中间性状，却总是与某一方密切相似；这等杂种虽然外观很像纯粹亲种的一方，但都是极端不育的，极少例外。还有，通常具有双亲间中间构造的杂种里，有时会出现例外异常的个体，与纯粹亲种的一方密切相似；这些杂种几乎总是极端不育，哪怕同一个蒴里的种子培育出来的其他杂种相当能育。这些事实表明，杂种的能育性根本不取决于外观上与一纯粹亲种相似。

从支配第一次杂交和杂种能育性的上述若干规律，可见必须看作是真正不同物种的类型杂交时，其能育性是从零能育逐渐到完全能育，某些条件下甚至可以过分地能育；除了显著易受有利和不利条件影响外，能育性是内在可变异的；第一次杂交的能育性以及由此产生的杂种的能育性在程度上并非一模一样；杂种的能育性和它与一亲种外观的相似性无关；最后，两个物种之间第一次杂交的难易，并不总是受制于分类的亲缘关系，即彼此相似的程度。最后这一点，已由同样两个物种之间的互交结果中表现的差异所明确证实了，其中某一物种用作父本或母本时，杂交的难易一般有某些差异，有时有极大的差异。而且，互交产生的杂种往往能育性有差异。

那么，这些复杂奇妙的规律，是否表明仅仅为着阻止自然状况中的混淆，物种才被赋予了不育性呢？我想未必。必须假定避免混淆对于各不同物种都是同等重要的，而为什么当各物种进行杂交时，不育性的程度会有如此极端的差异呢？为什么同一物种的个体中不育程度会内在地易于变异呢？为什么某些物种易于杂交，却产生很不育的杂种；而其他物种极难杂交，却产生很能育的杂种呢？为什么同样两个物种的互交结果中常常会有如此巨大的差异呢？甚至可以问，为什么会允许杂种的产生呢？既然赋予物种以产生杂种的特别能力，然后又以不同程度的不育性来阻止其进一步繁殖，而这又和亲种第一次结合的难易并无严格关联。这似乎是一种奇怪的安排。

相反，上述规律和事实，依我看清楚地表明了第一次杂交的和杂种的不育性，仅仅是伴随于或者是决定于杂交物种生殖系统为主的未知差异。差异是奇特的有限的，两物种的互交中，一个物种的雄性生殖质虽然常常能自由作用于另一物种的雌性生殖质，但不能反过来起作用。最好举例来充分解释我所谓的不育性是伴随其他差异而发生的，而不是特别赋予的一种性质。由于一种植物嫁接或芽接在其他植物之上的能力，对于它们在自然状态下的利益来说并不重要，所以我设想没有人会假定这种能力是特别赋予的性质，而承认这是伴随两种植物生长法则的差异而发生的。我们有时可以从树木生长速度的差异、木质硬度的差异、树液流动期间和树液性质的差异等等看出某一种树不能嫁接另一种树的理由；但是在很多情形下，却完全看不出任何理由来。无论两种植物大小差异巨大，无论木本草本，无论常绿落叶，也无论对于广泛不同气候的适应性，都不会总是阻止它们嫁接在一起。杂交的能力受分类系统的亲缘关系所限，嫁接也是如此，还没人能把属于不同科的树嫁接在一起；相反，密切近似的物种以及同一物种的变种，虽不是一律，却通常容易嫁接。但是这种能力和杂交中一样，并不是绝对受分类系统的亲缘关系所支配。虽然同一科许多不同的属可以嫁接，但是在另一些情形里，同属物种却不能彼此嫁接。梨和（quince）列为不同的属，梨和苹果列为同属，但是把梨嫁接在上远比嫁接在苹果上来得容易。甚至不同的梨变种在上的嫁接，其难易程度也有所不同；不同杏、桃变种在某些李变种上的嫁接，也是如此。

盖特纳发现同样两个物种的不同个体往往在杂交中会有内在的差异，萨哥瑞特（Sagaret）认为同样两个物种的不同个体在嫁接中也是如此。在互交中，结合的难易常常是很不相等的，在嫁接中也往往如此。例如，普通醋栗不能嫁接在黑穗醋栗（currant）上，然而黑穗醋栗却能嫁接在普通醋栗上，虽然难一些。

我们已经看到，具有不完全生殖器官的杂种的不育性和具有完全生殖器官的两个纯粹物种难于结合，是两回事，然而这两类不同情形在一定程度上是平行的。嫁接的情况类似；杜因（Thouin）发现刺槐属（Robinia）三个物种在本根上可以自由结籽，嫁接在其他物种上也不难，但嫁接后就不结实了。另一方面，花楸属（Sorbus）某些物种嫁接在其他物种上所结的果实，则比在本根上多一倍。后面这一点使我们想起朱顶红属、西番莲属等等的特别情形，由不同物种的花粉比由本株的花粉来受精，能够产生更多的种子。

因此，我们看出，虽然嫁接植物的单纯愈合和雌雄性生殖质在生殖中的结合之间有着明确的根本性区别，但是不同物种的嫁接和杂交的结果，还存在着大致的平行现象。正如我们必须把支配树木嫁接难易的奇异而复杂的法则，看作是伴随营养系统为主的一些未知差异而发生的一样，我相信支配第一次杂交难易的更为复杂的法则，伴随着生殖系统中一些未知差异而发生。这两方面的差异，如我们预料到的，在某种范围内是遵循着分类系统的亲缘关系的，所谓分类系统的亲缘关系，就是试图用以说明生物间的各种相似和相异的情况。这些事实似乎绝没有指明各不同物种在嫁接或杂交上难度大小是一种特别的禀赋；虽然在杂交的场合，这种困难对于物种类型的存续和稳定是重要的，而在嫁接的场合，这种困难对于植物的利益并不重要。




第一次杂交不育性和杂种不育性的原因。——现在可以细看一下第一次杂交和杂种的不育性的可能原因。这两者截然不同，刚刚说过，两个纯粹物种结合，具有完全生殖器官，而杂种的生殖器官不完全。即使第一次杂交，对于实现结合的困难程度，显然决定于几种不同的原因。有时雄性生殖质由于生理的关系，不可能到达胚珠，例如雌蕊过长以致花粉管不能到达子房的植物，就是如此。也有人观察过，把一个物种的花粉放在另一个远缘物种的柱头上时，虽然花粉管伸出来了，但并不能穿入柱头的表面。再者，雄性生殖质虽然可以到达雌性生殖质，但不能引起胚胎的发育，特莱对于墨角藻所做的一些试验，似乎就是如此。对于这些事实还无法解释，正如某些树为什么不能嫁接在其他树上一样。最后，也许胚胎可以发育，但早期即行死去。最后这一选项还没有得到充分的注意；但是在山鸡和家鸡的杂交工作上经验丰富的休伊特（Hewitt）先生曾给我转述过他的观察，我相信胚胎的早期死亡是第一次杂交不育性的最常见原因。一开始我不愿相信这种观点；因为杂种一旦产生，如我们所看到的骡的情形，一般是健康而长命的。然而，杂种在降生前后，是处于不同的环境条件之下的：如果杂种产生和生活在双亲所生活的地方，一般是处于适宜的生活条件之下的。但是，杂种只继承了母体的本性和体质的一半；所以产生之前，还在母体的子宫内或在由母体所产生的蛋或种子内养育的时候，可能已处于某种程度的不适宜条件之下了，因此就容易在早期死去；特别是一切极其幼小的生物，对于有害或不自然的生活条件是显著敏感的。

关于两性生殖质发育不全的杂种的不育性，情形很不相同。我已经不止一次提出过自己收集的大量事实，说明动植物离开其自然条件，生殖系统就极易受到严重的影响。事实上这是动物驯化的重大障碍。如此诱发的不育性和杂种的不育性之间，有许多相似之点。两者的不育性和一般的健康无关，且不育的个体往往身体肥大或异常茂盛。而且，不育性以不同的程度出现；雄性生殖质最易受影响，但是有时雌性比雄性受影响更厉害。两者不育的倾向在某种程度上和分类系统的亲缘关系是一致的，因为动植物的全群都是由于同样的不自然条件而招致不育的，并且全群的物种都有产生不育杂种的倾向。另一方面，一群中的一个物种时常会抵抗环境条件的巨变，而能育性无所损伤；而某些物种会产生异常能育的杂种。不试验，没有人能说，任何动物是否能够在圈养中生育，任何外来植物是否能够在栽培下自由地结籽；也不能说，一属中的任何两个物种究竟能否产生好歹不育的杂种。最后，如果生物在几个世代内都处在不是它们的自然条件下，就极易变异，我认为变异的原因是生殖系统受到特别的影响，虽然比引起不育性发生的那种影响为小。杂种也是如此，因为正如每一个试验者所观察到的，杂种的后代在连续的世代中也是极易变异的。

因此，我们可以看出，当生物处于新的不自然的条件之下时，以及当杂种从两个物种的不自然杂交中产生出来时，生殖系统都以相似方式蒙受不育影响，而与一般健康状态无关。在前一种情形下，生活条件受扰乱，虽然程度很轻微，以致觉察不到；在后一种情形下，也就是杂种，外界条件虽然保持一样，但是由于两种不同的构造和体质合为一体，体制便受到扰乱。两种体制混为一种，在发育上，周期性的活动上，不同部分和器官的相互关联上，以及其对生活条件的相互关系上，没有某种扰乱发生，几乎是不可能的。如果杂种能够互相杂交而生育，就会把同样的混成体制一代一代地传递给后代，因此毫不奇怪，不育性虽有某种程度的变异，但不致减弱。

必须承认，除非做一些模糊的假设，我们无法理解有关杂种不育性的若干事实。例如，互交产生的杂种，其能育性并不相等；再如，与一纯粹亲种偶然地、例外地密切类似的杂种，其不育性有所增强。我不敢说上述论点已经切中事物的根源；为什么生物置于不自然条件下就会变为不育，对此还不能解释。我试图阐明的仅仅是，在某些方面有相似之处的两种情形，同样造成不育的结果，一是生活条件受扰乱，一是体制因两种体制合二为一而受到了扰乱。

听起来好笑，我怀疑同样的平行现象也适用于类似的但很不相同的一些事实。生活条件的微小变化对于所有生物都是有利的，这是一个古老的几乎普遍的信念，而且建立在大量证据之上。我看到农民和园艺者就这样做，他们常常从不同土壤和气候的地方交换种子、块茎等等，然后再换回来。在动物病后复原的期间，显而易见生活习性上的几乎任何变化，都是有很大好处的。还有，关于动植物，充分证据证实，同一物种非常不同的个体之间杂交，也就是不同品系、亚种的杂交，会增强后代的生活力和能育性。根据第四章提到的事实，我认为，哪怕是雌雄同体，一定量的杂交是不可或缺的；而且最近亲属之间的近亲交配，若连续经过几代，而且生活条件保持不变，总要招致后代的衰弱不育。

因此，一方面，生活条件的微小变化对于所有生物都有利；另一方面，轻微程度的杂交，即已有微小变异的同一物种雌雄之间的杂交，似乎会增强后代的生活力和能育性。但是，我们看到，大变化，或者特定性质的变化，往往使生物变为多少不育；且大杂交，即大不同的生物，或者不同的物种雌雄杂交，会产生某种程度不育的杂种。我很难确信，这种平行现象是偶然还是错觉。上述两组事实似乎被某个共同的、不明的纽带联结在一起了，它在本质上和生命的原则相关。




变种杂交的能育性及其混种后代的能育性。——一个极有力的论点主张，物种和变种之间一定存在着某种本质区别，而且以前所有的话肯定有错误，因为变种彼此在外观上无论有多大差异，却十分容易杂交，且产生完全能育的后代。我充分承认这几乎完全属实。但观察自然状况下产生的变种时，就立刻困难重重；如果有两个向来认定的变种，杂交中有任何程度的不育性，大多数学者就会立刻把它们列为物种。例如，被大多数优秀植物学者认为是变种的蓝海绿和红海绿、报春花属和樱草，据盖特纳说在杂交中是颇为不育的，因此他便把它们列为无疑的物种了。如果我们这样循环论证下去，就必然要认可在自然状况下产生的一切变种都是能育的了。

如果转过来看一看家养状况下产生或者假定产生的变种，我们更要疑惑不解了。例如说德国狐狸犬比其他狗更容易与狐狸结合，某些南美洲的土著家狗和欧洲狗不能轻易杂交时，每个人心目中都会有一种解释，而且大概是正确的，即这些狗本来是从不同物种传下来的。但是，外观上有着广泛差异的很多家养变种，例如鸽子或圆白菜都有完全的能育性，是值得注意的事实，特别是当我们想起有何等众多的物种，虽然彼此极其密切近似，但杂交时却极端不育。然而，考虑到以下几点，可知家养变种的能育性并不那么引人注目。第一，可以阐明，两物种之间的区区外在差异并不能确定相互杂交的不育性程度，所以同样的规则适用于家养变种；第二，某些知名学者认为，长期的驯化过程倾向于在连续的杂种世代中消除不育性，因为一开始程度就轻。如果这一点属实，我们当然不应该指望发现在相近的生活条件下不育性出现又消失了。最后，我觉得这是最重要的一点，动植物新族是通过人类按部就班的无意识选择力量在家养条件下培育出来的，为了人类的使用和愉悦而生；既不想，也不能选择生殖系统的轻微变化，或者与生殖系统相关的其他体质差异。给几个变种提供同样的食物，一视同仁地对待，并不希望改变其一般生活习性。大自然在恒久的时代里，对于整个体制的作用是均匀和缓慢的，反正是为了各个生物本身的利益；于是可能直接或者更可能间接地通过相关生长，修改任何一个物种若干后代的生殖系统。有鉴于人类和大自然所进行的选择过程存在这种差别，结果若有差异，也就不足为奇了。

我一直以来说起同一物种的变种进行杂交，好像都是恒定能育的。但是，下面将扼要叙述的少数事例，就是存在一定程度不育性的证据，这似乎是无可辩驳的。这一证据，和我们相信无数物种的不育性的证据，至少是有同等价值的。这一证据也是从反对说证人那里得来的，他们把能育性和不育性千篇一律地作为区别物种的稳妥标准。盖特纳在自家花园培育了一个矮型黄籽的玉米品种，同时在近旁培育了一个高型红籽的品种，这一工作进行了数年之久；这两个品种虽然是雌雄异花的，但绝没有自然杂交。于是他用一类玉米的花粉在另一类的十三个花穗上进行受精，仅有一个花穗结了一些籽，也不过结了五粒种子，因为这些植物是雌雄异花的，所以人工授精的操作在这里不会发生有害的作用。我相信没有人会怀疑这些玉米变种是不同物种；有必要注意这样育成的杂种植物本身是完全能育的；所以，连盖特纳也不敢承认这两个变种是不同的物种了。

吉鲁·德·别沙连格（Girou de Buzareingues）杂交了三个葫芦变种，和玉米一样是雌雄异花的，他断言之间的差异愈大，相互受精就愈不容易。这些试验有多大的可靠性我不知道，但是萨格瑞特把试验的类型列为变种，他分类的主要根据是不育性的试验。

下面的情形就更值得注意了，乍看似乎是难以相信的，但这是如此优秀的观察者和反对说证人盖特纳在许多年内，对于毛蕊花属的九个物种所进行的无数试验的结果，即同种黄色变种和白色变种的杂交，比其同色变种的花粉授精，产生较少的种子。进而他断言，一个物种的黄色变种和白色变种与另一物种的黄色变种和白色变种杂交时，则同色变种之间的杂交比异色变种之间的杂交，能产生较多的种子。然而这些变种除了花的颜色以外，并没有任何不同之处，有时这一个变种还可从另一个变种的种子培育出来。

从我对某些蜀葵变种的观察，倾向于认为它们有类似的情况。

科尔路特工作的准确性已被其后的每一位观察者证实了，他证明了一项值得注意的事实，即普通烟草的一个变种，如与一个大不相同的物种进行杂交，比其他变种更能育。他对普通被称作变种的五个类型进行了试验，而且是极严格的试验，即互交试验，发现它们的杂种后代是完全能育的。但是这五个变种中的一个，无论用作父本或母本与黏性烟草（Nicotiana glutinosa）进行杂交，所产生的杂种，总是不像其他四个变种与黏性烟草杂交的杂种那样不育。因此，这个变种的生殖系统必定以某种方式某种程度上变异了。

有鉴于此；由于很难确定自然状态下的变种不育性，假定的变种若有任何不育性一般列为物种；由于人在生产最明确的家养变种时只选择外在性状，而并不想或者不能在生殖系统里产生隐秘的机能差异；从这几个考虑和事实看来，我想变种并不能证明其一般能育性是普遍出现的，它不能作为变种和物种之间的根本区别。依我看变种的一般能育性，不足以推翻我就第一次杂交和杂种一般不育性而非永远不育所取的观点，也就是，那不是一种特别禀赋，而是缓慢得到的变异的连带现象，特别是发生于杂交类型的生殖系统的变异。




除了能育性之外，杂种与混种的比较。——杂交物种的后代和杂交变种的后代，除了能育性以外，还可以在其他几方面进行比较。曾强烈希望在物种和变种之间划出一条明确界限的盖特纳，在种间杂种后代和变种间混种后代之间只能找出很少的而且依我看来是十分不重要的差异。另一方面，它们在许多重要之点上却是极其密切一致的。

这里将极其简略地讨论这一问题。最重要的区别是，在第一代里混种较杂种易于变异，但是盖特纳却认为经长期培育的物种所产生的杂种在第一代里是常常易于变异的；我本人也曾见过这一事实的显著例子。盖特纳进而认为极其密切近似物种之间的杂种，较极其不同物种之间的杂种易于变异；这表明变异性的差异程度是分级消失的。众所熟知，当混种和较为能育的杂种繁殖到几代时，后代的变异性都大极了；但是，还能举出少数例子，表明杂种或混种长久保持着一致的性状。然而混种在连续世代里的变异性也许较杂种为大。

混种的变异性较杂种大，我看完全不足为奇。因为混种的双亲是变种，而且大都是家养变种（关于自然变种只做过很少的试验），这意味着变异性大都是新近出现的，因此我们可以期待这种变异性常常会继续，而且叠加于光由杂交行为产生的变异性上面。首次杂交或者杂种在第一代的变异性相对于连续世代的极端变异来说微不足道，这是奇事，值得注意，因其涉及并且加强了我所提出的关于普通变异性的原因的观点：由于生殖系统对于变化了的生活条件是显著敏感的，所以生殖系统往往就无能，起码无法发挥正常机能来产生和双亲类型相同的后代。第一代杂种是从生殖系统未曾受到任何影响的物种传下来的（经过长久培育的物种除外），所以不易变异；但是杂种本身的生殖系统却已受到了严重的影响，所以其后代是高度变异的。

还是回转来谈谈混种和杂种的比较：盖特纳说，混种比杂种更易重现任一亲类型的性状；但是，如果属实，这也肯定不过是程度差别而已。盖特纳还坚持说，任何两个物种虽然彼此密切近似，但与第三个物种杂交，其杂种彼此差异很大，然而一个物种的两个很不相同的变种，如与另一物种进行杂交，其杂种彼此差异并不大。但是据我所知，这个结论是建立在一次试验上的，并且似乎和科尔路特所做的几个试验的结果正相反。

盖特纳所能指出的杂种植物和混种植物之间的不重要差异，也就是这个了。另一方面，混种和杂种形似各自的亲本，特别是从近缘物种产生出来的那些杂种，按照盖特纳的说法，也是依据同一法则的。两个物种杂交时，其中一个有时具有优势的遗传力迫使杂种像自己。我相信关于植物的变种也是如此；并且关于动物，肯定也是一个变种常常较另一变种具有这种优势的遗传力。从互交中产生出来的杂种植物，一般是彼此密切相似的；从互交中产生出来的混种植物也是如此。无论杂种或混种，如果在连续世代里反复地和任何一个亲本进行杂交，都会重现任一纯粹亲类型的性状。

这几点显然也适用于动物；但是部分地由于第二性征的存在，使得上述问题过于复杂，特别是由于物种间杂交和变种间杂交里某一性较另一性强烈地具有优势的遗传力。例如，我想那些主张驴较马具有优势遗传力的作者们说得对，无论骡或驴骡都更像驴而少像马；但是，公驴较母驴更强烈地具有优势的遗传力，所以由公驴和母马所产生的后代骡，比由母驴和公马所产生的后代驴骡更像驴。

某些作者特别着重只有混种后代密切相似于一方亲本的假设事实；但这种情形有时候杂种里也发生，我承认比混种里少得多。看一看我所搜集的事实，由杂交育成的动物，凡与一方亲本密切相似的，其相似之点似乎主要局限于性质上近于畸形和突然出现的那些性状——如皮肤白变症、黑变症（melanism）、无尾无角、多指多趾，而与通过选择慢慢获得的那些性状无关。于是，突然重现双亲任一方的完全性状的倾向，也是混种远比杂种更易发生。混种是由变种传下来的，常常是突然产生的，性状上是半畸形的；杂种是由物种传下来的，而物种则是慢慢而自然地产生的。总的来说，我完全同意普罗斯珀·卢卡斯博士的见解，他搜集了有关动物的大量事实后，得出如下的结论：不论双亲彼此的差异有多少，就是说，在同一变种个体的结合中，在不同变种个体的结合中，或在不同物种个体的结合中，子代类似亲代的法则都是一样的。

除了能育性和不育性的问题以外，物种杂交的后代和变种杂交的后代，在一切方面似乎都有普遍和密切的相似性。如果把物种看作是特别创造出来的，并且把变种看作是根据次级法则（secondary laws）产生的，这种相似性便会令人瞠目结舌。但这完全符合物种与变种之间无本质区别的观点。




本章提要。——差异足可列为物种的类型之间的第一次杂交以及它们的杂种，很普遍地但并非一律不育。不育性的程度不一，而且往往相差极微小，以致史上两位最谨慎的试验者根据这一标准也会在类型的排列上得出完全相反的结论。不育性在同一物种的个体里是内在地易于变异的，并且对于适宜和不适宜的生活条件是显著敏感的。不育性的程度并不严格遵循分类系统的亲缘关系，但由若干奇妙而复杂的法则支配。在同样两个物种的互交里不育性一般是不同的，有时是大为不同的。第一次杂交以及由此产生出来的杂种里，不育性的程度并非总是相等的。

在树的嫁接中，某一物种或变种嫁接在其他树上的能力，取决于植物生长系统的一般未知的差异；同样，在杂交中，一个物种和另一物种在结合上的难易，取决于生殖系统里的未知差异。之所以没有理由认为，物种被特别赋予了各种程度的不育性，以便防止自然状况下的杂交和混淆，是因为没有理由认为，树木被特别赋予了各种差不多的难嫁接性，以便防止树木在森林中接合。

纯粹物种的生殖系统是完善的，其第一次杂交的不育性似乎决定于几种条件，有时候主要决定于胚胎的早期死亡。杂种的生殖系统不完善，生殖系统乃至整个体制因两个不同物种的混合而扰乱，其不育性和自然的生活条件受到扰乱的纯粹物种所屡屡发生的不育性，似乎是密切近似的。这一观点有另一种平行现象的支持：只有微弱差别的类型之间的杂交，有利于后代的生活力和能育性；生活条件的微小变化有利于一切生物的生活力和能育性。两个物种的难以杂交及其杂种后代的不育性，纵然起因不同，其程度一般是相应的，这并不奇怪；因为两者都决定于杂交物种间的某种差异量。第一次杂交的容易和如此产生的杂种的能育，以及嫁接的能力——虽然嫁接能力显然决定于广泛不同的条件——在一定程度上统统与被试验类型的分类系统亲缘关系相平行，这也不奇怪。因为分类系统的亲缘关系试图表达一切物种的相似性。

公认为是变种，或者充分相似到足以被认为是变种的类型之间的第一次杂交，以及它们的混种后代，一般都是能育的，但不一定普遍如此。如果我们记得，我们是多么易于用循环法来辩论自然状态下的变种；如果我们记得，大多数变种是在家养状况下仅仅根据对外在差异的选择而产生出来的，而不是根据生殖系统的差异，则变种的几乎普遍而完全的能育性，就不值得奇怪了。除了能育性的问题之外，其他一切方面杂种和混种之间还有最密切而一般的相似性。最后，本章简单举出的一些事实，依我看似乎与物种与变种没有根本区别这一观点并不矛盾，甚至是支持这个观点呢。





第九章　论地质记录的不完全


论今日中间变种的不存在——论灭绝的中间变种的性质及其数量——从沉积速率和剥蚀速率来推算时间的经过——古生物标本的贫乏——地质层的间断——在任何一个地质层中中间变种的缺乏——物种群的突然出现——物种群在已知的最下化石层中的突然出现

第六章列举了对于本书所持观点的主要异议。异议大多数已经讨论过了。其中之一，即物种类型的区别分明以及物种没有无数的过渡环节把它们混淆在一起，是显而易见的难点。我曾举出理由来说明，为什么这些环节今日在显然极其有利于它们存在的环境条件下，也就是说在具有渐变的物理条件的广大而连续的地域上，通常并不存在。我曾尽力阐明，每一物种的生活更关键是取决于其他已经明确的生物类型，而非气候，所以具有真正支配力量的生活条件并不像热度湿度那样不知不觉地级进消失。我也曾尽力阐明，由于中间变种的存在数量比它们所连接的类型为少，在进一步的变异改进的过程中，一般要被淘汰和消灭。然而无数的中间环节目前在整个自然界中没有到处发生，主要原因当在于自然选择这一过程，因为通过这一过程新变种不断地代替消灭了它们的亲类型。正因为这种灭绝过程曾经大规模地发生作用，地球上既往生存的中间变种一定是大规模存在的。那么，为什么在各地质层（geological formation）和各地层（stratum）中没有充满这种中间环节呢？地质学的确没有揭示任何这种微细级进的生物环节；这大概是反对我的理论的最明显、最重要的异议，我相信地质记录的极度不完全可以解释这一点。

第一，应当永远记住，根据我的理论，何种中间类型肯定是既往生存过的。观察任何两个物种时，我难免要想象到直接介于它们之间的那些类型。但这是完全错误的观点；我们应当总是追寻介于各个物种及其共同的，但是未知的祖先之间的类型；而祖先一般在某些方面不同于全部变异后代。举一个简单的例证：扇尾鸽和球胸鸽都是从岩鸽传下来的；如果掌握了所有曾经生存过的中间变种，我们就会掌握这两个品种和岩鸽之间各有一条极其绵密的系列，但是没有任何变种是直接介于扇尾鸽和球胸鸽之间的。例如，结合这两个品种的特征——稍微扩张的尾部和稍微增大的嗉囊——的变种，是没有的。而且，两个品种已经变得如此不同，如果我们不知道有关其起源的任何历史的和间接的证据，而仅仅根据其和岩鸽在构造上的比较，就不可能去决定它们究竟是从岩鸽传下来的呢，还是从其他某一近似类型皇宫鸽（C. oenas）传下来的。

自然的物种也是如此，如果观察很不相同的类型，如马和貘（tapir），我们就没有理由可以假定直接介于它们之间的环节存在过，但可以假定马或貘和未知的共同祖先之间存在过环节的。共同祖先在整个体制上与马和貘具有极其普遍的相似；但某些个别构造上可能和两者有很大的差异，甚至超越两者之间的彼此差异。因此，在所有这种情形里，除非我们同时掌握了一条近于完全的中间环节链，否则哪怕将祖先的构造和它的变异后代加以严密的比较，也辨识不出任何两个物种以上的亲类型。

根据我的理论，两个现存类型中的一个来自另一个大概是可能的。例如马来自貘；这样，应有直接的中间环节曾经存在于它们之间。但是这种情形意味着一个类型极长期保持不变，而其子孙却发生了大量的变化；而生物与生物之间的竞争与亲子竞争原理将会使这种情况极少发生；因为，在所有情形里，改进的新生物类型都倾向于淘汰未改进的旧类型。

根据自然选择学说，一切现存物种都曾经和本属的亲种有联系，差异并不大于今日我们看到的同一物种的变种之间；这些目前一般已经灭绝了的亲种，同样又和更古老的物种有联系；如此反复回溯，总是会汇聚到每一个大纲（class）的共同祖先。所以，所有现存物种和灭绝物种之间的中间过渡环节的数量，必定不计其数。假如这一学说是正确的，那么这些环节必曾在地球上生存过。




论时间的经过。——除了未发现这样无限数量的中间环节的化石遗骸之外，另有一种反对意见认为，变化既然都是通过自然选择缓慢达到的，就没有时间足以完成如此大量的生物变化。如果读者不是地质学者，我几乎不可能使他领会一些事实，从而对时间经过有所了解。赖尔爵士的《地质学原理》（Principles of Geology）将被后世历史学家承认在自然科学中掀起了一场革命，凡是读懂这部大著作的人，如果不承认过去时代曾是何等久远，还是立刻把拙作收起来吧。只研究《地质学原理》、阅读不同观察者关于各地质层的专门论文，而且注意到各作者怎样试图对于各地质层，乃至各地层的持续时间提出的不妥概念，还是不够的。必须亲自考察层层相叠的地层，仔细观察大海如何碾碎古老的岩石，进行新的沉积，才能指望对过去的时间有所了解，而这时间的一分一秒在我们的周围比比皆是。

沿着由不很坚硬岩石所形成的海岸线漫步，注意看看陵削（degradation）过程是有好处的。在大多数情形里，达到海岸悬崖的海潮每天只有两次，且时间短暂，只有当波浪挟带着细沙砾石时才能侵蚀海岸岩崖；有良好的证据可以证明，清水对侵蚀岩石是没有什么效果的。最后，岩崖的基部终于被蚀空，大岩块倾落下来，碎块便固定在那里，然后一点一点地被侵蚀，直到体积缩小到能够被波浪翻滚的时候，才会很快地被磨碎成石子、砂或泥。但是我们常常看到后退的岩崖基部有圆形巨砾，密密覆盖着海产生物，表明它们很少被磨损，而且很少被翻滚！还有，如果我们沿着任何正在蒙受陵削作用的海岸岩崖行走几英里路，就会发现目前正在被陵削着的崖岸，不过只是短短的一段，或只是环绕海角，才断断续续存在着。地表和植被的外貌表明，基部被海水冲刷已经是许多年之前的事情了。

我认为，认真研究我国海蚀现象的人，会对岩石海岸侵蚀的缓慢印象深刻。休·米勒和约旦山的优秀观察者史密斯先生在这方面的观察，十分令人瞩目。有鉴于此，任何人可以去观察厚度达数千英尺的砾岩层，虽然形成速度也许比其他沉积岩快一些，但由于是磨损的鹅卵石组成，每一块都带有时间的印记，很好地表明了岩层积累的缓慢。请记住赖尔深奥的评语，沉积层的厚度和广度是地壳其他地方所受陵削的结果和程度。许多地方的沉积层隐含着多么巨量的陵削啊！拉姆齐教授把英国不同部分的连续地质层的最大厚度告诉过我，根据是大多数场合里的实测，少数猜测，其结果如下：

英尺

古生代层（火成岩层不在内） 57154

第二纪层 13190

第三纪层 2240



——合计72584英尺：折合成英里差不多有十三又四分之三英里。有些地质层在英格兰只是一薄层，而在欧洲大陆上却厚达数千英尺。另外，每一个连续的地质层之间，按照大多数地质学者的意见，空白时期也极久长。所以英国沉积岩的高耸叠积层，只能对于所经过的堆积时间提供不确切的观念，想必消耗了何等漫长的时间啊！优秀观察者估计，密西西比大河的沉积速度是上万年只有600英尺。这种估计可能有错，可是考虑到海流传送极薄的沉积层跨越何等广阔的空间，任何一个地区的积累过程想必是极其缓慢的。

可是不考虑被剥蚀物质的积累速度，许多地方的地层剥蚀量也许能提供时间经过的最佳证据。记得看到火山岛被波浪冲蚀，四面削去成为高达一两千英尺的直立悬崖时，我曾深受剥蚀证据的触动；由于以前的液体状态，熔岩流凝成缓度斜面，一眼就可看出，坚硬的岩层一度在大洋里伸展得何等辽远。断层（faults）把这同类故事说得更明白——即那些巨大的裂隙，地层沿着断层在这一边隆起，或者在那一边陷下，高度或深度竟达数千英尺；自从地壳破裂以来，而今地表已经因海蚀作用而变得如此完全平坦，以致在外观上已经看不出这种巨大位错的任何痕迹。

例如克拉文断层（Craven fault）延伸30多英里，沿着这一断层线，地层的垂直总变位自600到3000英尺不等。关于在盎格尔西（Anglesea）陷落达2300英尺的情形，拉姆齐教授曾发表过一篇报告；他告诉我说，他充分相信梅里奥尼斯郡（Merionethshire）有一个陷落竟达12000英尺。然而在这些情形里，地表上已没有任何东西可以表示这等巨大的运动了；裂隙两边的石堆已经夷为平地了。面对这种事实，使我得到一种印象，差不多就像去拿捏永恒这个概念一样无奈。

我还想举一个著名的个案，威尔德地带的剥蚀。必须承认，该地带的剥蚀是小菜一碟，跟拉姆齐教授大作里的相关个案相比不值一提，那可是古生代地层的大剥蚀，部分地块的厚度达到一万英尺啊。可是，站在北唐斯山上，眺望南唐斯山，就是生动的一堂课。只要记住西边不远处，北南峭壁合拢了，就可以有把握地浮想联翩，只见威尔德地带从白垩地层后期开始的有限时期内覆盖着岩石大圆顶。南北唐斯山的距离大约是22英里，而各个地层的厚度平均为1100英尺，这是拉姆齐教授告诉我的。如果按照某些地质学家设想的那样，威尔德地带下面分布着更古老的岩石带，其侧翼的沉积岩覆盖会积累得比其他地方薄，那么上述估计就错误了。不过，这种疑点来源大概不会大大影响对于该地区极西点的估计。假如我们知道大海通常侵蚀任何给定高度的悬崖线的速度，就可以衡量剥蚀威尔德地带的时间要求。当然这是不可能做到的，但我们为了大致形成这方面的概念，可以假定大海侵蚀500英尺高悬崖的速度是每世纪一英寸。一开始这显得太慢，但这相当于一码高的悬崖在整个海岸线上侵蚀速度大约每二十二年一码。我怀疑任何岩石会以这个速度被侵蚀，哪怕柔软的白垩，除非是暴露无遗的海岸。当然高耸的悬崖陵削更快，因为有碎块掉下。另外，我不相信，一二十英里长的海岸线整个锯齿面同时陵削。必须记住，几乎所有的地层都含有坚硬的岩层结核，长期抵御磨损，形成基底防波堤。所以在普通情况下，我断言500英尺高的悬崖，整段剥蚀每世纪一英寸足够多了。这样，根据上述数据，威尔德地带的剥蚀必定需要306662400 年，也就是三亿来年。

清水对于微坡的威尔德地带抬高后的作用不可能很大，但会少许减少上述估算。另外，我们知道这个地区出现过水平面波动，作为陆地可能存在过千百万年，因此逃避了海侵：浸入海底同样长时间，则逃避了海岸波的作用。所以，从第二纪后期开始，过去的世纪很有可能比3亿年长得多。

说这些话是因为我们很有必要得到一些岁月流逝的概念，管它多么不完善。每一年，全世界，陆地上和海水里居住着大批的生物类型。在漫长的年代里，想必有无数生物代代相传，头脑则无法加以把握！现在让我们看一看最丰富的地质博物馆，那里的陈列品是何等贫乏啊！




论古生物标本的贫乏。——大家都承认，古生物标本的搜集是极不完全的。永远不应忘记那位尊敬的古生物学者爱德华·福布斯的话，他说，大多数的化石物种都是根据单个的而且常常是破碎的标本，或者是根据某一个地点的少数标本而了解和命名的。地球表面只有一小部分曾做过地质学发掘，从欧洲每年的重要发现看来，可以说没有一处地方曾仔细发掘过。完全柔软的生物没有一种能够保存下来。落在海底的贝壳和骨骼，如果没有沉积物的掩盖，便会腐朽而消失。我认为我们始终采取了十分错误的观点，默认差不多整个海底都有沉积物正在进行堆积，并且其速度足够埋藏和保存化石的遗骸。海洋的极大部分都呈亮蓝色，这说明了水的纯净。记载下来的许多个案有，一个地质层经过长久间隔的时期以后，被另一后生的地质层整合遮盖起来，而下层在这间隔的时期中并未遭受任何磨损，这种情形，只有根据海底常常恒久不变的观点才可以得到解释。埋藏在沙子或砾层里的遗骸，遇到岩床上升的时候，一般会由于雨水的渗入而分解。我想，生长在海滩高潮与低潮之间的许多种类动物，难得保存下来。例如，藤壶亚科（Chthamalinlae，无柄蔓足类的亚科）的若干物种，在遍布全世界的海岸岩石上，数量非常之多。它们都是严格的海岸动物，除了在深海中生存的一个地中海物种在西西里被发现过化石以外，至今还没有在任何第三纪地质层里发现过任何其他物种；然而已经知道，藤壶属曾经生存于白垩纪。软体动物属石鳖（Chiton）的情况也差不多。

毋庸赘言，第二纪和古生代的陆栖生物，我们所搜集的化石证据是极其支离破碎的。例如，直到最近，除了赖尔爵士在北美洲石炭纪地层中发现一个外，在这两个广阔时代中还没有发现过其他陆地贝壳。关于哺乳动物的遗骸，看一眼赖尔的《手册》附录的历史表，就可明白真相，比细读文字能更好地理解遗骸保存是何等的偶然和稀少。只要记住第三纪哺乳动物的骨骼大部分是在洞穴或湖沼的沉积物里发现的，且没有一个洞穴或湖成层是属于第二纪或古生代的地质层，稀少就不足为奇了。

但是，地质记录的不完全主要还是由于另外一个比上述任何原因更为重要的原因：地质层被广阔的间隔时期所隔开。当我们看到著作中地质层的表格，或者实地考察时，就很难不相信它们是密切连续的。但是，例如根据默奇森（R．Murchison）爵士关于俄罗斯的巨著，我们知道该国重叠的地质层之间有着何等广阔的间隙；在北美洲以及世界的许多其他地方也是如此。如果最熟练的地质学者只把注意力局限在这等广大地域，那么他决不会想象到，在他的本国还是空白不毛的时代里，巨大沉积物已在世界其他地方堆积起来了，而且其中含有新而特别的生物类型。同时，如果在各个分离的地域内，对于连续地质层之间所经过的时间长度不能形成任何概念，那么我们可以推论在任何地方都不能确立这种概念。连续地质层的矿物构成屡屡发生巨变，一般意味着周围地域有地理上的巨大变化，因此便产生了沉积物，这与各个地质层之间曾有过极久的间隔时期的观点是相符合的。

我想，我们能理解为什么各区域的地质层几乎一律是间断的；就是说不是彼此紧挨着。最打动我的是，当我调查最近期间升高几百英尺的南美洲千百英里海岸时，竟没有任何近代的沉积物有足够的广度，可以持续哪怕是一个短的地质时代而不被磨灭。全部西海岸都有特别海产动物栖息着，可是那里的第三纪层非常不发达，大概没有各种连续而特别的海产动物的记录会保存到久远的年代。只要稍微一想，便能解释为什么沿着南美洲西边升起的海岸，不能到处发现含有近期，即第三纪的遗骸的大范围地质层，虽然在悠久的年代里沉积物的供给一定是丰富的，有海岸岩石的大量陵削和注入海洋里的泥河。无疑应当这样解释，即当海岸和近海岸沉积物一旦被缓慢而逐渐升高的陆地带到海岸波浪研磨作用的范围之内时，便会不断地被侵蚀掉。

我想，我们可以有把握地断言，沉积物必须堆积成极厚的、极结实的、极大的巨块，才能在最初升高和水平面波动的期间，抵御波浪的不断作用以及其后的大气陵削作用。这样又厚又大的沉积物堆积可由两种途径形成：一是在深海底进行堆积，按照E．福布斯的研究成果，我们断言，深海底极少有动物栖息，所以当大块沉积物上升之后，对于当时生存的生物类型所提供的记录是很不完全的；另一是在浅海底进行堆积，如果浅海底不断徐徐沉陷，沉积物就可以堆积到任何的厚度和广度。在后一种情形里，只要海底沉陷的速度与沉积物的供给差不多平衡，海就会一直是浅的，而且有利于生物生存，这样，一个富含化石的地质层便形成，而且在上升变为陆地时，厚度也足以抵抗大量的陵削。

我相信，所有的古代地质层，凡是富含化石的，都是这样在沉陷期间形成的。自从1845年我发表了关于这个问题的观点之后，就注意着地质学的进展，使我感到惊奇的是，当作者们讨论到这种或那种巨大地质层时，纷纷得出结论，是在海底沉陷期间堆积起来的。我可以补充说，南美洲西岸的唯一古代第三纪地质层肯定就是在水平面向下沉陷期间堆积起来的，并且由此达到了相当的厚度；这一地质层虽然厚度巨大，足以抵抗它曾经蒙受过的那种陵削作用，但今后将很难持续到久远的地质时代里去。

所有地质学事实都明白地告诉我们，每个地域都曾经过许多缓慢的水平面波动，而且波动的影响范围显然是很大的。结果，富含化石且广度和厚度足以抵抗其后陵削作用的地质层，在沉陷期间，是在广大的范围内形成的，但只限于沉积物的供给足以保持海水的浅度并且足以在遗骸未腐化以前把它们埋藏和保存起来的地方。相反，在海底保持静止的期间，沉积物就不能在最适于生物生存的浅海部分厚积。在上升的交替期间，这种情形就更少发生；确切些说，那时堆积起来的海床，由于升起和进入海岸作用的界限之内，一般都毁坏了。

于是，地质记录势必要断断续续的了。我对这种观点的正确性有把握，它们严格遵循赖尔爵士谆谆教导的一般原理，而且福布斯独立取得了类似的结论。

这里还有一句话值得稍加注意。在抬升期间，陆地面积以及连接的浅海滩面积将会增大，而且常常形成新的生物活动场所；——前面已经说过，所有环境条件对于新变种和新种的形成是极有利的；但是这期间地质记录上一般是空白的。另一方面，在沉陷期间，生物分布的面积和生物数目将会减少（最初分裂为群岛的大陆海岸除外），结果，沉陷期间虽然会发生生物的大量灭绝，但少数新变种或新物种却会形成；而且也是在这一沉陷期间，富含化石的沉积物将被堆积起来。几乎可以说，自然防止了过渡或者连接类型的频繁发现。

从上述的理由看，无疑地质记载从整体来看是极不完全的。但是，如果把注意力只局限在任一地质层上，就更难理解为什么始终生活在其中的亲缘物种之间，没有发现密切级进的诸变种。同一个物种在同一地质层的上部和下部呈现清晰的变种，这些情形有记载，但很稀少，可以忽略。虽然各地质层的沉积无可争论地需要极久的年代，还可以举出若干理由来说明，为什么都不包含一个级进的环节系列，介于当时生活的物种之间；但我对于下述理由，还不敢声称给予了相应的重视。

虽然各地质层可以表示一个极久时间过程，但比起一个物种变为另一个物种所需要的时间，也许还显得短些。古生物学者勃龙（Bronn）和伍德沃德（Woodward）曾经断言，各地质层的平均存续期间比物种类型的平均存续期间长两三倍。我知道他们的意见很值得尊重，但是，在我看来，有不可克服的许多困难阻碍着我们在这方面下任何恰当的结论。当我们看到一个物种最初在任何地质层的中央部分出现，就去推论它以前不曾在他处存在过的话，那是极其轻率的。还有，当我们看到一个物种在一个沉积层最上面部分形成以前就消灭，就去假定它在那时已经全部灭绝，也是同等轻率的。我们忘记了欧洲的面积和全世界比起来是何等的小，而全欧洲同一地质层的几个阶段也不是完全确切相关的。

我们可以稳妥地推论，一切种类的海产动物由于气候等的变化，都曾有大规模的迁徙；当我们看到一个物种最初在任何地质层中出现时，可能是那时刚刚迁移到这个区域中去的。例如，众所周知，若干物种在北美洲古生代层出现的时间比欧洲同样地层为早，显然从美洲的海迁移到欧洲的海是需要时间的。在考察世界各地最近沉积物的时候，到处都可看见少数至今依然生存的某些物种在沉积物中虽很普通，但在周围密接的海中则已灭绝；相反，某些物种在周围邻近海中现在虽很繁盛，但在这一沉积物中却是绝无仅有。考察一下欧洲冰期（只是一个全地质时期的一部分）生物的确认迁徙量，期间的海陆沧桑，气候的极端变化，以及时间的悠久经过，都是同一个冰期内发生的，这不失为很好的一课。然而在世界的任何部分，含有化石遗骸的沉积层，是否曾经在整个这一冰期于同一区域内连续进行堆积，是存疑的。例如，密西西比河口附近，在海产动物能够繁生的深度范围以内，沉积物不可能在整个冰期内堆积起来；我们知道，此期间美洲的其他地方曾经发生过巨大的地理变化。像在密西西比河口附近浅水中于冰期的某一分期内沉积起来的这等地层，在上升的时候，生物的遗骸由于物种迁徙和地理变化，大概会最初出现和消失在不同的水平面中。在遥远的将来，如果有一位地质学者调查这等地层，大概要下结论，那里埋藏的化石生物的平均持续过程比冰期的期间为短，而不说实际上远比冰期为长，这就是说，它们从冰期以前一直延续到今日。

为了在同一个地质层的上、下部得到介于两个类型之间的完全级进系列，沉积物必须在长久期间内连续进行堆积，以便来得及进行缓慢的变异过程；因此，这堆积物一定是极厚的，并且进行着变异的物种一定是在整个期间生活在同一区域中。但是我们知道，含有化石的厚地质层，只有在沉陷期间才能堆积起来；并且沉积物的供给必须抵消沉陷量，使海水深度保持平稳，才可以使同种物种在同一地方生活。但是，这种沉陷运动有使沉积物来源地沉没在水中的倾向，所以沉陷运动持续时，便会减少沉积物供给。事实上，沉积物的供给和沉陷量之间完全接近平衡，大概是一种罕见的偶然事情；因为不止一个古生物学者观察到在极厚的沉积物中，除了它们的上下限附近，通常是没有生物遗骸的。

各个单独的地质层似乎和任何地方的整个地质层相似，堆积一般也是间断的。正如常常看到的那样，一个地质层由极其不同的矿物层构成时，我们可以合理地去设想沉积过程曾经备受打扰，而洋流变化、不同沉积物的供应一般是旷日持久的地理变化造成的。哪怕极其细密地对一个地质层进行考察，也无法知道其沉积所耗费的时间长度。许多事例阐明，厚仅数英尺的岩层，却代表着其他地方厚达数千英尺、因而堆积需要莫大时间的地层，但不知情的人们会怀疑这样薄的地质层会代表长久时间的过程。还有，地质层的下层升高后，被剥蚀，再沉没，继而被同一地质层的上层所覆盖，这方面例子也很多。这表明它的堆积期间有何等广阔的间隔时期，容易被人忽视。更有甚者，巨大的硅化木依然像当年生长时那样直立着，这明显证明了沉积过程有许多长的间隔期间以及水平面的变化，如果没有树木碰巧保存下来，大概不会想到这一点的。例如，赖尔和道森先生曾在加拿大新斯科舍省（Nova Scotia）发现了1400英尺厚的石炭纪层，含有古代树根的层次，彼此相叠，不少于68层不同的水平面。因此，如果一个地质层的下、中、上部都出现了同一个物种，可能是这个物种没有在沉积的全部期间生活在同一地点，而是在同一个地质时代内曾经几度绝迹和重现。所以，如果这个物种在任何一个地质年代内发生了显著的变异，则地质层的截面也许不会含有我的理论上一定存在的全部微细的中间级进，而只是含有突然变化的类型，虽然也许是轻微的。

最重要的是要记住，学者们没有金科玉律来区别物种和变种；他们承认各物种都有细小的变异性，但当他们遇到任何两个类型之间有稍微大一些的差异量，除非有密切的中间级进把它们连接起来，否则就要把两个类型都列为物种。按照刚才所讲的理由，我们不可能希望在任何一个地质的截面中都看到这种连接。假定B和C是两个物种，并且在下面的地层中发现第三个A；哪怕A严格地介于B和C之间，除非它能同时被一些中间变种与上述任何一个类型或两个类型极密切连接起来，否则就会干脆被排列为第三个物种。不要忘记，如同前面所解释的，A也许是B和C的实际原始祖先，但在各方面构造并不一定严格地都介于两者之间。所以，我们可能从同一个地质层的下、上层中得到亲种和它的若干变异后代，不过如果没有同时得到无数的过渡级进，就辨识不出其血统关系，因而就不得不把它们排列为不同的物种。

众所周知，许多古生物学者是根据何等微小的差异来区别物种的。如果标本得自同一个地质层的不同层次，他们就更毫不犹豫了。某些有经验的贝类学者，现在已把多比内（D'Orbigny）等学者所定的许多极完全的物种降为变种了；根据这种观点，我们确能看到按照我的理论所应当看到的那类变化证据。而且，如果我们观察一下稍广阔的间隔时期，就是说观察一下同一个巨大地质层中的不同而连续的层次，就会看到埋藏的化石，虽然普遍被列为不同的物种，但彼此之间的关系比起相隔更远的地质层中的物种，要密切得多；但是这个问题只能留待下章再加讨论。

还有一个理由值得注意：关于繁殖快而移动不大的动植物，像前面已经看到的那样，有理由来推测，它们的变种最初一般是地方性的；这种地方性的变种，非到相当程度地改变完善了，不会广为分布去淘汰它们的亲类型的。按照这种观点，任何地方的一个地质层中要想发现任何两个类型之间的一切早期过渡阶段，机会是很小的，因为连续的变化被假定是地方性的，局限于某一地点。大多数海产动物的分布范围都是广大的；并且我们看到，植物里分布范围最广的，最常呈现变种；所以，关于贝类等海产动物，那些具有最广大分布范围的，远远超过已知的欧洲地质层界限以外的，最常先产生地方变种，终于产生新物种；因此，我们在任何一个地质层中追踪过渡诸阶段的机会又大大减少了。

不应忘记，今天有完美的标本供观察，却很少能用中间变种把两个类型连接起来，从而证明它们同种，除非从许多地方采集到许多标本。而在化石物种方面，学者极少能够做到多方采集。我们只要问问，例如，地质学者在某一未来时代能否证明牛羊、马狗各品种是从一个或几个原始祖先传下来的，又如，栖息在北美洲海岸的某些海贝实际上是变种呢，还是所谓的不同物种呢？（某些学者列为物种，不同于欧洲代表种，而另一些学者仅仅列为变种。）这样一问，我们恐怕就能最好地了解用大量微细的中间化石环节来连接物种是不可能的。未来的地质学者只有发现了化石状态的大量中间级进之后，才能证明这一点，而依我看这种成功是画饼充饥。

地质学研究虽然替现存和灭绝的属里增加了大量物种，并且使少数物种群之间的间隔比原来缩小，却并没有通过大量微细的中间变种把物种连接起来，从而打破物种之间的区别。由于这一点没有做到，也许成为反对我的观点的一个最重大最明显的异议。值得用一个想象的例证把上述诸原因总结一下。马来群岛的面积大约相当于从北角（North Cape）到地中海以及从英国到俄罗斯的欧洲面积；所以，除去美国的地质层之外，面积与多少精确调查过的全部地质层不相上下。我完全同意戈德温-奥斯汀（Godwin-Austen）先生的意见，马来群岛的现状（大量大岛屿被广阔的浅海所隔开），大概可以代表欧洲以前的状况，大多数地质层正在进行堆积。马来群岛是全球生物方面最丰富的区域之一，然而，如果把所有曾经生活在那里的物种都搜集起来，就会看出它们所代表的世界博物史是何等不完全！

但是我们有充分理由认为，马来群岛的陆栖生物在我们假定堆积在那里的地质层中，保存得极不完全。我想，严格的海岸动物，或生活在海底裸露岩石上的动物，被埋藏的不会很多；而且那些被埋藏在砾石和沙中的生物也不会保存到久远的时代。在海底没有沉积物堆积的地方，或者在堆积的速率不足以保护生物体免于腐败的地方，遗骸便不能保存下来。

在马来群岛，我想含化石地质层只能于沉陷期间形成，使其厚度足以延续到一个世代，在未来时代中延续的距离，不亚于过去第二纪层那样悠久。这等沉陷期间彼此要被巨大的间隔时期所分开，在这期间，地面要么保持静止要么继续上升；上升时，每个含化石地质层，会被不断的海岸作用随堆积随毁坏，就如我们现今在南美洲海岸所见到的那样。在沉陷期间，生物灭绝也许极多；在上升期间，大概会出现极多的生物变异，可是这个时候的地质记录极不完全。

群岛全部或一部分沉陷以及与此同时发生的沉积物堆积的任何漫长时间，是否会超过同一物种类型的平均持续期间，是可疑的；这等偶然的事情对于任何两个以上物种之间的一切过渡级进的保存是不可缺少的。如果这等级进没有全部保存下来，过渡的变种看上去只能像是许多不同的物种。各个沉陷的漫长期间还可能被水平面的波动所打断，同时在这样长久的期间内，轻微的气候变化也可能发生；在这等情形下，群岛的生物就要迁移，因而在任何一个地质层里就不能保存有关它们变异的紧密连接的记录。

群岛的多数海产生物，现在已超越了它的界限而分布到数千英里以外；以此类推，可以使我相信，主要是这些广为分布的物种，最常产生新变种。这等变种最初是地方性的，局限于一个地方，但当它们得到了任何明确的优势，或者进一步变异和改进时，就会慢慢地散布开去，并且把亲缘类型淘汰掉。当这等变种重返故乡时，因已不同于先前的状态，虽然其程度也许是极其轻微的，却是一刀切的，所以按照许多古生物学者所遵循的原理，它们大概会被列为不同的新物种。

如果这等说法有某种程度的正确性，我们就没有权利去期望在地质层中找到这等无限数目的、差别微小的过渡类型。按照我的理论，这些类型曾经把一切同群的过去物种和现在物种连接在一条长而分枝的生物环节中。我们只应寻找少数的环节，它们的彼此关系有的远些，有的近些；而这等环节，就算是极密切的，如果见于同一地质层的不同层次，也会被许多古生物学者列为不同的物种。我不讳言，如果不是在每一地质层的初期及末期生存的物种之间缺少无数过渡的环节，而对我的理论构成如此严重威胁的话，我将不会想到在保存得最好的地质断面中，生物突变的记录还是如此贫乏。




全群近似物种的突然出现。——物种全群在某些地质层中突然出现的事情，曾被某些古生物学者——如阿加西斯、匹克推特，特别是塞奇威克（Sedgwick）教授——看作是反对物种能够变迁这一观点的致命异议。如果同属或同科的大量物种真的一下子降生了，那么对于通过自然选择而缓慢变异的遗传学说，的确是致命的。因为依据自然选择，所有从某一个祖先传下来的一群类型的发展，一定是极其缓慢的过程；并且这些祖先一定在变异后代出现以前就已经生存很久了。但是，我们始终把地质记录的完全性估价得过高，并且由于某属或某科未曾见于某一阶段下面，就错误地推论在那个阶段以前没有存在过。我们常常忘记，整个世界与仔细调查过的地质层的面积比较起来，是何等巨大；我们还会忘记物种群在侵入欧洲和美国的古代群岛以前，也许在他处已经存在了很久，而且慢慢地繁衍着。我们也没有适当地考虑到在我们的连续地质层之间所经过的间隔时间——这一时间有时候大概要比各个地质层堆积起来所需要的时间更长久。这些间隔会给予充分的时间使物种从某一个、若干个亲类型繁衍下来；而这种物种在以后生成的地质层中好像突然创造出来似的出现了。

这里我要把以前说过的话再说一遍，即，一种生物对于某种特别的新生活方式的适应，例如空中飞翔，大概是需要长久连续的年代；但是，如果这种适应一旦成功，并且少数物种就此比别的物种获得了巨大的优势，那么只要较短的时间内，就能产生出许多分歧的类型来，从而迅速地、广泛地散布于全世界。

我现在举几个例子来证明前面的话，表明我们何等容易犯错误，去假定全群物种曾经突然产生。我可以再提一件大家熟知的事实，几年前发表的一些地质学论文中，都说哺乳动物纲是在第三纪开头才突然出现的。而现在已知的富含化石哺乳动物的堆积物之一，是属于第二纪层的中期的；并且在这个大纪刚刚开头的新红砂岩中发现了一头真的哺乳动物。居维叶一贯主张，任何第三纪层没有猴子出现过；但是，目前在印度、南美洲和欧洲甚至于更古的第三纪始新统中发现了猴的灭绝种。不过，最最触目惊心的个案是鲸科。这种海生动物骨骼巨大，全世界分布，所以第二纪地层没有发现一根鲸骨的事实，似乎充分证实了这个大目突然产生的观点，时间是第二纪末期与第三纪早期地层。可是，我们现在可以在1858年发表的赖尔《手册》增刊中看到鲸在上层海绿石砂中存在的明证，年代略早于第二纪末年。

我再举一例，这是我亲眼看到的，曾大受震动。我在一篇论化石无柄蔓足类的报告里曾说，根据现存的和灭绝的第三纪物种的大量数目，根据全世界——从北极区到赤道——栖息于从高潮线到50英寻各种不同深度区域的许多物种个体数目的异常繁多，根据最古的第三纪层中保存下来的标本的完整状态，根据甚至一个壳瓣（valve）的碎片也容易辨识：根据这一切情况，我曾推论如果无柄蔓足类生存于第二纪，就肯定会保存下来而且被发现；但因为这一时代的岩层中并没有发现过一个物种，我曾断言这一大群是在第三纪的开头突然发展起来的。这使我很痛苦，因为当时我想，这会给一个大群物种的突然出现增加一个事例。但我的著作行将出版的时候，老练的古生物学者波斯开（M．Bosquet）先生寄给我一张完整的标本图，无疑是一种无柄蔓足类，是他亲手从比利时的白垩层中采到的。就好像是为了使此个案尽可能触目惊心，这种蔓足类是属于很普通的、巨大的、遍地存在的一属，即藤壶属，而该属中甚至还没有一个标本在任何第三纪层中发现过。所以我们现在肯定知道蔓足类在第二纪存在过，而这些可能是许多现存第三纪物种的祖先。

有关全群物种分明突然出现的情况，古生物学者连篇累牍提到的，就是硬骨鱼类的个案，出现是在白垩纪深处。这一群鱼类包含现存物种的大部分。最近，匹克推特教授将它们的存在往前更加推了半个时期，某些古生物学者认为，某些更加古老的鱼类，其亲缘尚未完全弄清楚的，实际上就是硬骨鱼类。但是，假定如阿加西斯认为的全部硬骨鱼类真是在白垩层开头时出现的，这当然是值得高度注意的事实；除非同样能阐明这一物种群在全世界在同一时期内突然同时出现了，我看它并没有对我的理论造成不可克服的困难。赤道以南并没有发现过任何化石鱼类，对此就不必多说了；而且通读匹克推特的古生物学，当可知道欧洲的几个地质层也只发现过很少物种。少数鱼科现今的分布范围是有限的；硬骨鱼类先前大概也有过相似的有限分布范围，只是在某一个海里大事发展之后，才广泛地分布开来。同时我们也无权假定世界上的海像今天一样从南到北总是自由开放的。甚至在今天，如果马来群岛变为陆地，印度洋的热带部分就会形成一个完全封锁的巨大盆地，那里海产动物的任何大群都可能繁衍起来；直到其中某些物种适应了较冷的气候，并且能够绕过非洲或澳洲的南方海角，因而到达远处的海洋之前，也就局限在那里。

根据这等考虑，主要是我们对于欧洲和美国以外地方的地质学的无知，近十余年来的发现所掀起的古生物学知识革命，我认为对于全世界生物演替问题进行独断，犹如学者在澳洲的不毛之地待了五分钟就来讨论那里生物的数量和分布范围一样，都是太轻率了。




近似物种群在已知的最下化石层中的突然出现。——还有一个相关难点，更加严重。我是指同一群的物种在已知的最下化石岩层中突然出现的情形。使我相信同群的一切现存物种都是从单一的祖先传下来的论据，大多数也同样有力地适用于最早的既知物种。例如，我不能怀疑一切志留纪的三叶虫类（trilobites）都是从某一种甲壳动物传下来的，这种甲壳类一定远在志留纪以前就已生存了，并且和任何既知的动物可能都大不相同。某些最古的志留纪动物，如鹦鹉螺（Nautilus）、海豆芽（Lingula）等等，与现存物种并无多大差异；按照我的理论，不能假设这些古老的物种是所属目的一切物种的原始祖先，因其不具有任何程度的中间性状。而且，即使它们是这些目的祖先，当然也早就被大量的改进后代所淘汰消灭了。

所以，如果我的理论正确，毋庸置疑远在志留纪最下层沉积以前已经过了长久的时期，这与从志留纪到今日的整个时期一样长，或者更长久多了；而且在这样广大的不为人知的时期内，世界上充满了生物。

至于浩瀚的原始时期内，为什么未发现记录呢？关于这一问题我还不能给予圆满的解答。以默奇森爵士为首的卓越的地质学者坚信，我们在志留纪最下层所看到的生物遗骸，是地球生命的最初曙光。其他极有能力的鉴定者则反对这一结论，如赖尔和福布斯。我们不要忘记，精确知道的，不过是这个世界的一小部分。不久以前，巴兰德（M．Barrande）在志留系之下，增添了另一个更下面的时期，饱含奇特的新物种。他所谓的原生区下面有龙敏德岩层（Longmynd），那里检测到了生命迹象。甚至在某些最低等的无生岩（azoic rock）中，也有磷酸盐结核和沥青物质存在，也许表明该时期曾有生命存在。按照我的理论，志留纪之前无疑在某些地方积累了大堆大堆的含化石岩层，可是要理解它们的不存在谈何容易。如果说那些最古的岩层已经由于剥蚀作用而完全消失，或者说由于变质作用而整个消灭，我们只消在年代继它们之后的地质层中发现微小的残余物，且这残余物应该一般是以变质状态存在的。但是，我们所拥有的关于俄罗斯和北美洲的巨大地面上的志留纪沉积物的描述，并不支持一个地质层越古越蒙受极度的剥蚀和变质作用这样的观点。

目前这种个案还无法解释，因而真的会被当作有力的论据来反对本书所持的观点。为了指出下文可能得到某种解释，我提出以下的假说。根据欧洲和美国各地质层中生物遗骸的性质——它们似乎没有在深海中栖息过，并且根据构成地质层的厚达数英里的沉积物的量，我们可以推论产生沉积物的大岛屿或大陆地，始终是处在欧洲和北美洲的现存大陆附近。但是我们不知道在若干连续地质层之间的间隔期间，事物的状态曾经是怎样的；不知道欧洲和美国在这些间隔期间究竟是干燥的陆地，还是没有沉积物的近陆海底，还是广阔的、深不可测的海底。

看看现今的海洋，是陆地的三倍，还散布着许多岛屿；但我们知道，几乎没有一个真正的海洋岛提供过一件古生代或第二纪地质层的残余物。因此，也许可以推论，在古生代和第二纪，大陆和大陆岛屿没有在今日海洋的范围内存在过；因为，如果存在过，那么古生代层和第二纪层就大有可能由它们磨损的沉积物堆积起来，且由于在非常长久时期内肯定会发生水平面的波动，至少有一部分隆起了。于是，如果这等事实有推论价值，那么就可以推论，在现今海洋展开的范围内，自从有任何记录的最古远时代以来，都是海洋的存在；另一方面也可以推论，在现今大陆存在的处所，也是大片陆地的存在，自从志留纪以来无疑遭受了巨大的水平面波动。我论珊瑚礁一书中所附的彩色地图，使我做出结论，各大洋至今依然是沉陷的主要区域，大的群岛依然是水平面波动的区域，大陆依然是上升的区域。但是我们有权设想，自远古以来事情就是这样的吗？大陆的形成，似乎由于多次水平面波动，上升力量占优势所致；但优势运动的地域，难道在时代的推移中没有变化吗？远在志留纪以前的一个时期，现今海洋展开的处所，也许有大陆存在，而现今大陆存在的处所，也许有清澈广阔的海洋存在。例如，如果太平洋海底现在变为大陆，就算那里有比志留纪层还古的沉积层曾经沉积下来，我们也无权假定应该在那里找到它们。因为这些地层，由于沉陷数英里到更接近地心的地方，并且由于上面有水的非常巨大的压力，很可能比始终接近地球表面的地层要遭受远为严重的变质作用。世界上某些地方裸露变质岩的广大区域，如南美洲，一定曾在巨大压力下遭受过灼热，我总觉得这等区域需要专门的解释；大概可以相信，在这广大区域里可以看到许多远在志留纪以前的地质层是处在完全变质的状态之下的。

这里所讨论的几个难点是，在连续的地质层中许多介于现今生存和既往曾经生存的物种之间，并没有发现无数的过渡环节；欧洲的地质层中，有成群的物种突然出现；按现在所知，志留纪层以下几乎全无含化石地质层——这一切无疑都是性质极其严重的难点。所有最卓越的古生物学者，即居维叶、欧文、阿加西斯、巴兰德、福尔克纳、福布斯等，以及所有最伟大的地质学者，如赖尔、默奇森、塞奇威克等，都一致而且常常猛烈地坚持物种的不变性。因此，我们清楚地看到上述难点的严重性了。但是，我有理由相信，大权威赖尔爵士经过进一步斟酌，对于这个主题持严重的怀疑了。我觉得跟这些大权威分庭抗礼不胜唐突之至，我跟其他人一样，所有的知识都归功于他们。那些认为自然地质记录多少是完全的人们，不重视本书提出的其他事实和论据的人们，无疑会毫不犹豫地反对我的理论的。至于我自己，则遵循赖尔的比喻，把自然地质的记录看作是一部已经散失不全，并且用变化着的方言写成的世界历史；在这部历史中，我们只有最后的一卷，而且只涉及两三个国家。在这一卷中，又只是在这里或那里保存了一个短章；每页只有寥寥几行。慢慢变化着的史家语言的每个字，在断断续续的各章中又多少有些不同，可能表达了埋藏在连续而相互隔开的地质层中的、表面上突变的诸生物类型。按照这种观点，上面所讨论的难点就可以大事化小，小事化无了。





第十章　论生物的地质演替


新物种慢慢地陆续出现——论其不同的变化速率——物种一旦灭亡即不再出现——出现和消灭时物种群与单一物种所遵循的一般规律一样——论灭绝——论全世界生物类型同时发生变化——灭绝物种相互间及其与现存物种的亲缘——论古代类型的发展状况——论同一区域内同一模式的演替——前章和本章提要

现在来看一看，与生物在地质上的演替有关的若干事实和法则，究竟是与物种不变的普通观点相一致呢，还是与物种通过传承和自然选择缓慢地、逐渐地发生变化的观点相一致呢。

无论在陆上和水中，新的物种是极其缓慢地陆续出现的。赖尔曾阐明，第三纪的若干阶段里有这方面的证据，这几乎是不可能加以反对的；而且每年都倾向于把各阶段间的空隙填充起来，使灭绝类型与现存类型之间的比例更加成为渐进系统。在某些最近代的岩层里（如果用年来计算，当然确属极古代的），不过一两个物种是灭绝了的类型，并且其中只有一两个新的类型，第一次出现，或者是地方性的，或者据我们所知，是遍于地球表面的。如果信任西西里岛菲利皮（Philippi）的观察，该岛海水生物有许多连续的变化，但是循序渐进。第二纪地质层是比较间断的；但据勃龙说，埋藏在各层里的许多灭绝物种的出现和消灭都不是同时的。

不同纲和不同属的物种，并没有按照同一速率或同一程度发生变化。在最古老的第三纪层里，在大批灭绝的类型中还可以找见少数现存的贝类。福尔克纳曾就同样事实举出过一个显著例子，喜马拉雅山下的沉积物中有一种现存的鳄鱼与许多消灭了的奇怪哺乳类和爬行类在一起。志留纪的海豆芽与本属的现存物种差异很小；然而志留纪的大多数其他软体动物和所有甲壳类已经大变了。陆栖生物似乎比海栖生物变得快，瑞士最近观察到了这种动人的例子。有理由相信，高等生物比低等生物的变得要快得多，尽管这一规律是有例外的。按照匹克推特的说法，生物的变化量并不严格对应于地质层的演替，所以两个连续地质层之间生物类型的变化程度很少是一模一样的。然而，如果我们只把密切关联的地质层比较一下，可发现一切物种都进行过某种变化。如果一个物种一度从地球表面上消失，有理由相信同样的类型不会再出现。只有巴兰德所谓的“殖民动物”对于后一规律是一个极明显的例外，在一个时期内侵入到较古的地质层里，于是使既往生存的动物群又重新出现；但赖尔的解释似乎可以令人满意，他说这是从断然不同的地理区域来的暂时移民的个案。

这些事实与我的理论很一致。我不赞成一成不变的发展定律，让一个地域内所有生物都突然地、同时地，或者同等程度地发生变化。变异的过程一定是极缓慢的。各物种的变异性与所有其他物种没有依赖。至于这种变异是否会通过自然选择而得到利用，是否好歹被积累起来，因而引起变异物种或多或少的变异量，则取决于许多复杂的偶发事件——取决于具有有利性质的变异、互交力量、繁育速度、当地缓慢变化的物理条件，特别是与变化着的物种相竞争的其他生物的性质。因此，毫不奇怪，某一物种保持相同形态比其他物种长久得多；或者，纵有变化，也变化得较少。我们在地理分布上看到了同样的情况，例如，马德拉的陆栖贝类和鞘翅类昆虫，与欧洲大陆上的最近亲缘差异很大，而海栖贝类和鸟类却没有改变。根据前章所说，高等生物对于有机和无机的生活条件有着更为复杂的关系，我们大概就能理解陆栖生物和高等生物比海栖生物和低等生物的变化速度显然要快得多。当任何地区的许多生物已经变异和改进，我们根据竞争的原理以及生物与生物间许多重大关系的原理，就能理解不曾在某种程度上发生变异和改进的任何类型都易于被消灭。因此，我们如果观察足够长的间隔时间，就可以明白为什么同一个地方的一切物种终究都要变异，因为不变异就要归于灭绝。

同纲的各成员在长久而相等期间内的平均变化量也许近乎相同；但是，富含化石的、持续久远的地质层的堆积有赖于沉积物在沉陷地域的大量沉积，所以现在的地质层几乎必须在广大的、不规则的间歇期间内堆积起来；结果，埋藏在连续地质层内的化石所显示的有机变化量就不相等了。按照这一观点，每个地质层并不标志着一出神创论的新戏，而不过是节奏缓慢的戏剧里随便拉出的一个场景罢了。

我们能够清楚理解，为什么物种一旦灭亡了，纵使有完全一样的有机无机的生活条件再出现，也决不会再出现了。因为物种的后代虽然可以在自然组成中适应并且占据另一物种的确切位置（这种情形无疑曾无数次发生），从而把它淘汰掉；但是新旧两个类型不会完全相同，几乎肯定都从各自不同的祖先遗传了不同的性状。例如，如果扇尾鸽都毁灭了，养鸽者长期努力复原，可能育出一个和现有品种很难区别的新品种来。但原种岩鸽如果也同样被毁灭掉，我们有充分理由相信，在自然状况下，亲类型一般要被改进了的后代所淘汰消灭，于是，就很难相信与现存品种相同的扇尾鸽，能从任何其他鸽种，甚至从任何其他十分稳定的家鸽族育出来，因为新形成的扇尾鸽几乎肯定会从新祖先那里遗传某种轻微不同的性状。

物种群，即属和科，在出现和消灭上所遵循的一般规律与单一物种相同，变化有缓急，程度也有大小。一个群，一经消灭就永不再现；也就是说，它的生存无论延续到多久，总是连续的。我知道这一规律有几个显著的例外，但例外少得惊人，连福布斯、匹克推特和伍德沃德（虽然都坚决反对我所持的观点）都承认这个规律的正确性。而且这一规律与我的理论是严格一致的。因为同群的所有物种都是从一个物种传下来的，很明显只要该群的任何物种在漫长的时代中出现，其成员就必定延续到那么久，以便产生变异新种或者未变异旧类型。例如，海豆芽属的物种，必定连续存在，形成一条连绵不断的世代系列，从下志留纪地层直到今天。

上一章里看到，物种的全群有时会呈现一种假象，好似突然出现的；我试着提出了一种解释，如果正确，对我的观点会是致命伤。但是这种个案确是例外；一般规律是物种群逐渐增加数目，一旦增加到极大值，又迟早要逐渐减少。如果一个属里的物种数，一个科里的属数目，用粗细不同的一条竖线来表示，穿越发现物种的连续地质层，则竖线有时虚假地表现为在下端起始，并不是尖锐的点，而是突然露头；随后竖线向上加粗，同一粗度常常可以保持一段距离，最后在上层岩床中变细消失，表示此物种减少，最后灭绝。一个群的物种数的这种逐渐增加，与我的理论是严格合拍的。因为同属的物种和同科的属只能缓慢地、累进地增加；变异的过程和一些近似类型的产生必然是缓慢渐进的过程——一个物种先产生两三个变种，再慢慢地转变成物种，又以同样缓慢的步骤产生别的物种，如此下去，就像一株大树从一条树干上抽出许多分枝一样，直到变成大群。




论灭绝。——至此我们只是附带谈到了物种和物种群的消失。根据自然选择学说，旧类型的灭绝与改进的新类型的产生是有密切关系的。认为地球上一切生物在连续时代内被灾变一扫而光的旧观念，已被普遍抛弃了，就连埃利·德·博蒙（Elie de Beaumont）、默奇森、巴兰德等地质学者也在内，他们的一般观点会自然地引导他们达成这种结论。另一方面，根据对第三纪地质层的研究，我们有充分理由相信，物种和物种群先从一地，然后从又一地，终于从全世界挨次地、逐渐地消灭。单一的物种也好，物种的全群也好，它们的延续期间都极不相等：如我们所见到的，有些群从已知的生命曙光时代起一直延续到今，而有些群在古生代结束之前就消灭了。似乎没有一条定律可以决定任何一个物种、属能够延续多长时期。有理由相信，物种全群的消灭过程一般要比产生过程为慢；如果出现和消灭照前面所讲的用粗细不同的竖线来表示，可见表示灭绝进程线的上端的变细，要比表示初次出现和物种数增多的下端来得缓慢，然而，在某些情形里，全群的灭绝曾经奇怪地突然发生了，例如接近第二纪末的菊石。

物种灭绝的整个主题搞得扑朔迷离，真是莫名其妙。有些作者甚至假定，物种就像个体有一定的寿命那样有一定的存续期。大概不会有人像我那样曾对物种的灭绝感到如此惊奇。我惊讶地在拉普拉塔发现乳齿象（Mastodon）、大懒兽（Megatherium）、箭齿兽（Toxodon）等灭绝怪物的遗骸中嵌着马齿，它们在最近的地质时代曾与今日依然生存的贝类一起共存。鉴于自从马被西班牙人引进南美洲以后，就在全境变成为野生的，且以无比的速率增加数量，我问自己，在这样分明极其有利的生活条件下，是什么东西把以前的马在这样近的时代消灭了呢。但是我的惊奇是毫无根据的！欧文教授即刻看出，牙齿虽然与现存的马齿如此相像，却属于灭绝的马种，如果这种马至今依然存在，只是稀少些，任何学者对于此一点也不会感到惊奇；因为稀少现象是所有地方所有纲里的大多数物种的属性。如果我们自问，为什么这一物种或那个物种会稀少呢？可以回答，生活条件有些不利；但是，哪些不利呢，不得而知。假定化石马至今仍作为稀少物种存在，我们根据与所有其他哺乳动物（甚至包括繁殖率低的象）的类比，根据家养马在南美洲的归化历史，肯定会感到在更有利的条件下，它一定会在很少几年内布满整个大陆。但是我们无法说出抑制它增加的不利条件是什么，是由于某种偶然事故呢，还是由于几种偶然事故？也不知马一生中的什么年龄，在什么程度上这些生活条件各自发生作用的。如果条件转向不利，不管如何缓慢，我们确实不会觉察出，然而化石马必定渐渐地稀少，而终至灭绝——于是它的地位便被成功的竞争者取而代之。

实在很难始终记住，各种生物的增加，不断受到察觉不到的敌对作用的抑制；而且其作用完全足以使它稀少，以致最后灭绝。更近的第三纪地质层里，看到许多先稀少而后灭绝的情形；我们知道，通过人为的作用，一些动物之局部或全部的灭绝过程，也是一样的。我愿意重复一下我在1845年发表的文章，认为物种一般是先稀少，然后灭绝——对于物种的稀少并不感到奇怪，而当物种灭绝却大感惊异，这就好像认为病是死的前驱一样——对于病并不感到奇怪，而对病人死去却感到惊异，以致怀疑他是死于未知暴力一样。

自然选择学说的根据是，各个新变种，最终是各个新物种，由于比竞争者占有某种优势而产生和保持下来；较为不利类型的最终灭绝，几乎是不可避免的结果。家养生物也同样，新的稍微改进的变种培育出来，首先就要淘汰掉同地块改进较少的变种；当它大有改进，就会像我们的短角牛那样被运送到远近各地，并在他处取其他品种的地位而代之。这样，新类型的出现和旧类型的消失，不论是自然产生还是人工产生的，就联结在一起了。在某些繁盛的群里，一定时间内产生的新物种类型的数目，大概要比灭绝的旧物种类型为多；但是我们知道，物种并不是无限继续增加的，至少在最近的地质时代内是如此，所以，注意一下晚近的时代，我们就可以相信，新类型的产生引起了差不多同样数目的旧类型的灭绝。

如同前面解释过的和实例说明过的那样，在各方面彼此最相像的类型之间，竞争也一般最为剧烈。因此，改进和变异的后代一般会招致亲种的灭绝；而且，如果许多新类型是从任何一个物种发展起来的，那么这个物种的最近亲缘，即同属的物种最易灭绝。因此，我相信，一物种传下来的若干新物种，即新属，终于会淘汰同科的一个旧属。但也屡屡有这样的情形，即某一群的一个新物种夺取了别群的一个物种的地位，因而招致它的灭绝。如果许多近似类型是从成功的侵入者发展起来的，势必有许多类型要让出地位；被消灭的通常是近似类型，一般由于共同遗传了某种劣性而受到损害。但是，让位给其他变异和改进物种的那些物种，无论是属于同纲或异纲，总还有少数可以保存一个长久时间，因为适于某些特别的生活方式，或者因为栖息在远离、孤立的地方，从而逃避了剧烈的竞争。例如，三角蛤属（Trigonia）是第二纪地质层里的贝类大属，其一个物种还残存在澳洲的海里，而且硬鳞鱼类（Ganoid）这个几乎灭绝的大群中的少数成员，至今还栖息在我们的淡水里。所以我们看到，物种群的彻底灭绝要比产生过程缓慢。

关于全科或全目的明显突然灭绝，如古生代末的三叶虫和第二纪末的菊石，我们必须记住前面已经说过的情形，即在连续的地质层之间大概间隔着广阔的时间，期间可能发生了大批很缓慢的灭绝。还有，如果一个新群的许多物种，由于突然的移入，或者异常迅猛的发展，而占据了一个新地区，那么，许多的旧物种就会以相应快的速度灭绝。这样让出地位的类型普遍都是那些近似类型，因为共同具有某种劣性。

因此，在我看来，单一物种以及物种全群的灭绝方式是与自然选择学说十分合拍的。我们对于物种灭绝不必惊异；一定要惊异的话，还是对我们的自以为是表示惊异吧——一时想象自己理解了决定各个物种生存的许多复杂偶然性。各个物种都有过度增加的倾向，而且有我们很少察觉得出的某种抑制作用常在活动，我们一旦忘记这一点，整个自然组成就会弄得莫名其妙。每当我们能够确切说明为什么这个物种的个体会比那个物种多；为什么这个物种，而不是那个物种能在某一地方归化；那么，只有到了那时，才能对于为什么说明不了这一物种或者物种群的灭绝，理所当然地表示惊异。




论全世界生物类型几乎同时发生变化。——生物类型在全世界几乎同时发生变化，古生物学发现很少有比这个事实更令人震撼的了。例如，欧洲的白垩层在极不同气候下，世界许多遥远地方都能辨识出来，虽然那里没有发现一块白垩矿物，也就是在北美洲，在南美洲赤道地带，在火地，在好望角，以及在印度半岛。在这些遥远的地方，某些岩层的生物遗骸与白垩生物遗骸呈现了明显无误的相似性。见到的并不见得是同一物种，某些情形里没有一个物种是完全相同的，但它们属于同科、同属和亚属，而且有时仅在细微之点上，如表面上的斑条，具有相似的特性。还有，未曾在欧洲白垩层中发现的，但在它的上部或下部地质层中出现的其他类型，同样未出现在世界上的这些遥远地方。若干作者曾在俄罗斯、西欧和北美的若干连续的古生代层中观察到生物类型具有类似的平行现象。按照赖尔的意见，欧洲和北美洲的若干第三纪沉积物也是这样的。哪怕完全不考虑新旧世界所共有的少数化石物种，分隔很大的古生代和第三纪时期的历代生物类型的一般平行现象仍然是显著的，而且若干地质层的相互关系也容易确立。

然而，这些观察都是关于世界各地的海栖生物的：我们还没有充分数据可以判断相隔遥远的陆栖生物和淡水生物是否也同样发生平行的变化。我们可以怀疑它们是否曾经这样变化过：如果把大懒兽、磨齿兽（Mylodon）、长颈驼（Macrauchenia，大弓齿兽）和箭齿兽从拉普拉塔带到欧洲，而不说明它们的地质信息，大概没有人会猜测它们曾经和依然生存的海栖贝类共同生存过；但是，由于这些异常的怪物曾和乳齿象和马共同生存过，所以至少可以推论它们曾经在第三纪的某一晚近时期内生存过。

说到海栖生物类型曾经在全世界同时发生变化，决不可假定这种说法是指同一千年，同十万年，也不可假定它有很严格的地质学意义；因为，如果把现在生存于欧洲的、曾经在更新世（如用年来计算，这是一个包括整个冰期的很遥远的时期）生存于欧洲的一切海栖动物与现今生存于南美洲、澳洲的海栖动物加以比较，再熟练的学者也很难指出，极其密切类似南半球那些动物的是欧洲的现存动物还是欧洲更新世的动物。还有几位高明的观察者主张，美国的现存生物与曾经在欧洲第三纪后期的那些生物之间的关系，比它们与欧洲的现存生物之间的关系更为密切；如果属实，现在沉积于北美洲海岸的化石层，今后显然会与欧洲较古的化石层归为一类。然而，如果展望遥远将来的时代，我看毫无疑问，一切较近代的海成地质层，即欧洲的、南北美洲和澳洲的上新世上层、更新世层以及严格的近代层，由于含有多少类似的化石遗骸，由于不含有只见于较古的下层堆积物中的那些类型，在地质学的意义上是可以正确列为同时代的。

在上述的广义里，生物类型在世界上远隔的地方同时发生变化的事实，曾经大大地触动了那些可敬的观察者，如德韦纳伊（MM．de Verneuil）和达尔夏克（d'Archiac）。说过欧洲各地方古生代生物类型的平行现象之后，他们又说：“我们如果被这种奇异的序列所触动，而把注意力转向北美洲，并且在那里发现一系列的类似现象，那么可以肯定所有这些物种的变异灭绝，以及新物种的出现，决不能仅仅看海流的变化或多少局部和暂时的他种原因，而是依据支配整个动物界的一般法则。”巴兰德先生曾经有力地说出大意完全相同的话。把海流、气候等物理条件的变化，看作是处于极其不同气候下的全世界生物类型发生这等大变化的原因，诚然是太无聊了。正如巴兰德所指出的，我们必须看某一特殊法则。如果我们讨论到生物的现在分布情形，看到各地方的物理条件与生物本性之间的关系是何等淡薄，会更清楚地理解这一点。

全世界生物类型平行演替这一重大事实，可用自然选择学说解释。新物种由于对较老的类型占有优势的新变种兴起而形成；在本地区已占上风、比其他类型占有某种优势的类型，自然会产生最多的新变种，即初始物种。初始物种必须更大程度地成功，才能得到保存，得以生存。我们在占有优势的植物中可以找到关于这一问题的明证，即在原产地最普通的而且分散最广的植物，会产生最大数目的新变种。占有优势、变异着而且分布辽阔，并在某种范围内已经侵入到其他物种领域的物种，当然一定具有最好机会进一步拓展，在新地区产生新变种和物种。分散的过程，常常是很缓慢的，取决于气候和地理的变化，要取决于意外的偶然事件。但是，从长远的观点看，占有优势的类型一般会在拓展上成功。在分离的大陆上，陆栖生物的分散也许要比连接的海洋中的海栖生物来得缓慢些。可以预料，陆栖生物演替中的平行现象，其程度不如海栖生物那样严密，而我们看到的也确是如此。

优势物种从任何区域拓展开来，可能遭遇更多的优势物种，那么它们的胜利道路，乃至生存就会止步。我们并不精确了解新优势物种繁殖的全部有利条件是什么，但我想可以看到，一批个体给了有利变异出现的更好机会，且与许多现有类型的激烈竞争会非常有利，还有拓展到新领地的力量也有利。一定的隔离量在很长的间隔时间后重现，也许也是有利的，如前所述。世界上一个区域也许对于陆栖新优势物种的产生最为有利，另一个区域则对于海水新优势物种最为有利。假如两个大地区长期处于同等程度的有利环境，其中的生物遭遇时，战斗会旷日持久而惨烈。一个栖息地的某些物种和另一个栖息地的一些物种会胜利。但是，从长远看，优势最大的类型不管出自何方，倾向于全面胜利。胜利后会引起其他的劣势类型的灭绝。由于劣势类型一般通过遗传而结成亲缘群体，所以整群的物种会日渐消失，当然单一的成员能够在零星地区长久生存。

这样，在我看来，全世界同样生物类型的平行演替，就其广义来说，它们的同时演替，与新物种由于优势物种的广为拓展和变异而形成这一原理非常符合：这样产生的新物种本身有遗传优势，而且已经比亲种和其他物种具有某种优越性，并且将进一步拓展、变异产生新物种。被击败而让位给新的胜利者的类型，由于共同地遗传了某种劣性，一般都是亲缘的群；所以，当改进的新群分布于全世界时，老群就会从世上消失；而且各地类型的演替，在最初出现和最后消失方面都倾向于一致。

还有与这个问题相关的另一值得注意之点。我已经提出理由表示相信：大多数富含化石的巨大地质层，是在沉降期间沉积下来的；不具化石的空白极长的间隔，发生在海底的静止或者隆起时，同样也在沉积物的沉积速度不足以淹没和保存生物的遗骸时出现。在这长久的空白间隔时期，我想各地的生物都曾经历了相当量的变异和灭绝，而且从世界的其他地方进行了大量的迁徙。有理由相信，广大地面曾蒙受同一运动的影响，所以严格同时代的地质层，大概往往是在世界同一部分的广阔空间内堆积起来的；但我们决没有权利断定这是一成不变的情形，而且广大地面总是不变地要受同一运动的影响。当两个地质层在两处地方于几乎一样的、但并不完全一样的期间内沉积下来时，按照前节所讲的理由，这两种情形中应该看到生物类型中相同的一般演替；但是物种不会是完全一致的，因为对于变异、灭绝和迁徙，这一地方比那一地方会有稍微多点的时间。

我猜想欧洲是有这种情形的。普雷斯特维奇（Prestwich）先生关于英法两国始新世沉积物的可称赞的论文，曾在两国的连续诸层之间找出了严密的一般平行现象；但是把英法两国的某些阶段加以比较时，虽然他看出两地同属的物种数目非常一致，然而物种本身却有差异，除非假定有地峡把两个海分开，分别栖息着同时代的但不相同的动物群，否则从两国接近这一点来考虑，此差异实难解释。赖尔对某些第三纪后期的地质层也做过相似的观察。巴兰德也指出波希米亚和斯堪的纳维亚的连续的志留纪沉积物之间有着显著的一般平行现象；不过，他还是看出了那些物种之间有着惊人的差异量。如果这些地方的地质层不是在完全相同的时期内沉积下来的——某一地的地质层往往相当于另一地的空白间隔——而且，如果两地物种是在若干地质层的堆积期间和它们之间的长久间隔期间徐徐进行变化的；那么在这种情形下，两地方的若干地质层按照生物类型的一般演替，可以排列为同一顺序，因而会虚假地呈现出严格的平行现象；尽管如此，物种在两地方的外观相当的诸层中并不见得是完全相同的。




论灭绝物种之间的亲缘及其与现存类型的亲缘。——现在让我们考察一下灭绝物种与现存物种的相互亲缘。它们都可归入一个自然大系统；这一事实根据传承的原理即可得到解释。任何类型越古老，一般与现存类型之间的差异便越大。但是，巴克兰（Buckland）早就阐明，化石都可以分类在至今还生存的群里，或者分类在这些群之间。灭绝的生物类型可以有助于填满现存的属、科和目之间的巨大间隔，这一点毋庸置疑。如果我们单单关注现存物种或灭绝物种，则其系列的完整就远不如把两者合在一个系统中。至于脊椎动物，古生物学家欧文可以用精彩的插图填满很多页，显示灭绝动物介于现存群之间。居维叶曾把反刍类（Ruminants）和厚皮类（Pachyderms）排列为哺乳动物中最不相同的两个目；但是欧文发现了众多的化石环节，他不得不改变全部两个目的分类法，而把某些厚皮类与反刍类一齐放在同一个亚目中。例如，他根据细微级进取消了猪与骆驼之间明显的大差别。至于无脊椎动物，无比权威的巴兰德说，他每日都领悟到，虽然古生代的动物同属于现存的目、科、属里，但在这样古老的时代，各群并不像现在一样区别得那么清楚。

有些作者反对把任何灭绝物种或物种群看作是现存物种或物种群之间的中间物。如果这个术语是指灭绝类型在一切性状上都是直接介于两个现存类型之间的话，这种反对或许是正当的。但是在自然的分类里，我发觉许多化石物种的确处于现存物种中间，而且某些灭绝属处于现存属中间，甚至处于异科的属中间。最普通的情形似乎是（特别是差异很大的群，如鱼类和爬行类），假定它们今日是由十二个性状来区别的，则古代成员赖以区别的性状会较少，所以这两个群以前多少要比今日更为接近些。

常言道，类型越古老，其某些性状就越能把现在区别很大的群连接起来。这句话无疑只限于在地质时代中曾经发生巨大变化的那些群；可是要证明这种主张的正确性却是困难的，因为，甚至现存动物，如肺鱼，已发现常常与很不相同的群有亲缘关系。然而，如果我们把古代的爬行类和无尾两栖类、古代的鱼类、古代的头足类以及始新世的哺乳类，与各该纲的较近代成员加以比较时，必须承认这句话是有一定道理的。

让我们看一看这几种事实和推论与变异传承学说的符合程度。这个问题有些复杂，必须请读者回顾第四章的图解。设有数字字母代表属，它们那里分出来的虚线代表每一属的物种。这图解过于简单，列出来的属和物种太少，不过没关系。横线代表连续的地质层，最上横线以下的一切类型都看作已灭绝。三个现存属，a14，q14，p14形成一个小科；b14，f14是一个密切近似的科或亚科；o14，e14，m14是第三个科。这三个科和从亲类型A分出来的几条传承线上的许多灭绝属合起来成为一个目，都从古代原始共同祖先遗传了某些相同的东西。根据以前这个图解说明的性状不断分歧倾向的原理，任何类型越是近代，一般越与原始祖先不同。这样，我们对最古化石与现存类型之间差异最大这个规律便可了解。然而，我们决不可假定性状分歧是必然发生的偶然性；它完全取决于物种的后代由此能够在自然组成中攫取许多的、不同的地位。所以，物种很可能随着生活条件的稍微改变而继续略微改变，并且在极长的时期内还保持着同样的一般特性，如同我们见到的某些志留纪类型的情形。这种情形在图解中用f14来表示。

如前，所有从A传下来的众多类型，无论是灭绝的和现存的，形成一个目；这一个目由于灭绝和性状分歧的连续影响，便分为若干亚科和科，其中有些假定已在不同的时期内灭亡了，有些却一直存续到今天。

考察图解便可看出，假定埋藏在连续地质层中的许多灭绝类型如果是在这个系列的下方几个点上发现的，那么最上线的三个现存科的彼此差异就会小一些。例如，如果a1，a5，a10，f8，m3，m6，m9等属被发掘出来，那三个科就会十分密切地联结在一起，大概势必会连合成一个大科，这与反刍类和厚皮类的情形差不多一样。然而反对把灭绝属看作是联结起三个科现存属的中间物的人也有道理，因为它们成为中间物并不是直接的，却是通过许多大不相同的类型，经过漫长曲折的路程。如果许多灭绝类型是在中央的横线地质层之一——例如VI号线——之上发现的，而且线下什么也没有，那么只有左边两个科（a14等和b14等）势必合而为一；另外两个科（a14到f14现在包括五个属，还有o14到m14）还是会保持不同。然而，这两个科的相互差异要比化石发现以前来得小些。例如，设两个科的现存属彼此相差十二个性状，那么在VI横线那个时代生存的各属，相差的性状就要少一些；因为在传承的这样早期阶段，从本目共同祖先的性状分歧没有以后程度大。这样，古老而灭绝的属往往在性状上便好歹介于它们的变异后代之间，或介于旁系亲族之间。

在自然状况下，情况要比图解所示的复杂得多；群的数目更多，存续的时间极端不等，而且变异的程度也不相同。我们所掌握的不过是地质记录的最后一卷，而且残缺不全，除极少的情况下，我们没有权利指望把自然系统中的广大间隔填充起来，从而把不同的科目联结起来。我们所能期望的，只是那些在既知地质时期中曾经发生过巨大变异的群，应该在较古的地质层里彼此稍微接近些；所以较古的成员要比同群的现存成员在某些性状上的彼此差异来得小些；最优秀古生物学者们一致证明，情形常常是这样。

这样，根据变异传承学说，有关灭绝生物类型彼此之间，及其与现存类型之间的相互亲缘关系的主要事实似乎可得到圆满解释，而用其他任何观点是完全解释不通的。

根据同一学说，很明显，地球历史上任何一个大时期内的动物群，在一般性状上将承前启后。例如，生存在图解第六个大时期的物种，是生存在第五个时期的物种的变异后代，而且是第七个时期更加变异了的物种的祖先；因此，它们在性状上几乎不会不是介于上下生物类型之间的。然而，必须承认，某些以前的类型已经全部灭绝，而且任何地方都有新类型从外地移入，在连续地质层之间的长久空白间隔时期曾发生过大量变异。有鉴于此，每一个地质时代的动物群在性状上无疑是介于前后动物群之间的。这里只要举出一个事例就可以了。当泥盆系最初发现时，这个系的化石立刻被学者们认为在性状上是介于上层的石炭系和下层的志留系之间的。但是，各动物群并不一定完全介于中间，因为连续的地质层中有不等的间隔时间。

各时代的动物群从整体上看，在性状上是近乎承前启后的，某些属对于这一规律虽为例外，但不足以构成异议以动摇此说正确性。例如，福尔克纳博士曾把乳齿象和象按照两种分类法进行排列——先按照互相亲缘，再按照生存时代，结果两者并不符合。具有极端性状的物种不是最古老的或最近代的；具有中间性状的物种也不是属于中间时代的。但是在这种以及在其他类似的情形里，如果暂时假定物种的初次出现和消灭的记录是完全的，我们没有理由去相信连续产生的各种类型必定有对应的存续时间。一个极古的类型可能有时比外地后生的类型存续得更为长久，栖息在隔离区域内的陆栖生物尤其如此。以小喻大，如果把家鸽的主要现存族和灭绝族尽可能按照亲缘的系列加以排列，则这种排列不会与其产生的时间顺序密切一致，而且与其消灭的顺序更不一致：亲种岩鸽至今还生存着，而许多介于岩鸽和传书鸽之间的变种已经灭绝了；在喙长这一主要性状上站在极端的传书鸽，比站在这一系列相反一端的短嘴翻飞鸽发生更早。

来自中间地质层的生物遗骸在某种程度上具有中间的性状，与这种说法密切关联的有一个事实，是古生物学者都主张的，即两个连续地质层的化石彼此之间的关系，远比两个远隔的地质层更为密切。匹克推特举了一个熟知的事例：来自白垩层的几个阶段的生物遗骸一般是类似的，虽然各个阶段中的物种不同。仅仅这一事实，由于它的一般性，似乎已经动摇了匹克推特教授物种不变的信念。凡是熟知地球上现存物种分布的人，对于密切连续地质层中不同物种的密切类似性，不会企图用古代地域的物理条件保持近乎一样的说法去解释的。请记住，生物类型，至少是栖息海里的生物类型，曾经在全世界几乎同时发生变化，所以变化是在极其不同的气候和条件下进行的。试想更新世包含着整个冰期，气候的变化非常之大，请注意海栖生物的物种类型所受到的影响却是何等之小。

密切连续地质层中的化石遗骸虽然列为不同的物种，但密切相似，其全部意义根据生物传承学说是显而易见的。因为各地质层的累积往往中断，并且连续地质层之间存在着长久的空白间隔，如前章阐明，我们不该期望在任何一两个地质层中找到在这些时期开始和终了时出现的物种之间的一切中间变种；但是我们在间隔的时间（用年来计量是很长久的，用地质年代来计量则并不长久）之后，应该找到密切近似的类型，即某些作者所谓的代表种；而且我们确能找到。总之，正如我们有权利所期望的那样，我们已经找到证据来证明物种类型的缓慢的、难觉察的变异。




论古代生物类型的发展状态。——许多人在讨论，新近类型是否比古代更发达。我不想进入这个主题，因为学者们尚未有令对方满意的关于高级、低级类型的定义。但是，在一个意义上，我的理论认定新近的类型势必比古代的类型高级；每一个新物种都通过生活斗争中对先前的类型具有某种优势而形成。如果世界某地始新世的生物与同地或异地现存的生物在几乎相似的气候下进行竞争，始新世的动植物当然要败北消灭；正如第二纪的动物要被始新世的动物打败消灭，古生代的动物要被第二纪的动物所打败消灭一样。我不怀疑，相对于古代失败类型而言，这种提高过程明显可察觉地影响到了新近取胜的生命类型的体制，但我找不到测试这种进步的办法。例如，甲壳类在自己的纲里并不是最高级的，但能打败软体动物中最高级的。欧洲的生物近年来以非常之势扩张到新西兰，并且夺取了先前被占据的地方，据此我们认为，如果把大不列颠的所有动植物都放生到新西兰去，一大堆英国的生物类型会随着时间的推移在那里彻底归化，而且消灭许多土著的类型。另一方面，从新西兰现在发生的现象看，鉴于很少有一种南半球的生物曾在欧洲的任何部分变为野生的，如果把新西兰的一切生物放生到大不列颠去，我们很可怀疑是否会有大量的品种成功夺取现在被英国动植物占据着的地方。从这种观点来看，可以说大不列颠的生物要比新西兰的生物高级得多了。然而最熟练的博物学者，根据两地物种的调查，并不能预见到这种结果。

阿加西斯坚决主张，古代动物在某种程度上类似于同纲的新近动物的胚胎，也即灭绝类型在地质上的演替与新近类型的胚胎发育有一点平行。我必须听从匹克推特和赫胥黎的想法，认为这种观点对不对远未证明。但我满心希望日后能够证实，至少是关于从属群方面的，这些群在新近的时期内相互分枝了。阿加西斯的这个学说与自然选择论不谋而合。下面章节将试图说明成体和胚胎的差异是由于变异在一个不很早的时期发生，而在相应年龄得到遗传的缘故。这种过程听任胚胎几乎保持不变，同时使成体在连续的世代中继续不断地增加差异。

因此胚胎好像是自然界保留下来的一张图画，描绘着动物先前未大事变化过的状态。这种观点大概是正确的，然而也许永远得不到充分证明。例如，最古的已知哺乳类、爬行类和鱼类都严格地属于它们的本纲，虽然它们之中有些老类型彼此之间的差异比今日同群的典型成员彼此之间的差异稍少，但要想找寻具有脊椎动物共同胚胎特性的动物大概是徒劳的，除非志留纪地层的最下部以下深处发现岩床，但发现这种地层的机会是很少的。




第三纪末期同一地域内同样模式的演替。——许多年前，克利夫特（Clift）先生曾阐明，从澳洲洞穴内找到的化石哺乳动物与该洲的现存有袋类是密切近似的。南美洲拉普拉塔的若干地方发现的类似犰狳甲片的巨大甲片中，同样的关系也是显著的，外行人也可以看出。欧文教授曾以最动人的方式阐明，在拉普拉塔埋藏的大量化石哺乳动物，大多数与南美洲的模式有关系。伦德（MM．Lund）和克劳森（Clausen）在巴西洞穴里采集的丰富化石骨中，可以更明白地看到这种关系。这等事实给我的印象极深，便在1839年和1845年坚决主张这种“模式演替的法则”和“同一大陆上死亡者和生存者之间的奇妙关系”。欧文教授后来把这种概念扩展到欧洲大陆的哺乳动物上去。在这位作者复制的新西兰灭绝巨型鸟中，我们看到同样的法则。巴西洞穴的鸟类中也可看到同样的法则。伍德沃德教授曾阐明，同样的法则对于海栖贝类也是适用的，但是由于大多数软体动物分布广阔，所以并没有很好地表现出来。还可举出其他的例子，如马德拉的灭绝陆栖贝类与现存陆栖贝类之间的关系，以及咸海里海（Aralo-Caspian）的灭绝与现存碱水贝类之间的关系。

那么，同一地域内同一模式的演替这个重要法则意味着什么呢？如果有人把同纬度下澳洲和南美洲某些地方的现存气候加以比较之后，就企图以不同的物理条件来解释这两个大陆上生物的不同，而另一方面又以相同的条件来解释第三纪末期两个大陆上同一模式的一致，那么，他可算是大胆了。也不能断言有袋类主要或仅仅产于澳洲，贫齿类以及其他美洲模式的动物仅仅产于南美洲，是不变的法则。因为我们知道，古代欧洲曾有许多有袋类动物栖住过；我在上述出版物中曾阐明美洲陆栖哺乳类的分布法则，从前不同于现在。从前北美洲非常具有该大陆南半部分的特性；南半部分从前也比今天更为密切近似北半部分。同样，根据福尔克纳和考特利（Cautley）的发现，我们知道印度北部的哺乳动物，从前比今天更为密切近似非洲。关于海栖动物的分布，也可以举出类似的事实来。

按照变异传承学说，同一地域内同样模式持久地但并非不变地演替这一伟大法则，便立刻得到说明；因为世界各地的生物，在以后连续的时间内，显然都倾向于把密切近似而又有某种程度变异的后代遗留在该地。如果一个大陆上的生物从前曾与另一大陆差异很大，那么它们的变异后代仍然会按照近乎同样的方式和程度发生差异。但是经过了很长的间隔期间以后，同时经过了容许大量互相迁徙的巨大地理变化以后，较弱的类型会让位给占优势的类型，而生物过去和现在的分布法则就不会一成不变了。

有人会嘲笑着问，我是否曾假定大懒兽以及亲缘大怪物在南美洲遗留了树懒、犰狳和食蚁兽作为退化的后代？这是完全不能承认的。这种巨大动物全部灭绝了，没留下后代。但巴西的洞穴内有许多灭绝物种在大小和其他性状上与南美洲现存物种密切近似；这等化石中的某些物种也许是现存物种的真实祖先。千万不要忘记，按照我的理论，同属的一切物种都是某一物种的后代，所以，如果有各具八物种的六个属见于一个地质层中，而且有六个具有同样八物种的其他亲缘或代表的属见于后面连续的地层中，那么，我们可以断言，各个较老的属只有一个物种留下了变异后代，构成六个新属，各个老属的其他七个物种皆归灭亡，没有留下后代。还有更普通的情形，即六个老属中只有两三个属的两三个物种是六个新属的双亲：其他老物种和其他老属全归灭绝。在衰微的目里，如南美洲的贫齿类，属和物种的数目都在减少，所以只有更少的属和物种能留下变异的嫡系后代。




前章和本章提要。——我曾试图阐明，地质记录是极端不完全的；地球只有一小部分做过细密地质学调查，只有某些纲的生物在化石状态下大都保存下来；博物馆里保存的标本和物种的数目，即使与区区一个地质层中所经历的世代数相比也完全等于零。由于沉陷对富含化石而且厚到足以经受未来陵削作用的沉积物的累积是必要的，连续地质层之间必有长久的间隔期间；在沉陷时代大概有更多的灭绝生物，在上升时代大概有更多的变异而且记录也保存得最不完全；各个单一的地质层不是连续沉积起来的；各个地质层的持续时间与物种类型的平均寿命比较起来，大概要短些；任何一个地域、地质层中，迁徙对于新类型的初次出现，是有重要作用的；分布广的物种是变异最频繁的、最常产生新种的物种；变种最初往往是地方性的。如果把所有这些原因结合起来看，必定会搞得地质记录极不完整，而且可大致说明为什么我们没有发现中间变种以极微细级进的步骤把一切灭绝和现存的生物类型联结起来。

凡是不接受关于地质记录性质的本观点的人，当然拒绝我的全部理论。他会徒劳地发问，以前想必把同一个大地质层内若干阶段中发现的密切近似物种或代表物种连接起来的无数过渡环节在哪里呢？他会不相信连续地质层之间一定要经过悠久的间隔期间；他会在单独考察任何一个大区域如欧洲的地质层时，忽略了迁徙起着何等重要的作用；他会极力主张整个物种群分明是（往往是假象）突然出现的。他会问，必有不计其数的生物生活在志留系第一个岩床沉积起来以前很久，但遗骸在哪里呢？我仅能根据以下的假设来回答这最后的问题，即今日海洋所延伸的地方，海洋已经存在了极长久的期间，而上下升降着的大陆在其今日存在之处，自志留纪开始以来就已经存在了；而远在志留纪以前，这个世界呈现了完全不同的景象；由更古地质层形成的古大陆，今日仅以变质状态的遗物存在，或者还埋藏在海洋之下。

撇下这些难点，我看古生物学其他的主要重大事实便与通过自然选择的生物变异传承学说相符了。我们就可以理解，新物种为什么缓慢而连续地产生；为什么不同纲的物种不一定一起发生变化，以同等速度、同等程度发生变化，然而长远看一切生物毕竟都发生了某种程度的变异。老类型的灭绝差不多是新类型产生的必然结果。我们能够理解为什么一个物种一旦消灭就永不再现。物种群在数目上的增加是缓慢的，存续时期也各不相等；变异的过程必然是缓慢的，取决于许多复杂的偶然事件。属于优势大群的优势物种倾向于留下许多变异后代，由此形成新的亚群和群。新群形成之后，低活力群的物种，由于从共同祖先那里遗传到劣根性，倾向于一起灭绝，不在地面上留下变异后代。但是物种全群的彻底灭绝往往是极缓慢的过程，因为有少数后代会在被保护的孤立场所残存下来。群一旦完全灭绝，就不再出现；世代的连锁环节已经断了。

我们能够理解为什么变异最频繁的优势类型，长远看倾向于以亲缘的变异后代分布于世界，一般都能够成功取代生存斗争中的劣势群。因此，经过长久的间隔期间之后，世界上的生物便呈现曾经同时发生变化的样子了。

我们能够理解，为什么古今一切生物类型汇合起来成为一个大系统，它们统统世代相连。我们能够理解，由于性状分歧的连续倾向，为什么类型越古，一般与现存类型差异越大；为什么古代的灭绝类型常倾向于把现存物种之间的空隙填补起来，往往把先前被分作两个不同的群合而为一；但更普通的是只把它们稍微拉近一些。类型越古，在某种程度上越常常呈现在不同的群之间的中间性状；因为类型越古，与广为分歧之后的群的共同祖先越接近，从而越相似。灭绝类型很少直接介于现存类型之间，而仅是通过许多不同的类型采取漫长而迂回曲折的路径。我们能清楚看到，为什么密切连续的地质层的生物遗骸比遥远地质层亲缘更密切，因为被世代更密切地联结在一起之故。我们能清楚看到，为什么中间地质层的生物遗骸具有中间性状。

世界历史上各个连续时代内的生物，在生活竞赛中战胜了祖先，等级上相应地提高了，这可以说明很多古生物学者模糊不清的观点——体制整体上进步了。灭绝的古代动物在某种程度上都与同纲中近代动物的胚胎相类似，如果今后能证明这一点，事实便会豁然开朗。晚近地质时代中同一结构模式在同一地域内的演替就不再神秘了，根据传承原理，可以干净利落地加以解释。

这样，如果地质记录如我相信的那样不完全，至少可以断定这记录不能被证明更加完全，那么对于自然选择学说的主要异议就会大事化小小事化了。另一方面，我认为，古生物学的所有主要法则明白地宣告了，物种是由普通的生殖产生出来的：老类型被改进了的新生物类型所淘汰，那是我们周围仍然起作用的变异法则所致，并且由“自然选择”保存了下来。





第十一章　地理分布


今日的分布不能用物理条件的差别来解释——障碍物的重要性——同一大陆上生物的亲缘——创造的中心——由于气候的变化、土地高低的变化及偶然途径的散布方法——冰期中的散布，与世界的分布一样广

考察地球表面的生物分布时，我们注意的第一件大事便是，各地生物的相似或不相似都不能全部用气候等物理条件来解释。近来，几乎每一个研究这个问题的作者都得出了这种结论。仅仅美洲的情形差不多就足以证明这种结论的正确性了；因为，如果排除北极地区几乎是连续的陆地，所有作者都赞同新旧世界之间的区分是地理分布的最基本分界之一；然而，如果在美洲的广袤大陆上旅行，从美国的中部到最南端，将会遇到极多样的物理条件：潮湿不堪的地区、干燥的沙漠、巍巍的高山、草原、森林、沼泽地、湖泊和大河，各种温度都有。旧世界几乎没有一种气候或外界条件不能与新世界相平行——至少接近同一物种的一般需要，因为一群生物局限在具有稍微特殊条件的小区域里的现象，还很少见。例如，旧世界里有些小块地方比新世界的任何地方更热，但这里的动植物群并不奇特啊。尽管旧世界和新世界的条件具有这种平行现象，它们的生物却是何等不同呵！

在南半球，如果我们把南纬二十五度到三十五度之间的澳洲、南非洲和南美洲西部的广袤陆地加以比较，将会看出一些地方在一切条件上都是极端相似的，然而不可能指出更加决然不同的三种动植物群了。我们再把南美洲的南纬三十五度以南、二十五度以北的生物加以比较，因而气候条件相当不同；然而两者的相互关系，比它们和气候相近的澳洲、非洲的生物之间的关系，更加无比地密切。关于海栖生物也可举出类似的事实。

在一般观察里，我们注意的第二件大事是，阻碍自由迁徙的任何种类的障碍物，都与各地区生物的差异有密切而重要的关系。我们从新旧两世界几乎所有陆栖生物的重大差异中，可以看到这一点，不过北部地方是个例外，那里的陆地几乎连接，气候差异也微小，北温带地方的类型大概可以自由迁徙的，就像严格的北极生物目前所进行的那样。我们在同纬度下的澳洲、非洲和南美洲生物之间的重大差异中，也可看到同样的事实：因为这些地方的相互隔离几乎登峰造极。在各个大陆上，我们也看到同样的事实；巍峨而连续的山脉、大沙漠，甚至大河的两边，可以看到不同的生物；虽然，由于山脉、沙漠等等并不像隔离大陆的海洋那样无法逾越，也不像海洋持续得那样长久，所以同一大陆上生物的差异比起不同大陆程度要低得多。

关于海洋，我们可以看到同样的法则。没有比中、南美洲东西海岸的海栖动物差别更大了，没有一种鱼类、贝类、蟹类是相同的；但两个大动物群仅仅为巴拿马地峡所分割，狭小但无法逾越。美洲海岸的西方展开了广阔无边的海洋，没有迁徙者可以停脚的岛屿；在这里看到另一种障碍物，一越过这里，我们就在太平洋东部诸岛那里遇到别种完全不同的动物群。所以三种海栖动物群在相同的气候下，形成彼此相距不远的平行线，而分布到遥远的北方和南方；但是，由于被不可逾越的陆地或大海这样障碍物所隔开，是完全不同的。另一方面，从太平洋热带地方的东部诸岛再向西行，就不再遇到不可逾越的障碍物，那里有可以作为停脚处所的无数岛屿，经过半个地球的旅程后，便到达非洲海岸；在这广阔的空间，我们不会遇到断然不同的海栖动物群。虽然在上述美洲东部、美洲西部和太平洋东部诸岛的三种相近动物群中，没有一个贝类、蟹类、鱼类是共同的，但是还有许多鱼类从太平洋分布到印度洋，而且在几乎完全相反的子午线上的太平洋东部诸岛和非洲东部海岸，还有许多共同的贝类。

第三件大事，一部分已包括在上述的叙述里，是同一大陆、海洋里的生物都具有亲缘关系，虽然物种本身在不同地点和场所是不相同的。这是一个具有最广泛普遍性的法则，每一个大陆都有了无数的事例。然而学者旅行时，譬如说从北到南，总是惊异于亲缘密切而物种不同的连续生物群逐次更替，会听到密切近似而种类不同的鸟唱着近似的调子，会看到它们的巢构造相似却不同，卵的颜色几乎同样。麦哲伦海峡附近的平原上，栖息着美洲鸵鸟（Rhea）的一个物种，而在以北的拉普拉塔平原栖息着同属的另一物种；但没有像同纬度上非洲和澳洲那样的真正鸵鸟或鸸鹋（emu）。在同一拉普拉塔平原上可看到刺鼠（agouti）和绒鼠（bizcacha），和欧洲野兔和家兔的习性大同小异，而且都属于啮齿类的同一个目，但是构造上显然呈现美洲的模式。登上巍峨的科迪勒拉峰，可看到绒鼠的一个高山种；注视河流，看不到海狸（beaver）或麝香鼠（musk-rat），但可看到海狸鼠（coypu）和水豚（capybara），都是南美洲模式的啮齿类。不胜枚举啊。如果我们观察一下美洲海岸的岛屿，不管地质构造多么不同，但其生物本质上都是美洲模式，哪怕全是特殊的物种。如同前章所说的，我们可以回顾一下过去的时代，会看到美洲模式的生物当时在美洲大陆上和海洋里都是占优势的。在这等事实里我们看到某种深入的有机联系透过时空、遍及水陆的同一地域且与物理条件无关。学者如果不想深究这种联系是什么，一定是缺乏好奇心。

按照我的理论，这种联系就是传承，据我们确切知道的来说，单单这个原因就会使生物彼此十分相像，或者如在变种里所看到那样，使它们彼此近乎相像。不同地区生物的不相像，可以归因于通过自然选择的变异，其次大概要归因于不同的物理条件的直接影响。不相像的程度，取决于占优势的生物类型在或短或长的遥远时期内，从一处到另一处地方的迁徙多少受到了有效的阻碍；——取决于先前移来的生物的性质和数量，——取决于生活斗争中生物之间的相互作用反作用；——如我前面常提起的，生物和生物的联系是重中之重的关系。这样，障碍物由于制约迁徙，便发挥出高度的重要性，正如时间对于通过自然选择的缓慢变异过程所发挥的作用一样。分布广、个体多而且已经在它们广布的家乡里战胜了许多竞争者的物种，当扩张到新地方的时候，有取得新地位的最佳机会。在新家乡，它们会遇到新条件，而且会常常进一步变异和改进，这样，就得到进一步的胜利，并且产生成群的变异后代。依据这种变异传承原理，我们就能理解为什么属的一部分，全属，甚至一科会如此普遍和显著地局限在一个地方。

如前章所述，我不相信有必然发展的法则存在。各物种的变异性都有其独立性质，并且只有在复杂的生活斗争中有利于个体的时候，才能被自然选择所利用，所以不同物种的变异量不是整齐划一的。如果有若干物种经过直接的互相竞争后，集体地移进一个新的后来成为孤立的地方时，就很少发生变异；因为移动和孤立本身并不起任何作用。只有使生物相互间发生新的关系，并且以较小的程度与周围的物理条件发生新的联系时，这些原则才起作用。如前章所述，有些生物类型从极遥远的地质时代起就保持了差不多相同的性状，所以某些物种曾在广大的空间内迁徙，但未发生大变异。

按照这种观点，同属的若干物种虽然栖息在世界上相距极远的地方，但因都是从同一个祖先传下来的，原先一定是在同一个原产地发生的。至于那些在整个地质时期里很少变化的物种，不难相信都是从同一地移来的；因为自古以来，在地理上和气候上的巨变期间，几乎任何大量的迁徙都是可能的。但是在许多其他情形里，有理由相信同一属的诸物种是在比较近代的时期内产生的，对这方面的解说就极难。同样显然地，同种的个体虽然现今栖息在相距很远而孤立的地方，但一定来自双亲最初产生的地点，因为，前章已经说明，从不同物种的双亲通过自然选择产生一模一样的个体是不可信的。

我们现在看学者们宽泛讨论过的问题，即物种系在地球表面上一处，还是在多处创造出来的呢。至于同一物种如何从一处地方迁徙到今日所看到的那样相距很远而孤立的若干地方，无疑是极难理解的。然而，每一物种最初产生在一处地方的这种简单观点使人神往，排斥这种观点的人，也就排斥了普通的发生以及其后迁徙的真实原因，并且会把神迹的作用招引进来。普遍承认在大多数情形下，一个物种的栖息地总是连续的；如果一种动物栖息在相距很远的两处地方，或者具有迁徙时不易通过的中间地带的两处地方时，那么这种事情就被认为是值得注意的例外。迁徙时跨越大海的能力，显然仅限于陆栖哺乳动物，非任何其他生物所能及，因此同一哺乳动物栖息在相距很远的地方并不难解。大不列颠具有和欧洲其他大陆相同的四足兽类，没有一个地质学者觉得有什么难解，因为两地一度是相连的。但是，如果同一物种能在隔开的两地产生，那么为什么看不见一种欧洲和澳洲或南美洲共有的哺乳动物呢？生活条件是近乎相同的，所以许多欧洲的动植物已在美洲和澳洲归化了；而且在南北半球的这等相距很远的地方也有若干完全相同的土著植物。我认为，回答是某些植物由于有各种散布方法，曾经移徙过了广阔而断开的中间地带，但哺乳动物无法迁徙。各种障碍物对于分布有重大而显著的影响，只有大多数的物种产生在障碍物的一边，而不能迁徙到另一边的这种观点，才能解释。少数科，许多亚科，很多属，更多数目的属的分部，只局限在单一地方；若干学者曾经观察到，最自然的属，即其物种的相互联系最密切的那些属，一般都局限在同一地。我们更下去一步，即下到同种的个体，如果有正相反的法则，物种并不局限于一地，而产生于两个以上地方，这将是何等奇怪的反常啊！

于是，就像许多其他学者一样，我认为各个物种仅在一地产生，以后在过去和现在的条件下按其迁徙和生存力量所允许，再从该地迁徙出去，这种观点可能最有道理。无疑在许多情况下，无法解释同一物种怎么能从一地移到另一地，但是在最近地质时代肯定发生过地理气候变化，想必会打破许多物种从前的连续分布，弄得不连续了。所以我们不得不考虑到，分布连续性的例外是否够多，是否性质严重，致使我们放弃从一般考察看来是可能的那一观点——各个物种都是在一个地区内产生，并且尽可能远地从那里迁徙出去。如把现在生活在相距很远的隔离地点的同一物种的所有例外情况都加以讨论，实在是不胜厌烦，我也从来不妄言能给许多事例提出任何解释。但是，几句引言以后，我要对少数最显著的事实提出讨论；即，相距很远的山顶上以及北极、南极相距很远的地点生存同一物种；其次，淡水生物的广阔分布（见下章）；第三，同一陆栖物种出现在数百英里大海隔开的岛屿及其大陆上。同一物种生存在地球表面上相距很远而孤立的地点，这件事如果能在许多事例中根据各个物种从一个单一的产地迁徙去的这种观点加以解释，那么，考虑到我们对于从前气候地理的变化以及各种一时的输送方法一无所知，我看单一产地是普遍法则的观点，是无比稳妥的。

讨论这个问题，就能够同时考察对于我们同等重要的一件事，即同属若干物种（依我的理论必然都是从一个共同祖先传下来）是否从祖先栖息的地区进行迁徙，而且在迁徙的某段时间发生变异。栖息一地的大多数物种与另一地的物种密切近似或者同属，如果可以表明一地大概在以往的某一时代接受过另一地的生物，是几乎不变的事实，那我的理论就更加巩固了；因为依据变异原理，可以清楚地理解，为什么一地的生物与另一地相关，相互往来。例如，距离大陆几百英里之处隆起，形成的火山岛，随着时间的推移，大概会从大陆接受少数的生物，而它们的后代虽已变异，但因遗传仍会和大陆的生物明显有关系。这种性质的个案是普遍的，并且如以后还要进一步看到的，用独立创造的理论无解。一地的物种和另一地有联系的这种观点，与华莱斯先生最近雄文所主张的大同小异（用变种一词代替物种），他断言，“各物种的产生，和以前存在的密切近似的物种在空间时间上都是一致的”。通过通信，我现在已明白，他把这种一致归因于伴随着变异的传承。

前面“创造的中心单一还是多个”的话题，和另一个近似的问题并没有直接关系——即同种的所有个体是否从一对配偶传下来的，是否从一个雌雄同体个体传下来的，或者如某些作者所设想的那样，是从许多同时创造出来的个体传下来的。关于从不杂交的生物（如果存在），依我看，各个物种一定是从连续改进的变种传下来的，变种曾经互相淘汰，但决不和其他个体或变种相混合；所以，在变异改进的每一连续阶段，同一变体的一切个体都是从单一亲体传下来的。但在大多数情形下，即每次生育时习惯上须行交配和经常进行杂交的一切生物，我认为同种的个体在缓慢的变异过程中，会因互相杂交而差不多保持一致；许多个体会同时进行变化，并且在每一阶段上变异的全量不会是只从单一亲体传下来的。举一个实例来说明我的意思：英国的赛马和每一个其他马品种都略不相同，但是它们的异点和优越性并不是单从任何一对亲体传下来的，而是归功于每一世代中对于许多个体继续进行了仔细的选择和训练。

我在上面选出了三类事实，作为“创造的单一中心”学说的最大困难问题，在讨论它们之前，必须稍微说一说散布的方法。




散布的方法。——赖尔爵士等作者已经精干地讨论了这个问题。我在这里只能举出重要事实的最简单的摘要。气候变化对于迁徙一定有过强有力的影响。一地在从前气候不同的时候，大概曾经是迁徙的大路，今日却不能通过，下面对于这方面的问题不得不细论。陆地水平的变化一定也曾有过重要的影响：狭窄的地峡现在把两种海栖动物群隔开；如果地峡在水中沉没，或者曾经沉没过，两种动物群就会混合在一起，或者从前混合过了。今日的海洋所在之处，在以前的时代或有陆地把岛屿，甚至可能诸大陆连接在一起，陆栖生物就可以从这地跑到别地去。陆地水平的巨大变化，曾经发生在现今生物的存在期间，没有地质学者争论过这一点。福布斯主张，大西洋的一切岛屿，在最近的过去一定曾与欧洲或非洲相连，并且欧洲也与美洲相连。其他的作者们就这样假想各海洋都有过陆路可通，而且几乎把每一个岛屿与某大陆连接在一起。如果福布斯的论点果然可信的话，那么必须承认，几乎没有一个岛屿在最近的过去是不和大陆相连的。这一观点便可快刀斩乱麻似的解决同一物种分布到相距极远的地点的问题，而且消除了许多难点；但据我所能判断，我们无权承认现今物种存在的期间有过这样巨大的地理变化。在我看来，关于陆地水平的巨大变动固然有丰富的证据，但是并没有证据证明其位置和范围有过重大的变化，以致在近代彼此相连，且和各个中间海岛相连。我直率承认，先前有过许多岛屿现在沉海了，而从前可能作为动植物迁徙时的歇脚地点。在产生珊瑚的海里就有这种沉下的岛屿，现今上面有珊瑚环，即环礁（atolls）做标志。总有一天会承认各个物种曾是从单一的产地产生的，充分承认这一点，并且随着时间的推移，在我们知道了关于分布方法的确实情形时，就能稳妥地推测从前陆地的范围了。但我不相信将来能够证明今日天各一方的许多大陆在近代曾连续地，或者差不多连续地连在一起，并且和许多现存的海岛连在一起。若干关于分布的事实，——例如在几乎每个大陆两边，海栖动物群存在巨大差异，——若干陆地甚至海洋的第三纪生物和该处现存生物有密切关系——哺乳动物和海洋深度有某种关系（以后还要讲到）——依我看这类事实都和近代曾发生过极大的地理变化的说法正相反，而这种变化对于福布斯所提出并被其追随者所承认的观点必不可少。依我看，海岛生物的性质及其相对的比例，也与海岛从前曾与大陆相连这一观点正相反。况且岛屿几乎普遍都有火山的成分，这也不能支持都是大陆沉没后残遗物的说法；——如果原来作为大陆的山脉而存在的话，那么，至少有些岛会像其他山峰那样是由花岗岩、变质片岩、古代化石岩等岩石所构成，而不单是由火山物质叠积而成。

现在我必须对所谓意外的分布法说几句话，其实叫偶然的分布法更为适当些。这里单说植物。植物学著作常常说这种或那种植物不适于广泛传播；但是，关于跨海输送难易可以说几乎一无所知。伯克利先生帮助我做几种试验前，甚至连种子对海水损害作用有多大的抵抗力也不知道。我惊奇地发现，87种种子中有64种浸泡28日后还能出芽，并且有少数浸泡137日后还能成活。为了便利，我主要试验了没有蒴或果肉的小种子；这些种子几天之后都沉下去了，所以无论是否会受海水的损害，都不能漂浮过广阔的海面。后来我试验了一些较大的果实和蒴等等，其中有些能漂浮很长时间。众所周知，新鲜木材和干燥木材的浮力大不同；而且我发现洪水往往把植物或枝条冲下来，在海岸上晒干，然后溪水泛滥再把它们带入海里。于是，我把94种植物带有成熟果实的茎和枝加以干燥，然后放到海水里去。大多数很快沉下去了，但是有些在新鲜时只能漂浮短时间，干燥后却能漂浮很长的时间。例如，成熟的榛子即刻便会沉下，但干燥后却能漂浮90日，而且种子以后还能发芽；带有成熟浆果的石刁柏（asparagus）能漂浮23日，干燥后却能漂浮85日，而且种子以后还能发芽；苦爹莱（Helosciadium）的成熟种子两日便沉下，干燥后大约能漂浮90日，而且以后还会发芽。总计起来，这94种干植物中，有18种能漂浮28日以上，其中有些还能漂浮更久。这就是说，八十九分之六十四的种子浸水28日后还能发芽；并且九十四分之十八带有成熟果实的植物（与上述试验的物种并不完全相同）干燥后能漂浮28日；所以，如果从这些贫乏的事实能够做出任何推论的话，我们便可断言，任何地方百分之十四种植物种子大概能漂流28日，而且还会保持发芽力。约翰斯顿（Johnston）的“地文图”上表明，若干大西洋流的平均流速一昼夜为33英里（有些海流速一昼夜为60英里）；按照这种平均速度，一地可能有百分之十四种植物的种子漂过924英里的海面而达到另一地，而且搁浅之后如果有向陆风将其吹到适宜的地点，大概还会发芽。

我试验以后，马滕斯（M．Martens）也进行了相似试验，不过方法更好，把种子放盒子里，漂浮在海上，所以种子有时浸湿有时暴露在空气中，就像真的漂浮植物一般。他试验了98个种子，大多数和我的不同，但是所选用的是许多大果实和海边植物的种子，可以延长平均漂浮时间并加强对海水损害作用的抵抗力。另一方面，他没有事先使带有果实的植物或枝条干燥；如我们说过的，干燥可使某些植物漂浮得长久些。结果是，九十八分之十八种植物的种子漂浮了42日，而且以后还能发芽。但是我并不怀疑暴露在波浪中的植物，比起我们的试验中不受剧烈波动影响的植物，漂浮时间要短些。所以，大概可以更稳妥地假定，一个植物区系的百分之十种植物的种子，干燥之后大概可以漂过900英里宽的海面，而且还能发芽。大果实常比小果实漂浮得更长久，这是有趣的，因为具有大种子、大果实的植物很难由其他任何方法来输送；德康多尔阐明，这种植物在分布范围上一般是有限的。

种子有时候可由另一种方法来输送。漂流木常被冲到很多岛上，甚至位于最广阔的大洋中央的岛上去；太平洋珊瑚岛上的土人专从漂流木的根间搜求做工具用的石子，这种石子竟作为贵重的税品。我细观后发现形状不规则的石子嵌在树根中间时，间隙里和石子后面常常藏着小块泥土——完全严密地包藏在里边，极长久的运输期间也不会有一点冲洗出去；一株约50年生橡树的根间，有一小块泥土严密地藏在那里，小泥土上有三株双子叶植物发芽了：我肯定这个观察是准确的。我还可以指出，鸟的尸体漂浮在海上，有时不致即刻葬身鱼腹，这种漂流鸟的嗉囊里有许多种类的种子，很久还保持活力，例如豌豆和大巢菜浸在海水里只要几天便死去；但是在人造海水中漂浮过30日的鸽子的嗉囊内，种子几乎全能发芽，这使我惊奇。

活鸟运输种子，不失为高度有效的媒体。我能够举出许多事实来表明，许多种类的鸟常常被大风吹过很远的海面。我看可以稳妥地假定，在这种情形下，飞行时速常常是35英里；有些作者做过更高的估计。我从未见过养分丰富的种子能通过鸟肠的事例；但是坚果种子甚至能通过火鸡的消化器官而不损坏。在两个月的期间，我在花园里从小鸟的粪便里检出了12种种子，看上去都是完好的，试验了一些，还能发芽。但是下述的事实更加重要：鸟的嗉囊并不分泌胃液，而且根据我的试验，一点也不会损害种子的发芽力；鸟看到大批的食物饱餐后，可以肯定地断言，谷粒在12，甚至18小时内，不会全部进入沙囊里。鸟在这一段时间里会轻易被风吹到500英里以外，而且我们知道，鹰是找寻疲态鸟的，被撕裂的嗉囊含有物很容易就此散布出去。布伦特先生告诉我，他朋友曾经不得不放弃信鸽从法国到英国的放飞，因为英国海岸有鹰将刚到的信鸽大批杀死。有些鹰和猫头鹰把捕获物囫囵吞下，经过12到20小时的时间，吐出的食物团块中，我根据动物园所做的试验知道，还有能发芽的种子。有些燕麦、小麦、粟、加那利草（canary）、大麻、三叶草和甜菜的种子，在不同食肉鸟的胃里经过12到21小时之后还能发芽；两粒甜菜的种子经过二日又十四小时后，还能生长。我发现淡水鱼类吃多种陆、水生植物的种子，鱼常常被鸟吃掉，这样，种子就可能从一地输送到另一地。我曾把许多种类的种子塞进死鱼的胃里，随后拿给鱼鹰、鹳和鹈鹕去吃，隔了许多小时之后，鸟把种子集在小团块里吐出来了，或者跟着粪便排出去；排出的种子中若干还保持了发芽力。然而，有些种子经过这种过程之后总是死掉的。

鸟喙和鸟爪一般是清洁的，但我可以证明有时候也沾有泥土：有一次我曾从一只鹧鸪的脚上取出22英厘干黏土，泥土中有一块大巢菜种子大小的小石子。所以有时候种子能输送很远，有大量事实证明，泥土几乎都带有种子的。想想每年几百万鹌鹑飞过地中海，我们还能怀疑附着在鸟爪上的泥土有时候含有几颗小种子吗？这个问题下文再讨论。

我们知道冰山有时负载着土石，甚至挟带着树枝、骨头和陆栖鸟巢，所以不必怀疑，如赖尔所提出的，有时想必在北极区和南极区把种子从一地输送到另一地；而且在冰期，从现在的温带的一地把种子输送到另一地。相对于靠近大陆的大西洋其他岛屿上的物种来比较，亚速尔群岛有大量的植物物种和欧洲共通，相对于纬度，植物多少带有北方的性状（如沃森先生所说），我由此推测，这些岛屿上的部分种子是在冰期由冰带去的。我曾请求赖尔爵士写信给哈通（Hartung）先生，问他那些岛上是否见过漂石，他回答，看到过花岗岩和其他岩石的巨大碎块，而这些岩石不是该群岛原来就有的。因此我们可以稳妥地推论，冰山曾把拖来的岩石卸在这海中群岛的岸上，岩石至少有可能带来了少数北方植物的种子。

考虑到这几种输送方法，以及今后无疑有待发现的其他输送方法，几多万年以来，年复一年地起着作用，我想，许多植物如果没有这样被广泛输送出去，简直是奇哉怪也。这种输送方法有时被称为意外的，但这说法不完全正确；海流不是意外的，盛行风的风向也不是意外的。这里应当注意，任何输送方法很少能把种子运到很远的距离，种子如受海水作用太久，就不能再保持活力，也不能在鸟类的嗉囊或肠子里长久携带。然而，这种方法却足以通过几百英里宽的海面，或者从这岛到那岛、从大陆到邻近的岛进行偶然的输送，但不能从一个相距很远的大陆输送到另一个大陆。相距很远的大陆上植物区系不会因这种方法而大事混淆起来，而仍然像今日看到的一样，保持着区分。海流由于走向，不会把种子从北美洲带到不列颠，但大概会而且实际把种子从西印度带到我国的西海岸，在那里，哪怕没有因长久的海水浸泡而死去，也不会忍耐我国的气候的。差不多每年总有一两只陆鸟被风吹过整个大西洋，从北美洲来到爱尔兰和英格兰的西海岸；但是这稀有的漂泊者只有一种方法可以输送种子，即附着在鸟爪的泥土里，而这本身却是罕见的意外。甚至在这种情形下，一粒种子落在适宜的土壤上而达到成熟，其机会是何等之少啊！但是，因为像大不列颠那样生物繁多的岛，根据现在所能知道的，在最近的几世纪内没有通过偶然的输送方法从欧洲或者任何其他大陆接纳过迁徙者（很难证明这一点），就主张生物贫乏的岛，离大陆更远，便不会用相似的方法接纳迁徙者，那就大错特错了。如果有二十种种子或动物输入一个岛，纵使其生物远不如不列颠那样繁多，能很好适应新家乡而归化的，无疑不会多于一个种类。但在悠久的地质时期内，当那个岛正在隆起并且没有繁多的生物栖息以前，对于偶然的输送方法的效果，我看并不能做出有效的反对议论。在一个几乎不毛的岛上，只有少数或者没有破坏性的昆虫或鸟类生存在那里，差不多每一粒偶然来到的种子，如果气候适宜，都会发芽成活的。




冰期中的散布。——在数百英里低地隔开的山顶上有许多相同的动植物，而高山种不能在低地成活，这是既知的关于同一物种生活在相距很远的地点而彼此间显然没有可能从一地迁徙到另一地的最显著事例之一。在阿尔卑斯或比利牛斯的积雪区和欧洲极北部分，有何等多的同种植物存在，这的确是值得注意的事实；但美国怀特山（White Mountains）上的植物和加拿大拉布拉多（Labrador）的植物完全相同，阿萨·格雷说，它们和欧洲最高山上的植物也几乎完全相同，这是更值得注意的。早在1747年，这样的事实就使葛美伦（Gmelin）断言同一物种一定是在若干不同的地点独立创造的；要不是阿加西斯等人唤起了对于冰期的注意，我们也许要停留在这种观点里的。冰期，如以后就要讲到的，可对此做简单的解释。几乎有各种各样的有机无机的证据来证明，在很近的地质时期内，欧洲中部和北美都是处于北极的气候之下的。苏格兰和威尔士的山岳用山腰的划痕、表面的磨光和翘起的漂石，表明那里的山谷以前曾经充满了冰川，这比火灾劫后的房屋废墟更清楚地说明以往的情形。欧洲气候的变化如此之大，以致意大利北部古代冰川所留下的巨大冰碛上，现在已经长满了葡萄和玉米。美国的大部分地方所看到的漂石和有冰川近岸冰划痕的岩石，明白地显示出从前那里有寒冰时期。

从前冰期气候对于欧洲生物分布的影响，如福布斯所清楚解释的，大致如下。但如果假定新冰期是慢慢而来的，随后就像从前的情形那样又慢慢过去，会更易追踪这变化。当寒冷到来，各南方地带适于北极生物，不适合以前的温带生物，后者遭淘汰，北方生物乘虚而入。同时温带生物南移，否则会被障碍所阻挡而死亡。山上雪冰遮盖，从前的高山生物降到平地来。寒冷达到极点时，清一色的北极动植物群会布满欧洲中部各地，向南直达阿尔卑斯和比利牛斯，甚至可以伸延到西班牙。现在美国的温带地区同样也布满北极动植物，而且和欧洲的动植物大致相同；因为我们假定曾向南方各地迁徙的现在北极圈的生物，在全世界都是显著一致的。我们可以假定北美的冰期来得比欧洲略早或略晚，所以朝南迁徙也略早或略晚，但对于最后的结果无关宏旨。

回暖，北极生物北退，后面紧紧跟着的是温带地区生物。当山脚下冰雪消融，北极生物遂占据融解清空的地方，温暖渐渐增加，渐渐向上迁移，这时候一部分兄弟则启程北去。因此，充分回暖时，曾经共同生活在欧洲和北美洲低地的同种生物，又再次见于新旧世界的寒冷地区，孤立于相距很远的山顶上了，低地上的北极生物则全部灭绝。

这样，我们就能理解在远隔万里的各地，如北美和欧洲的高山，为什么许多植物是相同的。这样，我们还能理解为什么各个山脉的高山植物与其正北方或近乎正北方的北极类型更是特别有关系：寒冷到来时的第一次迁徙以及温暖回还时的再迁徙，一般是向着正南和正北的。例如，苏格兰的高山植物，如沃森先生所说的，以及比利牛斯的高山植物，如雷蒙德（Ramond）所说的，和斯堪的纳维亚北部的植物特别相似；美国的和拉布拉多相似；西伯利亚山上的和俄国北极区相似。这观点是以从前确有冰期为根据的，所以在我看来，它能极其满意地解释欧洲和美洲的高山植物以及北极植物现在的分布状况。因此，当我们在其他地区发现同一物种生活在相距很远的山顶上，纵使没有其他证据，几乎也可以断定，寒冷的气候曾经允许它们通过中间低地进行迁徙，而现在中间低地已变得太暖和，不适于生存了。

如果冰期以来的气候比现在略温暖（某些美国地质学家认为这样，主要根据条鳍鱼纲化石［Gnathodon］的分布），那么北极生物和温带生物会在晚近时期进一步向北方略进，然后后退到目前栖息位置；但我没有看到满意的证据，证明冰期以来有这种稍暖时期插入。

北极类型随着气候的变化，起初向南，后来再退北，长途迁徙时，遇到的气候不相上下；必须特别注意，是集体迁徙，所以相互关系不会受到很大的扰乱。因此，按照本书反复强调的原理，它们将不会发生很大的变异。但高山生物在温暖回还的时候就被隔离了，起初在山脚下，最终在山顶上，其情形就有些不同了；因为所有相同的北极物种都留在彼此相距很远的山脉中，而且能在那里生存是不可能的事情；它们还很可能和古代高山物种相混合，这些古代高山物种在冰期开始前想必已经生长在山上，并且在最冷的时期一定会暂时被驱逐到平地上来，还会受到多少不同气候的影响。它们的相互关系在某种程度上会因此受扰乱，结果容易发生变异；而且我们发现事实确是如此；如果我们拿欧洲几大山脉上现在的高山动植物来互相比较，虽然许多物种还是相同的，有些却成为变种，有些成为可疑的类型，更有少数成为代表各个山脉的密切近似但不相同的物种了。

在上述例证里，我描述了冰期的想象情景，假定冰期开始时，环绕北极地方的北极生物就像今日那样一致。但是上述关于生物分布的议论，不仅仅适用于严格的北极类型，而且适用于许多亚北极和某些北温带的类型，因为其中某些类型在今日北美洲和欧洲的平原以及低坡上是相同的；可以合理质问：我怎样解释冰期开始时全世界的亚北极和北温带类型必要的一致程度。目前，新旧世界的亚极带以及北温带的生物被整个大西洋和北太平洋隔开了。冰期中，新旧世界的生物居住在比现在更南的位置，想必更加完全地被更广阔的海洋隔开了。我认为，只要考察更早时期相反性质的气候变化，就可以克服上述的难点。我们有可靠的理由相信，在新上新世时期，冰期之前，世界上大多数生物在种别上和今日是相同的，并且当时的气候要比今日暖和。因此，我们可以假定，今日生活在纬度六十度气候之下的生物，在上新世却生活在纬度六十六度至六十七度之间北极圈下的更北方；而严格的北极生物当时则生活在更接近北极的中断陆地上。现在看一看地球仪，就可知道在北极圈下，有差不多连续的陆地从西欧通过西伯利亚一直连到美洲东部。这种环极陆地的连续性，使生物在较适宜的气候下可以自由迁徙，于是新旧世界的亚北极生物和北温带生物在冰期以前的必要一致性，便可得到解释。

根据上述各种理由，可以相信我们的大陆虽然经过地面水平的巨大局部变动，但长久保持了几乎相同的相对位置，我极愿意扩大上述观点，并做出推论，即在更早和最热的时期，例如旧上新世的时期，大量同样的动植物都栖息在几乎连续的环极陆地上；而且，无论新旧世界的动植物，在冰期没有开始之前很久，随着气候的逐渐变冷，开始慢慢南移。我认为，欧洲中部和美国看到的它们的后代大多数已发生了变化。根据这种观点，我们就能理解为什么北美洲和欧洲的生物之间的关系很少是相同的，——如果考虑到两个大陆的距离以及它们被整个大西洋所隔开，就可以知道这是一个高度值得注意的关系。我们还能进一步理解某些观察者所提出的一件奇异事实：第三纪末期欧洲和美洲的生物之间的相互关系比起今日更为密切；因为在这温暖的时期，新旧世界的北部差不多被陆地连接在一起，可以作为桥梁供两处生物迁徙，后来由于寒冷，桥梁就不通了。

上新世慢慢降温的期间，栖息在新旧世界的共同物种一向北极圈以南迁徙，相互之间就要完全隔绝。就温带生物来说，在很久的时期以前就发生了这种隔离。当动植物向南迁移，就会在一处大地区与美洲土著生物相混合，而且势必发生竞争；在另一处大地区则和旧世界的生物发生竞争。于是，各种事情都有利于发生大量变异——远比高山植物发生的变异为大，因为后者仅在极其近代的期间内被隔离在两个世界的若干山脉和北极陆地上。因此，比较新旧世界温带地区的现存生物时，我们只找到很少数相同的物种（虽然阿萨·格雷最近指出两地植物相同的情况比从前料想的为多），但我们在每一个大纲里可以找到许多类型，某些学者列为地理族，另外一些学者则列为不同的物种；还有大量密切近似的或代表的类型被所有学者列为不同的物种。

陆地上如此，海水里也是这样，海栖动物群在上新世，甚至在更早的期间沿着北极圈的连续岸边几乎一致地缓慢向南迁徙，根据变异的学说，便可解释今日完全隔离的海洋里生活的类型何以密切近似。这样，我想便能理解北美洲温带东西两岸有许多至今仍然生存的第三纪代表类型；还有更值得注意的个案，即许多密切近似甲壳类（如代那的大作所描述的）、栖息在地中海和日本海的某些鱼类以及其他海栖动物——地中海和日本海今日已被整个的大陆和半个地球的赤道海洋的所隔开了。

现在栖息在分隔海中，以及北美洲和欧洲的温带陆地的过去和现在不同物种之间的密切关系，用创造学说是无解的。我们不能说，该地的物理条件相似，因而创造的物种也是相似的；因为，比方我们把南美洲的某些部分和南非洲或澳洲加以比较，便知道这些地方的一切物理条件都是密切相似的，但其生物却完全不相似。

我们必须回到更直接的冰期主题。我相信福布斯的观点大可扩展。在欧洲，从不列颠西海岸到乌拉尔山脉，并且南到比利牛斯山，我们看到冰期最明显的证据。根据冰冻的哺乳动物和山岳植被的性质，可以推论西伯利亚也曾受过相似影响。沿着喜马拉雅山，在距离900英里的各地，冰川留下了从前下泻的痕迹；胡克博士在锡金看到过玉蜀黍生长在古代的巨大冰碛上。赤道以南，我们拥有新西兰有过冰川作用的直接证据；该岛上距离很远的山上发现有同样的植物，也说明了同样的情况。如果发表的单例可信，那么我们便拥有了澳洲东南角有冰川活动的直接证据。

再看美洲；北美大陆的东侧，南至北纬三十六度至三十七度处，曾发现冰川带来的岩石碎片，在气候已经大变的太平洋沿岸，南至北纬46度的地方也有，落基山脉也看到过漂石。在近赤道的南美科迪勒拉山，冰川一度远远扩张到今日的高度以下。我在智利的中部吃惊地看到一个巨大岩屑堆结构，高度800英尺左右，横跨安第斯山脉的山谷，我现在确信这是巨大的冰碛，遗迹比任何现有冰川都低得多。这个大陆两边的更南方，从南纬四十一度到最南端，有巨大漂石是从遥远的原产地运来的，这里有从前冰川活动的最明显证据。

我们不知道冰期在世界反面的这几个遥远地点是严格同时的，但我们在几乎每一个个案中都有充分证据，冰期属于最后的地质年代之内。我们还有很好的证据，在每个地点，用年度量，冰期持续了很久的时间。在不同地点，冰期出现、结束有早有晚，但考虑到在每个地点冰期持续很久，而且按照地质学的意义来说都是属于近代的，依我看，冰期至少在部分时期，全世界实际上是同时的。没有明确的相反证据，我们至少可以承认，北美的东西两面，在赤道和暖和的温带科迪勒拉山，以及美洲最南端的两面，冰川作用是同时的。如果承认这一点，不可避免地要认为，全世界的温度，在冰期曾经同时降低。但是，如果沿着某些经线宽条带同时降低温度，就足够满足我的目的了。

根据整个世界从北极到南极同时降温的这个观点，至少是经线宽条带同时降温，就可以大大有助于说明相同和亲缘物种的现今分布情况。在南美洲，胡克博士曾阐明，火地岛的显花植物（在该地贫乏的植物群中构成了不小的部分）有四五十种和欧洲植物相同，而且存在许多密切近似的物种，尽管两地相距遥远。在赤道下的美洲高山上，生有大群属于欧洲属的特殊物种。在巴西的最高山上，加德纳（Gardner）看到几个欧洲的属，它们却不生长于中间广袤的热带地方。在加拉加斯（Caraccas）的西拉（Silla），著名的洪堡很久以前就发现了属于科迪勒拉山的特有属的物种。在非洲阿比西尼亚的山上，有若干欧洲的类型以及好望角的特有植物群的少数代表。在好望角，有极少数的欧洲物种可以相信不是人为引进的，并且山上有不见于非洲热带地方的若干欧洲代表类型。在喜马拉雅山，印度半岛与外界隔离的山脉上，锡兰的高地上，以及爪哇的火山顶上，生长有完全相同或彼此代表，并且同时代表欧洲，但不见于中间炎热低地的许多植物。爪哇的高峰上所采集的各属植物目录，竟是欧洲小丘上采集物的百草图！还有更动人的事实，生在婆罗洲山顶上的某些植物竟明确代表南澳洲类型。某些澳洲类型，我听胡克博士说，沿着马六甲半岛高地扩张出去，一面稀疏地散布在印度，一面向北去，直达日本。

澳洲南方的山上，米勒博士曾发现过若干欧洲的物种；不是人为引进的其他物种则生长在低地；胡克博士告诉我，见于澳洲但不见于中间炎热地方的欧洲植物属可以列成一个长目录。胡克博士的力作《新西兰植物区系概论》里，关于该大岛的某些植物也举出了类似和动人的事实。因此，我们知道某些生长在世界各地热带的较高的高山上的植物，以及生长在南北温带平原上的植物，有时候一模一样，但大部分不是同一物种，却显而易见相互有亲缘。

这简单的叙述只适用于植物；但在陆栖动物分布方面，也可举出一些严格类似的事实。海栖动物中也有同样的情形；我愿援引最高权威代拿教授的一段叙述为例：“新西兰和大不列颠处在地球上的对趾点，但是两地甲壳类的密切相似，超过其他任何部分，这的确妙不可言。”理查森爵士也说，在新西兰，塔斯马尼亚（Tasmania）等海岸，有北方的鱼重现。胡克博士告诉我说，新西兰和欧洲有二十五个藻类的物种是共通的，但它们不见于中间的热带海中。

应该注意，南半球的南部、热带区域的山脉上发现的北方物种和类型，不属于北极，而属于北温带。沃森先生最近说：“高山植物系从北极向赤道退却时，其实变得越来越不属于北极了。”许多生长在温暖区域山上以及南半球的类型，其价值是可疑的，被某些学者列为不同物种，而被另一些学者列为变种；但有一些肯定与北方类型相同，而许多与北方类型密切相关的，则必须列为物种。

下面看看若接受大批地质学证据支持的观点会得到什么启发，让我们同意，在冰期整个世界，或者世界大部分，比现在同时寒冷得多。冰期，如用年代来计算，必然是极长久的；我们如果记得某些归化的动植物在数百年内曾经分布到何等广大的空间，那么，这一时期对于任何数量的迁徙将是绰绰有余的。当寒冷渐渐增强，所有热带动植物从两边退向赤道，后面跟着温带生物，再后面是北极生物，但后者我们现在不考虑。热带植物可能大量灭绝，数量说不清。也许以前的热带所支持的物种与现在所见拥挤在好望角和澳洲温带部分地方的一样多。我们知道，许多热带动植物可以承受相当程度的寒冷，在降温温和的时候逃过灭绝厄运，特别是躲藏到最热的地点。但必须记住的要点是，所有热带生物都或多或少受到灾祸。另一方面，温带生物迁入赤道地带，尽管会处于比较新的环境，受灾却不大。可以肯定，许多温带植物如果受庇护免遭竞争者的侵入，都可以承受比原产地炎热得多的气候。因此，依我看，考虑到热带生物处于受灾状态，无法与入侵者抗衡，一定数量的生机勃勃的主流温带类型有可能渗透土著队伍，达到甚至跨越赤道。当然，入侵遇到高地，也许是干燥气候，则一切顺利。福尔克纳博士告诉我，对于亚热带气候过来的多年生植物，最具破坏性的是热带的高温加上潮湿。另一方面，最最潮湿高温的地区会庇护热带土著生物。西北走向的喜马拉雅山脉，长条的科迪勒拉山，似乎提供了两条大的入侵路线。最近胡克博士告诉我一个惊人事实，火地岛和欧洲共有的所有显花植物总计46种，在北美依然存在，这想必处于生物挺进路线上。但我不怀疑，某些温带生物在冰期鼎盛时进入乃至跨越了热带低地，北极类型从原产地迁徙大约二十五纬度，覆盖了比利牛斯山脚的土地。在这个酷寒时期，我认为，海平面上的赤道地带气候大概和现在的六七千英尺高处的感觉差不多相同。在这最冷的时期，我想赤道区域的大片低地一定覆盖着混生的热带植被和温带植被，就像胡克所描述的现在繁生在喜马拉雅山低坡上的植物一样。

我认为，冰期有大量的植物，若干陆生动物和一些海生生物从南北温带迁徙入热带地区，一些甚至跨越了赤道。回暖时，这些温带类型自然要爬升到高山上去，在低地上则灭绝了；没有抵达赤道的类型，要朝北或者朝南回迁，回到老家；但主要是北方的类型，跨越赤道后继续前进，远离故乡，来到南半球的温带纬度。尽管根据地质证据有理由认为，北极贝类在长途南迁北归中整体上很少变异，但对于赤道地带上山定居还有进入南半球的入侵类型来说，情况可能截然不同吧。它们受到陌生生物围困，不得不与许多新生物进行竞争，也许其构造、习性、体质的有选择变异会使它们获益。所以，这些漂泊者中，有不少在新家成为特征显著的变种或者不同的物种，尽管它们仍然因遗传因素与北半球或者南半球的兄弟们明显相关。

关于美洲，胡克坚决主张，关于澳洲，德康多尔坚决主张，相同的植物、相关类型从北向南的迁徙，多于从南向北的迁徙，这是值得注意的事实。然而，我们在婆罗洲和阿比西尼亚的山上还看到少量南方的植物类型。我猜想这种偏重于从北向南的迁徙，是由于北方陆地范围大，且北方类型在故乡生存的数量多，结果，通过自然选择和竞争，便较南方类型达到完善阶段高，即占有优势的力量。这样，在冰期两群生物相混合时，北方类型就有力量，能够战胜不强的南方类型。今日还有这种情形，我们看到很多的欧洲生物布满拉普拉塔，并且小程度地占据澳洲，一定程度上打败了那里的土著生物；然而，近两三世纪从拉普拉塔，近三四十年从澳洲，虽然有容易附着种子的兽皮、羊毛等媒介物大批输入，但是在欧洲任何地方归化的南方类型却为数极少。热带高山上想必出现过同样的事情：冰期前无疑充满了特有的高山类型，但是这些几乎到处都屈服于北方的较大地区和高效生物车间中产生出来的占优势类型了。在许多岛屿上，土著生物和外来的归化生物差不多数目相等，甚至已属少数；哪怕没有被消灭，数目也大幅减少，而这是灭绝的第一步。山是陆地上的岛；冰期前赤道地区的高山想必是彻底孤立的。我认为，这些陆地岛屿上的生物已屈服于北方大地域内产生出来的生物，就像真正的岛上生物最近到处屈服于由人力而归化的大陆生物一样。

今日生活在南北温带、热带山脉上的近似物种的亲缘及其分布的所有难点，我远非设想都可用上述观点来消除。许多难点悬而未决。我并不声称要指出迁徙的精确路线和方式，为什么某些物种迁徙了，而其他物种没有迁徙；为什么某些物种变异且产生了新类型群，而其他物种却依然保持不变。除非我们能说明，为什么某一物种能够借人力在异乡归化，而其他物种不能如此；为什么某一物种比另一物种在家乡分布得远两三倍，多两三倍，否则就不能指望解释上述事实。

我说过有各种难点留待解决：例如，胡克博士在讨论北极区的植物学著作中清清楚楚地阐明了其中一些最引人注目的难点，在此无法赘述。我只能说一说，在凯尔盖朗岛（Kerguelen Land）、新西兰和富其亚（Fuegia）这样辽远的地点，生长着同样的物种；我认为，冰期快结束时，按照赖尔的意见，冰山大概对于它们的散布有关系。在南半球的这等地方以及其他远隔地方生存若干不同的物种，但完全属于南方的属，根据我的变异传承理论，这是一个更值得注意的难点。有些物种非常不同，我们不能设想，自从冰期开始以来，有足够的时间可供它们迁徙，然后进行必要程度的变异。这种事实似乎指明了同属的不同物种是从一个共同的中心点向四面八方迁徙的；并且我以为南半球和北半球一样，在冰期开始以前，曾有较温暖的时期，那时候，现在覆盖着冰的南极地方，支持了一个高度特殊而孤立的植物群。可以设想，在冰期消灭这个植物群之前，少数类型由于偶然的输送方法以及由于现今已沉没了的岛屿作为歇脚点的帮助，也许发生在冰期开始前，就已经在南半球的各处地方广阔地散布开了。这样，我认为，美洲、澳洲、新西兰的南岸，大概会稍微沾染上这种植物的特殊类型。

赖尔爵士在一篇雄文里，用和我几乎一样的说法来推论全世界气候大转变对于地理分布的影响。我认为，世界最近感觉到了一个大变化周期，根据这个观点，外加通过自然选择进行变异的观点，可以解释相同或亲缘生物类型分布在地球各处的许多事实。生命之水在一个短暂时期，可以说从北向南流，也从南向北流，在赤道交叉了。但是水流自北向南流者，其力量较大，结果它就能自由地在南方泛滥。正如潮水沿着水平线把漂流物留下，但在潮水最高的岸边上升更高，所以生命之水流沿着从北极低地到赤道高地这一条徐徐上升的线把漂流的生物留在我们的山顶上。这样搁浅留下来的生物可以和人类的未开化种族相比拟，被驱逐到并且生存在差不多各处的山间险要之处，这些地方就有我们感兴趣的一种记录，表明周围低地的既往居住者。





第十二章　地理分布（续）


淡水生物的分布——论海洋岛上的生物——两栖类和陆栖哺乳类不存在——岛屿生物与最近大陆上生物的关系——从最近原产地移来的生物及其以后的变化——前章和本章的提要

湖泊和河流系统被陆地障碍物所隔开，可想而知，淡水生物在同一地区里不会分布很广，又因海是更加难以克服的障碍物，所以不会扩张到遥远的地区。但是情形恰恰相反。不但属于不同纲的许多淡水物种有广大的分布，而且亲缘物种也令人瞩目地遍布于世界。第一次在巴西淡水中采集生物时，我记得十分清楚，对于那里的淡水昆虫、贝类等与不列颠很相似而周围陆栖生物与不列颠很不相似，我感到非常惊奇。

但是，关于淡水生物广为分布的能力，尽管出乎意料，我想在大多数情形里可以做这样的解释：它们以一种对自己极有用的方式变得适合于在本乡本土里从一池塘到另一池塘，从一河流到另一河流经常进行短途迁徙；从这种能力发展为广远散布是近乎必然的结果。这里只能考虑少数几个例子。关于鱼类，我想同一个淡水物种绝没有在两个相距遥远的大陆上存在。但在同一大陆上，物种常常分布很广，而且变化莫测；因为在两个河流系统里物种有同有异。少数事实似乎有利于淡水鱼类由于意外方法而偶然地被输送出去的可能性。例如，活鱼被旋风卷起落在印度，并不是很稀有的事，鱼卵离开水以后保持生活力。但我倾向于将淡水鱼的散布主要归因于在最近时期里陆地水平的变化而使河流相互流通。还有，河流相互流通的事也发生在洪水期，这里没有陆地水平的变化。我们有莱茵河黄土地的证据，在新近地质时期内出现过陆地水平的大变，地面上曾经栖居着现有陆栖淡水贝类。连续的山脉自古以来就是分水岭，彻底防止了河流系统合并，两侧鱼类大不相同，也导致了相同的结论。至于亲缘淡水鱼出现在世界上相隔遥远的地点，无疑有许多个案现在无法解释：但有些淡水鱼属于很古的类型，在这等情形下，巨大的地理变化就有充分的时间，因而也有充分的时间和方法进行大量的迁徙。再者，咸水鱼类被给予小心处理，就能慢慢地习惯于淡水生活；按照法伦西奈（Valenciennes）的意见，几乎没有一类鱼族群只在淡水里生活，所以可以想象，属于淡水群的海栖物种可以沿着海岸游得很远，并且变异适应远地的淡水。

淡水贝类的某些物种分布很广，并且亲缘物种也遍布全世界，根据我们的学说，从共同祖先传下的近似物种，一定是来自单一源头。它们的分布情况起初使我大惑不解，它们的卵不像是能由鸟类输送的；并且卵与成体一样，都会立刻被海水杀死。我甚而不能理解某些归化的物种怎么能够在同一地区里很快地分散。但是我所观察的两个事实——无疑其他事实还有待观察——对于这一问题有一定的启发。当鸭子从盖满浮萍（duckweed）的池塘突然冒出时，我曾两次看到这些小植物附着在鸭背上；并且发生过这样的事情：把一些浮萍从一个水族培养器移到另一个时，我曾无意中把一个水族培养器里的贝类移入到另一个。不过还有一种媒介物或者更有效力：我把鸭爪挂在一个水族培养器里，其中有许多淡水贝类的卵正在孵化，鸭爪代表睡在天然池塘中的鸟爪；我找到许多极端细小的、刚刚孵化的贝类爬在它的脚上，并且极牢固地附着在那里，脚离开水时并不脱落，但再长大一些就会自己落下。这些刚刚孵出的软体动物虽然本性上是水栖的，但在鸭爪上，在潮湿的空气中，能活到12至20小时；在这样一段时间里，鸭或苍鹭（heron）至少可以飞行六七百英里；如果被风吹过海面到达海岛或其他遥远的地点，必然会降落在池塘或小河里。赖尔爵士告诉我，曾捉到一只龙虱（Dytiscus），有盾螺（Ancylus，一种像帽贝［limpet］的淡水贝）牢固地附着在上面；并且同科的水甲虫细纹龙虱（Colymbetes），有一次飞到贝格尔号船上，当时此船距离最近的陆地是四十五英里：没有人能说清它可以被顺风吹到多远。

关于植物，早就知道很多淡水甚至沼泽物种分布得非常之远，在大陆上、最遥远的海洋岛上，都是如此。德康多尔说过，含有极少数水栖成员的陆栖植物的大群显著表现了这一点；似乎由于水栖，便立刻获得了广大的分布范围。我想，这一点可以由有利的散布方法加以说明。我以前说过，少量泥土偶然会附着在鸟脚和喙上。涉禽类徘徊池塘淤泥边缘受惊飞起时，脚上极可能带着泥土。可以表明，这一目的鸟漫游极广；有时来到最遥远的不毛海岛上，不大会降落在海面，脚上泥土不致洗掉；到达陆地之后，必然会飞到天然的淡水栖息地。我不相信植物学者能体会到塘泥里含有何等多的种子；我做过几个小试验，这里只能举出最惊人的例子：我在二月里从小池塘边的水下三个不同地点取出三调羹污泥，干燥以后只有六又四分之三盎司重；我把它盖起来，在书房里放了六个月，当每一植株长出来时，把它拔出并加以计算；这些植物属于很多种类，共计有537株；而那块黏软的淤泥早餐杯就可以盛下！考虑到这一点，我想，水鸟不把淡水植物的种子输送到遥远地点，这些植物的分布范围不广，倒是不能解释的事情了。这同样的媒介对于某些小型淡水动物的卵大概也会有作用。

其他未知的媒介大概也发生过作用。我曾经说过，淡水鱼类吃某些种类的种子，但吞下许多别种的种子后再吐出来；甚至小的鱼也会吞下中等大的种子，如黄睡莲和眼子菜属（Potamogeton）的种子。苍鹭和别的鸟，一个世纪又一个世纪地天天在吃鱼；吃鱼后便飞起，并走到别的水中，或者被风吹过海面；我们知道，许多小时以后吐出、随粪便排出的种子，还保持着发芽的能力。以前看到那精致的莲花（Nelumbium）的大型种子，又记得德康多尔关于这种植物分布的意见时，我想它的分布方法一定是不能理解的；但是奥杜旁说，他在苍鹭的胃里找到过南方莲（按照胡克博士的意见，大概是大型北美黄莲花［Nelumbium luteum］）的种子。尽管我没有事实证明，但类推的方法使我相信，这种鸟飞到远方的池塘，然后饱吃一顿鱼，会把含有未消化的种子从胃里吐出，或者在给小鸟喂食时掉下，就像大家知道的，有时候将小鱼掉下。

考察这几种分布方法时，应该记住，池塘、河流在例如隆起的小岛上最初形成时，其中是没有生物的；于是单个的种子或卵会获得良好的成活机会。同一池塘的生物之间，不管个体怎么少，总有生存斗争，不过物种数目与陆地相比总是少的，水栖物种的竞争比起陆栖物种就不大剧烈；结果外来的水生生物侵入者在取得新的位置上比陆上的移居者有较好的机会。我们还应记住，许多淡水生物在自然系统上是低级的，有理由相信，这样的生物比高等生物变异慢些；这就使相同水栖物种的迁徙有了较长的时间。我们不应忘记，许多淡水类型从前大概连续分布在广大面积上，然后在中间地点灭绝了。但是淡水植物和低等动物，不论是否保持同一类型或好歹变异了，我想其广泛分布显然主要依靠动物，特别是飞翔力强的且自然地从这一片水飞到另一片遥远的水的淡水鸟类会把种子和卵广泛散布开去。大自然就像细心的园丁，将种子从某性质的花坛取出，丢到同样适合生长的另一个花坛里去。




论海洋岛上的生物。——同一物种和亲缘物种的一切个体都是由一个祖先传承而来，因而全部是自共同的诞生地迁徙出来的，尽管随着时间推移渐渐栖息于天涯海角。根据这一观点，我曾选出有关分布的最大困难的三类事实，现在对其中最后一类加以讨论。我已经说过不能苟同福布斯关于大陆扩张的观点，它如果加以合法光大，就会推论出以下论点：在最近的期间内，所有现存岛屿都曾几乎连接于某个大陆。这个观点可消除许多难点，但我想也无法解释关于岛屿隔绝生物的所有事实。下面，我将不限于讨论散布的问题，同时也要讨论与独立创造学说和变异传承学说之对错有关的某些其他事实。

栖息在海洋岛上的各物种在数量上与同样大小的大陆面积相比是稀少的：德康多尔在植物方面，沃拉斯顿在昆虫方面，都承认了这个事实。看看幅员辽阔、有多种多样生境的南北达780英里的新西兰，一共也不过有750种显花植物；如果把这与繁生在澳洲或好望角同等面积上的物种相比较，我想我们必须承认有某种与不同物理条件无关的原因造成了物种数的如此悬殊差异。甚至条件一致的剑桥郡还具有847种植物，盎格尔西小岛具有764种，但是有若干蕨类植物和引进植物也包括在这些数目里，而且从其他方面讲，这个比较也不十分恰当。有证据证明，阿森松这个不毛岛屿只有不到六种原产地显花植物；可是现在有许多物种已在那里归化了，就像新西兰和每一其他可以举出的海洋岛的情形一样。在圣赫勒拿，有理由相信归化的动植物几乎消灭了许多本地的生物。谁承认每一物种单独创造的学说，就必须承认有足够大量数目的最适应的动植物并不是为海洋岛创造的；因为人类曾经无意地到处引进，使那些岛充满了生物，在这方面远比自然做得更加充分，更加完善。

虽然海洋岛物种数稀少，但是特有种类（即世界其他地方找不到的种类）的比例往往是极大的。例如，如果把马德拉岛特有陆栖贝类，或加拉帕戈斯群岛特有鸟类的数目与任何大陆加以比较，然后把岛屿的面积与大陆加以比较，会看到这是千真万确的。这种事实在我的理论上是可以料想到的，因为，上文说明，物种经过长久的间隔期间以后偶然到达新的隔离地区，势必与新的同住者进行竞争，极容易发生变异，并常常产生成群的变异后代。可是决不能因为一个岛上某一纲物种几乎是特有的，就认为其他纲或同纲其他部分的物种也必然是特有的；这种不同似乎取决于没有变化的物种曾经轻易地集体性移入，所以彼此的相互关系没有受到多大扰乱。例如，加拉帕戈斯群岛上几乎所有陆栖鸟是特有的，而在11种海鸟里只有两种是特有的；显然，海鸟比陆栖鸟更易到达这些岛上。另一方面，百慕大和北美洲的距离，几乎同加拉帕戈斯群岛和南美洲的距离一样，而且百慕大有一种很特殊的土壤，却并没有一种特有的陆栖鸟；从琼斯（J．M．Jones）先生有关百慕大的报告中知道，有很多北美洲的鸟类在年年大迁徙中定期或者偶然来到这个岛上。马德拉岛没有一种特有鸟类，哈考特（E．V．Harcourt）先生告诉我，几乎年年都有很多欧洲和非洲的鸟类被风吹到马德拉。所以，百慕大和马德拉诸岛充满了鸟类，长久以来在那里进行斗争，并且变得相互适应了。因此，定居新家乡以后，每一种类将被其他种类维持在适宜地点上和习性中，结果就不容易发生变化。再者，马德拉栖息着数量惊人的特有陆栖贝类，但没有一种海栖贝类是仅限于这里的海岸的：虽然不知道海栖贝类是怎么散布的，可是能知道它们的卵或幼虫，附着在海藻或漂浮木或涉禽类的脚上，就能输送过三四百英里的海洋，要比陆栖贝类容易得多。栖息在马德拉的不同目的昆虫表现了差不多平行的情形。

海洋岛有时缺少某些纲的动物，其位置显然被其他生物所占据；这样，爬行类在加拉帕戈斯群岛，巨大的无翼鸟在新西兰便代替了哺乳类。讲到加拉帕戈斯群岛的植物，胡克博士阐明，不同目的比例数与其他地方很不相同。这种个案一般都是用岛上物理条件来解释的，但是这种解释很值得怀疑。我认为，移入的便利与否似乎与条件的性质有同等的重要性。

关于遥远岛屿的生物，还有许多可注意的小事情。例如，在没有哺乳动物栖息的某些岛上，有些本地特有植物具有美妙的带钩种子；可是，钩的用途在于让种子适合四足兽的毛或毛皮带走，没有比这种关系更加明显的了。这个个案依我看就不是难点，带钩的种子大概可以由其他方法带到岛上去；于是，那种植物经过轻微变异，就成为本地的特有物种了，它仍然保持它的钩，痕迹器官成为一种无用的附属物，就像许多岛上的甲虫，在愈合的翅鞘下仍有枯缩的翅。再者，岛上经常生有乔木或灌木，它们所属的目在其他地方只包括草本物种；而依照德康多尔所阐明的，乔木不管原因怎样，一般分布的范围是有限的。因此，乔木极少可能到达遥远的海洋岛；而草本植物本来没有机会与充分发育的乔木竞争获胜，一旦定居在岛上，只有草本植物来竞争，就会由于生长得越来越高，高出其他植物，迅速占有优势。在这种情形下，不管草本植物属于哪一目，自然选择就有增加其高度的倾向，这样先变成灌木，然后变成乔木。

关于海洋岛上没有整目的动物，圣樊尚（Bory St．Vincent）很久以前就说过，大洋上点缀着许多岛屿，但从未发现两栖类（蛙、蟾蜍、蝾螈）。我曾煞费苦心地证实这种说法，并且发现它千真万确。但是我确信，新西兰大岛的高山上有蛙。但我怀疑这个例外（如果信息属实）可以用冰川作用来解释。那么多的海洋岛一般都没有蛙、蟾蜍和蝾螈，是不能用海洋岛的物理条件来解释的；其实，岛屿似乎特别适于这类动物：因为蛙已经被带进马德拉、亚速尔和毛里求斯，大量繁生，以致成为可厌之物。由于大家知道这类动物及其卵遇到海水就立刻死亡，依我看很难输送过海，可知为什么不存在于海洋岛上。但是，它们为什么不在那里被创造出来，按照特创论就很难解释了。

哺乳类提供了另一相似个案。我仔细地搜索了最古老的航海记录，还没有结束搜索，并没有找到过一个确定无疑的事例可以证明陆栖哺乳类（土人饲养的家畜除外）栖息在离开大陆或大的陆岛300英里以外的岛屿上；在许多离开大陆更近的岛屿上也同样找不到。福克兰群岛有一种似狼的狐狸，极像是例外；但是这群岛屿不能看作海洋岛，位于与大陆相连的沙洲上；而且冰山曾把漂石带到它的西海岸，也可能把狐狸带过去，如今这在北极地区是常有的事。可是我们不能说小岛养不活小的哺乳类，因为在世界上许多地方它们生活在靠近大陆的小岛上；几乎不能举出一个岛，小型四足兽不能在那里归化并大事繁生。按照特创论的一般观点，不能说那里没有足够的时间来创造哺乳类；许多火山岛是十分古老的，从遭受过的巨大陵蚀作用以及第三纪的地层可以看出：那里还有时间来产生本地所特有的、属于其他纲的物种；我们知道，哺乳动物的新物种在大陆上比其他低于它们的动物以较快的速率产生和消灭。虽然陆栖哺乳类不见于海洋岛，空中哺乳类却几乎每一岛上都有。新西兰有两种世界其他地方找不到的蝙蝠：诺福克岛、维提群岛（Viti）、小笠原群岛、加罗林和马利亚纳群岛、毛里求斯，都有特产蝙蝠。试问，为什么那假定的创造力在遥远的岛上产生出蝙蝠而不产生其他哺乳类呢？根据我的观点，这个问题容易解答；因为没有陆栖动物能够渡过海洋的广阔空间，但蝙蝠却能飞过去。人们曾经看到蝙蝠在白天远远地在大西洋上空飞翔；并且有两种北美蝙蝠或经常或偶然地飞到离大陆600英里的百慕大。我从专门研究这一科动物的汤姆斯（Tomes）先生那里听到，许多同类物种具有广大的分布范围，并且可以在大陆上和遥远的岛上找到。因此，只要设想这类漫游的物种在新家乡由于新位置而发生自然选择变异就可以了，并且由此就能理解，为什么海洋岛虽有本地的特有蝙蝠，却没有一切陆栖哺乳类。

除了海岛与大陆的遥远度与陆栖哺乳类的关系外，还有一种关系，一定程度上与距离无关，就是把岛屿与邻近大陆分开的海水深度和两地好歹有变异的相同或亲缘哺乳类物种存在的关系。埃尔（Windsor Earl）先生对这个问题做过一些发人深省的观察，涉及大马来群岛，以一条深海的空间在西里伯斯（Celebes）附近隔开，分隔出两个十分不同的哺乳类世界。这些岛两边的海都是相当浅的大陆架，岛上有相同的或密切近似的四足兽栖息。这个大群岛无疑出现了少数异常情形，对于某些个案很难形成判断，某些哺乳类通过人类的作用有可能归化。但是华莱士先生满腔热情的研究很快让群岛的博物史大白于天下。我还来不及跟进这个问题在世界各地的情形；但是据我研究所及，这种关系一般是正确的。例如，不列颠和欧洲被一条浅海峡隔开，两边的哺乳类是相同的；澳洲海岸浅海峡对岸的许多岛屿也是这样。另一方面，西印度诸岛位于下沉很深的沙洲上，深度几达1000英寻，那里找到了美洲的类型，但是物种甚至属却不同。由于所有个案的变化量一定程度上取决于时间的长短，而且在水平变化时由浅海峡隔离的岛屿显然比由深海峡隔离的更有可能在近代与大陆持续连成一片，所以能够理解，海水深度和海岛哺乳类与邻近大陆哺乳类的亲缘程度之间往往存在着关系——这种关系根据独立创造的学说是讲不通的。

以上是关于海洋岛生物的叙述——即，物种数稀少——某些纲或者纲的部分中本地的特有类型很丰富——整个群，如两栖类和陆栖哺乳类，全部缺如，但能飞的蝙蝠是存在的——某些植物目表现特别的比例——草本类型发展成乔木，等等——在我看来，似乎更符合在悠久过程中偶然输送的方法普遍有效的观点，而不是一切海洋岛以前曾和最近大陆由连续陆地连在一起的观点。因为按照后一观点，移入也许会更彻底，同时根据生物间关系头等重要的因素，如果允许，一切生物类型会发生相等的变异。

要理解较遥远岛屿上的若干生物（不管仍保持同一物种的类型还是抵达以后发生变化）究竟如何到达现在的家乡，我不否认是存在许多严重难点的。但是，决不能忽视，许多岛屿曾经作为歇脚点，而现在没有留下一点遗迹。我愿详细说明一个困难的例子。几乎一切海洋岛，哪怕是最孤立、最小的海洋岛，都有陆栖贝类栖息着，一般是本地特有的物种，但有时是其他地方也有的物种。古尔德博士曾举出若干太平洋岛屿陆栖贝类的有趣例子。众所周知，陆栖贝类容易被海水杀死；贝卵，至少是我试验过的卵，在海水里下沉并且被杀死了。可是我认为一定还有某些未知但非常有效的方法来输送它们。刚孵化的幼体有时会不会附着于栖息在地上的鸟的脚上而输送过去呢？我想起休眠时期贝壳口上具有薄膜的陆栖贝类，在漂流木的隙缝中可以浮过相当阔的海湾。并且我发现有几个物种在这种状态下沉没在海水里七天而不受损害：一种是罗马蜗牛（Helix pomatia）经过这样处理以后，在休眠中再放人海水中二十天，能够完全复活。这种蜗牛具有一片厚的石灰质厣（operculum），我把厣除去，等到新的膜厣形成以后，再把它浸入海水里十四天，它还是会复活，并且爬走了。这方面需要做更多的试验。

关于岛上物种对我们来说最触目惊心最重要的事实是，与最近大陆的并不实际相同的物种有亲缘关系。这一点能够举出无数的例子来。这里举一例，位于赤道的加拉帕戈斯群岛距离南美洲的海岸有500—600英里之远。那里几乎每一陆上和水里的生物都带着明确无误的美洲大陆的印记。有二十六种陆栖鸟，其中二十五种被古尔德先生列为不同的物种，而且被假定是在那里创造出来的；可是这些鸟的大多数与美洲物种的密切亲缘关系，表现在每一性状上，习性、姿势和鸣声上。其他动物也是如此。胡克博士在所著该群岛的植物志大作中说，大部分植物也是这样。学者们在离开大陆几百英里远的太平洋火山岛上观察生物时，会感到自己是站在美洲大陆上。为什么会这样呢？为什么假定加拉帕戈斯群岛而不是其他地方创造出来的物种这样清楚地和美洲创造出来的物种有亲缘关系印记呢？在生活条件、岛上的地质、岛的高度或气候方面，在共同居住的几个纲的比例方面，没有一件是与南美沿岸的条件密切相似的：事实上，在所有这些方面都是区别相当大的。另一方面，加拉帕戈斯群岛和佛得角群岛，在土壤的火山性质、气候、高度和岛的大小方面，则有相当程度的类似：但是它们的生物却是何等完全和绝对地不同呀！佛得角群岛的生物与非洲相关联，就像加拉帕戈斯群岛的生物与美洲相关联一样。我认为，对于这伟大的事实，根据独立创造的一般观点是得不到任何解释的；相反的，根据本书所主张的观点，显然，加拉帕戈斯群岛很可能接受从美洲来的移住者，不管这是由于偶然的输送方法，还是以前是连续的陆地。而且佛得角群岛也接受从非洲来的移住者；这样的移住者虽然容易发生变异——而传承的原理依然泄露了其原产地在何处。

能够举出许多类似的事实：岛上的特有生物与最近大陆、最近大岛上的生物相关联，实在是一个近乎普遍的规律。例外是少数，并且大部分的例外是可以解释的。例如，虽然凯尔盖朗岛距离非洲比美洲近，但是从胡克博士的报告里可以知道，植物却与美洲相关联，并且关联得很密切。但是根据岛上植物主要是借顺风海流漂来的冰山把种子连着泥土石块带来的观点看来，异常就消失了。新西兰在本地特有植物上与最近的大陆澳洲之间的关联比其他地区更密切。这是可想而知的，但是它又清楚地与南美洲相关联，南美洲虽说是第二个最近的大陆，可离得那么遥远，所以就成为异常了。但是根据下述观点看来，这个难点就部分地消失了：新西兰、南美洲和其他南方陆地的一部分生物是从一个近乎中间的虽然遥远的地点即南极诸岛而来的，那是冰期开始前南极诸岛长满了植物的时候。澳洲西南角和好望角的植物群的亲缘关系虽然薄弱，但是胡克博士使我确信这种关系是真实的，这是更值得注意的个案，目前无法解释；但是这种亲缘关系只限于植物，并且无疑将来会得到解释。

导致异物种的群岛生物和最近大陆生物之间有亲缘关系的法则，有时可以小规模但极有趣地在同一群岛的范围内表现出来。例如，如前所述，加拉帕戈斯群岛各离岛上都奇特地有亲缘物种栖息着；这些离岛物种彼此不同种，但之间的关联比与世界其他地区无疑更加密切。按我的观点，这是可想而知的，因为这样接近的岛屿几乎必然地会从同一根源接受移住者，也彼此接受移住者。但是离岛特有生物之间的不同可能被用来反对我的观点：试问，许多移住者在彼此相望的，具有同一地质性质，同一高度、气候等的诸岛上怎么会发生不同的（虽然差别不大）变异呢？长久以来这对我是个难点，但这主要是出于认为一地区的物理条件头等重要这一根深蒂固的错误观点；然而我认为无可辩驳的是，各物种必须进行竞争，因而其他物种的性质至少也是同等重要的，并且一般是更加重要的成功要素。现在，如果观察栖息在加拉帕戈斯群岛同时也见于世界各地的物种（暂时撇下特有物种，这里无法公平讨论，因为当前是考虑物种到达后如何渐渐变异的），就可以发现各岛上有相当大的差异。如果认为岛屿生物曾由偶然的输送方法而来——比方说，一种植物的种子被带到一个岛上，另一种植物的种子被带到另一个岛上，那么上述的差异的确是可以预料到的。因此，一种移住者在以前时期内在诸岛中的一个或多个岛上定居下来时，或者以后在诸岛间散布时，无疑会遭遇到不同岛上的不同条件，因为势必要与一批不同的生物进行竞争。比方说，一种植物在各岛上会遇到最适合的土地已被不同的物种所完美地或者欠完美地占据，还会受到多少不同的敌人的打击。如果这物种就此变异了，自然选择就会在不同岛上有利于不同变种的产生。尽管如此，有些物种还会散布开去，并且在整个群中保持同一性状，正如我们看到一个大陆上广泛散布的物种保持着同一性状一样。

加拉帕戈斯群岛这一个案以及在程度较差的某些类似的例子里，真正奇异的事实是，每一新物种在各岛上一旦形成，并不迅速散布到其他岛上。但是，这些岛虽然隔海相望，却有很深的海湾分开，大多比不列颠海峡还要宽，并且没有理由去设想以前是连续地联结在一起的。诸岛之间海流湍急，大风异常稀少；所以诸岛彼此的分离远比地图上所表现的更加明显。虽然如此，世界各地可以找到的和只见于这群岛的许多物种，是各岛共有的；根据某些事实可以推想，它们是从一个岛散布到众岛去的。但是，我想，往往对于密切近似物种自由往来时，便有侵占对方领土的可能性，采取了错误的观点。毫无疑问，如果一个物种比其他物种占有任何优势，就会在很短的时间内全部或部分淘汰对方；但是如果两者能同样好地适应在自然界的位置，那么大概都会坚守阵地，并且分开至几乎任何长的时间。我们熟悉经过人的媒介而归化的许多物种曾经以惊人的速度在新地区里进行散布，就会容易推想大多数物种也是这样散布的；但应该记住，在新地区归化的物种与土著生物一般并不是密切近似的，而是很不相同的物种，如德康多尔所阐明的，在大多数情形下不是同属的。在加拉帕戈斯群岛，甚至许多鸟类，虽然那么适于从一个岛飞到另一个岛，但在不同的岛上还是不同种的。例如，效舌鸫（mocking-thrush）有三个密切近似的物种，每一个物种只局限于自己的岛上。现在，让我们设想查塔姆岛的效舌鸫被风吹到查尔斯岛（Charles），而后者已有另一种效舌鸫：为什么它该成功地定居在那里呢？可以稳妥地推论，查尔斯岛已经繁生着自己的物种，每年产生的蛋多得根本养育不活；还可以推论，查尔斯岛所特有的效舌鸫对于自己家乡的良好适应，至少不比查塔姆岛的特有物种差。赖尔爵士和沃拉斯顿先生曾经写信告诉我一个与本问题有关的重要事实；即马德拉和附近的圣港（Porto Santo）小岛具有许多不同而表现为代表物种的陆栖贝类，其中有些生活在石缝里；虽然有大量石块每年从圣港输送到马德拉，可是马德拉并没有圣港的物种移住进来；相反，两岛上都有欧洲的陆栖贝类栖息着，无疑比本地物种占有某些优势。根据这些观察，我想，对于加拉帕戈斯群岛诸岛特有的代表物种并没有普遍散布，就不必大惊小怪了。再者，同一大陆上，先入为主对于阻止相同物理条件下栖息的不同地区的物种混入，大概有重要的作用。例如，澳洲的东南部和西南部物理条件几乎相同，并且由连续的陆地连着，可是有巨大数量的不同哺乳类、鸟类和植物栖息着。

决定海岛动植物通性的这一原理，在整个自然界有着最广泛的应用，即移住者尽管不同种，却与它们最容易迁出的原产地关系明显，以后移住者变异，更好地适应新家。在每一山顶、湖泊和沼泽里都可看到这个原理，因为高山物种都与周围低地的物种相关联，除非同一类型，主要是植物，在冰期已经全世界广泛散布。例如，南美洲的高山蜂鸟、高山啮齿类、高山植物等，一切都严格属于美洲的类型；而且显然，一座山缓慢隆起时，生物自然会从周围的低地移来。湖泊沼泽的生物也是这样，除非极方便的输送允许同一普遍类型散布到全世界。从美洲和欧洲穴居的盲目动物，也可看到这同一原理。还能举出其他类似的事实。我相信，以下情形将被认为是普遍正确的，即两个地区不管距离多远，凡有许多密切近似或代表的物种存在，在那里便一定也有某些相同的物种。根据上述观点，它们会表明以前两个地区曾经有相互交流或迁徙。不管在什么地方，凡有许多密切近似的物种，那里也会有被某些学者列为不同物种而被其他学者列为变种的许多类型；可疑类型向我们示明了变异过程中的步骤。

某物种在现在或古代不同环境下的迁徙能力和迁徙范围，与亲缘物种在世界遥远地点的存在有关系，这以另一普通的方式表示出来。古尔德先生很久以前告诉我，在世界各处散布的那些鸟属中，许多物种分布范围是广阔的。我不能怀疑这条规律是普遍正确的，虽然其很难被证明。在哺乳类中，我们看见这条规律显著地表现在蝙蝠中，并以较小的程度表现在猫科和狗科里。比较蝴蝶和甲虫的分布，可看到同样的规律。淡水生物大多数也是这样，有许多属分布在世界各处，而且许多物种具有广大的分布范围。这并不是说，在分布全世界的属里一切物种都广泛分布，也不是说平均起来属于广泛分布，而是说其中某些物种有很广阔的分布范围，因为平均分布范围大部分取决于广泛分布的物种变异产生新类型的难易程度。比方说，同一物种的两个变种栖息在美洲和欧洲，因此这个物种就有很广的分布范围；但是，如果变异进行得更厉害，两个变种就会被列为不同的物种，共同的分布范围就大大缩小了。这更不是说，表面上能越过障碍物而分布广远的物种，如某些善飞的鸟类，就必然分布得很广。永远不要忘记，分布广远不仅意味着具有越过障碍物的能力，而且意味着具有在遥远地区与异地同住者进行生存斗争并获胜这种更加重要的能力。但是按照一属的一切物种，虽然分布到世界最遥远的地点，都是从单一祖先传下来的观点，就应该找到，并且我相信我们一般确能找到，至少某些物种是分布得很广远的。因为未变异祖先一定要广泛分布，在分散过程中进行变异，一定要使自己处于各种环境中，有利于将后代先变成新变种，最终变成新物种。

考察某些属的广泛分布时，应该记住，许多属的起源都是很古的，共同的祖先在遥远的古代必定出现分叉；在这种情形下，物种将有大量的时间经历气候和地理大变迁，以及偶然的输送，结果某些物种迁徙到了世界各地，在散布地根据新环境可能略微变异。从地质的证据看来，也有理由相信，在每一个大的纲里比较低等的生物的变化速率，比起高等类型一般更加缓慢，结果就会分布广远而仍然有保持同一物种性状的较好机会。这个事实，外加许多低级类型的种子和卵都很细小，适于远地输送，也许说明了一个早经观察到的法则，即任何群的生物越低级，分布得越广远；最近又有德康多尔在植物方面讨论过这一点。

刚刚讨论过的关系——即变化缓慢的低等生物比高等生物分布更加广远，——分布广远的属，其某些物种的分布也广远，——高山、湖泊和沼泽的生物与周围低地和干地的生物有关联（例外情况前面已经明确），尽管环境十分不同，诸如此类——同一群岛中诸岛上的不同物种有密切的亲缘关系，——特别是整个群岛或岛屿上的生物和最近大陆的生物之间有显著关系，——我想，根据各物种独立创造的普通观点，这些事实都是完全得不到解释的，但是如果承认从最近的或最便利的原产地的移居以及移居者以后对于新家乡的变异适应，这就可以得到解释。




前章和本章提要。——这两章竭力阐明，如果充分承认我们自己对于近代必然发生过的气候、陆地水平变化以及可能发生过的其他变化所产生的全部影响是无知的；如果记得我们自己对于许多奇妙的偶然输送方法是何等无知——这个题目还没有得到适当的实验验证；如果记得，一个物种在广大面积上连续地分布，而后在中间地带灭绝了，是何等频繁发生的事情——那么，我认为要相信同一物种的一切个体，不管是在哪里发现的，都传自共同的祖先，就没有不可克服的困难了。我们根据各种一般的论点，特别是根据各种障碍物的重要性，并且根据亚属、属和科的相类似的分布，得出上述结论，许多学者在单一创造中心的名称下也得出这一结论。

至于同一属的不同物种，按照我的理论，必定是从一个原产地散布出去的；如果我们像前面那样承认自己的无知，记得某些生物类型变化得很缓慢，因而有大量时间可供它们迁徙，那么难点决不是不能克服的；虽然在这种情形下，就像在同一物种的个体的情形下一样，难点往往是很大的。

为了说明气候变化对于分布的影响，我试图阐明最近的一次冰期发生过多么重要的作用，我坚信它同时影响了全世界，至少触及大径向带。为了说明偶然的输送方法是何等丰富多彩，我略为详细地讨论了淡水生物的散布方法。

如果承认同一物种以及关联物种的个体在时间的悠久过程中曾经从同一原产地出发，并没有不可克服的难点；那么地理分布的一切主要事实，我想都可以依据迁徙（一般指优势生物类型）的理论，以及此后新类型的变异和繁生，得到解释。这样，我们便能理解，水陆障碍物在分开各个动植物区域上有至关重要的作用。这样，我们还能理解亚属、属、科的定位，在不同的纬度下，比方说在南美洲，平原和山上的生物，森林、沼泽和沙漠的生物，如何以神秘的方式因亲缘关联起来，并且同样的与过去栖息在同一大陆上的灭绝生物相关联。如果记住生物之间的相互关系是至关重要的，我们就能明白为什么具有几乎相同物理条件的两个地区常常栖息着很不相同的生物类型；因为根据移住者进入一个地区以来所经过的时间长度；根据交流性质容许某些类型而不是其他类型以或多或少的数量迁入；根据那些移入的生物是否碰巧相互以及与土著生物进行或多或少的直接竞争；并且根据移入的生物发生变异的快慢，所以在不同的地区里就会发生与物理条件无关的无限多样性的生活条件，——那里就会有几乎无限量的有机的作用和反作用，——并且我们就会发现某些群的生物大大地变异了，某些群的生物只是轻微地变异了，——某些群的生物大量发展了，某些群的生物仅以微小的数量存在着——的确可以在世界上几个大的地理区里看到这种情形。

依据这些同样的原理，如我曾经竭力阐明的，我们便能理解，为什么海洋岛只有少数生物，而其中有一大部分又是本地所特有的；由于与迁徙方法的关系，为什么一群生物的一切物种，甚至同纲生物的一切物种都是本地特有的，而另一群的一切生物都与世界各地共有。我们能明白为什么整个群的生物，如两栖类和陆栖哺乳类，不存在于海洋岛上，同时最孤立的岛也有自己特有的空中哺乳类即蝙蝠的物种。我们还能明白，为什么在岛上存在的或多或少经过变异的哺乳类和这些岛与大陆之间的海洋深度有某种关系。我们能清楚地知道，为什么一个群岛的一切生物，虽然在若干小岛上具有不同的物种，然而彼此有密切的关系；并且和最近大陆或移住者发源的其他可能原产地的生物同样有关系，不过关系较不密切。我们更能知道，两个地区不论相距多么远，为什么总可以找到关联的物种，表现为相同物种、变种、可疑物种、不同但代表物种的存在。

正如已故的福布斯所经常主张的，生命法则在整个时间空间中有惊人的平行现象：支配生物类型在过去时期内演替的法则与支配生物类型在今日不同地区内的差异的法则，几乎是相同的。在许多事实中可以看到这种情形。在时间上每一物种和每一群物种的存在都是连续的；因为对这一规律的例外少之又少，其例外可以正当地归因于我们还没有在中间的沉积层里发现某些类型，这些类型不见于其中，却见于它的上部和下部：在空间内也是这样，一般规律肯定是，一个物种或一群物种所栖息的地区是连续的，而例外的情形虽然不少，如我曾经想阐明的，都可以根据以前在不同情况下的迁徙，或者根据偶然的输送方法，或者根据物种在中间地带的灭绝而得到解释。在时间、空间里，物种以及物种群都有其发展的极大点。生存在某一时期、某一地区的物种群，常常有共同的微细特征，如刻纹或颜色。当我们观察过去悠久的连续时代时，正如现在观察整个世界的遥远地区，发现某些物种彼此之间的差异很小，而不同纲、不同目、同目不同科的物种彼此之间的差异却很大。在时间、空间里，每一纲的低级体制的成员比高级体制一般变化较少；但是在这两种情形里，这条规律都有显著的例外。按照我的理论，贯穿时间空间的这些关系是可以理解的；因为不论观察同一地区连续时代中发生变化的生物类型，还是观察迁入遥远地方以后曾经发生变化的生物类型，同一纲内的类型都被普通世代的同一个纽带联结起来；任何两个类型的血缘越近，则在时空中彼此一般靠得越近。在这两种情形里，变异法则都是一样的，而且变异都是由同一个自然选择的力量累积起来的。





第十三章　生物的相互亲缘关系：形态学、胚胎学、残迹器官


分类学，群下有群——自然系统——分类学规则和难点，依据变异传承学说来解释——变种的分类——传承常用于分类学——同功的或适应的性状——一般的，复杂的，放射状的亲缘关系——灭绝分开并界定生物群——同纲成员之间、同个体各部分之间的形态学——胚胎学的法则，依据不在幼龄发生、而在相应年龄遗传的变异来解释——残迹器官；其起源的解释——提要

从生命曙光初照起，就发现生物彼此相似程度的逐渐递减，所以群下可以再分成群。这种分类显然并不像星座中星体分类那样武断。如果说某一群排他性地适于陆栖，而另一群适于水栖，一群适于吃肉，而另一群适于吃素等等，群的存在就是简单标识了；但是事实却是五花八门的，因为大家都知道，甚至同一亚群里的成员往往也具有不同的习性。第二章和第四章讨论变异和自然选择时，我试图阐明，变异最多的，是分布广的、散布大的常见物种，即大属里的优势物种。我认为，由此产生的变种即初始物种最后可以转化成不同的新物种；且这些物种，依据遗传的原理，倾向于产生其他新的优势物种。结果，现在的大群，一般含有许多优势物种，还有继续无限增大的倾向。我还企图进一步阐明，由于每一物种变化着的后代都尝试在自然组成中占据尽可能多和尽可能不同的位置，就永远有性状分歧的倾向。观察任何小地区内类型繁多，竞争激烈，以及有关归化的某些事实，便可支持这个结论。

我还试图阐明，数量上增加着的、性状上分歧的类型有一种持续的倾向来淘汰消灭先前的、分歧较少和改进较少的类型。请读者参阅以前解释过的用来说明这几个原理之作用的图解，便可明白，无可避免的结果是，来自一个祖先的变异后代在群下又分裂成群。图解里，顶线上每一字母代表一个包括几个物种的属；且这条顶线上所有的属共同形成一个纲，因为全都是从一个古代无形祖先传下来的，所以遗传了一些共同的东西。但是，依据同一个原理，左边的三个属有很多共同点，形成一个亚科，与右边相邻的两个属所形成的亚科不同，那是在传承第五个阶段从一个共同祖先分歧出来的。这五个属仍然有许多共同点，虽然比前面两个少些；它们组成一个科，与更右边、更早时期分歧出来的那三个属所形成的科不同。所有这些属都是从A传承下来的，组成一个目，与I传下来的属不同目。这里有单个祖先传下来的许多物种组成了属；属组成了亚科、科和目，这一切都纳入一个纲。所以，生物在群下又分成群的从属关系这个伟大博物学事实（由于司空见惯，并不总是引起我们足够的注意），依我看有了充分的解释。

学者们试图依据所谓的自然系统来排列每一纲的物种、属和科。但是这个系统的意义是什么呢？有些作者认为它只是一种方案，把最相似的生物排列在一起，把最不相似的生物分开；还有人认为是尽可能简要地表明一般命题的人为方法——就是说，用一句话来描述例如一切哺乳类所共有的性状，用另一句话来描述一切食肉类所共有的性状，再用另一句话来描述狗属所共有的性状，然后再加一句话来全面描述每一种类的狗。这个系统的巧妙和效用是不容置疑的。但是许多学者认为，自然系统的含义要更丰富：相信它揭示了造物主的计划；但是关于造物主的计划，除非能明确它的时空次序，或者还有其他什么意义，否则，依我看来，我们的知识并没有因此得到任何补益。像林奈所提出的那句名言，我们常看到它以一种多少隐晦的形式出现，即不是性状创造属，而是属产生性状，这似乎意味着分类学内容有比单纯类似更深刻的东西。我相信内容不止这些，因为传承的亲缘——生物密切类似的唯一已知原因——就是这种联系纽带，虽然有各种不同程度的变异而掩藏，但分类学部分地将其揭露了。

让我们考虑一下分类学所采用的规则，以及依据这种观点所遭遇的困难：分类要么显示某种未知的创造计划，要么干脆是表明一般命题的方案，用来把彼此最相似的类型归在一起。有人认为（古人就这样认为）决定生活习性以及每一生物在自然组成中的一般位置的那些构造部分，对分类学至关重要。没有比这种想法更错误的了。没有人认为老鼠和鼩鼱（shrew）、儒艮和鲸鱼、鲸鱼和鱼的外在类似有任何重要性。这等类似，虽然与生物的全部生活如此密切相关，却仅被列为“适应的或同功的性状”；关于这等类似，容后再来讨论。任何部分的体制与特殊习性关联越少，在分类学上就越重要，这甚至可以说是普遍规律。例如，欧文讲到儒艮时说道，“生殖器官作为与动物的习性和食物关系最少的器官，我总认为它们最清楚地表示真实的亲缘关系。在这些器官的变异中，很少可能把只是适应的性状误认为主要的性状”。关于植物，最不重要的是生命所依赖的营养器官，除了第一次主要分野；相反的，最重要的却是生殖器官以及它们的产物种子，这是多么令人瞩目！

因此，分类时切不可信任部分体制的相似性，不管它们相对于外部世界来说对生物的利益有多么重要。也许就为了这个原因，部分造成了绝大部分学者最最重视生活、生理上至关重要的器官的相似性。这种挟重要器官为重的分类学观点无疑大致不错，但并非永远正确。我认为，器官在分类学上的重要性取决于其在整个物种大群中的更大恒定性，而这个恒定性取决于这种器官在物种适应生活条件时普遍有较少的变化。器官的单纯生理上的重要性并不决定分类学价值，一个事实就几乎证明了这一点，即在近似的群中，虽然有充分理由设想，同一器官具有几乎相同的生理价值，但其分类学价值却大不相同。学者研究过某一群，无不被这个事实打动；几乎每一位作者都充分承认这个事实。这里只引述最高权威罗伯特·布朗的话就够了；他在讲到山龙眼科（Proteaceae）的某些器官时，说到其在属方面的重要性，“像它们的所有器官一样，不仅在这一科中，而且据我所知在每一自然的科中都是很不相等的，并且在某些情形下，似乎完全消失了”。还有，他在另一著作中说，“牛栓藤科（Connaraceae）的各属在单子房或多子房上，在胚乳的有无上，在花蕾里花瓣做覆瓦状或镊合状上，都是不同的。这些性状的任何一种，单独讲时，其重要性经常在属以上，但合在一起讲时，甚至不足以区别纳斯蒂属（Cnestis）和牛栓藤（Connarus）”。举一个昆虫的例子：膜翅目一个大支群里，照韦斯特伍德所说，触角是最恒定的构造；另一支群里则差异很大，而这差异在分类学上只有十分次要的价值；可是也许没有人会说，在同一目的两个支群里，触角具有不同等的生理重要性。同一群生物的同一重要器官在分类学上有不同的重要性，这方面的例子不胜枚举。

再者，没有人会说残迹器官在生理上或生活上有高度的重要性；可是毫无疑问，这种状态的器官在分类学上经常有很大的价值。没有人会反对幼小反刍类上颚中的残迹齿以及腿上某些残迹骨片在显示反刍类和厚皮类之间的密切亲缘关系上是高度有用的。布朗曾经极力主张，残迹小花的位置在禾本科草类的分类上有极度的重要性。

关于那些必须认为生理上很不重要的、但普遍认为在整个群的定义上高度有用的部分所显示的性状，可以举出无数的事例。例如，从鼻孔到口腔是否有个通道，欧文认为这是区别鱼类和爬行类的唯一性状——有袋类的下颚角度的变化——昆虫翅膀的折叠状态——某些藻类的颜色——禾本科草类的花在各部分上的细毛——脊椎动物的真皮被覆物（如毛或羽毛）的性质。如果鸭嘴兽被覆的是羽毛而不是毛，那么我想这种不重要的外部性状将会被学者认为有助于决定这种奇怪生物与鸟类和爬行类的亲缘度，其重要性不亚于任何重要内部器官的构造接近。

微小性状的分类学重要性，主要取决于其与若干其他多多少少重要的性状的关联。性状的总体价值在博物学中确是很明显的。因此，正如经常指出的，一个物种可以在几种性状（生理上很重要，几乎无往不胜）上与它的近似物种相区别，可是对于它应该排列在哪里，我们却毫不怀疑。因此，也已经发现，依据任何单种性状来分类，不管这种性状如何重要，总是失败的；因为体制上没有一个部分是普遍恒定的。性状的总体重要性，即使其中没有一个性状是重要的，我想也可以单独说明林奈的格言，即不是性状产生属，而是属产生性状；因为此格言的根据似乎是体会到了许多难于定义的轻微类似点。金虎尾科（Malpighiaceae）的某些植物具有完全的和退化的花；关于后者，朱西厄（A．de Jussieu）说，“物种、属、科、纲所固有的性状，大部分都消失了，这是对分类学的嘲笑”。当斯克巴属（Aspicarpa）在法国几年内只产生退化的花，而与这一目的固有模式在构造的许多最重要方面如此惊人地不合时，朱西厄说，里查德（M．Richard）却敏智地看出这一属还应该保留在金虎尾科里。此个案似乎很好地说明了分类学的精神。

实际上，学者进行分类工作时，对于定义一个群、排列任何物种所用的性状，并不费心注意其生理价值。如果找到一种近乎一致的为许多类型所共有而不为其他类型所共有的性状，就当作具有高度价值的性状来应用；如果为少数类型所共有，就把它当作具有次等价值的性状来应用。有些学者公开主张这是正确的原则，而植物学家圣提雷尔尤为明确。如果几种性状总是关联出现，虽然其间没有发现显然的联系纽带，也会赋予特殊的价值。在大多数的动物群中，重要的器官，例如压送血液的器官或输送空气给血液的器官，或繁殖种族的器官，如果是差不多一致的，分类学上就认为是高度有用的；但是在某些群里，所有这些最重要的生活器官只能提供次要价值的性状。

我们知道为什么胚胎的性状与成体有相等的重要性，因为分类学当然包括一切龄期在内。但是普通的观点并没有明确，为什么胚胎构造在分类学上比成体更重要，而在自然组成中只有成体构造才能充分发挥作用。可是大学者爱德华兹和阿加西斯极力主张胚胎的性状在分类学中是最重要的性状；而且公认这种理论是正确的。显花植物就是这样，其两个主要区分是依据胚胎性状，即子叶的数目和位置，以及胚芽和胚根的发育方式。讨论胚胎学时就要看到，为什么这些性状如此有价值，因为分类学观点暗含了传承的观念。

分类学往往明显地受到亲缘链的影响。没有比定义所有鸟类所共有的若干性状更容易的了；但是在甲壳类个案里，这样的定义至今还难上加难。有些甲壳类处于两极端，几乎没有一种共同的性状；可是两极端的物种，因为明显与其他物种相近似，而这些物种又与另一些物种相近似，这样关联下去，便可确认它们不含糊地属于关节动物这一纲，而不是其他纲。

地理分布也常应用，特别是被用在密切近似类型的大群的分类中，虽然这并不十分符合逻辑。覃明克（Temminck）主张这个方法在鸟类的某些群中是有用的，甚至是必要的；若干昆虫学者和植物学者也曾采用过此法。

最后，关于各个物种群，如目、亚目、科、亚科和属等的比较价值，依我看来，至少现在，几乎是任意估定的。若干最优秀的植物学家如本瑟姆先生等人，都强烈主张它们的任意价值。能够举出一些有关植物和昆虫方面的事例，例如，有一群起初被训练有素的植物学者只列为一个属，然后提升到亚科或科的等级；这样做并不是因为进一步的研究探查到起初忽视的重要构造差异，而是因为后来发现了具有稍微不同级进的各种差异的无数近似物种。

上述分类学上的规则、辅助手段和难点，如果我的想法没有多大错误，都可以根据下述观点得到解释，即，自然系统是以伴随着变异的传承为根据的；学者们认为两个以上物种间那些表明真实亲缘关系的性状都是从共同祖先遗传下来的，一切真实的分类学都是依据家系的；共同的传承就是学者们无意识地追求的潜在纽带，而不是什么未知的创造计划，也不是一般命题的说明，把多少相似的对象简单地合在一起和分开。

但是我必须更充分地说明己见。我认为各个纲里的群按照适当的从属关系和相互关系排列，必须严格按照家系，才能达到自然的分类；不过若干分支或群，虽与共同祖先血统关系的近似程度相等，由于变异程度不同，差异量却大有区别；这就表现为类型列入不同的属、科、部或目之中。如果读者费神去参阅第四章的图解，就会很好理解这里的意思。假定从A到L代表生存于志留纪的近似的属，是从存在于更早的未知时期的物种传下来的。其中三个属（A、F和I）中，都有物种传留下变异的后代直到今天，表示为最高横线上的十五个属（a14到z14）。那么，从单一物种传下来的所有这些变异的后代，在血统上即传承上都有同等程度的关系；可以比喻为第一百万代的同胞，但彼此之间有着广泛的差异，且程度不同。从A传下来、现在分成两三个科的类型组成一个目，不同于从I传下来的目，它也分成两个科。从A传下来的现存物种已不能与亲种A归入同一个属；从I传下来的物种也不能与亲种I归入同一个属。可以假定现存的属F14只有稍微的改变，可以和祖属F同归一属，正像少数现在仍然生存的生物属于志留纪的属一样。所以，这些在血统上都以同等程度彼此关联的生物之间所表现的差异量或者价值，就大不相同了。虽然如此，它们的家系排列不仅现在是真实的，而且在传承的每一连续的时期中也是真实的。从A传下来的一切变异后代，都从共同祖先遗传了某些共同的东西，从I传下来的一切后代也是这样；在每一连续的阶段上，后代的每一从属的分支也都是这样。但是如果假定A或I的任何后代变异太大，彻底丧失了其出身的痕迹，于是，其自然分类系统中的位置就彻底丧失了，某些现存的生物好像发生过这种事情。F属的一切后代，沿着整个传承线，假定只有很少的变化，就形成单独的一个属。但是这个属虽然很孤立，将仍然占据应有的中间位置；F本来就是A和I的中间性状，而这两个属传承下来的各个属，会在一定程度上遗传其性状。这种自然排列，这里尽可能用平面的图解表示，但未免过分简单。如果不使用分枝图，而只把群的名称简单地写在一条直线上，就更不可能表示自然排列了；大家知道，自然界中在同一群生物间所发现的亲缘关系，用平面上的一条线来表示，显然是不可能的。所以，按照我的观点，自然系统就和宗谱一样，在排列上是依据家系的；但是不同群所经历的变异量，必须用列在不同的所谓属、亚科、科、部、目和纲里的方法来表示。

值得举一个语言的例子来说明这种分类学观点。如果我们拥有人类的完整谱系，那么人种谱系的排列就会对现在全世界所用的各种语言提供最好的分类；如果一切灭绝的语言以及一切中间性质和逐渐变化着的方言也必须包括在内，那么我想这样的排列将是唯一可能的分类。然而，某些古代语言可能变得很少，产生的新语言也少，而其他古代语言由于同宗的各族在散布、继而隔离和文明状态方面的原因曾经改变很大，因此产生了许多新的方言和语言。同一语系诸语言之间的各种程度的差异，必须用群下有群的分类方法来表示；但是正当的，甚至唯一应有的排列还是谱系的排列；这将是严格自然的，因为它依据最密切的亲缘关系把灭绝的和现代的一切语言联结在一起，并且表明每一语言的分支和起源。

为了证实这一观点，让我们看一看变种的分类，变种是已经知道或者相信从单个物种传下来的。这些变种群集在物种之下，亚变种又集在变种之下；在某些情形下，如家鸽，还必须有其他等级的差异。变种群下有群的来源和物种相同，即传承密切，变异程度不同。变种分类所依据的规则和物种大致相同。作者们坚决主张依据自然系统而不依据人为系统来排列变种的必要性；比方说，我们被提醒不要单纯因为凤梨的果实——虽然这是最重要的部分——碰巧大致相同，就把其两个变种分类在一起；没有人把瑞典芜菁和普通芜菁归在一起，虽然它们可供食用的、肥大的茎是如此相似。哪一部分是最恒定的，哪一部分就会用于变种的分类：例如，大农学家马歇尔说，角在牛的分类中很有用，因为比身体的形状或颜色等变异要小，而在绵羊的分类中，角的用处则大大减少，因为较不恒定。在变种的分类中，我认为如果我们有真实的谱系，就会普遍地采用谱系分类；并且几位作者已试用过。因为可以肯定，不管有多少变异，遗传原理总会把那些相似点最多的类型聚合在一起。关于翻飞鸽，虽然某些亚变种在喙长这一重要性状上有所不同，可是由于都有翻飞的共同习性，还是被聚合在一起；但是短面的品种已经几乎或者完全丧失了这种习性：虽然如此，我们并不考虑这个问题，还是把它和其他翻飞鸽归入一群，因为它们在血统上相近，同时在其他方面也有类似之处。如果能够证明霍屯督人（Hottentot）是尼格罗人（Negro）的后代，我想就会被分类到黑人这个群，尽管在肤色等重要性状上与尼格罗人如此不同。

关于自然状态下的物种，实际上每一学者都已根据传承进行分类；因为把两性都包括在最低单位，即物种中；而两性有时在最重要性状上表现了何等巨大的差异，学者都知道的：某些蔓足类的雄性成体和雌雄同体的个体之间几乎没有共同之处，可是没有人梦想过把它们分开。学者把同一个体的各种幼体阶段都包括在同一物种中，不管它们彼此之间的差异以及与成体的差异有多大；斯登斯特鲁普（Steenstrup）的所谓交替的世代也是如此，它们只有在学术意义上才被认为属于同一个体。学者又把畸形和变种归在同一物种中，并不是因为与亲类型部分类似，而因为都是从亲类型传下来的。认为樱草传承自报春花属，或者相反传承的人，会把它们列入一个物种，给予一个定义。兰科的三个类型即和尚兰（Monachanthus）、蝇兰（Myanthus）和龙须兰（Catasetum），以前被列为三个不同的属，一旦发现它们有时会在同一植株上产生出来时，就立刻被认为是同种。有人问，如果有人证明，一种袋鼠经过长期的变异从熊产生出来了，那我们怎么办呢？该把它与熊列入一个物种吗？另外那个物种怎么办呢？这种假设当然是无稽之谈，我可以用语无伦次法加以答复，问他如果看到一只完美的袋鼠从熊妈妈肚子里生出来怎么办？按照类比法，它会和熊列在一起，不过那样的话，袋鼠科的全部物种肯定要列入熊属了。整个个案是无稽之谈，因为哪里有共同的密切传承，哪里就当然有密切相似或者亲缘了。

因为血统传承普遍地用来把同一物种的个体分类在一起，虽然雄者、雌者以及幼体有时极不相同；又因为血统用来对发生过一定量的变异，以及有时发生过相当大量变异的变种进行分类，难道血统这同一因素不曾无意识地用来把物种集合成属，把属集合成更高的群？尽管在这种情形下，变异程度更大，完成的时间更长。我相信它已被无意识地应用了；并且只有这样，我才能理解最优秀的分类学者所采用的若干规则和指南。因为没有记载下来的宗谱，便不得不由任何种类的相似之点去追寻血统的共同性。所以才选择那些在每一物种最近所处的生活条件中最不易发生变化的性状，凭判断力进行选择。由此，残迹器官与体制的其他部分在分类学上同样适用，有时甚至更加适用。不管一种性状多么微小——像颚的角度的大小，昆虫翅膀折叠的方式，皮肤被覆着毛或羽毛——如果在许多不同的物种里，尤其是在生活习性很不相同的物种里普遍存在的话，它就取得了高度的价值；因为只能用来自共同祖先的遗传去解释它何以存在于习性如此不同的如此众多的类型里。如果仅仅根据构造上的单独各点，就可能在这方面犯错误，但是当若干无论多么不重要的性状同时存在于习性不同的一大群生物里，从传承说看来，几乎可以肯定这些性状是从共同祖先遗传下来的；并且知道这种集合的性状在分类学上是有特殊价值的。

我们能够理解，为什么一个物种或物种群可以在若干最重要的性状上离开它的近似物种，然而还能稳妥地与它们分类在一起。只要有足够数量的性状，尽管多么不重要，泄露了血统共同性的潜在纽带，就可以稳妥地进行这样的分类，而且是常常这样做的。即使两个类型没有一个性状是共同的，但如果这些极端的类型之间有许多中间群的环节连接在一起，就可以立刻推论出血统的共同性，并且把它们都放在同一个纲里。我们发现生理上具有高度重要性的器官——在最不相同的生存条件下用来保命的器官，一般是最恒定的，就给予特殊的价值；但是，如果这些相同的器官在另一个群或一个群的另一部分中被发现有很大的差异，便立刻在分类学中把它们的价值降低。我们即将清楚知道为什么胚胎的性状在分类学上具有这样高度的重要性。地理分布有时在分布广阔的大属的分类中也可以有效地应用，因为栖息在任何不同孤立地区的同属的一切物种，很可能都是从同一对祖先传下来的。

根据上述观点，我们便能理解真实的亲缘关系与同功的即适应的类似之间有很重要的区别。拉马克首先注意到这个问题，跟进的有麦克里（Macleay）等人。在体形和鳍状前肢上，厚皮动物儒艮和鲸鱼之间的类似，以及这哺乳类和鱼类之间的类似，都是同功的。在昆虫中也有无数的个案。例如，林奈曾被外部表象所误，居然把同翅类的昆虫分类为蛾类。甚至在家养变种中也可以看到大致相同的情形，例如，普通芜菁和瑞典芜菁肥大的茎。面对某些作者在迥然不同的动物间提出的同功比拟，长驱跑狗和赛马的相似，就是小巫见大巫了。根据我关于性状只要揭示血统传承就在分类学上真正重要的观点，就可以清楚地理解，对于生物利益至关重要的同功或适应的性状为什么在分类学上毫无价值了。属于两个最不相同的血统的动物，能轻易变得适应于相似的条件，因而取得外在的密切类似；但是这种类似不但不能揭露它们对于正当传承谱系的血统关系，反而倾向于隐蔽之。我们还能因此理解以下的明显悖论：完全一样的性状，在一个纲、目与另一个比较时是同功的，而在同纲、目的成员相互比较时却能显示真实的亲缘关系。例如，体形和鳍状前肢在鲸与鱼类相比较时只是同功的，都是两个纲对于游水的适应；但是在鲸科的若干成员里，体形和鳍状前肢却是表示真实亲缘关系的性状。因为这些鲸在大大小小的性状上非常一致，不能怀疑它们的体形和肢体构造是从共同祖先传下来的。鱼类的情形也这样。

属于不同纲的物种，因连续的轻微变异常常适应于近似的条件下生活，例如，栖息在水、陆、空三种情况下，因此我们或能理解，为什么会有许多数字上的平行现象有时见于不同纲的亚群之间。学者被任何纲内的这种平行现象所触动，靠任意地提高或降低其他纲中的群的价值（所有经验表明，这种评价至今还是任意的），容易把平行现象扩展到广阔的范围；这样，大概就发生了七项的、五项的、四项的和三项的分类法。

大属优势物种的变异后代，倾向于继承曾使所属的群扩大、使其父母占有优势的优越性，几乎肯定会广为散布，并在自然组成中取得越来越多的地方。较大的优势群因此就倾向于继续增大，结果会把许多弱小群淘汰掉。这样，我们便能解释一切现代和灭绝的生物被包括在少数的大目、更少的纲里，还全部容纳在一个大的自然系统内。一个惊人的事实可以阐明，较高级的群在数目上是多么少，而在全世界的散布又是何等广泛，发现澳洲后并未增加可立新目的昆虫；而在植物界，我从胡克博士那里得知，只增加了两三个小目。

“论生物的地质演替”一章根据每一群的性状在长期连续的变异过程中一般分歧很大的原理，试图表明为什么较古老的生物类型的性状常常略微介于现存群之间。因为少数古老的中间亲类型偶尔把变异很少的后代遗留到今天，这就有了所谓的中间物种（osculant species）或畸变物种（aberrant species）。任何类型越是脱离常规，我看已灭绝而完全消失的联结类型数就一定越多。有证据表明，畸变类型因灭绝而损失严重，因为一般只有极少数的物种；而这类物种即使出现，一般彼此差异也极大，这又意味着灭绝。例如，鸭嘴兽和肺鱼属，如果每一属都不是由独一物种来代表，而是有十多个物种，就不会到脱离常规的程度了；但是，我调查后发现，物种的这种繁荣通常不是畸变属的命运。我想，这一事实只能解释为，把畸变类型看作被成功的竞争者所征服的弱势群，只有少数成员在异常有利条件的巧合下保存下来。

沃特豪斯先生曾指出，当一个动物群的成员与一个不同的群表现有亲缘关系时，这种亲缘关系大多是一般的，而不是特殊的。例如，按照沃特豪斯先生的意见，在一切啮齿类中，绒鼠与有袋类的关系最近；但是在它同这个目接近的诸点中，关系是一般的，并不与任何一个有袋类的物种特别接近。因为两者亲缘关系的诸点据信是真实的，不只是适应性的，按照我的理论，应归因于共同祖先的遗传。所以必须假定，要么一切啮齿类，包括绒鼠在内，从某种远古有袋类分支出来，而后者相对于一切现存的有袋类具有中间的性状；要么啮齿类和有袋类两者都从一个共同祖先分支出来，两个群以后在不同的方向上都发生过大量的变异。不论依据哪种观点，都可以假定绒鼠通过遗传比其他啮齿类保存下了更多的古代祖先性状，所以不会与任何一个现存的有袋类特别有关系，但是由于部分地保存了共同祖先或者这一群的某种早期成员的性状，而间接地与一切或几乎一切有袋类有关系。另一方面，沃特豪斯先生指出，在一切有袋类中，袋熊（phascolomys）不是与啮齿类的任何一个物种，而是与整个啮齿目最相似。但是，在这种情形里，很可以猜测这种类似只是同功的，袋熊已经适应了像啮齿类那样的习性。老德康多尔关于不同目植物的一般性亲缘做过几乎相似的观察。

依据由共同祖先传下来的物种的繁衍和性状逐渐分歧，外加遗传保存若干共同性状的原理，就能理解何以同一科或更高级的群的成员都由非常复杂的辐射形亲缘关系联结在一起。因为通过灭绝而分裂成不同群和亚群的整个科的共同祖先，把某些性状经过不同方式和不同程度的变化遗传给一切物种；结果它们由各种长度的迂回亲缘关系线（正如在常提的那个图解中所看到的）彼此关联起来，通过许多先辈而上升。因为，哪怕有谱系树也不容易示明任何古代贵族家庭无数亲属之间的血统关系，而不依靠这种帮助几乎不可能，所以就能理解，在没有图解帮助下，学者们要想对在同一个大的自然纲里看到的许多现存成员和灭绝成员之间各式各样亲缘关系进行描述，是非常困难的。

正如第四章看到的，灭绝在定义和扩大每一纲里各群之间的距离有着重要的作用。于是，我们认为连接鸟类祖先和其他脊椎动物纲祖先的许多古代生物类型已完全消灭，这甚至可以解释整纲之间界限分明的原因，例如鸟类与所有其他脊椎动物决然不同。曾把鱼类和两栖类联结起来的生物类型的全体灭绝就少见。在某些整个纲里，灭绝得更少，例如甲壳纲，因为在这纲里，最奇异不同的类型仍然可以由一条绵长而断断续续的亲缘关系环节联结在一起。灭绝只能使群分开，而绝没有制造群；因为，曾经在地球上生活过的每一类型如果都突然重现，虽然不可能给每一群以明显的定义，以示区别，因为全部会混在一起，就像最细微的现有变种之间那样存在细微级进，但一个自然的分类，或至少一个自然的排列，还是可能的。参阅图解就可理解这一点；从A到L可以代表志留纪时期的十一个属，其中有些已经产生出变异后代的大群。可设想十一个属及其始祖的每一个中间环节，其后代的每一支和亚支的中间环节现今依然存在，且这些环节与最细微变种之间的环节一样细微。在这种情形下，就不可能下一定义，把各个群成员与它们更加直接的祖先分开，把这些祖先与其古代未知祖先分开。可是图解上的排列还是有效的；根据遗传原理，凡是从A或者I传下来的一切类型，都会有某些共同点。在一棵树上能够明确这一枝和那一枝，虽然在实际的分杈上，那两枝是连合的，融合在一起。我说过，我们无法定义各个群；却能选出代表每一大群、小群大多数性状的模式或类型，这样就概括了它们之间的差异值。若要成功搜集曾在全部时空生活过的任一纲的全部类型，这就是必须依据的方法。当然，我们永远完不成这样完全的搜集，不过，在某些纲里正在向着这个目标进行；爱德华兹最近一篇力作强调了采用模式的高度重要性，不管能不能把这些模式所隶属的群彼此分开定义。

最后，我们已看到随着生存斗争而来的、几乎无可避免地在一个优势亲种的许多后代中导致灭绝和性状分歧的自然选择，解释了一切生物的亲缘关系中那个巨大而普遍的特点，即群之下还有群。我们用血统这个要素把两性的个体和各龄的个体分类在一个物种之下，虽然它们只有少数性状是共同的，我们用血统对已知的变种进行分类，不管它们与亲体有多大的不同；我相信血统这个要素就是学者在自然系统这个术语下所寻找的潜在联系纽带。自然系统在已经完善的范围以内，是按照谱系排列的，而共同祖先后代之间的差异等级是由属、科、目等术语来表示的，依据这一概念，就能理解分类学不得不遵循的规则。我们能够理解为什么把某些类似的价值估计得远在其他类似之上；为什么允许用残迹的、无用的器官，或生理上重要性很小的器官；为什么在比较一个群与另一个群时立刻排斥同功的或适应的性状，却在同一群的范围内又启用这些性状。我们能够清楚地看到一切现存类型和灭绝类型如何能够归入一个大系统；每一纲的各个成员又怎样由最复杂的辐射状亲缘关系线联结在一起。大概永远不会解开任何一个纲的成员之间错综的亲缘关系网；但是，如果心目中有一个明确的目标，而且不去祈求某种未知的创造计划，我们就可以希望得到稳扎稳打步步为营的进步。




形态学。——我们看到同一纲的成员不论生活习性怎样，在一般体制设计上是彼此相类似的。这种类似性常常用“模式的一致”这个术语来表示；或者说同纲不同物种的若干部分和器官是同源的。整个课题可以包括在形态学这一总称之内。这是博物学中最有趣的部门，而且几乎可说就是它的灵魂。适于抓握的人手、适于掘土的鼹鼠的前肢、马的腿、海豚的鳍状前肢和蝙蝠的翅膀，都是在同一形式下构成的，而且在相当的位置上具有相似的骨片，有什么能够比这更加奇怪的呢？圣提雷尔曾极力主张同源器官彼此关联的高度重要性；部分的形状和大小可以变化到几乎任何程度，但总是以同一不变的顺序保持联系。比方说，我们从未发现过肱骨和前臂骨，或大腿骨和小腿骨颠倒过位置。因此，同一名称可以用于大不相同的动物的同源的骨。我们在昆虫口器的构造中看到同一伟大的法则：天蛾（sphinx-moth）的极长而螺旋形的喙，蜜蜂或臭虫（bug）的奇异折合的喙，甲虫的巨大的颚，有什么比它们更加彼此不同的呢？——可是用于如此大不相同目的的一切这等器官，是由一个上唇、大颚和两对小颚经过不计其数的变异而形成的。这同一法则也支配着甲壳类的口器和肢的构造。植物的花也是这样。

企图采用功利主义或目的论来解释同一纲成员的这种形式相似性，是最没有希望的。欧文在《四肢的性质》这部最有趣的著作中坦承这种企图的无奈。而按照每一种生物独立创造的通常观点，只能说它是这样的：造物主高兴把各个动植物这样设计建造起来。

按照连续轻微变异的选择学说，解释就简单明了——每一变异都以某种方式对变异了的类型有利，但是又经常由于相关生长影响体制的其他部分。在这种性质的变化中，很少或没有改变原始形式或转换各部分位置的倾向。肢的骨片可以缩短和变扁到任何程度，并且包以厚膜，当作鳍用；有蹼的足可以使所有的骨或某些骨变长到任何程度，同时联结各骨的膜扩大，当作翅膀用；可是所有这些大量变异并不倾向于改变骨架结构或改变各部分的相互联系。设想一切哺乳类的早期祖先，可以叫作原型，具有按照现存的一般形式构造起来的肢，不管用于何种目的，我们将立刻看出全纲动物的肢的同源构造的明晰意义。昆虫的口器也是这样，只要设想其共同祖先具有一个上唇、大颚和两对小颚，而这些部分在形状上可能都很简单就行；于是自然选择便可解释昆虫口器在构造上和机能上的无限多样性。然而，可以想象，由于某些部分的缩小和最后完全萎缩，由于与其他部分的融合，由于其他部分的加倍或倍增（我们知道这些变异都是在可能的范围以内），则器官的一般形式会变得极其隐晦不明，以致终于消失。已经灭绝的巨型海蜥蜴（sea-lizards）的桡足，以及某些吸附性甲壳类的口器，其一般的形式似乎已经因此而部分地隐晦不明了。

本主题另有同样奇异的一个分支，即同一个体不同部分或器官相比较，而不是同一纲不同成员的同一部分相比较。大多数生理学家都认为头骨与一定数目的椎骨的基本部分是同源的——这就是说，在数目上和相互关联上是彼此一致的。前肢和后肢在脊椎动物和关节动物纲各个成员里显然是同源的。比较甲壳类的异常复杂的颚和腿，也看到同样的法则。人人都熟知，花的萼片、花瓣、雄蕊和雌蕊的相互位置及其基本构造，依据花由呈螺旋形排列的变态叶所组成的观点，是可以解释的。由畸形植物常常可以得到一种器官可能转化成另一种的直接证据，并且在花的早期，以及在甲壳类和许多其他动物的早期或胚胎阶段，能够实际看到成熟时期极不相同的器官起初是完全相似的。

按照神造的通常观点，这些是多么不可理解！为什么脑髓包含在一个由数目这样多、形状这样奇怪的骨片所组成的盒子里呢？正如欧文所说，分离的骨片便于哺乳类分娩，但这个利益决不能解释鸟类头颅的同一构造。为什么创造出相似的骨片来形成蝙蝠的翅膀和腿，却用于如此完全不同的目的呢？为什么具有多部分组成的极端复杂口器的甲壳类，结果总是腿比较少？相反的，为什么具有许多腿的甲壳类口器都比较简单呢？为什么每一花朵的萼片、花瓣、雄蕊、雌蕊，虽然适于如此不同的目的，却构成同一形式呢？

依据自然选择的学说，便能满意解答这些问题。脊椎动物中可以看到一系列内部椎骨拥有某些突起和附器，而关节动物中可以看到身体分为一系列的部分，拥有外部附器，显花植物中可以看到一系列连续的螺旋形叶轮。同一部分、器官的无限重复是（正如欧文指出的）一切低级或很少变异的类型的共同特征；所以可以轻易认为脊椎动物的未知祖先具有许多椎骨；关节动物的未知祖先具有许多部分；显花植物的未知祖先具有许多个螺旋形的叶轮。我们以前还看到，多次重复的部分，在数目上、构造上，极其容易发生变异；结果，自然选择在长期连续的变异过程中，很可能会抓住一定量的原始类似性要素，多次重复的，使之适应五花八门的目的。由于全部的变异量会受到微小连续步骤的影响，如果发现这种部分和器官中有一定程度的根本类似性，由强烈的遗传原则所保存，也不足为奇。

在软体动物大纲中，虽然能够阐明不同物种的诸部分是同源的，但可以示明的只有少数的系列同源；这就是说，很少能说出同一个体的某一部分或器官与另一部分或器官是同源的。我们能够理解这个事实，因为在软体动物里，哪怕这一纲的最低级成员里，我们也找不到任何一个部分有这样无限的重复，像动植物界其他大纲里所看到的那样。

博物学者经常谈起头颅是由变形的椎骨形成的；螃蟹的颚是变形的腿；花的雄蕊和雌蕊是变形的叶；但是正如赫胥黎教授所说的，在这种情形里，也许可以更正确地说，头颅和椎骨、颚和腿等等，并不是相互变形而成，而是都从某共同的要素变成的。但是，学者只在比喻的意义上用这种语言；他们根本不是说在生物传承的悠久过程中，任何种类的原始器官——一是椎骨，一是腿——曾经实际上转化成头颅或颚。可是这种变异现象的发生看来非常可信，以致学者们几乎不可避免地要使用含有这种清晰意义的语言。按照我的观点，这种术语可以按字面使用，例如螃蟹的颚，如果确实在长期传承中从真实的腿或者某个简单的附器变形而成，那么其所保持的无数性状大概是通过遗传而保存下来的，这一美妙的事实就可以解释清楚了。




胚胎学。——前面已经偶然提及，个体的某些器官在成体状态中变得大不相同，并且用于不相同目的，在胚胎阶段却完全相似。而且，同一纲里不同物种的胚胎往往是惊人相似的。要证明这一点，没有比阿加西斯提到的情况更好的了：忘记把某脊椎动物胚胎的名称贴上，他就说不出它们属于哺乳类、鸟类还是爬行类了。蛾子、苍蝇、甲壳虫等等的蠕虫形幼虫比成虫更酷似，而幼虫的情况是，胚胎活跃，已经适应于专门的生命方式。胚胎类似的法则有时直到相当迟的年齿还保持着痕迹，例如，同一属以及密切近似属的鸟在第一、二期的羽毛上往往相似；如在鸫群体中看到斑点羽毛。在猫族里，大部分物种在长成时都具有条纹或斑点；狮崽也都有清楚易辨的条纹或斑点。植物中也可以偶然看到这种事，不过为数不多。例如，金雀花（ulex）、荆豆（furze）的初叶以及假叶金合欢属（phyllodineous acacias）的初叶，都像豆科植物的普通叶子，是羽状或分裂状的。

同一纲中大不相同的动物的胚胎在构造上彼此相似的各点，往往与生存条件没有直接关系。比方说，在脊椎动物的胚胎中，鳃裂附近的动脉有一特殊的弧状构造，我们不能设想这与在母体子宫内得到营养的幼小哺乳动物、在巢里孵化出来的鸟卵、在水中的蛙卵所处的相似生活条件有关。我们没有理由相信这样的关系，就像没有理由相信人手、蝙蝠翅膀、海豚的鳍内相似的骨是与相似的生活条件有关。没有人会设想狮崽的条纹或小黑鸫鸟的斑点对于这些动物有任何用处，或者与它们所处的条件相关。

可是，在胚胎生涯的任何阶段，如果动物是活动的，而且必须自己找食，情形就不同了。活动期可以出现在生命的较早期或较晚期；但不管在什么时期，幼体对于生活条件的适应，与成体动物一样的完善美妙。由于这类专门适应，近似动物幼体或者活动胚胎的相似性有时就大为不明。甚至可以举出这样的例子，即两个物种或两个物种群的幼体彼此之间的差异要大于等于成体父母。可是，在大多数情形下，虽然是活动的幼体，也还或多或少密切地遵循着胚胎相似的共同法则。蔓足类提供了一个这类的良好例子，甚至声名赫赫的居维叶也没有看出藤壶是名副其实的甲壳类；但是只要看一下幼虫，就会准确无误地知道它是甲壳类。蔓足类的两个主要部分，即有柄蔓足类和无柄蔓足类也是这样，虽然在外表上大不相同，可是它们的幼虫在所有阶段中却很少有区别。

胚胎在发育过程中，体制也一般有所提高；虽然知道几乎不可能清晰定义什么是体制的高低，我还要使用这个说法。大概没有人会反对蝴蝶比毛虫更为高级，可是，在某些情形里，成体动物在等级上一般被认为低于幼虫，如某些寄生的甲壳类就是如此。再来谈一谈蔓足类：第一阶段的幼虫有三对运动器官，一个简单的单眼和一个吻状嘴，用嘴大量捕食，因为体量要大大增加。在第二阶段，相当于蝶类的蛹期，它们有六对构造精致的游泳腿，一对巨大的复眼和极端复杂的触角；但是都有一张闭合而不完全的嘴，不能吃东西；其这一阶段的功能是用很发达的感觉器官去寻找，用活泼的游泳能力去到达适宜的地点，以便附着在上面，进行最后的变态。变态完成之后，它们便永远定居不移动了：于是腿转化成把握器官；重新得到一张结构很好的嘴；但是触角没有了，两只眼也转化成细小的、单独的、简单的眼点。在这最后完成的状态中，把蔓足类看作比幼虫状态体制高或低均可。但是在某些属里，幼虫可以发育成具有一般构造的雌雄同体，也可以发育成我所谓的补雄体（complemental males）；后者的发育确实是退步了，因为这种雄体只是一个短寿的囊，除了生殖器官还在，缺少嘴、胃和其他重要器官。

我们极其惯常地看到胚胎与成体之间的构造差异，以及同一纲大不相同动物胚胎的密切相似，所以容易把这种事实看作必然取决于生长。但是，例如，关于蝙蝠翅膀或海豚的鳍，在胚胎的任何构造可以看出时，为什么所有部分不按照适当的比例显现轮廓，是没有什么明显理由的。在某些整个动物群以及其他群的某些成员中，胚胎不管在哪一时期都与成体没多大差异：例如欧文曾就乌贼的情形指出，“没有变态；头足类的性状远在胚胎各部分发育完成以前就显示出来了”。还有，蜘蛛“没有值得称为变态的东西”。昆虫的幼虫都要经过蠕虫状的发育阶段，不管是活动的和适应于各种不同习性的，还是因处于适宜的养料之中或受到亲体的哺育而不活动的；但是在少数情形里，例如蚜虫，注意一下赫胥黎教授关于这种昆虫发育的画作，就看不到蠕虫状阶段的痕迹。

那么，怎么解释胚胎学的这几个事实呢？——胚胎和成体之间构造上虽然具有不普遍却很一般的差异；——同一个体胚胎的各部分最后变得很不相同并用于不同目的，但在生长早期却是相似的；——同一纲里不同物种的胚胎通常是类似的，但不必普遍如此；——胚胎的构造与生存条件并不密切相关，除非在任何生命时期变得活动，需要自己觅食；——胚胎在体制上有时候高于发育的成体。我相信根据变异传承的观点，对于所有这些可做如下的解释。

也许因为畸形在很早期影响胚胎，所以常常假定轻微的变异也必定在同等的早期内出现。但这方面没有证据——证据却都指向反面；大家都知道，牛、马和各种玩赏动物的饲育者在动物出生初期无法确定将有什么优点或形体。我们对于自己的孩子也清楚地看到这一点；不能总是说出孩子将来是高是矮，容貌什么样。问题不在于变异在生命的什么时期引起，而在于它什么时期充分表现出来。引起变异的原因甚至可以在胚胎形成前发生作用，并且我相信一般就在之前；变异可以是由于雌雄生殖器受到一方亲体或者其祖先所接触的条件的影响。然而，这样引起的影响在很早期，甚至在胚胎形成前发生，却可能在生命的后期出现；就像遗传病只有在晚年出现，却是从亲体的生殖器传染给后代的。还有，就像杂交牛的角受到一方亲体牛角形状的影响一样。只要很幼小的动物还留存在母体的子宫内或卵内，只要受到亲体的营养和保护，那么大部分性状无论是在生命早期或晚期获得的，对于它的利益肯定都无关紧要。例如，对于借长喙之利取食的鸟，只要由亲体哺育，无论幼小时是否具有这种长喙，是无关紧要的。所以我就此下结论，每个物种借以获得当前构造的许多连续变异，可能都发生在并不很早的时期；家养动物有一些直接证据就支持这种观点。可是在其他情形下，所有连续变异，或者其大多数，可能在极早的时期就出现了。

第一章曾经说过，有证据表明，任何变异不论在什么年龄首先出现于亲代，很可能倾向于在后代的相应年龄重新出现。某些变异只能在相应年龄出现。例如，蚕蛾幼虫、茧或蛹体态的特点，牛角在充分长成时的特点。更有甚者，就我们所知，还有无论是生命的早期或晚期出现的变异，倾向于在后代和亲代的相应年龄出现。绝不是说屡试不爽，我能举出变异（取其最广义）的许多例子，发生在子代的时期比亲代早。

这两个原理若得到承认，我认为可能解释上述胚胎学的全部主要事实。但是首先在家养变种中看一看几个相似的事实。某些作者曾写论文研究狗，主张长驱跑狗和喇叭狗虽然外貌如此不同，实际上是密切近似的变种，也许都是从同一个野生种传下来的；因此我极想知道它们的幼崽有多大差异：饲养者告诉我，幼崽之间的差异和亲代之间的差异完全一样，根据目测判断，这似乎是对的；但实际测量老狗和六日龄幼狗，我发现幼狗并没有获得比例差异的全量。还有，有人告诉我拉车马和赛马的马驹之间的差异与充分成长的马一样；我大吃一惊，因为我认为两个品种的差别也许是完全在家养状况下由选择引起的；但是把赛马和重型拉车马的母马和三日龄小马仔细测量之后，我发现小马并没有获得比例差异的全量。

我觉得有确实的证据证明，家鸽的各个品种是从单一野生种传下来的，所以对孵化后十二小时以内的各种雏鸽进行了比较；我对野生的亲种突胸鸽、扇尾鸽、侏儒鸽、巴巴里鸽、龙鸽、瘤鼻鸽、翻飞鸽，仔细测量了（这里不拟举出细节）喙的比例、嘴的宽度、鼻孔和眼睑的长度、脚的大小和腿的长度。这些鸽子中，有一些成熟时在喙的长度和形状上特别不同，如果见于自然状况下，无疑会被列为不同的属。但是把这几个品种的雏鸟排成一列时，虽然大多数能够区别开，可是在上述各要点上的比例差异比起成熟的鸟却是无比地小了。差异的某些特点，例如嘴的宽度，雏鸟中几乎无法察觉。但是这一规律有一个显著的例外，短面翻飞鸽的雏鸟几乎具有成熟状态时完全一样的比例，而与野生岩鸽等品种的雏鸟不同。

依我看，上述两个原理可以解释家养变种后胚胎期的这些事实。饲养者们在马、狗、鸽等近乎成熟的时期选择繁育，并不在乎所需要的品质和构造是生命早期还是晚期获得的，只要成熟动物能具有就可以了。刚才所举的例子，特别是鸽子，似乎阐明了人工选择所累积起来而且给予各品种以价值的那些表现特征差异，一般并不首次出现在生命的很早期，而且后代也是在相应的非早期遗传的。但是短面翻飞鸽的例子，即刚降生十二小时就具有适当的比例，证明这不是普遍的规律。因为这里表现特征差异要么必须早于正常出现，要么必须不是在相应的龄期遗传的，而是早期遗传的。

现在让我们应用这些事实和上述两个原理来说明自然状况下的物种。后一个原理虽然没有证明，但好歹还是有可能的。让我们讨论一下鸟类的一个属，按照我的理论是从某一亲种传下来的，并且有若干新物种通过自然选择为适应不同的习性而发生了变异。于是，由于许多轻微、连续的变异并不是在很早的龄期发生的，且是在相应的龄期得到遗传的，所以假设属的新物种幼体之间的相似显然倾向于远比成体更加密切，正如鸽的个案中所看到的那样。可以把这观点引申到整个的科乃至纲。例如，祖先曾经当作腿用的前肢，可以在悠久的变异过程中，在某一后代中变得适应于当作手，在另一个后代中当作蹼，还有当作翅膀的。但是按照上述两个原理，连续的变异在比较晚的龄期发生，而且是在相应的晚龄期得到遗传的，前肢在亲种几个后代的胚胎中仍然会密切相似，因为还没有变异。但在每一个新物种里，胚胎的前肢会与成熟动物的前肢差异很大，后者的四肢在生命的后期发生了大量变异，因此转化为了手、蹼、翅膀。不管长久连续的使用不使用在改变器官中可以发生什么样的影响，主要是在成熟动物达到全部活动力量，不得不自己谋生时，才对它发生作用。这样产生的效果将在相应的成熟龄期传递给后代。而幼体由于使用或不使用的效果，将不变化或很少变化。

对某些个案，连续变异可以在生命的极早期发生，或者诸级变异可以在比初现时更早的龄期得到遗传，原因在我们则一无所知。不管哪种情形，如短面翻飞鸽那样，幼体或胚胎就密切地类似成熟的亲类型。在某些整个群中，如乌贼、蜘蛛类，以及昆虫这一大纲的某些成员，如蚜虫，我们发现这是发育的规律。关于这些个案的幼体不经过任何变态或者出生时就密切类似亲体的终极原因，我们能够看到这来自以下的两个偶发情况；第一，由于幼体在历经多个世代的变异过程，必须在发育初期解决自己的需要；第二，由于它们亦步亦趋地遵循亲代生活习性；因为在这种情况下，子代须按照亲代的同样方式在幼年发生变异，依据其相似的习性，这对于物种的生存是不可缺少的。然而，也许有必要进一步解释胚胎不经过任何变形的情况。另一方面，如果幼体遵循稍微不同于亲体的生活习性，因而其构造也稍微不同，而从中获益的话，那么，按照相应年龄的遗传原理，活动幼体或幼虫可想而知会因自然选择而轻易变得与亲体不同。这种差异也可以与连续的发育阶段相关；于是，第一阶段幼虫可以与第二阶段大不相同，蔓足类动物就是这样。成体也可以变得适合于地点和习性，即运动器官或感觉器官等在那里都成为无用的了；在这种情形下，可以说终极变态就是退化了。

因为地球上一切生存过的生物，无论灭绝的和现代的，都得归入几个大纲里；统统都被极微细的级进连在一起，如果采集近乎完全，那么最好，乃至唯一可能的排列大概就是依据谱系。血统传承依我看是学者们在自然系统的术语下所寻求的隐性联系纽带。按照这个观点，便能理解，在大多数学者眼里为什么胚胎的构造在分类学上甚至比成体更重要。胚胎是处于较少变异状态的动物，所以揭示了祖先的构造。在动物的两个群中，不管构造和习性现在彼此有多大差异，如果经过相同或相似的胚胎阶段，就可以确定它们都是从同一个或者近似的亲体传承下来的，因而彼此是好歹有密切关系的。这样，胚胎构造中的共同性便暴露了血统的共同性。不管成体的构造发生了多大的变异和模糊，这种血统的共同性还会被揭示出来。例如，我们看到蔓足类，根据幼虫就立刻可以认出是属于甲壳类这一大纲的。每个物种和物种群的胚胎状态部分地表明其变异较少的古代祖先的构造，所以我们能够清楚地了解为什么古代灭绝的类型会和其后代，即现存物种的胚胎相类似。阿加西斯认为这是自然界的法则；但我不得不坦言，我只有期望此后看到这条法则被证明是对的。只有在以下的情形它才能被证明是对的，即现在假设在许多胚胎中得到代表的古代状态并非由于在出生之初发生长期连续的变异，也非由于变异早于它们初现的较早龄期被遗传而全部湮没。还必须记住，古代类型像现代类型的胚胎阶段这条假设法则可能是对的，但是由于地质记录在时间上追溯得还不够久远，它可能长期地或永远地得不到实证。

这样，依我看来，博物学上无比重要的这些胚胎学主要事实，按照以下的原理就可以得到解释，就是某一古代祖先的许多后代中的轻微变异，并非出现在生命的很早时期，尽管可能在最初时就引起了，并且在相应的非早时期得到遗传。如果把胚胎看作一幅图画，虽然多少有些模糊，却反映了每一大纲动物的共同亲类型，那么胚胎学的重要性就大大地提高了。




残迹的、萎缩的和不发育的器官。——处于这种奇异状态中的器官或部分，带着废弃不用的鲜明印记，在整个自然界中极为常见。例如哺乳类的雄体一般具有退化的奶头；我看鸟类“小翼羽”（bastard-wing）可以稳妥地认为是残迹状态的指头；大批蛇类的肺有一叶是残迹；还有的蛇有骨盆和后肢的残迹。某些残迹器官的个案极端怪异。例如，鲸鱼胎儿有牙齿，而成长后头颅里却没有一颗牙齿；未出生小牛的上颚生有牙齿，可是从来不穿出牙龈。甚至有权威人士说，牙齿残迹可以在某些鸟儿胚胎的喙中检测到。翅膀的形成是为了飞行，没有什么比这更加清楚了，可是有多少昆虫，我们看到翅膀小之又小，根本不能用于飞翔，藏在翅鞘里的也不在少数，牢固地联结在一起！

残迹器官的意义往往是明确无误的。例如同一属甚至同一物种的甲虫，在各方面都彼此密切相似，却有一种具有完全的翅，而另一种只具有残迹的膜；在这里，不可能怀疑残迹物就是代表翅的。残迹器官有时还保持着潜在能力，只是没有发育：这似乎见于雄性哺乳类的奶头，记录在案的个案很多，成年雄性的奶头发育得很好，而且分泌乳汁。黄牛属（Bos）的乳房也是如此，正常有四个发达的奶头和两个残迹的奶头；但是在家养的奶牛里这两个有时很发达，而且分泌乳汁。关于植物，同一物种的个体中，花瓣有时是残迹，有时是发达的。在雌雄异花的植物里，雄性花朵往往有雌蕊残迹。科尔路特发现，使这种雄花植物与雌雄同花的物种进行杂交，杂种后代中那残迹雌蕊就大大地增大了；这表明残迹雌蕊和完全雌蕊在性质上是基本相似的。

兼而两用的器官，对于一种用处，甚至比较重要的那种用处，可能变为残迹或完全不发育，而对于另一种用处却完全有效。例如，植物中，雌蕊的功用在于使花粉管达到基部子房里保护的胚珠。雌蕊具有一个柱头，为花柱所支持；但是在某些聚合花科植物中，当然不能受精的雄性小花具有残迹的雌蕊，因为它的顶部没有柱头；但花柱依然很发达，并且照常被有细毛，用来把周围花药里的花粉刷下。还有，一种器官对于固有的用处可能变为残迹的，而被用于不同的目的：在某些鱼类里，鳔对于漂浮的固有机能似乎变为残迹，但是转变成了原始的呼吸器官或肺。还能举出许多相似的事例。

同一物种的诸个体中，残迹器官在发育程度等方面很容易有差别。而且，在密切近似的物种中，同一器官萎缩的程度有时也有很大差异。某些群的雌蛾的翅膀状态很好地例证了这后一事实。残迹器官可能完全退化；这意味着动植物有些器官已踪迹全无，虽然依据类推原希望可以找到它们，而且在畸形个体中可以偶然见到。例如金鱼草（snapdragon，antirrhinum）里一般找不到第五条雄蕊的残迹，但有时候可以看到。在同一纲的不同成员中追踪同一部分的同源作用时，没有比使用和发现残迹物更为常见，或者更为必要了。欧文所绘的马、黄牛和犀牛的腿骨图很好地示明了这一点。

重要的事实在于，残迹器官，如鲸鱼和反刍类上颚的牙齿，往往见于胚胎，后又完全消失。我相信，这也是一条普遍的法则，即残迹部分或器官相对于相邻器官来说，在胚胎里比成体里要大一些；所以这种器官早期的残迹状态不显著，甚至都不能说是残迹的。因此，成体的残迹器官往往说成还保留着胚胎状态。

刚才我已举出有关残迹器官的一些主要事实。仔细思量时，人人都会感到惊奇：告诉我们大多数部分和器官巧妙地适应于某种用处的同一推理能力，也同等明晰地告诉我们这些残迹或萎缩的器官是不完全的，无用的。博物学著作中一般把残迹器官说成是“为了对称的缘故”，或者是为了要“完成自然的计划”而创造。但我觉得这并不是解释，而只是事实的复述。如果说卫星为了对称的缘故，为了完成自然的计划而循着椭圆形轨道绕行星公转，因为行星是这样绕着太阳运行的，别人会以为足够了吗？有一位生理学家假设残迹器官是用来排除过剩的或对于系统有害的物质的，用来解释其存在；但是能假设往往代表雄花中的雌蕊并且只由细胞组织组成那微小乳头（papilla）可以发生这样作用吗？我们能假设以后被吸收的残迹牙齿形成通过排泄珍贵的磷酸钙可以对迅速生长的牛胚胎有所助益吗？人的指头被截断时，断指上有时会出现不完全的指甲：要我相信这些指甲的残迹是为了排泄角质而出现的，而不是出于未知的生长定律，还不如相信海牛鳍上的残迹指甲也是为了这个目的而形成的呢。

按照我关于变异传承的观点，残迹器官的起源是比较简单的。家养生物中有大量残迹器官的例子，——如无尾绵羊品种的尾的残迹，——无耳绵羊品种的耳的残迹，——无角牛的品种，据尤亚特说，特别是小牛的下垂小角的重现，——以及花椰菜（cauliflower）的完全花的状态。畸形生物中常常看到各种部分的残迹。但是我怀疑任何这种例子除了示明残迹器官能够产生出来以外，是否能够说明自然状况下的残迹器官的起源；因为我怀疑自然状况下的物种是否发生突变。我认为不使用是主要推手。它在连续的世代中导致各种器官的逐渐缩小，直到成为残迹，——像暗洞里栖息的动物的眼睛，栖息在海洋岛上的鸟类翅膀，很少被迫起飞，最后失去了飞行能力。还有，器官在某种条件下是有用的，在其他条件下可能是有害的，例如栖息在开阔小岛上的甲虫的翅膀就是这样；在这种情形下，自然选择将会缓慢连续地缩小那种器官，直到它成为无害的残迹器官。

机能上的任何变化，能够由不知不觉的细小步骤完成的，都在自然选择的势力范围之内；所以器官因生活习性变化而对某一目的成为无用或有害时，可以轻易改变而用于另一目的。器官还可以只保存以前的机能之一。器官变成无用时，可发生很多变异，因为其变异不受自然选择的抑制。不管生命的哪一个时期，弃用或选择可使器官缩小，这一般都发生在生物到达成熟期而势必发挥其全部活动力量的时候，而在相应年龄发生作用的遗传原理就使缩小状态的器官在同一年龄重现，于是对于胚胎状态的器官却很少发生影响或者缩小它。这样就能理解，胚胎内的残迹器官比较大，而在成体中就比较小。可是，假如缩小过程的每一步不是在相应年龄遗传，而是在生命的极端初期（有充足理由相信有此可能），残迹部分就倾向于完全失去，于是出现彻底退化的情况。还有前文解释过的节约原则可能会发挥作用，即组成任何部分或构造的材料如果对所有者没有用处，就要尽可能节省。而这倾向于造成残迹器官的完全消失。

因此，残迹器官的存在是由体制中长期存在的各部分的遗传倾向造成的，——根据分类学谱系观点，就能理解分类学者为什么发现残迹器官与生理上高度重要的器官同等地有用，乃至更加有用了。残迹器官可以比作单词中的字母，在发音上已无用，而在拼写上仍保留，还可以用作词源派生的线索。可以断言，残迹的、不完全的、无用的或者退化器官的存在对于通常的生物特创说来说，必定是个怪异难点，但根据变异传承的观点，这不仅不是难点，甚至是可以预料到的，可以由遗传法则加以解释。




提要。——这一章试图表明，古往今来，一切生物群下有群；一切现存生物和灭绝生物由复杂的、放射状的、曲折的亲缘线联结成为一个大系统，这种关系的性质；学者在分类学中所遵循的法则和遇到的困难；性状如果是稳定的、广泛的，就给予价值，不管重要性是大是微，或像残迹器官那样毫无重要性；同功的即适应的性状和具有真实亲缘关系的性状之间在价值上广泛对立；其他这类法则；——学者心目中的近似类型拥有共同的祖先，并且通过自然选择而变异，因而有灭绝以及性状分歧的可能性，按照这个观点，上述所有法则就是自然而然的了。考虑这种分类学观点时，应该记住血统传承因素被普遍用来把同一物种的性别、龄期以及公认变种分类在一起，不管构造上有多大不同。如果把血统这一因素以生物相似的唯一确知原因扩大使用，即可理解什么叫作自然系统：它是力图按谱系进行排列，用变种、物种、属、科、目和纲等术语来表示所获得的差异诸级。

根据同样的变异传承学说，形态学中的全部大事就一目了然，——无论观察同一纲的不同物种在不管有什么用处的同源器官中所表现的同形；还是观察同一动植物个体中同形式构造的同源部分。

根据连续微小的变异不一定或一般不在生命的初期发生并且在相应时期遗传的这一原理，就能理解胚胎学中的主要事实；即成熟时构造和机能上变得大不相同的同源器官在个体胚胎中是类似的；同纲不同种的同源部分或器官是类似的，虽然在成体中适合于尽可能不同的目的。幼虫是活动的胚胎，通过变异在相应的龄期遗传下去的原理，随着生活习性的变化而发生了特殊的变异。根据这同样的原理——并且记住，器官由于不使用或自然选择的缩小，一般发生在生物必须解决自己需要的生命时期，同时还要记住，遗传原则是多么强大，——那么，残迹器官的发生及其最终退化，就没有无法解释的困难了，相反，其存在甚至是可以预期的。根据自然的分类必须按照谱系的观点，就可理解胚胎的性状和残迹器官在分类学中的重要性。

最后，本章讨论的若干类事实，依我看来，清楚地宣布，这个世界上的无数物种、属和科，在各自的纲或群的范围之内，都是从共同祖先传下来的，并且都在传承进程中发生了变异，即使没有其他事实或论证的支持，我也会毫不犹豫地坚持这个观点。





第十四章　回顾与结论


对自然选择学说难点的复述——支持自然选择学说的一般和特殊情况的复述——一般相信物种不变的原因——自然选择学说可以引申到什么程度——自然选择学说的采用对于博物学研究的影响——结束语

因为全书是一篇绵长的争论，所以把主要的事实和推论简略复述一遍，可能给予读者一些方便。

我不否认，有许多严重的异议可以提出来反对通过自然选择的变异传承学说。我努力全盘接受异议。比较复杂的器官和本能的完善并不依靠优于、等于人类理性的方法，而是依靠对于个体所有者有利的无数轻微变异的积累，初看没有比这更难以置信的了。然而，虽然在我们想象中这好像是不可克服的大难点，可是如果承认下述命题，这就不是真实的难点：任何器官或本能的级进完善，不管是现在存在的还是可能存在的，可以认为对于它的种类都是有利的，——全部器官和本能都有极轻微程度的变异——最后，生存斗争导致构造、本能上有利偏差的保存。这些命题的正确性，我想是无可争辩的。

毫无疑问，甚至猜想一下许多构造是通过什么样的中间级进而完善的，也有极端困难，特别对于已经不连续的、衰败的生物群来说，更加如此；但是我们看到自然界里有那么多奇异的级进，这一点“自然界里没有飞跃”的准则已经宣布了，所以应该慎言任何器官或本能，或者整个生物不可能通过许多级进的步骤而达到现在的状态。必须承认，有特别困难的事例来反对自然选择学说，其中最奇妙的一个就是同一蚁群中有两三种工蚁即不育雌蚁的明确等级；但是，我已经试图阐明这些难点是可以克服的。

物种在第一次杂交时普遍的不育性，与变种在杂交时普遍的能育性形成极其明显的对比，就此提请读者参阅第八章末所提出的事实复述。依我看来，事实决定性地表明这种不育性不是特殊的禀赋，有如两棵树木不能嫁接在一起一样；而只是基于杂交物种生殖系统的体质差异的偶然事件。使同样两个物种进行互交，即一个物种先用做父本，后用做母本，结果出现的大量差异里，可看到上述结论的正确性。

变种杂交的能育性及其混种后代的能育性不能看作是千篇一律的。只要记住，其体质或者生殖系统不可能得到深刻改变，普遍的能育性也就不足为奇了。而且，试验过的变种大多数是在家养状况下产生的；由于家养状况显然倾向于消除不育性，就不该希望又产生不育性。

杂种后代的不育性与物种第一次杂交的不育性大不相同，因为其生殖器的机能或多或少不灵了，而第一次杂交时两方面的器官都是完美无缺的。我们连续地看到，各种各样的生物都由于新的生活条件的轻微变化而扰乱了体质，从而变成某种程度的不育，所以看到杂种有某种程度的不育是不足为奇的，因为其体质由于两种体制的结合简直不可能不被扰乱。这种平行现象得到另一批平行而截然相反的事实的支持；即一切生物的活力和能育性由于生活条件的轻微变化而增加，而轻微变异类型或者变种的后代通过杂交会增加活力和能育性。所以，一方面生活条件的大变和大事变异的类型之间杂交，减少了能育性；另一方面，生活条件的小变和小变异的类型之间杂交，增加了能育性。

就地理分布而言，变异传承学说所遭遇的难点颇为严重。同一物种的一切个体、同一属或甚至更高级的群的一切物种都是从共同的祖先传下来的；因此，现在不管在地球上怎样遥远和隔离的地点发现，它们一定是在连续世代的过程中从某一地点迁徙到一切其他地点的。这是怎样发生的，往往连猜测也完全不可能。然而，既然有理由相信，某些物种曾经在极长的时间保持同一物种的类型（如以年代来计算是极其长久的），就不应过分强调同一物种的偶然的广泛散布；因为在很长久的时期里总有良好的机会通过许多方法来进行广泛迁徙的。不连续或中断的分布常常可以由物种在中间地带的灭绝来解释。不能否认，我们对于在现代时期内曾经影响地球的各种气候变化和地理变化的全部范围还是很无知的；而这些变化则往往有利于迁徙。作为一个例证，我曾经企图示明冰期对于同一物种和代表性物种在地球上的分布的影响曾是如何有效。我们对于许多偶然的输送方法还是极无知的。至于生活在遥远而隔离地区的同属不同物种，因为变异的过程必然是缓慢的，所以迁徙的一切方法在很长的时期里便成为可能；结果同属物种广泛散布的难点就在一定程度上减小了。

按照自然选择学说，一定有无数的中间类型曾经存在过，以微细的级进把每一群中的一切物种联结在一起，就像现存变种那样，因此可以问：为什么周围没有看到这些联结类型呢？为什么所有生物并没有混杂成不能分解的混沌状态呢？关于现存的类型，应该记住我们没有权利去希望（极少的例子除外）在它们之间发现直接联结的环节，只能在各个现存类型和某一灭绝、淘汰掉的类型之间发现这种环节。如果一个广阔的地区在长久时期内保持了连续的状态，并且其气候等生活条件从某一物种所占有的区域不知不觉地变化到为一个密切近似物种所占有的区域，即使如此，也没有正当的权利去希望中间地带常常找到中间变种。因为有理由相信，任何时期每一属中只有少数物种发生变化；而且一切变异都是逐渐完成的。我还阐明，起初也许在中间地带存在的中间变种，容易被任何方面的近似类型所淘汰；因为后者由于生存的数目较大，比起数目少的中间变种一般能以较快的速率发生变化和改进；结果中间变种长远看就要被淘汰和消灭掉。

世界上现存生物和灭绝生物之间以及各个连续时期内灭绝物种和更加古老物种之间，都有无数联结的环节已经灭绝。按照这一学说来看，为什么在每一地质层中没有填满这等环节呢？为什么化石遗物的每一次采集没有为生物类型的级进和变化提供明证呢？但是并没有这种证据啊，而这是反对我的理论的许多异议中最明显有力的异议。还有，为什么整群的近似物种好像是突然出现在地质诸阶段之中呢？（虽然这常常是一种假象。）为什么志留纪之下没有发现巨大的地层含有志留纪化石群的祖先遗骸呢？因为，按照我的理论，这样的地层一定在世界历史这古老而完全蒙昧的时代里已经沉积于某处了。

我只能根据地质记录比大多数地质学家所认为的更不完全这一假设来回答上述问题和严重异议。毋庸置疑，进行任何数量的生物变化，记录在案的时间是不够的；亘古以来的时间之长，绝非人类智力所能把握。全部博物馆内的标本数目与肯定生存过的无数物种的无数世代比较起来，是完全不足道的。即使研究生物是周密进行的，除非同样得到过去祖先和现在状态之间的许多中间环节，否则无法辨识一个物种是否是一个或多个物种的祖先；而由于地质记录不完全，我们也无希望找到这么许多环节。可以举出无数现存的可疑类型，也许是变种呢；但是谁敢说将来会发现众多的化石环节，让学者能够按照通行的观点决定这些可疑类型是否应该叫作变种？只要任何两个物种间的大部分环节未知，若发现任何一个环节或中间变种，就会干脆被列为另一个物种的。只有世界的一小部分曾经过地质勘探。只有某些纲的生物才能在化石状态中至少以任何大量的数目保存下来。分布广的物种最常变异，变种起初又常是地方性的——由于这两个原因，要发现中间环节就更不可能。地方变种不等到相当的变异改进之后，是不会分布到遥远地区的；等散布开了，并且在一个地层中被发现的时候，就好像是在那里被突然创造出来似的，于是就干脆列为新物种。大多数地层在沉积中是断断续续的，我相信，延续的时间大概比物种类型的平均延续时间更短。连续的地质层都被长久的空白间隔时间所分开；因为含有化石的地质层，其厚度足以抵抗未来的陵蚀作用，只能在海底下降而有大量沉积物沉积的地方，才能得到堆积。在水平面上升和静止的交替时期，地质记录是空白的。在后面这样的时期中，生物类型大概会有更多的变异性；在下降的时期，大概有更多的灭绝。

关于志留纪地质层以下缺乏富含化石的地层一点，我只能回到第九章提出的假说。地质记录不完整，大家都承认；但不完整到我要求的程度，很少人会承认。如果我们观察到足够悠长的间隔时间，地质学说就明白地宣告一切物种都变化了，而且是以我的理论所要求的方式发生变化，因为都是缓慢且以渐进方式变化的。我们在连续地质层里的化石遗骸中清楚地看到这种情形，它们的彼此关系一定远比时间相隔很远的地质层中的化石更加密切。

以上就是可以正当提出来反对我的理论的几种主要异议和难点的概要；我现在简要地复述了针对性的回答和解释。多年来我一直感到这些难点沉甸甸的，不怀疑它们的分量。但值得特别注意的是，更加重要的异议与我们坦白无知的那些问题有关；而且我们还不知道自己无知到什么程度。我们还不知道在最简单和最完善器官之间一切可能的过渡级进；也不能假装已经知道，悠久岁月里各种各样的分布方法，或者地质记录是怎样的不完全。尽管这几种难点是严重的，但在我的判断中，决不足以推翻变异传承学说。

现在让我们谈谈争论的另一面。在家养状况下可看到大量变异性。似乎主要是由于生殖系统尤其易于受生活条件变化的影响；所以这个生殖系统在没有变成无能的时候，不能繁殖跟亲类型一模一样的后代。变异性受许多复杂的法则支配——被相关生长、使用不使用，以及周围条件的直接作用所支配。要确定家养生物曾经发生过多少变异，难度很大；但是可以稳妥地推论，变异量是大的，而且变异能够长久地遗传下去。只要生活条件保持不变，就有理由相信，曾经遗传过许多世代的变异可以继续遗传几乎无限的世代。另一方面，有证据说，变异性一旦发生作用，就不会全部停止；即使最古老的家养生物也会偶尔产生新变种。

变异性实际上不是由人引起的；人只是无意识地把生物放在新的生活条件下，于是自然就对生物的体制发生作用，而引起变异。但是人能够并且确实选择了自然给予的变异，从而把变异按照任何需要的方式累积起来。这样，人可以使动植物适应自己的利益或爱好。可以有计划地或者无意识地这样做，就是保存当时对自己最有用的个体，但没有改变品种的任何企图。人肯定能借着在每一连续世代中选择那些非有训练的眼睛就不能辨识出来的极其微细的个体差异，来大大影响品种的性状。这种选择过程在形成最显著最有用的家养品种中起过重大作用。人所产生的许多品种在很大程度上具有自然物种的性状，这已由许多品种究竟是变种还是本土物种这一难解的疑问所示明了。

没有明显理由表明，家养状况下曾经如此有效地发生了作用的原理，为什么不能在自然状况下起作用。在不断反复的“生存斗争”中，受惠的个体或族得到生存，从中我们可以看到最强有力和经常发生作用的选择手段。一切生物都依照几何级数高速率增加，必然会引起生存斗争。这种高增加率可用计算来证明，连续的特殊季节，以及在新区归化都会产生这种效果，详见第三章。产生出来的个体比可能生存的多。天平上的些微之差便可决定个体的生死存亡，——哪些变种或物种将增量，哪些将减量或最后灭绝。同一物种的个体彼此在各方面进行最密切的竞争，因此之间的斗争一般最为剧烈；同一物种的变种之间，斗争几乎也是同样剧烈，其次就是同属的物种之间；另一方面，在自然系统上相距很远的生物之间，斗争也常常是剧烈的。某些个体在任何年龄或任何季节比与其相竞争的个体只要占有最轻微的优势，或者对周围物理条件具有任何轻微程度的较好适应，结果就会改变平衡。

对于雌雄异体的动物，在大多数情形下雄者之间为了占有雌者，就会发生斗争。最强有力的雄者，或与生活条件斗争最成功的雄者，一般会留下最多的后代。但是成功往往取决于雄者具有特别武器，或者防御手段，或者魅力；轻微的优势就会导致胜利。

地质学清楚地表明，各个陆地都曾发生过巨大的物理变化，因此，可以预料生物在自然状况下曾经变异，有如在家养状况下普遍发生变异那样。如果在自然状况下有任何变异性的话，那么要说自然选择不曾发生作用，那就是无法解释的事实了。常常有人主张，变异量在自然状况下是有严格限制的量，但是这个主张是无法证实的。虽然只是作用于外部性状而且往往心血来潮，人类却能够在短暂的时期内由累积家养生物的个体差异而产生巨大的结果；并且人人都承认自然物种至少呈现个体差异。但是，除了个体差异外，所有学者都承认有自然变种存在，认为有足够的区别而值得分类学著作加以记载。没有人可以在个体差异和轻微变种之间，在特征明确的变种和亚种、物种之间划出明显的区别。请注意，学者给予欧洲、北美许多代表性类型的分级是有不同意见的。

倘若自然界存在变异性，而且有强有力的动因随时准备进行选择，我们为什么要怀疑，变异在任何方面有利于生物的，会在极其复杂的生活关系下得到保存、累积和遗传呢？人既能耐心选择对他有用的变异，为什么在变化着的生活条件下有利于自然生物的变异，自然不会加以选择呢？对于这种在悠久年代中发生作用并严格检查每一生物的整个体制、构造和习性——助长好的并排除坏的——的力量能够加以限制吗？对于这种缓慢而美妙地使每一类型适应于最复杂的生活关系的力量，我看是漫无边际的。哪怕我们不看得更远，自然选择学说本身依我看也是可信的。我已经尽可能公正地复述了对方提出的难点和异议，现在转而谈一谈支持这个学说的特殊事实和论点。

物种只是特征强烈显著的、稳定的变种，而且每一物种首先作为变种而存在，根据这一观点，便能理解，在一般假定由特殊创造行为产生出来的物种和公认为由次要法则产生出来的变种之间，为什么没有一条界线可定。根据这同一观点，还能理解在一个属的许多物种曾经产生出来且现今仍为繁盛的地区，为什么同样的物种要呈现许多变种；因为在物种工厂很活跃的地方，一般来说，可以预料还在活跃；如果变种是初始物种，情形就确是这样。还有，大属的物种提供较大数量的变种即初始物种，那么在某种程度上就会保持变种的性状；因为它们之间的差异量比小属物种的差异量为小。大属的密切近似物种显然在分布上要受到限制，并且围绕着其他物种聚成小群——这两方面都和变种相似。根据每一物种都是独立创造的观点，这些关系就是奇特的，但是如果所有物种都是首先作为变种而存在的话，那么这些关系便是可以理解的了。

各个物种都倾向于按几何级数繁殖而过量增加；而且其变异后代由于习性和构造上更加多样化而相应增量，便能在自然组成中攫取许多决然不同的场所，自然选择就不断倾向于保存任一物种分歧最大的后代。所以在长久连续的变异过程中，同一物种的诸变种所特有的轻微差异便趋于增大而成为同一属物种所特有的较大差异。改进了的新变种不可避免地要淘汰消灭掉改进较少的和中间的旧变种；这样，物种在很大程度上就成为确定的、界限分明的了。属于较大群的优势物种倾向于诞生优势的新类型；结果每一大群便倾向于变得更大，同时在性状上更加分歧。但是所有的群不能都这样继续增大，世界容纳不下它们，所以占优势的群体就要打倒较不占优势的群体。这种大群继续增大以及性状继续分歧的倾向，加上几乎不可避免的大量灭绝的可能，说明了一切生物类型都是按照群下有群来排列的，所有这些群都包括在我们周围到处可见、自始至终占有优势的少数大纲之内。把一切生物都归群的这一伟大事实，根据特创说，依我看是完全不能解释的。

自然选择仅能借着轻微的、连续的、有利的、变异的积累而起作用，所以不能产生巨变或突变；只能取短小缓慢的步骤。“自然界里没有飞跃”这一格言已被每次新增加的知识所进一步证实，因此，根据我这个学说，格言就简单明了了。我们能够理解，为什么自然界在多样性上是浪费的，但在创新上是吝啬的。但是如果每一物种都是独立创造，那么，为什么这应当是自然界的法则，就没有人能解了。

依我看，根据我这个学说，还有许多其他事实可以得到解释。这是多么奇怪的创造啊：啄木鸟形态的鸟会在地面上捕食昆虫；少游泳或不游泳的高地鹅具有蹼脚；鸫鸟潜水并吃水中的昆虫；海燕具有适于海雀或生活的习性和构造！如此等等不一而足。但是根据各个物种都不断力求增量，而自然选择总是在使每一物种的缓慢变异着的后代适应于自然界中未被占据或占据得不好的地方的观点，上述事实就不足为奇，甚至是可以预测的了。

自然选择由竞争而起作用，使各地生物得到适应，只是相对于同住者的完善程度而言；所以任何一地的物种，虽然按通常的观点假定是为了那个地区创造出来而特别适应该地的，却被外地移来的归化生物所打倒淘汰，对此我们不必惊奇。如果自然界里的一切设计，就我们所能判断的来说，并不是绝对完善的；如果其中有些与我们的合适观念相反，对此也不必惊奇。蜜蜂的刺，会引起蜜蜂自己的死亡；雄蜂为了一次交配而被产生出那么多，交配之后便被不育的姊妹们杀死；冷杉花粉的惊人浪费；蜂后对于能育的女儿们所具有的本能仇恨；姬蜂在毛虫的活体内求食；诸如此类的例子，也不足为奇。从自然选择学说看来，奇怪的事情实际上倒是未发现更多缺乏绝对完善的例子。

支配产生变种的复杂而未知的法则，就我们所能判断的来说，与支配产生明确物种的法则是相同的。在这两种场合里，物理条件似乎只产生了一点点直接的效果；可当变种进入任何新地点以后，有时便取得该地物种所固有的某些性状。对于变种和物种，使用和不使用似乎产生了一些效果；若看到以下情形，就难以反驳这一结论。例如，翅膀不能飞翔的大头鸭所处的条件几乎与家鸭相同；穴居的栉鼠有时是盲目的，某些鼹鼠通常是盲目的，而且眼睛上被皮肤遮盖着；栖息在美洲和欧洲暗洞里的动物是盲目的。对于变种和物种，相关生长似乎发挥了重要作用。因此，某一部分发生变异时，其他部分也必然要发生。长久亡失的性状有时会在变种和物种中复现。马属的若干物种及其杂种偶尔会在肩上和腿上出现条纹，根据特创说，这一事实将无法解释！如果相信这些物种都是从具有条纹的祖先传下的，就像鸽的若干家养品种都是从具有条纹的蓝色岩鸽传下来的那样，那么上述事实的解释将是何等的简单！

按照每一物种都是独立创造的通常观点，为什么物种的性状，即同属的诸物种彼此相区别的性状比所共有的属的性状更多变异呢？比方说，一个属的任何一种花的颜色，为什么当所谓独立创造的其他物种具有不同颜色的花时，要比一切物种的花都同色时更易发生变异呢？如果说物种只是特征很显著的变种，其性状已经高度稳定了，那这种事实就能理解；因为这些物种从一个共同祖先分支出来以后在某些性状上已经发生变异了，这就是彼此赖以区别的性状；所以这些性状比长期未变遗传下来的属的性状就更易变异。特创说就不能解释在一属的单独一个物种里，以很异常方式发育起来因而可以自然地推想对于该物种有巨大重要性的部分，为什么显著易于变异；但根据我的观点，自从若干物种由一个共同祖先分支出来以后，这部分已经有大量的变异变化，可以预料一般还要发生变异。但如蝙蝠的翅膀，部分可能以最异常的方式发育起来，如果是许多附属类型所共有的，也就是说，如果已经遗传很长时间，就不会比其他构造更容易发生变异；因为在这种情形下，长久连续的自然选择就会使它恒定了。

看一看本能，某些本能虽然很神奇，可是按照连续的、轻微而有益的变异之自然选择学说，它们并不比肉体构造提供更大的难点。这样，便能理解为什么自然在赋予同纲的不同动物以各种本能时，是以级进的步骤进行的。我试图阐明过，级进原理对于蜜蜂美妙的建筑能力提供了多大的启示。在本能的改变中，习性无疑往往起作用；但肯定不是不可缺少的，就像在中性昆虫的情形中所看到的那样，并不留下后代去继承长久连续的习性的效果。根据同属的一切物种都是从共同祖先传下来、遗传了许多共同性状这一观点，便能了解近似物种处在极不相同的条件之下时，怎么还具有几乎同样的本能；为什么南美洲热带和温带的鸫像我英国的物种那样用泥土涂抹巢的内侧。根据本能是通过自然选择缓慢获得的观点，我们对某些本能并不完全、容易犯错，而且许多本能会使其他动物蒙受损失，就不必大惊小怪了。

如果物种只是特征很显著的、稳定的变种，便能立刻看出为什么杂交后代在类似亲体的程度和性质上——连续杂交而相互吸收等等方面——就像公认的变种杂交后代那样遵循同样的复杂法则。如果物种是独立创造的，并且变种是通过次要法则产生出来的，这种类似就成为怪事了。

承认地质记录不完全到极端的程度，地质记录所提供的事实就强有力地支持了变异传承学说。新物种缓慢地在连续的间隔时间内出现；而不同的群经过相等的间隔时间之后的变化量是大不相同的。物种和整个物种群的灭绝，在有机世界的历史中作用非常显著，几乎不可避免地是自然选择原理的结果；因为旧的类型要被改进了的新类型淘汰。单独一个物种也好，整群的物种也罢，普通世代的链条一旦断绝，就不再出现了。优势类型逐渐散布，其后代缓慢变异，使得生物类型经过长久的间隔时间以后，看来好像是在全世界范围内同时发生变化似的。各个地质层的化石遗骸的性状在某种程度上是介于上、下地质层之间的，这一事实可以简单地由它们在传承链中处于中间地位来解释。一切灭绝生物都能与一切现存生物分类在一起，要么同群，要么属于中间群，这一伟大事实是现存生物和灭绝生物都作为共同祖先后代的自然结果。由于物种群从早期祖先传承下来时一般已在性状上发生了分歧，祖先及其早期后代往往在性状上比后期后代处于中间的位置；所以便能理解为什么化石越古，往往就越处于现存的类似群某种程度上的中间。现代类型一般被模糊地看作比古代灭绝类型为高；因为后来的、改进了的类型在生活斗争中战胜了较老的改进较少的生物。最后，同一大陆的近似类型——如澳洲的有袋类、美洲的贫齿类和其他这类例子——长久延续的法则也是可以理解的，因为在同一局促地区里，现存生物和灭绝生物由于传承自然是近似的。

看一看地理分布，如果承认由于以前的气候和地理变化以及许多偶然和未知的散布方法，在悠长的岁月中曾经有过从世界的某一部分到另一部分的大量迁徙，那么根据变异传承学说，便能理解有关分布的大多数主要事实。为什么生物在整个空间内的分布和在整个时间内的地质演替会有这么动人的平行现象；因为在这两种情形里，生物通常都由世代的纽带所联结，而且变异的方法也是一样的。我们体会了想必曾经引起每一个旅行家注意的奇异事实的全部意义，即同一大陆上，在最不相同的条件下，炎热和寒冷下，高山和低地上，在沙漠和沼泽里，每一大纲里的生物大部分是显然相关联的；都是同一祖先和早期移住者的后代嘛。根据以前迁徙的同一原理，在大多数情形里它与变异相结合，借冰期之助，便能理解最遥远的高山上的、最不相同的气候下少数植物的同一性，以及许多其他生物的密切近似性；同样地还能理解虽被整个热带海洋隔开的北温带和南温带海里的某些生物的密切相似性。虽然两个地区呈现同样的生活条件，如果长久时期内是彼此分开的，那么对于其生物的大不相同就不必大惊小怪；因为，由于生物和生物之间的关系是一切关系中最重要的，且这两个地区在不同时期内会从第三个地区或者彼此相互接受不同比例的移住者，地区的生物变异过程就必然是不同的。

依据这个迁徙，外加以后变异的观点，便能理解为什么只有少数物种栖息在海洋岛上，而其中许多物种是特殊类型。我们清楚知道那些不能横渡广阔海面的动物群的物种，如蛙类和陆栖哺乳类为什么不栖息在海洋岛上；另一方面，还可理解，像蝙蝠这些能够横渡海洋的动物，其特殊的新物种为什么往往见于远离大陆的岛上。海洋岛上有蝙蝠的特殊物种存在，却没有所有其他陆栖哺乳类，根据独立创造的学说，这情形就完全无法解释了。

任何两个地区有密切近似的或代表性物种存在，从变异传承学说的观点看，意味着同一亲类型曾经在这两个地区栖息过；并且，无论何地，如果有许多密切近似物种栖息在两个地区，必然还会在那里发现两地共有的某些同一物种。无论何地，如果有许多密切近似的而区别分明的物种发生，那么同一物种的许多可疑类型和变种也会同样在那里发生。各地的生物必与移入者最近根源地的生物有关联，这是具有高度一般性的法则。从加拉帕戈斯群岛、胡安·斐尔南德斯群岛（Juan Fernandez）等美洲岛屿上，几乎所有的动植物与邻近的美洲大陆都有触目惊心的关系，在佛得角群岛等非洲岛屿上，生物与非洲大陆也有关系，就可以看到这一点。必须承认，根据特创说，这些事实是得不到解释的。

我们已经看到，一切过去的和现代的生物构成一个自然大系统，都可群下分群，而且灭绝的群往往介于现代群之间，这一点根据自然选择及其所引起的灭绝和性状分歧的学说，是可以理解的。根据这些同样的原理便能理解，每一纲里的物种和属的相互亲缘关系为何如此复杂和曲折。还能理解，为什么某些性状比其他性状在分类学上更有用；——为什么适应的性状虽对于生物具有高度重要性，在分类学上却几乎无足轻重；为什么从残迹器官而来的性状虽对于生物没用，却往往在分类学上具有高度的价值；还有，胚胎的性状为什么往往是最有价值的。一切生物的真实亲缘关系，可以归因于遗传或传承的共同性。自然系统是一种依照谱系的排列，必须依最恒定的性状去发现传承路线，不管其在生活上多么不重要。

人的手、蝙蝠的翅膀、海豚的鳍和马的腿都由相似的骨骼构成，——长颈鹿颈和象颈的脊椎数目相同，——不计其数的这类事实，依据伴随着缓慢、微小而连续的变异的生物传承学说，立刻可以得到解释。蝙蝠的翅膀和腿，——螃蟹的颚和腿，——花的花瓣、雄蕊和雌蕊，虽然用于极不同的目的，但结构样式都相似。这些器官或部分在各个纲的早期祖先中原来是相似的，但以后逐渐发生了变异。根据这观点，上述的相似性同样可以解释。连续变异不总是在早期年龄中发生，并且它的遗传是在相应的而不是在更早的龄期；依据这一原理可清楚地理解，为什么哺乳类、鸟类、爬行类和鱼类的胚胎会如此密切相似，而在成体类型中又如此不相似。对于呼吸空气的哺乳类或鸟类的胚胎就像必须依靠发达的鳃来呼吸水中溶解空气的鱼类那样具有鳃裂和弧状动脉，不用大惊小怪。

不使用，有时借自然选择之助，往往倾向于使器官在生活习性或生活条件改变时废弃而缩小；根据这一观点便能理解残迹器官的意义。但是不使用和选择一般是在每一生物到达成熟期并且必须在生存斗争中发挥充分作用的时期，才能对每一生物发生作用，所以对于早龄期的器官没有什么影响力；因此器官在这早期不会大幅度缩小或成为残迹。比方说，小牛从具有发达牙齿的早期祖先遗传了牙齿，却从来不穿出上颚牙床；可以相信，由于舌和颚通过自然选择变得非常适于吃草，而无须牙齿的帮助，所以成年动物的牙齿在连续的世代中由于不使用而缩小了；可是在小牛中，牙齿却没有受到选择或不使用的影响，并且依据遗传在相应年龄的原理，从远古期一直遗传至今。带着毫无用处的鲜明印记的部分，例如小牛胚胎的牙齿或许多甲虫的联合鞘翅下的萎缩翅，竟会如此经常发生，根据每一生物以及它的一切不同部分都是特创的观点，这是多么不可理解！可以说自然曾经煞费苦心地利用残迹器官以及同源的构造来泄露其变异计划，只是我们固执不愿意理解而已。

上述事实和论据使我完全相信，物种曾经发生变化，而且仍然在缓慢变化，保存和积累连续的轻微有利变异。对此我已做了复述。试问，为什么所有在世的最卓越博物学者和地质学者都拒绝物种的可变性观点呢？不能主张生物在自然状况下不发生变异；不能证明变异量在悠久年代的过程中是一种有限的量；在物种和特征显著的变种之间未曾有，也不能有清楚的界限。不能主张物种杂交必然是不育的，而变种杂交必然是能育的；不能主张不育性是创造的一种特殊禀赋和标志。只要把地球的历史想成是短暂的，几乎不可避免地就要相信物种是不变的产物；既然对于时间的推移已经有某种概念，就不会无根无据地去假定地质记录已经完美无缺，认为物种若有过变异，地质记录就会向我们提供有关物种变异的明证。

但是，我们天然地不愿意承认一个物种会产生其他不同物种，主要原因在于我们总是迟缓地承认自己不知道中间步骤的任何巨变。这就像那么多地质学者所感到的难点一样，如赖尔最初主张长排内陆岩壁的形成和巨大山谷的凹下都是由海岸波浪的缓慢作用所致。人脑不可能把握亿年之计的全部意义；而经过几乎无限世代累积的许多轻微变异，其全部效果如何更是不能累加领会的了。

虽然我坚信本书在提要形式下提出来的观点是正确的，但并不期望说服富有经验的博物学者，他们的思想装满了大量事实，而对于这些事实，长久以来其观点却与我正好相反。在“创造计划”“统一设计”之类的说法下，我们的无知多么容易被隐藏起来，而且还会拿只复述事实充当解释。无论何人，只要性情偏重尚未解释的难点，而不重视许多事实的解释，就必然要反对我的理论。思维灵活并且已经开始怀疑物种不变性的少数学者，可以受到本书的影响；但是我满怀信心地看着将来，后起之秀的博物学者，将会不偏不倚地看待问题的两个方面。凡是已被引导到相信物种可变的人，如果认认真真表达自己的确信，就做了好事；只有这样，才能把这一问题上铺天盖地的偏见重负移去。

几位卓越的博物学者最近发表己见，认为每一属中都有许多公认的物种并非真实物种；而其他物种才是真实的，就是说，被独立创造出来的。依我看来，这是奇谈怪论。他们承认，许多类型直到最近还自认为是特创的且大多数学者也是这样看，因而具有真实物种的一切外部特征，——他们承认这些类型是由变异产生的，却拒绝把同一观点引申到其他稍微不同的类型。然而，他们并不声称自己能够确定，甚至猜测，哪些是被创造出来的生物类型，哪些是由次要法则产生出来的。他们在某一种情形下承认变异是真实原因，而在另一种情形下却又武断否认，又不指明这两种情形有何区别。总有一天，这会被当作怪例来说明先入之见的盲目性。这些作者对奇迹创造行为并不比对通常的生殖感到更大的惊奇。但是他们是否真的相信，在地球历史的无数时期中，某些元素的原子会突然被命令骤变成活的组织呢？他们相信在每次假定的创造行为中都有一个或多个个体产生出来吗？所有无限多种类的动植物在被创造出来时，究竟是卵或种子，还是充分长成的成体？在哺乳类的情形下，是带着营养的虚假印记从母体子宫内被创造出来的吗？尽管可以正当地要求那些相信物种可变性的人对每一个难点都做出全面解释，但学者们自己方面却忽视物种初次出现的整个问题，所谓敬而远之的沉默。

可以问，我要把物种变异的学说扩展到多远。这个问题是难于回答的，因为所讨论的类型愈是不同，论点的力量就愈小。但是最有力的论点可以扩展到很远。整个纲的一切成员可以由亲缘链联结在一起，都能够按群下分群的同一原理来分类。化石遗骸有时倾向于把现存诸目之间的巨大空隙填充起来。残迹状态下的器官清楚地表明，早期祖先的这种器官是充分发达的；在某些情形里这必然意味着后代已发生过大量变异。在整个纲里，各种构造都是在同一样式下形成的，而且胚胎期的物种彼此密切相似。所以我不能怀疑变异传承学说笼络了同一大纲的一切成员。我相信动物至多是从四五种祖先传下来的，植物是从少于等于四五个的祖先传下来的。

类比法引导我更进一步，认为一切动植物都是从某一种原型传下来的。但类比法可能误导。然而，一切生物在化学成分、生发泡、细胞构造、生长和生殖法则上都有许多共同点。甚至在以下那样不重要的事实里也能看到这一点，即同一毒质常常同样地影响各种动植物；瘿蜂分泌的毒质能引起野蔷薇或橡树产生畸形。我因此以类比法推论，曾经在地球上生活过的一切生物，也许都是从某一原始类型传下来的，它才最初获得了生命。

本书有关物种起源的观点，或者类似的观点，一旦普遍接受，我们就能够隐约地预见到博物学将会发生重大革命。分类学者能和现在一样劳动，但不会再遭这个或那个类型本质上是否为真实物种这一朦胧疑问的不断骚扰。我有把握，这是如释重负；我是经验之谈。近五十个物种的英国树莓类（bramble）是否为真实物种这一无休止的争论将结束。分类学者只消决定（这点并不容易）任何类型是否充分恒定，能否与其他类型有区别，就能下定义了；如果能够下定义，只消决定那些差异是否充分重要，值得给以物种名。后述一点比现在的待遇远为重要；因为任何两个类型的差异不管如何轻微，如果不被中间级进混合在一起，大多数学者会认为这两个类型都足以提升物种的地位。从此以后，将不得不承认物种和特征显著的变种之间的唯一区别是：变种现在由公认或据信被中间级进联结起来，而物种却是以前被这样联结起来的。因此，在不拒绝考虑任何两个类型之间目前存在着中间级进的情况下，我们将被引导着更加仔细地去权衡，更加高度地去评价它们之间的实际差异量。十分可能，现在一般被认为只是变种的类型，今后可能会被认为值得给以物种名，比如报春花属和樱草；在这种情形下，科学语言和百姓语言就一致了。总而言之，必须用学者对待属那样的态度来对待物种，承认属只不过是图方便而做的人为组合。这或者不是令人振奋的展望；但是，对于物种这一术语没有发现的、不可能发现的本质，我们至少不必再做徒劳的探索。

博物学的其他更一般的部门将会大大地引起兴趣。学者所用的术语如亲缘关系、关系、模式的同一性、父性、形态学、适应的性状、残迹和萎缩器官等等，将不再是比喻，而会有明确的意义。当我们不再像未开化人把船看作是完全不可理解的东西那样地来看生物的时候；当我们把自然界的每一产品看成是都具有悠久历史的时候；当我们把每一种复杂的构造和本能看成是各个对于所有者都有用处的设计的综合，就像任何伟大的机械发明是无数工人的劳动、经验、理性甚至错误的综合的时候；当我们这样观察每一生物的时候，博物学的研究将变得——我根据经验来说——有趣得多！

在变异的原因和法则、相关法则、使用和不使用的效果、外界条件的直接作用等等方面，将会开辟一片广大的、几乎未经前人踏过的研究领域。家养生物的研究价值将大大提高。人类培育出来一个新变种，比起在有记载的无数物种中增添一个物种，会成为远远更重要、更有趣的研究课题。分类学将尽可能按谱系进行；那时才能真的显示出所谓创造的计划。当我们看到确定目标时，分类学规则无疑会变得更加简单。我们不拥有谱系或族徽；必须依据各种长久遗传下来的性状去发现和追踪自然谱系中的许多分歧的传承线。残迹器官将会确凿无误地表明长久亡失的构造的性质。称作畸变，又可以富于幻想地称作活化石的物种和物种群，将帮助我们构成一张古代生物类型的图画。胚胎学则会揭露出每一大纲内原始类型的构造，不过多少有点模糊而已。

如果我们能够确定同一物种的所有个体以及大多数属的所有密切近似物种，曾经在不很遥远的时期内从一个祖先传下来，并且从某一诞生地迁移出来；如果更好地知道迁移的许多方法，而且依据地质学现在对于以前的气候变化和地平面变化所提出的见解以及今后继续提出的解释，那么我们就确能以令人赞叹的方式追踪出全世界生物过去的迁移情况。甚至在现在，如果把大陆相对两边海栖生物的差异加以比较，而且把该大陆上各种生物的性质与其看上去的迁移方法加以比较，那么我们就能对古地理状况多少提出一些阐述。

地质学这门高尚的科学，由于地质记录的极端不完全而黯然失色。埋藏着生物遗骸的地壳不能看作充实的博物馆，收藏的只是偶然的、片段的、贫乏的物品而已。每一含有化石的巨大地质层的堆积将被看作可遇不可求，而连续阶段之间的空白间隔是极长久的。但是通过以前和以后的生物类型的比较，就能多少可靠地测出这些间隔的持续时间。我们必须慎用生物类型的一般演替，把两个含有极少相同物种的地质层关联成严格属于同一时期。因为物种的产生和灭绝是由于缓慢发生作用的、现今依然存在的原因，而不是由于创造的奇迹行为和灾变；因为生物变化的一切原因中最重要的是一种几乎与变化的或者突变的物理条件无关的原因，即生物和生物之间的相互关系，——一种生物的改进会引起其他生物的改进或灭绝；所以，连续地质层化石中的生物变化量大概可以作为一种合理尺度来测定实际的时间过程。可是，许多物种在集体中可能长时期保持不变，然而在同一时期里，其中若干物种，由于迁徙到新的地区并与外地的同住者进行竞争，可能发生变异；所以对于把生物变化作为时间尺度的准确性，不得有过高的评价。在地球历史的早期，也许生命类型比较少而简单，变化速度可能比较缓慢；在生命曙光初照时，极少的最简单构造的类型存在，变化速度可能极度缓慢。现在知道的整个世界历史，尽管悠久得无法理解，但与最早的生物创造出来，即不计其数的灭绝和现存后代的祖先以来的世代相比，以后将看作区区的时间片段。

我看到了遥远将来重要得多的广阔研究领域。心理学将建筑在新的基础上，即每一智力和智能都是由级进而必然获得的。人类的起源及其历史也将由此得到说明。

最卓越的作者们对于每一物种曾被独立创造的观点似乎心满意足。依我看来，世界上过去的和现在的生物之产生和灭绝就像决定个体生死的原因一样，是由于次要原因，这与我们所知道的造物主在物质上打下印记的法则更相符合。当我把一切生物不看作是特别的创造物，而看作是远在志留纪第一层沉积很久以前就生活着的某些少数生物的直系后代，依我看来，它们变得尊贵了。以古推今，可以稳妥地设想，没有一个现存物种会把原封不动的外貌传递到遥远的未来。并且现今生活的物种将很少把任何种类的后代传到极遥远的未来；因为依据一切生物分类的方式看来，每一属的大多数物种以及许多属的一切物种都没有留下后代，而是完全灭绝了。展望未来，可以预言，最后胜利并且产生占有优势的新物种，将是较大优势群的普通的、广泛分布的物种。既然一切现存生物类型都是远在志留纪以前生存过的生物的直系后代，便可肯定，通常的世代演替从来没有中断过，而且从来没有任何灾变曾使全世界变成荒芜。因此我们可以多少安心地去眺望一个长久得同样无法把握的、稳定的未来。因为自然选择只是根据并且为了每一生物的利益而工作，所以一切肉体的和精神的禀赋都倾向于走向完善化。

凝视树木交错的河岸，许多种类的无数植物覆盖其上，群鸟鸣于灌木丛中，各种昆虫飞来飞去，蠕虫在湿土里爬动，并且默想一下，这些构造精巧的类型，彼此这样相异，并以这样复杂的方式相互依存，而它们都是由于在我们周围发生作用的法则产生出来的，这岂非有趣之事。这些法则就其最广泛的意义来说，就是伴随着“生殖”的“生长”；几乎包含在生殖以内的“遗传”；由于生活条件的间接、直接作用以及由于使用不使用所引起的“变异性”：“生殖率”如此之高以致引起“生存斗争”，因而导致“自然选择”，并引起“性状分歧”和较少改进类型的“灭绝”。这样，从自然界的战争里，从饥饿和死亡里，便能体会到最可赞美的目的，即高级动物的产生，直接随之而至。认为生命及其若干能力原来是由“造物主”注入少数类型或一个类型中去的，而且随着地球按照引力的既定法则持续运行，最美丽最奇异的类型从如此简单的始端，过去、曾经而且现今还在进化着，无穷无尽；这种生命观点是极其壮丽的。





附录　有关“物种起源”见解的发展史略


关于物种起源的见解的发展情况，我在这里扼要叙述。直到最近，大多数博物学者依旧相信物种是不变的产物，并且是分别创造出来的。许多作者能干地支持了这一观点。另一方面，少数学者相信物种经历着变异，而且现存生物类型都是既往生存类型所真正传下来的后裔。古代学者只是引经据典地谈论到这个问题，近代学者能以科学精神讨论这个问题的，首推布丰（Buffon），但他的见解在不同时期变动很大，也没有讨论物种变换的原因和途径，在此无须详述。

拉马克是深究这个问题的第一人，其结论引起了广泛的注意。这位名副其实的博物学家在1801年首次发表了他的观点；1809年在《动物学的哲学》（Philosophie Zoologique）里，1815年又在《无脊椎动物志》（Hist．Nat．des Animaux Sans Vertebres）的引言里大大地扩充了自己的观点。他这些著作主张包括人类在内的一切物种都是从其他物种传承下来的学说。他率先登高一呼，唤起了人们注意到有机界以及无机界的一切变化都是根据法则发生的，而不是神灵干预的结果这种可能性。拉马克关于物种渐变的结论，动因似乎主要是物种和变种难于区分，某些群中具有几近完全级进的类型，以及家养生物的相似。他把变异的途径，部分归因于物理的生活条件的直接作用，部分归因于现存类型的杂交，更重要的归因于使用和不使用，即习性的作用。他似乎把自然界中一切美妙适应都归因于用废的作用——例如长颈鹿的长颈是由于取食树叶所致。但同时他还相信“向前发展”（progressive development）的法则；由于一切生物类型都倾向于向前走，为了解释今日简单生物的存在，他主张这些类型都是现在自发产生的。

依据其子写的“传记”，圣提雷尔早在1795年就推想所谓的物种是同一类型的各种退化产物。直到1828年，他才发表意见，认为自万物起源以来，同一类型没有永存不灭的。关于变化原因，他似乎主要倚重于生活条件，即“周围世界”。他慎于下结论，并不相信现存物种还在进行变异。正如其子所追记的：“假设未来必须提出这问题，这将是完全留给未来的一个问题。”

1813年，韦尔斯（H．C．Wells）博士在皇家学会宣读过《一位白种妇女局部皮肤类似黑人皮肤的报告》，但论文直到他的名著《关于复视和单视的两篇论文》1818年发表之后方才问世。文中明确承认了自然选择的原理，这是最早表态的认识；但他仅把这一原理应用于人种，而且只限于某些性状。指出黑人和黑白混血种对某些热带疾病具有免疫力之后，他说，第一，一切动物多少都有变异的倾向；第二，农学家利用选择来改进驯养动物。他接着说道：“人工选择所曾完成的，似乎自然也可以同样有效地做到，以形成人类的变种，适应于所居住的地方，只不过来得徐缓而已。最初散住在非洲中部的少数居民中，可能发生一些偶然的人类变种，其中有的人更适于抗拒当地的疾病。结果，这个种族的繁衍增多，而其他种族则衰减；不仅由于无力抗拒疾病的打击，也由于无力同更强壮的邻族进行竞争。如上所述，我认为这个强壮种族的肤色当然是黑的。但是，形成这些变种的同一倾向依然存在，于是随着时间的推移，愈来愈黑的种族就出现了：既然最黑的种族最能适应当地气候，那么在其发源地，即使不是唯一的种族，最终也会变成最占优势的种族。”然后他又把同样的观点引申到在气候较冷地区居住的白种人。我感谢美国的罗利（Rowley）先生，他通过布雷思（Brace）先生使我注意到韦尔斯先生著作中的上述一段。

赫伯特牧师后来曾任曼彻斯特教长，1822年，《园艺学报》（Horticultural Transactions）第四卷和他的著作《石蒜科》（Amaryllidaceae）一书（1837年，19页，339页）宣称，“园艺试验不可反驳地证明了植物学上的物种不过是比较高级和稳定的变种而已”。他把同一观点引申到动物方面。这位教长相信，每一个属的单一物种都是在原来可塑性很大的情况下被创造出来的；这些物种主要由于杂交，而且也由于变异，产生了现存的一切物种。

1862年，葛兰特（Grant）教授在其讨论《淡水海绵》（Spongilla）的著名论文结尾一段中（《爱丁堡科学学报》［Endinburg Philosophical Journal］，第十四卷，283页）明确宣称，他相信物种是由其他物种传下来的，并且在变异过程中得到改进。1834年在《柳叶刀》上发表他的第五十五次讲演，论述同一观点。

1831年，帕特里克·马修（Patrick Mathew）先生发表了《造船木材及植树》的著作，明确提出关于物种起源的观点，同华莱士（Wallace）先生和我自己在《林奈学报》（Linnean Journal）上所发表的观点（下详）以及本书所扩充的这一观点恰相吻合。遗憾的是，马修先生的这一观点只是很简略地散见于一部其他论题著作的附录中，直到马修先生本人在1860年4月7日的《园艺者记录》（Gardener's Chronicle）中提请注意之前，并没有引起人们的注意。马修先生和我的观点差异是无关紧要的；他似乎认为世界上栖息者在陆续的时期内几近灭绝，其后又重新充满；他还指出“没有先前生物的模型或胚种”，也可能产生新类型。我不敢说对全文的一些章节都懂了，但他似乎认为生活条件的直接作用具有重大的影响。不过，他已清楚地看到了自然选择原理的十足力量。

著名的地质学家和博物学家冯布赫（Von Buch）在《加那利群岛自然地理描述》（Description Physique des lsles Canaries，1836年，147页）这一大作中明确地表示相信，变种可以慢慢到变为永久的物种，而物种就不能再进行杂交了。

拉菲奈斯克（Rafinesque）在1836年出版的《北美洲新植物志》（New Flora of North America）第六页里写道：“一切物种可能一度都是变种，并且很多变种由于呈现固定和特殊的性状而逐渐变为物种”。但是往下去到了18页，他却写道：“原始类型，即属的祖先则属例外。”

1843—1844年，霍尔德曼（Haldeman）教授在《美国波士顿博物学学报》（Boston Journal of Nat．Hist．U．States，第四卷，468页）上对物种的发展和变异巧妙地举出了赞成和反对的两方面假设，他似乎倾向于物种有变异那一方面的。

1844年，《创世遗迹》一书问世。在大事修订的第十版（1853年）里，这位匿名的作者写道（155页）：“经过仔细考察之后，我决定主张生物界的若干系列，从最简单最古老达到最高级最近代的过程，都是在上帝的意旨下，受着两种冲动的结果：第一是生物类型被赋予的冲动，这种冲动在一定时期内，靠生殖，通过直到最高级双子叶植物和脊椎动物为止的诸级体制，使生物前进，这些级数并不多，而且一般有生物性状的间隔作为标志，我们发现其间隔在确定亲缘关系上是一种实际的困难；第二是与生命力相联结的另一种冲动，这种冲动代复一代地按照外界环境、食物、栖息地的性质以及气候的作用使生物构造发生变异，这就是自然神学所谓的‘适应性’。”作者显然相信生物体制的进展是突然跃进式的，但生活条件所产生的作用则是逐渐的。他根据一般理由极力主张物种并不是不变的产物。但我无法理解这两种假定的“冲动”如何在科学意义上去阐明整个自然界里所看到的无数而美妙的相互适应。例如，无法理解就此能揭示啄木鸟何以变得适应于它的特殊习性。这一著作在最初几版中所显示的正确知识虽然很少，而且极其缺少科学上的严谨，但由于它的锋利而瑰丽的风格，还是立即广为流传。我认为这部著作在英国已经做出了卓越的贡献，唤起了人们对这一问题的注意，消除了偏见，这样就为接受类似的观点打下基础。

1846年，资深地质学家窦马留斯·达罗（N．J．d'Omalius d'Halloy）在一篇短而精湛的论文（《布鲁塞尔皇家学会学报》［Bulletins de l'Acad．Roy Bruxelles］，第十三卷，581页）里表达了他的见解，认为新的物种由变异传承而来的说法似较分别创造的说法更为确实可信，这位作者在1831年首次发表了这一见解。

欧文教授在1849年写道（《四肢的性质》［Nature of Limbs］，86页）：“原始型（archetype）的观念，远在实际例示这种观念的那些动物种存在之前，就在地球上有血有肉地在种种变态下表示出来了。至于这等生物现象有次序的继承和进展依据什么自然法则或次级原因，至今还一无所知。”1858年，他在“英国科学协会”（British Association）演讲时曾谈到，“创造力的连续作用，即生物依规定而形成的原理”（第51页）。谈到地理分布之后，他补充说（90页），“这些现象使我们对如下结论的信念发生了动摇：新西兰的无翅鸟（Apteryx）和英国的红松鸡（Red grouse）是在这些岛上特地分别创造出来的动物。还有，应该永远牢记，动物学者所谓‘创造’的意思就是‘他不知道是什么的过程’”。他对这一观念做了扩充，补充说，红松鸡这样的情形“被学者用来作为这种鸟在这些岛上和为了这些岛而被特别创造的例证”时，他主要表示自己不知道红松鸡怎样在那里发生，而且专限于此；同时这种表示无知的方法也表示了他如下的信念：无论鸟和岛的起源都是由于伟大的第一“创造事业”。如果把同一演讲中这些词句相互参照解释，看来这位哲学家1858年对下述信念已经发生了动摇，即“他不知道”无翅鸟和红松鸟怎样在它们各自的乡土上发生，也就是说，“不知道它们的发生过程”。

这一演讲是在华莱士先生和我关于物种起源的论文在林奈学会宣读（下详）之后发表的。当本书初版刊行时，我和其他许多人士一样，完全被“创造力的连续作用”所蒙蔽，以致我把欧文教授同其他坚定相信物种不变的古生物学者们放在一起，但后来发现这是我十分荒谬的误解（《脊椎动物的解剖》［Anat．of Vertebrates］，第三卷，796页）。在本书再版里，我根据以“无疑的基本型（type-form）”开始的一段话（同前书，第一卷，35页），推论欧文教授承认自然选择对新种的形成可能起过一些作用，至今我依然认为这个推论是合理的；但根据该书第三卷798页，这似乎是不正确的，而且缺证据。我也曾摘录过欧文教授和《伦敦评论报》（London Review）编辑之间的通信，该报编辑和我本人都觉得欧文教授是申述，在我之前他已发表了自然选择学说；对于这一宣告我表示过惊奇和满意；但根据能理解的最近发表的一些章节（同前书，第三卷，798页）看来，我又部分地或全部地陷入了误解。使我感到安慰的是，其他人也像我那样发现欧文教授的引起争论的文章是难于理解的，而且前后不一致。至于欧文教授是否在我之前发表自然选择学说，这无关紧要，因为在这章《史略》里已经说明，韦尔斯博士和马修先生早已走在我们两人的前面了。

小圣提雷尔在1850年的讲演中（其提要曾在《动物学评论杂志》［Revue et Mag．de Zoolog．；1851年1月］上发表）简略说明为什么相信物种性状“处于同一状态的环境条件下会保持不变，如果周围环境有所变化，则其性状也要随之变化”。他又说，“总之，对野生动物的观察已经阐明了物种的有限变异性。对野生动物变为家养动物以及家养动物返归野生状态的经验，更明确证明了这一点。这些经验还证实了如此发生的变异具有属的价值”。他在《博物学通论》（1859年，第二卷，430页）中又扩充了相似的结论。

根据最近出版的通报，看来弗瑞克（Freke）博士1851年就提出了学说，认为一切生物都是从一个原始类型传下来的（《都柏林医学通讯》［Dublin Medical Press］，322页）。他的根据以及处理问题的方法同我的完全不同；现在（1861年）弗瑞克博士发表了一篇论文，题为《依据生物的亲缘关系说物种起源》，那么再费力叙述他的观点，对我来说就是多余的了。

赫伯特·斯潘塞（Herbert Spencer）先生在一篇论文（原发表于《领导报》［Leader］，1852年3月。1858年在其论文集中重印）里，非常精辟而有力地对生物的“创造说”和“发展说”进行了对比。他根据家养生物的类比，根据许多物种的胚胎所经历的变化，根据物种和变种的难于区分，根据生物的一般级进变化的原理，论证了物种曾经发生过变异；并把这种变异归因于环境的变化。这位作者（1855）还根据每一智力都必然逐级获得的原理来讨论心理学。

1852年，著名的植物学家M．诺丁（Naudin）在一篇讨论物种起源的雄文（原发表于《园艺学评论》［Revue Horticole］，102页，后重刊于《博物馆新报》［Nouvelles Archives du Muséum］，第一卷，171页）明确地表达了自己的信念，认为物种形成的方式同变种在栽培状况下形成的方式是类似的，并把后一形成过程归因于人类的选择力量。但他没有阐明选择在自然状况下是怎样起作用的。就像赫伯特教长那样，他也相信物种在初生时，其可塑性比现在的物种大。他强调他所谓的目的论（principle of finality），是“一种神秘的、不确定的力量，对某些生物而言，是宿命；对另外一些生物而言，是上帝的意志。为了所属类族的命运，这一力量对生物所进行的持续作用，便在世界存在的全部时期内决定了各个生物的形态、体量和寿命。正是这一力量促成了个体和整体的和谐，使其适应于它在整个自然机构中所担负的功能，这就是它之所以存在的原因”。

1853年，著名地质学家凯萨林（Keyserling）伯爵（《地质学会会报》［Bulletin de la Soc．Geolog］，第二编，第十卷，357页），提出正如假定由瘴气所引起的新病发生而且传遍全球，那么现存物种的胚在某一时期内，也可能从其周围的具有特殊性质的分子那里受到化学影响，而产生新类型。

同年，即1853年，沙福赫生（Schaaffhausen）博士发表了内容精辟的小册子（《普鲁士莱茵地方博物学协会讨论会纪要》［Verhand．Des Naturhist．Vereins der Preuss Rheinlands］），主张地球上的生物类型是发展的。他推论许多物种长期保持不变，而少数物种则发生了变异。他以各级中间类型的毁灭来说明物种的区分。“现在生存的动植物并非由于新的创造而脱离了绝灭的生物，而可以看作是绝灭生物的继续繁殖下来的后裔。”

法国知名植物学家M．勒考克（Lecoq）在1854年写道（《植物地理学研究》［Etuides sur Geograph Bot．］第一卷，250页）：“可见我们对物种的固定及其变化的研究，直接引导我们走入了两位卓越学者圣提雷尔和歌德所提倡的思想境地。”散见于勒考克这部巨著中的一些其他章节使人有点怀疑，他在物种变异方面究竟把自己的观点引申到怎样地步。

巴登·鲍威尔（Baden Powell）牧师在《各个世界的统一性文集》（Essays on Unity of Worlds，1855年）中以熟练的方法对“创造的哲学”进行了讨论。其中最动人的是，他指出新种的产生是“常规而不是偶发现象”，或者，有如约翰·赫谢尔（John Herschel）爵士所表示的，这是“一种自然过程，同奇迹过程正相反”。

《林奈学报》第三卷刊载了华莱士先生和我的论文，这是在1858年7月1日宣读的。正如本书引言所说的，华莱士先生以可称赞的说服力清晰地传播了自然选择学说。

深受所有动物学者爱戴的冯贝尔（Von Baer）约在1859年发表了他的信念，认为现在完全不同的类型是从单独一个祖先类型传下来的（参阅鲁道夫·瓦格纳［Rodolph Wagner］教授的著作《动物学的人类学研究》［Zoologisch-Anthropologische Untersuchungen］，51页，1861年），这主要是以生物的地理分布法则为依据的。

1859年6月，赫胥黎教授在皇家科学普及会做过讲座，题为“动物界的永久型”。关于这些个案，他说：“如果假定每一物种或每一个大类，都是出于创造力的个别行为，在长年累月的间隔期内，形成和安置于地面上，那么，就很难理解永久型这等事实的意义；最好想一想，这种假定既没有传统也没有圣经支持，而且也和自然界的一般类推法相抵触。相反，如果假定生活在任何时代的物种都是以前物种逐渐变异的结果，同时以此假定来考虑‘永久型’，那么，这些永久型的存在似乎阐明了生物在地质时期中所发生的变异量，和所遭受的整个一系列变化比较起来是微不足道的。这种假定即使没有得到证明，而且又被它的某些支持者可悲地损害了，但依然是生理学所能支持的唯一假定。”

1859年12月，胡克（Hooker）博士的《澳洲植物志引论》（Introduction to the Australian Flora）出版。这部巨著的第一部分承认物种的传承和变异是千真万确的，并且用许多原始观察材料来支持这一学说。

1859年11月24日，本书第一版问世，1860年1月7日第二版刊行。





译后记


达尔文1859年出版的《物种起源》，给人们的生活态度带来了一场革命，明确了自己在宇宙中的地位。这是有史以来出版的最重要的书籍之一，不管读者的专业是文还是理，这是必读书。由于初版1250册当天就被批发一空，人们后来买到的都是经过作者本人修改的再版书。达尔文生性谦虚，在序言中自称是被迫把作品匆匆出版，更由于进化论对于西方的价值体系冲击太大，《物种起源》再版时不断修订。翻译决定选择初版，因为它最鲜活，最引人入胜，大胆，事关重大，是达尔文笔下的最佳杰作。当年激起西方世界思想巨变的，就是这个版本。

自从本书初版以后，争议始终不断，可谓世上争议最大的书。十九世纪的人们舒舒服服享受的各种必然的事，被达尔文推翻了！

在亚马逊网站上，销售《物种起源》初版影印本的网页上，有一篇psychephile的帖子：

阅读《物种起源》，原因只有一个——探索达尔文自己如何首先阐述有史以来最具革命性的科学理论。而达到这个目的只有一个手段——读他原来的论据，阅读1859年出版的第一版以最大力度、清晰简洁地提出的文字。所以，除非你碰巧有大款子买真正的第一版，影印本第一版是阅读达尔文“唯一”的方式，因为所有其他的《起源》平装本都是达尔文的最新版本。不过，哪怕你对生物学历史不感兴趣（混蛋！），或者你认为从《起源》可以学到完整的进化论（傻瓜！），你应该得到这个版本——而绝不是后来的版本。达尔文以后的版本包含许多原版里都没有发现的错误，特别是其中有他原有的论据（通过自然选择进化）渐进减弱的过程，因为输入了拉马克主义（通过继承获得性的性状而进化）。在以后的版本中，达尔文被神秘的傻瓜物理学家们说服，认为他的“地质年代说”是错误的（好像是的！），所以他不得不加快做一切事情的时机，这意味着走私拉马克主义。

另外，历史上曾经发生“进化论”归属问题的公案。长久以来，达尔文和华莱士谁是“进化论之父”，科学界一直争论不休。最近还有好事者用反抄袭软件来评价他们相互之间的相似处。其实，只要看看当时的社会背景就可以判断，除了出于科学精神将自己的发现发表出来，我们很难看到其他“沽名钓誉”的动因：1881年《笨拙》画刊出版的年历画就把达尔文的祖宗画成猴子、爬虫等等，也就是进化论的发现当时并未给他带来荣誉，直到后来被下葬到威斯敏斯特教堂。达尔文与华莱士独立发现了相同的科学理论，自然是惺惺相惜。此后自然选择理论也被称为达尔文主义——这个说法是华莱士首先使用的。

达尔文于是下决心发表他的轰动理论，果然石破天惊。人类社会从此不同了。

INTRODUCTION


When on board H.M.S. “Beagle,” as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.

My work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this Abstract. I have more especially been induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species. Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work—the latter having read my sketch of 1844—honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.

This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements; and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone. I can here give only the general conclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in illustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will suffice. No one can feel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts, with references, on which my conclusions have been grounded; and I hope in a future work to do this. For I am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which I have arrived. A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question; and this cannot possibly be here done.

I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very many naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. I cannot, however, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to Dr. Hooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment.

In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration. Naturalists continually refer to external conditions, such as climate, food, etc., as the only possible cause of variation. In one very limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees. In the case of the misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.

The author of the “Vestiges of Creation” would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of generations, some bird had given birth to a woodpecker, and some plant to the misseltoe, and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained.

It is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation. At the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed; in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best and safest clue. I may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists.

From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this Abstract to Variation under Domestication. We shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his Selection successive slight variations. I will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. We shall, however, be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation. In the next chapter the Struggle for Existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world, which inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase, will be treated of. This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.

This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural Selection almost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved forms of life, and induces what I have called Divergence of Character. In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and of correlation of growth. In the four succeeding chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given: namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly, the subject of Instinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, Hybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the Geological Record. In the next chapter I shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth, their geographical distribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their classification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition. In the last chapter I shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding remarks.

No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us. Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the present welfare, and, as I believe, the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world. Still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history. Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that each species has been independently created—is erroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification.





CHAPTER I　VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION


Causes of Variability—Effects of Habit—Correlation of Growth—Inheritance—Character of Domestic Varieties—Difficulty of distinguishing between Varieties and Species—Origin of Domestic Varieties from one or more Species—Domestic Pigeons, their Differences and Origin—Principle of Selection anciently followed, its Effects—Methodical and Unconscious Selection—Unknown Origin of our Domestic Productions—Circumstances favourable to Man's power of Selection

When we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature. There is, also, I think, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight, that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation; and that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues to vary for many generations. No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.

It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability, whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. Geoffroy St. Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system; this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the organisation, to the action of any change in the conditions of life. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even in the many cases when the male and female unite. How many animals there are which will not breed, though living long under not very close confinement in their native country! This is generally attributed to vitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few such cases it has been found out that very trifling changes, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed. I cannot here enter on the copious details which I have collected on this curious subject; but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the most sterile hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under confinement; and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not quite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or variable.

Sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture; but on this view we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility; and variability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden. I may add, that as some organisms will breed most freely under the most unnatural conditions (for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches), showing that their reproductive system has not been thus affected; so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly—perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.

A long list could easily be given of “sporting plants;” by this term gardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant. Such buds can be propagated by grafting, etc., and sometimes by seed. These “sports” are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under cultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has affected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen. But it is the opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so that, in fact, “sports” support my view, that variability may be largely attributed to the ovules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by the treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception. These cases anyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected, as some authors have supposed, with the act of generation.

Seedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both the young and the parents, as Müller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, and of growth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been direct, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in the same manner. To judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should attribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, etc., is most difficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of plants. Under this point of view, Mr. Buckman's recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable. When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are affected in the same way, the change at first appears to be directly due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be shown that quite opposite conditions produce similar changes of structure. Nevertheless some slight amount of change may, I think, be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life—as, in some cases, increased size from amount of food, colour from particular kinds of food and from light, and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate.

Habit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with plants when transported from one climate to another. In animals it has a more marked effect; for instance, I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild-duck; and I presume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parent. The great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked, in comparison with the state of these organs in other countries, is another instance of the effect of use. Not a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view suggested by some authors, that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals not being much alarmed by danger, seems probable.

There are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly seen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. I will here only allude to what may be called correlation of growth. Any change in the embryo or larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's great work on this subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical; thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf; colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants. From the facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons. Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth.

The result of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc.; and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. The whole organisation seems to have become plastic, and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type.

Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, is endless. Dr. Prosper Lucas's treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this subject. No breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone. When a deviation appears not unfrequently, and we see it in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same original cause acting on both; but when amongst individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent—say, once amongst several million individuals—and it reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, etc., appearing in several members of the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.

The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, and in individuals of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of some little importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males alone. A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many cases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity, and not to its primary cause, which may have acted on the ovules or male element; in nearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, the greater length of horn, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element.

Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists—namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be quite necessary, in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,—that is, to lose their acquired characters, whilst kept under unchanged conditions, and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations of structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would be opposed to all experience. I may add, that when under nature the conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved.

When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with species closely allied together, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species. Domestic races of the same species, also, often have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other, and from the other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed,—a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as, only in most cases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of the same genus in a state of nature. I think this must be admitted, when we find that there are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or plants, which have not been ranked by some competent judges as mere varieties, and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species. If any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species, this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur. It has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value. I think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct; but naturalists differ most widely in determining what characters are of generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. Moreover, on the view of the origin of genera which I shall presently give, we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions.

When we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt, from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent-species. This point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for instance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind so truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied and natural species—for instance, of the many foxes—inhabiting different quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we shall presently see, that all our dogs have descended from any one wild species; but, in the case of some other domestic races, there is presumptive, or even strong, evidence in favour of this view.

It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other climates? Has the little variability of the ass or guinea-fowl, or the small power of endurance of warmth by the rein-deer, or of cold by the common camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied.

In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, I do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they have descended from one or several species. The argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is, that we find in the most ancient records, more especially on the monuments of Egypt, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of the breeds closely resemble, perhaps are identical with, those still existing. Even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case, what does it show, but that some of our breeds originated there, four or five thousand years ago? But Mr. Horner's researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the Nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago; and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods, savages, like those of Tierra del Fuego or Australia, who possess a semi-domestic dog, may not have existed in Egypt?

The whole subject must, I think, remain vague; nevertheless, I may, without here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other considerations, I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species. In regard to sheep and goats I can form no opinion. I should think, from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on the habits, voice, and constitution, etc., of the humped Indian cattle, that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our European cattle; and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent. With respect to horses, from reasons which I cannot give here, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that all the races have descended from one wild stock. Mr. Blyth, whose opinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, I should value more than that of almost any one, thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild Indian fowl (Gallus bankiva). In regard to ducks and rabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure, I do not doubt that they all have descended from the common wild duck and rabbit.

The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats in Europe alone, and several even within Great Britain. One author believes that there formerly existed in Great Britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it! When we bear in mind that Britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct from those of Germany and conversely, and so with Hungary, Spain, etc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in Europe; for whence could they have been derived, as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? So it is in India. Even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world, which I fully admit have probably descended from several wild species, I cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. Who can believe that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the bloodhound, the bull-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.—so unlike all wild Canidae—ever existed freely in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can get only forms in some degree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, etc., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. There can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels, which present any desired character; but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species, I can hardly believe. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimentised for this object, and failed. The offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations, hardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme difficulty, or rather utter hopelessness, of the task becomes apparent. Certainly, a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long-continued selection; nor can I find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed.




On the Breeds of the Domestic Pigeon.—Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed which I could purchase or obtain, and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world, more especially by the Honourable W. Elliot from India, and by the Honourable C. Murray from Persia. Many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of considerable antiquity. I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been permitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is something astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and tails, others singularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but, instead of a very long beak, has a very short and very broad one. The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even laughter. The turbit has a very short and conical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the oesophagus. The Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its size, much elongated wing and tail feathers. The trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very different coo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family; and these feathers are kept expanded, and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch; the oil-gland is quite aborted. Several other less distinct breeds might have been specified.

In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. The shape, as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw, varies in a highly remarkable manner. The number of the caudal and sacral vertebrae vary; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes. The size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula. The proportional width of the gape of mouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length of beak), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus; the development and abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body; the relative length of leg and of the feet; the number of scutellae on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs vary. The manner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the voice and disposition. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other.

Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not believe that any ornithologist would place the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could be shown him.

Great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that all have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each other in the most trifling respects. As several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I will here briefly give them. If the several breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or willingly perching on trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable characters, seems very improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But birds breeding on precipices, and good fliers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several above-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native country; but not one has ever become wild or feral, though the dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state, has become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement.

An argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their structure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure: we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak like that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like those of the fantail. Hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown. So many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.

Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump (the Indian sub-species, C. intermedia of Strickland, having it bluish); the tail has a terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some semi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides the two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in every one of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes concur perfectly developed. Moreover, when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has any of the above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters; for instance, I crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they produced mottled brown and black birds; these I again crossed together, and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour, with the white rump, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral characters, if all the domestic breeds have descended from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. Either, firstly, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen or, at most, within a score of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any character derived from such cross will naturally become less and less, as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a character, which has been lost during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations. These two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance.

Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of pigeons are perfectly fertile. I can state this from my own observations, purposely made on the most distinct breeds. Now, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals clearly distinct being themselves perfectly fertile. Some authors believe that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility: from the history of the dog I think there is some probability in this hypothesis, if applied to species closely related together, though it is unsupported by a single experiment. But to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly fertile, inter se, seems to me rash in the extreme.

From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very abnormal characters in certain respects, as compared with all other Columbidae, though so like in most other respects to the rock-pigeon; the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile;—from these several reasons, taken together, I can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the Columba livia with its geographical sub-species.




In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that C. livia, or the rock-pigeon, has been found capable of domestication in Europe and in India; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds. Secondly, although an English carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these breeds, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure. Thirdly, those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed, for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail, are in each breed eminently variable; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been watched, and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Aegyptian dynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius; but Mr. Birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; “nay, they are come to this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race.” Pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan in India, about the year 1600; never less than 20000 pigeons were taken with the court. “The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare birds;” and, continues the courtly historian, “His Majesty by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them astonishingly.” About this same period the Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans. The paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone, will be obvious when we treat of Selection. We shall then, also, see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.

I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature. One circumstance has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom I have ever conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species. Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from long-horns, and he will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise on pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could be given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races; and though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations. May not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the same parents—may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species?




Selection.—Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced, either from one or from several allied species. Some little effect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the external conditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon. One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teazle, with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep. But when we compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man in very different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with “everlasting layers” which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than to mere variability. We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we know that this has not been their history. The key is man's power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them up in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds.

The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It is certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single lifetime, modified to a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep. In order fully to realise what they have done, it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an animal's organisation as something quite plastic, which they can model almost as they please. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturists than almost any other individual, and who was himself a very good judge of an animal, speaks of the principle of selection as “that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether. It is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases.” Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep, says:—“It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself, and then had given it existence.” That most skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that “he would produce any given feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak.” In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.

What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been exported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds; all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst closely allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye—differences which I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.

The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. We have proofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact records have been kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted. We see an astonishing improvement in many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the “rogues,” as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals this kind of selection is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed.

In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection—namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See how different the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever, perhaps never, the case. The laws of correlation of growth, the importance of which should never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, I cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters.

It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have been published on the subject; and the result, I may add, has been, in a corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several references to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high antiquity. In rude and barbarous periods of English history choice animals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the “roguing” of plants by nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese encyclopaedia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to. Savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny. The savages in South Africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the Esquimaux their teams of dogs. Livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the interior of Africa who have not associated with Europeans. Some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages. It would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.

At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to anything existing in the country. But, for our purpose, a kind of Selection, which may be called Unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed. Nevertheless I cannot doubt that this process, continued during centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as Bakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their own lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago, which might serve for comparison. In some cases, however, unchanged or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less improved. There is reason to believe that King Charles's spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the fox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually, that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our pointer.

By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole body of English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent Arab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights they carry. Lord Spencer and others have shown how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early maturity, compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. By comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in Britain, India, and Persia, we can, I think, clearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.

Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far that the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have produced the result which ensued—namely, the production of two distinct strains. The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, “have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr. Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties.”

If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs.

In plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the occasional preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks. No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant. No one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in classical times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have been a fruit of very inferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners, in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art, I cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it, and so onwards. But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree, to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.

A large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.

In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at least during certain seasons. And in two countries very differently circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country than in the other, and thus by a process of “natural selection,” as will hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. This, perhaps, partly explains what has been remarked by some authors, namely, that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species than the varieties kept in civilised countries.

On the view here given of the all-important part which selection by man has played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or fancies. We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. Man can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail, till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention. But to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail, is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly incorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,—a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the breed.

Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight, in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds have once fairly been established. Many slight differences might, and indeed do now, arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed. The common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse and the common breed, which differ only in colour, that most fleeting of characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.

I think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticed—namely, that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be said to have had a definite origin. A man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them, and the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. But as yet they will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their history will be disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a provincial name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free communication, the spreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed will be a slow process. As soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed are once fully acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious selection will always tend,—perhaps more at one period than at another, as the breed rises or falls in fashion,—perhaps more in one district than in another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants,—slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be. But the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes.

I must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the reverse, to man's power of selection. A high degree of variability is obviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction. But as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. On this principle Marshall has remarked, with respect to the sheep of parts of Yorkshire, that “as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly in small lots, they never can be improved.” On the other hand, nurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same plants, are generally far more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. The keeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of life, so as to breed freely in that country. When the individuals of any species are scanty, all the individuals, whatever their quality may be, will generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent selection. But probably the most important point of all, is, that the animal or plant should be so highly useful to man, or so much valued by him, that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the qualities or structure of each individual. Unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this plant. No doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from them, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then, there appeared (aided by some crossing with distinct species) those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during the last thirty or forty years.

In the case of animals with separate sexes, facility in preventing crosses is an important element of success in the formation of new races,—at least, in a country which is already stocked with other races. In this respect enclosure of the land plays a part. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species. Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for thus many races may be kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds. Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, cannot be matched, and, although so much valued by women and children, we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often from islands. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, etc., may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds.

To sum up on the origin of our Domestic Races of animals and plants. I believe that the conditions of life, from their action on the reproductive system, are so far of the highest importance as causing variability. I do not believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency, under all circumstances, with all organic beings, as some authors have thought. The effects of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance and of reversion. Variability is governed by many unknown laws, more especially by that of correlation of growth. Something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life. Something must be attributed to use and disuse. The final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In some cases, I do not doubt that the intercrossing of species, aboriginally distinct, has played an important part in the origin of our domestic productions. When in any country several domestic breeds have once been established, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the importance of the crossing of varieties has, I believe, been greatly exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed. In plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings, buds, etc., the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties is immense; for the cultivator here quite disregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the frequent sterility of hybrids; but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. Over all these causes of Change I am convinced that the accumulative action of Selection, whether applied methodically and more quickly, or unconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the predominant Power.





CHAPTER II　VARIATION UNDER NATURE


Variability—Individual differences—Doubtful species—Wide ranging, much diffused, and common species vary most—Species of the larger genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera—Many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having restricted ranges

Before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic beings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these latter are subject to any variation. To treat this subject at all properly, a long catalogue of dry facts should be given; but these I shall reserve for my future work. Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species. No one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species. Generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation. The term “variety” is almost equally difficult to define; but here community of descent is almost universally implied, though it can rarely be proved. We have also what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. By a monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious to or not useful to the species, and not generally propagated. Some authors use the term “variation” in a technical sense, as implying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life; and “variations” in this sense are supposed not to be inherited: but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the Baltic, or dwarfed plants on Alpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would not in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations? and in this case I presume that the form would be called a variety.

Again, we have many slight differences which may be called individual differences, such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from the same parents, or which may be presumed to have thus arisen, from being frequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality. No one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the very same mould. These individual differences are highly important for us, as they afford materials for natural selection to accumulate, in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given direction individual differences in his domesticated productions. These individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant parts; but I could show by a long catalogue of facts, that parts which must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species. I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important parts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have collected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important characters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the same species. I should never have expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species; I should have expected that changes of this nature could have been effected only by slow degrees: yet quite recently Mr. Lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in Coccus, which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree. This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also quite recently shown that the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are very far from uniform. Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank that character as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed) which does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of an important part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given.

There is one point connected with individual differences, which seems to me extremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have sometimes been called “protean” or “polymorphic,” in which the species present an inordinate amount of variation; and hardly two naturalists can agree which forms to rank as species and which as varieties. We may instance Rubus, Rosa, and Hieracium amongst plants, several genera of insects, and several genera of Brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite characters. Genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be, with some few exceptions, polymorphic in other countries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod shells, at former periods of time. These facts seem to be very perplexing, for they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life. I am inclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species, and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection, as hereafter will be explained.

Those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of species, but which are so closely similar to some other forms, or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the most important for us. We have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closely-allied forms have permanently retained their characters in their own country for a long time; for as long, as far as we know, as have good and true species. Practically, when a naturalist can unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters, he treats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common, but sometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other as the variety. But cases of great difficulty, which I will not here enumerate, sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another, even when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor will the commonly-assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always remove the difficulty. In very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a variety of another, not because the intermediate links have actually been found, but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.

Hence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many cases, decide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and well-known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges.

That varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be disputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France or of the United States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species, and by another as mere varieties. Mr. H. C. Watson, to whom I lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for me 182 British plants, which are generally considered as varieties, but which have all been ranked by botanists as species; and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species, and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera. Under genera, including the most polymorphic forms, Mr. Babington gives 251 species, whereas Mr. Bentham gives only 112,—a difference of 139 doubtful forms! Amongst animals which unite for each birth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can rarely be found within the same country, but are common in separated areas. How many of those birds and insects in North America and Europe, which differ very slightly from each other, have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species, and by another as varieties, or, as they are often called, as geographical races! Many years ago, when comparing, and seeing others compare, the birds from the separate islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, both one with another, and with those from the American mainland, I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties. On the islets of the little Madeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties in Mr. Wollaston's admirable work, but which it cannot be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists. Even Ireland has a few animals, now generally regarded as varieties, but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists. Several most experienced ornithologists consider our British red grouse as only a strongly-marked race of a Norwegian species, whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to Great Britain. A wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct species; but what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice? if that between America and Europe is ample, will that between the Continent and the Azores, or Madeira, or the Canaries, or Ireland, be sufficient? It must be admitted that many forms, considered by highly-competent judges as varieties, have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked by other highly-competent judges as good and true species. But to discuss whether they are rightly called species or varieties, before any definition of these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air.

Many of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species well deserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from geographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, etc., have been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank. I will here give only a single instance,—the well-known one of the primrose and cowslip, or Primula veris and elatior. These plants differ considerably in appearance; they have a different flavour and emit a different odour; they flower at slightly different periods; they grow in somewhat different stations; they ascend mountains to different heights; they have different geographical ranges; and lastly, according to very numerous experiments made during several years by that most careful observer Gärtner, they can be crossed only with much difficulty. We could hardly wish for better evidence of the two forms being specifically distinct. On the other hand, they are united by many intermediate links, and it is very doubtful whether these links are hybrids; and there is, as it seems to me, an overwhelming amount of experimental evidence, showing that they descend from common parents, and consequently must be ranked as varieties.

Close investigation, in most cases, will bring naturalists to an agreement how to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be confessed, that it is in the best-known countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful value. I have been struck with the fact, that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man, or from any cause closely attract his attention, varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded. These varieties, moreover, will be often ranked by some authors as species. Look at the common oak, how closely it has been studied; yet a German author makes more than a dozen species out of forms, which are very generally considered as varieties; and in this country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties.

When a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite unknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences to consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is subject; and this shows, at least, how very generally there is some variation. But if he confine his attention to one class within one country, he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms. His general tendency will be to make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the pigeon or poultry-fancier before alluded to, with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually studying; and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and in other countries, by which to correct his first impressions. As he extends the range of his observations, he will meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater number of closely-allied forms. But if his observations be widely extended, he will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which species; but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation,—and the truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists. When, moreover, he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous, in which case he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms, he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his difficulties will rise to a climax.

Certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub-species—that is, the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at the rank of species; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or between lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences blend into each other in an insensible series; and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage.

Hence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the systematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history. And I look at varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent, as steps leading to more strongly marked and more permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading to sub-species, and to species. The passage from one stage of difference to another and higher stage may be, in some cases, due merely to the long-continued action of different physical conditions in two different regions; but I have not much faith in this view; and I attribute the passage of a variety, from a state in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it differs more, to the action of natural selection in accumulating (as will hereafter be more fully explained) differences of structure in certain definite directions. Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be justly called an incipient species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this work.

It need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily attain the rank of species. They may whilst in this incipient state become extinct, or they may endure as varieties for very long periods, as has been shown to be the case by Mr. Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land-shells in Madeira. If a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species, it would then rank as the species, and the species as the variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent species. But we shall hereafter have to return to this subject.

From these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species, as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual differences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience sake.

Guided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the species which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several well-worked floras. At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H. C. Watson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on this subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as did subsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms. I shall reserve for my future work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables themselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species. Dr. Hooker permits me to add, that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined the tables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well established. The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to the “struggle for existence,” “divergence of character,” and other questions, hereafter to be discussed.

Alph. De Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide ranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected, as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they come into competition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more important circumstance) with different sets of organic beings. But my tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which are most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country (and this is a different consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness), often give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical works. Hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the dominant species,— those which range widely over the world, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in individuals,—which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as I consider them, incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have been anticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country, the species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield offspring which, though in some slight degree modified, will still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots.

If the plants inhabiting a country and described in any Flora be divided into two equal masses, all those in the larger genera being placed on one side, and all those in the smaller genera on the other side, a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will be found on the side of the larger genera. This, again, might have been anticipated; for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we might have expected to have found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a large proportional number of dominant species. But so many causes tend to obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of the larger genera. I will here allude to only two causes of obscurity. Fresh-water and salt-loving plants have generally very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong. Again, plants low in the scale of organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here again there is no close relation to the size of the genera. The cause of lowly-organised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on geographical distribution.

From looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the smaller genera; for wherever many closely related species (i.e. species of the same genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species ought, as a general rule, to be now forming. Where many large trees grow, we expect to find saplings. Where many species of a genus have been formed through variation, circumstances have been favourable for variation; and hence we might expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to variation. On the other hand, if we look at each species as a special act of creation, there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species, than in one having few.

To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side, and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera present varieties, than on the side of the smaller genera. Moreover, the species of the large genera which present any varieties, invariably present a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the small genera. Both these results follow when another division is made, and when all the smallest genera, with from only one to four species, are absolutely excluded from the tables. These facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties; for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one. And this certainly is the case, if varieties be looked at as incipient species; for my tables clearly show as a general rule that, wherever many species of a genus have been formed, the species of that genus present a number of varieties, that is of incipient species, beyond the average. It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are thus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera are now varying and increasing; for if this had been so, it would have been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size; and that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and disappeared. All that we want to show is, that where many species of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming; and this holds good.

There are other relations between the species of large genera and their recorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked varieties; and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been found between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by the amount of difference between them, judging by analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species. Hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species or varieties. Now Fries has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in regard to insects, that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small. I have endeavoured to test this numerically by averages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they always confirm the view. I have also consulted some sagacious and most experienced observers, and, after deliberation, they concur in this view. In this respect, therefore, the species of the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the species of the smaller genera. Or the case may be put in another way, and it may be said, that in the larger genera, in which a number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing, many of the species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties, for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference.

Moreover, the species of the large genera are related to each other, in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other. No naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct from each other; they may generally be divided into sub-genera, or sections, or lesser groups. As Fries has well remarked, little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around certain other species. And what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally related to each other, and clustered round certain forms—that is, round their parent-species? Undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference between varieties and species; namely, that the amount of difference between varieties, when compared with each other or with their parent-species, is much less than that between the species of the same genus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of Divergence of Character, we shall see how this may be explained, and how the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the greater differences between species.

There is one other point which seems to me worth notice. Varieties generally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely more than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of its supposed parent-species, their denominations ought to be reversed. But there is also reason to believe, that those species which are very closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties, often have much restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H. C. Watson has marked for me in the well-sifted London Catalogue of plants (4th edition) 63 plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these 63 reputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which Mr. Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this same catalogue, 53 acknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces; whereas, the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3 provinces. So that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range, as have those very closely allied forms, marked for me by Mr. Watson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally ranked by British botanists as good and true species.




Finally, then, varieties have the same general characters as species, for they cannot be distinguished from species,—except, firstly, by the discovery of intermediate linking forms, and the occurrence of such links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect; and except, secondly, by a certain amount of difference, for two forms, if differing very little, are generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been discovered; but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite. In genera having more than the average number of species in any country, the species of these genera have more than the average number of varieties. In large genera the species are apt to be closely, but unequally, allied together, forming little clusters round certain species. Species very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges. In all these several respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties. And we can clearly understand these analogies, if species have once existed as varieties, and have thus originated: whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has been independently created.

We have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant species of the larger genera which on an average vary most; and varieties, as we shall hereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct species. The larger genera thus tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants. But by steps hereafter to be explained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera. And thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups.





CHAPTER III　STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE


Bears on natural selection—The term used in a wide sense— Geometrical powers of increase—Rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants—Nature of the checks to increase—Competition universal—Effects of climate—Protection from the number of individuals—Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature—Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties of the same species; often severe between species of the same genus—The relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations

Before entering on the subject of this chapter, I must make a few preliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on Natural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that amongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability; indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed. It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted. But the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the foundation for the work, helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one distinct organic being to another being, been perfected? We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe; and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world.

Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera, and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus, arise? All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow inevitably from the struggle for life. Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of that individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive. I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But Natural Selection, as we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.

We will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence. In my future work this subject shall be treated, as it well deserves, at much greater length. The elder De Candolle and Lyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge. Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more difficult—at least I have found it so—than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, I am convinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with gladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget, that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely these songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be now superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.

I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals in a time of dearth, may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live. But a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle for life against the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which on an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground. The missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees, but can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees, for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish and die. But several seedling missletoes, growing close together on the same branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. As the missletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on birds; and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants. In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence.

A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms; for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them.

There is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny. Linnaeus has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds—and there is no plant so unproductive as this—and their seedlings next year produced two, and so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. The elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase: it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth three pair of young in this interval; if this be so, at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first pair.

But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons. Still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world: if the statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have been quite incredible. So it is with plants: cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years. Several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants, have been introduced from Europe; and there are plants which now range in India, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which have been imported from America since its discovery. In such cases, and endless instances could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree. The obvious explanation is that the conditions of life have been very favourable, and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and young, and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed. In such cases the geometrical ratio of increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of naturalised productions in their new homes.

In a state of nature almost every plant produces seed, and amongst animals there are very few which do not annually pair. Hence we may confidently assert, that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist, and that the geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life. Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead us: we see no great destruction falling on them, and we forget that thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of.

The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is, that the slow-breeders would require a few more years to people, under favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two: the Fulmar petrel lays but one egg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. One fly deposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca, a single one; but this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district. A large number of eggs is of some importance to those species, which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. But the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life; and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one. If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced, or the species will become extinct. It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed, and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place. So that in all cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.

In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mind—never to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life; that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during each generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the destruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount. The face of Nature may be compared to a yielding surface, with ten thousand sharp wedges packed close together and driven inwards by incessant blows, sometimes one wedge being struck, and then another with greater force.

What checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in number is most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as it swarms in numbers, by so much will its tendency to increase be still further increased. We know not exactly what the checks are in even one single instance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head, even in regard to mankind, so incomparably better known than any other animal. This subject has been ably treated by several authors, and I shall, in my future work, discuss some of the checks at considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of South America. Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the reader's mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals seem generally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some observations which I have made, I believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants. Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of the 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown, plants: thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf (three feet by four) nine species perished from the other species being allowed to grow up freely.

The amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to which each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the average numbers of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that the stock of partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed. On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none are destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in India most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.

Climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought, I believe to be the most effective of all checks. I estimated that the winter of 1854-55 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent. is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. Even when climate, for instance extreme cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorous, or those which have got least food through the advancing winter, which will suffer most. When we travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action. But this is a very false view: we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food; and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and, as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will decrease. When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northwards; hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to the directly injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding southwards or in descending a mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.

That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants, nor resist destruction by our native animals.

When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics—at least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals—often ensue: and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals, been disproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.

On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely necessary for its preservation. Thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their numbers are checked during winter: but any one who has tried, knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden; I have in this case lost every single seed. This view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation, explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where they do occur; and that of some social plants being social, that is, abounding in individuals, even on the extreme confines of their range. For in such cases, we may believe, that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist together, and thus save each other from utter destruction. I should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing, and the ill effects of close interbreeding, probably come into play in some of these cases; but on this intricate subject I will not here enlarge.

Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle together in the same country. I will give only a single instance, which, though a simple one, has interested me. In Staffordshire, on the estate of a relation where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand of man; but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir. The change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another: not only the proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants (not counting grasses and carices) flourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The effect on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath; and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds. Here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception that the land had been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how important an element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey. Here there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on the distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close together that all cannot live. When I ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted, I was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking closely between the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little trees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, judging from the rings of growth, had during twenty-six years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was enclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food.

Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch fir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of cattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this; for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. The increase of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually checked by some means, probably by birds. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds (whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to increase in Paraguay, the flies would decrease—then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter (as indeed I have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again would largely affect the insects; and this, as we just have seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity. We began this series by insectivorous birds, and we have ended with them. Not that in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this. Battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying success; and yet in the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced, that the face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time, though assuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another. Nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high our presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!

I am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals, most remote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex relations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic Lobelia fulgens, in this part of England, is never visited by insects, and consequently, from its peculiar structure, never can set a seed. Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I have, also, reason to believe that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. From experiments which I have tried, I have found that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone visit the common red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot reach the nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr. H. Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that “more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.” Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats; and Mr. Newman says, “Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice.” Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!

In the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different periods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come into play; some one check or some few being generally the most potent, but all concurring in determining the average number or even the existence of the species. In some cases it can be shown that widely-different checks act on the same species in different districts. When we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. But how false a view is this! Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down, a very different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancient Indian mounds, in the Southern United States, display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests. What a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries, each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect and insect—between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and beasts of prey—all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! Throw up a handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in the course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old Indian ruins!

The dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its prey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This is often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding quadrupeds. But the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts, require the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. In the case of varieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost equally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided: for instance, if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed seed be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate, or are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more seed, and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other varieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested separately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear. So again with the varieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties will starve out other mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept together. The same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the varieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a mixed stock could be kept up for half a dozen generations, if they were allowed to struggle together, like beings in a state of nature, and if the seed or young were not annually sorted.

As species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably, some similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus, when they come into competition with each other, than between species of distinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the United States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species. The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of Scotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. How frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener. One species of charlock will supplant another, and so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature; but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life.

A corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related, in the most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other organic beings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or from which it has to escape, or on which it preys. This is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger's body. But in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water. Yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by other plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground. In the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well adapted for diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to hunt for its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.

The store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and beans), when sown in the midst of long grass, I suspect that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling, whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around.

Look at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or quadruple its numbers? We know that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case we can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in number, we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors, or over the animals which preyed on it. On the confines of its geographical range, a change of constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far, that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone. Not until we reach the extreme confines of life, in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will competition cease. The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be competition between some few species, or between the individuals of the same species, for the warmest or dampest spots.

Hence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new competitors, though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home, yet the conditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner. If we wished to increase its average numbers in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to what we should have done in its native country; for we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.

It is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another. Probably in no single instance should we know what to do, so as to succeed. It will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to be difficult to acquire. All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio; that each at some period of its life, during some season of the year, during each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to suffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle, we may console ourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant, that no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the vigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.





CHAPTER IV　NATURAL SELECTION


Natural Selection—its power compared with man's selection—its power on characters of trifling importance—its power at all ages and on both sexes—Sexual Selection—On the generality of intercrosses between individuals of the same species— Circumstances favourable and unfavourable to Natural Selection, namely, intercrossing, isolation, number of individuals—Slow action—Extinction caused by Natural Selection—Divergence of Character, related to the diversity of inhabitants of any small area, and to naturalisation—Action of Natural Selection, through Divergence of Character and Extinction, on the descendants from a common parent—Explains the Grouping of all organic beings

How will the struggle for existence, discussed too briefly in the last chapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection, which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply in nature? I think we shall see that it can act most effectually. Let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and, in a lesser degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary tendency is. Under domestication, it may be truly said that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic. Let it be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life. Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations? If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the other hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural Selection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic.

We shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of climate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of the change of climate itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. If the country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate, and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area been open to immigration, these same places would have been seized on by intruders. In such case, every slight modification, which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement.

We have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive system, causes or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing. Not that, as I believe, any extreme amount of variability is necessary; as man can certainly produce great results by adding up in any given direction mere individual differences, so could Nature, but far more easily, from having incomparably longer time at her disposal. Nor do I believe that any great physical change, as of climate, or any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration, is actually necessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants. For as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others; and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage. No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could anyhow be improved; for in all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land. And as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage, so as to have better resisted such intruders.

As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being. She can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for his own good; Nature only for that of the being which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life. Man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country; he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate. He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females. He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his productions. He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form; or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye, or to be plainly useful to him. Under nature, the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for life, and so be preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods. Can we wonder, then, that nature's productions should be far “truer” in character than man's productions; that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship?

It may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest; rejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good; silently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers, at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in progress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.

Although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see leaf-eating insects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in winter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse that of peaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at some period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey,—so much so, that on parts of the Continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to destruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse, and in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant. Nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black. In plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance: yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in the United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a curculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks yellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh. If, with all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature, where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies, such differences would effectually settle which variety, whether a smooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed fruit, should succeed.

In looking at many small points of difference between species, which, as far as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem to be quite unimportant, we must not forget that climate, food, etc., probably produce some slight and direct effect. It is, however, far more necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth, which, when one part of the organisation is modified through variation, and the modifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of the being, will cause other modifications, often of the most unexpected nature.

As we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any particular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the same period;—for instance, in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the down of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult;—so in a state of nature, natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of profitable variations at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. If it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind, I can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly different from those which concern the mature insect. These modifications will no doubt affect, through the laws of correlation, the structure of the adult; and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours, and which never feed, a large part of their structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvae. So, conversely, modifications in the adult will probably often affect the structure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of life, shall not be in the least degree injurious: for if they became so, they would cause the extinction of the species.

Natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relation to the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. In social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the community; if each in consequence profits by the selected change. What natural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species, without giving it any advantage, for the good of another species; and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history, I cannot find one case which will bear investigation. A structure used only once in an animal's whole life, if of high importance to it, might be modified to any extent by natural selection; for instance, the great jaws possessed by certain insects, and used exclusively for opening the cocoon—or the hard tip to the beak of nestling birds, used for breaking the egg. It has been asserted, that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching. Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown pigeon very short for the bird's own advantage, the process of modification would be very slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful and hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or, more delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure.




Sexual Selection.—Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the same fact probably occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection will be able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex, or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is sometimes the case with insects. And this leads me to say a few words on what I call Sexual Selection. This depends, not on a struggle for existence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or no offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural selection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted for their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases, victory will depend not on general vigour, but on having special weapons, confined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur, and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the brutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks. How low in the scale of nature this law of battle descends, I know not; male alligators have been described as fighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like Indians in a war-dance, for the possession of the females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day long; male stag- beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous animals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. The males of carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to others, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection, as the mane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the hooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for victory, as the sword or spear.

Amongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All those who have attended to the subject, believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of Paradise, and some others, congregate; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform strange antics before the females, which standing by as spectators, at last choose the most attractive partner. Those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds. It may appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means: I cannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view; but if man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams, according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect. I strongly suspect that some well-known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection, acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season; the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons, either by the males alone, or by the males and females; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.

Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection; that is, individual males have had, in successive generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons, means of defence, or charms; and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring. Yet, I would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency: for we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals (as the wattle in male carriers, horn-like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls, etc.), which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in battle, or attractive to the females. We see analogous cases under nature, for instance, the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey-cock, which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird;—indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication, it would have been called a monstrosity.




Illustrations of the action of Natural Selection.—In order to make it clear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us take the case of a wolf, which preys on various animals, securing some by craft, some by strength, and some by fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer for instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers, or that other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food. I can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving, and so be preserved or selected,—provided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the year, when they might be compelled to prey on other animals. I can see no more reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.

Even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable; for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one cat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game, another hares or rabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited. Now, if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf, it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring. Some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure, and by the repetition of this process, a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent-form of wolf. Or, again, the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those frequenting the lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey; and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites, two varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would cross and blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the United States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer, and the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks the shepherd's flocks.

Let us now take a more complex case. Certain plants excrete a sweet juice, apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap: this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some Leguminosae, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel. This juice, though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects. Let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the petals of a flower. In this case insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen, and would certainly often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower. The flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of crossing, we have good reason to believe (as will hereafter be more fully alluded to), would produce very vigorous seedlings, which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving. Some of these seedlings would probably inherit the nectar-excreting power. Those individual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries, and which excreted most nectar, would be oftenest visited by insects, and would be oftenest crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand. Those flowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which visited them, so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower, would likewise be favoured or selected. We might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation, its destruction appears a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain to the plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger and larger anthers, would be selected.

When our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or natural selection of more and more attractive flowers, had been rendered highly attractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part, regularly carry pollen from flower to flower; and that they can most effectually do this, I could easily show by many striking instances. I will give only one—not as a very striking case, but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants, presently to be alluded to. Some holly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other holly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and four stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be detected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree, I put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different branches, under the microscope, and on all, without exception, there were pollen-grains, and on some a profusion of pollen. As the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been carried. The weather had been cold and boisterous, and therefore not favourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which I examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen, having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to our imaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another process might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the “physiological division of labour;” hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant, and pistils alone in another flower or on another plant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature, then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be effected.

Let us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case: we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts, showing how anxious bees are to save time; for instance, their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which they can, with a very little more trouble, enter by the mouth. Bearing such facts in mind, I can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of the body, or in the curvature and length of the proboscis, etc., far too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more quickly, and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants. Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight deviation of structure. The tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee. Thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other hand, I have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatly depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push the pollen on to the stigmatic surface. Hence, again, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla, so that the hive-bee could visit its flowers. Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure.

I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were at first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on “the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology;” but we now very seldom hear the action, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a trifling and insignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs. Natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a true principle, banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.




On the Intercrossing of Individuals.—I must here introduce a short digression. In the case of animals and plants with separated sexes, it is of course obvious that two individuals must always unite for each birth; but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious. Nevertheless I am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals, either occasionally or habitually, concur for the reproduction of their kind. This view, I may add, was first suggested by Andrew Knight. We shall presently see its importance; but I must here treat the subject with extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared for an ample discussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects, and some other large groups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites, and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair; that is, two individuals regularly unite for reproduction, which is all that concerns us. But still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair, and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be asked, is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction? As it is impossible here to enter on details, I must trust to some general considerations alone.

In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, showing, in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring; and on the other hand, that close interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility; that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature (utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law) that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity of generations; but that a cross with another individual is occasionally—perhaps at very long intervals—indispensable.

On the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand several large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any other view are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather! but if an occasional cross be indispensable, the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure, more especially as the plant's own anthers and pistil generally stand so close together that self-fertilisation seems almost inevitable. Many flowers, on the other hand, have their organs of fructification closely enclosed, as in the great papilionaceous or pea-family; but in several, perhaps in all, such flowers, there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar; for, in doing this, they either push the flower's own pollen on the stigma, or bring pollen from another flower. So necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers, that I have found, by experiments published elsewhere, that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented. Now, it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower, and not carry pollen from one to the other, to the great good, as I believe, of the plant. Bees will act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is quite sufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation; but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species; for if you bring on the same brush a plant's own pollen and pollen from another species, the former will have such a prepotent effect, that it will invariably and completely destroy, as has been shown by Gärtner, any influence from the foreign pollen.

When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful for this end: but, the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward, as Kölreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry; and curiously in this very genus, which seems to have a special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that if very closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally cross. In many other cases, far from there being any aids for self-fertilisation, there are special contrivances, as I could show from the writings of C. C. Sprengel and from my own observations, which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower: for instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them; and as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I raised plenty of seedlings; and whilst another species of Lobelia growing close by, which is visited by bees, seeds freely. In very many other cases, though there be no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen, yet, as C. C. Sprengel has shown, and as I can confirm, either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these plants have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed. How strange are these facts! How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower, though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of self-fertilisation, should in so many cases be mutually useless to each other! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!

If several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other plants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority, as I have found, of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for instance, I raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties growing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind, and some even of these were not perfectly true. Yet the pistil of each cabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens, but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant. How, then, comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized? I suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent effect over a flower's own pollen; and that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species. When distinct species are crossed the case is directly the reverse, for a plant's own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen; but to this subject we shall return in a future chapter.

In the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers, it may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree, and that flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited sense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes. When the sexes are separated, although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree, we can see that pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. That trees belonging to all Orders have their sexes more often separated than other plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request Dr. Hooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray those of the United States, and the result was as I anticipated. On the other hand, Dr. Hooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold in Australia; and I have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject.

Turning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are some hermaphrodites, as land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these all pair. As yet I have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises itself. We can understand this remarkable fact, which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable, by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live, and the nature of the fertilising element; for we know of no means, analogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants, by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals. Of aquatic animals, there are many self-fertilising hermaphrodites; but here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional cross. And, as in the case of flowers, I have as yet failed, after consultation with one of the highest authorities, namely, Professor Huxley, to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body, that access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible. Cirripedes long appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this point of view; but I have been enabled, by a fortunate chance, elsewhere to prove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising hermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.

It must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, in the case of both animals and plants, species of the same family and even of the same genus, though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole organisation, yet are not rarely, some of them hermaphrodites, and some of them unisexual. But if, in fact, all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross with other individuals, the difference between hermaphrodites and unisexual species, as far as function is concerned, becomes very small.

From these several considerations and from the many special facts which I have collected, but which I am not here able to give, I am strongly inclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature. I am well aware that there are, on this view, many cases of difficulty, some of which I am trying to investigate. Finally then, we may conclude that in many organic beings, a cross between two individuals is an obvious necessity for each birth; in many others it occurs perhaps only at long intervals; but in none, as I suspect, can self-fertilisation go on for perpetuity.




Circumstances favourable to Natural Selection.—This is an extremely intricate subject. A large amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable, but I believe mere individual differences suffice for the work. A large number of individuals, by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations, will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and is, I believe, an extremely important element of success. Though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not grant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may be said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors, it will soon be exterminated.

In man's methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite object, and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. But when many men, without intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of perfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals, much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection, notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with inferior animals. Thus it will be in nature; for within a confined area, with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be, natural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction, though in different degrees, so as better to fill up the unoccupied place. But if the area be large, its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life; and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several districts, there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the confines of each. And in this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each; for in a continuous area, the conditions will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another. The intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each birth, which wander much, and which do not breed at a very quick rate. Hence in animals of this nature, for instance in birds, varieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this I believe to be the case. In hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for each birth, but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate, a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there maintain itself in a body, so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety. A local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts. On the above principle, nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety, as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened.

Even in the case of slow-breeding animals, which unite for each birth, we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural selection; for I can bring a considerable catalogue of facts, showing that within the same area, varieties of the same animal can long remain distinct, from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly different seasons, or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair together.

Intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and uniform in character. It will obviously thus act far more efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth; but I have already attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants. Even if these take place only at long intervals, I am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from long-continued self-fertilisation, that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind; and thus, in the long run, the influence of intercrosses, even at rare intervals, will be great. If there exist organic beings which never intercross, uniformity of character can be retained amongst them, as long as their conditions of life remain the same, only through the principle of inheritance, and through natural selection destroying any which depart from the proper type; but if their conditions of life change and they undergo modification, uniformity of character can be given to their modified offspring, solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable variations.

Isolation, also, is an important element in the process of natural selection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree uniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to the same conditions. Intercrosses, also, with the individuals of the same species, which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts, will be prevented. But isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better adapted organisms, after any physical change, such as of climate or elevation of the land, etc.; and thus new places in the natural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for, and become adapted to, through modifications in their structure and constitution. Lastly, isolation, by checking immigration and consequently competition, will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved; and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species. If, however, an isolated area be very small, either from being surrounded by barriers, or from having very peculiar physical conditions, the total number of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small; and fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new species through natural selection, by decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations.

If we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any small isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the total number of the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these species a very large proportion are endemic,—that is, have been produced there, and nowhere else. Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species. But we may thus greatly deceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a large open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within equal times; and this we are incapable of doing.

Although I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is of more importance, more especially in the production of species, which will prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely. Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these many species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many others. Hence more new places will be formed, and the competition to fill them will be more severe, on a large than on a small and isolated area. Moreover, great areas, though now continuous, owing to oscillations of level, will often have recently existed in a broken condition, so that the good effects of isolation will generally, to a certain extent, have concurred. Finally, I conclude that, although small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new species, yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what is more important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which already have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, will give rise to most new varieties and species, and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world.

We can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for instance, that the productions of the smaller continent of Australia have formerly yielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those of the larger Europaeo-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On a small island, the race for life will have been less severe, and there will have been less modification and less extermination. Hence, perhaps, it comes that the flora of Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles the extinct tertiary flora of Europe. All fresh- water basins, taken together, make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land; and, consequently, the competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe than elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly formed, and old forms more slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water that we find seven genera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale. These anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils; they have endured to the present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition.

To sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. I conclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial productions a large continental area, which will probably undergo many oscillations of level, and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition, will be the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life, likely to endure long and to spread widely. For the area will first have existed as a continent, and the inhabitants, at this period numerous in individuals and kinds, will have been subjected to very severe competition. When converted by subsidence into large separate islands, there will still exist many individuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the confines of the range of each species will thus be checked: after physical changes of any kind, immigration will be prevented, so that new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected. When, by renewed elevation, the islands shall be re-converted into a continental area, there will again be severe competition: the most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less improved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants, and thus produce new species.

That natural selection will always act with extreme slowness, I fully admit. Its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature, which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country undergoing modification of some kind. The existence of such places will often depend on physical changes, which are generally very slow, and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked. But the action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified; the mutual relations of many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed. Nothing can be effected, unless favourable variations occur, and variation itself is apparently always a very slow process. The process will often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing. Many will exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection. I do not believe so. On the other hand, I do believe that natural selection will always act very slowly, often only at long intervals of time, and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. I further believe, that this very slow, intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed.

Slow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of change, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of life, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature's power of selection.




Extinction.—This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on Geology; but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural selection. Natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous, which consequently endure. But as from the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings, each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows that as each selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the less favoured forms decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction. We can, also, see that any form represented by few individuals will, during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction. But we may go further than this; for as new forms are continually and slowly being produced, unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing, numbers inevitably must become extinct. That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased, geology shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why they should not have thus increased, for the number of places in the polity of nature is not indefinitely great,—not that we have any means of knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species. Probably no region is as yet fully stocked, for at the Cape of Good Hope, where more species of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the world, some foreign plants have become naturalised, without causing, as far as we know, the extinction of any natives.

Furthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals will have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations. We have evidence of this, in the facts given in the second chapter, showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded varieties, or incipient species. Hence, rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period, and they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species.

From these several considerations I think it inevitably follows, that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection, others will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. The forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement, will naturally suffer most. And we have seen in the chapter on the Struggle for Existence that it is the most closely-allied forms,—varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus or of related genera,—which, from having nearly the same structure, constitution, and habits, generally come into the severest competition with each other. Consequently, each new variety or species, during the progress of its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred, and tend to exterminate them. We see the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated productions, through the selection of improved forms by man. Many curious instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle, sheep, and other animals, and varieties of flowers, take the place of older and inferior kinds. In Yorkshire, it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the long-horns, and that these “were swept away by the short-horns” (I quote the words of an agricultural writer) “as if by some murderous pestilence.”




Divergence of Character.—The principle, which I have designated by this term, is of high importance on my theory, and explains, as I believe, several important facts. In the first place, varieties, even strongly-marked ones, though having somewhat of the character of species—as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them—yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species. Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species in the process of formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient species. How, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species? That this does habitually happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas varieties, the supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked species, present slight and ill-defined differences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents, and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus.

As has always been my practice, let us seek light on this head from our domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. A fancier is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged principle that “fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard, but like extremes,” they both go on (as has actually occurred with tumbler-pigeons) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we may suppose that at an early period one man preferred swifter horses; another stronger and more bulky horses. The early differences would be very slight; in the course of time, from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders, and of stronger ones by others, the differences would become greater, and would be noted as forming two sub-breeds; finally, after the lapse of centuries, the sub-breeds would become converted into two well-established and distinct breeds. As the differences slowly become greater, the inferior animals with intermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very strong, will have been neglected, and will have tended to disappear. Here, then, we see in man's productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence, causing differences, at first barely appreciable, steadily to increase, and the breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their common parent.

But how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I believe it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers.

We can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits. Take the case of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average. If its natural powers of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in increasing (the country not undergoing any change in its conditions) only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals: some of them, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead or alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting water, and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. The more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became, the more places they would be enabled to occupy. What applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animals—that is, if they vary—for otherwise natural selection can do nothing. So it will be with plants. It has been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be raised. The same has been found to hold good when first one variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground. Hence, if any one species of grass were to go on varying, and those varieties were continually selected which differed from each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses differ from each other, a greater number of individual plants of this species of grass, including its modified descendants, would succeed in living on the same piece of ground. And we well know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and thus, as it may be said, is striving its utmost to increase its numbers. Consequently, I cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of generations, the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when rendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species.

The truth of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many natural circumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if freely open to immigration, and where the contest between individual and individual must be severe, we always find great diversity in its inhabitants. For instance, I found that a piece of turf, three feet by four in size, which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same conditions, supported twenty species of plants, and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders, which shows how much these plants differed from each other. So it is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets; and so in small ponds of fresh water. Farmers find that they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation. Most of the animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground, could live on it (supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature), and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there; but, it is seen, that where they come into the closest competition with each other, the advantages of diversification of structure, with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each other most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call different genera and orders.

The same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man's agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country. It might, also, perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes. But the case is very different; and Alph. De Candolle has well remarked in his great and admirable work, that floras gain by naturalisation, proportionally with the number of the native genera and species, far more in new genera than in new species. To give a single instance: in the last edition of Dr. Asa Gray's “Manual of the Flora of the Northern United States,” 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and these belong to 162 genera. We thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature. They differ, moreover, to a large extent from the indigenes, for out of the 162 genera, no less than 100 genera are not there indigenous, and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of these States.

By considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled successfully with the indigenes of any country, and have there become naturalised, we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives would have had to be modified, in order to have gained an advantage over the other natives; and we may, I think, at least safely infer that diversification of structure, amounting to new generic differences, would have been profitable to them.

The advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is, in fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual body—a subject so well elucidated by Milne Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted to digest vegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from these substances. So in the general economy of any land, the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting themselves. A set of animals, with their organisation but little diversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure. It may be doubted, for instance, whether the Australian marsupials, which are divided into groups differing but little from each other, and feebly representing, as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked, our carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully compete with these well-pronounced orders. In the Australian mammals, we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development.

After the foregoing discussion, which ought to have been much amplified, we may, I think, assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. Now let us see how this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence of character, combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction, will tend to act.

The accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather perplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a genus large in its own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances. I have said a large genus, because we have seen in the second chapter, that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small genera; and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties. We have, also, seen that the species, which are the commonest and the most widely-diffused, vary more than rare species with restricted ranges. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying species, belonging to a genus large in its own country. The little fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may represent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed to be extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of time; nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods. Only those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected. And here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character comes in; for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines) being preserved and accumulated by natural selection. When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work.



The intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent each a thousand generations; but it would have been better if each had represented ten thousand generations. After a thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked varieties, namely a1 and m1. These two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable, and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary, consequently they will tend to vary, and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their parents varied. Moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their common parent (A) more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country; they will likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parent- species belonged, a large genus in its own country. And these circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new varieties.

If, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand generations. And after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing to the principle of divergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a1. Variety m1 is supposed to have produced two varieties, namely m2 and s2 , differing from each other, and more considerably from their common parent (A). We may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some of the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only a single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some producing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any. Thus the varieties or modified descendants, proceeding from the common parent (A), will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character. In the diagram the process is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation, and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth generation.

But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made somewhat irregular. I am far from thinking that the most divergent varieties will invariably prevail and multiply: a medium form may often long endure, and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant; for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings; and this will depend on infinitely complex relations. But as a general rule, the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more their modified progeny will be increased. In our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties. But these breaks are imaginary, and might have been inserted anywhere, after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation.

As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character: this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from (A). The modified offspring from the later and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable, often take the place of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved branches: this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines. In some cases I do not doubt that the process of modification will be confined to a single line of descent, and the number of the descendants will not be increased; although the amount of divergent modification may have been increased in the successive generations. This case would be represented in the diagram, if all the lines proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from a1 to a10. In the same way, for instance, the English race-horse and English pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or races.

After ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced three forms, a10, f10, and m10, which, from having diverged in character during the successive generations, will have come to differ largely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common parent. If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked varieties; or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of sub-species; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these three forms into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species. By continuing the same process for a greater number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the letters between a14 and m14, all descended from (A). Thus, as I believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed.

In a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary. In the diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced, by analogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked varieties (w10 and z10) or two species, according to the amount of change supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines. After fourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters n14 to z14, are supposed to have been produced. In each genus, the species, which are already extremely different in character, will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants; for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species (A), and the nearly extreme species (I), as those which have largely varied, and have given rise to new varieties and species. The other nine species (marked by capital letters) of our original genus, may for a long period continue transmitting unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space.

But during the process of modification, represented in the diagram, another of our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played an important part. As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent. For it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits, constitution, and structure. Hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states, that is between the less and more improved state of a species, as well as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become extinct. So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent. If, however, the modified offspring of a species get into some distinct country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in which child and parent do not come into competition, both may continue to exist.

If then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of modification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct, having been replaced by eight new species (a14 to m14); and (I) will have been replaced by six (n14 to z14) new species.

But we may go further than this. The original species of our genus were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and D, than to the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than to the others. These two species (A) and (I), were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species, so that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus. Their modified descendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth generation, will probably have inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country. It seems, therefore, to me extremely probable that they will have taken the places of, and thus exterminated, not only their parents (A) and (I), but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly related to their parents. Hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation. We may suppose that only one (F), of the two species which were least closely related to the other nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent.

The new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species, will now be fifteen in number. Owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection, the extreme amount of difference in character between species a14 and z14 will be much greater than that between the most different of the original eleven species. The new species, moreover, will be allied to each other in a widely different manner. Of the eight descendants from (A) the three marked a14, q14, p14, will be nearly related from having recently branched off from a10; b14 and f14, from having diverged at an earlier period from a5, will be in some degree distinct from the three first-named species; and lastly, o14, e14, and m14, will be nearly related one to the other, but from having diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification, will be widely different from the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or even a distinct genus.

The six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or even genera. But as the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly at the extreme points of the original genus, the six descendants from (I) will, owing to inheritance, differ considerably from the eight descendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have gone on diverging in different directions. The intermediate species, also (and this is a very important consideration), which connected the original species (A) and (I), have all become, excepting (F), extinct, and have left no descendants. Hence the six new species descended from (I), and the eight descended from (A), will have to be ranked as very distinct genera, or even as distinct sub-families.

Thus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by descent, with modification, from two or more species of the same genus. And the two or more parent-species are supposed to have descended from some one species of an earlier genus. In our diagram, this is indicated by the broken lines, beneath the capital letters, converging in sub-branches downwards towards a single point; this point representing a single species, the supposed single parent of our several new sub-genera and genera.

It is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new species F14, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character, but to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree. In this case, its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Having descended from a form which stood between the two parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed to be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these species. But as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents, the new species (F14) will not be directly intermediate between them, but rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind.

In the diagram, each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to represent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or hundred million generations, and likewise a section of the successive strata of the earth's crust including extinct remains. We shall, when we come to our chapter on Geology, have to refer again to this subject, and I think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the same orders, or families, or genera, with those now living, yet are often, in some degree, intermediate in character between existing groups; and we can understand this fact, for the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less.

I see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained, to the formation of genera alone. If, in our diagram, we suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be very great, the forms marked a14 to p14, those marked b14 and f14, and those marked o14 to m14, will form three very distinct genera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (I); and as these latter two genera, both from continued divergence of character and from inheritance from a different parent, will differ widely from the three genera descended from (A), the two little groups of genera will form two distinct families, or even orders, according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram. And the two new families, or orders, will have descended from two species of the original genus; and these two species are supposed to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown genus.

We have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species. This, indeed, might have been expected; for as natural selection acts through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence, it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage; and the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common. Hence, the struggle for the production of new and modified descendants, will mainly lie between the larger groups, which are all trying to increase in number. One large group will slowly conquer another large group, reduce its numbers, and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement. Within the same large group, the later and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of Nature, will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups. Small and broken groups and sub-groups will finally tend to disappear. Looking to the future, we can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant, and which are least broken up, that is, which as yet have suffered least extinction, will for a long period continue to increase. But which groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we well know that many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become extinct. Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict that, owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no modified descendants; and consequently that of the species living at any one period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity. I shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on Classification, but I may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species having transmitted descendants, and on the view of all the descendants of the same species making a class, we can understand how it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Although extremely few of the most ancient species may now have living and modified descendants, yet at the most remote geological period, the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many genera, families, orders, and classes, as at the present day.




Summary of Chapter.—If during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life, organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation, and I think this cannot be disputed; if there be, owing to the high geometrical powers of increase of each species, at some age, season, or year, a severe struggle for life, and this certainly cannot be disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence, causing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be advantageous to them, I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being's own welfare, in the same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised. This principle of preservation, I have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection. Natural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young, as easily as the adult. Amongst many animals, sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection, by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone, in their struggles with other males.

Whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations, must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters. But we already see how it entails extinction; and how largely extinction has acted in the world's history, geology plainly declares. Natural selection, also, leads to divergence of character; for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure, habits, and constitution, of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants of any small spot or at naturalised productions. Therefore during the modification of the descendants of any one species, and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers, the more diversified these descendants become, the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle of life. Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species, will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.

We have seen that it is the common, the widely-diffused, and widely-ranging species, belonging to the larger genera, which vary most; and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries. Natural selection, as has just been remarked, leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life. On these principles, I believe, the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be explained. It is a truly wonderful fact—the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity—that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group, in the manner which we everywhere behold—namely, varieties of the same species most closely related together, species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera, species of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in different degrees, forming sub-families, families, orders, sub-classes, and classes. The several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file, but seem rather to be clustered round points, and these round other points, and so on in almost endless cycles. On the view that each species has been independently created, I can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings; but, to the best of my judgment, it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and divergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.

The affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified descendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living representatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state. As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the Ornithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds give rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications.





CHAPTER V　LAWS OF VARIATION


Effects of external conditions—Use and disuse, combined with natural selection; organs of flight and of vision—Acclimatisation— Correlation of growth—Compensation and economy of growth— False correlations— Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures variable—Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable: specific characters more variable than generic: secondary sexual characters variable—Species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner—Reversions to long lost characters— Summary

I have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations—so common and multiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in those in a state of nature—had been due to chance. This, of course, is a wholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences, or very slight deviations of structure, as to make the child like its parents. But the much greater variability, as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities, under domestication or cultivation, than under nature, leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions of life, to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several generations. I have remarked in the first chapter—but a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the truth of the remark—that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; and to this system being functionally disturbed in the parents, I chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring. The male and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new being. In the case of “sporting” plants, the bud, which in its earliest condition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule, is alone affected. But why, because the reproductive system is disturbed, this or that part should vary more or less, we are profoundly ignorant. Nevertheless, we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light, and we may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of structure, however slight.

How much direct effect difference of climate, food, etc., produces on any being is extremely doubtful. My impression is, that the effect is extremely small in the case of animals, but perhaps rather more in that of plants. We may, at least, safely conclude that such influences cannot have produced the many striking and complex co-adaptations of structure between one organic being and another, which we see everywhere throughout nature. Some little influence may be attributed to climate, food, etc.: thus, E. Forbes speaks confidently that shells at their southern limit, and when living in shallow water, are more brightly coloured than those of the same species further north or from greater depths. Gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when living on islands or near the coast. So with insects, Wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects their colours. Moquin-Tandon gives a list of plants which when growing near the sea-shore have their leaves in some degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. Several other such cases could be given.

The fact of varieties of one species, when they range into the zone of habitation of other species, often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the characters of such species, accords with our view that species of all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties. Thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally brighter-coloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas. The birds which are confined to continents are, according to Mr. Gould, brighter-coloured than those of islands. The insect-species confined to sea-coasts, as every collector knows, are often brassy or lurid. Plants which live exclusively on the sea-side are very apt to have fleshy leaves. He who believes in the creation of each species, will have to say that this shell, for instance, was created with bright colours for a warm sea; but that this other shell became bright-coloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters.

When a variation is of the slightest use to a being, we cannot tell how much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection, and how much to the conditions of life. Thus, it is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more severe the climate is under which they have lived; but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the direct action of the severe climate? for it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.

Instances could be given of the same variety being produced under conditions of life as different as can well be conceived; and, on the other hand, of different varieties being produced from the same species under the same conditions. Such facts show how indirectly the conditions of life must act. Again, innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of species keeping true, or not varying at all, although living under the most opposite climates. Such considerations as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of the conditions of life. Indirectly, as already remarked, they seem to play an important part in affecting the reproductive system, and in thus inducing variability; and natural selection will then accumulate all profitable variations, however slight, until they become plainly developed and appreciable by us.




Effects of Use and Disuse.—From the facts alluded to in the first chapter, I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and that such modifications are inherited. Under free nature, we can have no standard of comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued use or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals have structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor Owen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of South America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck. As the larger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, I believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no beast of prey, has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight, but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any of the smaller quadrupeds. We may imagine that the early progenitor of the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of its body, its legs were used more, and its wings less, until they became incapable of flight.

Kirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior tarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are very often broken off; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had even a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost, that the insect has been described as not having them. In some other genera they are present, but in a rudimentary condition. In the Ateuchus or sacred beetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient. There is not sufficient evidence to induce us to believe that mutilations are ever inherited; and I should prefer explaining the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some other genera, by the long-continued effects of disuse in their progenitors; for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many dung-feeding beetles, they must be lost early in life, and therefore cannot be much used by these insects.

In some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure which are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection. Mr. Wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of the 550 species inhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and that of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less than twenty-three genera have all their species in this condition! Several facts, namely, that beetles in many parts of the world are very frequently blown to sea and perish; that the beetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much concealed, until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Dezertas than in Madeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted on by Mr. Wollaston, of the almost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, and which groups have habits of life almost necessitating frequent flight;—these several considerations have made me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection, but combined probably with disuse. For during thousands of successive generations each individual beetle which flew least, either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other hand, those beetles which most readily took to flight will oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed.

The insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as the flower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use their wings to gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects, their wings not at all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite compatible with the action of natural selection. For when a new insect first arrived on the island, the tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings, would depend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds, or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying. As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast, it would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further, whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck.

The eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size, and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. This state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by natural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or Ctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was assured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently blind; one which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause, as appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal, and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with subterranean habits, a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage; and if so, natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse.

It is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different classes, which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky, are blind. In some of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is gone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its glasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though useless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, I attribute their loss wholly to disuse. In one of the blind animals, namely, the cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and Professor Silliman thought that it regained, after living some days in the light, some slight power of vision. In the same manner as in Madeira the wings of some of the insects have been enlarged, and the wings of others have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse, so in the case of the cave-rat natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and to have increased the size of the eyes; whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves, disuse by itself seems to have done its work.

It is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the common view of the blind animals having been separately created for the American and European caverns, close similarity in their organisation and affinities might have been expected; but, as Schiödte and others have remarked, this is not the case, and the cave-insects of the two continents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated from the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of North America and Europe. On my view we must suppose that American animals, having ordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, as did European animals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence of this gradation of habit; for, as Schiödte remarks, “animals not far remote from ordinary forms, prepare the transition from light to darkness. Next follow those that are constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those destined for total darkness.” By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for blindness. Notwithstanding such modifications, we might expect still to see in the cave-animals of America, affinities to the other inhabitants of that continent, and in those of Europe, to the inhabitants of the European continent. And this is the case with some of the American cave-animals, as I hear from Professor Dana; and some of the European cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding country. It would be most difficult to give any rational explanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation. That several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New Worlds should be closely related, we might expect from the well-known relationship of most of their other productions. Far from feeling any surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark abodes will probably have been exposed.




Acclimatisation.—Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, in the time of sleep, etc., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation. As it is extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and very cold countries, and as I believe that all the species of the same genus have descended from a single parent, if this view be correct, acclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued descent. It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live is often overrated. We may infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health. We have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as, or more than, by adaptation to particular climates. But whether or not the adaptation be generally very close, we have evidence, in the case of some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures, or becoming acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed collected by Dr. Hooker from trees growing at different heights on the Himalaya, were found in this country to possess different constitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in Ceylon, and analogous observations have been made by Mr. H. C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the Azores to England. In regard to animals, several authentic cases could be given of species within historical times having largely extended their range from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes.

As I believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by uncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable of far-extended transportation, I think the common and extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates but of being perfectly fertile (a far severer test) under them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals, now in a state of nature, could easily be brought to bear widely different climates. We must not, however, push the foregoing argument too far, on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several wild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. The rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals, but they have been transported by man to many parts of the world, and now have a far wider range than any other rodent, living free under the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the Falklands in the south, and on many islands in the torrid zones. Hence I am inclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which is common to most animals. On this view, the capacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and such facts as that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into play.

How much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions, and how much to both means combined, is a very obscure question. That habit or custom has some influence I must believe, both from analogy, and from the incessant advice given in agricultural works, even in the ancient Encyclopaedias of China, to be very cautious in transposing animals from one district to another; for it is not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts: the result must, I think, be due to habit. On the other hand, I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve those individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries. In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others: this is very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern, and others for the southern States; and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional differences to habit. The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never propagated by seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced, has even been advanced—for it is now as tender as ever it was—as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! The case, also, of the kidney- bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much greater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations, his kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to prevent accidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the same precautions, the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried. Nor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling kidney-beans ever appear, for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than others.

On the whole, I think we may conclude that habit, use, and disuse, have, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of innate differences.




Correlation of Growth.—I mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied together during its growth and development, that when slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through natural selection, other parts become modified. This is a very important subject, most imperfectly understood. The most obvious case is, that modifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva, will, it may safely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously affects the whole organisation of the adult. The several parts of the body which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are alike, seem liable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.

Homologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere; this is often seen in monstrous plants; and nothing is more common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures, as the union of the petals of the corolla into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that the diversity in the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of their kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child. In snakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera.

The nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure. M. Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain malconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist, without our being able to assign any reason. What can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tortoise-shell colour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons, and the presence of more or less down on the young birds when first hatched, with the future colour of their plumage; or, again, the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here probably homology comes into play? With respect to this latter case of correlation, I think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal coverings, viz. Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly ant-eaters, etc.), that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth.

I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation in modifying important structures, independently of utility and, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants. Every one knows the difference in the ray and central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower. But, in some Compositous plants, the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture; and even the ovary itself, with its accessory parts, differs, as has been described by Cassini. These differences have been attributed by some authors to pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets in some Compositae countenances this idea; but, in the case of the corolla of the Umbelliferae, it is by no means, as Dr. Hooker informs me, in species with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most frequently differ. It might have been thought that the development of the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of the flower had caused their abortion; but in some Compositae there is a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any difference in the corolla. Possibly, these several differences may be connected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central and external flowers: we know, at least, that in irregular flowers, those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria, and become regular. I may add, as an instance of this, and of a striking case of correlation, that I have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums, that the central flower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two upper petals; and that when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite aborted; when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals, the nectary is only much shortened.

With respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel, I do not feel at all sure that C. C. Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of these two orders, is so far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be advantageous, natural selection may have come into play. But in regard to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds, which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance—the seeds being in some cases, according to Tausch, orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers,—that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences. Hence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of high value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and without being, as far as we can see, of the slightest service to the species.

We may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to inheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and independent modification; and these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be correlated in some necessary manner. So, again, I do not doubt that some apparent correlations, occurring throughout whole orders, are entirely due to the manner alone in which natural selection can act. For instance, Alph. De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open: I should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection, except in fruits which opened; so that the individual plants producing seeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further, might get an advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal; and this process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open.

The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same period, their law of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed it, “in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on the other side.” I think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in our fruits become atrophied, the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality. In our poultry, a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb, and a large beard by diminished wattles. With species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application; but many good observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. I will not, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part.

I suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been advanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more general principle, namely, that natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation. If under changed conditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful, any diminution, however slight, in its development, will be seized on by natural selection, for it will profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up an useless structure. I can thus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given: namely, that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace. This is the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas: for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly-important anterior segments of the head enormously developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles; but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile antennae. Now the saving of a large and complex structure, when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the Proteolepas, though effected by slow steps, would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species; for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed, each individual Proteolepas would have a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted in developing a structure now become useless.

Thus, as I believe, natural selection will always succeed in the long run in reducing and saving every part of the organisation, as soon as it is rendered superfluous, without by any means causing some other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree. And, conversely, that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ, without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some adjoining part.

It seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both in varieties and in species, that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the structure of the same individual (as the vertebrae in snakes, and the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the number of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers, is constant. The same author and some botanists have further remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure. Inasmuch as this “vegetative repetition,” to use Professor Owen's expression, seems to be a sign of low organisation; the foregoing remark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists, that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which are higher. I presume that lowness in this case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same part has to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain variable, that is, why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for one special purpose alone. In the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for some particular object had better be of some particular shape. Natural selection, it should never be forgotten, can act on each part of each being, solely through and for its advantage.

Rudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and I believe with truth, are apt to be highly variable. We shall have to recur to the general subject of rudimentary and aborted organs; and I will here only add that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness, and therefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure. Thus rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws of growth, to the effects of long-continued disuse, and to the tendency to reversion.




A part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner, in comparison with the same part in allied species, tends to be highly variable.—Several years ago I was much struck with a remark, nearly to the above effect, published by Mr. Waterhouse. I infer also from an observation made by Professor Owen, with respect to the length of the arms of the ourang-outang, that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion. It is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition without giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which cannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes of error, but I hope that I have made due allowance for them. It should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part, however unusually developed, unless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in closely allied species. Thus, the bat's wing is a most abnormal structure in the class mammalia; but the rule would not here apply, because there is a whole group of bats having wings; it would apply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus. The rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner. The term, secondary sexual characters, used by Hunter, applies to characters which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction. The rule applies to males and females; but as females more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters, it applies more rarely to them. The rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great variability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual manner—of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes; and I may here add, that I particularly attended to Mr. Waterhouse's remark, whilst investigating this Order, and I am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with cirripedes. I shall, in my future work, give a list of the more remarkable cases; I will here only briefly give one, as it illustrates the rule in its largest application. The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock barnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very important structures, and they differ extremely little even in different genera; but in the several species of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification: the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so great, that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the characters of these important valves than do other species of distinct genera.

As birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree, I have particularly attended to them, and the rule seems to me certainly to hold good in this class. I cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability.

When we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in any species, the fair presumption is that it is of high importance to that species; nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to variation. Why should this be so? On the view that each species has been independently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see no explanation. But on the view that groups of species have descended from other species, and have been modified through natural selection, I think we can obtain some light. In our domestic animals, if any part, or the whole animal, be neglected and no selection be applied, that part (for instance, the comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a nearly uniform character. The breed will then be said to have degenerated. In rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little specialised for any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic groups, we see a nearly parallel natural case; for in such cases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play, and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition. But what here more especially concerns us is, that in our domestic animals those points, which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued selection, are also eminently liable to variation. Look at the breeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers, in the beak and wattle of the different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our fantails, etc., these being the points now mainly attended to by English fanciers. Even in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is notoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and frequently individuals are born which depart widely from the standard. There may be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the tendency to reversion to a less modified state, as well as an innate tendency to further variability of all kinds, and, on the other hand, the power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In the long run selection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short- faced strain. But as long as selection is rapidly going on, there may always be expected to be much variability in the structure undergoing modification. It further deserves notice that these variable characters, produced by man's selection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown to us, more to one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.

Now let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an extraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species of the same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an extraordinary amount of modification, since the period when the species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus. This period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species very rarely endure for more than one geological period. An extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and long-continued amount of variability, which has continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species. But as the variability of the extraordinarily-developed part or organ has been so great and long-continued within a period not excessively remote, we might, as a general rule, expect still to find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation, which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant. And this, I am convinced, is the case. That the struggle between natural selection on the one hand, and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand, will in the course of time cease; and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant, I can see no reason to doubt. Hence when an organ, however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to many modified descendants, as in the case of the wing of the bat, it must have existed, according to my theory, for an immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it comes to be no more variable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the generative variability, as it may be called, still present in a high degree. For in this case the variability will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals varying in the required manner and degree, and by the continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition.

The principle included in these remarks may be extended. It is notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic. To explain by a simple example what is meant. If some species in a large genus of plants had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become a generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance. I have chosen this example because an explanation is not in this case applicable, which most naturalists would advance, namely, that specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet only indirectly, true; I shall, however, have to return to this subject in our chapter on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement, that specific characters are more variable than generic; but I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author has remarked with surprise that some important organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout large groups of species, has differed considerably in closely-allied species, that it has, also, been variable in the individuals of some of the species. And this fact shows that a character, which is generally of generic value, when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value, often becomes variable, though its physiological importance may remain the same. Something of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire seems to entertain no doubt, that the more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same group, the more subject it is to individual anomalies.

On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should that part of the structure, which differs from the same part in other independently-created species of the same genus, be more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several species? I do not see that any explanation can be given. But on the view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come to differ. Or to state the case in another manner:—the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from the species of some other genus, are called generic characters; and these characters in common I attribute to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several species, fitted to more or less widely-different habits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited from a remote period, since that period when the species first branched off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day. On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus, are called specific characters; and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the species from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable,—at least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant.

In connexion with the present subject, I will make only two other remarks. I think it will be admitted, without my entering on details, that secondary sexual characters are very variable; I think it also will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation; compare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed, with the amount of difference between their females; and the truth of this proposition will be granted. The cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest; but we can see why these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation; for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males. Whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly variable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may thus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their sexual characters, than in other parts of their structure.

It is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences between the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus differ from each other. Of this fact I will give in illustration two instances, the first which happen to stand on my list; and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can hardly be accidental. The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles, but in the Engidae, as Westwood has remarked, the number varies greatly; and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species: again in fossorial hymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance, because common to large groups; but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species, and likewise in the two sexes of the same species. This relation has a clear meaning on my view of the subject: I look at all the species of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two sexes of any one of the species. Consequently, whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable; variations of this part would, it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection, in order to fit the several species to their several places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same species to each other, or to fit the males and females to different habits of life, or the males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females.

Finally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific characters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of generic characters, or those which the species possess in common;—that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners; and the not great degree of variability in a part, however extraordinarily it may be developed, if it be common to a whole group of species;—that the great variability of secondary sexual characters, and the great amount of difference in these same characters between closely allied species;—that secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the organisation,—are all principles closely connected together. All being mainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited much in common,—to parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not varied,—to natural selection having more or less completely, according to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability,—to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection,—and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection, and thus adapted for secondary sexual, and for ordinary specific purposes.




Distinct species present analogous variations; and a variety of one species often assumes some of the characters of an allied species, or reverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor.—These propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic races. The most distinct breeds of pigeons, in countries most widely apart, present sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on the feet,—characters not possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct races. The frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter, may be considered as a variation representing the normal structure of another race, the fantail. I presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted on by similar unknown influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or roots as commonly called, of the Swedish turnip and Ruta baga, plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so, the case will then be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct species; and to these a third may be added, namely, the common turnip. According to the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants, not to the vera causa of community of descent, and a consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation.

With pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional appearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars on the wings, a white rump, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these marks are characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds. We may I think confidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.

No doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after having been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations. But when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed for many generations—some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations. After twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a common expression, of any one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been crossed, but in which both parents have lost some character which their progenitor possessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost character might be, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to the contrary, transmitted for almost any number of generations. When a character which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of generations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations distant, but that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in question, which at last, under unknown favourable conditions, gains an ascendancy. For instance, it is probable that in each generation of the barb-pigeon, which produces most rarely a blue and black-barred bird, there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume this colour. This view is hypothetical, but could be supported by some facts; and I can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of generations, than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we all know them to be, thus inherited. Indeed, we may sometimes observe a mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance, in the common snapdragon (Antirrhinum) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears, that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it.

As all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to have descended from a common parent, it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of one species would resemble in some of its characters another species; this other species being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety. But characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the presence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection, in accordance with the diverse habits of the species, and will not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited constitution. It might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters. As, however, we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a group, we could not distinguish these two cases: if, for instance, we did not know that the rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned, we could not have told, whether these characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of reversion, from the number of the markings, which are correlated with the blue tint, and which it does not appear probable would all appear together from simple variation. More especially we might have inferred this, from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed. Hence, though under nature it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are reversions to an anciently existing character, and what are new but analogous variations, yet we ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species assuming characters (either from reversion or from analogous variation) which already occur in some other members of the same group. And this undoubtedly is the case in nature.

A considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in our systematic works, is due to its varieties mocking, as it were, some of the other species of the same genus. A considerable catalogue, also, could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms, which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species; and this shows, unless all these forms be considered as independently created species, that the one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other, so as to produce the intermediate form. But the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire, in some degree, the character of the same part or organ in an allied species. I have collected a long list of such cases; but here, as before, I lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give them. I can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur, and seem to me very remarkable.

I will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as affecting any important character, but from occurring in several species of the same genus, partly under domestication and partly under nature. It is a case apparently of reversion. The ass not rarely has very distinct transverse bars on its legs, like those on the legs of the zebra: it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal, and from inquiries which I have made, I believe this to be true. It has also been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double. The shoulder-stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline. A white ass, but not an albino, has been described without either spinal or shoulder-stripe; and these stripes are sometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. The koulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe. The hemionus has no shoulder-stripe; but traces of it, as stated by Mr. Blyth and others, occasionally appear: and I have been informed by Colonel Poole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs, and faintly on the shoulder. The quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra over the body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks.

With respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of all colours; transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one instance in a chestnut: a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in duns, and I have seen a trace in a bay horse. My son made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes; and a man, whom I can implicitly trust, has examined for me a small dun Welch pony with three short parallel stripes on each shoulder.

In the north-west part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so generally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined the breed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not considered as purely-bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are generally barred; and the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double and sometimes treble, is common; the side of the face, moreover, is sometimes striped. The stripes are plainest in the foal; and sometimes quite disappear in old horses. Colonel Poole has seen both gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first foaled. I have, also, reason to suspect, from information given me by Mr. W. W. Edwards, that with the English race-horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the full-grown animal. Without here entering on further details, I may state that I have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds, in various countries from Britain to Eastern China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay Archipelago in the south. In all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is included, from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream-colour.

I am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this subject, believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several aboriginal species—one of which, the dun, was striped; and that the above-described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with the dun stock. But I am not at all satisfied with this theory, and should be loth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy Belgian cart-horse, Welch ponies, cobs, the lanky Kattywar race, etc., inhabiting the most distant parts of the world.

Now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the horse-genus. Rollin asserts, that the common mule from the ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs. I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra; and Mr. W. C. Martin, in his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of a similar mule. In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids between the ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. In Lord Moreton's famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the hybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most remarkable case, a hybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs me that he knows of a second case) from the ass and the hemionus; and this hybrid, though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder-stripe, nevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short shoulder-stripes, like those on the dun Welch pony, and even had some zebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. With respect to this last fact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an accident, that I was led solely from the occurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus, to ask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occur in the eminently striped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the affirmative.

What now are we to say to these several facts? We see several very distinct species of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the legs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. In the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears—a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the genus. The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character. We see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct species. Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons: they are descended from a pigeon (including two or three sub-species or geographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars and other marks; and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars and other marks invariably reappear; but without any other change of form or character. When the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels. I have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters, is—that there is a tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce the long-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes, sometimes prevails. And we have just seen that in several species of the horse-genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in the old. Call the breeds of pigeons, some of which have bred true for centuries, species; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse-genus! For myself, I venture confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like a zebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common parent of our domestic horse, whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks, of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.

He who believes that each equine species was independently created, will, I presume, assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary, both under nature and under domestication, in this particular manner, so as often to become striped like other species of the genus; and that each has been created with a strong tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world, to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes, not their own parents, but other species of the genus. To admit this view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at least for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and deception; I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.




Summary.—Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part differs, more or less, from the same part in the parents. But whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same species, and the greater differences between species of the same genus. The external conditions of life, as climate and food, etc., seem to have induced some slight modifications. Habit in producing constitutional differences, and use in strengthening, and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs, seem to have been more potent in their effects. Homologous parts tend to vary in the same way, and homologous parts tend to cohere. Modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts. When one part is largely developed, perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts; and every part of the structure which can be saved without detriment to the individual, will be saved. Changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts subsequently developed; and there are very many other correlations of growth, the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand. Multiple parts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely specialised to any particular function, so that their modifications have not been closely checked by natural selection. It is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole organisation more specialised, and are higher in the scale. Rudimentary organs, from being useless, will be disregarded by natural selection, and hence probably are variable. Specific characters—that is, the characters which have come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent—are more variable than generic characters, or those which have long been inherited, and have not differed within this same period. In these remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still variable, because they have recently varied and thus come to differ; but we have also seen in the second Chapter that the same principle applies to the whole individual; for in a district where many species of any genus are found—that is, where there has been much former variation and differentiation, or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at work—there, on an average, we now find most varieties or incipient species. Secondary sexual characters are highly variable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same group. Variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the same species, and specific differences to the several species of the same genus. Any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts; for variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state. But when a species with any extraordinarily-developed organ has become the parent of many modified descendants—which on my view must be a very slow process, requiring a long lapse of time—in this case, natural selection may readily have succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however extraordinary a manner it may be developed. Species inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences will naturally tend to present analogous variations, and these same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient progenitors. Although new and important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous variation, such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.

Whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents—and a cause for each must exist—it is the steady accumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when beneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure, by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other, and the best adapted to survive.





CHAPTER VI　DIFFICULTIES ON THEORY


Difficulties on the theory of descent with modification— Transitions—Absence or rarity of transitional varieties—Transitions in habits of life—Diversified habits in the same species—Species with habits widely different from those of their allies—Organs of extreme perfection—Means of transition—Cases of difficulty— Natura non facit saltum—Organs of small importance—Organs not in all cases absolutely perfect—The law of Unity of Type and of the Conditions of Existence embraced by the theory of Natural Selection

Long before having arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of difficulties will have occurred to the reader. Some of them are so grave that to this day I can never reflect on them without being staggered; but, to the best of my judgment, the greater number are only apparent, and those that are real are not, I think, fatal to my theory.

These difficulties and objections may be classed under the following heads:—Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being, as we see them, well defined?

Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, organs of such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection?

Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection? What shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which leads the bee to make cells, which have practically anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians?

Fourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile and producing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed, their fertility is unimpaired?

The two first heads shall be here discussed—Instinct and Hybridism in separate chapters.




On the absence or rarity of transitional varieties.—As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent or other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition. Thus extinction and natural selection will, as we have seen, go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some other unknown form, both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the new form.

But, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed, why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth? It will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the Imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting profound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides. These contingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals. Whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little sediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological history. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote.

But it may be urged that when several closely-allied species inhabit the same territory we surely ought to find at the present time many transitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals with closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land. These representative species often meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and rarer, the other becomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces the other. But if we compare these species where they intermingle, they are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each. By my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states. Hence we ought not to expect at the present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each region, though they must have existed there, and may be embedded there in a fossil condition. But in the intermediate region, having intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find closely-linking intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time quite confounded me. But I think it can be in large part explained.

In the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because an area is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long period. Geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones. By changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present. But I will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas; though I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the formation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals.

In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area, we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally disappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two representative species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to each. We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes it is quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. De Candolle has observed, a common alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by Forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly. But when we bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species; that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others; in short, that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic beings, we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on the presence of other species, on which it depends, or by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes into competition; and as these species are already defined objects (however they may have become so), not blending one into another by insensible gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the range of others, will tend to be sharply defined. Moreover, each species on the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in the seasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination; and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply defined.

If I am right in believing that allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that each has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to both; and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from information given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston, that generally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then, I think, we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods;—why as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.

For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers; and in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it. But a far more important consideration, as I believe, is that, during the process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. For forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved. It is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the common species in each country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on an average a greater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer species. I may illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill-variety.

To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are very slowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural selection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants. And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other. So that, in any one region and at any one time, we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and this assuredly we do see.

Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent period in isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially amongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species. In this case, intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent, must formerly have existed in each broken portion of the land, but these links will have been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural selection, so that they will no longer exist in a living state.

Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but they will generally have had a short duration. For these intermediate varieties will, from reasons already assigned (namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species, and likewise of acknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect. From this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination; and during the process of further modification through natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect; for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate, present more variation, and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.

Lastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the species of the same group together, must assuredly have existed; but the very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links. Consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains, which are preserved, as we shall in a future chapter attempt to show, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record.




On the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and structure.—It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold, how, for instance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state have subsisted? It would be easy to show that within the same group carnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each exists by a struggle for life, it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place in nature. Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail; during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys like other polecats on mice and land animals. If a different case had been taken, and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult, and I could have given no answer. Yet I think such difficulties have very little weight.

Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for out of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species of the same genus; and of diversified habits, either constant or occasional, in the same species. And it seems to me that nothing less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular case like that of the bat.

Look at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from animals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as Sir J. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the so-called flying squirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree. We cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more quickly, or, as there is reason to believe, by lessening the danger from occasional falls. But it does not follow from this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive under all natural conditions. Let the climate and vegetation change, let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated, unless they also became modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no difficulty, more especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes, each modification being useful, each being propagated, until by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect so-called flying squirrel was produced.

Now look at the Galeopithecus or flying lemur, which formerly was falsely ranked amongst bats. It has an extremely wide flank-membrane, stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail, and including the limbs and the elongated fingers: the flank-membrane is, also, furnished with an extensor muscle. Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding through the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other Lemuridae, yet I can see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that each had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels; and that each grade of structure had been useful to its possessor. Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membrane-connected fingers and fore-arm of the Galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection; and this, as far as the organs of flight are concerned, would convert it into a bat. In bats which have the wing-membrane extended from the top of the shoulder to the tail, including the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight.

If about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown, who would have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which used their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck (Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and front legs on the land, like the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no purpose, like the Apteryx. Yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has to live by a struggle; but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions. It must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all have resulted from disuse, indicate the natural steps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight; but they serve, at least, to show what diversified means of transition are possible.

Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land, and seeing that we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified into perfectly winged animals. If this had been effected, who would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively, as far as we know, to escape being devoured by other fish?

When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit, as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to exist to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection. Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms. Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water, until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less, from their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of species with fully developed structures.

I will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits in the individuals of the same species. When either case occurs, it would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal, by some modification of its structure, for its changed habits, or exclusively for one of its several different habits. But it is difficult to tell, and immaterial for us, whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both probably often change almost simultaneously. Of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many British insects which now feed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial substances. Of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given: I have often watched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in South America, hovering over one spot and then proceeding to another, like a kestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water, and then dashing like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own country the larger titmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing branches, almost like a creeper; it often, like a shrike, kills small birds by blows on the head; and I have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. In North America the black bear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus catching, like a whale, insects in the water. Even in so extreme a case as this, if the supply of insects were constant, and if better adapted competitors did not already exist in the country, I can see no difficulty in a race of bears being rendered, by natural selection, more and more aquatic in their structure and habits, with larger and larger mouths, till a creature was produced as monstrous as a whale.

As we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely different from those both of their own species and of the other species of the same genus, we might expect, on my theory, that such individuals would occasionally have given rise to new species, having anomalous habits, and with their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of their proper type. And such instances do occur in nature. Can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? Yet in North America there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing; and on the plains of La Plata, where not a tree grows, there is a woodpecker, which in every essential part of its organisation, even in its colouring, in the harsh tone of its voice, and undulatory flight, told me plainly of its close blood-relationship to our common species; yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree!

Petrels are the most aërial and oceanic of birds, yet in the quiet Sounds of Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general habits, in its astonishing power of diving, its manner of swimming, and of flying when unwillingly it takes flight, would be mistaken by any one for an auk or grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with many parts of its organisation profoundly modified. On the other hand, the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the water-ouzel would never have suspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this anomalous member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by diving,—grasping the stones with its feet and using its wings under water.

He who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having habits and structure not at all in agreement. What can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water; and no one except Audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four toes webbed, alight on the surface of the sea. On the other hand, grebes and coots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by membrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants, yet the water-hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot; and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge. In such cases, and many others could be given, habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. The webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in function, though not in structure. In the frigate-bird, the deeply-scooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change.

He who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say, that in these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one type to take the place of one of another type; but this seems to me only restating the fact in dignified language. He who believes in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection, will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers; and that if any one being vary ever so little, either in habits or structure, and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the country, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different it may be from its own place. Hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate-birds with webbed feet, either living on the dry land or most rarely alighting on the water; that there should be long-toed corncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be woodpeckers where not a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.




Organs of extreme perfection and complication.—To suppose that the eye, with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree. Yet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its possessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so slightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.

In looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been perfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors; but this is scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to look to species of the same group, that is to the collateral descendants from the same original parent-form, in order to see what gradations are possible, and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the earlier stages of descent, in an unaltered or little altered condition. Amongst existing Vertebrata, we find but a small amount of gradation in the structure of the eye, and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this head. In this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages, by which the eye has been perfected.

In the Articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely coated with pigment, and without any other mechanism; and from this low stage, numerous gradations of structure, branching off in two fundamentally different lines, can be shown to exist, until we reach a moderately high stage of perfection. In certain crustaceans, for instance, there is a double cornea, the inner one divided into facets, within each of which there is a lens shaped swelling. In other crustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment, and which properly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light, are convex at their upper ends and must act by convergence; and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance. With these facts, here far too briefly and imperfectly given, which show that there is much graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans, and bearing in mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct, I can see no very great difficulty (not more than in the case of many other structures) in believing that natural selection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane, into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great Articulate class.

He who will go thus far, if he find on finishing this treatise that large bodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of descent, ought not to hesitate to go further, and to admit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural selection, although in this case he does not know any of the transitional grades. His reason ought to conquer his imagination; though I have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths.

It is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know that this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of the highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be presumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by intellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an optical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing slowly in density, so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. Further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers; and carefully selecting each alteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in any degree, tend to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million; and each to be preserved till a better be produced, and then the old ones to be destroyed. In living bodies, variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will multiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions on millions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to those of man?

If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case. No doubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades, more especially if we look to much-isolated species, round which, according to my theory, there has been much extinction. Or again, if we look to an organ common to all the members of a large class, for in this latter case the organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period, since which all the many members of the class have been developed; and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has passed, we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since become extinct.

We should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions; thus the alimentary canal respires, digests, and excretes in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish Cobites. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. In such cases natural selection might easily specialise, if any advantage were thus gained, a part or organ, which had performed two functions, for one function alone, and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps. Two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the same individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills or branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that they breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by highly vascular partitions. In these cases, one of the two organs might with ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself, being aided during the process of modification by the other organ; and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be quite obliterated.

The illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one for a wholly different purpose, namely respiration. The swimbladder has, also, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fish, or, for I do not know which view is now generally held, a part of the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the swimbladder. All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or “ideally similar,” in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into a lung, or organ used exclusively for respiration.

I can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype, of which we know nothing, furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder. We can thus, as I infer from Professor Owen's interesting description of these parts, understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea, with some risk of falling into the lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is closed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiae have wholly disappeared— the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like course of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position. But it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose: in the same manner as, on the view entertained by some naturalists that the branchiae and dorsal scales of Annelids are homologous with the wings and wing-covers of insects, it is probable that organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of flight.

In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will give one more instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched within the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiae, the whole surface of the body and sack, including the small frena, serving for respiration. The Balanidae or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, in the well-enclosed shell; but they have large folded branchiae. Now I think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each other. Therefore I do not doubt that little folds of skin, which originally served as ovigerous frena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided the act of respiration, have been gradually converted by natural selection into branchiae, simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands. If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct, and they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes, who would ever have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of the sack?

Although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could not possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations, yet, undoubtedly, grave cases of difficulty occur, some of which will be discussed in my future work.

One of the gravest is that of neuter insects, which are often very differently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but this case will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs of fishes offer another case of special difficulty; it is impossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced; but, as Owen and others have remarked, their intimate structure closely resembles that of common muscle; and as it has lately been shown that Rays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus, and yet do not, as Matteuchi asserts, discharge any electricity, we must own that we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible.

The electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty; for they occur in only about a dozen fishes, of which several are widely remote in their affinities. Generally when the same organ appears in several members of the same class, especially if in members having very different habits of life, we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor; and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse or natural selection. But if the electric organs had been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided, we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to each other. Nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric organs, which most of their modified descendants have lost. The presence of luminous organs in a few insects, belonging to different families and orders, offers a parallel case of difficulty. Other cases could be given; for instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with a sticky gland at the end, is the same in Orchis and Asclepias,—genera almost as remote as possible amongst flowering plants. In all these cases of two very distinct species furnished with apparently the same anomalous organ, it should be observed that, although the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same, yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected. I am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on the very same invention, so natural selection, working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations, has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings, which owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor.

Although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what transitions an organ could have arrived at its present state; yet, considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct and unknown is very small, I have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. The truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in natural history of “Natura non facit saltum.” We meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as Milne Edwards has well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety, but niggard in innovation. Why, on the theory of Creation, should this be so? Why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be so invariably linked together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature have taken a leap from structure to structure? On the theory of natural selection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations; she can never take a leap, but must advance by the shortest and slowest steps.




Organs of little apparent importance.—As natural selection acts by life and death,—by the preservation of individuals with any favourable variation, and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation of structure,—I have sometimes felt much difficulty in understanding the origin of simple parts, of which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals. I have sometimes felt as much difficulty, though of a very different kind, on this head, as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye.

In the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy of any one organic being, to say what slight modifications would be of importance or not. In a former chapter I have given instances of most trifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of the flesh, which, from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated with constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on by natural selection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed fly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications, each better and better, for so trifling an object as driving away flies; yet we should pause before being too positive even in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in South America absolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects: so that individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage. It is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed (except in some rare cases) by the flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey.

Organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high importance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly perfected at a former period, have been transmitted in nearly the same state, although now become of very slight use; and any actually injurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural selection. Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals, its general presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals, which in their lungs or modified swim-bladders betray their aquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted for. A well-developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of prehension, or as an aid in turning, as with the dog, though the aid must be slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double quickly enough.

In the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to characters which are really of very little importance, and which have originated from quite secondary causes, independently of natural selection. We should remember that climate, food, etc., probably have some little direct influence on the organisation; that characters reappear from the law of reversion; that correlation of growth will have had a most important influence in modifying various structures; and finally, that sexual selection will often have largely modified the external characters of animals having a will, to give one male an advantage in fighting with another or in charming the females. Moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes, it may at first have been of no advantage to the species, but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly acquired habits.

To give a few instances to illustrate these latter remarks. If green woodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting bird from its enemies; and consequently that it was a character of importance and might have been acquired through natural selection; as it is, I have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause, probably to sexual selection. A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest service to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers, the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber. The naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the clean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this act; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which have only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals.

We are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations; and we are immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries,—more especially in the less civilized countries where there has been but little artificial selection. Careful observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with the hair the horns are correlated. Mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis; and then by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and even the head would probably be affected. The shape, also, of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb. The laborious breathing necessary in high regions would, we have some reason to believe, increase the size of the chest; and again correlation would come into play. Animals kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence, and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection, and individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed best under different climates; and there is reason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated. A good observer, also, states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants; so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection. But we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known and unknown laws of variation; and I have here alluded to them only to show that, if we are unable to account for the characteristic differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we generally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of the slight analogous differences between species. I might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.

The foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor. They believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man, or for mere variety. This doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to my theory. Yet I fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessors. Physical conditions probably have had some little effect on structure, quite independently of any good thus gained. Correlation of growth has no doubt played a most important part, and a useful modification of one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use. So again characters which formerly were useful, or which formerly had arisen from correlation of growth, or from other unknown cause, may reappear from the law of reversion, though now of no direct use. The effects of sexual selection, when displayed in beauty to charm the females, can be called useful only in rather a forced sense. But by far the most important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species. Thus, we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose or of the frigate-bird are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that the same bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore leg of the horse, in the wing of the bat, and in the flipper of the seal, are of special use to these animals. We may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. But to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds. So we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a flipper, but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey, horse, and bat, which have been inherited from a common progenitor, were formerly of more special use to that progenitor, or its progenitors, than they now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits. Therefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired through natural selection, subjected formerly, as now, to the several laws of inheritance, reversion, correlation of growth, etc. Hence every detail of structure in every living creature (making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been of special use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to the descendants of this form—either directly, or indirectly through the complex laws of growth.

Natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one species exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by, the structure of another. But natural selection can and does often produce structures for the direct injury of other species, as we see in the fang of the adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs are deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through natural selection. Although many statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect, I cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. It is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence and for the destruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at the same time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely, to warn its prey to escape. I would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed mouse. But I have not space here to enter on this and other such cases.

Natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to itself, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each. No organ will be formed, as Paley has remarked, for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor. If a fair balance be struck between the good and evil caused by each part, each will be found on the whole advantageous. After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of life, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be not so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.

Natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as, or slightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same country with which it has to struggle for existence. And we see that this is the degree of perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions of New Zealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants and animals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not produce absolute perfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with this high standard under nature. The correction for the aberration of light is said, on high authority, not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the eye. If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may easily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect. Can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect, which, when used against many attacking animals, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the backward serratures, and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera?

If we look at the sting of the bee, as having originally existed in a remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many members of the same great order, and which has been modified but not perfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally adapted to cause galls subsequently intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the insect's own death: for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community, it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the death of some few members. If we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are utterly useless to the community for any other end, and which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It may be difficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen-bee, which urges her instantly to destroy the young queens her daughters as soon as born, or to perish herself in the combat; for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love or maternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the same to the inexorable principle of natural selection. If we admire the several ingenious contrivances, by which the flowers of the orchis and of many other plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as equally perfect the elaboration by our fir-trees of dense clouds of pollen, in order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the ovules?




Summary of Chapter.—We have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory. Many of them are very grave; but I think that in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts, which on the theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few forms; and partly because the very process of natural selection almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations. Closely allied species, now living on a continuous area, must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another. When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an intermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the two forms which it connects; consequently the two latter, during the course of further modification, from existing in greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it.

We have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each other; that a bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural selection from an animal which at first could only glide through the air.

We have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its habits, or have diversified habits, with some habits very unlike those of its nearest congeners. Hence we can understand, bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers, diving thrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.

Although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been formed by natural selection, is more than enough to stagger any one; yet in the case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in complexity, each good for its possessor, then, under changing conditions of life, there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. In the cases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should be very cautious in concluding that none could have existed, for the homologies of many organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses in function are at least possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has apparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions, and then having been specialised for one function; and two very distinct organs having performed at the same time the same function, the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated transitions.

We are far too ignorant, in almost every case, to be enabled to assert that any part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection. But we may confidently believe that many modifications, wholly due to the laws of growth, and at first in no way advantageous to a species, have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this species. We may, also, believe that a part formerly of high importance has often been retained (as the tail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has become of such small importance that it could not, in its present state, have been acquired by natural selection,—a power which acts solely by the preservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life.

Natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive good or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and excretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious to another species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner. Natural selection in each well-stocked country, must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will produce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to the standard of that country. Hence the inhabitants of one country, generally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country. For in the larger country there will have existed more individuals, and more diversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher. Natural selection will not necessarily produce absolute perfection; nor, as far as we can judge by our limited faculties, can absolute perfection be everywhere found.

On the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history, “Natura non facit saltum.” This canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is not strictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must by my theory be strictly true.

It is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great laws—Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure, which we see in organic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their habits of life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of descent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by the illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by having adapted them during long-past periods of time: the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse, being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life, and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth. Hence, in fact, the law of the Conditions of Existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the inheritance of former adaptations, that of Unity of Type.





CHAPTER VII　INSTINCT


Instincts comparable with habits, but different in their origin— Instincts graduated—Aphides and ants—Instincts variable— Domestic instincts, their origin—Natural instincts of the cuckoo, ostrich, and parasitic bees—Slave-making ants—Hive-bee, its cell- making instinct—Difficulties on the theory of the Natural Selection of instincts—Neuter or sterile insects—Summary

The subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous chapters; but I have thought that it would be more convenient to treat the subject separately, especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hive-bee making its cells will probably have occurred to many readers, as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory. I must premise, that I have nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers, any more than I have with that of life itself. We are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within the same class.

I will not attempt any definition of instinct. It would be easy to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term; but every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds' nests. An action, which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to perform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young one, without any experience, and when performed by many individuals in the same way, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is usually said to be instinctive. But I could show that none of these characters of instinct are universal. A little dose, as Pierre Huber expresses it, of judgment or reason, often comes into play, even in animals very low in the scale of nature.

Frederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, a remarkably accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed, but not of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual actions are performed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will! yet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits easily become associated with other habits, and with certain periods of time and states of the body. When once acquired, they often remain constant throughout life. Several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits could be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts, one action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a person be interrupted in a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought: so P. Huber found it was with a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated hammock; for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage of construction, and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth stages of construction. If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work was already done for it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and, in order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third stage, where it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already finished work.

If we suppose any habitual action to become inherited—and I think it can be shown that this does sometimes happen—then the resemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be distinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three years old with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no practice at all, he might truly be said to have done so instinctively. But it would be the most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations. It can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the hive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been thus acquired.

It will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as corporeal structure for the welfare of each species, under its present conditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a species; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then I can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable. It is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated. As modifications of corporeal structure arise from, and are increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by disuse, so I do not doubt it has been with instincts. But I believe that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of instincts;—that is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure.

No complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection, except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight, yet profitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures, we ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been acquired—for these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of each species—but we ought to find in the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and this we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find, making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in Europe and North America, and for no instinct being known amongst extinct species, how very generally gradations, leading to the most complex instincts, can be discovered. The canon of “Natura non facit saltum” applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodily organs. Changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts at different periods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or when placed under different circumstances, etc.; in which case either one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection. And such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.

Again as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably with my theory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never, as far as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others. One of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is that of aphides voluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants: that they do so voluntarily, the following facts show. I removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance during several hours. After this interval, I felt sure that the aphides would want to excrete. I watched them for some time through a lens, but not one excreted; I then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner, as well as I could, as the ants do with their antennae; but not one excreted. Afterwards I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately seemed, by its eager way of running about, to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered; it then began to play with its antennae on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another; and each aphis, as soon as it felt the antennae, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant. Even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was instinctive, and not the result of experience. But as the excretion is extremely viscid, it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it removed; and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete for the sole good of the ants. Although I do not believe that any animal in the world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a distinct species, yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts of others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of others. So again, in some few cases, certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not indispensable, they may be here passed over.

As some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and the inheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of natural selection, as many instances as possible ought to have been here given; but want of space prevents me. I can only assert, that instincts certainly do vary—for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and direction, and in its total loss. So it is with the nests of birds, which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the nature and temperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes wholly unknown to us: Audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in nests of the same species in the northern and southern United States. Fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen in nestling birds, though it is strengthened by experience, and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals. But fear of man is slowly acquired, as I have elsewhere shown, by various animals inhabiting desert islands; and we may see an instance of this, even in England, in the greater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds; for the large birds have been most persecuted by man. We may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the magpie, so wary in England, is tame in Norway, as is the hooded crow in Egypt.

That the general disposition of individuals of the same species, born in a state of nature, is extremely diversified, can be shown by a multitude of facts. Several cases also, could be given, of occasional and strange habits in certain species, which might, if advantageous to the species, give rise, through natural selection, to quite new instincts. But I am well aware that these general statements, without facts given in detail, can produce but a feeble effect on the reader's mind. I can only repeat my assurance, that I do not speak without good evidence.

The possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few cases under domestication. We shall thus also be enabled to see the respective parts which habit and the selection of so-called accidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic animals. A number of curious and authentic instances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes, and likewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or periods of time. But let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds of dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (I have myself seen a striking instance) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of at, a flock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot see that these actions, performed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner by each individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and without the end being known,—for the young pointer can no more know that he points to aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage,—I cannot see that these actions differ essentially from true instincts. If we were to see one kind of wolf, when young and without any training, as soon as it scented its prey, stand motionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of deer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly call these actions instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are certainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts; but they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions of life.

How strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are inherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when different breeds of dogs are crossed. Thus it is known that a cross with a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of shepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic instincts, when thus tested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a like manner become curiously blended together, and for a long period exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy describes a dog, whose great-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way, by not coming in a straight line to his master when called.

Domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become inherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this, I think, is not true. No one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably could have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble,—an action which, as I have witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon tumble. We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to this strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are; and near Glasgow there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent, which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. It may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point, had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and this is known occasionally to happen, as I once saw in a pure terrier. When the first tendency was once displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the work; and unconscious selection is still at work, as each man tries to procure, without intending to improve the breed, dogs which will stand and hunt best. On the other hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed; no animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit; scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but I do not suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness; and I presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness, simply to habit and long-continued close confinement.

Natural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become “broody,” that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. Familiarity alone prevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic animals have been modified by domestication. It is scarcely possible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. All wolves, foxes, jackals, and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most eager to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs; and this tendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries, such as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do not keep these domestic animals. How rarely, on the other hand, do our civilised dogs, even when quite young, require to be taught not to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs! No doubt they occasionally do make an attack, and are then beaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed; so that habit, with some degree of selection, has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs. On the other hand, young chickens have lost, wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them, in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in young pheasants, though reared under a hen. It is not that chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if the hen gives the danger-chuckle, they will run (more especially young turkeys) from under her, and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets; and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away. But this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has almost lost by disuse the power of flight.

Hence, we may conclude, that domestic instincts have been acquired and natural instincts have been lost partly by habit, and partly by man selecting and accumulating during successive generations, peculiar mental habits and actions, which at first appeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident. In some cases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes; in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of selection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most cases, probably, habit and selection have acted together.

We shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature have become modified by selection, by considering a few cases. I will select only three, out of the several which I shall have to discuss in my future work,— namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants; and the comb-making power of the hive-bee: these two latter instincts have generally, and most justly, been ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known instincts.

It is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the cuckoo's instinct is, that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at intervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest. If this were the case, the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as she has to migrate at a very early period; and the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone. But the American cuckoo is in this predicament; for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched, all at the same time. It has been asserted that the American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds' nests; but I hear on the high authority of Dr. Brewer, that this is a mistake. Nevertheless, I could give several instances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests. Now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our European cuckoo had the habits of the American cuckoo; but that occasionally she laid an egg in another bird's nest. If the old bird profited by this occasional habit, or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird, than by their own mother's care, encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time; then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage. And analogy would lead me to believe, that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be successful in rearing their young. By a continued process of this nature, I believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be, and has been, generated. I may add that, according to Dr. Gray and to some other observers, the European cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and care for her own offspring.

The occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds' nests, either of the same or of a distinct species, is not very uncommon with the Gallinaceae; and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in the allied group of ostriches. For several hen ostriches, at least in the case of the American species, unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest and then in another; and these are hatched by the males. This instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of eggs; but, as in the case of the cuckoo, at intervals of two or three days. This instinct, however, of the American ostrich has not as yet been perfected; for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so that in one day's hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs.

Many bees are parasitic, and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of other kinds. This case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo; for these bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits; for they do not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store food for their own young. Some species, likewise, of Sphegidae (wasp-like insects) are parasitic on other species; and M. Fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although the Tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larvae to feed on, yet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex, it takes advantage of the prize, and becomes for the occasion parasitic. In this case, as with the supposed case of the cuckoo, I can see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit permanent, if of advantage to the species, and if the insect whose nest and stored food are thus feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated.




Slave-making instinct.—This remarkable instinct was first discovered in the Formica (Polyerges) rufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even than his celebrated father. This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves; without their aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single year. The males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile females, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no other work. They are incapable of making their own nests, or of feeding their own larvae. When the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have to migrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration, and actually carry their masters in their jaws. So utterly helpless are the masters, that when Huber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty of the food which they like best, and with their larvae and pupae to stimulate them to work, they did nothing; they could not even feed themselves, and many perished of hunger. Huber then introduced a single slave (F. fusca), and she instantly set to work, fed and saved the survivors; made some cells and tended the larvae, and put all to rights. What can be more extraordinary than these well-ascertained facts? If we had not known of any other slave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected.

Formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by P. Huber to be a slave-making ant. This species is found in the southern parts of England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith, of the British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on this and other subjects. Although fully trusting to the statements of Huber and Mr. Smith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind, as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves. Hence I will give the observations which I have myself made, in some little detail. I opened fourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all. Males and fertile females of the slave-species are found only in their own proper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of F. sanguinea. The slaves are black and not above half the size of their red masters, so that the contrast in their appearance is very great. When the nest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is much disturbed and the larvae and pupae are exposed, the slaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety. Hence, it is clear, that the slaves feel quite at home. During the months of June and July, on three successive years, I have watched for many hours several nests in Surrey and Sussex, and never saw a slave either leave or enter a nest. As, during these months, the slaves are very few in number, I thought that they might behave differently when more numerous; but Mr. Smith informs me that he has watched the nests at various hours during May, June and August, both in Surrey and Hampshire, and has never seen the slaves, though present in large numbers in August, either leave or enter the nest. Hence he considers them as strictly household slaves. The masters, on the other hand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and food of all kinds. During the present year, however, in the month of July, I came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves, and I observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest, and marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir-tree, twenty-five yards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of aphides or cocci. According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation, in Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening; and, as Huber expressly states, their principal office is to search for aphides. This difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two countries, probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in Switzerland than in England.

One day I fortunately chanced to witness a migration from one nest to another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters carefully carrying, as Huber has described, their slaves in their jaws. Another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidently not in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species (F. fusca); sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea. The latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were prevented from getting any pupae to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small parcel of the pupae of F. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a bare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized, and carried off by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been victorious in their late combat.

At the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae of another species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still clinging to the fragments of the nest. This species is sometimes, though rarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith. Although so small a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it ferociously attack other ants. In one instance I found to my surprise an independent community of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slave-making F. sanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both nests, the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage. Now I was curious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea could distinguish the pupae of F. fusca, which they habitually make into slaves, from those of the little and furious F. flava, which they rarely capture, and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them: for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of F. fusca, whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae, or even the earth from the nest of F. flava, and quickly ran away; but in about a quarter of an hour, shortly after all the little yellow ants had crawled away, they took heart and carried off the pupae.

One evening I visited another community of F. sanguinea, and found a number of these ants entering their nest, carrying the dead bodies of F. fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and numerous pupae. I traced the returning file burthened with booty, for about forty yards, to a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the last individual of F. sanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath. The nest, however, must have been close at hand, for two or three individuals of F. fusca were rushing about in the greatest agitation, and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath over its ravaged home.

Such are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves. Let it be observed what a contrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with those of the F. rufescens. The latter does not build its own nest, does not determine its own migrations, does not collect food for itself or its young, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on its numerous slaves. Formica sanguinea, on the other hand, possesses much fewer slaves, and in the early part of the summer extremely few. The masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed, and when they migrate, the masters carry the slaves. Both in Switzerland and England the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvae, and the masters alone go on slave-making expeditions. In Switzerland the slaves and masters work together, making and bringing materials for the nest: both, but chiefly the slaves, tend, and milk as it may be called, their aphides; and thus both collect food for the community. In England the masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials and food for themselves, their slaves and larvae. So that the masters in this country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in Switzerland.

By what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend to conjecture. But as ants, which are not slave-makers, will, as I have seen, carry off pupae of other species, if scattered near their nests, it is possible that pupae originally stored as food might become developed; and the ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their proper instincts, and do what work they could. If their presence proved useful to the species which had seized them—if it were more advantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate them—the habit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of raising slaves. When the instinct was once acquired, if carried out to a much less extent even than in our British F. sanguinea, which, as we have seen, is less aided by its slaves than the same species in Switzerland, I can see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the instinct—always supposing each modification to be of use to the species—until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is the Formica rufescens.




Cell-making instinct of the Hive-Bee.—I will not here enter on minute details on this subject, but will merely give an outline of the conclusions at which I have arrived. He must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without enthusiastic admiration. We hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction. It has been remarked that a skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. Grant whatever instincts you please, and it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are correctly made. But the difficulty is not nearly so great as it at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I think, to follow from a few very simple instincts.

I was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only as a modification of his theory. Let us look to the great principle of gradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of work. At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a double layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join on to a pyramid, formed of three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb, enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. In the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and the simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the Mexican Melipona domestica, carefully described and figured by Pierre Huber. The Melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey. These latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an irregular mass. But the important point to notice, is that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other, that they would have intersected or broken into each other, if the spheres had been completed; but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect. Hence each cell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two, three, or more perfectly flat surfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells. When one cell comes into contact with three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal basis of the cell of the hive-bee. As in the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells. It is obvious that the Melipona saves wax by this manner of building; for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.

Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the resulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the hive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:—

If a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two parallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius , or radius×1.41421 (or at some lesser distance), from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer; and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the several spheres in both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs; and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the cells of the hive-bee.

Hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the hive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to make her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes; and this would not be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects can make, apparently by turning round on a fixed point. We must suppose the Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does her cylindrical cells; and we must further suppose, and this is the greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance, that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely; and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces. We have further to suppose, but this is no difficulty, that after hexagonal prisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer, she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of honey; in the same way as the rude humble-bee adds cylinders of wax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons. By such modifications of instincts in themselves not very wonderful,—hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to make its nest,—I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural powers.

But this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the example of Mr. Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long, thick, square strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins, appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a cell. It was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together, they had begun their work at such a distance from each other, that by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width (i.e. about the width of an ordinary cell), and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part, the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other. As soon as this occurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and began to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins, so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin, instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary cells.

I then put into the hive, instead of a thick, square piece of wax, a thin and narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. The bees instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other, in the same way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that the bottoms of the basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former experiment, would have broken into each other from the opposite sides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they stopped their excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon as they had been a little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these flat bottoms, formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left ungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides of the ridge of wax. In parts, only little bits, in other parts, large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins, but the work, from the unnatural state of things, had not been neatly performed. The bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they circularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides, in order to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection.

Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness, and then stopping their work. In ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave on one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed side, where the bees had worked less quickly. In one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and allowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined the cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had become perfectly flat: it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic plate, that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax (which as I have tried is easily done) into its proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.

From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax, we can clearly see that if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break into each other. Now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all round the comb; and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides, always working circularly as they deepen each cell. They do not make the whole three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or the two plates, as the case may be; and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are commenced. Some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated elder Huber, but I am convinced of their accuracy; and if I had space, I could show that they are conformable with my theory.

Huber's statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly correct; the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax; but I will not here enter on these details. We see how important a part excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper position—that is, along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres. I have several specimens showing clearly that they can do this. Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a growing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. But the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being largely gnawed away on both sides. The manner in which the bees build is curious; they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will ultimately be left. We shall understand how they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle; the masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement, on the summit of the ridge. We shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward; but always crowned by a gigantic coping. From all the cells, both those just commenced and those completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls, which are only about one four-hundredth of an inch in thickness; the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick. By this singular manner of building, strength is continually given to the comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax.

It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as Huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell. I was able practically to show this fact, by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by the bees—as delicately as a painter could have done with his brush—by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into the growing edges of the cells all round. The work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the planes of intersection between these spheres. It was really curious to note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle, how often the bees would entirely pull down and rebuild in different ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected.

When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions for working,—for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over one face of the slip—in this case the bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting beyond the other completed cells. It suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres; but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of the adjoining cells has been built. This capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact, which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory; namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes strictly hexagonal; but I have not space here to enter on this subject. Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect (as in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if she work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up intermediate planes. It is even conceivable that an insect might, by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell, and then moving outside, first to one point, and then to five other points, at the proper relative distances from the central point and from each other, strike the planes of intersection, and so make an isolated hexagon: but I am not aware that any such case has been observed; nor would any good be derived from a single hexagon being built, as in its construction more materials would be required than for a cylinder.

As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee? I think the answer is not difficult: it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr. Tegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound of wax; so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs. Moreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion. A large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family of bees. Of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees could collect. But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers of a humble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently required a store of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells, would save some little wax. Hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bee, if she were to make her cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells, and much wax would be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in every way than at present; for then, as we have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all be replaced by plane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural selection could not lead; for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising wax.

Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler instincts; natural selection having by slow degrees, more and more perfectly, led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection. The bees, of course, no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other, than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates. The motive power of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax; that individual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to new swarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence.




No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selection,—cases, in which we cannot see how an instinct could possibly have originated; cases, in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist; cases of instinct of apparently such trifling importance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature, that we cannot account for their similarity by inheritance from a common parent, and must therefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. I will not here enter on these several cases, but will confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory. I allude to the neuters or sterile females in insect-communities: for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate their kind.

The subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will here take only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. How the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure; for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile; and if such insects had been social, and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural selection. But I must pass over this preliminary difficulty. The great difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in structure, as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. As far as instinct alone is concerned, the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers and the perfect females, would have been far better exemplified by the hive-bee. If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal in the ordinary state, I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection; namely, by an individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of structure, this being inherited by its offspring, which again varied and were again selected, and so onwards. But with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that it could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its progeny. It may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?

First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts of differences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages, and to either sex. We have differences correlated not only to one sex, but to that short period alone when the reproductive system is active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon. We have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex; for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds, in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds. Hence I can see no real difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insect-communities: the difficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection.

This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the desired end. Thus, a well-flavoured vegetable is cooked, and the individual is destroyed; but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock, and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety; breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together; the animal has been slaughtered, but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family. I have such faith in the powers of selection, that I do not doubt that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns, could be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind. Thus I believe it has been with social insects: a slight modification of structure, or instinct, correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community, has been advantageous to the community: consequently the fertile males and females of the same community flourished, and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same modification. And I believe that this process has been repeated, until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced, which we see in many social insects.

But we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty; namely, the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes. The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are perfectly well defined; being as distinct from each other, as are any two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same family. Thus in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts extraordinarily different: in Cryptocerus, the workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use of which is quite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never leave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our European ants guard or imprison.

It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful and well-established facts at once annihilate my theory. In the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind, which have been rendered by natural selection, as I believe to be quite possible, different from the fertile males and females,—in this case, we may safely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that each successive, slight, profitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the individual neuters in the same nest, but in a few alone; and that by the long-continued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters with the profitable modification, all the neuters ultimately came to have the desired character. On this view we ought occasionally to find neuter-insects of the same species, in the same nest, presenting gradations of structure; and this we do find, even often, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined. Mr. F. Smith has shown how surprisingly the neuters of several British ants differ from each other in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest: I have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. It often happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous; or that both large and small are numerous, with those of an intermediate size scanty in numbers. Formica flava has larger and smaller workers, with some of intermediate size; and, in this species, as Mr. F. Smith has observed, the larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which though small can be plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary. Having carefully dissected several specimens of these workers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally lesser size; and I fully believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition. So that we here have two bodies of sterile workers in the same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of vision, yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. I may digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful to the community, and those males and females had been continually selected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all the workers had come to be in this condition; we should then have had a species of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of Myrmica. For the workers of Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli, though the male and female ants of this genus have well- developed ocelli.

I may give one other case: so confidently did I expect to find gradations in important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F. Smith's offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant (Anomma) of West Africa. The reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these workers, by my giving not the actual measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration: the difference was the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five times as big. The jaws, moreover, of the working ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the form and number of the teeth. But the important fact for us is, that though the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they graduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different structure of their jaws. I speak confidently on this latter point, as Mr. Lubbock made drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which I had dissected from the workers of the several sizes.

With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting on the fertile parents, could form a species which should regularly produce neuters, either all of large size with one form of jaw, or all of small size with jaws having a widely different structure; or lastly, and this is our climax of difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure;—a graduated series having been first formed, as in the case of the driver ant, and then the extreme forms, from being the most useful to the community, having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the natural selection of the parents which generated them; until none with an intermediate structure were produced.

Thus, as I believe, the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from each other and from their parents, has originated. We can see how useful their production may have been to a social community of insects, on the same principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man. As ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited tools or weapons, and not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments, a perfect division of labour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile; for had they been fertile, they would have intercrossed, and their instincts and structure would have become blended. And nature has, as I believe, effected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants, by the means of natural selection. But I am bound to confess, that, with all my faith in this principle, I should never have anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not the case of these neuter insects convinced me of the fact. I have, therefore, discussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient length, in order to show the power of natural selection, and likewise because this is by far the most serious special difficulty, which my theory has encountered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it proves that with animals, as with plants, any amount of modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, and as we must call them accidental, variations, which are in any manner profitable, without exercise or habit having come into play. For no amount of exercise, or habit, or volition, in the utterly sterile members of a community could possibly have affected the structure or instincts of the fertile members, which alone leave descendants. I am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of Lamarck.




Summary.—I have endeavoured briefly in this chapter to show that the mental qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations are inherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each animal. Therefore I can see no difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection accumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent, in any useful direction. In some cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into play. I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in any great degree my theory; but none of the cases of difficulty, to the best of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other hand, the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to mistakes;—that no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of other animals, but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of others;—that the canon in natural history, of “natura non facit saltum” is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise inexplicable,—all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection.

This theory is, also, strengthened by some few other facts in regard to instincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but certainly distinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly the same instincts. For instance, we can understand on the principle of inheritance, how it is that the thrush of South America lines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British thrush: how it is that the male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build “cock-nests,” to roost in, like the males of our distinct Kitty-wrens,—a habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird. Finally, it may not be a logical deduction, but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers,—ants making slaves,—the larvae of ichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,—not as specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one general law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely, multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.





CHAPTER VIII　HYBRIDISM


Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids— Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close interbreeding, removed by domestication—Laws governing the sterility of hybrids—Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on other differences—Causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids—Parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and crossing—Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring not universal—Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility—Summary

The view generally entertained by naturalists is that species, when intercrossed, have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility, in order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms. This view certainly seems at first probable, for species within the same country could hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely. The importance of the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile, has, I think, been much underrated by some late writers. On the theory of natural selection the case is especially important, inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage to them, and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility. I hope, however, to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired or endowed quality, but is incidental on other acquired differences.

In treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent fundamentally different, have generally been confounded together; namely, the sterility of two species when first crossed, and the sterility of the hybrids produced from them.

Pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect condition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring. Hybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs functionally impotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both plants and animals; though the organs themselves are perfect in structure, as far as the microscope reveals. In the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are either not at all developed, or are imperfectly developed. This distinction is important, when the cause of the sterility, which is common to the two cases, has to be considered. The distinction has probably been slurred over, owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment, beyond the province of our reasoning powers.

The fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to have descended from common parents, when intercrossed, and likewise the fertility of their mongrel offspring, is, on my theory, of equal importance with the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad and clear distinction between varieties and species.

First, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid offspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable observers, Kölreuter and Gärtner, who almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility. Kölreuter makes the rule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties. Gärtner, also, makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the entire fertility of Kölreuter's ten cases. But in these and in many other cases, Gärtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to show that there is any degree of sterility. He always compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring, with the average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature. But a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced: a plant to be hybridised must be castrated, and, what is often more important, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants. Nearly all the plants experimentised on by Gärtner were potted, and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house. That these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted; for Gärtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated, and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and (excluding all cases such as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired. Moreover, as Gärtner during several years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip, which we have such good reason to believe to be varieties, and only once or twice succeeded in getting fertile seed; as he found the common red and blue pimpernels (Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank as varieties, absolutely sterile together; and as he came to the same conclusion in several other analogous cases; it seems to me that we may well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as Gärtner believes.

It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins. I think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived, namely, Kölreuter and Gärtner, should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same species. It is also most instructive to compare—but I have not space here to enter on details—the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same author, from experiments made during different years. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between species and varieties; but that the evidence from this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences.

In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though Gärtner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increased, but generally greatly decreased. I do not doubt that this is usually the case, and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the first few generations. Nevertheless I believe that in all these experiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause, namely, from close interbreeding. I have collected so large a body of facts, showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on the other hand, that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal belief amongst breeders. Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen; and I am convinced that this would be injurious to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gärtner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. Now, in artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance (as I know from my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross between two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be thus effected. Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer as Gärtner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature. And thus, the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids may, I believe, be accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided.

Now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced hybridiser, namely, the Honourable and Reverend W. Herbert. He is as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile—as fertile as the pure parent-species—as are Kölreuter and Gärtner that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. He experimentised on some of the very same species as did Gärtner. The difference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for by Herbert's great horticultural skill, and by his having hothouses at his command. Of his many important statements I will here give only a single one as an example, namely, that “every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense fertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which (he says) I never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation.” So that we here have perfect, or even more than commonly perfect, fertility in a first cross between two distinct species.

This case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact, namely, that there are individual plants, as with certain species of Lobelia, and with all the species of the genus Hippeastrum, which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct species, than by their own pollen. For these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen of a distinct species, though quite sterile with their own pollen, notwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good, for it fertilised distinct species. So that certain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be self-fertilised! For instance, a bulb of Hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised by Herbert with their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct species: the result was that “the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely.” In a letter to me, in 1839, Mr. Herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment during five years, and he continued to try it during several subsequent years, and always with the same result. This result has, also, been confirmed by other observers in the case of Hippeastrum with its sub-genera, and in the case of some other genera, as Lobelia, Passiflora and Verbascum. Although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly healthy, and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were perfectly good with respect to other species, yet as they were functionally imperfect in their mutual self-action, we must infer that the plants were in an unnatural state. Nevertheless these facts show on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed, in comparison with the same species when self-fertilised, sometimes depends.

The practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with scientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how complicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria, Petunia, Rhododendron, etc., have been crossed, yet many of these hybrids seed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from Calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar in general habit, “reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species from the mountains of Chile.” I have taken some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of Rhododendrons, and I am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile. Mr. C. Noble, for instance, informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between Rhod. Ponticum and Catawbiense, and that this hybrid “seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine.” Had hybrids, when fairly treated, gone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation, as Gärtner believes to be the case, the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen. Horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids, and such alone are fairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other, and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented. Any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of insect-agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons, which produce no pollen, for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers.

In regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than with plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that is if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other, as are the genera of plants, then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants; but the hybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile. I doubt whether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well authenticated. It should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried: for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine other finches, but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile. Again, with respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the contrary, brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation, in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. And in this case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing. If we were to act thus, and pair brothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal, which from any cause had the least tendency to sterility, the breed would assuredly be lost in a very few generations.

Although I do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of perfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have some reason to believe that the hybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus colchicus with P. torquatus and with P. versicolor are perfectly fertile. The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese (A. cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure parent, and in one single instance they have bred inter se. This was effected by Mr. Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents but from different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India, however, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured by two eminently capable judges, namely Mr. Blyth and Capt. Hutton, that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure parent-species exists, they must certainly be highly fertile.

A doctrine which originated with Pallas, has been largely accepted by modern naturalists; namely, that most of our domestic animals have descended from two or more aboriginal species, since commingled by intercrossing. On this view, the aboriginal species must either at first have produced quite fertile hybrids, or the hybrids must have become in subsequent generations quite fertile under domestication. This latter alternative seems to me the most probable, and I am inclined to believe in its truth, although it rests on no direct evidence. I believe, for instance, that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks; yet, with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of South America, all are quite fertile together; and analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids. So again there is reason to believe that our European and the humped Indian cattle are quite fertile together; but from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, I think they must be considered as distinct species. On this view of the origin of many of our domestic animals, we must either give up the belief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of animals when crossed; or we must look at sterility, not as an indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being removed by domestication.

Finally, looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result; but that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered as absolutely universal.




Laws governing the sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids.—We will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been endowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and blending together in utter confusion. The following rules and conclusions are chiefly drawn up from Gärtner's admirable work on the hybridisation of plants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to animals, and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms.

It has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility. It is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist; but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. When pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct family, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust. From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different species of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species, yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility; and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant's own pollen will produce. So in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have produced, and probably never would produce, even with the pollen of either pure parent, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done; and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation. From this extreme degree of sterility we have self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility.

Hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the sterility of the hybrids thus produced—two classes of facts which are generally confounded together—is by no means strict. There are many cases, in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility, and produce numerous hybrid-offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. On the other hand, there are species which can be crossed very rarely, or with extreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last produced, are very fertile. Even within the limits of the same genus, for instance in Dianthus, these two opposite cases occur.

The fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily affected by unfavourable conditions, than is the fertility of pure species. But the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable; for it is not always the same when the same two species are crossed under the same circumstances, but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment. So it is with hybrids, for their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions.

By the term systematic affinity is meant, the resemblance between species in structure and in constitution, more especially in the structure of parts which are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the allied species. Now the fertility of first crosses between species, and of the hybrids produced from them, is largely governed by their systematic affinity. This is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand, by very closely allied species generally uniting with facility. But the correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict. A multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility. In the same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which very many species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as Silene, in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between extremely close species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of the same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many species of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus; but Gärtner found that N. acuminata, which is not a particularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or to be fertilised by, no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Very many analogous facts could be given.

No one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of difference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species crossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and general appearance, and having strongly marked differences in every part of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the cotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and evergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for extremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.

By a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for instance, of a stallion-horse being first crossed with a female-ass, and then a male-ass with a mare: these two species may then be said to have been reciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases are highly important, for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic affinity, or of any recognisable difference in their whole organisation. On the other hand, these cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with constitutional differences imperceptible by us, and confined to the reproductive system. This difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two species was long ago observed by Kölreuter. To give an instance: Mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of M. longiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile; but Kölreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following years, to fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M. jalappa, and utterly failed. Several other equally striking cases could be given. Thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds or Fuci. Gärtner, moreover, found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. He has observed it even between forms so closely related (as Matthiola annua and glabra) that many botanists rank them only as varieties. It is also a remarkable fact, that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though of course compounded of the very same two species, the one species having first been used as the father and then as the mother, generally differ in fertility in a small, and occasionally in a high degree.

Several other singular rules could be given from Gärtner: for instance, some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species; other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at all necessarily go together. There are certain hybrids which instead of having, as is usual, an intermediate character between their two parents, always closely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though externally so like one of their pure parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely sterile. So again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between their parents, exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are born, which closely resemble one of their pure parents; and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile, even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of fertility. These facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent.

Considering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility of first crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be considered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under certain conditions in excess. That their fertility, besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is innately variable. That it is by no means always the same in degree in the first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross. That the fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external appearance either parent. And lastly, that the facility of making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other. This latter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for according as the one species or the other is used as the father or the mother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest possible difference, in the facility of effecting an union. The hybrids, moreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.

Now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in nature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together? Why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species? Why should some species cross with facility, and yet produce very sterile hybrids; and other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids? Why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species? Why, it may even be asked, has the production of hybrids been permitted? to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids, and then to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility, not strictly related to the facility of the first union between their parents, seems to be a strange arrangement.

The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences, chiefly in the reproductive systems, of the species which are crossed. The differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction. It will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an example what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences, and not a specially endowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state of nature, I presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a specially endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants. We can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another, from differences in their rate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or nature of their sap, etc.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody and the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and adaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two grafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is limited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other hand, closely allied species, and varieties of the same species, can usually, but not invariably, be grafted with ease. But this capacity, as in hybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity. Although many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take on each other. The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince, which is ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a member of the same genus. Even different varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum.

As Gärtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different individuals of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being grafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting; the common gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas the currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.

We have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive organs in an imperfect condition, is a very different case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive organs perfect; yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent parallel. Something analogous occurs in grafting; for Thouin found that three species of Robinia, which seeded freely on their own roots, and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on another species, when thus grafted were rendered barren. On the other hand, certain species of Sorbus, when grafted on other species, yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own roots. We are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of Hippeastrum, Lobelia, etc., which seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of distinct species, than when self-fertilised with their own pollen.

We thus see, that although there is a clear and fundamental difference between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union of the male and female elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species. And as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses, are incidental on unknown differences, chiefly in their reproductive systems. These differences, in both cases, follow to a certain extent, as might have been expected, systematic affinity, by which every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. The facts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been a special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms, as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.




Causes of the sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids.—We may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. These two cases are fundamentally different, for, as just remarked, in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual elements are perfect, whereas in hybrids they are imperfect. Even in first crosses, the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to reach the ovarium. It has also been observed that when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though the pollen-tubes protrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface. Again, the male element may reach the female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed, as seems to have been the case with some of Thuret's experiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given of these facts, any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others. Lastly, an embryo may be developed, and then perish at an early period. This latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to; but I believe, from observations communicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in hybridising gallinaceous birds, that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. I was at first very unwilling to believe in this view; as hybrids, when once born, are generally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule. Hybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after birth: when born and living in a country where their two parents can live, they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother, and therefore before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it may be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an early period; more especially as all very young beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.

In regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are imperfectly developed, the case is very different. I have more than once alluded to a large body of facts, which I have collected, showing that when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions, they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected. This, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. Between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points of similarity. In both cases the sterility is independent of general health, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. In both cases, the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male element is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female more than the male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids. On the other hand, one species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility; and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. No one can tell, till he tries, whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or any plant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell, till he tries, whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids. Lastly, when organic beings are placed during several generations under conditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable to vary, which is due, as I believe, to their reproductive systems having been specially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues. So it is with hybrids, for hybrids in successive generations are eminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.

Thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural conditions, and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing of two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state of health, is affected by sterility in a very similar manner. In the one case, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of hybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the organisation has been disturbed by two different structures and constitutions having been blended into one. For it is scarcely possible that two organisations should be compounded into one, without some disturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or mutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another, or to the conditions of life. When hybrids are able to breed inter se, they transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same compounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their sterility, though in some degree variable, rarely diminishes.

It must, however, be confessed that we cannot understand, excepting on vague hypotheses, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids; for instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. Nor do I pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation is offered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions, is rendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show, is that in two cases, in some respects allied, sterility is the common result,—in the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been compounded into one.

It may seem fanciful, but I suspect that a similar parallelism extends to an allied yet very different class of facts. It is an old and almost universal belief, founded, I think, on a considerable body of evidence, that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things. We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent exchanges of seed, tubers, etc., from one soil or climate to another, and back again. During the convalescence of animals, we plainly see that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of life. Again, both with plants and animals, there is abundant evidence, that a cross between very distinct individuals of the same species, that is between members of different strains or sub-breeds, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring. I believe, indeed, from the facts alluded to in our fourth chapter, that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even with hermaphrodites; and that close interbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest relations, especially if these be kept under the same conditions of life, always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny.

Hence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of life benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight crosses, that is crosses between the males and females of the same species which have varied and become slightly different, give vigour and fertility to the offspring. But we have seen that greater changes, or changes of a particular nature, often render organic beings in some degree sterile; and that greater crosses, that is crosses between males and females which have become widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are generally sterile in some degree. I cannot persuade myself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion. Both series of facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond, which is essentially related to the principle of life.




Fertility of Varieties when crossed, and of their Mongrel offspring.—It may be urged, as a most forcible argument, that there must be some essential distinction between species and varieties, and that there must be some error in all the foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties, however much they may differ from each other in external appearance, cross with perfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. I fully admit that this is almost invariably the case. But if we look to varieties produced under nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties; for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together, they are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. For instance, the blue and red pimpernel, the primrose and cowslip, which are considered by many of our best botanists as varieties, are said by Gärtner not to be quite fertile when crossed, and he consequently ranks them as undoubted species. If we thus argue in a circle, the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be granted.

If we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced, under domestication, we are still involved in doubt. For when it is stated, for instance, that the German Spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with foxes, or that certain South American indigenous domestic dogs do not readily cross with European dogs, the explanation which will occur to every one, and probably the true one, is that these dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species. Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties, differing widely from each other in appearance, for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there are, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile when intercrossed. Several considerations, however, render the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears. It can, in the first place, be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed; and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties. In the second place, some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids, which were at first only slightly sterile; and if this be so, we surely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing under nearly the same conditions of life. Lastly, and this seems to me by far the most important consideration, new races of animals and plants are produced under domestication by man's methodical and unconscious power of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he neither wishes to select, nor could select, slight differences in the reproductive system, or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive system. He supplies his several varieties with the same food; treats them in nearly the same manner, and does not wish to alter their general habits of life. Nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods of time on the whole organisation, in any way which may be for each creature's own good; and thus she may, either directly, or more probably indirectly, through correlation, modify the reproductive system in the several descendants from any one species. Seeing this difference in the process of selection, as carried on by man and nature, we need not be surprised at some difference in the result.

I have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species were invariably fertile when intercrossed. But it seems to me impossible to resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of species. The evidence is, also, derived from hostile witnesses, who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction. Gärtner kept during several years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds, growing near each other in his garden; and although these plants have separated sexes, they never naturally crossed. He then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed, and this one head produced only five grains. Manipulation in this case could not have been injurious, as the plants have separated sexes. No one, I believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species; and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves perfectly fertile; so that even Gärtner did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct.

Girou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like the maize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are greater. How far these experiments may be trusted, I know not; but the forms experimentised on, are ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his classification by the test of infertility, as varieties.

The following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first quite incredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments made during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so good an observer and so hostile a witness, as Gärtner: namely, that yellow and white varieties of the same species of Verbascum when intercrossed produce less seed, than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from their own coloured flowers. Moreover, he asserts that when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a distinct species, more seed is produced by the crosses between the same coloured flowers, than between those which are differently coloured. Yet these varieties of Verbascum present no other difference besides the mere colour of the flower; and one variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of the other.

From observations which I have made on certain varieties of hollyhock, I am inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts.

Kölreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer, has proved the remarkable fact, that one variety of the common tobacco is more fertile, when crossed with a widely distinct species, than are the other varieties. He experimentised on five forms, which are commonly reputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the severest trial, namely, by reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly fertile. But one of these five varieties, when used either as father or mother, and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties when crossed with N. glutinosa. Hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified.

From these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety if infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species; from man selecting only external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic varieties, and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system; from these several considerations and facts, I do not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence, or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties and species. The general fertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view which I have taken with respect to the very general, but not invariable, sterility of first crosses and of hybrids, namely, that it is not a special endowment, but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more especially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed.




Hybrids and Mongrels compared, independently of their fertility.— Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of species when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects. Gärtner, whose strong wish was to draw a marked line of distinction between species and varieties, could find very few and, as it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties. And, on the other hand, they agree most closely in very many important respects.

I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids; but Gärtner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation; and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact. Gärtner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species; and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away. When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring is notorious; but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given. The variability, however, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater than in hybrids.

This greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at all surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly domestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural varieties), and this implies in most cases that there has been recent variability; and therefore we might expect that such variability would often continue and be super-added to that arising from the mere act of crossing. The slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross or in the first generation, in contrast with their extreme variability in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact and deserves attention. For it bears on and corroborates the view which I have taken on the cause of ordinary variability; namely, that it is due to the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life, being thus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identical with the parent-form. Now hybrids in the first generation are descended from species (excluding those long cultivated) which have not had their reproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not variable; but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected, and their descendants are highly variable.

But to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids: Gärtner states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in degree. Gärtner further insists that when any two species, although most closely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do not differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded on a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by Kölreuter.

These alone are the unimportant differences, which Gärtner is able to point out, between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species, follows according to Gärtner the same laws. When two species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the hybrid; and so I believe it to be with varieties of plants. With animals one variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another variety. Hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross, generally resemble each other closely; and so it is with mongrels from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parent-form, by repeated crosses in successive generations with either parent.

These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the subject is here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another, and when one variety is crossed with another variety. For instance, I think those authors are right, who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse; but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male-ass than in the female, so that the mule, which is the offspring of the male-ass and mare, is more like an ass, than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.

Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that mongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents; but it can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids; yet I grant much less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels. Looking to the cases which I have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appeared—such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection. Consequently, sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced. On the whole I entirely agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals, comes to the conclusion, that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same, whether the two parents differ much or little from each other, namely in the union of individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of distinct species.

Laying aside the question of fertility and sterility, in all other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring of crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look at species as having been specially created, and at varieties as having been produced by secondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing fact. But it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction between species and varieties.




Summary of Chapter.—First crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not universally, sterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived, have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test. The sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions. The degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is governed by several curious and complex laws. It is generally different, and sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross.

In the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity of one species or variety to take on another, is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another, is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems. There is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests.

The sterility of first crosses between pure species, which have their reproductive systems perfect, seems to depend on several circumstances; in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo. The sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive systems imperfect, and which have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species, seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species, when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed. This view is supported by a parallelism of another kind;—namely, that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring; and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings. It is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species, and the degree of sterility of their hybrid-offspring should generally correspond, though due to distinct causes; for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed. Nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, the fertility of the hybrids produced, and the capacity of being grafted together—though this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstances—should all run, to a certain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment; for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species.

First crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very generally, but not quite universally, fertile. Nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising, when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature; and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences, and not of differences in the reproductive system. In all other respects, excluding fertility, there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels. Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties.





CHAPTER IX　ON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD


On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day—On the nature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number—On the vast lapse of time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation—On the poorness of our palaeontological collections—On the intermittence of geological formations—On the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation—On the sudden appearance of groups of species—On their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata

In the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of them have now been discussed. One, namely the distinctness of specific forms, and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the present day, under the circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence, namely on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to show, that the life of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other already defined organic forms, than on climate; and, therefore, that the really governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture. I endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement. The main cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends on the very process of natural selection, through which new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their parent-forms. But just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties, which have formerly existed on the earth, be truly enormous. Why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the extreme imperfection of the geological record.

In the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of intermediate forms must, on my theory, have formerly existed. I have found it difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing to myself, forms directly intermediate between them. But this is a wholly false view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants. To give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons have both descended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely close series between both and the rock-pigeon; but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter; none, for instance, combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged, the characteristic features of these two breeds. These two breeds, moreover, have become so much modified, that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin, it would not have been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species, such as C. oenas.

So with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to the horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them, but between each and an unknown common parent. The common parent will have had in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both, even perhaps more than they differ from each other. Hence in all such cases, we should be unable to recognise the parent-form of any two or more species, even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants, unless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links.

It is just possible by my theory, that one of two living forms might have descended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and in this case direct intermediate links will have existed between them. But such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change; and the principle of competition between organism and organism, between child and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms.

By the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected with the parent-species of each genus, by differences not greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the present day; and these parent-species, now generally extinct, have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient species; and so on backwards, always converging to the common ancestor of each great class. So that the number of intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct species, must have been inconceivably great. But assuredly, if this theory be true, such have lived upon this earth.




On the lapse of Time.—Independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely numerous connecting links, it may be objected, that time will not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all changes having been effected very slowly through natural selection. It is hardly possible for me even to recall to the reader, who may not be a practical geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time. He who can read Sir Charles Lyell's grand work on the Principles of Geology, which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how incomprehensibly vast have been the past periods of time, may at once close this volume. Not that it suffices to study the Principles of Geology, or to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations, and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation or even each stratum. A man must for years examine for himself great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the sea at work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment, before he can hope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time, the monuments of which we see around us.

It is good to wander along lines of sea-coast, when formed of moderately hard rocks, and mark the process of degradation. The tides in most cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is reason to believe that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away rock. At last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall down, and these remaining fixed, have to be worn away, atom by atom, until reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then are more quickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by marine productions, showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff, which is undergoing degradation, we find that it is only here and there, along a short length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at the present time suffering. The appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base.

He who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores, will, I believe, be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts are worn away. The observations on this head by Hugh Miller, and by that excellent observer Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill, are most impressive. With the mind thus impressed, let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand feet in thickness, which, though probably formed at a quicker rate than many other deposits, yet, from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles, each of which bears the stamp of time, are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated. Let him remember Lyell's profound remark, that the thickness and extent of sedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which the earth's crust has elsewhere suffered. And what an amount of degradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries! Professor Ramsay has given me the maximum thickness, in most cases from actual measurement, in a few cases from estimate, of each formation in different parts of Great Britain; and this is the result:—

Feet

Palaeozoic strata (not including igneous beds) 57154

Secondary strata 13190

Tertiary strata 2240



—making altogether 72584 feet; that is, very nearly thirteen and three-quarters British miles. Some of these formations, which are represented in England by thin beds, are thousands of feet in thickness on the Continent. Moreover, between each successive formation, we have, in the opinion of most geologists, enormously long blank periods. So that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in Britain, gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation; yet what time this must have consumed! Good observers have estimated that sediment is deposited by the great Mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a hundred thousand years. This estimate may be quite erroneous; yet, considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is transported by the currents of the sea, the process of accumulation in any one area must be extremely slow.

But the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered, independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter, probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time. I remember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation, when viewing volcanic islands, which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the lava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how far the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same story is still more plainly told by faults,—those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to the height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, the surface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea, that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible.

The Craven fault, for instance, extends for upwards of 30 miles, and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to 3000 feet. Professor Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in Anglesea of 2300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in Merionethshire of 12000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept away. The consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.

I am tempted to give one other case, the well-known one of the denudation of the Weald. Though it must be admitted that the denudation of the Weald has been a mere trifle, in comparison with that which has removed masses of our palaeozoic strata, in parts ten thousand feet in thickness, as shown in Professor Ramsay's masterly memoir on this subject. Yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the North Downs and to look at the distant South Downs; for, remembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and close, one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which must have covered up the Weald within so limited a period as since the latter part of the Chalk formation. The distance from the northern to the southern Downs is about 22 miles, and the thickness of the several formations is on an average about 1100 feet, as I am informed by Professor Ramsay. But if, as some geologists suppose, a range of older rocks underlies the Weald, on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere, the above estimate would be erroneous; but this source of doubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the district. If, then, we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height, we could measure the time requisite to have denuded the Weald. This, of course, cannot be done; but we may, in order to form some crude notion on the subject, assume that the sea would eat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century. This will at first appear much too small an allowance; but it is the same as if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty-two years. I doubt whether any rock, even as soft as chalk, would yield at this rate excepting on the most exposed coasts; though no doubt the degradation of a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen fragments. On the other hand, I do not believe that any line of coast, ten or twenty miles in length, ever suffers degradation at the same time along its whole indented length; and we must remember that almost all strata contain harder layers or nodules, which from long resisting attrition form a breakwater at the base. Hence, under ordinary circumstances, I conclude that for a cliff 500 feet in height, a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be an ample allowance. At this rate, on the above data, the denudation of the Weald must have required 306662400 years; or say three hundred million years.

The action of fresh water on the gently inclined Wealden district, when upraised, could hardly have been great, but it would somewhat reduce the above estimate. On the other hand, during oscillations of level, which we know this area has undergone, the surface may have existed for millions of years as land, and thus have escaped the action of the sea: when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods, it would, likewise, have escaped the action of the coast-waves. So that in all probability a far longer period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of the Secondary period.

I have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain some notion, however imperfect, of the lapse of years. During each of these years, over the whole world, the land and the water has been peopled by hosts of living forms. What an infinite number of generations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other in the long roll of years! Now turn to our richest geological museums, and what a paltry display we behold!




On the poorness of our Palaeontological collections.—That our palaeontological collections are very imperfect, is admitted by every one. The remark of that admirable palaeontologist, the late Edward Forbes, should not be forgotten, namely, that numbers of our fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens collected on some one spot. Only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as the important discoveries made every year in Europe prove. No organism wholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. I believe we are continually taking a most erroneous view, when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains. Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a formation conformably covered, after an enormous interval of time, by another and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. The remains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will when the beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation of rain-water. I suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved. For instance, the several species of the Chthamalinae (a sub-family of sessile cirripedes) coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly littoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is now known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the chalk period. The molluscan genus Chiton offers a partially analogous case.

With respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the Secondary and Palaeozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For instance, not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast periods, with one exception discovered by Sir C. Lyell in the carboniferous strata of North America. In regard to mammiferous remains, a single glance at the historical table published in the Supplement to Lyell's Manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and rare is their preservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their rarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations.

But the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from the several formations being separated from each other by wide intervals of time. When we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when we follow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive. But we know, for instance, from Sir R. Murchison's great work on Russia, what wide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed formations; so it is in North America, and in many other parts of the world. The most skilful geologist, if his attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories, would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country, great piles of sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had elsewhere been accumulated. And if in each separate territory, hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained. The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment has been derived, accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between each formation.

But we can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are almost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other in close sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many hundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised several hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological period. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna, tertiary beds are so scantily developed, that no record of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a distant age. A little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of the western side of South America, no extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found, though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great, from the enormous degradation of the coast-rocks and from muddy streams entering the sea. The explanation, no doubt, is, that the littoral and sub-littoral deposits are continually worn away, as soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of the coast-waves.

We may, I think, safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the incessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level. Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways; either, in profound depths of the sea, in which case, judging from the researches of E. Forbes, we may conclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then existed; or, sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. In this latter case, as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each other, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life, and thus a fossiliferous formation thick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount of degradation, may be formed.

I am convinced that all our ancient formations, which are rich in fossils, have thus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views on this subject in 1845, I have watched the progress of Geology, and have been surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that great formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of South America, which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will hardly last to a distant geological age, was certainly deposited during a downward oscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness.

All geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous slow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations have affected wide spaces. Consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation, may have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay. On the other hand, as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary, thick deposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts, which are the most favourable to life. Still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of elevation; or, to speak more accurately, the beds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the coast-action.

Thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered intermittent. I feel much confidence in the truth of these views, for they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by Sir C. Lyell; and E. Forbes independently arrived at a similar conclusion.

One remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation the area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be increased, and new stations will often be formed;—all circumstances most favourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties and species; but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the geological record. On the other hand, during subsidence, the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting the productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and consequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction, fewer new varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very periods of subsidence, that our great deposits rich in fossils have been accumulated. Nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking forms.

From the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological record, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we confine our attention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult to understand, why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close. Some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, but, as they are rare, they may be here passed over. Although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition, I can see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series of links between the species which then lived; but I can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following considerations.

Although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another. I am aware that two palaeontologists, whose opinions are worthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of specific forms. But insuperable difficulties, as it seems to me, prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head. When we see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation, it would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed. So again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited, it would be equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct. We forget how small the area of Europe is compared with the rest of the world; nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout Europe been correlated with perfect accuracy.

With marine animals of all kinds, we may safely infer a large amount of migration during climatal and other changes; and when we see a species first appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then first immigrated into that area. It is well known, for instance, that several species appeared somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic beds of North America than in those of Europe; time having apparently been required for their migration from the American to the European seas. In examining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world, it has everywhere been noted, that some few still existing species are common in the deposit, but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely, that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent in this particular deposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the Glacial period, which forms only a part of one whole geological period; and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level, on the inordinately great change of climate, on the prodigious lapse of time, all included within this same glacial period. Yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world, sedimentary deposits, including fossil remains, have gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period. It is not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi, within that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish; for we know what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of America during this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at different levels, owing to the migration of species and to geographical changes. And in the distant future, a geologist examining these beds, might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period, instead of having been really far greater, that is extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day.

In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on accumulating for a very long period, in order to have given sufficient time for the slow process of variation; hence the deposit will generally have to be a very thick one; and the species undergoing modification will have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time. But we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of subsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the same, which is necessary in order to enable the same species to live on the same space, the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount of subsidence. But this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency; for it has been observed by more than one palaeontologist, that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains, except near their upper or lower limits.

It would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of formations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its accumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed of beds of different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted, as a change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will generally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time. Nor will the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which its deposition has consumed. Many instances could be given of beds only a few feet in thickness, representing formations, elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their accumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. Many cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded, submerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same formation,—facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have occurred in its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest evidence in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition, which would never even have been suspected, had not the trees chanced to have been preserved: thus, Messrs. Lyell and Dawson found carboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient root-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight different levels. Hence, when the same species occur at the bottom, middle, and top of a formation, the probability is that they have not lived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition, but have disappeared and reappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period. So that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification during any one geological period, a section would not probably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed between them, but abrupt, though perhaps very slight, changes of form.

It is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little variability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species, unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate gradations. And this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section. Supposing B and C to be two species, and a third, A, to be found in an underlying bed; even if A were strictly intermediate between B and C, it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species, unless at the same time it could be most closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties. Nor should it be forgotten, as before explained, that A might be the actual progenitor of B and C, and yet might not at all necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of structure. So that we might obtain the parent-species and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation, and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations, we should not recognise their relationship, and should consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species.

It is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palaeontologists have founded their species; and they do this the more readily if the specimens come from different sub-stages of the same formation. Some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of D'Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties; and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find. Moreover, if we look to rather wider intervals, namely, to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation, we find that the embedded fossils, though almost universally ranked as specifically different, yet are far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in more widely separated formations; but to this subject I shall have to return in the following chapter.

One other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to suspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at first local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree. According to this view, the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot. Most marine animals have a wide range; and we have seen that with plants it is those which have the widest range, that oftenest present varieties; so that with shells and other marine animals, it is probably those which have had the widest range, far exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of Europe, which have oftenest given rise, first to local varieties and ultimately to new species; and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation.

It should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect specimens for examination, two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species, until many specimens have been collected from many places; and in the case of fossil species this could rarely be effected by palaeontologists. We shall, perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future period will be able to prove, that our different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether certain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of North America, which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their European representatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are really varieties or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. This could be effected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations; and such success seems to me improbable in the highest degree.

Geological research, though it has added numerous species to existing and extinct genera, and has made the intervals between some few groups less wide than they otherwise would have been, yet has done scarcely anything in breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting them together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties; and this not having been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the many objections which may be urged against my views. Hence it will be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks, under an imaginary illustration. The Malay Archipelago is of about the size of Europe from the North Cape to the Mediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined with any accuracy, excepting those of the United States of America. I fully agree with Mr. Godwin-Austen, that the present condition of the Malay Archipelago, with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas, probably represents the former state of Europe, when most of our formations were accumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of the richest regions of the whole world in organic beings; yet if all the species were to be collected which have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world!

But we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating. I suspect that not many of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked submarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or sand, would not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could be preserved.

In our archipelago, I believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed of sufficient thickness to last to an age, as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie in the past, only during periods of subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated from each other by enormous intervals, during which the area would be either stationary or rising; whilst rising, each fossiliferous formation would be destroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as we now see on the shores of South America. During the periods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods of elevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record would then be least perfect.

It may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would exceed the average duration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations between any two or more species. If such gradations were not fully preserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species. It is, also, probable that each great period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level, and that slight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods; and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate, and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one formation.

Very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines; and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these far-ranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties; and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place, but if possessed of any decided advantage, or when further modified and improved, they would slowly spread and supplant their parent-forms. When such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they would differ from their former state, in a nearly uniform, though perhaps extremely slight degree, they would, according to the principles followed by many palaeontologists, be ranked as new and distinct species.

If then, there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right to expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number of those fine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life. We ought only to look for a few links, some more closely, some more distantly related to each other; and these links, let them be ever so close, if found in different stages of the same formation, would, by most palaeontologists, be ranked as distinct species. But I do not pretend that I should ever have suspected how poor a record of the mutations of life, the best preserved geological section presented, had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each formation, pressed so hardly on my theory.




On the sudden appearance of whole groups of Allied Species.—The abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations, has been urged by several palaeontologists, for instance, by Agassiz, Pictet, and by none more forcibly than by Professor Sedgwick, as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous species, belonging to the same genera or families, have really started into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection. For the development of a group of forms, all of which have descended from some one progenitor, must have been an extremely slow process; and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their modified descendants. But we continually over-rate the perfection of the geological record, and falsely infer, because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain stage, that they did not exist before that stage. We continually forget how large the world is, compared with the area over which our geological formations have been carefully examined; we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe and of the United States. We do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time, which have probably elapsed between our consecutive formations,—longer perhaps in some cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation. These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from some one or some few parent-forms; and in the succeeding formation such species will appear as if suddenly created.

I may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life, for instance to fly through the air; but that when this had been effected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and widely throughout the world.

I will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks; and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced. I may recall the well-known fact that in geological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondary series; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series. Cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been discovered in India, South America, and in Europe even as far back as the eocene stage. The most striking case, however, is that of the Whale family; as these animals have huge bones, are marine, and range over the world, the fact of not a single bone of a whale having been discovered in any secondary formation, seemed fully to justify the belief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly produced in the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiary formation. But now we may read in the Supplement to Lyell's “Manual,” published in 1858, clear evidence of the existence of whales in the upper greensand, some time before the close of the secondary period.

I may give another instance, which from having passed under my own eyes has much struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I have stated that, from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species; from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the world, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting various zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms; from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds; from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised; from all these circumstances, I inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods, they would certainly have been preserved and discovered; and as not one species had been discovered in beds of this age, I concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding as I thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species. But my work had hardly been published, when a skilful palaeontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the chalk of Belgium. And, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this sessile cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous genus, of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum. Hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary period; and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many tertiary and existing species.

The case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the teleostean fishes, low down in the Chalk period. This group includes the large majority of existing species. Lately, Professor Pictet has carried their existence one sub-stage further back; and some palaeontologists believe that certain much older fishes, of which the affinities are as yet imperfectly known, are really teleostean. Assuming, however, that the whole of them did appear, as Agassiz believes, at the commencement of the chalk formation, the fact would certainly be highly remarkable; but I cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory, unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same period. It is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of the equator; and by running through Pictet's Palaeontology it will be seen that very few species are known from several formations in Europe. Some few families of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely developed in some one sea, might have spread widely. Nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at present. Even at this day, if the Malay Archipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian Ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great group of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain confined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and were enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or Australia, and thus reach other and distant seas.

From these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United States; and from the revolution in our palaeontological ideas on many points, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected, it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to discuss the number and range of its productions.




On the sudden appearance of groups of Allied Species in the lowest known fossiliferous strata.—There is another and allied difficulty, which is much graver. I allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group, suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. Most of the arguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group have descended from one progenitor, apply with nearly equal force to the earliest known species. For instance, I cannot doubt that all the Silurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must have lived long before the Silurian age, and which probably differed greatly from any known animal. Some of the most ancient Silurian animals, as the Nautilus, Lingula, etc., do not differ much from living species; and it cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong, for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate between them. If, moreover, they had been the progenitors of these orders, they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous and improved descendants.

Consequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the lowest Silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the whole interval from the Silurian age to the present day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods of time, the world swarmed with living creatures.

To the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several of the most eminent geologists, with Sir R. Murchison at their head, are convinced that we see in the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the dawn of life on this planet. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and the late E. Forbes, dispute this conclusion. We should not forget that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy. M. Barrande has lately added another and lower stage to the Silurian system, abounding with new and peculiar species. Traces of life have been detected in the Longmynd beds beneath Barrande's so-called primordial zone. The presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks, probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods. But the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata, which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the Silurian epoch, is very great. If these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation, or obliterated by metamorphic action, we ought to find only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these ought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition. But the descriptions which we now possess of the Silurian deposits over immense territories in Russia and in North America, do not support the view, that the older a formation is, the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation and metamorphism.

The case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it may hereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following hypothesis. From the nature of the organic remains, which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe and of the United States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of Europe and North America. But we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals between the successive formations; whether Europe and the United States during these intervals existed as dry land, or as a submarine surface near land, on which sediment was not deposited, or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea.

Looking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the land, we see them studded with many islands; but not one oceanic island is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palaeozoic or secondary formation. Hence we may perhaps infer, that during the palaeozoic and secondary periods, neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend; for had they existed there, palaeozoic and secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear; and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level, which we may fairly conclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods. If then we may infer anything from these facts, we may infer that where our oceans now extend, oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record; and on the other hand, that where continents now exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level, since the earliest silurian period. The coloured map appended to my volume on Coral Reefs, led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence, the great archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level, and the continents areas of elevation. But have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from eternity? Our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance, during many oscillations of level, of the force of elevation; but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a period immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch, continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out; and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now stand. Nor should we be justified in assuming that if, for instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now converted into a continent, we should there find formations older than the silurian strata, supposing such to have been formerly deposited; for it might well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always remained nearer to the surface. The immense areas in some parts of the world, for instance in South America, of bare metamorphic rocks, which must have been heated under great pressure, have always seemed to me to require some special explanation; and we may perhaps believe that we see in these large areas, the many formations long anterior to the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition.




The several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the many species which now exist or have existed; the sudden manner in which whole groups of species appear in our European formations; the almost entire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath the Silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature. We see this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent palaeontologists, namely Cuvier, Owen, Agassiz, Barrande, Falconer, E. Forbes, etc., and all our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, etc., have unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the immutability of species. But I have reason to believe that one great authority, Sir Charles Lyell, from further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject. I feel how rash it is to differ from these great authorities, to whom, with others, we owe all our knowledge. Those who think the natural geological record in any degree perfect, and who do not attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given in this volume, will undoubtedly at once reject my theory. For my part, following out Lyell's metaphor, I look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a few lines. Each word of the slowly-changing language, in which the history is supposed to be written, being more or less different in the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the apparently abruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our consecutive, but widely separated formations. On this view, the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished, or even disappear.





CHAPTER X　ON THE GEOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF ORGANIC BEINGS


On the slow and successive appearance of new species—On their different rates of change—Species once lost do not reappear—Groups of species follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species—On Extinction—On simultaneous changes in the forms of life throughout the world—On the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living species—On the state of development of ancient forms—On the succession of the same types within the same areas—Summary of preceding and present chapters.

Let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the geological succession of organic beings, better accord with the common view of the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual modification, through descent and natural selection.

New species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the land and in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages; and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them, and to make the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual. In some of the most recent beds, though undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one or two species are lost forms, and only one or two are new forms, having here appeared for the first time, either locally, or, as far as we know, on the face of the earth. If we may trust the observations of Philippi in Sicily, the successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual. The secondary formations are more broken; but, as Bronn has remarked, neither the appearance nor disappearance of their many now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation.

Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms. Falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the sub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs and all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking instance has lately been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason to believe that organisms, considered high in the scale of nature, change more quickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule. The amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, does not strictly correspond with the succession of our geological formations; so that between each two consecutive formations, the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree. Yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone some change. When a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth, we have reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears. The strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of the so-called “colonies” of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to reappear; but Lyell's explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory.

These several facts accord well with my theory. I believe in no fixed law of development, causing all the inhabitants of a country to change abruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process of modification must be extremely slow. The variability of each species is quite independent of that of all others. Whether such variability be taken advantage of by natural selection, and whether the variations be accumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a greater or lesser amount of modification in the varying species, depends on many complex contingencies,—on the variability being of a beneficial nature, on the power of intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly changing physical conditions of the country, and more especially on the nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into competition. Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing, that it should change less. We see the same fact in geographical distribution; for instance, in the land-shells and coleopterous insects of Madeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of Europe, whereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered. We can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower productions, by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a former chapter. When many of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of competition, and on that of the many all-important relations of organism to organism, that any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved, will be liable to be exterminated. Hence we can see why all the species in the same region do at last, if we look to wide enough intervals of time, become modified; for those which do not change will become extinct.

In members of the same class the average amount of change, during long and equal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the accumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous formations depends on great masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding, our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent intervals; consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal. Each formation, on this view, does not mark a new and complete act of creation, but only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in a slowly changing drama.

We can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never reappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and inorganic, should recur. For though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it; yet the two forms—the old and the new—would not be identically the same; for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors. For instance, it is just possible, if our fantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long ages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also destroyed, and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parent-form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring, it is quite incredible that a fantail, identical with the existing breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even from the other well-established races of the domestic pigeon, for the newly-formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences.

Groups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species, changing more or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. A group does not reappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence, as long as it lasts, is continuous. I am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly few, so few, that E. Forbes, Pictet, and Woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as I maintain) admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with my theory. For as all the species of the same group have descended from some one species, it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages, so long must its members have continuously existed, in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms. Species of the genus Lingula, for instance, must have continuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations, from the lowest Silurian stratum to the present day.

We have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes falsely appear to have come in abruptly; and I have attempted to give an explanation of this fact, which if true would have been fatal to my views. But such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradual increase in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or later, it gradually decreases. If the number of the species of a genus, or the number of the genera of a family, be represented by a vertical line of varying thickness, crossing the successive geological formations in which the species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then gradually thickens upwards, sometimes keeping for a space of equal thickness, and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease and final extinction of the species. This gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable with my theory; as the species of the same genus, and the genera of the same family, can increase only slowly and progressively; for the process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradual,—one species giving rise first to two or three varieties, these being slowly converted into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree from a single stem, till the group becomes large.




On Extinction.—We have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of species. On the theory of natural selection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately connected together. The old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes, is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie de Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, etc., whose general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion. On the contrary, we have every reason to believe, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and groups of species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one spot, then from another, and finally from the world. Both single species and whole groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups, as we have seen, having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the present day; some having disappeared before the close of the palaeozoic period. No fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any single species or any single genus endures. There is reason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process than their production: if the appearance and disappearance of a group of species be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying thickness, the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end, which marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower end, which marks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species. In some cases, however, the extermination of whole groups of beings, as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period, has been wonderfully sudden.

The whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery. Some authors have even supposed that as the individual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite duration. No one I think can have marvelled more at the extinction of species, than I have done. When I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other extinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a very late geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for seeing that the horse, since its introduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate, I asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable. But how utterly groundless was my astonishment! Professor Owen soon perceived that the tooth, though so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an extinct species. Had this horse been still living, but in some degree rare, no naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all countries. If we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that something is, we can hardly ever tell. On the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in South America, that under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole continent. But we could not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase, whether some one or several contingencies, and at what period of the horse's life, and in what degree, they severally acted. If the conditions had gone on, however slowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have perceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct;—its place being seized on by some more successful competitor.

It is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies; and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity, and finally extinction. We see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations, that rarity precedes extinction; and we know that this has been the progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated, either locally or wholly, through man's agency. I may repeat what I published in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct—to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species, and yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist, is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death—to feel no surprise at sickness, but when the sick man dies, to wonder and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence.

The theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new variety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and the consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably follows. It is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported far and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other breeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial, are bound together. In certain flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated; but we know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least during the later geological periods, so that looking to later times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms.

The competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained and illustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each other in all respects. Hence the improved and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species; and if many new forms have been developed from any one species, the nearest allies of that species, i.e. the species of the same genus, will be the most liable to extermination. Thus, as I believe, a number of new species descended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to supplant an old genus, belonging to the same family. But it must often have happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and thus caused its extermination; and if many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder, many will have to yield their places; and it will generally be allied forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common. But whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class, which yield their places to other species which have been modified and improved, a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved, from being fitted to some peculiar line of life, or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station, where they have escaped severe competition. For instance, a single species of Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary formations, survives in the Australian seas; and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters. Therefore the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have seen, a slower process than its production.

With respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period and of Ammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between our consecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination. Moreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of a new area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied, for they will partake of some inferiority in common.

Thus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory of natural selection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many complex contingencies, on which the existence of each species depends. If we forget for an instant, that each species tends to increase inordinately, and that some check is always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured. Whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant in individuals than that; why this species and not another can be naturalised in a given country; then, and not till then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this particular species or group of species.




On the Forms of Life changing almost simultaneously throughout the World.—Scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact, that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many distant parts of the world, under the most different climates, where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North America, in equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope, and in the peninsula of India. For at these distant points, the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to those of the Chalk. It is not that the same species are met with; for in some cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to the same families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture. Moreover other forms, which are not found in the Chalk of Europe, but which occur in the formations either above or below, are similarly absent at these distant points of the world. In the several successive palaeozoic formations of Russia, Western Europe and North America, a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors: so it is, according to Lyell, with the several European and North American tertiary deposits. Even if the few fossil species which are common to the Old and New Worlds be kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in the successive forms of life, in the stages of the widely separated palaeozoic and tertiary periods, would still be manifest, and the several formations could be easily correlated.

These observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of distant parts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the same parallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the Megatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought to Europe from La Plata, without any information in regard to their geological position, no one would have suspected that they had coexisted with still living sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters coexisted with the Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages.

When the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this expression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year, or even that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine animals which live at the present day in Europe, and all those that lived in Europe during the pleistocene period (an enormously remote period as measured by years, including the whole glacial epoch), were to be compared with those now living in South America or in Australia, the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the pleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere. So, again, several highly competent observers believe that the existing productions of the United States are more closely related to those which lived in Europe during certain later tertiary stages, than to those which now live here; and if this be so, it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of North America would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older European beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can, I think, be little doubt that all the more modern marine formations, namely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds, of Europe, North and South America, and Australia, from containing fossil remains in some degree allied, and from not including those forms which are only found in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological sense.

The fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above large sense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those admirable observers, MM. de Verneuil and d'Archiac. After referring to the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe, they add, “If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to North America, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena, it will appear certain that all these modifications of species, their extinction, and the introduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and temporary, but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal kingdom.” M. Barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect. It is, indeed, quite futile to look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world, under the most different climates. We must, as Barrande has remarked, look to some special law. We shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is the relation between the physical conditions of various countries, and the nature of their inhabitants.

This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection. New species are formed by new varieties arising, which have some advantage over older forms; and those forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country, would naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species; for these latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to survive. We have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest in their own homes, and are most widely diffused, having produced the greatest number of new varieties. It is also natural that the dominant, varying, and far-spreading species, which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species, should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to new varieties and species. The process of diffusion may often be very slow, being dependent on climatal and geographical changes, or on strange accidents, but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in spreading. The diffusion would, it is probable, be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea. We might therefore expect to find, as we apparently do find, a less strict degree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the sea.

Dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more dominant species, and then their triumphant course, or even their existence, would cease. We know not at all precisely what are all the conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant species; but we can, I think, clearly see that a number of individuals, from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations, and that severe competition with many already existing forms, would be highly favourable, as would be the power of spreading into new territories. A certain amount of isolation, recurring at long intervals of time, would probably be also favourable, as before explained. One quarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant species on the land, and another for those in the waters of the sea. If two great regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an equal degree, whenever their inhabitants met, the battle would be prolonged and severe; and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be victorious. But in the course of time, the forms dominant in the highest degree, wherever produced, would tend everywhere to prevail. As they prevailed, they would cause the extinction of other and inferior forms; and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance, whole groups would tend slowly to disappear; though here and there a single member might long be enabled to survive.

Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense, simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world, accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus produced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance, and to having already had some advantage over their parents or over other species; these again spreading, varying, and producing new species. The forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common; and therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world, old groups will disappear from the world; and the succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond.

There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I have given my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous formations were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that blank intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from other parts of the world. As we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we are far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements. When two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly, but not exactly the same period, we should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life; but the species would not exactly correspond; for there will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and immigration.

I suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in Europe. Mr. Prestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two countries; but when he compares certain stages in England with those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for, considering the proximity of the two areas,—unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. Lyell has made similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations. Barrande, also, shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive Silurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the species. If the several formations in these regions have not been deposited during the same exact periods,—a formation in one region often corresponding with a blank interval in the other,—and if in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals of time between them; in this case, the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order, in accordance with the general succession of the form of life, and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions.




On the Affinities of extinct Species to each other, and to living forms.—Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species. They all fall into one grand natural system; and this fact is at once explained on the principle of descent. The more ancient any form is, the more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland long ago remarked, all fossils can be classed either in still existing groups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill up the wide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot be disputed. For if we confine our attention either to the living or to the extinct alone, the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one general system. With respect to the Vertebrata, whole pages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great palaeontologist, Owen, showing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups. Cuvier ranked the Ruminants and Pachyderms, as the two most distinct orders of mammals; but Owen has discovered so many fossil links, that he has had to alter the whole classification of these two orders; and has placed certain pachyderms in the same sub-order with ruminants: for example, he dissolves by fine gradations the apparently wide difference between the pig and the camel. In regard to the Invertebrata, Barrande, and a higher authority could not be named, asserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic animals, though belonging to the same orders, families, or genera with those living at the present day, were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are.

Some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being considered as intermediate between living species or groups. If by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms, the objection is probably valid. But I apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species would have to stand between living species, and some extinct genera between living genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families. The most common case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish and reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a dozen characters, the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters, so that the two groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that period made some small approach to each other.

It is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated from each other. This remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of geological ages; and it would be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition, for every now and then even a living animal, as the Lepidosiren, is discovered having affinities directed towards very distinct groups. Yet if we compare the older Reptiles and Batrachians, the older Fish, the older Cephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the more recent members of the same classes, we must admit that there is some truth in the remark.

Let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the theory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat complex, I must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter. We may suppose that the numbered letters represent genera, and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus. The diagram is much too simple, too few genera and too few species being given, but this is unimportant for us. The horizontal lines may represent successive geological formations, and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered 14 14 as extinct. The three existing genera, a14, q14, p14, will form a small family; b14 and f14 a closely allied family or sub-family; and o14, e14, m14, a third family. These three families, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the parent-form A, will form an order; for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient and common progenitor. On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of character, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more recent any form is, the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor. Hence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms. We must not, however, assume that divergence of character is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature. Therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics. This is represented in the diagram by the letter F14.

All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from A, make, as before remarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present day.

By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms, supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered at several points low down in the series, the three existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. If, for instance, the genera a1, a5, a5, f8, m3, m6, m9 were disinterred, these three families would be so closely linked together that they probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms. Yet he who objected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living genera of three families together, intermediate in character, would be justified, as they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms. If many extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological formations—for instance, above No. VI.—but none from beneath this line, then only the two families on the left hand (namely, a14, etc., and b14, etc.) would have to be united into one family; and the two other families (namely, a14 to f14 now including five genera, and o14 to m14) would yet remain distinct. These two families, however, would be less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the fossils. If, for instance, we suppose the existing genera of the two families to differ from each other by a dozen characters, in this case the genera, at the early period marked VI., would differ by a lesser number of characters; for at this early stage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common progenitor of the order, nearly so much as they subsequently diverged. Thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants, or between their collateral relations.

In nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the diagram; for the groups will have been more numerous, they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will have been modified in various degrees. As we possess only the last volume of the geological record, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right to expect, except in very rare cases, to fill up wide intervals in the natural system, and thus unite distinct families or orders. All that we have a right to expect, is that those groups, which have within known geological periods undergone much modification, should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of the same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists seems frequently to be the case.

Thus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other and to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner. And they are wholly inexplicable on any other view.

On this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great period in the earth's history will be intermediate in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus, the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms, and for the coming in of quite new forms by immigration, and for a large amount of modification, during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations. Subject to these allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas. I need give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the Devonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous, and underlying Silurian system. But each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations.

It is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule. For instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr. Falconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities and then according to their periods of existence, do not accord in arrangement. The species extreme in character are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor are those which are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. But supposing for an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect, we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths of time: a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced, especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts. To compare small things with great: if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production, and still less with the order of their disappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties between the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated earlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the series in this same respect.

Closely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character, is the fact, insisted on by all palaeontologists, that fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils from two remote formations. Pictet gives as a well-known instance, the general resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the chalk formation, though the species are distinct in each stage. This fact alone, from its generality, seems to have shaken Professor Pictet in his firm belief in the immutability of species. He who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the globe, will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely consecutive formations, by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same. Let it be remembered that the forms of life, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world, and therefore under the most different climates and conditions. Consider the prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period, which includes the whole glacial period, and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected.

On the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains from closely consecutive formations, though ranked as distinct species, being closely related, is obvious. As the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as I attempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or two formations all the intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods; but we ought to find after intervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long as measured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been called by some authors, representative species; and these we assuredly do find. We find, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of specific forms, as we have a just right to expect to find.




On the state of Development of Ancient Forms.—There has been much discussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient. I will not here enter on this subject, for naturalists have not as yet defined to each other's satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms. But in one particular sense the more recent forms must, on my theory, be higher than the more ancient; for each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for life over other and preceding forms. If under a nearly similar climate, the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter, the eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated; as would a secondary fauna by an eocene, and a palaeozoic fauna by a secondary fauna. I do not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of life, in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms; but I can see no way of testing this sort of progress. Crustaceans, for instance, not the highest in their own class, may have beaten the highest molluscs. From the extraordinary manner in which European productions have recently spread over New Zealand, and have seized on places which must have been previously occupied, we may believe, if all the animals and plants of Great Britain were set free in New Zealand, that in the course of time a multitude of British forms would become thoroughly naturalized there, and would exterminate many of the natives. On the other hand, from what we see now occurring in New Zealand, and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere having become wild in any part of Europe, we may doubt, if all the productions of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain, whether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants and animals. Under this point of view, the productions of Great Britain may be said to be higher than those of New Zealand. Yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of the two countries could not have foreseen this result.

Agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals of the same classes; or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological development of recent forms. I must follow Pictet and Huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved. Yet I fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed, at least in regard to subordinate groups, which have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times. For this doctrine of Agassiz accords well with the theory of natural selection. In a future chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of successive generations, more and more difference to the adult.

Thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature, of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. This view may be true, and yet it may never be capable of full proof. Seeing, for instance, that the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly belong to their own proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds far beneath the lowest Silurian strata are discovered—a discovery of which the chance is very small.




On the Succession of the same Types within the same areas, during the later tertiary periods.—Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the Australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that continent. In South America, a similar relationship is manifest, even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor Owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals, buried there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was so much impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845, on this “law of the succession of types,”—on “this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living.” Professor Owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the Old World. We see the same law in this author's restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of New Zealand. We see it also in the birds of the caves of Brazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with sea-shells, but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs, it is not well displayed by them. Other cases could be added, as the relation between the extinct and living land-shells of Madeira; and between the extinct and living brackish-water shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.

Now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types within the same areas mean? He would be a bold man, who after comparing the present climate of Australia and of parts of South America under the same latitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand, by dissimilar physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents, and, on the other hand, by similarity of conditions, for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods. Nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in Australia; or that Edentata and other American types should have been solely produced in South America. For we know that Europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials; and I have shown in the publications above alluded to, that in America the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it now is. North America formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was formerly more closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern half. In a similar manner we know from Falconer and Cautley's discoveries, that northern India was formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa than it is at the present time. Analogous facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals.

On the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long enduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the same areas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next succeeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified descendants. If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another continent, so will their modified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree. But after very long intervals of time and after great geographical changes, permitting much inter-migration, the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms, and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present distribution.

It may be asked in ridicule, whether I suppose that the megatherium and other allied huge monsters have left behind them in South America the sloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate descendants. This cannot for an instant be admitted. These huge animals have become wholly extinct, and have left no progeny. But in the caves of Brazil, there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other characters to the species still living in South America; and some of these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species. It must not be forgotten that, on my theory, all the species of the same genus have descended from some one species; so that if six genera, each having eight species, be found in one geological formation, and in the next succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same number of species, then we may conclude that only one species of each of the six older genera has left modified descendants, constituting the six new genera. The other seven species of the old genera have all died out and have left no progeny. Or, which would probably be a far commoner case, two or three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six new genera; the other old species and the other whole genera having become utterly extinct. In failing orders, with the genera and species decreasing in numbers, as apparently is the case of the Edentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will have left modified blood-descendants.




Summary of the preceding and present Chapters.—I have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely imperfect; that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with care; that only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state; that the number both of specimens and of species, preserved in our museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation; that, owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation, enormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations; that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single formation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each formation is, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific forms; that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species are those which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new species; and that varieties have at first often been local. All these causes taken conjointly, must have tended to make the geological record extremely imperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps.

He who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will rightly reject my whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species, found in the several stages of the same great formation. He may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he may overlook how important a part migration must have played, when the formations of any one great region alone, as that of Europe, are considered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden coming in of whole groups of species. He may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited: I can answer this latter question only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we can see, where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended, and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the Silurian epoch; but that long before that period, the world may have presented a wholly different aspect; and that the older continents, formed of formations older than any known to us, may now all be in a metamorphosed condition, or may lie buried under the ocean.

Passing from these difficulties, all the other great leading facts in palaeontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with modification through natural selection. We can thus understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively; how species of different classes do not necessarily change together, or at the same rate, or in the same degree; yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some extent. The extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms. We can understand why when a species has once disappeared it never reappears. Groups of species increase in numbers slowly, and endure for unequal periods of time; for the process of modification is necessarily slow, and depends on many complex contingencies. The dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants, and thus new sub-groups and groups are formed. As these are formed, the species of the less vigorous groups, from their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor, tend to become extinct together, and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth. But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in protected and isolated situations. When a group has once wholly disappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been broken.

We can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which are those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to people the world with allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the productions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously.

We can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and recent, make together one grand system; for all are connected by generation. We can understand, from the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the more ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now living. Why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms, sometimes blending two groups previously classed as distinct into one; but more commonly only bringing them a little closer together. The more ancient a form is, the more often, apparently, it displays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be related to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups, since become widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms. We can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other, than are those of remote formations; for the forms are more closely linked together by generation: we can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in character.

The inhabitants of each successive period in the world's history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so far, higher in the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague yet ill-defined sentiment, felt by many palaeontologists, that organisation on the whole has progressed. If it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class, the fact will be intelligible. The succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious, and is simply explained by inheritance.

If then the geological record be as imperfect as I believe it to be, and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more perfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly diminished or disappear. On the other hand, all the chief laws of palaeontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have been produced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life, produced by the laws of variation still acting round us, and preserved by Natural Selection.





CHAPTER XI　GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION


Present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical conditions—Importance of barriers—Affinity of the productions of the same continent—Centres of creation—Means of dispersal, by changes of climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional means—Dispersal during the Glacial period co-extensive with the world

In considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions. Of late, almost every author who has studied the subject has come to this conclusion. The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove its truth: for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is almost continuous, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the New and Old Worlds; yet if we travel over the vast American continent, from the central parts of the United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the most diversified conditions; the most humid districts, arid deserts, lofty mountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes, and great rivers, under almost every temperature. There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old World which cannot be paralleled in the New—at least as closely as the same species generally require; for it is a most rare case to find a group of organisms confined to any small spot, having conditions peculiar in only a slight degree; for instance, small areas in the Old World could be pointed out hotter than any in the New World, yet these are not inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora. Notwithstanding this parallelism in the conditions of the Old and New Worlds, how widely different are their living productions!

In the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in Australia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes 25° and 35°, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions, yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar. Or again we may compare the productions of South America south of lat. 35° with those north of 25°, which consequently inhabit a considerably different climate, and they will be found incomparably more closely related to each other, than they are to the productions of Australia or Africa under nearly the same climate. Analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea.

A second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions. We see this in the great difference of nearly all the terrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the northern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly different climate, there might have been free migration for the northern temperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions. We see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of Australia, Africa, and South America under the same latitude: for these countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. On each continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts, and sometimes even of large rivers, we find different productions; though as mountain-chains, deserts, etc., are not as impassable, or likely to have endured so long as the oceans separating continents, the differences are very inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.

Turning to the sea, we find the same law. No two marine faunas are more distinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common, than those of the eastern and western shores of South and Central America; yet these great faunas are separated only by the narrow, but impassable, isthmus of Panama. Westward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends, with not an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of another kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the Pacific, with another and totally distinct fauna. So that here three marine faunas range far northward and southward, in parallel lines not far from each other, under corresponding climates; but from being separated from each other by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they are wholly distinct. On the other hand, proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter no impassable barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places, until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of Africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined and distinct marine faunas. Although hardly one shell, crab or fish is common to the above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western America and the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fish range from the Pacific into the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the Pacific and the eastern shores of Africa, on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude.

A third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statements, is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or sea, though the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations. It is a law of the widest generality, and every continent offers innumerable instances. Nevertheless the naturalist in travelling, for instance, from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings, specifically distinct, yet clearly related, replace each other. He hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes nearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite alike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the Straits of Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American ostrich), and northward the plains of La Plata by another species of the same genus; and not by a true ostrich or emeu, like those found in Africa and Australia under the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata, we see the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but they plainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the lofty peaks of the Cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the waters, and we do not find the beaver or musk-rat, but the coypu and capybara, rodents of the American type. Innumerable other instances could be given. If we look to the islands off the American shore, however much they may differ in geological structure, the inhabitants, though they may be all peculiar species, are essentially American. We may look back to past ages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find American types then prevalent on the American continent and in the American seas. We see in these facts some deep organic bond, prevailing throughout space and time, over the same areas of land and water, and independent of their physical conditions. The naturalist must feel little curiosity, who is not led to inquire what this bond is.

This bond, on my theory, is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as far as we positively know, produces organisms quite like, or, as we see in the case of varieties nearly like each other. The dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through natural selection, and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct influence of different physical conditions. The degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having been effected with more or less ease, at periods more or less remote;—on the nature and number of the former immigrants;—and on their action and reaction, in their mutual struggles for life;—the relation of organism to organism being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of all relations. Thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by checking migration; as does time for the slow process of modification through natural selection. Widely-ranging species, abounding in individuals, which have already triumphed over many competitors in their own widely-extended homes will have the best chance of seizing on new places, when they spread into new countries. In their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions, and will frequently undergo further modification and improvement; and thus they will become still further victorious, and will produce groups of modified descendants. On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can understand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, and even families are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously the case.

I believe, as was remarked in the last chapter, in no law of necessary development. As the variability of each species is an independent property, and will be taken advantage of by natural selection, only so far as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life, so the degree of modification in different species will be no uniform quantity. If, for instance, a number of species, which stand in direct competition with each other, migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they will be little liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything. These principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations with each other, and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological period, so certain species have migrated over vast spaces, and have not become greatly modified.

On these views, it is obvious, that the several species of the same genus, though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must originally have proceeded from the same source, as they have descended from the same progenitor. In the case of those species, which have undergone during whole geological periods but little modification, there is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the same region; for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since ancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. But in many other cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times, there is great difficulty on this head. It is also obvious that the individuals of the same species, though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must have proceeded from one spot, where their parents were first produced: for, as explained in the last chapter, it is incredible that individuals identically the same should ever have been produced through natural selection from parents specifically distinct.

We are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by naturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more points of the earth's surface. Undoubtedly there are very many cases of extreme difficulty, in understanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated points, where now found. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced within a single region captivates the mind. He who rejects it, rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is universally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is continuous; and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from each other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the space could not be easily passed over by migration, the fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional. The capacity of migrating across the sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals, than perhaps in any other organic beings; and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable cases of the same mammal inhabiting distant points of the world. No geologist will feel any difficulty in such cases as Great Britain having been formerly united to Europe, and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds. But if the same species can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a single mammal common to Europe and Australia or South America? The conditions of life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of European animals and plants have become naturalised in America and Australia; and some of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and southern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe, is, that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from their varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the vast and broken interspace. The great and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had on distribution, is intelligible only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced on one side alone, and have not been able to migrate to the other side. Some few families, many sub-families, very many genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera are confined to a single region; and it has been observed by several naturalists, that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each other, are generally local, or confined to one area. What a strange anomaly it would be, if, when coming one step lower in the series, to the individuals of the same species, a directly opposite rule prevailed; and species were not local, but had been produced in two or more distinct areas!

Hence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most probable. Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other. But the geographical and climatal changes, which have certainly occurred within recent geological times, must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous the formerly continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered probable by general considerations, that each species has been produced within one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases. But after some preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most striking classes of facts; namely, the existence of the same species on the summits of distant mountain-ranges, and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic regions; and secondly (in the following chapter), the wide distribution of freshwater productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the mainland, though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea. If the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earth's surface, can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace; then, considering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and various occasional means of transport, the belief that this has been the universal law, seems to me incomparably the safest.

In discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time to consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several distinct species of a genus, which on my theory have all descended from a common progenitor, can have migrated (undergoing modification during some part of their migration) from the area inhabited by their progenitor. If it can be shown to be almost invariably the case, that a region, of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to, or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region, has probably received at some former period immigrants from this other region, my theory will be strengthened; for we can clearly understand, on the principle of modification, why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of another region, whence it has been stocked. A volcanic island, for instance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time a few colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be plainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent. Cases of this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter more fully see, inexplicable on the theory of independent creation. This view of the relation of species in one region to those in another, does not differ much (by substituting the word variety for species) from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper by Mr. Wallace, in which he concludes, that “every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre-existing closely allied species.” And I now know from correspondence, that this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification.

The previous remarks on “single and multiple centres of creation” do not directly bear on another allied question,—namely whether all the individuals of the same species have descended from a single pair, or single hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many individuals simultaneously created. With those organic beings which never intercross (if such exist), the species, on my theory, must have descended from a succession of improved varieties, which will never have blended with other individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted each other; so that, at each successive stage of modification and improvement, all the individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent. But in the majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which often intercross, I believe that during the slow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification will not have been due, at each stage, to descent from a single parent. To illustrate what I mean: our English racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations.

Before discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of “single centres of creation,” I must say a few words on the means of dispersal.




Means of Dispersal.—Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject. I can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts. Change of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration: a region when its climate was different may have been a high road for migration, but now be impassable; I shall, however, presently have to discuss this branch of the subject in some detail. Changes of level in the land must also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been submerged, and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended: where the sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected islands or possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. No geologist will dispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms. Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the Atlantic must recently have been connected with Europe or Africa, and Europe likewise with America. Other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean, and have united almost every island to some mainland. If indeed the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to some continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and removes many a difficulty: but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species. It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations of level in our continents; but not of such vast changes in their position and extension, as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. I freely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried beneath the sea, which may have served as halting places for plants and for many animals during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked, as I believe, by rings of coral or atolls standing over them. Whenever it is fully admitted, as I believe it will some day be, that each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the course of time we know something definite about the means of distribution, we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land. But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recent period continents which are now quite separate, have been continuously, or almost continuously, united with each other, and with the many existing oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution,—such as the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent,—the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants,—a certain degree of relation (as we shall hereafter see) between the distribution of mammals and the depth of the sea,—these and other such facts seem to me opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period, as are necessitated on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by his many followers. The nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents. Nor does their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken continents;—if they had originally existed as mountain-ranges on the land, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other mountain-summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous or other such rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.

I must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but which more properly might be called occasional means of distribution. I shall here confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for transport across the sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly unknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley's aid, a few experiments, it was not even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of sea-water. To my surprise I found that out of 87 kinds, 64 germinated after an immersion of 28 days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days. For convenience sake I chiefly tried small seeds, without the capsule or fruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured by the salt-water. Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, etc., and some of these floated for a long time. It is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that floods might wash down plants or branches, and that these might be dried on the banks, and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea. Hence I was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and to place them on sea water. The majority sank quickly, but some which whilst green floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer; for instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried, they floated for 90 days and afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated for 85 days, and the seeds afterwards germinated: the ripe seeds of Helosciadium sank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90 days, and afterwards germinated. Altogether out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for above 28 days, and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period. So that as seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days; and as plants with ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment) floated, after being dried, for above 28 days, as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts, we may conclude that the seeds of plants of any country might be floated by sea-currents during 28 days, and would retain their power of germination. In Johnston's Physical Atlas, the average rate of the several Atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem (some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem); on this average, the seeds of plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if blown to a favourable spot by an inland gale, they would germinate.

Subsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a much better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. On the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as we have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer. The result was that of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then capable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments. Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate. The fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is interesting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means; and Alph. de Candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges.

But seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift timber is thrown up on most islands, even on those in the midst of the widest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the Pacific, procure stones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these stones being a valuable royal tax. I find on examination, that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them,—so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest transport: out of one small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old, three dicotyledonous plants germinated: I am certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again, I can show that the carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape being immediately devoured; and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches, for instance, are killed by even a few days' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial salt-water for 30 days, to my surprise nearly all germinated.

Living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean. We may I think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour; and some authors have given a far higher estimate. I have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit will pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the course of two months, I picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small birds, and these seemed perfect, and some of them, which I tried, germinated. But the following fact is more important: the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not in the least injure, as I know by trial, the germination of seeds; now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours. A bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles, and hawks are known to look out for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered. Mr. Brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up flying carrier-pigeons from France to England, as the hawks on the English coast destroyed so many on their arrival. Some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the Zoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of the oat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours. Freshwater fish, I find, eat seeds of many land and water plants: fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place. I forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles, storks, and pelicans; these birds after an interval of many hours, either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and several of these seeds retained their power of germination. Certain seeds, however, were always killed by this process.

Although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, I can show that earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance I removed twenty-two grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge, and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch. Thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great distances; for many facts could be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds. Reflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the Mediterranean; and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minute seeds? But I shall presently have to recur to this subject.

As icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and have even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, I can hardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions, as suggested by Lyell; and during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another. In the Azores, from the large number of the species of plants common to Europe, in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands nearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson) from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude, I suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds, during the Glacial epoch. At my request Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands, and he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks, which do not occur in the archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these mid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of northern plants.

Considering that the several above means of transport, and that several other means, which without doubt remain to be discovered, have been in action year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of years, it would I think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported. These means of transport are sometimes called accidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are not accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of seawater; nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however, would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring island, but not from one distant continent to another. The floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great degree; but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be. The currents, from their course, would never bring seeds from North America to Britain, though they might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our western shores, where, if not killed by so long an immersion in salt-water, they could not endure our climate. Almost every year, one or two land-birds are blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the western shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be transported by these wanderers only by one means, namely, in dirt sticking to their feet, which is in itself a rare accident. Even in this case, how small would the chance be of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But it would be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island, like Great Britain, has not, as far as is known (and it would be very difficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries, through occasional means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any other continent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from the mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means. I do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far less well-stocked than Britain, scarcely more than one would be so well fitted to its new home, as to become naturalised. But this, as it seems to me, is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means of transport, during the long lapse of geological time, whilst an island was being upheaved and formed, and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants. On almost bare land, with few or no destructive insects or birds living there, nearly every seed, which chanced to arrive, would be sure to germinate and survive.




Dispersal during the Glacial period.—The identity of many plants and animals, on mountain-summits, separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands, where the Alpine species could not possibly exist, is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant points, without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one to the other. It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the extreme northern parts of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the plants on the White Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the same with those of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa Gray, with those on the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as 1747, such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the same species must have been independently created at several distinct points; and we might have remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid attention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see, affords a simple explanation of these facts. We have evidence of almost every conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that within a very recent geological period, central Europe and North America suffered under an Arctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale more plainly, than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with their scored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly has the climate of Europe changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic moraines, left by old glaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize. Throughout a large part of the United States, erratic boulders, and rocks scored by drifted icebergs and coast-ice, plainly reveal a former cold period.

The former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the inhabitants of Europe, as explained with remarkable clearness by Edward Forbes, is substantially as follows. But we shall follow the changes more readily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on, and then pass away, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and as each more southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and ill-fitted for their former more temperate inhabitants, the latter would be supplanted and arctic productions would take their places. The inhabitants of the more temperate regions would at the same time travel southward, unless they were stopped by barriers, in which case they would perish. The mountains would become covered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains. By the time that the cold had reached its maximum, we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora, covering the central parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even stretching into Spain. The now temperate regions of the United States would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals, and these would be nearly the same with those of Europe; for the present circumpolar inhabitants, which we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward, are remarkably uniform round the world. We may suppose that the Glacial period came on a little earlier or later in North America than in Europe, so will the southern migration there have been a little earlier or later; but this will make no difference in the final result.

As the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward, closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate regions. And as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains, the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground, always ascending higher and higher, as the warmth increased, whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same arctic species, which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands of the Old and New Worlds, would be left isolated on distant mountain-summits (having been exterminated on all lesser heights) and in the arctic regions of both hemispheres.

Thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as on the mountains of the United States and of Europe. We can thus also understand the fact that the Alpine plants of each mountain-range are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due north of them: for the migration as the cold came on, and the re-migration on the returning warmth, will generally have been due south and north. The Alpine plants, for example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more especially allied to the plants of northern Scandinavia; those of the United States to Labrador; those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic regions of that country. These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic productions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we find the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude without other evidence, that a colder climate permitted their former migration across the low intervening tracts, since become too warm for their existence.

If the climate, since the Glacial period, has ever been in any degree warmer than at present (as some geologists in the United States believe to have been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the fossil Gnathodon), then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have marched a little further north, and subsequently have retreated to their present homes; but I have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period, since the Glacial period.

The arctic forms, during their long southern migration and re-migration northward, will have been exposed to nearly the same climate, and, as is especially to be noticed, they will have kept in a body together; consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed, and, in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, they will not have been liable to much modification. But with our Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have been somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other, and have survived there ever since; they will, also, in all probability have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the Glacial epoch, and which during its coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains; they will, also, have been exposed to somewhat different climatal influences. Their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed; consequently they will have been liable to modification; and this we find has been the case; for if we compare the present Alpine plants and animals of the several great European mountain-ranges, though very many of the species are identically the same, some present varieties, some are ranked as doubtful forms, and some few are distinct yet closely allied or representative species.

In illustrating what, as I believe, actually took place during the Glacial period, I assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day. But the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms, but also to many sub-arctic and to some few northern temperate forms, for some of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of North America and Europe; and it may be reasonably asked how I account for the necessary degree of uniformity of the sub-arctic and northern temperate forms round the world, at the commencement of the Glacial period. At the present day, the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds are separated from each other by the Atlantic Ocean and by the extreme northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than at present, they must have been still more completely separated by wider spaces of ocean. I believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by looking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature. We have good reason to believe that during the newer Pliocene period, before the Glacial epoch, and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now, the climate was warmer than at the present day. Hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate of latitude 60°, during the Pliocene period lived further north under the Polar Circle, in latitude 66°-67°; and that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now if we look at a globe, we shall see that under the Polar Circle there is almost continuous land from western Europe, through Siberia, to eastern America. And to this continuity of the circumpolar land, and to the consequent freedom for intermigration under a more favourable climate, I attribute the necessary amount of uniformity in the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.

Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to large, but partial oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these plants and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement of the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe, their descendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of Europe and the United States. On this view we can understand the relationship, with very little identity, between the productions of North America and Europe,—a relationship which is most remarkable, considering the distance of the two areas, and their separation by the Atlantic Ocean. We can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers, that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time; for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the inter-migration of their inhabitants.

During the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as the species in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated south of the Polar Circle, they must have been completely cut off from each other. This separation, as far as the more temperate productions are concerned, took place long ages ago. And as the plants and animals migrated southward, they will have become mingled in the one great region with the native American productions, and have had to compete with them; and in the other great region, with those of the Old World. Consequently we have here everything favourable for much modification,—for far more modification than with the Alpine productions, left isolated, within a much more recent period, on the several mountain-ranges and on the arctic lands of the two Worlds. Hence it has come, that when we compare the now living productions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find very few identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every great class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races, and others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct.

As on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration of a marine fauna, which during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period, was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar Circle, will account, on the theory of modification, for many closely allied forms now living in areas completely sundered. Thus, I think, we can understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern and western shores of temperate North America; and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana's admirable work), of some fish and other marine animals, in the Mediterranean and in the seas of Japan,—areas now separated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean.

These cases of relationship, without identity, of the inhabitants of seas now disjoined, and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the temperate lands of North America and Europe, are inexplicable on the theory of creation. We cannot say that they have been created alike, in correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas; for if we compare, for instance, certain parts of South America with the southern continents of the Old World, we see countries closely corresponding in all their physical conditions, but with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar.

But we must return to our more immediate subject, the Glacial period. I am convinced that Forbes's view may be largely extended. In Europe we have the plainest evidence of the cold period, from the western shores of Britain to the Oural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may infer, from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that Siberia was similarly affected. Along the Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines. South of the equator, we have some direct evidence of former glacial action in New Zealand; and the same plants, found on widely separated mountains in this island, tell the same story. If one account which has been published can be trusted, we have direct evidence of glacial action in the south-eastern corner of Australia.

Looking to America; in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock have been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat. 36°-37°, and on the shores of the Pacific, where the climate is now so different, as far south as lat. 46°; erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky Mountains. In the Cordillera of Equatorial South America, glaciers once extended far below their present level. In central Chile I was astonished at the structure of a vast mound of detritus, about 800 feet in height, crossing a valley of the Andes; and this I now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine, left far below any existing glacier. Further south on both sides of the continent, from lat. 41° to the southernmost extremity, we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action, in huge boulders transported far from their parent source.

We do not know that the Glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these several far distant points on opposite sides of the world. But we have good evidence in almost every case, that the epoch was included within the latest geological period. We have, also, excellent evidence, that it endured for an enormous time, as measured by years, at each point. The cold may have come on, or have ceased, earlier at one point of the globe than at another, but seeing that it endured for long at each, and that it was contemporaneous in a geological sense, it seems to me probable that it was, during a part at least of the period, actually simultaneous throughout the world. Without some distinct evidence to the contrary, we may at least admit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern and western sides of North America, in the Cordillera under the equator and under the warmer temperate zones, and on both sides of the southern extremity of the continent. If this be admitted, it is difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the whole world was at this period simultaneously cooler. But it would suffice for my purpose, if the temperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of longitude.

On this view of the whole world, or at least of broad longitudinal belts, having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole, much light can be thrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species. In America, Dr. Hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of Tierra del Fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora, are common to Europe, enormously remote as these two points are; and there are many closely allied species. On the lofty mountains of equatorial America a host of peculiar species belonging to European genera occur. On the highest mountains of Brazil, some few European genera were found by Gardner, which do not exist in the wide intervening hot countries. So on the Silla of Caraccas the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera characteristic of the Cordillera. On the mountains of Abyssinia, several European forms and some few representatives of the peculiar flora of the Cape of Good Hope occur. At the Cape of Good Hope a very few European species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and on the mountains, some few representative European forms are found, which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. On the Himalaya, and on the isolated mountain-ranges of the peninsula of India, on the heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of Java, many plants occur, either identically the same or representing each other, and at the same time representing plants of Europe, not found in the intervening hot lowlands. A list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of Java raises a picture of a collection made on a hill in Europe! Still more striking is the fact that southern Australian forms are clearly represented by plants growing on the summits of the mountains of Borneo. Some of these Australian forms, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, extend along the heights of the peninsula of Malacca, and are thinly scattered, on the one hand over India and on the other as far north as Japan.

On the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. Müller has discovered several European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur on the lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by Dr. Hooker, of European genera, found in Australia, but not in the intermediate torrid regions. In the admirable “Introduction to the Flora of New Zealand,” by Dr. Hooker, analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants of that large island. Hence we see that throughout the world, the plants growing on the more lofty mountains, and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern hemispheres, are sometimes identically the same; but they are much oftener specifically distinct, though related to each other in a most remarkable manner.

This brief abstract applies to plants alone: some strictly analogous facts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals. In marine productions, similar cases occur; as an example, I may quote a remark by the highest authority, Professor Dana, that “it is certainly a wonderful fact that New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea to Great Britain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world.” Sir J. Richardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New Zealand, Tasmania, etc., of northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker informs me that twenty-five species of Algae are common to New Zealand and to Europe, but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas.

It should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the southern parts of the southern hemisphere, and on the mountain-ranges of the intertropical regions, are not arctic, but belong to the northern temperate zones. As Mr. H. C. Watson has recently remarked, “In receding from polar towards equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain floras really become less and less arctic.” Many of the forms living on the mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere are of doubtful value, being ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct, by others as varieties; but some are certainly identical, and many, though closely related to northern forms, must be ranked as distinct species.

Now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts, on the belief, supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence, that the whole world, or a large part of it, was during the Glacial period simultaneously much colder than at present. The Glacial period, as measured by years, must have been very long; and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few centuries, this period will have been ample for any amount of migration. As the cold came slowly on, all the tropical plants and other productions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator, followed in the rear by the temperate productions, and these by the arctic; but with the latter we are not now concerned. The tropical plants probably suffered much extinction; how much no one can say; perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the Cape of Good Hope, and in parts of temperate Australia. As we know that many tropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold, many might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of temperature, more especially by escaping into the warmest spots. But the great fact to bear in mind is, that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. On the other hand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to the equator, though they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions, will have suffered less. And it is certain that many temperate plants, if protected from the inroads of competitors, can withstand a much warmer climate than their own. Hence, it seems to me possible, bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against intruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached or even crossed the equator. The invasion would, of course, have been greatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry climate; for Dr. Falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate. On the other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded an asylum to the tropical natives. The mountain-ranges north-west of the Himalaya, and the long line of the Cordillera, seem to have afforded two great lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact, lately communicated to me by Dr. Hooker, that all the flowering plants, about forty-six in number, common to Tierra del Fuego and to Europe still exist in North America, which must have lain on the line of march. But I do not doubt that some temperate productions entered and crossed even the lowlands of the tropics at the period when the cold was most intense,—when arctic forms had migrated some twenty-five degrees of latitude from their native country and covered the land at the foot of the Pyrenees. At this period of extreme cold, I believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven thousand feet. During this the coldest period, I suppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation, like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of the Himalaya, as graphically described by Hooker.

Thus, as I believe, a considerable number of plants, a few terrestrial animals, and some marine productions, migrated during the Glacial period from the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical regions, and some even crossed the equator. As the warmth returned, these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains, being exterminated on the lowlands; those which had not reached the equator, would re-migrate northward or southward towards their former homes; but the forms, chiefly northern, which had crossed the equator, would travel still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere. Although we have reason to believe from geological evidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification during their long southern migration and re-migration northward, the case may have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains, and in the southern hemisphere. These being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new forms of life; and it is probable that selected modifications in their structure, habits, and constitutions will have profited them. Thus many of these wanderers, though still plainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or southern hemispheres, now exist in their new homes as well-marked varieties or as distinct species.

It is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to America, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power, than the southern forms. And thus, when they became commingled during the Glacial period, the northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southern forms. Just in the same manner as we see at the present day, that very many European productions cover the ground in La Plata, and in a lesser degree in Australia, and have to a certain extent beaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part of Europe, though hides, wool, and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into Europe during the last two or three centuries from La Plata, and during the last thirty or forty years from Australia. Something of the same kind must have occurred on the intertropical mountains: no doubt before the Glacial period they were stocked with endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere largely yielded to the more dominant forms, generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north. In many islands the native productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised; and if the natives have not been actually exterminated, their numbers have been greatly reduced, and this is the first stage towards extinction. A mountain is an island on the land; and the intertropical mountains before the Glacial period must have been completely isolated; and I believe that the productions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north, just in the same way as the productions of real islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms, naturalised by man's agency.

I am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the intertropical regions. Very many difficulties remain to be solved. I do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and means of migration, or the reason why certain species and not others have migrated; why certain species have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms, and others have remained unaltered. We cannot hope to explain such facts, until we can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man's agency in a foreign land; why one ranges twice or thrice as far, and is twice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes.

I have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the most remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by Dr. Hooker in his botanical works on the antarctic regions. These cannot be here discussed. I will only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at points so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia, I believe that towards the close of the Glacial period, icebergs, as suggested by Lyell, have been largely concerned in their dispersal. But the existence of several quite distinct species, belonging to genera exclusively confined to the south, at these and other distant points of the southern hemisphere, is, on my theory of descent with modification, a far more remarkable case of difficulty. For some of these species are so distinct, that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the commencement of the Glacial period for their migration, and for their subsequent modification to the necessary degree. The facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre; and I am inclined to look in the southern, as in the northern hemisphere, to a former and warmer period, before the commencement of the Glacial period, when the antarctic lands, now covered with ice, supported a highly peculiar and isolated flora. I suspect that before this flora was exterminated by the Glacial epoch, a few forms were widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport, and by the aid, as halting-places, of existing and now sunken islands, and perhaps at the commencement of the Glacial period, by icebergs. By these means, as I believe, the southern shores of America, Australia, New Zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of vegetable life.

Sir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost identical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate on geographical distribution. I believe that the world has recently felt one of his great cycles of change; and that on this view, combined with modification through natural selection, a multitude of facts in the present distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained. The living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from the north and from the south, and to have crossed at the equator; but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely inundated the south. As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines, though rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountain-summits, in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the equator. The various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man, driven up and surviving in the mountain-fastnesses of almost every land, which serve as a record, full of interest to us, of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.





CHAPTER XII　GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION—continued


Distribution of fresh-water productions—On the inhabitants of oceanic islands—Absence of Batrachians and of terrestrial Mammals—On the relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland—On colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent modification—Summary of the last and present chapters

As lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of land, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not have ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently a still more impassable barrier, that they never would have extended to distant countries. But the case is exactly the reverse. Not only have many fresh-water species, belonging to quite different classes, an enormous range, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world. I well remember, when first collecting in the fresh waters of Brazil, feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects, shells, etc., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial beings, compared with those of Britain.

But this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though so unexpected, can, I think, in most cases be explained by their having become fitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence. We can here consider only a few cases. In regard to fish, I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents. But on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish in common and some different. A few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means; like that of the live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water. But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal of fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other. Instances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods, without any change of level. We have evidence in the loess of the Rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water shells. The wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountain-ranges, which from an early period must have parted river-systems and completely prevented their inosculation, seems to lead to this same conclusion. With respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very distant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient forms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration. In the second place, salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along the shores of the sea, and subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land.

Some species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and allied species, which, on my theory, are descended from a common parent and must have proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world. Their distribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds, and they are immediately killed by sea water, as are the adults. I could not even understand how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country. But two facts, which I have observed—and no doubt many others remain to be observed—throw some light on this subject. When a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with duck-weed, I have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back; and it has happened to me, in removing a little duck-weed from one aquarium to another, that I have quite unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water shells from the other. But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I suspended a duck's feet, which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond, in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were hatching; and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just hatched molluscs, though aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck's feet, in damp air, from twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any other distant point. Sir Charles Lyell also informs me that a Dyticus has been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly adhering to it; and a water-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once flew on board the “Beagle,” when forty-five miles distant from the nearest land: how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell.

With respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many fresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly shown, as remarked by Alph. de Candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants, which have only a very few aquatic members; for these latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in consequence, a very wide range. I think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact. I have before mentioned that earth occasionally, though rarely, adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. Wading birds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would be the most likely to have muddy feet. Birds of this order I can show are the greatest wanderers, and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea, so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet; when making land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water haunts. I do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here give only the most striking case: I took in February three table-spoonfuls of mud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little pond; this mud when dry weighed only ounces; I kept it covered up in my study for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew; the plants were of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering these facts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if water-birds did not transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to vast distances, and if consequently the range of these plants was not very great. The same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller fresh-water animals.

Other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have stated that fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow seeds of moderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton. Herons and other birds, century after century, have gone on daily devouring fish; they then take flight and go to other waters, or are blown across the sea; and we have seen that seeds retain their power of germination, when rejected in pellets or in excrement, many hours afterwards. When I saw the great size of the seeds of that fine water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph. de Candolle's remarks on this plant, I thought that its distribution must remain quite inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found the seeds of the great southern water-lily (probably, according to Dr. Hooker, the Nelumbium luteum) in a heron's stomach; although I do not know the fact, yet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting a hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach a pellet containing the seeds of the Nelumbium undigested; or the seeds might be dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the same way as fish are known sometimes to be dropped.

In considering these several means of distribution, it should be remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance, on a rising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species, however few, already occupying any pond, yet as the number of kinds is small, compared with those on the land, the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place, than in the case of terrestrial colonists. We should, also, remember that some, perhaps many, fresh-water productions are low in the scale of nature, and that we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high; and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species. We should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas, and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. But the wide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, I believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals, more especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight, and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water. Nature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them.




On the Inhabitants of Oceanic Islands.—We now come to the last of the three classes of facts, which I have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty, on the view that all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have descended from a single parent; and therefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace, notwithstanding that in the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the globe. I have already stated that I cannot honestly admit Forbes's view on continental extensions, which, if legitimately followed out, would lead to the belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined to some continent. This view would remove many difficulties, but it would not, I think, explain all the facts in regard to insular productions. In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to the mere question of dispersal; but shall consider some other facts, which bear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with modification.

The species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number compared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de Candolle admits this for plants, and Wollaston for insects. If we look to the large size and varied stations of New Zealand, extending over 780 miles of latitude, and compare its flowering plants, only 750 in number, with those on an equal area at the Cape of Good Hope or in Australia, we must, I think, admit that something quite independently of any difference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference in number. Even the uniform county of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764, but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers, and the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. We have evidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally possessed under half-a-dozen flowering plants; yet many have become naturalised on it, as they have on New Zealand and on every other oceanic island which can be named. In St. Helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native productions. He who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate species, will have to admit, that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands; for man has unintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature.

Although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty, the proportion of endemic species (i.e. those found nowhere else in the world) is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the number of the endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of the endemic birds in the Galapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then compare the area of the islands with that of the continent, we shall see that this is true. This fact might have been expected on my theory, for, as already explained, species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a new and isolated district, and having to compete with new associates, will be eminently liable to modification, and will often produce groups of modified descendants. But it by no means follows, that, because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar, those of another class, or of another section of the same class, are peculiar; and this difference seems to depend on the species which do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in a body, so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed. Thus in the Galapagos Islands nearly every land-bird, but only two out of the eleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than land-birds. Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same distance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from South America, and which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess one endemic land bird; and we know from Mr. J. M. Jones's admirable account of Bermuda, that very many North American birds, during their great annual migrations, visit either periodically or occasionally this island. Madeira does not possess one peculiar bird, and many European and African birds are almost every year blown there, as I am informed by Mr. E. V. Harcourt. So that these two islands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked by birds, which for long ages have struggled together in their former homes, and have become mutually adapted to each other; and when settled in their new homes, each kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits, and will consequently have been little liable to modification. Madeira, again, is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species of sea-shell is confined to its shores: now, though we do not know how sea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds, might be transported far more easily than land-shells, across three or four hundred miles of open sea. The different orders of insects in Madeira apparently present analogous facts.

Oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes, and their places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants; in the Galapagos Islands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds, take the place of mammals. In the plants of the Galapagos Islands, Dr. Hooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere. Such cases are generally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands; but this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful. Facility of immigration, I believe, has been at least as important as the nature of the conditions.

Many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of remote islands. For instance, in certain islands not tenanted by mammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds; yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds. This case presents no difficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might be transported to an island by some other means; and the plant then becoming slightly modified, but still retaining its hooked seeds, would form an endemic species, having as useless an appendage as any rudimentary organ,—for instance, as the shrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles. Again, islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown, generally have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. Hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous plant, though it would have no chance of successfully competing in stature with a fully developed tree, when established on an island and having to compete with herbaceous plants alone, might readily gain an advantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants. If so, natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous plants when growing on an island, to whatever order they belonged, and thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees.

With respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, Bory St. Vincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) have never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion, and I have found it strictly true. I have, however, been assured that a frog exists on the mountains of the great island of New Zealand; but I suspect that this exception (if the information be correct) may be explained through glacial agency. This general absence of frogs, toads, and newts on so many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions; indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals; for frogs have been introduced into Madeira, the Azores, and Mauritius, and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance. But as these animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed by sea-water, on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and therefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island. But why, on the theory of creation, they should not have been created there, it would be very difficult to explain.

Mammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched the oldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet I have not found a single instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. The Falkland Islands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an exception; but this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a bank connected with the mainland; moreover, icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly transported foxes, as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions. Yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals, for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands, if close to a continent; and hardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the ordinary view of creation, that there has not been time for the creation of mammals; many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary strata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes; and on continents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals. Though terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, a.rial mammals do occur on almost every island. New Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands, the Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their peculiar bats. Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this question can easily be answered; for no terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have been seen wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North American species either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda, at the distance of 600 miles from the mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has specially studied this family, that many of the same species have enormous ranges, and are found on continents and on far distant islands. Hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through natural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position, and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands, with the absence of all terrestrial mammals.

Besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of islands from continents, there is also a relation, to a certain extent independent of distance, between the depth of the sea separating an island from the neighbouring mainland, and the presence in both of the same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified condition. Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking observations on this head in regard to the great Malay Archipelago, which is traversed near Celebes by a space of deep ocean; and this space separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas. On either side the islands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks, and they are inhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds. No doubt some few anomalies occur in this great archipelago, and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through man's agency; but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of Mr. Wallace. I have not as yet had time to follow up this subject in all other quarters of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation generally holds good. We see Britain separated by a shallow channel from Europe, and the mammals are the same on both sides; we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similar channels from Australia. The West Indian Islands stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms in depth, and here we find American forms, but the species and even the genera are distinct. As the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse of time, and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated by deeper channels, we can understand the frequent relation between the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continent,—an inexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation.

All the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islands,—namely, the scarcity of kinds—the richness in endemic forms in particular classes or sections of classes,—the absence of whole groups, as of batrachians, and of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of a.rial bats,—the singular proportions of certain orders of plants,—herbaceous forms having been developed into trees, etc.,—seem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means of transport having been largely efficient in the long course of time, than with the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest continent; for on this latter view the migration would probably have been more complete; and if modification be admitted, all the forms of life would have been more equally modified, in accordance with the paramount importance of the relation of organism to organism.

I do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands, whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival, could have reached their present homes. But the probability of many islands having existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains, must not be overlooked. I will here give a single instance of one of the cases of difficulty. Almost all oceanic islands, even the most isolated and smallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but sometimes by species found elsewhere. Dr. Aug. A. Gould has given several interesting cases in regard to the land-shells of the islands of the Pacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells are very easily killed by salt; their eggs, at least such as I have tried, sink in sea-water and are killed by it. Yet there must be, on my view, some unknown, but highly efficient means for their transportal. Would the just-hatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the ground, and thus get transported? It occurred to me that land-shells, when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of the sea. And I found that several species did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days: one of these shells was the Helix pomatia, and after it had again hybernated I put it in sea-water for twenty days, and it perfectly recovered. As this species has a thick calcareous operculum, I removed it, and when it had formed a new membranous one, I immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and it recovered and crawled away: but more experiments are wanted on this head.

The most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being actually the same species. Numerous instances could be given of this fact. I will give only one, that of the Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the equator, between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America. Here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of the American continent. There are twenty-six land birds, and twenty-five of these are ranked by Mr. Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been created here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American species in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice, was manifest. So it is with the other animals, and with nearly all the plants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable memoir on the Flora of this archipelago. The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent, yet feels that he is standing on American land. Why should this be so? why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos Archipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the geological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together, which resembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand, there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between the Galapagos and Cape de Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape de Verde Islands are related to those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is obvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists, whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land, from America; and the Cape de Verde Islands from Africa; and that such colonists would be liable to modification;—the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace.

Many analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest continent, or of other near islands. The exceptions are few, and most of them can be explained. Thus the plants of Kerguelen Land, though standing nearer to Africa than to America, are related, and that very closely, as we know from Dr. Hooker's account, to those of America: but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears. New Zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to Australia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is what might have been expected; but it is also plainly related to South America, which, although the next nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that the fact becomes an anomaly. But this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both New Zealand, South America, and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point, namely from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation, before the commencement of the Glacial period. The affinity, which, though feeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the south-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good Hope, is a far more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity is confined to the plants, and will, I do not doubt, be some day explained.

The law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent, we sometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most interesting manner, within the limits of the same archipelago. Thus the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago are tenanted, as I have elsewhere shown, in a quite marvellous manner, by very closely related species; so that the inhabitants of each separate island, though mostly distinct, are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world. And this is just what might have been expected on my view, for the islands are situated so near each other that they would almost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source, or from each other. But this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may be used as an argument against my views; for it may be asked, how has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each other, having the same geological nature, the same height, climate, etc., that many of the immigrants should have been differently modified, though only in a small degree. This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but it arises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering the physical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants; whereas it cannot, I think, be disputed that the nature of the other inhabitants, with which each has to compete, is at least as important, and generally a far more important element of success. Now if we look to those inhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago which are found in other parts of the world (laying on one side for the moment the endemic species, which cannot be here fairly included, as we are considering how they have come to be modified since their arrival), we find a considerable amount of difference in the several islands. This difference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means of transport—a seed, for instance, of one plant having been brought to one island, and that of another plant to another island. Hence when in former times an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands, or when it subsequently spread from one island to another, it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions of life in the different islands, for it would have to compete with different sets of organisms: a plant, for instance, would find the best-fitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinct plants in one island than in another, and it would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies. If then it varied, natural selection would probably favour different varieties in the different islands. Some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same character throughout the group, just as we see on continents some species spreading widely and remaining the same.

The really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago, and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances, is that the new species formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other islands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are separated by deep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British Channel, and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been continuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the archipelago, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear to be on a map. Nevertheless a good many species, both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago, are common to the several islands, and we may infer from certain facts that these have probably spread from some one island to the others. But we often take, I think, an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species invading each other's territory, when put into free intercommunication. Undoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another, it will in a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it; but if both are equally well fitted for their own places in nature, both probably will hold their own places and keep separate for almost any length of time. Being familiar with the fact that many species, naturalised through man's agency, have spread with astonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer that most species would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms which become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species, belonging in a large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct genera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so well adapted for flying from island to island, are distinct on each; thus there are three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to its own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of Chatham Island to be blown to Charles Island, which has its own mocking-thrush: why should it succeed in establishing itself there? We may safely infer that Charles Island is well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the mocking-thrush peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr. Wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject; namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo possess many distinct but representative land-shells, some of which live in crevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually transported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island has not become colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless both islands have been colonised by some European land-shells, which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species. From these considerations I think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species, which inhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, not having universally spread from island to island. In many other instances, as in the several districts of the same continent, pre-occupation has probably played an important part in checking the commingling of species under the same conditions of life. Thus, the south-east and south-west corners of Australia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are united by continuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals, birds, and plants.

The principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora of oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not identically the same, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence colonists could most readily have been derived,—the colonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their new homes,—is of the widest application throughout nature. We see this on every mountain, in every lake and marsh. For Alpine species, excepting in so far as the same forms, chiefly of plants, have spread widely throughout the world during the recent Glacial epoch, are related to those of the surrounding lowlands;—thus we have in South America, Alpine humming-birds, Alpine rodents, Alpine plants, etc., all of strictly American forms, and it is obvious that a mountain, as it became slowly upheaved, would naturally be colonised from the surrounding lowlands. So it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes, excepting in so far as great facility of transport has given the same general forms to the whole world. We see this same principle in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of America and of Europe. Other analogous facts could be given. And it will, I believe, be universally found to be true, that wherever in two regions, let them be ever so distant, many closely allied or representative species occur, there will likewise be found some identical species, showing, in accordance with the foregoing view, that at some former period there has been intercommunication or migration between the two regions. And wherever many closely-allied species occur, there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct species, and some as varieties; these doubtful forms showing us the steps in the process of modification.

This relation between the power and extent of migration of a species, either at the present time or at some former period under different physical conditions, and the existence at remote points of the world of other species allied to it, is shown in another and more general way. Mr. Gould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which range over the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. I can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true, though it would be difficult to prove it. Amongst mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in Bats, and in a lesser degree in the Felidae and Canidae. We see it, if we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles. So it is with most fresh-water productions, in which so many genera range over the world, and many individual species have enormous ranges. It is not meant that in world-ranging genera all the species have a wide range, or even that they have on an average a wide range; but only that some of the species range very widely; for the facility with which widely-ranging species vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their average range. For instance, two varieties of the same species inhabit America and Europe, and the species thus has an immense range; but, if the variation had been a little greater, the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct species, and the common range would have been greatly reduced. Still less is it meant, that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged birds, will necessarily range widely; for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more important power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates. But on the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a single parent, though now distributed to the most remote points of the world, we ought to find, and I believe as a general rule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely; for it is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely, undergoing modification during its diffusion, and should place itself under diverse conditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring, firstly into new varieties and ultimately into new species.

In considering the wide distribution of certain genera, we should bear in mind that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched off from a common parent at a remote epoch; so that in such cases there will have been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of transport; and consequently for the migration of some of the species into all quarters of the world, where they may have become slightly modified in relation to their new conditions. There is, also, some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great class, generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms; and consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific character. This fact, together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and better fitted for distant transportation, probably accounts for a law which has long been observed, and which has lately been admirably discussed by Alph. de Candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of organisms is, the more widely it is apt to range.

The relations just discussed,—namely, low and slowly-changing organisms ranging more widely than the high,—some of the species of widely-ranging genera themselves ranging widely,—such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and marsh productions being related (with the exceptions before specified) to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands, though these stations are so different—the very close relation of the distinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelago,—and especially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of the nearest mainland,—are, I think, utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each species, but are explicable on the view of colonisation from the nearest and readiest source, together with the subsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes.




Summary of last and present Chapters.—In these chapters I have endeavoured to show, that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes of climate and of the level of the land, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other similar changes which may have occurred within the same period; if we remember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and curious means of occasional transport,—a subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised on; if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts, I think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals of the same species, wherever located, have descended from the same parents, are not insuperable. And we are led to this conclusion, which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation, by some general considerations, more especially from the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of sub-genera, genera, and families.

With respect to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my theory must have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same allowances as before for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of life change most slowly, enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration, I do not think that the difficulties are insuperable; though they often are in this case, and in that of the individuals of the same species, extremely grave.

As exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, I have attempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern Glacial period, which I am fully convinced simultaneously affected the whole world, or at least great meridional belts. As showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport, I have discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions.

If the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course of time the individuals of the same species, and likewise of allied species, have proceeded from some one source; then I think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus understand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus understand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it is that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the inhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and deserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent. Bearing in mind that the mutual relations of organism to organism are of the highest importance, we can see why two areas having nearly the same physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms of life; for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new inhabitants entered one region; according to the nature of the communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either in greater or lesser numbers; according or not, as those which entered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and with the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in different regions, independently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified conditions of life,—there would be an almost endless amount of organic action and reaction,—and we should find, as we do find, some groups of beings greatly, and some only slightly modified,—some developed in great force, some existing in scanty numbers—in the different great geographical provinces of the world.

On these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show, why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the means of migration, one group of beings, even within the same class, should have all its species endemic, and another group should have all its species common to other quarters of the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms, as batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic islands, whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar species of a.rial mammals or bats. We can see why there should be some relation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified condition, and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland. We can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely related to each other, and likewise be related, but less closely, to those of the nearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived. We can see why in two areas, however distant from each other, there should be a correlation, in the presence of identical species, of varieties, of doubtful species, and of distinct but representative species.

As the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those governing at the present time the differences in different areas. We see this in many facts. The endurance of each species and group of species is continuous in time; for the exceptions to the rule are so few, that they may fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent, but which occur above and below: so in space, it certainly is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species, or by a group of species, is continuous; and the exceptions, which are not rare, may, as I have attempted to show, be accounted for by migration at some former period under different conditions or by occasional means of transport, and by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. Both in time and space, species and groups of species have their points of maximum development. Groups of species, belonging either to a certain period of time, or to a certain area, are often characterised by trifling characters in common, as of sculpture or colour. In looking to the long succession of ages, as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find that some organisms differ little, whilst others belonging to a different class, or to a different order, or even only to a different family of the same order, differ greatly. In both time and space the lower members of each class generally change less than the higher; but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule. On my theory these several relations throughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we look to the forms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same quarter of the world, or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters, in both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the same bond of ordinary generation; and the more nearly any two forms are related in blood, the nearer they will generally stand to each other in time and space; in both cases the laws of variation have been the same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of natural selection.





CHAPTER XIII　MUTUAL AFFINITIES OF ORGANIC BEINGS: MORPHOLOGY: EMBRYOLOGY: RUDIMENTARY ORGANS


Classification, groups subordinate to groups—Natural system—Rules and difficulties in classification, explained on the theory of descent with modification—Classification of varieties—Descent always used in classification—Analogical or adaptive characters—Affinities, general, complex and radiating—Extinction separates and defines groups—Morphology, between members of the same class, between parts of the same individual—Embryology, laws of, explained by variations not supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding age—Rudimentary organs; their origin explained—Summary

From the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups. This classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations. The existence of groups would have been of simple signification, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable matter, and so on; but the case is widely different in nature; for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same sub-group have different habits. In our second and fourth chapters, on Variation and on Natural Selection, I have attempted to show that it is the widely ranging, the much diffused and common, that is the dominant species belonging to the larger genera, which vary most. The varieties, or incipient species, thus produced ultimately become converted, as I believe, into new and distinct species; and these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to produce other new and dominant species. Consequently the groups which are now large, and which generally include many dominant species, tend to go on increasing indefinitely in size. I further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature, there is a constant tendency in their characters to diverge. This conclusion was supported by looking at the great diversity of the forms of life which, in any small area, come into the closest competition, and by looking to certain facts in naturalisation.

I attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant and exterminate the less divergent, the less improved, and preceding forms. I request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as formerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that the inevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. In the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species; and all the genera on this line form together one class, for all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent, and, consequently, have inherited something in common. But the three genera on the left hand have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a sub-family, distinct from that including the next two genera on the right hand, which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent. These five genera have also much, though less, in common; and they form a family distinct from that including the three genera still further to the right hand, which diverged at a still earlier period. And all these genera, descended from (A), form an order distinct from the genera descended from (I). So that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera; and the genera are included in, or subordinate to, sub-families, families, and orders, all united into one class. Thus, the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group, which, from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment fully explained.

Naturalists try to arrange the species, genera, and families in each class, on what is called the Natural System. But what is meant by this system? Some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike, and for separating those which are most unlike; or as an artificial means for enunciating, as briefly as possible, general propositions,—that is, by one sentence to give the characters common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to all carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then by adding a single sentence, a full description is given of each kind of dog. The ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable. But many naturalists think that something more is meant by the Natural System; they believe that it reveals the plan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether order in time or space, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator, it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Such expressions as that famous one of Linnaeus, and which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form, that the characters do not make the genus, but that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that something more is included in our classification, than mere resemblance. I believe that something more is included; and that propinquity of descent,—the only known cause of the similarity of organic beings,—is the bond, hidden as it is by various degrees of modification, which is partially revealed to us by our classifications.

Let us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either gives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most like each other. It might have been thought (and was in ancient times thought) that those parts of the structure which determined the habits of life, and the general place of each being in the economy of nature, would be of very high importance in classification. Nothing can be more false. No one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a whale to a fish, as of any importance. These resemblances, though so intimately connected with the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely “adaptive or analogical characters;” but to the consideration of these resemblances we shall have to recur. It may even be given as a general rule, that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special habits, the more important it becomes for classification. As an instance: Owen, in speaking of the dugong, says, “The generative organs being those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities. We are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential character.” So with plants, how remarkable it is that the organs of vegetation, on which their whole life depends, are of little signification, excepting in the first main divisions; whereas the organs of reproduction, with their product the seed, are of paramount importance!

We must not, therefore, in classifying, trust to resemblances in parts of the organisation, however important they may be for the welfare of the being in relation to the outer world. Perhaps from this cause it has partly arisen, that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on resemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance. No doubt this view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is generally, but by no means always, true. But their importance for classification, I believe, depends on their greater constancy throughout large groups of species; and this constancy depends on such organs having generally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to their conditions of life. That the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its classificatory value, is almost shown by the one fact, that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have every reason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its classificatory value is widely different. No naturalist can have worked at any group without being struck with this fact; and it has been most fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author. It will suffice to quote the highest authority, Robert Brown, who in speaking of certain organs in the Proteaceae, says their generic importance, “like that of all their parts, not only in this but, as I apprehend, in every natural family, is very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost.” Again in another work he says, the genera of the Connaraceae “differ in having one or more ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or valvular aestivation. Any one of these characters singly is frequently of more than generic importance, though here even when all taken together they appear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus.” To give an example amongst insects, in one great division of the Hymenoptera, the antennae, as Westwood has remarked, are most constant in structure; in another division they differ much, and the differences are of quite subordinate value in classification; yet no one probably will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological importance. Any number of instances could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same important organ within the same group of beings.

Again, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high physiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this condition are often of high value in classification. No one will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants, and certain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms. Robert Brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the highest importance in the classification of the Grasses.

Numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole groups. For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles—the inflection of the angle of the jaws in Marsupials—the manner in which the wings of insects are folded—mere colour in certain Algae—mere pubescence on parts of the flower in grasses—the nature of the dermal covering, as hair or feathers, in the Vertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair, this external and trifling character would, I think, have been considered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to birds and reptiles, as an approach in structure in any one internal and important organ.

The importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly depends on their being correlated with several other characters of more or less importance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident in natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked, a species may depart from its allies in several characters, both of high physiological importance and of almost universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked. Hence, also, it has been found, that a classification founded on any single character, however important that may be, has always failed; for no part of the organisation is universally constant. The importance of an aggregate of characters, even when none are important, alone explains, I think, that saying of Linnaeus, that the characters do not give the genus, but the genus gives the characters; for this saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance, too slight to be defined. Certain plants, belonging to the Malpighiaceae, bear perfect and degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de Jussieu has remarked, “the greater number of the characters proper to the species, to the genus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus laugh at our classification.” But when Aspicarpa produced in France, during several years, only degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this genus should still be retained amongst the Malpighiaceae. This case seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes necessarily founded.

Practically when naturalists are at work, they do not trouble themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use in defining a group, or in allocating any particular species. If they find a character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and not common to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to some lesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. This principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire. If certain characters are always found correlated with others, though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set on them. As in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those for propelling the blood, or for aerating it, or those for propagating the race, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly serviceable in classification; but in some groups of animals all these, the most important vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite subordinate value.

We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult, for our classifications of course include all ages of each species. But it is by no means obvious, on the ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature. Yet it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that embryonic characters are the most important of any in the classification of animals; and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true. The same fact holds good with flowering plants, of which the two main divisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryo,—on the number and position of the embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle. In our discussion on embryology, we shall see why such characters are so valuable, on the view of classification tacitly including the idea of descent.

Our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities. Nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all birds; but in the case of crustaceans, such definition has hitherto been found impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series, which have hardly a character in common; yet the species at both ends, from being plainly allied to others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the Articulata.

Geographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite logically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of closely allied forms. Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of this practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by several entomologists and botanists.

Finally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of species, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and genera, they seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. Several of the best botanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted on their arbitrary value. Instances could be given amongst plants and insects, of a group of forms, first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus, and then raised to the rank of a sub-family or family; and this has been done, not because further research has detected important structural differences, at first overlooked, but because numerous allied species, with slightly different grades of difference, have been subsequently discovered.

All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and not some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general propositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike.

But I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the arrangement of the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the other groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups, though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ greatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera, families, sections, or orders. The reader will best understand what is meant, if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the fourth chapter. We will suppose the letters A to L to represent allied genera, which lived during the Silurian epoch, and these have descended from a species which existed at an unknown anterior period. Species of three of these genera (A, F, and I) have transmitted modified descendants to the present day, represented by the fifteen genera (a14 to z14) on the uppermost horizontal line. Now all these modified descendants from a single species, are represented as related in blood or descent to the same degree; they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree; yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each other. The forms descended from A, now broken up into two or three families, constitute a distinct order from those descended from I, also broken up into two families. Nor can the existing species, descended from A, be ranked in the same genus with the parent A; or those from I, with the parent I. But the existing genus F14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified; and it will then rank with the parent-genus F; just as some few still living organic beings belong to Silurian genera. So that the amount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to each other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely different. Nevertheless their genealogical arrangement remains strictly true, not only at the present time, but at each successive period of descent. All the modified descendants from A will have inherited something in common from their common parent, as will all the descendants from I; so will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants, at each successive period. If, however, we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of A or of I have been so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of their parentage, in this case, their places in a natural classification will have been more or less completely lost,—as sometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms. All the descendants of the genus F, along its whole line of descent, are supposed to have been but little modified, and they yet form a single genus. But this genus, though much isolated, will still occupy its proper intermediate position; for F originally was intermediate in character between A and I, and the several genera descended from these two genera will have inherited to a certain extent their characters. This natural arrangement is shown, as far as is possible on paper, in the diagram, but in much too simple a manner. If a branching diagram had not been used, and only the names of the groups had been written in a linear series, it would have been still less possible to have given a natural arrangement; and it is notoriously not possible to represent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we discover in nature amongst the beings of the same group. Thus, on the view which I hold, the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a pedigree; but the degrees of modification which the different groups have undergone, have to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called genera, sub-families, families, sections, orders, and classes.

It may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking the case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world; and if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, I think, be the only possible one. Yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little, and had given rise to few new languages, whilst others (owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races, descended from a common race) had altered much, and had given rise to many new languages and dialects. The various degrees of difference in the languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly natural, as it would connect together all languages, extinct and modern, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue.

In confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of varieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one species. These are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under varieties; and with our domestic productions, several other grades of difference are requisite, as we have seen with pigeons. The origin of the existence of groups subordinate to groups, is the same with varieties as with species, namely, closeness of descent with various degrees of modification. Nearly the same rules are followed in classifying varieties, as with species. Authors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to class two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts the swedish and common turnips together, though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used in classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body, etc.; whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing varieties, I apprehend if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical classification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted by some authors. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or less modification, the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points. In tumbler pigeons, though some sub-varieties differ from the others in the important character of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning or thinking on the subject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood and alike in some other respects. If it could be proved that the Hottentot had descended from the Negro, I think he would be classed under the Negro group, however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes.

With species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought descent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade, or that of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes differ in the most important characters, is known to every naturalist: scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no one dreams of separating them. The naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the same individual, however much they may differ from each other and from the adult; as he likewise includes the so-called alternate generations of Steenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same individual. He includes monsters; he includes varieties, not solely because they closely resemble the parent-form, but because they are descended from it. He who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose, or conversely, ranks them together as a single species, and gives a single definition. As soon as three Orchidean forms (Monochanthus, Myanthus, and Catasetum), which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were known to be sometimes produced on the same spike, they were immediately included as a single species. But it may be asked, what ought we to do, if it could be proved that one species of kangaroo had been produced, by a long course of modification, from a bear? Ought we to rank this one species with bears, and what should we do with the other species? The supposition is of course preposterous; and I might answer by the argumentum ad hominem, and ask what should be done if a perfect kangaroo were seen to come out of the womb of a bear? According to all analogy, it would be ranked with bears; but then assuredly all the other species of the kangaroo family would have to be classed under the bear genus. The whole case is preposterous; for where there has been close descent in common, there will certainly be close resemblance or affinity.

As descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals of the same species, though the males and females and larvae are sometimes extremely different; and as it has been used in classing varieties which have undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount of modification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups, though in these cases the modification has been greater in degree, and has taken a longer time to complete? I believe it has thus been unconsciously used; and only thus can I understand the several rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists. We have no written pedigrees; we have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind. Therefore we choose those characters which, as far as we can judge, are the least likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed. Rudimentary structures on this view are as good as, or even sometimes better than, other parts of the organisation. We care not how trifling a character may be—let it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect's wing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers—if it prevail throughout many and different species, especially those having very different habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its inheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure, but when several characters, let them be ever so trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings having different habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor. And we know that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in classification.

We can understand why a species or a group of species may depart, in several of its most important characteristics, from its allies, and yet be safely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often done, as long as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so unimportant, betrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two forms have not a single character in common, yet if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at once infer their community of descent, and we put them all into the same class. As we find organs of high physiological importance—those which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of existence—are generally the most constant, we attach especial value to them; but if these same organs, in another group or section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once value them less in our classification. We shall hereafter, I think, clearly see why embryological characters are of such high classificatory importance. Geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large and widely-distributed genera, because all the species of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region, have in all probability descended from the same parents.

We can understand, on these views, the very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. Lamarck first called attention to this distinction, and he has been ably followed by Macleay and others. The resemblance, in the shape of the body and in the fin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a pachydermatous animal, and the whale, and between both these mammals and fishes, is analogical. Amongst insects there are innumerable instances: thus Linnaeus, misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth. We see something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties, as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip. The resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct animals. On my view of characters being of real importance for classification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character, although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the systematist. For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent, may readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus assume a close external resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal—will rather tend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of descent. We can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water; but the shape of the body and fin-like limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so many characters, great and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor. So it is with fishes.

As members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances,—to inhabit for instance the three elements of land, air, and water,—we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the sub-groups in distinct classes. A naturalist, struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary, quaternary, and ternary classifications have probably arisen.

As the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger genera, tend to inherit the advantages, which made the groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to spread widely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature. The larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size; and they consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups. Thus we can account for the fact that all organisms, recent and extinct, are included under a few great orders, under still fewer classes, and all in one great natural system. As showing how few the higher groups are in number, and how widely spread they are throughout the world, the fact is striking, that the discovery of Australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order; and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it has added only two or three orders of small size.

In the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the principle of each group having generally diverged much in character during the long-continued process of modification, how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate between existing groups. A few old and intermediate parent-forms having occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified, will give to us our so-called osculant or aberrant groups. The more aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost. And we have some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from extinction, for they are generally represented by extremely few species; and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other, which again implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, for example, would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by a single one; but such richness in species, as I find after some investigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera. We can, I think, account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors, with a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable circumstances.

Mr. Waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity in most cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr. Waterhouse, of all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to Marsupials; but in the points in which it approaches this order, its relations are general, and not to any one marsupial species more than to another. As the points of affinity of the bizcacha to Marsupials are believed to be real and not merely adaptive, they are due on my theory to inheritance in common. Therefore we must suppose either that all Rodents, including the bizcacha, branched off from some very ancient Marsupial, which will have had a character in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing Marsupials; or that both Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a common progenitor, and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions. On either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will not be specially related to any one existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or nearly all Marsupials, from having partially retained the character of their common progenitor, or of an early member of the group. On the other hand, of all Marsupials, as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the phascolomys resembles most nearly, not any one species, but the general order of Rodents. In this case, however, it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only analogical, owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made nearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders of plants.

On the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character of the species descended from a common parent, together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group are connected together. For the common parent of a whole family of species, now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted some of its characters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all; and the several species will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often referred to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is difficult to show the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred of any ancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and almost impossible to do this without this aid, we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing, without the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same great natural class.

Extinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an important part in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in each class. We may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes from each other—for instance, of birds from all other vertebrate animals—by the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes. There has been less entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with batrachians. There has been still less in some other classes, as in that of the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long, but broken, chain of affinities. Extinction has only separated groups: it has by no means made them; for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished from other groups, as all would blend together by steps as fine as those between the finest existing varieties, nevertheless a natural classification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible. We shall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may represent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced large groups of modified descendants. Every intermediate link between these eleven genera and their primordial parent, and every intermediate link in each branch and sub-branch of their descendants, may be supposed to be still alive; and the links to be as fine as those between the finest varieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition by which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished from their more immediate parents; or these parents from their ancient and unknown progenitor. Yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still hold good; and, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended from A, or from I, would have something in common. In a tree we can specify this or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together. We could not, as I have said, define the several groups; but we could pick out types, or forms, representing most of the characters of each group, whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences between them. This is what we should be driven to, if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have lived throughout all time and space. We shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are tending in this direction; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an able paper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we can separate and define the groups to which such types belong.

Finally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from the struggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces extinction and divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant parent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the affinities of all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group under group. We use the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of all ages, although having few characters in common, under one species; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties, however different they may be from their parent; and I believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the Natural System. On this idea of the natural system being, in so far as it has been perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with the grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent, expressed by the terms genera, families, orders, etc., we can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our classification. We can understand why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we are permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling physiological importance; why, in comparing one group with a distinct group, we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use these same characters within the limits of the same group. We can clearly see how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in one great system; and how the several members of each class are connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities. We shall never, probably, disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the members of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and do not look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but slow progress.




Morphology.—We have seen that the members of the same class, independently of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term “unity of type;” or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is included under the general name of Morphology. This is the most interesting department of natural history, and may be said to be its very soul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions? Geoffroy St. Hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relative connexion in homologous organs: the parts may change to almost any extent in form and size, and yet they always remain connected together in the same order. We never find, for instance, the bones of the arm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the same names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals. We see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of a beetle?—yet all these organs, serving for such different purposes, are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and two pairs of maxillae. Analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the flowers of plants.

Nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of pattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine of final causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted by Owen in his most interesting work on the “Nature of Limbs.” On the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can only say that so it is;—that it has so pleased the Creator to construct each animal and plant.

The explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight modifications,—each modification being profitable in some way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation of growth other parts of the organisation. In changes of this nature, there will be little or no tendency to modify the original pattern, or to transpose parts. The bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent, and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin; or a webbed foot might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to any extent, and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent, so as to serve as a wing: yet in all this great amount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of the several parts. If we suppose that the ancient progenitor, the archetype as it may be called, of all mammals, had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we can at once perceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the whole class. So with the mouths of insects, we have only to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles, and two pair of maxillae, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and then natural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths of insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by the soldering together of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of others,—variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility. In the paddles of the extinct gigantic sea-lizards, and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans, the general pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured.

There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with—that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with—the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike.

How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern?

On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions. In the vertebrata, we see a series of internal vertebrae bearing certain processes and appendages; in the articulata, we see the body divided into a series of segments, bearing external appendages; and in flowering plants, we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves. An indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic (as Owen has observed) of all low or little-modified forms; therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebrae; the unknown progenitor of the articulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many spiral whorls of leaves. We have formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure; consequently it is quite probable that natural selection, during a long-continued course of modification, should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar elements, many times repeated, and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes. And as the whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight successive steps, we need not wonder at discovering in such parts or organs, a certain degree of fundamental resemblance, retained by the strong principle of inheritance.

In the great class of molluscs, though we can homologise the parts of one species with those of another and distinct species, we can indicate but few serial homologies; that is, we are seldom enabled to say that one part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual. And we can understand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of the class, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part, as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.

Naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed vertebrae: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in these cases probably be more correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of both skull and vertebrae, both jaws and legs, etc.,—as having been metamorphosed, not one from the other, but from some common element. Naturalists, however, use such language only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind—vertebrae in the one case and legs in the other—have actually been modified into skulls or jaws. Yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred, that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification. On my view these terms may be used literally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab retaining numerous characters, which they would probably have retained through inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent from true legs, or from some simple appendage, is explained.




Embryology.—It has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the individual, which when mature become widely different and serve for different purposes, are in the embryo exactly alike. The embryos, also, of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar: a better proof of this cannot be given, than a circumstance mentioned by Agassiz, namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some vertebrate animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal, bird, or reptile. The vermiform larvae of moths, flies, beetles, etc., resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects; but in the case of larvae, the embryos are active, and have been adapted for special lines of life. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance, sometimes lasts till a rather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of closely allied genera, often resemble each other in their first and second plumage; as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most of the species are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion. We occasionally though rarely see something of this kind in plants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze, and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas, are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosae.

The points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different animals of the same class resemble each other, often have no direct relation to their conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance, suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar conditions,—in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother, in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water. We have no more reason to believe in such a relation, than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise, are related to similar conditions of life. No one will suppose that the stripes on the whelp of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, are of any use to these animals, or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed.

The case, however, is different when an animal during any part of its embryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself. The period of activity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes on, the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal. From such special adaptations, the similarity of the larvae or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes much obscured; and cases could be given of the larvae of two species, or of two groups of species, differing quite as much, or even more, from each other than do their adult parents. In most cases, however, the larvae, though active, still obey more or less closely the law of common embryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the illustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly is, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the pedunculated and sessile, which differ widely in external appearance, have larvae in all their several stages barely distinguishable.

The embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation: I use this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower. But no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. In some cases, however, the mature animal is generally considered as lower in the scale than the larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. To refer once again to cirripedes: the larvae in the first stage have three pairs of legs, a very simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they feed largely, for they increase much in size. In the second stage, answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes, and extremely complex antennae; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth, and cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search by their well-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers of swimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for life: their legs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a well-constructed mouth; but they have no antennae, and their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute, single, and very simple eye-spot. In this last and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition. But in some genera the larvae become developed either into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called complemental males: and in the latter, the development has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time, and is destitute of mouth, stomach, or other organ of importance, excepting for reproduction.

We are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the embryo and the adult, and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of widely different animals within the same class, that we might be led to look at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth. But there is no obvious reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all the parts in proper proportion, as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo. And in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups, the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the adult: thus Owen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, “there is no metamorphosis; the cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed;” and again in spiders, “there is nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis.” The larvae of insects, whether adapted to the most diverse and active habits, or quite inactive, being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of proper nutriment, yet nearly all pass through a similar worm-like stage of development; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis, if we look to the admirable drawings by Professor Huxley of the development of this insect, we see no trace of the vermiform stage.

How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,—namely the very general, but not universal difference in structure between the embryo and the adult;—of parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being at this early period of growth alike;—of embryos of different species within the same class, generally, but not universally, resembling each other;—of the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence, except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for itself;—of the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal, into which it is developed. I believe that all these facts can be explained, as follows, on the view of descent with modification.

It is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the embryo at a very early period, that slight variations necessarily appear at an equally early period. But we have little evidence on this head—indeed the evidence rather points the other way; for it is notorious that breeders of cattle, horses, and various fancy animals, cannot positively tell, until some time after the animal has been born, what its merits or form will ultimately turn out. We see this plainly in our own children; we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short, or what its precise features will be. The question is not, at what period of life any variation has been caused, but at what period it is fully displayed. The cause may have acted, and I believe generally has acted, even before the embryo is formed; and the variation may be due to the male and female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which either parent, or their ancestors, have been exposed. Nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period, even before the formation of the embryo, may appear late in life; as when an hereditary disease, which appears in old age alone, has been communicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of one parent. Or again, as when the horns of cross-bred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either parent. For the welfare of a very young animal, as long as it remains in its mother's womb, or in the egg, or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent, it must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would not signify, for instance, to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak, whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length, as long as it was fed by its parents. Hence, I conclude, that it is quite possible, that each of the many successive modifications, by which each species has acquired its present structure, may have supervened at a not very early period of life; and some direct evidence from our domestic animals supports this view. But in other cases it is quite possible that each successive modification, or most of them, may have appeared at an extremely early period.

I have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to render it probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring. Certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages, for instance, peculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth; or, again, in the horns of almost full-grown cattle. But further than this, variations which, for all that we can see, might have appeared earlier or later in life, tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent. I am far from meaning that this is invariably the case; and I could give a good many cases of variations (taking the word in the largest sense) which have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent.

These two principles, if their truth be admitted, will, I believe, explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology. But first let us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. Some authors who have written on Dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog, though appearing so different, are really varieties most closely allied, and have probably descended from the same wild stock; hence I was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other: I was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days old puppies, I found that the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional difference. So, again, I was told that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the full-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as I think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication; but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference.

As the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic breeds of Pigeon have descended from one wild species, I compared young pigeons of various breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; I carefully measured the proportions (but will not here give details) of the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now some of these birds, when mature, differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak, that they would, I cannot doubt, be ranked in distinct genera, had they been natural productions. But when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row, though most of them could be distinguished from each other, yet their proportional differences in the above specified several points were incomparably less than in the full-grown birds. Some characteristic points of difference—for instance, that of the width of mouth—could hardly be detected in the young. But there was one remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon and of the other breeds, in all its proportions, almost exactly as much as in the adult state.

The two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties. Fanciers select their horses, dogs, and pigeons, for breeding, when they are nearly grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have been acquired earlier or later in life, if the full-grown animal possesses them. And the cases just given, more especially that of pigeons, seem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each breed, and which have been accumulated by man's selection, have not generally first appeared at an early period of life, and have been inherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period. But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at the corresponding, but at an earlier age.

Now let us apply these facts and the above two principles—which latter, though not proved true, can be shown to be in some degree probable—to species in a state of nature. Let us take a genus of birds, descended on my theory from some one parent-species, and of which the several new species have become modified through natural selection in accordance with their diverse habits. Then, from the many slight successive steps of variation having supervened at a rather late age, and having been inherited at a corresponding age, the young of the new species of our supposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we have seen in the case of pigeons. We may extend this view to whole families or even classes. The fore-limbs, for instance, which served as legs in the parent-species, may become, by a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings; and on the above two principles—namely of each successive modification supervening at a rather late age, and being inherited at a corresponding late age—the fore-limbs in the embryos of the several descendants of the parent-species will still resemble each other closely, for they will not have been modified. But in each individual new species, the embryonic fore-limbs will differ greatly from the fore-limbs in the mature animal; the limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a rather late period of life, and having thus been converted into hands, or paddles, or wings. Whatever influence long-continued exercise or use on the one hand, and disuse on the other, may have in modifying an organ, such influence will mainly affect the mature animal, which has come to its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living; and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age. Whereas the young will remain unmodified, or be modified in a lesser degree, by the effects of use and disuse.

In certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene, from causes of which we are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life, or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it first appeared. In either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form. We have seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals, as with cuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the great class of insects, as with Aphis. With respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age, we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies; firstly, from the young, during a course of modification carried on for many generations, having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage of development, and secondly, from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents; for in this case, it would be indispensable for the existence of the species, that the child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with its parents, in accordance with their similar habits. Some further explanation, however, of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite. If, on the other hand, it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree different from those of their parent, and consequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, the active young or larvae might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their parents. Such differences might, also, become correlated with successive stages of development; so that the larvae, in the first stage, might differ greatly from the larvae in the second stage, as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes. The adult might become fitted for sites or habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be useless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde.

As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by the finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system. On this view we can understand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult. For the embryo is the animal in its less modified state; and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor. In two groups of animal, however much they may at present differ from each other in structure and habits, if they pass through the same or similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or nearly similar parents, and are therefore in that degree closely related. Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent. It will reveal this community of descent, however much the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured; we have seen, for instance, that cirripedes can at once be recognised by their larvae as belonging to the great class of crustaceans. As the embryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified ancient progenitors, we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their descendants,—our existing species. Agassiz believes this to be a law of nature; but I am bound to confess that I only hope to see the law hereafter proved true. It can be proved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state, now supposed to be represented in many embryos, has not been obliterated, either by the successive variations in a long course of modification having supervened at a very early age, or by the variations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at which they first appeared. It should also be borne in mind, that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of recent forms, may be true, but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable of demonstration.

Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are second in importance to none in natural history, are explained on the principle of slight modifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of each, though perhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period. Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals.




Rudimentary, atrophied, or aborted organs.—Organs or parts in this strange condition, bearing the stamp of inutility, are extremely common throughout nature. For instance, rudimentary mammae are very general in the males of mammals: I presume that the “bastard-wing” in birds may be safely considered as a digit in a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is rudimentary; in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hind limbs. Some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious; for instance, the presence of teeth in foetal whales, which when grown up have not a tooth in their heads; and the presence of teeth, which never cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of our unborn calves. It has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds. Nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight, yet in how many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight, and not rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered together!

The meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for instance there are beetles of the same genus (and even of the same species) resembling each other most closely in all respects, one of which will have full-sized wings, and another mere rudiments of membrane; and here it is impossible to doubt, that the rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality, and are merely not developed: this seems to be the case with the mammae of male mammals, for many instances are on record of these organs having become well developed in full-grown males, and having secreted milk. So again there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus Bos, but in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk. In individual plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments, and sometimes in a well-developed state. In plants with separated sexes, the male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil; and K.lreuter found that by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species, the rudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size; and this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in nature.

An organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one, even the more important purpose; and remain perfectly efficient for the other. Thus in plants, the office of the pistil is to allow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its base. The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some Compositae, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have a pistil, which is in a rudimentary state, for it is not crowned with a stigma; but the style remains well developed, and is clothed with hairs as in other compositae, for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the surrounding anthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose, and be used for a distinct object: in certain fish the swim-bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy, but has become converted into a nascent breathing organ or lung. Other similar instances could be given.

Rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable to vary in degree of development and in other respects. Moreover, in closely allied species, the degree to which the same organ has been rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain groups. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies, that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ, which analogy would lead us to expect to find, and which is occasionally found in monstrous individuals of the species. Thus in the snapdragon (antirrhinum) we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen; but this may sometimes be seen. In tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of a class, nothing is more common, or more necessary, than the use and discovery of rudiments. This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of the bones of the leg of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.

It is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo, but afterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a universal rule, that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining parts in the embryo, than in the adult; so that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in any degree rudimentary. Hence, also, a rudimentary organ in the adult, is often said to have retained its embryonic condition.

I have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs. In reflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment: for the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs, are imperfect and useless. In works on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created “for the sake of symmetry,” or in order “to complete the scheme of nature;” but this seems to me no explanation, merely a restatement of the fact. Would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun, satellites follow the same course round the planets, for the sake of symmetry, and to complete the scheme of nature? An eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can we suppose that the minute papilla, which often represents the pistil in male flowers, and which is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus act? Can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are subsequently absorbed, can be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime? When a man's fingers have been amputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps: I could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have appeared, not from unknown laws of growth, but in order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose.

On my view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary organs is simple. We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic productions,—as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds,—the vestige of an ear in earless breeds,—the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in young animals,—and the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. We often see rudiments of various parts in monsters. But I doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for I doubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes. I believe that disuse has been the main agency; that it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction of various organs, until they have become rudimentary,—as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying. Again, an organ useful under certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands; and in this case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.

Any change in function, which can be effected by insensibly small steps, is within the power of natural selection; so that an organ rendered, during changed habits of life, useless or injurious for one purpose, might easily be modified and used for another purpose. Or an organ might be retained for one alone of its former functions. An organ, when rendered useless, may well be variable, for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection. At whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ, and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age, and consequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo. Thus we can understand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo, and their lesser relative size in the adult. But if each step of the process of reduction were to be inherited, not at the corresponding age, but at an extremely early period of life (as we have good reason to believe to be possible) the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost, and we should have a case of complete abortion. The principle, also, of economy, explained in a former chapter, by which the materials forming any part or structure, if not useful to the possessor, will be saved as far as is possible, will probably often come into play; and this will tend to cause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ.

As the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every part of the organisation, which has long existed, to be inherited—we can understand, on the genealogical view of classification, how it is that systematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high physiological importance. Rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the spelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a clue in seeking for its derivation. On the view of descent with modification, we may conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite aborted, far from presenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated, and can be accounted for by the laws of inheritance.




Summary.—In this chapter I have attempted to show, that the subordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time; that the nature of the relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications; the value set upon characters, if constant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the most trifling importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no importance; the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters, and characters of true affinity; and other such rules;—all naturally follow on the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by naturalists as allied, together with their modification through natural selection, with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. In considering this view of classification, it should be borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking together the sexes, ages, and acknowledged varieties of the same species, however different they may be in structure. If we extend the use of this element of descent,—the only certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings,—we shall understand what is meant by the natural system: it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties, species, genera, families, orders, and classes.

On this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts in Morphology become intelligible,—whether we look to the same pattern displayed in the homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, of the different species of a class; or to the homologous parts constructed on the same pattern in each individual animal and plant.

On the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of life, and being inherited at a corresponding period, we can understand the great leading facts in Embryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual embryo of the homologous parts, which when matured will become widely different from each other in structure and function; and the resemblance in different species of a class of the homologous parts or organs, though fitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible. Larvae are active embryos, which have become specially modified in relation to their habits of life, through the principle of modifications being inherited at corresponding ages. On this same principle—and bearing in mind, that when organs are reduced in size, either from disuse or selection, it will generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of inheritance—the occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion, present to us no inexplicable difficulties; on the contrary, their presence might have been even anticipated. The importance of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on the view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical.

Finally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in this chapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable species, genera, and families of organic beings, with which this world is peopled, have all descended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and have all been modified in the course of descent, that I should without hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other facts or arguments.





CHAPTER XIV　RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION


Recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of Natural Selection—Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour—Causes of the general belief in the immutability of species—How far the theory of natural selection may be extended—Effects of its adoption on the study of Natural history—Concluding remarks

As this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.

That many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory of descent with modification through natural selection, I do not deny. I have endeavoured to give to them their full force. Nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been perfected, not by means superior to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual possessor. Nevertheless, this difficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions, namely,—that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct, which we may consider, either do now exist or could have existed, each good of its kind,—that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight a degree, variable,—and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct. The truth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed.

It is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations many structures have been perfected, more especially amongst broken and failing groups of organic beings; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, as is proclaimed by the canon, “Natura non facit saltum,” that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or any whole being, could not have arrived at its present state by many graduated steps. There are, it must be admitted, cases of special difficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the most curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile females in the same community of ants; but I have attempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered.

With respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter, which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together, but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species. We see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the result, when the same two species are crossed reciprocally; that is, when one species is first used as the father and then as the mother.

The fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring cannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general fertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely that either their constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly modified. Moreover, most of the varieties which have been experimentised on have been produced under domestication; and as domestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility, we ought not to expect it also to produce sterility.

The sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first crosses, for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally impotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a perfect condition. As we continually see that organisms of all kinds are rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been disturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life, we need not feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their constitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded of two distinct organisations. This parallelism is supported by another parallel, but directly opposite, class of facts; namely, that the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in their conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly modified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility. So that, on the one hand, considerable changes in the conditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms, lessen fertility; and on the other hand, lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less modified forms, increase fertility.

Turning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with modification are grave enough. All the individuals of the same species, and all the species of the same genus, or even higher group, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, in however distant and isolated parts of the world they are now found, they must in the course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the others. We are often wholly unable even to conjecture how this could have been effected. Yet, as we have reason to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for very long periods, enormously long as measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same species; for during very long periods of time there will always be a good chance for wide migration by many means. A broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the intermediate regions. It cannot be denied that we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern periods; and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated migration. As an example, I have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of the Glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of representative species throughout the world. We are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transport. With respect to distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration will have been possible during a very long period; and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same genus is in some degree lessened.

As on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of intermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species in each group by gradations as fine as our present varieties, it may be asked, Why do we not see these linking forms all around us? Why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? With respect to existing forms, we should remember that we have no right to expect (excepting in rare cases) to discover directly connecting links between them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form. Even on a wide area, which has during a long period remained continuous, and of which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in going from a district occupied by one species into another district occupied by a closely allied species, we have no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone. For we have reason to believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period; and all changes are slowly effected. I have also shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the intermediate zones, will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on either hand; and the latter, from existing in greater numbers, will generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate varieties, which exist in lesser numbers; so that the intermediate varieties will, in the long run, be supplanted and exterminated.

On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links, between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species, why is not every geological formation charged with such links? Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life? We meet with no such evidence, and this is the most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urged against my theory. Why, again, do whole groups of allied species appear, though certainly they often falsely appear, to have come in suddenly on the several geological stages? Why do we not find great piles of strata beneath the Silurian system, stored with the remains of the progenitors of the Silurian groups of fossils? For certainly on my theory such strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in the world's history.

I can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe. It cannot be objected that there has not been time sufficient for any amount of organic change; for the lapse of time has been so great as to be utterly inappreciable by the human intellect. The number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species which certainly have existed. We should not be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or more species if we were to examine them ever so closely, unless we likewise possessed many of the intermediate links between their past or parent and present states; and these many links we could hardly ever expect to discover, owing to the imperfection of the geological record. Numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably varieties; but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered, that naturalists will be able to decide, on the common view, whether or not these doubtful forms are varieties? As long as most of the links between any two species are unknown, if any one link or intermediate variety be discovered, it will simply be classed as another and distinct species. Only a small portion of the world has been geologically explored. Only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least in any great number. Widely ranging species vary most, and varieties are often at first local,—both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links less likely. Local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and improved; and when they do spread, if discovered in a geological formation, they will appear as if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species. Most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation; and their duration, I am inclined to believe, has been shorter than the average duration of specific forms. Successive formations are separated from each other by enormous blank intervals of time; for fossiliferous formations, thick enough to resist future degradation, can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. During the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will be blank. During these latter periods there will probably be more variability in the forms of life; during periods of subsidence, more extinction.

With respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest Silurian strata, I can only recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth chapter. That the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that it is imperfect to the degree which I require, few will be inclined to admit. If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly declares that all species have changed; and they have changed in the manner which my theory requires, for they have changed slowly and in a graduated manner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to each other, than are the fossils from formations distant from each other in time.

Such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may justly be urged against my theory; and I have now briefly recapitulated the answers and explanations which can be given to them. I have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many years to doubt their weight. But it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how ignorant we are. We do not know all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied means of Distribution during the long lapse of years, or that we know how imperfect the Geological Record is. Grave as these several difficulties are, in my judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent with modification.




Now let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication we see much variability. This seems to be mainly due to the reproductive system being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; so that this system, when not rendered impotent, fails to reproduce offspring exactly like the parent-form. Variability is governed by many complex laws,—by correlation of growth, by use and disuse, and by the direct action of the physical conditions of life. There is much difficulty in ascertaining how much modification our domestic productions have undergone; but we may safely infer that the amount has been large, and that modifications can be inherited for long periods. As long as the conditions of life remain the same, we have reason to believe that a modification, which has already been inherited for many generations, may continue to be inherited for an almost infinite number of generations. On the other hand we have evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does not wholly cease; for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our most anciently domesticated productions.

Man does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally exposes organic beings to new conditions of life, and then nature acts on the organisation, and causes variability. But man can and does select the variations given to him by nature, and thus accumulate them in any desired manner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure. He may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful to him at the time, without any thought of altering the breed. It is certain that he can largely influence the character of a breed by selecting, in each successive generation, individual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an uneducated eye. This process of selection has been the great agency in the production of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds. That many of the breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural species, is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species.

There is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. In the preservation of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see the most powerful and ever-acting means of selection. The struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings. This high rate of increase is proved by calculation, by the effects of a succession of peculiar seasons, and by the results of naturalisation, as explained in the third chapter. More individuals are born than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die,—which variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become extinct. As the individuals of the same species come in all respects into the closest competition with each other, the struggle will generally be most severe between them; it will be almost equally severe between the varieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species of the same genus. But the struggle will often be very severe between beings most remote in the scale of nature. The slightest advantage in one being, at any age or during any season, over those with which it comes into competition, or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions, will turn the balance.

With animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle between the males for possession of the females. The most vigorous individuals, or those which have most successfully struggled with their conditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But success will often depend on having special weapons or means of defence, or on the charms of the males; and the slightest advantage will lead to victory.

As geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical changes, we might have expected that organic beings would have varied under nature, in the same way as they generally have varied under the changed conditions of domestication. And if there be any variability under nature, it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play. It has often been asserted, but the assertion is quite incapable of proof, that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity. Man, though acting on external characters alone and often capriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one admits that there are at least individual differences in species under nature. But, besides such differences, all naturalists have admitted the existence of varieties, which they think sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works. No one can draw any clear distinction between individual differences and slight varieties; or between more plainly marked varieties and sub-species, and species. Let it be observed how naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many representative forms in Europe and North America.

If then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready to act and select, why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to beings, under their excessively complex relations of life, would be preserved, accumulated, and inherited? Why, if man can by patience select variations most useful to himself, should nature fail in selecting variations useful, under changing conditions of life, to her living products? What limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each creature,—favouring the good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to this power, in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life. The theory of natural selection, even if we looked no further than this, seems to me to be in itself probable. I have already recapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and objections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of the theory.

On the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species, commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws. On this same view we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species should present many varieties; for where the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in action; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. Moreover, the species of the larger genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of the larger genera apparently have restricted ranges, and they are clustered in little groups round other species—in which respects they resemble varieties. These are strange relations on the view of each species having been independently created, but are intelligible if all species first existed as varieties.

As each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase inordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species. Hence during a long-continued course of modification, the slight differences, characteristic of varieties of the same species, tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of the same genus. New and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older, less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects. Dominant species belonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still larger, and at the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups cannot thus succeed in increasing in size, for the world would not hold them, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character, together with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction, explains the arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to groups, all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere around us, and which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the theory of creation.

As natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive, favourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it can act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the canon of “Natura non facit saltum,” which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make more strictly correct, is on this theory simply intelligible. We can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should be a law of nature if each species has been independently created, no man can explain.

Many other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How strange it is that a bird, under the form of woodpecker, should have been created to prey on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which never or rarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet; that a thrush should have been created to dive and feed on sub-aquatic insects; and that a petrel should have been created with habits and structure fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe! and so on in endless other cases. But on the view of each species constantly trying to increase in number, with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts cease to be strange, or might even have been anticipated.

We can to a certain extent understand how it is that there is so much beauty throughout nature ; for this may be largely attributed to the agency of selection. That beauty, according to our sense of it, is not universal, must be admitted by every one who will look at some venomous snakes, at some fishes, and at certain hideous bats with a distorted resemblance to the human face. Sexual selection has given the most brilliant colours, elegant patterns, and other ornaments to the males, and sometimes to both sexes of many birds, butterflies, and other animals. With birds it has often rendered the voice of the male musical to the female, as well as to our ears. Flowers and fruit have been rendered conspicuous by brilliant colours in contrast with the green foliage, in order that the flowers may be easily seen, visited, and fertilised by insects, and the seeds disseminated by birds. How it comes that certain colours, sounds, and forms should give pleasure to man and the lower animals,—that is, how the sense of beauty in its simplest form was first acquired,—we do not know any more than how certain odours and flavours were first rendered agreeable.

As natural selection acts by competition, it adapts and improves the inhabitants of each country only in relation to their co-inhabitants; so that we need feel no surprise at the species of any one country, although on the ordinary view supposed to have been created and specially adapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised productions from another land. Nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect, as in the case even of the human eye; or if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not marvel at the sting of the bee, when used against an enemy, causing the bee's own death; at drones being produced in such great numbers for one single act, and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing waste of pollen by our fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen-bee for her own fertile daughters; at ichneumonidae feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars; or at other such cases. The wonder indeed is, on the theory of natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been detected.

The complex and little known laws governing the production of varieties are the same, as far as we can judge, with the laws which have governed the production of distinct species. In both cases physical conditions seem to have produced some direct and definite effect, but how much we cannot say. Thus, when varieties enter any new station, they occasionally assume some of the characters proper to the species of that station. With both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have produced a considerable effect; for it is impossible to resist this conclusion when we look, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings incapable of flight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck; or when we look at the burrowing tucu-tucu, which is occasionally blind, and then at certain moles, which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with skin; or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of America and Europe. With varieties and species, correlated variation seems to have played an important part, so that when one part has been modified other parts have been necessarily modified. With both varieties and species, reversions to long-lost characters occasionally occur. How inexplicable on the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulders and legs of the several species of the horse-genus and of their hybrids! How simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species are all descended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several domestic breeds of the pigeon are descended from the blue and barred rock-pigeon!

On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why should specific characters, or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other, be more variable than generic characters in which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species possess differently coloured flowers, than if all possessed the same coloured flowers? If species are only well-marked varieties, of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent, we can understand this fact; for they have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters, and therefore these same characters would be more likely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an enormous period. It is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus, and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great importance to the species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on my view, this part has undergone, since the several species branched off from a common progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and modification, and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable. But a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the wing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if the part be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been inherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have been rendered constant by long-continued natural selection.

Glancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural selection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts. I have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt sometimes comes into play in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not indispensable, as we see, in the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long-continued habit. On the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in common, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under considerably different conditions of life, yet should follow nearly the same instincts; why the thrush of South America, for instance, lines her nest with mud like our British species. On the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection we need not marvel at some instincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer.

If species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents,—in being absorbed into each other by successive crosses, and in other such points,—as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. On the other hand, these would be strange facts if species have been independently created, and varieties have been produced by secondary laws.

If we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree, then such facts as the record gives, support the theory of descent with modification. New species have come on the stage slowly and at successive intervals; and the amount of change, after equal intervals of time, is widely different in different groups. The extinction of species and of whole groups of species, which has played so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world, almost inevitably follows on the principle of natural selection; for old forms will be supplanted by new and improved forms. Neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation has once been broken. The gradual diffusion of dominant forms, with the slow modification of their descendants, causes the forms of life, after long intervals of time, to appear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world. The fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between the fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain of descent. The grand fact that all extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings, falling either into the same or into intermediate groups, follows from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents. As the groups which have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in character, the progenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants; and thus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is, the oftener it stands in some degree intermediate between existing and allied groups. Recent forms are generally looked at as being, in some vague sense, higher than ancient and extinct forms; and they are in so far higher as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in the struggle for life. Lastly, the law of the long endurance of allied forms on the same continent,—of marsupials in Australia, of edentata in America, and other such cases,—is intelligible, for within a confined country, the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent.

Looking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to another, owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand, on the theory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in Distribution. We can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space, and in their geological succession throughout time; for in both cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of modification have been the same. We see the full meaning of the wonderful fact, which must have struck every traveller, namely, that on the same continent, under the most diverse conditions, under heat and cold, on mountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related; for they will generally be descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. On this same principle of former migration, combined in most cases with modification, we can understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the identity of some few plants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant mountains, under the most different climates; and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern temperate zones, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean. Although two areas may present the same physical conditions of life, we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different, if they have been for a long period completely separated from each other; for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all relations, and as the two areas will have received colonists from some third source or from each other, at various periods and in different proportions, the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be different.

On this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we can see why oceanic islands should be inhabited by few species, but of these, that many should be peculiar. We can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross wide spaces of ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, should not inhabit oceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of bats, which can traverse the ocean, should so often be found on islands far distant from any continent. Such facts as the presence of peculiar species of bats, and the absence of all other mammals, on oceanic islands, are utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation.

The existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas, implies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same parents formerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas, some identical species common to both still exist. Wherever many closely allied yet distinct species occur, many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species likewise occur. It is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence immigrants might have been derived. We see this in nearly all the plants and animals of the Galapagos archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the other American islands being related in the most striking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and those of the Cape de Verde archipelago and other African islands to the African mainland. It must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of creation.

The fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings constitute one grand natural system, with group subordinate to group, and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups, is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character. On these same principles we see how it is, that the mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so complex and circuitous. We see why certain characters are far more serviceable than others for classification;—why adaptive characters, though of paramount importance to the being, are of hardly any importance in classification; why characters derived from rudimentary parts, though of no service to the being, are often of high classificatory value; and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all. The real affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community of descent. The natural system is a genealogical arrangement, in which we have to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters, however slight their vital importance may be.

The framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse,—the same number of vertebrae forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant,—and innumerable other such facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications. The similarity of pattern in the wing and leg of a bat, though used for such different purpose,—in the jaws and legs of a crab,—in the petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, is likewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs, which were alike in the early progenitor of each class. On the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should be so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. We may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed branchiae.

Disuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an organ, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed conditions of life; and we can clearly understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs. But disuse and selection will generally act on each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power of acting on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. The calf, for instance, has inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw, from an early progenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe, that the teeth in the mature animal were reduced, during successive generations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the calf, the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse, and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the present day. On the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable it is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully will not understand.




I have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have thoroughly convinced me that species have changed, and are still slowly changing by the preservation and accumulation of successive slight favourable variations. Why, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species? It cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no variation; it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity; no clear distinction has been, or can be, drawn between species and well-marked varieties. It cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile, and varieties invariably fertile; or that sterility is a special endowment and sign of creation. The belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of short duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time, we are too apt to assume, without proof, that the geological record is so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species, if they had undergone mutation.

But the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves. The mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations.

Although I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly opposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the “plan of creation,” “unity of design,” etc., and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory. A few naturalists, endowed with much flexibility of mind, and who have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species, may be influenced by this volume; but I look with confidence to the future, to young and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality. Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction; for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.

Several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but that other species are real, that is, have been independently created. This seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that a multitude of forms, which till lately they themselves thought were special creations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of naturalists, and which consequently have every external characteristic feature of true species,—they admit that these have been produced by variation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms. Nevertheless they do not pretend that they can define, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which are those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a vera causa in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without assigning any distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth's history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? Were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals, were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother's womb? Although naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability of species, on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they consider reverent silence.

It may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of species. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct the forms are which we may consider, by so much the arguments fall away in force. But some arguments of the greatest weight extend very far. All the members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of affinities, and all can be classified on the same principle, in groups subordinate to groups. Fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between existing orders. Organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed state; and this in some instances necessarily implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants. Throughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same pattern, and at an embryonic age the species closely resemble each other. Therefore I cannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same class. I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.

Analogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype. But analogy may be a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in common, in their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their cellular structure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. We see this even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. Therefore I should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life was first breathed.




When the views entertained in this volume on the origin of species, or when analogous views are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history. Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a species. This I feel sure, and I speak after experience, will be no slight relief. The endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of British brambles are true species will cease. Systematists will have only to decide (not that this will be easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name. This latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms, if not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species. Hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction between species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or believed, to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected. Hence, without quite rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them. It is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names, as with the primrose and cowslip; and in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance. In short, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.

The other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly in interest. The terms used by naturalists of affinity, relationship, community of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive characters, rudimentary and aborted organs, etc., will cease to be metaphorical, and will have a plain signification. When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from experience, will the study of natural history become!

A grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the causes and laws of variation, on correlation of growth, on the effects of use and disuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth. The study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. A new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interesting subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species. Our classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made, genealogies; and will then truly give what may be called the plan of creation. The rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we have a definite object in view. We possess no pedigrees or armorial bearings; and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any kind which have long been inherited. Rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long-lost structures. Species and groups of species, which are called aberrant, and which may fancifully be called living fossils, will aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life. Embryology will reveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes of each great class.

When we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species, and all the closely allied species of most genera, have within a not very remote period descended from one parent, and have migrated from some one birthplace; and when we better know the many means of migration, then, by the light which geology now throws, and will continue to throw, on former changes of climate and of the level of the land, we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world. Even at present, by comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature of the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.

The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence of circumstances, and the blank intervals between the successive stages as having been of vast duration. But we shall be able to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms. We must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneous two formations, which include few identical species, by the general succession of their forms of life. As species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism,—the improvement of one being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time. A number of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within this same period, several of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign associates, might become modified; so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time. During early periods of the earth's history, when the forms of life were probably fewer and simpler, the rate of change was probably slower; and at the first dawn of life, when very few forms of the simplest structure existed, the rate of change may have been slow in an extreme degree. The whole history of the world, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by us, will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time, compared with the ages which have elapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living descendants, was created.

In the distant future I see open fields for far more important researches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.

Authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator, that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining the birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of each genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it will be the common and widely-spread species, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the Silurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works solely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection.

It is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many plants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various insects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each other, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been produced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense, being Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase so high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural Selection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of less-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death, the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the production of the higher animals, directly follows. There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.
