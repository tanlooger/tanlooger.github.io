译者前言


本书作者马克·吐温是美国批判现实主义文学的奠基人，世界著名的小说家。他经历了美国从初期资本主义到帝国主义的发展过程，其思想和创作也表现为从轻快奚落到辛辣讽刺再到悲观厌世的发展阶段。前期以辛辣的讽刺见长，但到了后期语言更为暴露激烈。他于1835年出生于密西西比河畔小城汉尼拔的一个贫穷的乡村律师家庭。青少年时期曾当过排字工人，在密西西比河上做过领航员。四年的水上生活是他一生中最难忘的经历，使他有机会接触到广阔的社会，加深了对美国人民的认识和了解，为他日后的创作积累了大量宝贵的写作素材。马克·吐温于1910年4月21日去世。

“马克·吐温”是他最常使用的笔名，一般认为这个笔名是源自其早年水手生涯，与其伙伴测量水深时，他的伙伴叫道“Mark Twain！”，意思是“两个标记”，亦即水深两寻（1寻约1.8米），这是轮船安全航行的必要条件。

马克·吐温的第一部作品是《卡拉维拉斯郡著名的跳蛙》，于1865年发表在《纽约周六报刊》上，受到读者的欢迎。1867年马克·吐温在欧洲和中东旅游。这一游导致了《傻子旅行》的诞生。1872年，马克·吐温出版了第二部旅行文学著作《艰苦岁月》作为《傻子旅行》的续集。马克·吐温之后的两本著作均是关于他在密西西比河上的经历。《密西西比河的旧日时光》本是一系列在《大西洋月刊》连载的小品，在1875年结集出版。之后马克·吐温写了《汤姆·索亚历险记》《王子与贫儿》《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》等作品。

《汤姆·索亚历险记》是马克·吐温的代表作，发表于1876年。小说主人公汤姆·索亚天真活泼，不喜欢学校呆板枯燥的教育，并极度厌恶牧师骗人的鬼话。他不堪忍受束缚个性、枯燥乏味的生活，幻想干一番英雄事业。小说通过主人公的冒险经历，对美国虚伪庸俗的社会习俗、伪善的宗教仪式和刻板陈腐的学校教育进行了讽刺和批判，以欢快的笔调描写了少年儿童自由活泼的心灵。《汤姆·索亚历险记》以其浓厚的深具地方特色的幽默和对人物的敏锐观察，一跃成为最伟大的儿童文学作品之一。

《汤姆·索亚历险记》是一本非常有趣的书，阅读的时候切莫一本正经地去探讨重大严肃的社会意义，寻找创造过惊天动地业绩的英雄人物，那定会使你失望；不论你是大人，还是孩童，若是愿意放下身段，忘却自我，以纯净之心与故事中的人物同忧共乐，定会从中获得无穷的生活乐趣，也会洞察到人间的善恶美丑。

本书的主人公汤姆是一位失去父母的孤儿，由姨妈抚养。他调皮捣蛋、贪玩、逃学、极富冒险精神和好奇心，令抚养他的姨妈伤透了脑筋，令管教他的老师束手无策，这样一个令人又恨又疼的小捣蛋鬼，却是小伙伴们羡慕的对象。礼拜天他被罚粉刷栅栏，原本是个“苦差事”，可他居然假装干得津津有味，惹得小伙伴们用大量的玩具换取享受劳动的片刻快乐；他成绩极差，却用粉刷栅栏得来的玩具，换了大量的“票子”，从而获得了学校至高无上的荣誉——《圣经》；他让小猫喝下“止痛药”，闹得全家天翻地覆，表面看小猫遭了大罪，实际上是给姨妈上了一课，让她后悔不迭……如此好玩的故事书中随处可见，举不胜举。我们读着这些充满生活情趣、笔调轻松诙谐的故事，无不为汤姆的聪明机智而叫绝，并报之一笑。

汤姆虽然顽劣，却有一颗很强的同情心，极富正义感。他正直，诚实，遇到困难镇定自若，冷静分析，并勇于尝试解决问题。他对外界的事物总是充满好奇心和想象力，而且大胆尝试，机智勇敢，向往自由，向往未来。他目睹一起凶杀案的发生，眼看凶犯逍遥法外，而无辜者蒙冤受屈，既害怕出来告发而被真凶追杀，又不忍无辜者受罪，备受良心折磨，但经过激烈的思想斗争之后，最终挺身而出，当庭作证，使案情大白于天下。

本书定名于“历险记”，作者自然对主人公的历险经历作了一番详细的描述。其中便有密西西比河中的一个小岛之行。汤姆·索亚带领乔·哈珀与哈克贝利·费恩，一行三人在孤岛上无拘无束的胡闹与嬉戏中得到了由衷的幸福，但思家之苦和暴风雨的洗礼终使当海盗的美梦破灭，这次历险也以失败而告终。墓地的历险显然是对主人公心灵的一次严峻考验。而此后的山洞探宝、勇救道格拉斯寡妇等等情节无不与之有千丝万缕的关系。正是这一次次历险凸显了汤姆及其伙伴们的生活、性格的方方面面，更构成了他们丰富多彩的心路历程。

我们不妨将汤姆与贝基的“恋情”也看作是他一生的早年“历险”。说他俩产生了“恋情”未必确切，充其量，那只是两个少不经事的少年男女的“好奇心”的一次表现，原本不必大惊小怪，作者不惜笔墨，无非是想让好玩的故事更加好玩，加点“佐料”，让历险故事读起来更有“娱乐”性而已。

书中另一个形象同样引起人们的兴趣，他就是哈克贝利·费恩。哈克是个无家可归的流浪儿，身上有不少恶习，抽烟、说脏话，甚至还小偷小摸，是镇上做父母的人避之唯恐不及的“坏孩子”，但却是汤姆·索亚的好伙伴。两个人意气相投，一起历险，共患难，同享受。可他天生具有叛逆的精神，不愿受种种“规矩”束缚，即使有了钱，他还是觉得睡木桶、穿破衣的生活自在。这个形象令人不禁想起我国那个家喻户晓的早期的“孙悟空”来。有关哈克贝利·费恩的未来命运，有兴趣的读者可去阅读《汤姆·索亚历险记》的姐妹篇《哈克贝利·费恩历险记》，该书将有非常有意思的故事等着你欣赏。

正如作者在本书的序中所说，这虽是一本供少年男女娱乐的读物，成年人切莫“冷落”它，因为“读了此书能愉快地回忆起自己童年时的情景，回忆起当年自己的所思所感，回忆起自己的言谈和有时出现的怪异举动”。诚哉斯言。许多人童年无不经历过汤姆早年所经历过的一些“历险”，因而读起来倍感亲切，欲罢不能。

作者序


本书所叙述的大多数历险故事都实有其事。其中一两件也是我亲身经历过的。有些孩子还是我小学的同学。哈克贝利·费恩这个人物源自生活。汤姆·索亚同样如此，只是不单取材于一人，而是集中了我所认识的三个孩子的特点综合而成，所以这一形象相当于建筑学上所谓的混合型结构。

书中提到的一些荒诞不经的迷信习俗，在本故事发生的时期——也就是三四十年前，在西部的儿童和奴隶中非常流行。

虽说本书主要是为男女少年所写的读物，供他们娱乐之用，但我希望成年男女不会因此而冷落了它，因为本书还有一个目的是帮助成年人读了此书能愉快地回忆起自己童年时的情景，回忆起当年自己的所思所感，回忆起自己的言谈和有时出现的怪异举动。

第一章


“汤姆！”

没人答应。

“汤姆！”

没人答应。

“怪哩，这孩子倒是怎么啦？汤姆，你在哪儿呀？”

还是没人答应。

老太太把眼镜往下拉了拉，目光从镜架上打量一番房间，再把眼镜向上推了推，又从镜架下看了看外面。像小孩这样的小东西，她很少，或压根儿不用眼镜去找；她戴眼镜完全是为了“派头”，起着装饰作用，你看这眼镜多有气魄，让她内心感到无比自豪——她的眼力是一流的，眼睛上哪怕架上的是火炉盖，东西照样能看得一清二楚。此时她显得有点不知所措，说起话来倒算不上严厉，但嗓门很高，高得连家具也能听清楚：

“没错，要是你让我给逮住，看我准……”

她没把话说完，只是弯着腰用扫把一个劲往床底捅，边捅边喘粗气，可除了惊扰了一只猫，她一无所获。

“我从来没见过这样的孩子！”

她来到敞开着的门前，站在门里，目光朝院子里的番茄茎和曼陀罗草丛扫视。汤姆不在那里。她便把嗓门提得高高的，这下大老远就能听到她的喊声了：

“汤姆，我说的是你！”

她的身后响起轻轻的响声，她急忙转过身，一把抓住一个小孩紧身短上衣的衣角，这下对方休想逃走了。

“嗨！我该想到房间里衣柜才是。你躲在那儿干吗？”

“没干吗。”

“没干吗？瞧瞧你这双手，再瞧瞧你那张嘴。满嘴角沾的倒是什么玩意儿？”

“姨妈，我说不上。”

“我可知道。不是果酱是什么？我给你说过不下四十遍了，要是再动那果酱，看我不剥你的皮。去把鞭子给我拿来。”

鞭子被举得老高，眼看大祸就要临头。

“哟！瞧你背后，姨妈！”

老太太以为有什么险情，慌忙转过身，撩起裙子，小家伙借机拔腿就跑，纵身跳过高高的栅栏，眨眼间不见了踪影。

波莉姨妈目瞪口呆地站了好一会儿，这才轻声地笑起来。

“该死的小家伙，我怎么就没汲取教训呢？瞧他老来这一套，这次我怎么没提防又被耍了呢？不是吗，人老硬是学不了乖，真是应了老话：老狗学不了新把戏。天知道，他的鬼花样天天翻新，谁知道接下去他还会使出什么新花招。他可懂得火候哩，知道怎么不玩过了头，免得惹我生气，怎么逗我开心，让我消气，这下又来这一套，知道我不会揍他。说实在的，还是怪我没尽到管教的职责。《圣经》说得好，孩子不打不成器，这才是大道理。我知道自己这是在作孽，害得彼此都受罪。他都成了小流氓了。全怪我。他是我那死去姐姐的孩子，可怜的小家伙，我又不忍心揍他。可每次放过他，我的良心又感到不安；打他吧，我这颗老迈的心疼得不行，下不了手。得了，得了，人都是女人生的，命本就不长，苦难却不少，《圣经》就是这么说的，这话说到家了。要是今儿下午他逃课，明儿就让他干活，好好教训他一顿。星期六，别的孩子都在休息，让他干活，可是很难才能办到。他呀，最不愿做的事就是干活。我想好了，我要尽尽职，非让他干点活不可了，要不可就毁了这孩子了。”

这天汤姆果然逃学了，而且痛痛快快地玩了一阵子。回家正赶上帮助黑人小孩吉姆在晚饭前锯好第二天用的柴火，还劈好引火柴——至少他忘不了把自己的奇遇都告诉了吉姆，不过那活儿四分之三是吉姆干的。汤姆的弟弟（确切地说，他同母异父的弟弟）锡德已干完分内的活（收拾碎柴片儿）。他是个文静的孩子，不会做什么危险的事儿，也不会惹是生非。

吃晚饭的时候，一有机会汤姆就偷糖吃，波莉姨妈问他一些刁钻而深奥的问题，设法套出他又干了什么坏事来。像许多头脑简单的人一样，她自有很强的虚荣心，自以为天生别具一套能耐，能一眼识破别人无法破解的奥秘。她问：

“汤姆，学校里挺热的吧？”

“是挺热的，姨妈。”

“热得不行吧？”

“是热得不行，姨妈。”

“你没想到过去游泳吧，汤姆？”

汤姆只感到浑身一阵惊慌——既难受又疑虑。他仔细打量波莉姨妈的脸色，但看不出什么来，便说：

“没想过，姨妈——可不，不很想。”

老太太伸出手，摸了摸汤姆的衬衫，说：

“可你这会儿并不很热。”

她已发现那衬衫是干的，而别人却看不出她这么做到底打的什么主意，对此她感到十分得意。不料汤姆已看穿了她的用意，便来个先发制人：

“我们几个在水龙头下淋了淋脑袋——我的头发这会儿还湿着呢。看见没有？”

波莉姨妈一想到自己怎么就没想到这一茬，把大好机会给错失掉了，顿时感到很是懊恼。不过她灵机一动，又想出新招来：

“汤姆，淋脑袋的时候，你没解下我给你缝的衬衫领子吧？把外衣解开！”

汤姆的脸上顿时没了焦虑的神色，他解开外衣。他的衬衫领子还好好地缝在上面。

“得了！好吧，你去吧。我认定你一准逃了学游泳去了。不过这回我不计较，汤姆。我看你呀，就是一只所谓的毛被烧焦的猫——外焦里不焦。至少这回是这样。”

她既为自己的招数没有奏效感到遗憾，同时又为汤姆这一回还算听话而感到快慰。

可锡德说：

“得了吧，我记得你给他缝领子的线是白的，可如今都成黑线了。”

“可不是，我那是用白线缝的，汤姆！”

可汤姆没有理会，拔腿就跑，到了门口，冲着锡德说：

“锡德，你这是欠揍。”

汤姆到了安全的地方，停下脚步，检查起插在外衣领子上的两枚粗针，针上还绕着线——一根是白线，另一根是黑线。他说：

“要不是被锡德说穿，她是不会看出破绽来的。讨厌！她一会儿用白线缝，一会儿用黑线缝。把人都搞糊涂了，要是单用一种颜色的线就好办了。我发誓，为这事非要教训锡德一顿不可。我说到做到。”

他不是村子里的乖孩子，可他非常非常了解那个乖孩子，而且对他讨厌透顶。

两分钟后，也许还不到两分钟，汤姆早已把那些个烦恼事丢到了九霄云外去了。这倒不是说他的烦恼不像大人的烦恼那样令人沉重痛苦，只是因为这会儿一件新鲜又有趣的事强烈地吸引了他，一时间把烦恼事丢到了脑后——凡人遇到新的兴奋事时往往会把痛苦忘掉的。这新鲜而有趣的事便是一种既新奇又有趣的吹口哨法，是他刚从一个黑人那里学来的，他正愁着找个没人打扰的地方练它一练呢。这种口哨能吹出一种独特的鸟声，吹的时候把舌尖顶着上颚，就能发出断断续续流水般清脆的颤音——诸位读者应该记得自己还是孩子的时候会这种把戏的。汤姆拼命地练，专心地学，很快就掌握了诀窍。于是他在大街上迈开步子，嘴里发出悦耳的口哨声，心里洋溢着感恩之情。那高兴劲活像是天文学家发现了一颗新天体——毫无疑问，那兴奋劲比天文学家还要强烈，还要深沉，还要纯真。

夏天的黄昏很漫长。天还没有黑。这时汤姆猛地停止了吹口哨。他的面前出现了一个陌生人——身影比他要大的男孩子。在圣彼得斯堡可怜的小村子里，一旦来了一个陌生人，不论他是男是女，是老是小，都会引起大家强烈的好奇心。这个新来的男孩子衣着讲究——在周末，这样的打扮算是够讲究的了，不能不引得大家万分惊讶。他头上的帽子相当精致，蓝色上衣又新又漂亮，扣子扣得紧紧的，显得干净利落，裤子也不例外。脚上还穿着鞋子哩——今儿可是星期五呀1。他甚至还打着领结，很漂亮的缎子领结。他那一股子城里人的气派让汤姆看得很不是滋味。他越瞧对方这身鲜亮的古怪打扮，鼻子翘得越高，越发感到自己的穿戴寒酸破烂。两个孩子谁也不吭声。一个挪一步，对方也挪一步，但只是朝身旁挪，彼此绕着圈子，面对面，眼对眼，盯着对方。最后还是汤姆开了口：

“我可要揍你！”

“我倒要看看你有没有这个胆。”

“哼，我可要动手啦。”

“我看你不敢。”

“我敢。”

“不，你不敢。”

“我敢。”

“你不敢。”

“敢。”

“不敢！”

令人难堪地停顿了一会儿，汤姆问：

“你叫什么名字？”

“这你兴许管不着吧？”

“管得着。我偏要管。”

“行，管来看看。”

“你要是再说废话，我就要管了。”

“我就说，就说，就说。你动手吧！”

“哼，你以为自己了不起吧，是不是？要是我想，可以一只手绑在身后，一手就能搞定你。”

“好哇，干吗不动手？你不是说敢吗？”

“行！要是你耍我，看我敢不敢。”

“像你这样空口说大话的人我见得多了。”

“好个自作聪明的家伙！你以为你是谁？哦，瞧那帽子多难看。”

“难看也得看。谅你也不敢摘下它。谁要是敢动它，我就叫他吃不了兜着走。”

“你吹牛。”

“你吹的牛也不赖。”

“你是只会动嘴不敢动手的吹牛家。”

“我说你给我滚到一边去。”

“给我听好了，要是再跟我说粗话，看我不拿石头砸你的脑瓜子。”

“你试试。”

“我当然会试。”

“那你干吗不动手？干吗光动嘴巴就是不动手呢？我想你是怕了。”

“我才不怕哩。”

“你就是怕。”

“我不怕。”

“怕。”

又是片刻停顿，彼此再次大眼瞪小眼，兜着圈子。然后肩对肩顶了起来。汤姆开了口：

“滚开！”

“你自个儿滚开。”

“我不。”

“我也不。”

两人就这么站着，双腿叉开，像只支架，撑在地上，双方怒目而视，推推搡搡，可谁也占不了上风，结果两个人斗得汗流浃背，满脸通红，这才小心翼翼慢慢地松了劲，汤姆才说：

“你是个胆小鬼，是条小狗。我要叫我大哥哥来对付你。他只要动动小指头就能收拾你。我会让他这么做的。”

“谁怕你的大哥哥？我也有哥哥，他比你的哥哥还要厉害。他能把你的哥哥扔过栅栏去。”（这两个哥哥都是瞎编出来的。）

“你尽说大话。”

“你说的也是大话，不算数。”

汤姆拿大脚趾在泥地上画了一条线，说：

“你要是敢跨过这条线，我就要揍得你趴在地上爬不起来。看谁敢试试，都要落到同样下场。”

新来的孩子听罢立即跨过了线，还说：

“你不是说要揍我吗，动手吧。”

“别来逼我，给我当心点。”

“你不是说要揍我吗，怎么不动手？”

“好哇！拿两分钱来，我准揍扁你。”

新来的孩子从口袋里掏出两枚大铜子儿，伸出手，带着嘲弄的神色，递了过去。汤姆一巴掌把铜子儿打落在地。说时迟，那时快，两个孩子，像两只小猫，立即在泥地上扭成了一团，翻来滚去，又是揪头发，又是扯衣衫，又是抓鼻子，落得都成了泥猴子，还挺得意哩。很快成败就有了结果。汤姆从战尘中露出身子，只见他直挺挺地骑在那新来孩子身上，双拳狠擂着对方。

“快求饶吧！”他说。

那孩子竭力挣扎着要脱身，嘴里一个劲地哭哭嚷嚷——主要是被气的。

“求不求饶？”说着，拳头一个劲落下去。

最后那陌生的孩子喘着粗气，说了声“饶”，汤姆才放开他，让他站了起来，并说：

“这下你可知道厉害了吧，下次最好看清楚了，你这是在耍哪个。”

新来的孩子拍着身上的尘土，抽抽搭搭，晃着脑袋，不时回过头来，威胁汤姆说“下次被他撞见，准要收拾他”。汤姆只嘲弄地报之一笑，得意洋洋地转身离去。他刚转过身，那陌生的孩子捡起一块石子儿，扔了过来，击中了汤姆的后背，接着便转身，像只羚羊似的逃之夭夭。汤姆拔腿就追这个反复无常的家伙，直追到了他家门口，这样就知道他住在哪里了。汤姆在他家门口守了老半天，就是不见冤家出来，那冤家只是在窗口朝他做鬼脸，拒绝出战。后来冤家的妈妈出现了，她骂汤姆是邪恶的小坏蛋，没教养，呵斥他滚开。汤姆只好离开，临走时说他是不会放过那孩子的。

晚上汤姆很迟才回到家。他小心翼翼翻窗进家时，不料中了姨妈的埋伏。姨妈一见他衣服的惨状，更加坚定了自己的决心，星期六非要让他干重活不可了。





第二章


星期六早晨就要到了。夏天，大千世界一片明朗清新，处处生机勃勃。人人心里都唱着歌儿，倘若你有一颗年轻的心，这歌声就会从嘴唇上流露出来。人人脸上都喜气洋洋，每一个步子都轻盈矫健。洋槐树花满枝头，芳香扑鼻。村子远处，高耸着的是卡迪夫山，山上草木青葱，远望恰如怡人的绿洲，朦胧、静谧而引人入胜。

汤姆拎着石灰桶，拿着长柄刷子，来到路边小道上。他打量一番栅栏，满心的欢喜一扫而光，不禁涌起一股深深的悲伤。那可是一排长三十码、高九英尺的栅栏！他只觉得人生变得一片空虚，像是身上压上累累重担。他唉声叹气，刷子蘸了蘸石灰水，从栅栏顶层刷了起来。他一遍又一遍地蘸刷子、刷栅栏，可剩下那一大片未刷的地方一眼望不到边，相比之下，刷过的部分实在微不足道了。想到这里他心灰意冷，不由一屁股坐到护木箱上。就在这时候，吉姆一手提着洋铁桶，一蹦一跳从大门跑了出来，嘴里还哼着《布法罗的姑娘》哩。过去，在汤姆心目中，从镇上泵站拎水是件十分讨厌的活儿，可这会儿他便不这么想了。他不由想到，泵站里聚着许许多多小伙伴，男男女女，有白人的孩子，有混血儿，还有黑人的孩子。他们排着队等着，有休息的，有交换玩具的，有吵架的，有的打闹，有的嬉戏，不一而足。他记得，那泵站离家虽说只有一百五十码，可吉姆拎一桶水来回得花上一个小时的时间，有时甚至还得有人去催他。想到这里，汤姆便说：

“我说，吉姆，你来刷栅栏，我去提水吧。”

吉姆摇了摇头，说：

“哪能呢，汤姆少爷。老太太吩咐过了，让我快点把水拎回来，不可半路上跟别人玩。老太太还说，她料到汤姆少爷会要我替他刷栅栏，所以吩咐我路上别耽搁，管好自己的事——她说，刷栅栏的事她会亲自过问的。”

“千万别听她说的，吉姆。她就爱这么说。把水桶给我，我要不了一分钟就回来。她发觉不了。”

“噢，汤姆少爷，不行。老太太会揪下我的脑瓜子的。她说到做到。”

“她吗？她从不揍人——大不了只是拿着顶针在人家头顶上比划比划。你说，谁怕这个呢？别听她话说得厉害，这伤害得了谁？只要她不哭哭闹闹就万事大吉了。吉姆，我送你一件意想不到的玩意儿。一只白色弹珠子。”

吉姆犹豫起来了。

“白弹珠，吉姆！那可是顶呱呱的弹珠子。”

“老天爷！我说，这果真是天大的好东西！可汤姆少爷，我真的怕老太太哩。”

“还有，要是你愿意，我可以把自己发了炎的脚指头让你看看。”

吉姆毕竟是个凡人，这话太让人动心了。于是他放下水桶，拿过白弹珠。他弯下身子仔细地看着汤姆解开脚上的绷带，露出那发了炎的脚指头。不一会儿，他感到屁股火辣辣地疼痛，但他顾不得疼痛，拎起水桶，飞快地拔腿就跑。而汤姆又使劲地刷起了栅栏，波莉姨妈则一手拿着拖鞋，双眼洋溢着得意的神色，撤离了“战场”。

汤姆的劲头没维持多久。他想起打算今天要做的好玩事儿，倍感心酸。那些无拘无束的孩子会打这儿经过，去玩各种各样有趣的游戏，他们会因为他得干活而取笑他——一想到这里，他的心便火烧火燎地难受。他掏出自己的宝贝，仔仔细细地打量起来——几件玩具，几颗弹珠子及一些破破烂烂的玩意儿。用这些东西收买人家替自己干活也许还能凑合，可要是换来哪怕是半小时的真正自由怕是还差大半截哩。于是他把这些可怜的东西放回口袋，打消了收买孩子的念头。就在这看来绝望而黑暗的时刻，他心头猛生出一个绝妙的主意！顶呱呱而非同寻常的主意！

汤姆拿起了刷子，不动声色地干起活来。这时候本·罗杰斯来了。在一帮男孩子中，汤姆最怕的就是被他嘲笑。你看他一蹦一跳地过来——一眼就看出，他这时正兴高采烈，满怀着期望。他嘴里啃着苹果，时不时吹着悠长的口哨，煞是动听，接着又是一声声叮咚咚叮咚咚声，分明是在模仿汽船声。“汽船”驶近了，放慢了速度，到了街中央，“船身”往右一侧，慢慢地来了个大转弯，显得挺认真，挺费劲，因为他这是在模仿“大密苏里号”船，把自己当作是吃水九英尺的大船。他身兼汽船、船长和汽笛的重任，所以想象中自己身处上层甲板上，要对他人发号施令，自己又要听令执行。

“停船，伙计！丁——零——零。”于是“船”几乎停了下来，慢慢地向人行小道靠了过来。

“掉转船头！丁——零——零。”他的手臂绷得紧紧的，笔直伸出，紧贴在身体两侧。

“右舷向后！丁——零——零。呜——呜——呜！”他说着，右手煞有介事地画着圈，表明那是个四十英尺的大舵轮。

“左舷向后！丁——零——零！呜——呜——呜！”他的左手画出一个个圆圈。

“右舷轮停！丁——零——零！左舷轮停！右舷轮向前！停！外舷轮慢慢转过来！丁——零——零！呜——呜——呜！抛前缆绳！快！喂——抛后缆绳——我说，你这是干吗？把缆绳在船桩上绕它一圈！就这么着——松手！熄火，伙计！丁——零——零！”“唏，唏！唏！”（他这是在模仿试水位旋塞发出的声音。）

汤姆径自埋头刷栅栏，没去理会“汽船”。本盯着他好一会儿，才开了口：

“嘿，你惹上麻烦了，是不是？”

没有答理。汤姆像个画家，打量起自己最后那一刷，又用刷子轻轻地一抹，像刚才那样，审视起所得的效果来。本在他身旁来回走着。那只苹果惹得汤姆直流口水，但他还是埋头干活。本说：

“喂，老伙计，你还得干活吗，嗯？”

汤姆突然转过身来，说：

“哟，是你呀，本！真想不到。”

“我说，我这要游泳去了，没错。你不想去吗？你当然是想干活，是不是？当然是想干活！”

汤姆打量一眼对方，说：

“你说，什么叫干活？”

“怎么，这不是干活吗？”

汤姆继续刷着，漫不经心地说：

“可不，也许是叫干活，也许这不叫干活。据我所知，这才称汤姆·索亚的心。”

“得了，得了，你不是说你还挺喜欢干这事儿吧？”

刷子继续在刷着。

“喜欢？我干吗不该喜欢？小孩子家能天天捞到刷栅栏的机会吗？”

事情有了转机。本不再啃苹果了。汤姆来来回回仔细刷着栅栏——刷了一道，退后一步，细看刷出来的效果——这里那里添上一刷——又看看效果——本看着他的每一个动作，兴趣越来越浓，越来越被吸引过去，他很快便说：

“我说，汤姆，让我也刷几下吧。”

汤姆想了想，刚想答应，又改变了主意。

“不行，不行。这恐怕不行，本。波莉姨妈对这栅栏可挑剔着哩——你是知道的，这到底是面朝大街的栅栏，要是在屋后，那无所谓，她也不会太在意。可不是，她对这栅栏可挑剔哩，得仔仔细细地刷。我看，能干好这事儿的孩子，都是千里挑一、万里挑一的。”

“不会吧——哪能呢？噢，得了。让我试试吧，只一小会儿。换了我，就会让你试试的，汤姆。”

“本，说实在的，我倒是愿意让你刷一会儿，可波莉姨妈——不是吗，吉姆也想刷刷，可她就是不让。锡德想干，波莉姨妈也不让。你看我有多为难？要是让你来刷这栅栏，还不知道会出什么乱子——”

“噢，得了吧。我会小心的。这就让我来试试吧。要么——我把苹果核给你。”

“行——不，本，还是不行，我怕——”

“我把苹果全给你得了！”

汤姆把刷子给了本，脸上装出老大不情愿的样子，可内心别提有多高兴了。在这艘原本叫“大密苏里号”的汽船在烈日下，干得大汗淋漓的时候，这撒手的画家却端坐在附近的阴凉处的水桶上，晃荡着双脚，啃着苹果，脑子里盘算着如何去“宰杀”更多的无辜者。宰杀的对象不乏其人。时不时就会有男孩子过来。他们原本是想来取笑他的，结果都留下来刷栅栏了。这时的本已累得筋疲力尽，汤姆已与比利·费舍尔做好了一笔交易，把下一个机会给了他，换来一只状况挺不错的风筝。费舍尔玩腻了，约翰尼·米勒来了，他以一只死耗子，连同拴耗子的绳子的代价买来这大好机会。时间一小时一小时过去，来挨宰的孩子纷至沓来。到了午后，汤姆已由一名一无所有的穷小子，摇身一变，成了地地道道的大富翁。除了上述的那些财富外，他还拥有十二颗弹珠，一只破口琴，一片透明的蓝色玻璃片，一架用线轴做的炮，一把什么也开不了的钥匙，一小截粉笔，一只酒瓶塞，一个洋铁皮士兵，一对蝌蚪，六只爆竹，一只独眼小猫，一只铜把手，一个狗颈圈——可惜的是没连着狗——一只小刀的刀柄，四块橘子皮，还有一块破窗框。

与此同时，他还过得逍遥自在，喜气洋洋——许多人陪着他玩——栅栏呢，先后被粉刷了三遍。要不是石灰水告罄，他准会让全村的男孩子个个变成穷光蛋。

这下汤姆暗自思忖，这世界毕竟不是无情无义的，于是他对人类的行为规律有一大发现：要想让大人或孩子巴不得想做某件事，就得设法让这东西难到手。要是他也像本书作者那样，是位聪明的大哲学家，那就得懂一个道理：活，孩子家必得要干，玩呢，不是非玩不可。明白了这道理，就知道，制作假花或踩水车便是干活，而滚保龄球或攀勃朗峰2是玩儿。英国就有那么一班家财万贯的绅士，夏天，他们每天都驾着四匹马拉的马车，赶上二三十英里的路，就因为他们有的是钱，这才享受了这份特权，要是让他们给人驾车收取工钱，那他们算是干活了，他们肯定不愿干的。

这孩子为面前的世道发生的实质上的变化着实琢磨了一阵子，然后动身到总部去报告。





第三章


汤姆来到波莉姨妈跟前，她就坐在一间舒适后房的敞开着的窗前。这房间既作卧室，又是吃早餐的地方，是餐室，又是书房，兼而有之。夏日宜人的空气，舒心的宁静，芬芳的花香，蜜蜂那令人昏昏欲睡的嗡嗡声，这一切交织在一起，产生了效力，使得她做起针线活来，做着做着打起了瞌睡——她身边除了一只小猫，可没有什么伴儿，而小猫这时也在她的膝盖上睡着了。她的眼镜稳稳地架在长着灰白头发的脑袋上。她原以为这会儿汤姆不知玩到哪里去了，想不到居然会无所畏惧地出现在她跟前。汤姆说：

“现在我能去玩会儿吗，姨妈？”

“什么，干完了？你刷了多少？”

“全刷完了，姨妈。”

“汤姆，别跟我撒谎——我受不了。”

“我没撒谎，全刷好了，姨妈。”

波莉姨妈听了这话半信半疑。她要出去亲眼看看。汤姆所说的话只要有百分二十是真的，她就心满意足了。她一见整座栅栏真的全刷好了，不但粉刷过了，而且精心地刷了一遍又一遍，甚至连地上也留下一道石灰印，直惊得她目瞪口呆。她说：

“哦，实在想不到！汤姆，要是你有心干活，还是挺能干的。”说罢，她又补上一句，把这好话冲淡了点：“可我不得不说，你有心干活的时候实在难得一见。得，玩儿去吧。不过别忘了回家，别玩了一星期也不想回家，要不看我不抽你。”

她被他这“辉煌的”成绩大大地感动了，高兴之余，把汤姆领到食品间，挑了只最好的苹果给他，同时忘不了教训他几句，说什么能享受到人家好生款待，是因为你自己诚心的努力结果，而不是凭歪门邪道，那才有价值，享用起来才有滋有味。就在姨妈以《圣经》中的一句漂亮话结束自己的教训时，汤姆顺手牵羊拿走了一块炸面包圈。

汤姆蹦蹦跳跳出了门，看见锡德正好在外面通往二楼后房的楼梯往上爬。泥团伸手就有，他拿起泥团就朝锡德扔，眨眼间，泥团漫天飞扬，锡德落入了泥团的暴风雨中。没等波莉姨妈从惊恐中回过神来去解围，锡德身上已中了六七块泥团，而汤姆早已翻过栅栏，逃之夭夭了。栅栏是有门的，可一般情况下汤姆没那个闲工夫从那里进出。谁叫锡德上次提醒姨妈说他衣领缝着的是黑线，给他惹来麻烦，现在报了这一箭之仇，让他感到心头好不痛快。

汤姆绕过房子，进了一条满是泥泞的小巷。姨妈牛栏的后门就开在这小巷里。到了这里，他就逃脱了被抓获、受到惩罚的危险了。他快步直奔村里的广场。那里事先约好有两支男孩子组成的“部队”，准备进行一场战斗。汤姆是其中一支部队的统帅，另一支由乔·哈珀（他的一个铁哥们）率领。这两位大统帅是不会亲自上阵的，那会有跌身价。打仗是小兵分内的事。统帅们只需端坐高处，通过参谋发号施令，指挥战斗。经过长时间艰苦的战斗，汤姆的军队取得了胜利。接着便是清点阵亡人数，交换俘虏，对下一次战斗尚有分歧的条款达成一致，约定下次交战日期。最后，两支军队排好队伍，撤离战场，汤姆也就孤身一人打道回府。

汤姆路过杰夫·撒切尔家房子时，看见院子里有位陌生的姑娘——小姑娘长着一对水灵的蓝眼睛，一头黄发扎成两条漂亮的长辫子，身穿一件白色的夏装，下着绣花宽松长裤。汤姆这位刚刚还在称王道霸的大英雄未经一枪一弹就被对方击倒，倒地不起了。某位芳名艾米·劳伦斯的姑娘立时从他的心中消失得无影无踪，没留下半丝回忆。他原认为自己爱她爱得如痴如狂，曾把这份激情看成是倾心的爱恋，如今只觉得那只不过是过眼烟云般的微小偏见，他曾花数月之久追求过她，可她在一星期前才接受他的爱。他自觉是世上最最幸福、最最自豪的男孩子，不料这种感觉只持续了短短七天，此时此刻，转眼间，她便像个不期而遇的访客，来去匆匆，从此从他心中彻底消失了。

他偷眼观看这位新天使，顿时涌起一股爱慕之心。他看着，看着，直待对方注意到了自己，他才把目光收了回来。然后他装模作样起来，仿佛对方并不存在似的，幼稚地“表演”种种可笑的男孩子的动作，以博得对方的青睐。他的种种愚蠢而荒诞的做派延续了一小会儿。就在他表演危险的体操动作时，猛地发现那女孩子径自朝房子走去。汤姆走到栅栏前，伤心地背靠栅栏。实指望她能多停留一会儿。她上了台阶，停下脚步，很快又向屋门走去。眼看她的脚跨上门槛，汤姆长叹了口气。但很快他喜出望外，原来一朵三色紫罗兰被抛过了栅栏，她的倩影这才消失在门内。

汤姆转身就跑，到了离那花一英尺，要么是两英尺的地方停下了脚步。他手搭凉棚，朝街那头看过去，仿佛发现那个方向发生什么有趣的事儿似的。他即刻捡起一根麦秆，把它放到鼻子上，同时脑袋尽量往后仰，让麦秆保持平衡。他身子费劲地左摇右晃，往前挪过去，离那花越来越近，最后一只光脚踩上了花，用灵活的脚趾夹住，带着宝贝，单脚跳着，人消失在拐角处。不过只一会儿，那是为了把花藏到外衣里去，藏在心口，也许紧贴胃的地方吧，反正他没学过解剖学，到底藏在哪里，这些细枝末节他是不会计较的。

汤姆又回到原来的地方，在栅栏前游来荡去，像刚才一样，耍着种种花招，到了夜幕降临才离开。那姑娘一直没有露面。可汤姆还心存希望，实指望她什么时候会在窗口出现，注意到自己，以此来自我安慰。最后他可怜巴巴地满怀着幻想，老大不愿意地回了家。

整个晚饭时间汤姆显得异常兴奋，惹得波莉姨妈直纳闷：“这孩子中了哪门子邪了？”他因用泥团打锡德而挨了一顿骂，可他满不在乎。他试图在姨妈鼻子底下偷糖吃，手指因而挨了敲打。他说：

“姨妈，锡德偷糖的时候，你干吗不打他？”

“可不是，锡德可不像你那样让人烦。要不是我一直提防着，你准会吃成糖人儿了。”

姨妈说罢进了厨房，锡德，领了“圣旨”，伸手就去拿糖罐——瞧他那得意劲，汤姆实在受不了。不料锡德手指一滑，糖罐掉到地上，碎了。汤姆见了高兴得不行，可还是控制住了嘴巴，一声不吭。他暗下决心，紧闭嘴巴，就是姨妈来了，什么也不说，只是乖乖地坐着，等着她来问这祸是哪个闯的，然后一五一十道出了真情，然后看着这“宠儿”挨剋，世上哪有比这称人心的事呢？老太太一回来，面对这一片“残局”，透过眼镜片，直冒怒火，汤姆见了乐不可支。他暗自想道：“终于要得到报应了！”不料他自己居然趴到地上去了！一见那高举的巴掌这就重重落下来，汤姆忙叫了起来：

“住手！你干吗揍我？糖罐是锡德摔的。”

姨妈住了手，满脸疑惑。汤姆以为姨妈这是要说句安慰他的话，但待她缓过神来，却说：

“哼！得，我估摸着，你就是挨点揍也不冤枉。我不在的时候，你准闯过别的大祸。错不了。”

然后，她受到了良心的谴责，很想说几句亲切而爱怜的话来安慰他，但一想，觉得这不等于自认是自己的不是了吗？这么一来不是坏了规矩了吗？所以她便保持了沉默，心情沉重地忙家务事去了。汤姆躲在角落里直生闷气，委屈得不行。不过他知道，姨妈内心已向他赔过不是了，想到这里，他忧郁的心灵得到了一丝满足。他不会主动向别人求和的，他才不理会人家哩。他知道，有一对怜悯的目光时不时透过泪水，在注视着自己，可他就是不理会。他想象自己一病不起，姨妈弯着身子，恳求他说句宽恕她的话，可他转身面对墙壁，至死也不会说那样的话。啊，那样一来她会有什么感想呢？他想象自己被人从河边抬回家，他死了。卷曲的头发湿漉漉的，双手僵硬，再也动不了啦，受伤的心停止了跳动。她会扑到他身上，泪如雨下，祈求上帝还给她的孩子，她再不骂他，永不骂他了。他就冰冷地躺着，脸色苍白，毫无气息——一个可怜的受害者。他的不幸就此结束。他的情感深深地沉浸在悲痛的梦魇中，害得他嗓子眼被呛住，不得不时时咽下口水。他的眼眶饱含泪水，眼皮一眨，就沿着鼻尖哗哗往下流。他在伤心中得到了宽慰，那简直是一大享受，是任何世俗的快慰和欢乐所不能替代和侵扰的，也是他不可容忍的。这太神圣了，任何人不得触碰。可就在这时候，他的表妹玛丽蹦蹦跳跳地走进来。她在乡下待了一星期，仿佛待了几年似的，又见到家，兴高采烈，喜气洋洋。如果说她带进来的是歌声和阳光，汤姆一见她则站了起来，带着阴云和黑暗，从另一扇门溜了出去。

他没有到孩子们常去的地方，而是远远地离开他们，找个与他心境相符的僻静处所，闲逛一番。河里一只木筏引起了他的兴趣，他在木筏边上坐了下来，凝视着那一片渺茫而阴沉沉的流水。巴不得自己这就被淹死，出其不意地死去，死得无知无觉，用不着受大自然所安排下的那种痛苦的折磨。这时候他想到了那朵花，随手拿了出来。花已经被揉皱，已经枯萎了。这令他那忧郁的心增添几分快活的感觉。他想知道，她一旦知道他的事，是不是会可怜他？她会哭吗？是不是希望自己有权搂住他的脖子安慰他？还是像世人，冷冰冰地掉头走掉？这画面在他的脑海萦绕着，给他带来既痛苦又欢快的感觉。他用种种不同的角度变换画面，直到智穷力尽，再也变不出新花样才罢休。最后他一声叹息，直起身子，在黑暗中走了。

到了九点半，要么是十点钟的时候，他到了渺无人迹的街上，来到那位不知名的人儿所居住的地方。他停下脚步，竖起耳朵听起来，可什么也没听到。二楼的一扇窗子的窗帘上映着昏暗的烛光，他心目中那神圣的人儿莫不是就在那儿？他越过栅栏，悄悄钻过树丛，径直在那窗下站了下来。他满怀激情抬头久久打量起来，然后索性仰天躺到窗下的地上，双手交叉在胸前，捧着那朵已经枯萎的可怜的花。他就要这样死去——离开这冰冷的世界。他这个无家可归的人头上无遮无盖，无人出于情谊来抹去他这已死之人额上的湿气，当极度痛苦降临之际，见不到有人怀着爱怜之情俯身看一眼他。到了第二天欢快的早晨，她探窗眺望时，定会发现他。啊，她会洒一滴微小的泪珠落到他可怜、僵死的身躯上？面对这原本生机勃勃的年轻生命受到残酷的摧残，过早地夭折，她会发出轻声的叹息吗？

窗子被拉上，一个女佣刺耳的声音打破了这圣洁的宁静。一大盆水自天而降，浇湿了这位仰卧在地的受难者的遗体！

大英雄被浇得喘不过气来，好不容易缓过了神，直哼哼，这才立了起来。猛听得嗖的一声，有东西飞了过来，夹杂着咒骂声，紧跟着的像是玻璃破裂声，昏暗中，一个模糊的小身影翻过栅栏，飞跑而去。

不久，汤姆脱掉衣衫准备上床，借着烛光细看烂湿的衣服时，锡德醒了过来。如果说他本想借机奚落汤姆一番，继而一想，还是作罢，不说为妙——因为这时汤姆眼露凶光。

汤姆看不出有什么烦恼，若无其事地做完了祈祷，钻进了被窝；这事儿锡德没有轻易放过，默默地记在心头。





第四章


大地一片宁静，太阳冉冉升起，阳光给这静谧的村子带来了福音。吃完了早餐，波莉姨妈领着全家人做祷告。开始的祷文始终引自《圣经》，固定不变，但其间也黏合一些她自己的创意，到达高潮时，姨妈宣读起《摩西律法》中最严肃的一章，就像摩西在西奈山顶上传达上帝旨意似的。

然后，汤姆准备行动，也就是说，开始“背诵经文”。锡德几天前早已记住了这些经文。汤姆使出吃奶的力气，去熟记五段经文，他选的是最简单的“登山宝训”这部分。半小时后，汤姆对自己的功课已有了模模糊糊的印象，仅此而已，因为他的心灵全在人世驰骋，他的双手忙个不停，令他分心不已。玛丽拿过他的书本，听他背诵，可他在重重迷雾中左冲右突，寻找路径。

“虚心的人有——有——有”。

“福了——”

“对了——是虚心的人。虚心的人有福了——虚心的人——虚心的人——”

“虚心——”

“虚心的，虚心的人有福了，因为天国——天国——”

“天国——”

“因为天国，虚心的人有福了，因为天国是他们的。哀恸的人有福了，因为他们——他们——”

“必——”

“因为他们——呃——”

“必——”

“因为他们必——可下面我记不得了！”

“必得呗！”

“哦，必得——因为他们必得——这个——这个——必得哀恸——这个——必得——这个——他们必得哀恸，因为他们必得哀恸——这个——必得什么来着？你干吗不说出来呢，玛丽？你干吗这么小心眼？”

“我说，可怜的汤姆，你这个小笨蛋！我可没笑话你，不会的。你得再加把劲，记住它。别灰心丧气。汤姆，你准行。你要是背对了，我送你件好东西。背去吧，这才是好孩子。”

“好哩！倒是什么好东西，玛丽？告诉我，那是什么好东西？”

“你别着急，汤姆。知道吗，我说是好东西，准是好东西，错不了。”

“真的吗，玛丽？好吧，那我就再试一次。”

汤姆说罢便背了起来——在好奇心和就要到手的奖励的驱使下，卖力地背了起来，终于取得了辉煌的成绩。玛丽送了他一把“巴罗刀”3，价值十二点五美分，汤姆高兴得浑身哆嗦，立足不稳。其实，这把小刀，钝得很，切不了任何东西，但倒是货真价实的巴罗刀。拥有这么一种小刀便有一种妙不可言的气派——不过西部的小孩哪会想到：这种小刀怎么还有冒牌货，害得它的英名遭到玷污呢？这可是天大的秘密，至今还是个不解之谜。汤姆先拿碗柜试刀，后来唤他去穿衣，准备上主日学校的时候，他还在衣橱上跃跃欲试哩。

玛丽给了他一只洋铁皮水盆，一块肥皂。他出了门，把水盆放在一条小长凳上，往肥皂上蘸了点水，搁到了一边。他卷起袖子，非常小心地把水倒到了地上，然后进了厨房，拿来房门后面的毛巾，使劲地擦起了脸。但是玛丽夺过他手里的毛巾，说：

“你怎么不害臊，汤姆？你不该这么差劲，水伤害得了你吗？”

汤姆被说得有点不好意思。盆里又被盛上了水，这一次，他弯着腰面对着盆子站了好一会儿，鼓足了勇气。深深吸了口气后，开始洗起脸来。不一会儿，他紧闭双眼，进得厨房，双手去摸毛巾。肥皂水和清水滴滴答答直从脸上流下来，足以说明他是老老实实洗脸了。可一旦拿开毛巾，露出脸来，让他感到很不满意，原来只有下巴和腮帮子那一小块算是干净的，脖子四周，上上下下，前前后后一大片，黑黢黢的，像是罩上了面罩。玛丽一把拉过他，帮他洗过，这才像个大活人，像自己的兄弟，干干净净，没一丝污垢，卷曲的头发煞是匀称，一丝不乱（他亲手费劲、细心地把一缕缕鬈发捋直，抹上发油，让头发紧贴头皮，因为他觉得鬈发让人显得女里女气的，害得他的生活充满了痛苦。）。玛丽拿来另一套衣服，这衣服是近两年他上主日学校才穿的——这套衣服干脆被称之“另一套衣服”，由此可见，汤姆全部衣服就这两套。他穿戴好后，玛丽又帮他“整理了一番”，帮他把干净的紧身短袖衫的纽扣一直扣到下巴处，把那宽大的衣领翻到了肩上，掸了掸衣服，帮他戴上有斑点的草帽。这下他大为改观，只是浑身的不舒坦。看他的神情确实很不舒坦。衣服绷得紧紧的，又要保持干干净净，能舒坦得了吗？他巴望着玛丽别惦记着他的鞋子，可这希望还是落了空。她按习惯，给他的鞋子扎扎实实上了蜡后，给了他。这下可把他惹毛了，说是人家老让他干不愿干的事。可玛丽好言相劝道：

“行了，汤姆——这才是乖孩子。”

于是他穿上了鞋子，气得直吼吼。玛丽自己很快收拾好了，三个孩子动身上主日学校去了。主日学校是汤姆最不愿意去的地方，可锡德和玛丽对它情有独钟。

主日学校上课时间是九点到十点半，然后是做礼拜。两个孩子一向是自觉自愿留下来听牧师布道；另一个也愿意留下来——另有充分的原因。教堂可容纳三百号人，里面的靠背椅子高高的，没有坐垫。教堂很小，显得很寻常，有个松木板做的、类似箱子的尖屋顶。到了门口，汤姆故意放慢脚步，跟一个穿主日学校服装的伙伴打起了招呼：

“我说，比利，带上黄票子了吗？”

“带上了。”

“你愿用什么换？”

“你有什么？”

“一块甘草糖，一只鱼钩。”

“拿来看看。”

汤姆亮出自己的宝贝，都挺不错的。交易成功。接着汤姆用一对白色大弹珠换来三张红票子，又用别的小玩意儿换来两张蓝票子。此后的十到十五分钟时间内他还拦截了其他几个孩子，换来各种颜色的票子。然后跟着一群穿得干干净净、闹闹嚷嚷的男女孩子进了教室，来到自己的座位上，跟第一个来到身旁的男孩子吵了起来。一位神色严肃、上了年纪的老师过来干涉，汤姆转过身子，揪了揪坐在身旁长椅子上一位男孩的头发，没等那孩子转过脸，汤姆已装作在埋头看书了。他用大头针戳了戳另一个男孩子，好听到对方喊了声“唉哟”，结果再次惹来老师的一顿训斥。汤姆这个班的孩子都一个样，个个都很不安生，爱吵闹，惹是生非。要他们背经文，没一个能背得完整，还得不断给他们提醒，才能勉强过了关，各人都拿到一张印着一段经文的蓝色票子，作为奖赏。背完两段经文，就能拿到一张。十张蓝票子可以换一张红票子，十张红票子抵一张黄票子，十张黄票子可以从校长手中换来一本装订得很普通的《圣经》（在那种生活俭朴的年头，这样的《圣经》每本值四十美分）。哪怕为了得到一本多雷的插图本《圣经》4，我们的读者有几个愿意殚精竭虑去背诵两千段经文呢？可是玛丽就用这种方法获得过两本《圣经》，这可是她经过两年坚忍不拔的努力的收获。还有位德国血统的男孩子得到过四五本哩。有一次他一口气就背了三千段。不过，由于他用脑过度，此后几乎成了个傻瓜蛋——成了该校的一大悲哀，因为此前每遇重大场合，学校的校长便在客人面前，（用汤姆的话来说）让这孩子出来“展示一番”。只有年长的学生才会肯费心坚持枯燥乏味的背诵，拿来票子去换回一本《圣经》。所以颁发奖品便成了学校千载难逢的盛事。那些获奖的学生自然倍感风光，充满自豪。每个学生内心无不汹涌着雄心壮志，此种心情通常能延续两个星期之久。虽说汤姆的内心从未渴望过获得这种奖品，但有些日子，他无疑也希望过能得到这一殊荣以及伴随而来的光彩。

良辰一到，学校的校长便站到讲坛前，一手拿着合上的《赞美诗集》，手指夹在书页间，喝令大家肃静。主日学校的校长作简短演讲时，照例都要拿着《赞美诗集》，就像音乐会上歌手上台独唱时，手里离不开乐谱——为什么要这么做，始终是个不解之谜，君不见无论是校长还是歌手这两位遭罪者，从来不会去看《赞美诗集》和乐谱的。这位主日学校的校长细高个儿，年方三十五岁，蓄着沙色山羊胡子，沙色的短发，僵硬的立领快碰到耳朵尖了。尖尖的领角围拢过来，直逼嘴边，恰如一堵围墙，害得他只能前视，若要旁观，非得转动整个身子不可。他的下巴就托在又长又宽的领带上，而领带大小与一张钞票不相上下，两头还镶着流苏。他脚下靴子尖头高高翘起，活像雪橇的雪刀，这在当时是很流行的式样。年轻人得耐着心端坐着，一连好几小时，脚趾使劲顶着墙，才能练成这番神通。沃尔特斯先生是个办事非常认真的人，心地真诚，为人诚恳。他对圣物、圣地崇拜备至，能与世俗分得泾渭分明，不知不觉中变得在学校里说话时往往带有特殊的腔调，与平日里大相径庭。他就这样开始了自己的演说：

“我说，孩子们，我要求你们坐得端正，姿态优美，在一两分钟内，集中注意力，好生听着。好，就这样。好孩子就得这样。我发现有那么一个女孩子，她眼睛看着窗外——我想，她以为我这时候人不在这儿，跑到外面去了——也许爬到树上去给小鸟儿演讲吧（满场的窃窃笑声）。我想告诉你们，见到这么多喜气洋洋、干干净净的小脸蛋儿聚集在这儿，学做乖孩子，好孩子，我别提有多高兴了。”如此等等的话，也就用不着我多说了。全都千篇一律，毫无变化，咱们都听腻了。

此后还有三分之一的演讲受到了一帮坏孩子的打闹声和别的恶作剧所打扰，你看他们个个越来越坐立不安，唧唧喳喳，咿咿哇哇，全场混乱不堪，连锡德和玛丽这样一些为数不多、难受坏影响的坚如磐石的骨干分子，也抵挡不住诱惑。沃尔特斯先生的演说越来越有气无力，喧闹声顿时戛然而止，这场演讲就这样在无言的感激中告终。

一件罕见的事儿引起了一阵响亮的窃窃私语——来了几位客人。撒切尔律师，陪同他来的还有一位瘦弱的老人，一位很体面的、稍微发福、头发铁灰的中年绅士和一位领着一个小孩的贵夫人，她无疑是这中年人的太太。汤姆一直表现没规没矩，废话不断，牢骚满腹，心里不免有些发虚，不敢正视艾米·劳伦斯，实在受不了她那楚楚爱恋的目光。但是一见这位新来的女孩子，顿时来了劲。接下来使出浑身解数，“表演”起来。不是拍拍这个男孩子，就是揪揪人家的头发，要不就是扮起了鬼脸，一句话，使出一切招数，吸引女孩子，赢得对方的青睐。他的这一番折腾本就没有好果子吃——还记得在天使院子里所受的冷水浇头的羞辱吗？可那件事就像记录在沙中的陈迹，被眼前的阵阵幸福之浪冲刷，早已无影无踪。

几位贵宾被请上最高贵的荣誉席。沃尔特斯先生的演说一经结束，他们就被介绍给了全体师生。那位中年绅士原来是非常之人——地位绝对不比郡法官低，是孩子们见过的最威严的人物。他们想知道此人是什么材料造成的。他们既想听他的咆哮声，又怕他咆哮。他来自十二英里外的君士坦丁堡，所以说他见多识广——就是说他的这双眼睛曾观看过郡法院的屋顶——据说那可是铁皮屋顶。这种种想法激起孩子们对他的敬畏之心，会场即刻变得鸦雀无声，人人都聚精会神注视着他，就是明证。他便是大法官撒切尔，当地律师的哥哥。杰夫·撒切尔即刻迎了前去，跟这位大人物寒暄，令全校师生羡慕不已。要能听到此时台下的窃窃私语，那准如听到仙乐一样令他陶醉不已。

“瞧，吉姆！他过去了。你倒是瞧，他过去跟他握手了。他这是在握他的手哩。我说你想不想成为杰夫那样的人？”

沃尔特斯先生卖力地“表演”起来了。忙这忙那，无非是些俗套。又是发号施令，又是评头品足，又是指手画脚，只要逮到机会，就指指点点一番。图书管理员也不甘寂寞，双手满抱着书本，东跑西颠，气急败坏，尽说些只有昆虫学家高兴的事儿。那些个年轻的女教师也过来凑趣，弯腰对那些刚挨过耳光的学生一番安抚，而对那些坏小孩子则举起漂亮的手指作出警告，又亲切地拍拍其他的乖孩子，年轻的男教师又是另一番“表演”，不是小声呵责，显示自己的小尊严，便是要人家千万别忘了遵守学校的纪律。大多数老师，不分是男是女，都在教坛边的图书馆里，找到了用武之地，干起事来常常要重复两到三次（还显得急不可耐的样子）。小姑娘的“表演”也形形色色，男孩子也非常卖力，直落得纸团儿满天飞舞，混战声不绝于耳。更甚的是，那位大人物则正襟危坐，面带眼前的场面，面带大法官威严的笑意，沐浴在自己地位显赫的阳光下，暖意融融。你看他也在如此这般“表演”着。

这下沃尔特斯先生只要做好一件事就算是功德圆满了。那就是颁发一本作为奖品的《圣经》，外加展示一位奇才。有黄票子的学生不乏其人，但凑齐足够数量的没有——事先他已调查过几个明星学生。要是能让那德国小男孩神智恢复正常，让他倾家荡产也在所不惜。

可事与愿违。就在他希望落空的时候，汤姆·索亚居然拿着九张黄票子、九张红票子和十张蓝票子走上前来，要领《圣经》！这简直是晴天霹雳。哪怕是再过十年沃尔特斯先生也不会想到，这个孩子会来换《圣经》。可是你叫他怎么办？人家手里的票子货真价实，数目也对。于是汤姆被请上了台，与法官和其他贵宾坐在了一起，这事儿便成了校方传出的天大新闻。这是近十年出现的最为惊人的轰动新闻，把这位崭露头角的英雄抬高到了与法官平起平坐的高度。于是主日学校一次就能同时瞻仰不止一位，而是两位神奇的人物。男孩子个个妒忌得要命。可是最感痛心疾首的是那些孩子，他们自己无不为这可恨的荣光出过大力。他们拿自己的票子换来的东西，竟是当初汤姆出卖粉刷栅栏特权所得到的那些小玩意儿。如今悔之晚矣。这些孩子直恨自己，觉得自己上了一个诡计多端的骗子的当，仿佛被草丛中的狡诈的毒蛇咬了似的。

校长在给汤姆颁发奖品的时候表现得尽可能地热情，但到底缺乏某种真诚，因为这位可怜的先生凭直觉知道，其中必有某种见不得天日的奥秘存在。要说这孩子脑子里存着两千段之多的经文，那才叫荒唐——毫无疑问，他那能耐背十来段就够他受的了。

不过艾米·劳伦斯可是又得意又开心，她要变着法儿让汤姆看出自己脸上的兴奋劲儿。可汤姆就是不加理会，她有些想不通，然后又产生点怀疑，想通了——可又怀疑上了。她注意他的一举一动，偷偷看了一眼，真相大白——她芳心碎了，又妒又气，泪水涟涟，她恨透了所有的男孩子。她以为自己最恨的是汤姆。

汤姆被介绍给了法官。可是汤姆的舌头像是打了结，气也喘不上来，心跳加剧——部分是对方那一副威严，主要是因为他是她的父亲。要是不在光天化日之下，他简直可以暗中悄悄地给他下跪磕头了。法官的手搁到了汤姆的脑袋上，称他是个了不起的小汉子，还问他叫什么名字。这孩子喘着大气，答得结结巴巴：

“汤姆。”

“哦，不，不是汤姆，该叫——”

“托马斯。”

“哦，这就对了。我觉得也许还有呢。很好。我敢说，你还有姓没说。你能告诉我吗？”

“把自己的姓告诉这位先生吧，托马斯。”沃尔特斯先生说，“要叫‘先生’，别忘了礼貌。”

“托马斯·索亚——先生。”

“这就对了！这才是个好孩子，优秀的孩子。很优秀，像个男子汉。两千段经文不算少——很多，很多。你学会这么多经文是下了苦功夫的，可你永远不会后悔为此所花的努力。因为知识是世上最最宝贵的东西，是知识造就了伟人和好人。你日后会成为伟人和好人的，托马斯，到那时候，当你回首往事时，就会说：这全都归功于在我童年的时候，是可贵的主日学校给了我珍贵的恩赐；全归功于我的好老师，是他们教我学习；全归功于好校长，是他不断鼓励我，监督我，给了我一本漂亮的《圣经》，一本精美而典雅的《圣经》，让我拥有了它，永远不离身；全归功于对我的良好培养！到时候你就会这么说的，托马斯。你是不会拿两千段经文去换钱的——是的，你不会的。那么你能不能给我和这位女士讲点你所学到的东西？是的，我知道，你不会介意的——我们都为爱学习的孩子感到骄傲。你当然知道十二门徒的名字的。你能说说前两名门徒的名字吗？”

汤姆手拽着一只扣子，显得很是局促不安。你看他涨红着脸，耷拉下眼皮。沃尔特斯先生的心一沉。他心想，这孩子连最简单的问题也回答不了的。法官干吗要问他呢？可是他觉得自己非开口不可了：

“托马斯，回答这位先生——别害怕。”

汤姆还是犹豫不决。

“说吧，我知道你会跟我说的。”那位太太说，“前两位门徒的名字是——”

“大卫和哥利亚。”

发发慈悲吧，且把大幕拉下，这戏不必演下去了。





第五章


约莫十点半钟，小教堂那破旧的钟声响起来，于是人们纷纷聚拢了来，参加当日的晨祷。主日学校的一班学生坐在教堂内的靠背椅上，都与各自的父母一起，好受到他们的照管。波莉姨妈来了，汤姆、锡德和玛丽也跟她在一起——汤姆被安排在紧靠过道的座位上，让他远离敞开的窗子，免得他受窗外夏日景色的诱惑。熙熙攘攘的来者沿过道鱼贯而入。来人中有上了年纪的邮政局长，他现在虽然家境不济，可他是有过好日子的；有镇长和他的妻子——民众拥有一些毫无用处的玩意儿，其中也包括这位镇长；有治安官；有寡妇道格拉斯。她四十来岁，美丽、精明而乐善好施，她善良，家境也不错，她那建在山上的宅邸可算是镇上独一无二的一座富丽堂皇的宅邸。每逢圣彼得斯堡的喜庆节日，她接待起客人来热情之高，排场之阔绰无人可比，是镇上引以为豪的人物；有弯腰驼背、德高望重的沃德少校和夫人；有来自远方的名律师里弗森；随后而来的是一班镇上的大美人，跟着她们的是大群身穿细麻布衣衫、扎着绸带的令人销魂的年轻姑娘，尾随她们的是镇上所有年轻的职员——他们个个都拜倒在这些年轻姑娘的石榴裙下，如痴如醉，喜笑颜开，先是立在门廊上，嘬着手指头，把她们团团围起来，直到最后一名姑娘离开这堵“墙”，他们才进来；最后进来的是模范生威利·莫弗森，小心翼翼扶着妈妈，生怕她稍有闪失，仿佛她就是件刻花玻璃制品。他妈妈上教堂总是由他领着，他是所有妈妈眼中的骄傲。男孩子们全都不喜欢他。因为他乖得过分，此外他被“抬高得”无人能及。上主日学校的时候，他的白手绢始终从屁股裤袋里露出来——不经意间似的。汤姆可没有手绢，也瞧不起有手绢的男孩子，管他们叫势利鬼。

来听布道的人来齐了，钟声再次响起，提醒迟来的人和待在外面的人进场。随后，教堂内笼罩在一片庄严肃穆之中，只有廊台上唱诗班传来的窃窃私语声和嬉笑声打破这片寂静。整个布道期间，唱诗班始终少不了这种声响。倒是有过一个不这样没教养的唱诗班，可惜忘了我是在什么地方见过。那是很多年前的事了，具体的细节已记不清了，不过我想那准是发生在某个外国。

牧师念出圣歌的歌词，念得声情并茂，腔调甚是出众，博得这一地区民众的特别喜爱。开始时他的音调不高不低，然后慢慢地升高，到了最高的时候，恰好落在最要被强调的那个词上，然后像从跳板上纵身一跳，猛地降落下来：

他人为取胜而浴血奋战之时，

我岂能安卧绣榻被送上天堂？

他被公认是位出众的朗诵者，在教堂的“联谊会”上他常受邀朗诵诗歌。他朗诵完毕，女士们无不举起双手，然后又无可奈何地落到膝盖上，眼珠子滴溜溜地转动，摇头晃脑，像是说：“难以言表。太美了，人世间哪有这等美妙的声音！”

唱罢赞美诗，牧师斯普拉格先生自己成了块活公告牌，开始宣告种种“通知”：要开什么会啦，搞什么联谊活动啦，如此这般，没完没了，活动名单非念到世界末日决不罢休——至今在咱们美国这种古怪的做法依然大行其道，甚至在报纸发行量很大的年代，在远离我们的一些城市里，也存在这种现象。常常是：越是难以说得清的传统习俗，越难革除。

轮到牧师祷告了。祷词精彩，内容丰富，详情细节面面俱到。它为本教堂会众和他们的孩子们祈祷，为其他教堂的会众祈祷，为小镇祈祷，为这个郡祈祷，为这个州祈祷，为州官员祈祷，为合众国祈祷，为合众国的教堂祈祷，为国会祈祷，为总统祈祷，为政府官员祈祷，为在暴风雨中颠簸的可怜海员们祈祷，为欧洲在君王统治下和东方专制铁蹄下受压迫而呻吟的千万民众祈祷，为那些领受了圣灵之光和福音却见不到光明、听不到好消息的人祈祷，为远方海岛上的异教徒祈祷。最后，他祈求，他就要说出来的话语，会得到上帝的恩典和宽恕，恰如撒在肥沃土地上的种子，届时将大获丰收。阿门！

窸窸窣窣的衣服声响起，站着的会众纷纷坐下，本书所讲的这位主人公并不欣赏这一大篇祷词，他只是在忍受着——要是能忍受下去倒也罢了。整个祈祷过程中，他始终坐立不安，无意识地只听得进祷词的一鳞半爪——因为他并没有在听，不过对牧师所说的那一老套话，他都听烂了，只要祷词里掺进一丁点新鲜玩意儿，他的耳朵立刻就捕捉到，害得他立即有了反应，只感到无比的憎恨。他认为这些凭空加进去的内容完全是画蛇添足，简直是在耍无赖。祷告正做到一半，一只苍蝇落到他前座的靠背上，腿脚若无其事地一齐折腾起来，伸出爪子抱住了脑袋，使劲磨来蹭去，像是要把脑瓜子从身体上分离出去，直把那细线似的脖子暴露在眼前；又是用后腿刮擦翅膀，让翅膀能平贴在身体上，活像在摆弄件燕礼服。你看它这般从容不迫地梳妆打扮，仿佛觉得自己此刻非常安全，万无一失。事实确实如此。这场景虽然搅得汤姆心里痒痒的，可他不敢伸手去捉，他相信，在祷告时干这种事，自己的灵魂便即刻毁灭。但是随着最后一句祷词念完，他便弓起手，悄悄伸向前去，“阿门”声刚一出口，那只苍蝇立即成了他囊中物。姨妈发现他的这一举动，要他放走苍蝇。

牧师宣布了引作布道的题目，接着便喋喋不休地申明起自己的论点，既单调，又乏味，听得许多人渐渐头点地，打起瞌睡来了。他说到了人们遭受到地狱里那无穷尽的烟熏火燎之苦，而被上帝看中升入天堂的人寥寥无几，值不值得到拯救大有问题。汤姆扳着指头数了数这祷词到底有多少页。过去祈祷结束后他总能说出祷词有多长的，但其他方面却知之甚少。不过这当儿他真的来了兴趣。这时候牧师正在描绘这么一幅千禧年世界万物大团聚的辉煌而动人的场面：狮子和羊羔紧挨着躺在一起，领着它们的是个小孩。汤姆对这幅宏图所显示的慈悲之情、训示之意、道德之教无动于衷，他所感兴趣的是那个主角，他在围观民众面前是何等风光。想到这里他变得容光焕发，暗自想道：要是那是头驯服了的狮子，他很想做那个管狮子和羔羊的孩子。

枯燥乏味的布道又开始了，汤姆又受罪了。不一会儿他想到自己的一件宝贝来，便掏了出来。那是一只黑色的大甲虫，长着怕人的上下颚。他管它叫“铁钳虫”。甲虫放在装雷管的盒子里。一上来，甲虫便给了他的手指狠狠一口，汤姆本能地手指一弹，甲虫便蹦到了过道上，来了个四脚朝天。汤姆把被咬痛的手指塞进嘴里。翻倒在地的甲虫挣扎着，腿脚无助地乱蹭猛蹬。汤姆见了，很想捉它回来，可离得远，手够不着。别的对布道不感兴趣的人看着甲虫，倒也解了闷。这时候一条四处游荡的卷毛狗不紧不慢地走了过来。在这百无聊赖的夏日，它正闷得慌，显得懒洋洋的。它受够了有拘有束的日子，正想换换环境。它发现了甲虫，竖起原本耷拉着的尾巴，左右摇晃起来。它打量一阵眼前的猎物，围着它转了一圈，远远地嗅了嗅，又转了一圈，觉得没有危险，胆子壮了些，走近些，再次嗅了嗅，张开嘴，嘴唇轻轻碰了碰，可没有碰到。再来一次，又一次，挺好玩的。它干脆趴到地上，把甲虫挡在爪子中间，继续玩了起来。玩久了，玩腻了，便有点心不在焉了。它的脑袋一点点耷拉下来，下巴碰到甲虫，猛地被对方“铁钳”夹住，卷毛狗一声尖叫，脑袋一晃，甲虫被甩出两码之外，又落到四脚朝天的境地。附近那些看客看见此情景，乐得暗暗叫好，有几个还用扇子或手绢掩住脸，免得露出笑容来。可把汤姆乐极了。那狗看起来傻乎乎的，也许它是觉得自己够傻的。但它内心很是愤愤不平，决心要报仇雪恨。于是它又走向甲虫，小心翼翼地再次发动进攻。它绕着甲虫转圈儿，从不同角度扑过去，前爪离甲虫一英寸晃来闪去，要不靠近点用牙齿咬，要不摇头晃脑，晃着耳朵，再次啪啪作声。但不一会儿，它又一次感到腻了，本想换只苍蝇玩玩，可还是觉得没意思，便鼻子贴地，跟着一只蚂蚁跑，很快这也觉得乏味，便打起了呵欠，连连叹气，结果把甲虫这个茬给忘了，居然一屁股坐到甲虫身上去了。紧跟着是一声惨叫，随着一声声尖叫，卷毛狗在过道里跑了起来。跑着，叫着，卷毛狗跑过了圣坛，到了另一个房间，到了另一条过道，再穿过大门，嚷嚷着来到最后一段直道。它越跑身上越难受，最后成了一颗毛茸茸的彗星，光闪闪、亮晶晶，以光速绕着轨道飞奔。最终这发了疯的卷毛狗，离开原先的轨道，跳上了主子的大腿。可它的主子一把把它扔出窗外，狗的伤心吠声渐次变弱，最终消失在远方。

这时候，教堂里的人因为强忍着不笑出声来都憋得脸色通红，喘不过气来。布道再也进行不下去了。很快牧师又开始了布道，但他说起话来已变得有气无力，磕磕巴巴，听来布道似乎这就要告终了。就连最严肃的祝愿语，也会传来亵渎神明的哧哧笑声，那是后座的人身靠椅背强忍着而发出来的，仿佛那可怜的牧师说的是什么少见的滑稽事。这一磨难终于告终，牧师念出了赐福祈祷，大家无不如释重负。

汤姆·索亚在回家的路上兴高采烈，心想：要是做祷告的时候也这样换点新花样，倒是挺好玩的，他并不反对。只是一件事令他扫兴：让那狗与自己的大甲虫玩玩他挺乐意，可它不该带着甲虫跑了。





第六章


星期一大清早，汤姆·索亚心情很不好。每个星期一早晨他都这样，因为从这天开始一周内他天天都得困在学校里遭灾受难了。他一开始就琢磨起来：要是星期一的前一天不是星期天那该多好。不是吗，休息一天后又要回到牢房般的学校去受罪，他实在受不了。

汤姆躺在床上琢磨开来。他突然想到，要是自己害病了就好了，那就可以待在家里不去上学了。这事倒是有点可能办到。他把全身查了一遍，丝毫查不出哪儿出了毛病。他又细细查了查，这回他觉得肚子该有点痛才是。于是他满怀希望，敦促肚痛病这就发作起来，可疼痛越来越不明显，最终竟消失得无影无踪。他又继续动起了脑子。突然他有了新发现。他嘴里上排的一颗牙齿不是松动了吗？真叫走运。他准备这就哼哼起来，他管这一步叫“启动阶段”。可猛地想到，要是拿这个做不上学的借口，姨妈准要来拔他的牙齿，那有多痛。所以他觉得眼前还是保留下牙齿的好，另想别的法子。一时还想不出更妙的办法来。不一会儿，他想起曾听大夫说过一种病，病人可以在床上躺两三个星期，还要陪上一根手指。于是这孩子赶紧把那有点肿痛的脚趾从被里拉出来，捧在手里细细检查起来。可他一时还不知道这种病到底有什么症状。但不妨碰它一碰运气，于是他使劲地哼哼起来。

可锡德照睡不误，没有理睬。

汤姆哼得更响，他觉得自己的脚趾这下真的痛起来了。

锡德还是没有反应。

这一次汤姆哼得太费劲了，有点上气不接下气。他歇了歇，缓过劲来，继续哼哼起来。

锡德鼾声仍旧。

汤姆恼了。他喊起来：“锡德，锡德！”他还摇着锡德的身子。这下有了效果。汤姆又开始了哼哼。锡德打了个呵欠，伸了伸懒腰，打着喷嚏，撑起身子，两眼盯着汤姆。汤姆继续哼哼。锡德开了口：

“汤姆！我说，汤姆！”汤姆没有反应。“听着，汤姆！你这是怎么了，汤姆？”他边问边摇晃汤姆，焦急不安地盯着他的脸。

汤姆哼了哼，说：

“哦，别这样，锡德。别摇晃我。”

“这到底是怎么回事，汤姆？我这就把姨妈唤来。”

“没事，没什么事。兴许过会儿就没事了。谁也别去唤。”

“我得去！别这样哼哼了，汤姆。怪怕人的。你这样多久了？”

“几个小时了，哎哟！哦，别摇晃了，锡德。你这会要了我的命的。”

“汤姆，你怎么不早叫醒我？哦，汤姆，别哼哼，我听了身上直起鸡皮疙瘩。汤姆，到底怎么回事？”

“我会宽恕你的，锡德。”又是一声哼哼，“你对我做的事我全部会宽恕的，当我死去后——”

“哦，汤姆，你不会死的，是不是？别死，汤姆，别死，兴许——”

“我宽恕所有的人，锡德。”又是哼哼，“请你把这话告诉他们，锡德。还有，你把我的窗框和那只独眼猫送给镇上新搬来的那个小姑娘，告诉她——”

可锡德没把话听完，拎起自己的衣服跑开了。这会儿汤姆果真难受极了。他的想象力发挥得淋漓尽致，哼哼声变得像模像样起来了。

锡德跑下了楼，说：

“哦，波莉姨妈，快来！汤姆要死了！”

“要死了？”

“是的，别磨蹭了——快来！”

“胡说！我不信！”

不过她还是飞奔着上了楼，锡德和玛丽紧跟在后。她的脸色也刷白，嘴唇颤抖。她来到床前，喘着粗气，问：

“我说，你，汤姆！汤姆，你怎么啦？”

“哦，姨妈，我——”

“你这是怎么啦——这是怎么啦，孩子？”

“哦，姨妈，我的脚趾又酸又痛，染上疽痛了！”

老太太一听一屁股坐到椅子上，笑了起来。笑罢又叫喊起来。又是笑又是叫的，之后才恢复了常态，说：

“汤姆，你可把我吓坏了。你就别乱说一气了，快给我起来。”

哼哼声终于停止，脚趾也不再痛了。这孩子觉得自己有点犯傻，便说：

“波莉姨妈，我好像是得了疽痛了，痛得不得了。痛得连牙齿也顾不上了。”

“牙齿吗，牙齿怎么啦？你的牙齿怎么回事？”

“有颗牙齿松动了，痛得要命。”

“好了，好了，别再嚷嚷了。张开嘴看看。可不，果真松了一颗。不过，绝不会因为一颗牙齿就死人的。玛丽，给我拿根丝线，再到厨房去弄块火炭来。”

汤姆说：

“哦，姨妈，别，请别拔我的牙齿。它不再痛了。我想，要是牙齿再痛起来，我也不叫唤了。请别拔，姨妈。我再也不想待在家里不去上学了。”

“哦，是吗，不想了？原来你这么乱嚷嚷是因为不想上学待在家里，想去钓鱼？汤姆，汤姆，我这么疼你，可你老生着法子捣乱，伤我这老人的心。”说话间，拔牙的器具已准备停当。老太太把丝线的一头牢牢地拴在汤姆的那颗牙齿上，打了个结，另一头绑在床柱上，接着拿起火炭，猛地朝汤姆的脸上伸过去。结果那颗牙齿就吊在床柱上，摇来晃去。

不过，有苦必有得。汤姆吃过早饭上学的路上，人人都羡慕他，因为他上排的牙齿开了个缺口后，吐起痰来方式新颖，令人称奇。他吸引来一大帮小孩子，欣赏自己的表演。那个曾割破手指的孩子，刚才还有一大群人围着他转，对他崇拜不已，此刻突然没人追随，失去了往日的风光了。他感到心情沉重，虽说心里想的是一回事，嘴里还是以不屑的口气说，汤姆·索亚那飞痰的手段算得了什么？拿别的孩子话来说，这就叫作是“吃不到葡萄就说葡萄是酸的”，成了个失意的英雄，落荒而逃。

不一会儿，汤姆遇到了镇子上那个小流浪儿哈克贝利·费恩。他是镇上一个酒鬼的儿子。镇子上做母亲的无不对哈克贝利恨得要命，且远而避之，因为他成天吊儿郎当，无法无天，没教养——更因为她们的孩子都对他佩服得五体投地，虽然做妈妈的不让，可她们的孩子都乐于跟他来往，还想成为他那样的人哩。汤姆也像那些体面的孩子，羡慕哈克贝利那种逍遥自在、四处游荡的生活，可受到禁止，绝不允许跟他玩。不过只要有机会，汤姆都会跟他混在一起的。哈克贝利身上穿的都是大人们弃而不用的旧衣裤，破破烂烂，污渍斑斑，补丁飘飘。帽子又大又破，一大块月牙形的帽檐耷拉下来。身上的上衣一拖到地，背后的扣子直达屁股。裤子呢，只一根吊带吊着，裤裆低低挂下来，显得松松垮垮。裤腿要是不卷起来，裤边就会在尘土中拖来擦去。

哈克贝利爱上哪儿就上哪儿，自由自在。晴天他就睡在人家门前的台阶上，雨天就在一只空的大木桶过夜。他用不着上学，也不必去教堂，用不着称人为老师，也用不着听人使唤。他愿意去钓鱼就钓鱼，爱游泳就游泳。愿意待多久就待多久，也没人不准他跟人打架。他爱多晚睡就多晚睡。春天里是他第一个开始打赤脚，秋天，最后一个穿上鞋子的也是他。他从来不洗脸刷牙，也用不着穿干净的衣服。他说起脏话来那才叫绝。一句话，凡是让生活过得美妙的东西他无所不有。你看，圣彼得斯堡的孩子，凡是有烦恼的、受束缚的、讲规矩的，哪个不这样认为？

汤姆向这位富有传奇色彩的流浪儿打起了招呼：

“你好，哈克贝利！”

“你也好。你看这玩意儿怎么样？”

“那是啥？”

“死猫。”

“让我瞧瞧，哈克。哟，都变得硬邦邦的了。哪来的？”

“从一个小孩子那里买来的。”

“拿什么买的？”

“我给了一张蓝票子，外加一只从屠宰场搞来的猪尿泡。”

“你那蓝票子哪来的？”

“两星期前花了一只滚铁环的棒从本·罗杰斯手中换来的。”

“我说，死猫管什么用，哈克？”

“管什么用？用来治疣子呗。”

“有用吗？当真能治？我知道有更好的法子。”

“我肯定你没有。啥法子？”

“啥法子？仙水。”

“仙水？仙水屁用。”

“屁用，是吗？你用过？”

“没有。可鲍勃·唐纳用过。”

“你怎么知道他用过？”

“他告诉杰夫·撒切尔，杰夫告诉了约翰尼·贝克，约翰尼又告诉了吉姆·赫利斯，吉姆再告诉本·罗杰斯，罗杰斯告诉一个黑人，那黑人又告诉了我。这不，我就知道了。”

“我说，这又怎么样？他们全在撒谎。那个黑孩子可能除外。因为我不认识他。黑人全都会撒谎。呸！那你就说来听听，鲍勃·唐纳是怎么个治法，哈克？”

“可不是，他就是用手蘸了点烂树墩里的雨水。”

“是在大白天吗？”

“那当然。”

“是脸朝树墩的？”

“错不了。至少我估摸着是这样的。”

“他没念什么词儿？”

“我想他没念。我说不准。”

“啊哈，闹了半天用仙水治疣子就是这么个该死的蠢法子。完全不中用。你得亲自上林子里去，找到那个盛仙水的树墩子。”到了半夜三更，得背对树墩，把手伸进去，嘴里念着：

大麦，大麦，还有玉米麸子，

仙水，仙水，除掉这些疣子。

“念完了赶紧跑开，闭上眼睛，跑上十一步，然后转三个圈，这才回家，可不能对任何人说话，因为只要一开口，魔力就失灵了。”

“哦，听来倒是个好法子。可鲍勃·唐纳没这样做。”

“说对了，哥们，我准保他没这么做。因为镇子里的孩子中数他的疣子长得最多。要是他懂得用仙水的方法，那他身上就长不出一颗疣子了。我可是用这法子除掉过手上成千上万颗疣子的。哈克，我特别喜欢玩青蛙，所以身上长了不少疣子，有时候我就用豆子除疣子。”

“说对了，豆子挺不错的。我也用过。”

“你也用过？怎么个用法？”

“拿来豆子，分成两半，再把疣子割破，放点血出来，然后把血抹到一瓣豆上。到了半夜，在月亮的阴影下，找到一个十字路口，挖个坑，把抹了血的豆瓣埋掉，最后把剩下的那一半豆子烧了。你看，这颗抹了血的豆瓣不停地拉呀拉呀，想把另一半豆子拉过去，好帮助豆上的血吸疣子，这样疣子很快就被除掉了。”

“说对了，哈克——是这么回事。不过埋豆子的时候，要是念着‘豆子下土，疣子离开，不再缠我’，效果更好。乔·哈珀就这么干的。他可见过世面呢，甚至还差点去了库恩维尔这么远的地方呢。不过我说，你倒是怎样拿死猫治疣子的？”

“这个嘛，快到半夜的时候，拿着死猫，悄悄到一个坟地，找个埋恶人的地方。半夜里魔鬼就会来，来了两个或三个，可你看不见他们，只能听到风一样的声音，兴许还能听到他们说话声。魔鬼拖走那坏人的时候，你随后把猫朝他们背后扔过去，嘴里说着：‘鬼跟尸，猫跟鬼，疣子跟着死猫儿，我这就跟你们一刀两断！’这法子什么疣子都能除。”

“听来挺不错的。你试过吗，哈克？”

“没有，我是听霍普金斯老婆子说的。”

“可不是，我估摸着是这么回事，因为她是巫婆子。”

“正是。汤姆，我知道她是个巫婆。她对我爹施过巫术。是我爹亲口跟我说的。有一天，他正走着，看见她在给他施巫术，便捡起一块石子儿，要不是她躲得快，早吃石子儿了。这不，当天夜里，他喝得烂醉，从棚子里摔下来，断了一条胳膊。”

“太可怕了。他怎么知道是她施的巫术害的？”

“老天爷，我爹不会说吗？我爹说，要是有人直勾勾地瞪着你看，那准是在给你施巫术，特别是他们嘴里念念有词的时候，因为人家嘴巴叽里咕噜的时候，准是在流利地念主祷文。”

“你说，哈克，你打算什么时候用这只猫来试？”

“今晚。我估摸着，今晚那些鬼怪会来捉老霍斯·威廉斯。”

“他不是星期六就给埋了吗，哈克？魔鬼干吗不在星期六夜里就捉了他去？”

“瞧你说的！他们的巫咒不到半夜是不灵验的，再说星期六的半夜那不就是到了星期天吗？鬼怪星期天是不会出来转悠的。我估摸着不会。”

“这我可从未想到。是这么回事。能让我跟你一起去吗？”

“没说的——只要你不害怕。”

“害怕？没有的事！你会喵喵叫吗？”

“会。到时候你就回了声喵喵。上回，你让我喵喵叫个不停，害得老海斯拿石子儿砸我，还骂：‘该死的瘟猫！’我便拿砖头砸他的窗子。这事你可不能对别人说。”

“不会说的。那天夜里因为波莉姨妈紧盯着我，我才没有喵喵叫。这一回我准会叫。我说，哈克，那是啥？”

“没啥。只是一只壁虱。”

“哪来的？”

“外面的林子里。”

“可以拿什么跟你换？”

“说不准。我不想换掉它。”

“好吧。反正是只不起眼的小壁虱。”

“不是自己的东西，爱怎么糟蹋就怎么糟蹋吧。我反正是挺宝贝的。在我的眼中这可是只挺好的壁虱。”

“壁虱嘛，多的是。我想要的话，捉它千百来只准成。”

“好哇，你怎么不捉只来看看？因为你心中明白，你没那个能耐。我估摸这是只来得挺早的虱子，是最早出来的一只虱子。是我今年见到的第一只虱子。”

“我说，哈克，我就拿我的一只牙齿来换。”

“拿出来瞧瞧。”

汤姆掏出一个小纸包，小小心心解了开来。哈克贝利端详起来，显得很是喜爱。太诱人了。他终于说：

“真是你的牙齿？”

汤姆掀起自己的上唇，露出那个没了门牙的豁口。

“好吧，就这么着，”哈克贝利道，“成交。”

汤姆把壁虱放进原先用来关铁钳甲虫的牢房雷管盒子里。两个孩子各奔东西，都认为自己变得比之前更阔了。

汤姆进了学校那孤零零的小木板房，步子轻快，看那神情像是一路急着赶来似的。他把帽子挂在帽钩上，煞有介事而麻利地奔到了自己的座位。老师高高地端坐在宽大的扶手椅上，椅子的底座是薄木板做的，他在一片催人入眠的嗡嗡读书声中打着盹。汤姆进来惊醒了他。

“托马斯·索亚！”

汤姆明白，只要有人正儿八经唤他的名和姓，准要遭殃了。

“老师！”

“过来。我说，你怎么跟平时一样，又迟到了？”

汤姆正想撒谎来蒙混过关，猛见一个姑娘的背影，后面垂着两条黄色的长辫子，一股爱情的电流袭来，让他立即认出了她是哪个。他又看到，整个教室里只有那姑娘的旁边有个空位置。他立即说道：

“我刚才跟哈克贝利·费恩说了会儿话儿。”

老师几乎要停止了心跳，瞪着眼睛，显得不知所措。读书声戛然而止，学生们直纳闷，这个没脑子的孩子是不是犯傻了。老师问：

“你——你干了什么？”

“跟哈克贝利·费恩说了会儿话。”

话说得明明白白。

“汤姆·索亚，我这还是第一次听到你说大实话，真叫人吃惊。这么严重的错误不能光打手心就了事。把外衣给我脱了。”

老师使劲抽起了一束枝条，直抽得手臂酸痛，枝条纷纷折断，才住了手，然后下令道：

“给我去跟女孩子坐在一起，小子！这算是给你的一次警告。”

汤姆听了感到非常局促不安，这像是由教室里响起的一声声哧哧笑声引起的，实际上这是因为他对那位他所崇拜的陌生偶像的敬畏，以及这天赐良机而激起的极度喜悦之情的流露。他在那松木长凳的边沿坐了下来，小姑娘则挪了挪身子，脑袋偏向了一边。孩子们有捅胳膊肘的，有挤眉弄眼的，有交头接耳的，可汤姆无动于衷，胳膊肘搁在面前低矮的长课桌上，摆出了在念书的架势。

慢慢地大家不注意他了，学校里那惯常的嗡嗡读书声再次在沉闷的氛围中响起。汤姆便开始偷看起那女孩子来了。她发现后，对他做了个鬼脸，便转过脑袋，背对着他一小会儿。待她小心翼翼转过脸，发现面前摆着一只桃子。她推开了桃子，汤姆又轻轻地把桃子推过去，她又推了回来，但已不再怀有那么明显的敌意了，汤姆再次耐心地把桃子推到原处。她不再推了。汤姆在石板上潦草地写了：“请尝尝——我还有。”姑娘看了一眼石板上的字，没任何表示。汤姆又在石板上比比划划起来，左手挡着不让她看。女孩子好一会儿不加理会。好奇心人皆有之，在好奇心驱使下，她很快就流露出一些难以觉察的表示。汤姆假装没注意，继续画着画着。小女孩情不自禁，很想看看，但这男孩子就是装作没有发觉。女孩子败下阵来，迟疑地小声说：

“让我看看画些什么。”

汤姆露出画的一部分。这是一幅很不出色的漫画，一座有两面山墙的房子，烟囱冒出的一股烟歪歪扭扭，小女孩兴致勃勃，忘我地看起来。汤姆画完了，她细细看了看，小声说：

“挺不错——再画个人。”

大画家在房子的前院添了个人，直挺挺的，像架起重机，大有一步跨过院子之势。不过这女孩子并不十分挑剔，对这一怪物还挺欣赏，并小声说：

“挺漂亮的男人——把我也画上，跟着他一起。”

汤姆画了只沙漏，上面挂着一轮圆月，圆月上还有秸秆状的四肢，伸出去的手掌抓着一把古里古怪的扇子。小姑娘说：

“真漂亮——但愿我也能画。”

“挺容易的，”汤姆小声道，“我来教你。”

“哦，真的吗？什么时候？”

“中午。你要回家吃中饭？”

“要是你不回去我也待下来。”

“好——就这么着。你叫什么名字？”

“贝基·撒切尔。你呢？哦，我知道了，你叫托马斯·索亚。”

“这名字是我挨罚的时候叫的，我表现好的时候人家管我叫汤姆。你叫我汤姆吧，好不好？”

“好。”

汤姆说罢又在石板上写了起来，写些什么呢，还是不让她看。不过这次她不再像刚才那样扭扭捏捏了，她要求看看。汤姆说：

“哦，没什么好看的。”

“有好看的。”

“没有好看的，你不爱看的。”

“有好看的，我爱看，就是要看。请让我看看吧。”

“你看了会说出去的。”

“我不会说的——真的，真的，我绝对不说出去。”

“你一个字也不说出去？永远，一生一世也不说出去？”

“是的，对谁都不说。请这就让我看看吧。”

“哦，你准不爱看的！”

“你越是这样，我越要看，汤姆。”她说罢伸出小手儿，按住他的手，双方小小争夺了一番。汤姆装出认真不让看的架势，双手却一寸寸松开，最终露出三个字：“我爱你。”

“哦，你这个坏东西！”她说罢在他的手上狠狠敲了一下，脸也飞红了起来，不过她显得还是挺高兴的样子。

就在这节骨眼，汤姆只觉得耳朵慢慢地被人使劲揪了起来，身子也被渐渐提起来。他就这样被人揪着耳朵，过了教室，在满堂火辣辣的哄笑声中，被安放回自己的座位上。老师就立在他眼前，煞是恐怖，几分钟后，他才一言不发，默默地走开，回到自己的宝座。汤姆的耳朵虽说火辣辣地痛，心里却甜滋滋的。

教室里安静下来，汤姆也真心实意想好好学习了，只是内心还是闹腾得慌。到了阅读课他朗读起课文来结结巴巴，前言不搭后语。上地理课时，他把湖说成山，把山说成了河，把河说成了大陆，天翻地覆，世界又回到了混沌初开之时了。到了写字课，连小娃娃也会的“翻下”两字他拼写起来错误连连，得了个倒数第一，不得不把炫耀过好几个月的奖章交了回去。





第七章


汤姆越是想专心学习，越是走神。最后，一声叹气，一个呵欠，放下了课本。他只觉得午休的时间遥遥无期，永不再来。空气像是凝固了，纹丝不动，这是最最令人昏昏欲睡的日子。二十五名学生催人入眠的读书声恰如蜜蜂的嗡嗡声，听得人中了魔咒似的，灵魂入定了。远处，卡迪夫山在灼热的阳光下，它那柔和青翠的山坡，笼罩在沉沉的热幕之中，染上一抹远空撒下的紫色。高空有几只鸟儿懒洋洋地飞过，地上除了一些打着盹的奶牛，一无所见。汤姆急切地盼望着放学，或是干些有趣的事来打发这沉闷的时光也是好的。他把手伸进了口袋，一阵摸索，顿时满脸生辉，喜气洋洋，流露出了感恩之情。他悄悄掏出那只雷管盒子。他把盒子里的壁虱放到长课桌上。这小畜生也许当时也焕发出感恩之光，可惜高兴得太早了，就在它满怀感激之情要远走高飞之际，汤姆用一根大头针把它拨到一边，改变了它前行的方向。

跟汤姆坐在一起的是他的知心朋友，此刻，他也像汤姆那样，感到痛苦难当，一见汤姆在玩儿，他对这玩意儿也来了浓厚的兴趣，生出了感恩之情。他的这位知心朋友不是别人，正是乔·哈珀。一星期中，平日里这两个孩子是铁哥儿，到了礼拜六便两相对阵，成了死敌。乔从衣领上取下一枚大头针，帮着汤姆拨弄起这个战俘来了。两个人玩着玩着，兴趣越来越浓。不一会儿，汤姆说，这样玩法两人会互相干扰，难以尽兴。于是他把乔的石板放到课桌上，在中间自上至下画了根线。

“听好了，”汤姆说，“要是壁虱到了你那边，你可以拨它，我不去动；只要它跑到我这边来，就归我玩，它不到你那边你不能碰。”

“好哩，就这么着，动手吧。”

壁虱很快就从汤姆手下逃离开去，越过了分界线，乔玩了一会儿。它又逃开去，跑到汤姆这一边。壁虱就这样不断地来来去去。一方兴致勃勃地拨弄着壁虱，另一方同样兴致勃勃在一旁观看。石板上，两颗脑袋紧紧挨在一起，得意忘形，竟忘了世上的一切了。后来，乔交上好运了。壁虱东躲西逃，左冲右突，逗得两个孩子又兴奋，又焦急，但是一次又一次，眼看壁虱成功地从乔的大头针下逃脱，也可以说，汤姆的手这就可以触到它时，乔的大头针巧妙地把壁虱的头拨转过来，又落到自己这一边。这下汤姆不干了。他太想玩壁虱了，便伸出手，用大头针拨弄起那边的壁虱来了。乔立刻发火了，说：

“汤姆，你别动。”

“我只想拨它一小会儿，乔。”

“不行，伙计，这不公平。你不能碰。”

“得了，我又不会老玩它。”

“给我听着，别动手。”

“我不！”

“你就是不可以——它可在我这一边。”

“听好了，乔·哈珀，知道吗，这是谁家的壁虱？”

“我不管它是谁的——反正是在我这一边，你就不该碰它。”

“哼，告诉你吧，我就要碰。我的壁虱，我爱怎么着就怎么着，我死不退让！”

汤姆只觉得肩上挨了重重的一拳，乔也得到同样的报应。在短短两分钟内，两人的外衣上顿时尘土飞扬，同学们看着这场热闹，好不快活。两个孩子全力以赴，忘我地斗着，完全没注意到老师踮着脚尖，悄悄来到他们跟前，学生们跟着静了下来。老师站在一旁冷眼旁观这场精彩的表演好一会儿，然后拿出点手段，还真是锦上添花哩。

中午放学后，汤姆飞奔着找到了贝基·撒切尔，挨近她的耳朵，悄悄说道：

“戴上帽子，假装要回家，到了拐弯处，把其他同学甩掉，你自己沿着小巷绕回来。我走另一条道，同样把他们甩掉。”

于是两个人各跟着一班同学分开走了。不久两人在小巷尽头会合，一起来到学校。这时的学校可成了他俩的天下了。两个人挨着坐在一起，面前摆着石板，汤姆递给贝基一支铅笔，手把手教她画画儿，画着画着，又创造出一座惊人的房子来。慢慢地他俩对画画不再那么感兴趣了，便说起话来。汤姆陶醉在幸福的海洋之中。他问：

“你喜欢耗子吗？”

“不，我讨厌。”

“可不，我也不喜欢——活耗子。我问的是喜不喜欢死耗子。用细绳子拴着，在脑袋四周摇来晃去的死耗子。”

“不喜欢，活的、死的都不很喜欢。我就喜欢口香糖！”

“可不，我也喜欢口香糖！要是这会儿有几块就好了。”

“是吗？我有。我可以让你嚼会儿，不过得还给我。”

就这样说定了，于是两个人你嚼一口，我嚼一口，轮流着享用，两双小腿儿从凳子上耷拉下来，晃晃悠悠，其乐无穷。

“你看过马戏吗？”汤姆问。

“看过。只要我听话，我爸爸以后还要带我去看呢。”

“我看过三四次——好多次了。教堂可没马戏有意思。马戏里老有新鲜玩意儿。我长大了要去马戏团当小丑。”

“哦，是吗？太好了。小丑穿得花花绿绿，漂亮极了。”

“没错，是这样。他们都是挣大钱的主儿——一天能挣一美元。这话是本·罗杰斯说的。我说，贝基，你订过婚吗？”

“订婚是啥玩意儿？”

“订婚就是要结婚。”

“没有。”

“你愿意吗？”

“也许愿意。我说不准。到底是怎么回事？”

“怎么回事？没什么事。你只要对一个男孩子说，你要他，就要他一个，永远，永远要他，然后你就亲他。就这么回事。这事谁都会。”

“亲嘴？干吗要亲嘴？”

“干吗，你知道——大家都这么做。”

“大家？”

“可不是，闹恋爱的人都这么做。你还记得我在石板上写些什么吗？”

“记——得。”

“写了什么？”

“不告诉你。”

“要我告诉你？”

“好——吧。往后再说吧。”

“不，这会儿说。”

“不，不是这会儿——明天。”

“哦，不，就是这会儿，求求你，贝基。我悄声说出来，悄声说出来，一下子就说出来。”

贝基一时拿不定主意，可汤姆以为她不吭声就同意了，便伸手搂住她的腰，贴着她的耳朵，轻轻地道出了那句话，然后又补充了一句：

“现在你来悄悄地对我说——同样的话。”

她扭捏了一会儿，然后说：

“把脸转过去，那样你就看不见我了，然后我说。可以后你不能跟别人说了——好吗，汤姆？你不会说的，是不是，汤姆？”

“是的，不会说。你这就说吧，贝基。”

汤姆转过脸去。她羞答答地弯下身子，紧凑着他，嘴里呼出的气直吹得他的鬈发晃动起来。她悄声说了句：“我——爱——你。”

她说罢蹦了开去，绕着课桌椅转了一圈又一圈。汤姆跟着她也转着。最后贝基躲进了一个角落，用白色小围腰蒙住脸蛋儿。汤姆搂住她的脖子，恳求起来：

“行了，贝基，全成了——全成了，只差没亲嘴了。别害怕——算不了什么。求求你，贝基。”汤姆伸手去抓贝基的围腰和双手。

贝基慢慢地做出了让步，放下了手。方才一阵挣扎脸涨得通红，这时抬了起来。汤姆亲了亲那红红的嘴唇，说：

“全成了，贝基。你知道吗，从此你不能爱别的人，只能爱我一个，除了我你不能嫁别的任何人。不能，永远不能。能做到吗？”

“好的，除了你，我不爱别的任何人。汤姆，除了你，我不嫁别的任何人。除了我，你也不娶别的任何人。”

“当然，没说的。这还不算，往后上学和放学时，只要没人看见，你始终得跟我一起。舞会上你选我做舞伴，我也选你做舞伴，因为你已订了婚，该这么办。”

“太好了。这些事以前我从未听说过。”

“哦，真叫人开心！我跟艾米·劳伦斯——”

一见对方那双大眼睛瞪了起来，汤姆赶紧住了嘴，显得很尴尬。

“哦，汤姆！原来我不是你第一个订婚的人！”

贝基哭了起来。汤姆忙说：

“哦，别哭了，贝基。我心里再也没有她了。”

“不，汤姆，你心里有她——你自己明白，你心里还是有她。”

汤姆伸出手想搂她的脖子，但她推开他，把脸转向墙壁，哭个不停。汤姆又想去搂她，说几句安慰的话，又被推开了。出于自尊心，他大踏步离开了教室。他心烦意乱在外面站了一会儿，时不时打量教室的门，实指望她回心转意，出来找他。可始终不见她的影子。他心里觉得很不好受，心想这回自己是做错了。是不是得采取补救措施呢，但思前想后好一阵子，最后还是鼓起勇气，进了教室。她还站在教室后面的角落里，面对墙壁，哭哭啼啼。汤姆见状心里十分难受。他走到她跟前，立了一会儿，不知如何是好。后来吞吞吐吐地说：

“贝基，我——我，除了你，谁也不放在心里。”

听不到回答——只有哭泣声。

“贝基！”哀求声，“贝基，你就不说句话吗？”

哭得更凶了。

汤姆掏出自己看家的宝贝——壁炉架顶上拆下来的铜把手，从她背后伸到她面前，让她看，嘴里说着：

“求你拿去，好不好，贝基？”

她一巴掌把递过去的宝贝打落在地。于是汤姆大步出了教室，翻过几座山冈，走得远远的，当天再也没有回到学校。贝基呢，等了一会儿犹豫起来，跑到门口，不见汤姆的影子。她跑遍学校操场，还是没有找到他，便喊了起来：

“汤姆！回来，汤姆！”

她留心听着，听不到回应。她孤零零的，无人相陪，四周悄没声息，好不孤独。她又坐下来哭哭啼啼起来，直怪自己的不是。很快同学们纷纷回校了，她只好悄悄藏起自己的悲痛，让那颗破碎的心慢慢平静下来，身负十字架，苦苦熬过这漫长、沉闷而痛苦的下午，身边的同学形同陌路，找不到一个可以与之倾吐不幸的人。





第八章


汤姆在背街冷巷里东躲西藏，好不容易才避开那些下午来上学的同学。他闷闷不乐、磨磨蹭蹭地转悠了一阵，然后先后两三次，来到一条小溪旁，因为当时流行一种迷信的说法，认为蹚蹚水可以让人找不到自己。半小时后，他的身影消失在加迪夫山山顶上道格拉斯宅邸后面，身后坐落在远处山谷的学校显得朦胧难辨。他进了一座茂密的树林，林子里没有路径，他摸索着来到林子中央，在一株葱茏的橡树下长着苔藓的地面上坐了下来。林子里没有一丝风。鸟儿也被正午的酷热折磨得停止了歌唱。大自然进入了昏睡状态，唯有偶尔从远处传来几声啄木鸟的笃笃声，听来反而显得更加寂静，令人倍感孤独。汤姆心情忧郁凄凉，与这环境倒也非常合拍。他的胳膊放在膝盖上，手掌托着下巴，陷入了沉思。在他看来，人生不过是一场磨难，反而羡慕起去世不久的杰米·霍奇斯来了。他想，一个人长眠不醒，始终处于梦幻之中，耳听林间吹过的飒飒风声，坟头轻拂着的是绿草鲜花，没有任何烦恼和纷扰，这是何等安详的境界啊。要是他在主日学校里的评价良好，他倒心甘情愿死去，一了百了。可如今有了这个小姑娘。他冒犯了她吗？丝毫没有。他的用心是世上最最良好的，可人家像狗一样对待他——完全被看作是条狗。有朝一日她会后悔的——也许到时候后悔也来不及了。唉，要是他能这就死一小会儿该多好！

可是年少人充满活力的心一时是很难被长久压抑和制约着的，汤姆很快就开始对世间的种种俗务操起心来了。如果他就此把一切抛诸脑后，神秘失踪，那会怎么样呢？如果他远走高飞，一去不复返——漂洋过海，去异国他乡，不再回来，那又怎么样？那时她会怎么想呢？这时候他又想起了去做个小丑。这念头让他感到厌恶。一个人的精神境界一旦升华到朦胧的庄严又浪漫的境界，是与小丑的插科打诨和彩条紧身衣水火不相容的，是一种亵渎。不，他要去当兵，多年后，他历经战火洗礼从战场凯旋。不，最好还是去与印第安人一起，猎取野牛，转战在遥远西部的崇山峻岭和渺无人烟的大草原，将来，作为一名大酋长，头上羽毛飘飘，身上涂着五颜六色、令人生畏的图案，在某个慵懒的夏日早晨，闯入主日学校，发出令人魂飞魄散的战斗呐喊声，让自己的同学个个眼珠被妒火烧焦变瞎，不，还有比这更风光的。他要去做一名海盗！就这么着。现在他的前程就清晰无误地展现在他眼前，闪耀着难以想象的光辉。他的威名将传遍全球，令人闻风丧胆！他驾驶着矮而长的“风暴之神号”快船，船身漆成墨黑，船头的号旗猎猎，在波涛汹涌的大海乘风破浪。那时他何等的威风！就在他功成名就之时，突然出现在自己的老村子里，大步跨进那饱经风吹雨淋的教堂，身穿黑色丝绒紧身衣和宽松的短裤，脚蹬长筒靴，肩头披着猩红的饰带，腰带上挂着马枪，腰间的短刀是鲜血造成的猩红斑斑锈迹，阔边帽的翎毛左右摇摆。他的黑旗绘着骷髅和两根交叉的白骨，在迎风招展。人们纷纷悄声议论：“是汤姆·索亚，他是海盗——西班牙海船上的黑衣复仇者！”听得他心花怒放。

是的，就这么办，他的终身事业就此定了。他这就离家出走，踏上事业的征途。第二天一早就动身。所以现在他得开始作准备。他要把全部家当归拢一起。他来到附近的一根烂木段旁，用随身带来的巴罗小刀在木段的一端的地面挖了起来，很快就碰到一段发出空洞声的木头，便把手放了上去，煞有介事地念起了咒语：

没有来的，快来；来了的，留下！

然后他把上面的土刮去，露出一块松木瓦，拿掉木瓦，下面有一只像模像样的小宝盒，盒底和四壁是木制的，盒里放着一颗弹珠。汤姆大惊失色，他摇晃着脑袋，疑惑不解地说：

“完了，全完了！”

他恼怒之下，把弹珠子扔了出去，陷入了沉思。事实是，这是迷信，这一回不灵了。他和自己的伙伴一向认为这是非常可靠的。要是把一颗弹珠埋起来，念句必要的咒语，两星期内不去碰它，然后再念一遍刚才念过的咒语，挖开藏弹珠的地方，就会发现以前那些丢失掉的弹珠，无论丢在什么地方，都会聚集在这里。可现在看来，这办法明确无误地失灵了。汤姆的全部信念彻底土崩瓦解。以前他多次听说过这办法非常灵验，从不失手。他自己也亲自试过几次，后来连埋藏的地方也找不到。他为此反复思量过前因后果，最终认定是巫婆作怪，破了他的咒语。他觉得这事非得查个水落石出不可。于是他便四处寻找起来，终于发现一个中央塌成漏斗状的小沙堆。他趴了下去，嘴巴紧贴那漏斗，高声喊道：

小甲虫，小甲虫，把我想要知道的全告诉我！

小甲虫，小甲虫，把我想要知道的全告诉我！

沙堆动了起来，很快出现一只小甲虫，但转眼就吓得钻了进去。

“小甲虫不告诉我，可见是巫婆干的。这下真相大白了。”

他很清楚，自己斗不过巫婆，便灰心丧气地知难而退。但他觉得，该把刚才扔掉的弹珠子找回来，于是便四处耐心地寻找起来。可就是找不到。他回到那藏宝的地方，站到扔弹珠子的位置，再从口袋里掏出一颗弹珠，朝同一方向扔出去，嘴里念念有词：

“兄弟，快去找回自己的兄弟！”

他看准弹珠跌落的地点，跑过去查看。然而弹珠不是飞得偏远，就是偏近，怎么也找不到原先的珠子，于是他又试了两次，最后终于成功了。两颗弹珠相距不到一英尺。

说话间，从林子那绿色小道隐隐约约传来一阵铁皮玩具喇叭声。汤姆急忙脱下外衣和裤子，把裤背带变成了腰带，把烂木头后面的败枝腐叶扒开，露出一副粗糙的弓箭、一柄木剑和一只洋铁皮喇叭，他一把抓起这些东西，光着脚奔了开去，身上的衬衣飘飘荡荡。他很快在一株大榆树下停下脚步，吹了一声喇叭，算作是回应。接着蹑手蹑脚，警惕地四下张望，如此这般表演过后，小心翼翼地说——是对想象中的同伙说的：

“停，好伙计们！藏好了，听到我的喇叭声再出来。”

话音刚落，乔·哈珀出现了。他也像汤姆，一副轻装打扮，全副武装。汤姆喝问：

“停！不经我的许可，谁敢到舍伍德森林5里来？”

“吉斯朋6是好汉，用不着别人许可！你是哪个，竟——竟——”

“竟敢口出狂言。”汤姆提醒他说，因为他俩这是凭记忆在背书上的话。

“哪个竟敢口出狂言？”

“我！我是罗宾汉。你这个下流坯很快就知道我的厉害。”

“你果真是那个赫赫有名的无法无天之徒？我很高兴在这片好林子里与你相斗一场。看剑！”

说罢两个人各拿出木剑，扔掉各自的其他东西，摆出斗剑的架势，脚对脚，一场“两上两下”认真而谨慎的战斗开打了。不一会儿，汤姆说：

“有什么招数全使出来吧！”

于是两个人全都使出了看家本领，双方直斗得大汗淋漓，气喘吁吁。不一会儿，汤姆喝道：

“倒下！倒下！你干吗不倒下？”

“我不倒下！你自己干吗不倒下？你眼看不行了。”

“哪有的事。我不能倒。书上可没有说。书上说的是：‘接着他反手一剑刺去，结果了可怜的吉斯朋一命！’你得转过身去，让我刺中你的背。”

书上的话极富权威，乔不能不听，便顺从地转过身，接受汤姆的一剑，倒了下去。

“听着，”乔爬了起来，说，“你也得让我杀了你，这才公平。”

“这我办不到。书上可没这话。”

“你小气到家了。错不了。”

“好吧，乔，你可以做修士塔克，或磨坊主的儿子马奇，用铁头棒打我。要么我做诺丁汉郡长，你当一会儿罗宾汉，杀了我。”

这可是个两全其美的办法，于是“戏”继续演下去。后来汤姆又当起了罗宾汉，那个阴险狡诈的修女没有好好包扎他的伤口，他失血过多，奄奄一息。最后乔一人扮演了一大帮哭哭啼啼的歹徒，伤心地拖着汤姆往前走，把他的弓塞进他虚弱无力的手。汤姆说：“箭落地的地方，那株绿树下就是埋葬不幸的罗宾汉的坟墓。”他说罢射出了一箭，便倒了下去，本该这就死去，可他倒在了一丛荨麻上，嚯地跳了起来，哪像是具死尸？

两个孩子穿好了衣服，藏好了各自的“装备”，打道回府，直为如今再没有绿林好汉出没而深感惋惜，很想知道，为补偿他们的这份损失，现代文明该有什么作为。他俩说，宁愿在舍伍德森林当一年绿林好汉，也不做终身的美国总统。





第九章


当天晚上九点半，按惯例，这时候汤姆和锡德被打发去睡觉。两个人做完了祷告，锡德很快就睡着了。汤姆干躺着，焦急不安地盼着盼着。就在他觉得已快到了破晓时分，却听到时钟只敲了十响！太令他失望了。他心里憋得慌，很想翻翻身，伸伸腿脚，可又担心惊醒锡德，所以只得一动不动躺着，眼巴巴望着眼前的一片黑暗。四周的一切都静止不动，显得阴沉凄凉。后来，从这一片悄无声息中渐渐传来一些不易觉察的声响。他首先听出那是时钟的滴答声。后来又听到旧房梁发出的神秘噼啪声，楼梯也响起了吱吱嘎嘎声。显而易见，有鬼魂出没了。波莉姨妈的卧房里传出有节奏而低沉的鼾声。还有蟋蟀那令人心烦的唧唧声，再机灵的人也搞不清它是从哪里发出的。紧接着床头墙缝里传来报死蛀虫可怕的咯咯声，把汤姆吓了一跳——说明有人死期近了。后来夜空响起远处一条狗的汪汪声，更远处另一条狗也叫了起来，声音轻些，与之呼应。汤姆异常愤慨。最后他终于认定时间已停止，开始了永恒，他才心平气和下来，不知不觉打起了盹。时钟敲打十一下，但他没有听到。后来，他在半睡半醒中，听到了悲悲切切的猫叫春声。隔壁人家窗子的开启声惊动了他。紧跟着一声“滚开，你这魔鬼”的咒骂声，和砰的一声空玻璃瓶甩到波莉姨妈棚屋后墙破碎了的声音把他彻底吵醒了。片刻后他穿戴好，钻出了窗子，手脚并用爬上厢房顶上，他小心翼翼地边爬边喵喵地学着猫叫，最后跳到棚屋顶上，再跳落在地。哈克贝利·费恩拿着自己的死猫，已在那里等他了。两个孩子一起离开，身影消失在夜色之中。半小时后他俩到了墓地，钻进了高高的野草丛中。

这是一片老式西部墓地，坐落在山冈上，离村子约莫有一英里半的距离。墓地四周围着摇摇欲坠的木板栅栏，木板不是往里倒，便是向外斜，没一处是直立着的。整个墓地全淹没在野草之中。所有的老墓都已塌陷，墓碑踪影全无，插在坟头上圆顶的、被虫蛀蚀过的木牌东倒西斜，找不到支撑，快要倒下了。木牌上曾用油漆写上“某某之墓”一类的字样，即使有亮光，大多数字迹已看不清了。

一阵微风穿枝度叶，发出凄凉的飒飒声，听得汤姆心惊肉跳，只觉得那是鬼魂因清静被人搅扰而发出的抱怨声。两个孩子屏声敛息，小声交谈一两句。在这样的时刻、这样的地点，在一片庄严肃穆的氛围之中，心灵不免异常压抑。他们找到了要找的一个高高隆起的新坟堆，便在离坟头数英尺远的三株连成一片的榆树下藏了起来。

他俩默默地守候着，像是守候了很久很久。只有远处猫头鹰的叫声打破了这一片死寂。汤姆感到憋闷极了，非要说说话不可了，便小声说了起来：

“哈克，死人愿不愿意咱俩来这儿？”

哈克贝利低声答道：

“我哪里知道。这里太阴森恐怖了，是不是？”

“谁说不是。”

两个人好一会儿都没有吭声，各自想着心事。后来汤姆低声问：

“我说，哈克——你说，霍斯·威廉斯听不听得到咱俩在说话？”

“当然会听到——至少他的魂儿能听到。”

汤姆过了一会儿，又说：

“我刚才该称他威廉斯先生才是。可我没有恶意。大家都唤他霍斯的。”

“既然是死了的人，怎么称呼他们就不要太讲究了，汤姆。”

话不投机，再也没有说下去了。不久汤姆揪住对方的胳膊，嘘了一声。

“怎么回事，汤姆？”两个人紧紧挨在一起，心头怦怦直跳。

“嘘！又来了。你没听见？”

“我——”

“可不是！现在听到了吧。”

“老天，汤姆，鬼怪可来了！他们当真来了！咱们怎么办？”

“不知道。你说他们能不能看见咱们？”

“哦，汤姆，他们像猫一样在黑暗中也能看清东西。我要是不来这里就好了。”

“哦，别害怕。我相信他们不会找咱们麻烦的，咱们又没有招惹他们。要是咱们静静待着，他们兴许不会发现咱们的。”

“我尽量不动就是，汤姆，可老天爷，我浑身在哆嗦呢。”

“听！”

两个孩子低下了头，紧紧挨在一起，大气也不敢出。远处的墓地尽头传来一声一个人压低了声音。

“瞧，瞧那边！”汤姆低声说，“怎么回事？”

“是鬼火。噢，汤姆，太可怕了。”

黑暗中过来几个模模糊糊的人影，一只老式的洋铁皮手提灯晃来晃去，把无数闪闪烁烁的光点投到了地面上。不一会儿哈克贝利打了个寒战，低声说：

“肯定是鬼魂。是不是三个？老天爷，汤姆！咱们没命了。你会不会祷告？”

“我试试，你别怕。他们不会伤害咱们的。‘我已躺下睡了，我——’”

“嘘！”

“怎么回事，哈克？”

“他们是人！至少其中有个是人。是老穆夫·波特的声音。”

“不对，不是的，是吗？”

“我敢肯定，这声音我熟悉。你别乱动。他可没那么机灵发现得了咱俩。看起来又喝得醉醺醺的了——这该死的老东西！”

“好吧，我不乱动。瞧他们这会儿站住了。没有找到地方。他们又过来了。争吵起来了。不争了，又争吵起来了。争得可凶哩！这回算是找准方向了。听我说，哈克，我听出另一个人是谁了，是印第安人乔。”

“是他，这个杀人成性的混血儿。就是遇见鬼也比碰到他们强。他们来这儿干吗？”

他们不再嘀咕了，因为那三个人已来到那个坟头，离这两个孩子藏身的地方只有几英尺。

“就是这里。”说话的是第三人，他高举着提灯，照亮了一张年轻的脸——原来是罗宾森医生。

波特和印第安人乔推着一辆手推车，车上放着一根绳子，两把铁锹。他们把车里的东西拿下来后，动手掘起了坟墓。医生把提灯放到坟头上，过来背靠一株橡树坐了下来。两个孩子离他很近很近，伸手就可以碰到他。

“加把劲，伙计！”医生低声道，“月亮随时都会出来。”

另两个人嘟哝了一声算是回答，继续干下去。一时间只听到铁锹挖土和沙石发出的声音，十分刺耳。最后，铁锹碰到棺材，响起一声沉闷的木头声，不到一两分钟，那两个人便把棺材拉了上来。他们用铁锹撬开棺盖，抬出尸体，粗暴地扔到了地上。月亮已从云层后面钻出来了，月光照亮了死者惨白的面孔。手推车推了过来，尸体被放了上去，盖上一条毯子，用绳子捆紧。波特掏出弹簧刀，把挂在车外的一截绳子割掉，说：

“这下该死的事儿全办妥了。大夫，你得再掏五块钱，要不就让它搁在这儿得了。”

“是这话儿！”印第安人乔说。

“听着，你这是什么意思？”医生说，“价钱早就讲好的，再说你们也收了。”

“可不是，你是付了钱，可还有呢，”印第安人乔走到站着不动的医生跟前，说，“五年前，一天夜里，我来到你家的厨房，想要口饭吃，可你爹把我撵了出去，还说我没安好心。我发誓说，哪怕过了一千年，我也要出这口恶气，你爹便把我说成无赖投进班房。这事你以为我忘了？我身上流的可是印第安人的血。放明白点，这会儿你落到了我的手中，我是不会放过你的！”

他说罢攥紧拳头在医生跟前比划起来，可医生猛地挥出一拳，把这无赖打翻在地，波特扔下刀，嚷了起来：

“好哇你，竟敢打我的兄弟！”话音一落，他与医生扭在了一起，两个人使出吃奶的气力斗在了一起，直斗得脚下野草被踩倒，尘土翻滚。印第安人乔也跳将起来，眼冒怒火，捡起波特的刀，像只猫，在两个搏斗在一起的人周围打转，寻找机会下手。冷不防医生挣脱出来，抡起威廉斯坟上那沉重的木牌，把波特打翻在地。与此同时，那个混血儿看准机会，拿刀捅进年轻医生的胸口，只留下一截刀柄在外。医生晃晃悠悠，倒了下去，半个身子压在波特身上，溅得波特满身是血。这时候过来一片乌云，遮住了这一惨相。黑暗中，两个小孩子吓得拔腿就跑。

很快月亮再次露出来，只见印第安人乔站在两个人跟前，打量他们。医生嘴里嘟嘟哝哝，不知说些什么，长长喘了一两口气，再也没了声息。混血儿咕噜道：

“这笔账从此两清了——你这该死的。”

他接着搜走尸体身上的东西，又把杀人的凶器放进波特张开的右手中，然后在那具被撬开的棺材上坐了下来。过了三——四——五分钟，波特开始动弹起来，发出了呻吟声。他握紧手中的刀，举起来一看，一阵哆嗦，撒开了手。他赶忙坐起来，推开尸体，打量了一番，又茫然地看了看四周。他的目光与乔相遇。

“老天爷，怎么回事，乔？”他问。

“糟糕透了，”乔没有动弹，说，“你干吗这么干？”

“我？我可没干。”

“听着，你可不能一推了事。”

波特一听吓得浑身哆嗦，脸色发白。

“我还以为自己喝糊涂了呢。今晚我真不该喝酒。瞧我脑子里还留着酒——比刚才动身时还要糟。满脑子搅得像锅粥，怎么也想不起是怎么回事。跟我说说，乔——掏心窝子说，老伙计，是我干的吗，乔？我压根儿就没存这个心。我发誓，我压根儿就没存这个心。告诉我，到底是怎么回事，乔。哦，太可怕了——瞧他多年轻有为的一个人。”

“这不，你俩扭打在一起，他抄起木牌打了你，把你打翻在地，后来你爬起来，跌跌撞撞，晃晃悠悠，就在他再次想狠命揍你时，你拿起刀子直捅了他，你也跟着倒了下去，像根木桩子一动不动躺着，这会儿才醒过来。”

“哦，到底干了些什么，连我自己也闹不明白。要是知道自己干了什么，倒不如死了的好。全怪喝了威士忌，失去了理智。我虽然跟人打过架，可这一辈子压根儿就没动过刀子。大伙儿都会这么说的。乔，你可别说出去！你就答应吧。这才是我的好哥儿们。我一向喜欢你，乔，也一向护着你。你没忘吧？你不会说出去的，是不是，乔？”这可怜的家伙说罢在显得若无其事的杀人凶手面前跪了下去，双手合十，哀求起来。

“是的，你对我一向很公正，十分关照我，穆夫·波特。我不会对不起你的。好了，一个男子汉能说的就这些。”

“哦，乔，你是天使，下半辈子我忘不了你的大恩大德。”波特说罢咿咿呀呀哭了起来。

“得了，别这样。现在不是抹泪的时候。你那头，我这头，咱们分头走掉。这就走吧，千万别留下把柄。”

波特拔腿就跑，跑得越来越快，直奔了起来。那混血儿站着没挪窝，看着对方离去。他嘀咕道：

“看样子他真的被打糊涂了，也被黄汤灌得晕头转向了。他就没有想到刀子，等到想到，人已经跑远了，再说他也不敢回到这儿来取——好个胆小鬼。”

两三分钟后，除了那一轮明月，再也无人注意这被杀之人、这裹着毯子的死尸、这撬掉盖子的棺材和这挖开的坟墓。

四周复又被死寂所笼罩。





第十章


两个孩子被吓得说不出话来，直向镇子飞快奔去。一路上他俩时不时战战兢兢扭过头去看看，像是生怕有人跟踪过来。路上的每个树墩子，都像是埋伏着人，埋伏着敌人，他俩被吓得喘不过气来。两个孩子跑过村边的几家农舍时，惊起看门狗声声吠叫，害得他们身上像长了翅膀，更快地飞奔起来。

“要是能跑到旧鞣皮厂，自己还没倒下去，那就谢天谢地了！”汤姆上气不接下气，低声道，“我可是撑不了多久了。”

哈克贝利只顾得喘气，哪有搭腔的份儿。两个孩子眼睛盯着那个目标，使出吃奶的力气奔过去。目标越来越近，两个人终于肩挨着肩，冲进了洞开着的大门，又惊又喜，怀着感恩之心，筋疲力尽地瘫倒在掩护他们的阴影里。他们的心跳慢慢地平稳下来，汤姆这才低声开了口：

“哈克贝利，你看这事儿会有什么结果？”

“要是罗宾森医生死了，免不了有人要上绞架。”

“是这样吗？”

“可不是，我有数，汤姆。”

汤姆想了一会儿后，说：

“谁去告发？咱俩？”

“瞧你说的！要是事发后，印第安人乔没被绞死，他迟早会宰了咱俩。咱俩算是死定了。”

“我也是这么想的，哈克。”

“要说有人出来告发，那只有穆夫·波特了，还要看他够不够傻。他可是个酒糊涂。”

汤姆没有搭腔，径自琢磨起来。过了一会儿，他悄声问道：

“哈克，穆夫·波特压根不知情，他怎么个告发？”

“凭什么说他不知情？”

“因为印第安人乔干的时候，他挨了人家狠揍。这事儿你以为他能看到？你以为他清楚？”

“哎呀，可不是吗，汤姆！”

“再说，你看——挨了那一下，兴许他也没命了！”

“不，不会的，汤姆。他只是喝多了。我看得出来。再说，他一向这个样子。我爹喝饱了，就是搬来一座教堂当头砸下去，也别想让他回过神来。他自己就是这么说的。穆夫·波特当然也一个样。不过我看要是遇到没喝酒、完全清醒的人，挨了那一下准没命。是不是这样我说不准。”

汤姆默默地想了一会儿，说：

“哈克，你当真会不吭声？”

“汤姆，咱俩能吭声吗？你是知道的。要是事发了，那个印第安魔鬼不被绞死，他准会像淹死两只猫那样，轻松淹死咱俩。听我说，汤姆，咱俩这就发个誓——非得发个永不吭声的誓不可。”

“我同意。哈克，这是最好的办法。你把手举起来，发誓说咱们——”

“哦，不，这还不够。对付日常生活中那些鸡毛蒜皮的小事，这样发发誓能凑合着——特别是对付小丫头挺有用，因为她们往往说话不算数，发起火来什么都会给你端出去——眼下这种大事儿，得写下来，得立下血书。”

汤姆对这个主意一千个赞成，一万个同意。这想法多深奥，多严肃，多令人恐怖。这时刻，这环境，这地点多适合起这样的誓。汤姆在月色下，捡来一块干净的松木瓦，又从口袋里掏出一截“红赭石”，就着月光，歪歪扭扭写了起来，一笔一画都挺费劲，向下划时，得咬着牙关，慢慢地，重重地移动；向上划时，下手很轻：

哈克贝利·费恩和汤姆·索亚发誓：

这事永不吭一声。要是有人说出去，

立刻倒地死去。

在哈克贝利看来，汤姆写字本领高强，用词高雅，他佩服得五体投地。他立刻从翻领上取下一根大头针，就要去扎肉，汤姆说：

“别忙！动不得。大头针是铜的，上面可能有铜绿。”

“啥铜绿？”

“一种有毒的东西。问题就在这儿。只要吞一下丁点，就知道它多厉害了。”

于是汤姆摘下身上一根针，解下针上的线。两个小孩各自在大拇指上刺出一滴血。经多次挤压，汤姆以小指作笔，好不容易签下了自己姓名的第一个字母。然后他教哈克贝利如何写“哈克贝利·费恩”的第一个字母H和F，誓言算是写完了。经一番庄重的仪式和咒语后，他俩把松木瓦埋在墙根下。如此一来，他们认定，他们的舌头就上了锁，开这锁的钥匙也扔掉了。

这时候，一个黑影从这座破破烂烂的房子的另一头偷偷摸摸过来，可他俩没有发现。

“汤姆，”哈克贝利悄声说，“起了誓就能挡住咱们不再说出去吗——永远不说出去？”

“当然能。无论发生什么事，都有效，都能保证不会说出去。一旦说出去，就当场倒地没命——你记得吧？”

“记得，我想是这样。”

两个人又悄悄说了一小会儿话。不久，外面传来一阵长长的狗的哀号声——就在离他俩十英尺的地方。两个孩子吓得不轻，不由紧紧抱在一起。

“它是冲着你我哪一个来的？”哈克贝利喘着粗气问。

“说不准。从门缝往外瞧瞧。快！”

“不行，还是你去，汤姆！”

“我不行——我不行，哈克！”

“求你了，汤姆。狗又叫了！”

“哦，老天爷，谢天谢地！”汤姆低声说，“我听出来了。这是布尔·哈比森7在叫。”

“太好了——告诉你吧，汤姆，可把我吓死了。我敢打赌，这是条野狗。”

那狗又吠了起来。两个孩子的心再次一沉。

“啊，天哪！这可不是布尔·哈比森，”哈克贝利悄声说，“看看去，汤姆！”

汤姆吓得浑身哆嗦，但还是去了。他一只眼睛贴在门缝上看了起来，接着便说，声音低得几乎听不清：

“哦，哈克，这是条野狗！”

“快，汤姆，快！看看它是冲哪个来的？”

“哈克，准是冲咱两个来的——咱俩不是一起的吗？”

“哦，汤姆，这下咱俩准完蛋了。我知道自己会落啥下场。错不了。我这人实在太坏了。”

“这是自作自受。谁叫我逃学，尽干些大人不让干的事来着？要是我乐意做个像锡德那样的好孩子，我能办到——可我不乐意。要是我能躲过这场灾祸，我发誓，往后在主日学校一定学乖守规矩。”汤姆说罢抽起了鼻子。

“你还坏！”哈克贝利也抽起了鼻子，“得了吧，汤姆·索亚，跟我比起来，你便是‘圣人’了。哦，老天爷，老天爷，老天爷，我只要有你的一半运气就知足了。”

汤姆不再抽泣，低声说：

“看哪，哈克，看哪！它背对着咱们哩！”

哈克一看，不由心花怒放。

“老天，果然背对着咱们！刚才是不是这样？”

“可不是，就是这样的。我怎么像个傻瓜，就没想到。知道吗，好事儿。可它冲着谁叫呢？”

狗不叫了。汤姆仔细听了起来。

“嘘！怎么回事？”他低声道。

“听声音像是——像是猪的呼噜声。不对——是有人在打鼾，汤姆。”

“说对了。哪里呢，哈克？”

“我想是在另一头。反正听声音是在那里。我爹有时候就跟猪睡在一起，老天爷，他打起呼噜来能掀翻房子。我估摸着，他再也不会回到镇子上来了。”

汤姆心里又冒出冒险的念头。

“哈克，要是我领头，你敢不敢跟我去？”

“不想去，不太想。要是遇到印第安人乔就糟了！”

汤姆听了身子哆嗦了一下，但还是挡不住诱惑。两个孩子同意一试，讲定，只要那呼噜声一停，就跑过去一看究竟。于是两个孩子蹑手蹑脚，一前一后，悄悄走了过去。当他俩来到离那打呼噜的人五步的地方，汤姆一脚踩到一根树枝上，发出咔嚓一声，那人哼了哼，扭动起身子，月光下露出了他的脸孔。原来他是穆夫·波特。两个孩子一见他挪动起来，心几乎停止了跳动，以为这下没活命的指望了。但很快便忘了害怕，踮起脚尖，越过那断裂的风雨板，走了没多远，两个人就分手了。夜空中再次响起长长而恐怖的狗吠声。他俩转身一看，那条陌生的狗就立在离波特躺着数英尺的地方，面对波特，鼻子朝天。

“哦，老天爷，原来是冲着他的！”两个孩子齐声惊呼道。

“汤姆，有人说，两星期前的一个晚上，半夜三更，有条野狗绕着约翰尼·米勒家吠个不停。还飞来一只夜鹰，落在他家的阳台上，不断叫唤。可至今他家还没死过人呢。”

“这事我知道。就算他家没死过人，可格雷西·米勒在一周后的星期六不是跌进了厨房的火里，烧了个半死吗？”

“不错。可她没死。再说，后来她也慢慢好起来了。”

“得了，你等着瞧吧。她迟早也会像穆夫·波特一样，没好结果的。那班黑人都这么说。他们对这档子事可清楚哩，哈克。”

接着两个孩子分了手，可对这事心里还是念念不忘。汤姆悄悄地从窗子里爬进自己的卧房，这时天差不多快要亮了。他非常小心地脱掉衣服，睡了，暗自庆幸他这次外出没被人发觉。可他不知道，别看锡德在低声打着呼噜，其实他早在一小时前就醒了。

汤姆醒来时，锡德已穿好衣服，出去了。一看天色，再看气氛，就知道天已不早了。他吓了一跳。他们怎么不唤醒他呢——像平日那样，非折磨得他醒来不可呢？想到这里他感到大事不好。他花了五分钟便穿好了衣服，下了楼，浑身酸痛，打不起精神来。全家人还围在餐桌前，但已吃过早餐。没人说一句责备他的话，谁也不瞧他一眼。屋子里一片寂静，气氛严肃，看得这个逃犯直冒冷汗。他坐了下来，装出快快活活的样子，可这只是白费劲。没一个人冲他笑，没人理睬他，他只好闷声不响，一颗心坠入了深渊。

早饭后姨妈把他领到了一边，汤姆以为这要挨揍了，他反而感到高兴。但事实并非如此。姨妈对着他哭哭啼啼，反问他怎么这样狠心伤她这颗年迈的心，最后请他继续胡闹下去，毁了自己，好让她这个白发苍苍的人痛苦地早进坟墓，因为她对他已无计可施了。这情景比被鞭打一千次还要糟。他的心比肉体还要酸楚。他痛哭流涕，百般求饶，一次又一次保证会改过自新，这才让姨妈放过了他。但觉得结果是姨妈并没有完全宽恕他，对他的信誓旦旦也只是半信半疑。

他离开姨妈的时候可说是伤心断肠，连对锡德报仇的心也没有了。所以锡德居然从大门出逃其实也是多此一举。汤姆一副没精打采、伤心痛苦的神情，慢吞吞地去上学，因为头天和乔·哈珀由于逃学挨过鞭子。不过看他那架势，他仿佛早已经历过比这更严重的痛苦，对这类区区小事才不放在心里呢。他在自己的座位上坐了下来，胳膊肘支在桌上，双手托着下巴，眼瞪着墙壁，那呆呆的神情表明，他的痛苦早已无以复加了。他的一只胳膊压着一件硬东西。过了很久他才伤心地调整了一下姿势，叹了口气，拿起那压着的东西。那是一个纸包，他打了开来，随着是一声长长的、深深的叹息，他伤心欲绝。里面包着的是他的铜把手！

这完全应了一句老话：“一根羽毛压垮了骆驼背。”





第十一章


快到正午，可怕的消息电流般流遍整个镇子，用不着电报帮忙——当时人们做梦也梦不到电报机。这消息你传我，我传你，很快就家喻户晓，速度之快不亚于如今的电报。为此，校长自然下午给孩子放了假，不然的话镇子里的人会说他的怪话。

被害者的身旁发现了一把血迹斑斑的刀，有人认出那是穆夫·波特的刀——传言就这般流传开来。有人说，一位夜归的当地居民在深夜一两点钟的时候遇见过波特在小河沟里洗澡，波特一见来人拔腿就跑——这事大可怀疑，特别是波特这家伙，向来是没有洗澡的习惯。也有人说，为了找寻“凶手”，已把全镇搜了个遍（对于调查取证，量刑定罪之类的事公众无不争先恐后，议论纷纷），可就是找不到他这人。大路小道上，骑警已四面八方前堵后截，治安官蛮有把握断定，不到晚上就可将他捉拿归案。

全镇的人纷纷涌向坟地，汤姆顾不得自己的伤心事，也加入这一行列，这倒不是因为他有千百条理由不去那里，而是因为有股可怕而难以估量的魔力吸引着他非去不可。一到那恐怖的地方，他那瘦小的身子便钻进人群，看到那悲惨的场景。他只觉得自己是前世到过这里的。他的胳膊被人捏了一下，回头一看，原来是哈克贝利，两双目光对视片刻，立即转移到了别处，担心被人发觉。但是大家忙着你言我语，注意力全集中在眼前可怕的场面上。

“可怜的人儿！”“可怜的年轻人！”“这对那些个盗墓贼应该是个教训！”“只要找得到，穆夫·波特该为此被吊死！”——如此这般，人们议论纷纷。牧师说：“这是报应。上帝无处不在。”

汤姆一见到若无其事的印第安人乔，从头到脚浑身哆嗦。就在这时候人群骚动起来，挤挤挨挨，有人在高声喊叫：“是他！是他！他自己送上门来了！”

“谁？谁？”问话的有二十人之多。

“穆夫·波特！”

“喂，拦住他！别让他跑了！”

汤姆头顶的树枝上有些人说，他不会逃的——他只是显得惶恐不安，疑疑惑惑。

“一个世上少有的不要脸的家伙！”说话的是位旁观者，“自己过来，见了自己干的好事还没事似的——没有想到会遇见这么多人。”

人群让开了一条道，让治安官拉着波特的一只胳膊，威风凛凛地走了过去。这可怜的人儿显得面容憔悴，神色恐惧。当他面对被害者时，浑身哆嗦，双手掩面，啼啼哭哭起来。

“不是我干的，朋友们，”他哭诉道，“我发誓，用名誉担保，我没干。”

“是谁告发了你？”有人大声问。

这话问得好，击中了要害。波特抬起头，朝四周看了起来，眼里流露出的是哀怨和绝望的神色。他看见了印第安人乔，高声道：

“哦，印第安人乔，你答应过绝不——”

“这刀是你的吗？”治安官把刀扔在了他的面前。

要不是有人扶着，让他坐下去，波特很可能这就要瘫倒在地了。他接着说：

“我就想到过，要是不回来拿——”说到这里他哆嗦了一下，神经质地挥了挥手，一副没奈何的架势，接着说，“告诉他们，乔，告诉他们——瞒也没用。”

哈克贝利和汤姆目瞪口呆，听着这铁石心肠的骗子若无其事地说出一大篇谎话，实指望上帝这就显灵，来个晴天霹雳，打到他的脑袋上，直纳闷这天雷怎么迟迟不下来。可印第安人乔说完了，竟还是好好的，毛发无损。眼看着冲动之下，他俩这就要违背自己的誓言，去拯救那个蒙冤受屈的可怜“囚徒”一命，但这愿望最终还是消退，化为乌有。因为显而易见，这个无赖已把自己出卖给了魔鬼撒旦。去管有那么强靠山的人的闲事，恐怕不会有好下场的。

“你为什么不逃走？你回来为的是哪般？”有人问。

“我这是不由自主——不由自主，”波特呜咽道，“我想过跑掉，可除了这儿，哪里也去不了似的。”说罢他又哭哭啼啼起来。

数分钟后，验尸的时候，印第安人乔又信誓旦旦若无其事地把说过的话复述了一遍。两个孩子一见天雷不见动静，更相信他确实已把自己的灵魂出卖给了魔鬼了。在他俩的心目中，他已成了前所未见的最歹毒而引人关注的对象了，所以一直就目不转睛地注视着他那张脸。他俩暗下决心，夜里，只要逮到机会，就监视他，希望能一见他那可怕的主子嘴脸。

印第安人乔帮着把被害者抬上大车运走。被吓得哆哆嗦嗦的人群中有人低声说，刀口处流出一点血。两个孩子认为，这是个喜人的情况，这可以把怀疑的对象转到正确的方向。但是叫他俩大失所望，因为不止一人指出：

“刀口滴血的时候，穆夫·波特离尸体只有三英尺。”

此后的一星期，汤姆被这可怕的秘密和自己的良心折磨得睡不好觉，有一天早晨吃早饭的时候，锡德说：

“汤姆，你睡觉的时候老翻来覆去，还讲梦话，害得我有一半时间没睡好。”

汤姆的脸变得苍白，他垂下了眼皮子。

“这可是个不好的信号。”波莉姨妈严肃地说，“你满脑子都想些什么，汤姆？”

“什么也没有，我什么也不知道。”可这孩子说着说着，手在哆嗦，把杯子里的咖啡也泼了出来。

“可你尽说胡话。”锡德说，“昨天夜里你说：‘血！血！就是血！’这话你说了一遍又一遍。你还说：‘别这么折磨我——我说。’说什么？到底想说什么？”

事事都在汤姆眼前晃动。实难料定会出现什么情况。幸好波莉姨妈关切的神情逐渐消散，她没有了解到真相，让汤姆舒了口气。她说：

“哟！这可是件可怕的谋杀案，害得我每晚都做噩梦。有时候我还梦到这事是我干的呢。”

玛丽说她也受到同样的影响。锡德似乎也消除了疑虑。汤姆赶紧逃离了现场。此后的一星期汤姆说自己牙痛，天天晚上硬是把下巴用绷带包扎起来。他并不知道，晚上锡德都在监视他，常常解下他下巴的绷带，然后用手支撑着身子，听了好一阵子，再把绷带扎回去。汤姆的心病渐渐治愈，可牙痛病却日见加剧，干脆不用装了。即使锡德从汤姆的那些语无伦次的胡言乱语中听出了什么，他也放在心里，不外传的。

汤姆觉得他的那些同学不断玩给死猫验尸的游戏，没完没了，害得他老想起那件惨事，令他烦恼不堪。锡德发现，汤姆以前玩新花样的时候事事踊跃争先，可如今玩给猫验尸的游戏时，他从来不来当验尸官，他也发现，汤姆甚至连看也不愿看一眼——你说这有多怪。所以锡德没有忽视这么一个事实：汤姆对验尸表现出了强烈的厌恶，尽可能避而远之。锡德想不通，可没有说出来。好在后来同学们不再热衷于给猫验尸的游戏了，从此汤姆的良心也少了折磨。

在这痛苦的日子里，汤姆每一两天都会瞅住机会，跑到装了铁格栅的牢房小窗前，偷偷塞给“杀人犯”一些力所能及的小小“慰问品”。这牢房就在镇子边洼地上一个砖砌的不显眼的小地窖里。没有人守护，很少关过人。汤姆赠送这些小物品有助于减轻自己良心的不安。

镇子里的居民很想给印第安人乔身上涂上柏油，粘上羽毛，用一根棍子抬着他游街示众，作为对他盗墓行为的处罚。只是他生性凶狠，没人敢出来挑头，这事就搁下来了。他在受到调查时两次陈述中都谨慎地说到打架的事，盗墓一节只字未提，所以都认为，最明智的做法是目前且把这一案子搁一搁，暂时不去审理。





第十二章


汤姆内心的烦恼被搁在一边，原因之一是他已发现了一件新鲜而重大的事，引起了他的关注：贝基·撒切尔不来上学了。汤姆同自己的自尊心斗争了好几天，想把她彻底抛到脑后去，可还是以失败告终。连续好几个晚上，他在她父亲房子周围转悠，好不伤心。她病了。要是她一命呜呼，该怎么办？想到这里让他痛苦不堪。他对打仗已失去兴趣，也不想当海盗了。生活已没了魅力，感到的唯有索然无趣。他把铁环和球棒抛到了一边，提不起玩的兴趣。姨妈不禁担心起来，想方设法拿种种药物来治他的病。她属于这样一类人，最信得过享有专利的药品和新奇的保健和治病的疗法。在这方面她堪称是名坚持不懈的实验者。一旦有什么新花样出现，她就会狂热地去试验一番，只是不在自己身上试，因为她从来不害病，而是拿身边的人作试验品。她订阅种种“健康”杂志和骗人的看相书，里面的骗人鬼话成了她的生活指南，诸如如何让空气流通啦，如何睡眠啦，吃什么啦，喝什么啦，需要多大的运动量啦，该保持什么样的心情啦，穿什么衣服啦——凡此种种无不成了她的金玉良言，可她就是没有注意到当月的健康杂志所刊登的内容与上一期所鼓吹的背道而驰。她头脑简单，心地善良，所以容易上当受骗，她珍藏自己那些骗人的健康杂志和药品，无异请来了死神，打个比方来说，她这是骑在灰色的马上，四处游走，“地狱紧随其后”8。可是她压根就没有想到，对那些病痛缠身的左邻右舍来说，她不是治病救人的天使，也不是变了身的基列的镇痛膏9。

水疗法是新近流行的疗法，汤姆这种萎靡不振的精神状态正好让他成了她的试验品，得来毫不费工夫。每天早晨她都催他起床，到小木棚去，给他一阵冷水浇头，再拿毛巾使劲从头到脚擦遍全身，就像用锉锉他一通，让他振作起来。然后用条湿床单将他裹起来，压上几条毯子，让他出一身汗，从而心灵就一尘不染，干干净净，按汤姆的说法，那样“灵魂里黄色的脏东西就从毛孔被撵出来了”。

可是这孩子被这般折腾之后，神情反而更加萎靡不振，面色更加苍白，意志更加消沉。于是她又给他添上热水浴、坐浴、淋浴、浸浴等诸多名目，可这孩子还是死气沉沉，活像辆柩车一个样。于是她采取进一步的措施，除水疗外，辅以稀燕麦粥，再加发泡膏。她拿他当成了药罐，容量不小，天天尽拿种种万灵药往他肚子里塞。

汤姆对姨妈的这种种折磨已无动于衷。其间老太太也心存恐惧，非不惜代价改变他的这种精神状态不可。这时候她第一次听说有一种止痛药很灵，一口气就买了一大堆。她亲口尝了尝，只觉得是天赐的神丹妙药。这简直是液态的火。于是她不再用水疗法和其他的种种疗法，希望全寄托在这止痛药上。他让汤姆服下一汤勺，急不可耐地等着会出现什么样的神效。她的忧虑立即冰消，灵魂再次得到了安宁。因为汤姆的“萎靡不振”已破解了。哪怕在汤姆身下生起一堆火，他也不会显得这般野性十足，兴致勃勃。

汤姆觉得，自己该清醒过来了。这种精神状态下的生活固然够新奇的，可就是缺乏刺激，单调乏味，太没情趣。所以他盘算着找些轻松的事来，最终想到了假装喜欢止痛药这一招。他老向她要止痛药，害得姨妈不胜其扰，最后干脆让他自己去拿，好落个清净。换了锡德，她乐于让他自行其是，可汤姆到底叫她不放心，不免暗暗留神起药瓶里的变化。她发现药确实少下去，可怎么也没有想到，这孩子拿药去填起居室的地板缝。

一天，汤姆正埋头给地板缝填药，姨妈的黄猫走了过来，眼盯着汤勺，喵喵地叫个不停，很嘴馋的样子。汤姆说：

“要是不想吃，别叫唤了，彼得。”

可彼得显得很想尝尝的架势。

“你得拿定主意。”

彼得像是真的很想吃。

“那好，既然你想要，我就给你，因为我可不是个小气鬼。要是尝了不喜欢，那可怪不得别人，要怨就怨你自己。”

彼得没异议，汤姆便扒开它的嘴，把药给灌下去。彼得下一子蹦了半天高，怪声怪叫起来，落地之后满屋子乱窜，撞得家具砰砰响，还打翻了几只花盆，闹得天翻地覆。最后后腿直立，昂起脑袋，蹦蹦跳跳绕着圈子，乐颠颠地，叫唤着，显得有说不尽的兴奋。接着又满屋子东奔西跑，所过之处，乱哄哄的，一片狼藉。这时候波莉姨妈进来，猫正好在翻三百六十度的跟斗，拼着老命一声叫唤，从敞开着的窗子蹿了出去，连带把仅存在窗台上的花盆也掀了下去。老太太透过眼镜，看得目瞪口呆。汤姆躺在地板上，笑得喘不过气来。

“汤姆，这猫到底犯了什么毛病？”

“我不知道，姨妈。”汤姆喘着粗气说。

“过去我可从未见过它这模样。到底是什么原因？”

“我真的不知道，波莉姨妈。猫儿高兴的时候老这样。”

“当真？是这样吗？”姨妈的口气让汤姆有点害怕。

“是的，姨妈。我相信，它们是这样。”

“你相信？”

“是的，姨妈。”

老太太弯下身子，汤姆又紧张、又兴致勃勃地注视着她。一等看出她的“动向”，已晚了一步。床帷下露出的汤勺柄泄露了天机。姨妈拿起汤勺，高高举起。汤姆身子一缩，垂下了眼皮。波莉姨妈拎起那常拎的把手——他的耳朵，手上的顶针在他头上敲了几下。

“我说，少爷，你干吗这样对待那不会说话的畜生？”

“我这是可怜它——因为它没有姨妈。”

“没有姨妈？——你这笨蛋。这跟姨妈什么相干？”

“大着哩。要是它有姨妈，她准会拿火烤它，就不会想到人家是人，烤得他的肠子焦烂！”

波莉姨妈一听这话懊悔不迭。她有了全新的眼光看待这事。这样对待猫既然是残酷的，对待一个孩子同样也是残酷的。她感到自责，心也跟着软了下来，眼眶里出现了泪花，手放到汤姆的头上，温和地说：

“我那是一番好意，汤姆。汤姆，那么做对你是有好处的。”

汤姆抬起头，看着她的脸，看得出，难受中他的眼里闪出一丝光芒。

“我知道你是好意，姨妈，我对彼得也是好意。对它也是有好处的。我从未见过它这么兴奋——”

“哦，你走吧，汤姆，可别再惹我生气了。你该努力努力，看能不能做回好孩子。你用不着再吃什么药了。”

汤姆提前到了学校。大家都感到这事挺怪，最近他怎么天天如此？现在，他常常这样，只是在校门口转悠，而没有和同学一块儿玩。他说，他病了。看样子是病了。他装着在东张西望，其实他的目光在注视着学校前面的那条路。不一会儿，杰夫·撒切尔过来了。汤姆立刻脸露喜色。他仔细地打量了片刻，又伤心地转过身子。杰夫·撒切尔来到跟前，汤姆跟他打起招呼，小心翼翼地想把话题引到贝基身上。可这不开窍的小子就是想不到汤姆的真实用意。汤姆看了又看，实指望来个裙子飘飘的女孩子，可见到不是他望眼欲穿的那位，心里恨恨的。最后，穿裙子的再也不出现了，他也垂头丧气地进了空荡荡的教室，坐下来承受痛苦煎熬。后来校门口又出现了一位穿裙子的，汤姆的心猛一跳，紧接着往外就跑，像印第安人那样“表起演”来：又是笑，又是叫，追逐男孩子，冒死翻栅栏，也不怕摔胳膊断腿，翻跟斗，拿大顶——拿得出来的英雄手段全使出来了，可目光始终旁视，看贝基是不是注意到他。可她就是旁若无人，对他不理不睬。是不是她压根就没有注意到他在这里？于是他干脆就到了她跟前表演起英雄壮举来。他模仿印第安人作战时那样喊着嚷着，抢了一个男孩子的帽子，一把扔到教室屋顶上，在一群男孩子中左冲右突，撞得他们东倒西歪，自己在贝基眼皮底下翻身倒地，险些撞倒了她——她鼻子朝天，转过身去，只听得她说：“哼！有人自以为了不起——老爱出风头！”

汤姆脸孔火辣辣的。他爬了起来，垂头丧气，没精打采，悄悄走了。





第十三章


现在汤姆已下定了决心。他灰心丧气，绝望透顶。他说自己成了个没人理睬、缺朋少友的孩子。没人喜欢他。可要是他们一旦发现自己把他逼到这般地步，会后悔莫及的。他原是想做个规规矩矩的好孩子，跟他们和好，可他们不让。他们就是不想跟他好，随他们吧。落到这样的结果全怪罪他，那就怪罪吧——干吗不呢？没有朋友的人哪有权利好抱怨的？是的，是他们逼得他落得这样的下场。他就要过着罪人的日子。别无选择。

这时他已来到远远的“芳草地”，隐隐约约听到学校的钟声响起。他一想到自己将永远永远听不到这听惯了的熟悉钟声，不禁哭泣起来。他恋恋不舍，但他是被迫无奈的，他是被逼着走向这冷酷无情的世界的。他只好屈从——但是他宽恕他们。他哭得越来越凶，哭声越来越响。

就在这节骨眼，他遇见了自己心贴心的好朋友乔·哈珀。他目光坚毅，显而易见，他心中藏着个了不起的、不可告人的主意。这下真的是“两个人一条心”了。汤姆边用袖子抹眼泪，边断断续续向对方诉说自己的遭遇，说他在家里受到粗暴对待、缺少温暖，决心离家出走，天南地北闯荡一番，永不回来。最后希望乔不要忘了他。

巧的是这也是乔想对汤姆提出的要求，他此来正是为这一目的找汤姆的。原来他的母亲怀疑他偷吃了奶酪，抽了他一顿鞭子，可他尝也没尝一口，压根就不知道有这些奶酪。明摆着，她这是嫌弃他了，巴不得他走。如果这是她的真实想法，那他就顺着她，让她开心。她是不会因赶走自己苦命的孩子，任他沦落到这无情的世界，受苦受难死去而后悔的。

两个孩子悲悲切切地走着走着，一路上还订了一个新盟约，说好今后要互相扶持，成为好哥们，至死不分离，有难同当。接着两个人开始谈起了今后的计划。乔说他想做一名隐士，隐居在一个偏远的洞窟里，吃糠咽菜，在饥寒交迫、伤心绝望中慢慢死去。但是听了汤姆的设想后，他承认，倒还是过着犯点小罪的生活有明显的好处，那去当名海盗他也没有意见。

圣彼得斯堡南面的三英里处，便是密西西比河了，河宽一英里，河中有一座狭长的小岛，树木葱茏，岛的前面有个浅滩，正好当作他们很好的碰头地方。岛上没住人，远远地延伸到对面河岸附近，与其平行的是一片茂密的人迹罕至的森林。于是他们就看中了这个叫杰克逊岛的小岛。既然是海盗，那先对谁动手，倒是没有想过。后来他俩又找来了哈克贝利·费恩，他一口答应入伙，因为他干什么事绝不挑剔，全不在乎。于是三个人便分头行动，说好在彼此方便的时刻，也就是说深夜，在村北两英里一个僻静的地方会合。岛上有只小木筏，他们想把它夺过来。三个人都带上钩子和绳索，以及作为不法之徒所能施展的肮脏而神秘的手段搞到的种种装备。下午还未过去，他们就急不可耐地等着享受这样的甜蜜荣光，到时候全镇子都在议论纷纷，说是就要发生一件大事，而听到这一模糊不清的消息的人无不得到吩咐，要他们“不可声张，等着看结果”。

半夜时分，汤姆搞到了一块煮火腿和几样零碎的东西来了。他站在一个小峭壁下的灌木丛中，从这里可以俯瞰到会面地点。天上星光闪烁，四周一片寂静。静静而宽阔的大河看似一片海洋。汤姆谛听了一会儿，但没有任何声音打破这片恬静。他发出一声低而清晰的口哨声。峭壁下有人回了一声。汤姆又吹了两声，对方同样有了回应。接着有人警惕地问了一句：

“哪个？”

“汤姆·索亚。西班牙海船上的黑衣复仇者。报上你的姓名！”

“血手大盗哈克·费恩和海上阎王乔·哈珀。”这些头衔都是汤姆从他喜欢的小说里找来的。

“很好。口令！”

只听得两个嘶哑的声音同时对着沉睡中的夜空报出了一个令人心惊肉跳的字：

血！

汤姆听罢把火腿扔过峭壁，自己也跟着下来，结果皮肤和衣服不同程度遭了殃。峭壁下河岸上有条便捷易行的小径，但缺乏海盗所看重的那种艰难和危险的氛围。

海上阎王带来一片咸肉，一路上把他累了个半死。血手大盗偷来一只长柄平底锅和一些晒烤得半干的烟叶，外加几个玉米棒芯可用作烟斗。可三名海盗除了他自己，别两个人都不抽烟或“嚼烟草”。西班牙海船的黑衣复仇者说，没有火，什么也办不成。这是一个有先见之明的说法。当年火柴还是稀罕之物。他们看见在上游一百码开外的一条大木筏上生着一堆火。三个人偷偷摸了过去，拿来一块烧着的木块，当作是经历了一次了不起的冒险，嘴里不停地发出嘘声，还时不时突然停下来，把手指儿放到嘴唇。行进中，想象中手里握着短刀，嘴里轻声发出庄严的命令：如果“敌人”轻举妄动，就一刀捅过去，深深刺死他，因为“死人是不会告发的”。他们很清楚，木筏上的人这时候不是在村子的店铺里，就是去寻欢作乐了，但他们不能以此为借口就不按海盗方式行事。

于是他们撑着木筏走了。汤姆做指挥，哈克掌后桨，乔管前桨。汤姆立在筏子中央位置，神情威严，眉毛紧锁，双手抱胸，威严地低声发出命令：

“掉转船头，抢风行驶！”

“是，得令，长官！”

“稳住，稳——住！”

“是，稳——住，长官！”

“外转！”

“是，外转，长官！”

三个孩子稳稳而单调地撑着木筏朝河中央而去，一看就知道，汤姆下的这些命令只是装腔作势，毫无实际意义。

“这会儿挂的啥样帆？”

“大横帆，中横帆，三角帆，长官。”

“升大桅帆！直升到顶！我说，你们六个——升起前中桅的副帆。加把劲，嘿！”

“是，得令，长官！”

“快要起风了！左转舵！迎风转舵！齐心协力干，伙计们！”

“是，得令，长官！”

“向前！风来时，站稳了！左舷，左舷！加把劲，伙计！站稳了！”

“站稳了，长官。”

三个孩子把木筏划到了河中央后，拨正了船头，划起了桨。河水不深，流速只有两三英里。在此后的三刻钟内，大家一声不吭，这时候木筏已远远驶过镇子，见到的只有镇上闪出的稀稀拉拉的灯火。透过映在水面上的点点星光，沉睡中的镇子隐约可见，它意识不到此时此刻正发生着大事。那黑衣复仇者仍然双手抱胸挺立着，“最后一望”这个曾给他带来快乐，又令他痛苦不堪的地方，实指望那个“她”这时能看到他正置身在波涛汹涌的大海上，无所畏惧地面对凶险和死亡，嘴角带着微笑行走在不归途中。就在他紧张地沉醉在想象之中，短短的刹那间，他对杰克逊岛竟视而不见，在朝镇子作“最后一望”时，他既感到忧伤，又显得心满意足。另两名海盗也在作最后的一望。他们望了很久很久，想不到水流险些把木筏远远冲离杰克逊岛。好在他俩及时发现了这危险，全力避开了险情。深夜两点钟光景，木筏在岛的前部约莫两百码的沙洲上搁浅了，涉水来回好几趟才把货物搬上了岸。小木筏上的东西有一张旧帆，他们把它在灌木丛上铺开，成了一个帐篷，用来遮盖食物，而天气好的时候，他们只好睡在露天底下了，这很符合海盗的做法。

向密林深处走了二三十步，紧挨着一根木段，他们紧靠木段，生起了一堆火，用平底锅烧好咸肉当晚餐，消耗掉了带来的足足一半的玉米饼。在这么一个远离人世、没有人烟的原始密林中，自由自在大摆宴席，真是人生一大快事，还表示再也不回到文明世界了。闪烁不定的殷红火光照亮了他们的脸庞，映红了森林中他们的圣殿里挺立着的树树干干，也照亮了亮晶晶的绿叶和悬挂着的色彩绚烂的藤蔓。吃罢最后一片煎得松脆的咸肉，吞下了最后一口分到手的玉米饼，三个孩子心满意足，伸了伸懒腰，在草地上躺了下来。他们本可以找个更清凉的地方躺躺，可实在舍不得这极富浪漫情调、热烘烘的篝火。

“这下够快活吧？”乔说。

“快活得没法说了。”汤姆道，“要是让别的孩子看见，他们会说些什么？”

“说什么？能到这儿来还不开心死了——是不是，哈克？”

“我估摸是这样，”哈克贝利说，“反正合我的意。再也找不到比这儿更让人开心的地方了。平日里我老吃不饱——再说也没人上这儿来揍人，不把你当人看。”

“我要的就是这样的生活，”汤姆说，“大清早用不着起床啦，上学啦，洗脸刷牙啦，做这些个该死的破事。知道吗，乔，海盗上了岸，就用不着非做什么事不可的，可要是隐士那得没完没了地祷告，老孤零零一个人，没一丁点快活。”

“不错，是这个样。”乔说，“之前我就没有多想过这档子事。这会儿试了一下，当个海盗可真叫好。”

“知道吗，”汤姆道，“不像古时候，如今想做隐士人不多了。可海盗呢，始终受人尊敬。再说，隐士睡觉时得尽可能找个最硬的地方，头上还得披上麻布，抹上灰，下雨时站在露天底下，还有——”

“头上干吗披上麻布，抹上灰？”哈克贝利问。

“不知道。可他们非这么做不可。隐士都得这么做的。要是你去做隐士，也得这么做。”

“我可不愿干。”哈克说。

“那你怎么办？”

“说不上。可就是不愿干。”

“得了，哈克，你非干不可。不干过得了关吗？”

“我就是受不了。那我就逃走。”

“逃走？那不成了天底下最要不得的隐士了吗？太丢人了。”

血手大盗忙着别的事，没有搭腔。他刚掏空一只玉米芯，插上一根芦苇管，塞进烟叶，夹了一块火炭，点上了烟，吞云吐雾起来，陶醉在香喷喷的烟雾中，怡然自得。另两名海盗对他这一恶习羡慕不已，暗暗下决心，短时间里学会它。哈克便问；

“那海盗得干些啥？”

汤姆说：

“过的日子那叫痛快哩——抢了人家的船，烧了，抢到的钱，埋起来，埋在他们岛上吓人的地方，有鬼怪什么的替他们守着，船上人的性命一个也不留下——逼他们跳海。”

“他们把女人带上岛，”乔说，“他们是不杀女人的。”

“是的，不杀，”汤姆肯定说，“他们就是不杀妇女——太了不起。带上岛的妇女个个挺漂亮的。”

“穿的衣服不都是挺讲究吗！哦！个个穿金戴银，珠光宝气。”乔兴致勃勃道。

“你说谁？”哈克问。

“不是海盗，还有谁？”

哈克可怜巴巴地看了看自己的一身寒酸装束。

“我这身打扮可不配做海盗。”他说，听声音他很沮丧，挺难受，“可除了这身上的，我没别的衣服。”

另两个孩子说，只要他们把冒险事业干下去，很快好衣服不愁没有。他们让哈克明白，虽然有钱的海盗开始时照例打扮得很风光，但他穿着破衣烂衫也可以凑合着干起来的。

渐渐他们的话越来越少，倦意袭上了这几个小流浪儿的眼皮。烟斗从血手大盗的手指间滑了下来，倦意蒙眬中他不知不觉间睡着了。海上阎王和西班牙海船的黑衣复仇者一时却难以入睡。他俩躺着，默默地做了祷告，因为这时候身边没有说话管用的人逼着他们跪着大声念祷词。事实上，他们内心就不愿祷告，只是怕太不守规矩会招来天打雷劈。后来他们很快便进入瞌睡蒙眬的状态，偏在这时有样东西硬是过来干扰，硬是不走。那就是良心。他俩开始隐隐担心这么偷偷跑出来是不是做错了。接着又想到了偷来的肉，良心真的折磨起他们来了。于是他们辩解道，以前也多次偷吃过甜食和苹果，不是没事吗？可是良心是听不进这些个似是而非的小事的。最后，他们似乎觉得有一个事实是无论如何推翻不了的，那就是拿人家的甜食不过是“顺手牵羊”而已，而拿火腿、咸肉和值钱的东西，那显然才是不折不扣的盗窃——《圣经》上就有“不许偷盗”这么一条戒律。于是他俩暗下决心，只要他们还干这一行，绝不让盗窃行为玷污他们的海盗生涯。最后良心不再来纠缠，这两个性格古怪、思想摇摆不定的海盗才得以安然进入梦乡。





第十四章


早晨，汤姆一觉醒来，恍惚中竟不知道自己身在哪里。他立起身，揉了揉眼睛，打量四周，这才明白过来。这是个凉爽而灰蒙蒙的清晨，树林一片深沉的静寂，焕发出一种安宁而怡人的氛围。树叶纹丝不动。没有什么声音搅扰大自然的沉思。树叶和青草上闪烁着串串露珠。篝火上覆盖着一层白色的灰烬，蓝色的轻烟袅袅，飘向高空。乔和哈克还没有醒来。

这时候在树林深处响起了一只鸟的唤声，紧接着又听到另一只啄木鸟叫了起来与之遥相呼应。渐渐地，清凉的灰色晨曦消融，天色更亮，种种声响也慢慢地跟着丰富起来，处处显得生机勃勃。大自然苏醒过来，在这个陷入沉思中的孩子面前展示自己美妙的奇景。一只绿色的小毛虫爬过一片沾满露珠的叶子，时不时抬起三分之二的身躯，到处“嗅嗅”，像汤姆说的，它这是在作丈量哩。这毛虫主动向他爬了过来，可他还是一动不动坐着。毛虫直向他过来，又好像要爬向别处，他忽而满怀希望，忽而失落。最后，不意间毛虫弯曲的身子伸向空中，痛苦地迟疑了一会儿，毅然决然地落到汤姆的腿上，开始在他身上作了一番游历，喜得他心花怒放——这意味着他将得到一套新衣服。毫无疑问，是一套艳丽的海盗服。这时候不知从哪里出来一群蚂蚁，忙着它们的活儿。有一只蚂蚁大无畏地抓住一只比它身体大五倍的死蜘蛛，跌跌撞撞，往树干爬。一只长着褐色斑点的瓢虫爬到一张高高挺立着的青草顶上，汤姆欠下身子，紧贴着它，说：“瓢虫呀，瓢虫，快回家，你家着火了，你的孩子可没人管。”瓢虫听了展开翅膀回家看个究竟——汤姆对此并不感到大惊小怪，因为他早就听说，只要提到哪里着火，瓢虫就信以为真，上当受骗。他不只一次对这种头脑简单的昆虫做过试验。接着又来了一只金龟子，拖着粪球一个劲往前挪，汤姆用手碰了碰，只见它收拢了腿脚，装起死来了。说话间鸟儿唧唧喳喳欢叫起来。飞来一只猫鸟，它也叫北方学舌鸟，停在汤姆头顶的树枝上，埋头学着四周鸟儿的叫声，煞是高兴。又来了一只松鸦，尖声怪叫，从天而降，像一道蓝色的火焰一闪而过，近近地停在汤姆几乎伸手可及的树枝上，歪着脑袋，好奇地打量这几位陌生客。一只灰松鼠、一只跟狐狸有点沾亲带故的家伙急急忙忙奔过来，立起身子时不时打量这三个孩子，朝他们嘀咕几声。不过这两个畜生也许平生没见过人类，说不好它们这是感到害怕还是不害怕。这时候整个大自然已经彻底苏醒，开始骚动起来。长长的阳光似箭如矛，穿枝渡叶，直落在远远近近的繁枝密叶上，几只蝴蝶翩翩而来，与这良辰美景融在一起。

汤姆推醒另两名海盗，他们双双喊着嚷着，跑了开去。一两分钟后他们已脱光了衣服，在白色沙洲晶莹清澈的浅水里追逐、翻腾。他们不再留恋茫茫河水对岸远处那个沉睡中的小村子了。一股湍流，也许是稍稍上涨的河水已把他们的木筏冲走了。这正合他们的心意，没有了木筏不啻是烧了他们通向文明社会的桥梁。

他们回到宿营地，神清气爽，喜笑颜开，只觉得饿得不行，很快就生旺了篝火。哈克在附近找到了一眼泉水，清澈透明，他们用橡树和野胡桃宽大的叶子做了几只杯子，喝起了泉水，只觉得那水带有一种野生树木的香甜，足可与咖啡媲美。乔在为早餐忙着切咸肉，汤姆和哈克让他停会儿，三个人一起到了河边一个很有希望钓到鱼的地方，抛出了钓鱼线。很快就有了收获。乔的兴致还很浓，可他们就停止不钓了，带回去几条漂亮的鲈鱼、两条翻车鱼，还有一条小鲶鱼——多得足够一家人饱餐一顿。他们把这些鱼与咸肉一起煮着吃，结果让人惊呆了，想不到鱼的味道竟这等鲜美。他们不懂得淡水鱼越新鲜下锅，味道越好的道理。他们也没有想到，这是露天睡眠、露天运动、游水和狠狠饿了一场所带来的好处，无异是在鱼里又添加了一种鲜美的佐料。

早饭后，三个孩子在树荫下四散躺了一会儿。哈克抽了一会儿烟后，几个人一起钻进树林探险去了。他们兴高采烈地一路过去，跨过倒地的朽木，钻过枝条虬结的灌木丛，穿行在一棵棵号称森林之王的威严大树间，野葡萄藤根根像皇冠上长长的饰带，垂挂下来。后来他们到了令人心旷神怡的所在，绿茵遍地，香花簇簇。

他们找到了许多赏心悦目的东西，可是没一件是令人惊奇的。他们发现，这岛长约三英里，宽四分之一英里，离河岸最近处有一条不足两百码宽的水道。他们每隔一小时就游一回水，所以回到营地，半个下午已过去了。他们已是饥肠辘辘，顾不得停下来钓鱼，冷火腿也吃得津津有味。后来他们在树荫下躺下来，说一会儿话，但很快就失去了兴趣，干脆不再吭声了。林子里一片寂静，显得那么庄严肃穆和孤独，大大影响了三个孩子的心绪，于是便思索起来。一种难以言表的渴望悄悄袭上心头，很快这种渴望变得隐隐约约，有形有体了——他们萌生出想家的念头了。就连血手大盗费恩也想念起了那些他睡过的门前台阶和空木桶，但大家都为自己的这些弱点感到丢脸，谁也没有足够的勇气把自己的想法说出来。

这时候，孩子们恍恍惚惚间似乎听到远处一种特别的声音，已响了好一会儿了，就像是人们有时不经意间听到的时钟的滴答声，只是没有十分留意。这时这种神秘的声音越来越清晰，不能不引起注意。三个孩子都吃了一惊，相互对视一眼后，便都摆出仔细倾听的姿势。四周笼罩在深沉而打不破的寂静之中，过了很久远处传来一阵沉闷的轰隆声。

“什么声音？”乔压低声音惊叫道。

“我也想问呢。”汤姆低声道。

“雷声，”哈克贝利惶恐地说，“因为雷——”

“听！”汤姆说，“听——别说话。”

三个人等了一会儿，像是过了一辈子似的，接着同样沉闷的轰隆声打破了肃穆的寂静。

“看看去！”

三个孩子立即跳起身子，急忙向朝镇子的河岸奔去。他们拨开河岸上的灌木，朝河面看去。河下游约莫一英里处有艘用作摆渡的小汽艇，顺流飘着。宽宽的甲板上挤满了人。渡船的周围有许多小船，有的有人划着，有的随波逐流，但是三个孩子拿不准，船上的人到底在干什么。很快船的一边船舷冒出一大股白烟，白烟像云朵，懒洋洋地在扩散，上升，随之又传来同样沉闷的轰隆声。

“现在我知道了！”汤姆惊叫道，“有人淹死了！”

“不错，”哈克说，“去年夏天，比尔·特纳淹死的时候，他们也这么干。他们对着河面放炮，好让他浮上来。他们还拿来一块块面包，里面灌满水银，丢进水里，让它飘着，只要到了有淹死人的地方，面包就停下来不动了。”

“不错，我听说是这么回事。”乔说，“可我不明白，面包怎么会有这能耐。”

“哦，面包可没这能耐，”汤姆说，“我估摸多半是因为他们事先给面包念了什么咒语，然后抛进了水里。”

“可他们什么也没念，”哈克说，“我亲眼所见，什么也没念。”

“那就怪了。”汤姆说，“兴许是他们心中默默念的。肯定是这样。大家都知道是这回事。”

那两个孩子听了觉得汤姆说得有道理，因为没头没脑的面包，要是没被施了法，哪能让它去执行这么重大的使命，而且干得这么出色？

“老天爷，这会儿我真想上那儿看看去。”乔说。

“我也想去，”哈克说，“要是让我知道那是谁，我什么都愿拿出来。”

三个孩子继续听下去，看下去。不一会儿，汤姆心头突然闪出一个想法，嚷了起来：

“伙计们，我知道谁淹死了。是咱们！”

顷刻间，他们一下子都成了大英雄似的。人家这是在举行隆重的仪式，在思念他们，悼念他们，为了他们伤透了心，在痛哭流涕，想起过去亏待这几个失踪了的孩子，懊悔不及。可任你怎么悔恨，百般歉疚，也无济于事。最令人叫绝的是，现在他们这三个逝去的人已成了全镇人的议论中心了，所有的孩子一想到他们成了大名人，都妒忌得要命。好极了。海盗毕竟值得一做。

夜幕降临，渡船回去执行例行的任务，那些小船也不见了。三名海盗返回营地，无不为自己再次获得的辉煌和制造的巨大麻烦而欢欣鼓舞。他们钓来鱼，准备好晚饭。吃过之后，开始猜测起镇里人会如何议论他们，如何看待他们。他们勾画出了一幅幅公众如何悲惨的画面，他们看来，却是一件赏心乐事。但是当夜色笼罩了他们的身影，他们的话语渐渐少了下去，最后便一声不吭，只是呆呆地眼望着篝火，心想着别的地方。这时候再也兴奋不起来了，汤姆和乔不由自主回想起家里的一些人，他们是不会像自己那样欣赏这样的恶作剧的。他们开始忐忑不安，心里难受，烦躁而痛苦，不禁唉声叹气起来。慢慢地乔转弯抹角试探着问他们对重回文明有何想法——不是此时此刻，而是……

汤姆给了他一通讽刺，封了他的口，本来中立的哈克便站到汤姆的一边。结果这个动摇分子赶快作出“解释”，尽力洗刷自己身上沾上的胆小鬼和恋家的污点，幸好最终还是留得个清白之身。“军心”总算稳定了下来。

夜越来越深，哈克跟着打起了盹，很快便响起了呼噜声。乔也随后跟进。汤姆头枕在胳膊上，一动不动躺着，紧紧盯着他俩看。不久他小心翼翼跪着站了起来，来到草丛中，在摇曳的篝火光映射下寻找起来。他捡来几片半圆形白色梧桐树皮，审视过后，选了两片合意的。然后跪在篝火前，用“红赭石”费力地在树皮上写了几个字。接着把其中的一片卷起来放进了外衣的口袋，另一片放进乔的帽子里，再把帽子拿到离乔稍远的地方。他还在乔的帽子里放进小学生心目中的无价之宝——一截粉笔、一只橡皮球、三只鱼钩、一颗被称作“货真价实的水晶球”的弹珠。最后他踮起脚尖小小心心进了林子，到了他认为两个伙伴再也听不到他动静的地方，便拼命朝沙洲直奔过去。





第十五章


几分钟后，汤姆到了沙洲的浅水中，着水朝伊利诺伊州那边的河岸而去。他到了河中央，水还没有齐腰深，但水流湍急，再也不能水过去了，所以他便满怀信心地要把剩下来的一百码游过去。他顶着水流，斜着向前游去，不料水流太急，他很快被冲向下游。但是最终他还是游到了对岸，人就这么漂着，直漂到一个低矮的地方，爬上了岸。他摸了摸外衣的口袋，发现那片树皮还在，便一头钻进一片树林，浑身湿漉漉地，衣服滴着水，沿着河岸走去。不久，十点钟，他来到镇子对面一片开阔地，只见那只渡轮还停在高高河岸的树荫下。闪烁的星光下，万籁无声。他东张西望，爬下河岸，下了水，胳膊划了三两下就爬上渡轮尾部的一条“备用”小划子里。他在划手座下面躺了下来，气喘吁吁，等待着。

不久船上刺耳的钟声响了，有人发出了“开船”的命令。一两分钟后，船首高高翘起，迎风破浪。航行开始了。汤姆觉得挺开心，因为自己这一招终于成功了。他知道，这是这条渡轮夜间最后一个航班。熬过了漫长的二十或十五分钟之后，渡船终于停了下来，汤姆溜下船，乘着夜色游到了岸上。免得被迷了路的人遇见，他特意向下游游了五十码才上了岸。

他急急忙忙过了几条少有人来往的小巷，很快就到了姨妈家的后栅栏。他翻过栅栏，进了厢房，朝起居室窗内一看，里面亮着灯，波莉姨妈、锡德、玛丽、乔·哈珀的妈妈全都坐在那里，说着话。大家坐在床边，床就在他们和门之间。汤姆到了门前，悄悄地拨开门闩，轻轻一推，门开了一条缝。他又小小心心推了推。门每吱嘎一响，他就吓一跳，最后他估计跪着身子能挤进去了，便把头伸了进去，小小心心往里爬。

“哪来的风吹得蜡烛摇摇晃晃的？”波莉姨妈说。汤姆加快了速度。“我看门像是开了。哟，果然开着。这年头怪事没完没了。锡德，快过去关上门。”

汤姆借机藏到了床底下。他趴着喘了口气，便爬到姨妈脚跟前。

“我不是说过吗，”波莉姨妈道，“他人不坏，只是太淘气了点。不守规矩，冒冒失失的，这你们是知道的。到底还是个毛孩子，能负多少责任呢？他向来心眼不坏，是天底下最善良的孩子。”她说到这里，哭哭啼啼起来。

“我家的乔也一个样——老闹腾个不休，哪样错都犯。可一向心地善良，一点自私心也没有。上帝宽恕我吧，想起来我真不该硬说他偷吃奶酪，还拿鞭子抽他。可就是记不起是奶酪酸了，我自个儿扔了的。这辈子再也见不到他了。见不到了，再也见不到我那受屈的苦命孩子！”接着哈珀太太哭得心都碎了。

“但愿汤姆在那里日子过得更舒坦，”锡德说，“不过要是他在世的时候行为多检点些——”

“锡德！”汤姆能感觉得到老太太对着锡德露出的严厉的目光，“现在他已不在人世，你可不能说他半句坏话。上帝会关照他的——你别多嘴多舌，老祖宗。哦，哈珀太太，我怎么丢得下他呢，怎么丢得下他！虽说他老折磨我这颗老迈的心，可他到底是我的心肝宝贝。”

“是上帝赐给了我们，也是上帝收回了他。感谢上帝的大恩大德吧！可到底太让人伤心了——太让人伤心了。就在上星期六，他在我的眼皮底下放爆竹，我一脚踢得他趴倒在地。那时我压根就没想到他就这么快没了。要是他再来放一次，我准会搂着他，愿上帝多保佑他哩。”

“对，对，对，是这么回事，我理解你的心情，哈珀太太。我完全理解。就在昨天中午，我家的汤姆捉了小猫，喂了它一肚子止痛药。我以为那小畜生准会闹腾个天翻地覆。老天宽恕我吧，我竟拿顶针狠敲了他的脑袋。可怜的孩子，可怜我那死去的孩子。现在他已脱离了苦海。我听他最后说的一句话是责怪……”

但是往事不堪回首。老太太说到这里伤心得说不下去了。汤姆听着听着鼻子酸酸的，抽起了鼻子——他这不是同情别人，而是可怜自己。他听到玛丽时不时为他哭哭啼啼，插嘴说他好话。他开始觉得自己其实挺高贵的，并不是个卑微的人。不过最让他感动的是姨妈，她那么伤心，自己恨不得从床底下钻出来出其不意给她个天大的惊喜——他天生就会感情冲动，爱搞些戏剧性的场面，但还是克制着，一动不动在床下躺着。

他接着听下去，从他们的只言片语中，他听出：开始时，他们以为这三个孩子准是游泳时淹死了。后来又发现木筏丢失，又有几个孩子说，这三名丢失的孩子曾说过，镇子很快就会发生“大动静”的，几个脑子灵的人根据这种种迹象认定，他们准是坐着木筏跑掉了，很快就会在下一个镇子露面的，可很快他们的希望落了空。快到中午，木筏在村子的下游五六英里的密苏里河的河岸附近搁浅了，如此说来他们准是淹死了，要不到了夜里他们饥饿难耐非得回家不可。大家都认为，打捞尸体之所以一无所获，完全是因为他们是在河中央淹死的，不是吗，这三个孩子个个都是游泳好手，要是在别处落水，他们都能游上岸的。现在是星期三晚上。要是星期天之前尸体还没有着落，那就毫无指望，星期天上午就要举行葬礼了。汤姆一听直哆嗦。

哈珀太太抽抽搭搭，道过晚安，转身要走。两位同遭丧亲之痛的妇女冲动之下，互相拥抱，失声痛哭一阵之后，才相互告别。波莉姨妈对锡德和玛丽道晚安的口气比平日温和多了，锡德低声哭泣，玛丽则号啕大哭起来。

波莉姨妈跪下为汤姆祈祷，情真意切，感人至深。她的话语和苍老颤抖的声音充满无限的爱，没等她祈祷完毕，汤姆已哭成泪人儿了。波莉姨妈上床后很久，汤姆一直不敢动弹，因为她时不时发出伤心的呼号，辗转反侧，十分不安。她终于安静下来，但睡梦中还是偶尔发出叹息声。这时候汤姆才偷偷爬出来，挨着床沿慢慢立起身子，一手挡住烛光，站着正视她一阵。他心里充满了对她的怜意。他掏出一片梧桐树皮，放到蜡烛旁。他又想起了什么，便犹豫起来。他终于心里做出决定，脸上顿时呈现出喜色。他急忙把树皮放回口袋，俯身吻了吻她那苍白的嘴唇，径直悄悄到了门口，开了门，随手闩上门闩，走了。

他转弯抹角回到渡轮码头，发现那里没人，大着胆进了渡轮，因为他知道，船上除了看船的，没别的人，而看船的这时早已回自己的安乐窝，睡得活像只死猪。他解下船尾的小划子，悄无声息地上了小船，小心翼翼地往上游划去。到了离镇子一英里的地方，转了向，弯腰使劲径直朝对岸划去。他上了岸，干得干净利落，说来这活对他熟门熟路。他本想把小划子留下来作战利品，理由很充分：他且把小划子看成是艘大船，而大船正是海盗打劫的目标。但他知道，如此一来，人家必然会大动干戈，做彻底搜查，真相就会暴露。于是他上了岸，钻进了林子。

他坐下来休息了好一会儿，竭力不让自己睡着，然后小心翼翼地起程走完最后一段路。黑夜很快就要过去了。他来到小岛沙洲前时，曙光初露。他又休息了一会儿，眼看太阳已完全升上地平线，阳光将河水染得金光点点，他纵身跃入河中，不久之后，他浑身湿漉漉地在营地附近停了下来，只听得乔说：

“不，哈克，汤姆挺仁义的，他会回来的。他不会溜号的。他知道，海盗不会干这种丢脸的事，他挺傲气，决不会溜号的。他是干什么事去了。什么事呢，我说不准。”

“反正这些东西都归咱们了，是不是？”

“有点道理，可还是说不准。树皮上只写着，要是他赶不回来吃早饭，这些东西才归咱们。”

“他不是来了吗！”汤姆大声说道，演戏似的，高高兴兴地进了营地。

早餐吃的是咸肉和鱼，很丰盛，很快就做好了，三个孩子吃了起来。汤姆讲了自己这趟回家的经历，免不了加油添醋渲染了一番。说完之后，三个人个个都成了自吹自擂、爱虚荣的好汉。饭后汤姆找了个僻静的树荫，直睡到大中午。其他两名海盗则忙着为捕鱼和探险做准备。





第十六章


中饭后，这一帮海盗去沙洲找乌龟蛋。他们四处寻找，用棍棒往沙中戳，发现软的地方，就跪下来用手抠。有时候在一个洞里能找到五六十枚乌龟蛋。龟蛋白白的，圆圆的，比英国胡桃小点。当天晚上他们美美地享用了一顿丰盛的煎蛋，星期五早晨又吃了一顿。

吃了早饭，一伙人呐喊着直向沙洲奔去，在沙洲上你追我赶，边跑边脱衣服，最后脱得一丝不挂，闹腾着，跑进了沙洲的浅水洼，迎着湍急的水流，听任河水没过腿肚子，给他们平添了不少乐趣。有时候三个人挤挤挨挨在一起，用手掌互相往脸上泼水，挨得太近时，就转过脸去，免得被水花溅得透不过气来。最后三个人扭成了一团，打打闹闹，直到本领最高强的人把别人摁入水中方才罢手。然后大家都钻入水中，三对雪白的手脚纠缠在一起，闹腾一阵之后，大家都钻出水面，鼻子嘴巴喷着水花，喘着大气，大笑不止。

玩累了，三个孩子便躺倒在热烘烘的干沙上，摊手摊脚，用沙子把自己埋起来。过一会儿，又跑到水里去，再玩一遍刚才玩过的游戏。最后他们的裸露的皮肤足可以充当小丑穿的肉色“紧身衣”，于是便围成一圈，表演起了马戏——一场马戏居然有了三名小丑，谁也不愿把这么出尽风头的角色让给别人。

接着他们掏出弹珠子，玩起了各种花样的游戏，玩腻了才歇手。乔和哈克又去游了一会儿水，汤姆不敢去游，因为他刚才在甩裤子时，把那串响尾蛇铃铛甩掉了。他想不通，没有了这件护身符，刚才游了这么久，自己怎么没抽筋。不找到他是不敢再下水的。说话间，其他两名小孩游累了，准备歇息了。三个人分头各自东走西逛，情绪渐渐地低落下去，怀着渴望的神色，眺望起河对岸那沐浴在阳光下的镇子。汤姆用大脚趾在沙上写了“贝基”两个字，又赶忙抹掉，他为自己这样不争气而生气。但抹掉后他又写了一遍。他这是情不自禁。他再次抹了它。他把其他两个同伙叫在一起，一块儿玩，这才摆脱了相思之苦。

但是乔的精神已到萎靡不堪的境地，他太想家了，他再也受不了这份痛苦。泪珠儿眼看着就要夺眶而出。哈克也感到很不是滋味。汤姆情绪低落，但竭力不表现出来。他有一个秘密，只是这会儿不想说出来。如果这种难以遏制的压抑情绪不解决，他很可能要透露出来了。他装得兴致勃勃，说：

“伙计，我敢肯定，从前这个岛上出没过海盗。咱们再去打探打探。他们在这儿的某个地方藏了宝。要是有那么一只破箱子，里面尽是金银财宝，你们有什么感觉——嗯？”

但这话只点燃了一点点热情，对方居然没有搭腔，等于当头泼了盆冷水。汤姆又抛出一两个诱饵，但都没有奏效。真叫人丧气。乔坐着，用棍子拨弄着沙子，脸色阴沉。最后他说：

“哦，伙计们，算了吧，我想回家了。这儿太寂寞了。”

“哦，别，乔，慢慢地你就会开心起来的。”汤姆说，“单想想这儿钓鱼多好玩。”

“我才不在乎钓鱼哩。我要回家。”

“可乔，哪里找得到这样理想的游泳地方？”

“游泳有什么好？虽然这儿没人拦着我游泳，这点好处我不在乎。我就是想回家。”

“呸！毛孩子！我看，你是想娘了。”

“不错，我是想念娘了。要是你也有娘，你准会想念的。你说我是毛孩子，你也好不了多少。”乔说罢抽起了鼻子。

“得了，咱们就让这哭鼻子的毛孩子回家见他娘去吧，怎么样，哈克？可怜的东西。他不是想娘了吗？那就让他走吧。你喜欢留下来，是不是，哈克？咱俩就待在这儿，怎么样？”

哈克答道：“好——吧。”答得十分勉强。

“这辈子我再也不理你了，”乔说着站了起来，“从现在开始。”他怏怏不乐地走了开去，穿起了衣服。

“谁稀罕？”汤姆说，“没人需要你。回家去吧，看人家不笑话你。哦，好你个海盗！哈克跟我可不是哭哭啼啼的毛小孩。咱俩就待在这儿，是不是，哈克？他要是想走，就走吧。我看，没有他咱们也会过得好好的。”

话虽这么说，可汤姆心里还是不踏实。他一见乔板着脸穿衣服，很不安。而且哈克怀着渴望的神情看着乔做离去的准备，始终一言不发，这情景让汤姆产生一种不祥的预感，引起了他的警觉。很快，乔一句告别的话也没说，着水向伊利诺伊那边过去了。汤姆的心一沉。他瞥了哈克一眼。哈克受不了投过来的目光，垂下了眼皮，说：

“我也想走，汤姆。待在这儿太寂寞了，今后更糟。咱俩也走吧，汤姆。”

“我不想走，要是你想，干脆走吧。我说过我要留下来。”

“汤姆，我还是走的好。”

“得了，走吧——哪个硬要拦着你？”

哈克动手收集起自己四散的衣服。他说：

“汤姆，我希望你也走吧。好好琢磨琢磨。我们到了岸边等着你来。”

“得了，愿意等就等吧，别嫌等太久了。就这话。”

哈克伤心地走了，汤姆望着他的背影。他内心也很想走，但出于自尊心，不能不压下这强烈的愿望。他希望那两个孩子能停下脚步，等着他去，但他俩还是慢慢地着水离开了。此情此景令他感到分外的孤独和凄凉。他苦苦挣扎一阵之后终于克服了自尊心，向两位伙伴奔过去，大声喊了起来：

“别走，别走！我有话要说！”

两个孩子立即停了下来，转过身。汤姆到了他俩跟前，便透露了自己的秘密。开始时他俩不很乐意地听着，听着听着，听出了其中的“妙处”，不禁鼓掌欢呼起来，说是“太棒了”！还说要是他一开始就说出来，他们是不会走的。他编造了貌似有说服力的理由为自己开脱，但真正的原因是，他生怕连这个秘密也未必能让对方留下来长时间跟他在一起，所以不到万不得已他是不会拿出这一杀手锏的。

几个少年兴高采烈地回转营地，再次尽情嬉戏玩乐，对汤姆了不起的计划赞不绝口，议论不休，说那只能出自天才之手。享用过味美可口的龟蛋和鱼鲜之后，汤姆说，他想学抽烟了。乔一听这主意觉得挺合自己的心意，说他也要试试。于是哈克就做了两只烟斗，装满了烟草。这两位新手过去除了葡萄藤做的烟外，没尝过别的，因而抽起来特别“呛口”，到底缺了点男子汉的气概。

三个人趴在地上，胳膊肘支着身子，战战兢兢地开始吞云吐雾起来。烟味有点辣，抽起来不好受，被呛得喘不过气来，但汤姆还是说：

“哟，学抽烟挺容易的！早知道就这么回事，我早就学会了。”

“我也有同感，”乔说，“算不了什么。”

“我多次见过抽烟的人，心想：‘但愿我也能抽。’可我从没想到自己果然能抽了。”汤姆道。

“我也一个样，是不是，哈克？你有没有听我说过同样的话，哈克？让哈克来说，是不是这样？”

“可不是，多次听你说过。”哈克答道。

“哦，我也一样，”汤姆说，“都说过千百次了。有一回是在屠宰场附近，你记不记得，哈克？我说的时候，鲍勃·唐纳、约翰尼·米勒和杰夫·撒切尔他们几个全在。你记不记得，哈克，我说过这样的话？”

“不错，是这么回事。”哈克答道，“那是我丢了白弹珠的第二天。不对，是前一天。”

“可不是，那天我就跟你说过这话。”汤姆道，“哈克还记得。”

“我相信自己能整天抽着这烟斗，”乔说，“我不会头晕的。”

“我也不会，”汤姆说，“我也可以整天不停地抽，可我敢跟你打个赌，杰夫·撒切尔肯定不成。”

“杰夫·撒切尔！他只要抽上两小口，就会晕头转向。再让他试一次，准有他好看的。”

“我敢说，准够他受的。约翰尼·米勒也一个样——我倒想看看约翰尼·米勒抽一口试试。”

“哦，你说我不想看看吗？”乔说，“我跟你打个赌，约翰尼·米勒再也抽不了烟了。他只要闻到一点烟味，就要了他的命。”

“果真是这样，乔。我说呢，真希望其他的孩子这会儿能看见咱们怎么个抽烟。”

“我也一样！”

“我说，伙计，别再谈这档子事了，等到有那么一天，在他们跟前，我就会找你们，说：‘乔，带烟斗了没有？我想抽一口。’你装得无所谓的样子，漫不经心地说：‘带了。是我那只旧烟斗，另外还有一只。只是烟不怎么好。’我就说：‘哦，没事，只要味儿够烈的就行。’你便掏出两只烟斗，咱俩就从容地点上烟，然后就等着瞧他们那傻样儿！”

“哦，天哪，太棒了，汤姆！我真巴不得现在就见到这场面！”

“我也一样！咱们告诉他们说，我们是在当海盗的时候学会抽烟的，他们不希望跟咱们一起才怪哩！”

“可不是，我估摸着准是这样。我敢说他们准想。”

三个孩子就这么说着话。可不多时，说话的劲头就没了，有一句没一句的，后来慢慢地不吭声了，可越来越频繁地啐起了唾沫星儿，脸颊内成了一座喷泉，舌头底下仿佛成了地窖，储满了泛滥的洪水，怎么也排不干。任他们怎么费劲，还是有一些溢进了喉咙，冷不防紧跟着出来一阵干咳。两个孩子都变得脸色苍白，十分受罪，乔的烟斗也从手指间掉落在地，紧随其后便是汤姆的烟斗。泉水源源不断往嘴里涌，两只水泵不停地往外排，闹得乔有气无力地说：

“我的小刀不见了，我还是去找找的好。”

汤姆的嘴唇哆哆嗦嗦，结结巴巴地说：

“我帮你一起找。你上那边去，我到泉水周围找找去。不，哈克，你用不着去——我俩会找到的。”

哈克听罢又坐了下去。等着他们回来，足足等了一个小时，觉得太无聊，便去找自己的同伴。只见他俩各自待在林子里，相距很远。个个脸色苍白，昏昏沉沉地睡着。种种迹象表明，也许他俩刚才受过一阵苦，这会儿没事了。

当晚晚饭的时候，三个人都不太想说话。饭后，哈克装好自己的烟斗，准备给他俩装烟的时候，他俩一副受屈的模样，忙说：“不必了——晚饭吃了什么东西，这会儿还感到挺不舒服呢。”

乔半夜里醒了过来，把另两个孩子唤醒。空气中有一种沉闷压抑的感觉，似乎预示着要变天了。尽管周围死一般的闷热让人透不过气来，害得三个孩子感到窒息，但他们还是挤在篝火前，以求得到友情和慰藉。他们静静地坐着，紧张地等待着什么。火光照不到的地方，完全被黑夜吞没。不久，划过一道闪光，一时间照亮了枝枝叶叶，刹那间便消失了。过了一会儿，又划过一道闪光，比刚才的还要强。接着又是一道。随后林子里的枝叶间响起低低的呻吟声，几个孩子感到面前掠过一股气息，不禁打了个寒战，以为是夜游神从他们身旁经过。接着是片刻的宁静。之后一道怪异的闪光照得黑夜成了白昼，脚旁远远近近的青草细茎也原形毕露，照出三个孩子苍白受惊的脸庞。当空一声低沉的雷声轰隆隆滚滚而来，又沉闷地消失在远方。一阵冷飕飕的风吹过来，吹得树叶瑟瑟作响，火堆旁的灰烬随之四散飞扬。又一道刺眼的闪光把整个林子照得通亮，紧随而至的是一声炸雷，仿佛在这几个孩子头顶的树梢炸开。过后又是漆黑一片，黑暗中他们吓得抱成了一团。几颗豆大雨点落在了树叶上。

“快，伙计们，快躲到帐篷里去！”汤姆喊道。

几个人赶忙拔腿就跑，黑暗中纷纷被树桩和葡萄藤绊倒，慌乱中几乎找不到正确的方向。可怕的阵风在树木间肆虐，所过之处，呼呼声乍起。眩目的闪电一道连着一道，震耳欲聋的炸雷一声接着一声。倾盆大雨接踵而至，风过处，大地上竖起一道道雨帘。孩子们相互招呼，但越来越响的呼呼风声和隆隆雷声完全淹没了他们的声音。但最终他们还是先后跌跌撞撞躲进了帐篷，又冷又湿，胆战心惊，不过谢天谢地，总算与自己的伙伴在一起了，值得庆幸。即使没有别的声音干扰，这顶又旧又破的帐篷被风刮得哗啦啦响，也害得他们开不了口。狂风越刮越猛，刮得帐篷从固定处脱开，随风飘走。三个孩子手攥着手，踉踉跄跄，夺路逃窜，摔得鼻青脸肿，最后躲进河岸一棵大橡树下。这时候大自然的战斗正酣。闪电一个接一个，把天空照得雪亮。大地上的景物纤毫毕露，树木东倒西斜，河水咆哮，浪花飞溅，一片片随风翻卷的水雾，河对岸轮廓模糊的陡岸，全都在飘浮的乌云和雨雾中若隐若现。每隔一小会儿就有参天大树在战斗中成了牺牲品，噼噼啪啪倒在较年轻的树丛中。此刻，毫不示弱的雷鸣变成了震耳欲聋的爆炸声，吓得人魂飞魄散。疯狂的暴风雨作最后一搏，显示其无可匹敌的威力，大有片刻间把这个岛撕成碎片、付之一炬之势，妄图要水淹树顶，风刮它走，让岛上的生灵顷刻间个个失去听觉。离家出走的幼小之人这时候待在户外，这一夜对于他们来说是何等恐怖！

这场战斗终于结束了。随着种种威胁和咆哮声偃旗息鼓，大自然的威力也败下阵来，大地又恢复了和平。三个孩子诚惶诚恐地又回到营地。他们发现还有些事足可自慰。因为那棵原来作为他们栖身之所的高大梧桐树已被雷电劈倒，当时他们没有待在树下，也算是不幸中的万幸了。

营地被荡涤一空。篝火早被浇灭。他们像同龄的孩子一样，凡事欠考虑，事先没有做好防雨的准备。这时候他们够狼狈的，浑身湿透，冷得厉害，一副无可奈何的模样。不过他们很快发现，原先篝火把挨着的一段木头（木头有一段翘在地面上）烧进去很深，留下一个巴掌大的地方没有被雨淋湿。在他们费尽心机努力下，从挡风的木段下搜集来一些碎屑和树皮，终于又点燃起篝火。添上大量的枯树枝后，篝火终于熊熊燃烧，大家无不欢欣鼓舞。三个孩子烤干了熟火腿，美美地享用起来。吃后，三个人在篝火前坐了下来，把自己夜半的历险大大吹嘘了一番，直到天亮还没睡，因为周围找不到一块干燥的地方睡觉。

阳光悄悄地照在孩子们身上，倦意也随之袭来，他们便出了林子，跑到沙洲上去睡了。很快他们被阳光烤得浑身发烫，便懒洋洋地回去准备早餐。吃了早饭，他们感到头脑麻木，关节僵硬，再一次想家了。汤姆看出了点端倪，便开始设法让这几个海盗快活起来。但是他们对玩弹珠、马戏、游泳什么的都不感兴趣，后来提起了那个天大的秘密才稍稍提振了点士气。趁着他们还有点劲头的时候，汤姆给他们出了个主意。那就是暂时不当海盗，先扮演一会儿印第安人。他们被这一主意吸引住了。很快他们脱光了身上的衣服，全身从头到脚涂上一道道黑泥巴，个个都成了斑马了。他们三个当然全都是酋长，于是便冲进林子，去攻击英国人的聚居区。

后来三个人分成三个敌对的部落，各自设埋伏，喊着令人提心吊胆的战斗声，相互攻击。数不尽的杀戮，千百次的剥头皮，这可是血淋淋的一天，也是他们心满意足的一天。

快到吃晚饭的时候，三个人才回到营地，又饿，又高兴。可是又碰到了难题——敌对的印第安部落没有讲和是不能坐在一起分享吃食的，可讲和之前非得抽一锅讲和烟不可。此外他们没有听说过还有别的办法。三个印第安人中有两个说，想来还是当海盗的好。但既然别无选择，他们只好硬装出高高兴兴的样子，拿来烟斗，按规矩轮流抽了起来。

瞧，他们又为过上了印第安人的生活而沾沾自喜，因为这一来他们到底有所收获。不是吗，他们发现，这一次他们能抽上一会烟儿不必害得非走开去找丢失的小刀不可了。他们没有落到被烟呛得头昏眼花、恶心呕吐的境地。他们可不傻，只要花点力气，是可以抽好烟的。晚饭后，他们用心练习了一阵，结果大获成功。这一夜他们过得可称心如意了。即使让他们剥光六个印第安部落人的头皮，剥了他们身上的皮，也没有这等自豪和快活。我们还是不去打扰他们，任其抽他们的烟，聊他们的天，吹他们的牛吧，因为眼下我们可以暂时不必去理会他们。





第十七章


然而在这个平静小镇子里，同样是星期六下午，并没有往日的欢乐。哈珀夫妇和波莉姨妈一家都陷入悲痛之中，人人都伤心断肠，泪水涟涟。整个村子是一片非同寻常的寂静，虽然平日里这个村子也够宁静的。村民们仍然忙着各自的操心事，但无不显得心不在焉，很少说话，却连连叹息。星期六虽是个假日，可这天对孩子来说，无异像个压在肩头的沉重的负担，无心游戏，慢慢地不玩了。

下午，贝基·撒切尔待在空无一人的学校院子里，闷闷不乐，备感凄凉。这里没有任何东西令她感到安慰。她自言自语起来：

“哦，要是我又能得到他的铜把手，该多好呀！现在我手头没有一件东西可让我想起他来了。”说罢她不禁抽泣了起来。

很快她便不哭了，暗自说道：

“哦，就是在这里。要是能再来一次——我就不会说那样的话了。我永生永世也不会说那样的话了。可他已不在人世，我永远，永远，永远见不到他了。”

一想到这里，她难受得再也待不下去，便眼泪汪汪地走开了。一群汤姆原先的玩伴，有男孩子，也有女孩子，走了过来，站在栅栏前，往里张望，用一种崇敬的语气回忆起，他们最后一次见到汤姆时，汤姆是如何如何表现的情景，以及乔拉拉扯扯过的一些小事（现在可以轻而易举就可看出，他俩的表现竟预示着必然会有可怕的事发生）——每个人都指出当时那两个失踪的孩子说话时所站的确切位置，并补充说：“当时我就是这么站着——跟现在一模一样，你就像那时的他——我离他就这么近——他就这么在笑，当时我浑身产生一种异常的感觉——知道吗，好可怕——我直纳闷：怎么回事？现在我明白了。”

接着围绕最后见到那两个死去孩子的到底是哪个产生了争论。许多人都把这一令人伤感的荣誉归于自己，言之凿凿，但他们提出的证据或多或少是被篡改过的。一旦得出定论，到底是哪个最后见到死者，并跟他俩说过话，那几个幸运儿便自以为了不起，他人对他们自然是另眼相看，羡慕至极。有一名苦命的孩子，他实在拿不出此等荣耀，只好回忆一件往事，以此为豪：

“可不，汤姆·索亚曾揍过我。”

可是这样来夸耀自己的做法并不奏效。大多数孩子都有过这样的经历，这些“壮举”只能使荣誉大为逊色。这群孩子慢慢地走开，对两位逝去的英雄无不怀着敬畏而念念不忘。

第二天上午，主日学校放学的时候，教堂的钟声响起，已不像平日那样悦耳。这是一个宁静的安息日。低沉哀怨的钟声与笼罩大自然的默然的沉思相协调。村民们纷纷聚拢来，在教堂的门厅徘徊一阵，低声交谈着这件伤心事。但教堂内听不到人语声，只有妇女们坐到自己的座位时发出丧服摩擦发出的沙沙声，打破了寂静。大家都记得，小小的教堂从来没来过这么多人，把教堂挤得满满的。最后大家都默默地等待着。期待中的沉默。波莉姨妈进来了，身后跟着锡德和玛丽。哈珀夫妇随后跟着进来。他们全都一身黑衣服。会众们和年迈的牧师都恭恭敬敬地站了起来，直到丧主在前排就座才坐下来。又是一阵寂静，大家都陷入了沉思。偶尔传来压抑着的哭泣声。牧师摊开了双手，开始祈祷。大家唱起了感人至深的圣歌，歌词是：“复活在我，生命亦在我。”

葬礼仪式进行过程中，牧师为死去的孩子描绘出一幅幅图景，说他们是何等的优雅，何等的可爱，他们前途无量，在场的人无不觉得这幅幅图像描绘得恰如其分，只觉得自己过去忽视了他俩，只看到这两个苦命的孩子身上的种种过失和错误，深感沉痛。牧师也列举了两个孩子生前感人的事迹，从中看出他俩具有多么可爱，多么慷慨的品性。在座的人一眼就看出，这些事例又是多么的可爱，多么的高尚。他们不由伤心地回忆起，在这些事发生的时候，却被看成是流氓勾当，该挨鞭子。随着牧师动人的叙述，会众们越来越被感动。最后，他们再也克制不了，不禁与丧主一起哭哭啼啼起来。牧师也情不自禁，在讲坛上抹起了眼泪。

门廊里响起一阵窸窣声，但没人注意到。不一会儿教堂的门嘎吱一声，牧师抬起蒙在手帕里朦胧的泪眼一看，顿时傻了！一双又一双眼睛顺着牧师的目光看了过去。刹那间，所有的会众无不站了起来，呆呆望着三个死了的孩子沿着过道迈步走上前来，领头的是汤姆，随后的是乔和哈克，一身的破衣烂衫，羞羞答答，欲前又止。刚才他们就躲在没人的门廊里，听着为自己的葬礼布道哩！

波莉姨妈、锡德、玛丽和哈珀夫妇各自扑向两个死而复生的孩子，一阵亲吻，害得他俩喘不过气来，嘴里还迭声地发出感恩祷词，可怜的哈克手足无措地待在一边，惶惶不安中不知如何是好，该如何躲开这双双不友好的目光。他犹豫一阵后，想拔腿就跑，可汤姆一把抓住他，说：

“波莉姨妈，这不公平。也该有人见到哈克高兴才是。”

“应该高兴！我见了他就高兴，可怜没娘的孩子！”可波莉姨妈倾注在他身上的爱意却使他更不自在。

突然，牧师扯起了喉咙，高声道：“赞美我主，是他赐福众生——唱吧——虔诚地唱吧！”

于是大家唱了起来。唱着《老百首》10，洪亮的歌声充满了胜利的喜悦，震撼着教堂的屋椽，海盗汤姆·索亚则眼望着四周那些对他羡慕不已的孩子，暗自承认，这是他一生最值得骄傲的时刻。

“被骗上当”的会众陆续从教堂里出来，说是：要是能再次听到今天这样动人的《老百首》，他们心甘情愿再被人愚弄一次。

那天，后来汤姆所挨的耳光和得到的亲吻——数量多寡全由波莉姨妈的心情变化来定——比以往一年所得的还要多。但他判断不了：其中哪种最能表达出对上帝的感恩，哪种是对自己的关爱。





第十八章


这可是汤姆秘而不宣的一大秘密——如何跟自己的海盗弟兄策划一起回家，参加自己的葬礼。星期六向晚时分，他们凭着一根木段，划着水，横渡到了密苏里的岸边，在距离村子六英里的地方上了岸。然后在村子边上的林子里睡了一晚，天快亮的时候悄悄地走街穿巷，到了教堂，在门廊一堆坏长椅上又睡了个回笼觉。

星期一早晨吃早饭的时候，波莉姨妈和玛丽对汤姆疼爱有加，对他有求必应。彼此的话语比平时多了许多。交谈中，波莉姨妈说：

“嗯，我倒不是说，你这次开了个挺漂亮的玩笑，害得大家受了一个星期的罪，你们这几个孩子倒也逍遥自在。你害得我遭了这么大痛苦，也太狠心了，这多遗憾。你既然能凭着一根木头过来参加自己的葬礼，事先就不能给我们透个风，知道你还活着，只是离家跑了？”

“说对了，你原本可以做到的，”玛丽说，“我相信，你要是想到了，会这么做的。”

“是吗，汤姆？”波莉姨妈说，眼睛一亮，面带期待的神情，“要是想到了，你会这么做的，是不是？”

“我，这个——我不知道。那会把事儿全搞砸的。”

“汤姆，我原以为你对我存有很大的孝心，”波莉姨妈说，听口气她很伤心，让汤姆感到很不自在，“你该想到的，想到了即使没有做，我也高兴的。”

“姨妈，反正没造成什么坏后果，”玛丽恳求了起来，“汤姆做事就是这么怪——风风火火，从不思前顾后。”

“这就更令人遗憾了。锡德就会想到。要是锡德，他就会回来，把事儿办妥。汤姆，日后有一天你回想起来，准会后悔的，悔不该没有对我多付出点孝心，这对你来说原本算不了什么。”

“姨妈，从现在起我会对你尽心的。”汤姆说。

“要是真的说到做到，最好不过了。”

“要是当时我这么想就好了，”汤姆带着悔恨的口气说，“可我到底梦见过你。这也算是我的一份心吧，是不是？”

“这算不了什么——猫也会做梦哩。不过好歹比什么也没有表示强。你都梦见了什么？”

“可不是，星期三晚上我梦见你就坐在床边，锡德坐在木箱子旁，旁边坐着玛丽。”

“还真有那么回事。我们老这么坐着。你在梦里如此为我们操心，我很高兴。”

“我还梦见乔·哈珀的娘也在这里。”

“可不是，她是在这里！你还梦见别的没有？”

“梦见了许多许多。只是现在记不清了。”

“使劲想想——行吗？”

“好像风就那么吹着——吹着——吹在——”

“再使劲想想，汤姆！风确实吹灭了什么，接着想想！”

汤姆手指儿摁在脑门上，苦苦地思索了片刻后，说：

“想起来了——想起来了！风把蜡烛吹灭了。”

“天哪！接着想，汤姆——接着想！”

“我好像记得你说：‘怎么啦，我相信门——’”

“说下去，汤姆！”

“让我想想——只一会儿。哦，是的，你说，你相信门开着。”

“说我这么坐着，没错。我是坐着！是这样吗，玛丽？说下去！”

“后来——后来，我不敢肯定，后来你像是让锡德去——去——”

“去什么——去什么？我让他去干什么，汤姆？我让他去干什么？”

“你让他——你——让他去关门！”

“老天爷！我这辈子还没听说这档子怪事儿。谁说梦中的不能当真？我这就把这奇事跟塞拉尼·哈珀说道说道。她老说什么迷信不迷信一类的废话，这回我倒要她解释解释。接着说下去，汤姆！”

“现在我全记得一清二楚了。接着，你说我不坏，只是太淘气了点，不守规矩，冒冒失失的，说我到底——嗯，说我还是个毛孩子，能负多少责任呢？”

“是这么说！没错。接着说，汤姆！”

“后来你哭哭啼啼起来了。”

“我哭了。是哭了。还不是第一次哭呢。后来——”

“后来哈珀太太，她也哭了起来。她说了乔同样的话。说她悔不该怪乔偷吃了奶酪，用鞭子抽了他一顿，事实是她自己扔掉——”

“汤姆！你果真是神灵附身哪！你这是未卜先知——是这么回事！上帝显灵了！——接着说下去，汤姆！”

“后来锡德说——他说——”

“我以为我什么也没说。”锡德道。

“不对，你说了，锡德。”玛丽道。

“闭嘴，让汤姆接着说！他说了什么，汤姆？”

“他说——我想他说但愿我在另一个世界日子过得更舒坦，不过要是行为检点些——”

“可不是，这都是你亲耳听到的？他说的正是这话。”

“你还狠狠训了他呢。”

“我打赌，我是训了他。当时准有个天使在场。准有个天使藏在哪里。”

“哈珀太太还说到乔放爆竹吓了她的事。你说了彼得和止痛药——”

“明镜似的，丝毫不差！”

“后来又说了一大堆话，有关在河上如何打捞我，如何准备在星期日办葬礼。你和哈珀太太还抱在一起痛哭流涕哩。后来她走了。”

“跟你说的一模一样！一模一样。汤姆，就算你亲眼看见了，也说不出比这更准确的了。后来呢？接着说，汤姆！”

“后来，我想，你为我做了祷告——你的一举一动我全看到了，你说的话我全听到了。接着你去睡了，我呢，觉得很难过，便拿来一片梧桐叶，在上面写了这几个字：‘我们没有死——我们只是出去当海盗了。’写完了，就把梧桐叶放到桌子上蜡烛的旁边。后来我看你睡着了，气色挺不错，便弯下身子，在你的嘴唇上亲了亲。”

“是吗，汤姆，是这样吗？冲着这一点，不管你干了什么事，我全都宽恕你。”她说罢一把把这孩子紧紧搂在怀中，害得汤姆只觉得自己一下子成了罪恶滔天的大混蛋。

“这倒挺不赖，可惜只是一场梦。”锡德暗自嘟嘟哝哝，声音低得勉强能听到。

“住嘴，锡德！一个人醒着的时候也会做梦中做过的事。汤姆，这只大苹果是我专为你留着的，是我省下的，要是还能找到你——好啦，上学去吧。你到底回到我们身边了，这得感谢上帝的赐福，我们虽然长时间担惊受怕过，但圣父对那些相信上帝并听从他的话的人是仁慈的，只是天知道，我还不配上帝的赐福。但是如果只有配得上的人才能得到他的保佑渡过难关，那今天在这里欢笑的人、黑夜来临时，在他怀抱里安睡的人就寥寥无几了。去吧，锡德，玛丽，汤姆——上学去吧。你们耽误我太久了。”

三个孩子上学去后，老太太便去拜访哈珀太太，要用汤姆的奇妙的梦境征服对方的现实。锡德心里很清楚，知道是怎么回事，只是没直接说出来。离开家后，他认为：“这么长的梦，居然没半点差错，可能吗？”

现在汤姆成了个大英雄了！他走起路来不再蹦蹦跳跳，而是大摇大摆，神气活现，活像个海盗，成了个众人注目的人物了。他摆出的确实是这一副架势。他显得旁若无人，对人似乎视而不见，对人家的议论装作充耳不闻，可人家的举动正中下怀，心里乐开了花。比他小的孩子紧紧跟着他，觉得与他在一起自己也沾了光，受了委屈也沾沾自喜，汤姆就像是游行队伍的领队鼓手，要么就是马戏团进城时领头的大象。和他一样大的孩子装作压根不知道他出走过，可心里对他羡慕不已。要是能有一身汤姆那样被阳光晒得黝黑的皮肤，以及他那耀眼的名声，付出一切代价在所不惜。汤姆呢，要是让他拿出这两件宝贝中的一件去换进马戏团，他也心甘情愿。

在学校里，汤姆和乔引起了很大的轰动。人人眼里无不流露出深深的崇敬之情，两位英雄很快就变得令人难受的傲慢。他俩对那些如饥似渴的听众大讲其讲自己的历险——那还只是他们历险的开端，有意思的还多着呢，因为凭他们的想象力，在自己的素材中可以不断添油加醋的。最后，当他俩拿出烟斗，怡然自得地四处吞云吐雾的时候，他们的荣耀才达到登峰造极。

汤姆认定，现在他用不着理睬贝基·撒切尔了。有了这身荣誉他就心满意足了。他要为荣誉而活。既然现在他已是大名鼎鼎了，也许她想跟他“言归于好”。得了，看她怎么办吧——她会看到，他像其他人一样，会表现得若无其事的。不久她来了。汤姆装作没看见她。他转身跟一班男女孩子在一起，聊起了天。他很快注意到，她涨红着脸，高高兴兴地东跑西转，眼睛瞟来瞟去，装作跟一班同学追追赶赶，抓到了人，又是笑又是叫的。不过他注意到，她每次总是在他身旁不远处抓到人的，这时候，她就有意识地朝他这个方向瞥上一眼。这让他那不端的虚荣心得到了充分满足，因而她非但没有得到他的好感，反而让他“鼻子翘得更高”，更加克制着自己，故意不去注意她的存在。不一会儿，她再也没劲唧唧喳喳嬉闹下去，而是迟迟疑疑转悠起来，叹息一两声，朝汤姆偷偷看上一眼。她发现，汤姆老跟艾米·劳伦斯说话，说得比谁都多。她感到一阵钻心的疼痛，立刻变得焦躁不安起来。她很想这就走开，可两腿就是不听她使唤，反而挪步向那帮人过去。她就对一个在紧挨汤姆身边的女孩子说——装着快快活活的样子：

“听我说，玛丽·奥斯丁！你是个坏孩子，干吗不上主日学校？”

“我去了——你没见到我？”

“没有！你去了？你坐在哪个位置？”

“我在彼得斯小姐那个班。我总是去那个班。我可见到你了。”

“是吗？怪哩，我可没见到你。我本想跟你说说野餐的事儿。”

“这可是挺开心的事儿。是哪个来主办的？”

“我妈妈让我来办。”

“啊，太棒了！我希望她也让我参加。”

“她会的。这可是一次为我举办的野餐会。谁想来都可以来。我也乐意你来。”

“再好没有了！定在什么时候？”

“不会太久，兴许在放假前后吧。”

“太有意思了！你把所有的男孩子和女孩子全请了去？”

“是的，是我的朋友，要么愿意做我朋友的人，都请了去。”她说着，眼角偷偷瞟了汤姆一眼，可他还是跟艾米·劳伦斯起劲说着岛上那场可怕的暴风雨，说着闪电如何把那棵梧桐树“撕成碎片”，那时他离那树只有“三英尺”。

“哦，我可以去吗？”格雷斯·米勒问。

“行。”

“我呢？”问话的是萨莉·罗杰斯。

“行。”

“我也能去吗？”苏珊·哈珀问，“还有乔呢？”

“行。”

等等，等等，几个姑娘听了乐得拍起掌来，最后除了汤姆和艾米，所有的人都说要去，并获得同意。汤姆若无其事地领着艾米，说说笑笑，转身离去。这时候贝基嘴唇哆嗦，泪水夺眶而出。但她还是强自忍着痛苦，装得高高兴兴的样子，继续跟别人说话。此时此刻，野餐和其他的一切一切，早已丧失其生活的乐趣。她很快便转身走了，找了个地方，像姑娘们常说的，“痛哭它一场”。哭罢，她闷闷不乐地坐下来，只觉得自尊心深受伤害。她坐了很久，听到上课的铃声响起，才站了起来，怀着复仇的目光，甩了甩自己的长辫子，说了句：她知道该怎么办。

课间休息的时候，汤姆继续跟艾米亲热，开开心心，自得其乐。他到处找贝基，想方设法去伤害贝基。他终于看到她了，可是那股得意劲却没了踪影。只见她舒舒服服地坐在教室后面的小长凳上，跟艾尔弗莱德·坦布尔一起看图画书。两个人看得着了迷，两个脑袋挨得很近很近，像是除了图画书，他俩忘了世界上还有别的什么了。汤姆浑身充满了深深的妒意。他恨自己怎么错过贝基用来表示和解的大好机会。他称自己是傻瓜，把自己骂了个狗血喷头。他气得想大喊大叫它一场。这时候艾米就在他身边，走着走着，絮絮叨叨个不停，她正兴高采烈着哩，可汤姆的舌头却不灵了。他连艾米说些什么也没听进去，遇到艾米停下来等着他反应的时候，他只能结结巴巴地有一句没一句来应付，结果往往完全错会了她的意思。他不断往教室后面去，来来去去，那边可恨的场面令他眼珠子都冒火了。他已忍无可忍。他以为，他已发现贝基·撒切尔认为世上压根就没他这人，这让他简直发了疯。不过其实她看到他了，而且知道自己已胜券在握，看到他像她刚才那样也在活受罪，让她十分高兴。

身边艾米兴高采烈的絮叨叫他不堪忍受。汤姆暗示她，他得去办一件事，一件非办不可的事，而且延误不得。可没用——这姑娘还是叽叽咕咕个没完没了。汤姆心想：“该死，我就摆脱不了她吗？”最后他终于等到了去办那件非办不可的事的时候了。可她还不知趣地说，放学后她就在附近等着他。他拔腿跑了开去，恨死了她。

“谁都可以，”汤姆咬牙切齿地说，“全镇所有的男孩子，除了那个来自圣路易的自以为了不起的家伙，他以为自己穿得体面，就是上等人了！哦，不是吗，你来镇子的第一天，我就赏你一顿好揍了，小子。现在我又想揍你了！等着瞧吧，只要我逮到了机会，我就要——”

他设想着如何揍那个想象中的男孩子——对空做出了拳打脚踢、抠起了人家的眼睛等种种动作来，嘴里嚷嚷着：“你尝到滋味了吧？够你受的了吧，是不是？这下你学乖了吧！”这一场想象中的搏斗以汤姆心满意足而告终。

中午汤姆溜回了家。艾米那种自我陶醉的快乐叫他受不了，而满腹的醋意折磨得他苦不堪言。贝基再次跟艾尔弗莱德一起看起了图画书。可是苦等苦熬了好一会儿，都不见汤姆过来领罪。她的得意劲蒙上了阴影，再也没了兴趣。随之而来的却是心情沉重，茫然不知所措，最后落得闷闷不乐的境地。她三两次竖起耳朵，实指望能听到脚步声，到头来还是希望落空。汤姆没有来。最后她感到伤心至极，后悔自己刚才做得太过分了。可怜的艾尔弗莱德觉察到对方对自己失去了兴趣，却不知到底为了什么，一个劲地嚷嚷：“哦，这画多棒！瞧哪！”最后她被搅得好不耐烦，说：“哦，别来烦我！我没兴趣！”说罢眼泪汪汪，起身走掉。

艾尔弗莱德走过去，想安慰她。她说：

“走开，让我一个人待着，行吗？我讨厌你！”

这男孩子停下脚步，直纳闷自己到底做错了什么了——刚才她还说，整个中午她都要看图画书的——她离开了，边走边哭。艾尔弗莱德茫然不解地进了空无一人的教室。他感到又羞辱又气愤。他不费吹灰之力就猜出了其中的因由——这女孩子纯粹是拿他当出气筒，把原本发在汤姆·索亚身上的怨气发泄到了自己头上了。一想到这里，他对汤姆更加愤恨了。他希望能想出一个办法，给汤姆吃点苦头，而自己用不着冒什么风险。他一眼就看到了汤姆的拼写课本。机会来了。他高兴地把书翻到了下午要上的那一页，在上面倒了些墨水。

这时候贝基正好在他身后的窗外往里看，见了这情景，转身就走，没有被对方发现。她离开学校，想去找汤姆，把这事告诉他。汤姆听了一定对她感激不尽的，他俩的别扭就此便烟消云散了。她刚走到半路，忽又改变了主意。一想起刚才说到野餐时汤姆对自己的态度，心头火辣辣的发痛，又羞又气。她决心让他因拼写课本沾上墨水挨一顿揍，而且要恨他一辈子。





第十九章


汤姆回到家，情绪糟糕透了。姨妈对他说的第一句话说明，在这里他的伤心是没人理会的。

“汤姆，我真想活剥你的皮。”

“姨妈，我做错了什么？”

“得了，你干的好事还少吗？我像个老傻瓜跑去找塞拉尼·哈珀，实指望让她相信你那些鬼话。可你瞧，她从乔那里听说你曾来过这里，把那天晚上我们说的话全听了去。汤姆，我不知道，能干出这种事的孩子，将来会变成什么样子。一想到你居然让我上塞拉尼·哈珀家出丑，自己却一声不吭，我难受极了。”

汤姆可没想到这一层。此前，汤姆只认为自己是耍点小聪明，开个玩笑，还觉得挺巧妙哩。现在看来这玩笑挺卑劣、挺肮脏的。他耷拉下脑袋，一时间说不出话来。过了一会儿他才说：

“姨妈，我悔不该干出这事儿——可当时没有想过会这样的。”

“哦，孩子，你从来就不用脑子，除了自己，你从来就不想想别的。你可以想到夜里从杰克逊岛一路过来，为的就是笑话我们。你可以拿梦来糊弄我，可你压根就不想想同情我们，不让我们伤心。”

“姨妈，现在我知道了，我的行为很缺德，可我并不存心缺德。说实在话，不是的。再说，那天晚上我来这里也不是为了看你的笑话。”

“那你回来干吗？”

“我是想来告诉你们，别为我们操心，因为我们没有在河里淹死。”

“汤姆，汤姆，要是你真的这么好心想过，那就谢天谢地了。可你压根没有想过——我知道你没有想过，汤姆。”

“真的，姨妈，我真的想过——要是我没有想过，让我立刻死去得了。”

“哦，汤姆，别撒谎——别撒谎了。那只会让事糟糕一百倍。”

“我没撒谎，姨妈，我说的是实话。我是想让你们别再伤心——我就是为了这个回来的。”

“要是我让天底下的人都相信你的这番话，那我简直是在掩盖天大的罪孽了。相比之下，反倒为你这么跑出去胡闹一阵感到高兴哩。可你说的这番话很没有道理，要不然你干吗没跟我说呢，孩子？”

“是这么回事，姨妈。就在你们谈论如何举办丧礼的时候，我满脑子净想着怎么赶回来，躲在教堂里，这么着就把事儿搞砸了。最后我把树皮往口袋一塞，什么话也没留下，走了。”

“什么树皮？”

“我在上面写着我们要当海盗的那块树皮。现在想来，当时要是在我亲你的时候，你就醒过来，那有多好——真的，我说的是真话。”

老太太一脸严肃的皱纹舒展开来，刹那间，眼睛里流露出慈祥的神情。

“你亲过我了，汤姆？”

“可不是，亲过。”

“当真亲过，汤姆？”

“可不是，亲过，姨妈——当真亲过。”

“你干吗亲我，汤姆？”

“因为我非常非常爱你，看着你躺在那里老哼哼的，我心里别提多难受了。”

这话听来倒是真话。老太太掩饰不住内心的感动，声音颤抖，接口说：

“再亲我一次，汤姆！这就上学去，别再给我添烦恼了。”

他走后，她到了衣柜前，从中拿出汤姆玩海盗游戏时穿过的外衣，衣服破破烂烂。她突然住了手，自言自语起来：

“不，我没勇气看。可怜的孩子。我琢磨着，他又没说实话。不过他的这番谎话出自善意，令人宽慰。但愿上帝——我知道，上帝会宽恕他的，因为他编造了这些话，用心良苦。这番谎言我不想戳穿。衣服我不看了。”

她把那件外衣放回柜子，沉思了片刻，又先后两次伸手去拿那外衣，但都把手缩回。最后她还是鼓起勇气，伸出手。这一次她找到了理由，决心更大了。她心想：“这是个善良的谎言——善良的谎言——我不会因此而伤心的。”她摸了摸那外衣的口袋，很快就摸到了树皮，她含着泪看着树皮，说：“现在就算他犯百万次罪，我也能原谅他了！”





第二十章


波莉姨妈的态度变得很神奇，她吻了汤姆一下，汤姆的低沉情绪便一扫而光，又变得轻松愉快起来了。他去上学，幸运的是居然在芳草巷口遇到了贝基·撒切尔。他的情绪始终决定他的一举一动。他毫不犹豫跑到她跟前，说：

“今天我的行为太不地道了，贝基，请你原谅。这辈子我不再这样了——咱们和好吧，行不行？”

这女孩子停住了脚步，面带鄙夷的神色看着他，说：

“你能自个儿待着去，我就感谢不尽了，托马斯·索亚先生。我再也不跟你搭腔了。”

她把脑袋一甩，走了过去。他愣了，来不及回她一句“谁稀罕，神气的小姐”，人早走了。所以他什么话也没说，可心里那个火哪，就甭提了。他拖着脚步进了学校，心里想象着：要是她是个男孩，他就如何如何痛打她一顿的。不一会儿，他再次遇到了她，从她身边经过时，他说了一句刻薄的话，她也回敬了一句。于是两人的关系就彻底完了。贝基这时候正在气头上，迫不及待地盼着快点开课，好让汤姆早些为弄脏的拼写课本挨罚。如果说此前她还为要不要揭发艾尔弗莱德·坦布尔而犹豫不决，那么汤姆方才的冷嘲热讽逼得她彻底打消了揭发的念头。

可怜的姑娘，她还不知道自己这就要遭罪了。他们的老师杜宾斯先生人到中年，郁郁不得志。他一心盼着当一名医生，可为贫穷所迫，不得不去做一名乡村学校的老师。每天只要用不着听学生背课文的时候，他都从书桌取出一本神秘的书，埋头看起来。他向来把书紧紧锁起来，学校里的淘气鬼谁都想看看，哪怕是看一眼这本书，可就是没机会。这到底是本什么样的书，不论是男生，还是女生，都有一套说法，各有不同。可是就是得不到事实的真相。那张书桌就摆放在门边，贝基从旁经过时，发现钥匙竟插在锁上！真是千载难逢的机会。她打量四周，除了她没别的人，紧接着那书就到了她的手。书的扉页上写着：《某教授的解剖学》，可她不懂这几个字是什么意思，所以便翻起了书。很快就翻到一张卷首的精美彩色插图——一张人体图，全身一丝不挂。就在这时候，一个人影落在书页上，是汤姆·索亚进了门，也瞟见了那张画。贝基急忙把书合上，倒运的是把那画撕破了一半。她把书塞回了书桌，锁上，又羞又恼地哭喊起来。

“汤姆·索亚，你偷偷摸摸站在人家身后，偷看人家看的东西，卑鄙得不能再卑鄙了！”

“我怎么知道你在看东西？”

“你该感到害羞才是，汤姆·索亚。你会告发我的，哦，我如何是好，如何是好！我准要挨鞭子了，可我从没在学校里挨过鞭子。”

接着她的小脚儿一跺，又说了起来：

“要是你想做个卑鄙的人，做去吧！我知道迟早会有这么一天的。你等着瞧吧！我恨你，恨你，恨你！”她说罢，冲出了教室，又是一阵哭哭啼啼。

汤姆呆呆地站在那儿，被这一番辱骂搞得不知所措。过了一会儿他自言自语道：

“多怪的傻姑娘。说什么在学校里没挨过鞭子哩！嘿，挨鞭子算得了啥？真是姑娘家，皮薄胆又小。当然咯，我不会向老杜宾斯告发这个小傻瓜的，因为有的是别的办法治她，用不着这么卑鄙。可什么办法呢？老杜宾斯会问，哪个撕了他的书。没人会招认。那他就会按老方法，一个挨一个问，等问到干这事的姑娘，他就会知道，用不着再问下去了。女孩子的秘密就写在自己的脸上，她们可都是些软骨头。那她就要挨揍了。这下贝基·撒切尔可就没好果子吃，过不了这一关。”汤姆心里算计了一会儿，接着说，“不过，这也好。她不是巴望着我碰上这种倒霉的事吗——让她也受点罪吧。”

汤姆出了教室到外面去跟一班学生玩儿去了。不久，老师来上课了。汤姆对功课并不那么感兴趣。只要他朝女孩子那边偷眼望去，每见到贝基就让他心烦。想起发生过的种种事，怎么也不让汤姆对贝基生出同情心来。他呢，能做的只有这些，不值得得意。接着他发现自己的拼写课本被弄脏了，好一会儿，他忙着自己的烦恼事，顾不了其他了。这时，贝基已从茫然而痛苦中摆脱出来，兴致勃勃地注意事态的发展。她预料，汤姆即使不承认自己弄脏了课本，也会吃不了兜着走的。她想得没错。他越是不承认，情况越糟。贝基觉得，自己会因此而高兴的，她相信自己会这样的。可结果她发现自己居然做不到。当事情发展到糟得不能再糟的时候，她只感到一阵冲动，要站起来告发艾尔弗莱德·坦布尔了。但是她还是竭力控制住了自己，保持沉默，因为，她心想：“他肯定要把我撕书的事说出来的，我也一个字不说，不来救他！”

汤姆挨了鞭子后回到自己的座位上，丝毫也不伤心。他认为，很可能是自己在和同学闹着玩的时候，无意中打翻了墨水瓶，弄脏了课本——他刚才嘴上是没有承认，那是因为这是惯例，坚决不承认可是原则问题。

慢慢地过去了一个小时，老师坐在自己的宝座上打盹。教室里嗡嗡读书声催人入眠。不一会儿，杜宾斯先生坐直了身子，打了个呵欠，打开抽屉，伸手去拿书，可拿不定主意，该拿还是不拿。多数孩子都懒洋洋地抬起头看了看他，但有两个孩子却紧张地盯着他的举动。杜宾斯先生心不在焉地用手摸了一会儿书，拿出了书，在椅子里坐定后，看起了书！汤姆飞速瞥了贝基一眼。他曾见过一只被追逐的野兔，猎枪直瞄准它的脑袋，已无生路，跟贝基这时的神色一模一样。汤姆顿时忘了跟她争吵的事。快，得赶紧采取措施！说干就干！可情急之下，他平时那机灵劲不知哪里去了，他呆呆地浑身都麻木了。好哩，他灵机一动，要跑过去一把抢来书，然后冲出门逃之夭夭！可片刻间他的决心动摇了，从而失去了机会——老师打开了书。要是这良机失而复得该多好！可惜太迟了。他说，贝基这下在劫难逃了。接着老师转身面对全班同学。在他逼视下，人人都垂下了眼皮。面对他那目光，即使是无辜的人也感到害怕。教室里一片肃静，一，二，三……足足延续了十秒钟之久。老师也在鼓足狠劲，怒气冲冲问：

“书是哪个撕的？”

谁也不吭声。静得掉下一根针也能听到。还是寂静。老师察看每张脸，想发现犯罪的痕迹。

“本杰明·罗杰斯，是你撕的书吗？”

得到的是否认。停顿了一会儿。

“约瑟夫·哈珀，是你吗？”

又是否认。审问慢慢进行下去，这过程折磨得汤姆越来越难受。老师的目光从一排排男生脸上掠过，想了想，转向女生：

“艾米·劳伦斯，是你？”

对方摇了摇头。

“格雷斯·米勒，是你？”

同样的反应。

“苏珊·哈珀，是你撕的？”

还是否认。下一个是贝基·撒切尔。汤姆激动得从头到脚哆嗦起来。看来她在劫难逃了。

“丽贝卡·撒切尔——”（汤姆看了一眼她的面孔，那脸已吓得一片苍白）“是你撕了——不，看着我的脸——”（眼看她举起双手求饶了）“是你撕了这书？”

汤姆的脑袋里灵光一闪，想出了主意。他跳起身，大声道：“是我撕的！”

全班同学瞪大眼睛，看着这个不可思议的愚蠢家伙。汤姆默默地站了好一会儿，让自己镇定下来，然后迈步向前走去接受惩罚。可怜的贝基眼里所流露出来的惊讶、感激、崇敬神色他一一感受得到，即使挨一百鞭子也在所不惜。杜宾斯先生手下毫不留情，这是一次前所未有的残酷鞭刑，但在自己壮举的鼓舞下，汤姆没有发出一声喊声。此外他还满不在乎地接受了另一项残酷的惩罚，命令他放学后在学校里留两小时——因为他知道，谁会在外面等着他“刑满释放”，也不会把这两小时看作是一大损失，过得枯燥乏味。

当天晚上去睡觉的时候，汤姆算计着如何报复艾尔弗莱德·坦布尔，因为贝基又害羞又悔恨地把一切全告诉了他，也忘不了自己的背叛行径。但是渴望如何报复之后，很快便想起了种种开心的事，最后也就入睡了，但梦乡里耳边还响着贝基临走时说过的话：

“汤姆，你怎么这么高尚！”





第二十一章


学校就要放假了。这位老师向来很严厉，现在变得更严厉，更吹毛求疵了，因为他想让全班学生在考试日这一天好好表现自己。现在他的教鞭和戒尺难得空闲的时候——至少在年龄较小的孩子是如此。只有十八到二十岁的男孩子和姑娘才能逃过这一劫。而且杜宾斯先生鞭打起人来那才叫狠。他虽然戴着假发，脑袋光秃秃的，亮晶晶的。他已届中年，肌肉却不见有丝毫衰弱的迹象。随着这重大的日子临近，他的残暴性子便暴露无遗了。人家稍有差错，他就要鞭子相加，惩罚中似乎获得莫大的乐趣。结果是，年龄小的学生，白天里受尽折磨，痛苦不堪，夜晚就算计着如何报复老师，他们殚精竭虑，不失时机给老师制造麻烦，可他每每高人一筹。学生们每次报复的后果都是受到凶残狠毒的惩罚，学生们无不以惨败而告终。最后他们集思广益，一起谋划出一种保证能取得辉煌战果的方案。他们让一位招牌油漆匠的儿子入伙，把方案告诉了他，求得他的帮助。这个方案正中招牌油漆匠儿子的下怀。他也有自己的理由，因为这位老师就在他父亲家寄宿，害得这孩子有充分的理由恨他。老师的妻子几天之后就要来村子探亲，到时候就万无一失了。每逢重大日子，老师往往把自己灌得烂醉。招牌油漆匠的儿子说，考试的那天晚上，等这先生醉到一定程度，他一准在老师坐在椅子打盹的时候把事“搞定”，然后夜里他瞅准机会设法弄醒他，让他匆匆忙忙往学校赶。

有趣的日子终于如期而至。晚上八点钟，教室里灯火通明，绿叶和鲜花编织成的花环和彩饰点缀其间，这位老师就端坐在高台上的宝座上，他身后放着一块黑板。他看上去已有几分醉意，他的左右是三排长凳，前方则是六排椅子，坐着镇上的显要和学生家长。他的左边，市民席的后方临时搭着个宽敞台子，上面坐着的是当晚应试的小学生。一排排男孩子被洗刷得干干净净，穿戴得齐齐整整，觉得好不别扭。那些大男孩呢，则傻傻地坐着。小姑娘和年轻的女士身穿细麻布和平纹细布衣衫，白白的，像一大堆雪堆，挤挨在一起，显然为自己裸露的胳膊、为祖母辈留下的老式小首饰、为身上粉红色和蓝色的饰带及插在头上的花而显得羞羞答答。教室里其余的部分则被不参加考试的学生挤得满满当当。

考试开始了。一名年龄很小的男孩子站了起来，羞怯怯地背起“你们不大会想到，像我这么小年龄的孩子会站在讲台上当众讲话”等等，伴着背诵声，他还做出一些精确异常、抽风似的手势，活像是被机器操纵着的——这机器可能还出了点故障。不过，尽管他一直战战兢兢，还是完成了使命，在满场热烈的掌声中，他做作地鞠了一躬，退场。

一位满脸羞涩的小姑娘，含含糊糊地朗诵完“玛丽有只小羊羔”，等等，行了个招人怜爱的屈膝礼，博得一片应得的掌声，红着脸蛋，高高兴兴地坐了下去。

汤姆·索亚显得很自负，信心十足地走上前去，背诵起那气势磅礴、遗世万年的《不自由，毋宁死》的演讲11。他满腔激情，慷慨激昂地打着手势，可只背了一半，背不下去了，原来他犯了可怕的怯场症，害得他两腿打战，几乎喘不过气来。他明显地博得全场的同情——但也造成了冷场，这比同情还要糟。老师皱起了眉头，这无异变成了一场大灾难。汤姆挣扎了一番之后，只得退场，落得彻底失败的下场。有人勉强鼓了几声掌，但掌声很快就销声匿迹了。

接下去的节目是《小男孩站在燃烧的甲板上》《亚述人来了》等一些名篇的朗诵。然后是朗读测试和拼写比赛。拉丁文班寥寥几个学生的朗诵倒也获得满堂彩。接下去是当晚最出色的节目——年轻姑娘的创意“作文”。轮到的人来到讲台边，清清嗓子，捧起稿子（稿子都用鲜艳的缎带系着）朗读起来，在表情和抑扬顿挫上煞是卖力。文章的题材陈旧，出不了其母亲、祖母辈的窠臼，甚至可追溯到十字军12时代。其中有“友谊”啦，“忆往昔”啦，“历代宗教”啦，“梦乡”啦，“文化之优越性”啦，“政治统治之对比和比较”啦，“愁思”啦，“孝道”啦，“心向往之”啦，等等，不一而足。

这些文章最大的特点就是：矫揉造作的忧伤，及“华丽辞藻”的过度堆砌，加上死搬硬套一些时髦词语，不把它们用滥死不罢休。此外还有一个显著的标志性的特点，使得朗诵大为逊色，那就是篇篇文章的结尾无不充斥着陈腐而令人生厌的说教，就像拖着根残缺不全的尾巴甩来晃去。无论文章标榜的是什么题目，总是煞费苦心扯上种种说教，想让那些道学家和宗教家从中有所教益。这些说教虽然明知是言不由衷，他们至今在学校里仍旧大行其道，还不足以把它们从学校里清除出去。也许只要这个世界还存在，它们仍有市场。我们国家的每所学校里，年轻的姑娘们无不觉得但凡作文，非要来这么一段说教不可。诸位会发现，学校里那些最轻浮、宗教意识最薄弱的姑娘的作文里，说教往往是最长的，显得最虔诚的。不过，这些事也不必多费唇舌了。反正大实话人家是不爱听的。还是转而谈谈“考试”的事吧。应试者朗诵的第一篇作文题为：《那么，难道这就是生活吗？》。我这里且引一两个片段，或许诸位能耐心听一听吧：

在日常生活中，年轻人始终怀着喜悦的心情，憧憬着喜庆节日的欢乐场景。他们在想象中描绘出的是玫瑰色的欢快画面。在幻觉里，沉湎于追逐时尚的人把自己看作是节日人群中“众人注目的人物”。她优美的形体、雪白的衣裾，在翩翩起舞的欢乐的人群中，悄然独立，她的明眸灿灿然，她的舞步最为轻盈。时间在这样美妙的幻境中飞速流逝，于是她进入梦寐以求的极乐世界。在她那五彩缤纷的梦境中，这就是爱丽丝梦游过的童话的世界。在她看来，一切都是那样的赏心悦目，引人入胜！一处更胜另一处。但不久之后，她发现，无非是镜中花，水中月，徒有其表，虚空一场。曾使她昏昏然的甜言蜜语变成刺耳的噪音。舞厅失去其魅力。她劳精耗神，心力交瘁，转身离去，因为现在她深信，世俗的欢娱满足不了灵魂的需求！

如此这般，等等。朗读过程中，不时响起赞许的嗡嗡声，伴之低声的赞叹：“多甜美！”“好有说服力！”“太对了！”等等。在文章以一大段令人难堪的说教结束时，人们报以热烈的掌声。

接着一位身材苗条、神情忧郁的女生站了起来，由于长期服药和消化不良，她的脸白得“有趣”。她朗诵了一首诗。且引它两段足矣：



密苏里少女作别亚拉巴马

再见，亚拉巴马！我非常爱你！

现在我要离去，暂且与你分离。

忧伤，是的，我把思念藏在心底，

燃烧的记忆活跃在我的眼眉！

我曾徘徊在你鲜花盛开的林地，

在塔巴波萨溪畔漫步，读书，

倾听过塔拉瑟的急流的呢喃。

驻足库萨山坡，欢呼它的黎明。

我虽羞愧，却丢不下满腹的愁肠，

满含泪水，转身离去，并不脸红。

我知道离别的不是陌生的土地，

我的叹息也不留给陌生之人。

这个国家热情好客，也有我的家，

我离别它的山谷——也告别山巅。

当我与你以僵冷的眼睛相对，亚拉巴马，

那时我的双眼、心脏已经死亡。

在场的人未必都听懂诗中每个词句，但大家都听得津津有味。

接着上场的是位黑皮肤、黑眼睛、黑头发年轻姑娘，她上得台来，略停片刻，创造了良好的氛围，然后带着悲怆的表情，以颇有分寸的语调朗诵了起来：



幻境

漆黑的夜，风雨交加。高高的苍穹几乎不见星星踪影。低沉的雷声不绝于耳。摄人心魄的闪电愤怒地在乌云密布的天穹施虐，像是不把英名显赫的富兰克林13对它倒行逆施所施加的威力放在眼里！甚至狂风也神秘地倾巢而出，给这张狂雷电助威呐喊。

就在这样的时刻，在如此黯黑、恐怖的夜晚，出于对人类的同情，我的灵魂只能发出声声叹息，但是，此外：

我最亲密的朋友，我的顾问，我的安慰者，我的领路人，我悲伤中的欢乐，我欢乐中的又一个极乐，来到我的身旁。

她就像那些浪漫年轻人笔下的天使，在想象中的伊甸园漫步，沐浴在阳光下，步履轻盈，美如皇后，除了自身的美貌，用不着任何雕饰。她举步轻盈，悄然无声。她像其他美女一样，经她亲切温柔地抚摸，令人激动销魂，她也会从你身边飘然而过，不为人知，不引人追逐。她脸上露出的愁意，就像是冬季之神长袍上凝结着的泪花。她手指户外搏斗中的暴风雨，令我思索其间的深意。

这篇噩梦般的文字足有十页之多，结尾处的说教摧毁了非长老会教徒所有的希望，因而获得了头奖。这篇作文被誉为当晚最出色的作品，村长在给该文作者的颁奖辞热情洋溢，说这是他闻所未闻的最感人的文章，连丹尼尔·韦伯斯特14都很可能引以为豪。

顺便提一句，那种滥用“美丽”一词、爱把人生经历比作“生命的一页”的文章，也是司空见惯的了。

且说那位老师，这时已醉得可以，变得和蔼可亲起来。他把椅子往旁一移，转身背对大家，在黑板上画起了美国地图。他要考地理了。不料他双手哆嗦，画出的地图很是糟糕，看得在场的人忍俊不禁，哧哧笑了起来。他知道是怎么回事，便使劲补救，他擦掉一些线条，再画一遍，但越画越糟，笑声随之越来越响。可他全身心投入画图，仿佛决心不为这阵阵笑声所屈服。他感到双双眼睛都注视着自己，他想象中，眼看成功在望。但笑声仍然不停，显然笑得更响。说来也不足为奇。原来，他的上方有一个阁楼，阁楼有一扇天窗就在他的头顶上，一只猫的腰、腿被绑着，从天窗上吊了下来。它的脑袋、嘴全被破布蒙着，免得它叫出声来。猫被慢慢地往下吊，弓起身子，抓着绳索。身子晃晃悠悠往下掉，爪子在空中乱抓挠。笑声越来越响，小猫离埋头画图的老师只有六英寸了，越来越近，再低一点，猫把老师的假发拼命一抓，顷刻间小猫和它的战利品被拉上了阁楼的天窗内。老师光秃秃的脑袋即刻变得光亮耀目——那是招牌油漆匠的儿子事先在他头上漆上了一层金漆。

考试就此收场。孩子们终于报仇雪恨。假期到了。

第二十二章


汤姆加入了一个新社团“少年节制会”，吸引他的是该会那一套耀眼的“徽志”。他答应在会期间，他不抽也不嚼烟，不出现亵渎神明的行为。现在他发现了一个新情况——也就是说，当一个人越答应不做某件事，他越是想去做，这是世上千真万确的道理。汤姆很快发现自己非常想喝酒，想说脏话。这愿望非常强烈，要不是有望穿上一套配上红绶带的制服，他准要退会了。七月四日15就要到了。不过他很快感到失望了——在他戴上那些枷锁还不到四十八小时，就想放弃这一希望了。于是他又把希望转到老法官富兰茨身上。富兰茨这时候显然已命悬一线，由于他是一名身居高位的官员，一场盛大的葬礼在所难免。连续三天，汤姆对这位法官的生死非常关注，急切打听这方面的消息。有时候他感到大有希望，不禁取出红绶带在穿衣镜前试戴了一番。可法官的病情时好时坏，起伏很大，令人大失所望。最后居然宣布说，法官的病情好转，不久康复了。汤姆大有上当受骗、被人羞辱之感。他当机立断申请退会。可就在当天晚上，法官旧病复发，一命呜呼。汤姆决心再也不相信这样反复无常的人了。葬礼举办得很风光。少年节制会会员的游行出尽了风头，把这位原会员妒忌得要死。

不过，汤姆又是自由之身了。这有许多好处。现在他可以喝酒，可以说脏话了。可令他想不到的是，他居然不想喝酒和说脏话了。道理很简单，正因为他可以这么做，所以才不想做，再也没什么吸引人的魅力了。

很快汤姆惊奇地发现，那日盼夜盼的假期，他竟觉得成了难以打发的苦日子了。

他原打算写日记，可三天里什么事也没发生，于是打消了这念头。

首先是黑人滑稽表演队来到镇上，轰动一时。汤姆和乔·哈珀组织了一个演出队，快活了两天。

七月四日这样光辉的日子也显得黯然失色。因为下起了大雨，结果游行不举行了。连世上最伟大的人物（汤姆是这样认为的）本顿先生，一位货真价实的参议员，也令人大失所望，因为他身高根本没有二十五英尺，甚至一点都不接近这个高度。

马戏团来了。此后孩子们用破地毯搭了个棚子，高高兴兴玩了三天马戏——要收门票，男孩每人三个别针，女孩两根——玩腻了就收场。

来了一位颅相家、一位催眠师——很快又走了，村子反而显得比过去还要沉闷，枯燥乏味。

举办过几场男女生的聚会。可是这样的聚会虽然叫人开心，但机会少之又少，所以在没有聚会的间隔时间里越发显得令人痛苦难耐了。

贝基·撒切尔上康斯坦丁堡的家去了，跟她老爸老妈一起度假，所以生活的方方面面都失去了光彩。

那场谋杀案成了可怕的秘密，像毒瘤，长期折磨人。

接着又流行起了麻疹。

汤姆像个囚犯在床上足足躺了漫长的两星期，外面发生的事一概不知。他病得很重，事事都提不起兴趣。他终于可以走动了，便到镇上转悠了一阵，只觉得身体异常虚弱，人人事事都发生了变化，叫他好不沮丧。镇子里似乎举办过一场“鼓动性的福音布道会”，不分男女老幼，人人都“入了教”。汤姆到处转悠，明知不可能，还是希望能见到一张该死的邪恶面孔，结果处处令他大失所望。他发现乔·哈珀在读《圣经》，便掉头走开，免得看到这令人心酸的场面。他找到了本·罗杰斯，见他正提着一篮子的布道小册子要去探访穷人家。他又找到基姆·霍利斯，对方提醒他说，他最近得的麻疹是千载难逢的福气，他每遇见一位玩伴，无不让他的心头更添一顿沉重。绝望之余，他去找知心朋友哈克贝利·费恩，以求得心灵的慰藉，却听到哈克给他念起了《圣经》语录。他伤心欲绝，拖着沉重的步子回家，上了床，只觉得整镇子的人都已堕落，永远回不了头。

恰逢那天晚上来了可怕的暴风雨。瓢泼大雨，雷电交加。他用被子蒙头，恐惧中等着厄运临头。他毫不怀疑，这种种可怕的景象全都是冲他而来的。他相信，他已冒犯得上苍到了忍无可忍的地步，他这就得到了报应。可他又觉得这不啻是大炮轰臭虫，徒费弹药而已，但是为了整治他这只小臭虫，又是风又是雨，大动干戈，似乎也顺理成章。

慢慢地暴风雨成了强弩之末，最后带着未完成的使命，销声匿迹了。这孩子的第一个反应就是对上天的感恩戴德，决心洗心革面。接下的反应便是觉得看情况再说——说不定再也不会来暴风雨了。

第二天大夫又被请了回来了。汤姆旧病复发。他又卧病在床三星期，这期间只觉得像是过了一辈子般的漫长。当他又可以外出，想起自己曾经何等的凄凉，何等的缺朋少友，何等的孤单，再也没有了感恩的心情了。他没精打采地在街上转悠，看见基姆·霍利斯正扮演一名少年法庭的法官，当着被害者，一只鸟的面，审理一只犯了杀人罪的猫。他还发现乔·哈珀和哈克·费恩在一条巷子里吃着偷来的瓜。这两个可怜的家伙，他也像汤姆，老毛病又犯了。





第二十三章


死气沉沉的气氛终于被打破——而且格外的活跃。杀人案开庭审理。立刻成了村子里引人的话题。汤姆没法当个旁观者。每有人提到杀人，无不在他心里引起一阵颤抖。他良心不安，他的恐惧促使他相信，人家的这些言语是针对他说的，无异起着试探的作用。他猜不透，人家怎么会怀疑上他知道那次杀人案。但一听到人们的闲言碎语，他就觉得不自在，始终引得他打起了寒战。他领着哈克来到一个僻静的地方，与他谈谈，让这根贴了封条的舌头解放片刻，与另一位“难友”分担一下自己痛苦的重负，不失为种放松自己的好办法。此外，他也想摸清，哈克是不是仍然守口如瓶。

“哈克，那事儿你有没有告诉过别人？”

“啥事儿？”

“啥事你自己明白。”

“哦，当然没。”

“一个字也没说？”

“行行好吧，我可没说过。你干吗问这个？”

“我只是担心。”

“我说，汤姆·索亚，要是这事儿败露，咱俩两天都活不成。你这是清楚的。”

这下汤姆放心多了。停了片刻后，他说：

“哈克，没人能让你说出去的，是不是？”

“让我说出去？要是我希望那狗杂种淹死我，我倒会说出去。可没门。”

“那就好。我想，只要咱们死活不说，就万无一失。不过咱俩还得再起一次誓，这样更保险。”

“行。”

于是两人又起了一通毒誓。

“哈克，他们到处都在议论些啥？我可听到了不少。”

“议论？尽在议论穆夫·波特，穆夫·波特，穆夫·波特。让我听了出了一身冷汗，所以我想找个地方躲躲。”

“我听到的也全是这些。我估摸着他死定了。有时候你是不是为他感到不好受？”

“差不离老是这样——差不离老这样。他是算不了什么，可他没干过伤天害理的事，不过是钓点鱼，换几个钱把自己灌个烂醉——不少时间就东游西逛。可老天爷，咱们不都是一个样吗——至少大多数人是这样——就连牧师也一个样。可他这人倒不赖。有一次，他钓来的鱼不够两个人吃，他还是分给了我一半哩。好几次，我倒运的时候，他还出手帮过我一把。”

“可不是，他帮我修过风筝，哈克，帮过我往线上装鱼钩。要是咱们能救他出来就好了。”

“天哪！这事咱们办不到，汤姆。再说，这也没有用。到头来他们还是把他抓回去的。”

“不错——是会抓回去的。可我就不爱听他们把他骂得像个魔鬼，可他什么也没干。”

“我也一样，汤姆。老天爷，我常听他们说他是乡里最残忍的坏蛋，他们就是想不通过去怎么没吊死他。”

“不错。他们老这么说。我也听说过，要是他被释放出来，他们就动用私刑整死他。”

“他们是不会放过他的。”

两个孩子交谈了很久，但心里还是非常不安。天色越来越暗，不知不觉间他俩已逛到了那座孤零零的小班房的边上，也许心里藏着一个朦胧的希望，但愿当晚会发生一件事，一举解决了他们的难题。但是什么事也没发生。似乎并没有什么天使或仙女对这个倒运的囚犯产生兴趣。

他俩像过去常做的一样，来到铁窗前，递给波特一些烟草和火柴。他被关在底层，牢房没有看守。

他对他们送来的礼物表现出的感激之情总是使他们的良心受到谴责——这一次更甚。一听波特说出了以下的一番话，更使他们觉得自己怯懦和卑下：

“孩子，你们对我好到家了——是镇上对我最好的人了。我忘不了你俩。忘不了。我老跟自个儿说：‘过去我常帮孩子修风筝，修别的东西，告诉他们哪里能钓到鱼，尽量跟他们交朋友。可老穆夫遭了殃，他们就忘了他了。汤姆没忘，哈克也没忘——他俩没忘了他。’我说：‘我也没忘了他俩！’我说，孩子，我干了件可怕的事——当时喝醉了酒，疯了，我只能这么说，为这事我就要被吊死。没说的。没说的，我估摸着，这是最好的下场。也是我希望得到的下场。得了，咱们还是不谈这个。我不想害得你们难受。你们跟我做了朋友。我想说的是，你们往后可不能贪杯，那样就不会落到这种地方了。再往西站过去一点。好，就这样。一个遭大难的人能见到一张亲切的脸，心里别提有多舒坦。除了你俩，有谁来这里看我？两张多亲切的脸蛋儿——多亲切。你俩先后各站在对方的肩膀上，好让我摸摸你俩的脸蛋儿。就这么着。握握手——把手伸进铁栅内，只是我的手太大了。小手好，只是弱了点，给了穆夫·波特力量。要是办得到，这两双手还能帮他更多的忙哩。”

汤姆忧心忡忡地回了家。晚上尽做噩梦。第二天，第三天，他在法庭外转悠，几乎有一种难以抑制的冲动，催着他进法庭，但脚就是挪不开。哈克也有相同的体验。他俩有意避着对方，各自时不时从法庭走开，但鬼使神差很快就转了回来。每当看热闹的人从法庭出来，汤姆就竖起耳朵听起来，但听到的尽是些叫人扫兴的消息。无情地套在波特身上的法网越来越紧。第二天晚上，村民们议论纷纷，说印第安人乔的证据确凿，不可推翻。陪审团会作出什么样的裁决是铁定了的。

汤姆很晚才回家，翻窗进了房。他激动至极，过了好几小时他才睡去。第二天，村民们全部出动，纷纷拥向法庭，因为这是重大的日子。挤得水泄不通的旁听者中几乎是男女各半。经过长时间的等待后，陪审团的成员鱼贯而入，各就各位。很快，波特戴着脚镣，被带了进来，他脸色苍白、憔悴，一副怯生生而绝望的样子。众人好奇的目光全都集中到了他坐着的地方。印第安人乔也坐在同样显眼的地方。他一如既往，不动声色。又是一阵等待之后，法官到来，这位执法官宣布开庭。紧接着响起律师的絮语声，混杂着翻动文件的沙沙声。这些小细节和被耽搁了的时间无不给人造成一种开庭前准备工作期间的那种庄严神秘的气氛。

一位证人被传上来，他证实就在杀人案发生的那天清晨，他看见穆夫·波特在小溪沟里洗过澡，后来便悄悄溜走了。经过一番审问，控方律师说：

“询问证人。”

犯人抬起头看了片刻，但他的律师一开口，他又垂下了眼睛：

“我没有问题要问。”

第二个证人作证说，那把刀是在尸体旁边找到的。控方律师说：

“询问证人。”

“我没有什么要问他。”波特的律师说。

第三位证人发誓，他经常看到波特带着那把刀。

“询问证人。”

波特的律师没有什么要问的。

旁听的人个个面露怒色。莫非这位律师不愿花点力气就让自己的当事人丢掉一命吗？

又有几个证人供述了波特被带到杀人现场时所表现出来的心虚举动。这些证人没有经过反诘就离席了。

那天早晨发生在墓地里种种对波特不利的细节，在场的人都记得清清楚楚，证人的供述也明白无误，但波特的律师却没诘问任何一个，怪不得法庭上立即响起了不满声，大家交头接耳，十分愤慨，但遭到法官的呵斥。这时控方律师说：

“根据几位本镇市民证词看来，他们所说的简单的话是毋庸置疑的，据此断定，这起骇人听闻的罪行是这个不幸的在押犯人所为。我们宣布终止对本案的辩护。”

可怜的波特听罢哼了一声。双手捂住脸，身子微微前后摇晃着。法庭笼罩在一片痛苦的沉默中，许多男人为之动容，许多妇女为他流下了同情的眼泪。被告律师站了起来，说：

“法官大人，本案审理伊始，我们一度认为，我们此次的目的在于证明，我们的当事人受了酒精的毒害产生了神经错乱，他就是在这种迷乱和无法控制的情况下，做出了这一可怕的事。现在看来这一说法，言之过早，我们不得不改变自己的观点。我们将不再提出辩诉，”转对书记员：“请传汤姆·索亚。”

大厅里人人都露出迷惑不解的惊讶神色，连波特也不例外。汤姆站了起来，来到证人席，双双眼睛都惊讶地紧盯着他看。这孩子显得六神无主，他吓坏了。他宣了誓。

“汤姆·索亚，六月十七日，半夜里，你在哪里？”

汤姆瞥了一眼印第安人乔那板着的铁青脸，舌头僵直了。在场的人喘着大气，等着他说些什么。可他硬是说不出话来。过了好一会儿，这孩子终于缓过了劲，好不容易发出了点声，大厅里部分人这才听清了：

“在墓地！”

“请再大声点。别害怕。你是在——”

“墓地里。”

印第安人乔脸上露出不以为然的神色。

“你是在霍斯·威廉斯坟墓附近的某个地方吗？”

“是的，先生。”

“请再大声点。离得有多远？”

“就像我现在离你这么近。”

“你是不是躲着的？”

“我是躲着的。”

“躲在哪里？”

“坟墓边上那棵榆树后面。”

印第安人乔露出一丝难以觉察的惊讶。

“有人跟你在一起吗？”

“有，先生。跟我一起去的——”

“且慢——且慢。别提跟你一起的那个人姓名。我们会在适当的时间请他到场的。你随身带什么东西没有？”

汤姆迟疑了一会儿，显得不知所措。

“说出来，孩子——别害怕。真话永远受到尊重。你带去了什么？”

“只是——只是一只死猫。”

庭上响起了一阵嬉笑声，但被法官喝止了。

“我们会出示猫的尸骨。孩子，把发生的事全说出来——放心说出来，什么也别遗漏，别害怕。”

汤姆说了起来——开始时有点结结巴巴，后来越来越流畅了。有一会儿，除了他的说话声，谁也不吭一声，一双双眼睛全盯着他。大家无不张大嘴巴，屏住呼吸，聚精会神听着他的话，完全被这离奇恐怖的叙述所吸引，忘记了时间的流逝。当他说到以下一段话时，人们压在心头的愤怒达到了顶点：

“——医生举起了木板，穆夫应声倒地，印第安人乔拿着刀跳了过来——”

哗啦！那杂种快如闪电扑向窗户，冲开所有拦阻他的人，逃之夭夭。





第二十四章


汤姆再次成了光彩夺目的大英雄——老年人的宠儿，年轻人羡慕的人物。他的名字甚至上了镇里的报纸，大加赞美，名留千古。有人说，日后要是他能逃脱被吊死的厄运，准能坐上总统的宝座。

这个变化无常而毫无理智的世界，一如既往，过去起劲地侮辱了穆夫·波特，现在又对他投怀送抱，百般关爱，竭力抚慰。不过这也是这个世界的人之常情，倒也不必大惊小怪。

白天里汤姆的日子过得逍遥自在，辉煌荣耀，可到了晚上，则充满了恐惧。印第安人乔夜夜都搅扰他的清梦，眼中总是透着杀气。天黑之后，任你的诱惑有多大，他都吓得足不出户。可怜的哈克也不例外，时时处于恐怖和苦恼之中，因为在审判前一天，汤姆事先已把事情的原委向律师和盘托出。尽管印第安人乔的逃脱，使他免遭出庭作证之苦，哈克还是惴惴不安，唯恐泄露了消息，牵连到了他。可怜的家伙虽然得到律师的应诺，会严守秘密，但这也无济于事。汤姆曾立下毒誓，说什么都守口如瓶，可经不起良心的折磨，晚上，跑到律师家，把这个可怕的秘密告诉了律师。如此一来，你叫哈克如何再相信世人呢？

白天，穆夫·波特对汤姆说出了实情千恩万谢，汤姆听了很受用。可一到晚上，他便后悔起来，不该泄露了秘密。

一来汤姆害怕印第安人乔逃脱法网，同时又担心印第安人乔被抓住。他相信，除非这家伙死了，亲眼看到了他的死尸，否则他是永无宁日的。

捉拿罪犯的悬赏公布了。各处搜寻个遍，可就不见印第安人的踪影。从圣路易斯来了一位无所不知、无所不能、令人生畏的大侦探。他四处搜索了一番，摇头晃脑，像个大智大慧的能人，作出了他那个行当的人都能作出的惊人成绩。也就是说，他“找到了一条线索”，可你不能凭线索将杀人犯送上绞架。所以这大侦探办完案、打道回府后，汤姆还是觉得和过去一样的不安全。

日子慢吞吞地过去，恐惧心也一天天略略减轻。





第二十五章


每个智力健全的男孩子，一生中都会出现这么一个阶段，他往往生出强烈的愿望，要去某个地方寻找地下宝藏。一天，汤姆也突生这样的愿望。他心血来潮，出去找乔·哈珀，可没有找到。接着找本·罗杰斯，他不在家，钓鱼去了。很快他碰巧遇到了血手大盗哈克·费恩。哈克·费恩一向与他志同道合。汤姆领着他到了一个隐蔽的地方，信心十足地向他透露了自己的心事。哈克听了一拍即合。凡是好玩的事，又用不着花钱，哈克无不趋之若鹜，因为他有的是多余的时间，它们不但当不了钱用，反而惹来了不少麻烦。“上哪儿挖去？”哈克问。

“哦，哪里都可以。”

“这么说，到处都有？”

“哪能呢，不是这样。宝贝都藏在非常非常特别的地方。哈克——有时藏在岛上，有时在一株枯死的老树树枝下埋着的烂箱子里，就在半夜树枝投下的阴影下。不过最有可能是在闹鬼房子的地板下。”

“哪个埋下的？”

“当然是强盗——不是他们，你说还有哪个？主日学校的校长会藏吗？”

“我说不上。换了我，是不会藏的。我会花了它，开开心心过日子。”

“我也一个样。可强盗不会这么干。他们就爱把宝贝藏起来，然后就不管了。”

“以后他们就不再回来取了吗？”

“那倒不是。他们原打算要回来取的，可后来渐渐忘了自己做的记号，要不他们死了。反正，宝贝埋了很久很久，都生起锈来了。后来有人找到了一张发黄的旧纸片儿，标明哪儿有宝贝——这样的纸片儿得花上一个星期才能搞清楚其中的含义，因为上面记的尽是符号和象形文字。”

“象形——啥？”

“象形文字——画儿和一些东西，看起来啥也不明白是啥意思。”

“你有这样的纸片吗，汤姆？”

“没有。”

“得，那你怎能找到标记？”

“我可不需要什么标记。他们一向就把宝贝埋在闹鬼的房子下、岛上，要不就藏在枯死的老树枝下。那好，我们已在杰克逊岛试过一回，可以再去找。那儿有座闹鬼的房子，就在酒坊溪上游，那儿有许许多多枯树——多极了。”

“株株树下都有？”

“瞧你说的！不是！”

“那你怎么知道哪株树下有？”

“把所有的树都找了个遍不就行了吗？”

“我说，汤姆，那还不花上整整一个夏天吗？”

“可不是，这算得了什么？你想想，找到了一只铜壶，里面有一百块钱币，全生了锈的。颜色发灰，要不就是装满宝石的烂箱子，那会怎么样？”

哈克的眼睛顿时发了光。

“太开心了，开心死我了。我只要那一百块钱，宝石全归你。”

“好哩。不过跟你实说吧，宝石我是不会扔掉的，可值钱哩，每粒抵二十元。没有一粒低于六毛，或一元的。”

“是吗！你说的当真？”

“当然当真，大伙都这么说。你没见过宝石，哈克？”

“我记得没见过。”

“哦，国王就有一大堆宝石。”

“得了，我可没见过什么国王。”

“我想你没见过。要是你去一趟欧洲，就会看到一大帮国王蹦来跳去的。”

“他们在蹦蹦跳跳？”

“不，娘的！不是！”

“那你干吗说他们蹦来跳去？”

“废话！我是说你会见到他们——当然不蹦来跳去——他们干吗要蹦来跳去？我只说你会见到他们——到处都有——一般来说是这样。譬如说那个驼背的老理查吧。”

“理查？他还有别的名字吗？”

“他没别的名字。当国王的有名无姓。”

“没有姓吗？”

“没有。”

“得，管它呢，随他们的便，汤姆。可我不想当国王，像个黑人，有名无姓我才不干哩。那好，你说，咱们先在哪儿挖？”

“可不，我也不知道。譬如说拿酒坊岔道对面山冈上那株老枯树动手试试，怎么样？”

“行。”

两个孩子搞来了一把坏十字镐、一把铁锹，便动身了，走了三英里，累得大汗淋漓，气喘吁吁，躺倒在附近一棵榆树下歇息，抽了一会儿烟。

“这地方我喜欢。”汤姆说。

“我也喜欢。”

“我说，哈克，要是在这儿找到宝藏，你打算拿你那一份怎么办？”

“我要天天吃馅饼，喝一瓶汽水。只要有马戏表演，我便看个遍。我敢说，那就过上快快活活的日子了。”

“那你就不省下一点吗？”

“省？干吗要省？”

“不是吗，省点下来往后好过日子呀。”

“哦，这没用。总有一天我爹要回到镇子上来，要是我不把钱花光，他就抢了去。告诉你吧，他很快就花得一文不剩的。那么你拿自己的一份去干什么，汤姆？”

“我要去买只新鼓，买把真正的剑，再买一条红领带，一只小狗，然后结婚。”

“结婚！”

“不错。”

“汤姆，你——你这不是疯了吗？”

“等着瞧吧。”

“你干的是最最蠢的事，汤姆。瞧我爹和我娘吧，尽闹架！哎呀，他俩整天打打闹闹的！我记得可清啦。”

“不相干。我娶的女孩子不会闹架。”

“汤姆，就我所知，女孩子全一个样。她们都会折磨人。这事儿你得多寻思寻思。告诉你，最好多寻思寻思。那丫头叫什么来着，汤姆？”

“不是丫头——是姑娘。”

“反正是一回事。有人爱说丫头，有人爱说姑娘——差不离，一个样。那么她叫什么来着，汤姆？”

“以后告诉你——现在不行。”

“得了，就这么办。只是你一结了婚，我就更孤独了。”

“不会的，到时候你过来跟我们一起过日子。不说这个了，还是动手挖宝吧。”

两个人干了半个小时，流了一身汗，可毫无结果。又费了半小时的劲，还是白费劲。哈克说：

“人家是不是老埋得这么深？”

“有时候——不是老这样。不是老埋得很深。我看咱俩是不是没有挖对地方？”

于是他们又选了个地方，再次挖了起来。这次手脚慢了些，可还是有进展的。他们一声不吭又埋头苦干了一会儿。最后哈克身子靠在铁锹上，用袖子擦着额上的汗珠子，说：

“干完了这一次，你还打算往哪里去挖？”

“我看也许该到寡妇屋后的卡迪夫山崖上那株老树下试试。”

“我看那是个好地方。可是那寡妇会不会抢了宝贝去，汤姆？那可是她的地盘。”

“她抢了去！她倒是想试哩。哪个找到藏宝，东西就归哪个。这跟地是哪个的没有关系。”

这就放心了。于是两个人又干了起来。后来哈克又说了：

“该死！咱俩又找错了地方。你说呢？”

“太怪了，哈克。可把我搞糊涂了。有时候巫婆硬是来捣乱。我猜想，麻烦就麻烦在这里。”

“瞎说！大白天巫婆使不上劲。”

“哦，你说对了。我就没有想到这一茬。现在我明白了到底是怎么一回事。该死！咱俩真是大傻瓜！该在半夜树影落下的地方挖才是！”

“见鬼，傻干了大半天，全是白费劲。到头来晚上还得再回来。路可远哩。你能跑出来？”

“保证能。今晚非得干不可。因为要是有人看见这些窟窿，立马就知道里面藏着什么，肯定会来挖。”

“好吧，今晚我来找你，学猫喵喵叫几声。”

“说好了。工具就藏在树丛中得了。”

夜里，两个孩子大约在约定的时间到了那里。他俩坐在树影下等着。这地方很偏僻，加上古老的传说，使得这里显得更加的阴森凄凉。沙沙的树叶声中，鬼怪在窃窃私语，阴暗的角落里有阴魂出没，远处传来狗的低沉吠声，猫头鹰报丧般的叫声与之应和。两个孩子被这阴森的气氛镇住了，话也不敢说。后来他俩推测，该是夜半十二时了，便在树影落下的地方做上记号，挖了起来。他们的希望开始上升。兴趣越来越浓，劲头也越来越足。窟窿越挖越深。每听到铁镐碰到什么东西，心脏跟着跳快起来，但结果只是一次又一次的失望。碰到的只是石头或土块。最后汤姆说：

“白费劲，哈克，咱们又挖错了地方。”

“不，不可能搞错。树影对得很准，丝毫错不了。”

“这我知道，不过还有别的原因。”

“什么原因？”

“时间上咱们只是猜的。很可能不是太迟了，就是太早了。”

哈克随手把铁锹一扔。

“说对了，”他道，“麻烦就出在这儿。咱们又得放弃这儿。咱俩不可能知道准确的时间，再说干这种事也太邪乎了，半夜三更，到处都有巫婆、鬼怪晃来晃去，我老觉得背后待着什么东西，吓得我不敢回头看，兴许还有别的鬼怪在等待时机哩。自打我来到这儿，老起鸡皮疙瘩。”

“可不，我也好不了多少，哈克。人家在树下埋财宝的时候，总要放进一个死人，让他看守着。”

“老天爷！”

“真的，他们是这么干的。我老听人家这么说。”

“汤姆，我可不爱在有死人的地方转悠。跟死人待在一起会惹麻烦的，错不了。”

“我也不愿惊动他们，哈克。要是这里的死人伸出骷髅头，说起话来，那多可怕！”

“汤姆，别说了。吓死我了。”

“可不是，正是这样，哈克。我心里也打着鼓哩。”

“汤姆，咱们还是离开这儿吧，上别的地方试试。”

“好吧，我想那样更好。”

“上哪儿呢？”

汤姆想了想，回答说：

“找个闹鬼的房子。错不了。”

“该死！我不喜欢闹鬼的房子，汤姆。哎呀，那些地方比死人还要可怕。死人兴许会说话，可他们不会像鬼怪那样，披着裹尸布到处乱闯，趁人不注意的时候，冷不防在身后紧紧看着你，牙齿咬得咯咯响。这我可受不了，汤姆——谁也受不了。”

“话是不错，可，哈克，鬼魂只是在夜里出来——大白天他们是不会打搅咱们挖宝的。”

“说得也是。可你很清楚，不论是白天，还是黑夜，谁也不去闹鬼房子的。”

“我说，那很可能是因为人家不愿去杀过人的地方。就是在夜里，也没见发生过什么事——只是窗边会出现些幽幽的蓝色火光——没有常说的鬼怪。”

“得了，当你见到幽幽的蓝光，后面肯定紧跟着鬼。这说法准有道理。因为你知道，除了鬼怪，谁会用那玩意儿。”

“说对了，不过大白天他们是不会出来的，所以有什么好怕的？”

“好吧，既然你这么说，那就找闹鬼的房子吧。不过那还得碰运气。”

这时候他俩开始下山。山谷里月色姣好，山谷中间便是座“闹鬼”的房子。房子孤零零的，周围的栅栏早已不知去向，门前台阶上长满荒草，烟囱倒塌，窗框空荡荡的，房顶的一角也已塌陷。两个孩子凝神打量了一会儿，有点担心窗后会有蓝光闪过。彼此交谈了几句，声音压得很低，在那样的时刻、那种环境下是不会高声说话的。随后向右，远远绕过闹鬼的房子，与它保持一个安全的距离，再穿过卡迪夫山后的林子，回家了。





第二十六章


第二天中午，两个孩子来到了那株枯树下，他们是来拿工具的。汤姆急着要去那座闹鬼的房子，哈克也有点相同的想法，可是他突然说：

“听着，汤姆，你知道今儿是星期几？”

汤姆暗自算了算：今天倒是星期几呢，然后抬起眼睛，惊讶地说：

“啊哟，我压根就没想过今儿是星期几，哈克！”

“可不是，我也没有想过，我猛地想到今儿是星期五16。”

“该死，看来凡事是得多小心，哈克。星期五干这种事，很可能会惹大麻烦的。”

“很可能！不如说：准会惹大麻烦的！好日子有的是，星期五可不行。”

“傻瓜也知道这道理，也不是你第一个发现，哈克。”

“得了，我没说我第一个发现，是不是？还不单单是星期五这个日子呢。昨晚我还做了个可怕的噩梦——梦见耗子了。”

“该死！这可是坏兆头！耗子打架了？”

“没有。”

“那就好，哈克。知道吗，耗子没打架，那只是表示会有麻烦。我们只要处处留神，别惹上就好了。今儿不干了，改日再说吧。你知道罗宾汉的故事吗，哈克？”

“不知道。罗宾汉是哪个？”

“他嘛，他是早年英国的一名好汉，最了不起的人物。他是名强盗。”

“老天爷，我多想做个强盗。他都打劫了谁？”

“只打劫郡长、主教、富人、国王这些人。他从不打劫穷人。他喜欢穷人。他老把抢来的东西与他们平分。”

“好嘛，他肯定是个好汉。”

“告诉你吧，他肯定是，哈克。哦，从来没见过他这样高尚的人。实说吧，现在这样的人哪里去找？就是绑上他的一只手，英格兰也没人斗得过他。他使起紫杉长弓来，就是一英里半开外的一枚银角子，他也百发百中。”

“紫杉长弓是啥玩意儿？”

“不知道。反正是种弓呗。要是只射中银角子的边，他准坐下来哭个半天——骂自己是孬种哩。咱们这就来演罗宾汉吧，可好玩哩。我教你。”

“行！”

两个孩子演了足足一个下午的罗宾汉，时不时热切地瞅一眼下面那闹鬼的房子一眼，交谈几句有关第二天会有什么收获、有什么运气之类的话。太阳渐渐下山了，他们穿过长长的树影，踏上回家的路，他俩的身影很快消失在卡迪夫山的林子中。

星期六，刚过了中午，两个孩子又来到那棵枯树下，在树荫下抽了会儿烟，聊了一会儿天，在挖过的坑里又挖了一会儿。他们这么做倒不存多大的希望，只是因为汤姆说，多次出现过这样的情况：有人在挖到离财宝只有不到六英寸的地方便停了下来不挖了，后来别的人来了，只动了几锹就把财宝挖走了。可是这次他们还是以失败告终。两个人扛着工具走了。他们觉得自己并不只是来碰好运，寻宝该做的事他们反正全都做了，已尽心尽力了。

两个人一到那闹鬼的房子，只感到在热辣辣的阳光下，这里却是一片死寂，弥漫着一种阴森恐怖的怪异气氛，使这个原本偏僻而孤独的地方显得分外的压抑，令人望而生畏，不敢进去。两个孩子蹑手蹑脚来到门口，战战兢兢地朝里张望。但见一个房间里杂草丛生，没了地板，墙上石灰脱落，有一个古旧的壁炉，窗户空荡荡的，楼梯破败不堪，残缺破烂的蜘蛛网遍布。两个人悄悄地走了进去，提心吊胆，压低声音说话，耳朵警觉地捕捉着哪怕是最细微的声响，浑身肌肉绷紧，准备随时逃走。

过了一会儿，他们对情况慢慢地熟悉了，也不再那么害怕了，便兴趣盎然地仔细查看起来，为自己的大胆沾沾自喜，同时也感到惊奇。接着他们想到楼上去看看。一到楼上可就断了逃跑的后路了。但两人互相激励一番，唯一的结果便是——把工具扔到角落里，上楼去。楼上同样是一派破败荒凉的景象。一个角落里有只壁柜，里面可望存有秘密，可他们的希望落空，里面空空如也。好在他们已勇气大增，信心百倍。就在他们准备下楼，大干一番的时候，只听得汤姆嘘了一声。

“怎么回事？”吓得哈克脸色发白，低声问道。

“嘘！听！听见没有？”

“听见了！老天爷，快跑！”

“别声张！别乱动！他们正向门口过来。”

两个孩子直直地趴在地板上，眼睛对着木板的木节孔，看着，等着，胆战心惊。

“停下来不走了——不，过来了——就在那边。别吱声，哈克。老天，要是不进来就好了。”

进来两个人。这两个孩子心里都在想：“一个便是那个又聋又哑的西班牙老头，最近在镇子里露过一两次面，另一个以前没见过。”

那另一个破衣烂衫，垢头蓬面，那脸面让人看了就难受。那西班牙老头身上裹着一块彩色毛毯，满脸浓密的白胡须，墨西哥宽檐帽下垂着长长的白头发，还戴着一副绿眼镜。进门的时候，那另一个人正低声说着话。他们在地上坐了下来，脸朝门，背向墙壁，刚才说话的人还在说着。看来他没那么紧张了，说的话也更清晰些。

“不行，”他说，“我仔细想过了，我不想干，太危险了。”

“危险！”那又聋又哑的西班牙老头嘟哝道，两个孩子听了大吃一惊，“胆小鬼！”

这一声“胆小鬼”吓得两个孩子倒抽了口冷气，身子一阵哆嗦。原来他是印第安人乔！好一会儿一片沉默后，乔开了口：

“还有什么比上游干的那一票更危险的？结果还不是好好的吗？”

“不一样。在上游那么远的地方，周围没人家，虽然我们干了那么长的时间，没有成功，到底没被人发现。”

“得了，大白天上这儿来那才叫危险呢。只要被人看见，他们就会起疑心。”

“我知道。不过比起上次干过那件傻事的地方，这儿算是挺近便的了。我要离开这破房子了。昨天就想走了，只是碍着有两个破孩子一直在山上玩，怕被他们看见，才不敢动弹。”

那两个“破孩子”一听这话，明白了怎么回事，又是一阵哆嗦。心想，幸亏昨天想起是星期五，决定再等一天。要是这样，即使等上一年，他们也心甘情愿。那两个家伙取出食物，吃了起来。很久没人说话，那两个人都在想着什么，后来印第安人乔说：

“听我说，兄弟。你回属于你的上游去，等着我的信。我要找机会溜到镇上去摸摸情况。等到我摸清了情况，认为条件好，咱们就来干那‘危险’的活儿。干完了去得克萨斯！咱俩一块儿走着去。”

这样的安排双方都满意。于是两人都打起了呵欠，印第安人乔说：

“我瞌睡死了。这一回得由你来望风。”

他把身子缩成了一团，躺在草丛中，很快就打起了呼噜。他的同伙推了他一两次，呼噜不打了。很快那望风者也打起了盹，头越垂越低，两个人一齐打起呼噜来了。

两个孩子好不高兴，深深地吸了口气。汤姆悄声说：

“机会来了——走！”

哈克说：

“我不行——他们一醒来，我死定了。”

汤姆催着他，哈克就是不敢。最后汤姆慢慢地悄悄站起来，打算一个人走掉。可刚跨出第一步，踩得摇摇晃晃的楼板发出刺耳的吱嘎声。他吓破了胆，连忙趴了下去，再也不敢迈第二步了。两个孩子趴在那儿苦等苦熬着时间一分一秒过去，只觉得时间停息了，永恒都已成了白头。最后，值得庆幸的是，他俩发现，太阳终于开始下山了。

这时候有个人停止了打呼噜。印第安人乔爬了起来，打量一番四周，再朝同伙冷冷一笑。只见他脑袋低低地垂在膝盖上，又踢了他一脚，踢醒了他，说；

“听着！你不是在望风吗，是不是？还好，没出什么事。”

“哟！我没睡着吧？”

“哦，差不多，算是差不多吧。咱们该动身了，伙计。剩下的那小包货该怎么处理呢？”

“说不好——还是和过去一样，就留在这儿吧。去南方前带着也没用。带着六百五十枚银币到底不便。”

“得——就这么办，再回来取也不碍事。”

“行——我得说，还是像过去一样，晚上来——更好。”

“好。听我说，得等一段时间才找得到动手的机会。意外的事随时都会发生。这儿可不是好地方，干脆把它埋起来——埋得深深的。”

“好主意。”那个同伙说，他走过房间，跪了下去，端起炉子后面一块石头，拎出一个布袋，顿时响起叮叮当当声，听来十分诱人。他从袋子里掏出二三十块钱留给自己，又递给印第安人乔数目相同的钱，同时把袋子也给了他。这时印第安人乔正单膝跪在一个角落里，用博伊刀17挖着。

两个孩子看得入了迷，早已把自己的恐惧和不幸丢到脑后去了。他俩目光炯炯，注视着那两个人的一举一动。多幸运——做梦也不会想到有这样的好运。六百块钱——足可让五六个孩子发大财！这可真是吉星高照，不费吹灰之力，满有把握就找到藏宝的地方。他俩不禁时不时捅起了胳膊肘来——干吗捅胳膊肘呢？明摆着，还用说吗？“哦，这下你还不高兴咱俩上这儿来吗？”

乔的刀碰到什么东西。

“喂！”他说。

“怎么回事？”他的同伙问。

“一块半烂的木板——不，我想是只箱子。过来，帮我一把，看看到底是怎么回事。没问题，我已戳了个洞。”

他伸手进去，又抽了出来。

“伙计，是钱！”

两个人仔细地看起了一大把硬币。全是金币。楼上的两个孩子也跟他们一样非常兴奋，高兴得不行。

乔的伙伴说：

“咱们得麻利点，角落里的草丛中有把生了锈的旧铁镐，就在壁炉那一头——一分钟前我刚见过。”

他跑过去把孩子的镐和锹拿了过来，仔细地打量了一番，摇了摇头，径自嘟哝几句，拿起家伙干了起来。箱子很快出了土。箱子不大，外面包着铁皮，原本很结实，年深日久，已锈蚀不堪了。两人一言不发，喜滋滋地打量着这财宝。

“伙计，有好几千呢。”印第安人乔说。

“早有人说啦，穆雷尔那一帮人整整一个夏天都在这里转悠。”那陌生人说。

“我知道，”印第安人乔说，“我敢说，像那么回事。”

“现在用不着再干那事了。”

这混血儿皱起了眉头。他说：

“你不了解我。至少你不了解那件事。我不是为了谋财——是报仇！”他说着，眼露凶光，“我需要你助我一臂之力。成功后，就去得克萨斯。你回你的南茜和孩子身边，等我的信。”

“好，就按你说的办。可该拿这个怎么办——再埋回去？”

“对。（楼上的人听了别提有多高兴了）不，看在老天的分儿上，不行！（这下楼上人的心冷透了）我差点忘了说了，这镐上有新鲜的泥土！（两个孩子一时间吓得不行）这里放着镐和锹干吗？哪个拿来的——他们上哪里去了？你听到什么动静没有？看到什么人没有？怎么！把东西埋回去，好让人家看出土被动过了？不成——不成。还是拿到我的住处去。”

“可不是，当然得拿走。早想到这一点就好了。你是指一号？”

“不，是二号——十字架下的那个。另一个不好——太一般了。”

“行。天快黑了，要不就来不及了。”

印第安人乔站起身，一个个窗口走过去，全都朝外面仔细观察了一阵，然后说：

“哪个把这些工具带到这儿来的？你看，他们是不是有可能待在楼上？”

两个孩子吓掉了魂。印第安人乔手拿着刀，迟疑了片刻，犹豫了一阵，然后转过身向楼梯走去。两个孩子想躲进壁柜，可浑身没半点力气。双脚踏在梯级上发出嘎吱嘎吱声——情况非常危急，在这千钧一发之际，孩子们突然有了决心——他们就要向壁柜奔过去，就在这时候，响起了那腐朽的梯级啪啪断裂声，紧跟着印第安人乔翻身掉了下去，倒在垮下去的朽木堆中。他嘴里骂骂咧咧，挣扎着站起来，他的同伙见了说道：

“何苦呢？就算有人，他们也是楼上，让他们在那儿待着——碍谁了？要是他们想跳下来找麻烦，谁拦着？十五分钟内，天就黑了——他们想跟着咱们，让他们跟着得了。我喜欢着哩。依我看来，哪个把这些玩意儿丢在这儿，见了咱们，准把咱们当成鬼怪什么的，我敢说，他们准要溜之大吉的。”

乔嘟哝了几声，同意同伙的说法。离天黑不远了，应当抓紧时间，做好准备，好动身了。不久，他们在越来越浓的夜色下，带着那只装财宝的箱子，偷偷地溜出门向河边走去。

汤姆和哈克站起了身，浑身无力，却如释重负。他们透过木板缝，瞪着眼睛，凝视着那两个人离去的背影。跟踪他们？办不到——能跳下楼不摔断脖子，翻过山，回到镇上去，就万幸了。他俩很少说话，只恨自己碰上了倒运，悔不该把工具扔在那儿，要不印第安人乔就不会起疑心，就会把金币藏在这里，等到“复了仇”再回来拿。到时候发现钱币没了踪影就有他好受的了。多倒运，多倒运，偏把工具扔在那儿！

两个人下定决心，要是那个西班牙人到镇里找机会复仇，他俩就紧紧盯着他，不管这“二号”在哪里，都要跟踪他到“二号”。接着汤姆出现了一个想法，吓坏了他。

“复仇？要是指的是跟咱们复仇呢，哈克？”

“哦。别说了。”听得哈克差点没昏过去。

一路上他俩把这事细细地分析了一番，到了镇上，两个人都一致相信，那人很可能指的是跟别的什么人复仇，顶多只有汤姆有这可能，因为只有汤姆出庭作过证。

你看，只有汤姆孤孤单单一人会身陷险境，他心里舒坦得了吗？他心想，要是能有个伴就强多了。





第二十七章


白天的历险搅得汤姆晚上噩梦连连。先后四次他都把那些大量的财宝搞到手，可四次醒过来，无不两手空空，害得他睡不了好觉，不得不回到不幸的残酷现实中。大清早醒来，他回忆起了这趟大历险中发生的种种事件，却奇怪地发现，那些事竟是如此模糊久远，仿佛发生在另一个世界，多年前发生的事。后来他觉得，这次大历险本身就是一场梦。他的这一想法自有其充分的理由，也就是说，他看见的钱币数量之多简直令人难以置信。过去他从未见过数目超过五十元的一堆钱。他也像所有他那样岁数、同样境况的孩子，认为“几百”“几千”元不过是想象中的钱数，现实世界中并不存在。他从来没有想过，哪怕是片刻也没想过，一个人真的会拥有一百元这样的巨款。若是分析一下他头脑中的藏宝概念，那些宝藏只不过是一把碎角子，外加一堆模糊不清、抓不住、摸不到的金光灿灿的钱币而已。

可是经他反复思考之后，历险中详情细节显得越来越清晰明朗，所以他很快便得到一个印象：反正那不是梦。不能再有怀疑了。他得赶紧吃完早饭，去找哈克。

哈克正坐在一条平底船的舷边，两只脚无精打采地在水中晃来荡去，一副愁眉苦脸的样子。汤姆决定让哈克自己先提这话题，要是他不提，那这趟历险肯定是场梦了。

“你好，哈克！”

“你也好。”

片刻的沉默。

“汤姆，要是咱们把该死的工具留在那株枯树下，就捞到那些钱了。哦，糟透了！”

“就是说，那不是梦，不是梦！可我倒希望那是梦哩。骗你是小狗，哈克。”

“什么梦？”

“昨天那事儿。我总觉得像是梦。”

“梦！要是梯级没断裂，你就知道那是什么样的梦了！我做了一夜的梦，老梦到那个戴眼罩的西班牙魔鬼追着我，该死的东西！”

“他不能死，要找到他！找到那些钱！”

“汤姆，永远找不到他了。一个人只有一次找到这么一大堆钱的机会，可这机会丢了。要是我再见到他，我准会吓破了胆。”

“可不是，我也一样。不过我反正想见到他，跟踪他——追到‘二号’。”

“二号，可不是。正是二号。我一直捉摸着这事儿。可就是摸不着头脑。你说那是什么意思？”

“我说不上，太玄乎了。哈克，兴许是房子号码！”

“好主意！——不，不是。要是的话，也不在这个偏僻的镇子上，这里的房子没门牌号码。”

“说对了。让我想想。对了——是房间的号码——知道吗，客栈里的客房号码！”

“哦，这下被你猜中了！这里只有两家客栈，咱们很快就能查清的。”

“你别走，在原处待着，哈克，等着我回来。”

汤姆很快就走了。他不想在大庭广众之下与哈克待在一起。他去了半小时就回来了。他在那家最好的客栈发现，二号房长期来一直由一名年轻的律师住着，现在还占着。而那家不怎么起眼的客栈的二号房很有些神秘。据客栈老板年轻的儿子说，那房间一直锁着，他没见有人进出，夜里怎么样他说不好。为什么会出现这情况，他不清楚。他是有点好奇，不过并没怎么放在心上。他想，这房间说不定在“闹鬼”吧。前天晚上他发现，房间里亮起过灯光。

“我查到的就这些，哈克。我看咱们要找的二号房就是那间。”

“我看也是那间，汤姆。那么你认为该怎么办呢？”

“让我想想。”

汤姆想了一会儿，说：

“告诉你。那个二号房的后门就通向客栈和那座破旧的老砖房之间的小巷子里。你这就把能找到的门钥匙全拿来。我也把姨妈的钥匙偷偷拿来。一到有个没月亮的黑夜，咱们就过去试试。你得留神印第安人乔，他说过，要再来镇子摸情况，找机会复仇。你一见到他，就紧跟着他。要是他不去二号，那儿就不是咱们要找的地方。”

“说真的，我可不想跟着他！”

“我说，那可是在黑夜里。他发现不了你——就是看见你也不会起疑心的。”

“好吧，要是在很黑很黑的夜里，我会跟着他的。我说不准，说不准。我试试吧。”

“我跟你打个赌，哈克，只要是黑夜，你准能跟住他！不是吗，要是他发现没机会报仇，那他就直接去拿那笔钱了。”

“是这么回事，汤姆，是这么回事。我去跟住他。老天爷，我一定跟住他。”

“有你这句话我就放心了。到时候可别说话不算数，哈克。我是说到做到的。”





第二十八章


当天晚上，汤姆和哈克做好了去历险的准备。他俩在那家客栈东转转西逛逛，忙乎到九点钟才走。他俩一个远远地监视那小巷；另一个守在客栈大门口。巷子里不见有人进出，进出客栈大门的人中，没一个像那西班牙人。看来那将是个月明星稀的夜晚。汤姆只好回家，他知道，要是天够黑，哈克准会来找他，学猫喵喵叫几声，他就偷偷出来，去试钥匙。可夜色一直很亮，哈克也在十二点钟撤了岗，钻进一只空糖桶睡了。

到了星期二两个孩子的运气也是很糟糕。星期三也一个样，星期四的夜可能会好些。汤姆瞅准机会，带上姨妈那盏铁皮旧提灯，灯上裹了层大毛巾，溜了出来。他把灯藏在哈克睡觉的空桶里，开始了监视。午夜前一小时，客栈关门了。里面的灯也灭了——那是附近唯一亮着的灯。不见西班牙人出没。巷子里也没人出入。一切都显得顺顺当当，如人所愿。黑夜伸手不见五指，万籁无声，只有偶尔从远处传来沉闷的雷声才打破四周的寂静。

汤姆拿过提灯，在空桶里点上灯，用毛巾紧紧裹上，两位冒险家趁着黑暗直向客栈而去。哈克守在巷口望风，汤姆摸索着进了小巷。有一段时间，哈克等得好不焦急，他只觉得心头有座大山压着，煞是难熬。他巴望着但愿能一见那提灯的闪光——虽然灯光会让他吓一跳，但能告诉他，汤姆还好好儿活着。汤姆走了仿佛有好几小时了。他准晕过去了；也许是死了；也许他的心脏吓得、紧张得破了。哈克在惴惴不安中，渐渐离巷口越来越近，事事都叫他担惊受怕，时时都觉得大祸临头，让他几乎喘不过气来。实际上他也吸不进什么气了，他只有微微的气可喘，因为他的心脏跳得极快，眼看着就要完蛋了。突然灯光一闪，汤姆从他身旁奔了过去。

“快跑，”他说，“快逃命！”

只这一句足矣，没等汤姆说第二遍，哈克拔腿就跑起来，速度之快，每小时达三四十英里之多。两个孩子跑呀跑，直跑到村口附近低处那座废弃了的屠宰场小棚子才停住了脚步。他俩刚进了安全的地方，倾盆大雨便下了起来。汤姆刚缓过劲来，便说：

“哈克，太可怕了！我尽量轻手轻脚地试了两把钥匙，可那要命的咔嗒咔嗒声响个不停，吓得我喘不过气来，可就是打不开锁。得，我糊里糊涂便抓住了门把，不料门竟开了！原来门没锁。我摸了进去，掀掉灯上毛巾，哟，老天爷！”

“什么——你见到了什么，汤姆？”

“哈克，我居然踩到印第安人乔的手上了！”

“哪能呢？”

“真的。他躺在地板上，睡得正沉。眼睛上还蒙着那破眼罩，双手摊开。”

“老天爷，你怎么办？他醒过来没有？”

“没有。他一动不动，我看是喝醉了。我抓起毛巾，拔腿就跑！”

“我敢说，换了我是不会想到毛巾的。”

“可我想到了。要是丢了毛巾，我姨妈饶不了我。”

“我说，汤姆，你见到那只箱子了吗？”

“哈克，来不及了，我压根就没朝四周看一下，我没见到那箱子，也没见到十字架。除了地板上印第安人身旁一只瓶子、一只洋铁皮杯子，我什么也没见到。可不，我还在房间里看到两只酒桶，和许许多多酒瓶子。现在你明白了吧，那闹鬼的房子里到底怎么回事？”

“怎么回事？”

“我说，是酒在作祟！兴许所有禁酒的客栈里都有那么一间客房会闹鬼，你说是不是，哈克？”

“可不，我看是这么回事。过去谁会想到这上面？我说，汤姆，这会儿印第安人乔醉倒了，现在咱俩不是可以去拿那只箱子了吗？”

“是吗？你倒去试试！”

哈克打了个寒战。

“哦，不——我看不行。”

“我看也不行，哈克。印第安人乔身旁只一只瓶子，那点酒是醉不倒他的。要是他喝了三瓶，他就会醉得不行，那时我可以去试试。”

两个人都不言语，过了好一会儿，汤姆开口说：

“听我说，哈克，印第安人乔不走，这事就别想试。太危险了。只要咱们夜夜守着，准保他迟早要出门的。到时候咱们就给他迅雷不及掩耳之势，把箱子拿过来。”

“得，我同意。我会整夜守着，夜夜守着，其他的事由你来办。”

“好，交给我得了。你要干的就是到胡珀街来喵喵叫几声——要是我睡着了，那就朝窗子扔几块小石子，就能唤醒我。”

“行，这是个好主意。”

“我说，哈克，雨停了，我这就回家了。几小时后天就开始亮了。这段时间你再过去看看，怎么样？”

“我说过，我会去的，汤姆，我准会去。我每夜都会盯上那客栈的，就盯上它一年。白天我睡觉，夜里去监视。”

“很好。你这上哪儿睡觉去？”

“本·罗杰斯家的干草棚里。他让我去的。他那黑人老爹杰克大叔也让我去。他要我给他提水，我就帮着他干。每次我跟他要吃的，只要省得下来，他都会给的。他可是个好心的黑人，汤姆。他喜欢我，因为我不会看不起他。有时候我干脆与他坐在一起吃饭，不过这事你可不能说出去。一个人饿极了，平常不愿干的事也会去干的。”

“好。要是白天我用不到你，你就睡觉去，我不会打搅你的。夜里要是发现什么事，立马来找我，喵喵叫几声。”





第二十九章


星期五早晨，汤姆听到的第一件事是个令人高兴的好消息——撒切尔法官一家人昨晚已回镇上了。印第安人乔和那些财宝，暂时便显得不那么重要了。汤姆的兴趣主要已集中在贝基的身上。他见过她，两个人与其他同学一起玩了“捉间谍”和“护水口”的游戏，玩得很开心，也很累。这一天最后添了个好消息，无疑是锦上添花：贝基缠着妈妈定第二天要举办野餐会，她妈妈答应了。说来这个野餐会是贝基早就许诺下的，却一推再推，终于要举办了。贝基别提有多高兴了。汤姆的高兴丝毫不亚于她。日落前，邀请书都已发出，村里的年轻人立即热情地投入准备工作，愉快地盼着好日子快快来到。汤姆兴奋得迟迟不能入睡，也巴不得哈克的喵喵声起，第二天好拿自己的财宝给贝基和参加野餐的人来个惊喜。但结果令他大失所望。当晚他没有收到任何信号。

早晨终于到来，快到十、十一点钟，法官撒切尔家聚了一大帮孩子，个个欢天喜地，吵吵嚷嚷。准备就绪，该动身去野餐了。大人们照例是不参加的，免得扫了他们的兴。已有数名十八岁的姑娘和二十三四岁的年轻先生的照料，孩子们的安全是用不着担心的。已给孩子们租下了那艘摆渡汽船。很快这一群兴高采烈的孩子，带着一篮篮吃食成群结队来到大街上。锡德病了，没能参加这场欢乐的聚会。玛丽留在家里照看他。撒切尔太太临别时交代贝基说：

“你们准会玩到天暗才回来，那今晚就住在渡口附近哪个姑娘家得了，孩子。”

“那我就跟苏茜·哈珀住在一起，妈妈。”

“很好。照顾好自己，注意守规矩，别惹麻烦。”

后来，大家欢天喜地走着的时候，汤姆对贝基说：

“跟你说吧，我们会干些什么——我们不去乔·哈珀家，直接爬上山，待在道格拉斯寡妇家。她家有冰淇淋呢！她几乎天天做冰淇淋——做了很多很多。她很乐意接待我们。”

“太好了！”

接着贝基想了想，说：

“那我妈会怎么说呢？”

“她怎么会知道？”

这女孩子反复想了想，说：

“我以为不太好——可——”

“可什么！你妈不会知道的。有什么好怕的？她只希望你平平安安，我可以保证，要是她事先想到了这主意，她准不会反对的。我知道，她准会同意。”

说寡妇道格拉斯热情好客的话很有吸引力，加上汤姆的一番劝说，贝基很快就动了心。于是两个人一拍即合，决定把晚上的活动瞒着其他人先不说出去。不久汤姆忽然想到，晚上哈克可能会来给他发信号，这一想让他的一份热情期盼大打折扣。可他怎么也不想轻易放弃在道格拉斯寡妇家度过的欢乐时光。他辩解道，干吗要放弃呢？昨天没来信息，干吗偏偏今晚会来信息？绝对有把握的快乐远比那不可靠的财宝重要多了。他到底是个孩子，所以便把全部心思都放在了这有强烈吸引力的玩乐上，把对那藏宝箱的牵挂暂时放在了一边。

渡船在离镇子三英里远的树木葱茏的山谷入口处抛了锚。一群人嬉嬉闹闹地上了岸。很快，远远近近的林子和高高的山冈，处处回荡着孩子们的欢声笑语，个个无不尽情玩乐，结果玩得又热又累，慢慢地孩子们三三两两转回营地，把带来的美食一扫而光，饱餐之后，在枝繁叶茂的橡树下或休息，或谈天。后来有人嚷了一句：

“谁愿意去钻山洞？”

全都愿意。大把大把的蜡烛拿了出来，大家纷纷开始爬山。洞口就在高高的山腰上，呈A字形，厚实的橡木门没有上锁。洞内是个小厅，冷飕飕像个冰窟窿。天然的洞壁全是坚固的石灰岩，冰冷的水珠淋漓。置身于这么黑黝黝的地方，眼望着身下阳光闪烁的青翠山谷，令人生发出一种异常的浪漫、神秘的情调。但是大家对环境的新鲜感很快就减退了，便开始七嘴八舌嚷嚷起来。有人点起了一支蜡烛，大家都拥到蜡烛前，接着开始了一场你来我往的英勇争夺战，害得蜡烛遭了殃，被打翻在地，熄灭了。于是又爆发出一阵欢声笑语，又开始一场你追我赶的游戏。不过凡事终有结束之时。大家便排着队一个个沿着主通道顺山坡下山去。一列摇曳的烛光朦朦胧胧投射在高高的山崖上，直达六十英尺高的两个山崖相接处。这条主通道宽最多八到十英尺，每隔几步就有更高更窄的裂隙向两边分叉出去，因为麦克道格尔岩洞是个迷宫，里面有许多弯弯曲曲的小道，有的相互交叉，有的不知通向哪里，据说在这错综复杂的裂隙和洞窟里转上几天几夜，也找不到洞的尽头。一直往下走呀走，走到了地底，迷宫下还是迷宫，不知哪里是尽头。没人完全了解这洞窟，没人能穷尽它。大多数年轻人对它只一知半解，习惯上，除了那些熟悉的部分，谁都不敢越雷池一步。汤姆·索亚对这洞穴不比别人多了解多少。

这一班人沿着主通道走了约四分之三英里，便三三两两溜进了岔道上去，沿着幽暗的小道飞奔起来，又在小道交汇处意外相遇；一批批人也可以在半小时之内互不见面，即使这样，他们也都活动在熟悉的区域之内。

不久孩子们三三两两先后回到洞口，个个气喘吁吁，喜气洋洋，从头到脚沾满烛油和泥土，无不为这一天玩得痛快而心满意足。只是觉得奇怪，竟没有发现时间过得这么快，眼看夜晚就要来临。船上的钟声已足足响了半个小时，这一天就这样结束，算来也是够浪漫，令人称心满意的。当满载着欢腾雀跃客人的汽船离岸起航时，除了船长，谁都不觉得刚才多耽误了一些时间、迟迟上船有多少可惜，那值几个小钱？

就在渡船的灯光一闪一闪经过码头时，哈克已上岗监视了。他没有听到船上的声响，因为那些年轻人已筋疲力尽，个个闷声不响，歇着了。他觉得很奇怪，这是条哪门子船，怎么不在码头停靠。后来他不再想这档子事，埋头干正事了。云渐渐浓起来，夜色越来越暗。到了十点钟，往来的车辆声听不见了，零零落落的灯光开始熄灭，稀稀拉拉的行人也不见了踪影，整个村子坠入了梦乡，只有这位小守夜人孤零零地与孤魂野鬼为伴。十一点了。那家客栈的灯光也灭了。这时四周一片漆黑。哈克还在这漫长而孤寂的黑夜中坚守着，但丝毫没有动静。他有些动摇了。再等下去有用吗？干吗不一走了之，睡觉去？

他听到了一声响。顷刻间他警觉起来。巷子里那扇门轻轻关上。他一步三跳奔到砖楼的一个拐角处。紧接着两个人从他身边一闪而过，一个人腋下像是夹着样东西。很可能是那箱子！他们准是在转移财物。现在能去叫汤姆吗？多荒唐——等他一来这两个人早已没了踪影，哪里再去找他们？不行，他一定要紧盯他们不放。他有信心，有黑暗作掩护，人家准发现不了他。他如此这般暗自琢磨之后，从拐角处走了出来，光着脚，单枪匹马，像只猫，紧跟在那两个人身后，始终与他们保持一定距离，看得见他们。

那两个人走过了河滨街上的三个街区后，向左转到了一个十字街头，然后径直向前走去，再折进通往卡迪夫山的一条小道，一路过去。他们过了半山腰威尔士老头的房子，脚不停步，直往山上去。哈克心想，老天爷，他们这是要把箱子埋在采石场吧。但是到了采石场，他们还是没有停步，继续往上走，往山顶去。两个人钻进高高的漆树丛，消失在黑暗中。哈克赶紧跟过去，缩短与他们的距离，这里他们说什么也发现不了他了。他快步跑了一段距离，又放慢了脚步，生怕跑得太快。接着往前去，又完全停了下来，听了听，没动静，除了似乎是自己的心跳声外，没别的声音。山上传来猫头鹰的叫声——那可是不祥之兆。但没有脚步声。老天，难道把他们搞丢了？他正准备拔腿去追，猛听到离他不到四英尺的地方有人轻声咳了一声！哈克紧张得心几乎要跳到嗓子眼了，但他硬是镇定下来，只是站在那里身子哆嗦个不停，简直就像十几场疟疾同时发作，害得他浑身无力，眼看着要瘫倒在地了。不过，他知道自己这时候所在的位置，这儿离寡妇道格拉斯家院子的台阶只有五步距离。“太好了。”他心想，“让他们把东西埋在这儿吧，找起来不难了。”

传来了一个声音——很轻的声音——是印第安人乔的声音。

“该死的！她这会儿可能有个伴。这么晚还亮着灯呢。”

“我什么灯也见不着。”

是那陌生人的声音——是在那闹鬼的房子里听到过的声音，哈克一听心头冷了半截。如此说来他们是来干复仇的勾当。他想逃开为妙。可一想道格拉斯寡妇曾不只一次关照过自己，而这两个家伙是来杀害她的。但愿自己能冒险去警告她一声。可他没有这胆量——他们会逮住他的。他这么想着，也想到了其他一些事，这时候那陌生人和印第安人乔一直在说着话，印第安人乔说的是：

“那是因为你眼前有树丛挡着——朝这儿看看，看见了？”

“看见了，我想，是有个人。还是不干了吧。”

“不干，我可是要离开这里永不再回来的！不干，那再也找不到机会了！我再跟你说一声，我说过，她那几个钱我才不在乎哩——你可以全拿去。可她的老公亏待了我——多次对我很凶，主要原因是他原是治安官，认定我是流民把我关进了班房。还有几千几万件，说也说不完！他用马鞭抽过我——在监狱里当众鞭打我，像鞭打黑奴一样的狠！当着全镇人的面鞭打我！鞭打——你明白吗？他占了我的便宜，死了。那这账就得让他老婆偿还。”

“哦，别杀了她！别这么干！”

“杀了她？谁说要杀了她？要是他活在这里，我杀的是他，可不是她。你想对女人报仇，用不着杀她——没有的事。我要坏了她的相貌。给她的鼻子来那么一刀，再割下她的耳朵，就像对付猪猡一样！”“老天，那——”

“用不着你来说三道四。放心好了，这不关你的事。我就把她绑在床上，她要是血流得多送了命，那不是我的错。她死了，我一滴泪也不会掉的。朋友，我只要你帮个忙——看在我的分儿上——所以我才带上你。我一个人可能干不了。要是你没那个胆量，我就宰了你，明白吗——要是逼得我杀了你，干脆连她也杀了，那样我看再也没人知道这事是谁干的了。”

“好吧，要是非得干，就动手干吧。越快越好——我浑身哆嗦着呢。”

“这就干？还有个人在的时候就干？听着，我先就怀疑上你了。不行——等到灯灭了的时候再动手。别急。”

接下去没人再说话了——哈克觉得，没人说话比有人在说杀人的时候更可怕。所以他屏住呼吸，悄悄往后退几步。他的脚小心翼翼地踩下去，先是战战兢兢地放下一只脚，身子东倒西歪，差点倒下去，平衡之后，才踩下另一只，待两脚站稳了，再往后退一步，两步。不料碰到一根树枝，啪地一响，吓得他大气也不敢出，听了听，没有动静——四周一片寂静。谢天谢地。他这才在高高的漆树丛中把身子转过来——转得小小心心，像是在调转船头，然后加快脚步，谨慎地朝前跑去。到了采石场这才感到安全了，便迈开灵活的小腿儿，飞奔起来。跑呀，跑呀，他快速地跑到了威尔士人的家，便砰砰砰地擂起了门，很快从窗子探出房主人和他两个壮实的儿子的头。

“吵什么吵？哪个在狠命地擂门？你想干吗？”

“让我进去——快！我全告诉你们。”

“我说，你是哪个？”

“哈克贝利·费恩，真是他！”

“哈克贝利·费恩，我想，听了这名字，许多人都不会开门的。还是让他进来吧，儿子。倒是看看到底出了什么事。”

“可别跟人说，是我告诉你们的。”哈克进门说的第一句就是这话，“请别说出去，要不我就没命了——那寡妇有时对我可好了，我想说的是——要是你们答应永远不跟人说是我报的信，我就说。”

“你看他，确实是有话要说，要不不会这个模样。”老人大声道，“说吧，这里没人会说出去的，小伙子。”

三分钟后，老人和他的两个儿子，全副武装，上山去了。很快就手拿家伙，蹑手蹑脚钻进了漆树丛。到了这里，哈克没有继续跟下去。他躲在一块大圆石后，翻身听了起来。四周悄没声息，时间似乎过得很慢。突然枪声响起，接着是一阵哭喊声。

哈克来不及细辨，便跳了起来，使出吃奶的力气，奔了起来。





第三十章


星期天一早，天刚蒙蒙亮，哈克就摸上山来，到了那威尔士人的家门前，轻声敲了起来。那一家人都还睡着。不过经头天晚上那一场惊心动魄的事件之后，他们睡得都很警觉，一有风吹草动就容易醒过来。很快窗口传来了问话声：

“哪个？”

哈克放低声音，战战兢兢回答说：

“请让我进去。我是哈克贝利·费恩。就我一个人。”

“孩子，听了这名字，无论是白天，还是黑夜，谁家的大门都会打开的。欢迎，欢迎！”

在这流浪儿听来，这些话语好不生疏，却是他向来最爱听的。过去，他从来没听到人家对他说过这样亲切的话。门很快打开，他走了进去。人家给哈克让了座。老人和他一对高大的儿子匆忙穿着衣服。

“孩子，我看你准是饿了。等太阳一出来，早饭就准备好了，咱们就可以吃上一顿热乎乎的饭了——别拘束。昨晚我和我儿子还指望你来这儿住一晚呢。”

“可把我吓坏了，”哈克说，“我撒腿就跑。枪声一响我就一溜烟地跑了，跑了三英里才停了下来。知道吗，这会儿我来是要打听打听到底怎么啦。天还未亮我就跑来是因为不想碰到那几个魔鬼，哪怕是他们死了我也不想见到他们。”

“我说，可怜的孩子，看来昨晚你遭了不少罪。吃完了饭你就在这儿睡上一觉吧。不，他们没死，孩子——我们心中很不好受。当时，根据你一番话，我们知道了去哪儿找到他们。我们蹑手蹑脚悄悄摸过去，到了离他们十五英尺远的地方——漆树丛黑得像个地窖，可我憋不住老想打喷嚏，算是撞上倒运了！我硬是忍呀忍呀，可没用——看来忍不住了，果然打了个喷嚏！我走在前头，手举着手枪，这下可好，一个喷嚏惊动了两个没心肝的家伙，哧溜一声从树丛中那边传过来，我赶忙喊起来：‘放枪，孩子们！’立即对着有声音的方向开了火。是我的孩子开的。可一眨眼，那几个坏蛋就溜了，我们随后就追，直追进林子里。我估计，没打中他们。他们开跑的时候，各开了一枪，可子弹嗖的一声从身旁过去，没伤着我们。待到我们听不见他们逃跑的脚步声，便不追了。后来我们下山把警官叫醒，他们召集了一队人，守住河岸，天一亮警官他们就会去搜山了。我家的两个孩子也要跟他们去。你要是能说说那两个坏家伙的模样，那会帮上大忙的。不过黑夜里，我看你没看清他们的模样吧？”

“不，我看清了，是在镇上看到，一直跟着他们。”

“好极了！仔细说来听听——仔细说说，孩子！”

“一个是又聋又哑的西班牙人，来过镇子一两次，另一个长得很难看，破衣烂衫——”

“这就足够了，孩子，我们认识这两个家伙！有天在寡妇家后面的林子里遇见过他们。他们溜了。孩子们，快走，这就去告诉警官。早饭明天再吃得了。”

威尔士人的儿子拔腿就走。见他俩要走，哈克跳起身子，嚷嚷道：

“哦，请别跟人说，是我揭了他们的底！哦，请别说！”

“听你的，哈克。你这次可是立了一功呀。”

“不，不，不！请别说出去！”

两个年轻人一走，威尔士老人说：

“他俩不会说的——我也不说。可你为什么不愿让人知道呢？”

哈克没多作解释，只是说，那两个家伙中，有一个他很早就对他的底细了解得一清二楚了，他不想让那人知道，自己了解一些对那人不利的事——那他们肯定要他的命了。

老人家再次保证不把秘密说出去，说：

“你怎么会跟踪那两个家伙呢，孩子？他们看上去很可疑？”

哈克没吭声，心里想着如何回答才稳当。他说：

“你是知道的，我是个挺坏的孩子——至少大家都这么说，我也没什么好说的——有时候我睡不着，琢磨着这事儿，想法子学学好。昨晚就是这样。我睡不着觉，就出来走走，三更半夜琢磨着这事儿，走呀走，走到那座禁酒客栈旁的旧砖房，身子靠在墙上寻思开了。就在这当儿，那两个家伙悄悄走过来，腋下夹着样东西，我估摸是偷来的。一个家伙抽着烟，另一个要借火，所以就在我面前停了下来。烟的火光照亮了他俩的脸，我看见那个大个子是又聋又哑的西班牙人，我是凭他那一脸的白胡子和眼睛上的眼罩认出来的，另一个穿得破破烂烂，凶神恶煞似的。”

“凭着点香烟的亮光就能看出他们穿得破破烂烂？”

哈克被问住了，好一会儿才回答说：

“可不是，我也说不准——可我有这种感觉。”

“于是他们就继续往前走，你便跟着——”

“跟着他们——没错。是这样。我想看看，到底是怎么回事——瞧他们偷偷摸摸的样子。我一直跟着他们到了寡妇家的台阶下，躲在黑暗中，听那穿破衣的人求那西班牙人放过寡妇，可西班牙人发誓要破寡妇的相，这些我是跟你们说过的——”

“怎么！那聋哑人说过这话！”

哈克再次犯了一个可怕的错，说漏了嘴！他原要想方设法不让老人知道那西班牙人的底细，可他的舌头决心要跟他作对似的，老让他出丑。他千方百计想摆脱这尴尬局面，可老人眼盯着他，害得他错误百出。威尔士人说了：

“孩子，你别害怕我，我说什么也不会伤你一根毫毛的。不——我要保护你——保护你。那西班牙人不是又聋又哑的。你无意中已说漏了嘴。再也瞒不过去了。你对那西班牙人的情况是了解一些的，只是不愿说出来。相信我——告诉我到底是怎么回事，相信我——我不会把你的秘密说出去的。”

哈克凝视着真诚的老人的眼睛，片刻后他身子凑过去，贴在对方的耳边，悄悄说：

“他不是西班牙人——他是印第安人乔！”

威尔士老人一听几乎是从椅子上跳了起来，立即说道：

“现在全明白了。听你说什么刺耳朵割鼻子的，我以为你这是在添油加醋哩，因为白人是不会用这种手段来复仇的。可他是印第安人！那就是另一码事了。”

吃早饭的时候，他俩一直聊着，那老人说，睡觉前他和儿子还做了一件事，那就是找来一盏灯，把台阶和附近仔仔细细查看了一遍，看有没有血迹。什么也没有，可看见了一大捆——

“什么？”

这几个字从哈克刷白的嘴唇间蹦了出来，速度之快，胜过电闪。他的眼睛张得老大老大，大气也不敢出——等着对方回答。威尔士老人见状大吃一惊，也瞪大眼睛望着他——过了三秒钟——五秒——十秒——他才回答：

“一捆盗贼用的工具。哟，你这是怎么了？”

哈克坐了回去，慢慢地、深深地喘着气。只觉得真该谢天谢地了。威尔士人好奇而又认真地看着他，说：

“不错，是捆工具。你好像大大地放心了。你怎么前后变化这么大？你以为我找到了什么？”

哈克离他很近很近，对方那探究的目光逼视着他——要是能找到说得过去的理由来回答就好了，可绞尽脑汁就是想不出来。那探究的目光盯得越来越紧，他便随口想到了这么一个糊涂借口——来不及仔细考虑，想以此来搪塞，轻声道：

“主日学校的课本吧。”

可怜的哈克这下可落到穷途末路的境地，再也笑不出来了，可老人听了乐得哈哈大笑起来，笑得浑身直哆嗦，笑到后来还说：这么一笑，就等于自己健健康康，从此口袋里的钱，永远也不会去孝敬什么医生了。后来他还说：

“可怜的傻小子，瞧你脸色发白，没一点精神，是不是病了吧？难怪慌慌张张，说话颠三倒四的。不过你会好起来的。我看歇息歇息，睡上一觉，就没事了。”

哈克直恨自己像只笨鹅，这么沉不住气，轻易就露了馅，被人怀疑上了。想当初在那寡妇家的窗前，他听到那两个家伙的谈话后，就不再把他们从客栈带出来的东西认作是财宝了。不过那只是他一时的想法，并不真的知道不是财宝，所以一听老人提到一捆东西，就情不自禁激动起来。不过总的来说，虽然发生了这么一段小插曲，他还是高兴的，因为现在他已确定，这捆东西非他所想的那包东西，所以大大放宽了心，又恢复了平静。事实上事事似乎顺顺当当。财宝还在二号，那两个家伙定能捉拿归案，关进牢房。他和汤姆当天晚上就能轻易取到那些金币，不怕有人插手了。

早饭刚吃完，响起了敲门声。哈克连忙躲了起来，他可不想让人看见，牵连进最近发生的事件中去，丝毫也不愿。威尔士人带进来几位先生和女士，其中就有道格拉斯寡妇。他说，这一班本镇市民要上山，想看看那台阶。昨晚的事已传开了。

威尔士人只好把昨晚的事跟来人说了说。寡妇因免遭迫害，也痛痛快快地把她的感激之情说了出来。

“千万别说这话，太太。别谢我和我的儿子，另外还有个人倒值得一谢呢。可他不愿让我提他的姓名。没有他我们还真的不会去那里呢。”

这话自然引起大家的好奇心，一时间把他们此来的正事也忘了。由于威尔士人欲言又止，害得来客越发好奇，通过他们，事儿传得全镇家喻户晓，可他就是守口如瓶，有关这秘密没透露半句。寡妇了解了其他的种种情况后，说：

“当时我正坐在床上，看一会儿书之后就睡着了，闹了这么大的响动也没惊醒我。你怎么不来唤醒我呢？”

“我们认为一时没这个必要。那些家伙不太可能再来了。他们把手头的工具都拉在了那里。干吗还要唤醒你，让你吓个半死？那以后我让三个黑奴守在你家周围看着。他们刚回来呢。”

来了更多的人，老人只好花了好多时间，把这故事讲了一遍又一遍。

正规学校放假期间，主日学校也放假。但大家还是很早就上教堂里来。这一轰动一时的事件已传得沸沸扬扬。有消息说，两个坏人没有找到。布道结束后，撒切尔法官的妻子在过道的人群中，碰到了哈珀太太，对她说：

“我家的贝基整天都在睡大觉吗？但愿她没累坏了。”

“你家的贝基？”

“是呀，”她惊得睁大了眼睛，“昨晚她没待在你家？”“没有。”

撒切尔太太脸色顿时发白，一屁股坐到了旁边的凳子上。这时波莉姨妈与一位朋友边走边说，正好路过，波莉姨妈说：

“早晨好，撒切尔太太。早晨好，哈珀太太。我家那个孩子也不见了。我以为昨晚他也待在你们家哩——其中的一家。今儿他不敢上教堂了。我可要好好治治他了。”

撒切尔太太无力地摇摇头，脸色越发苍白了。

“他没待在我们家。”哈珀太太说，显得不安起来。波莉姨妈也感到焦急了。

“乔·哈珀，今早你见过我家的汤姆没有？”

“没，太太。”

“你最后见到他是什么时候？”

乔使劲想了想，可就是想不出是什么时候。人们走出教堂，都停住了脚步，议论纷纷，个个开始显得焦虑不安起来。便焦急地盘问起孩子和年轻的老师。他们回答说没有注意到回来时汤姆和贝基是不是在渡船上。当时天已经黑了。没人想到问问是不是缺了人。后来一位年轻人脱口说出了自己的担忧，生怕汤姆和贝基还在山洞里！撒切尔太太听了顿时晕了过去。波莉姨妈哭喊起来，还拼命绞起了双手。

意外的消息一传十，十传百，五分钟之内警钟发了疯似的响起，惊动了全镇。顷刻间卡迪夫事件退居次位，不再被人注意了。那两个坏蛋暂时被遗忘。骑马的骑马，坐船的坐船，轮渡也出动了，恐惧的消息传出半小时，两百人之众陆路、水路，分头向山洞涌去。

整整一个下午，村子里空荡荡、静悄悄，死了似的。许多女人到波莉姨妈和撒切尔太太家，想方设法好言相劝，还跟她俩哭哭啼啼。说来哭泣比话语更能起点作用。整个单调乏味的晚上是在等待中度过的，到了天亮的时候，得到的消息无非是：“再送些蜡烛来，再送些食物来。”撒切尔太太简直疯了。波莉姨妈也好不了多少。撒切尔法官从山洞捎来的消息给人一点希望，令人鼓舞，但绝无真正的乐观可言。

那威尔士老人拂晓时回了家，满身的蜡烛油和泥土，累得筋疲力尽。他看见哈克还在为他准备的床上睡觉，发着烧，连连说着梦话。医生全到山洞去了，只好请寡妇道格拉斯来看护病人。她说她会尽心尽力守着他，因为不管他是好孩子，还是坏孩子，或是无足轻重的孩子，反正都是上帝的孩子，只要是上帝的孩子，都应该好好照看。威尔士老人说，哈克身上有不少优秀之处，寡妇说：

“这话说对了。那可是上帝的印记。他没有丢弃。从来没有。上帝创造的生灵少不了上帝留下的印记。”

快到中午时分，村子里那些体力不济的人陆续挣扎着回来，而身强力壮者则继续坚持搜寻。从所能得到的消息看来，洞中过去从未有人去过的深处都找过了，接着还要把每个角落和岩缝都搜寻个遍，这遍布迷宫里的小道，远远近近处处都有灯光闪烁，空旷阴森的走道里时时有喊叫声和枪声回荡。在一处人们寻常不去的地方，见到石壁上几个用烛火熏出来的字眼：“贝基”和“汤姆”，旁边还发现一根沾满烛油和泥土的缎带。撒切尔太太认出了那是贝基的缎带，为此还大哭了一阵。她说，这是自己的孩子留给她的最后遗物，没有什么比这更珍贵的纪念物了，因为这是那可怕的死神降落在她鲜活的生命前，她留下的最后东西。有人说，山洞里，远处时不时会有亮光闪过，接着一声声兴奋的喊叫响了起来，一二十人朝回荡着喊声的地方跑过去——结果都是令人心酸的失望。两个孩子不在那儿。那只是搜寻者的灯光。

接着是可怕的煎熬难耐的三天三夜，村子里的人无不处于绝望的麻木状态中。大家都无心干活。有人偶然发现，那家禁酒客栈的老板私藏烈酒，这本是件大事，但引不起公众多大的反应。哈克的精神偶尔有清醒的时候，有气无力地提到过该客栈，后来终于问起，隐约间非常担忧，在他害病期间，那家禁酒客栈是不是发生过什么事？

“发生过事。”寡妇答道。

哈克从病床上惊跳起来，眼睛睁得老大老大。

“什么？什么事？”

“烈酒——客栈因此关了。躺下，孩子。瞧你吓坏了我！”

“请告诉我一件事——就一件！是汤姆·索亚发现的吗？”

寡妇哭了起来。

“别说了，别说，别说，孩子。我不是跟你说过吗，你不能说话。你病得不轻，非常非常严重！”

好在只发现烈酒，要是发现了金币，那就热闹了。如此说来，财宝没了，永远找不到了。可她干吗哭哭啼啼起来呢？怪哩，她干吗哭呢？

这些想法在哈克的脑子里折腾了一阵，害得他感到非常疲劳，不觉睡了过去。寡妇自言自语道：

“他睡着了，可怜的孩子。说什么汤姆·索亚找到的！可惜的是没人能找到汤姆·索亚！唉，现在找到汤姆·索亚的希望不多了，也没足够的精力去找了。”





第三十一章


现在得回头说说有关野餐会上汤姆和贝基的事了。他俩与其他几名同伴一起沿着暗黑的通道游览了洞中那些熟悉的奇观异景——这些奇境都被人们冠以诸如“会客厅”“大教堂”“阿拉丁神宫”等等夸张的名字。后来他们玩起了捉迷藏的游戏。汤姆和贝基玩得很投入，尽兴了，这才感到很累很累，便手举着蜡烛，沿着弯弯曲曲的小道，边走边读着那些用烛烟熏在岩壁上的人名、日期、地址、格言警句等。他俩边走边聊，不知不觉间已到了岩壁上没有题字的地方，便在一块突出的岩壁上用烟熏上了各自的名字。写完了继续往前走。不久到了一个所在，一股细小的水流从突出的岩壁上汩汩淌下来，水中夹杂着一些细小的石灰石，日积月累，形成了一道晶光点点、万年不涸的瀑布，水花四溅，恰如镶着无数的花边。汤姆将自己瘦小的身躯，挤到水幕之后，用烛光照亮，让贝基看得更清楚。他发现，水幕后面、狭窄的峭壁之间有一段天然陡坡。他突然萌发雄心，想前去探险一番。贝基对此积极响应，并用烛烟留下记号，便于回来时认路，然后继续探险。两个人在洞内绕来绕去，来到神秘洞穴的深处，又在那里留下记号。接着进了一个岔道猎奇搜幽，回去后好向大家报告。他们在一处发现了一个宽敞洞厅，洞顶上悬挂下数不胜数的钟乳石，晶晶亮，长短粗细如同人腿。他们把这洞穴细细探看了一番，又惊讶又赞叹，最后从众多的小道中的一条退了出去。很快他俩眼前出现一泓令人心醉神迷的泉水，泉水下落处是个水池，池的四壁镶嵌着亮晶晶的霜花。水池位于洞窟的中央，支撑岩壁的是由许多巨大的钟乳石和石笋上下相连而成的柱子，神奇怪异，是多少世纪从不间断的滴水的结晶。洞顶下，聚集着成群成堆的蝙蝠，每一群有数千只之多，它们被烛光惊起，上百成千地吵吵嚷嚷，怒气冲冲地扑向蜡烛。汤姆懂得蝙蝠的习性，知道这会带来什么危险，急忙抓住贝基的手，跑进就近的一条小道。好不及时。就在贝基往洞外跑时，一只蝙蝠的翅膀扑灭了她手中的蜡烛，蝙蝠追了两个孩子好一段路，吓得这两个逃命者慌不择路，见路就钻，好不容易摆脱了这些危险的家伙。不久，汤姆发现了一个地下湖。长长的湖身往远处延伸，昏暗中见不到尽头。他想对这湖作一番探索，但觉得还是先坐下来歇息一会儿为好。这时候他俩才第一次感到这幽洞的寂静是何等的阴森恐怖。贝基说：

“哦，我竟没有注意到，已好久好久没听见其他人的声音了。”

“想到没有，贝基，咱俩是待在他们的底下——不知道离他们有多远，也分不清东南西北，待在这里能听得到他们的声音吗？”

贝基听了好不担心。

“不知道咱俩在这里待多久了，汤姆。不如回去吧。”

“不错，是得回去了。该回去了。”

“你认得路吗，汤姆？我觉得到处弯弯绕绕，已搞得我晕头转向了。”

“我想路我认得，可那些蝙蝠很难对付。要是咱俩的蜡烛都让它们给扑灭了，那就太糟了。还是另找一条路试试吧，这样就用不着经过那里了。”

“好吧，可我希望别迷路了。那就太可怕了。”贝基一想到可能会遭到这样的局面，不由得打了个寒战。

两个人进了一条通道，默默地走了好长一段路，每到一个出口，都打量一眼，看看是不是有眼熟的地方，可全是没见过的。每当汤姆查看道口时，贝基都注视他的脸，想见到一丝令人鼓舞的神色。而汤姆每每充满信心地说：

“哦，毫无问题。这虽不是咱俩要找的路，可很快就会出去的。”

但找呀找，都没有找到正确的路，他也觉得希望越来越渺茫了。后来他干脆不由分说，胡乱找了起来，见岔道就钻，也许能侥幸找到该找的路。这时候他嘴里还是说“毫无问题”，但心头像是灌了铅似的沉重，说出的话也没有原先那样爽朗，听来仿佛是说“全错了”。贝基胆战心惊，紧紧依偎在他身旁，使劲不让眼泪流出来，可就是忍不住。最后她说：

“哦，汤姆，别管那些蝙蝠吧。咱俩还是回原路！看来咱俩越来越糟了。”

汤姆停住了脚步。

“听！”他说。

一片深沉的寂静，静得连他俩不说话时都能听到彼此的呼吸声。汤姆喊了一声。喊声在一条条空荡荡的通道上回响着，到了远处渐次变弱，成了低微的嘲笑声。

“别再喊了，汤姆。太可怕了。”贝基说。

“是可怕，可我觉得还是喊喊好，贝基。知道吗，可能会被他们听到。”他说罢又喊了一声。

这“可能”两字比鬼怪的笑声还要恐怖，这无异于承认希望的破灭。两个孩子站着一动不动，听了起来。但毫无结果。突然，汤姆转身就走，脚步匆忙。但不久贝基从他犹豫不决的举动中看出另一个可怕的事实：他找不到回去的路了！

“哦，汤姆，你没留下过记号吗？”

“贝基，我蠢极了！我就没有想到过会往回走！我找不到路了。全乱套了。”

“汤姆，汤姆，咱俩迷路了！再也找不到离开这可怕的地方的路了。哦，为什么当初不跟大家在一起呢！”

她一屁股坐到了地上，号啕大哭起来，这一哭让汤姆不由想到，她说不定会死去，要么会发疯，吓得他呆了。他在她身旁坐了下来，双手搂住她，她把脸埋在他的胸口，依偎着他，向他倾诉自己的恐惧，倾诉自己于事无补的悔恨，而远处的回声在他们听来都变成了嘲弄的笑声。汤姆恳求她重新鼓起希望，她说办不到。他重责自己害得她陷入这么悲惨的境地。这番话很有作用。她说她要努力再次鼓起希望，她要振作起来，只要他不再说那样的话，不管他带她到哪里，她都跟着他走。她说，她也该受到同样的责备。

于是两个人继续走下去——漫无目标——简直是乱走一气——他们所能做的就是走着走着，不停地走着。不久，他俩似乎又燃起了希望之光，倒不是有什么理由来支撑，完全是因为希望之源既然未被岁月和频频的失败所阻，那么希望自然而然会复苏。

过了一会儿，汤姆拿过贝基的蜡烛，吹灭它。这一节约的举措大有好处。这是不言而喻的。贝基明白其深意。她又感到希望破灭了。她知道汤姆口袋里有整整一根蜡烛，外加三四根用了半截的——可他还得省着用。

慢慢地疲劳开始显威。两个孩子竭力不加理会，虽然多么想坐下来，但那是多么可怕。因为时间很宝贵，只能朝前走，不论朝哪个方向，走下去就有进展，就有所获，而坐下去无异于坐以待毙，缩短死亡来临的时间。

最后贝基累得再也迈不开步了，便坐了下来。汤姆也跟着她坐下来歇息。他俩谈起了家，谈起了朋友，也谈到了舒适的床铺，特别是灯光！贝基哭开了，汤姆想方设法安慰她，但鼓励的话一说再说，说多了变得软弱无力，听来反成了挖苦了。贝基感到精疲力竭，不觉睡了过去。汤姆反而感得欣慰。他坐着端详起她扭曲的脸庞。在美梦的作用下，那脸又变得平滑而自然，慢慢地漾起了丝丝笑意，久久没有消逝。这面容是何等的安详，也感染了汤姆，他的心灵也跟着平和下来，他的思绪不觉转到了往事和种种梦幻般的记忆之中。就在他沉醉于静思之中，贝基醒了，且轻声一笑，但笑声即刻在她唇边冻结住了，紧接着是一声叹息。

“哦，我怎么能睡着呢！我多么希望别醒过来就好了！不，不，汤姆，别这样看着我！我不再说了。”

“你睡着了，我挺高兴的，贝基。你已经休息了一会儿，不再那么累了吧。咱俩这就找路去。”

“咱俩可以试试，汤姆。我刚才在梦中去了一个非常美丽的国家，我想咱俩就要去那里了。”

“说不定不去那里，不去那里。提起精神来，贝基。咱俩这就去找路。”

两个孩子站起身，手拉着手，无望地慢慢走下去。他俩估算着在洞穴里已待了多长时间，却拿不准是几天，还是几星期。不过显然没有这么久，因为手头的蜡烛还没点完呢。此后过了很长一段时间——说不准有多长——汤姆说，现在脚步要放轻些，好听到滴水声——他们必须要找到一处泉水。很快就找到了。汤姆说该再次休息了。两个人实在太累了，但贝基说，她认为自己可以接着走会儿。可汤姆说他不同意，贝基觉得挺奇怪，她想不通。两个人坐了下来。汤姆用些泥土将蜡烛固定在面前的石壁上。两个人忙着想心事，好一会儿没人说话。后来还是贝基先开口，打破了沉默：

“汤姆，我好饿！”

汤姆从口袋掏出样东西。

“你记不记得这是什么？”

贝基差点没笑出声来。

“这是你我的结婚蛋糕呀，汤姆。”

“说对了。要是它有木桶那么大就好了，因为现在咱俩只有这点了。”

“我是野餐时省下留作纪念的，汤姆。就像大人对待结婚蛋糕那样——可现在它成了咱俩——”

贝基只说到这里便不说下去。汤姆把蛋糕一分为二。贝基吃得津津有味，很快就吃完了。汤姆却一口一口慢慢吃着自己的一份。吃了蛋糕想喝水，水有的是。汤姆和贝基都说该接着走了。汤姆沉默了一会儿，便说：

“贝基，我要跟你说句话，你听了受得了吗？”

贝基的脸色刷地变得苍白，不过她说，她想受得了。

“那好，贝基，这里有的是水，咱俩就待在这里不走了。咱俩剩下的就是这一小截蜡烛了！”

贝基忍不住失声痛哭起来。汤姆生着法子安慰她，但没有用。最后贝基说：

“汤姆！”

“怎么，贝基？”

“他们丢了咱俩，会来找吗？”

“会的，一定会来找。当然会来找。”

“说不定这会儿就在找呢，是不是，汤姆？”

“我想他们可能在找！希望他们在找。”

“他们是在什么时候发现咱俩不见了的呢，汤姆？”

“我估计他们是在回船上的时候。”

“那时候天大概暗了——那么他们能注意到咱俩不在吗？”

“我说不上。不过他们一回到家，你妈妈一定会发现你没回来。”

汤姆一见贝基脸上露出恐惧的神色，就意识到，他犯了个天大的错误，那就是当晚贝基原本就是不准备回家的！两个孩子一时陷入了沉默，想着心事。不一会儿贝基突然露出伤心的神色，让汤姆感到，他与贝基的想法居然不谋而合——待撒切尔太太发现贝基不在哈珀家，星期天上午差不多要过去一半了。

两个孩子眼睛紧紧盯着最后一小截蜡烛，眼看着它慢慢无情地短下去，最后只剩下短短的半英寸烛芯了。微弱的火焰忽升忽落，化成一缕轻烟腾空而去，在烟柱顶盘桓片刻，然后——四周即刻笼罩在令人心惊肉跳的黑暗之中。

两个孩子谁也说不准，多久之后，贝基才慢慢地清醒过来，意识到自己躺在汤姆的怀中哭泣着，他俩只知道，经过一段似乎非常漫长的时间，他们都从死去一般的昏睡中醒过来，再度陷入悲痛之中。汤姆说现在恐怕已到星期天了——说不定是星期一了。他试着让贝基说话。可她太伤心了，她完全绝望了。汤姆说，他俩迷路的时间也许很久了，大家肯定都在找寻他们。他一定要大声喊叫，也许会被人听到，过来找他们。他试着喊了喊。但黑暗中远处的回声听来令人心惊肉跳，他就不喊了。

时间又白白地过去了几小时，饥饿再次折磨这两个陷于困境中的孩子。汤姆那一半蛋糕还剩下一点，两个人便分了吃。这反而感到更饿了。少得可怜的一点食物反而激起他俩更强的食欲。

过了一会儿，汤姆说：

“嘘！你听到了吗？”

两个人都屏声敛息听了起来。似乎听到了远处一声极轻微的呼唤声。汤姆立即回了一声，然后拉起贝基的手，沿着小道朝那个声音传来的方向摸索过去。他又听了听，又听到了，显然，他俩离那呼唤声更近了。

“是他们！”汤姆说，“他们来了！跟我来，贝基——咱俩现在没事了！”

两位落难中人喜出望外，但他俩跑得很慢，因为脚下处处是坑坑洼洼，得特别留神才是。很快他俩遇到了一个坑，不得不停住脚步。坑深可能三英尺，也有可能一百英尺哩——怎么也跨不过去。汤姆趴了下去，手尽量往下伸，就是摸不到底。两个人只好待在那里不走，等待寻找他们的人过来。他俩再次听起来。远处的呼唤声明显地离得越来越远！不一会儿，那声音完全听不到了。两颗心顿时变得悲痛欲绝。汤姆拼命呼喊起来，喊得嗓子哑了。可没用。他给贝基打气。就这样在焦急地等待中，像是等了一个世纪之久，可再也等不来任何声息。

两个孩子又摸索回泉水边。时间过得很慢很慢，等得人更感疲乏。他俩又睡着了。醒来后更感饥肠辘辘，痛苦难当。汤姆肯定说，这时候必是星期二了。

他猛生出一个念头。附近不是有几条岔道吗，与其白白坐等时间过去，不如去岔道探索一番。他从口袋里掏出一卷风筝线，绑在一个凸出物上，接着便与贝基行动起来。汤姆在前领路，边走边放线。走了二十步，便是岔道的尽头，是“起始的地方”，汤姆跪了下去，伸手摸索起来，尽量往拐角处摸。他把手往右远远伸出去，就在这时，离他不到二十码的地方，从一块岩石后面伸出一只拿着蜡烛的手！汤姆高兴得大叫一声。紧接着出现了一个人，他不是别人，就是——印第安人乔！汤姆惊呆了，动弹不得。可是令他庆幸的是接着他看见那西班牙人拔腿就跑，跑得无影无踪。汤姆想不通，印第安人乔怎么听不出他的声音，过来要他的命，怪他曾在法庭上作证。恐怕是洞内的回声改变了他的嗓音。他觉得是这个道理。他已吓得浑身没半点力气。他心想，要是自己有足够的体力回到泉水边，乖乖地待在那里，任什么都别想诱惑得动他敢冒与印第安人乔遭遇的危险了。他小心地不让贝基知道见到印第安人乔的事。他跟她说，他只是想碰运气才喊的。

但是时间一长，两个人已是饥肠辘辘，疲劳不堪，再也顾不得恐惧了。他俩在泉水边又苦苦坐等了一段时间，睡了一会儿，醒来后，情况有了变化。两个孩子醒后饥饿难当。汤姆认为现在是星期三，或星期四，甚至是星期五或星期六了。人家再也不来搜寻了。他提议到另一条道探索探索。他甘愿冒遇到印第安人乔和其他的风险。但贝基已非常虚弱，陷入了可怕的麻木状态，怎么也提不起她的劲来。她说，她情愿待在原地等死——死期不会太远了。她请汤姆要是愿意的话，带着风筝线再去试探试探，但她求汤姆去一会儿后，再回来与她说说话，并要汤姆答应，在那可怕的时刻到来的时候，他就在她身旁，握着她的手，直到最后一切结束。

汤姆亲了亲她，喉咙里一阵哽咽。可他表现得信心十足，装得一定能找到搜寻的人、让他俩脱离洞穴的样子。然后他拿着风筝线，手脚并用，跪着摸索着另一条岔道。可是饥饿已折磨得他苦不堪言，加上为死亡将至而担惊受怕，他的前景非常不妙。





第三十二章


已是星期二下午，渐渐到了黄昏时分。圣彼得斯堡村仍然陷入悲痛之中。两个失踪的孩子踪影全无。已为他俩举行过公共祈祷。不少人私底里也为他们虔诚地祈祷，表达了自己的一片心意。但从山洞里没有传来什么好消息。大多数搜寻的人已停止了寻找，回来投入到日常事务中，都说，两个孩子显然已无生还的希望了。撒切尔太太病得很重，大多数时间处于昏迷状态。大家说听到她呼唤女儿的名字，都抬起头来，足足听了一分钟之久，然后再次无力地垂下了头，发出声声呻吟，此情此景叫人好不心碎。波莉姨妈神情委顿，悲凉凄苦，灰白的头发差不多已是一片白霜。星期二晚上，村里的人怀着悲伤而凄凉的心情各自歇息去了。

就在这午夜时分，村里教堂的钟发了疯似的响了起来。顷刻间，街道上满是衣冠不整的人，疯狂地嚷嚷着：“出来！出来！他俩找到了！找到了！”喧闹的人声中夹杂着铁盘敲打的叮当声和号角的呜呜声。人们成群结队拥向河边，迎接两个孩子归来。他俩坐在一辆敞篷车里，拉车的人大声嚷嚷，村民们挤挤挨挨拥着车子，一起往回走。浩浩荡荡的队伍走在大街上，欢呼声经久不息。

村子里灯火通明，谁也不回去睡觉。这是小村子前所未有的最重大的一个夜晚。开头半小时，村民们川流不息地来到撒切尔法官家，对两个被救的孩子又是搂，又是抱，又是亲，又是吻，紧握撒切尔太太的手，想说几句话，硬是说不出来。出来时已泪如雨下，洒得地上一片湿。

波莉姨妈高兴到了极点，撒切尔太太也不甘落后。不过说撒切尔太太高兴到极点，此时还差一步，那就是要等有人把这天大的喜讯送到山洞里告诉她丈夫，才算是功德圆满。汤姆呢，此时就躺在沙发上，身边围着大群人，热切地听他讲述山洞里奇妙的经历，内中自然少不了几分加油添醋，最后说到他如何离开贝基，作了一番探险；如何顺着两条通道往前走，直到风筝线全部放完才止步；后来又如何去了第三条通道，直走到风筝线不剩了；就在他打算往回走的时候，他如何忽然看见远处有个亮点，像是天光；他如何放掉风筝线，摸索着向小亮点过去；他最后如何连头带肩从一个小洞口钻出来，眼前竟是奔腾着的宽广的密西西比河！要是那发生在夜里，他就看不到那亮光，也就找不到出路了！他又说到，他如何回去接贝基，告诉她这好消息，可她反而要他别拿这种小事来烦她，因为她太累了。她知道自己快要没命了，她很想这就死去。他还描述了他如何费尽口舌终于说得她相信；当她摸索着爬去，看见那蓝色的天空，又是如何的欢天喜地；说到他如何爬出洞，接着帮着她也爬了出来；他俩如何高高兴兴坐在洞外呼喊着；有几个人如何坐着小船过来；汤姆如何招呼他们，对他们诉说了自己的遭遇，还说两个人饿坏了；那些人起初对这离奇的故事不相信，“因为，”他们说，“那山洞是在河下的山谷底下，你们待的地方是在离河的下游五英里的地方”。后来他们如何让他俩上了船，带他们到了一户人家，让他俩吃了晚饭，然后休息到了天黑后两三个小时，最后带他俩回家。

撒切尔法官和其他进洞搜寻的人都在身后留下绳索，天亮前，上山送信的人借着绳索找到法官他们，把这大喜讯告诉了他们。

汤姆和贝基很快发现，在山洞里三天三夜的劳苦和饥饿造成的伤害不是一下子就能恢复过来的。整个星期三和星期四，他俩都躺在床上，越躺越疲惫不堪。星期四汤姆下床走动走动，星期五去了趟镇里。星期六则整天不着家了。贝基则足不出户，到了星期天，她还是像生过一场大病，脸色十分难看。

汤姆听说哈克病了，星期五去看望过他，可他们不让他进房，星期六和星期天他也没和哈克见过一面。星期天之后，他被允许天天可以见哈克了，但警告他不可谈自己的历险，也不可涉及令哈克激动的话题。道格拉斯寡妇就待在一旁监视他遵不遵守禁令。汤姆听家里人说起卡迪夫山的事件，也听说轮渡附近河里发现一个穿得破破烂烂的人的尸体，说是也许那人是企图逃跑时淹死的。

汤姆从山洞获救后两星期，去看望哈克。哈克的健康已大有好转，可以听听令人激动的话题了。汤姆有些有趣的话要告诉他。撒切尔法官的家就在去找哈克的路上，他也就顺道看望了贝基。法官和他的几位朋友要汤姆说说自己的事，有人忘不了讽刺他几句，问他想不想还要到山洞去。汤姆说还要去，再去一趟算不了什么。法官说：

“是呀，不乏跟你一样的人，汤姆。这我不怀疑。但我已有所防备，再也不会有人在山洞里失踪了。”

“为什么？”

“因为两星期前，我已经用厚铁板把洞门封严实了，还加了三把锁——钥匙就掌握在我手里。”

汤姆的脸刷地白得像死人一般。

“你这是怎么了，孩子？来人哪，快！快拿杯水来！”

水拿来了，往汤姆的脸上一泼。

“啊，这下没事了。你倒是怎么了，汤姆？”

“哦，法官，印第安人乔就待在山洞里！”





第三十三章


没过数分钟，消息传了开去，十多条小船载着人朝麦克道格尔山洞进发，紧跟着的是满载乘客的渡船，汤姆·索亚待在撒切尔法官坐的小船里。

山洞的门开启后，眼前昏暗处出现了一幅悲惨的景象。印第安人乔直挺挺地倒在地上，已经死了。他的脸紧贴着门缝，他那双充满渴望的眼睛直到生命的最后一刻，还盯着门外那光明、自由的欢乐世界。汤姆感慨万分，因为根据他自身的经历，知道这可怜的家伙受了多大的罪。他动了恻隐之心，同时又有一种从此得以解脱、确保安全的感觉，他深深体会到，自从那天，他终于大声指控这个嗜血成性的流浪汉以来，他所承受的负担有多沉重。这是他过去没有完全意识到的。

印第安人乔的博伊刀就放在他身旁，已断成了两截。大门底部的横木被刀削开了一个口子，虽然他使尽了力气，还是无济于事。因为洞门外的门槛是块天然的岩石，刀很难对付这样坚固的东西，自身反而断了。不过即使没有这块岩石挡着，横档完全被挖掉，印第安人乔也无法钻出门底，他只是一番瞎起劲。这点他也明白。他之所以这么折腾，只是为了找点事干，只是为了消磨那无聊的时间，好让自己的大脑少受折磨。通常，人们在洞门口可以找到游客插在缝隙里的五六根蜡烛，现在已没有了。是久困洞内的印第安人乔拿去吃掉的。他想方设法捉来过几只蝙蝠，也吃掉了。只留下蝙蝠的爪子。这可怜虫是活活饿死的。附近有一根石笋，从地面往上慢慢长了不知多少年了，是从顶上的石块下滴的落水形成的。那困兽打断了石笋，又在一块石头上挖出一个浅凹洞，放到石笋的断裂处，用来接住下落的宝贵水滴，水滴声单调，很有规律，每三分钟才落下一滴——一天一夜才积得下一汤勺。这水滴早从金字塔建成时就开始下滴了，历经特洛伊城被攻陷、罗马城奠基、耶稣被钉上十字架、“征服者”创建不列颠帝国、哥伦布航海、列克星敦大屠杀还是“新闻”的时候，一直不断地滴着，滴着，如今仍然在滴。今后，当所有这些历史事件已是“时至午后”，传统“日薄西山”、最终被漫漫黑夜所吞没，它仍在滴着，滴着。凡事都有各自的目的和使命吗？这水滴耐心地滴了五千年难道就是为了满足这个游手好闲的可怜虫的需要吗？在未来的一万年间，它是否还有别的重要的目标有待实现？我们且不去管它。自从那个不走运的混血儿在石上挖洞接宝贵的水滴以来，已过了许多年了，时至今日，游客来到麦克道格尔山洞欣赏奇观时，对那块可怜的钟乳石和那缓慢下落的水滴始终久久凝视，流连忘返。印第安人乔用过的杯子被列入山洞的奇景的榜首，连“阿拉丁的神宫”也无法与之媲美。

印第安人乔被埋在洞口附近。方圆七英里的人从乡镇、村庄、农场或坐船，或乘大车，携儿带女，带上食物，纷纷拥来。他们毫不讳言，看着印第安人乔下葬，跟看着他被吊死一样称心满意。

这场葬礼同时也阻止了另一事件的进展——有人向州长请愿，要求赦免印第安人乔。在请愿书上签名的人不在少数。为此开过多场会，会上人们痛哭流涕，慷慨陈词，一批傻里傻气的女人还组成了一个请愿团，面见州长，身穿丧服，围着他，哭哭啼啼，请他大发慈悲，置自己的职责于不顾。他们相信，据说，印第安人乔杀害过五名村民，可这算得了什么？就算他是魔鬼撒旦，也会有许多低能儿甘愿在请愿书上签名。他们那一双双眼睛，像漏了水的龙头，无休止地掉下眼泪，洒到请愿书上。

葬礼后的那天上午，汤姆把哈克领到一个偏僻的地方，进行了一场重要的交谈。这时哈克已从威尔士人和道格拉斯寡妇那里了解到汤姆的全部历险，但汤姆认为，有一件事他们没有告诉哈克，他就是为这事来找他的。看起来哈克觉得很难受，他说：

“我知道是什么事。你去过二号，除了威士忌酒，什么也没找到。没人告诉我说你去过，可我一听说私藏威士忌酒的事发，就知道跟你有关。我知道你没找到钱，因为这事就是你对别人瞒着，也会想着法子来告诉我的。汤姆，我早就觉得，这笔钱咱俩永远也得不到了。”

“怎么啦，哈克，我可没告发过客栈老板。你是知道的，星期六我去野餐的时候，那家客栈还是好好的。你忘了那天晚上你不是去监视的吗？”

“哦，对了！这像是一年前的事了。就在那天晚上我跟踪印第安人乔一直到了寡妇家。”

“你跟踪他了？”

“是的——你可别说出去。我估摸着印第安人乔背后有人帮着他。我不想让他们缠上我，对我下毒手。要不是我，这会儿他就安安生生待在得克萨斯了。”

说罢哈克把自己的历险一五一十告诉了汤姆，此前汤姆只听说过有关威尔士人那一部分事。

“我说，”哈克又回到原先的话题，“哪个偷偷拿走了二号的威士忌酒，那些钱就是哪个拿的。在我看来，那钱咱俩反正是拿不到手了，汤姆。”

“哈克，那钱一直不在二号里！”

“什么！”哈克紧盯着对方的脸，想看出个究竟来，“汤姆，你又知道那笔钱的下落了？”

“哈克，钱就在山洞里。”

哈克一听眼睛炯炯发亮。

“再说一遍，汤姆！”

“钱就在山洞里。”

“汤姆，你得说老实话——你这是跟我闹着玩的吗？”

“我是认真的，哈克——我这辈子没撒过谎，这次也一样。你愿不愿跟我一起进洞，帮我把钱拿到手？”

“我发誓，我愿意！只要一路上做上记号，免得迷路，我就去。”

“哈克，这回进洞绝不会遇到丝毫麻烦。”

“好极了——你怎么这样有把握定能找到钱？”

“哈克，等到进了洞再说。要是找不到，我情愿把我的鼓和其他所有的东西全给你。我发誓，准给。”

“那好——一言为定。你说，什么时候去？”

“你说什么时候就什么时候。你身体吃得消吗？”

“在洞很深处吗？最近三四天我能走动走动了。不过超过一英里的路还不行，汤姆，至少我觉得还不能走更远的路。”

“哈克，除了我，谁都要走上五英里才能到那里。可我知道一条捷径，这路谁也不知道，哈克。我领着你坐船去。我可以划着船过去，回来时也由我来划，全由我一人干，用不着你动手。”

“这就去，汤姆。”

“好。咱们还得带上些面包和肉。还要捎上烟斗，一两只小袋子，两三根风筝线，还有人说的摩擦火柴这新鲜的玩意儿。跟你说吧，上次在洞里，我就多次巴望着有那玩意儿了。”

刚过晌午，两个孩子向一位不在家的村民“借”了条小船，便动身上路了。到了“空洞”下方数英里的河面上，汤姆说：

“你看，‘空洞’以下的那一片峭壁，看起来都一个样，没房子，没堆木场，灌木丛全都一模一样。可你看见那边有个倒塌的地方，白白的，那就是我做的一个记号。咱们上岸去。”

两个人登上了岸。

“你瞧，哈克，咱俩站的地方，离当初我钻出来的那个小洞也就一根钓鱼竿的距离了。这会儿看你能不能找到它。”

哈克举目东找西望，就是没发现。汤姆大模大样地大步走进一片茂密的漆树丛，说：

“不就是这儿吗！你瞧，哈克。这是这一带最隐蔽的一个洞了。你可不能说出去。我一直想当强盗，可得有个这样的地方。叫人头疼的是哪里找得到呢。现在咱俩有了。得保密才行。只能让乔·哈珀、本·罗杰斯知道——当然是如果他俩肯入伙，咱们结成一帮，要不就没戏。管它叫‘汤姆·索亚帮’，听起来挺棒的，是不是，哈克？”

“可不是，挺棒，汤姆。那咱们打劫谁？”

“哦，谁都行。拦路打劫，多半是这法子。”

“杀了他们。”

“不——不全杀掉。把他们关在洞内，交了赎金才放人。”

“啥是赎金？”

“钱。你要他们交出所有的钱，让自己的朋友送来。要是哪个凑不齐钱，就关他一年，然后杀了。一般都这么做。只是不杀女人。她们都长得漂漂亮亮，很有钱，胆子又小。抢她们的手表和东西，可说话时始终要把自己头上的帽脱下，对她们讲究礼貌。数强盗最讲礼貌了——我的书上就这么写的。这不，女人后来慢慢地爱上了你，她们就在山洞里待上一两个星期，从此不再哭哭啼啼了，你怎么也撵不走她们。要是你逼她们走掉，一转身她们就回来了。所有的书里都这么写的。”

“可不是，太棒了，汤姆。我相信这比当海盗强多了。”

“说对了，在有些方面是强多了，因为离家近，想看马戏也可以看。”

说话间，一切准备就绪，汤姆领先，两个孩子进了洞。他俩费力地到了洞的一头，牢牢地拴好了风筝线，继续往前走。走了几步，到了泉水边。汤姆浑身上下不禁打了个寒战。他让哈克看了看那段插在石壁上一团泥土里的蜡烛芯，细细讲了当时他和贝基眼看着烛光如何摇摇晃晃，最后熄灭的情景。

两个孩子压低声音，悄悄说起话来。因为周围一片昏暗，静悄悄的，他们的神经受到了压抑。两个人继续往前走。很快到了汤姆曾探索过的另一条道。那就是“起始的地方”。借着烛光一看，原来前面并没有什么峭壁。只是个高约二三英尺、有点陡的泥堆。汤姆悄声说：

“现在我让你看样东西，哈克。”

他举高蜡烛，说：

“你尽量往远处那个角落看，看见了？那边那块大石块上——烛烟熏出来的。”

“汤姆，是个十字架！”

“你知道二号在哪里吗？‘十字架下’，记得吗？就在那里，我看见印第安人乔伸出拿着蜡烛的手，哈克！”

哈克凝神看了看那神秘的符号，声音颤抖地说：

“汤姆，咱俩赶紧离开这儿吧！”

“怎么？财宝不要了？”

“是的，留下它吧。印第安人乔的阴魂就在那儿转悠。准在。”

“不，没有的事，哈克，没有的事。阴魂只能在人死去的地方转悠——远远地在洞口——离这儿有五英里远。”

“不，汤姆，不是这回事。阴魂老围着钱转。我知道鬼魂老这样。你也是知道的。”

汤姆觉得哈克说得不错，也害怕起来了，变得犹豫不决起来。突然他脑子里闪过一个想法。

“我说，哈克，咱俩可是成了大傻瓜了。印第安人乔的阴魂怎么能到十字架下呢？”

这话说得有理，立刻见效。

“汤姆，我就没想到这个。是这样。有了十字架，咱俩算是碰上好运了。咱们这就爬下去，把那箱子找出来。”

汤姆走在前头，边爬边在上面草草挖出踏脚来。哈克随后。小石洞里立着一块大石头，四条岔道向外延伸出去。两个孩子细细地查看其中的三条，看不出什么结果来。最后在最靠近大石块脚下的那条岔道发现了一个小凹洞，里面铺着一条毯子，还有一根旧吊索，一些熏肉皮，一些被啃得干干净净的骨头。没有钱箱。两个孩子把这里搜了个遍，毫无结果。汤姆说：

“他说在十字架下。哦，这儿离十字架最近了。总不能在岩石底下吧，因为那石块是牢牢长在地上的。”

他俩又到处搜寻了一遍后，灰心丧气地坐了下来。哈克没了主意。后来汤姆说：

“听我说，哈克，岩石的一侧有几个脚印，还有几滴蜡烛油。可其他地方没有。这是怎么回事？我跟你打个赌，钱准在石头下。我要把土刨开看看。”

“这主意不赖，汤姆！”哈克兴致勃勃，说。

汤姆立即掏出自己那把“道地的巴罗刀”，还没刨四英寸深，就碰到了木头。

“嗨，哈克，听到了没有？”

哈克也开始又是挖又是刨起来。很快就露出一些木板来。他俩搬开了木板。这几块木板原本盖住一个通向石头下面的洞口。汤姆钻了进去，手中的蜡烛尽量往岩石底下照，还说，他没见着小洞的尽头。他主张进去探索一番。他弯下腰钻了进去。眼前出现一条狭窄的小道，渐渐往下延伸。他沿着弯弯曲曲的小道走下去，先是向右，接着左转，哈克随后跟着。慢慢地过了一段不长的弧形小路，汤姆嚷了起来：

“老天爷，哈克，瞧这里！”

正是那只宝箱，放在一个隐蔽的小洞里，洞里还有一只空的火药桶、两支装在皮套里的枪、两三双印第安人的旧鹿皮靴、一根皮带，此外还有一些破烂货，都让岩石滴下的水滴浸得湿透了。

“终于拿到手了！”哈克一只手伸进失去光泽的钱堆里乱抓。“天哪，咱俩发财了，汤姆！”

“哈克，我一向认为咱们会成功的。太好了，简直叫人无法相信，可还是拿到手了，真的！我说，别在这里傻待了，搬走吧。让我来试试，能不能搬动这箱子。”

箱子约莫有五十磅重，汤姆使出吃奶的力气才勉强提起它，可要搬走不容易。

“不出我所料，”他说，“那天在闹鬼的房子里看见他们拿走时也挺费劲的。看来我带几只袋子来还是做对了。”

钱币很快就装进袋子。两个孩子拿着袋子上到了画着十字架的岩石下。

“咱俩这就把枪和其他东西也拿上。”哈克说。

“不，哈克，让那些东西留在那儿吧。哪天咱俩去当强盗，就派上用场了。一直留在那儿，将来咱们还要在那儿举行仪式哩。那个地方举行仪式最好不过了。”

“啥仪式？”

“我也说不上。反正强盗老举行仪式，咱们当然也要举行。走吧，哈克，咱俩在这里待得太久了。我看时候不早了。我也饿了。上了船咱俩就吃点东西，抽会儿烟。”

不久，两个人钻进了漆树丛，谨慎地四出张望，见河岸没人，便上了船，吃起东西，抽起了烟。太阳已落入地平线，他俩把船推入水，往回划。薄暮中，很长一段时间里，汤姆慢慢地划着桨，高高兴兴与哈克聊着天，天暗不久上了岸。

“我说，哈克，”汤姆说，“咱俩把钱藏在寡妇家木棚的阁楼里，明早我来，先点个数，再两人平分掉。然后在林子里找个安全的地方埋起来。这会儿你悄悄待在这儿看管好东西。我去把本尼·泰勒的小车推来。我去去不会很久的。”

汤姆走了，很快就推着车回来了。他俩把两小口袋东西装上车，用破布盖上，拉着车走了。两个孩子经过威尔士人家门时，停下来歇息。就在他俩准备起身，那威尔士人走了出来，赶上几步，问：

“喂，谁呀？”

“哈克和汤姆·索亚。”

“正好！跟我来，孩子，大伙正等着你俩呢。我说，麻利点——往前走。车我来拉。车还不轻哩。装的是砖还是金属？”

“是些废金属。”汤姆说。

“我看也是。镇子里的孩子，就不怕惹麻烦，花那么多的时间拾废铜烂铁卖给铸造厂，挣几个小钱，就是不愿干正经活，挣双倍的工钱。不过这也是人的天性。快——快走。”

两个孩子想知道，这么急急忙忙催着到底为哪般。

“别忙。到了道格拉斯寡妇家就知道了。”

哈克有几分害怕，因为他老是被无缘无故怪罪。

“琼斯先生，我们可没做啥错事。”

威尔士人笑了起来。

“我也不知情，哈克，我的孩子。我也不知道为了啥。你跟那寡妇是好朋友？”

“是呀。反正她一向对我很好。”

“那好。那你有什么好害怕的？”

哈克的脑子一时反应不过来，没有作出回答，便和汤姆一起被推进了道格拉斯太太的客厅里。琼斯先生把车留在门口，跟了进来。

客厅里灯火通明，村子里有脸面的人几乎都来了。撒切尔夫妇也在。此外还有哈珀夫妇、罗杰斯夫妇、波莉姨妈、锡德、玛丽，牧师、报纸的编辑等等许多人。大家都穿上最好的衣服。寡妇接待起这副模样的两个孩子来，那热情劲恐怕是无人能及了。你看他俩满身的污泥和蜡烛油，羞得波莉姨妈满面通红，冲着汤姆又是皱眉，又是摇头。两个孩子受的那份罪，在场的人没一个及得他俩的一半。可琼斯先生说：

“刚才汤姆不在家，我没等下去。后来正好在我家门口撞上了他和哈克，便赶紧催着他俩过来了。”

“你做得对。”寡妇说，“跟我来，孩子。”

她领着他俩进了卧室，说：

“先洗洗，换身衣服。这儿有两套新衣服——衬衣、袜子，全都有。这一套是哈克的。不，别谢了，哈克——琼斯先生买来一套，另一套是我置办的。两套你俩全适合。快穿上。我们等着。穿戴好了就下楼来。”

她说罢便走了。





第三十四章


哈克说：“汤姆，要是能找到一根绳子，咱俩就偷偷溜走。窗子离地面不高。”

“废话，干吗要溜走？”

“得了，那么一大帮子的人我可受不了。我可不下楼去，汤姆。”

“哦，讨厌！没啥。我毫不在乎。我会照应你的。”

锡德来了。

“汤姆，”他说，“姨妈等了你整整一个下午。玛丽已把你上主日学校的衣服准备好了。大家一直都为你操心来着。你说，你满身沾的可是烛油和泥巴？”

“我说，锡德先生，你管好自己的事得了。摆出这么大的场面到底为了啥？”

“这是寡妇家的一次聚会，她家老开这样的聚会。这次是专为威尔士人和他两个儿子开的，感谢他们那天晚上帮她脱了险。呃，要是你想听，我可以告诉你几件事。”

“好吧，你说。”

“今晚琼斯老先生准备当着大家的面说件事。这可是件秘密，今儿他跟姨妈说时我偷听到了。我估计，这事这会儿已不是秘密了。谁都知道了。寡妇也不例外，可她竭力装得什么也不知道。琼斯先生非要请哈克到这儿不可——要是缺了哈克，他是说不了自己那天大的秘密的。”

“什么秘密，锡德？”

“说的是哈克跟踪那几个强盗到寡妇家的事儿。我估计琼斯先生想要给大家一个大惊喜，我敢打赌，到头来他会大失所望的。”

锡德咯咯地笑了起来，瞧他那得意劲。

“锡德，这话是你说的？”

“别问是哪个说的。反正有人说过——这就结了。”

“锡德，咱们这个镇，只有一个人缺德到家，他才干得出来，那人就是你。那天换了你，遇到哈克那样的情形，准会溜号，不会向别人端出强盗的事来。你除了缺德的事，什么也不会干，见到人家做了好事、受到夸奖，你就受不了。瞧好了——按寡妇的说法：‘别谢了！’”汤姆说着，给了锡德一耳光，连踢几脚，把他赶出了门，“你有种，就向姨妈告我的状吧，明天有你好瞧的！”

几分钟后，寡妇的一班客人都在餐桌前坐了下来。按当时当地的风俗，十几个孩子也被安排在同一房间的小边桌前。良辰一到，琼斯先生简短致辞，感谢寡妇为他和他的两个儿子举行了这个聚会，但是，他说，另外还有一个人，他的谦恭——

等等，等等。他拿出自己最擅长的、最具戏剧效果的手段，滔滔不绝说起了有关那次惊险历程中哈克的表现。但是在场的人听了他这番话后所表现出来的惊讶，多半是装出来的，缺了在更加热闹的场合下所显露出来的那种激情和喧闹。不过，寡妇还是表现出极大的惊讶，对哈克大加夸奖，感激不已。哈克呢，他身穿新衣，又成了众目关注的中心和赞扬的对象，害得他不知所措，难以忍受，而寡妇的这番话倒让他忘了浑身的不自在了。

寡妇说她想让哈克有个家，供他上学，等到自己有足够的钱，帮他做点小生意。汤姆觉得机会来了，便说：

“哈克不需要钱。他有的是钱！”

要不是这些客人举止文雅，使劲克制着，听了这番天大的玩笑话，准会爆发出理所当然的、表示赞许的哄堂大笑来。但是谁也没有作声，场面有点尴尬，好在汤姆说话了：

“哈克有钱了。你们也许不相信。他有了很多很多的钱。哦，你们用不着发笑。我想我可以拿给你们瞧瞧。等会儿就是了。”

汤姆跑到门外，在座的人又惊又疑，个个面面相觑，随着用探究的目光打量哈克，害得他只有瞠目结舌的份儿。

“锡德，汤姆犯什么病了？”波莉姨妈说，“他——唉，这孩子的心思老叫人摸不透。我从来就没——”

汤姆进来时拖着两只沉甸甸的袋子，打断了波莉姨妈的话语。汤姆把黄灿灿的钱币往桌子上倒，说：

“瞧——我说什么来着？一半是哈克的，一半是我的！”

面对这景象，个个都喘不过气来，只是一声不吭，大眼瞪小眼。可过了一会儿大家都异口同声要求他说说到底是怎么回事。汤姆说他能满足他们的要求，便说了起来。这故事挺长挺长，听得人兴趣盎然。这故事魅力无穷，叙述过程中没人插嘴。汤姆说完了，琼斯先生说：

“我原想在今天这种场面说一件秘密，让大家惊喜惊喜，现在看来，那秘密压根不值一提。我真心承认，跟这事相比，我那秘密微不足道。”

数了数钱数。总共有一万两千多元。在场的人以前谁也没见过这么多的钱，不过论财产，其中有几家人还不只这个数。





第三十五章


汤姆和哈克发了大财，在圣彼得斯堡这个贫穷的小村引起极大的轰动，至此读者诸君该感到满足了吧。钱数之多，全是现钱，简直令人难以置信。人人争相议论，有赞叹的，有妒忌的，纷纷扰扰，闹得许多村民在不健康的情绪刺激下，丧失了理智。圣彼得斯堡和邻近村子的“闹鬼的房子”被拆得一间不剩，木板被一一翻过，地基被掘地三尺，全是为寻找埋葬的财宝。干这种事的不但有男孩子，其中不乏成年人——一些非常庄重、从不作非分之想的成年人。汤姆和哈克所到之处，人们无不对他俩殷勤有加，羡慕不已，热情相视。两个孩子记不得以前他们说的话有多少分量，如今他俩的话语都被奉为至理名言，再三被人引用。他们的一举一动都引人注目；他们似乎已丧失说寻常话、做寻常事的能力。更有甚者，他们过去的一言一行全被挖掘出来，收集起来，从中发现了许多迹象，表明他俩早年便有与众不同之处。村里的报纸还刊登了这两名孩子的小传。

寡妇道格拉斯把哈克的钱按六厘的利息放了债。撒切尔法官在波莉姨妈要求下，以同样的方式处理了汤姆的钱。现在这两个孩子都有了收入，不小的收入——一年中每个工作日都有一元的进项，星期天则减半。这恰恰与牧师的薪俸相当——不过这只是人家允诺付给牧师的钱，实际上他还拿不到这个数。当年人过的是勤俭节约的日子，一周的食宿和上学的花销只一元二角五分就够了——还能提供衣着和梳洗的费用。

撒切尔法官非常器重汤姆。他说，寻常的孩子无法帮他女儿从山洞里脱险。贝基私底下告诉父亲说起在学校里汤姆替她挨鞭子的事，法官的感动之情溢于言表。当她说到汤姆为了她不挨鞭子而撒了个大谎，请求父亲原谅汤姆，法官大动感情，说，这可是个高尚的、慷慨的、宽宏大度的谎言——一句足以昂首挺胸步入史册的谎言，一句足与乔治·华盛顿广受赞誉的有关小斧头的实话18媲美的谎言！当贝基看到父亲脚踩地板，跺着双脚，说了这番话，顿时觉得父亲从未有过如此高大，如此威武。她连忙跑去把这一切告诉了汤姆。

撒切尔法官指望汤姆有朝一日成为大律师或大军事家。他说他有意让汤姆进入国立军事院校，然后在全国顶尖的法学院接受教育，以便将来从事其中的一种或同时从事这两种职业。

哈克·费恩有了这么一大笔财富，又受到寡妇道格拉斯的呵护，他自然被引入了社交圈——不，他是被拖进了、被扔进社交圈的——他所受的罪令他难以忍受。寡妇家的仆人把他擦洗得干干净净、齐齐整整，又是给他梳头，又是替他刷衣，晚上让他睡在无情无义的被单上，上面居然找不到一星半点的污渍，过去污渍都被他当好朋友，紧贴心头；吃饭时得用刀叉，要围上餐巾，使用杯盘碗盏；要他学习课本，不得不上教堂，讲话不得不文绉绉的，干巴巴的，味同嚼蜡；不管，他身在何处，他的手脚无不受到文明牢笼和枷锁的禁锢和束缚。

他勇敢地受了三个星期的罪，有一天终于失踪了。寡妇悲痛欲绝，四处寻找，足足找了四十八小时。公众也非常关心，把远远近近、角角落落寻了个遍，还到河里去捞他的尸体。第三天一早，汤姆·索亚灵机一动，猛想起到那废弃的屠宰场后面，在那几只旧空桶里去搜寻，果然在一只桶中找到这位出逃者。哈克正睡在桶里。早饭他吃的是偷来的一些残羹冷饭。这时他正叼着烟斗舒舒服服地躺着。他蓬头乱发、肮里肮脏，又披上当年逍遥自在的日子里那一身标志性的破衣烂衫。汤姆催着他起来，告诉他闯了大祸了，要他赶快回家。哈克脸上那种悠闲自在的神情顿时消失，变成了一副愁眉苦脸的样子。他说：

“别说了，汤姆。我试过，可没用。没用，汤姆。那种日子不适合我，我不习惯。那寡妇对我好，把我当成了朋友。可我受不了那种生活。每天一大早她逼我起床，逼我洗脸，把头发梳得光溜溜的，不让我睡在木棚里，让我穿上那些喘不过气来的该死衣服，汤姆。那些衣服密密实实，一丝风也透不进来，还讲究得不行，害得人坐也不是，躺也不是，更不用说在哪儿打滚了。我压根没进过地窖——像是好多年没进了。我得上教堂，去受罪，受不完的罪。那些布道词烦死人了！我不能在那儿捕苍蝇，不能嚼烟草。星期天整天得穿上鞋子。寡妇家吃饭摇铃，睡觉摇铃，起床还摇铃——干什么事都得按规矩，我可受不了。”

“得了，哈克，人人都这样。”

“汤姆，这不相干。我不是他们。我受不了。把人管得死死的，太难受了。饭来张口的日子我不喜欢——我不感兴趣。想钓鱼得问人家，要游泳也得问人家。干什么事都得问人家。得了，说话还得文绉绉的，多别扭——我只好每天爬到阁楼里，乱骂一气，嘴里才舒服，再这么下去我非死不可，汤姆。那寡妇不让我抽烟，不让我大声说话，不许人前打呵欠、伸懒腰、抓痒痒。”说到这里，他显得特别生气，像是受了委屈的样子，“真是活见鬼，她成天祷告个不停！从未见过这样的女人！我只好开溜，汤姆，只得这么做。再说，快要开学了，我得去上学。得了，我可受不了，汤姆。你瞧，汤姆，做个有钱人还真的不像人家说的那么好。受不完的担惊受怕，遭的罪可不轻哩。倒不如死了的好。还是这些衣服适合我穿，这空桶睡起来舒服，我再也离不开它们了。汤姆，要不是我有了这钱，就不会惹上这些麻烦了。你这就把我的那一份钱拿走吧，有时给我一两毛钱得了——别经常给，因为除非是非常难到手的东西，我是不会轻易花一分钱的。你替我去向寡妇求求情吧。”

“哦，哈克，我办不到。这不公平。再说只要多过几天这样的日子，时间一长，你就会喜欢上的。”

“喜欢！不是吗，就像是在热炉子上坐久了，就离不开它了。我说，汤姆，我不要做有钱人，我不喜欢待在那些该死的让人透不过气来的房子里。我喜欢树林子，喜欢河流，喜欢大桶，我离不了它们。天杀的！枪呀，山洞呀，这些做强盗必不可少的东西咱们全有了，可偏生出这档子蠢事，全被搅黄了。”

汤姆见来了机会，便说：

“听我说，哈克，有了钱并不妨碍我去做强盗。”

“好哇！太好了。你这是说的真话，汤姆？”

“当然是真话，就像你眼前的我，假得了？知道吗，可要是你做人不让人尊重，我就不让你入伙。”

哈克的高兴劲儿消失了。

“不让我入伙，汤姆？你以前不是让我入伙做过海盗吗？”

“不，那是两码事。强盗比海盗档次要高——这是常理。在大多数国家，强盗都属于高档次的贵族——公爵一类的人。”

“我说汤姆，你一向不是把我看作是朋友吗？你不会把我挡在门外吧，汤姆？你不会这样干的，是不是，汤姆？”

“哈克，我不想那样做，也不愿那样做，可人家会怎么说呢？他们会说：哼，好个汤姆·索亚帮！里面混进这么个孬种！他们说的是你，哈克。这话，你不爱听，我也不爱听。”

哈克沉默了一会儿，他思前想后了一阵后，说：

“得了，只要让我入你的帮，我便回寡妇家，将就过它一个月，看受不受得下去。”

“好，哈克，好样的！跟我走，老伙计。让我请寡妇不要对你管得太紧，哈克。”

“是吗，汤姆，你会这么做吗？太棒了。只要她在最厉害的那些规矩中放松点，我背地里能抽口烟，躲起来说几句脏话，我便使劲熬下去，拼着命熬着。你们准备什么时候成立那个帮，当上强盗？”

“好哩，说干就干。说不定今晚就把那几个孩子召集一起，举行仪式。”

“举行什么仪式？”

“入帮仪式。”

“到底什么样的？”

“要发誓大伙互相帮衬，永不泄密，就是被剁成肉酱，也不吐一个字。谁要是伤害帮里的弟兄，便杀了他和全家。”

“好玩，真叫好玩，汤姆。”

“可不是，是好玩。所有的起誓仪式都要在半夜三更举行，尽量在最最偏僻、最最恐怖的地方举行——最好在闹鬼的房子里，可那些房子都给拆得一干二净了。”

“反正半夜三更这么干挺棒的，汤姆。”

“可不是，是挺棒。还得在棺材上起誓，名字还得用血来签。”

“哦，还挺像回事哩！这可比当海盗棒千万倍了。我到死也跟定寡妇了，汤姆。要是我真的当上了响当当的强盗，人人都在议论我，我看，到了那时她准为自己能把我从火坑里捞出来而自豪的。”





尾声


本故事就此结束。严格地说，这个故事说的是一个儿童的故事，该由此搁笔了，再写下去不就成了大人故事了吗？写成人小说的人都知道该在哪里结束——就是说，写到结婚为止。可要是写的是少年故事，那就得适可而止。

本书的大多数人物现在仍活着，活得舒心而快活。也许有一天继续提笔写写这些年轻人的故事，看看他们（她们）到底会成为什么样的人物，倒不失为件有意义的事。所以，最明智的做法是，他们这一阶段的生活现在还是不披露的好。





PREFACE


Most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred；one or two were experiences of my own,the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine.Huck Finn is drawn from life；Tom Sawyer also,but not from an individual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew,and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.

The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say,thirty or forty years ago.

Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls,I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account,for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves,and of how they felt and thought and talked,and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.

HARTFORD，1876





CHAPTER Ⅰ


“TOM！”

No answer.

“TOM！”

No answer.

“What's gone with that boy,I wonder?You TOM！”

No answer.

The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room；then she put them up and looked out under them.She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy；they were her state pair,the pride of her heart,and were built for“style，”not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove lids just as well.She looked perplexed for a moment,and then said,not fiercely,but still loud enough for the furniture to hear：

“Well,I lay if I get hold of you I'll—”

She did not finish,for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom,and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with.She resurrected nothing but the cat.

“I never did see the beat of that boy！”

She went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and“jimpson”weeds that constituted the garden.No Tom.So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted：

“Y-o-u-u Tom！”

There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.

“There！I might'a'thought of that closet.What you been doing in there?”

“Nothing.”

“Nothing！Look at your hands.And look at your mouth.What is that truck?”

“I don't know,aunt.”

“Well,I know.It's jam—that's what it is.Forty times I've said if you didn't let that jam alone I'd skin you.Hand me that switch.”

The switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—

“My！Look behind you,aunt！”

The old lady whirled round,and snatched her skirts out of danger.The lad fled,on the instant,scrambled up the high board fence,and disappeared over it.

His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment,and then broke into a gentle laugh.

“Hang the boy,can't I never learn anything?Ain't he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time?But old fools is the biggest fools there is.Can't learn an old dog new tricks,as the saying is.But my goodness,he never plays them alike,two days,and how is a body to know what's coming?He'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up,and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh,it's all down again and I can't hit him a lick.I ain't doing my duty by that boy,and that's the Lord's truth,goodness knows.Spare the rod and spile the child,as the Good Book says.I'm a-laying up sin and suffering for us both,I know.He's full of the Old Scratch,but laws-a-me！he's my own dead sister's boy,poor thing,and I ain't got the heart to lash him,somehow.Every time I let him off,my conscience does hurt me so,and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks.Well-a-well,man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble,as the Scripture says,and I reckon it's so.He'll play hooky this evening，19and I'll just be obleeged to make him work,tomorrow,to punish him.It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays,when all the boys is having holiday,but he hates work more than he hates anything else,and I've got to do some of my duty by him,or I'll be the ruination of the child.”

Tom did play hooky,and he had a very good time.He got back home barely in season to help Jim,the small colored boy,saw next day's wood and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work.Tom's younger brother（or rather half brother）Sid was already through with his part of the work（picking up chips），for he was a quiet boy,and had no adventurous,troublesome ways.

While Tom was eating his supper,and stealing sugar as opportunity offered,Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile,and very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments.Like many other simple-hearted souls,it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy,and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning.Said she：

“Tom,it was middling warm in school,warn't it?”

“Yes'm.”

“Powerful warm,warn't it?”

“Yes'm.”

“Didn't you want to go in a-swimming,Tom?”

A bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.He searched Aunt Polly's face,but it told him nothing.So he said：

“No'm—well,not very much.”

The old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom's shirt,and said：

“But you ain't too warm now,though.”And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind.But in spite of her,Tom knew where the wind lay,now.So he forestalled what might be the next move：

“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine's damp yet.See?”

Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence,and missed a trick.Then she had a new inspiration：

“Tom,you didn't have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it,to pump on your head,did you?Unbutton your jacket！”

The trouble vanished out of Tom's face.He opened his jacket.His shirt collar was securely sewed.

“Bother！Well,go'long with you.I'd made sure you'd played hooky and been a-swimming.But I forgive ye,Tom.I reckon you're a kind of a singed cat,as the saying is—better'n you look.This time.”

She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried,and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.

But Sidney said：

“Well,now,if I didn't think you sewed his collar with white thread,but it's black.”

“Why,I did sew it with white！Tom！”

But Tom did not wait for the rest.As he went out at the door he said：

“Siddy,I'll lick you for that.”

In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket,and had thread bound about them—one needle carried white thread and the other black.He said：

“She'd never noticed if it hadn't been for Sid.Confound it！sometimes she sews it with white,and sometimes she sews it with black.I wish to geeminy she'd stick to one or t'other—I can't keep the run of'em.But I bet you I'll lam Sid for that.I'll learn him！”

He was not the Model Boy of the village.He knew the model boy very well though—and loathed him.

Within two minutes,or even less,he had forgotten all his troubles.Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man,but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises.This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling,which he had just acquired from a Negro,and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed.It consisted in a peculiar birdlike turn,a sort of liquid warble,produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to do it,if he has ever been a boy.Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it,and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude.He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt,as far as strong,deep,unalloyed pleasure is concerned,the advantage was with the boy,not the astronomer.

The summer evenings were long.It was not dark,yet.Presently Tom checked his whistle.A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger than himself.A newcomer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St.Petersburg.This boy was well dressed,too—well dressed on a weekday.This was simply astounding.His cap was a dainty thing,his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty,and so were his pantaloons.He had shoes on—and it was only Friday.He even wore a necktie,a bright bit of ribbon.He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals.The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel,the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow.Neither boy spoke.If one moved,the other moved—but only sidewise,in a circle；they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time.Finally Tom said：

“I can lick you！”

“I'd like to see you try it.”

“Well,I can do it.”

“No you can't,either.”

“Yes I can.”

“No you can't.”

“I can.”

“You can't.”

“Can！”

“Can't！”

An uncomfortable pause.Then Tom said：

“What's your name?”

“'Tisn't any of your business,maybe.”

“Well I'low I'll make it my business.”

“Well why don't you?”

“If you say much,I will.”

“Much—much—much.There now.”

“Oh,you think you're mighty smart,don't you?I could lick you with one hand tied behind me,if I wanted to.”

“Well why don't you do it?You say you can do it.”

“Well I will,if you fool with me.”

“Oh yes—I've seen whole families in the same fix.”

“Smarty！You think you're some,now,don't you?Oh,what a hat！”

“You can lump that hat if you don't like it.I dare you to knock it off—and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs.”

“You're a liar！”

“You're another.”

“You're a fighting liar and dasn't take it up.”

“Aw—take a walk！”

“Say—if you give me much more of your sass I'll take and bounce a rock off'n your head.”

“Oh,of course you will.”

“Well I will.”

“Well why don't you do it then?What do you keep saying you will for?Why don't you do it?It's because you're afraid.”

“I ain't afraid.”

“You are.”

“I ain't.”

“You are.”

Another pause,and more eyeing and sidling around each other.Presently they were shoulder to shoulder.Tom said：

“Get away from here！”

“Go away yourself！”

“I won't.”

“I won't either.”

So they stood,each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace,and both shoving with might and main,and glowering at each other with hate.But neither could get an advantage.After struggling till both were hot and flushed,each relaxed his strain with watchful caution,and Tom said：

“You're a coward and a pup.I'll tell my big brother on you,and he can thrash you with his little finger,and I'll make him do it,too.”

“What do I care for your big brother?I've got a brother that's bigger than he is—and what's more,he can throw him over that fence,too.”（Both brothers were imaginary.）

“That's a lie.”

“Your saying so don't make it so.”

Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe,and said：

“I dare you to step over that,and I'll lick you till you can't stand up.Anybody that'll take a dare will steal sheep.”

The new boy stepped over promptly,and said：

“Now you said you'd do it,now let's see you do it.”

“Don't you crowd me now；you better look out.”

“Well,you said you'd do it—why don't you do it?”

“By jingo！for two cents I will do it.”

The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision.Tom struck them to the ground.In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt,gripped together like cats；and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes,punched and scratched each other's nose,and covered themselves with dust and glory.Presently the confusion took form,and through the fog of battle Tom appeared,seated astride the new boy,and pounding him with his fists.

“Holler'nuff！”said he.

The boy only struggled to free himself.He was crying—mainly from rage.

“Holler'nuff！”—and the pounding went on.

At last the stranger let out a smothered“'Nuff！”and Tom let him up and said：

“Now that'll learn you.Better look out who you're fooling with next time.”

The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes,sobbing,snuffling,and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to Tom the“next time he caught him out.”To which Tom responded with jeers,and started off in high feather,and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone,threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope.Tom chased the traitor home,and thus found out where he lived.He then held a position at the gate for some time,daring the enemy to come outside,but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined.At last the enemy's mother appeared,and called Tom a bad,vicious,vulgar child,and ordered him away.So he went away；but he said he“'lowed”to“lay”for that boy.

He got home pretty late,that night,and when he climbed cautiously in at the window,he uncovered an ambuscade,in the person of his aunt；and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness.





CHAPTER Ⅱ


Saturday morning was come,and all the summer world was bright and fresh,and brimming with life.There was a soⅡng in every heart；and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips.There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step.The locust trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air.Cardiff Hill,beyond the village and above it,was green with vegetation,and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land,dreamy,reposeful,and inviting.

Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long-handled brush.He surveyed the fence,and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit.Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high.Life to him seemed hollow,and existence but a burden.Sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank；repeated the operation；did it again；compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far-reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence,and sat down on a tree-box discouraged.Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail,and singing“Buffalo Gals”.Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes,before,but now it did not strike him so.He remembered that there was company at the pump.White,mulatto,and Negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns,resting,trading playthings,quarrelling,fighting,skylarking.And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off,Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour—and even then somebody generally had to go after him.Tom said：

“Say,Jim,I'll fetch the water if you'll whitewash some.”

Jim shook his head and said：

“Can't,Mars Tom.Ole missis,she tole me I got to go an'git dis water an'not stop foolin'roun'wid anybody.She say she spec'mars Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash,an'so she tole me go'long an’'tend to my own business—she'lowed she'd'tend to de whitewashin’.”

“Oh,never mind what she said,Jim.That's the way she always talks.Gimme the bucket—I won't be gone only a a minute.She won't ever know.”

“Oh,I dasn't,Mars Tom.Ole missis she'd take an'tar de head off'n me.'Deed she would.”

“She！She never licks anybody—whacks'em over the head with her thimble—and who cares for that,I'd like to know.She talks awful,but talk don't hurt—anyways it don't if she don't cry.Jim,I'll give you a marvel.I'll give you a white alley！”

Jim began to waver.

“White alley,Jim！And it's a bully taw.”

“My！Dat's a mighty gay marvel,I tell you！But Mars Tom I's powerful'fraid ole missis—”

“And besides,if you will I'll show you my sore toe.”

Jim was only human—this attraction was too much for him.He put down his pail,took the white alley,and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound.In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear,Tom was whitewashing with vigor,and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.

But Tom's energy did not last.He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day,and his sorrows multiplied.Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions,and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work—the very thought of it burnt him like fire.He got out his worldly wealth and examined it—bits of toys,marbles,and trash；enough to buy an exchange of work,maybe,but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom.So he returned his straitened means to his pocket,and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys.At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him！Nothing less than a great,magnificent inspiration.

He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work.Ben Rogers hove in sight presently—the very boy,of all boys,whose ridicule he had been dreading.Ben's gait was the hop-skip-and-jump—proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high.He was eating an apple,and giving a long,melodious whoop,at intervals,followed by a deep-toned ding-dong-dong,ding-dong-dong,for he was personating a steamboat.As he drew near,he slackened speed,took the middle of the street,leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance—for he was personating the Big Missouri,and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water.He was boat and captain and engine bells combined,so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane deck giving the orders and executing them：

“Stop her,sir！Ting-a-ling-ling！”The headway ran almost out,and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk.

“Ship up to back！Ting-a-ling-ling！”His arms straightened and stiffened down his sides.

“Set her back on the stabboard！Ting-a-ling-ling！Chow！ch-chow-wow！Chow！”His right hand,meantime,describing stately circles,for it was representing a forty-foot wheel.

“Let her go back on the labboard！Ting-a-ling-ling！Chow-ch-chow-chow！”The left hand began to describe circles.

“Stop the stabboard！Ting-a-ling-ling！Stop the labboard！Come ahead on the stabboard！Stop her！Let your outside turn over slow！Ting-a-ling-ling！Chow-ow-ow！Get out that head-line！Lively now！Come—out with your spring-line—what're you about there！Take a turn round that stump with the bight of it！Stand by that stage,now—let her go！Done with the engines,sir！Ting-a-ling-ling！Sh't！S'h't！Sh't！”（trying the gauge cocks）.

Tom went on whitewashing—paid no attention to the steamboat.Ben stared a moment and then said：

“Hi-yi！You're up a stump,ain't you！”

No answer.Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist,then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result,as before.Ben ranged up alongside of him.Tom's mouth watered for the apple,but he stuck to his work.Ben said：

“Hello,old chap,you got to work,hey?”

Tom wheeled suddenly and said：

“Why,it's you,Ben！I warn't noticing.”

“Say—I'm going in a-swimming,I am.Don't you wish you could?But of course you'd druther work—wouldn't you?Course you would！”

Tom contemplated the boy a bit,and said：

“What do you call work?”

“Why,ain't that work?”

Tom resumed his whitewashing,and answered carelessly：

“Well,maybe it is,and maybe it ain't.All I know,is,it suits Tom Sawyer.”

“Oh come,now,you don't mean to let on that you like it?”

The brush continued to move.

“Like it?Well,I don't see why I oughtn't to like it.Does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day?”

That put the thing in a new light.Ben stopped nibbling his apple.Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth—stepped back to note the effect—added a touch here and there—criticized the effect again—Ben watching every move and getting more and more interested,more and more absorbed.Presently he said：

“Say,Tom,let me whitewash a little.”

Tom considered,was about to consent；but he altered his mind：

“No—no—I reckon it wouldn't hardly do,Ben.You see,Aunt Polly's awful particular about this fence—right here on the street,you know—but if it was the back fence I wouldn't mind and she wouldn't.Yes,she's awful particular about this fence；it's got to be done very careful；I reckon there ain't one boy in a thousand,maybe two thousand,that can do it the way it's got to be done.”

“No—is that so?Oh come,now—lemme just try.Only just a little—I'd let you,if you was me,Tom.”

“Ben,I'd like to,honest injun；but Aunt Polly—well,Jim wanted to do it,but she wouldn't let him；Sid wanted to do it,and she wouldn't let Sid.Now don't you see how I'm fixed?If you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it—”

“Oh,shucks,I'll be just as careful.Now lemme try.Say—I'll give you the core of my apple.”

“Well,here—No,Ben,now don't.I'm afeard—”

“I'll give you all of it！”

Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face,but alacrity in his heart.And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun,the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by,dangled his legs,munched his apple,and planned the slaughter of more innocents.There was no lack of material；boys happened along every little while；they came to jeer,but remained to whitewash.By the time Ben was fagged out,Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite,in good repair；and when he played out,Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on,and so on,hour after hour.And when the middle of the afternoon came,from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning,Tom was literally rolling in wealth.He had besides the things before mentioned,twelve marbles,part of a jew's-harp,a piece of blue bottle glass to look through,a spool cannon,a key that wouldn't unlock anything,a fragment of chalk,a glass stopper of a decanter,a tin soldier,a couple of tadpoles,six firecrackers,a kitten with only one eye,a brass doorknob,a dog collar—but no dog—the handle of a knife,four pieces of orange peel,and a dilapidated old window sash.

He had had a nice,good,idle time all the while—plenty of company—and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it！If he hadn't run out of whitewash,he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.

Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world,after all.He had discovered a great law of human action,without knowing it—namely,that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing,it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.If he had been a great and wise philosopher,like the writer of this book,he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do,and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do.And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a treadmill is work,while rolling tenpins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement.There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line,in the summer,because the privilege costs them considerable money；but if they were offered wages for the service,that would turn it into work and then they would resign.

The boy mused a while over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances,and then wended toward headquarters to report.





CHAPTER Ⅲ


Tom presented himself before Aunt Polly,who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment,which was bedroom,breakfast room,dining room,and library,combined.The balmy summer air,the restful quiet,the odor of the flowers,and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect,and she was nodding over her knitting—for she had no company but the cat,and it was asleep in her lap.Her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety.She had thought that of course Tom had deserted long ago,and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way.He said：“Mayn't I go and play now,aunt?”

“What,a'ready?How much have you done?”

“It's all done,aunt.”

“Tom,don't lie to me—I can't bear it.”

“I ain't,aunt；it is all done.”

Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence.She went out to see for herself；and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of Tom's statement true.When she found the entire fence whitewashed,and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated,and even a streak added to the ground,her astonishment was almost unspeakable.She said：

“Well,I never！There's no getting round it,you can work when you're a mind to,Tom.”And then she diluted the compliment by adding，“But it's powerful seldom you're a mind to,I'm bound to say.Well,go'long and play；but mind you get back some time in a week,or I'll tan you.”

She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him,along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish,he“hooked”a doughnut.

Then he skipped out,and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor.Clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling.They raged around Sid like a hailstorm；and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue,six or seven clods had taken personal effect,and Tom was over the fence and gone.There was a gate,but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it.His soul was at peace,now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble.

Tom skirted the block,and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt's cow stable.He presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment,and hastened toward the public square of the village,where two“military”companies of boys had met for conflict,according to previous appointment.Tom was General of one of these armies,Joe Harper（a bosom friend）General of the other.These two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person—that being better suited to the still smaller fry—but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides-de-camp.Tom's army won a great victory,after a long and hard-fought battle.Then the dead were counted,prisoners exchanged,the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon,and the day for the necessary battle appointed；after which the armies fell into line and marched away,and Tom turned homeward alone.

As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived,he saw a new girl in the garden—a lovely little blue-eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long tails,white summer frock and embroidered pan-talettes.The fresh-crowned hero fell without firing a shot.A certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind.He had thought he loved her to distraction,he had regarded his passion as adoration；and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality.He had been months winning her；she had confessed hardly a week ago；he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days,and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done.

He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye,till he saw that she had discovered him；then he pretended he did not know she was present,and began to“show off”in all sorts of absurd boyish ways,in order to win her admiration.He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time；but by and by,while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances,he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house.Tom came up to the fence and leaned on it,grieving,and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door.Tom heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold.But his face lit up,right away,for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared.

The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower,and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose,with his head tilted far back；and as he moved from side to side,in his efforts,he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy；finally his bare foot rested upon it,his pliant toes closed upon it,and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner.But only for a minute—only while he could button the flower inside his jacket,next his heart—or next his stomach,possibly,for he was not much posted in anatomy,and not hypercritical,anyway.

He returned,now,and hung about the fence till nightfall，“showing off，”as before,but the girl never exhibited herself again,though Tom comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window,meantime,and been aware of his attentions.Finally he strode home reluctantly,with his poor head full of visions.

All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered“what had got into the child.”He took a good scolding about clodding Sid,and did not seem to mind it in the least.He tried to steal sugar under his aunt's very nose,and got his knuckles rapped for it.He said：

“Aunt,you don't whack Sid when he takes it.”

“Well,Sid don't torment a body the way you do.You'd be always into that sugar if I warn't watching you.”

Presently she stepped into the kitchen,and Sid,happy in his immunity,reached for the sugar bowl—a sort of glorying over Tom which was well-nigh unbearable.But Sid's fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke.Tom was in ecstasies.In such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent.He said to himself that he would not speak a word,even when his aunt came in,but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief；and then he would tell,and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model“catch it”.He was so brim full of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles.He said to himself，“Now it's coming！”And the next instant he was sprawling on the floor！The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom cried out：

“Hold on,now,what'er you belting me for?—Sid broke it！”

Aunt Polly paused,perplexed,and Tom looked for healing pity.But when she got her tongue again,she only said：

“Umf！Well,you didn't get a lick amiss,I reckon.You been into some other audacious mischief when I wasn't around,like enough.”

Then her conscience reproached her,and she yearned to say something kind and loving；but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong,and discipline forbade that.So she kept silence,and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes.He knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him,and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it.He would hang out no signals,he would take notice of none.He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him,now and then,through a film of tears,but he refused recognition of it.He pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word,but he would turn his face to the wall,and die with that word unsaid.Ah,how would she feel then?And he pictured himself brought home from the river,dead,with his curls all wet,and his sore heart at rest.How she would throw herself upon him,and how her tears would fall like rain,and her lips pray God to give her back her boy and she would never,never abuse him any more！But he would lie there cold and white and make no sign—a poor little sufferer,whose griefs were at an end.He so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams,that he had to keep swallowing,he was so like to choke；and his eyes swam in a blur of water,which overflowed when he winked,and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose.And such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows,that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it；it was too sacred for such contact；and so,presently,when his cousin Mary danced in,all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an agelong visit of one week to the country,he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other.

He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys,and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit.A log raft in the river invited him,and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream,wishing,the while,that he could only be drowned,all at once and unconsciously,without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature.Then he thought of his flower.He got it out,rumpled and wilted,and it mightily increased his dismal felicity.He wondered if she would pity him if she knew?Would she cry,and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him?Or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world?This picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights,till he wore it threadbare.At last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness.

About half past nine or ten o'clock he came along the deserted street to where the Adored Unknown lived；he paused a moment；no sound fell upon his listening ear；a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second story window.Was the sacred presence there?He climbed the fence,threaded his stealthy way through the plants,till he stood under that window；he looked up at it long,and with emotion；then he laid him down on the ground under it,disposing himself upon his back,with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower.And thus he would die—out in the cold world,with no shelter over his homeless head,no friendly hand to wipe the death-damps from his brow,no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came.And thus she would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning,and oh！would she drop one little tear upon his poor,lifeless form,would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted,so untimely cut down?

The window went up,a maidservant's discordant voice profaned the holy calm,and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr's remains！

The strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort.There was a whiz as of a missile in the air,mingled with the murmur of a curse,a sound as of shivering glass followed,and a small,vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom.

Not long after,as Tom,all undressed for bed,was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip,Sid woke up；but if he had any dim idea of making any“references to allusions，”he thought better of it and held his peace,for there was danger in Tom's eye.

Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers,and Sid made mental note of the omission.





CHAPTER Ⅳ


The sun rose upon a tranquil world,and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction.Breakfast over,Aunt Polly had family worship：it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of Scriptural quotations,welded together with a thin mortar of originality；and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the Mosaic Law,as from Sinai.

Then Tom girded up his loins,so to speak,and went to work to“get his verses.”Sid had learned his lesson days before.Tom bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses,and he chose part of the Sermon on the Mount,because he could find no verses that were shorter.At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lesson,but no more,for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought,and his hands were busy with distracting recreations.Mary took his book to hear him recite,and he tried to find his way through the fog：

“Blessed are the—a—a—”

“Poor—”

“Yes—poor；blessed are the poor—a—a—”

“In spirit—”

“In spirit；blessed are the poor in spirit,for they—they—”

“Theirs—”

“For theirs.Blessed are the poor in spirit,for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.Blessed are they that mourn,for they—they—”

“Sh—”

“For they—a—”

“S,H,A—”

“For they S,H—Oh,I don't know what it is！”

“Shall！”

“Oh,shall！for they shall—for they shall—a—a—shall mourn—a—a—blessed are they that shall—they that—a—they that shall mourn,for they shall—a—shall what?Why don't you tell me,Mary?—what do you want to be so mean for?”

“Oh,Tom,you poor thickheaded thing,I'm not teasing you.I wouldn't do that.You must go and learn it again.Don't you be discouraged,Tom,you'll manage it—and if you do,I'll give you something ever so nice.There,now,that's a good boy.”

“All right！What is it,Mary,tell me what it is.”

“Never you mind,Tom.You know if I say it's nice,it is nice.”

“You bet you that's so,Mary.All right,I'll tackle it again.”

And he did“tackle it again”—and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success.Mary gave him a brand-new“Barlow”knife worth twelve and a half cents；and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations.True,the knife would not cut anything,but it was a“sure-enough”Barlow,and there was inconceivable grandeur in that—though where the Western boys ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury,is an imposing mystery and will always remain so,perhaps.Tom contrived to scarify the cupboard with it,and was arranging to begin on the bureau,when he was called off to dress for Sunday school.

Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap,and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there；then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down；turned up his sleeves；poured out the water on the ground,gently,and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door.But Mary removed the towel and said：

“Now ain't you ashamed,Tom.You mustn't be so bad.Water won't hurt you.”

Tom was a trifle disconcerted.The basin was refilled,and this time he stood over it a little while,gathering resolution；took in a big breath and began.When he entered the kitchen presently,with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands,an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face.But when he emerged from the towel,he was not yet satisfactory,for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws,like a mask；below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck.Mary took him in hand,and when she was done with him he was a man and a brother,without distinction of color,and his saturated hair was neatly brushed,and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect.（He privately smoothed out the curls,with labor and difficulty,and plastered his hair close down to his head；for he held curls to be effeminate,and his own filled his life with bitterness.）Then Mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were simply called his“other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his wardrobe.The girl“put him to rights”after he had dressed himself；she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin,turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders,brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat.He now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable.He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked；for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him.He hoped that Mary would forget his shoes,but the hope was blighted；she coated them thoroughly with tallow,as was the custom,and brought them out.He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didn't want to do.But Mary said,persuasively：

“Please,Tom—that's a good boy.”

So he got into the shoes snarling.Mary was soon ready,and the three children set out for Sunday school—a place that Tom hated with his whole heart；but Sid and Mary were fond of it.

Sabbath-school hours were from nine to half past ten；and then church service.Two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily,and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons.The church's high-backed,uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons；the edifice was but a small,plain affair,with a sort of pine board tree-box on top of it for a steeple.At the door Tom dropped back a step and accosted a Sunday-dressed comrade：

“Say,Billy,got a yaller ticket?”

“Yes.”

“What'll you take for her?”

“What'll you give?”

“Piece of lickrish and a fishhook.”

“Less see'em.”

Tom exhibited.They were satisfactory,and the property changed hands.Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets,and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones.He waylaid other boys as they came,and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minutes longer.He entered the church,now,with a swarm of clean and noisy boys and girls,proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy.The teacher,a grave,elderly man,interfered；then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a boy's hair in the next bench,and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around；stuck a pin in another boy,presently,in order to hear him say“Ouch！”and got a new reprimand from his teacher.Tom's whole class were of a pattern—restless,noisy,and troublesome.When they came to recite their lessons,not one of them knew his verses perfectly,but had to be prompted all along.However,they worried through,and each got his reward—in small blue tickets,each with a passage of Scripture on it；each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation.Ten blue tickets equalled a red one,and could be exchanged for it；ten red tickets equalled a yellow one；for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible（worth forty cents in those easy times）to the pupil.How many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses,even for a Doré Bible?And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five.He once recited three thousand verses without stopping；but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great,and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth—a grievous misfortune for the school,for on great occasions,before company,the superintendent（as Tom expressed it）had always made this boy come out and“spread himself.”Only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible,and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance；the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar's heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks.It is possible that Tom's mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes,but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it.

In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit,with a closed hymnbook in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves,and commanded attention.When a Sunday-school superintendent makes his customary little speech,a hymnbook in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though why,is a mystery：for neither the hymnbook nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer.This superintendent was a slim creature of thirty-five,with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair；he wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead,and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required；his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a banknote,and had fringed ends；his boot toes were turned sharply up,in the fashion of the day,like sleigh-runners—an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together.Mr.Walters was very earnest of mien,and very sincere and honest at heart；and he held sacred things and places in such reverence,and so separated them from worldly matters,that unconsciously to himself his Sunday-school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week-days.He began after this fashion：

“Now,children,I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two.There—that is it.That is the way good little boys and girls should do.I see one little girl who is looking out of the window—I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere—perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds.（Applausive titter.）I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright,clean little faces assembled in a place like this,learning to do right and be good.”And so forth and so on.It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration.It was of a pattern which does not vary,and so it is familiar to us all.

The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boys,and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide,washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary.But now every sound ceased suddenly,with the subsidence of Mr.Walters'voice,and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude.

A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare—the entrance of visitors：lawyer Thatcher,accompanied by a very feeble and aged man；a fine,portly,middle-aged gentleman with iron-gray hair；and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter's wife.The lady was leading a child.Tom had been restless and full of chafings and repinings；conscience-smitten,too—he could not meet Amy Lawrence's eye,he could not brook her loving gaze.But when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment.The next moment he was“showing off”with all his might—cuffing boys,pulling hair,making faces—in a word,using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause.His exaltation had but one alloy—the memory of his humiliation in this angel's garden—and that record in sand was fast washing out,under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.

The visitors were given the highest seat of honor,and as soon as Mr.Walters'speech was finished,he introduced them to the school.The middle-aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage—no less a one than the county judge—altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon—and they wondered what kind of material he was made of—and they half wanted to hear him roar,and were half afraid he might,too.He was from Constantinople,twelve miles away—so he had travelled,and seen the world—these very eyes had looked upon the county courthouse—which was said to have a tin roof.The awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes.This was the great Judge Thatcher,brother of their own lawyer.Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward,to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school.It would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings：

“Look at him,Jim！He's a-going up there.Say—look！he's a-going to shake hands with him—he is shaking hands with him！By jings,don't you wish you was Jeff?”

Mr.Walters fell to“showing off，”with all sorts of official bustlings and activities,giving orders,delivering judgments,discharging directions here,there,everywhere that he could find a target.The librarian“showed off”—running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in.The young lady teachers“showed off”—bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed,lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones lovingly.The young gentlemen teachers“showed off”with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline—and most of the teachers,of both sexes,found business up at the library,by the pulpit；and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three times（with much seeming vexation）.The little girls“showed off”in various ways,and the little boys“showed off”with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings.And above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house,and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur—for he was“showing off，”too.

There was only one thing wanting,to make Mr.Walters'ecstasy complete,and that was a chance to deliver a Bible prize and exhibit a prodigy.Several pupils had a few yellow tickets,but none had enough—he had been around among the star pupils inquiring.He would have given worlds,now,to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.

And now at this moment,when hope was dead,Tom Sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets,nine red tickets,and ten blue ones,and demanded a Bible.This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.Walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years.But there was no getting around it—here were the certified checks,and they were good for their face.Tom was therefore elevated to a place with the Judge and the other elect,and the great news was announced from headquarters.It was the most stunning surprise of the decade,and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one's altitude,and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one.The boys were all eaten up with envy—but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges.These despised themselves,as being the dupes of a wily fraud,a guileful snake in the grass.

The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances；but it lacked somewhat of the true gush,for the poor fellow's instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light,perhaps；it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises—a dozen would strain his capacity,without a doubt.

Amy Lawrence was proud and glad,and she tried to make Tom see it in her face—but he wouldn't look.She wondered；then she was just a grain troubled；next a dim suspicion came and went—came again；she watched；a furtive glance told her worlds—and then her heart broke,and she was jealous,and angry,and the tears came and she hated everybody.Tom most of all（she thought）.

Tom was introduced to the Judge；but his tongue was tied,his breath would hardly come,his heart quaked—partly because of the awful greatness of the man,but mainly because he was her parent.He would have liked to fall down and worship him,if it were in the dark.The Judge put his hand on Tom's head and called him a fine little man,and asked him what his name was.The boy stammered,gasped,and got it out：

“Tom.”

“Oh,no,not Tom—it is—”

“Thomas.”

“Ah,that's it.I thought there was more to it,maybe.That's very well.But you've another one I daresay,and you'll tell it to me,won't you?”

“Tell the gentleman your other name,Thomas，”said Walters，“and say sir.You mustn't forget your manners.”

“Thomas Sawyer—sir.”

“That's it！That's a good boy.Fine boy.Fine,manly little fellow.Two thousand verses is a great many—very,very great many.And you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them；for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world；it's what makes great men and good men；you'll be a great man and a good man yourself,some day,Thomas,and then you'll look back and say,It's all owing to the precious Sunday-school privileges of my boyhood—it's all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn—it's all owing to the good superintendent,who encouraged me,and watched over me,and gave me a beautiful Bible—a splendid elegant Bible—to keep and have it all for my own,always—it's all owing to right bringing up！That is what you will say,Thomas—and you wouldn't take any money for those two thousand verses—no indeed you wouldn't.And now you wouldn't mind telling me and this lady some of the things you've learned—no,I know you wouldn't—for we are proud of little boys that learn.Now,no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples.Won't you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed?”

Tom was tugging at a buttonhole and looking sheepish.He blushed,now,and his eyes fell.Mr.Walters'heart sank within him.He said to himself,it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question—why did the Judge ask him?Yet he felt obliged to speak up and say：

“Answer the gentleman,Thomas—don't be afraid.”

Tom still hung fire.

“Now I know you'll tell me，”said the lady.“The names of the first two disciples were—”

“David and Goliath！”

Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.





CHAPTER Ⅴ


About half past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring,and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.The Sunday-school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents,so as to be under supervision.Aunt Polly came,and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her—Tom being placed next the aisle,in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible.The crowd filed up the aisles：the aged and needy postmaster,who had seen better days；the mayor and his wife—for they had a mayor there,among other unnecessaries；the justice of the peace；the widow Douglas,fair,smart,and forty,a generous,good-hearted soul and well-to-do,her hill mansion the only palace in the town,and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St.Petersburg could boast；the bent and venerable Major and Mrs.Ward；lawyer Riverson,the new notable from a distance；next the belle of the village,followed by a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heartbreakers；then all the young clerks in town in a body—for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane heads,a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers,till the last girl had run their gantlet；and last of all came the Model Boy,Willie Mufferson,taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass.He always brought his mother to church,and was the pride of all the matrons.The boys all hated him,he was so good.And besides,he had been“thrown up to them”so much.His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind,as usual on Sundays—accidentally.Tom had no handkerchief,and he looked upon boys who had,as snobs.

The congregation being fully assembled,now,the bell rang once more,to warn laggards and stragglers,and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery.The choir always tittered and whispered all through service.There was once a church choir that was not ill-bred,but I have forgotten where it was,now.It was a great many years ago,and I can scarcely remember anything about it,but I think it was in some foreign country.

The minister gave out the hymn,and read it through with a relish,in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point,where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a springboard：

Shall I be car-ried toe the skies,on flow'ry beds of ease，

Whilst others fight to win the prize,and sail thro'blood-y seas?

He was regarded as a wonderful reader.At church“sociables”he was always called upon to read poetry；and when he was through,the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps,and“wall”their eyes,and shake their heads,as much as to say，“Words cannot express it；it is too beautiful,too beautiful for this mortal earth.”

After the hymn had been sung,the Rev.Mr.Sprague turned himself into a bulletin board,and read off“notices”of meetings and societies and things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom—a queer custom which is still kept up in America,even in cities,away here in this age of abundant newspapers.Often,the less there is to justify a traditional custom,the harder it is to get rid of it.

And now the minister prayed.A good,generous prayer it was,and went into details：it pleaded for the church,and the little children of the church；for the other churches of the village；for the village itself；for the county；for the State；for the State officers；for the United States；for the churches of the United States；for Congress；for the President；for the officers of the Government；for poor sailors,tossed by stormy seas；for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of European monarchies and Oriental despotisms；for such as have the light and the good tidings,and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal；for the heathen in the far islands of the sea；and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor,and be as seed sown in fertile ground,yielding in time a grateful harvest of good.Amen.

There was a rustling of dresses,and the standing congregation sat down.The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer,he only endured it—if he even did that much.He was restive all through it；he kept tally of the details of the prayer,unconsciously—for he was not listening,but he knew the ground of old,and the clergyman's regular route over it—and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded,his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it；he considered additions unfair,and scoundrelly.In the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together,embracing its head with its arms,and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body,and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view；scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coattails；going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe.As indeed it was；for as sorely as Tom's hands itched to grab for it they did not dare—he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on.But with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward；and the instant the“Amen”was out the fly was a prisoner of war.His aunt detected the act and made him let it go.

The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod—and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving.Tom counted the pages of the sermon；after church he always knew how many pages there had been,but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse.However,this time he was really interested for a little while.The minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world's hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them.But the pathos,the lesson,the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy；he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the onlooking nations；his face lit with the thought,and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child,if it was a tame lion.

Now he lapsed into suffering again,as the dry argument was resumed.Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out.It was a large black beetle with formidable jaws—a“pinch bug，”he called it.It was in a percussion-cap box.The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger.A natural fillip followed,the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back,and the hurt finger went into the boy's mouth.The beetle lay there working its helpless legs,unable to turn over.Tom eyed it,and longed for it；but it was safe out of his reach.Other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle,and they eyed it too.Presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along,sad at heart,lazy with the summer softness and the quiet,weary of captivity,sighing for change.He spied the beetle；the drooping tail lifted and wagged.He surveyed the prize；walked around it；smelt at it from a safe distance；walked around it again；grew bolder,and took a closer smell；then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it,just missing it；made another,and another；began to enjoy the diversion；subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws,and continued his experiments；grew weary at last,and then indifferent and absent-minded.His head nodded,and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy,who seized it.There was a sharp yelp,a flirt of the poodle's head,and the beetle fell a couple of yards away,and lit on its back once more.The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy,several faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs,and Tom was entirely happy.The dog looked foolish,and probably felt so；but there was resentment in his heart,too,and a craving for revenge.So he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again；jumping at it from every point of a circle,lighting with his fore paws within an inch of the creature,making even closer snatches at it with his teeth,and jerking his head till his ears flapped again.But he grew tired once more,after a while；tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief；followed an ant around,with his nose close to the floor,and quickly wearied of that；yawned,sighed,forgot the beetle entirely,and sat down on it.Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle；the yelps continued,and so did the dog；he crossed the house in front of the altar；he flew down the other aisle；he crossed before the doors；he clamored up the home-stretch；his anguish grew with his progress,till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light.At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course,and sprang into its master's lap；he flung it out of the window,and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.

By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter,and the sermon had come to a dead standstill.The discourse was resumed presently,but it went lame and halting,all possibility of impressiveness being at an end；for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth,under cover of some remote pew back,as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing.It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced.

Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful,thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it.He had but one marring thought；he was willing that the dog should play with his pinch bug,but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.





CHAPTER Ⅵ


Monday morning found Tom Sawyer miserable.Monday morning always found him so—because it began another week's slow suffering in school.He generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday,it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious.

Tom lay thinking.Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick；then he could stay home from school.Here was a vague possibility.He canvassed his system.No ailment was found,and he investigated again.This time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms,and he began to encourage them with considerable hope.But they soon grew feeble,and presently died wholly away.He reflected further.Suddenly he discovered something.One of his upper front teeth was loose.This was lucky；he was about to begin to groan,as a“starter，”as he called it,when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument,his aunt would pull it out,and that would hurt.So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present,and seek further.Nothing offered for some little time,and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger.So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection.But now he did not know the necessary symptoms.However,it seemed well worth while to chance it,so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.

But Sid slept on unconscious.

Tom groaned louder,and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.

No result from Sid.

Tom was panting with his exertions by this time.He took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.

Sid snored on.

Tom was aggravated.He said，“Sid,Sid！”and shook him.This course worked well,and Tom began to groan again.Sid yawned,stretched,then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort,and began to stare at Tom.Tom went on groaning.Sid said：

“Tom！Say,Tom！”（No response.）“Here,Tom！Tom！What is the matter,Tom?”And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.

Tom moaned out：

“Oh,don't,Sid.Don't joggle me.”

“Why,what's the matter,Tom?I must call auntie.”

“No—never mind.It'll be over by and by,maybe.Don't call anybody.”

“But I must！Don't groan so,Tom,it's awful.How long you been this way?”

“Hours.Ouch！Oh,don't stir so,Sid,you'll kill me.”

“Tom,why didn't you wake me sooner?Oh,Tom,don't！It makes my flesh crawl to hear you.Tom,what is the matter?”

“I forgive you everything,Sid.（Groan.）Everything you've ever done to me.When I'm gone—”

“Oh,Tom,you ain't dying,are you?Don't,Tom—oh,don't.Maybe—”

“I forgive everybody,Sid.（Groan.）Tell'em so,Sid.And Sid,you give my window sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that's come to town,and tell her—”

But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone.Tom was suffering in reality,now,so handsomely was his imagination working,and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone.

Sid flew downstairs and said：

“Oh,Aunt Polly,come！Tom's dying！”

“Dying！”

“Yes'm.Don't wait—come quick！”

“Rubbage！I don't believe it！”

But she fled upstairs,nevertheless,with Sid and Mary at her heels.And her face grew white,too,and her lip trembled.When she reached the bedside she gasped out：

“You,Tom！Tom,what's the matter with you?”

“Oh,auntie,I'm—”

“What's the matter with you—what is the matter with you,child?”

“Oh,auntie,my sore toe's mortified！”

The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little,then cried a little,then did both together.This restored her and she said：

“Tom,what a turn you did give me.Now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this.”

The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe.The boy felt a little foolish,and he said：

“Aunt Polly,it seemed mortified,and it hurt so I never minded my tooth at all.”

“Your tooth,indeed！What's the matter with your tooth?”

“One of them's loose,and it aches perfectly awful.”

“There,there,now,don't begin that groaning again.Open your mouth.Well—your tooth is loose,but you're not going to die about that.Mary,get me a silk thread,and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.”

Tom said：

“Oh,please,auntie,don't pull it out.It don't hurt any more.I wish I may never stir if it does.Please don't,auntie.I don't want to stay home from school.”

“Oh,you don't,don't you?So all this row was because you thought you'd get to stay home from school and go a-fishing?Tom,Tom,I love you so,and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness.”By this time the dental instruments were ready.The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Tom's tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost.Then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy's face.The tooth hung dangling by the bedpost,now.

But all trials bring their compensations.As Tom wended to school after breakfast,he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way.He gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition；and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time,now found himself suddenly without an adherent,and shorn of his glory.His heart was heavy,and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasn't anything to spit like Tom Sawyer；but another boy said，“Sour grapes！”and he wandered away a dismantled hero.

Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village,Huckleberry Finn,son of the town drunkard.Huckleberry was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town,because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad—and because all their children admired him so,and delighted in his forbidden society,and wished they dared to be like him.Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys,in that he envied Huckleberry his gaudy outcast condition,and was under strict orders not to play with him.So he played with him every time he got a chance.Huckleberry was always dressed in the castoff clothes of full-grown men,and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags.His hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim；his coat,when he wore one,hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back；but one suspender supported his trousers；the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing,the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up.

Huckleberry came and went,at his own free will.He slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet；he did not have to go to school or to church,or call any being master or obey anybody；he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose,and stay as long as it suited him；nobody forbade him to fight；he could sit up as late as he pleased；he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall；he never had to wash,nor put on clean clothes；he could swear wonderfully.In a word,everything that goes to make life precious,that boy had.So thought every harassed,hampered,respectable boy in St.Petersburg.

Tom hailed the romantic outcast：

“Hello,Huckleberry！”

“Hello yourself,and see how you like it.”

“What's that you got?”

“Dead cat.”

“Lemme see him,Huck.My,he's pretty stiff.Where'd you get him?”

“Bought him off'n a boy.”

“What did you give?”

“I give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughterhouse.”

“Where'd you get the blue ticket?”

“Bought it off'n Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoopstick.”

“Say—what is dead cats good for,Huck?”

“Good for.Cure warts with.”

“No！Is that so?I know something that's better.”

“I bet you don't.What is it?”

“Why,spunk-water.”

“Spunk-water！I wouldn't give a dern for spunk-water.”

“You wouldn't,wouldn't you?D'you ever try it?”

“No,I hain't.But Bob Tanner did.”

“Who told you so?”

“Why,he told Jeff Thatcher,and Jeff told Johnny Baker,and Johnny told Jim Hollis,and Jim told Ben Rogers,and Ben told a nigger,and the nigger told me.There now！”

“Well,what of it?They'll all lie.Leastways all but the nigger.I don't know him.But I never see a nigger that wouldn't lie.Shucks！Now you tell me how Bob Tanner done it,Huck.”

“Why,he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain-water was.”

“In the daytime?”

“Certainly.”

“With his face to the stump?”

“Yes.Least I reckon so.”

“Did he say anything?”

“I don't reckon he did.I don't know.”

“Aha！Talk about trying to cure warts with spunk-water such a blame fool way as that！Why,that ain't a-going to do any good.You got to go all by yourself,to the middle of the woods,where you know there's a spunk-water stump,and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say：

Barley-corn,Barley-corn,injun-meal shorts，

Spunk-water,spunk-water,swaller these warts，

and then walk away quick,eleven steps,with your eyes shut,and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.Because if you speak the charm's busted.”

“Well,that sounds like a good way；but that ain't the way Bob Tanner done.”

“No,sir,you can bet he didn't,becuz he's the wartiest boy in this town；and he wouldn't have a wart on him if he'd knowed how to work spunk-water.I've took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way,Huck.I play with frogs so much that I've always got considerable many warts.Sometimes I take'em off with a bean.”

“Yes,bean's good.I've done that.”

“Have you?What's your way?”

“You take and split the bean,and cut the wart so as to get some blood,and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it'bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon,and then you burn up the rest of the bean.You see that piece that's got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing,trying to fetch the other piece to it,and so that helps the blood to draw the wart,and pretty soon off she comes.”

“Yes,that's it,Huck—that's it；though when you're burying it if you say'Down bean；off wart；come no more to bother me！'it's better.That's the way Joe Harper does,and he's been nearly to Coonville and most everywheres.But say—how do you cure'em with dead cats?”

“Why,you take your cat and go and get in the grave-yard'long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried；and when it's midnight a devil will come,or maybe two or three,but you can't see'em,you can only hear something like the wind,or maybe hear'em talk；and when they're taking that feller away,you heave your cat after'em and say，’devil follow corpse,cat follow devil,warts follow cat,I'm done with ye！'that'll fetch any wart.”

“Sounds right.D'you ever try it,Huck?”

“No,but old Mother Hopkins told me.”

“Well,I reckon it's so,then.Becuz they say she's a witch.”

“Say！Why,Tom,I know she is.She witched pap.Pap says so his own self.He come along one day,and he see she was a-witching him,so he took up a rock,and if she hadn't dodged,he'd a got her.Well,that very night he rolled off'n a shed wher'he was a-layin'drunk,and broke his arm.”

“Why,that's awful.How did he know she was a-witching him?”

“Lord,pap can tell,easy.Pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy,they're a-witching you.Specially if they mumble.Becuz when they mumble they're saying the Lord's Prayer backwards.”

“Say,Hucky,when you going to try the cat?”

“Tonight.I reckon they'll come after old Hoss Williams tonight.”

“But they buried him Saturday.Didn't they get him Saturday night?”

“Why,how you talk！How could their charms work till midnight?—and then it's Sunday.Devils don't slosh around much of a Sunday,I don't reckon.”

“I never thought of that.That's so.Lemme go with you?”

“Of course—if you ain't afeard.”

“Afeard！'Tain't likely.Will you meow?”

“Yes—and you meow back,if you get a chance.Last time,you kep'me a-meowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and says'Dern that cat！'and so I hove a brick through his window—but don't you tell.”

“I won't.I couldn't meow that night,becuz auntie was watching me,but I'll meow this time.Say—what's that?”

“Nothing but a tick.”

“Where'd you get him?”

“Out in the woods.”

“What'll you take for him?”

“I don't know.I don't want to sell him.”

“All right.It's a mighty small tick,anyway.”

“Oh,anybody can run a tick down that don't belong to them.I'm satisfied with it.It's a good enough tick for me.”

“Sho,there's ticks a-plenty.I could have a thousand of'em if I wanted to.”

“Well,why don't you?Becuz you know mighty well you can't.This is a pretty early tick,I reckon.It's the first one I've seen this year.”

“Say,Huck—I'll give you my tooth for him.”

“Less see it.”

Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it.Huckleberry viewed it wistfully.The temptation was very strong.At last he said：

“Is it genuwyne?”

Tom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.

“Well,all right，”said Huckleberry，“it's a trade.”

Tom enclosed the tick in the percussion-cap box that had lately been the pinch bug's prison,and the boys separated,each feeling wealthier than before.

When Tom reached the little isolated frame school-house,he strode in briskly,with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed.He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with businesslike alacrity.The master,throned on high in his great splint-bottom armchair,was dozing,lulled by the drowsy hum of study.The interruption roused him.

“Thomas Sawyer！”

Tom knew that when his name was pronounced in full,it meant trouble.

“Sir！”

“Come up here.Now,sir,why are you late again,as usual?”

Tom was about to take refuge in a lie,when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love；and by that form was the only vacant place on the girls'side of the schoolhouse.He instantly said：

“I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn！”

The master's pulse stood still,and he stared helplessly.The buzz of study ceased.The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind.The master said：

“You—you did what?”

“Stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.”

There was no mistaking the words.

“Thomas Sawyer,this is the most astounding confession I have ever listened to.No mere ferule will answer for this offence.Take off your jacket.”

The master's arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished.Then the order followed：

“Now,sir,go and sit with the girls！And let this be a warning to you.”

The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy,but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune.He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head.Nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room,but Tom sat still,with his arms upon the long,low desk before him,and seemed to study his book.

By and by attention ceased from him,and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more.Presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl.She observed it，“made a mouth”at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute.When she cautiously faced around again,a peach lay before her.She thrust it away.Tom gently put it back.She thrust it away again,but with less animosity.Tom patiently returned it to its place.Then she let it remain.Tom scrawled on his slate，“Please take it—I got more.”The girl glanced at the words,but made no sign.Now the boy began to draw something on the slate,hiding his work with his left hand.For a time the girl refused to notice；but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs.The boy worked on,apparently unconscious.The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt to see,but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it.At last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered：

“Let me see it.”

Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney.Then the girl's interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else.When it was finished,she gazed a moment,then whispered：

“It's nice—make a man.”

The artist erected a man in the front yard,that resembled a derrick.He could have stepped over the house；but the girl was not hypercritical；she was satisfied with the monster,and whispered：

“It's a beautiful man—now make me coming along.”

Tom drew an hourglass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan.The girl said：

“It's ever so nice—I wish I could draw.”

“It's easy，”whispered Tom，“I'll learn you.”

“Oh,will you?When?”

“At noon.Do you go home to dinner?”

“I'll stay if you will.”

“Good—that's a whack.What's your name?”

“Becky Thatcher.What's yours?Oh,I know.It's Thomas Sawyer.”

“That's the name they lick me by.I'm Tom when I'm good.You call me Tom,will you?”

“Yes.”

Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate,hiding the words from the girl.But she was not backward this time.She begged to see.Tom said：

“Oh,it ain't anything.”

“Yes it is.”

“No it ain't.You don't want to see.”

“Yes I do,indeed I do.Please let me.”

“You'll tell.”

“No I won't—deed and deed and double deed I won't.”

“You won't tell anybody at all?Ever,as long as you live?”

“No,I won't ever tell any body.Now let me.”

“Oh,you don't want to see！”

“Now that you treat me so,I will see.”And she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued,Tom pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed：“I love you.”

“Oh,you bad thing！”And she hit his hand a smart rap,but reddened and looked pleased,nevertheless.

Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow,fateful grip closing on his ear,and a steady lifting impulse.In that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat,under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school.Then the master stood over him during a few awful moments,and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word.But although Tom's ear tingled,his heart was jubilant.

As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study,but the turmoil within him was too great.In turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it；then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains,mountains into rivers,and rivers into continents,till chaos was come again；then in the spelling class,and got“turned down，”by a succession of mere baby words,till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months.





CHAPTER Ⅶ


The harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book,the more his ideas wandered.So at last,with a sigh and a yawn,he gave it up.It seemed to him that the noon recess would never come.The air was utterly dead.There was not a breath stirring.It was the sleepiest of sleepy days.The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.Away off in the flaming sunshine,Cardiff Hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat,tinted with the purple of distance；a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air；no other living thing was visible but some cows,and they were asleep.Tom's heart ached to be free,or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time.His hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer,though he did not know it.Then furtively the percussion-cap box came out.He released the tick and put him on the long flat desk.The creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer,too,at this moment,but it was premature：for when he started thankfully to travel off,Tom turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.

Tom's bosom friend sat next him,suffering just as Tom had been,and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant.This bosom friend was Joe Harper.The two boys were sworn friends all the week,and embattled enemies on Saturdays.Joe took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.The sport grew in interest momently.Soon Tom said that they were interfering with each other,and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick.So he put Joe's slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom.

“Now，”said he，“as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and I'll let him alone；but if you let him get away and get on my side,you're to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.”

“All right,go ahead；start him up.”

The tick escaped from Tom,presently,and crossed the equator.Joe harassed him awhile,and then he got away and crossed back again.This change of base occurred often.While one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest,the other would look on with interest as strong,the two heads bowed together over the slate,and the two souls dead to all things else.At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe.The tick tried this,that,and the other course,and got as excited and as anxious as the boys themselves,but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp,so to speak,and Tom's fingers would be twitching to begin,Joe's pin would deftly head him off,and keep possession.At last Tom could stand it no longer.The temptation was too strong.So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin.Joe was angry in a moment.Said he：

“Tom,you let him alone.”

“I only just want to stir him up a little,Joe.”

“No,sir,it ain't fair；you just let him alone.”

“Blame it,I ain't going to stir him much.”

“Let him alone,I tell you.”

“I won't！”

“You shall—he's on my side of the line.”

“Look here,Joe Harper,whose is that tick?”

“I don't care whose tick he is—he's on my side of the line,and you sha'n't touch him.”

“Well,I'll just bet I will,though.He's my tick and I'll do what I blame please with him,or die！”

A tremendous whack came down on Tom's shoulders,and its duplicate on Joe's；and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it.The boys had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them.He had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it.

When school broke up at noon,Tom flew to Becky Thatcher,and whispered in her ear：

“Put on your bonnet and let on you're going home；and when you get to the corner,give the rest of'em the slip,and turn down through the lane and come back.I'll go the other way and come it over'em the same way.”

So the one went off with one group of scholars,and the other with another.In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane,and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves.Then they sat together,with a slate before them,and Tom gave Becky the pencil and held her hand in his,guiding it,and so created another surprising house.When the interest in art began to wane,the two fell to talking.Tom was swimming in bliss.He said：

“Do you love rats?”

“No！I hate them！”

“Well,I do,too—live ones.But I mean dead ones,to swing round your head with a string.”

“No,I don't care for rats much,anyway.What I like is chewing gum.”

“Oh,I should say so！I wish I had some now.”

“Do you?I've got some.I'll let you chew it awhile,but you must give it back to me.”

That was agreeable,so they chewed it turn about,and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment.

“Was you ever at a circus?”said Tom.

“Yes,and my pa's going to take me again some time,if I'm good.”

“I been to the circus three or four times—lots of times.Church ain't shucks to a circus.There's things going on at a circus all the time.I'm going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.”

“Oh,are you！That will be nice.They're so lovely,all spotted up.”

“Yes,that's so.And they get slathers of money—most a dollar a day,Ben Rogers says.Say,Becky,was you ever engaged?”

“What's that?”

“Why,engaged to be married.”

“No.”

“Would you like to?”

“I reckon so.I don't know.What is it like?”

“Like?Why it ain't like anything.You only just tell a boy you won't ever have anybody but him,ever ever ever,and then you kiss and that's all.Anybody can do it.”

“Kiss?What do you kiss for?”

“Why,that,you know,is to—well,they always do that.”

“Everybody?”

“Why,yes,everybody that's in love with each other.Do you remember what I wrote on the slate?”

“Ye—yes.”

“What was it?”

“I shan't tell you.”

“Shall I tell you?”

“Ye—yes—but some other time.”

“No,now.”

“No,not now—tomorrow.”

“Oh,no,now.Please,Becky—I'll whisper it,I'll whisper it ever so easy.”

Becky hesitating,Tom took silence for consent,and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly,with his mouth close to her ear.And then he added：

“Now you whisper it to me—just the same.”

She resisted,for a while,and then said：

“You turn your face away so you can't see,and then I will.But you mustn't ever tell anybody—will you,Tom?Now you won't,will you?”

“No,indeed,indeed I won't.Now,Becky.”

He turned his face away.She bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered，“I—love—you！”

Then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches,with Tom after her,and took refuge in a corner at last,with her little white apron to her face.Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded：

“Now,Becky,it's all done—all over but the kiss.Don't you be afraid of that—it ain't anything at all.Please,Becky.”And he tugged at her apron and the hands.

By and by she gave up,and let her hands drop；her face,all glowing with the struggle,came up and submitted.Tom kissed the red lips and said：

“Now it's all done,Becky.And always after this,you know,you ain't ever to love anybody but me,and you ain't ever to marry anybody but me,ever never and forever.Will you?”

“No,I'll never love anybody but you,Tom,and I'll never marry anybody but you—and you ain't to ever marry anybody but me,either.”

“Certainly.Of course.That's part of it.And always coming to school or when we're going home,you're to walk with me,when there ain't anybody looking—and you choose me and I choose you at parties,because that's the way you do when you're engaged.”

“It's so nice.I never heard of it before.”

“Oh,it's ever so gay！Why,me and Amy Lawrence—”

The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped,confused.

“Oh,Tom！Then I ain't the first you've ever been engaged to！”

The child began to cry.Tom said：

“Oh,don't cry,Becky,I don't care for her any more.”

“Yes,you do,Tom—you know you do.”

Tom tried to put his arm about her neck,but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall,and went on crying.Tom tried again,with soothing words in his mouth,and was repulsed again.Then his pride was up,and he strode away and went outside.He stood about,restless and uneasy,for a while,glancing at the door,every now and then,hoping she would repent and come to find him.But she did not.Then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong.It was a hard struggle with him to make new advances,now,but he nerved himself to it and entered.She was still standing back there in the corner,sobbing,with her face to the wall.Tom's heart smote him.He went to her and stood a moment,not knowing exactly how to proceed.Then he said hesitatingly：

“Becky,I—I don't care for anybody but you.”

No reply—but sobs.

“Becky”—pleadingly.“Becky,won't you say something?”

More sobs.

Tom got out his chiefest jewel,a brass knob from the top of an andiron,and passed it around her so that she could see it,and said：

“Please,Becky,won't you take it?”

She struck it to the floor.Then Tom marched out of the house and over the hills and far away,to return to school no more that day.Presently Becky began to suspect.She ran to the door；he was not in sight；she flew around to the play yard；he was not there.Then she called：

“Tom！Come back,Tom！”

She listened intently,but there was no answer.She had no companions but silence and loneliness.So she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself；and by this time the scholars began to gather again,and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long,dreary,aching afternoon,with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with.





CHAPTER Ⅷ


Tom dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars,and then fell into a moody jog.He crossed a small“branch”two or three times,because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit.Half an hour later he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit of Cardiff Hill,and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him.He entered a dense wood,picked his pathless way to the centre of it,and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.There was not even a zephyr stirring；the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds；nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a woodpecker,and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound.The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy；his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings.He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands,meditating.It seemed to him that life was but a trouble,at best,and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges,so lately released；it must be very peaceful,he thought,to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever,with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave,and nothing to bother and grieve about,ever any more.If he only had a clean Sunday-school record he could be willing to go,and be done with it all.Now as to this girl.What had he done?Nothing.He had meant the best in the world,and been treated like a dog—like a very dog.She would be sorry some day—maybe when it was too late.Ah,if he could only die temporarily！

But the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time.Tom presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again.What if he turned his back,now,and disappeared mysteriously?What if he went away—ever so far away,into unknown countries beyond the seas—and never came back any more！How would she feel then！The idea of being a clown recurred to him now,only to fill him with disgust.For frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense,when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic.No,he would be a soldier,and return after long years,all warworn and illustrious.No—better still,he would join the Indians,and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the Far West,and away in the future come back a great chief,bristling with feathers,hideous with paint,and prance into Sunday school,some drowsy summer morning,with a bloodcurdling war whoop,and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy.But no,there was something gaudier even than this.He would be a pirate！That was it！Now his future lay plain before him,and glowing with unimaginable splendor.How his name would fill the world,and make people shudder！How gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas,in his long,low,black-hulled racer,the Spirit of the Storm,with his grisly flag flying at the fore！And at the zenith of his fame,how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church,brown and weather-beaten,in his black velvet doublet and trunks,his great jackboots,his crimson sash,his belt bristling with horse pistols,his crime-rusted cutlass at his side,his slouch hat with waving plumes,his black flag unfurled,with the skull and crossbones on it,and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings，“It's Tom Sawyer the Pirate！—the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main！”

Yes,it was settled；his career was determined.He would run away from home and enter upon it.He would start the very next morning.Therefore he must now begin to get ready.He would collect his resources together.He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his Barlow knife.He soon struck wood that sounded hollow.He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively：

“What hasn't come here,come！What's here,stay here！”

Then he scraped away the dirt,and exposed a pine shingle.He took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure house whose bottom and sides were of shingles.In it lay a marble.Tom's astonishment was boundless！He scratched his head with a perplexed air,and said：

“Well,that beats anything！”

Then he tossed the marble away pettishly,and stood cogitating.The truth was,that a superstition of his had failed,here,which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible.If you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations,and left it alone a fortnight,and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used,you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there,meantime,no matter how widely they had been separated.But now,this thing had actually and unquestionably failed.Tom's whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding,but never of its failing before.It did not occur to him that he had tried it several times before,himself,but could never find the hiding places afterward.He puzzled over the matter some time,and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm.He thought he would satisfy himself on that point；so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel-shaped depression in it.He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called：

“Doodlebug,doodlebug,tell me what I want to know！

Doodlebug,doodlebug,tell me what I want to know！”

The sand began to work,and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright.

“He dasn't tell！So it was a witch that done it.I just knowed it.”

He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches,so he gave up discouraged.But it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away,and therefore he went and made a patient search for it.But he could not find it.Now he went back to his treasure house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away；then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way,saying：

“Brother,go find your brother！”

He watched where it stopped,and went there and looked.But it must have fallen short or gone too far；so he tried twice more.The last repetition was successful.The two marbles lay within a foot of each other.

Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest.Tom flung off his jacket and trousers,turned a suspender into a belt,raked away some brush behind the rotten log,disclosing a rude bow and arrow,a lath sword and a tin trumpet,and in a moment had seized these things and bounded away,barelegged,with fluttering shirt.He presently halted under a great elm,blew an answering blast,and then began to tiptoe and look warily out,this way and that.He said cautiously—to an imaginary company：

“Hold,my merry men！Keep hid till I blow.”

Now appeared Joe Harper,as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.Tom called：

“Hold！Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my pass?”

“Guy of Guisborne wants no man's pass.Who art thou that—that—”

“Dares to hold such language，”said Tom,prompting—for they talked“by the book，”from memory.

“Who art thou that dares to hold such language?”

“I,indeed！I am Robin Hood,as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.”

“Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw?Right gladly will I dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood.Have at thee！”

They took their lath swords,dumped their other traps on the ground,struck a fencing attitude,foot to foot,and began a grave,careful combat，“two up and two down.”Presently Tom said：

“Now,if you've got the hang,go it lively！”

So they“went it lively，”panting and perspiring with the work.By and by Tom shouted：

“Fall！fall！Why don't you fall?”

“I sha'n't！Why don't you fall yourself?You're getting the worst of it.”

“Why,that ain't anything.I can't fall；that ain't the way it is in the book.The book says，‘Then with one backhanded stroke he slew poor Guy of Guisborne.'You're to turn around and let me hit you in the back.”

There was no getting around the authorities,so Joe turned,received the whack and fell.

“Now，”said Joe,getting up，“you got to let me kill you.That's fair.”

“Why,I can't do that,it ain't in the book.”

“Well,it's blamed mean—that's all.”

“Well,say,Joe,you can be Friar Tuck or Much the miller's son,and lam me with a quarterstaff；or I'll be the Sheriff of Nottingham and you be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.”

This was satisfactory,and so these adventures were carried out.Then Tom became Robin Hood again,and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound.And at last Joe,representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws,dragged him sadly forth,gave his bow into his feeble hands,and Tom said，“Where this arrow falls,there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree.”Then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died,but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.

The boys dressed themselves,hid their accoutrements,and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more,and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever.





CHAPTER Ⅸ


At half past nine,that night,Tom and Sid were sent to bed,as usual.They said their prayers,and Sid was soon asleep.Tom lay awake and waited,in restless impatience.When it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight,he heard the clock strike ten！This was despair.He would have tossed and fidgeted,as his nerves demanded,but he was afraid he might wake Sid.So he lay still,and stared up into the dark.Everything was dismally still.By and by,out of the stillness,little,scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves.The ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice.Old beams began to crack mysteriously.The stairs creaked faintly.Evidently spirits were abroad.A measured,muffled snore issued from Aunt Polly's chamber.And now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,began.Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder—it meant that somebody's days were numbered.Then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air,and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance.Tom was in an agony.At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun；he began to doze,in spite of himself；the clock chimed eleven,but he did not hear it.And then there came,mingling with his half-formed dreams,a most melancholy caterwauling.The raising of a neighboring window disturbed him.A cry of“Scat！you devil！”and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt's woodshed brought him wide awake,and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the“ell”on all fours.He“meow'd”with caution once or twice,as he went；then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground.Huckleberry Finn was there,with his dead cat.The boys moved off and disappeared in the gloom.At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard.

It was a graveyard of the old-fashioned Western kind.It was on a hill,about a mile and a half from the village.It had a crazy board fence around it,which leaned inward in places,and outward the rest of the time,but stood upright nowhere.Grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery.All the old graves were sunken in,there was not a tombstone on the place；round-topped,worm-eaten boards staggered over the graves,leaning for support and finding none.“Sacred to the memory of”So-and-So had been painted on them once,but it could no longer have been read,on the most of them,now,even if there had been light.

A faint wind moaned through the trees,and Tom feared it might be the spirits of the dead,complaining at being disturbed.The boys talked little,and only under their breath,for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits.They found the sharp new heap they were seeking,and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave.

Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time.The hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness.Tom's reflections grew oppressive.He must force some talk.So he said in a whisper：

“Hucky,do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here?”

Huckleberry whispered：

“I wisht I knowed.It's awful solemn like,ain't it?”

“I bet it is.”

There was a considerable pause,while the boys canvassed this matter inwardly.Then Tom whispered：

“Say,Hucky—do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talking?”

“O'course he does.Least his sperrit does.”

Tom,after a pause：

“I wish I'd said Mister Williams.But I never meant any harm.Everybody calls him Hoss.”

“A body can't be too partic'lar how they talk'bout these-yer dead people,Tom.”

This was a damper,and conversation died again.

Presently Tom seized his comrade's arm and said：

“Sh！”

“What is it,Tom?”And the two clung together with beating hearts.

“Sh！There'tis again！Didn't you hear it?”

“I—”

“There！Now you hear it.”

“Lord,Tom,they're coming！They're coming,sure.What'll we do?”“I dono.Think they'll see us?”

“Oh,Tom,they can see in the dark,same as cats.I wisht I hadn't come.”

“Oh,don't be afeard.I don't believe they'll bother us.We ain't doing any harm.If we keep perfectly still,maybe they won't notice us at all.”

“I'll try to,Tom,but,Lord,I'm all of a shiver.”

“Listen！”

The boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed.A muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.

“Look！See there！”whispered Tom.“What is it?”

“It's devil-fire.Oh,Tom,this is awful.”

Some vague figures approached through the gloom,swinging an old-fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light.Presently Huckleberry whispered with a shudder：

“It's the devils,sure enough.Three of'em！Lordy,Tom,we're goners！Can you pray?”

“I'll try,but don't you be afeard.They ain't going to hurt us.‘Now I lay me down to sleep,I—'“

“Sh！”

“What is it,Huck?”

“They're humans！One of'em is,anyway.One of'em's old Muff Potter's voice.”

“No—'tain't so,is it?”

“I bet I know it.Don't you stir nor budge.He ain't sharp enough to notice us.Drunk,the same as usual,likely—blamed old rip！”

“All right,I'll keep still.Now they're stuck.Can't find it.Here they come again.Now they're hot.Cold again.Hot again.Red hot！They're p'inted right,this time.Say,Huck,I know another o'them voices；it's Injun Joe.”

“That's so—that murderin'half-breed！I'd druther they was devils a dern sight.What kin they be up to?”

The whisper died wholly out,now,for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boys'hiding place.

“Here it is，”said the third voice；and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.

Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it.They cast down their load and began to open the grave.The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees.He was so close the boys could have touched him.

“Hurry,men！”he said,in a low voice；“the moon might come out at any moment.”

They growled a response and went on digging.For some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the shovels discharging their freight of mould and gravel.It was very monotonous.Finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent,and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground.They pried off the lid with their shovels,got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground.The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face.The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it,covered with a blanket,and bound to its place with the rope.Potter took out a large spring-knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said：

“Now the cussed thing's ready,Sawbones,and you'll just out with another five,or here she stays.”

“That's the talk！”said Injun Joe.

“Look here,what does this mean?”said the doctor.“You required your pay in advance,and I've paid you.”

“Yes,and you done more than that，”said Injun Joe,approaching the doctor,who was now standing.“Five years ago you drove me away from your father's kitchen one night,when I come to ask for something to eat,and you said I warn't there for any good；and when I swore I'd get even with you if it took a hundred years,your father had me jailed for a vagrant.Did you think I'd forget?The Injun blood ain't in me for nothing.And now I've got you,and you got to settle,you know！”

He was threatening the doctor,with his fist in his face,by this time.The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground.Potter dropped his knife,and exclaimed：

“Here,now,don't you hit my pard！”and the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main,trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels.Injun Joe sprang to his feet,his eyes flaming with passion,snatched up Potter's knife,and went creeping,catlike and stooping,round and round about the combatants,seeking an opportunity.All at once the doctor flung himself free,seized the heavy headboard of Williams'grave and felled Potter to the earth with it—and in the same instant the half-breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man's breast.He reeled and fell partly upon Potter,flooding him with his blood,and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away in the dark.

Presently,when the moon emerged again,Injun Joe was standing over the two forms,contemplating them.The doctor murmured inarticulately,gave a long gasp or two and was still.The half-breed muttered：

“That score is settled—damn you.”

Then he robbed the body.After which he put the fatal knife in Potter's open right hand,and sat down on the dismantled coffin.Three—four—five minutes passed,and then Potter began to stir and moan.His hand closed upon the knife；he raised it,glanced at it,and let it fall,with a shudder.Then he sat up,pushing the body from him,and gazed at it,and then around him,confusedly.His eyes met Joe's.

“Lord,how is this,Joe?”he said.

“It's a dirty business，”said Joe,without moving.

“What did you do it for?”

“I！I never done it！”

“Look here！That kind of talk won't wash.”

Potter trembled and grew white.

“I thought I'd got sober.I'd no business to drink tonight.But it's in my head yet—worse'n when we started here.I'm all in a muddle；can't recollect anything of it,hardly.Tell me,Joe—honest,now,old feller—did I do it?Joe,I never meant to—’pon my soul and honor,I never meant to,Joe.Tell me how it was,Joe.Oh,it's awful—and him so young and promising.”

“Why,you two was scuffling,and he fetched you one with the headboard and you fell flat；and then up you come,all reeling and staggering like,and snatched the knife and jammed it into him,just as he fetched you another awful clip—and here you've laid,as dead as a wedge till now.”

“Oh,I didn't know what I was a-doing.I wish I may die this minute if I did.It was all on account of the whisky and the excitement,I reckon.I never used a weepon in my life before,Joe.I've fought,but never with weepons.They'll all say that.Joe,don't tell！Say you won't tell,Joe—that's a good feller.I always liked you,Joe,and stood up for you,too.Don't you remember?You won't tell,will you,Joe?”And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer,and clasped his appealing hands.

“No,you've always been fair and square with me,Muff Potter,and I won't go back on you.There,now,that's as fair as a man can say.”

“Oh,Joe,you're an angel.I'll bless you for this the longest day I live.”And Potter began to cry.

“Come,now,that's enough of that.This ain't any time for blubbering.You be off yonder way and I'll go this.Move,now,and don't leave any tracks behind you.”

Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run.The half-breed stood looking after him.He muttered：

“If he's as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being,he won't think of the knife till he's gone so far he'll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself—chicken heart！”

Two or three minutes later the murdered man,the blanketed corpse,the lidless coffin,and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon's.

The stillness was complete again,too.





CHAPTER Ⅹ


The two boys flew on and on,toward the village,speechless with horror.They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time,apprehensively,as if they feared they might be followed.Every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy,and made them catch their breath；and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village,the barking of the aroused watchdogs seemed to give wings to their feet.

“If we can only get to the old tannery before we break down！”whispered Tom,in short catches between breaths.“I can't stand it much longer.”

Huckleberry's hard pantings were his only reply,and the boys fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.They gained steadily on it,and at last,breast to breast,they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond.By and by their pulses slowed down,and Tom whispered：

“Huckleberry,what do you reckon'll come of this?”

“If Doctor Robinson dies,I reckon hanging'll come of it.”

“Do you though?”

“Why,I know it,Tom.”

Tom thought a while,then he said：

“Who'll tell?We?”

“What are you talking about?S'pose something happened and Injun Joe didn't hang?Why,he'd kill us some time or other,just as dead sure as we're a-laying here.”

“That's just what I was thinking to myself,Huck.”

“If anybody tells,let Muff Potter do it,if he's fool enough.He's generally drunk enough.”

Tom said nothing—went on thinking.Presently he whispered：

“Huck,Muff Potter don't know it.How can he tell?”

“What's the reason he don't know it?”

“Because he'd just got that whack when Injun Joe done it.D'you reckon he could see anything?D'you reckon he knowed anything?”

“By hokey,that's so,Tom！”

“And besides,look-a-here—maybe that whack done for him！”

“No，'tain't likely,Tom.He had liquor in him；I could see that；and besides,he always has.Well,when pap's full,you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldn't faza him.He says so,his own self.So it's the same with Muff Potter,of course.But if a man was dead sober,I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him；I dono.”

After another reflective silence,Tom said：

“Hucky,you sure you can keep mum?”

“Tom,we got to keep mum.You know that.That Injun devil wouldn't make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats,if we was to squeak'bout this and they didn't hang him.Now,look-a-here,Tom,less take and swear to one another—that's what we got to do—swear to keep mum.”

“I'm agreed.It's the best thing.Would you just hold hands and swear that we—”

“Oh no,that wouldn't do for this.That's good enough for little rubbishy common things—specially with gals,cuz they go back on you anyway,and blab if they get in a huff—but there orter be writing'bout a big thing like this.And blood.”

Tom's whole being applauded this idea.It was deep,and dark,and awful；the hour,the circumstances,the surroundings,were in keeping with it.He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlight,took a little fragment of“red keel”out of his pocket,got the moon on his work,and painfully scrawled these lines,emphasizing each slow downstroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth,and letting up the pressure on the upstrokes.

“Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.”

Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Tom's facility in writing,and the sublimity of his language.He at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh,but Tom said：

“Hold on！Don't do that.A pin's brass.It might have verdigrease on it.”

“What's verdigrease?”

“It's p'ison.That's what it is.You just swaller some of it once—you'll see.”

So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles,and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood.In time,after many squeezes,Tom managed to sign his initials,using the ball of his little finger for a pen.Then he showed Huckleberry how to make an H and an F,and the oath was complete.They buried the shingle close to the wall,with some dismal ceremonies and incantations,and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away.

A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building,now,but they did not notice it.

“Tom，”whispered Huckleberry，“does this keep us from ever telling—always?”

“Of course it does.It don't make any difference what happens,we got to keep mum.We'd drop down dead—don't you know that?”

“Yes,I reckon that's so.”

They continued to whisper for some little time.Presently a dog set up a long,lugubrious howl just outside—within ten feet of them.The boys clasped each other suddenly,in an agony of fright.

“Which of us does he mean?”gasped Huckleberry.

“I dono—peep through the crack.Quick！”

“No,you,Tom！”

“I can't—I can't do it,Huck！”

“Please,Tom.There'tis again！”

“Oh,lordy,I'm thankful！”whispered Tom.“I know his voice.It's Bull Harbison.”20

“Oh,that's good—I tell you,Tom,I was most scared to death；I'd a bet anything it was a stray dog.”

The dog howled again.The boys'hearts sank once more.

“Oh,my！that ain't no Bull Harbison！”whispered Huckleberry.“Do,Tom！”

Tom,quaking with fear,yielded,and put his eye to the crack.His whisper was hardly audible when he said：

“Oh,Huck,its a stray dog！”

“Quick,Tom,quick！Who does he mean?”

“Huck,he must mean us both—we're right together.”

“Oh,Tom,I reckon we're goners.I reckon there ain't no mistake'bout where I'll go to.I been so wicked.”

“Dad fetch it！This comes of playing hooky and doing everything a feller's told not to do.I might a been good,like Sid,if I'd a tried—but no,I wouldn't,of course.But if ever I get off this time,I lay I'll just waller in Sunday schools！”And Tom began to snuffle a little.

“You bad！”and Huckleberry began to snuffle too.“Consound it,Tom Sawyer,you're just old pie，'longside o'what I am.Oh,lordy,lordy,lordy,I wisht I only had half your chance.”

Tom choked off and whispered：

“Look,Hucky,look！He's got his back to us！”

Hucky looked,with joy in his heart.

“Well,he has,by jingoes！Did he before?”

“Yes,he did.But I,like a fool,never thought.Oh,this is bully,you know.Now who can he mean?”

The howling stopped.Tom pricked up his ears.

“Sh！What's that?”he whispered.

“Sounds like—like hogs grunting.No—it's somebody snoring,Tom.”

“That is it！Where'bouts is it,Huck?”

“I bleeve it's down at'tother end.Sounds so,anyway.Pap used to sleep there,sometimes，'long with the hogs,but laws bless you,he just lifts things when he snores.Besides,I reckon he ain't ever coming back to this town any more.”

The spirit of adventure rose in the boys'souls once more.

“Hucky,do you das't to go if I lead?”

“I don't like to,much.Tom,s'pose it's Injun Joe！”

Tom quailed.But presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boys agreed to try,with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped.So they went tiptoeing stealthily down,the one behind the other.When they had got to within five steps of the snorer,Tom stepped on a stick,and it broke with a sharp snap.The man moaned,writhed a little,and his face came into the moonlight.It was Muff Potter.The boys'hearts had stood still,and their hopes too,when the man moved,but their fears passed away now.They tiptoed out,through the broken weather-boarding,and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word.That long,lugubrious howl rose on the night air again！They turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where Potter was lying,and facing Potter,with his nose pointing heavenward.

“Oh,geeminy,it's him！”exclaimed both boys,in a breath.

“Say,Tom—they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Miller's house，'bout midnight,as much as two weeks ago；and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung,the very same evening；and there ain't anybody dead there yet.”

“Well,I know that.And suppose there ain't.Didn't Gracie Miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next Saturday?”

“Yes,but she ain't dead.And what's more,she's getting better,too.”

“All right,you wait and see.She's a goner,just as dead sure as Muf fPotter's a goner.That's what the niggers say,and they know all about these kind of things,Huck.”

Then they separated,cogitating.When Tom crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent.He undressed with excessive caution,and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade.He was not aware that the gently-snoring Sid was awake,and had been so for an hour.

When Tom awoke,Sid was dressed and gone.There was a late look in the light,a late sense in the atmosphere.He was startled.Why had he not been called—persecuted till he was up,as usual?The thought filled him with bodings.Within five minutes he was dressed and downstairs,feeling sore and drowsy.The family were still at table,but they had finished breakfast.There was no voice of rebuke；but there were averted eyes；there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit's heart.He sat down and tried to seem gay,but it was uphill work；it roused no smile,no response,and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths.

After breakfast his aunt took him aside,and Tom almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged；but it was not so.His aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so；and finally told him to go on,and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave,for it was no use for her to try any more.This was worse than a thousand whippings,and Tom's heart was sorer now than his body.He cried,he pleaded for forgiveness,promised to reform over and over again,and then received his dismissal,feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence.

He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sid；and so the latter's prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary.He moped to school gloomy and sad,and took his flogging,along with Joe Harper,for playing hooky the day before,with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles.Then he betook himself to his seat,rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands,and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.His elbow was pressing against some hard substance.After a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position,and took up this object with a sigh.It was in a paper.He unrolled it.A long,lingering,colossal sigh followed,and his heart broke.It was his brass andiron knob！

This final feather broke the camel's back.





CHAPTER Ⅺ


Close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news.No need of the as yet undreamed-of telegraph；the tale flew from man to man,from group to group,from house to house,with little less than telegraphic speed.Of course the schoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon；the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not.

A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man,and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter—so the story ran.And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the“branch”about one or two o'clock in the morning,and that Potter had at once sneaked off—suspicious circumstances,especially the washing,which was not a habit with Potter.It was also said that the town had been ransacked for this“murderer”（the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict），but that he could not be found.Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction,and the Sheriff“was confident”that he would be captured before night.

All the town was drifting toward the graveyard.Tom's heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession,not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else,but because an awful,unaccountable fascination drew him on.Arrived at the dreadful place,he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle.It seemed to him an age since he was there before.Somebody pinched his arm.He turned,and his eyes met Huckleberry's.Then both looked elsewhere at once,and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance.But everybody was talking,and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.

“Poor fellow！”“Poor young fellow！”“This ought to be a lesson to grave robbers！”“Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him！”This was the drift of remark；and the minister said，“It was a judgment；His hand is here.”

Now Tom shivered from head to heel；for his eye fell upon the stolid face of Injun Joe.At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle,and voices shouted，“It's him！it's him！he's coming himself！”

“Who?Who?”from twenty voices.

“Muff Potter！”

“Hallo,he's stopped！—Look out,he's turning！Don't let him get away！”

People in the branches of the trees over Tom's head said he wasn't trying to get away—he only looked doubtful and perplexed.

“Infernal impudence！”said a bystander；“wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work,I reckon—didn't expect any company.”

The crowd fell apart,now,and the Sheriff came through,ostenta-tiously leading Potter by the arm.The poor fellow's face was haggard,and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him.When he stood before the murdered man,he shook as with a palsy,and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.

“I didn't do it,friends，”he sobbed；“‘pon my word and honor I never done it.”

“Who's accused you?”shouted a voice.

This shot seemed to carry home.Potter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes.He saw Injun Joe,and exclaimed：

“Oh,Injun Joe,you promised me you'd never—”

“Is that your knife?”and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.

Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground.Then he said：

“Something told me't if I didn't come back and get—”Heshud-dered；then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said，“Tell'em,Joe,tell'em—it ain't any use any more.”

Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring,and heard the stonyhearted liar reel off his serene statement,they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head,and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed.And when he had finished and still stood alive and whole,their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and vanished away,for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.

“Why didn't you leave?What did you want to come here for?”somebody said.

“I couldn't help it—I couldn't help it，”Potter moaned.“I wanted to run away,but I couldn't seem to come anywhere but here.”And he fell to sobbing again.

Injun Joe repeated his statement,just as calmly,a few minutes afterward on the inquest,under oath；and the boys,seeing that the lightnings were still withheld,were confirmed in their belief that Joe had sold himself to the devil.He was now become,to them,the most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon,and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face.

They inwardly resolved to watch him,nights,when opportunity should offer,in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.

Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal；and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little！The boys thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction；but they were disappointed,for more than one villager remarked：

“It was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.”

Tom's fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this；and at breakfast one morning Sid said：

“Tom,you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time.”

Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.

“It's a bad sign，”said Aunt Polly,gravely.“What you got on your mind,Tom?”

“Nothing.Nothing't I know of.”But the boy's hand shook so that he spilled his coffee.

“And you do talk such stuff，”Sid said.“Last night you said，‘It's blood,it's blood,that's what it is！'You said that over and over.And you said，‘Don't torment me so—I'll tell！'tell what?What is it you'll tell?”

Everything was swimming before Tom.There is no telling what might have happened,now,but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Polly's face and she came to Tom's relief without knowing it.She said：

“Sho！It's that dreadful murder.I dream about it most every night myself.Sometimes I dream it's me that done it.”

Mary said she had been affected much the same way.Sid seemed satisfied.Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could,and after that he complained of toothache for a week,and tied up his jaws every night.He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching,and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time,and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again.Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded.If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom's disjointed mutterings,he kept it to himself.

It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats,and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind.Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries,though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises；he noticed,too,that Tom never acted as a witness—and that was strange；and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests,and always avoided them when he could.Sid marveled,but said nothing.However,even inquests went out of vogue at last,and ceased to torture Tom's conscience.

Every day or two,during this time of sorrow,Tom watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail-window and smuggled such small comforts through to the“murderer”as he could get hold of.The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village,and no guards were afforded for it；indeed,it was seldom occupied.These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's conscience.

The villagers had a strong desire to tar and feather Injun Joe and ride him on a rail,for body snatching,but so formidable was his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter,so it was dropped.He had been careful to begin both of his inquest statements with the fight,without confessing the grave robbery that preceded it；therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present.





CHAPTER Ⅻ


One of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was,that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about.Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school.Tom had struggled with his pride a few days,and tried to“whistle her down the wind，”but failed.He began to find himself hanging around her father's house,nights,and feeling very miserable.She was ill.What if she should die！There was distraction in the thought.He no longer took an interest in war,nor even in piracy.The charm of life was gone；there was nothing but dreariness left.He put his hoop away,and his bat；there was no joy in them any more.His aunt was concerned.She began to try all manner of remedies on him.She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all newfangled methods of producing health or mending it.She was an inveterate experimenter in these things.When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever,right away,to try it；not on herself,for she was never ailing,but on anybody else that came handy.She was a subscriber for all the“Health”periodicals and phrenological frauds；and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils.All the“rot”they contained about ventilation,and how to go to bed,and how to get up,and what to eat,and what to drink,and how much exercise to take,and what frame of mind to keep one's self in,and what sort of clothing to wear,was all gospel to her,and she never observed that her health journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before.She was as simple-hearted and honest as the day was long,and so she was an easy victim.She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines,and thus armed with death,went about on her pale horse,metaphorically speaking,with“hell following after.”But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise,to the suffering neighbors.

The water treatment was new,now,and Tom's low condition was a windfall to her.She had him out at daylight every morning,stood him up in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water；then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file,and so brought him to；then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and“the yellow stains of it came through his pores”—as Tom said.

Yet notwithstanding all this,the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected.She added hot baths,sitz baths,shower baths,and plunges.The boy remained as dismal as a hearse.She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister plasters.She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's,and filled him up every day with quack cure-alls.

Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time.This phase filled the old lady's heart with consternation.This indifference must be broken up at any cost.Now she heard of Painkiller for the first time.She ordered a lot at once.She tasted it and was filled with gratitude.It was simply fire in a liquid form.She dropped the water treatment and everything else,and pinned her faith to Painkiller.She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result.Her troubles were instantly at rest,her soul at peace again；for the“indifference”was broken up.The boy could not have shown a wilder,heartier interest,if she had built a fire under him.

Tom felt that it was time to wake up；this sort of life might be romantic enough,in his blighted condition,but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it.So he thought over various plans for relief,and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of Painkiller.He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance,and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her.If it had been Sid,she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight；but since it was Tom,she watched the bottle clandestinely.She found that the medicine did really diminish,but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting room floor with it.

One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt's yellow cat came along,purring,eyeing the teaspoon avariciously,and begging for a taste.Tom said：

“Don't ask for it unless you want it,Peter.”

But Peter signified that he did want it.

“You better make sure.”

Peter was sure.

“Now you've asked for it,and I'll give it to you,because there ain't anything mean about me；but if you find you don't like it,you mustn't blame anybody but your own self.”

Peter was agreeable.So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the Painkiller.Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air,and then delivered a war whoop and set off round and round the room,banging against furniture,upsetting flowerpots,and making general havoc.Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around,in a frenzy of enjoyment,with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness.Then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path.Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets,deliver a final mighty hurrah,and sail through the open window,carrying the rest of the flowerpots with him.The old lady stood petrified with astonishment,peering over her glasses；Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.

“Tom,what on earth ails that cat?”

“I don't know,aunt，”gasped the boy.

“Why,I never see anything like it.What did make him act so?”

“Deed I don't know,Aunt Polly；cats always act so when they're having a good time.”

“They do,do they?”There was something in the tone that made Tom apprehensive.

“Yes'm.That is,I believe they do.”

“You do?”

“Yes'm.”

The old lady was bending down,Tom watching,with interest emphasized by anxiety.Too late he divined her“drift.”The handle of the telltale teaspoon was visible under the bed valance.Aunt Polly took it,held it up.Tom winced,and dropped his eyes.Aunt Polly raised him by the usual handle—his ear—and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.

“Now,sir,what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so,for?”

“I done it out of pity for him—because he hadn't any aunt.”

“Hadn't any aunt！—you numskull.What has that got to do with it?”

“Heaps.Because if he'd had one she'd a burnt him out herself！She'd a roasted his bowels out of him'thout any more feeling than if he was a human！”

Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse.This was putting the thing in a new light；what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy,too.She began to soften；she felt sorry.Her eyes watered a little,and she put her hand on Tom's head and said gently：

“I was meaning for the best,Tom.And,Tom,it did do you good.”

Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity.

“I know you was meaning for the best,Auntie,and so was I with Peter.It done him good,too.I never see him get around so since—”

“Oh,go'long with you,Tom,before you aggravate me again.And you try and see if you can't be a good boy,for once,and you needn't take any more medicine.”

Tom reached school ahead of time.It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly.And now,as usual of late,he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades.He was sick,he said,and he looked it.He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking—down the road.Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight,and Tom's face lighted；he gazed a moment,and then turned sorrowfully away.When Jeff arrived,Tom accosted him；and“led up”warily to opportunities for remark about Becky,but the giddy lad never could see the bait.Tom watched and watched,hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight,and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one.At last frocks ceased to appear,and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps；he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer.Then one more frock passed in at the gate,and Tom's heart gave a great bound.The next instant he was out,and“going on”like an Indian；yelling,laughing,chasing boys,jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb,throwing handsprings,standing on his head—doing all the heroic things he could conceive of,and keeping a furtive eye out,all the while,to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing.But she seemed to be unconscious of it all；she never looked.Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there?He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity；came war-whooping around,snatched a boy's cap,hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse,broke through a group of boys,tumbling them in every direction,and fell sprawling,himself,under Becky's nose,almost upsetting her—and she turned,with her nose in the air,and he heard her say：“Mf！some people think they're mighty smart—always showing off！”

Tom's cheeks burned.He gathered himself up and sneaked off,crushed and crestfallen.





CHAPTER ⅩⅢ


Tom's mind was made up now.He was gloomy and desperate.He was a forsaken,friendless boy,he said；nobody loved him；when they found out what they had driven him to,perhaps they would be sorry；he had tried to do right and get along,but they would not let him；since nothing would do them but to be rid of him,let it be so；and let them blame him for the consequences—why shouldn't they?What right had the friendless to complain?Yes,they had forced him to it at last：he would lead a life of crime.There was no choice.

By this time he was far down Meadow Lane,and the bell for school to“take up”tinkled faintly upon his ear.He sobbed,now,to think he should never,never hear that old familiar sound any more—it was very hard,but it was forced on him；since he was driven out into the cold world,he must submit—but he forgave them.Then the sobs came thick and fast.

Just at this point he met his soul's sworn comrade,Joe Harper—hard-eyed,and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.Plainly here were“two souls with but a single thought.”Tom,wiping his eyes with his sleeve,began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return；and ended by hoping that Joe would not forget him.

But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just been going to make of Tom,and had come to hunt him up for that purpose.His mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about；it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go；if she felt that way,there was nothing for him to do but succumb；he hoped she would be happy,and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.

As the two boys walked sorrowing along,they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles.Then they began to lay their plans.Joe was for being a hermit,and living on crusts in a remote cave,and dying,some-time,of cold and want and grief；but after listening to Tom,he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime,and so he consented to be a pirate.

Three miles below St.Petersburg,at a point where the Mississippi River was a trifle over a mile wide,there was a long,narrow,wooded island,with a shallow bar at the head of it,and this offered well as a rendezvous.It was not inhabited；it lay far over toward the further shore,abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest.So Jackson's Island was chosen.Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them.Then they hunted up Huckleberry Finn,and he joined them promptly,for all careers were one to him；he was indifferent.They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the riverbank two miles above the village at the favorite hour—which was midnight.There was a small log raft there which they meant to capture.Each would bring hooks and lines,and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way—as became outlaws.And before the afternoon was done,they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would“hear something.”All who got this vague hint were cautioned to“be mum and wait.”

About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles,and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting place.It was starlight,and very still.The mighty river lay like an ocean at rest.Tom listened a moment,but no sound disturbed the quiet.Then he gave a low,distinct whistle.It was answered from under the bluff.Tom whistled twice more；these signals were answered in the same way.Then a guarded voice said：

“Who goes there?”

“Tom Sawyer,the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main.Name your names.”

“Huck Finn the Red-Handed,and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas.”Tom had furnished these titles,from his favorite literature.

“'Tis well.Give the countersign.”

Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night：

“Blood！”

Then Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it,tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort.There was an easy,comfortable path along the shore under the bluff,but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.

The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon,and had about worn himself out with getting it there.Finn the Red-Handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half-cured leaf tobacco,and had also brought a few corncobs to make pipes with.But none of the pirates smoked or“chewed”but himself.The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said it would never do to start without some fire.That was a wise thought；matches were hardly known there in that day.They saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above,and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk.They made an imposing adventure of it,saying，“Hist！”every now and then,and suddenly halting with finger on lip；moving with hands on imaginary dagger hilts；and giving orders in dismal whispers that if“the foe”stirred,to“let him have it to the hilt，”because“dead men tell no tales.”They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree,but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.

They shoved off,presently,Tom in command,Huck at the after oar and Joe at the forward.Tom stood amidships,gloomy-browed,and with folded arms,and gave his orders in a low,stern whisper：

“Luff,and bring her to the wind！”

“Aye-aye,sir！”

“Steady,steady-y-y-y！”

“Steady it is,sir！”

“Let her go off a point！”

“Point it is,sir！”

As the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid-stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for“style，”and were not intended to mean anything in particular.

“What sail's she carrying?”

“Courses,tops'ls,and flying jib,sir.”

“Send the r'yals up！Lay out aloft,there,half a dozen of ye—foretopmaststuns'l！Lively,now！”

“Aye-aye,sir！”

“Shake out that maintogalans'l！Sheets and braces！Now,my hearties！”

“Aye-aye,sir！”

“Hellum-a-lee—hard aport！Stand by to meet her when she comes！Port,port！Now,men！With a will！Stead-y-y-y！”

“Steady it is,sir！”

The raft drew beyond the middle of the river；the boys pointed her head right,and then lay on their oars.The river was not high,so there was not more than a two or three mile current.Hardly a word was said during the next three-quarters of an hour.Now the raft was passing before the distant town.Two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay,peacefully sleeping,beyond the vague vast sweep of star-gemmed water,unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening.The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms，“looking his last”upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings,and wishing“she”could see him now,abroad on the wild sea,facing peril and death with dauntless heart,going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips.It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jackson's Island beyond eyeshot of the village,and so he“looked his last”with a broken and satisfied heart.The other pirates were looking their last,too；and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island.But they discovered the danger in time,and made shift to avert it.About two o'clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island,and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight.Part of the little raft's belongings consisted of an old sail,and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions；but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather,as became outlaws.

They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest,and then cooked some bacon in the frying pan for supper,and used up half of the corn“pone”stock they had brought.It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island,far from the haunts of men,and they said they never would return to civilization.The climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree trunks of their forest temple,and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.

When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone,and the last allowance of corn pone devoured,the boys stretched themselves out on the grass,filled with contentment.They could have found a cooler place,but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire.

“Ain't it gay?”said Joe.

“It's nuts！”said Tom.“What would the boys say if they could see us?”

“Say?Well,they'd just die to be here—hey,Hucky！”

“I reckon so，”said Huckleberry；“anyways,I'm suited.I don't want nothing better'n this.I don't ever get enough to eat,gen'ally—and here they can't come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.”

“It's just the life for me，”said Tom.“You don't have to get up,mornings,and you don't have to go to school,and wash,and all that blame foolishness.You see a pirate don't have to do anything,Joe,when he's ashore,but a hermit he has to be praying considerable,and then he don't have any fun,anyway,all by himself that way.”

“Oh yes,that's so，”said Joe，“but I hadn't thought much about it,you know.I'd a good deal rather be a pirate,now that I've tried it.”

“You see，”said Tom，“people don't go much on hermits,nowadays,like they used to in old times,but a pirate's always respected.And a hermit's got to sleep on the hardest place he can find,and put sackcloth and ashes on his head,and stand out in the rain,and—”

“What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for?”inquired Huck.

“I dono.But they've got to do it.Hermits always do.You'd have to do that if you was a hermit.”

“Dern'd if I would，”said Huck.

“Well,what would you do?”

“I dono.But I wouldn't do that.”

“Why,Huck,you'd have to.How'd you get around it?”

“Why,I just wouldn't stand it.I'd run away.”

“Run away！Well,you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit.You'd be a disgrace.”

The Red-Handed made no response,being better employed.He had finished gouging out a cob,and now he fitted a weed stem to it,loaded it with tobacco,and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke—he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment.The other pirates envied him this majestic vice,and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly.Presently Huck said：

“What does pirates have to do?”

Tom said：

“Oh,they have just a bully time—take ships and burn them,and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there's ghosts and things to watch it,and kill everybody in the ships—make'em walk a plank.”

“And they carry the women to the island，”said Joe；“they don't kill the women.”

“No，”assented Tom，“they don't kill the women—they're too noble.And the women's always beautiful,too.”

“And don't they wear the bulliest clothes！Oh no！All gold and silver and di'monds，”said Joe,with enthusiasm.

“Who?”said Huck.

“Why,the pirates.”

Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.

“I reckon I ain't dressed fitten for a pirate，”said he,with a regretful pathos in his voice；“but I ain't got none but these.”

But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough,after they should have begun their adventures.They made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with,though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.

Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs.The pipe dropped from the fingers of the Red-Handed,and he slept the sleep of the conscience-free and the weary.The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main had more difficulty in getting to sleep.They said their prayers inwardly,and lying down,since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud；in truth,they had a mind not to say them at all,but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that,lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from Heaven.Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep—but an intruder came,now,that would not“down.”It was conscience.They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away；and next they thought of the stolen meat,and then the real torture came.They tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times；but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities；it seemed to them,in the end,that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only“hooking，”while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing—and there was a command against that in the Bible.So they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business,their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.Then conscience granted a truce,and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep.





CHAPTER ⅩⅣ


When Tom awoke in the morning,he wondered where he was.He sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around.Then he comprehended.It was the cool gray dawn,and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods.Not a leaf stirred；not a sound obtruded upon great Nature's meditation.Beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses.A white layer of ashes covered the fire,and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air.Joe and Huck still slept.

Now,far away in the woods a bird called；another answered；presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard.Gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened,and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself.The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy.A little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf,lifting two-thirds of his body into the air from time to time and“sniffing around，”then proceeding again—for he was measuring,Tom said；and when the worm approached him,of its own accord,he sat as still as a stone,with his hopes rising and falling,by turns,as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere；and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Tom's leg and began a journey over him,his whole heart was glad—for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes—without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform.Now a procession of ants appeared,from nowhere in particular,and went about their labors；one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms,and lugged it straight up a tree trunk.A brown-spotted ladybug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade,and Tom bent down close to it and said，“Ladybug,ladybug,fly away home,your house is on fire,your children's alone，”and she took wing and went off to see about it—which did not surprise the boy,for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations,and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once.A tumblebug came next,heaving sturdily at its ball,and Tom touched the creature,to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead.The birds were fairly rioting by this time.A catbird,the Northern mocker,lit in a tree over Tom's head,and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment；then a shrill jay swept down,a flash of blue flame,and stopped on a twig almost within the boy's reach,cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity；a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the“fox”kind came scurrying along,sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boys,for the wild things had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not.All Nature was wide awake and stirring,now；long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near,and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.

Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout,and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar.They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water.A vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft,but this only gratified them,since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization.

They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed,glad-hearted,and ravenous；and they soon had the campfire blazing up again.Huck found a spring of clear cold water close by,and the boys made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves,and felt that water,sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that,would be a good enough substitute for coffee.While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast,Tom and Huck asked him to hold on a minute；they stepped to a promising nook in the riverbank and threw in their lines；almost immediately they had reward.Joe had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass,a couple of sun perch and a small catfish—provisions enough for quite a family.They fried the fish with the bacon,and were astonished；for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before.They did not know that the quicker a fresh-water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is；and they reflected little upon what a sauce open-air sleeping,open-air exercise,bathing,and a large ingredient of hunger make,too.

They lay around in the shade,after breakfast,while Huck had a smoke,and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition.They tramped gaily along,over decaying logs,through tangled underbrush,among solemn monarchs of the forest,hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grapevines.Now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.

They found plenty of things to be delighted with,but nothing to be astonished at.They discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide,and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide.They took a swim about every hour,so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp.They were too hungry to stop to fish,but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham,and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk.But the talk soon began to drag,and then died.The stillness,the solemnity that brooded in the woods,and the sense of loneliness,began to tell upon the spirits of the boys.They fell to thinking.A sort of undefined longing crept upon them.This took dim shape,presently—it was budding homesickness.Even Finn the Red-Handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads.But they were all ashamed of their weakness,and none was brave enough to speak his thought.

For some time,now,the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance,just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of.But now this mysterious sound became more pronounced,and forced a recognition.The boys started,glanced at each other,and then each assumed a listening attitude.There was a long silence,profound and unbroken；then a deep,sullen boom came floating down out of the distance.

“What is it！”exclaimed Joe,under his breath.

“I wonder，”said Tom in a whisper.

“'Tain't thunder，”said Huckleberry,in an awed tone，“becuz thunder—”

“Hark！”said Tom.“Listen—don't talk.”

They waited a time that seemed an age,and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush.

“Let's go and see.”

They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town.They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water.The little steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village,drifting with the current.Her broad deck seemed crowded with people.There were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat,but the boys could not determine what the men in them were doing.Presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat's side,and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud,that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.

“I know now！”exclaimed Tom；“somebody's drownded！”

“That's it！”said Huck；“they done that last summer,when Bill Turner got drownded；they shoot a cannon over the water,and that makes him come up to the top.Yes,and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in'em and set'em afloat,and wherever there's anybody that's drownded,they'll float right there and stop.”

“Yes,I've heard about that，”said Joe.“I wonder what makes the bread do that.”

“Oh,it ain't the bread,so much，”said Tom；“I reckon it's mostly what they say over it before they start it out.”

“But they don't say anything over it，”said Huck.“I've seen'em and they don't.”

“Well,that's funny，”said Tom.“But maybe they say it to themselves.Of course they do.Anybody might know that.”

The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said,because an ignorant lump of bread,uninstructed by an incantation,could not be expected to act very intelligently when sent upon an errand of such gravity.

“By jings,I wish I was over there,now，”said Joe.

“I do too”said Huck“I'd give heaps to know who it is.”

The boys still listened and watched.Presently a revealing thought flashed through Tom's mind,and he exclaimed：

“Boys,I know who's drownded—it's us！”

They felt like heroes in an instant.Here was a gorgeous triumph；they were missed；they were mourned；hearts were breaking on their account；tears were being shed；accusing memories of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up,and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged；and best of all,the departed were the talk of the whole town,and the envy of all the boys,as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned.This was fine.It was worth while to be a pirate,after all.

As twilight drew on,the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared.The pirates returned to camp.They were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making.They caught fish,cooked supper and ate it,and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them；and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon—from their point of view.But when the shadows of night closed them in,they gradually ceased to talk,and sat gazing into the fire,with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere.The excitement was gone,now,and Tom and Joe could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were.Misgivings came；they grew troubled and unhappy；a sigh or two escaped,unawares.By and by Joe timidly ventured upon a roundabout“feeler”as to how the others might look upon a return to civilization—not right now,but—

Tom withered him with derision！Huck,being uncommitted as yet,joined in with Tom,and the waverer quickly“explained，”and was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken-hearted homesickness clinging to his garments as he could.Mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment.

As the night deepened,Huck began to nod,and presently to snore.Joe followed next.Tom lay upon his elbow motionless,for some time,watching the two intently.At last he got up cautiously,on his knees,and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire.He picked up and inspected several large semicylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore,and finally chose two which seemed to suit him.Then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his“red keel”；one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket,and the other he put in Joe's hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner.And he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value—among them a lump of chalk,an India-rubber ball,three fishhooks,and one of that kind of marbles known as a“sure-'nough crystal.”Then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing,and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.





CHAPTER ⅩⅤ


A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar,wading toward the Illinois shore.Before the depth reached his middle he was halfway over；the current would permit no more wading,now,so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards.He swam quartering upstream,but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected.However,he reached the shore finally,and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out.He put his hand on his jacket pocket,found his piece of bark safe,and then struck through the woods,following the shore,with streaming garments.Shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village,and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.Everything was quiet under the blinking stars.He crept down the bank,watching with all his eyes,slipped into the water,swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did“yawl”duty at the boat's stern.He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited,panting.

Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to“cast off.”A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up,against the boat's swell,and the voyage was begun.Tom felt happy in his success,for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night.At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped,and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk,landing fifty yards downstream,out of danger of possible stragglers.

He flew along unfrequented alleys,and shortly found himself at his aunt's back fence.He climbed over,approached the“ell，”and looked in at the sitting room window,for a light was burning there.There sat Aunt Polly,Sid,Mary,and Joe Harper's mother,grouped together,talking.They were by the bed,and the bed was between them and the door.Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch；then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack；he continued pushing cautiously,and quaking every time it creaked,till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees,so he put his head through and began,warily.

“What makes the candle blow so?”said Aunt Polly.Tom hurried up.“Why,that door's open,I believe.Why,of course it is.No end of strange things now.Go'long and shut it,Sid.”

Tom disappeared under the bed just in time.He lay and“breathed”himself for a time,and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt's foot.

“But as I was saying，”said Aunt Polly，“he warn't bad,so to say—only mischeevous.Only just giddy,and harum-scarum,you know.He warn't any more responsible than a colt.He never meant any harm,and he was the best-hearted boy that ever was”—and she began to cry.

“It was just so with my Joe—always full of his devilment,and up to every kind of mischief,but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be—and laws bless me,to think I went and whipped him for taking that cream,never once recollecting that I throwed it out myself because it was sour,and I never to see him again in this world,never,never,never,poor abused boy！”And Mrs.Harper sobbed as if her heart would break.

“I hope Tom's better off where he is，”said Sid，“but if he'd been better in some ways—”

“Sid！”Tom felt the glare of the old lady's eye,though he could not see it.“Not a word against my Tom,now that he's gone！God'll take care of him—never you trouble yourself,sir！Oh,Mrs.Harper,I don't know how to give him up！I don't know how to give him up！He was such a comfort to me,although he tormented my old heart out of me，'most.”

“The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away—Blessed be the name of the Lord！But it's so hard—Oh,it's so hard！Only last Saturday my Joe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked him sprawling.Little did I know then,how soon—Oh,if it was to do over again I'd hug him and bless him for it.”

“Yes,yes,yes,I know just how you feel,Mrs.Harper,I know just exactly how you feel.No longer ago than yesterday noon,my Tom took and filled the cat full of Painkiller,and I did think the cretur would tear the house down.And God forgive me,I cracked Tom's head with my thimble,poor boy,poor dead boy.But he's out of all his troubles now.And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach—”

But this memory was too much for the old lady,and she broke entirely down.Tom was snuffling,now,himself—and more in pity of himself than anybody else.He could hear Mary crying,and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time.He began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before.Still,he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy—and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature,too,but he resisted and lay still.

He went on listening,and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim；then the small raft had been missed；next,certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should“hear something”soon；the wiseheads had“put this and that together”and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below,presently；but toward noon the raft had been found,lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village—and then hope perished；they must be drowned,else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner.It was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in midchannel,since the boys,being good-swimmers,would otherwise have escaped to shore.This was Wednesday night.If the bodies continued missing until Sunday,all hope would be given over,and the funerals would be preached on that morning.Tom shuddered.

Mrs.Harper gave a sobbing good night and turned to go.Then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's arms and had a good,consoling cry,and then parted.Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her wont,in her good night to Sid and Mary.Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.

Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly,so appealingly,and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,that he was weltering in tears again,long before she was through.

He had to keep still long after she went to bed,for she kept making brokenhearted ejaculations from time to time,tossing unrestfully,and turning over.But at last she was still,only moaning a little in her sleep.Now the boy stole out,rose gradually by the bedside,shaded the candle-light with his hand,and stood regarding her.His heart was full of pity for her.He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle.But something occurred to him,and he lingered considering.His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought；he put the bark hastily in his pocket.Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips,and straightway made his stealthy exit,latching the door behind him.

He threaded his way back to the ferry landing,found nobody at large there,and walked boldly on board the boat,for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman,who always turned in and slept like a graven image.He untied the skiff at the stern,slipped into it,and was soon rowing cautiously upstream.When he had pulled a mile above the village,he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work.He hit the landing on the other side neatly,for this was a familiar bit of work to him.He was moved to capture the skiff,arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate,but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations.So he stepped ashore and entered the woods.

He sat down and took a long rest,torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake,and then started warily down the homestretch.The night was far spent.It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar.He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor,and then he plunged into the stream.A little later he paused,dripping,upon the threshold of the camp,and heard Joe say：

“No,Tom's true-blue,Huck,and he'll come back.He won't desert.He knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate,and Tom's too proud for that sort of thing.He's up to something or other.Now I wonder what?”

“Well,the things is ours,anyway,ain't they?”

“Pretty near,but not yet,Huck.The writing says they are if he ain't back here to breakfast.”

“Which he is！”exclaimed Tom,with fine dramatic effect,stepping grandly into camp.

A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided,and as the boys set to work upon it,Tom recounted（and adorned）his adventures.They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when the tale was done.Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon,and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore.





CHAPTER ⅩⅥ


After dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar.They went about poking sticks into the sand,and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands.Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole.They were perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an English walnut.They had a famous fried egg feast that night,and another on Friday morning.

After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar,and chased each other round and round,shedding clothes as they went,until they were naked,and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar,against the stiff current,which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms,gradually approaching each other,with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays,and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor,and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing,sputtering,laughing,and gasping for breath at one and the same time.

When they were well exhausted,they would run out and sprawl on the dry,hot sand,and lie there and cover themselves up with it,and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more.Finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh-colored“tights”very fairly；so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus—with three clowns in it,for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor.

Next they got their marbles and played“knucks”and“ringtaw”and“keeps”till that amusement grew stale.Then Joe and Huck had another swim,but Tom would not venture,because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle,and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm.He did not venture again until he had found it,and by that time the other boys were tired and ready to rest.They gradually wandered apart,dropped into the“dumps，”and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun.Tom found himself writing“BECKY”in the sand with his big toe；he scratched it out,and was angry with himself for his weakness.But he wrote it again,nevertheless；he could not help it.He erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boys together and joining them.

But Joe's spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection.He was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it.The tears lay very near the surface.Huck was melancholy,too.Tom was downhearted,but tried hard not to show it.He had a secret which he was not ready to tell,yet,but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon,he would have to bring it out.He said,with a great show of cheerfulness：

“I bet there's been pirates on this island before,boys.We'll explore it again.They've hid treasures here somewhere.How'd you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver—hey?”

But it roused only faint enthusiasm,which faded out,with no reply.Tom tried one or two other seductions；but they failed,too.It was discouraging work.Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy.Finally he said：

“Oh,boys,let's give it up.I want to go home.It's so lonesome.”

“Oh no,Joe,you'll feel better by and by，”said Tom.“Just think of the fishing that's here.”

“I don't care for fishing.I want to go home.”

“But,Joe,there ain't such another swimming place anywhere.”

“Swimming's no good.I don't seem to care for it,somehow,when there ain't anybody to say I shan't go in.I mean to go home.”

“Oh,shucks！Baby！You want to see your mother,I reckon.”

“Yes,I do want to see my mother—and you would,too,if you had one.I ain't any more baby than you are.”And Joe snuffled a little.

“Well,we'll let the crybaby go home to his mother,won't we,Huck?Poor thing—does it want to see its mother?And so it shall.You like it here,don't you,Huck?We'll stay,won't we?”

Huck said，“Y-e-s”—without any heart in it.

“I'll never speak to you again as long as I live，”said Joe,rising.“There now！”And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.

“Who cares！”said Tom.“Nobody wants you to.Go'long home and get laughed at.Oh,you're a nice pirate.Huck and me ain't crybabies.We'll stay,won't we,Huck?Let him go if he wants to.I reckon we can get along without him,per'aps.”

But Tom was uneasy,nevertheless,and was alarmed to see Joe go sullenly on with his dressing.And then it was discomforting to see Huck eyeing Joe's preparations so wistfully,and keeping up such an ominous silence.Presently,without a parting word,Joe began to wade off toward the Illinois shore.Tom's heart began to sink.He glanced at Huck.Huck could not bear the look,and dropped his eyes.Then he said：

“I want to go,too,Tom.It was getting so lonesome anyway,and now it'll be worse.Let's us go,too,Tom.”

“I won't！You can all go,if you want to.I mean to stay.”

“Tom,I better go.”

“Well,go'long—who's hendering you.”

Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes.He said：

“Tom,I wisht you'd come,too.Now you think it over.We'll wait for you when we get to shore.”

“Well,you'll wait a blame long time,that's all.”

Huck started sorrowfully away,and Tom stood looking after him,with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too.He hoped the boys would stop,but they still waded slowly on.It suddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still.He made one final struggle with his pride,and then darted after his comrades,yelling：

“Wait！Wait！I want to tell you something！”

They presently stopped and turned around.When he got to where they were,he began unfolding his secret,and they listened moodily till at last they saw the“point”he was driving at,and then they set up a war whoop of applause and said it was“splendid！”and said if he had told them at first,they wouldn't have started away.He made a plausible excuse；but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time,and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.

The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will,chattering all the time about Tom's stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it.After a dainty egg and fish dinner,Tom said he wanted to learn to smoke,now.Joe caught at the idea and said he would like to try,too.So Huck made pipes and filled them.These novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine,and they“bit”the tongue,and were not considered manly anyway.

Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff,charily,and with slender confidence.The smoke had an unpleasant taste,and they gagged a little,but Tom said：

“Why,it's just as easy！If I'd a knowed this was all,I'd a learnt long ago.”

“So would I，”said Joe.“It's just nothing.”

“Why,many a time I've looked at people smoking,and thought well I wish I could do that；but I never thought I could，”said Tom.

“That's just the way with me,hain't it,Huck?You've heard me talk just that way—haven't you,Huck?I'll leave it to Huck if I haven't.”

“Yes—heaps of times，”said Huck.

“Well,I have too，”said Tom；“oh,hundreds of times.Once down by the slaughterhouse.Don't you remember,Huck?Bob Tanner was there,and Johnny Miller,and Jeff Thatcher,when I said it.Don't you remember,Huck，'bout me saying that?”

“Yes,that's so，”said Huck.“That was the day after I lost a white alley.No，'twas the day before.”

“There—I told you so，”said Tom.“Huck recollects it.”

“I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day，”said Joe.“I don't feel sick.”

“Neither do I，”said Tom.“I could smoke it all day.But I bet you Jeff Thatcher couldn't.”

“Jeff Thatcher！Why,he'd keel over just with two draws.Just let him try it once.He'd see！”

“I bet he would.And Johnny Miller—I wish I could see Johnny Miller tackle it once.”

“Oh,don't I！”said Joe.“Why,I bet you Johnny Miller couldn't any more do this than nothing.Just one little snifter would fetch him.”

“'Deed it would,Joe.Say—I wish the boys could see us now.”

“So do I.”

“Say—boys,don't say anything about it,and some time when they're around,I'll come up to you and say，‘Joe,got a pipe?I want a smoke.'And you'll say,kind of careless like,as if it warn't anything,you'll say，‘Yes,I got my old pipe,and another one,but my tobacker ain't very good.’And I'll say，‘Oh,that's all right,if it's strong enough.’And then you'll out with the pipes,and we'll light up just as ca'm,and then just see'em look！”

“By jings,that'll be gay,Tom！I wish it was now！”

“So do I！And when we tell'em we learned when we was off pirating,won't they wish they'd been along?”

“Oh,I reckon not！I'll just bet they will！”

So the talk ran on.But presently it began to flag a trifle,and grow disjointed.The silences widened；the expectoration marvellously increased.Every pore inside the boys'cheeks became a spouting fountain；they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation；little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do,and sudden retchings followed every time.Both boys were looking very pale and miserable,now.Joe's pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers.Tom's followed.Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main.Joe said feebly：

“I've lost my knife.I reckon I better go and find it.”

Tom said,with quivering lips and halting utterance：

“I'll help you.You go over that way and I'll hunt around by the spring.No,you needn't come,Huck—we can find it.”

So Huck sat down again,and waited an hour.Then he found it lonesome,and went to find his comrades.They were wide apart in the woods,both very pale,both fast asleep.But something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it.

They were not talkative at supper that night.They had a humble look,and when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs,they said no,they were not feeling very well—something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them.

About midnight Joe awoke,and called the boys.There was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something.The boys huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire,though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling.They sat still,intent and waiting.The solemn hush continued.Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness.Presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished.By and by another came,a little stronger.Then another.Then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks,and shuddered with the fancy that the Spirit of the Night had gone by.There was a pause.Now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grass blade,separate and distinct,that grew about their feet.And it showed three white,startled faces,too.A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance.A sweep of chilly air passed by,rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire.Another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boys'heads.They clung together in terror,in the thick gloom that followed.A few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves.

“Quick！boys,go for the tent！”exclaimed Tom.

They sprang away,stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark,no two plunging in the same direction.A furious blast roared through the trees,making everything sing as it went.One blinding flash after another came,and peal on peal of deafening thunder.And now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground.The boys cried out to each other,but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly.However,one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent,cold,scared,and streaming with water；but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for.They could not talk,the old sail flapped so furiously,even if the other noises would have allowed them.The tempest rose higher and higher,and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast.The boys seized each others'hands and fled,with many tumblings and bruises,to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank.Now the battle was at its highest.Under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies,everything below stood out in clean-cut and shadowless distinctness：the bending trees,the billowy river,white with foam,the driving spray of spume flakes,the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side,glimpsed through the drifting cloud rack and the slanting veil of rain.Every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth；and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear splitting explosive bursts,keen and sharp,and unspeakably appalling.The storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces,burn it up,drown it to the treetops,blow it away,and deafen every creature on it,all at one and the same moment.It was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in.

But at last the battle was done,and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings,and peace resumed her sway.The boys went back to camp,a good deal awed；but they found there was still something to be thankful for,because the great sycamore,the shelter of their beds,was a ruin,now,blasted by the lightnings,and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened.

Everything in camp was drenched,the campfire as well；for they were but heedless lads,like their generation,and had made no provision against rain.Here was matter for dismay,for they were soaked through and chilled.They were eloquent in their distress；but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against（where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground），that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting；so they patiently wrought until,with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs,they coaxed the fire to burn again.Then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace,and were glad-hearted once more.They dried their boiled ham and had a feast,and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning,for there was not a dry spot to sleep on anywhere around.

As the sun began to steal in upon the boys,drowsiness came over them and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep.They got scorched out by and by,and drearily set about getting breakfast.After the meal they felt rusty,and stiff-jointed,and a little homesick once more.Tom saw the signs,and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could.But they cared nothing for marbles,or circus,or swimming,or anything.He reminded them of the imposing secret,and raised a ray of cheer.While it lasted,he got them interested in a new device.This was to knock off being pirates,for a while,and be Indians for a change.They were attracted by this idea；so it was not long before they were stripped,and striped from head to heel with black mud,like so many zebras—all of them chiefs,of course—and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.

By and by they separated into three hostile tribes,and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful war whoops,and killed and scalped each other by thousands.It was a gory day.Consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one.

They assembled in camp toward suppertime,hungry and happy；but now a difficulty arose—hostile Indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace,and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace.There was no other process that ever they had heard of.Two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates.However,there was no other way；so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed,in due form.

And behold,they were glad they had gone into savagery,for they had gained something；they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife；they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable.They were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort.No,they practised cautiously,after supper,with right fair success,and so they spent a jubilant evening.They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations.We will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag,since we have no further use for them at present.





CHAPTER ⅩⅦ


But there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil Saturday afternoon.The Harpers,and Aunt Polly's family,were being put into mourning,with great grief and many tears.An unusual quiet possessed the village,although it was ordinarily quiet enough,in all conscience.The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air,and talked little；but they sighed often.The Saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children.They had no heart in their sports,and gradually gave them up.

In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard,and feeling very melancholy.But she found nothing there to comfort her.She soliloquized：

“Oh,if I only had a brass andiron knob again！But I haven't got anything now to remember him by.”And she choked back a little sob.

Presently she stopped,and said to herself：

“It was right here.Oh,if it was to do over again,I wouldn't say that—I wouldn't say it for the whole world.But he's gone now；I'll never never never see him any more.”

This thought broke her down and she wandered away,with tears rolling down her cheeks.Then quite a group of boys and girls—playmates of Tom's and Joe's—came by,and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how Tom did so-and-so,the last time they saw him,and how Joe said this and that small trifle（pregnant with awful prophecy,as they could easily see now！）—and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time,and then added something like“and I was a-standing just so—just as I am now,and as if you was him—I was as close as that—and he smiled,just this way—and then something seemed to go all over me,like—awful,you know—and I never thought what it meant,of course,but I can see now！”

Then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life,and many claimed that dismal distinction,and offered evidences,more or less tampered with by the witness；and when it was ultimately decided who did see the departed last,and exchanged the last words with them,the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance,and were gaped at and envied by all the rest.One poor chap,who had no other grandeur to offer,said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance：

“Well,Tom Sawyer he licked me once.”

But that bid for glory was a failure.Most of the boys could say that,and so that cheapened the distinction too much.The group loitered away,still recalling memories of the lost heroes,in awed voices.

When the Sunday-school hour was finished,the next morning,the bell began to toll,instead of ringing in the usual way.It was a very still Sabbath,and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature.The villagers began to gather,loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event.But there was no whispering in the house；only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there.None could remember when the little church had been so full before.There was finally a waiting pause,an expectant dumbness,and then Aunt Polly entered,followed by Sid and Mary,and they by the Harper family,all in deep black,and the whole congregation,the old minister as well,rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.There was another communing silence,broken at intervals by muffled sobs,and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed.A moving hymn was sung,and the text followed：“I am the Resurrection and the Life.”

As the service proceeded,the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces,the winning ways,and the rare promise of the lost lads,that every soul there,thinking he recognized these pictures,felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before,and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor boys.The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of the departed,too,which illustrated their sweet,generous natures,and the people could easily see,now,how noble and beautiful those episodes were,and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities,well deserving of the cowhide.The congregation became more and more moved,as the pathetic tale went on,till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs,the preacher himself giving way to his feelings,and crying in the pulpit.

There was a rustle in the gallery,which nobody noticed；a moment later the church door creaked；the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief,and stood transfixed！First one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister's,and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up the aisle,Tom in the lead,Joe next,and Huck,a ruin of drooping rags,sneaking sheepishly in the rear！They had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon！

Aunt Polly,Mary,and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones,smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings,while poor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable,not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes.He wavered,and started to slink away,but Tom seized him and said：

“Aunt Polly,it ain't fair.Somebody's got to be glad to see Huck.”

“And so they shall.I'm glad to see him,poor motherless thing！”And the loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.

Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice：“Praise God from whom all blessings flow—SING！—and put your hearts in it！”

And they did.Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst,and while it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his life.

As the“sold”congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like that once more.

Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day—according to Aunt Polly's varying moods—than he had earned before in a year；and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.





CHAPTER ⅩⅧ


That was Tom's great secret—the scheme to return home with his brother pirates and attend their own funerals.They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log,at dusk on Saturday,landing five or six miles below the village；they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight,and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.

At breakfast,Monday morning,Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving to Tom,and very attentive to his wants.There was an unusual amount of talk.In the course of it Aunt Polly said：

“Well,I don't say it wasn't a fine joke,Tom,to keep everybody suffering'most a week so you boys had a good time,but it is a pity you could be so hardhearted as to let me suffer so.If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral,you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn't dead,but only run off.”

“Yes,you could have done that,Tom，”said Mary；“and I believe you would if you had thought of it.”

“Would you,Tom?”said Aunt Polly,her face lighting wistfully.“Say,now,would you,if you'd thought of it?”

“I—well,I don't know.'Twould a spoiled everything.”

“Tom,I hoped you loved me that much，”said Aunt Polly,with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy.“It would have been something if you'd cared enough to think of it,even if you didn't do it.”

“Now,auntie,that ain't any harm，”pleaded Mary；“it's only Tom's giddy way—he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.”

“More's the pity.Sid would have thought.And Sid would have come and done it,too.Tom,you'll look back,some day,when it's too late,and wish you'd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little.”

“Now,auntie,you know I do care for you，”said Tom.

“I'd know it better if you acted more like it.”

“I wish now I'd thought，”said Tom,with a repentant tone；“but I dreamt about you,anyway.That's something,ain't it?”

“It ain't much—a cat does that much—but it's better than nothing.What did you dream?”

“Why,Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed,and Sid was sitting by the woodbox,and Mary next to him.”

“Well,so we did.So we always do.I'm glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us.”

“And I dreamt that Joe Harper's mother was here.”

“Why,she was here！Did you dream any more?”

“Oh,lots.But it's so dim,now.”

“Well,try to recollect—can't you?”

“Somehow it seems to me that the wind—the wind blowed the—the—”

“Try harder,Tom！The wind did blow something.Come！”

Tom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute,and then said：

“I've got it now！I've got it now！It blowed the candle！”

“Mercy on us！Go on,Tom—go on！”

“And it seems to me that you said，‘Why,I believe that that door—'”

“Go on,Tom！”

“Just let me study a moment—just a moment.Oh,yes—you said you believed the door was open.”

“As I'm sitting here,I did！Didn't I,Mary！Go on！”

“And then—and then—well I won't be certain,but it seems like as if you made Sid go and—and—”

“Well?Well?What did I make him do,Tom?What did I make him do?”

“You made him—you—Oh,you made him shut it.”

“Well,for the land's sake！I never heard the beat of that in all my days！Don't tell me there ain't anything in dreams,any more.Sereny Harper shall know of this before I'm an hour older.I'd like to see her get around this with her rubbage'bout superstition.Go on,Tom！”

“Oh,it's all getting just as bright as day,now.Next you said I warn't bad,only mischeevous and harum-scarum,and not any more responsible than—than—I think it was a colt,or something.”

“And so it was！Well,goodness gracious！Go on,Tom！”

“And then you began to cry.”

“So I did.So I did.Not the first time,neither.And then—”

“Then Mrs.Harper she began to cry,and said Joe was just the same,and she wished she hadn't whipped him for taking cream when she'd throwed it out her own self—”

“Tom！The sperrit was upon you！You was aprophesying—that's what you was doing！Land alive,go on,Tom！”

“Then Sid he said—he said—”

“I don't think I said anything，”said Sid.

“Yes you did,Sid，”said Mary.

“Shut your heads and let Tom go on！What did he say,Tom?”

“He said—I think he said he hoped I was better off where I was gone to,but if I'd been better sometimes—”

“There,d'you hear that！It was his very words！”

“And you shut him up sharp.”

“I lay I did！There must a been an angel there.There was an angel there,somewheres！”

“And Mrs.Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker,and you told about Peter and the Pain-killer—”

“Just as true as I live！”

“And then there was a whole lot of talk'bout dragging the river for us,and'bout having the funeral Sunday,and then you and old Miss Harper hugged and cried,and she went.”

“It happened just so！It happened just so,as sure as I'm a-sitting in these very tracks.Tom,you couldn't told it more like if you'd a-seen it！And then what?Go on,Tom！”

“Then I thought you prayed for me—and I could see you and hear every word you said.And you went to bed,and I was so sorry that I took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark，‘We ain't dead—we are only off being pirates，'and put it on the table by the candle；and then you looked so good,laying there asleep,that I thought I went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips.”

“Did you,Tom,did you！I just forgive you everything for that！”And she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains.

“It was very kind,even though it was only a—dream，”Sid soliloquized just audibly.

“Shut up,Sid！A body does just the same in a dream as he'd do if he was awake.Here's a big Milum apple I've been saving for you,Tom,if you was ever found again—now go'long to school.I'm thankful to the good God and Father of us all I've got you back,that's long-suffering and merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word,though goodness knows I'm unworthy of it,but if only the worthy ones got His blessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places,there's few enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the long night comes.Go'long Sid,Mary,Tom—take yourselves off—you've hendered me long enough.”

The children left for school,and the old lady to call on Mrs.Harper and vanquish her realism with Tom's marvelous dream.Sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house.It was this：“Pretty thin—as long a dream as that,without any mistakes in it！”

What a hero Tom was become,now！He did not go skipping and prancing,but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him.And indeed it was；he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along,but they were food and drink to him.Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels,as proud to be seen with him,and tolerated by him,as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town.Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all；but they were consuming with envy,nevertheless.They would have given anything to have that swarthy sun-tanned skin of his,and his glittering notoriety；and Tom would not have parted with either for a circus.

At school the children made so much of him and of Joe,and delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes,that the two heroes were not long in becoming insufferably“stuck-up.”They began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners—but they only began；it was not a thing likely to have an end,with imaginations like theirs to furnish material.And finally,when they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around,the very summit of glory was reached.

Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now.Glory was sufficient.He would live for glory.Now that he was distinguished,maybe she would be wanting to“make up.”Well,let her—she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people.Presently she arrived.Tom pretended not to see her.He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk.Soon he observed that she was tripping gaily back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes,pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates,and screaming with laughter when she made a capture；but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity,and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times,too.It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him；and so,instead of winning him it only“set him up”the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about.Presently she gave over skylarking,and moved irresolutely about,sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom.Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else.She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once.She tried to go away,but her feet were treacherous,and carried her to the group instead.She said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow—with sham vivacity：

“Why,Mary Austin！you bad girl,why didn't you come to Sundayschool?”

“I did come—didn't you see me?”

“Why,no！Did you?Where did you sit?”

“I was in Miss Peters'class,where I always go.I saw you.”

“Did you?Why,it's funny I didn't see you.I wanted to tell you about the picnic.”

“Oh,that's jolly.Who's going to give it?”

“My ma's going to let me have one.”

“Oh,goody；I hope she'll let me come.”

“Well,she will.The picnic's for me.She'll let anybody come that I want,and I want you.”

“That's ever so nice.When is it going to be?”

“By and by.Maybe about vacation.”

“Oh,won't it be fun！You going to have all the girls and boys?”

“Yes,every one that's friends to me—or wants to be”；and she glanced ever so furtively at Tom,but he talked right along to Amy Lawrence about the terrible storm on the island,and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree“all to flinders”while he was“standing within three feet of it.”

“Oh,may I come?”said Grace Miller.

“Yes.”

“And me?”said Sally Rogers.

“Yes.”

“And me,too?”said Susy Harper.“And Joe?”

“Yes.”

And so on,with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy.Then Tom turned coolly away,still talking,and took Amy with him.Becky's legs trembled and the tears came to her eyes；she hid these signs with a forced gaiety and went on chattering,but the life had gone out of the picnic,now,and out of everything else；she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call“a good cry.”Then she sat moody,with wounded pride,till the bell rang.She roused up,now,with a vindictive cast in her eye,and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what she'd do.

At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self-satisfaction.And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance.At last he spied her,but there was a sudden falling of his mercury.She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture book with Alfred Temple—and so absorbed were they,and their heads so close together over the book,that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.Jealousy ran red-hot through Tom's veins.He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation.He called himself a fool,and all the hard names he could think of.He wanted to cry with vexation.Amy chatted happily along,as they walked,for her heart was singing,but Tom's tongue had lost its function.He did not hear what Amy was saying,and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent,which was as often misplaced as otherwise.He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse,again and again,to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there.He could not help it.And it maddened him to see,as he thought he saw,that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living.But she did see,nevertheless；and she knew she was winning her fight,too,and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.

Amy's happy prattle became intolerable.Tom hinted at things he had to attend to；things that must be done；and time was fleeting.But in vain—the girl chirped on.Tom thought，“Oh,hang her,ain't I ever going to get rid of her?”At last he must be attending to those things—and she said artlessly that she would be“around”when school let out.And he hastened away,hating her for it.

“Any other boy！”Tom thought,grating his teeth.“Any boy in the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy！Oh,all right,I licked you the first day you ever saw this town,mister,and I'll lick you again！You just wait till I catch you out！I'll just take and—”

And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy—pummelling the air,and kicking and gouging.“Oh,you do,do you?You holler'nough,do you?Now,then,let that learn you！”And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.

Tom fled home at noon.His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's grateful happiness,and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress.Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred,but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer,her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest；gravity and absent-mindedness followed,and then melancholy；two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep,but it was a false hope；no Tom came.At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far.When poor Alfred,seeing that he was losing her,he did not know how,kept exclaiming：“Oh,here's a jolly one！look at this！”she lost patience at last,and said，“Oh,don't bother me！I don't care for them！”and burst into tears,and got up and walked away.

Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her,but she said：

“Go away and leave me alone,can't you！I hate you！”

So the boy halted,wondering what he could have done—for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning—and she walked on,crying.Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse.He was humiliated and angry.He easily guessed his way to the truth—the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself.Tom's spelling book fell under his eye.Here was his opportunity.He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page.

Becky,glancing in at a window behind him at the moment,saw the act,and moved on,without discovering herself.She started homeward,now,intending to find Tom and tell him；Tom would be thankful and their troubles would be healed.Before she was half way home,however,she had changed her mind.The thought of Tom's treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame.She resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling book's account,and to hate him forever,into the bargain.





CHAPTER ⅩⅨ


Tom arrived at home in a dreary mood,and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market：

“Tom,I've a notion to skin you alive！”

“Auntie,what have I done?”

“Well,you've done enough.Here I go over to Sereny Harper,like an old softy,expecting I'm going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream,when lo and behold you she'd found out from Joe that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night.Tom,I don't know what is to become of a boy that will act like that.It makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word.”

This was a new aspect of the thing.His smartness of the morning had seemed to Tom a good joke before,and very ingenious.It merely looked mean and shabby now.He hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment.Then he said：

“Auntie,I wish I hadn't done it—but I didn't think.”

“Oh,child,you never think.You never think of anything but your own selfishness.You could think to come all the way over here from Jackson's Island in the night to laugh at our troubles,and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream；but you couldn't ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow.”

“Auntie,I know now it was mean,but I didn't mean to be mean.I didn't,honest.And besides,I didn't come over here to laugh at you that night.”

“What did you come for,then?”

“It was to tell you not to be uneasy about us,because we hadn't got drownded.”

“Tom,Tom,I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I could believe you ever had as good a thought as that,but you know you never did—and I know it,Tom.”

“Indeed and'deed I did,auntie—I wish I may never stir if I didn't.”“Oh,Tom,don't lie—don't do it.It only makes things a hundred times worse.”

“It ain't a lie,auntie；it's the truth.I wanted to keep you from grieving—that was all that made me come.”

“I'd give the whole world to believe that—it would cover up a power of sins,Tom.I'd'most be glad you'd run off and acted so bad.But it ain't reasonable；because,why didn't you tell me,child?”

“Why,you see,when you got to talking about the funeral,I just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church,and I couldn't somehow bear to spoil it.So I just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum.”

“What bark?”

“The bark I had wrote on to tell you we'd gone pirating.I wish,now,you'd waked up when I kissed you—I do,honest.”

The hard lines in his aunt's face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes.

“Did you kiss me,Tom?”

“Why,yes,I did.”

“Are you sure you did,Tom?”

“Why,yes,I did,auntie—certain sure.”

“What did you kiss me for,Tom?”

“Because I loved you so,and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.”

The words sounded like truth.The old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said：

“Kiss me again,Tom！—and be off with you to school,now,and don't bother me any more.”

The moment he was gone,she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which Tom had gone pirating in.Then she stopped,with it in her hand,and said to herself：

“No,I don't dare.Poor boy,I reckon he's lied about it—but it's a blessed,blessed lie,there's such a comfort come from it.I hope the Lord—I know the Lord will forgive him,because it was such good-heartedness in him to tell it.But I don't want to find out it's a lie.I won't look.”

She put the jacket away,and stood by musing a minute.Twice she put out her hand to take the garment again,and twice she refrained.Once more she ventured,and this time she fortified herself with the thought：“It's a good lie—it's a good lie—I won't let it grieve me.”So she sought the jacket pocket.A moment later she was reading Tom's piece of bark through flowing tears and saying：“I could forgive the boy,now,if he'd committed a million sins！”





CHAPTER ⅩⅩ


There was something about Aunt Polly's manner,when she kissed Tom,that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again.He started to school and had the luck of coming upon Becky Thatcher at the head of Meadow Lane.His mood always determined his manner.Without a moment's hesitation he ran to her and said：

“I acted mighty mean today,Becky,and I'm so sorry.I won't ever,ever do that way again,as long as ever I live—please make up,won't you?”

The girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face：

“I'll thank you to keep yourself to yourself,Mr.Thomas Sawyer.I'll never speak to you again.”

She tossed her head and passed on.Tom was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say“Who cares,Miss Smarty?”until the right time to say it had gone by.So he said nothing.But he was in a fine rage,nevertheless.He moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy,and imagining how he would trounce her if she were.He presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed.She hurled one in return,and the angry breach was complete.It seemed to Becky,in her hot resentment,that she could hardly wait for school to“take in，”she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injured spelling book.If she had had any lingering notion of exposing Alfred Temple,Tom's offensive fling had driven it entirely away.

Poor girl,she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.The master,Mr.Dobbins,had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition.The darling of his desires was,to be a doctor,but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster.Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting.He kept that book under lock and key.There was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it,but the chance never came.Every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book；but no two theories were alike,and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case.Now,as Becky was passing by the desk,which stood near the door,she noticed that the key was in the lock！It was a precious moment.She glanced around；found herself alone,and the next instant she had the book in her hands.The title page—Professor Somebody's Anatomy—carried no information to her mind；so she began to turn the leaves.She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece—a human figure,stark naked.At that moment a shadow fell on the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture.Becky snatched at the book to close it,and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle.She thrust the volume into the desk,turned the key,and burst out crying with shame and vexation.

“Tom Sawyer,you are just as mean as you can be,to sneak up on a person and look at what they're looking at.”

“How could I know you was looking at anything?”

“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,Tom Sawyer；you know you're going to tell on me,and oh,what shall I do,what shall I do！I'll be whipped,and I never was whipped in school.”

Then she stamped her little foot and said：

“Be so mean if you want to！I know something that's going to happen.You just wait and you'll see！Hateful,hateful,hateful！”—and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.

Tom stood still,rather flustered by this onslaught.Presently he said to himself：

“What a curious kind of a fool a girl is！Never been licked in school！Shucks！What's a licking！That's just like a girl—they're so thin-skinned and chicken-hearted.Well,of course I ain't going to tell old Dobbins on this little fool,because there's other ways of getting even on her,that ain't so mean；but what of it?Old Dobbins will ask who it was tore his book.Nobody'll answer.Then he'll do just the way he always does—ask first one and then t'other,and when he comes to the right girl he'll know it,without any telling.Girls'faces always tell on them.They ain't got any backbone.She'll get licked.Well,it's a kind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher,because there ain't any way out of it.”Tom conned the thing a moment longer,and then added：“All right,though；she'd like to see me in just such a fix—let her sweat it out！”

Tom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside.In a few moments the master arrived and school“took in.”Tom did not feel a strong interest in his studies.Every time he stole a glance at the girls'side of the room Becky's face troubled him.Considering all things,he did notwant to pity her,and yet it was all he could do to help it.He could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name.Presently the spelling book discovery was made,and Tom's mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that.Becky roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings.She did not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself；and she was right.The denial only seemed to make the thing worse for Tom.Becky supposed she would be glad of that,and she tried to believe she was glad of it,but she found she was not certain.When the worst came to the worst,she had an impulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple,but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still—because,said she to herself，“he'll tell about me tearing the picture sure.I wouldn't say a word,not to save his life！”

Tom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken-hearted,for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling book himself,in some skylarking bout—he had denied it for form's sake and because it was custom,and had stuck to the denial from principle.

A whole hour drifted by,the master sat nodding on his throne,the air was drowsy with the hum of study.By and by,Mr.Dobbins straightened himself up,yawned,then unlocked his desk,and reached for his book,but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it.Most of the pupils glanced up languidly,but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes.Mr.Dobbins fingered his book absently for a while,then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read！Tom shot a glance at Becky.He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did,with a gun levelled at its head.Instantly he forgot his quarrel with her.Quick—something must be done！done in a flash,too！But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.Good！—he had an inspiration！He would run and snatch the book,spring through the door and fly.But his resolution shook for one little instant,and the chance was lost—the master opened the volume.If Tom only had the wasted opportunity back again！Too late.There was no help for Becky now,he The next moment the master faced the school.Every eye sank under his gaze.There was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear.There was silence while one might count ten—the master was gathering his wrath.Then he spoke：

“Who tore this book?”

There was not a sound.One could have heard a pin drop.The stillness continued；the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.

“Benjamin Rogers,did you tear this book?”

A denial.Another pause.

“Joseph Harper,did you?”

Another denial.Tom's uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings.The master scanned the ranks of boys—considered a while,then turned to the girls：

“Amy Lawrence?”

A shake of the head.

“Gracie Miller?”

The same sign.

“Susan Harper,did you do this?”

Another negative.The next girl was Becky Thatcher.Tom was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation.

“Rebecca Thatcher”（Tom glanced at her face—it was white with terror）—“did you tear—no,look me in the face”（her hands rose in appeal）—“did you tear this book?”

A thought shot like lightning through Tom's brain.He sprang to his feet and shouted—“I done it！”

The school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly.Tom stood a moment,to gather his dismembered faculties；and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise,the gratitude,the adoration that shone upon him out of poor Becky's eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings.Inspired by the splendor of his own act,he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr.Dobbins had ever administered；and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed—for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done,and not count the tedious time as loss,either.

Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Temple；for with shame and repentance Becky had told him all,not forgetting her own treachery；but even the longing for vengeance had to give way,soon,to pleasanter musings,and he fell asleep at last with Becky's latest words lingering dreamily in his ear—

“Tom,how could you be so noble！”





CHAPTER ⅩⅪ


Vacation was approaching.The schoolmaster,always severe,grew severer and more exacting than ever,for he wanted the school to make a good showing on“Examination”day.His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now—at least among the smaller pupils.Only the biggest boys,and young ladies of eighteen and twenty,escaped lashing.Mr.Dobbins'lashings were very vigorous ones,too；for although he carried,under his wig,a perfectly bald and shiny head,he had only reached middle age,and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle.As the great day approached,all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface；he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings.The consequence was,that the smaller boys spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge.They threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief.But he kept ahead all the time.The retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired from the field badly worsted.At last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory.They swore in the sign painter's boy,told him the scheme,and asked his help.He had his own reasons for being delighted,for the master boarded in his father's family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him.The master's wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days,and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan；the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled,and the sign painter's boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on Examination Evening he would“manage the thing”while he napped in his chair；then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school.

In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived.At eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted,and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers.The master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform,with his blackboard behind him.He was looking tolerably mellow.Three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils.To his left,back of the rows of citizens,was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening；rows of small boys,washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort；rows of gawky big boys；snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms,their grandmothers'ancient trinkets,their bits of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair.All the rest of the house was filled with nonparticipating scholars.

The exercises began.A very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited，“You'd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage，”etc.—accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used—supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order.But he got through safely,though cruelly scared,and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired.

A little shamefaced girl lisped，“Mary had a little lamb，”etc.，performed a compassion-inspiring curtsy,got her meed of applause,and sat down flushed and happy.

Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible“Give me liberty or give me death”speech,with fine fury and frantic gesticulation,and broke down in the middle of it.A ghastly stage fright seized him,his legs quaked under him and he was like to choke.True,he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house's silence,too,which was even worse than its sympathy.The master frowned,and this completed the disaster.Tom struggled awhile and then retired,utterly defeated.There was a weak attempt at applause,but it died early.

“The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck”followed；also“The Assyrian Came Down，”and other declamatory gems.Then there were reading exercises,and a spelling fight.The meagre Latin class recited with honor.The prime feature of the evening was in order,now—original“compositions”by the young ladies.Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform,cleared her throat,held up her manuscript（tied with dainty ribbon），and proceeded to read,with labored attention to“expression”and punctuation.The themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them,their grandmothers,and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the Crusades.“Friendship”was one；“Memories of Other Days”；“Religion in History”；“Dream Land”；“The Advantages of Culture”；“Forms of Political Government Compared and Contrasted”；“Melancholy”；“Filial Love”；“Heart Longings，”etc.，etc.

A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy；another was a wasteful and opulent gush of“fine language”；another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out；and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them.No matter what the subject might be,a brain-racking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification.The glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools,and it is not sufficient today；it never will be sufficient while the world stands,perhaps.There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon；and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious.But enough of this.Homely truth is unpalatable.

Let us return to the“Examination.”The first composition that was read was one entitled“Is this,then,Life?”Perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it：

In the common walks of life,with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity！Imagination is busy sketching rose-tinted pictures of joy.In fancy,the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng，“the observed of all observers.”Her graceful form,arrayed in snowy robes,is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance；her eye is brightest,her step is lightest in the gay assembly.

In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by,and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the elysian world,of which she has had such bright dreams.How fairylike does everything appear to her enchanted vision！Each new scene is more charming than the last.But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior,all is vanity,the flattery which once charmed her soul,now grates harshly upon her ear；the ballroom has lost its charms；and with wasted health and imbittered heart,she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul！

And so forth and so on.There was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading,accompanied by whispered ejaculations of“How sweet！”“How eloquent！”“So true！”etc.，and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.

Then arose a slim,melancholy girl,whose face had the“interesting”paleness that comes of pills and indigestion,and read a“poem.”Two stanzas of it will do：



A MISSOURI MAIDEN'S FAREWELL TO ALABAMA

Alabama,good-bye！I love thee well！

But yet for a while do I leave thee now！

Sad,yes,sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell，

And burning recollections throng my brow！

For I have wandered through thy flowery woods；

Have roamed and read near Tallapoosa's stream；

Have listened to Tallassee's warring floods，

And wooed on Coosa's side Aurora's beam.

Yet shame I not to bear an o'er-full heart，

Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes；

'tis from no stranger land I now must part，

'tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs.

Welcome and home were mine within this State，

Whose vales I leave—whose spires fade fast from me

And cold must be mine eyes,and heart,and tête，

When,dear Alabama！they turn cold on thee！

There were very few there who knew what“t te”meant,but the poem was very satisfactory,nevertheless.

Next appeared a dark-complexioned,black-eyed,black-haired young lady,who paused an impressive moment,assumed a tragic expression,and began to read in a measured,solemn tone.



A VISION

Dark and tempestuous was night.Around the throne on high not a single star quivered；but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear；whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven,seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin！Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes,and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene.

At such a time,so dark,so dreary,for human sympathy my very spirit sighed；but instead thereof.

My dearest friend,my counsellor,my comforter and guide—My joy in grief,my second bliss in joy,came to my side.

She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy's Eden by the romantic and young,a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness.So soft was her step,it failed to make even a sound,and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch,as other unobtrusive beauties,she would have glided away unperceived—unsought.A strange sadness rested upon her features,like icy tears upon the robe of December,as she pointed to the contending elements without,and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.

This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non-Presbyterians that it took the first prize.This composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening.The mayor of the village,in delivering the prize to the author of it,made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most“eloquent”thing he had ever listened to,and that Daniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.

It may be remarked,in passing,that the number of compositions in which the word“beauteous”was over-fondled,and human experience referred to as“life's page，”was up to the usual average.

Now the master,mellow almost to the verge of geniality,put his chair aside,turned his back to the audience,and began to draw a map of America on the blackboard,to exercise the geography class upon.But he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand,and a smothered titter rippled over the house.He knew what the matter was and set himself to right it.He sponged out lines and remade them；but he only distorted them more than ever,and the tittering was more pronounced.He threw his entire attention upon his work,now,as if determined not to be put down by the mirth.He felt that all eyes were fastened upon him；he imagined he was succeeding,and yet the tittering continued；it even manifestly increased.And well it might.There was a garret above,pierced with a scuttle over his head；and down through this scuttle came a cat,suspended around the haunches by a string；she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing；as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string,she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air.The tittering rose higher and higher—the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher's head—down,down,a little lower,and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws,clung to it,and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession！And how the light did blaze abroad from the master's bald pate—for the sign painter's boy had gilded it！

That broke up the meeting.The boys were avenged.Vacation had come.

NOTE：—The pretended“compositions”quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled Prose and Poetry,by a Western Lady—but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern,and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.





CHAPTER ⅩⅫ


Tom joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance,being attracted by the showy character of their“regalia.”He promised to abstain from smoking,chewing,and profanity as long as he remained a member.Now he found out a new thing—namely,that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing.Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear；the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order.Fourth of July was coming；but he soon gave that up—gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty-eight hours—and fixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer,justice of the peace,who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral,since he was so high an official.During three days Tom was deeply concerned about the Judge's condition and hungry for news of it.Sometimes his hopes ran high—so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking glass.But the Judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating.At last he was pronounced upon the mend—and then convalescent.Tom was disgusted；and felt a sense of injury,too.He handed in his resignation at once—and that night the Judge suffered a relapse and died.Tom resolved that he would never trust a man like that again.

The funeral was a fine thing.The Cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy.Tom was a free boy again,however—there was something in that.He could drink and swear,now—but found to his surprise that he did not want to.The simple fact that he could,took the desire away,and the charm of it.

Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands.

He attempted a diary—but nothing happened during three days,and so he abandoned it.

The first of all the Negro minstrel shows came to town,and made a sensation.Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days.

Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure,for it rained hard,there was no procession in consequence,and the greatest man in the world（as Tom supposed），Mr.Benton,an actual United States Senator,proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not twenty-five feet high,nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.

A circus came.The boys played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting—admission,three pins for boys,two for girls—and then circusing was abandoned.

A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came—and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever.

There were some boys-and-girls'parties,but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.

Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation—so there was no bright side to life anywhere.

The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery.It was a very cancer for permanency and pain.

Then came the measles.

During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner,dead to the world and its happenings.He was very ill,he was interested in nothing.When he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly down town,a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature.There had been a“revival，”and everybody had“got religion，”not only the adults,but even the boys and girls.Tom went about,hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face,but disappointment crossed him everywhere.He found Joe Harper studying a Testament,and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle.He sought Ben Rogers,and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts.He hunted up Jim Hollis,who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning.Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression；and when,in desperation,he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of Huckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation,his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,forever and forever.

And that night there came on a terrific storm,with driving rain,awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning.He covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom；for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him.He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result.It might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery,but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself.

By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object.The boy's first impulse was to be grateful,and reform.His second was to wait—for there might not be any more storms.

The next day the doctors were back；Tom had relapsed.The three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age.When he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared,remembering how lonely was his estate,how companionless and forlorn he was.He drifted listlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder,in the presence of her victim,a bird.He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating a stolen melon.Poor lads！they—like Tom—had suffered a relapse.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅢ


At last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred—and vigorously：the murder trial came on in the court.It became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately.Tom could not get away from it.Every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart,for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as“feelers”；he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder,but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip.It kept him in a cold shiver all the time.He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him.It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while；to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer.Moreover,he wanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.

“Huck,have you ever told anybody about—that?”

“'Bout what?”

“You know what.”

“Oh—'course I haven't.”

“Never a word?”

“Never a solitary word,so help me.What makes you ask?”

“Well,I was afeard.”

“Why,Tom Sawyer,we wouldn't be alive two days if that got found out.You know that.”

Tom felt more comfortable.After a pause：

“Huck,they couldn't anybody get you to tell,could they?”

“Get me to tell?Why,if I wanted that half-breed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell.They ain't no different way.”

“Well,that's all right,then.I reckon we're safe as long as we keep mum.But let's swear again,anyway.It's more surer.”

“I'm agreed.”

So they swore again with dread solemnities.

“What is the talk around,Huck?I've heard a power of it.”

“Talk?Well,it's just Muff Potter,Muff Potter,Muff Potter all the time.It keeps me in a sweat,constant,so's I want to hide som'ers.”

“That's just the same way they go on round me.I reckon he's a goner.Don't you feel sorry for him,sometimes?”

“Most always—most always.He ain't no account；but then he hain't ever done anything to hurt anybody.Just fishes a little,to get money to get drunk on—and loafs around considerable；but lord,we all do that—leastways most of us—preachers and such like.But he's kind of good—he give me half a fish,once,when there warn't enough for two；and lots of times he's kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.”

“Well,he's mended kites for me,Huck,and knitted hooks on to my line.I wish we could get him out of there.”

“My！we couldn't get him out,Tom.And besides，'twouldn't do any good；they'd ketch him again.”

“Yes—so they would.But I hate to hear'em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done—that.”

“I do too,Tom.Lord,I hear'em say he's the bloodiest looking villain in this country,and they wonder he wasn't ever hung before.”

“Yes,they talk like that,all the time.I've heard'em say that if he was to get free they'd lynch him.”

“And they'd do it,too.”

The boys had a long talk,but it brought them little comfort.As the twilight drew on,they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail,perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties.But nothing happened；there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive.

The boys did as they had often done before—went to the cell grating and gave Potter some tobacco and matches.He was on the ground floor and there were no guards.

His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before—it cut deeper than ever,this time.They felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when Potter said：

“You've been mighty good to me,boys—better'n anybody else in this town.And I don't forget it,I don't.Often I says to myself,says I，‘I used to mend all the boys'kites and things,and show'em where the good fishin'places was,and befriend'em what I could,and now they've all forgot old Muff when he's in trouble；but Tom don't,and Huck don't—they don't forget him,says I，‘and I don't forget them.’Well,boys,I done an awful thing—drunk and crazy at the time—that's the only way I account for it—and now I got to swing for it,and it's right.Right,and best,too,I reckon—hope so,anyway.Well,we won't talk about that.I don't want to make you feel bad；you've befriended me.But what I want to say,is,don't you ever get drunk—then you won't ever get here.Stand a litter furder west—so—that's it；it's a prime comfort to see faces that's friendly when a body's in such a muck of trouble,and there don't none come here but yourn.Good friendly faces—good friendly faces.Git up on one another's backs and let me touch'em.That's it.Shake hands—yourn'll come through the bars,but mine's too big.Little hands,and weak—but they've helped Muff Potter a power,and they'd help him more if they could.”

Tom went home miserable,and his dreams that night were full of horrors.The next day and the day after,he hung about the courtroom,drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in,but forcing himself to stay out.Huck was having the same experience.They studiously avoided each other.Each wandered away,from time to time,but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently.Tom kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom,but invariably heard distressing news—the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor Potter.At the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that Injun Joe's evidence stood firm and unshaken,and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury's verdict would be.

Tom was out late,that night,and came to bed through the window.He was in a tremendous state of excitement.It was hours before he got to sleep.All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning,for this was to be the great day.Both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience.After a long wait the jury filed in and took their places；shortly afterward,Potter,pale and haggard,timid and hopeless,was brought in,with chains upon him,and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him；no less conspicuous was Injun Joe,stolid as ever.There was another pause,and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court.The usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed.These details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating.

Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter washing in the brook,at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered,and that he immediately sneaked away.After some further questioning,counsel for the prosecution said：

“Take the witness.”

The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment,but dropped them again when his own counsel said：

“I have no questions to ask him.”

The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.Counsel for the prosecution said：

“Take the witness.”

“I have no questions to ask him，”Potter's lawyer replied.

A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potter's possession.

“Take the witness.”

Counsel for Potter declined to question him.The faces of the audience began to betray annoyance.Did this attorney mean to throw away his client's life without an effort?

Several witnesses deposed concerning Potter's guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder.They were allowed to leave the stand without being cross-questioned.

Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well,was brought out by credible witnesses,but none of them were cross-examined by Potter's lawyer.The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.Counsel for the prosecution now said：

“By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion,we have fastened this awful crime,beyond all possibility of question,upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar.We rest our case here.”

A groan escaped from poor Potter,and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro,while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom.Many men were moved,and many women's compassion testified itself in tears.Counsel for the defence rose and said：

“Your honor,in our remarks at the opening of this trial,we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink.We have changed our mind.We shall not offer that plea.”（Then to the clerk）：“Call Thomas Sawyer！”

A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house,not even excepting Potter's.Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand.The boy looked wild enough,for he was badly scared.The oath was administered.

“Thomas Sawyer,where were you on the seventeenth of June,about the hour of midnight?”

Tom glanced at Injun Joe's iron face and his tongue failed him.The audience listened breathless,but the words refused to come.After a few moments,however,the boy got a little of his strength back,and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear：

“In the graveyard！”

“A little bit louder,please.Don't be afraid.You were—”

“In the graveyard.”

A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joe's face.

“Were you anywhere near Horse Williams'grave?”

“Yes,sir.”

“Speak up—just a trifle louder.How near were you?”

“Near as I am to you.”

“Were you hidden,or not?”

“I was hid.”

“Where?”

“Behind the elms that's on the edge of the grave.”

Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.

“Any one with you?”

“Yes,sir.I went there with—”

“Wait—wait a moment.Never mind mentioning your companion's name.We will produce him at the proper time.Did you carry anything there with you?”

Tom hesitated and looked confused.

“Speak out,my boy—don't be diffident.The truth is always respectable.What did you take there?”

“Only a—a—dead cat.”

There was a ripple of mirth,which the court checked.

“We will produce the skeleton of that cat.Now,my boy,tell us everything that occurred—tell it in your own way—don't skip anything,and don't be afraid.”

Tom began—hesitatingly at first,but as he warmed up to his subject,his words flowed more and more easily；in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice；every eye fixed itself upon him；with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words,taking no note of time,rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale.The strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said：

“—and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell,Injun Joe jumped with the knife and—”

Crash！Quick as lightning the half-breed sprang for a window,tore his way through all opposers,and was gone！





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅣ


Tom was a glittering hero once more—the pet of the old,the envy of the young.His name even went into immortal print,for the village paper magnified him.There were some that believed he would be President,yet,if he escaped hanging.

As usual,the fickle,unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before.But that sort of conduct is to the world's credit；therefore it is not well to find fault with it.

Tom's days were days of splendor and exultation to him,but his nights were seasons of horror.Injun Joe infested all his dreams,and always with doom in his eye.Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall.Poor Huck was in the same state of wretchedness and terror,for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial,and Huck was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out yet,notwithstanding Injun Joe's flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy,but what of that?Since Tom's harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer's house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths,Huck's confidence in the human race was well-nigh obliterated.

Daily Muff Potter's gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken；but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue.

Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured；the other half he was afraid he would be.He felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.

Rewards had been offered,the country had been scoured,but no Injun Joe was found.One of those omniscient and awe-inspiring marvels,a detective,came up from St.Louis,moused around,shook his head,looked wise,and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve.That is to say,he“found a clew.”But you can't hang a“clew”for murder,and so after that detective had got through and gone home,Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.

The slow days drifted on,and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅤ


There comes a time in every rightly constructed boy's life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure.This desire suddenly came upon Tom one day.He sallied out to find Joe Harper,but failed of success.Next he sought Ben Rogers；he had gone fishing.Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the Red-Handed.Huck would answer.Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially.Huck was willing.Huck was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money.“Where'll we dig?”said Huck.

“Oh,most anywhere.”

“Why,is it hid all around?”

“No,indeed it ain't.It's hid in mighty particular places,Huck—sometimes on islands,sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree,just where the shadow falls at midnight；but mostly under the floor in ha'nted houses.”

“Who hides it?”

“Why,robbers,of course—who'd you reckon?Sunday-school sup'rintendents?”

“I don't know.If'twas mine I wouldn't hide it；I'd spend it and have a good time.”

“So would I.But robbers don't do that way.They always hide it and leave it there.”

“Don't they come after it any more?”

“No,they think they will,but they generally forget the marks,or else they die.Anyway,it lays there a long time and gets rusty；and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks—a paper that's got to be ciphered over about a week because it's mostly signs and hy'roglyphics.”

“Hyro—which?”

“Hy'roglyphics—pictures and things,you know,that don't seem to mean anything.”

“Have you got one of them papers,Tom?”

“No.”

“Well then,how you going to find the marks?”

“I don't want any marks.They always bury it under a ha'nted house or on an island,or under a dead tree that's got one limb sticking out.Well,we've tried Jackson's Island a little,and we can try it again some time；and there's the old ha'nted house up the Still-House branch,and there's lots of dead-limb trees—dead loads of'em.”

“Is it under all of them?”

“How you talk！No！”

“Then how you going to know which one to go for?”

“Go for all of'em！”

“Why,Tom,it'll take all summer.”

“Well,what of that?Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it,all rusty and gray,or a rotten chest full of di'monds.How's that?”

Huck's eyes glowed.

“That's bully.Plenty bully enough for me.Just you gimme the hundred dollars and I don't want no di'monds.”

“All right.But I bet you I ain't going to throw off on di'monds.Some of'em's worth twenty dollars apiece—there ain't any,hardly,but's worth six bits or a dollar.”

“No！Is that so?”

“Cert'nly—anybody'll tell you so.Hain't you ever seen one,Huck?”

“Not as I remember.”

“Oh,kings have slathers of them.”

“Well,I don'know no kings,Tom.”

“I reckon you don't.But if you was to go to Europe you'd see a raft of'em hopping around.”

“Do they hop?”

“Hop?—your granny！No！”

“Well,what did you say they did for?”

“Shucks,I only meant you'd see'em—not hopping,of course—what do they want to hop for?—but I mean you'd just see'em—scattered around,you know,in a kind of a general way.Like that old humpbacked Richard.”

“Richard?What's his other name?”

“He didn't have any other name.Kings don't have any but a given name.”

“No?”

“But they don't.”

“Well,if they like it,Tom,all right；but I don't want to be a king and have only just a given name,like a nigger.But say—where you going to dig first?”

“Well,I don't know.S'pose we tackle that old dead-limb tree on the hill t'other side of Still-House branch?”

“I'm agreed.”

So they got a crippled pick and a shovel,and set out on their three-mile tramp.They arrived hot and panting,and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.

“I like this，”said Tom.

“So do I.”

“Say,Huck,if we find a treasure here,what you going to do with your share?”

“Well,I'll have pie and a glass of soda every day,and I'll go to every circus that comes along.I bet I'll have a gay time.”

“Well,ain't you going to save any of it?”

“Save it?What for?”

“Why,so as to have something to live on,by and by.”

“Oh,that ain't any use.Pap would come back to thish-yer town some day and get his claws on it if I didn't hurry up,and I tell you he'd clean it out pretty quick.What you going to do with yourn,Tom?”

“I'm going to buy a new drum,and a sure-'nough sword,and a red necktie and a bull pup,and get married.”

“Married！”

“That's it.”

“Tom,you—why,you ain't in your right mind.”

“Wait—you'll see.”

“Well,that's the foolishest thing you could do.Look at pap and my mother.Fight！Why,they used to fight all the time.I remember,mighty well.”

“That ain't anything.The girl I'm going to marry won't fight.”

“Tom,I reckon they're all alike.They'll all comb a body.Now you better think'bout this awhile.I tell you you better.What's the name of the gal?”

“It ain't a gal at all—it's a girl.”

“It's all the same,I reckon；some says gal,some says girl—both's right,like enough.Anyway,what's her name,Tom?”

“I'll tell you some time—not now.”

“All right—that'll do.Only if you get married I'll be more lonesomer than ever.”

“No you won't.You'll come and live with me.Now stir out of this and we'll go to digging.”

They worked and sweated for half an hour.No result.They toiled another halfhour.Still no result.Huck said：

“Do they always bury it as deep as this?”

“Sometimes—not always.Not generally.I reckon we haven't got the right place.”

So they chose a new spot and began again.The labor dragged a little,but still they made progress.They pegged away in silence for some time.Finally Huck leaned on his shovel,swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve,and said：

“Where you going to dig next,after we get this one?”

“I reckon maybe we'll tackle the old tree that's over yonder on Cardiff Hill back of the widow's.”

“I reckon that'll be a good one.But won't the widow take it away from us,Tom?It's on her land.”

“She take it away！Maybe she'd like to try it once.Whoever finds one of these hid treasures,it belongs to him.It don't make any difference whose land it's on.”

That was satisfactory.The work went on.By and by Huck said：

“Blame it,we must be in the wrong place again.What do you think?”

“It is mighty curious,Huck.I don't understand it.Sometimes witches interfere.I reckon maybe that's what's the trouble now.”

“Shucks！Witches ain't got no power in the daytime.”

“Well,that's so.I didn't think of that.Oh,I know what the matter is！What a blamed lot of fools we are！You got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight,and that's where you dig！”

“Then consound it,we've fooled away all this work for nothing.Now hang it all,we got to come back in the night.It's an awful long way.Can you get out?”

“I bet I will.We've got to do it tonight,too,because if somebody sees these holes they'll know in a minute what's here and they'll go for it.”

“Well,I'll come around and meow tonight.”

“All right.Let's hide the tools in the bushes.”

The boys were there that night,about the appointed time.They sat in the shadow waiting.It was a lonely place,and an hour made solemn by old traditions.Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves,ghosts lurked in the murky nooks,the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance,an owl answered with his sepulchral note.The boys were subdued by these solemnities,and talked little.By and by they judged that twelve had come；they marked where the shadow fell,and began to dig.Their hopes commenced to rise.Their interest grew stronger,and their industry kept pace with it.The hole deepened and still deepened,but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon something,they only suffered a new disappointment.It was only a stone or a chunk.At last Tom said：

“It ain't any use,Huck,we're wrong again.”

“Well,but we can't be wrong.We spotted the shadder to a dot.”

“I know it,but then there's another thing.”

“What's that?”.

“Why,we only guessed at the time.Like enough it was too late or too early.”

Huck dropped his shovel.

“That's it，”said he.“That's the very trouble.We got to give this one up.We can't ever tell the right time,and besides this kind of thing's too awful,here this time of night with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so.I feel as if something's behind me all the time；and I'm afeard to turn around,becuz maybe there's others in front a-waiting for a chance.I been creeping all over,ever since I got here.”

“Well,I've been pretty much so,too,Huck.They most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree,to look out for it.”

“Lordy！”

“Yes,they do.I've always heard that.”

“Tom,I don't like to fool around much where there's dead people.A body's bound to get into trouble with'em,sure.”

“I don't like to stir'em up,either.S'pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something！”

“Don't Tom！It's awful.”

“Well,it just is.Huck,I don't feel comfortable a bit.”

“Say,Tom,let's give this place up,and try somewheres else.”

“All right,I reckon we better.”

“What'll it be?”

Tom considered awhile；and then said：

“The ha'nted house.That's it！”

“Blame it,I don't like ha'nted houses,Tom.Why,they're a dern sight worse'n dead people.Dead people might talk,maybe,but they don't come sliding around in a shroud,when you ain't noticing,and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth,the way a ghost does.I couldn't stand such a thing as that,Tom—nobody could.”

“Yes,but,Huck,ghosts don't travel around only at night.They won't hender us from digging there in the daytime.”

“Well,that's so.But you know mighty well people don't go about that ha'nted house in the day nor the night.”

“Well,that's mostly because they don't like to go where a man's been murdered,anyway—but nothing's ever been seen around that house except in the night—just some blue lights slipping by the windows—no regular ghosts.”

“Well,where you see one of them blue lights flickering around,Tom,you can bet there's a ghost mighty close behind it.It stands to reason.Becuz you know that they don't anybody but ghosts use'em.”

“Yes,that's so.But anyway they don't come around in the daytime,so what's the use of our being afeard?”

“Well,all right.We'll tackle the ha'nted house if you say so—but I reckon it's taking chances.”

They had started down the hill by this time.There in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood the“ha'nted”house,utterly isolated,its fences gone long ago,rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps,the chimney crumbled to ruin,the window sashes vacant,a corner of the roof caved in.The boys gazed a while,half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window；then talking in a low tone,as befitted the time and the circumstances,they struck far off to the right,to give the haunted house a wide berth,and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff Hill.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅥ


About noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree：they had come for their tools.Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house；Huck was measurably so,also—but suddenly said：

“Looky-here,Tom,do you know what day it is?”

Tom mentally ran over the days of the week,and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them—

“My！I never once thought of it,Huck！”

“Well,I didn't neither,but all at once it popped onto me that it was Friday.”

“Blame it,a body can't be too careful,Huck.We might a got into an awful scrape,tackling such a thing on a Friday.”

“Might！Better say we would！There's some lucky days,maybe,but Friday ain't.”

“Any fool knows that.I don't reckon you was the first that found it out,Huck.”

“Well,I never said I was,did I?And Friday ain't all,neither.I had a rotten bad dream last night—dreampt about rats.”

“No！Sure sign of trouble.Did they fight?”

“No.”

“Well,that's good,Huck.When they don't fight it's only a sign that there's trouble around,you know.All we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it.We'll drop this thing for today,and play.Do you know Robin Hood,Huck?”

“No.Who's Robin Hood?”

“Why,he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England—and the best.He was a robber.”

“Cracky,I wisht I was.Who did he rob?”

“Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings,and such like.But he never bothered the poor.He loved'em.He always divided up with'em perfectly square.”

“Well,he must'a'been a brick.”

“I bet you he was,Huck.Oh,he was the noblest man that ever was.They ain't any such men now,I can tell you.He could lick any man in England,with one hand tied behind him；and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten-cent piece every time,a mile and a half.”

“What's a yew bow?”

“I don't know.It's some kind of a bow,of course.And if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry—and curse.But we'll play Robin Hood—it's nobby fun.I'll learn you.”

“I'm agreed.”

So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon,now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow's prospects and possibilities there.As the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff Hill.

On Saturday,shortly after noon,the boys were at the dead tree again.They had a smoke and a chat in the shade,and then dug a little in their last hole,not with great hope,but merely because Tom said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it,and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel.The thing failed this time,however,so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune,but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure hunting.

When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun,and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place,that they were afraid,for a moment,to venture in.Then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep.They saw a weed-grown,floorless room,unplastered,an ancient fireplace,vacant windows,a ruinous staircase；and here,there,and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs.They presently entered,softly,with quickened pulses,talking in whispers,ears alert to catch the slightest sound,and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.

In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination,rather admiring their own boldness,and wondering at it,too.Next they wanted to look upstairs.This was something like cutting off retreat,but they got to daring each other,and of course there could be but one result—they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent.Up there were the same signs of decay.In one corner they found a closet that promised mystery,but the promise was a fraud—there was nothing in it.Their courage was up now and well in hand.They were about to go down and begin work when—

“Sh！”said Tom.

“What is it?”whispered Huck,blanching with fright.

“Sh！……There！……Hear it?”

“Yes！……Oh,my！Let's run！”

“Keep still！Don't you budge！They're coming right toward the door.”

The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking,and lay waiting,in a misery of fear.

“They've stopped……No—coming……Here they are.Don't whisper another word,Huck.My goodness,I wish I was out of this！”

Two men entered.Each boy said to himself：“There's the old deaf-and-dumb Spaniard that's been about town once or twice lately—never saw t'other man before.”

“T'other”was a ragged,unkempt creature,with nothing very pleasant in his face.The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape；he had bushy white whiskers；long white hair flowed from under his sombrero,and he wore green goggles.When they came in，“t'other”was talking in a low voice；they sat down on the ground,facing the door,with their backs to the wall,and the speaker continued his remarks.His manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded：

“No，”said he，“I've thought it all over,and I don't like it.It's dangerous.”

“Dangerous！”grunted the“deaf-and-dumb”Spaniard—to the vast surprise of the boys.“Milksop！”

This voice made the boys gasp and quake.It was Injun Joe's！There was silence for some time.Then Joe said：

“What's any more dangerous than that job up yonder—but nothing's come of it.”

“That's different.Away up the river so,and not another house about.‘Twon't ever be known that we tried,anyway,long as we didn't succeed.”

“Well,what's more dangerous than coming here in the daytime！—anybody would suspicion us that saw us.”

“I know that.But there warn't any other place as handy after that fool of a job.I want to quit this shanty.I wanted to yesterday,only it warn't any use trying to stir out of here,with those infernal boys playing over there on the hill right in full view.”

“Those infernal boys”quaked again under the inspiration of this remark,and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was Friday and concluded to wait a day.They wished in their hearts they had waited a year.

The two men got out some food and made a luncheon.After a long and thoughtful silence,Injun Joe said：

“Look here,lad—you go back up the river where you belong.Wait there till you hear from me.I'll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more,for a look.We'll do that'dangerous'job after I've spied around a little and think things look well for it.Then for Texas！We'll leg it together！”

This was satisfactory.Both men presently fell to yawning,and Injun Joe said：

“I'm dead for sleep！It's your turn to watch.”

He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore.His comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet.Presently the watcher began to nod；his head drooped lower and lower,both men began to snore now.

The boys drew a long,grateful breath.Tom whispered：

“Now's our chance—come！”

Huck said：

“I can't—I'd die if they was to wake.”

Tom urged—Huck held back.At last Tom rose slowly and softly,and started alone.But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright.He never made a second attempt.The boys lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray；and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting.

Now one snore ceased.Injun Joe sat up,stared around—smiled grimly upon his comrade,whose head was drooping upon his knees—stirred him up with his foot and said：

“Here！You're a watchman,ain't you！All right,though—nothing's happened.”

“My！have I been asleep?”

“Oh,partly,partly.Nearly time for us to be moving,pard.What'll we do with what little swag we've got left?”

“I don't know—leave it here as we've always done,I reckon.No use to take it away till we start south.Six hundred and fifty in silver's something to carry.”

“Well—all right—it won't matter to come here once more.”

“No—but I'd say come in the night as we used to do—it's better.”

“Yes：but look here；it may be a good while before I get the right chance at that job；accidents might happen；'tain't in such a very good place；we'll just regularly bury it—and bury it deep.”

“Good idea，”said the comrade,who walked across the room,knelt down,raised one of the rearward hearth-stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly.He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for Injun Joe and passed the bag to the latter,who was on his knees in the corner,now,digging with his bowie knife.

The boys forgot all their fears,all their miseries in an instant.With gloating eyes they watched every movement.Luck！—the splendor of it was beyond all imagination！Six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boys rich！Here was treasure hunting under the happiest auspices—there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig.They nudged each other every moment—eloquent nudges and easily understood,for they simply meant—“Oh,but ain't you glad now we're here！”

Joe's knife struck upon something.

“Hello！”said he.

“What is it?”said his comrade.

“Half-rotten plank—no,it's a box,I believe.Here—bear a hand and we'll see what it's here for.Never mind,I've broke a hole.”

He reached his hand in and drew it out—

“Man,it's money！”

The two men examined the handful of coins.They were gold.The boys above were as excited as themselves,and as delighted.

Joe's comrade said：

“We'll make quick work of this.There's an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace—I saw it a minute ago.”

He ran and brought the boys'pick and shovel.Injun Joe took the pick,looked it over critically,shook his head,muttered something to himself,and then began to use it.The box was soon unearthed.It was not very large；it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it.The men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence.

“Pard,there's thousands of dollars here，”said Injun Joe.

“'Twas always said that Murrel's gang used to be around here one summer，”the stranger observed.

“I know it，”said Injun Joe；“and this looks like it,I should say.”

“Now you won't need to do that job.”

The half-breed frowned.Said he：

“You don't know me.Least you don't know all about that thing.'Tain't robbery altogether—it's revenge！”and a wicked light flamed in his eyes.“I'll need your help in it.When it's finished—then Texas.Go home to your Nance and your kids,and stand by till you hear from me.”

“Well—if you say so；what'll we do with this—bury it again?”

“Yes.（Ravishing delight overhead.）No！by the great Sachem,no！（Profound distress overhead.）I'd nearly forgot.That pick had fresh earth on it！（The boys were sick with terror in a moment.）What business has a pick and a shovel here?What business with fresh earth on them?Who brought them here—and where are they gone?Have you heard anybody?—seen anybody?What！bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed?Not exactly—not exactly.We'll take it to my den.”

“Why,of course！Might have thought of that before.You mean Number One?”

“No—Number Two—under the cross.The other place is bad—too common.”

“All right.It's nearly dark enough to start.”

Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out.Presently he said：

“Who could have brought those tools here?Do you reckon they can be upstairs?”

The boys'breath forsook them.Injun Joe put his hand on his knife,halted a moment,undecided,and then turned toward the stairway.The boys thought of the closet,but their strength was gone.The steps came creaking up the stairs—the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads—they were about to spring for the closet,when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway.He gathered himself up cursing,and his comrade said：

“Now what's the use of all that?If it's anybody,and they're up there,let them stay there—who cares?If they want to jump down,now,and get into trouble,who objects?It will be dark in fifteen minutes—and then let them follow us if they want to.I'm willing.In my opinion,whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something.I'll bet they're running yet.”

Joe grumbled awhile；then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight,and moved toward the river with their precious box.

Tom and Huck rose up,weak but vastly relieved,and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house.Follow?Not they.They were content to reach ground again without broken necks,and take the townward track over the hill.They did not talk much.They were too much absorbed in hating themselves—hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there.But for that,Injun Joe never would have suspected.He would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his“revenge”was satisfied,and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing.Bitter,bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there！

They resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job,and follow him to“Number Two，”wherever that might be.Then a ghastly thought occurred to Tom.

“Revenge?What if he means us,Huck！”

“Oh,don't！”said Huck,nearly fainting.

They talked it all over,and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else—at least that he might at least mean nobody but Tom,since only Tom had testified.

Very,very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger！Company would be a palpable improvement,he thought.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅦ


The adventure of the day mightily tormented Tom's dreams that night.Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune.As he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure,he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away—somewhat as if they had happened in another world,or in a time long gone by.Then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream！There was one very strong argument in favor of this idea—namely,that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real.He had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before,and he was like all boys of his age and station in life,in that he imagined that all references to“hundreds”and“thousands”were mere fanciful forms of speech,and that no such sums really existed in the world.He never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one's possession.If his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed,they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague,splendid,ungraspable dollars.

But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over,and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream,after all.This uncertainty must be swept away.He would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find Huck.

Huck was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat,listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy.Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to the subject.If he did not do it,then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream.

“Hello,Huck！”

“Hello,yourself.”

Silence,for a minute.

“Tom,if we'd'a'left the blame tools at the dead tree,we'd'a'got the money.Oh,ain't it awful！”

“'Tain't a dream,then，'tain't a dream！Somehow I most wish it was.Dog'd if I don't,Huck.”

“What ain't a dream?”

“Oh,that thing yesterday.I been half thinking it was.”

“Dream！If them stairs hadn't broke down you'd'a'seen how much dream it was！I've had dreams enough all night—with that patch-eyed Spanish devil going for me all through'em—rot him！”

“No,not rot him.Find him！Track the money！”

“Tom,we'll never find him.A feller don't have only one chance for such a pile—and that one's lost.I'd feel mighty shaky if I was to see him,anyway.”

“Well,so'd I；but I'd like to see him,anyway—and track him out—to his Number Two.”

“Number Two—yes,that's it.I been thinking'bout that.But I can't make nothing out of it.What do you reckon it is?”

“I dono.It's too deep.Say,Huck—maybe it's the number of a house！”

“Goody！……No,Tom,that ain't it.If it is,it ain't in this one-horse town.They ain't no numbers here.”

“Well,that's so.Lemme think a minute.Here—it's the number of a room—in a tavern,you know！”

“Oh,that's the trick！They ain't only two taverns.We can find out quick.”

“You stay here,Huck,till I come.”

Tom was off at once.He did not care to have Huck's company in public places.He was gone half an hour.He found that in the best tavern,No.2 had long been occupied by a young lawyer,and was still so occupied.In the less ostentatious house,No.2 was a mystery.The tavern-keeper's young son said it was kept locked all the time,and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night；he did not know any particular reason for this state of things；had had some little curiosity,but it was rather feeble；had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was“ha'nted”；had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.

“That's what I've found out,Huck.I reckon that's the very No.2 we're after.”

“I reckon it is,Tom.Now what you going to do?”

“Lemme think.”

Tom thought a long time.Then he said：

“I'll tell you.The back door of that No.2 is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattletrap of a brick store.Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find,and I'll nip all of Auntie's,and the first dark night we'll go there and try'em.And mind you,keep a lookout for Injun Joe,because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge.If you see him,you just follow him；and if he don't go to that No.2，that ain't the place.”

“Lordy,I don't want to foller him by myself！”

“Why,it'll be night,sure.He mightn't ever see you—and if he did,maybe he'd never think anything.”

“Well,if it's pretty dark I reckon I'll track him.I dono—I dono.I'll try.”

“You bet I'll follow him,if it's dark,Huck.Why,he might'a'found out he couldn't get his revenge,and be going right after that money.”

“It's so,Tom,it's so.I'll foller him；I will,by jingoes！”

“Now you're talking！Don't you ever weaken,Huck,and I won't.”





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅧ


That night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure.They hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine,one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door.Nobody entered the alley or left it；nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left the tavern door.The night promised to be a fair one；so Tom went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on,Huck was to come and“maow，”whereupon he would slip out and try the keys.But the night remained clear,and Huck closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.

Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck.Also Wednesday.But Thursday night promised better.Tom slipped out in good season with his aunt's old tin lantern,and a large towel to blindfold it with.He hid the lantern in Huck's sugar hogshead and the watch began.An hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights（the only ones thereabouts）were put out.No Spaniard had been seen.Nobody had entered or left the alley.Everything was auspicious.The blackness of darkness reigned,the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder.

Tom got his lantern,lit it in the hogshead,wrapped it closely in the towel,and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley.Then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Huck's spirits like a mountain.He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern—it would frighten him,but it would at least tell him that Tom was alive yet.It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared.Surely he must have fainted；maybe he was dead；maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement.In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley；fearing all sorts of dreadful things,and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath.There was not much to take away,for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls,and his heart would soon wear itself out,the way it was beating.Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom came tearing by him：

“Run！”said he；“run,for your life！”

He needn't have repeated it；once was enough；Huck was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered.The boys never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughterhouse at the lower end of the village.Just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down.As soon as Tom got his breath he said：

“Huck,it was awful！I tried two of the keys,just as soft as I could！but they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldn't hardly get my breath I was so scared.They wouldn't turn in the lock,either.Well,without noticing what I was doing,I took hold of the knob,and open comes the door！It warn't locked！I hopped in,and shook off the towel,and,great Caesar's ghost！”

“What！—what'd you see,Tom?”

“Huck,I most stepped onto Injun Joe's hand！”

“No！”

“Yes！He was lying there,sound asleep on the floor,with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out.”

“Lordy,what did you do?Did he wake up?”

“No,never budged.Drunk,I reckon.I just grabbed that towel and started！”

“I'd never'a'thought of the towel,I bet！”

“Well,I would.My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.”

“Say,Tom,did you see that box?”

“Huck,I didn't wait to look around.I didn't see the box,I didn't see the cross.I didn't see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by Injun Joe；yes,I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room.Don't you see,now,what's the matter with that ha'nted room?”

“How?”

“Why,it's ha'nted with whiskey！Maybe all the Temperance Taverns have got a ha'nted room,hey,Huck?”

“Well,I reckon maybe that's so.Who'd'a'thought such a thing?But say,Tom,now's a mighty good time to get that box,if Injun Joe's drunk.”

“It is,that！You try it！”

Huck shuddered.

“Well,no—I reckon not.”

“And I reckon not,Huck.Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe ain't enough.If there'd been three,he'd be drunk enough and I'd do it.”

There was a long pause for reflection,and then Tom said：

“Looky-here,Huck,less not try that thing any more till we know Injun Joe's not in there.It's too scary.Now,if we watch every night,we'll be dead sure to see him go out,some time or other,and then we'll snatch that box quicker'n lightning.”

“Well,I'm agreed.I'll watch the whole night long,and I'll do it every night,too,if you'll do the other part of the job.”

“All right,I will.All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street a block and meow—and if I'm asleep,you throw some gravel at the window and that'll fetch me.”

“Agreed,and good as wheat！”

“Now,Huck,the storm's over,and I'll go home.It'll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours.You go back and watch that long,will you?”

“I said I would,Tom,and I will.I'll ha'nt that tavern every night for a year！I'll sleep all day and I'll stand watch all night.”

“That's all right.Now,where you going to sleep?”

“In Ben Rogers'hayloft.He lets me,and so does his pap's nigger-man,Uncle Jake.I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to,and any time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.That's a mighty good nigger,Tom.He likes me,becuz I don't ever act as if I was above him.Sometime,I've set right down and eat with him.But you needn't tell that.A body's got to do things when he's awful hungry he wouldn't want to do as a steady thing.”

“Well,if I don't want you in the daytime,I'll let you sleep.I won't come bothering around.Any time you see something's up,in the night,just skip right around and meow.”





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅨ


The first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news—Judge Thatcher's family had come back to town the night before.Both Injun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment,and Becky took the chief place in the boy's interest.He saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing“hi-spy”and“gully-keeper”with a crowd of their schoolmates.The day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way：Becky teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long-promised and long-delayed picnic,and she consented.The child's delight was boundless；and Tom's not more moderate.The invitations were sent out before sunset,and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation.Tom's excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour,and he had good hopes of hearing Huck's“meow，”and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickers with,next day；but he was disappointed.No signal came that night.

Morning came,eventually,and by ten or eleven o'clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at Judge Thatcher's,and everything was ready for a start.It was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence.The children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty-three or thereabouts.The old steam ferryboat was chartered for the occasion；presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision baskets.Sid was sick and had to miss the fun；Mary remained at home to entertain him.The last thing Mrs.Thatcher said to Becky,was：

“You'll not get back till late.Perhaps you'd better stay all night with some of the girls that live near the ferry landing,child.”

“Then I'll stay with Susy Harper,mamma.”

“Very well.And mind and behave yourself and don't be any trouble.”

Presently,as they tripped along,Tom said to Becky：

“Say—I'll tell you what we'll do.'Stead of going to Joe Harper's we'll climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas’.She'll have ice-cream！She has it most every day—dead loads of it.And she'll be awful glad to have us.”

“Oh,that will be fun！”

Then Becky reflected a moment and said：

“But what will mamma say?”

“How'll she ever know?”

The girl turned the idea over in her mind,and said reluctantly：

“I reckon it's wrong—but—”

“But shucks！Your mother won't know,and so what's the harm?All she wants is that you'll be safe；and I bet you she'd'a'said go there if she'd'a'thought of it.I know she would！”

The Widow Douglas'splendid hospitality was a tempting bait.It and Tom's persuasions presently carried the day.So it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night's programme.Presently it occurred to Tom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal.The thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations.Still he could not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas'.And why should he give it up,he reasoned—the signal did not come the night before,so why should it be any more likely to come tonight?The sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure；and,boylike,he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day.

Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up.The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter.All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gone through with,and by and by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites,and then the destruction of the good things began.After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks.By and by somebody shouted：

“Who's ready for the cave?”

Everybody was.Bundles of candles were procured,and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill.The mouth of the cave was up the hillside—an opening shaped like a letter A.Its massive oaken door stood unbarred.Within was a small chamber,chilly as an icehouse,and walled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun.But the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off,and the romping began again.The moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it；a struggle and a gallant defence followed,but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out,and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase.But all things have to end.By and by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue,the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead.This main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide.Every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand—for McDougal's cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere.It was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms,and never find the end of the cave；and that he might go down,and down,and still down,into the earth,and it was just the same—labyrinth underneath labyrinth,and no end to any of them.No man“knew”the cave.That was an impossible thing.Most of the young men knew a portion of it,and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.

The procession moved along the main avenue some three-quarters of a mile,and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues,fly along the dismal corridors,and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again.Parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the“known”ground.

By and by,one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave,panting,hilarious,smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings,daubed with clay,and entirely delighted with the success of the day.Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand.The clanging bell had been calling for half an hour.However,this sort of close to the day's adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory.When the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream,nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft.

Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboat's lights went glinting past the wharf.He heard no noise on board,for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death.He wondered what boat it was,and why she did not stop at the wharf—and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business.The night was growing cloudy and dark.Ten o'clock came,and the noise of vehicles ceased,scattered lights began to wink out,all straggling foot passengers disappeared,the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts.Eleven o'clock came,and the tavern lights were put out；darkness everywhere,now.Huck waited what seemed a weary long time,but nothing happened.His faith was weakening.Was there any use?Was there really any use?Why not give it up and turn in?

A noise fell upon his ear.He was all attention in an instant.The alley door closed softly.He sprang to the corner of the brick store.The next moment two men brushed by him,and one seemed to have something under his arm.It must be that box！So they were going to remove the treasure.Why call Tom now?It would be absurd—the men would get away with the box and never be found again.No,he would stick to their wake and follow them；he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery.So communing with himself,Huck stepped out and glided along behind the men,catlike,with bare feet,allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.

They moved up the river street three blocks,then turned to the left up a cross street.They went straight ahead,then,until they came to the path that led up Cardiff Hill；this they took.They passed by the old Welshman's house,half way up the hill,without hesitating,and still climbed upward.Good,thought Huck,they will bury it in the old quarry.But they never stopped at the quarry.They passed on,up the summit.They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes,and were at once hidden in the gloom.Huck closed up and shortened his distance,now,for they would never be able to see him.He trotted along awhile；then slackened his pace,fearing he was gaining too fast；moved on a piece,then stopped altogether；listened；no sound；none,save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart.The hooting of an owl came from over the hill—ominous sound！But no footsteps.Heavens,was everything lost！He was about to spring with winged feet,when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him！Huck's heart shot into his throat,but he swallowed it again；and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once,and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground.He knew where he was.He knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into Widow Douglas'grounds.Very well,he thought,let them bury it there；it won't be hard to find.

Now there was a voice—a very low voice—Injun Joe's：

“Damn her,maybe she's got company—there's lights,late as it is.”

“I can't see any.”

This was that stranger's voice—the stranger of the haunted house.A deadly chill went to Huck's heart—this,then,was the“revenge”job！His thought was to fly.Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas had been kind to him more than once,and maybe these men were going to murder her.He wished he dared venture to warn her；but he knew he didn't dare—they might come and catch him.He thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger's remark and Injun Joe's next—which was—

“Because the bush is in your way.Now—this way—now you see,don't you?”

“Yes.Well,there is company there,I reckon.Better give it up.”

“Give it up,and I just leaving this country forever！Give it up and maybe never have another chance.I tell you again,as I've told you before,I don't care for her swag—you may have it.But her husband was rough on me—many times he was rough on me—and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant.And that ain't all.It ain't a millionth part of it！He had me horsewhipped！—horsewhipped in front of the jail,like a nigger！—with all the town looking on！Horsewhipped！—do you understand?He took advantage of me and died.But I'll take it out on her.”

“Oh,don't kill her！Don't do that！”

“Kill?Who said anything about killing?I would kill him if he was here；but not her.When you want to get revenge on a woman you don't kill her—bosh！you go for her looks.You slit her nostrils—you notch her ears like a sow！”

“By God,that's—”

“Keep your opinion to yourself！It will be safest for you.I'll tie her to the bed.If she bleeds to death,is that my fault?I'll not cry,if she does.My friend,you'll help me in this thing—for my sake—that's why you're here—I mightn't be able alone.If you flinch,I'll kill you.Do you understand that?And if I have to kill you,I'll kill her—and then I reckon nobody'll ever know much about who done this business.”

“Well,if it's got to be done,let's get at it.The quicker the better—I'm all in a shiver.”

“Do it now?And company there?Look here—I'll get suspicious of you,first thing you know.No—we'll wait till the lights are out—there's no hurry.”

Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue—a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk；so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back；planted his foot carefully and firmly,after balancing,one-legged,in a precarious way and almost toppling over,first on one side and then on the other.He took another step back,with the same elaboration and the same risks；then another and another,and—a twig snapped under his foot！His breath stopped and he listened.There was no sound—the stillness was perfect.His gratitude was measureless.Now he turned in his tracks,between the walls of sumach bushes—turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship—and then stepped quickly but cautiously along.When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure,and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew.Down,down he sped,till he reached the Welshman's.He banged at the door,and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.

“What's the row there?Who's banging?What do you want?”

“Let me in—quick！I'll tell everything.”

“Why,who are you?”

“Huckleberry Finn—quick,let me in！”

“Huckleberry Finn,indeed！It ain't a name to open many doors,I judge！But let him in,lads,and let's see what's the trouble.”

“Please don't ever tell I told you，”were Huck's first words when he got in.“Please don't—I'd be killed,sure—but the widow's been good friends to me sometimes,and I want to tell—I will tell if you'll promise you won't ever say it was me.”

“By George,he has got something to tell,or he wouldn't act so！”exclaimed the old man.“out with it and nobody here'll ever tell,lad.”

Three minutes later the old man and his sons,well armed,were up the hill,and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe,their weapons in their hands.Huck accompanied them no further.He hid behind a great boulder and fell to listening.There was a lagging,anxious silence,and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.

Huck waited for no particulars.He sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅩ


As the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning,Huck came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshman's door.The inmates were asleep,but it was a sleep that was set on a hair trigger,on account of the exciting episode of the night.A call came from a window：

“Who's there！”

Huck's scared voice answered in a low tone：

“Please let me in！It's only Huck Finn！”

“It's a name that can open this door night or day,lad！—and welcome！”

These were strange words to the vagabond boy's ears,and the pleasantest he had ever heard.He could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before.The door was quickly unlocked,and he entered.Huck was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.

“Now,my boy,I hope you're good and hungry,because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun's up,and we'll have a piping hot one,too—make yourself easy about that！I and the boys hoped you'd turn up and stop here last night.”

“I was awful scared，”said Huck，“and I run.I took out when the pistols went off,and I didn't stop for three mile.I've come now becuz I wanted to know about it,you know；and I come before daylight becuz I didn't want to run across them devils,even if they was dead.”

“Well,poor chap,you do look as if you'd had a hard night of it—but there's a bed here for you when you've had your breakfast.No,they ain't dead,lad—we are sorry enough for that.You see we knew right where to put our hands on them,by your description；so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them—dark as a cellar that sumac path was—and just then I found I was going to sneeze.It was the meanest kind of luck！I tried to keep it back,but no use—'twas bound to come,and it did come！I was in the lead with my pistol raised,and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a-rustling to get out of the path,I sung out，‘Fire,boys！’and blazed away at the place where the rustling was.So did the boys.But they were off in a jiffy,those villains,and we after them,down through the woods.I judge we never touched them.They fired a shot apiece as they started,but their bullets whizzed by and didn't do us any harm.As soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing,and went down and stirred up the constables.They got a posse together,and went off to guard the riverbank,and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods.My boys will be with them presently.I wish we had some sort of description of those rascals—'twould help a good deal.But you couldn't see what they were like,in the dark,lad,I suppose?”

“Oh yes；I saw them downtown and follered them.”

“Splendid！Describe them—describe them,my boy！”

“One's the old deaf-and-dumb Spaniard that's ben around here once or twice,and t'other's a mean-looking,ragged—”

“That's enough,lad,we know the men！Happened on them in the woods back of the widow's one day,and they slunk away.Off with you,boys,and tell the sheriff—get your breakfast tomorrow morning！”

The Welshman's sons departed at once.As they were leaving the room Huck sprang up and exclaimed：

“Oh,please don't tell any body it was me that blowed on them！Oh,please！”

“All right if you say it,Huck,but you ought to have the credit of what you did.”

“Oh no,no！Please don't tell！”

When the young men were gone,the old Welshman said：

“They won't tell—and I won't.But why don't you want it known?”

Huck would not explain,further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world—he would be killed for knowing it,sure.

The old man promised secrecy once more,and said：

“How did you come to follow these fellows,lad?Were they looking suspicious?”

Huck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply.Then he said：

“Well,you see,I'm a kind of a hard lot—least everybody says so,and I don't see nothing agin it—and sometimes I can't sleep much,on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing.That was the way of it last night.I couldn't sleep,and so I come along upstreet'bout midnight,a-turning it all over,and when I got to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern,I backed up agin the wall to have another think.Well,just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me,with something under their arm and I reckoned they'd stole it.One was a-smoking,and t'other one wanted a light；so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces and I see that the big one was the deaf-and-dumb Spaniard,by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye,and t'other one was a rusty,ragged-looking devil.”

“Could you see the rags by the light of the cigars?”

This staggered Huck for a moment.Then he said：

“Well,I don't know—but somehow it seems as if I did.”

“Then they went on,and you—”

“Follered'em—yes.That was it.I wanted to see what was up—they sneaked along so.I dogged'em to the widder's stile,and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder,and the Spaniard swear he'd spile her looks just as I told you and your two—”

“What！The deaf-and-dumb man said all that！”

Huck had made another terrible mistake！He was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard might be,and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do.He made several efforts to creep out of his scrape,but the old man's eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder.Presently the Welshman said：

“My boy,don't be afraid of me.I wouldn't hurt a hair of your head for all the world.No—I'd protect you—I'd protect you.This Spaniard is not deaf and dumb；you've let that slip without intending it；you can't cover that up now.You know something about that Spaniard that you want to keep dark.Now trust me—tell me what it is,and trust me—I won't betray you.”

Huck looked into the old man's honest eyes a moment,then bent over and whispered in his ear：

“'Tain't a Spaniard—it's Injun Joe！”

The Welshman almost jumped out of his chair.In a moment he said：

“It's all plain enough,now.When you talked about notching ears and slitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment,because white men don't take that sort of revenge.But an Injun！That's a different matter altogether.”

During breakfast the talk went on,and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done,before going to bed,was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood.They found none,but captured a bulky bundle of—

“Of what?”

If the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from Huck's blanched lips.His eyes were staring wide,now,and his breath suspended—waiting for the answer.The Welshman started—stared in return—three seconds—five seconds—ten—then replied：

“Of burglar's tools.Why,what's the matter with you?”

Huck sank back,panting gently,but deeply,unutterably grateful.The Welshman eyed him gravely,curiously—and presently said：

“Yes,burglar's tools.That appears to relieve you a good deal.But what did give you that turn?What were you expecting we'd found?”

Huck was in a close place—the inquiring eye was upon him—he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer—nothing suggested itself—the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper—a senseless reply offered—there was no time to weigh it,so at a venture he uttered it—feebly：

“Sunday-school books,maybe.”

Poor Huck was too distressed to smile,but the old man laughed loudly and joyously,shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot,and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a man's pocket,because it cut down the doctor's bill like everything.Then he added：

“Poor old chap,you're white and jaded—you ain't well a bit—no wonder you're a little flighty and off your balance.But you'll come out of it.Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right,I hope.”

Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement,for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure,as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow's stile.He had only thought it was not the treasure,however—he had not known that it wasn't—and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self-possession.But on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened,for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not the bundle,and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable.In fact,everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction,now；the treasure must be still in No.2，the men would be captured and jailed that day,and he and Tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption.

Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door.Huck jumped for a hiding place,for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event.The Welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen,among them the Widow Douglas,and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill—to stare at the stile.So the news had spread.

The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors.The widow's gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.

“Don't say a word about it,madam.There's another that you're more beholden to than you are to me and my boys,maybe,but he don't allow me to tell his name.We wouldn't have been there but for him.”

Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter—but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors,and through them be transmitted to the whole town,for he refused to part with his secret.When all else had been learned,the widow said：

“I went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise.Why didn't you come and wake me?”

“We judged it warn't worth while.Those fellows warn't likely to come again—they hadn't any tools left to work with,and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death?My three Negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night.They've just come back.”

More visitors came,and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more.

There was no Sabbath school during day-school vacation,but everybody was early at church.The stirring event was well canvassed.News came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered.When the sermon was finished,Judge Thatcher's wife dropped alongside of Mrs.Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said：

“Is my Becky going to sleep all day?I just expected she would be tired to death.”

“Your Becky?”

“Yes，”with a startled look—“didn't she stay with you last night?”

“Why,no.”

Mrs.Thatcher turned pale,and sank into a pew,just as Aunt Polly,talking briskly with a friend,passed by.Aunt Polly said：

“Good morning,Mrs.Thatcher.Good morning,Mrs.Harper.I've got a boy that's turned up missing.I reckon my Tom stayed at your house last night—one of you.And now he's afraid to come to church.I've got to settle with him.”

Mrs.Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.

“He didn't stay with us，”said Mrs.Harper,beginning to look uneasy.A marked anxiety came into Aunt Polly's face.

“Joe Harper,have you seen my Tom this morning?”

“No'm.”

“When did you see him last?”

Joe tried to remember,but was not sure he could say.The people had stopped moving out of church.Whispers passed along,and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance.Children were anxiously questioned,and young teachers.They all said they had not noticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip；it was dark；no one thought of inquiring if anyone was missing.One young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave！Mrs.Thatcher swooned away.Aunt Polly fell to crying and wringing her hands.

The alarm swept from lip to lip,from group to group,from street to street,and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up！The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instant insignificance,the burglars were forgotten,horses were saddled,skiffs were manned,the ferryboat ordered out,and before the horror was half an hour old,two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave.

All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead.Many women visited Aunt Polly and Mrs.Thatcher and tried to comfort them.They cried with them,too,and that was still better than words.All the tedious night the town waited for news；but when the morning dawned at last,all the word that came was，“Send more candles—and send food.”Mrs.Thatcher was almost crazed；and Aunt Polly,also.Judge Thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave,but they conveyed no real cheer.

The old Welshman came home toward daylight,spattered with candle grease,smeared with clay,and almost worn out.He found Huck still in the bed that had been provided for him,and delirious with fever.The physicians were all at the cave,so the Widow Douglas came and took charge of the patient.She said she would do her best by him,because,whether he was good,bad,or indifferent,he was the Lord's,and nothing that was the Lord's was a thing to be neglected.The Welshman said Huck had good spots in him,and the widow said：

“You can depend on it.That's the Lord's mark.He don't leave it off.He never does.Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands.”

Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village,but the strongest of the citizens continued searching.All the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before；that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched；that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages,lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance,and shoutings and pistol shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles.In one place,far from the section usually traversed by tourists,the names“BECKY＆TOM”had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle smoke,and near at hand a grease-soiled bit of ribbon.Mrs.Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it.She said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child；and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious,because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came.Some said that now and then,in the cave,a faraway speck of light would glimmer,and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle—and then a sickening disappointment always followed；the children were not there；it was only a searcher's light.

Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along,and the village sank into a hopeless stupor.No one had heart for anything.The accidental discovery,just made,that the proprietor of the Temperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises,scarcely fluttered the public pulse,tremendous as the fact was.In a lucid interval,Huck feebly led up to the subject of taverns,and finally asked—dimly dreading the worst—if anything had been discovered at the Temperance Tavern since he had been ill.

“Yes，”said the widow.

Huck started up in bed,wild-eyed：

“What?What was it?”

“Liquor！—and the place has been shut up.Lie down,child—what a turn you did give me！”

“Only tell me just one thing—only just one—please！Was it Tom Sawyer that found it?”

The widow burst into tears.“Hush,hush,child,hush！I've told you before,you must not talk.You are very,very sick！”

Then nothing but liquor had been found；there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold.So the treasure was gone forever—gone forever！But what could she be crying about?Curious that she should cry.

These thoughts worked their dim way through Huck's mind,and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep.The widow said to herself：

“There—he's asleep,poor wreck.Tom Sawyer find it！Pity but somebody could find Tom Sawyer！Ah,there ain't many left,now,that's got hope enough,or strength enough,either,to go on searching.”





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅪ


Now to return to Tom and Becky's share in the picnic.They tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company,visiting the familiar wonders of the cave—wonders dubbed with rather overdescriptive names,such as“The Drawing Room，”“The Cathedral，”“Aladdin's Palace，”and so on.Presently the hide-and-seek frolicking began,and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome；then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names,dates,post-office addresses,and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed（in candle smoke）.Still drifting along and talking,they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed.They smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on.Presently they came to a place where a little stream of water,trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it,had,in the slow-dragging ages,formed a laced and ruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone.Tom squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for Becky's gratification.He found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls,and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him.Becky responded to his call,and they made a smoke mark for future guidance,and started upon their quest.They wound this way and that,far down into the secret depths of the cave,made another mark,and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about.In one place they found a spacious cavern,from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man's leg；they walked all about it,wondering and admiring,and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it.This shortly brought them to a bewitching spring,whose basin was encrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals；it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together,the result of the ceaseless water-drip of centuries.Under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together,thousands in a bunch；the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds,squeaking and darting furiously at the candles.Tom knew their ways and the danger of this sort of conduct.He seized Becky's hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered；and none too soon,for a bat struck Becky's light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern.The bats chased the children a good distance；but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered,and at last got rid of the perilous things.Tom found a subterranean lake,shortly,which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows.He wanted to explore its borders,but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile,first.Now,for the first time,the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children.Becky said：

“Why,I didn't notice,but it seems ever so long since I heard any of the others.”

“Come to think,Becky,we are away down below them—and I don't know how far away north,or south,or east,or whichever it is.We couldn't hear them here.”

Becky grew apprehensive.

“I wonder how long we've been down here,Tom.We better start back.”

“Yes,I reckon we better.P'raps we better.”

“Can you find the way,Tom?It's all a mixed-up crookedness to me.”

“I reckon I could find it—but then the bats.If they put both our candles out it will be an awful fix.Let's try some other way,so as not to go through there.”

“Well.But I hope we won't get lost.It would be so awful！”and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.

They started through a corridor,and traversed it in silence a long way,glancing at each new opening,to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it；but they were all strange.Every time Tom made an examination,Becky would watch his face for an encouraging sign,and he would say cheerily：

“Oh,it's all right.This ain't the one,but we'll come to it right away！”

But he felt less and less hopeful with each failure,and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random,in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted.He still said it was“all right，”but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said，“All is lost！”Becky clung to his side in an anguish of fear,and tried hard to keep back the tears,but they would come.At last she said：

“Oh,Tom,never mind the bats,let's go back that way！We seem to get worse and worse off all the time.”

Tom stopped.

“Listen！”said he.

Profound silence；silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush.Tom shouted.The call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter.

“Oh,don't do it again,Tom,it is too horrid，”said Becky.

“It is horrid,but I better,Becky；they might hear us,you know，”and he shouted again.

The“might”was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter,it so confessed a perishing hope.The children stood still and listened；but there was no result.Tom turned upon the back track at once,and hurried his steps.It was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky—he could not find his way back！

“Oh,Tom,you didn't make any marks！”

“Becky,I was such a fool！Such a fool！I never thought we might want to come back！No—I can't find the way.It's all mixed up.”

“Tom,Tom,we're lost！we're lost！We never can get out of this awful place！Oh,why did we ever leave the others！”

She sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tom was appalled with the idea that she might die,or lose her reason.He sat down by her and put his arms around her；she buried her face in his bosom,she clung to him,she poured out her terrors,her unavailing regrets,and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter.Tom begged her to pluck up hope again,and she said she could not.He fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation；this had a better effect.She said she would try to hope again,she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more.For he was no more to blame than she,she said.

So they moved on,again—aimlessly—simply at random—all they could do was to move,keep moving.For a little while,hope made a show of reviving—not with any reason to back it,but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure.

By and by Tom took Becky's candle and blew it out.This economy meant so much！Words were not needed.Becky understood,and her hope died again.She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets—yet he must economize.

By and by,fatigue began to assert its claims；the children tried to pay no attention,for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious,moving,in some direction,in any direction,was at least progress and might bear fruit；but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit.

At last Becky's frail limbs refused to carry her farther.She sat down.Tom rested with her,and they talked of home,and the friends there,and the comfortable beds and,above all,the light！Becky cried,and Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her,but all his encouragements were grown threadbare with use,and sounded like sarcasms.Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off to sleep.Tom was grateful.He sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams；and by and by a smile dawned and rested there.The peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit,and his thoughts wandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories.While he was deep in his musings,Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh—but it was stricken dead upon her lips,and a groan followed it.

“Oh,how could I sleep！I wish I never,never had waked！No！No,I don't,Tom！Don't look so！I won't say it again.”

“I'm glad you've slept,Becky；you'll feel rested,now,and we'll find the way out.”

“We can try,Tom；but I've seen such a beautiful country in my dream.I reckon we are going there.”

“Maybe not,maybe not.Cheer up,Becky,and let's go on trying.”

They rose up and wandered along,hand in hand and hopeless.They tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave,but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks,and yet it was plain that this could not be,for their candles were not gone yet.A long time after this—they could not tell how long—Tom said they must go softly and listen for dripping water—they must find a spring.They found one presently,and Tom said it was time to rest again.Both were cruelly tired,yet Becky said she thought she could go on a little farther.She was surprised to hear Tom dissent.She could not understand it.They sat down,and Tom fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay.Thought was soon busy；nothing was said for some time.Then Becky broke the silence：

“Tom,I am so hungry！”

Tom took something out of his pocket.

“Do you remember this?”said he.

Becky almost smiled.

“It's our wedding cake,Tom.”

“Yes—I wish it was as big as a barrel,for it's all we've got.”

“I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on,Tom,the way grown-up people do with wedding cake—but it'll be our—”

She dropped the sentence where it was.Tom divided the cake and Becky ate with good appetite,while Tom nibbled at his moiety.There was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with.By and by Becky suggested that they move on again.Tom was silent a moment.Then he said：

“Becky,can you bear it if I tell you something?”

Becky's face paled,but she thought she could.

“Well,then,Becky,we must stay here,where there's water to drink.That little piece is our last candle！”

Becky gave loose to tears and wailings.Tom did what he could to comfort her,but with little effect.At length Becky said：

“Tom！”

“Well,Becky?”

“They'll miss us and hunt for us！”

“Yes,they will！Certainly they will！”

“Maybe they're hunting for us now,Tom.”

“Why,I reckon maybe they are.I hope they are.”

“When would they miss us,Tom?”

“When they get back to the boat,I reckon.”

“Tom,it might be dark then—would they notice we hadn't come?”

“I don't know.But anyway,your mother would miss you as soon as they got home.”

A frightened look in Becky's face brought Tom to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder.Becky was not to have gone home that night！The children became silent and thoughtful.In a moment a new burst of grief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hers also—that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs.Thatcher discovered that Becky was not at Mrs.Harper's.

The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away；saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last；saw the feeble flame rise and fall,climb the thin column of smoke,linger at its top a moment,and then—the horror of utter darkness reigned！

How long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in Tom's arms,neither could tell.All that they knew was,that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time,both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more.Tom said it might be Sunday,now—maybe Monday.He tried to get Becky to talk,but her sorrows were too oppressive,all her hopes were gone.Tom said that they must have been missed long ago,and no doubt the search was going on.He would shout and maybe someone would come.He tried it；but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more.

The hours wasted away,and hunger came to torment the captives again.A portion of Tom's half of the cake was left；they divided and ate it.But they seemed hungrier than before.The poor morsel of food only whetted desire.

By and by Tom said：

“Sh！Did you hear that?”

Both held their breath and listened.There was a sound like the faintest,far-off shout.Instantly Tom answered it,and leading Becky by the hand,started groping down the corridor in its direction.Presently he listened again；again the sound was heard,and apparently a little nearer.

“It's them！”said Tom；“they're coming！Come along,Becky—we're all right now！”

The joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming.Their speed was slow,however,because pitfalls were somewhat common,and had to be guarded against.They shortly came to one and had to stop.It might be three feet deep,it might be a hundred—there was no passing it at any rate.Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could.No bottom.They must stay there and wait until the searchers came.They listened；evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant！a moment or two more and they had gone altogether.The heart-sinking misery of it！Tom whooped until he was hoarse,but it was of no use.He talked hopefully to Becky；but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again.

The children groped their way back to the spring.The weary time dragged on；they slept again,and awoke famished and woe-stricken.Tom believed it must be Tuesday by this time.

Now an idea struck him.There were some side passages near at hand.It would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness.He took a kite line from his pocket,tied it to a projection,and he and Becky started,Tom in the lead,unwinding the line as he groped along.At the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a“jumping-off place.”Tom got down on his knees and felt below,and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently；he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right,and at that moment,not twenty yards away,a human hand,holding a candle,appeared from behind a rock！Tom lifted up a glorious shout,and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to—Injun Joe's！Tom was paralyzed；he could not move.He was vastly gratified the next moment,to see the“Spaniard”take to his heels and get himself out of sight.Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court.But the echoes must have disguised the voice.Without doubt,that was it,he reasoned.Tom's fright weakened every muscle in his body.He said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there,and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting Injun Joe again.He was careful to keep from Becky what it was he had seen.He told her he had only shouted“for luck.”

But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes.The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger.Tom believed that it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday,now,and that the search had been given over.He proposed to explore another passage.He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors.But Becky was very weak.She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused.She said she would wait,now,where she was,and die—it would not be long.She told Tom to go with the kite line and explore if he chose；but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her；and she made him promise that when the awful time came,he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.

Tom kissed her,with a choking sensation in his throat,and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave；then he took the kite line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees,distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅫ


Tuesday afternoon came,and waned to the twilight.The village of St.Petersburg still mourned.The lost children had not been found.Public prayers had been offered up for them,and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it；but still no good news came from the cave.The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations,saying that it was plain the children could never be found.Mrs.Thatcher was very ill,and a great part of the time delirious.People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child,and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,then lay it wearily down again with a moan.Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy,and her gray hair had grown almost white.The village went to its rest on Tuesday night,sad and forlorn.

Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells,and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad people,who shouted，“Turn out！turn out！they're found！they're found！”Tin pans and horns were added to the din,the population massed itself and moved toward the river,met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens,thronged around it,joined its homeward march,and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah！

The village was illuminated；nobody went to bed again；it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen.During the first half hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house,seized the saved ones and kissed them,squeezed Mrs.Thatcher's hand,tried to speak but couldn't—and drifted out raining tears all over the place.

Aunt Polly's happiness was complete,and Mrs.Thatcher's nearly so.It would be complete,however,as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband.Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure,putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal；and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition；how he followed two avenues as far as his kite line would reach；how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite line,and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight；dropped the line and groped toward it,pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole,and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by！And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more！He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff,for she was tired,and knew she was going to die,and wanted to.He described how he labored with her and convinced her；and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight；how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out；how they sat there and cried for gladness；how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition；how the men didn't believe the wild tale at first，“because，”said they，“you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in”—then took them aboard,rowed to a house,gave them supper,made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.

Before day dawn,Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out,in the cave,by the twine clews they had strung behind them,and informed of the great news.

Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once,as Tom and Becky soon discovered.They were bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday,and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn,all the time.Tom got about,a little,on Thursday,was downtown Friday,and nearly as whole as ever Saturday；but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday,and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.

Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday,but could not be admitted to the bedroom；neither could he on Saturday or Sunday.He was admitted daily after that,but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic.The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed.At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event；also that the“ragged man's”body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry landing；he had been drowned while trying to escape,perhaps.

About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave,he started off to visit Huck,who had grown plenty strong enough,now,to hear exciting talk,and Tom had some that would interest him,he thought.Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's way,and he stopped to see Becky.The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking,and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again.Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it.The Judge said：

“Well,there are others just like you,Tom,I've not the least doubt.But we have taken care of that.Nobody will get lost in that cave any more.”

“Why?”

“Because I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago,and triple-locked—and I've got the keys.”

Tom turned as white as a sheet.

“What's the matter,boy！Here,run,somebody！Fetch a glass of water！”

The water was brought and thrown into Tom's face.

“Ah,now you're all right.What was the matter with you,Tom?”

“Oh,Judge,Injun Joe's in the cave！”





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅩⅢ


Within a few minutes the news had spread,and a dozen skiff-loads of men were on their way to McDougal's cave,and the ferryboat,well filled with passengers,soon followed.Tom Sawyer was in the skiff that bore Judge Thatcher.

When the cave door was unlocked,a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place.Injun Joe lay stretched upon the ground,dead,with his face close to the crack of the door,as if his longing eyes had been fixed,to the latest moment,upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside.Tom was touched,for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered.His pity was moved,but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security,now,which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody-minded outcast.

Injun Joe's bowie knife lay close by,its blade broken in two.The great foundation beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through,with tedious labor；useless labor,too,it was,for the native rock formed a sill outside it,and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect；the only damage done was to the knife itself.But if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still,for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe could not have squeezed his body under the door,and he knew it.So he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something—in order to pass the weary time—in order to employ his tortured faculties.Ordinarily one could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule,left there by tourists；but there were none now.The prisoner had searched them out and eaten them.He had also contrived to catch a few bats,and these,also,he had eaten,leaving only their claws.The poor unfortunate had starved to death.In one place,near at hand,a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages,builded by the water-drip from a stalactite overhead.The captive had broken off the stalagmite,and upon the stump had placed a stone,wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once every three minutes with the dreary regularity of a clock tick—a dessert spoonful once in four and twenty hours.That drop was falling when the Pyramids were new；when Troy fell；when the foundations of Rome were laid；when Christ was crucified；when the Conqueror created the British empire；when Columbus sailed；when the massacre at Lexington was“news.”It is falling now；it will still be falling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon of history,and the twilight of tradition,and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion.Has everything a purpose and a mission?Did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect's need?and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come?No matter.It is many and many a year since the hapless half-breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops,but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow-dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of McDougal's cave.Injun Joe's cup stands first in the list of the cavern's marvels；even“Aladdin's Palace”cannot rival it.

Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave；and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around；they brought their children,and all sorts of provisions,and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging.

This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing—the petition to the Governor for Injun Joe's pardon.The petition had been largely signed；many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held,and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor,and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot.Injun Joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the village,but what of that?If he had been Satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon petition,and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky waterworks.

The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to have an important talk.Huck had learned all about Tom's adventure from the Welshman and the Widow Douglas,by this time,but Tom said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him；that thing was what he wanted to talk about now.Huck's face saddened.He said：

“I know what it is.You got into No.2 and never found anything but whiskey.Nobody told me it was you；but I just knowed it must'a'been you,soon as I heard'bout that whiskey business；and I knowed you hadn't got the money becuz you'd a got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else.Tom,something's always told me we'd never get holt of that swag.”

“Why,Huck,I never told on that tavernkeeper.You know his tavern was all right the Saturday I went to the picnic.Don't you remember you was to watch there that night?”

“Oh yes！Why,it seems'bout a year ago.It was that very night that I follered Injun Joe to the widder's.”

“You followed him?”

“Yes—but you keep mum.I reckon Injun Joe's left friends behind him,and I don't want'em souring on me and doing me mean tricks.If it hadn't ben for me he'd be down in Texas now,all right.”

Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom,who had only heard of the Welshman's part of it before.

“Well，”said Huck,presently,coming back to the main question，“whoever nipped the whisky in No.2，nipped the money,too,I reckon—anyways it's a goner for us,Tom.”

“Huck,that money wasn't ever in No.2！”

“What！”Huck searched his comrade's face keenly.“Tom,have you got on the track of that money again?”

“Huck,it's in the cave！”

Huck's eyes blazed.

“Say it again,Tom.”

“The money's in the cave！”

“Tom—honest injun,now—is it fun,or earnest?”

“Earnest,Huck—just as earnest as ever I was in my life.Will you go in there with me and help get it out?”

“I bet I will！I will if it's where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost.”

“Huck,we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world.”

“Good as wheat！What makes you think the money's—”

“Huck,you just wait till we get in there.If we don't find it I'll agree to give you my drum and everything I've got in the world.I will,by jings.”

“All right—it's a whiz.When do you say?”

“Right now,if you say it.Are you strong enough?”

“Is it far in the cave?I ben on my pins a little,three or four days,now,but I can't walk more'n a mile,Tom—least I don't think I could.”

“It's about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go,Huck,but there's a mighty short cut that they don't anybody but me know about.Huck,I'll take you right to it in a skiff.I'll float the skiff down there,and I'll pull it back again all by myself.You needn't ever turn your hand over.”

“Less start right off,Tom.”

“All right.We want some bread and meat,and our pipes,and a little bag or two,and two or three kite strings,and some of these newfangled things they call lucifer matches.I tell you,many's the time I wished I had some when I was in there before.”

A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent,and got under way at once.When they were several miles below“Cave Hollow，”Tom said：

“Now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow—no houses,no woodyards,bushes all alike.But do you see that white place up yonder where there's been a landslide?Well,that's one of my marks.We'll get ashore,now.”

They landed.

“Now,Huck,where we're a-standing you could touch that hole I got out of with a fishing pole.See if you can find it.”

Huck searched all the place about,and found nothing.Tom proudly marched into a thick clump of sumac bushes and said：

“Here you are！Look at it,Huck；it's the snuggest hole in this country.You just keep mum about it.All along I've been wanting to be a robber,but I knew I'd got to have a thing like this,and where to run across it was the bother.We've got it now,and we'll keep it quiet,only we'll let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in—because of course there's got to be a Gang,or else there wouldn't be any style about it.Tom Sawyer's Gang—it sounds splendid,don't it,Huck?”

“Well,it just does,Tom.And who'll we rob?”

“Oh,most anybody.Waylay people—that's mostly the way.”

“And kill them?”

“No,not always.Hide them in the cave till they raise a ransom.”

“What's a ransom?”

“Money.You make them raise all they can,off'n their friends；and after you've kept them a year,if it ain't raised then you kill them.That's the general way.Only you don't kill the women.You shut up the women,but you don't kill them.They're always beautiful and rich,and awfully scared.You take their watches and things,but you always take your hat off and talk polite.They ain't anybody as polite as robbers—you'll see that in any book.Well,the women get to loving you,and after they've been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldn't get them to leave.If you drove them out they'd turn right around and come back.It's so in all the books.”

“Why,it's real bully,Tom.I believe it's better'n to be a pirate.”

“Yes,it's better in some ways,because it's close to home and circuses and all that.”

By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole,Tom in the lead.They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel,then made their spliced kite strings fast and moved on.A few steps brought them to the spring,and Tom felt a shudder quiver all through him.He showed Huck the fragment of candle wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall,and described how he and Becky had watched the flame struggle and expire.

The boys began to quiet down to whispers,now,for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits.They went on,and presently entered and followed Tom's other corridor until they reached the“jumping-off place.”The candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice,but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high.Tom whispered：

“Now I'll show you something,Huck.”

He held his candle aloft and said：

“Look as far around the corner as you can.Do you see that?There—on the big rock over yonder—done with candle smoke.”

“Tom,it's a cross！”

“Now where's your Number Two?‘Under the cross，'hey?Right yonder's where I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle,Huck！”

Huck stared at the mystic sign awhile,and then said with a shaky voice：

“Tom,less git out of here！”

“What！and leave the treasure?”

“Yes—leave it.Injun Joe's ghost is round about there,certain.”

“No it ain't,Huck,no it ain't.It would ha'nt the place where he died—away out at the mouth of the cave—five mile from here.”

“No,Tom,it wouldn't.It would hang round the money.I know the ways of ghosts,and so do you.”

Tom began to fear that Huck was right.Misgivings gathered in his mind.But presently an idea occurred to him—

“Looky-here,Huck,what fools we're making of ourselves！Injun Joe's ghost ain't a-going to come around where there's a cross！”

The point was well taken.It had its effect.

“Tom,I didn't think of that.But that's so.It's luck for us,that cross is.I reckon we'll climb down there and have a hunt for that box.”

Tom went first,cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.Huck followed.Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in.The boys examined three of them with no result.They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock,with a pallet of blankets spread down in it；also an old suspender,some bacon rind,and the well-gnawed bones of two or three fowls.But there was no money box.The lads searched and re-searched this place,but in vain.Tom said：

“He said under the cross.Well,this comes nearest to being under the cross.It can't be under the rock itself,because that sets solid on the ground.”

They searched everywhere once more,and then sat down discouraged.Huck could suggest nothing.By and by Tom said：

“Looky-here,Huck,there's footprints and some candle grease on the clay about one side of this rock,but not on the other sides.Now,what's that for?I bet you the money is under the rock.I'm going to dig in the clay.”

“That ain't no bad notion,Tom！”said Huck with animation.

Tom's“real Barlow”was out at once,and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood.

“Hey,Huck！—you hear that?”

Huck began to dig and scratch now.Some boards were soon uncovered and removed.They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could,but said he could not see to the end of the rift.He proposed to explore.He stooped and passed under；the narrow way descended gradually.He followed its winding course,first to the right,then to the left,Huck at his heels.Tom turned a short curve,by and by,and exclaimed：

“My goodness,Huck,looky-here！”

It was the treasure box,sure enough,occupying a snug little cavern,along with an empty powder keg,a couple of guns in leather cases,two or three pairs of old moccasins,a leather belt,and some other rubbish well soaked with the water-drip.

“Got it at last！”said Huck,plwing among the tarnished coins with his hand.“My,but we're rich,Tom！”

“Huck,I always reckoned we'd get it.It's just too good to believe,but we have got it,sure！Say—let's not fool around here.Let's snake it out.Lemme see if I can lift the box.”

It weighed about fifty pounds.Tom could lift it,after an awkward fashion,but could not carry it conveniently.

“I thought so，”he said；“They carried it like it was heavy,that day at the ha'nted house.I noticed that.I reckon I was right to think of fetching the little bags along.”

The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the cross rock.

“Now less fetch the guns and things，”said Huck.

“No,Huck—leave them there.They're just the tricks to have when we go to robbing.We'll keep them there all the time,and we'll hold our orgies there,too.It's an awful snug place for orgies.”

“What orgies?”

“I dono.But robbers always have orgies,and of course we've got to have them,too.Come along,Huck,we've been in here a long time.It's getting late,I reckon.I'm hungry,too.We'll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff.”

They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes,looked warily out,found the coast clear,and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff.As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way.Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight,chatting cheerily with Huck,and landed shortly after dark.

“Now,Huck，”said Tom，“we'll hide the money in the loft of the widow's woodshed,and I'll come up in the morning and we'll count it and divide,and then we'll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe.Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till I run and hook Benny Taylor's little wagon；I won't be gone a minute.”

He disappeared,and presently returned with the wagon,put the two small sacks into it,threw some old rags on top of them,and started off,dragging his cargo behind him.When the boys reached the Welshman's house,they stopped to rest.Just as they were about to move on,the Welshman stepped out and said：

“Hallo,who's that?”

“Huck and Tom Sawyer.”

“Good！Come along with me,boys,you are keeping everybody waiting.Here—hurry up,trot ahead—I'll haul the wagon for you.Why,it's not as light as it might be.Got bricks in it?—or old metal?”

“Old metal，”said Tom.

“I judged so；the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time,hunting up six bits'worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work.But that's human nature—hurry along,hurry along！”

The boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.

“Never mind；you'll see,when we get to the Widow Douglas'.”

Huck said with some apprehension—for he was long used to being falsely accused：

“Mr.Jones,we haven't been doing nothing.”

The Welshman laughed.

“Well,I don't know,Huck,my boy.I don't know about that.Ain't you and the widow good friends?”

“Yes.Well,she's ben good friends to me,anyway.”

“All right,then.What do you want to be afraid for?”

This question was not entirely answered in Huck's slow mind before he found himself pushed,along with Tom,into Mrs.Douglas'drawing room.Mr.Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.

The place was grandly lighted,and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there.The Thatchers were there,the Harpers,the Rogerses,Aunt Polly,Sid,Mary,the minister,the editor,and a great many more,and all dressed in their best.The widow received the boys as heartily as anyone could well receive two such looking beings.They were covered with clay and candle grease.Aunt Polly blushed crimson with humiliation,and frowned and shook her head at Tom.Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did,however.Mr.Jones said：

“Tom wasn't at home,yet,so I gave him up；but I stumbled on him and Huck right at my door,and so I just brought them along in a hurry.”

“And you did just right，”said the widow.“Come with me,boys.”

She took them to a bedchamber and said：

“Now wash and dress yourselves.Here are two new suits of clothes—shirts,socks,everything complete.They're Huck's—no,no thanks,Huck—Mr.Jones bought one and I the other.But they'll fit both of you.Get into them.We'll wait—come down when you are slicked up enough.”

Then she left.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅩⅣ


Huck said：“Tom,we can slope,if we can find a rope.The window ain't high from the ground.”

“Shucks！what do you want to slope for?”

“Well,I ain't used to that kind of a crowd.I can't stand it.I ain't going down there,Tom.”

“Oh,bother！It ain't anything.I don't mind it a bit.I'll take care of you.”

Sid appeared.

“Tom，”said he，“Auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.Mary got your Sunday clothes ready,and everybody's been fretting about you.Say—ain't this grease and clay,on your clothes?”

“Now,Mr.Siddy,you jist'tend to your own business.What's all this blowout about,anyway?”

“It's one of the widow's parties that she's always having.This time it's for the Welshman and his sons,on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night.And say—I can tell you something,if you want to know.”

“Well,what?”

“Why,old Mr.Jones is going to try to spring something on the people here tonight,but I overheard him tell auntie today about it,as a secret,but I reckon it's not much of a secret now.Everybody knows—the widow,too,for all she tries to let on she don't.Mr.Jones was bound Huck should be here—couldn't get along with his grand secret without Huck,you know！”

“Secret about what,Sid?”

“About Huck tracking the robbers to the widow's.I reckon Mr.Jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise,but I bet you it will drop pretty flat.”

Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.

“Sid,was it you that told?”

“Oh,never mind who it was.Somebody told—that's enough.”

“Sid,there's only one person in this town mean enough to do that,and that's you.If you had been in Huck's place you'd'a'sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers.You can't do any but mean things,and you can't bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.There—no thanks,as the widow says”—and Tom cuffed Sid's ears and helped him to the door with several kicks.“Now go and tell auntie if you dare—and tomorrow you'll catch it！”

Some minutes later the widow's guests were at the supper table,and a dozen children were propped up at little side tables in the same room,after the fashion of that country and that day.At the proper time Mr.Jones made his little speech,in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons,but said that there was another person whose modesty—

And so forth and so on.He sprung his secret about Huck's share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of,but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances.However,the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment,and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody's gaze and everybody's laudations.

The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and have him educated；and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way.Tom's chance was come.He said：

“Huck don't need it.Huck's rich.”

Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke.But the silence was a little awkward.Tom broke it：

“Huck's got money.Maybe you don't believe it,but he's got lots of it.Oh,you needn't smile—I reckon I can show you.You just wait a minute.”

Tom ran out of doors.The company looked at each other with a perplexed interest—and inquiringly at Huck,who was tongue-tied.

“Sid,what ails Tom?”said Aunt Polly.“He—well,there ain't ever any making of that boy out.I never—”

Tom entered,struggling with the weight of his sacks,and Aunt Polly did not finish her sentence.Tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said：

“There—what did I tell you?Half of it's Huck's and half of it's mine！”

The spectacle took the general breath away.All gazed,nobody spoke for a moment.Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation.Tom said he could furnish it,and he did.The tale was long,but brimful of interest.There was scarcely an interruption from anyone to break the charm of its flow.When he had finished,Mr.Jones said：

“I thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion,but it don't amount to anything now.This one makes it seem mighty small,I'm willing to allow.”

The money was counted.The sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars.It was more than anyone present had ever seen at one time before,though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property.





CHAPTER ⅩⅩⅩⅤ


The reader may rest satisfied that Tom's and Huck's windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of St.Petersburg.So vast a sum,all in actual cash,seemed next to incredible.It was talked about,gloated over,glorified,until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement.Every“haunted”house in St.Petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected,plank by plank,and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure—and not by boys,but men—pretty grave,unromantic men,too,some of them.Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they were courted,admired,stared at.The boys were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before；but now their sayings were treasured and repeated；everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable；they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace things；moreover,their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality.The village paper published biographical sketches of the boys.

The Widow Douglas put Huck's money out at six per cent.，and Judge Thatcher did the same with Tom's at Aunt Polly's request.Each lad had an income,now,that was simply prodigious—a dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the Sundays.It was just what the minister got—no,it was what he was promised—he generally couldn't collect it.A dollar and a quarter a week would board,lodge,and school a boy in those old simple days—and clothe him and wash him,too,for that matter.

Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom.He said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave.When Becky told her father,in strict confidence,how Tom had taken her whipping at school,the Judge was visibly moved；and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own,the Judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble,a generous,a magnanimous lie—a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with George Washington's lauded Truth about the hatchet！Becky thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that.She went straight off and told Tom about it.

Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some day.He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to the National Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country,in order that he might be ready for either career or both.

Huck Finn's wealth and the fact that he was now under the Widow Douglas'protection introduced him into society—no,dragged him into it,hurled him into it—and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear.The widow's servants kept him clean and neat,combed and brushed,and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend.He had to eat with a knife and fork；he had to use napkin,cup,and plate；he had to learn his book,he had to go to church；he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth；whithersoever he turned,the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.

He bravely bore his miseries three weeks,and then one day turned up missing.For forty-eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress.The public were profoundly concerned；they searched high and low,they dragged the river for his body.Early the third morning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughterhouse,and in one of them he found the refugee.Huck had slept there；he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food,and was lying off,now,in comfort,with his pipe.He was unkempt,uncombed,and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy.Tom routed him out,told him the trouble he had been causing,and urged him to go home.Huck's face lost its tranquil content,and took a melancholy cast.He said：

“Don't talk about it,Tom.I've tried it,and it don't work；it don't work,Tom.It ain't for me；I ain't used to it.The widder's good to me,and friendly；but I can't stand them ways.She makes me get up just at the same time every morning；she makes me wash,they comb me all to thunder；she won't let me sleep in the woodshed；I got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me,Tom；they don't seem to any air git through'em,somehow；and they're so rotten nice that I can't set down,nor lay down,nor roll around anywher's；I hain't slid on a cellar door for—well,it'pears to be years；I got to go to church and sweat and sweat—I hate them ornery sermons！I can't ketch a fly in there,I can't chaw.I got to wear shoes all Sunday.The widder eats by a bell；she goes to bed by a bell；she gits up by a bell—everything's so awful reg'lar a body can't stand it.”

“Well,everybody does that way,Huck.”

“Tom,it don't make no difference.I ain't everybody,and I can't stand it.It's awful to be tied up so.And grub comes too easy—I don't take no interest in vittles,that way.I got to ask to go a-fishing；I got to ask to go in a-swimming—dern'd if I hain't got to ask to do everything.Well,I'd got to talk so nice it wasn't no comfort—I'd got to go up in the attic and rip out awhile,every day,to git a taste in my mouth,or I'd a died,Tom.The widder wouldn't let me smoke；she wouldn't let me yell,she wouldn't let me gape,nor stretch,nor scratch,before folks—”（Then with a spasm of special irritation and injury）—”And dad fetch it,she prayed all the time！I never see such a woman！I had to shove,Tom—I just had to.And besides,that school's going to open,and I'd a had to go to it—well,I wouldn't stand that,Tom.Looky-here,Tom,being rich ain't what it's cracked up to be.It's just worry and worry,and sweat and sweat,and a-wishing you was dead all the time.Now these clothes suits me,and this bar'l suits me,and I ain't ever going to shake'em any more.Tom,I wouldn't ever got into all this trouble if it hadn't'a’ben for that money；now you just take my sheer of it along with your'n,and gimme a ten-center sometimes—not many times,becuz I don't give a dern for a thing'thout it's tollable hard to git—and you go and beg off for me with the widder.”

“Oh,Huck,you know I can't do that.'Tain't fair；and besides if you'll try this thing just a while longer you'll come to like it.”

“Like it！Yes—the way I'd like a hot stove if I was to set on it long enough.No,Tom,I won't be rich,and I won't live in them cussed smothery houses.I like the woods,and the river,and hogsheads,and I'll stick to'em,too.Blame it all！just as we'd got guns,and a cave,and all just fixed to rob,here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all！”

Tom saw his opportunity—

“Looky-here,Huck,being rich ain't going to keep me back fromturning robber.”

“No！Oh,good-licks,are you in real deadwood earnest,Tom?”

“Just as dead earnest as I'm a-sitting here.But Huck,we can't let you into the gang if you ain't respectable,you know.”

Huck's joy was quenched.

“Can't let me in,Tom?Didn't you let me go for a pirate?”

“Yes,but that's different.A robber is more high-toned than what a pirate is—as a general thing.In most countries they're awful high up in the nobility—dukes and such.”

“Now,Tom,hain't you always ben friendly to me?You wouldn't shet me out,would you,Tom?You wouldn't do that,now,would you,Tom?”

“Huck,I wouldn't want to,and I don't want to—but what would people say?Why,they'd say，'Mph！Tom Sawyer's Gang！pretty low characters in it！'they'd mean you,Huck.You wouldn't like that,and I wouldn't.”

Huck was silent for some time,engaged in a mental struggle.Finally he said：

“Well,I'll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if I can come to stand it,if you'll let me b'long to the gang,Tom.”

“All right,Huck,it's a whiz！Come along,old chap,and I'll ask the widow to let up on you a little,Huck.”

“Will you,Tom—now will you?That's good.If she'll let up on some of the roughest things,I'll smoke private and cuss private,and crowd through or bust.When you going to start the gang and turn robbers?”

“Oh,right off.We'll get the boys together and have the initiation tonight,maybe.”

“Have the which?”

“Have the initiation.”

“What's that?”

“It's to swear to stand by one another,and never tell the gang's secrets,even if you're chopped all to flinders,and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang.”

“That's gay—that's mighty gay,Tom,I tell you.”

“Well,I bet it is.And all that swearing's got to be done at midnight,in the lonesomest,awfulest place you can find—a ha'nted house is the best,but they're all ripped up now.”

“Well,midnight's good,anyway,Tom.”

“Yes,so it is.And you've got to swear on a coffin,and sign it with blood.”

“Now,that's something like！Why,it's a million times bullier than pirating.I'll stick to the widder till I rot,Tom；and if I git to be a reg'lar ripper of a robber,and everybody talking'bout it,I reckon she'll be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.”





CONCLUSION


So endeth this chronicle.It being strictly a history of a boy,it must stop here；the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a man.When one writes a novel about grown people,he knows exactly where to stop—that is,with a marriage；but when he writes of juveniles,he must stop where he best can.

Most of the characters that perform in this book still live,and are prosperous and happy.Some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be；therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their lives at present.
