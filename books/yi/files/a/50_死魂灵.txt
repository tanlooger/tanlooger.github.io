第一章


省会N市的一家旅馆的大门口，跑进了一辆讲究的，软垫子的小小的篷车，这是独身的人们，例如退伍陆军中佐，步兵二等大尉，有着百来个农奴的贵族之类——一句话，就是大家叫作中流的绅士这一类人所爱坐的车子。车里面坐着一位先生，不很漂亮，却也不难看；不太肥，可也不太瘦，说他老是不行的，然而他又并不怎么年青了。他的到来，旅馆里并没有什么惊奇，也毫不惹起一点怎样的事故；只有站在旅馆对面的酒店门口的两个乡下人，彼此讲了几句话，但也不是说坐客，倒是大抵关于马车的。“你瞧这轮子，”这一个对那一个说，“你看怎样，譬如到莫斯科，这还拉得到么？”——“成的，”那一个说，“到凯山可是保不定了，我想。”——“到凯山怕难。”那一个回答道。谈话这就完结了。当马车停在旅馆前面的时候，还遇见一个青年。他穿着又短又小的白布裤，时式的燕尾服，下面露出些坎肩，是用土拉出产的别针连起来的，针头上装饰着青铜的手枪样。这青年在伸手按住他快要被风吹去的小帽时，也向马车看了一眼，于是走掉了。

马车一进了中园，就有侍者，或者是俄国客店里惯叫作伙计的，来迎接这绅士。那是一个活泼的，勤快的家伙，勤快到看不清他究竟是怎样一副嘴脸。他一只手拿着抹布，跳了出来，是高大的少年，身穿一件很长的常礼服，衣领耸得高高的，几乎埋没了脖颈，将头发一摇，就带领着这绅士，走过那全是木造的廊下，到楼上看上帝所赐的房子去了。——房子是极其普通的一类；因为旅馆先就是极其普通的一类，像外省的市镇上所有的旅馆一样，旅客每天付给两卢布，就能开一间幽静的房间：各处的角落上，都有蟑螂像梅干似的在窥探，通到邻室的门，是用一口衣橱挡起来的，那边住着邻居，是一个静悄悄，少说话，然而出格的爱管闲事的人，关于旅客及其个人的所有每一件事，他都有兴味。这旅馆的正面的外观，就说明着内部：那是细长的楼房，楼下并不刷白，还露着暗红的砖头，这原是先就不很干净的了，经了利害的风雨，可更加黑沉沉了。楼上也像别处一样，刷着黄色。下面是出售马套，绳子和环饼的小店。那最末尾的店，要确切，还不如说是窗上的店罢，是坐着一个卖斯比丁(1)的人，带着一个红铜的茶炊(2)，和一张脸，也红得像他的茶炊一样，如果他没有一部乌黑的大胡子，远远望去，是要当作窗口摆着两个茶炊的。

这旅客还在观察自己的房子的时候，他的行李搬进来了。首先是有些磨损了的白皮的箱子，一见就知道他并不是第一次走路。这箱子，是马夫绥里方和跟丁彼得尔希加抬进来的。绥里方生得矮小，身穿短短的皮外套；彼得尔希加是三十来岁的少年人，穿一件分明是主人穿旧了的宽大的常礼服，有着正经而且容易生气的相貌，以及又大又厚的嘴唇和一样的鼻子。箱子之后，搬来的是桦木块子嵌花的桃花心木的小提箱，一对靴楦和蓝纸包着的烤鸡子。事情一完，马夫绥里方到马房里理值马匹去了，跟丁彼得尔希加就去整顿狭小的下房，那是一个昏暗的狗窠，但他却已经拿进他的外套去，也就一同带去了他独有的特别的气味。这气味，还分给着他立刻拖了进去的袋子，那里面是装着侍者修饰用的一切家伙的。他在这房子里靠墙支起一张狭小的三条腿的床来，放上一件好像棉被的东西去，蛋饼似的薄，恐怕也蛋饼似的油；这东西，是他问旅馆主人要了过来的。

用人刚刚整顿好，那主人却跑到旅馆的大厅里去了。大厅的大概情形，只要出过门的人是谁都知道的：总是油上颜色的墙壁，上面被烟熏得乌黑，下面是给旅客们的背脊磨成的伤疤，尤其是给本地的商人们，因为每逢市集的日子，他们总是六七个人一伙，到这里来喝一定的几杯茶的；照例的烟熏的天花板，照例的挂着许多玻璃珠的乌黑的烛台，侍者活泼的轮着盘子，上面像海边的鸟儿一样，放着许多茶杯，跑过那走破了的地板的蜡布上的时候，它也就发跳，发响；照例是挂满了一壁的油画；一句话，就是无论什么，到处都一样，不同的至多也不过图画里有一幅乳房很大的水妖，读者一定是还没有见过的。和这相像的自然的玩笑，在不知道从什么时候，从什么人，从什么地方弄到我们俄国来的许多历史画上，也可以看见；其中自然也有是我们的阔人和美术爱好者听了引导者的劝诱，从意大利买了回来的东西。这位绅士脱了帽，除下他毛绒的红色的围巾，这大抵是我们的太太们亲手编给她丈夫，还恳切的教给他怎样用法的；现在谁给一个鳏夫来做这事呢，我实在断不定，只有上帝知道罢了，我就从来没有用过这样的围巾。总而言之，那绅士一除下他的围巾，他就叫午膳。当搬出一切旅馆的照例的食品：放着替旅客留了七八天的花卷儿的白菜汤，还有脑子烩豌豆，青菜香肠，烤鸡子，腌王瓜，以及常备的甜的花卷儿；无论热的或冷的，来一样，就吃一样的时候，他还要使侍者或是伙计来讲种种的废话：这旅馆先前是谁的，现在的东家是谁了，能赚多少钱，东家可是一个大流氓之类，侍者就照例的回答道：“啊呀！那是大流氓呀，老爷！”恰如文明了的欧洲一样，文明的俄国也很有一大批可敬的人们，在旅馆里倘不和侍者说废话，或者拿他开玩笑，是要食不下咽的了。但这客人也并非全是无聊的质问：他又详细的打听了这市上的知事，审判厅长和检事——一句话：凡是大官，他一个也没有漏；打听得更详细的是这一带的所有出名的地主：他们每人有多少农奴，他住处离这市有多么远，性情怎样，是不是常到市里来；他也细问了这地方的情形，省界内可有什么毛病或者时疫，如红斑痧，天泡疮之类，他都问得很担心而且注意，也不像单是因为爱管闲事。这位绅士的态度，是有一点定规和法则的；连擤鼻涕也很响。真不知道他是怎么弄的，每一擤，他的鼻子就像吹喇叭一样。然而这看来并不要紧的威严，却得了侍者们的大尊敬，每逢响声起处，他们就把头发往后一摇，立正，略略低下头去，问道：“您还要用些什么呀？”吃完午膳，这绅士就喝一杯咖啡，坐在躺椅上。他把垫子塞在背后，俄国的客店里，垫子是不装绵软的羊毛，却用那很像碎砖或是沙砾的莫名其妙的东西的。他打呵欠了，叫侍者领到自己的房里，躺在床上，迷糊了两点钟。休息之后，他应了侍者的请求，在纸片上写出身分，名姓来，给他可以去呈报当局，就是警察。那侍者一面走下扶梯去，一面就一个一个的读着纸上的文字：“六等官保甫尔·伊凡诺维支·乞乞科夫，地主，私事旅行。”当侍者还没有读完单子的时候，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支·乞乞科夫却已经走出旅馆，到市上去逛去了，这分明给了他一个满足的印象；因为他发见了这省会也可以用别的一切省会来作比例的：最耀人眼的是涂在石造房子上的黄色和木造房子上的灰色。房子有一层楼的，有两层楼的，也有一层半楼的，据本地的木匠们说，是这里的建筑，都美观得出奇。房子的布置，是或者设在旷野似的大路里，无边无际的树篱中；或者彼此挤得一团糟，却也更可以分明的觉得人生和活动。到处看见些几乎完全给雨洗清了的招牌，画着花卷，或是一双长统靴，或者几条蓝裤子，下面写道：阿小裁缝店。也有一块画着无边帽和无遮帽，写道“洋商华希理·菲陀罗夫”(3)的招牌。有的招牌上，是画着一个弹子台和两个打弹子的人，都穿着燕尾服，那衣样，就像我们的戏院里一收场，就要踱上台去的看客们所穿的似的。这打弹子人画得捏定弹子棒，正要冲，臂膊微微向后，斜开了一条腿，也好像他要跳起来。画下面却写道：“弹子房在此！”也有在街路中央摆起桌子来，卖着胡桃，肥皂，和看去恰如肥皂一样的蜜糕的。再远一点有饭店，挂出来的招牌上是一条很大的鱼，身上插一把叉。遇见得最多的是双头鹰的乌黑的国徽，但现在却已经只看见简单明了的“酒店”这两个字了。石路到处都有些不大好。这绅士还去看一趟市立的公园，这是由几株瘦树儿形成的，因为看来好像要长不大，根上还支着三脚架，架子油得碧绿。这些树儿，虽然不过芦苇那么高，然而日报的“火树银花”上却写道：“幸蒙当局之德泽，本市遂有公园，遍栽嘉树，郁苍茂密，虽当炎夏，亦复清凉。”再下去是：“观民心之因洋溢之感谢而战栗，泪泉之因市长之热心而奔迸，即足见其感人之深矣”云。绅士找了警察，问过到教会，到衙门，到知事家里的最近便的路，便顺着贯穿市心的河道，走了下去。——途中还揭了一张贴在柱上的戏院的广告，这是豫备回了家慢慢的看的。接着是细看那走在木铺的人行道上的很漂亮的女人，她后面还跟着一个身穿军装，挟个小包的孩子。接着是睁大了眼睛，向四下里看了一遍，以深通这里的地势，于是就跑回家，后面跟着侍者，轻轻的扶定他，走上梯子，进了自己的房里了。接着是喝茶，于是向桌子坐下，叫点蜡烛来，从衣袋里摸出广告来看，这时就总是着他的右眼睛。广告却没有什么可看的。做的是珂者蒲(4)的诗剧，波普略文先生扮罗拉，沙勃罗瓦小姐扮珂罗。别的都是些并不出名的脚色。然而他还是看完了所有的姓名，一直到池座的价目，并且知道了这广告是市立印刷局里印出来的；接着他又把广告翻过来，看背后可还有些什么字。然而什么也没有，他擦擦眼睛，很小心的把广告迭起，收在提箱里，无论什么，只要一到手，他是一向总要收在这里面的。据我看来，白天是要以一盘冷牛肉，一杯柠檬汽水和一场沉睡收梢了——恰如我们这俄罗斯祖国的有些地方所常说的那样，鼾声如雷。

第二天都化在访问里。这旅客遍访了市里的大官。他先到知事那里致敬，这知事不肥也不瘦，恰如乞乞科夫一样，制服上挂着圣安娜勋章，据人说，不远就要得到明星勋章了；然而是一位温和的老绅士，有时还会自己在绢上绣花。其次，他访检事，访审判厅长，访警察局长，访专卖局长，访市立工厂监督……可惜的是这世界上的阔佬，总归数不完，只好断定这旅客对于拜访之举，做得很起劲就算：他连卫生监督和市的建筑技师那里，也都去表了敬意。后来他还很久的坐在篷车里，计算着该去访问的人，但是他没有访过的官员，在这市里竟一个也想不出来了。和阔人谈话的时候，他对谁都是恭维。看见知事，就微微的露一点口风，说是到贵省来，简直如登天堂，道路很出色，正像铺着天鹅绒一样；又接着说，放出去做官的都是贤明之士，所以当轴是值得最高的赞颂和最大的鉴识的。对警察局长，他很称赞了一通这市里的警察，对副知事和审判厅长呢，两个人虽然还不过五等官，他却在谈话中故意错叫了两回“大人”，又很中了他们的意了。那结果是，知事就在当天邀他赴自己家里的小夜会；别的官员们也各各招待他，一个请吃中饭，别个是玩一场波士顿(5)或者喝杯茶。

关于自己，这旅客回避着多谈。即使谈起来，也大抵不着边际。他显着惊人的谦虚，这之际，他的口气就滑得像背书一样，例如：他在这世界上，不过是无足重轻的一条虫，并没有令人注意的价值。在他一生中，已经经历过许多事，也曾为真理受苦，还有着不少要他性命的敌人。现在他终于想要休息了，在寻一块小地方，给他能够安静的过活。因此他以为一到这市里，首先去拜谒当局诸公，并且向他们表明他最高的敬意，乃是自己的第一义务云。市民对于这忙着要赴知事的夜会的生客所能知道的，就只有这一点。那赴会的标准，却足足费了两点钟，这位客人白天里的专心致志的化装，真是很不容易遇见的。午后睡了一下，他就叫拿脸盆来，将肥皂抹在两颊上，用舌头从里面顶着，刮了很久很久的时光。于是拿过侍者肩上的手巾，来擦他的圆脸，无处不到，先从耳朵后面开头，还靠近着侍者的脸孔，咕咕的哼了两回鼻子。于是走到镜面前，套好前胸衣，剪掉两根露出的鼻毛，就穿上了越橘色的红红的闪闪的燕尾服。他这样的化过装，即走上自己的篷车，在只从几家窗户里漏出来的微光照着的很阔的街道上驰过去。知事府里，却正如要开夜会一样，里面很辉煌，门口停有点着明灯的车子，还站着两个宪兵。远处有马夫们的喊声；总而言之，应有尽有。当乞乞科夫跨进大厅的时候，他不得不把眼睛细了一下子，因为那烛，灯，以及太太们的服饰的光亮，实在强得很。无论什么都好像浇上了光明。乌黑的燕尾服，或者一个，或者一群，在大厅里蠢动，恰如大热的七月里，聚在白糖块上的苍蝇，管家婆在开着的窗口敲冰糖，飞散着又白又亮的碎片：所有的孩子们都围住她，惊奇的尽看那拿着槌子的善于做事的手的运动，苍蝇的大队驾了轻风，雄赳赳地飞过来，仿佛它们就是一家之主，并且利用了女人的近视和眩她眼睛的阳光，就这边弄碎了可口的小片，那边撒散了整个的大块。丰年的夏天，吃的东西多到插不下脚，它们飞来了，却并不是为了吃，只不过要在糖堆上露脸，用前脚或后脚彼此摩一摩，在翅子下面去擦一擦，或者张开两条前脚，在小脑袋下面搔一搔，于是雄赳赳的转一个身，飞掉了，却立刻从新编成一大队，又复飞了回来。乞乞科夫还不及细看情形，就被知事拉着臂膊，去绍介给知事夫人了。当此之际，这旅客也不至于胡涂：他对这太太说了几句不亢不卑，就是恰合于中等官阶的中年男子的应酬话。几对跳舞者要占地方，所有旁观的人们只好靠壁了，他就反背着两只手，向跳舞者很注意的看了几分钟。那些太太们大都穿得很好，也时式，但也有就在这市里临时弄来应急的。绅士们也像别处一样，可以分成两大类：一类很瘦，始终钉着女人；有几个还和彼得堡绅士很难加以区别；他们一样是很小心的梳过胡子，须样一样是很好看，有意思，或者却不过漂亮而已，一张刮得精光的鸡蛋脸，也一样是拼命的跟着女人，法国话也说得很好，使太太们笑断肚肠筋，也正如在彼得堡一样。别一类是胖子，或者像乞乞科夫那样的，不太肥，然而也并不怎么瘦。他们是完全两样的，对于女人，不看，避开，只在留心着知事的家丁，可在什么地方摆出一顶打牌的绿罩桌子来没有。他们的脸都滚圆，胖大，其中也有有着疣子或是麻点的；他们的发样既不挂落，也不卷缩，又不是法国人的à la Diable m'emporte(6)式，头发是剪短的，或者梳得很平，他们的脸相因此就越加显得滚圆，威武。这都是本市的可敬的大官。唉唉！在这世界上，胖子实在比瘦子会办事。瘦子们的做官大抵只靠着特别的嘱咐，或者不过充充数，跑跑腿；他们的存在轻得很，空气似的，简直靠不住。但胖子们是不来占要路的旁边之处的，他们总是抓住紧要的地位，如果坐下去，就坐得稳稳当当，使椅子在他们下面发响，要炸，但他们还是处之泰然。他们不喜欢好看的外观，燕尾服自然不及瘦子们的做得好，但他们的钱柜子是满满的，还有上帝保佑。只要三年，瘦子就没有一个还未抵债的农奴了，胖子却过得很安乐，看罢——忽然在市边的什么地方造起一所房子来了，是太太出面的，接着又在别的市边造第二所，后来就在近市之处买一块小田地，于是是连带一切附属东西的大村庄。凡胖子，总是在给上帝和皇上出力，博得一切尊敬之后，就退职下野，化为体面的俄罗斯地主，弄一所好房子，平安的，幸福的，而且愉快的过活的。但他的瘦子孙却又会遵照那很好的俄罗斯的老例，飞毛腿似的把祖遗产业化得一干二净。我们的乞乞科夫看了这一群，就生出大概这样的意思来，是瞒也瞒不过去的，结果是他决计加入胖子类里去，这里有他并不陌生的脸孔：有浓黑眉毛的检事，常常着左眼，仿佛是在说：“请您到隔壁的房里来，我要和您讲句话。”——但倒是一个认真，沉静的人。有邮政局长，生得矮小，但会说笑话，又是哲学家；还有审判厅长，是一个通世故，惬人心的绅士——他们都像见了老朋友似的欢迎他，乞乞科夫却只招呼了一下，然而也没有失礼貌。在这里他又结识了一个高雅可爱的绅士，是地主，姓叫玛尼罗夫的，以及一个绅士梭巴开维支，外观有些卤莽，立刻踏了他一脚，于是说道：“对不起。”人们邀他去打牌，他照例很规矩的鞠一鞠躬，答应了。大家围着绿罩桌子坐下，直到夜膳时候还没有散。认真的做起事来，就话也不说了，这是什么时候全都这样的。连很爱说话的邮政局长，牌一到手，他的脸上也就显出一种深思的表情，用下唇裹着上唇，到散场都保持着这态度，如果打出花牌来，他的手总是在桌子上使劲的一拍，倘是皇后，就说：“滚，老虔婆！”要是一张皇帝呢，那就叫道：“滚你的丹波夫庄家汉！”但审判厅长却回答道：“我来拔这汉子的胡子罢！我来拔这婆娘的胡子罢！”当他们打出牌来的时候，间或也漏些这样的口风：“什么：随便罢，有钻石呢！”或者不过说：“心！心儿！毕克宝宝。”或者是“心仔，毕婆，毕佬！”或者简直叫作“毕鬼”。这是他们一伙里称呼大家压着的牌的名目。打完之后，照例是大声发议论。我们的新来的客人也一同去辩论，但是他有分寸，使大家都觉得他议论是发的，却总是灵活得有趣，他从来不说：“您来呀……”说的是“请您出手……”或者“对不起，我收了您的二罢”之类。倘要对手高兴，他就递过磁釉的鼻烟壶去，那底里可以看见两朵紫罗兰，为的是要增加些好香味。我们的旅客以为最有意思的，是先前已经说过的两位地主，玛尼罗夫和梭巴开维支。他立刻悄悄的去向审判厅长和邮政局长打听他们的事情。看起他所问的几点来，就知道这旅客并非单为了好奇，其实是别有缘故的，因为他首先打听他们有多少农奴，他们的田地是什么状态；然后也问了他俩的本名和父称。(7)不多工夫，他就把他们俩笼络成功了。地主玛尼罗夫年纪并不大，那眼睛却糖似的甜，笑起来细成一条线，佩服他到了不得。他握着他的手，有许多工夫，一面很热心的请他光临自己的敝村，并且说，那村，离市栅也不过十五维尔斯他(8)，乞乞科夫很恭敬的点头，紧握着手，说自己不但以赴这邀请为莫大的荣幸，实在倒是本身的神圣的义务。梭巴开维支却说得很简洁：“我也请您去。”于是略一弯腰，把脚也略略的一并，他穿着大到出人意外的长靴，在俄国的巨人和骑士已经死绝了的现在，要寻适合于这样长靴的一双脚，恐怕是很不容易的了。

第二天，乞乞科夫被警察局长邀去吃中饭并且参加夜会了。饭后三点钟，大家入坐打牌，一直打到夜两点。这回他又结识了一个地主罗士特来夫，是三十岁光景的爽直的绅士，只讲过几句话，就和他“你”“我”了起来。罗士特来夫对警察局长和检事也这样，弄得很亲热；但到开始赌着大注输赢的时候，警察局长和检事就都留心他吃去的牌，连他打出来的，也每张看着不放松了。次日晚上，乞乞科夫在审判厅长的家里，客人中间有两位是太太，主人却穿着有点脏了的便衣来招呼。后来他还赴副知事的晚餐，赴白兰地专卖局长的大午餐会和检事的小小的午餐会，但场面却和大宴一样；终于还被市长邀去赴他家里的茶会去了，这会的化费，也不下于正式的午餐。一句话，他是几乎没有一刻工夫在家里的，回到旅馆来，不过是睡觉。这旅客到处都相宜，显得他是很有经验很通世故的人物，每逢谈天，他也总是谈得很合拍的；说到养马，他也讲一点养马；说到好狗，他也供献几句非常有益的意见；讲起地方审判厅的判决来罢——他就给你知道他关于审判方面，也并非毫无知识；讲到打弹子——他又打得并不脱空；一谈到道德——他也很有见识，眼泪汪汪的谈道德；讲到制造白兰地酒呢，他也知道制造白兰地酒的妙法——或者讲到税关稽查和税关官吏罢——他也会谈，仿佛他自己就做过税关官吏和税关稽查似的。但在谈吐上，他总给带着一种认真的调子，到底一直对付了过去，却实在值得惊叹的。他说得不太响，也不太低，正是适得其当。总而言之：无论从那一方面看，他从头到脚，是一位好绅士。所有官员，都十分高兴这新客的光临。知事说他是好心人——检事说他是精明人——宪兵队长说他有学问——审判厅长说他博学而可敬——警察局长说他可敬而可爱，而警察局长太太则说他很可爱，而且是知趣的人。连不很说人好话的梭巴开维支，当他在夜间从市里回家，脱掉衣服，上床躺到他那精瘦的太太旁边去的时候，也就说：“宝贝，今天我在知事那里吃夜饭，警察局长那里吃中饭，认识了六等官保甫尔·伊凡诺维支·乞乞科夫：一个很好的绅士！”他的太太说了一声“嗡”，并且轻轻的蹬了他一脚。

对于我们的客人的，这样的夸奖的意见，在市里传布，而且留存了，一直到这旅客的奇特的性质，以及一种计画，或是乡下人之所谓“掉枪花”，几乎使全市的人们非常惊疑的时候。关于这，读者是不久就会明白的。

第二章


这客人在市里住了一礼拜以上了，每天是吃午餐，赴夜会，真是所谓度着快乐的日子。终于他决心要到市外去，就是照着约定，去访问那两位地主，玛尼罗夫和梭巴开维支了。但他的下了这决心，似乎骨子里也还有别的更切实的原因，更要紧的事故……但这些事，读者只要耐心看下去，也就自然会慢慢的明白起来的，因为这故事长得很，事情也越拉越广，而且越近收场，也越加要紧的缘故。马夫绥里方得到吩咐，一早就在那篷车上驾起马匹来；彼得尔希加所受的却是留在家里，守着房子和箱子的命令。就在这里把我们的大脚色的两个家丁，给读者来绍介一下，大约也不算多事的罢。当然，他们俩并不是什么重要人物，仅仅是所谓第二流或者第三流的人们，而且这史诗的骨干和显著的展开，也和他们无关，至多也不过碰一下，或者带一笔；——但作者是什么事都极喜欢精细的，他自己虽然是一个很好的俄国人，而审慎周详却像德国人一样。但也用不着怎么多的时光和地方，读者已经知道，例如彼得尔希加，是穿着他主人穿旧的不合身的灰色常礼服，而且有着奴仆类中人无不如此的大鼻子和厚嘴唇的，这以外，也没有加添什么的必要了。至于性质，是爱沉默，不爱多言，还有好学的高尚的志向，因为他在拼命的读书，虽然并不懂得内容是怎样：“情爱英雄冒险记”也好，小学的初等读本或是祷告书也好，他完全一视同仁——都一样的读得很起劲；如果给他一本化学教科书——大约也不会不要的。他所高兴的并非他在读什么，高兴的是在读书，也许不如说，是在读下去，字母会拼出字来，有趣得很，可是这字的意义，却不懂也不要紧。这读书，是大抵在下房里，躺在床上的棉被上面来做的，棉被也因此弄得又薄又硬，像蛋饼一样。读书的热心之外，他还有两样习惯，也就是他这人的两个特征：他喜欢和衣睡觉，就是睡的时候，也还是穿着行立时候所穿的那件常礼服，还有一样是他有一种特别的臭味，有些像卧房的气味，即使是空屋，只要他搭起床来，搬进他的外套和随身什物去，那屋子就像十年前就已经住了人似的了。乞乞科夫是一位很敏感的，有时简直可以说是很难服侍的主子，早上，这臭味一扑上他灵敏的鼻子来，他就摇着头，呵斥道：“该死的，昏蛋！在出汗罢？去洗回澡！”彼得尔希加却一声也不响，只管做他的事；他拿了刷子，刷刷挂在壁上的主人的燕尾服，或者单是整理整理房间。他默默的在想什么呢？也许是在心里说：“你的话倒也不错的！一样的话说了四十遍，你还没有说厌吗……”家丁受了主人的训斥，他在怎么想呢，连上帝也很难明白的。关于彼得尔希加，现在也只能说述他这一点点。

马夫绥里方却是一个完全两样的人……但是，总将下流社会来绍介给读者，作者却实在觉得过意不去，因为他从经验，知道读者们是很不喜欢认识下等人的。凡俄国人：倘使见着比自己较高一等的人，就拼命的去结识，和伯爵或侯爵应酬几句，也比和彼此同等的人结了亲密的友谊更喜欢。就是本书的主角不过是一个六等官，作者也担心得很。假使是七等官之流，那也许肯去亲近的罢，但如果是已经升到将军地位的人物——上帝知道，可恐怕竟要投以傲然的对于爬在他脚跟下的人们那样的鄙夷不屑的一瞥了，或者简直还要坏，即是置之不理，也就制了作者的死命。但纵使这两层怎么恼人，我们也还得回到我们的主角那里去。他是先一晚就清清楚楚的发过必要的命令的了，一早醒来，洗脸，用湿的海绵从头顶一直擦到脚尖，这是礼拜天才做的——但刚刚凑巧，这一天正是礼拜天——于是刮脸，一直刮到他的两颊又光又滑像缎子，穿起那件闪闪的越橘色的燕尾服，罩上熊皮做的大外套，侍者扶着他的臂膊，时而这边，时而那边，走下楼梯去。他坐上马车，那车就格格的响着由旅馆大门跑出街上去了。过路的牧师脱下帽子来和他招呼；穿着龌龊小衫的几个野孩子伸着手，“好心老爷呀，布施点我们可怜的孤儿罢！”的求乞。马夫看见有一个总想爬上车后面的踏台来，就响了一声鞭子，马车便在石路上磕撞着跑远了。远远的望见画着条纹的市栅，这高兴是不小的，这就是表示着石路不久也要和别的各种苦楚一同完结。乞乞科夫的头再在车篷上重重的碰了几回之后，车子这才走到柔软的泥路上。一出市外，路两边也就来了无味而且无聊的照例的风景：长着苔藓的小土冈，小的枞林，小而又低又疏的松林，焦掉的老石楠的干子，野生的杜松，以及诸如此类。间或遇见拖得线一般长的村落。那房屋的造法，仿佛堆积着旧木柴。凡有小屋子，都是灰色的屋顶，檐下挂着雕花的木头的装饰，那样子，好像手巾上面的绣花。几个穿羊皮袍子的农夫，照例的坐在门口的板凳上打呵欠。圆脸的束胸的农妇，在从上面的窗口窥探；下面的窗口呢，露出小牛的脸或者乱拱着猪子的鼻头。一言以蔽之：千篇一律的风景。走了十五维尔斯他之后，乞乞科夫记得起来了，照玛尼罗夫的话，那庄子离这里就还不远了；但又走过了第十六块里程牌，还是看不见像个村庄的处所。假使在路上没有遇见两个农夫，恐怕他们是不会幸而达到目的地的。听得有人问萨玛尼罗夫村还有多么远，他们都脱了帽，其中的一个，显得较为聪明，留着尖劈式胡子的，便回答道：“你问的恐怕是玛尼罗夫村，不是萨玛尼罗夫村罢？”

“哦哦，是的，玛尼罗夫村。”

“玛尼罗夫村！你再走一维尔斯他，那就到了，这就是，你只要一直的往右走。”

“往右？”马夫问道。

“往右，”农夫说，“这就是上玛尼罗夫村去的路呀。一定没有萨玛尼罗夫村的。它的名字叫作玛尼罗夫村。萨玛尼罗夫村可是什么地方也没有的。一到那里，你就看见山上有一座石头的二层楼，就是老爷的府上。老爷就住在那里面。这就是玛尼罗夫村。那地方，萨玛尼罗夫村可是没有的，向来没有的。”

驶开车，寻玛尼罗夫村去了。又走了两维尔斯他，到得一条野路上。于是又走了两，三，以至四维尔斯他之远，却还是看不见石造的楼房。这时乞乞科夫记起了谁的话来，如果有一个朋友在自己的村庄里招待我们，说是相距十五维尔斯他，则其实是有三十维尔斯他的。玛尼罗夫村为了位置的关系，访问者很不多。邸宅孤另另的站在高冈上，只要有风，什么地方都吹得着。冈子的斜坡上，满生着剪得整整齐齐的短草；其间还有几个种着紫丁香和黄刺槐的英国式的花坛。五六株赤杨处处簇作小丛，扬着它带些小叶的疏疏的枝杪。从其中的两株下面，看见一座蓝柱子的绿色平顶的园亭，扁上的字是“静观堂”；再远一点，碧草丛中有一个池子，在俄国地主的英国式花园里，这是并不少见的。这冈子的脚边，沿着坡路，到处闪烁着灰色的小木屋，不知道为什么，本书的主角便立刻去数起来了，却有二百所以上。这些屋子，都精光的站着，看不见一株小树或是一点新鲜的绿色；所见的全是粗大的木头。只有两个农妇在给这村落风景添些活气，她们像图画似的撩起了衣裙，池水浸到膝弯，在拉一张缚在两条木棍上头的破网，捉住了两只虾和一条银光闪闪的鲈鱼。她们仿佛在争闹，彼此相骂着似的。旁边一点，松林远远地显着冷静的青苍。连气候也和这风景相宜，天色不太明，也不太暗，是一种亮灰的颜色，好像我们那平时很和气，一到礼拜天就烂醉了的卫戍兵的旧操衣。来补足这幅图画的豫言天候的雄鸡，也并没有缺少。它虽然为了照例的恋爱事件，头上给别的雄鸡们的嘴啄了一个几乎到脑的窟窿，却依然毫不措意，大声的报着时光，拍着那撕得像两条破席一般的翅子。当乞乞科夫渐近大门的时候，就看见那主人穿着毛织的绿色常礼服，站在阶沿上，搭凉棚似的用手遮在额上，研究着逐渐近来的篷车。篷车愈近门口，他的眼就愈加显得快活，脸上的微笑也愈加扩大了。

“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”乞乞科夫一下车，他就叫起来了。“您到底还是记得我们的！”

两个朋友彼此亲密的接过吻，玛尼罗夫便引他的朋友到屋里去。从大门走过前厅，走过食堂，虽然快得很，但我们却想利用了这极短的时间，成不成自然说不定，来讲讲关于这主人的几句话。不过作者应该声明，这样的计画，是很困难的。还是用大排场，来描写一个性格的容易。这里只好就是这样的把颜料抹上画布去——发闪的黑眼睛，浓密的眉毛，深的额上的皱纹，俨然的搭在肩头的乌黑或是血红的外套——小照画好了；然而，这样的到处皆是的，外观非常相像的绅士，是因为看惯了罢，却大概都有些什么微妙的，很难捉摸的特征的——这些人的小照就很难画。倘要这微妙的，若有若无的特征摆在眼面前，就必须格外的留心，还得将那用鉴识人物所练就的眼光，很深的射进人的精神的底里去。

玛尼罗夫是怎样的性格呢，恐怕只有上帝能够说出来罢。有这样的一种人：恰如俄国俗谚的所谓不是鱼，不是肉，既不是这，也不是那，并非城里的波格丹，又不是乡下的绥里方。(1)玛尼罗夫大概就可以排在他们这一类里的。他的风采很体面，相貌也并非不招人欢喜，但这招人欢喜里，总很夹着一些甜腻味；在应酬和态度上，也总显出些竭力收揽着对手的欢心模样来。他笑起来很媚人，浅色的头发，明蓝的眼睛。和他一交谈，在最初的一会，谁都要喊出来道：“一个多么可爱而出色的人呵！”但停一会，就什么话也不能说了，再过一会，便心里想：“呸，这是什么东西呀！”于是离了开去；如果不离开，那就立刻觉得无聊得要命。从他这里，是从来听不到一句像别人那样，讲话触着心里事，便会说了出来的泼剌或是不逊的言语的。每个人都有他的玩艺儿：有的喜欢猎狗；有的以了不得的音乐爱好者自居，以为深通这艺术的奥妙；第三个不高兴吃午餐；第四个不安于自己的本分，总要往上钻，就是一两寸也好；第五个原不过怀一点小希望，睡觉就说梦话，要和侍从武官在园游会里傲然散步，给朋友，熟人，连不相识的人们都瞧瞧；第六个手段很高强，至于起了要讽剌一下阔人或是傻子的出奇的大志；而第七个的手段却实在有限得很，不过到处弄得很齐整，借此讨些站长先生或是搭客马车夫之流的喜欢。总而言之，谁都有一点什么东西的，就是他的个性，只有玛尼罗夫却没有这样的东西。在家里他不大说话，只是沉思，冥想，他在想些什么呢，也只有上帝知道罢了。说他在经营田地罢，也不成，他就从来没有走到野地里去过，什么都好像是自生自长的，和他没干系。如果经理来对他说：“东家，我们还是这么这么办的好罢。”他那照例的回答是：“是的，是的，很不坏！”他仍旧静静的吸他的烟，这是他在军队里服务时候养成的习惯，他那时算是一个最和善，最有教养的军官。“是的，是的，实在很不坏！”他又说一遍。如果一个农夫到他这里来，搔着耳朵背后，说：“老爷，可以放我去缴捐款么？”那么，他就回答道：“去就是了！”于是又立刻吸他的烟，那农夫不过去喝酒，却连想也没有想到的。有时也从石阶梯上眺望着他的村子和他的池，说道，如果从这屋子里打一条隧道，或者在池上造一座石桥，两边开店，商人们卖着农夫要用的什物，那可多么出色呢。于是他的眼睛就愈加甜腻腻，脸上显出满足之至的表情。但这些计画，总不过是一句话。他的书房里总放着一本书，在第十四页间总夹着一条书签；这一本书，他是还在两年以前看起的。在家里总是缺少着什么；客厅里却陈设着体面的家具，绷着华丽的绢布，化的钱一定是很不在少的；然而到得最后的两把靠手椅，材料不够了，就永远只绷着麻袋布；四年以来，每有客来，主人总要豫先发警告：“您不要坐这把椅子，这还没有完工哩。”在别一间屋子里，却简直没有什么家具，虽然新婚后第二天，玛尼罗夫就对他的太太说过：“心肝，我们明天该想法子了，至少，我们首先得弄些家具来。”到夜里，就有一座高高的华美的古铜烛台摆在桌上了，铸着三位希腊的格拉支(2)，还有一个螺钿的罩，然而旁边却是一个平常的，粗铜的，跛脚的，弯腰的，而且积满了油腻的烛台，主人和主妇，还有做事的人们，倒也好像全都不在意。他的太太……他们是彼此十分满足的。结婚虽然已经八年多，但还是分吃着苹果片，糖果或胡桃，用一种表示真挚之爱的动人的娇柔的声音，说道：“张开你的口儿来呀，小心肝，我要给你这一片呢。”这时候，那不消说，她的口儿当然是很优美的张了开来的。一到生日，就准备各种惊人的赠品——例如琉璃的牙粉盒之类。也常有这样的事，他们俩都坐在躺椅上，也不知为了什么缘故，他放下烟斗来，她也放下了拿在手里的活计，来一个很久很久的身心交融的接吻，久到可以吸完一枝小雪茄。总而言之，他们是，就是所谓幸福，自然，也还有别的事，除了彼此长久的接吻和准备惊人的赠品之外，家里也还有许多事要做，各种问题也是层出不穷的。例如食物为什么做得这样又坏又傻呀？仓库为什么这么空呀？管家妇为什么要偷呀？当差的为什么总是这么又脏又醉呀？仆人为什么睡得这么没规矩，醒来又只管胡闹呀？但这些都是俗务，玛尼罗夫夫人却是一位受过好教育的闺秀。这好教育，谁都知道，是要到慈惠女塾里去受的，而在这女塾里，谁都知道，则以三种主要科目，为造就一切人伦道德之基础：法国话，这是使家族得享家庭的幸福的；弹钢琴，这是使丈夫能有多少愉快的时光的；最后是经济部份，就是编钱袋和诸如此类的惊人的赠品。那教育法，也还有许多改善和完成，尤其是在我们现在的这时候：这是全在于慈惠女塾塾长的才能和力量的。有些女塾，是钢琴第一，其次法国话，末后才是经济科。但也有反过来：首先倒是经济科，就是编织小赠品之类，其次法国话，末后弹钢琴。总之，教育法是有各式各样的，但这里正是声明的地方了，那玛尼罗夫夫人……不，老实说，我是很有些怕敢讲起大家闺秀的，况且我也早该回到我们这本书的主角那里去，他们都站在客厅的门口，彼此互相谦逊，要别人先进门去，已经有好几分钟了。

“请呀，您不要这么客气，请呀，您先请。”乞乞科夫说。

“不能的，请罢，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，您是我的客人呀。”玛尼罗夫回答道，用手指着门。

“可是我请您不要这么费神，不行的，请请，您不要这么费神；请请，请您先一步。”乞乞科夫说。

“那可不能，请您原谅，我是不能使我的客人，一位这样体面的，有教育的绅士，走在我的后面的。”

“那里有什么教育呢！请罢请罢，还是请您先一步。”

“不成不成，请您赏光，请您先一步。”

“那又为什么呢？”

“哦哦，就是这样子！”玛尼罗夫带着和气的微笑，说。这两位朋友终于并排走进门去了，大家略略挤了一下。

“请您许可我来绍介贱内。”玛尼罗夫说。“心儿！这位是保甫尔·伊凡诺维支。”

乞乞科夫这才看见一位太太，当他和玛尼罗夫在门口互相逊让的时候，是毫没有留心到的。她很漂亮，衣服也相称。穿的是淡色绢的家常便服，非常合式；她那纤手慌忙把什么东西抛在桌子上，整好了四角绣花的薄麻布的头巾。于是从坐着的沙发上站起来了。乞乞科夫倒也愉快似的在她手上吻了一吻。玛尼罗夫夫人就用她那带些粘舌头的调子对他说，他的光临，真给他们很大的高兴，她的男人，是没有一天不记挂他的。

“对啦，”玛尼罗夫道，“贱内常常问起我：‘你的朋友怎么还不来呢？’我可是回答道：‘等着就是，他就要来了！’现在您竟真的光降了。这真给我们大大的放了心——这就像一个春天，就像一个心的佳节。”

一说到心的佳节的话，乞乞科夫倒颇有些着慌，就很客气的分辩他并不是一个什么有着大的名声，或是高的职位和衔头的人物。

“您都有的，”玛尼罗夫含着照例的高兴的微笑，堵住他的嘴，“您都有的，而且怕还在其上哩！”

“您觉得我们的市怎么样？”玛尼罗夫夫人问道。“过得还适意么？”

“出色的都市，体面的都市！”乞乞科夫说。“真过得适意极了；交际场中的人物都非常之恳切，非常之优秀！”

“那么，我们的市长，您以为怎样呢？”玛尼罗夫夫人还要问下去。

“可不是吗？是一位非常可敬，非常可爱的绅士呵！”玛尼罗夫夹着说。

“对极了。”乞乞科夫道。“真是一位非常可敬的绅士！对于职务是很忠实的，而且看得职务又很明白的！但愿我们多有几个这样的人才。”

“大约您也知道，要他办什么，他没有什么不能办，而且那态度，也真的是漂亮。”玛尼罗夫微笑着，接下去说，满足得细眯了眼，好像有人在搔它耳朵背后的猫儿。

“真是一位非常恳切，非常文雅的绅士！”乞乞科夫道。“而且又是一个怎样的美术家呀！我真想不到他会做这么出色的刺绣和手艺。他给我看过一个自己绣出来的钱袋子；要绣得这么好，就在闺秀们中恐怕也很难找到的。”

“那么，副知事呢？是一位出色的人！可对？”玛尼罗夫说，又细眯了眼。

“是一位非常高超，极可尊敬的人物呀！”乞乞科夫回答道。

“请您再许可我问一件事：您以为警察局长怎么样？也是一位很可爱的绅士罢？可是呢？”

“哦哦，那真是一位非常可爱的绅士！而且又聪明，又博学！我和检事，还有审判厅长，在他家里打过一夜牌的。实在是一位非常可爱的绅士！”

“还有警察局长的太太，您觉得怎么样呀？”玛尼罗夫夫人问。“您不觉得她也是一位非常和蔼的闺秀么？”

“哦哦，在我所认识的闺秀们里面，她也正是最可敬服的一位了！”乞乞科夫回答说。

审判厅长和邮政局长也没有被忘记；全市的官吏，几乎个个得到品评，而且都成了极有声价的人物。

“您总在村庄里过活么？”乞乞科夫终于问。

“一年里总有一大部份！”玛尼罗夫答道。“我们有时也上市里去，会会那些有教育的人们。您知道，如果和世界隔开，人简直是要野掉的。”

“真的，一点不错！”乞乞科夫回答说。

“要是那样，那自然另一回事了，”玛尼罗夫接着说，“如果有着很好的邻居，如果有着这样的人，可以谈谈譬如优美的礼节，精雅的仪式，或是什么学问的——您知道，那么，心就会感动得好像上了天……”他还想说下去，但又觉得很有点脱线了，便只在空中挥着手，说道：“那么，就是住在荒僻的乡下，自然也好得很。可是我全没有这样的人。至多，不过有时看看《祖国之子》(3)罢了。”

乞乞科夫是完全同意的，但他又加添说，最好不过的是独自过活，享用着天然美景，有时也看看书……

“但您知道，”玛尼罗夫说，“如果没有朋友，又怎么能够彼此……”

“那倒是的，不错，一点也不错！”乞乞科夫打断他。“就是有了世界上一切宝贝，又有什么好处呢？贤人说过：‘好朋友胜于世上一切的财富。’”

“但您知道，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，”玛尼罗夫说，同时显出一种亲密的脸相，或者不如说是太甜了的，恰如老于世故的精干的医生，知道只要弄得甜，病人就喜欢吃，于是尽量的加了糖汁的药水一样的脸相，说，“那就完全不同了，可以说——精神的享乐……例如现在似的，能够和您扳谈，享受您有益的指教，那就是幸福，我敢说，那就是难得的出色的幸福呵……”

“不不，怎么说是有益的指教呢？……我只是一个不足道的人，什么也没有。”乞乞科夫回答道。

“唉唉，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！我来说一句老实话罢！只要给我一部份像您那样的伟大的品格，我就高高兴兴的情愿抛掉一半家财！”

“却相反，我倒情愿……”

如果仆人不进来说食物已经准备好，这两位朋友的彼此披肝沥胆，就很难说什么时候才会完结了。

“那么，请罢。”玛尼罗夫说。

“请您原谅，我们这里是拿不出大都市里，大第宅里那样的午饭来的：我们这里很简陋，照俄国风俗，只有菜汤，但是诚心诚意。请您赏光罢。”

为了谁先进去的事，他们又争辩了一通，但乞乞科夫终于侧着身子，横走进去了。

食堂里有两个孩子在等候，是玛尼罗夫的儿子；他们已经到了上桌同吃的年纪了，但还得坐高脚椅。他们旁边站着一个家庭教师，恭恭敬敬的微笑着鞠躬。主妇对了汤盘坐下，客人得坐在主人和主妇的中间，仆人给孩子们系好了饭巾。

“多么出色的孩子呵！”乞乞科夫向孩子们看了一眼，说。“多大年纪了？”

“大的七岁，小的昨天刚满六岁了。”玛尼罗夫夫人说明道。

“绥密斯多克利由斯！”玛尼罗夫向着大的一个，说，他正在把下巴从仆人给他缚上了的饭巾里挣出来。乞乞科夫一听到玛尼罗夫所起的，不知道为什么要用“由斯”收梢的希腊气味名字，就把眉毛微微一扬；但他又赶紧使自己的脸立刻变成平常模样了。

“绥密斯多克利由斯，告诉我，法国最好的都会是那里呀？”

这时候，那教师就把全副精神都贯注在绥密斯多克利由斯身上了，几乎要跳进他的眼睛里面去，但到得绥密斯多克利由斯说是“巴黎”的时候，也就放了心，只是点着头。

“那么，我们这里的最好的都会呢？”玛尼罗夫又问。

教师的眼光又紧钉着孩子了。

“彼得堡！”绥密斯多克利由斯答。

“还有呢？”

“莫斯科。”绥密斯多克利由斯道。

“多么聪明的孩子呵！了不得，这孩子！”乞乞科夫说。“您看就是……”他向着玛尼罗夫显出吃惊的样子来。“这么小，就有这样的智识。我敢说，这孩子是有非凡的才能的！”

“阿，您还不知道他呢！”玛尼罗夫回答道。“他实在机灵得很。那小的一个，亚勒吉特，就没有这么灵了，他却不然……只要看见一点什么，甲虫儿或是小虫子罢，就两只眼睛闪闪的，钉着看，研究它。我想把他养成外交官呢。绥密斯多克利由斯，”他又转脸向着那孩子，接着说，“你要做全权大使么？”

“要。”绥密斯多克利由斯回答着，一面正在摇头摆脑的嚼他的面包。

但站在椅子背后的仆人，这时却给全权大使擦了一下鼻子，这实在是必要的，否则，毫无用处的一大滴，就要掉在汤里了。谈天是大抵关于幽静的退隐的田园生活的风味的，但被主妇的几句品评市里的戏剧和演员的话所打断。教师非常注意的凝视着主客，一觉得他们的脸上有些笑影，便把嘴巴张得老大，笑得发抖。大约他很有感德之心，想用了这方法，来报答主人的知遇的。只有一次，他却显出可怕的模样来了，在桌上严厉的一敲，眼光射着坐在对面的孩子。这是好办法，因为绥密斯多克利由斯把亚勒吉特的耳朵咬了一口，那一个便挤细眼睛，大张着嘴，要痛哭起来了；然而他觉得也许因此失去好吃的东西，便使嘴巴恢复了原状，开始去啃他的羊骨头，两颊都弄得油光闪闪的，眼泪还在这上面顺流而下。

主妇常常向乞乞科夫说着这样的话：“您简直什么也没有吃，您可是吃得真少呀。”这时乞乞科夫就照例的回答道：“多谢得很，我很饱了。愉快的谈心，比好菜蔬还要有味呢。”于是大家离开了食桌。玛尼罗夫很满足，正想就把客人邀进客厅去，伸手放在他背上，轻轻的一按，乞乞科夫却已经显着一副大有深意的脸相，说是他因为有一件很重要的事情，必须和他谈一谈。

“那么，请您同到我的书房里去罢，”玛尼罗夫说着，引客人进了一间小小的精舍，窗门正对着青葱的闪烁的树林，“这是我的小窠。”玛尼罗夫说。

“好一间舒适的屋子。”乞乞科夫的眼光在房里打量了一遍，说。这确是有许多很惬人意的：四壁抹着半蓝半灰的无以名之的颜色；家具是四把椅子，一把靠椅和一张桌子，桌上有先前说过的夹着书签的一本书，写过字的几张纸，但最引目的是许多烟。烟也各式各样的放着：有用纸包起来的，有装在烟盒里面的，也有简直就堆在桌上的。两个窗台上，也各有几小堆从烟斗里挖出来的烟灰，因为要排得整齐，好看，很费过一番心计的。这些工作，总令人觉得主人就在借此消遣着时光。

“请您坐在靠椅上，”玛尼罗夫说，“坐在这里舒适点。”

“请您许可，让我坐在椅子上罢！”

“请您许可，不让您坐椅子！”玛尼罗夫含笑说。“这靠椅是专定给客人坐的。无论您愿意不愿意——一定要您坐在这里的！”

乞乞科夫坐下了。

“请您许可，我敬您一口烟！”

“不，多谢，我是不吸的！”乞乞科夫殷勤的，而且惋惜似的说。

“为什么不呢？”玛尼罗夫也用了一样殷勤的，而且惋惜的口气问。

“因为没有吸惯，我也怕敢吸惯；人说，吸烟是损害健康的！”

“请您许可我说一点意见，这话是一种偏见。据我看起来，吸烟斗比嗅鼻烟好得多。我们的联队里，有一个中尉，是体面的，很有教育的人物，他可是烟斗不离口的，不但带到食桌上来，说句不雅的话，他还带到别的地方去。他现在已经四十岁了，谢上帝，健康得很。”

乞乞科夫分辩说，这是也可以有的；在自然界中，有许多东西，就是有大智慧的人也不能明白。

“但请您许可我，要请教您一件事……”他用了一种带着奇怪的，或者是近于奇怪模样的调子，说，并且不知道为什么缘故，还向背后看一看。玛尼罗夫也向背后看一看，也说不出为的什么来。“最近一次的户口调查册，您已经送去很久了罢？”

“是的，那已经很久了，我其实也不大记得了。”

“这以后，在您这里，死过许多农奴了罢？”

“这我可不知道；这事得问一问经理。喂！人来！去叫经理来，今天他该是在这里的。”

经理立刻出现了。他是一个四十岁上下的人；刮得精光的下巴，身穿常礼服，看起来总像是过着很舒服的生活，因为那脸孔又圆又胖，黄黄的皮色和一对小眼睛，就表示着他是万分熟悉柔软的毛绒被和毛绒枕头的。只要一看，也就知道他也如一切管理主人财产的奴子一样，走过照例的轨道：最初，他是一个平常的小子，在主人家里长大，学些读书，写字；后来和一个叫作什么亚喀式加之类的结了婚，她是受主妇宠爱的管家，于是自己也变为管家，终于还升了经理。一上经理的新任，那自然也就和一切经理一样：结识些村里的小财主，给他们的儿子做干爹，越发向农奴作威作福，早上九点钟才起床，一直等到煮沸了茶炊，喝茶。

“听哪，我的好人！送出了最末一次的户口调查册以后，我们这里死了多少农奴了？”

“您说什么？多少？这以后，死了许多。”经理说，打着饱嗝，用手遮着嘴，好像一面盾牌。

“对啦，我也这么想，”玛尼罗夫就接下去，“死了许多了！”于是向着乞乞科夫，添上一句道：“真是多得很！”

“譬如，有多少呢？”乞乞科夫问道。

“对啦，有多少呢？”玛尼罗夫接着说。

“是的，怎么说呢——有多少。那可不知道，死了多少，没有人算过。”

“自然。”玛尼罗夫说，便又对乞乞科夫道：“我也这么想，死亡率是很大的；死了多少呢，我们可是一点也不知道。”

“那么，请您算一下，”乞乞科夫说，“并且开给我一张详细的全部的名单。”

“是啦，全部的名单！”玛尼罗夫说。

经理说着“是是！”出去了。

“为了什么缘故，您喜欢知道这些呢？”经理一走，玛尼罗夫就问。

这问题似乎使客人有些为难了，他脸上分明露出紧张的表情来，因此有一点脸红——这表情，是显示着有话要说，却又说不出口的。但是，玛尼罗夫也终于听到非常奇怪，而且人类的耳朵从来没有听到过的东西了。

“您在问我：为什么缘故么？就为了这缘故呀：我要买农奴。”乞乞科夫说，但又吃吃的中止了。

“还请您许可我问一声，”玛尼罗夫说，“您要农奴，是连田地，还是单要他们去，就是不连田地的呢？”

“都不，我并不是要农奴，”乞乞科夫说，“我要那已经……死掉的。”

“什么？请您原谅……我的耳朵不大好，我觉得，我听到了一句非常奇特的话……”

“我要买死掉的农奴，但在最末的户口册上，却还是活着的。”乞乞科夫说明道。

玛尼罗夫把烟斗掉在地板上面了，嘴张得很大，就这样的张着嘴坐了几分钟。刚刚谈着友谊之愉快的这两个朋友，这时是一动不动的彼此凝视着，好像淳厚的古时候，常爱挂在镜子两边的两张像。到底是玛尼罗夫自去拾起烟斗来，趁势从下面望一望他的客人的脸，看他嘴角上可有微笑，还是不过讲笑话：然而全不能发见这些事，倒相反，他的脸竟显得比平常还认真。于是他想，这客人莫非忽然发了疯么，惴惴的留心的看，但他的眼睛却完全澄净，毫没有见于疯子眼里那样狞野的暴躁的闪光：一切都很合法度。玛尼罗夫也想着现在自己应该怎么办，但除了细细的喷出烟头以外，也全想不出什么来。

“其实，我就想请教一下，这些事实上已经死掉，但在法律上却还算活着的魂灵，您可肯让给我或者卖给我呢，或者您还有更好的高见罢。”

但玛尼罗夫却简直发了昏，只是凝视着他，说不出一句话。

“看起来，您好像还有些决不定罢！”乞乞科夫说。

“我……阿，不的，那倒不然，”玛尼罗夫道，“不过我不懂……对不起……我自然没有受过像您那样就在一举一动上，也都看得出来的好教育；也没有善于说话的本领……恐怕……在您刚才见教的说明后面……还藏着……什么别的……恐怕这不过是一种修辞上的词藻，您就爱这么使用使用的罢？”

“阿，并不是的！”乞乞科夫活泼的即刻说。“并不是的，我说的什么话，就是什么意思，我就确是说着事实上已经死掉了的魂灵。”

玛尼罗夫一点也摸不着头脑。他也觉得这时该有一点表示，问乞乞科夫几句，但是问什么呢，却只有鬼知道。他最末找到的惟一的出路，仍旧是喷出烟头来，不过这回是不从嘴巴里，却从鼻孔里了。

“如果这事情没有什么为难，那么，我们就靠上帝保佑，立刻来立买卖合同罢。”乞乞科夫说。

“什么？死魂灵的买卖合同？”

“不的！不这样的！”乞乞科夫回答道。“我们自然说是活的魂灵，全照那登在户口册上的一样。我是无论如何，不肯违反民法的；即使因此在服务上要吃许多苦，也没有别的法；义务，在我是神圣的，至于法律呢……在法律面前，我一声不响。”

最后的一句话，很惬了玛尼罗夫的意了，虽然这件事本身的意思，他还是不能懂；他拼命的吸了几口烟，当作回答，使烟斗开始发出笛子一般的声音。看起来，好像他是以为从烟斗里，可以吸出那未曾前闻的事件的意见来似的，但烟斗却不过嘶嘶的叫，再没有别的了。

“恐怕您还有点怀疑罢？”

“那可没有！一点也没有！请您不要以为对于您的人格，我有……什么批评似的偏见，但是我要提出一个问题来：这计画……或者说得更明白些……是这交易……这交易，结局不至于和民法以及将来的俄国的面子不对么？”

说到这话，玛尼罗夫就活泼的摇一摇头，显着极有深意的样子，看定了乞乞科夫的脸，脸上还全部露出非常恳切的表情来，尤其是在那紧闭了的嘴唇上，这在平常人的脸上，是从来看不到的，除非是一个出类拔萃的精明的国务大臣，但即使他，也得在谈到实在特别困难的问题的时候。

然而乞乞科夫就简单地解释，这样的计画或交易，和民法以及将来的俄国的体面完全不会有什么相反之处，停了一下，他又补足说，国家还因此收入合法的税，对于国库倒是有些好处的。

“那么，您的意见是这样……？”

“我以为这是很好的！”

“哪，如果好，那自然又作别论了。我没有什么反对。”玛尼罗夫说，完全放了心。

“现在我们只要说一说价钱……”

“什么？说价钱？”玛尼罗夫又有些发昏了，说。“您以为我会要魂灵的钱的么……那些已经并不存在了的？如果您在这么想，那我可就要说，是一种任意的幻想，我这一面，是简直奉送，不要报酬，买卖合同费也归我出。”

倘使这件故事的记述者在这里不叙我们的客人当听到玛尼罗夫的这一番话的时候，高兴的了不得，那一定是要大遭物议的。他虽然镇定，深沉，这时却也显出想要山羊似的跳了起来的样子，谁都知道，这是只在最大高兴的发作的时候，才会显出来的。他在靠椅上动得很厉害，连罩在那上面的羽纱都要撕破了；玛尼罗夫也觉得，惊疑的看着他。为了泉涌的感激之诚，这客人便规规矩矩的向他淋下道谢的话去，一直弄到他完全失措，脸红，大摇其头，终于声明了这全不算一件什么事，不过想借此表示一点自己的真心的爱重，和精神的相投——而死掉的魂灵呢——那是不足道的——是纯粹的废物。

“决不是废物。”乞乞科夫说，握着他的手。

他于是吐了很深的一口气。好像他把心里的郁结都出空了；后来还并非没有做作的说出这样的话来：“阿！如果您知道了看去好像琐细的赠品，给了一个无名无位的人，是怎样的有用呵！真的！我什么没有经历过呢！就像孤舟的在惊涛骇浪中……什么迫害我没有熬过呢！什么苦头我没有吃过呢！为什么呢？就因为我忠实于真理，要良心干净，就因为我去帮助无告的寡妇和可怜的孤儿！”这时他竟至于须用手巾，去擦那流了下来的眼泪了。

玛尼罗夫完全被感动了。这两个朋友，继续的握着手，并且许多工夫不说话，彼此看着泪光闪闪的眼睛。玛尼罗夫简直不想把我们的主角的手放开，总是热心的紧握着，至于使他几乎不知道要怎样才可以自由自在。后来他终于温顺的抽回了，他说，如果买卖合同能够赶紧写起来，那就好，如果玛尼罗夫肯亲自送到市里来，就更好；于是拿起自己的帽子，就要告辞了。

“怎么？您就要去了？”玛尼罗夫好像从梦里醒来似的，愕然的问。

这时玛尼罗夫夫人适值走进屋里来。

“丽珊加！”玛尼罗夫显些诉苦一般的脸相，说，“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支要去了哩！”

“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支一定是厌弃了我们了。”玛尼罗夫夫人回答道。

“仁善的夫人！”乞乞科夫说，“这里，您看这里，”——他把手放在心窝上——“是的，这里是记着和您们在一起的愉快的时光的！还要请您相信我，和您们即使不在一所屋子里，至少是住在邻近来过活，在我也就是无上的福气了！”

“真是的，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”玛尼罗夫说，他分明佩服了这意见了。“如果我们能够一起在一个屋顶下过活，在榆树阴下彼此谈论哲学，研究事情，那可真是好透……”

“阿，那就像上了天！”乞乞科夫叹息着说。“再见，仁善的夫人！”他去吻玛尼罗夫夫人的手，接着道：“再见，可敬的朋友！您不要忘记我拜托过您的事呀！”

“呵，您放心就是！”玛尼罗夫回答说。“不必两天，我们一定又会见面的！”

他们跨进了食堂。

“哪，再会再会，我的可爱的孩子！”乞乞科夫一看见绥密斯多克利由斯和亚勒吉特，就说，他们正在玩着一个臂膊和鼻子全都没有了的木制骠骑兵。“再会呀，可爱的孩子们！对不起，我竟没有给你们带一点东西来，但我得声明，我先前简直没有知道你们已经出世了呢。但再来的时候，一定要带点来的。给你是一把指挥刀。你要指挥刀么？怎么样？”

“要的！”绥密斯多克利由斯回答道。

“给你是带一个鼓来。对不对，你是喜欢一个鼓的罢？”乞乞科夫向亚勒吉特弯下身子去，接着说。

“嗡，一个鼓。”亚勒吉特小声说，低了头。

“很好，那么，我就给你买一个鼓来。——你知道，那是一个很好的鼓呵——敲起来它就总是蓬的……蓬……咚的，咚，咚，咚的，咚，咚。再见，小宝贝！再会了呀！”他在他们头上接一个吻，转过来对玛尼罗夫和他的夫人微微一笑，如果要表示自己觉得他们的孩子们的希望，是多么天真烂漫，那么，对着那些父母是一定用这种笑法的。

“唉唉，您还是停一会罢，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”当大家已经走到阶沿的时候，玛尼罗夫说。“您看呀，那边上了多少云！”

“那不过是些小云片。”乞乞科夫道。

“但是您知道到梭巴开维支那里去的路么？”

“这正要请教您呢。”

“请您许可，我说给您的马夫去！”玛尼罗夫于是很客气的把走法告诉了马夫，其间他还称了一回“您”。

马夫听了教他通过两条十字路，到第三条，这才转弯的时候，就说：“找得到的了，老爷。”于是乞乞科夫也在踮着脚尖，摇着手巾的夫妇俩的送别里，走掉了。

玛尼罗夫还在阶沿上站得很久，目送着渐渐远去的马车，直到这早已望不见了，他却依然衔着烟斗，站在那里。后来总算回进屋子里去了，在椅子上坐下，想着自己已经给了他的客人一点小小的满足，心里很高兴。他的思想又不知不觉的移到别的事情上面去，只有上帝才知道要拉到那里为止。他想着友谊的幸福，倘在河滨上和朋友一起过活，可多么有趣呢，于是他在思想上就在这河边造一座桥，又造一所房子，有一个高的眺望台的，从此可以看见莫斯科的全景，他又想到夜里在户外的空旷处喝茶，谈论些有味的事情，这才该是愉快得很；并且设想着和乞乞科夫一同坐了漂亮的篷车，去赴一个夜会，他们的应对态度之好，使赴会者都神迷意荡，终于连皇帝也知道了他们俩的友谊，赏给他们每人一个将军衔，他就这样的梦下去；后来呢，只有天晓得，连他自己也不十分清楚了。但乞乞科夫的奇怪的请求，忽然冲进了他的梦境，却还是猜不出那意思来：他翻来复去的想，要知道得多一些，然而到底不明白。他衔着烟斗，这样的还坐了很多的时光，一直到晚膳摆在桌子上。

第三章


这时候，乞乞科夫是很愉快的坐在他那皮篷马车里，已经在村路上走了许多工夫了。他的趣味和嗜好的主要对象是什么，我们是从第二章早就明白了的，所以他把肉体和心灵都化在这上面，也看得毫不觉到奇怪。从他那显在脸上的表情看起来，那推测，那估量，那计画，都好像很得意，因为他总在露出些满足的微笑来。他尽在想着那些事，而对于他那受了玛尼罗夫家的仆役的款待，弄得飘飘然了的马夫，可曾注意着右边的花马，却一点也没有留心。这花马很狡猾，当中间的青马和左边的那匹因为从一个议员买来，名字就叫“议员”的枣骝，都在使劲的前进的时候，它却只装作好像也在拉车模样。那两匹马，却因为自己这样的卖力，人可以从眼睛里看出它们的满足来。“你尽量的刁罢！没有好处的！我还要使你刁些呢！”绥里方说着，略略欠起身子来，给了懒马一鞭子。“要守本分，你这废料……！阿青……是好马，它肯尽职；我也要多给它些草料的，因为它是好马。议员呢——也是一匹好马……喂，你摇耳朵干什么？昏蛋，人对你讲话，你要留心！我不会教你坏道的，你这驴子！好罢，随便你跑！”于是他又给了一鞭子，唠叨道：“哼！野蛮！拿破仑，该死的东西！”接着是向它们一起大声的叫道：“喂！心肝宝贝！”并且给三匹都吃了一鞭子，不过这并非责罚，乃是他中意它们了的表示。他把这小高兴分给它们之后，又向着花马道：“你当作对我玩些花样，我会看不出你坏处来的罢。这不成的，我的宝贝，如果想人尊敬你，你得规规矩矩的做。你瞧！刚才的老爷府上的人们——那是好人！我只喜欢和好人谈天，好人——是我的朋友，也是好伙计；我喜欢和他同桌吃饭，或者喝一杯茶。好人是谁都尊敬的！比如我们的老爷——谁都尊敬他，你好好的听着罢，就因为他肯给我们的皇上尽力，又是个六等官呀……”

绥里方这样的想开去，一直跑到最飘渺，最玄妙的事情上去了。假如乞乞科夫留心的听一下，是可以明白关于他本身的许多仔细的；但他的思想，都用在自己的计算上，待到一声霹雳，这才使他从梦中惊醒，向周围看了一看；空中已经密布了云，大雨点打在烟尘陡乱的驿路上。接着一个又是一个更近的更响的霹雳，雨就倾盆似的倒了下来。对于车篷，开初是横打的，忽然从这边，忽然从那边，接着又改换了攻击法，打鼓似的向篷顶上直淋，弄到水点都溅到乞乞科夫的脸上。他只好放下皮帘，遮住了原是开着以便赏鉴风景的小圆窗，一面叫绥里方赶快走。绥里方被打断了讲演，也知道这不再是迁延的时候了，便从马夫台下，拉出一件青布的外套似的东西来，两手向袖子里一套，抓住缰绳，向着那听了他的讲演，觉得愉快的疲劳，正在踉踉跄跄的三匹牲口，发一声喊。不过已经走过了两条岔路，还是三条呢，却连绥里方自己也弄不明白了。他想了一通之后，就随随便便的定为确已走过了许多十字路。凡俄国人，一到紧要关头，是总归不肯深思远虑，只想寻一条出路的，他也这样，到了其次的岔路，便向右一弯，对马匹叫道：“喂，好朋友，走好哪！”一面赶着它们开快步，至于顺着这条路走到那里去呢，他可是并没有怎么想过的。

雨好像并不想就住。盖在村路上的灰尘，一下子就化了泥浆，马匹的拉车越来越艰难了。梭巴开维支的村庄，还是望不见，乞乞科夫觉得很焦急。照他的计算，是早该走到了的。他从窗洞里向两面探望，然而漆黑一团，什么也看不见。

“绥里方！”他终于从窗口伸出头去，叫了起来。

“什么事呀，老爷？”绥里方回答说。

“你瞧罢；村子还看不见呢！”

“对了，老爷，还看不见呢！”于是绥里方挥着鞭子，唱起歌似的东西来了。说这是歌，是不可以的，因为很散漫，而且长到无穷无尽。绥里方把一切都放进那里面去，全俄国的马夫对马所用的称赞语和吆喝声，还有随手牵来，随口说出的一切种类的形容词。到后来，他竟拉得更远，至于称他的牲口为“书记”了。

但乞乞科夫现在却发见了他的车在左右摇动，每一摇动，就给他很有力的一震；使他想到这好像已经离开道路，拉到耕过的田里来了。绥里方大约也觉得的，然而他一声不响。

“你究竟在怎样的路上走呀，你这流氓？”乞乞科夫喊道。

“有什么法子呢，我的老爷，已经晚上了。我是连我的鞭子也看不见呢，就这么漆黑！”正说着这话，马车就向一旁直歪过去了，至于使乞乞科夫得用两只手使劲的攀住。他这才看出，绥里方是喝得烂醉的。

“停下来！停下来！你要摔出我去了！”他向他叫喊。

“不会的，我的老爷，您怎么会想到我要摔出您去呢。”绥里方说。“如果这样，可就坏了，那我自己也知道；唔，不会的，无论怎样，我不会摔出您去的！”他这时就把马车拉转来，车转得很缓，可是终于全部翻倒了。乞乞科夫爬在泥浆里。绥里方是在拉住马；但马也好像自己站住了似的，因为正疲乏得要命。这意外的大事件使绥里方没了办法。他爬下马夫台，两手叉腰，对马车站着，当他的主人在泥浆里打滚，挣扎着想要站起来的时候，就说道：“这东西可到底翻倒了！”

“你醉得像猪一样！”乞乞科夫说。

“没有的事，我的老爷！我怎么会喝醉呢！我知道的，喝醉，是坏事情。我不过和一个好朋友谈了些闲天；和一个好人，是可以谈谈的——这不算坏事情——后来我们就一起吃了饭。这也没有什么不对——和一个好人吃一点东西。”

“你前回喝醉了的时候，我怎么对你说的，唔？你又忘记了么？”乞乞科夫说。

“一点也没有，您好老爷，我怎样能忘记呢？我知道我的本分！我知道喝醉是很不对的。我不过和体面人谈了些天，这可不算……”

“我要用鞭子狠抽你一顿，那你就明白了，什么叫作和体面人谈天……”

“随您好老爷的高兴。”绥里方完全满足了，回答道。“如果要给鞭子，那很好，我是没有贰话的。如果做了该吃鞭子的事，怎么可以不给鞭子呢；这全都随您的便，您是主子呀！农奴是应该给点鞭子的，要不然，就不听话。规矩总得有。如果我闹出事来，那么，抽我一顿就是了，怎么可以不给鞭子呢？”

对于这样的一种深思熟虑，乞乞科夫竟想不出回答来。但在这时候，好像运命也发了慈悲了。忽然间，远远的听到了狗叫。乞乞科夫高兴极了，就命令绥里方出发，并且叫他用了全速力的走。俄国的马夫是有一种微妙的本能的，可以用不着眼睛；所以他即使合了眼，飞快的跑，也会跑到一处什么目的地。绥里方虽然看不见东西，却放马一直向着村子冲过去，待到车棒碰着了篱垣，简直再没有可走的路，这才停下来。乞乞科夫只能在极密的烟雨中，看见了像是屋顶的一片。他便叫绥里方去寻大门，假使俄国不用恶狗来代管门人，发出令人不禁用手掩住耳朵的大声，报告着大门的所在，那一定是寻得很费工夫的。窗户里漏着一点光，这微明也落到篱垣上，向我们的旅客通知了走向大门的路径。绥里方去一敲，不多久，角门开处，就现出一个披着睡衣的人影来。主仆两个，也听到对他们嚷叫的发沙的女人声音了：“谁敲门呀？谁在这里逛荡呀？”

“我们是旅客，妈妈，我们在寻一个过夜的地方。”乞乞科夫说。

“是么？真莽撞！”那老婆子唠叨着。“来得这么迟。这儿不是客店。这儿是住着一位地主太太的。”

“叫我怎么办呢，妈妈？我们迷了路了。这样的天气，我们又不能在露天下过夜。”

“真的，天是又暗，又坏。”绥里方提醒道。

“不要你说，驴子！”乞乞科夫说。

“您是什么人呀？”那老婆子问。

“是一个贵族，妈妈。”

贵族这句话，好像把老婆子有些打动了。“等一等，我禀太太去。”她低声说着，进去了，两分钟之后，又走出来，手里提着一个风灯。大门开开了。这回是别的窗子里也有了亮光。马车拉进了大门，停在一所小小的屋子的前面。这屋子在黑暗里，很不容易看得明白，只有一边照着些从窗子里射出来的光；屋前还有一个水洼，灯光也映在这上面。大雨潺潺的注在木屋顶上，又像溪流似的落在下面的水桶中。狗儿们发着各色各样的叫声：一匹昂着头，发出拉长的幽婉的声音，它怀着一种热心，仿佛想得什么奖赏；别一匹却像教会里的唱歌队一样，立刻接下去了；夹在中间，恰如邮车的铃铛一般响亮的，是大约还是小狗的最高音，最后压倒全部合奏的是具有坚定的，狗式的，大约乃是老狗的最低音，因为合奏一到顶点，它就像最低弦乐器似的拼命的叫起来了；中音歌手们都踮起脚趾，想更好的唱出高声来，大家也都伸长了颈子，放开了喉咙；独有它，它最低弦乐演奏者，却把没有修剃的下巴藏在领子里，蹲着，膝髁几乎要着地，忽然从这里起了吓人的声音，使所有的窗玻璃都因此发了响，发了抖。只要听到这样音乐似的各种的狗叫，原是就可以知道这村子是很体面的；但我们的半冻而全湿的主角，却除了温暖的眠床之外，什么也不理会。马车刚要停下，他跳出来，一绊，几乎倒在阶沿上了。这时门口又出现了别一个女人，比先前的年青些，然而模样很相像。她领乞乞科夫走进屋里去。经过这里，他就瞥了一眼屋子的内部：屋子是糊着旧的花条的壁纸的；壁上挂着几幅画，一律是花鸟，窗户之间挂有小小的古风的镜子，昏暗的镜框上都刻着卷叶。镜子后面塞着些信札，旧的纸牌，袜子，或者诸如此类；还有一口指针盘上描花的挂钟……这些之外，乞乞科夫就什么也没有看到了。他觉得他的眼睑要粘起来，仿佛有谁给涂上了蜂蜜一样。再过了几分钟，主妇出现了，是一位老太太，戴着睡帽，可见她是匆匆忙忙的走出来的，颈子上还围着一条弗兰绒的领巾。这位婆婆，是小地主太太们中的一个，如果没收成，受损失，是要悲叹，颓唐的，然而一面也悄悄的，即使是慢慢的，总把现钱一个一个的弄到藏在她柜子的抽屉里的花麻布钱包里面去。一个钱包装卢布，别一个装五十戈贝克，第三个装二十五戈贝克的现货，但看起来，却好像柜子里面，除了衬衣，睡衣，线团，拆开的罩衫之外，什么也没有似的。假使因为过节，烤着酪饼和姜饼的时候，旧的给烧破了，或者自然穿破了，这拆开的就要改作新的用。如果衣服没有烧破，也还很可以穿呢，我们的省俭的老太太大约还要使这罩衫拆开着躺在抽屉里，终于和许多别样的旧货，由她的遗嘱传授给那里的一位平辈亲戚或者外甥侄子的。

乞乞科夫首先告罪，说是为了他突然的登门，惊动了她了。“不要紧，不要紧！”那主妇说。“上帝竟教您来得这么晚！又是这样的大风雨！走了这么远的路，本应该请您用点什么的，可是在这样的深夜里，我实在不能豫备了！”

一种奇特的骚扰打断了主妇的话，乞乞科夫很吃了一吓。这骚扰也像忽然之间，屋子里充满了蛇一样；但抬眼一看，也就完全安静了；他知道，这是挂钟快要敲打时候的声音。接着这骚扰，又发出一种沙声来，到底是敲起来了，聚了所有的力量，两点钟，那声音仿佛是谁拿了棍子，敲着一个开裂的壶，于是钟摆又平稳下去了，从新来来往往的摆着。

乞乞科夫向主妇致谢，并且声明自己一无所需，请她不要抱歉，除了一张眠床之外，他是什么也不希望了的。这时他想问明，他究竟错走到什么地方来了，到梭巴开维支先生的村庄去，还有多少远，但那老太太的回答，却道是她从来没有听到过这姓名，姓这的地主，是那里也没有的。

“那么，玛尼罗夫，您许是知道的罢？”乞乞科夫问。

“那是怎样的人呀，玛尼罗夫？”

“是一个地主，太太。”

“没有，我从来没有听到过他的姓名，没有这么一个地主的。”

“那么，这里的地主全是些什么人呢？”

“皤勃罗夫，斯惠宁，卡拉派且夫，哈尔巴庚，忒累巴庚，泼来卡科夫。”

“都有钱没有呢？”

“没有，先生，这里是没有什么有钱人的。不过这有二十个，那有三十个魂灵罢了；有着百来个魂灵的人，这里是没有的。”

乞乞科夫这才明白，他竟错走到这样的穷乡僻壤来了。

“那么，您可以告诉我，从这儿到市上去有多么远吗？”

“总该有六十维尔斯他罢。我真简慢了客人，竟什么也不能请您吃！您高兴喝一杯茶么，先生？”

“多谢得很，太太。我只要有一张床，就尽够了。”

“是呀，真的呢，走了这么多的路，是要歇一歇的。请您躺在这张沙发上面罢，先生。喂！菲替涅，拿一床垫被，一个枕头和一条手巾来！天哪，这样的天气！就像怪风雨呀！我这里是整夜的在圣像面前点着蜡烛哩。阿呀，我的上帝，您的背后和一边，都龌龊得像野猪一样了。这是在哪里弄得这么脏的呢？”

“谢谢上帝，我不过弄得这么脏；没有折断了脊梁，可还要算是运气的！”

“神圣的耶稣，您在说什么呀？您可愿意给您的背后刷一下呢？”

“不不，多谢您！请您不要费心！还是请您吩咐您的使女，拿我的衣服去烘一烘，刷一下罢！”

“听着呀，菲替涅！”那使女已经拿了灯走上阶沿，搬进垫被来，并且用两手一抖，绒毛的云便飞得满屋，主妇于是转过脸去，对她说道，“拿上衣和外套去，在火上烘一烘，就像老爷在着那时候的那样子做，以后就拍一拍，刷它一个干净。”

“明白了，太太！”菲替涅在垫被上铺上布单，放好两个枕头，一面说。

“哦，床算是铺好了！”主妇说。“请安置罢，先生，好好的睡！您可还要什么不？也许惯常是要有人捏捏脚后跟的罢。先夫在着的时候，不捏，可简直是睡不着的。”

然而客人又辞谢了这享乐。主妇一出去，他连忙脱下衣服来。把全副披挂，从上到下，都交给了菲替涅，她说过晚安，带着湿淋淋的收获，走掉了。当他只剩了独自一个的时候。就颇为满足的来看他那快要碰着天花板的眠床。他摆好一把椅子，踏着爬上眠床去，垫被也跟着他低下去，快要碰到地板，从绽缝里挤了出来的绒毛，又各到各处，飞满了一屋子。他熄了灯，拉上羽纱被来蒙着头，蜷得像圆面包一样，一下子就睡着了。到第二天，他醒得不很早。太阳透过窗子，直射在他脸上，昨夜静静的睡在墙壁和天花板上的苍蝇，现在却向他集中了它们全部的注意：一匹坐在下唇上，别一匹站在耳朵上，第三匹又想跑到眼睛这里来；还有胡里胡涂的一匹，竟在鼻孔边占了地盘，他在半睡半醒中，一吸，就吸进鼻子里去了，自然是惹他打一个大喷嚏——但也因此使他醒转了。他向屋子里一瞥，这才知道挂在壁上的原来也并非全是花鸟图，他又看见一张库土梭夫(1)的肖像和一幅油画，上面是一个老人，穿着像是保惠尔·彼得洛维支(2)时代的红色袖口的制服。挂钟又骚扰起来了，打了九点钟；一个女人的头在门口一探，立刻又消失了，因为乞乞科夫想要睡得熟，是全脱了他的衣服的。这一探的脸，他觉得有点认识，他要记出这究竟是谁来，终于明白了可就是这家的主妇。他连忙穿起小衫来，衣服就放在他旁边，燥了，还刷得很干净。于是他穿好外衣，走到镜子前面，大声的又打一个嚏，打得恰恰走近窗口来的火鸡——那窗门原也比地面高不了多少——也大声的啯啯的叫了起来，还用它那奇特的话，极快的向他说了些什么，那意思，总归好像说是“恭喜”似的，乞乞科夫就回答它一句“昏蛋”。之后，他走向窗前，去观察一下四近；从窗口所见，仿佛都是养鸡场；因为在他眼前的，至少，是凡有又小又窄的院子中，满是家禽和别样的家畜。无数的公鸡和火鸡在那里奔走；其间有一匹公鸡跨开高傲的方步，摇着鸡冠，侧着脑袋，好像它正在倾听什么似的。猪的一家也混在这里面；老母猪在掘垃圾堆，也似乎兼顾着小猪仔，但到底完全忘记，自去大嚼那散在地上的西瓜皮去了。这小院子或是养鸡场，是用板壁围起来的，外面是一大片菜园，种着卷心莱，葱，马铃薯，甜菜和别样的蔬菜。菜园里面，又处处看见苹果树和别的果子树，上面蒙起网来，防着喜鹊和麻雀。尤其是麻雀，成着大群，飞来飞去，简直像斜挂的云一样。因此还有许多吓鸟的草人，都擎在长竿上，伸开了臂膊；有一个还戴着这家的主妇的旧头巾。菜园后面是农奴的小屋子，位置很凌乱，也不成为有空场和通路的排列，但由乞乞科夫看来，那居民们的生活是要算好的：屋顶板一旧，就都换上新的了，也看不见一扇倒坏的门，向这边开口的仓库里，有的是一辆豫备的货车，有时还有二辆。“哼！这小村子可也并不怎么小哩！”他自言自语的说，并且立刻打定主意，要和主妇去扳谈，好打交道了。他从她先前探进头来的门缝里向外一望，看见她在喝茶，就装着高兴而且和气的模样走过去。

“日安，先生！您睡得怎么样？”那主妇说着，站了起来。她比昨夜穿得阔绰了，头上已不戴睡帽，换了黑色的头巾。颈子上却还是围着什么一些物事。

“很好的，好极了，”乞乞科夫一面说，一面坐在靠椅上，“您呢，太太？”

“不行呀，先生！”

“这是怎么的呢？”

“睡不着呀。腰痛，腿痛，连脚跟都痛。”

“就会好的，太太，您不要愁。”

“但愿就会好呵。猪油呀，松节油呀，我都擦过了。您用什么兑茶呢？这个瓶子里的是果子汁。”

“很好，太太。就是果子汁罢。”

大约读者也已经觉到，乞乞科夫虽然表示着殷勤的态度，但比起在玛尼罗夫家来，却随便说话，没有拘束得远了。这里应该说明的，是有许多节目，俄国固然赶不上外国，但善于交际，外国人却也远不及我们。我们的交际样式上的许多精微和层次，是简直数也数不清的。一个法国人或德国人，一生一世也不会懂得我们的举动的奇特和差别；他们对一个富翁和一个香烟小贩说话，所用的几乎是一样的调子，一样的声音，纵使他们的心里，对于富翁也佩服之至。我们这里可是完全不同了：我们有这样的艺术家，对着蓄有二百个魂灵的地主说话，和对那蓄有三百个的全两样；但对他说话，又和蓄有五百个的全两样；而和他说起来，又和对于蓄有八百个魂灵的地主全两样；就是增到一百万也不要紧，各有各的说法。我们来举一个例罢，这并非我们这里，乃是一个很远的王国的什么地方，这地方有一个衙门，又假如这衙门里有一位长官或是所长。当他坐在中间，围绕着他的属员们的时候，我要请读者仔细的看一看——我相信，你们就要吓得说不出话来了。威严，清高——有什么还不显在他顾盼之间呢？倘要拿了画笔，画出他来，给他留下这相貌，那简直是普洛美修斯(3)！一点不差：一个普洛美修斯！他老雕似的看，他的步子是柔软，镇定，而且稳当。但你们看着这老雕罢，他一出大厅，走近他的上司的屋子去，可就不大能够认识了；他紧紧的挟着公文夹，逃跑的鹁鸪似的急急的走过去，几乎要失了魂。倘到一个俱乐部，或者赴一个夜会，如果都是职位较低的人们，那么，我们的普洛美修斯是仍不失为真正普洛美修斯的，但只要有一个人，比他大一点，我们的普洛美修斯可就要起一种连渥辟提乌斯(4)也梦想不到的变化：比苍蝇还要小，他简直化为几乎没有，一粒微乎其微的尘沙了！“然而这岂不是伊凡·彼得洛维支吗？”有人看见了他，就会说，“伊凡·彼得洛维支还要高大些，这人却很小，又很瘦；他总用大声说话，也总不笑的，但这人，哼，却小鸟儿似的啾啾唧唧，而且总在陪笑哩。”然而走近去仔细一看——也还是伊凡·彼得洛维支！“阿呀，这样。”人就对自己说……然而我们还是再讲这里的登场人物罢。我们知道，乞乞科夫是已经决定，不再客气了；他于是拿了一杯茶，加一点果子汁，谈起来道：

“您的村庄可真的出色呵，太太。魂灵有多少呢？”

“到不了八十，”那主妇说，“可惜我们光碰着这样的坏年头；去年又来了一个歉收，连上帝都要发慈悲的！”

“可是农奴却都显得活泼，屋子也像样。但我想请教您：您贵姓呀？昨天到得太晚，忙昏了……”

“科罗皤契加(5)，十等官夫人。”

“多谢。还有您的本名和父称呢？”

“那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜。”

“那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜么？高雅得很！——那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜。我有一个嫡亲的姨母，是家母的姊妹，也叫那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜。”

“可是您的贵姓是什么呢？”地主太太问。“您是税务官罢？不是的？”

“不是的，太太，”乞乞科夫微笑着回答道，“我不是税务官，我在外面走，只为着自己的事情。”

“那么，您是经手人？多么可惜！我把我的蜂蜜都贱卖了；您一定是要的，先生，可对？”

“不，我不大收买过蜂蜜。”

“那就是什么别样的东西。要麻罢？我现在可实在还不多——至多半普特(6)。”

“唉！不的，太太，我要的是别样的货色，请您告诉我，您这里可死了许多农奴没有呢？”

“唉唉！先生，十八个！”那老人叹息着，说。“还都是很出色，会做事的。自然也有些在大起来，可是有什么用呢，毫没力气的家伙，税务官一到，却每个魂灵的税都要收。他们已经死掉了，还得替他们付钱。上礼拜里，我这里烧死了一个铁匠，一个很有本领的铁匠！也知道做铜匠手艺的。”

“莫非这村子里失了火吗，太太？”

“谢上帝不给有这样的灾殃！如果是火灾，那可就更坏了。并不是的，他全由自己烧死的。火是从他里面的什么地方烧出来的；他真也喝的太多了，人只看见好像一道青烟，他就这么的焦掉了，一直到乌黑的像一块炭；唉唉，是一个很有本领的铁匠呢。我现在简直全不能坐车出去了。这里就再没有人会钉马掌。”

“这是上帝的意志呵，太太，”乞乞科夫叹息着说，“违背上帝的意思的事，人是唠叨不得的。您知道不？您肯把他们让给我吗，那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜？”

“让什么呀，先生？”

“唔，就是所有的那些人，那已经死掉了的。”

“我怎么能把他们让给您呢！”

“唔，那很容易。或者我问您买也可以。我付给您钱。”

“但是，怎么办呢？我实在还不懂您。您想把他们从土里刨出来吗？”

乞乞科夫知道这老婆子弄错了目标，必须将事情解释给她听。于是用简单的几句话，说明了这所谓让与或交易，不过是纸面上的事，而且魂灵还要算是活着的。

“但是，您拿他们做什么用呢？”老婆子说，诧异地凝视着他。

“这是我的事情了！”

“但他们是死了的呀！”

“当然，谁说他们是活的呢？正因为他们是死了的，所以使您吃亏。您仍旧要付人头税，我就想替您去掉这担子和麻烦呵；现在懂了没有？不但去掉，我并且还要付您五个卢布呢。您现在明白了罢？”

“我还是不明白，”那老婆子踌蹰着，说，“我向来没有卖过死人。”

“这有什么稀奇！如果您卖过了，这才稀奇哩。您莫非以为这真的值钱的吗？”

“不不，我自然并不这么想。这怎么会值钱呢？已经什么用处也没有了的！但使我担心的，却是他们已经死掉了的这一点。”

“这女人可真的是胡涂，”乞乞科夫想，“您听我说，太太，您再想一想罢！像他们还是活着一样，付出人头税去，这是您的很大的损失呀。”

“阿呀，先生，再也不要提了，”地主太太打断他的话，“三礼拜前，我就又缴了一百五十卢布，还要应酬税务官。”

“您瞧罢，太太，您再想想看，从此您就用不着应酬税务官了，因为纳税的是我，不是您了。全副担子我挑了去，连税契的经费也归我出。您明白了罢！”

主妇沉思了，她觉得这交易也并不坏，不过太新鲜，太古怪，也恐怕买主会给她上一个大当。他从那里来的呢，只有上帝知道，况且又到的这么半夜三更。

“那么，您可以了罢，太太。”乞乞科夫说。

“老实说，先生，我可向来没有卖过死人。活人呢，那是有过的，还在三年前，我把两个娃儿让给了泼罗多波波夫，一百卢布一个，他高兴得很。那都是很能做事的。她们连饭单也会织的。”

“现在说的可不是活人呀！上帝在上！我要的是死人！”

“老实说，我首先就怕会吃亏呢。你到底还是瞒着我；先生，也许他们是……他们的价钱还要贵得远的。”

“您听我说，太太……您在想什么呀！他们怎么会值钱；您想想看！这是废料呀！您要知道，是毫没用处的废料呀！譬如您得了旧货，我们来说破布片罢：那自然是还值些钱的，纸厂还会来买它。然而他们，却什么用也没有了！好，请您自己说，他们还有什么用！”

“那是一点不错的！自然什么用也没有。但使我担心的，也就是他们已经死掉了的这一点呵。”

“我的上帝，这真是一匹胡涂虫，”乞乞科夫忍耐不住了，对着自己说。“总得说伏她。真的，我弄得出汗了！这该死的老家伙！”于是他从衣袋里掏出手帕来，在额上拭着汗。但乞乞科夫的懊恼是没有道理的。即使是阔人，尤其是官员，如果和他们一接近，就知道关于这些事，就和科罗皤契加一式一样。一在脑袋里打定了什么主意之后，你就是用十匹马也拉它不转。无论怎样抗辩，都没有用。纵使说得大白天一样明明白白，也总像橡皮球碰着石墙壁似的弹回来了。乞乞科夫拭过汗，就又想，用了别样的方法，来打动她试试看。

“太太，”他说，“您是不管我说什么，还是只顾自己说什么呢……我付您钱，十五卢布的钞票；您懂了没有？这是钱呀，路上是不会撒着的。比方您卖出蜂蜜去，什么价钱呢？请您说一句罢！”

“一普特十二个卢布。”

“您不要造孽，太太！您没有卖到十二个卢布的。”

“真的，先生！”

“现在您看，这是蜂蜜呀。到您能够采取它，恐怕要费一个年头，一整年的心计，辛苦和手脚的。马车载着到各处走，保护那可怜的蜂儿。一冬天还得藏在窖子里。您瞧就是！但死魂灵，却是不在这世界上的了。您并没有吃辛苦，费手脚。他们的离开这世界，给您的府上有损失，都是上帝的意志。那一面，十二个卢布是您一切心计和辛苦的报酬，而这一面，您什么力气也不化，进益却不止十二个，倒是十五个卢布，而且并非银的，却是很好看的滴蓝的钞票哩。”乞乞科夫用这么强有力而且发人深省的道理，上了战场之后，他以为这老婆子的终于降伏，大约是可以无疑的了。

“一点不错，”那地主太太说，“我是一个可怜的不懂世故的寡妇，还是再等一下，等有别的买主到这里来罢。我也可以比一比价钱。”

“不要闹笑话，太太！您自己想想看，您在说什么了。谁会来买这东西呢。他要这做什么用呢？”

“也许凑巧可以用在家务上的呵……”老婆子反对道。——但她没有说完话，张开嘴巴，吃惊的看定他，紧张着在等候回答。

“死人用在家务上——我的上帝，您真的不知道想到那里去了！莫非在您的菜园里，到夜里好吓雀子吗？！对不对？”

“神圣的耶稣，救救我们罢！你说着多么可怕的话呀。”那老婆子说，画了一个十字。

“另外还有什么用呢？坟和骨头，还是您的。这买卖不过是纸面上的事。究竟怎么样？您至少总得回答我一句。”

那老婆子又沉思起来了。

“您只在想些什么呀，那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜？”

“我可真不知道我该怎么办才是哩。您还不如买点麻去罢！”

“什么，麻！谢谢您！我要的是别的东西，您却拿您的麻来噜苏。给麻静静的麻它的去罢！如果我下一次来拜访，恐怕要买麻也难说的。那么，怎么样呢，那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜？”

“上帝知道，这真是古怪透顶的货色，我向来没有经手过的。”

这时候，乞乞科夫再也忍耐不住了，他愤愤的抓起一把椅子，在地板上一顿，并且诅咒她遭着恶鬼。

说到恶鬼，地主太太就怕得要命。

“阿呀呀，不要提它了！上帝也在的！”她脸色发青，叫喊说。“就在两三天前的夜里，我梦里总是看见它，看见这地狱胚子。祷告之后，我卜了一回牌，可确是上帝差来罚我的呀。它的模样真可怕。它的角，比公牛的还长。”

“我希望您不至于看见一打！我还不及真正的基督教徒的博爱；我一看见一个可怜的寡妇没处安身，没法生活……那还是和你的田地都完结罢。”

“阿呀呀，你在这里说着多么怕人的话呀。”老婆子惴惴的看定他，说。

“真的，没有别的话好说了，简直没有——您不要怪我说的直白——就像一匹锁住的狗，躺在干草上；自己不吃草，却又不肯交给谁。您田地里的所有的出产，我都要买，因为我是也在办差的……”这里他顺便撒了一点谎，并不希望好处的，然而很有效。

这“办差”的话，给了那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜一个深的印象了；她说话，几乎用了恳求的声音：“为什么你就立刻生气呢？要是我早知道你这么暴躁，我倒不如不要回嘴的好了。”

“那里那里，我全没有生气呀！所有的事情比不上一个挤过汁的柠檬。我会气恼吗？”

“好咧，好咧。我拿十五卢布钞票把他们让给你就是。不过有一件事，先生，办差的时候不要忘记我，如果你要麦呀，荞麦粉呀，压碎麦子呀，或是肉类的话。”

“不会不会，太太，我再也不会忘记你了的。”他一面用手擦着三条小河似的，流下他脸孔来的汗，一面说。他还讯问，她在市里可有一个在法院里的密友，全权代理或相识者，可以办妥那订立合同和一切其余的必要的例规的人。“有的，那住持，希理耳神甫；他的儿子是在法院里的。”科罗皤契加说。乞乞科夫就托她寄一封委托书去，还至于自己来起草稿，省得老婆子写些无用的费话。

“如果他给上司买我一点面粉或是家畜，”科罗皤契加其时想，“那就好了。我应该应酬他一下。昨晚上还剩着一点蛋面。我还是去吩咐菲替涅烤蛋饼罢。用奶油面来做鸡蛋馒头，倒也不坏。这我做得好，也用不着多少时光。”于是主妇走了出去，实行馒头计画去了，并且好像还要添上家庭烹调法上的另外几样。但乞乞科夫却因为去取提箱里的纸，走进了他睡过一夜的客厅。屋子早已打扫好，胖胖的毛绒被和垫被，已经搬走了。沙发前面放着一张盖了罩布的桌子。他提箱搁在桌子上，自己坐在沙发上，想休息一下；因为他觉得，自己满身是汗了：凡有他穿在身上的，从小衫到袜子，完全稀湿。“苦够我了，这该死的老货。”他说，休息了一会之后，就开开提箱来。

作者知道，许多读者们是爱新奇，很愿意明白提箱的构造和装着的东西的。那可以，我为什么不给满足一下这好奇心呢。总之，里面是这样子：中间一个肥皂盒；肥皂盒旁边有狭狭的六七格，可以放剃刀。其次是两个放沙粉盒和墨水瓶的方格。两格之间有一条深沟，是装羽毛笔，封信蜡和长的物事的。还有一些有盖和没有盖的格子，为装短的物事，如拜客名片，送葬名片，戏园门票以及留作纪念的别的各种票子之用。抽出上面的抽屉来也有许多格子。其中的一个很宽大，藏着裁开了的许多纸。还有一个做在旁边的秘密的小抽屉，可以暗暗的抽出来，乞乞科夫的钱就总藏在这里面。这小抽屉，他总是飞快的抽开，同时又飞快的关上的，所以他究竟有多少钱呢，无从明白。乞乞科夫马上动手，削好笔尖，写起来了。这时候，主妇也走进屋里来。

“你的箱子可真好哪，先生！”她说着，在旁边坐下了，“你一定是在莫斯科买的罢？”

“对了，在莫斯科。”乞乞科夫回答着，仍然写。

“我知道，在那边买来的都是好的。两年以前，我的姊妹从那边带了一双孩子穿的暖和的长靴来。真好货色！不会破！她现在还穿着呢。阿呀，你有这许多印花。”她向提箱里看了一眼，就说。而实际上，也确有很多的印花在里面。“你送我一两张罢。我没有这东西。有时是得向法院去上呈文的。可总是没有印花。”

乞乞科夫向她解释，这并不是她所意料那样的印花。这是只用于买卖契约的，声请书上就不能用。但为了省得麻烦，他仍然送了她一张值一卢布的物事。写好信件之后，他就请她签名，并且要看农奴们的名单。但这位地主太太却好像全无她自己的农奴们的册子，倒是暗记在心里的。他催她说，自己来抄。有些姓，尤其是诨名，使他非常诧异，至于正在抄录的时候，一听到就得暂时停下来。给他一个特别的印象的是彼得·萨惠略夫·内乌伐柴衣-科卢以多(7)，使他不禁叫了起来道：“好长的名字！”有一个名叫科罗符衣·启尔辟支(8)，别一个却只简截的叫科娄维·伊凡(9)。他抄完之后，用鼻子深深的吸了一口气，就嗅出奶油煎炒的食物的香味来。

“请您用一点罢。”主妇说。乞乞科夫回顾时，看见了摆满着美味的食品的桌子；有香菇，有烙饼，有蛋糕，有蒸饼，有酪条，有脆饼和烘糕，以及各式各样的包子：大葱包子，芥末包子，凝乳包子，白鱼包子，还有莫名其妙的许许多。

“请呀，这是奶油煎过的蛋糕，也许还可以罢？”那主妇说。

乞乞科夫抓过那奶油煎过的蛋糕来，没有吃到一半，就极口称赞起来了。在实际上，蛋糕本身固然并不坏；但当和老婆子使尽力气和转战沙场之后，也觉得格外可口了。

“您不用蒸饼么？”那主妇说。作为这一个问题的答案的，是乞乞科夫即刻抓起三个蒸饼来，卷作一筒，蘸了溶化的奶油，抛进嘴巴里，于是用饭单揩揩嘴唇和两只手。他大约这样的吃了三回之后，就请主妇吩咐去驾车。那斯泰莎·彼得洛夫娜立刻派菲替涅到院子里去了，还教她回来的时候，再带几个热的蒸饼来。

“府上的蒸饼真是好极了，太太。”乞乞科夫一面去拿刚刚送来的蒸饼，一面说。

“对啦，家里的厨娘，倒是做得很好的，”主妇回答道，“可惜的是今年的收成坏得很，面粉也就并不怎么好了。但是您为什么这样的急急呢？”她一看见乞乞科夫已经拿起了帽子，就说。“车子还完全没有套好哩。”

“阿，马上套好的，太太。我的马夫是套得很快的。”

“您到办差的时候，不会忘记我的罢，是不是？”

“不会的，不会的。”乞乞科夫说着，跨出了大门。

“您不要买荤油吗？”主妇说，跟在他后面。

“为什么不要？我当然要买的。不过得缓一缓。”

“到耶稣复活节，我就有很好的荤油了。”

“您放心，我到您这里来买；您有什么，我就买什么，也要猪油。”

“恐怕您也要绒毛罢？一到腓立波夫加(10)，我就也有鸟儿的绒毛了。”

“好的，好的。”乞乞科夫说。

“你瞧罢，先生，你的车子还没有套好哩。”他们俩走到阶沿的时候，那主妇说。

“他马上套好的。只请您告诉我，我怎么走到大路上去呢？”

“这叫我怎么办呢？”主妇说。“拐弯很多，要说给你明白，是不容易的；或者不如叫一个娃儿同去，给你引路的好罢。可是你得在马夫台上有地方给她坐。”

“那自然。”

“那么，我叫一个娃儿同去就是，她认识路的，不过你不要把她带走，你听哪，新近就有一个给几个买卖人拐去了。”

乞乞科夫对她约定，决不拐带女孩儿，科罗皤契加就又放了心，检阅她的院子了。她首先看到女管家，正从仓库里搬出一只装着蜂蜜的木桶。其次向一个农奴一瞥，他正在门道上出现，于是顺次的向她的家私什物看过去。为什么我们要把科罗皤契加讲得这么长呢？科罗皤契加，玛尼罗夫，家务或非家务，和我们又有什么相干呢？我们不管这些罢！在这世界上，是没有整齐到异乎寻常的！刚刚看见欢喜，它就变成悲哀，如果留得它很长久，接着会迸出怎样的一个思想来呢，谁也不知道！人当然可以这么想：怎样么！？在无穷之长的人格完成的梯级上，科罗皤契加岂不是的确站在最下面么？将她和她的姊妹们隔开的深渊，岂不是的确深得很么？和住在贵族府邸的不可近的围墙里，邸里是有趣的香喷喷的铸铁的扶梯，那扶梯，是眩耀着铜光，红木，华贵的地毯的她们？和看了半本书，就打呵欠，焦躁的等着渊博精明的来客，在这里给他们的精神开拓一片地，以便发挥他们的见解，卖弄他们的拾来的思想的她们？——这思想，是遵照着“趋时”的神圣的规则，一礼拜里就风靡了全市的，这思想，是并非关于因为懒散，弄得不可收拾的他们的家庭和田地，却只是关于法兰西的政治有怎样的变革，或者目前的加特力教带了怎样倾向的。算了罢，算了罢！为什么要讲这些事？然而又为什么在愉快无愁的无思无虑的瞬息中，却自然会透进一种奇特的光线到我们这里来的呢？脸上的微笑还未消尽，人却已经不是那一个，他变了别一个了，此刻显在他脸上的，已是别一种新的影子了。

“来了，我的车，”乞乞科夫一看见他的马车驶了过来，喊道，“你怎么尽是这么慢腾腾的，你这驴子！你那昨天的酒气一定还没有走尽罢。”

对于这，绥里方没有回答一句话。

“那么，再见，太太！哦，您的那小姑娘呢？”

“喂！贝拉该耶！”老婆子向一个站在阶沿近旁的大约十一二岁的娃儿，叫道。这孩子身穿一件手织的有颜色的麻布衫。赤着脚，因为刚弄得满腿泥泞，一直到上面，所以看起来好像穿着长统靴。“给这位先生引路去！”

绥里方拉她登上马夫台。上去的时候，先在踏脚上踏了一下，因此有点龌龊了，但即刻矫捷的爬上，坐在绥里方的旁边。她之后，乞乞科夫也把脚踏在踏脚上，重得车子向右边歪了过去，但也就坐好了。“呵，现在是全都舒齐了。再会罢，太太！”他用这话向地主太太告别，马也开了步。

绥里方一路上都很认真，正经，对于自己的职务也很注意，这是他在有了错处或者喝醉过酒之后，向来如此的。马匹也都干净得出奇。有一匹的颈套，平常是破破烂烂，连麻屑都从破绽里露了出来的，现在也仔细的缝过，修好了。他在路上，简直不大开口，不过有时响一声鞭子，也没有对他的马匹讲演，虽然连阿花也极愿意听一点训词。因为在这些时候，雄辩滔滔的御者是总归放宽缰绳，鞭子也不过Pro forma(11)地在马背上拂拂的。然而阴凄凄的嘴，这回却只有单调的不高兴的吆喝了，例如：“嘘！嘘！昏蛋！慢罢！”之类，另外再没有什么。阿青和议员也不满足，因为没有听到一句友爱的称赞它们的话。阿花在它那柔软肥胖的身上，吃了不少出格的受不住的鞭子。“瞧罢，这是怎么一回事？”它把耳朵略略一竖，自己想。“他竟知道应该打在那里；他不打背脊，却直接的打在怕痛的处所，不是耳朵上一鞭，就是肚子上一鞭。”

“右边？是不是？”绥里方用了这枯燥的话，转脸去问那并排坐着的小姑娘，一面拿鞭子指着亮澄澄的新绿之间的，给雨湿得乌黑的道路。

“不，还不！我就要告诉你了！”小姑娘回答道。

“那么，往那儿走呢？”当他们临近十字路的时候，绥里方问。

“这边！”小姑娘用手一指，说。

“阿唷！你！”绥里方说。“这就是右边呀！连左右也分不清。”

天气虽然好得很，道路却还是稀烂，烂泥粘着车轮，立刻好像包上了毛毡，车子不大好走了。而且泥土又很厚，很粘。因为这缘故，在午前，他们就走不到大路。如果没有这小姑娘，那是一定也很难走到的，因为许多岔路，就像把捉住的螃蟹，从网里放了出来一样，向四面八方的跑着。绥里方的容易迷路，真也怪不得他。那小姑娘又即指着远处的已经看得分明的房屋，说道：“那就是大路了。”

“那屋子是什么呢？”绥里方问。

“客店呀。”小姑娘说。

“哦，那是我们自己找得到的了。你现在可以回家去了。”

他勒住车，帮她跳下去，一面自言自语道：“你这泥腿。”

乞乞科夫给她一枚两戈贝克的铜钱。她活泼的跑回去了，高兴得很，因为她能够坐在马夫台上跑了一趟。

第四章


当临近客店的时候，乞乞科夫就叫停车，这为了两种原因，一是要给马匹休息了，二是自己也要吃些东西，添一点力气。作者应该声明，这一类人物的好胃口和食欲，可实在是令人羡慕的。对于那些住在彼得堡或是莫斯科，整天的想着早上吃什么，中午吃什么，后天早上又吃什么，待到要用午膳了，就先吞一两颗丸药，然后慢慢的吃下几个蛎黄和海蟹以及别的奇妙的海味去，终于就向凯尔巴特(1)或是高加索一跑的上流先生们，倒并不觉得有什么大意思。不，这些先生们，是引不起作者的羡慕来的。然而中流的人们呢，第一个驿站上要火腿，第二个驿站上要乳猪，到第三站是一片鲟鱼或者有蒜的香肠炙一下，于是向食桌面前坐下，无论什么时候，总仿佛不算一回事似的。大口鱼的汤，鲟鳇鱼和鱼膏在他的嘴里发响，发沸，还伴着鱼肉包子或一个鲶鱼包子，使不想吃的也看得嘴馋。——这些人物，是有一种很值得羡慕的天禀的。上流的先生们里面，情愿立刻牺牲他的农奴和他那用了本国式或外国式加以现代的改良，但已经抵押或并未抵押的田地的一半，来换取这好市民式的胃口的，目下也不只一两个了。然而对不起，即使用了钱以及改良了的或没有改良的田地，也还是弄不到一个中流先生那样的胃口来。

木造的破烂的客店，把乞乞科夫招进它那熏得乌黑的屋檐下去了，屋檐被车光的柱子所支持，很像旧式的教堂烛台模样。这客店是俄国式农民小屋之一种，不过规模大一点。窗边和屋顶下，都有新木头的雕镂的垂花，给暗昏的墙壁一比，更显得出色。外层的窗户上，画着插些花卉的酒壶。

乞乞科夫走上狭窄的木梯，跨进大门去。他在这里推开那嘎嘎发响的门，就遇见一个身穿花布衣，口说“请进来”的胖胖的老婆子。一到饭堂，他又遇到那些在村市的木造小客店里，一定看见的老相好了：生锈的茶炊，刨光的松板壁，屋角上的装着茶壶茶碗的三角架，圣像面前的描金的磁器，系着红绿带子，刚刚生过孩子的一匹猫，还有一面镜，能把两只眼睛变作四只，脸孔照成好像一种蛋饼的东西，最后，是插在圣像后面的香草和石竹的花束，但早经干透，有谁高兴去嗅一下，就只好打起喷嚏来。

“您有乳猪么？”乞乞科夫转过脸去，问那胖老婆子道。

“有有！”

“用山葵腌的，还是用酸酪腌的？”

“自然有山葵也有乳酪的。”

“拿来！”

老婆子就到柜子里去寻东西，先拿来一张碟子，其次是一块硬得像干树皮样的饭单，后来一把刀，发了黄的骨柄，刀身薄得好像削笔刀，结末是一把只有两个刺的叉子和一个简直站不住的盐瓶。

我们的主角就照着他自己的习惯，立刻和她扳谈起来了。他讯问她，她自己就是这客店的主人呢，还是另外还有东家；可以赚多少钱；她的儿子们是否和她同住；大儿子是什么职业，已经结了婚呢，还是还是单身；他娶了一个怎样的女人，有嫁资呢，还是没有；他的岳父是否满足；嫁妆太少了，那儿子可曾不高兴。总而言之，他什么琐屑都不忘记。至于他要讯问近地住着怎样的地主，那是不消说得的，他明白了这里有的是勃罗辛，坡契太耶夫，米勒诺衣，大佐且泼拉可夫，梭巴开维支。“哦！你知道梭巴开维支吗？”他问那老婆子，但接着又知道她不但认识梭巴开维支，也认识玛尼罗夫，而且玛尼罗夫要比梭巴开维支“规矩”点。“他立刻要一盘烧母鸡或是烧牛肉；如果有羊肝，那么，他就也要羊肝，什么都只吃一点点。梭巴开维支却总是只要一样，还吃得一个精光。是的，钱照旧，东西还要添好许多哩。”

当乞乞科夫在这样的谈天，一面享用着他的乳猪，盘里只剩了一片了的时候，忽然听到了跑来的马车的轮声。他从窗口一望，就看见一辆驾着三头骏马的轻快的篷车，停在客店前面了。从车子里出来了两位绅士。一个身材高大，黄头发的，别一个比较的矮小些，黑头发。黄头发穿一件暗蓝的猎褂，黑头发是蒲哈拉(2)布的普通的花条的短衫。还看见远远的来了一辆空的小篷车；拉的是颈圈和麻绳络头都已破烂，毛鬣蓬松的四匹马。黄头发即刻走上扶梯来，黑头发却还在车子里寻东西，一面指着驶来的车，和仆役说话。乞乞科夫觉得这声音仿佛有些熟识似的。他正在凝视着他的时候，那黄头发已经摸着门口，把门开开了。是一个高大的汉子，长脸盘，或者如人们所惯说的失神的脸相，一撮发红的胡须。从他那苍白的脸色判断起来，他是常常卷在烟里的，如果不是硝磺烟，那就是烟草烟。他向乞乞科夫优雅的鞠躬，这边也给了一个照样的鞠躬作为回答。不到几分钟，他们就的确都想扳谈起来，结识一下模样，因为倘没有那黑头发旅客突然闯进屋里来，他们就已经做到第一步，几乎要同时说出大雨洗了尘埃，凉爽宜于旅行之类的彼此的愉快来了。那人除下帽子，摔在桌子上，使劲的搔着头发。他是一个中等身材的汉子，通红的面颊，雪白铄亮的牙齿，漆黑的胡子的好家伙。他有血乳交融一般的新鲜的颜色；他的脸上就跃动着健康。

“唷，唷，唷，”他一看见乞乞科夫，就突然张开臂膊，喊起来了，“什么引你到这里来的？”

乞乞科夫知道，这是罗士特来夫，和这先生，曾在检事家里一同吃过饭，不到几分钟，他就已经显得非常亲密，叫起你我来了，虽然从乞乞科夫这一面，对他也并没有给与什么些微的沾惹。

“你那里去的？”罗士特来夫问，并不等候回答，又立刻接下去道：“我是从市集那里来的，好朋友；你给我道喜罢。我精光了，我连最后的一文也没有了。实实在在，一生一世，就没有弄得这么精光过。我只好雇一辆街车了。在窗口望一望罢，它还在这里！”于是他把乞乞科夫的头扭转去，几乎碰在窗框上。“看看这小马，这该死的畜生好容易把我拖到这里来了——我终于只好坐上他的车。”和这话同时，罗士特来夫就用指头指一指他的同伴。

“哦——你们还没有相识哩。我的姻兄弥秀耶夫！我们讲了你一早晨。‘留心着，’我说，‘我们也许遇见乞乞科夫的。’但是，我精光到怎样，你怕不见得明白。不管你信不信，我不但失掉了我的四匹乏马，我真的什么都化光了。我也没有了表和链子。”乞乞科夫向他一看，他可真的没有带着表和链子。而且看起来，好像他一边的胡子，也比别一边少一点，薄一点似的。

“但是，如果我的袋子里还有二十卢布呢，”罗士特来夫说下去道，“只要二十个，不必多，我一定什么都赢回来，不但什么都赢回来，还要——那么，我就是一位阔绅士，我现在还有三千在袋子里面哩。”

“那是你在那边也说了的，”这时黄头发回答他说，“但到我给你五十卢布的时候，你立刻又都输掉了。”

“上帝在上，我没有输掉。真的没有。如果我那一回不发傻，那是至今还在的。如果我在那该死的七的加倍之后，不去打那角头，我可以把全场闹翻。”

“但是你没有把它闹翻呀。”黄头发说。

“自然没有，因为我在不合适的时候，打了角头了。你以为你的大佐玩得很好吗？”

“不管好不好，总之他使你输掉了。”

“那算得什么，”罗士特来夫说，“我也会使他输得这么光。他该玩一回陀勃列忒(3)来试试，那我们就知道了，这家伙能什么。但这几天却逛得真有意思哩，朋友乞乞科夫。哦，真的，这市集可真像样。商人们自己就说，向来没有过这样的热闹。从我那领地里拿来的东西，无论什么，都得了大价钱卖掉了。唉唉，朋友，我们怎样的吃喝呵！就是现在想起来，畜生……可惜你没有在一起。你想想看，离市三维尔斯他的地方扎着一队龙骑兵，你想，全体的兵官，总该有四十个，我相信全到市里来了，于是大喝了起来……骑兵二等大尉坡采路耶夫，是一个体面人；——有胡子——这么多。他把波尔陀的葡萄酒单叫作烧酒儿。‘快给我拿一瓶葡萄烧来。’他向堂倌大嚷着。中尉库夫新涅科夫……你知道，朋友，是一个很可爱的人！简直可以说，是一个真正的酒客。我们是常在一起的。还有坡诺马略夫可给我们喝了怎样的酒呵！那是一个骗子，你要知道。他这里买不得东西。鬼知道用什么混到酒里去。这家伙是用白檀，烧焦的软木，按骨木心在著色的；但如果要他从最里面的，叫作‘至圣无上’的屋子里，悄悄的取出一瓶来，那可实在，朋友，立刻要相信是在七重天上了。还有香槟，我对你说！……比起这来，那知事家的简直就是水酒。告诉你罢，还不是单单的香槟哩，是一种极品香槟，双蒸的香槟呀。我还喝了一瓶法国酒，‘蓬蓬’牌，哪，那香气——哼，就像蔷薇苞，另外呢，都有，你想什么就像什么……阿唷，我们大喝了呵！……我们之后还来了一个公爵。他要香槟。对不起，全市里一瓶也不剩了；兵官们把所有的酒都喝光了。你可以相信我，中饭的时候，我一个就灌了十七瓶！”

“喂，喂！十七瓶，你可是还没有到的。”黄头发点破道。

“我是一个很正直的人，我确是喝了的。”

“你怎么想，就怎么说罢。我对你说，你一下子是挡不住十瓶的。”

“打一个赌罢！”

“赌什么呢？”

“好，我们来赌你那市上买来的猎枪！”

“我不来。”

“唉，什么，来罢，试试看！”

“但是我一点也不想试。”

“你以为没有枪，就和没有帽子一样坏。听呀，朋友乞乞科夫，我可是真可惜你没有在那里。我知道，你一定会和库夫新涅科夫中尉分拆不开的。你们立刻会成为知己的。他不像检事和那些我们市里的乡下阔佬一样，为了每一文钱发抖。他都来：盖勒毕克(4)呀，彭吉式加(5)呀，你爱什么就玩什么。唉唉，乞乞科夫，但和你玩什么，做什么呢。真的，你是一个大滑头，你这老狐狸！和我亲一个嘴！我爱得你要死了。弥秀耶夫你瞧，运命拉拢了我们的；他来找我呢还是我在找他？一个很好的日子里，他来了，上帝才知道他从那里来的！但是我恰恰也正住在这地方……那边车子有多少呀，好朋友！多得很哩，你要知道。en gros(6)呀！我也去抽了一回签，赢了两小盒香油，一只磁杯，一张六弦琴。我再来看看我的运气的时候，又都输出去了，舞弊呵，还添上六个卢布。如果你知道库夫新涅科夫是怎样的一个花花公子，那就好。所有跳舞场，我总和他一同去；有一个，那真是好打扮，璎珞，花边，哼，什么都全有。我总在自己想：她妈的！但那库夫新涅科夫呢——就是一匹野兽，可对？——却坐近她去，用法国话去打招呼了。你可以相信我，他是连一个乡下女人也不肯放过的。他叫作‘摘野莓’。鱼也真好，尤其是鲟鱼。我带了一条来——还好，还在有钱的时候，我就想到要买它一条了。那么，你现在要到那里去呀？”

“哦，我要去找一个人。”乞乞科夫说。

“找怎样的人？唉唉，算了罢！我们还是一同到我的家里去罢！”

“不，不，这不行。我有事情呢。”

“怎么，有事情！胡说白道！喂，你，阿波兑勒杜克·伊凡诺维支(7)！”

“不行，真的，我有事情，而且很有点要紧的！”

“我来打一个赌，你撒谎！你说罢，到底找谁去？”

“唔，可以的。找梭巴开维支去。”

罗士特来夫立刻迸出一种洪大而且响亮的笑来，这种笑，是只有活泼而健康的人才有的，这时他大张了嘴巴，脸上的筋肉都在抖动，就露出一口完整的，糖一般又白又亮的牙齿来，连隔着两道门，在第三间屋子里的邻人，也会从梦中惊起，睁大了眼睛，喊起来道：“怎的这么高兴呀！”

“这有什么好笑呢？”乞乞科夫说，对于这在笑的人，他有一点懊恼了。然而罗士特来夫放大了喉咙，仍然笑，一面嚷道：“不，请不要见气；我要笑炸了！”

“这毫没有什么可笑：我和他约过的。”乞乞科夫说。

“但到他那里去，你的生活不会有意思；他完全是一个吝啬鬼，刽子手！我明白你的脾气，如果你想在那里玩彭吉式加，喝好蓬蓬酒或者别的什么，那是一个天大的错。听哪，好朋友！抛掉这妈的梭巴开维支罢！到我那里去！我请你吃鲟鱼，坡诺马略夫这畜生，是什么时候都应酬得乱七八糟的，却担保道：‘这是我特别办给你的！你就是跑遍全市集，也找不到这样的货色。’不过他是一个奸刁的流氓！我就当面对他说：‘您和我们的包做烧酒人，都是天下第一等大骗子。’我这么说了。这畜生就笑起来，摸摸自己的胡子。库夫新涅科夫和我，是每天到他店里去吃早饭的。哦，好朋友，我几乎忘记告诉你了：我知道你不会放开我，不过得声明在先，你就是出一万卢布也弄它不到手！”——“喂，坡尔菲里！”他走向窗口，去叫他的仆人。那人却一只手拿一把刀，一只手拿着面包皮和一片鲟鱼，那是趁了到车子里去取东西的机会捞来的。“喂，坡尔菲里！”罗士特来夫喊道，“拿那小狗来！一条很好的狗！哼！”他转脸向了乞乞科夫，接下去道。“自然是偷来的！那主人不肯卖。我要用那匹枣骝马和他换，你知道，就是我从式服斯替略夫换来的那一匹呀。”但乞乞科夫却从他有生以来，一向就没有见过式服斯替略夫和枣骝马。

“老爷们不要用点什么吗？”这时那老婆子走近他们来，说。

“不！不要！我告诉你，朋友！我们逛了呀！不过你可以给我们一杯烧酒！你有什么酒？”

“有亚尼斯。”老婆子回答道。

“就是，也行，一杯亚尼斯。”罗士特来夫大声说。

“那就也给我一杯！”那黄头发道。

“戏园里一个歌女上台了，唱起来简直像夜莺一样，这样的一只金丝雀！库夫新涅科夫是坐在我旁边的，对我说：‘朋友，你知道！这野莓我想摘一下了！’由我看来，就是玩乐的棚子的数目，也在五十以上。绥那尔提(8)风磨似的打着旋子，有四个钟头。”于是他从向他低低的弯着腰的老婆子的手里，接过杯子来。“拿这儿来！”一看见坡尔菲里捧着小狗，走进屋子里，他忽然大叫起来。坡尔菲里的衣服，也像他的主人一样，穿一件蒲哈拉布的短衫，不过更加脏一点。

“拿这儿来，放在这儿，地板上面！”

坡尔菲里把狗儿放在地板上，它就张开了四条腿，嗅起地板来了。

“就是这条狗！”罗士特来夫说着，一面捏住它的领子，用一只手高高的举起。那狗就迸出一种真的叫苦的声音。

“我吩咐过你的，你又没有做。”罗士特来夫对坡尔菲里说，一面留心的看着那狗的肚子。“篦篦它，你简直全不记得了。”

“没有，我篦了的。”

“那么，这些跳蚤从那儿来的呀？”

“那我不知道。也许是，它从马车上弄来的罢！”

“胡说！昏蛋！给它篦篦，你梦里也想不到；我看是就是你这驴子把自己的过给了它的。瞧呀，乞乞科夫，瞧呀，怎样的耳朵！你来呀，碰一碰看！”

“何必呢！我看见的！这种子很好。”乞乞科夫说。

“不不，碰一碰看；摸一下耳朵！”

乞乞科夫要向罗士特来夫表示好意，便摸了一下那狗的耳朵。“是的，会成功一匹好狗的。”他加添着说。

“再摸摸它那冰冷的鼻头！拿手来呀！”因为要不使他扫兴，乞乞科夫就又碰一碰那鼻子，于是说道：“不是平常的鼻子！”

“这是真正的猛狗呵！”罗士特来夫还要继续的说。“我得招认，我想找一匹猛狗，是已经很久的了。喂，坡尔菲里，拿它去。”

坡尔菲里捧着那狗的肚子，搬回马车去了。

“听哪，乞乞科夫，你现在应该无条件的同我一道去。离这里不过五维尔斯他。我们一下子就到。这之后，你可以再找梭巴开维支去的。”

“唔！”乞乞科夫想。“其实我竟不妨也去找罗士特来夫一趟。归根结蒂，他也不会比别人坏。同大家一样，是一个人！况且他又输了钱。这人什么都大意。我也许能够无须破费，从他那里抢点什么来的。”——“也好罢，可以的，不过有一层，你不能留住我；我的时间是贵的。”

“你瞧，心肝，你这么听话；乖乖。走过来，给你亲一个嘴罢！”于是罗士特来夫和乞乞科夫拥抱着，亲爱的接了吻。“很好，现在我们三个儿走罢！”

“不成，我是得请你原谅的，”黄头发说，“我该回家去了。”

“吓，胡涂，朋友！我不放你走。”

“不成，真的，我的太太也要不高兴的；况且你现在可以坐他的马车去了。”

“不行，不行，不行！你万不要想。”

那黄头发是这样的人们中的一个，起初，看他的性格是刚强的，别人刚刚张开嘴，他的话里已经带着争辩，如果和他的意见相反，他也决不赞成。他不肯称愚蠢为聪明，尤其是别人吹起笛子来，他决不跳舞。但到结末，却显出他的性质里有着一点柔弱，驯良，到底是对于他首先所反对的变了赞成，称愚蠢为聪明，而且跟着别人的笛子，做起非常出色的跳舞来了。他们以激昂始，以丢脸终。

“吓，胡涂。”对于那黄头发的抗议，罗士特来夫回答着，把帽子捺在他的头上，于是——黄头发就跟着他们出去了。

“慈善的老爷，酒钱还没有付呢。”老婆子从他们后面叫喊道。

“不错，不错，妈妈！对不起，好兄弟，你替我付一付！我的袋子里一文也没有。”

“要多少？”那亲戚问。

“有限得很，先生。不过八十戈贝克。”

“胡说！给她半卢布，已经太多了。”

“太少一点，慈善的老爷。”老婆子说。但也谢着收了钱，没命的跑去开门了。她并不折本，因为她把烧酒涨价了四倍。

旅客们走上马车，就了坐。乞乞科夫的车，和坐着罗士特来夫和他亲戚的篷车并排着走，三个人在一路上都可以彼此自由的谈天。罗士特来夫的乡下牲口拉着的小篷车，缓缓的跟着，总是慢一点，那里面坐着坡尔菲里和小狗。

我们的旅客们的热心的谈天，在读者一定是没有什么大趣味的，我们还不如趁这时候，讲几句罗士特来夫本人罢，他在我们的诗篇里，所演的恐怕也并不是很小的脚色。

罗士特来夫的相貌，读者一定已经很有些认识了。我们里面的无论谁，遇到这种典型的人物，是决不只一次的。大家称他们为快男儿；当还是儿童和在学校的时候，就被看作好脚色，但也因此得到往往很痛的鞭笞。他们的脸上，总表现着坦白，直爽，和确实的英勇。他们一看见人，别人还不及四顾，就马上成了朋友。他们还立誓要做永久的朋友，而且好像也要守住他们的誓约似的；然而这新朋友大抵就在结交的欢宴的这一晚上，发生争论，又彼此打起来了。他们爱说话，会化钱，有胆量，不改口。罗士特来夫已经三十五岁了，却还像十八二十岁一样：爱逛荡，找玩乐。结婚也没有改变他一点，况且他的太太不久就赴了安乐的地府，只留给他两个孩子，那在他是毫无用处的。他把照管孩子们的事，都托付了一个真的非常之好的保姆。在自己的家里，他停不了一整天。如果什么地方有市集，什么地方有集会，有跳舞或是祝典，即使距离有十五维尔斯他之远，他的精灵的鼻子也嗅得出；一刹时他就在那里了，在赌桌上吵起来，大捣其乱，因为他也如这一流人一样，是一个狂热的赌客。我们在第一章上已经知道，他是玩得并不十分干净的，他会耍一套做记号和弄花样，所以到后来，这玩耍就常常变成别种的玩耍：他不是挨一顿痛打，遭几脚狠踢，就是被人拔掉他那出色的茂密的络腮胡子，至于只剩了也很有限的半部胡子回家。然而他那健康丰满的面颊，是用极好的质料造成的，又贯注着很强的繁殖力，胡子立刻又生出来了，而且比先前的更出色。而且最奇特的是，这大概是只有在俄国才会出现的——不久之后，他就又和痛打了他的朋友混在一起，大家扳谈，仿佛全没有过什么事，他这一面，也好像毫未受过侮辱似的了。

在若干关系上，罗士特来夫是一位“故事的”人物。没有那一个集会，只要他有份，会不闹出一点“故事”来的。那“故事”常常是：被几个宪兵捏着臂膊，拉出客厅，或者给他自己的朋友硬推到门外去。如果不是这些，那么，就总要闹一点别人决不会闹出来的什么事，或者在食堂里喝得烂醉，只是笑个不住，或者受了亲口所说的谎话的拖累，终于自己吃亏。他无缘无故的说谎。他会突然想到，讲了起来，说自己有过一匹马，是蓝条纹毛的，或淡红条纹毛的，或者是诸如此类的胡说，一直弄到在场的人们全都走开，并且说道：“哪，兄弟，我看你是诞妄起来了！”有一些人，是有一种毫无缘故，对于身边的人，说些坏话的热情的。例如有人，身居高位，一表非凡，胸前挂着星章，亲爱的握了别一个的手，谈着令人沉思默想的极深刻的问题，但突然又当大家的眼前，说起对手的坏话来了，他就像一个平庸的十四等官，不再是胸前挂着星章，谈着令人沉思默想的极深刻的问题的人物，人们就只好痴立，出惊，至多是耸一耸肩。罗士特来夫就也有这一种奇特的嗜好的。一有谁接近他，他就弄得他非常之窘：他散布一切出乎情理之外的，几乎不能更加昏妄的谣言，拆散婚姻，破坏交易，然而并不以为对人做了坏事；倒相反，待到再和他见面，却很亲热的走过来，说道：“你真是一个平凡得很的家伙！你为什么一向不来看看我呢？”在许多事情上，罗士特来夫确是一个多方面的人物，这就是说，他无所不能。他肯马上领你们到天涯海角去，他肯一同去冒险，他肯和你们换东西。枪，狗，马，都是他的交换目的物，然而想沾便宜的隐情，却是丝毫没有的；这不过是含在他那性格里面的一种活泼性和豪爽性的关系。他在市集上，幸而碰着一个傻瓜，赌赢了，那就把先前在店铺里看中了的东西，统统买拢来：马的颈圈，发香蜡烛，保姆的头巾，一匹母马，葡萄干，一只银盆，荷兰麻布，上等面粉，淡巴菇，手枪，青鱼，画，磨石，壶，长统靴，磁器，到用完了钱为止。然而他把这些好东西带回家去的事情，是非常少有的：大抵就在这一日里，和别一个运道更好的赌客玩牌，弄得一干二净，有时还要添上自己的烟斗，烟袋，烟嘴，或者简直又是四驾马全班和一切附属品：篷车和马夫，弄得主人只好自己穿了一件短衣或者蒲哈拉布衫，跑去找寻可以许他搭车的朋友。这样的是罗士特来夫！人也许以为这是过去的典型，并且说，现在可全没有罗士特来夫们了。阿，不然！说这话的人，是不对的。罗士特来夫在这世界上，是不至于消灭得这么快的。我们之间，到处都是，而且大约不过是偶然穿了一件别样的衣服；然而人们是粗心，皮相的；一个人只要换上别样的衣服，他们也就当作完全另一个人了。

这之间，三辆马车已经到了罗士特来夫家的阶沿的前面。招待他们的设备，家里却一点也没有。食堂中央，有两个做工的站在踏台上，刷着墙壁，一面唱着永不会完的单调的歌儿，石灰洒满了一地板。罗士特来夫立刻跑向他们去，他们就得和他们的踏台一同连忙滚出，于是跑向间壁的屋子，到那里续发其次的命令去了。客人们听到，他在叫厨子备午餐；已经又觉得有点肚饿的乞乞科夫，就知道总得快到五点钟，这才可以入座。罗士特来夫又即回来了，要带客人们到他那领地上去散步，还给他们看看可看的东西。他们为了目睹这一切，大约化了两个多钟头。直到无所不看，无可再看的时候，罗士特来夫这才安静。他们最先看马房，有两匹母马，一匹是带斑的灰色的，一匹是枣红色的，还有一匹栗壳色的雄马。雄马也并不见得出色，但罗士特来夫却宣誓而且力说，这是他化了一万卢布买来的。

“一万是一定不到的，”那亲戚注意到，“这还值不到一千。”

“上帝在上！这值一万！”罗士特来夫说。

“你要起誓，随便起多少就是。”那亲戚回答着。

“那么，好罢，你肯打一个赌？”罗士特来夫说。

然而亲戚不要赌。

于是罗士特来夫把空的马房示给客人们，先前是有几匹好马在这里面的。也还有一只雄山羊，向来的迷信，以为这是马房里万不可少的东西，它和它的伙伴会立刻很要好，在肚子下往来散步，像在家里一样。之后，罗士特来夫又带了两位绅士走，要给他们看一匹锁着的小狼。“这是狼儿！”他说，“我是在用生肉喂它的！”之后又去看一个池，这池里，据罗士特来夫说，有着这么大的鱼，倘要拉它上来，至少也得用两条大汉。然而这时候，他的亲戚又怀疑了。“听哪，乞乞科夫，”罗士特来夫说，“我给你看几条出色的狗，那筋肉之强壮，是万想不到的！还有那鼻子！尖得像针！”他说着，领他们去到一间干净的小屋子，在四面围着的大院子的中央。他们一走进去，就看见一大群收罗着的狗，长毛的和浅毛的，所有毛色，所有种类，深灰色的，黑色的，黑斑的和灰斑的，浅色点的，虎斑的，灰色点的，黑耳朵的，白耳朵的，此外还不少……还有听起来简直像是无上命令似的各种狗名字，例如咬去，醒来，骂呀，发火，不要脸，上帝在此，暴徒，刺儿，箭儿，燕子，宝贝，女监督等。罗士特来夫在它们里，完全好像在他自己的家族之间的父亲：所有的狗，都高高兴兴的翘起了猎人切口之所谓“鞭”的尾巴，活泼的向客人们冲来，招呼了。至少有十条向罗士特来夫跳起来，把爪子搭在他的肩膀上。“骂呀”向乞乞科夫也表示了同样的亲爱，用后脚站起，给了一个诚恳的接吻，至于使他连忙吐一口唾沫。于是罗士特来夫用以自傲的狗的好筋肉，大家都已目睹了——诚然，狗也真的好。还去看克理米亚的母狗，已经瞎了眼，据罗士特来夫说，是就要倒毙的。两年以前，却还是一条很好的母狗。大家也来察看这母狗，看起来，它也确乎瞎了眼。从这里又走开去，因为要去看水磨，但使上面的磨石不动摇，并且转得很快的轴子，或者用俄国乡下人的怪话，为了它上上下下的跳着，就叫作“蚤子”的那轴子，却没有了。“现在是就要到铁厂了。”罗士特来夫说。走了几步，大家也的确看见了铁厂，于是又察看了一下。

“在这田坂上，”罗士特来夫指着，说，“兔子就有这么多，连地面都看不见了。新近我就亲自用手拉住了一匹的后脚。”

“哪，你要知道，用手是捉不住兔子的。”那亲戚插嘴说。

“我可是捉住了一匹！真的！”罗士特来夫回答道。“哦，现在我要带你们看我的领地的边界去了。”他向乞乞科夫转过脸来，接着说。

罗士特来夫领客人们经过田坂，到处是生苔的小土冈。客人们都得从休耕的和耕过的田里取路。乞乞科夫觉得有些疲乏了。许多地方，他的脚竟陷在烂地里：泥土应脚陷得很深。开初，他们是在留心回避着走的，但到知道了这也不中用，就不管什么地方烂泥积得最厚，单是信步的跑上去了。走过许多路之后，终于也看见了边界，是用一个木桩和一条小沟分划开来的。

“这是边界，”罗士特来夫说，“统统，所有在这边的——都是我的产业，连那个树林，那你们望去在那边蓝森森的，还有树林后面的地方，都是我的。”

“什么时候变了你的树林的？”那亲戚问。“你新近买的吗？先前可还不是你的呢。”

“唔，就是新近买进来的。”罗士特来夫说。

“怎么能买的这样快呢？”

“就是前天买好的，化了很多的钱，妈的！”

“那时你不在市集上吗？”

“唉唉，你这聪明的梭夫伦，人就不能一面逛市集，一面买田地吗？不错，我是在市集上，管家却当我不在的时候，把林子买下来了。”

“那总该是管家买的了。”那亲戚说，还是不相信，摇摇头。

客人们仍旧走着先前的不像样的路，回了家。罗士特来夫又引他们到自己的书斋里，但一间办事房里总归可以看到的东西，在这里却什么也不能发见的，这就是没有书，也没有纸，壁上只挂着一把长刀和两枝枪，一枝三百卢布，别一枝是八百卢布。那亲戚向屋子里看了一遍，尽是摇着头。罗士特来夫又给他的朋友们看了几柄土耳其的剑，其中的一柄上见有铭文道，“匠人萨惠黎·西比略科夫”(9)，大概只是误刻上去的。这之后，客人们又有摇琴赏鉴了，罗士特来夫立刻奏起一个曲子来。摇琴的声音并不坏，不过里面好像发生了一点什么，因为罗士特来夫奏着的玛兹尔加，忽然变成英雄马尔巴罗(10)上阵了的歌，而这又用那很旧的华勒支曲来结了末。罗士特来夫早已不摇了，但这机器有一个极勇敢的管子，简直不肯沉默，独自还响了很久的时光。之后是大家要看烟斗了，罗士特来夫收集得很不少：木烟斗，磁烟斗，海泡石烟斗，烟熏了的和没有烟熏的，麂皮包着的和没有包着的，等等；又看见一枝琥珀嘴的长烟管，是罗士特来夫新近赢来的，还有一个刺绣的烟袋，是在什么驿站上，忘魂失魄的爱上了他的一位伯爵夫人的赠品，而且她的手儿，是“尽纤细之极致”的，这句话，大约算是把完美之至的意思，竭力表示了出来的了。大家吃过几片鲟鱼之后，将近五点钟，这才就了食桌。在罗士特来夫的生活上，中餐是没有排在大节目里面的，因为对于食品的烹调，好像并不十分看重；有的太熟，有的还生。厨子也似乎大抵只照着一种什么灵感，就用手头的一切好物事，做出肴馔来：近旁刚有胡椒瓶，他就把胡椒末撒在菜盘里——桌上有一株卷心菜，他就也加上卷心菜，还随手放进牛奶，火腿，豌豆去。——一言以蔽之：他混起来，只要这菜热，也就已经有一种味道了！但罗士特来夫对于酒类，却看得很要紧：汤还没有上桌，他就先敬了客人一大杯葡萄酒，第二杯是上等白葡萄酒。因为府署和县署所在的市里，是没有平常的白葡萄酒的。此后罗士特来夫又叫取一瓶玛兑拉酒来，“就是大元帅，也没有喝过这么好的。”的确，这玛兑拉会烧人的喉咙，因为商人们是知道他们的买主——地主——的嗜好，喜欢强有力的玛兑拉的，他就尽量的羼进蔗酒去，有时也看准了俄国人的胃脏，什么都受得下，于是放一点王水(11)在里面。临了，罗士特来夫又叫取一瓶很特别的酒来，据他说，是一种香槟和蒲尔戈浓的综合。他极热心的斟满了左右两边的杯子，给他的亲戚和乞乞科夫；但乞乞科夫觉到，他给自己却斟得很少。这使乞乞科夫有了一点戒心；当罗士特来夫正对着亲戚谈天或是斟酒之际，便乘机把自己的一杯倒在菜盘里了。接着又立刻拿出一瓶乌莓烧酒来，据罗士特来夫说，是全像奶油味道的，但奇怪的是不过发着很强的浊酒气。后来又喝了一种香醪，有一个名目，然而很不容易记，连主人自己第二回说起来也完全是另一个了。中餐早已完毕，酒也都试过了，但客人们却还不离开桌面，乞乞科夫总不愿意当着那个亲戚的面，向罗士特来夫说出他藏在心里的事情来：那亲戚究竟是外人，这事情却只能密谈的。但那亲戚也未必是一个于他有害的人，因为他已经大醉，埋在椅子里，早就抬不起头的了。后来他自己也觉得情形有些不妙，就请罗士特来夫放他回家去，而且说的很低，很倦的声音，好像——用民族的俄国的表现说起来——用钳在马头上拔马嚼子。

“不行，不行，不行，我不放你走！”罗士特来夫说。

“不要难我了，好朋友！真的，我要走！”那亲戚恳求道。“你不该这么虐待我的！”

“胡说！发昏！来，我们玩一下彭吉式加。”

“不行，好人，还是你自己玩罢！我实在不能玩了，我的太太要很不高兴我的；我也还得对她讲讲市集的情形去。真的，朋友！不给她一点小高兴，这是我的大罪过呀。求求你，不要留我了罢！”

“管她老婆什么妈……！好像顶要紧的是你们两口子在一起！”

“不不，真的，朋友！她是很好的，我的太太——能干，诚实，一个模范的贤妻！她待我好。你可以相信我，我是常常感激得至于下泪的。不不，不要想留住我了罢；我是一个正人君子——我得走了。我告诉你！老老实实！”

“放他走罢，我们要他做什么呢！”乞乞科夫悄悄的对罗士特来夫说。

“你说的对！”罗士特来夫道，“我最讨厌这样的孱头！”于是他大声的说下去道：“好罢，那就滚你的。去！尽找你的老婆去，你这吹牛皮的！”

“不是的，朋友！你不能骂我是吹牛皮的！”那亲戚回答说。“我仗她才有生活呢。真的！她是很可爱，很好，很温柔，娇小……我常常要流出眼泪来。她会问我，我在市集上看见了些什么——我得统统告诉她——她很可爱……”

“那么，去和她胡说白道去就是！”

“不，听哪，好朋友！你不能这样说她的，这也就是侮辱我呀，她是很好，很可爱的。”

“是了，快滚罢！找她去！”

“是的，的确，我要走了；原谅我不能奉陪。我是极高兴在这里的，但是我实在做不到。”那亲戚总在絮叨着一切陪罪的话，却没有留心到他已经坐上马车，拉出大门，在露天底下，田野上面了。由此知道，他的太太怕也未必会听到多少市集的情形罢。

“这么一个废物！”罗士特来夫走向窗口，目送着跑远去的马车，说。“这么跑！那旁边的马倒不坏，我早就看上了的。不过这家伙总不肯。只是一个孱头！”

大家走到隔壁的屋里去。坡尔菲里拿进烛火来，乞乞科夫忽然见有一副纸牌在主人的手里了，却不知道他是从那里取来的。

“来一下小玩艺罢，朋友！”罗士特来夫说，一面把纸牌一挤，又一松，那十字封条就断掉，落在地上了。“消遣消遣呀，你知道。我想玩一下三百卢布的彭吉式加！”

然而乞乞科夫只装作全没有听到那些话的样子，却自己突然想到了什么似的，说道：“哦，几乎忘记了，我要和你商量一点事！”

“什么事呀？”

“但你得豫先约定可以允许我！”

“那是什么事呢？”

“不，你得先和我约定的！你听真！”

“那么，好罢。可以的！”

“一言为定！”

“一言为定！”

“那么：你一定有一大批死掉的农奴，户口册上却还没有注销的罢！”

“自然！这又怎么样呢？”

“都让给我。把他们归到我的名下去！”

“你拿这有什么用呢？”

“我有用。”

“不，你说，什么用？”

“就是有用……这是我这边的事情了——一句话，我有用处。”

“里面一定还有缘故的。你一定在计画什么事。说出来罢！什么事？”

“唉唉，什么计画呵！这样的无聊东西。我能拿它计画什么呢？”

“那么，你要他们做什么呢？”

“我的上帝，你真是爱管闲事！无论什么垃圾，你也要用手去摸一下，而且简直还会嗅一下！”

“是的，但是你为什么不肯说呢？”

“就是我说了，你有什么用呢？这是很简单的，不过我想这么的干一下！”

“就是了，如果你不说，我就也不给！”

“听罢，这是你丢面子的。你说过一言为定的了，现在却想不算了！”

“很好，随你说罢。在你没有告诉我之前，我不答应！”

“我怎么告诉他才是呢？”乞乞科夫想；他略一盘算，才来说明他的要找死魂灵，为的是想在交际社会里，增加自己的名望，他没有大财产，所以原有的魂灵也不多。

“你胡说，”罗士特来夫说，打断了他的话，“你胡说，兄弟！”

乞乞科夫自己也觉到，他的谎实在撒的不聪明，这虚构的口实也的确没有力量。“那么，好，我老实告诉你罢，”他正经的说道，“我请你只放在自己的心里，不要传开去。我准备结婚了，但可恨的是我那新妇的父母是极难说话的人，总想出人头地。一对该死的东西！和这样的有了关系，我倒在懊悔了。他们一定要新郎至少也有三百个魂灵，但我可一共几乎还缺一百五十个，那么……”

“不的，兄弟，你胡说！”罗士特来夫又喊起来。

“不，真的，这回是连这样的一点谎也没有的。”乞乞科夫说着，用拇指头在小指尖上划出一块极小的地方来。

“如果不是胡说，拿我的脑袋去！”

“听哪，你侮辱我！我是何等样人呀？我为什么总要说谎呢？”

“可是我明白你了：你是一个大骗子——要知道我是看朋友交情上，这才说说的。如果我是你的上司，第一着就是在树上缢死你！”

听了这话，乞乞科夫觉得受侮了。凡有粗卤的，有伤中庸的界限的表现，是使他不舒服的。他不喜欢和不相干的别人亲昵，但如果那是上等人物，就又作别论。因此他现在觉得心里不高兴。

“上帝在上，我要缢死你！”罗士特来夫重复说，“我很坦白的说出来，而且说这也并不是为了侮辱你，倒是因为我自己相信，我是你的朋友。”

“一切事情都有一个界限，”乞乞科夫俨然的说，“倘若你爱用这样的语调，不如进兵营去。”——于是他又接下去道：“你不肯送，那么，卖给我也可以的。”

“卖！我明白你了。你是一个流氓。你不肯多出钱的。”

“哪，你也该知足了！想一想罢，你以为那是宝石似的东西吗？”

“你说的对，我明白你了。”

“不，听罢，朋友，多么小气呀。你其实是应该送给我的。”

“那就是了，我一个钱也不要，给你看看我并不是这么一个吝啬鬼。你买一匹种马去，农奴就算作添头。”

“请你想想，我要种马做什么用呢？”乞乞科夫说，对于这提议，非常诧异了。

“你做什么用？买这捣乱家伙，我化了一万卢布，你只要出四千。”

“但是我拿它去做什么呀！我并没有牧场。”

“是的，再听我说，你还没有懂呢。现在我只要三千。其余的一千你可以后来再付的。”

“是的，但是，我简直完全用不着！实实在在！”

“那就是了，那么，买我的那匹枣红的母马去罢！”

“我也用不着母马。”

“我给你母马，还添上你已经见过的那匹灰色小马，只要二千卢布。”

“我用不着马！”乞乞科夫说。

“你可以再去卖掉的。无论在那一个市集上，你都能赚三倍。”

“如果你相信可以赚这么多的钱，还是自己卖去罢。”

“这能赚钱，我是知道的，不过我愿意你也赚一点。”

乞乞科夫陈谢了他的友情，并且坚决的回绝了枣红的母马和灰色的小马。

“那么，在我这里买几匹狗去罢！有一对可以给你的小夫妻在这里；会使你乐到脊梁都抽搐起来的。刺毫毛，硬胡子；那成堆的毫毛，就像刺猬的刺一样，而且那肋骨呵——简直是铁箍。还有那又小又胖的爪子——几乎不沾地！……”

“唉唉！我用不着狗。我不是猎户。”

“但我很希望你也养几条狗。不过，你知道，如果你不要狗，那就买我的摇琴去。我告诉你，那是好东西。我自己呢，我是一个正人君子，不打谎，那时化了一千。给你却只要九百。”

“我要摇琴做什么用呀？我又不是德国人，要拿了这东西挨家的讨钱去！”

“但这并不是德国人所有的那样筒琴哩。这是一个风琴，你仔细的看去。真正玛霍戈尼树做的！来，我再给你看一下罢！”罗士特来夫就捏住乞乞科夫的手，拉到邻室去，他抵抗，两脚钉住了地板，想不动，他力辩，自己很知道那摇琴，然而都没有用，他总得再听一回马尔巴罗怎样的去上阵。

“如果你不愿意给我钱，那么，我们就这么办罢，你知道，我给你摇琴，再加上所有的死魂灵，你就留下你的篷车，还只要再付三百卢布。”

“又来了？我怎么回去呢？”

“我另外给你一辆车。在库房里，我就给你看！你只要去漆一下。那就是一辆很体面的马车了！”

“这人给冒失鬼附了体吗？”乞乞科夫想，并且下了英勇的决心，凡有罗士特来夫的马车，摇琴，以及一切平常和异常的狗，即使那是未尝前闻的，铁箍似的肋骨和又小又肥的爪子，都给他一个不要。

“但是你全都到手了呀：马车，摇琴，死魂灵。”

“但是我不要。”乞乞科夫又说了一遍。

“为什么你简直不要？”

“很简单，因为我不要，这就尽够了！”

“唉唉，你这家伙！和你打交道，是不能像和一个好朋友或是伴当的。真是一个……！人立刻明白，你是有两个舌头的人。”

“是的，我是驴子，对不对？毫无用处的东西，我为什么非买不可呢？”

“不不，不要提了！现在我明白你了。这样的一个无赖汉，的的确确。好罢，你听着，我们来玩一下彭吉式加。我押上所有的死魂灵，再加摇琴。”

“不，不，我的好人，用赌博来决输赢，是靠不住的。”乞乞科夫向对手拿着的纸牌看了一眼，说。他觉得对手很难相信。连纸牌也可疑。

“为什么靠不住？”罗士特来夫说。“这是没有什么靠不住的；如果你运气好，妈的，就什么都到手。瞧罢，你的运气多么好。”他说着，摊开几张纸牌来，要引起乞乞科夫打牌的兴趣。“哪，这样的好运气，这样的好运气！总是这样上风。你瞧，这是该死的十，我会因此输得精光的。我知道会使我输得精光。但是我闭起眼睛，心里想，妈的！请便罢，这奸细！”

罗士特来夫正在讲说的时候，坡尔菲里又拿进一瓶酒来了。但乞乞科夫都坚决的拒绝，不喝酒也不玩牌。

“你为什么不要玩？”罗士特来夫道。

“因为我不高兴。老实说，我根本就不是一个赌友。”

“为什么你不是一个赌友的呢？”

“就因为我不是一个赌友呀！”乞乞科夫说，并且耸一耸肩。

“无聊家伙，你这！”

“上帝这样的造了我了，我也没法。”

“简直是一条懒虫。先前我至少还当你是一个有些体面的人。可是你全不明白打交道。对你不能说知心话，你是连一点点的面子也不要的。全像梭巴开维支！废料一枚！”

“你说出来，为什么骂我的？不玩牌，就是我的错处吗？如果你是这么一个斤斤计较的家伙，那么，把魂灵卖给我就是了！”

“你拿恶鬼去！而且还是没有头毛的。我本要白送给你的，现在你可是拿不到手了，就是你献出一个王国来，我也不给。这样的一个扒手！这样的一个龌龊的坏货！我从此不和你来往了。坡尔菲里，告诉管马房的去，不要给他的马匹吃燕麦了。给吃干草就尽够。”

这样的结局，乞乞科夫是没有豫先想到的。

“我还是不看见你的好！”罗士特来夫说。

这吵架并没有阻碍了主人和他的客人一同吃晚饭，虽然这回在桌上不再摆出各种佳名的酒来。不过孤另另的站着一小瓶，是契沛尔酒之一种，但其实是人们大抵叫作酸的浊酒的。晚饭之后，罗士特来夫领乞乞科夫到一间旁边的屋子里，那里面铺着一张给他睡觉的床，并且说道：“你的床在这里。我不高兴对你说什么晚安。”

说完这话，他出去了，只剩下乞乞科夫一个人，心情恶劣之至。他在懊恨自己，自责他的同来这里，费了他许多要紧的时光；最难宽恕的是竟对他说出了自己的事情；真是粗心浮气，活像一个傻子；因为这一类事情，是完全不能对罗士特来夫说的。罗士特来夫是一个坏货；他会添造些谣言，不知道要散布怎样的谎话，到底还弄出一个无聊的话柄来呢……晦气，真真大晦气！“我真是一头驴子！”他对自己说。这一夜他睡得很坏。有一种很小，却很勇敢的虫，不住的来咬他，痛的挡不住，使他用五个指头搔着痛处，一面唠叨道：“恶鬼抓了你去罢，连罗士特来夫！”当他醒来的时候，还早得很。他的开首第一着，是披上睡衣，穿好长靴之后，就到院子边沿的马房去，吩咐绥里方立刻套车子。归途中遇见了罗士特来夫，他也一样的穿着睡衣，嘴里咬着烟斗，在院子里从对面走过来。

罗士特来夫很亲昵的招呼他，还问他夜里睡得怎么样。

“总是这样！”乞乞科夫冷淡的答道。

“我也是的，朋友……”罗士特来夫说。“你可知道，我给该死的鬼东西闹了一整夜，我简直说不清；昨夜嘴里还有一种味儿，好像是一整队的骑兵在那里过夜。你知道，我梦见挨了鞭子。真的！你猜是谁打的呢？我来打一个赌，你一定猜不着：是骑兵二等大尉坡采路耶夫和库夫新涅科夫打的。”

“好，好，”乞乞科夫想，“如果你真的挨一顿打，那倒实在不坏的。”

“上帝在上！这真的痛得要命！我就醒了；不错，周身都痒；该死的东西，这跳蚤！哦，回去穿起衣服来罢；我就到你那里去。我只要再去申斥一下管家这无赖子就行。”

乞乞科夫回到屋子里，洗过脸，换好了衣服。当他走进食堂去的时候，桌子上已经摆着茶具和一瓶蔗酒了。屋里却还分明的留着昨天的中餐和晚餐的遗迹；使女并没有用过扫帚。地板上散着面包末屑，连桌布上也看见躺着成堆的烟灰。那主人，也就进来了，穿的还是睡衣，下面露着不穿小衫的，生着浓毛的胸脯。一只手拿了长烟管，一只手拿一个杯，喝着，这模样，对于极讨厌理发店招牌上面那样卷起，掠光，或者剪短的头的画家，实在是一个很好的图样。

“那么，你以为怎样？”略停了一会之后，罗士特来夫说。“你不想赌一下魂灵吗？”

“我已经告诉过你了，我不赌；却买——我愿意这样。”

“我不想卖，这不像朋友。莫名其妙的事，我是不干的。赌——那可是另外一回事了。玩牌罢！”

“我已经告诉过你了，我是不赌的。”

“你也不愿意交换吗？”

“我不愿意！”

“唔，那么，听罢，我们来下象棋，好吗？你赢——就都是你的。该从户口册上注销的，我这里有一大批。喂，坡尔菲里！拿象棋盘来！”

“请你不要费神了，我可是不赌的！”

“但这并不是赌博呀；这不讲运气，也不能玩花样，什么都靠真本领的。而且我还得声明，我下得很不行；你应该饶我几著。”

“也许这倒很好的，试试看。”乞乞科夫想。“我先前象棋下得并不坏，况且他要在这里玩花样，也很难的。”

“也好！可以的。我还是和你下一盘象棋罢。”

“魂灵——对一百卢布？好吗？”

“为什么？我想，五十卢布也足够了。”

“不行，你听哪，五十，这不像一注的！还不如我加上一匹普通的猎狗，或者一个金的图章罢，你知道，那就像人们挂在表链上那样的东西。”

“那就是了！我可以来。”乞乞科夫说。

“可是你让我先几子呢？”罗士特来夫问。

“这怎么可以？自然不让先。”

“至少，开手要让我先两子的。”

“不行，我自己也下得很坏。”

“知道了，这下得很坏！”罗士特来夫说着，动了一子。

“我长久没有碰过棋子了。”乞乞科夫说着，也动了一子。

“知道了——这下得很坏。”罗士特来夫说着，又动了一子。

“我长久没有碰过棋子了。”乞乞科夫说着，又走下去。

“知道了——这下得很坏。”罗士特来夫说着，又动了一子，同时又用睡衣的袖口，把别的一子推向前去了。

“我长久没有碰过棋子了……喂，这是怎么的，好朋友？把这一子收回去！”乞乞科夫喊道。

“什么？”

“这一子是你得退回去的。”乞乞科夫说；但他忽然看见在他的鼻子跟前另外还有一子，像是想去吃帅似的。它是怎么来的呢，却只有一个上帝知道。“不行，”乞乞科夫说，“和你，是不能下的。人不能一下子就走三著！”

“怎么三著？这是弄错的。这一子是错带上来的；我退回去，如果你要这样。”

“还有这里的是怎么来的呢？”

“你说的是那一子呀？”

“这里，这一子，这想来吃帅的。”

“你怎么了呀！你好像不明白似的。”

“不，我的好人，棋子我都数过，什么都记的清清楚楚的，你刚刚把它推上来的。这里是它的原位！”

“什么——那里？”罗士特来夫红着脸，说。“你胡说白道，朋友！”

“不的，好人，恐怕正是你胡说白道，但可惜就是运气小。”

“你当我什么人？”罗士特来夫说。“莫非你以为我在玩花样吗？”

“我并没有当你什么人，不过我自己警戒，不再和你下棋了。”

“不成，现在你早不能退走了，”罗士特来夫愤激了起来，“棋已经下开了头的！”

“可是我可以不下，因为你下得不像一个规矩人！”

“你说谎！你没有说出这样话来的权利！”

“不然，我的好人，那倒是你，你说谎的！”

“我没有玩花样，你也不能退开。你得下完这一盘！”

“你强迫我不来的。”乞乞科夫冷冷的说，走近棋局去，把棋子搅乱了。

罗士特来夫怒得满脸通红，奔向乞乞科夫，至于使他倒退了两步。

“我却要强迫你，和我来下棋。你搅乱了棋局，也没有用的。我著著都记得！我们可以把这一局从新摆出来的！”

“不成，我的好人，我不和你下，这就够了！”

“你不下吗？是不？”

“你自己看就是，人是不能和你来下的！”

“不，要说明白：你下，还是不下？”罗士特来夫说着，更加走近乞乞科夫来，碰着了他的身体。

“不下。”乞乞科夫说，一面只得擎起双手，放在脸前，他看情形，已经料到要有一场剧战了。这准备很得当，因为罗士特来夫模样是就要动手的，而且很容易打过来，会使我们的主角的漂亮丰满的脸上，蒙上洗不去的耻辱；然而他把那一击往斜下里架掉了，还紧紧的捏住了罗士特来夫的两只喜欢打架的手。

“坡尔菲里，保甫路式加！”罗士特来夫发疯似的叫喊起来，一面挣脱着。

这一叫喊，乞乞科夫就放掉了他的手，因为他不愿意给仆役目睹这有趣的场面，而且同时觉得，永远扭住着罗士特来夫，也是毫无意思的。这刹那间，坡尔菲里走进屋子里来了，后面跟着保甫路式加，是一个强壮的小子，和他是尝不到好味道的。

“你总不肯下完这一局吗？”罗士特来夫说。“说出来：是，还是不。”

“要下完它，我可做不到。”乞乞科夫说着，向窗外瞥了一眼，他看见自己的马车已经套好，旁边是绥里方，好像只在等候叫他拉到门口来的命令。然而总逃不出这屋子去，因为门口站着两匹强有力的驴子，罗士特来夫的家奴。

“你总不肯下完这一局吗？”罗士特来夫再说一遍，脸上气得通红。

“如果你下得规规矩矩……但是……不下了！”

“不下？你这恶棍！你觉得自己要输了，你就会马上不下了！打他！”他突然暴怒的喊起来，一面转向坡尔菲里和保甫路式加，自己也抓起了他那樱木的长烟管。乞乞科夫白得像一块麻布。他想说些什么，但他只觉得自己的嘴唇在动，却没有发出一点声音。

“打他！”罗士特来夫大叫着，拿了他那樱木的长烟管向他奔来，发红而且流汗，恰如喊着向一个难攻的要塞冲锋一样。“打他！”罗士特来夫用了好像一个狂暴的中尉，正当猛烈的总攻击之际，对他的中队喊道“前进，儿郎们！”似的声音大叫着，这中尉，是以蛮勇获得名望的，当剧战使他无法可想的时候，就只好发这命令。然而战云已经把他弄昏，他觉得周围一切，都在打旋子了。大将斯服罗夫的影子，仿佛就在前面飘浮。重大的目标在那里，他就瞎七瞎八的冲过去。他喊着“前进呀，儿郎们！”但这事怎样的破坏了已经筹定的总攻击的计画，却并不细想，而藏在云间一般的难攻的要塞的墙壁的枪洞里，有几百万枪口，和自己带着的无力的小队，会像轻微的羽毛似的在空中纷飞，以及敌人的枪弹会呼啸着飞来，使这边的叫喊沉默下去之类的事，也并不重视了。然而，就是把罗士特来夫当作一个没头没脑的向要塞冲锋，疯里疯气的中尉似的人物罢，而这被他猛攻的要塞本身，却和那种要塞毫不相像，倒相反，这要塞是感到一种恐怖，连心脏也掉到裤子里去了。他想拿着护身的椅子，已经被家奴们从手里抢去了，他已经闭上眼睛，死比活多，准备用脊梁来挨这家的主人的乞尔开斯的长烟管，另外还要出什么事呢，那可只有上帝知道了。然而福从天降，我们的主角的胁肋，肩膀，以及所有养得很好的各处的皮肉，幸而都没有事。完全出乎意外，突然响起来了，好像天使的声音，是一个铃铛声，驶来的马车的车轮声，连屋里也听得到的三匹跑热了的马的沉重的呼吸声。大家都不禁连忙跑到窗口去。一个留了胡子，穿着军人似的衣服的人，跨下车子来。他在门口问过主人之后，就走进屋子里，其时乞乞科夫还在吓得发昏，也还在凡有垂死的人，总要尝到的可怜之至的状态里。

“我可以问，两位里面谁是罗士特来夫先生么？”那客人问，于是用了诧异的眼光，向手里拿着长烟管，站在那里的罗士特来夫看了一眼，也向刚从他那可悲的状态里开始恢复转来的乞乞科夫看了一眼。“我可以先问，光临的是谁么？”罗士特来夫走近他去，说。

“我是地方法院长！”

“您贵干呢？”

“我这来，为的是通知你一件我所收到的公文。在对于你的未决案件，有了法律的判决之前，你是被告。”

“吓，胡闹！怎样的案件？”罗士特来夫说。

“你牵涉在地主玛克西摩夫的案件里了，你在酩酊状态之际，用杖子打他，给了他人格的侮辱。”

“胡说，我根本就不认识这地主玛克西摩夫。”

“可敬的先生！您要承认我所给您的注意：我是官吏。您可以对您的仆役这么说，却不能对我。”

到这里，乞乞科夫便不再等候罗士特来夫对于这的回答，抓起自己的帽子，从地方法院长的背后溜出门外，坐上他的马车，并且命令绥里方，赶马匹用全速力跑掉了。

第五章


我们的主角却还是担心得很。车子虽然用了撒野的速率在往前跑，罗士特来夫的庄子，已经隐在丘冈，田野，小山后面了，他总还在惴惴的四顾，好像以为就要跳出追兵来似的。他呼吸的很沉重，把手按在心上，就觉得跳得像是一只笼子里的鹌鹑。“我的上帝，真教我出了一身大汗。这东西！”于是他从罗士特来夫本身咒起，一直到他的祖宗。其中确也有几句很不好听的话，但有什么用呢：一个俄国人，又是在生气呀！况且这事情完全不是开玩笑：“无论怎么说，”他对自己道，“如果这局面上没有地方审判厅长出现，恐怕我现在也不能够还在欣赏这美丽的上帝的世界了！恐怕我就要像水泡似的消灭，不留一点我在这世间的痕迹，没有后代，也没有钱财和田地以及好名望传给我的儿子和孙儿了！”我们的主角，实在替他的子孙愁烦得很。

“这么一个坏老爷，”绥里方想，“这样的一个老爷，我一生一世里就还没有看见过。真的，应该对脸上唾他一口。不给人吃，那还可以，可是马却总得喂的呀。因为马是喜欢燕麦的。这就是所谓它的养料；我们要粮食，那么，它就要燕麦。这正是它的养料呵。”

马匹也好像因为罗士特来夫而显着不高兴的态度。不但阿青和议员，连阿花也不快活。虽然它的一份，燕麦一向总比别的两匹少，而且绥里方放进槽去的时候，一定说这一句话：“吃罢，你这废料！”不过这总归是燕麦，并非平常的干草：它便愉快的嚼起来，还时时把它的长脖子伸到两位邻居的槽里去，估量一下它们得到的是怎样的养料。当绥里方不在马房里的时候，它就更加这么干。但这回却都不外乎干草——这是不行的！它们都不满足了。

然而，这不满足，却在它们的悒郁中，被突然的而且意外的事件打断了，当六匹马拉的车子向它们驰来，坐在车里的女人们的喊声和车夫的叫骂声已经到了耳边的时候，这边的一切连着马夫这才心魂归舍。“喂，你这流氓，该死的，我大声的告诉了你：向右让开，老昏蛋！你喝昏了，还是怎的？”绥里方知道自己不对了；但俄国人，是不喜欢在别人面前认错的，他就也威风凛凛的叫道：“你怎么瞎七瞎八的冲过来？！你把你眼珠当在酒店里了罢？”同时他使劲的收紧缰绳，想使车子退后，从纠结中脱开。但是，阿呀，他的努力没有用；马匹由它们的马具叉住了。阿花很觉得新奇似的嗅着在它身边的新朋友。这时坐在车里的女客是忧容满面，看着一切的纠纷。一个已经有了年纪，别一个是十六七岁的姑娘，金色头发，光滑的贴在她小巧的脸上。她那漂亮的脸盘圆得像一个嫩鸡蛋，闪着雪白，透明的光，也正像嫩鸡蛋，在刚从窠里取出，管家女的黑黑的手，拿着映了太阳，查看一下的时光。她那娇嫩的菲薄的耳朵，当被逼人的温热照得潮红时，也在微微的颤动。还有从那张着不动的嘴唇，闪在眼里的泪珠上的受惊的表情，也无不非常漂亮，至于使我们的主角失神的看了几分钟之久，毫不留心车子，马匹和马夫的纠葛了。

“退后！老昏蛋！”那边的马夫向绥里方叫喊道。他勒一勒缰绳，那边的同行也这么办，马匹倒退了几步，但立刻仍旧回上来，那些皮条又从新缠绕起来了。在这样的情境里，那新相知却给了我们的阿花一个很深的印象，至于使它不再想从那因为意外的运命，陷了进去的轮道中走出。它把嘴脸搁在新朋友的脖子上，还似乎在耳朵边悄悄的说些什么事：确是些可怕的无聊事。因为那对手总在摇耳朵。当这大混乱中，从幸而住得并不很远的村子里，有农民们跑来帮忙了。一场这样的把戏，对于农民，实在是一种天惠，恰如他们的日报或聚会之对于德国人一样，车子周围即刻聚集了许多脑袋的堆，只有老婆子和吃奶孩子还剩在家里。人们卸下皮带来，阿花在鼻子上挨了很重的几下，因为要使它退走：一句话，马儿们是拆散，拉开了。但那刚到的马匹，不知道是不愿意和新朋友分离，还是倔强呢——任凭马夫尽量的抽，也总像生了根似的站着。农人们的同情和兴味，大到不可限量了。大家争着挤上来，给些聪明的意见。“去，安特留式加，把右边的马拉一下。米卡衣叔骑在中间的一匹上，上去呀，米卡衣叔！”那又长又瘦的米卡衣叔，是一个红胡须的汉子，便爬在中间的马上了。他就像乡下教堂的钟楼，或者要更确切，就是一个汲井水的瓶子。马夫鞭着马，然而没有效，米卡衣叔也做不出什么大事情。“慢来！慢来！”农人们喊着，“你还是骑到边马上去，米卡衣叔；米念衣叔骑在中间的马上罢！”米念衣叔是一个广肩阔背的农夫，一部漆黑的络腮胡子，那肚子，就像足够给一切市场上受冻的人们来煮甘甜的蜜茶的大茶炊，他高高兴兴的骑在中间马上了，使它为了这重负，几乎要弯到地面。“现在行了。”农人们喊道。“打！打呀。给它一鞭；喂，给这黄马！——为什么要小蜻蜓似的张了腿不听话的。”但一看出做不到，打也无用，米卡衣叔和米念衣叔就都骑在中间这一匹马上，使安特留式加爬到边马上去了。马夫到底也耐不下去了，便双双赶走，米卡衣叔和米念衣叔，都滚他的蛋。这正好，因为马匹好像一息不停的，跑了一站似的正在出大汗。他先给它们喘过气来，它们也就自己拉着车走了。当闹着这事变的时候，乞乞科夫却浸在对于不相识的年青小姐的考察中。他有好几回，想和她去扳谈，然而总是做不出。这之间，那小姐就走掉了，漂亮的头带着标致的脸相，和那苗条的姿态，都消失了，像一个幻景；乞乞科夫又看见了村路，他的马车和读者早已熟识了的三匹马，还有绥里方这一流人，以及四面的空无一物的田野。凡在人间，在粗笨的，冷酷的，穷苦的，在不干净的，发霉的下等人们里，也如在干净的，规矩的，单调的上流人们里一样——无论在那里，我们总会遇到一回向来从未见过的现象，至少也总有一回会燃起向来无与相比的感情。这在我们，就是一道灿烂的光，穿过了用苦恼和不遇所织成的我们的一生的黑暗，恰如黄金作饰，骏马如画，玻窗发闪的辉煌的箱车，在突然间，而且在不意中，驰过了向来只见有看熟的乡下车子经过的寒村一样：农人们就还是张开嘴巴，诧异的站着，不敢戴上帽，虽然那体面的箱车早已远得不见了。这年青的金发小姐在我们的故事里，也就是这样的在突然间而且在不意中出现，又复这样的不见了的。倘使这时并非乞乞科夫，却是一个二十来岁的青年——一个骠骑兵，或是一个大学生，或是一个刚刚上了他那人生之路的平常的凡夫俗子——那么，我的上帝，他会怎样的激昂奋发，他会怎样的魂飞神往呵！他将要久久的痴立在那地方，眼睛望着远处，忘记了道路和旅行的目的，忘记了因为他的迟延而来的一切呵斥和责难，是的，他并且忘记了自己，职务，世界，以及在世界上的一切东西了！

然而我们的主角是已经到了中年，且有一种冷静，镇定，切实的性格的。他也曾沉思了一番，还想到过许多事，但他的思想却是更加着实的东西：他的思想决不如此胡涂，倒是很清楚，很有根据。“一个出色的姑娘！”他说，其时就打开他的鼻烟壶，嗅了一下。“但在她那里，最好的是什么呢……她那最好的是，她好像刚刚从学堂或者女塾毕业，还没有特别的女形女势，这相貌，只使全体显得难看。她现在还是一个孩子，什么都朴实，单纯，想到了就说，高兴了就笑。要使她成为什么还都可以，她能成为一个佳人，却也一样的会变一个废物——会变的，如果请婶子或是妈妈来教育。只要一年，就满是女形女势，连她自己的父亲也会觉得她是别一个人了。她会成一个骄傲的，装腔的人，只在外面的学来的规矩上彷徨，佩服，心思都化在她和什么人，讲什么事以及讲多少话，她怎样瞟她的情人这些事情上；于是骇怕得很，连一句多余的话也不敢说，终于就该做什么也简直不明白了，一生就像是一个大谎在那里逛荡着。呸，妈的！”到这里，他沉默了一会，这才接下去道：“我愿意知道，她是什么人呢？她的父亲是做什么的？是有名望的地主，还不过是一位正人君子，只从办公上积了一点小钱的呢——如果那娃儿带着二十万卢布来——那可就并非不好的——决非不好的货色。一个规矩人，就可以和她享福了。”这二十万卢布对他发着很动人的光芒，使他心里怪起自己来，为什么不在叉车的时候，向马夫问一声她们的名姓呢。但这时梭巴开维支的村庄已经分明可见，他的思想就被赶走，转到他自己的事情上去了。

这庄子，在他看起来是很大的；两面围着白桦和黑松的树林，像是一对翅膀，这一只显得比那一只暗一点；中间站着一所木房子，红色的屋顶，暗灰色的——实在是粗糙的墙壁——恰如我们造给屯田兵和德国移民的房屋一样。一看就知道，关于建筑的设计，建筑家是很和主人的趣味斗争了一下的。建筑家是内行，喜欢两面相称，主人却第一要便利，所以一面的墙壁上，一切通气的窗户都堵塞了，只有一个该在昏暗的堆房上那样的小小的圆窟窿。还有一个破风，虽然建筑家怎样费力，也总不能弄到屋子的中央去；主人一定要把一枝柱子竖在旁边，于是原是四枝的柱子，便见得只有三枝了。前园是用很坚实，粗得出奇的木栅围起来的。到处都显得这家的主人，首先是要牢固和耐久。马房，堆房，厨房，也都用粗壮的木材造成，大约一定可以很经久。农奴的小屋，也造得非常坚牢。没有一处用着雕刻装饰的雕墙，以及别样的儿戏——所有一切，为主的只有一个坚实。就是井干，也用厚实的槲树做成，这种材料，普通是只用于造水磨和船只的。一句话——凡有乞乞科夫所看见的，无不坚固，而且屹然的站在地面上，排排节节，还似乎有着深沉的不可动摇的布置。当马车停在阶沿前面时，乞乞科夫看见了两张脸，几乎同时的从窗子里望出来：一张是女的，狭长到像一条王瓜，裹着头帕，一张是圆圆的男人脸，很大，像那穆尔大比亚的南瓜，就是俄国却叫作“壶卢”，用它来做巴罗拉加，那二弦的轻快的乐器——这在不怕羞，爱玩笑的农家少年们，是荣耀和慰藉，那些修饰齐整的青年，就由此向着那聚到周围，来听妙音的粉头酥胸的姑娘们，使眼色，发欢声的。那两张脸在窗口一瞥之后，就又消失了。一个灰色背心上带着蓝色高领子的家丁，便出到阶沿上，迎乞乞科夫进了大门，主人已经在那里等着。他一看见客人，只简短的道了一声“请”，就引他到里面去了。

当乞乞科夫横眼一瞥梭巴开维支的时候，他这回觉得他好像一匹中等大小的熊。而且仿佛为了完全相像，连他身上的便服也是熊皮色：袖子和裤子都很长，脚上穿着毡靴，所以他的脚步很莽撞，常要踏着别人的脚。他的脸色是通红的，像一个五戈贝克铜钱。谁都知道，这样的脸，在世界上是很多的，对于这特殊的工作，造化不必多费心机，也用不着精细的工具，如磋子，锯子之类，只要简单的劈几斧就成。一下——瞧这里罢，鼻子有了——两下——嘴唇已在适当之处了；再用大锥子在眼睛的地方钻两个洞，这家伙就完全成功。也无须再把他刨平，磨光，就说道“他活着哩”，送到世上去。梭巴开维支也正是这样的一个结实的，随手做成的形相：他的姿势，直比曲少，不过间或转一下他的头，为了这不动，他就当然不很来看和他谈天的对手，却只看着炉角或房门了。当和他一同经过食堂的时候，乞乞科夫再瞥了他一眼，就又心里想：“一只熊，实在完全是一只熊。”而且这是运命的怎样奇特的玩笑呵：他的名字又正叫作米哈尔·绥米诺维支。(1)乞乞科夫是知道梭巴开维支的老脾气，常要踏在别人的脚上的，便走得很小心，总让他走在自己的前面。但那主人似乎也明白他那坏脾气，所以不住的问道：“恐怕我对您有了疏忽之处了罢？”然而乞乞科夫称谢，并且很谦虚的声明，直到现在，他还没有觉得有什么疏忽之处。

他们进得客厅，梭巴开维支指着一把靠椅，又说了一声“请”。乞乞科夫坐下了，但又向挂在壁上的图画看了一眼。全是等身大的钢版像，真正的英勇脚色，即希腊的将军们，如密奥理，凯那黎，毛罗可尔达多等，末一个穿着军服，红裤子，鼻梁上戴眼镜。这些英雄们，都是非常壮大的腰身，非常浓厚的胡子，多看一会，就会令人吓得身上发生鸡皮皱。奇怪的是，在这希腊群雄之间，也来了巴格拉穹(2)公，一个瘦小的人，拿一张小旗儿，脚下是一两尊炮，还嵌在非常之狭的框子里。其次又是希腊的女英雄：罗培里娜，单是一条腿，就比现在挂满在这客厅里的无论那一位阔少的全身还要粗。这家的主人，自己是一个非常健康而且茁壮的人，所以好像也愿意把真正健康而且茁壮的人物挂在他那家里的墙壁上。罗培里娜的旁边，紧靠窗户，还挂着一个鸟笼，有一匹灰色白斑的画眉，在向外窥视，也很像梭巴开维支。主客两位，彼此都默默的坐着不到两分钟，房门开处，这家的主妇，是一位高大的太太，头戴缀着自家染色的带子的头巾，走进来了，她脚步稳重，头笔直，好像一株椰子树。

“这是我的菲杜略·伊凡诺夫娜。”梭巴开维支说。

乞乞科夫就在菲杜略·伊凡诺夫娜的手上接吻，那手，是几乎好像她塞到他嘴里来的一般；由这机会，他知道了她的手是用王瓜水洗的。

“心肝，我可以绍介保甫尔·伊凡诺维支给你么？”梭巴开维支接着说。“我们是在知事和邮政局长那里认识的。”

菲杜略·伊凡诺夫娜请乞乞科夫就坐，她一样的说了一声“请”，把头一动，仿佛扮着女王的女戏子似的。于是她也坐在沙发上，蒙着她毛织的头巾，眼睛和眉毛，从此一动也不动了。

乞乞科夫又向上边一瞥，就又看见了粗腰身，大胡子的凯那黎，罗培里娜以及装着画眉的鸟笼子。

大约有五分钟，大家都守着严肃的沉默，来打破的只有画眉去吃几粒面包屑，用嘴啄着鸟笼的木板底子的声音。乞乞科夫又在屋子里看了一转：这里的东西也无不做得笨重，坚牢，什么都出格的和这家的主人非常相像。客厅角上有一张胖大的写字桌，四条特别稳重的腿——真是一头熊。凡有桌子，椅子，靠椅——全都带着一种沉重而又不安的性质，每种东西，每把椅子，仿佛都要说：“我也是一个梭巴开维支。”或者“我也像梭巴开维支。”

“我们在审判厅长伊凡·格里戈利也维支那里，谈起了您呢。”乞乞科夫看见在场的人谁也没有开口模样，终于说。“那是上一个礼拜四了。我在那里过了很愉快的一晚上。”

“是的！那一回我没有到审判厅长那里去。”梭巴开维支道。

“是一位很体面的人物，不是吗？”

“您说谁呀？”梭巴开维支说，看着暖炉角。

“说审判厅长！”

“在您，恐怕是会觉得这样的；他其实是共济会员，可又是世上无双的驴子。”

乞乞科夫一听到这过份的评论，颇有点仓皇失措了，但他即刻又有了把握，于是马上接下去道：“自然，人总是各有他的弱点的；但可对呢？那知事，却是一位很出色的人罢？”

“怎么？那知事——一位出色的人？”

“是的！我说得不对吗？”

“是强盗，像他的找不出第二个。”

“怎么？——知事是一个强盗？”乞乞科夫说，怎么知事会入了强盗伙，他简直不能懂。“我老实说，这可实在是没有想到的。”他接着道。“但请您许我提几句：他的行为，却全不是这一类；倒可以说，他有很温和的性格。”作为证据，他还拉出知事亲手绣成的钱袋来，并且竭力赞扬了他那可亲的脸相。

“然而这可就是强盗脸呀！”梭巴开维支说。“您给他一把刀拿在手里，送他到街上去——他就杀掉您，毫无情面——只为一文小钱，他和那副知事——是真真正正的——戈格和玛戈格(3)。”

“唔，他和他们大约有些不对的，”乞乞科夫想，“我还是和他谈谈警察局长罢，那人，我看起来，是他的朋友。”——“但是，照我看来，”他说道，“老实说，我觉得警察局长是最惬人意了。多么直爽坦白的性格；他很有点质朴，诚实。”

“是一个骗子！”梭巴开维支很冷静的说。“他有本领，会先来骗了您，卖了您，又立刻和您一同吃中饭。我知道他们：真正的骗贼。全市镇就是这模样；这一个骗贼骑住了别一个，追捕着他们的还有第三个，全都是犹大，卑鄙的奸细。还有点什么用处的只有一个推事——不过到底也还是一只猪。”

在这些虽然略短，却是好意的传记的评论之后，乞乞科夫觉得其余的官员们的叙述，也不大记得起来了，而且他悟到，梭巴开维支是不喜欢说人们一点好处的。

“你看怎么样，心肝，我们去坐起来？”梭巴开维支夫人对她的男人说。

“请。”梭巴开维支说着，就走向菜桌那里去；照着古来的好习惯，主客各先喝过一杯烧酒，并且吃起来，这是广大的俄罗斯全国里，无论城乡，在中饭之前，总是豫备的先是各种咸渍和开胃食品的小吃，——然后大家都到食堂去。主妇走在最前面，好像一匹浮水的天鹅。小小的桌子上，摆着四个人的刀叉。那第四位上，立刻有一个人坐下去了，要说这人，是颇不容易的，她究竟是什么呢：是太太还是姑娘，是亲戚，是管家妇，还不过是住在这家里的女人呢——她大约三十岁，没有头巾，用一条花布围巾披在肩膀上。在这世界上，是有这样的创造物的，她并非独立的存在，倒仅仅是别个上面的一个斑，一个点。她总是坐在同一的地方，头总是保着同一的姿势；人们拿她当家私什物看，也想不到她在一生中，会张开嘴来说句话；倘要相信她会笑，倒是得到使女屋子或是堆房里去观察的。

“今天的菜汤很出色，我的宝贝。”梭巴开维支喝着汤，一面说，一面又拿过一大块包肚来，这有名的食品，普通是和菜汤同吃，用荞麦粥，脑子，蹄子肉，灌在羊胃里做成的。“这样的包肚，”他又转向着乞乞科夫，接续说，“您走遍全市也找不出；在那里，鬼知道卖给您的是什么呢！”

“但在知事那里，倒也吃的很不坏。”乞乞科夫道。

“是的，那么，您可知道，那东西是怎么做的呢？您一知道，可就不要吃了！”

“那东西是怎么做的，我自然不能明白；但那猪排和鱼，却出色的。”

“在您，恐怕是会觉得这样的。我很知道他们在市场上买东西的事情。厨子这坏蛋，受了一个法国人的指教，就只买一只老雄猫，剥掉皮，当作兔子用。”

“呸！你说的是多么讨厌的事情呀！”梭巴开维支的太太说。

“叫我有什么法子呢，宝贝？他们那里，就是这么干的呀；他们惯是这么干，可不是我不好呀。所有末屑，我们的亚库拉是就教抛到垃圾桶里去的，他们却拿它来做汤。总是做汤，统统做汤。”

“在食桌上，你总说些这样的事！”梭巴开维支太太抗议道。

“这有什么要紧呢，宝贝？”梭巴开维支说。“如果我自己也是这样子呢，然而我爽爽快快的告诉你：这样的脏东西，我可是不吃的。青蛙，即使是糖煮的，我不吃，蛎黄也一样；蛎黄看起来好像什么，我明白得很。请您再用一块烧羊肉，”他向着乞乞科夫，接续说，“这是羊后身加粥，不是斯文的绅士们喜欢吃的，用市场上躺了四天的羊肉做出来的肉饼子。那都是德国呀，法国呀的医生先生们想出来的计策；因此我真想统统绞死掉他们。节食法——也是他们的发明。好法子——用饿肚子来治病。因为他们自己是又乏又躁的体子，就以为俄国人的肚子，也只要这么办一下就成。那里，这统统是不对的——这是真正的胡闹，这统统是……”于是梭巴开维支气忿地摇摇头。“他们总在说什么文明，但他们的文明却不过是一个……哼……！我几乎要说出口来了，但这样的话，吃饭时候是不该说的。我这里却完全不一样。我这里呢，如果是烧猪或烧鹅，那就拿出一只全猪或全鹅来。我宁可只有两样菜，不过要给我吃一个饱，直到心满意足。”梭巴开维支就用着实行，鲜明地支持了他的言论：他拿半爿羊脊肋放在盘子里，吃了下去，连骨头也嚼一通，直到一点也不剩。

“哦，哦，”乞乞科夫想，“他也知道什么是上算的。”

“我这里却完全不一样，”梭巴开维支用饭单擦着手，说，“我不是那什么泼留希金；他有八百个魂灵，那过活和吃喝，却比我们的看牛人还要坏。”

“这泼留希金是什么人呢？”乞乞科夫问。

“是一个贱种，”梭巴开维支说，“这样的吝啬鬼，人是想也想不到的。囚犯的生活，也还是比他好：他把他所有的家伙都饿死了。”

“真的？”乞乞科夫显着同情的样子，插嘴说。“这是真的么，像您说过，他那里饿死了很多的农奴？”

“像蝇子一样。”

“不，真的么？像蝇子一样？我可以问一下，他家离这里有多远吗？”

“大约五维尔斯他罢。”

“五维尔斯他！”乞乞科夫叫了出来，还觉得他的心有点跳了。“如果从这里的大门出去，他的庄子在右边，还是在左边呢？”

“去找这狗的道儿，您还是全不知道好！我通知您，您倒不如不要关心他罢，”梭巴开维支说，“如果有谁到不成体统的地方去，比去找他倒还情有可原哩。”

“不，我也并不是有什么目的，在这里打听的。我单是问问，因为对于风土人情，我是有很大的兴味的。”

羊后身之后，来了干酪饼，每个都比盘子还要大，于是又来一只小牛般大的火鸡，塞满着各种好东西：白米，鸡蛋，肝，以及只有上帝知道的别的什么，都夹着装在肚子里，好像一个核。中饭这算是收场了；但当站了起来时，乞乞科夫觉得自己加重了整整一普特。大家又走进客厅去，却已经有一盘果酱，摆在桌上了；——然而不是梨子，不是李子，也不是什么莓子的——但主客两面，谁也没有去碰一碰。主妇走出去了，要再取几样果酱来。趁这机会，乞乞科夫就转脸向了梭巴开维支，他却埋在一把靠椅里，只是哼；他饱透了；嘴巴一开一闭的，吐出几声不清楚的声音来，用手画过十字，就又去掩住了嘴巴。但乞乞科夫转向了他，说道：“有一点事情，我很愿意和您谈一谈！”

“您不再用一点蜜饯么？”主妇又拿了一个果碟来，说。“这是萝卜片，蜜煮的！”

“慢慢的！”梭巴开维支说。“现在进去罢，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支和我，我们要脱了外套，休息一下子了！”

那主妇又立刻要叫人去拿垫子和枕头，但梭巴开维支却道：“不必，我们已经坐在靠椅上。”于是他的太太就走掉了。

梭巴开维支略略伸长着脖子，准备来听是怎样的事情。

乞乞科夫绕得很远，首先是通论俄国的广大，他竟无法称赞，恐怕古代的罗马帝国，也未必有这么大，外国人觉得诧异，是一点都不错的……（梭巴开维支仍然伸着脖子，倾听着。）而且看这光荣无比的国度里的现行的法律，还有登在人口册上，即使他已经不在这世上生活了，但在下次的新的人口调查之前，却还当作活着一样看待的农奴；这自然为的是不给衙门去多担任无聊的无益的调查，也就是省掉事务上的烦杂，因为虽是没有这么办，国家机关也已经足够烦杂了……（梭巴开维支仍然伸着脖子，倾听着。）但要知道，这方法好固然好，不过总不免使多蓄农奴的人，有了很重的负担，因为他们还得缴已经不在了的农奴的人头税，和活着的相同。但是他自己，乞乞科夫，对于他梭巴开维支是怀着万分敬仰之意的，所以很愿意来分任一点这沉重的义务。关于主要之点，乞乞科夫是说得非常留心的，而且也不说死掉的，却只说“不在的”农奴。

梭巴开维支仍然略略伸长了脖子，坐着，听是听的，但脸上竟毫不露出一点什么的表情。几乎令人疑心对着一个不活的，或是没有魂灵的人，否则虽有魂灵，也不在身子里，恰如那不死的可希牵(4)似的，远在什么地方的山阴谷后，还带着一个厚壳，里面即使怎么震动，外面也绝无影响了。

“那么？”乞乞科夫问道，有些藏不住心里的焦急，等着回答。

“您要死掉了的魂灵么？”梭巴开维支很平静的说，绝无惊疑之色，好像说着萝卜白菜似的。

“对啦，”他又想把话说得含胡一点，便添上一句道，“那些已经不在的。”

“那是有的，有的是！怎么会没有呢？”梭巴开维支说。

“唔，是罢？您既然有，那么，您一定是很愿意脱手的罢？”

“可以！我是很愿意卖给您的。”梭巴开维支说，还把头一抬。他分明已经看穿这买主是要去赚一笔大钱的了。

“畜生！”乞乞科夫心里想。“这家伙倒要卖给我了，我还一句也没有提呢！”于是提高声音道：“那么，可否问一下，您要卖多少呢？虽然……这样的货色……也很难定出价钱来。……”

“那么，克己一点：每只一百卢布罢。”梭巴开维支说。

“一百卢布！”乞乞科夫叫起来了，他张开了嘴巴，吃惊的看着梭巴开维支的脸；他已经摸不清，是自己听错了呢，还是梭巴开维支的舌头向来不方便，原是想说别一句的，却说了这样的一句了。

“哦，您以为太贵么，”梭巴开维支说，又立刻接下去道，“那么，您出什么价钱呢？”

“我的价钱？我看我们是有点缠错的，或者彼此都还没有懂，而且，忘记了说的是什么货色。干干脆脆。我说，八十戈贝克——这是最高价了。”

“天哪！这成什么话！八十戈贝克？”

“可不是么？我看是只能出到八十戈贝克的。”

“我不是在卖草鞋呀！”

“但您也得明白，这也并不是人。”

“哦，您以为您能找到谁，会二十戈贝克一个，把注册的魂灵卖给您的吗？”

“不然，请您原谅，您为什么还说‘注册’呢？魂灵是早已死掉了的。剩着的不过是想象上的抓不住的一句话。但是，为了省得多费口舌，我就给您一个半卢布，一文不添。”

“您可真是不顾面子，竟会说出这样的数目来！请您老老实实，还一个实价！”

“这不能，米哈尔·绥米诺维支；实在不能了！做不到的事，总归做不到的。”乞乞科夫说，但因了策略，立刻又添了五十戈贝克。

“为什么您要这么俭省的呢，”梭巴开维支说，“这可真的不贵呵。您如果遇到了别人，他会狠狠的敲您一下，给您的并不是魂灵，倒是什么废物。您从我这里拿去的，却是真正的挑选过的茁实的好脚色，都是手艺人和有力气的种田人。您要知道，例如米锡耶夫罢，他是造车子的，专造带弹簧的车子，而且决不是只好用一个钟头的莫斯科生活。决不是的，凡是他做出来的，都结结实实；他做车子，还自己装，自己漆哩。”

乞乞科夫提出抗议来，说这米锡耶夫可是早已不在这世界上了，然而梭巴开维支讲开了兴头，总是瀑布似的滔滔不绝。

“还有那木匠斯台班·泼罗勃加呢？我拿我的脑袋来赌，您一定找不出更好的工人来。如果他去当禁卫军——是再好也没有的！身长七尺一寸！”

乞乞科夫又想提出抗议，说这泼罗勃加是也不在这世界上的了；然而梭巴开维支讲得出了神。他的雄辩仿佛潺潺的溪流一般奔下来，至于令人乐于倾听。

“还有弥卢锡金，那泥水匠，会给您装火炉，只要您愿意装在什么地方，那一家都可以。或者玛克辛·台略忒尼科夫，靴匠：锥子一钻，一双长靴就成功了；而且是怎样的长靴呀！他并且滴酒不喝。还有耶来美·梭罗可泼聊辛哩！他一个，就比所有的人们有价值。他是在莫斯科做工的，单是人头税，每年就得付五百个卢布。这都是些脚色呀！和什么泼留希金卖出来的废物，是不同的。”

“但请您原谅，”给这好像不肯收梢的言语的洪水冲昏了的乞乞科夫，终于说，“您给我讲他们的本领干什么呢？现在是什么意思也没有了。他们是死了的人呀！俗谚里说的有，死人只好吓鸟儿。”

“他们自然是死了的，”梭巴开维支说，好像他这才醒悟，明白了他们确是死人一样，但即刻说下去道，“但所谓活人，是些什么东西呢？那是苍蝇，不是人。”

“不过那至少是活的！您说的那些，却究竟单单是一个幻影。”

“阿，不然，决不是幻影；我告诉您，这样的一个家伙，像米锡耶夫的，您就很不容易找到第二个；这样的一个工匠，是不到您这屋子里来的。不然，决不是幻影。这家伙肩膀上有力量，连马也比不上。您在别处还见过这样的一个幻影吗，我倒愿意知道知道。”说到末一句，他已经不再向着乞乞科夫，却向了挂在墙上的可罗可尔德罗尼和巴格拉穹的画像了，这在彼此谈论之际，是常有的，不知道为了什么缘故，一个忽然不再看着对手，就是批评他的议论的人，却转向了偶然走来，也许他全不相识的第三者，虽然他明知道不会得到赞同的回答，或者意见，或者表示的。然而他把眼光注在他上面，好像招他来做判断人模样，于是这第三者就有点惶恐，他竟来回答这并未听到的问题好，还是宁可守着礼节，先站一下，然后走掉的好呢，连自己也难以决定了。

“不成，两卢布以上，我是不出的。”乞乞科夫说。

“好罢，因为免得您说我讨得太多，您简直还得太少，那就是了，就七十五个卢布一只——但是要钞票的——卖给您罢。看朋友面上。”

“这家伙在耍什么呀，”乞乞科夫想，“他在把我当驴子看待哩！”于是他说出来道：“这可真真奇特，看起来，几乎好像我们是在这里玩把戏，演喜剧似的。我是说不出别的什么来了，您显得是一位聪明人，一切教养都有。在商量的是什么物事呢？这不过是——嘘——一个真正的空虚！这有什么价值，这有谁要？！”

“但是您在想买；那么，您一定是要的了！”这时乞乞科夫只好咬咬嘴唇，找不出回答。他喃喃的讲了一点家里的情形，梭巴开维支却不过声明道：

“我全不想知道您府上的情形；我不来参与家务——这是您个人的事，您要魂灵，我就来卖给您。在我这里不买，您是要后悔的。”

“两卢布。”乞乞科夫说。

“唉唉，您竟是这样的一个人！像俗谚里说的，黄莺儿总唱着这一曲。咬住了两卢布，简直再也放不掉了。您给一个克实价钱罢。”

“吓，这该死的东西！”乞乞科夫想。“不要紧，我就再添上半个卢布罢，给这猪狗，使他可以好一些。”——“那就是了，我给您两个半卢布！”

“很好，那么，我也给您一个最后的价钱：五十卢布！这还是我吃亏，这样出色的家伙，您想便宜是弄不到手的！”

“这可真是一个吝啬鬼！”乞乞科夫想，于是不高兴的说下去道：“那不行，您听一下罢！您的模样，好像真在这里商量什么紧要事似的！这东西，别人是会送给我的。我到处可以弄到，用不着化钱，因为如果能够脱手，谁都高兴。只有真正老牌的驴子这才愿意留着，还给他们去纳税的。”

“不过您可也知道，这样的买卖——这是只有我们俩，并且为了交情，这才说说的——是并不准许的呢？假如我，或者别的谁讲了出去的话，这买客的信用就要扫地；谁也不肯再来和他订约，他想要恢复他的地位，也就非常困难了。”

“瞧罢，瞧罢，他就在想这样，这地痞！”乞乞科夫想，但他的主意并没有乱，一面用了最大的冷静，声明道：“您料的全不错；我到您这里来买这废物，倒并不是拿去做什么用，不过为了一种兴趣，由于我自己生成的脾气的。如果两卢布半您还觉得太少，那么，我们不谈罢。再见！”

“放他不得！他不大肯添了。”梭巴开维支想。“好罢，上帝保佑您，您每个给三十卢布，就统统归您了。”

“不成，我看起来，您是并不想卖的；再见再见。”

“对不起，对不起。”梭巴开维支说着，不放开他的手，并且踏着他的脚；我们的主角忘记留心了，那报应，便是现在发一声喊，一只脚跳了起来。

“对不起的很。我看我对您有些疏忽了。您请坐呀，那边，请请。”他领乞乞科夫到一把躺椅那里去，教他坐下了。他的举动，有几手竟是很老练的，恰如一匹已经和人们混熟，会翻几个筋斗，倘对它说：“米莎，学一下呀，娘儿们洗澡和小孩子偷胡桃是怎样的？”它也就会做几种把戏的熊一样。

“不行，真的，我把时光白糟蹋了。我得走了，我忙哩！”

“请您再稍稍等一下。我就要和您讲几句您喜欢听的话了。”梭巴开维支于是挨近他来，靠耳朵边悄悄的说，好像在通知一种秘密。“四开，怎样呢？”

“您是说二十五卢布吗？不行，不行，不行！再四开也不行。一文不添的。”

梭巴开维支不回答，乞乞科夫也不开口。这静默大约继续了两分钟。巴格拉穹公用了最大的注意，从墙壁上的自己的位置上，凝视着这交易。

“那么，您到底肯出多少呢？”梭巴开维支说。

“两卢布半！”

“一到您这里，一个人的魂灵就同熟萝卜差不多了。至少，您出三卢布罢！”

“我看办不到。”

“我卖掉罢，自己吃点亏！但这有什么法子呢？我是有狗似的好性情的。我不会别的，只是总想给我的邻舍一点小欢喜。我们还得立一个合同，事情那就妥当了。”

“自然！”

“您瞧，我们还得上市镇去哩！”

于是交易成功了。决定明天就到市里去，给这交易一个结束。

乞乞科夫要农奴们的名册。梭巴开维支是赞成的；他走到写字桌前面，去写出魂灵来，不但姓名，还历举着他们的特色。这时乞乞科夫没有事情做，便考察着这家主人的大块的后影。当看见阔到活像短小精悍的瓦加忒马背的他的脊梁，很近乎一对路旁铁柱的他的两脚的时候，他就禁不住要叫起来道：

“敬爱的上帝的做起你来，可是太浪费了，真可以引了俗谚来说：裁得坏，缝得好。你生下来就是这样的熊，还是草莽生活，田园事务，以及和农奴们的麻烦，使你变成现在似的杀人凶手的呢；并不是的，我相信，即使你在彼得堡受了簇新的，时式的教育，刚刚放下，或者你一生都住在彼得堡，不到田野里来过活，你也总还是一个这样的人。所有的区别，不过你现在是嚼完半身羊脊肋和粥之后，再来一个盘子般大的干酪饼，在那地方呢，却在中饭时候，吃些牛排加香菇。你现在稳稳当当的管理着你的农奴，对他们很和气，自然也不使他们有病痛，挨穷苦。他们都是你的私产，倘用了别样的办法，倒是你自己受损的。但在都会里，你所管理的却是你竭力欺压的公务人员了，你知道他们并不是你的家奴，于是你就从金元抢到纸票。如果谁有一个鬼拳头，你不能把它摊成毛爪子。你也能挖开他一两个指头来的，但这鬼就更加坏。他先从什么艺术或科学上去喝过一两滴，于是飘到出众的社会地位上来了，那么，真懂一点这艺术或科学的人，就要倒运；后来他还要对你说哩：我要来给你们看看，我是什么人。于是他忽然给你们一个大踏步走的聪明透顶的规则，消灭了许多耳闻目见。唉唉！如果统统是这杀人凶手……”

“册子写好了。”梭巴开维支转过头来，说。

“写好了？那就请您给我罢！”他大略一看，惊奇了起来，这造得真是很完备，很仔细；不但那职务，手艺，年龄和家景，都写得很周到，册边上还有备考，记着经历，品行之类。总而言之，看看册子，就是一种大快乐。

“那么，请您付一点定钱。”梭巴开维支说。

“为什么要定钱？到市里，就全部付给您了。”

“哪，您要知道，这是老例。”梭巴开维支反驳道。

“这怎么好呢？偏偏我没有带钱。但这里，请您收这十卢布！”

“唉唉，什么，十个，您至少先付五十！”

乞乞科夫样样的推诿，说他身边并没有这许多钱；但梭巴开维支坚决的申说，以为他其实是有的，终于使他只好从衣袋里掏出一张钞票来，说道：“哪，可以！这里再给您十五卢布。一总是二十五卢布。请您写一张收条。”

“为什么要收条？”

“您知道，这就稳当些！好事多磨！会有种种变化的。”

“好的，那么您拿钱来呀！”

“怎的？钱在我手里呢。您先写好收条，立刻都是您的了。”

“唔，请您原谅，这可叫我怎么能写呢？我总得先看一看钱。”

乞乞科夫交出钞票去，梭巴开维支连忙接住。他走到桌子前面，左手的两个指头按住钞票，用别一只手在纸条上写了他收到卖出魂灵的帝国银行钞票二十五卢布正。写好收条之后，他又把钞票检查了一番。

“这一张旧一点，”当他拿一张钞票向阳光照着的时候，自己喃喃的说，“也破一点，用烂了。但看朋友交情上，这就不必计较罢。”

“一个吝啬鬼！我敢说，”乞乞科夫想，“而且是畜生！”

“您不要女性的魂灵吗？”

“谢谢您，我不要。”

“价钱便宜。看和您的朋友交情上，一只只要一卢布。”

“不，我没有想要女性的意思。”

“当然，如果这样，那就怎么说也没有用。嗜好是没法争执的：谚语里也说，有的爱和尚，有的爱尼姑。”

“我还要拜托您一件事，这回的事情，只好我们两个人知道。”当告别之际，乞乞科夫说。

“那还用说吗！两个好朋友相信得过，彼此所做的事，自然只该以他们自己为限，一个第三者是全不必管的。再见！我谢谢您的光临，还请您此后也不要忘记我！如果有工夫，您再来罢，再吃一回中饭，我们还谈谈闲天。也许还会有什么事，要大家商量商量的。”

“谢谢你，不来了，我的好家伙！”乞乞科夫坐上车，心里想。“一个死魂灵骗了我两个半卢布，这该死的恶霸！”

乞乞科夫很气忿梭巴开维支的态度。他总要算是自己的熟人了。在知事和警察局长那里，他们早经会过面，但他却像完全陌生人一样的来对付他，还用那样的废物弄他的钱去。当车子拉出大门口时，他再回顾了一下：梭巴开维支却还站在阶沿上，像在侦察客人走向那一方面去似的。

“他还站着，这流氓！”乞乞科夫在嘴里喃喃的说；他就吩咐绥里方，向着农村那面转弯，使地主府上再也不能望见这车子。他的主意，是在去找泼留希金的，据梭巴开维支说，那里的人是死得像苍蝇一样。然而他不愿意梭巴开维支知道这件事。车子一到村口，他就把最先遇到的农夫叫到自己这边来。这人刚在路上拾了一棵很粗的木材，扛在肩上，像不会疲倦的蚂蚁似的，想拖到自己的小屋子里去。

“喂！长胡子！从这里到泼留希金家去，是怎么走的，还得不要走过主人家的住宅。”

这问题，对于他好像有点难。

“哪，你不知道吗？”

“是的，老爷，我不知道。”

“唉，你！可是这家伙头发倒已经花白了！连给他的人们挨饿的吝啬鬼泼留希金都不知道。”

“哦，原来，那打补钉的！”那农人叫了起来。在这“打补钉的”的形容词之下，他还接着一个很惬当的名词，但我们从略，因为在较上流的人们的话里，这是用得很少的。然而这表现的非常精确，却并不难于推察，因为车子已经走了一大段路，坐客也早已看不见那农夫了，乞乞科夫还是笑个不住。俄罗斯国民的表现法，是有一种很强的力量的。对谁一想出一句这样的话，就立刻一传十，十传百；他无论在办事，在退休，到彼得堡，到世界的尽头，总得背在身上走。即使造许多口实，用任何方法，想抬高自己的诨名，化许多钱，请那塞饱了的秘书从古代的公侯世家里找了出来，也完全无济于事。你的诨名却无须你帮忙，就会放开了乌鸦喉咙，清清楚楚的报告了这鸟儿是出于那一族的。一句惬当的说出的言语，和黑字印在白纸上相同。用斧头也劈不掉。凡从并不夹杂德国人，芬兰人，以及别的民族，只住着纯粹，活泼，勇敢的俄罗斯人的俄国的最深的深处所发生的言语，都精确得出奇，他并不长久的找寻着适宜的字句，像母鸡抱蛋，却只要一下子，就如一张长期的旅行护照一样，通行全世界了。在这里，你再也用不着加上什么去，说你的鼻子怎么样，嘴唇怎么样，只一笔，就钩勒了你，从头顶一直到脚跟。

恰如虔诚的神圣的俄国，散满着数不清的带着尖顶，圆顶，十字架的修道院和教堂一样，在地母的面上，也碰撞，拥挤，闪烁，汹涌着无数群的国民，种族和民族。而这些民族，又各保有其相当的力量，得着创造的精力，有着分明的特征以及别样的天惠，由此显出它固有的特色来，在一句表现事物的话里，就反映着他那特有性格的一部份。我们在不列颠人的话里，听到切实的认识和深邃的世故；法兰西人的话，是轻飘飘地飞扬，豪华地发闪，短命地迸散的；德意志人则聪明而狡猾地造出了他那不易捉摸的干燥的谜语；但没有一种言语，能这么远扬，这么大胆地从心的最深的深处流出，这么从最内面的生活沸腾，赤热，跃动，像精确的原来的俄罗斯那样的。

在很久，很久的时候以前，在我的儿时，在我的不可再得的消逝了的儿时，如果经过陌生的处所，无论是小村，是贫瘠的村镇，是城邑，是很大的市街，总一样的使我很高兴。孩子的好奇的眼光，在这里会发见出许多有趣的东西来！所有建筑，凡是带着显豁的特色的，都使孩子留心，在精神上给以深刻的印象。高出于居民的木造楼房堆里的，名建筑家所造的装着许多饰窗的一所石叠房屋或公署，高出于雪白的新的教堂之上的，一个圆整的，包着白马口铁的圆屋顶，一个小菜场，一个在市上逛荡的乡下阔少——都逃不出非常注意的儿童的嗅觉——我把鼻子伸到我的幕车外面去，新奇的看着那剪裁法为我从未见过的外衣，看着开口的木箱装些硫黄华，钉子，肥皂和葡萄干，在小菜铺门口的满盛着干了的莫斯科点心的瓶盒间远远的发闪；或者凝视着一个走过的，由一种稀奇的宿命，送他到这乡下的寂寞中来的步兵官长，或是凝视着坐在竞赛马车里，赶上了我的一个身穿长袍子的商人——并且使我想得很远，一直到他们的可怜的生活。一个小市上的官员从身旁走过，我就梦想，推究了起来：他究竟到那里去呢？他去赴他兄弟家里的夜会，还不过是回家，在自家门口闲坐半点钟，到了昏暗，才和夫人，母亲，小姨，以及所有家眷去吃那迟了的晚膳呢？吃过汤之后，戴着珠圈的娃儿或是身穿宽大的家常背心的孩子，拿了传世已久的烛台来，点上油脂烛火的时候，他们会谈些什么呢？临近什么地方的地主的村庄时，我就新奇的看着狭长的木造的钟楼，或者陈旧的木造的教堂。一望见地主家的红色的屋顶和白色的烟囱在树木的密叶间闪烁，那么，我只焦急的等着它从园林的遮蔽中出现，在我眼前显露了全不荒凉或全然无趣的面貌的一瞬息了。于是我又加以推测，这地主是怎样的人，胖的还是瘦的，有儿子还是半打的女儿，全家就和她们那响亮的处女的笑声，她们那处女的游戏和玩乐过活，一群快活的处女，有着永驻的美丽和青春；她们是否黑眼珠，而主人自己，又是否会玩笑，或者正像写在他簿子上和历本上的九月之末一样，仅是阴郁的，偏执的看人，而且，唉唉！除了青年听得很是无聊的麦或小麦之外，再也不谈别事的呢？

现在我却淡然的经过陌生的村庄，漠然的看着它困穷的外貌，我的冷掉了的眼光里不再有所眷恋，也没有东西使我欢乐，像先前的过去的时光，使我的脸有一动弹，一微笑，使我的嘴迸出不竭的言论了，它现在在我面前瞥然而过，而冷淡的沉默，却封锁了我的嘴唇。唉唉，我的儿时，唉唉，我的蓬勃的朝气！

当乞乞科夫正在沉思，暗笑着农夫们赠给泼留希金的出色的诨名的时候，他竟全未想到，那车子已经驶进一个有着许多道路和房屋的，又大又长的村子中央了。但铺着树干的木路给他很有力的一震，立刻使他醒悟过来，和这一比，市上的铺道就成了真的儿戏。这里的树干，是能一高一低，好像钢琴的键盘的，旅客倘不小心，随时可在后头部得一个疙瘩，前额上来一块青斑，或者简直由自己的牙齿咬了舌尖，也不是我们这人间世的最大快意事。农奴小屋都显着衰朽的景象。木材是虫蛀，而且旧到灰色的。许多屋顶好像一面筛。有些是除了椽子之外，看不见屋盖，其间有几枝横档，仿佛骨架上的肋骨一样。显然是屋子的主人经了精确的思索，自己把屋顶板和天花板都抽去了，因为如果下雨，小屋的屋顶也不济，如果天气好，那就一滴也不会漏下来的，况且和老婆睡在炕床上，也毫无道理，可睡的地方另外多得很：酒店里，街路上——一言以蔽之，惟汝心之所如。到处没有窗玻璃。间或用布片或破衣塞着窗洞。檐下的带着栏干的小晒台，不知道为什么缘故，俄国的许多农家是常有的，却都已倾斜，陈旧了，连油漆也剥落得干干净净。小屋后面，看见好些地方躺着麦束堆的长排，分明长久没有动：那颜色，就像一块陈年的烧得不好的砖头，堆上生出各种的野草，旁边盘着蔓草根。麦是大约属于地主的；由车子的变换方向，在麦束堆和烂屋顶后面，看见两个乡下教堂的尖塔，忽左忽右的指着晴空中。这两塔彼此很接近，一个木造，别一个是石造的，刷黄的墙壁，显着大块的斑痕和开口的裂缝。时时望见了地主的住宅，到得小屋串子已经完结，换了围着又低又破的篱垣，好像蔬圃或是菜园的处所，这才分明的站在眼前了。这长到无穷的城堡，看去好像一个跌倒的老弱的残兵。有些是一层楼，也有两层的。在没有周到的保护它的年纪的昏沉的屋顶上，见有两个恰恰相对的望台，都已经歪斜，褪色，曾经刷过的颜色，早已无踪无影了。屋子的墙上，处处露出落了石灰的格子来。这分明是久经了暴雨，旋风，坏天气和秋老虎的侵袭。窗户只有两个是开的；其余的都关着罩窗，或是竟钉上了木板。但连这两个开着的窗也还有一点瞎，一个窗上贴着三角形的蓝色纸。

住宅后面，有一个广大而古老的园，由宅后穿过村子，通到野地里，虽然也荒凉，芜秽了，但独独有些生气，在这广大的村庄和它那如画的野趣里，显着美妙的风姿。在大自然中，树木的交错的枝梢，繁盛地伸展开来的好像颤动的叶子织成的不整的穹门和碧绿的云，停在清朗的蔚蓝的天下。一株极大的白桦，被暴风或霹雳折去了树顶，那粗壮的白色的干子，从这万绿丛中挺然而出，在空中圆得恰如修长美丽的大理石柱一般。但并无柱头，却是很斜的断疤，在雪白的底子上，看去像是一顶帽或者一匹黑色的禽鸟。绿闪闪的蛇麻的丛蔓，要从接骨木，山薇，榛树的紧密的拥抱中钻出，延上树干去，终于绕住了一株半裂的白桦。到得一半，它又挂下来了，想抓着别株的树梢，或者将长长的卷须悬在空中，那小钩卷成圆圈，在软风中摇动。受着明朗的阳光的碧林，有几处彼此分离开来，显出黑沉沉的深洞，仿佛一个打着呵欠的怕人的虎口；这是全藏在黑荫中的，在这昏暗的深处依稀可见的东西，人只能猜出是：一条狭窄的小路，一些倒坏了的栏干，一个快要倒掉的亭子，一株烂空的柳树干，紧靠柳树背后，露着银灰色的树丛，纵横交错的散乱在荒芜中的枯枝和枯叶，还有一株幼小的枫树，把它那碧绿的纷披的叶子伸得远远的，不知道取的是什么路，一枝上竟有一道日光，化为透明的金光灿烂的星，在浓密的昏黑中煌然发闪。园的尽头，有几株比别的树木长得更高的白杨树，抖动着的树顶上架着几个很大的乌鸦窠。白杨之中，一株有折断的枝条，却还没有全断，带了枯叶凄凉的挂着。总而言之，一切都很美，但这美，单由造化或单由人力是都不能成就的，大抵只在造化在人类的往往并非故意，也无旨趣的创作上，再用它的凿子加以最后的琢磨，使笨重的东西苏生过来，给它一些轻妙和灵动，洗净那粗浅的整齐和相称，更除去恶劣的缺点和错误，将赤条条的主旨，赫然显在目前，对于生在精练的洁白和苦痛的严寒之中的一切，灌入神奇的温暖去的时候，这才能够达成。

车子又转了几个弯，他终于停在房屋前面了，现在看起来，这房屋就更显得寒伧。墙壁和门上，满生着青苔。前园里造着样样的屋子：堆房，仓屋，下房等，彼此挤得很紧——而且无不分明的带着陈旧倒败的情形；左右各有一道门，通到别的园子里。所有一切，都在证明这里先前是曾有很大的家业的，但现在却统统见得落寞凄凉了。能给这悲哀景象一点快活的东西，什么也没有：没有开放的门户，没有往来的人，没有活泼的家景！只有园门却开着，因为有一个人拉了一辆盖着席子的重载的大车，要进前园去；好像意在使这荒芜寂灭的地方有一点活气：别的时候，却连这门也锁得紧紧的，铁闩上就挂着一把坚强的大锁。在一间屋子前面，乞乞科夫立刻发见了一个人样子，正在和车夫吵嘴。许多工夫，他还决不定这人的是男是女来。看看穿着的衣服，简直不能了然，也很像一件女人的家常衫子；头上戴一顶帽子，却正如村妇所常戴的。“确是一个女人！”他想，然而立刻接下去道：“不，并不是的！”——“自然是一个女人！”他熟视了一番之后，终于说。那边也一样的十分留心的在观察。好像这来人是一种世界奇迹似的，因为不但看他，连对绥里方和马匹也在从头到尾的注视。从挂在她带上的一串钥匙和过份的给与农人的痛骂，乞乞科夫便断定了她该是一个女管家。

“请问，妈妈，”他一面跨下车子来，一面说，“主人在做什么呀？”

“没有在家！”那女管家不等他说完话，就说，但又立刻接着道：“您找他什么事？”

“有一件买卖上的事情。”

“那么，请您到里面去。”女管家说，一面去开门，向他转过那沾满面粉的背脊来，还给他看了衫子上的一个大窟窿。

他走进宽阔的昏暗的门，就向他吹来了一股好像从地窖中来的冷气。由这门走到一间昏暗的屋子，只从门下面的阔缝里，透出一点很少的光亮。他开开房门，这才总算看见了明亮的阳光。但四面的凌乱，却使他大吃一吓。好像全家正在洗地板，因此把所有的家具，都搬到这屋子里来了。桌子上面，竟搁着破了的椅子，旁边是一口停摆的钟，蜘蛛已经在这里结了网。也有靠着墙壁的架子，摆着旧银器和种种中国的磁瓶。写字桌原是嵌镶螺钿的，但螺钿处处脱落了，只剩下填着干胶的空洞，乱放着各样斑剥陆离的什物：一堆写过字的纸片，上面压一个卵形把手的已经发绿的大理石的镇纸，一本红边的猪皮书面的旧书，一个不过胡桃大小的挤过汁的干柠檬，一段椅子的破靠手，一个装些红色液体，内浮三个苍蝇，上盖一张信纸的酒杯，一小块封信蜡，一片不知道从那里拾来的破布，两枝鹅毛笔，沾过墨水，却已经干透了，好像生着痨病，一把发黄的牙刷，大约还在法国人攻入莫斯科(1)之前，它的主人曾经刷过牙齿的，诸如此类。

墙壁上是贴近的，乱到毫无意思的挂着许多画：一条狭长的钢版画，是什么地方的战争，在这里看见很大的战鼓，头戴三角帽的呐喊的兵丁和淹死的马匹。这版画装在马霍戈尼树做的框子里，框条上嵌有青铜的细线，四角饰着青铜的蔷薇，只是玻璃没有。旁边挂一幅很大的发黑的油画，占去了半墙壁，上面画些花卉，水果，一个切碎的西瓜，野猪的口鼻，和倒挂的野鸭头。天花板中央挂一个烛台，套着麻布袋，灰尘蒙得很厚，至于仿佛是蚕茧。屋子的一角上，躺着一堆旧东西：这都是粗货，不配放在桌上的。但究竟是些什么东西呢——却很不容易辨别，因为那上面积着极厚的尘埃，只要谁出手去一碰，就会很像戴上一只手套。从这垃圾堆中，极分明的显露出来的惟一的物件，是：一个破掉的木铲，一块旧的鞋后跟。如果没有桌上的一顶破旧的睡帽在那里作证，是谁也不相信这房子里住着活人的。当我们的主角还在潜心研究这奇特的屋中陈设的时候，边门一开，那女管家，那他在前园里遇见过的，就走了进来了。但这回他觉得，将这人看作女管家，倒还是看作男管家合适：因为一个女管家，至少是大抵不刮胡子的，然而这汉子刮胡子，而且真也稀奇得很，他的下巴和脸的下半部，就像人们往往在马房里刷马的铁丝刷。乞乞科夫的脸上显出要问的表情来；他焦急的等着这男管家来说什么话。但那人也在等候着乞乞科夫的开口。到底，苦于这两面的窘急的乞乞科夫，就决计发问了：

“哪，主人在做什么呀？他在家么？”

“主人在这里！”男管家回答说。

“那么，在那里呢？”乞乞科夫回问道。

“您是瞎的吗，先生？怎的？”男管家说。“先生！我就是这家的主人！”

这时我们的主角就不自觉的倒退了一点，向着这人凝视。自有生以来，他遇见过各色各样的人，自然，敬爱的读者，连我们没有见过的也在内，但一向并未会到过一个这样的人物。从他的脸上，看不出一点特色来。和普通的瘦削的老头子，是不大有什么两样的；不过下巴凸出些，并且常常掩着手帕，免得被唾沫所沾湿。那小小的眼睛还没有呆滞，在浓眉底下转来转去，恰如两匹小鼠子，把它的尖嘴钻出暗洞来，立起耳朵，动着胡须，看看是否藏着猫儿或者顽皮孩子，猜疑的嗅着空气。那衣服可更加有意思。要知道他的睡衣究竟是什么底子，只好白费力；袖子和领头都非常龌龊，发着光，好像做长靴的郁赫皮；背后并非拖着两片的衣裾，倒是有四片，上面还露着一些棉花团。颈子上也围着一种莫名其妙的东西，是旧袜子，是腰带，还是绷带呢，不能断定。但决不是围巾。一句话，如果在那里的教堂前面，乞乞科夫遇见了这么模样的他，他一定会布施他两戈贝克；因为，为我们的主角的名誉起见，应该提一提，他有一个富于同情的心，遇见穷人，是没有一回能不给两戈贝克的。但对他站着的人，却不是乞丐，而是上流的地主，而且这地主还蓄有一千以上的魂灵，要寻出第二个在他的仓库里有这么多的麦子，麦粉和农产物，在堆房，燥屋和栈房里也充塞着呢绒和麻布，生熟羊皮，干鱼以及各种菜蔬和果子的人来，就不大容易，只要看一眼他那堆着没有动用的各种木材和一切家具的院子就是——人就会以为自己是进了莫斯科的木器市场里，那些勤俭的丈母和姑母之流，由家里的厨娘带领着，在买她的东西之处的。他这里，照眼的是雕刻的，车光的，拼成的，编出的木器的山：桶子，盆子，柏油桶，有嘴和无嘴的提桶，浴盆，匣子，女人们用它来理亚麻和别的东西的梳麻板，细柳枝编成的小箱子，白桦皮拼成的小匣子，还有无论贫富，俄国人都要使用的别的什物许许多。人也许想，泼留希金要这无数的各种东西做什么用呢？就是田地再大两倍，时候再过几代，也是使用不完的。然而他却实在还没有够，每天每天，他很不满足的在自己的庄子的路上走，看着桥下，跳板下，凡有在路上看见的：一块旧鞋底，一片破衣裳，一个铁钉，一角碎瓦——他都拾了去，抛在那乞乞科夫在屋角上所看见的堆子里。“我们的渔翁又在那里捞鱼了。”一看见他在四下里寻东西，农人们常常说。而且的确经他走过之后，道路就用不着打扫；一个过路的兵官落掉了他的一个马刺——刚刚觉得，这却已经躺在那堆子里面了；一个女人一疏忽，把水桶忘记在井边——他也飞快的提了这水桶去。如果有农人当场捉住了他，他就不说什么，和气的放下那偷得的物件；然而一躺在堆子里，可就什么都完结了：他起誓，呼上帝作证，说这东西原是他怎样怎样，如何如何买得，或者简直还是他的祖父传授下来的。就是在自己的家里，他也拾起地上的一切东西来：一小段封信蜡，一张纸片，一枝鹅毛笔，都放在写字桌，或者窗台上。

然而他也曾经有过是一个勤俭的一家之主的时候的！他也曾为体面的夫，体面的父，他的邻人来访问他，到他这里午餐，学习些聪明的节省和持家的方法。那时的生活还都很活泼，很整齐：水磨和碌碡快活的转动着，呢绒厂，旋盘厂，机织厂，都在不倦地作工；主人的锋利的眼睛，看到广大的领地的角角落落，操劳得像一个勤快的蜘蛛，从这一角到那一角，都结上家政的网。在他的脸上，自然也一向没有显过剧烈的热意和感情，但他的眼闪着明白的决断。他的话说出经验和智识，客人们都愿意来听他；和蔼而能谈的主妇，在她的相识的人们中也有好名望；两个可爱的女儿常来招呼那宾客，都是金色发，鲜活如初开的蔷薇。儿子是活泼的，壮健的少年，跳出来迎接客人，不大问对手愿不愿，就和客人接吻。全家里的窗户是统统开着的。中层楼上住着一个家庭教师，法国人，脸总刮得极光，又是放枪的好手：他每天总打一两只雉鸡或是野鸭来帮午膳，但间或只有麻雀蛋，这时他就叫煎一个蛋饼自己吃，因为除他之外，合家是谁也不吃的。这楼上，还住着一个强壮的村妇，是两位女儿的教师。主人自己，也总是同桌来吃饭，身穿一件黑色的燕尾服，旧是确有些旧的，但很干净，整齐，肘弯并没有破，也还并没有补。然而这好主妇亡故了，钥匙的一部份和琐屑的烦虑，从此落在他身上。泼留希金就像一切鳏夫一样，急躁，吝啬，猜疑了起来。他不放心他的大女儿亚历山特拉·斯台班诺夫娜了，但他并不错，因为她不久就和一个不知什么骑兵联队里的骑兵二等大尉跑掉，她知道父亲有一种奇怪的成见，以为军官都是赌客和挥霍者，所以不喜欢的，便赶紧在一个乡下教堂里和他结了婚。那父亲只送给他们诅咒，却并没有想去寻觅，追回。家里就更加空虚，破落了。家主的吝啬，也日见其分明；在他头上发亮的最初的白发，更帮助着吝啬的增加，因为白发正是贪婪的忠实同伴。法国的家庭教师被辞退了，因为儿子到了该去服务的时候；那位女士也被驱逐了，因为亚历山特拉·斯台班诺夫娜的逃走，她也非全不相干。那儿子，父亲是要他切切实实的学做文官——这是父亲告诉了他的——送到省会里去的，他却进了联队，还寄一封信给父亲——这是做了兵官之后了——来讨钱给他做衣服；但他由此得到的物事，自然不过是所谓碰了一鼻子灰。终于是，连和泼留希金住在一起的小女儿也死掉了，只有这老头子孤另另的剩在这世界上，算是他的一切财产的保护者，看守者，以及惟一的所有者。孤独的生活，又给贪婪新添了许多油，大家知道，吝啬是真的狼贪，越吃，就越不够。人类的情感，在他这里原也没有深根的，于是更日见其浅薄，微弱，而且还要天天从这废墟似的身上再碎落一小块。有些时候，他根据着自己对于军官的偏见，觉得他的儿子将要输光了财产；泼留希金便送给他一些清清楚楚的父亲的诅咒，想从此不再相关，而且连他的死活也毫不注意了。每年总要关上或者钉起一个窗户来，直到终于只剩了两个，而其中之一，读者也已经知道，还要贴上了纸张；每年总从他眼睛里失去一大片重要的家计，他那狭窄的眼光，便越是只向着那些在他房里，从地板上拾了起来的纸片和鹅毛笔；对于跑来想从他的农产物里买些什么的买主，他更难商量，更加固执了；他们来和他磋商，论价，到底也只好放手，明白了他乃是一个鬼，不是人；他的干草和谷子腐烂了，粮堆和草堆都变成真正的肥堆，只差还没有人在这上面种白菜；地窖里的面粉硬得像石头一样，只好用斧头去劈下来；麻布，呢绒，以及手织的布匹，如果要它不化成飞灰，便千万不要去碰一下。泼留希金已经不大明白自己有些什么了，他所记得的，只有：架子上有一样好东西——瓶子里装着甜酒，他曾做一个记号在上面，给谁也不能偷喝它——以及一段封信蜡或一枝鹅毛笔的所在。但征收却还照先前一样。农奴须纳照旧的地租，女人须缴旧额的胡桃，女织匠还是要照机数织出一定的布匹，来付给她的主人。这些便都收进仓库去，在那里面霉烂，变灰，而且连他自己也竟变成人的灰堆了。亚历山特拉·斯台班诺夫娜带着她的小儿子，回来看了他两回，希望从他这里弄点什么去；她和骑兵二等大尉的放浪生活，分明也并没有结婚前所豫想那样的快活。泼留希金宽恕了她，还至于取了一个躺在桌上的扣子，送给小外孙做玩具，然而不肯给一点钱。别一回是亚历山特拉·斯台班诺夫娜和两个儿子同来的，还带给他一个奶油面包做茶点，并一件崭新的睡衣，因为父亲穿着这样的睡衣，看起来不但难受，倒简直是羞惭。泼留希金很爱抚那两个外孙儿，给分坐在自己的左右两腿上，低昂起来，使他们好像在骑马；奶油面包和睡衣，他感激的收下了，对于女儿，却没有一点回送的物事，亚历山特拉·斯台班诺夫娜就只好这么空空的回家。

现在站在乞乞科夫面前的，就是这样的人！但还应该补正，这一种样式，在爱扩张和发展，更胜于退守和集中的俄国，是不常遇见的，更可诧异的情景，倒是随时随地可以遇见一个地主，靠着特出的门第来享乐他的生活，为了阔绰的大排场，将他的财产化到一文不剩，由此显出俄国式。一个还未多见世面的旅客，一看到这样的府邸，是就要站住，并且问着自己的：如此华贵的王侯，怎么会跑到这渺小卑微的农民中间来呢：像宫殿一样，屹立着他的白石的房屋，和无数的烟通，望台和占风，为一大群侧屋以及造给宾客的住房所围绕。这里还缺什么呢！有演剧，有跳舞，有假面会，辉煌的花园，整夜妖艳的陈在斑斓的灯光下，响亮的音乐充满了空间。半省的人们，都盛装着在树下愉快的散步，在这硬造的光彩里，谁也没有留意，没有觉得粗野吓人的不调和，这时候，有一条小枝，映着人造的光，做戏似的突然从树丛中伸出；那失了叶的光泽的臂膊，愈高愈严正，愈昏暗，愈可怕，高举在夜的天空中，萧瑟的树梢，深深的避进永久的黑暗里，像在抱怨那照着它根上的光辉。

泼留希金默默的站着，已经好几分钟了；乞乞科夫也不想先开口，看了他的主人和奇特的周围的情景，他失去豫定的把握了。他想对他这样说：因为他听到过泼留希金的道德和特出的品格，所以前来表示敬意，是自己的义务；然而又以为这未免太离奇。他又偷偷的一瞥屋子里的东西，觉得“道德”和“特出的品格”这两个字，是可以用“节俭”和“整顿”来代换的；于是照这意思，改好了他的话：因为听到过泼留希金治家的节俭和非凡的管理，所以他觉得有趋前奉访，将他的敬仰的表示，陈在足下的义务。自然，先前已经说过，也还有别样更好的理由的，但他不想说，这很不漂亮。

泼留希金低声的说了些话，仅仅动着嘴唇——因为他已经没有牙齿了；——他究竟说了些什么呢，听不分明，但他的话里大约是这样的意思：“你还是带了你的敬仰到魔鬼那里去罢！”然而我们这里，是有对客的义务和道德的，就是吝啬鬼，也不能随便跨过这规则，于是他接着说得清楚一点道：“请请，您请坐呀！”

“我的没有招待客人，已经很长久了，”他说，“老实说起来，这是没有什么好处的。人们学着最没用，最没意思的时髦，彼此拜访，——家里的事情倒什么也不管……况且马匹还总得喂草呀！我早已吃过中饭了，家里的厨房又小，又脏，烟囱也坏着：我简直不敢在灶里生火，怕惹出火灾来。”

“竟是这样的么？”乞乞科夫想。“幸而我在梭巴开维支那里吃过一点干酪饼和一口羊腿来了！”

“您只要想一想就是，这多么不容易！如果我要家里有一把干草的话！”泼留希金接下去道。“真的，从那里来呢？我只有一点点田地，农奴又懒，不喜欢做工，总只记挂着小酒店……人是应该小心些，不要到得他的老年，却还去讨饭的！”

“但人家告诉我，”到这里，乞乞科夫谦和的回口道，“您有着上千的魂灵哩！”

“谁告诉您的？您该在这家伙的脸上唾一口的，他造这样的谣言，先生！那一定是一个促狭鬼，在和您开玩笑呀。人们总是说，一千个魂灵，但如果算一算，剩下的就不多！这三年来，为了那该死的热病，我的农奴整批整批的死掉了。”

“真的？真有这么多吗？”乞乞科夫同情的大声说。

“唔，是的，很多！”

“我可以问，那有多少吗？”

“要有八十个！”

“的确？”

“我不说谎，先生！”

“我还可以问一下吗？这数目，可是上一次人口调查之后的总数呢？”

“要是这样，就还算好的了！”泼留希金说。“照您说的一算，可还要多：至少要有一百二十个魂灵！”

“真的？竟有一百二十个？”乞乞科夫叫了起来，因为吃惊，张开了嘴巴。

“要说谎，我的年纪可是太大了，先生：我已经上了六十哩！”泼留希金说，好像他因为乞乞科夫的近乎高兴的叫喊，觉得不快活。乞乞科夫也悟到了用一副这样的冷淡和无情来对别人的苦恼，实在是不大漂亮的，就赶紧长叹一声，并且表示了他的悼惜。

“可惜您的悼惜，对我并没有用处！我不能把这藏进钱袋里去呀！”泼留希金说。“您瞧，近地住着一个大尉，鬼知道他是怎么掉进这里来的。因为是我的一个亲戚，就时常来伯伯长，伯伯短的，在我的手上接吻；如果他一表示他的同情，就发出一种实在是吼声，叫人要塞住耳朵才好。这人有一张通红的脸，顶喜欢烧酒瓶。他的钱大约都在军营里化光，或者给一个什么坤伶从衣袋里捞完了。他为什么这样的会表同情呢，恐怕就为了这缘故罢！”

乞乞科夫竭力向他声明，自己的同情和那大尉的，完全不是同类，再转到他并非只用言语，还要用实行来表示；于是毫不迟延，直截的表明了他的用意，说自己情愿来尽这重大的义务，负担一切死于这样不幸的灾难的农奴的人头税。这提议，显然是出于泼留希金的意料之外了。他瞪着眼睛，看定了对手，许多工夫没有动。到底却道：“您恐怕是在军营里的罢？”

“不是，”乞乞科夫狡猾的躲闪着，回答说，“我其实不过是做文职的。”

“做文职的！”泼留希金复述了一句，于是咬着嘴唇，仿佛他的嘴里含着食物一样。“唔，这又为什么呢？这不是单使您自己吃亏吗？”

“只要您乐意，我就来吃这亏。”

“唉唉，先生！唉唉，您这我的恩人！”泼留希金喊了起来，因为高兴，就不再觉得有一块鼻烟，像浓咖啡的底脚一样，从他鼻孔里涌出，实在不能入画，而且他睡衣的豁开的下半截，将衬裤给人看见，也不是有味的景象了。“您对一个苦老头子做着好事哩！唉唉，你这我的上帝，你这我的救主！”泼留希金再也说不出别的话来了。然而不过一瞬间，那高兴，恰如在呆板的脸上突然出现一样，也突然的消失，并不剩一丝痕迹，他的脸又变成照旧的懊丧模样了。他是在用手巾拭脸的，就捏作一团，来擦上嘴唇。

“您真的要——请您不要见怪——说明一下，每年来付这税吗？收钱的该是我，还是皇家呢？”

“您看怎么样？我们要做得简便：我们彼此立一个买卖合同，像他们还是活着的似的，您把他们卖给了我。”

“是的，一个买卖合同……”泼留希金说着，有些迟疑，又咬起嘴唇来了。“您说，一个买卖合同——这就又要化钱了！法院里的官儿是很不要脸的！先前只要半卢布的铜钱加上一袋面粉就够，现在却得满满的一车压碎麦子，还要红钞票(2)做添头。他们现在就是这样的要钱。我真不懂，为什么竟没有人发表出来的。至少，也得给他们一点道德的教训。用一句良言，到底是谁都会被收服的。无论怎么说，决没有人反对道德的教训的呀！”

“哪，哪，你就是反对的哩。”乞乞科夫想；但他立刻大声的接着说，因为对于他的尊敬，连买卖合同的费用，也全归自己负担。

泼留希金一听到他的客人连买卖合同的费用也想自己付，就断定他是一个十足的呆子，不过装作文官模样，其实是在什么军营里做事，和坤伶们鬼混的。但无论如何，他总掩不住自己的高兴，将各种祝福出格的送给这客人，对于他自己和他的孩子，虽然并没有问过他孩子的有无。于是他走到窗口，用手指敲着玻璃，叫道：“喂！泼罗式加！”立刻听到好像有人拼命的跑进大门来，四处响动了一阵，就有长靴的橐橐声。终于是房门一开，泼罗式加走进来了，是一个十二三岁的孩子。他穿着几乎每步都要脱出的很大的雨靴。究竟泼罗式加为什么要穿这么大的长靴呢，读者是就会明白的。泼留希金给他所有的仆役穿的，就只有一双长靴，总是放在前厅里。有谁受主人的屋子里叫唤，就得先在全个前园里跳舞一番，到得大门，穿上长靴，以这体裁走进屋子去。一走出屋子，又须在大门口脱下他的长靴，踮起脚后跟走回原路去。假使有人在秋天，尤其是在早晨，如果初霜已降，从窗子里向外一望，他就能欣赏这美景，看泼留希金家的仆役演着怎样出色的跳舞的。

“您看这嘴脸，先生。”泼留希金指着泼罗式加，向乞乞科夫说。“这家伙笨得像一段木头。但是您只要放下一点什么罢，吓，他已经捞去了。喂，你来干什么的，你这驴子？唔，有什么事？”这时他停了一停，泼罗式加也一声不响。“烧茶炊呀！听见吗？钥匙在这里！送给玛孚拉去，再对她说，叫她到食物库里去。那里的架子上还有一个复活节的饼干，是亚历山特拉·斯台班诺夫娜送给我的；就拿这来喝茶……等着，你要到那里去了，昏蛋？这胡涂虫！你脚跟上有鬼的么。先要听我的话！那饼干的上面是不大新鲜了的。她得用小刀稍微刮一下；但那末屑不要给我抛掉！得留给鸡吃的。也不许你同到食物库里去，要不，就给你吃桦树棍，知道吗，那味道！你现在就有好胃口呢。我们就好好的多添些。给我到食物库里去试试看！我在窗口看着你的鬼花样。这些东西是不能相信的。”当泼罗式加拖着他的七里靴，已经从门口不见了的时候，他转过来对着乞乞科夫，接着说。于是向他射了一道猜疑的眼光。这样的未曾听到过的豪爽和大度，使他觉得难恃和可疑了，他自己想：“鬼知道呢，恐怕像所有的游手一样，也不过是一个吹牛皮的！先撒一通谎，好谈些闲天和喝几杯茶，之后呢，是走他的路！”一半为了小心，一半要探一探这客人，他就说，赶快写好买卖合同，倒不坏，因为人是一种极不稳当，非常脆弱的东西：今朝不知明朝事。

乞乞科夫声明，契约是照他的希望，立刻可以写的，只还要一张所有农奴的名单。

这使泼留希金放了心。他好像决定了一个计画，而且真的掏出钥匙串子来，走近柜子去，开开了它，在瓶子和碟子之间找寻了好久，终于叫了起来道：“现在找不到了；我还有一瓶很好的果子酒在这里的；如果那一伙没有喝掉的话！那些东西实在是强盗。哦，在这里了！”乞乞科夫看见他两手捧着一个小瓶，满是灰尘，好像穿了一件小衫。“这还是我的亡妻做的呢，”泼留希金接着说，“那女管家，那坏东西，就把它放在这里，再也不管，总不肯塞起来，那坏货！上帝知道，多少蛆虫和苍蝇和别的灰尘都掉进去了，但我已经统统捞出，现在可又很干净了，我想敬您一杯子。”

然而乞乞科夫却热烈的拒绝了这心愿，并且声明，他早已吃过，喝过了。

“早已吃过，喝过了！”泼留希金说。“自然，自然，上流社会的人，是一看就知道的；他不饿，总是吃得饱饱的，但是闲荡流氓呢，你喂他多少就多少……例如那大尉罢：一到我这里来，立刻说：‘阿伯，您没有什么吃的吗？’我那里还像他的伯父呀，他倒是我的祖父哩。在自己的家里他也实在没有东西吃，所以只好逛来荡去！您要一张所有那些懒虫的名单吗？自然，那不错！这很容易，我早写在另外的一张纸上了，原想待到这回的人口调查的时候，就把他们取消的。”泼留希金戴起眼镜来，开手去翻搅他的那些纸。他解开许多纸包的绳，又把它们抛来抛去，弄得灰尘飞进客人的鼻孔中，使他要打嚏。他终于抽出一张两面写着字的纸片来。满是农奴的姓名，密得好像苍蝇矢，那上面各式各样都有，其中有派拉摩诺夫和批美诺夫，有班台来摩诺夫，而且简直还有一个格力戈黎绰号叫作“老是走不到”。一共大约有一百二十人。乞乞科夫一看见这总数，微笑了。他把纸片藏在衣袋里，还对泼留希金说，他应该到市上去，把这件买卖办妥。

“到市上去？我怎么能……？我不能不管我的房子呀！我的当差的都是贼骨头，坏家伙；有一天，竟偷得我连挂挂我的外套的钉子也没有了。”

“您在那里总该有一个熟人罢？”

“谁是呢？我的熟人都已经死掉，或者早不和我来往了。唉唉，有的，先生！怎么会没有！我自然有一个的！”他突然叫了起来。“那审判厅长，他是我的好朋友！他先前常常来看我的；我怎么会不认识他呢！他是我的年青时候的朋友。我们常常一同去爬篱垣的！没有熟人？我告诉您，这就是熟人！……我可以写信给他吗？”

“那当然。”

“是很要好的熟人，是老同窗呀！”

呆板的脸上，忽然闪过一种好像温暖的光，一种人情的稀薄的发露，或者至少是一点影子，使那死相有了活气，恰如坠水的人，在忽然间，而且在不意中，竟在水面上出现，使聚在岸上的人们都高兴的欢呼起来；然而怀着欣幸的姊妹和兄弟们投下施救的绳，焦急的等着他一只肩膀，或是一只痉挛得无力了的臂膀再露到水上来，却不过一个泡影——那浮出，已经是最末的一次了。周围全都沉默，平静的水面，这时就显得更加可怕和空虚。泼留希金的脸也就是这样的，感情的微光在这上面一闪之后，几乎越发冰冷，庸俗，而且没有表情了。

“桌上原有一张白纸的呀，”他说，“可是我不知道，这弄到那里去了：那些不要好的底下人！”——他望过桌子的上面和下面，到处乱翻了一通，终于喊起来道：“玛孚拉，喂！玛孚拉！”在他的叫唤声中，一个女人出现了，手里拿一个碟子，俨然坐在那里面的，就是读者已经熟识的那饼干。这时候，他们俩就开始了这样的对话：

“你把纸弄到那里去了，你这女贼？”

“天在头上，老爷！我没有看见什么纸呀，除了您盖着酒杯的那一片。”

“看你的眼睛就知道，你捞了去了。”

“我捞它做什么呢？我不知道拿它来做什么用。我不会看书，也不会写字！”

“胡说白道，你搬到教堂的道人那里去了，他是会划几笔的，你就给了他了。”

“如果他要纸，什么时候都会自己去买的。他就从没有见过您的纸！”

“等着就是，看到末日裁判的时候，魔鬼用了他们的铁枷来着着实实的惩治你。要知道你会吃怎样的苦头！”

“我怕什么呢，如果我没有拿过那张纸。您可以责备我别样的做女人的错处，但我会偷东西，却还没有人说过哩。”

“哼，看魔鬼来怎样的惩治你罢！他们说，就因为你骗了你的主人，还用了他们的烧得通红的钳，把你夹住！”

“那么我就回答说：我是没有罪的，上帝知道，我是没有罪的……但这纸就在桌子上呀。您总是闹些无用的唠唠叨叨！”

泼留希金果然看见纸片就在桌子上，就停了一下，咬着自己的嘴唇，于是说道：“唔，为什么你就这么嚷嚷的？这样的一个执拗货。人说你一句，你就立刻回一打。去罢，给我拿个火来，我可以封信。且慢！你大约还要带了油脂烛来的；油脂很容易化，走掉了，那就白费！你倒不如给我拿些点火的松香火柴来罢。”

玛孚拉出去了，泼留希金却坐在靠椅上，拿起笔来，把那纸片还在手指之间翻来复去的转了好一会；他在研究，是否还可以从这里裁下一点来；然而终于知道做不到了；他这才把笔浸到墨水瓶里去，那里面装着一种起了白花的液体，浮着许多苍蝇，于是写了起来；他把字母连得很密，极像曲谱的音符，还得制住那在纸上随便挥洒开去的笔势。他小心的一行一行写下去，一面后悔着每行之间，总还是剩出一点空白来。

—个人，能够堕落到这样的无聊，猥琐，卑微里去的吗？他会变化得这么利害的吗？这还是真实的模样吗？——是的！——这全是并非不真实的。人们确可以变成这一切！向一个现在热烈如火的青年，倘给他看一看他自己的老年的小照，恐怕他会吃惊得往后跳的。唉唉，要小心谨慎地管好你们的生活的路，如果已经从你们那柔和娇嫩的青年，跨到严正固定的成人时代去——唉唉，要小心谨慎地管好各种人类的感动，它会不知不觉的在中途消亡，失掉：你们再找不到它！可怕而残酷的是在远地里吓人的老年，它什么也不归还，什么也不交付。坟墓倒是比它还慈悲的；墓碑上也许写着文字道：“有人葬此。”但在老人的冰冷的，没有表情的脸上，却看不出一点文字记号来。

“您没有一个朋友，”泼留希金折着信纸，一面说，“用得着逃掉的农奴的吗？”

“您也有逃掉的？”乞乞科夫连忙问，像从梦中醒来一样。

“那自然，我有。我的女婿已经去找寻过了，他说，连他们的踪影也看不见；不过他是一个兵，只会响响马刺的，如果要他在法律的事情上出力，那就……”

“但是究竟有多少呢？”

“该有七十个罢，至少。”

“真的？”

“上帝知道！没有一年会不逃走一两个的。现在的人，都吃不饱了，整天不做事，只想吃东西，我可是连自己也没得吃……真的，我情愿把他们几乎白送。不是吗，您告诉您的朋友去：只要找回一打来，他就会弄到一笔出息的，一个出色的魂灵，要值到五百卢布。”

“连气息也给朋友嗅到不得！”乞乞科夫想，他并且说明，可惜他并没有这样的朋友，况且单是办理这件事，就得化许多钱；请教法律，倒不如保保自己，因为那是连自己的衣服也会送掉半截的。然而如果泼留希金真觉得境遇很为难，那么他，乞乞科夫，他为了同情心，可以付他一点小款子……但是这，已经说过，真是有限得很，不值得说的。

“但您想给多少呢？”泼留希金问。他简直变了犹太人，两只手像白杨树叶似的发抖了。

“每一个我给二十五戈贝克。”

“您现付吗？”

“是的，您可以马上收到钱。”

“听哪，先生，我有多么穷苦，您是知道的，您还是给我四十戈贝克罢。”

“最可佩服的先生，不但四十戈贝克，我还肯给您五百卢布哩！非常情愿，因为我看见一位最可敬，最高尚的人，却为了他的正直，正在吃苦呀。”

“是的，可不是吗！上帝知道的！”泼留希金垂了头，使劲的摇起来，说。“就是因为正直呵。”

“您瞧，您的品格，我立刻就明白了。我为什么不给五百卢布一个呢？不过我也是并不富裕的；再加五戈贝克倒不要紧，那就是每个魂灵卖到三十戈贝克了。”

“您再添上两戈贝克罢，先生。”

“那就是了，可以的，再添两戈贝克！魂灵有多少呢，您不是说七十个吗？”

“不，一总七十八个。”

“七十八，七十八乘三十二戈贝克，那就得……”这时我们的主角想了一秒钟，并没有更长久，便说道：“那就得二十四卢布九十六戈贝克！”对于算学，他是很能干的。于是使泼留希金写一张收条，付给他款子，他用两只手抓住，极担心的搬到写字桌前去，仿佛手里捧着一种液体，每一瞬间都在怕它流出一样，到得站在桌子的前面，也还要仔仔细细的看一通钞票，然后仍然很小心的放在一个抽屉里，大约钱是埋在这地方的了，一直到村子里的两个牧师，凯普长老和波黎凯普长老，来埋葬了他自己：给他的女儿和女婿一个难以言语形容的高兴——也许还有大尉，那要和他扳亲戚的。泼留希金藏好了钱之后，就坐在靠椅上，好像再也找不出什么新的谈话资料来了。

“怎么，您要走了吗？”当他看见乞乞科夫微微一动，想从衣袋里去取手巾的时候，就说。这一问，使乞乞科夫悟到久在这里实在没有意思了。“对啦，这是时候了！”他说着，就去取帽子。

“您不喝茶？”

“不，多谢您！还是别的时候再喝罢。”

“哦，为什么呢？我已经叫生茶炊去了！但老实说，我是也不喜欢茶的：这是一种很贵的物事，而且糖价钱也尽在涨起来。泼罗式加！我们不要茶炊了。把那饼干交给玛孚拉去！听见吗？她得放回原地方；不不，还是放在这里罢，我自己会送去的。再见，先生；上帝保佑您！那封信请您交给审判厅长罢，是不是？他该会看的！他是我的一个老朋友。哦哦，从小就在一起玩的朋友呀。”

于是这奇特的形相，这打皱的老人领他到了前园，乞乞科夫一走，泼留希金即刻叫把园门锁上了。接着是走到所有堆房和食物库去，查考那些看守夫是否都在他们的岗位上，他们是站在屋角用木勺敲着空桶，以代马口铁鼓的；他也到厨房里去瞥了一眼，看看可曾给仆役们备妥了合式的，可口的食物，然而这不过是一句话，其实倒是自己喝了粥和白菜汤。其次是他终于把大家训一通他们的做坏事，骂一顿他们的偷东西，然后回到自己的屋子里。待到他只有自己一个时，却忽然起了一种心思，要对于客人报答一下他那无比的义侠了：“我要当作礼物，把表去送给他，”他想——“还是一只漂亮的银表，并不是黄铜或白铜做的，自然破了一点，但他可以去修；他还是一个年青人，倘要引新娘子看得上眼，是得有一只表的。但是，且慢！”他再想过一会之后，接下去道，“还不如写在遗嘱里罢，等我死后，他才得到表，那么，他到后来也还记得我了。”

然而我们的主角却即使没有表，也还是极顶愉快满足的心情。这样的出乎意外的收获，才是真正的上天之赐。这实在是毫无抗议之处的：不但是几十个死魂灵，还加上几打逃走的，一共竟有二百枚！当他临近泼留希金的村庄时，自然已经有一种豫感，觉得这地方可以赚一点东西，但这样的好买卖，他却没有计算到。一路上他都出奇的快活，吹口笛，唱歌，还把拳头靠着嘴巴，吹了起来，像是吹喇叭。后来他竟出声的唱着曲子了，很特别，很稀奇，连绥里方也诧异的侧着耳朵听，摇摇头，说道：“瞧罢，我的老爷多么会唱呵！”

当他们驶近市街的时候，天已经全黑了。光和暗完全交错起来，连一切物事也好像融成一片。画有条纹的市门，显着很不定，很不分明的颜色；市上的警兵，仿佛那胡子生得比眉毛还要高，他的鼻子却简直不大见有了。车轮的响声，车身的震动，报告着已经又到了铺石的街路上，街灯还没有点，只从几处人家的窗户里，闪出一些光，在街角和横街里闹着照例的场面；人们听着密谈和私语，这是小市的晚间常常要有的，这地方，有许多兵丁，车夫，工人和特别的人物，是闺秀的一种，肩披红围巾，没有袜，在十字街头穿来穿去，像蝙蝠一般。然而乞乞科夫并不留心她们，一样的也不留心那拿着手杖，大概是从市外散步回来的瘦长的官吏。时时有些叫喊冲到他的耳朵里，好像是女人的声音：“胡说，你喝醉了；我不许你这么随便！”或者是“又想吵架，你这野人，同到警察署去罢，那我就教你知道。”一言以蔽之，这些话的功效，就像对于一个从戏院回来，头里印着西班牙的街道，昏黄的月夜，挟琴的美人的富于幻想的二十左右的青年，给洗一个蒸汽浴。极神奇的梦，极古怪的幻想，是纵横交织的在他的脑子里回旋的。他觉得会飞上七重天，也会马上到诗人希勒尔(3)那里去做客——现在这晦气的话，像霹雳一样，突然落在他的身边，他觉得自己又回到地上来了，唔，而且竟还在一家小酒店附近的“干草市场”上，于是苍老荒凉的忙日月，就从新把他吞去了。

篷车再猛烈的一震，像进地洞似的，终于钻进了大门。乞乞科夫由彼得尔希加来迎接，他一只手捏住了衣裾——因为他是不喜欢衣裾分散开来的——用别一只手帮他的主人下了车子。伙计也跑出来了，拿着一枝烛，抹布搭在肩膀上，对于他主人的回来，彼得尔希加是否很高兴呢，这可很难说，但当他向着绥里方大有意义似的着眼睛的时候，在他那平时非常严正的脸上，却好像开朗了一点也似的。

“您可是真也旅行得长久了。”伙计在前面给他照着扶梯，说。

“是呀，”乞乞科夫说着，走上扶梯去，“你们怎么样呢？”

“托福！”伙计鞠一个躬，回答道。“昨天来了一位兵官。他住在十六号。”

“中尉吗？”

“我不知道。他是从略山来的，有匹栗壳色马。”

“很好，很好！但愿你以后也很好！”乞乞科夫说着，跨进房里去。当他走过前房的时候，就耸着鼻子，向彼得尔希加道：“窗户是你也可以开它一开的。”

“我是开了的。”彼得尔希加回答说；但是他说谎。他的主人也知道这是一句谎话。然而他不想反驳了。在长途旅行之后，他所有的骨节都很疲乏。他吃了一点很轻淡的晚膳，不过一片乳猪，就赶紧脱了衣服，钻进被窝里，立刻睡得很熟，很熟了，这是一种神奇的睡眠，只有不想到痔疮，不想到跳蚤，也不想到精神兴奋的幸运儿才知道。

第七章


旅人的幸福，是在和那些寒冷，泥泞，尘埃，渴睡的站长，铃铛声，修马车，吵架，马夫，铁匠，以及这一类的伴当，经过了远路的，无聊的旅行之后，却终于望见了总在闪着明灯的挚爱的屋顶——他眼前已经浮出那有着熟识的房子的可爱的老家来，已经听到出迎的家眷的欢呼，孩子们的高兴和吵闹，之后是幽婉的言谈，时时被热烈的爱抚所间断，这就令人振起精神，将一切过去的辛苦从记忆中一扫而光了。幸福的是有着这样一个老家的一家之主；但苦痛的是鳏夫！作家的幸福，是在慌忙避开那无聊的，惹厌的，以可怕的弱点惊人的实在的人物，却去创出具有高洁之德的性格来，从变化无穷的情状的大旋风中，只选取一点例外，他的七弦琴的神妙的声调，也决不变更一回，也不从自己的高处下降，到他那不幸的，无力的弟兄们这里来，也不触及尘世，却只钻在高超的形象的出世的合唱里。他的出色的运道，是加倍的值得羡慕的，他沉浸于这些之间，如在家眷的挚爱的圈子中；而各到各处，也远远的响遍了他的名望。他用檀香的烟云来蒙蔽人们的眼目，用妖媚的文字来驯伏他们的精神，隐瞒了人生的真实，却只将美丽的人物给他们看。大家都拍着手追随他的踪迹，欢呼着围住他的戎车。人们称他为伟大的世界的诗人。翱翔于世间一切别的天才们之上的太空中，恰如大鹫的凌驾一切高飞的禽鸟一样。他的姓名已足震动青年的热烈的心，同情的泪在各人的眼睛里发闪……在力量上，没有人能够和他比并——他是一个神明！但和这相反，敢将随时可见，却被漠视的一切：络住人生的无谓的可怕的污泥，以及布满在艰难的，而且常是荒凉的世路上的严冷灭裂的平凡性格的深处，全都显现出来，用了不倦的雕刀，加以有力的刻划，使它分明地，凸出地放在人们的眼前的作者，那运道可是完全两样了！他得不到民众的高声的喝采，没有感谢在眼泪中闪出，没有被他的文字所感动的精魂的飞扬；没有热情的十六岁的姑娘满怀着英雄的惆怅来迎接他；他不会从自己的箜篌上编出甜美的声音来，令人沉醉；他还逃不脱当时的审判，那伪善的麻木的判决，是将涵养在他自己温暖的胸中的创作，称为猥琐，庸俗，和空虚，置之于侮辱人性的作者们的劣等之列，说他所写的主角正是他自己的性格，从他那里抢去了心和精魂和才能的神火；因为当时的审判，是不知道照见星光的玻璃和可以看清微生物的蠕动的玻璃，同是值得惊奇的，因为当时的审判，是不知道高尚的欢喜的笑，等于高尚的抒情底的感动，和市场小丑的搔痒，是有天渊之别的。当时的审判并不知道这些，对于被侮蔑的诗人，一切就都变了骂詈和谴责：他不同意，不回答，不附和，像一个无家的游子，孤另另的站在空街上。他的事业是艰难的，他觉得他的孤独是苦楚的。

凭着神秘的运命之力，我还要和我的主角携着手，长久的向前走，在全世界，由分明的笑，和谁也不知道的不分明的泪，来历览一切壮大活动的人生。至于崇高的灵感的别一道喷泉，恰如暴风雨一般，从闪烁的，神圣的恐怖中抬起奋迅的头来，使大家失色的倾听着别的叙述的庄严的雷声，却还在较远的时候……

向前走！向前走！去掉你的阴郁的脸相，去掉你的刻在额上的愤激的皱纹。使我们和一切你的无声的喧嚷和铃铛声，再浸在人生里：我们来看看乞乞科夫在做什么罢。

乞乞科夫是刚刚醒来的，他欠伸了一下，觉得睡得很舒畅。他再静静的仰卧了两三分钟，就使他的指头作响，一想到自己快要有了将近四百个魂灵，他的脸便也开朗起来了。他于是跳下眠床来，不照镜子，也不向自己的脸去看一眼，他原是很爱自己的脸的，尤其是下巴，因为他每有机会，总对着他的朋友们称扬，特别是在刮脸的时候。“瞧一下罢，”他常常说，“我有多么出色的圆下巴呀。”于是就用手去摸一摸。但今天，对于下巴，对于脸孔却连一眼也不看了，倒赶紧穿起绣花的摩洛哥皮长靴来。这在妥尔勖克(1)市卖的很多，因为合于我们俄国的嗜好，是一笔大生意。其次是他只穿一件短短的苏格兰样小衫，颇为老练的用脚后跟点着地板，勇敢的跳了两跳。这之后就立刻去做事：他走到箱子前面，恰如廉洁的地方法官在下了判决之后，要去用膳似的，做了一个满足的手势，于是弯向箱子上面去，取出一小包纸片来。他想要毫不拖延，把这事情办妥。于是决计亲自来写注册的呈文，以省付给代书的费用。公文的格式，他是很熟悉的；首先就用笔势飞动的大字，写好一千八百多少年；随后再用小字写下：地主某某，以及别样必要的种种。两个钟头，一切就都功行圆满了。当他接着拿起名单来，一看那些确是活着过，操劳过，耕作过，喝过酒，拉过车，骗过他的主人，或者也许是简单的老实人的农奴们的名字的时候，就起了一种奇特的不舒服的感觉。每条仿佛都有它特殊的性格，农奴们都在自己发挥着一种固有的特征。属于科罗皤契加的农奴，是谁都带着一个什么诨名的。泼留希金的名单，却显出文体之简洁；往往只写着本名和父称的第一个字母，底下是点两点。梭巴开维支的目录，则以他的出格的详细和完备，令人惊奇；连极细微的特性，也无不很注意的加以记载：对于其中之一，写的是：“优秀的木匠。”别一个是：“他懂事，不喝酒。”而且连各人的父母以及品行如何，也写得详详细细。只在菲陀妥夫名下，注有备考道：“父亲不明，母亲是我的一个使女，名凯必妥里娜，但品行方正，不偷盗。”所有一切细目，都给全体以新鲜之气。令人觉得这些农奴们，仿佛昨天还是活着似的。

乞乞科夫再细心的熟读了一回那名字。一种奇特的感动抓住了他了，他叹息一声，低低的自言自语道：“我的上帝，这里紧挤着多少人呀！你们在一生中，做了些什么事呢，可爱的家伙？你们过的是怎样的生活呢？”于是他的眼睛，不知不觉的看在一个名字上面了。那就是曾经属于女地主科罗皤契加的，已经说过的彼得·萨惠略夫·内乌伐柴衣-科卢以多。他就禁不住又喊了一声：“我的上帝，这可真长，得占满一整行哩！你先前是怎样的人呀？是你的手艺的好手，还是个平常的农夫，而且是怎么送命的呢？在酒店里，或者是在大路上，给发昏的车子碾死的，你这废物？——斯台班·泼罗勃加，木匠，驯良，寡欲。——哦，你在这里，我的斯台班·泼罗勃加，好个大英雄，天生的禁卫军哩！你一定是皮带上插着斧头，肩膀上挂着长靴，走遍了许多远路，只吃一戈贝克面包，两戈贝克干鱼，但在你的袋子里，却总带着百来个卢布，或者简直整千的缝在你的麻布裤子里，或是藏在长统靴子里的罢。你死在什么地方的呢？你不过为着赚钱，爬上教堂的圆天井去，还是一直爬到十字架，在荫架上一失脚，就掉了下来，有一个那里的米哈衣伯伯，只好自己搔搔头皮，同情的唠叨道：‘唉唉，凡涅，你这是怎么的呀？’于是亲自用绳子缚了你的身子，悄悄的拖你回家的呢。——玛克辛·台略忒尼科夫，靴匠。靴匠吗？唔？‘靴匠似的喝得烂醉’，谚语里有着的。我知道你，我知道你，我的好乖乖；如果你愿意，我就来讲你一生的历史给你听。你是在一个德国人那里学手艺的，他供你食宿，用皮条罚你的偷懒，还不准出街，省得你去闹事。你是一个真正的古怪脾气人，却不是鞋匠，那德国人和他的太太或则同业谈起你的时候，实在也难以大声的喊出你的好处来。到得学习期满，你就心里想：‘现在我要买一所自己的小房子了，但我不高兴像德国人那样，一文一文的来积，我要一下子就成一个有钱人！’于是你将许多贡款付给了主人，自己开了一个店，收下一大批豫约，做起生意来了。你只化了三分之一的价钱，不知道从那里买了半烂的皮来，每逢卖掉一双长靴，却总要赚两倍，然而你的靴子不到两礼拜就开裂了，这回赚来的是对于你的手段的恶骂。你的店因此没有生意了，你就开始来喝酒，在街上游来荡去，并且说道：‘这世界坏透了！我们俄国人只好饿肚子：害事的第一就是德国人呵！’——唔，这是什么人呢：伊利沙贝土斯·服罗佩以(2)？又见鬼：这是一个女人呀！她怎么跑进这里来的呢？梭巴开维支这流氓，是他偷偷的混在里面的！”乞乞科夫一点也不错：这确是一个女人。她怎么入了这一伙的呢，只有上帝知道；但她的名字却实在写得又聪明又巧妙，能够令人粗粗一看，觉得也确是一个男子，她的本名，是用男性式结末的：伊利沙贝土斯，却不是伊利沙贝多。然而乞乞科夫不管这一点，只在名簿上把它划掉了。——“还有你，‘老是走不到’的格力戈黎，你究竟是怎样的一个人呢？你是车夫，永是离开了你的老家，你的乡土，用一辆三匹马拉的席篷车子，载了商人们在市集里跑来跑去的吗？是你自己的朋友为了一个胖胖的红面庞的兵太太，在路上要了你的性命，还是你的皮手套和你的三匹虽然小，却很强悍的马所拉的车子，中了拦路强盗的意，还是躺在你炕床上，想来想去，忽然无缘无故的跑到酒店去，就在那里的路上，人不知鬼不觉的掉在冰洞(3)里的呢？唉唉，你这我的俄罗斯人呵！你是不喜欢寿终正寝的！——还有你们，我的乖乖，”他向那写着泼留希金的逃走的农奴的名单看了一眼，接着说，“你们大约都还活着的，然而又有什么意思呢？你们就像死掉了的一样。你们的飞快的腿，现在把你们运到那里去了呵！你们在泼留希金家里就真的过得这样坏，还是到树林里彷徨，向旅人劫掠，也不过开开玩笑的呢？你们也许坐在监牢里，还是找到了别的主人，现在正给他在种地呢？耶里米·凯略庚，尼启多，服罗吉多(4)，安敦·服罗吉多，其子，只要看你们的名字，人就知道你们是飞跑的好手了；坡坡夫，仆役……一定是一个学者，知道读书，写字的！他无须手里拿短刀，就会捞到一大批物事。试试看！没有护照，你又落在警察局长的手里了。你勇敢的对面站立着：‘你的主人是谁呀？’那局长讯问说，还看着适宜的机会，在他的话里插下一句厉害的咒骂：——‘是地主某人。’你大胆的回答道。‘你怎么跑到这里来的？’局长问。‘我缴过赎身钱，得了释放的了。’你答得很顺口。‘你的护照在那里呢？’‘在我的主人家，市民批美诺夫那里。’批美诺夫被传来了。‘你是批美诺夫吗？’‘是的。’‘是他给了你护照的吗？’‘不，他没有给我护照。’‘你说谎吗？’局长说，于是又来一句厉害的话。‘是的！’你绝不羞愧的回答道：‘我没有把护照放在他那里，因为我回家太晚了，我是交给了打钟人安替卜·泼罗呵罗夫，托他收管着的。’——‘那么，传打钟人来！他把护照交给了你吗？’‘不，我没有收到他的护照。’‘你为什么又来说谎的？’局长从新问，而且再来一句厉害的话儿，以见其确凿。‘你的护照到底在那里呢？’‘我相信我是确有护照的，’你切实的回答道，‘大约我把它掉在路上的什么地方了。’——‘但是你为什么偷了士兵的外套和神甫的钱箱的呢？’局长道，于是又添上一句挺硬的话儿，以见其确凿。‘并没有，’你说，连睫毛也不动一下，‘我还没有偷过东西。’‘但是人怎么会从你那里搜出外套来的呢？’‘我不知道，大约是别人把它放在我这里的！’——‘啊，你这贱胎，你这畜生！’局长摇着头说，把两手叉在腰上。‘加上脚镣，带他到牢监里去。’——‘就是啦，我遵命！’你回答道。于是你从袋子里摸出鼻烟壶来，很和气的请那正在给你上镣的两个伤兵去嗅，还问他们退伍有多么久了，在什么战争上成了残废的呢。之后是你游进牢监，静静的坐在那里面，直到法庭来开审你的案件。终于下了判决，把你从札来伏·科克夏斯克监狱解到什么监狱去了。那边的法庭，却又远远的送你到威舍贡斯克或是别的什么地方去；你每从这一个监狱游历到别一个监狱，一看你的新住宅，总是说：‘哼，还是威舍贡斯克监狱好，那边地方大，够玩一下抛骨儿(5)，而且伙伴也多呀。’——亚伐空·菲罗夫么？哪，我的好人，还有你呢？你在什么地方逛荡？也许因为你爱自由生活，活在伏尔迦的什么处所，做着拉纤的夫子罢？……”到这里，乞乞科夫住了口，有些沉思起来了。他到底在想什么呢？他想着亚伐空·菲罗夫的运命，还是恰如一切俄国人一样，无论他什么年纪，什么身分和品级，只要一想到自由的无拘无束的人生之乐，就自然而然，几乎是无须说明的那种沉思呢？“但现在菲罗夫究竟在那里呀？他一定快活的夹在商人一伙里，高兴的嚷嚷的在码头上到处闲逛。整一队的拉纤夫，帽子上饰着花朵和丝绦，正和颈挂珠圈，发带花条的他们的瘦长的女人和情人作着别，大声的在吵闹；轮舞回旋着，清歌嘹亮着，快把整个码头闹翻，搬运夫们却在喧嚷，吵闹，勇猛的叫喊中，用钩子起了九普特重的包裹，装在脊梁上，把豌豆和小麦倒进空船里面去，还连袋滚下了燕麦和压碎麦；远处是闪烁着袋子和包裹积叠起来的大堆，好像一座炮弹的金字塔，塞满着空地，这谷麦库巍然高耸，一直要到帆船和船舶装载起来，那走不完的舰队，和春冰一同顺流而去。船夫们呵，你们的工作是很多的，像先前的团结，热心，协力一样，你们至今也还在这么做，汗流被面的拉着船纤，唱着恰如俄罗斯本国一般无穷尽的歌！”

“我的上帝！已经十二点钟了！”乞乞科夫一看表，忽然喊了起来。“我这许多工夫，尽在耽延些什么呀？我还有些正经事要做，却先在说傻话，还在做傻梦，我真是一个傻子！实在的！”他说着这话，就用一件欧罗巴样的换了他那苏格兰样的衣服，把裤子的带扣收紧一点，使他的丰满的肚子不至于十分凸出，洒了阿兑可伦(6)，将温暖的帽子拿在手里，挟着文件，到民事法厅结束买卖合同去了。他的匆促，并非因为怕太迟——这一点是用不着耽心的，厅长是他的好朋友，可以由他的愿意，把办公时间延长或者缩短，恰如荷马(7)的老宙斯(8)一样，倘要停止他所爱惜的英雄们的斗争，或者给与一种方法，将他们救出，就使白天延长，或者一早成为黑夜；然而乞乞科夫是自有其急切的希望的，事情要赶紧结束，越快越好；在还未办妥之间，他总觉得不稳当，不舒服：因为他究竟不能完全忘记这在买卖的并不是真正的魂灵，所以这样的一副担子，还是从速卸下的好。他怀着这样的思想，披着熊皮里子的赭色呢的温暖的外套，刚要走出大街去，却就在横街的转角，和一个也是肩披熊皮里子的外套，头戴连着耳遮的皮帽的绅士冲撞了。绅士发出一声欢呼来——那是玛尼罗夫。两个人就互相拥抱，在这地方大约这样的过了五分钟。于是互相接吻，很有劲，很热烈，至于后来门牙都痛了一整天。因为欢喜，玛尼罗夫的脸上就只剩了鼻子和嘴唇，他的眼睛是简直不见了，他用两只手捏住了乞乞科夫的手。约有十五分钟之久，一直到乞乞科夫的手热得很。他用了最优美，最亲热的态度，述说了自己怎样为了拥抱保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，所以飞到这里来，并且用一种恭维话收尾，这一种话，平常是大概请年青女郎一同跳舞才说的。当玛尼罗夫从他那皮外套里，取出一卷粉红带子束着的纸来的时候，乞乞科夫可真不知道应该怎样道谢了，他只不过张着嘴巴。

“这是什么？”

“这是农奴们。”

“哦！”——他连忙打开纸卷，很快的看了一遍，那笔迹的美丽和匀净，真使他吃了惊了。“这可写得真好！”他说。“简直无须眷清了。而且还画着边线！画了这出色的边线的是谁呢？”

“唉，您还不如不问罢。”玛尼罗夫说。

“您？”

“我的内人！”

“阿呀，我的上帝！这真叫我抱歉得很，我竟累您们费了这么多的力！”

“为了保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，我们效点力是不算什么的！”

乞乞科夫感谢的一鞠躬。当玛尼罗夫听到他要到民事法厅去办妥买卖合同的时候，就自己声明，可以做领导。两个朋友就手挽着手，一同走下去。遇见每一个小高处，每一个土冈或者每一个高低，玛尼罗夫总用手搀着乞乞科夫，几乎要擎起来，并且愉快地微笑着说，他是不肯使保甫尔·伊凡诺维支吃苦的。乞乞科夫颇为惶窘，不知道自己应该怎样感谢，因为他觉得，他实在也并不轻。他们俩这样的互相提携着，一直到那法院所在的广场上——是一所三层楼的大屋子，白得像一块石灰，这大概是象征着在这里办公的人员们的纯洁的。广场上的另外的房屋，以大小而论，都卑陋得不能和石造的官厅相比。这是：一间守卫室，前面站着一个拿枪的兵，两三处待雇马车的停留场，临了是处处还有些上面照例划着木炭或粉笔的书画的长板壁。除此以外，在这冷静的，或者如我们俄国人的说法，是好看的广场上，再也看不到什么东西了。从二楼或三楼的窗里，露出几个台弥斯(9)法师的廉洁的头来，但即刻又缩了回去，一定是长官走进这屋子里来了罢。两位朋友同上楼梯去，不是走，却是急急忙忙的跑，因为乞乞科夫不愿意玛尼罗夫用手来扶他，便放快了脚步，但这一面因为不愿意乞乞科夫疲乏，便也跑上前去了，于是到得走上昏暗的长廊时，两个人就都弄得上气接不着下气。长廊和大厅的干净，他们都没有特别诧异。那时是还不很管这些的，龌龊了，就听它龌龊，决不装出很适意，很好看的外观来。台弥斯完全以她的本相见客，穿着常服和睡衣。我们的主角们所走过的办公室，我们原也应该记载一下的，但在凡是衙门之前，作者却怀着一种大大的敬畏。即使有了机会，在最煊赫的时期，去见识和历览那很华贵的景况，就是上蜡的地板和新漆的桌椅，他也是恭谨的顺下眼睛，急忙走过，所以那地方的一切如何出色，如何繁华之类，也还是不会觉得的。我们的主角们，是看见了一大批纸张，空白的和写满的，俯在桌上的脑袋，宽阔的颈子，小地方做的燕尾服和常礼服，或者只是一件普通的淡灰色的小衫，这和别的衣服一对照，就显得非常惹眼，那人却侧着头，几乎躺在纸上，用了很流走的笔致，在写一件报告；这大约是关于一宗田产的案件，那平和的所有者，是什么地方的地主，他为此涉了一世讼，也在他的产业的安静的享用里，生育了儿孙，但现在却要失掉，或者是他的什么地方要被抄没了。有时也听到一点很短的句子，那是用沙声说出来的：“菲陀舍·菲陀舍维支，请您递给我三六八号的文件！您怎么总捞了公家的墨水瓶塞子去！他是在政府里的呀！”间或有一种尊严的声音，分明是长官所发，命令式的叱咤道：“喂，再去抄过，要不然，我就把你脱掉靴子，关你六整天没有东西吃！”

笔尖刮纸的声音，非常之响，那喧闹，好像几辆装着枯枝的车子，走过一个树林，在道路上，又积着四阿耳申(10)之高的枯叶一样。

乞乞科夫和玛尼罗夫走向坐着两个年青官员的第一顶桌子去，探问他们道：“请教！您可以告诉我，这里的契据课是在那里么？”

“您什么事呀？”两个官都转过身来，一齐的说。

“我要递一个请求书。”

“您买了什么了？”

“我先要知道的，是契据课在那里？这里呢，还是别地方？”

“请您先告诉我们您买了什么东西，什么价钱，那么我们就告诉您应该到那里去。这样可是不行的！”

乞乞科夫立刻觉到，这两个也如一切年青的官员们一样，不过是好奇，也想借此把自己和自己的地位弄得紧要一点，显豁一点。

“请您听一下，我的可敬的先生们，”他说，“我知道得很清楚，凡有关于买卖契约的一切事务，是统归一个科里管理的，我在请求您的就是教给我这地方，我应该往那里走，如果您不知道这地方在那里，那么，我们还是去问别人罢！”这时那两个官就一句话也没有答，有一个只用一个指头指着一间房子，里面坐着一位正在编排文件的老人。乞乞科夫和玛尼罗夫便从桌子之间，一直走过去。那老人一心不乱的在办公。

“我要请教，”乞乞科夫行一个礼，说，“这里是契据课么？”

那老人抬起眼来，慢吞吞的说道：“不，这里不是契据课。”

“那么，在那里呢？”

“这是契约课管的。”

“但是契约课在那里呢？”

“伊凡·安敦诺维支这里。”

“但伊凡·安敦诺维支在那里呢？”

那老人用指头向别的一个屋角上一指，于是乞乞科夫和玛尼罗夫便到伊凡·安敦诺维支那里去了。伊凡·安敦诺维文本已用一只眼睛，从旁在瞥着他们了的，但又立刻向着他的纸张，拼命的写起来了。

“我想请教，这里可是契据课呢？”乞乞科夫行着礼，一面说。

伊凡·安敦诺维支似乎没有听到，因为他只在拼命的办公，并不回答。人立刻可以看出，他已是中年了，不再像那些年青的话匣子和轻骨头。大约伊凡·安敦诺维支是已经上了四十岁的；有一头浓密的黑发，那脸面的中间部，凸得很高，大有集中于鼻子之概；一句话，这样的相貌，我们这里是普通叫作“壶瓶脸”的。

“我想请教，契据课在那里呢？”乞乞科夫再说一遍。

“这里。”伊凡·安敦诺维支说，这时他把高鼻子略略一抬，但即刻又写下去了。

“我来办理的是这样的事情：为了移住的目的，我从这省的几个地主买了—些农奴；合同已经带来了，只要注一注册。”

“出主同来了吗？”

“有几个在这里了，别的几个我有委托信。”

“您也带了请求书来了？”

“是的，带在这里！我想……我非常之忙……这事情今天就可以办了吗？”

“哼！今天！不，今天是不行的。”伊凡·安敦诺维支说。“也还得调查一下，看看可有已经抵押出去的。”

“不过伊凡·格力戈利也维支，这里的厅长，是我的一个好朋友；他该肯把这事情赶办一下的罢。”

“但这里可也不只伊凡·格力戈利也维支在办事，还有别的人们呀。”伊凡·安敦诺维支不大高兴的说。

这时乞乞科夫明白其中的底细了，于是说道：“别人大概也肯照应的。我自己就在办公，知道这程序。”

“您还是找伊凡·格力戈利也维支去，”伊凡·安敦诺维支说，和气了一点，“他会派定谁办的。和我们没有关系。”

乞乞科夫从衣袋里掏出一张钞票来，放在伊凡·安敦诺维支的面前。那人却毫不在意，立刻用一本书遮上了。乞乞科夫还想通知他，但伊凡·安敦诺维支又把头一摇，告诉他不必如此。

“他领你们到办公室去！”伊凡·安敦诺维支说，还点点头。于是在场的一位大法师，他为了拼命的为女神台弥斯效劳，弄到两袖的肘弯都开了裂，从洞里吐出后面的里子来，但也得了十四等官的品级，就必恭必敬的走到我们的两位朋友跟前，像先前斐尔吉留斯的领导但丁(11)似的引他们往办公室去了，这里摆着一些宽阔的靠椅，在其中的一把上，在法鉴(12)和两本厚书之前，巍然的坐着厅长，好像太阳神。一到这里，新斐尔吉留斯便敬畏得连他脚也重到跨不开了。于是他向后转，把破得像一片席子上粘着鸡毛的背后，示给了两位朋友。当他们走进屋里时，才看见厅长并不是独自一个人，旁边还坐着梭巴开维支，完全被法鉴所遮掩。客人的到来，使在场的人发了几声欢呼，厅长的椅子格格的响着，被推到一边去。梭巴开维支也起来了，拖着他的长袖子，整个清清楚楚站在那里。厅长来和乞乞科夫拥抱，办公室里又起了一通朋友的接吻声。他们彼此问过好，由此知道了两个人都腰痛，算是因为生平大抵安坐不动而得的。厅长好像已经从梭巴开维支听到了置产的事情，因为他很诚恳的向乞乞科夫道贺，这使我们的主角有一点窘急，尤其是现在，那两位出主，梭巴开维支和玛尼罗夫，他原是分头秘密说定的，现在却面对面的站着了。但他还是谢了厅长，于是向着梭巴开维支道：

“您好吗？”

“谢谢上帝，我不能说坏。”梭巴开维支说，而且实在，他也真的没有说坏的理由，比起这生得奇特的地主来，倒是一块铁先会受寒，咳嗽的。

“是的，您的健康，可真是出色，”厅长说，“您那故去的令尊，也和您一样结实的。”

“是的，他还独自去打熊哩！”梭巴开维支回答道。

“我想，如果您独自和一只熊交手，您也足够摔倒它的。”厅长说。

“那里，我可不成，”梭巴开维支答道，“我那先父可比我还要强。”于是他叹息着接下去道，“那里，现在可是没有这样的人了。您就拿我的生活来做例子罢。这是什么生活，不过如此，哼哼……”

“为什么您的生活没有意思呢？”厅长问。

“没有，实在不能说是有意思，”梭巴开维支说，摇着头，“您自己想想就是，伊凡·格力戈利也维支，我已经五十岁了，没有遭过一回喉痛，没有生过一个疮……这可不会有好结果的！这总有一回要算账的……”说到这里，梭巴开维支就非常忧郁了。

“这家伙……”乞乞科夫和厅长几乎同时想。“那里是不说坏呀！”

“我还带了一封给您的信来呢。”乞乞科夫从袋子里取出泼留希金的信来，一面说。

“谁给的？”厅长问道。他接过信去，开了封，惊奇的叫了起来道：“泼留希金的！他也还生存在这世界上吗？这也是一种生活呀！先前是一个多么聪明，多么富裕的人呵！但现在……”

“是一匹猪狗了！”梭巴开维支说。“是这样的一个恶棍，使他那所有的人们都饿肚子！”

“可以，很愿意！”厅长看过信札之后，大声说。“我很高兴给他代理的！这宗交易，您希望怎么结束呢？现在就办，还是等一下？”

“就办！”乞乞科夫说。“我正想拜托您，费神在今天就办一办。因为我明天就要走了，买卖合同和请求书都带来在这里！”

“好得很，但您明天要走，我们可不能这么早就放你的。注册是马上就办，您却还得在这里和我们过几天。我就发命令。”他说着，开开了通到办公室的门。那里面满是官员，像一群蜜蜂的围着蜂房一样，如果可以把文件比作蜂房的话：“伊凡·安敦诺维支在这里吗？”

“有！在这里！”屋子中间，有一个声音回答道。

“来一下！”

读者已经熟识的壶瓶脸伊凡·安敦诺维支，在官厅里出现了，行一个恭敬的礼。

“伊凡·安敦诺维支，请您拿了这些契约去，并且……”

“伊凡·格力戈利也维支，”梭巴开维支插嘴道，“请您不要忘记，我们还得要见证呢，至少每一面有两个。请您马上去邀检事来罢，他没有什么事，一定坐在家里的：代理的梭罗土哈(13)，什么事情都替他办掉了；像梭罗土哈那样的大强盗，在这世界上是不会再有的！卫生监督也不大办事，大约总在家里的，如果他不去找熟人打牌的话；哦哦，还有住在近地的一大批人们在这里呢：德鲁哈且夫斯基，培古希金——都是用他们的幽闲，使可爱的大地受不住的人物！”

“不错！一点不错！”厅长说着，立刻派一个事务员去邀请他们去了。

“我还要拜托您一件事，”乞乞科夫说，“请您再邀一个女地主的代理人来，我和她也成了一点小交易的——那是住持法师希理耳神甫的儿子；他就在您们这里做事。”

“可以可以，我马上派人去叫他！”厅长说。“这算是一切都办好了，我只还要拜托您一件事，请您不要给官们什么。我的朋友是用不着破费的。”于是他又向伊凡·安敦诺维支下了一道看来好像实在不大称心的命令。这合同，仿佛对于厅长给了一种很好的印象似的，尤其是当他看见买价将近十万卢布的时候。他凝视着乞乞科夫的眼睛，有几分钟之久，终于说道：“您看，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支。您可真的收了一大批了！”

“哦哦，是的！”乞乞科夫回答说。

“这是好事情呀。真的！这是好事情！”

“对啦，现在我自己想，我也不能做什么更好的事了。无论如何，人生的目的，并不是什么自由思想家所追寻的荒诞的年青时候的空想，倘不脚踏实地，是决不定终局的方法的。”他趁这机会，不但用几句责备的句子，攻击了青年们和他们的自由主义，并且也是法律上的话。然而，很该留心的是他的话里总还含着一点不妥之处，仿佛他又就要接着说出来道：“哼，什么？乖乖，你说谎而且不轻哩！”真的，他竟不敢向梭巴开维支和玛尼罗夫看一眼，因为怕在他们的脸上，遇见一种不舒服的表情。但他的忧愁并没有用；梭巴开维支的脸上毫无变化，玛尼罗夫却完全被这名言所感动，赏识得只在颠头簸脑，并且那精神的贯注，恰如一个知音者遇到歌女压倒了弦索，发出她那赛过莺歌的妙音的时候一样了。

“您怎么不告诉伊凡·格力戈利也维支的呢，您究竟买了些什么？”梭巴开维支指点道。“还有您呢，伊凡·格力戈利也维支？您竟全没有问，他买的是些什么吗？您要知道，那是多么出色的家伙呵！钱算什么！我连做车子的米锡耶夫也卖给他了。”

“真的？没有罢？”厅长拦着说。“我知道这米锡耶夫；这人在他的一门，是一个好手；他给我修过一回车子的。但请您原谅一下……这是怎么的呢？……您不是对我说过的吗，他死了……”

“谁？米锡耶夫死了？”梭巴开维支一点也不惶窘，回问道。“您说的是他的兄弟，那确是死了；这一个却是好好的，像水里的鱼一样；比先前还要好。不久以前，还给我做了一辆这样的马车，您就是到莫斯科去也买不出。这人是可以称为皇家御匠的。”

“不错，米锡耶夫是一个好手，”厅长接着说，“但我很奇怪，您竟肯这么轻易的把他放掉。”

“是呀，如果单单一个米锡耶夫呢！还有斯台班·泼罗勃加，那个木匠，烧砖头的弥卢锡金，靴匠玛克辛·台略忒尼科夫——他们都去了，我把他们一起卖掉了。”但当厅长问他这些都是家务上有用的工人，为什么竟肯放走的时候，梭巴开维支却做了一个毫不在意的手势，回答道：“我不知道，不过我起了胡涂想头就是！我自己想：唉，什么，我卖掉他们罢，那就胡里胡涂的真的把他们卖掉了！”于是他垂下头去，好像现在倒后悔起来模样，还接着说道：“年纪大了，头发白了，还是不聪明！”

“但请您允许我问一声，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，”厅长问，“您买了不带田地的农奴，究竟是做什么的呢？莫非目的是在使他们移住么？”

“自然是移住！”

“哦，那自然又作别论了。但移到那里去呀？”

“移到……到赫尔生省去。”

“阿，那是很出色的地方！”厅长说，又称赞了一番那地方的草之好和长。

“您的田地够用吗？”

“很够——给农奴移住的这一点，是绰绰有余的。”

“那地方也有一条河吗，还不过一个池子？”

“有一条河。另外也还有一个池子。”说到这里，乞乞科夫不觉看了梭巴开维支一眼，那人虽然照旧的毫无动静，但乞乞科夫却觉得仿佛在他的脸上，看出了这样的句子来：“你撒谎，我的宝贝！我就不很相信真的有池子，有河和一切田地哩。”

在他们继续着谈天之间，见证人渐渐的出现了：首先是检事，就是读者已经认识，总在着左眼的那一位，卫生局监督，还有德鲁哈且夫斯基先生，培古希金先生以及别的，即梭巴开维支之所谓用他们的幽闲，使大地受不住的人物。其中的好些位，是连乞乞科夫也还是全不相识的，缺少的证人，就请一两个官员充了数。不但住持法师希理耳神甫的儿子，连住持法师自己也被邀到了。每个见证人，都连自己的一切品级和勋等，在文件上签了名，这一个用圆体字，那一个用斜体字；第三个用的是所谓翻筋斗字，或者洒出俄国字母里从未见过的文字来。那令人佩服的伊凡·安敦诺维支，又敏捷又切实的办妥了一切，契约登记了，日子填上了，册里存根了，而且又送到该去的地方去了，此外只要付半成的注册费，以及官报上的揭示费就够，乞乞科夫只化了很少的钱。哦，厅长就下命令，注册费只要他付给一半，那别的一半，却算在别个请求人的身上了。这是怎么办的呢，老天爷知道。

“那么，”到诸事全都恭喜停当了之后，厅长说，“这事情，我们就只差一个润一润了。”

“非常愿意，”乞乞科夫说，“时候请您定。如果在这样愉快的聚会里，我这边不肯开一两瓶香槟，那可是一宗罪过哩。”

“不，您弄错了：香槟我们自己办，”厅长说，“这是我们的义务和责任。您是我们的客人，要我们招待的。您知道吗，我的绅士诸君？我们姑且跑到警察局长那里去罢，他是一个真正的魔术师；如果他到鱼市场或者酒铺子里去走一转，只要眼睛一，就会变出一桌出色的午餐来，可以用这来贺喜。趁这机会，我们还可以打一回牌。”

一个这样有道理的提议，是没有人能反对的。单是提出鱼市场这一句话，就使见证人们的嘴里流满了唾沫；大家立刻抓起了有边帽和无边帽，公事就这样的收场。当人们走过办公室时，伊凡·安敦诺维支——就是那壶瓶脸——向乞乞科夫谦虚的鞠一个躬，说道：“您买了十万卢布的农奴，我效了力，却只有一张白钞票(14)。”

“是的，但那是怎样的农奴呀，”乞乞科夫低声的回答道，“全是些不行的，没用的人儿，还值不到那价钱的一半哩。”伊凡·安敦诺维支就明白了他是一个性格坚定的人，从他那里，自己是再也捞不到什么的了。

“泼留希金卖给您魂灵，是什么一个价钱呀？”梭巴开维支在他的别一只耳朵边悄悄的说。

“但是您为什么把服罗佩以混了进去的？”乞乞科夫回答道。

“那个服罗佩以？”梭巴开维支问。

“就是那个女人，伊利沙贝多呀。您还把语尾改了‘土斯’了。”

“我可不知道这服罗佩以。”梭巴开维支说着，混进别的客人里去了。

大家排成大队，进了警察局长的家里。这警察局长可真是一位魔术师；他刚听到该做的事情，就已经叫了警务员来，是一位穿磁漆长靴的精干的脚色，好像在他耳朵边不过悄悄的说了两句话；于是又简单的问他道：“你懂了吗？”而当客人们还在摸牌的时候，别一间屋里的桌子上，可早摆出顶出色的东西来了：鲟鱼，蝶鲛，熏鲑鱼，新的腌鱼子，陈的腌鱼子，青鱼，鲶鱼，各种干酪，熏的舌头——这都是从鱼市场搬来的食单。此外还添了自家厨房里做出来的几样：鱼肉包子，馅是九普特重的鲟鱼的软骨和颊肉做的，磨菇包子，油炸包子，松脆糕饼之类。讲老实话，警察局长可确是这市镇的父母和恩人。他在市民之间，就和在他自己的家族之间一样，他很会替店铺或布行来安排，也像在自己的仓库里一样。要而言之，如大家所常说，他是总在他的地位上，尽着下文似的职务的。是他为了他的官而设，还是他的官为了他而设的呢，这可实在很难决定。他极善于做官，所以他的收入虽然比前任几乎要多一倍，却仍被全市镇所爱戴。先是商人们尤其特别的珍重他，因为他毫不骄傲；而且也实在的，他给他们的孩子行洗礼，自己去做教父，虽然也很挤些他们的血，但连这也做得非常之聪明：或者亲热的拍拍肩膀，向他们微微一笑，或者邀他们去喝茶，招他们去打牌，于是问起生意怎样，万事如何，如果知道谁的孩子生着病，他就会立刻给与忠告，开出适当的药味来；一言以蔽之，他实在是一个好脚色。就是坐着马车，到各处巡视秩序的时候，也总在找人讲话：“喂，米哈伊支，我们总该玩一下我们的小玩艺罢？”——“自然，亚历舍·伊凡诺维支，”那人回答着，脱了帽，“我们自然得玩一下的！”“听哪，伊理亚·派拉摩诺维支，什么时候到我这里来，看看我的快马罢；它跑的比你那匹还要快；之后就驾在赛跑马车上，我们来看一下究竟怎样！”那酷爱赛马的商人，便万分满足的微笑起来，摸着胡子，说道：“好的，我们来看一下，亚历舍·伊凡诺维支！”这时连店员们也都除下了帽子，愉快的凝视着，似乎想要说：“亚厉舍·伊凡诺维支真是一个出色的人！”一言以蔽之，他很随俗，商人们对他倒有很佩服的意思，说道：“亚历舍·伊凡诺维支确也拿得多一点，但他的话却也靠得住的。”

謦察局长看得午餐已经齐备，便向他的客人们提议，还是用膳之后，再来打牌，于是大家就都走进食堂去，从这处所，是早有一股可爱的香味，一直透进邻室来的。这种香味，久已很愉快的引得我们的客人的鼻孔发痒，梭巴开维支也已经从门口望过筵席，把旁边一点的躺在一张大盘子里的鲟鱼看在眼里的了。客人们喝过黑绿的阿列布色的烧酒，这种颜色，是只能在俄国用它雕刻图章的透明的西伯利亚的石头上才会看见的，于是用叉子武装起来，从各方面走向食桌去。这时候，真如谚语所说，谁都现出真的性格和嗜好来了，这个吃鱼子，那个拿鲑鱼，第三个弄干酪。对于这些小东西，梭巴开维支却一眼也不看，一径就跑向邻近的鲟鱼那里去，在别人都在吃，喝，谈天之间，只消短短的一刻钟，就吃得干干净净，待到警察局长记起了这鱼，说道：“您尝尝这天然产物罢，看怎样，我的绅士诸君！”一面带领大家，手里都捏着叉子，一同走近鲟鱼去的时候，却看见这天然产物只还剩下一个尾巴了；但梭巴开维支却显得和这件事全不相干，走向旁边的一个盘子去，用叉戳着一尾很小的干鱼。吃完了鲟鱼之后，梭巴开维支就埋在一把靠椅里，什么也不再吃喝，不过还在着眼睛了。看模样，警察局长是不喜欢省酒的。第一回的干杯，恐怕读者自己也猜得到，是为了赫尔生省的新地主的健康。第二回，是为了他那农奴们的平安和他的幸福的移住。于是再为他未来的体面漂亮的夫人的健康痛饮，我们的主角就露出快活的微笑来。于是大家都拥到他面前来，劝他在这市里，至少也得再留两礼拜。“不行的，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！刚跨进门，立刻又走，这就是停也不停！不行的，在我们这里再过几时罢！您在这里，我们还要给您做媒哩。伊凡·格力戈利也维支，我们来给他找一个太太，可好？”

“好的，好的，找一个太太！”厅长附和着说。“就是您用两手两脚来反抗，您也得结亲。我的好人，没法办！跟着做，跟着走！您也无须多话，我们是不喜欢开玩笑的！”

“怎么，我为什么要用两手两脚来反抗呢？结亲并不是这么一回事，立刻就……首先得有一个新娘子。”

“有的是新娘子呀！怎么会没有呢？您要怎么的，就有怎么的。”

“那么，如果这样子……”

“好极，他停下了！”大家都叫喊起来。“万岁，呼尔啦！保甫尔·伊凡诺维支呼尔啦！”于是手里拿着杯子，跑过来要和乞乞科夫碰杯。乞乞科夫对大家都一一的碰过。

“再来一回！”热昏了的人们说，就只好再碰了一回；而且他们还要碰第三回，于是就又碰了第三回。在这暂时之间，大家都非常高兴。厅长在快活的时候，是一个极其可爱的人，屡次抱着乞乞科夫，感动之余，吃吃的说道：“我的亲爱的心肝，我的亲爱的妈妈子！”真的，他还响着指头，绕了乞乞科夫跳舞起来了，一面唱着有名的民歌道：“你这狗入的呀！你这可玛令斯克的种地的呀！”香槟之后，又喝匈牙利葡萄酒，使景况更加活泼，集会更加愉快了起来。打牌是忘记得一干二净了：大家嚷叫着，争辩着，谈论着一切可谈和不可谈的事情——政治，甚而至于军事问题，都发表着自由的意见，倘在平常时候，是即使他自己的孩子，也要因此吃一顿痛打的。一大批非常烦难的问题，都在这时机得了解决。乞乞科夫却还不到这么高兴，他觉得自己已经真是赫尔生省的地主，在讲各种经济上的革新和改良，三圃制度的耕种法，两个精神的幸福与和合，还对梭巴开维支朗诵了一封维特写给夏绿蒂(15)的押韵的信，但对手却不过眼睛，因为他埋在靠椅里，吃了鲟鱼之后，实在想要睡觉了。乞乞科夫也立刻悟到自己不免过了分，就托找一辆车，到底是借了检事的马车，回到自己的家去。那车夫，从中途就可以看出他是一个老练的能手，因为他只用一只手拉着缰绳，别一只却反过来紧紧的抓住了沉思着摇来晃去的乞乞科夫。他坐着检事的马车，这样的回到旅馆来，还讲了许多工夫种种的呆话：讲黄头发，红面庞，右颊有一个酒窝的新娘，讲赫尔生省的田产，讲资本金以及这一类的许多事。绥里方也奉到各种关于管理田产的命令：例如他应该把新的移住的农奴全体召集，一个一个的来点名。绥里方默默的听了好久，终于走出屋子去了，只先向彼得尔希加说了一声：“喂，给老爷去脱掉衣服！”彼得尔希加首先是去替乞乞科夫脱长靴，几乎连他的人也要从眠床上拉下。到底脱掉了，主人就像平常一样，自己脱衣服，再在床上翻滚了几分钟，翻得眠床都格格的发响，于是乎真的算是赫尔生省的地主而睡去了。其时彼得尔希加便把裤子和发闪的越橘色的燕尾服搬到前房来，挂在木制的钩子上，用毛刷和衣拍拼命的刷呀拍，弄得一条廊下都好像尘头滚滚。他刚要取下衣服来的时候，却望见绥里方从弄堂走出，那是刚由马房里回来的。他们的眼睛相会了，也就仿佛出于本能似的，彼此立刻懂得：老爷睡着了，为什么不到那个酒馆子里去跑一趟呢？彼得尔希加赶紧又把燕尾服和裤子搬进屋里去，走下扶梯来，关于旅行的目的，一字不提，两个人只谈着平常的闲天，走到外面去了。他们的散步，是不必许多时光的，无非穿过街道，向着一所正和旅馆对面的房屋，走进低矮的，熏得乌黑的玻璃门，到了地窖一般的酒馆里，在这里，早有一人群各色各样的人在等候他们了：刮过胡子和不刮的，穿着皮袍和没穿的，只穿一件短衫的，也间有穿了外套的。彼得尔希加和绥里方在这里怎样消遣他们的时光的呢——只有敬爱的上帝知道；够了，一个钟头之后，他们就臂膊挽着臂膊，默默的走了出来，好像彼此都非常小心，而且大家注意着每一条街的转角。之后是还是臂膊挽着臂膊，也不肯暂时分离一下，足有一刻钟之久，这才走完扶梯，好容易到得楼上。彼得尔希加对着他的矮床，站了一会，静静的想着，像在想他怎么才可以睡得最好，于是横着躺下了，两脚都碰在地板上。绥里方也爬到这床上去，他的头就枕了彼得尔希加的肚皮；他已经全然忘记，这并非他自己的卧处，而他的铺位，是在什么地方的下房里，或是马房里的马匹旁边的了。两人立刻睡去了，起了极有力，极壮大的打鼾，那主人却由鼻子里发出一种轻软的声息，和他们的相和鸣。这之后，全旅馆也都寂静了，所有居人，都入了酣睡；只在一个小窗里，还闪烁着微弱的灯光；这地方就住着那从略山到来的中尉，好像对于长靴，是有很大的嗜好的，因为已经定做了四双，现在又在试穿第五双了。他屡次走到床前去，想脱下长靴来睡觉，然而还是决不定：长靴做得真好，他总是翘起了一只脚，极惬意的看着非常等样的靴后跟。

第八章


乞乞科夫的农奴购买，已经成为市镇上谈话的对象了。人们争辩，交谈，还研究那为了移住的目的，来购买农奴，到底是否有利。其中的许多讨论，是以确切和客观出色的：“自然有益，”一个说，“南省的地土，又好又肥，那是不消说得，但没有水，可教乞乞科夫的农奴怎么办呢？那地方是没有河的呀。”——“那倒还不要紧，就是没有河，也还不算什么的，斯台班·特密忒里维支；不过移民是一件很没把握的事情。谁都知道，农奴是怎么的：他搬到新地方去种地——那地方可是什么也没有——没有房屋，也没有庄园——我对你们说，他是要跑掉的，准得像二二如四一样，系好他的靴子，他走了，到找到他，您得费许多日子！”——“不不，请您原谅，亚历舍·伊凡诺维支，我可全不是您那样的见解。如果您说，农奴们是要从乞乞科夫那里逃走的。一个真的俄罗斯人，是什么事情都做得来，什么气候都住得惯的。您只要给他一双温暖的手套，那么，您要送他到那里去，就到那里去，就是一直到康木卡太也不要紧。他会跑一下，取点暖，捏起斧头，造一间新屋子的。”——“然而亲爱的伊凡·格力戈利也维支，你可把一件事情完全忘掉了：你竟全没想到，乞乞科夫买了去的是怎样的农奴。你全忘了，一个地主是决不肯这么轻易的放走一个好家伙的，如果不是酒鬼，醉汉，以及撒野，偷懒的东西，你拿我的脑袋去。”——“是了，这我也同意，没有人肯卖掉一个好家伙，乞乞科夫的人们大概多半是酒鬼，那自然是对的，但还应该想一想历来的道德：刚才也许确是一条懒虫，然而如果把他一迁移，就能突然变成一个诚实的奴仆。这在世界上，在历史上，也不是初见的例子了。”——“不——不然，”国立工厂的监督说，“您要相信我，这是决不然的，因为对于乞乞科夫的农奴，现有两个大敌在那里。第一敌——是和小俄罗斯的各省相近，那地方，谁都知道，卖酒是自由的。我敢对你们断定，只要两礼拜，他们便浸在酒里，成为游惰汉和偷懒的了。第二敌——是放浪生活的习惯和嗜好，这是他们从移住学来的。乞乞科夫必须看定，管住，他应该把他们管得严，每一件小事情，都要罚得重，什么也不托别人做，都是自己来，必要的时候，就给鞭子，打嘴巴。”——“为什么乞乞科夫要亲自去给鞭子呢？他可以用一个监督的。”——“好，您找得到很合适的监督吗？那简直都是骗子和流氓！”——“这是因为主人自己不内行，他们这才成为骗子的。”——“对啦。”许多人插嘴说。——“如果地主自己懂一点田产上的事务，明白他的人们——那么，他总能找到好监督。”然而国立工厂的监督抗议了，以为五千卢布以下，是找不到好监督的。审判厅长却指摘说，只用三千卢布，也就能够找一个，于是监督质问道：“您豫备从那里去找他呢？您能够从您的鼻子里挖出他来吗？”审判厅长的回答是：“鼻子里当然挖不出来的，那不成。不过这里，就在这区里，却是有一个，就是彼得·彼得洛维支·萨木倚罗夫，如果乞乞科夫要他来监督他的农奴，却正是合式的人物！”许多人试把自己置身在乞乞科夫的地位上，和这一大群农奴移住到陌生地方去，就觉得忧愁，真是一件大难事；大家尤其害怕的是像乞乞科夫的农奴那样不稳当的材料，还会造起反来。这时警察局长注意说，造反倒是不足虑的；要阻止它，谢上帝幸而正有一个权力：就是审判厅长。审判厅长也全不必亲自出马，只要送了帽子去，这帽子，就足够使农奴们复归于理性，回心转意，静静的回到家里去了。对于乞乞科夫的农奴们所怀抱的造反性，许多人也发表了意见和重要的提议。那想头可实在非常两样。有主张过度的军营似的严厉和出格的苛酷的，但也有别的，表示着所谓温和。警察局长便加以注意，乞乞科夫现在是看见当面有着神圣的义务的，他可以作为自己的农奴们的父亲，而且照他爱用的口气说，则是在他们之间，广施慈善的教化。趁这机会，他还把现代教育的兰凯斯太法(1)，大大的称赞了一通。

市镇里在这样的谈论，商量，有些人还因为个人的趣向，把他们的意见传给了乞乞科夫，供给他妥善的忠告，也有愿作护卫，把农奴稳稳当当的送到目的地去的。对于忠告，乞乞科夫很谦恭的致了谢，声明他当随时施用，然而谢绝了护卫，说这完全是多余的事情；由他购买下来的农奴，全是特别驯良的性格。他们自愿一同迁移，心里非常高兴。造反，是无论如何不会有的。

凡有这些议论和谈天，都给乞乞科夫招致了他正在切望的极好的结果。传说散布开来了，说他是一个百万财产的富翁，不会多，可也不会少。在第一章上我们已经见过，对于乞乞科夫，本市的居民是即使没有这回的事，原也很是喜欢了他的。况且老实说：他们真的都是好人，彼此和善的往来，亲密的生活，他们的谈话上，也都打着极其诚实和温和的印记的。“敬爱的朋友，伊理亚·伊理支！”“听哪，安谛派多·萨哈略维支，我的好人！”“你撒谎，妈妈子，伊凡·格力戈利也维支！”向着叫作伊凡·安特来也维支的邮政局长，人往往说：“司泼列辛·齐·德意支(2)，伊凡·安特来也维支？”

总而言之，那地方是过得很像家族一样的。许多人很有教养：审判厅长还暗记着当时还算十分时髦的修可夫斯基(3)的《路特米拉》，很有些读得非常巧妙，例如那诗句：“森林入睡，山谷就眠”就是，最出色的是从他嘴里读出“眠”字来，令人觉得好像真的看见山谷睡了觉，为要更加神似起见，到这时候，他还连自己也闭上了眼睛。邮政局长较倾向于哲学，整夜很用功的读着雍格(4)的《夜》和厄凯支好然(5)的《神奇启秘》，还做了很长的摘录；摘的是些什么呢，当然没有人能够分明决定。除此之外，他还是一个大滑稽家，他有华丽的言语，据他自己说，也喜欢把他的话“装饰”起来。而且他实在是用了一大批繁文把他的话装饰起来的，例如：“亲爱的先生，那是这样的，您可知道，您可明白，您可以想象出来的，大概，所谓……”以及别的许许多，他都大有心得；另外他又很适当的用一种意味深长的眼，来装饰他的话，或者简直闭上一只眼睛，给人从他那讽刺的比喻里，觉出很凶的表现来。别的绅士们也大抵是很有教养，非常开通的人物：这一个看凯兰辛(6)，那一个看《莫斯科新报》(7)，第三个索性什么也不看。有一个，是大家叫作“睡帽”的，如果要他去做事，首先总得使劲的在他胁肋上冲一下，别一个却简直完全是懒骨头，一生都躺在熊皮上，想要推他起来罢，什么力气都白费，于是他也就总不起来了。看他们的外观，自然都是漂亮，体面，殷勤足以感人的人物——生肺病的，其中一个也没有。他们是全属于这一种人种里面的，在只有四只眼睛的温柔的互相爱抚的时候，往往用这样的话来称女人：我的胖儿，我的亲爱的大肚子，我的羔子，我的壶卢儿，我的叭儿之类。然而大抵是良善的种族，可爱的，大度的人物，一个人如果做过他们的客，或者同桌打过一夜牌，就很快的和他们亲密起来，十之九变成他们之一了。——在擅长妙法的乞乞科夫，就更加如此，因为他确是知道着令人喜爱的秘密的。他们热爱着他，至于使他决不定怎样离开这里的方法；他总只听见：“唉唉，只要再一礼拜；请您在我们这里再停一个礼拜罢，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支。”——一言以蔽之，如谚语所说，他成为掌珠了。然而出格的强有力，出格的显著，唔，非常之惊人，非常之奇特的，却是乞乞科夫对于闺秀们的印象。要说明一点这等事，我们是应该讲讲闺秀们本身，以及她们的社会之类，应该用活泼的辉煌的彩色，画出所谓她们的精神的特色来的：然而这在作者，却很难。一方面，是他在高官显宦的太太之前，怀着无限量的尊崇和敬畏的，而别方面……是的，别方面呢……就不过是难得很。却说N市的闺秀们……不，这不能，实在的，我怕。——在N市的闺秀们，什么是最值得注意的呢……不，奇怪得很，笔不肯动，它好像是一块铅块了。那么，也好：只好把描写她们的性格的事，让给在他的调色版上，比我更有鲜明灿烂的彩色的精粹的别人去；我们却单说一两句她们的外观，大体的表面就够。N市的闺秀们是原有阔绰之称的，这一点，所有的妇女们可真足取为模范。关于什么正当的举动，什么美善的调子，礼节，以及态度上的最微妙最幽婉的训戒，尤其是关于研究时式，连细微末节也不漏之处，她们实在比彼得堡和莫斯科的闺秀们要进几步。她们穿着富于趣味的衣饰，坐着漂亮的马车，在大街上经过：还依时式带一个家丁，身缀金色丝绦，在踏台上飘来飘去。一张名片，如果那名字是写在忒力夫二或是凯罗厄斯上面的，那就是神圣的物事。(8)有两位大家闺秀，以前本是很要好的朋友，也是堂姊妹，就为了这样的一张名片彼此完全闹开——其中之一，没有去回看别一个。她们的丈夫和亲戚后来用尽心力，想她们从新和睦，却枉然——世界上的无论什么事，都该可以做成了，只有这一件可不成：使因为一面怠于回访，变成仇敌的两位闺秀从新和睦。于是这两位，用这市里的绅士淑女们的口气来说，就僵在“互加白眼”里了。关于这问题，有谁得了胜，就也会有许多非常动人的场面，那男人们往往为了他们的保护职务，演出极壮大，极勇侠的表现来。他们之间，决斗自然是没有的，因为大家都是文官；然而他们却彼此竭力来抉发别人的缺点，谁都知道，无论如何，这是比决斗厉害得远的。N市的闺秀们的风气，非常严紧，以高尚的愤怒，来对付一切过失和诱惑，如果给她们知道一种弱点，就判决得极严。如果她们一伙里，自己有了什么所谓这个那个的事呢，却玩得非常之秘密，谁也觉不出究竟有了什么事。体面总不会损。就是那男人，即使自己觉得了，或者听到了这个那个的事，也早有把握，会引了谚语，简而得要的回答道：“我所不知，我就不管。”这里还该叙述的是N市的闺秀们也如她们那彼得堡的同行一样，在言语和表白上，总是十分留心，而且努力于正当的语调的。没有人听到过她们说：“我擤鼻涕！”“我出汗。”“我吐口水。”她们却换上了这样的话：“我清了一下鼻子。”或则“我用了我的手巾。”无论如何，也总不能说：“这杯子或盘子臭。”不能的，连觉得有些这意思的影子的话也不能说，要挑选一句，这样的表现来替代它：“这杯子不成样子呵。”或者别的这一类话。因为要使俄国话更加高尚，就把所有言语的几乎一半，都从会话里逐出了，人就只好常常到法国话里去找逃路。这就成了完全两样的事情。用起法国话来，则即使比上面所述的还要厉害的词句，也全不算什么事。关于N市的闺秀们，就表面上说起来，大略如此。自然，倘使再看得深一点，那就又有完全不同的东西出现的：然而深察妇人的心，危险得很。我还是只以表面为度，再往前去罢。这以前，闺秀们是不大提起乞乞科夫的，虽然对于他那愉快的，体面的交际态度，也自然十分觉得。然而自从他的百万富翁的风传，散布了以来，注意可也移到他另外的性质上去了。这并不是我们的闺秀们利己，或是贪财，罪恶只在百万富翁那一句话——不是百万富翁本身，只是那句话；因为这句话的发音中，除暗示着钱袋之外，也还含有一点东西，对于坏人，对于好人，对于非坏非好人，都给以强有力的印象；一言以蔽之，就是没有一个人不受它的影响的。百万富翁有一种便当之处，他能够特别观察那并非出于打算和谋划的非利己的卑屈，纯粹的卑屈：许多人知道得很清楚，他们不会从他这里有所得，也全不是向他有所求，然而偏要跑到他面前去，欣然微笑，摘下帽子，或者遇有百万富翁在场的午餐会，便去设法运动也来招待他自己。说这一种对于卑屈的倾向，也染上了闺秀们，那是不可以的。然而在许多客厅里，却确在开始议论起来，说乞乞科夫固不是美男子的标本，但总不失为一个体面人，假使他再胖上一点点，可就没有这么好看了。当这时候，对于瘦长男子，还来了几句近于侮辱的话：那不过是剔牙杖，不是人。闺秀们的打扮，也留心到各种的装饰了。匹头市场非常热闹，挤也挤不开。简直是赛会。许多马车穿梭似的在跑。有几匹布，是从市集贩来，因为价钱贵，至今不能卖掉的，这回却变成繁销，飞一般的脱手，使商人们也看得莫名其妙。当弥撒之际，看见闺秀们中有一位在衣服下面曳着拖裙，那裙圈胖得很大，至于把整个教堂占领，在场的警察便只好命令人民让出地方，都退到大门口去，以免损害太太的衣服。连乞乞科夫，终于也不得不被对他的异常的注意，引起一点惊异了。大好天气的一天，他回到家里来，看见写字桌上有一封信。发信的是那里，送来的是谁，全都无从明白：侍者说，送信人不许他说出发信人是谁来。信的开头非常直截爽快，就是这样的句子：“不行，我非写信给你不可了！”以下说的是灵魂之间，实有神秘的交感，因为要使这真理格外显得有力，就用上许多点和横线，快要占到半行。再下去接续着几句金言，那确凿，真给人很深的意义，我们几乎负有引在这里的义务的。“什么是人生？——是流寓忧愁的山谷，什么是世界？——是无所感觉的人堆。”发信人于是说到为了去世已经二十五年的弱母，她眼泪滴湿了花笺；并且劝乞乞科夫从此离开拘束精神，闭塞呼吸的都会，跟她到荒野去；一到信的末尾，竟涌出确实的绝望来，用这几行做了结束：

两匹斑鸠儿

载君到坟头，

彼辈鸣且歌

示君吾深忧。

末一行其实不很顺当，然而不要紧：信是完全合于当时的精神的。下面不署名，没有本名和姓自然也没有月日和年份。只在附启里，写着乞乞科夫自己的心，会猜出发信的人来，而明天知事家里的跳舞会，这古怪脚色是也要到会的。

一切都很有意思。匿名里面，含有很多的刺戟和诱惑，很多，至于引起了好奇心，使乞乞科夫再拿这信来看了两三遍。终于叫了起来道：“这可是很有意思，如果查出了究竟谁是发信的人！”总而言之，事情确是分明的起了转变了，他把一个钟头以上的工夫，化在奇特的揣摩推测里。于是做一个放开不问的姿势，低下头去，喃喃自语道：“但这信有点非常之故意做作！”以后是不说也知道，很小心的叠好信纸，放在提箱里，和一张戏园广告，以及在那地方已经躺了七年，没有动过的一张婚礼请帖，做了邻居了。这时可真的送进一张知事家里的跳舞会的请帖来。在省会里，这是有点很普通的：什么地方有知事，就也得有跳舞会，要不然，阔人们是很容易欠缺相当的爱戴和尊敬的。

他立刻放下一切，不再看作一回事，抽出身子，专门去做跳舞会的准备去了；因为这件事实在有许多挑逗和刺戟。即使创造世界，恐怕也用不着化在装饰上的那么多的心力和工夫。单是对着镜子，检阅和修炼自己的脸，就要一点钟。他使自己的脸上显出一大串各种不同的表现：照见忽而正经和威严，忽而含着微笑的恭敬，忽而又是不含那种微笑的恭敬；于是对镜鞠几个躬，一面吐着含含胡胡的，颇像法国话的声音，虽然乞乞科夫也并不懂得法国话。之后他又装了一通极其讨人欢喜的惊愕，扬眉毛，牵嘴唇，连舌头也活动了一两次；你敬爱的上帝呵，如果人独自在那里，又觉得自己是一个美丈夫，并且确信没有人在钥匙洞里张望的时候，有什么还会做不出来呢。临末他还轻轻的自己摸一摸下巴，说道：“唉，唉，你这好家伙！”于是动手穿起衣服来。他始终觉得很高兴：一面套裤带，打领结，一面却在装着胡乱的行礼，优雅的鞠躬，并且跳了一下，虽然他从来没有学过跳舞。但这一跳，可出了无伤大雅的结果：柜子发抖。刷子从桌上掉了下来了。

他在会上的出现，引起了非常特别的情形。所有在场的人，都连忙来迎接他，一个还捏纸牌在手里，别一个是正在谈天，到了紧要之处，刚说出“您想，地方法官就回答道……”地方法官究竟怎么回答呢，他却不再讲下去，直奔我们的主角，去和他打招呼了：“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”“阿，我的天，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”“亲爱的保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”“可敬的保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，心肝！”“您来啦吗，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”“他来了哩，我们的保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”“您给我拥抱一下罢，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”“这里来，给我诚心的接吻一下，我的宝贵的保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”乞乞科夫觉得，他几乎同时被许多人所拥抱了。他还没有从审判厅长的拥抱里脱出，警察局长就已经把他围在他的臂膊里，警察局长又把他交给卫生监督，监督交给烧酒专卖局长，烧酒专卖局长交给建筑技师……那知事，这时正和一对闺秀们站在一起，一只手拿一张糖果的包纸，别一只手抱一匹波罗革那的小狗，一看见乞乞科夫，就把两样——包纸和小狗——都抛在地板上，至于使小狗大声的嗥起来……总而言之，来客是散布着快活和高兴的。并未愉快得发光的脸，或者并未反映一点一般的高兴的脸，竟一个也没有。官们的脸，在他们的上司前来检阅下属的政绩之际，就这样的发光：这时最初的恐怖消散了，还觉得很得些上司的赞许，竟至于和气的露出一点小小的玩笑来，那就是说几句话，带着愉快的微笑——于是围着他的，跟着他的官们，就高兴的加倍的笑起来了，连话也不大听到，不大明白的官们，也一样的高兴的笑起来了，是的，连远远的一直站在门口，一生从来没有笑过，只给百姓看他拳头的警察——也遵照了反射和模拟的永久不变的定律，在他脸上现出微笑来，不过那微笑，却很有些像他嗅了一种强烈的鼻烟，现在刚刚要打嚏。我们的主角和大家招呼，又给各人回答，自己觉得非常的纯熟：他向右边弯腰，又向左边弯腰，虽然因为习惯，不免略有一点歪，然而不碍事，还是倾倒了所有在场的人物。闺秀们立刻像绚烂的花环似的来围住他，把他罩在各种香气的云雾里：这一个发着玫瑰味，那一个带来紫罗兰和春天的气息，第三个是涌出强烈的木犀草的芳香。乞乞科夫只是昂起鼻子，吸进香气去。她们的装饰上，也展布着无穷的趣味；所有羽纱，缎子和网绸的颜色，全是最时式的轻淡和褪光的，那细微的差别，单是说说名目也就不容易——这地方的文化和趣味，是已经达到这样的高超和精细了。飘带，结子和花束，以如画的纷乱，在衣服上飞动，虽然这纷乱，是由许多不纷乱的头脑，费过不少的时光。头上的轻装只搁在耳朵上，仿佛想要说：“且住！我要飞去了！只可惜不能带了我的美人一同去！”她们都穿着很紧窄的衫子，看起来就显出挺拔和合适的丰姿。（我应该趁这机会声明，N市的闺秀们是都见得有点儿胖胖的，但她们知道很巧妙的收束起来，于是成了很适宜的姿态，人也不觉得她们的肥大了。）一切都经过深思熟虑：颈子和肩膀露出得刚刚合适，不太少，可也不太多：谁都照了自己的感觉和确信，显示着她的东西，来要一个男人的命；其余的部份，就用了很大的鉴识和意趣，遮盖起来：或者用一种飘带做成的，比叫作“接吻”的点心还要轻飘飘的围巾，淡烟似的绕在颈子上，或者在背后的衣服下面，衬一条我们乡下大抵称为“卫道”的细麻所做的小小的花纱。这花纱是前前后后，遮到决不使男子再会送命的程度的，然而这正是害事之处的嫌疑，却也就在这里。长手套并不紧接着袖口，显出肘弯以上的臂膊的动人的一段来，有许多还丰满得令人羡慕；有一些人，因为拉得太高，竟把羔皮手套撕破了——总而言之，好像一切东西，都想要说：“不不，这不是乡下，这是巴黎！”不过有时也突然现出一顶谁也一向没有见过的包帽，或者跳出一枝孔雀毛，或者反对时髦的别的什么和一种只顾自己的趣味的表示来。然而没有这些是不行的——这就是省会的特征：总要露一点这样的破绽。乞乞科夫站在闺秀们的面前，心里想：“但究竟谁是发信人呢？”他试在一刹时中，伸出他的鼻子去；却碰着了肘弯，翻领，袖口，飘带，香喷喷的小衫和衣服的一大阵。粗野的迦落巴特(9)发狂似的在他眼前奔了过去：邮政局长夫人，地方审判厅长，插蓝毛毛的太太，插白毛毛的太太，乔具亚的公爵咭卜卡咭哩全夫，彼得堡来的一个官，莫斯科来的一个官，法国人咕咕，沛尔勖诺夫斯基先生和沛来本陀夫斯基先生——都忽然当面在地球上出现，在那里奔腾奋迅了。

“我们这里是——全省都在活动了哩！”乞乞科夫后退着，一面自己说。但当闺秀们散开的时候，他却又重行察看，看他可能从颜面和眼睛的表示上，辨出寄信的人来；然而，颜面和眼睛都不告诉他，寄信人是那一个。各到各处，每张脸上都漂泛着一点依稀的可疑，无限的微妙——唉，多么微妙……！“不成，”乞乞科夫心里说，“女人……就是这样的物事。”——这时他做了一个示意的手势——“那简直是无话可说的！如果谁想把她们脸上闪过的一切这曲折和层叠，再来叙述一下，或者模拟一下罢……也简直办不到！单是她们的眼睛就是一个无边无际的国土，倘有人错走了进去，那就完了！钩也钩不回，风也刮不出，谁试来描写一下她们的眼神罢：这温润，绵软，蜜甜的眼神……谁知道这样的眼神有多少种呢：刚的和柔的，朦朦胧胧的，或者如几个人所说的‘酣畅的’眼神，而且还有并不酣，然而更加危险的——那就是简直抓住人心，好像用箭穿通了灵魂的一种。不成，找不出话来形容的！这是人类社会的‘寻开心的’一半，再没有别的了！”

唉唉，不对！我不料我们的主角竟滑出一句街坊上的话来。但叫我怎么办呢？这是在俄国的作家的运命！不过倘有一句街坊话混进这书里来，可不是作者之罪，倒是读者，尤其是上流的读者之罪：从他们那里，先就听不到合式的俄国话，他们用德国话，法国话，英国话和你应酬，多到令人情愿退避，连说话的样子也拼命的学来头，存本色：说法国话要用鼻音，或者发吼，说英国话呢，像一只鸟儿还不算到家，再得装出一副真像鸟儿的脸相，而且还要嗤笑那不会学这模样的人。他们所惟一竭力避忌的，是一切俄国话——至多，也不过在乡下造一座俄国式的别墅。这样的是上流的读者，以及一切自以为上流的读者！然而别一面却又有：那么的严厉，那么的要求！他们简直要最规矩，纯粹，高尚的文体来做文章——一句话，是要俄国话自己圆熟完备，从云端里掉了下来，正落在他们的舌头上，只要一张口，教跑出外面去就好了。人类社会的女性的一半，自然是很难猜测的；但我得声明，我觉得可敬的读者先生，却往往更其难于猜测。

这之间，乞乞科夫越加惶惑，不知道怎么从所有在场的闺秀里，认出发信人来了。他再来一种试验，用了研究的眼光，去观察她们中的每一个，觉得那些多情的女性的眼睛里，都闪烁着一点东西，是使可怜的凡骨的心中，收得希望和甘甜的痛楚，这使他终于喊起来道：“不行，还是枉然的，我看不出！”但这对于他始终如一的大高兴，却并无丝毫影响。还是用他那快活的，无拘无束的态度，和一两位闺秀谈几句趣话，开着又快又小的脚步，忽而走向这个，忽而走向那个，轻飘飘的绕着女人，转来转去，好像穿高底靴的老花花公子，即俄国一般叫作“耗子公马”的一样。如果他要迅速稳当的穿过一群人，就鞠一个躬，同时把脚儿伸出一点去，就是所谓螺旋势子或是花花公子画花押。闺秀们都很愉快而且满足，不但是从他这里发见了一大堆可取和有趣的特色了，还在他脸孔的表情上，看出了一点凡有女人们一定非常喜欢的，尊严的，勇敢的，威武的东西来。真的，为了他，人几乎要吵架了：许多人立刻觉到，乞乞科夫是大抵站在门口近旁的，大家就都要来坐靠近门口的椅子，有一位闺秀比别一位占了先，这时就几乎现出不舒服的局面，有许多自己也想去坐的人，对于这无耻和胡闹，都气愤得很。

乞乞科夫和闺秀们施展着活泼的谈天，其实倒是她们向他来施展着活泼的谈天，给了他许多非常微妙和优秀的比喻的话头，全都得加以想象和猜测，弄得他满头流汗，至于忘记了去尽礼节的义务：就是向这家的主妇问安。直到听见已经对他站了两三分钟的知事太太的声音，这才记得起来了。知事太太很亲密的摇着头，用了柔和的，又有些狡猾的音调，向他说话道：“阿，您来啦，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！……”我在这里，不能把知事太太的话完全再现，我只知道她说了几句非常友爱和亲热的句子，就是我们的最高雅的作家们常常写在小说和故事里的，名媛和侠士所说的那一类，他们是特别偏爱描写我们客厅里的生活，而且趁这机会，显出他们是精微的情景的大知识家来的。她说的大约是：“人已经这么利害的占领了您的心，里面竟没有一块小地方，没有一点小角落，剩给您这么忍心忘却了的别人了吗？”我们的主角立刻转向知事太太去，而且已经想好了回答，那回答，比起我们从斯风斯基，林斯基，理定，格来明所写的时行小说里，以及从别的出场人物之类的军人们那里所听到的来，自然只会好，不会坏，但当他在无意中一抬眼的时候，却忽然遭了打击似的停止了。

知事太太站在他面前，然而并不止她自己：她还挽着一个十六七岁的年青的姑娘，鲜明的金色发，精致整齐的相貌，尖锐的下巴和卵圆的脸盘，实在可以给美术家去做画圣母的模范，在无论什么东西：山和树林，平野，脸，嘴唇和脚，都喜欢广大的俄国，是很不容易找出来的——当他走出罗士特来夫家的时候，当他的车子，因为车夫发昏或是马匹的碰巧的冲突，和她的马具缠绕起来的时候，当米卡衣叔和米念衣叔想来解开这纠纷的结子的时候，他在路上遇见的，就是这金色发。乞乞科夫非常狼狈了，至于嘴里再也说不出有条理的句子来，只吃吃的讲了一句痴呆的含胡话，无论是斯风斯基或林斯基，理定或格来明，都决不肯使他滑出口来的。

“您还没认识我的女儿罢？”知事太太说。“她是刚从文塾里毕业出来的。”

他回答说，他曾经出乎意外地和她有过相见的光荣：以后还想添上几句去，然而完全失败了。知事太太又说了一两句话，就和她的女儿走向大厅的那一头，去招呼另外的客人，乞乞科夫却还生根一般的站着。他在这地方还站了很久的工夫，恰如一个高高兴兴的到街上去散步的人，周围景象，无不浏览，却突然立住了，因为他想了起来，自己还忘记了什么；恐怕再没有比这样的人，更加不中用的了：只一击就从他脸上失去了无忧无愁的样子。他竭力的回想，自己究竟忘记了什么呢：手巾么？手巾就塞在衣袋里！他的钱？钱可是也在的！好像什么也没有缺，然而总有一个莫名其妙的妖魔，在耳朵边悄悄的告诉他忘记了什么。他只是胡胡涂涂的看着潮涌的人群，尾追的马车，兵们的枪和帽，店家的招牌之类，心里却并不明白。乞乞科夫也就是这模样，和周围的事情全不相关了。这之间，从女人的发香的口唇里，向他飞过许多柔腻的质问和暗示来。“我们这些可怜的地上居民可以斗胆的问您，您在沉思着什么吗？”——“您的思想所寄托的幸福的旷野，是在什么地方呢？”——“引您进这快活的瞑想之谷的那人的名字，我们可以知道吗？”然而他不再看重这些问题了，闺秀们的亲爱的言语，恰如说给了风的一样，是的，他竟这样的疏忽，至于放闺秀们静静的站着，自己却跑到大厅的那一边，去探知事太太和她女儿的踪迹去了。但闺秀们却并不肯这么轻易的就放手——各人都暗自下了坚固的决心，要用尽对于我们的心，非常危险的药味，要用尽她们的极顶强烈的撩人之力。我在这里应该夹叙一下，有几个闺秀——我说，有几个，决不是全体——是被一个小小的弱点所累的：如果她觉得自己有一点动人之处，无论前额也好，嘴也好，手也好，就以为这种特色，别人也应该立刻佩服，大家异口同声的喊道：“瞧，瞧，她有多么出色的希腊式的鼻子呀！”或者是“多么整齐的动人的前额呵！”如果有很美的肩膀呢，她首先就相信一切青年男子，都要给这肩膀所迷，她一走过，就无条件的叫起来道：“阿呀，她有多么出色的肩膀呀！”而对于脸孔，头发，眼睛和前额，却看也不看，即使看，也不过当作不关紧要的东西。闺秀们中的有几个，是在这样的想的。但这一晚上，却谁都立下誓愿，在跳舞之际，要竭力表现得动人，还把自己的最大美艳的特色，显得非常明白。邮政局长夫人在应着音响，跳着华勒支舞之间，把她俊俏的头，非常疲乏的侧了起来，令人觉得真的到了上界。一个非常可爱的闺秀，到会的目的，是完全不在跳舞的，用她自己的话来说，是在右脚的大趾上，有了鸡眼睛模样，豌豆儿大小的不舒服或是不便当，所以她只得穿了绒鞋——但竟也坐不住了，就穿着她的绒鞋跳了几回华勒支，为的是不过使邮政局长夫人不要太自鸣得意。

然而这些一切，对于乞乞科夫并无豫期的效验；他几乎不看闺秀们的脚步和身段，只是踮起脚尖，从大家的头上张望着可爱的金头发的所在；忽而又弯低一点，由肩膀和臂膊之间去找寻她；他到底找到她了，他看见她和母亲坐在一起，头上俨然的摇动着插在一种东方式包帽上的羽毛。他好像就要向这堡垒冲锋了。春色恼杀了他，还是有谁在背后推他呢？总之，他就不管一切阻碍，决然的冲过去：烧酒专卖局长被他在肋下一推，好容易才能用一条腿站住，总算幸而还没有因此撞倒一排人；邮政局长也向后一跳，吃惊的看定他，带着一点微妙的嘲笑，但乞乞科夫却一看也不看，他只为那带着长手套的远地里的金头发生着眼睛，满心全是飞过场上，直到那边的希望了。这时在别一角落上，已经有四对跳着玛兹尔加：靴后跟敲着地板，一个陆军里的大尉，用了肉体和精神，两手和两脚，显出他们梦里也没有做过的奇想的姿势来。乞乞科夫几乎踏着了跳舞者的脚，一直跑向知事太太和她的女儿所坐的地方去。然而，待到和她们一接近，他却非常胆怯，也不再开勇往直前的小步，竟简直有些窘急，在一切举动上，都显出仓皇失措来了。

在我们的主角那里，真的发生了一点所谓恋爱吗，不能断定；像他那样的人，或者是并不很胖，却也并不太瘦的人，竟会有恋爱的本领吗，也可疑得很；然而这里却演出了一点连他自己也讲不明白的奇特的情景：据他后来自己说，他觉得，仿佛全个跳舞会以及喧嚣和杂沓，在一刹时中，都退到很远的远方，提琴和喇叭，好像在山背后作响，一切全如被烟雾所笼罩，似乎草率地涂在一幅画布上面的平原。而在这朦胧地，草率地涂在画布上面的平原里，却独独锋利而分明的显着动人的年青的金头发的优美的丰姿：她那出色的卵形的脸盘，她那苗条的充实的体态，这是只在刚出女塾的女孩儿身上，才得看见的，还有她那近乎质朴的洁白的衣服，轻松的裹着娇柔的肢节，到处显出堂皇的精粹的曲线来。她好像一件象牙雕成的奇特美丽的小玩艺；在朦胧昏暗的群集里，惟独她灿然的见得雪白和分明。

这世界上，也会有这等事：乞乞科夫在他的一生中，虽然不过很短的一瞬息，但也成了一下子诗人了；不过诗人的名目，也还过份一点。至少，在这瞬间，他觉得自己像是一个少年人，或者一个时髦的骠骑兵了。那美人儿旁边恰有一把椅子是空的，他连忙坐下去。谈话开首有些不中肯，不久也就滔滔不绝，他而且得意了起来，然而……我应该在这里声明我的很大的惋惜，凡是身负重要的职务，上了年纪，有了品位的人，和闺秀们谈天，是有一点不大顺口的；说得很流畅的只有中尉，大尉以上的高级军官就全不行。他们在说什么呢，只有上帝知道：可总不是怎么高明的物事，但年青的姑娘们却笑得抖着肩膀；一个枢密顾问官倒也会对你们讲些极顶神妙的东西：说俄罗斯是—个强国，或者说句应酬话，自然并非没有精神的，不过全都很带着钞书的味道，倘若他说一点笑话，自己先就笑个不停，比听着的闺秀们还利害。我在这地方加了这样的声明，为的是要使读者明白，为什么在我们的主角谈话中间，我们的金头发竟打起呵欠来了。但我们的主角好像全没有觉得，仍旧不住的搬出他在各处已经用过许多回的所有出色的物事来，例如：在洵毕尔斯克省的梭夫伦·伊凡诺维支·培斯贝七尼那里，这时住着他的女儿亚兑拉大·梭夫伦诺夫娜和她那三个堂姊妹：马理亚·喀夫理罗夫娜，亚历山特拉·喀夫理罗夫娜和亚兑拉大·喀夫理罗夫娜；还有，在略山省的菲陀尔·菲陀罗维支·贝来克罗耶夫那里；在喷沙省的弗罗勒·华西理也维支·坡背陀诺斯尼和他的兄弟彼得·华西理也维支那里，这时住着他们的堂姊妹加德里娜·密哈罗夫娜和两个侄孙女：罗若·菲陀罗夫娜和爱密理亚·菲陀罗夫娜；最后是在伐忒卡省的彼得·华尔梭诺夫也维支那里，住着他的儿媳的姊妹贝拉该耶·雅戈罗夫娜和侄女苏非亚·罗斯谛斯拉夫娜和两个异父姊妹苏非亚·亚历山特罗夫娜和玛克拉土拉·亚历山特罗夫娜。

乞乞科夫的态度惹起了一切闺秀们的不平。其中的一个故意在他旁边经过，要他悟出这一点来，并且用她展开的裙裾，稍稍卤莽地扫着金头发，一面又整理着在她肩头飘动的围巾，那巾角就正拂在这年青闺秀的脸孔上；也在这时候，别一位闺秀便在乞乞科夫的背后，和从她那里洋溢出来的紫罗兰香一起，嘴里飞出了一句颇为恶毒的辛辣的言辞。然而无论他实在没有听见，或者不过装作不听见，他的举动在这地方却真的有些不合，因为闺秀们的意见是总该给点尊重的。他也后悔自己的过失，但可惜是在后来，已经到了太晚的时候了。

许多脸上都画出了应有的愤怒。纵使乞乞科夫的名声在交际场里有这么大，纵使谁都确信他拥有百万的家财，纵使他脸上带着威严的，英勇的神气——但有一件事，是闺秀们决不饶恕男人的，无论怎样，无论是谁，他一定完结。女人和男人比较起来，性格上原也较为没有力，但到有些时候，她却不但坚强不屈胜于男人，还胜于世界上的一切。乞乞科夫在无意中显了出来的藐视，使那因为椅子事件，几乎破裂的闺秀们复归于平和与一致了。在她们随便说说的不关紧要的言语中，就会突然发见恶毒尖利的嘲讽。完成了这不幸的，是又有一个少年人，做了一两节关于跳舞者的讥刺诗，在外省的跳舞会里，没有这事是几乎不收场的。这诗又立刻说是乞乞科夫之作了。愤怒越来越大，闺秀们聚集在大厅的各处角落上，彼此切切私语，还给他几句非常不好的指斥；可怜的金头发也被奚落得半文不值，宣告了她的死刑。

这之间，却有一个极顶恼人的袭击，等候着我们的主角；当他的年青的对手打着呵欠，他向她讲述古代各种的故事，说到希腊哲学家提阿改纳斯的时候，罗士特来夫却突然上台，就从客厅的一间后房里走出来了。他从休息室里来，还是从那打着大牌的绿色小屋里跳出来的呢，他的出现，是由于自愿，还是被人赶出来的呢，总之，他高兴地，非常快活地走进客厅里来了，还挽着检事，他确是已经被拖了好久了的，因为这可怜的检事皱着眉头，看来看去，大约是在设法来摆脱他那亲密的旅行的向导。而且他的境遇，实在也很难忍受的。罗士特来夫拖过两杯红茶——自然加了蔗酒的——来，一饮而尽；于是又是讲大话。乞乞科夫一在远处望见他，就决计牺牲了目前的佳遇，赶紧飞速的走开，因为这会面，是决不会有好事情的。但不幸的是身边竟忽然现出知事来，自说找到了保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，非常高兴，并且将他坚留，请他判断和两位闺秀之间的小小的辩论；因为关于妇女的爱之是否永久，大家的意见还不能相同；但这时候，罗士特来夫却已经看见，一径向他跑来了：

“阿，唷！赫尔生的地主！赫尔生的地主！”他叫喊着跑近来，一面哈哈大笑，笑得他那红如春日蔷薇的鲜活的面庞，只是抖个不住。“怎么样？你买了许多死人了吗？您要知道，大人！”于是转向知事那边，放开喉咙，喊道：“他在做死魂灵的买卖哩！真的，听罢，乞乞科夫！听哪，我是看交情才对你说的，在这里的我们，都是你的好朋友，大人也在这里，我要绞死你，真的，我要绞死你！”

乞乞科夫一点办法也没有了。

“您不相信我罢，大人！”罗士特来夫接着说。“他对我说的是：‘听哪，把您的死掉的魂灵卖给我罢。’我几乎要笑死了。待到我上了市镇，人们却告诉我说他因为要移住，买了三百万卢布的魂灵，了不得的移住呀！他到我这里就来买过死人的。听哪，乞乞科夫：你是一只猪，天在头上，你是一只猪！大人也在这里，对不对，检事先生？”

然而检事和乞乞科夫都非常失措，简直找不出答话来；罗士特来夫却有些快活起来了，不管别人，尽说着他的话：“哦，哦，我的乖乖……如果你不告诉我为什么要买死魂灵，我是不放开你的。听哪，乞乞科夫，你应该羞；你一定自己也明白，你没有比我再好的好朋友了。瞧罢，大人也在这里……对不对，检事先生？您不相信罢，大人，我们彼此有怎样的交情，实在的，如果您问我——我站在这里，如果您问我：‘罗士特来夫，从实招来，你的亲爷和乞乞科夫两个里，你爱谁呀！’那我就回答说：乞乞科夫！天在头上！……心肝，来呀，让我和你接一个吻，亲一个嘴。您也许可我和他接一个吻罢，大人。请你不要推却，乞乞科夫，让我在你那雪白的面庞上，亲一个嘴儿罢！”然而罗士特来夫和他的亲嘴来得很不像样，几乎是直奔过去的。大家都从他身边退开，也不再去听他了。不过他那买死魂灵的话，却是放开喉咙，喊了出来的，又带着响亮的笑声，所以连停在大厅的较远之处的客人们，也无不加以注意。这报告来得太兀突，使大家的脸上带着一半疑惑，一半胡涂的表情，一声不响的呆立起来。乞乞科夫并且看见许多闺秀们都在使着眼色，恶意的可憎的微笑着，在有几个的脸上，还看出一点非常古怪的东西和另有意思的东西来，于是更加狼狈了。罗士特来夫是一个说谎大家，那是谁都知道的，从他那里听些胡说八道，也是谁都不以为意的：然而尘世的凡人——唉唉，怎么这凡人竟会这样的呢，可实在很难解：一有极其昏妄，极其无聊的新闻，只要是新闻，他就无条件的散布到别一个凡人那里去，虽然也说：“又起了多么大的谣言了呵！”那别一个凡人就尖起耳朵，听得很高兴，后来固然也说道：“然而这是一个大谎，完全不必相信的！”于是连忙出外，去找第三个凡人，告诉他这故事，之后又因了义愤，同声叫喊道：“多么下贱的谎话呀！”而消息就这样的传遍了全市镇，所有在此的凡人们，多日谈论着这件事，一直到大家弄得厌倦，这才说，这故事是没有谈论的价值的。

这无聊之至的偶然的事故，使我们的主角很是心神不定了。一个呆子的很胡涂，很荒谬的话，也往往会使一个聪明人手足无措。他忽然觉得很不舒服，而且苦恼了，好像穿着擦得光亮的长靴，踏在龌龊的，发臭的水洼里；总而言之，这不漂亮，很不漂亮！他要竭力的不想它，忘掉它，疏散它。他还坐下去打牌，然而什么都不顺手，像一个弯曲的轮子：他错抓了两回别人的牌，有一回还至于忘记了并不该他打，却擎起手，打出自己的牌去了。这保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，是一个好手，并且还可以称为精细的赌客，怎么竟会犯这样的错误，而且连他自说是希望所寄，有如上帝的毕克王也打掉了的呢，审判厅长简直想不出缘故来。邮政局长，审判厅长，还有警察局长，自然也照例的和我们的主角打趣，说他一定在恋爱，而且他们知道，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支是怀着一颗发火的心的。谁使他的心受伤的呢，他们也很明白。然而这并不能给他慰安，虽然他也竭力的装出笑容，用玩笑来回答他们的玩笑。晚餐也没有使他快活起来。纵使席上非常适意，而且罗士特来夫也因为连闺秀们也说他胡闹，早已被人赶走了。当跳着珂蒂伦(10)时，他竟忽然坐在地板上，去抓跳舞者的衣裾，照闺秀们的口气说，这实在是大失体统的。晚餐吃得很愉快，在闪耀着三臂烛台，花朵，瓶子和装满点心的碟子之间的一切脸孔，都为了虚荣的欢喜和满足在发光。军官们，闺秀们和穿燕尾服的绅士们，谁都献着出格的殷勤。有一个大佐，竟用出鞘的刀尖，把汤碟子挑到他的闺秀的前面。有了年纪的绅士们，连乞乞科夫也在内，则在热心的讨论，一面嚼着硬煮食品的鱼或肉，尽量的撒上胡椒末，一面吐出确切的言语来；人们所争论的，正是乞乞科夫向来很有趣味的对象，但这一晚上，他却像一个从远道归来，疲乏困顿的人，脑子并不听他的指挥，他也没有参加的兴致。他竟等不及晚餐散席，大反了往常的习惯，一早就回到家里去了。

在读者已很熟悉的门口摆着柜子，角落上窥探着蟑螂的屋子里，他的精神和思想，也如他所坐的臬兀不安的靠椅一样，不大平静。他的心很沉闷。一种沉重的空虚在苦恼他：“鬼捉了玩出这跳舞会的那些东西去！”他愤愤的叫道。“他们为什么要这样的高兴？全省满是坏收成，物价腾贵和饥荒，他们却玩跳舞会！有什么好处：一大批娘儿们的旧货。奇怪的是她身上穿着一千卢布以上的东西。归根结蒂，还是农奴们拿他的租钱来付，结果也终于还是我们的。谁都知道，男人们为什么要这么敛钱，纳贿的呢：就是为了给他的女人买很贵的围巾，衣服，以及别的鬼知道叫作什么！这为的是什么呀？为的不过是使放荡的娘儿们可以说，邮政局长太太有一身好衣服哩——因此就抛掉一千卢布。于是嚷道：跳舞会，跳舞会，多么愉快呀！妈的这样的跳舞会，我看和俄罗斯精神是一点也不合的，这完全是一种非俄罗斯制度。呸，还有哩：像精赤条条的拔光了毛的魔鬼似的，忽然跳出一个上了年纪的黑燕尾服的汉子来，把腿摇来摇去。别一个又和另一个弄在一起，和他谈着正经事，一面却又在地板上左左右右，玩出古怪花样来……这都不过是猴子学样；猴子学样罢了。因为法国人是到了四十岁，还像十五六岁的孩子一样的，所以我们也得这么的来一下！哼，真的，我觉得每一个跳舞会之后，就总要弄出一件什么坏事情，连想也想不得！脑袋的空虚，就恰如和一个场面上的名人谈了天，他说的全是浮面，讲的都靠书本，听起来原也很漂亮，有味的，然而听着的人的脑袋，还是先前似的一无所得；其实倒不如和一个简单的商人去谈天，他只知道自己的本行，然而知道得透彻，切实，比起所有这些小摆设来，更要有价值。究竟从这样的跳舞会里能弄出什么来呢？不知道可有一个作家，想照式照样，写出一切情形来的没有？即使做了书，那跳舞会本身，却还是荒谬胡涂之至的。不知道这究竟有什么影响：道德的，还是不道德的呢？究竟怎样，鬼才知道。人就只要吐一口唾沫，抛掉书！”对于跳舞会，乞乞科夫大概说得这么不合意；但我相信，他的不满，是另外还有一个原因的。招他憎恨的，其实全不是跳舞会，倒是那情状，当大众之前，忽然来了一道莫名其妙的光，于是他就扮演了很奇特，很暧昧的脚色了。自然，如果他用了明白人的眼睛来看这事故，他是会觉得一切都是小事情，一句呆话也毫无关系的，尤其是在要事已经幸而办妥了的现在。但是——人却有一点稀奇：使他很恼怒的正是失掉了这人的寄托，虽然对于这寄托，他自己并不看重，评的极苛，还为了他们的尚浮华和爱装饰下过很锋利的攻击。待到经过充足的历练，知道他自己也该负一点罪，那就更加恼怒了。纵使他毫不气忿自己，而且当然还是不错的。可惜我们谁都有这一个小小的弱点，就是总要爱护自己，却去找一个邻近的东西，来泄自己的恼怒，或者用人，或者恰巧碰到的下属，或者自己的女人，或者简直是一把椅子，我们就把它摔到门口或者鬼知道的什么地方去，碰下它一条腿，或是一个靠手来，给看看我们绅士之流的恼怒。

乞乞科夫也立刻找到一个邻近，应该将自己的恼怒，全都归他负担的来了。这亲爱的邻近就是罗士特来夫，不消说，他就上上下下，四面八方的拼命的痛骂了一通，恰如偷儿的对于村长，车夫的对于旅客，对于远行的大尉，看情形也对于将军的一样，在许多古典的咒骂上，另外再加上一大批新鲜的，由他自己的发明精神而来的东西。罗士特来夫的整部家谱被拉出来了，他家族里的许多列祖列宗，都遭了利害的玩弄。

但当乞乞科夫为阴郁的思想所苦恼，一睡不睡的坐在他那坚硬的靠椅里，痛责着罗士特来夫和他的全家的时候，当烛光渐渐低微，烛心焦了一大段，脂烛随时怕会熄灭的时候，当窗外的漆黑的暗夜，已由熹微的晨光，转成莽苍苍的曙色的时候，当远处已有一二鸡鸣，在睡着的市镇的街道上，悄悄的走着一个只知道一条（可惜只是一条）不可拘束的俄罗斯人民所走的道路的，穿着简单的呢外套的莫辨地位和出身的不幸人的时候——在市镇的那一头，使我们主角的苦恼的地位更加为难的戏剧，却已经在开幕了。这时候，在远处的大街和小巷里，轧轧的走着一件非常奇特的东西，一下子很难叫出名目，既不像客车，也不像篷车，可又不像半篷车，倒仿佛一个胖面颊，大肚子的西瓜，搁在一对轮子上。这西瓜的面颊，就是车门，还剩有黄颜色的痕迹，但是很不容易关，因为闩和锁都不行了，只用几条绳勉强的缚住。西瓜里面，塞满着纱枕头，有像烟袋的，有圆的，也有和普通枕头一样的，还有袋子，装着谷物，白面包，小麦面包，捏粉的咸饼干。上面还露着一只填王瓜的鸡和王瓜馅的包子。马夫台上站着一个人，家丁模样，身穿杂色的手织麻布的背心。他不刮脸，头发是已经花白起来了。这是常见的人物，在我们那里的乡下，普通都叫作“小子”的。这铁轮皮和锈螺钉的喧闹惊醒了街的那一头的巡丁，抓起钺斧，在睡眼惺忪中放声大叫道：谁呀？待到他觉得并没有人，不过是猛烈的车轮声在远处作响，便伸手在领子上捉住一个小动物，走近街灯去，就在那地方亲手用指甲执行了死刑。于是又放下钺斧，遵照着他的武士品级的规矩，仍旧熟睡了。马匹的前蹄时时打着失，因为没有钉着马掌，而且也分明因为它们还没有熟悉这幽静的市镇的街道。这辆车又转过几个弯，从一条街弯进别一条去，终于通过圣尼古拉区教堂旁边的昏暗的小巷，停在住持太太的门口了。从车子里爬出一个姑娘来，头戴包帕，身穿背心，捏起两个拳头，像男人似的使劲的捶门。（那杂色麻布背心的小子，是因为他睡得像死尸一样，后来被拉着脚，从他的位置上拖开了。）狗儿嗥了起来。接着也开了门，好容易总算吞进了这不像样的车辆。车子拉到堆着柴木，搭着许多鸡棚和别的堆房的狭小的前园里；才从车子里又走出一位太太来；这就是女地主十等官夫人科罗皤契加。我们的主角一走，这位老太太就非常着急，怕自己遭了他的诓骗，在三夜不能睡觉之后，终于决了心，虽然马匹还未钉好马掌，也一定亲赴市镇，去探听一下死魂灵是什么时价，而且她这么便宜的卖掉了，是否归结是上了一个大当。她的到来，会发生什么结果呢，读者从两位闺秀的谈天里，立刻可以知道了。这谈天……但这谈天，还不如记在下一章里罢。

笫九章


有一天早晨，还在N市的访客时间之前，从一家蓝柱子，黄楼房的大门里，飘出一位穿着豪华的花条衣服的闺秀来了，前面是一个家丁，身穿缀有许多领子的外套，头戴围着金色锦绦的亮晃晃的圆帽。那闺秀急急忙忙的跳下了阶沿，立刻坐进那停在门口的马车里。家丁就赶紧关好车门，跳上踏台，向车夫喝了一声“走”。这位闺秀，是刚刚知道了一件新闻，正要去告诉别人，急得打熬不住。她时时向窗外探望，看到路不过走了一半，就非常之懊恼。她觉得所有房屋，都比平时长了一些，那小窗门的白石造成的救济所，也简直显得无穷无尽，终于使她不禁叫了起来道：“这该死的屋子，就总是不会完结的！”车夫也已经受了两回的命令，要他赶快：“再快些，再快些，安特留式加！你今天真是赶的慢得要命！”到底是到了目的地了。车子停在一家深灰色的木造平房的前面，窗上是白色的雕花，外罩高高的木格子；一道狭窄的板墙围住了全家，里面是几株细瘦的树木，蒙着道路上的尘埃，因此就见得雪白。窗里面有一两个花瓶，一只鹦鹉，用嘴咬着干子，在向笼外窥探，还有两只叭儿狗，正在晒太阳。在这屋子里，就住着刚才到来的那位闺秀的好朋友。对于这两位闺秀，作者该怎样地称呼，又不受人们的照例的斥责，却委实是一件大难事。找一个随便什么姓罢——危险得很。纵使他选用了怎样的姓——但在我们这偌大的国度里的那里的角落上，总一定会有姓着这姓的人，他就要真的生气，把作者看成死对头，说他曾经为了探访，暗暗的来旅行，他究竟是何等样人，他穿着怎样的皮外套散步，他和什么亚格拉菲娜·伊凡诺夫娜太太有往来，以及他爱吃的东西是什么；如果认出他的官位和头衔来——那你就更加危险了。上帝保佑保佑！现在的时候，在我们这里，对于官阶和出身，都很神经过敏了，一看见印在书上，就立刻当作人身攻击：现在就成了这样的风气。你只要一说：在什么市镇上，有一个傻家伙——那就是人身攻击，一转眼间，便会跳出一位一表非凡的绅士来，向人叫喊道：“我也是一个人，可是我也是傻的吗？”总而言之，他总立刻以为说着他自己。为豫防一切这种不愉快的未然之患起见，我们就用N市全部几乎都在这么称呼她的名目，来叫这招待来客的闺秀罢，那就是：通体漂亮的太太。她的得到这名目，是正当的，因为她只要能够显得极漂亮，极可爱，就什么东西都不可惜，虽然从她那可爱里，自然也时时露出一点女性的狡猾和聪明，在她的许多愉快的言语中，有时也藏着极可怕的芒刺！对于用了什么方法，想挤进上流来的人物，先不要用话去伤她的心。但这一切，是穿着一套外省所特有的细心大度的形式的衣裳的。她的一举一动，都很有意思，喜欢抒情诗，而且也懂得，还把头做梦似的歪在肩膀上，一言以蔽之，谁都觉得她确是一位通体漂亮的太太。至于刚才来访的那一位闺秀，性格就没有那么复杂和能干了，所以我们就只叫她也还漂亮的太太罢。她的到来，惊醒了在窗台上晒太阳的叭儿狗：简直埋在自己的毛里面了的狮毛的阿兑来和四条腿特别细长的雄狗坡忒浦儿丽。两匹都卷起尾巴，活泼的嗥着冲到前厅里，那刚到的闺秀正在这里脱掉她的外套，显出最新式样，摩登颜色的衣服和一条绕着颈子的长蛇(1)。一种浓重的素馨花香，散满了一屋子。通体漂亮的太太一知道也还漂亮的太太的来到，就也跑进前厅里来了。两位女朋友握手，接吻，呼喊，恰如两个刚在女塾毕业的年青女孩儿，当她们的母亲还没有告诉她这一个的父亲，比别一个的父亲穷，也不是那么的大官之前，重行遇见了的一样。她们的接吻就有这么响，至于使两匹叭儿狗又嗥起来，因此遭了手帕的很重的一下——那两位闺秀当然是走进淡蓝的客厅里，其中有一张沙发，一顶卵圆形的桌子，以及几张窗幔，边上绣着藤萝；狮毛的阿兑来和长脚的胖大坡忒浦儿丽，也就哼着跟她们跑进屋子里。“这里来，这里来，到这角落上来呀！”主妇说，一面请客人坐在沙发的一角上。“这才是了，这才对了！您还有一个靠枕在这里呢！”和这句话同时，又在她背后塞进一个绣得很好的垫子去；绣的是一向绣在十字布上的照例的骑士；他的鼻子很像一道楼梯，嘴唇是方的。“我多么高兴呵，一知道您……我听到有谁来了，就自己想，谁会来的这么早呢？派拉沙说恐怕是副知事的太太罢，我还告诉她哩：这蠢才又要来使我讨厌了吗？我已经想回复了……”

那一位闺秀正要说起事情，摊出她的新闻来，然而一声喊，这是恰在这时候，从通体漂亮的太太那里发出来的，就把谈话完全改变了。

“多么出色的，鲜明的细布料子啊！”通体漂亮的太太喊道，她一面注意的检查着也还漂亮的太太的衣服。

“是呀，很鲜明，灵动的料子！但是普拉斯科夫耶·菲陀罗夫娜说，如果那斜方格子再小些，点子不是肉桂色的，倒是亮蓝色的，就见得更加出色了。我给我的妹子买去了一件料子；可真好！我简直说不上来！您想想就是，全是顶细顶细的条纹，在亮蓝的底子上，细到不过才可以看得出，条纹之间可都是圈儿和点儿，圈儿和点儿……一句话，真好！几乎不妨说，在这世界上是还没有什么更好看的。”

“您知道，亲爱的，这可显得太花色了。”

“阿呀，不的！并不花色！”

“唉唉，真是！太花色的利害！”

我应该在这里声明，这位通体漂亮的太太，是有些近乎唯物论者的，很倾于否认和怀疑，把这人生的很多事物都否定了。

但这时也还漂亮的太太却解说着这并不算太花色，而且大声的说道：“阿呀，真的，幸而人们没有再用折叠衣边的了！”

“为什么不用的？”

“现在不用那个，改了花边了！”

“阿唷，花边可不好看！”

“那里，人们都只用花边了，什么也赶不上花边，披肩用花边，袖口用花边，头上用花边，下面用花边，一句话，到处花边。”

“这可不行，苏菲耶·伊凡诺夫娜，花边是不好看的！”

“但是，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，好看呀，真是出色的很，人们是这么裁缝的：先叠两叠，叠出一条阔缝来，上面……可是您等一等，我就要说给您听了，您会听得出惊，并且说……真的，您看奇不奇：衫子现在是长得多了，正面尖一点，前面的鲸须撑的很开；裙子的周围是收紧的，像古时候的圆裙一样，后面还塞上一点东西，就简直à la belle femme(2)了。”

“不行，您知道，这撑的太开了！这可是我要说的！”通体漂亮的太太喊了起来，还昂着头一摇，傲然的觉得自己很严正。

“一点不错，这撑的太开了，我也要这么说！”也还漂亮的太太回答道。

“那倒不，敬爱的，您爱怎么着，就怎么着罢，我可不跟着办！”

“我也不……如果知道什么都不过是时行……什么也都要完的！我向我的妹子讨了一个纸样，只是开开玩笑的，您知道。家里的眉兰涅，可已经在做起来了。”

“什么，您有纸样吗？”通体漂亮的太太又喊了起来，显出她心里分明很活动。

“自然。我的妹子送了来的！”

“心肝，您给我罢，谢谢您！”

“可惜，我已经答应了普拉斯科夫耶·伊凡诺夫娜的了。等她用过之后？”

“什么普拉斯科夫耶·伊凡诺夫娜穿过之后，谁还要穿呀？如果您不给自己最亲近的朋友，倒先去给了一个外人，我看您实在特别得很！”

“但她是我的叔婆呀！”

“阿唷，那是怎样的叔婆？不过从您的男人那边排起来，她才是您的亲戚……不，苏菲耶·伊凡诺夫娜，我不要听这宗话——您安心要给我下不去，您已经讨厌我，您想不再和我打交道了……”

可怜的苏菲耶·伊凡诺夫娜竟弄得完全手足无措。她很知道，自己是在猛火里面烧。这只为了夸口！她想用针来刺自己的胡涂的舌头。

“可是，我们的花花公子怎么了呢？”这时通体漂亮的太太又接着说。

“阿呀，真的，真的呀。我和您坐了这么一大片工夫。一个出色的故事！您知道么，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，我给您带了怎样的新闻来了？”这时她才透过气来，言语的奔流，从舌头上涌出，好像鹰群被疾风所驱，要赶快飞上前去的一样。在这地位上说话，是她的极要好的女朋友也属于人情之外的强硬和苛酷的了。

“您称赞他，捧得他上天就是，随您的便，”她非常活泼的说，“可是我告诉您——就是当他的面，我也要说的，他是一个没有价值的人；没有价值的，没有价值的人！”

“对啦，但是您听着罢，我有事情通知您！”

“人家都说他好看，可是一点也不好看，一点也不——他的鼻子——他就生着一个讨厌的鼻子。”

“但是您让我，您让我告诉您，心肝，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，您让我来说呀。这真是好一个故事，我告诉您，一个‘Ss’konapell istoar'(3)的故事。”那女朋友显着完全绝望的神情，并且用了恳求的声音说。——当这时候，写出两位闺秀用了许多外国字，并且在她们的会话里夹进长长的法国话语去，大约也并非过份的。然而作者对于为了我们祖国的利益，爱护着法国话的事，虽然怀着非常的敬畏，对于我们的上等人为了祖国之爱和它的统一，整天用着这种话的美俗，虽然非常之尊敬，却总不能自勉，把一句外国话里的句子，运进这纯粹的俄罗斯诗篇里面去，所以我们也还是用俄国话写下去罢。

“怎样的一个故事呢？”

“唉唉，我的亲爱的安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，您可知道我现在是怎样的一个心情呀！您想想看，今天，住持夫人，那住持的太太，那希理耳神甫的太太，到我这里来了；哪，您想是怎么样？我们这文弱的白面书生！您早知道的，那新来的客人，您看他怎么样？”

“怎的？他已经爱上了住持太太了吗？”

“那里那里！安娜·格力戈利也夫娜！要是这样，还不算很坏哩！不是的，您听着就是，那住持太太对我怎么说！‘您想想看，’她说，‘女地主科罗皤契加忽然闯到我这里来了，青得像一个死人，还对我说，哦，她对我说什么，您简直不会相信。您听着就是，她对我说的是什么！这简直是小说呀！在半夜里，全家都睡觉了，她忽然听到一个怪声音，这可怕是说也没有法子说，使尽劲道的在敲门，她还听到人声音在叫喊：开门！开门！要不，我就捣毁了……’唔，您以为怎么样？您看我们的花花公子竟怎么样？”

“哦，那么，那科罗皤契加年青，漂亮吗？”

“唉唉，那里！一个老家伙！”

“这倒是一个出色的故事！那么他是爱弄老的？哪，我们的太太们的脾气也真好，人可以说。一下子就着了迷了。”

“这倒并不是的，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜！和您所想象的，完全是另一回事。您想想看，他忽然站在她面前了，连牙齿也武装着，就是一个力那勒陀·力那勒提尼(4)，并且对她吆喝道：‘把魂灵卖给我，那些死掉了的。’他说。科罗皤契加自然是回答得很有理：‘我不能卖给您；他们是已经死掉的了。’——‘不，’他喊道，‘他们没有死。知道他们死没有死，这是我的事，’他说，‘他们是没有死的，没有死的！’他叫喊着。‘他们是没有死的！’总而言之，他闹了一个大乱子，全村都逃了，孩子哭喊起来，大家嚷叫着，谁也不明白谁，一句话，不得了，不得了，不得了！您简直不能知道，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，当我听了这些一切的时候，我有多么害怕。‘亲爱的太太，’我的玛式加对我说，‘您去照一照镜子罢！您发了青了！’‘唉唉，现在照什么镜，’我说，‘我得赶快上安娜·格力戈利也夫娜那里去，去告诉她哩。’我立刻叫套车。我的车夫安特留式加问我要到什么地方去，我却说不出一句话儿来，只是白痴似的看着他的脸。我相信，他一定以为我发了疯了。唉唉，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，如果您能够知道一点我怎么兴奋呵！”

“哼！真是奇怪得很！”通体漂亮的太太说。“死魂灵，究竟是什么意思呢？我老实说，这故事我可是一点也不懂，简直一点也不懂。我听说死魂灵，现在已经是第二回了。我的男人说，这是罗士特来夫撒谎！但一定还有什么藏在里面的！”

“不不，您就单替我设身处地的来想一想罢，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，当我听了的时候，我是怎样的心情呵！‘现在呢，’科罗皤契加说，‘我全不知道应该怎么着了！他硬逼我在什么假契据上署名，’她说，‘并且把一张十五卢布的钞票抛在桌子上。我，’她说，‘是一个不通世故的，无依无靠的寡妇，这事情什么也不明白。’就是这样的一个故事呀！阿唷，如果您能够知道一点我怎么的兴奋呵。”

“不不，您要说什么，说您的就是！这并不是为了死魂灵呀！有一点完全别样的东西藏在这里面的。”

“老实说，我也早就这么想的。”也还漂亮的太太说，有一点吃惊。她又立刻非常焦急，要知道究竟藏着什么了，于是漫然的问道：“但从您看来，那里面藏些什么呢？”

“但是，您怎么想呀？”

“我怎么想？……老实说，我好像在猜谜。”

“但我要知道，您究竟是什么意见呢？”

然而，也还漂亮的太太却什么也想不出，所以就不开口。对于事物，她只会兴奋，至于仔细的想象和综合，却并不是她的事，因此她比别人更极需要细腻的朋友，给她忠告和帮忙。

“那就是了，我来告诉您，这死魂灵是有什么意思的。”通体漂亮的太太说，她的女朋友就倾听，而且还尖着耳朵；她的耳朵好像自己尖起来了。她抬起身，几乎要离开了沙发，她虽然有点茁实的，但好像忽然瘦下，轻如羽毛，看来只要有一阵微风，便可以把她吹去似的了。

一样情形的是俄国的贵公子，他是一个爱养狗，爱打猎，也爱游荡的人，当他跑近森林时，从中正跳出一只追得半死的兔子，于是策马扬鞭，赶紧换上弹药，接着就要开火。他的眼睛看穿了昏沉的空气，决不再放松一点这可怜的小动物。纵使当面是雪花旋舞的广野，用了成束的银星，射着嘴巴和眼睛，胡须，眉毛和值钱的獭皮帽，他也还是不住的只管追。

“死魂灵是……”通体漂亮的太太说。

“怎样？什么？”那女朋友很兴奋的夹着追问道。

“死魂灵是……！”

“阿唷，您说呀，看上帝面上！”

“不过一种虚构，也无非是一个假托。其实是为了这件事：他想诱拐知事的女儿。”

这结论实在很出意料之外，而且无论从那一点来看，也都觉得离奇。也还漂亮的太太一听到，就化石似的坐在她的位置上；她失了色，青得像一个死人，这回可真的兴奋了。“阿呀，我的上帝！”她叫起来，还把两手一拍。“这是我梦也没有做到的！”

“我还得说，您刚刚开口，我就已经知道，那为的是什么了。”通体漂亮的太太回答道。

“这一来，那么，对于女塾的教育，人们会怎么说呢？这可爱的天真烂漫的！”

“好个天真烂漫！我听过她讲话了！我就没有这勇气，敢说出这样的话来。”

“您知道，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，现在的风俗坏到这地步，可真的教人伤心呀。”

“然而先生们还都迷着她哩。我可以说，我是看不出她一点好处来。……她做作得可怕，简直做作得教人受不住。”

“唉唉，亲爱的安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，她冷得像一座石像，脸上什么表情也没有。”

“不不，她多么做作，多么做作得可怕，我的上帝，多么做作呵！她从谁学来的呢？不过我从来没有见过一个女孩子，有这么装腔作势的脾气的。”

“亲爱的，她是一个石像，苍白的像死尸。”

“唉唉，请您不要这么说罢，苏菲耶·伊凡诺夫娜，她是搽胭脂的，红到不要脸。”

“不的，您说什么呀，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜；她白的像石灰一样，简直像石灰。”

“我的亲爱的，我可是就坐在她旁边的呢，她面庞上搽着胭脂，真有一个指头那么厚，像墙上的石灰似的一片一片的掉下来。这是她的母亲教她的。母亲原就是一个精制过的骚货，但女儿可是赛过母亲了。”

“不不，请您原谅，不不，您只说您自己的，我可以打赌，只要她用着一点点，一星星，或者不过一丝一毫的红颜色，我就什么都输出来，我的男人，我的孩子，所有我的田产和家财！”

“阿呀，您竟在说些什么呀，苏菲耶·伊凡诺夫娜。”通体漂亮的太太把两手一拍，说。

“那里，您多么奇特呵！真的我只好看看您，出惊了！”也还漂亮的太太也把两手一拍，说。

两位闺秀对于几乎同时看见的，简直不能一致，读者是不必诧异的。在这世界上，实在有很多东西，带着这种稀奇的性质；一位闺秀看作雪白，别一位闺秀却看作通红，红到像越橘一样。

“那么，再给您一个证据罢，她是苍白的。”也还漂亮的太太接着说。“我还记得非常清楚，好像就在今天一样，我坐在玛尼罗夫的旁边，对他说道：‘您看哪，她多么苍白呵！’真的，倘要受她的迷，我们的先生们还得再胡涂一点呢。还有我们的花花公子先生……我的上帝，这时候，他多么使我讨厌呵！您是简直想象不来的，他多么使我讨厌呵！”

“但有几位太太，对于他可也并非毫无意思的。”

“您说我吗，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜？这您可不能这么说。没有的事，没有的事！”

“我可并不是说您，世界上也还有别的女人的呀！”

“没有的事，没有的事，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜。请您允许我通知一句，我是很明白我自己的；这和我不相干；但别的太太们，那些装作难以亲近的样子的，却难说。”

“那里的话，对不起，请您给我说一句，我可一向没有闹过这样的丑故事。别人会这样也说不定，然而不是我，这是您应该许可我通知您的。”

“您为什么这么发恼呢？您之外，也还有别的太太们在那里的，她们争先恐后的去占靠门的椅子，为的是好坐得和他近一点。”

人也许想，也还漂亮的太太一说这些话，接着一定要有一阵大雷雨了；但奇怪的是两位闺秀都突然不说话，豫期的风暴并没有来。通体漂亮的太太恰巧记得了新衣服的纸样还没有在她的手中，也还漂亮的太太也知道还没有从她最好的朋友听过新发见的底细，因此这么快的就又恢复了和平。况且这两位闺秀们，不能说她天性上就有散布不乐的欲望，性情原也并不坏，不过当彼此谈天的时候，总是自然而然的，不知不觉的愿意给对手轻轻的吃一刀；那两人中的一人，间或因此得点小高兴，而这女朋友，有时是会说很亲昵的话语的：“这是你的！拿了吃去罢！”男性和女性，心里的欲望就如此的各式各样。

“我只还有一件事想不通，”也还漂亮的太太说，“那乞乞科夫，他不过是经过这里，怎么能决定一件这样骇人的举动来呢。他总该有一个什么帮手的。”

“您以为他是没有的吗？”

“您看怎么样，谁能够帮他呀？”

“是啰，譬如——罗士特来夫！”

“您真的相信——罗士特来夫？”

“怎么不？他什么都会做的。您莫非不知道，他还想卖掉他的亲爷，或者说的正确一点，是拿来做赌本哩。”

“我的上帝，我从您这里得了多么有趣的新闻呵！罗士特来夫也夹在这故事里，我真的想也想不到。”

“我可是马上就想到了！”

“这真教人觉得世界上无所不有！您说罢，当乞乞科夫初到我们这市镇里来的时候，谁料得到他会闹这样的大乱子的呢？唉唉，安娜·格力戈利也夫娜，如果您知道我怎样的兴奋呵！倘使我没有您，没有您的友情和您的好意……我真要像站在深坑边上一样……我得向那里去呢？我的玛式加凝视着我，觉得我白的像死人，对我说道：‘亲爱的太太，您白的像一个死人了！’我还告诉她说：‘唉唉，玛式加，我现在想的却完全是别的事情呢！’真的，就是这样！而且罗士特来夫也伏在那里面！好一个出色的故事！”

也还漂亮的太太很焦急，要知道关于诱拐的详情，就是日期，时间，以及别的种种，然而她渴望的太多了。通体漂亮的太太不过极简单的声明，她一点都不知道。况且她是从来不撒谎的：一种大胆的推测——那是另外一件事，但这也只以那推测根据于甚深的内心的确信为限；真的一有这内心的确信，这闺秀可也就挺身而出，那么，即使有最伟大的律师，且是著名的辩才和异论的征服者，去和她论争一下试试罢：这时候，他这才明白：内心的确信是怎样的东西了。

这两位闺秀们把先前仅是推测的事情，后来都成为确信，那是毫不足怪的。我们这些人，简洁的说，就是我们，我们称之为聪明的人们，那办法就完全一样，我们的学者的讨论，就是最好的证据。一位学者，对于事物，首先是像真的扒手一样，非常小心，而且近乎胆怯的来开手的，他提出一个极谦和稳健的问题：“此国之得名，是否自地球上之某处而来？”或是“此种记载，能或传于后世，将来否！”或是“吾等不应解此民众为如何如何之民众乎？”于是他立刻引据了古代的作家，只要发见一点什么暗示，或者只是他算作暗示的暗示，他就开起快步来了，勇气也有了，随便和古代的作家谈起天来，向他们提出质问去，接着又自己来回答，把他那由谦虚稳健的推测开手的事一下子完全忘记了；这时他已经好像一切都在目前，非常明白，以这样的话，来结束他的观察道：“而是乃如此。此民众应作如此解。此乃根据，应借以判别此对象者也！”于是俨然的在讲座上宣扬，给大家都听得见——而新的真理就到世界上去游行，以赢得新的附和者和赞叹者。

当我们的两位闺秀用了许多锐利的感觉，把这么错杂纠缠的事件，顺顺当当的解释清楚了的时候，那检事，却和他的永久不动的脸孔，浓密的眉毛和着的眼睛，走进客厅里来了。两位闺秀便马上报告他一切的新闻，讲述购买死魂灵，讲述乞乞科夫诱拐知事小姐的目的，而且讲的这么长，一直弄到他莫名其妙。他迷惑似的永是站在老地方，着左眼睛，用一块手帕揩掉胡子上面的鼻烟，听到的话却还是一句也不懂。当这时机，闺秀们便放下他不管，跑了出去，各奔自己的前程，到市里去发生骚扰去了。这计画，不过半点多钟就给她们做到。市镇由最内部开始，什么都显了很野的激昂，一下子就没有人还知道别的事。闺秀们是善于制造这种烟雾的，使所有的人，尤其是官员，都几乎茫然自失。她们的地位，开初就像一个中学生，用纸片卷了鼻烟，就是我们这里叫作“骠骑兵”的，探进睡着的同窗的鼻孔里面去。那睡着的人呼吸有些不通畅了，一面却以打鼾的全力，吸进鼻烟去，醒了，跳了起来，瞪着眼睛，看来看去，像一个傻子，却不明白他在什么地方，出了什么事；但接着又觉到了射在墙上的太阳的微光，躲在屋角里的同窗的笑声，穿窗而入的曙色，已经清醒的森林，数千鸟声的和鸣，在朝阳下发闪，在芦苇间曲折流行的小河，那明晃晃的波中，有无数稀湿的儿童在嬉游，叫人去洗操——这时他才觉得，他鼻子里原来藏着骠骑兵。我们的市镇里的居民和官员的景况，开初就完全是这样的。谁都小羊似的呆站着，而且瞪着眼睛。死魂灵，知事的女儿和乞乞科夫；这一切都纠缠起来，在他们的脑袋里稀奇古怪的起伏和旋转；待到最先的迷惘收了场，他们这才来区别种种的事物，将这一个和那一个分开，要求着清账，但到他们觉得关于这事件简直不能明白的时候，他们就发恼了。“这算是什么比喻，哼，真的，死魂灵是什么昏话呢？这故事和死魂灵，有什么逻辑关系呢？那么，人怎么会买死魂灵？那里会有这样的驴子来做这等事？他用什么呆钱来买死魂灵？他拿这死魂灵究竟有什么用？况且：知事的女儿和这事件又有什么相干？如果他真要诱拐她，为什么他就得要死魂灵？如果他要买死魂灵，又何必去诱拐知事的女儿？莫非他要把死魂灵来送知事的女儿吗？市里流传着怎样的一种胡说白道呵！多么不像样：人还来不及回头看一看，这胡涂话就已经说给别人了……如果这事件还有一点什么意义呢！……但别一面也许有什么藏在那里面，否则也不会生出这种流言来。总该有什么缘故的。但死魂灵能是缘故的吗？什么混账缘故也不是。这实在就像‘一个木雕的马掌’，‘一双煮软的长靴’或是‘一只玻璃的义足’一样！”总而言之，凡是说话，闲谈，私语，以及全市里所讲述的，都不外乎死魂灵和知事的女儿，乞乞科夫和死魂灵，知事的女儿和乞乞科夫，一切东西，全都动弹起来了。好像一阵旋风，吹过了沉睡至今的市镇。所有的懒人和隐士，向来是终年穿着睡衣，伏在火炉背后，忽而归罪于靴匠，说把他的长靴做得太小了，忽而归罪于成衣匠或者他的喝醉的车夫的，却也都从他们的巢穴里爬了出来，连那些久已和他的朋友断绝关系，只还和两位地主熊皮氏先生和负炉氏先生相往来的人们（两个很出名的姓氏，是从“躺在熊皮上”和“背靠着炉后面”的话制成，在我们这里很爱说，恰如成语里的“去访打鼾氏先生和黑甜氏先生”一样，那两人是无论侧卧，仰卧，以及什么位置的卧法，都能死一般的熟睡，从鼻子里发出大鼾，小鼾，以及一切附属的声音来的）；连那些请吃五百卢布的鱼羹和三四尺长的鲟鳇鱼，还有只能想象的入口即化的馒头，也一向不能诱他离家的人们，也统统出现了；一言以蔽之，好像是这市镇显得人口增多，幅员加广，到处是令人心满意足的活泼的交际模样。居然泛起一位希梭以·巴孚努且维支先生和一位麦唐纳·凯尔洛维支先生来了，这是先前毫没有听到过的；忽然在客厅里现出一个一臂受过弹伤的长条子，一个真的巨人来了，这大块头，是一向没有看见过的。街上是只见些有盖的马车，大洪水以前的板车，嘎嘎的叫的箱车，轰轰的响的四轮车——乱七八糟。在别的时候和别的景况之下，这流言恐怕绝不会被注意，但N市久已没有了新闻。从最近的三个月以来，在都会里几乎等于没有所谓谈柄，而这在都市里，是谁都知道，那重要不下于按时输送粮食的。忽然间，这市镇的居民分为代表两种完全不同的意见的，两个完全相反的党派了：男的和女的。男人们的意见胡涂之至；他们只着重于死魂灵。女党则专管知事女儿的诱拐。这一党里——为闺秀们的名誉起见，说在这里——用心，秩序和思虑，都好得差远。这分明是因为女人的定命，原在成为贤妻，到处总在给好秩序操心的。在她们那里，一切就立刻获得一种确凿而生动的外观，显豁而切实的形状，无不明明白白，透彻而且清楚，好像一幅完工的钩勒分明的图画。现在这事情了然了，说是乞乞科夫原是早已爱上了那人的，说是她也到花园里在月下去相会，说是倘使没有乞乞科夫的前妻夹在这中间（怎么知道他已经结过婚的呢，谁也说不出），知事也早把他的女儿给乞乞科夫做老婆了，因为他有钱，像犹太人一样，说是那女人的心里还怀着绝望的爱，便写了一封很动人的信给知事，又说是乞乞科夫遭了她父母的坚决的拒绝，便决计来诱拐了。在许多人家里，这故事却又说得有点不同：乞乞科夫并没有老婆，但是一个精细切实的汉子，他要得那女儿，就先从母亲入手，和她有了一点秘密的事，这才说要娶她的女儿，母亲可是怕了起来，这是很容易犯罪，违背宗教的神圣的禁令的，便为后悔所苛责，一下子拒绝了，那时乞乞科夫才决了心，要把女儿诱拐。也还有一大批说明和修正，那流言传得愈广，一直侵入市边和小巷里，这些说明和修正也发生得愈多。在我们俄国，社会的下层，是也极喜欢上等人家的故事的，所以便是那样的小人家，也立刻来谈这丑闻，虽然毫不知道乞乞科夫，却还是马上造成新的流言和解释。这故事不断的加上兴味去，逐日具备些新鲜的和一定的形态，终于成为完全确切的事实，传到知事太太自己的耳朵里去了。知事太太是一家的母亲，是全市的第一个名媛，为了这故事，非常苦恼，况且她真的想也想不到，于是就大大的，也极正当的愤激了起来。可怜的金头发，是挨了一场十六七岁的女孩儿很难忍受的极不愉快的面谕。质问，指示，谴责，训戒和威吓的洪流，向这可怜的娃儿直注下来，弄得她流泪，呜咽，一句话也不懂；门丁是受了严厉的命令，无论怎样，也决不许再放进乞乞科夫来。

闺秀们彻底的干了一通这位知事太太，完成了她们的使命之后，便去拉男党，要他们站到自己这面来。她们说明，死魂灵的事情，不过是一种手段，因为要避去嫌疑，容易诱拐闺女，所以特地造出来的。男人们里的许多便转了向，加进闺秀们的党里去，虽然蒙了他们同志的指摘和非难，称之为罗袜英雄和娘儿衫子——这两个表号，谁都知道，对于男性是有着实在给他苦痛的意义的。

然而男人们纵使这么的武装起来，想顽强的来抵抗，他们这党里却总是缺少那些女党所特出的秩序和纪律。他们全都不中用，不切实，不合式，不调和，不正当；脑袋里满是混杂和纷乱，思想上是缠夹和胡涂——一言以蔽之，就是把男人的倒楣的本性，粗卤，拙笨，迟钝的本性，既不会齐家，又没有确信，不虔诚，又懒惰，被永是怀疑和顾忌恐怖所搅坏的本性，很确切的暴露出来了。据男人们说，诱拐一个知事的女儿，骠骑兵比文人还要擅长，乞乞科夫未必来做这种事，不要相信女人，她们统统是胡说白道的，女人就像一只有洞的袋子，装进什么去，也漏出什么来：那应该着眼的要点，是死魂灵，虽然只有鬼知道那是怎么一回事，但也确有什么很不好，很讨厌的东西藏在那里面的。为什么男人们会觉得藏着什么很不好，很讨厌的东西的呢——我们不久就知道。这时恰恰放出一个新的总督到省里来了——这分明就是使官员们陷于不安和激昂情状的事件：于是永远要有各种查考和叱责了，于是头要洗得干净，摆得规矩了，于是上司照例办给他的下属的一切的羹汤，大家就总得喝尽了。——“上帝呀！”官员们想，“只要他一知道市镇上传播着这样的流言，他就不会当作笑话，可真的要发怒的呵。”卫生监督忽然完全发了青，他把这解释的很可怕了，怕“死魂灵”这句话，也许暗示着近来生了时疫，却因为办理不得法，死在病院里和别地方的许多人，怕乞乞科夫到底是从总督衙门里派出来的一个官，先来这里暗暗的探访一下的。他把自己的忧虑告诉了审判厅长。审判厅长说不会有这等事，但自己也立刻发了青，因为起了这思想：然而，如果乞乞科夫所买的魂灵确是死的呢？他不但许可了买卖契约，还做了泼留希金的证人。万一传到总督的耳朵里去了呢，那可怎么办？他把自己的忧虑去通知别几个，别几个也都忽然发青了：这忧愁刹时散布开去，比黑死病传染得还快。谁都在自己身上找出了并未犯过的罪案。“死魂灵”这句话显着很广泛的意义，至于令人疑心到它也许指着新近埋掉两个人的那两件事了。那两件案子都了结的还不怎么久。第一件，是几个梭耳维且各特的商人们闹出来的，他们在市镇的定期市集上，做过生意之后，就和几个从乌斯德希梭里斯克来的熟识的商人们来一桌小吃。俄国式的小吃，但用德国式的手段：羼水烧酒，柠檬香糖热酒，药酒，以及别的种种。这小吃，自然照例以勇敢的混战收场。梭耳维且各特的先生们，把乌斯德希梭里斯克的先生们痛打了一顿，虽然这一面在胁肋上也挨着很利害的几下，肚子上又受了伤，证明着阵亡的战士的拳头，有多么非常之大。胜利者中的一个，就像我们的拳斗家的照例的说法，张扬了起来，这就是说，鼻子给打扁了，只剩着一节指头的那么一点点。商人们都认了罪，并且声明，他们也太开了小玩笑。不久，大家就都说，为了这命案，他们每人出了四张一百卢布的钞票；此外就全都不了然。但据研讯的结果，乌斯德希梭里斯克的商人们却都是被煤气闷死的了。于是他们也就算是这样的落了葬。别一件，出的还不久，那是这样子的：虱傲村的官家农奴连络了皤罗夫村的，以及打手村的官家农奴，好像把一位宪兵，原是陪审官资格，叫作特罗巴希金的，从地上消灭了。这位宪兵，就是陪审官特罗巴希金，非常随便，时常跑到他们的村里去，那情形几乎有疫病一般的可怕。但那原因，大约是在他有一点心肠软，对于村里的女人实在太热心。这案子也没有十分明白，虽然农夫们简直说，这宪兵爱闹的像一匹雄猫，他们逐了他不只一两回，有一回还只好精赤条条的从一家小屋子里赶出。为了他的心肠软，宪兵是当然要受严罚的，但别一方面，如果虱傲村和打手村的农奴真的和谋害有关，其专横却也不合道理，难以推诿。事情总是莫明其妙；人看见那宪兵倒在路上；他的制服或是他的长衫，像一堆破布，相貌也几乎分辨不清了。案件弄到衙门里，终于移在刑事法庭，经私下的豫先商量之后，就发出这样意思来：人们聚集，即成惊人之数，故农奴中之何人，应负杀害宪兵之罪，殊不可知，况在特罗巴希金一方面，已系死人，纵使胜诉，亦属无聊，但农奴们是还在活着的，所以从宽发落，当有大益，于是下了判决，陪审官特罗巴希金应自负其死亡之责，因为他对于虱傲村和打手村之农户，加以法外之压逼，而且是在夜间乘橇归家之际，突然中风身故的。这案子好像已经了结得很圆稳；但官员们却又忽而觉得，这所谓死魂灵者，又即和这事件有关。正值这时候，可又来了一些事，即使没有这些事，官员们已经够在困苦的地位的了，然而知事又收到了两封信。一封是通知，说据最近的密报，省中有人在造假钞票，用的是各种不同的姓名。所以应该立即施行严厉的查缉。别一封是邻省知事的关于漏网的强盗的通知，谓在贵省的绅士群中，倘忽见有可疑之人，既无旅行护照，又无别种正当之证明书，则应请即将此人逮捕。两封信惹起了全体的惶恐；所有先前的豫料和推测，忽然都毫无用处了。这里面，关于乞乞科夫模样的话，自然是一句也没有的。但大家各自回想起来，却谁也不很明白乞乞科夫究竟是什么人，他自己也不过很含混，很游移的发表过他的身世，他单是说，他生平经历过大难，因为他想给真理服役，所以只得惹起目前的猜疑。然而这些话还是太朦胧，太含混。而且他又说，他有许多要他性命的敌人，那就更得想一想了：莫非他正有生命的危险，莫非他正在被穷追，莫非他正要开手做什么……那么，他究竟是何等样人呢？当他制造假钞票的人，或者竟是一个强盗，那自然是不能的——他有一副那么堂堂的相貌；但首先是：他实在是何等样人呢？到这时候，官员诸公这才起了开初就该发生的疑问，就是在这诗篇的第一章里，就该发生的疑问了。大家又决定到卖给他死魂灵的人们那里，去研究几件事，至少，是想知道那交易是怎样的情形，死魂灵究竟该作怎样的解释，以及乞乞科夫是否在偶然间，或者滑了口走漏过一点他的计画和目的，或者对他们讲过他是什么人。最先是到科罗皤契加那里去，但所得并不多：他用十五卢布买了死魂灵，也还要买鸟毛，哦，他还和她约定，竭力来买她另外的一切。他也把脂肪供给国家，所以他的确是骗子；因为先已有人买了她的鸟毛，而且把脂肪供给过国家。他什么利益都垄断，住持太太就给骗去足足一百卢布了。此外也探不出什么来；她说来说去，总只是这几句，于是官员们即刻明白，科罗皤契加简直不过是一个痴呆的老虔婆。玛尼罗夫声明：他敢担保保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，犹如担保自己一样。只要他能有保甫尔·伊凡诺维支那样出众的人格百分之一，他就极情愿放弃全部财产；一说到他，他大抵就细起了眼睛，还吐露了一点关于友情的思想。这思想，自然是尽够证明他温良的心术的；但对于这事件本身，他却并没有说明白。梭巴开维支回答道：由他看来，乞乞科夫是一个体面的人，他，梭巴开维支，只卖给了他最好的农奴，无论从那一点看，都是壮健活泼的人物；然而他自然不能担保将来就不会出什么事。倘使他们吃不起移住的辛苦，在路上死掉了，那就不是他的罪；这全在上帝的手中，世界上时疫和别的死症多得很，已经有过全村死尽的事实了。官员诸公又用了别一种方法来救自己的急，这实在不能说是高明的，然而也常常使用。他们曲曲折折，使相识的奴仆，去打听乞乞科夫的跟丁，看他们是否知道自己主人的过往经历和生活关系中的一点什么节目。然而打听出来的也很少。从彼得尔希加，除了那一些住房的霉臭之外，他们毫无所得，绥里方也不过短短的说明道：“他先前是官，在税关上办事的。”这就是一切。这一流人，是有一种稀奇古怪的脾气的：如果直截的问他们什么事，他们就什么也说不出。他们不能在自己的脑袋里把这事连结起来，或者只是简单的说，他们不知道。但倘若问他们别的事，可就什么都搬出来了，只要你愿意，而且还讲的很详细，连你从来并不想听的。官员们所做的一切的调查，只使他们明白了一件事：乞乞科夫到底是什么人呢，他们实在不知道，但他一定总该是什么人。他们终于决定，关于这对象，要有一致的意见，至少是弄出一个切实的判断来，他们怎么办，他们取什么标准，他们该怎样调查，他是什么人，是政治的不可放过，应该逮捕监禁的人，还倒是一个能把他们自己当作政治的不可放过的脚色，加以逮捕监禁的人呢。为了这目的，大家就彼此约定，都到警察局长的家里去，读者也早经熟识，那全市的父母和恩人的家里去了。

第十章


大家都聚在读者已经知道他是全市的父母和恩人的警察局长的家里。在这地方，官员们这才得了一个机会，彼此看出他们的面颊，为了不断的愁苦和兴奋，都这么的瘦损了下来。实在，新总督的任命，还有极重要的公文，末后是可怕的愁苦——这些一切，都在他们的脸上留着分明的痕迹，连大家的燕尾服也宽大起来了。谁都显得可怜和困顿。审判厅长，卫生监督，检事，看去都瘦削而且发青，连一个叫作什么绥蒙·伊凡诺维支的，谁也不知道他姓什么，示指上戴一个金戒指，特别爱给太太们看的人，也居然瘦损了一点。自然，其中也有几个大胆无敌的勇士，没有恐怖，没有缺点，不失其心的镇定的，然而那数目少得很；唔，可以算数的其实也只有一个，就是邮政局长。只有他总是平静如常，毫无变化，当这样的时候也仍然说：“明白你的，你总督大人。你还得换许多地方，我在我的邮局里，却就要三十年了。”对于这话，别的官员们往往这样的回报他道：“你好运气，先生。”“司泼列辛·齐·德意支(1)，伊凡·安特来伊支。”“你的差使是送信——你只要把送到的信收下来，发出去；你至多也只能把你的邮局早关一点钟，于是向一个迟到的商人，为了过时的收信，讨一点东西，或者也许把一个不该寄送的小包，寄送了出去。在这样的情形之下，自然是能唱高调的。但是你到我们的位置上来试试看，这地方是天天有妖魔变了人样子出现，不断的要你在手里玩点把戏的。你自己完全不想要，他却塞到你手里来。你的晦气并不怎么大；你只有一个小儿子。我这里呢，上帝却实在很保佑着我的泼拉司科夫耶·菲陀罗夫娜，使她每年总送给我一个泼拉司科式加或是彼得鲁式加(2)。如果这样，你也就要唱别一种曲子了。”那些官员们这么说。至于不断的抗拒着妖魔，实际上是否办得到呢，这判断却不是作者的事了。在大家聚集起来的这我们的宗务会议上，分明有一种欠缺，就是民众的嘴里之所谓没有毛病的常识。要而言之，对于代议的集会，我们好像是生得不大惬当的。凡有我们的会议，从乡下的农人团体直到一切学术的和非学术的委员会，只要没有一个指挥者站在上面，就乱得一塌胡涂。怎么会这样的呢，很不容易说；好像我们的国民，是只在午膳或者小酌的集会上，例如德国式的大客厅和俱乐部的集会上，这才很有才能的。无论什么时候，对于任何东西，都很高兴。仿佛一帆风顺似的，我们会忽然设起慈善会，救济会，以及上帝知道是什么的别样的会来。目的是好的，但此后却一定什么事也没有。大约我们在开初，就是一早，已经觉得满足，相信这些事是全都做过的了。假如我们举一个要设立什么会，以慈善为目的，而且已经筹了许多款子的来做例子罢，为表扬我们的善举起见，我们就得摆设午宴，招待市里所有的阔人，至少化去现款的一半。那一半呢，是给委员们租一所装汽炉，带门房的阔宅子，于是全部款子，就只剩下五个半卢布来。而对于这一点款子的分配，会里的各委员也还不能一致，谁都要送给穷苦的伯母或婶娘。但这一次聚集起来的会议，却完全是别一种：逼人的必要，召集了在场人的。所议的也和穷人或第三者不相干，商量的事情，都关于各位官员自己；这是一样的威吓各人的危局，所以如果大家同心协力，正也毫不足怪。然而话虽如此，这会议也还是得了一个昏庸之极的收场。意见的不同和争论，是这样的会议上在所不免的，姑且不管它罢，但从各人的意见和议论中，却又表现了显著的优柔寡断：一个说，乞乞科夫是制造假钞票的，但又立刻接下去道：“然而也许并不是。”别一个又说，他许是总督府里的属员，接着却又来改正，说道：“不过，魔鬼才知道他是什么，人的脸上是不写着他是什么的呀。”说他是化装的强盗，却谁也不以为然，大家都倾服他诚实镇定的风姿，而在谈吐上，也没有会做这样的凶手的样子。许多工夫，总在深思熟虑的邮政局长，却忽然间——因为他发生了灵感，或是为了别样的原因——完全出人意外的叫起来了：“你们知道吗，我的先生们，他是什么人呀？”他的这话，是用一种带着震动的声音说出来的，使所有在场的人们，也都异口同声的叫起来道：“那么，什么人呢？”——“他不是别人，我的先生们，他，最可尊敬的先生，不会不是戈贝金(3)大尉！”大家立刻就问他：“那么，这戈贝金又是什么人呢？”邮政局长却诧异的回答道：“怎么，你们不知道，戈贝金大尉是什么人吗？”

大家都告诉他说，他们一向没有听到过一点关于这戈贝金大尉的事。

“这戈贝金大尉，”邮政局长说，于是开开鼻烟壶，但只开了一点点，因为他怕近旁的人，竟会伸下指头去，而那指头，他以为是未必干净的——他倒总是常常说：“知道了的，知道了的，我的好人，您要把您的指头伸到那里去！鼻烟——这东西，可是要小心，要干净的呀！”——“这戈贝金大尉，”他重复说，于是嗅一点鼻烟，“唔——总之，如果我对你们讲起他来——这是一个非常有意思的故事；对于一个作者，简直就是一篇完整的诗。”

所有在场的人们都表示了希望，要知道这故事，或者如邮政局长所说的这对于一个作者非常有意思的“诗”，于是他开始了下面那样的讲述：





戈贝金大尉的故事


“在一八一二年的出兵(4)之后，可敬的先生，”邮政局长说，虽然并不是只有一个先生，坐在房里的倒一共有六个，“在一八一二年的出兵之后，和别的伤兵一起，有一个大尉，名叫戈贝金的，也送到卫戍病院里来了。是一个粗心浮气的朋友，恶魔似的强横，凡世界上所有的事，他都做过，在过守卫本部，受过许多点钟的禁锢。在克拉司努伊(5)附近，或是在利俾瑟(6)之战罢，那不关紧要，总之是他在战争时候失去了一只臂膊和一条腿。您也知道，那时对于伤兵还没有什么设备：那废兵的年金，您也想得到，说起来，是一直到后来这才制定的。戈贝金大尉一看，他应该做事，可是您瞧，他只有一条臂膊，就是左边的那一条。他就到他父亲的家里去，但那父亲给他的回答是：‘我也还是不能养活你；我，’您想想就是，‘我自己就得十分辛苦，这才能够维持。’于是我的戈贝金大尉决定，您明白，可敬的先生，于是戈贝金决定，上圣彼得堡去，到该管机关那里，看他们可能给他一点小小的补助，他呢，说起来，是所谓牺牲了他的一生，而且流过血的……他坐着一辆货车或是公家的驿车，上首都去了，您瞧，可敬的先生，不消说，他吃尽辛苦，这才到了彼得堡。您自己想想看：现在是这人，就是戈贝金大尉，在彼得堡，就是在所谓世上无双的地方了！他的周围忽然光辉灿烂，所谓一片人生的广野，童话样的仙海拉宰台(7)的一种，您听明白了没有？您自己想想就是，他面前忽然的躺着这么一条涅夫斯基大街，或者这么一条豌豆街，或者，妈的，这么一条列退那耶街，这里的空中耸着这么的一座塔，那里又挂着几道桥，您知道，一点架子和柱子也没有，一句话，真正的什米拉米斯(8)。实在的，可敬的先生！他先在街上走了一转，为的是要租一间房子；然而对于他，什么都令人疑疑惑惑：所有这些窗幔，卷帘和所有鬼物事，您知道，就是地毯呀，真正波斯的，可敬的先生……一句话，说起来，就是所谓用脚踏着钱。人走过街上，鼻子远远的就觉得，千元钞票发着气味；您知道，我那戈贝金大尉的整个国立银行里，却只有五张蓝钞票和一两枚银角子……那么，您很知道，这是买不成一块田地的，也就是说，倘使再加上四万去，却也许买得到；然而有四万，人就先去租法国的王位了。好，他终于住在一个客店‘力伐耳市’里，每天一卢布，您知道，午餐两样，一碟菜汤加一片汤料肉……他看起来，他的钱是用不多久的。他就打听，他应该往那里去。‘你能到那里去呢，’人们对他说，‘长官都不在市里呀。您明白的，都在巴黎。军队还没有回来。但这里有一个叫作临时委员会的。您去试试看，’人们对他说，‘在那里您也许会得点什么结果的罢。’——‘那么，好，我就到委员会去，’戈贝金说，‘我要去告诉他们了。事情是如此这般的。我呢，说起来，是流了我的血，而且牺牲了我的一生的。’于是他，有一天的早晨，起来的早一点，用左手理一理胡子，于是，您瞧，他到理发店里去了，这是因为要显得新开张的意思，穿好他的制服，用木脚一拐一拐的走到委员会的上司那里去。您只要自己想想就是！他问，上司住在那里呢。人们告诉他说，海边上的那房子，就是他的。真是一所小屋子，您懂吗！玻璃窗，大镜子，大理石，磁漆，您只要自己想想就是，可敬的先生！一句话，令人头昏眼花。金属的门上的把手，是精致的好东西，好到人得先跑到店里去买两戈贝克肥皂，于是，就这么说罢，来洗一两点钟手，这才敢于去捏它。甬道前面呢，您瞧，站着一个拿大刀的门丁，一副伯爵相，麻布领子，干干净净的像一匹养得很好的布尔狗……我这戈贝金总算拖着他的木脚走进前厅去，坐在一个角落里，只因为恐怕那臂膊在亚美利加或是印度上，在镀金的磁瓶上，您很知道的，碰一下。您瞧，他自然应该等候许多工夫，因为他到这里的时候，那上司呢，说起来，还刚刚起床，当差的正给他搬进什么一个银的盆子去，您很知道，是洗脸用的。我的戈贝金一直等了四个钟头之久；当值的官员总算出来了，说道：‘长官就来！’这时屋子里早已充满了肩章和肩绶。一句话，人们拥挤得好像盘子里的豆子一样。到底，可敬的先生，长官进来了。哪，您自然自己想得到的：是长官自己呵。唔，自然，他的相貌就正和他的品级和官衔相称，这样的一副样子，您懂了没有？全是京派的谦虚。他先问这个，然后再问那个：‘您到这里贵干呀？’——‘那么，您呢？’——‘您有什么见教呢？’——‘您光降是为了什么事情呢？’临末也轮到了我的戈贝金：‘如此如此；这般这般，’他说，‘我流了我的血，一条腿和一只臂膊失掉了，说起来，我已经不能做事，请允许我问一声，我可不可以得一点小小的补助，什么一种安排，算是教养之用的小奖金或者恩饷呢，您是很知道的。’长官看见这人装着义足，右边的袖子也空空的挂着。‘就是了，’他说，‘请您过几天再来听信罢！’我的戈贝金真是高兴非凡。‘哪，’他想，‘事情成功了。’他是一条莽汉，您想想就知道的；简直在铺道上直跳。他到巴勒庚酒店去，喝烧酒，在‘伦敦’(9)吃中饭，叫了一碟炸排骨加胡椒花苞，再是一碟嫩鸡带各样的作料，还有一瓶葡萄酒——一句话，这是一餐豪贵的小吃，说起来。他在铺道上忽然看见来了一个英国女人。您知道，长长的，像天鹅一样。我的戈贝金，狂喜到血都发沸了，就下死劲的要用他的木脚跟着她跑，下死劲，下死劲，下死劲；‘唔，不行！’他想，‘且莫忙妈的什么娘儿们；慢慢的来，等我有了恩饷。我实在太荒唐了。’就在这一天，请注意呀，他几乎化掉了他的钱的一半。三四天之后，您瞧，他就又到委员会里去见长官：‘我来了，’他说：‘为的是等信，如此如此，这般这般，旧病和负伤的结果……说起来，我是流了我的血，您知道的。’说的都是官场话，那自然！‘是呀，是呀，’那长官说，‘但我先得通知您，您的事情，没有上司的决定，我可是没法办理的。您自己看就是，是怎么一个时候。战事是差不多，说起来，还没有完结。请您再熬一会儿，等到大臣们回来罢。您可以相信，不会忘记您的。如果您没法过活，就请您拿了这个去……这是已经尽了我所有的力量的……’哪，您知道，他给的自然并不多，不过用得省一点，也还可以将就到决定的日子。然而我的戈贝金不愿意这样子。他想，他是到明天就会有一两千的：‘这是你的，我的亲爱的，喝一下高兴高兴罢！’他现在却只好等候，而且等到不知什么时候为止了。他的脑袋里，您知道，是接二连三的出现着英国女人，肉汤和炸排骨。他就像一匹猫头鹰或者一只茸毛狗，给厨子泼了一身水，从长官那里跑出来——夹着尾巴，挂下了耳朵。在彼得堡的生活，他有些厌倦了，他也已经这样那样的尝了一下。现在是：瞧着罢，你以后怎么办，一切好东西都没有路道，您瞧。况且他还是一个活泼的年青人，胃口好，说起来，真像狼肚子。他怎么不常常走过什么一个饭店前面，现在您自己想想看，厨子是外国人，一个法兰西人，您知道，那么一副坦白的脸，总是只穿着很精致的荷兰小衫，还有一块围身，说起来，雪似的白。这家伙现在站在他的灶跟前，在给你们准备什么Finserb或是炸排骨加香菌，一句话，是很好的大菜，使我们的大尉馋的恨不得自己去吃一通。或者他走过米留丁的店门口：笑嘻嘻的迎着他的是一条熏鲑鱼，或者一篮子樱桃——每件五卢布，或者一大堆西瓜，简直是一辆公共汽车，您知道，都在窗子里，向外面找寻着衣袋里有些多余的百来块钱的呆子；您想想罢，一句话，每一步都是诱惑，真教人所谓嘴里流涎，然而对于他呢：请等一等。现在请您设身处地的来想一想：一面呢，您瞧，熏鱼和西瓜，别一面呢，是这么的—种苦小菜，那名目就叫作：‘明天再来。’‘哼，什么，’他想，‘不管他们要怎么样，我到委员会去，和所有的长官闹一场罢，我告诉他们：不行，多谢，这是不成的！’真的，他是强横的，不要面子的人——他一出搁楼，胆子就越大——于是他到委员会去了：‘唔，您要怎样呢？’人问他，‘您还要什么呢，您可是已经得了回信的了。’——‘我告诉您，’他说，‘我可是不能这么苦熬苦省。我得有我的炸排骨和一瓶法国的红酒吃中饭，还去看一回戏，高兴一下子，您知道。’他说。——‘那可不成，这是只好请您原谅我们的了，’这时长官就说……‘要这样子，您是应该忍耐的。您已经得了一点，可以敷衍到得到上头的决定，而且您也可以相信，您总会获得报酬，因为在我们这里，在俄国，如果有一个人，给他的祖国，说起来，是所谓尽了义务，对这样的人，置之不理，是还未有过先例的。但是，如果您现在就要随意的吃炸排骨，上戏园，您知道，那可只好请您原谅。只好请您自己去想法。只好请您自己办。’然而，您只要自己想一想就是，我的戈贝金屹然不动。这些话，像豌豆从墙上一样，都从他那里滚下去了。他大叫一声，给全体起了一个大乱子。他给所有的科长和秘书一阵真正的弹雨……‘好，你们这么说，那么说就是，’他说，‘好，你们可真不知道你们的义务和责任的，你们这些违法者！’一句话，他责骂他们了一通。别的衙门里的一个将军，也几乎遭殃。连这人也拉上了，您懂了没有？总之，他闹的乱七八糟。这么一个捣乱家伙，怎么办才好呢？长官看起来，除了用所谓严厉的办法来下场，也再没有别的路。‘好罢，’他说，‘如果您对于给您的东西还不满足，又不愿意在京里静候您的事情的决定，那么，我把您送回原籍去就是。叫野战猎兵来，送他回家去罢！’然而那野战猎兵，您很知道，却已经站着，等在门外面了：这么一个高大的家伙，您知道，简直好像天造他来跑腿的一样。一句话，是一个很好的拔牙钳。于是我们这上帝的忠仆就被装在马车里，由野战猎兵带走了。‘唔，’戈贝金想，‘我至少也省了盘缠钱。这一点，我倒要谢谢大人老爷们的。’他这么的走着，可敬的先生，和那野战猎兵，当他这样的坐在野战猎兵的旁边的时候，说起来，他在所谓对自己说：‘好，’他说，‘你告诉我，我只好自己办，自己想法子！好，可以，’他说，‘我就来想法子罢！’他怎样的被送到他一定的地方，就是他到底送到那里去了呢，什么也不知道。所以关于戈贝金大尉的消息，就沉在忘却的河流里面了，您知道，诗人之所谓莱多河(10)。但这地方，您瞧，我的先生们，在这地方，可以说，却打着我们的奇闻的结子的。戈贝金究竟那里去了呢，谁也不知道；然而您自己想想罢，不到两个月，略山的林子里就现出一群强盗来，而这群强盗的头领，您瞧，却并非别的……”

“可是对不起，伊凡·安特来也维支，”警察局长忽然打断他的话，“你自己说过，戈贝金大尉是失了一条腿和一只臂膊的；但乞乞科夫……”

于是邮政局长失声大叫起来，下死劲的在前额上捶了一下，还在一切听众之前，自称为笨牛。他全不明白为什么当这故事的开始，竟没有立刻想到这事情，而且承认了俗谚之所谓“俄罗斯人事后才聪明”，也实在是真话。但他又马上在搜索遁辞，想要洗刷了，他于是说，那些英国人，看报章就可以知道，机器是很完全的，有一个竟还发明了装着这么一种机关的木脚，只要在秘密的发条上一碰，那脚便会把人运到不知道什么地方去，再也寻不着了。

然而，大家虽然不相信乞乞科夫就是戈贝金大尉，也发见了邮政局长已经离题太远。但他们那一面却也不肯示弱，被邮政局长的玄妙的推测所刺戟，越迷越远了。在他们一流的许多优秀的臆想中，有一种尤其值得注意：这想的很奇特，以为乞乞科夫恐怕就是拿破仑化了装藏在他们的市里的；英国人久已嫉妒着俄国的力量和广大，早经常常表现于漫画上，画的是一个俄国人和一个英国人谈话：英国人站着，用麻绳牵着一只狗，这只狗可就是拿破仑的意思：“小心些，”那英国人说，“如果给我一点什么不合意，我就叫这狗来咬你。”谁知道呢，现在他们也许已经把这狗从圣海伦那(11)放出，装作乞乞科夫模样，到俄国各处来徘徊了，他其实却决不是乞乞科夫。

对于这臆测，官员们自然并不信仰，但他们想来想去，各人都静静的研究着这事情，却觉得乞乞科夫的侧脸，显然和拿破仑的似乎有些相像。警察局长曾经参加一八一二年的战事，见过拿破仑本人，也承认他的确并不比乞乞科夫高大，脸盘也不见得更瘦，可是别一面，又并不见得更肥。许多读者，也许以为这一切是非常不确的——哦，作者也极愿意跟着说，这故事非常不确；但没奈何的是确曾闹过我们在这里所说的事情，而这市镇并非荒僻之处，乃是邻近两大首都的地方，却也尤为奇特。这事即起于对法国人的光荣的战胜之后，是大家还应该记得的。当这时候，所有我们的地主，官僚，商人，掌柜，以及一切有教育的和无教育的人物，在最初的八年间，是都成了俗化的政治家的了。《莫斯科新报》和《祖国之子》被抢夺着看，至于到得末一个读者的手里，已经变成一团糟，不大看得出。没有这些问题了：您买这批燕麦是什么价钱呀，先生？——昨天的下雪，您以为怎样呢？——只听到问的是：哪，报上怎么说？——拿破仑没有跑掉吗？——而商人们尤其害怕，因为他们很相信一个三年前就下了监狱的前知者的豫言。这新的豫言者，忽然之间——没有人知道他是从那里来的——脚蹬草鞋，身披非常腥臭的光皮，在市上出现了，并且宣告说，拿破仑是反基督，现在系着石头的索子，困在七重墙和七个海后面，但他马上就要粉碎他的索子，来征服全世界了。这豫言者就为了他的豫言下了监狱，也为了法律。但却完成了他的传道，商人们因此很失掉一点理性。许久之后，即使有着赚钱的交易的时候，商人们也还跑到客店里去，在那里聚起来喝茶，谈着反基督。许多商人们和高尚的贵族，也不自禁的想着这件事，而且在那时支配了一切人心的神秘情调的潮流之下，相信从构成拿破仑这字的每个字母上，会发见一种特别的，大有道理的意义；有许多人竟还想从这里看出《默示录》的数目字来了。(12)所以即使官员们研究着这一点，实在也毫不足怪的。然而，他们也就立刻省悟过来，觉得他们的幻想太发达了，事情却全不是这么一回事。他们这么想，那么想，讨论来，讨论去，终于决定了去问一问罗士特来夫，倒也许并不坏。他是发表了死魂灵的故事的第一个人，而且据人们说，和乞乞科夫有很密切的关系，应该知道一点他的生活情形的；于是大家决定，先去听一听罗士特来夫怎么说。

这些官大人，真是古怪非常的人物，他们七颠八倒了：他们很知道罗士特来夫是一个撒谎家，说一句话，做一点事，都相信不得，但他们却到他那里去找自己的活路了！这里就知道人是怎样的！他不相信上帝，却相信把他的鼻子一抓，他就一定会死掉；对于由内心的调和和崇高的智慧所贯注，朗如日光的诗人的创作，他毫不放在心中，却很喜欢一个无耻之徒的产物，向他胡说一些乱七八糟，破坏自然的物事。这时他就张开嘴巴，高声大叫道：“瞧罢！这是纯粹的心声呀！”他一向轻蔑医生，后来却会跑到一个用祝赞和唾沫给人治病的老婆子那里去，或者简直自己用什么东西煎起汤药来，因为他忽然起了胡涂思想，以为这是可以治他毛病的了。官大人和他那困难的处境，大家自然是能够原谅的。人常常说，一个淹在水里的人会抓一条草梗，他已经来不及想，一条草梗至多也不过能站一匹苍蝇，却禁不起重有四五普特的他；然而如人所常说的那样，当这时候，他简直想不到这一点，就去抓那草梗了。我们的大人们，也就是这样子，终于向罗士特来夫身上去找活路。警察局长立刻写了一封信，请他到自己家里来吃夜饭，一个高长统靴，通红面庞的警官就匆匆的登程，用手捏住了他的指挥刀，跑到罗士特来夫那里去送信。罗士特来夫正在办一件极重要的事情，他已经四天不出屋子了，不见人，连中饭也从窗口递进去——一句话，他瘦得很，脸上也几乎发了青。这事情必须极大的注意和小心：是从六十副花样相同的纸牌里，选出一副纸牌来。但那花样必须极其分明，要像好朋友似的可以凭信。这样的工作，至少要化两礼拜工作。在这期间，坡尔菲里就得用一种特别的刷子给小猛狗刷肚脐，还用肥皂一天洗三次。他的独居受了搅扰，罗士特来夫很气恼，他先骂警官一声鬼，但到明白了警察局长当晚有一个小集会，席上还有什么一个新脚色的时候，他却立刻软下来了；他赶紧锁了门，很匆忙的穿好衣服，就到警察局长家里去。罗士特来夫的陈述，证明和推测，却和官大人的恰恰相反，把他们那些极其大胆的猜想，完全推翻了。他实在就是这样的一个人，简直没有含胡，也没有疑问；他们的推测愈游移，愈慎重，他的就愈坚固，愈确实。他毫不吞吞吐吐，立刻来回答一切的问题。他说，乞乞科夫买了一两千卢布的死魂灵，而他，罗士特来夫自己，也卖给他的，因为他毫不见有不该出卖的道理。对于他是否是一个侦探，到此嗅来嗅去的问题，罗士特来夫答道：他自然是一个侦探，大家同在学校里的时候，他就得了奸细的诨名，所有同学，自己也在内，还因此痛打了他一顿，至于后来单在太阳穴上，就得摆上二百四十条水蛭去(13)——他原想只说四十条的，但二百条却自己滑出来了。——对于他是否制造假钞票的问题，罗士特来夫答道，他自然制造。趁这机会，罗士特来夫还讲了一个乞乞科夫的出人意外的干练和敏捷的故事：他的家里藏着二万假钞票，给人知道了。于是封闭了屋子，路上站一个哨兵，门口站两个兵士；但乞乞科夫却在夜里把所有钞票掉换了一下，到第二天启封的时候，都是真的钞票了。关于这问题：乞乞科夫是否真有诱拐知事的女儿的目的，而他，罗士特来夫，是否也真在帮他的忙呢，那回答是：他的确在帮他，如果他不在内，事情是要全盘失败的。这时他却有些吞吞吐吐；他明知道这谎不得，而且很容易因此惹出麻烦来，但也禁不住自己的嘴。况且这也不是小事情，因为他的幻想，逼出了很有趣的详细事，想要完全消掉，实在也是一件难事了：他还说出拟去结婚的教堂所在的村子来；那就是德卢赫玛曲夫加村，牧师名叫齐陀尔长老，结婚费是二十五卢布，如果乞乞科夫不加以恐吓，说要告发他给面粉商人米哈罗和一个亲戚结了婚，教士是不肯答应的；而他，罗士特来夫，还借给他们自己的马车，准备着每一站就换马。他已经讲进很细微的节目去了，竟至于说出马夫的名字来。这时有人提起了拿破仑，然而只落得自己没趣，因为罗士特来夫所说的全是胡说白道，不但和真实全不相像，而且连联接也联接不起来的，于是使官员们到底只好站起身，叹着气走散；独有警察局长还注意的听了他许多工夫，想得到一点什么，然而他也终于装一个没有希望的姿势，只说道：“呸，见鬼！”所有在场的人全都明白，再来费力，实在也只等于试在公牛身上挤奶了。我们的官员的景况，于是比先前就更坏，决定了毫不能查出乞乞科夫是什么人。这里又分明的显出了人是怎样的物事：他处置别的人们的事情，是聪明，清楚，智慧的，但对于他自己却不行。只在你们陷于困难的境地时，他才有很切实，很周到的忠告！“多么精明的脚色呀！”大家叫喊道，“多么不屈的性格呀！”但只要使什么不幸来找一下这“精明的脚色”，使他自己进一回困难的境地罢——他的性格就立刻不会动！这不屈的人物毫无希望的站着，他变了可怜的乏人，柔弱的，啼哭的孩子，或者如罗士特来夫所爱说的说法，简直变成一个孱头东西了。

所有这些讲说，风闻和推测，不知为什么缘故，竟给了可怜的检事一个很大的印象。这印象很有力，至于使他回到家里，就沉思起来，而且就此沉思下去，在一个好天气的日子，竟忽然间，也说不出为什么，躺倒，死掉了。得了中风，还是因为什么别的呢，总之，他从椅子上跌下来，就长长的躺在地板上。一有这样的事，大家便照例的吓得失声，两手一拍，叫喊道：“阿呀上帝，阿呀上帝！”去邀医生来，给他放血，而终于决定了检事已经不过是一个没有魂灵的死尸。这时候，大家这才来怜惜死者实在有过一个魂灵，虽然因为他的谦虚，没有使人觉得。然而死的出现，在这里的可怕，是虽在一个渺小的人物，也正如伟大的闻人的：他，不久以前还是活着，动作，玩牌，竭力在种种文件上签字，常常和他那浓眉毛和鬼眼在官员们里逗留；他现在躺在台子上，左眼也不再了，惟独一只眉毛吊起了一点，使脸上显出一种奇特的，疑问的表情。浮在他嘴唇上面的，究竟是怎么一个问题呢？莫非他要知道他为什么而生，或者为什么而死——这只有上帝知道罢了。

“然而这可是不会有的，这是简直不近情理的！这怎么能呢，官员们竟会这么恐怖，这么胡涂，离真实到这么远，就是小孩子，也知道应该怎么办的呀！”许多读者会这样说，并且责备作者，说他做了荒唐无稽之谈，或者称那可怜的官员们为傻子，因为人是很爱用“傻子”这个字，每天总有二十来次，把这尊号抛在邻近的人们的头上的。人即使有十件聪明的性质，只要其中有一件胡涂，便要被称为傻子。读者坐在幽静的角落里，从自己的高处，俯视着广远的下方，就很容易断定人只知道近在鼻子跟前的物事，在世界史的编年录里，就有许多世纪，是简直可以抹杀，并且定为多余的。世界上的错误也真多，而且竟是现在连小孩子也许就知道免掉的错误。和天府的华贵相通的大道，分明就在目前，但人类的向往永久的真理的努力，却选了多么奇特的，蜿蜒的曲径，多么狭窄的，不毛的，难走的岔路呵。大道比一切路径更广阔，更堂皇，白昼为日光所照临，夜间有火焰的晃耀；常有天降聪明，指示着正路，而人类却从旁岔出，迷入阴惨的黑暗里面去。但他们这时也吓得倒退了，他们从新更加和正路离开，当作光明，而跑进幽隐荒凉的处所，眼前又笼罩了别一种昏暗的浓雾，并且跟着骗人的磷火，直到奔向深渊中，于是吃惊的问道：“桥梁在那里，出路在那里呢？”这些一切，使我们分明的知道了古往今来的人性。诧异那错误，嗤笑古人的胡涂，却没有看出这编年录乃是上天的火焰文字所书写，每个字母都宣示着真理，说所有书页上的警告的指头，就指着自己，指着我们现存的人性；然而现在的人性却在嗤笑着，骄傲着，他自己又在开始造出一批给后人一样的傲然微笑的错误来。

所有事情，乞乞科夫都不知道；仿佛故意似的，他这时恰巧受了一点寒，引起了腮帮子肿和轻微的喉痛，这样的毛病，许多我们的省会的气候，在居民之间是很适于蔓延的。要靠上帝保佑，他的生活并不就完，还有工夫愁他的子孙，他就决计躲在家里三四日。在这时候，他用牛乳漱口，里面浸一个无花果，漱过就喝掉，又把一个装着加密列草和樟脑的小袋子，贴在面颊上。因为散闷，他造起一个新买的农奴的详细的表册，还看看从箱子里找出来的一本讲拉瓦梨尔公爵夫人的什么书，又把提箱里的小纸片，小物事，都检查了一番，有许多还再读了一遍，一直到连这些也觉得无聊之至。没有一个这市的官员来问候他的健康，他简直不明白是什么道理，略略先前，是总有一辆车子停在他的门外的——忽而检事的，忽而邮政局长的，忽而审判厅长的。他不断的耸着肩膀，一面在屋子里走来走去。终于觉得好一点了，一到更加恢复，能去呼吸新鲜空气的时候，他非常高兴。他毫不迁延的就化装，打开箱子，玻璃杯里倒上一点温水，取了肥皂和刷子去刮脸，日子真也隔得长久了，因为手一摸着他的下巴，向镜子一照，他就叫起来道：“这简直是树林子呀！”而且实在的：即使并非树林子，也不失为种子在下巴和面颊上密密的抽了芽。他刮过脸，赶紧穿衣服，真的，他几乎是从裤子里跳出来的。到底穿好了；洒一点可伦香水，温暖的裹好了外套，走到街上去，还先用一条围巾小心的包住了面颊。他最初的出行——正如所有恢复了的病人一样——真有些像喜庆事。凡有他所看见的一切，都仿佛在向他欣然微笑，连街上的房屋和农奴，但他们的态度，其实是显得很严紧的，其中的许多人，还已经打过他的兄弟一个耳刮子。他最初的访问，总该是知事。他在路上，起了各式各样的想头：忽而想到年青的金头发了，真的，他的空想实在有一点过度，他还自己笑起自己，自己戏弄起自己来了。他以这样的心情，忽然在知事的门前出现。他已经跨进了门口，刚要脱下外套来，门丁却突然走了过来，用这样的话吓了他一跳：“我受过命令，不放您进去！”

“怎的？你说什么？你不认得我吗？看清楚些！”乞乞科夫诧异着说。

“我是认得您的！我看见您也不只一两回了，”那门丁道，“只有您一个我不能放进去；别人都行，只有您不！”

“唔，怎么？为什么只有我不，为什么不？”

“是命令这么说；他总有他的缘故的。”门丁道，还添上一声“喳”，就摆出放肆模样，把他拦住，不再有先前巴结的给他脱外套时候那样殷勤的微笑了。他好像自己在想着：“哼！如果大人先生们不准你进门，那么你一定是个下等人！”

“奇怪！”乞乞科夫想，立刻去访审判厅长去；但厅长一晃他的面，就非常狼狈，至于吃吃的讲不出两句话，大家说了些无谓的攀谈，弄得彼此都很窘。乞乞科夫走掉了，他在路上竭力的思索，要猜出厅长是什么的意见，他的话里含着怎样的意义来，但是什么也没有做到。他于是再去访别人：访警察局长，访副知事，访邮政局长，然而并不招待他，或者给他一种非常奇特的招待，说些莫名其妙的话，令人很发烦，要以为他们实在有点不清醒。他又访了一个人，还找着几个熟识者，想知道这变化的缘故，却仍然不得手。他仿佛半睡似的在街上徘徊，决不定是他自己发懵呢还是官员们失了神，这一切都不过是一个梦呢还是比梦更无味的，荒谬胡涂的真实。迟到晚上，已经黑下来了，他这才回到他高高兴兴的出了门的自己的旅馆去，叫人备茶，来排遣烦闷和无聊。他沉思的推察着他这奇怪的景况，斟出一杯茶来的时候，突然间，房门开处，走进他万料不到的罗士特来夫来了。

“俗谚里说过的，为朋友不怕路远，”那人大声说，除下了帽子，“我刚刚走过这里，看见你的窗子里还亮。‘他大约还没有睡觉，’我想，‘我得跑上去瞧一瞧。’阿唷！这可是好极了，你有茶，我很愿意喝一杯：今天吃了各式各样的东西，我的肚子里在造反了！给我装一筒烟罢。你的烟筒在那里？”

“我可是不吸烟的。”乞乞科夫不大理会的说。

“胡说，你是一个大瘾头的吸烟家，还当我不知道。喂！你的用人叫什么呀？喂，瓦赫拉米，听哪！”

“他不叫瓦赫拉米，他叫彼得尔希加。”

“怎么？你先前不有一个瓦赫拉米吗？”

“我这里可并没有！”乞乞科夫说。

“不错，真的。那是台累平的，他有一个瓦赫拉米。你想，台累平有多么好运道：他的婶娘和自己的儿子吵架，因为他和婢女结了婚，她就把全部财产都送给台累平了。这才有意思哩，如果我们这边有这样的一位婶娘，你知道，那才是好出息，对不对？告诉我，朋友，为什么你忽然这么的躲了起来，大家简直不再看见你了！我知道，你是在研究学术上的物事的，书也看的很多。（罗士特来夫从那里决定，我们的主角是在研究学术上的物事，而且书也看的很多的呢，我们只好声明我们的抱歉，可惜不能泄漏，然而乞乞科夫却更不能。）听哪，乞乞科夫！如果你单是看见……也就该有益于你那讽刺的精神了——（为什么乞乞科夫会有一种讽刺的精神呢——可惜也简直不明白。）你想想看，好朋友，新近在商人列哈且夫那里，我们去打牌，呵，可是笑得可以。贝来本全夫，就是和我同在那里的，总是说：‘如果乞乞科夫在这里，他就用得着这些了！’（乞乞科夫却一向没有和贝来本全夫见过面。）哦，招认罢，乖乖，那一回你可实在玩的没出息，你还记得吗，我们下棋的时候？我确是赢了的……然而你简直诓骗我！但是，妈的，我是不会恼的怎么久的。新近在厅长那里……哦，不错，我还得告诉你：市里是谁都和你决裂了！他们相信，你造假钞票……大家忽然都找着我——哪，我自然遮住你，好像一座山——我对他们说：我们是同学，我认识你的父亲；总而言之，我狠狠的骗了他们一下子！”

“我造假钞票？”乞乞科夫叫喊着，从椅子上跳了起来。

“但是你为什么也使他们这样的吃惊的？”罗士特来夫接着说。“他们实在是吓得半疯了：他们当你是侦探和强盗。——检事就因为受惊，死掉了……明天下葬。你豫备去送吗？老实说，他们是怕新总督，还怕因为你再闹出什么故事来；关于总督，我自然是这样的意见，如果他太骄傲，太摆架子，和贵族们是弄不好的。贵族们要亲热，对不对？自然也可以躲在自己的屋子里，一个跳舞会也不开，然而这有什么用？更没有好处。但是，听哪，乞乞科夫你可是真的在干危险事情呀！”

“怎样的危险事情？”乞乞科夫不安的回问道。

“哪，诱拐知事的女儿。老实说，我是料到了的，天在头上，我是料到了的！我在跳舞会上一看见你：‘哪！’我就心里想，‘乞乞科夫在这里还有缘故哩……’但是你没有眼睛；我从她那里简直找不出一点好处来。另外有，毕苦梭夫的亲戚，他的姊妹的女儿，那可是一个美人儿！这才可以说：就是一个出色！”

“你在说什么废话？谁要拐知事的女儿？你什么意思？”乞乞科夫不懂似的凝视着他，说。

“不要玩花样了，好朋友：好一个秘密大家！我明白的说出来罢，我就是为了这事，跑到你这里来的，要给你出一点力。我可以帮你结婚，并且把我的车子和马匹借给你去诱拐，不过有一个条件：你得借我三千卢布。我正在一个没法的景况中，就是要用。”

在罗士特来夫的这些胡说白道之间，乞乞科夫擦了好几回眼睛，查考他是否在做梦。假钞票，知事的女儿的诱拐，原因该起于他的检事的死亡，新总督的到任，这些一切，都使他吃惊不小。“唉，糟了，如果是这样的情形，”他想，“我可迁延不得了，我应该赶紧走。”

他设法把罗士特来夫从速支使出去，立刻叫了绥里方来，命令他一到天亮就得准备妥当，因为明早六点钟就要从这市上出发。他又嘱咐他检查一遍，车子上是否添好了油，等等，等等。绥里方单是说：“知道了，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”却在门口站了一会，动也不动。主人又命令彼得尔希加立刻从卧床底下，拖出那积满了灰尘的箱子来，和那小子动手收拾他所有的物件；这并不费事，他只是什么都随手抛进箱子里面去：袜子，小衫，干净的和龌龊的衬衣，靴楦，一个日历之类。这些都收拾的很匆忙，因为他要在这一夜里全都整好，以免明天早上白费了时光。绥里方还在门口站了一两分钟，于是走掉了。以总算还在意料之中的谨慎和缓慢，把他那湿的长靴的印子留在踏坏了的梯级上，走下楼梯去。他在那里又站了不少的工夫，搔着后脑壳。这举动，是什么意思？它所表示的究竟是什么呢？是在懊恼和那里的一个也是身穿破皮袍，腰系破皮带的伙伴，明天同到什么御酒馆里去的约定，因此不成功；还是在这新地方已经发生了交情，舍不得一到黄昏，红小衫的青年们在宫女面前弹起巴拉拉加来，人们卸下白天的重担和疲劳，低声谈天时候的门前的伫立，和殷勤的握手——还是不过因为要离开那穿了皮袍，坐在那里的厨房里的炉边的暖热之处，京里才有的白菜汤和软馒头的同人，从新在雨雪之卞，去受旅行的颠连和辛苦，所以觉得苦痛呢？这只有上帝知道——谁愿意猜，猜就是。俄国的人民一搔后脑壳，是表示着很多意思的。

第十一章


出现的却完全是乞乞科夫意料以外的事。首先是他醒得比想定的太晚了——这是第一件不高兴——他一起来，就叫人下去问车子整好了没有，马匹驾好了没有，一切旅行的事情，是否都已经准备停当，但恼人的是他竟明白了马匹并没有驾好，而且毫无一点什么旅行的准备——这是第二件不高兴。他气忿起来了，要给我们的朋友绥里方着着实实的当面吃一拳，就焦灼的等着，不管他来说怎样的谢罪的话。绥里方也立刻在门口出现了，这时他的主人，就得受用凡有急于旅行的人，总得由他的仆役听一回的一番话。

“不过马匹的马掌先得钉一下呀，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支！”

“唉唉，你这贱胎！你这昏蛋，你！为什么你不早对我说的？你没有工夫吗？”

“唔，对，工夫自然是有的……不过轮子也不行了，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支……总得换一个新箍，路上是有这么多的高低，窟窿，不平得很……哦，还有，我又忘记了一点事：车台断了，摇摇摆摆的，怕挨不到两站路。”

“这恶棍！”乞乞科夫叫了起来，两手一拍，奔向绥里方去，使他恐怕要遭主人的打，吓得倒退了几步。

“你要我的命吗？你要谋害我吗？是不是？你要像拦路强盗似的，在路上杀死我吗？你这猪猡，你这海怪！三个礼拜，我们在这里一动也不动！只要他来说一声，这不中用的家伙！他却什么都挨到这最末的时光！现在，已经要上车，动身了，他竟对人来玩这一下！什么……你早就知道的罢？还是没有知道？怎么样？说出来？唔？”

“自然！”绥里方回答说，低了头。

“那么，你为什么不说的？为什么？”对于这问题，没有回答。绥里方还是低了头，站在那里，好像在对自己说：“你看见这事情闹成怎样了吗？我原是早就知道的，不过没有说！”

“那就立刻跑到铁匠那里去，叫了他来。要两个钟头之内全都弄好，懂了没有？至迟两个钟头！如果弄不好，那么——那么，我就把你捆成一个结子！”我们的主角非常愤怒了。

绥里方已经要走了，去奉行他的主人的命令；但他又想了一想，站下来说道：“您知道，老爷，那匹花马，到底也只好卖掉，真的，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，那真是一条恶棍……天在头上，那么的一匹坏马，是只会妨碍趱路的！”

“哦？我就跑到市场去，卖掉它来罢。好不好？”

“天在头上，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支。它不过看起来有劲道；其实是靠不住的，这样的马，简直再没有……”

“驴子！如果我要卖掉，我会卖掉的。这东西还在这里说个不完！听着：如果你不给我立刻叫一两个铁匠来，如果不给我把一切都在两个钟头之内办好，我就给你兜鼻一拳，打得你昏头昏脑！跑，快去！跑！”绥里方走出屋子去了。

乞乞科夫的心情非常之恶劣，恨恨地把长刀抛在地板上，这是他总是随身带着，用它恐吓人们，并且保护威严的。他和铁匠们争论了一刻多钟，这才说定了价钱，因为他们照例是狡猾的贼胚，一看出乞乞科夫在赶忙，就多讨了六倍。他很气恼，说他们是贼骨头，是强盗，是拦路贼，他们也什么都不怕；他只好诅咒，用末日裁判来吓他们；然而这对于铁匠帮也毫无影响，他们一口咬定，不但连一文也不肯让，还不管两个钟头的约定，化去整整五个半钟头，这才修好了马车。这之间，乞乞科夫就只得消受着出色的时光，这是凡有出门人全都尝过的，箱子理好了，屋子里只剩下几条绳子，几个纸团，以及别样的废物，人是还没有上车，然而也不能静静的停在屋子里，终于走到窗口，去看看下面在街上经过，或是跑过的人们，谈着他们的银钱，抬起他们的呆眼，诧异的来看他，使不能动身的可怜的旅人，更加焦急。一切东西，凡是他所看见的：面前的小铺子，住在对面的屋子里，时时跑到挂着短帘的窗口来的老太婆的头——无不使他讨厌，然而他又不能决计从窗口离开。他一步不移，没有思想，忘记了自己，忘记了周围，只等着立刻到来的切实的目的。他麻木的看着在身边活动的一切，结果是懊恼的捺杀了一匹在玻璃上叫着撞着，投到他指头下面来的苍蝇。然而世间的事，是总有一个结局的，这渴望的时刻到底等到了。车台已经修好，轮子嵌了新箍，马匹也喝过水，铁匠们再数了一回工钱，祝了乞乞科夫一路平安之后，走掉了。终于是马也驾在车子前面了；还赶忙往车里装上两个刚刚买来的热的白面包，坐到车台上去的绥里方，也把一点什么东西塞在衣袋里，我们的主角就走出旅馆，来上他的车，欢送的是永远穿着呢布礼服的侍者，摇着他的帽子在作别，还有来看客人怎么出发的，本馆和外来的几个仆役和车夫，以及出门时候总不会缺的一切附属的事物；乞乞科夫坐进篷车里面去，于是这久停在车房里，连读者也恐怕已经觉得无聊起来的熟识的鳏夫的车子，就往门外驶出去了。“谢谢上帝！”乞乞科夫想，并且划了一个十字。绥里方鸣着鞭，彼得尔希加呢，先是站在踏台上面的，不久就和他并排坐下了，我们的主角是在高加索毯子上坐安稳，把皮靠枕垫在背后，紧压着两个热的白面包，那车子就从新迸跳起来了，多谢铺石路，可真有出色的震动力。乞乞科夫怀着一种奇特的，莫名其妙的心情，看着房屋，墙壁，篱垣和街道，都跟着车子的迸跳，显得一起一落，在他眼前慢慢的移过去。上帝知道，在他一生中，可还能再见不能呢？到一条十字路口，车子只得停止了，是被一个沿着大街，蜿蜒而来的大出丧遮了道。乞乞科夫把头伸出车子外面去，叫彼得尔希加问一问，这去下葬的是什么人。于是知道了这人是检事。乞乞科夫满不舒服的连忙缩在一个角落里，放下车子的皮帘，遮好了窗幔。当篷车停着的时候，绥里方和彼得尔希加都恭恭敬敬的脱了帽，留心注视着行列，尤其有味的是车子和其中的坐客，还好像在数着坐车的是多少人，步行的是多少人；他们的主人吩咐了他们不要和别人招呼，不要和熟识的仆役话别之后，也从皮幔的小窗洞里在窥探着行列。一切官员都露了顶，恭送着灵柩。乞乞科夫怕他们会看见自己的篷车；然而他们竟毫没有注意到。当送葬之际，他们是连平时常在争论的实际问题也没有提一句的。他们的思想都集中于自己；他们在想着新总督究竟是怎样的一个人，他怎样的办这事，怎样的对他们。步行的官员们之后，跟着一串车子，里面是闺秀们，露着黑色的衣帽。看那手和嘴唇的动作，就知道她们是在起劲的谈天：大约也是议论新总督的到来，尤其是关于他要来开的跳舞会的准备，而且现在已在愁着自己的新的褶纽和发饰了。马车之后，又来了几辆空车子，一辆接着一辆的，后来就什么也没有了，道路旷荡，我们的主角就又可以往前走。他拉开皮幔，从心底里叹出一口气来，说道：“这是检事！他做了一辈子人，现在可是死掉了！现在是报上怕要登载，说他在所有属员和一切人们的大悲痛之下，长辞了人间，他是一位可敬的市民，希有的父亲，丈夫的模范；他们怎不还要大写一通呢：恐怕接下去就说，那寡妇孤儿的血泪，一直送他到了坟头；然而如果接近的看起事情来，一探他的底细，那么，除了你的浓眉毛之外，你可是毫没有什么动人之处了。”于是他吩咐绥里方赶快走，并且对自己说道：“我们遇着了大出丧，可是好得很，人说，路上看见棺材，是有运气的。”

这之间，车子已经通过了郊外的空虚荒僻的道路，立刻看见两面只有显示着街市尽头的延长的木栅子了。现在是铺石路也已走完，市门和市镇都在旅人的背后——到了荒凉的公路上。车子就又沿着驿道飞跑，两边是早就熟识了的景象：路标；站长；井；车子；货车；灰色的村庄和它的茶炊；农妇和拿着一个燕麦袋，跑出客栈来的活泼的大胡子的汉子；足蹬破草鞋，恐怕已经走了七百维尔斯他的巡行者；热闹的小镇和它那木造的店铺，粉桶，草鞋，面包和其余的旧货；斑驳的市门柱子；正在修缮的桥梁；两边的一望无际的平野；地主的旅行马车；骑马的兵丁，带一个满装枪弹的绿箱子，上面写道：送第几炮兵连！田地里的绿的，黄的，或则新耕的黑色的长条；在平野中到处出没，从远地里传来的忧郁的歌曲；淡烟里的松梢；漂到的钟声；蝇群似的乌鸦队；以及无穷无尽的地平线……唉唉，俄国呵！我的俄国呀！我在看你，从我那堂皇的，美丽的远处在看你了。贫瘠，很散漫和不愉快是你的各省府，没有一种造化的豪放的奇迹，曾蒙豪放的人工的超群之作的光荣——令人惊心悦目的，没有可见造在山石中间的许多窗牖的高殿的市镇，没有如画的树木和绕屋的藤萝，珠玑四溅的不竭的瀑布；用不着回过头去，去看那高入云际的岩岫；不见葡萄枝，藤蔓和无数野蔷薇交织而成的幽暗的长夹道；也不见那些后面的耸在银色天空中的永久灿烂的高峰。你只是坦白，荒凉，平板；就像小点子，或是细线条，把你的小市镇站在平野里；毫不醒一下我们的眼睛。然而是一种什么不可捉摸的，非常神秘的力量，把我拉到你这里去的呢？为什么你那忧郁的，不息的，无远弗届，无海弗传的歌声，在我们的耳朵里响个不住的呢？有怎么一种奇异的魔力藏在这歌里面？其中有什么在叫唤，有什么在呜咽，竟这么奇特的抓住了人心？是什么声音，竟这么柔和我们的魂灵，深入心中，给以甜美的拥抱的呢？唉唉，俄国呵！说出来罢，你要我怎样？我们之间有着怎样的不可捉摸的联系？你为什么这样的凝视我，为什么怀着你所有的一切一切，把你的眼睛这么满是期望的向着我的呢？……我还是疑惑的，不动的站着，含雨的阴云已经盖在我的头上，而且把在你的无边的广漠中所发生的思想沉默了。这不可测度的开展和广漠是什么意思？莫非因为你自己是无穷的，就得在这里，在你的怀抱里，也生出无穷的思想吗？空间旷远，可以施展，可以迈步，这里不该生出英雄来吗？用了它一切的可怕，深深的震动了我的心曲的雄伟的空间，吓人的笼罩着我；一种超乎自然的力量，开了我的眼……唉唉，怎么的一种晃耀的，稀奇的，未知的广远呵！我的俄国！……

“停住，停住，你这驴子！”乞乞科夫向绥里方叫喊道。

“我马上用这刀砍掉你！”一个飞驰的急差吆喝着，他胡子长有三尺多。“你不看见吗，这是官车？妈的！”于是那三驾马车，就像幻影似的在雷和烟云中消失了。

然而这两个字里可藏着多么希罕的，神奇的蛊惑：公路！而且又多么的出色呢，这公路！一个晴天，秋叶，空气是凉爽的……你紧紧的裹在自己的雨衣里，帽子拉到耳朵边，舒服的缩在你的车角上！到得后来，寒气就从肢节上走掉，涌出温暖来了。马在跑着……有些瞌睡了起来。眼睑合上了。朦胧中还听到一点“雪不白呀……”的歌儿，马的鼻息和轮子的响动，终于是把你的邻人挤在车角里，高声的打了鼾。然而你现在醒来了，已经走过了五站；月亮升在空中；你经过一个陌生的市镇，有旧式圆屋顶和昏沉的尖塔的教堂，有阴暗的木造的和雪白的石造的房屋；处处有一大条闪烁的月光，白麻布头巾似的罩在墙壁和街道上，漆黑的阴影斜躺在这上面，照亮了的木屋顶，像闪闪的金属一般的在发着光；一个人也没有：都睡了觉。只有一个孤独的灯，还点在这里或是那里的小窗里：是居民在修自己的长靴，或则面包师正在炉边做事罢？——你不高兴什么呢？唉唉，怎样的夜……天上的力！在这上面的是怎样的夜呀！唉唉，空气，唉唉，天空，在你那莫测的深处，在我们的上头，不可捉摸的明朗地，响亮地展开着的又高又远的天空！……夜的凉爽的呼息，吹着你的眼睛，唱着使你入于甜美的酣睡；于是你懵腾了，全不自觉，而且打鼾了——然而被你挤在车角上的可怜的邻人，却因为你这太重的负担，忿忿的一摇。你又从新醒了转来，你的面前就又是田地和平原；只见无际的野地，此外什么也没有。路标一个个的跑过去；天亮了；在苍白的，寒冷的地平线上，露出微弱的金色的光芒，朝风冷冰冰的，有力的吹着耳朵。你要裹好着外套！多么出色的寒冷呵！又来招你的睡眠可多么稀奇！一震又震醒了你。太阳已经升在天顶了。“小心，小心！”你的旁边有人在喊着，车子驰下了峻坡来。下面等着一只渡船；一个很大的清池，在太阳下，铜锅似的发闪；一个村庄，坡上是如画的小屋；旁边闪烁着村教堂的十字架，好像一颗星；蜂鸣似的响着农夫们的起劲的闲谈，还有肚子里的熬不下去的饥饿……我的上帝，这很远很远的旅行的道路，可是多么美丽呵！每当陷没和沉溺，我总是立刻缒住你，你也总是拉我上来，宽仁的抓着我的臂膊！而且由这样子，又产生了多少满是神异的诗情的雄伟的思想和梦境，多少幸福的印象充实了魂灵！……

这时候，我们的朋友乞乞科夫的梦想，也不再这样的全是散文一类了。我们且来看一看他起了怎样的感情罢！首先是他简直毫无所感，单是不住的回过头去看，因为要断定那市镇是否的确已经在他的背后；但待到早已望不见，也没有了打铁店，没有了磨粉作坊，以及凡在市旁边常常遇着的一切，连石造教堂的白色塔尖也隐在地平线后的时候，他却把全盘注意都向着路上了；他向两边看，把N市忘得干干净净，好像他在很久，很久之前，还是早先的孩子时代，曾在那里住过似的。终于也遇到了使他觉得无聊的路，他就略闭了眼睛，把头靠在皮枕上。作者应该声明，到底找着了来说几句关于他那主角的话的机会，这是他觉得很高兴的，因为直到现在，实在总是——读者自己也很知道——忽而被罗士特来夫，忽而被什么一个跳舞会，忽而被闺秀们或者街谈巷议，或是许多别的小事情所妨碍，这些小事情，要写进书里去，这才显得它小，但还在世界上飞扬之际，是当作极其重大，极其要紧的事件的。现在我们却要放下一切，专来做这工作了。

我很怀疑，我这诗篇里的主角，是否中了读者的意。在闺秀们中，他完全没有被中意，是已经可以断定的——因为闺秀们都愿意她们的主角是一位无不完全的模范，只要有一点极小的体质上或是精神上的缺点，那就从此完结了。作者更深一层的映进了他的魂灵，当作镜子来照清他的形象——这人在她们的眼睛里也还是毫无价值。乞乞科夫的肥胖和中年，就已经该是他的非常吃亏之处，这肥胖，是没有人原谅的，许多闺秀们会轻蔑的转过脸去，并且说道：“呸，多么讨厌！”唉唉，真是的！这些一切，作者都很明白，但话虽如此——他却还不能选一个正人君子来做主角……然而……在这故事里，可也许会听到未曾弹过的弦索，看见俄罗斯精神的无限的丰饶，一个男子，有神明一般的特长和德性，向我们走来，或者一个出色的俄国女儿，具有女性的一切之美，满是高尚的努力，甘作伟大的牺牲，在全世界上找不出第二个！别个种族里的一切有德的男男女女，便在他们面前褪色，消失，恰如死文学的遇见了活言语一样！俄罗斯精神的一切强有力的活动，就要朗然分明……而且要明白了别国民不过触着浮面的，斯拉夫性情却抓得多么深，捏得多么紧……然而，为什么我应该来叙述另外还有什么事呢？已经到了男子的成年，锻炼过内面生活的严厉的苦功和孤独生活的清净的克己的诗人，倒像孩子似的忘其所以，是不相称的。各个事物，都自有它的地位和时候！然而也仍不选有德之士为主角。我们还可以说一说他为什么不选的原因。这是因为已经到了给可怜的有德家伙休息的时候；因为“有德之士”这句话已经成了大家的口头禅；因为人们已经将有德之士当作竹马，而且没有一个作家不骑着他驰驱，还用鞭子以及天知道什么另外的东西鞭策他前进；因为人们已经把有德之士驱使得要死，快要连道德的影子也不剩，他身上只还留下几条肋骨和一点皮，因为人们简直已经并不尊重有德之士了。不，究竟也到了把坏人驾在车子前面的时候了！那么，我们就把他来驾在我们的车子前面吧！

我们的主角的出身，是不大清楚的。他的两亲是贵族，世袭的，还不过是本身的贵族呢——却只有敬爱的上帝明白。而且他和父母也不相像，至少，当他生下来的时候，有一个在场的亲戚，是生得很小俏的太太，我们乡下称为野鸭的，就抱着孩子，叫了起来道：“阿呀，我的天哪！这可和我豫料的一点不对呀！我想他是该像外祖母的，那就很好，不料他竟一点也不这样，倒如俗语里说的：不像爷，不像娘，倒像一个过路少年郎。”一开头，人生就偏执地，懊恼地，仿佛通过了一个遮着雪的昏暗的窗门似的来凝视他了；他的儿童时代，就没有一个朋友，也没有一个伙伴！一间小房子，一个小窗子，无论冬，夏，总是不开放；他的父亲是一个病人，身穿羊皮里子的长外褂，赤脚套着编织的拖鞋；他在屋子里踱来踱去，叹着气，把唾沫吐在屋角的沙盂里，孩子就得永远坐在椅子上，捏着笔，指头和嘴唇沾满了墨水，当面学着不能规避的字：“汝毋妄言，应敬尊长，抱道在躬！”拖鞋的永久的拖曳和蹒跚，熟识的永久的森严的言语：“你又发昏了吗？”如果孩子厌倦了练习的单调，在字母上加一个小钩子或者小花纹，就得接受这一句；于是，是久已熟识，然而也总是苦痛的感觉，跟着这句话，就从背后伸过长指头的爪甲来，把耳轮拧得非常之疼痛。这是他最初的做孩子的景象，只剩下一点模胡的记忆了的。然而人生都变化得很突然和飞快：一个好天气的日子，春日的最初的光线刚刚温暖了地面，小河才开始着潺湲，那父亲就携着他的儿子的手，上了一辆四轮车，拉的是在我们马业们中，叫作“喜鹊”的小花马；一个矮小的驼背的车夫赶着车，他是乞乞科夫的父亲所有的惟一的一家农奴的家长。这旅行几乎有一日半之久，在路上过了一夜，渡过一条小河，吃着冷馒头和烤羊肉，到第三天的早晨，这才到了市镇上。意外的辉煌和街道的壮丽，都给孩子一个很深的印象，使他诧异到大张了嘴巴。后来“喜鹊”和车子都陷在泥洼里了，这地方是一条又狭又峭，满是泥泞的街道的进口，那马四脚满是泥污，下死劲的挣了许多工夫，靠着驼背车夫和主人自己的策励，这才终于把车子和坐客从泥泞中拉出，到了一个小小的前园；这是站在小冈子上面的；旧的小房屋前面有两株正在开花的苹果树，树后是一片简陋的小园，只有一两株野薇，接骨木，和一直造在里面的小木屋，盖着木板，有一个半瞎的小窗。这里住着乞乞科夫的亲戚，是一位老得打皱的老婆婆，然而每天早晨还到市场去，后来就在茶炊上烘干她的袜子。她敲敲孩子的面颊，喜欢他长得这么胖，养得这么好。在这里，他就得从此住下，去进市立学校了。那父亲在老婆婆家里过了一夜。第二天就又上了路，回到家里去。当他的儿子和他作别的时候，他并没有淌下眼泪来：他给了半卢布的铜元，做做零用，更其重要的倒是几句智慧的教训：“你听哪，保甫卢沙，要学正经，不要胡涂，也不要胡闹，不过最要紧的是要博得你的上头和教师的欢心。只要和你的上头弄好，那么，即使你生来没有才能，学问不大长进，也都不打紧；你会赛过你所有的同学的。不要多交朋友，他们不会给你多大好处的；如果要交，那就拣一拣，要拣有钱有势的来做朋友，好帮帮你的忙，这才有用处。不要乱化钱，滥请客，倒要使别人请你吃，替你化；但顶要紧的是：省钱，积钱，世界上的什么东西都可以不要，这却不能不要的。朋友和伙伴会欺骗你，你一倒运，首先抛弃你的是他们，但钱是永不会抛弃你的，即使遭了艰难或危险！只要有钱，你想怎样就怎样，什么都办得到，什么都做得成。”给了这智慧的教训之后，那父亲就受了他的儿子的告别，和“喜鹊”一同回去了。那儿子就从此不再看见他，然而他的言语和教训，却深刻的印进了魂灵。

到第二天，保甫卢沙就上学校去了。对于规定的学科，他并不见得有特别的才能；优秀之处倒在肯用功和爱整洁；然而他立刻又迸出一种另外的才能来：很切实的智力。他立刻明白了办法，和朋友交际，就遵照着父亲的教训，那就是使他们请自己吃，给自己化，他自己却一点也不破费，而且有时还得到赠品，后来看着机会，仍旧卖给原先的赠送者。事事俭省，是他孩子时候就学好了的。从父亲得来的半卢布，他不但一文也没有化，在这一年里倒还增加了数目，这是因为他显出一种伟大的创业精神来：用白蜡做成云雀，画得斑斓悦目，非常之贵的卖掉了。后来有一时期，他又试办着别样的投机事业，用的是这样的方法：他到市场上去买了食物来，进得学校，就坐在最富足，最有钱的人的旁边；一看出一个同学无精打采了——这就是觉得肚饿的征候——他就装作并非故意模样，在椅子下面，给他看见一个姜饼或者面饼的一角。待到引得人嘴馋，他于是取得一个价钱，并无一定，以馋的大小为标准。两个月之久，他又在房里不断的训练着一匹关在小木笼里的鼠子；到底练得那鼠子会听着命令，用后脚直立，躺倒，站起了，他就一样的卖掉，得了大价钱。用这样的法子，积到大约五个卢布的时候，便缝在一个小袋里，再重新来积钱。和学校的上头的关系，他可更要聪明些。谁也不及他，能在椅子上坐得鼠子一般静。我们在这里应该声明一下，教师是最喜欢安静的人，而对于机灵的孩子却是受不住的；他觉得他们常常在笑他。一个学生，如果先被认作狡猾，爱闹的了，那么，他只要在椅子上略略一动，无意的把眉头一皱，教师就要对他发怒。他毫不宽假的窘迫他，责罚他。“我要教好你的骄傲和反抗！”他叫喊着说。“我看得你清清楚楚，比你自己还清楚！跪下！你要知道肚子饿是什么味道了！”于是这孩子就应该擦破膝盖，挨饿一天，连自己也不明白为什么。“本领，资质，才能——这都是胡说白道！”教师常常说。“我顶着重的是品行。一个彬彬有礼的学生，就是连字母也不认识，一切学科我还是给他很好的分数；但一给我看出回嘴和笑人的坏脾气——就给一个零分，即使他有一个梭伦(1)藏在衣袋里！”所以他也很忿忿的憎恶克理罗夫(2)，因为这人在他的寓言里说过：“喝酒毫不要紧，但要明白事情！”他又时常十分满足的，脸上和眼里全都光辉灿烂的，讲述他先前教过的学校，竟有这么安静，连一个蝇子在屋里飞过，也可以听出来，整整一个年，学生在授课时间中敢发一声咳嗽，擤一下鼻子的，连一回也没有，直到摇铃为止，谁也辨不出教室里有没有人。乞乞科夫立刻捉着了教师的精神和意思，懂得这好品行是什么了。在授课时间中，无论别人怎么来拧他，来抓他，他连一动眼，一皱眉的事，也一回也没有；铃声一响，乞乞科夫可就没命的奔到门口去，为的是争先把帽子递给那教师——那教师戴的是一顶普通的农家帽；于是首先跑出了教室，设法和他在路上遇到好几回，每一回又恭恭敬敬的除下了帽子。他的办法得了很出色的效验。自从他入校以来，成绩一直都很好，毕业是优等的文凭和全学科最好的分数，另外还有一本书，印着金字道：“敦品励学之赏。”当他离开学校的时候，已经是一个有着必须常常修剃的下巴的一表非凡的青年了。这时就死掉了他的父亲。他留给自己的儿子的是四件破旧的粗呢小衫，两件羊皮里子的旧长褂，以及全不足道的一点钱。那父亲分明是只会说节俭的好教训，自己却储蓄得很有限的。乞乞科夫立刻把古老的小屋子和连带的瘠地一起卖了一千个卢布，把住着的一家农奴送到市里去，自己就在那里住下，给国家去服务了。这时候，那最着重安静和好品行的可怜的教师，不知道为了他没本领，还是一种别的过失呢，却失了业；因为气愤，他就喝起酒来；但又立刻没有了酒钱；生病，无法可想，连一口面包也得不到，他只好长久饿在一间冰冷的偏僻的搁楼里。那些先前为了顽皮和乖巧，他总是斥为顽梗和骄傲的学生们，一知道他的景况，便赶紧来募集一点钱，有几个还因此卖掉了自己的缺少不得的物件；只有保甫卢沙·乞乞科夫却推托了，说他一无所有，单捐了一枚小气的五戈贝克的银钱，同学们向他说了一句：哼，你这吝啬鬼！便抛在地上了。可怜的教师一知道他先前的学生的这举动，就用两手掩了脸；像一个孱弱的孩子，眼泪滔滔不绝，涌出他昏浊的眼睛来，“在临死的床上，上帝还送我这眼泪！”他用微弱的声音说；到得知道了乞乞科夫怎样对他的时候，他就苦痛的叹息，接着道：“唉唉，保甫卢沙，保甫卢沙！人是多么会变化呵！他曾是怎样的一个驯良的好孩子呀！他毫不粗野，软得像丝绢一样。他骗了我了，唉唉，他真的骗了我了！……”

但也不能说我们的主角的天性，竟有这样的冷酷和顽固，感情竟有这样的麻木，至于不知道怜悯和同情。这两种感情，他是都很觉得的，而且还准备了帮助，只因为他不能动用那决计不再动用的款子，所以也不能捐很多的钱；总而言之，父亲的“要省钱，积钱”的忠告，是已经落在肥地上了。不过他也并非为钱而爱钱；吝啬还不全是支配他的发条。不是的，这并非指使他的原动力；他所企慕的是无不舒服的安乐富足的生活，车马，整顿的家计，美味的饭菜——这才是占领了他，驱策着他的东西。所以他要刻苦了自己和别人，一文一文的省钱，积钱，直到尝饱了这一切阔绰的时候。倘有一个有钱人坐了华美的轻车，驾着马具辉煌的高头大马从他旁边经过，他就生根似的站下来，于是好像从大梦里醒来一样，说道：“而且他是一个普通的助理，却烫着蜷头发！”凡有显示着豪富和安乐的，都给他一个很深的印象，连他自己也不很明白是怎么一回事。出了学校以后，他一刻也没有安静过：希望很强，要赶快找一种职业，给国家去服务。然而，虽有优等的文凭，却不过就了财政厅里的一个不相干的位置；没有奥援，是弄不到很远的窠儿的！终于他又找着了一点小事情，薪水每年三四十卢布。但他决计献身于这职务，把所有的障碍都打退，克服。他真的显出未曾前闻的克己和忍耐来了，用最要的事情来节制了自己的需要。从早晨一早起到很迟的晚上止，总是毫不疲倦的坐在桌子前面，倾注精神和肉体的全力，写呀写呀，都化在他的文件上，不很回家，睡在办公室的桌子上，有时就和当差的和管门的一同吃中饭，而且知道顶要紧的是干净的，高尚的外观，衣服像样，脸上有一种令人愉快的表情，还要从举动上，显出他是一位真正的上等人。这里应该说，财政厅的官员，是尤以他们的质朴和讨厌见长的。所有脸孔，都像烤得不好的白面包；一边的面颊是鼓起的，下巴是歪的，上唇肿得像一个水泡，而且还要开着裂；总而言之，他们都很不漂亮。他们都用一种很凶的言语，声音很粗，好像要打人；在巴克呼斯大仙(3)那里，他们献了很多的牺牲，在证明斯拉夫民族里，也还剩着不少邪教的残滓；唔，他们还时常有点醉醺醺的来办公，使办公室实在不愉快，至少也只好称这里的空气为酒香。在这样的官员里，乞乞科夫当然是惹眼的了，一切事情，他几乎和他们完全相反；他的相貌是动人的，他的声音是愉快的，而且什么酒类都不喝。然而他的前途还是很暗淡。他得了一位很老的科长来做上司，是石头似的没感觉和不摇动的好模范；总是不可亲近，脸上从来没有显过一点笑影，对人从来没有给过一句亲热的招呼，或者问一问安好。在家里或在街上，谁也没有见过他和老样子有些不同；他从不表示一点兴趣或者似乎对于别人的运命的同情；没有见过他喝醉和醉得呵呵大笑；没有闹过强盗在酩酊时候似的豪兴，——而且连一点影子也找不出。他是出于善恶之外的，然而在这绝无强烈的感情和情热中，却藏着一点可怕。他那大理石脸孔上，找不出什么不匀称的特征，但也记不起相像的人脸，线条都凑合得很草率。不过一看那许多痘痕和麻点，却是属于那些魔鬼在夜里来撒了豆的脸孔一类的。和这样的人物去亲近，想讨他的欢喜，人总以为决非一切人之力所及的罢；然而乞乞科夫竟去尝试了。他先从各种琐细的小事情上去迎合他；他悉心研究，科长用的鹅毛笔是怎么削法的，于是照样的削好几枝，放在他容易看见的处所，把他桌子上的尘沙和烟灰吹掉，擦去；给墨水瓶换上一块新布片；记住了他的帽子挂在那里——那世界上最讨人厌的帽子，每当散直之前，就取来放在他的旁边；如果他的背脊在墙壁上摩白了，就替他去刷，而且很赶紧。然而这些都丝毫没有效验，仿佛简直并无其事一样。乞乞科夫终于打听到他那上司的家族情形了：他知道他有一个成年的女儿，那脸孔也生得好像“在夜里撒了豆”。于是他就准备从这一边去攻城。他查出了每礼拜日她前去的是那一个教堂；每回都穿得很漂亮，很整齐，衬着出色的笔挺的硬胸衣，站在她对面，这事情有结果：严厉的科长软下来了，邀他去喝茶！马上见了大进步，乞乞科夫就搬到他的家里去，于是又立刻弄得必不可缺；他买面粉和白糖，像自己的未婚妻似的和那女儿来往，称科长先生为“爸爸”，在他的手上接吻。衙门里大家相信，在二月底，大精进日之前，是要举行婚礼的，严厉的科长就替他在自己的上司面前出力，不多久，乞乞科夫自己就当了科长，坐在一个刚刚空出的位置上了。这大约正是他亲近老科长的主要目的，因为在这一天，他就悄悄的把行李搬回家里去，第二天已经住在别的屋子里了。他中止了尊科长为“爸爸”和在他手上接吻，婚礼这件事是从此永远拖下去，几乎好像简直并没有提起过似的。然而他如果遇见科长，却仍旧殷勤的抢先和他握手，请他去喝茶，使这老头子虽然很麻木，极冷淡，也每次摇着头，喃喃自语道：“他骗我，这恶鬼！”

这是最大的难关，然而现在通过了。从此就很容易，一路更加顺当的向前进。大家尊重他起来了。他具备了凡有想要打出这世界去的人们所必需的一切：愉快的态度，优美的举动，以及办事上的大胆的决断。用了这手段，不久就补了一个一般之所谓“好缺”。大家应该知道，在这时候，是开始严禁了收贿的。但一切规条都吓不倒他，倒时常利用它来收自己的利益，而且还显出了每当严禁时候，却更加旺盛的真正俄罗斯式的发明精神来。他的办法是这样的：倘有一个请愿人出现，把手伸进衣袋里，要摸出一张谁都极熟的在我们俄国称为“呵凡斯基公爵绍介信”(4)的来——他就马上显出和气的微笑，紧紧的按住了请愿人的手，说道：“您以为我是……不必，真的！不必！这是我们的义务和责任，就是没有报酬我们也应该办的！这一点，您放心就是。一到明天早上，就什么都妥当了！我可以问您住在那儿吗？您全不必自己费神。一切都会替您送到府上去的！”吃惊的请愿人很感动的回到家里去，自己想道：“这才是一个人！唉唉，要多一点，这才好，这是真的宝石呵！”然而请愿人等候了一天，等候了两天，却还是总不见有他的文件送到家里去。到第三天也一样。他再上官厅去一趟——简直还没有看过他的呈文。他再去找他的宝石。“阿呀，对不起，对不起，”乞乞科夫优雅的说，一面握住了那位先生的两只手，“我们实在忙得要命，但是明天，明天您一定收到的！这真连我自己也非常过意不去！”和这些话，还伴着蛊惑的态度。如果这时衣角敞开了，他就连忙用手来整好，这样的敷衍了对手。然而文件却仍旧没有来，无论明天，后天，以至再后天。请愿人于是要想一想了：“哼，恐怕一定有些别的缘故罢？”他去探问，得了这样的回答：“书记得要一点！”——“当然，我怎么可以不给他呢：他们照例有他们的二十五个戈贝克，可是五十个也可以的。”——“不，那可不行，您至少得给他一张白票子。(5)”——“什么？给书记一张白的？”请愿人吓得叫了起来。“是的，您为什么只是这么的出惊呢？”人回答他说。“书记确是只有他们的二十五戈贝克的，其余的要送到上头去！”于是麻木的请愿人就敲一下自己的头，忿忿的诅咒新规则，诅咒禁收贿和官场的非常精炼的交际式。在先前，人们至少是知道办法：给头儿放一张红的票子(6)在桌子上，事情就有了着落，现在却要牺牲一张白的了，还要化掉整整一礼拜工夫，这才明白其中究竟是怎么一回事！……妈的这大人老爷们的廉洁和清高！请愿人自然是完全不错的：可是现在也不再有收贿：所有上司都是正经的，高尚的人物，只有书记和秘书还是恶棍和强盗。但不多久，乞乞科夫的前面展开一片活动的大场面来了：成立了一个建筑很大的官家屋宇的委员会。在这委员会里，乞乞科夫也入了选，而且是其中的一个最活动的分子。大家立刻来办公。给这官家建筑出力了六年之久，然而为了气候，或者因为材料，这建筑简直不想往前走，总是跨不出地基以外去。但会里的委员们，却在市边的各处，造起一排京式的很好看的屋子来了，大约是那些地方的地面好一点。委员老爷们已经开始在享福，并且立了家庭的基础。到现在，乞乞科夫这才在新的景况之下，脱离了他那严厉的禁制和克己的重担的压迫。到现在，他这才对于向来看得很重的大斋(7)规则，决计通融办理，而且到现在，他才明白了对于人还不能自立的如火的青年时代力加抑制的那些享乐，他也并不是敌人。他竟阔绰起来了，雇厨子，买漂亮的荷兰小衫。他也买了外省无法买到的，特别是深灰和发光的淡红颜色的衣料，也办了一对高头大马，还自己来操纵他的车，捏好缰绳，使边马出色的驰骋；现在也已经染上用一块海绵，蘸着水和可伦香水的混合物，来拭身体的习惯了，已经为了要使自己的皮肤软滑，购买重价的肥皂了，已经……

但那老废物的位置上，忽然换了新长官，是一个严厉的军人，贿赂系统和一切所谓不正和不端的死敌。到第二天，他就使所有官员全都惶恐了起来，直到最末的一个；要求收支账目，到处发见了漏洞，看起来，什么总数都不对，立刻注意到京式的体面屋子——而且接着就执行了调查。官员们被停职了；京式屋子被官家所没收，变作各种慈善事业机关和新兵的学校了；所有官员们都受了严重的道德的训斥，而尤其是我们的朋友乞乞科夫。他的脸虽然有愉快的表情，却忽然很招了上司的憎厌——究竟为什么呢——可只有上帝知道；这些事是往往并无缘故的——总之，他讨厌乞乞科夫得要死。而且这铁面无私的长官，发起怒来也可怕得很！然而他究竟不过是一个老兵，不明白文官们的一切精致的曲折和乖巧，别的一些官就仗着相貌老实和办事熟练的混骗，蒙恩得到登用了，于是这位将军就马上落在更大，更坏的恶棍的手里，而他却完全不知道；竟还在满足，自以为找着了好人，而且认真的自负，他怎样的善于从才能和本领上，来辨别和鉴定人。官员们立刻看透了他的性格和脾气。他的下属，就全是激烈的真理疯子，对于不正和不法，都毫不宽容的惩罚；无论那里，一遇到这等事，他们就穷追它，恰如渔人的捏着鱼叉，去追一条肥大的白鲟鱼一样，而且实在也有很大的结果，过不多久，每人就都有几千卢布的财产了。这时候，先前的官员也回来了很不少，又蒙宽恩，仍见收录；只有乞乞科夫独没有再回衙门的运气；虽有将军的秘书长因为一封呵凡斯基公爵的绍介信的督促，很替他出力，替他设法，这人，是最善于控御将军的鼻子的——然而他什么也办不成。将军原是一个被牵着鼻子跑来跑去的人（他自己当然并不觉得的），但倘若他的脑袋里起了一种想头，那就牢得像一枚铁钉，决非人力所能拔出。这聪明的秘书长办得到的一切，是消灭先前的龌龊的履历，然而也只好打动他的长官，是诉之于他的同情，并且用浓烈的色采，向他画出乞乞科夫的悲惨的运命，和他那不幸的，然而其实是幸而完全没有的家族罢了。

“怎么的！”乞乞科夫说。“我钓着的了，拉上来的了，可是这东西又断掉了——这没有话好说。就是号啕大哭，也不能使这不幸变好的。还不如做事情去！”于是他决计从新开始他的行径，用忍耐武装起来，甘心抑制他先前那样的阔绰。他决计搬到一个别的市上去，在那里博得名声。然而一切都不十分顺手。在很短的时光中，他改换了两三回他的职业，因为那些事情，全是龌龊而且讨厌的。读者应该知道，在闲雅和洁净上，乞乞科夫是这世界上不可多得的人。开初虽然也只得在不干净的社会里活动，但他的魂灵却总是纯洁，无瑕的，所以他在衙门的公事房里，桌子也喜欢磁漆，而且一切都见得高尚和精致。他决不许自己的谈吐中，有一句不雅的言语，别人的话里倘有疏忽了他的品级和身分的句子，他也很不高兴。我相信，这大约是读者也很赞成的罢，如果知道了他每两天换一次白衬衫；夏天的大热时候，那就每天换两次：些微的不愉快的气味，他的灵敏的嗅觉机关是受不住的。所以每当彼得尔希加进来替他脱衣服，脱长靴，他总是用两粒丁香塞在鼻孔里；而且他那神经之娇嫩，是往往赛过一位年青小姐的；所以要再混进谁都发着烧酒气，全无礼貌的一伙里面去，真也苦痛得很。他虽然勉力自持，但在这样的逆境和坏运道之下，竟也瘦了一点，而且显出绿莹莹的脸色来了。当读者最初遇见，和他相识的时候，他是正在开始发胖，成了圆圆的，合式的身样了的；每一照镜，他已经常常想到尘世的快乐：一位漂亮的夫人，一间住满的孩子房，于是他脸上就和这思想一同露出微笑；但现在如果偶向镜子一瞥，就不禁叫喊起来道：“神圣的圣母，我是多么丑了呵！”他从此长久不高兴去照镜子了。然而我们的主角担受着一切，坚忍地，勇敢地担受着——于是他到底在税关上得了一个位置。我们应该在这里说明，这样的地位，本来久已是他的秘密希望的对象。他看见过税务官员弄到怎样的好看到出奇的外国货，把怎样的出色的麻纱和磁器去送他的姊妹，教母和婶娘。他屡次叹息着叫喊道：“但愿我也去得成：国界不远，四近都是有教育的人，还能穿多么精致的荷兰小衫呀！”我们还应该附白一下，他也还想着使皮肤洁白柔软，使面颊鲜活发光的一种特别的法兰西肥皂；这是什么商标呢，上帝知道，总之，他推测起来，是只在国界上才有的。所以，他虽然久已神往于税关，但从建筑委员会办事所发生出来的目前的利益，却把他暂时按下，他说得很不错，当建筑委员会还总是手里的麻雀时，税关也不过是屋顶上的鸽子罢了。现在他却已经决定，无论如何要进税关去——而且也真的进去了。他用了真正的火一般热心去办事。好像命里也注定他来做税务官吏似的。三四个礼拜后，他已经把税关事务练习得这样的熟悉，从头到底什么都明白了：他全不用称，也不用量；因为他只要一看发票，立刻知道包裹里有几丈匹头；只消用手把袋子一提，就说得出有多少重量；至于检查，那是他呢，恰如他自己的同事所说一样，简直是“一条好猎狗似的嗅觉”：这也实在很奇怪，他会耐心的去瞎查每个纽扣，而且都做得绝顶的冷静，又是出奇的文雅的。就是那被检查的不幸的对手气得发昏，失了一切自制的力量，恨不得在他愉快的脸上，重重的给一个耳刮子的时候，他也仍然神色自若，总是一样的说得很和气：“您肯赏光，劳您的驾，站起一下子来罢！”或是：“您肯屈驾，太太，到间壁的屋子里去一下么？那里有一位我们公务人员的夫人，想和您谈几句天呢。”或者“请您许可，我在您那外套的里子上，用小刀拆开一点点罢。”和这话同时，他就非常冷静的从这地方拉出头巾，围巾以及别的东西来，简直好像在翻自己的箱子一样。连上司也说，这是一个精怪，不是人。他到处搜出些东西：车轮间，车辕中，马耳朵里，以及上帝知道什么另外的处所，这些处所，没有一个诗人会想到去搜寻，只有税务官员这才想得出来的。那可怜的旅客通过了国境之后，很久还不能定下心神来，揩掉从一切毛孔中涌出的大汗，画一个十字，喃喃的说道：“阿唷，阿唷！”他的境遇好像一个逃出密室来的中学生，教师叫他进去听几句小教训，却竟是完全出于意外的挨了一顿痛打。对于他，私贩子一时毫没有法子想：他是所有波兰一带的犹太人帮的灾星和恶煞。他的正直和廉洁是无比的，而且也是出乎自然以上的。他从那些因为省掉无谓的登记，就不再充公的没收的货品和截留的东西上，决不沾一点光。办事有一种这样的毫不自私自利的热心，当然要惹起大家的惊异，终于也传到长官的耳朵里去了。他升了一级，并且赶紧向长官上了一个条陈，说怎样才可以捕获全部偷运者，加以法办。在这条陈上，还请给他以实行方法的委任。他立刻被任为指挥长，得了施行一切调查搜检的绝对的全权。他所要的就正是这一件。在这时候，私贩们恰恰也成立了一个大团体，做得很有心计，也很有盘算：这无耻的勾当，准备要赚钱一百万。乞乞科夫是早已知道了一点的，但当私贩们派人来通关节时，却遭了拒绝，他很冷淡的说，时候还没有到。一到掌握了一切关键之后，他便使人去通知这团体，告诉他们道：现在是时候了。他算得很正确。只在一年里面，他就能够赚得比二十年的热心办公还要多。他在先前是不愿意和他们合作的，因为他还不像一个棋中之帅，所以分起来也很有限。现在可是完全不同了，现在他可以对他们提出条件去了。因为要事情十分稳当，他又去引别一个官吏加入自己这面来，这计画成功了，那同事虽然头发已经雪白，竟不能拒绝他的诱惑。契约一结好，团体就进向了实行。他们的第一番活动，是见了冠冕堂皇的结果的。读者一定已经听到过关于西班牙羊的巧计的旅行这一个有名的，时常讲起的故事了的罢，那羊外面又蒙着一张皮，通过了国境，皮下面却藏着值到一百万的孛拉彭德(8)的花边。这事情就正出在乞乞科夫做着税务官的时候。如果他自己不去参加这计画，世界上是没有一个犹太人办得妥这类玩艺的。羊通过了国境三四回之后，两个官员就各各有了四十万卢布的财产。哦，人们私议，是乞乞科夫怕要到五十万的了，因为他比别一个还要放肆点。只要没有一匹该死的羊捣乱，上帝才知道这大财是会发到怎么一个值得赞叹的总数呢。恶魔来揽扰这两位官。公羊触动了他们，他们无缘无故的彼此弄出事来了。正在快活的谈天的时候，乞乞科夫也许多喝了一点酒罢，就称那一个官为教士的儿子，那人虽然确是教士的儿子，但不知怎的却非常的以为受辱，就很激烈，很锋利的回过来。他说道：“你胡说！我是五等官，不是教士的儿子。你倒恐怕是教士的儿子！”因为要给对手一个刺，使他更加懊恼，就再添上一句道：“哼，一定是的！”他虽然把加在自己头上的坏话，回敬了我们的乞乞科夫，虽然那“哼，一定是的！”的一转，已经够得利害，他却另外还向长官送了一个秘密的告发。听人说，除此之外，他们俩原已为了一个活泼茁壮的女人，正在争风吃醋了的，那女人呢，用官们的表现法来说，那就是“切实”到像一个萝卜，哦，那人还雇了两个很有力气的家伙，要夜里在一条昏暗的小巷里把我们的主角狠命的打一通；然而到底也还是两位老爷们发胡涂，该女人是已经被一位勖玛哈略夫大尉弄了去的了。那实情究竟怎么样呢，可只有上帝知道。总之，和私贩们的秘密关系是传扬开来，显露出来了。五等文官立刻翻筋斗，但他拉自己的同事也翻了一个筋斗。他们被传到法庭上去，他们的全部财产都被查抄，就像在他们的负罪的头上来了一个晴天霹雳。他们的精神好像被烟雾所笼罩，到得清楚起来，这才栗然的明白了自己犯了什么事，五等文官禁不起这运命的打击，在什么地方穷死了，但六等文官却没有倒运，还是牢牢的站着。纵使前来搜查的官们的嗅觉有多么细致，他也能稳妥的藏下了财产的一部份；他用尽了一切凡有识得透，做得多的深通世故的人的策略和口实：这里用合式的态度，那里用动人的言语，而且用些决不令人难受的谄媚，博得官们的帮忙，有时还塞给他们一点点，总而言之，他知道把他的事情怎么化小，纵使无论如何逃不出刑事裁判，至少，也不像他的同事那样没面子的收场。自然：财产和一切出色的外国货是不见了；这些东西，都跑到别个赏鉴家的手里去了。剩在这里的，是他从这大破绽里救出来的，藏着应急的至多一万卢布，还有两打荷兰小衫，一辆年青独身者所坐的小马车，以及两个农奴：马夫绥里方和跟丁彼得尔希加，此外是因为税务官员的纯粹的好心，留给他的五六块肥皂：使他把他的脸好弄得长是干净和光鲜——这就是一切。我们的主角，现在又一下子陷在这样的逆境里了！忽然来毁坏了他的，是多么一个吓人的坏运道！他称这为：因真理而受苦。人们也许想，在这些变动，历练，运命的打击和人生的恶趣之后，他会带了他那最后的伤心的一万块，躲到外省的平安的角落里，从此在那里锈下去：身穿印花的睡衣，坐在小屋的窗口，看着农夫们在礼拜天怎样的打架，或者也许为了保养，到鸡棚那边去走一趟，查一下那一只可以烧汤，那么，他的生活就真的很闲静，而且为他设想，也并非过得毫无意思的罢。然而全不是这么一回事；对于我们的主角的不屈不挠的性格之坚强，人只好又说他不错。经过了够使一个人纵不灭亡，但遇事总不免沉静和驯良下去的一切这些打击之后，在他那里却仍没有消掉那未曾前闻的热情。他懊恼，他愤怒，唠叨全世界，骂运命的不公平，恨人们的奸恶，然而他不能放掉再来一个新的尝试。总而言之，他显出一种英雄气概来了，在这前面，那发源于迟钝的血液循环的德国人的萎靡不振的忍耐，就缩得一无所有。乞乞科夫的血液，却是火一般在脉管里流行的，倘要驾御一切要从这里奔迸出来，自由活动的欲望，必须有坚强的，明晰的意志。他这样那样的反省了许多时，而且总反省出一些正当。为什么我竟这样子？为什么现在不幸应该闯到我的头上来？那么，现在谁得了职业？人都在图谋好处。我没有陷害过什么人，没有抢掠过一个寡妇，没有弄得谁去做乞丐，我不过取了一点余剩，别人站在我的地位上，也要伸下手去的。我不趁这机会揩点油，别人也要来揩的。为什么别人可以称心享福？为什么我却应该蛆虫似的烂掉？我现在是什么东西？我还有什么用处？我现在怎么和一个体面的一家之父见面呢？如果我一想到空活在这世界上，能不觉得良心的苛责吗？而且将来我的孩子们会怎么说呢？——“看我们的父亲罢，”他们会说，“他是一只猪，毫不留给我们一点财产。”

我们已经知道，乞乞科夫是很担心着他的后代的。这是一件发痒似的事情。假使嘴唇上不常涌出这奇特的，渺茫的“我的孩子们会怎么说呢？”的问题来，许多人就未必这么深的去捞别人的袋子了。未来的一家之父却赶忙去捞一切手头的东西，恰如一匹谨慎的雄猫，惴惴的斜视着两边，看主人可在近地：只要看到一块肥皂，一枝蜡烛，一片脂肪，爪下的一只金丝雀，他就全都抓来，什么也不放过。我们的主角在这么的慨叹和诉苦，但他的头却不断的在用功。他固执的要想出一些什么来；只还缺新建设的计画。他又缩小了，他又开始辛苦的工作生活，他又无不省俭，他又下了高尚的和纯净的天，掉在龌龊和困苦的存在里了。在等候着好机会之间，总算得了法院代书人的职务，这职业者，在我们这里是还没有争得公民资格，非忍受各方面的打和推不可，被法院小官和他们的上司所轻蔑，判定了候在房外，并挨各种欺侮呵斥的苦恼的。然而艰难使我们的主角炼成一切的本领。在他所委托执行的许多公务中，也有这样的一件事：是有几百个农奴到救济局里来做抵押。那些农奴所属的土地，已经成为荒场。可怕的家畜传染病，奸恶经理人的舞弊，送掉顶好的农奴的时疫，坏收成，以及地主的不小的胡涂，都使这成为不毛之地。主人往莫斯科造起时髦房子来，装饰的最新式，最适意，但却把他的财产化得不剩一文钱，至于连吃也不容易。于是他只好把还剩在他手里的惟一的田地，拿去做抵押了。向国家抵押的事，当时还不很明白，而且试办未久，所以要决定这一步，总不免心怀一点疑惧。乞乞科夫以代书人的资格，先来准备下一切；他首先是博得所有在场人的欢心（没有这豫先的调度，谁都知道是连简单的讯问也轮不到的——总得每人有一瓶玛兑拉酒才好），待到确实的笼络住了所有官员之后，他才告诉他们说：这事件里还有一点必须注意的情形：“农奴的一半是已经死掉了的，要防后来会有什么申诉……”——“但他们是还写在户口调查册上的罢，不是吗？”秘书官说。“自然。”乞乞科夫回答道。——“那么，你还怕什么呢？”秘书官道。“这一个死掉，别一个会生，并无失少呀，这么样就成。”谁都看见，这位秘书官是能够用诗来说话的。但在我们的主角的头里，却闪出一个人所能想到的最天才的思想来了。“唉，我这老实人！”他对自己说。“我在找我的手套，它却就塞在自己的腰带上！趁新的人口调查册还没有造好之前，我去买了所有死掉了的人们来；一下子弄它一千个，于是到救济局里去抵押；那么，每个魂灵我就有二百卢布，目前足可以弄到二十万卢布了！而且现在恰是最好的时机，时疫正在流行，靠上帝，送命的很不少！地主们输光了他的钱，到处游荡，把财产化得一点不剩，都想往彼得堡去做官：抛下田地，经理人又不很帮他们，收租也逐年的难起来；单是用不着再付人头税，就不知道他们多么愿意把死掉的魂灵让给我呢，唔，恐怕我到底只要化一两个戈贝克就什么都拿来了。这自然是不容易的，要费许多力，人只好永远在苦海里漂泛，掉下去，又从此造出新的历史来。然而人究竟为什么要他的聪明呢？所谓好事情，就是很不真实，没有人真肯相信的事情。自然，不连田地，是不能买，也不能押的；但我用移住的目的去买，自然，移住的目的；滔律支省和赫尔生省的荒地，现在几乎可以不化钱的去领；那地方你就可以移民的，心里想多少就多少！我简直送他们到那地方去：到赫尔生省去；使他们住下！移民是要履行法律的程序，遵照设定的条文，经过裁决的。如果他们要证明书，可以，我不反对。为什么不可以？我也能拿出一个地方审判厅长亲笔署名的证明书来的。这田地，就叫作‘乞乞科夫庄’，或者用我的本名，称为‘保甫尔村’罢。”在我们的主角的头里建设了这奇特的计画，读者对于这，是否十分感谢呢，我毫不知道，但作者却觉得应该不可以言语形容的感谢的；无论如何，假使乞乞科夫没有发生这思想——这诗篇也不会看见世界的光了。

他依照俄国的习惯，画过一个十字之后，要实行他的大计画了。他要撒着谎，他是在找寻一块可以住下的小地方，还用许多另外的口实，到我们国度里的边疆僻壤去察看，尤其是比别处蒙着更多的灾害之处，就是：荒歉，死亡以及别的种种。一言以蔽之，是给他极好的机会，十分便宜的买到他所需要的农奴的地方。他决不随便去找任何的地主，却从他的口味来挑选人，这就是，须是和他做成这一种交易，不会怎样的棘手。他先设法去和他接近，赚得他的交情，使农奴可以白白的送他，自己无须破费。在我们这故事的进行中，出现的人物虽然总不合他的口味，但读者却也不能嗔怪作者的：这是乞乞科夫的错；因为这里他是局面的主人公，他想往那里去，我们也只好跟着他，如果有人加以责备，说我们的人物和性格都模胡，轻淡，那么，我们这一面也只能总是反复的说，在一件事情的开初，是不能测度它的全部情状，以及经过的广和深的。坐车到一个都会去，即使是繁华的首都，也往往毫无趣味。先是什么都显得灰色，单调。无边际的工厂和熏黑的作场干燥无味的屹立着。稍迟就出现了六层楼房的屋角，体面的店铺，挂着的招牌，街道的长行和钟楼，圆柱，雕像，教堂，还有街上的喧嚣和灿烂，以及人的手和人的精神所创造的奇迹。第一回的购买是怎样的成交，读者已经看见了；这事件怎样地展开，怎样的成功和失败等候着我们的主角，他怎样地打胜和克服更其艰难的障碍，还有是强大的形象怎样地在我们前面开步，极其秘密的杠杆怎样地使我们这泛滥很广的故事运行，水平线怎样地激荡起来，于是迸为堂皇的抒情诗的洪流呢，我们到后来就看见。一位中年的绅士，一辆年青独身者常坐的马车，跟丁彼得尔希加，马夫绥里方和驾车的三头骏马，从议员到卑劣的花马，是我们已经绍介过了的，由这些编成的我们的旅团，要走的是一条远路。于此就可见我们的主角的生涯。但也许大家还希望我用最后的一笔，描出性格来罢：从他的德行方面说起来，他是怎样的人呢？他并不是具备一切道德，优长，以及无不完善的英雄——那是明明白白的。他究竟是怎样的人？那就是一个恶棍了罢？为什么立刻就是一个恶棍？对于别人，我们又何必这么严厉呢？我们这里，现在是已经没有恶棍的了。有的是仁善的，坚定的，和气的人，不过对于公然的侮辱，肯献出他的脸相来迎接颊上的一击的，却还是少得很。这一种类，我们只能找出两三个，他们自然立刻高声的谈起道德来。最确切是称他为好掌柜或是得利的天才。得利的欲望——是罪魁祸首，它就是世间称为“不很干净”的一切关系和事务的原因。自然，这样的性格，是有一点招人反感的，就是读者，即使在自己的一生中，和这样的人打交道，引他到自己的家里来，和他消遣过许多愉快的时间，但一在什么戏曲里，或者一篇诗歌里遇见，却就疑忌的向他看。然而什么性格都不畏惮，倒放出考察的眼光，来把握他那最内部的欲望的弹簧的人，是聪明，聪明，第三个聪明的；在人，什么都变化得很迅速；一瞬息间，内部就有可怕的虫蛆做了窠，不住的生长起来，把所有的生活力吸得干干净净。还有已经不只发现过一回的，是一个人系出高门，不但是剧烈的热情生长得很强盛，倒往往因为一种可怜的渺小的欲望，忘却了崇高的神圣的义务，向无聊的空虚里，去找伟大和尊荣了。像海中沙的，是人的热情，彼此无一相像，开初是无不柔顺，听命于人的，高超的也如卑俗的一样，但后来却成为可怕的暴君。恭喜的是从中选取最美的热情的人：他的无边的幸福逐日逐时的生长起来，愈进愈深的他进了他的魂灵的无际的天国。然而也有并不由人挑选的热情。这是和人一同出世的，却没有能够推开它的力量。它所驱使的是最高的计画，有一点东西含在这里面，在人的一生中决不暂时沉默，总在叫唤和招呼。使下界的大竞走场至于完成，乃是它的目的，无论它以朦胧的姿态游行，或者以使全世界发大欢呼的辉煌的现象，在我们面前经过——完全一样——它的到来，是为了给人以未知之善的。在驱使和催促我们的主角乞乞科夫的，大约也是发源于热情的罢，这非出于他自己，是伏在他的冰冷的生涯中，将来要令人向上天的智慧曲膝，而且微如尘沙的。至于这形象，为什么不就在目下已经出世的这诗篇里出现呢，却还是一个秘密。

但大家不满足于我们的主角，并不是苦楚；更其苦楚和伤心的倒是这：我的魂灵里生活着推不开的确信，是无论如何，读者竟会满足于这主角，满足于就是这一个乞乞科夫的。如果作者不去洞察他的心，如果他不去搅起那瞒着人眼，遮盖起来的，活在他的魂灵的最底里的一切，如果他不去揭破那谁也不肯对人明说的，他的秘密的心思，却只写得他像全市镇里，玛尼罗夫以及所有别的人们——那样子——那么，大家就会非常满足，谁都把他当作一个很有意思的人物的罢。不过他的姿态和形象，也就当然不会那么活泼的在我们眼前出现：因此也没有什么感动，事后还在振撼我们的魂灵，我们只要一放下书本，就又可以安详的坐到那全俄之乐的我们的打牌桌子前面去了。是的，我的体面的读者，你们是不喜欢看人的精赤条条的可怜相的：“看什么呢？”你们说。“这些有什么用呢？难道我们自己不知道世界上有很多的卑鄙和胡涂吗？即使没有这书，人也常常看见无法自慰的物事的。还是给我们看看惊心动魄的美丽的东西罢！来帮帮我们，还是使我们忘记自己罢！”——“为什么你要来告诉我，说我的经济不行的呀，弟兄？”一个地主对他的管家说。“没有你，我也明白，好朋友；你就竟不会谈谈什么别的了吗？是不是？还是帮我忘记一切，不要想到它的好——那么，我就幸福了。”钱也一样，是用它来经营田地的，却为了忘却自己，用各种手段化掉。连也许能够忽然发见大富源的精神，也睡了觉了；他的田地拍卖了，地主为了忘却自己，只好去乞食；带着一个原是出奇的下贱和庸俗，连自己看见也要大吃一吓的魂灵。

对于作者，还有一种别样的申斥；这是出于所谓爱国者的，他们幽闲的坐在自己的窠里，做着随随便便的事情，在别人的粮食上，抽着好签子，积起了一批财产；然而一有从他们看起来，以为是辱没祖国的东西，即使不过是包含着苦口的真实的什么书一出版——他们也就像蜘蛛的发见一个苍蝇兜在他们的网上了的一般，从各处的角角落落里爬出来，扬起一种大声的叫喊道：“唔，把这样的物事发表出来，公然叙述，这是好的吗？写在这里的，确是我们的事——但这么办，算得聪明吗？况且外国人会怎么说呢？听别人说我们坏，觉得舒服吗？”而且他们想：这于我们有没有损呢？想：我们岂不是爱国者吗？对于这样的警告，尤其是关于外国人，我找不出适当的回答。有一件这样的事：在俄国的什么偏僻之处，曾经生活着两个人。其一，是一个大家族的父亲，叫作吉法·摩基维支；他是温和，平静的人，只爱舒适和幽闲的生活。他不大过问家务；他的生涯，倒是献给思索的居多，他沉潜于“哲学的问题”，照他自己说。“拿走兽来做例子罢。”他时常说，一面在房里走来走去。“走兽是完全精赤条条的生下来的。为什么竟是精赤条条？为什么不像飞禽似的再多一些毛？为什么它，譬如说，不从蛋壳里爬出来的？唉唉，真的，奇怪得很……人研究自然越深，就知道得越少！”市民吉法·摩基维支这样想。然而这还不是最关紧要的。别一位市民是摩基·吉法维支，他的亲生的儿子。他是一个俄国一般之所谓英雄，当那父亲正在研究走兽的产生的时候，他那二十来岁的广肩阔背的身体，却以全力在倾注于发展和生长。无论什么事，他不能轻易的，照常的就完——总是折断了谁的臂膊，或者给鼻子上肿起一大块。在家里或在邻近，只要一望见他，一切——从家里的使女起一直到狗——全都逃跑，连在他卧房里的自己的眠床，他也捣成了碎片。这样的是摩基·吉法维支，除此之外，他却是一个善良的好心的人物。但这并不是重要的。重要的是在这里：“我告诉你，吉法·摩基维支老爷，”自家的和别人的使女和家丁都来对父亲说，“你那摩基·吉法维支是怎样的一位少爷呀？他给谁都安静不来，太捣乱了！”——“对的，对的，他真也有些胡闹，”那父亲总是这么回答着，“但有什么办法呢？打他是已经不行的了，大家就都要说我严厉和苛刻，他却是一个爱面子的人；如果我在别人面前申斥他呢——他一定会小心的；但也忘不了当场丢脸——这就着实可怜。市里一知道，他们是要立刻叫他畜生的。你们以为我不会觉得苦痛的吗？你们以为我在研究哲学，再没有别的工夫，就不是他的父亲了吗？那里的话，你们弄错了。我是父亲呀，是的，我是父亲呀，妈的会不是。摩基·吉法维支——是深深的藏在我这里的心里的。”吉法·摩基维支用拳头使劲的捶着胸膛，非常愤激了：“即使他一世总是一匹畜生，至少，从我的嘴里是总不会说出来的；我可不能自己来给他丢脸！”他这样的发挥了父亲的感情之后，是一任摩基·吉法维支仍旧做着他的英雄事业，自己却回到他心爱的对象去，其间忽然提出这样的问题来了：“哼，如果像是生蛋的，那蛋壳应该不至于厚到没有什么炮弹打得碎罢？唉，唉，现在是到了发明一种新火器的时候了！”我们的两位居民，就是这样的在平安的地角里过活，他们，在我们这诗篇的完结之处，突然好像从一个窗口来窥探了一下，为的是对于热烈的爱国者的申斥，给一个平稳的回答，他们爱国者，就大概是一向静静的研究着哲学，或者他们所热爱的祖国的富的增加，不管做着坏事情，却只怕有人说出做着坏事情来的。然而爱国主义和上述的感情，也并不是这一切责备和申斥的原因。还有完全两样的东西藏在那里面。我为什么该守秘密呢？除了作者，谁还有这义务，来宣告神圣的真实呢？你们怕深刻的，探究的眼光射到你们的身上来。你们不敢自己用这眼光来看对象，你们喜欢瞎了眼睛，毫不思索，在一切之前溜过。你们也许在心里嗤笑乞乞科夫；也许竟在称赞作者，说：“然而，许多事情，他实在也观察得很精细！该是一个性情快活的人罢！”这话之后，你们就以加倍的骄傲，回到自己的本来，脸上显出一种很自负的微笑，接下去道：“人可是应该说，在俄国的一两个地方，确有非常特别和可笑的人的，其中也还有实在精炼的恶棍！”不过你们里面，可有谁怀着基督教的谦虚，不高声，不明说，只在万籁俱寂，魂灵孤独的自言自语的一瞬息间，在内部的深处，提一个问题来道：“怎么样？我这里恐怕也含有一点乞乞科夫气罢？”怎么会一点也没有。假如迎面走过了一个官，是中等品级的汉子——他就会立刻触一触他的邻人，几乎要笑了出来的样子，告诉他道：“看呀，看呀，这是乞乞科夫，他走过去了！”他还会忘记了和自己的身分和年龄相当的礼仪，孩子似的跟住他，嘲笑他，愚弄他，并且在他后面叫喊道：“乞乞科夫！乞乞科夫！乞乞科夫！”

然而我们话讲的太响，竟全没有留心到我们的主角在讲他一生的故事时睡得很熟，现在却已经醒来，而且要隐约的听到有谁屡次的叫着他的姓氏了。他这人，是很容易生气，如果毫不客气的在讲他，也是极不高兴的。得罪了乞乞科夫没有，读者自然觉得并无关系；但作者却相反，无论如何，他总不能和他的主角闹散的：他还有许多路，要和他携手同行；还有两大部诗，摆在自己的前面，而且这实在也不是小事情。

“喂，喂！你在闹什么了！”乞乞科夫向绥里方叫喊道。“你……？”

“什么呀？”绥里方慢吞吞的问。

“什么呀？你问！你这昏蛋！这是什么走法？前去，上紧！”

实在的，缓里方坐在他的马夫台上，久已迷蒙着眼睛了。他不过在半醒半睡中，间或用缰绳轻轻的敲着也在睡觉的马的背脊。彼得尔希加也不知道在什么地方落掉了帽子，反身向后，把头搁在乞乞科夫的膝髁上，吃了主人的许多有力的敲击。绥里方鼓起勇气来，在花马上使劲的抽上一两鞭，马就跑开了活泼的步子；于是他使鞭子在马背脊上呼呼发响，用了尖细的声音，唱歌似的叱咤道：“不怕就是了！”马匹奋迅起来，曳着轻车，羽毛似的前进。绥里方单是挥着鞭子，叫道：“吓，吓，吓！”一面在他的马夫台上很有规律的颠来簸去，车子就在散在公路上的山谷上飞驰。乞乞科夫靠在垫子上，略略欠起一点身子来，愉快的微笑着！因为他是喜欢疾走的。那一个俄国人不喜欢疾走呢？他的魂灵，无时无地不神往于懵腾和颠倒，而且时常要高声的叫出“管他妈的”来，他的魂灵会不喜欢疾走吗？倘有其中含着一点很神妙，很感幸的东西，他会不喜欢吗？好像一种不知的伟力，把你载在它的翼子上，你飞去了，周围的一切也和你一同飞去了：路标，坐在车上的商人，两旁的种着幽暗的松树和枞树，听到斧声和鸦鸣的树林，很长的道路，都飞过去了——远远的去在不可知的远地里；而在这飞速的闪烁和动荡中，却含有一种恐怖，可怕，一切飞逝的对象，都没有看清模样的工夫，只有我们头上的天，淡淡的云，上升的月亮，却好像不动的静静的站着。我的三驾马车呵，唉唉，我的鸟儿三驾马车呵！是谁发明了你的呢？你是只从大胆的，勇敢的国民里，这才生得出来的——在不爱玩笑，却如无边的平野一般，展布在半个地球之上的那个国度里：试去数一数路标罢，可不要闪花了眼睛！真的，你不是用铁攀来钩连起来的，乖巧的弄成的车子。却是迅速地，随随便便地，单单用了斧凿，一个敏捷的耶罗斯拉夫的农人做你成功的。驾驶你的马夫并不穿德国的长统靴，他蓬着胡子，戴着手套，坐着，鬼知道是在什么上；他一站起，挥动他的鞭子，唱起他的无穷尽的歌来——马就旋风似的飞跑。车轴闪成一枚圆圆的平板。道路隆隆鸣动。行路人吓得发喊，站下来仿佛生了根。——车子飞过去了，飞呀飞呀！……只看见在远地里好像一阵浓密的烟云，后面旋转着空气。

你不是也在飞跑，俄国呵，好像大胆的，总是追不着的三驾马车吗？地面在你底下扬尘；桥在发吼。一切都留在你后面了，远远的留在你后面。被上帝的奇迹所震悚似的，吃惊的旁观者站了下来。这是出自云间的闪电吗？这令人恐怖的动作，是什么意义？而且在这世所未见的马里，是蓄着怎样的不可思议的力量的呢？唉唉，你们马呵！你们神奇的马呵！有旋风住在你们的鬃毛上面吗？在每条血管里，都颤动着一只留神的耳朵吗？你们倾听了头上的心爱的，熟识的歌，现在就一致的挺出你们这黄铜的胸脯的吗？你们几乎蹄不点地，把身子伸成一线，飞过空中，狂奔而去，简直像是得了神助！……俄国呵！你奔到那里去给一个回答罢！你一声也不响。奇妙地响着铃子的歌。好像被风所搅碎似的，空气在咆哮，在凝结；超过了凡在地上生活和动弹的一切，涌过去了；所有别的国度和国民，都对你退避，闪在一旁，让给你道路。

一　《死魂灵》第一部第二版序文


一八四六年





作者告读者


无论你是怎样的人，亲爱的读者，无论你居于怎样的地位，任着怎样的官职，不问你是有着品级和勋位，是一个普通身分的平常人，倘由上帝授以读书识字的珍贵之赐，又因偶然的机缘，手里玩着这本书，那么，我请你帮助我。

在你面前的书，大约你也已经看过那第一版，是描写着从俄国中间提了出来的人的。他在我们这俄罗斯的祖国旅行，遇见了许多种类，各样身分，高贵的和普通的人物。他从中选择主角，在显示俄国人的恶德和缺失之点，比特长和美德还要多；而环绕他周围的一切人，也选取其照见我们的缺点和弱点，好的人物和性格，是要到第二部里这才提出的。这书里面所叙述的，有许多不确之处，而在俄罗斯祖国所实现的事物，也并不如此，这是因为我实在没有能够深通一切的缘故。尽一生之力，来研究我们的故乡的现状，就是百分之一也还是做不到的。加以还会有我自己的草率，生疏和匆促，混入许多错误和妄断，至使这书的每一页上，无不应加若干的修改，所以我恳求你，亲爱的读者，请赐我以指正。你不可轻视这劳力。纵使你的教养和生活是怎样的高超，并且觉得我的书是怎样的轻微和不足道，加以订正和指点，在你是怎样的琐细和无聊，我却还是恳求你，请你做一下。但是还有你，亲爱的读者，就是平常的教养和普通的身分，也不要以为一无所知，就不来教导我。每一个人，只要生在世间，见过世界，遇着过许多人，即一定会看出许多别人之所失察，懂得许多别人之所不知。所以我不愿意放弃你的指导。只要你细心的看过一遍，对于我的书的什么地方会没有话要说，这是决不至于的。

假如罢，只要人们中有一个人，知识广博，经验丰富，熟悉我们描写的人们的地位，记下他对于全书的指示来，而且阅读之际，仅有手里一枝笔和他放在面前的桌上一张纸，这是多么的好呢。如果他每回读完一两页之后，就一想他一生的经历，他所遭遇的一切人，他所目睹的一切事，以及他所亲见亲闻的种种，看和描写在我的书中的事件是否相像，或者简直相反——而且如果他细细写下他的记忆来，寄给我每张写满的纸，这样的一直到读完了全书，这又是多么的好呢。他给了我怎样的一个很大的实惠呢。文章的风格和词藻是不必介意的：这里所处置的只在事情本身和它的真实，并不是为了风格。如果加我指摘，给我谴责，或者要置之危险，使我毁伤，说我做了一件事情的误谬的叙述，也都用不着顾忌，但愿有用和改善，乃是我真正的目的。对于这一切，我是统统真心感谢的。

更好的事，是如果有一个地位很高的人，那各种关系——从生活以至教养——都和我的书中所描写的地位相差甚远，然而明白他自己所属的地位的生活，而且这样的人肯打定主意，一样的把我的书从头看起，使一切地位很高的人们在他精神的眼目之前一一经过，并且严密的注意，看各种地位不同的人们中是否有一点什么相通的东西，看大抵出现于下等社会中者，是否也有时再见于上流社会；并且把想到的一切，就是把出于上流社会的各种事故，和拥护或排斥相关的这思想，写得十分详细，恰如他所观察一样，不忘记人物本身和他的脾气，嗜好和习惯，也不放过他们周围的无生物，从衣服起，下至器具以及他们所住的房屋的墙。我必须知道代表着国民的精华的这上流社会。在我明白了俄国的各方面的生活之前，至少，在具备了我的作品所必要的分量之前，我是不能把我那作品的末一部发表出去的。

这也不坏，如果有一个人，具备着丰富的幻想和才能，活泼的想象着一切人间的关系，并且到处从各种生活状态上来观察人——一句话，就是如果有一个人，知道深入他所阅读的作者的精神，或者引申和开拓他的思想——把见于我的书中的各人物，细心的追究下去，还肯告诉我在这种或那种景况中，他们应该怎样的举动，从开端来加推断，在故事的进行中他该有怎样的遭遇，由此能够际会到怎样一种新的情形，以及我还应该把什么添在我的著作里；凡此一切，到我的书印成一本新的，较好和较出色的本子，显在读者面前的时候，我都要郑重的加以考虑的。

还有一件，是我真心的恳求那肯以他的指点，使我欣悦的人：他写起文字来，不要以为写的是给和自己有同等的教养，和自己有一样的趣味和一样的思想，许多事情是不必详说也会了然的人去看的文字；倒要请他写得好像是给教养全不能和自己相比，几乎毫无知识的人去看似的。如果他不算写给我，却当作写给一个一生都过在那里的，穷乡僻壤的野人，那就更其好，对于这等人，倘要说明一点小事情，使他懂得，略有印象，是几乎像对孩子一样，用不着出于他的程度之上的言语的。如果谁都把这一点永是放在心中，如果谁准备写给我关于我的书的指示，永是把这一点放在心中，则这指示之有意思和有价值，还在他自己之所意料以上；他给我一个很大的实惠了。

如果我的读者肯顾全和充满我的真心的希望，如果其中真有一两个人秉着非常的好意，要回答我的恳求，那么，可以用这方法把你的指示寄给我：把写着我的地址姓名的封筒，套在另一个封筒里，寄给下列的人们：圣彼得堡大学校长彼得·亚历山特洛维支·普来德纳夫大人收（地址是圣彼得堡大学）或者莫斯科大学教授斯台班·彼得洛维支·绥惠略夫先生收（地址是莫斯科大学），看那一处和寄信人相近。

临末，对于批评和议论我这书的记者和作家全体，还要声明我的率直的感谢；虽有不少天然的过份和夸张，但给我的心和精神，却指示了很大的决断和益处，所以我恳求他们这回也不要放下他们的批评。我可以豫先坦白的说，只要是给我启发和教导，我全都很感激的接受的。





二　关于第一部的省察


市镇的观念——他们的现状的极度的空虚。出于一切范围之外的闲谈和密告。这些一切，怎样地从闲暇发生，演成最高度的笑柄，以及原是聪明的人，怎样地终于弄到犯了很大的愚蠢。

闺秀们的会话的细目。怎样地在一般的闲谈里，又夹进私心的闲谈去，以及于是怎样地不再宽恕别人。风闻和猜测怎样地造成。这猜测怎样地达到滑稽的极顶。大家怎样地不知不觉的来参加这闲谈，以及绣鞋英雄和娘儿奴才(1)怎样地造就。

生活的虚脱，安逸和空虚，怎样地由幽暗的，一言不发的死来替换。这可怕的事件怎样地木然的进来而且过去。什么也不动。死来恐吓这完全不动的生活。对于读者，却应该使生活的死一般的麻木，见得更其可怕。

生活的怕人的昏暗揭去了，其中藏着一种深的神秘。这岂不是有些很可怕吗？这人立而跳的，捣乱的，闲暇的生活——岂不是一个现象，由可怕的伟大而来的吗？……生活！……在跳舞装，在燕尾服，在谈闲天和交换名片的地方——没有一个人相信死……

细目。闺秀们立刻因此争吵起来，因为这一个愿意乞乞科夫是这样，而别一个却同时希望他有些那样——所以她们就只采取些合于自己的理想的风闻。

别的闺秀们登场。

通体漂亮的太太有一种偏于物欲的脾气，而且爱说她有时怎样地仗着自己的理性之助，来克服这脾气，以及她怎样地懂得和男人们保着若干的距离。但也真的出过这事情，而且用着很单纯的方法。没有一个人近得她，那简单的缘由，是因为她在年青时代已经和一个守夜人有过很相类似的事情，虽然她这么漂亮，还有一切她的好性质。——“唉唉，我的亲爱的，您知道，先把一个男人引一下，于是推开他，于是再去引一下，我觉得可很好玩呢。”在跳舞会里，她也这样的来处置乞乞科夫。别人都以为自己也应该这么办。有一位走得很规矩。有两位闺秀是挽着臂膊，走来走去，竭力引长了声音笑起来。于是她们忽然发见乞乞科夫不成样子了。

通体漂亮的太太爱读关于跳舞会的记载。维也纳的集会的记事她也觉得很有味。此外是这位闺秀很留心于打扮，这就是说，她喜欢查考别的闺秀们，那打扮好，还是坏。

当她们坐在椅子上的时候，就观察着进来的人们。“N简直全不知道打扮，真的，她不知道。那围巾是和她一点也不相称的。”——“知事的女儿穿的多么出色呵。”——“但是，亲爱的，她可是穿的不像样呀。”——如果真的这样子——

全市镇乱七八糟的纵横交错着闲谈和密告——这是他们一群中的人生的安逸和空虚的本相。到处是胡说白道，大家只是竭力的和这联成一气。跳舞会的要点。

第二部中的反对的本相，着力在打破和撕裂的安逸。

怎样地才能够把全世界的安逸和闲暇的一切玩艺拉下来，到市镇的闲暇的一种，怎样地才能够把市镇的闲暇提上去，到全世界的安逸和闲暇的本相。

这必须总括一切类似的特征，也必须在故事里有一个切实的继续。





三　第九章结末的改定稿


他们想了一通，终于决定去问那和乞乞科夫交易，他买了这疑问的死魂灵去的出主。检事所得的差使，是访梭巴开维支去，并且和他谈谈，审判厅长却自愿到科罗皤契加那里去。我们也还是一同起身，跟着他们去看看，他们在那里究竟打听了些什么罢。





第……章


梭巴开维支和他的夫人住在一所离嚣尘较远的屋子里。他选定了造得很坚固的房屋，用不着怕屋顶要从头上落下来，可以舒适幸福的过活。这屋子的主人是一个商人，叫作科罗蒂尔庚，也是一位很茁实的汉子。梭巴开维支只同了他的女人来，孩子们却没有带在一起。他已经觉得无聊，快要回去了，只还等着这市里的三个居民向他租来种萝卜的一块地皮的租钱，以及他的女人向裁缝师定下，立刻可以做好的一件时式的棉衣服。他早已有些不耐烦，坐在靠椅里，不断的骂着别人的欺骗和胡闹，一面那眼光却避开了他的夫人，看着火炉角。正在这时候，检事走进屋子里来了。梭巴开维支说一声“请”，略略一站，就又坐了下去。检事走向菲杜略·伊凡诺夫娜，在她的手上接过吻，也立刻坐在一把椅子上。菲杜略·伊凡诺夫娜受了吻手之后，也在一把椅子上坐下了。三把椅子都油着绿釉，角上描着黄色的睡莲，是外行人的乱涂乱画。

“我这来，是为了要和您谈一件重要的事情。”检事说。

“心肝，回你的房里去罢！恐怕女裁缝正在等你呢。”

菲杜略走到自己的房里去了。

检事开始了这样的话：“请您允许我问一问：你把怎样的农奴卖给保甫尔·伊凡诺维支·乞乞科夫了？”

“您在说什么呀：怎样的农奴？”梭巴开维支说。“我们立过买卖契约的；是些怎样的人，都写在那上面，一个是木匠……”

“但市里却流传着……”检事有些惶窘了，说……“市里却流传着风闻呢……”

“市里昏蛋太多，总会造出一些风闻来的。”梭巴开维支安静的说。

“不的，不的，米哈尔·绥米诺维支，这是很特别的风闻，令人要胡涂起来的，说的是买卖的全不是农奴，也并非为了移住，而且人们说，这乞乞科夫就是一个简直是谜一样的人物。于是起了极可疑的猜测，市里只在说这一件事……”

“请您允许我问一问：你莫非是一个老婆子吗？”梭巴开维支问道。

这问题使检事狼狈之至。他是还没有自问过，他是老婆子呢，还是什么别的东西的。

“您提出这样的问题，还要到我这里来，是在侮辱我呀。”梭巴开维支接着说。

检事吃吃的认了几句错。

“您还是到那些坐在纺线机后面，夜里讲着鬼怪和魔女的吓人故事的饶舌婆子那里去罢。如果您不想靠上帝帮助，想出点好的来，那您还不如和孩子们玩掷骨游戏去。您怎么竟来搅扰一个正经人呢？莫非您当我是爱开玩笑的，还是什么吗？您竟不大留心您的职务，也不大想给祖国出力，给您的邻人得益，爱护您的同僚呀。只要有什么一匹驴子推您到什么地方去，您总想是首先第一，立刻跑出来。留心些罢，您会一回一回的枉然堕落下去，什么好纪念也不留一点，不像样子的完结的。”

检事大碰了一个钉子，竟毫不知道应该怎么回答这道德的教训了。他受着侮辱和轻蔑，离开了梭巴开维支。但主人还在背后叫喊道：“滚你的罢，你这狗！”

这时候进来了菲杜略。“检事为什么马上就走了呢？”她问。

“这东西起了后悔，跑掉了。”梭巴开维支说。“你在这里就又看见了一个例子，心肝。这样的一个老少年！已经有白头发了，但我知道，他却还是总不给别人的太太们得一点安静。这些人都是这一类：他们彼此统统是狗子。亲爱的大地背着他们的安闲，还不够受吗，他们是应该统统塞在一只袋子里，抛到水里面去的！全市镇就是一个强盗窠。我们在这里已经没有什么好找。我们要回家去了。”

梭巴开维支太太还要抗议，说她的衣服还没有做好，而且她还得买一两个庆祝日所用的头巾上的带结，但梭巴开维支却开导道：“这都是摩登货，心肝；后来还有坏处的。”他命令准备启程；自己和一个巡官到市上的三个居民那里，收了种萝卜的地租，又绕到女裁缝家，取回那未曾完工，还要再做的衣服，连针线都在内，以便回家后可以做好，于是立刻离开市镇了。在路上他不住的反复着说，到这市镇里来，简直是危险的事，因为这里是这一个恶棍和骗子坐在别一个恶棍和骗子头上的地方，而且也容易和他们一同陷在大泥塘里的。

别一面，检事对于梭巴开维支为他而设的款待，也狼狈得非常。他很迷惑，至于想不明白应该怎样向审判厅长去报告他的访问的结果。

然而关于事件的解释，审判厅长所得的也不多。他先坐着自己的车子到得镇上，由此跑进一条又狭又脏的小巷去，在一路上，车轮总是左左右右的高低不定。先是他的下巴和后脑壳很沉重的撞在自己的手杖上，并且衣服都溅满了泥污。车子啧啧的发着响，摇摆着，在泥泞中进行，终于到了住持长老的处所，在这里先受着接连不断的活泼的猪叫的欢迎。他叫停车，步行着经过各种堆房和小屋，到了大门口。在这里他先借一块毛巾，揩了一回脸。科罗皤契加全像对乞乞科夫一样的来迎接他，脸上也显着那一种阴郁的表情。她颈子上围着一条好像法兰绒布似的东西，屋子里飞鸣着无数队的苍蝇，桌子上摆着难以指名的食饵，分明是药它们的，然而它们似乎也已经习惯了。科罗皤契加请他坐。

厅长先从自己和她的男人相识谈起，于是突然转到这问题：“请您告诉我，这是真的吗，新近有一个人拿着手枪，夜里跑到您这里来，威吓着您，说是如果不肯把鬼知道什么魂灵卖给他，他就要谋害您了？您可以告诉我们，他究竟是怀着什么目的吗？”

“当然，我怎么不可以呢！请您站在我的位置上来想一想：二十五卢布的票子！我实在不明白，我是寡妇，什么也不懂得；要骗我是很容易的，况且又是一件我一向不知道的事情，先生。大麻值什么价钱，我知道，脂油我也卖过的，还有前……”

“不不，请您详细的讲一讲。那是怎样的呢。他真的拿着一枝手枪吗？”

“没有的，先生。靠上帝保佑，手枪我可没有见。可是我不过是一个寡妇——我实在不能知道，死魂灵该值多少钱。对不对，先生，请您照顾一下，告诉我罢，给我好知道一个真实的价钱。”

“什么一个价钱？什么一个价钱吗，太太？您说的是什么的价钱呀？”

“死魂灵的价钱呀，先生！”

“她生得呆，还是发了疯呢？”厅长想，一面注视着她的脸。

“二十五卢布？我实在不知道，也许要值到五十卢布呢，或者竟还要多。”

“请您把钞票给我看一看。”厅长说，并且向光去一照，查考这是否假造的。然而是一张完全平常的真钞票。

“但是您只要讲这交易怎么一个情形，他从您这里究竟买了什么就是。我还不明白……我简直一点也不懂……”

“他确是从我这里买了这去的，”科罗皤契加说，“然而您为什么总不肯告诉我，死魂灵要值多少，给我好知道他真实的价钱呢。”

“请您原谅，您在说什么呀？有谁听到过卖死魂灵的吗？”

“为什么您简直不肯告诉我价钱呢？”

“那里的话，价钱！请您原谅，这怎么能讲到价钱呢？还是老实的告诉我罢，这事情是怎样的。他用什么威吓了您吗？他想来引诱您吗？”

“没有的事，先生，您讲的是什么！……现在我看起来，您也是一个商人。”——于是她猜疑的看着他的眼。

“唉唉，那里的话！我是审判厅长呀，太太！”

“不不，先生，您要怎么说，说就是，您一定也想……您也有这目的……来骗我的。不过这于您有什么好处呢？您只会得到坏处的。我很愿意卖给您绒毛；一到复活节，我就有出色的绒毛了。”

“太太！我对您说，我是审判厅长。我拿您的绒毛做什么呢，您自己说罢！我什么也不要买。”

“不过这倒是完全合于基督教的事情，先生，”科罗皤契加接着说，“今天我卖点什么给您，明天您卖点什么给我。您瞧，如果我们彼此你骗我，我骗你，那里还有正义呢？对于上帝，这是一件罪业呀！”

“不过我可并不是做买卖的，太太，我是审判厅长！”

“上帝知道，也许您真的是审判厅长。我可是知不清。那又怎么呢？我是一个孤苦零丁的寡妇！您为什么要问我这些呢？唔，先生，据我看来，您自己……也是……要买这东西的。”

“太太，我劝您去看一看医生，”审判厅长气恼的说，“您的这地方，好像实在很不清楚了。”——他一面用手指向自己的前额一指，一面接着说。和这话同时，他也就站起身来，走了出去了。

科罗皤契加却站着没有动，还像她一向的对付商人一样，不过看得这些人现在竟这么的不和气，会发恼了，很觉得稀奇，而且一个孤苦零丁的寡妇，活在这世界上真也不容易。厅长在路上折断了一个轮子，从上到下都溅满了泥污，总算艰难困苦的回了家。如果不算他在下巴上给自己的手杖撞出来的一块肿，那么，这些就是这没兴头，没结果的旅行的成绩。在自己的家的附近，他遇见了坐着马车，迎面而来的检事。检事好像很不高兴，垂着头。

“哪，您从梭巴开维支打听了些什么呀？”

检事低着头，回答道：“我一生中还没有吃过这样的亏……”

“这是怎的？”

“他踢了我一脚。”检事显着意气消沉的样子，说。

“怎么样呢？”

“他对我说，我是一个不中用的人，不配做我的职务；而且我还没有检举过自己的同僚。别的检事们每礼拜总写出检举文来，我可是每一件公事上写一个‘阅’字，自然是在我有报告同僚的义务的时候。——我也没有把一件事情故意压起来。”

检事全然挫折了。

“那么，关于乞乞科夫，他说了些什么呢？”厅长问。

“他说了些什么？他说我们都是老婆子，胡涂虫。”

厅长沉思起来了。但这时来了第三辆车：是副知事。

“我的先生们，我通知你们，大家应该小心了。人们说，我们这省里恐怕真的任命了一个总督。”

厅长和检事都张开了嘴巴，审判厅长还自己想：“我们办在那里的恶魔倒很感谢的羹汤，现在是快到自己来喝下去的时候了。如果他知道了这市里是多么乱七八糟！”

“打击上面又是打击！”完全失望的站在那里的检事，心里想。

“您可知道做总督的是谁，他是怎样的一个人，怎样的一种性格吗？”

“这可是什么也还没知道。”副知事说。

这瞬间来了邮政局长，坐着马车。

“我的先生们，新总督要到任了，我给你们贺喜。”

“我们已经知道，我们已经知道，不过还没有明白底细。”副知事说。

“那里，已经明白了的，那是谁。”邮政局长回答道。“阿特诺梭罗夫斯基·水门汀斯基公爵。”

“那么，人怎么谈论他呢？”

“他大概是一位很严厉的人物，”邮政局长说，“一位性格刚强的很是明亮的人。他先前是督办过什么一个公家的建筑委员会的，您懂了没有？有一回，出了一点小小的不规则。那么，您以为怎么样，可敬的先生，他把什么都捣烂了，他把大家都弄得粉碎了，弄得他们简直连什么也不剩，您瞧。”

“但在这市镇上，却用不着严厉的规则的。”

“哦，是啦，他是一位学问家，亲爱的先生！一位很博大的人物！”邮政局长接着说。“曾经有过一回什么……”

“然而我的先生们，”邮政局长道，“我们竟停了车子，在路上谈天。我们还不如走……”

这时候，绅士们才又清醒了过来。街道上却已经聚集了许多看客，张着嘴巴，在看这四位先生坐在自己的车子里，大家在谈话。马夫向马匹吆喝一声，于是四辆车子就接连着驶往审判厅长的家里去了。

“鬼竟也在不凑巧的时候把这乞乞科夫送到我们这里来！”厅长在前厅里脱着泥污一直溅到上面的皮外套，一面想。

“我头里是什么都胡里胡涂。”检事说着，也一样的脱了皮外套。

“对于这事情，我可不明白了。”副知事说，一面脱着他的皮外套。

邮政局长却什么话也不说，单是对于脱下他的外套来，觉得很满足。

大家走进屋子去，立刻就搬出一餐小酌来了。外省的衙门里，是决不能没有小酌的，如果两个省里的官员聚在一起，那么，小酌就自然会作为第三个，前来加入了联盟。

审判厅长走到桌子前，自己斟出一小杯苦味的艾酒，说道：“就是打死我，我也不知道这乞乞科夫是什么人。”

“我更有限。”检事说。“这样纠纷错杂的事件，是自从我任事以来，还没有出现过的。我实在再没有办这事情的胆量了。”

“然而！虽然如此，那人却有着怎么一种世界人物的洗练呵！”邮政局长说，一面先斟一杯淡黑色的蔗酒，再加上一两滴蔷薇色的去，使两样混合起来。“他一定到过巴黎。我极相信，他是一个外交官之流。”

这时候，那警察局长，那全市的无不知道而且大受爱戴的恩人，商人社会的神像，阔绰的早餐夜膳以及别的筵宴的魔术师和安排者，走进屋子里来了。

“我的先生们，”他叫了起来，“关于乞乞科夫，我一点也不能知道。他的纸片，我不能去翻检；他也总不离开他的屋子，好像生病似的。我也打听他的人，问了他的仆人彼得尔希加和马夫绥里方。第一个有点喝得烂醉，还好像什么时候都是这副模样。”说到这话，警察局长便走向小食桌，用三种蔗酒做起混合酒来。“彼得尔希加说，他的主人和各种人们往来，我看他举出来的，全是上等人，例如丕列克罗耶夫……他还说出一批地主来——都是六等官或者竟是五等官。绥里方讲，大家都把他看作一个能干的人，因为他办事实在又稳当，又出色。他曾在税关上办公，还进过一个公家的建筑委员会！是什么委员会呢，他可是说不清。他有三匹马：‘一匹还是三年前买来的，花马是用别一匹一样毛色的马换来的，第三匹也是买来的……’他说。他很切实的讲，乞乞科夫确是名叫保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，是六等官。”

“一个上等人，而且还是六等官，”检事想，“却决心来做这样的事情！诱拐知事的女儿，起了胡涂思想，要买死魂灵，还在深夜里，和睡着的地主老婆子去捣乱——这和骠骑兵官是相称的，和六等官可不相称！”

“如果他是六等官，他怎么会决计来做这样的犯罪的事情，假造钞票呢？”自己也是六等官，爱吹笛子的副知事想，他的精神，是倾向艺术远过于犯罪的。

“要说什么，说就是，我的先生们，不过我们应该给这事情有一个结束！要来的，来就是！您们想一想罢，如果总督一到任，鬼才知道我们会出什么事哩！”

“那么，您以为我们得怎么办呢？”

警察局长说道：“我想，我们先应该决计。”

“您说的是什么意思呢：这决计？”厅长问。

“我们应该逮捕他，当作一个犯了嫌疑的人。”

“是的，但怕不行罢？如果倒把我们当作犯了嫌疑的人，逮捕起来呢？”

“什……么？”

“哪，我想，他也许是派到这里来，有着秘密的全权的！死魂灵？哼！不但说他要买是一句假话，也是为了查明那个死人的假话，那报告上写了死得‘原因不明’的。”

这番话使大家都沉默了。检事尤其害怕。还有审判厅长，虽然是自己说出来的，却也在深思默想。两个人……

“那么，我的先生们，我们该怎么办呢？”那警察局长，即全市的恩人，商家的宝贝，说，一面灌下甜酒和苦酒的奇异混合酒去，还在嘴里塞了一点食物。

侍役搬进一瓶玛兑拉酒和几个杯子来。

“我真的不知道我们该怎么开手了！”厅长说。

“我的先生们，”邮政局长喝干一杯玛兑拉，吞下一片荷兰干酪，加奶油的一块鲟鱼之后，于是说道，“我是这样的意见，我们应该把这件事彻底的探索一下，我们应该把它彻底的研究一下，共同in-corpore(2)的商量一下，这就是说，我们总得大家聚集起来，像英国的议院那样，您懂了罢，来测量对象，明白透彻它一切细微曲折的详情，您懂了没有？”

“我们自然得在什么地方聚集一下的。”警察局长说。

“好的，我们来集会罢，”厅长说，“共向决定一下，这乞乞科夫是什么人。”

“好的，这才是聪明法子哩——我们应该决定一下，乞乞科夫是什么人。”

“我们要问问各人自己的意见，于是决定一下，乞乞科夫是什么人。”

一说这些话，大家就立刻觉到一种不再着急的心情，喝了一两杯香槟酒。人们走散了，满足得很，以为会议就会给他们分明切实的证据，乞乞科夫究竟是什么人。





四之A　戈贝金大尉的故事


（第一次的草稿）

“在一八一二年的出兵之后，贵重的先生，”邮政局长说，虽然并不是只有一个先生，房里在场的倒一共有六个，“在一八一二年的出兵之后，和别的伤兵一起，一个大尉，名叫戈贝金的，也送到卫戍病院里来了。这是在克拉斯努伊附近，或是在利俾瑟之战罢，那不关要紧，亲爱的先生，总之是他在战场上失去了一只臂膊和一条腿。您也知道，那时对于伤兵还没有什么设备，那废兵的年金——您也想得到——说起来，是一直到后来这才制定的。我们的戈贝金大尉一看，他应该做事，可是您很知道，他只有一条臂膊，就是那左边的一条。他就到他父亲的家里去，但那父亲给他的回答是：‘我也还不能养活你。’您想想就是！‘我自己就得十分辛苦，这才能够维持。’您瞧罢，贵重的先生，于是我的戈贝金决定，上彼得堡去，到该管机关那里，看他们可能给他一点小小的补助：他呢，说起来，是所谓牺牲了他的一生，而且流过血的……他坐着一辆货车或是公家的驿车，上首都去了，可敬的先生，他吃尽辛苦，这才到了彼得堡。您自己想想看：现在是这人，就是戈贝金大尉，在彼得堡，就是在所谓世上无双的地方了！他的周围一下子就光辉灿烂，所谓一片人生的广野，童话样的仙海拉宰台的一种，您听明白了没有？您自己想想就是，他面前忽然的躺着这么一条涅夫斯基大街，或者这么一条豌豆街，或者，妈的，这么一条列退那耶街，这里的空中耸着这么的一座塔，那里又挂着几道桥，您知道，一点架子和柱子也没有；一句话，真正的什米拉米斯，可敬的先生，实在的！他先在街上走了一转，为的是要租一间房子；然而对于他，什么都令人疑疑惑惑：所有这些窗幔，卷帘和所有鬼物事，您知道，就是地毯呀，真正波斯的，可敬的先生……一句话，是大家都在用脚踏着钱。人走过街上，鼻子远远的就觉得，千元钞票发着气味；您知道，我那戈贝金大尉的整个国立银行里，却只有五张蓝钞票，这就是一切，您懂了没有。于是他终于住在一个客店力伐耳市里，每天一卢布。您知道，午餐两样，一碟菜汤，加一片汤料肉。他看起来，他在这里是不能十分挥霍的。他就决定，明天到大臣那里去，可敬的先生。皇上那时候没有在首都，因为军队还没有从战地上回来，那是您自己也想得到的。于是他，有一天的早晨，起来的早一点，用左手理一理胡子，于是您瞧，他到理发店里去了，这是因为要显得新开张的意思，穿好他的制服，用木脚一拐一拐的走到大臣那里去。现在您自己想想就是，他先去问一个警察，那里是大臣的住宅。‘那边。’那人回答着，并且指示了邸宅区海岸边的一所房子，好一所精致的茅棚呀，我可以对您说！大玻璃窗，大镜子，大理石和到处的金属，您只要自己想想就是，可敬的先生！这样的门的把手，您知道，人得先跑到店里去买两戈贝克肥皂，于是，就这么说罢，来洗一两点钟手，这才敢于去捏它！一句话，什么都是紫檀和磁漆，要令人头昏眼花，可敬的先生！甬道上呢，您知道，站着一个门丁，真正的大元帅：这样的一副伯爵相，手里拿着刀，麻布领子，妈的！好像一匹养得很好的布尔狗。我的戈贝金总算拖着他的木脚走进前厅去，坐在一个角落里，只因为恐怕那臂膊在一个亚美利加或是印度上，在镀金的磁瓶上碰一下，您知道。您瞧，他自然应该等候许多工夫，因为他到这里的时候，那大臣说起来还刚刚起床，当差的正给他搬进什么一个银的盆子去，您很知道，是洗脸用的。我的戈贝金一直等了四个钟头之久，副官或是一个别的当值的官员总算出来了，说道：大臣就来。但在前厅里人们已经拥挤得好像盘子里的豆子一样，纯粹是四等官呀，大佐呀这些大官，有几处还有一个带肩绶的白胖大好佬，您知道，一句话，就是简直是所谓将校团。大臣到底也走进屋子里来了，可敬的先生！您自己想得到的：他先问这个，然后再问那个：您到这里贵干呀？那么，您呢？您有什么见教呢？临末也轮到了我的戈贝金，他鼓起全身的勇气，说道：‘如此如此，这般这般，我流了我的血，一条腿和一只臂膊失掉了，说起来，我已经不能做事，所以不揣冒昧，来求皇上的恩典的。’大臣看见这人装着义足，右边的袖子也空空的挂着。‘就是了，’他说，‘请您过几天再来听信罢。’哪，这么着，可敬的先生，过不了四五天，我的戈贝金就已经又在大臣那里出现了。大臣立刻认识了他，您知道。‘阿呀！’他说，‘可惜这回除了请您等到皇上回来之外，我不能给您别样的好消息。到那时候，对于伤兵和废兵总该会给些什么的，不过倘没有陛下的圣旨，说起来，我什么也不能替您设法。’于是他微微的一鞠躬，谒见就算完结了。您自己想得到的，当我的戈贝金从大臣那里出来的时候，真的没有了主意；说起来，他是没有得到许可，可也没有得到回绝。然而首都的生活，对于他自然一天一天的难起来，那是您很能明白的。于是他自己想：‘我要再去见一见大臣，对他说：请您随便帮一下，大人，我立刻要什么也没得吃了；如果您不帮助我，说起来，我就只好饿死了。’然而他到得大臣那里时，却道是：‘那不行，大臣今天不见客，您明天再来罢。’到第二天——一样的故事，那门丁连看也不大愿意看他了。我的戈贝金只还有一枚五十戈贝克的银元在衣袋里。先前呢，他还可以买一碟菜汤加上一片汤料肉，现在他却至多只能在那里买这么一点青鱼或者一点腌王瓜和几文钱的面包——一句话，这可怜的家伙可实在挨饿了，然而他却有狼一般的胃口。他常常走过什么一个饭店前面，现在您自己想想看：那厨子，是一个鬼家伙，一个外国人，您知道，总是只穿着很精致的荷兰小衫，站在他的灶跟前，在给你们豫备什么Finserb或是炸排骨加香菌，一句话，是很好的大菜，使我们的大尉馋的恨不得自己去吃一通。或者他走过米留丁的店门口：笑嘻嘻的迎着他的是一条熏鲑鱼，或者一篮子樱桃——每件五卢布，或者一大堆西瓜，简直是一辆公共汽车，您知道，都在窗子里，找寻着衣袋里有些多余的百来块钱的呆子，您想想罢，一句话，步步都是诱惑，真教人所谓嘴里流涎，然而对于他呢：请等到明天。现在请您设身处地的来想一想：一面呢，您瞧，熏鱼和西瓜，别一面呢，是这么的一种苦小菜：‘明天再来。’这可怜的家伙终于熬不下去了，决计无论如何再去谒见一下子。他站在甬道上等候着，看可还有一个什么请愿人出现；他终于也跟着一个将军，您知道，走进宅子去，用他的木脚拐进了前厅。大臣照平常的出来会客了：‘您有什么事呢？您有什么见教呢？’‘哦，’他一看见戈贝金，就叫起来，‘我可已经告诉过您了，您得等着，等到您的请求得到决定。’——‘我请求您，大人，我什么也没得吃了，说起来……’——‘那我有什么办法呢？我不能替您办，只好请您自己办，只好请您自己去想法。’——‘但是，大人，这是您可以自己所谓判断的，我没有了一只手和一条腿，怎能给自己想什么办法呢。’他还想添上去道：‘用鼻子是我可什么法子也没有，这至多只能擤一下鼻涕，然而就是这也还得买一块手巾。’但是那大臣，您瞧，亲爱的先生——也许是觉得戈贝金太麻烦了，或者他真的要办理国事——总之，那大臣是，您自己能明白的，非常生气了。‘您出去！’他大声说，‘像您似的人这里还多得很，您出去，静静的去等着，到轮到您了的时候！’——然而我的戈贝金却回答道——饥饿逼得他太利害了，您知道——‘随您的便，大人；在您给我相当的吩咐之前，我在这里是不动的。’这可是，亲爱的先生，您自己可以知道，那大臣简直气得要命。而且实实在在，像一个什么所谓戈贝金，敢对大臣来这么说，到现在为止，在世界史的记录上确也还不曾有过前例的。您自己可以知道，怎样的一位会恼怒的大臣，但说起来，这可是所谓国家的大员呀。‘您这不成体统的人！’他叫喊说。‘野战猎兵在那里？叫野战猎兵来，送他回家去罢！’然而那野战猎兵，您很知道，却已经站着，等在门外面了：这么一个高大的家伙，您知道。简直好像天造他来跑腿的一样。一句话，是一个很好的拔牙钳。于是我们这上帝的忠仆就被装在马车里，由野战猎兵带走了。‘唔，’戈贝金想，‘我至少也省了盘缠钱！这一点，我倒要谢谢大人老爷们的。’他这么的走着，可敬的先生，和那野战猎兵，当他这样的坐在野战猎兵的旁边的时候，说起来，他在所谓对自己说：‘好’，他说，‘大臣告诉我，我只好自己办，自己想法子！好，可以，’他说，‘我就来想法子罢！’他怎样的被送到他一定的地方，就是他到底弄到那里去了呢，什么也不知道。所以关于戈贝金大尉的消息，就沉在忘却的河流里面了，您知道，诗人之所谓莱多河。但这地方，您瞧，我的先生们，在这地方，可以说，却打着我们的奇闻的结子的。戈贝金究竟那里去了呢，谁也不知道；然而您自己想想罢，不到两个月，略山的林子里就现出一群强盗来，而这群强盗的头领，您瞧，却并非别的，正是戈贝金大尉。他招集了种种的逃兵，把他们组织了一个所谓强盗团。这时候是，您也明白，刚在战争之后，大家都还是过惯了没拘束的生活，您知道——那时性命差不多只值一文钱；自由，不羁，我对您说，大家什么都不放在眼里——总而言之，可敬的先生，他带领着一枝军队了。没有一个旅客能够平安的通过，不过说起来，却单是对于国帑。如果有人过路，只为了自己的事情——哪，他们就单是问：‘您去干什么的？’于是放他走。对国家的输送：粮秣呀，金钱呀的办法可是相反了——总之一句话，只要是带着所谓国家这一个名目的——那就对不起，那么，您自己就知道，他根本的抢着国帑的袋子。或者他一听到纳税的期限已在眼前了——他就马上到了这地方。他立刻叫了村长来，喊道：‘拿年贡和租税来。’哪，您可以自己想到的，乡下人一看：‘这么的一个跛脚鬼，他的衣领是红红的，还发着金光，像一匹菲涅克斯(3)的毛羽，妈的，要尝耳刮子味道的。’‘在这里，收去罢，老爷，但请您放我们平安。’他自然心里想：‘这该是那里的一个地方法官，或者也许是说起来，还要利害的脚色。’然而那钱呢，可敬的先生，那当然是他收去了，全像自己的一样，还给乡下人一个收条，使他们可以在主人面前脱掉干系，表明他们的确付过钱，完清了租税，征收的却是这个人，就是戈贝金大尉；哦，他竟还盖上一个自己的印章哩，一句话，可敬的先生，他就是这一种样子的抢劫。也派了许多回兵，要去捉拿他，可是我的戈贝金怕什么鸟。这些都是真正的亡命之徒。您知道，这些聚在这里的……但到他看见这已经不是玩笑，所谓弄坏了好菜的时候，到底也真的着了急；刻刻总在追捕，不过他自己却已经积起很大一批的钱的了，亲爱的先生，哪，于是他说起来，有一天就跑到外国去了，到外国，可敬的先生，您很知道，那就是到合众国。他从那边写了一封信给皇帝，您自己也想得到的罢，是一封措辞最精，文体极整的信，您几乎要出于意料之外的。所有古时候的柏拉图呀，迪穆司台纳斯呀——比起他来就简直是孱头或者奴仆：‘你不要相信罢，陛下呵，’他写着，‘以为我是这样那样的……’总而言之，他每段都用这话来开头——真出色！‘只有必要是我的举动的原因，’他说，‘我说起来，是流了我的血，而且所谓不惜生命的，而现在呢，您只要想想就是，再也没法生活了。’‘我请求你，释放我的伙伴，不加责罚，’他说，‘他们无罪，因为是我把他们所谓加以诱引的，请垂仁慈，并且降旨，倘将来有战事上的伤兵回来，’您自己想想就是，‘所谓给他们设法……’一句话，这封信是极其精练整齐的，哪，您自己想想就是，皇上自然是被感动了。他的龙心起了怜悯，虽然他是罪人，而且说起来是所谓要处死刑的，哪，而且他看起来，一个好人也会成为罪犯，这是应该算作不得已的犯罪，给以宽恕的——况且在不太平的时候，也不能什么全都顾虑到——只有上帝，人可以说，完全没有缺点——一句话，亲爱的先生，这一回是皇上开了所谓仁厚的圣意的前古未闻的例子了：他下谕旨，不再追捕犯人，接着又下严紧的谕旨，设起委员会来，专办保护伤兵的事务，说起来，这就是……可敬的先生——就是废兵年金的基础的一个动机，由此成了现在的所谓伤兵善后，相像的设施，实在是连英国和此外一切的文明国度里都没有的，您自己想想就是。这样的是戈贝金大尉，可敬的先生。但现在我相信这样的事：他一定是在合众国把所有的钱都化光了，就回到我们这里来，要再试一回所谓新计画，虽然说起来，他也许做不到。”





四之B　戈贝金大尉的故事


（被审查官所抹掉的原稿）

“在一八一二年的出兵之后，可敬的先生，”邮政局长说，虽然并不是只有一个先生，坐在房里的倒一共有六个，“在一八一二年的出兵之后，和别的伤兵一起，有一个大尉名叫戈贝金的，也送到卫戍病院里来了。这是在克拉斯努伊附近，或是在利俾瑟之战罢，那不关紧要，总之是他在战场上失去了一只臂膊和一条腿。您也知道，那时对于伤兵还没有什么设备：那废兵的年金，您也想得到，说起来，是一直到后来这才制定的。戈贝金大尉一看，他应该做事，可是您瞧，他只有一条臂膊，就是左边的那一条。他就到他父亲的家里去，但那父亲给他的回答是：‘我也还是不能养活你；我，’您想想就是，‘我自己就得十分辛苦，这才能够维持。’于是我的戈贝金大尉决定，您明白，可敬的先生，上彼得堡去，到该管机关那里，看他们可能给他一点小小的补助。如此如此，他呢，说起来，是所谓牺牲了他的一生，而且流过血的……他坐着一辆货车或是公家的驿车，上首都去了，您瞧，可敬的先生，不消说，他吃尽辛苦，这才到了彼得堡。您自己想想看：现在是这人，就是戈贝金大尉，在彼得堡，就是在所谓世上无双的地方了！他的周围忽然光辉灿烂，所谓一片人生的广野，童话样的仙海拉宰台的一种，您明白了罢。您自己想想就是，他面前忽然躺着这么一条涅夫斯基大街，或者这么一条豌豆街，或者，妈的，这么一条列退那耶街，这里的空中耸着这么的一座塔，那里又挂着几道桥，您知道，一点架子和柱子也没有，一句话，真正的什米拉米斯。实在的，可敬的先生！他先在街上走了一转，为的是要租一间房子；然而对于他，什么都令人疑疑惑惑：所有这些窗幔，卷帘和所有鬼物事，您知道，就是地毯呀，真正波斯的，可敬的先生……一句话，是大家都在用脚踏着钱。人走过街上，鼻子远远的就觉得，千元钞票发着气味；您知道，我那戈贝金大尉的整个国立银行里，却只有十张蓝钞票……够了，他终于住在一个客店力伐耳市里，每天一卢布。您知道，午餐两样，一碟菜汤，加一片汤料肉……他看起来，他的钱是用不多久的。他就打听，他应该往那里去。人们对他说，有这样的一个最高机关，说起来，是这样的一个所谓委员会，上头这样这样的en chef(4)的是将军。皇上呢，您总该知道，那时候还没有在首都，还有军队，您自己可以明白的，也还没有从巴黎回来，一切都还在外国。于是我的戈贝金有一天的早晨起来的早一点，用左手理一理胡子，于是你瞧，他到理发店里去了，这是因为要显得新开张的意思，穿好他的制服，用木脚一拐一拐的走到委员会的上司那里去。您只要自己想想就是！他问，上司住在那里呢。‘那边。’人回答着，并且指示了邸宅区海岸边的一所房子。好一所精致的茅棚呀，您明白的。窗上是几尺长的玻璃，我可以告诉您，瓶子和别的一切东西，凡是在屋子里面的，全显在外面的人的眼前，令人觉得这些好东西仿佛都摸得到：墙壁是贵重的大理石，您知道，什么都是金属做的，这样的一个门上的把手，您自己想想罢，人得先跑到店里去买两戈贝克肥皂，于是就这么说罢，来洗一两点钟手，这才敢于去捏它。而且什么都用磁漆来漆过的，一句话，令人头昏眼花。门丁恰如大元帅：这样的一副伯爵相，手拿一把金色的刀，麻布领子，妈的，好像一匹养得很好的布尔狗。我的戈贝金总算拖着他的木脚走进前厅去，坐在一个角落里，只因为恐怕那臂膊在亚美利加或是印度上，在镀金的磁瓶上，您很知道的，碰一下。您瞧，他自然应该等候许多工夫，因为他到这里的时候，那将军呢，说起来，还刚刚起床，当差的正给他搬进什么一个银的盆子去，您很知道，是洗脸用的。我的戈贝金一直等了四个钟头之久；副官或是什么当值的官员总算出来了，说道：‘将军就来！’但在客厅里人们已经拥挤得好像盘子里的豆子一样。都是四等呀五等的高等官，并不是我们这样的可怜的奴隶，倒统统是大员，有几处还有一个带肩绶的白胖大好佬，一句话，简直是所谓将校团。屋子里忽然起了一种不大能辨的动摇，仿佛是微妙的以太，您知道。处处听得有人叫着嘘……嘘……于是来了一种可怕的寂静，国务大员走进屋子里来了。哪，您自己想得到的，一位国务员，说起来，自然，他的相貌就正和他的品级和官位相称，这样的一副样子，您懂了罢。所有人们，凡是在客厅里的，当然立刻肃然的站了起来，战战兢兢的等候着他的运命的决定，说起来，大臣或者国务员就先问这个，然后再问那个。‘您到这里贵干呀？那么，您呢？您有什么见教呢？您光降是为了什么事情呢？’临末也轮到了我的戈贝金，他鼓起全身的勇气，说道：‘如此如此，这般这般，大人，我流了我的血，所谓一只臂膊和一条腿失掉了。我已经不能做事，所以不揣冒昧，来求皇帝的恩典的。’大臣看见这人装着义足，右边的袖子也空空的挂着，您知道。‘就是了，’他说，‘请您过几天再来听信罢！’我的戈贝金真是高兴非凡：他已经做到了谒见，和国家的第一流勋贵谈过天，您自己想想就是，还有那希望，就是他的运命，即所谓关于恩饷的问题到底也要解决了！他非常之得意，我可以对您说。他简直在铺道上直跳。于是他到巴勒庚酒店去，喝烧酒；在伦敦吃中饭，叫了一碟炸排骨加胡椒花苞，再是一碟嫩鸡带各样的作料，还有一瓶葡萄酒，夜里上戏院——一句话，这是一场阔绰的筵宴，说起来。他在铺道上忽然看见来了一个英国女人，您知道，长长的，像天鹅一样。我的戈贝金，狂喜到血都发沸了，就下死劲的要用他的木脚跟着她跑，下死劲，下死劲，下死劲，‘唔，不行！’他想，‘且莫忙妈的什么娘儿们；慢慢的来，等我有了恩饷。我实在太荒唐了。’三四天之后，我的戈贝金又在大臣那里出现了。大臣走了进来。‘如此如此，’戈贝金说，‘我来了，为的是问问您大人对于生病和负伤的运命，要怎样的办理……还有这一些，您自己想得到的，自然是公家的实信！’那国务大员，您想象一下罢，立刻认识他了。‘哦，好的，’他说，‘可惜这回除了请您等到皇上回来之外，我不能给您别样的好消息；到那时候，对于伤兵和废兵总该会给些什么的，不过倘没有陛下的圣旨，说起来，我什么也不能替您设法。’于是他微微的一鞠躬，谒见就算完结了，您懂了罢。您自己想得到的，我的戈贝金可真的没有了主意。他已经打算过，以为明天就会付给他钱的。‘这是你的，我的亲爱的，喝一下高兴高兴罢！’他现在却只好等候，而且等到不知什么时候为止了，于是他就像一匹猫头鹰或者一只茸毛狗，给厨子泼了一身水，从长官那里跑出来——夹着尾巴，挂下了耳朵。‘不成，’他想，‘我还要去一回，对大臣说，我立刻要什么也没得吃了，如果您不帮助我，说起来，我就只好饿死了。’总而言之，亲爱的先生，他就再到邸宅区海岸边去问大臣。‘那不行，’就是，‘大臣今天不见客，您明天再来罢。’到第二天——一样的故事，那门丁连看也不大愿意看他了。我的戈贝金只还有一张蓝钞票在衣袋里，您知道。先前呢，他还可以买一碟菜汤加上一片汤料肉，现在他却至多只能在那里买这么一点青鱼或者一点腌王瓜和几文钱的面包——一句话，这可怜的家伙可实在挨饿了，然而他却有狼一般的胃口。他常常走过什么一个饭店前面，现在您自己想想看，那厨子——是这么的一个外国人，一个法兰西人，您知道，那么一副坦白的脸，总是只穿着很精致的荷兰小衫，还有一块围身，说起来，雪似的白，这家伙现在站在他的灶跟前，在给你们做什么Finserb或是炸排骨加香菌，一句话，是很好的大菜，使我们的大尉馋的恨不得自己去吃一通。或者他走过米留丁的店门口：笑嘻嘻的迎着他的是一条熏鲑鱼，或者一篮子樱桃——每件五卢布，或者一大堆西瓜，简直是一辆公共汽车，您知道，都在窗子里，向外面找寻着衣袋里有些多余的百来块钱的呆子；您想想罢，一句话，步步是诱惑，真教人所谓嘴里流涎，然而对于他呢：请等到明天。现在请您设身处地的来想一想：一面呢，您瞧，熏鱼和西瓜，别一面呢，是这么的一种苦小菜，那名目就叫作‘明天再来。’这可怜的家伙终于熬不下去了，决计去所谓突击一回堡垒，您懂得罢。他站在甬道上等候着，看可还有一个什么请愿人出现；不错，他等到了，跟着一个将军，用他的木脚拐进了前厅。国务大员照平常的出来会客了：‘您有什么见教呢？那么，您呢？’‘哦！’他一看见戈贝金，就叫起来，‘我可已经告诉过您了，您得等着，等到您的请求得到决定。’——‘我请求您，大人，我什么也没得吃了，说起来……’‘那我有什么办法呢？我不能替您办，只好请您自己办，只好请您自己去想法。’——‘但是，大人，这是您可以自己所谓判断的，我没有了一只手和一条腿，怎能给自己想什么办法呢？’——‘但您得明白，’大臣说，‘我可不能拿我的东西来养您呀，我们还有许多伤兵，都可以有这一种要求的。您用忍耐武装起来罢。我给您一个我的誓言：如果皇上回来，他就有恩典，不会把您置之不理的。’——‘但是我等不下去了，大人。’戈贝金说，并且他实在已经所谓莽撞起来了。可是国务大员有些发了恼，您知道，而且在实际上：周围都站着将军们，在等候一句回答或者一个命令；这里是在处理所谓国家大事，办事要神速的——空费一点时光就有影响——可是来了这么一个会纠缠的恶魔，拉住人不放，您想想就是——‘对不起，我没有工夫——我还有别的事情要做，比和您说话更其要紧的。’他说得很所谓体面，是正到了他该跑掉的时候了，您懂得的罢。然而我的戈贝金回答道——饥饿逼得他太利害了，您应该知道。‘随您的便，大人，在您给我相当的吩咐之前，我在这里是不动的。’哪，您自己想想看，对一位国务大员，只要用一句话，就会把人抛向空中，连魔鬼也无从找着的人，竟这样的答话……如果有一个官，比我们不过小一级，要是对我们这么说话，就已经算是无礼了。然而现在您自己想想罢——这距离，这非常的距离！一个将军en chef和什么一个戈贝金！九十卢布和一个零。那将军，您懂么，只向他瞪了一眼——所谓简直是炮击：没有一个会不手足无措，魂飞魄散的。然而我的戈贝金，您自己想想就是，却在那地方一动也不动，站着好像生了根。‘唔？您在等什么？’将军说着，用两只手搭在他的肩膀上。但是，老实说，他对他是还算有些仁厚的，要是别人，会喷骂得他三天之后，所有的街道还是翻了面，而且带着他打旋子，说起来，然而他不过说：‘好罢，如果您觉得这里的生活太贵，又不能在京里静候您的运命的决定，那我用官费送您回家去就是了。叫野战猎兵来，递解他回家去罢！’然而那野战猎兵，您很知道，却已经站着，等在门外面了：这么一个高大的家伙，您知道，简直好像天造他来跑腿的一样。一句话，是一个很好的拔牙钳。于是我们这上帝的忠仆就被装在马车里，由野战猎兵带走了。‘唔，’戈贝金想，‘我至少也省了盘缠钱。这一点，我倒要谢谢大人老爷们的。’他这么的走着，可敬的先生，和那野战猎兵，当他这样的坐在野战猎兵的旁边的时候，说起来，他在所谓对自己说：‘好，’他说，‘你告诉我，我只好自己办，自己想法子，好，可以，’他说，‘我就来想法子罢！’他怎样的被送到他一定的地方，就是他到底弄到那里去了呢，什么也不知道。所以关于戈贝金大尉的消息，就沉在忘却的河流里面了，您知道，诗人之所谓莱多河。但这地方，您瞧，我的先生们，在这地方，可以说，却打着我们的奇闻的结子的。戈贝金究竟那里去了呢，谁也不知道；然而您自己想想罢。不到两个月，略山的林子里就现出一群强盗来，而这群强盗的头领，您瞧，却并非别的……”

第二部（残稿）





第一章


为什么我们要从我们的祖国的荒僻和边鄙之处，把人们掘了出来，拉了出来，单将我们的生活的空虚，而且专是空虚和可怜的缺点，来公然展览的？——但如果这是作者的特性，如果他有一种特别的脾气，就只会这一件事：从我们的祖国的荒僻和边鄙之处，把人们掘了出来，来描写我们的生活的空虚，而且专是空虚和可怜的缺点，那又有什么法子呢？于是我们又跑到荒僻之处的中心，又闯进一个寂寥的，凄凉的窠里来了。而且还是怎样的一个窠，怎样的一个荒僻之处呵！

恰如带着炮塔和角堡的无际的城墙一样，一座不断的连山，联绵曲折着有一千维尔斯他之远。它倨傲的，尊严的耸在无边的平野里，忽而是精光的粘土和白垩的断崖，忽而是到处开裂的崩坠的绝壁，忽而又是碧绿的山顶模样，被着从枯株上发出的新丛，远望就像柔软的羊皮一样，忽而终于是茂密的，幽暗的森林了，奇怪得很，还没有遭过斤斧。那溪流呢，到处在高岸间潺湲，跟着山蜿蜒曲折，只有几处离开了它，飞到平野和牧场那里去，流作闪闪的弯曲，突然不见了，还在白桦，白杨，或者赤杨的林中，映着辉煌的阳光，灿然一闪，但到底又胜利的从昏暗中出现，受着每一曲折之处的小桥，水磨和堤防的相送，奔波而去了。

有一处地方，是险峻的山地，特别满饰着新的绿树的螺发，仗着山地的不一律，由人力的树艺，南北的植物都聚起来了。槲树，枫树，梨树和柳丛，蒌蒿和白桦，还有绕着蛇麻的山薇，这边协力着，彼此互助着滋生，那边妨碍着，挤得紧紧的，都满生在险峻的山上。山顶上面，在碧绿的枝梢间，夹杂着地主老爷的红屋顶，藏在背后的农家的屋角和屋梁，主邸的高楼和它那雕花的露台和半圆的窗户——再在这挨挤的房屋和树木的一团之上，是一所旧式的教堂，将它那五个贴金的光辉灿烂的阁顶耸在天空中。这阁顶上装饰着金的雕镂的十字架，是用同一质料的也施雕镂的锁索，系在圆顶格上的，远远一望，令人觉得好像空气被毫无支架，浮在蔚蓝的天宇中的发光的铸了钱的黄金，烧得红光闪闪。而这树木，屋顶和十字架的一团，又出色的倒映在溪水里，这里有高大的不等样的杨柳，一部份剩在岸上，一部份站在水中，把它那纠缠着碧绿的，粘腻的水草和茂盛的睡莲的枝叶浸入溪流，仿佛在凝眺这辉煌的景象。

这风景实在很出色，然而从高处向着山谷，从府邸的高楼向着远方的眺望，却还要美丽得多。没有一个宾客，没有一个访问者能够淡然的在露台上久立，他总是惊异得喘不出气来，只好大声呼喊道：“天哪，这里是多么旷远和开展呵！”一片无边无际的空阔，在眼前展开：点缀着小树林和水磨的牧场后面，耸立着郁苍的森林，像一条微微发光的丝带；森林之后是在渐远渐昏的空际，隐现着闪闪的黄色的沙丘；接着这就又是森林，青苍隐约，恰如辽阔的大海或者平远的烟霭；后面又是沙丘，已经没有前一道的清楚了，然而还是很分明的在黄苍苍的空气中发闪。在远远的地平线上，看见山脊的轮廓：这是白垩岩，虽在极坏的天候，也自灿然发白，似乎为永久的太阳所照射。在这一部份是石膏岩的山脚下，由雪白的质地衬托出几个烟雾似的依稀的斑点来：这是远处的乡村，却已不是人的目力所能辨别——但见一个教堂的金色的尖顶，炎炎的火花似的忽明忽灭，令人觉得这该是住着许多人们的较大的村庄。但全体却沉浸于深的寂静中，绝不被在澄净的大气里飘扬，忽又在遥远的寥廓里消失的隐约可闻的空际歌人的歌词所妨碍。总而言之，是没有一个宾客和访问者能在露台上静下来的；如果站着凝眺了一两点钟，他就总是反复着这句话：“天哪，这里是多么旷远和开展呵！”

然而这宛然是不可攻取的城寨，从这方面并无道路可通的田庄的居人和地主，是什么人呢？人应该从别一方面去——那地方有许多散种的槲树，在欣欣然迎接渐渐临近的行人，远伸着宽阔的枝条，像一个朋友的臂膊，把人一直引到邸宅那里去，那屋顶，是我们已经从后面看见过了的，现在却完全显现了，在一大排农人小屋，带着雕刻的屋栋和屋角，以及它那十字架和雕镂的悬空的锁索，都在发着金光的教堂的中间。

这是忒莱玛拉罕斯克省的地主安特来·伊凡诺维支·田退德尼科夫的地方。这福人是一个三十三岁的年青的汉子，而且还没有结过婚。

这地主安特来·伊凡诺维支·田退德尼科夫又是何等样人呢？是什么人物？特质怎样，性格如何？——那我们可当然应该去打听亲爱的邻人了，好心的读者女士们。邻人们中的一个，是退伍佐官和快乐主义者一流，现在是已经死掉了，往往用这样的话来说明他道：“一匹极平常的猪狗！”一位将军，住在相距大约十维尔斯他的地方，时常说：“这小伙子并不蠢，但是他脑袋里装得太多了。我能够帮助他，因为我在彼得堡有着一点连络，而且在……”将军从来没有说完他的话。地方审判厅长的回答却用了这样的形式：“明天我要向他收取还没完清的税款去了！”一个农夫，对于他的主人是何等样人的问题，简直什么回答也没有。总而言之，邻人们对他所抱的意见，是很不高妙的。但去掉成见的来说，安特来·伊凡诺维支却实在并不是坏人，倒仅仅是无所为的活在世上的一个。就是没有他，无所为的活在世上的家伙也多得很，为什么田退德尼科夫就不该这么着呢？至于其余，我们只将他每天相同的一天的生活，给一个简短的摘要，他是怎样的性格，他的生活，和围绕着他的天然之美相关到怎样，请读者由此自去判断就是了。

每天早上，他照例醒得很晚，于是坐在床上，很久很久的擦眼睛。晦气的是他的眼睛小得很，所以这工作就需要很多的时光。在这施行期间，有一个汉子，名叫米哈罗，拿着一个面盆和一条手巾，站在房门口。这可怜的米哈罗在这里总得站个点把钟；后来走到厨房里去了，于是仍复回转来；但他的主人却还是坐在床上，尽在擦他的眼睛。然而他终于跳起来了，洗过手脸，穿好睡衣，走进客厅里去喝一杯茶，咖啡，可可，或者还有鲜牛奶。他总是慢吞吞的喝，一面胡乱的撒散着面包屑，漠不关心的到处落着烟卷灰。单是吃早餐，他就要坐到两点钟，但是这还不够。他又取一杯凉茶，慢慢的走到对着庭园的窗口去，在这里，是每天演着这样的一出的。

首先，是侍者性质的家丁格力戈黎，和管家女贝菲利耶夫娜吵架，这是他照例用了这样的话来道白的：“哼，你这贱货，你这不中用的雌儿的你！你还是闭了嘴的好，你这野种！”

“你要这样吗？”这雌儿或是贝菲利耶夫娜给他看一看捏紧的拳头，怒吼着，这位雌儿，虽然极喜欢锁在自己箱子里的葡萄干，果子酱和别的甜东西，但是并非没有危险，态度也实在很粗野，勇壮的。

“你还和当差的打过架哩，你这沙泥，轻贱的。”格力戈黎叫喊道。

“那当差的可也正像你一样，是一个贼骨头呀，你想是老爷不知道你吗？他可是在那里，什么都听见。”

“老爷在那里呀？”

“他坐在窗口，什么都看见。”

一点不错，老爷坐在窗口，什么都看见。

还有来添凑这所多玛和哥摩剌(1)的，是一个孩子在院子里放声大叫，因为母亲给了他一个耳光，还有一匹猎狗也一下子坐倒，狂吠起来了；厨子从窗口倒出沸水来，把它烫坏；总而言之，是一切都咆哮，喧嚷得令人受不住。那主人却看着一切，听着一切，待到这吵闹非常激烈，快要妨碍他田退德尼科夫的无所为了，他这才派人到院子里来，说道，但愿下面闹得轻一点。

午餐之前的两点钟，安特来·伊凡诺维支是坐在书房里，做着一部伟大的著作，要从所有一切的立场，社会的，政治的，哲学的和宗教的，来把捉和照见全体俄罗斯；并且解决时代所给与的困难的悬案和问题，分明的决定俄国的伟大的将来，是在那一条道路上；总而言之，这是一部现代人才能够计画出来的著作。但首先是关于他那主意的杰构的布置：咬着笔干，在纸上画一点花儿，于是又把一切都推在一边；另外拿起一本书，一直到午餐时候不放下。一面喝羹汤，添酱油，吃烧肉以及甜点心，一面慢慢的看着这本书，弄得别的肴馔完全冰冷了，有些还简直没有动。于是又喝下一杯咖啡去，吸起烟斗儿，独自玩一局象棋做消遣。到晚餐时候为止，此外还做些什么呢——可实在很难说。我想，大概是什么也不做了。

这三十三岁的年青人，就总是穿着睡衣，不系领带，完全孤独而且离开了世界，消遣着他的时光。散步和奔波，他不喜欢，他从来不高兴到外面去走走，或者开一扇窗户，把新鲜空气放进房里来。乡村的美丽的风景，宾客和访问者是不胜其叹赏的，但对于主人自己，却仿佛一无所有，读者由此可以知道，这安特来·伊凡诺维支·田退德尼科夫，是属于在俄国已经绝迹，先前是叫作睡帽，废料，熊皮等等的一大群里面的，现在我可实在找不出名目。这样的性质，是生成的，还是置身严厉的环境里，作为一个悲凉的生活关系的出产，造了出来的，是一个问题。要来解答，也许还是讲一讲安特来·伊凡诺维支的童年和学龄的故事，较为合适罢。

开初，是大家都说他会很有些聪明的。到十二岁，有一点病态和幻想了，但以神经锐敏的儿童，进了一个学校，那校长，是一位当时实在很不平常的人：是少年们的偶像，所有教师们的惊奇的模范，亚历山大·保甫洛维支有一种非常微妙的感觉。他多么熟悉俄国人的性质呵！他多么知道孩子的心情呵！他多么懂得引导和操纵儿童呵！刁滑的和捣乱的如果闹出事情来，没有一个不自己去找校长招认他的胡行和坏事的。然而这还不是全部：他受了严重的责罚，但小滑头却并不因此垂头丧气，反比先前更加昂然的走出屋子来。他的脸上有着新鲜的勇气模样的东西，一种心里的声音在告诉他道：“前去！快点站起，再静静的立定罢。虽然你跌倒了。”校长对于他的少年们从不多讲好规矩。他单是常常说：“我只希望我的学生一件事：就是他们伶俐和懂事，此外什么也没有！谁有想要聪明的雄心，他就没有工夫胡闹；那胡闹也就自然消灭了。”而且也真是这样子，胡闹完全消灭了，一个不肯用功的学生，只好受他的同窗的轻蔑。年纪大的蠢才和傻子，就得甘受最年幼者给他起的极坏的绰号，不能动一动他们的毫毛。“这太过了！”许多人说。“孩子太伶俐，就会骄傲的。”——“不，毫没有太过，”他回答道，“资质低的学生，我是不久留在校里的，只要他修完了课程，就足够了；但给资质好的，我却还有别样的科目。”而且实在，资质好的可真得修完一种别样的课程。他许可看许多捣乱和胡闹，毫不想去禁止它；在孩子的这轻举妄动里，他看见他们的精神活动的滋长的开端，他还声明说，在他，这是少不得的，倒非常必要，恰如一个医生的看疹子——为了精密的调查人的内部，究竟在怎样的发展着起来。

然而孩子们也多么爱他呵！孩子对他的父母，也没有这样的依恋和亲爱，在不顾前后的年纪，投入怀抱的奔放的情热，也不及对于他的爱的强烈和坚牢。他的感恩的门徒们，一直到入墓，一直到临终，都在他久经死去的先生的生辰，举起酒杯，来作纪念，闭了眼睛，为他下感伤之泪。从他嘴里得一句小小的夸奖，学生们就高兴得发抖，萌生努力的志愿，要胜过所有的同窗。没有资质的人，他是不给久留在校里的；他们只须修完一种短短的课程；但有资质的，就得做加倍的学业，而全由特选生组成的最高年级，则和别的学校完全不相同。到这一级，这才把别的胡涂虫所施教于孩子的东西，来向学生们施教——就是发达的理性，不自戏弄，然而了然，安受讥笑，宽恕昏愚，力戒轻率，不失坚忍，决不报怨，长保俨然的宁静和坚定的自持；只要遇到可以把人炼成一个强毅的人的一切，就来实行，他自己也和学生们在不断的尝试和实验。唉唉，他是多么深通人生的科学呵！

他的教师的数目不很多，大部份的学科都由他自己教。他知道不玩学者的排场，不用难懂的术语，不说高远的学说和胖大的空谈，而讲述学问的精神，就是还未成年的人，也立刻懂得，他将这智识有什么用。从一切学问里，他只选取教人成为祖国的一个公民的东西。他的讲义，大半是关于青年的将来的，且又善于将他们的人生轨道的全局，在学生面前展开，使青年们在学校的桌子上，那精神的一切思维和梦想，却已在将来的职务：为国家出力。他对他们毫不遮瞒：无论是起于人生前路的绝望和艰难，无论是算着他们的试炼和诱惑，都以绝无粉饰的裸露，陈在他们的眼前，什么隐讳也没有。他又熟悉一切官职和职务，好像亲身经历过似的。奇怪得很，也许是他们起了非常强烈的雄心，也许是在这非凡的教育家的眼里，含着叱咤青年“前去”的东西罢——这句话，是俄国人非常耳熟，也在他们的敏感的天性上，有伟大的神奇作用的——总而言之，青年们就立刻去找寻艰苦，渴望着克服一种困难或者一个障碍，以及显出英毅和神勇的地方。修完了这课程的，固然非常之少，然而也都是坚强的好汉，所谓站在硝烟里面的。出去办公，他们也只得到不安稳的地位，比他们聪明的许多人，已经耐不下去，为了小小的个人的不舒服，就放弃一切，或者行乐，偷懒，落在骗子和强盗的手里了。他们却站得极稳，毫不动摇的在自己的哨位上，还由认识人物和性灵，而更加老练，也将一种强有力的道德的影响，给与了不良和不正的人们。

孩子的热烈的雄心，是只为着到底能够编进这学级里去的思想，鼓动了很久的。给我们的田退德尼科夫，人总以为再没有比这样的教育家更好的了。但不幸的是刚在允许他编入级里的时候——这是他非常想望的——这位非凡的教师竟突然死掉了。对于少年人，这真是一个大打击，一个吓人的，无可补救的损失。现在是学校立刻两样了。亚历山大·彼得洛维支的位置上，来了一个叫作菲陀尔·伊凡诺维支的人。他首先是定出单管表面的章程和严厉的规则，并且向孩子们督促着只有成年人才能做到的东西。他把自由的解放，看作粗蛮和放纵。恰如反对着他的前任校长似的，在第一天，他就声明在学问上的理解和进步，毫无价值，最要紧的是好品行。然而怪哉！菲陀尔·伊凡诺维支在这么竭力经营的好品行，从他的学生那里却是得不到。他们玩着一切坏道儿，不过很秘密。白天是好像有点秩序的，但到夜里，可就闹起粗野的不拘礼节的筵宴和小吃来了。

在学问上也弄得很奇怪，菲陀尔·伊凡诺维支请了有着新的见解和主意的新教师。他们向学生们落下新的言语和术语的很急的雹子来；他们的开讲，并不怠慢逻辑的联系，也注意于科学的新进步，又不缺少热烈和精诚——然而，唉唉，他们的学问上，却欠缺真实的生活！死知识讲出来有些硬，而且死气沉沉的。一句话，就是什么都颠倒了。对于学校当局和师长的尊敬，完全失坠，大家嘲笑着教师，连校长也叫作菲地加(2)，起了“打鼓手”以及别样出色的绰号了。暗暗的起了坏风气，简直毫不再有烂漫的天真，那些学生们就闹着很狡猾的乱子，令人只好从中开除了许多。两年之间，这学校就几乎面目全非了。

安特来·伊凡诺维支的性质是安静，温和的。他反对同学们在校长住宅的窗前，毫无规矩的留住了一个小妇人，来开不讲礼节的夜宴，也不赞成他们的对于宗教的攻击和坏话，只因为偶然有一个真很愚蠢的教士来做教师，他们闹得过火了。不但如此，他是梦想着自己的魂灵，发源于天国的。这还不至于迷惑他，然而他立刻因此很懊丧。他的雄心已经觉醒了，可惜的是并无用武之地。这雄心，也许还是没有起来的好罢。安特来·伊凡诺维支听着教授们在讲台上大发气焰，一面就记起了并不这么起劲，却也总是说得很明白，很易解的先前的先生。他有什么对象和学课没有听呢！哲学，医学，还有法学，世界通史，详细到整整三年间，教授总算讲完了序论和关于所谓德意志联邦的成立——天知道他什么还没有听了，然而这些都塞在他脑子里，像一堆歪七竖八的零碎——亏得他天质好，觉到了这并不是正当的教育法，但要怎样才算是正当的呢——他却自己也不明白。他于是时常记起亚历山大·彼得洛维支来，心里沉钿钿的，悲伤到不知道要怎么样才好。

然而青春还有着将来，这正是它的幸福。到得快要毕业的时候，他的心在胸膛里跳得很活泼了。他对自己说：“这一切可还不是人生，真的人生是要到为国效力这才开始的，那可进了大有作为的时期了。”于是他毫不顾及使所有宾客耸然惊叹的美丽的乡村，也不去拜扫他父母的坟墓，恰如一切雄才大志的人们一样，照着一切青年所抱的热烈的目的，赶忙跑上彼得堡去了，那些青年们，就是都为了给国家去服务，为了赚堂皇的履历，或者也不过为了想添一点我们那冰冷的，没有颜色的，昏昏沉沉的社会的情态，从俄国的各地，聚到这里来的。然而安特来·伊凡诺维支的雄心大志，立刻被他的叔父，现任四等官阿奴弗黎·伊凡诺维支挫折了，他直捷的说，第一要紧的是写得一笔好字！除此之外，什么都不相干；要不然，他就没法做到大官或者得着高级的地位。仗了他叔父的非常的尽力和庇护，总算给他在属下的衙门里找到了一个小位置。当他跨进那发光的地板，亮漆的桌子的辉煌华丽的大厅，仿佛国家的最高的勋臣，就坐在这里决定全国的运命的时候，当他看见了漂亮的绅士一大堆，坐着歪了头，笔尖写得飕飕的发响，招呼他坐在一顶桌子前，去抄一件公事的时候（好像是故意给他毫无意思的东西的，只为着三个卢布的诉讼，这么那么的已经抄写了半个年头了），一种非常奇怪的感情，就来侵袭这未经世故的青年了。环坐在他周围的绅士们，使他明明白白的记起学校的生徒来。他们中的有几个，在听讲义时一心一意的只看翻译出来的无聊的小说，就使情形更加神似；他们把小说夹在公文的页子里，装作好像在检查案卷模样，长官在门口一出现，他也就吃一惊。这一切都使他很诧异，而且总觉得他先前的工作，到底更其有意义，而办公的豫备，也远胜于实在的办公。他并神往于自己的学校时代了。亚历山大·彼得洛维支就忽然像活着似的站在他的眼前——他好容易这才熬住了眼泪。

全部的屋子都旋转起来。桌子和官员，转得混成一团。他眼前骤然一黑，几乎倒在地上了。“不能，”他一定神，就对自己说，“纵使事务见得这么琐屑，我可也要办的。”他鼓起勇气之后，就决心像别人一样，把自己的事务安心办下去。

世界那里会毫无快乐？就是彼得堡，表面上虽然见得粗糙和阴郁，却也给人许多乐趣的。外面君临着三十三度的怕人的严寒；风卷雪的巫女，是朔方的孩儿，恰如脱了束缚的恶魔似的，咆哮着在空中奔腾，愤愤的把雪片打着街道，粘住人们的眼睛，还用白粉洒在人的皮袍和外套的领子上，动物的嘴脸上；但在盘旋交错的雪花之间，那里的高高的五层楼上，却令人眷念的闪着一个可爱的明窗；在舒适的屋子里，在得宜的脂油烛光和茶炊的沸腾音响的旁边，交换着温暖心神的意见，朗吟着上帝送给他所眷爱的俄国的一大批辉煌超妙的诗篇，许多青年的心，都颤动的潮涌起来，这在广大的南方的天宇下，是决不会有的。

田退德尼科夫立刻惯于他的职务了，然而这并不是他先前所想象的，合于他的宗旨的光荣的事业，倒是所谓第二义。他的办公只不过消磨时光，真的爱惜的却是其余的闲空的一瞬息。他的叔父现任四等官，刚以为侄子是还会好一点的，然而立刻碰了一个大钉子。我们在这里应该说明，在安特来·伊凡诺维支的许多朋友里面，有两个年青人，是属于所谓“脾气大”的人们一类的。他们俩都是古怪的不平稳的性格，不但对于不正不肯忍受，连对于他们看来好像不正的也决不肯忍受。天性并不坏，但他的行为却不伶俐，没秩序，自己对人非常之褊狭，一面却要别人凡事都万分的周详。他们的火一般的谈吐和对于社会的义愤的表示，给了田退德尼科夫一个强有力的影响。在交际中，他的神经也锐敏起来，觉得到极小的感触和刺戟了。他从他们学习了注意一切小事情，先前是并不措意的。菲陀尔·菲陀罗维支·莱尼金，是设在那堂皇的大厅里的一科的科长，忽然招了他的厌恶了。他觉得这莱尼金和上司说话，就简直变了一块糖，满脸浮着讨厌的甜腻腻的微笑，但转过来对着他的属下，却立刻摆出一副威严腔；而且也如凡是小人之流，总在留心的一样，有谁在大节日不到他家里去拜访，他总不会忘记把那人的姓名记在门房里的簿子上。于是他对他起了一种按捺不住的，近于切身的反感。好像有恶鬼在螫他，撩他似的，总想给菲陀尔·菲陀罗维支一个不舒服。他怀着秘密的高兴在等机会，也立刻就得到了。有一回，他对科长很粗暴，弄到当局要他去谢罪，或者就辞职。他就辞了职。他的叔父，现任四等官，骇的不得了，跑到他那里去恳求他道：“看上帝面上，安特来·伊凡诺维支！我求你！你这是怎么的？单为了看得一个上司不顺眼，你就把你全盘的幸而弄到手里的前程统统玩掉了！这是什么意思呀？如果谁都这么干，衙门里就要一个都不剩了。你明白一点罢……改掉你的虚矫之气和你的自负，到他那里去和他好好的说一说罢！”

“可是完全不是在这一点呵，亲爱的叔父。”那侄儿说。“向他去请求宽恕，我倒是毫不难办的。这实在是我的过失，他是我的上司，我不该向他这么的说话。然而事情却在这里：我还有一个别样的职务和别样的使命，我有三百个农奴，我的田地出息坏，我的管家又是一个傻子。如果衙门里叫别人补了我的缺，来眷写我的公文，国家的损失是并不很多的，但倘使三百个农奴缴不出他们的捐税，那损失可就很大了。请你想一想罢，我是地主呀，闲散的职业并不是我的事。如果我来用心于委任给我的农人的地位的保护和提高，给国家造成三百个有用的，谨慎和勤快的小百姓——那么，我的事情，还比一个什么科长莱尼金做得少吗？”

现任四等官吃了一吓，大张了嘴巴，这样的一番话，他是没有料到的。他想了一下，这才说出一点这种话：“不过……唉唉，你在怎么想呀？你不能把自己埋在乡下罢？农人可并不是你的前程呵！这里却两样，时常会遇见一个将军，或者一个公爵的。只要你高兴，你也可以走过那里的一所堂皇高敞的屋子。这里有煤气灯，有欧洲工业，都看得见！那里却只有村夫村妇。为什么你竟要把自己弄到那么无智识的人们里去了？”

然而叔父的这竭力晓谕的抗议和说明，对于侄儿并没有好影响。他觉得乡村乃是自由的幽栖，好梦和深思的乳母，有用之业的唯一的原野了。他早经收集了关于农业的最新的书籍。总而言之，在这番对话的两礼拜之后，他已在他年青时代曾经生活过的地方，使所有宾客非常惊叹的乡曲的附近了。一种全新的感情来激励他。他的心灵中，又觉醒了旧日的久已褪色的印象。许多地方，他是早经忘却了的，就很诧异的看着一路的美丽之处，仿佛一个生客。忽然间，为了一种莫名其妙的原因，他的心剧烈的跳动起来了。但道路进了大森林的茂密所形成的狭窄的隧道里，他只看见上上下下，各到各处，都是要三个人才能合抱的三百年老的槲树，其间夹杂些比普通的白杨长得还高的枞树，榆树和黑杨，他一问：“这森林是谁家的呢？”那回答是：“田退德尼科夫的。”于是道路出了森林，沿着白杨树丛，新柳树和老柳树，灌木，以及远处的连山前进，过了两条桥，时而走在河的左边，时而又在那右边，当旅人一问：“这牧场和这水地是谁家的呢？”那回答又是：“田退德尼科夫的。”路又引向山上，在高原中展开，经过了禾束，小麦，燕麦和大麦，一面是他曾经经过之处，又忽然远远的全盘出现了，道路愈走愈暗，入了密密的站在绿茵上面的横枝广远的树阴下，一直到了村边；当那饰着雕刻的农家小屋，石造府邸的红屋顶，亲密的迎面而来的时候，当那教堂的金色屋尖向他发闪的时候，他的猛跳的心，就是并不问，也知道自己是在那里了——于是他那愈涨愈高的感情，竟迸出这样的大声的话来道：“至今为止，我不是一个呆子吗？运命是选拔我来做世间的天国的主人，我却自贬了去充下贱的誊录，自去当死文字的奴才。我学得很多，受过严密的教育，通晓物情，有大识见，足够督励自己的下属，改良全体的田地，执行地主的许多义务，是萃管理人，执法官和秩序监督人于一身的！但是我跑掉了，把这职掌托付一个什么没教育，没资格的经理！自己却挑选了法院书记的职务，给漠不相识，也毫不知道那资质和性格的别人的讼事去着忙。我怎么能只去办那些单会弄出一大堆胡涂事的，离我怕有一千维尔斯他之远，而我也没有到过的外省的纸片上的空想的公事——来代我自己的田地的现实的公事呢？”

然而其时在等候他的还有一场别样的戏剧。农奴们一听到主人的归来，就都聚在府邸的大门口了。这些美丽人种的斑斓的围巾，带子，头巾，小衫和茂盛的如画的大胡子，挤满了他的周围。当百来个喉咙大叫道：“小爹！你竟也记得了我们了！”而年老的人们，还认识他的祖父和曾祖父的，不由的流出泪来的时候，他也禁不住自己的感动。他只好暗暗的追问：“有这样爱！我给他们办了些什么呀？我还没有见过他们，还没有给他们出过力哩！”于是他就立誓，从今以后，要和他们分任一切工作和勤劳了。

于是田退德尼科夫就很认真的来管理和经营他的田产。他削减地租，减少服役，给农奴们有为自己做事的较多的时间。胡涂经理赶走了，自己来独当一切。他亲自去到田野，去到谷仓，去到打禾场，去到磨场和河埠；也去看装货和三桅船的发送，这就已经使懒家伙窘得爬耳搔腮。然而这继续得并不久。农人是并不愚蠢的，他立刻觉得，主人实在是敏捷，聪明，而且喜欢做出能干的事情来，但还不大明白这应该怎样下手；而他的说话，也太复杂，太有教养。到底就弄成这模样，主人和农奴——这是说过一说的了：彼此全不了解，然而并不互相协同，学走一致的步调。

田退德尼科夫立刻觉察到，主人的田地上，什么都远不及农奴的田地上的收成好；种子撒得早，可是出得迟；不过也不能说人们做得坏。主人是总归亲自站在那里的，如果农奴们特别出力，还给他一杯烧酒喝。但是虽然如此，农奴那边的裸麦早已长足，燕麦成熟了，黍子长得很兴旺，他的却不过种子发了一点芽，穗子也没有饱满。一言以蔽之，主人觉得了他对于农奴，虽然全都平等，宽仁，但农奴对于他，却简直是欺骗。他试去责备那农奴，然而得到的是这样的答话：“您怎么能这样想，好老爷，说我们没有替主人的利益着想呢？您亲自看见的，我们怎样使劲的锄地呀下种——您还给我们一杯烧酒哩。”对于这，他还能回答些什么呢？

“那么，谷子怎会长得这么坏的呢？”主人问了下去。

“天知道！一定有虫子在下面咬罢！况且是这么坏的一夏天：连一点雨也没有。”

但主人知道，谷物的虫子是袒护农奴的，而且雨也下得很小心，就是所谓条纹式，只把好处去给农奴，主人的田地上却一滴也没有。

更艰难的是他的对付女人们。她们总在恳求工作的自由，和诉说服役的负担之苦。奇怪得很！他把她们的麻布，果实，香菌，胡桃那些的贡献品，统统废止了，还免掉了她们所有别样工作的一半，因为他以为女人们就会用了这闲空的时间，去料理家务，给自己的男人照顾衣服，开辟自家的菜园。怎样的一个错误呵！在这些美人儿之间，倒盛行了懒散，吵嘴，饶舌，以及各种争闹之类的事情，至于使男人们时时刻刻跑到主人这里来，恳求他道：“好老爷，请您叫那一个妈的娘儿清楚些！这真是恶鬼。和她是谁也过活不了的！”

他屡次克服了自己，要用严厉来做逃路。然而他怎么能做得出来呢！如果是一个女人，女人式的呼号起来，他怎么能够严厉呢？况且她又见得这么有病，可怜，穿着非常龌龊的，讨厌的破布片！（她从那里弄来的呢——那只有天晓得！）“去罢，离开我的眼前，给我用不着看见你！”可怜的田退德尼科夫大声说，立刻也就赏鉴了这女人刚出门口，就为了一个芜菁和邻女争闹起来，虽然生着病，却极有劲道的在脊梁上狠狠的给了一下，虽是壮健的农夫，也不能打的这么出色的。

很有一些时候，他要给他们办一个学校，然而这却吃了大苦，弄得非常消沉，垂头丧气，后悔他要来开办了。

他一去做调停人和和事佬，也即刻觉到了他那哲学教授传授给他的法律上的机微，简直没有什么用。这一边说假话，那一边谎也撒的并不少，归根结蒂，事件也只有魔鬼才了然。他知道了平常的世故，价值远胜于一切法律的机微和哲学的书籍；——他觉察了自己还有所欠缺，但缺的是什么呢，却只有上帝知道。而且发生了常常发生的事情：就是主人不明白农奴，农夫也不明白主人；而两方面，无论主人或农奴，都把错处推到别人身上去。这很冷却了地主的热中。现在他出去监督工作的时候，几乎完全缺少了先前那样的注意了。当收割牧草之际，他不再留心镰刀的微音，不去看干草怎样的堆积，怎样的装载，也不注意周围割草工作的进行。——他的眼睛只看着远方；一看见工作正在那边，那眼睛就在四近去找一种什么对象，或者看看旁边的河流的曲折，那地方有一个红腿红嘴的家伙，正在来回的散步——我说的自然是一只鸟，不是人；他新奇的凝视着翠鸟怎样在河边捕了一条鱼，衔在嘴里许多工夫，好像在沉思是否应该吞下去，再细心的沿河一望，就看见远地里另有一匹同类的鸟，还没有捉到鱼的，却在紧张的看着衔鱼的翠鸟。或者是闭了眼睛，仰起头，向着蔚蓝的天空，他的鼻子嗅着旷野的气息，耳朵是听着有翼的，愉快的歌人的歌吟，这从天上，从地下，集成一个神奇的合唱，没有噪音来搅乱那美丽的和谐：鹌鹑在裸麦中鼓翼，秧鸡在野草里钩辀，红雀四处飞鸣，一匹水鹬冲上空中，嘎的一声叫，云雀歌啭着，消在蔚蓝的天空中，而鹤唳就像鼓声，高高的在天上布成三角形的阵势。上下四方，无不作响，有声，而每一音响，都神奇的互相呼应……唉唉，上帝呵！你的世界，即使在荒僻的土地，在远离通都大邑的最小的村庄，也还是多么壮美呵！但到后来，虽是这些也使他厌倦了。他不久就完全不到野外去，从此只躲在屋子里，连跑来报告事情的经理人，也简直不想接见了。

早先还时时有一个邻居到他这里来谈天；什么退伍的骠骑兵中尉呀，是一位容易生气的吸烟家，浑身熏透着烟气，或者一位急进的大学生，大学并没有卒业，他的智慧是从各种应时的小本子和日报上采来的。但这也使他厌倦起来了。这些人们的谈话，立刻使他觉得很浅薄；他们那欧式恳切的，伶俐的举动，来敲一下他的膝盖那样的随便，他们的趋奉和亲昵，他看起来都以为太不雅，太显然。于是他决计和他们断绝往来，还用了很粗卤的方法。当一位大佐而且是快乐主义者一类货色的代表，现在是已经亡故了的专会浮谈的周到的交际家，和我们这里刚刚起来的新思想的先驱者瓦尔瓦尔·尼古拉耶维支·威锡涅坡克罗摩夫两个，同来访他，要和他畅谈政治，哲学，文学，道德，还有英国的经济情形的时候，他派了一个当差的去，嘱咐他说，主人不在家，而自己却立刻轻率的在窗口露了脸。主人和客人的眼光相遇了。一个自然是低声说：“这畜生！”别一个在齿缝里，也一样的送了他一个近乎畜生之类。他们的交情就从此完结。以后也不再有人来访他了。

他倒很喜欢，就潜心思索着他那关于俄国的大著作。怎样做法的呢——那是读者已经知道的了。他的家里传染了一种奇特的——随随便便的规矩。虽然人也不能说，他竟并无暂时梦醒的工夫。如果邮差把新的日报和杂志送到家里来，他读着碰到一个旧同学的姓名，或者出仕升到荣显的地位，或者对于科学的进步和全人类的事业有了供献，他的心就隐隐的发生一种幽微的酸辛，对于自己的无为的生活，起了轻柔的，沉默的，然而是严峻的不满。觉得他全部的存在，都恶心，讨厌了。久经过去的他的学校时代的光景，历历如在目前，亚历山大·彼得洛维支的形象，突然活泼的在面前出现，他的眼泪就泉涌起来……

这眼泪是表示什么的呢？恐怕是大受震撼的魂灵，借此来发抒他那烦恼的苦楚的秘密，他胸中蕴蓄着伟大高贵的人物，正想使他发达强壮起来，却中途受了窒碍的苦痛的罢？还没有试和运命的嫉妒相搏斗，他还未达到这样的成熟，学得使自己很高强，能冲决遮拦和妨碍；伟大而高华的感情的宝藏，未经最后的锻炼，就烧红的金属似的化掉了；对于他，那出色的教师真是死得太早，现在是全世界已没有一个人，具备才能，来振作这因怯弱而不绝的动摇，为反对所劫夺的无力的意志——用一句泼剌的话来使他奋起——一声泼剌的“前去”来号令精神了，这号令，是凡有俄国人，无论贵贱，不问等级，职业和地位，谁都非常渴望的。

能向我们俄国的魂灵，用了自己的高贵的国语，来号令这全能的言语“前去”的人在那里呢？谁通晓我们本质中的一切力量和才能，所有的深度，能用神通的一眼，就带我们到最高的生活去呢？俄国人会用了怎样的泪，怎样的爱来酬谢他呵！然而一世纪一世纪的驶去了，我们的男女沉沦在不成材的青年的无耻的怠惰和昏愚的举动里，上帝没有肯给我们会说这句全能的言语的人！

然而有一件事几乎使田退德尼科夫觉醒过来，在他的性格上发生一个彻底的转变。这是恋爱故事一类的，但也继续得并不久。在田退德尼科夫的邻村，离他的田地十维尔斯他之远，住着一个将军，这人，我们早经知道，批评田退德尼科夫是并不很好的。这位将军的过活，可真是一位将军，这就是说，恰像一位大人物，大开府第，喜欢前来拜访，向他致敬的邻人；他自己呢，自然是不去回拜的，一口粗嘎的声音，看着许多书，还有一个女儿，是稀奇的，异乎寻常的存在。她非常活泼有生气，好像她就是生活似的。

她的名字是乌理尼加，受过特别的教育。指授她的是一个一句俄国话也不懂的英国家庭教师。她的母亲很早就死掉了，父亲又没有常常照管她的余暇。但发疯似的爱着女儿，至于见得一味拼命的趋奉。她什么都惟我独尊，恰如一个放纵长大的孩子一样。倘使有谁见过她怎样忽然发怒，美丽的额上蹙起严峻的皱纹，怎样懊恼的和她的父亲争论，那是一定要以为她是世界上最任性的创造物的。但她的愤怒，只在听到了一件别人所遭遇的惨事或不平。她决不为了自己来发怒或纷争，也不为自己来辩解。一看见她所恼怒的人陷入不幸的困苦，她的气恼也就立刻消失了！有人来求她布施，她当即抛出整个的钱袋去，却并不仔细的想一想，这是对的呢还是不对的。她有些莽撞，急躁。说起话来，好像什么都在跟着思想飞跑：她那脸上的表情，她的言语，她的举动，她的一双手；连她的衣服的襞褶也仿佛在向前飘动，人几乎要想，她自己也和她的言语一同飞去了。她毫不隐瞒，对谁也不怕说出自己的秘密的思想，如果要说话，世界上就没有力量能够沉默她。她那惊人的步法，是一种惟她独具的，非常自由而稳重的步法，谁一相遇，就会不由自主的退到一旁，给她让出道路来。和她当面，坏人就总有些惶恐，沉默了。连最不怕羞的人也说不出话，失了所有的把握和从容，而老实人却立刻极其坦然的和她谈起闲天来，仿佛遇到了世间未见的人物，听过一句话，就好像他在什么地方，什么时候，曾经认识她，而且已在什么地方见过这一个相貌：是在他仅能依稀记得的童年，在自己的父亲的家里，在快乐的夜晚，在一群孩子高兴的玩着闹着的当时——从此以后许多时，壮龄的严肃和成就，就使他觉得凄凉了。

田退德尼科夫和她的关系，是也和一切别的人们完全一样的。一种新的，不可以言语形容的感情激励了他，一道明亮的光辉，照耀了他那单调的，凄凉的生活。

将军当初是很亲爱和诚恳的接待了田退德尼科夫的，但两人之间，竟不能弄到实在的融洽。每一见面，临了总是争论，彼此都怀着不舒服的感情；因为将军是不受反对和辩驳的。而田退德尼科夫这一面，可也是有些易于感动的年青人。他自然也为了他的女儿，常常对父亲让步，因此久没有搅乱彼此之间的平和，直到一个很好的日子，有将军的两位亲戚，一位是伯爵夫人皤尔提来瓦，一位是公爵夫人尤泻吉娜，前来访问的时候：这两位都曾经做过老女皇的宫中女官，但和彼得堡的大有势力的人物，也还有一点密切的关系的；将军就竭力活泼的向她们去凑奉。田退德尼科夫觉得她们一到，对他就很冷淡，不大注意，把他当哑子看待了。将军向他常用居高临下的口气；称他为“我的好人”或是“最敬爱的”，而有一回竟对他称了“你”。田退德尼科夫气恼起来了。他咬着牙齿，然而还知道用非常的自制力，保持着镇静，当怒不可遏，脸上飞红的时候，也用了很和气，很谦虚的声音回答道：“对于您的出格的好意，我是万分感谢的，军门大人。您用这亲昵的‘你’对我表示着密切的交情，我就对您也有了一样的称‘你’的义务。然而年纪的悬隔，却使我们之间，完全不能打这样亲戚似的交道呵！”将军狼狈了。他搜寻着自己的意思和适当的说法；终于声明了这“你”用的并不是这一种意思，老年人对于一个年青人，大约是可以称之为“你”的。关于他的将军的品级，却一句话也不说。

当然，两面的交际，自从这一事件以后，就彼此断绝了，他的爱情，也一发芽就凋落。暂时在他面前一闪的光明，黯然消灭，现在降临的昏暮，比先前更暗淡，更昏沉。他的生活又回上旧路，成了读者已经知道的那老样子了。他又整天无为的躺着。家里满是龌龊和杂乱。扫帚在屋子的中央，终日混在一堆尘埃里。裤子竟会在客厅里到处游牧，安乐椅前面的华美的桌子上，放着几条垢腻的裤带，像是对于来宾的赠品似的。田退德尼科夫的全部生活，就这样的无聊，昏沉起来，不但他的仆役不再敬畏，连鸡也肆无忌惮的来啄他了。他会许多工夫，拿着笔，坐在那里，在摊在面前的一张纸上画着各种图：饼干，房屋，小屋，小车，三驾马车等。有时还会忘掉了一切，笔在纸上简直自动起来，在主人的无意中，形成一个娇小的头脸，是优秀动人的相貌，流利探索的眼光和一个微微蜷曲的髻子——于是画家就惊疑的凝视，这是那人的略画，那肖像是没有一个美术家能够摹绘的。他心里就越加伤痛起来；他不愿意再相信这世界上会有幸福，因此也比先前更其悲哀，更少说话了。这样的是安特来·伊凡诺维支·田退德尼科夫的心情。有一天当他照例的坐在窗前，望着前园时，忽然惊疑不定，是觉得既不见格力戈黎，也不见贝菲利耶夫娜，下面却只是一种不安和扰动了。

青年的厨子和管家女都跑出去开大门；门一开，就看见三匹马，和刻在凯旋门上的完全一样的。一匹的头在左，一匹在右，一匹是在中间。这上面高高的君临着一个马夫和一个家丁，宽大的衣服，头上包一块手帕。两人之后坐着一位外套和皮帽的绅士，满满的围着红色的围巾。当马车停在门口的阶前时，就显出这原来是一辆有弹簧的轻巧的车子。那一表非凡的绅士，就以仿佛军人似的敏捷和熟练，跳出车子，匆匆的跑上阶沿来了。

安特来·伊凡诺维支着了急。他以为来客是一位政府的官员。到这里我应该补叙一下，他在年青时候，是受过一件傻事情的连累的。有一对读过一大批时下小本子的哲学化的骠骑兵官，一位进了大学，却未卒业的美学家，和一个败落的赌客要设立一个慈善会，会长是一个秘密共济会员，也爱打牌的老骗子，然而口才极好的绅士。这会藏着一种非常高尚的目的：就是要使从泰姆士河边到亢卡德加的全人类永远得到幸福。但这须有莫大的现钱，从大度的会员们募集的捐款，是闻所未闻的大。这钱跑到那里去了呢，除了掌握指导之权的会长以外，自然谁也不知道。田退德尼科夫是由两个朋友拉进这会里去的；那两个都是属于满肚牢骚类的人，天性是善良的，为了科学为了教化，以及为了给人类服务的他们的未来的壮举，喝了许许多干杯，于是就成为正式的酒鬼了。田退德尼科夫觉察的还早，退了会。但这会却已经玩了一个上等人不很相宜的另外的花样，招出不愉快的结果来，竟闹到警察局去了……田退德尼科夫退会之后，就和这些人断绝了一切的交涉，但还不能觉得很放心，也是毫不足怪的：他的良心并不完全清净。所以他现在瞥见大门一开放，就不能不吃惊。

但当来客几乎出人意外的老练地一鞠躬，一面微微的侧着头，作为致敬的表示的时候，他的焦急立刻消散了。那人简短地，然而清楚地声明，他从很久的以前起，就一半为了事务，一半为了嗜奇，在俄国旅行：即使不计那些有余的产业和多种的土壤，我们的国度里也很富于显著的东西；他是给这田地的出色的位置耸动了，但倘若他的马车没有因为这春天的泛滥和难走的道路忽然出了毛病，他是决不敢到这美丽之处来惊动主人的；就为了想借铁匠的高手给修理一下。然而即使马车全没有出什么事，他也还是禁不住要趋前来请安的。

那客人一说完话，就又可爱到迷人的一鞠躬，露出他那珠扣的华美的磁漆长靴来，而且他的身子虽然肥胖，却以橡皮球的弹性，向后跳退了几步。

安特来·伊凡诺维支早已放心了；他认为这人该是一个好奇的学者或是教授，旅行俄国，在采集植物或者也许倒是稀奇的化石的。他立刻声明了对于一切事情，自己都愿意协助，请他用自己的车匠和铁匠来修理马车，请他像在他自己的家里一样，在这里休息，请他坐在一把宽大的服尔德式安乐椅子(3)上，要倾听他那博学的，关于自然科学的物事的谈话了。

然而那客人所讲的却多是内心生活的事情。他把自己的生涯，比作一只小船，在大海里，被怕人的风暴所吹送；说，他怎样的屡次变换了职业，他多少次为真理受苦，以及他怎样的屡次被敌人所暗算，生命几濒于危险，此外还有许多别的事，于是田退德尼科夫看出来了，他的客人乃是一个实际家。收场是他把一块雪白的麻纺手巾按在鼻子上，大声的擤了一下鼻涕，响到安特来·伊凡诺维支从来没有听到过。在交响乐里，是往往会遇到这种讨厌的喇叭的；如果只有这一声，却令人觉得并不在交响乐里，倒是自己的耳朵在发响。在久经沉睡的府邸中的突然惊醒的许多屋子里，立刻轰传了一样的声音，而立刻也在空气中充满了可伦香水的芳烈的气息，这是由麻纺手帕的轻轻一挥，隐隐约约的散在屋里的。

读者恐怕已经猜到，这客人并非别个，即是我们那可敬的，长久没有顾到了的保甫尔·伊凡诺维支·乞乞科夫。他老了一点了：可见他的过活，也并非没有狂风骇浪。就是他穿着的常礼服，也显得有些穿熟的样子；连那马夫和篷车，家丁，马匠和马具，看去都好像有一点减损和消耗了。他的经济景况似乎也并不很出色。但那脸面的表情，行为的优雅，恰依然全如先前一样。是的，他的应酬，倒比以前更可爱了一些，坐在安乐椅子上的时候，也还是架起了一条腿。谈吐近乎更加柔软，言语之间，也仿佛愈在留心和节制，态度是更聪明，更稳重，在一切举动上，几乎更加能干了。他的衣领和胸衣是雪似的又白又亮，虽然在旅行，外衣上却不沾一粒灰尘：他可以立刻去赴庆祝生日的筵宴。下巴和面颊都刮得极光，只有瞎子，才会不惊叹他那饱满和圆滑的。

府邸里立刻起了很大的变化：因为关着外层门，久已躲在昏暗中的一半，突然照得光明耀眼了。在很亮的屋子里，摆起家具来，一切就马上显得这模样：作为卧室的屋子，陈列着各种夜晚化妆应用的东西，做书房的一间……等一等罢，我们先应该知道这屋子里摆着三张的桌子：一张是沙发前面的书桌，一张是镜子和窗门之间的打牌桌，还有一张是屋角上的三角桌，正在卧室的门和通到堆积破烂家具，不住人的大厅的门的中间。这大厅，向来是充作前厅之用的，已经整年的没有人进去过。在这三角桌子上，那旅客从衣箱里发出来的衣裳就找到了它的位置，便是：两条配着那件常礼服用的裤子，两条簇新的裤子，两条灰色的裤子，两件绒背心，两件绸背心和一件常礼服。这些都积叠了起来，像一座金字塔，上面盖一块绢手帕。在房门和窗门之间的别一个屋角上呢，排着一大批长靴：一双不很新的，一双完全新的，一双磁漆鞋和一双睡鞋。这些上面也怕羞似的盖着一块绢帕——简直好像并无其物的一样。书桌上也立刻整整齐齐的摆出这些东西来：小匣子，一个装有可伦香水的瓶儿，一个日历和两种小说，但两种都只有第二本。干净的小衫裤，是放在卧室里的衣橱里面了；要给洗衣女人去洗的那些，就捆成一团，塞在床底下。连那衣箱，到得发空之后，也塞进床底下去了。为了吓跑强盗和偷儿，一路带着的长刀，也拿进卧室去，挂在靠近眠床的一个钉头上。什么都见得了不得的干净，异乎寻常的整齐了。那里都找不出一片纸，一根毛或者一粒尘埃了。连空气也显得美好起来：其中散布着一个小衫裤常常替换，礼拜天一定要去用湿海绵洗澡的鲜活而健康的男子汉的令人舒服的气味。在充作前厅之用的大厅里，一时也粘住了家丁彼得尔希加的气息，但彼得尔希加又即搬家，这正和他相称，弄到厨房里去了。

在第一天，安特来·伊凡诺维支很有些为自己的无拘无束担心；他怕这客人会烦扰他，带累他的生活有不惬意的变化，扰乱他自己幸而立定了的日课，但他的担心是毫无根据的。我们的朋友保甫尔·伊凡诺维支却显示了适应一切的简直非凡的弹性和才能。他称扬主人的哲学气味的悠闲，并且说明这可以使人长寿。关于他的孤独生活，是赞成的说，这对于人，乃是养成伟大思想的。也看了一看图书室，把书籍赞美非常，还指出这可以防人的误入歧路。他话说的很少，但凡有所说，却无不真切，而且分明。一切举动，尤其证明着可爱和伶俐。进退都适得其时，不把质问和愿望来麻烦主人，如果是这边沉默着，不爱谈天的话；也很满足的来下一盘棋，也很满足的不开口，当主人把烟草的烟云喷向空中时，他不吸烟，就来找一件相称的事情：举个例子，就如他从袋子里摸出土拉银的烟盒来，钳在右手的两个指头的中间，再用左手的一个指头拨得它飞快的旋转起来，简直好像地球的转着自己的轴子，或者用手指咚咚的敲着盖子，再加口哨吹出谐和的声调。一句话，他一点也不妨碍他的主人。“在一生中，这才看见了一个可以一同过活的人！”田退德尼科夫对自己说。“这种本领，在我们这里实在是很少有的。我们里面有许多人：聪明，有教养，也确是好人，然而永远稳妥的人，可以同住一世纪，并不争闹的人——这样的人我却不知道。这一种人，我们这里到底有多少呢？这是我所认识的这类人的第一个。”田退德尼科夫这样的判断着他的客人。

乞乞科夫那一面也很高兴，因为他能够在一个这么温和而恳切的主人家里，寄住若干的时光。流浪人的生活，他实在尝饱了。能够好好的住下一个月，欣赏着出色的村庄的风景，田野的气味和开始的春光，就是为痔疮起见，也有大用处和利益的。

轻易就找不出给他休息的更好的地方来。春天战胜了压迫的严寒，骤然展开那全部的华美，幼小的生命到处抽芽了。树林和牧场都闪出淡绿，嫩草的新鲜的碧玉里，明晃晃的抽着蒲公英的黄花，还有红紫的白头翁花，也温顺的垂着纤柔的颈子。成群的蚊虻和许多昆虫，都在沼泽上出现，跟着的是长脚的水黾，于是禽鸟也从各方面来躲在干枯的，可以遮蔽的芦苇里。一切都潮涌似的聚集在这地方，彼此互相见面，互相亲近了。地上忽然增添了丁口。树林觉醒起来，牧场上是活泼而且响动。村子里跳着圆舞。还有多少地方是闲空的呢。怎样的明朗的新绿！空气是多么的清新！园里是多少禽鸟的歌吟！万有的天上似的欢呼和高兴！村庄在发声，在歌唱，好像结婚的大宴了。

乞乞科夫时常去散步。出去游行和漫步的机会是多得很的。他直上平坦的高原，可眺望横在下面的溪谷，到处还有啮岸的洪水所留下的大湖，其中耸着幽暗的，尚未生叶的树林的岛屿；或者是穿过暗林的密处和阴地的中间，树木戴着鸟巢，接近的屹立着，乌鸦叫着乱飞起来，好像一片云遮暗了天宇。从燥地上可以一径走到埠头，装着豌豆，大麦和小麦的初次的船刚要开行，流水激着慢慢的转动起来，水车轮发出震聋耳朵的声响。或者他去看看方才开始的春耕，观察一块新耕的土地，怎样展在原野的碧绿里，还有播种的人，用手敲着挂在胸前的筛子，匀整的撒出种子去，却没有一粒落在别地方。

乞乞科夫什么地方都走到。他和管家，农夫，磨工样样的议论，谈天。他什么都问到，问那里和怎样，还问怎样的营生，卖掉了多少谷子，春天和秋天磨什么谷子，每个农奴叫什么名字，谁和谁有亲，他从那里买了他的公牛，他用什么喂他的猪子，总而言之，他一点也不漏落。他也问出了死掉多少农奴，知道是好像少得很。因为他是聪明人，立刻明白了安特来·伊凡诺维支的家景并不很出色。他到处发见了怠慢，懒惰，偷盗，还有纵酒也很风行，他自己想：“田退德尼科夫可多么胡涂呀！这样的产业！却一点也不管！从这里赚出总额五万卢布来，是可以把得稳的！”

在散步时，他不止一回，起了这样的思想，自己也在什么时候——当然并非现在，却在将来，如果办妥要务，他手里有了钱的话——自己也在什么时候要做一个像这产业的平和的主人。于是不消说，立刻有一个商家的，或是别的有钱人家的，粉面的年青而娇滴滴的女人的形象，在他眼前出现。唔，他竟还梦想她是性情和音乐相近的哩。他也设想着后代，他的子孙，那责任，是在传乞乞科夫氏于无穷：一个泼剌的男孩和一个漂亮的女孩，或者简直是两个男孩和两个女孩，当然，三个也可以，由此给大家知道知道，他的确生活过，存在过，至少是并不像一个幽灵或者影子似的在地上逛荡了一下——而且他对于祖国，因此也用不着惭愧了。于是就往往起了这一种思想，那也并不坏，如果他有了头衔的话：例如五等官。这总是一个很有名誉，很可尊敬的称号呀！人如果去散步，是什么都会想起来的：非常之多，至于把人从这无聊的，凄凉的现在拉开，挑拨他的幻想力，加以戏弄，使他活动，纵使他明知道做不到，在他自己却还是觉得甜蜜的。

乞乞科夫的仆役也很中意了这地方。他们很快的习惯了新生活。彼得尔希加立刻和侍者格力戈黎结了交，虽然他们俩开初都很矜持，而且非常之装模作样。彼得尔希加想蒙蔽格力戈黎，用自己的游历和世界知识使他肃然起敬，但格力戈黎却马上用了彼得尔希加没有到过的彼得堡制了胜。他还要用那些地方的非常之远来对抗，而格力戈黎可就说出这样的一个地方来，谁都决不能在地图上找到，而且据说还远在三千维尔斯他以上，弄得保甫尔·伊凡诺维支的家丁无法可想，只好张开了嘴巴，遭所有奴婢的哄笑了。但相处却很合式；两个家丁订结了亲密的交情。村边有一个出名的小酒店，是一切农奴的老伯伯，秃头的庇门开设的，店名叫作“亚勒苦以卡”。在这店堂里，每天总可以见到他们。所以用人民爱用的话来说，他们是成了酒店的“老主顾”了。

给绥里方却有另外的乐处。村子里是每晚上都唱歌；村里的年青人聚集起来，用歌唱和跳舞来庆祝新春；跳着圆舞，合围了，又忽然分散。在现在的大村子里是已经很少有了的苗条而血统纯粹的，招人怜爱的姑娘们，给了他一个强有力的印象，至于久立不动，看得入迷。共中谁最漂亮呢，那可很难说！她们都是雪白的胸脯和颈子，又大又圆的含蓄的眼睛，孔雀似的步子，一条辫发，一直拖到腰带边。每当她那洁白的双手拉着他的手，在圆阵中和她们徐徐前进，或者和别的青年们排成一道墙，向她们挤过去的时候，每当姑娘们高声大笑着，向他们迎上来，并且唱着“新郎在那里呢，主人呀？”的时候，每当周围都沉入黑夜中，那谐调的回声，远从河流的后边，忧郁的反响过来的时候，他就几乎忘却了自己。此后许多时：无论是在早上或是黄昏，是在睡着或是醒着——他总觉得好像有一双雪白的手捏在自己的两手里，和她们在圆阵里慢慢的动弹。

乞乞科夫的马匹也觉得在它们的新住宅里好得很。青马，议员，连花马在内，也以为留在田退德尼科夫这里毫不无聊，燕麦是很出色的，而马房的形势，也极其适意。每匹都有各自的位置，用隔板和别的分开，然而又很容易从上面窥探。所以也能够看见别的马，如果从中有一匹，即使是在最末的边上的，高兴嘶起来了，那么，别匹也就可以用同样的方法，来回答它的同僚。

总而言之，在田退德尼科夫这里，谁都马上觉得像在自己的家里了。但一涉及保甫尔·伊凡诺维支因此游行着广大的俄国的事务，就是死魂灵，关于这一点，他却纵使和十足的呆子做对手，也格外谨慎和干练了。然而田退德尼科夫总是在看书，在思索，要查明一切现象的原因和底蕴——它们的为着什么和什么缘故……“不，我从别一面下手，也许要好一些罢！”乞乞科夫这样想。他时常和婢仆去谈闲天，于是他有一回，知道了主人先前常常到一家邻居——一位将军——那里去做客，知道了那将军有一个女儿，知道了主人对于那小姐——而小姐对于主人也有一点……知道了但他们忽然断绝，从此永远不相来往了。而他自己也早经觉到，安特来·伊凡诺维支总在用铅笔或毛笔画着种种头，但是全都见得非常相像的。

有一天，午餐之后，他又照例的用了第二个指头，使银烟盒依轴而转的时候，向着田退德尼科夫道：“凡是心里想要的东西，您什么都有，安特来·伊凡诺维支；只是您还缺一样。”

“那是？”这边问，一面在空中喷出一团的烟云。

“一个终身的伴侣。”乞乞科夫说。安特来·伊凡诺维支没有回答，于是这回的谈话，就此收场了。

乞乞科夫却并不害怕，寻出一个另外的时机来——这回是在晚餐之前——当谈天的中途，突然说：“真的，安特来·伊凡诺维支，您得结婚了！”

然而田退德尼科夫仍旧一句话也不回答，仿佛他不爱这个题目似的。

但是，乞乞科夫不退缩。他第三次选了一个别样的时机，是在晚餐之后说了这些话：“唔，真的，无论从那一方面来看您的生活，我总以为您得结婚了！您还会生忧郁症呢。”

也许是乞乞科夫的话这回说得特别动听，也许是安特来·伊凡诺维支这时特别倾于直率和坦白，他叹息一声，并且说，一面又喷出一口烟：“第一着，是人总该有幸福，总该有运气的，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支。”于是他很详细的对他讲述了自己的遭遇：他和将军的结交以及他们的绝交的全部的故事。

当乞乞科夫一句一句的明白了已经知道的案件，听到那只为一句话儿“你”，却闹出这么大故事来的时候，他简直骇了一跳。暂时之间，他查考似的看着田退德尼科夫的眼睛，决不定他是十足的呆子呢，还不过稍微有一点昏。

“安特来·伊凡诺维支！我请教您！”他终于说，一面捏住了主人的两只手，“这算什么侮辱呢？在‘你’这个字里，您找得出什么侮辱来呢？”

“这字的本身里自然是并不含有侮辱的，”田退德尼科夫回答道，“侮辱是在说出这字来的意思里，表现里。‘你！’——这就是说：‘知道罢，你是一个无足重轻的东西；我和你来往，只因为没有比你好的人；现在是公爵夫人尤泻吉娜在这里了，我请你记一记那里是你本来的地位，站到门口去罢。’就是这意思呀！”说到这里，我们的和气的，温顺的安特来·伊凡诺维支的眼睛就发光；在他的声音里，颤动着出于大受侮辱的感情的愤激。

“唔，如果竟是这一类的意思呢？——那有什么要紧呀？”乞乞科夫说。

“怎么，您要我在这样的举动之后，还去访问他吗？”

“是的，这算得什么举动？这是决不能称为一种举动的。”乞乞科夫极冷静的说。

“怎么会不是‘举动’的？”田退德尼科夫诧异的问道。

“总之这不是举动，安特来·伊凡诺维支。这不过是这位军门大人的这样一种习惯，对谁都这么称呼。况且对于一位这样的给国家出过力，可以尊敬的人物，为什么不宽恕他一下呢？”

“这又是另一件事了，”田退德尼科夫说，“如果他只是一个老先生或者一个穷小子，不这么浮夸，骄傲和锋利，如果他不是将军，那么，就是用‘你’来称呼我，我也很愿意宽恕，而且还要恭恭敬敬的应对的。”

“实实在在，他是一个呆子！”乞乞科夫想。“他肯宽恕一个破烂衣服的家伙，对于一位将军倒不！”在这料想之后，他就大声的说下去道：“好，可以，就是了，算是他侮辱您罢，但是您也回报他：他侮辱您了，您也还了他侮辱。然而人怎么可以为了一点这样的芥蒂，就大家分开，抛掉个人藏在心里的事情呢？我应该先求原谅，这真是……如果您立定了目标，那么，您也应该向这奔过去，有什么要来吗，来就是。谁还留心有人在对人吐唾沫呢？一切的人，都在互相吐唾沫。现在是您在全世界上，也找不出一个人，会不周围乱打，也不对人吐唾沫了。”

田退德尼科夫被这些话吓了一大跳，他完全目瞪口呆的坐着，单是想：“一个太古怪的人，这乞乞科夫！”

“是一个稀奇的家伙，这田退德尼科夫！”乞乞科夫想，于是他放声说下去道：“安特来·伊凡诺维支，请您给我像对兄弟似的来说一说罢。您还毫无经验。您要原谅我去弄明白这件事。我要去拜访大人，向他说明，这件事在您这边是由于您的误会，原因还在您年纪青，您的世界知识和人间知识都很有限。”

“我没有到他面前去爬的意思，”田退德尼科夫不高兴的说，“也不能托付给您的！”

“我也没有爬的本领，”乞乞科夫不高兴的回答道，“我只是一个人。我会犯错误，但是爬呢——断断不来的！请您原谅罢，安特来·伊凡诺维支；您竟有权利，在我的话里垫进这么侮辱的意义去，我可是没有料到的。”

“您宽恕罢，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，我错了！”田退德尼科夫握着乞乞科夫的两只手，感激的说。“我实在并不想侮辱您。您的好意，在我是极有价值的。我对您起誓。但我们收起这话来，我们不再要来谈这件事罢！”

“那么，我也就平平常常的到将军那里去罢。”乞乞科夫说。

“为什么？”田退德尼科夫问，一面诧异的凝视着乞乞科夫。

“我要去拜访他！”乞乞科夫道。

“这乞乞科夫是一个多么古怪的人呵！”田退德尼科夫想。

“这田退德尼科夫是一个多么古怪的人呵！”乞乞科夫想。

“我明天早上十点钟的样子到他那里去，安特来·伊凡诺维支。我想，去拜访一位这样的人物，表示自己的敬意，还是早一点好。只可惜我的马车还没有整顿，我想请您允许我用一用您的车子。我豫备早晨十点钟就到他那里去的！”

“自然可以。这算得什么！您吩咐就是。您爱用那一辆，就用那一辆，都随您的便！”

在这交谈之后，他们就走散，各归自己的房子，睡觉去了，彼此也并非没有推测着别人的思想的特性。

但是——这岂不奇怪，当第二天马车到门，乞乞科夫身穿新衣服，白背心，结着白领带，以军人似的熟练，一跳而上，驶了出去，拜访将军去了的时候——田退德尼科夫就起了一种好像从未体验过的感动。他那一切生锈和昏睡的思想，都不安起来，活动起来。神经性的激情，忽然用了全力，把这昏沉的，浸在舒服和无为中的迷梦，一扫而空了。

他忽而坐在沙发上，忽而走向窗口去，忽而拿起一本书，忽而又想思索些什么事。失掉的爱的苦恼呵！他找不出思想来。或者他想什么也不想。枉然的辛苦呵！一种思想的无聊的零星，各种思想的尾巴和断片，都闯进脑子里，搅扰着他的头颅。“这情形可真怪！”他说着，坐在窗前，眺望道路去了，道路穿过昏暗的槲树林，林边分明有一阵烟尘，是驶去的马车卷了起来的。但是，我们抛下田退德尼科夫，我们跟定乞乞科夫罢。

第二章


在十足的半个钟头里，出色的马匹就把乞乞科夫拉了大约十维尔斯他之远——先过槲树林，其次是横在新耕的长条土地之间的，夸着春天新绿的谷物的田地，其次又沿了时时刻刻展开着堂皇的远景的连山——终于是经过了刚在吐叶的菩提树的宽阔的列树路，直到将军的领地里。菩提树路立刻变成一条两面白杨的长路，树身都围着四方的篱笆，后来就到透空铸铁的大门，可以窥见府邸的八个珂林德式的圆柱，支着华美的破风，雕镂得非常精美。到处发着油漆气，全部给人新鲜之感，没有一样东西显得陈旧。前园是平坦而且干净，令人觉得就要变成地板。当马车停在门前时，乞乞科夫就十分恭敬的跳了下来，走上阶沿去。他立刻把名片送到将军那里，而且又即被引进书斋里去了。将军的威严相貌，可给了我们的主角一个很深的印象。他穿一件莓子红的一声不响的天鹅绒的睡衣，他的眼色是坦白的，他的脸相是有丈夫气的，他有一大部唇须，茂盛而花白的颊须和头发，背后剪得很短；他的颈子，又宽又肥，也就是我们这里之所谓“三层楼”，意思是那上面有横走的三条皱，一言以蔽之，这是一八一二年顷非常之多的豪华的将军标本的一个。这位贝得理锡且夫将军，是也如我们大家一样，有一大堆优点和缺点的。在我们俄国人里面也常常可以看到，这两点实在交织的非常陆离光怪：豁达，大度，临到要决断的时候，也果决，明白，然而一到他居高无事，以及没有事情来惹他了，那就也如没有一个俄国人能够破例一样，要夹上一大批虚荣，野心，独断和小气。凡有品级超过了他的，他都非常之厌恶，对他们发表一些冷话也似的东西。最遭殃的是他的一个先前的同僚，因为将军确信着自己的明白和干练，都在那人之上，而那人却超过了自己，已经做了两省的总督。还有一样晦气的事情，是将军的田产，又正在他的同僚所管的一省里。将军就屡次的复仇；一有机会，他就讲起自己的对手，批评他的一切命令。说明他的一切办公和行政，都是胡涂透顶。他什么都显得有些所谓古怪，尤其是在教养上。他是一个革新的好朋友和前驱；也总在愿意比别人知道得更多，知道得更好，所以他不喜欢知道看一点什么他所没有知道的东西的人。总而言之，他是很爱夸耀自己的聪明的。他的教育，大半从外国得来，然而又要摆俄国的贵人架子。性格上既然有这么多的固执，这么多的厉害的冲突，做起官来，自然只好和不如意打仗，终于也弄得自己告退了。闹成这样的罪孽，他却归之于一个所谓敌党，因为他是没有负点责任的勇气的。告退以后，他仍旧保存着堂堂的威风。无论他穿着一件燕尾服，一件常礼服，或者一件睡衣——他总是这模样。从他的声音起，一直到一举一动，无不是号令和威严，使他的一切下属，即使并非尊敬，至少也要觉得害怕或胆怯。

乞乞科夫觉到了两样：敬重和胆怯。他恭敬的微歪了头，好像要搬一个载着茶杯的盘子似的，伸出两只手去，用了出奇的熟练，鞠躬快要碰到地面上，并且说道：“前来恭候大人，我以为是自己的义务。对于在战场上救了祖国的人们的道德，抱着至高的尊敬，所以使我，使我来拜见您老了。”

这几句开场白，在将军似乎并没有什么不满意。他很和气的点点头，说道：“和您相识，我是很高兴的。请，您请坐！您是在那里办公的呀？”

“我的办事的地方，”乞乞科夫说，一面坐在安乐椅子上——但并非中央，却在微微靠边的一面——而且用手紧抓着椅子的靠手，“我的办事的地方，是在国库局开头的，大人，后来就就过种种的位置；我在地方审判厅，在一个建筑委员会，在税务处，都办过公。我的生涯，就像一只小船，在狂风巨浪中间一样，大人。我可以说，我是用忍耐喂养大的，我自己就是所谓忍耐的化身。我吃了敌人的多少苦呢，这是用言语，就是用艺术家的画笔，也都描写不来的。现在到了晚年，这才在寻一个角落，好做一个窠，给自己过活。这回是就住在您大人的近邻的人家……”

“谁家呢，如果我可以问？”

“在田退德尼科夫家，大人。”

将军皱起了眉头。

“他是在非常懊悔，没有向您大人来表示当然的尊敬的。”

“尊敬！为什么？”

“为了您大人的勋业。”乞乞科夫说。“不过他找不出适当的话来……他说：‘只要我能够给军门大人做点什么……因为我是知道尊重救了祖国的人物的。’他说。”

“我，那么，他想怎样？……我可是毫不怪他呵！”将军说着，已经和气得远了。“我是真心喜欢他的，还相信他一到时候，会成一个很有用的人呢。”

“说的真对，大人。”乞乞科夫插嘴道。“一个很有用的人，他很有口才，文章也写得非常之好。”

“但我想，他是写着种种无聊东西的。我想，他是在做诗或者这一类罢。”

“并不是的，大人，全不是无聊的东西。他在做一部极切实，极紧要的著作。他在做……一部历史，大人……”

“一部历史？……什么历史？”

“一部历史……”到这里，乞乞科夫停了一下，不知道是因为有一位将军坐在眼前，还不过是想要加重这事情的力量呢，总之，他又接着道，“一部将军们的历史，大人！”

“什么？将军们的？怎样的将军们的？”

“将军们一般，大人，就是全体的将军们……也就是，切实的说起来，是祖国的将军们的。”

乞乞科夫觉得自己岔得太远了，因此非常惶惑。他恨得要吐唾沫，一面自己想：我的上帝，我在说怎样的昏话呵。

“请您原谅，我还没有全懂……那究竟是怎么的呀？那是或一时代的历史，还是各人的传记呢？还有：写的是现存的所有的将军们，还是只取那参与过一八一二年的战事的呢？”

“对得很，大人，只是那参加战事的！”一面却自己想道：“打死我罢，我可说不清！”

“哦，那么，他为什么不到我这里来的？我可以给他非常有味的史料哩！”

“他不敢，大人！”

“多么胡涂！为了彼此之间有什么一句傻话……我可全不是这样的人呵。我自己到他那里去也可以的。”

“这他可不敢当，他自己会来的。”乞乞科夫说，他已经完全恢复了元气，自己想道：“哼，将军们！可来的真凑巧；然而这全是我随口滑出来的！”

在将军的书斋里，听到一种声音。雕花框子的胡桃木门，自己开开了。门背后出现了一个闺女的活泼的姿色，手捏着房门的把手，即使在屋子的昏暗的背景上忽而显出了被灯火映得雪亮的照相也不及这可爱的丰姿的突然涌现，给人这么强有力的印象。她分明是因为要说什么话，走了进来的，但一看见屋子里有一个陌生人……好像和她一同涌进了太阳的光线，将军的森严的房屋，也仿佛全部灿烂起来，微笑起来了。在最初的一瞬间，乞乞科夫竟猜不出站在他面前的是什么人。她是生在那一国度里的呢，也很难断定，因为这么纯净而优美的相貌，是并不能够轻易找到的，即使在古代的浮雕玉石上。她那高华的全体，苗条而轻捷像一枝箭，显得比一切都高一些。然而这只是一种美的错觉。她其实并不很高大。这种现象，不过由于她的肢体，彼此无不出奇的融洽和均匀。那衣服，她所穿的，也和她的身样非常相称，令人要以为因为想给她做得极好，最有名的裁缝们曾经会议一番的。然而这也只是一种错觉。她并不考究自己的装饰，什么都好像自然而然的一样：只要在单色的匆匆裁好的布片上，用针缝上两三处，就自然成功了称身的高华的襞褶；倘将这衣裳和它的穿着人一同移在绘画上，那么，一切时髦的年青闺秀，就见得好像花母牛，或是旧货店里的美人儿了。倘将她连这襞褶和所穿的衣裳一同凿在白石上，那么，人就要称这雕像为天才的艺术家的作品的。她只有一个缺点：是她有些过于瘦弱和纤柔。

“我来给您介绍我的搅家精罢！”将军说着，转向乞乞科夫这面去。“还要请您原谅，我还没有知道您的本名和父称哩……”

“对于一个还没有表见一点特色和德行的人，也得知道那本名和父称吗？”乞乞科夫谦虚的歪着头，回答道。

“但是……这一点是总该知道的！”

“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，大人！”乞乞科夫说着，一面用了军人似的熟练，鞠一个躬，又用了橡皮球似的弹力，向后跳了一下。

“乌理尼加！”将军接着道，“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支刚告诉了我很有意思的新闻。我们邻人田退德尼科夫可全不是像我们所想那样的傻子。他在做一部大著作：一部一八一二年的将军们的历史哩。”

“哦，但是谁说他是傻的呀？”她很快的说。“至多，也不过是你很相信的那个米锡内坡克罗摩夫会这么说，爸爸，而他却不过一个空虚而卑劣的人呀。”

“怎么就卑劣？他有些浮浅，那是真的！”将军说。

“他有点卑劣，也有点坏，不单是浮浅的。谁能这样的对付自己的兄弟，还把他的同胞姊妹从家里赶出去呢，这是一个讨厌的，可恶的人！”

“然而这不过是人们讲说他的话。”

“人们不会无缘无故的说出这样的事来的。我真不懂你，爸爸。你有一颗少有的好心，但你却会和一个万不及你，你也明知道他不好的人打交道。”

“你瞧就是，”将军微笑着对乞乞科夫说，“我们是总在这么吵架的！”于是他又转向乌理尼加去，接着道：“亲爱的心儿！我可不能赶出他去呀！”

“为什么就赶出去？但也用不着招待得这么恭敬，像要把他抱在你的怀里似的呀！”

到这里，乞乞科夫以为也来说句话，已是他的义务了。

“每个生物都在求爱，”乞乞科夫道，“这教人有什么办法呢？连兽类也爱人去抚摩它，它从槛房里伸出鼻子来，仿佛想要说：来呀，摩摩我。”

将军笑起来了。“真对，就是这样的。它伸出鼻子来，恳求着：在这里呢。摩摩我！哈，哈，哈！不单是鼻子哩，整个人都从龌龊东西里钻上来，然而他却求人表示所谓同情……哈，哈，哈！”将军笑得发了抖。他那曾经搁过肥厚的肩章的双肩，在抖动，好像现在也还饰着肥厚的肩章的一样。

乞乞科夫也短声的笑起来，但因为对于将军的尊敬，他的笑总不张开口：嘻，嘻，嘻，嘻，嘻，嘻！(1)他也笑得发了抖，不过肩膀没有动，因为他并不缀着肥厚的肩章。

“这么一个先是欺骗和偷窃国家的家伙，却还想人因此来奖励他！倘没有奖励的鼓舞和希望，谁肯来出力和吃苦呵！”他说。“哈，哈，哈，哈！”

一种悲伤的感情，遮暗了闺女的高华而可爱的脸：“爸爸！我真不懂你怎么就是会笑！这样的坏事和这样的下流，只使我觉得伤心。如果我看见一个人，简直公然的，而且当众做出欺骗的事情，却没有得到到处被人轻蔑的报应，我真要不知道自己会怎么样，因为我自己就要不好起来了；我想呀想呀的……”她几乎要哭出来了。

“但愿不要怪我们，”将军说，“我们和这事情是毫无关系的。不是吗？”他一面转向乞乞科夫，接着说。“哦，现在吻我一下，回你自己的房里去罢，我就要换衣服，因为立刻是午餐时候了。”

“你在我这里吃！”于是他瞥了乞乞科夫一眼，说。

“如果您大人……”

“吃罢，不要客气。这是还能请你的。谢谢上帝！我们今天有菜汤！”

乞乞科夫伸出了他的两只手，敬畏的垂了头，屋子里的一切物事，在眼睛里暂时都无影无踪了，只还能够看见自己的鞋尖。他在这种恭敬态度上，固定了一会之后，才又把脑袋抬起，却已经看不见乌理尼加。她消失了。她的地位上，站着一条大汉，是长着一部浓密的唇须和出色的络腮须子的家丁，两手分拿着银的面盆和水盂。

“你该是准许我在你面前换衣服的罢？”

“您不但可以在我面前换衣服，只要您爱在我面前做什么，都听您的便，大人！”

将军从睡衣里豁出一只手来，在斗士似的臂膊上，勒高了汗衫的袖口。他动手澡洗了，泼着水珠，哼着鼻子，好像一只鸭。肥皂水溅满了一屋子。

“哦，哦，他们要一种鼓舞和奖励，”他说，一面细心的周围擦着他的胖脖子……“抚摩他，抚摩他罢。没有奖励，他们就连偷也从此不听了。”

乞乞科夫起了少有的好心机。他突然得到一种灵感。“将军是一个快活的，好心的人物！可以试一试的！”他想，待到看见家丁拿着水盂走了出去，就大声的说道：“大人！您是对谁都很和善，恳切的！我对您有一个大大的请求。”

“怎样的请求？”

乞乞科夫谨慎的向四面看了一看。“我有一个伯父，是一个上了年纪，很是衰弱的人。他有三百个魂灵和二千……而我是他惟一的承继者。他自己早不能管理他的产业，因为他太老，太弱了，然而他也不肯交给我。他寻了一个万分奇怪的缘由：‘我不熟悉我的侄子，’他说，‘他也许是一个浪子和废料的。他得先给我看看他是可靠的人，自己先去弄三百魂灵来，那么，我就给他我的那三百了。’”

“您不要见怪！这人简直是傻的吗？”

“如果他只是一个傻子，那倒还不算顶坏的事情。这是他自己的损害。但请您替我来设身处地，大人……您想，他有一个管家女，住在他那里的，而这管家女又有孩子。这就应该留心，怕他会把全部财产都传给他们了。”

“这老傻子发了昏，如此而已。”将军说。“我怎么帮助您呢，我看是没有法子的！”他诧异的看定了乞乞科夫，一面说。

“我有一个想头，大人！如果您肯把您所有的一切死掉的魂灵，都让给我，大人，我想，立起买卖合同来，装得他们还活着一样，那么，我就可以把这合同给老头子看，他也就应该把遗产移交给我了。”

然而现在是将军很大声的笑起来了，笑得大约还没有人这样的笑过：很长久，他倒在靠椅上，把头靠在椅背上，几乎闭了气。整个屋子全都动摇。家丁在门口出现，女儿也吃惊的跑来了。

“爸爸，什么事呀？”她骇怕的嚷着，并且疑惑的看定他。然而许多工夫，将军还说不出一句话。“放心罢，没有事，好孩子。哈，哈，哈！回你的房里去就是。我们就来吃中饭了。你不要担心。哈，哈，哈！”

将军喘息了几回之后，就又用新的力量哄笑了起来；洪亮的响彻了全家，从前厅一直到最末的屋子。

乞乞科夫有一点不安了。

“可怜的阿伯！他要做大傻子了！哈，哈，哈！他要没有活的庄稼人，却得到死的了。哈，哈！”

“又来了！”乞乞科夫想。“真会笑！还会炸破的！”

“哈，哈，哈！”将军接着说，“这样的一匹驴子！怎么竟会这样的吩咐：去，自己先弄三百个魂灵来，那你就再有三百了！他真是一匹驴子！”

“对了，大人，他真是一匹驴子！”

“哪，不过你的玩笑开得也不小！请老头子吃死魂灵！哈，哈，哈！上帝在上，只要我能够从旁看见你把买卖合同交给他，我情愿给的还要多！他究竟是怎样的一个人呀？他样子怎么样？他很老了吗？”

“八十岁了！”

“他兴致还好吗？他还很行吗？他和管家女弄在一起，总该还有力气罢？”

“一点也不，大人！他很不行，好像孩子一样了！”

“这样的一个昏蛋！不是吗？他是一个昏蛋呀！”

“一点不错，大人！一个十足的昏蛋！”

“他还出去散步？他去访人？他的腿倒还好？”

“是的，不过也已经不大好走了。”

“这样的一个昏蛋！然而他倒还有兴致？怎样？他还有牙齿吗？”

“只有两个了，军门大人！”

“这样的一匹驴子！请不要生气，最敬爱的——他是你的伯父，但他却是一匹驴子呵。”

“自然是一匹驴子，大人！虽然他是我的家族，承认您说得对，我也有些为难，然而这有什么法子呢？”

好人乞乞科夫说了谎。承认这事，在他是毫没有什么为难的，因为他大约连这样的一个伯父也未必有。

“只要您大人肯赏光……”

“把死魂灵卖给你吗？为了这大计画，你可以把他们连地面和他们现在的住房都拿了去！你连全部坟地都带了去也不要紧。哈，哈，哈，哈！唉，这老头子！他要给玩一下子了！哈，哈，哈，哈！”

于是将军的哄笑，又从新响满所有的房屋了！

第三章


“如果柯式凯略夫大佐确是发疯的，那就着实不坏了。”当乞乞科夫又到了广宇之下，旷野之上的时候，他说。一切人们的住所，都远远的横在他后面：他现在只看见广大的苍穹和远处的两朵小小的云片。

“你问明白了到柯式凯略夫大佐那里去的路了吗，绥里方？”

“您要知道，保甫尔·伊凡诺维支，我对付车子的事情多得很，分不出工夫来呀。不过彼得尔希加是向车夫问了路的。”

“这样的一匹驴子！我早对你说过，你不要听凭彼得尔希加；彼得尔希加一定又喝得烂醉了！”

“这可并不是大了不得的事情。”彼得尔希加从他的坐位上稍为转过一点来，向乞乞科夫瞥了一眼，说。“我们只要跑下山，顺草地走上去，再没有别的了！”

“可是你专门喝烧酒！再没有别的了！你总是不会错的！一到你，人也可以说：这是漂亮到要吓倒欧洲的家伙哩。”说到这里，乞乞科夫就摸一把自己的下巴，并且想道：“好出身的有教养的人和这样的一个粗俗的下人之间，是有很大的区别的。”

这时车子已经驶向山下去。又只看见草地和广远的种着白杨树林的处所了。

舒适的马车在弹簧上轻轻摇动着，注意的下了微斜的山脚；于是又经过草地，旷野和水磨；车子隆隆的过了几道桥，摇摇摆摆的在远的不平的地面上跳来跳去。然而没有一座土冈，连打搅我们的旅客的清游的一个道路的高低，也非常之少。这简直是享福，并不是坐车。

葡萄树丛，细瘦的赤杨和银色的白杨，在他们身旁很快的飞过去，还用它们的枝条着实打着两个坐在马夫台上的奴子绥里方和彼得尔希加。而且屡次从彼得尔希加的头上掣去了帽子。这严厉的家丁有一回就跳下马夫台，骂着混账树，以及栽种它们的人，但他竟不想缚住自己的帽子，或者用手将它按定，因为他希望这是最末的一次，以后就不再遇到这等事了。不多久，树木里又加上了白桦，有几处还有一株枞树。树根上长着茂草，其间开着蓝色的燕子花和黄色的野生郁金香。树林尽是昏暗下去，好像黑夜笼罩了旅行者。突然在枝条和树桩之间，到处闪出雪亮的光辉，仿佛一面明镜的反射。树木疏下去了，发光的面积就大起来……他们面前横着一个湖——很大的水面，约有四维尔斯他之广。对面的岸上，现出许多小小的木屋。这是一个村子。湖水中发着大声的叫喊和呼唤，大约有二十个汉子都站在湖水里，水或者到腰带，或者到肩头，或者到颈子，是在把网拉到岸上去。这之间，他们里面竟起了意外的事情。其中的一个壮大的汉子，和一条鱼一同落在网里了，这人几乎身宽和身长相等，看去好像一个西瓜或者像是一个桶。他的景况是极窘的，就使尽力量，大叫道：“台尼斯，你这昏蛋！把这交给柯什玛！柯什玛，从台尼斯手里按过网头来呀。不要这么推，喂，大个子孚玛。来来，站到那边去，到小个子孚玛站着的地方去。畜生！我对你们说，你们还连网都要撕破了！”这西瓜分明并不担心它本身：它太胖，是淹不死的，即使想要沉没，翻个筋斗，水也总会把它送上来；真的，它的背脊上简直还可以坐两个人，也能像顽强的猪尿泡一样，浮在水面上，至多，也不过哼上几声，用鼻子吹起几个泡。然而他很害怕网会撕破，鱼会逃走，所以许多人只好拉着鱼网的索子，要把他拖到岸上来。

“这一定是老爷，柯式凯略夫大佐了。”绥里方说。

“为什么？”

“您只要看看他是怎样的一个身子就是。他比别人白，他的块头也出色，正像一位阔佬呀。”

这之间，人已经把这落网的地主拉得很近湖边了。他一觉得他的脚踏着实地，就站起来，而且在这瞬间，也看见了驶下堤来的马车和里面的坐客乞乞科夫。

“您吃过中饭了吗？”那绅士向他们叫喊着，一面拿着捉到的鱼，走向岸上来。他还全罩在鱼网里，很有些像夏天的闺秀的纤手，戴着镂空的手套，一只手搭在眼上，仿佛一个遮阳，防着日光，别一只垂在下面，近乎刚刚出浴的眉提希的威奴斯(1)的位置。

“还没有呢。”乞乞科夫回答着，除下帽子，在马车里极客气的招呼。

“哦，那么，您感谢您的造物主罢！”

“为什么呢？”乞乞科夫好奇的问，把帽子擎在头顶上。

“您马上知道了！喂，小个子孚玛，放下鱼网，向桶子里去取出鲟鱼来。柯什玛，你这昏蛋，去，帮帮他！”

两个渔夫从桶子里拉出一个怪物的头来——“瞧罢，怎样的一个大脚色！这是从河里错跑进这里来的！”那滚圆的绅士大声说。“您到舍间去就是！车夫，经过菜园，往下走！跑呀，大个子孚玛，你这呆木头，开园门去！他来带领您了，我立刻就来……”

长脚而赤脚的大个子孚玛，简直是只穿一件小衫，在马车前头跑通了全村。每家的小屋子前面，挂着各种打鱼器具，鱼网呀，鱼簖呀，以及诸如此类；全村人都是渔夫；于是孚玛开了园的栅门，马车经过一些菜畦，到了村教堂附近的一块空地上。在教堂稍远之处，望见主人的府邸的屋顶。

“这柯式凯略夫是有点古怪的！”乞乞科夫想。

“唔，我在这里！”旁边起了一种声音。乞乞科夫向周围一看。那主人穿着草绿色的南京棉布的上衣，黄色的裤子，没有领带，仿佛一个库必陀(2)似的从他旁边拉过去了。他斜坐在弹簧马车里，填满着全坐位。乞乞科夫想对他说几句话，但这胖子又即不见了。他的车子立刻又在用网打鱼的地方出现，又听到他那叫喊的声音：“大个子孚玛，小个子孚玛！柯什玛和台尼斯呀！”然而乞乞科夫到得府邸门口的时候，却大大的吃了一惊，他看见那胖子地主已经站在阶沿上，迎迓着来宾，亲爱的抱在他的臂膊里。他怎么跑的这么飞快呢——却终于是一个谜。他们依照俄国的古礼，十字形的接吻了三回：这地主是一个古董的汉子。

“我到您这里，是来传达大人的问候的。”乞乞科夫说。

“那一位大人？”

“您的亲戚，亚历山大·特米德里维支将军！”

“这亚历山大·特米德里维支是谁呀？”

“贝得理锡且夫将军。”乞乞科夫答着，有点错愕了。

“我不认识他。”那人也诧异的回答道。

乞乞科夫的惊异，只是增加了起来。

“哦，那是怎的……？我的希望，是在和大佐柯式凯略夫先生谈话的？”

“不，您还是不希望罢！您没有到他那里，却到我这里来了。我是彼得·彼得洛维支·胚土赫！胚土赫(3)！彼得·彼得洛维支！”主人回答说。

乞乞科夫惊愕得手足无措。“这不能！”他说，一面转向一样的张着嘴巴，瞪着眼睛的绥里方和彼得尔希加。一个坐在马夫台上，别一个是站在车门口。“你们是怎么弄的，你们这驴子！我对你们说过，驶到柯式凯略夫大佐那里去……这里却是彼得·彼得洛维支……”

“你们弄得很好，伙计们！到厨房去，好请你们喝杯烧酒……”彼得·彼得洛维支·胚土赫大声说。“卸下马匹，就到厨房里去罢！”

“我真是抱歉得很！闹这么一个大错！这么突然的……”乞乞科夫呐呐的说。

“一点也没有错。您先等一等，看午餐的味道怎么样，那时再说错了没有罢。请请。”胚土赫说着，一面拉了乞乞科夫的臂膊，引进宅子里去了。这里有两个穿着夏衣的少年来迎接着他们，都很细长，像一对柳条，比他们的父亲总要高到一阿耳申(4)的样子。

“是我的小儿！他们都在中学里，放暑假回来的……尼古拉沙，你留在这里陪客；你，亚历克赛沙，同我来。”说到这里，主人就不见了。

乞乞科夫和尼古拉沙留下着，寻些话来和他扳谈。尼古拉沙是好像要变懒惰青年的。他立刻对乞乞科夫说，进外省的中学，全无意义，他和他的兄弟，都准备上彼得堡去，因为在外省过活，是没有价值的。

“我懂得了，”乞乞科夫想，“马路边和咖啡店在招引你们呀……”但他就又大声的问道：“请您告诉我，您的父亲的田地，是什么情形呢？”

“我押掉了！”那父亲忽然又在大厅上出现了，就自己回答道，“押掉了许许多。”

“不行，这很不行，”乞乞科夫想，“没有抵押的田地，立刻就要一点不剩了。要赶紧才好。”……“您去抵押，是应该慢一下子的。”他装着同情的样子，说。

“阿，不的。那不相干！”胚土赫答道。“人说，这倒上算。现在大家都在去抵押，人可也不愿意自己比别人落后呀！况且我一生住在这地方；现在也想去看一看莫斯科了。我的儿子们也总在催逼我，他们实在想受些大都会的教育哩。”

“这样的一个胡涂虫！”乞乞科夫想。“他会把一切弄得精光，连自己的儿子也教成浪费者的。他有这么一宗出色的田产。看起来，到处显着好景况。农奴是好好的，主人也不愁什么缺乏。但如果他们一受大菜馆和戏院的教育，可就全都一塌胡涂了。他其实还不如静静的留在乡下的好，这吹牛皮家伙。”

“您现在在想什么，我知道的！”胚土赫说。

“什么呀？”乞乞科夫说着，有点狼狈了。

“您在想：‘这胚土赫可真是一个胡涂虫；他邀人来吃中饭，却教人尽等。’就来，马上来了，最敬爱的。您看着罢，一个剪发的姑娘还不及赶忙挽好髻子，饭菜就摆在桌上了。”

“阿呀！柏拉图·密哈洛维支骑了马来哩！”站在窗前，望着外面的亚历克赛沙说。

“他骑着他那枣骝马呢！”尼古拉沙接着道，一面向窗口弯着腰。

“那里？那里？”胚土赫叫着，也跑到窗口去了。

“那是谁呀，柏拉图·密哈洛维支？”乞乞科夫问亚历克赛沙道。

“我们的邻居，柏拉图·密哈洛维支·柏拉图诺夫，一个非凡的人，一个出众的人。”主人自己回答说。

在这瞬息中，柏拉图诺夫走进屋子里来了。他是一个亚麻色卷发的漂亮而瘦长的男子。一匹狗子的精怪，名叫雅尔伯，响着项圈，跟在他后面。

“您已经吃过饭了吗？”

“是的，多谢！”

“您是来和我开玩笑的吗？如果您已经吃过，教我怎么办才好呢？”

客人微笑着说道：“我可以不使您为难，我其实什么也没有吃过，我不想吃。”

“您就是瞧瞧罢，我们今天捉到了怎样的东西呵！我们网得了出色的鲟鱼！还有出色的鲫鱼和鲤鱼呢！”

“听您说话，就令人要生起气来的。您为什么总是这么高兴的？”

“为什么我该阴郁呢？我请教您！”那主人说。

“怎么？为什么吗？——因为世界上是悲哀和无聊呀。”

“这只因为您没有吃足。您饱饱的吃一顿试试看。这阴郁和这忧愁，也是一种摩登的发明。先前是谁也不阴郁的。”

“您的圣谕，尽够了！这么一说，好像您就没有忧愁过似的。”

“从来没有！我也毫没有分给忧愁的工夫。早上——是睡着，刚刚睁开眼睛，厨子已经站在面前了，就得安排中餐的菜单，于是喝茶，吩咐管事人，出去捉鱼，一下子，就到了中餐的时候。中餐之后，不过睡了一下，厨子可又来了。得准备晚餐，晚餐之后又来了厨子，又得想明天的中餐，教人那里有忧愁的工夫呢？”

当两人交谈之间，乞乞科夫就观察那来客，他那非凡的美丽，他那苗条的，合适的体态，他那尚未耗损的青春之力的清新，以及他那绝无小疮损了颜色的处女一般的纯净，都使他惊异了。激情或苦痛，连近似懊恼或不安那样的东西，也从没有碰着过他那年青的纯洁的脸，或在平静的表面上，掘出一条皱纹来，但自然也不能使它活泼。他的脸虽然由于嘲弄的微笑，有时见得快活，然而总有些懵懂的样子。

“如果您容许我说几句话，那么，以您们的风采，却还要悲哀，我可实在不解了！”乞乞科夫说。“人自然也愁生计，也有仇人……也有谁在想陷害或者竟至于图谋性命……”

“您以为我，”那漂亮的客人打断他道，“您以为我因为要有变化，竟至于在希望什么小小的刺戟吗？如果有谁要恼我一下，或者有这一类事情的话——然而这事谁也没有做。生活只是无聊——如此而巳。”

“那么，您该是地面不够，或者也许是农奴太少了。”

“完全不是。我的兄弟和我一共有一万顷的田地，一千以上的魂灵。”

“奇怪。那我就不能懂了。但也许您苦于收成不好和时疫？也许您损失了许多农奴罢？”

“倒相反，什么都非常之好，我的兄弟是一个出众的田地经营家！”

“但是您却在悲哀和不舒服！这我不懂。”乞乞科夫说，耸一耸肩。

“您瞧着罢，我们要立刻来赶走这忧郁病了。”主人说，“亚历克赛沙，快跑到厨房里去，对厨子说，他得给我们送鱼肉馒头来了。懒虫亚美梁在那里？一定又是大张着嘴巴了。还有那贼骨头，那安多式加呢？他们为什么不搬冷盘来的？”

但这时候，房门开开了。走进懒虫亚美梁和贼骨头安多式加来，挟着桌布，盖好了食桌，摆上一个盘，其中是各样颜色的六瓶酒。绕着这些，立刻攒聚了盛着种种可口的食品的盘子一大圈。家丁们敏捷的在奔走，总在搬进些有盖的盘子来，人听到那里面牛酪吱吱发响。懒虫亚美梁和贼骨头安多式加都把自己的事情做得很出色。他们的有着这样的绰号，是不过为了鼓励而设的。主人决没有骂人的嗜好，他还要和善得多；然而一个俄国人，是不能不说一句恶话的。他要这东西，正如他那帮助消化的一小杯烧酒。有什么办法呢！这是他的天性，来消遣那没有刺戟性的食料的！

接着冷盘，才是正式的中餐。这时候，我们的和善的主人，可就化为真正的专制君主了。他一看见客人里面的谁，盘子里只剩着一块，便立刻给他放上第二块，一面申说道：“世界上是什么都成对的，人类，飞禽和走兽！”谁的盘子里有两块，他就去添上第三块，并且注意道：“这不是好数目：二！所有的好物事都是三。”客人刚把三块吃完，他又已经叫起来了：“您曾见过一辆三轮的车子，或者一间三角的小屋子吗？”对于四或五这些数目，他也都准备着一句成语。乞乞科夫确已吃了十二块，自己想：“哼，现在是主人一定不会再劝了！”然而他是错误的：主人一声不响，就把一大块烤牛排和腰子都放在他的盘子上。而且是多么大的牛排呵！

“这是两个月之间，单用牛奶喂养的。”主人说。“我抚养它，就像亲生儿子一样。”

“我吃不下了！”乞乞科夫呻吟道。

“您先尝一尝，然后再说：我吃不下了！”

“这可实在不成了！我胃里已经没有地方了。”

“教堂里也已经没有地方，但警察局长跑来了，瞧罢，总还能找出一块小地方。那是拥挤到连一个苹果也落不到地的时候呢。您尝一尝：这一小块——这也是一位警察局长呀。”

乞乞科夫尝起来，而且的确——这一块和警察局长十分相像，真的找到了地方，然而他的胃也好像填得满满了。

“这样的人，是不能到彼得堡或莫斯科去的，他那阔绰，三年里面就会弄到一文不剩。”然而他还没有知道：现在已经很不同：即使并不这么请客，在那地方也能把他的财产在三年里——什么话，在三年里！——在三个月里化得精光的。

这之间，主人还不住的斟酒；客人不喝，就得由亚历克赛沙和尼古拉沙来喝干，一杯一杯挨次灌下喉咙去；这就可以推想，他们将来到得首都，特别用功的是人类知识的那一方面了。客人们几乎都弄得昏头昏脑！他们只好努力蹩出凉台去，立刻倒在安乐椅子上。主人是好容易这才找到自己的坐位，但一坐倒也就睡去了。他那茁壮的自己立刻化为大风箱，从张开的嘴巴和鼻孔里发出一种我们现代的音乐家很少演奏的声音来：混杂着打鼓和吹笛，还有短促的断续声，非常像狗叫。

“您听到他怎样的吹吗？”柏拉图诺夫说。

乞乞科夫只得笑了起来。

“自然；如果吃了这样的中餐，人还那里来的无聊呢？睡觉压倒他了——不是吗？”

“是的。请您宽恕，但我可真的不懂，人怎么会不快活，消遣的方法是多得很的。”

“那是些什么呢？”

“一个年青人，什么不可以弄呢？跳舞，音乐……玩一种什么乐器……或者……譬如说，他为什么不结婚的？”

“但和谁呀？”

“好像四近竟没有漂亮的，有钱的闺女似的！”

“没有呵！”

“那么，到别地方去看去。旅行一下……”乞乞科夫突然起了出色的想头。“您是有对付忧郁和无聊的好法子的！”他说，一面看一看柏拉图诺夫的眼睛。

“什么法子呢？”

“旅行。”

“到那里去旅行呢？”

“如果您有工夫，那么，就请您同我一道走罢。”乞乞科夫说，并且观察着柏拉图诺夫，自己想道：“这真上算。他可以负担一半用度，马车修缮费也可以归他独自支付了。”

“您要到那里去呀？”

“目下我并非怎么为了自己的事情，倒是别人的关系。贝德理锡且夫将军，是我的一个好朋友，我也可以说，是我的恩人，他托我去探问几个他的亲戚……探亲戚自然是很重要的，但我的旅行，可也为了所谓我本身的快乐：见见世面，在人海的大旋涡中混一下——无论怎么说，这是所谓活书本，而且也是一种学问呀。”说到这里，他又想道：“真的，这很好。他简直可以负担全部的用度，我们还连马匹也可以用他的，把我的放在他这里，好好的养一养哩。”

“为什么我不去旅行一下呢？”这时柏拉图诺夫想。“就是不出去，我在家里也没有事，管理经济的是我的兄弟，也不是我；我出了门，这些都毫无影响的。为什么我不同去走走呢？”——“您能到我的兄弟那里去做两天客吗？”他大声说。“要不然，我的兄弟是不放我走的。”

“这可是非常之愿意。就是三天也不要紧。”

“那么，约定了。我们走罢！”柏拉图诺夫活泼的说。

乞乞科夫握手为信。“很好！我们走罢！”

“那里去？那里去？”主人刚刚从睡梦里醒来，吃惊的看定了他们，叫喊道。——“不成的呵，亲爱的先生们，我已经吩咐把车轮子卸掉了，还赶走了您的马，柏拉图·密哈洛维支，离这里有五维尔斯他。不成的，今天你们总得在我这里过夜，明天我们中餐吃的早一点，那么，随便你们走就是了。”

这有什么办法呢？人只好决定留下。但他们却因此无忧无虑的过了可惊的春晚。主人给去游湖了。十二个桨手用二十四枝桨，唱着快活的歌，送他们到了镜似的湖面上。从湖里又到了河上，前面一望无涯，两面都界着平坦的河岸。他们逐渐临近那横截河流的大网和张着小网的地方去。没有一个微波来皱蹙那光滑的水面；乡村的美景，寂无声息的在他们面前连翩而过，还有昏暗的丛树和小林，则以树木的各式各样的排列和攒聚，来耸动他们的视线。船夫们一律抓住桨，仿佛出于一手似的二十四枝就同时举在空中——恰如一匹轻禽一样，小船就在不动的水面上滑过去了。一个年青人，是强壮的阔肩膀的家伙，舵前的第三个，用出于夜莺的喉里一般的他那澄净的声音，开始唱起歌来，于是第五个接唱着，第六个摇曳着，响亮而抑扬的弥满了歌曲：无边无际，恰如俄罗斯本身。如果合唱队没了劲，胚土赫也常常自己来出马和支持，用一种声音，很像公鸡叫。真的，在这一晚，连乞乞科夫也活泼的觉得自己是俄国人了。只有柏拉图诺夫却想：“在这忧郁的歌里面，有什么好东西呢？这不过使已在悲哀的人，更加悲哀罢了。”

当大家返棹时，黄昏已经开始。天色昏暗起来；现在是只在不再反映天空的水里打桨。到得岸上，早已完全昏黑了。到处点着火把，渔夫们用了还会动弹的活鲈鱼，在三脚架上熬鱼汤。人们都回到家里去了。家畜和家禽久已归舍，它们搅起的尘头，也已经平静，牧人们站在门口，等着牛奶瓶和分来的鱼汤。人声的轻微的嘈杂，在夜中发响，还从一个邻村传来了远远的犬吠声。月亮刚刚上升，阴暗处这才笼罩了它的光辉；一切东西，立刻全都朗然晃耀了。多么出色的景象呵！然而能够欣赏的人，却一个也没有。尼古拉沙和亚历克赛沙也没有跳上两匹剽悍的骏马，为了打赌，在夜里发狂的飞跑，却只默默的想着莫斯科，想着咖啡店和戏院，这是一个土官候补生从首都前来访问，滔滔的讲给他们听了的；他们的父亲是在想他怎样来好好的塞饱他的客人，柏拉图诺夫则在打呵欠。乞乞科夫却还算最活泼：“唔，真的，我也应该给自己买一宗田产的！”于是他已经看见，旁边一位结实的娘儿们，周围一大群小乞乞科夫们的幻影了。

晚餐也还是吃的很多。当乞乞科夫跨进给他睡觉的屋子，躺在床上，摸着自己的肚子时，就说：“简直成了一面鼓！连警察局长也进不去了！”而且环境也很不寻常，卧室的隔壁就是主人的屋子。墙壁又薄得很，因此什么谈话都听得到。主人正在吩咐厨子，安排明天一早开出来的中餐的丰盛之至的饭菜。而且那是多么注意周到呵！连一个死尸也会馋起来的！

“那么，你给我烤起四方的鱼肉包子来。”他说，一面高声的啧啧的响着嘴巴，使劲的吸一口气。“一个角上，你给我包上鲟鱼的脸肉和软骨，别的地方就用荞麦粥呀，蘑菇呀，葱呀，甜的鱼白呀，脑子呀以及什么这一类东西，你是知道的……一面你要烤得透，烤得它发黄，别一面可用不着这么烤透。最要紧的是得留心馅子——要拌得极匀，你知道，万不可弄得散散的，却应该放到嘴里就化，像雪一样；连吃的人自己也不大觉得。”说到这里，胚土赫又啧啧的响了几下嘴唇，啧的响了一声舌头。

“见鬼！这教人怎么睡得着。”乞乞科夫想着，拉上盖被来蒙了头，要不再听到。然而这并不能救助他，在盖被下面，他还是听到胚土赫的说话。

“鲟鱼旁边，你得围上红萝卜的星花，白鱼和香菌；也还要加些萝卜呀，胡萝卜呀，豆子呀，以及各式各样，这你是知道的；总而言之，添配的作料要多，你听见了没有？你还得在猪肚里灌上冰，使它胀起一点！”

胚土赫还吩咐了许多另外的美味的食品。人只听得他总在说：“给我烤一下，要烤得透，给我蒸一蒸罢！”待到他终于讲到火鸡的时候，乞乞科夫睡着了。

第二天，客人们吃得非常之饱，柏拉图诺夫至于再不能骑马了。胚土赫的马夫把他的骏马送到家里去。于是大家上了车。那匹大头狗就懒懒的跟在车后面：它也吃得太饱了。

“唉唉，这太过了！”当大家离开府邸时，乞乞科夫说。

“那人可总是快活！这真恼人。”

“倘使我有你的七万卢布的进款，忧郁是进不了门的！”乞乞科夫想。“那个包办酒捐的木拉梭夫——就有一千万。说说容易，一千万——但我以为是一个数儿呵！”

“如果我们在中途停一下，您没有什么异议吗？我还想上我的姊姊和姊夫那里去辞一辞行呢。”

“非常之愿意！”乞乞科夫说。

“他是一个极出色的地主。在这四近是首屈一指的。八年以前，收入不到二万卢布的田产，他现在弄到岁收二十万卢布了！”

“哦，这一定是一位极有意思，极可尊敬的人了！我是很愿意向这样的人领教的。我拜托您——您以为怎么样……他的贵姓呢？”

“康士坦夏格罗。”

“那么，他的本名和父称呢，如果我可以问的话？”

“康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支。”

“康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支·康士坦夏格罗。我实在极愿意认识认识他。从这样的一个人，可学的地方多得很。”

柏拉图诺夫担当了重大的职务，是监督绥里方，因为他不大能够在马夫台上坐定了，所以要监督。彼得尔希加是已经两回倒栽葱跌下马车来，因此也要用一条绳，在马夫台上缚住。

“这猪猡！”乞乞科夫所能说的，只有这一句。

“您看！从这里起，是他的田地了！”柏拉图诺夫说。“样子就全两样！”

实在的：他们前面横着一片满生嫩林的幼树保护地——每棵小树，都很苗条，而且直的像一枝箭，这后面又看见第二片也还是幼稚的小树林，再后面才耸着一座老林，满是出色的枞树，越后就越高大。于是又来了一片幼树保护地，一条新的，之后是一条老的树林子。他们经过了三回树林，好像通过城门一样：“这全个林子，仅仅种了八年到十年，倘是别人，即使等到二十年，恐怕也未必长的这么高大。”

“但是他怎样办的呢？”

“您问他自己罢。那是一个非凡的土壤学家——什么也不会白费。他不但很明白土壤，也知道什么树木，什么植物，在什么的近邻，就长得最好，以及什么树木，应该靠近谷物来种之类。在他那里，一切东西都同时有三四种作用。树林是不但为了木料的，尤其是因为这一带的田野，要有许多湿气和许多阴凉，枯叶呢，他还用作土壤的肥料……即使四近到处是旱灾，他这里却什么都很像样；所有的邻居都叹收成坏，只有他却用不着诉苦。可惜我对于这事情知道得很少，讲不出来……谁明白他那些花样和玩艺呢！在那里，人是大抵叫他魔术家的。他有什么会没有呀！……但是呵！虽然如此，也无聊的很！”

“这实在该是一个可惊的人物了！”乞乞科夫想。“可惜这少年人竟这么肤浅，对人讲不出什么来。”

村庄也到底出现了。布在三个高地上的许许多农家，远看竟好像一个市镇。每个冈上，都有教堂结顶，到处看见站着谷物和干草的大堆。“唔！”乞乞科夫想，“人立刻知道，这里是住着一位王侯似的地主的！”农夫小屋都造得很坚牢和耐久；处处停着一辆货车——车子也都强固，簇新。凡所遇见的农奴，个个是聪明伶俐的脸相；牛羊也是最好的种子，连农奴的猪，看去也好像贵族似的。人们所得的印象，是住在这里的农夫，恰如诗歌里说的那样，在用铲子把银子搬到家里去。这地方没有英国式的公园，以及草地，以及别样穷工尽巧的布置，倒不过照着旧习惯，是一大排谷仓和工厂，一直接到府邸，给主人可以管理他前前后后的事情；府邸的高的屋顶上有一座灯塔一类的东西；这并非建筑上的装饰；也不是为主人和他的客人而设，给他们可以在这里赏鉴美丽的风景，倒是由此监视那些在远处的工人的。旅客们到了门口，由机灵的家丁们来招待，全不像永远烂醉的彼得尔希加；他们也不穿常礼服，却是平常的手织的蓝布衫，像哥萨克所常用的那样。

主妇也跑下阶沿来。她有血乳交融似的鲜活的脸色，美如上帝的晴天，她和柏拉图诺夫就像两个蛋，所不同的只是她没有他那么衰弱和昏沉，却总是快活，爱说话。

“日安，兄弟！你来了，这使我很高兴。可惜的是康士坦丁没在家，但他也就回来的。”

“他那里去了呢？”

“他和几个商人在村子里有点事情。”她说着，一面把客人引进屋里去。

乞乞科夫好奇的环顾了这岁收二十万卢布的奇特人物的住家，他以为可以由这里窥见主人的性格和特长，恰如从曾经住过，剩着痕迹的空壳，来推见牡蛎或蜗牛一样。然而住家却什么钥匙也不给。屋子全都质朴，简单，而且近乎空空洞洞；既没有壁画，也没有铜像，花卉，放着贵重磁器的架子，简直连书籍也没有。总而言之，这一切，就说明了住在这里的人，他那生活的最大部份，是不在四面墙壁的房子里面的，却过在外面的田野上，而且他的计画，也不是安闲的靠着软椅，对着炉火，在这里耽乐他的思想的，却在正在努力做事的处所，而且也就在那里实行。在屋子里，乞乞科夫只能发见一位贤妇的治家精神的痕迹：桌子和椅子上，放着菩提树板，板上撒着一种花瓣，分明是在阴干。

“这是什么废物呀，那散在这里的，姊姊？”柏拉图诺夫说。

“这可并不是废物呵！”主妇回答道。“这是医热病的好药料。去年我们把所有我们的农夫都用这东西治好了。我们用这来做酒，那边的一些是要浸的。你总是笑我们的果酱和腌菜，但你一吃，却自己称赞起来了。”

柏拉图诺夫走近钢琴去，看看翻开着的乐谱。

“天哪，这古董！”他说。“你毫不难为情吗，姊姊？”

“你不要怪我罢，兄弟，我已经没有潜心音乐的工夫了。我有一个八岁的女儿，我得教导她。难道为了要有闲工夫来弄音乐，就把她交给一个外国的家庭教师吗？——这是不行的，对不起，我可不这么办！”

“你也变了无聊了，姊姊！”那兄弟说着，走到窗口去：“阿呀，他已经在这里，他来了，他恰恰回来了！”柏拉图诺夫叫喊道。

乞乞科夫也跑到窗口去。一个大约四十岁的男子，浅黑的活泼的脸，身穿驼毛的短衫，正在走向家里来。对于衣服，他是不注意的。他戴一顶没边的帽子。旁边一同走着两个身分低微的男人，极恭敬的光着头，交谈得很起劲；一个只是平常的农奴，别一个是走江湖的乡下掮客，穿着垂膝的长衫的狡猾的家伙。三个人都在门口站住了，但在屋子里，可以分明的听到他们的谈话。

“你们所做得到的，最好是这样：把你们从自己的主人那里赎出来。这款子我不妨借给你们；你们将来可以用做工来还清的！”

“不不，康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支，我们为什么要赎出自己来呢？还是请您完全买了我们的好。在您这里，我们能够学好。像您似的好人，全世界上是不会再有的。现在谁都过着困苦的日子，没有法子办。酒店主人发明了这样的烧酒，喝一点到肚子里，就像喝完了一大桶水似的：不知不觉，把最末的一文钱也化光了。诱惑也很大。我相信，恶在支配着世界哩，实在的！教农夫们发昏的事情，他们什么不干呢！烟草和所有这些坏花样。怎么办才好呢，康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支？人总不过是一个人——是很容易受引诱的。”

“听罢：要商量的就是这件事。即使你们到我这里来，你们也还是并不自由的呵，自然，你们能得到一切需要的东西：一头牛和一匹马；不过我所要求于我的农夫的，却也和别的地主不一样。在我这里，首先是要做工，这是第一；为我，还是为自己呢，这都毫无差别，只是不能偷懒。我自己也公牛似的做，和我的农夫一样多，因为据我的经验：凡一个人只想轻浮，就因为不做事的缘故。总之，关于这事情，你们去想一想，并且好好的商量一下罢，如果你们统统要来的话。”

“我们商量过好多回了，康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支。就是老人们也已经说过：‘您这里的农夫都有钱，这不是偶然的；您这里的牧师也很会体帖人，有好心肠。我们的却满不管，现在是，我们连一个能给人好好的安葬的人也没有了。’”

“你还是再向教区去谈一谈的好。”

“遵您的命。”

“不是吗，康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支，您已经这么客气了，把价钱让一点点罢。”在别一边和康士坦夏格罗排着走来的，穿蓝长衫的走江湖的乡下掮客说。

“我早已告诉你，我是不让价的。我可不像别个的地主，他们那里，你是总在他们应该还你款子的时候，立刻露脸的。我很明白你们；你们有一本簿子，记着欠账的人们。这简单得很，这样的一个人，是在毫无办法的境地上，那他自然把一切都用半价卖给你们了，我这里却不一样。我要你的钱做什么呢？我可以把货色静静的躺三年；我不必到抵押银行里去付利息！”

“您说的真对，康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支。我说这话，不过为了将来也要和您有往来，并不是出于贪得和利己。请，这里是三千卢布的定钱！”一说这话，商人就从胸口的袋子里，拉出一束污旧的钞票来。康士坦夏格罗极平淡的接到手，也不点数，就塞在衣袋里了。

“哼，”乞乞科夫想，“就好像是他的手帕似的！”但这时康士坦夏格罗在客厅的门口出现了。他那晒黑的脸孔，他那处处见得已经发白的蓬松的黑头发，他那眼睛的活泼的表情，以及显得是出于南方的有些激情的样子，都给了乞乞科夫很深的印象。他不是纯粹的俄罗斯人。但他的祖先是出于那里的呢，他却连自己也不十分明白。他并不留心自己的家谱；这和他不相干，而且他以为对于经营家业，这是没有什么用处的。他自认为一个俄国人，除俄国话之外，也不懂别种的言语。

柏拉图诺夫绍介了乞乞科夫。他们俩接了吻。

“你知道，康士坦丁，我已经决定，要旅行一下，到几个外省去看看了。我要治一治我的无聊，”柏拉图诺夫说，“保甫尔·伊凡诺维支已经对我说过，和他一同走。”

“这好极了！”康士坦夏格罗说。“但是您豫备到那些地方去呢？”他亲热的转向乞乞科夫，接下去道。

“我得申明一下，”乞乞科夫说，一面谦恭的侧着头，并用手擦着安乐椅子的靠手，“我得申明一下，我旅行并非为了自己的事情，倒是别人的关系：我的一个好朋友，我也可以说，是我的恩人，贝德理锡且夫将军，嘱托了我，去探问几个他的亲戚。探亲自然是很重要的，但另一方面，我的旅行，却也为了所谓我本身的快乐，即使把旅行有益于痔疮，不算作一件事：而见见世面，在人海的大旋涡中混一下——这是所谓活书本，而且也是一种学问呵。”

“非常之对！到世界上去游历游历，是很好的。”

“高明的见解！的确得很，实在是好的。人可以看见平常不会看见的各式各样的东西，还遇见平常恐怕不会碰到的人物。许多交谈，是价值等于黄金的，例子就在眼前，在我是一个很侥幸的机会……我拜托您，最可敬的康士坦丁·菲陀洛维支。请您帮助我，请您教导我，请您镇抚我的饥渴，并且指示我以进向真理的道路。我非常渴望您的话，恰如对于上天的曼那(5)。”

“哦，那是什么呢？……我能教您什么呢？”康士坦夏格罗惶惑的说。“连我自己也不过化了几文学费的！”

“智慧呀，尊敬的人，请您指教我智慧和方法，怎样操纵农业经济的重任，怎样赚取确实的利益，怎样获得财富和幸福，而且要并非空想上，却是实际上的幸福，因为这是每个市民的义务，也借此博得同人的尊敬的呵。”

“您可知道？”康士坦夏格罗说，并且深思的向他凝视着。“您在我这里停一天罢。我就给您看所有的设备，并且告诉您一切，您就知道，这是用不着什么大智慧的。”

“当然，您停下罢！”主妇插嘴说；于是转向她的兄弟，接下去道：“停下罢，兄弟，你是不忙什么的。”

“我都随便。但保甫尔·伊凡诺维支没有什么不方便吗？”

“一点儿也没有，非常之愿意……只不过还有一件事情：一位贝德理锡且夫将军的亲戚，柯式凯略夫大佐……”

“这人可是发疯的哩！”

“自然是发疯的！我并不要去探问他，然而贝德理锡且夫将军，您知道，我的一个好朋友，也是所谓我的恩人……”

“您可知道？那么，您马上就去罢，”康士坦夏格罗说，“您马上到他那里去。他家离这里不到十维尔斯他的。我的车正驾着——您坐了去就是。到喝茶时候，您就可以已经回来了。”

“很好的想头！”乞乞科夫抓起了帽子，大声说。

PART I





CHAPTER I


To the door of an inn in the provincial town of N. there drew up a smart britchka—a light spring-carriage of the sort affected by bachelors, retired lieutenant-colonels, staff-captains, land-owners possessed of about a hundred souls, and, in short, all persons who rank as gentlemen of the intermediate category. In the britchka was seated such a gentleman—a man who, though not handsome, was not ill-favoured, not over-fat, and not over-thin. Also, though not over-elderly, he was not over-young. His arrival produced no stir in the town, and was accompanied by no particular incident, beyond that a couple of peasants who happened to be standing at the door of a dramshop exchanged a few comments with reference to the equipage rather than to the individual who was seated in it. “Look at that carriage,” one of them said to the other. “Think you it will be going as far as Moscow?” “I think it will,” replied his companion. “But not as far as Kazan, eh?” “No, not as far as Kazan.” With that the conversation ended. Presently, as the britchka was approaching the inn, it was met by a young man in a pair of very short, very tight breeches of white dimity, a quasi-fashionable frockcoat, and a dickey fastened with a pistol-shaped bronze tie-pin. The young man turned his head as he passed the britchka and eyed it attentively; after which he clapped his hand to his cap (which was in danger of being removed by the wind) and resumed his way.

On the vehicle reaching the inn door, its occupant found standing there to welcome him the polevoi, or waiter, of the establishment—an individual of such nimble and brisk movement that even to distinguish the character of his face was impossible. Running out with a napkin in one hand and his lanky form clad in a tailcoat, reaching almost to the nape of his neck, he tossed back his locks, and escorted the gentleman upstairs, along a wooden gallery, and so to the bedchamber which God had prepared for the gentleman's reception. The said bedchamber was of quite ordinary appearance, since the inn belonged to the species to be found in all provincial towns—the species wherein, for two roubles a day, travellers may obtain a room swarming with black-beetles, and communicating by a doorway with the apartment adjoining. True, the doorway may be blocked up with a wardrobe; yet behind it, in all probability, there will be standing a silent, motionless neighbour whose ears are burning to learn every possible detail concerning the latest arrival. The inn's exterior corresponded with its interior. Long, and consisting only of two storeys, the building had its lower half destitute of stucco; with the result that the dark-red bricks, originally more or less dingy, had grown yet dingier under the influence of atmospheric changes. As for the upper half of the building, it was, of course, painted the usual tint of unfading yellow. Within, on the ground floor, there stood a number of benches heaped with horse-collars, rope, and sheepskins; while the window-seat accommodated a sbitentshik, cheek by jowl with a samovar —the latter so closely resembling the former in appearance that, but for the fact of the samovar possessing a pitch-black lip, the samovar and the sbitentshik might have been two of a pair.

During the traveller's inspection of his room his luggage was brought into the apartment. First came a portmanteau of white leather whose raggedness indicated that the receptacle had made several previous journeys. The bearers of the same were the gentleman's coachman, Selifan (a little man in a large overcoat), and the gentleman's valet, Petrushka—the latter a fellow of about thirty, clad in a worn, over-ample jacket which formerly had graced his master's shoulders, and possessed of a nose and a pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to his face rather a sullen expression. Behind the portmanteau came a small dispatch-box of redwood, lined with birch bark, a boot-case, and (wrapped in blue paper) a roast fowl; all of which having been deposited, the coachman departed to look after his horses, and the valet to establish himself in the little dark anteroom or kennel where already he had stored a cloak, a bagful of livery, and his own peculiar smell. Pressing the narrow bedstead back against the wall, he covered it with the tiny remnant of mattress—a remnant as thin and flat (perhaps also as greasy) as a pancake— which he had managed to beg of the landlord of the establishment.

While the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman had repaired to the common parlour. The appearance of common parlours of the kind is known to every one who travels. Always they have varnished walls which, grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke, are, in their lower, grown shiny with the friction of customers' backs—more especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen as, on market-days, make it their regular practice to resort to the local hostelry for a glass of tea. Also, parlours of this kind invariably contain smutty ceilings, an equally smutty chandelier, a number of pendent shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter scurries across the shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses (the glasses looking like a flock of birds roosting by the seashore), and a selection of oil paintings. In short, there are certain objects which one sees in every inn. In the present case the only outstanding feature of the room was the fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was portrayed as possessing breasts of a size such as the reader can never in his life have beheld. A similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted in the historical pictures (of unknown origin, period, and creation) which reach us—sometimes through the instrumentality of Russian magnates who profess to be connoisseurs of art— from Italy; owing to the said magnates having made such purchases solely on the advice of the couriers who have escorted them. To resume, however—our traveller removed his cap, and divested his neck of a parti-coloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for her husband with her own hands, while accompanying the gift with interminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be folded. True, bachelors also wear similar gauds, but, in their case, God alone knows who may have manufactured the articles! For my part, I cannot endure them. Having unfolded the scarf, the gentleman ordered dinner, and whilst the various dishes were being got ready—cabbage soup, a pie several weeks old, a dish of marrow and peas, a dish of sausages and cabbage, a roast fowl, some salted cucumber, and the sweet tart which stands perpetually ready for use in such establishments; whilst, I say, these things were either being warmed up or brought in cold, the gentleman induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of tittle-tattle concerning the late landlord of the hostelry, the amount of income which the hostelry produced, and the character of its present proprietor. To the last-mentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer invariably given in such cases— namely, “My master is a terribly hard man, sir.” Curious that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even take a meal at an inn without chattering to the attendant and making free with him! Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman asked were aimless ones, for he inquired who was Governor of the town, who President of the Local Council, and who Public Prosecutor. In short, he omitted no single official of note, while asking also (though with an air of detachment) the most exact particulars concerning the landowners of the neighbourhood. Which of them, he inquired, possessed serfs, and how many of them? How far from the town did those landowners reside? What was the character of each landowner, and was he in the habit of paying frequent visits to the town? The gentleman also made searching inquiries concerning the hygienic condition of the countryside. Was there, he asked, much sickness about—whether sporadic fever, fatal forms of ague, smallpox, or what not? Yet, though his solicitude concerning these matters showed more than ordinary curiosity, his bearing retained its gravity unimpaired, and from time to time he blew his nose with portentous fervour. Indeed, the manner in which he accomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme, for, though that member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in intensity, he could yet, with his accompanying air of guileless dignity, evoke the waiter's undivided respect—so much so that, whenever the sounds of the nose reached that menial's ears, he would shake back his locks, straighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude, and inquire afresh, with head slightly inclined, whether the gentleman happened to require anything further. After dinner the guest consumed a cup of coffee, and then, seating himself upon the sofa, with, behind him, one of those wool-covered cushions which, in Russian taverns, resemble nothing so much as a cobblestone or a brick, fell to snoring; whereafter, returning with a start to consciousness, he ordered himself to be conducted to his room, flung himself at full length upon the bed, and once more slept soundly for a couple of hours. Aroused, eventually, by the waiter, he, at the latter's request, inscribed a fragment of paper with his name, his surname, and his rank (for communication, in accordance with the law, to the police): and on that paper the waiter, leaning forward from the corridor, read, syllable by syllable: “Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, Collegiate Councillor—Landowner—Travelling on Private Affairs.” The waiter had just time to accomplish this feat before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town. Apparently the place succeeded in satisfying him, and, to tell the truth, it was at least up to the usual standard of our provincial capitals. Where the staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his eye he found himself confronted with the more modest grey of wooden ones; which, consisting, for the most part, of one or two storeys (added to the range of attics which provincial architects love so well), looked almost lost amid the expanses of street and intervening medleys of broken or half-finished partition-walls. At other points evidence of more life and movement was to be seen, and here the houses stood crowded together and displayed dilapidated, rain-blurred signboards whereon boots of cakes or pairs of blue breeches inscribed “Arshavski, Tailor,” and so forth, were depicted. Over a shop containing hats and caps was written “Vassili Thedorov, Foreigner”; while, at another spot, a signboard portrayed a billiard table and two players—the latter clad in frockcoats of the kind usually affected by actors whose part it is to enter the stage during the closing act of a piece, even though, with arms sharply crooked and legs slightly bent, the said billiard players were taking the most careful aim, but succeeding only in making abortive strokes in the air. Each emporium of the sort had written over it: “This is the best establishment of its kind in the town.” Also, al fresco in the streets there stood tables heaped with nuts, soap, and gingerbread (the latter but little distinguishable from the soap), and at an eating-house there was displayed the sign of a plump fish transfixed with a gaff. But the sign most frequently to be discerned was the insignia of the State, the double-headed eagle (now replaced, in this connection, with the laconic inscription “Dramshop”). As for the paving of the town, it was uniformly bad. The gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens, which contained only a few sorry trees that were poorly selected, requiring to be propped with oil-painted, triangular green supports, and able to boast of a height no greater than that of an ordinary walking-stick. Yet recently the local paper had said (apropos of a gala) that, “Thanks to the efforts of our Civil Governor, the town has become enriched with a pleasaunce full of umbrageous, spaciously-branching trees. Even on the most sultry day they afford agreeable shade, and indeed gratifying was it to see the hearts of our citizens panting with an impulse of gratitude as their eyes shed tears in recognition of all that their Governor has done for them!” Next, after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of finding the local council, the local law-courts, and the local Governor, should he (Chichikov) have need of them, the gentleman went on to inspect the river which ran through the town. En route he tore off a notice affixed to a post, in order that he might the more conveniently read it after his return to the inn. Also, he bestowed upon a lady of pleasant exterior who, escorted by a footman laden with a bundle, happened to be passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare. Lastly, he threw around him a comprehensive glance (as though to fix in his mind the general topography of the place) and betook himself home. There, gently aided by the waiter, he ascended the stairs to his bedroom, drank a glass of tea, and, seating himself at the table, called for a candle; which having been brought him, he produced from his pocket the notice, held it close to the flame, and conned its tenour— slightly contracting his right eye as he did so. Yet there was little in the notice to call for remark. All that it said was that shortly one of Kotzebue's plays would be given, and that one of the parts in the play was to be taken by a certain Monsieur Poplevin, and another by a certain Mademoiselle Ziablova, while the remaining parts were to be filled by a number of less important personages. Nevertheless the gentleman perused the notice with careful attention, and even jotted down the prices to be asked for seats for the performance. Also, he remarked that the bill had been printed in the press of the Provincial Government. Next, he turned over the paper, in order to see if anything further was to be read on the reverse side; but, finding nothing there, he refolded the document, placed it in the box which served him as a receptacle for odds and ends, and brought the day to a close with a portion of cold veal, a bottle of pickles, and a sound sleep.

The following day he devoted to paying calls upon the various municipal officials—a first, and a very respectful, visit being paid to the Governor. This personage turned out to resemble Chichikov himself in that he was neither fat nor thin. Also, he wore the riband of the order of Saint Anna about his neck, and was reported to have been recommended also for the star. For the rest, he was large and good-natured, and had a habit of amusing himself with occasional spells of knitting. Next, Chichikov repaired to the ViceGovernor's, and thence to the house of the Public Prosecutor, to that of the President of the Local Council, to that of the Chief of Police, to that of the Commissioner of Taxes, and to that of the local Director of State Factories. True, the task of remembering every big-wig in this world of ours is not a very easy one; but at least our visitor displayed the greatest activity in his work of paying calls, seeing that he went so far as to pay his respects also to the Inspector of the Municipal Department of Medicine and to the City Architect. Thereafter he sat thoughtfully in his britchka—plunged in meditation on the subject of whom else it might be well to visit. However, not a single magnate had been neglected, and in conversation with his hosts he had contrived to flatter each separate one. For instance to the Governor he had hinted that a stranger, on arriving in his, the Governor's province, would conceive that he had reached Paradise, so velvety were the roads. “Governors who appoint capable subordinates,” had said Chichikov, “are deserving of the most ample meed of praise.” Again, to the Chief of Police our hero had passed a most gratifying remark on the subject of the local gendarmery; while in his conversation with the Vice-Governor and the President of the Local Council (neither of whom had, as yet, risen above the rank of State Councillor) he had twice been guilty of the gaucherie of addressing his interlocutors with the title of “Your Excellency”—a blunder which had not failed to delight them. In the result the Governor had invited him to a reception the same evening, and certain other officials had followed suit by inviting him, one of them to dinner, a second to a tea-party, and so forth, and so forth.

Of himself, however, the traveller had spoken little; or, if he had spoken at any length, he had done so in a general sort of way and with marked modesty. Indeed, at moments of the kind his discourse had assumed something of a literary vein, in that invariably he had stated that, being a worm of no account in the world, he was deserving of no consideration at the hands of his fellows; that in his time he had undergone many strange experiences; that subsequently he had suffered much in the cause of Truth; that he had many enemies seeking his life; and that, being desirous of rest, he was now engaged in searching for a spot wherein to dwell—wherefore, having stumbled upon the town in which he now found himself, he had considered it his bounden duty to evince his respect for the chief authorities of the place. This, and no more, was all that, for the moment, the town succeeded in learning about the new arrival. Naturally he lost no time in presenting himself at the Governor's evening party. First, however, his preparations for that function occupied a space of over two hours, and necessitated an attention to his toilet of a kind not commonly seen. That is to say, after a brief post-grandial nap he called for soap and water, and spent a considerable period in the task of scrubbing his cheeks (which, for the purpose, he supported from within with his tongue) and then of drying his full, round face, from the ears downwards, with a towel which he took from the waiter's shoulder. Twice he snorted into the waiter's countenance as he did this, and then he posted himself in front of the mirror, donned a false shirt-front, plucked out a couple of hairs which were protruding from his nose, and appeared vested in a frockcoat of bilberry-coloured check. Thereafter driving through broad streets sparsely lighted with lanterns, he arrived at the Governor's residence to find it illuminated as for a ball. Barouches with gleaming lamps, a couple of gendarmes posted before the doors, a babel of postillions' cries—nothing of a kind likely to be impressive was wanting; and, on reaching the salon, the visitor actually found himself obliged to close his eyes for a moment, so strong was the mingled sheen of lamps, candles, and feminine apparel. Everything seemed suffused with light, and everywhere, flitting and flashing, were to be seen black coats—even as on a hot summer's day flies revolve around a sugar loaf while the old housekeeper is cutting it into cubes before the open window, and the children of the house crowd around her to watch the movements of her rugged hands as those members ply the smoking pestle; and airy squadrons of flies, borne on the breeze, enter boldly, as though free of the house, and, taking advantage of the fact that the glare of the sunshine is troubling the old lady's sight, disperse themselves over broken and unbroken fragments alike, even though the lethargy induced by the opulence of summer and the rich shower of dainties to be encountered at every step has induced them to enter less for the purpose of eating than for that of showing themselves in public, of parading up and down the sugar loaf, of rubbing both their hindquarters and their fore against one another, of cleaning their bodies under the wings, of extending their forelegs over their heads and grooming themselves, and of flying out of the window again to return with other predatory squadrons. Indeed, so dazed was Chichikov that scarcely did he realise that the Governor was taking him by the arm and presenting him to his (the Governor's) lady. Yet the newly-arrived guest kept his head sufficiently to contrive to murmur some such compliment as might fittingly come from a middle-aged individual of a rank neither excessively high nor excessively low. Next, when couples had been formed for dancing and the remainder of the company found itself pressed back against the walls, Chichikov folded his arms, and carefully scrutinised the dancers. Some of the ladies were dressed well and in the fashion, while the remainder were clad in such garments as God usually bestows upon a provincial town. Also here, as elsewhere, the men belonged to two separate and distinct categories; one of which comprised slender individuals who, flitting around the ladies, were scarcely to be distinguished from denizens of the metropolis, so carefully, so artistically, groomed were their whiskers, so presentable their oval, clean-shaven faces, so easy the manner of their dancing attendance upon their womenfolk, so glib their French conversation as they quizzed their female companions. As for the other category, it comprised individuals who, stout, or of the same build as Chichikov (that is to say, neither very portly nor very lean), backed and sidled away from the ladies, and kept peering hither and thither to see whether the Governor's footmen had set out green tables for whist. Their features were full and plump, some of them had beards, and in no case was their hair curled or waved or arranged in what the French call “the devil-may-care” style. On the contrary, their heads were either close-cropped or brushed very smooth, and their faces were round and firm. This category represented the more respectable officials of the town. In passing, I may say that in business matters fat men always prove superior to their leaner brethren; which is probably the reason why the latter are mostly to be found in the Political Police, or acting as mere ciphers whose existence is a purely hopeless, airy, trivial one. Again, stout individuals never take a back seat, but always a front one, and, wheresoever it be, they sit firmly, and with confidence, and decline to budge even though the seat crack and bend with their weight. For comeliness of exterior they care not a rap, and therefore a dress coat sits less easily on their figures than is the case with figures of leaner individuals. Yet invariably fat men amass the greater wealth. In three years' time a thin man will not have a single serf whom he has left unpledged; whereas—well, pray look at a fat man's fortunes, and what will you see? First of all a suburban villa, and then a larger suburban villa, and then a villa close to a town, and lastly a country estate which comprises every amenity! That is to say, having served both God and the State, the stout individual has won universal respect, and will end by retiring from business, reordering his mode of life, and becoming a Russian landowner—in other words, a fine gentleman who dispenses hospitality, lives in comfort and luxury, and is destined to leave his property to heirs who are purposing to squander the same on foreign travel. That the foregoing represents pretty much the gist of Chichikov's reflections as he stood watching the company I will not attempt to deny. And of those reflections the upshot was that he decided to join himself to the stouter section of the guests, among whom he had already recognised several familiar faces—namely, those of the Public Prosecutor (a man with beetling brows over eyes which seemed to be saying with a wink, “Come into the next room, my friend, for I have something to say to you”—though, in the main, their owner was a man of grave and taciturn habit), of the Postmaster (an insignificant-looking individual, yet a would-be wit and a philosopher), and of the President of the Local Council (a man of much amiability and good sense). These three personages greeted Chichikov as an old acquaintance, and to their salutations he responded with a sidelong, yet a sufficiently civil, bow. Also, he became acquainted with an extremely unctuous and approachable landowner named Manilov, and with a landowner of more uncouth exterior named Sobakevitch—the latter of whom began the acquaintance by treading heavily upon Chichikov's toes, and then begging his pardon. Next, Chichikov received an offer of a “cut in” at whist, and accepted the same with his usual courteous inclination of the head. Seating themselves at a green table, the party did not rise therefrom till supper time; and during that period all conversation between the players became hushed, as is the custom when men have given themselves up to a really serious pursuit. Even the Postmaster—a talkative man by nature—had no sooner taken the cards into his hands than he assumed an expression of profound thought, pursed his lips, and retained this attitude unchanged throughout the game. Only when playing a court card was it his custom to strike the table with his fist, and to exclaim (if the card happened to be a queen), “Now, old popadia!” and (if the card happened to be a king), “Now, peasant of Tambov!” To which ejaculations invariably the President of the Local Council retorted, “Ah, I have him by the ears, I have him by the ears!” And from the neighbourhood of the table other strong ejaculations relative to the play would arise, interposed with one or another of those nicknames which participants in a game are apt to apply to members of the various suits. I need hardly add that, the game over, the players fell to quarrelling, and that in the dispute our friend joined, though so artfully as to let every one see that, in spite of the fact that he was wrangling, he was doing so only in the most amicable fashion possible. Never did he say outright, “You played the wrong card at such and such a point.” No, he always employed some such phrase as, “You permitted yourself to make a slip, and thus afforded me the honour of covering your deuce.” Indeed, the better to keep in accord with his antagonists, he kept offering them his silver-enamelled snuffbox (at the bottom of which lay a couple of violets, placed there for the sake of their scent). In particular did the newcomer pay attention to landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch; so much so that his haste to arrive on good terms with them led to his leaving the President and the Postmaster rather in the shade. At the same time, certain questions which he put to those two landowners evinced not only curiosity, but also a certain amount of sound intelligence; for he began by asking how many peasant souls each of them possessed, and how their affairs happened at present to be situated, and then proceeded to enlighten himself also as their standing and their families. Indeed, it was not long before he had succeeded in fairly enchanting his new friends. In particular did Manilov—a man still in his prime, and possessed of a pair of eyes which, sweet as sugar, blinked whenever he laughed—find himself unable to make enough of his enchanter. Clasping Chichikov long and fervently by the hand, he besought him to do him, Manilov, the honour of visiting his country house (which he declared to lie at a distance of not more than fifteen versts from the boundaries of the town); and in return Chichikov averred (with an exceedingly affable bow and a most sincere handshake) that he was prepared not only to fulfil his friend's behest, but also to look upon the fulfilling of it as a sacred duty. In the same way Sobakevitch said to him laconically: “And do you pay ME a visit,” and then proceeded to shuffle a pair of boots of such dimensions that to find a pair to correspond with them would have been indeed difficult—more especially at the present day, when the race of epic heroes is beginning to die out in Russia.

Next day Chichikov dined and spent the evening at the house of the Chief of Police—a residence where, three hours after dinner, every one sat down to whist, and remained so seated until two o'clock in the morning. On this occasion Chichikov made the acquaintance of, among others, a landowner named Nozdrev—a dissipated little fellow of thirty who had no sooner exchanged three or four words with his new acquaintance than he began to address him in the second person singular. Yet although he did the same to the Chief of Police and the Public Prosecutor, the company had no sooner seated themselves at the card-table than both the one and the other of these functionaries started to keep a careful eye upon Nozdrev's tricks, and to watch practically every card which he played. The following evening Chichikov spent with the President of the Local Council, who received his guests—even though the latter included two ladies—in a greasy dressing-gown. Upon that followed an evening at the Vice-Governor's, a large dinner party at the house of the Commissioner of Taxes, a smaller dinner-party at the house of the Public Prosecutor (a very wealthy man), and a subsequent reception given by the Mayor. In short, not an hour of the day did Chichikov find himself forced to spend at home, and his return to the inn became necessary only for the purposes of sleeping. Somehow or other he had landed on his feet, and everywhere he figured as an experienced man of the world. No matter what the conversation chanced to be about, he always contrived to maintain his part in the same. Did the discourse turn upon horse-breeding, upon horse-breeding he happened to be peculiarly well-qualified to speak. Did the company fall to discussing well-bred dogs, at once he had remarks of the most pertinent kind possible to offer. Did the company touch upon a prosecution which had recently been carried out by the Excise Department, instantly he showed that he too was not wholly unacquainted with legal affairs. Did an opinion chance to be expressed concerning billiards, on that subject too he was at least able to avoid committing a blunder. Did a reference occur to virtue, concerning virtue he hastened to deliver himself in a way which brought tears to every eye. Did the subject in hand happen to be the distilling of brandy—well, that was a matter concerning which he had the soundest of knowledge. Did any one happen to mention Customs officials and inspectors, from that moment he expatiated as though he too had been both a minor functionary and a major. Yet a remarkable fact was the circumstance that he always contrived to temper his omniscience with a certain readiness to give way, a certain ability so to keep a rein upon himself that never did his utterances become too loud or too soft, or transcend what was perfectly befitting. In a word, he was always a gentleman of excellent manners, and every official in the place felt pleased when he saw him enter the door. Thus the Governor gave it as his opinion that Chichikov was a man of excellent intentions; the Public Prosecutor, that he was a good man of business; the Chief of Gendarmery, that he was a man of education; the President of the Local Council, that he was a man of breeding and refinement; and the wife of the Chief of Gendarmery, that his politeness of behaviour was equalled only by his affability of bearing. Nay, even Sobakevitch—who as a rule never spoke well of ANY ONE—said to his lanky wife when, on returning late from the town, he undressed and betook himself to bed by her side: “My dear, this evening, after dining with the Chief of Police, I went on to the Governor's, and met there, among others, a certain Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, who is a Collegiate Councillor and a very pleasant fellow.” To this his spouse replied “Hm!” and then dealt him a hearty kick in the ribs.

Such were the flattering opinions earned by the newcomer to the town; and these opinions he retained until the time when a certain speciality of his, a certain scheme of his (the reader will learn presently what it was), plunged the majority of the townsfolk into a sea of perplexity.





CHAPTER II


For more than two weeks the visitor lived amid a round of evening parties and dinners; wherefore he spent (as the saying goes) a very pleasant time. Finally he decided to extend his visits beyond the urban boundaries by going and calling upon landowners Manilov and Sobakevitch, seeing that he had promised on his honour to do so. Yet what really incited him to this may have been a more essential cause, a matter of greater gravity, a purpose which stood nearer to his heart, than the motive which I have just given; and of that purpose the reader will learn if only he will have the patience to read this prefatory narrative (which, lengthy though it be, may yet develop and expand in proportion as we approach the denouement with which the present work is destined to be crowned). One evening, therefore, Selifan the coachman received orders to have the horses harnessed in good time next morning; while Petrushka received orders to remain behind, for the purpose of looking after the portmanteau and the room. In passing, the reader may care to become more fully acquainted with the two serving-men of whom I have spoken. Naturally, they were not persons of much note, but merely what folk call characters of secondary, or even of tertiary, importance. Yet, despite the fact that the springs and the thread of this romance will not DEPEND upon them, but only touch upon them, and occasionally include them, the author has a passion for circumstantiality, and, like the average Russian, such a desire for accuracy as even a German could not rival. To what the reader already knows concerning the personages in hand it is therefore necessary to add that Petrushka usually wore a cast-off brown jacket of a size too large for him, as also that he had (according to the custom of individuals of his calling) a pair of thick lips and a very prominent nose. In temperament he was taciturn rather than loquacious, and he cherished a yearning for self-education. That is to say, he loved to read books, even though their contents came alike to him whether they were books of heroic adventure or mere grammars or liturgical compendia. As I say, he perused every book with an equal amount of attention, and, had he been offered a work on chemistry, would have accepted that also. Not the words which he read, but the mere solace derived from the act of reading, was what especially pleased his mind; even though at any moment there might launch itself from the page some devil-sent word whereof he could make neither head nor tail. For the most part, his task of reading was performed in a recumbent position in the anteroom; which circumstance ended by causing his mattress to become as ragged and as thin as a wafer. In addition to his love of poring over books, he could boast of two habits which constituted two other essential features of his character— namely, a habit of retiring to rest in his clothes (that is to say, in the brown jacket above-mentioned) and a habit of everywhere bearing with him his own peculiar atmosphere, his own peculiar smell—a smell which filled any lodging with such subtlety that he needed but to make up his bed anywhere, even in a room hitherto untenanted, and to drag thither his greatcoat and other impedimenta, for that room at once to assume an air of having been lived in during the past ten years. Nevertheless, though a fastidious, and even an irritable, man, Chichikov would merely frown when his nose caught this smell amid the freshness of the morning, and exclaim with a toss of his head: “The devil only knows what is up with you! Surely you sweat a good deal, do you not? The best thing you can do is to go and take a bath.” To this Petrushka would make no reply, but, approaching, brush in hand, the spot where his master's coat would be pendent, or starting to arrange one and another article in order, would strive to seem wholly immersed in his work. Yet of what was he thinking as he remained thus silent? Perhaps he was saying to himself: “My master is a good fellow, but for him to keep on saying the same thing forty times over is a little wearisome.” Only God knows and sees all things; wherefore for a mere human being to know what is in the mind of a servant while his master is scolding him is wholly impossible. However, no more need be said about Petrushka.

On the other hand, Coachman Selifan—But here let me remark that I do not like engaging the reader's attention in connection with persons of a lower class than himself; for experience has taught me that we do not willingly familiarise ourselves with the lower orders—that it is the custom of the average Russian to yearn exclusively for information concerning persons on the higher rungs of the social ladder. In fact, even a bowing acquaintance with a prince or a lord counts, in his eyes, for more than do the most intimate of relations with ordinary folk. For the same reason the author feels apprehensive on his hero's account, seeing that he has made that hero a mere Collegiate Councillor—a mere person with whom Aulic Councillors might consort, but upon whom persons of the grade of full General would probably bestow one of those glances proper to a man who is cringing at their august feet. Worse still, such persons of the grade of General are likely to treat Chichikov with studied negligence—and to an author studied negligence spells death. However, in spite of the distressfulness of the foregoing possibilities, it is time that I returned to my hero. After issuing, overnight, the necessary orders, he awoke early, washed himself, rubbed himself from head to foot with a wet sponge (a performance executed only on Sundays—and the day in question happened to be a Sunday), shaved his face with such care that his cheeks issued of absolutely satin-like smoothness and polish, donned first his bilberry-coloured, spotted frockcoat, and then his bearskin overcoat, descended the staircase (attended, throughout, by the waiter) and entered his britchka. With a loud rattle the vehicle left the inn-yard, and issued into the street. A passing priest doffed his cap, and a few urchins in grimy shirts shouted, “Gentleman, please give a poor orphan a trifle!” Presently the driver noticed that a sturdy young rascal was on the point of climbing onto the splashboard; wherefore he cracked his whip and the britchka leapt forward with increased speed over the cobblestones. At last, with a feeling of relief, the travellers caught sight of macadam ahead, which promised an end both to the cobblestones and to sundry other annoyances. And, sure enough, after his head had been bumped a few more times against the boot of the conveyance, Chichikov found himself bowling over softer ground. On the town receding into the distance, the sides of the road began to be varied with the usual hillocks, fir trees, clumps of young pine, trees with old, scarred trunks, bushes of wild juniper, and so forth, Presently there came into view also strings of country villas which, with their carved supports and grey roofs (the latter looking like pendent, embroidered tablecloths), resembled, rather, bundles of old faggots. Likewise the customary peasants, dressed in sheepskin jackets, could be seen yawning on benches before their huts, while their womenfolk, fat of feature and swathed of bosom, gazed out of upper windows, and the windows below displayed, here a peering calf, and there the unsightly jaws of a pig. In short, the view was one of the familiar type. After passing the fifteenth verst-stone Chichikov suddenly recollected that, according to Manilov, fifteen versts was the exact distance between his country house and the town; but the sixteenth verst stone flew by, and the said country house was still nowhere to be seen. In fact, but for the circumstance that the travellers happened to encounter a couple of peasants, they would have come on their errand in vain. To a query as to whether the country house known as Zamanilovka was anywhere in the neighbourhood the peasants replied by doffing their caps; after which one of them who seemed to boast of a little more intelligence than his companion, and who wore a wedge-shaped beard, made answer:

“Perhaps you mean Manilovka—not Zamanilovka?”

“Yes, yes—Manilovka.”

“Manilovka, eh? Well, you must continue for another verst, and then you will see it straight before you, on the right.”

“On the right?” re-echoed the coachman.

“Yes, on the right,” affirmed the peasant. “You are on the proper road for Manilovka, but Zamanilovka—well, there is no such place. The house you mean is called Manilovka because Manilovka is its name; but no house at all is called Zamanilovka. The house you mean stands there, on that hill, and is a stone house in which a gentleman lives, and its name is Manilovka; but Zamanilovka does not stand hereabouts, nor ever has stood.”

So the travellers proceeded in search of Manilovka, and, after driving an additional two versts, arrived at a spot whence there branched off a byroad. Yet two, three, or four versts of the by-road had been covered before they saw the least sign of a two-storied stone mansion. Then it was that Chichikov suddenly recollected that, when a friend has invited one to visit his country house, and has said that the distance thereto is fifteen versts, the distance is sure to turn out to be at least thirty. Not many people would have admired the situation of Manilov's abode, for it stood on an isolated rise and was open to every wind that blew. On the slope of the rise lay closely-mown turf, while, disposed here and there, after the English fashion, were flower-beds containing clumps of lilac and yellow acacia. Also, there were a few insignificant groups of slender-leaved, pointed-tipped birch trees, with, under two of the latter, an arbour having a shabby green cupola, some blue-painted wooden supports, and the inscription “This is the Temple of Solitary Thought.” Lower down the slope lay a green-coated pond—green-coated ponds constitute a frequent spectacle in the gardens of Russian landowners; and, lastly, from the foot of the declivity there stretched a line of mouldy, log-built huts which, for some obscure reason or another, our hero set himself to count. Up to two hundred or more did he count, but nowhere could he perceive a single leaf of vegetation or a single stick of timber. The only thing to greet the eye was the logs of which the huts were constructed. Nevertheless the scene was to a certain extent enlivened by the spectacle of two peasant women who, with clothes picturesquely tucked up, were wading knee-deep in the pond and dragging behind them, with wooden handles, a ragged fishing-net, in the meshes of which two crawfish and a roach with glistening scales were entangled. The women appeared to have cause of dispute between themselves—to be rating one another about something. In the background, and to one side of the house, showed a faint, dusky blur of pinewood, and even the weather was in keeping with the surroundings, since the day was neither clear nor dull, but of the grey tint which may be noted in uniforms of garrison soldiers which have seen long service. To complete the picture, a cock, the recognised harbinger of atmospheric mutations, was present; and, in spite of the fact that a certain connection with affairs of gallantry had led to his having had his head pecked bare by other cocks, he flapped a pair of wings—appendages as bare as two pieces of bast—and crowed loudly. As Chichikov approached the courtyard of the mansion he caught sight of his host (clad in a green frock coat) standing on the verandah and pressing one hand to his eyes to shield them from the sun and so get a better view of the approaching carriage. In proportion as the britchka drew nearer and nearer to the verandah, the host's eyes assumed a more and more delighted expression, and his smile a broader and broader sweep.

“Paul Ivanovitch!” he exclaimed when at length Chichikov leapt from the vehicle. “Never should I have believed that you would have remembered us!”

The two friends exchanged hearty embraces, and Manilov then conducted his guest to the drawing-room. During the brief time that they are traversing the hall, the anteroom, and the dining-room, let me try to say something concerning the master of the house. But such an undertaking bristles with difficulties—it promises to be a far less easy task than the depicting of some outstanding personality which calls but for a wholesale dashing of colours upon the canvas—the colours of a pair of dark, burning eyes, a pair of dark, beetling brows, a forehead seamed with wrinkles, a black, or a fiery-red, cloak thrown backwards over the shoulder, and so forth, and so forth. Yet, so numerous are Russian serf owners that, though careful scrutiny reveals to one's sight a quantity of outre peculiarities, they are, as a class, exceedingly difficult to portray, and one needs to strain one's faculties to the utmost before it becomes possible to pick out their variously subtle, their almost invisible, features. In short, one needs, before doing this, to carry out a prolonged probing with the aid of an insight sharpened in the acute school of research.

Only God can say what Manilov's real character was. A class of men exists whom the proverb has described as “men unto themselves, neither this nor that—neither Bogdan of the city nor Selifan of the village.” And to that class we had better assign also Manilov. Outwardly he was presentable enough, for his features were not wanting in amiability, but that amiability was a quality into which there entered too much of the sugary element, so that his every gesture, his every attitude, seemed to connote an excess of eagerness to curry favour and cultivate a closer acquaintance. On first speaking to the man, his ingratiating smile, his flaxen hair, and his blue eyes would lead one to say, “What a pleasant, good-tempered fellow he seems!” yet during the next moment or two one would feel inclined to say nothing at all, and, during the third moment, only to say, “The devil alone knows what he is!” And should, thereafter, one not hasten to depart, one would inevitably become overpowered with the deadly sense of ennui which comes of the intuition that nothing in the least interesting is to be looked for, but only a series of wearisome utterances of the kind which are apt to fall from the lips of a man whose hobby has once been touched upon. For every man HAS his hobby. One man's may be sporting dogs; another man's may be that of believing himself to be a lover of music, and able to sound the art to its inmost depths; another's may be that of posing as a connoisseur of récherchécookery; another's may be that of aspiring to play roles of a kind higher than nature has assigned him; another's (though this is a more limited ambition) may be that of getting drunk, and of dreaming that he is edifying both his friends, his acquaintances, and people with whom he has no connection at all by walking arm-in-arm with an Imperial aide-de-camp; another's may be that of possessing a hand able to chip corners off aces and deuces of diamonds; another's may be that of yearning to set things straight—in other words, to approximate his personality to that of a stationmaster or a director of posts. In short, almost every man has his hobby or his leaning; yet Manilov had none such, for at home he spoke little, and spent the greater part of his time in meditation—though God only knows what that meditation comprised! Nor can it be said that he took much interest in the management of his estate, for he never rode into the country, and the estate practically managed itself. Whenever the bailiff said to him, “It might be well to have such-and-such a thing done,” he would reply, “Yes, that is not a bad idea,” and then go on smoking his pipe—a habit which he had acquired during his service in the army, where he had been looked upon as an officer of modesty, delicacy, and refinement. “Yes, it is NOT a bad idea,” he would repeat. Again, whenever a peasant approached him and, rubbing the back of his neck, said “Barin, may I have leave to go and work for myself, in order that I may earn my obrok ?” he would snap out, with pipe in mouth as usual, “Yes, go!” and never trouble his head as to whether the peasant's real object might not be to go and get drunk. True, at intervals he would say, while gazing from the verandah to the courtyard, and from the courtyard to the pond, that it would be indeed splendid if a carriage drive could suddenly materialise, and the pond as suddenly become spanned with a stone bridge, and little shops as suddenly arise whence pedlars could dispense the petty merchandise of the kind which peasantry most need. And at such moments his eyes would grow winning, and his features assume an expression of intense satisfaction. Yet never did these projects pass beyond the stage of debate. Likewise there lay in his study a book with the fourteenth page permanently turned down. It was a book which he had been reading for the past two years! In general, something seemed to be wanting in the establishment. For instance, although the drawing-room was filled with beautiful furniture, and upholstered in some fine silken material which clearly had cost no inconsiderable sum, two of the chairs lacked any covering but bast, and for some years past the master had been accustomed to warn his guests with the words, “Do not sit upon these chairs; they are not yet ready for use.” Another room contained no furniture at all, although, a few days after the marriage, it had been said: “My dear, to-morrow let us set about procuring at least some TEMPORARY furniture for this room.” Also, every evening would see placed upon the drawing-room table a fine bronze candelabrum, a statuette representative of the Three Graces, a tray inlaid with mother-of-pearl, and a rickety, lop-sided copper invalide. Yet of the fact that all four articles were thickly coated with grease neither the master of the house nor the mistress nor the servants seemed to entertain the least suspicion. At the same time, Manilov and his wife were quite satisfied with each other. More than eight years had elapsed since their marriage, yet one of them was for ever offering his or her partner a piece of apple or a bonbon or a nut, while murmuring some tender something which voiced a wholehearted affection. “Open your mouth, dearest”—thus ran the formula—“and let me pop into it this titbit.” You may be sure that on such occasions the “dearest mouth” parted its lips most graciously! For their mutual birthdays the pair always contrived some “surprise present” in the shape of a glass receptacle for tooth-powder, or what not; and as they sat together on the sofa he would suddenly, and for some unknown reason, lay aside his pipe, and she her work (if at the moment she happened to be holding it in her hands) and husband and wife would imprint upon one another's cheeks such a prolonged and languishing kiss that during its continuance you could have smoked a small cigar. In short, they were what is known as “a very happy couple.” Yet it may be remarked that a household requires other pursuits to be engaged in than lengthy embracings and the preparing of cunning “surprises.” Yes, many a function calls for fulfilment. For instance, why should it be thought foolish or low to superintend the kitchen? Why should care not be taken that the storeroom never lacks supplies? Why should a housekeeper be allowed to thieve? Why should slovenly and drunken servants exist? Why should a domestic staff be suffered in indulge in bouts of unconscionable debauchery during its leisure time? Yet none of these things were thought worthy of consideration by Manilov's wife, for she had been gently brought up, and gentle nurture, as we all know, is to be acquired only in boarding schools, and boarding schools, as we know, hold the three principal subjects which constitute the basis of human virtue to be the French language (a thing indispensable to the happiness of married life), piano-playing (a thing wherewith to beguile a husband's leisure moments), and that particular department of housewifery which is comprised in the knitting of purses and other “surprises.” Nevertheless changes and improvements have begun to take place, since things now are governed more by the personal inclinations and idiosyncracies of the keepers of such establishments. For instance, in some seminaries the regimen places piano-playing first, and the French language second, and then the above department of housewifery; while in other seminaries the knitting of “surprises” heads the list, and then the French language, and then the playing of pianos—so diverse are the systems in force! None the less, I may remark that Madame Manilov—But let me confess that I always shrink from saying too much about ladies. Moreover, it is time that we returned to our heroes, who, during the past few minutes, have been standing in front of the drawing-room door, and engaged in urging one another to enter first.

“Pray be so good as not to inconvenience yourself on my account,” said Chichikov. “I will follow YOU.”

“No, Paul Ivanovitch—no! You are my guest.” And Manilov pointed towards the doorway.

“Make no difficulty about it, I pray,” urged Chichikov. “I beg of you to make no difficulty about it, but to pass into the room.”

“Pardon me, I will not. Never could I allow so distinguished and so welcome a guest as yourself to take second place.”

“Why call me ‘distinguished,’ my dear sir? I beg of you to proceed.”

“Nay; be YOU pleased to do so.”

“And why?”

“For the reason which I have stated.” And Manilov smiled his very pleasantest smile.

Finally the pair entered simultaneously and sideways; with the result that they jostled one another not a little in the process.

“Allow me to present to you my wife,” continued Manilov. “My dear— Paul Ivanovitch.”

Upon that Chichikov caught sight of a lady whom hitherto he had overlooked, but who, with Manilov, was now bowing to him in the doorway. Not wholly of unpleasing exterior, she was dressed in a well-fitting, high-necked morning dress of pale-coloured silk; and as the visitor entered the room her small white hands threw something upon the table and clutched her embroidered skirt before rising from the sofa where she had been seated. Not without a sense of pleasure did Chichikov take her hand as, lisping a little, she declared that she and her husband were equally gratified by his coming, and that, of late, not a day had passed without her husband recalling him to mind.

“Yes,” affirmed Manilov; “and every day SHE has said to ME: ‘Why does not your friend put in an appearance?’ ‘Wait a little dearest,’ I have always replied. ‘Twill not be long now before he comes.’ And you HAVE come, you HAVE honoured us with a visit, you HAVE bestowed upon us a treat—a treat destined to convert this day into a gala day, a true birthday of the heart.”

The intimation that matters had reached the point of the occasion being destined to constitute a “true birthday of the heart” caused Chichikov to become a little confused; wherefore he made modest reply that, as a matter of fact, he was neither of distinguished origin nor distinguished rank.

“Ah, you ARE so,” interrupted Manilov with his fixed and engaging smile. “You are all that, and more.”

“How like you our town?” queried Madame. “Have you spent an agreeable time in it?”

“Very,” replied Chichikov. “The town is an exceedingly nice one, and I have greatly enjoyed its hospitable society.”

“And what do you think of our Governor?”

“Yes; IS he not a most engaging and dignified personage?” added Manilov.

“He is all that,” assented Chichikov. “Indeed, he is a man worthy of the greatest respect. And how thoroughly he performs his duty according to his lights! Would that we had more like him!”

“And the tactfulness with which he greets every one!” added Manilov, smiling, and half-closing his eyes, like a cat which is being tickled behind the ears.

“Quite so,” assented Chichikov. “He is a man of the most eminent civility and approachableness. And what an artist! Never should I have thought he could have worked the marvellous household samplers which he has done! Some specimens of his needlework which he showed me could not well have been surpassed by any lady in the land!”

“And the Vice-Governor, too—he is a nice man, is he not?” inquired Manilov with renewed blinkings of the eyes.

“Who? The Vice-Governor? Yes, a most worthy fellow!” replied Chichikov.

“And what of the Chief of Police? Is it not a fact that he too is in the highest degree agreeable?”

“Very agreeable indeed. And what a clever, well-read individual! With him and the Public Prosecutor and the President of the Local Council I played whist until the cocks uttered their last morning crow. He is a most excellent fellow.”

“And what of his wife?” queried Madame Manilov. “Is she not a most gracious personality?”

“One of the best among my limited acquaintance,” agreed Chichikov.

Nor were the President of the Local Council and the Postmaster overlooked; until the company had run through the whole list of urban officials. And in every case those officials appeared to be persons of the highest possible merit.

“Do you devote your time entirely to your estate?” asked Chichikov, in his turn.

“Well, most of it,” replied Manilov; “though also we pay occasional visits to the town, in order that we may mingle with a little well-bred society. One grows a trifle rusty if one lives for ever in retirement.”

“Quite so,” agreed Chichikov.

“Yes, quite so,” capped Manilov. “At the same time, it would be a different matter if the neighbourhood were a GOOD one—if, for example, one had a friend with whom one could discuss manners and polite deportment, or engage in some branch of science, and so stimulate one's wits. For that sort of thing gives one's intellect an airing. It, it—” At a loss for further words, he ended by remarking that his feelings were apt to carry him away; after which he continued with a gesture: “What I mean is that, were that sort of thing possible, I, for one, could find the country and an isolated life possessed of great attractions. But, as matters stand, such a thing is NOT possible. All that I can manage to do is, occasionally, to read a little of A Son of the Fatherland.”

With these sentiments Chichikov expressed entire agreement: adding that nothing could be more delightful than to lead a solitary life in which there should be comprised only the sweet contemplation of nature and the intermittent perusal of a book.

“Nay, but even THAT were worth nothing had not one a friend with whom to share one's life,” remarked Manilov.

“True, true,” agreed Chichikov. “Without a friend, what are all the treasures in the world? ‘Possess not money,’ a wise man has said, ‘but rather good friends to whom to turn in case of need.’”

“Yes, Paul Ivanovitch,” said Manilov with a glance not merely sweet, but positively luscious—a glance akin to the mixture which even clever physicians have to render palatable before they can induce a hesitant patient to take it. “Consequently you may imagine what happiness—what PERFECT happiness, so to speak—the present occasion has brought me, seeing that I am permitted to converse with you and to enjoy your conversation.”

“But WHAT of my conversation?” replied Chichikov. “I am an insignificant individual, and, beyond that, nothing.”

“Oh, Paul Ivanovitch!” cried the other. “Permit me to be frank, and to say that I would give half my property to possess even a PORTION of the talents which you possess.”

“On the contrary, I should consider it the highest honour in the world if—”

The lengths to which this mutual outpouring of soul would have proceeded had not a servant entered to announce luncheon must remain a mystery.

“I humbly invite you to join us at table,” said Manilov. “Also, you will pardon us for the fact that we cannot provide a banquet such as is to be obtained in our metropolitan cities? We partake of simple fare, according to Russian custom—we confine ourselves to shtchi, but we do so with a single heart. Come, I humbly beg of you.”

After another contest for the honour of yielding precedence, Chichikov succeeded in making his way (in zigzag fashion) to the dining-room, where they found awaiting them a couple of youngsters. These were Manilov's sons, and boys of the age which admits of their presence at table, but necessitates the continued use of high chairs. Beside them was their tutor, who bowed politely and smiled; after which the hostess took her seat before her soup plate, and the guest of honour found himself esconsed between her and the master of the house, while the servant tied up the boys' necks in bibs.

“What charming children!” said Chichikov as he gazed at the pair. “And how old are they?”

“The eldest is eight,” replied Manilov, “and the younger one attained the age of six yesterday.”

“Themistocleus,” went on the father, turning to his first-born, who was engaged in striving to free his chin from the bib with which the footman had encircled it. On hearing this distinctly Greek name (to which, for some unknown reason, Manilov always appended the termination “eus”), Chichikov raised his eyebrows a little, but hastened, the next moment, to restore his face to a more befitting expression. “Themistocleus,” repeated the father, “tell me which is the finest city in France.”

Upon this the tutor concentrated his attention upon Themistocleus, and appeared to be trying hard to catch his eye. Only when Themistocleus had muttered “Paris” did the preceptor grow calmer, and nod his head.

“And which is the finest city in Russia?” continued Manilov.

Again the tutor's attitude became wholly one of concentration.

“St. Petersburg,” replied Themistocleus.

“And what other city?”

“Moscow,” responded the boy.

“Clever little dear!” burst out Chichikov, turning with an air of surprise to the father. “Indeed, I feel bound to say that the child evinces the greatest possible potentialities.”

“You do not know him fully,” replied the delighted Manilov. “The amount of sharpness which he possesses is extraordinary. Our younger one, Alkid, is not so quick; whereas his brother—well, no matter what he may happen upon (whether upon a cowbug or upon a water-beetle or upon anything else), his little eyes begin jumping out of his head, and he runs to catch the thing, and to inspect it. For HIM I am reserving a diplomatic post. Themistocleus,” added the father, again turning to his son, “do you wish to become an ambassador?”

“Yes, I do,” replied Themistocleus, chewing a piece of bread and wagging his head from side to side.

At this moment the lacquey who had been standing behind the future ambassador wiped the latter's nose; and well it was that he did so, since otherwise an inelegant and superfluous drop would have been added to the soup. After that the conversation turned upon the joys of a quiet life—though occasionally it was interrupted by remarks from the hostess on the subject of acting and actors. Meanwhile the tutor kept his eyes fixed upon the speakers' faces; and whenever he noticed that they were on the point of laughing he at once opened his mouth, and laughed with enthusiasm. Probably he was a man of grateful heart who wished to repay his employers for the good treatment which he had received. Once, however, his features assumed a look of grimness as, fixing his eyes upon his vis-à-vis, the boys, he tapped sternly upon the table. This happened at a juncture when Themistocleus had bitten Alkid on the ear, and the said Alkid, with frowning eyes and open mouth, was preparing himself to sob in piteous fashion; until, recognising that for such a proceeding he might possibly be deprived of his plate, he hastened to restore his mouth to its original expression, and fell tearfully to gnawing a mutton bone—the grease from which had soon covered his cheeks.

Every now and again the hostess would turn to Chichikov with the words, “You are eating nothing—you have indeed taken little;” but invariably her guest replied: “Thank you, I have had more than enough. A pleasant conversation is worth all the dishes in the world.” At length the company rose from table. Manilov was in high spirits, and, laying his hand upon his guest's shoulder, was on the point of conducting him to the drawing-room, when suddenly Chichikov intimated to him, with a meaning look, that he wished to speak to him on a very important matter.

“That being so,” said Manilov, “allow me to invite you into my study.” And he led the way to a small room which faced the blue of the forest. “This is my sanctum,” he added.

“What a pleasant apartment!” remarked Chichikov as he eyed it carefully. And, indeed, the room did not lack a certain attractiveness. The walls were painted a sort of blueish-grey colour, and the furniture consisted of four chairs, a settee, and a table—the latter of which bore a few sheets of writing-paper and the book of which I have before had occasion to speak. But the most prominent feature of the room was tobacco, which appeared in many different guises—in packets, in a tobacco jar, and in a loose heap strewn about the table. Likewise, both window sills were studded with little heaps of ash, arranged, not without artifice, in rows of more or less tidiness. Clearly smoking afforded the master of the house a frequent means of passing the time.

“Permit me to offer you a seat on this settee,” said Manilov. “Here you will be quieter than you would be in the drawing-room.”

“But I should prefer to sit upon this chair.”

“I cannot allow that,” objected the smiling Manilov. “The settee is specially reserved for my guests. Whether you choose or no, upon it you MUST sit.”

Accordingly Chichikov obeyed.

“And also let me hand you a pipe.”

“No, I never smoke,” answered Chichikov civilly, and with an assumed air of regret.

“And why?” inquired Manilov—equally civilly, but with a regret that was wholly genuine.

“Because I fear that I have never quite formed the habit, owing to my having heard that a pipe exercises a desiccating effect upon the system.”

“Then allow me to tell you that that is mere prejudice. Nay, I would even go so far as to say that to smoke a pipe is a healthier practice than to take snuff. Among its members our regiment numbered a lieutenant—a most excellent, well-educated fellow—who was simply INCAPABLE of removing his pipe from his mouth, whether at table or (pardon me) in other places. He is now forty, yet no man could enjoy better health than he has always done.”

Chichikov replied that such cases were common, since nature comprised many things which even the finest intellect could not compass.

“But allow me to put to you a question,” he went on in a tone in which there was a strange—or, at all events, RATHER a strange—note. For some unknown reason, also, he glanced over his shoulder. For some equally unknown reason, Manilov glanced over HIS.

“How long is it,” inquired the guest, “since you last rendered a census return?”

“Oh, a long, long time. In fact, I cannot remember when it was.”

“And since then have many of your serfs died?”

“I do not know. To ascertain that I should need to ask my bailiff. Footman, go and call the bailiff. I think he will be at home to-day.”

Before long the bailiff made his appearance. He was a man of under forty, clean-shaven, clad in a smock, and evidently used to a quiet life, seeing that his face was of that puffy fullness, and the skin encircling his slit-like eyes was of that sallow tint, which shows that the owner of those features is well acquainted with a feather bed. In a trice it could be seen that he had played his part in life as all such bailiffs do—that, originally a young serf of elementary education, he had married some Agashka of a housekeeper or a mistress's favourite, and then himself become housekeeper, and, subsequently, bailiff; after which he had proceeded according to the rules of his tribe—that is to say, he had consorted with and stood in with the more well-to-do serfs on the estate, and added the poorer ones to the list of forced payers of obrok, while himself leaving his bed at nine o'clock in the morning, and, when the samovar had been brought, drinking his tea at leisure.

“Look here, my good man,” said Manilov. “How many of our serfs have died since the last census revision?”

“How many of them have died? Why, a great many.” The bailiff hiccoughed, and slapped his mouth lightly after doing so.

“Yes, I imagined that to be the case,” corroborated Manilov. “In fact, a VERY great many serfs have died.” He turned to Chichikov and repeated the words.

“How many, for instance?” asked Chichikov.

“Yes; how many?” re-echoed Manilov.

“HOW many?” re-echoed the bailiff. “Well, no one knows the exact number, for no one has kept any account.”

“Quite so,” remarked Manilov. “I supposed the death-rate to have been high, but was ignorant of its precise extent.”

“Then would you be so good as to have it computed for me?” said Chichikov. “And also to have a detailed list of the deaths made out?”

“Yes, I will—a detailed list,” agreed Manilov.

“Very well.”

The bailiff departed.

“For what purpose do you want it?” inquired Manilov when the bailiff had gone.

The question seemed to embarrass the guest, for in Chichikov's face there dawned a sort of tense expression, and it reddened as though its owner were striving to express something not easy to put into words. True enough, Manilov was now destined to hear such strange and unexpected things as never before had greeted human ears.

“You ask me,” said Chichikov, “for what purpose I want the list. Well, my purpose in wanting it is this—that I desire to purchase a few peasants.” And he broke off in a gulp.

“But may I ask HOW you desire to purchase those peasants?” asked Manilov. “With land, or merely as souls for transferment—that is to say, by themselves, and without any land?”

“I want the peasants themselves only,” replied Chichikov. “And I want dead ones at that.”

“What?—Excuse me, but I am a trifle deaf. Really, your words sound most strange!”

“All that I am proposing to do,” replied Chichikov, “is to purchase the dead peasants who, at the last census, were returned by you as alive.”

Manilov dropped his pipe on the floor, and sat gaping. Yes, the two friends who had just been discussing the joys of camaraderie sat staring at one another like the portraits which, of old, used to hang on opposite sides of a mirror. At length Manilov picked up his pipe, and, while doing so, glanced covertly at Chichikov to see whether there was any trace of a smile to be detected on his lips—whether, in short, he was joking. But nothing of the sort could be discerned. On the contrary, Chichikov's face looked graver than usual. Next, Manilov wondered whether, for some unknown reason, his guest had lost his wits; wherefore he spent some time in gazing at him with anxious intentness. But the guest's eyes seemed clear—they contained no spark of the wild, restless fire which is apt to wander in the eyes of madmen. All was as it should be. Consequently, in spite of Manilov's cogitations, he could think of nothing better to do than to sit letting a stream of tobacco smoke escape from his mouth.

“So,” continued Chichikov, “what I desire to know is whether you are willing to hand over to me—to resign—these actually non-living, but legally living, peasants; or whether you have any better proposal to make?”

Manilov felt too confused and confounded to do aught but continue staring at his interlocutor.

“I think that you are disturbing yourself unnecessarily,” was Chichikov's next remark.

“I? Oh no! Not at all!” stammered Manilov. “Only—pardon me—I do not quite comprehend you. You see, never has it fallen to my lot to acquire the brilliant polish which is, so to speak, manifest in your every movement. Nor have I ever been able to attain the art of expressing myself well. Consequently, although there is a possibility that in the—er—utterances which have just fallen from your lips there may lie something else concealed, it may equally be that—er—you have been pleased so to express yourself for the sake of the beauty of the terms wherein that expression found shape?”

“Oh, no,” asserted Chichikov. “I mean what I say and no more. My reference to such of your pleasant souls as are dead was intended to be taken literally.”

Manilov still felt at a loss—though he was conscious that he MUST do something, he MUST propound some question. But what question? The devil alone knew! In the end he merely expelled some more tobacco smoke—this time from his nostrils as well as from his mouth.

“So,” went on Chichikov, “if no obstacle stands in the way, we might as well proceed to the completion of the purchase.”

“What? Of the purchase of the dead souls?”

“Of the ‘dead’ souls? Oh dear no! Let us write them down as LIVING ones, seeing that that is how they figure in the census returns. Never do I permit myself to step outside the civil law, great though has been the harm which that rule has wrought me in my career. In my eyes an obligation is a sacred thing. In the presence of the law I am dumb.”

These last words reassured Manilov not a little: yet still the meaning of the affair remained to him a mystery. By way of answer, he fell to sucking at his pipe with such vehemence that at length the pipe began to gurgle like a bassoon. It was as though he had been seeking of it inspiration in the present unheard-of juncture. But the pipe only gurgled, et praeterea nihil.

“Perhaps you feel doubtful about the proposal?” said Chichikov.

“Not at all,” replied Manilov. “But you will, I know, excuse me if I say (and I say it out of no spirit of prejudice, nor yet as criticising yourself in any way)—you will, I know, excuse me if I say that possibly this—er—this, er, SCHEME of yours, this—er—TRANSACTION of yours, may fail altogether to accord with the Civil Statutes and Provisions of the Realm?”

And Manilov, with a slight gesture of the head, looked meaningly into Chichikov's face, while displaying in his every feature, including his closely-compressed lips, such an expression of profundity as never before was seen on any human countenance—unless on that of some particularly sapient Minister of State who is debating some particularly abstruse problem.

Nevertheless Chichikov rejoined that the kind of scheme or transaction which he had adumbrated in no way clashed with the Civil Statutes and Provisions of Russia; to which he added that the Treasury would even BENEFIT by the enterprise, seeing it would draw therefrom the usual legal percentage.

“What, then, do you propose?” asked Manilov.

“I propose only what is above-board, and nothing else.”

“Then, that being so, it is another matter, and I have nothing to urge against it,” said Manilov, apparently reassured to the full.

“Very well,” remarked Chichikov. “Then we need only to agree as to the price.”

“As to the price?” began Manilov, and then stopped. Presently he went on: “Surely you cannot suppose me capable of taking money for souls which, in one sense at least, have completed their existence? Seeing that this fantastic whim of yours (if I may so call it?) has seized upon you to the extent that it has, I, on my side, shall be ready to surrender to you those souls UNCONDITIONALLY, and to charge myself with the whole expenses of the sale.”

I should be greatly to blame if I were to omit that, as soon as Manilov had pronounced these words, the face of his guest became replete with satisfaction. Indeed, grave and prudent a man though Chichikov was, he had much ado to refrain from executing a leap that would have done credit to a goat (an animal which, as we all know, finds itself moved to such exertions only during moments of the most ecstatic joy). Nevertheless the guest did at least execute such a convulsive shuffle that the material with which the cushions of the chair were covered came apart, and Manilov gazed at him with some misgiving. Finally Chichikov's gratitude led him to plunge into a stream of acknowledgement of a vehemence which caused his host to grow confused, to blush, to shake his head in deprecation, and to end by declaring that the concession was nothing, and that, his one desire being to manifest the dictates of his heart and the psychic magnetism which his friend exercised, he, in short, looked upon the dead souls as so much worthless rubbish.

“Not at all,” replied Chichikov, pressing his hand; after which he heaved a profound sigh. Indeed, he seemed in the right mood for outpourings of the heart, for he continued—not without a ring of emotion in his tone: “If you but knew the service which you have rendered to an apparently insignificant individual who is devoid both of family and kindred! For what have I not suffered in my time—I, a drifting barque amid the tempestuous billows of life? What harryings, what persecutions, have I not known? Of what grief have I not tasted? And why? Simply because I have ever kept the truth in view, because ever I have preserved inviolate an unsullied conscience, because ever I have stretched out a helping hand to the defenceless widow and the hapless orphan!” After which outpouring Chichikov pulled out his handkerchief, and wiped away a brimming tear.

Manilov's heart was moved to the core. Again and again did the two friends press one another's hands in silence as they gazed into one another's tear-filled eyes. Indeed, Manilov COULD not let go our hero's hand, but clasped it with such warmth that the hero in question began to feel himself at a loss how best to wrench it free: until, quietly withdrawing it, he observed that to have the purchase completed as speedily as possible would not be a bad thing; wherefore he himself would at once return to the town to arrange matters. Taking up his hat, therefore, he rose to make his adieus.

“What? Are you departing already?” said Manilov, suddenly recovering himself, and experiencing a sense of misgiving. At that moment his wife sailed into the room.

“Is Paul Ivanovitch leaving us so soon, dearest Lizanka?” she said with an air of regret.

“Yes. Surely it must be that we have wearied him?” her spouse replied.

“By no means,” asserted Chichikov, pressing his hand to his heart. “In this breast, madam, will abide for ever the pleasant memory of the time which I have spent with you. Believe me, I could conceive of no greater blessing than to reside, if not under the same roof as yourselves, at all events in your immediate neighbourhood.”

“Indeed?” exclaimed Manilov, greatly pleased with the idea. “How splendid it would be if you DID come to reside under our roof, so that we could recline under an elm tree together, and talk philosophy, and delve to the very root of things!”

“Yes, it WOULD be a paradisaical existence!” agreed Chichikov with a sigh. Nevertheless he shook hands with Madame. “Farewell, sudarina,” he said. “And farewell to YOU, my esteemed host. Do not forget what I have requested you to do.”

“Rest assured that I will not,” responded Manilov. “Only for a couple of days will you and I be parted from one another.”

With that the party moved into the drawing-room.

“Farewell, dearest children,” Chichikov went on as he caught sight of Alkid and Themistocleus, who were playing with a wooden hussar which lacked both a nose and one arm. “Farewell, dearest pets. Pardon me for having brought you no presents, but, to tell you the truth, I was not, until my visit, aware of your existence. However, now that I shall be coming again, I will not fail to bring you gifts. Themistocleus, to you I will bring a sword. You would like that, would you not?”

“I should,” replied Themistocleus.

“And to you, Alkid, I will bring a drum. That would suit you, would it not?” And he bowed in Alkid's direction.

“Zeth—a drum,” lisped the boy, hanging his head.

“Good! Then a drum it shall be—SUCH a beautiful drum! What a turr-r-ru-ing and a tra-ta-ta-ta-ing you will be able to kick up! Farewell, my darling.” And, kissing the boy's head, he turned to Manilov and Madame with the slight smile which one assumes before assuring parents of the guileless merits of their offspring.

“But you had better stay, Paul Ivanovitch,” said the father as the trio stepped out on to the verandah. “See how the clouds are gathering!”

“They are only small ones,” replied Chichikov.

“And you know your way to Sobakevitch's?”

“No, I do not, and should be glad if you would direct me.”

“If you like I will tell your coachman.” And in very civil fashion Manilov did so, even going so far as to address the man in the second person plural.

On hearing that he was to pass two turnings, and then to take a third, Selifan remarked, “We shall get there all right, sir,” and Chichikov departed amid a profound salvo of salutations and wavings of handkerchiefs on the part of his host and hostess, who raised themselves on tiptoe in their enthusiasm.

For a long while Manilov stood following the departing britchka with his eyes. In fact, he continued to smoke his pipe and gaze after the vehicle even when it had become lost to view. Then he re-entered the drawing-room, seated himself upon a chair, and surrendered his mind to the thought that he had shown his guest most excellent entertainment. Next, his mind passed imperceptibly to other matters, until at last it lost itself God only knows where. He thought of the amenities of a life, of friendship, and of how nice it would be to live with a comrade on, say, the bank of some river, and to span the river with a bridge of his own, and to build an enormous mansion with a facade lofty enough even to afford a view to Moscow. On that facade he and his wife and friend would drink afternoon tea in the open air, and discuss interesting subjects; after which, in a fine carriage, they would drive to some reunion or other, where with their pleasant manners they would so charm the company that the Imperial Government, on learning of their merits, would raise the pair to the grade of General or God knows what—that is to say, to heights whereof even Manilov himself could form no idea. Then suddenly Chichikov's extraordinary request interrupted the dreamer's reflections, and he found his brain powerless to digest it, seeing that, turn and turn the matter about as he might, he could not properly explain its bearing. Smoking his pipe, he sat where he was until supper time.





CHAPTER III


Meanwhile, Chichikov, seated in his britchka and bowling along the turnpike, was feeling greatly pleased with himself. From the preceding chapter the reader will have gathered the principal subject of his bent and inclinations: wherefore it is no matter for wonder that his body and his soul had ended by becoming wholly immersed therein. To all appearances the thoughts, the calculations, and the projects which were now reflected in his face partook of a pleasant nature, since momentarily they kept leaving behind them a satisfied smile. Indeed, so engrossed was he that he never noticed that his coachman, elated with the hospitality of Manilov's domestics, was making remarks of a didactic nature to the off horse of the troika , a skewbald. This skewbald was a knowing animal, and made only a show of pulling; whereas its comrades, the middle horse (a bay, and known as the Assessor, owing to his having been acquired from a gentleman of that rank) and the near horse (a roan), would do their work gallantly, and even evince in their eyes the pleasure which they derived from their exertions. “Ah, you rascal, you rascal! I'll get the better of you!” ejaculated Selifan as he sat up and gave the lazy one a cut with his whip. “YOU know your business all right, you German pantaloon! The bay is a good fellow, and does his duty, and I will give him a bit over his feed, for he is a horse to be respected; and the Assessor too is a good horse. But what are YOU shaking your ears for? You are a fool, so just mind when you're spoken to. 'Tis good advice I'm giving you, you blockhead. Ah! You CAN travel when you like.” And he gave the animal another cut, and then shouted to the trio, “Gee up, my beauties!” and drew his whip gently across the backs of the skewbald's comrades—not as a punishment, but as a sign of his approval. That done, he addressed himself to the skewbald again. “Do you think,” he cried, “that I don't see what you are doing? You can behave quite decently when you like, and make a man respect you.” With that he fell to recalling certain reminiscences. “They were NICE folk, those folk at the gentleman's yonder,” he mused. “I DO love a chat with a man when he is a good sort. With a man of that kind I am always hailfellow-well-met, and glad to drink a glass of tea with him, or to eat a biscuit. One CAN'T help respecting a decent fellow. For instance, this gentleman of mine—why, every one looks up to him, for he has been in the Government's service, and is a Collegiate Councillor.”

Thus soliloquising, he passed to more remote abstractions; until, had Chichikov been listening, he would have learnt a number of interesting details concerning himself. However, his thoughts were wholly occupied with his own subject, so much so that not until a loud clap of thunder awoke him from his reverie did he glance around him. The sky was completely covered with clouds, and the dusty turnpike beginning to be sprinkled with drops of rain. At length a second and a nearer and a louder peal resounded, and the rain descended as from a bucket. Falling slantwise, it beat upon one side of the basketwork of the tilt until the splashings began to spurt into his face, and he found himself forced to draw the curtains (fitted with circular openings through which to obtain a glimpse of the wayside view), and to shout to Selifan to quicken his pace. Upon that the coachman, interrupted in the middle of his harangue, bethought him that no time was to be lost; wherefore, extracting from under the box-seat a piece of old blanket, he covered over his sleeves, resumed the reins, and cheered on his threefold team (which, it may be said, had so completely succumbed to the influence of the pleasant lassitude induced by Selifan's discourse that it had taken to scarcely placing one leg before the other). Unfortunately, Selifan could not clearly remember whether two turnings had been passed or three. Indeed, on collecting his faculties, and dimly recalling the lie of the road, he became filled with a shrewd suspicion that A VERY LARGE NUMBER of turnings had been passed. But since, at moments which call for a hasty decision, a Russian is quick to discover what may conceivably be the best course to take, our coachman put away from him all ulterior reasoning, and, turning to the right at the next cross-road, shouted, “Hi, my beauties!” and set off at a gallop. Never for a moment did he stop to think whither the road might lead him!

It was long before the clouds had discharged their burden, and, meanwhile, the dust on the road became kneaded into mire, and the horses' task of pulling the britchka heavier and heavier. Also, Chichikov had taken alarm at his continued failure to catch sight of Sobakevitch's country house. According to his calculations, it ought to have been reached long ago. He gazed about him on every side, but the darkness was too dense for the eye to pierce.

“Selifan!” he exclaimed, leaning forward in the britchka.

“What is it, barin?” replied the coachman.

“Can you see the country house anywhere?”

“No, barin.” After which, with a flourish of the whip, the man broke into a sort of endless, drawling song. In that song everything had a place. By “everything” I mean both the various encouraging and stimulating cries with which Russian folk urge on their horses, and a random, unpremeditated selection of adjectives.

Meanwhile Chichikov began to notice that the britchka was swaying violently, and dealing him occasional bumps. Consequently he suspected that it had left the road and was being dragged over a ploughed field. Upon Selifan's mind there appeared to have dawned a similar inkling, for he had ceased to hold forth.

“You rascal, what road are you following?” inquired Chichikov.

“I don't know,” retorted the coachman. “What can a man do at a time of night when the darkness won't let him even see his whip?” And as Selifan spoke the vehicle tilted to an angle which left Chichikov no choice but to hang on with hands and teeth. At length he realised the fact that Selifan was drunk.

“Stop, stop, or you will upset us!” he shouted to the fellow.

“No, no, barin,” replied Selifan. “HOW could I upset you? To upset people is wrong. I know that very well, and should never dream of such conduct.” Here he started to turn the vehicle round a little—and kept on doing so until the britchka capsized on to its side, and Chichikov landed in the mud on his hands and knees. Fortunately Selifan succeeded in stopping the horses, although they would have stopped of themselves, seeing that they were utterly worn out. This unforeseen catastrophe evidently astonished their driver. Slipping from the box, he stood resting his hands against the side of the britchka, while Chichikov tumbled and floundered about in the mud, in a vain endeavour to wriggle clear of the stuff.

“Ah, you!” said Selifan meditatively to the britchka. “To think of upsetting us like this!”

“You are as drunk as a lord!” exclaimed Chichikov.

“No, no, barin. Drunk, indeed? Why, I know my manners too well. A word or two with a friend—that is all that I have taken. Any one may talk with a decent man when he meets him. There is nothing wrong in that. Also, we had a snack together. There is nothing wrong in a snack—especially a snack with a decent man.”

“What did I say to you when last you got drunk?” asked Chichikov. “Have you forgotten what I said then?”

“No, no, barin. HOW could I forget it? I know what is what, and know that it is not right to get drunk. All that I have been having is a word or two with a decent man, for the reason that—”

“Well, if I lay the whip about you, you'll know then how to talk to a decent fellow, I'll warrant!”

“As you please, barin,” replied the complacent Selifan. “Should you whip me, you will whip me, and I shall have nothing to complain of. Why should you not whip me if I deserve it? 'Tis for you to do as you like. Whippings are necessary sometimes, for a peasant often plays the fool, and discipline ought to be maintained. If I have deserved it, beat me. Why should you not?”

This reasoning seemed, at the moment, irrefutable, and Chichikov said nothing more. Fortunately fate had decided to take pity on the pair, for from afar their ears caught the barking of a dog. Plucking up courage, Chichikov gave orders for the britchka to be righted, and the horses to be urged forward; and since a Russian driver has at least this merit, that, owing to a keen sense of smell being able to take the place of eyesight, he can, if necessary, drive at random and yet reach a destination of some sort, Selifan succeeded, though powerless to discern a single object, in directing his steeds to a country house near by, and that with such a certainty of instinct that it was not until the shafts had collided with a garden wall, and thereby made it clear that to proceed another pace was impossible, that he stopped. All that Chichikov could discern through the thick veil of pouring rain was something which resembled a verandah. So he dispatched Selifan to search for the entrance gates, and that process would have lasted indefinitely had it not been shortened by the circumstance that, in Russia, the place of a Swiss footman is frequently taken by watchdogs; of which animals a number now proclaimed the travellers' presence so loudly that Chichikov found himself forced to stop his ears. Next, a light gleamed in one of the windows, and filtered in a thin stream to the garden wall—thus revealing the whereabouts of the entrance gates; whereupon Selifan fell to knocking at the gates until the bolts of the house door were withdrawn and there issued therefrom a figure clad in a rough cloak.

“Who is that knocking? What have you come for?” shouted the hoarse voice of an elderly woman.

“We are travellers, good mother,” said Chichikov. “Pray allow us to spend the night here.”

“Out upon you for a pair of gadabouts!” retorted the old woman. “A fine time of night to be arriving! We don't keep an hotel, mind you. This is a lady's residence.”

“But what are we to do, mother? We have lost our way, and cannot spend the night out of doors in such weather.”

“No, we cannot. The night is dark and cold,” added Selifan.

“Hold your tongue, you fool!” exclaimed Chichikov.

“Who ARE you, then?” inquired the old woman.

“A dvorianin, good mother.”

Somehow the word dvorianin seemed to give the old woman food for thought.

“Wait a moment,” she said, “and I will tell the mistress.”

Two minutes later she returned with a lantern in her hand, the gates were opened, and a light glimmered in a second window. Entering the courtyard, the britchka halted before a moderate-sized mansion. The darkness did not permit of very accurate observation being made, but, apparently, the windows only of one-half of the building were illuminated, while a quagmire in front of the door reflected the beams from the same. Meanwhile the rain continued to beat sonorously down upon the wooden roof, and could be heard trickling into a water butt; nor for a single moment did the dogs cease to bark with all the strength of their lungs. One of them, throwing up its head, kept venting a howl of such energy and duration that the animal seemed to be howling for a handsome wager; while another, cutting in between the yelpings of the first animal, kept restlessly reiterating, like a postman's bell, the notes of a very young puppy. Finally, an old hound which appeared to be gifted with a peculiarly robust temperament kept supplying the part of contrabasso, so that his growls resembled the rumbling of a bass singer when a chorus is in full cry, and the tenors are rising on tiptoe in their efforts to compass a particularly high note, and the whole body of choristers are wagging their heads before approaching a climax, and this contrabasso alone is tucking his bearded chin into his collar, and sinking almost to a squatting posture on the floor, in order to produce a note which shall cause the windows to shiver and their panes to crack. Naturally, from a canine chorus of such executants it might reasonably be inferred that the establishment was one of the utmost respectability. To that, however, our damp, cold hero gave not a thought, for all his mind was fixed upon bed. Indeed, the britchka had hardly come to a standstill before he leapt out upon the doorstep, missed his footing, and came within an ace of falling. To meet him there issued a female younger than the first, but very closely resembling her; and on his being conducted to the parlour, a couple of glances showed him that the room was hung with old striped curtains, and ornamented with pictures of birds and small, antique mirrors—the latter set in dark frames which were carved to resemble scrolls of foliage. Behind each mirror was stuck either a letter or an old pack of cards or a stocking, while on the wall hung a clock with a flowered dial. More, however, Chichikov could not discern, for his eyelids were as heavy as though smeared with treacle. Presently the lady of the house herself entered—an elderly woman in a sort of nightcap (hastily put on) and a flannel neck wrap. She belonged to that class of lady landowners who are for ever lamenting failures of the harvest and their losses thereby; to the class who, drooping their heads despondently, are all the while stuffing money into striped purses, which they keep hoarded in the drawers of cupboards. Into one purse they will stuff rouble pieces, into another half roubles, and into a third tchetvertachki , although from their mien you would suppose that the cupboard contained only linen and nightshirts and skeins of wool and the piece of shabby material which is destined—should the old gown become scorched during the baking of holiday cakes and other dainties, or should it fall into pieces of itself—to become converted into a new dress. But the gown never does get burnt or wear out, for the reason that the lady is too careful; wherefore the piece of shabby material reposes in its unmade-up condition until the priest advises that it be given to the niece of some widowed sister, together with a quantity of other such rubbish.

Chichikov apologised for having disturbed the household with his unexpected arrival. “Not at all, not at all,” replied the lady. “But in what dreadful weather God has brought you hither! What wind and what rain! You could not help losing your way. Pray excuse us for being unable to make better preparations for you at this time of night.”

Suddenly there broke in upon the hostess' words the sound of a strange hissing, a sound so loud that the guest started in alarm, and the more so seeing that it increased until the room seemed filled with adders. On glancing upwards, however, he recovered his composure, for he perceived the sound to be emanating from the clock, which appeared to be in a mind to strike. To the hissing sound there succeeded a wheezing one, until, putting forth its best efforts, the thing struck two with as much clatter as though some one had been hitting an iron pot with a cudgel. That done, the pendulum returned to its right-left, right-left oscillation.

Chichikov thanked his hostess kindly, and said that he needed nothing, and she must not put herself about: only for rest was he longing—though also he should like to know whither he had arrived, and whether the distance to the country house of land-owner Sobakevitch was anything very great. To this the lady replied that she had never so much as heard the name, since no gentleman of the name resided in the locality.

“But at least you are acquainted with landowner Manilov?” continued Chichikov.

“No. Who is he?”

“Another landed proprietor, madam.”

“Well, neither have I heard of him. No such landowner lives hereabouts.”

“Then who ARE your local landowners?”

“Bobrov, Svinin, Kanapatiev, Khapakin, Trepakin, and Plieshakov.”

“Are they rich men?”

“No, none of them. One of them may own twenty souls, and another thirty, but of gentry who own a hundred there are none.”

Chichikov reflected that he had indeed fallen into an aristocratic wilderness!

“At all events, is the town far away?” he inquired.

“About sixty versts. How sorry I am that I have nothing for you to eat! Should you care to drink some tea?”

“I thank you, good mother, but I require nothing beyond a bed.”

“Well, after such a journey you must indeed be needing rest, so you shall lie upon this sofa. Fetinia, bring a quilt and some pillows and sheets. What weather God has sent us! And what dreadful thunder! Ever since sunset I have had a candle burning before the ikon in my bedroom. My God! Why, your back and sides are as muddy as a boar's! However have you managed to get into such a state?”

“That I am nothing worse than muddy is indeed fortunate, since, but for the Almighty, I should have had my ribs broken.”

“Dear, dear! To think of all that you must have been through. Had I not better wipe your back?”

“I thank you, I thank you, but you need not trouble. Merely be so good as to tell your maid to dry my clothes.”

“Do you hear that, Fetinia?” said the hostess, turning to a woman who was engaged in dragging in a feather bed and deluging the room with feathers. “Take this coat and this vest, and, after drying them before the fire— just as we used to do for your late master—give them a good rub, and fold them up neatly.”

“Very well, mistress,” said Fetinia, spreading some sheets over the bed, and arranging the pillows.

“Now your bed is ready for you,” said the hostess to Chichikov. “Goodnight, dear sir. I wish you good-night. Is there anything else that you require? Perhaps you would like to have your heels tickled before retiring to rest? Never could my late husband get to sleep without that having been done.”

But the guest declined the proffered heel-tickling, and, on his hostess taking her departure, hastened to divest himself of his clothing, both upper and under, and to hand the garments to Fetinia. She wished him good-night, and removed the wet trappings; after which he found himself alone. Not without satisfaction did he eye his bed, which reached almost to the ceiling. Clearly Fetinia was a past mistress in the art of beating up such a couch, and, as the result, he had no sooner mounted it with the aid of a chair than it sank well-nigh to the floor, and the feathers, squeezed out of their proper confines, flew hither and thither into every corner of the apartment. Nevertheless he extinguished the candle, covered himself over with the chintz quilt, snuggled down beneath it, and instantly fell asleep. Next day it was late in the morning before he awoke. Through the window the sun was shining into his eyes, and the flies which, overnight, had been roosting quietly on the walls and ceiling now turned their attention to the visitor. One settled on his lip, another on his ear, a third hovered as though intending to lodge in his very eye, and a fourth had the temerity to alight just under his nostrils. In his drowsy condition he inhaled the latter insect, sneezed violently, and so returned to consciousness. He glanced around the room, and perceived that not all the pictures were representative of birds, since among them hung also a portrait of Kutuzov and an oil painting of an old man in a uniform with red facings such as were worn in the days of the Emperor Paul . At this moment the clock uttered its usual hissing sound, and struck ten, while a woman's face peered in at the door, but at once withdrew, for the reason that, with the object of sleeping as well as possible, Chichikov had removed every stitch of his clothing. Somehow the face seemed to him familiar, and he set himself to recall whose it could be. At length he recollected that it was the face of his hostess. His clothes he found lying, clean and dry, beside him; so he dressed and approached the mirror, meanwhile sneezing again with such vehemence that a cock which happened at the moment to be near the window (which was situated at no great distance from the ground) chuckled a short, sharp phrase. Probably it meant, in the bird's alien tongue, “Good morning to you!” Chichikov retorted by calling the bird a fool, and then himself approached the window to look at the view. It appeared to comprise a poulterer's premises. At all events, the narrow yard in front of the window was full of poultry and other domestic creatures—of game fowls and barn door fowls, with, among them, a cock which strutted with measured gait, and kept shaking its comb, and tilting its head as though it were trying to listen to something. Also, a sow and her family were helping to grace the scene. First, she rooted among a heap of litter; then, in passing, she ate up a young pullet; lastly, she proceeded carelessly to munch some pieces of melon rind. To this small yard or poultry-run a length of planking served as a fence, while beyond it lay a kitchen garden containing cabbages, onions, potatoes, beetroots, and other household vegetables. Also, the garden contained a few stray fruit trees that were covered with netting to protect them from the magpies and sparrows; flocks of which were even then wheeling and darting from one spot to another. For the same reason a number of scarecrows with outstretched arms stood reared on long poles, with, surmounting one of the figures, a cast-off cap of the hostess's. Beyond the garden again there stood a number of peasants' huts. Though scattered, instead of being arranged in regular rows, these appeared to Chichikov's eye to comprise well-to-do inhabitants, since all rotten planks in their roofing had been replaced with new ones, and none of their doors were askew, and such of their tiltsheds as faced him evinced evidence of a presence of a spare waggon—in some cases almost a new one. “This lady owns by no means a poor village,” said Chichikov to himself; wherefore he decided then and there to have a talk with his hostess, and to cultivate her closer acquaintance. Accordingly he peeped through the chink of the door whence her head had recently protruded, and, on seeing her seated at a tea table, entered and greeted her with a cheerful, kindly smile.

“Good morning, dear sir,” she responded as she rose. “How have you slept?” She was dressed in better style than she had been on the previous evening. That is to say, she was now wearing a gown of some dark colour, and lacked her nightcap, and had swathed her neck in something stiff.

“I have slept exceedingly well,” replied Chichikov, seating himself upon a chair. “And how are YOU, good madam?”

“But poorly, my dear sir.”

“And why so?”

“Because I cannot sleep. A pain has taken me in my middle, and my legs, from the ankles upwards, are aching as though they were broken.”

“That will pass, that will pass, good mother. You must pay no attention to it.”

“God grant that it MAY pass. However, I have been rubbing myself with lard and turpentine. What sort of tea will you take? In this jar I have some of the scented kind.”

“Excellent, good mother! Then I will take that.”

Probably the reader will have noticed that, for all his expressions of solicitude, Chichikov's tone towards his hostess partook of a freer, a more unceremonious, nature than that which he had adopted towards Madam Manilov. And here I should like to assert that, howsoever much, in certain respects, we Russians may be surpassed by foreigners, at least we surpass them in adroitness of manner. In fact the various shades and subtleties of our social intercourse defy enumeration. A Frenchman or a German would be incapable of envisaging and understanding all its peculiarities and differences, for his tone in speaking to a millionaire differs but little from that which he employs towards a small tobacconist—and that in spite of the circumstance that he is accustomed to cringe before the former. With us, however, things are different. In Russian society there exist clever folk who can speak in one manner to a landowner possessed of two hundred peasant souls, and in another to a landowner possessed of three hundred, and in another to a landowner possessed of five hundred. In short, up to the number of a million souls the Russian will have ready for each landowner a suitable mode of address. For example, suppose that somewhere there exists a government office, and that in that office there exists a director. I would beg of you to contemplate him as he sits among his myrmidons. Sheer nervousness will prevent you from uttering a word in his presence, so great are the pride and superiority depicted on his countenance. Also, were you to sketch him, you would be sketching a veritable Prometheus, for his glance is as that of an eagle, and he walks with measured, stately stride. Yet no sooner will the eagle have left the room to seek the study of his superior officer than he will go scurrying along (papers held close to his nose) like any partridge. But in society, and at the evening party (should the rest of those present be of lesser rank than himself) the Prometheus will once more become Prometheus, and the man who stands a step below him will treat him in a way never dreamt of by Ovid, seeing that each fly is of lesser account than its superior fly, and becomes, in the presence of the latter, even as a grain of sand. “Surely that is not Ivan Petrovitch?” you will say of such and such a man as you regard him. “Ivan Petrovitch is tall, whereas this man is small and spare. Ivan Petrovitch has a loud, deep voice, and never smiles, whereas this man (whoever he may be) is twittering like a sparrow, and smiling all the time.” Yet approach and take a good look at the fellow and you will see that is IS Ivan Petrovitch. “Alack, alack!” will be the only remark you can make.

Let us return to our characters in real life. We have seen that, on this occasion, Chichikov decided to dispense with ceremony; wherefore, taking up the teapot, he went on as follows:

“You have a nice little village here, madam. How many souls does it contain?”

“A little less than eighty, dear sir. But the times are hard, and I have lost a great deal through last year's harvest having proved a failure.”

“But your peasants look fine, strong fellows. May I enquire your name? Through arriving so late at night I have quite lost my wits.”

“Korobotchka, the widow of a Collegiate Secretary.”

“I humbly thank you. And your Christian name and patronymic?”

“Nastasia Petrovna.”

“Nastasia Petrovna! Those are excellent names. I have a maternal aunt named like yourself.”

“And YOUR name?” queried the lady. “May I take it that you are a Government Assessor?”

“No, madam,” replied Chichikov with a smile. “I am not an Assessor, but a traveller on private business.”

“Then you must be a buyer of produce? How I regret that I have sold my honey so cheaply to other buyers! Otherwise YOU might have bought it, dear sir.”

“I never buy honey.”

“Then WHAT do you buy, pray? Hemp? I have a little of that by me, but not more than half a pood or so.”

“No, madam. It is in other wares that I deal. Tell me, have you, of late years, lost many of your peasants by death?”

“Yes; no fewer than eighteen,” responded the old lady with a sigh. “Such a fine lot, too—all good workers! True, others have since grown up, but of what use are THEY? Mere striplings. When the Assessor last called upon me I could have wept; for, though those workmen of mine are dead, I have to keep on paying for them as though they were still alive! And only last week my blacksmith got burnt to death! Such a clever hand at his trade he was!”

“What? A fire occurred at your place?”

“No, no, God preserve us all! It was not so bad as that. You must understand that the blacksmith SET HIMSELF on fire—he got set on fire in his bowels through overdrinking. Yes, all of a sudden there burst from him a blue flame, and he smouldered and smouldered until he had turned as black as a piece of charcoal! Yet what a clever blacksmith he was! And now I have no horses to drive out with, for there is no one to shoe them.”

“In everything the will of God, madam,” said Chichikov with a sigh. “Against the divine wisdom it is not for us to rebel. Pray hand them over to me, Nastasia Petrovna.”

“Hand over whom?”

“The dead peasants.”

“But how could I do that?”

“Quite simply. Sell them to me, and I will give you some money in exchange.”

“But how am I to sell them to you? I scarcely understand what you mean. Am I to dig them up again from the ground?”

Chichikov perceived that the old lady was altogether at sea, and that he must explain the matter; wherefore in a few words he informed her that the transfer or purchase of the souls in question would take place merely on paper—that the said souls would be listed as still alive.

“And what good would they be to you?” asked his hostess, staring at him with her eyes distended.

“That is MY affair.”

“But they are DEAD souls.”

“Who said they were not? The mere fact of their being dead entails upon you a loss as dead as the souls, for you have to continue paying tax upon them, whereas MY plan is to relieve you both of the tax and of the resultant trouble. NOW do you understand? And I will not only do as I say, but also hand you over fifteen roubles per soul. Is that clear enough?”

“Yes—but I do not know,” said his hostess diffidently. “You see, never before have I sold dead souls.”

“Quite so. It would be a surprising thing if you had. But surely you do not think that these dead souls are in the least worth keeping?”

“Oh, no, indeed! Why should they be worth keeping? I am sure they are not so. The only thing which troubles me is the fact that they are DEAD.”

“She seems a truly obstinate old woman!” was Chichikov's inward comment. “Look here, madam,” he added aloud. “You reason well, but you are simply ruining yourself by continuing to pay the tax upon dead souls as though they were still alive.”

“Oh, good sir, do not speak of it!” the lady exclaimed. “Three weeks ago I took a hundred and fifty roubles to that Assessor, and buttered him up, and—”

“Then you see how it is, do you not? Remember that, according to my plan, you will never again have to butter up the Assessor, seeing that it will be I who will be paying for those peasants—I, not YOU, for I shall have taken over the dues upon them, and have transferred them to myself as so many bona fide serfs. Do you understand AT LAST?”

However, the old lady still communed with herself. She could see that the transaction would be to her advantage, yet it was one of such a novel and unprecedented nature that she was beginning to fear lest this purchaser of souls intended to cheat her. Certainly he had come from God only knew where, and at the dead of night, too!

“But, sir, I have never in my life sold dead folk—only living ones. Three years ago I transferred two wenches to Protopopov for a hundred roubles apiece, and he thanked me kindly, for they turned out splendid workers—able to make napkins or anything else.”

“Yes, but with the living we have nothing to do, damn it! I am asking you only about DEAD folk.”

“Yes, yes, of course. But at first sight I felt afraid lest I should be incurring a loss—lest you should be wishing to outwit me, good sir. You see, the dead souls are worth rather more than you have offered for them.”

“See here, madam. (What a woman it is!) HOW could they be worth more? Think for yourself. They are so much loss to you—so much loss, do you understand? Take any worthless, rubbishy article you like—a piece of old rag, for example. That rag will yet fetch its price, for it can be bought for paper-making. But these dead souls are good for NOTHING AT ALL. Can you name anything that they ARE good for?”

“True, true—they ARE good for nothing. But what troubles me is the fact that they are dead.”

“What a blockhead of a creature!” said Chichikov to himself, for he was beginning to lose patience. “Bless her heart, I may as well be going. She has thrown me into a perfect sweat, the cursed old shrew!”

He took a handkerchief from his pocket, and wiped the perspiration from his brow. Yet he need not have flown into such a passion. More than one respected statesman reveals himself, when confronted with a business matter, to be just such another as Madam Korobotchka, in that, once he has got an idea into his head, there is no getting it out of him—you may ply him with daylight-clear arguments, yet they will rebound from his brain as an india-rubber ball rebounds from a flagstone. Nevertheless, wiping away the perspiration, Chichikov resolved to try whether he could not bring her back to the road by another path.

“Madam,” he said, “either you are declining to understand what I say or you are talking for the mere sake of talking. If I hand you over some money—fifteen roubles for each soul, do you understand?—it is MONEY, not something which can be picked up haphazard on the street. For instance, tell me how much you sold your honey for?”

“For twelve roubles per pood.”

“Ah! Then by those words, madam, you have laid a trifling sin upon your soul; for you did NOT sell the honey for twelve roubles.”

“By the Lord God I did!”

“Well, well! Never mind. Honey is only honey. Now, you had collected that stuff, it may be, for a year, and with infinite care and labour. You had fussed after it, you had trotted to and fro, you had duly frozen out the bees, and you had fed them in the cellar throughout the winter. But these dead souls of which I speak are quite another matter, for in this case you have put forth no exertions—it was merely God's will that they should leave the world, and thus decrease the personnel of your establishment. In the former case you received (so you allege) twelve roubles per pood for your labour; but in this case you will receive money for having done nothing at all. Nor will you receive twelve roubles per item, but FIFTEEN—and roubles not in silver, but roubles in good paper currency.”

That these powerful inducements would certainly cause the old woman to yield Chichikov had not a doubt.

“True,” his hostess replied. “But how strangely business comes to me as a widow! Perhaps I had better wait a little longer, seeing that other buyers might come along, and I might be able to compare prices.”

“For shame, madam! For shame! Think what you are saying. Who else, I would ask, would care to buy those souls? What use could they be to any one?”

“If that is so, they might come in useful to ME,” mused the old woman aloud; after which she sat staring at Chichikov with her mouth open and a face of nervous expectancy as to his possible rejoinder.

“Dead folk useful in a household!” he exclaimed. “Why, what could you do with them? Set them up on poles to frighten away the sparrows from your garden?”

“The Lord save us, but what things you say!” she ejaculated, crossing herself.

“Well, WHAT could you do with them? By this time they are so much bones and earth. That is all there is left of them. Their transfer to myself would be ON PAPER only. Come, come! At least give me an answer.”

Again the old woman communed with herself.

“What are you thinking of, Nastasia Petrovna?” inquired Chichikov.

“I am thinking that I scarcely know what to do. Perhaps I had better sell you some hemp?”

“What do I want with hemp? Pardon me, but just when I have made to you a different proposal altogether you begin fussing about hemp! Hemp is hemp, and though I may want some when I NEXT visit you, I should like to know what you have to say to the suggestion under discussion.”

“Well, I think it a very queer bargain. Never have I heard of such a thing.”

Upon this Chichikov lost all patience, upset his chair, and bid her go to the devil; of which personage even the mere mention terrified her extremely.

“Do not speak of him, I beg of you!” she cried, turning pale. “May God, rather, bless him! Last night was the third night that he has appeared to me in a dream. You see, after saying my prayers, I bethought me of telling my fortune by the cards; and God must have sent him as a punishment. He looked so horrible, and had horns longer than a bull's!”

“I wonder you don't see SCORES of devils in your dreams! Merely out of Christian charity he had come to you to say, ‘I perceive a poor widow going to rack and ruin, and likely soon to stand in danger of want.’ Well, go to rack and ruin—yes, you and all your village together!”

“The insults!” exclaimed the old woman, glancing at her visitor in terror.

“I should think so!” continued Chichikov. “Indeed, I cannot find words to describe you. To say no more about it, you are like a dog in a manger. You don't want to eat the hay yourself, yet you won't let anyone else touch it. All that I am seeking to do is to purchase certain domestic products of yours, for the reason that I have certain Government contracts to fulfil.” This last he added in passing, and without any ulterior motive, save that it came to him as a happy thought. Nevertheless the mention of Government contracts exercised a powerful influence upon Nastasia Petrovna, and she hastened to say in a tone that was almost supplicatory:

“Why should you be so angry with me? Had I known that you were going to lose your temper in this way, I should never have discussed the matter.”

“No wonder that I lose my temper! An egg too many is no great matter, yet it may prove exceedingly annoying.”

“Well, well, I will let you have the souls for fifteen roubles each. Also, with regard to those contracts, do not forget me if at any time you should find yourself in need of rye-meal or buckwheat or groats or dead meat.”

“No, I shall NEVER forget you, madam!” he said, wiping his forehead, where three separate streams of perspiration were trickling down his face. Then he asked her whether in the town she had any acquaintance or agent whom she could empower to complete the transference of the serfs, and to carry out whatsoever else might be necessary.

“Certainly,” replied Madame Korobotchka. “The son of our archpriest, Father Cyril, himself is a lawyer.”

Upon that Chichikov begged her to accord the gentleman in question a power of attorney, while, to save extra trouble, he himself would then and there compose the requisite letter.

“It would be a fine thing if he were to buy up all my meal and stock for the Government,” thought Madame to herself. “I must encourage him a little. There has been some dough standing ready since last night, so I will go and tell Fetinia to try a few pancakes. Also, it might be well to try him with an egg pie. We make then nicely here, and they do not take long in the making.”

So she departed to translate her thoughts into action, as well as to supplement the pie with other products of the domestic cuisine; while, for his part, Chichikov returned to the drawing-room where he had spent the night, in order to procure from his dispatch-box the necessary writing-paper. The room had now been set in order, the sumptuous feather bed removed, and a table set before the sofa. Depositing his dispatch-box upon the table, he heaved a gentle sigh on becoming aware that he was so soaked with perspiration that he might almost have been dipped in a river. Everything, from his shirt to his socks, was dripping. “May she starve to death, the cursed old harridan!” he ejaculated after a moment's rest. Then he opened his dispatch-box. In passing, I may say that I feel certain that at least SOME of my readers will be curious to know the contents and the internal arrangements of that receptacle. Why should I not gratify their curiosity? To begin with, the centre of the box contained a soap-dish, with, disposed around it, six or seven compartments for razors. Next came square partitions for a sand-box 17 and an inkstand, as well as (scooped out in their midst) a hollow of pens, sealing-wax, and anything else that required more room. Lastly there were all sorts of little divisions, both with and without lids, for articles of a smaller nature, such as visiting cards, memorial cards, theatre tickets, and things which Chichikov had laid by as souvenirs. This portion of the box could be taken out, and below it were both a space for manuscripts and a secret money-box—the latter made to draw out from the side of the receptacle.

Chichikov set to work to clean a pen, and then to write. Presently his hostess entered the room.

“What a beautiful box you have got, my dear sir!” she exclaimed as she took a seat beside him. “Probably you bought it in Moscow?”

“Yes—in Moscow,” replied Chichikov without interrupting his writing.

“I thought so. One CAN get good things there. Three years ago my sister brought me a few pairs of warm shoes for my sons, and they were such excellent articles! To this day my boys wear them. And what nice stamped paper you have!” (she had peered into the dispatch-box, where, sure enough, there lay a further store of the paper in question). “Would you mind letting me have a sheet of it? I am without any at all, although I shall soon have to be presenting a plea to the land court, and possess not a morsel of paper to write it on.”

Upon this Chichikov explained that the paper was not the sort proper for the purpose—that it was meant for serf-indenturing, and not for the framing of pleas. Nevertheless, to quiet her, he gave her a sheet stamped to the value of a rouble. Next, he handed her the letter to sign, and requested, in return, a list of her peasants. Unfortunately, such a list had never been compiled, let alone any copies of it, and the only way in which she knew the peasants' names was by heart. However, he told her to dictate them. Some of the names greatly astonished our hero, so, still more, did the surnames. Indeed, frequently, on hearing the latter, he had to pause before writing them down. Especially did he halt before a certain “Peter Saveliev Nëuvazhai Korito.” “What a string of titles!” involuntarily he ejaculated. To the Christian name of another serf was appended “Korovi Kirpitch,” and to that of a third “Koleso Ivan.” However, at length the list was compiled, and he caught a deep breath; which latter proceeding caused him to catch also the attractive odour of something fried in fat.

“I beseech you to have a morsel,” murmured his hostess. Chichikov looked up, and saw that the table was spread with mushrooms, pies, and other viands.

“Try this freshly-made pie and an egg,” continued Madame.

Chichikov did so, and having eaten more than half of what she offered him, praised the pie highly. Indeed, it was a toothsome dish, and, after his difficulties and exertions with his hostess, it tasted even better than it might otherwise have done.

“And also a few pancakes?” suggested Madame.

For answer Chichikov folded three together, and, having dipped them in melted butter, consigned the lot to his mouth, and then wiped his mouth with a napkin. Twice more was the process repeated, and then he requested his hostess to order the britchka to be got ready. In dispatching Fetinia with the necessary instructions, she ordered her to return with a second batch of hot pancakes.

“Your pancakes are indeed splendid,” said Chichikov, applying himself to the second consignment of fried dainties when they had arrived.

“Yes, we make them well here,” replied Madame. “Yet how unfortunate it is that the harvest should have proved so poor as to have prevented me from earning anything on my—But why should you be in such a hurry to depart, good sir?” She broke off on seeing Chichikov reach for his cap. “The britchka is not yet ready.”

“Then it is being got so, madam, it is being got so, and I shall need a moment or two to pack my things.”

“As you please, dear sir; but do not forget me in connection with those Government contracts.”

“No, I have said that NEVER shall I forget you,” replied Chichikov as he hurried into the hall.

“And would you like to buy some lard?” continued his hostess, pursuing him.

“Lard? Oh certainly. Why not? Only, only—I will do so ANOTHER time.”

“I shall have some ready at about Christmas.”

“Quite so, madam. THEN I will buy anything and everything—the lard included.”

“And perhaps you will be wanting also some feathers? I shall be having some for sale about St. Philip's Day.”

“Very well, very well, madam.”

“There you see!” she remarked as they stepped out on to the verandah. “The britchka is NOT yet ready.”

“But it soon will be, it soon will be. Only direct me to the main road.”

“How am I to do that?” said Madame. “'Twould puzzle a wise man to do so, for in these parts there are so many turnings. However, I will send a girl to guide you. You could find room for her on the box-seat, could you not?”

“Yes, of course.”

“Then I will send her. She knows the way thoroughly. Only do not carry her off for good. Already some traders have deprived me of one of my girls.”

Chichikov reassured his hostess on the point, and Madame plucked up courage enough to scan, first of all, the housekeeper, who happened to be issuing from the storehouse with a bowl of honey, and, next, a young peasant who happened to be standing at the gates; and, while thus engaged, she became wholly absorbed in her domestic pursuits. But why pay her so much attention? The Widow Korobotchka, Madame Manilov, domestic life, non-domestic life—away with them all! How strangely are things compounded! In a trice may joy turn to sorrow, should one halt long enough over it: in a trice only God can say what ideas may strike one. You may fall even to thinking: “After all, did Madame Korobotchka stand so very low in the scale of human perfection? Was there really such a very great gulf between her and Madame Manilov—between her and the Madame Manilov whom we have seen entrenched behind the walls of a genteel mansion in which there were a fine staircase of wrought metal and a number of rich carpets; the Madame Manilov who spent most of her time in yawning behind half-read books, and in hoping for a visit from some socially distinguished person in order that she might display her wit and carefully rehearsed thoughts—thoughts which had been de rigeur in town for a week past, yet which referred, not to what was going on in her household or on her estate—both of which properties were at odds and ends, owing to her ignorance of the art of managing them—but to the coming political revolution in France and the direction in which fashionable Catholicism was supposed to be moving? But away with such things! Why need we speak of them? Yet how comes it that suddenly into the midst of our careless, frivolous, unthinking moments there may enter another, and a very different, tendency?—that the smile may not have left a human face before its owner will have radically changed his or her nature (though not his or her environment) with the result that the face will suddenly become lit with a radiance never before seen there?...”

“Here is the britchka, here is the britchka!” exclaimed Chichikov on perceiving that vehicle slowly advancing. “Ah, you blockhead!” he went on to Selifan. “Why have you been loitering about? I suppose last night's fumes have not yet left your brain?”

To this Selifan returned no reply.

“Good-bye, madam,” added the speaker. “But where is the girl whom you promised me?”

“Here, Pelagea!” called the hostess to a wench of about eleven who was dressed in home-dyed garments and could boast of a pair of bare feet which, from a distance, might almost have been mistaken for boots, so encrusted were they with fresh mire. “Here, Pelagea! Come and show this gentleman the way.”

Selifan helped the girl to ascend to the box-seat. Placing one foot upon the step by which the gentry mounted, she covered the said step with mud, and then, ascending higher, attained the desired position beside the coachman. Chichikov followed in her wake (causing the britchka to heel over with his weight as he did so), and then settled himself back into his place with an “All right! Good-bye, madam!” as the horses moved away at a trot.

Selifan looked gloomy as he drove, but also very attentive to his business. This was invariably his custom when he had committed the fault of getting drunk. Also, the horses looked unusually well-groomed. In particular, the collar on one of them had been neatly mended, although hitherto its state of dilapidation had been such as perennially to allow the stuffing to protrude through the leather. The silence preserved was well-nigh complete. Merely flourishing his whip, Selifan spoke to the team no word of instruction, although the skewbald was as ready as usual to listen to conversation of a didactic nature, seeing that at such times the reins hung loosely in the hands of the loquacious driver, and the whip wandered merely as a matter of form over the backs of the troika. This time, however, there could be heard issuing from Selifan's sullen lips only the uniformly unpleasant exclamation, “Now then, you brutes! Get on with you, get on with you!” The bay and the Assessor too felt put out at not hearing themselves called “my pets” or “good lads”; while, in addition, the skewbald came in for some nasty cuts across his sleek and ample quarters. “What has put master out like this?” thought the animal as it shook its head. “Heaven knows where he does not keep beating me—across the back, and even where I am tenderer still. Yes, he keeps catching the whip in my ears, and lashing me under the belly.”

“To the right, eh?” snapped Selifan to the girl beside him as he pointed to a rain-soaked road which trended away through fresh green fields.

“No, no,” she replied. “I will show you the road when the time comes.”

“Which way, then?” he asked again when they had proceeded a little further.

“This way.” And she pointed to the road just mentioned.

“Get along with you!” retorted the coachman. “That DOES go to the right. You don't know your right hand from your left.”

The weather was fine, but the ground so excessively sodden that the wheels of the britchka collected mire until they had become caked as with a layer of felt, a circumstance which greatly increased the weight of the vehicle, and prevented it from clearing the neighbouring parishes before the afternoon was arrived. Also, without the girl's help the finding of the way would have been impossible, since roads wiggled away in every direction, like crabs released from a net, and, but for the assistance mentioned, Selifan would have found himself left to his own devices. Presently she pointed to a building ahead, with the words, “THERE is the main road.”

“And what is the building?” asked Selifan.

“A tavern,” she said.

“Then we can get along by ourselves,” he observed. “Do you get down, and be off home.”

With that he stopped, and helped her to alight—muttering as he did so: “Ah, you blackfooted creature!”

Chichikov added a copper groat, and she departed well pleased with her ride in the gentleman's carriage.





CHAPTER IV


On reaching the tavern, Chichikov called a halt. His reasons for this were twofold—namely, that he wanted to rest the horses, and that he himself desired some refreshment. In this connection the author feels bound to confess that the appetite and the capacity of such men are greatly to be envied. Of those well-to-do folk of St. Petersburg and Moscow who spend their time in considering what they shall eat on the morrow, and in composing a dinner for the day following, and who never sit down to a meal without first of all injecting a pill and then swallowing oysters and crabs and a quantity of other monsters, while eternally departing for Karlsbad or the Caucasus, the author has but a small opinion. Yes, THEY are not the persons to inspire envy. Rather, it is the folk of the middle classes—folk who at one posthouse call for bacon, and at another for a sucking pig, and at a third for a steak of sturgeon or a baked pudding with onions, and who can sit down to table at any hour, as though they had never had a meal in their lives, and can devour fish of all sorts, and guzzle and chew it with a view to provoking further appetite—these, I say, are the folk who enjoy heaven's most favoured gift. To attain such a celestial condition the great folk of whom I have spoken would sacrifice half their serfs and half their mortgaged and non-mortgaged property, with the foreign and domestic improvements thereon, if thereby they could compass such a stomach as is possessed by the folk of the middle class. But, unfortunately, neither money nor real estate, whether improved or non-improved, can purchase such a stomach.

The little wooden tavern, with its narrow, but hospitable, curtain suspended from a pair of rough-hewn doorposts like old church candlesticks, seemed to invite Chichikov to enter. True, the establishment was only a Russian hut of the ordinary type, but it was a hut of larger dimensions than usual, and had around its windows and gables carved and patterned cornices of bright-coloured wood which threw into relief the darker hue of the walls, and consorted well with the flowered pitchers painted on the shutters.

Ascending the narrow wooden staircase to the upper floor, and arriving upon a broad landing, Chichikov found himself confronted with a creaking door and a stout old woman in a striped print gown. “This way, if you please,” she said. Within the apartment designated Chichikov encountered the old friends which one invariably finds in such roadside hostelries—to wit, a heavy samovar, four smooth, bescratched walls of white pine, a three-cornered press with cups and teapots, egg-cups of gilded china standing in front of ikons suspended by blue and red ribands, a cat lately delivered of a family, a mirror which gives one four eyes instead of two and a pancake for a face, and, beside the ikons, some bunches of herbs and carnations of such faded dustiness that, should one attempt to smell them, one is bound to burst out sneezing.

“Have you a sucking-pig?” Chichikov inquired of the landlady as she stood expectantly before him.

“Yes.”

“And some horse-radish and sour cream?”

“Yes.”

“Then serve them.”

The landlady departed for the purpose, and returned with a plate, a napkin (the latter starched to the consistency of dried bark), a knife with a bone handle beginning to turn yellow, a two-pronged fork as thin as a wafer, and a salt-cellar incapable of being made to stand upright.

Following the accepted custom, our hero entered into conversation with the woman, and inquired whether she herself or a landlord kept the tavern; how much income the tavern brought in; whether her sons lived with her; whether the oldest was a bachelor or married; whom the eldest had taken to wife; whether the dowry had been large; whether the father-in-law had been satisfied, and whether the said father-in-law had not complained of receiving too small a present at the wedding. In short, Chichikov touched on every conceivable point. Likewise (of course) he displayed some curiosity as to the landowners of the neighbourhood. Their names, he ascertained, were Blochin, Potchitaev, Minoi, Cheprakov, and Sobakevitch. “Then you are acquainted with Sobakevitch?” he said; whereupon the old woman informed him that she knew not only Sobakevitch, but also Manilov, and that the latter was the more delicate eater of the two, since, whereas Manilov always ordered a roast fowl and some veal and mutton, and then tasted merely a morsel of each, Sobakevitch would order one dish only, but consume the whole of it, and then demand more at the same price.

Whilst Chichikov was thus conversing and partaking of the sucking pig until only a fragment of it seemed likely to remain, the sound of an approaching vehicle made itself heard. Peering through the window, he saw draw up to the tavern door a light britchka drawn by three fine horses. From it there descended two men—one flaxen-haired and tall, and the other dark-haired and of slighter build. While the flaxen-haired man was clad in a dark-blue coat, the other one was wrapped in a coat of striped pattern. Behind the britchka stood a second, but an empty, turn-out, drawn by four long-coated steeds in ragged collars and rope harnesses. The flaxen-haired man lost no time in ascending the staircase, while his darker friend remained below to fumble at something in the britchka, talking, as he did so, to the driver of the vehicle which stood hitched behind. Somehow, the dark-haired man's voice struck Chichikov as familiar; and as he was taking another look at him the flaxen-haired gentleman entered the room. The newcomer was a man of lofty stature, with a small red moustache and a lean, hard-bitten face whose redness made it evident that its acquaintance, if not with the smoke of gunpowder, at all events with that of tobacco, was intimate and extensive. Nevertheless he greeted Chichikov civilly, and the latter returned his bow. Indeed, the pair would have entered into conversation, and have made one another's acquaintance (since a beginning was made with their simultaneously expressing satisfaction at the circumstance that the previous night's rain had laid the dust on the roads, and thereby made driving cool and pleasant) when the gentleman's darker-favoured friend also entered the room, and, throwing his cap upon the table, pushed back a mass of dishevelled black locks from his brow. The latest arrival was a man of medium height, but well put together, and possessed of a pair of full red cheeks, a set of teeth as white as snow, and coal-black whiskers. Indeed, so fresh was his complexion that it seemed to have been compounded of blood and milk, while health danced in his every feature.

“Ha, ha, ha!” he cried with a gesture of astonishment at the sight of Chichikov. “What chance brings YOU here?”

Upon that Chichikov recognised Nozdrev—the man whom he had met at dinner at the Public Prosecutor's, and who, within a minute or two of the introduction, had become so intimate with his fellow guest as to address him in the second person singular, in spite of the fact that Chichikov had given him no opportunity for doing so.

“Where have you been to-day?” Nozdrev inquired, and, without waiting for an answer, went on: “For myself, I am just from the fair, and completely cleaned out. Actually, I have had to do the journey back with stage horses! Look out of the window, and see them for yourself.” And he turned Chichikov's head so sharply in the desired direction that he came very near to bumping it against the window frame. “Did you ever see such a bag of tricks? The cursed things have only just managed to get here. In fact, on the way I had to transfer myself to this fellow's britchka.” He indicated his companion with a finger.

“By the way, don't you know one another? He is Mizhuev, my brotherin-law. He and I were talking of you only this morning. ‘Just you see,’ said I to him, ‘if we do not fall in with Chichikov before we have done.’ Heavens, how completely cleaned out I am! Not only have I lost four good horses, but also my watch and chain.” Chichikov perceived that in very truth his interlocutor was minus the articles named, as well as that one of Nozdrev's whiskers was less bushy in appearance than the other one. “Had I had another twenty roubles in my pocket,” went on Nozdrev, “I should have won back all that I have lost, as well as have pouched a further thirty thousand. Yes, I give you my word of honour on that.”

“But you were saying the same thing when last I met you,” put in the flaxen-haired man. “Yet, even though I lent you fifty roubles, you lost them all.”

“But I should not have lost them THIS time. Don't try to make me out a fool. I should NOT have lost them, I tell you. Had I only played the right card, I should have broken the bank.”

“But you did NOT break the bank,” remarked the flaxen-haired man.

“No. That was because I did not play my cards right. But what about your precious major's play? Is THAT good?”

“Good or not, at least he beat you.”

“Splendid of him! Nevertheless I will get my own back. Let him play me at doubles, and we shall soon see what sort of a player he is! Friend Chichikov, at first we had a glorious time, for the fair was a tremendous success. Indeed, the tradesmen said that never yet had there been such a gathering. I myself managed to sell everything from my estate at a good price. In fact, we had a magnificent time. I can't help thinking of it, devil take me! But what a pity YOU were not there! Three versts from the town there is quartered a regiment of dragoons, and you would scarcely believe what a lot of officers it has. Forty at least there are, and they do a fine lot of knocking about the town and drinking. In particular, Staff-Captain Potsieluev is a SPLENDID fellow! You should just see his moustache! Why, he calls good claret ‘trash’! ‘Bring me some of the usual trash,’ is his way of ordering it. And Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov, too! He is as delightful as the other man. In fact, I may say that every one of the lot is a rake. I spent my whole time with them, and you can imagine that Ponomarev, the wine merchant, did a fine trade indeed! All the same, he is a rascal, you know, and ought not to be dealt with, for he puts all sorts of rubbish into his liquor—Indian wood and burnt cork and elderberry juice, the villain! Nevertheless, get him to produce a bottle from what he calls his ‘special cellar,’ and you will fancy yourself in the seventh heaven of delight. And what quantities of champagne we drank! Compared with it, provincial stuff is kvass. Try to imagine not merely Clicquot, but a sort of blend of Clicquot and Matradura—Clicquot of double strength. Also Ponomarev produced a bottle of French stuff which he calls ‘Bonbon.’ Had it a bouquet, ask you? Why, it had the bouquet of a rose garden, of anything else you like. What times we had, to be sure! Just after we had left Pnomarev's place, some prince or another arrived in the town, and sent out for some champagne; but not a bottle was there left, for the officers had drunk every one! Why, I myself got through seventeen bottles at a sitting.”

“Come, come! You CAN'T have got through seventeen,” remarked the flaxen-haired man.

“But I did, I give my word of honour,” retorted Nozdrev.

“Imagine what you like, but you didn't drink even TEN bottles at a sitting.”

“Will you bet that I did not?”

“No; for what would be the use of betting about it?”

“Then at least wager the gun which you have bought.”

“No, I am not going to do anything of the kind.”

“Just as an experiment?”

“No.”

“It is as well for you that you don't, since, otherwise, you would have found yourself minus both gun and cap. However, friend Chichikov, it is a pity you were not there. Had you been there, I feel sure you would have found yourself unable to part with Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov. You and he would have hit it off splendidly. You know, he is quite a different sort from the Public Prosecutor and our other provincial skinflints—fellows who shiver in their shoes before they will spend a single kopeck. HE will play faro, or anything else, and at any time. Why did you not come with us, instead of wasting your time on cattle breeding or something of the sort? But never mind. Embrace me. I like you immensely. Mizhuev, see how curiously things have turned out. Chichikov has nothing to do with me, or I with him, yet here is he come from God knows where, and landed in the very spot where I happen to be living! I may tell you that, no matter how many carriages I possessed, I should gamble the lot away. Recently I went in for a turn at billiards, and lost two jars of pomade, a china teapot, and a guitar. Then I staked some more things, and, like a fool, lost them all, and six roubles in addition. What a dog is that Kuvshinnikov! He and I attended nearly every ball in the place. In particular, there was a woman—décolletée, and such a swell! I merely thought to myself, ‘The devil take her!’ but Kuvshinnikov is such a wag that he sat down beside her, and began paying her strings of compliments in French. However, I did not neglect the damsels altogether—although HE calls that sort of thing ‘going in for strawberries.’ By the way, I have a splendid piece of fish and some caviare with me. 'Tis all I HAVE brought back! In fact it is a lucky chance that I happened to buy the stuff before my money was gone. Where are you for?”

“I am about to call on a friend.”

“On what friend? Let him go to the devil, and come to my place instead.”

“I cannot, I cannot. I have business to do.”

“Oh, business again! I thought so!”

“But I HAVE business to do—and pressing business at that.”

“I wager that you're lying. If not, tell me whom you're going to call upon.”

“Upon Sobakevitch.”

Instantly Nozdrev burst into a laugh compassable only by a healthy man in whose head every tooth still remains as white as sugar. By this I mean the laugh of quivering cheeks, the laugh which causes a neighbour who is sleeping behind double doors three rooms away to leap from his bed and exclaim with distended eyes, “Hullo! Something HAS upset him!”

“What is there to laugh at?” asked Chichikov, a trifle nettled; but Nozdrev laughed more unrestrainedly than ever, ejaculating: “Oh, spare us all! The thing is so amusing that I shall die of it!”

“I say that there is nothing to laugh at,” repeated Chichikov. “It is in fulfilment of a promise that I am on my way to Sobakevitch's.”

“Then you will scarcely be glad to be alive when you've got there, for he is the veriest miser in the countryside. Oh, I know you. However, if you think to find there either faro or a bottle of ‘Bonbon’ you are mistaken. Look here, my good friend. Let Sobakevitch go to the devil, and come to MY place, where at least I shall have a piece of sturgeon to offer you for dinner. Ponomarev said to me on parting: ‘This piece is just the thing for you. Even if you were to search the whole market, you would never find a better one.’ But of course he is a terrible rogue. I said to him outright: ‘You and the Collector of Taxes are the two greatest skinflints in the town.’ But he only stroked his beard and smiled. Every day I used to breakfast with Kuvshinnikov in his restaurant. Well, what I was nearly forgetting is this: that, though I am aware that you can't forgo your engagement, I am not going to give you up—no, not for ten thousand roubles of money. I tell you that in advance.”

Here he broke off to run to the window and shout to his servant (who was holding a knife in one hand and a crust of bread and a piece of sturgeon in the other—he had contrived to filch the latter while fumbling in the britchka for something else):

“Hi, Porphyri! Bring here that puppy, you rascal! What a puppy it is! Unfortunately that thief of a landlord has given it nothing to eat, even though I have promised him the roan filly which, as you may remember, I swopped from Khvostirev.” As a matter of act, Chichikov had never in his life seen either Khvostirev or the roan filly.

“Barin, do you wish for anything to eat?” inquired the landlady as she entered.

“No, nothing at all. Ah, friend Chichikov, what times we had! Yes, give me a glass of vodka, old woman. What sort to you keep?”

“Aniseed.”

“Then bring me a glass of it,” repeated Nozdrev.

“And one for me as well,” added the flaxen-haired man.

“At the theatre,” went on Nozdrev, “there was an actress who sang like a canary. Kuvshinnikov, who happened to be sitting with me, said: ‘My boy, you had better go and gather that strawberry.’ As for the booths at the fair, they numbered, I should say, fifty.” At this point he broke off to take the glass of vodka from the landlady, who bowed low in acknowledgement of his doing so. At the same moment Porphyri—a fellow dressed like his master (that is to say, in a greasy, wadded overcoat)—entered with the puppy.

“Put the brute down here,” commanded Nozdrev, “and then fasten it up.”

Porphyri deposited the animal upon the floor; whereupon it proceeded to act after the manner of dogs.

“THERE'S a puppy for you!” cried Nozdrev, catching hold of it by the back, and lifting it up. The puppy uttered a piteous yelp.

“I can see that you haven't done what I told you to do,” he continued to Porphyri after an inspection of the animal's belly. “You have quite forgotten to brush him.”

“I DID brush him,” protested Porphyri.

“Then where did these fleas come from?”

“I cannot think. Perhaps they have leapt into his coat out of the britchka.”

“You liar! As a matter of fact, you have forgotten to brush him. Nevertheless, look at these ears, Chichikov. Just feel them.”

“Why should I? Without doing that, I can see that he is well-bred.”

“Nevertheless, catch hold of his ears and feel them.”

To humour the fellow Chichikov did as he had requested, remarking: “Yes, he seems likely to turn out well.”

“And feel the coldness of his nose! Just take it in your hand.”

Not wishing to offend his interlocutor, Chichikov felt the puppy's nose, saying: “Some day he will have an excellent scent.”

“Yes, will he not? 'Tis the right sort of muzzle for that. I must say that I have long been wanting such a puppy. Porphyri, take him away again.”

Porphyri lifted up the puppy, and bore it downstairs.

“Look here, Chichikov,” resumed Nozdrev. “You MUST come to my place. It lies only five versts away, and we can go there like the wind, and you can visit Sobakevitch afterwards.”

“Shall I, or shall I not, go to Nozdrev's?” reflected Chichikov. “Is he likely to prove any more useful than the rest? Well, at least he is as promising, even though he has lost so much at play. But he has a head on his shoulders, and therefore I must go carefully if I am to tackle him concerning my scheme.”

With that he added aloud: “Very well, I WILL come with you, but do not let us be long, for my time is very precious.”

“That's right, that's right!” cried Nozdrev. “Splendid, splendid! Let me embrace you!” And he fell upon Chichikov's neck. “All three of us will go.”

“No, no,” put in the flaxen-haired man. “You must excuse me, for I must be off home.”

“Rubbish, rubbish! I am NOT going to excuse you.”

“But my wife will be furious with me. You and Monsieur Chichikov must change into the other britchka.”

“Come, come! The thing is not to be thought of.”

The flaxen-haired man was one of those people in whose character, at first sight, there seems to lurk a certain grain of stubbornness—so much so that, almost before one has begun to speak, they are ready to dispute one's words, and to disagree with anything that may be opposed to their peculiar form of opinion. For instance, they will decline to have folly called wisdom, or any tune danced to but their own. Always, however, will there become manifest in their character a soft spot, and in the end they will accept what hitherto they have denied, and call what is foolish sensible, and even dance— yes, better than any one else will do—to a tune set by some one else. In short, they generally begin well, but always end badly.

“Rubbish!” said Nozdrev in answer to a further objection on his brotherin-law's part. And, sure enough, no sooner had Nozdrev clapped his cap upon his head than the flaxen-haired man started to follow him and his companion.

“But the gentleman has not paid for the vodka?” put in the old woman.

“All right, all right, good mother. Look here, brother-in-law. Pay her, will you, for I have not a kopeck left.”

“How much?” inquired the brother-in-law.

“What, sir? Eighty kopecks, if you please,” replied the old woman.

“A lie! Give her half a rouble. That will be quite enough.”

“No, it will NOT, barin,” protested the old woman. However, she took the money gratefully, and even ran to the door to open it for the gentlemen. As a matter of fact, she had lost nothing by the transaction, since she had demanded fully a quarter more than the vodka was worth.

The travellers then took their seats, and since Chichikov's britchka kept alongside the britchka wherein Nozdrev and his brother-in-law were seated, it was possible for all three men to converse together as they proceeded. Behind them came Nozdrev's smaller buggy, with its team of lean stage horses and Porphyri and the puppy. But inasmuch as the conversation which the travellers maintained was not of a kind likely to interest the reader, I might do worse than say something concerning Nozdrev himself, seeing that he is destined to play no small role in our story.

Nozdrev's face will be familiar to the reader, seeing that every one must have encountered many such. Fellows of the kind are known as “gay young sparks,” and, even in their boyhood and school days, earn a reputation for being bons camarades (though with it all they come in for some hard knocks) for the reason that their faces evince an element of frankness, directness, and enterprise which enables them soon to make friends, and, almost before you have had time to look around, to start addressing you in the second person singular. Yet, while cementing such friendships for all eternity, almost always they begin quarrelling the same evening, since, throughout, they are a loquacious, dissipated, high-spirited, over-showy tribe. Indeed, at thirty-five Nozdrev was just what he had been an eighteen and twenty—he was just such a lover of fast living. Nor had his marriage in any way changed him, and the less so since his wife had soon departed to another world, and left behind her two children, whom he did not want, and who were therefore placed in the charge of a good-looking nursemaid. Never at any time could he remain at home for more than a single day, for his keen scent could range over scores and scores of versts, and detect any fair which promised balls and crowds. Consequently in a trice he would be there—quarrelling, and creating disturbances over the gaming-table (like all men of his type, he had a perfect passion for cards) yet playing neither a faultless nor an over-clean game, since he was both a blunderer and able to indulge in a large number of illicit cuts and other devices. The result was that the game often ended in another kind of sport altogether. That is to say, either he received a good kicking, or he had his thick and very handsome whiskers pulled; with the result that on certain occasions he returned home with one of those appendages looking decidedly ragged. Yet his plump, healthy-looking cheeks were so robustly constituted, and contained such an abundance of recreative vigour, that a new whisker soon sprouted in place of the old one, and even surpassed its predecessor. Again (and the following is a phenomenon peculiar to Russia) a very short time would have elapsed before once more he would be consorting with the very cronies who had recently cuffed him—and consorting with them as though nothing whatsoever had happened—no reference to the subject being made by him, and they too holding their tongues.

In short, Nozdrev was, as it were, a man of incident. Never was he present at any gathering without some sort of a fracas occurring thereat. Either he would require to be expelled from the room by gendarmes, or his friends would have to kick him out into the street. At all events, should neither of those occurrences take place, at least he did something of a nature which would not otherwise have been witnessed. That is to say, should he not play the fool in a buffet to such an extent as to make very one smile, you may be sure that he was engaged in lying to a degree which at times abashed even himself. Moreover, the man lied without reason. For instance, he would begin telling a story to the effect that he possessed a blue-coated or a red-coated horse; until, in the end, his listeners would be forced to leave him with the remark, “You are giving us some fine stuff, old fellow!” Also, men like Nozdrev have a passion for insulting their neighbours without the least excuse afforded. (For that matter, even a man of good standing and of respectable exterior—a man with a star on his breast—may unexpectedly press your hand one day, and begin talking to you on subjects of a nature to give food for serious thought. Yet just as unexpectedly may that man start abusing you to your face—and do so in a manner worthy of a collegiate registrar rather than of a man who wears a star on his breast and aspires to converse on subjects which merit reflection. All that one can do in such a case is to stand shrugging one's shoulders in amazement.) Well, Nozdrev had just such a weakness. The more he became friendly with a man, the sooner would he insult him, and be ready to spread calumnies as to his reputation. Yet all the while he would consider himself the insulted one's friend, and, should he meet him again, would greet him in the most amicable style possible, and say, “You rascal, why have you given up coming to see me.” Thus, taken all round, Nozdrev was a person of many aspects and numerous potentialities. In one and the same breath would he propose to go with you whithersoever you might choose (even to the very ends of the world should you so require) or to enter upon any sort of an enterprise with you, or to exchange any commodity for any other commodity which you might care to name. Guns, horses, dogs, all were subjects for barter—though not for profit so far as YOU were concerned. Such traits are mostly the outcome of a boisterous temperament, as is additionally exemplified by the fact that if at a fair he chanced to fall in with a simpleton and to fleece him, he would then proceed to buy a quantity of the very first articles which came to hand—horse-collars, cigar-lighters, dresses for his nursemaid, foals, raisins, silver ewers, lengths of holland, wheatmeal, tobacco, revolvers, dried herrings, pictures, whetstones, crockery, boots, and so forth, until every atom of his money was exhausted. Yet seldom were these articles conveyed home, since, as a rule, the same day saw them lost to some more skilful gambler, in addition to his pipe, his tobacco-pouch, his mouthpiece, his four-horsed turn-out, and his coachman: with the result that, stripped to his very shirt, he would be forced to beg the loan of a vehicle from a friend.

Such was Nozdrev. Some may say that characters of his type have become extinct, that Nozdrevs no longer exist. Alas! such as say this will be wrong; for many a day must pass before the Nozdrevs will have disappeared from our ken. Everywhere they are to be seen in our midst—the only difference between the new and the old being a difference of garments. Persons of superficial observation are apt to consider that a man clad in a different coat is quite a different person from what he used to be.

To continue. The three vehicles bowled up to the steps of Nozdrev's house, and their occupants alighted. But no preparations whatsoever had been made for the guest's reception, for on some wooden trestles in the centre of the dining-room a couple of peasants were engaged in whitewashing the ceiling and drawling out an endless song as they splashed their stuff about the floor. Hastily bidding peasants and trestles to be gone, Nozdrev departed to another room with further instructions. Indeed, so audible was the sound of his voice as he ordered dinner that Chichikov—who was beginning to feel hungry once more—was enabled to gather that it would be at least five o'clock before a meal of any kind would be available. On his return, Nozdrev invited his companions to inspect his establishment—even though as early as two o'clock he had to announce that nothing more was to be seen.

The tour began with a view of the stables, where the party saw two mares (the one a grey, and the other a roan) and a colt; which latter animal, though far from showy, Nozdrev declared to have cost him ten thousand roubles.

“You NEVER paid ten thousand roubles for the brute!” exclaimed the brother-in-law. “He isn't worth even a thousand.”

“By God, I DID pay ten thousand!” asserted Nozdrev.

“You can swear that as much as you like,” retorted the other.

“Will you bet that I did not?” asked Nozdrev, but the brother-in-law declined the offer.

Next, Nozdrev showed his guests some empty stalls where a number of equally fine animals (so he alleged) had lately stood. Also there was on view the goat which an old belief still considers to be an indispensable adjunct to such places, even though its apparent use is to pace up and down beneath the noses of the horses as though the place belonged to it. Thereafter the host took his guests to look at a young wolf which he had got tied to a chain. “He is fed on nothing but raw meat,” he explained, “for I want him to grow up as fierce as possible.” Then the party inspected a pond in which there were “fish of such a size that it would take two men all their time to lift one of them out.”

This piece of information was received with renewed incredulity on the part of the brother-in-law.

“Now, Chichikov,” went on Nozdrev, “let me show you a truly magnificent brace of dogs. The hardness of their muscles will surprise you, and they have jowls as sharp as needles.”

So saying, he led the way to a small, but neatly-built, shed surrounded on every side with a fenced-in run. Entering this run, the visitors beheld a number of dogs of all sorts and sizes and colours. In their midst Nozdrev looked like a father lording it over his family circle. Erecting their tails—their “stems,” as dog fanciers call those members—the animals came bounding to greet the party, and fully a score of them laid their paws upon Chichikov's shoulders. Indeed, one dog was moved with such friendliness that, standing on its hind legs, it licked him on the lips, and so forced him to spit. That done, the visitors duly inspected the couple already mentioned, and expressed astonishment at their muscles. True enough, they were fine animals. Next, the party looked at a Crimean bitch which, though blind and fast nearing her end, had, two years ago, been a truly magnificent dog. At all events, so said Nozdrev. Next came another bitch—also blind; then an inspection of the water-mill, which lacked the spindle-socket wherein the upper stone ought to have been revolving—“fluttering,” to use the Russian peasant's quaint expression. “But never mind,” said Nozdrev. “Let us proceed to the blacksmith's shop.” So to the blacksmith's shop the party proceeded, and when the said shop had been viewed, Nozdrev said as he pointed to a field:

“In this field I have seen such numbers of hares as to render the ground quite invisible. Indeed, on one occasion I, with my own hands, caught a hare by the hind legs.”

“You never caught a hare by the hind legs with your hands!” remarked the brother-in-law.

“But I DID” reiterated Nozdrev. “However, let me show you the boundary where my lands come to an end.”

So saying, he started to conduct his guests across a field which consisted mostly of moleheaps, and in which the party had to pick their way between strips of ploughed land and of harrowed. Soon Chichikov began to feel weary, for the terrain was so low-lying that in many spots water could be heard squelching underfoot, and though for a while the visitors watched their feet, and stepped carefully, they soon perceived that such a course availed them nothing, and took to following their noses, without either selecting or avoiding the spots where the mire happened to be deeper or the reverse. At length, when a considerable distance had been covered, they caught sight of a boundary-post and a narrow ditch.

“That is the boundary,” said Nozdrev. “Everything that you see on this side of the post is mine, as well as the forest on the other side of it, and what lies beyond the forest.”

“WHEN did that forest become yours?” asked the brother-in-law. “It cannot be long since you purchased it, for it never USED to be yours.”

“Yes, it isn't long since I purchased it,” said Nozdrev.

“How long?”

“How long? Why, I purchased it three days ago, and gave a pretty sum for it, as the devil knows!”

“Indeed? Why, three days ago you were at the fair?”

“Wiseacre! Cannot one be at a fair and buy land at the same time? Yes, I WAS at the fair, and my steward bought the land in my absence.”

“Oh, your STEWARD bought it.” The brother-in-law seemed doubtful, and shook his head.

The guests returned by the same route as that by which they had come; whereafter, on reaching the house, Nozdrev conducted them to his study, which contained not a trace of the things usually to be found in such apartments—such things as books and papers. On the contrary, the only articles to be seen were a sword and a brace of guns—the one “of them worth three hundred roubles,” and the other “about eight hundred.” The brotherin-law inspected the articles in question, and then shook his head as before. Next, the visitors were shown some “real Turkish” daggers, of which one bore the inadvertent inscription, “Saveli Sibiriakov, Master Cutler.” Then came a barrel-organ, on which Nozdrev started to play some tune or another. For a while the sounds were not wholly unpleasing, but suddenly something seemed to go wrong, for a mazurka started, to be followed by “Marlborough has gone to the war,” and to this, again, there succeeded an antiquated waltz. Also, long after Nozdrev had ceased to turn the handle, one particularly shrill-pitched pipe which had, throughout, refused to harmonise with the rest kept up a protracted whistling on its own account. Then followed an exhibition of tobacco pipes—pipes of clay, of wood, of meerschaum, pipes smoked and non-smoked; pipes wrapped in chamois leather and not so wrapped; an amber-mounted hookah (a stake won at cards) and a tobacco pouch (worked, it was alleged, by some countess who had fallen in love with Nozdrev at a posthouse, and whose handiwork Nozdrev averred to constitute the “sublimity of superfluity”—a term which, in the Nozdrevian vocabulary, purported to signify the acme of perfection).

Finally, after some hors-d'oeuvres of sturgeon's back, they sat down to table—the time being then nearly five o'clock. But the meal did not constitute by any means the best of which Chichikov had ever partaken, seeing that some of the dishes were overcooked, and others were scarcely cooked at all. Evidently their compounder had trusted chiefly to inspiration—she had laid hold of the first thing which had happened to come to hand. For instance, had pepper represented the nearest article within reach, she had added pepper wholesale. Had a cabbage chanced to be so encountered, she had pressed it also into the service. And the same with milk, bacon, and peas. In short, her rule seemed to have been “Make a hot dish of some sort, and some sort of taste will result.” For the rest, Nozdrev drew heavily upon the wine. Even before the soup had been served, he had poured out for each guest a bumper of port and another of “haut” sauterne. (Never in provincial towns is ordinary, vulgar sauterne even procurable.) Next, he called for a bottle of madeira—“as fine a tipple as ever a field-marshall drank”; but the madeira only burnt the mouth, since the dealers, familiar with the taste of our landed gentry (who love “good” madeira) invariably doctor the stuff with copious dashes of rum and Imperial vodka, in the hope that Russian stomachs will thus be enabled to carry off the lot. After this bottle Nozdrev called for another and “a very special” brand—a brand which he declared to consist of a blend of burgundy and champagne, and of which he poured generous measures into the glasses of Chichikov and the brother-in-law as they sat to right and left of him. But since Chichikov noticed that, after doing so, he added only a scanty modicum of the mixture to his own tumbler, our hero determined to be cautious, and therefore took advantage of a moment when Nozdrev had again plunged into conversation and was yet a third time engaged in refilling his brother-inlaw's glass, to contrive to upset his (Chichikov's) glass over his plate. In time there came also to table a tart of mountain-ashberries—berries which the host declared to equal, in taste, ripe plums, but which, curiously enough, smacked more of corn brandy. Next, the company consumed a sort of pasty of which the precise name has escaped me, but which the host rendered differently even on the second occasion of its being mentioned. The meal over, and the whole tale of wines tried, the guests still retained their seats—a circumstance which embarrassed Chichikov, seeing that he had no mind to propound his pet scheme in the presence of Nozdrev's brother-in-law, who was a complete stranger to him. No, that subject called for amicable and PRIVATE conversation. Nevertheless, the brother-in-law appeared to bode little danger, seeing that he had taken on board a full cargo, and was now engaged in doing nothing of a more menacing nature than picking his nose. At length he himself noticed that he was not altogether in a responsible condition; wherefore he rose and began to make excuses for departing homewards, though in a tone so drowsy and lethargic that, to quote the Russian proverb, he might almost have been “pulling a collar on to a horse by the clasps.”

“No, no!” cried Nozdrev. “I am NOT going to let you go.”

“But I MUST go,” replied the brother-in-law. “Don't dry to hinder me. You are annoying me greatly.”

“Rubbish! We are going to play a game of banker.”

“No, no. You must play it without me, my friend. My wife is expecting me at home, and I must go and tell her all about the fair. Yes, I MUST go if I am to please her. Do not try to detain me.”

“Your wife be—! But have you REALLY an important piece of business with her?”

“No, no, my friend. The real reason is that she is a good and trustful woman, and that she does a great deal for me. The tears spring to my eyes as I think of it. Do not detain me. As an honourable man I say that I must go. Of that I do assure you in all sincerity.”

“Oh, let him go,” put in Chichikov under his breath. “What use will he be here?”

“Very well,” said Nozdrev, “though, damn it, I do not like fellows who lose their heads.” Then he added to his brother-in-law: “All right, Thetuk . Off you go to your wife and your woman's talk and may the devil go with you!”

“Do not insult me with the term Thetuk,” retorted the brother-in-law. “To her I owe my life, and she is a dear, good woman, and has shown me much affection. At the very thought of it I could weep. You see, she will be asking me what I have seen at the fair, and tell her about it I must, for she is such a dear, good woman.”

“Then off you go to her with your pack of lies. Here is your cap.”

“No, good friend, you are not to speak of her like that. By so doing you offend me greatly—I say that she is a dear, good woman.”

“Then run along home to her.”

“Yes, I am just going. Excuse me for having been unable to stay. Gladly would I have stayed, but really I cannot.”

The brother-in-law repeated his excuses again and again without noticing that he had entered the britchka, that it had passed through the gates, and that he was now in the open country. Permissibly we may suppose that his wife succeeded in gleaning from him few details of the fair.

“What a fool!” said Nozdrev as, standing by the window, he watched the departing vehicle. “Yet his off-horse is not such a bad one. For a long time past I have been wanting to get hold of it. A man like that is simply impossible. Yes, he is a Thetuk, a regular Thetuk.”

With that they repaired to the parlour, where, on Porphyri bringing candles, Chichikov perceived that his host had produced a pack of cards.

“I tell you what,” said Nozdrev, pressing the sides of the pack together, and then slightly bending them, so that the pack cracked and a card flew out. “How would it be if, to pass the time, I were to make a bank of three hundred?”

Chichikov pretended not to have heard him, but remarked with an air of having just recollected a forgotten point:

“By the way, I had omitted to say that I have a request to make of you.”

“What request?”

“First give me your word that you will grant it.”

“What is the request, I say?”

“Then you give me your word, do you?”

“Certainly.”

“Your word of honour?”

“My word of honour.”

“This, then, is my request. I presume that you have a large number of dead serfs whose names have not yet been removed from the revision list?”

“I have. But why do you ask?”

“Because I want you to make them over to me.”

“Of what use would they be to you?”

“Never mind. I have a purpose in wanting them.”

“What purpose?”

“A purpose which is strictly my own affair. In short, I need them.”

“You seem to have hatched a very fine scheme. Out with it, now! What is in the wind?”

“How could I have hatched such a scheme as you say? One could not very well hatch a scheme out of such a trifle as this.”

“Then for what purpose do you want the serfs?”

“Oh, the curiosity of the man! He wants to poke his fingers into and smell over every detail!”

“Why do you decline to say what is in your mind? At all events, until you DO say I shall not move in the matter.”

“But how would it benefit you to know what my plans are? A whim has seized me. That is all. Nor are you playing fair. You have given me your word of honour, yet now you are trying to back out of it.”

“No matter what you desire me to do, I decline to do it until you have told me your purpose.”

“What am I to say to the fellow?” thought Chichikov. He reflected for a moment, and then explained that he wanted the dead souls in order to acquire a better standing in society, since at present he possessed little landed property, and only a handful of serfs.

“You are lying,” said Nozdrev without even letting him finish. “Yes, you are lying my good friend.”

Chichikov himself perceived that his device had been a clumsy one, and his pretext weak. “I must tell him straight out,” he said to himself as he pulled his wits together.

“Should I tell you the truth,” he added aloud, “I must beg of you not to repeat it. The truth is that I am thinking of getting married. But, unfortunately, my betrothed's father and mother are very ambitious people, and do not want me to marry her, since they desire the bridegroom to own not less than three hundred souls, whereas I own but a hundred and fifty, and that number is not sufficient.”

“Again you are lying,” said Nozdrev.

“Then look here; I have been lying only to this extent.” And Chichikov marked off upon his little finger a minute portion.

“Nevertheless I will bet my head that you have been lying throughout.”

“Come, come! That is not very civil of you. Why should I have been lying?”

“Because I know you, and know that you are a regular skinflint. I say that in all friendship. If I possessed any power over you I should hang you to the nearest tree.”

This remark hurt Chichikov, for at any time he disliked expressions gross or offensive to decency, and never allowed any one—no, not even persons of the highest rank—to behave towards him with an undue measure of familiarity. Consequently his sense of umbrage on the present occasion was unbounded.

“By God, I WOULD hang you!” repeated Nozdrev. “I say this frankly, and not for the purpose of offending you, but simply to communicate to you my friendly opinion.”

“To everything there are limits,” retorted Chichikov stiffly. “If you want to indulge in speeches of that sort you had better return to the barracks.”

However, after a pause he added:

“If you do not care to give me the serfs, why not SELL them?”

“SELL them? I know you, you rascal! You wouldn't give me very much for them, WOULD you?”

“A nice fellow! Look here. What are they to you? So many diamonds, eh?”

“I thought so! I know you!”

“Pardon me, but I could wish that you were a member of the Jewish persuasion. You would give them to me fast enough then.”

“On the contrary, to show you that I am not a usurer, I will decline to ask of you a single kopeck for the serfs. All that you need do is to buy that colt of mine, and then I will throw in the serfs in addition.”

“But what should I want with your colt?” said Chichikov, genuinely astonished at the proposal.

“What should YOU want with him? Why, I have bought him for ten thousand roubles, and am ready to let you have him for four.”

“I ask you again: of what use could the colt possibly be to me? I am not the keeper of a breeding establishment.”

“Ah! I see that you fail to understand me. Let me suggest that you pay down at once three thousand roubles of the purchase money, and leave the other thousand until later.”

“But I do not mean to buy the colt, damn him!”

“Then buy the roan mare.”

“No, nor the roan mare.”

“Then you shall have both the mare and the grey horse which you have seen in my stables for two thousand roubles.”

“I require no horses at all.”

“But you would be able to sell them again. You would be able to get thrice their purchase price at the very first fair that was held.”

“Then sell them at that fair yourself, seeing that you are so certain of making a triple profit.” “Oh, I should make it fast enough, only I want YOU to benefit by the transaction.”

Chichikov duly thanked his interlocutor, but continued to decline either the grey horse or the roan mare.

“Then buy a few dogs,” said Nozdrev. “I can sell you a couple of hides a-quiver, ears well pricked, coats like quills, ribs barrel-shaped, and paws so tucked up as scarcely to graze the ground when they run.”

“Of what use would those dogs be to me? I am not a sportsman.”

“But I WANT you to have the dogs. Listen. If you won't have the dogs, then buy my barrel-organ. 'Tis a splendid instrument. As a man of honour I can tell you that, when new, it cost me fifteen hundred roubles. Well, you shall have it for nine hundred.”

“Come, come! What should I want with a barrel-organ? I am not a German, to go hauling it about the roads and begging for coppers.”

“But this is quite a different kind of organ from the one which Germans take about with them. You see, it is a REAL organ. Look at it for yourself. It is made of the best wood. I will take you to have another view of it.”

And seizing Chichikov by the hand, Nozdrev drew him towards the other room, where, in spite of the fact that Chichikov, with his feet planted firmly on the floor, assured his host, again and again, that he knew exactly what the organ was like, he was forced once more to hear how Marlborough went to the war.

“Then, since you don't care to give me any money for it,” persisted Nozdrev, “listen to the following proposal. I will give you the barrel-organ and all the dead souls which I possess, and in return you shall give me your britchka, and another three hundred roubles into the bargain.”

“Listen to the man! In that case, what should I have left to drive in?”

“Oh, I would stand you another britchka. Come to the coach-house, and I will show you the one I mean. It only needs repainting to look a perfectly splendid britchka.”

“The ramping, incorrigible devil!” thought Chichikov to himself as at all hazards he resolved to escape from britchkas, organs, and every species of dog, however marvellously barrel-ribbed and tucked up of paw.

“And in exchange, you shall have the britchka, the barrel-organ, and the dead souls,” repeated Nozdrev.

“I must decline the offer,” said Chichikov.

“And why?”

“Because I don't WANT the things—I am full up already.”

“I can see that you don't know how things should be done between good friends and comrades. Plainly you are a man of two faces.”

“What do you mean, you fool? Think for yourself. Why should I acquire articles which I don't want?”

“Say no more about it, if you please. I have quite taken your measure. But see here. Should you care to play a game of banker? I am ready to stake both the dead souls and the barrel-organ at cards.”

“No; to leave an issue to cards means to submit oneself to the unknown,” said Chichikov, covertly glancing at the pack which Nozdrev had got in his hands. Somehow the way in which his companion had cut that pack seemed to him suspicious.

“Why ‘to the unknown’?” asked Nozdrev. “There is no such thing as ‘the unknown.’ Should luck be on your side, you may win the devil knows what a haul. Oh, luck, luck!” he went on, beginning to deal, in the hope of raising a quarrel. “Here is the cursed nine upon which, the other night, I lost everything. All along I knew that I should lose my money. Said I to myself: ‘The devil take you, you false, accursed card!’”

Just as Nozdrev uttered the words Porphyri entered with a fresh bottle of liquor; but Chichikov declined either to play or to drink.

“Why do you refuse to play?” asked Nozdrev.

“Because I feel indisposed to do so. Moreover, I must confess that I am no great hand at cards.”

“WHY are you no great hand at them?”

Chichikov shrugged his shoulders. “Because I am not,” he replied.

“You are no great hand at ANYTHING, I think.”

“What does that matter? God has made me so.”

“The truth is that you are a Thetuk, and nothing else. Once upon a time I believed you to be a good fellow, but now I see that you don't understand civility. One cannot speak to you as one would to an intimate, for there is no frankness or sincerity about you. You are a regular Sobakevitch—just such another as he.”

“For what reason are you abusing me? Am I in any way at fault for declining to play cards? Sell me those souls if you are the man to hesitate over such rubbish.”

“The foul fiend take you! I was about to have given them to you for nothing, but now you shan't have them at all—not if you offer me three kingdoms in exchange. Henceforth I will have nothing to do with you, you cobbler, you dirty blacksmith! Porphyri, go and tell the ostler to give the gentleman's horses no oats, but only hay.”

This development Chichikov had hardly expected.

“And do you,” added Nozdrev to his guest, “get out of my sight.”

Yet in spite of this, host and guest took supper together—even though on this occasion the table was adorned with no wines of fictitious nomenclature, but only with a bottle which reared its solitary head beside a jug of what is usually known as vin ordinaire. When supper was over Nozdrev said to Chichikov as he conducted him to a side room where a bed had been made up:

“This is where you are to sleep. I cannot very well wish you good-night.”

Left to himself on Nozdrev's departure, Chichikov felt in a most unenviable frame of mind. Full of inward vexation, he blamed himself bitterly for having come to see this man and so wasted valuable time; but even more did he blame himself for having told him of his scheme—for having acted as carelessly as a child or a madman. Of a surety the scheme was not one which ought to have been confided to a man like Nozdrev, for he was a worthless fellow who might lie about it, and append additions to it, and spread such stories as would give rise to God knows what scandals. “This is indeed bad!” Chichikov said to himself. “I have been an absolute fool.” Consequently he spent an uneasy night—this uneasiness being increased by the fact that a number of small, but vigorous, insects so feasted upon him that he could do nothing but scratch the spots and exclaim, “The devil take you and Nozdrev alike!” Only when morning was approaching did he fall asleep. On rising, he made it his first business (after donning dressing-gown and slippers) to cross the courtyard to the stable, for the purpose of ordering Selifan to harness the britchka. Just as he was returning from his errand he encountered Nozdrev, clad in a dressing-gown, and holding a pipe between his teeth.

Host and guest greeted one another in friendly fashion, and Nozdrev inquired how Chichikov had slept.

“Fairly well,” replied Chichikov, but with a touch of dryness in his tone.

“The same with myself,” said Nozdrev. “The truth is that such a lot of nasty brutes kept crawling over me that even to speak of it gives me the shudders. Likewise, as the effect of last night's doings, a whole squadron of soldiers seemed to be camping on my chest, and giving me a flogging. Ugh! And whom also do you think I saw in a dream? You would never guess. Why, it was Staff-Captain Potsieluev and Lieutenant Kuvshinnikov!”

“Yes,” though Chichikov to himself, “and I wish that they too would give you a public thrashing!”

“I felt so ill!” went on Nozdrev. “And just after I had fallen asleep something DID come and sting me. Probably it was a party of hag fleas. Now, dress yourself, and I will be with you presently. First of all I must give that scoundrel of a bailiff a wigging.”

Chichikov departed to his own room to wash and dress; which process completed, he entered the dining-room to find the table laid with tea-things and a bottle of rum. Clearly no broom had yet touched the place, for there remained traces of the previous night's dinner and supper in the shape of crumbs thrown over the floor and tobacco ash on the tablecloth. The host himself, when he entered, was still clad in a dressing-gown exposing a hairy chest; and as he sat holding his pipe in his hand, and drinking tea from a cup, he would have made a model for the sort of painter who prefers to portray gentlemen of the less curled and scented order.

“What think you?” he asked of Chichikov after a short silence. “Are you willing NOW to play me for those souls?”

“I have told you that I never play cards. If the souls are for sale, I will buy them.”

“I decline to sell them. Such would not be the course proper between friends. But a game of banker would be quite another matter. Let us deal the cards.”

“I have told you that I decline to play.”

“And you will not agree to an exchange?”

“No.”

“Then look here. Suppose we play a game of chess. If you win, the souls shall be yours. There are lot which I should like to see crossed off the revision list. Hi, Porphyri! Bring me the chessboard.”

“You are wasting your time. I will play neither chess nor cards.”

“But chess is different from playing with a bank. In chess there can be neither luck nor cheating, for everything depends upon skill. In fact, I warn you that I cannot possibly play with you unless you allow me a move or two in advance.”

“The same with me,” thought Chichikov. “Shall I, or shall I not, play this fellow? I used not to be a bad chess-player, and it is a sport in which he would find it more difficult to be up to his tricks.”

“Very well,” he added aloud. “I WILL play you at chess.”

“And stake the souls for a hundred roubles?” asked Nozdrev. “No. Why for a hundred? Would it not be sufficient to stake them for fifty?”

“No. What would be the use of fifty? Nevertheless, for the hundred roubles I will throw in a moderately old puppy, or else a gold seal and watch-chain.”

“Very well,” assented Chichikov.

“Then how many moves are you going to allow me?”

“Is THAT to be part of the bargain? Why, none, of course.”

“At least allow me two.”

“No, none. I myself am only a poor player.”

“I know you and your poor play,” said Nozdrev, moving a chessman.

“In fact, it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my hand,” replied Chichikov, also moving a piece.

“Ah! I know you and your poor play,” repeated Nozdrev, moving a second chessman.

“I say again that it is a long time since last I had a chessman in my hand.” And Chichikov, in his turn, moved.

“Ah! I know you and your poor play,” repeated Nozdrev, for the third time as he made a third move. At the same moment the cuff of one of his sleeves happened to dislodge another chessman from its position.

“Again, I say,” said Chichikov, “that 'Tis a long time since last—But hi! look here! Put that piece back in its place!”

“What piece?”

“This one.” And almost as Chichikov spoke he saw a third chessman coming into view between the queens. God only knows whence that chessman had materialised.

“No, no!” shouted Chichikov as he rose from the table. “It is impossible to play with a man like you. People don't move three pieces at once.”

“How ‘three pieces’? All that I have done is to make a mistake—to move one of my pieces by accident. If you like, I will forfeit it to you.”

“And whence has the third piece come?”

“What third piece?”

“The one now standing between the queens?”

“'Tis one of your own pieces. Surely you are forgetting?”

“No, no, my friend. I have counted every move, and can remember each one. That piece has only just become added to the board. Put it back in its place, I say.”

“Its place? Which IS its place?” But Nozdrev had reddened a good deal. “I perceive you to be a strategist at the game.”

“No, no, good friend. YOU are the strategist—though an unsuccessful one, as it happens.”

“Then of what are you supposing me capable? Of cheating you?”

“I am not supposing you capable of anything. All that I say is that I will not play with you any more.”

“But you can't refuse to,” said Nozdrev, growing heated. “You see, the game has begun.”

“Nevertheless, I have a right not to continue it, seeing that you are not playing as an honest man should do.”

“You are lying—you cannot truthfully say that.”

“'Tis you who are lying.”

“But I have NOT cheated. Consequently you cannot refuse to play, but must continue the game to a finish.”

“You cannot force me to play,” retorted Chichikov coldly as, turning to the chessboard, he swept the pieces into confusion.

Nozdrev approached Chichikov with a manner so threatening that the other fell back a couple of paces.

“I WILL force you to play,” said Nozdrev. “It is no use you making a mess of the chessboard, for I can remember every move. We will replace the chessmen exactly as they were.”

“No, no, my friend. The game is over, and I play you no more.”

“You say that you will not?”

“Yes. Surely you can see for yourself that such a thing is impossible?”

“That cock won't fight. Say at once that you refuse to play with me.” And Nozdrev approached a step nearer.

“Very well; I DO say that,” replied Chichikov, and at the same moment raised his hands towards his face, for the dispute was growing heated. Nor was the act of caution altogether unwarranted, for Nozdrev also raised his fist, and it may be that one of her hero's plump, pleasant-looking cheeks would have sustained an indelible insult had not he (Chichikov) parried the blow and, seizing Nozdrev by his whirling arms, held them fast.

“Porphyri! Pavlushka!” shouted Nozdrev as madly he strove to free himself.

On hearing the words, Chichikov, both because he wished to avoid rendering the servants witnesses of the unedifying scene and because he felt that it would be of no avail to hold Nozdrev any longer, let go of the latter's arms; but at the same moment Porphyri and Pavlushka entered the room—a pair of stout rascals with whom it would be unwise to meddle.

“Do you, or do you not, intend to finish the game?” said Nozdrev. “Give me a direct answer.”

“No; it will not be possible to finish the game,” replied Chichikov, glancing out of the window. He could see his britchka standing ready for him, and Selifan evidently awaiting orders to draw up to the entrance steps. But from the room there was no escape, since in the doorway was posted the couple of well-built serving-men.

“Then it is as I say? You refuse to finish the game?” repeated Nozdrev, his face as red as fire.

“I would have finished it had you played like a man of honour. But, as it is, I cannot.”

“You cannot, eh, you villain? You find that you cannot as soon as you find that you are not winning? Thrash him, you fellows!” And as he spoke Nozdrev grasped the cherrywood shank of his pipe. Chichikov turned as white as a sheet. He tried to say something, but his quivering lips emitted no sound. “Thrash him!” again shouted Nozdrev as he rushed forward in a state of heat and perspiration more proper to a warrior who is attacking an impregnable fortress. “Thrash him!” again he shouted in a voice like that of some half-demented lieutenant whose desperate bravery has acquired such a reputation that orders have had to be issued that his hands shall be held lest he attempt deeds of over-presumptuous daring. Seized with the military spirit, however, the lieutenant's head begins to whirl, and before his eye there flits the image of Suvorov. He advances to the great encounter, and impulsively cries, “Forward, my sons!”—cries it without reflecting that he may be spoiling the plan of the general attack, that millions of rifles may be protruding their muzzles through the embrasures of the impregnable, towering walls of the fortress, that his own impotent assault may be destined to be dissipated like dust before the wind, and that already there may have been launched on its whistling career the bullet which is to close for ever his vociferous throat. However, if Nozdrev resembled the headstrong, desperate lieutenant whom we have just pictured as advancing upon a fortress, at least the fortress itself in no way resembled the impregnable stronghold which I have described. As a matter of fact, the fortress became seized with a panic which drove its spirit into its boots. First of all, the chair with which Chichikov (the fortress in question) sought to defend himself was wrested from his grasp by the serfs, and then—blinking and neither alive nor dead—he turned to parry the Circassian pipe-stem of his host. In fact, God only knows what would have happened had not the fates been pleased by a miracle to deliver Chichikov's elegant back and shoulders from the onslaught. Suddenly, and as unexpectedly as though the sound had come from the clouds, there made itself heard the tinkling notes of a collar-bell, and then the rumble of wheels approaching the entrance steps, and, lastly, the snorting and hard breathing of a team of horses as a vehicle came to a standstill. Involuntarily all present glanced through the window, and saw a man clad in a semi-military greatcoat leap from a buggy. After making an inquiry or two in the hall, he entered the dining-room just at the juncture when Chichikov, almost swooning with terror, had found himself placed in about as awkward a situation as could well befall a mortal man.

“Kindly tell me which of you is Monsieur Nozdrev?” said the unknown with a glance of perplexity both at the person named (who was still standing with pipe-shank upraised) and at Chichikov (who was just beginning to recover from his unpleasant predicament).

“Kindly tell ME whom I have the honour of addressing?” retorted Nozdrev as he approached the official.

“I am the Superintendent of Rural Police.”

“And what do you want?”

“I have come to fulfil a commission imposed upon me. That is to say, I have come to place you under arrest until your case shall have been decided.”

“Rubbish! What case, pray?”

“The case in which you involved yourself when, in a drunken condition, and through the instrumentality of a walking-stick, you offered grave offence to the person of Landowner Maksimov.”

“You lie! To your face I tell you that never in my life have I set eyes upon Landowner Maksimov.”

“Good sir, allow me to represent to you that I am a Government officer. Speeches like that you may address to your servants, but not to me.”

At this point Chichikov, without waiting for Nozdrev's reply, seized his cap, slipped behind the Superintendent's back, rushed out on to the verandah, sprang into his britchka, and ordered Selifan to drive like the wind.





CHAPTER V


Certainly Chichikov was a thorough coward, for, although the britchka pursued its headlong course until Nozdrev's establishment had disappeared behind hillocks and hedgerows, our hero continued to glance nervously behind him, as though every moment expecting to see a stern chase begin. His breath came with difficulty, and when he tried his heart with his hands he could feel it fluttering like a quail caught in a net. “What a sweat the fellow has thrown me into!” he thought to himself, while many a dire and forceful aspiration passed through his mind. Indeed, the expressions to which he gave vent were most inelegant in their nature. But what was to be done next? He was a Russian and thoroughly aroused. The affair had been no joke. “But for the Superintendent,” he reflected, “I might never again have looked upon God's daylight—I might have vanished like a bubble on a pool, and left neither trace nor posterity nor property nor an honourable name for my future offspring to inherit!” (it seemed that our hero was particularly anxious with regard to his possible issue).

“What a scurvy barin!” mused Selifan as he drove along. “Never have I seen such a barin. I should like to spit in his face. 'Tis better to allow a man nothing to eat than to refuse to feed a horse properly. A horse needs his oats—they are his proper fare. Even if you make a man procure a meal at his own expense, don't deny a horse his oats, for he ought always to have them.”

An equally poor opinion of Nozdrev seemed to be cherished also by the steeds, for not only were the bay and the Assessor clearly out of spirits, but even the skewbald was wearing a dejected air. True, at home the skewbald got none but the poorer sorts of oats to eat, and Selifan never filled his trough without having first called him a villain; but at least they WERE oats, and not hay—they were stuff which could be chewed with a certain amount of relish. Also, there was the fact that at intervals he could intrude his long nose into his companions' troughs (especially when Selifan happened to be absent from the stable) and ascertain what THEIR provender was like. But at Nozdrev's there had been nothing but hay! That was not right. All three horses felt greatly discontented.

But presently the malcontents had their reflections cut short in a very rude and unexpected manner. That is to say, they were brought back to practicalities by coming into violent collision with a six-horsed vehicle, while upon their heads descended both a babel of cries from the ladies inside and a storm of curses and abuse from the coachman. “Ah, you damned fool!” he vociferated. “I shouted to you loud enough! Draw out, you old raven, and keep to the right! Are you drunk?” Selifan himself felt conscious that he had been careless, but since a Russian does not care to admit a fault in the presence of strangers, he retorted with dignity: “Why have you run into US? Did you leave your eyes behind you at the last tavern that you stopped at?” With that he started to back the britchka, in the hope that it might get clear of the other's harness; but this would not do, for the pair were too hopelessly intertwined. Meanwhile the skewbald snuffed curiously at his new acquaintances as they stood planted on either side of him; while the ladies in the vehicle regarded the scene with an expression of terror. One of them was an old woman, and the other a damsel of about sixteen. A mass of golden hair fell daintily from a small head, and the oval of her comely face was as shapely as an egg, and white with the transparent whiteness seen when the hands of a housewife hold a new-laid egg to the light to let the sun's rays filter through its shell. The same tint marked the maiden's ears where they glowed in the sunshine, and, in short, what with the tears in her wide-open, arresting eyes, she presented so attractive a picture that our hero bestowed upon it more than a passing glance before he turned his attention to the hubbub which was being raised among the horses and the coachmen.

“Back out, you rook of Nizhni Novgorod!” the strangers' coachman shouted. Selifan tightened his reins, and the other driver did the same. The horses stepped back a little, and then came together again—this time getting a leg or two over the traces. In fact, so pleased did the skewbald seem with his new friends that he refused to stir from the melee into which an unforeseen chance had plunged him. Laying his muzzle lovingly upon the neck of one of his recently-acquired acquaintances, he seemed to be whispering something in that acquaintance's ear—and whispering pretty nonsense, too, to judge from the way in which that confidant kept shaking his ears. At length peasants from a village which happened to be near the scene of the accident tackled the mess; and since a spectacle of that kind is to the Russian muzhik what a newspaper or a club-meeting is to the German, the vehicles soon became the centre of a crowd, and the village denuded even of its old women and children. The traces were disentangled, and a few slaps on the nose forced the skewbald to draw back a little; after which the teams were straightened out and separated. Nevertheless, either sheer obstinacy or vexation at being parted from their new friends caused the strange team absolutely to refuse to move a leg. Their driver laid the whip about them, but still they stood as though rooted to the spot. At length the participatory efforts of the peasants rose to an unprecedented degree of enthusiasm, and they shouted in an intermittent chorus the advice, “Do you, Andrusha, take the head of the trace horse on the right, while Uncle Mitai mounts the shaft horse. Get up, Uncle Mitai.” Upon that the lean, long, and red-bearded Uncle Mitai mounted the shaft horse; in which position he looked like a village steeple or the winder which is used to raise water from wells. The coachman whipped up his steeds afresh, but nothing came of it, and Uncle Mitai had proved useless. “Hold on, hold on!” shouted the peasants again. “Do you, Uncle Mitai, mount the trace horse, while Uncle Minai mounts the shaft horse.” Whereupon Uncle Minai—a peasant with a pair of broad shoulders, a beard as black as charcoal, and a belly like the huge samovar in which sbiten is brewed for all attending a local market—hastened to seat himself upon the shaft horse, which almost sank to the ground beneath his weight. “NOW they will go all right!” the muzhiks exclaimed. “Lay it on hot, lay it on hot! Give that sorrel horse the whip, and make him squirm like a koramora .” Nevertheless, the affair in no way progressed; wherefore, seeing that flogging was of no use, Uncles Mitai and Minai BOTH mounted the sorrel, while Andrusha seated himself upon the trace horse. Then the coachman himself lost patience, and sent the two Uncles about their business—and not before it was time, seeing that the horses were steaming in a way that made it clear that, unless they were first winded, they would never reach the next posthouse. So they were given a moment's rest. That done, they moved off of their own accord!

Throughout, Chichikov had been gazing at the young unknown with great attention, and had even made one or two attempts to enter into conversation with her: but without success. Indeed, when the ladies departed, it was as in a dream that he saw the girl's comely presence, the delicate features of her face, and the slender outline of her form vanish from his sight; it was as in a dream that once more he saw only the road, the britchka, the three horses, Selifan, and the bare, empty fields. Everywhere in life—yes, even in the plainest, the dingiest ranks of society, as much as in those which are uniformly bright and presentable—a man may happen upon some phenomenon which is so entirely different from those which have hitherto fallen to his lot. Everywhere through the web of sorrow of which our lives are woven there may suddenly break a clear, radiant thread of joy; even as suddenly along the street of some poor, poverty-stricken village which, ordinarily, sees nought but a farm waggon there may came bowling a gorgeous coach with plated harness, picturesque horses, and a glitter of glass, so that the peasants stand gaping, and do not resume their caps until long after the strange equipage has become lost to sight. Thus the golden-haired maiden makes a sudden, unexpected appearance in our story, and as suddenly, as unexpectedly, disappears. Indeed, had it not been that the person concerned was Chichikov, and not some youth of twenty summers—a hussar or a student or, in general, a man standing on the threshold of life—what thoughts would not have sprung to birth, and stirred and spoken, within him; for what a length of time would he not have stood entranced as he stared into the distance and forgot alike his journey, the business still to be done, the possibility of incurring loss through lingering—himself, his vocation, the world, and everything else that the world contains!

But in the present case the hero was a man of middle-age, and of cautious and frigid temperament. True, he pondered over the incident, but in more deliberate fashion than a younger man would have done. That is to say, his reflections were not so irresponsible and unsteady. “She was a comely damsel,” he said to himself as he opened his snuff-box and took a pinch. “But the important point is: Is she also a NICE DAMSEL? One thing she has in her favour—and that is that she appears only just to have left school, and not to have had time to become womanly in the worser sense. At present, therefore, she is like a child. Everything in her is simple, and she says just what she thinks, and laughs merely when she feels inclined. Such a damsel might be made into anything—or she might be turned into worthless rubbish. The latter, I surmise, for trudging after her she will have a fond mother and a bevy of aunts, and so forth—persons who, within a year, will have filled her with womanishness to the point where her own father wouldn't know her. And to that there will be added pride and affectation, and she will begin to observe established rules, and to rack her brains as to how, and how much, she ought to talk, and to whom, and where, and so forth. Every moment will see her growing timorous and confused lest she be saying too much. Finally, she will develop into a confirmed prevaricator, and end by marrying the devil knows whom!” Chichikov paused awhile. Then he went on: “Yet I should like to know who she is, and who her father is, and whether he is a rich landowner of good standing, or merely a respectable man who has acquired a fortune in the service of the Government. Should he allow her, on marriage, a dowry of, say, two hundred thousand roubles, she will be a very nice catch indeed. She might even, so to speak, make a man of good breeding happy.”

Indeed, so attractively did the idea of the two hundred thousand roubles begin to dance before his imagination that he felt a twinge of self-reproach because, during the hubbub, he had not inquired of the postillion or the coachman who the travellers might be. But soon the sight of Sobakevitch's country house dissipated his thoughts, and forced him to return to his stock subject of reflection.

Sobakevitch's country house and estate were of very fair size, and on each side of the mansion were expanses of birch and pine forest in two shades of green. The wooden edifice itself had dark-grey walls and a red-gabled roof, for it was a mansion of the kind which Russia builds for her military settlers and for German colonists. A noticeable circumstance was the fact that the taste of the architect had differed from that of the proprietor—the former having manifestly been a pedant and desirous of symmetry, and the latter having wished only for comfort. Consequently he (the proprietor) had dispensed with all windows on one side of the mansion, and had caused to be inserted, in their place, only a small aperture which, doubtless, was intended to light an otherwise dark lumber-room. Likewise, the architect's best efforts had failed to cause the pediment to stand in the centre of the building, since the proprietor had had one of its four original columns removed. Evidently durability had been considered throughout, for the courtyard was enclosed by a strong and very high wooden fence, and both the stables, the coach-house, and the culinary premises were partially constructed of beams warranted to last for centuries. Nay, even the wooden huts of the peasantry were wonderful in the solidity of their construction, and not a clay wall or a carved pattern or other device was to be seen. Everything fitted exactly into its right place, and even the draw-well of the mansion was fashioned of the oakwood usually thought suitable only for mills or ships. In short, wherever Chichikov's eye turned he saw nothing that was not free from shoddy make and well and skilfully arranged. As he approached the entrance steps he caught sight of two faces peering from a window. One of them was that of a woman in a mobcap with features as long and as narrow as a cucumber, and the other that of a man with features as broad and as short as the Moldavian pumpkins (known as gorlianki) whereof balallaiki—the species of light, two-stringed instrument which constitutes the pride and the joy of the gay young fellow of twenty as he sits winking and smiling at the white-necked, white-bosomed maidens who have gathered to listen to his low-pitched tinkling—are fashioned. This scrutiny made, both faces withdrew, and there came out on to the entrance steps a lacquey clad in a grey jacket and a stiff blue collar. This functionary conducted Chichikov into the hall, where he was met by the master of the house himself, who requested his guest to enter, and then led him into the inner part of the mansion.

A covert glance at Sobakevitch showed our hero that his host exactly resembled a moderate-sized bear. To complete the resemblance, Sobakevitch's long frockcoat and baggy trousers were of the precise colour of a bear's hide, while, when shuffling across the floor, he made a criss-cross motion of the legs, and had, in addition, a constant habit of treading upon his companion's toes. As for his face, it was of the warm, ardent tint of a piatok. Persons of this kind—persons to whose designing nature has devoted not much thought, and in the fashioning of whose frames she has used no instruments so delicate as a file or a gimlet and so forth—are not uncommon. Such persons she merely roughhews. One cut with a hatchet, and there results a nose; another such cut with a hatchet, and there materialises a pair of lips; two thrusts with a drill, and there issues a pair of eyes. Lastly, scorning to plane down the roughness, she sends out that person into the world, saying: “There is another live creature.” Sobakevitch was just such a ragged, curiously put together figure— though the above model would seem to have been followed more in his upper portion than in his lower. One result was that he seldom turned his head to look at the person with whom he was speaking, but, rather, directed his eyes towards, say, the stove corner or the doorway. As host and guest crossed the dining-room Chichikov directed a second glance at his companion. “He is a bear, and nothing but a bear,” he thought to himself. And, indeed, the strange comparison was inevitable. Incidentally, Sobakevitch's Christian name and patronymic were Michael Semenovitch. Of his habit of treading upon other people's toes Chichikov had become fully aware; wherefore he stepped cautiously, and, throughout, allowed his host to take the lead. As a matter of fact, Sobakevitch himself seemed conscious of his failing, for at intervals he would inquire: “I hope I have not hurt you?” and Chichikov, with a word of thanks, would reply that as yet he had sustained no injury.

At length they reached the drawing-room, where Sobakevitch pointed to an armchair, and invited his guest to be seated. Chichikov gazed with interest at the walls and the pictures. In every such picture there were portrayed either young men or Greek generals of the type of Movrogordato (clad in a red uniform and breaches), Kanaris, and others; and all these heroes were depicted with a solidity of thigh and a wealth of moustache which made the beholder simply shudder with awe. Among them there were placed also, according to some unknown system, and for some unknown reason, firstly, Bagration —tall and thin, and with a cluster of small flags and cannon beneath him, and the whole set in the narrowest of frames—and, secondly, the Greek heroine, Bobelina, whose legs looked larger than do the whole bodies of the drawing-room dandies of the present day. Apparently the master of the house was himself a man of health and strength, and therefore liked to have his apartments adorned with none but folk of equal vigour and robustness. Lastly, in the window, and suspected cheek by jowl with Bobelina, there hung a cage whence at intervals there peered forth a white-spotted blackbird. Like everything else in the apartment, it bore a strong resemblance to Sobakevitch. When host and guest had been conversing for two minutes or so the door opened, and there entered the hostess—a tall lady in a cap adorned with ribands of domestic colouring and manufacture. She entered deliberately, and held her head as erect as a palm.

“This is my wife, Theodulia Ivanovna,” said Sobakevitch.

Chichikov approached and took her hand. The fact that she raised it nearly to the level of his lips apprised him of the circumstance that it had just been rinsed in cucumber oil.

“My dear, allow me to introduce Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov,” added Sobakevitch. “He has the honour of being acquainted both with our Governor and with our Postmaster.”

Upon this Theodulia Ivanovna requested her guest to be seated, and accompanied the invitation with the kind of bow usually employed only by actresses who are playing the role of queens. Next, she took a seat upon the sofa, drew around her her merino gown, and sat thereafter without moving an eyelid or an eyebrow. As for Chichikov, he glanced upwards, and once more caught sight of Kanaris with his fat thighs and interminable moustache, and of Bobelina and the blackbird. For fully five minutes all present preserved a complete silence—the only sound audible being that of the blackbird's beak against the wooden floor of the cage as the creature fished for grains of corn. Meanwhile Chichikov again surveyed the room, and saw that everything in it was massive and clumsy in the highest degree; as also that everything was curiously in keeping with the master of the house. For example, in one corner of the apartment there stood a hazelwood bureau with a bulging body on four grotesque legs—the perfect image of a bear. Also, the tables and the chairs were of the same ponderous, unrestful order, and every single article in the room appeared to be saying either, “I, too, am a Sobakevitch,” or “I am exactly like Sobakevitch.”

“I heard speak of you one day when I was visiting the President of the Council,” said Chichikov, on perceiving that no one else had a mind to begin a conversation. “That was on Thursday last. We had a very pleasant evening.”

“Yes, on that occasion I was not there,” replied Sobakevitch.

“What a nice man he is!”

“Who is?” inquired Sobakevitch, gazing into the corner by the stove.

“The President of the Local Council.”

“Did he seem so to you? True, he is a mason, but he is also the greatest fool that the world ever saw.”

Chichikov started a little at this mordant criticism, but soon pulled himself together again, and continued:

“Of course, every man has his weakness. Yet the President seems to be an excellent fellow.”

“And do you think the same of the Governor?”

“Yes. Why not?”

“Because there exists no greater rogue than he.”

“What? The Governor a rogue?” ejaculated Chichikov, at a loss to understand how the official in question could come to be numbered with thieves. “Let me say that I should never have guessed it. Permit me also to remark that his conduct would hardly seem to bear out your opinion—he seems so gentle a man.” And in proof of this Chichikov cited the purses which the Governor knitted, and also expatiated on the mildness of his features.

“He has the face of a robber,” said Sobakevitch. “Were you to give him a knife, and to turn him loose on a turnpike, he would cut your throat for two kopecks. And the same with the Vice-Governor. The pair are just Gog and Magog.”

“Evidently he is not on good terms with them,” thought Chichikov to himself. “I had better pass to the Chief of Police, which whom he DOES seem to be friendly.” Accordingly he added aloud: “For my own part, I should give the preference to the Head of the Gendarmery. What a frank, outspoken nature he has! And what an element of simplicity does his expression contain!”

“He is mean to the core,” remarked Sobakevitch coldly. “He will sell you and cheat you, and then dine at your table. Yes, I know them all, and every one of them is a swindler, and the town a nest of rascals engaged in robbing one another. Not a man of the lot is there but would sell Christ. Yet stay: ONE decent fellow there is—the Public Prosecutor; though even HE, if the truth be told, is little better than a pig.”

After these eulogia Chichikov saw that it would be useless to continue running through the list of officials—more especially since suddenly he had remembered that Sobakevitch was not at any time given to commending his fellow man.

“Let us go to luncheon, my dear,” put in Theodulia Ivanovna to her spouse.

“Yes; pray come to table,” said Sobakevitch to his guest; whereupon they consumed the customary glass of vodka (accompanied by sundry snacks of salted cucumber and other dainties) with which Russians, both in town and country, preface a meal. Then they filed into the dining-room in the wake of the hostess, who sailed on ahead like a goose swimming across a pond. The small dining-table was found to be laid for four persons—the fourth place being occupied by a lady or a young girl (it would have been difficult to say which exactly) who might have been either a relative, the housekeeper, or a casual visitor. Certain persons in the world exist, not as personalities in themselves, but as spots or specks on the personalities of others. Always they are to be seen sitting in the same place, and holding their heads at exactly the same angle, so that one comes within an ace of mistaking them for furniture, and thinks to oneself that never since the day of their birth can they have spoken a single word.

“My dear,” said Sobakevitch, “the cabbage soup is excellent.” With that he finished his portion, and helped himself to a generous measure of niania — the dish which follows shtchi and consists of a sheep's stomach stuffed with black porridge, brains, and other things. “What niania this is!” he added to Chichikov. “Never would you get such stuff in a town, where one is given the devil knows what.”

“Nevertheless the Governor keeps a fair table,” said Chichikov.

“Yes, but do you know what all the stuff is MADE OF?” retorted Sobakevitch. “If you DID know you would never touch it.”

“Of course I am not in a position to say how it is prepared, but at least the pork cutlets and the boiled fish seemed excellent.”

“Ah, it might have been thought so; yet I know the way in which such things are bought in the market-place. They are bought by some rascal of a cook whom a Frenchman has taught how to skin a tomcat and then serve it up as hare.”

“Ugh! What horrible things you say!” put in Madame.

“Well, my dear, that is how things are done, and it is no fault of mine that it is so. Moreover, everything that is left over—everything that WE (pardon me for mentioning it) cast into the slop-pail—is used by such folk for making soup.”

“Always at table you begin talking like this!” objected his helpmeet.

“And why not?” said Sobakevitch. “I tell you straight that I would not eat such nastiness, even had I made it myself. Sugar a frog as much as you like, but never shall it pass MY lips. Nor would I swallow an oyster, for I know only too well what an oyster may resemble. But have some mutton, friend Chichikov. It is shoulder of mutton, and very different stuff from the mutton which they cook in noble kitchens—mutton which has been kicking about the market-place four days or more. All that sort of cookery has been invented by French and German doctors, and I should like to hang them for having done so. They go and prescribe diets and a hunger cure as though what suits their flaccid German systems will agree with a Russian stomach! Such devices are no good at all.” Sobakevitch shook his head wrathfully. “Fellows like those are for ever talking of civilisation. As if THAT sort of thing was civilisation! Phew!” (Perhaps the speaker's concluding exclamation would have been even stronger had he not been seated at table.) “For myself, I will have none of it. When I eat pork at a meal, give me the WHOLE pig; when mutton, the WHOLE sheep; when goose, the WHOLE of the bird. Two dishes are better than a thousand, provided that one can eat of them as much as one wants.”

And he proceeded to put precept into practice by taking half the shoulder of mutton on to his plate, and then devouring it down to the last morsel of gristle and bone.

“My word!” reflected Chichikov. “The fellow has a pretty good holding capacity!”

“None of it for me,” repeated Sobakevitch as he wiped his hands on his napkin. “I don't intend to be like a fellow named Plushkin, who owns eight hundred souls, yet dines worse than does my shepherd.”

“Who is Plushkin?” asked Chichikov.

“A miser,” replied Sobakevitch. “Such a miser as never you could imagine. Even convicts in prison live better than he does. And he starves his servants as well.”

“Really?” ejaculated Chichikov, greatly interested. “Should you, then, say that he has lost many peasants by death?”

“Certainly. They keep dying like flies.”

“Then how far from here does he reside?”

“About five versts.”

“Only five versts?” exclaimed Chichikov, feeling his heart beating joyously. “Ought one, when leaving your gates, to turn to the right or to the left?”

“I should be sorry to tell you the way to the house of such a cur,” said Sobakevitch. “A man had far better go to hell than to Plushkin's.”

“Quite so,” responded Chichikov. “My only reason for asking you is that it interests me to become acquainted with any and every sort of locality.”

To the shoulder of mutton there succeeded, in turn, cutlets (each one larger than a plate), a turkey of about the size of a calf, eggs, rice, pastry, and every conceivable thing which could possibly be put into a stomach. There the meal ended. When he rose from table Chichikov felt as though a pood's weight were inside him. In the drawing-room the company found dessert awaiting them in the shape of pears, plums, and apples; but since neither host nor guest could tackle these particular dainties the hostess removed them to another room. Taking advantage of her absence, Chichikov turned to Sobakevitch (who, prone in an armchair, seemed, after his ponderous meal, to be capable of doing little beyond belching and grunting—each such grunt or belch necessitating a subsequent signing of the cross over the mouth), and intimated to him a desire to have a little private conversation concerning a certain matter. At this moment the hostess returned.

“Here is more dessert,” she said. “Pray have a few radishes stewed in honey.”

“Later, later,” replied Sobakevitch. “Do you go to your room, and Paul Ivanovitch and I will take off our coats and have a nap.”

Upon this the good lady expressed her readiness to send for feather beds and cushions, but her husband expressed a preference for slumbering in an armchair, and she therefore departed. When she had gone Sobakevitch inclined his head in an attitude of willingness to listen to Chichikov's business. Our hero began in a sort of detached manner—touching lightly upon the subject of the Russian Empire, and expatiating upon the immensity of the same, and saying that even the Empire of Ancient Rome had been of considerably smaller dimensions. Meanwhile Sobakevitch sat with his head drooping.

From that Chichikov went on to remark that, according to the statutes of the said Russian Empire (which yielded to none in glory—so much so that foreigners marvelled at it), peasants on the census lists who had ended their earthly careers were nevertheless, on the rendering of new lists, returned equally with the living, to the end that the courts might be relieved of a multitude of trifling, useless emendations which might complicate the already sufficiently complex mechanism of the State. Nevertheless, said Chichikov, the general equity of this measure did not obviate a certain amount of annoyance to landowners, since it forced them to pay upon a non-living article the tax due upon a living. Hence (our hero concluded) he (Chichikov) was prepared, owing to the personal respect which he felt for Sobakevitch, to relieve him, in part, of the irksome obligation referred to (in passing, it may be said that Chichikov referred to his principal point only guardedly, for he called the souls which he was seeking not “dead,” but “non-existent”).

Meanwhile Sobakevitch listened with bent head; though something like a trace of expression dawned in his face as he did so. Ordinarily his body lacked a soul—or, if he did posses a soul, he seemed to keep it elsewhere than where it ought to have been; so that, buried beneath mountains (as it were) or enclosed within a massive shell, its movements produced no sort of agitation on the surface.

“Well?” said Chichikov—though not without a certain tremor of diffidence as to the possible response.

“You are after dead souls?” were Sobakevitch's perfectly simple words. He spoke without the least surprise in his tone, and much as though the conversation had been turning on grain.

“Yes,” replied Chichikov, and then, as before, softened down the expression “dead souls.”

“They are to be found,” said Sobakevitch. “Why should they not be?”

“Then of course you will be glad to get rid of any that you may chance to have?”

“Yes, I shall have no objection to SELLING them.” At this point the speaker raised his head a little, for it had struck him that surely the would-be buyer must have some advantage in view.

“The devil!” thought Chichikov to himself. “Here is he selling the goods before I have even had time to utter a word!”

“And what about the price?” he added aloud. “Of course, the articles are not of a kind very easy to appraise.”

“I should be sorry to ask too much,” said Sobakevitch. “How would a hundred roubles per head suit you?”

“What, a hundred roubles per head?” Chichikov stared open-mouthed at his host—doubting whether he had heard aright, or whether his host's slow-moving tongue might not have inadvertently substituted one word for another.

“Yes. Is that too much for you?” said Sobakevitch. Then he added: “What is your own price?”

“My own price? I think that we cannot properly have understood one another—that you must have forgotten of what the goods consist. With my hand on my heart do I submit that eight grivni per soul would be a handsome, a VERY handsome, offer.”

“What? Eight grivni?”

“In my opinion, a higher offer would be impossible.”

“But I am not a seller of boots.”

“No; yet you, for your part, will agree that these souls are not live human beings?”

“I suppose you hope to find fools ready to sell you souls on the census list for a couple of groats apiece?”

“Pardon me, but why do you use the term ‘on the census list’? The souls themselves have long since passed away, and have left behind them only their names. Not to trouble you with any further discussion of the subject, I can offer you a rouble and a half per head, but no more.”

“You should be ashamed even to mention such a sum! Since you deal in articles of this kind, quote me a genuine price.”

“I cannot, Michael Semenovitch. Believe me, I cannot. What a man cannot do, that he cannot do.” The speaker ended by advancing another half-rouble per head.

“But why hang back with your money?” said Sobakevitch. “Of a truth I am not asking much of you. Any other rascal than myself would have cheated you by selling you old rubbish instead of good, genuine souls, whereas I should be ready to give you of my best, even were you buying only nut-kernels. For instance, look at wheelwright Michiev. Never was there such a one to build spring carts! And his handiwork was not like your Moscow handiwork—good only for an hour. No, he did it all himself, even down to the varnishing.”

Chichikov opened his mouth to remark that, nevertheless, the said Michiev had long since departed this world; but Sobakevitch's eloquence had got too thoroughly into its stride to admit of any interruption.

“And look, too, at Probka Stepan, the carpenter,” his host went on. “I will wager my head that nowhere else would you find such a workman. What a strong fellow he was! He had served in the Guards, and the Lord only knows what they had given for him, seeing that he was over three arshins in height.”

Again Chichikov tried to remark that Probka was dead, but Sobakevitch's tongue was borne on the torrent of its own verbiage, and the only thing to be done was to listen.

“And Milushkin, the bricklayer! He could build a stove in any house you liked! And Maksim Teliatnikov, the bootmaker! Anything that he drove his awl into became a pair of boots—and boots for which you would be thankful, although he WAS a bit foul of the mouth. And Eremi Sorokoplechin, too! He was the best of the lot, and used to work at his trade in Moscow, where he paid a tax of five hundred roubles. Well, THERE'S an assortment of serfs for you!—a very different assortment from what Plushkin would sell you!”

“But permit me,” at length put in Chichikov, astounded at this flood of eloquence to which there appeared to be no end. “Permit me, I say, to inquire why you enumerate the talents of the deceased, seeing that they are all of them dead, and that therefore there can be no sense in doing so. ‘A dead body is only good to prop a fence with,’ says the proverb.”

“Of course they are dead,” replied Sobakevitch, but rather as though the idea had only just occurred to him, and was giving him food for thought. “But tell me, now: what is the use of listing them as still alive? And what is the use of them themselves? They are flies, not human beings.”

“Well,” said Chichikov, “they exist, though only in idea.”

“But no—NOT only in idea. I tell you that nowhere else would you find such a fellow for working heavy tools as was Michiev. He had the strength of a horse in his shoulders.” And, with the words, Sobakevitch turned, as though for corroboration, to the portrait of Bagration, as is frequently done by one of the parties in a dispute when he purports to appeal to an extraneous individual who is not only unknown to him, but wholly unconnected with the subject in hand; with the result that the individual is left in doubt whether to make a reply, or whether to betake himself elsewhere.

“Nevertheless, I CANNOT give you more than two roubles per head,” said Chichikov.

“Well, as I don't want you to swear that I have asked too much of you and won't meet you halfway, suppose, for friendship's sake, that you pay me seventy-five roubles in assignats?”

“Good heavens!” thought Chichikov to himself. “Does the man take me for a fool?” Then he added aloud: “The situation seems to me a strange one, for it is as though we were performing a stage comedy. No other explanation would meet the case. Yet you appear to be a man of sense, and possessed of some education. The matter is a very simple one. The question is: what is a dead soul worth, and is it of any use to any one?”

“It is of use to YOU, or you would not be buying such articles.”

Chichikov bit his lip, and stood at a loss for a retort. He tried to saying something about “family and domestic circumstances,” but Sobakevitch cut him short with:

“I don't want to know your private affairs, for I never poke my nose into such things. You need the souls, and I am ready to sell them. Should you not buy them, I think you will repent it.”

“Two roubles is my price,” repeated Chichikov.

“Come, come! As you have named that sum, I can understand your not liking to go back upon it; but quote me a bona fide figure.”

“The devil fly away with him!” mused Chichikov. “However, I will add another half-rouble.” And he did so.

“Indeed?” said Sobakevitch. “Well, my last word upon it is—fifty roubles in assignats. That will mean a sheer loss to me, for nowhere else in the world could you buy better souls than mine.”

“The old skinflint!” muttered Chichikov. Then he added aloud, with irritation in his tone: “See here. This is a serious matter. Any one but you would be thankful to get rid of the souls. Only a fool would stick to them, and continue to pay the tax.”

“Yes, but remember (and I say it wholly in a friendly way) that transactions of this kind are not generally allowed, and that any one would say that a man who engages in them must have some rather doubtful advantage in view.”

“Have it your own away,” said Chichikov, with assumed indifference. “As a matter of fact, I am not purchasing for profit, as you suppose, but to humour a certain whim of mine. Two and a half roubles is the most that I can offer.”

“Bless your heart!” retorted the host. “At least give me thirty roubles in assignats, and take the lot.”

“No, for I see that you are unwilling to sell. I must say good-day to you.”

“Hold on, hold on!” exclaimed Sobakevitch, retaining his guest's hand, and at the same moment treading heavily upon his toes—so heavily, indeed, that Chichikov gasped and danced with the pain.

“I BEG your pardon!” said Sobakevitch hastily. “Evidently I have hurt you. Pray sit down again.”

“No,” retorted Chichikov. “I am merely wasting my time, and must be off.”

“Oh, sit down just for a moment. I have something more agreeable to say.” And, drawing closer to his guest, Sobakevitch whispered in his ear, as though communicating to him a secret: “How about twenty-five roubles?”

“No, no, no!” exclaimed Chichikov. “I won't give you even a QUARTER of that. I won't advance another kopeck.”

For a while Sobakevitch remained silent, and Chichikov did the same. This lasted for a couple of minutes, and, meanwhile, the aquiline-nosed Bagration gazed from the wall as though much interested in the bargaining.

“What is your outside price?” at length said Sobakevitch.

“Two and a half roubles.”

“Then you seem to rate a human soul at about the same value as a boiled turnip. At least give me THREE roubles.”

“No, I cannot.”

“Pardon me, but you are an impossible man to deal with. However, even though it will mean a dead loss to me, and you have not shown a very nice spirit about it, I cannot well refuse to please a friend. I suppose a purchase deed had better be made out in order to have everything in order?”

“Of course.”

“Then for that purpose let us repair to the town.”

The affair ended in their deciding to do this on the morrow, and to arrange for the signing of a deed of purchase. Next, Chichikov requested a list of the peasants; to which Sobakevitch readily agreed. Indeed, he went to his writing-desk then and there, and started to indite a list which gave not only the peasants' names, but also their late qualifications.

Meanwhile Chichikov, having nothing else to do, stood looking at the spacious form of his host; and as he gazed at his back as broad as that of a cart horse, and at the legs as massive as the iron standards which adorn a street, he could not help inwardly ejaculating:

“Truly God has endowed you with much! Though not adjusted with nicety, at least you are strongly built. I wonder whether you were born a bear or whether you have come to it through your rustic life, with its tilling of crops and its trading with peasants? Yet no; I believe that, even if you had received a fashionable education, and had mixed with society, and had lived in St. Petersburg, you would still have been just the kulak that you are. The only difference is that circumstances, as they stand, permit of your polishing off a stuffed shoulder of mutton at a meal; whereas in St. Petersburg you would have been unable to do so. Also, as circumstances stand, you have under you a number of peasants, whom you treat well for the reason that they are your property; whereas, otherwise, you would have had under you tchinovniks : whom you would have bullied because they were NOT your property. Also, you would have robbed the Treasury, since a kulak always remains a money-grubber.”

“The list is ready,” said Sobakevitch, turning round.

“Indeed? Then please let me look at it.” Chichikov ran his eye over the document, and could not but marvel at its neatness and accuracy. Not only were there set forth in it the trade, the age, and the pedigree of every serf, but on the margin of the sheet were jotted remarks concerning each serf's conduct and sobriety. Truly it was a pleasure to look at it.

“And do you mind handing me the earnest money?” said Sobakevitch?

“Yes, I do. Why need that be done? You can receive the money in a lump sum as soon as we visit the town.”

“But it is always the custom, you know,” asserted Sobakevitch.

“Then I cannot follow it, for I have no money with me. However, here are ten roubles.”

“Ten roubles, indeed? You might as well hand me fifty while you are about it.”

Once more Chichikov started to deny that he had any money upon him, but Sobakevitch insisted so strongly that this was not so that at length the guest pulled out another fifteen roubles, and added them to the ten already produced.

“Kindly give me a receipt for the money,” he added.

“A receipt? Why should I give you a receipt?”

“Because it is better to do so, in order to guard against mistakes.”

“Very well; but first hand me over the money.”

“The money? I have it here. Do you write out the receipt, and then the money shall be yours.”

“Pardon me, but how am I to write out the receipt before I have seen the cash?”

Chichikov placed the notes in Sobakevitch's hand; whereupon the host moved nearer to the table, and added to the list of serfs a note that he had received for the peasants, therewith sold, the sum of twenty-five roubles, as earnest money. This done, he counted the notes once more. “This is a very OLD note,” he remarked, holding one up to the light. “Also, it is a trifle torn. However, in a friendly transaction one must not be too particular.”

“What a kulak!” thought Chichikov to himself. “And what a brute beast!”

“Then you do not want any WOMEN souls?” queried Sobakevitch.

“I thank you, no.”

“I could let you have some cheap—say, as between friends, at a rouble a head?”

“No, I should have no use for them.”

“Then, that being so, there is no more to be said. There is no accounting for tastes. ‘One man loves the priest, and another the priest's wife,’ says the proverb.”

Chichikov rose to take his leave. “Once more I would request of you,” he said, “that the bargain be left as it is.”

“Of course, of course. What is done between friends holds good because of their mutual friendship. Good-bye, and thank you for your visit. In advance I would beg that, whenever you should have an hour or two to spare, you will come and lunch with us again. Perhaps we might be able to do one another further service?”

“Not if I know it!” reflected Chichikov as he mounted his britchka. “Not I, seeing that I have had two and a half roubles per soul squeezed out of me by a brute of a kulak!”

Altogether he felt dissatisfied with Sobakevitch's behaviour. In spite of the man being a friend of the Governor and the Chief of Police, he had acted like an outsider in taking money for what was worthless rubbish. As the britchka left the courtyard Chichikov glanced back and saw Sobakevitch still standing on the verandah—apparently for the purpose of watching to see which way the guest's carriage would turn.

“The old villain, to be still standing there!” muttered Chichikov through his teeth; after which he ordered Selifan to proceed so that the vehicle's progress should be invisible from the mansion—the truth being that he had a mind next to visit Plushkin (whose serfs, to quote Sobakevitch, had a habit of dying like flies), but not to let his late host learn of his intention. Accordingly, on reaching the further end of the village, he hailed the first peasant whom he saw—a man who was in the act of hoisting a ponderous beam on to his shoulder before setting off with it, ant-like, to his hut.

“Hi!” shouted Chichikov. “How can I reach landowner Plushkin's place without first going past the mansion here?”

The peasant seemed nonplussed by the question.

“Don't you know?” queried Chichikov.

“No, barin,” replied the peasant.

“What? You don't know skinflint Plushkin who feeds his people so badly?”

“Of course I do!” exclaimed the fellow, and added thereto an uncomplimentary expression of a species not ordinarily employed in polite society. We may guess that it was a pretty apt expression, since long after the man had become lost to view Chichikov was still laughing in his britchka. And, indeed, the language of the Russian populace is always forcible in its phraseology.





CHAPTER VI


Chichikov's amusement at the peasant's outburst prevented him from noticing that he had reached the centre of a large and populous village; but, presently, a violent jolt aroused him to the fact that he was driving over wooden pavements of a kind compared with which the cobblestones of the town had been as nothing. Like the keys of a piano, the planks kept rising and falling, and unguarded passage over them entailed either a bump on the back of the neck or a bruise on the forehead or a bite on the tip of one's tongue. At the same time Chichikov noticed a look of decay about the buildings of the village. The beams of the huts had grown dark with age, many of their roofs were riddled with holes, others had but a tile of the roof remaining, and yet others were reduced to the rib-like framework of the same. It would seem as though the inhabitants themselves had removed the laths and traverses, on the very natural plea that the huts were no protection against the rain, and therefore, since the latter entered in bucketfuls, there was no particular object to be gained by sitting in such huts when all the time there was the tavern and the highroad and other places to resort to. Suddenly a woman appeared from an outbuilding—apparently the housekeeper of the mansion, but so roughly and dirtily dressed as almost to seem indistinguishable from a man. Chichikov inquired for the master of the place.

“He is not at home,” she replied, almost before her interlocutor had had time to finish. Then she added: “What do you want with him?”

“I have some business to do,” said Chichikov.

“Then pray walk into the house,” the woman advised. Then she turned upon him a back that was smeared with flour and had a long slit in the lower portion of its covering. Entering a large, dark hall which reeked like a tomb, he passed into an equally dark parlour that was lighted only by such rays as contrived to filter through a crack under the door. When Chichikov opened the door in question, the spectacle of the untidiness within struck him almost with amazement. It would seem that the floor was never washed, and that the room was used as a receptacle for every conceivable kind of furniture. On a table stood a ragged chair, with, beside it, a clock minus a pendulum and covered all over with cobwebs. Against a wall leant a cupboard, full of old silver, glassware, and china. On a writing table, inlaid with mother-of-pearl which, in places, had broken away and left behind it a number of yellow grooves (stuffed with putty), lay a pile of finely written manuscript, an overturned marble press (turning green), an ancient book in a leather cover with red edges, a lemon dried and shrunken to the dimensions of a hazelnut, the broken arm of a chair, a tumbler containing the dregs of some liquid and three flies (the whole covered over with a sheet of notepaper), a pile of rags, two ink-encrusted pens, and a yellow toothpick with which the master of the house had picked his teeth (apparently) at least before the coming of the French to Moscow. As for the walls, they were hung with a medley of pictures. Among the latter was a long engraving of a battle scene, wherein soldiers in three-cornered hats were brandishing huge drums and slender lances. It lacked a glass, and was set in a frame ornamented with bronze fretwork and bronze corner rings. Beside it hung a huge, grimy oil painting representative of some flowers and fruit, half a water melon, a boar's head, and the pendent form of a dead wild duck. Attached to the ceiling there was a chandelier in a holland covering—the covering so dusty as closely to resemble a huge cocoon enclosing a caterpillar. Lastly, in one corner of the room lay a pile of articles which had evidently been adjudged unworthy of a place on the table. Yet what the pile consisted of it would have been difficult to say, seeing that the dust on the same was so thick that any hand which touched it would have at once resembled a glove. Prominently protruding from the pile was the shaft of a wooden spade and the antiquated sole of a shoe. Never would one have supposed that a living creature had tenanted the room, were it not that the presence of such a creature was betrayed by the spectacle of an old nightcap resting on the table.

Whilst Chichikov was gazing at this extraordinary mess, a side door opened and there entered the housekeeper who had met him near the outbuildings. But now Chichikov perceived this person to be a man rather than a woman, since a female housekeeper would have had no beard to shave, whereas the chin of the newcomer, with the lower portion of his cheeks, strongly resembled the curry-comb which is used for grooming horses. Chichikov assumed a questioning air, and waited to hear what the housekeeper might have to say. The housekeeper did the same. At length, surprised at the misunderstanding, Chichikov decided to ask the first question.

“Is the master at home?” he inquired.

“Yes,” replied the person addressed.

“Then were is he?” continued Chichikov.

“Are you blind, my good sir?” retorted the other. “I am the master.”

Involuntarily our hero started and stared. During his travels it had befallen him to meet various types of men—some of them, it may be, types which you and I have never encountered; but even to Chichikov this particular species was new. In the old man's face there was nothing very special—it was much like the wizened face of many another dotard, save that the chin was so greatly projected that whenever he spoke he was forced to wipe it with a handkerchief to avoid dribbling, and that his small eyes were not yet grown dull, but twinkled under their overhanging brows like the eyes of mice when, with attentive ears and sensitive whiskers, they snuff the air and peer forth from their holes to see whether a cat or a boy may not be in the vicinity. No, the most noticeable feature about the man was his clothes. In no way could it have been guessed of what his coat was made, for both its sleeves and its skirts were so ragged and filthy as to defy description, while instead of two posterior tails, there dangled four of those appendages, with, projecting from them, a torn newspaper. Also, around his neck there was wrapped something which might have been a stocking, a garter, or a stomacher, but was certainly not a tie. In short, had Chichikov chanced to encounter him at a church door, he would have bestowed upon him a copper or two (for, to do our hero justice, he had a sympathetic heart and never refrained from presenting a beggar with alms), but in the present case there was standing before him, not a mendicant, but a landowner—and a landowner possessed of fully a thousand serfs, the superior of all his neighbours in wealth of flour and grain, and the owner of storehouses, and so forth, that were crammed with homespun cloth and linen, tanned and undressed sheepskins, dried fish, and every conceivable species of produce. Nevertheless, such a phenomenon is rare in Russia, where the tendency is rather to prodigality than to parsimony.

For several minutes Plushkin stood mute, while Chichikov remained so dazed with the appearance of the host and everything else in the room, that he too, could not begin a conversation, but stood wondering how best to find words in which to explain the object of his visit. For a while he thought of expressing himself to the effect that, having heard so much of his host's benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit, he had considered it his duty to come and pay a tribute of respect; but presently even HE came to the conclusion that this would be overdoing the thing, and, after another glance round the room, decided that the phrase “benevolence and other rare qualities of spirit” might to advantage give place to “economy and genius for method.” Accordingly, the speech mentally composed, he said aloud that, having heard of Plushkin's talents for thrifty and systematic management, he had considered himself bound to make the acquaintance of his host, and to present him with his personal compliments (I need hardly say that Chichikov could easily have alleged a better reason, had any better one happened, at the moment, to have come into his head).

With toothless gums Plushkin murmured something in reply, but nothing is known as to its precise terms beyond that it included a statement that the devil was at liberty to fly away with Chichikov's sentiments. However, the laws of Russian hospitality do not permit even of a miser infringing their rules; wherefore Plushkin added to the foregoing a more civil invitation to be seated.

“It is long since I last received a visitor,” he went on. “Also, I feel bound to say that I can see little good in their coming. Once introduce the abominable custom of folk paying calls, and forthwith there will ensue such ruin to the management of estates that landowners will be forced to feed their horses on hay. Not for a long, long time have I eaten a meal away from home—although my own kitchen is a poor one, and has its chimney in such a state that, were it to become overheated, it would instantly catch fire.”

“What a brute!” thought Chichikov. “I am lucky to have got through so much pastry and stuffed shoulder of mutton at Sobakevitch's!”

“Also,” went on Plushkin, “I am ashamed to say that hardly a wisp of fodder does the place contain. But how can I get fodder? My lands are small, and the peasantry lazy fellows who hate work and think of nothing but the tavern. In the end, therefore, I shall be forced to go and spend my old age in roaming about the world.”

“But I have been told that you possess over a thousand serfs?” said Chichikov.

“Who told you that? No matter who it was, you would have been justified in giving him the lie. He must have been a jester who wanted to make a fool of you. A thousand souls, indeed! Why, just reckon the taxes on them, and see what there would be left! For these three years that accursed fever has been killing off my serfs wholesale.”

“Wholesale, you say?” echoed Chichikov, greatly interested.

“Yes, wholesale,” replied the old man.

“Then might I ask you the exact number?”

“Fully eighty.”

“Surely not?”

“But it is so.”

“Then might I also ask whether it is from the date of the last census revision that you are reckoning these souls?”

“Yes, damn it! And since that date I have been bled for taxes upon a hundred and twenty souls in all.”

“Indeed? Upon a hundred and twenty souls in all!” And Chichikov's surprise and elation were such that, this said, he remained sitting open-mouthed.

“Yes, good sir,” replied Plushkin. “I am too old to tell you lies, for I have passed my seventieth year.”

Somehow he seemed to have taken offence at Chichikov's almost joyous exclamation; wherefore the guest hastened to heave a profound sigh, and to observe that he sympathised to the full with his host's misfortunes.

“But sympathy does not put anything into one's pocket,” retorted Plushkin. “For instance, I have a kinsman who is constantly plaguing me. He is a captain in the army, damn him, and all day he does nothing but call me ‘dear uncle,’ and kiss my hand, and express sympathy until I am forced to stop my ears. You see, he has squandered all his money upon his brother-officers, as well as made a fool of himself with an actress; so now he spends his time in telling me that he has a sympathetic heart!”

Chichikov hastened to explain that HIS sympathy had nothing in common with the captain's, since he dealt, not in empty words alone, but in actual deeds; in proof of which he was ready then and there (for the purpose of cutting the matter short, and of dispensing with circumlocution) to transfer to himself the obligation of paying the taxes due upon such serfs as Plushkin's as had, in the unfortunate manner just described, departed this world. The proposal seemed to astonish Plushkin, for he sat staring open-eyed. At length he inquired:

“My dear sir, have you seen military service?”

“No,” replied the other warily, “but I have been a member of the CIVIL Service.”

“Oh! Of the CIVIL Service?” And Plushkin sat moving his lips as though he were chewing something. “Well, what of your proposal?” he added presently. “Are you prepared to lose by it?”

“Yes, certainly, if thereby I can please you.”

“My dear sir! My good benefactor!” In his delight Plushkin lost sight of the fact that his nose was caked with snuff of the consistency of thick coffee, and that his coat had parted in front and was disclosing some very unseemly underclothing. “What comfort you have brought to an old man! Yes, as God is my witness!”

For the moment he could say no more. Yet barely a minute had elapsed before this instantaneously aroused emotion had, as instantaneously, disappeared from his wooden features. Once more they assumed a careworn expression, and he even wiped his face with his handkerchief, then rolled it into a ball, and rubbed it to and fro against his upper lip.

“If it will not annoy you again to state the proposal,” he went on, “what you undertake to do is to pay the annual tax upon these souls, and to remit the money either to me or to the Treasury?”

“Yes, that is how it shall be done. We will draw up a deed of purchase as though the souls were still alive and you had sold them to myself.”

“Quite so—a deed of purchase,” echoed Plushkin, once more relapsing into thought and the chewing motion of the lips. “But a deed of such a kind will entail certain expenses, and lawyers are so devoid of conscience! In fact, so extortionate is their avarice that they will charge one half a rouble, and then a sack of flour, and then a whole waggon-load of meal. I wonder that no one has yet called attention to the system.”

Upon that Chichikov intimated that, out of respect for his host, he himself would bear the cost of the transfer of souls. This led Plushkin to conclude that his guest must be the kind of unconscionable fool who, while pretending to have been a member of the Civil Service, has in reality served in the army and run after actresses; wherefore the old man no longer disguised his delight, but called down blessings alike upon Chichikov's head and upon those of his children (he had never even inquired whether Chichikov possessed a family). Next, he shuffled to the window, and, tapping one of its panes, shouted the name of “Proshka.” Immediately some one ran quickly into the hall, and, after much stamping of feet, burst into the room. This was Proshka—a thirteen-year-old youngster who was shod with boots of such dimensions as almost to engulf his legs as he walked. The reason why he had entered thus shod was that Plushkin only kept one pair of boots for the whole of his domestic staff. This universal pair was stationed in the hall of the mansion, so that any servant who was summoned to the house might don the said boots after wading barefooted through the mud of the courtyard, and enter the parlour dry-shod—subsequently leaving the boots where he had found them, and departing in his former barefooted condition. Indeed, had any one, on a slushy winter's morning, glanced from a window into the said courtyard, he would have seen Plushkin's servitors performing saltatory feats worthy of the most vigorous of stage-dancers.

“Look at that boy's face!” said Plushkin to Chichikov as he pointed to Proshka. “It is stupid enough, yet, lay anything aside, and in a trice he will have stolen it. Well, my lad, what do you want?”

He paused a moment or two, but Proshka made no reply.

“Come, come!” went on the old man. “Set out the samovar, and then give Mavra the key of the store-room—here it is—and tell her to get out some loaf sugar for tea. Here! Wait another moment, fool! Is the devil in your legs that they itch so to be off? Listen to what more I have to tell you. Tell Mavra that the sugar on the outside of the loaf has gone bad, so that she must scrape it off with a knife, and NOT throw away the scrapings, but give them to the poultry. Also, see that you yourself don't go into the storeroom, or I will give you a birching that you won't care for. Your appetite is good enough already, but a better one won't hurt you. Don't even TRY to go into the storeroom, for I shall be watching you from this window.”

“You see,” the old man added to Chichikov, “one can never trust these fellows.” Presently, when Proshka and the boots had departed, he fell to gazing at his guest with an equally distrustful air, since certain features in Chichikov's benevolence now struck him as a little open to question, and he had begin to think to himself: “After all, the devil only knows who he is—whether a braggart, like most of these spendthrifts, or a fellow who is lying merely in order to get some tea out of me.” Finally, his circumspection, combined with a desire to test his guest, led him to remark that it might be well to complete the transaction IMMEDIATELY, since he had not overmuch confidence in humanity, seeing that a man might be alive to-day and dead tomorrow.

To this Chichikov assented readily enough—merely adding that he should like first of all to be furnished with a list of the dead souls. This reassured Plushkin as to his guest's intention of doing business, so he got out his keys, approached a cupboard, and, having pulled back the door, rummaged among the cups and glasses with which it was filled. At length he said:

“I cannot find it now, but I used to possess a splendid bottle of liquor. Probably the servants have drunk it all, for they are such thieves. Oh no: perhaps this is it!”

Looking up, Chichikov saw that Plushkin had extracted a decanter coated with dust.

“My late wife made the stuff,” went on the old man, “but that rascal of a housekeeper went and threw away a lot of it, and never even replaced the stopper. Consequently bugs and other nasty creatures got into the decanter, but I cleaned it out, and now beg to offer you a glassful.”

The idea of a drink from such a receptacle was too much for Chichikov, so he excused himself on the ground that he had just had luncheon.

“You have just had luncheon?” re-echoed Plushkin. “Now, THAT shows how invariably one can tell a man of good society, wheresoever one may be. A man of that kind never eats anything—he always says that he has had enough. Very different that from the ways of a rogue, whom one can never satisfy, however much one may give him. For instance, that captain of mine is constantly begging me to let him have a meal—though he is about as much my nephew as I am his grandfather. As it happens, there is never a bite of anything in the house, so he has to go away empty. But about the list of those good-for-nothing souls—I happen to possess such a list, since I have drawn one up in readiness for the next revision.”

With that Plushkin donned his spectacles, and once more started to rummage in the cupboard, and to smother his guest with dust as he untied successive packages of papers—so much so that his victim burst out sneezing. Finally he extracted a much-scribbled document in which the names of the deceased peasants lay as close-packed as a cloud of midges, for there were a hundred and twenty of them in all. Chichikov grinned with joy at the sight of the multitude. Stuffing the list into his pocket, he remarked that, to complete the transaction, it would be necessary to return to the town.

“To the town?” repeated Plushkin. “But why? Moreover, how could I leave the house, seeing that every one of my servants is either a thief or a rogue? Day by day they pilfer things, until soon I shall have not a single coat to hang on my back.”

“Then you possess acquaintances in the town?”

“Acquaintances? No. Every acquaintance whom I ever possessed has either left me or is dead. But stop a moment. I DO know the President of the Council. Even in my old age he has once or twice come to visit me, for he and I used to be schoolfellows, and to go climbing walls together. Yes, him I do know. Shall I write him a letter?”

“By all means.”

“Yes, him I know well, for we were friends together at school.”

Over Plushkin's wooden features there had gleamed a ray of warmth—a ray which expressed, if not feeling, at all events feeling's pale reflection. Just such a phenomenon may be witnessed when, for a brief moment, a drowning man makes a last re-appearance on the surface of a river, and there rises from the crowd lining the banks a cry of hope that even yet the exhausted hands may clutch the rope which has been thrown him—may clutch it before the surface of the unstable element shall have resumed for ever its calm, dread vacuity. But the hope is short-lived, and the hands disappear. Even so did Plushkin's face, after its momentary manifestation of feeling, become meaner and more insensible than ever.

“There used to be a sheet of clean writing paper lying on the table,” he went on. “But where it is now I cannot think. That comes of my servants being such rascals.”

Whit that he fell to looking also under the table, as well as to hurrying about with cries of “Mavra, Mavra!” At length the call was answered by a woman with a plateful of the sugar of which mention has been made; whereupon there ensued the following conversation.

“What have you done with my piece of writing paper, you pilferer?”

“I swear that I have seen no paper except the bit with which you covered the glass.”

“Your very face tells me that you have made off with it.”

“Why should I make off with it? 'Twould be of no use to me, for I can neither read nor write.”

“You lie! You have taken it away for the sexton to scribble upon.”

“Well, if the sexton wanted paper he could get some for himself. Neither he nor I have set eyes upon your piece.”

“Ah! Wait a bit, for on the Judgment Day you will be roasted by devils on iron spits. Just see if you are not!”

“But why should I be roasted when I have never even TOUCHED the paper? You might accuse me of any other fault than theft.”

“Nay, devils shall roast you, sure enough. They will say to you, ‘Bad woman, we are doing this because you robbed your master,’ and then stoke up the fire still hotter.”

“Nevertheless I shall continue to say, ‘You are roasting me for nothing, for I never stole anything at all.’ Why, THERE it is, lying on the table! You have been accusing me for no reason whatever!”

And, sure enough, the sheet of paper was lying before Plushkin's very eyes. For a moment or two he chewed silently. Then he went on:

“Well, and what are you making such a noise about? If one says a single word to you, you answer back with ten. Go and fetch me a candle to seal a letter with. And mind you bring a TALLOW candle, for it will not cost so much as the other sort. And bring me a match too.”

Mavra departed, and Plushkin, seating himself, and taking up a pen, sat turning the sheet of paper over and over, as though in doubt whether to tear from it yet another morsel. At length he came to the conclusion that it was impossible to do so, and therefore, dipping the pen into the mixture of mouldy fluid and dead flies which the ink bottle contained, started to indite the letter in characters as bold as the notes of a music score, while momentarily checking the speed of his hand, lest it should meander too much over the paper, and crawling from line to line as though he regretted that there was so little vacant space left on the sheet.

“And do you happen to know any one to whom a few runaway serfs would be of use?” he asked as subsequently he folded the letter.

“What? You have some runaways as well?” exclaimed Chichikov, again greatly interested.

“Certainly I have. My son-in-law has laid the necessary information against them, but says that their tracks have grown cold. However, he is only a military man—that is to say, good at clinking a pair of spurs, but of no use for laying a plea before a court.”

“And how many runaways have you?”

“About seventy.”

“Surely not?”

“Alas, yes. Never does a year pass without a certain number of them making off. Yet so gluttonous and idle are my serfs that they are simply bursting with food, whereas I scarcely get enough to eat. I will take any price for them that you may care to offer. Tell your friends about it, and, should they find even a score of the runaways, it will repay them handsomely, seeing that a living serf on the census list is at present worth five hundred roubles.”

“Perhaps so, but I am not going to let any one but myself have a finger in this,” thought Chichikov to himself; after which he explained to Plushkin that a friend of the kind mentioned would be impossible to discover, since the legal expenses of the enterprise would lead to the said friend having to cut the very tail from his coat before he would get clear of the lawyers.

“Nevertheless,” added Chichikov, “seeing that you are so hard pressed for money, and that I am so interested in the matter, I feel moved to advance you—well, to advance you such a trifle as would scarcely be worth mentioning.”

“But how much is it?” asked Plushkin eagerly, and with his hands trembling like quicksilver.

“Twenty-five kopecks per soul.”

“What? In ready money?”

“Yes—in money down.”

“Nevertheless, consider my poverty, dear friend, and make it FORTY kopecks per soul.”

“Venerable sir, would that I could pay you not merely forty kopecks, but five hundred roubles. I should be only too delighted if that were possible, since I perceive that you, an aged and respected gentleman, are suffering for your own goodness of heart.”

“By God, that is true, that is true.” Plushkin hung his head, and wagged it feebly from side to side. “Yes, all that I have done I have done purely out of kindness.”

“See how instantaneously I have divined your nature! By now it will have become clear to you why it is impossible for me to pay you five hundred roubles per runaway soul: for by now you will have gathered the fact that I am not sufficiently rich. Nevertheless, I am ready to add another five kopecks, and so to make it that each runaway serf shall cost me, in all, thirty kopecks.”

“As you please, dear sir. Yet stretch another point, and throw in another two kopecks.”

“Pardon me, but I cannot. How many runaway serfs did you say that you possess? Seventy?”

“No; seventy-eight.”

“Seventy-eight souls at thirty kopecks each will amount to—to—” only for a moment did our hero halt, since he was strong in his arithmetic, “—will amount to twenty-four roubles, ninety-six kopecks.” With that he requested Plushkin to make out the receipt, and then handed him the money. Plushkin took it in both hands, bore it to a bureau with as much caution as though he were carrying a liquid which might at any moment splash him in the face, and, arrived at the bureau, and glancing round once more, carefully packed the cash in one of his money bags, where, doubtless, it was destined to lie buried until, to the intense joy of his daughters and his son-in-law (and, perhaps, of the captain who claimed kinship with him), he should himself receive burial at the hands of Fathers Carp and Polycarp, the two priests attached to his village. Lastly, the money concealed, Plushkin re-seated himself in the armchair, and seemed at a loss for further material for conversation.

“Are you thinking of starting?” at length he inquired, on seeing Chichikov making a trifling movement, though the movement was only to extract from his pocket a handkerchief. Nevertheless the question reminded Chichikov that there was no further excuse for lingering. “Yes, I must be going,” he said as he took his hat.

“Then what about the tea?”

“Thank you, I will have some on my next visit.”

“What? Even though I have just ordered the samovar to be got ready? Well, well! I myself do not greatly care for tea, for I think it an expensive beverage. Moreover, the price of sugar has risen terribly.” “Proshka!” he then shouted. “The samovar will not be needed. Return the sugar to Mavra, and tell her to put it back again. But no. Bring the sugar here, and I will put it back.” “Good-bye, dear sir,” finally he added to Chichikov. “May the Lord bless you! Hand that letter to the President of the Council, and let him read it. Yes, he is an old friend of mine. We knew one another as schoolfellows.”

With that this strange phenomenon, this withered old man, escorted his guest to the gates of the courtyard, and, after the guest had departed, ordered the gates to be closed, made the round of the outbuildings for the purpose of ascertaining whether the numerous watchmen were at their posts, peered into the kitchen (where, under the pretence of seeing whether his servants were being properly fed, he made a light meal of cabbage soup and gruel), rated the said servants soundly for their thievishness and general bad behaviour, and then returned to his room. Meditating in solitude, he fell to thinking how best he could contrive to recompense his guest for the latter's measureless benevolence. “I will present him,” he thought to himself, “with a watch. It is a good silver article—not one of those cheap metal affairs; and though it has suffered some damage, he can easily get that put right. A young man always needs to give a watch to his betrothed.” “No,” he added after further thought. “I will leave him the watch in my will, as a keepsake.”

Meanwhile our hero was bowling along in high spirit. Such an unexpected acquisition both of dead souls and of runaway serfs had come as a windfall. Even before reaching Plushkin's village he had had a presentiment that he would do successful business there, but not business of such preeminent profitableness as had actually resulted. As he proceeded he whistled, hummed with hand placed trumpetwise to his mouth, and ended by bursting into a burst of melody so striking that Selifan, after listening for a while, nodded his head and exclaimed, “My word, but the master CAN sing!”

By the time they reached the town darkness had fallen, and changed the character of the scene. The britchka bounded over the cobblestones, and at length turned into the hostelry's courtyard, where the travellers were met by Petrushka. With one hand holding back the tails of his coat (which he never liked to see fly apart), the valet assisted his master to alight. The waiter ran out with candle in hand and napkin on shoulder. Whether or not Petrushka was glad to see the barin return it is impossible to say, but at all events he exchanged a wink with Selifan, and his ordinarily morose exterior seemed momentarily to brighten.

“Then you have been travelling far, sir?” said the waiter, as he lit the way upstarts.

“Yes,” said Chichikov. “What has happened here in the meanwhile?”

“Nothing, sir,” replied the waiter, bowing, “except that last night there arrived a military lieutenant. He has got room number sixteen.”

“A lieutenant?”

“Yes. He came from Riazan, driving three grey horses.”

On entering his room, Chichikov clapped his hand to his nose, and asked his valet why he had never had the windows opened.

“But I did have them opened,” replied Petrushka. Nevertheless this was a lie, as Chichikov well knew, though he was too tired to contest the point. After ordering and consuming a light supper of sucking pig, he undressed, plunged beneath the bedclothes, and sank into the profound slumber which comes only to such fortunate folk as are troubled neither with mosquitoes nor fleas nor excessive activity of brain.





CHAPTER VII


When Chichikov awoke he stretched himself and realised that he had slept well. For a moment or two he lay on his back, and then suddenly clapped his hands at the recollection that he was now owner of nearly four hundred souls. At once he leapt out of bed without so much as glancing at his face in the mirror, though, as a rule, he had much solicitude for his features, and especially for his chin, of which he would make the most when in company with friends, and more particularly should any one happen to enter while he was engaged in the process of shaving. “Look how round my chin is!” was his usual formula. On the present occasion, however, he looked neither at chin nor at any other feature, but at once donned his flower-embroidered slippers of morroco leather (the kind of slippers in which, thanks to the Russian love for a dressing-gowned existence, the town of Torzhok does such a huge trade), and, clad only in a meagre shirt, so far forgot his elderliness and dignity as to cut a couple of capers after the fashion of a Scottish highlander—alighting neatly, each time, on the flat of his heels. Only when he had done that did he proceed to business. Planting himself before his dispatch-box, he rubbed his hands with a satisfaction worthy of an incorruptible rural magistrate when adjourning for luncheon; after which he extracted from the receptacle a bundle of papers. These he had decided not to deposit with a lawyer, for the reason that he would hasten matters, as well as save expense, by himself framing and fair-copying the necessary deeds of indenture; and since he was thoroughly acquainted with the necessary terminology, he proceeded to inscribe in large characters the date, and then in smaller ones, his name and rank. By two o'clock the whole was finished, and as he looked at the sheets of names representing bygone peasants who had ploughed, worked at handicrafts, cheated their masters, fetched, carried, and got drunk (though SOME of them may have behaved well), there came over him a strange, unaccountable sensation. To his eye each list of names seemed to possess a character of its own; and even individual peasants therein seemed to have taken on certain qualities peculiar to themselves. For instance, to the majority of Madame Korobotchka's serfs there were appended nicknames and other additions; Plushkin's list was distinguished by a conciseness of exposition which had led to certain of the items being represented merely by Christian name, patronymic, and a couple of dots; and Sobakevitch's list was remarkable for its amplitude and circumstantiality, in that not a single peasant had such of his peculiar characteristics omitted as that the deceased had been “excellent at joinery,” or “sober and ready to pay attention to his work.” Also, in Sobakevitch's list there was recorded who had been the father and the mother of each of the deceased, and how those parents had behaved themselves. Only against the name of a certain Thedotov was there inscribed: “Father unknown, Mother the maidservant Kapitolina, Morals and Honesty good.” These details communicated to the document a certain air of freshness, they seemed to connote that the peasants in question had lived but yesterday. As Chichikov scanned the list he felt softened in spirit, and said with a sigh: “My friends, what a concourse of you is here! How did you all pass your lives, my brethren? And how did you all come to depart hence?” As he spoke his eyes halted at one name in particular—that of the same Peter Saveliev Neuvazhai Korito who had once been the property of the window Korobotchka. Once more he could not help exclaiming: “What a series of titles! They occupy a whole line! Peter Saveliev, I wonder whether you were an artisan or a plain muzhik. Also, I wonder how you came to meet your end; whether in a tavern, or whether through going to sleep in the middle of the road and being run over by a train of waggons. Again, I see the name, ‘Probka Stepan, carpenter, very sober.’ That must be the hero of whom the Guards would have been so glad to get hold. How well I can imagine him tramping the country with an axe in his belt and his boots on his shoulder, and living on a few groats'-worth of bread and dried fish per day, and taking home a couple of half-rouble pieces in his purse, and sewing the notes into his breeches, or stuffing them into his boots! In what manner came you by your end, Probka Stepan? Did you, for good wages, mount a scaffold around the cupola of the village church, and, climbing thence to the cross above, miss your footing on a beam, and fall headlong with none at hand but Uncle Michai—the good uncle who, scratching the back of his neck, and muttering, ‘Ah, Vania, for once you have been too clever!’ straightway lashed himself to a rope, and took your place? ‘Maksim Teliatnikov, shoemaker.’ A shoemaker, indeed? ‘As drunk as a shoemaker,’ says the proverb. I know what you were like, my friend. If you wish, I will tell you your whole history. You were apprenticed to a German, who fed you and your fellows at a common table, thrashed you with a strap, kept you indoors whenever you had made a mistake, and spoke of you in uncomplimentary terms to his wife and friends. At length, when your apprenticeship was over, you said to yourself, ‘I am going to set up on my own account, and not just to scrape together a kopeck here and a kopeck there, as the Germans do, but to grow rich quick.’ Hence you took a shop at a high rent, bespoke a few orders, and set to work to buy up some rotten leather out of which you could make, on each pair of boots, a double profit. But those boots split within a fortnight, and brought down upon your head dire showers of maledictions; with the result that gradually your shop grew empty of customers, and you fell to roaming the streets and exclaiming, ‘The world is a very poor place indeed! A Russian cannot make a living for German competition.’ Well, well! ‘Elizabeta Vorobei!’ But that is a WOMAN'S name! How comes SHE to be on the list? That villain Sobakevitch must have sneaked her in without my knowing it.”

“‘Grigori Goiezhai-ne-Doiedesh,’” he went on. “What sort of a man were YOU, I wonder? Were you a carrier who, having set up a team of three horses and a tilt waggon, left your home, your native hovel, for ever, and departed to cart merchandise to market? Was it on the highway that you surrendered your soul to God, or did your friends first marry you to some fat, red-faced soldier's daughter; after which your harness and team of rough, but sturdy, horses caught a highwayman's fancy, and you, lying on your pallet, thought things over until, willy-nilly, you felt that you must get up and make for the tavern, thereafter blundering into an icehole? Ah, our peasant of Russia! Never do you welcome death when it comes!”

“And you, my friends?” continued Chichikov, turning to the sheet whereon were inscribed the names of Plushkin's absconded serfs. “Although you are still alive, what is the good of you? You are practically dead. Whither, I wonder, have your fugitive feet carried you? Did you fare hardly at Plushkin's, or was it that your natural inclinations led you to prefer roaming the wilds and plundering travellers? Are you, by this time, in gaol, or have you taken service with other masters for the tillage of their lands? ‘Eremei Kariakin, Nikita Volokita and Anton Volokita (son of the foregoing).’ To judge from your surnames, you would seem to have been born gadabouts . ‘Popov, household serf.’ Probably you are an educated man, good Popov, and go in for polite thieving, as distinguished from the more vulgar cut-throat sort. In my mind's eye I seem to see a Captain of Rural Police challenging you for being without a passport; whereupon you stake your all upon a single throw. ‘To whom do you belong?’ asks the Captain, probably adding to his question a forcible expletive. ‘To such and such a landowner,’ stoutly you reply. ‘And what are you doing here?’ continues the Captain. ‘I have just received permission to go and earn my obrok,’ is your fluent explanation. ‘Then where is your passport?’ ‘At Miestchanin Pimenov's.’ ‘Pimenov's? Then are you Pimenov himself?’ ‘Yes, I am Pimenov himself.’ ‘He has given you his passport?’ ‘No, he has not given me his passport.’ ‘Come, come!’ shouts the Captain with another forcible expletive. ‘You are lying!’ ‘No, I am not,’ is your dogged reply. ‘It is only that last night I could not return him his passport, because I came home late; so I handed it to Antip Prochorov, the bell-ringer, for him to take care of.’ ‘Bell-ringer, indeed! Then HE gave you a passport?’ ‘No; I did not receive a passport from him either.’ ‘What?’—and here the Captain shouts another expletive—‘How dare you keep on lying? Where is YOUR OWN passport?’ ‘I had one all right,’ you reply cunningly, ‘but must have dropped it somewhere on the road as I came along.’ ‘And what about that soldier's coat?’ asks the Captain with an impolite addition. ‘Whence did you get it? And what of the priest's cashbox and copper money?’” ‘About them I know nothing,’ you reply doggedly. ‘Never at any time have I committed a theft.’ ‘Then how is it that the coat was found at your place?’ ‘I do not know. Probably some one else put it there.’ ‘You rascal, you rascal!’ shouts the Captain, shaking his head, and closing in upon you. ‘Put the leg-irons upon him, and off with him to prison!’ ‘With pleasure,’ you reply as, taking a snuff-box from your pocket, you offer a pinch to each of the two gendarmes who are manacling you, while also inquiring how long they have been discharged from the army, and in what wars they may have served. And in prison you remain until your case comes on, when the justice orders you to be removed from Tsarev-Kokshaika to such and such another prison, and a second justice orders you to be transferred thence to Vesiegonsk or somewhere else, and you go flitting from gaol to gaol, and saying each time, as you eye your new habitation, ‘The last place was a good deal cleaner than this one is, and one could play babki there, and stretch one's legs, and see a little society.’ “‘Abakum Thirov,’” Chichikov went on after a pause. “What of YOU, brother? Where, and in what capacity, are YOU disporting yourself? Have you gone to the Volga country, and become bitten with the life of freedom, and joined the fishermen of the river?” Here, breaking off, Chichikov relapsed into silent meditation. Of what was he thinking as he sat there? Was he thinking of the fortunes of Abakum Thirov, or was he meditating as meditates every Russian when his thoughts once turn to the joys of an emancipated existence?

“Ah, well!” he sighed, looking at his watch. “It has now gone twelve o'clock. Why have I so forgotten myself? There is still much to be done, yet I go shutting myself up and letting my thoughts wander! What a fool I am!” So saying, he exchanged his Scottish costume (of a shirt and nothing else) for attire of a more European nature; after which he pulled tight the waistcoat over his ample stomach, sprinkled himself with eau-de-Cologne, tucked his papers under his arm, took his fur cap, and set out for the municipal offices, for the purpose of completing the transfer of souls. The fact that he hurried along was not due to a fear of being late (seeing that the President of the Local Council was an intimate acquaintance of his, as well as a functionary who could shorten or prolong an interview at will, even as Homer's Zeus was able to shorten or to prolong a night or a day, whenever it became necessary to put an end to the fighting of his favourite heroes, or to enable them to join battle), but rather to a feeling that he would like to have the affair concluded as quickly as possible, seeing that, throughout, it had been an anxious and difficult business. Also, he could not get rid of the idea that his souls were unsubstantial things, and that therefore, under the circumstances, his shoulders had better be relieved of their load with the least possible delay. Pulling on his cinnamon-coloured, bear-lined overcoat as he went, he had just stepped thoughtfully into the street when he collided with a gentleman dressed in a similar coat and an ear-lappeted fur cap. Upon that the gentleman uttered an exclamation. Behold, it was Manilov! At once the friends became folded in a strenuous embrace, and remained so locked for fully five minutes. Indeed, the kisses exchanged were so vigorous that both suffered from toothache for the greater portion of the day. Also, Manilov's delight was such that only his nose and lips remained visible—the eyes completely disappeared. Afterwards he spent about a quarter of an hour in holding Chichikov's hand and chafing it vigorously. Lastly, he, in the most pleasant and exquisite terms possible, intimated to his friend that he had just been on his way to embrace Paul Ivanovitch; and upon this followed a compliment of the kind which would more fittingly have been addressed to a lady who was being asked to accord a partner the favour of a dance. Chichikov had opened his mouth to reply—though even HE felt at a loss how to acknowledge what had just been said—when Manilov cut him short by producing from under his coat a roll of paper tied with red riband.

“What have you there?” asked Chichikov.

“The list of my souls.”

“Ah!” And as Chichikov unrolled the document and ran his eye over it he could not but marvel at the elegant neatness with which it had been inscribed.

“It is a beautiful piece of writing,” he said. “In fact, there will be no need to make a copy of it. Also, it has a border around its edge! Who worked that exquisite border?”

“Do not ask me,” said Manilov.

“Did YOU do it?”

“No; my wife.”

“Dear, dear!” Chichikov cried. “To think that I should have put her to so much trouble!”

“NOTHING could be too much trouble where Paul Ivanovitch is concerned.”

Chichikov bowed his acknowledgements. Next, on learning that he was on his way to the municipal offices for the purpose of completing the transfer, Manilov expressed his readiness to accompany him; wherefore the pair linked arm in arm and proceeded together. Whenever they encountered a slight rise in the ground—even the smallest unevenness or difference of level—Manilov supported Chichikov with such energy as almost to lift him off his feet, while accompanying the service with a smiling implication that not if HE could help it should Paul Ivanovitch slip or fall. Nevertheless this conduct appeared to embarrass Chichikov, either because he could not find any fitting words of gratitude or because he considered the proceeding tiresome; and it was with a sense of relief that he debouched upon the square where the municipal offices—a large, three-storied building of a chalky whiteness which probably symbolised the purity of the souls engaged within—were situated. No other building in the square could vie with them in size, seeing that the remaining edifices consisted only of a sentry-box, a shelter for two or three cabmen, and a long hoarding—the latter adorned with the usual bills, posters, and scrawls in chalk and charcoal. At intervals, from the windows of the second and third stories of the municipal offices, the incorruptible heads of certain of the attendant priests of Themis would peer quickly forth, and as quickly disappear again—probably for the reason that a superior official had just entered the room. Meanwhile the two friends ascended the staircase—nay, almost flew up it, since, longing to get rid of Manilov's ever-supporting arm, Chichikov hastened his steps, and Manilov kept darting forward to anticipate any possible failure on the part of his companion's legs. Consequently the pair were breathless when they reached the first corridor. In passing it may be remarked that neither corridors nor rooms evinced any of that cleanliness and purity which marked the exterior of the building, for such attributes were not troubled about within, and anything that was dirty remained so, and donned no meritricious, purely external, disguise. It was as though Themis received her visitors in négligéand a dressing-gown. The author would also give a description of the various offices through which our hero passed, were it not that he (the author) stands in awe of such legal haunts. Approaching the first desk which he happened to encounter, Chichikov inquired of the two young officials who were seated at it whether they would kindly tell him where business relating to serf-indenture was transacted.

“Of what nature, precisely, IS your business?” countered one of the youthful officials as he turned himself round.

“I desire to make an application.”

“In connection with a purchase?”

“Yes. But, as I say, I should like first to know where I can find the desk devoted to such business. Is it here or elsewhere?”

“You must state what it is you have bought, and for how much. THEN we shall be happy to give you the information.”

Chichikov perceived that the officials' motive was merely one of curiosity, as often happens when young tchinovniks desire to cut a more important and imposing figure than is rightfully theirs.

“Look here, young sirs,” he said. “I know for a fact that all serf business, no matter to what value, is transacted at one desk alone. Consequently I again request you to direct me to that desk. Of course, if you do not know your business I can easily ask some one else.”

To this the tchinovniks made no reply beyond pointing towards a corner of the room where an elderly man appeared to be engaged in sorting some papers. Accordingly Chichikov and Manilov threaded their way in his direction through the desks; whereupon the elderly man became violently busy.

“Would you mind telling me,” said Chichikov, bowing, “whether this is the desk for serf affairs?”

The elderly man raised his eyes, and said stiffly:

“This is NOT the desk for serf affairs.”

“Where is it, then?”

“In the Serf Department.”

“And where might the Serf Department be?”

“In charge of Ivan Antonovitch.”

“And where is Ivan Antonovitch?”

The elderly man pointed to another corner of the room; whither Chichikov and Manilov next directed their steps. As they advanced, Ivan Antonovitch cast an eye backwards and viewed them askance. Then, with renewed ardour, he resumed his work of writing.

“Would you mind telling me,” said Chichikov, bowing, “whether this is the desk for serf affairs?”

It appeared as though Ivan Antonovitch had not heard, so completely did he bury himself in his papers and return no reply. Instantly it became plain that HE at least was of an age of discretion, and not one of your jejune chatterboxes and harum-scarums; for, although his hair was still thick and black, he had long ago passed his fortieth year. His whole face tended towards the nose—it was what, in common parlance, is known as a “pitcher-mug.”

“Would you mind telling me,” repeated Chichikov, “whether this is the desk for serf affairs?”

“It is that,” said Ivan Antonovitch, again lowering his jug-shaped jowl, and resuming his writing.

“Then I should like to transact the following business. From various landowners in this canton I have purchased a number of peasants for transfer. Here is the purchase list, and it needs but to be registered.”

“Have you also the vendors here?”

“Some of them, and from the rest I have obtained powers of attorney.”

“And have you your statement of application?”

“Yes. I desire—indeed, it is necessary for me so to do—to hasten matters a little. Could the affair, therefore, be carried through to-day?”

“To-day? Oh, dear no!” said Ivan Antonovitch. “Before that can be done you must furnish me with further proofs that no impediments exist.”

“Then, to expedite matters, let me say that Ivan Grigorievitch, the President of the Council, is a very intimate friend of mine.”

“Possibly,” said Ivan Antonovitch without enthusiasm. “But Ivan Grigorievitch alone will not do—it is customary to have others as well.”

“Yes, but the absence of others will not altogether invalidate the transaction. I too have been in the service, and know how things can be done.”

“You had better go and see Ivan Grigorievitch,” said Ivan Antonovitch more mildly. “Should he give you an order addressed to whom it may concern, we shall soon be able to settle the matter.”

Upon that Chichikov pulled from his pocket a paper, and laid it before Ivan Antonovitch. At once the latter covered it with a book. Chichikov again attempted to show it to him, but, with a movement of his head, Ivan Antonovitch signified that that was unnecessary.

“A clerk,” he added, “will now conduct you to Ivan Grigorievitch's room.”

Upon that one of the toilers in the service of Themis—a zealot who had offered her such heartfelt sacrifice that his coat had burst at the elbows and lacked a lining—escorted our friends (even as Virgil had once escorted Dante) to the apartment of the Presence. In this sanctum were some massive armchairs, a table laden with two or three fat books, and a large looking-glass. Lastly, in (apparently) sunlike isolation, there was seated at the table the President. On arriving at the door of the apartment, our modern Virgil seemed to have become so overwhelmed with awe that, without daring even to intrude a foot, he turned back, and, in so doing, once more exhibited a back as shiny as a mat, and having adhering to it, in one spot, a chicken's feather. As soon as the two friends had entered the hall of the Presence they perceived that the President was NOT alone, but, on the contrary, had seated by his side Sobakevitch, whose form had hitherto been concealed by the intervening mirror. The newcomers' entry evoked sundry exclamations and the pushing back of a pair of Government chairs as the voluminous-sleeved Sobakevitch rose into view from behind the looking-glass. Chichikov the President received with an embrace, and for a while the hall of the Presence resounded with osculatory salutations as mutually the pair inquired after one another's health. It seemed that both had lately had a touch of that pain under the waistband which comes of a sedentary life. Also, it seemed that the President had just been conversing with Sobakevitch on the subject of sales of souls, since he now proceeded to congratulate Chichikov on the same—a proceeding which rather embarrassed our hero, seeing that Manilov and Sobakevitch, two of the vendors, and persons with whom he had bargained in the strictest privacy, were now confronting one another direct. However, Chichikov duly thanked the President, and then, turning to Sobakevitch, inquired after HIS health.

“Thank God, I have nothing to complain of,” replied Sobakevitch: which was true enough, seeing that a piece of iron would have caught cold and taken to sneezing sooner than would that uncouthly fashioned landowner.

“Ah, yes; you have always had good health, have you not?” put in the President. “Your late father was equally strong.”

“Yes, he even went out bear hunting alone,” replied Sobakevitch.

“I should think that you too could worst a bear if you were to try a tussle with him,” rejoined the President.

“Oh no,” said Sobakevitch. “My father was a stronger man than I am.” Then with a sigh the speaker added: “But nowadays there are no such men as he. What is even a life like mine worth?”

“Then you do not have a comfortable time of it?” exclaimed the President.

“No; far from it,” rejoined Sobakevitch, shaking his head. “Judge for yourself, Ivan Grigorievitch. I am fifty years old, yet never in my life had been ill, except for an occasional carbuncle or boil. That is not a good sign. Sooner or later I shall have to pay for it.” And he relapsed into melancholy.

“Just listen to the fellow!” was Chichikov's and the President's joint inward comment. “What on earth has HE to complain of?”

“I have a letter for you, Ivan Grigorievitch,” went on Chichikov aloud as he produced from his pocket Plushkin's epistle.

“From whom?” inquired the President. Having broken the seal, he exclaimed: “Why, it is from Plushkin! To think that HE is still alive! What a strange world it is! He used to be such a nice fellow, and now—”

“And now he is a cur,” concluded Sobakevitch, “as well as a miser who starves his serfs to death.”

“Allow me a moment,” said the President. Then he read the letter through. When he had finished he added: “Yes, I am quite ready to act as Plushkin's attorney. When do you wish the purchase deeds to be registered, Monsieur Chichikov—now or later?”

“Now, if you please,” replied Chichikov. “Indeed, I beg that, if possible, the affair may be concluded to-day, since to-morrow I wish to leave the town. I have brought with me both the forms of indenture and my statement of application.”

“Very well. Nevertheless we cannot let you depart so soon. The indentures shall be completed to-day, but you must continue your sojourn in our midst. I will issue the necessary orders at once.”

So saying, he opened the door into the general office, where the clerks looked like a swarm of bees around a honeycomb (if I may liken affairs of Government to such an article?).

“Is Ivan Antonovitch here?” asked the President.

“Yes,” replied a voice from within.

“Then send him here.”

Upon that the pitcher-faced Ivan Antonovitch made his appearance in the doorway, and bowed.

“Take these indentures, Ivan Antonovitch,” said the President, “and see that they—”

“But first I would ask you to remember,” put in Sobakevitch, “that witnesses ought to be in attendance—not less than two on behalf of either party. Let us, therefore, send for the Public Prosecutor, who has little to do, and has even that little done for him by his chief clerk, Zolotucha. The Inspector of the Medical Department is also a man of leisure, and likely to be at home—if he has not gone out to a card party. Others also there are—all men who cumber the ground for nothing.”

“Quite so, quite so,” agreed the President, and at once dispatched a clerk to fetch the persons named.

“Also,” requested Chichikov, “I should be glad if you would send for the accredited representative of a certain lady landowner with whom I have done business. He is the son of a Father Cyril, and a clerk in your offices.”

“Certainly we shall call him here,” replied the President. “Everything shall be done to meet your convenience, and I forbid you to present any of our officials with a gratuity. That is a special request on my part. No friend of mine ever pays a copper.”

With that he gave Ivan Antonovitch the necessary instructions; and though they scarcely seemed to meet with that functionary's approval, upon the President the purchase deeds had evidently produced an excellent impression, more especially since the moment when he had perceived the sum total to amount to nearly a hundred thousand roubles. For a moment or two he gazed into Chichikov's eyes with an expression of profound satisfaction. Then he said:

“Well done, Paul Ivanovitch! You have indeed made a nice haul!”

“That is so,” replied Chichikov.

“Excellent business! Yes, excellent business!”

“I, too, conceive that I could not well have done better. The truth is that never until a man has driven home the piles of his life's structure upon a lasting bottom, instead of upon the wayward chimeras of youth, will his aims in life assume a definite end.” And, that said, Chichikov went on to deliver himself of a very telling indictment of Liberalism and our modern young men. Yet in his words there seemed to lurk a certain lack of conviction. Somehow he seemed secretly to be saying to himself, “My good sir, you are talking the most absolute rubbish, and nothing but rubbish.” Nor did he even throw a glance at Sobakevitch and Manilov. It was as though he were uncertain what he might not encounter in their expression. Yet he need not have been afraid. Never once did Sobakevitch's face move a muscle, and, as for Manilov, he was too much under the spell of Chichikov's eloquence to do aught beyond nod his approval at intervals, and strike the kind of attitude which is assumed by lovers of music when a lady singer has, in rivalry of an accompanying violin, produced a note whereof the shrillness would exceed even the capacity of a bird's throstle.

“But why not tell Ivan Grigorievitch precisely what you have bought?” inquired Sobakevitch of Chichikov. “And why, Ivan Grigorievitch, do YOU not ask Monsieur Chichikov precisely what his purchases have consisted of? What a splendid lot of serfs, to be sure! I myself have sold him my wheelwright, Michiev.”

“What? You have sold him Michiev?” exclaimed the President. “I know the man well. He is a splendid craftsman, and, on one occasion, made me a drozhki . Only, only—well, lately didn't you tell me that he is dead?”

“That Michiev is dead?” re-echoed Sobakevitch, coming perilously near to laughing. “Oh dear no! That was his brother. Michiev himself is very much alive, and in even better health than he used to be. Any day he could knock you up a britchka such as you could not procure even in Moscow. However, he is now bound to work for only one master.”

“Indeed a splendid craftsman!” repeated the President. “My only wonder is that you can have brought yourself to part with him.”

“Then think you that Michiev is the ONLY serf with whom I have parted? Nay, for I have parted also with Probka Stepan, my carpenter, with Milushkin, my bricklayer, and with Teliatnikov, my bootmaker. Yes, the whole lot I have sold.”

And to the President's inquiry why he had so acted, seeing that the serfs named were all skilled workers and indispensable to a household, Sobakevitch replied that a mere whim had led him to do so, and thus the sale had owed its origin to a piece of folly. Then he hung his head as though already repenting of his rash act, and added:

“Although a man of grey hairs, I have not yet learned wisdom.”

“But,” inquired the President further, “how comes it about, Paul Ivanovitch, that you have purchased peasants apart from land? Is it for transferment elsewhere that you need them?”

“Yes.”

“Very well, then. That is quite another matter. To what province of the country?”

“To the province of Kherson.”

“Indeed? That region contains some splendid land,” said the President; whereupon he proceeded to expatiate on the fertility of the Kherson pastures.

“And have you MUCH land there?” he continued.

“Yes; quite sufficient to accommodate the serfs whom I have purchased.”

“And is there a river on the estate or a lake?”

“Both.”

After this reply Chichikov involuntarily threw a glance at Sobakevitch; and though that landowner's face was as motionless as every other, the other seemed to detect in it: “You liar! Don't tell ME that you own both a river and a lake, as well as the land which you say you do.”

Whilst the foregoing conversation had been in progress, various witnesses had been arriving on the scene. They consisted of the constantly blinking Public Prosecutor, the Inspector of the Medical Department, and others—all, to quote Sobakevitch, “men who cumbered the ground for nothing.” With some of them, however, Chichikov was altogether unacquainted, since certain substitutes and supernumeraries had to be pressed into the service from among the ranks of the subordinate staff. There also arrived, in answer to the summons, not only the son of Father Cyril before mentioned, but also Father Cyril himself. Each such witness appended to his signature a full list of his dignities and qualifications: one man in printed characters, another in a flowing hand, a third in topsy-turvy characters of a kind never before seen in the Russian alphabet, and so forth. Meanwhile our friend Ivan Antonovitch comported himself with not a little address; and after the indentures had been signed, docketed, and registered, Chichikov found himself called upon to pay only the merest trifle in the way of Government percentage and fees for publishing the transaction in the Official Gazette. The reason of this was that the President had given orders that only half the usual charges were to be exacted from the present purchaser—the remaining half being somehow debited to the account of another applicant for serf registration.

“And now,” said Ivan Grigorievitch when all was completed, “we need only to wet the bargain.”

“For that too I am ready,” said Chichikov. “Do you but name the hour. If, in return for your most agreeable company, I were not to set a few champagne corks flying, I should be indeed in default.”

“But we are not going to let you charge yourself with anything whatsoever. WE must provide the champagne, for you are our guest, and it is for us—it is our duty, it is our bounden obligation—to entertain you. Look here, gentlemen. Let us adjourn to the house of the Chief of Police. He is the magician who needs but to wink when passing a fishmonger's or a wine merchant's. Not only shall we fare well at his place, but also we shall get a game of whist.”

To this proposal no one had any objection to offer, for the mere mention of the fish shop aroused the witnesses' appetite. Consequently, the ceremony being over, there was a general reaching for hats and caps. As the party were passing through the general office, Ivan Antonovitch whispered in Chichikov's ear, with a courteous inclination of his jug-shaped physiognomy:

“You have given a hundred thousand roubles for the serfs, but have paid ME only a trifle for my trouble.”

“Yes,” replied Chichikov with a similar whisper, “but what sort of serfs do you suppose them to be? They are a poor, useless lot, and not worth even half the purchase money.”

This gave Ivan Antonovitch to understand that the visitor was a man of strong character—a man from whom nothing more was to be expected.

“Why have you gone and purchased souls from Plushkin?” whispered Sobakevitch in Chichikov's other ear.

“Why did YOU go and add the woman Vorobei to your list?” retorted Chichikov.

“Vorobei? Who is Vorobei?”

“The woman ‘Elizabet’ Vorobei—‘Elizabet,’ not ‘Elizabeta?’”

“I added no such name,” replied Sobakevitch, and straightway joined the other guests.

At length the party arrived at the residence of the Chief of Police. The latter proved indeed a man of spells, for no sooner had he learnt what was afoot than he summoned a brisk young constable, whispered in his ear, adding laconically, “You understand, do you not?” and brought it about that, during the time that the guests were cutting for partners at whist in an adjoining room, the dining-table became laden with sturgeon, caviare, salmon, herrings, cheese, smoked tongue, fresh roe, and a potted variety of the same—all procured from the local fish market, and reinforced with additions from the host's own kitchen. The fact was that the worthy Chief of Police filled the office of a sort of father and general benefactor to the town, and that he moved among the citizens as though they constituted part and parcel of his own family, and watched over their shops and markets as though those establishments were merely his own private larder. Indeed, it would be difficult to say—so thoroughly did he perform his duties in this respect— whether the post most fitted him, or he the post. Matters were also so arranged that though his income more than doubled that of his predecessors, he had never lost the affection of his fellow townsmen. In particular did the tradesmen love him, since he was never above standing godfather to their children or dining at their tables. True, he had differences of opinion with them, and serious differences at that; but always these were skilfully adjusted by his slapping the offended ones jovially on the shoulder, drinking a glass of tea with them, promising to call at their houses and play a game of chess, asking after their belongings, and, should he learn that a child of theirs was ill, prescribing the proper medicine. In short, he bore the reputation of being a very good fellow.

On perceiving the feast to be ready, the host proposed that his guests should finish their whist after luncheon; whereupon all proceeded to the room whence for some time past an agreeable odour had been tickling the nostrils of those present, and towards the door of which Sobakevitch in particular had been glancing since the moment when he had caught sight of a huge sturgeon reposing on the sideboard. After a glassful of warm, olive-coloured vodka apiece—vodka of the tint to be seen only in the species of Siberian stone whereof seals are cut—the company applied themselves to knife-andfork work, and, in so doing, evinced their several characteristics and tastes. For instance, Sobakevitch, disdaining lesser trifles, tackled the large sturgeon, and, during the time that his fellow guests were eating minor comestibles, and drinking and talking, contrived to consume more than a quarter of the whole fish; so that, on the host remembering the creature, and, with fork in hand, leading the way in its direction and saying, “What, gentlemen, think you of this striking product of nature?” there ensued the discovery that of the said product of nature there remained little beyond the tail, while Sobakevitch, with an air as though at least HE had not eaten it, was engaged in plunging his fork into a much more diminutive piece of fish which happened to be resting on an adjacent platter. After his divorce from the sturgeon, Sobakevitch ate and drank no more, but sat frowning and blinking in an armchair.

Apparently the host was not a man who believed in sparing the wine, for the toasts drunk were innumerable. The first toast (as the reader may guess) was quaffed to the health of the new landowner of Kherson; the second to the prosperity of his peasants and their safe transferment; and the third to the beauty of his future wife—a compliment which brought to our hero's lips a flickering smile. Lastly, he received from the company a pressing, as well as an unanimous, invitation to extend his stay in town for at least another fortnight, and, in the meanwhile, to allow a wife to be found for him.

“Quite so,” agreed the President. “Fight us tooth and nail though you may, we intend to have you married. You have happened upon us by chance, and you shall have no reason to repent of it. We are in earnest on this subject.”

“But why should I fight you tooth and nail?” said Chichikov, smiling. “Marriage would not come amiss to me, were I but provided with a betrothed.”

“Then a betrothed you shall have. Why not? We will do as you wish.”

“Very well,” assented Chichikov.

“Bravo, bravo!” the company shouted. “Long live Paul Ivanovitch! Hurrah! Hurrah!” And with that every one approached to clink glasses with him, and he readily accepted the compliment, and accepted it many times in succession. Indeed, as the hours passed on, the hilarity of the company increased yet further, and more than once the President (a man of great urbanity when thoroughly in his cups) embraced the chief guest of the day with the heartfelt words, “My dearest fellow! My own most precious of friends!” Nay, he even started to crack his fingers, to dance around Chichikov's chair, and to sing snatches of a popular song. To the champagne succeeded Hungarian wine, which had the effect of still further heartening and enlivening the company. By this time every one had forgotten about whist, and given himself up to shouting and disputing. Every conceivable subject was discussed, including politics and military affairs; and in this connection guests voiced jejune opinions for the expression of which they would, at any other time, have soundly spanked their offspring. Chichikov, like the rest, had never before felt so gay, and, imagining himself really and truly to be a landowner of Kherson, spoke of various improvements in agriculture, of the three-field system of tillage , and of the beatific felicity of a union between two kindred souls. Also, he started to recite poetry to Sobakevitch, who blinked as he listened, for he greatly desired to go to sleep. At length the guest of the evening realised that matters had gone far enough, so begged to be given a lift home, and was accommodated with the Public Prosecutor's drozhki. Luckily the driver of the vehicle was a practised man at his work, for, while driving with one hand, he succeeded in leaning backwards and, with the other, holding Chichikov securely in his place. Arrived at the inn, our hero continued babbling awhile about a flaxen-haired damsel with rosy lips and a dimple in her right cheek, about villages of his in Kherson, and about the amount of his capital. Nay, he even issued seignorial instructions that Selifan should go and muster the peasants about to be transferred, and make a complete and detailed inventory of them. For a while Selifan listened in silence; then he left the room, and instructed Petrushka to help the barin to undress. As it happened, Chichikov's boots had no sooner been removed than he managed to perform the rest of his toilet without assistance, to roll on to the bed (which creaked terribly as he did so), and to sink into a sleep in every way worthy of a landowner of Kherson. Meanwhile Petrushka had taken his master's coat and trousers of bilberry-coloured check into the corridor; where, spreading them over a clothes' horse, he started to flick and to brush them, and to fill the whole corridor with dust. Just as he was about to replace them in his master's room he happened to glance over the railing of the gallery, and saw Selifan returning from the stable. Glances were exchanged, and in an instant the pair had arrived at an instinctive understanding—an understanding to the effect that the barin was sound asleep, and that therefore one might consider one's own pleasure a little. Accordingly Petrushka proceeded to restore the coat and trousers to their appointed places, and then descended the stairs; whereafter he and Selifan left the house together. Not a word passed between them as to the object of their expedition. On the contrary, they talked solely of extraneous subjects. Yet their walk did not take them far; it took them only to the other side of the street, and thence into an establishment which immediately confronted the inn. Entering a mean, dirty courtyard covered with glass, they passed thence into a cellar where a number of customers were seated around small wooden tables. What thereafter was done by Selifan and Petrushka God alone knows. At all events, within an hour's time they issued, arm in arm, and in profound silence, yet remaining markedly assiduous to one another, and ever ready to help one another around an awkward corner. Still linked together—never once releasing their mutual hold—they spent the next quarter of an hour in attempting to negotiate the stairs of the inn; but at length even that ascent had been mastered, and they proceeded further on their way. Halting before his mean little pallet, Petrushka stood awhile in thought. His difficulty was how best to assume a recumbent position. Eventually he lay down on his face, with his legs trailing over the floor; after which Selifan also stretched himself upon the pallet, with his head resting upon Petrushka's stomach, and his mind wholly oblivious of the fact that he ought not to have been sleeping there at all, but in the servant's quarters, or in the stable beside his horses. Scarcely a moment had passed before the pair were plunged in slumber and emitting the most raucous snores; to which their master (next door) responded with snores of a whistling and nasal order. Indeed, before long every one in the inn had followed their soothing example, and the hostelry lay plunged in complete restfulness. Only in the window of the room of the newly-arrived lieutenant from Riazan did a light remain burning. Evidently he was a devotee of boots, for he had purchased four pairs, and was now trying on a fifth. Several times he approached the bed with a view to taking off the boots and retiring to rest; but each time he failed, for the reason that the boots were so alluring in their make that he had no choice but to lift up first one foot, and then the other, for the purpose of scanning their elegant welts.





CHAPTER VIII


It was not long before Chichikov's purchases had become the talk of the town; and various were the opinions expressed as to whether or not it was expedient to procure peasants for transferment. Indeed such was the interest taken by certain citizens in the matter that they advised the purchaser to provide himself and his convoy with an escort, in order to ensure their safe arrival at the appointed destination; but though Chichikov thanked the donors of this advice for the same, and declared that he should be very glad, in case of need, to avail himself of it, he declared also that there was no real need for an escort, seeing that the peasants whom he had purchased were exceptionally peace-loving folk, and that, being themselves consenting parties to the transferment, they would undoubtedly prove in every way tractable. One particularly good result of this advertisement of his scheme was that he came to rank as neither more nor less than a millionaire. Consequently, much as the inhabitants had liked our hero in the first instance (as seen in Chapter I.), they now liked him more than ever. As a matter of fact, they were citizens of an exceptionally quiet, good-natured, easy-going disposition; and some of them were even well-educated. For instance, the President of the Local Council could recite the whole of Zhukovski's LUDMILLA by heart, and give such an impressive rendering of the passage “The pine forest was asleep and the valley at rest” (as well as of the exclamation “Phew!”) that one felt, as he did so, that the pine forest and the valley really WERE as he described them. The effect was also further heightened by the manner in which, at such moments, he assumed the most portentous frown. For his part, the Postmaster went in more for philosophy, and diligently perused such works as Young's Night Thoughts, and Eckharthausen's A Key to the Mysteries of Nature; of which latter work he would make copious extracts, though no one had the slightest notion what they referred to. For the rest, he was a witty, florid little individual, and much addicted to a practice of what he called “embellishing” whatsoever he had to say—a feat which he performed with the aid of such by-the-way phrases as “my dear sir,” “my good So-and-So,” “you know,” “you understand,” “you may imagine,” “relatively speaking,” “for instance,” and “et cetera”; of which phrases he would add sackfuls to his speech. He could also “embellish” his words by the simple expedient of half-closing, half-winking one eye; which trick communicated to some of his satirical utterances quite a mordant effect. Nor were his colleagues a wit inferior to him in enlightenment. For instance, one of them made a regular practice of reading Karamzin, another of conning the Moscow Gazette, and a third of never looking at a book at all. Likewise, although they were the sort of men to whom, in their more intimate movements, their wives would very naturally address such nicknames as “Toby Jug,” “Marmot,” “Fatty,” “Pot Belly,” “Smutty,” “Kiki,” and “Buzz-Buzz,” they were men also of good heart, and very ready to extend their hospitality and their friendship when once a guest had eaten of their bread and salt, or spent an evening in their company. Particularly, therefore, did Chichikov earn these good folk's approval with his taking methods and qualities—so much so that the expression of that approval bid fair to make it difficult for him to quit the town, seeing that, wherever he went, the one phrase dinned into his ears was “Stay another week with us, Paul Ivanovitch.” In short, he ceased to be a free agent. But incomparably more striking was the impression (a matter for unbounded surprise!) which he produced upon the ladies. Properly to explain this phenomenon I should need to say a great deal about the ladies themselves, and to describe in the most vivid of colours their social intercourse and spiritual qualities. Yet this would be a difficult thing for me to do, since, on the one hand, I should be hampered by my boundless respect for the womenfolk of all Civil Service officials, and, on the other hand—well, simply by the innate arduousness of the task. The ladies of N. were—But no, I cannot do it; my heart has already failed me. Come, come! The ladies of N. were distinguished for—But it is of no use; somehow my pen seems to refuse to move over the paper—it seems to be weighted as with a plummet of lead. Very well. That being so, I will merely say a word or two concerning the most prominent tints on the feminine palette of N.—merely a word or two concerning the outward appearance of its ladies, and a word or two concerning their more superficial characteristics. The ladies of N. were pre-eminently what is known as “presentable.” Indeed, in that respect they might have served as a model to the ladies of many another town. That is to say, in whatever pertained to “tone,” etiquette, the intricacies of decorum, and strict observance of the prevailing mode, they surpassed even the ladies of Moscow and St. Petersburg, seeing that they dressed with taste, drove about in carriages in the latest fashions, and never went out without the escort of a footman in gold-laced livery. Again, they looked upon a visiting card—even upon a make-shift affair consisting of an ace of diamonds or a two of clubs— as a sacred thing; so sacred that on one occasion two closely related ladies who had also been closely attached friends were known to fall out with one another over the mere fact of an omission to return a social call! Yes, in spite of the best efforts of husbands and kinsfolk to reconcile the antagonists, it became clear that, though all else in the world might conceivably be possible, never could the hatchet be buried between ladies who had quarrelled over a neglected visit. Likewise strenuous scenes used to take place over questions of precedence—scenes of a kind which had the effect of inspiring husbands to great and knightly ideas on the subject of protecting the fair. True, never did a duel actually take place, since all the husbands were officials belonging to the Civil Service; but at least a given combatant would strive to heap contumely upon his rival, and, as we all know, that is a resource which may prove even more effectual than a duel. As regards morality, the ladies of N. were nothing if not censorious, and would at once be fired with virtuous indignation when they heard of a case of vice or seduction. Nay, even to mere frailty they would award the lash without mercy. On the other hand, should any instance of what they called “third personism” occur among THEIR OWN circle, it was always kept dark—not a hint of what was going on being allowed to transpire, and even the wronged husband holding himself ready, should he meet with, or hear of, the “third person,” to quote, in a mild and rational manner, the proverb, “Whom concerns it that a friend should consort with friend?” In addition, I may say that, like most of the female world of St. Petersburg, the ladies of N. were pre-eminently careful and refined in their choice of words and phrases. Never did a lady say, “I blew my nose,” or “I perspired,” or “I spat.” No, it had to be, “I relieved my nose through the expedient of wiping it with my handkerchief,” and so forth. Again, to say, “This glass, or this plate, smells badly,” was forbidden. No, not even a hint to such an effect was to be dropped. Rather, the proper phrase, in such a case, was “This glass, or this plate, is not behaving very well,”—or some such formula.

In fact, to refine the Russian tongue the more thoroughly, something like half the words in it were cut out: which circumstance necessitated very frequent recourse to the tongue of France, since the same words, if spoken in French, were another matter altogether, and one could use even blunter ones than the ones originally objected to.

So much for the ladies of N., provided that one confines one's observations to the surface; yet hardly need it be said that, should one penetrate deeper than that, a great deal more would come to light. At the same time, it is never a very safe proceeding to peer deeply into the hearts of ladies; wherefore, restricting ourselves to the foregoing superficialities, let us proceed further on our way.

Hitherto the ladies had paid Chichikov no particular attention, though giving him full credit for his gentlemanly and urbane demeanour; but from the moment that there arose rumours of his being a millionaire other qualities of his began to be canvassed. Nevertheless, not ALL the ladies were governed by interested motives, since it is due to the term “millionaire” rather than to the character of the person who bears it, that the mere sound of the word exercises upon rascals, upon decent folk, and upon folk who are neither the one nor the other, an undeniable influence. A millionaire suffers from the disadvantage of everywhere having to behold meanness, including the sort of meanness which, though not actually based upon calculations of self-interest, yet runs after the wealthy man with smiles, and doffs his hat, and begs for invitations to houses where the millionaire is known to be going to dine. That a similar inclination to meanness seized upon the ladies of N. goes without saying; with the result that many a drawing-room heard it whispered that, if Chichikov was not exactly a beauty, at least he was sufficiently good-looking to serve for a husband, though he could have borne to have been a little more rotund and stout. To that there would be added scornful references to lean husbands, and hints that they resembled tooth-brushes rather than men—with many other feminine additions. Also, such crowds of feminine shoppers began to repair to the Bazaar as almost to constitute a crush, and something like a procession of carriages ensued, so long grew the rank of vehicles. For their part, the tradesmen had the joy of seeing highly priced dress materials which they had brought at fairs, and then been unable to dispose of, now suddenly become tradeable, and go off with a rush. For instance, on one occasion a lady appeared at Mass in a bustle which filled the church to an extent which led the verger on duty to bid the commoner folk withdraw to the porch, lest the lady's toilet should be soiled in the crush. Even Chichikov could not help privately remarking the attention which he aroused. On one occasion, when he returned to the inn, he found on his table a note addressed to himself. Whence it had come, and who had delivered it, he failed to discover, for the waiter declared that the person who had brought it had omitted to leave the name of the writer. Beginning abruptly with the words “I MUST write to you,” the letter went on to say that between a certain pair of souls there existed a bond of sympathy; and this verity the epistle further confirmed with rows of full stops to the extent of nearly half a page. Next there followed a few reflections of a correctitude so remarkable that I have no choice but to quote them. “What, I would ask, is this life of ours?” inquired the writer. “'Tis nought but a vale of woe. And what, I would ask, is the world? 'Tis nought but a mob of unthinking humanity.” Thereafter, incidentally remarking that she had just dropped a tear to the memory of her dear mother, who had departed this life twenty-five years ago, the (presumably) lady writer invited Chichikov to come forth into the wilds, and to leave for ever the city where, penned in noisome haunts, folk could not even draw their breath. In conclusion, the writer gave way to unconcealed despair, and wound up with the following verses:

“Two turtle doves to thee, one day,

My dust will show, congealed in death;

And, cooing wearily, they'll say:

‘In grief and loneliness she drew her closing breath.’”

True, the last line did not scan, but that was a trifle, since the quatrain at least conformed to the mode then prevalent. Neither signature nor date were appended to the document, but only a postscript expressing a conjecture that Chichikov's own heart would tell him who the writer was, and stating, in addition, that the said writer would be present at the Governor's ball on the following night.

This greatly interested Chichikov. Indeed, there was so much that was alluring and provocative of curiosity in the anonymous missive that he read it through a second time, and then a third, and finally said to himself: “I SHOULD like to know who sent it!” In short, he took the thing seriously, and spent over an hour in considering the same. At length, muttering a comment upon the epistle's efflorescent style, he refolded the document, and committed it to his dispatch-box in company with a play-bill and an invitation to a wedding—the latter of which had for the last seven years reposed in the self-same receptacle and in the self-same position. Shortly afterwards there arrived a card of invitation to the Governor's ball already referred to. In passing, it may be said that such festivities are not infrequent phenomena in county towns, for the reason that where Governors exist there must take place balls if from the local gentry there is to be evoked that respectful affection which is every Governor's due.

Thenceforth all extraneous thoughts and considerations were laid aside in favour of preparing for the coming function. Indeed, this conjunction of exciting and provocative motives led to Chichikov devoting to his toilet an amount of time never witnessed since the creation of the world. Merely in the contemplation of his features in the mirror, as he tried to communicate to them a succession of varying expressions, was an hour spent. First of all he strove to make his features assume an air of dignity and importance, and then an air of humble, but faintly satirical, respect, and then an air of respect guiltless of any alloy whatsoever. Next, he practised performing a series of bows to his reflection, accompanied with certain murmurs intended to bear a resemblance to a French phrase (though Chichikov knew not a single word of the Gallic tongue). Lastly came the performing of a series of what I might call “agreeable surprises,” in the shape of twitchings of the brow and lips and certain motions of the tongue. In short, he did all that a man is apt to do when he is not only alone, but also certain that he is handsome and that no one is regarding him through a chink. Finally he tapped himself lightly on the chin, and said, “Ah, good old face!” In the same way, when he started to dress himself for the ceremony, the level of his high spirits remained unimpaired throughout the process. That is to say, while adjusting his braces and tying his tie, he shuffled his feet in what was not exactly a dance, but might be called the entr'acte of a dance: which performance had the not very serious result of setting a wardrobe a-rattle, and causing a brush to slide from the table to the floor.

Later, his entry into the ballroom produced an extraordinary effect. Every one present came forward to meet him, some with cards in their hands, and one man even breaking off a conversation at the most interesting point—namely, the point that “the Inferior Land Court must be made responsible for everything.” Yes, in spite of the responsibility of the Inferior Land Court, the speaker cast all thoughts of it to the winds as he hurried to greet our hero. From every side resounded acclamations of welcome, and Chichikov felt himself engulfed in a sea of embraces. Thus, scarcely had he extricated himself from the arms of the President of the Local Council when he found himself just as firmly clasped in the arms of the Chief of Police, who, in turn, surrendered him to the Inspector of the Medical Department, who, in turn, handed him over to the Commissioner of Taxes, who, again, committed him to the charge of the Town Architect. Even the Governor, who hitherto had been standing among his womenfolk with a box of sweets in one hand and a lap-dog in the other, now threw down both sweets and lapdog (the lap-dog giving vent to a yelp as he did so) and added his greeting to those of the rest of the company. Indeed, not a face was there to be seen on which ecstatic delight—or, at all events, the reflection of other people's ecstatic delight—was not painted. The same expression may be discerned on the faces of subordinate officials when, the newly arrived Director having made his inspection, the said officials are beginning to get over their first sense of awe on perceiving that he has found much to commend, and that he can even go so far as to jest and utter a few words of smiling approval. Thereupon every tchinovnik responds with a smile of double strength, and those who (it may be) have not heard a single word of the Director's speech smile out of sympathy with the rest, and even the gendarme who is posted at the distant door—a man, perhaps, who has never before compassed a smile, but is more accustomed to dealing out blows to the populace—summons up a kind of grin, even though the grin resembles the grimace of a man who is about to sneeze after inadvertently taking an over-large pinch of snuff. To all and sundry Chichikov responded with a bow, and felt extraordinarily at his ease as he did so. To right and left did he incline his head in the sidelong, yet unconstrained, manner that was his wont and never failed to charm the beholder. As for the ladies, they clustered around him in a shining bevy that was redolent of every species of perfume—of roses, of spring violets, and of mignonette; so much so that instinctively Chichikov raised his nose to snuff the air. Likewise the ladies' dresses displayed an endless profusion of taste and variety; and though the majority of their wearers evinced a tendency to embonpoint, those wearers knew how to call upon art for the concealment of the fact. Confronting them, Chichikov thought to himself: “Which of these beauties is the writer of the letter?” Then again he snuffed the air. When the ladies had, to a certain extent, returned to their seats, he resumed his attempts to discern (from glances and expressions) which of them could possibly be the unknown authoress. Yet, though those glances and expressions were too subtle, too insufficiently open, the difficulty in no way diminished his high spirits. Easily and gracefully did he exchange agreeable bandinage with one lady, and then approach another one with the short, mincing steps usually affected by young-old dandies who are fluttering around the fair. As he turned, not without dexterity, to right and left, he kept one leg slightly dragging behind the other, like a short tail or comma. This trick the ladies particularly admired. In short, they not only discovered in him a host of recommendations and attractions, but also began to see in his face a sort of grand, Mars-like, military expression—a thing which, as we know, never fails to please the feminine eye. Certain of the ladies even took to bickering over him, and, on perceiving that he spent most of his time standing near the door, some of their number hastened to occupy chairs nearer to his post of vantage. In fact, when a certain dame chanced to have the good fortune to anticipate a hated rival in the race there very nearly ensued a most lamentable scene—which, to many of those who had been desirous of doing exactly the same thing, seemed a peculiarly horrible instance of brazen-faced audacity.

So deeply did Chichikov become plunged in conversation with his fair pursuers—or rather, so deeply did those fair pursuers enmesh him in the toils of small talk (which they accomplished through the expedient of asking him endless subtle riddles which brought the sweat to his brow in his attempts to guess them)—that he forgot the claims of courtesy which required him first of all to greet his hostess. In fact, he remembered those claims only on hearing the Governor's wife herself addressing him. She had been standing before him for several minutes, and now greeted him with suave expressement and the words, “So HERE you are, Paul Ivanovitch!” But what she said next I am not in a position to report, for she spoke in the ultra-refined tone and vein wherein ladies and gentlemen customarily express themselves in high-class novels which have been written by experts more qualified than I am to describe salons, and able to boast of some acquaintance with good society. In effect, what the Governor's wife said was that she hoped—she greatly hoped—that Monsieur Chichikov's heart still contained a corner—even the smallest possible corner—for those whom he had so cruelly forgotten. Upon that Chichikov turned to her, and was on the point of returning a reply at least no worse than that which would have been returned, under similar circumstances, by the hero of a fashionable novelette, when he stopped short, as though thunderstruck.

Before him there was standing not only Madame, but also a young girl whom she was holding by the hand. The golden hair, the fine-drawn, delicate contours, the face with its bewitching oval—a face which might have served as a model for the countenance of the Madonna, since it was of a type rarely to be met with in Russia, where nearly everything, from plains to human feet, is, rather, on the gigantic scale; these features, I say, were those of the identical maiden whom Chichikov had encountered on the road when he had been fleeing from Nozdrev's. His emotion was such that he could not formulate a single intelligible syllable; he could merely murmur the devil only knows what, though certainly nothing of the kind which would have risen to the lips of the hero of a fashionable novel.

“I think that you have not met my daughter before?” said Madame. “She is just fresh from school.”

He replied that he HAD had the happiness of meeting Mademoiselle before, and under rather unexpected circumstances; but on his trying to say something further his tongue completely failed him. The Governor's wife added a word or two, and then carried off her daughter to speak to some of the other guests.

Chichikov stood rooted to the spot, like a man who, after issuing into the street for a pleasant walk, has suddenly come to a halt on remembering that something has been left behind him. In a moment, as he struggles to recall what that something is, the mien of careless expectancy disappears from his face, and he no longer sees a single person or a single object in his vicinity. In the same way did Chichikov suddenly become oblivious to the scene around him. Yet all the while the melodious tongues of ladies were plying him with multitudinous hints and questions—hints and questions inspired with a desire to captivate. “Might we poor cumberers of the ground make so bold as to ask you what you are thinking of?” “Pray tell us where lie the happy regions in which your thoughts are wandering?” “Might we be informed of the name of her who has plunged you into this sweet abandonment of meditation?”—such were the phrases thrown at him. But to everything he turned a dead ear, and the phrases in question might as well have been stones dropped into a pool. Indeed, his rudeness soon reached the pitch of his walking away altogether, in order that he might go and reconnoitre wither the Governor's wife and daughter had retreated. But the ladies were not going to let him off so easily. Every one of them had made up her mind to use upon him her every weapon, and to exhibit whatsoever might chance to constitute her best point. Yet the ladies' wiles proved useless, for Chichikov paid not the smallest attention to them, even when the dancing had begun, but kept raising himself on tiptoe to peer over people's heads and ascertain in which direction the bewitching maiden with the golden hair had gone. Also, when seated, he continued to peep between his neighbours' backs and shoulders, until at last he discovered her sitting beside her mother, who was wearing a sort of Oriental turban and feather. Upon that one would have thought that his purpose was to carry the position by storm; for, whether moved by the influence of spring, or whether moved by a push from behind, he pressed forward with such desperate resolution that his elbow caused the Commissioner of Taxes to stagger on his feet, and would have caused him to lose his balance altogether but for the supporting row of guests in the rear. Likewise the Postmaster was made to give ground; whereupon he turned and eyed Chichikov with mingled astonishment and subtle irony. But Chichikov never even noticed him; he saw in the distance only the golden-haired beauty. At that moment she was drawing on a long glove and, doubtless, pining to be flying over the dancing-floor, where, with clicking heels, four couples had now begun to thread the mazes of the mazurka. In particular was a military staff-captain working body and soul and arms and legs to compass such a series of steps as were never before performed, even in a dream. However, Chichikov slipped past the mazurka dancers, and, almost treading on their heels, made his way towards the spot where Madame and her daughter were seated. Yet he approached them with great diffidence and none of his late mincing and prancing. Nay, he even faltered as he walked; his every movement had about it an air of awkwardness.

It is difficult to say whether or not the feeling which had awakened in our hero's breast was the feeling of love; for it is problematical whether or not men who are neither stout nor thin are capable of any such sentiment. Nevertheless, something strange, something which he could not altogether explain, had come upon him. It seemed as though the ball, with its talk and its clatter, had suddenly become a thing remote—that the orchestra had withdrawn behind a hill, and the scene grown misty, like the carelessly painted-in background of a picture. And from that misty void there could be seen glimmering only the delicate outlines of the bewitching maiden. Somehow her exquisite shape reminded him of an ivory toy, in such fair, white, transparent relief did it stand out against the dull blur of the surrounding throng.

Herein we see a phenomenon not infrequently observed—the phenomenon of the Chichikovs of this world becoming temporarily poets. At all events, for a moment or two our Chichikov felt that he was a young man again, if not exactly a military officer. On perceiving an empty chair beside the mother and daughter, he hastened to occupy it, and though conversation at first hung fire, things gradually improved, and he acquired more confidence.

At this point I must reluctantly deviate to say that men of weight and high office are always a trifle ponderous when conversing with ladies. Young lieutenants—or, at all events, officers not above the rank of captain—are far more successful at the game. How they contrive to be so God only knows. Let them but make the most inane of remarks, and at once the maiden by their side will be rocking with laughter; whereas, should a State Councillor enter into conversation with a damsel, and remark that the Russian Empire is one of vast extent, or utter a compliment which he has elaborated not without a certain measure of intelligence (however strongly the said compliment may smack of a book), of a surety the thing will fall flat. Even a witticism from him will be laughed at far more by him himself than it will by the lady who may happen to be listening to his remarks.

These comments I have interposed for the purpose of explaining to the reader why, as our hero conversed, the maiden began to yawn. Blind to this, however, he continued to relate to her sundry adventures which had befallen him in different parts of the world. Meanwhile (as need hardly be said) the rest of the ladies had taken umbrage at his behaviour. One of them purposely stalked past him to intimate to him the fact, as well as to jostle the Governor's daughter, and let the flying end of a scarf flick her face; while from a lady seated behind the pair came both a whiff of violets and a very venomous and sarcastic remark. Nevertheless, either he did not hear the remark or he PRETENDED not to hear it. This was unwise of him, since it never does to disregard ladies' opinions. Later-but too late—he was destined to learn this to his cost.

In short, dissatisfaction began to display itself on every feminine face. No matter how high Chichikov might stand in society, and no matter how much he might be a millionaire and include in his expression of countenance an indefinable element of grandness and martial ardour, there are certain things which no lady will pardon, whosoever be the person concerned. We know that at Governor's balls it is customary for the onlookers to compose verses at the expense of the dancers; and in this case the verses were directed to Chichikov's address. Briefly, the prevailing dissatisfaction grew until a tacit edict of proscription had been issued against both him and the poor young maiden.

But an even more unpleasant surprise was in store for our hero; for whilst the young lady was still yawning as Chichikov recounted to her certain of his past adventures and also touched lightly upon the subject of Greek philosophy, there appeared from an adjoining room the figure of Nozdrev. Whether he had come from the buffet, or whether he had issued from a little green retreat where a game more strenuous than whist had been in progress, or whether he had left the latter resort unaided, or whether he had been expelled therefrom, is unknown; but at all events when he entered the ballroom, he was in an elevated condition, and leading by the arm the Public Prosecutor, whom he seemed to have been dragging about for a long while past, seeing that the poor man was glancing from side to side as though seeking a means of putting an end to this personally conducted tour. Certainly he must have found the situation almost unbearable, in view of the fact that, after deriving inspiration from two glasses of tea not wholly undiluted with rum, Nozdrev was engaged in lying unmercifully. On sighting him in the distance, Chichikov at once decided to sacrifice himself. That is to say, he decided to vacate his present enviable position and make off with all possible speed, since he could see that an encounter with the newcomer would do him no good. Unfortunately at that moment the Governor buttonholed him with a request that he would come and act as arbiter between him (the Governor) and two ladies—the subject of dispute being the question as to whether or not woman's love is lasting. Simultaneously Nozdrev descried our hero and bore down upon him.

“Ah, my fine landowner of Kherson!” he cried with a smile which set his fresh, spring-rose-pink cheeks a-quiver. “Have you been doing much trade in departed souls lately?” With that he turned to the Governor. “I suppose your Excellency knows that this man traffics in dead peasants?” he bawled. “Look here, Chichikov. I tell you in the most friendly way possible that every one here likes you—yes, including even the Governor. Nevertheless, had I my way, I would hang you! Yes, by God I would!”

Chichikov's discomfiture was complete.

“And, would you believe it, your Excellency,” went on Nozdrev, “but this fellow actually said to me, ‘Sell me your dead souls!’ Why, I laughed till I nearly became as dead as the souls. And, behold, no sooner do I arrive here than I am told that he has bought three million roubles' worth of peasants for transferment! For transferment, indeed! And he wanted to bargain with me for my DEAD ones! Look here, Chichikov. You are a swine! Yes, by God, you are an utter swine! Is not that so, your Excellency? Is not that so, friend Prokurator ?”

But both his Excellency, the Public Prosecutor, and Chichikov were too taken aback to reply. The half-tipsy Nozdrev, without noticing them, continued his harangue as before.

“Ah, my fine sir!” he cried. “THIS time I don't mean to let you go. No, not until I have learnt what all this purchasing of dead peasants means. Look here. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Yes, I say that—I who am one of your best friends.” Here he turned to the Governor again. “Your Excellency,” he continued, “you would never believe what inseperables this man and I have been. Indeed, if you had stood there and said to me, ‘Nozdrev, tell me on your honour which of the two you love best—your father or Chichikov?’ I should have replied, ‘Chichikov, by God!’” With that he tackled our hero again, “Come, come, my friend!” he urged. “Let me imprint upon your cheeks a baiser or two. You will excuse me if I kiss him, will you not, your Excellency? No, do not resist me, Chichikov, but allow me to imprint at least one baiser upon your lily-white cheek.” And in his efforts to force upon Chichikov what he termed his “baisers” he came near to measuring his length upon the floor.

Every one now edged away, and turned a deaf ear to his further babblings; but his words on the subject of the purchase of dead souls had none the less been uttered at the top of his voice, and been accompanied with such uproarious laughter that the curiosity even of those who had happened to be sitting or standing in the remoter corners of the room had been aroused. So strange and novel seemed the idea that the company stood with faces expressive of nothing but a dumb, dull wonder. Only some of the ladies (as Chichikov did not fail to remark) exchanged meaning, ill-natured winks and a series of sarcastic smiles: which circumstance still further increased his confusion. That Nozdrev was a notorious liar every one, of course, knew, and that he should have given vent to an idiotic outburst of this sort had surprised no one; but a dead soul—well, what was one to make of Nozdrev's reference to such a commodity?

Naturally this unseemly contretemps had greatly upset our hero; for, however foolish be a madman's words, they may yet prove sufficient to sow doubt in the minds of saner individuals. He felt much as does a man who, shod with well-polished boots, has just stepped into a dirty, stinking puddle. He tried to put away from him the occurrence, and to expand, and to enjoy himself once more. Nay, he even took a hand at whist. But all was of no avail—matters kept going as awry as a badly-bent hoop. Twice he blundered in his play, and the President of the Council was at a loss to understand how his friend, Paul Ivanovitch, lately so good and so circumspect a player, could perpetrate such a mauvais pas as to throw away a particular king of spades which the President has been “trusting” as (to quote his own expression) “he would have trusted God.” At supper, too, matters felt uncomfortable, even though the society at Chichikov's table was exceedingly agreeable and Nozdrev had been removed, owing to the fact that the ladies had found his conduct too scandalous to be borne, now that the delinquent had taken to seating himself on the floor and plucking at the skirts of passing lady dancers. As I say, therefore, Chichikov found the situation not a little awkward, and eventually put an end to it by leaving the supper room before the meal was over, and long before the hour when usually he returned to the inn.

In his little room, with its door of communication blocked with a wardrobe, his frame of mind remained as uncomfortable as the chair in which he was seated. His heart ached with a dull, unpleasant sensation, with a sort of oppressive emptiness.

“The devil take those who first invented balls!” was his reflection. “Who derives any real pleasure from them? In this province there exist want and scarcity everywhere: yet folk go in for balls! How absurd, too, were those overdressed women! One of them must have had a thousand roubles on her back, and all acquired at the expense of the overtaxed peasant, or, worse still, at that of the conscience of her neighbour. Yes, we all know why bribes are accepted, and why men become crooked in soul. It is all done to provide wives—yes, may the pit swallow them up!—with fal-lals. And for what purpose? That some woman may not have to reproach her husband with the fact that, say, the Postmaster's wife is wearing a better dress than she is—a dress which has cost a thousand roubles! ‘Balls and gaiety, balls and gaiety’ is the constant cry. Yet what folly balls are! They do not consort with the Russian spirit and genius, and the devil only knows why we have them. A grown, middle-aged man—a man dressed in black, and looking as stiff as a poker—suddenly takes the floor and begins shuffling his feet about, while another man, even though conversing with a companion on important business, will, the while, keep capering to right and left like a billy-goat! Mimicry, sheer mimicry! The fact that the Frenchman is at forty precisely what he was at fifteen leads us to imagine that we too, forsooth, ought to be the same. No; a ball leaves one feeling that one has done a wrong thing—so much so that one does not care even to think of it. It also leaves one's head perfectly empty, even as does the exertion of talking to a man of the world. A man of that kind chatters away, and touches lightly upon every conceivable subject, and talks in smooth, fluent phrases which he has culled from books without grazing their substance; whereas go and have a chat with a tradesman who knows at least ONE thing thoroughly, and through the medium of experience, and see whether his conversation will not be worth more than the prattle of a thousand chatterboxes. For what good does one get out of balls? Suppose that a competent writer were to describe such a scene exactly as it stands? Why, even in a book it would seem senseless, even as it certainly is in life. Are, therefore, such functions right or wrong? One would answer that the devil alone knows, and then spit and close the book.”

Such were the unfavourable comments which Chichikov passed upon balls in general. With it all, however, there went a second source of dissatisfaction. That is to say, his principal grudge was not so much against balls as against the fact that at this particular one he had been exposed, he had been made to disclose the circumstance that he had been playing a strange, an ambiguous part. Of course, when he reviewed the contretemps in the light of pure reason, he could not but see that it mattered nothing, and that a few rude words were of no account now that the chief point had been attained; yet man is an odd creature, and Chichikov actually felt pained by the could-shouldering administered to him by persons for whom he had not an atom of respect, and whose vanity and love of display he had only that moment been censuring. Still more, on viewing the matter clearly, he felt vexed to think that he himself had been so largely the cause of the catastrophe.

Yet he was not angry with HIMSELF—of that you may be sure, seeing that all of us have a slight weakness for sparing our own faults, and always do our best to find some fellow-creature upon whom to vent our displeasure— whether that fellow-creature be a servant, a subordinate official, or a wife. In the same way Chichikov sought a scapegoat upon whose shoulders he could lay the blame for all that had annoyed him. He found one in Nozdrev, and you may be sure that the scapegoat in question received a good drubbing from every side, even as an experienced captain or chief of police will give a knavish starosta or postboy a rating not only in the terms become classical, but also in such terms as the said captain or chief of police may invent for himself. In short, Nozdrev's whole lineage was passed in review; and many of its members in the ascending line fared badly in the process.

Meanwhile, at the other end of the town there was in progress an event which was destined to augment still further the unpleasantness of our hero's position. That is to say, through the outlying streets and alleys of the town there was clattering a vehicle to which it would be difficult precisely to assign a name, seeing that, though it was of a species peculiar to itself, it most nearly resembled a large, rickety water melon on wheels. Eventually this monstrosity drew up at the gates of a house where the archpriest of one of the churches resided, and from its doors there leapt a damsel clad in a jerkin and wearing a scarf over her head. For a while she thumped the gates so vigorously as to set all the dogs barking; then the gates stiffly opened, and admitted this unwieldy phenomenon of the road. Lastly, the barinia herself alighted, and stood revealed as Madame Korobotchka, widow of a Collegiate Secretary! The reason of her sudden arrival was that she had felt so uneasy about the possible outcome of Chichikov's whim, that during the three nights following his departure she had been unable to sleep a wink; whereafter, in spite of the fact that her horses were not shod, she had set off for the town, in order to learn at first hand how the dead souls were faring, and whether (which might God forfend!) she had not sold them at something like a third of their true value. The consequences of her venture the reader will learn from a conversation between two ladies. We will reserve it for the ensuing chapter.





CHAPTER IX


Next morning, before the usual hour for paying calls, there tripped from the portals of an orange-coloured wooden house with an attic storey and a row of blue pillars a lady in an elegant plaid cloak. With her came a footman in a many-caped greatcoat and a polished top hat with a gold band. Hastily, but gracefully, the lady ascended the steps let down from a koliaska which was standing before the entrance, and as soon as she had done so the footman shut her in, put up the steps again, and, catching hold of the strap behind the vehicle, shouted to the coachman, “Right away!” The reason of all this was that the lady was the possessor of a piece of intelligence that she was burning to communicate to a fellow-creature. Every moment she kept looking out of the carriage window, and perceiving, with almost speechless vexation, that, as yet, she was but half-way on her journey. The fronts of the houses appeared to her longer than usual, and in particular did the front of the white stone hospital, with its rows of narrow windows, seem interminable to a degree which at length forced her to ejaculate: “Oh, the cursed building! Positively there is no end to it!” Also, she twice adjured the coachman with the words, “Go quicker, Andrusha! You are a horribly long time over the journey this morning.” But at length the goal was reached, and the koliaska stopped before a one-storied wooden mansion, dark grey in colour, and having white carvings over the windows, a tall wooden fence and narrow garden in front of the latter, and a few meagre trees looming white with an incongruous coating of road dust. In the windows of the building were also a few flower pots and a parrot that kept alternately dancing on the floor of its cage and hanging on to the ring of the same with its beak. Also, in the sunshine before the door two pet dogs were sleeping. Here there lived the lady's bosom friend. As soon as the bosom friend in question learnt of the newcomer's arrival, she ran down into the hall, and the two ladies kissed and embraced one another. Then they adjourned to the drawing-room.

“How glad I am to see you!” said the bosom friend. “When I heard some one arriving I wondered who could possibly be calling so early. Parasha declared that it must be the Vice-Governor's wife, so, as I did not want to be bored with her, I gave orders that I was to be reported ‘not at home.’”

For her part, the guest would have liked to have proceeded to business by communicating her tidings, but a sudden exclamation from the hostess imparted (temporarily) a new direction to the conversation.

“What a pretty chintz!” she cried, gazing at the other's gown.

“Yes, it IS pretty,” agreed the visitor. “On the other hand, Praskovia Thedorovna thinks that—”

In other words, the ladies proceeded to indulge in a conversation on the subject of dress; and only after this had lasted for a considerable while did the visitor let fall a remark which led her entertainer to inquire:

“And how is the universal charmer?”

“My God!” replied the other. “There has been SUCH a business! In fact, do you know why I am here at all?” And the visitor's breathing became more hurried, and further words seemed to be hovering between her lips like hawks preparing to stoop upon their prey. Only a person of the unhumanity of a “true friend” would have had the heart to interrupt her; but the hostess was just such a friend, and at once interposed with:

“I wonder how any one can see anything in the man to praise or to admire. For my own part, I think—and I would say the same thing straight to his face—that he is a perfect rascal.”

“Yes, but do listen to what I have got to tell you.”

“Oh, I know that some people think him handsome,” continued the hostess, unmoved; “but I say that he is nothing of the kind—that, in particular, his nose is perfectly odious.”

“Yes, but let me finish what I was saying.” The guest's tone was almost piteous in its appeal.

“What is it, then?”

“You cannot imagine my state of mind! You see, this morning I received a visit from Father Cyril's wife—the Archpriest's wife—you know her, don't you? Well, whom do you suppose that fine gentleman visitor of ours has turned out to be?”

“The man who has built the Archpriest a poultry-run?”

“Oh dear no! Had that been all, it would have been nothing. No. Listen to what Father Cyril's wife had to tell me. She said that, last night, a lady landowner named Madame Korobotchka arrived at the Archpriest's house— arrived all pale and trembling—and told her, oh, such things! They sound like a piece out of a book. That is to say, at dead of night, just when every one had retired to rest, there came the most dreadful knocking imaginable, and some one screamed out, ‘Open the gates, or we will break them down!’ Just think! After this, how any one can say that the man is charming I cannot imagine.”

“Well, what of Madame Korobotchka? Is she a young woman or good looking?”

“Oh dear no! Quite an old woman.”

“Splendid indeed! So he is actually engaged to a person like that? One may heartily commend the taste of our ladies for having fallen in love with him!”

“Nevertheless, it is not as you suppose. Think, now! Armed with weapons from head to foot, he called upon this old woman, and said: ‘Sell me any souls of yours which have lately died.’ Of course, Madame Korobotchka answered, reasonably enough: ‘I cannot sell you those souls, seeing that they have departed this world;’ but he replied: ‘No, no! They are NOT dead. 'Tis I who tell you that—I who ought to know the truth of the matter. I swear that they are still alive.’ In short, he made such a scene that the whole village came running to the house, and children screamed, and men shouted, and no one could tell what it was all about. The affair seemed to me so horrible, so utterly horrible, that I trembled beyond belief as I listened to the story. ‘My dearest madam,’ said my maid, Mashka, ‘pray look at yourself in the mirror, and see how white you are.’ ‘But I have no time for that,’ I replied, ‘as I must be off to tell my friend, Anna Grigorievna, the news.’ Nor did I lose a moment in ordering the koliaska. Yet when my coachman, Andrusha, asked me for directions I could not get a word out—I just stood staring at him like a fool, until I thought he must think me mad. Oh, Anna Grigorievna, if you but knew how upset I am!”

“What a strange affair!” commented the hostess. “What on earth can the man have meant by ‘dead souls’? I confess that the words pass my understanding. Curiously enough, this is the second time I have heard speak of those souls. True, my husband avers that Nozdrev was lying; yet in his lies there seems to have been a grain of truth.”

“Well, just think of my state when I heard all this! ‘And now,’ apparently said Korobotchka to the Archpriest's wife, ‘I am altogether at a loss what to do, for, throwing me fifteen roubles, the man forced me to sign a worthless paper—yes, me, an inexperienced, defenceless widow who knows nothing of business.’ That such things should happen! TRY and imagine my feelings!”

“In my opinion, there is in this more than the dead souls which meet the eye.”

“I think so too,” agreed the other. As a matter of fact, her friend's remark had struck her with complete surprise, as well as filled her with curiosity to know what the word “more” might possibly signify. In fact, she felt driven to inquire: “What do YOU suppose to be hidden beneath it all?”

“No; tell me what YOU suppose?”

“What I suppose? I am at a loss to conjecture.”

“Yes, but tell me what is in your mind?”

Upon this the visitor had to confess herself nonplussed; for, though capable of growing hysterical, she was incapable of propounding any rational theory. Consequently she felt the more that she needed tender comfort and advice.

“Then THIS is what I think about the dead souls,” said the hostess. Instantly the guest pricked up her ears (or, rather, they pricked themselves up) and straightened herself and became, somehow, more modish, and, despite her not inconsiderable weight, posed herself to look like a piece of thistledown floating on the breeze.

“The dead souls,” began the hostess.

“Are what, are what?” inquired the guest in great excitement.

“Are, are—”

“Tell me, tell me, for heaven's sake!”

“They are an invention to conceal something else. The man's real object is, is—TO ABDUCT THE GOVERNOR'S DAUGHTER.”

So startling and unexpected was this conclusion that the guest sat reduced to a state of pale, petrified, genuine amazement.

“My God!” she cried, clapping her hands, “I should NEVER have guessed it!”

“Well, to tell you the truth, I guessed it as soon as ever you opened your mouth.”

“So much, then, for educating girls like the Governor's daughter at school! Just see what comes of it!”

“Yes, indeed! And they tell me that she says things which I hesitate even to repeat.”

“Truly it wrings one's heart to see to what lengths immorality has come.”

“Some of the men have quite lost their heads about her, but for my part I think her not worth noticing.”

“Of course. And her manners are unbearable. But what puzzles me most is how a travelled man like Chichikov could come to let himself in for such an affair. Surely he must have accomplices?”

“Yes; and I should say that one of those accomplices is Nozdrev.”

“Surely not?”

“CERTAINLY I should say so. Why, I have known him even try to sell his own father! At all events he staked him at cards.”

“Indeed? You interest me. I should never had thought him capable of such things.”

“I always guessed him to be so.”

The two ladies were still discussing the matter with acumen and success when there walked into the room the Public Prosecutor—bushy eyebrows, motionless features, blinking eyes, and all. At once the ladies hastened to inform him of the events related, adducing therewith full details both as to the purchase of dead souls and as to the scheme to abduct the Governor's daughter; after which they departed in different directions, for the purpose of raising the rest of the town. For the execution of this undertaking not more than half an hour was required. So thoroughly did they succeed in throwing dust in the public's eyes that for a while every one—more especially the army of public officials—was placed in the position of a schoolboy who, while still asleep, has had a bag of pepper thrown in his face by a party of more early-rising comrades. The questions now to be debated resolved themselves into two—namely, the question of the dead souls and the question of the Governor's daughter. To this end two parties were formed—the men's party and the feminine section. The men's party—the more absolutely senseless of the two—devoted its attention to the dead souls: the women's party occupied itself exclusively with the alleged abduction of the Governor's daughter. And here it may be said (to the ladies' credit) that the women's party displayed far more method and caution than did its rival faction, probably because the function in life of its members had always been that of managing and administering a household. With the ladies, therefore, matters soon assumed vivid and definite shape; they became clearly and irrefutably materialised; they stood stripped of all doubt and other impedimenta. Said some of the ladies in question, Chichikov had long been in love with the maiden, and the pair had kept tryst by the light of the moon, while the Governor would have given his consent (seeing that Chichikov was as rich as a Jew) but for the obstacle that Chichikov had deserted a wife already (how the worthy dames came to know that he was married remains a mystery), and the said deserted wife, pining with love for her faithless husband, had sent the Governor a letter of the most touching kind, so that Chichikov, on perceiving that the father and mother would never give their consent, had decided to abduct the girl. In other circles the matter was stated in a different way. That is to say, this section averred that Chichikov did NOT possess a wife, but that, as a man of subtlety and experience, he had bethought him of obtaining the daughter's hand through the expedient of first tackling the mother and carrying on with her an ardent liaison, and that, thereafter, he had made an application for the desired hand, but that the mother, fearing to commit a sin against religion, and feeling in her heart certain gnawings of conscience, had returned a blank refusal to Chichikov's request; whereupon Chichikov had decided to carry out the abduction alleged. To the foregoing, of course, there became appended various additional proofs and items of evidence, in proportion as the sensation spread to more remote corners of the town. At length, with these perfectings, the affair reached the ears of the Governor's wife herself. Naturally, as the mother of a family, and as the first lady in the town, and as a matron who had never before been suspected of things of the kind, she was highly offended when she heard the stories, and very justly so: with the result that her poor young daughter, though innocent, had to endure about as unpleasant a tête-àtêteas ever befell a maiden of sixteen, while, for his part, the Swiss footman received orders never at any time to admit Chichikov to the house.

Having done their business with the Governor's wife, the ladies' party descended upon the male section, with a view to influencing it to their own side by asserting that the dead souls were an invention used solely for the purpose of diverting suspicion and successfully affecting the abduction. And, indeed, more than one man was converted, and joined the feminine camp, in spite of the fact that thereby such seceders incurred strong names from their late comrades—names such as “old women,” “petticoats,” and others of a nature peculiarly offensive to the male sex.

Also, however much they might arm themselves and take the field, the men could not compass such orderliness within their ranks as could the women. With the former everything was of the antiquated and rough-hewn and ill-fitting and unsuitable and badly-adapted and inferior kind; their heads were full of nothing but discord and triviality and confusion and slovenliness of thought. In brief, they displayed everywhere the male bent, the rude, ponderous nature which is incapable either of managing a household or of jumping to a conclusion, as well as remains always distrustful and lazy and full of constant doubt and everlasting timidity. For instance, the men's party declared that the whole story was rubbish—that the alleged abduction of the Governor's daughter was the work rather of a military than of a civilian culprit; that the ladies were lying when they accused Chichikov of the deed; that a woman was like a money-bag—whatsoever you put into her she thenceforth retained; that the subject which really demanded attention was the dead souls, of which the devil only knew the meaning, but in which there certainly lurked something that was contrary to good order and discipline. One reason why the men's party was so certain that the dead souls connoted something contrary to good order and discipline, was that there had just been appointed to the province a new Governor-General—an event which, of course, had thrown the whole army of provincial tchinovniks into a state of great excitement, seeing that they knew that before long there would ensue transferments and sentences of censure, as well as the series of official dinners with which a Governor-General is accustomed to entertain his subordinates. “Alas,” thought the army of tchinovniks, “it is probable that, should he learn of the gross reports at present afloat in our town, he will make such a fuss that we shall never hear the last of them.” In particular did the Director of the Medical Department turn pale at the thought that possibly the new Governor-General would surmise the term “dead folk” to connote patients in the local hospitals who, for want of proper preventative measures, had died of sporadic fever. Indeed, might it not be that Chichikov was neither more nor less than an emissary of the said Governor-General, sent to conduct a secret inquiry? Accordingly he (the Director of the Medical Department) communicated this last supposition to the President of the Council, who, though at first inclined to ejaculate “Rubbish!” suddenly turned pale on propounding to himself the theory. “What if the souls purchased by Chichikov should REALLY be dead ones?”—a terrible thought considering that he, the President, had permitted their transferment to be registered, and had himself acted as Plushkin's representative! What if these things should reach the Governor-General's ears? He mentioned the matter to one friend and another, and they, in their turn, went white to the lips, for panic spreads faster and is even more destructive, than the dreaded black death. Also, to add to the tchinovniks' troubles, it so befell that just at this juncture there came into the local Governor's hands two documents of great importance. The first of them contained advices that, according to received evidence and reports, there was operating in the province a forger of rouble-notes who had been passing under various aliases and must therefore be sought for with the utmost diligence; while the second document was a letter from the Governor of a neighbouring province with regard to a malefactor who had there evaded apprehension—a letter conveying also a warning that, if in the province of the town of N. there should appear any suspicious individual who could produce neither references nor passports, he was to be arrested forthwith. These two documents left every one thunderstruck, for they knocked on the head all previous conceptions and theories. Not for a moment could it be supposed that the former document referred to Chichikov; yet, as each man pondered the position from his own point of view, he remembered that no one REALLY knew who Chichikov was; as also that his vague references to himself had— yes!—included statements that his career in the service had suffered much to the cause of Truth, and that he possessed a number of enemies who were seeking his life. This gave the tchinovniks further food for thought. Perhaps his life really DID stand in danger? Perhaps he really WAS being sought for by some one? Perhaps he really HAD done something of the kind above referred to? As a matter of fact, who was he?—not that it could actually be supposed that he was a forger of notes, still less a brigand, seeing that his exterior was respectable in the highest degree. Yet who was he? At length the tchinovniks decided to make enquiries among those of whom he had purchased souls, in order that at least it might be learnt what the purchases had consisted of, and what exactly underlay them, and whether, in passing, he had explained to any one his real intentions, or revealed to any one his identity. In the first instance, therefore, resort was had to Korobotchka. Yet little was gleaned from that source—merely a statement that he had bought of her some souls for fifteen roubles apiece, and also a quantity of feathers, while promising also to buy some other commodities in the future, seeing that, in particular, he had entered into a contract with the Treasury for lard, a fact constituting fairly presumptive proof that the man was a rogue, seeing that just such another fellow had bought a quantity of feathers, yet had cheated folk all round, and, in particular, had done the Archpriest out of over a hundred roubles. Thus the net result of Madame's cross-examination was to convince the tchinovniks that she was a garrulous, silly old woman. With regard to Manilov, he replied that he would answer for Chichikov as he would for himself, and that he would gladly sacrifice his property in toto if thereby he could attain even a tithe of the qualities which Paul Ivanovitch possessed. Finally, he delivered on Chichikov, with acutely-knitted brows, a eulogy couched in the most charming of terms, and coupled with sundry sentiments on the subject of friendship and affection in general. True, these remarks sufficed to indicate the tender impulses of the speaker's heart, but also they did nothing to enlighten his examiners concerning the business that was actually at hand. As for Sobakevitch, that landowner replied that he considered Chichikov an excellent fellow, as well as that the souls whom he had sold to his visitor had been in the truest sense of the word alive, but that he could not answer for anything which might occur in the future, seeing that any difficulties which might arise in the course of the actual transferment of souls would not be HIS fault, in view of the fact that God was lord of all, and that fevers and other mortal complaints were so numerous in the world, and that instances of whole villages perishing through the same could be found on record.

Finally, our friends the tchinovniks found themselves compelled to resort to an expedient which, though not particularly savoury, is not infrequently employed—namely, the expedient of getting lacqueys quietly to approach the servants of the person concerning whom information is desired, and to ascertain from them (the servants) certain details with regard to their master's life and antecedents. Yet even from this source very little was obtained, since Petrushka provided his interrogators merely with a taste of the smell of his living-room, and Selifan confined his replies to a statement that the barin had “been in the employment of the State, and also had served in the Customs.”

In short, the sum total of the results gathered by the tchinovniks was that they still stood in ignorance of Chichikov's identity, but that he MUST be some one; wherefore it was decided to hold a final debate on the subject on what ought to be done, and who Chichikov could possibly be, and whether or not he was a man who ought to be apprehended and detained as not respectable, or whether he was a man who might himself be able to apprehend and detain THEM as persons lacking in respectability. The debate in question, it was proposed, should be held at the residence of the Chief of Police, who is known to our readers as the father and the general benefactor of the town.





CHAPTER X


On assembling at the residence indicated, the tchinovniks had occasion to remark that, owing to all these cares and excitements, every one of their number had grown thinner. Yes, the appointment of a new Governor-General, coupled with the rumours described and the reception of the two serious documents above-mentioned, had left manifest traces upon the features of every one present. More than one frockcoat had come to look too large for its wearer, and more than one frame had fallen away, including the frames of the President of the Council, the Director of the Medical Department, and the Public Prosecutor. Even a certain Semen Ivanovitch, who, for some reason or another, was never alluded to by his family name, but who wore on his index finger a ring with which he was accustomed to dazzle his lady friends, had diminished in bulk. Yet, as always happens at such junctures, there were also present a score of brazen individuals who had succeeded in NOT losing their presence of mind, even though they constituted a mere sprinkling. Of them the Postmaster formed one, since he was a man of equable temperament who could always say: “WE know you, Governor-Generals! We have seen three or four of you come and go, whereas WE have been sitting on the same stools these thirty years.” Nevertheless a prominent feature of the gathering was the total absence of what is vulgarly known as “common sense.” In general, we Russians do not make a good show at representative assemblies, for the reason that, unless there be in authority a leading spirit to control the rest, the affair always develops into confusion. Why this should be so one could hardly say, but at all events a success is scored only by such gatherings as have for their object dining and festivity—to wit, gatherings at clubs or in German-run restaurants. However, on the present occasion, the meeting was NOT one of this kind; it was a meeting convoked of necessity, and likely in view of the threatened calamity to affect every tchinovnik in the place. Also, in addition to the great divergency of views expressed thereat, there was visible in all the speakers an invincible tendency to indecision which led them at one moment to make assertions, and at the next to contradict the same. But on at least one point all seemed to agree—namely, that Chichikov's appearance and conversation were too respectable for him to be a forger or a disguised brigand. That is to say, all SEEMED to agree on the point; until a sudden shout arose from the direction of the Postmaster, who for some time past had been sitting plunged in thought.

“I can tell you,” he cried, “who Chichikov is!”

“Who, then?” replied the crowd in great excitement.

“He is none other than Captain Kopeikin.”

“And who may Captain Kopeikin be?”

Taking a pinch of snuff (which he did with the lid of his snuff-box half-open, lest some extraneous person should contrive to insert a not over-clean finger into the stuff), the Postmaster related the following story .

“After fighting in the campaign of 1812, there was sent home, wounded, a certain Captain Kopeikin—a headstrong, lively blade who, whether on duty or under arrest, made things lively for everybody. Now, since at Krasni or at Leipzig (it matters not which) he had lost an arm and a leg, and in those days no provision was made for wounded soldiers, and he could not work with his left arm alone, he set out to see his father. Unfortunately his father could only just support himself, and was forced to tell his son so; wherefore the Captain decided to go and apply for help in St. Petersburg, seeing that he had risked his life for his country, and had lost much blood in its service. You can imagine him arriving in the capital on a baggage waggon—in the capital which is like no other city in the world! Before him there lay spread out the whole field of life, like a sort of Arabian Nights—a picture made up of the Nevski Prospect, Gorokhovaia Street, countless tapering spires, and a number of bridges apparently supported on nothing—in fact, a regular second Nineveh. Well, he made shift to hire a lodging, but found everything so wonderfully furnished with blinds and Persian carpets and so forth that he saw it would mean throwing away a lot of money. True, as one walks the streets of St. Petersburg one seems to smell money by the thousand roubles, but our friend Kopeikin's bank was limited to a few score coppers and a little silver—not enough to buy a village with! At length, at the price of a rouble a day, he obtained a lodging in the sort of tavern where the daily ration is a bowl of cabbage soup and a crust of bread; and as he felt that he could not manage to live very long on fare of that kind he asked folk what he had better do. ‘What you had better do?’ they said. ‘Well the Government is not here—it is in Paris, and the troops have not yet returned from the war; but there is a TEMPORARY Commission sitting, and you had better go and see what IT can do for you.’ ‘All right!’ he said. ‘I will go and tell the Commission that I have shed my blood, and sacrificed my life, for my country.’ And he got up early one morning, and shaved himself with his left hand (since the expense of a barber was not worth while), and set out, wooden leg and all, to see the President of the Commission. But first he asked where the President lived, and was told that his house was in Naberezhnaia Street. And you may be sure that it was no peasant's hut, with its glazed windows and great mirrors and statues and lacqueys and brass door handles! Rather, it was the sort of place which you would enter only after you had bought a cheap cake of soap and indulged in a two hours' wash. Also, at the entrance there was posted a grand Swiss footman with a baton and an embroidered collar—a fellow looking like a fat, over-fed pug dog. However, friend Kopeikin managed to get himself and his wooden leg into the reception room, and there squeezed himself away into a corner, for fear lest he should knock down the gilded china with his elbow. And he stood waiting in great satisfaction at having arrived before the President had so much as left his bed and been served with his silver wash-basin. Nevertheless, it was only when Kopeikin had been waiting four hours that a breakfast waiter entered to say, ‘The President will soon be here.’ By now the room was as full of people as a plate is of beans, and when the President left the breakfast-room he brought with him, oh, such dignity and refinement, and such an air of the metropolis! First he walked up to one person, and then up to another, saying: ‘What do YOU want? And what do YOU want? What can I do for YOU? What is YOUR business?’ And at length he stopped before Kopeikin, and Kopeikin said to him: ‘I have shed my blood, and lost both an arm and a leg, for my country, and am unable to work. Might I therefore dare to ask you for a little help, if the regulations should permit of it, or for a gratuity, or for a pension, or something of the kind?’ Then the President looked at him, and saw that one of his legs was indeed a wooden one, and that an empty right sleeve was pinned to his uniform. ‘Very well,’ he said. ‘Come to me again in a few days' time.’ Upon this friend Kopeikin felt delighted. ‘NOW I have done my job!’ he thought to himself; and you may imagine how gaily he trotted along the pavement, and how he dropped into a tavern for a glass of vodka, and how he ordered a cutlet and some caper sauce and some other things for luncheon, and how he called for a bottle of wine, and how he went to the theatre in the evening! In short, he did himself thoroughly well. Next, he saw in the street a young English lady, as graceful as a swan, and set off after her on his wooden leg. ‘But no,’ he thought to himself. ‘To the devil with that sort of thing just now! I will wait until I have drawn my pension. For the present I have spent enough.’ (And I may tell you that by now he had got through fully half his money.) Two or three days later he went to see the President of the Commission again. ‘I should be glad to know,’ he said, ‘whether by now you can do anything for me in return for my having shed my blood and suffered sickness and wounds on military service.’ ‘First of all,’ said the President, ‘I must tell you that nothing can be decided in your case without the authority of the Supreme Government. Without that sanction we cannot move in the matter. Surely you see how things stand until the army shall have returned from the war? All that I can advise you to do is wait for the Minister to return, and, in the meanwhile, to have patience. Rest assured that then you will not be overlooked. And if for the moment you have nothing to live upon, this is the best that I can do for you.’ With that he handed Kopeikin a trifle until his case should have been decided. However, that was not what Kopeikin wanted. He had supposed that he would be given a gratuity of a thousand roubles straight away; whereas, instead of ‘Drink and be merry,’ it was ‘Wait, for the time is not yet.’ Thus, though his head had been full of soup plates and cutlets and English girls, he now descended the steps with his ears and his tail down— looking, in fact, like a poodle over which the cook has poured a bucketful of water. You see, St. Petersburg life had changed him not a little since first he had got a taste of it, and, now that the devil only knew how he was going to live, it came all the harder to him that he should have no more sweets to look forward to. Remember that a man in the prime of years has an appetite like a wolf; and as he passed a restaurant he could see a round-faced, holland-shirted, snow-white aproned fellow of a French chef preparing a dish delicious enough to make it turn to and eat itself; while, again, as he passed a fruit shop he could see delicacies looking out of a window for fools to come and buy them at a hundred roubles apiece. Imagine, therefore, his position! On the one hand, so to speak, were salmon and water-melons, while on the other hand was the bitter fare which passed at a tavern for luncheon. ‘Well,’ he thought to himself, ‘let them do what they like with me at the Commission, but I intend to go and raise the whole place, and to tell every blessed functionary there that I have a mind to do as I choose.’ And in truth this bold impertinence of a man did have the hardihood to return to the Commission. ‘What do you want?’ said the President. ‘Why are you here for the third time? You have had your orders given you.’ ‘I daresay I have,’ he retorted, ‘but I am not going to be put off with THEM. I want some cutlets to eat, and a bottle of French wine, and a chance to go and amuse myself at the theatre.’ ‘Pardon me,’ said the President. ‘What you really need (if I may venture to mention it) is a little patience. You have been given something for food until the Military Committee shall have met, and then, doubtless, you will receive your proper reward, seeing that it would not be seemly that a man who has served his country should be left destitute. On the other hand, if, in the meanwhile, you desire to indulge in cutlets and theatre-going, please understand that we cannot help you, but you must make your own resources, and try as best you can to help yourself.’ You can imagine that this went in at one of Kopeikin's ears, and out at the other; that it was like shooting peas at a stone wall. Accordingly he raised a turmoil which sent the staff flying. One by one, he gave the mob of secretaries and clerks a real good hammering. ‘You, and you, and you,’ he said, ‘do not even know your duties. You are law-breakers.’ Yes, he trod every man of them under foot. At length the General himself arrived from another office, and sounded the alarm. What was to be done with a fellow like Kopeikin? The President saw that strong measures were imperative. ‘Very well,’ he said. ‘Since you decline to rest satisfied with what has been given you, and quietly to await the decision of your case in St. Petersburg, I must find you a lodging. Here, constable, remove the man to gaol.’ Then a constable who had been called to the door—a constable three ells in height, and armed with a carbine—a man well fitted to guard a bank—placed our friend in a police waggon. ‘Well,’ reflected Kopeikin, ‘at least I shan't have to pay my fare for THIS ride. That's one comfort.’ Again, after he had ridden a little way, he said to himself: ‘they told me at the Commission to go and make my own means of enjoying myself. Very good. I'll do so.’ However, what became of Kopeikin, and whither he went, is known to no one. He sank, to use the poet's expression, into the waters of Lethe, and his doings now lie buried in oblivion. But allow me, gentlemen, to piece together the further threads of the story. Not two months later there appeared in the forests of Riazan a band of robbers: and of that band the chieftain was none other than—”

“Allow me,” put in the Head of the Police Department. “You have said that Kopeikin had lost an arm and a leg; whereas Chichikov—”

To say anything more was unnecessary. The Postmaster clapped his hand to his forehead, and publicly called himself a fool, though, later, he tried to excuse his mistake by saying that in England the science of mechanics had reached such a pitch that wooden legs were manufactured which would enable the wearer, on touching a spring, to vanish instantaneously from sight.

Various other theories were then propounded, among them a theory that Chichikov was Napoleon, escaped from St. Helena and travelling about the world in disguise. And if it should be supposed that no such notion could possibly have been broached, let the reader remember that these events took place not many years after the French had been driven out of Russia, and that various prophets had since declared that Napoleon was Antichrist, and would one day escape from his island prison to exercise universal sway on earth. Nay, some good folk had even declared the letters of Napoleon's name to constitute the Apocalyptic cipher!

As a last resort, the tchinovniks decided to question Nozdrev, since not only had the latter been the first to mention the dead souls, but also he was supposed to stand on terms of intimacy with Chichikov. Accordingly the Chief of Police dispatched a note by the hand of a commissionaire. At the time Nozdrev was engaged on some very important business—so much so that he had not left his room for four days, and was receiving his meals through the window, and no visitors at all. The business referred to consisted of the marking of several dozen selected cards in such a way as to permit of his relying upon them as upon his bosom friend. Naturally he did not like having his retirement invaded, and at first consigned the commissionaire to the devil; but as soon as he learnt from the note that, since a novice at cards was to be the guest of the Chief of Police that evening, a call at the latter's house might prove not wholly unprofitable he relented, unlocked the door of his room, threw on the first garments that came to hand, and set forth. To every question put to him by the tchinovniks he answered firmly and with assurance. Chichikov, he averred, had indeed purchased dead souls, and to the tune of several thousand roubles. In fact, he (Nozdrev) had himself sold him some, and still saw no reason why he should not have done so. Next, to the question of whether or not he considered Chichikov to be a spy, he replied in the affirmative, and added that, as long ago as his and Chichikov's joint schooldays, the said Chichikov had been known as “The Informer,” and repeatedly been thrashed by his companions on that account. Again, to the question of whether or not Chichikov was a forger of currency notes the deponent, as before, responded in the affirmative, and appended thereto an anecdote illustrative of Chichikov's extraordinary dexterity of hand—namely, an anecdote to that effect that, once upon a time, on learning that two million roubles worth of counterfeit notes were lying in Chichikov's house, the authorities had placed seals upon the building, and had surrounded it on every side with an armed guard; whereupon Chichikov had, during the night, changed each of these seals for a new one, and also so arranged matters that, when the house was searched, the forged notes were found to be genuine ones!

Again, to the question of whether or not Chichikov had schemed to abduct the Governor's daughter, and also whether it was true that he, Nozdrev, had undertaken to aid and abet him in the act, the witness replied that, had he not undertaken to do so, the affair would never have come off. At this point the witness pulled himself up, on realising that he had told a lie which might get him into trouble; but his tongue was not to be denied—the details trembling on its tip were too alluring, and he even went on to cite the name of the village church where the pair had arranged to be married, that of the priest who had performed the ceremony, the amount of the fees paid for the same (seventy-five roubles), and statements that the priest had refused to solemnise the wedding until Chichikov had frightened him by threatening to expose the fact that he (the priest) had married Mikhail, a local corn dealer, to his paramour, and that Chichikov had ordered both a koliaska for the couple's conveyance and relays of horses from the post-houses on the road. Nay, the narrative, as detailed by Nozdrev, even reached the point of his mentioning certain of the postillions by name! Next, the tchinovniks sounded him on the question of Chichikov's possible identity with Napoleon; but before long they had reason to regret the step, for Nozdrev responded with a rambling rigmarole such as bore no resemblance to anything possibly conceivable. Finally, the majority of the audience left the room, and only the Chief of Police remained to listen (in the hope of gathering something more); but at last even he found himself forced to disclaim the speaker with a gesture which said: “The devil only knows what the fellow is talking about!” and so voiced the general opinion that it was no use trying to gather figs of thistles.

Meanwhile Chichikov knew nothing of these events; for, having contracted a slight chill, coupled with a sore throat, he had decided to keep his room for three days; during which time he gargled his throat with milk and fig juice, consumed the fruit from which the juice had been extracted, and wore around his neck a poultice of camomile and camphor. Also, to while away the hours, he made new and more detailed lists of the souls which he had bought, perused a work by the Duchesse de la Vallière , rummaged in his portmanteau, looked through various articles and papers which he discovered in his dispatch-box, and found every one of these occupations tedious. Nor could he understand why none of his official friends had come to see him and inquire after his health, seeing that, not long since, there had been standing in front of the inn the drozhkis both of the Postmaster, the Public Prosecutor, and the President of the Council. He wondered and wondered, and then, with a shrug of his shoulders, fell to pacing the room. At length he felt better, and his spirits rose at the prospect of once more going out into the fresh air; wherefore, having shaved a plentiful growth of hair from his face, he dressed with such alacrity as almost to cause a split in his trousers, sprinkled himself with eau-de-Cologne, and wrapping himself in warm clothes, and turning up the collar of his coat, sallied forth into the street. His first destination was intended to be the Governor's mansion, and, as he walked along, certain thoughts concerning the Governor's daughter would keep whirling through his head, so that almost he forgot where he was, and took to smiling and cracking jokes to himself.

Arrived at the Governor's entrance, he was about to divest himself of his scarf when a Swiss footman greeted him with the words, “I am forbidden to admit you.”

“What?” he exclaimed. “You do not know me? Look at me again, and see if you do not recognise me.”

“Of course I recognise you,” the footman replied. “I have seen you before, but have been ordered to admit any one else rather than Monsieur Chichikov.”

“Indeed? And why so?”

“Those are my orders, and they must be obeyed,” said the footman, confronting Chichikov with none of that politeness with which, on former occasions, he had hastened to divest our hero of his wrappings. Evidently he was of opinion that, since the gentry declined to receive the visitor, the latter must certainly be a rogue.

“I cannot understand it,” said Chichikov to himself. Then he departed, and made his way to the house of the President of the Council. But so put about was that official by Chichikov's entry that he could not utter two consecutive words—he could only murmur some rubbish which left both his visitor and himself out of countenance. Chichikov wondered, as he left the house, what the President's muttered words could have meant, but failed to make head or tail of them. Next, he visited, in turn, the Chief of Police, the Vice-Governor, the Postmaster, and others; but in each case he either failed to be accorded admittance or was received so strangely, and with such a measure of constraint and conversational awkwardness and absence of mind and embarrassment, that he began to fear for the sanity of his hosts. Again and again did he strive to divine the cause, but could not do so; so he went wandering aimlessly about the town, without succeeding in making up his mind whether he or the officials had gone crazy. At length, in a state bordering upon bewilderment, he returned to the inn—to the establishment whence, that every afternoon, he had set forth in such exuberance of spirits. Feeling the need of something to do, he ordered tea, and, still marvelling at the strangeness of his position, was about to pour out the beverage when the door opened and Nozdrev made his appearance.

“What says the proverb?” he began. “‘To see a friend, seven versts is not too long a round to make.’ I happened to be passing the house, saw a light in your window, and thought to myself: ‘Now, suppose I were to run up and pay him a visit? It is unlikely that he will be asleep.’ Ah, ha! I see tea on your table! Good! Then I will drink a cup with you, for I had wretched stuff for dinner, and it is beginning to lie heavy on my stomach. Also, tell your man to fill me a pipe. Where is your own pipe?”

“I never smoke,” rejoined Chichikov drily.

“Rubbish! As if I did not know what a chimney-pot you are! What is your man's name? Hi, Vakhramei! Come here!”

“Petrushka is his name, not Vakhramei.”

“Indeed? But you USED to have a man called Vakhramei, didn't you?”

“No, never.”

“Oh, well. Then it must be Derebin's man I am thinking of. What a lucky fellow that Derebin is! An aunt of his has gone and quarrelled with her son for marrying a serf woman, and has left all her property to HIM, to Derebin. Would that I had an aunt of that kind to provide against future contingencies! But why have you been hiding yourself away? I suppose the reason has been that you go in for abstruse subjects and are fond of reading” (why Nozdrev should have drawn these conclusions no one could possibly have said—least of all Chichikov himself). “By the way, I can tell you of something that would have found you scope for your satirical vein” (the conclusion as to Chichikov's “satirical vein” was, as before, altogether unwarranted on Nozdrev's part). “That is to say, you would have seen merchant Likhachev losing a pile of money at play. My word, you would have laughed! A fellow with me named Perependev said: ‘Would that Chichikov had been here! It would have been the very thing for him!’” (As a matter of fact, never since the day of his birth had Nozdrev met any one of the name of Perependev.) “However, my friend, you must admit that you treated me rather badly the day that we played that game of chess; but, as I won the game, I bear you no malice. A propos, I am just from the President's, and ought to tell you that the feeling against you in the town is very strong, for every one believes you to be a forger of currency notes. I myself was sent for and questioned about you, but I stuck up for you through thick and thin, and told the tchinovniks that I had been at school with you, and had known your father. In fact, I gave the fellows a knock or two for themselves.”

“You say that I am believed to be a forger?” said Chichikov, starting from his seat.

“Yes,” said Nozdrev. “Why have you gone and frightened everybody as you have done? Some of our folk are almost out of their minds about it, and declare you to be either a brigand in disguise or a spy. Yesterday the Public Prosecutor even died of it, and is to be buried to-morrow” (this was true in so far as that, on the previous day, the official in question had had a fatal stroke—probably induced by the excitement of the public meeting). “Of course, I don't suppose you to be anything of the kind, but, you see, these fellows are in a blue funk about the new Governor-General, for they think he will make trouble for them over your affair. A propos, he is believed to be a man who puts on airs, and turns up his nose at everything; and if so, he will get on badly with the dvoriané, seeing that fellows of that sort need to be humoured a bit. Yes, my word! Should the new Governor-General shut himself up in his study, and give no balls, there will be the very devil to pay! By the way, Chichikov, that is a risky scheme of yours.”

“What scheme to you mean?” Chichikov asked uneasily.

“Why, that scheme of carrying off the Governor's daughter. However, to tell the truth, I was expecting something of the kind. No sooner did I see you and her together at the ball than I said to myself: ‘Ah, ha! Chichikov is not here for nothing!’ For my own part, I think you have made a poor choice, for I can see nothing in her at all. On the other hand, the niece of a friend of mine named Bikusov—she IS a girl, and no mistake! A regular what you might call ‘miracle in muslin!’”

“What on earth are you talking about?” asked Chichikov with his eyes distended. “HOW could I carry off the Governor's daughter? What on earth do you mean?”

“Come, come! What a secretive fellow you are! My only object in having come to see you is to lend you a helping hand in the matter. Look here. On condition that you will lend me three thousand roubles, I will stand you the cost of the wedding, the koliaska, and the relays of horses. I must have the money even if I die for it.”

Throughout Nozdrev's maunderings Chichikov had been rubbing his eyes to ascertain whether or not he was dreaming. What with the charge of being a forger, the accusation of having schemed an abduction, the death of the Public Prosecutor (whatever might have been its cause), and the advent of a new Governor-General, he felt utterly dismayed.

“Things having come to their present pass,” he reflected, “I had better not linger here—I had better be off at once.”

Getting rid of Nozdrev as soon as he could, he sent for Selifan, and ordered him to be up at daybreak, in order to clean the britchka and to have everything ready for a start at six o'clock. Yet, though Selifan replied, “Very well, Paul Ivanovitch,” he hesitated awhile by the door. Next, Chichikov bid Petrushka get out the dusty portmanteau from under the bed, and then set to work to cram into it, pell-mell, socks, shirts, collars (both clean and dirty), boot trees, a calendar, and a variety of other articles. Everything went into the receptacle just as it came to hand, since his one object was to obviate any possible delay in the morning's departure. Meanwhile the reluctant Selifan slowly, very slowly, left the room, as slowly descended the staircase (on each separate step of which he left a muddy foot-print), and, finally, halted to scratch his head. What that scratching may have meant no one could say; for, with the Russian populace, such a scratching may mean any one of a hundred things.





CHAPTER XI


Nevertheless events did not turn out as Chichikov had intended they should. In the first place, he overslept himself. That was check number one. In the second place, on his rising and inquiring whether the britchka had been harnessed and everything got ready, he was informed that neither of those two things had been done. That was check number two. Beside himself with rage, he prepared to give Selifan the wigging of his life, and, meanwhile, waited impatiently to hear what the delinquent had got to say in his defence. It goes without saying that when Selifan made his appearance in the doorway he had only the usual excuses to offer—the sort of excuses usually offered by servants when a hasty departure has become imperatively necessary.

“Paul Ivanovitch,” he said, “the horses require shoeing.”

“Blockhead!” exclaimed Chichikov. “Why did you not tell me of that before, you damned fool? Was there not time enough for them to be shod?”

“Yes, I suppose there was,” agreed Selifan. “Also one of the wheels is in want of a new tyre, for the roads are so rough that the old tyre is worn through. Also, the body of the britchka is so rickety that probably it will not last more than a couple of stages.”

“Rascal!” shouted Chichikov, clenching his fists and approaching Selifan in such a manner that, fearing to receive a blow, the man backed and dodged aside.

“Do you mean to ruin me, and to break all our bones on the road, you cursed idiot? For these three weeks past you have been doing nothing at all; yet now, at the last moment, you come here stammering and playing the fool! Do you think I keep you just to eat and to drive yourself about? You must have known of this before? Did you, or did you not, know it? Answer me at once.”

“Yes, I did know it,” replied Selifan, hanging his head.

“Then why didn't you tell me about it?” Selifan had no reply immediately ready, so continued to hang his head while quietly saying to himself: “See how well I have managed things! I knew what was the matter, yet I did not say.”

“And now,” continued Chichikov, “go you at once and fetch a blacksmith. Tell him that everything must be put right within two hours at the most. Do you hear? If that should not be done, I, I—I will give you the best flogging that ever you had in your life.” Truly Chichikov was almost beside himself with fury.

Turning towards the door, as though for the purpose of going and carrying out his orders, Selifan halted and added: “That skewbald, barin—you might think it well to sell him, seeing that he is nothing but a rascal? A horse like that is more of a hindrance than a help.”

“What? Do you expect me to go NOW to the market-place and sell him?”

“Well, Paul Ivanovitch, he is good for nothing but show, since by nature he is a most cunning beast. Never in my life have I seen such a horse.”

“Fool! Whenever I may wish to sell him I SHALL sell him. Meanwhile, don't you trouble your head about what doesn't concern you, but go and fetch a blacksmith, and see that everything is put right within two hours. Otherwise I will take the very hair off your head, and beat you till you haven't a face left. Be off! Hurry!”

Selifan departed, and Chichikov, his ill-humour vented, threw down upon the floor the poignard which he always took with him as a means of instilling respect into whomsoever it might concern, and spent the next quarter of an hour in disputing with a couple of blacksmiths—men who, as usual, were rascals of the type which, on perceiving that something is wanted in a hurry, at once multiplies its terms for providing the same. Indeed, for all Chichikov's storming and raging as he dubbed the fellows robbers and extortioners and thieves, he could make no impression upon the pair, since, true to their character, they declined to abate their prices, and, even when they had begun their work, spent upon it, not two hours, but five and a half. Meanwhile he had the satisfaction of experiencing that delightful time with which all travellers are familiar—namely, the time during which one sits in a room where, except for a litter of string, waste paper, and so forth, everything else has been packed. But to all things there comes an end, and there arrived also the long-awaited moment when the britchka had received the luggage, the faulty wheel had been fitted with a new tyre, the horses had been re-shod, and the predatory blacksmiths had departed with their gains. “Thank God!” thought Chichikov as the britchka rolled out of the gates of the inn, and the vehicle began to jolt over the cobblestones. Yet a feeling which he could not altogether have defined filled his breast as he gazed upon the houses and the streets and the garden walls which he might never see again. Presently, on turning a corner, the britchka was brought to a halt through the fact that along the street there was filing a seemingly endless funeral procession. Leaning forward in his britchka, Chichikov asked Petrushka whose obsequies the procession represented, and was told that they represented those of the Public Prosecutor. Disagreeably shocked, our hero hastened to raise the hood of the vehicle, to draw the curtains across the windows, and to lean back into a corner. While the britchka remained thus halted Selifan and Petrushka, their caps doffed, sat watching the progress of the cortege, after they had received strict instructions not to greet any fellow-servant whom they might recognise. Behind the hearse walked the whole body of tchinovniks, bareheaded; and though, for a moment or two, Chichikov feared that some of their number might discern him in his britchka, he need not have disturbed himself, since their attention was otherwise engaged. In fact, they were not even exchanging the small talk customary among members of such processions, but thinking exclusively of their own affairs, of the advent of the new Governor-General, and of the probable manner in which he would take up the reins of administration. Next came a number of carriages, from the windows of which peered the ladies in mourning toilets. Yet the movements of their hands and lips made it evident that they were indulging in animated conversation—probably about the Governor-General, the balls which he might be expected to give, and their own eternal fripperies and gewgaws. Lastly came a few empty drozhkis. As soon as the latter had passed, our hero was able to continue on his way. Throwing back the hood of the britchka, he said to himself:

“Ah, good friend, you have lived your life, and now it is over! In the newspapers they will say of you that you died regretted not only by your subordinates, but also by humanity at large, as well as that, a respected citizen, a kind father, and a husband beyond reproach, you went to your grave amid the tears of your widow and orphans. Yet, should those journals be put to it to name any particular circumstance which justified this eulogy of you, they would be forced to fall back upon the fact that you grew a pair of exceptionally thick eyebrows!”

With that Chichikov bid Selifan quicken his pace, and concluded: “After all, it is as well that I encountered the procession, for they say that to meet a funeral is lucky.”

Presently the britchka turned into some less frequented streets, lines of wooden fencing of the kind which mark the outskirts of a town began to file by, the cobblestones came to an end, the macadam of the highroad succeeded to them, and once more there began on either side of the turnpike a procession of verst stones, road menders, and grey villages; inns with samovars and peasant women and landlords who came running out of yards with seivefuls of oats; pedestrians in worn shoes which, it might be, had covered eight hundred versts; little towns, bright with booths for the sale of flour in barrels, boots, small loaves, and other trifles; heaps of slag; much repaired bridges; expanses of field to right and to left; stout landowners; a mounted soldier bearing a green, iron-clamped box inscribed: “The —th Battery of Artillery”; long strips of freshly-tilled earth which gleamed green, yellow, and black on the face of the countryside. With it mingled long-drawn singing, glimpses of elm-tops amid mist, the far-off notes of bells, endless clouds of rocks, and the illimitable line of the horizon.

Ah, Russia, Russia, from my beautiful home in a strange land I can still see you! In you everything is poor and disordered and unhomely; in you the eye is neither cheered nor dismayed by temerities of nature which a yet more temerarious art has conquered; in you one beholds no cities with lofty, manywindowed mansions, lofty as crags, no picturesque trees, no ivy-clad ruins, no waterfalls with their everlasting spray and roar, no beetling precipices which confuse the brain with their stony immensity, no vistas of vines and ivy and millions of wild roses and ageless lines of blue hills which look almost unreal against the clear, silvery background of the sky. In you everything is flat and open; your towns project like points or signals from smooth levels of plain, and nothing whatsoever enchants or deludes the eye. Yet what secret, what invincible force draws me to you? Why does there ceaselessly echo and re-echo in my ears the sad song which hovers throughout the length and the breadth of your borders? What is the burden of that song? Why does it wail and sob and catch at my heart? What say the notes which thus painfully caress and embrace my soul, and flit, uttering their lamentations, around me? What is it you seek of me, O Russia? What is the hidden bond which subsists between us? Why do you regard me as you do? Why does everything within you turn upon me eyes full of yearning? Even at this moment, as I stand dumbly, fixedly, perplexedly contemplating your vastness, a menacing cloud, charged with gathering rain, seems to overshadow my head. What is it that your boundless expanses presage? Do they not presage that one day there will arise in you ideas as boundless as yourself? Do they not presage that one day you too will know no limits? Do they not presage that one day, when again you shall have room for their exploits, there will spring to life the heroes of old? How the power of your immensity enfolds me, and reverberates through all my being with a wild, strange spell, and flashes in my eyes with an almost supernatural radiance! Yes, a strange, brilliant, unearthly vista indeed do you disclose, O Russia, country of mine!

“Stop, stop, you fool!” shouted Chichikov to Selifan; and even as he spoke a troika, bound on Government business, came chattering by, and disappeared in a cloud of dust. To Chichikov's curses at Selifan for not having drawn out of the way with more alacrity a rural constable with moustaches of the length of an arshin added his quota.

What a curious and attractive, yet also what an unreal, fascination the term “highway” connotes! And how interesting for its own sake is a highway! Should the day be a fine one (though chilly) in mellowing autumn, press closer your travelling cloak, and draw down your cap over your ears, and snuggle cosily, comfortably into a corner of the britchka before a last shiver shall course through your limbs, and the ensuing warmth shall put to flight the autumnal cold and damp. As the horses gallop on their way, how delightfully will drowsiness come stealing upon you, and make your eyelids droop! For a while, through your somnolence, you will continue to hear the hard breathing of the team and the rumbling of the wheels; but at length, sinking back into your corner, you will relapse into the stage of snoring. And when you awake—behold! you will find that five stages have slipped away, and that the moon is shining, and that you have reached a strange town of churches and old wooden cupolas and blackened spires and white, half-timbered houses! And as the moonlight glints hither and thither, almost you will believe that the walls and the streets and the pavements of the place are spread with sheets— sheets shot with coal-black shadows which make the wooden roofs look all the brighter under the slanting beams of the pale luminary. Nowhere is a soul to be seen, for every one is plunged in slumber. Yet no. In a solitary window a light is flickering where some good burgher is mending his boots, or a baker drawing a batch of dough. O night and powers of heaven, how perfect is the blackness of your infinite vault—how lofty, how remote its inaccessible depths where it lies spread in an intangible, yet audible, silence! Freshly does the lulling breath of night blow in your face, until once more you relapse into snoring oblivion, and your poor neighbour turns angrily in his corner as he begins to be conscious of your weight. Then again you awake, but this time to find yourself confronted with only fields and steppes. Everywhere in the ascendant is the desolation of space. But suddenly the ciphers on a verst stone leap to the eye! Morning is rising, and on the chill, gradually paling line of the horizon you can see gleaming a faint gold streak. The wind freshens and grows keener, and you snuggle closer in your cloak; yet how glorious is that freshness, and how marvellous the sleep in which once again you become enfolded! A jolt!—and for the last time you return to consciousness. By now the sun is high in the heavens, and you hear a voice cry “gently, gently!” as a farm waggon issues from a by-road. Below, enclosed within an ample dike, stretches a sheet of water which glistens like copper in the sunlight. Beyond, on the side of a slope, lie some scattered peasants' huts, a manor house, and, flanking the latter, a village church with its cross flashing like a star. There also comes wafted to your ear the sound of peasants' laughter, while in your inner man you are becoming conscious of an appetite which is not to be withstood. Oh long-drawn highway, how excellent you are! How often have I in weariness and despondency set forth upon your length, and found in you salvation and rest! How often, as I followed your leading, have I been visited with wonderful thoughts and poetic dreams and curious, wild impressions!

At this moment our friend Chichikov also was experiencing visions of a not wholly prosaic nature. Let us peep into his soul and share them. At first he remained unconscious of anything whatsoever, for he was too much engaged in making sure that he was really clear of the town; but as soon as he saw that it had completely disappeared, with its mills and factories and other urban appurtenances, and that even the steeples of the white stone churches had sunk below the horizon, he turned his attention to the road, and the town of N. vanished from his thoughts as completely as though he had not seen it since childhood. Again, in its turn, the road ceased to interest him, and he began to close his eyes and to loll his head against the cushions. Of this let the author take advantage, in order to speak at length concerning his hero; since hitherto he (the author) has been prevented from so doing by Nozdrev and balls and ladies and local intrigues—by those thousand trifles which seem trifles only when they are introduced into a book, but which, in life, figure as affairs of importance. Let us lay them aside, and betake ourselves to business.

Whether the character whom I have selected for my hero has pleased my readers is, of course, exceedingly doubtful. At all events the ladies will have failed to approve him for the fair sex demands in a hero perfection, and, should there be the least mental or physical stain on him—well, woe betide! Yes, no matter how profoundly the author may probe that hero's soul, no matter how clearly he may portray his figure as in a mirror, he will be given no credit for the achievement. Indeed, Chichikov's very stoutness and plenitude of years may have militated against him, for never is a hero pardoned for the former, and the majority of ladies will, in such case, turn away, and mutter to themselves: “Phew! What a beast!” Yes, the author is well aware of this. Yet, though he could not, to save his life, take a person of virtue for his principal character, it may be that this story contains themes never before selected, and that in it there projects the whole boundless wealth of Russian psychology; that it portrays, as well as Chichikov, the peasant who is gifted with the virtues which God has sent him, and the marvellous maiden of Russia who has not her like in all the world for her beautiful feminine spirituality, the roots of which lie buried in noble aspirations and boundless self-denial. In fact, compared with these types, the virtuous of other races seem lifeless, as does an inanimate volume when compared with the living word. Yes, each time that there arises in Russia a movement of thought, it becomes clear that the movement sinks deep into the Slavonic nature where it would but have skimmed the surface of other nations.—But why am I talking like this? Whither am I tending? It is indeed shameful that an author who long ago reached man's estate, and was brought up to a course of severe introspection and sober, solitary self-enlightenment, should give way to such jejune wandering from the point. To everything its proper time and place and turn. As I was saying, it does not lie in me to take a virtuous character for my hero: and I will tell you why. It is because it is high time that a rest were given to the “poor, but virtuous” individual; it is because the phrase “a man of worth” has grown into a by-word; it is because the “man of worth” has become converted into a horse, and there is not a writer but rides him and flogs him, in and out of season; it is because the “man of worth” has been starved until he has not a shred of his virtue left, and all that remains of his body is but the ribs and the hide; it is because the “man of worth” is for ever being smuggled upon the scene; it is because the “man of worth” has at length forfeited every one's respect. For these reasons do I reaffirm that it is high time to yoke a rascal to the shafts. Let us yoke that rascal.

Our hero's beginnings were both modest and obscure. True, his parents were dvoriané, but he in no way resembled them. At all events, a short, squab female relative who was present at his birth exclaimed as she lifted up the baby: “He is altogether different from what I had expected him to be. He ought to have taken after his maternal grandmother, whereas he has been born, as the proverb has it, ‘like not father nor mother, but like a chance passerby.’” Thus from the first life regarded the little Chichikov with sour distaste, and as through a dim, frost-encrusted window. A tiny room with diminutive casements which were never opened, summer or winter; an invalid father in a dressing-gown lined with lambskin, and with an ailing foot swathed in bandages—a man who was continually drawing deep breaths, and walking up and down the room, and spitting into a sandbox; a period of perpetually sitting on a bench with pen in hand and ink on lips and fingers; a period of being eternally confronted with the copy-book maxim, “Never tell a lie, but obey your superiors, and cherish virtue in your heart;” an everlasting scraping and shuffling of slippers up and down the room; a period of continually hearing a well-known, strident voice exclaim: “So you have been playing the fool again!” at times when the child, weary of the mortal monotony of his task, had added a superfluous embellishment to his copy; a period of experiencing the ever-familiar, but ever-unpleasant, sensation which ensued upon those words as the boy's ear was painfully twisted between two long fingers bent backwards at the tips—such is the miserable picture of that youth of which, in later life, Chichikov preserved but the faintest of memories! But in this world everything is liable to swift and sudden change; and, one day in early spring, when the rivers had melted, the father set forth with his little son in a teliezshka drawn by a sorrel steed of the kind known to horsy folk as a soroka, and having as coachman the diminutive hunchback who, father of the only serf family belonging to the elder Chichikov, served as general factotum in the Chichikov establishment. For a day and a half the soroka conveyed them on their way; during which time they spent the night at a roadside inn, crossed a river, dined off cold pie and roast mutton, and eventually arrived at the county town. To the lad the streets presented a spectacle of unwonted brilliancy, and he gaped with amazement. Turning into a side alley wherein the mire necessitated both the most strenuous exertions on the soroka's part and the most vigorous castigation on the part of the driver and the barin, the conveyance eventually reached the gates of a courtyard which, combined with a small fruit garden containing various bushes, a couple of apple-trees in blossom, and a mean, dirty little shed, constituted the premises attached to an antiquated-looking villa. Here there lived a relative of the Chichikovs, a wizened old lady who went to market in person and dried her stockings at the samovar. On seeing the boy, she patted his cheek and expressed satisfaction at his physique; whereupon the fact became disclosed that here he was to abide for a while, for the purpose of attending a local school. After a night's rest his father prepared to betake himself homeward again; but no tears marked the parting between him and his son, he merely gave the lad a copper or two and (a far more important thing) the following injunctions. “See here, my boy. Do your lessons well, do not idle or play the fool, and above all things, see that you please your teachers. So long as you observe these rules you will make progress, and surpass your fellows, even if God shall have denied you brains, and you should fail in your studies. Also, do not consort overmuch with your comrades, for they will do you no good; but, should you do so, then make friends with the richer of them, since one day they may be useful to you. Also, never entertain or treat any one, but see that every one entertains and treats YOU. Lastly, and above all else, keep and save your every kopeck. To save money is the most important thing in life. Always a friend or a comrade may fail you, and be the first to desert you in a time of adversity; but never will a KOPECK fail you, whatever may be your plight. Nothing in the world cannot be done, cannot be attained, with the aid of money.” These injunctions given, the father embraced his son, and set forth on his return; and though the son never again beheld his parent, the latter's words and precepts sank deep into the little Chichikov's soul.

The next day young Pavlushka made his first attendance at school. But no special aptitude in any branch of learning did he display. Rather, his distinguishing characteristics were diligence and neatness. On the other hand, he developed great intelligence as regards the PRACTICAL aspect of life. In a trice he divined and comprehended how things ought to be worked, and, from that time forth, bore himself towards his school-fellows in such a way that, though they frequently gave him presents, he not only never returned the compliment, but even on occasions pocketed the gifts for the mere purpose of selling them again. Also, boy though he was, he acquired the art of self-denial. Of the trifle which his father had given him on parting he spent not a kopeck, but, the same year, actually added to his little store by fashioning a bullfinch of wax, painting it, and selling the same at a handsome profit. Next, as time went on, he engaged in other speculations—in particular, in the scheme of buying up eatables, taking his seat in class beside boys who had plenty of pocket-money, and, as soon as such opulent individuals showed signs of failing attention (and, therefore, of growing appetite), tendering them, from beneath the desk, a roll of pudding or a piece of gingerbread, and charging according to degree of appetite and size of portion. He also spent a couple of months in training a mouse, which he kept confined in a little wooden cage in his bedroom. At length, when the training had reached the point that, at the several words of command, the mouse would stand upon its hind legs, lie down, and get up again, he sold the creature for a respectable sum. Thus, in time, his gains attained the amount of five roubles; whereupon he made himself a purse and then started to fill a second receptacle of the kind. Still more studied was his attitude towards the authorities. No one could sit more quietly in his place on the bench than he. In the same connection it may be remarked that his teacher was a man who, above all things, loved peace and good behaviour, and simply could not abide clever, witty boys, since he suspected them of laughing at him. Consequently any lad who had once attracted the master's attention with a manifestation of intelligence needed but to shuffle in his place, or unintentionally to twitch an eyebrow, for the said master at once to burst into a rage, to turn the supposed offender out of the room, and to visit him with unmerciful punishment. “Ah, my fine fellow,” he would say, “I'll cure you of your impudence and want of respect! I know you through and through far better than you know yourself, and will take good care that you have to go down upon your knees and curb your appetite.” Whereupon the wretched lad would, for no cause of which he was aware, be forced to wear out his breeches on the floor and go hungry for days. “Talents and gifts,” the schoolmaster would declare, “are so much rubbish. I respect only good behaviour, and shall award full marks to those who conduct themselves properly, even if they fail to learn a single letter of their alphabet: whereas to those in whom I may perceive a tendency to jocularity I shall award nothing, even though they should outdo Solon himself.” For the same reason he had no great love of the author Krylov, in that the latter says in one of his Fables: “In my opinion, the more one sings, the better one works;” and often the pedagogue would relate how, in a former school of his, the silence had been such that a fly could be heard buzzing on the wing, and for the space of a whole year not a single pupil sneezed or coughed in class, and so complete was the absence of all sound that no one could have told that there was a soul in the place. Of this mentor young Chichikov speedily appraised the mentality; wherefore he fashioned his behaviour to correspond with it. Not an eyelid, not an eyebrow, would he stir during school hours, howsoever many pinches he might receive from behind; and only when the bell rang would he run to anticipate his fellows in handing the master the three-cornered cap which that dignitary customarily sported, and then to be the first to leave the class-room, and contrive to meet the master not less than two or three times as the latter walked homeward, in order that, on each occasion, he might doff his cap. And the scheme proved entirely successful. Throughout the period of his attendance at school he was held in high favour, and, on leaving the establishment, received full marks for every subject, as well as a diploma and a book inscribed (in gilt letters) “For Exemplary Diligence and the Perfection of Good Conduct.” By this time he had grown into a fairly good-looking youth of the age when the chin first calls for a razor; and at about the same period his father died, leaving behind him, as his estate, four waistcoats completely worn out, two ancient frockcoats, and a small sum of money. Apparently he had been skilled only in RECOMMENDING the saving of kopecks—not in ACTUALLY PRACTISING the art. Upon that Chichikov sold the old house and its little parcel of land for a thousand roubles, and removed, with his one serf and the serf's family, to the capital, where he set about organising a new establishment and entering the Civil Service. Simultaneously with his doing so, his old schoolmaster lost (through stupidity or otherwise) the establishment over which he had hitherto presided, and in which he had set so much store by silence and good behaviour. Grief drove him to drink, and when nothing was left, even for that purpose, he retired—ill, helpless, and starving—into a broken-down, cheerless hovel. But certain of his former pupils—the same clever, witty lads whom he had once been wont to accuse of impertinence and evil conduct generally—heard of his pitiable plight, and collected for him what money they could, even to the point of selling their own necessaries. Only Chichikov, when appealed to, pleaded inability, and compromised with a contribution of a single piatak: which his old schoolfellows straightway returned him—full in the face, and accompanied with a shout of “Oh, you skinflint!” As for the poor schoolmaster, when he heard what his former pupils had done, he buried his face in his hands, and the tears gushed from his failing eyes as from those of a helpless infant. “God has brought you but to weep over my death-bed,” he murmured feebly; and added with a profound sigh, on hearing of Chichikov's conduct: “Ah, Pavlushka, how a human being may become changed! Once you were a good lad, and gave me no trouble; but now you are become proud indeed!”

Yet let it not be inferred from this that our hero's character had grown so blase and hard, or his conscience so blunted, as to preclude his experiencing a particle of sympathy or compassion. As a matter of fact, he was capable both of the one and the other, and would have been glad to assist his old teacher had no great sum been required, or had he not been called upon to touch the fund which he had decided should remain intact. In other words, the father's injunction, “Guard and save every kopeck,” had become a hard and fast rule of the son's. Yet the youth had no particular attachment to money for money's sake; he was not possessed with the true instinct for hoarding and niggardliness. Rather, before his eyes there floated ever a vision of life and its amenities and advantages—a vision of carriages and an elegantly furnished house and recherche dinners; and it was in the hope that some day he might attain these things that he saved every kopeck and, meanwhile, stinted both himself and others. Whenever a rich man passed him by in a splendid drozhki drawn by swift and handsomely-caparisoned horses, he would halt as though deep in thought, and say to himself, like a man awakening from a long sleep: “That gentleman must have been a financier, he has so little hair on his brow.” In short, everything connected with wealth and plenty produced upon him an ineffaceable impression. Even when he left school he took no holiday, so strong in him was the desire to get to work and enter the Civil Service. Yet, for all the encomiums contained in his diploma, he had much ado to procure a nomination to a Government Department; and only after a long time was a minor post found for him, at a salary of thirty or fourty roubles a year. Nevertheless, wretched though this appointment was, he determined, by strict attention to business, to overcome all obstacles, and to win success. And, indeed, the self-denial, the patience, and the economy which he displayed were remarkable. From early morn until late at night he would, with indefatigable zeal of body and mind, remain immersed in his sordid task of copying official documents—never going home, snatching what sleep he could on tables in the building, and dining with the watchman on duty. Yet all the while he contrived to remain clean and neat, to preserve a cheerful expression of countenance, and even to cultivate a certain elegance of movement. In passing, it may be remarked that his fellow tchinovniks were a peculiarly plain, unsightly lot, some of them having faces like badly baked bread, swollen cheeks, receding chins, and cracked and blistered upper lips. Indeed, not a man of them was handsome. Also, their tone of voice always contained a note of sullenness, as though they had a mind to knock some one on the head; and by their frequent sacrifices to Bacchus they showed that even yet there remains in the Slavonic nature a certain element of paganism. Nay, the Director's room itself they would invade while still licking their lips, and since their breath was not over-aromatic, the atmosphere of the room grew not over-pleasant. Naturally, among such an official staff a man like Chichikov could not fail to attract attention and remark, since in everything— in cheerfulness of demeanour, in suavity of voice, and in complete neglect of the use of strong potions—he was the absolute antithesis of his companions. Yet his path was not an easy one to tread, for over him he had the misfortune to have placed in authority a Chief Clerk who was a graven image of elderly insensibility and inertia. Always the same, always unapproachable, this functionary could never in his life have smiled or asked civilly after an acquaintance's health. Nor had any one ever seen him a whit different in the street or at his own home from what he was in the office, or showing the least interest in anything whatever, or getting drunk and relapsing into jollity in his cups, or indulging in that species of wild gaiety which, when intoxicated, even a burglar affects. No, not a particle of this was there in him. Nor, for that matter, was there in him a particle of anything at all, whether good or bad: which complete negativeness of character produced rather a strange effect. In the same way, his wizened, marble-like features reminded one of nothing in particular, so primly proportioned were they. Only the numerous pockmarks and dimples with which they were pitted placed him among the number of those over whose faces, to quote the popular saying, “The Devil has walked by night to grind peas.” In short, it would seem that no human agency could have approached such a man and gained his goodwill. Yet Chichikov made the effort. As a first step, he took to consulting the other's convenience in all manner of insignificant trifles—to cleaning his pens carefully, and, when they had been prepared exactly to the Chief Clerk's liking, laying them ready at his elbow; to dusting and sweeping from his table all superfluous sand and tobacco ash; to procuring a new mat for his inkstand; to looking for his hat—the meanest-looking hat that ever the world beheld—and having it ready for him at the exact moment when business came to an end; to brushing his back if it happened to become smeared with whitewash from a wall. Yet all this passed as unnoticed as though it had never been done. Finally, Chichikov sniffed into his superior's family and domestic life, and learnt that he possessed a grown-up daughter on whose face also there had taken place a nocturnal, diabolical grinding of peas. HERE was a quarter whence a fresh attack might be delivered! After ascertaining what church the daughter attended on Sundays, our hero took to contriving to meet her in a neat suit and a well-starched dickey: and soon the scheme began to work. The surly Chief Clerk wavered for a while; then ended by inviting Chichikov to tea. Nor could any man in the office have told you how it came about that before long Chichikov had removed to the Chief Clerk's house, and become a person necessary—indeed indispensable—to the household, seeing that he bought the flour and the sugar, treated the daughter as his betrothed, called the Chief Clerk “Papenka,” and occasionally kissed “Papenka's” hand. In fact, every one at the office supposed that, at the end of February (i.e. before the beginning of Lent) there would take place a wedding. Nay, the surly father even began to agitate with the authorities on Chichikov's behalf, and so enabled our hero, on a vacancy occurring, to attain the stool of a Chief Clerk. Apparently this marked the consummation of Chichikov's relations with his host, for he hastened stealthily to pack his trunk and, the next day, figured in a fresh lodging. Also, he ceased to call the Chief Clerk “Papenka,” or to kiss his hand; and the matter of the wedding came to as abrupt a termination as though it had never been mooted. Yet also he never failed to press his late host's hand, whenever he met him, and to invite him to tea; while, on the other hand, for all his immobility and dry indifference, the Chief Clerk never failed to shake his head with a muttered, “Ah, my fine fellow, you have grown too proud, you have grown too proud.”

The foregoing constituted the most difficult step that our hero had to negotiate. Thereafter things came with greater ease and swifter success. Everywhere he attracted notice, for he developed within himself everything necessary for this world—namely, charm of manner and bearing, and great diligence in business matters. Armed with these resources, he next obtained promotion to what is known as “a fat post,” and used it to the best advantage; and even though, at that period, strict inquiry had begun to be made into the whole subject of bribes, such inquiry failed to alarm him—nay, he actually turned it to account and thereby manifested the Russian resourcefulness which never fails to attain its zenith where extortion is concerned. His method of working was the following. As soon as a petitioner or a suitor put his hand into his pocket, to extract thence the necessary letters of recommendation for signature, Chichikov would smilingly exclaim as he detained his interlocutor's hand: “No, no! Surely you do not think that I—? But no, no! It is our duty, it is our obligation, and we do not require rewards for doing our work properly. So far as YOUR matter is concerned, you may rest easy. Everything shall be carried through to-morrow. But may I have your address? There is no need to trouble yourself, seeing that the documents can easily be brought to you at your residence.” Upon which the delighted suitor would return home in raptures, thinking: “Here, at long last, is the sort of man so badly needed. A man of that kind is a jewel beyond price.” Yet for a day, for two days—nay, even for three—the suitor would wait in vain so far as any messengers with documents were concerned. Then he would repair to the office—to find that his business had not so much as been entered upon! Lastly, he would confront the “jewel beyond price.” “Oh, pardon me, pardon me!” Chichikov would exclaim in the politest of tones as he seized and grasped the visitor's hands. “The truth is that we have SUCH a quantity of business on hand! But the matter shall be put through to-morrow, and in the meanwhile I am most sorry about it.” And with this would go the most fascinating of gestures. Yet neither on the morrow, nor on the day following, nor on the third would documents arrive at the suitor's abode. Upon that he would take thought as to whether something more ought not to have been done; and, sure enough, on his making inquiry, he would be informed that “something will have to be given to the copyists.” “Well, there can be no harm in that,” he would reply. “As a matter of fact, I have ready a tchetvertak or two.” “Oh, no, no,” the answer would come. “Not a tchetvertak per copyist, but a rouble, is the fee.” “What? A rouble per copyist?” “Certainly. What is there to grumble at in that? Of the money the copyists will receive a tchetvertak apiece, and the rest will go to the Government.” Upon that the disillusioned suitor would fly out upon the new order of things brought about by the inquiry into illicit fees, and curse both the tchinovniks and their uppish, insolent behaviour. “Once upon a time,” would the suitor lament, “one DID know what to do. Once one had tipped the Director a bank-note, one's affair was, so to speak, in the hat. But now one has to pay a rouble per copyist after waiting a week because otherwise it was impossible to guess how the wind might set! The devil fly away with all ‘disinterested’ and ‘trustworthy’ tchinovniks!” And certainly the aggrieved suitor had reason to grumble, seeing that, now that bribe-takers had ceased to exist, and Directors had uniformly become men of honour and integrity, secretaries and clerks ought not with impunity to have continued their thievish ways. In time there opened out to Chichikov a still wider field, for a Commission was appointed to supervise the erection of a Government building, and, on his being nominated to that body, he proved himself one of its most active members. The Commission got to work without delay, but for a space of six years had some trouble with the building in question. Either the climate hindered operations or the materials used were of the kind which prevents official edifices from ever rising higher than the basement. But, meanwhile, OTHER quarters of the town saw arise, for each member of the Commission, a handsome house of the NON-official style of architecture. Clearly the foundation afforded by the soil of those parts was better than that where the Government building was still engaged in hanging fire! Likewise the members of the Commission began to look exceedingly prosperous, and to blossom out into family life; and, for the first time in his existence, even Chichikov also departed from the iron laws of his self-imposed restraint and inexorable self-denial, and so far mitigated his heretofore asceticism as to show himself a man not averse to those amenities which, during his youth, he had been capable of renouncing. That is to say, certain superfluities began to make their appearance in his establishment. He engaged a good cook, took to wearing linen shirts, bought for himself cloth of a pattern worn by no one else in the province, figured in checks shot with the brightest of reds and browns, fitted himself out with two splendid horses (which he drove with a single pair of reins, added to a ring attachment for the trace horse), developed a habit of washing with a sponge dipped in eau-de-Cologne, and invested in soaps of the most expensive quality, in order to communicate to his skin a more elegant polish.

But suddenly there appeared upon the scene a new Director—a military man, and a martinet as regarded his hostility to bribe-takers and anything which might be called irregular. On the very day after his arrival he struck fear into every breast by calling for accounts, discovering hosts of deficits and missing sums, and directing his attention to the aforesaid fine houses of civilian architecture. Upon that there ensued a complete reshuffling. Tchinovniks were retired wholesale, and the houses were sequestrated to the Government, or else converted into various pious institutions and schools for soldiers' children. Thus the whole fabric, and especially Chichikov, came crashing to the ground. Particularly did our hero's agreeable face displease the new Director. Why that was so it is impossible to say, but frequently, in cases of the kind, no reason exists. However, the Director conceived a mortal dislike to him, and also extended that enmity to the whole of Chichikov's colleagues. But inasmuch as the said Director was a military man, he was not fully acquainted with the myriad subtleties of the civilian mind; wherefore it was not long before, by dint of maintaining a discreet exterior, added to a faculty for humouring all and sundry, a fresh gang of tchinovniks succeeded in restoring him to mildness, and the General found himself in the hands of greater thieves than before, but thieves whom he did not even suspect, seeing that he believed himself to have selected men fit and proper, and even ventured to boast of possessing a keen eye for talent. In a trice the tchinovniks concerned appraised his spirit and character; with the result that the entire sphere over which he ruled became an agency for the detection of irregularities. Everywhere, and in every case, were those irregularities pursued as a fisherman pursues a fat sturgeon with a gaff; and to such an extent did the sport prove successful that almost in no time each participator in the hunt was seen to be in possession of several thousand roubles of capital. Upon that a large number of the former band of tchinovniks also became converted to paths of rectitude, and were allowed to re-enter the Service; but not by hook or by crook could Chichikov worm his way back, even though, incited thereto by sundry items of paper currency, the General's first secretary and principal bear leader did all he could on our hero's behalf. It seemed that the General was the kind of man who, though easily led by the nose (provided it was done without his knowledge) no sooner got an idea into his head than it stuck there like a nail, and could not possibly be extracted; and all that the wily secretary succeeded in procuring was the tearing up of a certain dirty fragment of paper—even that being effected only by an appeal to the General's compassion, on the score of the unhappy fate which, otherwise, would befall Chichikov's wife and children (who, luckily, had no existence in fact).

“Well,” said Chichikov to himself, “I have done my best, and now everything has failed. Lamenting my misfortune won't help me, but only action.” And with that he decided to begin his career anew, and once more to arm himself with the weapons of patience and self-denial. The better to effect this, he had, of course to remove to another town. Yet somehow, for a while, things miscarried. More than once he found himself forced to exchange one post for another, and at the briefest of notice; and all of them were posts of the meanest, the most wretched, order. Yet, being a man of the utmost nicety of feeling, the fact that he found himself rubbing shoulders with anything but nice companions did not prevent him from preserving intact his innate love of what was decent and seemly, or from cherishing the instinct which led him to hanker after office fittings of lacquered wood, with neatness and orderliness everywhere. Nor did he at any time permit a foul word to creep into his speech, and would feel hurt even if in the speech of others there occurred a scornful reference to anything which pertained to rank and dignity. Also, the reader will be pleased to know that our hero changed his linen every other day, and in summer, when the weather was very hot, EVERY day, seeing that the very faintest suspicion of an unpleasant odour offended his fastidiousness. For the same reason it was his custom, before being valeted by Petrushka, always to plug his nostrils with a couple of cloves. In short, there were many occasions when his nerves suffered rackings as cruel as a young girl's, and so helped to increase his disgust at having once more to associate with men who set no store by the decencies of life. Yet, though he braced himself to the task, this period of adversity told upon his health, and he even grew a trifle shabby. More than once, on happening to catch sight of himself in the mirror, he could not forbear exclaiming: “Holy Mother of God, but what a nasty-looking brute I have become!” and for a long while afterwards could not with anything like sang-froid contemplate his reflection. Yet throughout he bore up stoutly and patiently—and ended by being transferred to the Customs Department. It may be said that the department had long constituted the secret goal of his ambition, for he had noted the foreign elegancies with which its officials always contrived to provide themselves, and had also observed that invariably they were able to send presents of china and cambric to their sisters and aunts—well, to their lady friends generally. Yes, more than once he had said to himself with a sigh: “THAT is the department to which I ought to belong, for, given a town near the frontier, and a sensible set of colleagues, I might be able to fit myself out with excellent linen shirts.” Also, it may be said that most frequently of all had his thoughts turned towards a certain quality of French soap which imparted a peculiar whiteness to the skin and a peerless freshness to the cheeks. Its name is known to God alone, but at least it was to be procured only in the immediate neighbourhood of the frontier. So, as I say, Chichikov had long felt a leaning towards the Customs, but for a time had been restrained from applying for the same by the various current advantages of the Building Commission; since rightly he had adjudged the latter to constitute a bird in the hand, and the former to constitute only a bird in the bush. But now he decided that, come what might, into the Customs he must make his way. And that way he made, and then applied himself to his new duties with a zeal born of the fact that he realised that fortune had specially marked him out for a Customs officer. Indeed, such activity, perspicuity, and ubiquity as his had never been seen or thought of. Within four weeks at the most he had so thoroughly got his hand in that he was conversant with Customs procedure in every detail. Not only could he weigh and measure, but also he could divine from an invoice how many arshins of cloth or other material a given piece contained, and then, taking a roll of the latter in his hand, could specify at once the number of pounds at which it would tip the scale. As for searchings, well, even his colleagues had to admit that he possessed the nose of a veritable bloodhound, and that it was impossible not to marvel at the patience wherewith he would try every button of the suspected person, yet preserve, throughout, a deadly politeness and an icy sang-froid which surpass belief. And while the searched were raging, and foaming at the mouth, and feeling that they would give worlds to alter his smiling exterior with a good, resounding slap, he would move not a muscle of his face, nor abate by a jot the urbanity of his demeanour, as he murmured, “Do you mind so far incommoding yourself as to stand up?” or “Pray step into the next room, madam, where the wife of one of our staff will attend you,” or “Pray allow me to slip this penknife of mine into the lining of your coat” (after which he would extract thence shawls and towels with as much nonchalance as he would have done from his own travelling-trunk). Even his superiors acknowledged him to be a devil at the job, rather than a human being, so perfect was his instinct for looking into cart-wheels, carriage-poles, horses' ears, and places whither an author ought not to penetrate even in thought—places whither only a Customs official is permitted to go. The result was that the wretched traveller who had just crossed the frontier would, within a few minutes, become wholly at sea, and, wiping away the perspiration, and breaking out into body flushes, would be reduced to crossing himself and muttering, “Well, well, well!” In fact, such a traveller would feel in the position of a schoolboy who, having been summoned to the presence of the headmaster for the ostensible purpose of being give an order, has found that he receives, instead, a sound flogging. In short, for some time Chichikov made it impossible for smugglers to earn a living. In particular, he reduced Polish Jewry almost to despair, so invincible, so almost unnatural, was the rectitude, the incorruptibility which led him to refrain from converting himself into a small capitalist with the aid of confiscated goods and articles which, “to save excessive clerical labour,” had failed to be handed over to the Government. Also, without saying it goes that such phenomenally zealous and disinterested service attracted general astonishment, and, eventually, the notice of the authorities; whereupon he received promotion, and followed that up by mooting a scheme for the infallible detection of contrabandists, provided that he could be furnished with the necessary authority for carrying out the same. At once such authority was accorded him, as also unlimited power to conduct every species of search and investigation. And that was all he wanted. It happened that previously there had been formed a well-found association for smuggling on regular, carefully prepared lines, and that this daring scheme seemed to promise profit to the extent of some millions of money: yet, though he had long had knowledge of it, Chichikov had said to the association's emissaries, when sent to buy him over, “The time is not yet.” But now that he had got all the reins into his hands, he sent word of the fact to the gang, and with it the remark, “The time is NOW.” Nor was he wrong in his calculations, for, within the space of a year, he had acquired what he could not have made during twenty years of non-fraudulent service. With similar sagacity he had, during his early days in the department, declined altogether to enter into relations with the association, for the reason that he had then been a mere cipher, and would have come in for nothing large in the way of takings; but now—well, now it was another matter altogether, and he could dictate what terms he liked. Moreover, that the affair might progress the more smoothly, he suborned a fellow tchinovnik of the type which, in spite of grey hairs, stands powerless against temptation; and, the contract concluded, the association duly proceeded to business. Certainly business began brilliantly. But probably most of my readers are familiar with the oft-repeated story of the passage of Spanish sheep across the frontier in double fleeces which carried between their outer layers and their inner enough lace of Brabant to sell to the tune of millions of roubles; wherefore I will not recount the story again beyond saying that those journeys took place just when Chichikov had become head of the Customs, and that, had he not a hand in the enterprise, not all the Jews in the world could have brought it to success. By the time that three or four of these ovine invasions had taken place, Chichikov and his accomplice had come to be the possessors of four hundred thousand roubles apiece; while some even aver that the former's gains totalled half a million, owing to the greater industry which he had displayed in the matter. Nor can any one but God say to what a figure the fortunes of the pair might not eventually have attained, had not an awkward contretemps cut right across their arrangements. That is to say, for some reason or another the devil so far deprived these tchinovnik-conspirators of sense as to make them come to words with one another, and then to engage in a quarrel. Beginning with a heated argument, this quarrel reached the point of Chichikov—who was, possibly, a trifle tipsy—calling his colleague a priest's son; and though that description of the person so addressed was perfectly accurate, he chose to take offence, and to answer Chichikov with the words (loudly and incisively uttered), “It is YOU who have a priest for your father,” and to add to that (the more to incense his companion), “Yes, mark you! THAT is how it is.” Yet, though he had thus turned the tables upon Chichikov with a tu quoque, and then capped that exploit with the words last quoted, the offended tchinovnik could not remain satisfied, but went on to send in an anonymous document to the authorities. On the other hand, some aver that it was over a woman that the pair fell out—over a woman who, to quote the phrase then current among the staff of the Customs Department, was “as fresh and as strong as the pulp of a turnip,” and that night-birds were hired to assault our hero in a dark alley, and that the scheme miscarried, and that in any case both Chichikov and his friend had been deceived, seeing that the person to whom the lady had really accorded her favours was a certain staff-captain named Shamsharev. However, only God knows the truth of the matter. Let the inquisitive reader ferret it out for himself. The fact remains that a complete exposure of the dealings with the contrabandists followed, and that the two tchinovniks were put to the question, deprived of their property, and made to formulate in writing all that they had done. Against this thunderbolt of fortune the State Councillor could make no headway, and in some retired spot or another sank into oblivion; but Chichikov put a brave face upon the matter, for, in spite of the authorities' best efforts to smell out his gains, he had contrived to conceal a portion of them, and also resorted to every subtle trick of intellect which could possibly be employed by an experienced man of the world who has a wide knowledge of his fellows. Nothing which could be effected by pleasantness of demeanour, by moving oratory, by clouds of flattery, and by the occasional insertion of a coin into a palm did he leave undone; with the result that he was retired with less ignominy than was his companion, and escaped actual trial on a criminal charge. Yet he issued stripped of all his capital, stripped of his imported effects, stripped of everything. That is to say, all that remained to him consisted of ten thousand roubles which he had stored against a rainy day, two dozen linen shirts, a small britchka of the type used by bachelors, and two serving-men named Selifan and Petrushka. Yes, and an impulse of kindness moved the tchinovniks of the Customs also to set aside for him a few cakes of the soap which he had found so excellent for the freshness of the cheeks. Thus once more our hero found himself stranded. And what an accumulation of misfortunes had descended upon his head!— though, true, he termed them “suffering in the Service in the cause of Truth.” Certainly one would have thought that, after these buffetings and trials and changes of fortune—after this taste of the sorrows of life—he and his precious ten thousand roubles would have withdrawn to some peaceful corner in a provincial town, where, clad in a stuff dressing-gown, he could have sat and listened to the peasants quarrelling on festival days, or (for the sake of a breath of fresh air) have gone in person to the poulterer's to finger chickens for soup, and so have spent a quiet, but not wholly useless, existence; but nothing of the kind took place, and therein we must do justice to the strength of his character. In other words, although he had undergone what, to the majority of men, would have meant ruin and discouragement and a shattering of ideals, he still preserved his energy. True, downcast and angry, and full of resentment against the world in general, he felt furious with the injustice of fate, and dissatisfied with the dealings of men; yet he could not forbear courting additional experiences. In short, the patience which he displayed was such as to make the wooden persistency of the German—a persistency merely due to the slow, lethargic circulation of the Teuton's blood—seem nothing at all, seeing that by nature Chichikov's blood flowed strongly, and that he had to employ much force of will to curb within himself those elements which longed to burst forth and revel in freedom. He thought things over, and, as he did so, a certain spice of reason appeared in his reflections.

“How have I come to be what I am?” he said to himself. “Why has misfortune overtaken me in this way? Never have I wronged a poor person, or robbed a widow, or turned any one out of doors: I have always been careful only to take advantage of those who possess more than their share. Moreover, I have never gleaned anywhere but where every one else was gleaning; and, had I not done so, others would have gleaned in my place. Why, then, should those others be prospering, and I be sunk as low as a worm? What am I? What am I good for? How can I, in future, hope to look any honest father of a family in the face? How shall I escape being tortured with the thought that I am cumbering the ground? What, in the years to come, will my children say, save that ‘our father was a brute, for he left us nothing to live upon?’”

Here I may remark that we have seen how much thought Chichikov devoted to his future descendants. Indeed, had not there been constantly recurring to his mind the insistent question, “What will my children say?” he might not have plunged into the affair so deeply. Nevertheless, like a wary cat which glances hither and thither to see whether its mistress be not coming before it can make off with whatsoever first falls to its paw (butter, fat, lard, a duck, or anything else), so our future founder of a family continued, though weeping and bewailing his lot, to let not a single detail escape his eye. That is to say, he retained his wits ever in a state of activity, and kept his brain constantly working. All that he required was a plan. Once more he pulled himself together, once more he embarked upon a life of toil, once more he stinted himself in everything, once more he left clean and decent surroundings for a dirty, mean existence. In other words, until something better should turn up, he embraced the calling of an ordinary attorney—a calling which, not then possessed of a civic status, was jostled on very side, enjoyed little respect at the hands of the minor legal fry (or, indeed, at its own), and perforce met with universal slights and rudeness. But sheer necessity compelled Chichikov to face these things. Among commissions entrusted to him was that of placing in the hands of the Public Trustee several hundred peasants who belonged to a ruined estate. The estate had reached its parlous condition through cattle disease, through rascally bailiffs, through failures of the harvest, through such epidemic diseases that had killed off the best workmen, and, last, but not least, through the senseless conduct of the owner himself, who had furnished a house in Moscow in the latest style, and then squandered his every kopeck, so that nothing was left for his further maintenance, and it became necessary to mortgage the remains—including the peasants—of the estate. In those days mortgage to the Treasury was an innovation looked upon with reserve, and, as attorney in the matter, Chichikov had first of all to “entertain” every official concerned (we know that, unless that be previously done, unless a whole bottle of madeira first be emptied down each clerical throat, not the smallest legal affair can be carried through), and to explain, for the barring of future attachments, that half of the peasants were dead.

“And are they entered on the revision lists?” asked the secretary. “Yes,” replied Chichikov. “Then what are you boggling at?” continued the Secretary. “Should one soul die, another will be born, and in time grow up to take the first one's place.” Upon that there dawned on our hero one of the most inspired ideas which ever entered the human brain. “What a simpleton I am!” he thought to himself. “Here am I looking about for my mittens when all the time I have got them tucked into my belt. Why, were I myself to buy up a few souls which are dead—to buy them before a new revision list shall have been made, the Council of Public Trust might pay me two hundred roubles apiece for them, and I might find myself with, say, a capital of two hundred thousand roubles! The present moment is particularly propitious, since in various parts of the country there has been an epidemic, and, glory be to God, a large number of souls have died of it. Nowadays landowners have taken to card-playing and junketting and wasting their money, or to joining the Civil Service in St. Petersburg; consequently their estates are going to rack and ruin, and being managed in any sort of fashion, and succeeding in paying their dues with greater difficulty each year. That being so, not a man of the lot but would gladly surrender to me his dead souls rather than continue paying the poll-tax; and in this fashion I might make—well, not a few kopecks. Of course there are difficulties, and, to avoid creating a scandal, I should need to employ plenty of finesse; but man was given his brain to USE, not to neglect. One good point about the scheme is that it will seem so improbable that in case of an accident, no one in the world will believe in it. True, it is illegal to buy or mortgage peasants without land, but I can easily pretend to be buying them only for transferment elsewhere. Land is to be acquired in the provinces of Taurida and Kherson almost for nothing, provided that one undertakes subsequently to colonise it; so to Kherson I will ‘transfer’ them, and long may they live there! And the removal of my dead souls shall be carried out in the strictest legal form; and if the authorities should want confirmation by testimony, I shall produce a letter signed by my own superintendent of the Khersonian rural police—that is to say, by myself. Lastly, the supposed village in Kherson shall be called Chichikovöe—better still Pavlovsköe, according to my Christian name.”

In this fashion there germinated in our hero's brain that strange scheme for which the reader may or may not be grateful, but for which the author certainly is so, seeing that, had it never occurred to Chichikov, this story would never have seen the light.

After crossing himself, according to the Russian custom, Chichikov set about carrying out his enterprise. On pretence of selecting a place wherein to settle, he started forth to inspect various corners of the Russian Empire, but more especially those which had suffered from such unfortunate accidents as failures of the harvest, a high rate of mortality, or whatsoever else might enable him to purchase souls at the lowest possible rate. But he did not tackle his landowners haphazard: he rather selected such of them as seemed more particularly suited to his taste, or with whom he might with the least possible trouble conclude identical agreements; though, in the first instance, he always tried, by getting on terms of acquaintanceship—better still, of friendship— with them, to acquire the souls for nothing, and so to avoid purchase at all. In passing, my readers must not blame me if the characters whom they have encountered in these pages have not been altogether to their liking. The fault is Chichikov's rather than mine, for he is the master, and where he leads we must follow. Also, should my readers gird at me for a certain dimness and want of clarity in my principal characters and actors, that will be tantamount to saying that never do the broad tendency and the general scope of a work become immediately apparent. Similarly does the entry to every town—the entry even to the Capital itself—convey to the traveller such an impression of vagueness that at first everything looks grey and monotonous, and the lines of smoky factories and workshops seem never to be coming to an end; but in time there will begin also to stand out the outlines of six-storied mansions, and of shops and balconies, and wide perspectives of streets, and a medley of steeples, columns, statues, and turrets—the whole framed in rattle and roar and the infinite wonders which the hand and the brain of men have conceived. Of the manner in which Chichikov's first purchases were made the reader is aware. Subsequently he will see also how the affair progressed, and with what success or failure our hero met, and how Chichikov was called upon to decide and to overcome even more difficult problems than the foregoing, and by what colossal forces the levers of his far-flung tale are moved, and how eventually the horizon will become extended until everything assumes a grandiose and a lyrical tendency. Yes, many a verst of road remains to be travelled by a party made up of an elderly gentleman, a britchka of the kind affected by bachelors, a valet named Petrushka, a coachman named Selifan, and three horses which, from the Assessor to the skewbald, are known to us individually by name. Again, although I have given a full description of our hero's exterior (such as it is), I may yet be asked for an inclusive definition also of his moral personality. That he is no hero compounded of virtues and perfections must be already clear. Then WHAT is he? A villain? Why should we call him a villain? Why should we be so hard upon a fellow man? In these days our villains have ceased to exist. Rather it would be fairer to call him an ACQUIRER. The love of acquisition, the love of gain, is a fault common to many, and gives rise to many and many a transaction of the kind generally known as “not strictly honourable.” True, such a character contains an element of ugliness, and the same reader who, on his journey through life, would sit at the board of a character of this kind, and spend a most agreeable time with him, would be the first to look at him askance if he should appear in the guise of the hero of a novel or a play. But wise is the reader who, on meeting such a character, scans him carefully, and, instead of shrinking from him with distaste, probes him to the springs of his being. The human personality contains nothing which may not, in the twinkling of an eye, become altogether changed—nothing in which, before you can look round, there may not spring to birth some cankerous worm which is destined to suck thence the essential juice. Yes, it is a common thing to see not only an overmastering passion, but also a passion of the most petty order, arise in a man who was born to better things, and lead him both to forget his greatest and most sacred obligations, and to see only in the veriest trifles the Great and the Holy. For human passions are as numberless as is the sand of the seashore, and go on to become his most insistent of masters. Happy, therefore, the man who may choose from among the gamut of human passions one which is noble! Hour by hour will that instinct grow and multiply in its measureless beneficence; hour by hour will it sink deeper and deeper into the infinite paradise of his soul. But there are passions of which a man cannot rid himself, seeing that they are born with him at his birth, and he has no power to abjure them. Higher powers govern those passions, and in them is something which will call to him, and refuse to be silenced, to the end of his life. Yes, whether in a guise of darkness, or whether in a guise which will become converted into a light to lighten the world, they will and must attain their consummation on life's field: and in either case they have been evoked for man's good. In the same way may the passion which drew our Chichikov onwards have been one that was independent of himself; in the same way may there have lurked even in his cold essence something which will one day cause men to humble themselves in the dust before the infinite wisdom of God.

Yet that folk should be dissatisfied with my hero matters nothing. What matters is the fact that, under different circumstances, their approval could have been taken as a foregone conclusion. That is to say, had not the author pried over-deeply into Chichikov's soul, nor stirred up in its depths what shunned and lay hidden from the light, nor disclosed those of his hero's thoughts which that hero would have not have disclosed even to his most intimate friend; had the author, indeed, exhibited Chichikov just as he exhibited himself to the townsmen of N. and Manilov and the rest; well, then we may rest assured that every reader would have been delighted with him, and have voted him a most interesting person. For it is not nearly so necessary that Chichikov should figure before the reader as though his form and person were actually present to the eye as that, on concluding a perusal of this work, the reader should be able to return, unharrowed in soul, to that cult of the card-table which is the solace and delight of all good Russians. Yes, readers of this book, none of you really care to see humanity revealed in its nakedness. “Why should we do so?” you say. “What would be the use of it? Do we not know for ourselves that human life contains much that is gross and contemptible? Do we not with our own eyes have to look upon much that is anything but comforting? Far better would it be if you would put before us what is comely and attractive, so that we might forget ourselves a little.” In the same fashion does a landowner say to his bailiff: “Why do you come and tell me that the affairs of my estate are in a bad way? I know that without YOUR help. Have you nothing else to tell me? Kindly allow me to forget the fact, or else to remain in ignorance of it, and I shall be much obliged to you.” Whereafter the said landowner probably proceeds to spend on his diversion the money which ought to have gone towards the rehabilitation of his affairs.

Possibly the author may also incur censure at the hands of those so-called “patriots” who sit quietly in corners, and become capitalists through making fortunes at the expense of others. Yes, let but something which they conceive to be derogatory to their country occur—for instance, let there be published some book which voices the bitter truth—and out they will come from their hiding-places like a spider which perceives a fly to be caught in its web. “Is it well to proclaim this to the world, and to set folk talking about it?” they will cry. “What you have described touches US, is OUR affair. Is conduct of that kind right? What will foreigners say? Does any one care calmly to sit by and hear himself traduced? Why should you lead foreigners to suppose that all is not well with us, and that we are not patriotic?” Well, to these sage remarks no answer can really be returned, especially to such of the above as refer to foreign opinion. But see here. There once lived in a remote corner of Russia two natives of the region indicated. One of those natives was a good man named Kifa Mokievitch, and a man of kindly disposition; a man who went through life in a dressing-gown, and paid no heed to his household, for the reason that his whole being was centred upon the province of speculation, and that, in particular, he was preoccupied with a philosophical problem usually stated by him thus: “A beast,” he would say, “is born naked. Now, why should that be? Why should not a beast be born as a bird is born—that is to say, through the process of being hatched from an egg? Nature is beyond the understanding, however much one may probe her.” This was the substance of Kifa Mokievitch's reflections. But herein is not the chief point. The other of the pair was a fellow named Mofi Kifovitch, and son to the first named. He was what we Russians call a “hero,” and while his father was pondering the parturition of beasts, his, the son's, lusty, twentyyear-old temperament was violently struggling for development. Yet that son could tackle nothing without some accident occurring. At one moment would he crack some one's fingers in half, and at another would he raise a bump on somebody's nose; so that both at home and abroad every one and everything—from the serving-maid to the yard-dog—fled on his approach, and even the bed in his bedroom became shattered to splinters. Such was Mofi Kifovitch; and with it all he had a kindly soul. But herein is not the chief point. “Good sir, good Kifa Mokievitch,” servants and neighbours would come and say to the father, “what are you going to do about your Moki Kifovitch? We get no rest from him, he is so above himself.” “That is only his play, that is only his play,” the father would reply. “What else can you expect? It is too late now to start a quarrel with him, and, moreover, every one would accuse me of harshness. True, he is a little conceited; but, were I to reprove him in public, the whole thing would become common talk, and folk would begin giving him a dog's name. And if they did that, would not their opinion touch me also, seeing that I am his father? Also, I am busy with philosophy, and have no time for such things. Lastly, Moki Kifovitch is my son, and very dear to my heart.” And, beating his breast, Kifa Mokievitch again asserted that, even though his son should elect to continue his pranks, it would not be for HIM, for the father, to proclaim the fact, or to fall out with his offspring. And, this expression of paternal feeling uttered, Kifa Mokievitch left Moki Kifovitch to his heroic exploits, and himself returned to his beloved subject of speculation, which now included also the problem, “Suppose elephants were to take to being hatched from eggs, would not the shell of such eggs be of a thickness proof against cannonballs, and necessitate the invention of some new type of firearm?” Thus at the end of this little story we have these two denizens of a peaceful corner of Russia looking thence, as from a window, in less terror of doing what was scandalous than of having it SAID of them that they were acting scandalously. Yes, the feeling animating our so-called “patriots” is not true patriotism at all. Something else lies beneath it. Who, if not an author, is to speak aloud the truth? Men like you, my pseudo-patriots, stand in dread of the eye which is able to discern, yet shrink from using your own, and prefer, rather, to glance at everything unheedingly. Yes, after laughing heartily over Chichikov's misadventures, and perhaps even commending the author for his dexterity of observation and pretty turn of wit, you will look at yourselves with redoubled pride and a self-satisfied smile, and add: “Well, we agree that in certain parts of the provinces there exists strange and ridiculous individuals, as well as unconscionable rascals.”

Yet which of you, when quiet, and alone, and engaged in solitary self-communion, would not do well to probe YOUR OWN souls, and to put to YOURSELVES the solemn question, “Is there not in ME an element of Chichikov?” For how should there not be? Which of you is not liable at any moment to be passed in the street by an acquaintance who, nudging his neighbour, may say of you, with a barely suppressed sneer: “Look! there goes Chichikov! That is Chichikov who has just gone by!”

But here are we talking at the top of our voices whilst all the time our hero lies slumbering in his britchka! Indeed, his name has been repeated so often during the recital of his life's history that he must almost have heard us! And at any time he is an irritable, irascible fellow when spoken of with disrespect. True, to the reader Chichikov's displeasure cannot matter a jot; but for the author it would mean ruin to quarrel with his hero, seeing that, arm in arm, Chichikov and he have yet far to go.

“Tut, tut, tut!” came in a shout from Chichikov. “Hi, Selifan!”

“What is it?” came the reply, uttered with a drawl.

“What is it? Why, how dare you drive like that? Come! Bestir yourself a little!”

And indeed, Selifan had long been sitting with half-closed eyes, and hands which bestowed no encouragement upon his somnolent steeds save an occasional flicking of the reins against their flanks; whilst Petrushka had lost his cap, and was leaning backwards until his head had come to rest against Chichikov's knees—a position which necessitated his being awakened with a cuff. Selifan also roused himself, and apportioned to the skewbald a few cuts across the back of a kind which at least had the effect of inciting that animal to trot; and when, presently, the other two horses followed their companion's example, the light britchka moved forwards like a piece of thistledown. Selifan flourished his whip and shouted, “Hi, hi!” as the inequalities of the road jerked him vertically on his seat; and meanwhile, reclining against the leather cushions of the vehicle's interior, Chichikov smiled with gratification at the sensation of driving fast. For what Russian does not love to drive fast? Which of us does not at times yearn to give his horses their head, and to let them go, and to cry, “To the devil with the world!”? At such moments a great force seems to uplift one as on wings; and one flies, and everything else flies, but contrariwise—both the verst stones, and traders riding on the shafts of their waggons, and the forest with dark lines of spruce and fir amid which may be heard the axe of the woodcutter and the croaking of the raven. Yes, out of a dim, remote distance the road comes towards one, and while nothing save the sky and the light clouds through which the moon is cleaving her way seem halted, the brief glimpses wherein one can discern nothing clearly have in them a pervading touch of mystery. Ah, troika, troika, swift as a bird, who was it first invented you? Only among a hardy race of folk can you have come to birth—only in a land which, though poor and rough, lies spread over half the world, and spans versts the counting whereof would leave one with aching eyes. Nor are you a modishly-fashioned vehicle of the road—a thing of clamps and iron. Rather, you are a vehicle but shapen and fitted with the axe or chisel of some handy peasant of Yaroslav. Nor are you driven by a coachman clothed in German livery, but by a man bearded and mittened. See him as he mounts, and flourishes his whip, and breaks into a long-drawn song! Away like the wind go the horses, and the wheels, with their spokes, become transparent circles, and the road seems to quiver beneath them, and a pedestrian, with a cry of astonishment, halts to watch the vehicle as it flies, flies, flies on its way until it becomes lost on the ultimate horizon—a speck amid a cloud of dust!

And you, Russia of mine—are not you also speeding like a troika which nought can overtake? Is not the road smoking beneath your wheels, and the bridges thundering as you cross them, and everything being left in the rear, and the spectators, struck with the portent, halting to wonder whether you be not a thunderbolt launched from heaven? What does that awe-inspiring progress of yours foretell? What is the unknown force which lies within your mysterious steeds? Surely the winds themselves must abide in their manes, and every vein in their bodies be an ear stretched to catch the celestial message which bids them, with iron-girded breasts, and hooves which barely touch the earth as they gallop, fly forward on a mission of God? Whither, then, are you speeding, O Russia of mine? Whither? Answer me! But no answer comes—only the weird sound of your collar-bells. Rent into a thousand shreds, the air roars past you, for you are overtaking the whole world, and shall one day force all nations, all empires to stand aside, to give you way!





AUTHOR'S PREFACE TO THE FIRST PORTION OF THIS WORK


Second Edition published in 1846 From the Author to the Reader


Reader, whosoever or wheresoever you be, and whatsoever be your station—whether that of a member of the higher ranks of society or that of a member of the plainer walks of life—I beg of you, if God shall have given you any skill in letters, and my book shall fall into your hands, to extend to me your assistance.

For in the book which lies before you, and which, probably, you have read in its first edition, there is portrayed a man who is a type taken from our Russian Empire. This man travels about the Russian land and meets with folk of every condition—from the nobly-born to the humble toiler. Him I have taken as a type to show forth the vices and the failings, rather than the merits and the virtues, of the commonplace Russian individual; and the characters which revolve around him have also been selected for the purpose of demonstrating our national weaknesses and shortcomings. As for men and women of the better sort, I propose to portray them in subsequent volumes. Probably much of what I have described is improbable and does not happen as things customarily happen in Russia; and the reason for that is that for me to learn all that I have wished to do has been impossible, in that human life is not sufficiently long to become acquainted with even a hundredth part of what takes place within the borders of the Russian Empire. Also, carelessness, inexperience, and lack of time have led to my perpetrating numerous errors and inaccuracies of detail; with the result that in every line of the book there is something which calls for correction. For these reasons I beg of you, my reader, to act also as my corrector. Do not despise the task, for, however superior be your education, and however lofty your station, and however insignificant, in your eyes, my book, and however trifling the apparent labour of correcting and commenting upon that book, I implore you to do as I have said. And you too, O reader of lowly education and simple status, I beseech you not to look upon yourself as too ignorant to be able in some fashion, however small, to help me. Every man who has lived in the world and mixed with his fellow men will have remarked something which has remained hidden from the eyes of others; and therefore I beg of you not to deprive me of your comments, seeing that it cannot be that, should you read my book with attention, you will have NOTHING to say at some point therein.

For example, how excellent it would be if some reader who is sufficiently rich in experience and the knowledge of life to be acquainted with the sort of characters which I have described herein would annotate in detail the book, without missing a single page, and undertake to read it precisely as though, laying pen and paper before him, he were first to peruse a few pages of the work, and then to recall his own life, and the lives of folk with whom he has come in contact, and everything which he has seen with his own eyes or has heard of from others, and to proceed to annotate, in so far as may tally with his own experience or otherwise, what is set forth in the book, and to jot down the whole exactly as it stands pictured to his memory, and, lastly, to send me the jottings as they may issue from his pen, and to continue doing so until he has covered the entire work! Yes, he would indeed do me a vital service! Of style or beauty of expression he would need to take no account, for the value of a book lies in its truth and its actuality rather than in its wording. Nor would he need to consider my feelings if at any point he should feel minded to blame or to upbraid me, or to demonstrate the harm rather than the good which has been done through any lack of thought or verisimilitude of which I have been guilty. In short, for anything and for everything in the way of criticism I should be thankful.

Also, it would be an excellent thing if some reader in the higher walks of life, some person who stands remote, both by life and by education, from the circle of folk which I have pictured in my book, but who knows the life of the circle in which he himself revolves, would undertake to read my work in similar fashion, and methodically to recall to his mind any members of superior social classes whom he has met, and carefully to observe whether there exists any resemblance between one such class and another, and whether, at times, there may not be repeated in a higher sphere what is done in a lower, and likewise to note any additional fact in the same connection which may occur to him (that is to say, any fact pertaining to the higher ranks of society which would seem to confirm or to disprove his conclusions), and, lastly, to record that fact as it may have occurred within his own experience, while giving full details of persons (of individual manners, tendencies, and customs) and also of inanimate surroundings (of dress, furniture, fittings of houses, and so forth). For I need knowledge of the classes in question, which are the flower of our people. In fact, this very reason—the reason that I do not yet know Russian life in all its aspects, and in the degree to which it is necessary for me to know it in order to become a successful author—is what has, until now, prevented me from publishing any subsequent volumes of this story.

Again, it would be an excellent thing if some one who is endowed with the faculty of imagining and vividly picturing to himself the various situations wherein a character may be placed, and of mentally following up a character's career in one field and another—by this I mean some one who possesses the power of entering into and developing the ideas of the author whose work he may be reading—would scan each character herein portrayed, and tell me how each character ought to have acted at a given juncture, and what, to judge from the beginnings of each character, ought to have become of that character later, and what new circumstances might be devised in connection therewith, and what new details might advantageously be added to those already described. Honestly can I say that to consider these points against the time when a new edition of my book may be published in a different and a better form would give me the greatest possible pleasure.

One thing in particular would I ask of any reader who may be willing to give me the benefit of his advice. That is to say, I would beg of him to suppose, while recording his remarks, that it is for the benefit of a man in no way his equal in education, or similar to him in tastes and ideas, or capable of apprehending criticisms without full explanation appended, that he is doing so. Rather would I ask such a reader to suppose that before him there stands a man of incomparably inferior enlightenment and schooling—a rude country bumpkin whose life, throughout, has been passed in retirement—a bumpkin to whom it is necessary to explain each circumstance in detail, while never forgetting to be as simple of speech as though he were a child, and at every step there were a danger of employing terms beyond his understanding. Should these precautions be kept constantly in view by any reader undertaking to annotate my book, that reader's remarks will exceed in weight and interest even his own expectations, and will bring me very real advantage.

Thus, provided that my earnest request be heeded by my readers, and that among them there be found a few kind spirits to do as I desire, the following is the manner in which I would request them to transmit their notes for my consideration. Inscribing the package with my name, let them then enclose that package in a second one addressed either to the Rector of the University of St. Petersburg or to Professor Shevirev of the University of Moscow, according as the one or the other of those two cities may be the nearer to the sender.

Lastly, while thanking all journalists and litterateurs for their previously published criticisms of my book—criticisms which, in spite of a spice of that intemperance and prejudice which is common to all humanity, have proved of the greatest use both to my head and to my heart—I beg of such writers again to favour me with their reviews. For in all sincerity I can assure them that whatsoever they may be pleased to say for my improvement and my instruction will be received by me with naught but gratitude.





PART II





CHAPTER I


Why do I so persistently paint the poverty, the imperfections of Russian life, and delve into the remotest depths, the most retired holes and corners, of our Empire for my subjects? The answer is that there is nothing else to be done when an author's idiosyncrasy happens to incline him that way. So again we find ourselves in a retired spot. But what a spot!

Imagine, if you can, a mountain range like a gigantic fortress, with embrasures and bastions which appear to soar a thousand versts towards the heights of heaven, and, towering grandly over a boundless expanse of plain, are broken up into precipitous, overhanging limestone cliffs. Here and there those cliffs are seamed with water-courses and gullies, while at other points they are rounded off into spurs of green—spurs now coated with fleece-like tufts of young undergrowth, now studded with the stumps of felled trees, now covered with timber which has, by some miracle, escaped the woodman's axe. Also, a river winds awhile between its banks, then leaves the meadow land, divides into runlets (all flashing in the sun like fire), plunges, re-united, into the midst of a thicket of elder, birth, and pine, and, lastly, speeds triumphantly past bridges and mills and weirs which seem to be lying in wait for it at every turn.

At one particular spot the steep flank of the mountain range is covered with billowy verdure of denser growth than the rest; and here the aid of skilful planting, added to the shelter afforded by a rugged ravine, has enabled the flora of north and south so to be brought together that, twined about with sinuous hop-tendrils, the oak, the spruce fir, the wild pear, the maple, the cherry, the thorn, and the mountain ash either assist or check one another's growth, and everywhere cover the declivity with their straggling profusion. Also, at the edge of the summit there can be seen mingling with the green of the trees the red roofs of a manorial homestead, while behind the upper stories of the mansion proper and its carved balcony and a great semi-circular window there gleam the tiles and gables of some peasants' huts. Lastly, over this combination of trees and roofs there rises—overtopping everything with its gilded, sparkling steeple—an old village church. On each of its pinnacles a cross of carved gilt is stayed with supports of similar gilding and design; with the result that from a distance the gilded portions have the effect of hanging without visible agency in the air. And the whole—the three successive tiers of woodland, roofs, and crosses whole—lies exquisitely mirrored in the river below, where hollow willows, grotesquely shaped (some of them rooted on the river's banks, and some in the water itself, and all drooping their branches until their leaves have formed a tangle with the water lilies which float on the surface), seem to be gazing at the marvellous reflection at their feet.

Thus the view from below is beautiful indeed. But the view from above is even better. No guest, no visitor, could stand on the balcony of the mansion and remain indifferent. So boundless is the panorama revealed that surprise would cause him to catch at his breath, and exclaim: “Lord of Heaven, but what a prospect!” Beyond meadows studded with spinneys and water-mills lie forests belted with green; while beyond, again, there can be seen showing through the slightly misty air strips of yellow heath, and, again, wide-rolling forests (as blue as the sea or a cloud), and more heath, paler than the first, but still yellow. Finally, on the far horizon a range of chalk-topped hills gleams white, even in dull weather, as though it were lightened with perpetual sunshine; and here and there on the dazzling whiteness of its lower slopes some plaster-like, nebulous patches represent far-off villages which lie too remote for the eye to discern their details. Indeed, only when the sunlight touches a steeple to gold does one realise that each such patch is a human settlement. Finally, all is wrapped in an immensity of silence which even the far, faint echoes of persons singing in the void of the plain cannot shatter.

Even after gazing at the spectacle for a couple of hours or so, the visitor would still find nothing to say, save: “Lord of Heaven, but what a prospect!” Then who is the dweller in, the proprietor of, this manor—a manor to which, as to an impregnable fortress, entrance cannot be gained from the side where we have been standing, but only from the other approach, where a few scattered oaks offer hospitable welcome to the visitor, and then, spreading above him their spacious branches (as in friendly embrace), accompany him to the facade of the mansion whose top we have been regarding from the reverse aspect, but which now stands frontwise on to us, and has, on one side of it, a row of peasants' huts with red tiles and carved gables, and, on the other, the village church, with those glittering golden crosses and gilded open-work charms which seem to hang suspended in the air? Yes, indeed!— to what fortunate individual does this corner of the world belong? It belongs to Andrei Ivanovitch Tientietnikov, landowner of the canton of Tremalakhan, and, withal, a bachelor of about thirty.

Should my lady readers ask of me what manner of man is Tientietnikov, and what are his attributes and peculiarities, I should refer them to his neighbours. Of these, a member of the almost extinct tribe of intelligent staff officers on the retired list once summed up Tientietnikov in the phrase, “He is an absolute blockhead;” while a General who resided ten versts away was heard to remark that “he is a young man who, though not exactly a fool, has at least too much crowded into his head. I myself might have been of use to him, for not only do I maintain certain connections with St. Petersburg, but also—” And the General left his sentence unfinished. Thirdly, a captain-superintendent of rural police happened to remark in the course of conversation: “To-morrow I must go and see Tientietnikov about his arrears.” Lastly, a peasant of Tientietnikov's own village, when asked what his barin was like, returned no answer at all. All of which would appear to show that Tientietnikov was not exactly looked upon with favour.

To speak dispassionately, however, he was not a bad sort of fellow— merely a star-gazer; and since the world contains many watchers of the skies, why should Tientietnikov not have been one of them? However, let me describe in detail a specimen day of his existence—one that will closely resemble the rest, and then the reader will be enabled to judge of Tientietnikov's character, and how far his life corresponded to the beauties of nature with which he lived surrounded.

On the morning of the specimen day in question he awoke very late, and, raising himself to a sitting posture, rubbed his eyes. And since those eyes were small, the process of rubbing them occupied a very long time, and throughout its continuance there stood waiting by the door his valet, Mikhailo, armed with a towel and basin. For one hour, for two hours, did poor Mikhailo stand there: then he departed to the kitchen, and returned to find his master still rubbing his eyes as he sat on the bed. At length, however, Tientietnikov rose, washed himself, donned a dressing-gown, and moved into the drawing-room for morning tea, coffee, cocoa, and warm milk; of all of which he partook but sparingly, while munching a piece of bread, and scattering tobacco ash with complete insouciance. Two hours did he sit over this meal, then poured himself out another cup of the rapidly cooling tea, and walked to the window. This faced the courtyard, and outside it, as usual, there took place the following daily altercation between a serf named Grigory (who purported to act as butler) and the housekeeper, Perfilievna.

Grigory. Ah, you nuisance, you good-for-nothing, you had better hold your stupid tongue.

Perfilievna. Yes; and don't you wish that I would?

Grigory. What? You so thick with that bailiff of yours, you housekeeping jade!

Perfilievna. Nay, he is as big a thief as you are. Do you think the barin doesn't know you? And there he is! He must have heard everything!

Grigory. Where?

Perfilievna. There—sitting by the window, and looking at us!

Next, to complete the hubbub, a serf child which had been clouted by its mother broke out into a bawl, while a borzoi puppy which had happened to get splashed with boiling water by the cook fell to yelping vociferously. In short, the place soon became a babel of shouts and squeals, and, after watching and listening for a time, the barin found it so impossible to concentrate his mind upon anything that he sent out word that the noise would have to be abated.

The next item was that, a couple of hours before luncheon time, he withdrew to his study, to set about employing himself upon a weighty work which was to consider Russia from every point of view: from the political, from the philosophical, and from the religious, as well as to resolve various problems which had arisen to confront the Empire, and to define clearly the great future to which the country stood ordained. In short, it was to be the species of compilation in which the man of the day so much delights. Yet the colossal undertaking had progressed but little beyond the sphere of projection, since, after a pen had been gnawed awhile, and a few strokes had been committed to paper, the whole would be laid aside in favour of the reading of some book; and that reading would continue also during luncheon and be followed by the lighting of a pipe, the playing of a solitary game of chess, and the doing of more or less nothing for the rest of the day.

The foregoing will give the reader a pretty clear idea of the manner in which it was possible for this man of thirty-three to waste his time. Clad constantly in slippers and a dressing-gown, Tientietnikov never went out, never indulged in any form of dissipation, and never walked upstairs. Nothing did he care for fresh air, and would bestow not a passing glance upon all those beauties of the countryside which moved visitors to such ecstatic admiration. From this the reader will see that Andrei Ivanovitch Tientietnikov belonged to that band of sluggards whom we always have with us, and who, whatever be their present appellation, used to be known by the nicknames of “lollopers,” “bed pressers,” and “marmots.” Whether the type is a type originating at birth, or a type resulting from untoward circumstances in later life, it is impossible to say. A better course than to attempt to answer that question would be to recount the story of Tientietnikov's boyhood and upbringing.

Everything connected with the latter seemed to promise success, for at twelve years of age the boy—keen-witted, but dreamy of temperament, and inclined to delicacy—was sent to an educational establishment presided over by an exceptional type of master. The idol of his pupils, and the admiration of his assistants, Alexander Petrovitch was gifted with an extraordinary measure of good sense. How thoroughly he knew the peculiarities of the Russian of his day! How well he understood boys! How capable he was of drawing them out! Not a practical joker in the school but, after perpetrating a prank, would voluntarily approach his preceptor and make to him free confession. True, the preceptor would put a stern face upon the matter, yet the culprit would depart with head held higher, not lower, than before, since in Alexander Petrovitch there was something which heartened—something which seemed to say to a delinquent: “Forward you! Rise to your feet again, even though you have fallen!” Not lectures on good behaviour was it, therefore, that fell from his lips, but rather the injunction, “I want to see intelligence, and nothing else. The boy who devotes his attention to becoming clever will never play the fool, for under such circumstances, folly disappears of itself.” And so folly did, for the boy who failed to strive in the desired direction incurred the contempt of all his comrades, and even dunces and fools of senior standing did not dare to raise a finger when saluted by their juniors with opprobrious epithets. Yet “This is too much,” certain folk would say to Alexander. “The result will be that your students will turn out prigs.” “But no,” he would reply. “Not at all. You see, I make it my principle to keep the incapables for a single term only, since that is enough for them; but to the clever ones I allot a double course of instruction.” And, true enough, any lad of brains was retained for this finishing course. Yet he did not repress all boyish playfulness, since he declared it to be as necessary as a rash to a doctor, inasmuch as it enabled him to diagnose what lay hidden within.

Consequently, how the boys loved him! Never was there such an attachment between master and pupils. And even later, during the foolish years, when foolish things attract, the measure of affection which Alexander Petrovitch retained was extraordinary. In fact, to the day of his death, every former pupil would celebrate the birthday of his late master by raising his glass in gratitude to the mentor dead and buried—then close his eyelids upon the tears which would come trickling through them. Even the slightest word of encouragement from Alexander Petrovitch could throw a lad into a transport of tremulous joy, and arouse in him an honourable emulation of his fellows. Boys of small capacity he did not long retain in his establishment; whereas those who possessed exceptional talent he put through an extra course of schooling. This senior class—a class composed of specially-selected pupils—was a very different affair from what usually obtains in other colleges. Only when a boy had attained its ranks did Alexander demand of him what other masters indiscreetly require of mere infants—namely the superior frame of mind which, while never indulging in mockery, can itself bear ridicule, and disregard the fool, and keep its temper, and repress itself, and eschew revenge, and calmly, proudly retain its tranquillity of soul. In short, whatever avails to form a boy into a man of assured character, that did Alexander Petrovitch employ during the pupil's youth, as well as constantly put him to the test. How well he understood the art of life!

Of assistant tutors he kept but few, since most of the necessary instruction he imparted in person, and, without pedantic terminology and inflated diction and views, could so transmit to his listeners the inmost spirit of a lesson that even the youngest present absorbed its essential elements. Also, of studies he selected none but those which may help a boy to become a good citizen; and therefore most of the lectures which he delivered consisted of discourses on what may be awaiting a youth, as well as of such demarcations of life's field that the pupil, though seated, as yet, only at the desk, could beforehand bear his part in that field both in thought and spirit. Nor did the master CONCEAL anything. That is to say, without mincing words, he invariably set before his hearers the sorrows and the difficulties which may confront a man, the trials and the temptations which may beset him. And this he did in terms as though, in every possible calling and capacity, he himself had experienced the same. Consequently, either the vigorous development of self-respect or the constant stimulus of the master's eye (which seemed to say to the pupil, “Forward!”— that word which has become so familiar to the contemporary Russian, that word which has worked such wonders upon his sensitive temperament); one or the other, I repeat, would from the first cause the pupil to tackle difficulties, and only difficulties, and to hunger for prowess only where the path was arduous, and obstacles were many, and it was necessary to display the utmost strength of mind. Indeed, few completed the course of which I have spoken without issuing therefrom reliable, seasoned fighters who could keep their heads in the most embarrassing of official positions, and at times when older and wiser men, distracted with the annoyances of life, had either abandoned everything or, grown slack and indifferent, had surrendered to the bribe-takers and the rascals. In short, no ex-pupil of Alexander Petrovitch ever wavered from the right road, but, familiar with life and with men, armed with the weapons of prudence, exerted a powerful influence upon wrongdoers.

For a long time past the ardent young Tientietnikov's excitable heart had also beat at the thought that one day he might attain the senior class described. And, indeed, what better teacher could he have had befall him than its preceptor? Yet just at the moment when he had been transferred thereto, just at the moment when he had reached the coveted position, did his instructor come suddenly by his death! This was indeed a blow for the boy— indeed a terrible initial loss! In his eyes everything connected with the school seemed to undergo a change—the chief reason being the fact that to the place of the deceased headmaster there succeeded a certain Thedor Ivanovitch, who at once began to insist upon certain external rules, and to demand of the boys what ought rightly to have been demanded only of adults. That is to say, since the lads' frank and open demeanour savoured to him only of lack of discipline, he announced (as though in deliberate spite of his predecessor) that he cared nothing for progress and intellect, but that heed was to be paid only to good behaviour. Yet, curiously enough, good behaviour was just what he never obtained, for every kind of secret prank became the rule; and while, by day, there reigned restraint and conspiracy, by night there began to take place chambering and wantonness.

Also, certain changes in the curriculum of studies came about, for there were engaged new teachers who held new views and opinions, and confused their hearers with a multitude of new terms and phrases, and displayed in their exposition of things both logical sequence and a zest for modern discovery and much warmth of individual bias. Yet their instruction, alas! contained no LIFE—in the mouths of those teachers a dead language savoured merely of carrion. Thus everything connected with the school underwent a radical alteration, and respect for authority and the authorities waned, and tutors and ushers came to be dubbed “Old Thedor,” “Crusty,” and the like. And sundry other things began to take place—things which necessitated many a penalty and expulsion; until, within a couple of years, no one who had known the school in former days would now have recognised it.

Nevertheless Tientietnikov, a youth of retiring disposition, experienced no leanings towards the nocturnal orgies of his companions, orgies during which the latter used to flirt with damsels before the very windows of the headmaster's rooms, nor yet towards their mockery of all that was sacred, simply because fate had cast in their way an injudicious priest. No, despite its dreaminess, his soul ever remembered its celestial origin, and could not be diverted from the path of virtue. Yet still he hung his head, for, while his ambition had come to life, it could find no sort of outlet. Truly 'twere well if it had NOT come to life, for throughout the time that he was listening to professors who gesticulated on their chairs he could not help remembering the old preceptor who, invariably cool and calm, had yet known how to make himself understood. To what subjects, to what lectures, did the boy not have to listen!—to lectures on medicine, and on philosophy, and on law, and on a version of general history so enlarged that even three years failed to enable the professor to do more than finish the introduction thereto, and also the account of the development of some self-governing towns in Germany. None of the stuff remained fixed in Tientietnikov's brain save as shapeless clots; for though his native intellect could not tell him how instruction ought to be imparted, it at least told him that THIS was not the way. And frequently, at such moments he would recall Alexander Petrovitch, and give way to such grief that scarcely did he know what he was doing.

But youth is fortunate in the fact that always before it there lies a future; and in proportion as the time for his leaving school drew nigh, Tientietnikov's heart began to beat higher and higher, and he said to himself: “This is not life, but only a preparation for life. True life is to be found in the Public Service. There at least will there be scope for activity.” So, bestowing not a glance upon that beautiful corner of the world which never failed to strike the guest or chance visitor with amazement, and reverencing not a whit the dust of his ancestors, he followed the example of most ambitious men of his class by repairing to St. Petersburg (whither, as we know, the more spirited youth of Russia from every quarter gravitates—there to enter the Public Service, to shine, to obtain promotion, and, in a word, to scale the topmost peaks of that pale, cold, deceptive elevation which is known as society). But the real starting-point of Tientietnikov's ambition was the moment when his uncle (one State Councillor Onifri Ivanovitch) instilled into him the maxim that the only means to success in the Service lay in good handwriting, and that, without that accomplishment, no one could ever hope to become a Minister or Statesman. Thus, with great difficulty, and also with the help of his uncle's influence, young Tientietnikov at length succeeded in being posted to a Department. On the day that he was conducted into a splendid, shining hall—a hall fitted with inlaid floors and lacquered desks as fine as though this were actually the place where the great ones of the Empire met for discussion of the fortunes of the State; on the day that he saw legions of handsome gentlemen of the quill-driving profession making loud scratchings with pens, and cocking their heads to one side; lastly on the day that he saw himself also allotted a desk, and requested to copy a document which appeared purposely to be one of the pettiest possible order (as a matter of fact it related to a sum of three roubles, and had taken half a year to produce)—well, at that moment a curious, an unwonted sensation seized upon the inexperienced youth, for the gentlemen around him appeared so exactly like a lot of college students. And, the further to complete the resemblance, some of them were engaged in reading trashy translated novels, which they kept hurriedly thrusting between the sheets of their apportioned work whenever the Director appeared, as though to convey the impression that it was to that work alone that they were applying themselves. In short, the scene seemed to Tientietnikov strange, and his former pursuits more important than his present, and his preparation for the Service preferable to the Service itself. Yes, suddenly he felt a longing for his old school; and as suddenly, and with all the vividness of life, there appeared before his vision the figure of Alexander Petrovitch. He almost burst into tears as he beheld his old master, and the room seemed to swim before his eyes, and the tchinovniks and the desks to become a blur, and his sight to grow dim. Then he thought to himself with an effort: “No, no! I WILL apply myself to my work, however petty it be at first.” And hardening his heart and recovering his spirit, he determined then and there to perform his duties in such a manner as should be an example to the rest.

But where are compensations to be found? Even in St. Petersburg, despite its grim and murky exterior, they exist. Yes, even though thirty degrees of keen, cracking frost may have bound the streets, and the family of the North Wind be wailing there, and the Snowstorm Witch have heaped high the pavements, and be blinding the eyes, and powdering beards and fur collars and the shaggy manes of horses—even THEN there will be shining hospitably through the swirling snowflakes a fourth-floor window where, in a cosy room, and by the light of modest candles, and to the hiss of the samovar, there will be in progress a discussion which warms the heart and soul, or else a reading aloud of a brilliant page of one of those inspired Russian poets with whom God has dowered us, while the breast of each member of the company is heaving with a rapture unknown under a noontide sky.

Gradually, therefore, Tientietnikov grew more at home in the Service. Yet never did it become, for him, the main pursuit, the main object in life, which he had expected. No, it remained but one of a secondary kind. That is to say, it served merely to divide up his time, and enable him the more to value his hours of leisure. Nevertheless, just when his uncle was beginning to flatter himself that his nephew was destined to succeed in the profession, the said nephew elected to ruin his every hope. Thus it befell. Tientietnikov's friends (he had many) included among their number a couple of fellows of the species known as “embittered.” That is to say, though good-natured souls of that curiously restless type which cannot endure injustice, nor anything which it conceives to be such, they were thoroughly unbalanced of conduct themselves, and, while demanding general agreement with their views, treated those of others with the scantiest of ceremony. Nevertheless these two associates exercised upon Tientietnikov—both by the fire of their eloquence and by the form of their noble dissatisfaction with society—a very strong influence; with the result that, through arousing in him an innate tendency to nervous resentment, they led him also to notice trifles which before had escaped his attention. An instance of this is seen in the fact that he conceived against Thedor Thedorovitch Lienitsin, Director of one of the Departments which was quartered in the splendid range of offices before mentioned, a dislike which proved the cause of his discerning n the man a host of hitherto unmarked imperfections. Above all things did Tientietnikov take it into his head that, when conversing with his superiors, Lienitsin became, of the moment, a stick of luscious sweetmeat, but that, when conversing with his inferiors, he approximated more to a vinegar cruet. Certain it is that, like all petty-minded individuals, Lienitsin made a note of any one who failed to offer him a greeting on festival days, and that he revenged himself upon any one whose visiting-card had not been handed to his butler. Eventually the youth's aversion almost attained the point of hysteria; until he felt that, come what might, he MUST insult the fellow in some fashion. To that task he applied himself con amore; and so thoroughly that he met with complete success. That is to say, he seized on an occasion to address Lienitsin in such fashion that the delinquent received notice either to apologies or to leave the Service; and when of these alternatives he chose the latter his uncle came to him, and made a terrified appeal. “For God's sake remember what you are doing!” he cried. “To think that, after beginning your career so well, you should abandon it merely for the reason that you have not fallen in with the sort of Director whom you prefer! What do you mean by it, what do you mean by it? Were others to regard things in the same way, the Service would find itself without a single individual. Reconsider your conduct—forego your pride and conceit, and make Lienitsin amends.”

“But, dear Uncle,” the nephew replied, “that is not the point. The point is, not that I should find an apology difficult to offer, seeing that, since Lienitsin is my superior, and I ought not to have addressed him as I did, I am clearly in the wrong. Rather, the point is the following. To my charge there has been committed the performance of another kind of service. That is to say, I am the owner of three hundred peasant souls, a badly administered estate, and a fool of a bailiff. That being so, whereas the State will lose little by having to fill my stool with another copyist, it will lose very much by causing three hundred peasant souls to fail in the payment of their taxes. As I say (how am I to put it?), I am a landowner who has preferred to enter the Public Service. Now, should I employ myself henceforth in conserving, restoring, and improving the fortunes of the souls whom God has entrusted to my care, and thereby provide the State with three hundred law-abiding, sober, hard-working taxpayers, how will that service of mine rank as inferior to the service of a department-directing fool like Lienitsin?”

On hearing this speech, the State Councillor could only gape, for he had not expected Tientietnikov's torrent of words. He reflected a few moments, and then murmured:

“Yes, but, but—but how can a man like you retire to rustication in the country? What society will you get there? Here one meets at least a general or a prince sometimes; indeed, no matter whom you pass in the street, that person represents gas lamps and European civilisation; but in the country, no matter what part of it you are in, not a soul is to be encountered save muzhiks and their women. Why should you go and condemn yourself to a state of vegetation like that?”

Nevertheless the uncle's expostulations fell upon deaf ears, for already the nephew was beginning to think of his estate as a retreat of a type more likely to nourish the intellectual faculties and afford the only profitable field of activity. After unearthing one or two modern works on agriculture, therefore, he, two weeks later, found himself in the neighbourhood of the home where his boyhood had been spent, and approaching the spot which never failed to enthral the visitor or guest. And in the young man's breast there was beginning to palpitate a new feeling—in the young man's soul there were reawakening old, long-concealed impressions; with the result that many a spot which had long been faded from his memory now filled him with interest, and the beautiful views on the estate found him gazing at them like a newcomer, and with a beating heart. Yes, as the road wound through a narrow ravine, and became engulfed in a forest where, both above and below, he saw three-centuries-old oaks which three men could not have spanned, and where Siberian firs and elms overtopped even the poplars, and as he asked the peasants to tell him to whom the forest belonged, and they replied, “To Tientietnikov,” and he issued from the forest, and proceeded on his way through meadows, and past spinneys of elder, and of old and young willows, and arrived in sight of the distant range of hills, and, crossing by two different bridges the winding river (which he left successively to right and to left of him as he did so), he again questioned some peasants concerning the ownership of the meadows and the flooded lands, and was again informed that they all belonged to Tientietnikov, and then, ascending a rise, reached a tableland where, on one side, lay ungarnered fields of wheat and rye and barley, and, on the other, the country already traversed (but which now showed in shortened perspective), and then plunged into the shade of some forked, umbrageous trees which stood scattered over turf and extended to the manor-house itself, and caught glimpses of the carved huts of the peasants, and of the red roofs of the stone manorial outbuildings, and of the glittering pinnacles of the church, and felt his heart beating, and knew, without being told by any one, whither he had at length arrived—well, then the feeling which had been growing within his soul burst forth, and he cried in ecstasy:

“Why have I been a fool so long? Why, seeing that fate has appointed me to be ruler of an earthly paradise, did I prefer to bind myself in servitude as a scribe of lifeless documents? To think that, after I had been nurtured and schooled and stored with all the knowledge necessary for the diffusion of good among those under me, and for the improvement of my domain, and for the fulfilment of the manifold duties of a landowner who is at once judge, administrator, and constable of his people, I should have entrusted my estate to an ignorant bailiff, and sought to maintain an absentee guardianship over the affairs of serfs whom I have never met, and of whose capabilities and characters I am yet ignorant! To think that I should have deemed true estate-management inferior to a documentary, fantastical management of provinces which lie a thousand versts away, and which my foot has never trod, and where I could never have effected aught but blunders and irregularities!”

Meanwhile another spectacle was being prepared for him. On learning that the barin was approaching the mansion, the muzhiks collected on the verandah in very variety of picturesque dress and tonsure; and when these good folk surrounded him, and there arose a resounding shout of “Here is our Foster Father! He has remembered us!” and, in spite of themselves, some of the older men and women began weeping as they recalled his grandfather and great-grandfather, he himself could not restrain his tears, but reflected: “How much affection! And in return for what? In return for my never having come to see them—in return for my never having taken the least interest in their affairs!” And then and there he registered a mental vow to share their every task and occupation.

So he applied himself to supervising and administering. He reduced the amount of the barstchina , he decreased the number of working-days for the owner, and he augmented the sum of the peasants' leisure-time. He also dismissed the fool of a bailiff, and took to bearing a personal hand in everything—to being present in the fields, at the threshing-floor, at the kilns, at the wharf, at the freighting of barges and rafts, and at their conveyance down the river: wherefore even the lazy hands began to look to themselves. But this did not last long. The peasant is an observant individual, and Tientietnikov's muzhiks soon scented the fact that, though energetic and desirous of doing much, the barin had no notion how to do it, nor even how to set about it—that, in short, he spoke by the book rather than out of his personal knowledge. Consequently things resulted, not in master and men failing to understand one another, but in their not singing together, in their not producing the very same note.

That is to say, it was not long before Tientietnikov noticed that on the manorial lands, nothing prospered to the extent that it did on the peasants'. The manorial crops were sown in good time, and came up well, and every one appeared to work his best, so much so that Tientietnikov, who supervised the whole, frequently ordered mugs of vodka to be served out as a reward for the excellence of the labour performed. Yet the rye on the peasants' land had formed into ear, and the oats had begun to shoot their grain, and the millet had filled before, on the manorial lands, the corn had so much as grown to stalk, or the ears had sprouted in embryo. In short, gradually the barin realised that, in spite of favours conferred, the peasants were playing the rogue with him. Next he resorted to remonstrance, but was met with the reply, “How could we not do our best for our barin? You yourself saw how well we laboured at the ploughing and the sowing, for you gave us mugs of vodka for our pains.”

“Then why have things turned out so badly?” the barin persisted.

“Who can say? It must be that a grub has eaten the crop from below. Besides, what a summer has it been—never a drop of rain!”

Nevertheless, the barin noted that no grub had eaten the PEASANTS' crops, as well as that the rain had fallen in the most curious fashion—namely, in patches. It had obliged the muzhiks, but had shed a mere sprinkling for the barin.

Still more difficult did he find it to deal with the peasant women. Ever and anon they would beg to be excused from work, or start making complaints of the severity of the barstchina. Indeed, they were terrible folk! However, Tientietnikov abolished the majority of the tithes of linen, hedge fruit, mushrooms, and nuts, and also reduced by one-half other tasks proper to the women, in the hope that they would devote their spare time to their own domestic concerns—namely, to sewing and mending, and to making clothes for their husbands, and to increasing the area of their kitchen gardens. Yet no such result came about. On the contrary, such a pitch did the idleness, the quarrelsomeness, and the intriguing and caballing of the fair sex attain that their helpmeets were for ever coming to the barin with a request that he would rid one or another of his wife, since she had become a nuisance, and to live with her was impossible.

Next, hardening his heart, the barin attempted severity. But of what avail was severity? The peasant woman remained always the peasant woman, and would come and whine that she was sick and ailing, and keep pitifully hugging to herself the mean and filthy rags which she had donned for the occasion. And when poor Tientietnikov found himself unable to say more to her than just, “Get out of my sight, and may the Lord go with you!” the next item in the comedy would be that he would see her, even as she was leaving his gates, fall to contending with a neighbour for, say, the possession of a turnip, and dealing out slaps in the face such as even a strong, healthy man could scarcely have compassed!

Again, amongst other things, Tientietnikov conceived the idea of establishing a school for his people; but the scheme resulted in a farce which left him in sackcloth and ashes. In the same way he found that, when it came to a question of dispensing justice and of adjusting disputes, the host of juridical subtleties with which the professors had provided him proved absolutely useless. That is to say, the one party lied, and the other party lied, and only the devil could have decided between them. Consequently he himself perceived that a knowledge of mankind would have availed him more than all the legal refinements and philosophical maxims in the world could do. He lacked something; and though he could not divine what it was, the situation brought about was the common one of the barin failing to understand the peasant, and the peasant failing to understand the barin, and both becoming disaffected. In the end, these difficulties so chilled Tientietnikov's enthusiasm that he took to supervising the labours of the field with greatly diminished attention. That is to say, no matter whether the scythes were softly swishing through the grass, or ricks were being built, or rafts were being loaded, he would allow his eyes to wander from his men, and to fall to gazing at, say, a red-billed, red-legged heron which, after strutting along the bank of a stream, would have caught a fish in its beak, and be holding it awhile, as though in doubt whether to swallow it. Next he would glance towards the spot where a similar bird, but one not yet in possession of a fish, was engaged in watching the doings of its mate. Lastly, with eyebrows knitted, and face turned to scan the zenith, he would drink in the smell of the fields, and fall to listening to the winged population of the air as from earth and sky alike the manifold music of winged creatures combined in a single harmonious chorus. In the rye the quail would be calling, and, in the grass, the corncrake, and over them would be wheeling flocks of twittering linnets. Also, the jacksnipe would be uttering its croak, and the lark executing its roulades where it had become lost in the sunshine, and cranes sending forth their trumpet-like challenge as they deployed towards the zenith in triangle-shaped flocks. In fact, the neighbourhood would seem to have become converted into one great concert of melody. O Creator, how fair is Thy world where, in remote, rural seclusion, it lies apart from cities and from highways!

But soon even this began to pall upon Tientietnikov, and he ceased altogether to visit his fields, or to do aught but shut himself up in his rooms, where he refused to receive even the bailiff when that functionary called with his reports. Again, although, until now, he had to a certain extent associated with a retired colonel of hussars—a man saturated with tobacco smoke—and also with a student of pronounced, but immature, opinions who culled the bulk of his wisdom from contemporary newspapers and pamphlets, he found, as time went on, that these companions proved as tedious as the rest, and came to think their conversation superficial, and their European method of comporting themselves—that is to say, the method of conversing with much slapping of knees and a great deal of bowing and gesticulation—too direct and unadorned. So these and every one else he decided to “drop,” and carried this resolution into effect with a certain amount of rudeness. On the next occasion that Varvar Nikolaievitch Vishnepokromov called to indulge in a free-and-easy symposium on politics, philosophy, literature, morals, and the state of financial affairs in England (he was, in all matters which admit of superficial discussion, the pleasantest fellow alive, seeing that he was a typical representative both of the retired fire-eater and of the school of thought which is now becoming the rage)—when, I say, this next happened, Tientietnikov merely sent out to say that he was not at home, and then carefully showed himself at the window. Host and guest exchanged glances, and, while the one muttered through his teeth “The cur!” the other relieved his feelings with a remark or two on swine. Thus the acquaintance came to an abrupt end, and from that time forth no visitor called at the mansion.

Tientietnikov in no way regretted this, for he could now devote himself wholly to the projection of a great work on Russia. Of the scale on which this composition was conceived the reader is already aware. The reader also knows how strange, how unsystematic, was the system employed in it. Yet to say that Tientietnikov never awoke from his lethargy would not be altogether true. On the contrary, when the post brought him newspapers and reviews, and he saw in their printed pages, perhaps, the well-known name of some former comrade who had succeeded in the great field of Public Service, or had conferred upon science and the world's work some notable contribution, he would succumb to secret and suppressed grief, and involuntarily there would burst from his soul an expression of aching, voiceless regret that he himself had done so little. And at these times his existence would seem to him odious and repellent; at these times there would uprise before him the memory of his school days, and the figure of Alexander Petrovitch, as vivid as in life. And, slowly welling, the tears would course over Tientietnikov's cheeks.

What meant these repinings? Was there not disclosed in them the secret of his galling spiritual pain—the fact that he had failed to order his life aright, to confirm the lofty aims with which he had started his course; the fact that, always poorly equipped with experience, he had failed to attain the better and the higher state, and there to strengthen himself for the overcoming of hindrances and obstacles; the fact that, dissolving like overheated metal, his bounteous store of superior instincts had failed to take the final tempering; the fact that the tutor of his boyhood, a man in a thousand, had prematurely died, and left to Tientietnikov no one who could restore to him the moral strength shattered by vacillation and the will power weakened by want of virility—no one, in short, who could cry hearteningly to his soul “Forward!”—the word for which the Russian of every degree, of every class, of every occupation, of every school of thought, is for ever hungering.

Indeed, WHERE is the man who can cry aloud for any of us, in the Russian tongue dear to our soul, the all-compelling command “Forward!”? Who is there who, knowing the strength and the nature and the inmost depths of the Russian genius, can by a single magic incantation divert our ideals to the higher life? Were there such a man, with what tears, with what affection, would not the grateful sons of Russia repay him! Yet age succeeds to age, and our callow youth still lies wrapped in shameful sloth, or strives and struggles to no purpose. God has not yet given us the man able to sound the call.

One circumstance which almost aroused Tientietnikov, which almost brought about a revolution in his character, was the fact that he came very near to falling in love. Yet even this resulted in nothing. Ten versts away there lived the general whom we have heard expressing himself in highly uncomplimentary terms concerning Tientietnikov. He maintained a General-like establishment, dispensed hospitality (that is to say, was glad when his neighbours came to pay him their respects, though he himself never went out), spoke always in a hoarse voice, read a certain number of books, and had a daughter—a curious, unfamiliar type, but full of life as life itself. This maiden's name was Ulinka, and she had been strangely brought up, for, losing her mother in early childhood, she had subsequently received instruction at the hands of an English governess who knew not a single word of Russian. Moreover her father, though excessively fond of her, treated her always as a toy; with the result that, as she grew to years of discretion, she became wholly wayward and spoilt. Indeed, had any one seen the sudden rage which would gather on her beautiful young forehead when she was engaged in a heated dispute with her father, he would have thought her one of the most capricious beings in the world. Yet that rage gathered only when she had heard of injustice or harsh treatment, and never because she desired to argue on her own behalf, or to attempt to justify her own conduct. Also, that anger would disappear as soon as ever she saw any one whom she had formerly disliked fall upon evil times, and, at his first request for alms would, without consideration or subsequent regret, hand him her purse and its whole contents. Yes, her every act was strenuous, and when she spoke her whole personality seemed to be following hot-foot upon her thought—both her expression of face and her diction and the movements of her hands. Nay, the very folds of her frock had a similar appearance of striving; until one would have thought that all her self were flying in pursuit of her words. Nor did she know reticence: before any one she would disclose her mind, and no force could compel her to maintain silence when she desired to speak. Also, her enchanting, peculiar gait—a gait which belonged to her alone—was so absolutely free and unfettered that every one involuntarily gave her way. Lastly, in her presence churls seemed to become confused and fall to silence, and even the roughest and most outspoken would lose their heads, and have not a word to say; whereas the shy man would find himself able to converse as never in his life before, and would feel, from the first, as though he had seen her and known her at some previous period—during the days of some unremembered childhood, when he was at home, and spending a merry evening among a crowd of romping children. And for long afterwards he would feel as though his man's intellect and estate were a burden.

This was what now befell Tientietnikov; and as it did so a new feeling entered into his soul, and his dreamy life lightened for a moment.

At first the General used to receive him with hospitable civility, but permanent concord between them proved impossible; their conversation always merged into dissension and soreness, seeing that, while the General could not bear to be contradicted or worsted in an argument, Tientietnikov was a man of extreme sensitiveness. True, for the daughter's sake, the father was for a while deferred to, and thus peace was maintained; but this lasted only until the time when there arrived, on a visit to the General, two kinswomen of his—the Countess Bordirev and the Princess Uziakin, retired Court dames, but ladies who still kept up a certain connection with Court circles, and therefore were much fawned upon by their host. No sooner had they appeared on the scene than (so it seemed to Tientietnikov) the General's attitude towards the young man became colder—either he ceased to notice him at all or he spoke to him familiarly, and as to a person having no standing in society. This offended Tientietnikov deeply, and though, when at length he spoke out on the subject, he retained sufficient presence of mind to compress his lips, and to preserve a gentle and courteous tone, his face flushed and his inner man was boiling.

“General,” he said, “I thank you for your condescension. By addressing me in the second person singular, you have admitted me to the circle of your most intimate friends. Indeed, were it not that a difference of years forbids any familiarity on my part, I should answer you in similar fashion.”

The General sat aghast. At length, rallying his tongue and his faculties, he replied that, though he had spoken with a lack of ceremony, he had used the term “thou” merely as an elderly man naturally employs it towards a junior (he made no reference to difference of rank).

Nevertheless, the acquaintance broke off here, and with it any possibility of love-making. The light which had shed a momentary gleam before Tientietnikov's eyes had become extinguished for ever, and upon it there followed a darkness denser than before. Henceforth everything conduced to evolve the regime which the reader has noted—that regime of sloth and inaction which converted Tientietnikov's residence into a place of dirt and neglect. For days at a time would a broom and a heap of dust be left lying in the middle of a room, and trousers tossing about the salon, and pairs of worn-out braces adorning the what-not near the sofa. In short, so mean and untidy did Tientietnikov's mode of life become, that not only his servants, but even his very poultry ceased to treat him with respect. Taking up a pen, he would spend hours in idly sketching houses, huts, waggons, troikas, and flourishes on a piece of paper; while at other times, when he had sunk into a reverie, the pen would, all unknowingly, sketch a small head which had delicate features, a pair of quick, penetrating eyes, and a raised coiffure. Then suddenly the dreamer would perceive, to his surprise, that the pen had executed the portrait of a maiden whose picture no artist could adequately have painted; and therewith his despondency would become greater than ever, and, believing that happiness did not exist on earth, he would relapse into increased ennui, increased neglect of his responsibilities.

But one morning he noticed, on moving to the window after breakfast, that not a word was proceeding either from the butler or the housekeeper, but that, on the contrary, the courtyard seemed to smack of a certain bustle and excitement. This was because through the entrance gates (which the kitchen maid and the scullion had run to open) there were appearing the noses of three horses—one to the right, one in the middle, and one to the left, after the fashion of triumphal groups of statuary. Above them, on the box seat, were seated a coachman and a valet, while behind, again, there could be discerned a gentleman in a scarf and a fur cap. Only when the equipage had entered the courtyard did it stand revealed as a light spring britchka. And as it came to a halt, there leapt on to the verandah of the mansion an individual of respectable exterior, and possessed of the art of moving with the neatness and alertness of a military man.

Upon this Tientietnikov's heart stood still. He was unused to receiving visitors, and for the moment conceived the new arrival to be a Government official, sent to question him concerning an abortive society to which he had formerly belonged. (Here the author may interpolate the fact that, in Tientietnikov's early days, the young man had become mixed up in a very absurd affair. That is to say, a couple of philosophers belonging to a regiment of hussars had, together with an aesthete who had not yet completed his student's course and a gambler who had squandered his all, formed a secret society of philanthropic aims under the presidency of a certain old rascal of a freemason and the ruined gambler aforesaid. The scope of the society's work was to be extensive: it was to bring lasting happiness to humanity at large, from the banks of the Thames to the shores of Kamtchatka. But for this much money was needed: wherefore from the noble-minded members of the society generous contributions were demanded, and then forwarded to a destination known only to the supreme authorities of the concern. As for Tientietnikov's adhesion, it was brought about by the two friends already alluded to as “embittered”—good-hearted souls whom the wear and tear of their efforts on behalf of science, civilisation, and the future emancipation of mankind had ended by converting into confirmed drunkards. Perhaps it need hardly be said that Tientietnikov soon discovered how things stood, and withdrew from the association; but, meanwhile, the latter had had the misfortune so to have engaged in dealings not wholly creditable to gentlemen of noble origin as likewise to have become entangled in dealings with the police. Consequently, it is not to be wondered at that, though Tientietnikov had long severed his connection with the society and its policy, he still remained uneasy in his mind as to what might even yet be the result.)

However, his fears vanished the instant that the guest saluted him with marked politeness and explained, with many deferential poises of the head, and in terms at once civil and concise, that for some time past he (the newcomer) had been touring the Russian Empire on business and in the pursuit of knowledge, that the Empire abounded in objects of interest—not to mention a plenitude of manufactures and a great diversity of soil, and that, in spite of the fact that he was greatly struck with the amenities of his host's domain, he would certainly not have presumed to intrude at such an inconvenient hour but for the circumstance that the inclement spring weather, added to the state of the roads, had necessitated sundry repairs to his carriage at the hands of wheelwrights and blacksmiths. Finally he declared that, even if this last had NOT happened, he would still have felt unable to deny himself the pleasure of offering to his host that meed of homage which was the latter's due.

This speech—a speech of fascinating bonhomie—delivered, the guest executed a sort of shuffle with a half-boot of patent leather studded with buttons of mother-of-pearl, and followed that up by (in spite of his pronounced rotundity of figure) stepping backwards with all the élanof an india-rubber ball.

From this the somewhat reassured Tientietnikov concluded that his visitor must be a literary, knowledge-seeking professor who was engaged in roaming the country in search of botanical specimens and fossils; wherefore he hastened to express both his readiness to further the visitor's objects (whatever they might be) and his personal willingness to provide him with the requisite wheelwrights and blacksmiths. Meanwhile he begged his guest to consider himself at home, and, after seating him in an armchair, made preparations to listen to the newcomer's discourse on natural history.

But the newcomer applied himself, rather, to phenomena of the internal world, saying that his life might be likened to a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows, that in his time he had been fated to play many parts, and that on more than one occasion his life had stood in danger at the hands of foes. At the same time, these tidings were communicated in a manner calculated to show that the speaker was also a man of PRACTICAL capabilities. In conclusion, the visitor took out a cambric pocket-handkerchief, and sneezed into it with a vehemence wholly new to Tientietnikov's experience. In fact, the sneeze rather resembled the note which, at times, the trombone of an orchestra appears to utter not so much from its proper place on the platform as from the immediate neighbourhood of the listener's ear. And as the echoes of the drowsy mansion resounded to the report of the explosion there followed upon the same a wave of perfume, skilfully wafted abroad with a flourish of the eau-de-Cologne-scented handkerchief.

By this time the reader will have guessed that the visitor was none other than our old and respected friend Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov. Naturally, time had not spared him his share of anxieties and alarms; wherefore his exterior had come to look a trifle more elderly, his frockcoat had taken on a suggestion of shabbiness, and britchka, coachman, valet, horses, and harness alike had about them a sort of second-hand, worse-for-wear effect. Evidently the Chichikovian finances were not in the most flourishing of conditions. Nevertheless, the old expression of face, the old air of breeding and refinement, remained unimpaired, and our hero had even improved in the art of walking and turning with grace, and of dexterously crossing one leg over the other when taking a seat. Also, his mildness of diction, his discreet moderation of word and phrase, survived in, if anything, increased measure, and he bore himself with a skill which caused his tactfulness to surpass itself in sureness of aplomb. And all these accomplishments had their effect further heightened by a snowy immaculateness of collar and dickey, and an absence of dust from his frockcoat, as complete as though he had just arrived to attend a nameday festival. Lastly, his cheeks and chin were of such neat cleanshavenness that no one but a blind man could have failed to admire their rounded contours.

From that moment onwards great changes took place in Tientietnikov's establishment, and certain of its rooms assumed an unwonted air of cleanliness and order. The rooms in question were those assigned to Chichikov, while one other apartment—a little front chamber opening into the hall—became permeated with Petrushka's own peculiar smell. But this lasted only for a little while, for presently Petrushka was transferred to the servants' quarters, a course which ought to have been adopted in the first instance.

During the initial days of Chichikov's sojourn, Tientietnikov feared rather to lose his independence, inasmuch as he thought that his guest might hamper his movements, and bring about alterations in the established routine of the place. But these fears proved groundless, for Paul Ivanovitch displayed an extraordinary aptitude for accommodating himself to his new position. To begin with, he encouraged his host in his philosophical inertia by saying that the latter would help Tientietnikov to become a centenarian. Next, in the matter of a life of isolation, he hit things off exactly by remarking that such a life bred in a man a capacity for high thinking. Lastly, as he inspected the library and dilated on books in general, he contrived an opportunity to observe that literature safeguarded a man from a tendency to waste his time. In short, the few words of which he delivered himself were brief, but invariably to the point. And this discretion of speech was outdone by his discretion of conduct. That is to say, whether entering or leaving the room, he never wearied his host with a question if Tientietnikov had the air of being disinclined to talk; and with equal satisfaction the guest could either play chess or hold his tongue. Consequently Tientietnikov said to himself:

“For the first time in my life I have met with a man with whom it is possible to live. In general, not many of the type exist in Russia, and, though clever, good-humoured, well-educated men abound, one would be hard put to it to find an individual of equable temperament with whom one could share a roof for centuries without a quarrel arising. Anyway, Chichikov is the first of his sort that I have met.”

For his part, Chichikov was only too delighted to reside with a person so quiet and agreeable as his host. Of a wandering life he was temporarily weary, and to rest, even for a month, in such a beautiful spot, and in sight of green fields and the slow flowering of spring, was likely to benefit him also from the hygienic point of view. And, indeed, a more delightful retreat in which to recuperate could not possibly have been found. The spring, long retarded by previous cold, had now begun in all its comeliness, and life was rampant. Already, over the first emerald of the grass, the dandelion was showing yellow, and the red-pink anemone was hanging its tender head; while the surface of every pond was a swarm of dancing gnats and midges, and the water-spider was being joined in their pursuit by birds which gathered from every quarter to the vantage-ground of the dry reeds. Every species of creature also seemed to be assembling in concourse, and taking stock of one another. Suddenly the earth became populous, the forest had opened its eyes, and the meadows were lifting up their voice in song. In the same way had choral dances begun to be weaved in the village, and everywhere that the eye turned there was merriment. What brightness in the green of nature, what freshness in the air, what singing of birds in the gardens of the mansion, what general joy and rapture and exaltation! Particularly in the village might the shouting and singing have been in honour of a wedding!

Chichikov walked hither, thither, and everywhere—a pursuit for which there was ample choice and facility. At one time he would direct his steps along the edge of the flat tableland, and contemplate the depths below, where still there lay sheets of water left by the floods of winter, and where the island-like patches of forest showed leafless boughs; while at another time he would plunge into the thicket and ravine country, where nests of birds weighted branches almost to the ground, and the sky was darkened with the criss-cross flight of cawing rooks. Again, the drier portions of the meadows could be crossed to the river wharves, whence the first barges were just beginning to set forth with pea-meal and barley and wheat, while at the same time one's ear would be caught with the sound of some mill resuming its functions as once more the water turned the wheel. Chichikov would also walk afield to watch the early tillage operations of the season, and observe how the blackness of a new furrow would make its way across the expanse of green, and how the sower, rhythmically striking his hand against the pannier slung across his breast, would scatter his fistfuls of seed with equal distribution, apportioning not a grain too much to one side or to the other.

In fact, Chichikov went everywhere. He chatted and talked, now with the bailiff, now with a peasant, now with a miller, and inquired into the manner and nature of everything, and sought information as to how an estate was managed, and at what price corn was selling, and what species of grain was best for spring and autumn grinding, and what was the name of each peasant, and who were his kinsfolk, and where he had bought his cow, and what he fed his pigs on. Chichikov also made inquiry concerning the number of peasants who had lately died: but of these there appeared to be few. And suddenly his quick eye discerned that Tientietnikov's estate was not being worked as it might have been—that much neglect and listlessness and pilfering and drunkenness was abroad; and on perceiving this, he thought to himself: “What a fool is that Tientietnikov! To think of letting a property like this decay when he might be drawing from it an income of fifty thousand roubles a year!”

Also, more than once, while taking these walks, our hero pondered the idea of himself becoming a landowner—not now, of course, but later, when his chief aim should have been achieved, and he had got into his hands the necessary means for living the quiet life of the proprietor of an estate. Yes, and at these times there would include itself in his castle-building the figure of a young, fresh, fair-faced maiden of the mercantile or other rich grade of society, a woman who could both play and sing. He also dreamed of little descendants who should perpetuate the name of Chichikov; perhaps a frolicsome little boy and a fair young daughter, or possibly, two boys and quite two or three daughters; so that all should know that he had really lived and had his being, that he had not merely roamed the world like a spectre or a shadow; so that for him and his the country should never be put to shame. And from that he would go on to fancy that a title appended to his rank would not be a bad thing—the title of State Councillor, for instance, which was deserving of all honour and respect. Ah, it is a common thing for a man who is taking a solitary walk so to detach himself from the irksome realities of the present that he is able to stir and to excite and to provoke his imagination to the conception of things he knows can never really come to pass!

Chichikov's servants also found the mansion to their taste, and, like their master, speedily made themselves at home in it. In particular did Petrushka make friends with Grigory the butler, although at first the pair showed a tendency to outbrag one another—Petrushka beginning by throwing dust in Grigory's eyes on the score of his (Petrushka's) travels, and Grigory taking him down a peg or two by referring to St. Petersburg (a city which Petrushka had never visited), and Petrushka seeking to recover lost ground by dilating on towns which he HAD visited, and Grigory capping this by naming some town which is not to be found on any map in existence, and then estimating the journey thither as at least thirty thousand versts—a statement which would so completely flabbergast the henchman of Chichikov's suite that he would be left staring open-mouthed, amid the general laughter of the domestic staff. However, as I say, the pair ended by swearing eternal friendship with one another, and making a practice of resorting to the village tavern in company.

For Selifan, however, the place had a charm of a different kind. That is to say, each evening there would take place in the village a singing of songs and a weaving of country dances; and so shapely and buxom were the maidens—maidens of a type hard to find in our present-day villages on large estates—that he would stand for hours wondering which of them was the best. White-necked and white-bosomed, all had great roving eyes, the gait of peacocks, and hair reaching to the waist. And as, with his hands clasping theirs, he glided hither and thither in the dance, or retired backwards towards a wall with a row of other young fellows, and then, with them, returned to meet the damsels—all singing in chorus (and laughing as they sang it), “Boyars, show me my bridegroom!” and dusk was falling gently, and from the other side of the river there kept coming far, faint, plaintive echoes of the melody—well, then our Selifan hardly knew whether he were standing upon his head or his heels. Later, when sleeping and when waking, both at noon and at twilight, he would seem still to be holding a pair of white hands, and moving in the dance.

Chichikov's horses also found nothing of which to disapprove. Yes, both the bay, the Assessor, and the skewbald accounted residence at Tientietnikov's a most comfortable affair, and voted the oats excellent, and the arrangement of the stables beyond all cavil. True, on this occasion each horse had a stall to himself; yet, by looking over the intervening partition, it was possible always to see one's fellows, and, should a neighbour take it into his head to utter a neigh, to answer it at once.

As for the errand which had hitherto led Chichikov to travel about Russia, he had now decided to move very cautiously and secretly in the matter. In fact, on noticing that Tientietnikov went in absorbedly for reading and for talking philosophy, the visitor said to himself, “No—I had better begin at the other end,” and proceeded first to feel his way among the servants of the establishment. From them he learnt several things, and, in particular, that the barin had been wont to go and call upon a certain General in the neighbourhood, and that the General possessed a daughter, and that she and Tientietnikov had had an affair of some sort, but that the pair had subsequently parted, and gone their several ways. For that matter, Chichikov himself had noticed that Tientietnikov was in the habit of drawing heads of which each representation exactly resembled the rest.

Once, as he sat tapping his silver snuff-box after luncheon, Chichikov remarked:

“One thing you lack, and only one, Andrei Ivanovitch.”

“What is that?” asked his host.

“A female friend or two,” replied Chichikov. Tientietnikov made no rejoinder, and the conversation came temporarily to an end.

But Chichikov was not to be discouraged; wherefore, while waiting for supper and talking on different subjects, he seized an opportunity to interject:

“Do you know, it would do you no harm to marry.”

As before, Tientietnikov did not reply, and the renewed mention of the subject seemed to have annoyed him.

For the third time—it was after supper—Chichikov returned to the charge by remarking:

“To-day, as I was walking round your property, I could not help thinking that marriage would do you a great deal of good. Otherwise you will develop into a hypochondriac.”

Whether Chichikov's words now voiced sufficiently the note of persuasion, or whether Tientietnikov happened, at the moment, to be unusually disposed to frankness, at all events the young landowner sighed, and then responded as he expelled a puff of tobacco smoke:

“To attain anything, Paul Ivanovitch, one needs to have been born under a lucky star.”

And he related to his guest the whole history of his acquaintanceship and subsequent rupture with the General.

As Chichikov listened to the recital, and gradually realised that the affair had arisen merely out of a chance word on the General's part, he was astounded beyond measure, and gazed at Tientietnikov without knowing what to make of him.

“Andrei Ivanovitch,” he said at length, “what was there to take offence at?”

“Nothing, as regards the actual words spoken,” replied the other. “The offence lay, rather, in the insult conveyed in the General's tone.” Tientietnikov was a kindly and peaceable man, yet his eyes flashed as he said this, and his voice vibrated with wounded feeling.

“Yet, even then, need you have taken it so much amiss?”

“What? Could I have gone on visiting him as before?”

“Certainly. No great harm had been done?”

“I disagree with you. Had he been an old man in a humble station of life, instead of a proud and swaggering officer, I should not have minded so much. But, as it was, I could not, and would not, brook his words.”

“A curious fellow, this Tientietnikov!” thought Chichikov to himself.

“A curious fellow, this Chichikov!” was Tientietnikov's inward reflection.

“I tell you what,” resumed Chichikov. “To-morrow I myself will go and see the General.”

“To what purpose?” asked Tientietnikov, with astonishment and distrust in his eyes.

“To offer him an assurance of my personal respect.”

“A strange fellow, this Chichikov!” reflected Tientietnikov.

“A strange fellow, this Tientietnikov!” thought Chichikov, and then added aloud: “Yes, I will go and see him at ten o'clock to-morrow; but since my britchka is not yet altogether in travelling order, would you be so good as to lend me your koliaska for the purpose?”





CHAPTER II


Tientietnikov's good horses covered the ten versts to the General's house in a little over half an hour. Descending from the koliaska with features attuned to deference, Chichikov inquired for the master of the house, and was at once ushered into his presence. Bowing with head held respectfully on one side and hands extended like those of a waiter carrying a trayful of teacups, the visitor inclined his whole body forward, and said:

“I have deemed it my duty to present myself to your Excellency. I have deemed it my duty because in my heart I cherish a most profound respect for the valiant men who, on the field of battle, have proved the saviours of their country.”

That this preliminary attack did not wholly displease the General was proved by the fact that, responding with a gracious inclination of the head, he replied:

“I am glad to make your acquaintance. Pray be so good as to take a seat. In what capacity or capacities have you yourself seen service?”

“Of my service,” said Chichikov, depositing his form, not exactly in the centre of the chair, but rather on one side of it, and resting a hand upon one of its arms, “—of my service the scene was laid, in the first instance, in the Treasury; while its further course bore me successively into the employ of the Public Buildings Commission, of the Customs Board, and of other Government Offices. But, throughout, my life has resembled a barque tossed on the crests of perfidious billows. In suffering I have been swathed and wrapped until I have come to be, as it were, suffering personified; while of the extent to which my life has been sought by foes, no words, no colouring, no (if I may so express it?) painter's brush could ever convey to you an adequate idea. And now, at length, in my declining years, I am seeking a corner in which to eke out the remainder of my miserable existence, while at the present moment I am enjoying the hospitality of a neighbour of your acquaintance.”

“And who is that?”

“Your neighbour Tientietnikov, your Excellency.”

Upon that the General frowned.

“Led me add,” put in Chichikov hastily, “that he greatly regrets that on a former occasion he should have failed to show a proper respect for—for—”

“For what?” asked the General.

“For the services to the public which your Excellency has rendered. Indeed, he cannot find words to express his sorrow, but keeps repeating to himself: ‘Would that I had valued at their true worth the men who have saved our fatherland!’”

“And why should he say that?” asked the mollified General. “I bear him no grudge. In fact, I have never cherished aught but a sincere liking for him, a sincere esteem, and do not doubt but that, in time, he may become a useful member of society.”

“In the words which you have been good enough to utter,” said Chichikov with a bow, “there is embodied much justice. Yes, Tientietnikov is in very truth a man of worth. Not only does he possess the gift of eloquence, but also he is a master of the pen.”

“Ah, yes; he DOES write rubbish of some sort, doesn't he? Verses, or something of the kind?”

“Not rubbish, your Excellency, but practical stuff. In short, he is inditing a history.”

“A HISTORY? But a history of what?”

“A history of, of—” For a moment or two Chichikov hesitated. Then, whether because it was a General that was seated in front of him, or because he desired to impart greater importance to the subject which he was about to invent, he concluded: “A history of Generals, your Excellency.”

“Of Generals? Of WHAT Generals?”

“Of Generals generally—of Generals at large. That is to say, and to be more precise, a history of the Generals of our fatherland.”

By this time Chichikov was floundering badly. Mentally he spat upon himself and reflected: “Gracious heavens! What rubbish I am talking!”

“Pardon me,” went on his interlocutor, “but I do not quite understand you. Is Tientietnikov producing a history of a given period, or only a history made up of a series of biographies? Also, is he including ALL our Generals, or only those who took part in the campaign of 1812?”

“The latter, your Excellency—only the Generals of 1812,” replied Chichikov. Then he added beneath his breath: “Were I to be killed for it, I could not say what that may be supposed to mean.”

“Then why should he not come and see me in person?” went on his host. “Possibly I might be able to furnish him with much interesting material?”

“He is afraid to come, your Excellency.”

“Nonsense! Just because of a hasty word or two! I am not that sort of man at all. In fact, I should be very happy to call upon HIM.”

“Never would he permit that, your Excellency. He would greatly prefer to be the first to make advances.” And Chichikov added to himself: “What a stroke of luck those Generals were! Otherwise, the Lord knows where my tongue might have landed me!”

At this moment the door into the adjoining room opened, and there appeared in the doorway a girl as fair as a ray of the sun—so fair, indeed, that Chichikov stared at her in amazement. Apparently she had come to speak to her father for a moment, but had stopped short on perceiving that there was some one with him. The only fault to be found in her appearance was the fact that she was too thin and fragile-looking.

“May I introduce you to my little pet?” said the General to Chichikov. “To tell you the truth, I do not know your name.”

“That you should be unacquainted with the name of one who has never distinguished himself in the manner of which you yourself can boast is scarcely to be wondered at.” And Chichikov executed one of his sidelong, deferential bows.

“Well, I should be delighted to know it.”

“It is Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, your Excellency.” With that went the easy bow of a military man and the agile backward movement of an indiarubber ball.

“Ulinka, this is Paul Ivanovitch,” said the General, turning to his daughter. “He has just told me some interesting news—namely, that our neighbour Tientietnikov is not altogether the fool we had at first thought him. On the contrary, he is engaged upon a very important work—upon a history of the Russian Generals of 1812.”

“But who ever supposed him to be a fool?” asked the girl quickly. “What happened was that you took Vishnepokromov's word—the word of a man who is himself both a fool and a good-for-nothing.”

“Well, well,” said the father after further good-natured dispute on the subject of Vishnepokromov. “Do you now run away, for I wish to dress for luncheon. And you, sir,” he added to Chichikov, “will you not join us at table?”

Chichikov bowed so low and so long that, by the time that his eyes had ceased to see nothing but his own boots, the General's daughter had disappeared, and in her place was standing a bewhiskered butler, armed with a silver soap-dish and a hand-basin.

“Do you mind if I wash in your presence?” asked the host.

“By no means,” replied Chichikov. “Pray do whatsoever you please in that respect.”

Upon that the General fell to scrubbing himself—incidentally, to sending soapsuds flying in every direction. Meanwhile he seemed so favourably disposed that Chichikov decided to sound him then and there, more especially since the butler had left the room.

“May I put to you a problem?” he asked.

“Certainly,” replied the General. “What is it?”

“It is this, your Excellency. I have a decrepit old uncle who owns three hundred souls and two thousand roubles-worth of other property. Also, except for myself, he possesses not a single heir. Now, although his infirm state of health will not permit of his managing his property in person, he will not allow me either to manage it. And the reason for his conduct—his very strange conduct—he states as follows: ‘I do not know my nephew, and very likely he is a spendthrift. If he wishes to show me that he is good for anything, let him go and acquire as many souls as I have acquired; and when he has done that I will transfer to him my three hundred souls as well.’”

“The man must be an absolute fool,” commented the General.

“Possibly. And were that all, things would not be as bad as they are. But, unfortunately, my uncle has gone and taken up with his housekeeper, and has had children by her. Consequently, everything will now pass to THEM.”

“The old man must have taken leave of his senses,” remarked the General. “Yet how I can help you I fail to see.”

“Well, I have thought of a plan. If you will hand me over all the dead souls on your estate—hand them over to me exactly as though they were still alive, and were purchasable property—I will offer them to the old man, and then he will leave me his fortune.”

At this point the General burst into a roar of laughter such as few can ever have heard. Half-dressed, he subsided into a chair, threw back his head, and guffawed until he came near to choking. In fact, the house shook with his merriment, so much so that the butler and his daughter came running into the room in alarm.

It was long before he could produce a single articulate word; and even when he did so (to reassure his daughter and the butler) he kept momentarily relapsing into spluttering chuckles which made the house ring and ring again.

Chichikov was greatly taken aback.

“Oh, that uncle!” bellowed the General in paroxysms of mirth. “Oh, that blessed uncle! WHAT a fool he'll look! Ha, ha, ha! Dead souls offered him instead of live ones! Oh, my goodness!”

“I suppose I've put my foot in it again,” ruefully reflected Chichikov. “But, good Lord, what a man the fellow is to laugh! Heaven send that he doesn't burst of it!”

“Ha, ha, ha!” broke out the General afresh. “WHAT a donkey the old man must be! To think of his saying to you: ‘You go and fit yourself out with three hundred souls, and I'll cap them with my own lot’! My word! What a jackass!”

“A jackass, your Excellency?”

“Yes, indeed! And to think of the jest of putting him off with dead souls! Ha, ha, ha! WHAT wouldn't I give to see you handing him the title deeds?”

“Who is he? What is he like? Is he very old?”

“He is eighty, your Excellency.”

“But still brisk and able to move about, eh? Surely he must be pretty strong to go on living with his housekeeper like that?”

“Yes. But what does such strength mean? Sand runs away, your Excellency.”

“The old fool! But is he really such a fool?”

“Yes, your Excellency.”

“And does he go out at all? Does he see company? Can he still hold himself upright?”

“Yes, but with great difficulty.”

“And has he any teeth left?”

“No more than two at the most.”

“The old jackass! Don't be angry with me, but I must say that, though your uncle, he is also a jackass.”

“Quite so, your Excellency. And though it grieves ME to have to confess that he is my uncle, what am I to do with him?”

Yet this was not altogether the truth. What would have been a far harder thing for Chichikov to have confessed was the fact that he possessed no uncles at all.

“I beg of you, your Excellency,” he went on, “to hand me over those, those—”

“Those dead souls, eh? Why, in return for the jest I will give you some land as well. Yes, you can take the whole graveyard if you like. Ha, ha, ha! The old man! Ha, ha, ha! WHAT a fool he'll look! Ha, ha, ha!”

And once more the General's guffaws went ringing through the house.

[At this point there is a long hiatus in the original.]





CHAPTER III


“If Colonel Koshkarev should turn out to be as mad as the last one it is a bad look-out,” said Chichikov to himself on opening his eyes amid fields and open country—everything else having disappeared save the vault of heaven and a couple of low-lying clouds.

“Selifan,” he went on, “did you ask how to get to Colonel Koshkarev's?”

“Yes, Paul Ivanovitch. At least, there was such a clatter around the koliaska that I could not; but Petrushka asked the coachman.”

“You fool! How often have I told you not to rely on Petrushka? Petrushka is a blockhead, an idiot. Besides, at the present moment I believe him to be drunk.”

“No, you are wrong, barin,” put in the person referred to, turning his head with a sidelong glance. “After we get down the next hill we shall need but to keep bending round it. That is all.”

“Yes, and I suppose you'll tell me that sivnkha is the only thing that has passed your lips? Well, the view at least is beautiful. In fact, when one has seen this place one may say that one has seen one of the beauty spots of Europe.” This said, Chichikov added to himself, smoothing his chin: “What a difference between the features of a civilised man of the world and those of a common lacquey!”

Meanwhile the koliaska quickened its pace, and Chichikov once more caught sight of Tientietnikov's aspen-studded meadows. Undulating gently on elastic springs, the vehicle cautiously descended the steep incline, and then proceeded past water-mills, rumbled over a bridge or two, and jolted easily along the rough-set road which traversed the flats. Not a molehill, not a mound jarred the spine. The vehicle was comfort itself.

Swiftly there flew by clumps of osiers, slender elder trees, and silver-leaved poplars, their branches brushing against Selifan and Petrushka, and at intervals depriving the valet of his cap. Each time that this happened, the sullen-faced servitor fell to cursing both the tree responsible for the occurrence and the landowner responsible for the tree being in existence; yet nothing would induce him thereafter either to tie on the cap or to steady it with his hand, so complete was his assurance that the accident would never be repeated. Soon to the foregoing trees there became added an occasional birch or spruce fir, while in the dense undergrowth around their roots could be seen the blue iris and the yellow wood-tulip. Gradually the forest grew darker, as though eventually the obscurity would become complete. Then through the trunks and the boughs there began to gleam points of light like glittering mirrors, and as the number of trees lessened, these points grew larger, until the travellers debouched upon the shore of a lake four versts or so in circumference, and having on its further margin the grey, scattered log huts of a peasant village. In the water a great commotion was in progress. In the first place, some twenty men, immersed to the knee, to the breast, or to the neck, were dragging a large fishing-net inshore, while, in the second place, there was entangled in the same, in addition to some fish, a stout man shaped precisely like a melon or a hogshead. Greatly excited, he was shouting at the top of his voice: “Let Kosma manage it, you lout of a Denis! Kosma, take the end of the rope from Denis! Don't bear so hard on it, Thoma Bolshoy! Go where Thoma Menshov is! Damn it, bring the net to land, will you!” From this it became clear that it was not on his own account that the stout man was worrying. Indeed, he had no need to do so, since his fat would in any case have prevented him from sinking. Yes, even if he had turned head over heels in an effort to dive, the water would persistently have borne him up; and the same if, say, a couple of men had jumped on his back—the only result would have been that he would have become a trifle deeper submerged, and forced to draw breath by spouting bubbles through his nose. No, the cause of his agitation was lest the net should break, and the fish escape: wherefore he was urging some additional peasants who were standing on the bank to lay hold of and to pull at, an extra rope or two.

“That must be the barin—Colonel Koshkarev,” said Selifan.

“Why?” asked Chichikov.

“Because, if you please, his skin is whiter than the rest, and he has the respectable paunch of a gentleman.”

Meanwhile good progress was being made with the hauling in of the barin; until, feeling the ground with his feet, he rose to an upright position, and at the same moment caught sight of the koliaska, with Chichikov seated therein, descending the declivity.

“Have you dined yet?” shouted the barin as, still entangled in the net, he approached the shore with a huge fish on his back. With one hand shading his eyes from the sun, and the other thrown backwards, he looked, in point of pose, like the Medici Venus emerging from her bath.

“No,” replied Chichikov, raising his cap, and executing a series of bows.

“Then thank God for that,” rejoined the gentleman.

“Why?” asked Chichikov with no little curiosity, and still holding his cap over his head.

“Because of THIS. Cast off the net, Thoma Menshov, and pick up that sturgeon for the gentleman to see. Go and help him, Telepen Kuzma.”

With that the peasants indicated picked up by the head what was a veritable monster of a fish. “Isn't it a beauty—a sturgeon fresh run from the river?” exclaimed the stout barin. “And now let us be off home. Coachman, you can take the lower road through the kitchen garden. Run, you lout of a Thoma Bolshoy, and open the gate for him. He will guide you to the house, and I myself shall be along presently.”

Thereupon the barelegged Thoma Bolshoy, clad in nothing but a shirt, ran ahead of the koliaska through the village, every hut of which had hanging in front of it a variety of nets, for the reason that every inhabitant of the place was a fisherman. Next, he opened a gate into a large vegetable enclosure, and thence the koliaska emerged into a square near a wooden church, with, showing beyond the latter, the roofs of the manorial homestead.

“A queer fellow, that Koshkarev!” said Chichikov to himself.

“Well, whatever I may be, at least I'm here,” said a voice by his side. Chichikov looked round, and perceived that, in the meanwhile, the barin had dressed himself and overtaken the carriage. With a pair of yellow trousers he was wearing a grass-green jacket, and his neck was as guiltless of a collar as Cupid's. Also, as he sat sideways in his drozhki, his bulk was such that he completely filled the vehicle. Chichikov was about to make some remark or another when the stout gentleman disappeared; and presently his drozhki reemerged into view at the spot where the fish had been drawn to land, and his voice could be heard reiterating exhortations to his serfs. Yet when Chichikov reached the verandah of the house he found, to his intense surprise, the stout gentleman waiting to welcome the visitor. How he had contrived to convey himself thither passed Chichikov's comprehension. Host and guest embraced three times, according to a bygone custom of Russia. Evidently the barin was one of the old school.

“I bring you,” said Chichikov, “a greeting from his Excellency.”

“From whom?”

“From your relative General Alexander Dmitrievitch.”

“Who is Alexander Dmitrievitch?”

“What? You do not know General Alexander Dmitrievitch Betrishev?” exclaimed Chichikov with a touch of surprise.

“No, I do not,” replied the gentleman.

Chichikov's surprise grew to absolute astonishment.

“How comes that about?” he ejaculated. “I hope that I have the honour of addressing Colonel Koshkarev?”

“Your hopes are vain. It is to my house, not to his, that you have come; and I am Peter Petrovitch Pietukh—yes, Peter Petrovitch Pietukh.”

Chichikov, dumbfounded, turned to Selifan and Petrushka.

“What do you mean?” he exclaimed. “I told you to drive to the house of Colonel Koshkarev, whereas you have brought me to that of Peter Petrovitch Pietukh.”

“All the same, your fellows have done quite right,” put in the gentleman referred to. “Do you” (this to Selifan and Petrushka) “go to the kitchen, where they will give you a glassful of vodka apiece. Then put up the horses, and be off to the servants' quarters.”

“I regret the mistake extremely,” said Chichikov.

“But it is not a mistake. When you have tried the dinner which I have in store for you, just see whether you think IT a mistake. Enter, I beg of you.” And, taking Chichikov by the arm, the host conducted him within, where they were met by a couple of youths.

“Let me introduce my two sons, home for their holidays from the Gymnasium ,” said Pietukh. “Nikolasha, come and entertain our good visitor, while you, Aleksasha, follow me.” And with that the host disappeared.

Chichikov turned to Nikolasha, whom he found to be a budding man about town, since at first he opened a conversation by stating that, as no good was to be derived from studying at a provincial institution, he and his brother desired to remove, rather, to St. Petersburg, the provinces not being worth living in.

“I quite understand,” Chichikov thought to himself. “The end of the chapter will be confectioners' assistants and the boulevards.”

“Tell me,” he added aloud, “how does your father's property at present stand?”

“It is all mortgaged,” put in the father himself as he re-entered the room. “Yes, it is all mortgaged, every bit of it.”

“What a pity!” thought Chichikov. “At this rate it will not be long before this man has no property at all left. I must hurry my departure.” Aloud he said with an air of sympathy: “That you have mortgaged the estate seems to me a matter of regret.”

“No, not at all,” replied Pietukh. “In fact, they tell me that it is a good thing to do, and that every one else is doing it. Why should I act differently from my neighbours? Moreover, I have had enough of living here, and should like to try Moscow—more especially since my sons are always begging me to give them a metropolitan education.”

“Oh, the fool, the fool!” reflected Chichikov. “He is for throwing up everything and making spendthrifts of his sons. Yet this is a nice property, and it is clear that the local peasants are doing well, and that the family, too, is comfortably off. On the other hand, as soon as ever these lads begin their education in restaurants and theatres, the devil will away with every stick of their substance. For my own part, I could desire nothing better than this quiet life in the country.”

“Let me guess what is in your mind,” said Pietukh.

“What, then?” asked Chichikov, rather taken aback.

“You are thinking to yourself: ‘That fool of a Pietukh has asked me to dinner, yet not a bite of dinner do I see.’ But wait a little. It will be ready presently, for it is being cooked as fast as a maiden who has had her hair cut off plaits herself a new set of tresses.”

“Here comes Platon Mikhalitch, father!” exclaimed Aleksasha, who had been peeping out of the window.

“Yes, and on a grey horse,” added his brother.

“Who is Platon Mikhalitch?” inquired Chichikov.

“A neighbour of ours, and an excellent fellow.”

The next moment Platon Mikhalitch himself entered the room, accompanied by a sporting dog named Yarb. He was a tall, handsome man, with extremely red hair. As for his companion, it was of the keen-muzzled species used for shooting.

“Have you dined yet?” asked the host.

“Yes,” replied Platon.

“Indeed? What do you mean by coming here to laugh at us all? Do I ever go to YOUR place after dinner?”

The newcomer smiled. “Well, if it can bring you any comfort,” he said, “let me tell you that I ate nothing at the meal, for I had no appetite.”

“But you should see what I have caught—what sort of a sturgeon fate has brought my way! Yes, and what crucians and carp!”

“Really it tires one to hear you. How come you always to be so cheerful?”

“And how come YOU always to be so gloomy?” retorted the host.

“How, you ask? Simply because I am so.”

“The truth is you don't eat enough. Try the plan of making a good dinner. Weariness of everything is a modern invention. Once upon a time one never heard of it.”

“Well, boast away, but have you yourself never been tired of things?”

“Never in my life. I do not so much as know whether I should find time to be tired. In the morning, when one awakes, the cook is waiting, and the dinner has to be ordered. Then one drinks one's morning tea, and then the bailiff arrives for HIS orders, and then there is fishing to be done, and then one's dinner has to be eaten. Next, before one has even had a chance to utter a snore, there enters once again the cook, and one has to order supper; and when she has departed, behold, back she comes with a request for the following day's dinner! What time does THAT leave one to be weary of things?”

Throughout this conversation, Chichikov had been taking stock of the newcomer, who astonished him with his good looks, his upright, picturesque figure, his appearance of fresh, unwasted youthfulness, and the boyish purity, innocence, and clarity of his features. Neither passion nor care nor aught of the nature of agitation or anxiety of mind had ventured to touch his unsullied face, or to lay a single wrinkle thereon. Yet the touch of life which those emotions might have imparted was wanting. The face was, as it were, dreaming, even though from time to time an ironical smile disturbed it.

“I, too, cannot understand,” remarked Chichikov, “how a man of your appearance can find things wearisome. Of course, if a man is hard pressed for money, or if he has enemies who are lying in wait for his life (as have certain folk of whom I know), well, then—”

“Believe me when I say,” interrupted the handsome guest, “that, for the sake of a diversion, I should be glad of ANY sort of an anxiety. Would that some enemy would conceive a grudge against me! But no one does so. Everything remains eternally dull.”

“But perhaps you lack a sufficiency of land or souls?”

“Not at all. I and my brother own ten thousand desiatins of land, and over a thousand souls.”

“Curious! I do not understand it. But perhaps the harvest has failed, or you have sickness about, and many of your male peasants have died of it?”

“On the contrary, everything is in splendid order, for my brother is the best of managers.”

“Then to find things wearisome!” exclaimed Chichikov. “It passes my comprehension.” And he shrugged his shoulders.

“Well, we will soon put weariness to flight,” interrupted the host. “Aleksasha, do you run helter-skelter to the kitchen, and there tell the cook to serve the fish pasties. Yes, and where have that gawk of an Emelian and that thief of an Antoshka got to? Why have they not handed round the zakuski?”

At this moment the door opened, and the “gawk” and the “thief” in question made their appearance with napkins and a tray—the latter bearing six decanters of variously-coloured beverages. These they placed upon the table, and then ringed them about with glasses and platefuls of every conceivable kind of appetiser. That done, the servants applied themselves to bringing in various comestibles under covers, through which could be heard the hissing of hot roast viands. In particular did the “gawk” and the “thief” work hard at their tasks. As a matter of fact, their appellations had been given them merely to spur them to greater activity, for, in general, the barin was no lover of abuse, but, rather, a kind-hearted man who, like most Russians, could not get on without a sharp word or two. That is to say, he needed them for his tongue as he need a glass of vodka for his digestion. What else could you expect? It was his nature to care for nothing mild.

To the zakuski succeeded the meal itself, and the host became a perfect glutton on his guests' behalf. Should he notice that a guest had taken but a single piece of a comestible, he added thereto another one, saying: “Without a mate, neither man nor bird can live in this world.” Should any one take two pieces, he added thereto a third, saying: “What is the good of the number 2? God loves a trinity.” Should any one take three pieces, he would say: “Where do you see a waggon with three wheels? Who builds a three-cornered hut?” Lastly, should any one take four pieces, he would cap them with a fifth, and add thereto the punning quip, “Na piat opiat ”. After devouring at least twelve steaks of sturgeon, Chichikov ventured to think to himself, “My host cannot possibly add to THEM,” but found that he was mistaken, for, without a word, Pietukh heaped upon his plate an enormous portion of spit-roasted veal, and also some kidneys. And what veal it was!

“That calf was fed two years on milk,” he explained. “I cared for it like my own son.”

“Nevertheless I can eat no more,” said Chichikov.

“Do you try the veal before you say that you can eat no more.”

“But I could not get it down my throat. There is no room left.”

“If there be no room in a church for a newcomer, the beadle is sent for, and room is very soon made—yes, even though before there was such a crush that an apple couldn't have been dropped between the people. Do you try the veal, I say. That piece is the titbit of all.”

So Chichikov made the attempt; and in very truth the veal was beyond all praise, and room was found for it, even though one would have supposed the feat impossible.

“Fancy this good fellow removing to St. Petersburg or Moscow!” said the guest to himself. “Why, with a scale of living like this, he would be ruined in three years.” For that matter, Pietukh might well have been ruined already, for hospitality can dissipate a fortune in three months as easily as it can in three years.

The host also dispensed the wine with a lavish hand, and what the guests did not drink he gave to his sons, who thus swallowed glass after glass. Indeed, even before coming to table, it was possible to discern to what department of human accomplishment their bent was turned. When the meal was over, however, the guests had no mind for further drinking. Indeed, it was all that they could do to drag themselves on to the balcony, and there to relapse into easy chairs. Indeed, the moment that the host subsided into his seat—it was large enough for four—he fell asleep, and his portly presence, converting itself into a sort of blacksmith's bellows, started to vent, through open mouth and distended nostrils, such sounds as can have greeted the reader's ear but seldom—sounds as of a drum being beaten in combination with the whistling of a flute and the strident howling of a dog.

“Listen to him!” said Platon.

Chichikov smiled.

“Naturally, on such dinners as that,” continued the other, “our host does NOT find the time dull. And as soon as dinner is ended there can ensue sleep.”

“Yes, but, pardon me, I still fail to understand why you should find life wearisome. There are so many resources against ennui!”

“As for instance?”

“For a young man, dancing, the playing of one or another musical instrument, and—well, yes, marriage.”

“Marriage to whom?”

“To some maiden who is both charming and rich. Are there none in these parts?”

“No.”

“Then, were I you, I should travel, and seek a maiden elsewhere.” And a brilliant idea therewith entered Chichikov's head. “This last resource,” he added, “is the best of all resources against ennui.”

“What resource are you speaking of?”

“Of travel.”

“But whither?”

“Well, should it so please you, you might join me as my companion.” This said, the speaker added to himself as he eyed Platon: “Yes, that would suit me exactly, for then I should have half my expenses paid, and could charge him also with the cost of mending the koliaska.”

“And whither should we go?”

“In that respect I am not wholly my own master, as I have business to do for others as well as for myself. For instance, General Betristchev—an intimate friend and, I might add, a generous benefactor of mine—has charged me with commissions to certain of his relatives. However, though relatives are relatives, I am travelling likewise on my own account, since I wish to see the world and the whirligig of humanity—which, in spite of what people may say, is as good as a living book or a second education.” As a matter of fact, Chichikov was reflecting, “Yes, the plan is an excellent one. I might even contrive that he should have to bear the whole of our expenses, and that his horses should be used while my own should be put out to graze on his farm.”

“Well, why should I not adopt the suggestion?” was Platon's thought. “There is nothing for me to do at home, since the management of the estate is in my brother's hands, and my going would cause him no inconvenience. Yes, why should I not do as Chichikov has suggested?”

Then he added aloud:

“Would you come and stay with my brother for a couple of days? Otherwise he might refuse me his consent.”

“With great pleasure,” said Chichikov. “Or even for three days.”

“Then here is my hand on it. Let us be off at once.” Platon seemed suddenly to have come to life again.

“Where are you off to?” put in their host unexpectedly as he roused himself and stared in astonishment at the pair. “No, no, my good sirs. I have had the wheels removed from your koliaska, Monsieur Chichikov, and have sent your horse, Platon Mikhalitch, to a grazing ground fifteen versts away. Consequently you must spend the night here, and depart to-morrow morning after breakfast.”

What could be done with a man like Pietukh? There was no help for it but to remain. In return, the guests were rewarded with a beautiful spring evening, for, to spend the time, the host organised a boating expedition on the river, and a dozen rowers, with a dozen pairs of oars, conveyed the party (to the accompaniment of song) across the smooth surface of the lake and up a great river with towering banks. From time to time the boat would pass under ropes, stretched across for purposes of fishing, and at each turn of the rippling current new vistas unfolded themselves as tier upon tier of woodland delighted the eye with a diversity of timber and foliage. In unison did the rowers ply their sculls, yet it was though of itself that the skiff shot forward, bird-like, over the glassy surface of the water; while at intervals the broad-shouldered young oarsman who was seated third from the bow would raise, as from a nightingale's throat, the opening staves of a boat song, and then be joined by five or six more, until the melody had come to pour forth in a volume as free and boundless as Russia herself. And Pietukh, too, would give himself a shake, and help lustily to support the chorus; and even Chichikov felt acutely conscious of the fact that he was a Russian. Only Platon reflected: “What is there so splendid in these melancholy songs? They do but increase one's depression of spirits.”

The journey homeward was made in the gathering dusk. Rhythmically the oars smote a surface which no longer reflected the sky, and darkness had fallen when they reached the shore, along which lights were twinkling where the fisherfolk were boiling live eels for soup. Everything had now wended its way homeward for the night; the cattle and poultry had been housed, and the herdsmen, standing at the gates of the village cattle-pens, amid the trailing dust lately raised by their charges, were awaiting the milk-pails and a summons to partake of the eel-broth. Through the dusk came the hum of humankind, and the barking of dogs in other and more distant villages; while, over all, the moon was rising, and the darkened countryside was beginning to glimmer to light again under her beams. What a glorious picture! Yet no one thought of admiring it. Instead of galloping over the countryside on frisky cobs, Nikolasha and Aleksasha were engaged in dreaming of Moscow, with its confectioners' shops and the theatres of which a cadet, newly arrived on a visit from the capital, had just been telling them; while their father had his mind full of how best to stuff his guests with yet more food, and Platon was given up to yawning. Only in Chichikov was a spice of animation visible. “Yes,” he reflected, “some day I, too, will become lord of such a country place.” And before his mind's eye there arose also a helpmeet and some little Chichikovs.

By the time that supper was finished the party had again over-eaten themselves, and when Chichikov entered the room allotted him for the night, he lay down upon the bed, and prodded his stomach. “It is as tight as a drum,” he said to himself. “Not another titbit of veal could now get into it.” Also, circumstances had so brought it about that next door to him there was situated his host's apartment; and since the intervening wall was thin, Chichikov could hear every word that was said there. At the present moment the master of the house was engaged in giving the cook orders for what, under the guise of an early breakfast, promised to constitute a veritable dinner. You should have heard Pietukh's behests! They would have excited the appetite of a corpse.

“Yes,” he said, sucking his lips, and drawing a deep breath, “in the first place, make a pasty in four divisions. Into one of the divisions put the sturgeon's cheeks and some viaziga , and into another division some buckwheat porridge, young mushrooms and onions, sweet milk, calves' brains, and anything else that you may find suitable—anything else that you may have got handy. Also, bake the pastry to a nice brown on one side, and but lightly on the other. Yes, and, as to the under side, bake it so that it will be all juicy and flaky, so that it shall not crumble into bits, but melt in the mouth like the softest snow that ever you heard of.” And as he said this Pietukh fairly smacked his lips.

“The devil take him!” muttered Chichikov, thrusting his head beneath the bedclothes to avoid hearing more. “The fellow won't give one a chance to sleep.”

Nevertheless he heard through the blankets:

“And garnish the sturgeon with beetroot, smelts, peppered mushrooms, young radishes, carrots, beans, and anything else you like, so as to have plenty of trimmings. Yes, and put a lump of ice into the pig's bladder, so as to swell it up.”

Many other dishes did Pietukh order, and nothing was to be heard but his talk of boiling, roasting, and stewing. Finally, just as mention was being made of a turkey cock, Chichikov fell asleep.

Next morning the guest's state of repletion had reached the point of Platon being unable to mount his horse; wherefore the latter was dispatched homeward with one of Pietukh's grooms, and the two guests entered Chichikov's koliaska. Even the dog trotted lazily in the rear; for he, too, had over-eaten himself.

“It has been rather too much of a good thing,” remarked Chichikov as the vehicle issued from the courtyard.

“Yes, and it vexes me to see the fellow never tire of it,” replied Platon.

“Ah,” thought Chichikov to himself, “if I had an income of seventy thousand roubles, as you have, I'd very soon give tiredness one in the eye! Take Murazov, the tax-farmer—he, again, must be worth ten millions. What a fortune!”

“Do you mind where we drive?” asked Platon. “I should like first to go and take leave of my sister and my brother-in-law.”

“With pleasure,” said Chichikov.

“My brother-in-law is the leading landowner hereabouts. At the present moment he is drawing an income of two hundred thousand roubles from a property which, eight years ago, was producing a bare twenty thousand.”

“Truly a man worthy of the utmost respect! I shall be most interested to make his acquaintance. To think of it! And what may his family name be?”

“Kostanzhoglo.”

“And his Christian name and patronymic?”

“Constantine Thedorovitch.”

“Constantine Thedorovitch Kostanzhoglo. Yes, it will be a most interesting event to make his acquaintance. To know such a man must be a whole education.”

Here Platon set himself to give Selifan some directions as to the way, a necessary proceeding in view of the fact that Selifan could hardly maintain his seat on the box. Twice Petrushka, too, had fallen headlong, and this necessitated being tied to his perch with a piece of rope. “What a clown!” had been Chichikov's only comment.

“This is where my brother-in-law's land begins,” said Platon.

“They give one a change of view.”

And, indeed, from this point the countryside became planted with timber; the rows of trees running as straight as pistol-shots, and having beyond them, and on higher ground, a second expanse of forest, newly planted like the first; while beyond it, again, loomed a third plantation of older trees. Next there succeeded a flat piece of the same nature.

“All this timber,” said Platon, “has grown up within eight or ten years at the most; whereas on another man's land it would have taken twenty to attain the same growth.”

“And how has your brother-in-law effected this?”

“You must ask him yourself. He is so excellent a husbandman that nothing ever fails with him. You see, he knows the soil, and also knows what ought to be planted beside what, and what kinds of timber are the best neighbourhood for grain. Again, everything on his estate is made to perform at least three or four different functions. For instance, he makes his timber not only serve as timber, but also serve as a provider of moisture and shade to a given stretch of land, and then as a fertiliser with its fallen leaves. Consequently, when everywhere else there is drought, he still has water, and when everywhere else there has been a failure of the harvest, on his lands it will have proved a success. But it is a pity that I know so little about it all as to be unable to explain to you his many expedients. Folk call him a wizard, for he produces so much. Nevertheless, personally I find what he does uninteresting.”

“Truly an astonishing fellow!” reflected Chichikov with a glance at his companion. “It is sad indeed to see a man so superficial as to be unable to explain matters of this kind.”

At length the manor appeared in sight—an establishment looking almost like a town, so numerous were the huts where they stood arranged in three tiers, crowned with three churches, and surrounded with huge ricks and barns. “Yes,” thought Chichikov to himself, “one can see what a jewel of a landowner lives here.” The huts in question were stoutly built and the intervening alleys well laid-out; while, wherever a waggon was visible, it looked serviceable and more or less new. Also, the local peasants bore an intelligent look on their faces, the cattle were of the best possible breed, and even the peasants' pigs belonged to the porcine aristocracy. Clearly there dwelt here peasants who, to quote the song, were accustomed to “pick up silver by the shovelful.” Nor were Englishified gardens and parterres and other conceits in evidence, but, on the contrary, there ran an open view from the manor house to the farm buildings and the workmen's cots, so that, after the old Russian fashion, the barin should be able to keep an eye upon all that was going on around him. For the same purpose, the mansion was topped with a tall lantern and a superstructure—a device designed, not for ornament, nor for a vantage-spot for the contemplation of the view, but for supervision of the labourers engaged in distant fields. Lastly, the brisk, active servants who received the visitors on the verandah were very different menials from the drunken Petrushka, even though they did not wear swallow-tailed coats, but only Cossack tchekmenu of blue homespun cloth.

The lady of the house also issued on to the verandah. With her face of the freshness of “blood and milk” and the brightness of God's daylight, she as nearly resembled Platon as one pea resembles another, save that, whereas he was languid, she was cheerful and full of talk.

“Good day, brother!” she cried. “How glad I am to see you! Constantine is not at home, but will be back presently.”

“Where is he?”

“Doing business in the village with a party of factors,” replied the lady as she conducted her guests to the drawing-room.

With no little curiosity did Chichikov gaze at the interior of the mansion inhabited by the man who received an annual income of two hundred thousand roubles; for he thought to discern therefrom the nature of its proprietor, even as from a shell one may deduce the species of oyster or snail which has been its tenant, and has left therein its impression. But no such conclusions were to be drawn. The rooms were simple, and even bare. Not a fresco nor a picture nor a bronze nor a flower nor a china what-not nor a book was there to be seen. In short, everything appeared to show that the proprietor of this abode spent the greater part of his time, not between four walls, but in the field, and that he thought out his plans, not in sybaritic fashion by the fireside, nor in an easy chair beside the stove, but on the spot where work was actually in progress—that, in a word, where those plans were conceived, there they were put into execution. Nor in these rooms could Chichikov detect the least trace of a feminine hand, beyond the fact that certain tables and chairs bore drying-boards whereon were arranged some sprinklings of flower petals.

“What is all this rubbish for?” asked Platon.

“It is not rubbish,” replied the lady of the house. “On the contrary, it is the best possible remedy for fever. Last year we cured every one of our sick peasants with it. Some of the petals I am going to make into an ointment, and some into an infusion. You may laugh as much as you like at my potting and preserving, yet you yourself will be glad of things of the kind when you set out on your travels.”

Platon moved to the piano, and began to pick out a note or two.

“Good Lord, what an ancient instrument!” he exclaimed. “Are you not ashamed of it, sister?”

“Well, the truth is that I get no time to practice my music. You see,” she added to Chichikov, “I have an eight-year-old daughter to educate; and to hand her over to a foreign governess in order that I may have leisure for my own piano-playing—well, that is a thing which I could never bring myself to do.”

“You have become a wearisome sort of person,” commented Platon, and walked away to the window. “Ah, here comes Constantine,” presently he added.

Chichikov also glanced out of the window, and saw approaching the verandah a brisk, swarthy-complexioned man of about forty, a man clad in a rough cloth jacket and a velveteen cap. Evidently he was one of those who care little for the niceties of dress. With him, bareheaded, there came a couple of men of a somewhat lower station in life, and all three were engaged in an animated discussion. One of the barin's two companions was a plain peasant, and the other (clad in a blue Siberian smock) a travelling factor. The fact that the party halted awhile by the entrance steps made it possible to overhear a portion of their conversation from within.

“This is what you peasants had better do,” the barin was saying. “Purchase your release from your present master. I will lend you the necessary money, and afterwards you can work for me.”

“No, Constantine Thedorovitch,” replied the peasant. “Why should we do that? Remove us just as we are. You will know how to arrange it, for a cleverer gentleman than you is nowhere to be found. The misfortune of us muzhiks is that we cannot protect ourselves properly. The tavern-keepers sell us such liquor that, before a man knows where he is, a glassful of it has eaten a hole through his stomach, and made him feel as though he could drink a pail of water. Yes, it knocks a man over before he can look around. Everywhere temptation lies in wait for the peasant, and he needs to be cunning if he is to get through the world at all. In fact, things seem to be contrived for nothing but to make us peasants lose our wits, even to the tobacco which they sell us. What are folk like ourselves to do, Constantine Thedorovitch? I tell you it is terribly difficult for a muzhik to look after himself.”

“Listen to me. This is how things are done here. When I take on a serf, I fit him out with a cow and a horse. On the other hand, I demand of him thereafter more than is demanded of a peasant anywhere else. That is to say, first and foremost I make him work. Whether a peasant be working for himself or for me, never do I let him waste time. I myself toil like a bullock, and I force my peasants to do the same, for experience has taught me that that is the only way to get through life. All the mischief in the world comes through lack of employment. Now, do you go and consider the matter, and talk it over with your mir .”

“We have done that already, Constantine Thedorovitch, and our elders' opinion is: ‘There is no need for further talk. Every peasant belonging to Constantine Thedorovitch is well off, and hasn't to work for nothing. The priests of his village, too, are men of good heart, whereas ours have been taken away, and there is no one to bury us.’”

“Nevertheless, do you go and talk the matter over again.”

“We will, barin.”

Here the factor who had been walking on the barin's other side put in a word.

“Constantine Thedorovitch,” he said, “I beg of you to do as I have requested.”

“I have told you before,” replied the barin, “that I do not care to play the huckster. I am not one of those landowners whom fellows of your sort visit on the very day that the interest on a mortgage is due. Ah, I know your fraternity thoroughly, and know that you keep lists of all who have mortgages to repay. But what is there so clever about that? Any man, if you pinch him sufficiently, will surrender you a mortgage at half-price,—any man, that is to say, except myself, who care nothing for your money. Were a loan of mine to remain out three years, I should never demand a kopeck of interest on it.”

“Quite so, Constantine Thedorovitch,” replied the factor. “But I am asking this of you more for the purpose of establishing us on a business footing than because I desire to win your favour. Prey, therefore, accept this earnest money of three thousand roubles.” And the man drew from his breast pocket a dirty roll of bank-notes, which, carelessly receiving, Kostanzhoglo thrust, uncounted, into the back pocket of his overcoat.

“Hm!” thought Chichikov. “For all he cares, the notes might have been a handkerchief.” When Kostanzhoglo appeared at closer quarters—that is to say, in the doorway of the drawing-room—he struck Chichikov more than ever with the swarthiness of his complexion, the dishevelment of his black, slightly grizzled locks, the alertness of his eye, and the impression of fiery southern origin which his whole personality diffused. For he was not wholly a Russian, nor could he himself say precisely who his forefathers had been. Yet, inasmuch as he accounted genealogical research no part of the science of estate-management, but a mere superfluity, he looked upon himself as, to all intents and purposes, a native of Russia, and the more so since the Russian language was the only tongue he knew.

Platon presented Chichikov, and the pair exchanged greetings.

“To get rid of my depression, Constantine,” continued Platon, “I am thinking of accompanying our guest on a tour through a few of the provinces.”

“An excellent idea,” said Kostanzhoglo. “But precisely whither?” he added, turning hospitably to Chichikov.

“To tell you the truth,” replied that personage with an affable inclination of the head as he smoothed the arm of his chair with his hand, “I am travelling less on my own affairs than on the affairs of others. That is to say, General Betristchev, an intimate friend, and, I might add, a generous benefactor, of mine, has charged me with commissions to some of his relatives. Nevertheless, though relatives are relatives, I may say that I am travelling on my own account as well, in that, in addition to possible benefit to my health, I desire to see the world and the whirligig of humanity, which constitute, so to speak, a living book, a second course of education.”

“Yes, there is no harm in looking at other corners of the world besides one's own.”

“You speak truly. There IS no harm in such a proceeding. Thereby one may see things which one has not before encountered, one may meet men with whom one has not before come in contact. And with some men of that kind a conversation is as precious a benefit as has been conferred upon me by the present occasion. I come to you, most worthy Constantine Thedorovitch, for instruction, and again for instruction, and beg of you to assuage my thirst with an exposition of the truth as it is. I hunger for the favour of your words as for manna.”

“But how so? What can I teach you?” exclaimed Kostanzhoglo in confusion. “I myself was given but the plainest of educations.”

“Nay, most worthy sir, you possess wisdom, and again wisdom. Wisdom only can direct the management of a great estate, that can derive a sound income from the same, that can acquire wealth of a real, not a fictitious, order while also fulfilling the duties of a citizen and thereby earning the respect of the Russian public. All this I pray you to teach me.”

“I tell you what,” said Kostanzhoglo, looking meditatively at his guest. “You had better stay with me for a few days, and during that time I can show you how things are managed here, and explain to you everything. Then you will see for yourself that no great wisdom is required for the purpose.”

“Yes, certainly you must stay here,” put in the lady of the house. Then, turning to her brother, she added: “And you too must stay. Why should you be in such a hurry?”

“Very well,” he replied. “But what say YOU, Paul Ivanovitch?”

“I say the same as you, and with much pleasure,” replied Chichikov. “But also I ought to tell you this: that there is a relative of General Betristchev's, a certain Colonel Koshkarev—”

“Yes, we know him; but he is quite mad.”

“As you say, he is mad, and I should not have been intending to visit him, were it not that General Betristchev is an intimate friend of mine, as well as, I might add, my most generous benefactor.”

“Then,” said Kostanzhoglo, “do you go and see Colonel Koshkarev NOW. He lives less than ten versts from here, and I have a gig already harnessed. Go to him at once, and return here for tea.”

“An excellent idea!” cried Chichikov, and with that he seized his cap.

Half an hour's drive sufficed to bring him to the Colonel's establishment. The village attached to the manor was in a state of utter confusion, since in every direction building and repairing operations were in progress, and the alleys were choked with heaps of lime, bricks, and beams of wood. Also, some of the huts were arranged to resemble offices, and superscribed in gilt letters “Depot for Agricultural Implements,” “Chief Office of Accounts,” “Estate Works Committee,” “Normal School for the Education of Colonists,” and so forth.

Chichikov found the Colonel posted behind a desk and holding a pen between his teeth. Without an instant's delay the master of the establishment—who seemed a kindly, approachable man, and accorded to his visitor a very civil welcome—plunged into a recital of the labour which it had cost him to bring the property to its present condition of affluence. Then he went on to lament the fact that he could not make his peasantry understand the incentives to labour which the riches of science and art provide; for instance, he had failed to induce his female serfs to wear corsets, whereas in Germany, where he had resided for fourteen years, every humble miller's daughter could play the piano. None the less, he said, he meant to peg away until every peasant on the estate should, as he walked behind the plough, indulge in a regular course of reading Franklin's Notes on Electricity, Virgil's Georgics, or some work on the chemical properties of soil.

“Good gracious!” mentally exclaimed Chichikov. “Why, I myself have not had time to finish that book by the Duchesse de la Vallière!”

Much else the Colonel said. In particular did he aver that, provided the Russian peasant could be induced to array himself in German costume, science would progress, trade increase, and the Golden Age dawn in Russia.

For a while Chichikov listened with distended eyes. Then he felt constrained to intimate that with all that he had nothing to do, seeing that his business was merely to acquire a few souls, and thereafter to have their purchase confirmed.

“If I understand you aright,” said the Colonel, “you wish to present a Statement of Plea?”

“Yes, that is so.”

“Then kindly put it into writing, and it shall be forwarded to the Office for the Reception of Reports and Returns. Thereafter that Office will consider it, and return it to me, who will, in turn, dispatch it to the Estate Works Committee, who will, in turn, revise it, and present it to the Administrator, who, jointly with the Secretary, will—”

“Pardon me,” expostulated Chichikov, “but that procedure will take up a great deal of time. Why need I put the matter into writing at all? It is simply this. I want a few souls which are—well, which are, so to speak, dead.”

“Very good,” commented the Colonel. “Do you write down in your Statement of Plea that the souls which you desire are, ‘so to speak, dead.’”

“But what would be the use of my doing so? Though the souls are dead, my purpose requires that they should be represented as alive.”

“Very good,” again commented the Colonel. “Do you write down in your Statement that ‘it is necessary’ (or, should you prefer an alternative phrase, ‘it is requested,’ or ‘it is desiderated,’ or ‘it is prayed,’) ‘that the souls be represented as alive.’ At all events, WITHOUT documentary process of that kind, the matter cannot possibly be carried through. Also, I will appoint a Commissioner to guide you round the various Offices.”

And he sounded a bell; whereupon there presented himself a man whom, addressing as “Secretary,” the Colonel instructed to summon the “Commissioner.” The latter, on appearing, was seen to have the air, half of a peasant, half of an official.

“This man,” the Colonel said to Chichikov, “will act as your escort.”

What could be done with a lunatic like Koshkarev? In the end, curiosity moved Chichikov to accompany the Commissioner. The Committee for the Reception of Reports and Returns was discovered to have put up its shutters, and to have locked its doors, for the reason that the Director of the Committee had been transferred to the newly-formed Committee of Estate Management, and his successor had been annexed by the same Committee. Next, Chichikov and his escort rapped at the doors of the Department of Estate Affairs; but that Department's quarters happened to be in a state of repair, and no one could be made to answer the summons save a drunken peasant from whom not a word of sense was to be extracted. At length the escort felt himself removed to remark:

“There is a deal of foolishness going on here. Fellows like that drunkard lead the barin by the nose, and everything is ruled by the Committee of Management, which takes men from their proper work, and sets them to do any other it likes. Indeed, only through the Committee does ANYTHING get done.”

By this time Chichikov felt that he had seen enough; wherefore he returned to the Colonel, and informed him that the Office for the Reception of Reports and Returns had ceased to exist. At once the Colonel flamed to noble rage. Pressing Chichikov's hand in token of gratitude for the information which the guest had furnished, he took paper and pen, and noted eight searching questions under three separate headings: “Why has the Committee of Management presumed to issue orders to officials not under its jurisdiction?” “Why has the Chief Manager permitted his predecessor, though still in retention of his post, to follow him to another Department?” and “Why has the Committee of Estate Affairs suffered the Office for the Reception of Reports and Returns to lapse?”

“Now for a row!” thought Chichikov to himself, and turned to depart; but his host stopped him, saying:

“I cannot let you go, for, in addition to my honour having become involved, it behoves me to show my people how the regular, the organised, administration of an estate may be conducted. Herewith I will hand over the conduct of your affair to a man who is worth all the rest of the staff put together, and has had a university education. Also, the better to lose no time, may I humbly beg you to step into my library, where you will find notebooks, paper, pens, and everything else that you may require. Of these articles pray make full use, for you are a gentleman of letters, and it is your and my joint duty to bring enlightenment to all.”

So saying, he ushered his guest into a large room lined from floor to ceiling with books and stuffed specimens. The books in question were divided into sections—a section on forestry, a section on cattle-breeding, a section on the raising of swine, and a section on horticulture, together with special journals of the type circulated merely for the purposes of reference, and not for general reading. Perceiving that these works were scarcely of a kind calculated to while away an idle hour, Chichikov turned to a second bookcase. But to do so was to fall out of the frying-pan into the fire, for the contents of the second bookcase proved to be works on philosophy, while, in particular, six huge volumes confronted him under a label inscribed “A Preparatory Course to the Province of Thought, with the Theory of Community of Effort, Co-operation, and Subsistence, in its Application to a Right Understanding of the Organic Principles of a Mutual Division of Social Productivity.” Indeed, wheresoever Chichikov looked, every page presented to his vision some such words as “phenomenon,” “development,” “abstract,” “contents,” and “synopsis.” “This is not the sort of thing for me,” he murmured, and turned his attention to a third bookcase, which contained books on the Arts. Extracting a huge tome in which some by no means reticent mythological illustrations were contained, he set himself to examine these pictures. They were of the kind which pleases mostly middle-aged bachelors and old men who are accustomed to seek in the ballet and similar frivolities a further spur to their waning passions. Having concluded his examination, Chichikov had just extracted another volume of the same species when Colonel Koshkarev returned with a document of some sort and a radiant countenance.

“Everything has been carried through in due form!” he cried. “The man whom I mentioned is a genius indeed, and I intend not only to promote him over the rest, but also to create for him a special Department. Herewith shall you hear what a splendid intellect is his, and how in a few minutes he has put the whole affair in order.”

“May the Lord be thanked for that!” thought Chichikov. Then he settled himself while the Colonel read aloud:

“After giving full consideration to the Reference which your Excellency has entrusted to me, I have the honour to report as follows:”

“‘In the Statement of Plea presented by one Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov, Gentleman, Chevalier, and Collegiate Councillor, there lurks an error, in that an oversight has led the Petitioner to apply to Revisional Souls the term “Dead.” Now, from the context it would appear that by this term the Petitioner desires to signify Souls Approaching Death rather than Souls Actually Deceased: wherefore the term employed betrays such an empirical instruction in letters as must, beyond doubt, have been confined to the Village School, seeing that in truth the Soul is Deathless.’”

“The rascal!” Koshkarev broke off to exclaim delightedly. “He has got you there, Monsieur Chichikov. And you will admit that he has a sufficiently incisive pen?”

“On this Estate there exist no Unmortgaged Souls whatsoever, whether Approaching Death or Otherwise; for the reason that all Souls thereon have been pledged not only under a First Deed of Mortgage, but also (for the sum of One Hundred and Fifty Roubles per Soul) under a Second,—the village of Gurmailovka alone excepted, in that, in consequence of a Suit having been brought against Landowner Priadistchev, and of a caveat having been pronounced by the Land Court, and of such caveat having been published in No. 42 of the Gazette of Moscow, the said Village has come within the Jurisdiction of the Court Above-Mentioned.”

“Why did you not tell me all this before?” cried Chichikov furiously. “Why you have kept me dancing about for nothing?”

“Because it was absolutely necessary that you should view the matter through forms of documentary process. This is no jest on my part. The inexperienced may see things subconsciously, yet is imperative that he should also see them CONSCIOUSLY.”

But to Chichikov's patience an end had come. Seizing his cap, and casting all ceremony to the winds, he fled from the house, and rushed through the courtyard. As it happened, the man who had driven him thither had, warned by experience, not troubled even to take out the horses, since he knew that such a proceeding would have entailed not only the presentation of a Statement of Plea for fodder, but also a delay of twenty-four hours until the Resolution granting the same should have been passed. Nevertheless the Colonel pursued his guest to the gates, and pressed his hand warmly as he thanked him for having enabled him (the Colonel) thus to exhibit in operation the proper management of an estate. Also, he begged to state that, under the circumstances, it was absolutely necessary to keep things moving and circulating, since, otherwise, slackness was apt to supervene, and the working of the machine to grow rusty and feeble; but that, in spite of all, the present occasion had inspired him with a happy idea—namely, the idea of instituting a Committee which should be entitled “The Committee of Supervision of the Committee of Management,” and which should have for its function the detection of backsliders among the body first mentioned.

It was late when, tired and dissatisfied, Chichikov regained Kostanzhoglo's mansion. Indeed, the candles had long been lit.

“What has delayed you?” asked the master of the house as Chichikov entered the drawing-room.

“Yes, what has kept you and the Colonel so long in conversation together?” added Platon.

“This—the fact that never in my life have I come across such an imbecile,” was Chichikov's reply.

“Never mind,” said Kostanzhoglo. “Koshkarev is a most reassuring phenomenon. He is necessary in that in him we see expressed in caricature all the more crying follies of our intellectuals—of the intellectuals who, without first troubling to make themselves acquainted with their own country, borrow silliness from abroad. Yet that is how certain of our landowners are now carrying on. They have set up ‘offices’ and factories and schools and ‘commissions,’ and the devil knows what else besides. A fine lot of wiseacres! After the French War in 1812 they had to reconstruct their affairs: and see how they have done it! Yet so much worse have they done it than a Frenchman would have done that any fool of a Peter Petrovitch Pietukh now ranks as a good landowner!”

“But he has mortgaged the whole of his estate?” remarked Chichikov.

“Yes, nowadays everything is being mortgaged, or is going to be.” This said, Kostanzhoglo's temper rose still further. “Out upon your factories of hats and candles!” he cried. “Out upon procuring candle-makers from London, and then turning landowners into hucksters! To think of a Russian pomiestchik , a member of the noblest of callings, conducting workshops and cotton mills! Why, it is for the wenches of towns to handle looms for muslin and lace.”

“But you yourself maintain workshops?” remarked Platon.

“I do; but who established them? They established themselves. For instance, wool had accumulated, and since I had nowhere to store it, I began to weave it into cloth—but, mark you, only into good, plain cloth of which I can dispose at a cheap rate in the local markets, and which is needed by peasants, including my own. Again, for six years on end did the fish factories keep dumping their offal on my bank of the river; wherefore, at last, as there was nothing to be done with it, I took to boiling it into glue, and cleared forty thousand roubles by the process.”

“The devil!” thought Chichikov to himself as he stared at his host. “What a fist this man has for making money!”

“Another reason why I started those factories,” continued Kostanzhoglo, “is that they might give employment to many peasants who would otherwise have starved. You see, the year happened to have been a lean one—thanks to those same industry-mongering landowners, in that they had neglected to sow their crops; and now my factories keep growing at the rate of a factory a year, owing to the circumstance that such quantities of remnants and cuttings become so accumulated that, if a man looks carefully to his management, he will find every sort of rubbish to be capable of bringing in a return—yes, to the point of his having to reject money on the plea that he has no need of it. Yet I do not find that to do all this I require to build a mansion with facades and pillars!”

“Marvellous!” exclaimed Chichikov. “Beyond all things does it surprise me that refuse can be so utilised.”

“Yes, and that is what can be done by SIMPLE methods. But nowadays every one is a mechanic, and wants to open that money chest with an instrument instead of simply. For that purpose he hies him to England. Yes, THAT is the thing to do. What folly!” Kostanzhoglo spat and added: “Yet when he returns from abroad he is a hundred times more ignorant than when he went.”

“Ah, Constantine,” put in his wife anxiously, “you know how bad for you it is to talk like this.”

“Yes, but how am I to help losing my temper? The thing touches me too closely, it vexes me too deeply to think that the Russian character should be degenerating. For in that character there has dawned a sort of Quixotism which never used to be there. Yes, no sooner does a man get a little education into his head than he becomes a Don Quixote, and establishes schools on his estate such as even a madman would never have dreamed of. And from that school there issues a workman who is good for nothing, whether in the country or in the town—a fellow who drinks and is for ever standing on his dignity. Yet still our landowners keep taking to philanthropy, to converting themselves into philanthropic knights-errant, and spending millions upon senseless hospitals and institutions, and so ruining themselves and turning their families adrift. Yes, that is all that comes of philanthropy.”

Chichikov's business had nothing to do with the spread of enlightenment, he was but seeking an opportunity to inquire further concerning the putting of refuse to lucrative uses; but Kostanzhoglo would not let him get a word in edgeways, so irresistibly did the flow of sarcastic comment pour from the speaker's lips.

“Yes,” went on Kostanzhoglo, “folk are always scheming to educate the peasant. But first make him well-off and a good farmer. THEN he will educate himself fast enough. As things are now, the world has grown stupid to a degree that passes belief. Look at the stuff our present-day scribblers write! Let any sort of a book be published, and at once you will see every one making a rush for it. Similarly will you find folk saying: ‘The peasant leads an over-simple life. He ought to be familiarised with luxuries, and so led to yearn for things above his station.’ And the result of such luxuries will be that the peasant will become a rag rather than a man, and suffer from the devil only knows what diseases, until there will remain in the land not a boy of eighteen who will not have experienced the whole gamut of them, and found himself left with not a tooth in his jaws or a hair on his pate. Yes, that is what will come of infecting the peasant with such rubbish. But, thank God, there is still one healthy class left to us—a class which has never taken up with the ‘advantages’ of which I speak. For that we ought to be grateful. And since, even yet, the Russian agriculturist remains the most respect-worthy man in the land, why should he be touched? Would to God every one were an agriculturist!”

“Then you believe agriculture to be the most profitable of occupations?” said Chichikov.

“The best, at all events—if not the most profitable. ‘In the sweat of thy brow shalt thou till the land.’ To quote that requires no great wisdom, for the experience of ages has shown us that, in the agricultural calling, man has ever remained more moral, more pure, more noble than in any other. Of course I do not mean to imply that no other calling ought to be practised: simply that the calling in question lies at the root of all the rest. However much factories may be established privately or by the law, there will still lie ready to man's hand all that he needs—he will still require none of those amenities which are sapping the vitality of our present-day folk, nor any of those industrial establishments which make their profit, and keep themselves going, by causing foolish measures to be adopted which, in the end, are bound to deprave and corrupt our unfortunate masses. I myself am determined never to establish any manufacture, however profitable, which will give rise to a demand for ‘higher things,’ such as sugar and tobacco—no not if I lose a million by my refusing to do so. If corruption MUST overtake the MIR, it shall not be through my hands. And I think that God will justify me in my resolve. Twenty years have I lived among the common folk, and I know what will inevitably come of such things.”

“But what surprises me most,” persisted Chichikov, “is that from refuse it should be possible, with good management, to make such an immensity of profit.”

“And as for political economy,” continued Kostanzhoglo, without noticing him, and with his face charged with bilious sarcasm, “—as for political economy, it is a fine thing indeed. Just one fool sitting on another fool's back, and flogging him along, even though the rider can see no further than his own nose! Yet into the saddle will that fool climb—spectacles and all! Oh, the folly, the folly of such things!” And the speaker spat derisively.

“That may be true,” said his wife. “Yet you must not get angry about it. Surely one can speak on such subjects without losing one's temper?”

“As I listen to you, most worthy Constantine Thedorovitch,” Chichikov hastened to remark, “it becomes plain to me that you have penetrated into the meaning of life, and laid your finger upon the essential root of the matter. Yet supposing, for a moment, we leave the affairs of humanity in general, and turn our attention to a purely individual affair, might I ask you how, in the case of a man becoming a landowner, and having a mind to grow wealthy as quickly as possible (in order that he may fulfil his bounden obligations as a citizen), he can best set about it?”

“How he can best set about growing wealthy?” repeated Kostanzhoglo. “Why,—”

“Let us go to supper,” interrupted the lady of the house, rising from her chair, and moving towards the centre of the room, where she wrapped her shivering young form in a shawl. Chichikov sprang up with the alacrity of a military man, offered her his arm, and escorted her, as on parade, to the dining-room, where awaiting them there was the soup-toureen. From it the lid had just been removed, and the room was redolent of the fragrant odour of early spring roots and herbs. The company took their seats, and at once the servants placed the remainder of the dishes (under covers) upon the table and withdrew, for Kostanzhoglo hated to have servants listening to their employers' conversation, and objected still more to their staring at him all the while that he was eating.

When the soup had been consumed, and glasses of an excellent vintage resembling Hungarian wine had been poured out, Chichikov said to his host:

“Most worthy sir, allow me once more to direct your attention to the subject of which we were speaking at the point when the conversation became interrupted. You will remember that I was asking you how best a man can set about, proceed in, the matter of growing...”

[Here from the original two pages are missing.]

... “A property for which, had he asked forty thousand, I should still have demanded a reduction.”

“Hm!” thought Chichikov; then added aloud: “But why do you not purchase it yourself?”

“Because to everything there must be assigned a limit. Already my property keeps me sufficiently employed. Moreover, I should cause our local dvoriane to begin crying out in chorus that I am exploiting their extremities, their ruined position, for the purpose of acquiring land for under its value. Of that I am weary.”

“How readily folk speak evil!” exclaimed Chichikov.

“Yes, and the amount of evil-speaking in our province surpasses belief. Never will you hear my name mentioned without my being called also a miser and a usurer of the worst possible sort; whereas my accusers justify themselves in everything, and say that, ‘though we have wasted our money, we have started a demand for the higher amenities of life, and therefore encouraged industry with our wastefulness, a far better way of doing things than that practised by Kostanzhoglo, who lives like a pig.’”

“Would I could live in your ‘piggish’ fashion!” ejaculated Chichikov.

“And so forth, and so forth. Yet what are the ‘higher amenities of life’? What good can they do to any one? Even if a landowner of the day sets up a library, he never looks at a single book in it, but soon relapses into cardplaying—the usual pursuit. Yet folk call me names simply because I do not waste my means upon the giving of dinners! One reason why I do not give such dinners is that they weary me; and another reason is that I am not used to them. But come you to my house for the purpose of taking pot luck, and I shall be delighted to see you. Also, folk foolishly say that I lend money on interest; whereas the truth is that if you should come to me when you are really in need, and should explain to me openly how you propose to employ my money, and I should perceive that you are purposing to use that money wisely, and that you are really likely to profit thereby—well, in that case you would find me ready to lend you all that you might ask without interest at all.”

“That is a thing which it is well to know,” reflected Chichikov.

“Yes,” repeated Kostanzhoglo, “under those circumstances I should never refuse you my assistance. But I do object to throwing my money to the winds. Pardon me for expressing myself so plainly. To think of lending money to a man who is merely devising a dinner for his mistress, or planning to furnish his house like a lunatic, or thinking of taking his paramour to a masked ball or a jubilee in honour of some one who had better never have been born!”

And, spitting, he came near to venting some expression which would scarcely have been becoming in the presence of his wife. Over his face the dark shadow of hypochondria had cast a cloud, and furrows had formed on his brow and temples, and his every gesture bespoke the influence of a hot, nervous rancour.

“But allow me once more to direct your attention to the subject of our recently interrupted conversation,” persisted Chichikov as he sipped a glass of excellent raspberry wine. “That is to say, supposing I were to acquire the property which you have been good enough to bring to my notice, how long would it take me to grow rich?”

“That would depend on yourself,” replied Kostanzhoglo with grim abruptness and evident ill-humour. “You might either grow rich quickly or you might never grow rich at all. If you made up your mind to grow rich, sooner or later you would find yourself a wealthy man.”

“Indeed?” ejaculated Chichikov.

“Yes,” replied Kostanzhoglo, as sharply as though he were angry with Chichikov. “You would merely need to be fond of work: otherwise you would effect nothing. The main thing is to like looking after your property. Believe me, you would never grow weary of doing so. People would have it that life in the country is dull; whereas, if I were to spend a single day as it is spent by some folk, with their stupid clubs and their restaurants and their theatres, I should die of ennui. The fools, the idiots, the generations of blind dullards! But a landowner never finds the days wearisome—he has not the time. In his life not a moment remains unoccupied; it is full to the brim. And with it all goes an endless variety of occupations. And what occupations! Occupations which genuinely uplift the soul, seeing that the landowner walks with nature and the seasons of the year, and takes part in, and is intimate with, everything which is evolved by creation. For let us look at the round of the year's labours. Even before spring has arrived there will have begun a general watching and a waiting for it, and a preparing for sowing, and an apportioning of crops, and a measuring of seed grain by byres, and drying of seed, and a dividing of the workers into teams. For everything needs to be examined beforehand, and calculations must be made at the very start. And as soon as ever the ice shall have melted, and the rivers be flowing, and the land have dried sufficiently to be workable, the spade will begin its task in kitchen and flower garden, and the plough and the harrow their tasks in the field; until everywhere there will be tilling and sowing and planting. And do you understand what the sum of that labour will mean? It will mean that the harvest is being sown, that the welfare of the world is being sown, that the food of millions is being put into the earth. And thereafter will come summer, the season of reaping, endless reaping; for suddenly the crops will have ripened, and rye-sheaf will be lying heaped upon rye-sheaf, with, elsewhere, stocks of barley, and of oats, and of wheat. And everything will be teeming with life, and not a moment will there need to be lost, seeing that, had you even twenty eyes, you would have need for them all. And after the harvest festivities there will be grain to be carted to byre or stacked in ricks, and stores to be prepared for the winter, and storehouses and kilns and cattle-sheds to be cleaned for the same purpose, and the women to be assigned their tasks, and the totals of everything to be calculated, so that one may see the value of what has been done. And lastly will come winter, when in every threshing-floor the flail will be working, and the grain, when threshed, will need to be carried from barn to binn, and the mills require to be seen to, and the estate factories to be inspected, and the workmen's huts to be visited for the purpose of ascertaining how the muzhik is faring (for, given a carpenter who is clever with his tools, I, for one, am only too glad to spend an hour or two in his company, so cheering to me is labour). And if, in addition, one discerns the end to which everything is moving, and the manner in which the things of earth are everywhere multiplying and multiplying, and bringing forth more and more fruit to one's profiting, I cannot adequately express what takes place in a man's soul. And that, not because of the growth in his wealth—money is money and no more—but because he will feel that everything is the work of his own hands, and that he has been the cause of everything, and its creator, and that from him, as from a magician, there has flowed bounty and goodness for all. In what other calling will you find such delights in prospect?” As he spoke, Kostanzhoglo raised his face, and it became clear that the wrinkles had fled from it, and that, like the Tsar on the solemn day of his crowning, Kostanzhoglo's whole form was diffusing light, and his features had in them a gentle radiance. “In all the world,” he repeated, “you will find no joys like these, for herein man imitates the God who projected creation as the supreme happiness, and now demands of man that he, too, should act as the creator of prosperity. Yet there are folk who call such functions tedious!”

Kostanzhoglo's mellifluous periods fell upon Chichikov's ear like the notes of a bird of paradise. From time to time he gulped, and his softened eyes expressed the pleasure which it gave him to listen.

“Constantine, it is time to leave the table,” said the lady of the house, rising from her seat. Every one followed her example, and Chichikov once again acted as his hostess's escort—although with less dexterity of deportment than before, owing to the fact that this time his thoughts were occupied with more essential matters of procedure.

“In spite of what you say,” remarked Platon as he walked behind the pair, “I, for my part, find these things wearisome.”

But the master of the house paid no attention to his remark, for he was reflecting that his guest was no fool, but a man of serious thought and speech who did not take things lightly. And, with the thought, Kostanzhoglo grew lighter in soul, as though he had warmed himself with his own words, and were exulting in the fact that he had found some one capable of listening to good advice.

When they had settled themselves in the cosy, candle-lighted drawing-room, with its balcony and the glass door opening out into the garden—a door through which the stars could be seen glittering amid the slumbering tops of the trees—Chichikov felt more comfortable than he had done for many a day past. It was as though, after long journeying, his own rooftree had received him once more—had received him when his quest had been accomplished, when all that he wished for had been gained, when his travelling-staff had been laid aside with the words “It is finished.” And of this seductive frame of mind the true source had been the eloquent discourse of his hospitable host. Yes, for every man there exist certain things which, instantly that they are said, seem to touch him more closely, more intimately, than anything has done before. Nor is it an uncommon occurrence that in the most unexpected fashion, and in the most retired of retreats, one will suddenly come face to face with a man whose burning periods will lead one to forget oneself and the tracklessness of the route and the discomfort of one's nightly halting-places, and the futility of crazes and the falseness of tricks by which one human being deceives another. And at once there will become engraven upon one's memory—vividly, and for all time—the evening thus spent. And of that evening one's remembrance will hold true, both as to who was present, and where each such person sat, and what he or she was wearing, and what the walls and the stove and other trifling features of the room looked like.

In the same way did Chichikov note each detail that evening—both the appointments of the agreeable, but not luxuriously furnished, room, and the good-humoured expression which reigned on the face of the thoughtful host, and the design of the curtains, and the amber-mounted pipe smoked by Platon, and the way in which he kept puffing smoke into the fat jowl of the dog Yarb, and the sneeze which, on each such occasion, Yarb vented, and the laughter of the pleasant-faced hostess (though always followed by the words “Pray do not tease him any more”) and the cheerful candle-light, and the cricket chirping in a corner, and the glass door, and the spring night which, laying its elbows upon the tree-tops, and spangled with stars, and vocal with the nightingales which were pouring forth warbled ditties from the recesses of the foliage, kept glancing through the door, and regarding the company within.

“How it delights me to hear your words, good Constantine Thedorovitch!” said Chichikov. “Indeed, nowhere in Russia have I met with a man of equal intellect.”

Kostanzhoglo smiled, while realising that the compliment was scarcely deserved.

“If you want a man of GENUINE intellect,” he said, “I can tell you of one. He is a man whose boot soles are worth more than my whole body.”

“Who may he be?” asked Chichikov in astonishment.

“Murazov, our local Commissioner of Taxes.”

“Ah! I have heard of him before,” remarked Chichikov.

“He is a man who, were he not the director of an estate, might well be a director of the Empire. And were the Empire under my direction, I should at once appoint him my Minister of Finance.”

“I have heard tales beyond belief concerning him—for instance, that he has acquired ten million roubles.”

“Ten? More than forty. Soon half Russia will be in his hands.”

“You don't say so?” cried Chichikov in amazement.

“Yes, certainly. The man who has only a hundred thousand roubles to work with grows rich but slowly, whereas he who has millions at his disposal can operate over a greater radius, and so back whatsoever he undertakes with twice or thrice the money which can be brought against him. Consequently his field becomes so spacious that he ends by having no rivals. Yes, no one can compete with him, and, whatsoever price he may fix for a given commodity, at that price it will have to remain, nor will any man be able to outbid it.”

“My God!” muttered Chichikov, crossing himself, and staring at Kostanzhoglo with his breath catching in his throat. “The mind cannot grasp it—it petrifies one's thoughts with awe. You see folk marvelling at what Science has achieved in the matter of investigating the habits of cowbugs, but to me it is a far more marvellous thing that in the hands of a single mortal there can become accumulated such gigantic sums of money. But may I ask whether the great fortune of which you speak has been acquired through honest means?”

“Yes; through means of the most irreproachable kind—through the most honourable of methods.”

“Yet so improbable does it seem that I can scarcely believe it. Thousands I could understand, but millions—!”

“On the contrary, to make thousands honestly is a far more difficult matter than to make millions. Millions are easily come by, for a millionaire has no need to resort to crooked ways; the way lies straight before him, and he needs but to annex whatsoever he comes across. No rival will spring up to oppose him, for no rival will be sufficiently strong, and since the millionaire can operate over an extensive radius, he can bring (as I have said) two or three roubles to bear upon any one else's one. Consequently, what interest will he derive from a thousand roubles? Why, ten or twenty per cent. at the least.”

“And it is beyond measure marvellous that the whole should have started from a single kopeck.”

“Had it started otherwise, the thing could never have been done at all. Such is the normal course. He who is born with thousands, and is brought up to thousands, will never acquire a single kopeck more, for he will have been set up with the amenities of life in advance, and so never come to stand in need of anything. It is necessary to begin from the beginning rather than from the middle; from a kopeck rather than from a rouble; from the bottom rather than from the top. For only thus will a man get to know the men and conditions among which his career will have to be carved. That is to say, through encountering the rough and the tumble of life, and through learning that every kopeck has to be beaten out with a three-kopeck nail, and through worsting knave after knave, he will acquire such a degree of perspicuity and wariness that he will err in nothing which he may tackle, and never come to ruin. Believe me, it is so. The beginning, and not the middle, is the right starting point. No one who comes to me and says, ‘Give me a hundred thousand roubles, and I will grow rich in no time,’ do I believe, for he is likely to meet with failure rather than with the success of which he is so assured. 'Tis with a kopeck, and with a kopeck only, that a man must begin.”

“If that is so, I shall grow rich,” said Chichikov, involuntarily remembering the dead souls. “For of a surety I began with nothing.”

“Constantine, pray allow Paul Ivanovitch to retire to rest,” put in the lady of the house. “It is high time, and I am sure you have talked enough.”

“Yes, beyond a doubt you will grow rich,” continued Kostanzhoglo, without heeding his wife. “For towards you there will run rivers and rivers of gold, until you will not know what to do with all your gains.”

As though spellbound, Chichikov sat in an aureate world of ever-growing dreams and fantasies. All his thoughts were in a whirl, and on a carpet of future wealth his tumultuous imagination was weaving golden patterns, while ever in his ears were ringing the words, “towards you there will run rivers and rivers of gold.”

“Really, Constantine, DO allow Paul Ivanovitch to go to bed.”

“What on earth is the matter?” retorted the master of the household testily. “Pray go yourself if you wish to.” Then he stopped short, for the snoring of Platon was filling the whole room, and also—outrivalling it—that of the dog Yarb. This caused Kostanzhoglo to realise that bedtime really had arrived; wherefore, after he had shaken Platon out of his slumbers, and bidden Chichikov good night, all dispersed to their several chambers, and became plunged in sleep.

All, that is to say, except Chichikov, whose thoughts remained wakeful, and who kept wondering and wondering how best he could become the owner, not of a fictitious, but of a real, estate. The conversation with his host had made everything clear, had made the possibility of his acquiring riches manifest, had made the difficult art of estate management at once easy and understandable; until it would seem as though particularly was his nature adapted for mastering the art in question. All that he would need to do would be to mortgage the dead souls, and then to set up a genuine establishment. Already he saw himself acting and administering as Kostanzhoglo had advised him—energetically, and through personal oversight, and undertaking nothing new until the old had been thoroughly learned, and viewing everything with his own eyes, and making himself familiar with each member of his peasantry, and abjuring all superfluities, and giving himself up to hard work and husbandry. Yes, already could he taste the pleasure which would be his when he had built up a complete industrial organisation, and the springs of the industrial machine were in vigorous working order, and each had become able to reinforce the other. Labour should be kept in active operation, and, even as, in a mill, flour comes flowing from grain, so should cash, and yet more cash, come flowing from every atom of refuse and remnant. And all the while he could see before him the landowner who was one of the leading men in Russia, and for whom he had conceived such an unbounded respect. Hitherto only for rank or for opulence had Chichikov respected a man—never for mere intellectual power; but now he made a first exception in favour of Kostanzhoglo, seeing that he felt that nothing undertaken by his host could possibly come to naught. And another project which was occupying Chichikov's mind was the project of purchasing the estate of a certain landowner named Khlobuev. Already Chichikov had at his disposal ten thousand roubles, and a further fifteen thousand he would try and borrow of Kostanzhoglo (seeing that the latter had himself said that he was prepared to help any one who really desired to grow rich); while, as for the remainder, he would either raise the sum by mortgaging the estate or force Khlobuev to wait for it—just to tell him to resort to the courts if such might be his pleasure.

Long did our hero ponder the scheme; until at length the slumber which had, these four hours past, been holding the rest of the household in its embraces enfolded also Chichikov, and he sank into oblivion.
