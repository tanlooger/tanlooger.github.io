作者序


近来，这个世界简直充满了小说和浪漫传奇，以至于个人的故事很难被人们当真，尤其这个故事还要将其中人物的姓名和所处的环境隐去，因此，读者对接下来的内容抱持什么态度，我们只能随其所愿。

可以认为，作者在这里书写的是她自身的历史，在叙述的一开始，就交代了她为什么觉得需要隐藏她的姓名，对此无须再赘言。

当然，这个故事的原貌有所改变，我们使用了新的语言，其中所述那位知名女子的风格也发生了一些变化，特别是她叙述自己的故事的语言变得比原本版本更加朴实，最初的稿件中所用的语言更接近新门监狱的人所用之语，而她在之后似乎变得悔悟和谦卑，这是原来的语言所没有的。

为了讲好她的故事，使之如现在这般呈现在诸位面前，其中所费心思可算良多，对其进行修饰，使之语言便于阅读。当一个女人在年轻的时候放荡，而且本身便是放荡和邪恶的产物，到了讲述自己所有邪恶过往，尤其是要谈及她缘何时机和环境而开始了过去六十年生涯的时候，作者必然需要费尽一番心思，才能将其包装得清白无辜，不使其对自己产生不利，尤其是在面对充满恶意的读者的时候。

无论如何，作者已经殚精竭虑，避免文字让人产生下流的想法，在新的叙述形式下不让人觉得自大；至少是对她叙述中最糟糕的部分是花了如此心思。为了实现这个目标，她经历中的一些恶行并没有如实讲述，有些被删掉了，还有很多被缩减了。而如今留下来的希望不会冒犯到最纯真、最端庄的读者。最糟糕的故事也能有其益处，给读者的训诫希望读者能认真思考，尽管也可能对读者产生其他方面的影响。要讲述这段令人后悔的邪恶生活经历，必然要求邪恶部分尽可能真实，从而使幡然悔悟的部分显得美好，而这悔悟的过程，如果拥有相当的激情和生命力的话，必然是最好、最出彩的部分。

据说，讲述忏悔部分无法与讲述犯罪部分拥有相同的生命力、光彩和美好。如果这种说法正确的话，那也容许我在此声明，不同人有不同的阅读品位和偏好，因而实际上，差别并非在于读物本身的真正价值，更多是在于读者的情绪和爱好。

但是，本书主要推荐给那些懂得如何阅读的人，那些知道该从这个故事中领悟什么意义的读者——故事本身字里行间均透露深意。所以，我希望，这样的读者在阅读的时候，能够更多体悟道德上的训诫，而不限于虚构的情节；能够理解其中的深意，而不限于故事中的人物关系；能够体会作者行文的最终目的，而不限于所写人物的生活故事。

这个故事当中有大量有趣的小插曲，都被用于书中。在叙述的过程中，有技巧地进行了一些恰当的转变，以便自然地给读者一些启迪。她最初一段在科尔切斯特与那位年轻绅士之间的放荡生活，其中有许多揭露犯罪的良好契机，告诫那些环境与之相似的人，类似事情会遭遇的恶果，以及两方之间那些愚蠢的、无脑的、令人憎恶的行为。而她对于这些愚蠢而邪恶的行为所做出的生动描述也得到了回报。

她的情人在巴斯的悔悟，以及他如何因抛弃她而承受着疾病带来的正义的警告；即便是最亲密的朋友之间合法的亲密关系，也受到了正义的警告；在没有神的庇佑的情况下，要坚持维护美德的庄严决心有多么难以实现——对于具有正确判断力的人来说，以上这些内容，会比故事当中贯穿的色情线索更具有真正的美。

总之，整个故事都很谨慎地改变了其中所有的轻率放荡，整个故事在极度的细心作用下，都有启迪美德和信仰之用。任何人，若指责这个故事，指责我们出版此书的目的，都必然会感到不公的内疚。

在所有时代，那些提倡舞台艺术的人都据理力争，说服人们他们的戏剧具有益处，应该被最文明最虔诚的政府接纳；实际上，他们是在说，他们出于道德目的，采用最生动的表现形式，他们必然会倡导美德和慷慨的原则，揭露并遏制种种邪恶腐败的行为；如果他们真能如此，并且始终坚持这个原则作为检查他们在剧场中的表演的标准，那么他们的行为应该得到大力赞赏。

尽管本书内容涉及多方面，但这一基本原则是被严格遵守的。在书中，任何一处恶行，都或早或晚地有了不幸的命运，出现在其中的任何一个罪大恶极的恶棍，都得到了惩罚，书中提及的所有恶行都受到了谴责，而所有正义公正之事都受到赞扬。对于那些有诸多正当理由反对的事情——诸如不好的朋友、放荡的语言等——的叙述，除了这一准则还能给出更合适的回答吗？

正是基于这个原因，建议读者将本书当作一部从任何一部分都能获得益处、得出正义与信仰的结论的著作，一部若是愿意利用便能得到启示的著作。

这位知名女士所有损害他人的行为，都为诚实之人提出了良多警告，提示他们无辜之人如何被拉入绝境，遭遇偷盗劫掠，从而提示他们该如何避免。她抢劫了一个无辜的小孩——那孩子被虚荣的母亲打扮得漂漂亮亮，去上舞蹈学校——这能够给人们一个很好的提醒。她从公园当中一位年轻女士身旁偷窃金表的事情也具有类似作用。

她在圣约翰街的马车旁从一个轻率的荡妇手中弄到一个包裹，她在炉火边以及哈里奇得到赃物，这些全都给我们很好的提醒，提醒我们要更加专心以应对各种意外。

最后，她决意和被流放的配偶一起到弗吉尼亚，去过一种朴素的生活，勤劳持家，这段故事，对于所有无论是因为流放还是其他灾难而被迫去海外重建人生的不幸之人，都具有丰富的教育意义，让他们知道勤勉自有回报，即便是在这个世界上最荒凉的角落；让他们知道任何情形都不要如此卑下、可鄙或是丧失希望，只要坚持不懈，勤勤恳恳，就会得到解脱，会令最低微的生命重新立于世界，令其获得新生。

这便是我们在本书中涉及的一些严肃的推断，而这也正是将本书推荐给全世界、将本书出版的正当而充分的理由。

还有两段非常好的故事，在本书中有所谈及，但是都太长了没有办法完全展现出来，实际上，我觉得，这两段故事都可以独立成书。其中之一是她所谓的“女教师”的生活。此人在一些年中，经历丰富，做过淑女、妓女和老鸨，做过接生婆，也做过人们称为接生婆总管的角色，做过当铺老板娘、保姆，做过贼的庇护者，收过赃物，总之，此人本身也是一个贼，一个培养贼的人，但最终也是一个悔过之人。

第二个故事是关于她被流放的丈夫的。这是一个拦路抢劫的强盗，在路上横行作恶十二年之久，最后自愿成为流放者，其当时的身份并非罪犯，他的一生也充满了不可思议的经历。

但是正如我所说，这些故事太长了，没有办法在本书中讲述，而且我也没有办法保证把这些故事单独写成书。

当然，我们没有办法说这个故事讲到了知名的摩尔·弗兰德斯（她这么称呼自己）的生命的尽头，因为没有任何人能够把自己的故事写完，除非他们在自己死后还能书写。而由其他人所写的她丈夫的故事，则对于他们二人都做了详尽的描述，其中提及了他们在那个国家的生活，以及八年后发达了的他们如何重归英国，她在英国又生活了很久，活到高寿，但她并不如当初那般怀着特别的忏悔，似乎她总是厌恶提及自己之前的生活，无论是哪一部分。

在她在马里兰和弗吉尼亚生活的最后阶段，其中有许多令人愉快的事情，这令她的这段生活非常惬意，但是这部分故事却没有她自己讲述的内容的那种优雅，所以我们还是不提为妙。

因为新门[1]和老牢[2]这两个监狱的簿册里都有我的真实姓名，那里好些还未解决的重要案件都与我个人过去的行为有关系，所以在这本书里我不能说出我的真名和家世。也许我死后，大家会知道得详细些。现在还不是明说的时候，就是有个大赦令下来，甚至于不论何人、不分罪名的大赦，我仍然不敢交代清楚。

有几个穷凶极恶的伙伴（他们现在没法来害我了，因为他们都已经从绞刑架上走出这个世界，我从前也总以为自己会走那条路）只知道我叫摩尔·弗兰德斯，那么就让我在自述时也用这个名字吧。你们知道这些也就够了，等我将来敢明说的时候，再来仔细谈我的真名和家世吧。

我听说我们一个邻国——不知道是法国，还是别的国家——那里，皇帝下过一道命令，规定当罪人判处死刑，或者罚做摇橹奴隶，或者流放远方的时候，他们所有的孩子都归国家管教。因为这些罪人的财产被官府没收了，多半不会有钱来抚育他们的子女，所以政府就把这样的孩子放在孤儿院里，衣食全由国家供给，将他们抚养大。成人的时候，叫他们出去从事各种行业，干各样的职务，这样他们便能有个正当的职业，可以靠着自己的劳力谋生。

若是我们国家也采取了这种办法，我小时候也不至于那么孤苦茕独了。我在世界上没有一个朋友，没有衣服穿，得不到一点帮助，也没人肯来帮助我，因此不仅受过许多痛苦，而且当我还不能明白自己的处境以及怎样去想法补救的时候，已经被人们带得下流了。那种生活不仅可耻，而且很容易使我的灵魂和肉体同归于尽。

但是我们国家却有它的办法。我母亲因为犯了一件不值一提的偷窃案——从齐普赛街第一个布店里随便拿去三块上好的荷兰布——就被判了大罪。当时的情形说来话长，我也不去重述了。关于这件事，许多人的叙述各自不同，我简直不知道哪个是对的。

不管那件事情的真实经过如何，有一点人们的叙述是一致的，就是我母亲说她身上有孕，请求暂缓执行。经过验明的确有身孕以后，法庭允许将处刑日期暂缓七个月。七个月以后，法庭叫她去受从前判定的死刑，她又请求宽恩，最后办到减轻处分，只把她流放到殖民地去。她离开我时，我只有半岁，而且照顾我的人，你们当然知道，也不是什么好东西。

那时我生下来还没有多久，当然什么也记不得，关于那时候的事情，我也只是听人说的。因为我是在这样不幸的一个所在里出世，小的时候，也没有哪个教区来抚养我。我到底怎么能够活着，我自己也不知道。只听过人们说，我母亲的一个亲戚把我领去，养育了一些时候，至于由谁出钱，是谁的主意，我完全不知道。

我所能够记得，或者说我自己所知道的最早的事情，是我跟着一帮所谓吉卜赛人或者埃及人游荡。但是我和他们一定没有相处多久，因为我的皮肤并没有染上颜色，而他们带着走的小孩子总是染上颜色的。至于我起先怎样会和他们结伴，后来又怎样与他们分开，我自己也不记得了。

那是在厄色克斯的一个小城叫作科尔切斯特，他们离开了我。我好像记得是我离开了他们（我自己躲起来，不愿意再和他们一起游荡），但是这些零星细节，我是没有法子说得清楚的。我仅记得科尔切斯特教区的人员碰到我，就把我带走，我告诉他们我是和吉卜赛人一起来到这里的，但是不愿意再和他们一起游荡，所以他们就把我丢在这里。他们现在到什么地方，我当然是不知道的；这些人虽然派人四处调查，还是没有找到他们的行踪。

现在有人来抚育我了。虽然城里并没有一个教区照法律应当供给我的费用，但是人们知道我的情形，知道我年纪太小，那时我还不到三岁，不能够工作，城里的官吏动了恻隐之心，吩咐人们好好地照应我，所以我就变成那里的人，仿佛是生长在那里的一样。是一个当时很穷，从前却过过好日子的妇人，她就靠着抚养我们这种小孩，得到一些工钱。她天天替我们做好日常必需的一切，一直等到我们成人，能够出去做事，自己谋生。

这个妇人自己还开有一个小小的学校，教孩子们认字做工。因为她从前也是上等社会中人，所以很会培养小孩，而且非常细心。

但是最值得我们赞美的是：第一，她使孩子对于宗教真有热忱，因为她自己也是位虔敬诚实的妇人；第二，她培养孩子长大很会管家，很爱干净；第三，他们有非常好的礼貌同品行。所以我们只是吃得差，穿得粗，住的房子简陋，在别的方面我们的教育却同千金小姐一样讲究。

我在那里一直住到八岁，忽然得到一个可怕的消息，听说治安官（我想他们是这样称呼的）下了命令，要我出去服侍人家。然而无论到什么地方，我实在不能够做多少事，我所能够做的只是替人跑跑腿，或者做庖妇手下的苦力。他们常常这样告诉我，真把我吓坏了，因为我对他们所谓伺候人家这件事的确是感到极大的厌恶，虽然我的年纪那时还很小。我对我的阿妈说，我相信只要她肯答应，我一定能够想法维持自己的生活，不用出去服役，因为她曾经教给我做针线、打毛活，这是那城市的大宗生意。我告诉她，只要她肯收留我，我愿意替她做工，替她好好地做工。

我几乎每天都对她说，我愿意尽我的力量替她做工。总之，我整天不外乎做工和啼哭，这位仁慈的老妇人看见我这个样子，非常难过，结果弄得她替我担心，因为她真是爱我的。

有一天她走到我们这些可怜的小孩做工的房里，特意坐在我的对面，并不像往常一样来指导大家，却像是来观察我，看我怎样工作。我正在干一件她吩咐我做的事情。我记得是量画几件衬衣料子，这是人家请她缝的。一会儿她对我说：“你这傻孩子，你老是哭（因为那时候我正在哭）。我问你，为什么这么心酸？”

我说：“因为他们要叫我到别的地方去，当一个仆人，我的确不能够做多少事。”

她说：“不要紧，孩子，你虽然不能够做家务，慢慢可以学会，他们开头一定不至于让你干很麻烦的事情。”

我说：“不，他们要叫我做很苦的事，我干不了，他们就会打我，女仆们也要打我，逼我做难做的事，我还是个小孩子，实在没有法子做好。”说着我又哭起来了，所以不能再说什么了。

这些话感动了我那位慈母般的阿妈，她就决定先不让我出去服役。她叫我不要哭，说要去和市长先生商量，等我年纪大些，再派我出去服役。

但是，这不能够使我满意，一想起迟早总得出去服侍人家，我就觉得非常害怕，就是她答应要等到二十岁才叫我出去当仆人，我心中还是一样难过，一定还会天天哭，害怕最后总免不了听人调度。

她看我还没有平静，开始对我生气了。“你还要怎么样呢？”她说，“我不是告诉过你，要等到你大些，才叫你出去吗？”

“是的，”我说，“但是我最后还免不了要去当仆人的。”

“怎么，”她说，“这个孩子疯了吗？那么，你想做个贵妇人吗？”

“是的。”我说，任情地哭着，最后又大声号啕起来。

这句话倒把这位老婆婆逗笑了，这是可以想到的。

“好，太太，”她含讥带讽地对我说，“你要变作一位贵妇人，但是你怎么变呢？靠你的十指，你要变作一个贵妇人吗？”

“是的。”我很天真地答道。

“你能够赚多少？”她说，“你一天的工作可以挣多少钱呢？”

“我纺一天纱，可以挣三便士。要是缝普通衣服，一天有四便士。”我说。

“唉！可怜的贵妇人，”她又说，一面大笑，“这对你有什么用？”

“这就够养活我自己了，”我说，“只要你肯让我和你住在一起。”说这两句话的时候，我的声调是那么可怜，那种苦苦哀求的样子，老妇人听了，心中觉得对我特别依恋起来，这是她后来告诉我的。

“可是，”她说，“这些只够养活你，并不会有钱剩下来给你添置衣服。那么，这位小小贵妇人的衣服要谁替她买呢？”她说话时，总是对我微笑。

“那么我可以加倍地努力工作，”我说，“我所挣来的钱全给你。”

“可怜的孩子！那还不够养活你自己，”她说，“那一点钱几乎连供给你的伙食还不够呢。”

“那么我就不吃东西了，”我又很天真地说，“我只求你让我跟你在一块儿。”

“怎么，你能够不吃东西活着吗？”她说。

“可以的。”我答道，完全露出小孩子的神气，一面仍然任性地哭着。

在这些谈话里，我并没有一点耍手段的心思，你们一看就明白这完全是自然流露的话。但是话里含着那么多的天真和热情，把这位母亲般慈爱的老阿妈也弄哭了。她哭得同我一样厉害，牵着我的手，带我走出教室。

“来，”她说，“我不要你出去服侍人家了，你就同我住着吧。”这样我才放心。

后来她去拜访市长，谈到我的事情，我那位好阿妈就把我所说的一切告诉他。他听得高兴，叫他的太太和两位小姐都来听，自然她们都觉得非常好笑。

可是还没有过一个礼拜，市长太太和她的两个小姐忽然来看我阿妈，看看她的学堂和孩子。她们参观了一会儿，市长太太问我的阿妈：“夫人，请你告诉我哪位小姑娘想做贵妇人？”我听到她的话，害怕得了不得，虽然我自己也不知道是什么缘故。市长太太走到我面前，说：“姑娘，你做什么活计？”

姑娘这个词在我们学堂里几乎是从来没有听见过的，我心里暗自纳闷她这样称呼我，不知道含了什么歹意。我站起来，对她行个屈膝礼，她把我手里的活计拿起看了一下，说做得很好，又拉起我的一只手看看说：“依我看，她或者会成个贵妇人。我告诉你，她的手长得像个贵妇人。”这使我非常高兴。但是市长太太不仅说了甜蜜的话，还从口袋里拿出一个先令给我，吩咐我好好做工，跟着人家学做女红，在她看来我非常可能变作一位贵妇人。

其实，我那位老阿妈，市长太太还有其他的人们全误解了我，因为“贵妇人”这个词，她们用起来是一种意思，在我心里又是一种意思。唉！我以为一个能够自食其力，养活自己，不要出去服役的人就可以说是一位贵妇人。她们的意思却是贵族奢华的生活和其他许多我不懂得的事情。

市长太太走后，她的两位小姐进来，她们也要找这位“贵妇人”。她们和我谈了好久，我总是那样天真地回答她们。但是每次她们问我是不是决心要做个贵妇人，我总是说，“是”。后来一位小姐问我怎样才能算贵妇人。这么一问，倒把我弄糊涂了。最后我用反面的话来解释，我说，一个贵妇人是不出去服役的，不到人家那里当仆人的。她们很高兴，我对她们说了好多孩子话，她们也很爱听。她们大概很喜欢我，也给了我一些钱。

这些钱，我全交给我的阿妈，对她说等我将来做贵妇人的时候，得来的钱也全归她。从我这次的谈话和其他时候的谈话里，我这位老师渐渐了解了我所谓的贵妇人是什么意思，知道在我心目中的贵妇人就是一个能够靠着自己的工作养活自己的人，她最后还问我这是不是我的意思。

我说：“不错。”我还坚持说能够这样自给就可以算是一位贵妇人。“我们这里不是有一位，”我讲出一个修补花边和洗贵妇人们所戴的花帽的女人的名字，“她的确是位贵妇人，人们也都叫她太太。”

“可怜的孩子，”我的老阿妈说，“你要变作这样一个贵妇人，那是很容易的事，她是一个不名誉的女人，已经有了两三个私生子了。”

我不懂她的意思，但是我答道，我知道人们都叫她太太，她又没有出去服役，替人家管家事，所以我总说她是位贵妇人，我想做这样一个贵妇人。

自然我这几句话又传到太太小姐的耳朵里，她们听了很开心，那两位年轻姑娘——市长先生的小姐——时常来看我，问我的阿妈那位小贵妇在哪间房里，这件事使我觉得很骄傲。这三位太太小姐常常来看我，有时她们还带着别人同来，所以全城差不多都晓得“小贵妇”是我的外号。

我现在快到十岁了，看起来有些大人神气，因为我的态度总是非常严肃，礼貌也很周到。我还听见贵妇们常说，我长得漂亮，将来还要美貌，听到这些话，自然很有些骄傲。但是，这种骄傲那时对我还没有什么坏影响。她们常给我钱，我就交给老阿妈，她的确是个诚实的女人，待我公平极了，把我给她的钱全花在我身上，替我买帽子，衣服，手套等等。所以我老是穿得整整齐齐的，老是顶干净的，因为我最爱清洁，即使穿了破烂的衣服，也要干干净净的，不然我自己也会把它放到水里去洗。我的好阿妈很诚实地将人家给我的钱花在我身上，总要告诉那些贵妇人这件东西或者那套衣服是用她们的钱买的，她们听到了，常常又给我钱，直到后来有一天治安官真的叫我出外去服侍人家。但是那时候我已经是个能干的女工，贵妇们待我又那么好，所以我深深懂得我可以不去，因为我把挣来的钱交给我的阿妈，足够养活我的了。我的阿妈因此就告诉他们，如果他们肯答应，她要请这位贵妇人（她是这样叫我的）做她的助手，教导小孩子们，这件事我可以干得很好，因为我做活很巧，虽然我的年纪还不大。

但是城里贵妇人们的恩德还不仅如此。她们听说我不像从前那样由公家供给，就更经常给我钱。我长大后，她们叫我替她们做许多工作，像缝衣服，补花边，做帽子等等，她们不只给我工钱，还教我怎样做，所以我这时真是个我所理想的贵妇人了，因为那时我还不到十二岁，除了购置衣服和付给我阿妈生活费之外，我袋里还常常有余钱。

贵妇人们还常把她们自己或者孩子们的衣服给我。袜子，裙子，长袍等等，这些东西我的老阿妈像母亲一样替我料理，好好地保存着，叫我一件一件修补改制过，穿起来挺好看，她那一副管家的本领真是罕见！

后来有一位贵妇人非常喜欢我，一定要我到她家里去，她说，要她的女儿和我同住一个月。

这虽然是她的一番好意，但是我的老阿妈对她说，除非是她决定永久留我在她家里，这次长期的邀请对于这小贵妇人是害多益少的。

“这也是真的，”那位贵妇人说，“那么我只要她先在我家里住一个星期，看看我的女儿同她能不能够合得来，看看她的脾气好不好，然后我再告诉你以后怎么办。假使有谁像从前那样来看她，你对她们说你已经把她送到我这里来了。”

这种办法也可说是谨慎极了，我就到这位贵妇人家里去。但是我很喜欢那两位姑娘，她们也很喜欢我，所以当我回来的时候，我是依依不舍的，她们也是同样地惜别。

然而，我还是和她们分别了，回来跟我这位诚实的老妇人又同住了一年。我现在很能够帮她的忙，因为我已经十四岁了。按我的年纪可以说我长得很高，看起来很有点大人的样子，但是我在那位贵妇人家里学会了享受舒适的生活，回到旧地方，就不像从前那样安心，心想能够当一个真正的贵妇人的确很不错，我现在对于贵妇人这几个字已经有了和以前大不相同的理解。我既然认为做个贵妇人是很好的事，就也爱和贵妇人们住在一起，所以总想能够再到那里去。

当我十四岁三个月的时候，我那位慈爱的老阿妈——我应当叫她母亲——病死了。我那时的境况实在可怜。当穷人们被送进坟墓的时候，解散他们的家庭是很容易的事，所以这位贫苦的好妇人安葬之后，她所管的教区里的孤儿立刻由教区执事送到别处去抚养。她办的学校也关了门，学校里孩子们没有事干，只好待在家里，等着把他们送到别的地方去。至于她所留下的东西，她的女儿，一个结了婚的妇人，立刻全部拿走，搬运东西的时候，他们只是和我开玩笑，说这位小贵妇如果高兴，现在可以自立门户了。

我几乎吓傻了，不知道怎么办好，因为我好似被人赶到门外，走到茫茫的世界里。更坏的是，我有二十二个先令在这诚实的老妇人手里，这就是这小贵妇在世界上全部的财产。当我向她的女儿索要的时候，她还骂我，说这件事与她毫不相关。

那位贤良的穷妇人的确告诉过她的女儿，说这笔钱放在什么地方，是那个孩子的钱，她还有一两回叫我去，要亲手交还我，但是不幸得很，我都刚好不在那里。我回来的时候，她已经快死了，不能够讲这件事了。但是她的女儿到底还老实，后来把钱给了我，虽然起先对我很残忍。

我现在真是个可怜的贵妇人了，当天晚上我就得离开那里，到茫茫的世界里去，因为她的女儿把东西全搬走了，我连个住宿的地方也没有，一块面包也吃不到。好像有几个邻居得知了我的情况，动了恻隐之心，跑去通知我在她家里住过的那位贵妇人。她立刻打发仆人来接我，我就带了我所有的东西，跟她们去了，心里自然是很快活的。起先那种可怕的情况在我心中留下很深的印象，我现在已经不想当什么贵妇人了，甘心做一个仆人，随便她们让我当哪种仆人。

但是我这位慷慨的新主人在任何方面都比我从前那位贤良妇人强，财产自然也比她多，不过说起诚实，她是赶不上我的老阿妈的，因为虽然这位贵妇人也是非常公平的，可是无论在什么时候我都不应该忘记说，我的阿妈不管多么穷，她是世界上一个再诚实不过的女人。

这位慈爱的贵妇人刚刚把我带走，城里的第一位贵妇人——那位市长太太就叫她的两个女儿来照顾我。还有一家，是我当小贵妇的时候留心过我的，现在也来找我到她们家里去。所以真可以说她们都在捧我，而且得不到我的都很生气，特别是市长太太，她以为她的朋友把我抢去了。她说照道理我应当是她的，因为她是第一个注意到我的人。可是已经得到我的那家却不肯放我走。至于我自己，待在我现在所住的那家已经再好不过了。

我在那家住到十七岁出头，凡是良好的教育，我全受到。那位贵妇人聘有几位教师到家里教她女儿跳舞，说法文，写文章，还请人来教她们音乐。我老是同她们在一起，自然学得也同她们一样快。虽然那些先生并不是为我请的，可是二位小姐由教导所得来的，我却靠着模仿同询问也学会了。总之，我像她们一样能够跳舞，说法文，而且我唱得比她们好，因为我的乐感比她俩都强得多。弹大键琴或者竖琴，我的进步没有那么快，因为我自己没有乐器可以练习，只得当她们不弹的空儿，借她们的用一用，但是我学得还不错，后来二位小姐又买了两件乐器（一把大键琴，一把竖琴），她们自己就教我弹。至于跳舞，她们不得不叫我学对舞，因为她们总是要我来凑成整数，而且她们本来就非常愿意把人家教她们的转教给我，其热心的程度和我想学的热情一样高。

就这样，我受到一切良好的教育，即使我生来是和她们一样的贵妇人，我的教育也不过如此。在某些方面，我还要胜过我的小姐们，虽然她们的地位在我之上。这是因为我有很高的天赋，不是她们的富贵所能得到的。第一，我分明比她们长得漂亮。第二，我的身材比她们好看。第三，我唱得好，那是说我的乐感比她们强。请让我声明：这些话并不是我自己的意思，凡是认得那家的人都这么说。

除了这许多优点之外，我又具有女性共有的虚荣心，我很明白人家都真的觉得我很漂亮，或许可以说把我当作绝代美人，我对自己的赞美自然也不下于任何人。我特别爱听人们谈论我的姿容，这是我常能听到的，听了觉得非常快活。

从生下来一直到这个时候，我的生活可以说是很平静的，不仅是大家都知道我住在一个良善的人家，那家的声望远播四方，谁都晓得那家的人全很规矩，具有各种美德，而且人们也都看到我是个规矩守礼，贞淑贤惠的姑娘。我的性格也的确是这么好：我没有机会去打什么坏主意，或者去尝一尝邪恶的引诱到底是怎么一回事。

但是我所感觉骄傲的美貌却做了我堕落的种子，或者可以说我的虚荣心是我失身的根源。我所栖居的那家的贵妇人有两个儿子，一对行为端正，前途无限的青年。这真是我的不幸，我同他们两位都很好，可是他们对待我，各有各的态度，大不相同。

大的一位是个纨绔子弟，他不只懂得乡下的事，就是城里的事也很熟悉。虽然他禀性轻浮，会有不道德的举动，但是他太聪明了，绝不肯花很大的代价来寻快乐。他开头设的圈套是一切女人所最容易落进去的，那就是，他一有机会，就拼命赞美我长得多么漂亮（他是这么说的），态度多么可爱，举止多么端庄和其他这类的话。他做得那样得法，那样巧妙，他勾引女人的手段简直同他打鹧鸪的本领一样高明。有时他知道我虽然不在面前，却在可以听见他谈话的附近地方，于是故意向他妹妹称赞我。他的妹妹会轻轻地对他说：“小心些，哥哥，她能听到。她只在隔壁。”他立刻止住了，声音放低了，好像起先真的不知似的，承认他不该这么大声说。过了一会儿，仿佛是偶然忘记似的，又大声地颂扬我。我既是那么爱听人家的赞美，自然不会失去机会，而不去仔细地谛听。

他既然这样把鱼饵放在钩上，一点也不费力地将鱼钩放在我的面前，就公开地玩弄他的把戏了。有一天他走过他妹妹的房间，我正在那里替她穿衣服，就很高兴地走进来。他对我说：“啊，柏蒂姑娘，你好吗？你脸上着了火没有，柏蒂姑娘？”我向他行个礼，双颊羞红起来，一句话也没有说。

小姐说：“你怎么这样讲话，兄弟？”

他说：“我们刚才在楼下谈论她整整谈了半个钟头。”

他妹妹说：“对于她，你们说不出什么坏话来，这是我可以相信的，所以不管你们说什么都不碍事。”

“不，”他说，“我们绝不是说她的短处，我们讲了她许多好话。我告诉你，我们都在那里称赞柏蒂姑娘，公认她是科尔切斯特城里最美丽的少女。总而言之，城里人喝酒时都高举杯子祝她健康。”

“我听了你的话真觉得奇怪，”他的妹妹说，“柏蒂只缺乏一件东西，但是她少了这一件，就等于什么好处都没有了，因为人们现在对于女性的评价是不公道的。比如一个年轻姑娘长得非常美丽，家庭也是贵族，受过良好的教育，聪明灵巧，态度又好，礼貌又周到，可是她要没有什么妆奁，人们就不会去理睬她，好像她没有这些好处一样。但是只要一位姑娘有钱，那么谁也会喜欢她，男人总是要想法子得到她的好处。”

她的弟弟刚好也在旁边，叫道：“住口，姐姐，你讲得太随便了，我就是一个例外。请你们相信我，假如我找到一位姑娘像你刚才说的那样十全十美，我决不去问她有没有妆奁。”

“不过，”他的姐姐说，“你自己一定会留心不去爱上那种没有钱的姑娘。”

“这也不是你能晓得的。”那个弟弟说。

“但是，为什么，妹妹，”那位哥哥说，“为什么你们这样攻击男人看重妆奁呢？不管你们缺乏什么，你们都不是没有妆奁的人。”

“我明白你的用意，兄弟，”小姐很严厉地回答道，“你以为我虽然有钱，却缺乏了美丽。但是按照现在的习俗，有钱的人就是长得平常点丝毫也不碍事，所以我比那种有色无钱的朋友们占了便宜。”

“可是，”她的弟弟说，“你的朋友们也会和你们相比的。因为有时美貌也可以得到一个丈夫，虽然并没有钱。一个侍婢偶然比她的小姐长得漂亮，也常同她的小姐嫁得一样富贵的丈夫，她还会比她的小姐早些出嫁哩。”

这时我想我应该离开他们，所以我就走出来，但是我并没有走开多远，所以还能听到他们的议论。果然我听了一大篇赞美我的话，这更把我的虚荣心煽动起来。但是不久我却看出这会使我失去对这家人的好感，因为那位小姐同她的兄弟为了这些小事大吵起来。他为着要袒护我，对她说出几句很不客气的话，我看出她要报复到我身上来，的确是冤枉了我，她怀疑我与她的兄弟有什么关系，我却从来没有想到。可是那位哥哥淡淡地好似开玩笑地说了许多话，我却很傻，竟把这些话信以为真，有些话应当认为他是无意说出的，或者是信口胡说的，但是我却因为这类话自己怀起妄想来了。

有一天他偶然跑到楼上来，同往常一样向着他妹妹常常在那里工作谈天的房子走去。还没有进来，他就和往常一样地大声叫她们，我刚好独自待在房里，就走到门口，对他说：“先生，小姐们不在这儿，她们到花园散步去了。”当我走向门口来讲这句话的时候，他刚好走到门前，好像偶然似的双手把我抱住。他说：“啊，柏蒂姑娘，你在这儿？那是再好不过了。我真想和你谈谈，那比跟她们谈天有味得多。”他就把我拥在怀里，一连吻我三四次。

我挣扎着想跑开，却只是没有力气，他紧紧地抱着我，还在那里继续地吻我，等到他的气几乎接不上来的时候，他坐下说：“亲爱的柏蒂，我真爱上你了。”

我得承认，他的话燃着我的热血。我心头乱跳，现出精神错乱的样子。他重述了好几遍他真的爱上了我，我的心明白地告诉自己我爱听他这句甜蜜蜜的话，而且每回他说“我真爱上你了”的时候，我脸上的红霞可以说在那里明白地回答着：“但愿你真爱上我了，先生。”然而并没有什么别的举动，虽然对我是件意外的事，他走后我也就恢复常态了。他本想同我再多待一会儿，但是偶然看看窗外，他的妹妹正从花园走来，他赶紧离开我，又同我接吻，对我说他绝不是开玩笑，不久还要告诉我别的话。他很快活地走开了。假使后来没有那件不幸的事，我倒是对的，但是不管柏蒂姑娘多么认真，这位少爷却实在不过是逢场作戏。

从那时候起我脑里有了许多怪念头，我真可以说精神有些错乱。有这样一位公子对我说他爱上了我，说我是个多么标致的人。这真叫我不知道怎么办好，我的虚荣心升高到极点。不错，我心中充满了骄傲，但是我并不知道当时人们的邪恶，所以对于我自己的安全和品行一点也没有顾虑到。假使我的年轻主子一开头就对我怎么样，他尽可以为所欲为。但是他没有遇到好机会，这可以说是我的幸运。

这回进攻之后，不久他又有机会捉到我，情境差不多是一样的。的确，一半或者是由于他的故意安排，虽然我一点疑心也没有。那次的情境是这样的：那两位年轻姑娘和她们的母亲出外拜访人家去了，他的兄弟也不在城里，他的父亲去伦敦已经一个礼拜。他天天都在注意我，知道我在什么地方，虽然我连他在家没有都不知道。他活泼地走上楼来，看见我在那里做事情，就一直走进房里，同前回一样地开始拥抱着我，一气吻了差不多有一刻钟。

那次我是在他的第二个妹妹房里，家里既然只有几个女仆在楼下，他对我或许比前回更粗野些。总之，他的确对我认真起来，或者他觉得我太随便了，因为他把我拥在怀中亲吻的时候，我对他并没有任何抵抗。真的，我太喜欢他这样吻我，绝不会怎样去抵抗的。

但是这种行动把我们都弄疲倦了，我们坐下，他和我谈了许久。他说他被我迷住了，日夜都睡不着，直到他告诉我他是多么爱我。假使我也能够爱他，使他得到幸福，那么我真是救了他的性命。此外，他还说了许多这类好听的话。我对他没有说什么话，但是完全显得是个傻子，一点也不了解他的用意。

他在房里踱来踱去，拉着我的手，跟我一同走。终于得到一个机会，他把我摔在床上，万分热烈地吻着我。但是说句公道话，他并没有什么粗野的举动，只是长久地吻着我。后来他似乎听到有人走上楼来，就离开了床，把我抱起，自称他多么爱我，告诉我这全是真挚诚恳的爱情，并不是他对我怀有什么恶意，说着就把五个金币放在我手里，走下楼去。

他这次给我钱把我弄糊涂了，前回的谈情还没有这样扰乱我的心田。我觉得非常兴奋，差不多忘记了我所处的地位。我把这时期叙述得特别详细，为的是假使有天真烂漫的年轻姑娘看到我这篇故事，她们可以学会怎样保护自己，因为幼年时就知道自己长得多么美丽常常是她们堕落的先导。假使一个年轻姑娘以为她自己很美丽，那么无论谁来对她说被她迷住了，她是绝不会怀疑的，因为她既然相信她自己有勾魂的容貌，那么人家被她迷醉是当然的事了。

这位年轻公子不仅引起我的虚荣心，而且也激动了他自己的情欲。他好像发觉刚才让一个很好的机会白白错过，心里有些追悔，差不多过了半个钟头又跑上来，和我像起先一样地玩，不过没有用那么多的情话来做开场。

他一走进房子，就转过身，把门关好。他说：“柏蒂姑娘，我起先以为有人走上楼来，是我听错了。但是，”他继续说，“现在就是他们发觉我和你同在一个房里，也不会看见我正在吻你。”

我告诉他我想不出会有谁走上楼来，因为我相信只有厨子和一个女仆在家，她们都不走这个楼梯。

“不过，我亲爱的，”他说，“小心点总无妨。”说着他就坐下，我们开始谈天。我现在因为前一回的事还是心迷意乱，没有说什么话，但是他好似把话放在我口上，告诉我他是多么热情地爱我，虽然要等到他得了产业才能够完成大事，但是他已经决心要使我快乐，也使他自己快乐，这就是说，那时候他要娶我。他还说了许多这类甜言蜜语，我真是一个可怜的傻子，猜不出他的真意，心里老以为在世界上一切爱情的结局都是美满的婚姻。假如他当时就向我求婚，我绝不会有什么考虑，而且我也舍不得拒绝他，不过当时我们还谈不到结婚这个问题。

我们没有坐多久，他就站起，把我吻得不能出气，又将我摔在床上。那时我们两个人的心都热起来了，所以他对我有进一步的举动，那说出来是不太体面的。即使那时候他有更进一步的举动，我也绝不会反对他。

但是他虽然对我这样随便，他还没有给我人们所谓的“最后恩惠”。说句公道话，他并没想那样做。而他后来就把这个自制做他同我各种瞎闹的借口。玩完以后，他停了没有多久，就差不多拿出满把的金子放在我手里。走开时还说出万般柔情的话表示他的恳挚，说世界上我是他最爱的女人。

我现在应该开始考虑了，但是，唉，我并没有实实在在地细想一番。我有无限的虚荣心和骄傲，却只有一点道德观念。我有时自己也在那里忖度，我的年轻主子到底有什么用意，但是想来想去，只想起他所说的甜言蜜语和所给的金子。 他到底有没有心娶我，对我倒似乎是件无关紧要的事情。我也没想到有同他订个条件的必要，后来他却正式提出条件来，这些事你们在下面就会看到了。

我就这样自投罗网，甘心堕落，连想一下都不想，所以我很可以做那些道德观念被虚荣心压倒了的年轻姑娘的“榜样”。我们两方面都是再傻不过的。若我是规规矩矩的，顾着自己的道德和名誉来拒绝他，这位公子或者因为看出他的诡计没有实现的希望，就停止向我攻击，或者堂堂正正地向我求婚，那么不管谁去骂他，总没有人能够说我有什么错处。总而言之，假使他真了解我，知道他所追求的那一点点小事情是多么容易到手，也不至于那样整天操心算计，尽可以给我四五块金币，下回碰到我时就和我睡觉。另一方面，假使我真懂得他的心事，知道他以为我是多么不容易到手，我很可以任意向他提出条件，即使我没有要求他立刻和我结婚，也可以让他答应在未结婚以前给我一笔生活费，这样我想什么就可以得到什么，因为他现在已经很有钱，将来还可以继承大份产业。可是我把这些念头完全丢开，一心只想自己是多么美貌，现在又有这样一个公子来垂爱，满心都是骄傲。至于他给我的金钱，我有时接连好几个钟头睁大眼睛看着，把金币数了又数，每天都要数上一千遍。从来没有一个可怜的骄矜女子像我那样全心都放在这件浪漫事情上，既不去想我的前途，也没顾及堕落就在眼前。我想我大概是喜欢堕落，不愿想法去躲避。

可是在那时期我却很狡猾，不让那家人有怀疑我的余地，猜出我同这位年轻公子有什么暧昧事情。在大家面前我几乎连瞧他一眼都不瞧，有人在旁边时，他和我说话我是不答应的。尽管如此，我们却常有机会在无人处碰到，说一两句话，有时候接一下吻，可是没有好机会容我们干出想做的坏事，并且因为他不知道我的心事，所以他说了好多用不着说的委婉的话：他心想那是件很难办的事情，自己倒把那事情弄得难办了。

但是魔鬼是个百折不回的诱惑者，他总是在那里找出机会来诱使人们变坏。一天黄昏时候，我正同他与他的两个妹妹在花园里游玩，他偷偷递了一个小纸条给我，告诉我他第二天要当众叫我替他到镇上去办一件事，然后我在半路上可以见到他。

第二天午餐后，他当着他的两个妹妹很正经地对我说“：柏蒂姑娘，我要求你一件事。”

“什么事？”他的第二个妹妹问。

“妹妹，”他又是很正经地说，“假使你今天放不开柏蒂姑娘，那么她哪天替我办都可以。”

她们说她们可以放得开我，那个妹妹请他原谅不该这么问。

“可是，哥哥，”他的大妹说，“你得告诉柏蒂姑娘要她干的是什么事，假使是我们不能听的私事，你可以带她出去讲。你现在就可以对她说。”

“怎么，妹妹，”他很严肃地说，“你是什么意思？我不过要她到高街的（他说着拿出一块白纱巾）一家店铺去。”然后，他就告诉她们他怎样看中了两条好围巾，还了价，现在要我去，故意去买一个领子来配这条他拿在手里的纱巾，去试一试他们肯不肯照我的价钱卖那两条围巾。叫我添一先令，跟他们讨论一下价钱。他还要我做许多别的小事情，所以我今天会有充分的理由在外头待很长时间。

他把我的差事派好之后，又详详细细地告诉她们他要去拜访一个她们都知道的人家，今天有谁会到那里去，他们一定会玩得很有趣，所以他很正式地约他的妹妹和他同去，她们也同样正式地请他原谅，因为她们已经通知的那些朋友今天下午会来拜访她们；这一切都是他故意安排好的。

他刚刚和她们谈完，他的仆人就进来同他说魏爵爷的马车停在门口。他赶紧跑下去，立刻又上来。“哎呀！”他大声地说，“我想好的一场欢乐都一笔勾销了。魏爵爷打发他的马车来接我，要和我谈件紧要的事情。”其实这魏爵爷是住在离城三里多路的一位绅士，他昨天特意去向他借马车，说有用处，他让马车三点左右来接他，所以现在马车刚好来到门口。

他立即叫人拿最好的假发、帽子同佩剑来，一面叫他的仆人到那家去说他不能与会——就是想法把他的仆人打发走——他就预备上车出去了。临走的时候，他停了一会儿，沉着脸对我讲他的事情，得到一个机会就低声对我说：“我亲爱的，快点来，尽可能地快点来。”我没有答应，只向他行个礼，仿佛是答应他在大众面前所说的话。过了一刻钟光景我也出去了。我的衣服同日常穿的一样，不过口袋里放有一条头巾，一副假面，一把扇子和一副手套；所以家里人一点也不怀疑我。他在一个僻巷里等我，知道我一定会由那里经过。他已经对车夫说好了，要去的地方叫哩端，那里住着他的一个亲信，我们就到那里去。在那里，凡是世上干邪事的方便件件都有，我们爱怎么做就怎么做。

当我们两人在一间房里的时候，他起初很严肃地和我谈天，说他并不是带我来欺骗我。他对于我的爱情不许他随便欺侮我，他打算一得到财产就娶我。现在假使我肯答应他的要求，他可以担负我的一切用费。此外他还说了许多话，说他对我多么诚恳，多么爱我，永久不会丢弃我。说真的，他实在用不着说那么多的话来做引子。

但是他逼着我回答他，我就说他既是屡次向我声明，我当然不至于怀疑他的真情，可是——说到这里，我停住了，好似要他去猜余下的意思。

“可是什么，我亲爱的？”他说，“我料到你的意思了：假使你怀了孕又怎么办呢？是不是这个意思？那时，”他说，“我自然要照顾你，供给你和小孩的费用。我要你相信我并不是开玩笑，你先拿这笔钱做个信物吧。”说着就拉出一个真丝钱袋，里面有一百金镑。“我每年都给你这么多，”他说，“直到我娶你为止。”

看到这个钱袋，听到他那热情的请求，我的脸一会儿红，一会儿白，说不出话来。他很容易看出我这种神情，就把钱袋放在我的怀中。我对于他再也没有任何抗拒，让他为所欲为，不管他要求多少次，我总是答应的。就这样我的堕落可说是立刻完成了，因为从那时候起，我失去了我的贞节同廉耻，我不值得上帝赐福或者人们帮助了。

但是事情并不是这样就算了。我回到城里，把他当众叫我办的事情办好，一会儿就回了家，谁也没有怪我在外头待得太久。至于我那位公子，他告诉我他要到晚上很晚的时候才回来，他果真回来很晚，所以家里人对我和他都没有什么猜疑。

这次以后，我们常有机会在一起——多半是他有意去安排的——特别是在家里，当他的母亲和两个妹妹出外访人的时候，他总是非常小心地注意这种机会，绝不让它错过。他总是早就弄清她们什么时候要出去，看到我一个人独自在房里，又没有遇到别人的危险，就立刻进来，所以差不多有半年时光，我们尽情欢娱，而且最使我满意的是我并没有怀孕。

但是这半年没有过完，我前面所提到的他的弟弟对我下起功夫来了。在一天黄昏的时候，这个弟弟瞧我一个人独自在花园里，就开始和我表演同样的一套，很诚实地说他多么爱我，总之公正堂皇地向我求婚。

我现在真是万分震慑，弄得走投无路，世上没有人像我这样进退维谷了。我顽强地反对他的提议，用许多道理来维护自己。我告诉他这种婚姻是多么不平等，他的家人一定不会好好地待我，而且他的父母从前在我最困苦的时候慷慨地收留我，这样就太忘恩负义了。总之我用尽我所想得到的理由劝他放弃这个打算，只是没有把真实情形告诉他，假使说出来，当然可以绝对了事，但是我实在不敢。

可是有一种情形的确出乎我的意料，使我不得不想些办法。因为这位二公子的性情是很坦白诚实的，他对于我没有丝毫虚假，那是他的本色。他知道自己是很光明磊落的，所以他对于柏蒂姑娘的好感，并不瞒着他的家人，和他的哥哥截然不同。虽然他没告诉她们他向我求过婚，可是却谈了许多话，让他的姊妹看出来他很爱我。他的母亲也很明白。她们虽没有向我说什么，却对他很留意，而且她们对我的态度也立刻改变了，和往常绝不一样。

我已经瞧见了乌云，虽然还没有看到暴风雨。我很容易看出她们待我和以前不同，而且一天天坏下去，后来我很快听说他们要请我搬到外面住了。

听到这个消息，我并没有感到害怕，我知道他们总会另外想法安置我的，尤其现在我随时都有怀孕的危险，一旦到了那一步，我也是非搬出去不可的，并且也没有任何借口了。

没过多久，二公子找到一个机会来通知我，他对我的殷勤传到他家人的耳里了。他并不怪罪于我。他说，他很清楚这消息是谁泄露的。他告诉我这完全是他素常说话太坦白了，因为他没有把对我的爱慕当作一件秘密，而实际上他是很可以这样办的。他之所以这样，是因为他已经决定，我一答应嫁给他，他就公开地向她们说他爱我，打算娶我。不错，他的父母会生气，会待他不好，可是他一向是学法律的，现在能够自己谋生了，他有把握能够供养我。总之，他相信我既然不把嫁他当作一件可耻的事，他也绝不把娶我当作一件可耻的事。他不怕说出他是倾心于我的，因为将来我做了他的夫人，他还要当众宣布，所以现在我用不着恐慌，只要答应他的求婚就行了，其他一切事情都由他负责办理。

我当时真觉得可怕，我深深地追悔我和他的哥哥太随便了。这并不是我的良心发现，因为我根本不懂什么叫作良心，而是我绝不肯既做了一个人的情妇，又去做他兄弟的妻子。而且，我还想到那位大哥答应过我，他一得到财产，就可以娶我。可是我忽然记起我近来常常想到的一件事，那就是他把我弄到手之后，就一个字也不提娶我这件事了。我说我常常想到，但是直到现在我的确并不觉得有什么不放心，因为他爱我的热度好像一点也没有降低，他还是那样慷慨地给我钱，虽然他很小心，叮嘱我不要花一文钱去买衣裳，或者打扮得同平常有一点不同，因为谁都知道我素来是得不到这类东西的，这一定会引起家里人的猜疑，一定是与哪位有了暧昧交情。

我现在真是进退两难，不知道怎样办才好。最麻烦的是这位弟弟不只天天纠缠着我，而且让别人也看出他这痴情。他走到他姐姐或者他母亲的房里，坐下来，甚至当着她们的面，也对我说很多悦耳的话。这就渐渐弄得谁都知道，全家人都谈论这个问题。他母亲责备他，她们待我的态度也大大改变了。总之，他的母亲故意透出几句话，好像她打算让我到外头去住。干脆一句话，就是想把我赶出家门。那时我想他的哥哥一定也知道这些事情，不过他或者不会想到——那是谁也想不到的——他的弟弟已经向我正式求过婚。但是我很容易看出他的弟弟还会更进一步，所以我觉得绝对有和他谈论这件事情的必要，不然他也一定会来找我谈，是我先去告诉他呢，还是我不管这件事，让他来问我呢，我不能决定哪一种办法更好些。

我现在的确严肃地考虑事情了，这是我一向所没有的。经过严肃考虑之后，我决定先去对他说。不久我得到了一个机会，因为第二天他的弟弟有事要到伦敦去，家里人又要出外拜访人家，这种情形恰和从前一样，在这里是经常的，每有这样的机会他照例来和柏蒂姑娘玩一两个钟头。

他来坐了一会儿，立刻看出我的脸色和往常有些不同。我对他不像从前那样放纵快乐，特别是我才哭了没有多久。一会儿他全看了出来，很体贴地问我有什么事情，有什么苦恼。假使我能够隐瞒过去，我一定不说出来，但是我实在无法隐藏我的哀感，所以先让他追究好久（其实我也是很想说出来的），最后我告诉他的确有点事情使我烦恼，是一件我不能不告诉他的事情，可是我不知道怎样向他说才好。这件事情不仅叫我惊骇，并且把我弄得糊涂了，除非他替我指出一条路，我真不知道如何是好。他温柔地说，不管是什么事，我切不可暗自受苦，因为他要保护我，不让世上任何人欺侮我。

我故意从离题很远的地方说起，对他说我怕有人暗地里把我们的关系告诉大家，因为很容易看出她们近来待我的态度变了。现在她们经常找我的错处，有时很和我过不去，虽然我一点错也没有。从前我总是和那位大姐同睡，最近她们叫我一个人睡，或者跟女仆同床。我好几次偶然听见她们很尖酸地谈论我。但是最显明的是一个女仆告诉我，她听说她们要把我赶出去，因为我是个危险分子，不能再留在家里。

听了这些话，他笑了笑，我问他怎么把这件事看得这么不重要，他应该明白假使我们的私情被人家发觉，我是一世不得出头的，甚至对他也有妨碍，虽然不像我那样。我责备他，说他和一般男子一样，当一个女人的人格和名誉全在他的掌握之中，听他发落的时候，他常常拿来开玩笑，最少也是不当一回事，将已经上了他们当的女人的名誉看作是无关紧要的。

他看出我的态度又激烈又严肃，就立刻换了一种口气。他说他觉得很难过，因为我会把他当作这样一个人。他待我并没有什么不对的地方，值得我这样谴责。他一向把我的名誉看得像自己的一样宝贵。他敢说我们的来往做得很巧妙，家里人绝对不会怀疑。我告诉他我的心事的时候，他之所以微笑，那是因为他最近听到几句话，使他更加相信我们的私情是没有人猜到的。只要我听说他所以这样放心的原因，我一定也会像他那样笑的，他知道这个消息一定会使我十分满意。

“这真是个弄不懂的秘密，”我说，“被人撵出家门总不会使自己觉得满意。既然我们的来往并没有被她们发觉，我自己也不知道做了什么事，使得她们全家都换一副面孔对我，她们从前待我是多么慈爱，仿佛我是她们自己的儿女一样。”

“孩子，”他说，“她们对你有些不放心，这是真的。可是她们一点也没有猜到真相，没有想到你我的关系，他们所怀疑的倒是我的弟弟洛宾。他们的确相信他向你求爱。那个傻家伙简直是公开地告诉她们，他老和她们开玩笑说他打算娶你，把自己做个笑柄。我承认他不应该这样，因为他一定会看出这些话会使她们不高兴，因此对你冷淡起来。但是这使我觉得很满意，因为这更可以保证她们绝不会来怀疑我，我希望这也会使你满意。”

“就这一方面讲，”我说，“我自然觉得满意。但是我的主要问题并不在这里，最使我烦恼的并不是这方面的问题，虽然我对于这点也很关心。”

“那么，你的主要问题是什么呢？”他问。跟着我就流下泪来，说不出话了。他尽力安慰我，渐渐一步紧似一步地要我说出到底是什么事。最后我告诉他，他应当知道这件事，他有权知道这件事，并且我希望他替我指出一条路来，因为我心里太乱了，实在不知道走哪条路好。我就将全部事情和盘托出。我说他的兄弟实在不该这样瞎讲，弄得大家都知道，因为假使他很秘密地进行，我只需坚决地拒绝他，不说出什么理由就行了，过些时候他自然会停止他的恳求。但是他起先就很自负，以为我绝不会拒绝他，后来又随随便便地通知全家人他决定要娶我，这么一来，事情就不好办了。

我说我是怎么样地拒绝过他，他的求婚又是多么诚恳正经。“但是，”我说，“我的境遇是苦上加苦。现在她们待我不好，因为他想娶我。将来听到我居然拒绝了他，她们一定会待我更坏，因为她们马上想到这里头有黑幕，自然会看出我已经同别人偷情了，不然我绝不至于谢绝这个超乎我地位之上的婚姻。”

这些话的确使他很惊讶。他说这实在是千钧一发的时候，他也想不出一个使我脱身的良方。但是他要去仔细考虑一下，下次我们相会时，他可以告诉我他考虑的结果，现在我对于他弟弟既不要答应，也不要公然拒绝，暂时可以采取犹疑不决的态度。

听他说让我不要答应他兄弟的求婚，我惊得要跳起来。我说他该明白，对于别人的求婚，我是无从答应的，因为他已经说好将来娶我，我也早已答应要嫁他。他一向总是说我是他的妻子，我自己也以为是他的夫人，好像我们已经举行过婚礼一样。我所以会这样想，全因为他始终要我自称为他的妻子。

“我亲爱的，”他说，“现在不要去管这些小节了。即使在名义上我不是你的丈夫，我还是像丈夫一样地关心你。现在不要让这些零碎事情搅乱你的心，这事我仔细考虑一下，下次见面时再把我决定的办法告诉你。”

他用这些话安慰我，但是我看他心事重重，虽然对我非常体贴，吻我不止一千遍，还给我钱，但是我们同在一起足有两个钟头，他却没有什么别的举动，想起我们从前的习惯而今天又有这样的一个好机会，我的确觉得很纳闷。

他的弟弟五六天后才从伦敦回来，又过了两天他才有机会和他的弟弟细谈，他们很亲切地讨论这个问题。当天晚上他找到一个机会把他们谈的话重述给我听（我们谈了很久），尽我记忆力之所及，他们的谈话大略是这样的：

他告诉他弟弟，他去伦敦时，听到一个关于他的奇闻，就是他向柏蒂姑娘求爱。

“是的，”他弟弟有点生气，说，“怎么样呢？谁管得了这些事？”

他哥哥说：“别生气，洛宾，我并不是说我要来干涉。我也没有因为这件事和你生气。不过我看她们对于这事倒很关心，她们待那可怜的女孩也不好了，我看到这种情形，觉得很难过，好像我自己挨了人家的冷眼一样。”

“你所说的她们到底是谁？”洛宾说。

“我是指母亲和那两位姑娘。”他的哥哥答道。

“我问你，”他的哥哥说，“你不是开玩笑吧？你真的爱上了那位姑娘吗？”

“好吧，”洛宾说，“让我坦白地告诉你。我爱她超过世界上一切的女人，我非得娶她，让她们爱怎么说就怎么说，爱怎么办就怎么办吧。我相信那姑娘不会拒绝我。”

当他告诉我这些话的时候，我的心大受感动，因为虽然照常理来说我是绝不会不答应的，但是我深深地懂得我不得不拒绝他，我也看出这次不得已的拒绝是我一生不幸的祸根。可是我知道这个心思应该藏在心里，口里只好讲出另外一套话，所以我就用下面这些话来打断他的叙述。

“哦！”我说，“他认为我不能够拒绝他吗？但是尽管如此，我到底还是能够说个‘不’字。”

“亲爱的，”他说，“先让我把我们的谈话报告完，然后你再说话。”

他继续说下去，告诉我他怎样回答他的弟弟。

“但是，弟弟，你知道她是一个钱也没有的，你却非常可能娶一个妆奁丰厚的小姐。”

“这绝不能够影响我对这位姑娘的爱情，我结婚是因为我爱上了一位女人，绝不是单为着填满我的腰包。”洛宾说。

“所以，”他对我说，“亲爱的，我们简直没有法子反对他。”

“是的，是的，”我说，“你看我倒能够反对他。我现在学会了怎样去拒绝人，虽然我从前没有学过这套本领。即使世上最可羡慕的王公大臣现在来向我求婚，我也能够高高兴兴地对他说‘不行’。”

“但是，我亲爱的，”他说，“你能够对他说什么呢？照你前次所说的，你知道，他会用百般的话来追问你，全家人都会纳闷儿这到底是怎么回事。”

“怎么，”我微笑着说，“我只要告诉他，我已经嫁给他的哥哥了，立刻就能堵住她们的嘴。”

他听了我的话笑了一下，但是我看出我的话使他很惊慌，他那失措的神情是无法掩饰的。他回答道：“虽然这话有一点道理，但是我想你要这样告诉她们，只是开开玩笑，因为这样一说对我们有许多不便的地方。”

“不，不，”我欣然说，“没有得到你的允许，我自然不愿意随便泄露秘密。”

“但是，”他说，“他们看到你坚决反对一个对你那么有利益的婚姻时，你要用什么话去回答他们呢？”

“我怎么会找不出话来回答他们？第一，我用不着把理由告诉他们，这不是我的义务。并且我可以对他们说我已经嫁了人了，而不说出嫁的是谁。这样一来他也是一筹莫展，因为他没有什么理由再进一步追究我。”

“不错，”他说，“但是全家都要来麻烦你，你要坚决不肯说出真相，他们一定对你翻脸无情，并且还要怀疑你。”

“那么，”我说，“我怎么办呢？你要我怎么办呢？我早已告诉过你我感到万分为难，所以我才把始末告诉你，好让你出个主意。”

“我亲爱的，”他说，“这事我考虑了几千遍，这你一定相信的。现在我所想的办法虽然使我感到无限痛心，你听了或者也会觉得奇怪，但是通盘考虑一下，我看最好还是让他进行。如果你觉得他很诚恳多情，你就嫁给他好了。”

听了这几句话我现出恐怖的面容，脸色灰白得要命，几乎从我坐的椅子上摔下来。他吓了一跳，大声喊道：“我亲爱的，你怎么啦？现在觉得怎么样？”还有许多这类的话。他一面推我，一面叫我，渐渐把我喊醒，不知又过了好久，我的神志才完全清醒过来，有好几分钟不能够说话。

当我完全恢复常态的时候，他又开始说话。“我亲爱的，”他说，“我本打算让你好好地考虑一下。你很可以看出家里人对于这事的态度，假使她们知道这里面还关联到我，她们一定要气疯了。这样的话，我想我同你都会弄得身败名裂。”

“哦！”我愤怒地说，“你一切的海誓山盟就因为家人反对全化作云烟吗？我一向老是告诉你，你家里人是不会高兴的，你却总以为无关紧要，从来不理会。你看现在不是得到这样的结局吗？这就是你的忠实诚恳，你的爱情，你的信义吗？”

尽管我百般埋怨他，他始终是那样安然不动。我拼命地责骂他，他最后回答道：“我亲爱的，我对你从来不曾食言。我的确告诉过你，我得到财产的时候，我要娶你。但是你看我父亲身体还是这么康健，即使再活三十年，还不会比镇上的几个老头子老。你从来没有提起要我在这以前娶你，因为你知道这或者会把我的前途断送。至于其他方面，我从来没有使你感到失望。”

他这一番话我是一句也不能否认的。“但是，”我说，“你既然没有抛弃我，为什么劝我走那条可怕的路，叫我抛弃了你呢？你既然是那样一往情深，你以为我就一点眷恋，一点爱情也没有吗？我没有报答过你的深情吗？我没有证明过我的热情和诚恳吗？我为了你，甘心牺牲了我的名誉和贞节，难道还不能证明我俩相爱已深至不容拆散吗？”

“但是，我亲爱的，”他说，“现在你可以得到一个安全的地位，立刻能够体面地光荣地站在人前，我们从前所干的事此后可以谁也不提，好像没有这回事一样。我永远爱你，不过那是正经的爱，完全对得住我的弟弟。你将来是我亲爱的弟媳，好似你现在是我亲爱的……”说到这里，他停住了。

“你亲爱的情妇，”我说，“你一定会这样说，不过我很懂得你的意思。但是，我希望你记得你从前对我的娓娓长谈，你花了好几个钟头，说了许多话要我相信我还是个清白的妇人。你说我实在可以算是你的夫人，虽然世上没有人承认。我们的结合是很正当的，和由牧师证婚过的没有多大区别。你知道这些都是你亲口对我说的。”

我看出这些话有点使他难过，但是我还是接着说下去。他呆在那里，一言不发，我又继续说：“假使你相信我听了你这么多话，答应你的一切要求，而心中却没有一个毫无疑义，万劫不拔的爱情，你就太不对了。假使你以为我是那么卑鄙的人，我一定要问你我做了什么事，使你对我存有这样的看法？假使我因为受了自己内心热情的搅扰，答应了你的要求，假使我从前相信了你的话，以为我的确算是你的妻子，现在你要我把这些话一笔勾销，把自己当作你的情妇或者外家（那是一样的）吗？你要把我移交给你的弟弟吗？你能够改变我的爱情吗？你能够叫我不爱你，而去爱他吗？你以为你叫我爱谁，我立刻就能够爱谁吗？不，先生，请你相信，这是做不到的，不管你那一方怎样变化，我总是忠心不贰的，现在事情既然弄到这般不幸的田地，我情愿当你的情妇，而不肯做你弟弟的夫人。”

他听了我后面这几句话，现出很高兴很感动的神气，告诉我他还是从前的他。他所答应我的话没有一句食言，但是一想起现在这件事，有许多可怕的情景就摆在他的眼前，所以他觉得那个办法是补救的唯一办法。他以为这并不会使我俩完全分开，我们一生中可以互相敬爱像好朋友一般，或者我们大家所处的地位会比现在更快乐些。他还说我用不着害怕他会泄露秘密，因为秘密一经泄露，我们两个要一同遭受毁灭。他现在只需问我一个问题，那是同这个办法有关的，假使我的回答是否定的，他以为这是我现在唯一的办法。

我即刻猜出他的问题——我有没有怀孕？关于这个问题我叫他不要担心，因为我并没有怀孕。

“我亲爱的，”他说，“我们现在没有时间再谈下去了。请你回头把这事再仔细考虑一番，我总以为那是你的唯一补救良方。”说了这句话，他就向我告别了。他走得特别快，因为他正站起来想走的时候，听到他的母亲和妹妹在门口按铃。

他走后我的心绪纷乱如麻。第二天和那星期余下的几天（我们谈话那天是星期二晚上），他很容易看出我心境不宁，但是他没有接近我的机会。一直等到星期日，我因为有些小病没有到教堂去，他也找了个借口，待在家里。

现在他有一个半钟头的时光独自和我在一起，我们又把前次的谈话重复了一遍。最后我热烈地问他，他到底认为我有廉耻没有，居然以为我肯先后同两个兄弟同床。我坚决地告诉他这是绝对办不到的。我又说，假使他声明此后再也不见我的面（除开死外没有一件事情会比这个更可怕了），我也不至于想出这么下贱的主意，想嫁给他的弟弟。所以我恳求他，假使他对我还有一点点的尊敬和爱情，就不要再向我提这个办法，不然还是抽出剑来，把我刺死好些。

他觉得我这样的固执（他以为这全是我的固执）是出乎他意料的，他说我待自己太残忍了，也可以说是对他太残忍了。这次事变是我们所预料不到的，我们谁也不能够预先瞧见，但是他看出，除开这条路，没有第二个办法可以免得我们两人沦落，所以他觉得这就更残忍了。他更加冷淡地接着说，假使我不许他再提这个办法，那么他以为我们没有什么可谈的了。他站起来向我告别。我也站了起来，好像也是无动于衷的样子。当他和我接了个吻似乎表示离别时，我放声痛哭起来，就是想说什么话，也说不出了，只是握着他的手，拼命地哭，仿佛就要和他永别的样子。

他的确很感动，又坐了下来，对我说了许多亲切的话，为的是减轻我过分的悲哀，一面还是劝我采取他所提的办法，一面声明假使我不肯这样办，他当然要供给我将来的生活费。但是他的话里充分地表明，在那个主要问题上面他不肯和我再有任何纠葛——即使我当他的情妇也不行。他认为他不该再和一个或者可以变作他的弟媳的女人同床，他认为这是人格问题。

单单失去一个献殷勤的公子倒不会使我感到很大的悲伤，但是我实在爱他这风采翩翩的人儿，我爱他几乎爱得发狂，而且我一向总以为他有一天会做我的丈夫，现在一切希望都没有了，因此我很痛心。这些事是那样沉重地压在我的心头，弄得我竟害了一场大病。我心里无穷的烦恼终于使我发起烧来，而且热度老是不减，全家人都以为我一定会死的。

我的精神疲惫万分，常常心迷发狂，但是我最放心不下的是怕我心迷的时候，会说出对他不利的话来。我很想看见他，他也很想来看我，因为他实在很爱我。但是这是办不到的，我们谁都不敢奢望有相会的机缘。

我差不多整整躺了五个星期。虽然到第三个星期时我的高烧就退了，但是又反复了好几次。医生有两三回都说他们无能为力了，只好让我的体力去和病魔决斗。五个星期之后我渐渐好些，但是仍然软弱无力，形容憔悴，现出十分忧郁的神色，而且恢复得很慢，所以医生担心我会变成肺结核。最使我烦恼的是他们认为我心里有事，有说不出的苦恼，以为我是堕入了情网。于是全家人都来追问，逼着要我说出我是不是坠入了情网，我的情人是谁。我自然全盘否认我同谁有什么爱情。

一天因为我的事，他们在饭桌上争吵起来，几乎把全家闹得天翻地覆。那天除了家长之外，他们都坐在桌旁。我因为生病，躺在房里。谈话开始的时候，他们刚吃完饭。老夫人叫他的女仆到我房里，问我起先她送进去的东西我要不要再吃一点。她的女仆下去回说她送上去的东西我还没有吃完。

“唉！”老太太说，“可怜的孩子！我恐怕她的病是不会好的。”

“哦！”大哥说，‘柏蒂姑娘怎么会好？他们说她是害着相思病。”

“我不信这些话，”老夫人说。

“我不知道，”大姐说，“说实话，他们总在捧她，说她多么漂亮，多么可爱和许多别的话，我相信那女孩子听了这类的话，一定会胡思乱想起来，谁知道她心里打着什么鬼主意？我简直不知道怎么说好。”

“怎么，妹妹，你总得承认她长得很美丽吧。”大哥说。

“不错，比你好看得多，姐姐，”洛宾说，“所以你心里觉得难过。”

“这是题外的话，”他姐姐说，“那女孩长得还可以，她自己也很清楚。用不着人们对她赞美，让她自己觉得了不起。”

“我们不是说她有什么了不起，”大哥说，“我们是讨论她钟情于谁。或者她钟情于自己，妹妹们好像是这样想。”

“我希望她能钟情于我，”洛宾说，“那么我一定很快使她逃离现在这种苦痛。”

“你是什么意思，儿子？”老夫人说，“你怎么会这样说话？”

“怎么，太太，”洛宾很老实地接着说，“你想我能让这位可怜的姑娘害相思病而死，而她心里的人——我就在她的身旁吗？”

“呸，哥哥！”他的妹妹说，“你怎么能这样说！你肯娶一个一文钱都没有的姑娘吗？”

“请你听我说，小姑娘，”洛宾说，“美貌也可以说是一份妆奁，好脾气也是一份妆奁。我希望你在这两方面有她的一半做你的妆奁也就好了。”

这样一来，她就无话可说了。

“我看，”大姐说，“假使柏蒂没有坠入情网，我的兄弟倒是坠到里头去了。我真奇怪他还不把这段心事对柏蒂说，我敢说她绝不会说个‘不’字的。”

“人家一求婚，立刻就答应了的人比那些从来没有人向她们求婚过的人高一等，”洛宾说，“比那些还没有人来求婚就先答应了的人高两等。这是我的回答，姐姐。”

这几句话触怒了他的姐姐，她发起脾气来，愤愤地说事情已经弄到这步田地，这小东西（指我）非得赶出家门不可。现在病着不好赶出去，但是等将来病好的时候，她希望她的父母不要忘记把这小东西撵走。

洛宾回答道，这是家长同主妇的事情，用不着像他姐姐这样不懂事理的人来管。

他们继续闹下去，那位姐姐肆口谩骂，洛宾冷嘲热讽。因此可怜的柏蒂在那个家里完全失去了立足之地。我听到他们吵嘴，就痛哭起来，老夫人走来看我，有人告诉她我很担心他们的争吵。我向她诉苦，说医生们真是太没道理了，他们一点证据也没有，硬说我是害相思病。并且想到我在这家里所处的地位，他们更不该这样胡说，我说我希望没有做过什么事使她看轻我，她的儿子同女儿的争吵也不是由于我的不是。我现在应当想的是棺材，而不是爱情。我求她不要因为别人的过失而误解了我的为人。

她知道我说的是实话，但是她说他们现在闹得这么厉害，她的第二个儿子又是那样整天喋喋不休，她希望我能够忠实诚恳地回答她一个问题。我说我愿万分坦白地诚恳地回答她。那问题是，她的儿子洛宾同我到底有什么关系。我尽力表示我的诚恳，我的确是很诚恳地对她说，我们并没有丝毫瓜葛。我说洛宾先生老是喋喋不休，乱开玩笑，她也知道这是他的习惯，这是无关紧要的信口开河，我想他自己也并没有别的意思。我请她相信我们中间没有丝毫她所想象的暧昧行为。那些随便宣传我们有什么关系的人真是太冤枉我了，对洛宾先生也只有害处。

老太太十分满意，吻我，很快乐地同我谈话，叮嘱我好好保养身体，缺什么东西可以向她要，说着她就走出去了。但是当她走到楼下的时候，他看见二儿子同两位姊妹正在舌战。她们气得不得了，因为他说她们长得太平常了，从来没有过一个爱人，也没有人向她们求过婚，相反的，她们却去向男人们献殷勤，几乎等于向他们求婚。他故意拿柏蒂姑娘做例子来讥笑她们，说她多么美丽，性情多么温和，唱得也比她们强，跳舞也胜过她们，比她们好得多。凡是能使她们难过的话，他没有一句不说，的确是太过分了。老夫人下来的时候，他们正吵得厉害。为了使他们住口，她就把刚才我们的谈话全篇告诉他们，连我同洛宾先生并没有丝毫关系的话也告诉了他们。

“她错了，”洛宾说，“我们假使没有密谈过，我们现在也不至于这样隔膜了。我对她说我很爱她，但是我没有法子让那小姑娘相信我的诚意。”

“我不晓得你怎样能够让她相信，”他的母亲说，“对一个你明知境况极坏的可怜姑娘说这套话，凡是没有丧心病狂的人都不能够相信你是诚心诚意的。”

“但是请你听我说，儿子，”她继续说，“你既然告诉我你不能使她相信，我们又怎么能相信呢？因为你说话时总是东拉西扯，乱说一阵，谁也不知道你到底是真是假；但是我从你自己说的话里听出那孩子对我说的都是实话。我希望你也说实话，认真地对我说出你的心思，使我也好知道，这里面到底有什么事没有。你是认真，还是开玩笑，你到底被她迷住了没有。这是很重要的问题，我希望你能够坦白地说出来，好叫我放心。”

“皇天在上，太太，”洛宾说，“再扭扭捏捏地不说，或者再多扯些谎都是没有用的。我是诚恳的，同一个快去受绞刑的人一样地诚心诚意。假使柏蒂姑娘肯说她爱我，愿意嫁给我，我情愿明天饿着肚子把她娶来。我可以不吃早餐，我急着要说‘属于我的，永久属于我的’。”

“好吧，”母亲说，“那么我的儿子算是完了。”她说这话时声调非常凄楚，的确是很担心的样子。

“我希望并不算完，太太，”洛宾说，“一个人找到一个好妻子，并不算是完了。”

“但是，儿子，”老夫人说，“她同叫花子一样地穷。”

“但是，太太，”洛宾说，“因此她更需要我们的仁慈，我把她娶来，免得教区还要出钱养她，她可以同我一起行乞。”

“拿这些事来开玩笑是不对的。”母亲说。

“我不是开玩笑，太太，”洛宾说，“我们要一起请求您的原谅，您的祝福，太太，同我父亲的祝福。”

“这全是废话，儿子，”母亲说，“假使你真想这样，你的一生算是完了。”

“我想不会，”他说，“我真怕她不肯嫁给我。经过我姐姐这阵恫吓，我相信我现在怎样劝她，她也是不肯嫁给我的。”

“你真是说得好听，可是她还不至于傻到那样的地步。柏蒂姑娘并不是蠢货，”他的第二个姐姐说，“你想她会比别人特别，敢对求婚的人说个‘不’字吗？”

“不错，爱说笑话的姑娘，”洛宾说，“柏蒂姑娘不是蠢货。万一柏蒂姑娘已经同别人订婚了，那又怎么办呢？”

“对了，”大姐说，“这我们可不知道了。但是，和她订了婚的人会是谁呢？她从来没有走出过家门，那么总是你们两兄弟中的一个。”

“我没有什么话说，”洛宾说，“我已经受过你们的审问了。这里还有我这个哥哥。假使总是我们两个人当中的一个，你们去问他好了。”

这句话正打中他哥哥的心坎，他以为洛宾发现了什么。他面上装做没事的样子。“请你，”他说，“别把你的事套在我头上。我告诉你，我和这样的姑娘是一向没有关系的。我对于柏蒂姑娘没有什么可说，对于教区里一切像柏蒂姑娘这样的人，我也是无话可说的。”说了这几句话，他就站了起来，匆匆地走开了。

“不会的，”大姐说，“我敢替我这位兄弟担保，他比你懂事得多了。”

他们的谈话就这样结束了，但是把大哥弄得很迷惑。他断定他弟弟已经全知道了，渐渐怀疑到是我走漏了风声。但是无论如何，总找不到机会和我密谈。最后他真是焦急得不得了，不管结果怎样，一定要到我房间来看我。有一天午餐后，他注意着他大妹妹的行动，看她是上楼去的，故意跟在她的后面。“啊，妹妹，”他说，“那位病了的姑娘躺在哪里？谁也不能去看她吗？”

“我想你可以去看她，”他妹妹说，“可是先让我进去，等一下我再告诉你。”她就先跑到门口，告诉我一声，立刻叫他上来。“哥哥，”她说“，假使你想来，现在可以来。”他走进来，还是带着开玩笑的口吻。

他走到门口的时候说：“那位害相思病的人在哪里？你好吗，柏蒂姑娘？”

我想站起来，但是太虚弱了，好久才站了起来。他和他妹妹都看到这种情形，他妹妹说：“不要勉强站起来了。我哥哥不拘这些礼节，尤其是你现在这么虚弱。”

“不，不，柏蒂姑娘，请坐着别动。”他说着自己就坐在我对面的椅子上，好像很高兴的样子。

他对他妹妹和我说了一大堆乱七八糟的话，东拉西扯，无非是替他妹妹解闷，有时又提到爱情的事，自然是对我而发的。“可怜的柏蒂姑娘，”他说，“坠到情海里的确苦恼得很，你现在已经很憔悴了。”

最后我说出这几句话：“看你这么快活，我心里很高兴，先生，但是我想医生也太无聊了，闲着没事，拿病人来开心。假使我的确得的是这种病，那么我很知道通常的那句俗话，绝不会让他来诊察。”

“什么俗话？”他说，“啊！我想起来了。‘病人害的是相思，医生就同驴子一样的傻了。’是不是这句俗话，柏蒂姑娘？”

我没有说什么，只是轻轻笑了一下。

“不，”他说，“我想就医治的结果来看，恐怕真是爱情在作祟吧，你看医生对你仿佛没有多大帮助。他们都说你好得很慢。我恐怕这里头有些奥妙，柏蒂姑娘。我怀疑你得了不治之症，那就是相思病。”

我又轻轻一笑，说，“不，真的，先生，这不是我的病。”

我们谈了许多这类的话，有时还说些不相干的话。他请我唱支歌给他们听，我听了又是微微一笑，说我唱歌的日子已经过去了。最后他问我要不要听他吹笛子，他妹妹说这恐怕我受不了。我鞠一躬说，“小姐，请你别阻止他，我很爱听笛子的声音。”

他妹妹就说，“好吧，哥哥，你吹吧。”

他拿出他房间的钥匙。“好妹妹，”他说，“我懒得很，请你到我房间，把我的笛子拿来，在一个抽屉里，”他故意说出一个他明知道笛子绝不会放在那里的地方，这样他妹妹就得找好半天。

她一走开，他就把他弟弟所说的关于我的话全告诉了我，还有他怎样为我焦急等等，所以他要设法同我谈一下。我告诉他我从来没有对他弟弟或者任何人谈到我们的私情。我告诉他我现在所处的地位多么危险。我说因为我真诚地爱他，而他现在又叫我忘了我的爱情，把心移到别人身上，我才病倒床上。我有好多次真想自己死去，而不愿意复原，再像从前一样和困难的环境奋斗。我还说我预料到我病好了的时候，得立刻离开这个家，至于嫁给他弟弟这个办法，因为我与他既然有了这段私情，我一想起来就感到无限的厌恶。他尽可放心，我一定不会和他弟弟见面时再谈这件事。假使他不顾他的诺言、誓语和赌咒，那只是因为他没有良心，不顾人格。但是他从前讲了许多话要我相信我是他的妻子，我也让他真正把我当作他的妻子。他既然这样，就不能说我对他不保持妻子应有的忠贞，不管他是怎样待我。

他正要详细解释，刚说到他劝我无效，心里很难过，还要讲下去，却听到他妹妹走来，我也听到了。可是我还是勉强说出几个字来回答他。我说他总不能够说服我，叫我爱着一个人，又嫁给那个人的弟弟。

他摇一下头，指着自己说：“那么，我算毁了。”他妹妹走进来，告诉他找不到笛子。他用快乐的口吻说：“可见懒惰是不行的。”于是就自己去找，可是回来也没有带着笛子，并不是他找不着，而是因为心里有点不安，不想吹了，何况他派妹妹去的目的已经达到。因为他无非是想和我谈话，虽然谈的结果不能叫他很满意，可是这个目的总是达到了。

能够这样自由地坦白地把心里的话告诉他，我倒觉得很满意，虽然不能够照我所希望的那样发生效力。也就是说，使他更加对我负责，但是这样说了以后，他就不能离开我，除非他简直不顾人格，将上等人的信用一笔丢开。他从前不是常常用他的人格和信用担保他永远不会抛弃我，等财产一到手就要娶我做他的妻子吗？

没过几个星期，我渐渐地复原，又能在院子里走动了。但是我仍然很愁闷，不愿和人接触，这使全家人都很惊奇，除了知道此中道理的他。但是过了好久他也没有理会这种情形，我也像他一样躲闪着不愿交谈，对他总是恭恭敬敬的，从来没有向他讲过一句什么特别的话，这样持续了十六七个礼拜。我天天都预料着被她们撵出去，因为她们都很不喜欢我，虽然我并没有什么罪过，我也同样预料到他再也不会对我说什么话了，尽管他从前怎样庄严地立下誓言，我想我算完了，被他抛弃了。

最后我自己向那家人提出迁居的话来。有一天我很郑重地对老夫人谈到我现在的境况以及我病后精神的烦闷。老太太说：“柏蒂，我恐怕，告诉你关于我儿子的话使你的心境不宁，你的愁闷或许也是因为他的缘故。假使对你没有什么不便，那么请你告诉我你们两人中间到底是怎么一回事？至于洛宾，每回我询问他的时候，他总是开玩笑地胡说一阵。”

“太太，”我说，“现在的情势实在不是我所希望的，我要把这事情的始末全盘说出，也不管对我有什么后果。洛宾先生有好几次向我求婚，这真是出乎我的意料。但是我一直拒绝他，也许我说的话有些太过了，原不该这样说的，因为我对您家里的每个人都应当很尊敬。可是，太太，”我说，“我绝不能够忘记你们全家人的恩惠，而去答应一件事情，心里却明知这件事是对不起你们的。我就将这些话作为我拒绝他的理由。我坚决地对他说，除非我能够得到您老人家和他父亲的同意，我绝不肯存这个心思，因为我对于你们是感恩不尽的。”

“这是真的吗，柏蒂姑娘？”老夫人说，“那么，你很对得住我们，我们却待你太坏了。我们一向以为你在那里勾引我的儿子，因此我还想请你搬出去呢。我还没有跟你提起，因为我想你还没有全好，我怕会使你太伤心了，又要病倒。我们对你还是很看重的，虽然不肯因为你而毁了我儿子的前途。但是假使事情的真相像你所说的，我们的确是太冤枉你，太难为你了。”

“我所说的都是真话，太太，”我说，“请你问问你的儿子，假使他是凭良心说话，不想冤枉我，那么他所说的绝不会和我刚才讲的有什么差别。”

老太太立刻跑去找她的女儿，把我刚才说的话全告诉了她们。她们都很惊奇，这是你可以猜得到的，我也早知道她们一定会感到惊奇。一个说她绝对没有想到，一个说洛宾是个蠢货，又有一个说她是一句也不能相信的，担保洛宾所说的一定会大不相同。但是这位老太太决意要在我没机会把这事通知她的儿子以前，把事情弄个明白，所以立刻要找她的儿子来谈话。她特意派仆人去叫他回来，他是为着自己的一点小事到城里一个律师家里去的，一听到她的吩咐，他立刻回来了。

他到家的时候，她们还同坐在一间屋子里。“坐下，”老夫人说，“我有几句话非同你谈谈不可。”

“非常愿意，太太，”洛宾说，显出很愉快的样子。“我希望你是和我商量怎样替我娶个好妻子，因为对于终身大事我真不知道怎么办好。”

“怎么会没有办法呢？”他母亲说，“你不是说打定主意要娶柏蒂姑娘吗？”

“不错，太太，”洛宾说，“但是有一个人阻止我们的婚姻。”

“阻止婚姻！”他母亲说，“是谁？”

“就是柏蒂姑娘本人。”洛宾说。

“怎么会呢？”他母亲说，“那么，你征求过她的意见吗”

“是的，太太，”洛宾说，“从她得病后，我正式向她求过五次婚，都碰了钉子！这丫头固执极了，她不肯答应。什么条件都不行，除了我实际办不到的条件。”

“讲明白些，”母亲说，“我真是莫名其妙，我不懂得你的意思。我希望你这回不是开玩笑。”

“哦，太太，”他说，“我的情形是很明白的，用不着解释。她说她不要我，这不是很明白吗？我想这是很明白的，并且太伤人了。”

“但是，”母亲说，“你讲讲你实际上不能答应的条件吧。她要的是什么，是不是想要一份产业呢？她可得到的产业应当按照她的妆奁来定，但是她带了什么妆奁给你？”

“不，说到妆奁，”洛宾说，“她的美貌就是一份好妆奁，这点我是很满意的。可是我却不能满足她的要求，而且她很坚决，除非我能满足她，否则她不肯答应。”

这时他的姊妹插嘴了。“太太，”他妹妹说，“你无法正正经经地与他谈一件事，什么话他也不肯好好地回答。你还是让他一个人去吧，不要和他再谈这些事了。假使你以为这里面有什么把戏，你尽可以暗地里把她打发出去。”洛宾看到他妹妹这样刻毒，心里有些生气，但是他也针锋相对地说了些尖酸话。“天下有两种人，太太，”他对他的母亲说，“是没有办法与其辩论的：聪明人和傻子。我要同时对付这两种人，的确有点太辛苦了。”

他二妹妹插嘴说：“在二哥的眼里，我们一定都是傻子，他以为我们会相信他当真向柏蒂姑娘求过婚，而她居然拒绝了他。”

“所罗门说：‘回答了，其实并没有回答’，”她哥哥说，“你哥哥对母亲说他向柏蒂姑娘求婚不下五次，她都坚决拒绝了，我想母亲既然相信，做妹妹的就用不着来怀疑。”

“你要知道，我母亲没弄懂你的意思。”他妹妹说。

“要我解释清楚是一回事，”洛宾说，“说我母亲不相信我的话却又是一回事。”

“好吧，儿子，”老夫人说，“假使你愿意让我们知道这里头的秘密，那么请你告诉我你所谓困难的条件是什么。”

“太太，我早就想说明白了，可是爱捣乱的人老在这里打岔，真把我烦死了。她的条件是我必须得到父亲和你的同意，不然的话她绝不肯再和我谈这件事。这个条件，真像我起先所说的，我怕永远没有法子答应。我希望我这两位热心的姊妹对于我的回答能够感到满意，脸会红的。假使她们还没有满意，那么只好等将来我有什么消息的时候再告诉她们，现在是无话可说了。”

这个回答她们听了都很惊奇，然而母亲并没有，因为我已经和她说过。至于她的女儿，她们愣了半天说不出话来。母亲却有些动气地说：“这事我早已听过了，但是我不能相信。假使事情真是这样，那么我们大家就太冤枉柏蒂了，她做事这样合情理真是我们意想不到的。”

“哦，”他妹妹说，“假使真是这样，她的行为的确是值得赞美的。”

“我承认，”母亲说，“假使他偏要当傻子，爱上了她，这不是她的错处。但是她的回答表现出对于你的父亲和我无限的敬意。从此以后我要更加看重这位姑娘。”

洛宾说：“我可看不出这姑娘有什么特别的好处，除非你答应我的要求。”

“我要考虑一下，”母亲说，“我告诉你假使不是因为还有别的阻碍，她这种举动会得到我的同意的。”

“我希望你会完全同意，”洛宾说，“假如你对我的情绪安宁也像对我的财产那样关切，你一定会很快答应我这件事。”

“怎么，洛宾，”母亲又说，“你真是出于诚意吗？你真像说的那样想要娶她吗？”

“是的，太太，”洛宾说，“我想这真是太难了，我对你说了很多，你还是怀疑我的诚意。我要不要娶她现在也不用说了。你明知道没有你的同意，我就不能娶她，我又有什么办法呢？但是我要声明我有万分诚意，除非是万不得已，我决不娶别人。究竟娶柏蒂或者谁也不娶，现在请你决定吧，太太，不过我这两位和蔼可亲的姐妹却不必提出任何意见。”

这些消息在我听来是可怕的，他母亲开始有些允许的意思。洛宾更是竭力地逼着她答应。并且当她和大儿子商量的时候，他就用尽世上所有的理由劝她同意，说他弟弟对我一往情深，我这样甘心牺牲自己的利益，顾全这些无关紧要的体面，对全家多么有义气，还有许多这类的话。至于他们的父亲，他是个公务忙碌的人，一心都在弄钱，常常不在家里，整天考虑外面的机会，这类的事就全归他的夫人料理了。

你们很容易想到，事情这样一来，那位大哥既是没人怀疑他，当然就更容易接近我，更不怕什么危险了。还不止这样，他的母亲，正中他的心愿，托他去同柏蒂姑娘商量。“或者，儿子，”她说，“你看事会比我更透彻一点，你可以去探一探她到底是不是像洛宾说的那么坚决。”这正是他想干的事，可是故意装作勉强答应的样子。他母亲就把我带到她自己房里，当着他的面对我说她托她儿子和我谈一件事，说完就走出去了。让我们两人谈话，他接着就把门关好。

他回到我面前，双臂将我抱住，温柔体贴地吻着我，告诉我他要同我长谈一次，他说事情现在已经到了紧要关头，我将来一生的幸与不幸全靠我现在的决定。事情已经到了这个地步，假使我还不迁就他的主张，我俩都要毁了。接着他就把洛宾同他母亲、姐妹和他谈话的经过告诉了我，像我所说的那样。“现在，好孩子，”他说，“想一想得到全家人的允许，嫁给一位家道富有门第高贵的公子，享受世上一切的快乐，这是多么好的一件事。否则变成个声名狼藉的女人，坠到黑暗的境遇里。虽然在我活着的时候，我总会尽朋友的义务，可是我处处受人怀疑，你一定怕见我，我也不敢承认我们的关系。”

他不等我回答，一口气对我说下去：“我们之间的关系。孩子，只要你我同心隐藏，是可以掩盖起来，把它忘掉的。当你做我弟媳的时候，我将永远做你忠实的朋友，也不想有什么更密切的关系。我们此后可以老老实实地谈天，谁也不埋怨谁做了错事。我求你把这事仔细想一想，不要妨碍了自己的安全和幸福，为了表示我的诚意，我现在送你五百镑现金，赔偿我从前对你的放荡行为。这些事我们要当作是我们一生中的愚蠢行为，希望我们以后去悔过吧。”

他这些话讲得那么动听，我真是没有法子表达出来，他所举的理由又是那么合情合理，也不是我所能够重述得来的。所以只好请读者们相信，他既然一口气和我谈了一个半钟头，他自然将我的一切辩驳回答得非常圆满，用尽人类的聪明智力使他自己的理由毫无破绽，壁垒森严。

我可不能说他讲的话对我产生了什么影响，使我的意见有所变更。直到最后他很率直地告诉我，假使我反对他的办法，他觉得很抱歉，此后我们的关系就不能再像从前那样了。虽然他还是那样爱我，我还是那样可爱，可是他的道德心还没有完全丧失，他绝不肯与一个他弟弟正式求过婚的女人同床。假使他今天离开我的时候，得不到我的同意，那么为了履行他从前的诺言，尽管将来在赡养方面怎样帮助我，可是他希望我不要见怪，他是不能再来看我了。其实我也知道他是不会再来了。

听到最后这段话，我感到很惊慌，好容易才鼓起力气来，免得晕倒，因为我爱他到了不可想象的程度。但是他也看出我不安的神色，求我好好考虑一下，要我相信这是保存我们感情的唯一办法。这样我们可以互相亲爱像朋友一样，彼此非常殷勤，而我们的感情又只是纯洁的，丝毫不带我们过去失检行为的痕迹，也不至于引起人们的疑心。他将来的一切幸福都将认为是我所赐的，他此后活在世上的时候总是把我当作他的恩人，只要一息尚存，无不竭力图报的。就这样，他渐渐使我对这件事情有点犹豫了，他把我的危险说得加倍动人，再加上我自己的想象，想到独自走到茫茫的世界里去，被人们看作是个被赶出家门的淫妇，将来的结果也许还不止于此。或者身边连一文养活自己的钱也没有，离开了这个城市，在世界找不出一个朋友、一个相识的人，但是又不好意思仍然留在这城里。这许多情形真是把我吓得要死，他又是一有机会就用极可怕的话将这些情形向我缕述，使我听了不由得心惊胆战。在另一方面，他总是侃侃地谈着，假使我听他的话，我将来的生活会怎样的舒适幸福。

我根据我们的感情和先前的密约提出了许多异议，他回答说现在我们不得不采取别种办法，因为目前有许多的困难。至于他答应娶我这一层，他说现在的情势已经不容许了，因为在他所答应的时间到来以前，我有成为他的弟媳的可能。

总之他讲了许多道理，真把我弄糊涂了。他驳倒我一切的理由，我又开始想到我从前未曾想到的一个危险：那是我被双方同时抛弃了，孤单单地留在世界上，要自己去想法觅衣糊口。

这些恐惧和他的劝诱慢慢占了优势，我终于答应了，虽然我非常不愿意，到礼拜堂去举行婚礼的时候，简直像套上锁链的熊一样。我有些担心，恐怕我一点也不爱的新丈夫，第一次和我同睡的时候，就会发现我的破绽。但是他的哥哥在他上床以前把他灌得醉醺醺的，到底是不是故意我却不知道，因此我觉得很放心，因为第一晚同睡的是个烂醉的丈夫。他怎样将他灌醉，我不晓得，但是我想他一定是打好主意，把他弄醉，使他弟弟分不出我是姑娘还是嫁过人的女人。他弟弟简直没有想到这件事，也没有在这上面花心思。

我要补述一下前面没说的事。这个大哥既然将我劝服，第二步就要劝服他的母亲，他绝不肯走开，要等得到她的完全同意，任凭他们去办，连他的父亲也只是写封信去通知一下。她最后同意让我们私下结婚，将来由她去和父亲交涉。他又去讨他弟弟的好，对他说替他帮了多少忙，他怎样把母亲劝服，得到她的同意，这些虽然都是真的，但他所以这样做并不是为了他弟弟，而是为了他自己。可是他这样孜孜不倦地欺骗他的弟弟，把自己的情妇转到弟弟手里做妻子，还得到弟弟的感谢，把他当作忠实的朋友。自然，为了保全自己，一个人的确会不顾人格，不顾正义，甚至不顾基督教的信仰。

我现在该回述他的弟弟洛宾了。他既得到了母亲的同意，就兴高采烈地跑到我面前来报告这个消息，将全部的经过说给我听，他的诚恳一看就可以知道。想到我要做欺骗这个诚实的君子的工具，心里的确很难过，但是又找不出什么补救的法子。他一定要娶我，我自然用不着告诉他我是他哥哥的情妇，虽然除了这句话我是没有别的法子推辞他的。所以我渐渐答应了他，最后我们终于结婚了。

新婚床上的秘密我不好意思讲出来，但是对于我最有利的是我上面说过的我丈夫到床上时已经烂醉了。第二天早上他也记不清和我行过房没有，我不得不告诉他已经做过了，虽然他并没有动作，这样我可以相信他不至于再去查究那一点了。

我跟这个丈夫同居的五年中的家庭琐事与我自己的情形和眼下所说的故事没有多大关系。我所要讲的只是我和他生有两个孩子，相处五年之后他死了。他对于我真是一个再好不过的丈夫，我们两人日子过得很快活。但是他从父母那里没有得到多少财产，他活着的那几年内也没挣很多钱。所以我的境况并不很好，结婚没有给我带来很多经济上的利益。我从前要他哥哥履行他的条件给我五百金镑，当我答应嫁给他弟弟的时候，他就送了我这笔钱。加上他起先给我，我积蓄下来的，连同我丈夫给我的数目差不多的钱，算起来我孀居的时候，一共有一千二百金镑。

我的两个孩子由我丈夫的父母领去，免了我许多麻烦。我倒觉得很高兴，这两个孩子可以说是他们从柏蒂姑娘身上得到的。我自认我失去丈夫的时候，并不怎样悲哀，这是很不对的。我也不能够说我曾经怎样地爱过他，我应当很爱他才是，最少也要报答他待我的好处。他的性情温柔仁慈，脾气又好，真可说是理想的丈夫。但是他的哥哥天天在我的眼前，至少当我们住在乡下的时候，对我仍然是个诱惑。我每次和我丈夫同床的时候，心里总是希望能够躺在他哥哥的怀里。虽然他哥哥从我们结婚之后一直也没有向我提起过那种风流事，他的态度全是大伯所应当有的，可是我对于他却不能这样地不涉遐思。总之我天天在想和他通奸，精神上犯了乱伦的大罪，就犯罪的性质来说，这真可以说与实行了一样有罪。

在我丈夫未死以前，他的哥哥结了婚，那时我们住在伦敦，老夫人写信邀我们去参加婚礼。我丈夫去了，我却假装有病，待在家里。因为，干脆一句话，我不忍看他被别的女人所占有，虽然我明知道自己是绝不能再嫁给他的。

我现在一个人在世界上真是无牵无挂，年纪还轻，容貌仍然很美丽，人们都这样说，我自己也是这么想，袋里也有相当多的钱，我的确是自视很高的。有好几个大商人向我求婚，有一个特别热烈，是个布商，我丈夫死后我就租了他家的房子居住，他的妹妹是我的朋友。在他家里我有一切的自由和机会可以恣意享乐，与我所喜欢的人们一块消遣，我房东的妹妹是世上最胡闹，最爱享乐的女人，她的道德观念并没有我起先所想象的那样高尚。她常带我去和放荡的人们厮混，她甚至把她很喜欢的几个人带来看漂亮的寡妇。我的声誉既然这么大，再加上这些傻子，我在那里真是格外地受他们的喜爱。有一大群人捧我，还有许多男子自命为爱人。但是在这许多男子里我却找不出一个惬意的求婚人。至于他们通常所用的诡计，我知道得太清楚了，不会再落到那种陷阱里去。这回我的情形与以前不同了，我自己口袋里有钱，用不着向他们要什么东西。我曾经被那个弥天大谎——所谓爱情——骗过一次，但是这个把戏已经收场了。我决定这一次要不就正式结婚，不然同任何人都不发生关系，嫁就要嫁好，不然干脆就不嫁人。

我真爱和他们在一起，他们都是嘻嘻哈哈，诙谐有趣的人。我常觉得他们很有趣，像我觉得另外一种人同样的有趣一样。但是经过仔细的观察，我看出最漂亮的人干出来的是最不漂亮的事——那是从我的目的方面来看，他们可以说是最不漂亮的。而那些带着最好的条件来向我求婚的人却又是天下最不漂亮、最令人讨厌的。我对于商人并没有什么嫌恶，可是我所嫁的商人必定要带些绅士风度才行，当我丈夫要带我到宫廷或者戏院去的时候，他佩起剑来应该很称身，走出来也像个绅士，与别的绅士没有多大区别，并不像那种在礼服上面留有围裙的痕迹，或者假发露出帽子的压痕。不是那种别人为他佩剑而那剑好像是硬插在他身上，满脸露出他那一行的商人的神气。

最后我找到了这个两栖动物，这个水陆两宜的东西，所谓绅士式的商人。这真是我的虚荣心的报应，我真可说是设阱自陷。我说设阱自陷，因为不是落到别人的圈套里面，却是我自己陷害了自己。

这个人是一个布商，因为虽然我的女伴想替我和她的哥哥撮合，但是正式谈判的时候，他似乎想让我做他的情妇，而不是做他的夫人。但我却始终忠于我的一个主张：一个女子有钱自养的时候，绝不要做人的情妇。

所以使我正直的原因，不是我的节操，而是我的骄傲。不是我的道德，而是我的钱。可是就我的结果看来，我觉得还得先让我的女伴将我卖给她的哥哥，总比现在这样把自己卖给一个商人好些。这个人同时是个浪子，是个绅士，是个商人，又是个乞丐。

但是我却匆忙地（心里被“绅士”这两个字迷住）把自己毁了，世界上还没有任何女人像我这样地毁了自己。我的新丈夫忽然间得到这一大笔钱，就拼命地挥霍，结果我所有的钱和他所有的钱，还没能维持上一年。

他有三个月的光景非常爱我，我所得到的是看他把我大量的钱花在我的身上。说真的，我自己也尝到了一些花钱的快乐。“我亲爱的，”一天他对我说，“我们去乡下住一礼拜散散心好吗？”

“好，我亲爱的，”我说，“我们到哪儿去呢？”

“我是随便去哪里都可以的，”他说，“但是我想在那一星期内我们要扮成贵族的样子。我们到牛津去吧。”

“什么，”我说，“我们当真去吗？我是不会骑马的，坐马车去，路又太远了。”

“太远了！”他说，“坐着六匹马的马车，到哪里去也不会太远。我要带你出去，你就得像个公爵夫人似的旅行。”

“哈哈，”我说，“我亲爱的，这真是恶作剧。不过，假使你愿意的话，我是不在乎的。”

于是定了一个日子，我们雇了一辆华贵的马车，六匹好马，一个马夫，一个左侧乘马的驭者，两个穿着最讲究的制服的仆人，一个骑在马背的跟班，还有一个帽上插着鸟羽，骑在另一个马上的侍童。仆人们都叫他爵爷，旅馆的掌柜自然也是这样称呼，我却是一位伯爵夫人了。就这样我们旅行到牛津去，的确逛得很高兴。说句公道话，世界上任何一个乞丐都不会比我丈夫更知道怎样摆出爵爷的架子。我们看到了牛津所有的古迹珍物，与两三位学员谈天，说有一个侄子现在是归爵爷照应，想把他送到牛津大学来念书，打算请他们做他的导师。我们还和几个穷学生开玩笑，答应将来起码叫他们当爵爷家里的牧师，使他们戴上大教士的肩巾。在牛津住了几天，花费起来真像个贵族，我们又到诺坦普吞去逛，总之遨游了十二天回到家里，一共差不多用了九十四镑。

花花公子总是很虚荣的，我丈夫既是如此，用钱素来是没有什么舍不得的。他的生平实在没有多少重要的事，用不着详细叙述，所以我只说大约过了两年零一季的光景，他破产了，又没有别的财路可通，被抓到执行吏那里去。他的案子太大，不能够保释出来，他就捎信叫我去看他。

这事不会使我惊讶，因为我早已看出形势有点不妙，尽量想法自己留些钱。但是当他找我去的时候，他表现得出乎我意料的好。他坦白地告诉我，他做了傻子，让自己破了产，这本来是可以预防的。现在看来没有办法了，所以他盼我回去，把家里所有值钱的东西乘夜运走，藏在别的地方。他说把东西搬走以后假使可能的话，从他店里拿走一二百镑的货物。“至于你拿了什么东西，拿到什么地方去，不用告诉我。而我自己呢，”他说，“我决定想法逃出这个屋子，远走高飞。假使你再也听不到我的消息，我亲爱的，”他说，“我希望你能够很快乐地过活。我觉得很对不住你，我实在害你不浅。”离别的时候，他对我讲了几句非常漂亮的话。我曾经告诉过你他是个绅士，在这点上我所得的唯一好处就是听了他许多好听的话。他待我着实不错，无论什么时候总是很有礼貌，甚至最后一次的会面。不过他把我所有的钱全花完了，让我去抢夺债主们的钱来维持生活。

我就照着他所说的去办，这是你们可以想得到的。我和他分别以后，再也没有看到他，因为他在当天晚上或者是第二天晚上就想法从执行吏那里逃走了。至于他怎样脱身我不知道，我只知道他早上三点钟左右跑回家，将我剩下的东西全搬去卖了，店也关了，带着他所能够筹到的钱跑到法国去了。他曾寄给我一两封信，以后就没有消息了。

他回家的时候我没有看到他，因为他既然告诉我怎样去做，我又要尽快把事情做好，我没有必要再回家来，而且我还怕在家门口会被那些债主逮住。因为破产的告示快要发出来了，他们可以根据委员们的命令抓我。但是我的丈夫拼命地从执行吏那里逃了出来，差不多从这一个楼顶跳到另一个楼顶，这个楼顶大约有两层高，很可能把他的脖子跌断，他却能够安安稳稳地再跳下来，跑回家去，将他的东西拿走，他的债主还不能够来抓他。因为他们还没有得到命令，可以叫警官来看管东西。

我的丈夫待我实在很客气，我现在还要说他的确是个绅士，他从法国给我的第一封信里，告诉我他在那家当铺里把二十块很好的荷兰布料子只当了三十镑，那些料子其实值九十镑以上。他把凭据寄来，还有一张付款取物的亲笔信，我把这些布赎出。抽空把它们割断，慢慢地等着机会零卖给住户人家，前后一共卖了一百多镑。

这些钱同我从前自己暗地里留下的相比，我觉得我的境况大大地改变了，但是我的财产比以前还是差得多了。将这些荷兰布，还有从前带走的一包棉纱布，几套杯盘和其他的东西一起估计，我看几乎还凑不到五百镑。我的情形很奇怪，因为我虽然没有儿女（我同我这位绅士式的布商生了一个孩子，可是已经夭折了），我是一个有丈夫的寡妇，我有一个丈夫，我不好再去嫁人，虽然我很清楚我丈夫即使活到五十岁也绝不会再回英国。所以不管人们向我提出多么好的条件我是不能够结婚的。在这种境遇下，我又没有一个可以商量的朋友，至少是没有一个我可以信得过敢对其说出我这种秘密身世的朋友。因为假使法庭里的委员得到风声知道我住在什么地方，我就要被传去，这样我所救出来的钱都要被他们拿去了。

怀着这些恐惧，我所做的第一件事情是将真实姓名隐瞒起来，而用一个假名字。这件事我办得很周到，我到一个很偏僻的地方租了间房子，穿上孀妇的衣服，把自己叫作弗兰德斯夫人。

我就隐居在这里，虽然我新认识的人们全不知道我的来历，可是不久又有很多人同我在一起了。我不知道到底是因为那地方的女人实在太少了，或者还是因为那地方的人太可怜，比别处的人更需要安慰，我很快就看出来一个可爱的女人是这些痛苦的儿子们非常重视的。那些把欠债打了折扣还还不清，天天吃饭要在招牌上画个“公牛”的饭馆记账的穷鬼们，假使他们喜欢了一个女人，却能找出钱来请客。

不管我怎样保护自己，像罗切斯特勋爵的情妇爱她的情人。却不让他再进一步一样，我渐渐得到荡妇的恶名，却没有享受到荡妇的快乐。为了这个缘故，我厌倦那个地方，也厌倦那些人，我开始有了迁居的意思。

这真是让我奇怪的一件事，看到境遇非常困难的人们，他们连破产的资格都够不上，他们的家庭是他们自己的恐怖的对象和别人慈善事业的对象，但是只要还剩下一便士，不，甚至不到一便士，他们总是努力用他们的罪恶来浇洗他们的悲哀。重新加上一层新的罪恶，极力想忘记以前种种的事情（现在正是他们要牢牢地记着的时候），积下更多的恶行做将来追悔的材料，继续作恶下去，用此来做补救过去罪恶的法子。

可是我是个不善于劝善的人。这些人的确太坏，甚至我也看不惯。他们作恶的方式是怪诞可怕的，因为仿佛有一种力量逼迫着他们作恶。他们不单违背了良心，简直还违背了天性。但是我们很容易看到悲叹怎样地阻塞了他们的歌声，他们总是面色苍白，带着悲哀的神情，不管他们怎样强笑为欢。不，有时在他们为了淫荡的享乐或者放肆的拥抱花了钱之后，也会亲口说后悔。我听着他们掉转头来，深深地长叹一声，说，“我真是一条狗！我亲爱的，我还是要举杯祝你健康。”他的妻子和三四个孩子或许连两三个先令都没有。第二天清早他又悔罪了，或者那个可怜垂泪的妻子去看他，不是告诉他他的债主怎样野蛮，将她同孩子赶出门去，就是带给他别的可怕的消息！因此更加深了他的自责。他想了又想，弄得简直快疯了，心里既没有什么稳固的道德观念，又不能相信上帝，从宗教上得到安慰。只觉得四面全是黑暗，他又跑去找那解忧的方法，就是用酒浇下去，用放纵的行为盖过去，和那些同处在一样环境的人们重演他的罪恶行为。这样，他一天一天向着毁灭的道路行进。

我还没有坏到同这些人能够相处的程度。相反地却很严肃地考虑到应当怎么办，我目下的境遇如何，我应该走哪条路。我知道我没有什么朋友，不，在世界上连一个朋友或者亲戚也找不出。仅有的一些钱很明显地一天天耗费完了，到用光的一天，我看是免不了饥寒穷困的。这么一想，我对现在自己的处境和天天摆在眼前的穷人生活觉得非常害怕，所以就决定搬到别的地方去住。

我认识一个很端庄的好女人，她同我一样也是寡妇，不过境遇却比我好些。她丈夫是一个商船的船长，由西印度群岛航行回国的时候，不幸中途遇险。假使他能够安全地航行到家，很可能发一笔财，可是现在却损失不少，他虽然救了自己的生命，但是忧患之余，他的心破碎了，后来不久就死去了。他的孀妇被债主逼得太紧，只好躲在这个穷僻的地方。她靠朋友们的帮助很快就把债务理清了，又重新成了一个自由的人。她看我也不过是躲避在那里，并不是同什么大案子有牵连，又看出我对她很同情，或者不如说她对我很同情，两人对于这个地方和居民都同样的厌恶，所以她就请我到她家去住，直到我能够在世界上找到一个安身立命之处为止。她又告诉我，在镇上她所住的地方十之八九会有一两个好船主喜欢我，向我求婚。

我答应了她的邀请，同她住了半年，本来还会同她住下去，但是在那半年里，她起先对我说的话却实现在她身上：她嫁了个好丈夫。但是不管别人的运气多么好，我却很倒霉，找不到什么人，只碰着两三个水手头或者这类的人。至于船长，他们大约可分为两类：（一）那些有很好的事情干的船长，就是驾驶着一只好船，一定是不结婚的，除非结婚对他们有利；（二）那些没有事做的船长想找一个老婆来帮他找船，我的意思是说：一、一个有钱的老婆，使他们能够买得起一个船的大部分股票，这样可以引得股东们委他做船长；或者二、一个虽然没有资产，却有朋友与轮船公司有关系的老婆，能够替这位先生找到一个好船长的地位。这两个条件没有一样是我办得到的，所以我像个卖不出去的歹货。

根据我的经验，不久我就懂得了一个道理：世事改变了，就连结婚也不例外。结婚是为了互相利用，为了共同的利益，为了做生意，爱情是没有多大关系或者根本没关系的。

我从前那位住在科尔切斯特的小姑就说过，长得漂亮，会说话，态度好，懂事，性情温和，正派，受过教育，德行高超，虔信上帝，以及其他身心方面的好处都不能够引动男人去同一个女子结婚，只有钱才能够使一个女人显得可爱。人们找情妇，的确是由于他们热情的激发，一个荡妇却必定要脸儿娇嫩，身材苗条，仪态万方，行动婀娜。但是说到娶老婆，不管她身体怎样残缺也不会觉得碍眼，无论品质多么低劣也不会发生问题。钱是唯一重要的条件，妆奁总不会是驼背弯腰的，也不至于乖张凶悍，钱无时无刻不是可爱的，不管老婆是什么样子。

男人们既然是这样挑选老婆，我看女人已经失去了拒绝的权利。假使有人向她求婚，那可说是无上恩惠。假使一位年轻姑娘居然很骄傲地假装拒绝一下，她绝不会再有拒绝人家的机会，更不能够挽救这一下的失足，重新答应她起先不过是假装拒绝的请求。男人可以到处挑选，女人的情形真是万分不幸！男人好像每个门户都要探一探，假使偶然出乎意料地被一家拒绝了，他很有把握在第二家一定受到欢迎。

并且我还看出人们毫不踌躇地跑出去四处寻找富家女儿，希望得到横财。他们自己是穷光蛋不配得到这么多妆奁，也没有什么别的能耐，值得人家送给他们财产。他们自视很高，几乎不许他所求婚的女人对他的性格和财产有所询问。我举一个很好的例子。我隔壁住着一位年轻的小姐，她和我很亲密。一个年轻的船长向她求婚，虽然她自己差不多拥有两千镑的财产，她只不过向他的邻居稍微探询了一下他的性格，他的品德和他的财产，他第二次来访的时候就乘机让她知道他对于这种举动是非常不满意的，再也不肯来打扰她了。我听到这个消息，自然去慰问一番。既然认得她，她和我谈了这事情的始末，很坦白地对我说出她心里的话。我即刻看出来，虽然她觉得自己受人欺侮，却没有报复的能力，她失去了他感到很难过，尤其是看到一个财产赶不上她的女人得到了他。

我劝她不要这么自卑，我认为她这种惋惜是很自卑的。我告诉她虽然我在世界上所处的地位是很低微的，可是我瞧不起这种人，他认为女人应该相信他的话，不许有探询他资产同性格的自由。我又对她说，她既有丰厚的财产，就用不着屈身忍受目下的不公平待遇！人们能够欺负我们这班缺乏妆奁的女人，已经很够了！假使她一味忍受这种侮辱，一点也不报复，那么她的身价就会随时降低，而且这城里附近的女人都会看不起她。我还说，女人绝不至于找不到机会报复一个待她不好的男人．我们有很多法子能让这样的男人丢脸，不然女人真是世上最苦的动物了。

她听了我的话很高兴，她诚恳地对我说她很想叫他知道她的愤慨，将来或者把他重新夺过来或者让大家都晓得她的报复，也落得个痛快。

我说假使她肯听我的话，我就告诉她怎样才能达到这两个目的。我敢担保我能把那个人重新带到她的门前，让他请求进来。她听了微微一笑，很快便告诉我，假使他再到她门前，她不见得会很愤怒，也不至于让他在门外等多久的。

可是她很愿意听我的策略。所以我告诉她第一件事是替自己说几句话，那就是说，她既在许多贵妇中间公开宣布他丢弃了她，自称是他拒绝她的，现在她应当利用一切机会使太太小姐们都知道，她调查了他的家境，发现并不像他自己所说得那么好。“让她们知道，太太，”我说，“他并不是你所希望的人，你觉得和他来往是很危险的。你又听说他的脾气很坏，常常自夸怎样虐待女人，尤其是听说他怎样的荒淫。”最后这个罪状的确不是瞎说的，可是我也看出她并不因为他的荒淫而减少了对他的喜爱。

我告诉她这个办法后，她立刻实行起来，马上跑去找宣传的工具，很容易就找到了。她只把她的故事向邻近两位喜欢闲谈的人随便一说，立刻就变作城里这块地方家家茶桌上的谈资。无论我走到哪里，总是碰到她们在谈论这件事。人们都晓得我同这位年轻小姐很熟，常常来问我的意见，我就说这些话全是真的而且还夸大其词，把他的性格说得一钱不值。此外我还添了几句别的喜欢说闲话的人没想到的话，好像是种秘密的消息，我说我听说他很穷，他现在需要一大笔钱来维持他所驶的那只船的股东对于他的信任。因为他自己所认购的股票没有付清，假使他不能在最短时间内付清，那只船的股东就不要他当船长了，他的大副大概会接他的手，这位大副提出购买船长从前答应买的股票。

我还说（说真的我心里非常不满意这个流氓，我把他叫作流氓），我听见一个传言，他有一个妻子还活着，住在普里穆斯，另外还有一个住在西印度群岛，她们都知道这种事情对船上的人们来说是很平常的。

这些话果然像我们所想象的那样有效，住在她隔壁的那位姑娘既有父母管理着她本人和她的财产，不久就把她关在家里，而且她父亲还不许他走进门来。在另外一个他常去的地方，那里的女人居然敢向他说个“不”字，尽管这是很奇怪的事。他每到一个地方，无不挨骂的，都说他太骄傲了，自命太高，不让女人探查他的性格以及其他这类的话。

现在他才看出自己的错误。我们这边的女人既然个个害怕他，他只好渡过拉提克力夫河，去接近那边的姑娘们。虽然那里的年轻妇女看到目下女子的蹇运，都很愿意有人来求婚，可是他的运气真是太坏了，他的名誉也跟他过了河，他在那边的声名同在我们这边一样。所以尽管他可能得到许多妻子，然而全不是那些有钱的女人，他的目的却是要娶一个富家的闺女。

我们的把戏不仅这些，她自己还很巧妙地安排了一个诡计。她找到一位绅士，是她的亲戚，已经结过婚的人，请他一星期来拜访她两三次，坐着很讲究的四轮马车，仆人的制服也辉煌夺目，我和她那两个工具立刻到处宣传，说这位绅士是来求婚的。他每年有一千镑的收入，他爱上了她，她要到城里她姑母家中去住，因为这位绅士每次坐着马车来勒德立夫找她太不方便了，我们这里的街道是那么窄，那么不平。

这诡计也立刻发生了效力。船长到什么地方去都受人们的揶揄，他自己真是宁可吊死。他想尽法子再来和她接近，用世上最热情的话来写信道歉，总之费了九牛二虎之力才得到许可来看她一下，他说是来洗清自己的名誉。

在这次会晤的时候，她报复得心满意足，她告诉他她真是纳闷他到底把她当成什么人，以为她会和一个人订立重要的婚约，而不先把他的境遇详细地调查清楚。假使他只想威吓一下，她就会答应嫁他，以为她和她的邻居们同样的来者不拒，那他可真是看错人了。总之，他的性格的确很坏，或者是他同邻人的感情太不融洽了，除非他能够洗清她很有理由猜疑的几点，她对他是没有什么话可说的，只好让他知道她是不怕说个“不”字的，对于他或者其他任何人都是一样。

她跟着就告诉他她所听到的，或者说靠着我和她所捏造出来的关于他的性格的种种传说，什么他还没有缴清股款，虽然他对人们说他是那个船的船长。股东们已经同意撤换他，由他的大副代替。人们对于他的道德说了好些闲话，说他与这个那个的女人有关系，在普里穆斯有个老婆，在西印度群岛还有一个以及其他这类的话。她问他假使他不洗清这些罪名，她有没有理由拒绝他，她现在对于这类重要的问题绝不放松，一定要他解释得使她满意才行。

他听到这些话，真糊涂了，一句也答不出，看他这么慌张，她几乎相信这些事全是真的，虽然她明知道这些谣言全是她自己凭空捏造出来的。

过了一会儿他精神安定了些，从那时候起他变成世上最自谦，最有礼貌，最屡求不倦的求婚人了。

她还和他开了许多玩笑。她问他是不是以为她是途穷日暮了，所以能够忍受，或者应当忍受这种待遇。他是不是看准了她不会要那些不惜从远方来求婚的人（暗指她弄诡计特地请来拜访她的那位绅士）。

她用了许多狡猾的手段，提出一切可能的条件要他服从，要他说出他的境遇和他素来的行为。他提出了无可否认的证据证明他是缴清了他所领的船的股款的。他又拿出他的股东们的委任状，证明要撤换他，由大副来接手这个消息是假的，是毫无根据的。总之，他一反他从前的态度。

就这样我使她相信，假使男人在婚姻这件事上占了我们女人的便宜，以为他们可以随便拣选而女人总是会答应的，那全是因为女人缺乏勇气，不敢坚持自己的地位。罗切斯特勋爵不是说过：

“一个女人无论怎样被人欺负，她总能够报复这个欺负她的人，那个‘男人’。”

这些把戏闹完以后，这位姑娘对付得非常好，所以尽管她决心要他，其实要他做丈夫是她计划的主要宗旨，可是她却让他知道得到她是世界上最困难的一件工作。她做到这个地步，用的不是妄自矜持的态度，只是一种以其人之道还治其人之身的正当法子，因为起先他举止昂然，自以为谁也不配探问他的性格，把查询他的性格当作一种侮辱，她就根据这点与他纠缠，一面尽量地查问他的种种事情，要他回答，这么一来他自然没有法子来穷究她的境遇了。

能够得到她做老婆，对他已经很够了。至于她的财产，她干脆说他既然知道了她的情况，自然她也有权知道他的情况。虽然关于她的情况他也不过是听别人说的，可是他曾经向她屡次声明他是多么痴情，实在不好再问别的，只好用伟大的请求和其他爱人们照例要说的废话来向她求婚。总之，他再也没有法子向她查询她的财产实情，她就抓住这个机会，将她财产的一部分委托给代管财产的人们，什么也不让他知道，所以他是得不到手的。而只是剩下的那一部分，他也觉得很满意了。

她的确还是很富足的，她拿出来一千四百镑，全给了他。过了一段时间，她说出还有一笔钱，那是她留着自己用的，他应当很感谢她才是，因为这钱虽然不是他的，却可以省去她个人的费用。我要再加一句，她用了这种手段，弄得这个绅士不仅求婚的时候对她特别谦恭，此后在她活着的时候，也始终是个殷勤有礼的丈夫。我要劝告那些姑娘们，她们是自己把身份降低的，简直连个平常妻子的地位都得不到，说句公道话，平常妻子的地位本来就够低了。我说，她们是自己把身份降低，服服帖帖地去忍受一切不必要的耻辱，将来的许多苦痛都是自己招出来的。

所以这段叙述的目的就是让姑娘们明白，男人并不像她们所想的那样占着优势。虽然有时男人的确可以随便挑选我们，有些女人的确不要脸面，降低身价，很容易被人得到，可是假使男人想找一个值得娶的老婆，他们会觉得这种女人还是不易得到的。至于那些一招就到的女人却又有许多缺点，更显出这种不易到手的女人十分可贵，因此人们不爱那种容易成功的婚姻，知道一招即到的老婆是没有什么价值的。

女人们要保持自己的地位，让她们的所谓爱人明白，她们受人欺侮时是知道愤慨的，对于求婚者是不怕说个“不”字的。这样一来，一定会使女人得到她们爱人的尊重。他们毫无道理地侮辱我们，说女人的数目太多了。因为战争，航海，出外做生意及其他事情大大地减少了男人的数目，现在两性人数中间简直不成比例。可是我决不承认女人的数目有那么多，男人的数目就那么少，假使他们要我说出真话来，那么女人处在不利地位却是男人莫大的耻辱，完全是他们的耻辱。因为世风太坏了，男人都是那么淫荡，所以规矩的女人敢与他们来往的纯洁男人真是太少了，我们只能偶然碰到一两个女人敢去亲近的男子。

既然好男人这么缺乏，那么女人就更应当小心，因为我们怎么能够知道求婚人的真正性格呢？假使说既然如此女人就更应当随便些，那就等于说因为危险性大，所以我们更该率真从事，在我看来，这是荒谬的说法。

相反，女人被骗的可能性越大，就越有许多说不尽的理由应当慎重，应当退缩。假使姑娘们都考虑到这点，谨慎从事，她们一定能够揭穿一切欺骗。现在大多数人的性格实在经不起考查，只要姑娘们稍稍打听一下，就立刻能够分辨出好人和坏人，不至落到圈套里去。至于那些以为自己终身的安全不值得考虑，因为忍耐不住目前的状况，好像嘶叫着要赴战场的战马，急忙奔去结婚的女子，我对于她们是无话可说的，只把她们当作得了疯病的姑娘。我们要代她们祈祷，在我看来她们好像那些把全部产业卖出去买彩票的人们，在十万个空签里只有一个是有彩的。

没有一个懂事的男子会看轻一个女人，因为她拒绝了他第一次的求婚，或者因为不了解他的人品和性格而没有接受他的要求。相反，因为目下男子的身价日高，他会认为她是世上最柔弱的动物。总之，他一定看不起她的能力，一定认为她一生里只有这么一个机会，却是这样糊涂地立刻定了终身，把结婚当作去死一样，一跳跳到黑暗的深渊里去。

我希望女性对于这件事情要稍稍规矩一点，我想女人一生中最危险的时期是结婚的时期。这也只是因为我们缺乏勇气，恐怕终身嫁不出去，过那种可怕的生活，所谓老处女的生涯。我说这些恐惧是女人的陷阱，假使姑娘们能够克服这个恐惧，好好地干，不去委曲求全，（这件事同她们的幸福关系太密切了，实在不该马虎。）不像现在这样自愿让男人欺侮，她们做老处女的可能性就会小得多。即使因此她们出嫁得迟些，也会因为安全地结婚而得到补偿。那些碰到坏丈夫的女人往往嫁得太早，嫁给一个好丈夫的女人总不能说嫁得太迟。总之，残废和声名扫地的女人除外，世界上的女子假使她能够谨慎从事，迟早总能嫁得一个好丈夫的。假使她用自己去冒险，那么十之八九，她的一生就算毁了。

现在我要谈谈自己的事情了，那事情在当时的确是很难办的。从我的情况来看，一个好丈夫真是我当时最需要的，可是我看出降低身价让男人们很容易得到并不是个好办法。人们很快就会发现这个寡妇是没有产业的，说我没有产业那就等于将我的不利全说出来。受过良好的教育，长得标致，会说话，对人谦虚，态度可爱，人们所认为我性格上的一切好处——是否实在那又是一个问题——假使我缺乏了这阿堵物，全是无用的。总而言之，他们都说那个寡妇没有钱。

看到这种情形，我决定非迁居不可了，到人们不认得我的地方去，甚至于换一个名字，假使有这种需要的话。

我将这种意思告诉我的密友，这位船长夫人，她和船长的结合的确是靠我诚恳帮助的，所以她也愿意同样帮助我。我毫无顾虑地把我的境遇全告诉她。我的财产很少，前次事情结束的时候只有五百四十镑，此后还花去一些，所以我现在还剩下四百六十镑，一些十分华贵的衣服，一块金表，几颗并不很值钱的钻石，还有三四十镑没有卖出去的布料。

我这位亲爱忠实的朋友，船长夫人，很感激我帮她办成前面所说的那件事。她不仅仅是个靠得住的朋友，并且知道我的境遇不佳，手边有钱的时候，常常送我许多礼物，几乎等于维持我的日常费用，所以我自己没有用什么钱。最后她向我提出这个不幸的建议，那就是说，我们既然看出男人常常自以为配娶一个有钱的老婆，自己实在并没有什么财产，我们又何妨就用他们的办法来治一治他们呢，假使办得到，很可以骗一骗这些骗子。

总之，船长夫人向我提出这个建议，对我说假使我肯听她摆布，最后一定可以得到一个有钱的丈夫，使他没法子怪我没有资产。我表示我愿意完全听她的调度，将来关于这件事我的一言一行全要按着她的意思去做，我相信弄糟的时候，她会设法补救，她也说她敢完全负责。

她的第一步是叫我认她做表妹，到乡下她的一个亲戚家里去住，她告诉我怎样办，以后又带着她丈夫到乡下来拜访我。称我表姐，直到最后她的丈夫和她还非常热烈地邀请我同他们到城里去住，因为他们现在住的地方和从前大不相同了。第二步，她告诉她丈夫我至少有一千五百镑家资，还可以继承许多财产。

对她丈夫这样说已经足够了，用不着我这方面再弄什么玄虚。我只需坐着，静静地等那结果，因为邻人们即刻都知道住在船长家里的那位年轻寡妇是很有钱的，她最少有一千五百镑，或者还不止。这是船主亲口说的。假使有人向船主探询我的境况，他总是无疑地会承认这些话，虽然他对于这件事一点也不知道，只是他妻子对他这么说的。他以为这样承认是不碍事的，因为他真相信我很有钱，他觉得他妻子总不至于骗他。我既然得到了拥有厚资的名声，身旁立刻有了不少的赞美者，我可以随意选择一个男人，不管他们以为自己是多么稀罕，这件事很可以证明我前面所说的话。我的情形既然如此，虽然起先我需要一种巧妙的手腕，现在却用不着了，只需从他们这帮人里拣出一个最合于我目的的人。那就是说，一个最肯相信我拥有厚资的谣传，不去仔细调查的人。除非我找出一个这样的人，否则便是一事无成的，因为我的境遇实在经不起人们很多的调查。

我很容易就挑选出了我的男人，从他向我求婚的态度我判断出了他的性格。我使他一直向我发誓赌咒，说他爱我超过世上的任何女人，只要我肯嫁他，他就会心满意足。我却明白这都因为他相信我很富足，虽然关于这点我自己对他一字也没有提过。

这个人真是我所需要的男人，但是我却要试他到底，的确只有这样我才能得到安全。假使他现出退缩不前的神气，我就可以知道他是个穷光蛋，那么嫁给他我一定毁了，其倒霉的程度也和他娶我是一样的。可是假如我根本不去探问他的财产，这就等于让他来怀疑我的妆奁。所以第一步，我一有机会就假装怀疑他的诚恳，对他说，也许他是因为我的钱才向我求婚的。他听到这话就止住我，大声说他是出于至诚，但是我仍然装作不能置信的样子。

一天早上他脱下他的钻石指环，在我房里的玻璃窗上写出这句诗：





我爱你，我爱的只是你。





我念了这句诗，请他将指环借我，就在下面写出这样一句：





在求婚时刻谁都这样说。





他拿回他的指环，又写出一句：





只有道德才是一笔财产。





我又向他借来，写在下面：





可是钱财就是道德，金子等于命运。





他看我这么敏捷地还嘴，怒气冲冲，对我说他一定要战胜我，就写出底下这一句：





我瞧不起你的金子，然而我的确爱你。





我在最后一句诗里，将我这事的成败付诸一掷，这是你们可以看得出的，因为我大胆地在他最后这一句诗下面写出——





我很穷，让我们看看你到底是多么诚恳。





这是我可怜的真实境况，他信不信我这句话，我是不知道的，我猜他是不相信的。然而他却跑到我的面前，双手抱住我，很亲切地吻我，以一种说不出的爱情紧紧地拥抱着我，一直到他叫我拿笔和墨水给他，说他的热情沸滚，不耐烦缓慢地写在这块玻璃上，却拿出一张纸来，又写下去：





做我的妻子吧，不管你是多么穷困。





我用他的笔立刻接着写：





可是你心里希望我说的是个大谎。





他说我这样冤枉他，真是太残忍了，并且逼得他免不了要反驳我的话，因此就有亏于礼貌，这又和他的爱情相冲突。我既是不知不觉地引他乱写出这许多诗句，他求我不要叫他忽然停住，所以他又写：





让爱情做我们辩论的题目。





我也写：





她既没有什么憎恶，也不能说是漠然无情。





他认为这是一种恩惠，于是放下武器，他的笔。我说他认为这是一种恩惠，假使他晓得全部真相的话，这真可以说是大大的恩惠。然而他相信了我这句话，认为我是愿意让他继续进行下去。我的确应该这样去鼓励他，因为他是我所看到的脾气最好、最快乐的男人，我自己常常想，欺骗这么好的一个男人是多么大的罪过。但是我的穷困逼着我去找一个合于我的境遇的安身之所，这可以做我欺骗的借口。他对于我的爱情同他温和的性情虽然使我有点不忍这样蒙骗他，但是因此也绝对可以想到他对于将来的失望不会那么痛心，不像烈火般的脾气那种坏东西，什么好处也没有。只有那种烈性，刚好将一个女子弄得终身受苦。

虽然我常这样同他开玩笑（他以为是玩笑），说我是多么穷，可是当他发现这是真话的时候，也没有法子来责备我，因为不管他是说笑话还是出于诚意，他总宣布他娶我并不在乎我很穷的。所以，总而言之，我把他抓住了。虽然以后他会说他受了骗，但是他绝不能够说我骗了他。

从此以后，他紧紧地追我，我知道现在用不着再怕丢失他了，就装出冷淡的样子，假使我不慎重些，绝不肯装得这么久。但是想到将来我不得不将自己的情形告诉他的时候，这种小心和冷淡的态度会使我占不少便宜的。我做得更小心，因为我看出他从我这种态度里猜到，他真该这样猜，我不是更有钱，便是更有主意，所以总是这样不肯轻易冒险的。

有一天我不客气地对他说，固然他给我一个爱人的尊重，就是说，他不去调查我的财产就愿意娶我，所以我也要给他相当的报答，就是在合理范围之内，我尽量不去探问他的情形，但是我希望他肯让我问他几个问题，回答与否随他的便，即使他一个字也不回答，我也不会生气。一个问题是关于我们的生活方式和居住地方，因为我听说他在弗吉尼亚有一大块新开垦的田地，我告诉他我是不愿迁到那里去的。

从这次谈话以后，他自愿让我知道他的一切事情，坦白地告诉我他的境况，因此我了解了他的确是很富足的。不过他的大部分产业是三块新开垦的土地，在弗吉尼亚，可以赚不少的钱，每年大概可以有三百金镑左右，但是假如他自己住在那里，每年的收入会增加四倍。“好吧，”我想，“你爱什么时候带我去就带我去吧，虽然我不肯先对你说这话。”

我拼命和他开玩笑，说他在弗吉尼亚会变成怎样的形象，但是我看凡是我所希望的，他没有一件不愿意做，尽管看我瞧不起他的田地，他好像有些不高兴，所以我又换了一个题目。我告诉他我很有理由不去那里住，因为假使他的田地在那里是这么值钱，我自己却没有一份财产，陪嫁据说每年有一千二百镑收入的绅士。

他说，他并不问我有多少财产。他一开头就这样告诉我过，现在自然要遵守他的诺言。但是不管怎样，他请我放心，他决不会让我陪他到弗吉尼亚去的，他自己一个人也不会去。除非我十分愿意，自己高兴和他同去。

你们当然晓得，这些话正合我的心愿，真的，没有一件事不是很如意的。一直到这个时候，我始终是抱着一种冷淡态度，他常常觉得纳闷，后来就更纳闷，但是只有这样才能够让他继续向我求婚。我说这件事只是让小姐们知道，就是因为我们缺乏勇气，不敢装出冷淡的样子，才使我们女性这样被人轻视，结果才像现在受到这样不公平的待遇。假使她们敢冒险，情愿有时失去一个自命不凡的纨绔子弟，她们一定会受到人们的重视，求婚的人数也会增多。即使我老实讲出我这笔嫁妆的情况，他原来期望我拥有一千五百镑，而我所有的却还不到五百镑，可是我已经将他钩得很紧，把他玩弄得很久，我深深知道不管我的境遇坏到什么地步，他总是要娶我的。的确当他知道了我的实情时，并不十分惊讶，因为他连一句责备我的话都不能够说，我始终抱着冷淡的态度，他无话可说，只好说他起先以为我有更多的财产，但是既然没有那么多，他也不后悔这个婚约。不过他不能够像他从前所想的那样很好地供给我。

总之，我们结婚了，我告诉你们，对我来说，嫁了这个人，真是万分幸运。因为他是从古以来女人所曾遇到的脾气最好的人，但是他的境遇并不像我所想象的那样好，同样地，他娶了我也没有像他所希望的那样增加了他的财富。

我们结婚以后，我很觉为难，不好将我所有的小小家产交给他，让他看出我只有这一点。但是这又是免不了的，所以有一天当我们两人独自在一起的时候，我就乘机用简单的话对他说了出来。“我亲爱的，”我说，“我们已经结婚两个礼拜了，你娶了妻子，到底得了什么东西没有，现在你该知道了？”

“这尽可以随你的便，我亲爱的，”他说，“我得到一个我所爱的人儿做妻子，已经是很满意了，我并没有怎样麻烦你，”他说，“去探问你的情形。”

“这是真的，”我说，“但是关于这件事我心里很为难，简直不知道怎么办好。”

“有什么为难，我亲爱的？”他说。

“这事，”我说，“使我觉得有些难过，你会觉得更难过的。我听说某某船长（指我朋友的丈夫）告诉你我有许多财产，我自己从来没有这样说过，我敢说我绝没有让他这样来对你造谣。”

“船长，”他说“，也许曾经对我这样说过，但是这又有什么关系呢？假使你没有那么多的财产，那是他撒谎，可是你却从来没有向我说过你有多少东西，所以即便你一无所有，我还是没有理由责备你的。”

“你这话说得很公平，”我说，“很慷慨，因此想到自己只有这么一点东西更加使我难过。”

“你的财产越少，我亲爱的，”他说，“我俩的境遇就越不好了，但是我希望你所以难过并不是因为怕我看到你没有妆奁，会待你不好。不会的，不会的，假使你什么也没有，你就坦白地告诉我，我也许会向船长说，他骗了我了，但是我绝不能说你骗了我什么，因为你不是写给我看，说你很穷吗？所以我应当想到你是穷的。”

“我亲爱的，”我说，“我很高兴在结婚以前没有骗你。假使结婚以后，我瞒着你，那并不碍事。我是穷，这是千真万确的事，但是也没有穷到什么都没有。”我接着就拿出几张银行票据给他，差不多有一百六十镑。“这总算是一点东西，我亲爱的，”我说，“当然，这还不是我所有的全部。”

我用前面所说的办法，让他几乎以为我什么也没有，所以这笔钱，虽然数目微小，他却加倍地欢迎。他自认这是出乎他的意料的，他从我的谈话里，自然也知道我的漂亮衣服，金表和一两个钻石指环也都是我自己的财产。

我使他因为得了这一百六十镑心里高兴了两三天，然后，有一天我走出去，好像是取钱的样子，我又带了一百个金镑回家交给他，告诉他这又是一点妆奁。简单说起来，差不多过了一个星期，我又交给他一百八十镑和大约值六十镑的细麻布，我告诉他这些布和前回我给他的一百金镑是一笔六百镑债务的折偿，一镑钱只拿回来五个多先令，而那些布又是估得超过实在的价值的。

“现在，我亲爱的，”我对他说，“我很抱歉地告诉你，我所有的都在这里了，我已经把我的全部财产给你了。”我说，假使那个借去我六百镑钱的人没有欺骗我，我可以带来一千镑给他，但是实情既是如此，我对他总算是忠实，没有私下存了什么，可是假使我的财产更多些，他也能够完全得到。

他起先非常恐慌，只怕什么也得不到，这时看到我的态度，又看到这笔钱，就高高兴兴地接受了。这样，我假装有一大笔财产，扮出有钱的样子，引诱一个男人来娶我的这段诡计就算完结了。说到这里，我以为这个手段是女人最大的一种冒险，结果往往是会受到男人的虐待的。

我的丈夫，说句公道话，是个性情无限温和的人，但是他绝不是个傻子。他看到他的收入不适合于他所想象的那种生活，（他以为我会带来一大笔财产的），对于弗吉尼亚田产的收入又很感失望，他好几回露出他想回到弗吉尼亚，住在他自己田地上的意思，常常夸耀那里的生活多么低廉，多么丰富，多么有趣。

我立刻明白了他这话的本意。有一天早晨我坦白地跟他谈论，告诉他我懂他的意思。我看出他的产业在这么远的地方，实在没有多大出息，如果自己住在那里，情形就会不同。我看出他愿意到那里去住，我还说，我晓得他对妻子已经失望了，我既然看到他的期望没有如愿，为了赔偿他，我最少也要表示我很愿意跟他到弗吉尼亚去，在那里住下。

我提出这个建议后，他对我说了许多温柔的话。他告诉我，虽然他那得到一大笔财产的希望落空了，对于妻子他却没有失望。我对他已经尽了做妻子的义务，这个提议对他这么体贴，他心中的感激是无法表达的。

简单说来，我们同意远离。他告诉我他在那里有一所很好的房子，布置也很好，他的母亲还活着，住在那所房子里，还有一个姊妹，这是他唯一的亲戚了。他一到那里，他母亲就搬到另外一所房子去住，她在世那所房子是她的，她死后就归他。所以我可以有整整的一所房子，后来的情形的确像他所说的那样。

在我们所乘的那只船上，我们装了大批的家具，预备自己家里用，好多的细麻布同其他日用必需品，还有能卖的不少货物。这样，我们就出发了。

将我们漫长的、危险的海行详细叙述出来，是超乎我的能力的。我没有记日记，我丈夫也没有记。我所能说的只是，经过一次可怕的旅行，曾经两次被可畏的暴风雨吓住了，一次被更可怕的东西吓住了，我是指一群海盗来到了船上，差不多把我们的粮食全拿去了。还有一件事，对我说来那是最可怕的，就是他们曾经要把我的丈夫带走，经我再三恳求，他们才肯把他留下——总之经过这一切可怕的事情以后，我们终于到达了弗吉尼亚的约克河，来到我们的新垦地。我丈夫的母亲以最高的慈爱和热情欢迎了我们。

我们在这里一块儿住下了，我的婆婆由于我的恳求仍然住在这里，因为这个婆婆太好了，我实在舍不得与她分开。我的丈夫还是起先那个样子，我自以为是世上最快乐的人，直到一件古怪可怕的事情立刻把这一切幸福一笔勾销，使我陷于世界上最不愉快的处境。

我婆婆是个非常乐观，性情非常温和的老妇人——我可以说她是老妇人，因为她的儿子已经三十多岁了。我说她是个很有趣味的好伴侣，常常替我解闷，特别是讲了许多关于我们现在居住的这个地方和居民的故事来给我开心。

在这些故事里，她常常告诉我这殖民地的居民大部分都是在很恶劣的环境里从英国到这里来的。大概说起来，他们分为两类：第一类是被船主带来卖给人家当仆人；第二类是被判了死罪以后流放到这里的。

“他们到了这里，”她说，“我们平等看待他们。地主把他们买来，他们同样在田地里做工，做到他们服役的年限完结为止。年限满了以后，”她说，“他们还可以得到一种鼓励，那就是可以替自己耕种，因为国家可以分给他们若干亩土地。他们就去做工，把那块土地垦好，加上肥料，然后再种上烟草和谷类，作为自用。商人愿意把农具和其他日用必需品先卖给他们，拿他们将来的收成做折押，所以他们每年老是比前一年多种一些地，所以他们就用将来的收成先买他们所需要的一切东西。”

“所以，孩子，”她说，“许多新门里的犯人，都变成了大人物了。我们这里有好几位治安官，团练长以及好多城里的知事都是手上打过烙印的。”

她这样讲的时候，谈到她自己的那段经历，就停住了，显出很和蔼很信得过我的神气，告诉我她自己是第二类的居民。她是官厅送来的，有一件案子她太冒险了，所以成了个犯人。“这里是那标记，孩子，”她说，一面脱下她的手套，“你看这里，”她说着翻过她的手掌，指给我看一个美丽白皙的手腕同手掌，但是在掌心却打着一个烙印，犯人们都是这样子的。

这段故事使我很感动，但是我婆婆含笑说道：“你用不着把这类事情看得很奇怪，女儿，我不是告诉过你，这里有几个最好的人手上也打了烙印，他们也不以为耻吗？我们这里的某某少校，”她说，“从前是个著名的扒手。我们这里的巴法官，从前是个窃店货的人，他们两个都是手上打了烙印的。我还能说出好几个像他们这样的人来。”

我们常常谈这一类的话题，她还给我举了许多同样的例子。有一天她正讲前几星期才流放来的一个犯人的故事的时候，我用一种亲密的态度请她告诉我一些她自己的过去，她就非常坦白诚恳地告诉了我。她说她年轻的时候在伦敦怎样与坏人结交，那是由于她母亲常常派她送吃的东西给她的新门监狱里的一个亲戚，这个亲戚快要饿死了，后来判处死刑，但是托称肚里有胎，暂缓处决，以后就死在狱中了。

说到这里，我婆婆就缕述了一大段关于那个可怕的地方的一切坏事。“孩子，”我婆婆说，“也许你不大晓得这些事，或者，也许你简直没有听过，但是你尽可以相信，”她说，“我们全都知道这个新门监狱比全国所有的恶棍俱乐部同会党造就出更多的盗贼和流氓来。这块殖民地一半的居民，”我婆婆说，“都是从这倒霉的地方来的。”

说到这里，她接着谈她自己的过去，讲得这么久，又讲得这么详细，我开始觉得很不安。但是说到一个该讲出她的名字的地方，我想我要晕倒在那里了。她看出我有些失常的样子，问我有什么不舒服，哪里觉得难受。我告诉她她所述的凄凉的故事同她所经历的可怕事情使我太感动了，使我不禁伤感起来，我求她不要再讲这些了。“怎么，我亲爱的，”她很慈爱地说，“这些事哪里用得着使你难过？这些遭遇是在你出世以前好久的事情，现在我一点也不觉得难过。不，回忆到这些事情，我还觉得高兴，因为由于这些事我才到这个地方来的。”然后她就告诉我她怎样落到一个好人家里，在那里她的行为是很规矩的，她的主母死后，她主人把她娶来，她就生下了我的丈夫和他的妹妹。她丈夫死后，靠着她的勤勉和善于经营，将那新开垦的土地改良到这种地步，所以大部分的地产是她得来的，不是她丈夫本来有的，因为她已当了十六年的寡妇了。

我很不经心地听着这段历史，因为我很想走开，去发泄一下我的悲情。想到这个婆婆的的确确是我自己的母亲，我跟我自己的兄弟已经生了两个孩子，现在又快生第三个了，每天还是和他一起睡觉，我心中是怎样的悲哀，大家是很容易想到的。

我现在是世界上最不幸的女人了。唉！假使从没有人把这段过去告诉我，那么一切还会很好地继续下去。同我丈夫一起睡觉也不能算是罪恶，因为关于这件事我一点也不晓得。

我现在心上有这么重的一个东西压着，所以老是坐卧不宁。把这事说出来，我觉得没有什么意思，隐藏在心里，又几乎是不可能的。不，我相信我会在睡梦中说到这件事，把这事告诉我丈夫，不管我愿意不愿意。假使我说出了这件事，最少我也该料到，我会失去我的丈夫，因为他是个很知礼很诚实的人。当他知道了我原来是他的姐姐以后，决不肯再继续做我的丈夫，所以我烦恼到了极点。

让任何人来判断一下摆在我面前的难题吧。我离开了家乡，住在很远的地方，回国对于我是办不到的。我生活很好，但是却处在一种绝难忍受的环境里。假使我将自己的身世对我婆婆说出，却又不容易使她相信一切的细节，而我又没有法子可以去证明。反之，假使她问我或者怀疑我，我也就完了，因为只要对于这件事略加忖度就足以立刻把我同我丈夫分开，同时也不能获得我婆婆或者我丈夫的心。所以一面是使他们惊愕，一面是我居于不稳定的地位，我总是免不了毁灭的。

那时，我的的确确相信了那件事，所以我自认是生活在公开的乱伦同苟合的状况之中，然而却装出一个正当妻子的面貌。虽然我与这件事的罪恶无关，可是那种举动却是人性所难忍受的，甚至使我厌恶我的丈夫。

然而，经过了最冷静的考虑之后，我认为把它完全隐藏起来，既不告诉我婆婆也不告诉我丈夫，这是绝对必要的。这样，我在最苦闷的心情下又过了三年。

在这期间，我婆婆常常告诉我她从前冒险的故事，然而那绝不是我所爱听的。因为照她所说的，虽然她没有用明白的字眼告诉我，可是我能够感觉到，再加上听了我最初的保姆所说的，在她年轻的时候，既是个淫妇，又是个盗贼。但是我的确相信她后来诚恳地忏悔过这两件事，她那时是个非常虔敬、庄严又有信仰的女人了。

不管那时她的生活怎样，我的生活却真使我感到不安。因为我是生活在，像我在前面所说的，最坏的一种苟合状态之下，我不能希望有什么好结果，所以真的没有好结果，我一切可能的幸福全消磨去了，消灭在痛苦和破毁之中。这的确还应过些时候才弄到这个地步，但是我不明白受了什么厄运的支配，此后我们的一切事情都变糟了。最糟的是我丈夫很奇怪地渐渐变成另外一种人，变得刚愎，嫉妒而残忍。他的态度越是无理，我就越不能忍受。这种情况继续下去，最后我们彼此相处得很不好，我就要他履行他的诺言，那是我同意和他同离英国的时候他情愿答应我的，那就是说，假使我觉得那地方对我不合适，或者我不愿住在那里，我可以随意回到英国来，不过要在前一年告诉他，好让他去安顿他的事情。

说到我现在要他兑现他的诺言，我必须承认，我并不是用最殷勤的话说的，我硬说他待我不好，我离开了我的朋友，又不能替自己抱不平，他没有理由地妒忌，我同人交友既是毫无可责之处，他又没有其他的借口，而回到英国去倒可以使他去掉一切妒忌的机会。

我这样坚决地提出这个要求，他终于不得不明白答复，到底是履行他对我的诺言还是置之不理。尽管他用尽一切手段，叫他母亲和别人来劝我改变决心，我仍旧这样坚持。真的，根本的原因是在我心里，他一切的努力全然无效，因为我的心已经和他疏远了。一想到和他同睡，我就感到厌恶，因此用有病和不舒服等等借口，来阻止他和我接触，怕的是又要怀孕，那样必定会阻止，至少也会耽搁我回英国。

可是最后我使他太生气了，他就下了一种鲁莽的、最不幸的决心，总之，我不能到英国去。虽然他曾经许诺过我，可是叫他履行诺言算是一件无理的事。这会毁坏了他的事情，搅乱了他的全家，几乎等于毁了他在世界上的地位。所以我不该叫他履行这个诺言，世界上任何一个看重家庭和丈夫的利益的妻子都不会坚持。

这又把我陷在里面了，因为当我冷静地考虑这事的时候，看到我丈夫实在是怎样的一个人！大体上是个勤勉小心的人，他又完全不知道他所处的可怕环境，我实在不得不承认我的提议是非常不合理的，是任何关心家庭幸福的妻子所不该提的。

但是我的不满却是另外一种性质的，我不再把他看成一个丈夫，而看成一个近亲，我自己母亲的儿子。我决定无论如何要脱离他，但是用什么法子我却不知道。

关于我们女性，恶毒的世界说道：“假使我们一心想做一件事，那是无法使我们改变我们的决心的。”总之，我不停地想种种法子，来达到我这个旅行的目的，最后我和丈夫闹到那种地步，竟提议不要他和我同去。这话他听了很生气，他不仅骂我是个无情的妻子，而且是个违背天理的母亲。他问我，想到撇下这两个孩子（因为一个已经死了），使他们失去母亲，母子再不能相见，为什么不觉得可怕。真的，假使一切情形都很顺利，我绝不会干这种事，但是目前再也看不见他们，甚至连他本人，倒是我的真正愿望。至于违背天理这个罪状，我自己倒是很容易辩解的，我们整个的关系就是世界上最违背天理的事。

然而，我不能够使我丈夫的态度有任何改变。他既不和我同去，也不肯让我一个人离开。而不得到他的同意，我是一步也不能离开的，这是任何晓得我们那地方的法律的人都知道得很清楚的。

关于这件事，我们家庭里发生了许多次的口角，这些口角逐渐发展到危险的程度。因为我在感情上既然对他十分冷淡，所以我说话也不小心，有时竟用些刺激的言辞，总之，我想尽一切办法让他同我分离，那是我最希望的。

他恨我的态度，真的，他也应该恨，因为最后我竟不肯和他同床。每回口角都跟他吵到极点，有一次他对我说他认为我是疯了，假使我不改变我的行为，他要把我送去医治，那就是说，送到疯人院里去。我对他说他应当看出，我一点都没有疯，他或者其他的恶棍都没有权利来谋杀我。说实在的，听说要把我送到疯人院里去，我当时的确很害怕，因为这样一来立刻会丧失一切说出真话的可能性，那时任何人都不会相信我的真话了。

所以我就下了决心，不管发生什么结果，总得把我的全部事实说出来。但是用什么法子说出，或者向谁说出，却是个难以解决的困难。有一次我同我丈夫又吵了起来，吵得那样激烈，我几乎想把实话向他当面说出。不过我虽然没有把细节讲出来，却说了许多话，弄得他万分莫名其妙，最后终于说出了全部事实。

他起先冷静地劝我不必这么坚决要到英国去，我就和他争辩，于是像我们平日口角的情形一样，一句紧一句地争吵起来。他说我没有把他当作自己的丈夫看待，对于孩子来说，没有把自己当作一个母亲。总而言之，我不配被人当作妻子对待。他对我用尽了一切可能的办法，他用尽做丈夫的或者一个基督教徒的一切仁慈和冷静的态度来跟我辩论，而我却用这么恶毒的态度对待他，我待他像一条狗，而不像一个人！像个最可鄙视的生人，而不像个丈夫。他很不愿用粗暴的态度待我，但是现在看来有这种必要，将来他将被迫采取那种办法，使我不得不尽我的义务。

我的愤怒真是达到极点了，再也不能更愤怒了。我对他说，不管他用什么办法，我都同样地看不起他。至于我回英国的事，我已经下定了决心。他说我待他不像丈夫，我对小孩没尽做母亲的义务，这里面也许有些他现在所不了解的原因。不过我觉得应该告诉他，他既不是我合法的丈夫，他们也不是我合法的子女，我有理由把他们看成这样。

我承认我说出这些话以后，我觉得他很可怜，因为他脸色变得像死人一样的灰白，像雷打了似的，呆呆地站在那里，有一两次我以为他要晕倒下去。总之，他有点像中风，发抖，一阵汗或者汗珠从他脸上流下来，然而他却冷得像块泥土。所以我只好跑去拿些东西来把他治活。他醒来的时候，觉得恶心，呕吐了，过了一会儿我把他放在床上，第二天早上他就发起高烧来。

可是他的烧退了，他痊愈了，虽然很慢，当他好些的时候，他对我说我的舌头给了他一个致命伤，他说在他请我解释之前，先要问我一句话。我打断了他的话，告诉他，我说了这许多话，觉得很懊悔，因为我看出这使他感到很大的不安，但是我请他不要再作什么解释，因为那只有把事情弄得更糟。

这更增加了他的焦急，使他窘到忍无可忍的程度。因为他现在开始怀疑还有一些秘密没有说出，但是一点也猜不到究竟是什么。环绕在他脑际的只是我有另外一个丈夫还活着，但是我请他放心，这对于我们的事是毫无关系的。真的，我那个丈夫，对我说来已经算是死了，他也曾经让我把他当成死去的一样，所以对于这点我倒丝毫没有感到不安。

但是现在我却看出这事已经演变到不能再隐瞒下去的地步，我丈夫给我一个机会来解脱我心中的秘密，使我感到很愉快。有三四个星期他老是苦苦地劝我，但是依然无效，他只让我告诉他我讲这些话只是出于愤怒，有意气他一下，还是真有什么隐情，但是我仍然坚持下去，一句话也不解释，除非他先答应让我到英国去。他说，只要他活一天，他是绝不肯答应的。在我这方面，假使我愿意的话，我就有办法让他同意我去——不，让他恳求我去。这更增加了他的好奇心，使他啰啰唆唆地向我恳求。

最后他把这全部经过告诉他的母亲，叫他母亲来套出这个秘密，她对于我真是用尽她的本领，但是我立刻使她住了口。告诉她这全部的秘密全在她自己身上，只是出于对她的尊敬，才把这事隐藏起来。总之，我不能再多说了，所以恳求她别再坚持要我说出。

听到这个暗示，她吓得说不出话来了，不知道怎么说，怎么想才好。只得把这个推测丢在一边，以为是我的一种策略。继续为她儿子向我啰唆，假使办得到，一定要排解我们两人中间的不和。关于这事，我告诉她，这虽是一个好办法，但这是不能成功的。假使我对她说出了她想知道的真情，她就会承认那是办不到的，也不希望能够成功了。最后我似乎被她的恳求打动了，告诉她我敢对她说出一个极其重要的秘密，她将立刻承认的确是事实。假使她肯严肃地保证在没有得到我的许可以前不把这事告诉她的儿子，我就向她吐露这个秘密。

迟疑了好久她才答应了这个条件，因为与其不能听到那个秘密，不如答应这个条件。我先说了许多其他的话，然后才开始告诉她全部的事实。我先告诉她，因为她说出了自己的过去和她在伦敦时所用的名字因而引起了我和她儿子的决裂。就是她看见我现出惊奇的样子的那次。然后我告诉她我的过去和我的名字，用她所不能否认的其他证据使她确信我不是别人，恰恰是她自己的孩子，在新门监狱里从她身上生下来的女儿。就是因为怀在她肚里才使她免上绞架的那个女儿，就是当她被流放的时候交给某人抚养的那个女儿。

她的惊讶实在是笔墨所不能形容的。她不愿相信这段故事，也不愿想起那些细节，因为她立刻料到，这件事情一经证实，家庭里必定引起混乱。但是一切情形同她自己所告诉我的恰恰相合，那些事情假使她未曾告诉过我，或者她会愿意否认的，但是她已经堵住了自己的嘴。她毫无办法，只好搂着我的脖子，吻我，伏在我身上哭得很厉害，很久说不出一句话来。最后她忽然说道：“不幸的孩子！”她说，“什么厄运把你带到这里来？而且在我儿子怀里！可怕的女孩！”她说，“唉，我们全都完了！嫁了你自己的兄弟！生了三个孩子，两个活着，都是同样的血统！我的儿子和我的女儿睡在一起做夫妻！真是混乱，真是烦恼！悲惨的家庭！我们将变成什么样子？有什么可说？有什么办法呢？”她这样说了许久。我也没有说话的能力了，即使我有，也不知道说什么好，因为句句话都伤到我的内心。这是我们第一次带着惊讶的心情分开的，虽然我婆婆比我更惊讶，因为这对她比对我更是一件新闻。可是，她在分别的时候又答应我，这事对她儿子一字不提，以后我们还要再谈。

你们可以想到，过了不久，我们又第二次谈论这事。她好像很想忘掉她自己告诉我的事实，或者以为我也忘记了一些细节，便开始把那段故事加以更改和删削，重新叙述了一遍。但是我提醒她很多我以为她忘了的事情，这些事与整个事实恰恰相合，使她无法避开原来的事实。于是她便开始狂热地呼喊并且感叹她的严酷的厄运。她的感叹稍过，我们又开始仔细谈判，商议在把这事告诉我丈夫之前，先应当怎么办。但是我们的商议会有什么结果呢？我们两人都想不出办法，也不知道怎样才能稳妥地把这事告诉我的丈夫。至于他听到这个消息会是怎样的感觉，或者他对这事会采取什么办法，都无法判断，无法预测。如果他不能控制自己，把这事宣扬出来，那么很容易想到我们全家就完了。我母亲和我都要丢尽脸面，如果他利用法律给予他的权利，便可以很轻蔑地把我丢开，让我去起诉要回我所有的一点财产，也许把那点财产全花在诉讼上面，然后去当叫花子。孩子也会毁了，因为对于他的任何家产都会丧失继承权。所以在几个月以后我也许会看到他在另一个妻子的怀里。而我却变成世界上最可怜的人。

我母亲和我同样地想到这点，总之，我们不知道怎么办好。过了些时候我们的主意更明确了，但又带来了一种新的不幸：我母亲的意见和我的很不相同，真是太不一致了。她的意见是让我将这整个事实全部隐藏起来，继续同他住在一起，把他当作丈夫看待，等到有适当的机会再将这事挑明。当下她又极力拉拢我们和好如初，恢复我们共同的安乐和家庭的和睦。我们仍可像从前一样地睡在一处，让整个事情仍然保持秘密。“因为，孩子，”她说，“假使这事泄露出来，我俩就都毁了。”

为了鼓励我这样做，她又答应我能够过安乐的生活，在她临死的时候，一定尽量给我留下一笔钱，而且说明是给我的，同我丈夫不相干。即使这事后来泄露了，我也能够自立，不至于受他的欺侮。

这个提议虽然是我母亲的一番好意，但是同我的看法太不相同了，我所想的却是走另外一条大不相同的路。

至于将这事藏在我们自己的心里，让一切还是同从前一样，我告诉她这是办不到的。我问她，我同自己的兄弟同床，怎么能受得了？其次，我对她说，她活在人世的时候，揭露这件事，对我是很有好处的，当她承认我是她的女儿的时候，而且她有使人满意的理由，说我是她的女儿，别人是无法置疑的。但是假使在这事被发觉之前，她死去了，我将被看作是个没有廉耻的东西，假造出这么一回事，来同我丈夫脱离关系，或者被认为发狂，或者神经错乱。我又告诉她，他曾经怎样恐吓我，说要把我送到疯人院里去，我为这话曾怎样担心，以及这句话怎样逼得我不能不把事实告诉她。

根据这些理由，我告诉她，关于这件事，我经过最严肃的考虑之后，想出了这个主意，我希望得到她的同意。那是我们两人意见的一种折中办法，就是说，她要尽力劝她儿子答应我回英国去，而且给我一笔充足的钱，拿些货物让我带走，或者给我汇票都行，做我在那里的赡养费，一面还时时提醒他将来该去那里找我。

我走后，那时她就要保持冷静，应用自己的判断力渐渐把这事告诉他，使他不至于觉得惊讶，而忽然动了激情，做出不法的事来。她还要当心阻止他丢掉孩子不管，或者再去娶亲，除非他确实听到我的死讯。

这是我的计划，我的理由是很充足的。为了这事，我的心确实离开了他。真的，作为丈夫，我恨得他要死，要消除我对他的极深的厌恶，是办不到的。同时，这种违法的、乱伦的生活，再加上那种厌恶的感觉，使我觉得和他同居是世界上最难忍受的事情。这种厌恶的感觉曾经达到那样高的程度，以至有时我真认为让他向我加诸那样的行为，和抱着一只狗胡闹差不多，因此我不能忍受再和他同床共枕。我不能说我把这事闹到这步田地，而却没有决定把真相告诉他的做法是对的，但是我只不过说出我过去的实情，而不是什么对不对的问题。

我母亲和我一直意见分歧，要使我们的主张一致，那是办不到的。我们为这事争辩了好多次，但是谁也不能放弃自己的主张，谁也说服不了谁。

我认为同我的亲兄弟睡在一起实在没法忍受，她认为要让她儿子答应我到英国去是办不到的。我们这样犹豫未决，一直拖延下去，虽然没有因为意见不合到吵架的地步，但是却不能决定怎样来解决我们之间的意见分歧。

最后我决定走一条险路，把我的主意告诉我母亲，总而言之，那就是我要亲自把这事告诉他。我母亲一想到这种办法，就吓坏了。但是我叫她放心，我告诉她我将用我一切的手段和耐心趁他高兴的时候，渐渐地，缓和地把这事告诉他。我对她说，假使我能够装出一副假君子的面貌，装出对他有很深的爱情，我的一切计划都会成功，大家就会好好协商，同意彼此分离。因为虽然作为一个丈夫，我不能爱他，作为一个兄弟，我却还是很爱他的。

这些日子他老是请我母亲，如果可能的话，问我那句可怕的话是什么意思，那句话我在前面已经说过了，就是我不是他合法的妻子，我的孩子也不是他合法的孩子。我母亲敷衍他，说她不能让我做出什么解释，只看到我烦闷，她希望能够早些知道为什么。当下她还真诚地劝他要好好地待我，用他以往那种亲爱的态度去换得我的爱情。她又告诉他，他的恐吓，说要把我送到疯人院里去，几乎把我吓死，因此忠告他无论如何总不能使一个女人走投无路。

他答应要改变自己的态度，叫她请我相信，他还像从前一样地爱我，不管当他发怒的时候曾经说过什么，他并没有要把我送到疯人院里去的意思。他还请我母亲也同样地劝慰我，希望我们的感情能恢复，像以往一样地生活下去。

我立刻看出这次谈判很有效力。我丈夫的行为随之变了样，他对于我简直变了一个人，每次对我都是过于慈爱过于殷勤。我也不能不对他的好意有些报答，但是我只能尽力去做，仍旧表现出一种不自然的态度，因为没有别的事能比他的拥抱更使我惊慌，那种怕怀孕的恐惧使我怕得发狂。这就使我看出，不能再迟延，得立刻得把这事情向他挑明，这样做绝对必要，然而我却是用尽一切的小心和含蓄说出这事的。

他对我维持着这种改变了的态度将近一个月了，我们开始过一种新生活。假使我自己愿意这样下去，我相信我们存在一天，就可以这样生活一天。一个黄昏，我们在花园进门的地方当作小亭子用的帐幕下，很和谐地坐着聊天。他说得很高兴，很适意，对我说了好多温柔的话，说我们现在和好多么快乐，过去不和怎样痛苦，看到我们有希望不再争吵，他感到非常满意，等等。

我深深地叹一口气，告诉他世界上没有一个人比我们过去和好相处的时候更觉得愉快，也没有一个人比我们关系破裂的时候更感到悲伤。但是我觉得很抱歉，我要告诉他，关于我们之间的事有一个不幸的情形，紧紧地系在我的心上，我又不知道怎样对他说穿，这使我感到非常悲惨，把其他的一切快乐全夺去了。他求我告诉他是什么事。我告诉他，不知怎样办好，把这事隐藏起来，不让他知道，只有我一个人烦恼。但是若使他也知道了，我俩都将感到烦恼。所以，让他茫然一无所知，倒是最好的办法，只是为了这个缘故，我才保守了秘密，不让他知道。这种秘密，我想，早晚会成为我毁灭的原因。

他听了这段话怎样的惊讶以及为了让我说出真相，怎样对我苦苦哀求，那是不能用言语形容的。他对我说，假使我将那件事隐藏起来，不让他知道，不能算是对他诚恳，不，不能算是对他忠实。我对他说，我也这样想，可是我不能说出来。他回想我从前对他说过的话，对我说，他希望这同我从前发怒时所说的话不相关，他已经决心忘掉那一切，认为这是个鲁莽的、被激怒了的人所说的气话。我对他说，我也愿意忘记这一切，但是那是办不到的，那印象太深了，我不能忘记，不可能忘记。

他于是告诉我，他决定在任何事情上不同我意见不合，所以关于这事他不再和我啰唆了，无论我做什么或者说什么他都决定不去反对，只求无论如何，不要妨碍我们的安宁和恩爱。

他这话使我感到莫大的刺激，因为我正要他向我进一步地啰唆，那么可以逼迫我说出那个无法隐藏的事实。所以我坦白地告诉他，即使他不再向我啰唆，我也不见得高兴，虽然我不知道怎样回答他的要求。“但是，我亲爱的，”我说，“假使我将这事向你公开，你肯答应我什么条件？”

“世界上任何的条件，”他说，“只要你要求得合理。”“好，”我说，“来，你亲笔写下给我，如果你没有看出我有什么错处，或者跟未来的祸根有任何牵连，那么将来你就不要责备我，待我不好，伤害我，或者使我为了与我无关的事而受罪。”

“因为不是你的罪过而不去责备你，”他说，“这是世界上最合理的要求。给我一支笔和墨水。”他说。我于是跑进去，拿了笔、墨水和纸来，他照我所说的逐字写下了这个条件，然后签上他的名字。“好，”他说，“第二个条件是什么呢，我亲爱的？”

“呀，”我说，“第二个条件是，不要因为在我不知道这个秘密之前，而没有把这事告诉你而责备我。”

“这也很合理，”他说，“我很愿意。”他也把这个条件写下，签上他的名字。

“好，我亲爱的，”我说，“现在我只要和你再订一个条件，就是，这事除了你我之外，既然没有牵扯别人，除了你自己的母亲，就不要向世上任何人道破。我说出这个秘密之后，无论你采取什么办法，不要事先不让我知道，或者没得到我的同意，而在盛怒之下做出什么事来，伤害到我或者你的母亲，因为我和你同样的与这事有关，而且同样地无罪。”

这有点使他惊讶，他把这些话明确地写下来，但是再三读过之后，才签上名字，沉吟了好久，才说道：“伤害到我的母亲！伤害到你！这是什么神秘的事情？”然而，最后他仍然签了字。

“好吧，”我说，“我亲爱的，我不请你再写什么了，但是因为你将要听到或许是世界上任何家庭所未经历过的最出乎意料、最可怕的事情，所以我求你答应，听了这事以后，千万要镇静，千万不要慌乱。”

“我将尽量去做，”他说，“如果你不再拖延下去使我这样提心吊胆的话，因为你先说了这么多话，真把我吓坏了。”

“好，那么，”我说，“这就是那秘密：我从前在盛怒之下告诉过你，我不是你合法的妻子，我们的孩子也不是你合法的孩子，现在我要冷静地、诚恳地、怀着苦痛的心情告诉你，我是你的亲姊妹，你是我的亲兄弟，我们俩都是现在还活着、住在屋里的我们的母亲的儿女，她无法否认无法辩驳地承认这是事实。”

我看他的脸色变得灰白，显出蛮横的神气。我说，“你要记住你的诺言，千万不要慌乱。谁还能够比我说更多的话而使你心理上有所准备呢？”说完，我叫仆人来，给他拿了一小杯红酒（那是那地方通常喝的酒），因为他要晕倒过去了。当他恢复一点的时候，我对他说：“你要知道，这个事实需要很多的解释，所以，请你忍耐一下，镇静一下，把这事情的始末听完，我将尽量说得简短些。”然后，我就把认为必要的事实告诉了他，特别是我母亲怎样向我泄露这件事的经过。“那么，我亲爱的，”我说，“你知道我提出那些条件的原因了，我既不是，也不可能是这件事的主因，在这以前我一点也不知道。”

“你说出这事，我觉得很满意，”他说，“但是对于我来说，却是个极其可怕的消息。可是，我想出了一个彻底的补救办法，能把你的困难全部解决，又用不着你回到英国去。”

“那真是奇怪。”我说。

“不，不，”他说，“我会想办法，除了我以外，这里并没有谁能阻碍。”他说这话的时候现出有点神经错乱的样子，但是在那时我并没有害怕这话会成为事实，因为我相信，像人们常常说的，干那些事的人绝不谈那些事，谈那些事的人们绝不做那些事。

但是情况并没有发展到严重的程度，我却看他变得苦心焦思，愁闷万状，一言以蔽之，我以为他有些神经错乱。我极力说得他心平气和，极力喻他以理，使他对于处理这件事有计划。有时他会好起来，有点勇气谈论这事，但是这事在他心上的压力太重了，他竟两次想自杀，有一回他真的在上吊，要不是我母亲刚巧走进房里，他就会把自己吊死了。有个黑人仆人帮忙，她才把他救下来，使他苏醒。

我们家庭里的情形到了十分悲哀的地步。我对于他的怜惜使我以往对他的爱情复活了，我诚恳地设法用我所能表现的一切和蔼态度来弥补我们的不和。总之，这事已经到了严重的程度，竟损害了他的精神，害得他患了长久的，缠绵不去的痨病，虽然那病还不致要了他的性命。在这种苦恼的情况下，我不知道怎么办好。他的生命既是明显地日渐消沉，我或许在那里再嫁别人，才是个办法。我真该待在那里，但是我的心却烦躁不安热烈地盼望回到英国，未达到目的之前，没有一件事能够使我满意。

总之，由于我不断地哀求，我丈夫，很明显他已经衰颓下去了，最后终于被我说服了。我被自己的命运推动着，我当前的路已经没有障碍了，我母亲也在旁边协助，我终于得到一大批货物，作为我到英国后的生活费。

当我和兄弟（我现在该这样称呼他）离别的时候，我们说好在我到了英国之后，他将假说得到一个我死去的消息，所以他愿意的时候可以再结婚。他答应了，还说好将作为一个弟弟和我通信，而且帮助我，维持我的生活，直到我死了以后。假使他死在我之前，他将留下充分的钱给他母亲。当作一个姐妹来照顾我，在某些方面他对我的确关心，但是这事安排得太奇怪了，我后来竟感到很大的失望，你们在以后就会听到的。

我在八月里动身回到英国，我在那里已经住了八年。一件新的不幸跟着发生了，这或许有很少的女人经历过。

我们的航行还算顺利，走了三十二天才到了英国海岸，但是却受到两三次暴风的阻挠，有一次把我们赶到爱尔兰的海岸，我们驶到琴斯得尔去。我们在那里待了十三天，到岸上恢复一下精神，又扬帆开去，然而又遇到非常坏的天气，那只船弯下了中桅，他们是这么说的。但是我们终于到了威尔斯的弥尔福得港，虽然那离我们的码头很远，但是我的脚既已安稳地踏在我的家乡，不列颠岛的土地上。我决定不再到水上冒险，在我眼里那太可怕了。因此拿了我的衣服和钱财，带了我的起货单和其他文件上了岸，决定到伦敦去，让那只船尽力驶到它的码头，布里斯托，和我兄弟最有关系的店家也住在那里。

我差不多走了三星期才来到伦敦，在那里过了不久，听到那船已到了布里斯托，但是不幸得很，因为坏天气，船的中桅折断了，船受了大伤，大部分的货物都损失了。

我现在就要开始新的生活了，但这个新生活看来是可怕的。我带着一种永别的心情离开那地方。我带的货物的确是很可观的，如果平安地到达这里，靠着这些货物，我还可以好好地再嫁出去。但是经过这样一场灾难，我一共只剩了两三百金镑，而且也没有增加的希望了。我一个朋友也没有，不，甚至一个相识的人也没有。因为我觉得，不去重温旧交，那是绝对必要的。至于我那个精明的朋友，就是从前替我吹牛，说我拥有大量财产的那个，已经死了，她丈夫也过世了。

为了照顾我的货物，不久我又要到布里斯托去。当我办这事的时候，我常到巴斯去消遣，因为我还不老，所以我那贪欢的心情仍然是极盛的。现在我是个希图交好运的女人，虽然我并没有大量的财产，我总期望会碰到什么机会，增强我的财力，像我从前那样。

巴斯是个风流的地方，费用很高，充满了陷阱。我去那里，真的，目的是想看看有什么好机会，但是我对自己该说一句公道话，我没有存什么坏念头。我所打算的全是正当的手段，我起先简直没有想到会像我后来那样使自己堕落下去。

在这里我住了整个那里人所说的晚季，我结交了几个人。他们不但没有帮助我防止种种愚蠢的行为，后来反而引我堕入种种的愚行。我生活得很愉快，同体面的人们来往，也就是说同风流漂亮的人物来往。但是看到这种生活大量消耗我的银钱我又感到很恐慌。我既没有一定的进款，又这样花费我唯一的存钱，简直等于放血，同时我还感到很多忧虑。可是，我摆脱了这种愁怀，还是自己安慰自己，以为总有机会使我得到利益。

但是我去错了地方。我现在不是在勒德立夫，如果在那里我能够勉强铺排起来，也许有些诚实的船主或者什么人来同我正大光明地谈婚姻。然而我是在巴斯，人们有时在那里找姘头，却很少在那里找妻子。所以，一个女人在那里所能找到的也只有这样的朋友。

我开头一季在那里过得还算平静，因为虽然我同一个来巴斯消遣的绅士有了一些交情，可是我没有和他订下违法的条件。我拒绝了几个人偶然的调情，在这方面我处理得总算得法。我还没有坏到仅仅为着犯罪的快乐而去犯罪，也没有什么人利用我最需要的东西来引诱我。

然而，开头一季我达到这样的程度，就是结交了一个女人。我本来寄宿在她家里，虽然她并没有开着一所我们所谓的妓院，可是她自己也没有什么很好的节操。我每次举止总是这么正经，因此我的名誉并没有丝毫污点，同我来往的一切男人也都名誉很好，我同他们来往也没有什么受人非难之处。他们即使这样打算，也没有一个人似乎想到有这种不正当来往的可能。然而，有一位先生，像我上面所讲到的，总是单独和我在一起，陪我消遣，他还说，与我在一起他觉得很愉快，但是在那时候这里面并无其他的意思。

那群人全离开后，我在巴斯过了许多愁闷的时光。虽然我有时要到布里斯托去料理我的财产同款项，可是我高兴回到巴斯来久住，因为我不但与夏天寄宿那家的那个女人感情很融洽，而且还觉得冬天在那里居住比任何地方都便宜。在这里我快乐地过了秋天，却沉闷地过着冬天。但是我和寄宿那家的那个女人更亲近了一些，就免不了告诉她一些最沉重地压在我心上的事情，尤其是我财力拮据的情况。我还告诉她我有一个母亲一个兄弟住在弗吉尼亚，境况很不错。我既然已经写信给我母亲，报告我的状况和我所受的重大损失，我自然也该让我的新朋友知道，我盼望从那里得到一笔救济款，我的确是这样盼望着的。海船从布里斯托到弗吉尼亚的约克河，再从那里回来往往比从伦敦出发的海船时间花得少些。我兄弟又多半是同布里斯托的店家通信，因此我想在这里等候回信，比到伦敦去更合适些。

我这位新朋友似乎很为我的情况所感动。真的，她对我这么好，甚至在冬天把我住在这里的生活费降得很低，我相信她简直赚不到钱了。至于房子，我是一个钱也不出的。

春季来了，她仍然尽力照顾我，我同她住了一段时间，直到我看出有改换生活方式的必要。她有几个体面人，常来住在她家里，尤其是我所说的去年冬天单独找我陪他消遣的那位先生。他又来到这里，同来的有另外一位先生和两个仆人，住在他前回所住的那间屋子里。我疑心是我的女房东邀他来的，告诉他我仍然同她住在一起，但是她否认了这件事。

总而言之，这位先生来到这里，继续使我单独做他知心的朋友。他是个温文有礼的人，这是应该承认的。和他在一起我觉得很愉快，好像和我在一起（如果我可以相信他的话）他觉得很愉快是一样的。他对我并没有什么表示，只是非常的恭敬，对于我的道德他十分称赞。他常说，他相信假使他有其他的举动，我会鄙视地拒绝他。不久他知道我是个寡妇，我是搭前一班船从弗吉尼亚到布里斯托来的，我在巴斯等候下一艘从弗吉尼亚来的海船，盼望带来很多的财产。我听他说他有一个妻子，但是这位太太犯了神经错乱的毛病，由她自己的亲戚照顾着，因为怕人责备他没有好好为她医治，他同意这样办。当时他到巴斯来是为了在这样悲惨的环境中解除苦闷。

我的女房东主动地赞助这种来往，总是夸赞他的人品，说他是个知耻的君子，有道德的人，而且还有大量的财产。真的，我有许多理由这样相信他，因为虽然我俩住在同一层楼上，他常到我房间来，甚至当我躺在床上的时候。我也常到他房里去。然而除了接吻之外他对我从来没有任何进一步的举动，连求我答应他什么也未曾有过。直到好久以后他才向我提出了要求，这事你们以后会听到的。

我常和我的女房东谈到他的温文有礼，她对我说，她一开始就相信他是这样的。可是，她常对我说我应该从他那里得到一些好处，作为我陪伴他的报酬，因为他的确好像独占了我。我告诉她，我丝毫没有让他想到我需要他的帮助，或者我肯从他那里得到什么好处。她对我说她将自己承担这件事，而且办得巧妙。她同他谈过之后，我们第一次单独在一起的时候，他竟开始查问我的景况，问我自从上岸之后靠什么供养自己，问我是不是缺钱用。我很勇敢地推辞了。我告诉他虽然我的烟草货物受了损失，然而并没有完全丧失。受托替我料理一切的那位商人很诚实地为我办事，因此我不感到缺钱用。我希望能够节省一点，维持到新的一笔钱的到来，希望下一班海船会把那笔钱带来。在这期间我已经减少我的费用，前一季我雇了一个女仆，现在我已经不用了。那时我在二层楼有一间房子和一间食堂，这他知道，我现在只有三层楼上的一间房子。“但是，”我说，“我现在过得还是很满意。”我还说，和他在一起使我过得更快乐，因此我对他很感激。我所以说这些话是为了杜绝他向我提出任何要求的可能。然而，隔了不多时候，他又向我攻击，对我说，他觉得我不愿意把我的实情告诉他，这使他觉得很难过。他叫我相信，他查问这事，并不是想满足他自己的好奇心，却是为了要帮助我，假使有任何必要的话。既然我不肯自认有什么需要帮助的地方，他只希望我一件事，就是当我的确穷困时，或者将面临这个局面的时候，我肯坦白地告诉他。他既这么不客气地向我提出这个提议，我也应该同样不客气地告诉他。他还说，我要永远认为我有一个真朋友，虽然也许我不敢相信他。

我将一个心怀无限感激的人所该说的话全说了，告诉他我对于他的关怀十分了解。的确，从那时候起，我对于他不像先前那么拘束了，虽然双方还是处在严格道德的范围之内。但是无论我们的谈话多么随便，我却不能像他所希望的那样随便，就是说，告诉他我缺钱用。虽然对于他的提议我是暗自高兴的。

此后又过了几个星期，我还是没有向他要钱。我的女房东，那个狡猾的女人，老是敦促我去向他要，但是看我不能这样做，她就杜撰了一段故事，当我们在一块儿的时候，鲁莽地跑到我跟前说：“啊，寡妇！今天早上我有个坏消息要告诉你。”

“什么坏消息？”我说，“是弗吉尼亚来的商船被法国人抢去了吗？”因为这正是我所怕的事。

“不，不”她说，“是你昨天派去布里斯托取款的人回来了，说他一个钱也没有带回。”

她这样做，我很不高兴。我想这看起来太像暗示他了，他的确不愿受这种暗示，我明显地看出，我不去向他要，对我并没什么不利，因此我挡住了她。“我不知道他为什么说这话，”我说，“我派他去拿的钱全都拿来了，你看这就是，”说着我就拉出我的钱袋来，里面有十二个金币。我还说，“我打算不久就把大部分的钱给你。”

对于她开头所说的话，他好像有点不高兴，我也是这样，我想他会以为这人太无顾忌了。但是他听我这样回答，又立刻恢复了他本来的神情。第二天早上，我们又谈论这事，那时我看出他是完全满意了，他微笑着说，他希望我不要没钱而不告诉他，因为我已经答应他了。我告诉他，我的女房东前天那样公开地谈论与她无关的事情，我非常不高兴。但是我猜想，她要讨回我所欠她的钱，差不多有八个金币，我早已决定还给她，所以就在当天晚上给她了。

他听到我说已经把钱还她了，很高兴，接着我们就谈到别的事。第二天早上，他听到我已经起来了，就叫我，我回答了他。他请我到他房里去。我走进去的时候，他还躺在床上。他要我走近，坐在他的床边，因为他说他有些话要对我说。说了几句很殷勤的话之后，他问我肯不肯对他诚实，对他要求的一件事给他一个诚恳的答复。对于“诚实”这两个字我稍稍考虑了一下，然后我问他，我是否曾经给过他什么不诚恳的答复，接着我答应他我可以这样做。然后他就说出了他的要求，那就是，让他看看我的钱袋。我立刻就把手放到我的衣袋里，对他笑着，拉出了钱袋，里面有三个半金币。他问我这是不是我所有的钱。我告诉他不是，又笑着说，还多得很呢。

他说，那么，他希望我答应去把我所有的钱拿来，甚至每一个小铜币。我于是答应了，回到自己房里，把一个小小的私人箱子拿来，里面还有差不多六个金币，几块银币，一齐倒在他床上，告诉他这是我所有的财富，一个先令也不少。他看了一下，但是没有数，又把这些钱全部堆到箱子里，然后伸手到他的衣袋里，拿出一把钥匙，叫我打开他放在桌上的一个核桃木小匣子，把里面的一个盒子给他拿来。我照他的话办了。那盒子里有许多金币，我相信大约有二百个，但是我不知道到底有多少。他拿过那盒子，拉着我的手，让我把手放在盒子里，抓了一大把金币。我退缩不肯，但是他紧拉着我的手，把它放在盒子里，让我抓了一把所能抓起的金币。

然后，他让我把钱放进我的衣裙里，接着他又把我的小箱子拿来，把我所有的钱全倒在它的里面，叫我把这许多钱全带回我自己房里去。

我特别详细地叙述这段经过，是因为这里面所含的妙趣，表示出我们彼此的情谊。这事过了不久，他就开始天天挑剔我的衣服，说我的花边难看，说我的帽子不好，总之，劝我去买更好的。那是我十分愿意的，虽然我没有表示出来，因为世界上我所最喜欢的东西是漂亮的衣服。我对他说我必定要节省着用他借给我的钱，否则我就不能偿还他。他于是简单地告诉我，他既对我存着诚恳的敬意，又知道了我的境况，他不是把那些钱借我，而是送给我，他认为我应该得到这笔钱，因为我那么形影不离地陪伴他。此后，他要我雇个女仆，多租几间房子，那位与他同来巴斯的朋友回去了，他让我和他一起吃饭。我很高兴，照那情形看来，我相信我不会因此有什么损失的，那个女房东也没有忘记我们这样生活了差不多三个月。那群游客渐渐离开巴斯的时候，他也说要离开，而且希望我和他同到伦敦去。我对于这个提议并不十分放心，因为我不知道到了那里我会处于什么地位，或者他会怎样待我。但是正在我考虑这个问题的时候，他得了很厉害的病。他本来有事到索美塞得郡一个叫作瑟普吞的地方去，却在那里生了一场大病，使得他不能旅行，所以他派仆人回到巴斯，请我雇一辆马车，亲自到他那里去。在他走之前，他把所有的银钱和其他贵重东西，交托给我。怎样处理这些东西呢，我不知道，我只好尽力把这些东西收拾好，把房子锁好，到他那里去。到了那里，我看他病得很厉害，于是劝他躺在抬床上抬到巴斯来，在那里可以有更多的人和更好的医生照顾他。

他答应了，我于是把他带回巴斯，我记得那大概有十五里的路程。回来后，他继续患着寒热，病得很厉害，躺在床上有五个星期，这段时间全是我亲自看护他，陪伴他，就像妻子一样地尽心。真的，即使我是他妻子，也不能够更体贴了。我常常守他坐着，坐得那么久，直到最后他不愿让我再守夜了。于是，我就搬了一张小床到他房里，紧挨着他的床脚。

我深为他的病情担心，唯恐失去了这样的一个朋友。他现在怎样，将来也会怎样，我常常一连好几个钟头坐在他身旁哭泣。终于，他渐渐好些，使人们感到他会有痊愈的希望。的确，他后来渐渐复原了。

假使那实情不像我现在所要说的，我也不至于吞吞吐吐不肯说出来，这可以从在这本书里说到别的事情时我所取的态度看出来。但是我敢说，在我们一切的来往中，除了当我或者他躺在床上的时候走到彼此的房间里，还有他生病的时候，昼夜看护他这些必要的事情以外，我们中间未曾有过一点无廉耻的话或者举动。啊，如果一直这样又多么好呀！

过了些时候，他精力恢复，很快就好了。我要搬走我的小床，但是他要我等到他能够独自在房里，不用守夜看护的时候，再迁回自己的房里。

他利用许多机会来表示感激我的爱护。当他完全复原的时候，他给我五十金币作为酬劳。他说，我曾经拿了自己的生命去冒险，来救他的生命。

现在他深深地表示对我怀着一种真诚的、牢不可破的感情，但是始终表白他对于我们的道德是极端谨慎的。我告诉他关于这点我是十分满意的。他甚至向我声明，即使他是光着身子和我同床，他也要神圣地保存我的贞操，正如我受到一个强奸者的攻击时他将保护我的贞节一样。我相信他，而且告诉他我信得过他。但是这并不能使他满足，他说，他要等一个机会给我一个确实的证明。

此后过了许久，我为了自己的事要到布里斯托去，这回他替我雇了辆马车，要跟我同去。这时我们亲密的程度更加深了。从布里斯托他带我到格罗斯忒去，那是一趟快乐的旅行，呼吸些新鲜空气。在这里也真凑巧，旅馆里没有多余的房间，只剩下一个大房间，里面有两张床铺。旅馆主人领我们上去，走进那个房间，很坦白地对他说道：“先生，这位太太是不是你的夫人，我倒用不着问，即使不是的话，你们可以同样清白地躺在这两张床上，就像是在两间房子里一样。”说着，他拉过一片大布幔，分开了整个房间，的的确确地把两张床分开了。“好吧，”我朋友十分欣然地说，“这些床铺可以用，至于其他方面，我们的血统太近了，不能躺在一起，虽然我们可以彼此睡得很近。”这使这事现出正直不苟的样子。当我们快上床的时候，他规矩地走到房外，等到我已经躺在床上了，然后才躺到他自己的床上去睡，但是躺在那里和我谈了许久。

最后，他又重述他常说的话，他能够光着身子和我同睡，而不会给我丝毫的损害，一面从他床上跳下来。“现在，我亲爱的，”他说，“你将看到我对你是多么公道，以及我对你绝不食言。”说着就来到我的床上了。

我稍稍抵抗一下，但是坦白地说即使他没有说出这些保证的话，我也不会怎样抵抗的。所以挣扎了一下之后，我就静静地躺着，让他到我床上来。他到了我的床上，双手拥抱着我，这样我同他睡了整整一夜，但是，除了像我所说的，双手拥抱着我以外，他对于我没有任何其他的举动，也没有向我提出什么要求，不，也没有整晚如此。他早上就起来，穿好衣服，离开我时我还是和出世那天一样的纯洁。

对我说来，这是一件令人惊奇的事情，在明白自然规律怎样发生作用的人们的眼里，也是如此。因为他是一个强壮的，活泼有力的人。他这样做全不是出于一个宗教的信仰，却只是出于感情。他认为虽然在他心里我是世界上最可爱的女人，然而因为他爱我，他不能够伤害我。

我承认这是个高尚的原则，但是因为我从来不知道这个道理，所以我觉得这是十分可怕的。我们像以前一样地继续我们的旅行，最后又回到巴斯来了。在那里他既有机会随意到我这里，他常重演那种节制的功夫，我常同他睡在一起，虽然夫妇之间一切的亲热我们都有份儿，可是他从未要求进一步的行动，他为这点很看重自己。我并不是说我完全喜欢这种办法．像他所想的，因为我承认我更需要他。

我们这样过了将近两年，在这期间他只到伦敦去过三次，一次在那里待了四个月。但是说句公道话，他总是供给我钱，使我很舒服地过活。

假使我们继续这样下去，我自信我们很可以夸口。但是聪明的人们说过，故意走到悬崖去勒马是不妙的。我们就感到这样。现在我又要说句公道话，承认第一次破约不是因为他。有一天晚上，我们同在床上，温暖而快乐，那天晚上我们俩喝了比通常稍微多点的酒，但一点也没有使我们任何一个神经错乱。胡闹了一阵之后（那是我不能说出口的），我被他的双手紧紧地抱住，我对他说（我现在重述这话，还带着羞愧和灵魂的恐怖），我心里希望他有一夜免除约定，只这一夜。

他立刻照我的话办了，此后就无法阻挡他了。真的，我也不想再阻挡他了。

这样我们的道德控制算是打破了。我拿朋友的地位换来荡妇这个难听的、刺耳的头衔。早上我们两个都在忏悔，我很痛心地哭着，他也说自己很难过，这是我们当时所能做的一切。那条路既然这样开拓了，道德和良心的栏栅这样搬开了，我们此后就没有什么困难了。

那星期的其余几天，我们在一块儿的时候只有一个无味的话题。我红着脸望着他，时时发出那个悲惨的抗议，“假使我现在怀了孕，那可怎么办呢？那时，我将怎么办呢？”他壮我的胆，对我说，只要我忠心于他，他总会忠心于我。既然弄到这个地步（他真是从没有存这个心），假使我怀了孕，他将照顾孩子和我。这使我们两人更死心地继续下去。我请他相信假使我怀孕了，我宁可因为没有接生婆而死去，也不肯说出他是那孩子的父亲。他请我相信假使我怀了孕，绝不至于没有人来接生。这种互相的保证使我们死心塌地去做，此后我们随意常常再犯那种犯罪行为。等到最后，我起先担心的事真的成为事实，我果然怀孕了。

我相信自己怀孕了，也使他相信了之后，我们就开始设法来处理这事。我提议把这秘密告诉我的女房东，并且征求她的意见，这个办法他很赞成。我的女房东，一个常干这种事的女人（我看出了），倒觉得这事无所谓。她说她知道最后会弄成这样子的！她还为这事和我们大开玩笑。像我前面所说的，我们觉得她是一个对这类事有经验的老婆婆，由她安排一切的事情。她答应去找一个接生婆和一个看护妇，把别人的一切查问回答得非常圆满，顾全了我们的体面，她真是把这些事干得巧妙异常。

当我快分娩的时候，她请我的男人到伦敦去，或者假装到伦敦去。当他走后，她通知教区里的执事人员说，有一位太太将在她家里生产，她与这位太太的丈夫很熟悉，而且告诉他们一个捏造的名字，她把他叫作华尔特·克利夫爵士。她告诉他们他是一个很值得敬重的绅士，有什么需要查问的事她都能够回答。这立刻使教区里的执事人感到满意，我受人敬重地分娩了，即使我真是克利夫夫人，也不过如此。我临产时受了巴斯三四位最有声望的太太的帮助，然而，这使他为我花了更多的钱。我常对他说我为这事很过意不去，但是他劝我不必担心。

他既然很充足地供给我钱，做我分娩时这笔极大的开销，所以我生产时的一切都极阔绰，但是我不喜欢弄得太华丽，也不爱过分铺张。并且根据我的经验，我很知道世界上的事情。明知这类事情常常不能维持很久，因此留心尽量积攒些钱，为的是晴时预备雨时粮，一面让他相信这些钱全花在我分娩时阔绰的铺张上面。

用这种手段，加上前面所说他过去给我的钱，我在分娩完结时身边差不多有二百金币，里面有一部分还是我自己的钱剩下来的。

我生下一个好孩子，一个可爱的孩子。当他听到这消息的时候，写了一封很恳挚殷勤的信给我，然后又写信告诉我，等我能起床，身体一恢复，就到伦敦来，他认为那对我会更体面些。他在罕麦斯密已经为我预备了房子，那么就好像我是从伦敦到那里去的。再过一些时候我可以回到巴斯去，他也和我一同去。

我很喜欢这个提议，所以特意雇了一辆马车，带了我的孩子，一个看护喂他奶的乳母和一个女仆跟我一起到伦敦去。

他坐自己的四轮马车到勒定来接我，携我走进他的车里。剩下仆人同小孩在雇的马车里，这样他带我到罕麦斯密我的新居。我太应该喜欢这所新居了，因为那是所非常漂亮的房子。

我现在真是到了我的幸运的最高峰，我什么也不缺，所缺的只是没有当一个正式的妻子，然而在这种情形之下是办不到的。所以我无时不在想法尽力去节省，像我上面所说的，好为将来缺钱的时候做个准备，因为我明知道这种事情是不会永远继续下去的。有姘头的男人们常常更换他们的姘头，厌倦她们了，或者吃起醋来，或者类似的事。有时别人爱戴的女人却不做贤惠的事情来保持人们对她们的敬重，或者好好地保存她们的贞节，一日她们被人们蔑视地丢掉，那真是罪有应得。

但是在这点上我是没有危险的，因为我既不想去换一个人，所以也不想去认识什么人，那么也就没有见异思迁的引诱。除了我寄宿的那个人家，还有隔壁一位牧师太太以外，我不同任何人来往。所以当他不在家的时候，我不去找谁，每当他回来的时候，也从未曾看到我不在自己房里或者客厅里。假使我到什么地方去换换空气，也总是和他一同去的。

我这样和他过活，他这样和我过活，的确是世界上最偶然的事情。他常向我声明，他刚刚和我结识的时候，甚至于到我们第一次破坏了我们约章的那天晚上，他绝没有丝毫想和我交合的打算。他一向对我存着真挚的感情，绝没有想过要干他所干的事情。我请他相信我绝没有猜疑他。假使我疑心，我也不会这么轻易答应他那种引起后来的事情的放肆行为，那是一件出乎意料的事情，那是因为那天晚上我们太顺着彼此的意思做了。真的，此后我常常说，关于满足我们淫乱不自持的放肆的欲望这一点，我们应当谨慎，怕的是正当道德的决心最不可缺少的时候，意志却离开了我们。这可以给这个故事的读者做个警告。

说真的，自从我开始同他来往的第一刻起，我就决定让他同我交合，如果他提出这事。这是因为我要得到他的帮助，我不知道除此以外还有什么别的法子，能够笼络住他。但是那天晚上当我们同在一起的时候，而且，像我上面所说的，已经达到那个地步的时候，我发现了我的弱点。那种欲望是抵抗不住的，甚至在他向我提出请求之前，我已经不得不放弃一切了。

然而，他待我那么公道，他绝没有拿那件事来责备我。他也从没有在任何时候对于我的行为表示丝毫的不满，而且总是声明他和我们第一次在一起时一样地喜欢我。

那是真的，他没有妻子，那就是说，她对于他已经不是妻子了，但是良心的反省常常把一个男人，尤其是一个明理的男人，从一个姘妇的怀中夺去。它最后也把他从我怀中夺去了，虽然并不在这个时候。

另一方面，对我所过的生活，我自己也受到良心的暗中责备。就是当我的满足达到空前未有的程度的时候，我眼中还是看到一个穷困饥饿的可怕前途，像个可怕的魔鬼似的站在我的面前，所以我不敢回头看。但是穷困既带我走上这条路，所以对于穷困的恐惧使我不得不留在那里，假使我能够积下足够维持生活的一笔钱，我自愿整个儿地离开这条路。但这都是些无关紧要的念头，他一来到我的面前，这些念头就消失了。因为和他在一起是这么快乐，所以他一来到，一切愁闷，就会随之消失。那些想法全是我孤单地留在家里的时候才有的。

在这种既快乐而又不快乐的环境里我过了六年，这一时期我为他生了三个孩子，但是只有第一个活着。虽然在这六年里我搬了两次家，可是第六年我又回到罕麦斯密里我开头住的那所房子。就在那里，一天早上，我吃惊地接到我男人寄来的一封恳挚而悲哀的信，告诉我他觉得很不舒服，恐怕又要病一场，但是他妻子的亲戚和他在一块儿，所以我不能和他在一起，然而他表示对这种环境很不满意，假使人家肯让我像从前那样地照顾和看护他，那就好得多了。

我听到这个消息很担心，急着要知道他的病情。我等了两个星期左右，什么音信也没有得到，这使我感到很惊奇，于是开始不安起来。我想，可以说，在第三四个星期内，我差不多是疯了。我感到特别着急的是不知道他住在哪里。因为我起先假定他是住在他岳母家里的，但是我回到伦敦以后，根据他告诉我的通信地址，很快就知道了怎样去打听。我打听到他住在布沦斯柏立街上一所房子里，他把全家都搬到那里。他的妻子和他的岳母也同住在那里，尽管人们不让他妻子知道她是和丈夫同住在一起的。

我不久又听说他病得快要死了，这几乎把我急死，极想得到一个真实的消息。一天晚上，我巧妙地把自己装扮成个女仆，戴上圆软帽和草帽，走到门前，说是他从前住的地方的邻居太太派来代主人和主妇问候的，同时探问先生的病况，以及前晚睡得如何。传达这些话的时候，我得到我所欲得的机会。因为我和一个女仆谈起天来，我和她说了一大阵闲话，知道他病的一切详细情形，我知道他得的是一种肋膜炎，带有咳嗽和发烧。她还告诉我谁住在他家里，他的妻子怎样，照她说，他们还希望她可以恢复理智。至于那位先生呢，医生说，他没有多大希望了，那天早上他们以为他就要死了，这时他也只是好一点，但是他们还认为他活不过明天晚上。

这对我是一个极其可怕的消息，我现在开始看到我幸运的终止，想到我曾经勤俭持家，在他活着的时候，积下了一些钱，是很好的，因为现在我看不到自己面前有一条谋生的路了。

此外，我还有一件发愁的事，那就是我有一个儿子，一个美丽可爱的孩子，差不多有五岁了。可我却没有为他预备一笔钱，最少我是没想到。怀着这些思虑和一颗悲哀的心，那天晚上我回到家里，开始打算自己将怎样过活，怎样安排，去度过余生。

你们可以相信我是不能放心的，必定很快又去打听他的情形。我不敢自己再去，就派几个假装的探信人去。等到又过了两个星期，我听说他的生命有希望了，虽然他还是病得很厉害。然后，我就不再派人到那里去了，再过些时日，我听他的邻居说他已经在屋里走动了，然后又听说他能到外面来了。

我那时一点也不怀疑我会很快听到他的信息，于是开始安慰自己，以为我的境况要复原了。我等了一个星期，两个星期，很惊奇地等了差不多两个月，一点信息也没有听到，只知道他复原后，为了换换空气使他的病体可以恢复得更快一些，就到乡间去了。此后又过了两个月，我听说他又来到他城里的家中，但是我仍然没有听到他的一点消息。

我写了好几封信给他，信封上的住址也和平常一样，后来发现只有两三封他来取了，其余的却没有取去。我用一种从来未曾用过的迫切口气，又写信给他，在一封信里我告诉他我的境况，我欠了房租，孩子没有生活费，我自己如何可怜，在他严肃地答应照料我并供给我的费用之后，我怎样的衣食无着。我把这封信另外誊写了一份，看到这封信放在那里快一个月了，还没有人去取。我就想出一个法子把另外誊写的这一份交到我听说他常去的一个咖啡馆里，让他亲自去取。

这封信逼得他给了我一个回复，从回信里，虽然我看出我是被遗弃了，可是我也看出他前不久曾经写过一封信给我，要我再到巴斯去。信的内容我不久就会说到。

说真的，当人们躺在病床上的时候，对我们这种来往是用和我们以前不同的一副面孔和眼光看待的。我的爱人曾经走近死亡之门和永劫的边际，他对于过去风流放荡的生活感到莫大的懊悔和悲伤。尤其是和我的这种违法的来往恰恰是一种持续很久的奸淫生活。它已经现出真相，不像他从前所想象的那样了，而是对这事感到极大的厌恶。

我免不了又要说，而且把这话当作我们女性干这类寻乐事情时的一个指南：每当诚恳的忏悔随着这类的罪恶而来的时候，对于对方必定产生一种憎恨。起先的感情越是浓厚，那憎恨也就越深。总会这样的。的确也不能够有别的结果，因为既然对那罪恶怀着真正的恶感，当然对罪恶的根源也不能见爱。既然对于罪恶怀着仇恨，自然对于一同犯罪的人也要怀恨。你不能期望有别的结果。

我这时的情形就是这样，虽然这位先生礼貌很好，心地公道，没有走什么极端，但是从这件事情的简短经过看来，他的为人也不过如此。他从我最后一封信和其他一些信里看出，我没有到巴斯去，而他的第一封信我也没有收到，他就写给我下面这封信：

太太，我很奇怪我前月八日所发的信竟没有到你手里。我向你发誓那是送到你的寓所，交到你的女仆手里的。

我用不着告诉你我过去一些时候的情形以及我走到了坟墓的边缘，又如何借上天意外的、我不配接受的慈悲而复活了。在我生病的时候，我们不幸的来往在我的良心上不能算是最轻的重累，这你是会知道的。我用不着再说什么，需要忏悔的事情也一定要改正的。

我希望你能够回到巴斯去。我这里附上一张五十金镑的支票，做你还清房租和回去的费用。我还要告诉你，只是为了这个缘故，并非因为你哪方面触犯了我，我不能再和你见面了，我希望你不要感到吃惊。我对于孩子将有相当的照顾。把他留在那里，或者带他和你同走，都随你的便。我希望你也有同样的感想，这对你会有利的。——我是你的，等等。

我看到这封信好像受了一千处的创伤，我自己良心的责备是无法形容的，因为我也明白自己的罪恶。我想，假使继续和我兄弟在一块儿，我的过失或许会少些，因为我们两个当时都不知道，就是结了婚也不会有罪。

但是我从来没有想到我这些时候是个已经嫁了人的女人，布商某某先生的妻子，虽然他被环境所逼，离开我了，却没有权力让我免受我们两人婚约的束缚，或者给我一种法律上的自由，再去嫁人。所以这些时候我的的确确是一个荡妇和淫妇。我又责备自己的放纵行为，我怎样诱骗了这位先生，真正做了这个罪恶的主犯以及现在他被真挚的感触慈悲地从深坑中救出，但是我却剩下来，好像被神的慈悲所遗弃了，为上天所不睬了，去继续我的邪恶行为。

在这种感想之下，我继续过着很愁闷、很悲哀的生活，差不多有一个月时光，也没回到巴斯去，因为我不想再和从前那个女人在一起，害怕她会教唆我再走进什么罪恶的生活，像她从前所干的那样。而且，我也不愿意让她知道我是被人遗弃了。

现在我对于我的孩子倒很觉为难。要我和这孩子分开，那简直等于叫我死，然而想到将来有一天我和他在一起，看护着他，却没有一笔钱来抚养他的这种危险时，就决定把他留在现在所住的地方。但是我那时又打好主意我自己还住在他邻近，那么我可以有看到他的快意，却没有供养他的麻烦。因此我写了一封短信给我的男人，告诉他我什么事都听他的命令，除了回到巴斯去这件事。与他分开虽然对我是一个永远不能复原的创伤，可是我十分相信他的想法是对的，而绝不想去阻碍他改过的决心。

然后我用我所能写的最动情的话，向他说出我自己的境况。我告诉他，我希望能感动他，使他对我发生慷慨的友谊的那些不幸的苦难，现在也会感动他对我表示一点关切，虽然我们来往中的犯罪行为（我相信我们两个那时都没有存心想坠到里面去，）结束了。我也想像他一样诚恳地忏悔一番，但是我求他保证我一定的生活，那么我可以不至于看到可怕的穷困前途而受到引诱。假使他怕我麻烦，那么我求他让我回到弗吉尼亚我母亲的家里去，他知道我是从那里来的，这样他就不会再有什么恐惧了。最后我告诉他，假使他再寄给我五十金镑，使我更容易动身，我必定回他一张断绝关系的保证书，答应绝不再麻烦他了，除非是要了解孩子的健康情况。假使我到了那里，我的母亲还活着，我的境况也很不错，我必定写信叫孩子到我那里去，让他不必操心了。

这完全是一种欺骗。其实我并没打算到弗吉尼亚去，我在那里过去的事迹，一说出来就使谁都相信我不会去的。但是我的目的是，假使可能的话，从他那里得到这最后的五十金镑，因为我明知道这是我所能得到的最后的一些钱了。

然而，我所提出的理由，就是说，给他一张断绝关系的保证书，绝不再去麻烦他，很有效地说服了他。他派一个人送给我一张支票，那个人还带了一张断绝关系的保证书让我签字，我坦然地签了字，收了那笔钱。这样，虽然很痛心地违背了我的意思，这件事终算告一段落。

在这里我不免想到，处在像我们从前那样地位的人们，借口居心纯良，友谊深厚等等，彼此太放纵产生了不幸结果。因为肉欲常常在这种友谊中起了很大的作用，以致最后会压倒最严肃的决心。当廉耻丧失的时候，罪恶就会冲进来，真正纯洁的友谊却应该极严格地保存这种廉耻。但是我把这些事留给读者，让他们自己去发出正当的判断吧，他们比我更能够讲得有说服力，我是这么快又糊涂起来了，所以也不是一个很高明的劝告者。

我现在又是一个独身的人了，我可以这样叫我自己。世界上一切做妻子或者做姘妇的义务我都摆脱了，虽然我还有那位当布商的丈夫，可是我现在差不多有十五年没有得到他的信息。我自以为和他毫无关系谁也不能怪我，何况他临走时告诉我过，如果我不能常常得到他的信息，我可以认为他死了，我爱再嫁谁，就可以嫁谁。

我现在开始计算我的存款了。我写了许多信，经过多次的请求，以及我母亲从中斡旋之后，我从我住在弗吉尼亚的兄弟（我现在这样称呼他）那里得到了第二批货物，用来补偿我带走的货物的损失，不过却附加了一个条件，那就是我要订立一个断绝关系的保证书给他。我虽然觉得有些不高兴，但是却不得不答应他。然而，这件事我处理得很巧妙，在我未曾在保证书上签字以前，就把货物取走，以后我老是找各种借口，躲避这件事，企图拖延下去。最后我又借口我必定要写信给我兄弟，得到他的回信，然后我才肯签字。

这笔赔偿的钱也算在内，在我得到那最后的五十金镑之前，我看我的财力，一共算起来，差不多有四百金镑，再加上我所有的，差不多有四百五十金镑。我还另有一百多金镑，但是因为这笔钱我却碰到一回倒霉的事，那就是，我委托这笔钱的一个金匠破产了，所以我损失了七十金镑，这个人的债务和解费是每一百金镑只交三十金镑。我有一点金银器皿，但是不多，衣服和衣料却积得很多，是足够用的。

拿了这些资本，我又重入世途了。但是你们应当想一想我现在的模样和我住在勒德立夫的时候不同了。第一，我差不多老了二十岁，我的年纪和我到弗吉尼亚去的旅行都不会使我增了颜色。虽然凡是可以使我打扮得更好看的东西我一件也没有忽略过——除了涂脂抹粉，因为我还不甘愿做这种事——然而二十五岁和四十二岁看起来总有些不同的。

我对于将来的生活，筹划了无数的道路，开始很严肃地考虑应当怎么办，但是一直没有什么机会到来。我开始设法使人们把我看作拥有厚资的人，使人们传说我有许多财产，而我的财产是在我自己手里，下面这点倒是真的，上面这点却像我前面所说的。我没有朋友，这是我最大的不幸，结果就是没有一个顾问，尤其是，没有一个人能够推心置腹地将我的真实情况偷偷地谈谈。我从经验上看出，除了贫穷以外没有朋友是一个女人最坏的处境了。我说一个女人，是因为很明显，男人能够做他们自己的顾问，能够指挥他们自己，比女人更懂得怎样使自己从困难中打出一条路来，去做自己的事情。但是假使一个女人没有朋友可以谈谈自己的事情，得到教诲，得到帮助，那么十有八九她是完了。不，她越是有钱，她被欺受骗的危险越大。我把一百金镑放在那位金匠的手里，就是这样的情形，如我上面所说的，他的信用好像已经渐渐下落了，但是没有谁可以商量，一点也不知道这回事，所以损失了我的金钱。

当一个女人剩下孤单单的一个人，一点劝告都得不到的时候，她正像一袋钱或者一块宝石，掉在大路上，自然会落在第一个路人的手中。假使一个有道德、主持正义的人刚好碰到这东西，他会拿这东西去招领，原主也许又会听到这东西的消息。但是这样一个东西落在那些毫不犹豫地夺为己有的人们手中多少次，才能有一次碰到好人呢？

这分明是我的情形，因为我现在是个无拘无束、无人指导的人，没有帮手，没有扶助，没有人来指导我的行为。我知道我的目的，也知道我所要的是什么，但是却不知用什么手段去达到那个目的。我很想能过安定的生活，假使我碰到一个谨慎的好丈夫，我一定做个非常贤良的妻子。不然的话，罪恶总是从穷困之门而来，绝不会从欲望之门而来的。正因为我没有得到安定的生活，所以才深深了解这种生活的价值，绝不至于做什么事，失掉这种生活的幸福。不，我所经历过的一切艰苦使我更要做一个好妻子。我那几回当妻子的时候，我的行为也从未使我的丈夫们感到任何不安。

但是这一切都是无用的。我没有遇到增强我勇气的事情。我等候着，我规规矩矩地过活，极力节省，量入为出，但是什么机会也没有，什么办法也没有，我的钱却很快地消耗着。我不知道怎么办，对于未来的穷困的恐惧使我的心绪愁闷不堪。我有一些钱，但是我不知道把它安顿在哪里，那些钱的利息也不够维持我的生活，至少在伦敦过活是不成的。

后来，一个新的局面展现在我面前。我所寄宿的那个地方有个北方的女人，她谈话中最常提到的是她那边伙食怎样低廉，生活怎样舒适。那里的东西多么丰足，多么便宜，他们来往的人们是多么上等以及其他这类的话。后来，我对她说，她打动了我的心，我想到她那边去住。因为我是一个寡妇，虽然我有足够的钱可以维持生活，可是无法使我的财力增加。而且伦敦是个奢侈的地方，在这里住，一年不超过一百金镑是不行的。除非我不跟人交往，不用仆人，不讲外观，自己埋在家里，好像我有什么不得已的理由必须这样做。

我应当说明，我一直使她像其他人一样相信我很有钱，或者最少也有三四千金镑，甚至更多些，这笔钱又全在我自己手里。当她以为我有意到她那边去的时候，对我非常亲密。她说她有个姊妹住在利物浦附近，她的兄弟是那里一位有声望的绅士。在爱尔兰还有一片大地产。她说大约过两个月她要到那里去，假使我肯陪她一块儿去，我将像她一样受到欢迎，住一个月或者再久一些，可以随我的便，那就看我爱不爱那个地方。假使我以为住在那里很合适，她敢担保他们会替我料理一切，即使他们自己不能接待寄寓的人们，也会介绍我到一些合适的家庭里，在那里我会住得十分满意。

如果这个女人知道我的真实情况，她绝不会安排这么多圈套，辛辛苦苦想这么多办法，来捕捉这样一个可怜的、孤苦伶仃的人。这样的人即使被捉住，也值不得什么。真的，我的情形几乎是绝望了，我想我的境况再坏不过了，因此只要他们对我没有什么伤害，至于会碰到什么，也就用不着考虑了。经过许多次的邀请和她的诚实友谊和真正要好的表示以后，我终于被她说服了和她同去，因此我捆好我的行李预备去旅行，虽然我绝对不知道到什么地方去。

现在我觉得自己有个大难题。我在世界上所有的一点财产全是现款，除了像前面所说的，一些金银器皿，一些衣料和我的衣服。至于家中的用具，我只有一点，或者说等于零，因为我一向住在公寓里。但是我在世界上竟没有一个朋友，可以把我所有的这点东西托给他，或者告诉我怎样去处置这些东西，这事使我日夜不安。我想起银行和伦敦其他的公司，但是我没有一个朋友，可以托他代替这银行的票据、账簿、支票和其他这类的东西，而只能带在身边，自己保存着。可是，又怕不安全。假使这些文件丢了，我的钱也丢了，那么我就完了。而另一方面，因为这些东西，我也许会遭到抢劫或者在异乡被人谋杀了，因此我不知道怎么办好。

一天早上我忽然想起我自己要到银行去。这家银行我是常去取利息的，在那里我曾碰到一位职员，我和他接洽，他对我非常诚实公平，有一回他对我特别公道，当我数错了钱，没有拿够我应得的数目，正要走的时候，他竟把我叫住了，给我其余的钱，那笔钱他尽可以放进他自己的口袋里的。

这一次我去找他，告诉他我是一个没有朋友的可怜寡妇，不知道怎么办好，问他肯不肯受点麻烦做我的顾问。他对我说，假使在他的职业范围以内有什么事情我想得到他的意见，他将努力使我不至于吃亏，但是他还要介绍我认识一位谨慎的好人，他也是干这类职务的一个职员，虽然不在这家银行里，他的见识很不错，他的诚实我也可以信赖。“因为，”他还说，“我可以担保，担保他所做的一切没有问题。假使他骗了你一个最小的铜币，太太，这可以归咎于我，我也一定要赔偿。他喜欢帮助人办这种事，他把干这种事，当作一种慈善的举动。”

我听到这话有一点犹豫，停了一会儿，我告诉他我宁可信赖他，因为我看出了他是诚实的人，但是假使办不到，我一定接受他的推荐。“我敢说，太太，”他说，“你对于我的朋友，会像对于我一样地感到十分满意，他一定能够彻底地帮助你，这是我所做不到的。”他大概满手都是银行里的事，除了行里的事情他什么事也不干预。因此他又说，因为给我出主意或帮忙，他的朋友不会向我要钱，这话对我真是一个很大的鼓励。

他定好当天晚上，银行关门之后我去会他和他的朋友。我一看见他的朋友，刚一开始谈这件事，我就觉得很满意，认为碰到了一个很诚实的人。他的脸孔就显出他的诚实，我后来听说，他的声名到处都好，我对于他简直不再有任何怀疑。

第一次会面时，我只说了我前面所说的话，我们分手时，他同我定好第二天到他那里去，他还说我同时还可以向人查问他的品格，但是我却不知道怎样去办，我自己是一个朋友也没有的。

第二天我就去见他，那一次我更随便地对他说了我的情形。我把我的情况大致告诉了他。我说我是一个从美洲来的寡妇，十分孤独无依，一个朋友也没有。我有一点钱，只有一点，因为怕失掉这些钱，都快疯了，因为在世界上没有一个朋友可委托去料理这笔钱。我打算到英国北部去，因为那里的生活便宜一些，这样我的存款就不至于浪费了。我很愿意将我的钱放在银行里，但是我不敢把票据带在身边。至于怎样同银行通信，或者同谁通信，我也不知道。

他对我说我可以把钱存在银行里，当作一笔账目，这项款既然记在账簿上，我就有资格随时去取，假使我住在北方，我可以向出纳员发出支票，随我高兴，写信去领款。但是，这却只算作活期存款，银行对于这项存款不付利息。我还可以用我的钱去买股票，这股票可以储蓄在那里，但是假使什么时候我想把它卖掉，我必定要特意到城里来，把它让出，甚至于我领每半年一次的股息也有些困难，除非是我亲身在这里，或者有个可以信得过的朋友，用他的名义来买股票，找他替我办理一切，不过这也有我前面所说的同样困难。说着这话，他瞪着眼睛望着我，微微地笑了一下。最后，他说，“你为什么不找个总管家，太太？他可以照顾你和你的钱，那么省得你麻烦了。”

“是的，先生，那么钱也就不在我手里了，”我说，“因为我真觉得两方面的危险都是一样的。”但是我记得我偷偷地对自己说：“我希望你把问题提得明明白白，我一定要慎重地考虑一下，然后才说‘不’字的。”

他和我谈了许多次，有一两次我想他是存有深意的，但是我真伤心，我最后听到他有一个妻子。但是当他自认他有一个妻子的时候，他摇了摇头，有些忧虑地说道，他的确有一个妻子，但是又没有妻子。我开始想他是处在我前个爱人的地位，他的妻子是神经错乱了或者疯了。可是，我们那次没有再多谈，他告诉我他那时事务很忙，可是假使我肯在他事务完结之后到他家里去，他可以考虑怎样替我安排，把我的事情处理得十分稳妥。我告诉他我一定来，希望他告诉我他住在哪里。他写下了他的住址，当他交给我的时候，他把它念了一遍，说道：“这就是，太太，假使你敢冒险相信我的话。”“是的，先生，”我说，“我相信我可以冒险相信你，因为你自己说过了，你有一个妻子，而我又不需要找丈夫。何况，我敢把我的钱委托给你，那是我在世界上所有的一切，假使失去了，我敢冒险到任何地方去。”

他说了几句开玩笑的话，那是很漂亮、很有礼貌的，假使那些话是真的，那会使我非常高兴。但是那些话只是说说而已，我拿了那住址，约好当晚七点钟到他家里找他。

我到了以后，他提议几种办法，把我的钱存在银行里，为的是我可以得到利息，但是这样办仍然有种种的困难，他都反对，以为是不安全的。我看出他是一个真诚无私的人，便心想，我的确找到了我所需要的诚实人，绝找不到更好的了。所以我很坦白地告诉他我还未曾遇到过一个我可以相信的男人和女人，或者我可以放心委托的人。我看他这样无私地关心我的安全，就毫无顾虑地把我所有的一点点钱托他料理，假使他肯答应做一个不能给他薪金的可怜寡妇的管家。

他微笑着站起来，很恭敬地向我致敬。他对我说，我对他这样信任使他不能不觉得非常感激。因此他不肯骗我，愿意尽他的力量来为我效劳，却不期望得到什么酬报。但是假如那种委托使他被疑为是出于自私的话，他绝不肯接受。假使我死了，他同执行遗嘱的人还要争论的话，他很不喜欢找这种麻烦。

我告诉他如果他担心的只是这两点，我将很快打消他的顾虑，使他相信没有一点困难。因为，第一，谈到怀疑，如果我会怀疑他，应该是现在这个时候，那么我绝不会把钱交在他手里。而我什么时候怀疑他，他就可以把这事辞退，拒绝再干下去。其次，至于执行遗嘱人，我请他相信我是没有继承人的，在英国也没有什么亲戚，我不要继承人，也不要执行遗嘱人，我只委托他，除非我在死之前再嫁，那么他的受托同麻烦也同时终止了，然而我还看不出有这种可能。但是我告诉他假使我在现在这样的情况下死去，这笔钱就完全归他所有，他既然对我这么忠实，也配得到这笔钱。

他听到这话，脸上变了颜色，问我为什么对他这样好，而且显出很高兴的样子说，为了我的缘故，他可以很正当地希望他是个单身汉。我微笑着对他说，他既不是个单身汉，我的提议就不会含有勾引他的意思，他那样想不应该，因为那样对不起他妻子。

他说我说得不对。“因为，”他说，“我从前不是和你说过吗，我有妻子，可是又没有妻子，即使希望把她绞死，也不能算我的罪过。”

“你那方面的情况，我一点也不知道，先生，”我说，“但是希望你妻子死去，那总不能算无罪。”

“我告诉你，”他又说，“她是我的妻子，也不是我的妻子。你不了解我是什么人，也不了解她是什么人。”

“那是真的，”我说，“先生，我不了解你是什么样的人，但是我相信你是个诚实人，这是我所以这么相信你的唯一原因。”

“不错，”他说，“我是这样的一个人，但是我还有别的头衔，太太，因为，坦白地对你说吧，我是一个乌龟，她是一个婊子。”他用一种说笑的口吻说着，但是脸上带着那么不自然的微笑，我看出这事沉重地打击着他的内心，他说这话的时候，现出惨然的表情。

“那么，先生，你刚说的那一点，”我说，“情形就不同了。但是一个乌龟，你知道，可以是个诚实的人，所以这也不能使事情有什么不同。而且，我想，”我说，“你的妻子对你既然这么不忠实，你对她可是太忠实了，还认她做你的妻子。不过这是和我不相干的。”

“不，”他说，“我并不想把她抛开。坦白地对你说吧，太太，我也不是一个甘心情愿的乌龟。相反，我告诉你吧，这使我愤怒到极点，但是我也无可奈何。要当婊子的女人总是要当婊子的。”

我撇开了这个话题，开始讲我的事情。但是我看出他不能收起那个话题，就让他谈下去。他继续把这事情的一切经过全告诉了我，故事太长，不能在这里重述。特别是，在他干现在的差事之前，有一段时间，他不在英国，她就跟军队里的一位军官生了两个孩子，等他回到英国的时候，她表示悔改，于是他又收留了她，很好地供给她的生活。可是她又跟一个布商的学徒偷跑了，把她所能拿到的钱全拿了去，还是没有和他一起过活。“所以，太太，”他说，“她是个淫妇，不是出于生活的需要，那通常是你们女性堕落的原因，而是由于欲望，单单为了罪恶本身的缘故。”

我可怜他，希望他能够完全摆脱了她，可是我还是要谈我的事情，然而这是办不到的。最后他眼睛盯着我。“你看，太太，”他说，“你来征求我的意见，我一定忠实地为你效劳，好像你是我的亲姊妹。但是我必定要翻转过来了，这是因为你使我这么做，你对我这么亲切，我想我必须征求你的意见了。告诉我，一个被人欺侮的可怜人对于一个淫妇应该怎样办才好？我应该怎样来替自己报复呢？”

“唉！先生，”我说，“这是一件太难解决的事情，我不能提供意见，但是她似乎已经离开了你，所以你已经完全摆脱了她。你还能再想什么呢？”

“是的，她真是去了，”他说，“但是我还没有和她脱离关系。”

“这是真的，”我说，“她真可以使你负责，但是法律也提供了你许多法子去预防这一点。你可以声明她不合法，像一般人所说的。”

“不，不，”他说，“倒不是这个问题。这一点我已经注意到了。我所说的不是这件事，我是要除掉她，那么我可以再娶。”

“那么，先生，”我说，“你必须同她离婚。假使你能照你所说的话去做，你一定能够达到离婚的目的，那么你就自由了。”

“那是很难办，很费钱的。”他说。

“哎呀，”我说，“假使你能够使你所喜欢的任何女人相信你的话，我想你的妻子不会同你争闹，因为你享受了她自己所享受的自由。”

“是的，”他说，“但是叫一个诚实的女人来干这事，那是不容易的。至于别种女人，”他说，“我有了她已经麻烦够了，不敢再去惹别个淫妇。”

我立刻心想：“假使你问我肯不肯，我一定全心全意地答应你。”但这只是对我自己说的。对他我却回答道：“唉，你关起门，不让一个诚实的女人来爱你，因为你把一切肯冒险来陪你的女人都看作是坏的，断定现在肯跟你的女人必定不是诚实的。”

“哎呀，”他说，“我是希望你说一个诚实的女人肯跟我，我是肯冒一下险的。”接着忽然问我道，“你肯跟我吗，太太？”

“在你说过那些话之后，你倒不该问这问题，”我说，“可是，恐怕你会以为我等着你收回那些话，我现在却要明白地回答你，‘不，’我不肯。我和你商量的是另一个问题，我并没有希望你把我在惶惑不宁的情况下，向你提出的庄严请求化作一场喜剧。”

“哎呀，太太，”他说，“我和你感到同样的惶惑不宁，也和你一样地需要别人的忠告，因为我想假使我得不到安慰，我就会疯了，我告诉你吧，我不知道走哪条路好。”

“哎呀，先生，”我说，“关于你的问题，倒比我的问题容易想办法。”

“那么，请你说说吧，”他说，“因为现在你增加了我的勇气。”

“哎呀，”我说，“假使你的情形像你所说的那样简单，你可以按照法律离婚，那么你可以找到很多的诚实女人，光明正大地去向她们求婚。女性绝不会少得让你找不到妻子。”

“那么，好吧，”他说，“我是很认真的，我一定照你的话办，但是我可以先郑重地问你一句话吗？”

“什么话都可以问，”我说，“除了你已经问过的那句话。”

“不，那样回答是不行的，”他说，“总之，那正是我要问的话。”

“你爱问什么话都可以，不过那句话我已经回答了。”我说。“再说，先生，你能够这么瞧不起我，以为我对于这样一个问题，会事先回答吗？世界上能有一个女人相信你很认真，而不以为你除了与她开玩笑而没有别的用意吗？”

“好，好，”他说，“我没有与你开玩笑，我是认真的，请你想一想这事吧。”

“但是，先生，”我有点严肃地说道，“我是为我自己的事情来找你。我请你告诉我，我应当怎样去办？”

“你再来找我的时候，”他说，“我一定会想好。”

“不，”我说，“你阻止了我再来。”

“为什么呢？”他说，显出一点惊奇的神气。

“因为，”我说，“我不会为了你所说的事再来这里。”

“好，”他说，“可是，你该答应我再来这里，我绝不再谈这事了，直等到我正式离婚。但是我希望在我离婚以后，你准备过更好的生活，因为那时你必须做我的妻子，否则我根本不离婚。我之所以能够离婚，还要感谢你对我意想不到的恳挚，若没有其他的缘故，但是我还有别的理由。”

他的话再不能使我更喜欢了，然而，我懂得当事情还很渺茫的时候，要想得到他必须先不答应他，到他能够这样做的时候再去答应他，那也不会太迟。所以我很郑重地对他说，等到他有谈这事的条件时，再来考虑这些事，那也总不算迟。当下我又告诉他，我要到很远的地方去，他会找到很多更遂意的人来。我们当时谈到这里就分开了，他要我答应他第二天再来商议我的事情，经过再三的要求之后，我才答应了他。假使他把我看得更透彻些，他会看出这样再三的要求是不必要的。

于是第二天晚上我又来了，还带了我的女仆，为的是让他看看我还有一个女仆。但是我一进来，就打发她走了。他要我让女仆待在那里，但是我却不肯，大声地叫她在九点钟左右再来接我。但是他不让这样做，告诉我他要送我回家，我不大高兴他这样做，心想他这么做，或者是要知道我住在哪里，要去打听我的声名同情况。然而，我敢冒险让他到那里去，因为那里的人们知道的全是对我有利的事。在他打听之后，他能了解到的，只是我是个拥有资产的女人以及我是个守礼拘谨的人。总的说来，不管这话对与不对，你可以看出对于一切希望在世界上得点好处的女人来说，保存她们贞淑的名声，甚至当她们或许牺牲了那东西的时候，那是多么必要。

我看他替我预备了一份晚餐，因此觉得很高兴。我又看他生活很阔绰，有一所布置得很漂亮的房子。屋里的一切，我看了觉得很高兴，因为我把这些东西全看作是我的了。

关于前次我们所谈的事情，这是第二次协商了。他的确很彻底地提出他的事情。他郑重地宣布他对于我的热情，我对他真是没有怀疑的余地。他说这热情是从我和他谈话的第一刹那开始的，早在我提出将我的财产留下给他之前就已经有了这个心。“究竟从什么时候开始，那倒无关紧要，”我心里想，“只要能够持久，那就不坏了。”然后他对我说，我说把我的财产托他料理，将来留下给他这个提议多么使他感动。“我早料到这话会发生效力，”我想，“但是那时我以为你也是个独身的人。”我们吃过晚饭，他极力劝我喝两三杯酒，然而我却谢绝了，只喝了一两杯。他然后告诉我，他要向我提出一个建议，即使我不赞成，也不要见怪。我告诉他，我希望他不要向我提出卑鄙的建议，尤其是在他家里。假使是这类的建议，我请他不要提出，免得我向他表示不满，那是有违我对他的敬意以及我到他家来对他的信任。我求他让我走开，于是开始戴上手套，预备回去，虽然那时我不想走，他也不想让我走。

他恳求我不要说回去。他请我相信他绝没有打算向我提出什么卑鄙的要求，假使我那样想，那么他就不再多谈了。

这些话我听了并不高兴。我告诉他我愿听他所说的一切，相信他不会说什么与他自己不相称或者不宜于我听的话。听了这话，他告诉我他有这样的一个建议：我嫁给他。尽管他还没有和那荡妇，他的妻子，正式离婚。为了证明他的居心是光明正大的，他答应在他离婚得到批准以前，不要我同他住在一起，或者和他同床。我一听到这个建议，心里就说了个“是”字，但是在他面前还要再装一会儿君子。所以我好像还很热烈似的反对这建议，认为这办法是不妥当的，告诉他这样一个建议没有什么意义，只能使我们两人都陷入很大的困难。因为假使他最后不能达到离婚的目的，我们却又不能解除婚约，我们俩又不能继续下去。万一他的离婚失败了，我请他想一想我们俩将处在什么地位。

总之，我把这个建议反驳得十分厉害，使他觉得这是一个毫无意义的建议。他跟着放弃了这建议，又提出了另一个建议，那就是，我同他签订一个契约，还盖上图章，约好当他离婚得到批准的时候，就嫁给他。假使他不能离婚，这契约就无效。

我告诉他这个办法比较合理一些。但是我想这既是第一次，所以他这么易受感动，对于这件事竟认真起来。我是不惯于在人家第一次问我的时候就答应的，因此我要去想一想。

我玩弄这个爱人，有如一个渔夫玩弄一条鳟鱼。我看出我已经把他钩紧了，所以拿他的新建议来开玩笑，同他敷衍。我对他说，他不大了解我，叫他去打听我的情形。我还让他和我同到我寄宿的家里去，然而我并不打算请他进去，因为我告诉他这是不合适的。

总之，我大胆地躲避签订这个婚姻的契约，我所以这样做是因为那位请我跟她同到兰开夏去的太太十分积极地坚持着，应许我在那里会有很好的境遇，会得到十分美妙的东西。我真是被她说动了，想去试一下。“也许，”我说，“我可以把我的境况改善一些。”然后我就丝毫未加考虑地离开了我这位诚实的人，我并没有这么爱他，以至于舍不得离开他，去嫁给一个更富的人。

一言以蔽之，我躲避签订一个契约；却告诉他我要到北方去。我既把事情托给他，他自然会知道该往哪里给我写信。我要给他一个充分的保证，来表示我是多么尊敬他，因为我要把我世界上差不多所有的东西全交在他手里。我同他约好，只要他和他的妻子离了婚，写信向我报告一切，我就到伦敦来，那时我们就可以正式谈论这件事了。

我必须承认，我是怀着卑鄙的心计去的，虽然请我去的人怀着比我还要恶毒的心计，请看下文就可以明白了。于是我跟我的朋友（我这么称她），同到兰开夏去。在途中，她老是现出一种极诚恳、极真挚的感情，爱抚着我。一路上除了我自己的车费以外，老是她当东道。她的兄弟坐了一辆绅士用的大马车到窝灵吞来接我们，把我们从那里送到利物浦去，礼貌周到得使我感到十分满意。我们在利物浦的一位商人家里还受到三四天的款待。因为后来所发生的那些事情，我不愿说出他的名字。然后，她告诉我她要带我到她一个叔叔家里，在那里我们会受到极丰盛的款待。她带我去了，她的叔叔（她这样称呼他）派了一辆四匹马的大马车来迎接我们，带我们走了将近四十里的路，也不知道到了什么地方。

可是我们来到一位绅士的住宅，那里面有一个大家庭，有一所大花园和一些的确非常高贵的人们，在那里人家称她侄女。我告诉她如果她早打算带我到这里来，应当让我预备一下，穿几套更好的衣服。那些太太们注意到这点，很客气地告诉我她们这地方不像伦敦那样只重衣服不重人。她们的侄女已经详细地对她们说出我的身份，我用不着用衣服来增加身价。总之，她们招待我，不像实在的我，却像她们所以为的我，那就是，一个拥有大笔财产的寡妇。

我在这里首先发现这家人全是天主教徒，我认识的他们那个侄女也是。可是，我必须要说，世界上没有人能够对我招待得更周到了。我受到人家种种的礼遇，即使我真是她们所以为的人，也不过如此。说真的，我并没有任何原则在宗教问题上表示慎重，但我立刻用赞美的口气来谈天主教。尤其是，我告诉她们我看出基督教徒在信仰上种种的不同差不多全是教育上的偏见造成的。如果我父亲也是个天主教徒，我敢说我会像喜欢自己的宗教那样喜欢她们的宗教。

这使她们感激到极点，因此不分昼夜都有良好的伴侣和有趣的谈话陪伴我，其中有两三位老太太向我喋喋不休地谈论宗教。我也很有礼貌，虽然没有完全答应她们，可是却毫无顾虑地参加她们的弥撒。她们先做个榜样给我看，以后我就照着她们的样子去做，但是我也不愿太自贬身价，所以我只是稍稍鼓动她们一下，让她们来劝我变成天主教徒。假使有人拿她们所谓天主教的教义来教我的话，这事就这样拖延下去。

我在这里差不多待了六个星期，然后我的引导者领我到了一个乡村里。那里离利物浦有六里左右的路，她的兄弟（她这样叫他）到那里来拜访我，坐着他自己的四轮马车，很阔绰的样子，还有两个穿着漂亮制服的仆人。第二步他就向我求爱了。我既有了那些遭遇，人们总会想我不至于受骗了。我自己也真这样想，既然有了一个我有把握、可以得到手的人，这人我已决定不松手，除非我能够从别处得到很多好处。然而，单从表面看来，这个兄弟真是值得我留意的一个对象，他的地产的估价最低每年有一千金镑的利息，但是他的姐姐说每年可以有一千五百金镑，大部分是在爱尔兰。

我既是个拥有厚资的人，人们也这样看我，他们自然不敢来问我的财产有多少。我这位假朋友听到一句无聊的谣言，把五百金镑升到五千金镑，她来到乡间的时候，又说我的财产值一万五千金镑了。那位爱尔兰人（我听说他是那里人），看到这块肥肉，简直疯了。总之，他向我求婚，送我许多礼物，像疯子一样借债来做他求婚的费用。说句公道话，他具有极上流的绅士风采。他身材高大，样子很体面，而且谈话也极风雅。他那么自然地谈着他的花园、他的马房、他的马匹、他的狩猎人、他的森林、他的佃户和他的仆人，就好像他坐在地主的大庄园里。而我也好像看见这一切似的。

他从来没有问过我的财产或地产，却告诉我，我们到了都柏林以后，他将划出一块每年有六百金镑收入的肥地归我所有。我们在这里就可以立下一张授产的凭据，或者契约，作为将来执行之用。

这真是我从没有听过的好话，这时我的一切计划全完了。我还有个女魔鬼在怀中，她时时刻刻告诉我她的兄弟多么阔绰。她有时向我请示，问我要把我的结婚马车涂什么花样，里面衬什么样的里子。有时又来问我的侍童该穿什么衣服。总之，我给弄得眼花缭乱，已经无力再说“不”字了。简单地说，我答应了嫁给他。但是为了要秘密些，我们坐车到更偏僻的乡下，请了一个神甫替我们证婚，他们告诉我，这和英国教会的牧师替我们证婚同样有效力。

我不能说我做这事时没有想到这样舍弃了我那位老实人是很卑鄙的。他那样诚恳地爱我，正在设法和那个无耻的荡妇脱离关系。他真被她欺侮得太厉害了，确信从他新选定的这个人身上可以得到无穷的幸福。这个人现在却委身于别人，这种无耻的行为就是那个荡妇也不过如此。

但是那位曾经被我欺骗现在却来骗我的人时时展现在我眼前的那种大田产和好东西的动人远景，驱赶着我往前走，没有给我时间去想起伦敦或者那里的任何事情，更不会想到我对于那个具有无限价值的人的义务了，那人比起我目下的这个人来可有价值多了。

但是事情是做过了，我现在是在我新丈夫的怀中了，他还是和从前一样，阔绰到富丽堂皇的程度，一年没有一千金镑的收入是不能供给他通常那种车马仆从的生活的。

我们结婚差不多一个月之后，他开始谈起让我到契斯特，为的是从那里坐船到爱尔兰。可是，他没有催促我，我们又待了将近三个星期，然后他派人到契斯特订好一辆马车，在利物浦对面，他们所谓黑岩的地方等候我们。我们坐了一条好船到那里去，这船他们叫作桨篷船，有六把桨。他的仆人、马匹以及行李用渡船载行。他向我托词他没有朋友住在契斯特，于是他要先去，替我在一个私人家里租一套漂亮的房间。我问他我们在契斯特会待多久。他说，不久，不会超过一两夜，他将立刻雇一辆马车到荷里赫得去。我对他说为住一两夜，千万不要麻烦自己去找单独的寓所，因为契斯特既是个大地方，我相信那里必定有很好的旅馆和设备。所以我们就住在西街的一家旅馆，离大教堂不远，我忘记那里挂了什么招牌。

在这里，我丈夫谈起我们到爱尔兰去的事情，问我在出发之前有没有什么事要到伦敦去料理一下。我对他说，没有，没有什么要紧的事，从都柏林写信去也可以料理。“太太，”他非常恭敬地说，“我姐姐对我说过你大部分的财产是存在英国国家银行的钱，放在那里我想是很安全的，但是如果需要换存户的名字，或者改变产权的话，那么在我们出发之前，到伦敦去把这些事情料理清楚是必要的。”

我听了这话，现出很惊奇的样子，告诉他我不明白他的意思。我不知道我有什么财产存在英国国家银行里。我希望他不要说我曾经告诉过他。不，他说，我没有这样对他说过，但是他姐姐曾经说过我的大部分财产都存在那里。“我提这事，我亲爱的，”他说，“只是因为假使将来需要料理这笔钱，或者有什么调动，我们可以免得再受一次来回航行的危险和辛苦。”他还说，他不愿我常冒海行的危险。

我听了这话觉得很惊奇，开始很严肃地考虑这到底是什么意思。我立刻想到我那位称他兄弟的朋友将我捧得过分了。因此我想，一定要知道这事的根底，在我离开英国之前，在我把自己交托在异国的陌生人的手里之前，我必须把这事弄清楚。

因此第二天早上我叫他姐姐到我房里来，告诉她前天晚上她兄弟和我谈的话，恳求她告诉我她对他讲过些什么话以及她为什么来撮合这段姻缘。她自认向他说过我拥有一大笔财产，她说她在伦敦听见人家这样说的。“听见人家这样说！”我激烈地问道，“我曾对你这样说过没有？”没有，她说，我的确没有对她这样说过，但是我却对她说了好几次，我所有的钱都是由我个人支配的。“我是这样说过，”我很快地回答，“但是我从来没有告诉你我有一大笔财产。不，我在世界上只有一百金镑，或者值一百金镑的东西。我既然拥有一笔大财产，”我说，“又怎么会和你跑到英国的北方来，还不是因为这里的生活低廉吗？”我这话说得又激烈、又大声，说到这里，我的丈夫走进来，我请他进来坐下，因为我有一些要紧的话要当着他们两人的面说出。这话他是绝对有必要听的。

他看到我讲这话时的坚决态度，就现出有些不安的样子．进来先把门关好，坐在我的身旁。于是我立刻开始说话了。因为我很生气，就转过脸来对他说道：“我恐怕，我亲爱的，（我对他说话是带着善意的）你娶了我是受了很大的欺骗，受了一次绝对无法补偿的损伤，然而我既未参加这个阴谋，我应该是无罪的。那罪过应由该受罚的人去担当，不要加在别人身上，这事与我无关了。”

“我娶了你会受到什么伤害呢，我亲爱的？”他说，“我希望娶了你可以提高我的荣誉，对我有许多好处。”

“我要向你说明一下，”我说，“我想你没有理由认为自己受到公平的待遇，但是，我要请你相信，我亲爱的，”我又说，“我从没参加过这个阴谋。”

他脸上露出恐慌的神气，我相信他开始猜到下面要说的事了。但是，他脸朝着我，只说了一句，“往下说吧。”坐着不出声了，似乎要听我还会说什么似的。于是我就说下去了。“昨天晚上我问你，”我对他说，“我曾经向你夸耀过我的财产没有，或者曾向你说过我有财产存在英国国家银行和别的地方没有，你也承认我没有，那是千真万确的。我请你当着你姐姐的面，在这里说清楚，我对你说过什么话使你会这样想，或者我们曾经谈到这个事情没有？”他又承认我没有，只说我的样子一向像个拥有厚资的女人，他相信我是这样的人，希望他没有受骗。“我现在并未问你受骗没有，”我说，“我想你是受骗了。我也受骗了，但是我要洗清自己，免得让人说是我欺骗了你。”

“我刚才问过你姐姐我是不是曾经对她说过我有财产或者产业，或者详细地对她说过我的各项产业。她也承认我从来没有说过。请你，太太，”我转过来对她说，“如果你能够的话，请你很公平地当着你兄弟的面说清楚，我曾经向你假冒过我有一笔财产吗？既然我有了这笔财产，为什么还想节省我所有的一点钱而和你跑到这里来过活？”她一个字也不能否认，只说她在伦敦听人说我有一笔很大的财产，那是存在英国国家银行里的。

“现在，亲爱的先生，”我又转过身来对我的新丈夫说，“请你也公平地告诉我，谁欺骗了你和我，竟然使你相信我是拥有厚资的人，教唆你来向我求婚，结成这个婚姻？”他不能说出一个字，单是指着她。再过一会儿，他大怒起来，那是我生平从未见过的。他咒她，骂她是荡妇，用尽他所能想到的一切骂人的话。说她把他弄得倾家荡产，他说她曾告诉他我有一万五千金镑的财产，她要向他要五百金镑，作为替他找到这个配偶的酬劳。他然后又向我说，她并不是他的姐姐，从前当过他两年的姘头，她已经拿了他一百金镑，作为大部分的酬劳费，假使事情真像我所说的，他就全完了。在他愤激的时候，他发誓他要立刻让她心里的血流出来，这把她和我都吓坏了。她哭起来，说我寄宿的那家人曾经这样告诉过她。但是这使他更生气，因为她只根据一句谣言，就这样教唆他，把事情弄到这步田地。然后，他又转过身来对着我，很诚实地说，他恐怕我们两个都完了。“因为，说句坦白的话，我亲爱的，我没有财产，”他说，“我所有的钱，这个魔鬼都让我花在这套车马和仆从上面了。”她趁他专心和我谈话的机会，溜出房子，我此后再也看不见她了。

我现在和他一样惊慌，不知道说什么好。我想从许多方面考虑，我是最倒霉的，但是他说他完了，因为他没有财产，这使我只有感到失望。“哎呀，”我对他说道，“这真是一个恶毒的骗局，我们是在双重欺诈之下结婚的。看来，你是被失望所毁了，假使我真有一大笔财产，我也就被骗了，因为你说你一无所有。”

“你真的被骗了，我亲爱的，”他说，“但是你却不至于给毁了，因为一万五千金镑在这地方可以绰然有余地维持我们两人的生活。我早决定了，这笔钱里的每个小银币我都花在你身上，我不会乱用你一个先令，其余的用款我必定拿我的爱情同温柔来做补偿，我有生之日总是这样的。”

这的确是非常老实的话，我相信他是心口如一的。说到他的性情与行为，的确使我很满意。在这点上，他是不下于任何人的。但是他没有财产，而且为了这个可笑的缘故，在这地方借了债，这使他的整个前途变得阴惨可怕了。我不知道说什么好，或者自己作何打算。

我对他说，他有这么多的爱情和这样良好的性情，却这样被引到困苦里去，真是很可惜。我看除了毁灭之外我们没有别的前途。至于我，的确不幸得很，我所有的一点钱还不够我们一个星期之用。说时我掏出一张二十金镑的银行支票和十一个金币，我告诉他这是我从我那一点点的收入里攒下来的，照那个人对我所说的情形，我希望能够维持我三四年的生活。假使把我这笔钱拿去，我就不名一文了。如果一个女人袋里没有钱，他也知道必然会处于什么地位。然而，我对他说，假使他想用这些钱，他尽可以拿去。

他很关切地对我说——我想我看见他眼里含着眼泪——他不会去用这笔钱的。他憎恶把我掠夺干净，使我受苦的那个念头。相反，他还剩下五十金币，那是他在世界上唯一的财产了，他掏出来扔在桌上，叫我拿去，虽然他没有这点钱就会饿肚子。

我同样关切地答道，我不忍听他这样说。相反，假使他能够提出任何可能生活的办法，我将做我所能做的一切，我将照他所能希望的尽量节俭过活。

他求我不要再这样说，因为这会使他心慌意乱。他说他受过上等人的教育，虽然他落到现在这样穷苦的境地。现在他只想到一个办法，然而除非我能回答他一个问题，否则那也是办不到的，可是他说他并不逼着我回答。我告诉他我一定要诚实地回答他，至于他会不会感到满意，我就不知道了。

“那么，我亲爱的，坦白地告诉我，”他说，“你所有的钱够不够维持我俩相当的体面和身份？”

我一向都没有把我自己和我的境遇说出来，我感到很庆幸——不，连我的真名字我都没有说出来。不管他看起来多么善良、多么诚实，我却看到从他身上得不到什么，只得靠我知道快要用完的一点钱过活。于是我决定除了我已经承认的银行支票和十一个金币以外，藏匿起其余的一切。假使我丧失了这笔款子，而把我安置在从前他和我相会的地方，我倒是很高兴的。我实际上还有一张三十金镑的银行支票在身边，这是我带来的全部的钱，一方面为了在那里的生活费，一方面也因为不知道我会碰到什么事情。因为那个欺骗了我们俩的媒人告诉我，我在那地方不会很好地结婚的，因此无论如何我不愿意身上没有钱。这张支票我既是藏了起来，想到他的情况，其余的钱我就用得更随便些，因为我心里实在可怜他。

但是回答他的问题时，我告诉他我从来没有存心骗他，而且永远也不会骗他。我很抱歉地告诉他我所有的一点钱不够维持我们的生活，还不足维持我一个人在南方的生活，就是这个缘故我才把自己托付给那个女人。她曾经向我担保在一个我还没有到过的曼彻斯特城里，一年花六金镑左右的钱就可以得到很好的膳宿。我全部的收入每年还不过十五金镑，我想我可以靠这点收入在那里舒服地过活，等待更好的境遇来临。

他摇着头，仍然不说话，我们过了一个非常愁闷的晚上。然而，我们还是在一起吃晚餐，夜里也睡在一块儿。当我们快吃完晚餐的时候，他显得稍微好些，也快乐了一些，叫拿一瓶酒来。“好吧，我亲爱的，”他说，“虽然情形不妙，愁闷也是无补于事的。那么，你尽管放心吧，我必定想法找一条生活的路，假使你能够单独维持自己的生活，这总胜于一无所有。我该重新入世谋生。一个男子汉总该有个男子汉的想法，沮丧等于向不幸投降。”说着他斟满一杯酒，祝贺我的健康，当酒还没咽下肚子的时候，他一直拉着我的手，后来还说他最关心的就是我。

他的确具有一种诚挚殷勤的精神，这更使我心里难过。可是，那也可以聊以慰情，因为被一个君子毁了，总比被一个恶棍毁了好些。不过关于这件事，最大的失望在他那方面，因为他的确花了很多的钱，显然他是被那个拉皮条的女人骗了。首先，这个女人的卑鄙是该提一提的，她为了自己要得到一百金镑，竟忍心让他多花三四百金镑，甚至还不止。也许这是他世界上所有的财产，除了茶桌上的一些闲谈之外，她那时却丝毫没有根据来说我有什么资产。设计欺骗一个拥有厚资的女人（假使我是这样的人），这的确是很卑鄙的。贫穷的人却装出阔绰的神气也是一种欺骗，这是很坏的事。但是，情形也有些不同，这又使他可以得到原谅，因为他并不是那样一个色棍。以欺骗女人为生，或者像某些人那样，接连骗到六七份财产，然后把她们劫掠个干净，离开她们，远走高飞。他的确是个上流人，现在处于不幸同穷苦的境地，但是却曾过过舒服的日子。假使我真有一大笔财产的话，我对于这个荡妇的出卖会异常愤怒，可是说到这个男人，赠给一笔大财产真是应该的，因为他实在是个可爱的人，心地慷慨，明白事理，脾气也非常好。

那天晚上我们密谈了很久，因为我俩都不大睡得着。他后悔向我耍了那么多的手段，就像犯了什么重罪，将去受刑似的。他又要把他身边所有的钱给我，说他要去当兵，多挣些钱来。

我问他为什么这样狠心，想把我带到爱尔兰去，既然他不能够维持我在那里的生活。他双手拥抱着我。“我亲爱的，”他说，“请你相信，我绝没有打算到爱尔兰去，更没有想带你到那里去，却只想来到这儿，避一避那些听说我假冒上等人的人们的耳目，此外在我有钱还他们之前，谁也不能向我要钱了。”

“但是，那么，”我说，“我们本来打算再到什么地方去呢？”

“哎，我亲爱的，”他说，“现在我把从前打好的主意全都告诉你吧：我打算在这里先问一下你的财产状况——这我已经问过了——当你对我说出你财产的详细情况时——我早料到你会说的——我将向你找个借口暂时把我们到爱尔兰的旅行推迟。先到伦敦去一趟。然后，我亲爱的，”他说，“我决定把我的情况全部告诉你，让你知道我的确用了这些诡计，使你答应嫁给我，而现在只好请你原谅，同时告诉你我将怎样努力用将来的幸福来使你忘却这段已往的事情。”

“真的，”我对他说，“我看出你会很快地把我说服。现在使我伤心的是我的处境不能让我轻易原谅你，不能忘却你对我所施的一切诡计，来报答你这么好的心肠。但是，我亲爱的，”我说，“我们现在怎么办呢？我们两人全都毁了，既然我们没有什么可以维持生活，我们互相谅解又有什么益处？”

我们想了许多办法，但是一样也办不到，因为我们什么基础也没有。他最后求我不要再谈这事了，因为，他说我将使他心碎。于是我们谈了一点别的事情，等他最后对我做出丈夫的事情时，我们就睡觉了。

早上他在我没醒之前就起来了。真的，因为差不多整夜都没有睡，我困得很，几乎睡到早上十一点才起来。在这时候，他带了他的马匹，三个仆人，他一切的衣服同行李，溜走了，只留下一封简短、动人的信在我桌上，信的内容如下：

“我亲爱的——我是一条狗，我害了你，但是我是被一个下流的东西欺骗了，这事和我的主张以及素来的行为都是违背的。宽恕我吧，我亲爱的！我以最诚恳的心情请你原谅。我是世上最痛苦的人，因为我欺骗了你。我从前是这么有福气，居然得到了你，现在是这么不幸，不得不从你身边逃走。饶恕我吧，我亲爱的。我重复再说一遍，饶恕我吧！我不忍看你被我毁了。我无法维持你的生活。我们的婚姻等于无效，我决不能再见你了，我现在声明你再不受我们婚约的束缚，假使你能够嫁得很好，千万不要因为我的缘故而回绝。我现在以我的信仰和一个顾全廉耻的人的话做担保，向你发誓，假使我能够知道你在安逸地过活，我决不打扰你，然而我大概是无从知道的。可是，假使你没有再嫁，假使我遇到好运气，那将全归于你，无论你在什么地方。

“我把我所剩的一部分钱放在你的衣袋里，你替你自己和女仆订好公共马车的位子，到伦敦去吧，我希望这些钱够你到那里去的旅费，而不必动用你自己的钱。我还要再说一遍，我诚恳地求你原谅，我将来每想到你时，总要求你原谅。别了，我亲爱的，从此永别吧！——我是，你最亲爱的，J．E”

我生平所经历的事情没有一件像这次别离这么深切地刺伤我的心。我在心里责备他几千遍，怪他离开了我，因为我愿意跟他走遍天下，就是我向人乞讨也是愿意的。我摸了一摸我的衣袋，在里面发现十个金币，他的金表，还有两个小指环，一个是小粒钻石指环，只值六个金镑，另外是一个普通的金指环。

我坐在那里，呆望着这些东西，接连两个钟头几乎一句话也没有说，直到我的女仆告诉我午餐已经准备好了，才打断了我的沉思。我只吃了一点东西，饭后我忽然痛哭一场，喊他的名字杰姆。“呵，杰姆！”我说，“回来吧，回来吧。我将把我所有的钱全给你，我将跟你一起求乞和挨饿。”这样子我口里乱说着，在房里跑了几趟，一会儿坐下，一会儿又站起来，喊他回来，然后又哭一会儿。这样我过了整个下午，等到晚上七点钟，天快黑了（因为那时已经是八月）。忽然间我大吃一惊，他回到旅馆来了，但是没有带一个仆人，一直走到我的房间。

我心里的烦乱已达极点了，他也是这样。我想不出究竟为什么这样烦乱而开始跟自己争论，应该高兴还是悲伤。但是我的热情支配了一切，我的高兴是隐藏不了的，我高兴得不止微笑，甚至哭起来了。他一进房间，就跑到我面前，双手紧紧地拥抱着我，吻得我几乎喘不出气来，但是一句话也没有说。最后我开始问他：“我亲爱的，”我说，“你怎么能够离开我走了呢？”这句话他没有回答，因为他说不出话来了。

当我们的狂欢渐渐消逝的时候，他告诉我他走了差不多十五英里，但是继续走下去，而不回来再瞧我一下，重新向我告别，那是办不到的。

我告诉他我刚才的情形以及我怎样大声地喊他回来。他对我说他在离这儿十二里远的拉摩尔森林中已经很清晰地听到我的呼声。我微笑了。“不，”他说，“不要以为我是开玩笑，因为假使我生平听过你的声音的话，那么那时我真听到你大声喊我，有时我还以为你在后面追我呢。”

“啊，”我说，“我喊什么了？”——因为我没告诉他我喊了什么。

“你大声喊着，”他说，“呵，杰姆，呵，杰姆！回来吧，回来吧。”

我对他笑了。“我亲爱的，”他说，“不要笑，请你相信，我那时听到你的声音正像你现在听我的声音一样分明。如果你愿意的话，我可以到一个法官面前发誓这话是真的。”于是我开始感到惊奇，的确觉得很害怕，因此告诉他我实在干了些什么以及我怎样一声声地喊他。我们为这事开心了一会儿之后，我对他说：“哦，你再也不要离开我了，我愿意跟你走遍世界。”他对我说，离开我对于他是一件很难办到的事，但是既然是不可避免的，他希望我尽量不要为这事伤心。至于他，这次离别将注定他的灭亡，这一点他早已看到了。

可是，他对我说他觉得让我独自一个人到伦敦去，那行程未免太长了。而且他走那条路同走任何其他的路一样，所以他决定送我到伦敦或者附近的地方。如果那时他不辞而别，我可不要怪他。他让我答应这件事。

他告诉我他怎样辞退了他的三个仆人，卖了马匹，这些都只用了一会儿工夫，在一个我不认识的城镇里办好的。“当我想到他们比他们的主人快活得多的时候，我不禁暗自流出泪来，因为他们能够到其他的绅士家里去找差事。”他说，“而我却不知道到哪里去，也不知道怎么办好。”

我告诉他和他分离我感到十分难受，我的处境再也不能更坏了！现在他已回来，我决不离开他，假使他愿意带我走，我愿跟他到任何地方去。当下我同意一同到伦敦，但是我无法同意他最后同我不辞而别，并且开玩笑地告诉他，如果他这样做，我必定像前次那样大声地喊他回来。然后我拿出他的表和两个指环以及十个金币，一起还给他。但是他不肯收，这使我非常怀疑，他也许决定半路逃跑，离开我。

事实是，他所处的环境、他信里热情的口气、他自始至终待我深切温良的态度以及他所表示的对于我的关怀、把他剩下的大部分钱给我——这许多事件凑起来给我那么深的印象，我真不忍离开他。

两天以后，我们离开了契斯特，我乘公共马车，他骑马。我在契斯特辞退了女仆。他非常反对我辞去女仆。但是我是在本地雇来的仆人，又决定到伦敦不再用仆人，于是就告诉他，如果把这可怜的姑娘带去，一到都城又把她打发走，未免显得野蛮。而且我们在路上会多一份不必要的开支，这样我说服了他，他也就放了心。

他和我一直到了离伦敦不到三十里的但斯特不尔，那时他告诉我命运和他自己的不幸逼他不得不离开我，到伦敦去对他有些不便，其中的缘故我没有知道的必要。我看他预备要走了。我们坐的公共马车过但斯特不尔时通常是不停的，但是我请他们只停一刻钟，他们也愿意在一家旅店门口停一会儿，于是我们就走了进去。

到了旅店之后，我告诉他我只再求他一件事，那就是，他既然不能再往前走，可否答应我在这个城里跟他一起住一两个星期，在这期间我们也许能想出一些办法，免得永诀，因为那简直毁灭了我们两人的将来。此外我还有一些重要的打算提供给他，或许他觉得那是办得到的，并且对我们是有利的。

这个提议太合理了，他竟无法反对，所以他把女店主叫来。告诉她他的妻子病了，病得很厉害，不能坐公共马车再往前走了，那车子差不多快把她累死了，他问她能否替我们在私人家里找到一个地方寄住两三天，好让我休息一下，因为这旅行对我来说太劳苦了。这女店主是个好心的人，懂得礼节，十分殷勤，立刻来看我。她告诉我她有两三间非常好的房子，在这院子里很安静的一个角落里，如果我看过那房子，她相信我一定会喜欢的，而且她还可以派她的一个女仆专门伺候我。这些话说得这么亲切，我只能接受这番好意去看那房子。我很喜欢那些房子，里面的确布置得很好，看起来很舒适，于是我们付了车钱，拿出我们的行李，决定暂在这儿住下。

在这里我告诉他我现在要和他住在一起，直等到我所有的钱全用光了为止，可是绝不让他花自己的一个先令。关于这点有些善意的争论，但是我告诉他这几乎是最后一次我能和他在一起了，我只请他让我在这件事上可以自己做主，其他的一切尽可由他决定，于是他答应了。

一天黄昏的时候，我们到田里去散步，我告诉他我现在要再提一次我从前向他提过的那个建议，于是我告诉他我过去住在弗吉尼亚，我有一个婆婆，我相信她还活在那里，虽然我的丈夫已经死了好几年了。我告诉他假使我的货物中途没有损坏（我把它的数量加大了许多），我也许拥有相当的财产，就不至于让我们分开。然后我谈到移居到那里去的人们的情形，他们怎样按那地方的宪法可以得到一定数目的田地，假使得不到的话，也可以用很低廉的价钱买到田地。

然后，我向他详细地叙述移民的意义，怎样只带价值二三百金镑的英国货物，几个仆人和工具，一个勤勉的人就能够很快打下一个家庭的基础，不到几年就能置下一份产业。

我告诉他那里的土地生产些什么东西，那里的土地怎样垦殖，怎样施肥，通常怎样扩充。我证明给他看，这样一干，不到几年，我们必定会成为富人，而我们现在这样下去必定会成为穷人。

他听了我的话觉得很惊奇。差不多整整一个星期，我们都把这事当作我们谈话的题目，在那时期，我明明白白地告诉他，假使我们规规矩矩地去做，我们一定会很发达，很富足的。

然后，我告诉他，我将想什么办法去筹划三百左右的金镑。我还跟他说这是多么好的一个法子，去把我们的不幸消除，恢复我们在世界上的地位，正像我们所希望的。我还说，七年之后，假使我们活着，我们也许能够把我们的垦殖地托付给靠得住的人，而回到这里，叫他们把田地的收入寄来，我们就住在这里享用。我告诉他好几个例子，他们都是这样做的，现在都在伦敦过着非常好的生活。

总之，我极力劝他，他几乎答应了，但是老是有些事情阻碍着。直到最后他改变了整个的方针，开始用差不多相同的话来谈爱尔兰了。

他告诉我一个能够久居乡间的人，只要有些钱，在那里每年花五十金镑所得到的田地就等于在这里用两百金镑租来的田地。那里的农产是那么好，地是那么肥，假使不去积下很多钱，我们一定可以靠着那块地像一个每年有三千金镑进款的绅士在伦敦过得那样舒服。他已经筹备好了一个计策，留我在伦敦，他自己去那边尝试一下。假使他能够打下一个很好的生活基础，配得起他对于我的敬意——他深信他能够做到这样地步的——他将回来接我。

我非常害怕，根据这样一个提议，他将遵照我的话去做，那就是说，把我那一点点财产变卖，换成现金，让他带到爱尔兰去，拿来试验他的计划。但是他很正直，他一定不想用我的钱，假使我自动把钱给他，他也不会接受。在这点上他比我先下手，因为他先说，他将去那里，用他的财产来试一试，假使他看出能够有些成就，可以过活，那么当我到那里去的时候，可以把我的财产加上去，那样我们就能够过着适意的生活。但是他不愿拿我的一个先令去冒险，必定要等他先拿一小笔钱试验一下再说。他并且请我相信假使他在爱尔兰不能成功，他将来会找我，和我一起到弗吉尼亚。

他是这么一心一意地想把他的计划先试一试，我当然不能阻止他。他答应我，他到了那里，入冬就可以告诉我他的消息，让我知道他的前途是否像他所预期的那样顺利。倘若没有成功的可能，我就可以早些预备我们到那里去的旅行，他请我相信，那时他将万分甘愿和我到美洲去。

我只能使他答应这一点，再进一步是不可能的。可是，这种讨论让我们消耗了几乎一个月的时光，在这时期，他能够天天和我相伴，那的确是我生平所感到的最有趣的事情。这段时间里，他告诉了我他生活的全部历史，那真够惊人的，充满了无限的花样，就里面的冒险和风波而言，足够编成一部历史，精彩处胜于我所读过的一切传奇。我后面还有机会再仔细地谈他。

我们最后分手了，虽然我感觉极端的难分难舍。真的，他告别时也是万不得已，但是事实逼迫着他，因为他不上伦敦去的理由是很充足的，我后来更知道得清楚了。

我告诉他怎样寄信给我，可是我仍然保守着那个绝大的秘密，那就是不让他知道我的真姓名，我是什么人，或者在哪里可以找到我。他同样告诉了我怎样寄信给他，他说，这样他一定能收到我的信。

我们分手后的第二天我来到伦敦，但是并未直接回到我从前的公寓，却为了一种说不出的理由，寄宿在克拉肯威尔邻近的圣约翰街上一个私人家里，这里就是通常所谓的圣琼斯街。在这里，我处于非常孤独的环境，反而有闲暇坐下来，认真考虑最近这七个月来我所经历的流浪生活，因为我在外面的确待了很久。我回想起与我最近这个丈夫同过的快乐时光，感到无限的欢欣。但是过了些时候发现我怀孕了的时候，这种欢欣就大大减少了。

这真是一件令人烦恼的事情，因为有个困难摆在我的面前，那就是在哪里可以找到个生产的住所。一个漂泊的女人，没有朋友，没人担保，在生产的时候要想有人家收留她，在当时是件最难办到的事。

我一向总是留心和银行里我那位诚实的朋友保持通信，或者说他留心和我保持通信好些，因为他每星期总写一封信给我。虽然我没有把钱花得那么快，以至于要他寄款，我还是常写信，让他知道我还活在人间。在兰开夏地方我留下我的通信处，所以他寄给我的信都转递到我手里，当我隐在圣琼斯街的时候，我接到他一封非常诚挚的信，告诉我他和他妻子的离婚案进行得很顺利，虽然他遭遇到一些他起先没有料到的困难。

我听说他那案子比他所预料的要麻烦得多，却觉得高兴。因为虽然我现在的情形不容我嫁他——我既知道自己跟另一个男人怀了孕，当然不至于傻得去嫁他，像我知道的有些女人所干的——可是我也不愿失掉他。总之，我下定决心，假使他仍然不变心，一复原，我就立刻嫁他，因为我明白我再也得不到我那个丈夫的音信了。他既然总是劝我嫁人，并且告诉我他绝不会因此生气，或者要求我再归于他，所以假使我能够的话，假使我那位朋友坚守他的誓言的话，我毫不犹疑地决定嫁人。从他所写的那些最诚恳最亲切的信看来，我有很多的理由可以相信他会坚守誓言的。

我现在肚子渐渐大了，我寄宿的那家人家看出来了，开始提出这点，并且在礼貌所允许的范围之内，暗示我想法搬家。这使我极端烦恼，愁闷不堪，因为我真不知道走哪条路好。我有钱，但是没有朋友，我现在要去抚养一个孩子，这是我从来没有遇到过的一个困难，从前面叙述的细节里就可以看出。‘

在这事情尚未解决的时候，我害了大病，我的忧虑的确更增添了我的病。我的病最后证明只不过是疟疾，但是我真怕流产。我不该说怕，因为我原该高兴流产的，但是设法流产，这个念头我不忍去想，想到这个念头我就觉得憎恶。

然而，谈到这点的时候，开公寓的女人向我提议去找个产婆来。我起先有些踌躇，但是过了一会儿就赞成了这个办法，并且告诉她我没有什么特别相熟的产婆，所以就让她去办。

这位女房东似乎并不像我所想象的那样完全不懂得这类事情，这一点现在就可以看出来了，她请来了一个很合适的产婆——是对我非常合适。

这个女人看起来是个对于她的本行很有经验的人，我指的是关于接生的事。但是她还有一个职业，在这方面，她能干的程度不下于大多数的女人，即使没有超过她们的话。我的房东告诉过她，我很愁闷，她相信这就增加了我的病。她有一回当着我的面对她说道，“B太太，我相信这位太太的烦恼你很能够帮忙，假使你肯帮忙的话，请你帮助她一下，因为她是个非常可亲的上等女人。”说完这话，她就走了出去。

我真不了解她的意思，但是她离开之后，这位产婆很慎重地开始解释她这些话的意思。“太太，”她说，“你好像不了解你房东说这些话的意思，当你明白了这些话的意思之后，你也用不着让她知道你明白了。

“她的意思是你的环境使你的分娩有些困难，因此你不愿让人知道。我用不着再多说了，我只想告诉你，假使你觉得应该把有必要让我知道的那些问题告诉我——我实在不想故意去探听这类事情——我或许能够帮你的忙，使你完全可以放心，去掉你对这件事的一切烦虑。”

这女人所说的每句话对于我都是一滴滴的甘露，把新生命和新精神灌注到我的心中。我的血立刻开始沸腾，我完全是另一个人了。我又吃得下东西了，此后立刻好了许多。她还跟我说了许多同样意思的话，劝我坦白地告诉她，她还以最严肃的态度答应保守秘密。她然后停了一会儿，好像要看一看这类话对我会有什么作用，我要说什么话。

我深深感到我正需要这么一个人，自然会采纳她的意见。我告诉她，我的情形一半是像她所猜的，一半不是，因为我的确结了婚，有丈夫，虽然当时他离我那么远，不能公开地出现。

她打断我的话，告诉我这不是她的事。所有请她来接生的太太在她看来都是结了婚的女人。“每个怀孕的女人，”她说，“总有个男人做那小孩的父亲。”至于这位父亲是丈夫或者不是丈夫，那不是她的事。她的事只是帮助处在目前这种情况下的我，不管我有没有丈夫。“因为，太太，”她说，“有个不能出现的丈夫等于没有丈夫，所以，你到底是个正式妻子还是一个姘头，对于我都是一样。”

我立刻看出，无论我是个荡妇还是个妻子，我现在总是被人当作荡妇看待，所以也就听其自然。我对她说她的话不错，但是如果我必须告诉她我的情形，我自然要把实情一一说出。于是我尽量简短地告诉她，我最后对她说了底下这几句话。“我告诉你这许多话，太太，”我说，“并不是像你前面所说的，因为你对这事多么关心，而是为了要让你知道，我并不在乎是否被人看见，那于我都是一样的。我的困难是，在此地没有一个熟人。”

“我懂得你的意思，太太，”她说，“没有人帮助你防止教区人员对这类事情所常取的那种无礼举动，也许你还不大知道这个孩子出生以后该怎样打发。”“后面这点倒不如前面那一点更使我忧虑。”我说。“啊，太太，”那产婆答道，“你敢把自己信托给我吗？我住在某某地方，虽然我没有打听你，你可以打听一下我是什么人。我的名字叫B，我住在某某街上，她说出那个街的名字，门口的招牌是‘摇篮’。我的职业是产婆，有许多太太来到我家生产。我向教区人员担保，在我家里无论发生什么事，来我这里生产的人们，都可以免受攻击。关于这整个事情，我只要问一句话，太太，”她说，“假使这句话会有个圆满的答复，你对于其他一切尽可以完全放心。”

我立刻懂了她的意思，对她说道：“太太，我自信我了解你的意思。谢谢上帝，虽然我在此地缺少朋友，我倒不缺钱用，这也只是单就必需的钱来说，其实我也不很富裕。”我加上这句话，因为我不想使她希望得到很多的钱。“唉，太太，”她说，“我的确是指这个东西，办这种事没有这东西真是一筹莫展。你要知道我绝不欺骗你，或者提出对不住你的要求，假使你要预先知道一切情形，那也可以，那么你可以按照你的力量去办，既不太费，也不太省。”

我告诉她，她似乎也了解我的情形，我有足够的钱，但是并不太多，所以希望她办得越省越好。

她说她将带来一张开有两三等分娩费的单子，像菜单一样，我可以随意挑选。我就请她带来。

第二天她带来了。她那三种价目单如下：

1.在她家寄宿三个月，我的伙食在内，

每星期以十先令计算…………………………………… 6镑

2.分娩那一个月所雇的看护妇，小孩床铺上

被褥的租费………………………………………1镑10先令

3.请牧师替小孩施洗礼，教父和书

记的钱……………………………………………1镑10先令

4.施洗礼那天的晚餐，估计有五位朋友

参加……………………………………………………… 1镑

她的接生费，以及她给教区人员的

应酬金…………………………………………… 3镑3先令

付给那个伺候我的女仆………………………………10先令

共计13镑13先令

这是第一种价目单。第二种价目单也包括同样的项目：

1.三个月的膳宿费等等，每星期以20先令

计算………………………………………………………12镑

2.分娩那一个月所雇的看护妇，衣服同花边的

租费………………………………………………2镑10先令

3.请牧师替小孩施洗礼等等，如前单…………………… 2镑

4.晚餐点心等……………………………………… 3镑3先令

她的酬金，如前单……………………………… 5镑5先令

一个女仆…………………………………………………1镑

共计25镑18先令

这是第二种价目单。她说第三种更讲究一些，是小孩的父亲或者朋友们在场的：

1.三个月的膳宿费，有两间房子同一间给仆人住的

顶楼………………………………………………………30镑

2.分娩那一个月所雇的看护妇，小孩床铺上最讲究的

被褥……………………………………………… 4镑4先令

3.请牧师替小孩施洗礼等等………………………2镑10先令

4.一次晚餐会，男人喝的酒从外面叫来，

不计在内………………………………………………… 6镑

她的酬金等等………………………………… 10镑10先令

女仆一人，她们自己的女仆在外……………………10先令

共计53镑14先令

我看了这三个单子，微笑了一下，对她说道，我看她的价钱是非常公道的，整个盘算一下，相信她的待遇是很好的。

她对我说，我亲自尝试以后，就会看出好坏。我告诉她我很抱歉，我免不了要做她的最低级的顾客。“也许，太太，”我说，“你会因此不大欢迎我。”

“不，绝不，”她说，“因为我得到一个第三等的顾客，我能得到两个第二等的，还能得到四个第一等的，所以一比起来，我从第三种的主顾所挣来的钱还是同样的多。如果你怕我对你不好，你可以让你的任何朋友来看一看，我待你究竟好不好。”

然后她把账目的细节解释给我听。“首先，太太，”她说，“你要注意，三个月的膳宿费，每星期只要你十先令，我敢说你不会对我所定价钱感到什么不满。我想你现在所住的地方并不比这里便宜。”

“是的，”我说，“的确没有这么便宜，我每星期就要花六先令的租钱，伙食还要我自己去解决，这也费了我不少钱。”

“那时，太太，”她说，“假使小孩子生下来死了，你知道这种情形有时也是难免的，那么牧师这笔款就省下了。假使没有朋友来看你，你也可以省下那顿晚餐的钱。所以把这几项除开之外，你的分娩一切算在内和你通常的生活费一比起来，至多超不过五镑三先令。”

这是我生平听到的最合理的事情。所以我微笑了，对她说，我决定做她的主顾，但是我又告诉她，因为我还要过两个多月才生产，我也许要在她那里住三个多月，我想知道在我还不能离开那里之前，她会不会一定要我搬走。不，她说。她的屋子很宽大，而且她从来没有让生产的人搬走过，总是等到她们自动地搬出去。假使有许多太太要来她这里，她和邻居也要好，必要的话，她总能找到二十个人的住处。

我看出在这行里她是个出色的人物。总之，我答应把自己交托给她。然后，她谈到别的事情，打听我现在所受的待遇，认为伺候不周，设备不良，说在她家里我不会受到这种待遇。我对她说我不好意思说出来，这家的主妇自从我怀孕以后，对我疏远起来，至少我是这样感觉的。我恐怕她以为我不好意思说出我的身世，怕招来什么侮辱。

“哈，”她说，“那位太太对这类事倒不外行，她过去也想招待几个像你这样的太太，但是她无法防止教区人员。而且，她并不像你所想象的那么规矩。不过，你既然要搬走，就犯不着和她争论。你到我这里我会想法好好照顾你，而且也不会使你多花钱。”

我简直不明白她的意思。然而，我向她道谢，我们就这样分手了。第二天早上，她派女仆给我送来一只热腾腾的烧鸡，一瓶白葡萄酒，还叫这女仆告诉我我还住在这里的时候，她每天总要来伺候我。

她实在太殷勤、太仁慈了，我非常愿意接受这番好意。晚上，她又派女仆到我这里来，问我需要什么东西，我的病情如何，叫女仆早上去告诉她，我午餐要什么菜。这女仆还奉命在早上回去之前替我做了一杯巧克力茶，中午她又给我送来一整块小牛肉和一盘汤做我的午餐。这位太太这样远远地看护着我。我非常高兴，于是很快地就复原了，因为从前的苦闷的确是我生病的原因。

我猜想，像她这种人派来的女仆大概是德鲁立巷里长大的一种轻浮无耻的下流女子，因此我非常不放心和她在一块儿。所以第一天晚上我无论如何不肯让她睡在屋里，处处留神，仿佛她是个小偷似的。

我这位太太立刻猜出是怎么一回事，于是打发这女仆带了一封短信来，信上说我尽可以相信她女仆的诚实，她对于这女仆的一切行为负完全责任，没有可靠的担保，她是绝不雇用的。于是我完全放心了。那个女仆的行为的确使人很满意，因为再也找不出一个更有礼貌、更温和、更规矩的女仆了，我后来还是觉得她是这样的。

我的身体复原，能够外出的时候，我就和那个女仆去看那房子，去看我将来要住的房间。那里所有的东西都是那么漂亮，那么干净，总之，我是无话可说的，只是对于我这次的遭际感到出奇地高兴，再想到我所处的可怜的环境，更觉得这是远远超过我原来的想象的。

读者也许希望我说一说现在掌握着我的这个女人的罪恶行为，但是让世人看出多么容易就可以使女人释去秘密生下孩子的重负，那就未免太鼓励作恶了。这位假正经的妇人惯做几种事情，其中的一种就是，假使一个小孩生下来，虽然不是在她家里生的（因为她有时免不了被人请到家里做许多秘密的工作），她手边也有些人为了一点钱就从她们手上接过孩子，而且不会落到教区人员的手里。据她说，这些孩子是被好好抚养着的。照她说，她经手的小孩很多，这些孩子究竟下落如何，我是不能想象的。

关于这件事我和她谈了好几次，但是她口口声声地说，她救了多少天真的羔羊的性命，否则他们也许会被屠杀的。她还救了多少女人的性命，否则她们被不幸的遭遇弄得绝望了，也许会杀死她们的小孩。我承认这是实在的情形，假使这些可怜的孩子落在好人的手里，不受保姆的欺负和虐待，这办法倒是值得赞美的。她说，她总是留心这一点，所用的保姆没有一个不是很好的老实人，都是非常靠得住的。

我不能用什么话来反驳她，只好说：“太太，我相信你会尽你的责任，但是这些女人后来怎样看待小孩，却是个大问题。”她又堵住我的口说，她极端注意这件事。

在她关于这件事的谈话里，唯一使我听了不愉快的是，有一回当提到我已经怀胎日久的时候，她说了一些话，意思仿佛是，假使我愿意，她能够帮助我早些去掉这个麻烦。或者说得明白点，假使我想去掉麻烦，她能给我一点药使我流产。但是我很快告诉她，我非常厌恶这个念头。但是说句公道话，她摆脱得很巧妙，我不能说她真有这个意思还是仅仅提到这个办法，并说明这是多么可怕的事情。因为她的话说得十分灵巧，她很快就了解了我的意思，没等我说出来她就首先反对这个办法了。

那就把这段事实用最简短的话来叙述一下吧。我搬出圣琼斯街的住所，到了新保姆的家里，在这里大家都是这样称呼她的。到了那里她真是对我太客气了，很小心地照顾我，一切供应那么完备，使我觉得非常惊奇，而起先竟看不出这位保姆究竟有什么利益可图。后来她自认她不从寄宿人的膳费里赚钱，她在这方面的确也赚不了多少。但是她却从她经营的其他事项里赚钱，而且赚得很不少。因为她在外面和在家里所做的事，几乎令人无法可信，无非是秘密营业，或者说得露骨些，就是卖淫的勾当。

我住在她家里将近四个月的期间，居然有十二位贪欢的女人来她家里生产，还有大约三十二位由她照顾的女人，住在别人家里，其中有一个，她待她也像待我那么好。她住在圣琼斯街的一个旧房东家里。

这是近世罪恶加增的一个奇怪的证据，就连坏到我这步田地的人，也感到触目惊心。我开始厌恶我所住的地方，尤其厌恶这种邪恶的生意。然而我必须承认，我住在那里的整个期间绝没有看见过，而且我相信也绝不会看见一点不正当的事情。

这里的人从来没有看到一个男人走到楼上，除非是那些去看他们分娩的妻子的男人，就是这个时候，也必定有这位老太太陪着他们。她认为任何男人都不能和生产的女人接触，连他自己的妻子也算在内，否则就与她管理的名声有关。她也决不允许任何男人用任何借口在她家里睡觉，不，即使同他自己的妻子在一起。她常常说：“不管有多少小孩在她屋里出生，她却不愿有一个是在她那里做成的，假使她能够阻止的话。”

这话也许说得太过了些，然而这只是个为求安全，故意犯下的错误，如果这算是错误的话。因为用了这个法子，她保全了她现在营业的名誉，得到这么一个声名：虽然当她们被奸污了以后，她的确照顾了那些女人，然而她绝不是她们的被奸污的导线。可是她所干的还是一种邪恶的生意。

当我住在这里还未分娩的时候，我得到我银行里财产保管人的一封信，满纸都是亲切恳挚的话，诚恳地劝我回伦敦去。这封信差不多经过了两星期才到我手里，因为先送到兰开夏，然后才转到我这里。他最后告诉我，他已经得到和他妻子离婚的判决书，假使我肯嫁给他的话，他准备实践他对我的诺言。此外还写了许多表明自己亲切热情的话，假使他晓得了我近来的情况，他绝对不会说这样的话的。我既处在这样的环境里，实在不配听他这番诚恳的话。

我写了一封回信，发信的地址写的是利物浦，是派人送去的，说这封信是放在信封里托城里一位朋友转交的。我祝贺他获得自由，但是对他再娶是否合法产生了一些怀疑，告诉他我想他会非常严肃地考虑这一点，然后再作决定。这事的关系太大了，像他这样洞明事理的人，原不该鲁莽冒昧地行动。这封信就这样结束了，最后我还祝他打算作的事情都能顺利成功。我丝毫没有让他了解我的心情，对于他所提议我到伦敦去的事也未作任何答复，只是隐约说出我在下半年会去伦敦的意思，写这封信的日期是四月。

我在五月中旬分娩了，又生了个强壮的男孩，我自己的健康也像前几次分娩时一样良好。我保姆的接生技术是极熟练巧妙的，远胜于我所见过的一切产婆。

我临产和产后，她照顾我非常尽心，即使她是我的母亲，也不过如此。谁也不要因为听到这位太太很会处置，就更加胆大地去做荒唐事。现在她已经去世了，我敢说再也没有人能够赶得上她。

大约在我产后二十天，我又接到银行里那位朋友的一封信，报告我一个惊人的消息：他已得到最后判决，准许他同妻子离婚了，他已把这个判决书给她看过了。关于我对他重婚的一切顾虑，他给了我一个答复，那是出乎我意料的，也是他所不愿的。因为他妻子原也后悔不该那样待他，一听到他打赢了官司，就在当天晚上自杀了。

他对她这个不幸的结局表示很悲伤，但是却表白自己跟这事毫不相干。他受尽凌辱和欺压是尽人皆知的，因此只求公平解决。然而，他说他现在感到极端痛心，在这个世界上看不出可以使他满意的前途了。他只希望我能来，与他做伴以减少他的痛苦。他接着极力求我给他一点希望，最少也要答应到城里来，让他看看我，那时他可以进一步向我谈结婚问题。

我听到这个消息，非常震惊，开始认真地考虑我目前的情况和我这个无法形容的不幸，那就是，我手上有个小孩子，我不知道怎样处理才好。最后我隐约地把我的事情向我的保姆说了。有好几天我愁闷不安，她不断地问我到底什么事情使我烦恼。过去我既然常常对她说我有丈夫，现在告诉她有人向我求婚，是万万不能的，所以我真不知道怎么说好。我对她承认有些事情使我非常焦急，但是同时我又告诉她，我不能向世界上任何人说出这事。

有好几天她总是向我喋喋不休，但是我对她说，那是办不到的，要我把这秘密暗地里告诉任何人，那是办不到的。这话对她不仅不能算个答复，反而使她更加追问起来。她说曾经有人将最秘密的事委托给她，替人隐藏秘密，是她分内的事。假使泄露出去，就把她自己毁了。她问我曾经听过她向我随便说起别人的事情没有，那么我怎么会信不过她呢？她对我说，把我自己的事告诉她和没有向人说一样，她一向守口如瓶。如果她不能帮助我，那倒是一件奇怪的事情。假使我把这秘密隐藏起来，倒是我自己放弃得到一切可能的帮助或者办法，而她也就没有替我出力的机会了。总之，她具有这样迷人的口才，这样劝人的力量，我简直无法向她隐瞒。

于是我决定向她剖腹相告。我对她详细叙述了我在兰开夏结婚的经过，我们俩怎样都感到了失望。我们起先怎样相遇。后来怎样分手。他怎样摆脱我，任我随意改嫁，即使他知道，也绝不来干涉，或者把我的事情说出去以及我虽然觉得自己自由了，但是却十分害怕，不敢冒昧行动，担心倘被发觉，会带来不堪想象的后果。

然后我告诉她现在有个很好的人向我求婚，我给她看我朋友最近来的请我到伦敦去的信。让她看看这些信写得多么真挚诚恳，不过我却涂去了他的名字，连他妻子自杀的那一段也涂去了，只留她死了这一句。

她大笑起来，笑我对于再嫁的问题还这么顾虑，还告诉我那并不算结婚，只是双方凑成的一个骗局。我们既然彼此同意分开，婚约就算解除了，双方的责任也都一笔勾销。她的理由真是太充足了。总之，她说服了我，使我放弃了自己的主张。自然我自己原也这么打算。

然而那个很大的、主要的困难来临了，就是小孩的问题。她劝我必须把孩子扔掉，而且要办得妥当，任何人也不能发现。我也知道，不把我有孩子这事隐瞒起来，是谈不到结婚的，因为他很快会从孩子的年龄看出他出生的时间，他的出世，是在我同他谈判之后，这样就会把事情弄糟了。

但是一想到与我的孩子分离，让他被人杀害或者因为没人管而饿死（两者是一样的），我心里感到非常难过。我每想起这事，总觉得恐怖。我希望那些为了面子，把小孩打发到所谓别的地方去的女人们想一想，这只是一种巧妙的谋杀，也就是说，用最妥当的办法杀死她们的孩子。

凡是知道一些孩子的事情的人都明白，我们降生到世界上时是毫无办法的，不能供给我们自己的需要，甚至连使人知道我们的这些需要也不可能。假使得不到扶助，我们一定活不了。这种扶助不只需要一个扶助人，母亲也好，别人也好，这个扶助人还得具有两个不可缺少的条件：细心和技能。没有这两个条件，生下来的孩子虽然并不缺少食物，可是大半都会死去．而且活下来的孩子也大半都要变成残废或者傻子，损伤了他们的肢体或者他们的智慧。我相信主要是因为这些缘故，“自然”才在母亲的心里种下了慈爱的种子。假使没有这种母爱，她们绝不肯牺牲自己，辛辛苦苦地去抚养她们的子女。

这种照料既然对婴孩的生命是不可缺少的，不管他们就等于屠杀他们。把他们送到心里“自然”没有种下慈爱种子的人们手里，就等于丝毫不管他们。而且，有时甚至更进一步，故意把孩子丢弃。所以不管孩子是死是活，这都算是有意谋杀。

所有这些问题现在都出现在我的眼前，显得黑暗、可怕。我和我的保姆既然非常要好，我现在又叫她母亲了，所以就把心里话全告诉了她。她对于这事仿佛比对其他的事慎重得多。但是她对这些事情已经看惯了，绝不会被宗教的信仰和杀人的顾虑所感动，也不会被慈爱之情所打动。她问我，在我分娩的时候，她对我是不是很细心、很周到，好像我是她自己的女儿一样。我告诉她，我承认这一点。“可是，我亲爱的，”她说，“你一走，我们之间不是没有关系了吗？就是你被判绞刑，与我又有什么相干？你不以为世界上有些女人，把抚养孩子作为职业，靠着这个吃饭，就对小孩像母亲一样地细心照顾，并且以此为荣吗？确实有，孩子，不要害怕，”她说，“我们从前是怎样被养大的呢？你敢说你是你母亲抚养成人的吗？可是，你长得又强壮，又漂亮，孩子。”说到这里，这位老妇人摸了摸我的脸。“别担心，孩子，”她继续开玩笑说，“我身旁并没有刽子手，我雇用的都是最好的、最老实的乳母，她们照顾的小孩很少出毛病，就算由他们自己的母亲抚养，也不过如此，在细心和技能两方面她们都不算差。”

当她问我敢不敢说我是我母亲抚养成人这句话时，她的确刺痛了我的心，其实我很明白我不是我母亲养大的。我一听这句话，就浑身打战，脸色变得苍白。我心想，这个老东西不会是个女巫，不会同什么精灵有关系，在我自己还不知道之前那精灵就会告诉她我的遭遇。我望着她，好像是吓呆了，但是又一想她绝不会知道我的事情，就开始放心了，但这不是立刻做到的。

她看出我心里慌张，但是不懂得其中的意思，所以她仍然信口开河地说下去。她说我以为小孩子不由母亲抚养，就等于被谋杀，这种理由未免太不充足。她请我相信她所看管的小孩子都受到良好的待遇，就像他们的母亲亲自抚养一样。

“这也许是真的，母亲，”我说，“我是无话可驳的，但是我的怀疑却有很充足的理由。”

“那么，”她说，“说出来给我们听吧。”

“是啊，第一，”我说，“你把一些钱给这些人，叫她们把小孩从母亲手里领去，只要孩子活一天，就照顾一天。我们既然知道，母亲，”我说，“这些人是穷人，她们当然希望早一天把这个负担去掉，既然孩子死去对她们最有利，那么她们对小孩的生命怎么会太关心呢？”

“这些想法全是无中生有，”这老妇人说道，“我告诉过你，她们的名誉全靠小孩来维持，她们的细心也不下于你们这些做母亲的。”

“啊，母亲，”我说，“假使我真知道我的小孩受人细心照顾，没有吃亏，我的确会很高兴。但是除非我看见他，否则我是无法放心的，就我现在的情形而论，去看他，我就会遭到毁灭，所以我不知道怎么办好。”

“这真是一篇妙论！”我的保姆说道，“你想看这孩子，又不想看这孩子。你想把这事隐藏起来，又想让人知道。这是不可能的，我亲爱的。所以你必须也像其他有天良的母亲一样去做，形势既然非此不可，也只好如此了。虽然不像你所期望的那样如意。”

我明白她所谓有天良的母亲是什么意思。她原想说有天良的妓女，不过她不愿得罪我，因为我的确不是个妓女，我已经合法地结了婚，假使把前一次的婚约撇开不算的话。可是，无论我是什么人，我的心还没有像做妓女的那么麻木。我是说，违背了天性，不管我孩子生命的安全。我一直保守着这个真情，我几乎决心弃掉银行里的那个朋友。但是他却老是劝我去找他、嫁他，总之，我几乎没有回绝他的余地。

最后我的保姆又来找我，态度仍然是很自信的样子。

“啊，我亲爱的，”她说，“我找到了一个办法，既可以保证你的孩子不受虐待，照顾这孩子的人也永远不会知道你。”

“啊，母亲，”我说，“假使你能办到，我对于你真是永远感激。”

“可是，”她说，“除了我们通常给这些人的钱之外，你每年肯多花一点钱吗？”

“可以，”我说，“我很愿意，假使我可以不让人知道的话。”

“关于这一点，”我的保姆说，“你尽可以放心，因为那保姆简直连你的姓名也不敢问，你一年中可以和我去看你的孩子一两回，看看人家怎样待他，你好放心，但是绝没有人知道你到底是谁。”

“怎么，”我说，“母亲，你以为我来看我的孩子的时候，还能瞒得过我是他的母亲吗？你想这是可能的吗？”

“即使你露了些神色，”我的保姆说道，“那保姆也绝不会知道什么，因为不许她探问别人的事情。她要违反命令的话，她就得不到你答应另外给她的钱，孩子也不再让她管了。”

听了这段话，我非常高兴。第二个星期她就从赫特福德或者那附近的地方找来一个乡下女人，这女人得到十个金镑，就把孩子领去，使他永远不再麻烦我了。假使每年我再另外给她五个金镑，我什么时候想看孩子，她就得把他送到我保姆家里，或者我到乡下，看她怎样对待孩子。

这是个很善良的女人，看来干这事很合适。她丈夫是个小佃农，但是她穿的衣服却很好，一切打扮也都很讲究。我于是怀着一颗忧郁的心，流了许多眼泪，让她把孩子抱去了。我自己还到过一趟赫特福德，去看了她和她的屋子，一切我都很喜欢。我答应她，如果她对孩子好的话，我一定给她很多好处，所以她一听我的话，就知道我是这孩子的母亲。但是她住得那么远，也似乎无法去打听我的事情，我想我是安全的。总之，我给她十个金镑，让她把孩子带走，那就是说，我把这钱给我的保姆，她当着我的面给了这个穷女人，这女人答应绝不把孩子退还给我，或者还向我要钱做他的赡养费或者抚育费。不过我答应她，假使她照顾孩子非常周到，我每回来看他的时候，一定再给她钱。所以我不是非付这五镑钱不可，不过我向我的保姆说定我是一定要付的。这样我的最大烦恼总算过去了，虽然一点也不称意。可是就我那时的情形而论，这还是对我最方便的一个办法。

然后我开始用更亲切的口气给我银行里的朋友写信，尤其在六月初的时候，寄去一封信，说我预备在八月到城里去。他回我一封信，里面全是最热情的话，希望我到时候先通知他，他可以来接我，他还以为我得走两天的路程呢。这真把我窘住了，不知道用什么话去回答他。有一次我决定坐公共马车到契斯特去，为了可以从那里回来，让他看到我的确是从外面来的。因为我很不放心——虽然没有什么根据——让他以为我并未真正住在乡下。

我极力用道理来劝自己不要这么办，但是终于无用。那印象这么强烈地刻在我的心上，真是无从抵抗。最后，我又想起一点，更说明我到乡下去这个计划的好处，那就是可以哄骗我这老保姆，而把我其他的事情全遮盖住，因为我的新爱人住在伦敦还是兰开夏，她一点也不知道。我告诉她我这个选择的时候，她完全相信他是在兰开夏的。

打好了这主意以后，我就告诉了她，并且让那个一开头就伺候我的女仆到公共马车上替我占一个位子。她让这女仆伺候我，一直到最后一站，然后再坐运货的马车回来，但是我告诉她这却有些不便。她对我说，我走之后，她不必想办法与我通信，因为她明知道，我对孩子的感情一定会使我给她写信，也会去找她的。我请她相信，我一定这样办。这样我就告别了，深自庆幸能够离开这个人家，尽管我在那里受到很好的待遇。

我坐公共马车并未坐到终点，却只坐到折细耳一个叫作斯顿的地方。在那里我不单是没有丝毫的事情，而且也没有一个认识的人。可是我知道有钱在口袋里，可以走遍天下。所以我在那里住了两三天，等机会来临，又在另外一辆公共马车上找到位子，回伦敦去了。事先我写了一封信给我这位先生，告诉他我于某日会到司汤立司脱拉福，那是车夫对我说的，我们将在那里过夜。

我所坐的这辆车恰巧是个不定时的马车，几个到爱尔兰去的绅士特意雇来拖到契斯特，现在正回来了，所以不是按照公共马车的时间和地点走的。因为星期日停着不走，所以他才有时间预备好出来，不然他是办不到的。

然而，他收到通知的时候却太迟了，他不能赶到司汤立司脱拉福和我一起过夜，却在第二天早上当我们刚要进城的时候，在一个叫布立克喜尔的地方遇到我。

我承认看见他我很高兴，因为我昨天晚上的确感到有点失望。他来时的阔绰气派更使我加倍地高兴，因为他坐着一辆很华美的四匹马的绅士马车，还跟着一个仆人。

公共马车到了布立克喜尔的一家客栈门口停下了，他立刻领我下来。走进这家客栈，他把他自己的马车赶到里面，然后就吩咐伙计预备饭。我问他为什么这样办，因为我本打算一直走下去的。他说，我途中需要休息一下，虽然这只是个很小的城市，可是这家客栈很好，这样，那天晚上我们就住下了。

我也没有怎样拒绝，因为他既然这么远来接我，自己又花了很多钱，照道理来讲，我也该将就他一些。所以关于这点，我就顺从了他的意思。

饭后，我们走出去看了看城里的景物，瞻仰了一下礼拜堂，又看了看田野和乡下，这都是异乡人常做的事。我们去瞻仰礼拜堂的时候，客栈的主人做了我们的向导。我听见我这位先生问了他许多关于牧师的问题，我立刻猜到，他一定会提议结婚的。于是我立刻就打定了主意，决不拒绝他。因为，坦白地说，看看我目前的境况，我实在不能拒绝他。我现在没有理由再冒这样的险了。

但是当这种思想在我头里打转的时候——那只是几分钟的事——我看客栈的主人拉他走开，向他咬耳朵，可是声音并不太低，因为我听到这么句话：“先生，假使你想找——”其余的我虽然没听清，但好像是这样的意思：“先生，假使你想找牧师，附近我有一位朋友可以为你效劳，你爱多么秘密，就多么秘密。”我这位先生回答的声音很大，我听见他说：“很好，我相信我将有找他的必要。”

我们一回到客栈，他立刻用不可抗拒的热情对我说，他既然很幸运遇到我，一切事情又都这么凑巧，假使我肯在这里把这件事结束，那会使他的幸福更早实现。“你这话是什么意思？”我说，脸稍微红了一下。“怎么，在客栈里，在路上？上帝保佑我们！”我说道，“你怎么能这样说呢？”

“啊，我就要这样说，”他说，“我来就是为了这样说的。我可以证明给你看。”说着，他拿出一大捆纸。

“你吓坏我了，”我说，“这一大捆是什么东西？”

“别害怕，我亲爱的，”他说，一面吻着我。这是第一次他居然毫不拘谨地叫我“亲爱的”。然后他又重复了一遍，“别害怕，一会儿你就会知道这是什么。”接着他就把这捆纸打开。首先是和他妻子离婚的文件或者判决书，还有她当姘头的一切证据。然后是她所住教区的牧师同执事的证明书，证明她已经埋葬，还载明了她死的状况。验尸官请陪审官去判她这个案子的报告书副本以及陪审官的判决，他们断定，她是神经错乱。这些的确使我很满意，可是如果他了解一切情形，他就知道我并不是如此谨慎，甚至没有这些文件，我也会嫁给他。然而，我还是把这些文件全看了。我告诉他这的确很清楚，但是他用不着把这些东西全带来，因为还早得很。啊，他说，对于我也许还早，但是对他说来，就连现在都觉得太迟了。

另外还有几捆卷起来的纸，我问他那是什么。“哎呀，”他说，“我正盼你问我呢。”他说着打开那卷纸，取出一个鲛皮小匣子，从里面拿出一枚非常夺目的钻石戒指给我。这时我想拒绝也办不到了，因为他已经把它戴在我手指上。我只好向他行个礼，接受了这份礼物。然后他又拿出一枚戒指，说：“这是预备另外一次用的。”说着把它放在衣袋里了。

“但是也让我看一下吧。”我微笑着说，“我猜出那是做什么用的，我想你疯了。”

“假使我不这样做，才算疯了呢。”他还是不给我看，我又非常想看，我就说，“也让我看一下吧。”

“等一等，”他说，“先看这个。”于是他又拿起一卷纸，读起来。原来那是一张我们结婚的许可证明书。

“哎呀！”我说，“你发疯了吗？你准知道，你一开口，我就一定答应你，绝对不会拒绝吗？”

“那是一定的。”他说。

“你也许想错了。”我说。

“不，不，”他说，“我绝不会受拒绝，我不能受拒绝。”说着他就热烈地吻我，弄得我不能脱身。

房里有一张床，我们来回地走着，谈得正起劲。最后他突然双手抱住我，把我摔到床上，他自己也跟我一起倒下，紧紧地抱着我，但是一点轻薄的举动也没有，只是一再地恳求我答应嫁给他，说他怎样爱我，假使我不答应他，他绝不肯让我走。这弄得我没法，最后不得不说：“那么，我想你是决心不受拒绝了？”

“不，不，”他说，“我不会受拒绝，我不肯受拒绝，我不能受拒绝。”

“好吧，好吧，”我说，轻轻地吻了他一下，“那么你就不受拒绝吧，”我说，“让我起来。”

他得到我的同意，看到我答应时仁义的态度，高兴得心荡神驰。我立刻想到他或许以为我既答应了和他结婚，就不会拘于形式。但是我却冤枉他了，因为他只拉着我的手，把我扶起来，然后吻了我两三下，谢谢我答应他的好意。他心中充满了满意和欢欣的情绪，我看见他眼眶里全是眼泪。

我转过脸来，不去看他，因为我眼睛里也满是泪水了，于是我请他让我回房间里休息一会儿。假使我对过去二十四年的罪恶生活果有丝毫追悔的话，那就是这个时候。唉，我心里想，人们不能看透彼此的心，那对于人类，对于我自己是多么大的幸福啊！假使我一开始就嫁给这么一个诚实多情的人，该多好啊！

然后我忽然想到：“我是多么罪恶的一个人啊！我将怎样地欺骗这位老实的先生！他真想不到，与一个荡妇离了婚，又投入另一个荡妇的怀中！他将娶一个跟两兄弟睡过觉，和她自己的兄弟又生过三个孩子的女人！一个在新门监狱里出生，她的母亲曾是淫妇，现在又是流徙他方的窃贼的女人！一个同十三个男人睡过觉，自从他认识我之后又生过一个小孩的女人！可怜的先生！”我对自己说：“他将怎么办啊！”我这样自责之后，又想到：“不过，假使上帝肯给我恩惠，我做了他的妻子，我一定做个忠实的妻子，报答他对我那种异乎寻常的爱情。我将用实际行动来补偿我对他暗中的欺骗和侮辱。”

他急着等我从房里出来，但是看我许久还待在里面，便走下楼去，和旅馆主人谈关于牧师的事。

旅馆主人是个好事的人，但是心眼很好。他早已叫人去请牧师了，所以我那位先生和他谈到请牧师时，他就说：“先生，我的朋友已经在屋里了。”于是不用再说什么话就把他们两人带到一块儿了。当他走到牧师面前的时候，他问他肯不肯冒险替一对他不认识，而彼此愿意的人证婚。那牧师说，他的朋友已经向他提过了，他希望这不是一件偷偷摸摸的事情。他说我的这位先生好像是个正人君子，他想太太大概也不是个未嫁过的姑娘，所以还需要征求朋友们的同意。“为了不使你猜疑，”我那位先生说，“请看看这张纸。”说着他就拿出那张结婚准许证。“这我就放心了，”牧师说，“那位太大在哪里呢？”

“你立刻会看到她的。”我这位先生说。

他说完这话，就跑到楼上来，那时我已经走出房间。于是他告诉我牧师在下面，把结婚准许证给他看了之后，他很愿意替我们证婚。“但是他说要看看你。”他问我肯不肯让他上来。

“时间还早呢！”我说，“不是明天早晨吗？”

“我亲爱的，”他说，“他好像疑心你是不是个从父母那里偷跑出来的小姑娘，我告诉他我们两个都到了年纪，可以自己做主，所以他要看看你。”

“好吧，”我说，“随你的便。”于是他们就把这位牧师带上来了。他是个嘻嘻哈哈，心地很好的人。他好像听人说过我们偶然在这儿遇到，我是坐契斯特公共马车来的，我这位先生是坐他自己的马车来接我的。我们本来定于昨天晚上在司脱拉福相会，但是他没有赶到那里。“哈哈，先生，”牧师说，“每件不如意的事情里总会有点好处的。”他对我那位先生说，“失望是你的，好处却让我得到了，因为假使你们在司脱拉福遇到，我就没有替你们证婚的荣幸了。旅馆主人，你有祈祷书吗？”

我好像受惊了似的跳起来。“啊，先生，”我说，“你这是什么意思？难道在旅馆里结婚，而且还在晚上吗？”

“太太，”牧师说道，“假使你要在教堂里结婚也可以，但是我可以向你担保在这里结婚也同在教堂里一样有效。并没有教规规定我们一定要在教堂里结婚。至于在什么时候结婚，那是毫无关系的，我们的王子就是在夜里八点或者十点钟，在他们房里结婚的。”

我故意装出除非在教堂里，否则就不愿结婚的样子，过了许久，我才肯听他的话。自然，这是一副假面具。最后我好像是被他说服了。旅馆主人，他的妻子和女儿也都被叫了上来，旅馆主人当证婚人兼书记，这样我们就结婚了。我们都非常高兴。虽然我得承认从前压在心头的自责之言还是牢牢地记在心中，使我时时发出一声长叹，我的新郎看到了，尽力来鼓励我。他这个可怜的人，以为我这么匆忙地做了这件事而有些犹疑呢。

那天晚上我们尽量地享乐，可是在那旅馆里一切做得那么秘密，竟没有一个仆人知道这回事，因为旅馆女主人和她的女儿亲自伺候我，不让一个女仆上来。旅馆女主人的女儿我称她做我的新伴娘。第二天早上我叫了一个商店的伙计来，买了一套当地最好的镶花边的衣服送给这位姑娘。我发现这是个出产花边的城市，又买了一块里面有骨头的花边送给她母亲做帽子用。

旅馆主人所以这样保守秘密的原因之一是，他不愿本地教区的牧师听到这件事。但是尽管这样秘密，还是有人听到了这个消息，所以第二天清早礼拜堂的钟就为我们鸣了，那个城里的乐队还在我们窗下演奏起来。但是旅馆主人厚着脸皮说，我们没到这里之前就已经结婚了，因为我们是他从前的主顾，所以愿意在他家里吃喜酒。

第二天我们真不想起床，因为，早上被这些钟声搅扰了，也许起先本来没睡足，我们后来竟昏昏沉沉地躺在床上，差不多一直到十二点钟。

我求旅馆女主人设法使我们不再听到城里的乐队和礼拜堂的钟声。她处理得很好，我们享受到全然的安静。但是一件古怪的事使我非常震惊。那旅馆的大房子是朝着大街的，我走向大房子的一端，那天是个晴朗温和的日子，我打开窗子，站在旁边，呼吸新鲜空气。我看见三位先生骑着马从远处来，走进对面的一家客栈里去。

那是无可隐讳的，也是无可置疑的，这三人中的第二个就是我在兰开夏时的丈夫。我吓得要死，我生平从来没有这样害怕过，我以为我会晕倒在地上。血液在我的血管里变得冰冷，我发抖，好像患了疟疾，正在发冷。然而那却是千真万确的，我认出他的衣服，他的马和他的面孔。

我首先想到的是，我丈夫没有在我旁边看到我失神的样子。因此我觉得很高兴。那几位先生进去不久，就走到他们房间的窗边，但是你们可以想到，我的窗子自然是关起来的。然而，我却忍不住去偷看他，因此我又看见他了，听到他向那里的一个伙计要东西。我得到了一切可怕的证据，证明这个人的确是他。

其次我想知道的是，他到这里来做什么，但是这却无法办到。有时我的想象竟形成了各种可怕的幻影，有时我以为他发现了我的事情，特地来责备我的无情和无耻。我时刻以为他走上楼梯来侮辱我了。许多的念头一齐涌到我的心头，其实他未这样想过，也绝不会这样想的，除非魔鬼教唆了他。几乎一连两个钟头，我处在惊恐状态之中，我的眼睛一直望着他们所住的那家旅馆的门和窗。最后，我听到他们旅馆里走廊上一阵嘈杂声，我跑到窗口，使我非常高兴的是，看见他们三个都走出旅馆，往西走去。假使他们朝伦敦的方向走去，我还是会害怕的，唯恐我在路上会碰到他，他会认出我来。但是他却往相反的方向走去，于是我就放心了。

我们决定在第二天走，但是夜里六点钟左右我们听到街上一阵骚动，不觉大吃一惊。人们在街上骑着马乱跑，好像疯了似的。其实他们只是大声喊着追逐三个强盗，他们在但斯铁不尔山附近抢了两辆公共马车和一些其他的旅客。好像有个布告贴出来说有人看见他们在布立克喜尔某某旅馆里，就是指的那几位先生们住过的那家旅馆。

那家旅馆立刻被包围了，搜查了一遍，但是有不少人证明那些先生已经走了三个钟头了。群众既聚在一起，我们很快就打听出这个消息。现在我又为另一件事担心了。我立即告诉那家旅馆的人，我担保这几位先生不是强盗，因为我知道其中的一位是个非常正直的人，在兰开夏有很大一份地产。

人们把这话告诉追强盗的人们和来的那个警官，他立刻来到我面前，要我亲口再说一遍。我告诉他，当我站在窗口的时候，我看见了这三位先生。我后来看见他们站在他们吃饭的房子的窗口，然后我又看见他们上马。我可以向他担保，我认得其中的一位是个拥有很大地产的绅士，在兰开夏地方，很有名望，因为我是刚打那儿来的。

我说这些话时那种肯定的神气竟止住了那群民众，而那位警官也相信了。他立刻下令撤退，告诉同来的人那几个人不是强盗，却听人说他们是非常正直的绅士，于是他们就都回去了。这件事的真相我是不知道的，但是两辆公共马车的确在但斯铁不尔山被抢了，一共劫去了五百六十镑现金。此外老在那条路上走的几个贩卖花边的商人也被光顾了。至于那三位先生究竟如何，留在后面再讲。

这次惊慌使我们又多待了一天，虽然我的丈夫对我说一件盗案发生之后立即旅行总是最安全的。因为强盗惊动了那一带的人们之后，必定都远走高飞了。但是我却很担心，主要是怕我那位老朋友还在路上，说不定会遇到我。

我一生中没有过过比这四天更快乐的日子。在这四天里我完全是个新娘，我的新丈夫尽量使我处处如意。唉，这样的生活能够继续下去该多好啊！我过去的烦恼若能忘记，将来的悲哀若能避免该多好啊！但是我过去的生活太卑鄙龌龊了，种下了此生和来生的种种恶果。

第五天我们出发了。旅馆主人看出我不放心的样子，事先没有告诉我们，就和他的儿子，还有三个老实的乡下人带了武器，跟着马车走，一定要送我们到但斯铁不尔。我们只好在但斯铁不尔好好地款待了他们一番，这使我丈夫花了差不多十先令或者十二先令。他还给了他们一些钱，因为他们费了这么多时间，但是旅馆主人自己一点也没要。

这样做真是对我太有利了，因为假使我还未结婚就到伦敦来，第一天晚上我或许就要到他家里来，让他招待，要不就得向他说穿，在整个伦敦城里没有一个朋友能够招待我这个可怜的新娘同她的丈夫。但是现在，我却毫不犹豫地同他一直走到家里去，在那里我立刻拥有一所布置讲究的房子和一个很有钱的丈夫，所以假使我知道怎样安排的话，我一定会过着美满的生活。此外我还有闲暇去细想我将来那种生活的真正价值。这和我从前那种放荡不羁的生活是多么不同啊！这种清白善良的生活比我们所谓的愉快生活是更快乐得多了。

唉，假使我这样的生活能够继续下去，或者从我享受这种生活的时候起，就尝出此中的真乐，再没有堕入万恶之源的贫穷中去，我将多么快乐呀！不仅是此时，或许永远是快乐的。当我过着这样生活的时候，我对于过去的一切的确感到深深的忏悔。我厌恶地回想起从前的生活，真可以说我恨我自己。我常常想起，我在巴斯时的那位爱人，虽然爱我到极点，但是受了上帝的警戒，立刻就忏悔了，离开了我，再也不肯和我相见。然而最可怕的魔鬼——贫穷却鼓动了我，使我回头又去做坏事，借着所谓的一副漂亮面孔来救济我自己的穷困，这样美貌反变为罪恶之媒了。

我过去那种狂风巨浪般的人生航行结束之后，现在好像在一个安全的海港登陆了。我开始感谢上帝使我得救。我常常独自坐着，回忆起我过去的糊涂行为和罪恶生涯中的种种可怕的放荡行迹，就不禁流下泪来，有时我以为自己已经诚心悔悟了，还觉得很得意。

但是有些引诱不是人性所能抵抗的，假使有人被迫到了同样的境地很少人知道应当怎样去办。贪婪既是万恶之源，所以贫穷也是最坏的陷阱。但是我把这话暂时放下不提，等我说到一个实例的时候再说吧。

我和这个丈夫过着极端安静的生活。他是个恬静、明理、端庄的人。他很有道德，对人谦虚诚恳，他经营本行的业务也很勤勉正直。他的营业是很规矩的，他的收入却也足够维持充裕的一般生活。我不是说有一套车马仆从，或者像世人所谓的出出风头，我并没有期望或者要求这些。因为我既然厌恶以前的轻浮放荡的生活，那么现在就爱过幽静节俭和深居简出的生活。我没有什么应酬，也不去拜访人家，只是操持家事，使我丈夫快乐。这种生活对我真是一件乐事。

我们一连过了五年安闲满意的生活，忽然不知从什么地方来了一个打击，破坏了我一切的幸福，使我回到茫茫的世界里去。我所处的环境和从前恰恰相反了。

我丈夫把一笔钱交给他的一个同事去经营，那钱数目太大了，我们实在经不起这损失。因此这个同事失败之后，这个损失给我丈夫的打击很重，但是假使他有勇气大胆地去应付这种不幸，这个打击也不算很大。因为我曾经对他说他的信用既然这么好，就不难恢复他本来的财产。而遇到困难就意志消沉下去那就等于增加两倍的困难，自愿死在困难里面的人是必定会死在里头的。

用这些话来安慰他是无用的，这创伤实在太深了，是致命的。他整天忧郁悲伤，后来患了昏睡病，死去了。我早已料到这个结果，心里极端愁闷，因为我很明白假使他死去，我就完了。

我和他生了两个孩子之后就不再生了，因为，我已经四十八岁，已经到了停止生产的时期。我想即使他活下去，我也不会再生孩子了。

我现在真是处在一种凄惨可悲的环境里，在好几方面比以前任何时候都不如了。我的青春已经过去，以往我还可以指望做人家的姘头，现在我的美貌已经衰颓了，只留下以往的残迹。最糟的是我是世界上最沮丧的、最忧郁的人。我曾经劝过我丈夫，当他在困难之中我曾极力鼓励过他的勇气，但现在却不能鼓励我自己了。我在困难的时候正缺乏我告诉他忍受艰难时所必需的那种勇气。

我的情况的确是可怜的，因为我没有一个朋友，得不到一点帮助，我丈夫由于受到这次损失已经穷到这种地步，即使我还没有欠债，然而我却很容易地看出剩下来的钱是不能维持多久的。这笔钱一天天地花去，很快就会花光了，那时除了极端的困苦之外，我看不见别的前途。这种未来的幻景清清楚楚地呈现在我的眼前，好像已经来临了，虽然实际上这个可怕的结局还没有真的来临。同时我的恐惧又加深了我的痛苦，因为我觉得我每买一块面包所花的六便士都是我在世界上唯一的财产，明天我就要没饭吃，饿死了。

在这种困难的处境里，没有人帮助我，没有朋友来安慰我，替我打算。我不分昼夜地扭着自己的手坐着，哭着，为自己悲伤，有时竟像疯子似的胡说一阵。我后来的确常常纳闷，竟没有弄到神经错乱的地步，因为那时我忧郁到极点，有时我的理智完全陷入到幻想里去了。

在这种悲惨的环境里我过了两年，消耗着我仅有的一点点钱，不断地为我这凄凉的处境哭泣。我没有希望得到任何帮助，只能像流血，一直流到生命的消亡。我老是这样哭，哭了这么久。可以说眼泪已经哭干了，于是开始感到绝望，因为我很快地就穷了。

为了减少些费用，我退了我的房子，搬到公寓里去住。我既然要过更艰苦的生活，就卖掉我大部分的东西，于是我袋里又有了一点钱。我就靠着这点钱，克勤克俭，七拼八凑地又过了几乎一年。但是当我向前看，看到困苦贫穷的日子终于不免来临的时候，我的心就冷了。唉，谁读到我这段历史时，请他们千万好好地想一想处在孤苦伶仃的环境里的人们是什么情形，他们将怎样和饥饿无助的环境搏斗。这不但会叫读者想起节省自己的钱，还会叫他们想起向天求援和智者那句祈祷的话：“别给我以贫穷，怕的是我会去偷东西。”

请他们记住，窘迫的时候就是受到可怕的引诱的时候，一切抵抗的力量全消失了。贫穷逼到眼前，灵魂受到苦痛的折磨，又有什么办法呢？一天晚上，我真可以说是奄奄待毙了，我神志昏迷，说着谵语，忽然被不知什么精灵所鼓舞，好像干了一件我自己也莫名其妙的事。我打扮好（那时我还有很多漂亮的衣服），走出去了。当我走出去的时候，我确信我脑子里没有任何计划。我既不知道，也没有考虑到哪里去，或者干什么去。但是魔鬼既带我出去，放下他的鱼饵等我去拿，当然是他带我到那个地方去的，因为我不知道该到什么地方去和该干什么事情。

我这样走来走去，也不知道走到哪里，我走过立顿贺尔街上的一家药铺，看见柜台前的一个小凳上放着一个白布包着的小包。后面站着一个女仆，背朝着这小包，往店里的高处看。那里有一个人，我想大概是药铺的学徒，脚踏着柜台，背也朝门，手里拿着一根蜡烛，向上层的架子瞧着，伸手去取东西。所以两人都在专心注意自己的事情，店里没有别人。

这是魔鬼用的鱼饵。魔鬼既为我设好了陷阱，就很迅速地唆使我去干，因为我记得，而且永远不会忘记他好像从身后对我说：“拿走这个包，快点，立刻去拿。”一听这话，我就走进店去，背向着这个姑娘，好像我站在那里等一辆车从那里过去似的。我把手放在背后，拿了这个小包，带着走出去，那姑娘和那伙计没有看见我，谁也没有看见我。

做这事的时候，我灵魂的恐怖是不能用言语形容的。当我走开时，我无心逃跑，几乎也没有走快一点的勇气。我穿过街心，走进第一个小巷，我想那是一条通到范初克街的小巷。此后我又穿过许多的大街和小巷，我不知道那是什么地方，也不知道我向哪里走。我感觉不到脚下所踏的地，离危险的所在越远，我走得越快，直等到疲倦得喘不过气来，我才坐在一家门口外的一个小凳上，那时我开始清醒了，看出我是走进比林斯格特附近的泰晤士街。我歇了一下，又往前走，我的血全燃着了，我的心跳动着，好像忽然受了惊似的。总之，我是处在这样的惊恐之中，不知道我是往哪里走，或者应该怎么做。

这样紧张地走了一大段路，我感到疲倦极了，于是开始思量，向我的公寓走去，在夜里九点钟左右我回到了公寓。

这个小包是做什么用的，因为什么放在我所看见的地方，我是不知道的，但是我一打开，就发现里面有一套小孩的衣服。材料很好，几乎是新的，上面镶的花边非常美丽。一个有一品脱大的银碗，一只有耳的小银杯和六个调羹，此外还有一些别的衣料和一件很好的内衣，三条丝手巾。在那带耳的银杯里有张纸，那是十八先令六便士的现钞。

我打开这些东西的时候，明知不会有人知道，我却感到非常恐惧，简直无法形容。我坐下来，非常激动地哭起来。“上帝啊，”我说，“我现在成了什么人了？小偷！哎呀，下次我就要被抓去，送到新门监狱，受到死刑的判决啦！”想到这里．我又哭了许久，我敢说，虽然我是那么穷，假使我胆大的话，能战胜恐惧，我一定把东西送回原来的地方。但是过了一会儿，这种担心就过去了。那天晚上我虽然睡了觉，但是睡得很少。这件事情的恐怖压在我心上，我不知道一整夜和第二天一整天我说了些什么，干了些什么。此后我急着要知道一些关于失主的消息。想知道到底是怎么一回事，是穷人的东西呢，还是富人的东西。“也许，”我说，“这是像我这样一个穷寡妇的东西，她捆起这些东西拿去卖，想换一点面包给她自己和她那可怜的孩子吃。他们因为失去了他们本来可以换到的一点钱，正在饿着伤心哩。”这个念头比其他一切更使我苦痛，折磨了我足有三四天的光景。

但是我的穷苦压倒了这一切的念头，我自己挨饿的前途，每天更可怕地出现在我眼前，渐渐硬化了我的心肠。我已经改过自新了，也曾（我是这样希望的）忏悔了我过去的种种罪恶。我过着一种清醒、规矩同恬静的生活已经几年了，现在贫困的环境又把我的身体同灵魂驱使到毁灭之门，想起这一切来，我感到特别伤心。有两三次，我跪下来，尽我的能力，向上帝求救。但是我只好承认，我对我的祈祷是不抱什么希望的。我不知道怎样办好。外面弥漫着恐惧，我心里全是黑暗。我想必定是我没有真诚地忏悔我过去的生涯，所以上天现在开始在我未死之前责罚我，我从前是多么罪恶，他现在就使我多么可怜。

假使我这样想下去，也许我会成为一个真正悔罪的人了。但是我心里有个毒恶的怂恿我的人，他不断地唆使我用最卑鄙的手段来救济我自己。所以一天晚上，他又用上次向我说“拿走这小包”时的那种邪恶手段，引诱我再出去，寻找些凑巧遇到的东西。

我现在白日里出去，自己也不知往哪里走，也不知道去找什么东西，直到魔鬼在我走的路上设下一个可怕的陷阱，那陷阱的可怕，还是我从来没见过的。一天经过亚尔德斯盖特街时，我看见一个美丽的孩子，她在一个跳舞学校里上学，正独自走回家去。我的鼓舞者，像个真正的魔鬼，教我去骗这个天真烂漫的小孩。我和她谈天，她也向我说了许多话，我拉着她的手，和她一起走，等我走到一条通巴塞罗缪围场的铺砖的小巷，我就引她到巷里去。那小孩说这不是她回家的路。我说：“是的，我亲爱的，我要指给你看怎样回家。”那小孩带着金珠穿的一条小项圈，我已经看中了，在巷里的黑暗之中，我弯下身来，假装系好小孩的跳舞鞋上松了的带子，顺手摘下她的项圈。小孩既没有发觉，我于是又带她往前走。那时魔鬼教我在黑暗的巷里杀死小孩，那么她就不会啼哭了。但是单单这个念头就把我吓住，我几乎站不住脚了。我拉这小孩转过身来，吩咐她再回到先前走的路上去，因为这不是她回家的路。小孩说她会那样走的，我就走进巴塞罗缪围场，然后转到通向巷子的一条路上。走进查土荷斯广场，出来走到圣约翰街。然后，穿过斯密士飞鲁，走下七克巷，经过飞鲁巷，直抵荷奴倍恩桥，那时跟常走过那里的一大群人混在一起，就不会被发现了。这样我第二次冲进世界里来。

想起这个赃物使我忘却了以前的种种反省，我从前的自责很快就消失了。贫困硬化了我的心肠，我自己的困苦使我不顾一切了。最近这件事没有带给我很大的忧虑，因为我既没有加害于这个可怜的小孩，却感到给了她的父母一个应得的教训。他们这样疏忽，让这可怜的小羊独自回家，以后对于孩子要格外当心才是。

这串金珠值十二到十四金镑。我猜这或许是她母亲从前的东西，因为给小孩戴着太大了。也许是由于母亲的虚荣心，要她在跳舞学校里显得漂亮，故意让她戴这东西。无疑地，这个小孩一定有个女仆跟她同来，但是这个糊涂的轻狂女人，也许在路上碰到熟人聊起来了，于是这个小孩东飘西荡，一直落到我的手里。

然而，我并未加害于这个孩子，我连吓她一下都没有。因为我心肠还是很仁慈的，除了穷困逼迫着我做的事情之外，未曾做别的坏事。

此后我又有许多次的冒险，但是我干这事的经历很浅，不知道怎么办，只靠着魔鬼替我出主意，他的确常常鼓舞着我。有一次冒险，我是很幸运的。在一天傍晚暮色苍茫的时候，我走过郎巴德街，刚到三王场街口，忽然有一个人从我身旁闪电似的飞跑过去，扔下他手上拿着的一包东西，刚好落到我的背后。那时我正站在小巷转弯处一间屋子的角上。他一扔下就说道：“愿上帝保佑你！太太，让它在那儿放一放。”说完，他就像阵风似的跑了。跟着来了两个人，立刻又有一个未戴帽子的年轻人跑过，喊着：“捉贼！”他后面又有两三个人。他们紧紧地追着刚刚跑过的那两个贼。他们被迫丢下所得的东西，其中一个被捉住了，另一个却跑掉了。

这时候，我一直呆立在那里，等他们拖着那个可怜的贼，拉着他们找到的东西回来。他们既拿回了赃物又捉住了贼，我就放心了。他们这样从我面前走过，因为当这群人走过的时候，我只像个站在旁边看热闹的人。

有一两次我探问这是怎么回事，但是没人回答我，我也不想再问。等这群人完全走过之后，我就利用这个机会，转过身来，拿起我背后的东西，走开了。我干这个的确比前几次态度从容得多，因为这些东西不是我去偷的，却是别人偷来送到我手里的。我平安地把这些东西带回公寓，那是一块上好的黑色绢丝和一块天鹅绒。第二块只是一个零料，大约有十一码左右。第一块是五十码左右的整块料子。这好像是一家绸缎店被他们抢了。我说抢，是因为他们所损失的东西那么多，而他们后来拿回去的东西也那么多，我相信大约有六七块各样的绸缎料子。这些贼怎样能够得到这么多东西，我无法知道。但是既然我只是偷强盗的东西，我就毫不犹豫地拿走了，而且心里还很高兴。

截至那时为止，我的运气总算不坏，我又有几次冒险，虽然所得不多，可是都很成功，但是我天天害怕大祸会临到我的头上，我最后一定会被绞死。这种思想给我的印象太深了，竟使我有时不敢出手，虽然就情形而论，是很可以平安地去干的。但是有一件事我不能漏掉，那是一个我羡慕已久的鱼饵。我常常走到城市四围的乡村里，去看看有没有凑巧可以扒取的东西。走过斯帖卑来村附近的一间屋子时，我看见窗台上有两枚戒指，一枚是小的钻石戒指，一枚是普通金戒指。那一定是一位不细心的，有钱而缺乏先见的太太放在那里，或者只是等她洗完手就拿走的。

我沿着窗子走了几遍，仔细观察里面有没有人，我看不见有什么人，但是我还不放心。我忽然想起去敲玻璃，假装要对谁说话似的，假使里面有人，他一定会走到窗口，那么我就告诉他把这戒指拿走，因为我看见了两个可疑的人注意着这些东西。这是一种机智。我敲了一两下，没有人来，于是我就重重地敲了一下那个方块玻璃，没出多大声音就把它打破了，拿出这两枚戒指，走开了。那枚钻戒大约值三个金镑，其他一枚大约值九先令。

我现在完全不知道上哪里去卖这些赃物，尤其是我那两块丝料。我极不愿意得到一点点钱，就把它们让给别人，像可怜的、不幸的小偷通常所干的那样。他们拿性命去冒险，得来一件也许真正贵重的东西，却愿意廉价卖出。我却决定不这样干，不管我怎样设法去过日子。然而，我不大知道走哪条路好，最后我决定去找我的老保姆，再去同她结交。当我有可能的时候，我总是按期为我的孩子每年交给她五个金镑的，但是最后我被迫停止了。可是，我还是给她写了一封信，告诉她我的环境坏了，我死了丈夫，我再不能出这笔钱了，所以求她设法不要让这孩子因为母亲的不幸而过于吃苦。

我现在去看她，发现她仍然经营旧业，但是她的环境不如从前那么兴旺了。因为她被一位绅士所控告，他的女孩跟别人偷跑了，好像是她帮的忙，她险些没有上绞刑架。打官司的费用也几乎使她破了产，所以她家里的陈设也简陋了，她营业的声名也不像从前那么好了。然而，她还是站得住脚，她既是一个善于奔走的女人，还有些积蓄剩下，就开了一个当铺，所以生活还过得去。

她很客气地接待我，还像她往常那样殷勤地告诉我，她不会因为我穷了，就看不起我。虽然我不能替小孩出钱，她也尽量设法不让他吃苦，而且照顾他的那个女人环境还不坏，所以我用不着替他担心，等我将来有能力时再好好地帮助他吧。

我告诉她我没有剩下多少钱，但是我有些值钱的东西，希望她能够告诉我怎样可以把这些东西换成现钱。她问我是什么东西。我掏出那串金珠，对她说这是我丈夫送我的一件礼物。然后我给她看那两包丝料，对她说这是我从爱尔兰带到伦敦来的。还给她看那枚钻戒。至于那一小包银器同调羹，我早已自己想法卖掉了。而那些小孩的衣服，她愿意自己买去，因为相信这是我自己的。她告诉我她已经变作一个开当铺的人了，她会替我把这几件东西卖出去，说是人家当在她那里的。这东西到了她手里，她就立刻去叫人来把这些东西买去，既无人怀疑，出的价钱也高。

这时我开始想这个有用的女人，在我这样贫困的时候，或许能够帮我一点忙，找些正当事情干，因为只要可能的话我真愿找些正当的事情干。但是关于这点她是无能为力的。假使我年轻些，她也许能够替我找一个风流男人，但是我已经不想那种生活了，我已是五十多岁的人，这的确是我的情形，我就这样告诉她。

她最后请我来，住在她家里，等我能够找到什么事情干再说。这既然不要我花很多钱，我当然很高兴。现在生活比较宽裕些，我向她谈起要把同最后一个丈夫所生的儿子从我手上托出去。这她也办成了，说好每年只付五个金镑，假使我能够出的话。这对于我是个很大的帮助，有许久时间我没有干我新近所学的坏勾当。我很希望我能靠我的两只手过活，但是这对于一个在世界上没有熟人的人也是不容易做到的。

然而，最后我找到一些工作，替太太们缝被褥、裙子这类的东西。我非常喜欢这个工作，工作得很勤恳，于是就靠这个过活了。但是那个不倦的魔鬼决定了我将继续做他的部下，不断地鼓动我出去走一走，那就是说，看看有什么东西会像从前那样落到我的手里。

一天晚上我盲目地服从他的呼唤，去街上转了一个大圈子，但是碰不到机会，又累又饿地回到家里。但是白跑了这一趟又不甘心，于是第二天晚上我又出去。当我走过一家酒店时，我看见靠街的一间小屋子门开着，桌上放着一个大号的银酒杯，那是酒店里当时常用的东西。好像有一些人曾在那里喝过酒，不小心的伙计忘记把它拿走了。

我坦然地走进那小屋，把那大号银酒杯放在板凳的角上，我坐在它前面，用脚敲着地板，立刻有一个伙计走来。我叫他拿一品脱的热麦酒来，因为那时是冷天，伙计跑去了，我听见他走到地窖下面去盛麦酒。这伙计走了以后，另一个伙计走进屋子，问道：“您点餐吗？”我用一种忧愁的神气说道：“不。那个伙计已经给我拿麦酒去了。”

当我坐在那里的时候，我听到柜上的女人说：“五号的客人全走了没有？”

那就是我坐的屋子，伙计答道：“全走了。”

“谁把那大号银杯收起来的？”

“是我，”另一个伙计答道，“就是这个。”好像指着另一个银杯说，其实那是他弄错了，是从别的房间拿来的，不然就是这家伙忘记了他没有收进去，他的确没有收进去。

我听了这些话，心里很得意，因为我分明看出他们没发觉少了一个银杯，却以为已经收起来了。于是我喝完麦酒，叫他算账，临走的时候，我说：“当心你的银器，伙计。”意思是指他用来给我盛酒的那一品脱的小银壶。那伙计说道：“是的，太太，谢谢你的好意。”然后我就走开了。

我回到老保姆的家里，我想现在该试探她一下了，假使我一旦事情败露，她也可以帮我的忙。我回家一会儿之后，乘着和她谈天的机会，就对她说我有个世界上最大的秘密要告诉她，希望她对我有相当的诚意，肯替我保守。她对我说，她已经很忠实地替我保守了一个秘密了，为什么怀疑她不能保守另一个秘密呢？我对她说世上最奇怪的事临到我头上来了，甚至于我自己也毫无这种打算，接着我就告诉她关于那大号酒杯的一切经过。“你把它带来了没有，我亲爱的？”她说。

“我当然带来了。”说着我就拿出给她看。“可是现在我怎么办呢，”我说，“我要不要送回去？”

“送回去？”她说，“你想去新门监狱的话！”

“怎么，”我说，“我要把它送回去，他们绝不至于那么卑鄙，把我拘留起来吧？”

“你不知道这种人，孩子，”她说，“他们不仅要把你送到新门监狱，而且要绞死你，不管你多么诚实。他们甚至会开出历来丢失的银杯，一起要你赔偿。”

“那么，我该怎么办呢？”我说。

“不，”她说，“你既已干了这勾当，偷了银杯，你就得留起来，现在再也无法送回去了。而且，孩子，”她说，“你不是比他们更需要这东西吗？我希望你每星期都能碰到一回这样的生意。”

这使我对于我的保姆有了一个新的了解，她既已变成了一个开当铺的人，她身边就另外有了一帮人，那不是我从前在她那里遇到的那些老实人。

我在那里没住多久，就比以前更明显地看出这点来了，因为我常常看到剑柄、银匙、银叉、银杯这一类的东西拿进来。不是来当，而是干脆卖给她。凡是拿来的东西，她什么话也不问，全都收下，但是很能赚钱，这些我是从她谈话里知道的。

我还看出她做这路生意时总是把她买来的银器熔化，免得让人看出来。一天早上，她告诉我，她要去熔银子，假使我愿意，可以把我的银杯也放进去，那么就不会被人看破了。我对她说，我很愿意。她于是称了一下，按重量算给我钱，一点也不少。但是我看她对于别的主顾却没有这么公道。

此后不久，当我正在工作，心情很烦闷的时候，她问我为什么这样。我对她说，我心里很忧郁，我没有多少工作，没有钱过活，不知道走哪条路好。她大笑着说，我必须再出去，试试运气，也许我会再碰到一件银器。“啊，妈妈！”我说，“这个行道我不熟练，假使我被抓去，我立刻就完了。”

她说：“我想给你找个老师，她能教得你跟她一样熟练。”

我听到这话，浑身发抖，因为我一向没有同党，同那伙人全不认得。但是她战胜了我的一切廉耻和恐惧，在很短的时间内，借着这位同党的帮助，我变成一个小偷，其厚颜和熟练，真不亚于女贼摩尔[3]，虽然——如果所传是真的——没有她一半的漂亮。

她介绍给我的这位同党有三样本领，就是：到店里偷东西；偷书店的书籍和小本的书；从太太们身上偷金表。最后这一样她干得非常熟练，的确没有一个女人能够做到她那样的程度。这三样本领之中，我最喜欢头一样和第三样，我有时跟着她一起去偷，真像一个学接生的跟着接生婆一样，没有得到任何的报酬。

最后她叫我亲自试验。她先指示我看她的技术，我有好几回很熟练地从她身旁摘下一只金表。最后她指给我一个目标，那是一位怀孕的年轻太太，她带着一只很好的表。这件事要在她走出教堂时才能做。她在这位太太一旁走着，当她刚一走上台阶时，就假装摔倒，猛烈地撞在这位太太身上，使她大吃一惊，两人都大叫起来。正当她撞着这位太太的时候，我就抓住这个表，抓得很合适，她猛然一跳，表上的钩就松下来，而她自己却一点也不知道。我立刻逃跑，留下我的老师，让她渐渐从她的假惊慌里恢复过来，那位太太也渐渐恢复了，然后才发现她的表被人偷去。“唉，”我的同党说道，“那么一定是把我撞倒的那些流氓干的，我敢向你担保。可惜这位太太没有早些发现，不然我们还可以抓住他们。”

她敷衍得这么好，谁也不怀疑她，而我却早到家一个钟头了。这是我第一次同人合伙冒险。那只表的确非常好，上面挂着许多小玩意儿，我的保姆用二十个金镑买了去，我得了一半。这样我就成了一个正式的小偷了，心肠残酷到不顾一切廉耻和良心的程度。这是我从前绝没有想到的。

魔鬼开头用不能抵抗的贫穷推动我干这种坏事，现在却把我带到超乎一般小偷的范围之外了，甚至于我的贫困不像从前那么可怕的时候，我还是想偷。因为我现在已经有了一些活干，我既然很会做针线，靠着正直的劳动来生活，是很可能的。

我必须说，假使我刚开始觉得我贫苦的境况就要来临的时候，这个希望就出现在我的面前——我说，假使靠着工作来生活的这个希望那时就出现在我的面前，我决不会堕落到这种罪恶生涯之中，或者和我现在搭伙的那些坏人为伍。但是习惯使我的心肠硬化了，我胆大到极点了。尤其是因为我干了这么久，从没有一次被人抓着。总之，我作恶的新伴侣和我一起干了这么久，而且没有被人们发现，我们不仅是胆大了，而且富裕起来了，有一回我们手里有二十一只金表。

我记得有一天我认真地想了一想，发现我手头攒了一大笔钱，差不多有二百镑现金是我的。一个念头很猛烈地涌上心来，那当然是仁爱的天神所启示的，那念头是，既然起先是贫穷逼迫着我，困苦驱赶着我去干这可怕的勾当，那么现在困苦减轻了，我又可以靠工作维持生活，而且还有那么多钱做后盾，现在为什么不乘着还没落网的时候放手呢？而且我也不能老是期望着可以幸免啊，假使我给人当场捉住，我可就完了。

这无疑是个难得的机会，如果那时我听了这天神的指示，不管这天神是谁，我还有个过安闲日子的机会。但是我的命运却注定不是这样。那个拉我走进罪恶之途的殷勤的魔鬼把我抓得太紧了，绝不让我回去。贫穷既把我带到这泥坑里，贪婪就把我留在里面了，弄得我最后无法回去。每当我的理智劝我放下的时候，贪婪就插进来，说：“干下去，干下去，你一向运气很好，干下去，等到你有四五百金镑的时候，你再放手，那时你就可以什么也不干，过舒服日子了。”

我一落到魔鬼的掌握里，就被他抓住了，好像被他的妖术迷住了心，没有力量走出那圈子，直到最后我陷入困难的迷宫中去，简直无法脱身。

然而，这些念头在我心上留下了一些印象，使我干那事时比以前更小心，也比我的导师们更小心。我的同伴（我这样叫她，其实该叫她老师）和她另一个学生是最早遇到不幸的。因为她们找生意的时候，向齐布赛一个布商试了试，但是被一个眼睛和鹰鸟一样锐利的工人瞧见了。他们把她们抓去，还从她们身上搜出来一块麻纱。

这就足够把她们送到新门监狱去了，在那里她们又不幸牵扯到旧罪。其他两件案子提出来，都说与她们有关，经证实后，她们就被判了死刑。她们两人都说自己有孕，请缓期执行，两人都被批准，其实我的女教师跟我一样，不可能有身孕。

我常去看她们，安慰她们，心想下次恐怕会轮到我了。但是那地方太让我恐怖了，想起那是我不幸的降生所在也是我母亲受难的地方，我简直不忍再去，因此就不去看她们了。

唉！假使我能够从她们的失败中得到教训，我还可以有快乐的日子，因为我还是个自由人，还没有什么罪名加到我身上来。但是我不能做到，因为我的苦难还没有受完。

我的同伴因为是个旧犯，被处死刑。那个年轻的罪人却得到宽赦，判了个暂缓处刑的罪名，但是在监狱里饿了不少日子。最后设法把她的名字也放到大赦名单里，这样她就出狱了。

我同伴的这个可怕的例子深深地把我吓住了，有很长时间我没去街上流荡。但是一天晚上，在我保姆家的附近，有人喊道：“着火了。”我们那时都起来了，我的保姆往外看了看，立刻喊道某太太家的屋顶全着了，我也看见的确是这样的。她那时用肘推了我一下。“孩子，”她说，“现在是个难得的机会，既是这么近的地方着火，在街口被群众塞住之前，你可以去一下。”她接着告诉我怎样去办。“孩子，”她说，“到那里去，告诉那位太太，或者你看到的任何人，你是来帮她们的，说你是某位太太（指那位太太的一个住在街那头的朋友）派来的。”

我跑去了，到了那里，看见她们乱成一团，这是你们可以想象的。我跑进去，碰到一个女仆，“天呀！我的乖乖，”我说，“这场祸怎么闹出来的呢？你的主人在哪里？她没有危险吗？孩子们在哪里？我是××太太派来帮忙的。”

“太太，太太，”那女仆跑去，尽量大声地嚷道，“这里有个人是××太太派来帮助我们的。”那个可怜的女人已经半疯了，怀里挟着一个小包，手上抱着两个小孩，向我走来。“天呀！太太，”我说，“让我把这两个可怜的孩子带到××太太那里去吧。她希望你把他们送去，她会照顾这两个可怜的小羊。”我立刻从她手里接过一个，她把另外一个也递到我怀里。“好，请你看上帝面上，”她说，“把他们送去吧。啊！替我谢谢她的好意。”

“你还有什么别的东西要保存起来吗？”我说，“她也可以替你保管。”

“啊，乖乖！有，”她说，“愿上帝保佑她，把这包器皿也交给她吧。啊，她是个好心的女人。啊，天呀！我们是全完了，倒霉透了！”然后她疯狂地跑开了，女仆跟在她后面，我就带着两个小孩和一个小包跑走了。

我一走到街上，就看见一个女人来到我面前。“啊！”她用一种怜悯的声调说道，“太太，你抱的小孩快摔下来了。来吧，这是个悲惨的时候，让我帮帮你吧。”她立刻抓着我的小包，要替我拿。“不，”我说，“假使你想帮助我，请拉着这小孩的手，只要领他到街上，就行了。然后我再跟你一道走，你的劳苦，我也将有相当的酬报。”

我说了这些话，她不得不跟我同走。总之，这家伙是个和我同行的人，她不要别的，只要那小包。然而她不得不跟我走到那家门口。当我们到了那里的时候，我向她低声说：“去吧，孩子，”我说，“我知道你是哪一行的人，你现在还可以去兜不少生意。”

她了解了我的意思，就走开了。我带着小孩打雷似的敲着门，那家的人既然早已被着火的消息惊醒，很快地就让我进去。我说：“太太醒着吗？请告诉她××太太恳求她收留这两个小孩。可怜的太太，她算是完了，她们家全着了。”她们很客气地收留了两个孩子，着实可怜那受难的家庭，我就带着小包走了。一个女仆问我要不要把那小包留在那里。我说：“不，亲爱的，那要拿到别的地方去，那不是她们的。”

我现在用不着匆忙了，于是往前走，把那包值钱的器皿一直带回家去，交给我的老保姆。她对我说她现在先不去瞧它，叫我再去兜些生意。

她给了我相似的线索，叫我到着火那家隔壁的太太那里，我就努力做去，但是这时火警的信号传布各处，那么多的水龙在那里营救，街上挤着这么多人，我无论怎样也不能走近那屋子。所以我又回到我的老保姆家里，将那小包拿到我的房里，检查了一遍。我现在说出我发现有多么贵重的东西时，还感到恐怖。我只用说，除了许多件家庭用的银器皿之外——那已经是很值钱了——我发现一条古式的金链，上面的小锁已经断了，所以我想它有好几年没用过了，但是那金子并不因此而减色。还有一小箱的古式戒指，一颗女人的结婚戒指，几块旧式金锁碎片，一只金表，一个钱袋，里面有几个差不多值二十四个金镑的古金币，此外还有几件值钱的东西。

这是我所得到的最多的也是最坏的赃物，因为虽然像我前面所说的，我现在对于其他窃案已经心硬得完全无动于衷了。但是当我瞧着这么多的宝物，想到那位可怜悲伤的太太时，心里感到无比的痛苦。她除了这些宝物之外已经损失不少了。她一定以为她的金银器皿和最值钱的东西都保留住了。当她发现她被骗了，发现带着她的小孩和她的东西走的人并不是邻街的太太派来的人，这两个小孩却是莫名其妙地被带到她家里，她将多么惊骇和痛心。

我说，我自认这种不人道的举动使我很痛心，我非常怜悯她，那时一想到这事，就流下泪来。但是我心里虽然深深觉得这是残忍和不人道的事，却绝不愿拿出什么来做赔偿。这种自责的心情渐渐地消失了，我开始很快地忘记得到这些东西时的一切情境。

不仅如此，因为虽然靠着这回生意我比从前富得多了，可是我以前下的决心，那就是说当我再得到些钱之后立刻脱离这可怕的生涯，却没有回到心上来。我却相反地要再得多些。贪婪的心情获得了如此的满足，我简直不想及时改变生活了，尽管不改变生活，我就不能希望得到安全，就不能稳稳地保着我所得来的东西，但是再挣一些吧，再挣一些吧，这老是我的想法。

最后，我受到罪恶的一再唆使，撇开了一切的忏悔，我的一切自责只归结到一个念头：我或许能够再得到一件赃物，最后完成我的心愿。我虽然的确得到了那赃物，可是每次的成功又引我再干下去，我受到这样的鼓舞，真不愿放手不干。

在这种情形下，成功硬化了我的心肠，我决意再往下干。因此坠入了我得到最后一次赃物时必然遇到的陷阱。但是这件事那时尚未发生，我还遇到过几次成功的冒险。

我的保姆有一个时期的确很为我那个上绞刑架的同伴伤心，因为我那个同伴知道很多我保姆的事情。说出来，也足以使她上绞刑架的。这使她非常不安，她的确感到很大的恐慌。

说真的，当她死了以后，并没有说出她所知道的秘密，我的保姆就放心了，也许还觉得高兴，因为她能够牺牲她的朋友，去得到赦免。但是，她的去世，和她没有泄露她的秘密这个盛情，却感动了我的保姆，使她真诚地为她哀悼。我尽力去安慰她，她却使我的心肠硬化到更该上绞刑架。

然而，像我上面所说的，这使我更加小心，我尤其不敢去偷货店，特别是绸缎商和布商的货店，他们都是眼光敏锐，到处留神的人。我曾经冒过一两次险，去偷那些卖花边的同卖女帽的人，特别是两个新做这种生意的年轻女子开的一家店，我记得我从那里拿走一块值六七金镑的花边和一包线。但是这只能干一次，这是一种可一不可再的把戏。

每当我们听说有一家新开的铺子，尤其是开店的不是学徒出身的时候，就认为是一件万无一失的生意。这些铺子一开张，我们总要光顾一两次，除非他们是非常精明的人，否则是无法防止的。

以后我又冒了一两次险，但都所得无几。有很长的时间我没有碰到大宗的生意，于是感到必须改行不干了，但是我的保姆不愿意失掉我，还希望我能够大大成功。一天她带我还有一个年轻女人和一个男人相会，那男人据说是那女人的丈夫，我后来却看出，她并不是他的妻子，而是生意上的伙伴和其他事件上的伴侣。总之，他们一同偷东西，一同睡觉，一同被捕，最后一同上了绞刑架。

我的保姆从中拉拢，我和这两人合起伙来了，他们带我去冒了三四次险，我却看到他们干了些又笨又蠢的勾当。他们所以能够成功只是靠着他们的大胆妄为和被窃人的过于粗心。所以我决定此后和他们一起去冒险的时候，必须格外小心。真的，有两三次他们提出不妥的计划时，我不肯加入，也劝他们不要去做。有一回，他们说要去一个钟表匠那里偷三只金表，他们在白天侦查过了，发现了放表的地方。他们中的一个有很多各式各样的钥匙，他认为打开这钟表匠放表的地方自然毫无问题。于是我们定好时间在某地会面。但是当我仔细问他们的时候，才知道他们打算打破那屋子的门，这是我从来不干的，因此他们就独自去了。他们用强闯进屋里去，打开了放表的地方，但是只看见一只金表和一只银表，他们拿去了，毫无阻碍地走出那屋子。但是那家人被惊醒了，就大喊：“捉贼。”那个男人被追上捉住了。那个年轻女人虽然跑走了，但是不幸得很，没跑多远就被人拦住，表就在她身上找了出来。这样我第二次又幸免了。他们定案之后，都被绞死了，因为他们是惯犯，虽然都是年轻人。我前面说过，他们一起偷东西，一起睡觉，所以现在他们也一起上绞刑架，我那新的合伙生意也在那时告终了。

我既然险些被人捉住，又亲眼看到了他们的榜样，就开始非常谨慎起来。但是我有一个新的唆使者，她天天鼓唆着我——那就是我的保姆。现在有一件赃物摆在面前，那既是她用心打听出来的，所以她希望分一大部分。她听说一家人家存着大批的弗兰德斯地方出产的花边，这种花边是违禁的东西，只要让海关人员知道，他们就做了一笔好买卖。我的保姆向我详细叙述了货的总额以及所藏的地方，我就去找到了一个海关人员，对他说我可以告诉他这么一个信息，如果他答应给我应得的报酬，我就会使他得到那些花边。这是个再公平不过的建议了，所以他赞成了，带着一个巡警和我去搜查那家人家。我对他说过我能够一直进到那里，他就让我去办。那个地窖很黑，我挤进去，手里拿了一支蜡烛，把花边一包一包地运出来，当我递出给他时，设法悄悄地藏在身上一些，能够藏多少就藏多少。我藏了将近三百金镑的花边，五十金镑左右的东西。那家人不是这花边的主人，是一个商人把这项货物托他们保管的，所以他们不像我所想象的那么惊慌。

那海关人员得了这项赃物，非常高兴。我离开他时，和他约好了相会的地方，我安置好了我藏在身上的货物以后，就到那里去，竟没有引起他丝毫的怀疑。当我见到他时，他同我磋商，以为我不知道有分享这项赃物的权利，很想出二十金镑就算了事。但是我告诉他我并不像他所想象的那样傻，可是我心里也很高兴，因为他肯这样老老实实地和我讲价钱。

我要一百金镑，他增到三十金镑。我落到八十金镑，他又加到四十金镑。总之，他出了五十金镑，我答应了，另外要了一块花边，大约值八九金镑，说是拿来自己穿的，他也答应了。当天晚上我让他付给我五十金镑的现金，这样就把这宗生意了结了。他既不知道我是谁，也不知道到哪里去打听，所以即使他发现一部分货被我偷走了，也无法找我理论。

我很公平地和我的保姆分了这份赃物，从此以后在她眼里我成了会办难事的能手。我发现我最近干的这件事是我这行里最实惠、最容易做的事。所以我就专门到处打听违禁的货物，我先去买一些，然后把卖货人陷害了，但是我每次告发他们总得不到很大的好处，绝不像我上次所得的那样可观。但是我却愿意做安稳的生意，慎重着干，不敢冒很大的险。我看别人大胆去干，却天天闯出祸来。

此后我干的值得一提的事是，有一回去偷一位太太的金表。我挤在一群人中，在一个会场门口，我真是几乎被捉住了。我把她的表链完全抓住了，当我重重地撞她一下，好像有人在后面把我向她推去的时候，我用力拉那只表，但是却拉不出来，于是就放了手，大声喊叫，好像我被人杀了似的。我说有人踩我的脚，这里一定有扒手，因为有个人拉我的表。你们要知道，干这类事的时候，我们总是打扮得很好，我身上穿的是很讲究的衣服，身上也挂着一只表，和贵夫人的样子不相上下。

我一喊，那位太太也跟着喊道：“有扒手。”因为她说有人要拉她的表。

当我拉她的表的时候，我紧靠着她，但是我喊的时候，我立刻停了手，那时人群推着她往前走，所以当她也喊出来的时候，已经和我隔得很远了，因此她一点也不疑心我。而且当她喊“有扒手”的时候，我身旁另一个人也喊道：“是的，这里也有一个！这位太太也被扒过了。”

就在这时候，恰巧在比较远的一群人里又有人喊道：“有扒手。”的确抓到了一个正在偷窃的年轻人。这对于这年轻人的确是很不幸的，对于我却是再好没有了，虽然起先我已经能够敷衍过去。但是现在什么问题都没有了，群众都向那边跑去，这个可怜的孩子就被拉到街上受人们的毒打，那种残忍是用不着我描述的。然而他们倒宁愿受毒打，而不愿被送到新门监狱去，到了那里他们会被关得很久，有时还免不了上绞刑架。假使他们被判了罪，他们最希望的，是流徙到外地去。

这对于我真是死里逃生，我怕极了，以后许久都不敢再去扒金表。在这次冒险中，的确有许多原因使我能够脱逃，但是最主要的原因是，那个被我拉了一下金表的女人是个傻瓜。就是说，她不懂得此中的意义，虽然看到她把表紧缚在身上，使它不至于被人扒去，人们会以为她必定很明了扒手的举动。但是她吓坏了，简直失去了捉拿扒手的机智。因为当她觉得有人拉她的表时，她就大喊起来，自己往前挤，弄得她身旁的人们乱成一团，至少有两分钟的光景，她完全没有提到她的表，或者有扒手，这就足够使我脱逃了。我既然像前面所说的站在她后面喊，当她往前面冲去时，我却往人群里退，人群又老是动着，所以一会儿我和她中间最少隔了七八个人，然后我才喊道：“有扒手。”喊得比她还早些，最少也是同时喊的，所以她也可以算个有嫌疑的人，人们当时糊里糊涂地问这个问那个。但是反过来说，假使她有应付这种事情的智慧，她一发觉有人拉她的表，就不该那样喊起来，而应立刻转过身，抓住紧挨她身后的人，那么她就一定会抓到我了。

这些话不是爱护同行者所该说的，但是这的确是洞悉扒手行动的妙诀，能够按这话做的人绝对抓得到小偷，不按这话做的人必定会丢失东西。

我另有一次冒险，很可证明前面的话，可作为后世做扒手的参考。提到我那慈爱的老保姆，让我谈一点她的历史吧。虽然她已经不干那生意了，我可以说她是天生的扒手。我后来才知道关于这项生意她是无所不干的，但是只有一次被人捉到了，那次她很明显地被人看破了，而被判了罪，受到流徙的处分，但是她是个极会讲话的女人，身边又有钱，当船停在爱尔兰购粮食的时候，她就设法逃上岸去，她住在那里，重操旧业有好几年。当她和另一帮坏人结交时，她又当了产婆和拉皮条的人，在那里还干了不少乱七八糟的事情，我们彼此更熟识的时候，她悄悄地告诉了我这段历史的大概。全靠着这个坏家伙，我才学会了这一切手段，在这方面，很少有人会比我高明，或者做了这么长时间而没有遇到什么不幸。

当她在爱尔兰弄出这许多把戏，在那里已经声名狼藉了，便离开都柏林，回到英国来。她流徙的期间既然还未结束，就不敢再做从前的生意，害怕又会被抓去，那样一来，她就算完了。在这里她重操在爱尔兰时的旧业，靠着她那优良的管理和很会说话的舌头，很快就达到我在前面所描写的盛况，的确有发财的趋向了，但是后来她的生意又衰落下去。

我在这里谈了这么多这个女人的历史，为的是能够更明白地说明她跟我现在所过的邪恶的生活有什么关系。她好像牵着我的手把我引到种种坏事情里。她给我这么好的指导，我这么敏捷地照她教我的去干，竟变成了当时最有本领的扒手了。我能够很巧妙地想法从每次危险中脱身，我有几位同伴才做了半年的生意，就都到新门监狱里去了，我现在已干了五年多，新门监狱里的人连认识我的机会都没有。他们的确常听到人们谈我这个人，常常期望我会到那里去，但是我老是漏网，虽然有许多次极大的危险。

我现在最大的危险，是我在同行里太出名了，有些小偷不是因为我损害了他们什么，倒是因为忌妒我老是脱逃，他们却老是被捉到新门监狱去，而开始感觉生气。就是他们这些人给我起了“荡妇弗兰德斯”这个绰号，这与我的真姓名和我所有丈夫的姓名全不相干，正如黑白不同一样，除了有一次躲避在贫民窟里的时候我自称弗兰德斯太太。但是这些流氓绝不知道，我也无法查出他们起先怎样替我起的这个名字，或者因为什么起的这个名字。

我的消息很灵通，立刻就得知有些没干多久就被抓进新门监狱去的人们要告发我。我知道里面有两三个人有充足证据可以攻击我，因此非常恐慌，老是不敢走出家门。但是我的保姆——我总是把赃物和她共享，她现在真是干着一件百无一失的生意，因为所得的东西她有份，然而所冒的危险她却无份——我说，我的保姆看我过着这种无用的，不挣钱的生活，有些不耐烦。她想出一个新的妙法，使我可以出去做生意，那就是让我穿上男人的衣服，这样我又去干一种新的玩意儿了。

我的身材很高，我的态度也很文雅，但是我的脸孔太光滑了，不像个男人。然而除了晚上我是不大出门的，所以也过得去。但是经过很长的时间，我穿着新衣服才能行动自如——我是说，做我本行生意的时候。穿着这么不自然的衣服，要想很敏捷，很灵活，很熟练地做那种事，是办不到的。我既然干什么事都是笨手笨脚的，也就不能像从前那么成功，那样容易脱逃了，于是决心不再干下去，不久刚好就发生了下面这件事，使我这决心更加坚定。

我的保姆既把我扮成一个男人，就叫一个男人跟我合伙。那是一个干这行很敏捷的年轻人，有三个星期的时间，我们合作得很好。我们主要的生意是店家的柜台，看见有什么东西不当心放在那里，偷了就跑。在这方面，我们做了几回所谓的好买卖。我们既然老是在一块儿，就渐渐很熟识了，可是他绝不知道我不是一个男人，虽然有好几次为了事情的方便，我跟他一同到他的住所，还有四五回整夜和他睡在一起。但是我们的目的是在别的方面，因此不让他看出我是女性，是绝对必要的，这在后面就可以看出了。我们这种生意，必须深夜回来，并且为了安全不能让任何人到我们的住所里来——所有这些情况都使我无法拒绝和他同睡，除非我承认是女性，可是那时的确把我的性别隐藏得很成功。但是他的不幸和我的侥幸不久就把这种生活结束了，说真的，我也的确厌倦这种生活了。我们在这种别开生面的生意里也得到过几回好处，但是最后一次是很大的。在某一条街上有一家店铺。这家店铺后面的货栈是朝着另一条街的，因此这个店铺刚好在拐角的地方。

从店铺的玻璃窗，我们看见窗子后面的柜台或者陈列柜上放着五块丝料，此外还有别的料子。虽然那时天快要黑了，可是伙计们还在店前忙着招呼主顾，没时间把这窗子关好，不然就是忘记关了。

那个年轻人看见了，高兴得不得了。他说这些他全能拿得到，并且对我狠狠地发誓说，即使非把整个屋子推倒不可，他也要拿到手。我稍稍劝了他一下，但是我看出我是无法阻止他的。于是他就不顾一切地去了，很老练地抽下一格窗框，取了四块丝料，向我走来，但是立刻有人追赶，带着可怕的嘈杂的声音。那时我们的确是站在一起的，但是我还没有从他手里接过任何货物，就急忙向他喊道：“你完了！”他闪电似的跑去，我也跑了，但是人们更紧地追着他，因为他带了赃物。他扔下两块料子，这使他们停了一会儿，但是群众渐渐增多了，跟着我们两人追来。他们不久就抓到他，拿回他身上的两块料子，然后其余的人们都来追我了。我拼命跑，一直跑到我保姆的家里，但是有几个眼光敏锐的人紧紧地追着我：他们看见我走到里面去了。他们并没有立刻去敲门，因此我有时间脱下我的假装，穿上我自己的衣服。而且，当他们来到门前时，我的保姆有一套随机应变的话，把门关住，大声同外面的人们说话，告诉他们并没有人进来。人们肯定地说有个人进来，还发誓说他们要打破大门。

我的保姆一点也不惊慌，冷静地同他们谈话，告诉他们，假使他们带着警察来，除了警察所许可的人以外，不许任何人进去，他们可以随便搜查她的屋子，因为让一大群人都到屋里来是不合理的。这个提议他们不能拒绝，虽然他们是一群乌合之众。于是立刻就来了一个警察，她就很随便地打开大门。警察守着门，他所指定的人们进去搜查屋子，我的保姆陪着他们走过一间一间的房子。当她走到我门前的时候，她就叫我，大声说道：“表妹，请开门，这里有几位先生一定要进来，看一看你的房间。”

我有一个小姑娘和我在一起，她是我保姆的孙女，她是这样叫她的。我就叫她去开门，我坐在里面工作，有一大堆乱七八糟的东西在我身旁，仿佛我整天都在工作着。我一点也没有打扮，头上只戴了一顶睡帽，身上穿了一件宽大的睡衣。我的保姆请我原谅他们的打扰，告诉我一些原因，还说她没有办法，只得打开门让他们进来，让他们随便搜查，因为她对他们说了许多话都不能使他们满意。我坐着不动，叫他们随便搜这间屋子，因为即使有人进来了，我敢说他也不是躲在我的房里。至于其他的屋子，我没有什么话可说，因为我根本就不知道他们要找什么。

我的神情显得那么坦然，那么诚实。他们觉得我出乎意料地客气，但是他们还是非常仔细地搜查了那间房子。他们甚至连床上，床下，以及一切可以藏东西的地方都搜遍了。他们搜完了，找不出什么来，向我道歉之后就走了。

他们这样把房间彻底搜查了一遍，没有搜出东西来之后，群众的情绪就沉下来了。但是他们却把我的保姆带去见法官。有两个人发誓说，他们看见他们所追的人跑了进去。我的保姆却说了许多话，说这对她家是很大的侮辱，她不能无缘无故地让人这样对待。假使真有个男人跑进去，也许立刻又跑出来了，那是说天定的，但是她可以发誓说，据她所知道的，整天没有一个男人走进她的大门（这的确是真的）。也许她在楼上的时候，有人被追得很急，在恐惧中看到那大门开着，的确跑进来躲一躲，但是她是一点也不知道的。假使真是这样，他一定又跑出去了，或者是从另一个门跑出去的，因为她另有一个门通到一条小巷里，这样他就逃跑了。

这些话的确很像是真的，审判官叫她发一个誓说，她没有收留任何男人，或者准许任何男人走进来，把他隐匿起来，或者保护他免受法律的责罚，也就满意了。她立刻发了个誓，就被释放了。

这一次我是怎样地害怕，那是可想而知的，此后无论我的保姆怎么说，我再也不敢扮作男人了。我告诉她，我恐怕自己败露了。

和我一起做这事的那个可怜的同伴现在却受苦了。他被带到“市长大人”面前，经他判定送到新门监狱。抓他的那些人肯卖力气去告发他，他们自愿在审判那天出庭，来证明他的罪行。

但是，他的判决却延期了，因为他答应找出他的一切同谋犯，尤其是这次窃案里和他有关系的那个男人。他的确努力去找，他把我的名字告诉他们，是叫加不立尔·斯宾塞尔，这是我对他所用的假名。这里就可以看出我向他隐起我的真名和性别的好处了，不然的话，我可真完了。

他用尽力气去找这个加不立尔·斯宾塞尔。他描述我的相貌，说出了他认为我所住的地方，总之，关于我的踪迹凡是他知道的他全说了。但是我始终没肯对他说出我的性别，我就占了很大的便宜了，他绝不能打听出我的消息。他为了找我，害得两三家的人都上了公堂，但是他们一点也不知道我的事情，除了我的一个朋友，这个朋友他们虽然看见了，却丝毫也不知道他的事情。至于我的保姆，虽然她是我和他结识的媒介，可是中间另外有一个人，他是完全不认识她的。

这么一来他反害了自己，因为答应了找出他的同谋犯，却又办不到，这好像是故意与法庭开玩笑，那些抓住他的店伙也更加凶猛地来跟他理论了。

然而，在这期间，我感到万分不安，为了好好地躲避起来，我暂时离开我保姆的家。但是不知道向哪里去游荡，我就带了一个女仆，坐公共马车到了但斯铁不尔，我那个旅馆老主人同女主人那里，从前我同我的兰开夏丈夫曾在那里非常舒服地住过。我向她说出一个冠冕堂皇的理由，说我天天等候我丈夫从爱尔兰来，我已经给他去了一封信，告诉他我将在但斯铁不尔她的店里和他相会，假使顺风，他在这几天内一定可以到达，所以我想来这里住几天，等他来时再说。因为我不知道他是坐邮车，还是坐西契斯特的公共马车来。但是不管是哪个车，他一定会到这家旅馆来会我的。

女主人看到我时非常高兴，男主人为我忙得不可开交，即使我是一位公主，也不过如此。假使我以为这办法对我有利，我可以很好地在这里住一两个月。

但是我的目的并不在于休养。我很不安（虽然我假装得很好，几乎无法看出来），害怕那个家伙也许会找出我的下落来。虽然我劝过他不要去冒险，我自己也没有去偷，因此他不能说我这回也犯了罪，但是他却可以说出我犯了别的案子，牺牲了我，去救他自己。

这使我感到非常可怕。我没有可以依赖的人，没有朋友，除了我的保姆以外，没有一个可以推心置腹的人。没有其他办法，只好把我的生命交给她，因此我告诉了她我的通信地址。我住在那里的时候，还接到她几封信。有几封信几乎把我吓坏了，但是最后她告诉了我那可喜的消息，说他已经被绞死了。这是我很久以来所听到的最好的消息。

我在这里住了五个礼拜，的确过得很安闲，但是心里仍然感到焦虑。当我接到这封信的时候，我又高兴起来了，告诉我的女主人说，我接到我丈夫从爱尔兰寄来的信，有一个好消息，那就是他很平安，但是也有一个坏消息，那就是他的事情很忙。不能像原来打算的那么快离开，所以我只好一个人回去了。

女主人知道他平安的消息，便向我祝贺：“因为我看出，太太，”她说，“你不像往常那么高兴。我敢说，你太替他担心了。”这个好女人又说，“很容易看出你现在又快乐了。”“那位先生还不能来，我觉得很遗憾。”男主人说，“假使见到了他，我真的会非常高兴的。我希望，你得到他来的消息时，再到这儿来，太太，无论你什么时候到这儿来，我们总是欢迎的。”

说完这些好听的客气话之后，我们就分手了。我无忧无虑地回到伦敦，看见我的保姆也和我一样的欢喜。她告诉我，她决不再替我介绍伙伴了，因为她总是发现，当我独自冒险的时候，我老碰到好运气。的确是这样的，因为当我一个人干的时候，我很少遇到危险，即使我碰到了难关，也能巧妙地逃脱出来，比起和别人牵连在一起的时候，就方便得多了。他们也许是眼光不及我，却比我更急躁，因为我冒险的胆子虽然并不亚于他们，可是在我做一件事情之前，总是很小心地考虑一下。我逃走的时候，也比他们镇静得多。

我常常甚至于纳闷我自己在这方面为什么这样大胆，我所有的伙伴都被抓住了，受到了法律的制裁，而我现在又很富了，为什么还不下决心，放下这行生意。陷入这种罪恶的主因，贫穷，现在已经消灭了，我身边有将近五百金镑的现款，假使退休的话，靠着这些钱我可以很舒服地生活，但是我说，我连一点放手的念头都没有。不，更不愿罢手了，比起当我只有二百金镑的时候，比起我没看到这类可怕的榜样的时候，我更不愿放手。因此我明白了，罪恶把我们的心硬化了的时候，恐惧不会感动我们，什么榜样也不会警诫我们。

我有一个同伴，她的厄运使我心里难过了好久，虽然我终究渐渐地把她忘了。那件事真是不幸得很。我在一家绸缎铺偷了一块非常值钱的花缎，好好地带了出来，我们走出店门时，我把这块料子交给我这位同伴，各朝不同的方向走去。我们离开那家店不久，绸缎商发现少了一块料子，就派人分两路追查，一会儿他们就捉住我这位带着料子的同伴，把那块花缎从她身上搜了出来。而我倒很侥幸地走进一座楼，那里第二层上有一间花边店，的确可怕得很，我居然从窗子看见他们把这可怜人拖到法官那里去，她立刻就被判决关到新门监狱里去了。

我在那家花边店不敢偷什么东西，却把他们的货物翻腾了一大阵，去消磨时光。然后买了几码花边，付了钱，走出来，心里的确很替那个可怜的女人难过，她是为了我偷的东西而受苦的。

这一次我那种向来不变的谨慎又给我许多好处，那就是说，虽然我常和这些人一起偷东西，可是我绝不让他们知道我是谁，或者住在哪里，他们虽然老是设法跟着我，却总不能到我的住所来。他们都只知道人们叫我荡妇弗兰德斯，有些人还以为这是我的真名字，不知道这只是一个绰号。我这名字对他们是公开的，但是他们不知道怎样去找我，连我住在城里的东头或西头也猜不到。因此这种谨慎使我在任何时候，都没有出过危险。

这个女人的不幸事件发生之后，我在家里躲了很久。我知道假使我干什么事失败了，被送到狱里去，她一定也在那里，并且愿意做证人来控告我，也许把我牺牲了，去救自己的性命。我想我的名字已经为狱吏所熟知了，虽然他们还没有见过我的面目。假使我落到他们手里，他们将会把我当个老犯人看待。因此，我决定先看看这个可怜人的命运如何，然后才敢再到外面活动，虽然她在穷困之中我曾几次派人送钱给她，救济她一下。

最后她受了审判。她申辩说她没有偷这些东西，是一位弗兰德斯太太偷的，她听见人们都这样称呼她的，她自己并不认得这位太太。她们走出铺子的时候，是这位太太把这包东西交给她，叫她带到她自己家里去的。他们问她这位弗兰德斯太太现在住在什么地方，可是她说不出来，关于我的事一点也讲不出来。绸缎铺的伙计们却坚决地赌咒说，货物被偷去的时候，她正在店里，他们发现少了货物，立刻就去追她，果然在她身上找出来了，因此陪审官断定她有罪。但是法庭想到她并不是真正偷东西的人，她实在找不出这位弗兰德斯太太，也是可能的，虽然找到了她就可以救她自己的性命（这话的确是真的）。就判定让她流徙到远方去，这是她所希望的最大恩惠了。法庭还告诉她，假使在流徙以前，她能够找出前面所说的那位弗兰德斯太太，他们可以替她请求赦免。那就是说，假使她能找出我来，交给他们，她就可以不受流徙。我想法子使她找不到我，不久她就被送到远方过流徙的生活了。

我必须再说一遍：这可怜女人的命运使我非常烦恼，我开始感到忧郁，因为我明知道我是她受难的主因。但是我自己的生命过去既是那么危险，现在保住了，就忘掉了一切的感情。看到她并没被处死，而被流徙到远方去，我倒觉得很满意。因为这样一来，无论如何她再也不能加害于我了。

这个女人的不幸事件是发生在我最后所说的那件事的前几个月，的确一半是因为遇到这件不幸的事，我的保姆才提议把我装扮作男人，那么我在外面就不会引起人们的注意。我真的照她的话做了，但是不久我就不愿再装扮男人了，这我在前面已经说过了，因为那的确使我有种种的不便。

现在我不怕有谁作证来告发我了，因为一切和我有过关系的人，或者知道我叫作荡妇弗兰德斯的人不是被绞死，就是受流徙了。假使我不幸被抓住，我可以随便说一个名字，谁也不认得我，也就不能把旧罪加在我身上了。所以我又开始活动起来，而且更大胆了，我做了几次成功的冒险，虽然不像从前那样走运。

那时候离我保姆家不远的地方又着了一次火，我又想像从前那样去试一试，但是我没来得及，群众先涌进去了，我因此不能走近我的目的地。我不但没有得到什么东西，倒碰上一件倒霉的事，几乎把我的生命和我一切的罪恶都结束了。那时火势正猛，人们正恐慌地抢运东西，从窗子里扔出来，一个姑娘从窗口扔出一个羽毛垫子，刚好压着我。那垫子是软的，当然没有把我的骨头折断。但是那重量可也不轻，从上面扔下来势头很猛，因此把我打倒在地下，使我晕过去好大一会儿。但是人们没赶快把我救起来，或者想法把我弄醒。我躺在那儿，像个死人似的，也没人理会，直到有人要把那垫子挪开时，才看见我，把我扶起来。说也奇怪，那家的人再也没有往垫子上扔什么东西，不然的话，早把我压死了。我活了下去，继续受苦。

可是，这件意外的不幸使我暂时不能做生意了，我回到我保姆那里，带着重伤，害怕到了极点。过了许久，她才再叫我到外面去。

现在是一年里最快乐的时候，巴塞罗缪市场已经开市了。我从前没有到过那里，因为市场通常对于我没有多大好处。但是今年我到那里去溜达了一趟，走进一家卖彩票的店铺。那对于我是没有多大关系的，我也不想从中发财。但是来了一位绅士，穿得极讲究，看来很有钱的样子。在这类铺子里，大家都是随便说话的，他就跟我谈话，对我非常殷勤。开头他告诉我他要替我买一张彩票。他果然买了，得到一件小玩意儿，就送给了我，我想那是一个毛制的暖手筒。然后他更殷勤地继续跟我谈天，但是仍然很有礼貌，很像一位绅士。

他和我谈了许久，最后带我走出那家彩票店，然后在市场里散步，还是乱七八糟地谈些不相干的话。最后他不客气地告诉我他很喜欢和我在一起，问我敢不敢跟他同坐一辆马车。他告诉我，他是顾全名誉的人，绝不会对我干出不名誉的事。起初我装出不同意的样子，让他再三请求之后，就答应了。

我起先心里猜不出这位先生到底是什么意思，但是后来我发现他已经喝了酒，有点糊涂了，而且他还想再喝一些。他坐着马车带我到武士桥附近的春园去，在那园里我们散了一会儿步，然后他非常客气地招待我吃饭，但是我看他又喝了很多酒。他劝我也喝一些，我却谢绝了。

一直到这时，他始终坚守着他的诺言，对我没有一点不规矩的举动。我们又坐上马车，他带我到街上去，那时已经快到晚上十点钟了。他叫马车停在一所房子的前面，他好像是很熟悉那里，人们立即把我们引到楼上一间有床铺的房子里。起先我好像不愿意上去，但是他说了几句话之后，我就答应了，因为我想看一看到底是怎么回事，还希望着最后能够得点东西。至于床铺等等，我是不大关心的。

到了这里以后他开始有些放纵起来。我渐渐地答应了他一切的要求，总之，让他为所欲为，我也用不着再说什么了。就在这时候，他还是尽情地喝酒，早上一点钟左右，我们又坐上马车走了。外面的空气和马车的摇动使他的酒劲涌上头来，他在车里觉得不舒服，想再干他起先所干的事。但是我觉得他已经在我的掌握之中，于是就拒绝了他，让他安静一会儿。可是还不到五分钟，他就睡熟了。

我乘这机会把他仔细地搜查了一遍。我拿去一只金表，一丝袋的金钱，漂亮的、有宽平底的假发，镶银的手套，还有剑和漂亮的鼻烟盒子。然后我轻轻地把车门打开，当马车还走着的时候预备跳下去。但是这车在田波尔·巴街旁边的一条小街上停住，让另一辆马车过去的时候，我轻轻地走下车，又把车门关好，这样我和这位先生以及这马车就不辞而别了。

这真是一件出乎我意料的冒险，我自己是毫无用心的。虽然当一个傻瓜被自己的肉欲弄得盲目了，分不出年老和年轻的女人的时候，我并没有完全失去青春的心情，竟会不知道怎样去做。我的外貌的确显得比我实在的年纪年轻十年或者十二年。然而我也不是个二八年华的姑娘，这是很容易分辨出来的。天下再没有比被酒和情欲刺激着的人更荒谬，更可厌，更可笑的了。他同时被这两个魔鬼抓住，再也不能用理性来管束自己了。他正像一个没有水的磨一样，罪恶践踏了他一切善良的心。不，他的理智被他的肉欲弄糊涂了，他甚至做出荒唐透顶的事情。他已经喝醉了，还要喝，随便找一个普通的女人，完全不了解她是干什么的，是哪一类的女人，不管是好的，还是坏的；是干净的，还是不干净的；是俊的，还是丑的；是老的，还是少的。他盲目了，简直不去分辨。这样的人还不如一个疯子。在他那邪恶的、糊涂的念头怂恿下，这个坏蛋不知道自己在干些什么，而我却从他衣袋里偷去了他的表和他的钱。

所罗门说：“他们像一只牛往死亡走去，等到标枪刺穿他们的肝时才知道。”他所指的就是这种人。这句话也可以用来描写那种肮脏的病，那是一种致命的毒液和身体里的血混在一起的疾病，这种毒液集中的地方，或者总源就是肝。从那里，靠着这块混合物的迅速流转，这可怕的，使人恶心的毒立刻刺入男人的肝脏，他的血液就染上梅毒，他的要害就好像被一杆标枪刺穿了。

这个可怜的，不小心的糊涂虫从我这里倒不会受到什么危险，我起先还很担心，他会传染给我什么毛病。但是另一方面，他的确是值得怜悯的。他好像是个好人，一个不怀恶意的绅士，一个懂道理的人，举止可爱，态度文雅。他有一副安详的相貌，美丽动情的面孔以及一切可爱的性质。只是不幸得很，昨天晚上喝了些酒，他告诉我，直到我们在一起的时候，他还没有睡觉。他心里焦躁，他的血被酒燃着了，在这种情形之下，他的理智好像睡着了，不去约束他了。

至于我，我的目的是要他的钱和他的一切东西。拿了这些东西之后，我真愿意送他平安地回到家里和他家人的身边，假使我能想到办法的话。因为十有八九他有个诚实有德的妻子和天真的孩子，他们都为他担心。假使能够带他回家，看护着他，一直等到他恢复过来，他们一定会非常高兴。那时他回想起自己所做的一切，他将多么害羞，多么悔恨呀！他将怎样责备自己，竟会同一个荡妇结合！而且是在最下流的地方，市场，找来的，从城里最肮脏的地方弄来的！因为害怕得了梅毒，害怕一杆标枪已经刺穿了他的肝，他将怎样地战栗，每次回想起他这次的疯狂和兽性毕露，他将怎样地痛恨自己！假使他有廉耻之心，想到他会把什么恶疾——他认为他会可能有的——传染给他这位忠厚有德的太太，让他后代子孙的血液里也种下那毒液的根苗，他将多么厌恶自己。

如果这些先生们想想跟他们胡闹的女人竟会对他们有这样鄙视的看法，他们一定会觉得恶心。像我上面所说的，她们并不看重那种欢乐，她们不是出于喜欢那个男人，这种被动的贱妇想的不是欢乐，却是金钱。当他陶醉于这种邪恶的欢乐的时候，她的手却在他的衣袋里寻找她所能找到的一切，这个举动他在他糊涂的时候一点也不觉得，正像他瞎闹的时候，一点也预料不到一样。

我知道一个女人，她的确很会对付一个男人。当他正跟她忙着干另一件事的时候，她把他一个放了二十个金币的钱袋从他裤子的表袋里拿出，他起先放在那里原是怕她偷去的。她又把另一袋镀金的假币放在原来的地方。这男人遇到这件事也真是活该。他干完事之后，问她：“你扒了我的袋子没有？”她跟他开玩笑说，她想他没有什么值得偷的。他把手放在裤子的表袋上，摸了摸，发现他的钱包仍在里面，他觉得很满意，于是她就带着他的钱跑了。这是她干的生意，她身上总带着一块假金表和一袋假金币，预备这种时候用，我相信她干得是很成功的。

我带着前面所说的赃物回到我保姆家里，当我告诉她这段经过时，她想到这位先生每次酒劲上来都有受骗的危险，感动得不禁流下泪来。

我告诉她怎样得到的东西以及怎样把他劫得精光的经过，她听后觉得很高兴。“不，孩子，”她说，“据我所知，这样对待他也许比他一生所听到的劝诫都更能使他悔改。”下面的叙述就可以证明这句话了。

我发现第二天她老向我探问这位先生。我向她形容了一番，他的衣服，他的身材，他的面貌，这一切都恰好使她想起一位先生，她知道他的家庭。她沉默了一会儿，我还是继续谈着详细的情形。她忽然说道：“我可以跟你赌一百金镑，我认得这位先生。”

“如果你认得他，我就太抱歉了，”我说，“因为无论如何，我总不该让他丢脸。他已经受够了损害，我绝不让他再吃亏。”

“不，不，”她说，“我一定不害他，请你相信，但是请你让我满足一下好奇心，因为假使真是他，我敢向你担保我能找出他的底细。”我听到这句话有点吃惊，脸上现出很忧虑的样子，对她说，那么同样他也可以找出我的底细，那么我岂不完了。她热烈地回答道：“那么，你以为我会出卖你吗，孩子？不，不，即使把他在世界上所有的财产给我，我也不肯。我替你守了比这更大的秘密。这件事你总该相信我吧。”于是我就不说话了。

她的计划是在别处，她没有告诉我，但是她决心要找出他的底细。她于是去拜访一位朋友，那个女人认识她所猜的这家人。她告诉她的朋友，她有一件非常要紧的事要同这位绅士商量（那位绅士头衔不小，的确是一位从男爵，而且家世很好），假使没有人介绍的话，她不知道怎样去见他。她的朋友欣然答应替她去办这件事，就到那家去看这位绅士是否还在城里。

第二天她来找我的保姆，告诉她某某爵士正在家里，但是他近来遇到一件不幸的事，感觉很不舒服，人们绝没有可能和他交谈。“什么不幸的事？”我的保姆急忙问道，好像她听了有些吃惊似的。“哎呀，”她的朋友说，“他到汉姆斯特去拜会他相识的一个绅士，回来的时候，被人拦抢了。有人猜测，他既然喝了点酒，那些流氓就欺侮他，他现在很难受。”

“被抢了！”我的保姆说，“他们抢了他什么东西？”

“哎呀，”她的朋友说，“他们抢去他的金表，他的金鼻烟盒，他的漂亮假发和他袋里所有的钱，我敢说钱一定是不少的，因为××爵士出门时身边总是带着一袋金币。”

“咄！”我的保姆讥笑道，“我敢向你担保，他是喝醉了，找了一个婊子，她扒去了他的东西。他回到他妻子那里，告诉她被抢了。这是一个老把戏。天天有成千成万的人拿这种诡计来欺骗可怜的女人。”

“嗤！”她的朋友说道，“我想你不了解××爵士。哎呀，他是个再有礼貌不过的绅士，全城里找不出一个更高尚，更明理，更庄重，更知耻的人。他厌恶这一类的事。凡是认识他的人都不会想到他会干这样的事。”

“好吧，好吧，”我的保姆说，“这事和我也不相干；不过既然我这样说，我敢说我一定有些根据。你们大家所谓的知耻君子有时并不比别人高明，只是他们有个较好的名声，或者可以说他们是手段更高明的伪君子。”

“不，不，”她的朋友说，“我能够向你保证××爵士绝不是一个伪君子。他真是一个诚实端庄的绅士，他的确被人抢了。”

“不，”我的保姆说，“也许他被人抢了，这事和我无关，我已经告诉你了。我只想和他说话，我是为别的事来的。”

“但是，”她的朋友说，“不管你是什么事，你现在还不能见他，因为他不宜于见客，因为他很难过，他受了重伤。”

“那么，”我的保姆说，“他必定落到了坏人手里。”然后她郑重地问，“请问你，他哪里受了伤？”

“噢，是头上，”她的朋友说，“一只手，还有脸上都受了伤，他们对他太野蛮了。”

“可怜的绅士，”我的保姆说，“那么，我只好等他复原再来吧，”她还说，“我希望他不久就会好。”

然后她回来告诉了我这段故事。“我发现了那位好绅士，他的确是个好人，”她说，“但是，天呀，他现在弄得很可怜。我不知道你跟他捣了什么鬼。哎呀，你几乎杀死他了。”我异常慌乱地看着她。“我杀死了他！”我说，“你一定把人弄错了，我敢说我丝毫没有伤害他。我离开他的时候，他是很好的，不过喝醉了，睡得很熟。”

“这我是一点也不知道的，”她说，“可是他现在弄得很可怜。”她于是把她朋友的话全告诉了我。

“那么，”我说，“他准是在我离开之后，落到坏人手里，因为我相信我离开他的时候，他是很好的。”

大约十天之后，我的保姆又到她的朋友那里，请她介绍和这位绅士谈话。她先从别处打听好，知道他虽然还没有出过门，可是已经能走动了，她于是和他见了面。

她是一个善于辞令的女人，用不着谁来替她说好话。她说明她的来意比我现在所能转述的强得多，因为她是个会用舌头的女人，我在前面已经说过了。她告诉他，她虽然是一个陌生人，却是抱着替他出力的心意而来的，他会看出她并没有其他的目的。她既然纯粹为着友谊而来，就要求他答应一件事，就是即使他不接受她这样好管闲事所提出的建议，也不要因为她干预了和她不相干的事而不高兴。她请他相信，她要说的话是只有她一个人知道的秘密，所以无论他接受或者不接受她的建议，别人绝不会知道这个秘密，除非他自己把它泄露出来。即使他不肯让她出力，她也不会对他表示丝毫的不敬，以致对他有什么不利的举动，所以他完全可以按照自己的意思决定。

他起先显出很害羞的样子，说他想不出哪件和他有关的事情需要这样保守秘密。他从来没有害过什么人，别人怎样说，他是毫不在乎的。他从来不欺侮任何人，也想不出在哪方面别人有替他出力的必要。不过，假使真像她所说的她愿毫无私地为他出力，他自然不能因为人家想来帮他的忙而觉得不高兴。所以告诉他或者不告诉他，可以随她的便。

看到他这么冷淡，她几乎不敢和他谈了。但是，说了几句别的话之后，她告诉他，由于某种奇怪的、偶然的机会，她对于他近来的不幸事情知道得很详细，不过世界上除了他自己和她之外，还没有第三个人知道这件事，不，甚至连跟他有关的那个人也不知道。

他起先显出有些生气的样子。“什么事情？”他说。“就是你在来斯不力——不，先生，我该说你走过汉姆斯特时候，被抢的那件事请你不要担心。先生，听到我能够说出你那天一步步的行动，从斯密士飞鲁的广场到来斯不力的春园，然后到斯徒莲底街的某家屋里，以及后来你怎样剩得一个人在马车里熟睡。我说，请你不要担心，因为，先生，我不是来敲你的竹杠的，我对你没有任何要求，我请你相信那次跟你在一起的女人根本不知道你是谁，而且永远也不会知道。不过也许我还可以帮你一点忙，因为我不单是来告诉你我知道了这件事，好像我想得到一笔贿赂，把这事隐藏起来似的。不，请你相信，先生，”她说，“无论你怎样对待我或者对我怎样说，我决不把这秘密说出，一直到我进入坟墓。”

他听到她的话很惊奇，严肃地对她说：“太太，我不认识你，但是不幸得很，你却知道这个秘密。这是我生平所做的最坏的事，我应当感到惭愧，对于这事我唯一的安慰是，我想这事只有上天和我自己的良心知道。”

“请您，先生，”她说，“别把我知道了这件事当作您的不幸。我相信，这是一件你料想不到的事情，也许是那个女人用了些诡计引诱你作出来的。无论如何，你绝没充足的理由。”她说，“我后悔听到了这件事，就连你自己的嘴也不见得比我一向更缄默，我将永远保持那样的缄默。”

“好吧，”他说，“但是让我对那个女人也说句公道话。不管她是谁，我请你相信，她丝毫没有勾引我，她倒是拒绝我的。那完全是我自己的愚蠢和疯狂使我走到那样的地步。是的，而且使她也走到那样的地步，这是我应当替她辩明的。至于她拿去我的东西，我当时既是那样的情形，自然不能期望有别的结果，一直到现在，我还不知道到底是她还是那个马车夫抢去了我的东西。假使是她干的，我宽恕她，我想一切做这类事情的先生们都该受这样的对待。但是还有一点比起她从我身上所拿去的一切东西更使我担心。”

我的保姆现在开始详细地谈这件事了，他也坦白地向她说出自己的事。第一，她回答他刚才说到我的话。她说：“先生。你对和你在一起的那个女人那么公平，我真高兴，我请你相信，她是一位好妇人，并不是娼妓。不管你跟她干的是什么，我敢说这不是她的职业。你的确冒了一次很大的危险，先生。但是假使你为这事担心，我想你完全没有必要，因为我敢向你担保，自她丈夫死了之后，在你之前没有人接触过她，而她丈夫差不多已经死了八年了。”

这似乎正是他的忧愁，对于这点他非常恐惧，因此，当我的保姆向他这样说时，他显出很高兴的样子，说：“太太，好吧，向你说一句坦白的话，如果我能对这点放心，至于失去的东西，我是不大计较的。因为这些东西是有很大诱惑力的，也许她是个穷人，需要这些东西。”

“假使她不穷——先生，”我的保姆说道，“我敢对你说她绝不至于让你那样干。她的穷困既让你随心所欲地去做，就不能不让她最后替自己找一个报酬，当她看到你醉倒的时候，即使她不抢你，马车夫或者轿夫也会抢你的。”

“好吧，”他说，“希望这些东西对她有很多的好处。我还要说一遍，一切干这类事情的先生们都该受同样的对待，然后他们才会谨慎些。我对于这事没有别的可担心的，除了你刚才所指出的那个缘故，太太。”于是他就有些放肆地向她说起我们两人之间的事情，那是不宜于一个女人写下来的。然后他又说他心里最大的恐惧是关于他的太太，害怕他从我这里得到什么毛病，再传到她身上。最后问她能否替他找一个和我谈话的机会。我的保姆又向他说了许多，保证我是一个绝无这种毛病的女人，他和我在一起和与自己的太太一样安全。至于和我见面，她说这也许会带来危险的结局。然而她将和我谈一下，让他知道我的回话。同时她说出种种理由劝他不要见我，这对他是毫无用处的。她希望他不再想和我恢复那种往来，就我这方面来说，和他见面几乎是把我的生命放在他手里。

他告诉她他很想见到我，他愿意给她一切他所能给的担保，不来乘机谋害我，首先他愿意不向我提出任何的要求。她坚持说这样就更容易泄露秘密，也许最后会对他有所不利，请他别再固执。这样他就不再要求了。

他们还谈到他所丢的东西，他似乎很想收回他的金表，于是对她说如果她能替他找回，他愿出这只表应值的价钱。她答应将努力替他找回，出多少钱，随他自己的便。

于是第二天她就把那只表送去，他给了她三十个金币，这个数目比我所能卖的要多，虽然这表买起来似乎还值得多些。他又谈到他的假发，那大约是花了六十个金币买的，和他的鼻烟盒。过了几天，她又把它们带去，这使他很感激，又给了她三十个金币。第二天，我又把他的漂亮的剑和杖送去，没要他的钱，也没有向他提出什么要求。但是我不想见他，除非他愿意让我知道他是谁，这是他不肯答应的。

然后他跟她谈了很久关于她怎样知道这全部的事情的经过。她虚构出很长的一段故事，说她怎样听一个人说出了我的全部经过，那人是帮我去变卖这些东西的。因为她是开当铺的，这个心腹把这许多东西拿到她那里去。她听说爵士大人的不幸，就猜出这件事情的大概。那些东西得手之后，她就决定来试试看。她然后一再向他申说这事绝不会从她嘴里透露出来，虽然她和那个女人——指我——很熟，然而她并没有让她知道他是谁。这确是一个谎言，然而这对他也没有坏处，因为我绝没有对谁说出他的姓名。

关于再和他见面的事，我想了很久，常常追悔我不该拒绝了他。我深信假使我见到他，让他知道我知道他，我就可以得到一些好处，也许他肯维持我的生活。虽然这是很坏的一种生活，但绝不至于像我所过的那种生活那么危险。然而，这种想法打消之后，我又不想见他了。可是我的保姆常去见他，他待她很好，几乎每次见到她时都给她一点东西。尤其有一回她看到他很高兴，她想他大概又喝了些酒，他又再三地要求让他见到那个女人，那个在那天晚上使他那样着迷的女人。我的保姆一向是赞成他和我会面的，就对他说，他既是这么想见我，假使她能够劝得动我她是可以答应的。她还说假使他肯晚上到她家里来，她将设法去办好这件事。他还一再申说他宽恕了我过去的一切。

于是她来到我这里，告诉我全部的谈话经过。总之，我本来心里有些追悔从前不该回绝了他，所以她很快就使我答应了。于是我预备见他。我尽我的能力，把自己打扮得漂亮些，这是我第一次用些人工。我说第一次，是因为我从前绝不肯自甘于下流用脂粉来涂脸的。我老是很骄傲，自信我是用不着这些东西的。

约好的时间一到，他就来了。一看就知道正像她所说的，他喝了酒，虽然跟所谓的烂醉还差得很远。他看到我现出非常高兴的样子，和我谈了许久以往的事情。我再三地求他原谅，声明我刚一见他时，绝没这样的打算。假使我不认为他是一个很有礼貌的绅士，并且一再向我保证对我不会有非礼举动，我绝不会和他一同走出去。

他提到他那回喝醉了，他几乎不知道自己干的什么事，假使不是这样，他绝不会对我有那种举动。他向我声明自从和他太太结婚之后，除我之外他没有和别的女人接触过，那次的事是出乎他的意料的。他赞美我在他眼里多么称心，以及这类的话。他老谈着那件事，最后我看出他几乎把自己的火燃起了，想再干那件事。但是我顿然止住了他。我抗议说，自从我丈夫死后，我从来没有和哪个男人接触过，那差不多已经八年了。他说他相信这话是真的，还说那位太太也对他讲过这样的话，他对于这点深信不疑，因此想再来见我。他既是和我干了一次不道德的事，发现没有出什么毛病，那么他再来这儿胡闹当然是没有危险的。总之，结果他又干出了我所预料的不堪叙述的事情。

我的老保姆和我一样，也料到了这一点，所以她引他进了一间房子，里面虽然没有床铺，却通到一间有床铺的小屋，我们就到那里面去过夜。总之，我们在一块儿待了一些时候之后，他就去睡觉了，而且在那里躺了一夜。我回到自己房中，但是在天亮之前不穿衣服又回到那里，同他一直躺到早上。

你们看，做了一回坏事就不免再做一回坏事。当引诱重现在面前的时候，一切的追悔和自责全消失了。假使我没有答应再和他见面，他心里的下流欲望也许会渐渐消失，也许他跟任何其他女人也不会再发生这种关系，因为我确信他以前是绝没有干过这种事的。

当他要走的时候，我对他说我希望他看清楚并没有再被抢劫。他对我说他感到很满意，于是把手插到口袋里，拿出五个金币给我。这是我许多年来第一次干这种事得来的钱。

他这样来看过我好几次，但是他从未向我说定每月给我多少生活费，实际上那是我最希望的。有一回，他的确问我怎样过活。我立刻告诉他，我从来没干过像跟他所干的这种营生，我专做女红，刚好可以维持生活。有时我所得的只够糊口，谋生真是太困难了。

他似乎想到他是第一个无意之中带我走上这条路的人。他说，想到他是我的罪恶的源泉，感到很痛心。他还常常去想罪恶的本身，去想自己犯罪的一切经过：酒怎样引起他的欲望，魔鬼怎样带他到那个地方，又找出一件东西来引诱他，他自己也常常感到后悔。

他心里有这些想法的时候，他就走开，也许有一两个月的时间不到我这儿来。但是严肃的念头一打消，淫荡的念头又出现了，然后他又来做那种坏事。我们就这样过了不少日子。虽然他没有像人们所说的，出一定的钱让我当他的姘头，可是他每次给我的报酬都很优厚。我用不着再做女红，用不着再操我的旧业，也够维持生活了。

但是这事也有到头的时候。因为一年之后，他就不像往常那么常来了，最后竟完全不来了。他既没有说出有什么不满，也没有向我告别，就这样结束了这短短的生活的一幕，结果不但没有增加我的积蓄，反而增加了我的忏悔。

这段时间，大部分时间我都待在家里。既然有人供给我的费用，我当然用不着去冒险，不，他离开我以后，有三个月我都没有出去。但是看看没有来钱了，又不愿意花费历来的积蓄，于是我又想到旧生意，重新跑到街上去。我第一次的冒险是很幸运的。

我穿了一套很糟的粗布衣服，因为我可以打扮成好几种样子。我现在就穿了一件普通的长布衣，一条绿色的围裙，戴了一顶草帽，站在圣约翰街三杯客栈的门口。有好几个脚夫常在这家店里兜生意，而到巴奈特、图妥里支和那条路上的其他城镇去的公共马车在黄昏时候都停在这条街上。所以当它们预备出发的时候，我就等候着有什么机会出现。人们常常带着大包和小包来到这些客栈里，叫脚夫来照顾它们。那里又常有女人们，是脚夫的妻子或女儿，她们替他们把东西拿进去。

当我站在客栈门口的时候，很凑巧有一个到巴奈特去的公共马车的脚夫的老婆也站在那里。她看见我，问我是不是等一辆马车。我对她说：“是，我在等候我的女主人，她要坐马车到巴奈特去。”她问我谁是我的女主人，我告诉她我随便想起的一位太太的姓名。但是我刚好说出了住在巴奈特附近黑德莱地方的一个人家的姓。

有好一会儿，我们彼此没有说什么话。但是又过了一会儿，有人从隔几家的一个门口叫她，她告诉我如果有人找要到巴奈特去的公共马车，我就到那家去叫她，那里仿佛是一家酒店。我很欣然地答应了她。

她刚一走开，立刻就来了一个姑娘和一个小孩，喘着气，流着汗，问哪辆是到巴奈特去的公共马车。我立刻回答说：“这儿。”

“你是巴奈特公共马车的人吗？”她问。

“是的，亲爱的，”我说，“你有什么事？”

“我要给这两位客人找座位。”她说。

“她们在哪里，亲爱的？”我说。

“一位是这个女孩，请让她上车吧，”她说，“我再去请我的女主人。”

“那么就赶快去，亲爱的，”我说，“否则我们的车子就坐满了人啦。”那个姑娘夹着一个大包袱，她把那小孩放在车上之后，我就说，“你最好也把那个大包袱搁在车子上。”

“不，”她说，“我怕有人会偷走。”

“那么交给我吧，”我说，“我替你看着。”

“好吧，”她说，“请你千万小心看着。”

“我愿负完全责任，”我说，“就算值二十个金镑。”

“拿去吧。”她说完就跑开了。

我拿过这个大包袱，那姑娘一离开，我就向着脚夫老婆所去的那家酒店走去，所以即使碰到她，我也只像是把这个大包袱给她送去，叫她回来干她的事，似乎我要走开，不能再等她了。但是我没有碰到她，我就走开了，转进察忒豪斯巷，由察忒豪斯围场逃到长巷，然后穿过巴塞罗缪广场，又从小不列颠巷走到蓝衣医院，最后到了新门街。

为了避免被人认出，我脱下我的蓝围裙，用它包起我的大包袱，那个大包袱原来是用一块印花布包着的。我把我的草帽也包在里头，把这个大包袱顶在头上。我这样做是很好的，因为走过蓝衣医院时，太凑巧了，我居然碰到起先请我代拿这个大包袱的那位姑娘。她好像正和她去找来的那位女主人一同往巴奈特马车走去。

我看她很匆忙的样子，当然用不着拦住她。于是她走过去了，我安全地把我这包东西带到我保姆那里。包里没有钱，也没有金银器皿同珠宝，却有一身非常好的印度花缎衣服，一件长褂和裙子，一些非常好的佛兰德斯花边做成的帽子和袖口，此外还有些别的东西，这些东西的价钱我是很清楚的。

这的确不是我自己想出来的办法，却是一位常干这种勾当的人传授给我的，我的保姆非常喜欢这个办法。我以后又试了好几次，虽然我没有在同一个地方试过两次。我又在槐特察拍尔街试了一次，那是在弼贴可特巷转弯的地方，往斯脱拉福·保街和那一带地方去的公共马车都停在那儿。又有一回在俾查斯盖特街口飞马饭店门前，那时候往支斯敦去的公共马车正停在那儿。我每次都很走运，总得到一些赃物。

有一次我站在码头边一家货栈前面，从北方泰因新堡，孙德兰这些地方来的海船都停在那里。这时货栈门已经关了，忽然来了一个年轻人，手里拿着一封信。他要领取由泰因新堡运来的一箱子和一大篮货物。我问他知道不知道上面标有什么记号。他就把信让我看，他是以这封信为凭据来领东西的，信里说明了是什么货物：箱子里全是布匹，大篮里全是玻璃器皿。我念了这封信，留心记住了船名，记号，寄件人姓名，收件人姓名。然后，我叫取东西的人第二天早上来，因为货栈的看守人那天晚上不会再来了。

我走了以后就假造了一封新堡约翰·里查孙先生给他在伦敦城他的亲爱的表弟杰姆·柯尔的一封信，里面说他托某某船（我是把一切细节记得毫无遗漏的）送上多少匹粗麻布，多少尺荷兰绒和其他布匹，都装在一个大箱里，还有一篮的上等玻璃器皿，那是从亨齐尔先生玻璃厂里买来的；箱子上面有“I．C．NO．1”的记号，篮子的绳子上面系着一张写明地址的标签。

差不多过了一个钟头，我又来到货栈，找到看守货栈的人，毫不费事地把这些货物拿到手里了。仅那些布匹已经值二十二金镑了。

我还能说出很多这类的冒险，我天天都有新的妙计，干得极端巧妙，老是非常成功。

但是天网恢恢疏而不漏，最后我终于遭到了一场小小的风波，虽然不能致我死命，可是我被人知道了，这种不幸仅比判罪强一点罢了。

我曾经扮作一个孀妇，这并没有什么具体的目的，只是等候有什么凑巧的机会，我常这样做。当我走过考芬特花园的一条街时，偶然听到大声呼喊“捉贼！捉贼！”好像有几位同行跟一家店铺捣鬼，被人们一追，有的往这条路跑，有的往那条路跑。他们说里面有一个穿着寡妇的丧服，于是群众就把我包围了，有人说我就是那个贼，也有人说不是。被抢的绸缎店的伙计立刻跑来，他大声赌咒说我是那个人，就把我抓住。然而，当我被群众带回绸缎店时，店里的老板坦白地说，我不是起先在他店里的那个女人，他可以让我立刻走开。但是另一个人严肃地说：“请等到××先生（指一个伙计）回来，因为他认得她。”他们把我拘留了将近半个钟头。

他们叫了一位警察，他站在店里看守着我。我和警察谈天的时候，问他住在哪里，担任什么职务。那个人丝毫没有预料到后来发生的许多事情，顺嘴告诉了我他的姓名和住址。还开玩笑对我说，当我到监狱的时候，我一定会听到人们提起他的名字。

有几个仆人对我很无礼，要他们的手不碰我是很难的。老板待我比他们的确好一些，但是他还是不让我走，虽然他承认我没有到他店里来过。

我开始有点对他生气了，告诉他假若有一天我向他报复的时候，他可不要生气。我请他让我找朋友们来看看我有没有受人家欺侮。不，他说，他不能给我这种自由。我告诉他，当我来到法官面前时，我也可以这样要求。他看到我威吓他，就更要把我守住，将来好稳稳地把我送到新门监狱去。我告诉他现在是他得意，可是不久就会是我得意了。我尽力克制我的愤怒。我请警察替我叫一个脚夫来，脚夫来了，我于是要笔、墨水和纸，但是他们一件也不肯给我。我问那个脚夫姓什么，住在哪里，那个可怜的人很欣然地告诉了我。我请他看看而且记住我在这里怎样受人虐待。请他注意我在这里是被人们用武力拘留的。我告诉他我将来在别的地方需要他的证明，他讲出来对他也不会有什么不利。脚夫说他很愿意帮我的忙。“但是。太太，”他说，“让我听听他们为什么不许你走，那么，我将来可以说得明白了。”

听了这话，我大声对那家店里的老板说道：“先生，你的良心知道我不是你所要找的人，而且我起先没有到你店里来过，所以我请你不要再把我拘留在这里，否则就告诉我你拦住我的理由。”那个人听了这话变得比以前更加粗暴，说这两件事他都不能答应，等到他高兴的时候才行。“很好，”我对警察和脚夫说道，“先生们，当我们在别处相会的时候，请你们记住这句话。”那个脚夫说道：“是的，太太。”那个警察开始觉得不妙，劝那个老板准他走开，也让我走，因为，像他所说的，他自认我不是那个人。“好先生，”老板讥笑地对他说道，“你是一个法官，还是一个警察？我叫你看管他，请你尽你的责任。”那个警察有一点动怒，但是很漂亮地对他说，“我知道我的责任，以及我是做什么的，先生，我却怀疑你不大知道你是在干什么。”他们说了几句互相嘲骂的话，这时候，伙计们大胆无礼到极点，对我非常野蛮，最初抓着我的那个人，竟声言要搜我，开始把手放在我身上。我唾了他一口，大声叫那警察看看他怎样对待我。“请你，警察先生，问问这个恶棍叫什么名字。”我手指着那个人说。那警察很客气地责备了他几句，对他说他不知道他在做什么，因为他知道老板承认我不是起先到他店里的那个人。“而且，”那警察说道，“我恐怕你的老板会给他自己和我找很多的麻烦，如果这位太太说出了她是谁，住在哪里。而且她不是你们所猜想的那个女人的话。”

“她该死，”那个伙计又说道，显出一种蛮横强硬的表情，“她就是那个女人，这点我敢担保。我敢打赌她就是起先在店里，我亲手交给她那块失掉的缎子的女人。威廉先生和安东尼先生（这两个也是伙计）回来的时候你就会知道的。他们也和我一样地认得她。”

这个无礼的流氓正这样和警察说话的时候，他所谓的威廉先生和安东尼先生，还有一大群瞧热闹的人，带着那个寡妇回来了。他们流着汗，喘着气，走进店里，显出得胜的神气，用最野蛮的态度，把这个可怜的人拖到他们老板那里去。那时他正在店后，他们就大声喊道：“那个寡妇来了，先生，我们到底把她抓住了。”

“你们说什么？”老板说。“我们已经把她捉来了，她坐在那里××先生赌咒说他能证明她就是那个人。”他们叫作安东尼先生的那个伙计答道，“××先生随他怎么说，随他怎么赌咒，的确是我们抓到这个女人的，这就是她偷去的那块零头缎子，这是我亲手从她衣服里拿出来的。”

现在我心里开始高兴，但只是微笑，不哼一声。老板脸色发白，警察转过身来，看着我。“别管他们，警察先生，”我说，“让他们争下去吧。”这案子很清楚，不能否认，所以他们就叫警察看管那个真贼，而绸缎商也非常客气地对我说，他很抱歉，弄出这个错误，希望我不要生气。他们天天都遇到这类的事情，真不能怪他们做得过分严厉。“不要生气，先生！”我说，“我怎么能不生气呢？假使你那个无礼的伙计在街上抓住我，把我带到你的面前，你自认我不是那个人的时候，就把我放了，那么我就不计较、不生气了，因为我相信你们天天遇到许多这类不幸的事情。但是你对我的态度一直是不能忍受的，尤其是你那个无礼的手下，我一定对这事进行报复。”

然后他开始跟我谈判，说他愿意答应我在合理范围之内的任何要求，希望我告诉他所希望的是什么。我告诉他我不愿自己当审判官，法律会替我决定一切。他既然要把我带到法官面前，就让他到那里去听我要说的话吧。他对我说现在用不着到法官那里去了，我可以随便到任何地方去。他于是把那警察叫来，告诉他可以让我走，因为我已经被释放了。那位警察冷静地对他说道：“先生，你刚才问我知道不知道我是个法官，还是个警察，叫我尽我的责任，把这位太太交给我，当作一个犯人看管。现在，先生，我看出你不知道什么是我的责任，因为你真把我当成法官了。但是我得告诉你，这超乎我的权限之外。当人们把犯人交给我的时候，我可以看守他，但是只有法律和法官才能够释放犯人。所以这是一个错误，先生。我现在必须把她带到法官面前，不管你觉得好不好。”绸缎商起先对那警察吵得很凶，可是那位警察不是一个随便雇来的警察，却是个有把握，有用处的人（我想他是一个米商），又是个懂事理的人，他坚持到底，非到法官面前绝不肯释放我。我也是坚持要到法庭去。绸缎商看到这种情形，就对警察说：“好吧，你爱把她带到哪里就带到哪里。我和她无话可说。”

“但是，先生，”那警察说道，“我希望你肯陪我们一起去，因为是你把她交给我的。

“不，我不，”绸缎商说，“我告诉你，我和她是无话可说的。”

“但是，请你走吧，先生，”警察说道，“我为了你好请你走，因为没有你，法庭是不能审判的。”

“老兄，”绸缎商说道，“请你干你自己的事情去吧。我告诉你，我和她是无话可说的。我用皇帝的名义请你释放了她。”

“先生，”那警察说，“我看出你不知道当警察的该做什么，请你不要逼我对你动粗。”

“我想我用不着，你已经够野蛮了。”绸缎商说。

“不，先生，”警察说，“我并不野蛮。你把一个无罪的女人，在她做合法的事情的时候从街上拖来，关在你的店里，让伙计们虐待她，你这就破坏了治安。难道你能说我野蛮吗？我想我没有用皇帝的名义命令你和我同走，没有叫个个走过你门前的人都来帮我用武力把你带走，就对你很客气了。你一定知道我是有这种权力的。然而我一直忍耐着，我再求你一次，跟我同走。”听了这话，他还是不肯走，而且骂那个警察。可是，那警察压制着自己的怒气，不肯发起火来。那时候我插嘴进去，说道：“警察先生，让他去吧，我将来有的是法子把他带到法官面前，这点我绝不担心，但是这里还有这个家伙，”我说，“就是他在我从街上走过的时候，无缘无故把我抓住的。他抓住我以后对我的野蛮举动，你也是亲眼看到的。请你把他抓住，送他到法官那里去。”

“是的，太太，”那警察说道，一面转过身来向那汉子说道，“来，年轻人，你该和我们一块儿走，我希望你不是警察所不能管的，虽然警察管不了你的老板。”

那汉子就像当场被捉获的一个小偷，退缩着，看看他的老板，好像他能帮助他似的。那老板活像一个傻子，劝他动粗，他真的和那警察抵抗起来。当警察伸手抓他的时候，他猛地将警察推开，警察趁势把他打倒在地上。那家店立刻挤满了人，警察就把老板，那个汉子和全店的伙计统统抓了起来。

这个吵闹的结果是他们捉住的真贼，那个女人，乘机夹在人群中逃跑了，还有两个被他们拘留在店里的也不见了。他们到底犯罪了没有，我就不得而知了。

这时候，有几位在场的邻居，看到这种情况，就劝这绸缎商明白一些，他于是承认了错误。所以最后我们很平静地到法官那里去，有将近五百名群众跟在我们后面。一路上老听到人们问这是怎么回事，别人就说，一个绸缎商把一位太太错认成贼，将她捉住，后来又捉到真贼，现在那位太太抓住这绸缎商，把他带到法庭去。这件事特别使人感到兴趣，群众也越来越多，他们边走边喊：“哪个是那流氓？哪个是绸缎商？”尤其是女人喊得更厉害。当群众看到他时，他们叫道：“就是他，就是他。”时时有一团泥扔到他脸上。我们这样走了很久，最后绸缎商想起该请警察叫一辆马车，免得他受群众的侮辱。于是剩下的路，我们是坐马车走的。我们一共四个人：警察和我，绸缎商和他的伙计。

当我们来到法官面前的时候——他是布沦斯柏里地方的一位老绅士——警察先把这事的经过做了一个简单的报告，法官就命令我发言，说我所要说的话。开头他问我的姓名，我很不愿意告诉他，但是没有办法，只好告诉他我的名字叫玛丽·弗兰德斯，是一个寡妇，我的丈夫本是一个船主，在向弗吉尼亚航行的途中死去了。此外我又告诉了他一些使他无法对证的情况：我现在在城里和某人——指我的保姆——同住；但是我预备到美国去，我丈夫的财产都在那儿，我那天正去买些衣裳，打算换第二年的丧服，但是还没有走到任何店铺里去，那个汉子——绸缎商的伙计——就气势汹汹地向我冲来，把我吓坏了。他把我带到他老板的店里，虽然那老板承认我不是那个贼，他却不肯释放我，还叫来警察守着我。

然后我继续说到那个伙计怎样对待我，他们如何不许我找我的朋友们来。他们后来又怎样发现了真贼，从她身上找出他们丢失的货物以及前面说过的一切细节。

然后那个警察说了经过，他怎样劝绸缎商释放我，后来他命令伙计跟他走的时候，那伙计怎样拒绝他，他的老板怎样鼓动他，最后他如何打了警察以及其他这类的事，我在前面已经说过了。

最后法官听绸缎商和他的伙计讲情况。绸缎商的确滔滔不绝地说了一大篇关于扒手和小偷天天偷窃他们的事。当然他们是很容易弄错的，他们一发现弄错了，就把我释放了等等的话，这在前面已经说过了。至于那个伙计，他却没有什么话说，但是他借口说有一个伙计告诉他我的确是那个女贼。

总而言之，法官首先很客气地宣布释放我，绸缎商的伙计追贼追糊涂了，把一个无罪的人当作犯人，他对这事感到很抱歉。假使绸缎商后来没有这么无理，扣留我，他相信我会宽恕他们的，至于判给我多少赔偿，那是超乎他的权限之外的，他只能公开地责备他们，但是他想我一定会按照法律所规定的办法去做。他暂时叫他具结。

至于那伙计所犯的破坏治安罪，他告诉我，这点他一定使我满意。他将把他送到新门监狱去，因为他袭击了警察，又袭击了我。

于是他以袭击罪把那汉子送到新门监狱，他的老板交了保释金，我们就走了。但是我很高兴，看到群众等在那里，他们一出来，就大声呼喊，朝他们坐的马车扔石子和泥块。我就回我的保姆家了。

这场纷乱过去了，我回家把这段故事告诉我的保姆，她大笑起来。

“你为什么这样高兴？”我说，“这段故事并不像你所想的那么可笑。我敢说跟这些流氓在一起，真把我吓坏了。”“我笑！”我的保姆说道，“我大笑，孩子，因为我觉得你太幸运了。哼，假使你处理得法，这宗生意是你一生中所遇到的最好的生意。我向你担保，”她说，“你能够叫绸缎商给你五百金镑的赔偿费，此外从那个伙计的身上你还可以得到一些。”

关于这件事，我抱着和她不同的看法，尤其是我向法官说出了我的姓名。我知道我的名字是各处监狱的狱吏所熟悉的，假使这个案子公开审判起来，把我的姓名加以考查，法庭一定不会判决对这样一个人的名誉作任何赔偿的。然而，我不得不正式起诉，于是我的保姆替我找了一位很有名望的人来办这件事。这人是一位很能干，声誉甚好的律师。她这样做的确是对的，因为假使她雇用一个很平常的律师或者一个不出名的人，那么我一定得不到什么大好处。

我见到了这位律师，详细地告诉他我上面说过的一切情形。他告诉我，他相信陪审官对于这个案子会判定很厚的罚金，所以他了解了全部的情况之后，就开始起诉，绸缎商被拘留后，就缴了保释金出来。几天之后他和他的律师来找我的律师，说他愿意私下了结这件事，说这是一时的气盛所致。他说当事人——指我——很是尖酸刻薄，跟他们捣乱，辱骂他们，嘲笑他们，甚至当他们确实认为我是那个小偷的时候，我还向他们挑战等等这类的话。

我的律师也替我说得很好，让他们相信我是个有钱的寡妇。我会自己出气的，有许多朋友肯帮我的忙，他们全都劝我上诉到底。即使花上一千金镑，我也不在乎，因为我所受的侮辱是无法忍受的。

然而，他们却使我的律师答应不怂恿我坚持下去。如果我愿意和解，他不要阻止我，劝我应该采取和平手段，而不必用法律解决。他们还告诉他绝不会让他吃亏。这些话他全都很诚实地对我说了，还说假使他们向他行贿，他一定会告诉我。总而言之，他劝我跟他们妥协，因为他们非常害怕，非常希望妥协，因此出任何代价都在所不惜。他相信他们所给的代价比任何陪审官所判定的都要高。我问他们大概肯出多少。他对我说现在他还不知道，但是下次他一定会告诉我。过了不久，他们又来找他探问和我商谈的情况。他告诉他们谈过了，看出我并不像我的一些朋友那么反对和解，那些朋友愤恨我所受的耻辱，教唆我控告他。他们暗地里火上加油，鼓动我报复，或像他们所说的替自己打抱不平，所以他不能说出十分肯定的话。他说他将尽力劝我，但是他必须告诉我他们打算怎样办。他们托词说还没有什么主意，因为他们怕我也许会利用他们的主意来加害于他们。他告诉他们，他也同样不能出主意，因为他们也许会利用他的主意来减轻陪审官所定的罚金。然而，讨论了一会儿，彼此答应了将来不利用这次或者将来任何一次所交涉的结果，于是他们达成协议。可是彼此的意见相差很远，真不能希望有什么结果。我的律师要五百金镑的赔偿费，此外还要其他的费用，他们只肯出五十金镑，此外什么也没有。他们就这样分手了，绸缎商提议和我自己会面。我的律师欣然同意了。

我的律师劝我这次谈判的时候，要穿好衣服，还要摆些架子。绸缎商因此可以看出我是个贵妇人，那次他们抓着我的时候，我凑巧穿了一套朴素的衣服，所以只像个普通的女人。我于是穿了一套新缝的第二年的寡妇丧服，跟我在法庭上所说的一样。我在寡妇的服装所许可的范围内又极力打扮得十分华丽，我的保姆给我挂上一串值钱的珍珠项圈，后面用钻石小锁封了口，这原是人家当给她的东西。我身上还挂了一只很好的金表。总之，我显得很有身份。等到我知道他们到了的时候，才带着一个女仆坐马车到门口。

当我走进那房子的时候，绸缎商显出惊讶的神气。他站起来，向我鞠躬，我稍微——只是稍微，看了看他，然后走到我的律师指定我坐的地方坐下。我们是在他家里会面。过了一会儿，绸缎商说他认不出我了，开始说些恭维的话。我对他说，我相信第一次他就不知道我是什么人，否则，我敢说他不至于那样待我。

他告诉我他对于以往的事情觉得很抱歉，他订这次约会就是为了要表明他很愿意尽一切可能来进行和解。他希望我不要走极端，那不仅对于他个人是极大的损失，而且会使他的生意和店铺趋于毁灭。如果这样，我虽然对别人的伤害给予了十倍的报复而感到快意，可是却得不到任何好处。现在他愿意给我他所能给的任何赔偿，而免得他自己或者我去担受诉讼的麻烦。

我告诉他，我听他说话比上次通情达理，感到很高兴。的确，多数的无理举动，只要认罪就可算作足够的赔偿了。但是这次的无礼举动实在太过分了，不能这样了事。我并不是爱报复，也不是想把他或者其他任何人置于死地，而是因为我的朋友们一致反对我不顾自己的声名，得不到什么赔偿就这样草草了事。被人家当成贼，这是多么大的侮辱，所以我绝不能随便放过去。凡是知道我身份的人都不至于这样待我，但是因为我是个寡妇，我很久都没有注意到自己的装束，所以才会被人看成贼。至于后来他怎样对待我，我又说了一遍，但是这太使我生气了，我竟不耐烦再重述了。

他承认了一切，态度的确很谦恭。他提出很优厚的赔偿。他增加到一百金镑，一切诉讼费都由他出，他还说他将送我一套很贵重的衣服。我落到三百金镑，但我仍坚持要把详细情形在报纸上登一段启事。

这个条件是他绝不能同意的。然而，靠着我的律师的巧妙手段，他最后加到一百五十金镑和一套黑色的绸衣服。我同意了。不过好像是因为我的律师的请求才答应的，他替我还了律师的手续费，此外还请我们吃了一顿精美的晚餐。

我来拿钱的时候，带着我的保姆同来。她打扮得像个老公爵夫人，还带着一位衣着华丽的绅士，假装是向我求婚的，我却叫他表兄。那位律师偷偷地向绸缎商吐露这位绅士向我求婚的意思。

他的确很慷慨地款待了我们一番，高高兴兴地付了赔款。这样他一共花了二百金镑，也许还多些。在我们前一次相会，把一切事情谈妥的时候，就谈到那个伙计。绸缎商尽力地替他求情，告诉我他从前自己也开着一个店铺，生意很好，有一个妻子和几个孩子。可是现在他很穷，没有什么可以赔偿我，只能跪着求我原谅。我并没有跟那个无耻的流氓生气，他向我屈服对我也没有什么好处，因为我从他身上也得不到什么，所以我想还是慷慨地送这份人情吧。我于是告诉他我并不想置谁于死地，所以听到他的请求就宽恕了那个可怜虫。报仇的事，我是不屑于做的。

我们吃晚餐的时候，他带着那个汉子进来认罪，这个伙计从前既能盛气凌人地欺侮我，这时也能卑鄙谦恭地向我赔不是。在这一点上他是个无耻之徒的典范。当他占了优势，得意的时候，就横暴，残忍无情；被压倒的时候，就沮丧，意志消沉。可是，我止住了他那种卑躬屈节的神气，告诉他我饶恕了他，请他走开，好像我不大愿意见他，虽然我已经饶恕了他。

假使我能够这时洗手不干的话，那么我现在所处的环境实在太好了，我的保姆常说我是英国干这类生意的人们当中最富的一个。我也相信这话是真的，因为我身边有七百金镑的现款，此外还有衣服，戒指，一些金银器皿，两只金表，这些全是偷来的，因为除了我所说过的以外，我还做了无数次的生意。唉！假使我那时有忏悔之意，我还能够想想我过去的罪恶行为，做些好事来补偿我的罪恶。但是为了我所干的妨碍公众的事情，我该有叫公众快意的一天，那日子却还在后头。我忍不住仍要外出——我现在把做那项生意叫作外出——正如我穷困的时候，饥饿逼着我出去外找面包一样。

我和绸缎商这件事了结之后不久，我穿了一套和以前完全不同的行装，走了出去。我把自己打扮成一个讨饭的女人，穿上我所能找到的最难看、最肮脏的衣服，向我走近的各个门户和窗口偷看细察。我现在这种打扮，我感到行动起来比穿任何衣服都更不自如。我天生厌恶肮脏同褴褛的衣服，我自小养成干净整齐的习惯，无论处在什么样的环境，我总是爱干净。所以这是我历次化装中最使我局促的一次。我立刻心里想，这样不行，因为这是人人都讨厌和害怕的衣服。我想人人看见我，都怕我会走近他们，偷他们的东西，或者怕走近我，被我染上什么毛病似的。我第一次出去，游荡了整个晚上，没有丝毫结果，回家时又湿、又脏、又疲倦。然而，第二天晚上我又出去，那回我遇到一个小生意，几乎使我吃了大亏。我正站在一家酒店门口，来了一位骑马的绅士，在门口下了马，要到酒店里去，就叫一位伙计替他拉马。他在里面待了很久，伙计听到老板的呼唤，怕他生气，看我站在一旁，就叫我道：“这儿来，女人，拉一会儿这匹马，让我进去一下。那位先生出来，他会给你钱的。”“好吧，”我说，于是拉着那匹马，很镇静地走了，一直把它拉到我保姆家里。

对于内行人这的确是一宗好赃物，但是一个贼偷来了东西却不知怎样处理，就实在可怜了。因为当我到家的时候，我的保姆非常着急，怎样处理这个畜生呢，我们两人都不知道。把它寄在马厩里是不行的，因为报纸上必定会登布告，描写那匹马的形色，那么我们就不敢取回来了。

补救这个不幸的冒险唯一的办法就是去把这匹马放在一家旅馆里，叫个脚夫送信到那家酒店，说那位先生在某时不见的那匹马放在某某旅馆里，原主可以到那里去领。那个看马的可怜女人把它带到街上，却不能拉它回去，就把它留在那里了。我们原可以等到原主公布出来，出一个赏格，但是我们不敢冒险去领赏。

所以这可以说是偷窃，也可以说不是偷窃，因为别人没有失去什么，我也没有得到什么，我真不愿再穿着叫花子的衣服外出了。因为那是毫无用处的，而且我想这种打扮也是极其不祥的。

当我扮作乞丐的时候，我遇到了一群从来没有见过的流氓，我也看出他们的一些行径。他们是做假币的人，他们向我提出非常有利的条件与我合伙儿，但是他们要我干的却是最危险的事情。我指的是他们让我专管币模，假使我被人抓住，一定会处死刑，在火柱上受刑——我说的是在火柱上活活烧死。所以虽然我外表看起来只是个叫花子，假使我肯干的话，他们却答应我会得到金山银山，可是我不愿加入。说真的，假如我真是一个叫花子，或者像我开头时那样走投无路，我也许会同意。不知道如何活下去的人怎么会怕死呢？但是现在我的情形不是这样了，至少我是不肯冒这么可怕的危险的。而且，一想到在火柱上被烧死，我的心就害怕，我浑身发冷，我每一想到那种死法就浑身战栗。

从此我也就不这样打扮了，因为我虽不赞成这个提议，却没有明白地告诉他们，只装作喜欢这件事，答应再和他们见面。但是我不敢再和他们见面，因为假使我见到他们，又不肯答应，虽然我拒绝他们的时候极力担保替他们保守秘密，他们也得把我杀死，为的是弄得安稳些，使他们自己安心。这究竟是怎样的一种安心，只有为着避免危险，随意杀人的人才知道得最清楚。

这宗生意和偷马的活儿都是对我极不相宜的，我很容易下决心不再做这些事。我的专长好像在另一方面，虽然这里面也有不少的危险，可是对我更合适些，我也更有技巧。假使事情败露的话，我也更有脱身的机会。

那时又有好几帮人向我提议，要我加入一群入室打劫的强盗，但是我既不肯干造假币的勾当，也不愿冒这种危险。我愿意和两个男人同一个女人合伙，他们的办法是用些诡计进到人家屋里去，我很愿意跟他们一起冒险。但是他们已经有三个人了，他们又不想分开，我也不高兴一帮里有许多人，所以我就没有同他们合作，而他们第二次冒险就吃了一个大亏。

但是最后我遇到一个女人，她常常告诉我她在河边干些什么勾当，如何成功等等，我就和她合伙，我们弄得都还不错。有一天我们在圣卡萨琳街看见几个荷兰人，我们就托词要到他们店里买私运上岸的货物。我到一家店里去了两三次，在那里我们瞧见许多禁货，我的伙伴有一回带走了三块黑色荷兰绸，后来卖了不少钱，我也分了一份。但是我独自去了好几趟，却没有机会拿到什么，于是我就放开不干了。因为我去得那么勤，他们开始有些怀疑我。

这使我感到有些不愉快，我决定向别的方面去发展，因为这么久老是毫无所得地回来，我是不习惯的。于是我第二天打扮得很讲究，到城里另一头去散步。在特斯朗街我穿过交易所，但是并没有打算在那里找些什么东西。忽然间我看见那地方混乱一片，所有的人，店里伙计和其他的人，都站起来睁着眼看。那是因为某一位大公爵夫人到交易所来了，他们说皇后也快来了。我就走近一家店门口，我的背朝着柜台，好像是让群众走过似的。我的眼睛却盯着一包花边，那是店伙拿出来给站在我身旁的太太们看的，可是店伙和她的女仆都很专心地看谁来了，她们走进哪一家店铺，我扒了一纸包的花边放到袋子里，就逃走了。所以这位卖花边的女店伙由于张着嘴看公爵夫人而付出了很高的代价。

我离开那家店铺，好像是被人群挤走的，我夹在群众当中，从交易所的另一个门出去，在他们还没有发现失掉花边的时候，我已经离开了。因为我怕有人来追赶，就雇了一辆马车，把自己关在里面。我一把马车门关好，就看见花边商的女仆同五六个人跑到街心，大声喊叫，好像他们给什么东西吓住了似的。他们并没有喊“站住，小偷！”因为没有人跑掉，但是我却听见两三次有人喊着“抢了”“花边”等等，而那个女店伙也像吓呆了似的，跑来跑去地张望着。我雇的那个马车夫刚踏上座位，还没坐好，马还没有走动起来，因为我感到非常不安，于是我拿了那包花边，预备好从车窗扔下去，车窗在我的前面，刚好在车夫的背后。但是不到一分钟，车子就走动了，我不禁大喜，那就是说，车夫坐稳，给马加了一鞭，车子就走了，我也带回那赃物，大约值二十金镑。

第二天我又打扮起来，但是穿的和前天大不相同，又往那条路走去，但是没有碰到什么，等到我走进圣·杰姆士公园的时候，我看见许多时髦的上流女子，在树荫路散步，其中有一位十二三岁的小姑娘和一个大约九岁的小姑娘，我想大概是姐妹。我瞧见大的那个身上挂了一只美丽的金表同一串夺目的珍珠项圈，有一个穿着号衣的男仆人照应着她们。但是通常仆人都不跟着小姐走进树荫路的，所以我看见那个仆人阻止她们到树荫路去。大的那位小姐对他说话，我看出大概是叫他在那儿等着她们。

当我听到她打发了这个仆人之后，我就凑上一步，问他这位小姐是谁，还同他闲谈了一会儿，说和她一起的那个小孩多么好看以及那个大的女孩将来会变得多么温雅端庄，多么娇柔贞静。这个傻汉子立刻告诉我她是什么人。说她是爱色克斯郡托玛斯爵士的长女。她拥有很多的财产，她母亲这时还没有到城里来，她却和威廉爵士的夫人同住在沙福克街她的家里。还说了许多别的话，说除了托马斯爵士的马车，马车夫同他自己之外，她们还有一个女仆同一个女人伺候她们。那女人是全家的总管，不论在这里还是在家里都是一样。总之，他告诉我许多事，足够我利用来做我的生意。

我穿得也很讲究，和这小姐一样我也有金表。我离开那仆人，等到这小姐在树荫路转了两圈，又往前走的时候，我就跑到这位小姐的身旁。我叫她的名字向她问好，称她做蓓蒂小姐。我问她什么时候得到她父亲的信，她母亲什么时候到城里来，她现在好不好。

我和她这么熟识地谈她全家的人，她不能不相信我是和他们很熟的。我问她为什么不同柴姆太太（那是她保姆的名字）一齐出来，让这位太太去照顾她的妹妹朱狄司小姐。然后我跟她谈了一大阵关于她的妹妹的话，说是多么美丽的一位小姑娘，问她有没有念法文以及许许多多这类的话，她听了高兴。忽然间我们看见御林军来了，群众都跑去看皇帝向议院走去。

两位小姐都跑到树荫路的旁边，我扶着那位大小姐踏在路旁的木架边上，那么她就高得可以瞧见了。我又抱着二小姐，把她举得很高。那时候，我设法把那只金表轻轻地从蓓蒂小姐身上取下来，一直等到群众全走开了，她夹杂在树荫路中其他太太们当中的时候，她才发现表丢了。

我在人群里向她告别，对她说道：“亲爱的蓓蒂小姐，当心你的小妹妹。”群众好像挤得我离开了她，我也迫不得已地跟她告别了。

皇帝一走过去，这种混乱状况立刻就停止了，地方也立刻清净了。但是皇帝走过的时候，总有一大群人跟在后面跑，所以我在离开那两位小姐，毫无破绽地偷了她们的东西之后，就和群众一块儿往前跑下去，好像我赶着要去瞧皇帝似的。于是我在群众的前头，一直跑到树荫路的尽头，那时皇帝向近卫骑兵走去，我就转入一条通到草市末端的街道，在那里雇了一辆马车逃跑了。我承认我没有践约，那就是说我没有去找蓓蒂小姐。

我曾经想冒个险，同蓓蒂小姐留在一起，等她发现丢失了表，我可以同她一样地大喊特喊，把她送上马车，我自己也陪她坐在车上，送她回家。因为她既然这么喜欢我，完全被我欺骗了，竟把她的亲戚和家里人的情况全告诉了我，我想再进一步是很容易的，最少也可以把她那串珍珠项圈弄到手。但是我想到那小孩子也许不会怀疑我，别人却会怀疑我的。假使有人搜查我，我就会被发觉，因此我想还是带着这只金表逃跑的好。

我后来偶然听说，那位小姐发现丢失了表，她在公园里大喊起来，叫她的仆人到处去找我，她把我的形状描述得非常清楚，他立刻知道就是站着和他谈了许久，问了他许多关于她们的情况的那个女人。但是在她走近她的仆人，把全部经过告诉他之前，我已走到他们赶不上的地方了。

此后我干了一种别的生意，那是跟我历来所做的很不相同的，是在康汉特园附近的一家赌博场里。

我看见好些人来来去去。我在路上同另外一个女伴站了许久，瞧见一位好像和普通人不同的绅士走了进去，我就向他说：“先生，他们也让女人进去吗？”

“是的，太太，”他说，“假使她们高兴的话，还可以加入赌博。”

“我倒想去一下，”我说。他说，假使我想去的话他愿意介绍。我于是跟着他到门口，他往里面瞧了一下，说道：“太太，这里面都是赌钱的人，假如你打算试一试，可以进去。”我向里面望了望，大声对我的女伴说：“里面全是男人，我不想冒险到男人里面去。”听到这句话，里面一位先生喊道：“太太，你用不着害怕，我们这里全是公平讲理的人，我们很欢迎你来，随你下多少注。”我于是走近一些，在旁边看着，有人拿一把椅子给我坐，我坐下看骰子在盘子里迅速地转动着，然后我对我的女伴说：“先生们赌得太大，对我们不相宜，我们走吧。”

那里的人都非常客气，尤其是有一位先生鼓励我说：“来，太太，假使你肯试一试，假使你敢相信我，我愿向你担保你在这里绝不会受骗。”

“是的，先生，”我微笑说，“我想你们不至于欺骗一个女人。”但是我仍然不肯尝试，虽然我拿出了装钱的一个钱袋，为的是要他们看看我并不是没有钱。

我坐了一会儿之后，一位先生开玩笑地对我说：“来，太太，我看你不敢自己冒险。我同太太们搭伙赌钱时总是运气很好，如果你自己不愿下注的话，你替我下注吧。”我告诉他：“先生，我很不愿意输去你的钱，”我又说，“虽然我的运气都还不坏，可是先生们赌得这么大，我真不敢拿自己的钱去冒险。”

“好，好，”他说，“这是十个金币，太太，你替我下注吧。”我就拿着他的钱下了注，他自己在旁边看着。我每回输一个金币或者两个金币，这样就输去了九个金币，那时骰子的盘子轮到坐在我身旁的人，这位先生又给我十个金币，叫我一下子压五个金币，那位拿着骰子的盘子的先生一掷就输，于是他又赢了五个金币，他因此胆子大了，叫我拿那盘子，这是个很大的冒险。可是，我连掷连胜，那个盘子拿得这么久，我把他所有的本钱全赢回来了，我膝上还有满把的金币。最运气的是，当我掷输的时候，下注的人只有一两个胜过我，所以我放下盘子的时候，并没有吃大亏。

当我做到这种地步的时候，我把所有的钱都交给这位先生，因为这都是他的。我要他自己来赌，托词是我不大懂得这种赌博。他大笑说，只要我运气好，懂不懂是不相干的，还请我不要离开。可是他拿出他起先放下去的十五个金币，叫我用其余的去赌。我要把剩下来的数一数，看我到底赢了多少，但是他说：“不，不，不要数，我相信你是很老实的，数钱会弄坏运气的。”于是我继续赌下去。

我很懂得这种赌博，虽然我假说不大懂。我赌得非常小心，我耍把戏也耍得很谨慎，我的法子是留一大堆金币在我膝上，不时偷些放到我袋里去，但是干得非常巧妙，乘着那么合适的时候才偷，我敢说他是看不出的。

我替他赌了很久，运气非常好。但是最后一回我拿那盘子的时候，他们向我下了一个大注，我就大胆地掷骰子。我老是继续拿着那盘子，差不多赢了八十金镑，不过最后一次掷骰子，却输掉了一大半。因为我恐怕把全部的钱又输还给他们，于是我站起来，对他说：“请你来吧，先生，请你把这些钱拿去自己赌吧。我想我替你赌得并不算坏。”他仍然要我再赌下去，但是时间已经不早了，我很想回去。当我把钱给他的时候，我对他说我希望他肯让我数一数，那么我可以知道我赢了多少，替他赌的成绩到底多么大。我数的结果是六十三个金币。“呀，”我说，“假使没有那次不幸的失败，我会替你赢到一百个金币。”说着我就把全部的钱交给他，但是他不肯收，一定要我伸手拿一部分，请我随意取多少。我不肯拿，我坚决表示我不愿自己去拿。假使他真想给我的话，那么由他自己决定吧。

其余的几位先生看见我们推让，便喊道：“都拿给她吧。”可是我绝对不肯要。然后，他们里面有一个说道：“你该死，杰克，你应当和她对分。你不知道吗，和太太们一块儿你总得公平。”总之，他和我均分，我带走了三十个金币，此外我私下偷来的还有四十三个金币，后来我觉得很后悔，我不该偷他的钱，因为他实在太慷慨了。

于是我带回了七十三个金币，让我的老保姆看看我赌钱的运气有多么好。然而，她却劝我不要再去冒险，我听了她的忠告，就不再到那儿去。因为我和她一样明白，如果我赌上瘾了，我会失去这些钱和我所有的存款。

幸运这样照耀着我，我弄了这么多钱，我的保姆因为总是分享我一部分的赃物，也有了这么多钱。这个老妇人就认真地谈起我们洗手不干的事，因为，我们既然还是平安无事，就满足于我们已经得到的东西吧。但是我不知道什么命运之神指导着我，我现在不愿收盘，正如以前我向她提起这事时她不愿收盘一样。所以不幸得很，我们暂时又打消了这个念头。总之，我比以前更心狠，更大胆，我的成功居然使我比任何小偷都更有名。

我有时居然敢把同样的把戏耍上两回，这是不合这个行业的规矩的。可是我也没有失败过。不过每回我出去，我总换一种模样，做出新的姿态来。

这时是一年里最热闹的时候，先生们多半都不在城里，坦布立治，厄普孙和其他这类的地方却满是人。城里既然人少了，我想我们这行生意和别的生意一样也受到了一些影响。所以在年底我就和一帮小偷合了伙，他们每年都到坦布立治市集，从那里又到萨福克郡的柏立市集去。我们预料在那里可以得到很大的好处，但是当我看到实际情形时，我立刻感到厌倦。因为除了扒别人的口袋外，没有什么值得下手的。就是得了一件赃物，也不像在伦敦那样容易带走，做我们这类生意的机会也不像伦敦那样多。一路上我只是在柏立市集得到一块金表，在剑桥得到一小包麻布，而那包东西却弄得我不得不离开那里。我用的是老法子，我想用之于乡下开店铺的人是可以的，虽然在伦敦城里也许不行。

我没在市集上，却在剑桥城里一家布店里买了将近七金镑的上等荷兰绒和别的东西。我买完了，就吩咐把它们送到某家旅馆里，那天早上我故意在那里订了一个房间，好像打算在那里过夜似的。

我叫那布商在什么时候把东西送到我所住的旅馆，那时我就可以给他钱。在约定的时间，布商把东西送来，我就安置我的一个同党在房门口。当旅馆女仆把这送东西的人（他是个年轻的学徒，差不多是个大人了）带到门口的时候，我的同党就告诉他，她的女主人还在睡觉，假使他把东西留下，过一点钟再来，女主人醒了，他就可以拿到钱。他很爽快地留下那个小包，就走了，差不多半点钟之后，我的女仆和我也走了。就在那天晚上我雇了一匹马，一个男人骑在我的前面，到新市去，从那里坐了辆不太拥挤的公共马车往圣爱德曼的柏利出发。在那里，我已经说过了，我只有一点生意，在一个乡村小歌舞剧院里从一位太太身旁抽去一只金表，当时她不单是高兴得忘乎所以，而且我想还有些喝醉了，因此我干得很顺手。

我带着这件小小的赃物到伊布斯威治去，从那儿又到了哈里奇。我走进一家客栈，仿佛是刚从荷兰来，我深信在那些从这里上岸的外国人中间总会碰到些买卖。但是我看出他们身上多半没有什么值钱的东西。在他们的皮箱和荷兰式网篮里面倒有些东西，但是这些东西又老有他们的仆人守着。然而，一天晚上，我居然把一只皮箱从那位先生睡的房间里运出，那时仆人在自己的床上睡得很熟，我想他大概是喝醉了。

我正住在这位荷兰人的隔壁，把这沉重的东西费了大力气搬到我的房间之后，我就走到街上去，看看能不能带着这个东西逃走。我走了很久，但是看不出有什么办法把这皮箱运走，或者把里面的货物拿走。因为那个城很小，我对那地方又很生疏。所以我回来时决心把它送回，放在原来的地方。正在那个时候，我听见一个汉子向另一个汉子说话，催他快点，因为船要开了，潮要退了。我向那汉子问道：“先生，你那个船是什么船？”

“到伊布斯威治去的小艇，太太。”他说。

“什么时候开船？”

“现在，”他说，“太太，你想到那里去吗？”

“是的，”我说，“如果你们等我把东西拿来的话。”

“你的东西放在哪里，太太？”他问道。

“在一家客栈里。”我说。

“好吧，我跟你去，太太，”他很客气地说，“替你把东西拿来。”

“好吧。”我说着就带他走了。

客栈里的伙计们正在大忙特忙：从荷兰来的邮船刚进港口，两辆公共马车载着乘客刚从伦敦来，这些乘客还要赶乘另一只邮船到荷兰去，这两辆公共马车也要在第二天带着刚上岸的旅客回去。在这种应接不暇的时刻，我亲自跑到柜上，付了店钱，告诉女掌柜我在一艘小艇上已经订好了舱位。

这种小艇很宽敞，设备也很好，专从哈里奇送乘客到伦敦去。虽然这种船的名字叫“小艇”（这本来是泰晤士河里一两个人驾的小船），可是能够载二十个乘客同十至十五吨的货物，而且宜于海行。这些都是我前天晚上打听到伦敦去的办法时得知的。

女掌柜非常客气，刚一拿到我付的账，立刻被人们叫开了，因为整个客栈都忙极了。于是我离开她，把那个汉子引到我房里，把那皮箱（或者可以说是衣箱，因为这很像个衣箱）交给他，用一条旧的围裙包着，他立刻背着这个箱子到船上去，我跟在他后面，没有一个人问过我们。至于那个喝醉的荷兰仆人，他仍然睡在那里，他的主人在同其他外国人一起吃晚饭，非常高兴。我于是安安稳稳地把它带到伊布斯威治去了。因为是夜里出发，客栈里的人都不知道，只晓得我是乘哈里奇小艇到伦敦去的，因为我对女掌柜是这样说的。

在伊布斯威治海关人员来麻烦我，他们扣住那个衣箱，要打开来检查。我对他们说，我可以让他们检查，但是钥匙在我丈夫身上，他从哈里奇来还没有到这儿。我之所以这样说，是因为假使检查的时候他们看出所有东西都是男人的，而不是女人的，也不会感到奇怪。他们一定要打开这衣箱，我就答应他们用强力打开，就是把锁扭断。这当然不是件难办的事。

他们找不出什么合乎口味的东西，因为这个衣箱已经检查过了，但是却发现了几件东西，我感觉十分满意。尤其是一小包法国金币和荷兰银圆，其余的多半是假发，衣服，剃刀，球形肥皂，香水和其他男人的日用品，这都算是我丈夫的，所以我没有什么嫌疑。

这时天刚破晓，四周还是黑洞洞的，我不知道走哪条路好。因为我预料早上一定有人来追我，或者把我捉住连东西一起带走，所以我决定采取新的措施。我大大方方地带着我所谓的衣箱到城里的一家客栈，把里面的东西拿出来，我想那空箱子是不值得注意的。然后，我将它交给客栈的女掌柜，托她好好地保管，等我回来再拿，说完我就上街去了。

当我走到城里离那客栈很远的地方，我碰到一位刚打开大门的老妇人，便和她谈起天来，问了她许多跟我的目的和计划毫不相干的事情。但是从我们的谈话中，我得知这个城市在什么地方。我现在是在一条通往赫得黎的街上，某条街通到水边，某条街通到城市的中心，最后还知道了某条街通到科尔切斯特，往伦敦去的大路正好在那里。

我很快和这个老妇人结束了谈话，因为我只想知道哪条路是往伦敦去的。我立刻尽快地往前走，这并不是因为我有意步行到伦敦或者科尔切斯特去，而是因为我想悄悄地离开伊布斯威治。

我走了两三里路，忽然遇到一个老实的乡下人，他正忙着干些庄稼活儿。我不知道怎么说好，先问他许多不相干的话，最后才告诉他我要到伦敦去。公共马车坐满了人，我占不到位子，问他能不能告诉我到哪里雇一匹可以骑两个人的马和一个诚实的人与我并骑到科尔切斯特去，好在那里搭公共马车。这个老实的乡下佬仔细瞧了瞧我，有好半天没说一句话，然后，他搔着头皮说：“雇匹马，你说，到科尔切斯特去，骑两个人？哦，是的，太太，你肯出钱自然有马。”

“朋友，”我说，“我想这是自然的事，我并不想白骑马。”

“那么，可是，太太，”他说，“你愿意出多少钱呢？”

“不，”我说，“朋友，我不知道你们这里是什么价钱，因为我是一个陌生人。但是假使你能替我找一匹马，尽量替我找一匹价钱最便宜的马，我会给你钱的，不会叫你白辛苦的。”

“唉，这话讲得真诚实。”那乡下人说。

“其实并不诚实，”我心里想，“如果你了解全部情况的话。”

“啊，太太，”他说，“我有一匹可以骑两个人的马，就是我自己送你去也不要紧。”

“你肯去吗？”我说，“好，我相信你是一个诚实人。如果你肯去，我很高兴。我会给你合理的报酬。”

“哎呀，你看，太太，”他说，“我也不向你要不合理的价钱！假使我送你到科尔切斯特，我和我的马得要你五个先令，因为今天晚上我大概来不及回家了。”

总之，我雇了那个老实人和他的马。但是我们经过一个小城时，（我记不清它的名字，只记得它在河边，）我假装自己非常不舒服，不能再往前走了，假使他看我是个生人，肯陪我留下，我极愿多给他点钱，因为辛苦了他和他的马。

我这样做是因为我知道那些荷兰人和仆人一定在路上，不是坐公共马车，就是骑着驿马追赶我。我只怕那个醉汉或者其他在哈里奇看见过我的人又看到我，我想停留一天他们全会过去的。

我们整晚住在那里，第二天离开的时候也不算很早，所以我到科尔切斯特的时候已经快十点钟了。想起我从前在那里度过不少快乐日子的地方，的确是件很高兴的事。我到处打听那里的老朋友的消息，但是一点也没打听到。他们不是死了，就是搬走了。那几个年轻的姑娘全出嫁了，或者到伦敦去了。老绅士和我最早的恩人，那位老太太全去世了。最叫我痛心的是那个少爷，我第一个爱人，后来当我伯伯的那个人，也不在人间了。他留下两个儿子，都已经成年了，也都搬到伦敦去了。

到了这里以后，我辞退了我那位年老的乡下人，隐姓埋名地待了三四天，然后雇了一辆四轮马车回去，因为我不愿冒险坐哈里奇公共马车，怕被人瞧见。但是我用不着这么小心，因为在哈里奇除了那个站在门外的老妇人之外，没有一个人会认识我。就说她吧，她当时那么匆忙，又只看见过我一回，而且是在灯光下，恐怕也不会认出我来。

我现在回到伦敦来了。虽然最后一次的冒险，我挣了不少的东西，可是我不打算再到乡间去游荡了，即使我做这行生意一直到死，我也不会再到异乡去冒险了。我向我的保姆缕述我旅行的经过。她很喜欢哈里奇那桩生意，我们私下谈论着这些事情的时候，她说一个贼是专门趁人不备的，所以一个精细谨慎的人总会有许多机会，所以她想像我这样一个善于弄这勾当的人，无论走到哪里，总会得到一些赃物的。

从另一方面来说，假使好好地想一下我这故事中的每个细节，对于老实人是有用的，可以提醒各种人注意，防止同样的诡计，和生人打交道的时候，要处处留神才好，因为在他们面前总不免有一两个陷阱。我这全部历史的教训只好让读者凭着自己的眼光和判断去吸取吧，我是不配向他们说出的。让一个十分罪恶，十分可怜的人的经验进入读者们有用的教训的宝库吧。

我现在又要走进另一种新的生活境界了。长期的罪恶生活和无比的成功，使我的心硬了，我回来之后，并不想放下这个行业，即使照别人的榜样看来，这个行业的结局终归是苦痛和悲哀。

一个圣诞节的晚上，为了要在我这一大串的罪恶之上加上一件，我走了出去，看看有什么机会。当我走到福斯特巷里一家银匠铺子的时候，我的确看到了一个大好的机会，那是我这行人绝不能放过的。那铺子里并没有人，只有一堆零零碎碎的银器散放在窗边和一个人的座位上，我想他是在铺子里工作的。

我大胆地走进去，正要把手按在一件银器上，乘店里没人，安安稳稳地拿起来跑开的时候，对面人家一个好管闲事的人看见我进去，店里又没有人，就跑过街来，奔进那家铺子，也不问我干什么，我是谁，就抓住我，叫铺子里的人出来。

我还没拿到一件东西，一瞧见有人跑来，就急中生智，当那个男人把我抓住的时候，我立刻用脚拼命地跺着地板，也大声喊叫。

然而，我在最危险的时候，胆子也最大，所以那男人用手来捉我的时候，我却理直气壮地向他理论，说我是来买半打银匙的。我运气真好，这家作坊不单是替别家店铺打东西，而卖各种银器。那汉子听了这话大笑起来，满以为他替他邻居干了一件了不得的大事，所以他一定要说我不是来买东西，却是来偷东西的。他引来了一大群人。老板这时已经从邻近一个地方被叫回来了，我对他说，在这儿吵闹，在这儿谈论这件事，是没有用的。那个男人既然说我是来偷东西，他当然要拿出证据来，我想我们还是不说别的话，直接到法庭去算了。因为我已经看出我总不至于在那个抓住我的汉子面前失败。

那家铺子的老板和老板娘的确不像对面街上的那人那么野蛮。老板说道：“太太，你也许是怀着好心走进店里来的，但是当你看不见有人在这里的时候，你走进我这种铺子，那的确是件危险的事。我的邻居既对我这么殷勤，我要不承认他很有理由，就难免辜负他的好意。虽然，整个说来，我没有看出你想偷什么，我真不知道怎么办好。”我催他和我同到法官那里去，假使他能找出证据，证明我有偷窃的动机，那么我很愿意屈服，否则我希望得到赔偿。

我们正在这样辩论着，一群人聚集在门口，那位城里的参事会会员同治安官T．B．爵士也来了。他是银匠在听到这消息的时候，被请来判断这案子的。

说句公道话，这位银匠很实事求是地，平心静气地说出他所知道的一切。那个跑过来抓住我的人还是态度激烈，乱说一通，这对于我倒有利。然后轮到我说话了，我告诉这位大人，我在伦敦是个异乡人，才从北方来。我住在某地方，我走过这条街，走进这家银铺去买半打匙子。我运气真好，恰巧袋里有一个旧银匙，我就拿出来，告诉他我带这个银匙，是打算来配半打新的，好和我乡下本来有的那几个凑成一套。我一看见铺子里没人，就使劲地用脚跺地，为的是让人们听见，我还大声喊着。店里的确散放着许多零碎的银器，但是谁也不能说我碰过哪一件。当我喊铺子里面的人的时候，有个人从街上跑到铺子里，怒气冲冲地抓住了我。假使他真想替他的邻居帮忙，他应当远远地站着，悄悄地看我偷不偷东西，然后看我犯罪的时候突然捉住我。“这话是很对的。”城里的参事会会员先生说道，然后转过来问抓住我的那个人，我真用脚跺地没有。他说，是的，我的确用脚跺着地，但是这也许是因为知道他来了。“不，”那位先生打断他的话说，“现在你自相矛盾了，因为刚才你说她在店里时背朝着你，没有看见你，一直等到你来到她的面前。”我的背的确一半是朝着街的，但是我所做的事使我有眼观八方的必要，所以，像我前面所说的，我的确瞧见他跑过来，而他并没有瞧见。

参事先生听了我的全部报告之后，说出了他的意见，认为银匠的邻居错了，而我是无罪的。银匠同他的妻子也赞成这句话，就把我开释了。但是我刚要离开的时候，参事先生说：“等一等，太太，假使你想来买银匙，我希望你不要因为我朋友的一时过失，而使他失去一个主顾。”我立即说道：“不，先生，假使他能配我拿来做样子的这个银匙，我还是想照顾他的生意的。”于是银匠拿出几把式样完全相同的银匙给我看。他称了银匙的重量，共合三十五个先令，我掏出钱袋付他钱，我袋子里面有将近二十个金币，因为不管怎样我每回出去，身边总带着这么多钱，这对我很有用处。

参事先生看见我的钱的时候，他说：“啊，太太，现在我完全相信你是冤枉了，因为这种缘故，我才请你买那些银匙，看你买好了，我才走，如果你没钱买那些银匙，我倒怀疑你不是存心来买东西的，因为那些来偷东西的人袋里绝没有你那么多钱。”

我微笑了一下，对那位大人说，我之所以能够得到他的恩惠，主要还是因为我自己的钱，但是我希望他仍然坚持他起先所做的那种公平裁判。他说是的，他一定坚持，这样一来他的意见更坚决了，他现在完全相信我是冤枉了。这样我从一件几乎把我毁掉的案件之中安全地解脱出来。

这件事过去仅三天，我便继续做我的旧生意了，丝毫没有因为这件事而加以注意。我大胆地走进一家开着大门的人家，偷偷地把两匹所谓金银缎的艳丽绣花缎子藏在身上，因为我相信没有人瞧见。那不是一家绸缎铺，也不是绸缎栈，却好像是一个替织匠向绸缎铺批发货物的人住的地方，是一家买卖经理处。

把这个故事里这件罪恶的事实说得简单点吧，我被两个姑娘捉住了，正当我走出大门的时候她们张着口惊慌地向我跑来。一个把我拉进屋子，一个把大门关上。我想向她们说好话，但是丝毫没有求情的余地，就是两条毒蛇也不能比她们更凶了。她们扯破我的衣服，威吓着，大声嚷着，好像要把我杀死似的。然后这家的女主人来了，跟着男主人也来了，都非常凶暴。

我向那老板极力求情，告诉他大门开着，货物对于我是一种引诱，因为我是穷苦的人，贫困是许多人忍耐不了的。我流着眼泪求他可怜我。那家的老板娘被我说得感动了，愿意把我放走，她丈夫也差不多答应了，但是那两个无礼的姑娘已经跑出去，带了一个警察来（并没有人派她们去）。于是老板说他不能让我走，我必须去见法官，他对他的妻子说，如果把我放走，他也许会遇到麻烦。

一看见警察，我的确吓坏了，我想我大概是晕倒在地上了。我当时气绝，人们真以为我快死了，老板娘替我辩护，求她的丈夫，既然他们并没有损失什么，还是放我走吧。我向他提出愿意付那两块料子的钱，不管是什么价钱，虽然我并没有偷那两块料子。我还对他说，他既已保住了他的货物，实际什么也没有损失，又何必仅仅因为我想拿那些东西，就叫我流血。一定要将我置之死地呢？那就太残忍了。我请警察注意我并没有破门而入，也没有带什么东西出去。我来到法官面前的时候，又替自己辩护，说我既没有打破什么东西进屋去，也没有带什么东西出门来，于是法官就有意把我释放。是第一个拦住我的那个无礼的丫头说，我的确要带着东西出去，但是她拦住了我，把我拉进去。法官因此定了我的罪，把我带到了新门那个可怕的地方。一听到人们说起这个地方，我的血都凝固了。我有那么多同伴都曾经关在那里，并从那里走上了绞刑架。我母亲在那里曾经深深地受过苦，我也是在那里降生到世界上来的，在那里我除了可耻地死去之外没有别的办法得救。总而言之，那个地方早在等候我的光临，我费了那么多的心机，一直平平安安地躲避到现在。

我现在真是碰到了难关。当我才进去，看到那凄惨地方的一切可怕的情景时，心里的恐惧真是无法形容。我已把自己当成绝望的人了，没有别的可想，只想着走出世界，而且是极可耻地走出世界。那种地狱般的嘈杂，吵闹，诅咒，骚扰，臭气，龌龊以及我在那里所看到的一切使人触目惊心的东西使那地方好像成了地狱的象征，是通到地狱去的一道大门。

想起我所得到的各种暗示，想起从前自己的理性和良好的境遇，想起我逃脱的各种危险，想起我尚未失败时就该收场，我却阻止了这个念头，我的心硬了，丝毫不感到恐惧——想到这一切，我深深地痛恨自己。在我看来，好像有一个看不见、逃不脱的命运把我赶到这个悲惨的日子里来。现在我将在绞刑架上赎我一切的罪过。我现在将以我的血来满足法律的要求，现在我的生命和我的罪恶的末日同时来临了。这许多念头乱七八糟地倾泻进我的脑海里，使我不胜愁闷和失望。

然后我诚心诚意地忏悔我过去的一切，但是这种忏悔没有使我感到满意和安宁，不，一点也没有。因为，我想，这是作恶的能力已经被夺后的一种忏悔。我似乎不是为了过去的罪恶，为了得罪了上帝和我的邻人而悲伤，我所悲伤的却是害怕自己会因此受罚。我想，我所以忏悔，不是因为我曾经犯过罪，而是因为我现在正在受难，这就使我失去了一切忏悔所能给予的安慰。

我来到那不幸的地方之后，有几天几夜不能睡觉，有时我真想死在那里，虽然我对于死也没有慎重的考虑。真的，再没有什么地方比那更使我感到恐怖，再没有别的人比那里的伴侣更使我恶心。唉！假使把我送到世界上任何地方，而不是新门，我会感到多么幸运啊！

再说，比我先进去的那些狠心的可怜虫看到我会多么得意呀！怎么！弗兰德斯太太最后也到新门来了吗？啊！玛利太太，莫力太太，最后干脆地叫作荡妇弗兰德斯的也来了吗？她们说，她们都以为魔鬼帮助了我，所以我才能够神气了这么些年。她们在那里期待我已经很久了，最后我果然来了吗？然后，她们嘲笑我不该那么忧愁，欢迎我到那里来，希望我快乐起来，请我乐观些，不要垂头丧气，事情也许不像我所想象的那么坏。接着她们喊拿白兰地来，向我致贺，但是都算在我的账上，因为她们说我是才到这个大学来的（她们是这样叫那监狱的），她们相信我还有钱，而她们是没有的。

我问这群女人里的一个在这里待了多久。她说四个月。我问她，当她初进来的时候，对于这个地方是怎样的看法。“正同你现在一样，”她说，“很害怕，很恐惧。”她想她是到了地狱里了。“我现在还是这样想，”她说，“但是现在我对这地方已经很习惯了，我在这里面并不去自找麻烦。”

“我想，”我说，“你大概没有那种最后的危险吧？”

“不，”她说，“你猜错了，我已经被判处了死刑，不过我托词身上有孕，但是我和审判我的法官一样，根本没有怀孕。我想下次审判时，我又要判回原案了。”所谓“判回原案，”就是一个女人因为怀孕暂缓行刑，但是后来证明并没有怀孕，或者她的确怀孕，却已经生产了，再去受先前判的刑。

“哎呀，”我说，“你怎么能够这样无忧无虑呢？”

“嘿嘿，”她说，“我自己会高兴起来，这是没有办法的，而且发愁又有什么用呢？假使我被绞死，那么我结束了就是了”。说着她立刻跳起舞来，还一边唱着底下这首新门监狱歌：





假使我吊在绳子上摇摆，

我将听到教堂的钟声[4]，

可怜的珍妮就这么结束了。





我所以提到这件事，是因为想让此后遭到同样厄运，来到新门这个可怕地方的任何囚犯知道，一天一天过去的日子、无可奈何的心情以及和住在里面的可怜虫的来往会很容易地使他们习惯那个地方。最后他们会同起先他们最怕的东西妥协。他们在患难之中还能像没遇到患难时一样毫无廉耻地欢欣作乐。

可是，我不能像有些人那样，说这个魔鬼并不像人们所描写的那么可怕。因为的确没有颜色能够把那地方描绘给大家看。除了在里面受过难的人之外，谁也想象不到那地方是个什么样子。但是怎么会渐渐变得习惯地狱，而且不单能忍耐它，甚至还觉得有趣呢。这件事除了像我这种尝过其中滋味的人，别人是不知道的。

我被抓到新门去的那天晚上，我送个信给我的老保姆，她吓了一跳，这是你们可以想象得到的。那天晚上她心中感到的痛苦和关在新门里面的我是差不多的。

第二天早上她来看我，极力安慰我，但是她知道那是没有用的。然而，她说在困难中消沉下去就等于增加困难。她立刻努力想尽一切办法来防止我们所怕发生的结果。她首先去找到捉住我的那两个凶悍的姑娘。她暗暗地和她们商量，劝说她们，答应给她们钱，总之，用尽一切想得到的办法阻止她们控告。她愿意给其中的一个姑娘一百金镑，只要她离开她的女主人，不出庭告我。但是那姑娘很坚决，虽然她是个每年只挣三个金镑左右的女仆，可她却拒绝了。我的保姆相信，即使她愿意给她五百金镑，她也是会拒绝的。于是她又找到另外一个姑娘。这个姑娘表面看起来没有那么无情，有时还想发发慈悲，但是第一个姑娘控制住了她，简直不让我的保姆和她谈话，还威吓着要告发她企图掩盖证据。

于是我的保姆跑去见老板，就是货物被我偷去的那个人，和他的妻子。这个女人一开头就对我有些同情。她看到那个女人还是同情我，但是那个男人借口受法律的约束，不得不控告我，否则他会因为不出庭而受罚。

我的保姆说她能够找到朋友把他的名字除掉，那么他就不至于受连累了。但是她绝不能使他相信除了出庭控告我之外在世界上还能找得出别的妥善办法。所以一共有三个见证人来控告我——老板和他的两个女仆。那就是说，我非处死刑不可。除了死之外，我再也没有别的可想了。我实在找不到什么来作为痛苦的安慰，这我在前面已经说过了，因为我的一切忏悔在我看来不过是由于我怕死而产生的，并不是对于我过去的，使这个灾难降在我身上的那种罪恶生活的真诚追悔，或者因为得罪了现在忽然来做我的审判官的造物主而感到的真诚追悔。

在灵魂的极端恐怖之下，我在这里过了好些日子。好像有一个死神的影子出现在我的眼前，整天整夜不能想别的，只有绞索和绞架，魔鬼和凶恶的幽灵。我怕死，同时我的良心又责备我的那种可怖的生涯，我心里的烦恼，是无法形容的。

新门的牧师来找我，照例说些话，但是他老是劝我讲出我的罪恶（虽然他并不知道我犯的是什么罪），和盘托出从前一切的过失和这类的举动，不然的话，上帝一定不会赦免我。他说得这么不得要领，我从他身上绝没有得到任何安慰。而且看到这个可怜的家伙早上劝我坦白和忏悔，中午就喝白兰地喝到烂醉，这种行为使人作呕，我于是开始厌恶这个人，以后因为这个人的缘故，又渐渐地厌恶他的工作。于是我请他不要再来麻烦我。

不知道我这位勤勉的保姆做了怎样百折不回的努力，在第一次法庭开审的时候（我是指吉鲁荷鲁大审判的时候），居然没有人控告我。所以我又可以多活一个月或者五个星期，这段时间当然我要认为是上帝给我用来忏悔既往，预备将来的。一言以蔽之，我该看作是给我做忏悔用的时间，应当这样去用，但是我却不然。我还是和从前一样，只是因为我被抓到新门监狱里而感到伤心，我心里简直没有忏悔的念头。

相反地，却像山坳里的水，一滴到什么东西上面，就把那东西僵化了，化为石头，同样像我这样跟这些地狱里的狗来往对于我自然也发生了作用。我堕落得成为铁石心肠的人。我起初变得愚蠢和无知，然后变得野蛮和糊涂，最后我发狂得像她们中的任何人一样。简单说来，我变得很自然地喜欢那个地方，心里觉得很安逸，真好像我是在那里出生的。

人性居然能够堕落到那种程度，甚至在最悲惨的环境里还能感到快乐同舒适，那真是难以想象的。我想天下再没有比这个更坏的环境了：凡是像我这样有生命、有健康和金钱的人绝不会处在更苦痛的环境里了。

我有一个罪恶的重担压在身上，但凡有点反省能力的人．对于今生的快乐和来生的苦痛还有些顾虑的人，都会被这重担压倒下去。我起先的确有所反悔，但并不是忏悔，现在我连反悔都没有了。我得到了一个罪名，判处了死刑，证据确凿，我简直没有辩护的余地。我又背上积案重重这个名义，所以除了在几个星期内处死而外，我不能抱别的希望，我也绝没有脱逃的念头。然而我的心灵却莫名其妙地麻木起来。我心中没有烦恼，没有恐惧，没有悲哀，开头的那种惊奇已经过去了，我可以说我自己也莫名其妙了。我的感觉，我的理性，甚至我的良心都沉睡了。我四十年来的生活是可怕的作恶、卖淫、通奸、乱伦、扯谎和偷窃。总而言之，从十八岁左右一直到六十岁。除了杀人和造反外，什么事我都干过。现在我落在责罚苦痛的深渊里，一个丢尽脸面的死亡正在门外等候着我。然而我并没有感觉到我所处的可怕环境，我没有想到天堂和地狱。除了一下子就过去了的瞬时感触之外，好像被针刺了一下，稍微有点感觉，就过去了。我既无心去求上帝的慈悲，的确也没有想到这一点。在这几句话里，我想我说出了世界上最大的苦痛了。

我一切的恐慌都过去了，那地方的可怖现象我也习惯了，我对于狱里一切喧哗吵闹和发出这些声音的人们同样不会感到不安。总而言之，我变成一个新门的老犯人，罪恶无耻不下于里面的任何人。不，我连一向谈话时的良好礼貌和态度都失掉了。我完全堕落了，我已经不是我一向那样的人了，好像我除了现在这种态度之外，从未有过别的态度。

在我生命里这段良心麻木的时期，我碰到另一件出乎意料的事情，使我尝到了一些悲哀，这已经是失去的东西了。一天晚上她们告诉我前晚深夜有三个强盗被送进狱来，他们在到温德琐尔去的路上犯了抢劫案，我想是在韩思洛荒原，被乡下人追到亚克斯桥，在顽强地抵抗之后被擒了，当时有很多乡下人受了伤，还有几个死了。

那是用不着奇怪的，我们这些囚犯都很想看看这几位勇敢优秀的先生们。据说他们都是出类拔萃的人物，尤其是听说他们已经给了监狱看守长钱，早上将搬到前面院子去，住监狱里较好的房子。于是我们这些女人都站在路边，一定要看看他们。但是我的惊骇是无法形容的，我看见第一个走出来的男人就是我在兰开夏时的丈夫，就是在但斯铁不尔生活很阔绰，后来我嫁给最后一个丈夫的时候，又在布立克喜尔瞧见过的那个人，这些事在上文都已经说过了。

我见到这个人，惊骇得说不出话来，既不知道说什么好，也不知道怎么办好；他却不认得我，这是我当时唯一的安慰。我离开同伴，躲到那可怕的地方最隐蔽的一角，激动地哭了很久。“我是个多么可怕的人呀，”我说，“我害了多少可怜的人？我把多少绝望的可怜人送到魔鬼手里去？”我把这位先生的灾难完全归到我身上。在契斯特的时候，他告诉过我他被这段婚姻毁了，为了我的缘故他弄得绝望了。因为他以为我拥有巨资，就借了他绝无能力偿还的债，所以弄得不知走哪一条路好。他想去从军，背一杆枪，或者买一匹马，干他所谓巡游的生涯。虽然我从来没有告诉他我是个大财主，自己实在并没有骗他，但是我却设法使人们以为我是个大财主，因此我是他的一切不幸的根源。

这件出乎意料的事情比我所遇到的任何事都更深刻地触动了我的心，使我感到更强烈的忏悔。我整天整夜为他痛心，当她们对我说他是那帮大盗的领袖，他犯了这么多的抢劫案，就连汉德，惠特奈，金农夫这些大盗跟他相比都只好算作傻子的时候，我更加痛心。即使全国的男人全死净了，他也得上绞架；有不少的人都要来控告他。

我为他感到极大的悲哀。和他的情况一比，我自己的情况就没有什么值得苦痛的了，为了他的缘故，我只有责备自己。我悲叹自己的不幸，同他现在所遭到的毁灭相比，任何事情都不像起先那么有味了。我起初对于过去那种可怕的生涯的感想又重新回到心上来了，这些念头一来，我对于所住的地方和里面的生活的厌恶跟着也来了。总之，我完全改变了，变成了另外一个人。

当我这样为他伤心的时候，传来一个消息说，下一次大审判开庭的时候将有一张控告信递给大法官控告我，我的生死也将在那时断定。我的性情又变回来了，先前的那种顽梗的精神又消失了，罪恶的感觉又在我的心头涌现。总之，我开始思索，而思索的确是从地狱到天堂的一个步骤。我前面所说的那种麻木不仁的情况只是因为失去了思索。恢复了思索能力的人就是恢复了人性的人。

我一开始思索，第一个感触是这样冲口说出的：“上帝！我将如何结果呢？我一定会被处死刑！我将被判罪，这是一定的，判决之后除了死刑之外不会有别的处置！我没有朋友，我该怎么办呢？我一定会被判罪！上帝呀，可怜我吧！我将如何结果？”你们会说，这是麻木之后，第一次涌到灵魂里去的悲哀思想，但是说这些话也只是对于临到头上的灾祸的恐惧。这里面没有一句真诚忏悔的话。然而，我的确愁闷得厉害，烦恼到了极点，因为在世界上我没有朋友可以听我述说我这苦闷的心情。这种苦闷沉重地压着我，一天中我总有好几回因此而晕倒，顿时失去知觉。我把我的老保姆请来。说句公道话，她的确尽了一个忠实朋友的义务。她用尽法子，想阻止大法官得到那张控告信。她找到一两位陪审官，和他们谈，努力想使他们对这件事帮忙，因为我没有拿走什么东西，也没有破门而进的情形。但是这完全没有用，因为他们受其他陪审官的支配。那两个姑娘坚决地说那是真正的事实，陪审官又看到状子，控告我偷窃同入室行劫。

当他们带给我这个消息的时候，我晕倒下去，我醒过来以后，我想我会被这愁闷压死。我的保姆对于我真可说是一个忠实的母亲。她可怜我，陪我哭，为我哭，但是她不能帮助我。更使我可怕的是，全狱的人都谈论着，我将受死刑。我听见她们彼此常谈论这件事，看到她们摇着头，说她们也觉得难过和其他这类的话。但是仍然没有人告诉我她们的意思。最后有一位看守人偷偷地来到我面前，微叹一声对我说：“弗兰德斯太太，你将在星期五受裁判，”（那天才是星期三）“你想怎么办呢？”

我的脸色变得惨白，说道：“只有上帝知道我将怎么办，我不知如何是好。”

“哎呀，”他说，“我也不必讨你欢心，你就预备去死吧，因为我相信你一定会被判死刑。他们既然说你是个积案重重的人，我相信你不会碰到什么大慈悲。他们说你那案子是很明白的，证人们这么实实在在地发誓说看到你犯罪。那你是无法否认的。”

这对于一个像我这样满腹忧虑的人，真是致命的一刀，有许久我说不出一句话来。最后我大哭起来，对他说道：“天呀！先生，我应当怎么办呢？”

“怎么办！”他说，“去找狱里的牧师来，和他谈一谈。因为，真的，弗兰德斯太太，除非你有很有势力的朋友，否则你将不是这世界上的人了。”

这的确是很干脆的说法，但是对于我未免太残忍了，至少我是这样想的。他走后，我陷入了最大的纷乱之中，整晚我都醒着。现在我开始做祷告了，自从我最后的丈夫过世之后，至少是过世不久，我就没有做过祷告了。我真可以说是做祷告，因为我心情这么混乱，觉得这么恐怖，虽然哭着，说了几遍通常祷告的话：“上帝，怜悯我吧！”我却绝没有想到我是个可怜的罪人，也没有想起向上帝忏悔我的罪过，求他为了耶稣的缘故而赦免我。我的处境使我觉得非常沮丧，因为我将受生死的裁判，我知道我会被判处死刑。因此我整夜喊道：“上帝呀！我将是怎样的结局呢？上帝呀！我将如何是好呢？上帝呀！我将上绞架了！上帝呀！怜悯我吧！”还有其他这类的话。

我那位伤心的可怜的保姆现在正同我一样地焦心，比我还更诚恳地忏悔着，虽然她并没有受审判的危险。她同我一样地该受罚，她自己也这样讲。但是许多年来她自己没有干什么，只是接收我和别人所偷来的东西以及鼓动我们去偷东西。她哭着，举动像个疯子，绞着自己的手，喊着她完了，相信灾祸一定从上天落到她身上，她一定会受天的责罚，因为她害了她所有的朋友，她带着某人，某人，某人，走上绞架。一连数了十个或者十一个人，都是未得善终的，其中有几个我在前面已经说过了。现在她又使我毁灭了，因为当我想放手的时候，她劝我继续干下去。说到这里，我打断她的话。“不，妈妈，不，”我说，“别这样说，因为当我得到那绸缎商赔偿的时候，当我从哈里奇回来的时候，你都劝我离开这种生涯，我却不听你的话，所以你是不该负这责任的。全是我把自己毁了，我使自己走到这种悲惨的境地。”我们这样谈着，在一起过了很多时候。

唉！我们找不出补救的办法。控告还在进行着，星期四那天我被带到裁判所去，在那里受所谓的预审，第二天正式审判。在预审的时候，我不服罪，我的确可以这样做，因为我的罪名是偷窃同破屋行劫。那就是说，偷去安孙尼·约翰生的价值四十六金镑的两块绣花缎子，打破他的大门，我很明白他们绝对不能证明我打破了大门，他们甚至于不能说我拿开一根门闩。

星期五那天我被带去受审判。前两三天我已经哭得很累了，所以星期四晚上我睡得出乎意料地好，因此受审时我表现了想象不到的勇气。

当审判开始，罪名宣布之后，我想说话，但是她们告诉我见证人应当先说，然后审判官才可以听我的自辩。见证人是那两个姑娘，真是一对利嘴的女人，虽然事情多半是真的，可是她们夸大其词到极点，发誓说我已经拿了货物，藏在衣服里面，准备带走。当她们发现的时候，我一只脚已跨出门槛，跟着又把另一只脚也跨出去，所以在她们抓住我之前，我已经带着货完全离开那屋子，走上了街。然后她们拉住我，带我进来，就在我身上搜出那些东西。这许多事实大都是真的，但是我坚持说，她们阻止我，是在我的脚完全迈出门槛之前。但是这没有什么用处，因为假使没有人捉住我，我准会把这些货物带走。

我申辩，我没有偷什么，他们也没有丢失什么，门本来就开着的，我打算进去买点东西。即使我看见没有人在店里，拿一两件在手上，那也不能证明我存心偷窃，因为我没有把东西带到门外，我不过是想在光线较好的地方瞧清楚一点。

法庭绝不肯承认我这句话，而且还嘲笑我，说怎么会存心去买东西，因为那不是个卖东西的铺子，至于拿到门口为了可以瞧清楚些，那两个姑娘也嘲笑了半天，极尽挖苦之能事。她们告诉法庭，我已经看够了，觉得很满意，因为我已经把这些东西包在衣服里面，带着走了。

总之，我被判了偷窃罪，但是被认为没有破门入劫，这不能给我什么安慰。第一个罪状足够判我死刑，第二个罪状对我没什么影响了。第二天，我给传去受那可怕的判决，当他们问我有没有话说，有没有不该定罪的理由的时候，我站着不哼一声，但有一个人站在我背后大声劝我向审判官细说，因为他们也许能够原谅我。这鼓起了我说话的勇气，我告诉他们我没有什么理由能够阻止他们立即判决，但是我有许多话可说，求法庭的慈悲。我希望他们看到这件案子里有些情况也许可以得到原谅。我并没有破门，没有带什么东西走，谁也没有失掉什么东西。那些货物的主人也表示他希望从宽处置我（他的确很诚恳地这样说）。充其量，这也不过是初犯，我从来没有到过什么法庭。总之，我说话时表现了自己起先以为做不到的勇气，说得这么动听，虽然含着眼泪，但是眼泪并没有挡住我的言语，我看出这番话足使听到的人们落泪。

审判官严肃地，沉默地坐着，静静地听着，给我时间让我把全部的话说出来，但是不置可否，最后对我下死刑的判决。我一听到这个判决就好像是死去了，判词宣读后，我吓得糊涂了。我什么力气都没有了，我的舌头也不能讲话了，眼睛什么也看不见了。

我可怜的保姆痛心到极点，她从前是安慰我的人，现在自己却需要人家来安慰了。她有时呜咽，有时大怒，从表面看起来，她的神经错乱得和疯人院里的疯子一样。她不仅为我痛心，同时对于自己罪恶的生涯也感到了恐怖，开始用一种和我极不相同的心情去看那些罪恶。因为她不单是为了这个不幸的事件伤心，而且对于她自己的罪恶极真诚地忏悔。她也请了一位牧师——一个真挚虔敬的好人，到她家里，靠着他的帮助，她诚恳地进行着忏悔的工作。我相信，牧师也相信，她的确是真的忏悔了。而且，她不单是那时候，在那个关键的时候忏悔，我听说，她一直忏悔，到她死去的那一天。

我现在的情形是只可意会，不可言传的。除了死以外，我没有什么前途。既然没有朋友来援救我，我所能料到的只是看到我的名字将登在下星期五发下来的和其他五个人同时处死的命令里。

在这个当儿，我那个伤心可怜的保姆请了一位牧师来找我。他严肃地劝我忏悔我过去一切的罪恶，不要再同我自己的灵魂开玩笑了。请我不要骗自己，以为尚有一线生机，他说他听见人们说那是绝不可能的，他叫我用我整个灵魂丝毫不假地看着上帝，请他为了基督的缘故赦免我。他引用圣经里恰当的话来做他劝告的根据，那些话都是鼓励罪人去忏悔，离开他们所走的邪恶的道路。他说完之后，跪下来和我一同祈祷。

现在可以说我第一次感到一些真正的忏悔。我开始厌恶我过去的生涯，因为我既瞧到一点身后的光景，人生的一切开始显出和以前很不相同的样子，我相信每个人在这种时候都会感到这样的。世上的幸福，欢欣同悲哀在我眼里全都不一样了。我那时心里所想的比我一生所知道的要高尚得多。我于是觉得过分看重俗世的东西，即使是世上最值钱的东西，真是天下最傻的事。

“永生”这个字带着它一切神秘的意义在我面前出现了，我对于它有很多的想法，竟不知道如何说起了。其中的一个是一切快乐的事情——我指的是，我们从前所认为快乐的事情——现在看来是多么荒谬呀！尤其当我想起就是这些龌龊无聊的小事使我们失掉了永久的幸福。

随着这个念头，我心中产生了对于我过去生活中糊涂行为的严重责难。我现在正走向未来的世界，在那里我却丧失了一切永久幸福的希望，而且我在那里是该受一切苦痛的。这些苦痛又是永久的，这更增加了我的恐惧。

我是不配向任何人说教的，但是我所说的正是那时我实在的心境。我已经尽了我的能力，但是绝说不出当时我心上的那种强烈的印象。真的，那些印象是不能用言语形容的，即使是可能的，我也不是个善于运用文字把它们表达出来的人。那是每个清醒读者的事，随着他们自己的境遇去体会此中的意义吧。无疑地这是人人有时会感觉到的。我指的是，对于将来比对于目下的事情看得更清楚些，看出自己将来所处的不幸的境况。

但是我得回头来说我的事情。这位牧师催促我，在我认为适当的范围之内告诉他我对于死后事情所持的态度。他告诉我，他来的目的不像狱里的牧师那样，他们的目的是逼着犯人说出坦白的话来，以便侦察出别的犯人的案情。他的职务却是感动我，使我能够自由地说出我既往的罪恶，因此可以减去我心上的负担，使他能够尽力安慰我。他请我相信，无论我对他说了什么话，他一定留在心里，好像只有上帝和我知道这个秘密，他什么都不想知道，只希望能够给我适当的劝告，为我祈求上帝。

他对我这样诚恳，这样和善，竟打开了我感情的闸门，他闯入我灵魂的深处，我将我一生所犯的罪过都对他说了。总之，我把我全部的历史简略地告诉了他，让他看到了我五十年来生活的缩影。

我没有对他隐瞒什么，他因此劝我诚恳地忏悔，而且向我解释所谓的忏悔是什么意思，然后说出上帝施之于罪人的广大无边的慈悲。于是他就使我不能再说什么失望或者怕上帝拒绝这类的话了，第一个晚上他就这样离开了我。

第二天早上他又来看我，继续用他那种方法解释上帝慈悲的意义。照他说起来，得到这种慈悲并不难，只要真想得到：愿意接受这种慈悲就行。只要对我所做过使上天愤怒的事情认真地追悔同厌恶就行了。这位异人的高超言论我是无法重述的，我只能说，他使我的心复活了，带我到一个我从前丝毫也不知道的境界里去。我为了过去的种种而羞赧流泪，可是想到我真正忏悔，得到忏悔的安慰，又暗暗地感到一种说不出的快乐——我指的是，我有被赦免的希望。这些思想这么迅速地活动着，它们在我心上所留的印象这么深刻，我想那时我能够坦然地去受刑，心里绝不会感到半点的不安，正像一个忏悔者把全部灵魂投到无限慈悲的怀中一样。

这位忠厚的先生看到这些谈话给我这么大的影响，也很感动，因此他感谢上帝，他曾经来找我，决定不离开我，一直到最后一刻。

我们被判决后十二天，才有执行的命令下来。然后所谓死刑的命令也下来了，我的名字也在里面。这对于我近来的决心真是一个可怕的打击。我的心的确沉下去了，我接连晕过去两回，可是一句话也没有说。这位好心肠的牧师很为我伤心，尽力用他以前的那些话和动人的辞令来安慰我。那天晚上他和我在一起，一直到狱吏让他离开的时候，否则他就得整夜和我关在一处，这他却是不愿意的。

第二天也是预定受刑的前一天，我很纳闷为什么整天没有看见他。我非常沮丧，心里很愁郁，真是灰心到了极点。因为得不到他从前常给我的那些安慰。我极不耐烦，精神抑郁到不能想象的程度。等到四点钟，他到我房里来。在那地方什么事情都是非钱莫办的，我靠着金钱的力量得到一种优待，没有拘禁在所谓的死囚牢里，跟那将受死刑的犯人一起，却自己有一个龌龊的小房间。

我听到他在门外的声音，甚至还没看到他，我的心就高兴得跳起来。关于他没来的事，他稍稍道了歉，告诉我他一直在为我的事情奔忙。录事已经答应把我这个案子说得轻些，总之，他给我弄到了一张缓刑的令状。

他尽量小心地把这件事告诉我，如果把它隐瞒起来却是加倍的残忍。因为从前的悲哀我受不了，现在的快乐我也同样受不了，我晕倒了。比第一次更危险，我好久才恢复过来。

这位好人先向我说出很合乎基督徒精神的劝告，叫我不要因为得到缓刑而忘了过去的悲哀，他还说他得离开我，去把这缓刑的状子登记上去，而且给执行官瞧一瞧。正要走的时候，他站起来，很严肃地为我向上帝祈祷，希望我的忏悔永远是出于至诚的，真挚的。他希望我这次重新获得生命以后，不要再做那种愚蠢的事，那些事我曾经下过郑重的决心不去再干了。我也热烈地参加这个祷告，整个晚上，我对于上帝的仁慈，比我以前在悲哀中所感到的更加深刻。他饶恕了我的罪，使我免受死刑，我对于过去的罪恶也更加痛恨了。

也许有人以为这些话是没有意义的，跟这本书的主题无关。尤其是，我想许多人看了我故事里这些罪恶的行为也许觉得很开心，对于我现在说的这些话，一定不喜欢听。但这的确是我一生中最好的时候，对于我最有益，对于别人也是很大的教训。然而，我希望这些人肯让我把这个故事说完。如果说他们喜欢罪恶甚于忏悔，说他们宁愿这个故事变成整个的悲剧（这是很可能的），那对他们倒是个深刻的讽刺。

我要继续说我的故事了。第二天早上狱里呈现一片悲惨的景象。早上我首先听到的是大教堂的钟声。那是一天的开始。钟声一响，死囚牢里发出了凄凉的呻吟和哭声，那里躺了六个可怜的人，那天要受死刑，有的犯了这种罪，有的犯了那种罪，还有两个犯了谋杀罪。

接着牢房里传出一阵嘈杂声，各种犯人为了那些将被处死的可怜人表示不幸的悲叹，但是每个人的态度绝不相同。有的为他们哭，有的欢呼，预祝他们一路平安，有的咒骂送他们到这儿来的人，有很多人可怜他们，也有极少数的人为他们祈祷。

我心中实在不太宁静，不能来祝福那似乎把我从毁灭中抢救出来的仁慈的上天。我老是沉默着，好像是个哑巴，我被热烈的情感所压倒，不能说出我心里的话。因为在这样的时候，情感的确很激动，不能立即控制住。

当这几个判定死刑的可怜虫正预备去受刑，狱里的牧师正忙着劝他们引颈就范的时候，我全身一直在发抖，即使我同他们一同处死，也不过如此。前一天我的确曾经想到是免不了和他们同归于尽的。我颤抖得非常厉害，仿佛发了疟疾，所以我不能说话，就像疯子似的。他们一上车，走了之后——这个场面我没有勇气去瞧——我说，他们走了之后，我忽然大哭起来，就像精神错乱似的，哭得很厉害，哭了很久。我不知道怎么办好，我又不能止住，不能压住，虽然我尽力量和勇气去做了。

我差不多哭了两个钟头，我相信我直哭到他们走出了这个世界，然后我感到一种虚心、忏悔同严肃的快乐。那是一种真正的快乐，或者一种感激的热情，但是我仍然不能用言语发泄出来，那一天大部分的时间我都是这样过去的。

夜里这位好牧师又来看我，还是说他通常劝我的那套话。他向我庆贺上帝给了我忏悔的时间，而那六个可怜虫的命运却已经定了，他们的灵魂现在是不能得救了。他认真地劝我保持从前想到永离尘世时的那种思想。最后他告诉我别以为危险已经完全过去了，要我明白一张缓刑令并不是赦免令，将来有什么结果，他是不能预卜的。然而，我既得到这个恩惠，我就有更充分的时间，我该好好地利用。

这些话，使我听了很悲伤，似乎我应该预料到这事还免不了一个悲惨的结局，然而他对这事也没有把握。那时我也没有再问下去，因为他说过他将尽他的力量弄出一个好结果来，他希望他能做到，但是他劝我不要太乐观了。事后的变化证明他说的话是有道理的。

过了两个礼拜，我恐怕我将被列在下次法庭的死刑名单里。我费了很多劲，最后甘心自请流徙，才避免了死刑。我的名誉这么坏，而且又说我是个犯案重重的人。可是关于这一点他们并不十分公平，因为在法律上讲我并不是个犯案重重的人，不管在审判官眼里我怎么样，我从来都没有因为犯罪上过法庭。所以法官不能判我是个积案重重的犯人，但是录事却随意说我这案子的真情就是如此。

我现在的确对于自己的生命有把握了，但是我却被判了流徙。这虽然是件苦事，但是比较起来却还不坏。所以我不再批评这个判决，也不再谈论我自己要求的这个处分了。我们宁可接受任何的处分，也不甘心去死，尤其是像我这样对于死后的生活有个不安的预测。

那个好牧师虽然对于我是个陌生人，却用他的力量替我弄到一个缓刑令，他现在很后悔不该这样做。他说，他原想让我在忏悔的心情之下了结我的残生，这样我就不会又在流徙的一群坏人里面放荡起来。因为在这群人里面，假使我要不变得像以前那样放荡，那就需要上帝暗中特别的帮助。

我很久没有提到我的保姆了，她在这段时间病得很危险。她的病也跟我的判决一样，是注定要死的，在这期间她真诚地忏悔自己的罪过。我说，我没有提起她，因为我这些时候的确也没有见到她。但是现在她复原了，她刚能够出门，就来看我。

我告诉她我的情形以及我怎样被悲喜交集的情绪所激荡。我告诉她我怎样逃避了死亡，是拿什么条件换来的。当那位牧师说他怕我跑到那些流配的坏人当中，又要作恶的时候，她也在场。我心里对于这件事也的确愁闷得很，因为我知道和我一起送去的多半是些可怕的恶棍，因此我对我的保姆说那好牧师的忧虑不是无因的。“但是，”她说，“我希望你不要被这样可怕的榜样所引诱。”牧师一走开，她就对我说，请我不要灰心，因为她也许可以想出办法来替我开脱，这事她打算过后同我细谈。

我热切地看着她，她显出比平常更快乐的神气，我立刻想到我有无限得救的希望，但是无论如何我也想不出是什么办法，或者猜出一个可行的办法。然而我对这事太关心了，她非得说出她的办法，我才肯让她走。虽然她不大愿意说，但是我喋喋不休地追问下去，她只好简单地回答道：“唉，你不是有钱吗？你一生里可曾见过一个袋里有一百金镑的人，被流放到外国去的吗？我敢说没有，孩子。”

我立刻了解她的意思，但是我看不出有什么希望，怕免不了要严格地执行那项命令，既然把那种残忍的处置认为是一种慈悲，无疑一定会严格地执行。她不再说什么，只说：“我们试一试有什么办法没有。”我们那天晚上就这样分手了。

我在监狱里差不多待了十五个星期，这个流放的命令才签好字。这到底是为了什么缘故，我不知道，但是在十五个星期之后我被送到泰晤士河里一只船上，同我一起的有十三个犯人。是我在新门监狱时所看到的最邪恶不过的一群人。那真需要一本比我这部自传还要长的篇幅，去描写这十三个人的粗暴无礼和胡作非为。关于第二点，我有一本很有趣的记录，那是送他们到外地去的那位船主给我的，他叫他的船员详细地把他们的行为记下来。

在这里把我流配的最后命令下来之后到我上船之前这一段时间我所遇的零碎小事记下来，也许有人认为是件无聊的事。而且我现在已经快把这本传记结束了，也来不及细说那些事情。但是还有一些关于我和我那位兰开夏丈夫的事情，我不能忽略过去。

像我在前面所说的，他和其他三个同伴从普通牢房移到特别的牢房里去，因为过了不久他的同伴又给捉去一个。他们拘禁在这儿差不多有三个月没有传去受审，这到底是什么原因，我不得而知。也许他们想了法子去贿赂或者收买那班会来告发他们的人，法庭很久找不到证人来定他们的罪。法庭因为这事踌躇了很久之后，终于想法弄到了充分的证据把两个人先行了结。但是其余两个，我那位兰开夏丈夫就是其中的一个，还在未决之中。我想法庭对于他们两个共有一个充分的证据，但是法律却严格地规定需要两个证人，所以法庭也无从着手。然而，好像法庭也决定不把这两个人释放，他们深信最后总能得到其他的证据。为了这个目的，法庭就出了一个布告，说有这么两个犯人已经被抓到，凡是被他们抢过的人都可以到狱里来，认一认他们。

我利用这机会来满足我的好奇心，借口我也在但斯铁不尔的公共马车里被抢过，我要去看看这两个强盗。但是当我走进院子时，我化了装，蒙了脸，他看不清楚我，因此根本不晓得我是谁。当我回来的时候，我公开地说我很知道他们这些人。

全监狱里立刻传遍了这个消息：摩尔·弗兰德斯要来做证人，告发强盗里的一个，我将凭借这个功劳免得流配到外地去。

那两个强盗也听到这个消息，我的丈夫立刻想看一看这位很知道他、将做证人告发他的弗兰德斯太太。于是我得到许可去见他。我穿上我在那地方所能穿的最好的衣服，走到那里去，但是脸上蒙了一块头巾。他起先没有和我说什么，只问我认得他吗。我对他说，是的，认得他。但是我隐藏着我的面貌，又假装出另一种声调，所以他一点也没有猜出我到底是谁。他问我在什么地方见过他。我告诉他在但斯铁不尔同布立克喜尔之间的地方，但是我转过来问狱吏，我可不可以单独和他谈话。他说可以，随我的便，于是很客气地就退出了。

他一走开，我把门关好，揭开头巾，淌着眼泪说道：“我亲爱的，你认得我吗？”他脸色变灰白了，站着不说话，好像一个被雷打了的人。他不能战胜他的惊恐，只说了一句：“让我坐下吧。”说完就坐在桌子旁边，把手臂搁在桌上。他的头靠着他的手，眼睛盯着地板，好像一个傻子。我哭得那么厉害，过了好久才说出话来。但是我的情感借着眼泪发泄了之后，又重说了那句话：“我亲爱的，你认得我吗？”他听了答道：“是的。”接着很久没再说别的话。

在这样的惊恐之中过了一些时候，像我上面所说的，他望了我一眼，说：“你怎么这样残酷？”我没有立刻懂得他的意思，便问道：“你怎么能说我残酷呢？”“到这样一个地方来找我，”他说，“这不是等于侮辱我吗？我并没有抢劫过你，最少没有在大路上。”

我因此看出他完全不晓得我所处的可怜地位，以为我听说他在狱里，特意来责备他从前为什么离开我。但是我有太多的话要对他说，也顾不到生气了，简单地告诉他说，我绝不是来侮辱他，却是为了彼此安慰一下。当我告诉他我的情形在许多方面比他还坏的时候，他立即相信我没有侮辱他的意思。他听说我的情形比他还坏，脸上显出十分关切的神气，但是微笑着，有点精神错乱的样子，说道：“这怎么可能呢？当你看见我被铁链锁着，在新门监狱里，有两个同伴已经正法了，你能说你的境遇比我的还坏吗？”

“唉，我亲爱的，”我说，“假使我要说而你想听我那不幸的经过，那我们就要谈很久的时间。你很快就会知道，我的境遇比你的更坏。”

“这怎么可能呢？”他又说，“我预料下一次大审判时我的生死就决定了。”

“是的，那是很可能的，”我说，“但是我已经在前三次大审判时定了生死，判处死刑了，我的境况不是比你的还坏吗？”

于是他又站着不哼一声，就像受了惊吓不能说话的样子。过了一会儿他跳起来。“好一对不幸的夫妻！”他说，“这事怎么可能呢？”我拉着他的手，说道，“我亲爱的，坐下，让我们比较一下我们的悲哀。我也是这个牢狱里的囚犯，所处的环境比你还坏得多，我一告诉你我的详细情形，你就会相信我不是来侮辱你的。”说到这里，我们就坐下来，把我觉得告诉他也无妨的事情全告诉了他，最后对他说我弄得很穷，只好跟一班人结伴，去用我完全没有经验的办法来救济我的穷困。当他们去偷一个商人家的时候，我被抓住，因为我刚站在门槛外，那个女仆把我拉进去；我既没有扭断什么锁，也没有带什么东西走，然而他们说我有罪，判定死刑；但是审判官听人说我的境况很艰难，假使我肯流配到外地去的话，他答应把原判取消。

我告诉他，对我更不利的是狱里的人把我当作摩尔·弗兰德斯，她是一个有名的，成功的贼，他们都听到她的大名，却没有一个人见过她；但是他知道，这并不是我的名字。我把这事也全归咎于我的厄运。虽然这是他们第一次知道我干这类事情，他们就把我当作老犯看待。我详详细细地对他说出自从我前回看见他以后，我所遭遇的一切。但是我告诉他我的确后来又见过他，这件事他很可以相信。于是我又告诉他我在布立克喜尔怎样见到他；人们怎样凶猛地追赶着他，我怎样说出我认识他，说他是个很老实的绅士某某先生，那追喊怎样给打断了，警察官怎样就回去了。

他十分留心地听着我讲的一切经过，听我讲到一些细节时，就现出微笑的样子，因为这比起他带头干的事情来就太逊色了。但是当我讲到布立克喜尔这段故事时，他感到很惊讶。“我亲爱的，”他说，“那个在布立克喜尔阻拦住群众的人就是你吗？”

“是的，”我说，“的确是我。”于是我告诉他在那地方我所看到的他的一切情形。

“哎呀，那么，”他说，“那一次是你救了我的命了，我很高兴是你救了我，因此现在我要报答你，我要把你从现在的境遇里救出来，否则我情愿为你死去。”

我劝他不要这样，为着一个不值得救的生命冒这么大的险就太不值得了。他说这没有关系，我的生命在他眼里比全世界都值钱，因为这个生命给了他一个新生命。“因为，”他说，“除了那一次之外，直到我最后被抓住为止，我从没遇到过真正的危险。”真的，他告诉我他那回的危险是因为他相信没有人从那条路上来追赶他。他们离开和克利时是走的一条完全不同的路，然后绕个大弯子来到布立克喜尔，而且不是从大路走，因此他们深信没有人瞧见他们。

他把他的一段很长的经历告诉了我，那的确是一个很奇怪很有趣的故事。他告诉我在他娶我之前的十二年他就走上绿林这条路了。叫他做兄弟的那个女人根本不是他的什么亲戚，只不过是给他们通风报信的一个党羽，她老住在城里，认识了许多人。每逢大人物们离城的时候，她就给他们报信，因此他们得到了好多值钱的赃物。当她带我到他那里去的时候，她满以为替他找到了一大笔财产，但是结果他很失望，这他的确不能埋怨她。假使他运气好，我真如她所说的那样有一笔财产，他就决定不再干那勾当，而过一种新的安适的生活了。因此他就可以不在公共场所出现，直到大赦令下来，或者等他能够用钱得到大赦的时候，但是结果并非如此，他只好重操旧业。

他向我说了一大阵关于他的一些冒险，特别提到当他在利池菲尔附近抢了到西契斯特去的公共马车，得了一大批赃物那回事。此后他又怎样在西方劫了五个牲口商，他们是到尉尔特州的柏福特市集去买羊的。他告诉我这两次他得了很多钱，假使他知道上哪里去找我的话，他一定采取和我一同到弗吉尼亚去的我那个提议，或者到美洲的英国殖民地去垦荒。

他说他写了三封信给我，是照我所说的通信地址寄去的，但是没有得到一点回音。这我知道的确是真的，但是那些信是正当我同我前一个丈夫住在一起的时候收到的，因此我也毫无办法，所以也就没答复他，那么他也许会相信所写的信都遗失了。

这样他说，在失望之余又重操旧业，不过当他有这么多钱的时候，他不再像从前那样不顾生死地冒险了。然后，他对我叙述他和路上那班舍命不舍财的先生们拼命格斗的经过，给我看他所受的几处伤。他的确受过一两次很重的伤，有一次是被手枪的子弹打断了胳膊，另外一次是剑伤，那剑穿透他的身体，幸而没有刺中他的要害，他又医好了。他的一位同伴对他非常忠实友爱，扶着他骑了将近八十英里的长途，然后在一个离抢劫的地方很远的大城里找到一位外科医生，将他的胳膊接好。他们假装是到卡莱儿去旅行的先生们，途中受到强盗的截击，其中的一个打中了他的胳膊。

这些托词，他说，他朋友讲得这么巧妙，使得他们没有受到丝毫的嫌疑，他静静地躺着一直到完全复原。他告诉我那么多生动的冒险故事，我的确很难忍住不把它说出来。但是这是我的自传，而不是他的传记。

然后我问现在他的案子怎样了，他预料受审时会得到什么判决。他告诉我他们没有证据来定他的罪，因为那三个抢案里，法庭说他们是都有份的。他侥幸得很，只同其中一个案子有关，而且只有一个证人来证明这件事，用来做判决的根据是不充分的，但是人们预料会有几个人来做证人。当他刚看到我的时候，他真以为我是为了作证而来的，要是没有人来做证人，他想他是能够过得去的。他得到一些暗示说，假使他自愿流配，那么他可以不受审判，但是一想到这事他就免不了动气，心想他宁愿去受绞刑。

我责备他不该那样。首先假使他被流配，一个男子汉，尤其是像他这么一个英武有为的男人，总会有很多路子可以回来的。甚至在他未去之前就会想法脱逃了。他微笑地听着，说他顶喜欢那第二个办法，因为他心里有一种恐惧，最怕他们送他到殖民地去，好像罗马人送奴隶到矿里去做工一样。他认为到另一个世界去的路径，还是以绞刑架最好，这个意见是一切被环境所迫干了那剪径勾当的男子汉所共有的。在执行死刑的时候，当下一切的苦痛最少总算是结束了，至于将来，在他看来，一个人在监狱和死囚牢的压迫同烦恼之下，在他生命最后的两个星期里，他一定会比在美洲的森林同旷野里感到更诚恳的忏悔。奴隶的地位同苦工是男子汉绝不能忍受的，这无非是迫使他们后来当自己的刽子手，这样就更坏了，所以他一想起被流配就简直受不了。

我尽力劝他，还加上大家都知道的女人的特别辞令——眼泪。我对他说，当众受刑的耻辱对于一个男子汉在精神上的确是比他在外面所碰到的任何刺心的事都更使他难过。在外地他最少总有个求生的机会，在这里却一点也没有。让他去对付一只船的船主，那是天地间最容易的事情，大抵说，船主都是慷慨大量的人。只要态度好一点，尤其是让他们多得一些钱，他就能够将自己赎出，到弗吉尼亚去当个自由人。

他默默地看着我，我想我猜出他的意思了，那就是说，他没有钱；但是我猜错了，他的意思却不是这样。“你刚才说，我亲爱的，”他说，“在我去之前，就想出了个回来的路子，我认为这句话就是说在这里我就可以用钱把自己赎出。我宁愿出二百金镑，免去流配，而不愿花一百金镑，到那里才获得自由。”

“这是因为，我亲爱的，”我说，“你不像我那么了解那个地方。”

“也许是这样的，”他说，“但是我相信，你也是知道的，假使不是因为你有一位母亲在那里，你也会像我那样做的。”

我告诉他，我的母亲也许已经死了好几年了。至于我在那里的其他亲戚，我现在不知道他们的生死，我的不幸既然把我弄到几年来这样的情况，我和他们已经断绝来往了。他们可以想到，假使我第一次看见他们时我是一个流配的罪人，他们对我一定很冷淡，所以即使我到那里去，我决定不去见他们。假使想到我在那里的许多计划，我的一切不快之感就全都消失了。假使他看出他也是非去不可的，我可以很容易地教他怎样处置自己，那就是绝不是去当一个奴隶，尤其我看出他并不缺钱，因为钱是在苦难中唯一的朋友。

他微笑着，说他并未告诉过我他有钱。我打断他的话，告诉他我希望他不要误会我的意思，以为我希望他供给我什么，而且，虽然我没有多少钱，我也不缺钱用。我倒愿意把自己的一点也给他，而不肯减少他所有的，我知道流配的时候，他是需要他全部的钱的。

对于这一点他用一种最深情的态度说出他的心迹。他告诉我他所有的钱并不多，但是假使我要用这笔钱的话，他绝不肯向我少说点。他请我相信，他说那句话时并不是这个意思。他所注意的只是我所提的脱身办法，在这里他知道怎样办，但是到了那儿他将成为世上最无依靠的可怜人。

我对他说他用不着杞人忧天，使自己恐惧。假使他有钱——我很喜欢听说他有——他不单可以避免被流配——过奴隶的生活，还可以在一个新的基础上重新做人，像他这么一个人，只要在这种情况下注意勤勉，必定不会失败的。他一定会记得这是好几年前我向他建议的事，当时我提这事也是为了彼此的生活，希望恢复我们在世界上的财产。我现在要告诉他，为了要他相信我有成功的把握，我完全知道用什么方法，而且深信一定不会失败，他将看到我先解脱自己，然后自由地陪他去。不是因为非去不可，而是出于自愿，或者带了足够的钱使他相信我这么干，并不是出于我没有他的帮助就不能过活，却是因为我想我们共同的不幸既是如此，就足够使我们结合起来。离开这个地方，去到另一个地方住下，那里的人谁也不会因为我们的过去而责骂我们，我们也用不着害怕监狱，也没有死囚牢的恐惧追赶着我们。在那里我们可以怀着无限满意的心情回头来瞧我们已往的灾难，这时我们想我们的敌人已经完全忘却我们了，我们是新人住在一个新世界里，谁也没有什么难听的话对我们说，我们也不对谁说。

我用这么多的理由把他深深感动，这么圆满地答复了他一切的抗议，他拥抱着我，说我这么诚心地，这么多情地待他，真把他说服了。他会听我的话，尽量屈服于自己的命运，为的是希望在困苦的环境中可以得到我这么一个忠心的劝告者和朋友的安慰和帮助。但是他请我牢记，我起先提到的话，就是说，也许有法子在他走之前脱身，完全可以避免流配，他说如果可能那就更好了。我对他说，他会看出，而且感到十分满意，我在这方面将尽我的力量去办，假使不能成功，我将把其余的事办妥。

在这个长久的商谈之后，我们分手的时候他做出深厚的爱恋的表情，我想几乎等于，如果没有超过的话，我们在但斯铁不尔离别时的情愫。现在我比以前更清楚为什么他不肯送我到伦敦，只是到但斯铁不尔，为什么当我们在那里分手的时候，他告诉我走那一段到伦敦的路，对他是不便的，不然他一定送我去。我前面说过，他的生平叙述出来会成为一本比我的自传更有趣味的传记。真的，里面最奇怪不过的是这不要命的生意他干了整整二十五年，却从来没有被抓住过。他的成功都很特别，很惊人，有时他过很舒服的日子，在一个地方一下子隐居一两年，养活他自己和一个男仆。他常坐在咖啡馆里，听被他抢过的人们叙述他们怎样被抢，还有地点和当时的情况，所以他一听便知那是以前他所干的。

当他不幸把我当作一个拥有厚资的女人娶来的时候，他好像就是这样住在利物浦附近。假使我是他所希望的那么一个有钱的女人，我真相信，像他所说的，他将不再干那勾当，以后永远诚实地过活了。

他虽然不幸被抓住，却有一种好运气，当告发他的那桩抢案发生的时候他确实未曾在场。所以没有一个被抢的人能够发誓说他是个强盗，或者加什么罪在他身上。但是他既是跟伙伴们一同被抓，好像有一个利嘴的乡下人实实在在地赌咒他是强盗，大概还有其他人看了通告会来出庭，所以法庭预料可以得到几个证人来控告他，因此他还是被拘留起来。

然而，许他自请流配这个提议，据我所知道的，是出于某一位大人物从中缓颊的力量，他极力劝他在受审判之前接受这个提议。真的，他既晓得有几个人会来同他捣乱，我想他朋友的意思是不错的，我整天整夜老向他啰唆叫他不要再拖延了。

最后，经过了很多困难，他终于答应了。他既不是像我那样由法庭正式许可流配出去，所以他看出自己处于一种困难的地位，不能避免流配，像我以前所说的那样。因为那位替他求到这恩典的好朋友替他担保他自己会流配，在规定的期间内不会回来。

这个困难把我的计划完全打破了，因为我此后所想的搭救我自己的办法就无效了，除非我肯抛弃他，让他一个人独自到美洲去。他申明如果这样的话，他宁愿冒险脱逃，虽然他深知他会立刻走上绞刑架的。

我现在要回头来说我自己的事情了。按我的判决书，我被流配的时候快到了。我的保姆，她仍然是我的心腹朋友，曾想法去取得一个赦令，但是这办不到，除非付出很大一笔钱，这样对我财产的损失就太大了，我为了得到自由只好弄得赤条条地空无一物。除非我决定重操旧业，但是不如流配，因为我知道在那里我能够生活，在这里却无法谋生。那位好牧师为了另一个理由坚持我不该流配，但是人们告诉他，我的性命是他一请求就还给我了，所以他不应当再求什么。他对于我离国感觉很伤心，因为，他说，他怕我将失掉那些好念头，那是死的预期起先给我的，后来他的教训使这些念头更加深刻，因此这位虔诚的先生对于我非常焦虑。

另一方面，我想取消流配命令的念头的确没有从前那么深切，但是我极力将我的理由隐起，不让这位牧师知道，一直到底，他一直认为我是最不愿意，最痛心离国的。

那是在二月里，我同其他七个所谓罪人被交给一个往弗吉尼亚做生意的商人，上了一只停在德夫福特海角的船。狱吏把我们送到船上，船主给了一张收条。

我们整晚关在舱口底下，紧紧地挤着，我想我将因为缺乏空气而窒息。第二天早上船起锚，沿河驶去，到他们叫作巴格拜窟的一个地方，他们告诉我们说，在商人的合同上订好，不让我们有任何偷逃的机会。然而，当船到那里抛锚的时候，我们得到更大的自由，尤其是准许我们到甲板上，但是不许到船后段的甲板，那是特别留着给船主和旅客们的。

听到我头顶上面嘈杂的声音，感到船的行动，我知道船又扬帆出发了。我起先很惊奇，害怕我们的朋友不许再来看我们了。但是不久，当我看出他们又抛锚，一会儿就有人来向我们通告我们是在哪里。第二天早上我们可以有走上甲板的自由，我们的朋友也可以来看我们，假使我们有朋友的话，我就安心了。

整个晚上我躺在舱面的硬板上，像我们这一帮其他的搭客那样，但是我们带有铺盖可睡的人们后来可以住在小房子里，还有一间房子可以安置衣服箱子，假使我有行李的话（这句话很可以添上去）。因为里面有几个人，除开身上所穿的之外，并没有其他的内衣、衬衫、一块布，或者一件羊毛衣服，也没有一个小铜币可以拿来自助。然而我看他们在船里也过得不坏。尤其是女人们，她们替水手们洗衣服，得到的钱足够她们购买所需要的任何日常用的东西。

第二天早上我们可以到甲板上去的时候，我问一位船员，我可不可以送一封信给岸上的人，让我的朋友们知道船靠在什么地方，将一些必需品给我送来。这位好像是水手长，一个非常文雅有礼的人，他告诉我可以有这种自由以及其他我想得到而他也能够毫无危险地允许我的一切自由。我对他说我不想别的。他答道这只船的舢板将在下次潮来时上伦敦去，他将叫人们把我的信带去。

所以，当那只舢板开走的时候，水手长来找我，对我说那只舢板将开了，他自己也去，问我信写好没有，他将自己替我带去。这你们是会相信的，我自己早已预备好笔、墨水同纸，我已写好一封寄给我保姆的信，里面附了一封给我同狱的那个男犯人的信，然而我不让她知道他是我的丈夫。在给我保姆的那封信里，我让她知道船停在哪里，恳切地叫她将我知道她已经预备好做旅行用的东西给我送来。

当我把这封信交给水手长的时候，我给他一个先令，我告诉他这用做脚夫或者送信人的工钱。我求他一到岸上，就派人把这封信送去，为的是假使可能的话，我能够得到这个人带回来的回信。那么我就可以知道我的东西到底是怎么样。“因为，先生，”我说：“假使船开走，我那东西还没有上船，我就完了。”

当我给他那一个先令的时候，我设法使他看出我比通常的囚犯有更多的钱财，因为他看见我有一个钱袋，里面有许多钱。我发现这么一来立刻使我得到绝不相同的待遇，因为虽然出于对一个困苦中的女人的一种自然的同情，他从前也的确是很有礼貌，但是此后他更客气了，使我在船上可以得到更好的待遇，那是我在别种境况里所不能得到的。这在后面就可以看出。

他很诚实地将我的信递到我保姆的手里，带回一封她亲笔的回信，当他给我那封回信的时候，同时还给了我那一个先令。“这，”他说，“这是你的先令，又回来了，因为我自己送那封信去的。”我不知道怎么说好，我非常纳闷这种举动。但是停了一会儿，我说，“先生，你太好了，那真是不应该，你自己还得出车钱。”

“不，不，”他说，“我已得到太多的报酬了。那位太太是谁？你的姐姐吗？”

“不，先生，”我说，“她不是我的亲戚，她却是我一个亲爱的朋友，我世上唯一的朋友。”

“唉，”他说，“世界上这样的朋友也不多呀。哎呀，她为了你哭得像个孩子。”

“是的，”我又说，“我相信她肯出一百金镑，把我从现在的环境里救出来。”

“她肯这样办吗？”他说。“我相信只要一半的钱，我就能把你放在得救的途上。”但是这句话他是低声说的，为的是谁也不会听到。

“哎呀！先生，”我说，“但是，那必定是这样的一种得救：假使我再被抓到，就会要了我的命。”

“不，”他说，“假使你离开了船，你该自己留心，此后我是不敢担保的。”那时我们就谈到这里为止。

在这段时间里，我的保姆始终对我很忠实，把我那封信送到监狱里给我丈夫，带来一封回信。第二天她自己来到船上，首先给我带来一架航海床同一切轻便的家伙。她还带来一个航海箱——那是一个专为水手而制的箱子，里面有种种与人便利的设备，装了几乎我所需要的一切东西。在箱子的一角，有一个秘密屉子，我的银钱就放在里面——那就是说，我决定自己带去的那一部分。我叫她把我一部分的钱留在她那里，等我在那里住下时，好买我所需要的货物寄去。因为在那里什么东西都是用烟草去换来，现金实在没有多大用处，从这里带去更是个大损失。

但是我的情形是特别的。没有钱，没有货物，空手到那里去，那对我是绝不相宜的，但是像我这样一上岸就要卖给人家当奴隶的可怜犯人，带着一堆货物将会引起人们的注意，也许会被公家没收。所以我将一部分资本这样带去，剩下一部分存在我保姆那里。

我的保姆还带了许多别的东西给我，但是我在船上显出太充裕的样子也是不相宜的，最少要等到我知道船主是怎样的一个人。当她来到船上的时候，我想她真的几乎死去。一看到我，想起要这样同我分离了，她的心沉重了，她哭得那么悲切，有好半天我不能同她谈什么话。

我利用这个时间来读我囚伴的信，可是这使我很焦虑。他告诉我，他怕来不及跟我坐一条船去，最可虑的是，他开始怀疑他们肯不肯让他去挑选自己愿意坐的船，虽然他是自愿请求流配的。他们却会把他安置在他们所指定的船上，把他交托给船主，正同其他囚犯一样。所以他失望起来，恐怕在到弗吉尼亚之前他没有见我的机会了，这使他感到很绝望。另一方面，假使我到不了那里，假使海上的危险或者个人的不幸使我离开人间，他在那里将成为世上最可悲的人了。

这是个很恼人的消息，我不知道走哪一条路好。我告诉了我保姆水手长所说的话，她很热诚，想替我去同他商议。但是我不想这样做，必定要先知道我的丈夫，或者她所说的我的囚伴能否有和我同去的自由。最后，我被迫把全盘经过都向她说出，除了他是我丈夫这一点。我对她说，我同他订了一个肯定的条约，假使他能有同船去的自由，我一定和他同去，因为我看出他有钱。

然后，我向她说了一大篇，当我们到那里的时候，我打算怎么办。我们如何能够耕种，拓荒，总之，用不着什么冒险就可以致富。我当作一个大秘密告诉她，他一上船，我们就结婚。

她听到了这些话，很快就欣然地赞成我去，自那时起她就极力设法及时把他从监狱里弄出来，让他好和我一同走。这件事最后做成功了，可是费了不少心思，而且经过了流配犯队的各种手续，实在说起来，他并不是流犯，因为他尚未曾受审判，所以这使他很痛心。我们的命运现在是定了，我俩也都上了船，当个可耻的流犯，运到那边卖给人家当奴隶，我的期限是五年，他却有人担保，他在世之日，永不再回到英国，因此他感到很沮丧。像个犯人似的被带到船上，这个耻辱使他很生气，因为起先人们告诉他，他可以自己流徙到外地去，所以他可以像一个自由人出发到外地去。的确，法庭也没有命令，说他到美洲的时候，把他像我们那样卖出去。因此他要缴船钱给船主，我们是不缴的。至于其他，他真糊涂得同小孩子一样，不知道怎样处置自己和他所有的东西，什么事都只知道听别人的指挥。

我们第一件事是合计一下我们的资本。他对我很诚恳，告诉我当他关进监狱的时候，他的财产还不少。但是像他那样像个绅士似的住在里面，交朋友——那比前项的费用要大十倍——求人情，是很费钱的。总之，他剩下的财产只有一百零八镑，他全换成金币，带在身边。

我向他同样诚实地说出我的资本，那是说，我提出自己带去的那一部分，因为我已决定，不管有什么事发生，我总是把我存在保姆那里的钱留下。假使我死了，我身边的钱给他已经够了，放在我保姆手里的就可以变作她自己的，她的确很应该得到我这一份财产。

我身边带着的资本是二百四十六金镑同一些零头的先令，所以我们合起来有三百五十四金镑，但是这两项都是不义之财，像这样把两份不义之财合起来共同生活的事，世上几乎是从来没有的。

我们最大的不幸是这些资本都是现金，这东西带到殖民地去是不生利的货物。我相信他这笔钱的确是他在世界上唯一的财产，像他对我所说的。但是当那灾难降临到我头上的时候，我有七八百金镑左右存在银行里，又有世上最忠实的一位朋友替我料理，而且因为这位朋友是个有义气的女人，我还留了三百金镑在她手里，就像上面我所说的。此外，还有几件很值钱的东西，尤其是两只金表，几件金银器皿，几只戒指——这都是偷来的东西。金银器皿，戒指，表都和金钱一起搁在我箱子里面，带了这笔钱，我这个六十一岁的，虽然免受绞刑，却被流配到外地去的可怜的犯人出发到一个所谓的新世界去。我的衣服又粗又坏，但是并没有破烂不堪，整船里没有一个人知道我身边带了什么值钱的东西。

然而，我有许多好衣服，好布料也很充足，我叫人把它们装在两个大箱里，运到船上来，不当作我的货物，都是写明交给弗吉尼亚某某人，那就是我的真名字。船主签过字的提货单也在我衣袋里。在这两个箱子里有我的金银器皿，我的金表和一切值钱的东西，只是除了我的现钱，这些钱我单独存在箱子的秘密角落里，那是谁也找不出来的，就算找到，也不能打开，除非是把箱子劈成碎片。

船现在开始挤满了人。好几个搭客上船来，他们并不是犯人，在大舱和船上别的位置给他们预先安排好膳宿。我们，像一些犯人一样，却被扔在下面，我也不知道是什么地方。但是当我丈夫来到船上的时候，我就向水手长谈了谈，他最初在送信这件事上已向我暗示出他的友谊了。我对他说他在许多事情上帮我忙，我却未曾有个相当的报答，说着这句话，我放一个金币在他手里。我告诉他，我丈夫现在来到船上了，虽然我俩现在都处在不幸的地位，但是过去我们是和这次一起来的那班可怜虫大不相同的人物，想问问他，船主会不会感动得允许我们在船上得到一些方便。船主要我们什么报酬，我们都可以答应，他自己如替我们去恳求，我们也会使他满意，给他辛苦的报酬。我看得出，他很满意地拿了那块金币，请我相信他会极力帮忙。

他于是对我说，他深信船主是世界上脾气最好的人，会很容易就答应我们的要求，给我们各种方便，为了叫我放心，还告诉我下次潮来的时候，他将特意到船主那里去谈这件事。第二天早上，偶然醒得比通常迟些，当我起来四下观望的时候，我看见水手长在人群里做他日常的事情。看到他，我有一点悲哀，正要走上前和他说话的时候，他看见我了，就向我走来，但是还未等他说话，我微笑着先说道：“我恐怕，先生，你忘记我们了，因为我看你很忙。”他立刻答道：“跟我来，我替你办。”他就带我到大舱去，那里坐着一位在水手里总算是文雅的先生，正在写字，面前堆了许多纸。

“这位，”水手长对这个写字的人说，“就是船主对你说的那个太太。”转过身来，他对我说道：“我并没有忘记你的事情，我已经到船主家里，忠实地向他报告了你所说的话，让你和你丈夫得到更好的待遇。船主派这位先生，船里的大副来，特意安排好一切，使你能够得到完全满意的膳宿，叫我请你相信你不会受一般流犯的那种待遇，倒会像其他旅客一样受到恭敬的款待。”

我还来不及感谢水手长的盛意，大副就说话了。他立刻证实水手长所说的话，还说那是船主的意思，表示出他的厚意同仁慈，尤其对于那些遭遇不幸的人们。说着这话，他指给我看几间另外盖起的房舱，有的在大舱间里，有的是用隔板和下等客舱隔开，但是门是向大舱间开的，这是为着旅客的方便，他让我随便挑选我喜欢的地方。然而，我挑了一间门向下等房舱开的房子，因为那里很宜于安置我们的箱子同匣子，还可以放一个桌子吃东西时用。

大副然后告诉我，水手长对于我们的为人极为夸奖，他奉命告诉我，假使我们觉得合适的话，我们整个旅程可以和他一起用餐，也是照通常旅客那样计算。如果我们愿意的话，我们还可以预备新鲜食物，否则，他可以替我们买，我们可以分吃他的食物。在我最近经过了这么多困苦之后，这对于我是非常振奋的消息。我感谢他，告诉他船主对于我们应该定下价目，请他让我把这件事情去通知我丈夫，他不大舒服，还没有走出他的小房间。我于是去了，我丈夫的精神是因为（他所认为的）所受的耻辱而颓丧，还没有恢复过来。一听到我说出我们在船上将受何种的待遇，他就兴奋起来，简直是另一个人了，新的活力同新的勇气表现在他的脸上。那的确是真的，最有气魄的人们，被患难所压倒的时候，也会陷于最大的沉闷同最大的失望，因此束手待毙的。

停了一会儿，他精神恢复后，就同我一起上去，感谢大副对我们这番厚意，还请他代向船主致意，我们愿意先付款，不管我们的船费同我们得到的种种方便需要多少钱。大副告诉他，船主将在下午上船，这些事都等他来了的时候再办。下午船主果然来了，我们看出他真是水手长所说的那么一个殷勤有礼的人。他喜欢我丈夫的谈吐，总之，他不让我们住我们所挑的房子，却给我们一间我前面说过的门向大舱间开的房子。

他的条件也并不苛刻，这个人并没有渴想敲我们的竹杠，却只要十五金币，就可以把船费，伙食，舱位全包括在内，我们和船主同桌用餐，受到很客气的招待。

船主自己住在大舱间的另一部分，因为他把他的圆舱租给一位有钱的垦荒者同他的妻子和三个小孩，他们自己另自用餐。他还有几个普通搭客，他们住在下等客舱里。至于我们的老同伴，当船停在那里的时候，全被关在舱口底下了，以后也很少走上甲板。

我不得不把这些经过全告诉我的保姆。她对我太关心了，真该分享我的喜悦。而且，我要她帮我买几件必需品，从前我不好意思叫别人知道我有那些东西，因为那是不宜于公开的。但是现在我有一个小房间同一个客舱可以放东西，我买了许多好东西，可以使我们的旅途舒适，像白兰地、糖、柠檬等，那是用来做五味酒款待我们的恩人船主用的。还有一大堆预备途中吃喝的东西。此外一架大床铺和跟它相称的被褥。总之，我们决定在途中不要缺乏任何东西。

这些时候，我没有预备我们到了那里开始自称为垦荒者时所需要的家伙。我非常懂得那时候该需要什么东西的。尤其垦殖同盖屋子时所用的一切工具，和我们住家所用的一切家具，假使在那个地方买，必定要花一倍以上的价钱。

我同我保姆商量这一点，她去找船主，对他说她希望能够替她这两位不幸的表弟表妹（她是这样称呼我们的）想个办法，使我们到那地方的时候得到自由，于是同他谈起办法和条件来。这我在讲到时再仔细说。这样探了船主的口气之后，她告诉他，虽然我们不幸处在流配外地的境地，然而我们都有资本，可以在那里努力去工作，决定移殖到那里，做垦荒的人。船主慨然答应出力，告诉她这些事怎样着手容易，而且勤勉的人们一定能够恢复他们的财产。“太太，”他说，“在那地方这并不算是丢脸的事，在我看来即使比你表亲的情形更坏的人被送到那边去，只要他们到了那里，勤勉精明地干他们的事情，他们就有办法。”她然后问他我们应当带什么东西去，他像一个诚实又懂得事理的人，这样对她说：“太太，照他们流配的条件，你的表亲们首先该找到人把他们买来当奴隶，然后，用那个人的名义，他们可以随便干什么事。他们可以买已经开垦的田园，或者向当地政府买土地，随便在什么地方着手，这两种农场用公道的价钱都可以买到。”她请求他帮忙第一件事，他答应了，后来的确是忠实地做了。至于其他，他答应把我们介绍给那些能够替我们出主意，不会欺骗我们的人，这真是再好不过的了。

她然后问他有没有必要替我们预备一套垦殖用的工具同材料。他说：“有，绝对有这种必要。”她于是求他帮忙。她对他说她愿意替我们买一切有用的东西，不管出多少钱。他就开了一个很长的细单，上面都是垦拓者的必需品，照他说起来，大约要花八十或者一百金镑。总之，她很熟练地去买那些东西，仿佛她是一个弗吉尼亚老商人。不过我吩咐她照他所开的单子每种东西多买一份。

这些东西她用她自己的名义放在船上，得到船主签字的提货单，写明这提货单是由我丈夫去取的，后来又用她自己的名义把这些货物保险。所以无论发生什么事，出什么乱子，我们都预先防备好了。

我应当告诉你，我丈夫把他所有的一百零八个金镑的现金都交给她去购买这些东西，此外我还给她一大笔钱。所以我并没有花费我留在她手里的那些钱。我们购买了全部货物之后，还有将近二百金镑的现金，那对我们已经很够了。

在这种情形下，我很高兴，看到我们这么幸运地受到良好的待遇，心里的确很快乐。我们就从布格拜洞扬帆向格来维森得去，在那里船又停了十天，船主就不再下船了。在这里船主对我们很客气，那真是我们预料不到的，只要我们严肃地保证我们不会离开他，一定将平安地再回到船上，他一定准许我们上岸，换一换空气。他这样信任我们，我丈夫不胜感激，他出于感恩之情，对他说，他既不能报答这么大的恩惠，所以他不想接受这个盛意，而且船主为了他冒这么大的危险，他也于心不安。彼此互相礼让了一会儿之后，我给我丈夫一个钱袋，里面有八十金币，他就将它放在船主手里。“这里，船主，是我们的忠实保证金，假使我们在任何方面对你不忠实，这就是你的了。”这样交涉之后，我们才上岸去。

那位船主的确十分相信我们，因为既然这样预备好了在那边垦殖的工具，我们就不会愿意冒生命危险待在这里，还有假使我们被抓住了，是免不了一死的。总之，我们大家和船主同到岸上去，在格来维森得一起用餐。在那里我们非常高兴，住了一夜，就宿在我们用餐的那家店里，第二天早上很老实地和他同上船来。在这里我们买了十打好啤酒，别的酒，鸡鸭同其他我们想在船上用得着的东西。

我的保姆这些时候都同我们在一块儿，和我们一同转到丹兹，船主太太也是这样。我和我母亲分手还不如和她分手这么悲哀，我后来再也没有看到她了。到丹兹后三天，来了一阵好东风，我们于四月十号从那里扬帆。我们再也没有靠岸，一直等到在爱尔兰海滨被一阵凶猛的狂风赶着，我们在一个小海湾里，靠近一条河的入海地方抛锚。那条河的名字我记不起来了，但是他们说这条河是通里摩黎克的，是爱尔兰最大的河。

在这里，被坏天气耽搁了一些时候，船主还是像起先那样仁慈可亲，又带我们上岸去。他现在的确是为了我丈夫而这样做，因为我丈夫很经不起风波之苦，很不舒服，尤其在刮大风的时候。在这里我们又买了许多新鲜的食物，牛肉、猪肉、羊肉同鸡鸭，船主等着腌好五六桶牛肉，来增加我们船中食物的贮藏。我们在这里还没有过五天，天气转好了，来了一阵好风，我们又扬帆，四十二天之后安抵弗吉尼亚的海岸了。

当我们快近海岸的时候，船主叫我去和他谈谈，对我说从我的话里他知道我有几个亲戚在这地方，而且我也曾经到过这里，所以他想我知道他们处置流犯的办法。我告诉他我不知道，至于那地方的亲戚，我可以说，作为流犯，我决不去认他们。至于其他，完全由他来帮忙，因为他慨然地答应过我们。他对我说，我必得找到本地的人来买我们做奴隶，假使总督问起的话，他要向总督负责。我告诉他我们将照他所指导的去做。他于是带来一个垦荒者和他谈论购买这两个奴隶，我的丈夫和我，在那里我们被正式卖给他，和他一起上岸。船主和我们一同走，带我们到一家店里，到底是不是家酒店，我不知道，但是我在那里喝了一大杯五味酒，那是用红酒等做的，我们大家都很喜欢。过了一会儿，那个垦荒者给我们一张释放的证书，声明我们诚实地伺候过他，第二天早上我们已是自由人了，随便到我们爱去的任何地方。

因为替我们干了这件事，船主要我们买六千磅烟草给他，他说他应当缴这么多给雇船运货的人。我们立刻买给他，此外还送他二十个金币，他觉得非常满意。

有好几种理由使我不宜于在这里详细说出我们住在殖民地的事，就讲下面这些已经够了。我们进入颇陀马克大河，我们的船也是向那里驶的。我们起先打算住在那里，虽然后来我们的心又变了。

当我把我们一切货物运上岸，搁在了我们登岸时所租的一个带住房的村庄货栈里，然后我做的第一件要紧的事是去打听我母亲和兄弟（我认作丈夫的那个不幸的人，我前面已经详细说过了）的消息。稍稍一探问我就知道，某某太太，我的母亲，已经死了。我兄弟（也可以说我的丈夫）还活着，我自认我听了并不十分高兴。但是更坏的是，我听说他迁出他从前的住所，我和他一起过活的那块垦殖地，与他的一个儿子住在我们租的那间货栈附近的一块垦殖地上。

开头我有点惊慌，但是我既然大胆地相信他不认得我了，便十分放心，而且很想去看他一下，如果我能够看见他而又不被他瞧见的话。为了要干这件事，我打听出他住在哪个垦殖地，就与一个我雇来帮忙的女人，也就是我们所谓的女仆，向那个地方漫游，好像我只是想看看那地方的情形，随便四处观察似的。最后我走得那么近，看见他的住屋了。我问那女人这是谁的田地，她说这是某一位绅士的。她稍微向右边看了看，说道：“那就是这田地的主人，他父亲和他在一起。”

“他们叫什么名字？”我说。“我不知道那个老绅士叫什么名字，但是他儿子是叫汉筑胆，我相信他父亲的名字也是这个。”她说。你们假使有本领，肯定可以猜出，此时我的思想是被快乐和恐惧同时占据，因为我立刻知道这人不是别人，就是我跟那个父亲，我的兄弟，所生下的儿子。我没有戴面具，但是我用头巾遮住我的脸孔。我相信隔了二十多年，而且他绝没有料到我会到这里来，他一定不会认得我。但是我用不着费这么多心机，因为这位老绅士患了眼疾，看东西已经不大清楚了，只能够勉强走路，不会碰树或者跌到沟里。同我在一起的那个女人偶然把这件事告诉我，一点也不知道这对于我是多么重要。当他们走近我们时，我说：“他认识你吗，欧文太太（他们都这样称呼她）？”

“认识，”她说，“假使他听到我说话，他知道是我，但是他看不清我和任何人。”于是她向我说出他眼睛的情形，像我前面所说的。这使我觉得安全，我把头巾掀开，让他们从我身边走过。那是一件刺心的事情，一个母亲这样看到她自己的儿子——一个在良好环境里的风姿潇洒，和蔼可亲的少年绅士，却不敢向他坦白，不敢对他招呼。让读这本书的任何有孩子的母亲想一想这种情形，再想一下我是多么痛心地遏制住自己。我心里多么渴望拥抱他，俯在他身上哭一哭。当时我真以为我的肚肠要断了，我的脏腑动摇了，我不知道如何是好，正如我现在不知道怎样表达出那种苦痛一样。他走过去以后，我站着痴痴地望着，浑身发抖，老是望着他，一直到看不见了。然后坐在草地上，就是我看他踏过的地方，我好像只是坐下休息一下，但是我背转过来朝着他，脸向地面，哭着，吻他的脚踏过的土地。

我无法向那女人隐藏我的不安，她看出来了，以为我的身体不适，我也不得不假说她猜对了。她就劝我起来，因为草地是潮湿的、危险的，我就照她的话办，同她一起走开。

我在回去的途中，谈到这位绅士和他的儿子的时候，增加了一个新的悲哀。这个女人好像要讲一桩有趣的故事来替我解闷，开始对我说道：“这位绅士从前住的地方的邻人相传有一个很奇怪的故事。”

“什么？”我说。“哎呀，”她说，“这位老绅士年轻的时候，到英国去，同一个年轻姑娘发生爱情，一个罕见的绝代美人。他娶了她，带到这儿，和他母亲同住，她那时候还活着。他和这位太太在这里住了几年，”她继续说道，“跟她生了几个孩子，今天和他在一起的那位少年绅士就是其中的一个。但是不久之后，那个老太太，他的母亲，对她谈起自己从前在英国时的情形和那时的境遇，那都是很坏的，那个媳妇开始很惊愕，很不安。总之，再仔细考察一下，才知道那是无法否认的，这位老太太是她自己的母亲，所以她的儿子是他妻子的亲兄弟，这使全家都突然感到惶恐，把他们弄得很混乱，几乎将他们都毁了。那个年轻的女人不肯和他同住了，那个儿子，她的兄弟同丈夫，一时疯了。最后那个年轻的女人去了英国，人们再没有听到她的消息了。”

我听到这个故事以后怎样感动那是不难想象的，但是我的烦闷真是言语所不能形容的。我好像听了觉得惊奇，问她成千的问题，关于里面的细节，我看出她都知道得极清楚。最后，我开始问那家人的情形，那位老太太，指我的母亲，是怎样死去的，她怎样分配她的遗产。因为我母亲曾经很郑重地向我说过，她死的时候，她将替我办一些事情，把财产的一部分保留下来，假使我还活着，我总能够得到，安排得使她的儿子，我的兄弟和丈夫，无法作梗。她说她不大知道是如何分配的，但是她听人说过，我母亲留下一笔财产，也就是她的田地，给她的女儿，如果能有她的消息的话，不论在英国，或者其他地方。这个责任就由这个孙子担负，就是我们看见和他父亲一起的那个人。

这个消息太好了，不容我忽视，你们可以相信，我的心充满了成千的想头，想到我将走哪条路，何时和怎样露出我的真相，究竟我要不要把自己的真相露出。

这是一个我真没有本领去对付的难题，我也不知该怎么办才好。整天整夜这些念头沉重地压着我的心。我既不能睡觉，也没有心情谈话，所以我丈夫看出来了，很纳闷我为什么这样不舒服，尽量使我开心，但是都没有效力。他逼我告诉他为什么使我难受，我敷衍了过去，后来因为他不断向我询问，我才编造出一段话来，可是里面也有实在的事情。我告诉他，我心里难受，因为我看我们必定要迁个地方，改变我们垦荒的计划，因为假使我待在这个地方，我恐怕会被人们知道了。我母亲死后，有几个亲戚来过我们现在住的地方，我如不迁居，就免不了被他们知道，当我们处在目下这种境况的时候，在许多方面都是不便的。到底该怎样办，我不知道，但是这个使我烦闷、忧愁。

他赞成我的话，认为在我们那时所处的情形下我绝不宜于被任何人瞧破。所以他告诉我，他愿意迁移到这个国境里的任何地方，甚至于任何其他国境，全凭我的意思。但是现在我有另一个困难，那就是，假使我搬到任何一个其他殖民地，我离得太远，不能很好去探询我母亲给我留下什么财产。我又不能将我从前结婚的秘密向我新丈夫道破，简直连这个念头我都不敢有。我想，这是一个不堪讲述的故事，我也预料不出会有什么结果。但是要去寻根追底地打听我母亲给我的遗产，又免不了弄得那地方的人都知道我是何人和我目下的境遇。

我的这种烦恼持续了很长时间，这使我的丈夫很感不安。因为他看出我心里很烦闷，但是暗想我不对他坦白，没有让他知道我一切的忧愁。他常常说，他真不知道他干了什么，使我不敢把心事告诉他，如果是令我伤心和难过的事情，尤其应当向他说出。说实在的，他真该受我一切的信托，因为世上没有一个人比他更值得一个妻子的亲爱。但是这件事我真不知道怎样向他提起，也没有人可以述说，这个重压是我的心所不能担负的。因为不管人们怎样认为女性不能守秘密，可我的一生明显地证明这话是不对的，但是无论女性或男性，一个重要的秘密总该有一个推心置腹的人，一个密友，对他可以说出这个秘密的欢欣，或者愁闷。不管是喜是悲，否则那将变成双倍的愁苦压在心头，也许甚至变为不能忍受的愁苦。这句话的真实意义人类的经验可以证明。

也就是出于这种原因，常常有男人同女人，甚至在别的方面具有最伟大同最良好的性质的男人，发现自己在这一方面却很无能。不能够独自忍受一种私下的快乐或者私下的悲哀的重压，却被迫向人说出，甚至于只为着替自己发泄一下，使那个被重量压得难受的心松快一下。这也绝不是愚蠢和糊涂的表现。这些人，假使挣扎着来止住这个需要，就一定会在梦中说出，把秘密泄露了，不管是多么危险的，也没有顾到会被人听见。这种天性，有时必然强烈存在于那些犯了大罪的人那儿，尤其是暗地里杀了人的凶手的心里，他们不得不向人道破，虽然那结果必定使他们毁灭。那固然是真的，天理昭昭，他们不能逃出法网，但是上帝常常利用自然的能力，在这里也是靠着天生的冲动来产生这些奇异的效果。

我同罪恶和犯人相处很久，能够举出几个有意思的例子。我被关在新门的时候，有一个人，人们叫他夜飞人，我不知此后人们懂不懂这绰号是什么意思。看守人每夜都佯为不知地放他出去，他就弄他的把戏，使那些所谓老实的人们，捕役，有事可干，第二天就寻找他前晚上偷的东西送上去讨奖。这个汉子准会在梦里说出他干了什么，他的一切步骤，他偷了什么东西，从何处偷的，仿佛他醒着的时候曾经订过条约一样，好像梦里这么随便说都是没有危险的。所以平时他出去干事情之后，他必得自己锁在房里，或者他雇来的人们替他锁好，那么别人就不至于听到他的呓语了。可是他对任何同伴，任何伙计或者他的雇主，我可以这样叫那班捕役，讲出一切细节。原原本本地叙述他的夜游同成功之后，他就感到舒服了，和别人一样安静地睡着。

我这本传记的出版既然因为它处处含有教训，可以给读者以指导、警告和矫正，所以我希望这段关于人们不得不泄露他们自己的或者别人的最大秘密的文字，不会被看作是用不着的枝叶文章。

正在这么一种重压之下，我为着前面所说的那件事情受着折磨。我感到唯一的安慰是让我丈夫知道了这么多情形，使他相信我们的确有迁徙到别的地方去垦荒的必要。第二个摆在我们面前的问题是我们要到哪一部分的英国殖民地去。我的丈夫在那个国境里完全是一个生人，对于那里几个地方的位置简直连普通的地理知识都没有。我，在我写这自传之前不晓得什么叫作地理，也只有一些普通的知识，那是从到过好几个地方的人们口里听来的。但是我知道马里兰、宾夕法尼亚、纽约、新英格兰都是在弗吉尼亚之北，所以那里天气比较寒冷，因此我有些厌恶。我既是天生喜欢暖和的天气，现在年纪大了，对于寒冷的气候更是想躲避。我于是想到卡罗来纳，那是美洲南部唯一的英国殖民地，我就提议到那里去。尤其因为我可以更容易地随时从那里回来。当打听我母亲的遗产的时机到了的时候，我可以当然地宣布自己是谁，去索讨这份遗产。有了这么一种决心，我向我丈夫提议我们从那时所住的地方搬走，带着我们一切财产到卡罗来纳去，我们将来就在那儿住下。我丈夫很快就赞成这个提议，那就是说，我们不宜待在这儿，因为我已经说得他相信，我们在这里一定会被人瞧破，至于其他理由我完全隐瞒不让他知道。

但是我看出有一个新难题搁在我心上。那件要紧的事情还是沉沉地压着我的心，我没有多少打听出一点我母亲留给我的那些财产的情形，绝不能离开这儿。我也绝不能忍心走去，而没有使我的丈夫（兄弟），或者我的孩子（他的儿子）知道我来了。但是我想办好这件事，不让我的新丈夫知道，也不让他们知道有他这个人，或者我现在是一个有丈夫的女人。

我心里想了无数的办法，怎样才能把这件事办好。我会很高兴，如果能叫我丈夫带着所有的货物先去，然后我再单独去。但是这是办不到的。他完全不了解美洲的情形，也不知道在那里或者任何其他地方怎样安顿一切，所以他不和我一起，是绝不肯动身的。然后我想我俩可以先带着一部分货物去，当我们安置停当后，我再回到弗吉尼亚，取剩下的货物。但是就是那时候，我知道，他也不愿和我分手，留下来独自在那里经营。这里面的理由是很分明的，他受过绅士式的教养，所以不单是不懂许多平常的事情，而且懒惰，当我们住下之后，他一定愿意背了枪到森林去，当地人叫打猎，是本地土人常干的事情，他们当人们的仆役，替人们去打鸟兽。我说，他倒愿意干这类事情，而不肯照料他的垦殖地上的事务。

所以这些是无法克服的困难，我不知道如何去对付。我心中这么强烈地想向我的兄弟，我从前的丈夫，说破，我实在不能够制止住这些想法。尤其因为我常常暗暗地忧虑，假使我不在他活着的时候说破，我以后也许绝无法叫我的儿子相信我的确是本人，是他的母亲，那么既失掉了母子关系所具有的互助和安慰，也得不到我母亲留给我的好处了。然而，从另一方面说来，当我处于既有丈夫又是罪人的情况下，我绝没有认为跑去和他们相见是妥当的办法。因此，我先从现在住的地方迁去是绝对必要的，然后再来找他，好像是从别个地方来的，也没有带着这股寒碜样子。

这样考虑之后，我继续对我的丈夫说我们绝对有离开颇陀马克的必要，因为至少我们可以避免被公众立即看破。假使我们到这个世界里的任何其他地方，我们进去时可以很荣耀，好像其他来那里垦荒的家庭一样。居民总是愿意有一家人到他们那里去垦荒，因为这家人带来了资本，买下开垦的土地或动手新辟一块，所以我们到处都有把握会受到和蔼可亲的欢迎．而且绝没有发现我们来时的情况的可能。

我含糊地告诉他，我有几个亲戚住在我们现在滞留的这个地方，我现在不敢让他们知道我在这儿，因为他们会很快探听出我来到这里的缘由，那将把我过去的一切都泄露了。可是，我又有理由相信我母亲，她死在这儿，留下一些财产给我，也许是很不少的，是很值得我去打听一下的。但是不暴露自己也不能办到这一点，除非我们从这儿走开。然后，不管我们在什么地方安下家，我可以到这儿来，好像是拜望我的兄弟同侄子，告诉他们我是什么人，打听并要求拿到我所应得的财产，受人们恭敬的招待，同时让人们高兴地好意地使我得到公平。反过来说，假使我现在就下手，我不能期望别的，只能是麻烦，比如用强力去争，人们诅咒地万分不情愿地给我，还加上种种的侮辱，那也许是他所不忍看的。假使要我用法律手续来证明我的确是她的女儿，我也许不知所措，不得不求助于英国，可能最后会失败，因此失掉了那份遗产，不管那有多少。用了这些理由，再把有必要让他知道的那一部分秘密向他倾告，我们就决定去别的殖民地找一个安身之地，一开头我们就拣卡罗来纳这个地方。

为要迁到那里去，我们开始着手打听往卡罗来纳去的船只，在很短时间之内就打听到了。在海湾的那一边，就是指马里兰，有一条从卡罗来纳来的船，运来谷类和别的货物，再载着粮食返回那里，然后向牙买加出发。听到这个消息，我们就雇了一艘单桅帆船，装上我们的货物，好像是跟颇陀马克河永诀似的，带着我们所有的东西向马里兰驶去。

这是一个悠长而不舒服的旅程，我丈夫说这比从英国来这里的旅程坏得多，因为天气不好，波浪又大，我们的船又小又不方便。再说，我们沿颇陀马克河上行整整走了一百里，经过西马里兰郡，那条河是弗吉尼亚最大的河。我还听人们说这是世界上最大的内陆河，我们又碰到坏天气，所以常常遇到很大的危险。因为虽然人们把它叫作一条河，但它实在是太宽了，当我们驶到中间的时候，我们望不见两岸，一连好几里都是这样。然后我们还得横渡折撒比克河，也可以叫作海湾，这就是颇陀马克河所注入的，差不多有三十里宽。我们还驶进更辽阔的河流，它们的名字我不知道。所以我们乘一个可怜渺小的单桅帆船，带着我们所有的宝贝整整走了二百里的旅程，一旦遇险，我们会变得穷困，假如我们失掉了一切货物，光救出自己的生命来，赤身空手地待在一个野蛮的异地，在那一个世界里一个朋友或者相识的人都没有——单是这样一想就够使我惶恐，甚至于当那危险已经过去之后。

五天的航行之后我们到了那个地方，我想叫作腓力角。你们瞧，当我们安抵那里时，往卡罗来纳去的船刚好于三天前装了货出发了，我们很失望。但是既然任何事都不能叫我灰心，我就向我丈夫说，我们既不能坐船到卡罗来纳去，我们现在流寓的这个地方土壤也很肥沃，假使他愿意的话，我们就可以留下来。看一看我们在这儿有没有什么发展的可能，假使他觉得都还满意，我们就在这里住下。

我们立刻上岸去，但是在那地方找不到合适的房子给我们自己住并安顿我们的货物，却碰到一个很诚实的教友派教徒，他指点我们往东走六十里左右，那就是说，更近海湾的地方。他说他住在那儿，我们到那个地方可以得到很好的待遇。在那里垦荒也可以，或者等着机会往更方便的地方去垦荒也可以。他这么好意地，这么真挚地请我们去，我们就答应了，这位教徒也和我们一道去了。

在那里我们买了两个奴隶，一个是从由利物浦来的船上刚上岸的英国女人，还有一个是男黑奴，凡是自命在那里垦荒的人们都该有这两种人。这位诚实的教友派教徒很帮我们的忙，当我们来到他告诉我们的那个地方的时候，他替我们找到一家方便的栈房安置我们的货物，还有一所房子给我们和仆人住。大约两个月之后，听他的话，我们向本地官厅购到一大片地，做我们垦荒的基础。所以我们把到卡罗来纳去的念头完全搁在一边了，因为我们在这儿享受到很好的待遇，有一所方便的房子，直住到我们能够预备好一切东西，土地也开拓得够用，有木头和其他材料可以盖新房子。这些事我们都是照这位教友派教徒的话去做的，所以在一年之内，我们已经开拓了将近五十平方里的田地，有一部分已经筑起藩篱，有些栽上了烟草，虽然并不多。此外，我们还有园地和麦田，足够供给我们仆人的生菜和面包。

现在我劝我丈夫让我重渡海湾，去探问我的朋友们。他现在比较愿意答应我去，因为他手边有许多事情够他忙碌，还有他的枪给他消遣，他们那里叫作打猎，他是很喜欢干的。真的，我们常常彼此相视，有时心里感到非常高兴，想起现在的情形远远胜过以前的日子，不单是新门监狱里的生活，甚至于我们两人所干的那种坏生意里最兴旺的时候。

我们的事情很顺利。我们用三十五金镑现钱向本地官府所购买的土地足够五六十个仆人去耕种。这块地好好料理之后，能够使我们在世的时候衣食无忧。至于儿女，我是已经没有生产的希望了。

但是我们的幸运还不止于此。我，像前面所说的，渡过海湾，到了我兄弟，我从前的丈夫住的地方。但是我没到我从前待过的那个乡村，却顺着另一条大河上行，那是在颇陀马克河的左边，叫作拉帕罕诺克河，这样到了他们的拓荒地的后面。他的地有一大片，我顺一条流入拉帕罕诺克河的小湾航行，也可说是小河，就到达了他住宅的附近。

我现在已经决定直接地去见我的兄弟（丈夫），告诉他我是谁。但是不知道见到他时他的心情如何，也可以说不知道这么鲁莽地来访问会叫他显出如何的不高兴，我决意写一封信给他，让他知道我是谁，并让他知道我不是为着从前的关系再来跟他麻烦。我希望那种关系彼此都已经全部忘掉了，我现在却是以一个姊妹向兄弟说话的资格来请他帮忙，使我能得到我母亲死时留给我的财产。我相信他一定会公平地交给我，尤其想到我这么老远地来接受这份遗产。

在这封信里，关于他的儿子，我说了几句很动情、很慈爱的话，我对他说他知道这是我亲生的儿子。我嫁给他，既然同他娶我一样地无罪，那时我们都不晓得彼此有血统的关系，所以我希望他让我满足我的最热烈的愿望，就是看一下我唯一的儿子，表示一个母亲的慈爱。她对儿子老是保存着强烈的感情，而这个儿子却绝不能记得我了。

我相信得到这一封信，他会立刻让他儿子念出来，因为我听说他眼睛看不清东西，瞧不见字。但是结果比我所预测的还好，因为他眼力既然不强，他让他儿子打开一切写给他的信。当我派送信的人到那里的时候，这位老绅士刚好不在家，也许是在家里僻静的地方，我的信就直接落到他儿子手里，他就打开来念。

过了一会儿，他叫送信的人进来，问他给他这封信的那个人住在哪里。送信人告诉他在什么地方，那差不多有七里路的距离。他于是叫他停一会儿，吩咐预备一匹马，两个仆人，他就同送信人来找我了。当送信人回来，告诉我老绅士出门了，但是他的儿子和他同来了，现在正要进来见我的时候，我有何等的惊慌，大家是可以想象的。我完全糊涂了，因为我不知道这是战争，还是和平，我也不知道怎么办好。然而，我只有一点时间供我思虑，因为我儿子就在送信人的后头，走进我房子时，在门口问那送信人一些话。我没有听清楚，但是我猜想一定是问哪个是派他送信的那位太太。因为送信人说道：“她在那里，先生。”听到这句话，他一直走到我面前，吻着我，用他的双臂抱着我，这么热情地抱我，他简直说不出话来了，但是我能够感觉到他的胸膛起伏着，像一个呜咽而哭不出声的孩子。

我既不能说出，也不能描述我灵魂深处所感到的欢欣，当我看出，那是容易看出的，他不像一个生人，却像一个儿子来到母亲身边，的确像一个素来不知道母亲是什么样子的儿子。总之，我们对哭了很久，最后他开口道：“我亲爱的母亲，你还活着吗？我绝没有预料还能见你的面。”至于我，有好半天说不出一句话来。

我们两个精神恢复，能够说话之后，我就告诉他我目下的情形。至于我写给他父亲的信，他告诉我他还没有给他父亲，也没有对他提起这件事。他祖母留给我的东西都在他手里，他将使我心满意足地得到一个公平待遇。至于他的父亲，他身心已经衰老，他很容易生气，脾气很躁，差不多瞎了，什么也不能做，他怀疑他父亲能否处置这么难于下手的一件事情。所以他自己先来了，也是满足自己想见我的欲望，这是他无法自制的，一面让我知道这些情形后，再决定我向不向他父亲说破我是谁。

这件事办得很谨慎，很聪明，我看出我的儿子是个明白人，用不着我的吩咐。我对他说我并不奇怪他父亲成了他所说的样子，因为在我离开他之前，他的头脑受了些打击。他的烦闷大半是因为在我知道他是我兄弟之后，我不肯隐起我们的血缘关系，当他的妻子同住着。他既然比我更了解他父亲现在的情形，我自然赞成他所提的办法。见不见他的父亲对我倒没关系，因为我已经见到了他。他告诉我他祖母留给我的财产寄存在他手里，这是他给我的再好不过的消息了。我相信他现在既然知道我是谁，一定会像他所说的给我一个公平。我然后问我母亲死了多久，死在什么地方，讲出这么多关于家庭里的零星细事，使他毫不怀疑我当真是他的母亲。

我的儿子然后问我住在哪儿，怎样安顿的。我告诉他我住在海湾那边马里兰，在一位和我同船由英国来的朋友的垦荒地上。至于海湾这边的地方，我却没有住所。他对我说，假使我愿意，我可以同他一起回家，活在世上的时候跟他在一块儿。至于他的父亲，他已不认得任何人了，简直不会猜出我是谁。我考虑了一会儿，告诉他道，虽然我不一定要住在离他很远的地方，但是和他同住在一所房里，这个不欢的对象老在我眼前。而且从前给过我那么大的打击，我总不能说这是世上最愉快的事情。虽然我很高兴同他（我的儿子）一起过日子，当我待在这儿的时候，能够同他非常接近，但是我不能住在这样一个家里，在那儿我得时刻防备自己，怕的是说话时露出马脚来。我也免不了在谈话里会讲出一些话，比如叫他作我的儿子，那将揭破全部的秘密，是绝对不方便的。

他承认我的意见全是对的。“但是，亲爱的母亲，”他说，“请你在可能范围内住在最近的地方。”他就抱我和他同骑一匹马，到他邻近一块垦荒地，在那里我会得到像在他自己田地里同样好的待遇。他留我在那里，告诉我明天我们一定谈主要的事情，说完他就回去了。他暂时叫我作他的姑母，命令那里的人，他们好像是他的佃户，尽力恭敬地看待我。他去后两个钟头，便送了一个女仆同一个小黑奴来伺候我，还有已经煮好的吃的东西。这样我仿佛到了一个新的世界，我现在开始暗暗地庆幸我没有把我那个兰开夏丈夫从英国带来。

然而这个希望也是很热烈的，因为我全心都爱着我这个兰开夏丈夫。我的确一开头就是这样子的。他也值得我这么爱恋，世上不能有人比他更值得女人爱了，但是这都是题外的话。

第二天，我一起身，我的儿子就来看我。谈了一会儿，他就掏出一个鹿皮钱袋，里面有五十五个西班牙金币，连袋子一起给我，对我说这是补足我从英国来一路用去的旅费，因为虽然他不该探问，但是他应当顾虑到我没有带很多钱来。人们带一大堆钱来到这个地方，那是少有的事。然后，他拿出他祖母的遗嘱，念给我听，里面说她留下一块小垦殖地给我，那是在约克河旁边，就是我母亲住的地方，连同那块地上的奴隶和牲口，托我这个儿子交给我，无论何时他听到我还活着的消息。再后来就给我的继承人，如果我生有儿女的话。如果没有，就给我遗嘱上写明接受我财产的人。但是在没有听到我的消息，或者找不到我之前，这块地每年的收入就归于我那个儿子。假使我已经不在人间了，那么这就归他和他的继承人。

这块地，虽然离他住的地方很远，他说他并没有租出去，却叫一个管家去料理，那块地邻近属于他父亲的一块，他也是这样办的，他每年到那里视察三四回。我问他那块地值多少钱，他说，假使我租出去，他每年可以给我六十金镑。但是假使我自己住在里面，那么就更值钱了，他相信每年可以有一百五十金镑的收入。但是看到我有意在海湾的那一边住下，也许还想回英国去，假使我让他当我的管家，他将替我料理，像替他自己料理一样，他相信他每年可以送值一百金镑的烟草到英国给我，有时还可以多些。

这对于我都是不常遇到的奇怪的新闻。我的心的确比以前更严肃地向上望着，很感恩地看着上帝的手，他为我带来这么多奇的幸运，而我自己也许是世上顶坏的人。我不得不再说一下，不单是这一次，甚至于在每次感恩的时候，当我觉得上帝赐福于我，而我却这么不善于报答，我就深深地感到我过去罪恶的生涯是没人心的，我非常厌恶，深深地责备我自己为什么有这样一种过去。

但是我让读者去想这里面所含的教训，他们必定可以明白。我还是继续叙述事实吧。我儿子的亲切态度同慷慨的提议使我落泪，他那回同我谈话时我几乎一直是这样。真的，我只能在感情伏下去的时候向他说话。最后，我开始讲话了，说我很纳闷我运气会这么好，留给我的遗产会托付在他手里。我又说，至于这份遗产的继承，我在世上除了他以外没有别的儿女，就是再嫁，已过了生小孩的时期了，所以我请他写下一张文件，里面说清我死后这份财产完全传给他同他的后裔，我很愿意这样办。当时我笑着问他为什么这么大还是个单身汉。他的回答又快又合理，他说弗吉尼亚没有很多可以做妻子的姑娘，我既然说要回到英国去，我可以从伦敦送来一个妻子给他。

这是我们第一天谈话的内容，这是我一生所遇到的最快乐的一天，这天我感到了真正的满足。此后他天天来，大半的时间都同我在一起，带我到他几个朋友的家里，在那里我受到很尊敬的款待。我在他家里也吃了好几顿饭，那时他总设法把他那半死的父亲弄到外面去，使我们彼此不能相见。我送他一件东西，这是我唯一值钱的东西，那是一只金表，我前面不是已经说过我箱里有两只吗，这一只我刚好带在身边，他第三次来看我的时候我就送给他了。我对他说我没有什么别的值钱东西给他，我希望他常常为我的缘故吻这只表。我没有告诉他这是我在伦敦一个会场上从一位太太身上偷来的。这也是题外的话。

他站着迟疑了一会儿，仿佛不知道该不该接受。但是我逼着他，要他拿去。这只表的价值并不低于他那满皮袋的西班牙金币，就是在伦敦估价，也不下于他的赠品。而在那地方，我送给他的那个地方，这表要值双倍的价钱。最后他拿了，吻着，对我说这只表在他眼里将是一笔债，我在世之日，他会一直还这笔债。

过了几天，他带来我把产业传给他的文件，还有代书文件的人，我很高兴地签了字，吻了一百下，然后把这文件交给他。因为真的，一个母亲同一个亲爱孝顺的儿子之间从没有更真情地传受过东西。第二天他带来给我他亲笔签字的，盖过图章的一张契约，里面载明他将尽力替我料理经管那块垦殖地，照我的命令寄钱给我，无论我在什么地方，而且，他负责每年凑成一百金镑。他签好了字后对我说，因为我是在秋收之前来要这块土地的，所以我有享受今年收成的权利，于是他就付我一百金镑的西班牙金币，请我给他一张收据，说今年的款已付清，一直到这个圣诞节止。那时正是八月下旬。

我在这儿待了五个星期左右，的确很舍不得离开。他要送我到海湾那边，但是我绝不肯让他过去。然而，他要用他自己的单桅帆船送我，那只船造得像一只快艇，既可以算作正式的船，又可以当作游船。我答应了，于是在表示出敬意和感情之后，他让我离开，航行了两天，我安抵我的朋友，那个教友派教徒的地方。

我带回去三匹马以及马具同马鞍，几头猪，两头牛，还有成千件别的东西，以备我们垦荒之用，这都是世上女人所难得的最孝顺，最会承意的儿子的礼物。我告诉我丈夫这次旅行的一切经过，只是把我儿子说成侄儿。起先我告诉他我失掉了我的金表，他好像认为这是一件不幸的事，然后我告诉他我的侄儿多么殷勤，我母亲留下一块垦殖地给我，他替我保管着，希望有个时候会听到我的消息，然后我说我让他去管理，他将忠实地报告我每年的收成。然后我掏出那一百金镑的西班牙钱币给他看，说这是第一年的出产品的钱。然后掏出那一鹿皮袋子的金币，“这，我亲爱的，”我说，“就是那金表的代价。”我的丈夫——可见凡是仁爱感动了人心的时候，上帝的恩惠在一切明白的人们心里都会生出同样的效力——高高地举起他的双手，狂欢地说道：“呀！上帝这样赐福于一条像我这样忘恩的狗！”然后我让他知道除这些东西之外单桅帆船里还载有什么东西，我指的是马匹、猪、牛，同一切垦荒用的家伙。这一切增加了他的惊奇，使他的心充满了感谢。我相信从那时候起他是个诚实的忏悔者，一个完全改过自新的人，上帝的恩惠从来没有使一个强盗，一个窃贼，一个放荡的人变得比他更好。我能写一本比这本更厚的记录，说出许多证据来证明这句话，但是我怀疑那些事情不能像作恶那么有趣，我打算另外写成一本。

这本书既然是我的自传，而不是我丈夫的，那我还是回过来说关于我自己的事情吧。我们继续垦荒，料理田地，我们殷勤的态度使我们在那里交到许多朋友。他们帮助我们，为我们解闷，尤其那位老实的教友派教徒，他始终是我们忠心的，慷慨的以及靠得住的朋友！我们很成功，因为像我前面所说的，我们一开头有一笔丰富的资本，现在又加上了一百五十金镑的现钱，我们增加了仆役，盖起一座很好的屋子，当年新开拓了许多土地。第二天，我写信给我的老保姆，让她分享我们的欢乐，并且吩咐她怎样处置我留在她那儿的那笔钱。那一共有二百五十金镑，像我上面所说的，叫她用这笔钱买货物运来，她就像她通常那样殷勤地，忠实地做了这件事，这些货物安全地到了我们手里。

我们这下子得到了一批衣服，我丈夫的和我自己的。我尤其设法给他买了一切我知道他所喜欢的东西。比如两条好材料的长假发，两把银柄的剑，三四杆漂亮的鸟枪，一只精致的马鞍，很好看的手枪和皮套子，还有一件红袍。总之，一切我能想得到的使他开心的，以及能显出他是位英姿潇洒的绅士的东西。我还订了我们缺少的许多家庭用具和我们自己穿的各种布匹。至于我自己，我只要很少的布匹，因为我所藏的已是不少了。我其余的货物是各种铁器，马具，农具，仆人穿的衣服，羊毛衣服料子，布呢，哔叽，袜子，鞋子，帽子，同其他仆人用的东西。还有整匹给仆人做衣服用的料子，这都是按照那位教友派教徒的指点订的。这许多货物都安全地运到那里，还有三个女仆，都是强壮的姑娘，是我老保姆替我挑选的，宜于那地方和我们要她们干的事情。有一个是怀着胎来的，当船还没有驶到格来维森得，她已经同船里一个水手种下这个胎儿了，这是她后来自认的话！于是在她上岸七个月之后，给我们生下一个强健的男孩。

你们可以猜到，我丈夫看见从英国运来了这么多货物有多吃惊！看到账单以后，他对我说道：“我亲爱的，这是什么意思？我恐怕你会使我们负债太多。什么时候我们才能够还清这么多钱呢？”我微笑着说这些全都付过了。然后我告诉他，因为不知道在旅程中我们会不会碰到什么灾难，又想到我们的境况使我们不能保护自己的财产，我就留下这些钱在我朋友手里。现在我们既已安抵这里，已经弄妥了一切预备久居，我就叫她送他现在所看见的这些货物来。

他深为惊讶，站着默默地屈指计算了一会儿。然后他这样开始说道“：不忙，让我算一算。”然后按着指头算，先按他的大拇指说道：“开头有二百四十六金镑现钱，然后两个金表，钻石戒指，金银器皿，”说着按着食指，然后按着中指，“约克河边一块垦殖地，每年有一百金镑的收入，然后一百五十金镑现钱，然后装了整整一只单桅帆船的马，牛，猪，还有货物。”于是又算到大拇指了。“现在，”他说，“一批在英国值二百五十金镑，在这里值双倍价钱的货物。”

“好吧，”我说，“你这样算有什么用？”

“什么用？”他说，“哎呀，当我在兰开夏娶了一个妻子的时候，谁敢说我是受骗了？我以为我娶的是一个拥有厚资的人，而事实上我的确是娶了一个很有钱的姑娘。”

总而言之，我们现在的境况非常富裕，而且每年有进步。我们新开垦的地不知不觉地加多起来，我们在那里住了八年后，我们每年的出产最少值三百金镑现钱，我指的是在英国可以值这么多。

我在家住了一年之后，我又渡海去看我的儿子，并收我垦殖地第二年的进款。我一上岸就惊奇地听到我以前的丈夫已经死了，埋葬不到两星期。我自认，这并不是个令人不愉快的消息，因为现在我可以不必隐瞒我的真实情形，说我有一个丈夫了。所以在我离开我儿子之前，我告诉他我相信我将嫁给一位在我邻近有一块垦殖地的绅士！虽然我从前结过婚，但是按法律我是可以随意嫁人的。只是我觉得不好意思，害怕那个污点会被重新点明，也许会使一个丈夫不安。我的儿子，还像一向那么一个亲爱，孝顺，善于承意的人，现在请我在他自己家里住，付我那一百镑，又是使我满载了赠品而归。

过了不久，我让我儿子知道我结婚了，请他过来看我们。我丈夫也写了一封很客气的信给他，请他过来看他。几个月之后，他来了，刚好那时我的货从英国来到，我使他相信这都是属于我丈夫的财产，不是我的。

我必定要说当那个年老的可怜人，我的兄弟（丈夫）死了的时候，我坦白地向我丈夫说出了那一切经过，还说我那所谓的侄儿就是这不幸的错误姻缘所生的儿子。对于这点，他完全没有不高兴，他说假使那个老人还活着的话，他也不会不高兴。“因为，”他说，“这不是你的错误，也不是他的错误，这是个无法防止的谬误。”他只怪当我知道他是我的兄弟之后他还要我瞒着这事，继续做他的妻子同居。他说，这一点是罪恶。这样一切难关都过去了，我们再舒服不过地，彼此极端恩爱地一同过活。我们现在都老了，我回到英国来，差不多七十岁了，我的丈夫六十八岁，我已经早过了流配的期间限。虽然经过了这么多困苦艰难，现在，我们两个却都身心俱健。我丈夫在我回来后还在那里逗留了相当时候，安排我们的事情。起先我想回去找他，但是照他的意思我改了主意，他也回到英国来了。我们决定在英国过我们的余生，诚恳地忏悔我们的罪恶生涯。

AUTHOR’S PREFACE


The world is so taken up of late with novels and romances, that it will be hard for a private history to be taken for genuine, where the names and other circumstances of the person are concealed; and on this account we must be content to leave the reader to pass his own opinion upon the ensuing sheets, and take it just as he pleases.

The author is here supposed to be writing her own history, and in the very beginning of her account she gives the reasons why she thinks fit to conceal her true name, after which there is no occasion to say any more about that.

It is true that the original of this story is put into new words, and the style of the famous lady we here speak of, is a little altered, particularly she is made to tell her own tale in modester words than she told it at first; the copy which came first to hand having been written in language more like one still in Newgate, than one grown penitent and humble, as she afterwards pretends to be.

The pen employed in finishing her story, and making it what you now see it to be, has had no little difficulty to put it into a dress fit to be seen, and to make it speak language fit to be read: When a woman debauched from her youth, nay, even being the offspring of debauchery and vice, comes to give an account of all her vicious practices, and even to descend to the particular occasions and circumstances by which she first became wicked, and of all the progressions of crime which she run through in threescore years, an author must be hard put to it to wrap it up so clean as not to give room, especially for vicious readers, to turn it to his disadvantage.

All possible care, however, has been taken to give no lewd ideas, no immodest turns in the new dressing up of this story, no, not to the worst part of her expressions; to this purpose some of the vicious part of her life, which could not be modestly told, is quite left out, and several other parts are very much shortened; what is left ’tis hoped will not offend the chastest reader, or the modestest hearer; and as the best use is to be made even of the worst story, the moral ’tis hoped will keep the reader serious, even where the story might incline him to be otherwise;to give the history of a wicked life repented of, necessarily requires that the wicked part should be made as wicked as the real history of it will bear, to illustrate and give a beauty to the penitent part, which is certainly the best and brightest, if related with equal spirit and life.

It is suggested there cannot be the same life, the same brightness and beauty in relating the penitent part, as is in the criminal part: if there is any truth in that suggestion. I must be allowed to say, ’tis because there is not the same taste and relish in the reading; and indeed it is too true that the difference lies not in the real worth of the subject so much as in the gust and palate of the reader.

But as this work is chiefly recommended to those who know how to read it, and how to make the good uses of it which the story all along recommends to them; so it is to be hoped that such readers will be much more pleased with the moral than the fable, with the application than with the relation, and with the end of the writer than with the life of the person written of.

There is in this story abundance of delightful incidents, and all of them usefully applied. There is an agreeable turn artfully given them in the relating, that naturally instructs the reader, either one way or another. The first part of her lewd life with the young gentleman at Colchester, has so many happy turns given it to expose the crime, and warn all whose circumstances are adapted to it, of the ruinous end of such things, and the foolish, thoughtless, and abhorred conduct of both the parties, that it abundantly atones for all the lively description she gives of her folly and wickedness.

The repentance of her lover at the Bath, and how brought by the just alarm of his fit of sickness to abandon her; the just caution given there against even the lawful intimacies of the dearest friends, and how unable they are to preserve the most solemn resolutions of virtue without divine assistance; these are parts which to a just discernment will appear to have more real beauty in them, than all the amorous chain of story which introduces it.

In a word, as the whole relation is carefully garbled of all the levity and looseness that was in it: so it is applied, and with the utmost care, to virtuous and religious uses. None can without being guilty of manifest injustice, cast any reproach upon it, or upon our design in publishing it.

The advocates for the stage have in all ages made this the great argument to persuade people that their plays are useful, and that they ought to be allowed in the most civilized and in the most religious government, viz., that they are applied to virtuous purposes, and that, by the most lively representations, they fail not to recommend virtue and generous principles, and to discourage and expose all sorts of vice and corruption of manners; and were it true that they did so, and that they constantly adhered to that rule, as the test of their acting on the theatre, much might be said in their favour.

Throughout the infinite variety of this book this fundamental is most strictly adhered to; there is not a wicked action in any part of it but is first or last rendered unhappy and unfortunate; there is not a superlative villain brought upon the stage, but either he is brought to an unhappy end, or brought to be a penitent; there is not an ill thing mentioned but it is condemned, even in the relation, nor a virtuous just thing but it carries its praise along with it. What can more exactly answer the rule laid down, to recommend even those representations of things which have so many other just objections lying against them? Viz., of example of bad company, obscene language, and the like.

Upon this foundation this book is recommended to the reader, as a work from every part of which something may be learned, and some just and religious inference is drawn by which the reader will have something of instruction, if he pleases to make use of it.

All the exploits of this lady of fame, in her depredations upon mankind, stand as so many warnings to honest people to beware of them, intimating to them by what methods innocent people are drawn in, plundered, and robbed, and by consequence how to avoid them. Her robbing a little child, dressed fine by the vanity of the mother, to go to the dancing school, is a good memento to such people hereafter; as is likewise her picking the gold watch from the young lady’s side in the park.

Her getting a parcel from a hairbrained wench at the coaches in St. John’s Street; her booty at the fire, and also at Harwich; all give us excellent warning in such cases to be more present to ourselves in sudden surprises of every sort.

Her application to a sober life, and industrious management at last in Virginia, with her transported spouse, is a story fruitful of instruction to all the unfortunate creatures who are obliged to seek their re-establishment abroad, whether by the misery of transportation, or other disaster; letting them know that diligence and application have their due encouragement, even in the remotest part of the world, and that no case can be so low, so despicable, or so empty of prospect, but that an unwearied industry will go a great way to deliver us from it, will in time raise the meanest creature to appear again in the world, and give him a new cast for his life.

These are a few of the serious inferences which we are led by the hand to in this book, and these are fully sufficient to justify any man in recommending it to the world, and much more to justify the publication of it.

There are two of the most beautiful parts still behind, which this story gives some idea of, and lets us into the parts of them, but they are either of them too long to be brought into the same volume; and indeed are, as I may call them, whole volumes of themselves, viz., 1. the life of her governess, as she calls her, who had run through, it seems in a few years, all the eminent degrees of a gentlewoman, a whore, and a bawd;a midwife, and a midwife keeper, as they are called; a pawnbroker, a child-taker, a receiver of thieves, and of stolen goods; and in a word, herself a thief, a breeder up of thieves, and the like, and yet at last a penitent.

The second is the life of her transported husband, a highwayman;who it seems lived a twelve years’ life of successful villainy upon the road, and even at last came off so well as to be a volunteer transport, not a convict; and in whose life there is an incredible variety.

But, as I said, these are things too long to bring in here, so neither can I make a promise of their coming out by themselves.

We cannot say indeed, that this history is carried on quite to the end of the life of this famous Moll Flanders, for nobody can write their own life to the full end of it, unless they can write it after they are dead:but her husband’s life being written by a third hand, gives a full account of them both, how long they lived together in that country, and how they came both to England again, after about eight years, in which time they were grown very rich, and where she lived, it seems, to be very old; but was not so extraordinary a penitent, as she was at first; it seems only that indeed she always spoke with abhorrence of her former life, and of every part of it.

In her last scene at Maryland and Virginia, many pleasant things happened, which makes that part of her life very agreeable, but they are not told with the same elegancy as those accounted for by herself; so it is still to the more advantage that we break off here.





STRAIGHT MATTER


My true name is so well known in the Records or Registers at Newgate, and in the Old Bailey, and there are some things of such consequence still depending there, relating to my particular conduct, that it is not to be expected I should set my name or the account of my family to this work; perhaps after my death it may be better known, at present it would not be proper, no, not though a general pardon should be issued, even without exceptions of persons or crimes.

It is enough to tell you, that as some of my worst comrades, who are out of the way of doing me harm, having gone out of the world by the steps and the string (as I often expected to go), knew me by the name of Moll Flanders; so you may give me leave to go under that name till I dare own who I have been, as well as who I am.

I have been told, that in one of our neighbour nations, whether it be in France, or where else, I know not, they have an order from the king, that when any criminal is condemned, either to die, or to the galleys, or to be transported, if they leave any children, as such are generally unprovided for, by the forfeiture of their parents, so they are immediately taken into the care of the government, and put into an hospital called the House of Orphans, where they are bred up, clothed, fed, taught, and when fit to go out, are placed to trades, or to services, so as to be well able to provide for themselves by an honest industrious behaviour.

Had this been the custom in our country, I had not been left a poor desolate girl without friends, without clothes, without help or helper, as was my fate; and by which I was not only exposed to very great distresses, even before I was capable either of understanding my case or how to amend it, but brought into a course of life, scandalous in itself, and which in its ordinary course tended to the swift destruction both of soul and body.

But the case was otherwise here, my mother was convicted of felony for a petty theft scarce worth naming, viz., borrowing three pieces of fine Holland of a certain draper in Cheapside: the circumstances are too long to repeat, and I have heard them related so many ways that I can scarce tell which is the right account.

However it was, they all agree in this, that my mother pleaded her belly, and being found quick with child, she was respited for about seven months; after which she was called down, as they term it, to her former judgment, but obtained the favour afterwards of being transported to the plantations, and left me about half a year old; and in bad hands you may be sure.

This is too near the first hours of my life, for me to relate anything of myself but by hearsay; it is enough to mention, that as I was born in such an unhappy place, I had no parish to have recourse to for my nourishment in my infancy, nor can I give the least account how I was kept alive; other than that, as I have been told, some relation of my mother took me away, but at whose expense, or by whose direction, I know nothing at all of it.

The first account that I can recollect, or could ever learn of myself, was that I had wandered among a crew of those people they call gypsies, or Egyptians; but I believe it was but a little while that I had been among them, for I had not had my skin discoloured, as they do to all children they carry about with them, nor can I tell how I came among them, or how I got from them.

It was at Colchester in Essex, that those people left me; and I have a notion in my head, that I left them there (that is, that I hid myself and would not go any farther with them), but I am not able to be particular in that account; only this I remember, that being taken up by some of the parish officers of Colchester, I gave an account that I came into the town with the gipsies, but that I would not go any farther with them, and that so they had left me, but whither they were gone that I knew not, for though they sent round the country to enquire after them, it seems they could not be found.

I was now in a way to be provided for; for though I was not a parish charge upon this or that part of the town by law; yet as my case came to be known, and that I was too young to do any work, being not above three years old, compassion moved the magistrates of the town to take care of me, and I became one of their own as much as if I had been born in the place.

In the provision they made for me, it was my good hap to be put to nurse, as they call it, to a woman who was indeed poor, but had been in better circumstances, and who got a little livelihood by taking such as I was supposed to be, and keeping them with all necessaries, till they were at a certain age, in which it might be supposed they might go to service, or get their own bread.

This woman had also a little school, which she kept to teach children to read and to work; and having, I say, lived before that in good fashion, she bred up the children with a great deal of art, as well as with a great deal of care.

But which was worth all the rest, she bred them up very religiously also, being herself a very sober, pious woman, secondly, very housewifely and clean, and, thirdly, very mannerly, and with good behaviour: so that excepting a plain diet, coarse lodging, and mean clothes, we were brought up as mannerly as if we had been at the dancing school.

I was continued here till I was eight years old, when I was terrified with news that the magistrates (as I think they called them) had ordered that I should go to service; I was able to do but very little wherever I was to go, except it was to run of errands, and be a drudge to some cook-maid, and this they told me of often, which put me into a great fright; for I had a thorough aversion to going to service, as they called it, though I was so young; and I told my nurse, that I believed I could get my living without going to service if she pleased to let me; for she had taught me to work with my needle, and spin worsted, which is the chief trade of that city, and I told her that if she would keep me, I would work for her, and I would work very hard.

I talked to her almost every day of working hard; and, in short, I did nothing but work and cry all day, which grieved the good kind woman so much, that at last she began to be concerned for me, for she loved me very well.

One day after this, as she came into the room, where all the poor children were at work, she sat down just over against me, not in her usual place as mistress, but as if she had set herself on purpose to observe me, and see me work. I was doing something she had set me to, as I remember it was marking some shirts, which she had taken to make, and after a while she began to talk to me: “Thou foolish child,” says she, “thou art always crying,” (for I was crying then). “Prithee, what dost cry for?”

“Because they will take me away,” says I, “and put me to service, and I can’t work housework.”

“Well, child,” says she, “but though you can’t work housework you will learn it in time, and they won’t put you to hard things at first.”

“Yes, they will,” says I, “and if I can’t do it, they will beat me, and the maids will beat me to make me do great work, and I am but a little girl, and I can’t do it.” And then I cried again, till I could not speak any more.

This moved my good motherly nurse, so that she resolved I should not go to service yet, so she bid me not cry, and she would speak to Mr. Mayor, and I should not go to service till I was bigger.

Well, this did not satisfy me, for to think of going to service at all was such a frightful thing to me, that if she had assured me I should not have gone till I was twenty years old, it would have been the same to me, I should have cried all the time, with the very apprehension of its being to be so at last.

When she saw that I was not pacified yet, she began to be angry with me. “And what would you have,” says she. “Don’t I tell you that you shall not go to service till you are bigger?”

“Ay,” says I, “but then I must go at last.”

“Why, what,” said she, “is the girl mad? What would you be, a gentlewoman?”

“Yes,” says I, and cried heartily till I roared out again.

This set the old gentlewoman a-laughing at me, as you may be sure it would.

“Well, madam, forsooth,” says she, gibing at me, “you would be a gentlewoman, and how will you come to be a gentlewoman? What, will you do it by your fingers’ ends?”

“Yes,” says I again, very innocently.

“Why, what can you earn,” says she, “what can you get a day at your work?”

“Threepence,” said I, “when I spin, and fourpence when I work plain work.”

“Alas! poor gentlewoman,” said she again, laughing, “what will that do for thee?”

“It will keep me,” says I, “if you will let me live with you;” and this I said in such a poor petitioning tone, that it made the poor woman’s heart yearn to me, as she told me afterwards.

“But,” says she, “that will not keep you and buy you clothes too; and who must buy the little gentlewoman clothes?” says she, and smiled all the while at me.

“I will work harder then,” says I, “and you shall have it all.”

“Poor child! it won’t keep you,” said she, “it will hardly find you victuals.”

“Then I would have no victuals,” says I again, very innocently, “let me but live with you.”

“Why, can you live without victuals?” says she.

“Yes,” again says I, very much like a child, you may be sure, and still I cried heartily.

I had no policy in all this, you may easily see it was all nature, but it was joined with so much innocence, and so much passion, that in short, it set the good motherly creature a-weeping too, and at last she cried as fast as I did, and then took me, and led me out of the teaching room.

“Come,” says she, “you shan’t go to service, you shall live with me,”and this pacified me for the present.

After this, she going to wait on the Mayor, my story came up, and my good nurse told Mr. Mayor the whole tale: he was so pleased with it, that he would call his lady and his two daughters to hear it, and it made mirth enough among them, you may be sure.

However, not a week had passed over, but on a sudden comes Mrs. Mayoress and her two daughters to the house to see my old nurse, and to see her school and the children: when they had looked about them a little:“Well, Mrs. —,” says the Mayoress to my nurse; “and pray which is the little lass that is to be a gentlewoman?” I heard her, and I was terrible frighted, though I did not know why neither; but Mrs. Mayoress comes up to me, “Well, miss,” says she, “and what are you at work upon?”

The word “Miss” was a language that had hardly been heard of in our school, and I wondered what sad name it was she called me; however, I stood up, made a curtsey, and she took my work out of my hand, looked on it, and said it was very well; then she looked upon one of my hands.“Nay, she may come to be a gentlewoman,” says she, “for ought I know;she has a lady’s hand, I assure you.” This pleased me mightily; but Mrs. Mayoress did not stop there, but put her hand in her pocket, gave me a shilling, and bid me mind my work, and learn to work well, and I might be a gentlewoman for ought she knew.

All this while, my good old nurse, Mrs. Mayoress, and all the rest of them, did not understand me at all, for they meant one sort of thing by the word gentlewoman, and I meant quite another: for alas, all I under-stood by being a gentlewoman, was to be able to work for myself, and get enough to keep me without going to service, whereas they meant to live great and high, and I know not what.

Well, after Mrs. Mayoress was gone, her two daughters came in, and they called for the gentlewoman too, and they talked a long while to me, and I answered them in my innocent way; but always if they asked whether I resolved to be a gentlewoman, I answered, “Yes.” At last they asked me, what a gentlewoman was? That puzzled me much; however, I explained myself negatively, that it was one that did not go to service, to do housework; they were mightily pleased, and liked my little prattle to them, which it seems was agreeable enough to them, and they gave me money too.

As for my money, I gave it all to my Mistress Nurse, as I called her, and told her, she should have all I got when I was a gentlewoman as well as now; By this and some other of my talk, my old tutoress began to understand what I meant by being a gentlewoman; and that it was no more than to be able to get my bread by my own work, and at last, she asked me whether it was not so.

I told her, “Yes,” and insisted on it, that to do so, was to be a gentlewoman; “for,” says I, “there is such a one,” naming a woman that mended lace, and washed the ladies’ laced-heads; “she,” says I, “is a gentlewoman, and they call her madam.”

“Poor child,” says my good old nurse, “you may soon be such a gentlewoman as that, for she is a person of ill fame, and has had two bastards.”

I did not understand anything of that; but I answered, “I am sure they call her madam, and she does not go to service nor do housework,” and therefore I insisted that she was a gentlewoman, and I would be such a gentlewoman as that.

The ladies were told all this again, and they made themselves merry with it, and every now and then Mr. Mayor’s daughters would come and see me, and ask where the little gentlewoman was, which made me not a little proud of myself besides. I was often visited by these young ladies, and sometimes they brought others with them; so that I was known by it almost all over the town.

I was now about ten years old, and began to look a little womanish, for I was mighty grave, very mannerly, and as I had often heard the ladies say I was pretty, and would be very handsome, you may be sure it made me not a little proud: however, that pride had no ill effect upon me yet, only as they often gave me money, and I gave it my old nurse, she, honest woman, was so just as to lay it out again for me, and gave me head-dresses, and linen, and gloves, and I went very neat, for if I had rags on, I would always be clean, or else I would dabble them in water myself;but I say, my good nurse, when I had money given me, very honestly laid it out for me, and would always tell the ladies this, or that, was bought with their money; and this made them give me more, till at last, I was indeed called upon by the magistrates to go out to service; but then I was become so good a workwoman myself, and the ladies were so kind to me, that I was past it; for I could earn as much for my nurse as was enough to keep me; so she told them, that if they would give her leave, she would keep the gentlewoman, as she called me, to be her assistant, and teach the children, which I was very well able to do; for I was very nimble at my work, though I was yet very young.

But the kindness of the ladies did not end here, for when they understood that I was no more maintained by the town as before, they gave me money oftener; and as I grew up, they brought me work to do for them; such as linen to make, laces to mend, and heads to dress up, and not only paid me for doing them, but even taught me how to do them; so that I was a gentlewoman indeed, as I understood that word; for before I was twelve years old, I not only found myself clothes, and paid my nurse for my keeping, but got money in my pocket too.

The ladies also gave me clothes frequently of their own or their children’s; some stockings, some petticoats, some gowns, some one thing, some another, and these my old woman managed for me like a mother, and kept them for me, obliged me to mend them, and turn them to the best advantage, for she was a rare housewife.

At last one of the ladies took such a fancy to me, that she would have me home to her house, for a month, she said, to be among her daughters.

Now though this was exceeding kind in her, yet, as my good woman said to her, unless she resolved to keep me for good and all, she would do the little gentlewoman more harm than good.

“Well,” says the lady, “that’s true, I’ll only take her home for a week then, that I may see how my daughters and she agree, and how I like her temper, and then I’ll tell you more; and in the meantime, if anybody comes to see her as they used to do, you may only tell them, you have sent her out to my house.”

This was prudently managed enough, and I went to the lady’s house, but I was so pleased there with the young ladies, and they so pleased with me, that I had enough to do to come away, and they were so unwilling to part with me.

However, I did come away, and lived almost a year more with my honest old woman, and began now to be very helpful to her; for I was almost fourteen years old, was tall of my age, and looked a little womanish; but I had such a taste of genteel living at the lady’s house, that I was not so easy in my old quarters as I used to be, and I thought it was fine to be a gentlewoman indeed, for I had quite other notions of a gentlewoman now, than I had before; and as I thought that it was fine to be a gentlewoman, so I loved to be among gentlewomen, and therefore I longed to be there again.

When I was about fourteen years and a quarter old, my good old nurse, mother, I ought to call her, fell sick and died; I was then in a sad condition indeed, for as there is no great bustle in putting an end to a poor body’s family, when once they are carried to the grave; so the poor good woman being buried, the parish children were immediately removed by the churchwardens; the school was at an end, and the day children of it had no more to do but just stay at home, till they were sent somewhere else; as for what she left, a daughter, a married woman, came and swept it all away, and removing the goods, they had no more to say to me than to jest with me, and tell me, that the little gentlewoman might set up for herself, if she pleased.

I was frighted out of my wits almost, and knew not what to do; for I was, as it were, turned out of doors to the wide world, and that which was still worse, the old honest woman had two-and-twenty shillings of mine in her hand, which was all the estate the little gentlewoman had in the world;and when I asked the daughter for it, she huffed me and told me she had nothing to do with it.

It was true the good poor woman had told her daughter of it, and that it lay in such a place, that it was the child’s money, and had called once or twice for me to give it me, but I was unhappily out of the way, and when I came back she was past being in a condition to speak of it: however, the daughter was so honest afterwards as to give it me, though at first she used me cruelly about it.

Now was I a poor gentlewoman indeed, and I was just that very night to be turned into the wide world; for the daughter removed all the goods, and I had not so much as a lodging to go to, or a bit of bread to eat: but it seems some of the neighbours took so much compassion of me, as to acquaint the lady in whose family I had been; and immediately she sent her maid to fetch me; and away I went with them bag and baggage, and with a glad heart you may be sure: the fright of my condition had made such an impression upon me, that I did not want now to be a gentlewoman, but was very willing to be a servant, and that any kind of servant they thought fit to have me be.

But my new generous mistress had better thoughts for me. I call her generous, for she exceeded the good woman I was with before in everything, as in estate; I say, in everything except honesty; and for that,though this was a lady most exactly just, yet I must not forget to say on all occasions, that the first, though poor, was as uprightly honest as it was possible.

I was no sooner carried away as I have said by this good gentlewoman, but the first lady, that is to say, the Mayoress that was, sent her daughters to take care of me; and another family which had taken notice of me when I was the little gentlewoman, sent for me after her, so that I was mightily made of; nay, and they were not a little angry, especially the Mayoress, that her friend had taken me away from her; for as she said, I was hers by right, she having been the first that took any notice of me; but they that had me, would not part with me; and as for me I could not be better than where I was.

Here I continued till I was between seventeen and eighteen years old, and here I had all the advantages for my education, that could be imagined; the lady had masters home to teach her daughters to dance, and to speak French, and to write, and others to teach them music; and as I was always with them, I learned as fast as they; and though the masters were not appointed to teach me, yet I learned by imitation and enquiry, all that they learned by instruction and direction. So that in short, I learned to dance and speak French as well as any of them, and to sing much better, for I had a better voice than any of them; I could not so readily come at playing the harpsichord or spinet, because I had no instrument of my own to practise on, and could only come at theirs in the intervals when they left it; but yet I learned tolerably well, and the young ladies at length got two instruments, that is to say, a harpsichord and a spinet too, and then they taught me themselves; but as to dancing, they could hardly help my learning country dances, because they always wanted me to make up even number; and, on the other hand, they were as heartily willing to learn me everything that they had been taught themselves, as I could be to take the learning.

By this means I had, as I have said, all the advantages of education that I could have had, if I had been as much a gentlewoman as they were, with whom I lived; and in some things I had the advantage of my ladies, though they were my superiors, viz., that mine were all the gifts of Nature, and which all their fortunes could not furnish. First, I was apparently handsomer than any of them. Secondly, I was better shaped, and thirdly, I sung better, by which I mean, I had a better voice; in all which you will, I hope, allow me to say, I do not speak my own conceit, but the opinion of all that knew the family.

I had with all these the common vanity of my sex, viz., that being really taken for very handsome, or if you please for a great beauty, I very well knew it, and had as good an opinion of myself, as anybody else could have of me, and particularly I loved to hear anybody speak of it, which happened often, and was a great satisfaction to me.

Thus far I have had a smooth story to tell of myself, and in all this part of my life, I not only had the reputation of living in a very good family, and a family noted and respected everywhere for virtue and sobriety, and for every valuable thing; but I had the character too of a very sober, modest, and virtuous young woman, and such I had always been;neither had I yet any occasion to think of anything else, or to know what a temptation to wickedness meant.

But that which I was too vain of, was my ruin, or rather my vanity was the cause of it. The lady in the house where I was, had two sons, young gentlemen of extraordinary parts and behaviour; and it was my misfortune to be very well with them both, but they managed themselves with me in a quite different manner.

The eldest, a gay gentleman that knew the town as well as the country, and though he had levity enough to do an ill-natured thing, yet had too much judgment of things to pay too dear for his pleasures; he began with that unhappy snare to all women, viz., taking notice upon all occasions how pretty I was, as he called it, how agreeable, how well carriaged, and the like; and this he contrived so subtly, as if he had known as well how to catch a woman in his net, as a partridge when he went a setting; for he would contrive to be talking this to his sisters, when, though I was not by, yet when he knew I was not so far off, but that I should be sure to hear him: his sisters would return softly to him, “Hush, brother, she will hear you, she is but in the next room;” then he would put it off, and talk softlier, as if he had not known it, and begin to acknowledge he was wrong; and then as if he had forgot himself, he would speak aloud again, and I that was so well pleased to hear it, was sure to listen for it upon all occasions.

After he had thus baited his hook, and found easily enough the method how to lay it in my way, he played an open game; and one day going by his sister’s chamber when I was there, he comes in with an air of gaiety, “O! Mrs. Betty,” said he to me, “how do you do, Mrs. Betty? Don’t your cheeks burn, Mrs. Betty?” I made a curtsey, and blushed, but said nothing.

“What makes you talk so, brother?” said the lady.

“Why,” says he, “we have been talking of her below stairs this half hour.”

“Well,” says his sister, “you can say no harm of her, that I am sure, so it is no matter what you have been talking about.”

“Nay,” says he, “it is so far from talking harm of her, that we have been talking a great deal of good, and a great many fine things have been said of Mrs. Betty, I assure you; and particularly, that she is the handsomest young woman in Colchester, and, in short, they begin to toast her health in the town.”

“I wonder at you brother,” says the sister. “Betty wants but one thing, but she had as good want everything, for the market is against our sex just now; and if a young woman has beauty, birth, breeding, wit, sense, manners, modesty, and all to an extreme; yet if she has not money, she’s nobody, she had as good want them all; nothing but money now recommends a woman; the men play the game all into their own hands.”

Her younger brother, who was by, cried, “Hold, sister, you run too fast, I am an exception to your rule: I assure you, if I find a woman so accomplished as you talk of, I won’t trouble myself about the money.”

“O,” says the sister, “but you will take care not to fancy one then without the money.”

“You don’t know that neither,” says the brother.

“But why, sister,” says the elder brother, “why do you exclaim so about the fortune? You are none of them that want a fortune, whatever else you want.”

“I understand you, brother,” replies the lady very smartly; “you suppose I have the money and want the beauty; but as times go now, the first will do, so I have the better of my neighbours.”

“Well,” says the younger brother, “but your neighbours may be even with you; for beauty will steal a husband sometimes in spite of money;and when the maid chances to be handsomer than the mistress, she oftentimes makes as good a market, and rides in a coach before her.”

I thought it was time for me to withdraw, and I did so; but not so far, but that I heard all their discourse, in which I heard abundance of fine things said of myself, which prompted my vanity, but, as I soon found, was not the way to increase my interest in the family, for the sister and the younger brother fell grievously out about it; and as he said some very disobliging things to her, upon my account, so I could easily see that she resented them, by her future conduct to me, which indeed was very unjust; for I had never had the least thought of what she suspected as to her younger brother: indeed the elder brother in his distant remote way had said a great many things as in jest, which I had the folly to believe were in earnest, or to flatter myself with the hopes of what I ought to have supposed he never intended.

It happened one day that he came running upstairs, towards the room where his sister used to sit and work, as he often used to do; and calling to them before he came in, as was his way too, I being there alone, stepped to the door, and said, “Sir, the ladies are not here, they are walked down the garden.”

As I stepped forward to say this, he was just got to the door, and clasping me in his arms, as if it had been by chance, “O! Mrs. Betty,” says he, “are you here? That’s better still, I want to speak with you, more than I do with them.” And then having me in his arms he kissed me three or four times.

I struggled to get away, and yet did it but faintly neither, and he held me fast, and still kissed me, till he was out of breath, and, sitting down, says he, “Dear Betty, I am in love with you.”

His words, I must confess, fired my blood; all my spirits flew about my heart, and put me into disorder enough. He repeated it afterwards several times, that he was in love with me, and my heart spoke as plain as a voice that I liked it; nay, whenever he said, “I am in love with you,”my blushes plainly replied “Would you were, sir.” However, nothing else passed at the time; it was but a surprise, and I soon recovered myself. He had stayed longer with me, but he happened to look out at the window and see his sisters coming up the garden, so he took his leave, kissed me again, told me he was very serious, and I should hear more of him very quickly, and away he went infinitely pleased, and had there not been one misfortune in it, I had been in the right, but the mistake lay here, that Mrs. Betty was in earnest, and the gentleman was not.

From this time my head ran upon strange things, and I may truly say, I was not myself, to have such a gentleman talk to me of being in love with me, and of my being such a charming creature, as he told me I was, these were things I knew not how to bear, my vanity was elevated to the last degree. It is true, I had my head full of pride, but knowing nothing of the wickedness of the times, I had not one thought of my virtue about me;and had my young master offered it at first sight, he might have taken any liberty he thought fit with me; but he did not see his advantage, which was my happiness for that time.

It was not long but he found an opportunity to catch me again, and almost in the same posture, indeed it had more of design in it on his part, though not on my part. It was thus: the young ladies were gone a-visiting with their mother; his brother was out of town, and as for his father he had been at London for a week before; he had so well watched me, that he knew where I was, though I did not so much as know that he was in the house, and he briskly comes up the stairs, and seeing me at work, comes into the room to me directly, and began just as he did before, with taking me in his arms, and kissing me for almost a quarter of an hour together.

It was his younger sister’s chamber that I was in, and, as there was nobody in the house but the maid below stairs, he was it may be the ruder:in short, he began to be in earnest with me indeed; perhaps he found me a little too easy, for I made no resistance to him while he only held me in his arms and kissed me; indeed I was too well pleased with it, to resist him much.

Well, tired with that kind of work, we sat down, and there he talked with me a great while; he said, he was charmed with me, and that he could not rest till he had told me how he was in love with me, and if I could love him again, and would make him happy, I should be the saving of his life;and many such fine things. I said little to him again, but easily discovered that I was a fool, and that I did not in the least perceive what he meant.

Then he walked about the room, and, taking me by the hand, I walked with him; and by and by taking his advantage, he threw me down upon the bed, and kissed me there most violently; but to give him his due, offered no manner of rudeness to me, only kissed me a great while; after this he thought he had heard somebody come upstairs, so he got off from the bed, lifted me up, professing a great deal of love for me, but told me it was all an honest affection, and that he meant no ill to me, and with that put five guineas into my hand, and went downstairs.

I was more confounded with the money than I was before with the love; and began to be so elevated, that I scarce knew the ground I stood on: I am the more particular in this, that if it comes to be read by any innocent young body, they may learn from it to guard themselves against the mischiefs which attend an early knowledge of their own beauty; if a young woman once thinks herself handsome, she never doubts the truth of any man that tells her he is in love with her; for if she believes herself charming enough to captivate him, it is natural to expect the effects of it.

This gentleman had now fired his inclination, as much as he had my vanity, and, as if he had found that he had an opportunity, and was sorry he did not take hold of it, he comes up again in about half an hour, and falls to work with me again just as he did before, only with a little less introduction.

And first, when he entered the room, he turned about, and shut the door. “Mrs. Betty,” said he, “I fancied before somebody was coming upstairs, but it was not so. However,” adds he, “if they find me in the room with you, they shan’t catch me a-kissing you.”

I told him I did not know who should be coming upstairs, for I believed there was nobody in the house, but the cook, and the other maid, and they never came up those stairs.

“Well, my dear,” says he, “it is good to be sure however,” and so he sits down and we began to talk; and now, though I was still on fire with his first visit, and said little, he did as it were put words in my mouth, telling me how passionately he loved me, and that though he could not till he came to his estate, yet he was resolved to make me happy then, and himself too; that is to say, to marry me, and abundance of such things,which I, poor fool, did not understand the drift of, but acted as if there was no kind of love but that which tended to matrimony; and if he had spoken of that, I had no room, as well as no power, to have said no; but we were not come to that length yet.

We had not sat long, but he got up, and, stopping my very breath with kisses, threw me upon the bed again; but then he went further with me than decency permits me to mention, nor had it been in my power to have denied him at that moment, had he offered much more than he did.

However, though he took these freedoms with me, it did not go to that which they call the last favour, which, to do him justice, he did not attempt; and he made that self-denial of his a plea for all his freedoms with me upon other occasions after this: when this was over, he stayed but a little while, but he put almost a handful of gold in my hand, and left me a thousand protestations of his passion for me, and of his loving me above all the women in the world.

It will not be strange, if I now began to think; but alas! it was but with very little solid reflection: I had a most unbounded stock of vanity and pride, and but a very little stock of virtue: I did indeed cast some-times with myself what my young master aimed at, but thought of nothing but the fine words and the gold; whether he intended to marry me or not seemed a matter of no great consequence to me; nor did I so much as think of making any capitulation for myself, until he made a kind of formal proposal to me, as you shall hear presently.

Thus I gave up myself to ruin without the least concern, and am a fair memento to all young women, whose vanity prevails over their virtue: nothing was ever so stupid on both sides, had I acted as became me, and resisted as virtue and honour required, he had either desisted his attacks, finding no room to expect the end of his design, or had made fair and honourable proposals of marriage; in which case, whoever blamed him, nobody could have blamed me. In short, if he had known me, and how easy the trifle he aimed at was to be had, he would have troubled his head no farther, but have given me four or five guineas, and have lain with me the next time he had come at me: on the other hand, if I had known his thoughts, and how hard he supposed I would be to be gained, I might have made my own terms, and if I had not capitulated for an immediate marriage, I might for a maintenance till marriage, and might have had what I would; for he was rich to excess, besides what he had in expectation; but I had wholly abandoned all such thoughts, and was taken up only with the pride of my beauty, and of being beloved by such a gentleman: as for the gold, I spent whole hours in looking upon it; I told the guineas over a thousand times a day: never poor vain creature was so wrapt up with every part of the story as I was, not considering what was before me, and how near my ruin was at the door; and indeed I think, I rather wished for that ruin, than studied to avoid it.

In the meantime, however, I was cunning enough, not to give the least room to any in the family to imagine that I had the least correspondence with him; I scarce ever looked towards him in public, or answered if he spoke to me; when, but for all that, we had every now and then a little encounter, where we had room for a word or two, and now and then a kiss, but no fair opportunity for the mischief intended;and especially considering that he made more circumlocution than he had occasion for, and the work appearing difficult to him, he really made it so.

But as the Devil is an unwearied tempter, so he never fails to find an opportunity for the wickedness he invites to: it was one evening that I was in the garden, with his two younger sisters and himself, when he found means to convey a note into my hand, by which he told me that he would tomorrow desire me publicly to go of an errand for him, and that I should see him somewhere by the way.

Accordingly after dinner, he very gravely says to me, his sisters being all by, “Mrs. Betty, I must ask a favour of you.”

“What’s that?” says the second sister.

“Nay, sister,” says he, very gravely, “if you can’t spare Mrs. Betty today, any other time will do.”

Yes, they said, they could spare her well enough, and the sister begged pardon for asking.

“Well, but,” says the eldest sister, “you must tell Mrs. Betty what it is; if it be any private business that we must not hear, you may call her out, there she is.”

“Why, sister,” says the gentleman very gravely, “what do you mean? I only desire her to go into the High Street” (and then he pulls out a turnover), “to such a shop.” And then he tells them a long story of two fine neckcloths he had bid money for, and he wanted to have me go and make an errand to buy a neck to that turnover that he showed, and if they would not take my money for the neckcloths to bid a shilling more, and haggle with them; and then he made more errands, and so continued to have such petty business to do, that I should be sure to stay a good while.

When he had given me my errands, he told them a long story of a visit he was going to make to a family they all knew, and where was to be such and such gentlemen, and very formally asked his sisters to go with him, and they as formally excused themselves, because of company that they had notice was to come and visit them that afternoon, all which by the way he had contrived on purpose.

He had scarce done speaking, but his man came up to tell him that Sir W— H—’s coach stopped at the door; so he runs down, and comes up again immediately. “Alas!” says he aloud, “there’s all my mirth spoiled at once; Sir W— has sent his coach for me, and desires to speak with me.”It seems this Sir W— was a gentleman who lived about three miles off, to whom he had spoke on purpose to lend him his chariot for a particular occasion, and had appointed it to call for him, as it did, about three o’clock.

Immediately he calls for his best wig, hat, and sword, and ordering his man to go to the other place to make his excuse, that was to say, he made an excuse to send his man away, he prepares to go into the coach. As he was going, he stopped awhile, and speaks mighty earnestly to me about his business, and finds an opportunity to say very softly, “Come away, my dear, as soon as ever you can.” I said nothing, but made a curtsey, as if I had done so to what he said in public; in about a quarter of an hour I went out too; I had no dress, other than before, except that I had a hood, a mask, a fan, and a pair of gloves in my pocket: so that there was not the least suspicion in the house. He waited for me in a back lane, which he knew I must pass by, and the coachman knew whither to go, which was to a certain place called Mile End, where lived a confidant of his, where we went in, and where was all the convenience in the world to be as wicked as we pleased.

When we were together, he began to talk very gravely to me, and to tell me, he did not bring me there to betray me; that his passion for me would not suffer him to abuse me: that he resolved to marry me as soon as he came to his estate; that in the meantime, if I would grant his request, he would maintain me very honourably, and made me a thousand protestations of his sincerity, and of his affection to me; and that he would never abandon me, and, as I may say, made a thousand more preambles than he need to have done.

However, as he pressed me to speak, I told him I had no reason to question the sincerity of his love to me, after so many protestations, but—and there I stopped, as if I left him to guess the rest.

“But what, my dear,” says he, “I guess what you mean, what if you should be with child, is not that it? Why, then,” says he, “I’ll take care of you, and provide for you, and the child, too; and that you may see I am not in jest,” says he, “here’s an earnest for you”—and with that he pulls out a silk purse with a hundred guineas in it, and gave it me—“and I’ll give you such another,” says he, “every year till I marry you.”

My colour came and went at the sight of the purse, and with the fire of his proposal together, so that I could not say a word, and he easily perceived it; so putting the purse into my bosom, I made no more resistance to him, but let him do just what he pleased, and as often as he pleased; and thus I finished my own destruction at once, for from this day, being forsaken of my virtue, and my modesty, I had nothing of value left to recommend me, either to God’s blessing, or man’s assistance.

But things did not end here, I went back to the town, did the business he directed me to, and was at home before anybody thought me long; as for my gentleman, he stayed out till late at night, and there was not the least suspicion in the family, either on his account or on mine.

We had after this, frequent opportunities to repeat our crime, and especially at home, when his mother and the young ladies went abroad a-visiting, which he watched so narrowly, as never to miss; knowing always beforehand when they went out, and then failed not to catch me all alone, and securely enough; so that we took our fill of our wicked pleasures for near half a year; and yet, which was the most to my satisfaction, I was not with child.

But before this half year was expired, his younger brother, of whom I have made some mention in the beginning of the story, falls to work with me; and he finding me alone in the garden one evening, begins a story of the same kind to me, made good honest professions of being in love with me; and, in short, proposes fairly and honourably to marry me.

I was now confounded, and driven to such an extremity, as the like was never known to me; I resisted the proposal with obstinacy, and began to arm myself with arguments: I laid before him the inequality of the match, the treatment I should meet with in the family, the ingratitude it would be to his good father and mother, who had taken me into their house upon such generous principles, and when I was in such a low condition; and, in short, I said everything to dissuade him that I could imagine except telling him the truth, which would indeed have put an end to it all, but that I durst not think of mentioning.

But here happened a circumstance that I did not expect indeed, which put me to my shifts; for this young gentleman, as he was plain and honest, so he pretended to nothing but what was so too; and knowing his own innocence, he was not so careful to make his having a kindness for Mrs. Betty a secret in the house, as his brother was; and though he did not let them know that he had talked to me about it, yet he said enough to let his sisters perceive he loved me, and his mother saw it too, which though they took no notice of to me, yet they did to him, and immediately I found their carriage to me altered more than ever before.

I saw the cloud, though I did not foresee the storm. It was easy, I say, to see their carriage was altered, and that it grew worse and worse every day, until at last I got information that I should in a very little while be desired to remove.

I was not alarmed at the news, having a full satisfaction that I should be provided for; and especially considering that I had reason every day to expect I should be with child, and that then I should be obliged to remove without any pretences for it.

After some time, the younger gentleman took an opportunity to tell me, that the kindness he had for me had got vent in the family. He did not charge me with it, he said, for he knew well enough which way it came out; he told me his way of talking had been the occasion of it, for that he did not make his respect for me so much a secret as he might have done, and the reason was, that he was at a point that if I would consent to have him, he would tell them all openly that he loved me, and that he intended to marry me: that it was true, his father and mother might resent it, and be unkind, but he was now in a way to live, being bred to the law, and he did not fear maintaining me, and that in short, as he believed I would not be ashamed of him, so he was resolved not to be ashamed of me, and that he scorned to be afraid to own me now, who he resolved to own after I was his wife, and therefore I had nothing to do but to give him my hand, and he would answer for all the rest.

I was now in a dreadful condition indeed, and now I repented heartily my easiness with the eldest brother, not from any reflection of conscience, for I was a stranger to those things, but I could not think of being a whore to one brother, and a wife to the other; it came also into my thoughts, that the first brother had promised to make me his wife when he came to his estate; but I presently remembered, what I had often thought of, that he had never spoken a word of having me for a wife, after he had conquered me for a mistress; and indeed till now, though I said I thought of it often, yet it gave no disturbance at all, for as he did not seem in the least to lessen his affection to me, so neither did he lessen his bounty, though he had the discretion himself to desire me not to lay out a penny in clothes, or to make the least show extraordinary, because it would necessarily give jealousy in the family, since everybody knew I could come at such things no manner of ordinary way, but by some private friendship, which they would presently have suspected.

I was now in a great strait, and knew not what to do; the main difficulty was this, the younger brother not only laid close siege to me, but suffered it to be seen; he would come into his sister’s room, and his mother’s room, and sit down, and talk a thousand kind things to me, even before their faces; so that the whole house talked of it, and his mother reproved him for it, and their carriage to me appeared quite altered; in short, his mother had let fall some speeches, as if she intended to put me out of the family, that is in English, to turn me out of doors. Now I was sure this could not be a secret to his brother, only that he might think, as indeed nobody else yet did, that the youngest brother had made any proposal to me about it; but as I easily could see that it would go farther, so I saw likewise there was an absolute necessity to speak of it to him, or that he would speak of it to me, but knew not whether I should break it to him or let it alone till he should break it to me.

Upon serious consideration, for indeed now I began to consider things very seriously, and never till now, I resolved to tell him of it first, and it was not long before I had an opportunity, for the very next day his brother went to London upon some business, and the family being out a-visiting, just as it happened before, and as indeed was often the case, he came according to his custom to spend an hour or two with Mrs. Betty.

When he had sat down a while, he easily perceived there was an alteration in my countenance, that I was not so free and pleasant with him as I used to be, and particularly, that I had been a crying; he was not long before he took notice of it, and asked me in very kind terms what was the matter, and if anything troubled me: I would have put it off if I could, but it was not to be concealed; so after suffering many importunities to draw that out of me which I longed as much as possible to disclose, I told him that it was true, something did trouble me, and something of such a nature that I could hardly conceal from him, and yet that I could not tell how to tell him of it neither; that it was a thing that not only surprised me, but greatly perplexed me, and that I knew not what course to take, unless he would direct me. He told me with great tenderness, that let it be what it would, I should not let it trouble me, for he would protect me from all the world.

I then began at a distance, and told him I was afraid the ladies had got some secret information of our correspondence; for that it was easy to see that their conduct was very much changed towards me, and that now it was come to pass, that they frequently found fault with me, and sometimes fell quite out with me, though I never gave them the least occasion: that whereas I used always to lie with the elder sister, I was lately put to lie by myself, or with one of the maids; and that I had overheard them several times talking very unkindly about me; but that which confirmed it all was, that one of the servants had told me that she had heard I was to be turned out, and that it was not safe for the family that I should be any longer in the house.

He smiled when he heard of this, and I asked him how he could make so light of it, when he must needs know that if there was any discovery, I was undone, and that it would hurt him, though not ruin him, as it would me: I upbraided him, that he was like the rest of his sex, that when they had the character of a woman at their mercy, oftentimes made it their jest, and at least looked upon it as a trifle, and counted the ruin of those they had had their will of, as a thing of no value.

He saw me warm and serious, and he changed his style immediately;he told me, he was sorry I should have such a thought of him: that he had never given me the least occasion for it, but had been as tender of my reputation, as he could be of his own; that he was sure our correspondence had been managed with so much address, that not one creature in the family had so much as a suspicion of it; that if he smiled when I told him my thoughts, it was at the assurance he lately received, that out understanding one another was not so much as guessed at, and that when he had told me how much reason he had to be easy, I should smile as he did, for he was very certain it would give me a full satisfaction.

“This is a mystery I cannot understand,” says I, “or how it should be to my satisfaction, that I am to be turned out of doors; for if our correspondence is not discovered, I know not what else I have done to change the faces of the whole family to me, who formerly used me with so much tenderness, as if I had been one of their own children.”

“Why, look you, child,” says he; “that they are uneasy about you, that is true, but that they have the least suspicion of the case as it is, and as it respects you and I, is so far from being true, that they suspect my brother Robin, and, in short, they are fully persuaded he makes love to you:nay, the fool has put it into their heads too himself, for he is continually bantering them about it, and making a jest of himself; I confess I think he is wrong to do so, because he cannot but see it vexes them, and makes them unkind to you; but it is a satisfaction to me, because of the assurance it gives me, that they do not suspect me in the least, and I hope this will be to your satisfaction too.”

“So it is,” says I, “one way, but this does not reach my case at all, nor is this the chief thing that troubles me, though I have been concerned about that too.”

“What is it then?” says he. With which, I fell into tears, and could say nothing to him at all. He strove to pacify me all he could, but began at last to be very pressing upon me, to tell what it was. At last I answered, that I thought I ought to tell him too, and that he had some right to know it, besides, that I wanted his direction in the case, for I was in such perplexity that I knew not what course to take, and then I related the whole affair to him; I told him, how imprudently his brother had managed himself, in making himself so public; for that if he had kept it a secret, I could but have denied him positively, without giving any reason for it, and he would in time have ceased his solicitations; but that he had the vanity; first, to depend upon it that I would not deny him, and then had taken the freedom to tell his design to the whole house.

I told him how far I had resisted him, and how sincere and honourable his offers were. “But,” says I, “my case will be doubly hard;for as they carry it ill to me now, because he desires to have me, they’ll carry it worse when they shall find I have denied him: and they will presently say, there’s something else in it, and that I am married already to some body else, or that I would never refuse a match so much above me as this was.”

This discourse surprised him indeed very much. He told me that it was a critical point indeed for me to manage, and he did not see which way I should get out of it; but he would consider of it, and let me know next time we met, what resolution he was come to about it; and in the mean time, desired I would not give my consent to his brother, nor yet give him a flat denial, but that I would hold him in suspense awhile.

I seemed to start at his saying, I should not give him my consent; I told him he knew very well, I had no consent to give; that he had engaged himself to marry me, and that I was thereby engaged to him; that he had all along told me, I was his wife, and I looked upon myself as effectually so, as if the ceremony had passed; and that it was from his own mouth that I did so, he having all along persuaded me to call myself his wife.

“Well, my dear,” says he, “don’t be concerned at that now; if I am not your husband, I’ll be as good as a husband to you, and do not let those things trouble you now, but let me look a little farther into this affair, and I shall be able to say more next time we meet.”

He pacified me as well as he could with this, but I found he was very thoughtful, and that though he was very kind to me, and kissed me a thousand times, and more I believe, and gave me money too, yet he offered no more all the while we were together, which was above two hours, and which I much wondered at, considering how it used to be, and what opportunity we had.

His brother did not come from London for five or six days, and it was two days before he got an opportunity to talk with him; but then getting him by himself, he talked very close to him about it, and the same evening found means (for we had a long conference together) to repeat all their discourse to me, which as near as I can remember, was to the purpose following.

He told him he heard strange news of him since he went, viz., that he had made love to Mrs. Betty.

“Well,” says his brother, a little angrily, “and what then? What has anybody to do with that?”

“Nay,” says his brother, “don’t be angry, Robin, I don’t pretend to have anything to do with it, but I find they do concern themselves about it, and that they have used the poor girl ill about it, which I should take as done to myself.”

“Who do you mean by they?”says Robin.

“I mean my mother and the girls,” says the elder brother.

“But hark ye,” says his brother, “are you in earnest, do you really love the girl?”

“Why then,” says Robin, “I will be free with you; I do love her above all the women in the world, and I will have her, let them say and do what they will, I believe the girl will not deny me.”

It stuck me to the heart when he told me this, for though it was most rational to think I would not deny him, yet I knew in my own conscience, I must, and I saw my ruin in my being obliged to do so; but I knew it was my business to talk otherwise then, so I interrupted him in his story thus:

“Ay!” said I, “does he think I cannot deny him? But he shall find I can deny him for all that.”

“Well, my dear,” says he, “but let me give you the whole story as it went on between us, and then say what you will.”

Then he went on and told me, that he replied thus:

“But, brother, you know she has nothing, and you may have several ladies with good fortunes.”

“’Tis no matter for that,” said Robin, “I love the girl; and I will never please my pocket in marrying, and not please my fancy.”

“And so, my dear,” adds he, “there is no opposing him.”

“Yes, yes,” says I, “I can oppose him, I have learnt to say ‘No’, now, though I had not learnt it before; if the best lord in the land offered me marriage now, I could very cheerfully say ‘No’ to him.”

“Well, but, my dear,” says he, “what can you say to him? You know, as you said before, he will ask you many questions about it, and all the house will wonder what the meaning of it should be.”

“Why,” says I, smiling, “I can stop all their mouths at one clap, by telling him and them too, that I am married already to his elder brother.”

He smiled a little too at the word, but I could see it startled him, and he could not hide the disorder it put him into: however, he returned, “Why, though that may be true, in some sense, yet I suppose you are but in jest, when you talk of giving such an answer as that, it may not be convenient on many accounts.”

“No, no,” says I pleasantly, “I am not so fond of letting that secret come out, without your consent.”

“But what then can you say to them,” says he, “when they find you positive against a match which would be apparently so much to your advantage?”

“Why,” says I, “should I be at a loss? First, I am not obliged to give them any reason: on the other hand, I may tell them I am married already, and stop there, and that will be a full stop too to him, for he can have no reason to ask one question after it.”

“Ay,” says he, “but the whole house will tease you about that, and if you deny them positively, they will be disobliged at you, and suspicious besides.”

“Why,” says I, “what can I do? What would you have me do? I was in strait enough before, as I told you, and acquainted you with the circumstances, that I might have your advice.”

“My dear,” says he, “I have been considering very much upon it, you may be sure, and though the advice has many mortifications in it to me, and may at first seem strange to you, yet, all things considered, I see no better way for you, than to let him go on; and if you find him hearty and in earnest, marry him.”

I gave him a look full of horror at those words, and turning pale as death, was at the very point of sinking down out of the chair I sat in;when giving a start, “My dear,” says he aloud, “what’s the matter with you? Where are you a going?”—and a great many such things; and with jogging and calling to me, fetched me a little to myself, though it was a good while before I fully recovered my senses, and was not able to speak for several minutes.

When I was fully recovered, he began again: “My dear,” says he,“I would have you consider seriously of it: you may see plainly how the family stand in this case, and they would be stark mad if it was my case, as it is my brother’s, and for ought I see, it would be my ruin and yours too.”

“Ay!” says I, still speaking angrily; “are all your protestations and vows to be shaken by the dislike of the family? Did I not always object that to you, and you made a light thing of it, as what you were above, and would not value; and is it come to this now? Is this your faith and honour, your love, and the solidity of your promises?”

He continued perfectly calm, notwithstanding all my reproaches, and I was not sparing of them at all; but he replied at last, “My dear, I have not broken one promise with you yet; I did tell you I would marry you when I was come to my estate; but you see my father is a hail, healthy man, and may live these thirty years still, and not be older than several are round us in the town; and you never proposed my marrying you sooner, because you know it might be my ruin; and as to the rest, I have not failed you in anything.”

I could not deny a word of this. “But why then,” says I, “can you persuade me to such a horrid step, as leaving you, since you have not left me? Will you allow no affection, no love on my side, where there has been so much on your side? Have I made you no returns? Have I given no testimony of my sincerity, and of my passion? Are the sacrifices I have made of honour and modesty to you, no proof of my being tied to you in bonds too strong to be broken?”

“But here, my dear,” says he, “you may come into a safe station,and appear with honour, and the remembrance of what we have done may be wrapped up in an eternal silence, as if it had never happened; you shall always have my sincere affection, only then it shall be honest, and perfectly just to my brother; you shall be my dear sister, as now you are my dear—” and there he stopped.

“Your dear whore,” says I, “you would have said, and you might as well have said it; but I understand you: however, I desire you to remember the long discourses you have had with me, and the many hours’ pains you have taken to persuade me to believe myself an honest woman; that I was your wife intentionally, and that it was as effectual a marriage that had passed between us, as if we had been publicly wedded by the parson of the parish; you know these have been your own words to me.”

I found this was a little too close upon him, but I made it up in what follows; he stood stock still for a while, and said nothing, and I went on thus:

“You cannot,” says I, “without the highest injustice believe that I yielded upon all these persuasions without a love not to be questioned, not to be shaken again by anything that could happen afterward. If you have such dishonourable thoughts of me, I must ask you what foundation have I given for such a suggestion. If then I have yielded to the importunities of my affection, and if I have been persuaded to believe that I am really your wife, shall I now give the lie to all those arguments, and call myself your whore, or mistress, which is the same thing? And will you transfer me to your brother? Can you transfer my affection? Can you bid me cease loving you, and bid me love him? Is it in my power, think you, to make such a change at demand? No, sir,” said I, “depend upon it, it is impossible, and whatever the change on your side may be, I will ever be true; and I had much rather, since it is come that unhappy length, be your whore than your brother’s wife.”

He appeared pleased and touched with the impression of this last discourse, and told me that he stood where he did before; that he had not been unfaithful to me in any one promise he had ever made yet, but that there were so many terrible things presented themselves to his view in the affair before me, that he had thought of the other as a remedy, only that he thought this would not be an entire parting us, but we might love as friends all our days, and perhaps with more satisfaction than we should in the station we were now in. That he durst say, I could not apprehend anything from him, as to betraying a secret, which could not but be the destruction of us both if it came out: that he had but one question to ask of me, that could lie in the way of it, and if that question was answered, he could not but think still it was the only step I could take.

I guessed at his question presently, viz., whether I was not with child? As to that, I told him, he need not be concerned about it, for I was not with child.

“Why, then, my dear,” says he, “we have no time to talk further now; consider of it; I cannot but be of the opinion still, that it will be the best course you can take.” And with this, he took his leave, and the more hastily too, his mother and sisters ringing at the gate just at the moment he had risen up to go.

He left me in the utmost confusion of thought; and he easily perceived it the next day, and all the rest of the week, but he had no opportunity to come at me all that week, till the Sunday after, when I being indisposed did not go to church, and he making some excuse stayed at home.

And now he had me an hour and half again by myself, and we fell into the same arguments all over again; at last I asked him warmly, “What opinion he must have of my modesty, that he could suppose, I should so much as entertain a thought of lying with two brothers?” And assured him it could never be. I added, “If he was to tell me that he would never see me more, than which nothing but death could be more terrible, yet I could never entertain a thought so dishonourable to myself, and so base to him;and therefore, I entreated him, if he had one grain of respect or affection left for me, that he would speak no more of it to me, or that he would pull his sword out and kill me.”

He appeared surprised at my obstinacy, as he called it, told me I was unkind to myself, and unkind to him in it; that it was a crisis unlooked for upon us both, but that he did not see any other way to save us both from ruin, and therefore he thought it the more unkind; but that if he must say no more of it to me, he added with an unusual coldness, that he did not know anything else we had to talk of; and so he rose up to take his leave;I rose up too, as if with the same indifference, but when he came to give me, as it were, a parting kiss, I burst out into such a passion of crying that though I would have spoke, I could not, and, only pressing his hand, seemed to give him the adieu, but cried vehemently.

He was sensibly moved with this; so he sat down again, and said a great many kind things to me, but still urged the necessity of what he had proposed; all the while insisting, that if I did refuse, he would notwithstanding provide for me; but letting me plainly see that he would decline me in the main point; nay, even as a mistress; making it a point of honour not to lie with the woman, that for ought he knew, might one time or other come to be his brother’s wife.

The bare loss of him as a gallant was not so much my affliction, as the loss of his person, whom indeed I loved to distraction; and the loss of all the expectations I had, and which I always built my hopes upon, of having him one day for my husband: these things oppressed my mind so much, that, in short, the agonies of my mind threw me into a high fever, and long it was, that none in the family expected my life.

I was reduced very low indeed, and was often delirious; but nothing lay so near me, as the fear that when I was light-headed, I should say something or other to his prejudice. I was distressed in my mind also to see him, and so he was to see me, for he really loved me most passionately; but it could not be; there was not the least room to desire it on one side, or other.

It was near five weeks that I kept my bed, and though the violence of my fever abated in three weeks, yet it several times returned; and the physicians said two or three times they could do no more for me, but that they must leave nature and the distemper to fight it out. After the end of five weeks I grew better, but was so weak, so altered, and recovered so slowly, that the physicians apprehended I should go into a consumption;and which vexed me most, they gave their opinion, that my mind was oppressed,that something troubled me,and,in short,that I was in love:upon this, the whole house set upon me to press me to tell, whether I was in love or not, and with whom? But as I well might, I denied my being in love at all.

They had on this occasion a squabble one day about me at table, that had like to put the whole family in an uproar, they happened to be all at table, but the father; as for me I was ill, and in my chamber. At the beginning of the talk, the old gentlewoman, who had sent me somewhat to eat, bid her maid go up, and ask me if I would have any more; but the maid brought down word, I had not eaten half what she had sent me already.

“Alas,” says the old lady, “that poor girl; I am afraid she will never be well.”

“Well!” says the elder brother, “how should Mrs. Betty be well, they say she is in love?”

“I believe nothing of it,” says the old gentlewoman,

“I don’t know,” says the eldest sister, “what to say to it; they have made such a rout about her being so handsome, and so charming, and I know not what, and that in her hearing, too, that has turned the creature’s head, I believe, and who knows what possessions may follow such doings? For my part I don’t know what to make of it.”

“Why, sister, you must acknowledge she is very handsome,” says the elder brother.

“Aye, and a great deal handsomer than you, sister,” says Robin, “and that’s your mortification.”

“Well, well, that is not the question,” says his sister. “The girl is well enough, and she knows it, she need not be told of it to make her vain.”

“We don’t talk of her being vain,” says the elder brother, “but of her being in love; maybe she is in love with herself, it seems my sisters think so.”

“I would she was in love with me,” says Robin. “I’d quickly put her out of her pain.”

“What do you mean by that, son?” says the old lady, “how can you talk so?”

“Why, madam,” says Robin again, very honestly, “do you think I’d let the poor girl die for love, and of me too, that is so near at hand to be had.”

“Fie, brother,” says the second sister, “how can you talk so? Would you take a creature that has not a groat in the world?”

“Prithee, child,” says Robin. “Beauty’s a portion, and good humour with it is a double portion; I wish thou hadst half her stock of both for thy portion.”

So there was her mouth stopped.

“I find,” says the eldest sister, “if Betty is not in love, my brother is. I wonder he had not broke his mind to Betty. I warrant she won’t say ‘No’.”

“They that yield when they are asked,” said Robin, “are one step before them that were never asked to yield, and two steps before them that yield before they are asked; and that’s an answer to you, sister.”

This fired the sister, and she flew into a passion, and said, things were come to that pass, that it was time the wench—meaning me—was out of the family; and but that she was not fit to be turned out, she hoped her father and mother would consider of it, as soon as she could be removed.

Robin replied, that was for the master and mistress of the family, who were not to be taught by one that had so little judgement as his eldest sister.

It run up a great deal farther; the sister scolded, Robin rallied and bantered, but poor Betty lost ground by it extremely in the family: I heard of it, and cried heartily, and the old lady came up to me, somebody having told her that I was so much concerned about it. I complained to her, that it was very hard the doctors should pass such a censure upon me, for which they had no ground; and that it was still harder, considering the circumstances I was under in the family; that I hoped I had done nothing to lessen her esteem for me, or given any occasion for the bickering between her sons and daughters; and had more need to think of a coffin, than of being in love, and begged she would not let me suffer in her opinion for anybody’s mistakes but my own.

She was sensible of the justice of what I said, but told me, since there had been such a clamour among them, and that her younger son talked after such a rattling way as he did, she desired I would be so faithful to her, as to answer her but one question sincerely. I told her I would, and with the utmost plainness and sincerity. Why, then, the question was,“whether there was anything between her son Robert and me?”

I told her with all the protestations of sincerity that I was able to make, and as I might well do, that there was not, nor ever had been; I told her, that Mr. Robert had rattled and jested, as she knew it was his way,and that I took it always as I supposed he meant it, to be a wild airy way of discourse that had no signification in it; and assured her, that there was not the least tittle of what she understood by it between us; and that those who had suggested it had done me a great deal of wrong, and Mr. Robert no service at all.

The old lady was fully satisfied, and kissed me, spoke cheerfully to me, and bid me take care of my health, and want for nothing, and so took her leave. But when she came down, she found the brother and all his sisters together by the ears; they were angry even to passion, at his upbraiding them with their being homely, and having never had any sweethearts, never having been asked the question, their being so forward as almost to ask first, and the like. He rallied them with Mrs. Betty; how pretty, how good humoured, how she sung better than they did, and danced better, and how much handsomer she was; and in doing this, he omitted no ill-natured thing that could vex them. The old lady came down in the height of it, and to stop it, told them the discourse she had had with me, and how I answered, that there was nothing between Mr. Robert and I.

“She’s wrong there,” says Robin, “for if there was not a great deal between us, we should be closer together than we are. I told her I loved her hugely,” says he, “but I could never make the jade believe I was in earnest.”

“I do not know how you should,” says his mother, “nobody in their senses could believe you were in earnest, to talk so to a poor girl, whose circumstances you know so well.”

“But prithee, son,” adds she, “since you tell us you could not make her believe you were in earnest, what must we believe about it? For you ramble so in your discourse, that nobody knows whether you are in earnest or in jest. But as I find the gir, by her own confession has answered truly, I wish you would do so too, and tell me seriously, so that I may depend upon it. is there anything in it or no? Are you in earnest or no? Are you distracted indeed, or are you not? ’Tis a weighty question, I wish you would make us easy about it.”

“By my faith, madam,” says Robin, “’tis in vain to mince the matter, or tell any more lies about it, I am in earnest, as much as a man is that’s going to be hanged. If Mrs. Betty would say she loved me, and that she would marry me, I’d have her tomorrow morning fasting; and say ‘To have and to hold’, instead of eating my breakfast.”

“Well,” says the mother, “then there’s one son lost.” And she said it in a very mournful tone, as one greatly concerned at it.

“I hope not, madam,” says Robin, “no man is lost when a good wife has found him.”

“Why, but child,” says the old lady, “she is a beggar.”

“Why, then, madam, she has the more need of charity,” says Robin.“I’ll take her off the hands of the parish, and she and I’ll beg together.”

“It’s bad jesting with such things,” says the mother.

“I don’t jest, madam,” says Robin: “we’ll come and beg your pardon, madam; and your blessing, madam, and my father’s.”

“This is all out of the way, son,” says the mother, “if you are in earnest, you are undone.”

“I am afraid not,” says he, “for I am really afraid she won’t have me. After all my sister’s huffing, I believe I shall never be able to persuade her to it.”

“That’s a fine tale indeed, she is not so far gone neither. Mrs. Betty is no fool,” says the youngest sister, “do you think she has learned to say ‘no’, any more than other people?”

“No, Mrs. Mirth-Wit,” says Robin, “Mrs. Betty’s no fool, but Mrs. Betty may be engaged some other way, and what then?”

“Nay,” says the eldest sister, “we can say nothing to that. Who must it be to then? She is never out of the doors, it must be between you.”

“I have nothing to say to that,” says Robin. “I have been examined enough; there’s my brother, if it must be between us, go to work with him.”

This stung the elder brother to the quick, and he concluded that Robin had discovered something. However, he kept himself from appearing disturbed. “Prithee,” says he, “don’t go to sham your stories off upon me, I tell you. I deal in no such ware. I have nothing to say to no Mrs. Bettys in the parish.” And with that he rose up, and brushed off.

“No,” says the eldest sister, “I dare answer for my brother; he knows the world better.”

Thus the discourse ended; but it left the eldest brother quite confounded: he concluded his brother had made a full discovery, and he began to doubt whether I had been concerned in it, or not; but with all his management, he could not bring it about to get at me; at last he was so perplexed, that he was quite desperate, and resolved he would see me whatever came of it. In order to do this, he contrived it so, that one day after dinner, watching his eldest sister, till he could see her go upstairs, he runs after her, “Hark ye, sister,” says he, “where is this sick woman? May not a body see her?”

“Yes,” says the sister, “I believe you may, but let me go in first a little, and I’ll tell you.” So she ran up to the door, and gave me notice, and presently called to him again. “Brother,” says she, “you may come in if you please.” So in he came, just in the same kind of rant.

“Well,” says he, at the door, as he came in, “where’s this sick body that’s in love? How do ye do, Mrs. Betty?”

I would have got up out of my chair, but was so weak I could not for a good while; and he saw it, and his sister too; and she said, “Come, do not strive to stand up, my brother desires no ceremony, especially now you are so weak.”

“No, no, Mrs. Betty. Pray sit still,” says he, and so sits himself down in a chair over against me, and appeared as if he was mighty merry.

He talked a deal of rambling stuff to his sister, and to me, sometimes of one thing, sometimes another, on purpose to amuse her, and every now and then would turn it upon the old story: “Poor Mrs. Betty,” says he, “it is a sad thing to be in love, why it has reduced you sadly.”

At last I spoke a little, “I am glad to see you so merry, sir,” says I, “but I think the doctor might have found something better to do, than to make his game of his patients. If I had been ill of no other distemper, I know the proverb too well to have let him come to me.”

“What proverb?” says he: “what,





‘ Where love is the case,

The doctor’s an ass.’





Is that not it, Mrs. Betty?”

I smiled, and said nothing.

“Nay,” says he, “I think the effect has proved it to be love; for it seems the doctor has done you little service, you mend very slowly, they say. I doubt there’s somewhat in it, Mrs. Betty. I doubt you are sick of the incurables.”

I smiled and said, “No, indeed sir, that’s none of my distemper.”

We had a deal of such discourse, and sometimes others that signified as little; by and by he asked me to sing them a song; at which I smiled, and said, my singing days were over. At last he asked me, if he should play upon his flute to me. His sister said she believed my head could not bear it. I bowed, and said, “Pray, madam, do not hinder it. I love the flute very much.”

Then his sister said, “Well, do, then, brother.”

With that he pulled out the key of his closet. “Dear sister,” says he, “I am very lazy, do step and fetch my flute; it lies in such a drawer,” naming a place where he was sure it was not, that she might be a little while a-looking for it.

As soon as she was gone, he related the whole story to me of the discourse his brother had about me, and his concern about it, which was the reason of his contriving this visit. I assured him, I had never opened my mouth, either to his brother or to anybody else: I told him the dreadful exigence I was in; that my love to him, and his offering to have me forget that affection, and remove it to another, had thrown me down; and that I had a thousand times wished I might die, rather than recover, and to have the same circumstances to struggle with as I had before. I added, that I foresaw, that as soon as I was well, I must quit the family, and that as for marrying his brother, I abhorred the thoughts of it, after what had been my case with him, and that he might depend upon it I would never see his brother again upon that subject: that if he would break all his vows, and oaths, and engagements with me, be that between his conscience and himself: but he should never be able to say, that I who he had persuaded to call myself his wife, and who had given him the liberty to use me as a wife, was not as faithful to him as a wife ought to be, whatever he might be to me.

He was going to reply, and had said, that he was sorry I could not be persuaded, and was a-going to say more, but he heard his sister a-coming,and so did I; and yet I forced out these few words as a reply, “That I could never be persuaded to love one brother and marry the other.”

He shook his head, and said, “Then I am ruined,” meaning himself;and that moment his sister entered the room, and told him she could not find the flute. “Well,” says he merrily, “this laziness won’t do,” so he gets up and goes himself to look for it, but comes back without it too, not but that he could have found it, but he had no mind to play; and, besides, the errand he sent his sister on was answered another way; for he only wanted to speak to me, which he had done, though not much to his satisfaction.

I had, however, a great deal of satisfaction in having spoken my mind to him in freedom, and with such an honest plainness, as I have related;and though it did not at all work the way I desired, that is to say, to oblige the person to me the more; yet it took from him all possibility of quitting me, but by a downright breach of honour, and giving up all the faith of a gentleman which he had so often engaged by never to abandon me, but to make me his wife as soon as he came to his estate.

It was not many weeks after this, before I was about the house again, and began to grow well; but I continued melancholy and retired, which amazed the whole family, except he that knew the reason of it; yet it was a great while before he took any notice of it, and I, as backward to speak as he, carried as respectfully to him, but never offered to speak a word that was particular of any kind whatsoever; and this continued for sixteen or seventeen weeks; so that as I expected every day to be dismissed the family, on account of what distaste they had taken another way, in which I had no guilt, I expected to hear no more of this gentleman, after all his solemn vows, but to be ruined and abandoned.

At last I broke the way myself in the family, for my removing;for being talking seriously with the old lady one day, about my own circumstances, and how my distemper had left a heaviness upon my spirits; the old lady said, “I am afraid, Betty, what I have said to you about my son, has had some influence upon you, and that you are melancholy on his account; pray, will you let me know how the matter stands with you both? If it may not be improper, for as for Robin, he does nothing but rally and banter when I speak of it to him.”

“Why, truly, madam,” said I, “that matter stands as I wish it did not,and I shall be very sincere with you in it, whatever befalls me. Mr. Robin has several times proposed marriage to me, which is what I had no reason to expect, my poor circumstances considered; but I have always resisted him, and that perhaps in terms more positive than became me, considering the regard that I ought to have for every branch of your family: but,”said I, “Madam, I could never so far forget my obligations to you, and all your house, to offer to consent to a thing which I knew must needs be disobliging to you, and have positively told him that I would never entertain a thought of that kind, unless I had your consent, and his father’s also, to whom I was bound by so many invincible obligations.”

“And is this possible, Mrs. Betty?” says the old lady. “Then you have been much juster to us than we have been to you; for we have all looked upon you as a kind of a snare to my son; and I had a proposal to make you, for your removing for fear of it; but I had not yet mentioned it to you, because I was afraid of grieving you too much, lest it should throw you down again, for we have a respect for you still, though not so much as to have it be the ruin of my son; but if it be as you say, we have all wronged you very much.”

“As to the truth of what I say, madam,” said I, “I refer to your son himself, if he will do me any justice, he must tell you the story just as I have told it.”

Away goes the old lady to her daughters, and tells them the whole story, just as I had told it her, and they were surprised at it, you may be sure, as I believed they would be; one said she could never have thought it, another said Robin was a fool; a third said, she would not believe a word of it, and she would warrant that Robin would tell the story another way; but the old lady, who was resolved to go to the bottom of it, before I could have the least opportunity of acquainting her son with what had passed, resolved too, that she would talk with her son immediately, and to that purpose sent for him, for he was gone but to a lawyer’s house in the town, and upon her sending he returned immediately.

Upon his coming up to them, for they were all together, “Sit down, Robin,” says the old lady, “I must have some talk with you.”

“With all my heart, madam,” says Robin, looking very merry. “I hope it is about a good wife, for I am at a great loss in that affair.”

“How can that be,” says his mother, “did you not you say you resolved to have Mrs. Betty?”

“Ay, madam,” says Robin; “but there is one that has forbid the banns.”

“Forbid the banns, who can that be?”

“Even Mrs. Betty herself,” says Robin.

“How so,” says his mother, “have you not asked her the question then?”

“Yes, indeed, madam,” says Robin, “I have attacked her in form five times since she was sick, and am beaten off: the jade is so stout, she won’t capitulate, nor yield upon any terms except such as I can’t effectually grant.”

“Explain yourself,” says the mother, “for I am surprised, I do not understand you. I hope you are not in earnest.”

“Why, madam,” says he, “the case is plain enough upon me, it explains itself; she won’t have me, she says. Is not that plain enough? I think ’tis plain, and pretty rough too.”

“Well, but,” says the mother, “you talk of conditions, that you cannot grant. What does she want, a settlement? Her jointure ought to be according to her portion; what does she bring?”

“Nay, as to fortune,” says Robin, “she is rich enough; I am satisfied in that point; but ’tis that I am not able to come up to her terms, and she is positive she will not have me without.”

Here the sisters put in. “Madam,” says the second sister, “’tis impossible to be serious with him, he will never give a direct answer to anything; you had better let him alone, and talk no more of it, you know how to dispose of her out of his way.”

Robin was a little warmed with his sister’s rudeness, but he was even with her presently: “There are two sorts of people, madam,” says he, turning to his mother, “that there is no contending with, that is a wise body and a fool. ’Tis a little hard I should engage with both of them together.”

The younger sister then put in, “We must be fools indeed,” says she,“in my brother’s opinion, that he should make us believe he has seriously asked Mrs. Betty to marry him, and she has refused him.”

“‘Answer, and answer not,’ says Solomon,” replied her brother.“When your brother had said that he had asked her no less than five times, and that she positively denied him, methinks a younger sister need not question the truth of it, when her mother did not.”

“My mother, you see, did not understand it,” says the second sister.

“There’s some difference,” says Robin, “between desiring me to explain it, and telling me she did not believe it.”

“Well, but son,” says the old lady, “if you are disposed to let us into the mystery of it, what were those hard conditions?”

“Yes, madam,” says Robin, “I had done it before now, if the teasers here had not worried me by way of interruption. The conditions are, that I bring my father and you to consent to it, and without that, she protests. she will never see me more upon that head; and the conditions, as I said, I suppose I shall never be able to grant. I hope my warm sisters will be answered now, and blush a little.”

This answer was surprising to them all, though less to the mother, because of what I had said to her. As to the daughters they stood mute a great while; but the mother said with some passion, “Well, I heard this before, but I could not believe it, but if it is so, then we have all done Betty wrong, and she has behaved better than I expected.”

“Nay,” says the eldest sister, “if it is so, she has acted handsomely indeed.”

“I confess,” says the mother, “it was none of her fault, if he was enough fool to take a fancy to her; but to give such an answer to him, shows more respect to us than I can tell how to express; I shall value the girl the better for it, as long as I know her.”

“But I shall not,” says Robin, “unless you will give your consent.”

“I’ll consider of that awhile,” says the mother. “I assure you, if there were not some other objections, this conduct of hers would go a great way to bring me to consent.”

“I wish it would go quite through with it,” says Robin, “if you had as much thought about making me easy, as you have about making me rich, you would soon consent to it.”

“Why, Robin,” says the mother again, “are you really in earnest? Would you fain have her?”

“Really, madam,” says Robin, “I think ’tis hard you should question me again upon that head; I won’t say that I will have her, how can I resolve that point, when you see I cannot have her without your consent? But this I will say, I am earnest that I will never have anybody else, if I can help it; Betty or nobody is the word, and the question which of the two shall be in your breast to decide, madam, provided only, that my good-humoured sisters here may have no vote in it.”

All this was dreadful to me, for the mother began to yield, and Robin pressed her home in it. On the other hand, she advised with the eldest son, and he used all the arguments in the world to persuade her to consent;alleging his brother’s passionate love for me, and my generous regard to the family, in refusing my own advantages upon such a nice point of honour, and a thousand such things; and as to the father, he was a man in a hurry of public affairs, and getting money, seldom at home, thoughtful of the main chance, but left all those things to his wife.

You may easily believe, that when the plot was thus, as they thought, broke out: it was not so difficult, or so dangerous, for the elder brother, who nobody suspected of anything, to have a freer access than before. Nay, the mother, which was just as he wished, proposed it to him to talk with Mrs. Betty. “It may be, son,” said she, “you may see farther into the thing than I; and see if she has been so positive as Robin says she has been, or no.” This was as well as he could wish, and he, as it were, yielding to talk with me at his mother’s request, she brought me to him into her own chamber, told me her son had some business with me at her request, and then she left us together, and he shut the door after her.

He came back to me, and took me in his arms and kissed me very tenderly; but told me it was now come to that crisis, that I should make myself happy or miserable, as long as I lived: that if I could not comply to his desire, we should both be ruined. Then he told me the whole story between Robin, as he called him, and his mother, and his sisters, and himself, as above. “And now, dear child,” says he, “consider what it will be to marry a gentleman of a good family, in good circumstances, and with the consent of the whole house, and to enjoy all that the world can give you; and what on the other hand, to be sunk into the dark circumstances of a woman that has lost her reputation; and that though I shall be a private friend to you while I live, yet as I shall be suspected always, so you will be afraid to see me, and I shall be afraid to own you.”

He gave me no time to reply, but went on with me thus: “What has happened between us, child, so long as we both agree to do so, may be buried and forgotten: I shall always be your sincere friend, without inclination to nearer intimacy, when you become my sister; and we shall have all the honest part of conversation without any reproaches between us, of having done amiss: I beg of you to consider it, and do not stand in the way of your own safety and prosperity; and to satisfy you that I am sincere,” added he, “I here offer you five hundred pounds to make you some amends for the freedoms I have taken with you, which we shall look upon as some of the follies of our lives, which ’tis hoped we may repent of.”

He spoke this in so much more moving terms than it is possible for me to express, that you may suppose as he held me above an hour and a half in this discourse, so he answered all my objections, and fortified his discourse with all the arguments that human wit and art could devise.

I cannot say, however, that anything he said made impression enough upon me, so as to give me any thought of the matter, till he told me at last very plainly, that if I refused, he was sorry to add, that he could never go on with me in that station as we stood before; that though he loved me as well as ever, and that I was as agreeable to him; yet the sense of virtue had not so forsaken him as to suffer him to lie with a woman that his brother courted to make his wife; that if he took his leave of me, with a denial from me in this affair, whatever he might do for me in the point of support, grounded on his first engagement of maintaining me, yet he would not have me be surprised, that he was obliged to tell me, he could not allow himself to see me any more, and that indeed I could not expect it of him.

I received this last part with some tokens of surprise and disorder, and had much ado to avoid sinking down, for indeed I loved him to an extravagance not easy to imagine; but he perceived my disorder, and entreated me to consider seriously of it, assured me that it was the only way to preserve our mutual affection; that in this station we might love as friends, with the utmost passion, and with a love of relation untainted, free from our own just reproaches, and free from other people’s suspicions:that he should ever acknowledge his happiness owing to me; that he would be debtor to me as long as he lived, and would be paying that debt as long as he had breath. Thus he wrought me up, in short, to a kind of hesitation in the matter; having the dangers on one side represented in lively figures, and indeed heightened by my imagination of being turned out to the wide world, a mere cast-off whore, for it was no less, and perhaps exposed as such; with little to provide for myself; with no friend, no acquaintance in the whole world, out of that town, and there I could not pretend to stay; all this terrified me to the last degree, and he took care upon all occasions to lay it home to me, in the worst colours; on the other hand, he failed not to set forth the easy prosperous life, which I was going to live.

He answered all that I could object from affection, and from former engagements, with telling me the necessity that was before us of taking other measures now; and as to his promises of marriage, the nature of things, he said, had put an end of that, by the probability of my being his brother’s wife, before the time to which his promises all referred.

Thus, in a word, I may say, he reasoned me out of my reason; he conquered all my arguments, and I began to see a danger that I was in, which I had not considered of before, and that was, of being dropped by both of them, and left alone in the world to shift for myself.

This, and his persuasion, at length prevailed with me to consent, though with so much reluctance, that it was easy to see I should go to church like a bear to the stake; I had some little apprehensions about me too, lest my new spouse, who, by the way, I had not the least affection for, should be skilful enough to challenge me on another account, upon our first coming to bed together; but whether he did it with design or not, I know not; but his elder brother took care to make him very much fuddled before he went to bed, so that I had the satisfaction of a drunken bedfellow the first night. How he did it I know not, but I concluded that he certainly contrived it, that his brother might be able to make no judgment of the difference between a maid and a married woman, nor did he ever entertain any notions of it, or disturb his thoughts about it.

I should go back a little here, to where I left off. The elder brother having thus managed me, his next business was to manage his mother, and he never left till he had brought her to acquiesce and be passive even without acquainting the father, other than by post letters: so that she consented to our marrying privately, leaving her to manage the father afterwards.

Then he cajoled with his brother, and persuaded him what service he had done him, and how he had brought his mother to consent, which though true, was not indeed done to serve him, but to serve himself; but thus diligently did he cheat him, and had the thanks of a faithful friend for shifting off his whore into his brother’s arms for a wife. So naturally do men give up honour and justice and even Christianity to secure themselves.

I must now come back to Brother Robin, as we always called him, who having got his mother’s consent, as above, came big with the news to me, and told me the whole story of it, with a sincerity so visible, that I must confess it grieved me that I must be the instrument to abuse so honest a gentleman; but there was no remedy, he would have me, and I was not obliged to tell him that I was his brother’s whore, though I had no other way to put him off; so I came gradually into it, and behold we were married.

Modesty forbids me to reveal the secrets of the marriage bed, but nothing could have happened more suitable to my circumstances than that, as above, my husband was so fuddled when he came to bed, that he could not remember in the morning, whether he had had any conservation with me or no, and I was obliged to tell him he had, though in reality he had not, that I might be sure he could make no inquiry about anything else.

It concerns the story in hand very little to enter into the farther particulars of the family, or of myself, for the five years that I lived with this husband, only to observe that I had two children by him, and that at the end of the five years he died. He had been really a very good husband to me, and we lived very agreeably together; but as he had not received much from them, and had in the little time he lived acquired no great matters, so my circumstances were not great, nor was I much mended by the match. Indeed, I had preserved the elder brother’s bonds to me, to pay me £500, which he offered me for my consent to marry his brother; and this, with what I had saved of the money he formerly gave me, and about as much more by my husband, left me a widow with about £1,200 in my pocket.

My two children were indeed taken happily off of my hands, by my husband’s father and mother, and that was all they got by Mrs. Betty.

I confess I was not suitably affected with the loss of my husband; nor can I say that I ever loved him as I ought to have done, or was suitable to the good usage I had from him, for he was a tender, kind, good-humoured man as any woman could desire; but his brother being so always in my sight, at least while we were in the country, was a continual snare to me;and I never was in bed with my husband, but I wished myself in the arms of his brother; and though his brother never offered me the least kindness that way, after our marriage, but carried it just as a brother ought to do; yet it was impossible for me to do so to him: in short, I committed adultery and incest with him every day in my desires, which without doubt was as effectually criminal.

Before my husband died, his elder brother was married, and we being then removed to London, were written to by the old lady to come and be at the wedding; my husband went, but I pretended indisposition, so I stayed behind; for, in short, I could not bear the sight of his being given to another woman, though I knew I was never to have him myself.

I was now, as above, left loose to the world, and being still young and handsome, as everybody said of me, and I assure you I thought myself so, and with a tolerable fortune in my pocket, I put no small value upon myself. I was courted by several very considerable tradesmen, and particularly very warmly by one, a linen draper, at whose house, after my husband’s death, I took a lodging, his sister being my acquaintance; here I had all the liberty and opportunity to be gay, and appear in company that I could desire; my landlord’s sister being one of the maddest, gayest things alive, and not so much mistress of her virtue as I thought at first she had been. She brought me into a world of wild company, and even brought home several persons, such as she liked well enough to gratify, to see her pretty widow. Now, as fame and fools make an assembly, I was here wonderfully caressed; had abundance of admirers, and such as called themselves lovers; but I found not one fair proposal among them all; as for their common design, that I understood too well to be drawn into any more snares of that kind. The case was altered with me, I had money in my pocket, and had nothing to say to them. I had been tricked once by that cheat called love, but the game was over. I was resolved now to be married or nothing, and to be well married or not at all.

I loved the company, indeed, of men of mirth and wit, and was often entertained with such, as I was also with others; but I found by just observation, that the brightest men came upon the dullest errand, that is to say, the dullest as to what I aimed at; on the other hand, those who came with the best proposals were the dullest and most disagreeable part of the world. I was not averse to a tradesman, but then I would have a tradesman, forsooth, that was something of a gentleman too; that when my husband had a mind to carry me to the court, or to the play, he might become a sword, and look as like a gentleman as another man; and not like one that had the mark of his apron-strings upon his coat, or the mark of his hat upon his periwig; that should look as if he was set on to his sword, when his sword was put on to him, and that carried his trade in his countenance.

Well, at last I found this amphibious creature, this land-water thing, called a gentleman-tradesman, and as a just plague upon my folly, I was catched in the very snare which, as I might say, I laid for myself.

This was a draper too, for though my comrade would have bargained for me with her brother; yet when they came to the point, it was it seems for a mistress, and I kept true to this notion, that a woman should never be kept for a mistress, that had money to make herself a wife.

Thus my pride, not my principle, my money, not my virtue, kept me honest; though, as it proved, I found I had much better have been sold by my she-comrade, to her brother, than have sold myself as I did to a tradesman that was rake, gentleman, shopkeeper, and beggar all together.

But I was hurried on (by my fancy to a gentleman) to ruin myself in the grossest manner that ever woman did; for my new husband, coming to a lump of money at once, fell into such a profusion of expense, that all I had, and all he had, would not have held it out above one year.

He was very fond of me for about a quarter of a year, and what I got by that, was, that I had the pleasure of seeing a great deal of my money spent upon myself. “Come, my dear,” says he to me one day, “shall we go and take a turn into the country for a week?”

“Ay, my dear,” says I. “Whither would you go?”

“I care not whither,” says he; “but I have a mind to look like quality for a week, we’ll go to Oxford,” says he.

“How,” says I, “shall we go? I am no horse-woman, and ’tis too far for a coach.”

“Too far?” says he; “no place is too far for a coach and six. If I carry you out, you shall travel like a duchess.”

“Hum,” says I, “my dear, ’tis a frolic, but if you have a mind to it, I don’t care.”

Well, the time was appointed, we had a rich coach, very good horses, a coachman, postillion, and two footmen in very good liveries; a gentleman on horseback, and a page with a feather in his hat upon another horse; the servants all called him “My Lord,” and I was “Her Honour, the Countess,” and thus we travelled to Oxford, and a pleasant journey we had; for give him his due, not a beggar alive knew better how to be a lord than my husband. We saw all the rarities at Oxford, talked with two or three fellows of Colleges, about putting a nephew, that was left to his lordship’s care, to the University, and of their being his tutors; we diverted ourselves with bantering several other poor scholars, with the hopes of being at least his lordship’s chaplain and putting on a scarf; and thus having lived like quality indeed, as to expense, we went away for Northampton, and in a word, in about twelve days’ ramble came home again, to the tune of about £93 expense.

Vanity is the perfection of a fop; my husband had this excellence, that he valued nothing of expense; as his history, you may he sure, has very little weight in it, ’tis enough to tell you that in about two years and a quarter he broke, got into a Spunging-House, being arrested in an action too heavy for him to give bail, so he sent for me to come to him.

It was no surprise to me, for I had foreseen something before that all was going to wreck, and had been taking care to reserve something if I could for myself. But when he sent for me, he behaved much better than I expected: he told me plainly, he had played the fool, and suffered himself to be surprised, which he might have prevented: that now he foresaw he could not stand it, and therefore he would have me go home, and in the night take away everything I had in the house of any value, and secure it;and alter that, he told me, that if I could get away £100 or £200 in goods out of the shop, I should do it. “Only,” says he, “let me know nothing of it, neither what you take, or whither you carry it; for as for me,” says he, “I am resolved to get out of this house and be gone; and if you never hear of me more, my dear,” says he, “I wish you well; I am only sorry for the injury I have done you.” He said some very handsome things to me indeed at parting; for I told you he was a gentleman, and that was all the benefit I had of his being so; that he used me very handsomely, even to the last, only spent all I had, and left me to rob the creditors for something to subsist on.

However, I did as he bade me, that you may be sure, and having thus taken my leave of him I never saw him more; for he found means to break out of the bailiff’s house that night or the next: how I knew not, for I could come at no knowledge of anything more than this, that he came home about three o’clock in the morning, caused the rest of his goods to be removed into the Mint and the shop to be shut up; and having raised what money he could he got over to France, from whence I had one or two letters from him and no more.

I did not see him when he came home, for he having given me such instructions as above and I having made the best of my time, I had no more business back again at the house, not knowing but I might have been stopped there by the creditors; for a Commission of Bankrupt being soon after issued, they might have stopped me by orders from the Commisioners. But my husband having desperately got out from the bailiff’s by letting himself down from almost the top of the house to the top of another building and leaping from thence, which was almost two stories, and which was enough indeed to have broken his neck: he came home and got away his goods before the creditors could come to seize, that is to say, before they could get out the commission and be ready to send their officers to take possession.

My husband was so civil to me, for still I say he was much of a gentleman, that in the first letter he wrote me he let me know where he had pawned twenty pieces of fine holland for £30 which were worth above £90, and enclosed me the token for the taking them up, paying the money, which I did, and made in time above £100 of them, having leisure to cut them and sell them to private families, as opportunity offered.

However, with all this and all that I had secured before, I found upon casting things up, my case was very much altered and my fortune much lessened; for including the hollands and a parcel of fine muslins, which I carried off before, and some plate and other things, I found I could hardly muster up £500, and my condition was very odd, for though I had no child (I had had one by my gentleman draper but it was buried), yet I was a widow bewitched, I had a husband and no husband, and I could not pretend to marry again, though I knew well enough my husband would never see England any more, if he lived fifty years. Thus, I say, I was limited from marriage, what offer soever might be made me; and I had not one friend to advise with in the condition I was in, at least, not one who I could trust the secret of my circumstances to, for if the commissioners were to have been informed where I was, I should have been fetched up and all I had saved be taken away.

Upon these apprehensions the first thing I did was to go quite out of my knowledge, and go by another name. This I did effectually, for I went into the Mint too, took lodgings in a very private place, dressed me up in the habit of a widow, and called myself Mrs. Flanders.

Here, however, I concealed myself and though my new acquaintance knew nothing of me, yet I soon got a great deal of company about me; and whether it be that women are scarce among the people that generally are to be found there, or that some consolations in the miseries of that place are more requisite than on other occasions, I soon found that an agreeable woman was exceedingly valuable among the sons of affliction there; and that those that could not pay half a crown in the pound to their creditors and run in debt at the Sign of the Bull for their dinners, would yet find money for a supper if they liked the woman.

However, I kept myself safe yet, though I began, like my Lord Rochester’s mistress that loved his company but would not admit him farther, to have the scandal of a whore without the joy; and upon this score, tired with the place and with the company too, I began to think of removing.

It was indeed a subject of strange reflection to me to see men in the most perplexed circumstances, who were reduced some degrees below being ruined, whose families were objects of their own terror and other people’s charity; yet while a penny lasted, nay, even beyond it, endeavouring to drown their sorrow in their wickedness; heaping up more guilt upon themselves, labouring to forget former things, which now it was the proper time to remember, making more work for repentance, and sinning on as a remedy for sin past.

But it is none of my talent to preach; these men were too wicked even for me; there was something horrid and absurd in their way of sinning, for it was all a force even upon themselves; they did not only act against conscience, but against nature, and nothing was more easy than to see how sighs would interrupt their songs, and paleness and anguish sit upon their brows in spite of the forced smiles they put on; nay, sometimes it would break out at their very mouths, when they had parted with their money for a lewd treat or a wicked embrace; I have heard them, turning about, fetch a deep sigh, and cry “What a dog am I! Well, Betty, my dear, I’ll drink thy health, though,” meaning the honest wife, that perhaps had not half a crown for herself, and three or four children. The next morning they were at their penitentials again, and perhaps the poor weeping wife comes over to him, either brings him some account of what his creditors are doing and how she and the children are turned out of doors, or some other dreadful news, and this adds to his self-reproaches; but when he has thought and pored on it till he is almost mad, having no principles to support him, nothing within him, or above him, to comfort him; but finding it all darkness on every side, he flies to the same relief again, viz., to drink it away, debauch it away, and falling into company of men in just the same condition with himself, he repeats the crime, and thus he goes every day one step onward of his way to destruction.

I was not wicked enough for such fellows as these yet, on the contrary, I began to consider here very seriously what I had to do; how things stood with me, and what course I ought to take. I knew I had no friends, no not one friend or relation in the world; and that little I had left apparently wasted, which when it was gone, I saw nothing but misery and starving was before me. Upon these considerations, I say, and filled with horror at the place I was in, I resolved to be gone.

I had made an acquaintance with a sober good sort of a woman, who was a widow too, like me, but in better circumstances; her husband had been a captain of a ship, and having had the misfortune to be cast away coming home from the West Indies, was so reduced by the loss that though he had saved his life then, it broke his heart and killed him afterwards, and his widow being pursued by the creditors was forced to take shelter in the Mint. She soon made things up with the help of friends, and was at liberty again; and finding that I rather was there to be concealed than by any particular prosecutions, and finding also that I agreed with her, or rather she with me, in a just abhorrence of the place and of the company, she invited me to go home with her till I could put myself in some posture of settling in the world to my mind; withal telling me that it was ten to one but some good captain of a ship might take a fancy to me and court me, in that part of the town where she lived.

I accepted of her offer and was with her half a year, and should have been longer, but in that interval what she proposed to me happened to herself, and she married very much to her advantage; but whose fortune soever was upon the increase mine seemed to be upon the wane, and I found nothing present except two or three boatswains, or such fellows; but as for the commanders they were generally of two sorts. 1. Such as having good business, that is to say, a good ship, resolved not to marry but with advantage. 2. Such as being out of employ wanted a wife to help them to a ship. I mean, (1) a wife, who having some money could enable them to hold a good part of a ship themselves, so to encourage owners to come in;or (2) a wife, who if she had not money had friends who were concerned in shipping, and so could help to put the young man into a good ship, and neither of these was my case; so I looked like one that was to lie on hand.

This knowledge I soon learned by experience, viz., that the state of things was altered, as to matrimony, that marriages were here the consequences of politic schemes for forming interests, carrying on business,and that love had no share or but very little in the matter.

That, as my sister-in-law at Colchester had said, beauty, wit, manners, sense, good humour, good behaviour, education, virtue, piety,or any other qualification, whether of body or mind, had no power to recommend; that money only made a woman agreeable; that men chose mistresses indeed by the gust of their affection, and it was requisite for a whore to be handsome, well-shaped, have a good mien, and a graceful behaviour; but that for a wife, no deformity would shock the fancy, no ill qualities the judgment; the money was the thing; the portion was neither crooked nor monstrous, but the money was always agreeable, whatever the wife was.

On the other hand, as the market run all on the men’s side, I found the women had lost the privilege of saying “No”; that it was a favour now for a woman to have the question asked, and if any young lady had so much arrogance as to counterfeit a negative, she never had the opportunity of denying twice; much less of recovering that false step and accepting what she had seemed to decline. The men had such choice everywhere, that the case of the women was very unhappy; for they seemed to ply at every door, and if the man was by great chance refused at one house he was sure to be received at the next.

Besides this, I observed that the men made no scruple to set themselves out and to go a fortune hunting, as they call it, when they had really no fortune themselves to demand it or merit to deserve it; and they carried it so high, that a woman was scarce allowed to enquire after the character or estate of the person that pretended to her. This I had an example of in a young lady at the next house to me, and with whom I had contracted an intimacy; she was courted by a young captain, and though she had near £2,000 to her fortune, she did but enquire of some of his neighbours about his character, his morals, or substance; and he took occasion at the next visit to let her know, truly, that he took it very ill, and that he should not give her the trouble of his visits any more. I heard of it, and I had begun my acquaintance with her, I went to see her upon it. She entered into a close conversation with me about it, and unbosomed herself very freely. I perceived presently that though she thought herself very ill used, yet she had no power to resent it; that she was exceedingly piqued she had lost him, and particularly that another of less fortune had gained him.

I fortified her mind against such a meanness, as I called it. I told her that as low as I was in the world, I would have despised a man that should think I ought to take him upon his own recommendation only; also I told her that as she had a good fortune, she had no need to stoop to the disaster of the times; that it was enough that the men could insult us that had but little money, but if she suffered such an affront to pass upon her without resenting it she would be rendered low-prized upon all occasions, that a woman can never want an opportunity to be revenged of a man that has used her ill, and that there were ways enough to humble such a fellow as that or else certainly women were the most unhappy creatures in the world.

She was very well pleased with the discourse, and told me seriously that she would be very glad to make him sensible of her resentment, and either to bring him on again, or have the satisfaction of her revenge being as public as possible.

I told her that if she would take my advice, I would tell her how she should obtain her wishes in both those things; and that I would engage I would bring the man to her door again and make him beg to be let in. She smiled at that, and soon let me see that if he came to her door, her resentment was not so great to let him stand long there.

However, she listened very willingly to my offer of advice; so I told her that the first thing she ought to do was a piece of justice to herself, viz., that whereas he had reported among the ladies that he had left her, and pretended to give the advantage of the negative to himself, she should take care to have it well spread among the women, which she could not fail of an opportunity to do, that she had enquired into his circumstances and found he was not the man he pretended to be. “Let them be told, too, madam,” said I, “that you found he was not the man you expected and that you thought it was not safe to meddle with him, that you heard he was of an ill temper, and that he boasted how he had used the women ill upon many occasions, and that particularly he was debauched in his morals, et cetera.” The last of which indeed had some truth in it; but I did not find that she seemed to like him much the worse for that part.

She came most readily into all this, and immediately she went to work to find instruments she had very little difficulty in the search; for telling her story in general to a couple of her gossips, it was the chat of the tea table all over that part of the town, and I met with it wherever I visited; also, as it was known that I was acquainted with the young lady herself, my opinion was asked very often, and I confirmed it with all the necessary aggravations, and set out his character in the blackest colours;and as a piece of secret intelligence, I added what the gossips knew nothing of, viz., that I had heard he was in very bad circumstances; that he was under a necessity of a fortune to support his interest with the owners of the ship he commanded; that his own part was not paid for, and if it was not paid quickly, his owners would put him out of the ship, and his chief mate was likely to command it, who offered to buy that part which the captain had promised to take.

I added, for I was heartily piqued at the rogue as I called him, that I had heard a rumour too, that he had a wife alive at Plymouth and another in the West Indies, a thing which they all knew was not uncommon for such kind of gentlemen.

This worked as we both desired it, for presently the young lady at the next door, who had a father and mother that governed both her and her fortune, was shut up, and her father forbid him the house: also in one place more the woman had the courage, however strange it was, to say“No”; and he could try nowhere but he was reproached with his pride, and that he pretended not to give the women leave to enquire into his character, and the like.

By this time he began to be sensible of this mistake; and seeing all the women on that side the water alarmed, he went over to Ratcliff and got access to some of the ladies there; but though the young women there too were according to the fate of the day pretty willing to be asked, yet such was his ill luck, that his character followed him over the water; so that though he might have had wives enough, yet it did not happen among the women that had good fortunes, which was what he wanted.

But this was not all; she very ingeniously managed another thing herself, for she got a young gentleman who was a relation to come and visit her two or three times a week in a very fine chariot and good liveries, and her two agents and I also presently spread a report all over that this gentleman came to court her; that he was a gentleman of a thousand pounds a year, and that he was fallen in love with her, and that she was going to her aunt’s in the City, because it was inconvenient for the gentleman to come to her with his coach to Rotherhithe, the streets being so narrow and difficult.

This took immediately, the captain was laughed at in all companies, and was ready to hang himself; he tried all the ways possible to come at her again, and wrote the most passionate letters to her in the world, and, in short, by great application, obtained leave to wait on her again, as he said, only to clear his reputation.

At this meeting she had her full revenge of him; for she told him she wondered what he took her to be, that she should admit any man to a treaty of so much consequence as that of marriage, without enquiring into his circumstances; that if he thought she was to be huffed into wedlock, and that she was in the same circumstances which her neighbours might be in, viz., to take up with the first good Christian that came, he was mistaken; that in a word his character was really bad, or he was very ill beholden to his neighbours; and that unless he could clear up some points in which she had justly been prejudiced she had no more to say to him, but give him the satisfaction of knowing that she was not afraid to say “No”either to him, or any man else.

With that she told him what she had heard, or rather raised herself by my means, of his character; his not having paid for the part he pretended to own of the ship he commanded; of the resolution of his owners to put him out of the command, and to put his mate in his stead; and of the scandal raised on his morals; his having been reproached with such and such women, and his having a wife at Plymouth and another in the West Indies, and the like; and she asked him whether she had not good reason, if these things were not cleared up, to refuse him and to insist upon having satisfaction in points so significant as they were?

He was so confounded at her discourse that he could not answer a word, and she began to believe that all was true by his disorder, though she knew that she had been the raiser of those reports herself.

After some time he recovered a little, and from that time was the most humble, modest, and importunate man alive in his courtship.

She asked him if he thought she was so at her last shift that she could or ought to bear such treatment, and if he did not see that she did not want those who thought it worth their while to come farther to her than he did, meaning the gentleman whom she had brought to visit her by way of sham.

She brought him by these tricks to submit to all possible measures to satisfy her, as well of his circumstances as of his behaviour. He brought her undeniable evidence of his having paid for his part of the ship; he brought her certificates from his owners that the report of their intending to remove him from the command of the ship was false and groundless; in short, he was quite the reverse of what he was before.

Thus I convinced her that if the men made their advantage of our sex in the affair of marriage upon the supposition of there being such a choice to be had, and of the women being so easy, it was only owing to this, that the women wanted courage to maintain their ground, and that according to my Lord Rochester





“A woman’s ne’er so ruined but she can

Revenge herself on her undoer, man.”





After these things this young lady played her part so well, that though she resolved to have him, and that indeed having him was the main bent of her design,yet she made his obtaining her to be to him the most difficult thing in the world; and this she did, not by a haughty reserved carriage, but by a just policy, playing back upon him his own game; for as he pretended, by a kind of lofty carriage to place himself above the occasion of a character, she broke with him upon that subject, and at the same time that she made him submit to all possible enquiry after his affairs, she apparently shut the door against his looking into her own.

It was enough to him to obtain her for a wife; as to what she had, she told him plainly that as he knew her circumstances it was but just she should know his; and though at the same time he had only known her circumstances by common fame, yet he had made so many protestations of his passion for her that he could ask no more but her hand to his grand request, and the like ramble according to the custom of lovers: in short, he left himself no room to ask any more questions about her estate, and she took the advantage of it; for she placed part of her fortune so in trustees,without letting him know anything of it, that it was quite out of his reach, and made him very well contented with the rest.

It is true she was pretty well besides, that is to say, she had about £1 400 in money which she gave him, and the other, after some time, she brought to light as a perquisite to herself, which he was to accept as a mighty favour, seeing, though it was not to be his, it might ease him in the article of her particular expenses; and I must add that by this conduct the gentleman himself became not only more humble in his applications to her to obtain her, but also was much the more an obliging husband when he had her. I cannot but remind the ladies how much they place themselves below the common station of a wife, which if I may be allowed not to be partial, is low enough already; I say, they place themselves below their common station, and prepare their own mortifications, by their submitting so to be insulted by the men beforehand, which I confess I see no necessity of.

This relation may serve therefore to let the ladies see that the advantage is not so much on the other side as the men think it is; and that though it may be true the men have but too much choice among us, and that some women may be found who will dishonour themselves, be cheap, and too easy to come at; yet if they will have women worth having they may find them as uncome-at-table a’s ever; and that those that are otherwise have often such deficiencies when had, as rather recommend the ladies that are difficult, than encourage the men to go on with their easy courtship and expect wives equally valuable that will come at first call.

Nothing is more certain than that the ladies always gain of the men by keeping their ground and letting their pretended lovers see they can resent being slighted, and that they are not afraid of saying. “No.” They insult us mightily with telling us of the number of women; that the wars and the sea, and trade, and other incidents have carried the men so much away that there is no proportion between the numbers of the sexes; but I am far from granting that the number of the women is so great, or the number of the men so small; but if they will have me tell the truth, the disadvantage of the women is a terrible scandal upon the men, and it lies here only, viz., that the age is so wicked, and the sex so debauched, that in short, the number of such men as an honest woman ought to meddle with is small indeed; and it is but here and there that a man is to be found who is fit for an honest woman to venture upon.

But the consequence even of that too amounts to no more than this, that women ought to be the more nice; for how do we know the just character of the man that makes the offer? To say that the woman should be the more easy on this occasion is to say we should be the forwarder to venture, because of the greatness of the danger, which is very absurd.

On the contrary, the women have ten thousand times the more reason to be wary and backward, by how much the hazard of being betrayed is the greater, and would the ladies act the wary part, they would discover every cheat that offered; for, in short, the lives of very few men now-a-days will bear a character; and if the ladies do but make a little enquiry, they would soon be able to distinguish the men and deliver themselves:as for women that do not think their own safety worth their own thought, that impatient of their present state run into matrimony as a horse rushes into the battle, I can say nothing to them but this, that they are a sort of ladies that are to be prayed for among the rest of distempered people, and they look like people that venture their estates in a lottery where there is a hundred thousand blanks to one prize.

No man of common sense will value a woman the less for not giving up herself at the first attack, or for not accepting his proposal without enquiring into his person or character; on the contrary, he must think her the weakest of all creatures, as the rate of men now goes: in short, he must have a very contemptible opinion of her capacities, that having but one cast for her life shall cast that life away at once, and make matrimony like death, be a leap in the dark.

I would fain have the conduct of my sex a little regulated in this particular, which is the same thing in which of all the parts of life I think at this time we suffer most in: ’tis nothing but lack of courage, the fear of not being married at all, and of that frightful state of life, called an old maid. This, I say, is the woman’s snare; but would the ladies once but get above that fear and manage rightly, they would more certainly avoid it by standing their ground in a case so absolutely necessary to their felicity, than by exposing themselves as they do; and if they did not marry so soon,they would make themselves amends by marrying safer; she is always married too soon who gets a bad husband, and she is never married too late who gets a good one: in a word, there is no woman, deformity or lost reputation excepted, but if she manages well may be married safely one time or other; but if she precipitates herself it is ten thousand to one but she is undone.

But I come now to my own case, in which there was at this time no little nicety. The circumstances I was in made the offer of a good husband the most necessary thing in the world to me; but I found soon that to be made cheap and easy, was not the way: it soon began to be found that the widow had no fortune, and to say this was to say all that was ill of me, being well bred, handsome, witty, modest, and agreeable;all which I had allowed to my character, whether justly or no is not to the purpose: I say, all these would not do without the dross. In short, the widow, they said, had no money!

I resolved therefore that it was necessary to change my station and make a new appearance in some other place, and even to pass by another name if I found occasion.

I communicated my thoughts to my intimate friend the captain’s lady, who I had so faithfully served in her case with the captain, and who was as ready to serve me in the same kind as I could desire: I made no scruple to lay my circumstances open to her; my stock was but low, for I had made but about £540 at the close of my last affair, and I had wasted some of that: however, I had about £460 left, a great many very rich clothes, a gold watch and some jewels, though of no extraordinary value, and about £30 or £40 left in linen not disposed of.

My dear and faithful friend, the captain’s wife, was so sensible of the service I had done her in the affair above that she was not only a steady friend to me, but knowing my circumstances she frequently made me presents as money came into her hands; such as fully amounted to a maintenance, so that I spent none of my own; and at last she made this unhappy proposal to me, viz., that as we had observed, as above, how the men made no scruple to set themselves out as persons meriting a woman of fortune of their own, it was but just to deal with them in their own way, and if it was possible to deceive the deceiver.

The captain’s lady, in short, put this project into my head, and told me if I would be ruled by her I should certainly get a husband of fortune without leaving him any room to reproach me with want of my own. I told her that I would give up myself wholly to her directions, and that I would have neither tongue to speak, or feet to step in that affair, but as she should direct me; depending that she would extricate me out of every difficulty that she brought me into, which she said she would answer for.

The first step she put me upon was to call her cousin, and go to a relation’s house of hers in the country where she directed me, and where she brought her husband to visit me, and calling me cousin, she worked matters so about that her husband and she together invited me most passionately to come to town and live with them, for they now lived in a quite different place from where they were before. In the next place she tells her husband that I had at least £1,500 fortune, and that I was like to have a great deal more.

It was enough to tell her husband this, there needed nothing on my side; I was but to sit still and wait the event, for it presently went all over the neighbourhood that the young widow at Captain —’s was a fortune, that she had at least £1,500, and perhaps a great deal more, and that the captain said so, and if the captain was asked at any time about me he made no scruple to affirm it, though he knew not one word of the matter other than that his wife had told him so; and in this he thought no harm, for he really believed it to be so. With the reputation of this fortune, I presently found myself blessed with admirers enough, and that I had my choice of men, as they said they were, which, by the way, confirms what I was saying before: this being my case, I who had a subtle game to play, had nothing now to do but to single out from them all the properest man that might be for my purpose; that is to say, the man who was most likely to depend upon the hearsay of fortune, and not enquire too far into the particulars; and unless I did this I did nothing, for my case would not bear much enquiry.

I picked out my man without much difficulty by the judgment I made of his way of courting me: I had let him run on with his protestations that he loved me above all the world; that if I would make him happy, that was enough; all which I knew was upon supposition that I was very rich,though I never told him a word of it myself.

This was my man, but I was to try him to the bottom, and indeed in that consisted my safety, for if he balked I knew I was undone as surely as he was undone if he took me; and if I did not make some scruple about his fortune, it was the way to lead him to raise some about mine; and first therefore, I pretended on all occasions to doubt his sincerity, and told him perhaps he only courted me for my fortune; he stopped my mouth in that part with the thunder of his protestations as above, but still I pretended to doubt.

One morning he pulls off his diamond ring, and writes upon the glass of the sash in my chamber this line:





You I love, and you alone.





I read it and asked him to lend me the ring, with which I wrote under it thus,





And so in love says everyone.





He takes his ring again, and writes another line thus,

Virtue alone is an estate.





I borrowed it again and I wrote under it,





But money’s virtue, gold is fate.





He coloured as red as fire to see me turn so quick upon him, and in a kind of rage told me he would conquer me, and wrote again thus,





I scorn your gold, and yet I love.





I ventured all upon the last cast of poetry, as you’ll see, for I wrote boldly under his last, I’m poor: let’s see how kind you’ll prove.

This was a sad truth to me, whether he believed me or no I could not tell; I supposed then that he did not. However he flew to me, took me in his arms, and kissing me very eagerly, and with the greatest passion imaginable, he held me fast till he called for a pen and ink, and told me he could not wait the tedious writing on a glass, but pulling out a piece of paper he began and wrote again,





Be mine with all your poverty.





I took his pen, and followed immediately thus,





Yet secretly you hope I lie.





He told me that was unkind because it was not just, and that I put him upon contradicting me, which did not consist with good manners, and therefore since I had insensibly drawn him into this poetical scribble, he begged I would not oblige him to break it off, so he writes again,





Let love alone be our debate.





I wrote again,





She loves enough that does not hate.





This he took for a favour, and so laid down the cudgels, that is to say, the pen; I say he took it for a favour, and a mighty one it was if he had known all: however, he took it as I meant it, that is, to let him think I was inclined to go on with him, as indeed I had reason to do, for he was the best-humoured merry sort of a fellow that I ever met with; and I often reflected how doubly criminal it was to deceive such a man; but that necessity which pressed me to a settlement suitable to my condition was my authority for it, and certainly his affection to me and the goodness of his temper, however they might argue against using him ill, yet they strongly argued to me that he would better take the disappointment than some fiery-tempered wretch, who might have nothing to recommend him but those passions which would serve only to make a woman miserable.

Besides, though I had jested with him (as he supposed it) so often about my poverty, yet when he found it to be true, he had foreclosed all manner of objection, seeing, whether he was in jest or in earnest, he had declared he took me without any regard to my portion, and, whether I was in jest or in earnest, I had declared myself to be very poor, so that, in a word, I had him fast both ways; and though he might say afterwards he was cheated yet he could never say that I had cheated him.

He pursued me close after this, and, as I saw there was no need to fear losing him, I played the indifferent part with him longer than prudence might otherwise have dictated to me: but I considered how much this caution and indifference would give me the advantage over him when I should come to own my circumstances to him; and I managed it the more warily because I found he inferred from thence that I had either the more money or the more judgment, and would not venture at all.

I took the freedom one day to tell him that it was true I had received the compliment of a lover from him, viz., that he would take me without enquiring into my fortune, and I would make him a suitable return in this, viz., that I would make as little enquiry into his as consisted with reason, but I hoped he would allow me to ask some questions which he should answer or not as he thought fit; one of these questions related to our manner of living, and the place where, because I had heard he had a great plantation in Virginia, and I told him I did not care to be transported.

He began from this discourse to let me voluntarily into all his affairs, and to tell me in a frank open way all his circumstances, by which I found he was very well to pass in the world; but that great part of his estate consisted of three plantations which he had in Virginia, which brought him in a very good income of about £300 a year; but that if he was to live on them, would bring him in four times as much. Very well, thought I, you shall carry me thither then as soon as you please, though I won’t tell you so beforehand.

I jested with him about the figure he would make in Virginia; but found he would do anything I desired, so I turned my tale. I told him I had good reason not to desire to go there to live, because if his plantations were worth so much there, I had not a fortune suitable to a gentleman of £1,200 a year, as he said his estate would be.

He replied he did not ask what my fortune was, he had told me from the beginning he would not, and he would be as good as his word; but whatever it was, he assured me he would never desire me to go to Virginia with him, or go thither himself without me, unless I made it my choice.

All this, you may be sure, was as I wished, and indeed nothing could have happened more perfectly agreeable; I carried it on as far as this with a sort of indifferency that he often wondered at, and I mention it the rather to intimate again to the ladies that nothing but want of courage for such an indifferency makes our sex so cheap, and prepares them to be ill used as they are; would they venture the loss of a pretending fop now and then, who carries it high upon the point of his own merit, they would certainly be slighted less and courted more; had I discovered really what my great fortune was, and that in all I had not full £500 when he expected £1,500, yet I hooked him so fast and played with him so long, that I was satisfied he would have had me in my worst circumstances; and indeed it was less a surprise to him when he learnt the truth than it would have been, because having not the least blame to lay on me who had carried it with an air of indifference to the last, he could not say one word except that indeed he thought it had been more, but that if it had been less, he did not repent his bargain; only that he should not be able to maintain me so well as he intended.

In short, we were married, and very happily married on my side, I assure you, as to the man; for he was the best humoured man that ever woman had, but his circumstances were not so good as I imagined, as on the other hand he had not bettered himself so much as he expected.

When we were married I was shrewdly put to it to bring him that little stock I had, and to let him see it was no more; but there was a necessity for it, so I took my opportunity one day when we were alone to enter into a short dialogue with him about it. “My dear,” said I, “we have been married a fortnight, is it not time to let you know whether you have got a wife with something or with nothing?”

“Your own time for that, my dear,” says he; “I am satisfied I have got the wife I love; I have not troubled you much,” says he, “with my enquiry after it.”

“That’s true,” said I, “but I have a great difficulty about it, which I scarce know how to manage.”

“What’s that, my dear?” says he.

“Why,” says I, “’tis a little hard upon me, and ’tis harder upon you;I am told that Captain—” (meaning my friend’s husband) “has told you I had a great deal more than ever I pretended to have, and I am sure I never employed him so to do.”

“Well,” says he, “Captain—may have told me so, but what then, if you have not so much, that may lie at his door, but you never told me what you had, so I have no reason to blame you if you have nothing at all.”

“That is so just,” said I, “and so generous, that it makes my having but a little a double affliction to me.”

“The less you have, my dear,” says he, “the worse for us both; but I hope your affliction is not caused for fear I should be unkind to you for want of a portion; no, no, if you have nothing, tell me plainly; I may perhaps tell the Captain he has cheated me, but I can never say you have, for did not you give it under your hand that you was poor, and so I ought to expect you to be?”

“Well,” said I, “my dear, I am glad I have not been concerned in deceiving you before marriage, if I deceive you since, ’tis ne’er the worse;that I am poor, ’tis too true, but not so poor as to have nothing neither.”So I pulled out some bank bills and gave him about £160. “There is something, my dear,” says I, “and not quite all neither.”

I had brought him so near to expecting nothing, by what I had said before, that the money, though the sum was small in itself, was doubly welcome; he owned it was more than he looked for, and that he did not question by my discourse to him but that my fine clothes, gold watch, and a diamond ring or two, had been all my fortune.

I let him please himself with that £160 two or three days, and then having been abroad that day, and as if I had been to fetch it, I brought him a hundred pounds more home in gold, and told him there was a little more portion for him; and, in short, in about a week more, I brought him £180 more, and about £60 in linen, which I made believe I had been obliged to take with the £100 which I gave him in gold, as a composition for a debt of £600, being little more than five shillings in the pound, and over valued too.

“And now, my dear,” says I to him, “I am very sorry to tell you, that I have given you my whole fortune.” I added that if the person who had my £600 had not abused me, I had been worth athousand pound to him, but that as it was, I had been faithful, and reserved nothing to myself, but if it had been more he should have had it.

He was so obliged by the manner and so pleased with the sum, for he had been in a terrible fright lest it had been nothing at all, that he accepted it very thankfully: and thus I got over the fraud of passing for a fortune without money, and cheated a man into marrying me on pretence of it, which, by the way, I take to be one of the most dangerous steps a woman can take, and in which she runs the most hazards of being ill used afterwards.

My husband, to give him his due, was a man of infinite good nature, but he was no fool; and finding his income not suited to the manner of living which he had intended, if I had brought him what he expected, and being under a disappointment in his return of his plantations in Virginia, he discovered many times his inclination of going over to Virginia to live upon his own; and often would be magnifying the way of living there, how cheap, how plentiful, how pleasant, and the like.

I began presently to understand his meaning, and I took him up very plainly one morning and told him that I did so; that I found his estate turned to no account at this distance, compared to what it would do if he lived upon the spot, and that I found he had a mind to go and live there;that I was sensible he had been disappointed in a wife, and that finding his expectations not answered that way I could do no less, to make amends, than tell him that I was very willing to go to Virginia with him and live there.

He said a thousand kind things to me upon the subject of my making such a proposal to him. he told me that though he was disappointed in his expectations of a fortune, he was not disappointed in a wife, and that I was all to him that a wife could be, but that this offer was so kind that it was more than he could express.

To bring the story short, we agreed to go: he told me that he had a very good house there well furnished, that his mother lived in it and one sister, which was all the relations he had; that as soon as he came there they would remove to another house which was her own for life, and his after her decease; so that I should have all the house to myself; and I found it all exactly as he said.

We put on board the ship which we went in a large quantity of good furniture for our house, with stores of linen and other necessaries and a good cargo for sale, and away we went.

To give an account of the manner of our voyage, which was long and full of dangers, is out of my way. I kept no journal, neither did my husband; all that I can say is, that after a terrible passage, frighted twice with dreadful storms, and once with what was still more terrible, I mean a pirate, who came on board and took away almost all our provisions;and, which would have been beyond all to me, they had once taken my husband, but by entreaties were prevailed with to leave him; I say, after all these terrible things we arrived in York River in Virginia, and coming to our plantation we were received with all the tenderness and affection (by my husband’s mother) that could be expressed.

We lived here all together, my mother-in-law at my entreaty continuing in the house, for she was too kind a mother to be parted with;my husband likewise continued the same at first, and I thought myself the happiest creature alive, when an odd and surprising event put an end to all that felicity in a moment, and rendered my condition the most uncomfortable in the world.

My mother was a mighty cheerful, good-humoured old woman, I may call her so, for her son was above thirty: I say, she was very pleasant good company, and used to entertain me in particular with abundance of stories to divert me, as well of the country we were in, as of the people.

Among the rest she often told me how the greatest part of the inhabitants of that Colony came thither in very indifferent circumstances from England; that, generally speaking, they were of two sorts; either (1)such as were brought over by masters of ships to be sold as servants;or, (2)such as are transported after having been found guilty of crimes punishable with death.

“When they come here,” says she, “we make no difference, the planters buy them, and they work together in the field till their time is out; when ’tis expired,” said she, “they have encouragement given them to plant for themselves; for they have a certain number of acres of land allotted them by the country, and they go to work to clear and cure the land, and then to plant it with tobacco and corn for their own use; and as the merchants will trust them with tools and necessaries upon the credit of their crop before it is grown, so they again plant every year a little more than the year before, and so buy whatever they want with the crop that is before them. Hence, child,” says she, “many a Newgate bird becomes a great man, and we have,” continued she, “several justices of the peace, officers of the trained bands, and magistrates of the towns they live in, that have been burnt in the hand.”

She was going on with that part of the story when her own part in it interrupted her, and with a great deal of good-humoured confidence she told me she was one of the second sort of inhabitants herself; that she came away openly, having ventured too far in a particular case, so that she was become a criminal, and “Here’s the mark of it, child,” says she, and showed me a very fine white arm and hand, but branded in the inside of the hand, as in such cases it must be.

This story was very moving to me, but my mother (smiling) said,“You need not think such a thing strange, daughter, for some of the best men in the country are burnt in the hand, and they are not ashamed to own it; there’s Major—,” says she, “he was an eminent pickpocket; there’s Justice Ba—r, was a shoplifter, and both of them were burnt in the hand, and I could name you several such as they are.”

We had frequent discourses of this kind, and abundance of instances she gave me of the like; after some time, as she was telling some stories of one that was transported but a few weeks ago, I began in an intimate kind of way to ask her to tell me something of her own story, which she did with the utmost plainness and sincerity; how she had fallen into very ill company in London in her young days, occasioned by her mother sending her frequently to carry victuals to a kinswoman of hers who was a prisoner in Newgate, in a miserable starving condition, who was afterwards condemned to die, but having got respite by pleading her belly perished afterwards in the prison.

Here my mother-in-law ran out in a long account of the wicked practices in that dreadful place. “And, child,” says my mother, “perhaps you may know little of it, or it may be have heard nothing about it; but depend upon it,” says she, “we all know here, that there are more thieves and rogues made by that one prison of Newgate, than by all the clubs and societies of villains in the nation; ’tis that cursed place,” says my mother,“that half peoples this Colony.”

Here she went on with her own story so long and in so particular a manner that I began to be very uneasy, but coming to one particular that required telling her name, I thought I should have sunk down in the place, she perceived I was out of order, and asked me if I was not well, and what ailed me? I told her I was so affected with the melancholy story she had told that it had overcome me, and I begged her to talk no more of it.

“Why, my dear,” says she very kindly, “what need these things trouble you? These passages were long before your time, and they give me no trouble at all now, nay, I look back on them with a particular satisfaction, as they have been a means to bring me to this place.” Then she went on to tell me how she fell into a good family, where behaving herself well and her mistress dying, her master married her, by whom she had my husband and his sister, and that by her diligence and good management after her husband’s death she had improved the plantations to such a degree as they then were, so that most of the estate was of her getting, not of her husband’s, for she had been a widow upwards of sixteen years.

I heard this part of the story with very little attention, because I wanted much to retire and give vent to my passions; and let any one judge what must be the anguish of my mind, when I came to reflect that this was certainly no more or less than my own mother, and that I had now had two children, and was big with another, by my own brother, and lay with him still every night.

I was now the most unhappy of all women in the world. O! had the story never been told me, all had been well; it had been no crime to have lain with my husband if I had known nothing of it.

I had now such a load on my mind that it kept me perpetually waking; to reveal it I could not find would be to any purpose, and yet to conceal it would be next to impossible; nay, I did not doubt but I should talk in my sleep and tell my husband of it whether I would or no; if I discovered it, the least thing I could expect to lose was my husband, for he was too nice and too honest a man to have continued my husband after he had known I had been his sister, so that I was perplexed to the last degree.

I leave it to any man to judge what difficulties presented to my view. I was away from my native country at a distance prodigious, and the return to me impassable; I lived very well, but in a circumstance insufferable in itself; if I had discovered myself to my mother it might be difficult to convince her of the particulars, and I had no way to prove them. On the other hand, if she had questioned or doubted me I had been undone, for the bare suggestion would have immediately separated me from my husband, without gaining my mother or him, so that between the surprise on one hand and the uncertainty on the other, I had been sure to be undone.

In the meantime, as I was but too sure of the fact, I lived therefore in open avowed incest and whoredom, and all under the appearance of an honest wife; and though I was not much touched with the crime of it, yet the action had something in it shocking to nature, and made my husband even nauseous to me. However, upon the most sedate consideration, I resolved that it was absolutely necessary to conceal it all, and not make the least discovery of it either to mother or husband; and thus I lived with the greatest pressure imaginable for three years more.

During this time my mother used to be frequently telling me old stories of her former adventures, which however were no ways pleasant to me; for by it, though she did not tell it me in plain terms, yet I could understand, joined with what I heard myself of my first tutors, that in her younger days she had been whore and thief; but I verily believe she had lived to repent sincerely of both, and that she was then a very pious, sober, and religious woman.

Well, let her life have been what it would then, it was certain that my life was very uneasy to me; for I lived, as I have said, but in the worst sort of whoredom, and as I could expect no good of it, so really no good issue came of it, and all my seeming prosperity wore off and ended in misery and destruction. It was some time indeed before it came to this, for everything went wrong with us afterwards, and that which was worse, my husband grew strangely altered, froward, jealous, and unkind, and I was as impatient of bearing his carriage as the carriage was unreasonable and unjust. These things proceeded so far, and we came at last to be in such ill terms with one another, that I claimed a promise of him which he entered willingly into with me when I consented to come from England with him, viz., that if I did not like to live there I should come away to England again when I pleased, giving him a year’s warning to settle his affairs.

I say, I now claimed this promise of him, and I must confess I did it not in the most obliging terms that could be neither; but I insisted that he treated me ill, that I was remote from my friends, and could do myself no justice, and that he was jealous without cause, my conversation having been unblamable and he having no pretence for it, and that to remove to England would take away all occasion from him.

I insisted so peremptorily upon it that he could not avoid coming to a point, either to keep his word with me or to break it; and this, notwith standing he used all the skill he was master of, and employed his mother and other agents to prevail with me to alter my resolutions; indeed the bottom of the thing lay at my heart, and that made all his endeavours fruitless, for my heart was alienated from him. I loathed the thoughts of bedding with him, and used a thousand pretences of illness and humour to prevent his touching me, fearing nothing more than to be with child again, which to be sure would have prevented or at least delayed my going over to England.

However, at last I put him so out of humour that he took up a rash and fatal resolution, that in short I should not go to England; that though he had promised me, yet it was an unreasonable thing, that it would be ruinous to his affairs, would unhinge his whole family and be next to an undoing him in the world; that therefore I ought not to desire it of him, and that no wife in the world that valued her family and her husband’s prosperity, would insist upon such a thing.

This plunged me again, for when I considered the thing calmly, and took my husband as he really was, a diligent careful man in the main, and that he knew nothing of the dreadful circumstances that he was in, I could not but confess to myself that my proposal was very unreasonable and what no wife that had the good of her family at heart would have desired.

But my discontents were of another nature; I looked upon him no longer as a husband but as a near relation, the son of my own mother, and I resolved somehow or other to be clear of him, but which way I did not know.

It is said by the ill-natured world of our sex, that if we are set on a thing it is impossible to turn us from our resolutions; in short, I never ceased poring upon the means to bring to pass my voyage, and came that length with my husband at last as to propose going without him. This provoked him to the last degree, and he called me not only an unkind wife but an unnatural mother, and asked me how I could entertain such a thought without horror as that of leaving my two children (for one was dead) without a mother, and never to see them more. It was true, had things been right, I should not have done it, but now, it was my real desire never to see them or him either any more; and as to the charge of unnatural, I could easily answer it myself, while I knew that the whole relation was unnatural in the highest degree.

However, there was no bringing my husband to anything; he would neither go with me or let me go without him, and it was out of my power to stir without his consent, as any one that is acquainted with the constitution of that country knows very well.

We had many family quarrels about it, and they began to grow up to a dangerous height; for as I was quite estranged from him in affection, so I took no heed to my words, but sometimes gave him language that was provoking: in short, I strove all I could to bring him to a parting with me, which was what above all things I desired most.

He took my carriage very ill, and indeed he might well do so, for at last I refused to bed with him, and carrying on the breach upon all occasions to extremity, he told me once he thought I was mad, and if I did not alter my conduct he would put me under cure; that is to say, into a mad-house. I told him he should find I was far enough from mad, and that it was not in his power or any other villain’s to murder me. I confess at the same time I was heartily frighted at his thoughts of putting me into a mad-house, which would at once have destroyed all the possibility of bringing the truth out; for that then no one would have given credit to a word of it.

This therefore brought me to a resolution, whatever came of it, to lay open my whole case; but which way to do it, or to whom, was an inextricable difficulty; when another quarrel with my husband happened, which came up to such an extreme as almost pushed me on to tell it him all to his face; but though I kept it in so as not to come to the particulars, I spoke so much as put him into the utmost confusion, and in the end brought out the whole story.

He began with a calm expostulation upon my being so resolute to go to England; I defended it, and one hard word bringing on another, as is usual in all family strife, he told me, I did not treat him as if he was my husband, or talk of my children as if I was a mother; and in short, that I did not deserve to be used as a wife; that he had used all the fair means possible with me; that he had argued with all the kindness and calmness that a husband or a Christian ought to do, and that I made him such a vile return that I treated him rather like a dog than a man, and rather like the most contemptible stranger than a husband: that he was very loath to use violence with me, but that, in short, he saw a necessity of it now, and that for the future he should be obliged to take such measures as should reduce me to my duty.

My blood was now fired to the utmost, and nothing could appear more provoked; I told him, for his fair means and his foul, they were equally contemned by me; that for my going to England I was resolved on it, come what would; and that as to treating him not like a husband, and not showing myself a mother to my children, there might be something more in it than he understood at present; but I thought fit to tell him thus much, that he neither was my lawful husband nor they lawful children, and that I had reason to regard neither of them more than I did.

I confess I was moved to pity him when I spoke it, for he turned pale as death and stood mute as one thunder-struck, and once or twice I thought he would have fainted; in short, it put him in a fit something like an apoplex; he trembled, a sweat or dew ran off his face, and yet he was cold as a clod, so that I was forced to fetch something to keep life in him;when he recovered of that, he grew sick and vomited, and in a little after was put to bed, and the next morning was in a violent fever.

However, it went off again and he recovered, though but slowly, and when he came to be a little better he told me I had given him a mortal wound with my tongue, and he had only one thing to ask before he desired an explanation. I interrupted him, and told him I was sorry I had gone so far, since I saw what disorder it put him into, but I desired him not to talk to me of explanations, for that would but make things worse.

This heightened his impatience, and indeed perplexed him beyond all bearing; for now he began to suspect that there was some mystery yet unfolded, but could not make the least guess at it; all that ran in his brain was that I had another husband alive, but I assured him there was not the least of that in it; indeed as to my other husband, he was effectually dead to me, and had told me I should look on him as such, so I had not the least uneasiness ou that score.

But now I found the thing too far gone to conceal it much longer, and my husband himself gave me an opportunity to ease myself of the secret much to my satisfaction; he had laboured with me three or four weeks, but to no purpose, only to tell him whether I had spoken those words only to put him in a passion, or whether there was anything of truth in the bottom of them: but I continued inflexible and would explain nothing, unless he would first consent to my going to England, which he would never do, he said, while he lived; on the other hand, I said it was in my power to make him willing when I pleased,nay,to make him entreat me to go;and this increased his curiosity and made him importunate to the highest degree.

At length he tells all this story to his mother, and sets her upon me to get it out of me, and she used her utmost skill indeed; but I put her to a full stop at once, by telling her that the mystery of the whole matter lay in herself; that it was my respect to her had made me conceal it, and that, in short, I could go no farther and therefore conjured her not to insist upon it.

She was struck dumb at this suggestion, and could not tell what to say or to think; but laying aside the supposition as a policy of mine, continued her importunity on account of her son, and if possible, to make up the breach between us two; as to that, I told her that it was indeed a good design in her, but that it was impossible to be done; and that if I should reveal to her the truth of what she desired, she would grant it to be impossible and cease to desire it. At last I seemed to be prevailed on by her importunity, and told her I dare trust her with a secret of the greatest importance, and she would soon see that this was so, and that I would consent to lodge it in her breast if she would engage solemnly not to acquaint her son with it without my consent.

She was long in promising this part, but rather than not come at the main secret she agreed to that too, and after a great many other preliminaries I began and told her the whole story. First I told her how much she was concerned in all the unhappy breach which had happened between her son and me, by telling me her own story and her London name; and that the surprise she saw I was in was upon that occasion: then I told her my own story, and my name, and assured her by such other tokens as she could not deny, that I was no other nor more or less than her own child, her daughter born of her body in Newgate; the same that had saved her from the gallows by being in her belly, and that she left in such and such hands when she was transported.

It is impossible to express the astonishment she was in; she was not inclined to believe the story or to remember the particulars; for she immediately foresaw the confusion that must follow in the family upon it; but everything concurred so exactly with the stories she had told me of herself, and which if she had not told me, she would perhaps have been content to have denied, that she had stopped her own mouth, and she had nothing to do but take me about the neck and kiss me and cry most vehemently over me, without speaking one word for a long time together;at last she broke out, “Unhappy child!” says she, “what miserable chance could bring thee hither? and in the arms of my son too! Dreadful girl!” says she, “why we are all undone! Married to thy own brother! Three children, and two alive, all of the same flesh and blood! My son and my daughter lying together as husband and wife! All confusion and distraction, miserable family! What will become of us? What is to be said? What is to be done?” And thus she ran on a great while, nor had I any power to speak, or if I had, did I know what to say, for every word wounded me to the soul: with this kind of amazement we parted for the first time, though my mother was more surprised than I was, because it was more news to her than to me: however, she promised again that she would say nothing of it to her son till we had talked of it again.

It was not long, you may be sure, before we had a second conference upon the same subject; when, as if she had been willing to forget the story she had told me of herself, or to suppose that I had forgot some of the particular, she began to tell them with alterations and omissions;but I refreshed her memory in many things which I supposed she had forgot, and then came in so opportunely with the whole history that it was impossible for her to go from it; and then she fell into her rhapsodies again, and exclamations at the severity of her misfortunes: when these things were a little over with her, we fell into a close debate about what should be first done before we gave an account of the matter to my husband. But to what purpose could be all our consultations? We could neither of us see our way through it, or how it could be safe to open such a scene to him; it was impossible to make any judgment, or give any guess at what temper he would receive it in, or what measures he would take upon it; and if he should have so little government of himself as to make it public, we easily foresaw that it would be the ruin of the whole family, and if at last he should take the advantage the law would give him, he might put me away with disdain and leave me to sue for the little portion that I had, and perhaps waste it all in the suit and then be a beggar;and thus I should see him perhaps in the arms of another wife in a few months, and be myself the most miserable creature alive.

My mother was as sensible of this as I; and upon the whole we knew not what to do; after some time, we came to more sober resolutions, but then it was with this misfortune too, that my mother’s opinion and mine were quite different from one another, and indeed inconsistent with one another; for my mother’s opinion was that I should bury the whole thing entirely, and continue to live with him as my husband till some other event should make the discovery of it more convenient; and that in the meantime she would endeavour to reconcile us together again, and restore our mutual comfort and family peace; that we might lie as we used to do together and so let the whole matter remain a secret as close as death, “For, child,” says she, “we are both undone if it comes out.”

To encourage me to this she promised to make me easy in my circumstances, and to leave me what she could at her death, secured for me separately from my husband; so that if it should come out afterwards,I should be able to stand on my own feet, and procure justice too from him.

This proposal did not agree with my judgment, though it was very fair and kind in my mother, but my thoughts run quite another way.

As to keeping the thing in our own breasts and letting it all remain as it was, I told her it was impossible; and I asked her how she could think I could bear the thoughts of lying with my own brother? In the next place I told her, that her being alive was the only support of the discovery, and that while she owned me for her child, and saw reason to be satisfied that I was so, nobody else would doubt it; but that if she should die before the discovery, I should be taken for an impudent creature that had forged such a thing to go away from my husband, or should be counted crazed and distracted. Then I told her how he had threatened already to put me into a mad-house, and what concern I had been in about it, and how that was the thing that drove me to the necessity of discovering it to her as I had done.

From all which I told her that I had, on the most serious reflections I was able to make in the case, come to this resolution, which I hoped she would like, as a medium between both, viz., that she should use her endeavours with her son to give me leave to go for England as I had desired, and to furnish me with a sufficient sum of money, either in goods along with me or in bills for my support there, all along suggesting that he might one time or other think it proper to come over to me.

That when I was gone she should then in cold blood discover the case to him gradually, and as her own discretion should guide; so that he might not be surprised with it and fly out into any passions and excesses;and that she should concern herself to prevent his slighting the children, or marrying again, unless he had a certain account of my being dead.

This was my scheme, and my reasons were good; I was really alienated from him in the consequence of these things; indeed I mortally hated him as a husband, and it was impossible to remove that riveted aversion I had to him; at the same time, it being an unlawful incestuous living, added to that aversion, and everything added to make cohabiting with him the most nauseous thing to me in the world; and I think verily it was come to such a height, that I could almost as willingly have embraced a dog as have let him offer anything of that kind to me, for which reason I could not bear the thoughts of coming between the sheets with him; I cannot say that I was right in carrying it such a length while at the same time I did not resolve to discover the thing to him; but I am giving an account of what was, not of what ought or ought not to be.

In this directly opposite opinion to one another my mother and I continued a long time, and it was impossible to reconcile our judgments;many disputes we had about it, but we could never either of us yield our own, or bring over the other.

I insisted on my aversion to lying with my own brother, and she insisted upon its being impossible to bring him to consent to my going to England; and in this uncertainty we continued, not differing so as to quarrel or anything like it; but so as not to be able to resolve what we should do to make up that terrible breach.

At last I resolved on a desperate course, and told my mother my resolution, viz., that in short, I would tell him of it myself; my mother was frighted to the last degree at the very thoughts of it; but I bid her be easy, told her I would do it gradually and softly, and with all the art and good humour I was mistress of, and time it also as well as I could, taking him in good humour too. I told her I did not question but if I could be hypocrite enough to feign more affection to him than I really had, I should succeed in all my design, and we might part by consent and with a good agreement, for I might love him well enough for a brother though I could not for a husband.

All this while he lay at my mother to find out, if possible, what was the meaning of that dreadful expression of mine, as he called it, which I mentioned before; viz., that I was not his lawful wife, nor my children his legal children. My mother put him off, told him she could bring me to no explanations, but found there was something that disturbed me very much, and she hoped she should get it out of me in time, and in the meantime recommended to him earnestly to use me more tenderly, and win me with his usual good carriage; told him of his terrifying and affrighting me with his threats of sending me to a mad-house and the like, and advised him not to make a woman desperate on any account whatever.

He promised her to soften his behaviour, and bid her assure me that he loved me as well as ever, and that he had no such design as that of sending me to a mad-house, whatever he might say in his passion; also he desired my mother to use the same persuasions to me too, and we might live together as we used to do.

I found the effects of this treaty presently; my husband’s conduct was immediately altered, and he was quite another man to me; nothing could be kinder and more obliging than he was to me upon all occasions; and I could do no less than make some return to it, which I did as well as I could, but it was but in an awkward manner at best, for nothing was more frightful to me than his caresses, and the apprehensions of being with child again by him was ready to throw me into fits; and this made me see that there was an absolute necessity of breaking the case to him without any more delay, which however I did with all the caution and reserve imaginable.

He had continued his altered carriage to me near a month, and we began to live a new kind of life with one another; and could I have satisfied myself to have gone on with it I believe it might have continued as long as we had continued alive together. One evening as we were sitting and talking together under a little awning which served as an arbour at the entrance into the garden, he was in a very pleasant agreeable humour, and said abundance of kind things to me, relating to the pleasure of our present good agreement, and the disorders of our past breach, and what a satisfaction it was to him that we had room to hope we should never have any more of it.

I fetched a deep sigh, and told him there was nobody in the world could be more delighted than I was in the good agreement we had always kept up, or more afflicted with the breach of it, but I was sorry to tell him that there was an unhappy circumstance in our case which lay too close to my heart, and which I knew not how to break to him, that rendered my part of it very miserable, and took from me all the comfort of the rest.

He importuned me to tell him what it was; I told him I could not tell how to do it, that while it was concealed from him I alone was unhappy, but if he knew it also, we should be both so; and that therefore to keep him in the dark about it was the kindest thing that I could do, and it was on that account alone that I kept a secret from him, the very keeping of which I thought would first or last be my destruction.

It is impossible the express his surprise at this relation, and the double importunity which he used with me to discover it to him. He told me I could not be called kind to him, nay, I could not be faithful to him, if I concealed it from him. I told him I thought so too, and yet I could not do it. He went back to what I had said before to him, and told me he hoped it did not relate to what I said in my passion; and that he had resolved to forget all that as the effect of a rash provoked spirit. I told him I wished I could forget it all too, but that it was not to be done, the impression was too deep, and it was impossible.

He then told me he was resolved not to differ with me in anything, and that therefore he would importune me no more about it, resolving to acquiesce in whatever I did or said; only begged I would then agree, that whatever it was, it should no more interrupt our quiet and our mutual kindness.

This was the most provoking thing he could have said to me, for I really wanted his farther importunities, that I might be prevailed with to bring out that which indeed was like death to me to conceal; so I answered him plainly that I could not say I was glad not to be importuned, though I could not tell how to comply. “But come, my dear,” said I, “what conditions will you make with me upon the opening this affair to you?”

“Any conditions in the world,” said he, “that you can in reason desire of me.”

“Well,” said I, “come, give it me under your hand, that if you do not find I am in any fault, or that I am willingly concerned in the causes of the misfortunes that are to follow, you will not blame me, use me the worse, do me any injury, or make me be the sufferer for that which is not my fault.”

“That,” says he, “is the most reasonable demand in the world; not to blame you for that which is not your fault; give me a pen and ink,” says he. So I ran in and fetched pen, ink, and paper, and he wrote the condition down in the very words I had proposed it and signed it with his name.“Well,” says he, “what is next, my dear?”

“Why,” says I, “the next is that you will not blame me for not discovering the secret to you before I knew it.”

“Very just again,” says he; “with all my heart.” So he wrote down that also and signed it.

“Well, my dear,” says I, “then I have but one condition more to make with you, and that is that as there is nobody concerned in it but you and I, you shall not discover it to any person in the world except your own mother; and that in all the measures you shall take upon the discovery, as I am equally concerned in it with you, though as innocent as yourself, you shall do nothing in a passion, nothing to my prejudice, or to your mother’s prejudice, without my knowledge and consent.”

This a little amazed him, and he wrote down the words distincly, but read them over and over before he signed them, hesitating at them several times, and repeating them—“My mother’s prejudice! and your prejudice! What mysterious thing can this be?” However, at last he signed it.

“Well,” says I, “my dear, I’ll ask you no more under your hand; but as you are to hear the most unexpected and surprising thing that perhaps ever befell any family in the world, I beg of you to promise me you will receive it with composure and a presence of mind suitable to a man of sense.”

“I’ll do my utmost,” says he, “upon condition you will keep me no longer in suspense, for you terrify me with all these preliminaries.”

“Well then,” says I, “it is this, as I told you before, in a heat, that I was not your lawful wife, and that our children were not legal children, so I must let you know now in calmness and in kindness, but with affliction enough, that I am your own sister and you my own brother, and that we are both the children of our mother now alive and in the house, who is convinced of the truth of it in a manner not to be denied or contradicted.”

I saw him turn pale and look wild, and I said, “Now remember your promise, and receive it with presence of mind; for who could have said more to prepare you for it than I have done?” However, I called a servant, and got him a little glass of rum, which is the usual dram of the country, for he was fainting away.

When he was a little recovered, I said to him, “This story you may be sure requires a long explanation, and therefore have patience and compose your mind to hear it out, and I’ll make it as short as I can,” and with this I told him what I thought was needful of the fact, and particularly how my mother came to discover it to me as above. “And now, my dear,” says I,“you will see reason for my capitulations, and that I neither have been the cause of this matter, nor could be so, and that I could know nothing of it before now.”

“I am fully satisfied of that,” says he, “but ’tis a dreadful surprise to me; however, I know a remedy for it all, and a remedy that shall put an end to all your difficulties without your going to England.”

“That would be strange,” said I, “as all the rest.”

“No, no,” says he, “I’ll make it easy, there’s nobody in the way of it all but myself.” He looked a little disordered when he said this, but I did not apprehend anything from it at that time, believing, as it used to be said, that they who do those things never talk of them, or that they who talk of such things never do them.

But things were not come to their height with him, and I observed he became pensive and melancholy, and in a word, as I thought a little distempered in his head. I endeavoured to talk him into temper, and into a kind of scheme for our government in the affair, and sometimes he would be well, and talk with some courage about it; but the weight of it lay too heavy upon his thoughts, and went so far that he made two attempts upon himself, and in one of them had actually strangled himself, and had not his mother come into the room in the very moment he had died; but with the help of a negro servant she cut him down and recovered him.

Things were now come to a lamentable height: my pity for him now began to revive that affection which at first I really had for him, and I endeavoured sincerely, by all the kind carriage I could, to make up the breach; but in short, it had gotten too great a head, it preyed upon his spirits, and it threw him into a lingering consumption, though it happened not to be mortal. In this distress I did not know what to do, as his life was apparently declining, and I might perhaps have married again there very much to my advantage, had it been my business to have stayed in the country; but my mind was restless too, I hankered after coming to England, and nothing would satisfy me without it.

In short, by an unwearied importunity, my husband, who was apparently decaying, as I observed, was at last prevailed with, and so my fate pushing me on, the way was made clear for me, and my mother concurring, I obtained a very good cargo for my coming to England.

When I parted with my brother, for such I am now to call him, we agreed that after I arrived, he should pretend to have an account that I was dead in England, and so might marry again when he would; he promised, and engaged to me to correspond with me as a sister, and to assist and support me as long as I lived; and that if he died before me he would leave sufficient to his mother to take care of me still in the name of a sister, and he was in some respects just to this; but it was so oddly managed that I felt the disappointments very sensibly afterwards, as you shall hear in its time.

I came away in the month of August, after I had been eight years in that country, and now a new scene of misfortunes attended me which perhaps few women have gone through the like.

We had an indifferent good voyage till we came just upon the coast of England, and where we arrived in two and thirty days, but were then ruffled with two or three storms, one of which drove us away to the coast of Ireland, and we put in at Kinsale. We remained there about thirteen days, got some refreshment on shore, and put to sea again, though we met with very bad weather again, in which the ship sprung her main-mast, as they called it. But we got at last into Milford Haven in Wales, where though it was remote from our port, yet having my foot safe upon the firm ground of the Isle of Britain, I resolved to venture it no more upon the waters which had been so terrible to me; so getting my clothes and money on shore with my bills of loading and other papers, I resolved to come for London, and leave the ship to get to her port as she could;the port Whither she was bound was to Bristol, here my brother’s chief correspondent lived.

I got to London in about three weeks, where I heard a little while after that the ship was arrived at Bristol, but at the same time had the misfortune to know that by the violent weather she had been in and the breaking of her main-mast, she had great damage on board, and that a great part of her cargo was spoiled.

I had now a new scene of life upon my hands, and a dreadful appearance it had; I was come away with a kind of final farewell; what I brought with me was indeed considerable, had it come safe, and by the help of it I might have married again tolerably well; but as it was, I was reduced to between two or three hundred pounds in the whole, and this without any hope of recruit. I was entirely without friends, nay, even so much as without acquaintances, for I found it was absolutely necessary not to revive former acquaintance; and as for my subtle friend that set me up formerly for a fortune, she was dead and her husband also.

The looking after my cargo of goods soon after obliged me to take a journey to Bristol, and during my attendance upon that affair I took the diversion of going to the Bath, for as I was still far from being old, so my humour, which was always gay, continued so to an extreme; and being now, as it were, a woman of fortune, though I was a woman without a fortune, I expected something or other might happen in the way that might mend my circumstances, as had been my case before.

The Bath is a place of gallantry enough; expensive, and full of snares. I went thither indeed in the view of taking what might offer; but I must do myself justice as to protest I meant nothing but in an honest way, nor had any thoughts about me at first that looked the way which afterwards I suffered them to be guided.

Here I stayed the whole latter season as it is called there, and contracted some unhappy acquaintance, which rather prompted the follies I fell afterwards into than fortified me against them. I lived pleasantly enough, kept good company, that is to say, gay fine company; but had the discouragement to find this way of living sunk me exceedingly, and that as I had no settled income, so spending upon the main stock was but a certain kind of bleeding to death; and this gave me many sad reflections. However I shook them off, and still flattered myself that something or other might offer for my advantage.

But I was in the wrong place for it: I was not now at Redriff, where if I had set myself tolerably up, some honest sea captain or other might have talked with me upon the honourable terms of matrimony; but I was at the Bath, where men find a mistress sometimes but very rarely look for a wife; and consequently all the particular acquaintances a woman can expect there must have some tendency that way.

I had spent the first season well enough, for though I had contracted some acquaintance with a gentleman who came to the Bath for his diversion, yet I had entered into no felonious treaty. I had resisted some casual offers of gallantry, and had managed that way well enough; I was not wicked enough to come into the crime for the mere vice of it, and I had no extraordinary offers that tempted me with the main thing which I wanted.

However, I went this length the first season, viz., I contracted an acquaintance with a woman in whose house I lodged, who, though she did not keep an ill house, yet had none of the best principles in herself:I had on all occasions behaved myself so well as not to get the least slur upon my reputation, and all the men that I had conversed with were of so good reputation that I had not gotten the least reflection by conversing with them; nor did any of them seem to think there was room for a wicked correspondence, if they had offered it. Yet there was one gentleman, as above, who always singled me out for the diversion of my company, as he called it, which as he was pleased to say, was very agreeable to him; but at that time there was no more in it.

I had many melancholy hours at the Bath after all the company was gone, for though I went to Bristol sometimes for the disposing my effects and for recruits of money, yet I chose to come back to the Bath for my residence, because being on good terms with the woman in whose house I lodged in the summer, I found that during the winter I lived rather cheaper there than I could do anywhere else. Here, I say, I passed the winter as heavily as I had passed the autumn cheerfully; but having contracted a nearer intimacy with the said woman in whose house I lodged, I could not avoid communicating something of what lay hardest upon my mind, and particularly the narrowness of my circumstances. I told her also, that I had a mother and a brother in Virginia in good circumstances, and as I had really written back to my mother in particular, to represent my condition and the great loss I had received, so I did not fail to let my new friend know that I expected a supply from thence, and so indeed I did; and as the ships went from Bristol to York River, in Virginia, and back again generally in less time than from London, and that my brother corresponded chiefly at Bristol, I thought it was much better for me to wait here for my returns than to go to London.

My new friend appeared sensibly affected with my condition, and indeed was so very kind as to reduce the rate of my living with her to so low a price during the winter that she convinced me she got nothing by me; and as for lodging during the winter I paid nothing at all.

When the spring season came on she continued to be as kind to me as she could, and I lodged with her for a time till it was found necessary to do otherwise; she had some persons of character that frequently lodged in her house, and in particular the gentleman, who, as I said, singled me out for his companion in the winter before, and he came down again with another gentleman in his company and two servants, and lodged in the same house. I suspected that my landlady had invited him thither, letting him know that I was still with her, but she denied it.

In a word, this gentleman came down and continued to single me out for his peculiar confidence; he was a complete gentleman, that must be confessed, and his company was agreeable to me as mine, if I might believe him, was to him; he made no professions to me but of an extraordinary respect, and he had such an opinion of my virtue, that, as he often professed, he believed if he should offer anything else I should reject him with contempt. He soon understood from me that I was a widow, that I had arrived at Bristol from Virginia by the last ships; and that I waited at the Bath till the next Virginia fleet should arrive, by which I expected considerable effects. I understood by him that he had a wife, but that the lady was distempered in her head, and was under the conduct of her own relations, which he consented to avoid any reflection that might be cast upon him for mismanaging her cure; and in the meantime he came to the Bath to divert his thoughts under such a melancholy circumstance.

My landlady, who of her own accord encouraged the correspondence on all occasions, gave me an advantageous character of him as a man of honour and of virtue, as well as of a great estate; and indeed I had reason to say so of him too, for though we lodged both on a floor, and he had frequently come into my chamber even when I was in bed, and I also into his, yet he never offered anything to me farther than a kiss, or so much as solicited me to anything till long after, as you shall hear.

I frequently took notice to my landlady of his exceeding modesty, and she again used to tell me she believed it was so from the beginning;however, she used to tell me that she thought I ought to expect some gratifications from him for my company, for indeed he did as it were engross me. I told her I had not given him the least occasion to think I wanted it or that I would accept of it from him. She told me she would take that part upon her, and she managed it so dextrously that the first time we were together alone, after she had talked with him, he began to enquire a little into my circumstances, as how I had subsisted myself since I came on shore, and whether I did not want money? I stood off very boldly, I told him that though my cargo of tobacco was damaged, yet that it was not quite lost: that the merchant that I had been consigned to had so honestly managed for me that I had not wanted, and that I hoped with frugal management, I should make it hold out till more would come, which I expected by the next fleet; that in the meantime I had retrenched my expenses, and whereas I kept a maid last season, now I lived without;and whereas I had a chamber and a dining-room then on the first floor, I now had but one room, two pair of stairs, and the like. “But I live,”said I, “as well satisfied now as then;” adding, that his company had made me live much more cheerfully than otherwise I should have done, for which I was much obliged to him; and so I put off all room for any offer at the present. It was not long before he attacked me again, and told me he found that I was backward to trust him with the secret of my circumstances, which he was sorry for; assuring me that he enquired into it with no design to satisfy his own curiosity, but merely to assist me if there was any occasion; but since I would not own myself to stand in need of any assistance, he had but one thing more to desire of me, and that was that I would promise him that when I was any way straitened, I would frankly tell him of it, and that I would make use of him with the same freedom that he made the offer; adding, that I should always find I had a true friend, though perhaps I was afraid to trust him.

I omitted nothing that was fit to be said by one infinitely obliged, to let him know that I had a due sense of his kindness; and indeed from that time I did not appear so much reserved to him as I had done before, though still within the bounds of the strictest virtue on both sides; but how free soever our conversation was, I could not arrive to that freedom which he desired, viz., to tell him I wanted money, though I was secretly very glad of his offer.

Some weeks passed after this, and still I never asked him for money;when my landlady, a cunning creature, who had often pressed me to it, but found that I could not do it, makes a story of her own inventing, and comes in bluntly to me when we were together, “Of, widow,” says she, “I have bad news to tell you this morning.”

“What is that?” said I. “Is the Virginia ships taken by the French?”For that was my fear.

“No, no,” says she, “but the man you sent to Bristol yesterday for money is come back, and says he has brought none.”

I could by no means like her project; I thought it looked too much like prompting him, which he did not want, and I saw that I should lose nothing by being backward, so took her up short. “I can’t imagine why he should say so,” said I, “for I assure you he brought me all the money I sent him for, and here it is,” said I (pulling out my purse with about twelve guineas in it) and added, “I intend you shall have most of it by and by.”

He seemed distasted a little at her talking as she did, as well as I, taking it as I fancied he would, as something forward of her; but when he saw me give such an answer he came immediately to himself. The next morning we talked of it again, when I found he was fully satisfied; and smiling said he hoped I would not want money, and not tell him of it, and that I had promised him otherwise. I told him I had been very much dissatisfied at my landlady’s talking so publicly the day before of what she had nothing to do with; but I supposed she wanted what I owed her, which was about eight guineas, which I had resolved to give her, and had given it her the same night.

He was in a mighty good humour when he heard me say I had paid her, and it went off into some other discourse at that time; but the next morning he having heard me up before him, he called me and I answered;he asked me to come into his chamber; he was in bed when I came in, and he made me come and sit down on his bedside, for he said he had something to say to me. After some very kind expressions, he asked me if I would be very honest to him, and give a sincere answer to one thing he would desire of me. After some little cavil with him at the word “sincere”, and asking him if I had ever given him any answers which were not sincere, I promised him I would; why then his request was, he said, to let him see my purse; I immediately put my hand into my pocket and laughing at him, pulled it out, and there was in it three guineas and a half;then he asked me if there was all the money I had? I told him no, laughing again, not by a great deal.

Well then, he said, he would have me promise to go and fetch him all the money I had, every farthing. I told him I would, and I went into my chamber and fetched him a little private drawer, where I had about six guineas more, and some silver, and threw it all down upon the bed, and told him there was all my wealth, honestly to a shilling. He looked a little at it, but did not tell it, and huddles it all into the drawer again, and then reaching his pocket pulled out a key, and bade me open a little walnut-tree box he had upon the table, and bring him such a drawer, which I did. In this drawer, there was a great deal of money in gold. I believe near two hundred guineas, but I knew not how much: he took the drawer, and taking me by the hand, made me put it in and take a whole handful; I was backward at that, but he held my hand hard in his hand and put it into the drawer, and made me take out as many guineas as I could well take up at once.

When I had done so, he made me put them into my lap, and took my little drawer, and poured out all my own money among his, and bade me get me gone, and carry it all into my own chamber.

I relate this story the more particularly because of the good humour of it, and to show the temper with which we conversed. It was not long after this, but he began every day to find fault with my clothes, with my laces, and headdresses: and in a word, pressed me to buy better, which, by the way, I was willing enough to do, though I did not seem to be so. I loved nothing in the world better than fine clothes, but I told him I must housewife the money he had lent me, or else I should not be able to pay him again. He then told me in a few words that as he had a sincere respect for me, and knew my circumstances, he had not lent me that money but given it me, and that he thought I had merited it from him, by giving him my company so entirely as I had done. After this he made me take a maid, and keep house, and his friend being gone, he obliged me to diet him, which I did very willingly, believing, as it appeared, that I should lose nothing by it, nor did the woman of the house fail to find her account in it too.

We had lived thus nearly three months when the company beginning to wear away at the Bath, he talked of going away, and fain he would have me to go to London with him. I was not very easy in that proposal, not knowing what posture I was to live in there, or how he might use me:but while this was in debate he fell very sick; he had gone out to a place in Somersetshire, called Shepton, and was there taken very ill, and so ill that he could not travel, so he sent his man back to the Bath, to beg me that I would hire a coach and come over to him. Before he went he had left his money and other things of value with me, and what to do with them I did not know, but I secured them as well as I could, and locked up the lodgings and went to him, where I found him very ill indeed, so I persuaded him to be carried in a litter to Bath, where was more help and better advice to be had.

He consented, and I brought him to the Bath, which was about fifteen miles, as I remember: here he continued very ill of a fever and kept his bed five weeks, all which time I nursed him and tended him as carefully as if I had been his wife; indeed if I had been his wife I could not have done more; I sat up with him so much and so often that at last indeed he would not let me sit up any longer, and then I got a pallet bed into his room, and lay in it just at his bed’s feet.

I was indeed sensibly affected with his condition, and with the apprehensions of losing such a friend as he was, and was like to be to me, and I used to sit and cry by him many hours together. At last he grew better, and gave hopes that he would recover, as indeed he did, though very slowly.

Were it otherwise than what I am going to say, I should not be back-ward to disclose it, as it is apparent I have done in other cases; but I affirm through all this conversation, abating the coming into the chamber when I or he was in bed, and the necessary offices of attending him night and day when he was sick, there had not passed the least immodest word or action between us. O! that it had been so to the last.

After some time he gathered strength and grew well apace, and I would have removed my pallet bed, but he would not let me, till he was able to venture himself without anybody to sit up with him, when I removed to my own chamber.

He took many occasions to express his sense of my tenderness for him; and when he grew well he made me a present of fifty guineas for my care, and as he called it, hazarding my life to save his.

And now he made deep protestations of a sincere inviolable affection for me, but with the utmost reserve for my virtue and his own. I told him I was fully satisfied of it; he carried it that length that he protested to me that if he was naked in bed with me he would as sacredly preserve my virtue as he would defend it if I was assaulted by a ravisher. I believed him, and told him I did so; but this did not satisfy him. He would, he said, wait for some opportunity to give me an undoubted testimony of it.

It was a great while after this that I had occasion, on my business, to go to Bristol, upon which he hired me a coach, and would go with me; and now indeed our intimacy increased. From Bristol he carried me to Gloucester, which was merely a journey of pleasure to take the air;and here it was our hap to have no lodgings in the inn, but in one large chamber with two beds in it. The master of the house going With us to show his rooms, and coming into that room, said very frankly to him, “Sir, it is none of my business to enquire whether the lady be your spouse or no, but if not, you may lie as honestly in these two beds as if you were in two chambers,” and with that he pulls a great curtain which drew quite cross the room, and effectually divided the beds.

“Well,” says my friend, very readily, “these beds will do, and as for the rest, we are too near akin to lie together, though we may lodge near one another;” and this put an honest face on the thing too. When we came to go to bed, he decently went out of the room till I was in bed, and then went to bed in the other bed, but lay there talking to me a great while.

At last, repeating his usual saying that he could lie naked in the bed with me, aud not offer me the least injury, he starts out of his bed. “And now, my dear,” says he, “you shall see how just I will be to you, and that I can keep my word,” and away he comes to my bed.

I resisted a little, but I must confess I should not have resisted him much if he had not made those promises at all; so after a little struggle I lay still and let him come to bed; when he was there he took me in his arms, and so I lay all night with him, but he had no more to do with me or offered anything to me other than embracing me, as I say, in his arms, no not the whole night, but rose up and dressed him in the morning, and left me as innocent for him as I was the day I was born.

This was a surprising thing to me, and perhaps may be so to others who know how the laws of nature work; for he was a vigorous brisk person; nor did he act thus on a principle of religion at all, but of mere affection; insisting on it that though I was to him the most agreeable woman in the world, yet because he loved me he could not injure me.

I own it was a noble principle, but as it was what I never saw before, so it was perfectly amazing. We travelled the rest of the journey as we did before, and came back to the Bath, where, as he had opportunity to come to me when he would, he often repeated the same moderation, and I frequently lay with him, and although all the familiarities of man and wife were common to us, yet he never once offered to go any farther, and he valued himself much upon it; I do not say that I was so wholly pleased with it as he thought I was; for I own I was much wickeder than he.

We lived thus near two years, only with this exception, that he went three times to London in that time, and once he continued there four months, but to do him justice he always supplied me with money to subsist on very handsomely.

Had we continued thus I confess we had had much to boast of; but, as wise men say, it is ill venturing too near the brink of a command. So we found it; and here again I must do him the justice to own that the first breach was not on his part. It was one night that we were in bed together warm and merry, and having drunk, I think, a little more both of us than usual, though not in the least to disorder us, when after some other follies which I cannot name, and being clasped close in his arms, I told him (I repeat it with shame and horror of soul), that I could find in my heart to discharge him of his engagement for one night and no more.

He took me at my word immediately, and after that there was no resisting him; neither indeed had I any mind to resist him any more.

Thus the government of our virtue was broken, and I exchanged the place of a friend for that unmusical harsh sounding title of whore. In the morning we were both at our penitentials, I cried very heartily,he expressed himself very sorry; but that was all either of us could do at that time, and the way being thus cleared, and the bars of virtue and conscience thus removed, we had the less to struggle with.

It was but a dull kind of conversation that we had together for all the rest of that week. I looked on him with blushes, and every now and then started that melancholy objection, What if I should be with child now? What will become of me then? He encouraged me by telling me that as long as I was true to him, he would be so to me; and since it was gone such a length (which indeed he never intended), yet if I was with child, he would take care of that and me too. This hardened us both; I assured him if I was with child I would die for want of a midwife rather than name him as the father of it; and he assured me I should never want if I should be with child. These mutual assurances hardened us in the thing, and after this we repeated the crime as often as we pleased, till at length as I feared, so it came to pass, and I was indeed with child.

After I was sure it was so, and I had satisfied him of it too, we began to think of taking measures for the managing it, and I proposed trusting the secret to my landlady and asking her advice, which he agreed to. My landlady, a woman (as I found) used to such things, made light of it; she said, she knew it would come to that at last, and made us very merry about it. As I said above, we found her an experienced old lady at such work; she undertook everything, engaged to procure a midwife and a nurse, to satisfy all enquiries, and bring us off with reputation, and she did so very dexterously indeed.

When I grew near my time, she desired my gentleman to go away to London, or make as if he did so; when he was gone she acquainted the parish officers that there was a lady ready to lie in at her house, but that she knew her husband very well and gave them, as she pretended, an account of his name, which she called Sir Walter Cleave; telling them he was a worthy gentleman, and that he would answer for all enquiries and the like. This satisfied the parish officers presently, and I lay in in as much credit as I could have done if I had really been my Lady Cleave;and was assisted in my travail by three or four of the best citizens’ wives of Bath, which however made me a little the more expensive to him. I often expressed my concern to him about that part, but he bid me not be concerned at it.

As he had furnished me very sufficiently with money for the extraordinary expenses of my lying in, I had everything very handsome about me; but did not affect to be so gay or extravagant neither; besides, knowing the world as I had done, and that such kind things do not often last long, I took care to lay up as much money as I could for a wet day, as I called it; making him believe it was all spent upon the extraordinary appearance of things in my lying in.

By this means, with what he had given me as above, I had at the end of my lying in two hundred guineas by me, including also what was left of my own.

I was brought to bed of a fine boy indeed, and a charming child it was; and when he heard of it he wrote me a very kind obliging letter about it, and then told me he thought it would look better for me to come away for London as soon as I was up and well, that he had provided apartments for me at Hammersmith, as if I came only from London, and that after a while I should go back to the Bath, and he would go with me.

I liked his offer very well, and hired a coach on purpose, and taking my child, and a wet-nurse to tend and suckle it, and maid-servant with me, away I went for London.

He met me at Reading in his own chariot, and taking me into that left the servant and the child in the hired coach, and so he brought me to my new lodgings at Hammersmith; with which I had abundance of reason to be very well pleased, for they were very handsome rooms.

And now I was indeed in the height of what I might call prosperity, and I wanted nothing but to be a wife, which however could not be in this case, and therefore on all occasions I studied to save what I could, as I said above, against the time of scarcity; knowing well enough that such things as these do not always continue, that men that keep mistresses often change them, grow weary of them, or jealous of them, or something or other; and sometimes the ladies that are thus well used, are not careful by a prudent conduct to preserve the esteem of their persons, or the nice article of their fidelity, and then they are justly cast off with contempt.

But I was secured in this point, for as I had no inclination to change, so I had no manner of acquaintance, so no temptation to look any farther. I kept no company but in the family where I lodged, and with a clergyman’s lady at next door; so that when he was absent I visited nobody, nor did he ever find me out of my chamber or parlour whenever he came down; if I went anywhere to take the air it was always with him.

The living in this manner with him, and his with me, was certainly the most undesigned thing in the world; he often protested to me that when he became first acquainted with me, and even to the very night when we first broke in upon our rules, he never had the least design of lying with me; that he had always had a sincere affection for me, but not the least real inclination to do what he had done. I assured him I never suspected him, that if I had I should not so easily have yielded to the freedoms which brought it on, but that it was all a surprise, and was owing to our having yielded too far to our mutual inclinations that night; and indeed I have often observed since, and leave it as a caution to the readers of this story, that we ought to be cautious of gratifying our inclinations in loose and lewd freedoms, lest we find our resolutions of virtue fail us in the juncture when their assistance should be most necessary.

It is true that from the first hour I began to converse with him, I resolved to let him lie with me, if he offered it; but it was because I wanted his help, and knew of no other way of securing him: but when we were that night together and, as I have said, had gone such a length, I found my weakness: the inclination was not to be resisted, but I was obliged to yield up all even before he asked it.

However, he was so just to me that he never upbraided me with that; nor did he ever express the least dislike of my conduct on any other occasion, but always protested he was as much delighted with my company as he was the first hour we came together.

It is true that he had no wife, that is to say, she was no wife to him, but the reflections of conscience oftentimes snatch a man, especially a man of sense, from the arms of a mistress, as it did him at last, though on another occasion.

On the other hand, though I was not without secret reproaches of my own conscience for the life I led, and that even in the greatest height of the satisfaction I ever took, yet I had the terrible prospect of poverty and starving, which lay on me as a frightful spectre so that there was no looking behind me. But as poverty brought me into it, so fear of poverty kept me in it, and I frequently resolved to leave it quite off if I could but come to lay up money enough to maintain me; but these were thoughts of no weight, and whenever he came to me they vanished; for his company was so delightful that there was no being melancholy when he was there, the reflections were all the subject of those hours when I was alone.

I lived six years in this happy, but unhappy condition, in which time I brought him three children, but only the first of them lived; and though I removed twice in that six years, yet I came back the sixth year to my first lodgings at Hammersmith. Here it was that I was one morning surprised with a kind but melancholy letter from my gentleman, intimating that he was very ill, and was afraid he should have another fit of sickness, but that his wife’s relations being in the house with him, it would not be practicable to have me with him, which however he expressed his great dissatisfaction in, and that he wished I could be allowed to tend and nurse him as I did before.

I was very much concerned at this account, and was very impatient to know how it was with him. I waited a fortnight or thereabouts and heard nothing, which surprised me, and I began to be very uneasy indeed;I think I may say that for the next fortnight I was near to distracted. It was my particular difficulty, that I did not know directly where he was; for I understood at first he was in the lodgings of his wife’s mother; but having removed myself to London, I soon found, by the help of the direction I had for writing my letters to him, how to enquire after him, and there I found that he was at a house in Bloomsbury, whither he had removed his whole family; and that his wife and wife’s mother were in the same house, though the wife was not suffered to know that she was in the same house with her husband.

Here I also soon understood that he was at the last extremity, which made me almost at the last extremity too, to have a true account. One night I had the curiosity to disguise myself like a servant maid in a round cap and straw hat, and went to the door as sent by a lady of his neighbourhood where he lived before, and giving master and mistress’s service, I said I was sent to know how Mr. — did, and how he had rested that night. In delivering this message I got the opportunity I desired, for speaking with one of the maids, I held a long gossip’s tale with her, and had all the particulars of his illness, which I found was a pleurisy, attended with a cough and fever; she told me also who was in the house and how his wife was, who, by her relation, they were in some hopes might recover her understanding; but as to the gentleman himself, the doctors said there was very little hopes of him, that in the morning they thought he had been dying, and that he was but little better then, for they did not expect that he could live over the next night.

This was heavy news for me, and I began now to see an end of my prosperity, and to see that it was well I had played the good housewife and saved something while he was alive, for now I had no view of my own living before me.

It lay very heavy upon my mind too that I had a son, a fine lovely boy, above five years old, and no provision made for it, at least that I knew of; with these considerations and a sad heart, I went home that evening, and began to cast with myself how I should live, and in what manner to bestow myself for the residue of my life.

You may be sure I could not rest without enquiring again very quickly what was become of him; and not venturing to go myself I sent several sham messengers, till after a fortnight’s waiting longer, I found that there was hopes of his life, though he was still very ill; then I abated my sending to the house, and in some time after I learnt in the neighbour-hood that he was about house, and then that he was abroad again.

I made no doubt then but that I should soon hear of him, and began to comfort myself with my circumstances being, as I thought, recovered; I waited a week, and two weeks, and with much surprise near two months, and heard nothing but that being recovered he was gone into the country for the air after this distemper; after this it was yet two months more, and then I understood he was come to his city house again, but still I heard nothing from him.

I had written several letters for him, and directed them as usual, and found two or three of them had been called for, but not the rest. I wrote again in a more pressing manner than ever, and in one of them let him know that I must be forced to wait on him myself, representing my circumstances, the rent of lodgings to pay, and the provision for the child wanting, and my own deplorable condition, destitute of subsistence after his most solemn engagement to take care of and provide for me. I took a copy of this letter, and finding it lay at the house near a month and was not called for, I found means to have the copy of it put into his hands at a coffee house, where I found he used to go.

This letter forced an answer from him, by which, though I found I was to be abandoned, yet I found he had sent a letter to me some time before, desiring me to go down to the Bath again; its contents I shall come to presently.

It is true that sick beds are the times when such correspondences as this are looked on with different countenances, and seen with other eyes than we saw them with before. My lover had been at the gates of death, and at the very brink of eternity; and it seems struck with a due remorse and with sad reflections upon his past life of gallantry and levity; and among the rest, his criminal correspondence with me, which was indeed neither more or less than a long-continued life of adultery, had represented itself as it really was, not as it had been formerly thought by him to be, and he looked upon it now with a just abhorrence.

I cannot but observe also, and leave it for the direction of my sex in such cases of pleasure, that whenever sincere repentance succeeds such a crime as this, there never fails to attend a hatred of the object; and the more the affection might seem to be before, the hatred will be more in proportion. It will always be so, indeed it cannot be otherwise; for there cannot be a true and sincere abhorrence of the offence, and the love to the cause of it remain; there will with an abhorrence of the sin be found a detestation of the fellow sinner; you can expect no other.

I found it so here, though good manners and justice in this gentleman, kept him from carrying it on to any extreme; but the short history of his part in this affair was thus; he perceived by my last letter and by the rest, which he went for after, that I was not gone to the Bath, and that his first letter had not come to my hand, upon which he writes me this following:





Madam—I am surprised that my letter dated the 8th of last month, did not come to your hand; I give you my word it was delivered at your lodgings, and to the hands of your maid.

I need not acquaint you with what has been my condition for some time past; and how having been at the edge of the grave, I am by the unexpected and undeserved mercy of heaven restored again. In the condition I have been in, it cannot be strange to you that our unhappy correspondence has not been the least of the burdens which lay upon my conscience. I need say no more, those things that must be repented of must be also reformed.

I wish you would think of going back to the Bath. I enclose you here a bill for £50 for clearing yourself at your lodgings, and carrying you down, and hope it will be no surprise to you to add that on this account only, and not for any offence given me on your side, I can see you no more. I will take due care of the child; leave him where he is, or take him with you, as you please. I wish you the like reflections, and that they may be to your advantage. I am, etc.





I was struck with this letter as with a thousand wounds, the reproaches of my own conscience were such as I cannot express, for I was not blind to my own crime; and I reflected that I might with less offence have continued with my brother, since there was no crime in our marriage on that score, neither of us knowing it.

But I never once reflected that I was all this while a married woman, a wife to Mr. —, the linen draper, who though he had left me by the necessity of his circumstances, had no power to discharge me from the marriage contract which was between us or to give me a legal liberty to marry again; so that I had been no less than a whore and an adulteress all this while. I then reproached myself with the liberties I had taken, and how I had been a snare to this gentleman, and that indeed I was principal in the crime; that now he was mercifully snatched out of the gulf by a convincing work upon his mind, but that I was left as if I was abandoned by heaven to a continuing in my wickedness.

Under these reflections I continued very pensive and sad for near a month, and did not go down to the Bath, having no inclination to be with the woman who I was with before lest, as I thought, she should prompt me to some wicked course of life again, as she had done: and besides, I was loath she should know I was cast off as above.

And now I was greatly perplexed about my little boy; it was death to me to part with the child, and yet when I considered the danger of being one time or other left with him to keep without being able to support him, I then resolved to leave him; but then I concluded to be near him myself too, that I might have the satisfaction of seeing him, without the care of providing for him. So I sent my gentleman a short letter that I had obeyed his orders in all things but that of going back to the Bath, that, however, parting from him was a wound to me that I could never recover, yet that I was fully satisfied his reflections were just, and would be very far from desiring to obstruct his reformation.

Then I represented my own circumstances to him in the most moving terms. I told him that those unhappy distresses which first moved him to a generous friendship for me, would, I hope, move him to a little concern for me now; though the criminal part of our correspondence, which I believed neither of us intended to fall into at that time, was broken off;that I desired to repent as sincerely as he had done, but entreated him to put me in some condition that I might not be exposed to temptations from the frightful prospect of poverty and distress; and if he had the least apprehensions of my being troublesome to him, I begged he would put me in a posture to go back to my mother in Virgiuia, from whence he knew I came, and that would put an end to all his fears on that account;I concluded that if he would send me £50 more to facilitate my going away I would send him back a general release, and would promise never to disturb him more with any importunities; unless it were to hear of the well-doing of the child, who if I found my mother living and my circumstances able, I would send for and take him also off of his hands.

This was indeed all a cheat thus far, viz., that I had no intention to go to Virginia, as the account of my former affairs there may convince anybody of; but the business was to get this last fifty pounds of him if possible, knowing well enough it would be the last penny I was ever to expect.

However, the argument I used, viz., of giving him a general release, and never troubling him any more, prevailed effectually, and he sent me a bill for the money by a person who brought with him a general release for me to sign, and which I frankly signed; and thus, though full sore against my will, a final end was put to this affair.

And here I cannot but reflect upon the unhappy consequence of too great freedoms between persons stated as we were, upon the pretence of innocent intentions, love of friendship, and the like; for the flesh has generally so great a share in those friendships that it is great odds but inclination prevails at last over the most solemn resolutions; and that vice breaks in at the breaches of decency, which really innocent friendship ought to preserve with the greatest strictness; but I leave the readers of these things to their own just reflections, which they will be more able to make effectual than I who so soon forgot myself, and am therefore but a very indifferent monitor.

I was now a single person again, as I may call myself; I was loosed from all the obligations either of wedlock or mistress-ship in the world, except my husband the linen draper, who I having not now heard from in almost fifteen years, nobody could blame me for thinking myself entirely freed from; seeing also he had at his going away told me that if I did not hear frequently from him I should conclude he was dead, and I might freely marry again to whom I pleased.

I now began to cast up my accounts; I had by many letters and much importunity, and with the intercession of my mother too, had a second return of some goods from my brother, as I now call him, in Virginia, to make up the damage of the cargo I brought away with me, and this too was upon the condition of my sealing a general release to him, which though I thought hard, but yet I was obliged to promise. I managed so well in this case that I got my goods away before the release was signed, and then I always found something or other to say to evade the thing and to put off the signing it at all; till at length I pretended I must write to my brother before I could do it.

Including this recruit, and before I got the last £50, I found my strength to amount, put all together, to about £400, so that with that I had above £450. I had saved £100 more, but I met with a disaster with that, which was this; that a goldsmith in whose hands I had trusted it, broke, so I lost £70 of my money, the man’s composition not making above £30 out of his £100, I had a little plate, but not much, and was well enough stocked with clothes and linen.

With this stock I had the world to begin again; but you are to consider that I was not now the same woman as when I lived at Rotherhithe; for first of all I was near twenty years older, and did not look the better for my age, nor for my rambles to Virginia and back again; and though I omitted nothing that might set me out to advantage, except painting, for that I never stooped to, yet there would always be some difference seen between five-and-twenty and two-and-forty.

I cast about innumerable ways for my future state of life, and began to consider very seriously what I should do, but nothing offered; I took care to make the world take me for something more than I was, and had it given out that I was a fortune, and that my estate was in my own hands, the last of which was very true, the first of it was as above: I had no acquaintance, which was one of my worst misfortunes, and the consequence of that was I had no adviser, and above all, I had nobody to whom I could in confidence commit the secret of my circumstances to;and I found by experience that to be friendless is the worst condition, next to being in want, that a woman can be reduced to: I say a woman because ’tis evident men can be their own advisers and their own directors, and know how to work themselves out of difficulties and into business better than women; but if a woman has no friend to communicate her affairs to, and to advise and assist her ’tis ten to one but she is undone; nay, and the more money she has the more danger she is in of being wronged and deceived; and this was my case in the affair of the hundred pounds which I left in the hand of the goldsmith, as above, whose credit, it seems, was upon the ebb before, but I that had nobody to consult with knew nothing of it, and so lost my money.

When a woman is thus left desolate and void of counsel she is just like a bag of money, or a jewel dropped on the highway, which is a prey to the next comer; if a man of virtue and upright principles happens to find it he will have it cried, and the owner may come to hear of it again; but how many times shall such a thing fall into hands that will make no scruple of seizing it for their own to once that it shall come into good hands?

This was evidently my case, for I was now a loose unguided creature and had no help, no assistance, no guide for my conduct. I knew what I aimed at and what I wanted, but knew nothing how to pursue the end by direct means; I wanted to be placed in a settled state of living, and had I happened to meet with a sober good husband, I should have been as true a wife to him as virtue itself could have formed: if I had been otherwise, the vice came in always at the door of necessity, not at the door of inclination;and I understood too well by the want of it, what the value of a settled life was, to do anything to forfeit the felicity of it; nay, I should have made the better wife for all the difficulties I had passed through by a great deal; nor did I in any of the times that I had been a wife give my husbands the least uneasiness on account of my behaviour.

But all this was nothing; I found no encouraging prospect; I waited, I lived regularly, and with as much frugality as became my circumstances, but nothing offered; nothing presented, and the main stock wasted apace, what to do I knew not, the terror of approaching poverty lay hard upon my spirits: I had some money, but where to place it I knew not, nor would the interest of it maintain me, at least not in London.

At length a new scene opened: there was in the house where I lodged, a North Country gentlewoman, and nothing was more frequent in her discourse than her account of the cheapness of provisions and the easy way of living in her country; how plentiful and how cheap everything was, what good company they kept, and the like; till at last I told her she almost tempted me to go and live in her country; for I that was a widow, though I had sufficient to live on, yet had no way of increasing it, and that London was an extravagant place; that I found I could not live here under one hundred pounds a year, unless I kept no company, no servant, made no appearance, and buried myself in privacy, as if I was obliged to it by necessity.

I should have observed that she was always made to believe, as everybody else was, that I was a great fortune, or at least that I had three or four thousand pounds if not more, and all in my own hands; and she was mighty sweet upon me when she thought me inclined in the least to go into her country; she said she had a sister lived near Liverpool, that her brother was a considerable gentleman there, and had a great estate also in Ireland; that she would go down there in about two months, and if I would give her my company thither I should be as welcome as herself for a month or more as I pleased, till I should see how I liked the country;and if I thought fit to live there she would undertake they would take care, though they did not entertain lodgers themselves, they would recommend me to some agreeable family where I should be placed to my content.

If this woman had known my real circumstances she would never have laid so many snares, and taken so many weary steps to catch a poor desolate creature that was good for little when it was caught; and indeed I, whose case was almost desperate, and thought I could not be much worse, was not very anxious about what might befall me, provided they did me no personal injury; so I suffered myself, though not without a great deal of invitation and great professions of sincere friendship and real kindness, I say, I suffered myself to be prevailed upon to go with her, and accordingly I put myself in a posture for a journey, though I did not absolutely know whither I was to go.

And now I found myself in great distress; what little I had in the world was all in money, except as before, a little plate, some linen, and my clothes, as for household stuff I had little or none, for I had lived always in lodgings; but I had not one friend in the world with whom to trust that little I had or to direct me how to dispose of it; I thought of the bank and of the other companies in London, but I had no friend to commit the management of it to, and to keep and carry about me bank bills, tallies, orders, and such things I looked upon as unsafe; that if they were lost my money was lost, and then I was undone; and on the other hand I might be robbed and perhaps murdered in a strange place for them; and what to do I knew not.

It came into my thoughts one morning that I would go to the bank myself, where I had often been to receive the interest of some bills I had, and where I had found the clerk to whom I applied myself very honest to me, and particularly so fair one time that when I had mistold the money, and taken less than my due and was coming away, he set me to rights and gave me the rest, which he might have put into his own pocket.

I went to him and asked if he would trouble himself to be my adviser, who was a poor friendless widow and knew not what to do. He told me if I desired his opinion of anything within the reach of his business, he would do his endeavour that I should not be wronged, but that he would also help me to a good sober person of his acquaintance who was a clerk in such business too, though not in their house, whose judgment was good, and whose honesty I might depend upon; “for,” added he, “I will answer for him, and for every step he takes; if he wrongs you, madam, of one farthing, it shall lie at my door; and he delights to assist people in such cases, he does it as an act of charity.”

I was a little at a stand at this discourse, but after some pause I told him I had rather have depended upon him, because I had found him honest, but if that could not be I would take his recommendation sooner than any one’s else.

“I dare say, madam,” says he, “that you will be as well satisfied with my friend as with me, and he is thoroughly able to assist you, which I am not.” It seems he had his hands full of the business of the bank, and had engaged to meddle with no other business than that of his office. He added that his friend should take nothing of me for his advice or assistance, and this indeed encouraged me.

He appointed the same evening, after the bank was shut, for me to meet him and his friend: as soon as I saw his friend, and he began but to talk of the affair, I was fully satisfied I had a very honest man to deal with, his countenance spoke it, and his character, as I heard afterwards, was everywhere so good that I had no room for any more doubts upon me.

After the first meeting, in which I only said what I had said before, he appointed me to come the next day, telling me, I might in the meantime satisfy myself of him by enquiry, which however I knew not how to do, having no acquaintance myself.

Accordingly I met him the next day, when I entered more freely with him into my case; I told him my circumstances at large, that I was a widow come over from America, perfectly desolate and friendless; that I had a little money, and but a little, and was almost distracted for fear of losing it, having no friend in the world to trust with the management of it; that I was going into the North of England to live cheap that my stock might not waste; that I would willingly lodge my money in the bank, but that I durst not carry the bills about me; and how to correspond about it or with who I knew not.

He told me I might lodge the money in the bank as an account, and its being entered in the books would entitle me to the money at any time, and if I was in the North I might draw bills on the cashier, and receive it when I would; but that then it would be esteemed as running cash, and the bank would give no interest for it; that I might buy stock with it, and so it would lie in store for me, but that then if I wanted to dispose of it I must come up to Town to transfer it, and even it would be with some difficulty I should receive the half-yearly dividend, unless I was here in person or had some friend I could trust with having the stock in his name to do it for me, and that would have the same difficulty in it as before; and with that he looked hard at me and smiled a little; at last, says he, “Why do you not get a head steward, madam, that may take you and your money together, and then you would have the trouble taken off of your hands?”

“Ay, sir, and the money too it may be,” said I, “for truly I find the hazard that way is as much as ’tis t’other way;” but I remember, I said, secretly to myself, I wish you would ask me the question fairly, I would consider very seriously on it before I said “No.”

He went on a good way with me, and I thought once or twice he was in earnest, but, to my real affliction, I found at last he had a wife;but when he owned he had a wife he shook his head, and said with some concern that indeed he had a wife and no wife. I began to think he had been in the condition of my late lover, and that his wife had been lunatic or some such thing. However, we had not much more discourse at that time but he told me he was in too much hurry of business then, but that if I would come home to his house after their business was over he would consider what might be done for me to put my affairs in a posture of security. I told him I would come, and desired to know where he lived. He gave me a direction in writing, and when he gave it me he read it to me, and said, “There ’tis, madam, if you dare trust yourself with me.”

“Yes, sir,” said I, “I believe I may venture to trust you with myself, for you have a wife, you say, and I don’t want a husband; besides, I dare trust you with my money which is all I have in the world, and if that were gone I may trust myself anywhere.”

He said some things in jest that were very handsome and mannerly, and would have pleased me very well if they had been in earnest; but that passed over, I took the directions, and appointed to be at his house at seven o’clock the same evening.

When I came he made several proposals for my placing my money in the bank in order to my having interest for it; but still some difficulty or other came in the way, which he objected as not safe; and I found such a sincere disinterested honesty in him that I began to think I had certainly found the honest man I wanted; and that I could never put myself into better hands; so I told him with a great deal of frankness that I had never met with a man or woman yet that I could trust, or in whom I could think myself safe, but that I saw he was so disinterestedly concerned for my safety that I would freely trust him with the management of that little I had, if he would accept to be steward for a poor widow that could give him no salary.

He smiled and standing up, with great respect saluted me; he told me he could not but take it very kindly that I had so good an opinion of him;that he would not deceive me, that he would do anything in his power to serve me and expect no salary; but that he could not by any means accept of a trust that might bring to be suspected of self-interest, and that if I should die he might have disputes with my executors which he should be very loath to encumber himself with.

I told him if those were all his objections I would soon remove them and convince him that there was not the least room for any difficulty; for that, first as for suspecting him, if ever now was the time to suspect him, and not to put the trust into his hands, and whenever I did suspect him, he could but throw it up then and refuse to go on; then, as to executors, I assured him I had no heirs nor any relations in England, and I would have neither heirs or executors but himself, unless I should alter my condition, and then his trust and trouble should cease together, which however I had no prospect of yet; but I told him if I died as I was, it should be all his own, and he would deserve it by being so faithful to me as I was satisfied he would be.

He changed his countenance at this discourse, and asked me how I came to have so much good-will for him? and looking very much pleased, said he might very lawfully wish he was single for my sake; I smiled and told him, that as he was not, my offer could have no design upon him, and to wish was not to be allowed, ’twas criminal to his wife.

He told me I was wrong. “For,” says he, “as I said before, I have a wife and no wife, and ’twould be no sin to wish her hanged.”

“I know nothing of your circumstances that way, sir,” said I; “but it cannot be innocent to wish your wife dead.”

“I tell you,” says he again, “she is a wife and no wife; you don’t know what I am, or what she is.”

“That’s true,” said I, “sir, I don’t know what you are, but I believe you to be an honest man, and that’s the cause of all my confidence in you.”

“Well, well,” says he, “and so I am, but I am something else too, madam; for,” says he, “to be plain with you, I am a cuckold, and she is a whore;” he spoke it in a kind of jest, but it was with such an awkward smile, that I perceived it stuck very close to him, and he looked dismally when he said it.

“That alters the case indeed, sir,” said I, “as to that part you were speaking of; but a cuckold you know may be an honest man, it does not alter that case at all; besides I think,” said I, “since your wife is so dishonest to you, you are too honest to her, to own her for your wife; but that,” said I, “is what I have nothing to do with.”

“Nay,” says he, “I do think to clear my hands of her, for to be plain with you, madam,” added he, “I am no contented cuckold neither: on the other hand, I assure you it provokes me to the highest degree, but I can’t help myself; she that will be a whore, will be a whore.”

I waved the discourse and began to talk of my business, but I found he could not have done with it, so I let him alone and he went on to tell me all the circumstances of his case, too long to relate here; particularly, that having been out of England some time before he came to the post he was in, she had had two children in the meantime by an officer of the army; and that when he came to England and, upon her submission, took her again and maintained her very well, yet she ran away from him with a linen draper’s apprentice, robbed him of what she could come at, and continued to live from him still. “so that, madam,” says he, “she is a whore not by necessity, which is the common bait, but by inclination and for the sake of the vice.”

Well, I pitied him, and wished him well rid of her, and still would have talked of my business, but it would not do; at last he looked steadily at me, “Look you, madam,” says he, “you came to ask advice of me, and I will serve you faithfully as if you were my own sister; but I must turn the tables, since you oblige me to do it and are so friendly to me, and I think I must ask advice of you; tell me what must a poor abused fellow do with a whore? What can I do to do myself justice upon her?”

“Alas, sir,” says I, “’tis a case too nice for me to advise in, but it seems she has run away from you, so you are rid of her fairly; what can you desire more?”

“Ay, she is gone indeed,” said he, “but I am not clear of her for all that.”

“That’s true,” says I, “she may indeed run you into debt, but the law has furnished you with methods to prevent that also, you may cry her down, as they call it.”

“No, no,” says he, “that is not the case, I have taken care of all that;’tis not that part that I speak of, but I would be rid of her that I might marry again.”

“Well, sir,” says I, “then you must divorce her; if you can prove what you say you may certainly get that done and then you are free.”

“That’s very tedious and expensive,” says he.

“Why,” says I, “if you can get any woman you like to take your word, I suppose your wife would not dispute the liberty with you that she takes herself.”

“Ay,” says he, “but ’twould be hard to bring an honest woman to do that; and for the other sort,” says he, “I have had enough of her to meddle with any more whores.”

It occurred to me presently, I would have taken your word with all my heart if you had but asked me the question, but that was to myself;to him I replied, “Why, you shut the door against any honest woman accepting you, for you condemn all that should venture upon you, and conclude that a woman that takes you now can’t be honest.”

“Why,” says he, “I wish you would satisfy me that an honest woman would take me; I’d venture it,” and then turns short upon me, “Will you take me, madam?”

“That’s not a fair question,” says I, “after what you have said;however, lest you should think I wait only a recantation of it, I shall answer you plainly, ‘No, not I’; my business is of another kind with you;and I did not expect you would have turned my serious application to you in my distracted case, into a comedy.”

“Why, madam,” says he, “my case is as distracted as yours can be, and I stand in as much need of advice as you do, for I think if I have not relief somewhere I shall be mad myself, and I know not what course to take, I protest to you.”

“Why, sir,” says I, “’tis easier to give advice in your case than mine.”

“Speak, then,” says he, “I beg of you, for now you encourage me.”

“Why,” says I, “if your case is so plain, you may be legally divorced, and then you may find honest women enough to ask the question of fairly, the sex is not so scarce that you can want a wife.”

“Well, then,” said he, “I am in earnest, I’ll take your advice; but shall I ask you one question seriously beforehand?”

“Any question,” said I, “but that you did before.”

“No, that answer will not do,” said he, “for, in short, that is the question I shall ask.”

“You may ask what questions you please, but you have my answer to that already,” said I. “Besides, sir,” said I, “can you think so ill of me as that I would give any answer to such a question beforehand? Can any woman alive believe you in earnest or think you design anything but to banter her?”

“Well, well,” says he, “I do not banter you, I am in earnest, consider of it.”

“But, sir,” says I, a little gravely, “I came to you about my own business, I beg of you to let me know what you will advise me to do?”

“I will be prepared,” says he, “against you come again.”

“Nay,” says I, “you have forbid my coming any more.”

“Why so?” said he, and looked a little surprised.

“Because,” said I, “you can’t expect I should visit you on the account you talk of.”

“Well,” says he, “you shall promise to come again, however, and I will not say any more of it till I have the divorce, but I desire you’ll prepare to be better conditioned when that’s done, for you shall be the woman or I will not be divorced at all: I owe it to your unlooked for kindness if to nothing else, but I have other reasons too.”

He could not have said anything in the world that pleased me better;however, I knew that the way to secure him was to stand off while the thing was so remote, as it appeared to be, and that it was time enough to accept of it when he was able to perform it; so I said very respectfully to him it was time enough to consider these things when he was in a condition to talk of them; in the meantime I told him, I was going a great way from him, and he would find objects enough to please him better. We broke off here for the present, and he made me promise him to come again the next day for my own business, which after some pressing I did;though, had he seen farther into me, I wanted no pressing on that account.

I came the next evening accordingly, and brought my maid with me to let him see that I kept a maid. He would have had me let the maid have stayed, but I would not, but ordered her aloud to come for me again about nine o’clock, but he forbid that and told me he would see me safe home, which I was not very well pleased with, supposing he might do that to know where I lived and enquire into my character and circumstances. However, I ventured that, for all the people there knew of me was to my advantage; and all the character he had of me, was, that I was a woman of fortune, and that I was a very modest sober body; which whether true or not in the main, yet you may see how necessary it is for all women who expect anything in the world to preserve the character of their virtue, even when perhaps they may have sacrificed the thing itself.

I found, and was not a little pleased with it, that he had provided a supper for me: I found also he lived very handsomely, and had a house very handsomely furnished, and which I was rejoiced at indeed, for I looked upon it all as my own.

We had now a second conference upon the subject matter of the last. He laid his business very home indeed; he protested his affection to me, and indeed I had no room to doubt it; he declared that it began from the first moment I talked with him, and long before I had mentioned leaving my effects with him; ’tis no matter when it began, thought I, if it will but hold, ’twill be well enough. He then told me how much the offer I had made of trusting him with my effects had engaged him; so I intended it should, thought I, but then I thought you had been a single man too. After we had supped I observed he pressed me very hard to drink two or three glasses of wine, which however I declined, but drank one glass or two. He then told me he had a proposal to make to me which I should promise him I would not take ill if I should not grant it. I told him I hoped he would make no dishonourable proposal to me, especially in his own house, and that if it was such I desired he would not mention it, that I might not be obliged to offer any resentment to him that did not become the respect I professed for him, and the trust I had placed in him, in coming to his house; and begged of him he would give me leave to go away, and accordingly began to put on my gloves and prepare to be gone, though at the same time I no more intended it than he intended to let me.

Well, he importuned me not to talk of going; he assured me, he was very far from offering any such thing to me that was dishonourable, and if I thought so he would choose to say no more of it.

That part I did not relish at all; I told him I was ready to hear anything that he had to say, depending that he would say nothing unworthy of himself or unfit for me to hear; upon this he told me his proposal was this: that I would marry him, though he had not yet obtained the divorce from the whore his wife; and to satisfy me that he meant honourably, he would promise not to desire me to live with him, or go to bed to him till the divorce was obtained. My heart said yes to this offer at first word, but it was necessary to play the hypocrite a little more with him; so I seemed to decline the motion with some warmth as unfair, told him that such a proposal could be of no signification but to entangle us both in great difficulties; for if he should not at last obtain the divorce, yet we could not dissolve the marriage, neither could we proceed in it; so that if he was disappointed in the divorce, I left him to consider what a condition we should both be in.

In short, I carried on the argument against this so far that I convinced him it was not a proposal that had any sense in it, unless he went from it to another, viz., that I would sign and seal a contract with him, conditioning to marry him as soon as the divorce was obtained, and to be void if he could not get it.

I told him that was more rational than the other; but as this was the first time that ever I could imagine him weak enough to be in earnest, I did not use to say yes at first asking, I would consider of it. I played with this lover as an angler does with a trout; I found I had him fast on the hook, so I jested with his new proposal and put him off; I told him he knew little of me, and bade him enquire about me; I let him also go home with me to my lodging, though I would not ask him to go in, for I told him it was not decent.

In short, I ventured to avoid signing a contract, and the reason why I did was because the lady that had invited me to go with her into Lancashire insisted so positively upon it, and promised me such great fortunes and fine things there, that I was tempted to go and try; perhaps, said I, I may mend myself very much, and then I made no scruple of quitting my honest citizen, whom I was not so much in love with as not to leave him for a richer.

In a word, I avoided a contract; but told him I would go into the North, that he would know where to write to me by the business I had entrusted with him, that I would give him a sufficient pledge of my respect for him, for I would leave almost all I had in the world in his hands; and I would thus far give him my word, that as soon as he had sued out the divorce, if he would send me an account of it, I would come up to London and that then we would talk seriously of the matter.

It was a base design I went with, that I must confess, though I was invited thither with a design much worse, as the sequel will discover;well, I went with my friend, as I called her, into Lancashire; all the way we went she caressed me with the utmost appearance of a sincere undissembled affection; treated me, except my coach-hire, all the way;and her brother brought a gentleman’s coach to Warrington to receive us, and we were carried from thence to Liverpool with as much ceremony as I could desire.

We were also entertained at a merchant’s house in Liver-pool three or four days very handsomely: I forbear to tell his name because of what followed; then she told me she would carry me to an uncle’s house of hers where we should be nobly entertained; and her uncle, as she called him, sent a coach and four horses for us, and we were carried near forty miles I know not whither.

We came however to a gentleman’s seat, where was a numerous family, a large park, extraordinary company indeed, and where she was called cousin; I told her if she had resolved to bring me into such company as this she should have let me have furnished myself with better clothes; the ladies took notice of that, and told me very genteelly they did not value people in their own country so much by their clothes as they did in London; that their cousin had fully informed them of my quality, and that I did not want clothes to set me off; in short, they entertained me not like what I was but like what they thought I had been, viz., a widow lady of a great fortune.

The first discovery I made here was that the family were all Roman Catholics, and the cousin too; however, nobody in the world could behave better to me; and I had all the civility shown that I could have had if I had been of their opinion. The truth is I had not so much principle of any kind, as to be nice in point of religion; and I presently learned to speak favourably of the Romish Church; particularly I told them I saw little but the prejudice of education in all the differences that were among Christians about religion, and if it had so happened that my father had been a Roman Catholic, I doubted not but I should have been as well pleased with their religions as my own.

This obliged them in the highest degree, and as I was besieged day and night with good company and pleasant discourse, so I had two or three old ladies that lay at me upon the subject of religion too; I was so complaisant that I made no scruple to be present at their mass and to conform to all their gestures as they showed me the pattern, but I would not come too cheap; so that I only in the main encouraged them to expect that I would turn Roman Catholic if I was instructed in the Catholic doctrine, as they called it, and so the matter rested.

I stayed here about six weeks; and then my conductor led me back to a country village about six miles from Liverpool, where her brother (as she called him) came to visit me in his own chariot, with two footmen in a good livery; and the next thing was to make love to me. As it happened to me, one would think I could not have been cheated, and indeed I thought so myself, having a safe card at home which I resolved not to quit unless I could mend myself very much. However, in all appearances this brother was a match worth my listening to, and the least his estate was valued at was a £1,000 a year, but the sister said it was worth £1,500 a year, and lay most of it in Ireland.

I that was a great fortune and passed for such, was above being asked how much my estate was; and my false friend taking it upon a foolish hearsay had raised it from £500 to £5,000, and by the time she came into the country she called it £15,000. The Irishman, for such I understood him to be, was stark mad at this bait: in short, he courted me, made me presents, and ran in debt like a madman for the expenses of his courtship. He had, to give him his due, the appearance of an extraordinary fine gentleman; he was tall, well-shaped, and had an extraordinary address; talked as naturally of his park and his stables; or his horses, his gamekeepers, his woods, his tenants, and his servants, as if he had been in a mansion house, and I had seen them all about me.

He never so much as asked me about my fortune or estate; but assured me that when we came to Dublin he would jointure me in £600 a year in good land; and that he would enter into a deed of settlement, or contract here, for the performance of it.

This was such language indeed as I had not been used to, and I was here beaten out of all my measures; I had a she devil in my bosom, every hour telling me how great her brother lived. One time she would come for my orders, how I would have my coach painted, and how lined; and another time what clothes my page should wear. In short, my eyes were dazzled, I had now lost my power of saying “No,” and to cut the story short I consented to be married; but to be more private we were carried farther into the country and married by a priest, which I was assured would marry us as effectually as a Church of England parson.

I cannot say but I had some reflections in this affair, upon the dishonourable forsaking my faithful citizen who loved me sincerely, and who was endeavouring to quit himself of a scandalous whore by whom he had been barbarously used, and promised himself infinite happiness in his new choice; which choice was now giving up herself to another in a manner almost as scandalous as hers could be.

But the glittering show of a great estate and of fine things, which the deceived creature that was now my deceiver represented every hour to my imagination, hurried me away and gave me no time to think of London, or of anything there, much less of the obligation I had to a person of infinitely more real merit than what was now before me.

But the thing was done, I was now in the arms of my new spouse, who appeared still the same as before; great even to magnificence, and nothing less than a thousand pounds a year could support the ordinary equipage he appeared in.

After we had been married about a month he began to talk of my going to Westchester in order to embark for Ireland. However, he did not hurry me, for we stayed near three weeks longer, and then he sent to Chester for a coach to meet us at the Black Rock, as they call it, over against Liverpool: thither we went in a fine boat they call a pinnace, with six oars, his servants, and horses, and baggage going in a ferry-boat. He made his excuse to me that he had no acquaintance at Chester, but he would go before and get some handsome apartments for me at a private house. I asked him how long we should stay at Chester? He said not at all, any longer than one night or two, but he would immediately hire a coach to go to Holyhead. Then I told him he should by no means give himself the trouble to get private lodgings for one night or two, for that Chester being a great place, I made no doubt but there would be very good inns and accommodation enough; so we lodged at an inn not far from the Cathedral, I forget what sign it was at.

Here my spouse talking of my going to Ireland, asked me if I had no affairs to settle at London before we went off. I told him “No,” not of any great consequence but what might be done as well by letter from Dublin.

“Madam,” says he very respectfully, “I suppose the greatest part of your estate, which my sister tells me is most of it in money in the Bank of England, lies secure enough, but in case it required transferring or any way altering its property, it might be necessary to go up to London and settle those things before we went over.”

I seemed to look strange at it, and told him I knew not what he meant; that I had no effects in the Bank of England that I knew of; and I hope he could not say that I had ever told him I had.

“No,” he said, “I had not told him so, but his sister had said the greatest part of my estate lay there, and I only mentioned it, my dear,”said he, “that if there was any occasion to settle it, or order anything about it, we might not be obliged to the hazard and trouble of another voyage back again, for,” he added, “that he did not care to venture me too much upon the sea.”

I was surprised at this talk and began to consider what the meaning of it must be, and it presently occurred to me that my friend, who called him brother, had represented me in colours which were not my due; and I thought that I would know the bottom of it before I went out of England, and before I should put myself into I knew not whose hands in a strange country.

Upon this I called his sister into my chamber the next morning, and letting her know the discourse her brother and I had been upon I conjured her to tell me what she had said to him, and upon what foot it was that she had made this marriage? She owned that she had told him that I was a great fortune, and said that she was told so at London.

“Told so,” says I warmly, “did I ever tell you so?”

“No,” she said, “it was true I never did tell her so, but I had said several times that what I had was in my own disposal.”

“I did so,” returned I very quick, “but I never told you I had anything called a fortune; nor that I had one hundred pounds, or the value of an hundred pounds in the world; and how did it consist with my being a fortune,” said I, “that I should come here into the North of England with you, only upon the account of living cheap?” At these words which I spoke warm and high, my husband came into the room, and I desired him to come in and sit down, for I had something of moment to say before them both, which it was absolutely necessary he should hear.

He looked a little disturbed at the assurance with which I seemed to speak it, and came and sat down by me, having first shut the door; upon which I began, for I was very much provoked, and turning myself to him,“I am afraid,” says I, “my dear,” for I spoke with kindness on his side, “that you have a very great abuse put upon you, and an injury done you never to be repaired in your marrying me, which however as I have had no hand in it, I desire I may be fairly acquitted of it, and that the blame may lie where it ought and nowhere else, for I wash my hands of every part of it.”

“What injury can be done me, my dear,” says he, “in marrying you? I hope it is to my honour and advantage every way.”

“I will soon explain it to you,” says I, “and I fear there will be no reason to think yourself well used, but I will convince you, my dear,” says I again, “that I have had no hand in it.”

He looked now scared and wild, and began, I believed, to suspect what followed; however, looking towards me and saying only, “Go on,”he sat silent, as if to hear what I had more to say; so I went on.

“I asked you last night,” said I, speaking to him, “if ever I had made any boast to you of my estate, or ever told you I had any estate in the Bank of England or anywhere else, and you owned I had not, as is most true; and I desire you will tell me here, before your sister, if ever I gave you any reason from me to think so or that ever we had any discourse about it.” And he owned again I had not; but said, I had appeared always as a woman of fortune, and he depended on it that I was so, and hoped he was not deceived. “I am not enquiring whether you have been deceived,”said I, “I fear you have, and I too; but I am clearing myself from being concerned in deceiving you.”

“I have been now asking your sister if ever I told her of any fortune or estate I had, or gave her any particulars of it; and she owns I never did: and pray, madam,” said I, “be so just to me, to charge me if you can, if ever I pretended to you that I had an estate; and why if I had, should I ever come down into this country with you on purpose to spare that little I had, and live cheap?” She could not deny one word, but said she had been told in London that I had a very great fortune and that it lay in the Bank of England.

“And now, dear sir,” said I, turning myself to my new spouse again,“be so just to me as to tell me who has abused both you and me so much as to make you believe I was a fortune, and prompt you to court me to this marriage?”

He could not speak a word, but pointed to her; and after some more pause, flew out in the most furious passion that ever I saw a man in my life; cursing her, and calling her all the whores and hard names he could think of; and that she had ruined him, declaring that she had told him I had fifteen thousand pounds, and that she was to have five hundred pounds of him for procuring this match for him: he then added, directing his speech to me, that she was none of his sister, but had been his whore for two years before, that she had had one hundred pounds of him in part of this bargain, and that he was utterly undone if things were as I said;and in his raving he swore he would let her heart’s blood out immediately, which frightened her and me too. She cried, said she had been told so in the house where I lodged, but this aggravated him more than before that she should put so far upon him, and run things such a length upon no other authority than a hearsay; and then turning to me again, said very honestly, he was afraid we were both undone: “For to be plain, my dear, I have no estate,” says he, “what little I had, this devil has made me run out in putting me into this equipage.” She took the opportunity of his being earnest in talking with me, and got out of the room, and I never saw her more.

I was confounded now as much as he, and knew not what to say. I thought many ways that I had the worst of it, but his saying he was undone, and that he had no estate neither put me into a mere distraction.“Why,” says I to him, “this has been a hellish juggle, for we are married here upon the foot of a double fraud; you are undone by the disappointment it seems, and if I had had a fortune I had been cheated too, for you say you have nothing.”

“You would indeed have been cheated, my dear,” says he, “but you would not have been undone, for fifteen thousand pounds would have maintained us both very handsomely in this country; and I had resolved to have dedicated every groat of it to you; I would not have wronged you of a shilling, and the rest I would have made up in my affection to you, and tenderness of you as long as I lived.”

This was very honest indeed, and I really believe he spoke as he intended, and that he was a man that was as well qualified to make me happy, as to his temper and behaviour, as any man ever was; but his having no estate and being run into debt on this ridiculous account in the country, made all the prospect dismal and dreadful, and I knew not what to say or what to think.

I told him it was very unhappy that so much love and so much good nature as I discovered in him should be thus precipitated into misery; that I saw nothing before us but ruin, for as to me, it was my unhappiness that what little I had was not able to relieve us a week, and with that I pulled out a bank bill of £20 and eleven guineas, which I told him I had saved out of my little income; and that by the account that creature had given me of the way of living in that country, I expected it would maintain me three or four years; that if it was taken from me I was left destitute, and he knew what the condition of a woman must be if she had no money in her pocket; however, I told him if he would take it there it was.

He told me with great concern, and I thought I saw tears in his eyes, that he would not touch it, that he abhorred the thoughts of stripping me, and making me miserable; that he had fifty guineas left, which was all he had in the world, and he pulled it out and threw it down on the table, bidding me take it though he were to starve for want of it.

I returned with the same concern for him that I could not bear to hear him talk so; that on the contrary, if he could propose any probable method of living, I would do anything that became me and that I would live as narrow as he could desire.

He begged of me to talk no more at that rate for it would make him distracted; he said he was bred a gentleman though he was reduced to a low fortune, and that there was but one way left which he could think of, and that would not do, unless I could answer him one question, which, however, he said he would not press me to. I told him I would answer it honestly, whether it would be to his satisfaction or no, that I could not tell.

“Why then, my dear, tell me plainly,” says he, “will the little you have keep us together in any figure or in any station or place, or will it not?”

It was my happiness that I had not discovered myself or my circumstances at all; no, not so much as my name, and seeing there was nothing to be expected from him, however good humoured, and however honest he seemed to be, but to live on what I knew would soon be wasted, I resolved to conceal everything but the bank bill and eleven guineas, and I would have been very glad to have lost that, and have been set down where he took me up. I had indeed another bank bill about me of £30, which was the whole of what I brought with me, as well to subsist on in the country, as not knowing what might offer; because this creature, the go-between, that had thus betrayed us both, had made me believe strange things of marrying to my advantage, and I was not willing to be without money whatever might happen. This bill I concealed, and that made me the freer of the rest in consideration of his circumstances, for I really pitied him heartily.

But to return to this question, I told him I never willingly deceived him, and I never would: I was very sorry to tell him that the little I had would not subsist us; that it was not sufficient to subsist me alone in the South Country, and that this was the reason that made me put myself into the hands of that woman who called him brother, she having assured me that I might board very handsomely at a town called Manchester, where I had not yet been, for about six pounds a year; and my whole income not being above £15 a year, I thought I might live easy upon it and wait for better things.

He shook his head and remained silent, and a very melancholy evening we had; however we supped together and lay together that night, and when we had almost supped he looked a little better and more cheerful, and called for a bottle of wine. “Come, my dear,” says he, “though the case is bad, it is to no purpose to be dejected. Come, be as easy as you can, I will endeavour to find out some way or other to live; it you can but subsist yourself, that is better than nothing. I must try the world again; a man ought to think like a man; to be discouraged is to yield to the misfortune.”With this he filled a glass, and drank to me, holding my hand all the while the wine went down, and protesting his main concern was for me.

It was really a true gallant spirit he was of, and it was the more grievous to me: ’tis something of relief even to be undone by a man of honour, rather than by a scoundrel; but here the greatest disappointment was on his side, for he had really spent a great deal of money, and it was very remarkable on what poor terms she proceeded; first, the baseness of the creature herself is to be observed, who for the getting of one hundred pounds herself could be content to let him spend three or four more, though perhaps it was all he had in the world, and more than all; when she had not the least ground more than a little tea-table chat to say that I had any estate, or was a fortune, or the like. It is true the design of deluding a woman of fortune, if I had been so, was base enough; the putting the face of great things upon poor circumstances was a fraud, and bad enough;but the case a little differed too, and that in his favour, for he was not a rake that made a trade to delude women and as some have done, get six or seven fortunes after one another, and then rifle and run away from them; but he was already a gentleman, unfortunate and low, but had lived well; and though if I had had a fortune I should have been enraged at the slut for betraying me, yet really for the man, a fortune would not have been ill bestowed on him, for he was a lovely person indeed; of generous principles, good sense, and of abundance of good humour.

We had a great deal of close conversation that night, for we neither of us slept much; he was as penitent for having put all those cheats upon me as if it had been felony, and that he was going to execution; he offered me again every shilling of the money he had about him, and said he would go into the army and seek for more.

I asked him why he would be so unkind to carry me into Ireland, when I might suppose he could not have subsisted me there?

He took me in his arms. “My dear,” said he, “I never designed to go to Ireland at all, much less to have carried you thither; but came hither to be out of the observation of the people who had heard what I pretended to, and that nobody might ask me for money before I was furnished to supply them.”

“But where then,” said I, “were we to have gone next?”

“Why, my dear,” said he, “I’ll confess the whole scheme to you, as I had laid it. I purposed here to ask you something about your estate, as you see I did, and when you, as I expected you would, had entered into some account of the particulars, I would have made an excuse to have put off our voyage to Ireland for some time and so have gone for London.”

“Then, my dear,” says he, “I resolved to have confessed all the circumstances of my own affairs to you, and let you know I had indeed made use of these artifices to obtain your consent to marry me, but had now nothing to do but to ask your pardon and to tell you how abundantly I would endeavour to make you forget what was past by the felicity of the days to come.”

“Truly,” said I to him, “I find you would soon have conquered me;and it is my affliction now that I am not in a condition to let you see how easily I should have been reconciled to you, and have passed by all the tricks you had put upon me in recompense of so much good humour; but, my dear,” said I, “what can we do now? We are both undone, and what better are we for our being reconciled, seeing we have nothing to live on?”

We proposed a great many things, but nothing could offer where there was nothing to begin with. He begged me at last to talk no more of it, for he said I would break his heart; so we talked of other things a little, till at last he took a husband’s leave of me and so went to sleep.

He rose before me in the morning, and indeed having lain awake almost all night I was very sleepy, and lay till near seven o’clock. In this time he took his horses, and three servants, and all his linen and baggage, and away he went leaving a short, but moving letter for me on the table, as follows:





My Dear,

I am a dog; I have abused you; but I have been drawn in to do it by a base creature, contrary to my principle, and the general practice of my life: forgive me, my dear! I ask you pardon with the greatest sincerity; I am the most miserable of men in having deluded you. I have been so happy to possess you, and am now so wretched as to be forced to fly from you. Forgive me, my dear, once more I say forgive me! I am not able to see you ruined by me, and myself unable to support you. Our marriage is nothing, I shall never be able to see you again; I here discharge you from it; if you can marry to your advantage do not decline it on my account; I here swear to you on my faith, and on the word of a man of honour, I will never disturb your repose if I should know of it, which however is not likely. On the other hand, if you should not marry and if good fortune should befall me, it shall be all yours wherever you are.

I have put some of the stock of money I have left into your pocket; take places for yourself and your maid in the stage coach and go for London. I hope it will bear your charges thither, without breaking into your own. Again I sincerely ask your pardon, and will do so as often as I shall ever think of you.

Adieu, my dear, for ever,

I am, yours most affectionately,

J. E.

Nothing that ever befell me in my life sank so deep into my heart as this farewell: I reproached him a thousand times in my thoughts for leaving me, for I would have gone with him through the world, if I had begged my bread. I felt in my pocket, and there I found ten guineas, his gold watch, and two little rings, one a small diamond ring worth only about six pound, and the other a plain gold ring.

I sat down and looked upon these things two hours together, and scarce spoke a word till my maid interrupted me by telling me my dinner was ready. I ate but little, and after dinner I fell into a violent fit of crying, every now and then calling him by his name, which was James. “O, Jemy!” said I, “come back, come back. I’ll give you all I have; I’ll beg, I’ll starve with you.” And thus I ran raving about the room several times, and then sat down between whiles, and then walked about again called upon him to come back, and then cried again; and thus I passed the afternoon till about seven o’clock, when it was near dusk in the evening, being August, when to my unspeakable surprise he comes back into the inn, and comes directly up into my chamber.

I was in the greatest confusion imaginable, and so was he too; I could not imagine what should be the occasion of it; and began to be at odds with myself whether to be glad or sorry; but my affection biased all the rest, and it was impossible to conceal my joy, which was too great for smiles, for it burst out into tears. He was no sooner entered the room but he ran to me and took me in his arms, holding me fast and almost stopping my breath with his kisses, but spoke not a word. At length I began, “My dear,” said I, “how could you go away from me?” To which he gave no answer, for it was impossible for him to speak.

When our ecstasies were a little over he told me he was gone above fifteen miles, but it was not in his power to go any farther without coming back to see me again, and to take his leave of me once more.

I told him how I had passed my time, and how loud I had called him to come back again.

He told me he heard me very plain upon Delamere Forest, at a place about twelve miles off. I smiled.

“Nay,” says he. “Do not think I am in jest, for if ever I heard your voice in my life I heard you call me aloud, and sometimes I thought I saw you running after me.”

“Why,” said I, “what did I say?” for I had not named the words to him.

“You called aloud,” says he, “and said, ‘O Jemy! O Jemy! come back, come back.’”

I laughed at him. “My dear,” says he, “do not laugh, for depend upon it I heard your voice as plain as you hear mine now; if you please, I’ll go before a magistrate and make oath of it.”

I then began to be amazed and surprised, and indeed frightened, and told him what I had really done, and how I had called after him, as above. When we had amused ourselves awhile about this I said to him, “Well, you shall go away from me no more, I’ll go all over the world with you rather.” He told me it would be a very difficult thing for him to leave me, but since it must be, he hoped I would make it as easy to me as I could;but as for him, it would be his destruction, that he foresaw.

However, he told me that he had considered he had left me to travel to London alone, which was a long journey; and that as he might as well go that way as any way else, he was resolved to see me thither, or near it;and if he did go away then without taking his leave I should not take it ill of him, and this he made me promise.

He told me how he had dismissed his three servants, sold their horses, and sent the fellows away to seek their fortunes, and all in a little time at a town on the road, I know not where. “And,” says he, “it cost me some tears all alone by myself to think how much happier they were than their master, for they could go to the next gentleman’s house to seek for a service, whereas,” said he, “I knew not whither to go or what to do with myself.”

I told him I was so completely miserable in parting with him, that I could not be worse; and that now he was come again I would not go from him if he would take me with him, let him go whither he would; and in the meantime I agreed that we would go together to London; but I could not be brought to consent he should go away at last, and not take his leave of me; but told him, jesting, that if he did, I would call him back again as loud as I did before. Then I pulled out his watch and gave it him back, and his two rings, and his ten guineas; but he would not take them, which made me much suspect that he resolved to go off upon the road and leave me.

The truth is, the circumstances he was in, the passionate expressions of his letter, the kind gentlemanly treatment I had from him in all this affair, with the concern he showed for me in it, his manner of parting with that large share which he gave me of his litile stock left, all these had joined to make such impressions on me that I could not bear the thoughts of parting with him.

Two days after this we quitted Chester, I in the stage coach and he on horseback. I dismissed my maid at Chester; he was very much against my being without a maid, but she being hired in the country, keeping no servant at London, I told him it would have been barbarous to have taken the poor wench, and have turned her away as soon as I came to Town; and it would also have been a needless charge on the road, so I satisfied him and he was easy on that score.

He came with me as far as Dunstable, within thirty miles of London, and then he told me fate and his own misfortunes obliged him to leave me, and that it was not convenient for him to go to London for reasons which it was of no value to me to know, and I saw him preparing to go. The stage coach we were in did not usually stop at Dunstable, but I desiring it for a quarter of an hour, they were content to stand at an inn door a while and we went into the house.

Being in the inn, I told him I had but one favour more to ask him, and that was that since he could not go any farther he would give me leave to stay a week or two in the town with him, that we might in that time think of something to prevent such a ruinous thing to us both as a final separation would be; and that I had something of moment to offer him, which perhaps he might find practicable to our advantage.

This was too reasonable a proposal to be denied, so he called the landlady of the house, and told her his wife was taken ill, and so ill that she could not think of going any farther in the stage coach, which had tired her almost to death, and asked if she could not get us a lodging for two or three days in a private house where I might rest me a little, for the journey had been too much for me? The landlady, a good sort of a woman, well bred, and very obliging, came immediately to see me; told me she had two or three very good rooms in a part of the house quite out of the noise, and if I saw them she did not doubt but I would like them, and I should have one of her maids that should do nothing else but wait on me. This was so very kind that I could not but accept of it; so I went to look on the rooms and liked them very well, and indeed they were extraordinarily furnished, and very pleasant lodgings; so we paid the stage coach, took out our baggage, and resolved to stay here a while.

Here I told him I would live with him now till all my money was spent, but would not let him spend a shilling of his own. We had some kind squabble about that, but I told him it was the last time I was like to enjoy his company, and I desired he would let me be master in that thing only, and he should govern in everything else, so he acquiesced.

Here one evening taking a walk into the fields, I told him I would now make the proposal to him I had told him of; accordingly I related to him how I had lived in Virginia, that I had a mother, I believed, was alive there still, though my husband was dead some years. I told him that had not my effects miscarried, which by the way I magnified pretty much, I might have been fortune good enough to him to have kept us from being parted in this manner. Then I entered into the manner of peoples settling in those countries, how they had a quantity of land given them by the constitution of the place; and if not, that it might be purchased at so easy a rate that it was not worth naming.

I then gave him a full and distinct account of the nature of planting, how with carrying over but two or three hundred pounds value in English goods, with some servants and tools, a man of application would presently lay a foundation for a family, and in a few years would raise an estate.

I let him into the nature of the product of the earth, how the ground was cured and prepared, and what the usual increase of it was; and demonstrated to him that in a very few years, with such a beginning, we should be as certain of being rich as we were now certain of being poor.

He was surprised at my discourse; for we made it the whole subject of our conversation for near a week together, in which time I laid it down in black and white, as we say, that it was morally impossible, with a supposition of any reasonable good conduct, but that we must thrive there and do very well.

Then I told him what measures I would take to raise such a sum as£300 or thereabouts; and I argued with him how good a method it would be to put an end to our misfortunes, and restore our circumstances in the world to what we had both expected; and I added, that after seven years we might be in a posture to leave our plantation in good hands, and come over again and receive the income of it, and live here and enjoy it; and I gave him examples of some that had done so and lived now in very good figure in London.

In short, I pressed him so to it that he almost agreed to it, but still something or other broke it off; till at last he turned the tables and began to talk almost to the same purpose of Ireland.

He told me that a man that could confine himself to a country life and that could but find stock to enter upon any land, should have farms there for £50 a year, as good as were let here for £200 a year; that the produce was such and so rich the land, that if much was not laid up, we were sure to live as handsomely upon it as a gentleman of £3,000 a year could do in England; and that he had laid a scheme to leave me in London, and go over and try; and if he found he could lay a handsome foundation of living suitable to the respect he had for me, as he doubted not he should do, he would come over and fetch me.

I was dreadfully afraid that upon such a proposal he would have taken me at my word, viz., to turn my little income into money and let him carry it over into Ireland and try his experiment with it; but he was too just to desire it, or to have accepted it if I had offered it; and he anticipated me in that, for he added, that he would go and try his fortune that way, and if he found he could do anything at it to live, then by adding mine to it when I went over, we should live like ourselves; but that he would not hazard a shilling of mine till he had made the experiment with a little, and he assured me that if he found nothing to be done in Ireland he would then come to me and join in my prospect for Virginia.

He was so earnest upon his project being to be tried first that I could not withstand him; however, he promised to let me hear from him in a very little time after his arriving there, to let me know whether his prospect answered his design, that if there was not a probability of success, I might take the occasion to prepare for our other voyage, and then he assured me, he would go with me to America with all his heart.

I could bring him to nothing farther than this, and which entertained us near a month, during which I enjoyed his company, which was the most entertaining that ever I met with in my life before. In this time he let me into part of the story of his own life, which was indeed surprising and full of an infinite variety, sufficient to fill up a much brighter history for its adventures and incidents than any I ever saw in print: but I shall have occasion to say more of him hereafter.

We parted at last, though with the utmost reluctance on my side, and indeed he took his leave very unwillingly too, but necessity obliged him, for his reasons were very good why he would not come to London, as I understood more fully afterwards.

I gave him a direction how to write to me, though still I reserved the grand secret, which was not to let him ever know my true name, who I was, or where to be found; he likewise let me know how to write a letter to him so that he said he would be sure to receive it.

I came to London the next day after we parted, but did not go directly to my old lodgings; but for another nameless reason took a private lodging in St. John’s Street, or as it is vulgarly called St. Jones’s near Clerkenwell;and here being perfectly alone, I had leisure to sit down and reflect seriously upon the last seven months’ ramble I had made, for I had been abroad no less; the pleasant hours I had with my last husband I looked back on with an infinite deal of pleasure; but that pleasure was very much lessened when I found some time after that I was really with child.

This was a perplexing thing because of the difficulty which was before me, where I should get leave to lie-in; it being one of the nicest things in the world at that time of day for a woman that was a stranger and had no friends, to be entertained in that circumstance without security, which I had not, neither could I procure any.

I had taken care all this while to preserve a correspondence with my friend at the bank, or rather he took care to correspond with me, for he wrote to me once a week; and though I had not spent my money so fast as to want any from him, yet I often wrote also to let him know I was alive;I had left directions in Lancashire so that I had these letters conveyed to me; and during my recess at St. Jones’s I received a very obliging letter from him, assuring me that his process for a divorce went on with success though he met with some difficulties in it that he did not expect.

I was not displeased with the news that his process was more tedious than he expected; for though I was in no condition to have had him yet, not being so foolish to marry him when I knew myself to be with child by another man, as some I know have ventured to do; yet I was not willing to lose him, and in a word, resolved to have him if he continued in the same mind, as soon as I was up again; for I saw apparently I should hear no more from my other husband; and as he had all along pressed me to marry, and had assured me he would not be at all disgusted at it or ever offer to claim me again, so I made no scruple to resolve to do it if I could, and if my other friend stood to his bargain; and I had a great deal of reason to be assured that he would by the letters he wrote to me, which were the kindest and most obliging that could be.

I now grew big, and the people where I lodged perceived it, and began to take notice of it to me, and as far as civility would allow, intimated that I must think of removing. This put me to extreme perplexity and I grew very melancholy, for indeed I knew not what course to take;I had money, but no friends, and was like now to have a child upon my hands to keep, which was a difficulty I had never had upon me yet, as my story hitherto makes appear.

In the course of this affair I fell very ill and my melancholy really increased my distemper; my illness proved at length to be only an ague, but my apprehensions were really that I should miscarry. I should not say apprehensions, for indeed I would have been glad to miscarry, but I could never entertain so much as a thought of taking anything to make me miscarry, I abhorred, I say, so much as the thought of it.

However, speaking of it, the gentlewoman who kept the house proposed to me to send for a midwife. I scrupled it at first, but after some time consented, but told her I had no acquaintance with any midwife and so left it to her.

It seems the mistress of the house was not so great a stranger to such cases as mine was as I thought at first she had been, as will appear presently, and she sent for a midwife of the right sort that is to say, the right sort for me.

The woman appeared to be an experienced woman in her business, I mean as a midwife, but she had another calling too, in which she was as expert as most women, if not more.

My landlady had told her I was very melancholy, and that she believed that had done me harm; and once, before me, said to her, “Mrs. B—, I believe this lady’s trouble is of a kind that is pretty much in your way, and therefore if you can do anything for her, pray do, for she is a very civil gentlewoman,” and so she went out of the room.

I really did not understand her, but my Mother Midnight began very seriously to explain what she meant as soon as she was gone:“Madam,” says she, “you seem not to understand what your landlady means, and when you do you need not let her know at all that you do so. She means that you are under some circumstances that may render your lying-in difficult to you, and that you are not willing to be exposed; I need say no more but to tell you, that if you think fit to communicate so much of your case to me as is necessary, for I do not desire to pry into those things, I perhaps may be in a condition to assist you, and to make you easy, and remove all your dull thoughts upon that subject.”

Every word this creature said was a cordial to me and put new life and new spirit into my very heart; my blood began to circulate immediately, and I was quite another body; I ate my victuals again, and grew better presently after it. She said a great deal more to the same purpose, and then having pressed me to be free with her, and promised in the solemnest manner to be secret, she stopped a little as if waiting to see what impression it made on me and what I would say.

I was too sensible of the want I was in of such a woman not to accept her offer. I told her my case was partly as she guessed and partly not, for I was really married and had a husband, though he was so remote at that time as that he could not appear publicly.

She took me short, and told me that was none of her business, all the ladies that came under her care were married women to her. “Every woman,” says she, “that is with child has a father for it, and whether that father was a husband or no husband was no business of hers; her business was to assist me in my present circumstances, whether I had a husband or no; for, madam,” says she, “to have a husband that cannot appear is to have no husband, and therefore whether you are a wife or a mistress is all one to me.”

I found presently that whether I was a whore or a wife, I was to pass for a whore here, so I let that go; I told her it was true as she said, but that however, if I must tell her my case I must tell it her as it was. So I related it as short as I could, and I concluded it to her: “I trouble you with this, madam,” said I, “not that, as you said before, it is much to the purpose in your affair; but this is to the purpose, viz., that I am not in any pain about being seen or being concealed, for ’tis perfectly indifferent to me: but my difficulty is that I have no acquaintance in this part of the nation.”

“I understand you, madam,” says she, “you have no security to bring to prevent the parish impertinences usual in such cases; and perhaps,” says she, “do not know very well how to dispose of the child when it comes.”

“The last,” says I, “is not so much my concern as the first.”

“Well, madam,” answers the midwife, “dare you put yourself into my hands? I live in such a place, though I do not enquire after you, you may enquire after me, my name is B—, I live in such a street,” naming the street, “at the Sign of The Cradle, my profession is a midwife, and I have many ladies that come to my house to lie-in. I have given security to the parish in general to secure them from any charge from what shall come into the world under my roof. I have but one question to ask in the whole affair, madam,” says she, “and if that be answered, you shall be entirely easy of the rest.”

I presently understood what she meant and told her, “Madam, I believe I understand you; I thank God, though I want friends in this part of the world I do not want money, so far as may be necessary, though I do not abound in that neither.” This I added because I would not make her expect great things,

“Well, madam,” says she, “that is the thing indeed without which nothing can be done in these cases; and yet,” says she, “you shall see that I will not impose upon you, or offer anything that is unkind to you, and you shall know everything beforehand, that you may suit yourself to the occasion and be either costly or sparing as you see fit.”

I told her she seemed to be so perfectly sensible of my condition that I had nothing to ask of her but this, that as I had money sufficient but not a great quantity, she would order it so that I might be at as little superfluous charge as possible.

She replied that she should bring in an account of the expenses of it in two or three shapes; I should choose as I pleased; and I desired her to do so.

The next day she brought it, and the copy of her three bills was as follows:

I looked upon all the three bills, and smiled, and told her I did not see but that she was very reasonable in her demands, all things considered, and I did not doubt but her accommodations were good.

She told me, I should be a judge of that, when I saw them.

I told her I was sorry to tell her that I feared I must be her lowest-rated customer, “And perhaps, madam,” said I, “you will make me the less welcome upon that account.”

“No, not at all,” said she, “for where I have one of the third sort, I have two of the second, and four of the first, and I get as much by them in proportion as by any; but if you doubt my care of you I will allow any friend you have to see if you are well waited on or no.”

Then she explained the particulars of her bill. “In the first place, madam,” said she, “I would have you observe, that here is three months’ keeping you at but 10s. a week, I undertake to say you will not complain of my table: I suppose,” says she, “you do not live cheaper where you are now?”

“No, indeed,” said I, “nor so cheap, for I give six shillings per week for my chamber and find my own diet, which costs me a great deal more.”

“Then, madam,” says she, “if the child should not live, as it sometimes happens, there is the minister’s article saved; and if you have no friends to come you may save the expense of a supper; so that take those articles out, madam,” says she, “your lying-in will not cost you above £53s. more than your ordinary charge of living.”

This was the most reasonable thing that I ever heard of; so I smiled and told her I would come and be a customer; but I told her also that as I had two months and more to go, I might perhaps be obliged to stay longer with her than three months, and desired to know if she would not be obliged to remove me before it was proper.

“No,” she said, “her house was large, and besides she never put anybody to remove that had lain-in till they were willing to go; and if she had more ladies offered, she was not so ill beloved among her neighbours but she could provide accommodation for twenty, if there was occasion.”

I found she was an eminent lady in her way, and, in short, I agreed to put myself into her hands. She then talked of other things, looked about into my accommodations where I was, found fault with my wanting attendance and conveniences, and that I should not be used so at her house. I told her I was shy of speaking, for the woman of the house looked stranger, or at least I thought so, since I had been ill, because I was with child; and I was afraid she would put some affront or other upon me, supposing that I had been able to give but a slight account of myself.

“O dear,” says she, “her ladyship is no stranger to these things; she has tried to entertain ladies in your condition but could not secure the parish; and besides, such a nice lady as you take her to be-however, since you are a-going, you shall not meddle with her, but I’ll see you little better looked after while you are here, and it shall not cost you the more neither.”

I did not understand her; however, I thanked her, so we parted. the next morning she sent me a chicken roasted and hot, and a bottle of sherry, and ordered the maid to tell me that she was to wait on me every day as long as I stayed there.

This was surprisingly good and kind and I accepted it very willingly;at night she sent to me again to know if I wanted anything, and to order the maid to come to her in the morning for dinner. The maid had orders to make me some chocolate in the morning before she came away, and at noon she brought me the sweetbread of a breast of veal whole, and a dish of soup for my dinner, and after this manner she nursed me up at a distance, so that I was mightily well pleased and quickly well, for indeed my dejections before were the principal part of my illness.

I expected, as is usually the case among such people, that the servant she sent me would have been some impudent brazen wench of Drury Lane breeding, and I was very uneasy upon that account, so I would not let her lie in the house the first night but had my eyes about me as narrowly as if she had been a public thief.

My gentlewoman guessed presently what was the matter, and sent her back with a short note that I might depend upon the honesty of her maid; that she would be answerable for her upon all accounts; and that she took no servants without very good security. I was then perfectly easy, and indeed the maid’s behaviour spoke for itself, for a modester, quieter, soberer girl never came into anybody’s family, and I found her so afterwards.

As soon as I was well enough to go abroad I went with the maid to see the house, and to see the apartment I was to have; and everything was so handsome and so clean, that, in short, I had nothing to say but was wonderfully pleased with what I had met with, which considering the melancholy circumstances I was in was beyond what I looked for.

It might be expected that I should give some account of the nature of the wicked practices of this woman, in whose hands I was now fallen; but it would be but too much encouragement to the vice to let the world see what easy measures were here taken to rid the women’s burthen of a child clandestinely gotten. This grave matron had several sorts of practice and this was one, that if a child was born though not in her house, for she had the occasion to be called to many private labours, she had people always ready, who for a piece of money would take the child off their hands and off from the hands of the parish too; and those children, as she said, were honestly taken care of. What should become of them all, considering so many as by her account she was concerned with, I cannot conceive.

I had many times discourse upon that subject with her; but she was full of this argument, that she saved the life of many an innocent lamb as she called them, which would perhaps have been murdered; and of many a woman who, made desperate by the misfortune, would otherwise be tempted to destroy their children. I granted her that this was true, and a very commendable thing, provided the poor children fell into good hands afterwards, and were not abused and neglected by the nurses. She answered that she always took care of that, and had no nurses in her business but what were very good people, and such as might be depended upon.

I could say nothing to the contrary, and so was obliged to say,“Madam, I do not question but you do your part, but what those people do is the main question,” and she stopped my mouth again with saying she took the utmost care about it.

The only thing I found in all her conversation on these subjects that gave me any distaste, was that one time in discoursing about my being to far gone with child, she said something that looked as if she could help me off with my burthen sooner, if I was willing; or in English, that she could give me something to make me miscarry, if I had a desire to put an end to my troubles that way. But I soon let her see that I abhorred the thoughts of it; and to do her justice she put it off so cleverly that I could not say she really intended it, or whether she only mentioned the practice as a horrible thing; for she couched her words so well, and took my meaning so quickly, that she gave her negative before I could explain myself.

To bring this part into as narrow a compass as possible, I quitted my lodging at St. Jones’s, and went to my new governess, for so they called her in the house, and there I was indeed treated with so much courtesy, so carefully looked to, and everything so well, that I was surprised at it, and could not at first see what advantage my governess made of it; but I found afterwards that she professed to make no profit of the lodger’s diet, nor indeed could she get much by it, but that her profit lay in the other articles of her management, and she made enough that way, I assure you; for ’tis scarce credible what practice she had, as well abroad as at home, and yet all upon the private account, or in plain English, the whoring account.

While I was in her house, which was near four months, she had no less than twelve ladies of pleasure brought to bed within doors, and I think she had two-and-thirty, or thereabouts under her conduct without doors, whereof one, as nice as she was with me, was lodged with my old landlady at St. Jones’s.

This was a strange testimony of the growing vice of the age, and as bad as I had been myself, it shocked my very senses; I began to nauseate the place I was in, and, above all, the practice; and yet I must say that I never saw, or do I believe there was to be seen, the least indecency in the house the whole time I was there.

Not a man was ever seen to come upstairs, except to visit the lying-in ladies within their month, nor then without the old lady with them, who made it a piece of the honour of her management that no man should touch a woman, no, not his own wife, within the month; nor would she permit any man to lie in the house upon any pretence whatever, no, not though it was with his own wife, and her saying for it was, that she cared not how many children were born in her house, but she would have none got there if she could help it.

It might perhaps be carried farther than was needful, but it was an error of the right hand if it was an error, for by this she kept up the reputation such as it was of her business, and obtained this character, that though she did take care of the women when they were debauched, yet she was not instrumental to their being debauched at all; and yet it was a wicked trade she drove too.

While I was here and before I was brought to bed, I received a letter from my trustee at the bank full of kind obliging things, and earnestly pressing me to return to London, It was near a fortnight old when it came to me because it had first been sent into Lancashire, and then returned to me; he concludes with telling me that he had obtained a decree against his wife, and that he would be ready to make good his engagement to me if I would accept of him, adding a great many protestations of kindness and affection, such as he would have been far from offering if he had know the circumstances I had been in, and which as it was I had been very far from deserving.

I returned an answer to this letter and dated it at Liverpool, but sent it by a messenger alleging that it came in cover to a friend in Town. I gave him joy of his deliverance, but raised some scruples at the lawfulness of his marrying again, and told him I supposed he would consider very seriously upon that point before he resolved on it, the consequence being too great for a man of his judgment to venture rashly upon; so concluded wishing him very well in whatever he resolved, without letting him into anything of my own mind or giving any answer to his proposal of my coming to London to him, but mentioned at a distance my intention to return the latter end of the year, this being dated in April.

I was brought to bed about the middle of May and had another brave boy, and myself in as good condition as usual on such occasions. My governess did her part as a midwife with the greatest art and dexterity imaginable, and far beyond all that ever I had had any experience of before.

Her care of me in my travail and after in my lying-in, was such that if she had been my own mother it could not have been better; let none be encouraged in their loose practices from this dexterous lady’s management, for she is gone to her place and I dare say has left nothing behind her that can or will come up to it.

I think I had been brought to bed about twenty days when I received another letter from my friend at the bank, with the surprising news that he had obtained a final sentence of divorce against his wife, and had served her with it on such a day, and that he had such an answer to give to all my scruples about his marrying again as I could not expect, and as he had no desire of; for that his wife, who had been under some remorse before for her usage of him, as soon as she heard that he had gained his point, had very unhappily destroyed herself that same evening.

He expressed himself very handsomely as to his being concerned at her disaster, but cleared himself of having any hand in it, and that he had only done himself justice in a case in which he was notoriously injured and abused. However, he said that he was extremely afflicted at it, and had no view of any satisfaction left in this world, but only in the hope that I would come and relieve him by my company; and then he pressed me violently indeed to give him some hopes that I would at least come up to town and let him see me, when he would further enter into discourse about it.

I was exceedingly surprised at the news, and began now seriously to reflect on my circumstances, and the inexpressible misfortune it was to have a child upon my hands, and what to do in it I knew not. At last I opened my case at a distance to my governess, I appeared melancholy for several days, and she lay at me continually to know what troubled me. I could not for my life tell her that I had an offer of marriage, after I had so often told her that I had a husband, so that I really knew not what to say to her. I owned I had something which very much troubled me, but at the same time told her I could not speak of it to anyone alive.

She continued importuning me several days, but it was impossible, I told her, for me to commit the secret to anybody. This, instead of being an answer to her, increased her importunities; she urged her having been trusted with the greatest secrets of this nature, that it was her business to conceal everything, and that to discover things of that nature would be her ruin; she asked me if ever I had found her tattling of other people’s affairs, and how could I suspect her? She told me to unfold myself to her was telling it to nobody; that she was silent as death, that it must be a very strange case indeed that she could not help me out of; but to conceal it was to deprive myself of all possible help, or means of help, and to deprive her of the opportunity of serving me. In short, she had such a bewitching eloquence, and so great a power of persuasion, that there was no concealing anything from her.

So I resolved to unbosom myself to her. I told her the history of my Lancashire marriage, and how both of us had been disappointed; how we came together, and how we parted; how he discharged me as far as lay in him and gave me free liberty to marry again, protesting that if he knew it he would never claim me or disturb or expose me; that I thought I was free, but was dreadfully afraid to venture for fear of the consequences that might follow in case of a discovery.

Then I told her what a good offer I had; showed her my friend’s letter, inviting me to London, and with what affection they were written, but blotted out the name, and also the story about the disaster of his wife, only that she was dead.

She fell a-laughing at my scruples about marrying, and told me the other was no marriage but a cheat on both sides; and that as we were parted by mutual consent the nature of the contract was destroyed, and the obligation was mutually discharged. She had arguments for this at the tip of her tongue; and, in short, reasoned me out of my reason; not but that it was too by the help of my own inclination.

But then came the great and main difficulty, and that was the child;this she told me must be removed, and that so as that it should never be possible for anyone to discover it. I knew there was no marrying without concealing that I had had a child, for he would soon have discovered by the age of it that it was born, nay, and gotten too, since my parley with him, and that would have destroyed all the affair.

But it touched my heart so forcibly to think of parting entirely with the child, and, for ought I knew of having it murdered, or starved by neglect and ill-usage, which was much the same, that I could not think of it without horror. I wish all those women who consent to the disposing their children out of the way, as it is called, for decency sake, would consider that ’tis only a contrived method for murder; that is to say, killing their children with safety.

It is manifest to all that understand anything of children, that we are born into the world helpless and uncapable either to supply our own wants or so much as make them known; and that without help we must perish;and this help requires not only an assisting hand, whether of the mother or somebody else; but there are two things necessary in that assisting hand, that is, care and skill; without both which half the children that are born would die; nay, though they were not to be denied food; and one half more of those that remained would be cripples or fools, lose their limbs, and perhaps their sense. I question not but that these are partly the reasons why affection was placed by Nature in the hearts of mothers to their children; without which they would never be able to give themselves up, as ’tis necessary they should, to the care and waking pains needful to the support of children.

Since this care is needful to the life of children, to neglect them is to murder them; again, to give them up to be managed by those people who have none of that needful affection placed by Nature in them, is to neglect them in the highest degree; nay, in some it goes farther, and is in order to their being lost; so that ’tis an intentional murder, whether the child lives or dies.

All those things represented themselves to my view, and that in the blackest and most frightful form; and as I was very free with my governess who I had now learned to call “Mother”; I represented to her all the dark thoughts which I had about it, and told her what distress I was in. She seemed graver by much at this part than at the other; but as she was hardened in these things beyond all possibility of being touched with the religious part, and the scruples about the murder; so she was equally impenetrable in that part which related to affection: she asked me if she had not been careful and tender of me in my lying-in as if I had been her own child? I told her I owned she had.

“Well, my dear,” says she, “and when you are gone what are you to me? and what would it be to me if you were to be hanged? Do you think there are not women, who as it is their trade and they get their bread by it, value themselves upon their being as careful of children as their own mothers? Yes, yes, child,” says she, “fear it not, how were we nursed ourselves? Are you sure you were nursed up by your own mother? and yet you look fat and fair, child,” says the old beldam, and with that she stroked me over the face. “Never be concerned, child,” says she, going on in her drolling way: “I have no murderers about me, I employ the best nurses that can be had; and have as few children miscarry under their hands as there would if they were all nursed by mothers; we want neither care nor skill.”

She touched me to the quick when she asked if I was sure that I was nursed by my own mother. On the contrary I was sure I was not; and I trembled and looked pale at the very expression. Sure, said I to myself, this creature cannot be a witch, or have any conversation with a spirit that can inform her what I was, before I was able to know it myself; and I looked at her as if I had been frighted; but reflecting that it could not be possible for her to know anything about me, that went off, and I began to be easy, but it was not presently.

She perceived the disorder I was in, but did not know the meaning of it; so she run on in her wild talk upon the weakness of my supposing that children were murdered because they were not all nursed by the mother;and to persuade me that the children she disposed of were as well used as if the mothers had the nursing of them themselves.

“It may be true, mother,” says I, “for ought I know, but my doubts are very strongly grounded.”

“Come, then,” says she, “let’s hear some of them.”

“Why, first,” says I, “you give a piece of money to these people to take the child off the parents’ hands, and to take care of it as long as it lives; now we know, mother,” said I, “that those are poor people, and their gain consists in being quit of the charge as soon as they can; how can I doubt but that, as it is best for them to have the child die, they are not over-solicitous about its life?”

“This is all vapours and fancy,” says she. “I tell you their credit depends upon the child’s life, and they are as careful as any mother of you all.”

“O, mother,” says I, “if I was but sure my little baby would be carefully looked to and have justice done it, I should be happy; but it is impossible I can be satisfied in that point unless I saw it, and to see it would be ruin and destruction as my case now stands, so what to do I know not.”

“A fine story!” says the governess. “You would see the child, and you would not see the child; you would be concealed and discovered both together; these are things impossible, my dear, and so you must even do as other conscientious mothers have done before you; and be contented with things as they must be, though not as you wish them to be.”

I understood what she meant by conscientious mothers, she would have said conscientious whores; but she was not willing to disoblige me, for really in this case I was not a whore because legally married, the force of my former marriage excepted.

However, let me be what I would, I was not come up to that pitch of hardness common to the profession; I mean to be unnatural, and regardless of the safety of my child, and I preserved this honest affection so long that I was upon the point of giving up my friend at the bank, who lay so hard at me to come to him and marry him, that there was hardly any room to deny him.

At last my old governess came to me with her usual assurance.“Come, my dear,” says she, “I have found out a way how you shall be at a certainty, that your child shall be used well, and yet the people that take care of it shall never know you.”

“O mother,” says I, “if you can do so you will engage me to you for ever.”

“Well,” says she, “are you willing to be at some small annual expense, more than what we usually give to the people we contract with?”

“Ay,” says I, “with all my heart, provided I may be concealed.”

“As to that,” says she, “you shall be secure, for the nurse shall never dare to enquire about you, and you shall once or twice a year go with me and see your child, and see how ’tis used, and be satisfied that it is in good hands, nobody knowing who you are.”

“Why,” said I, “do you think that when I come to see my child I shall be able to conceal my being the mother of it? Do you think that possible?”

“Well,” says she, “if you discover it, the nurse shall be never the wiser: she shall be forbid to take any notice; if she offers it she shall lose money which you are to be supposed to give her, and the child be taken from her too.”

I was very well pleased with this; so the next week a country woman was brought from Hertford or thereabouts, who was to take the child off our hands entirely for £10 in money; but if I would allow £5 a year more to her she would be obliged to bring the child to my governess’s house as often as we desired, or we should come down and look at it and see how well she used it.

The woman was a very wholesome-looked, likely woman, a cottager’s wife, but she had very good clothes and linen and everything well about her, and with a heavy heart and many a tear I let her have my child. I had been down at Hertford and looked at her, and at her dwelling, which I liked well enough; and I promised her great things if she would be kind to the child, so she knew at first word that I was the child’s mother; but she seemed to be so much out of the way, and to have no room to enquire after me, that I thought I was safe enough, so in short, I consented to let her have the child, and I gave her £10, that is to say I gave it to my governess, who gave it the poor woman before my face, she agreeing never to return the child back to me, or to claim anything more for its keeping or bringing up; only that I promised if she took a great deal of care of it I would give her something more as often as I came to see it;so that I was not bound to pay the £5 only that I promised my governess I would do it. And thus my great care was over, after a manner, which though it did not at all satisfy my mind, yet was the most convenient for me as my affairs then stood, of any that could be thought of at that time.

I then began to write to my friend at the bank in a more kindly style, and particularly about the beginning of July I sent him a letter that I purposed to be in Town some time in August. He returned me an answer in the most passionate terms imaginable, and desired me to let him have timely notice, and he would come and meet me two days’ journey. This puzzled me scurvily, and I did not know what answer to make to it. Once I was resolved to take the stage coach to West Chester, on purpose only to have the satisfaction of coming back, that he might see me really come in the same coach; for I had a jealous thought, though I had no ground for it at all, lest he should think I was not really in the country.

I endeavoured to reason myself out of it, but it was in vain, the impression lay so strong on my mind that it was not to be resisted. At last it came as an addition to my new design of going into the country, that it would be an excellent blind to my old governess, and would cover entirely all my other affairs, for she did not know in the least whether my new lover lived in London or in Lancashire, and when I told her my resolution she was fully persuaded it was in Lancashire.

Having taken my measures for this journey I let her know it and sent the maid that tended me from the beginning to take a place for me in the coach. She would have had me let the maid have waited on me down to the last stage and come up again in the waggon, but I convinced her it would not be convenient; when I went away, she told me, she would enter into no measures for correspondence, for she saw evidently that my affection to my child would cause me to write to her, and to visit her too, when I came to Town again. I assured her it would, and so took my leave, well satisfied to have been freed from such a house, however good my accommodations there had been.

I took the place in the coach not to its full extent but to a place called Stone, in Cheshire, where I not only had no manner of business but not the least acquaintance with any person in the town. But I knew that with money in the pocket one is at home anywhere; so I lodged there two or three days, till watching my opportunity, I found room in another stage coach and took passage back again for London, sending a letter to my gentleman that I should be such a certain day at Stony-Stratford, where the coachman told me he was to lodge.

It happened to be a chance coach that I had taken up, which having been hired on purpose to carry some gentlemen to West Chester who were going for Ireland, was now returning, and did not tie itself up to exact times or places, as the stages did, so that having been obliged to lie still on Sunday, he had time to get himself ready to come out, which otherwise he could not have done.

His warning was so short, that he could not reach Stony-Stratford time enough to be with me at night, but he met me at a place called Brickill the next morning, just as we were coming into the town.

I confess I was very glad to see him, for I thought myself a little disappointed overnight. He pleased me doubly too by the figure he came in, for he brought a very handsome (gentleman’s) coach and four horses, with a servant to attend him.

He took me out of the stage coach immediately, which stopped at an inn in Brickill, and putting into the same inn he set up his own coach and bespoke his dinner. I asked him what he meant by that, for I was for going forward with the journey. He said, no, I had need of a little rest upon the road, and that was a very good sort of a house, though it was but a little town; so we would go no farther that night, whatever came of it.

I did not press him much, for since he had come so far to meet me, and put himself to so much expense, it was but reasonable I should oblige him a little too, so I was easy as to that point.

After dinner we walked to see the town, to see the church, and to view the fields and the country, as is usual for strangers to do, and our landlord was our guide in going to see the church. I observed my gentleman enquired pretty much about the parson, and I took the hint immediately that he certainly would propose to be married; and it followed presently, that in short I would not refuse him; for to be plain, with my circumstances, I was in no condition now to say “No,” I had no reason now to run any more such hazards.

But while these thoughts run round in my head, which was the work but of a few moments, I observed my landlord took him aside and whispered to him, though not very softly neither, for so much I overheard,“Sir, if you shall have occasion—”the rest I could not hear, but it seems it was to this purpose, “Sir, if you shall have occasion for a minister, I have a friend a little way off that will serve you, and be as private as you please.”

My gentleman answered loud enough for me to hear, “Very well, I believe I shall.”

I was no sooner come back to the inn, but he fell upon me with irresistible words, that since he had had the good fortune to meet me and everything concurred, it would be hastening his felicity if I would put an end to the matter just there.

“What do you mean?” says I, colouring a little, “What, in an inn, and on the road? Bless us all,” said I, “how can you talk so?”

“O, I can talk so very well,” says he. “I came on purpose to talk so, and I’ll show you that I did,” and with that he pulls out a great bundle of papers.

“You fright me,” said I, “what are all these?”

“Don’t be frighted, my dear,” said he, and kissed me—this was the first time that he had been so free to call me “my dear”—then he repeated it, “Don’t be frighted, you shall see what it is all.” Then he laid them all abroad; there was first the deed or sentence of divorce from his wife, and the full evidence of her playing the whore; then there was the certificates of the minister and churchwardens of the parish where she lived proving that she was buried, and intimating the manner of her death; the copy of the coroner’s warrant for a jury to sit upon her and the verdict of the jury, who brought it in non compos mentis:all this was to give me satisfaction, though by the way I was not so scrupulous, had he known all, but that I might have taken him without it. However, I looked them all over as well as I could and told him that this was all very clear indeed, but that he need not have brought them out with him, for it was time enough.

“Well,” he said, “it might be time enough for me, but no time but the present time was time enough for him.”

There were other papers rolled up, and I asked him what they were.

“Why, ay,” says he, “that’s the question I wanted to have you ask me;” so he takes out a little shagreen case, and gives me out of it a very fine diamond ring. I could not refuse it, if I had a mind to do so, for he put it upon my finger; so I only made him a curtsy. Then he takes out another ring, “And this,” says he, “is for another occasion,” and puts that into his pocket.

“Well, but let me see it though,” says I and smiled. “I guess what it is, I think you are mad.”

“I should have been mad if I had done less,” says he, and still he did not show it me, and I had a great mind to see it.

So I says, “Well, but let me see it.”

“Hold,” says he, “first look here,” then he took up the roll again and read it, and behold! it was a licence for us to be married.

“Why,” says I, “are you distracted? You were fully satisfied sure that I would yield at first word, or resolved to take no denial.”

“The last is certainly the case,” said he.

“But you may be mistaken,” said I.

“No, no,” says he, “I must not be denied, I can’t be denied,” and with that he fell to kissing me so violently I could not get rid of him.

There was a bed in the room and we were walking to and again, eager in the discourse. At last he takes me by surprise in his arms and threw me on the bed and himself with me, and holding me still fast in his arms, but without the least offer of any indecency, courted me to consent with such repeated entreaties and arguments, protesting his affection, and vowing he would not let me go till I had promised him, that at last I said,“Why, you resolve not to be denied indeed, I think.”

“No, no,” says he, “I must not be denied, I won’t be denied, I can’t be denied.”

“Well, well,” said I, and giving him a slight kiss, “then you shan’t be denied. Let me get up.”

He was so transported with my consent, and the kind manner of it, that I began to think once he took it for a marriage, and would not stay for the form; but I wronged him, for he took me by the hand, pulled me up again, and then giving me two or three kisses, thanked me for my kind yielding to him; and was so overcome with the satisfaction of it that I saw tears stand in his eyes.

I turned from him, for it filled my eyes with tears too; and asked him leave to retire a little to my chamber. If I had a grain of true repentance for an abominable life of twenty-four years past, it was then. Oh, what a felicity is it to mankind, said I to myself, that they cannot see into the hearts of one another! How happy had it been if I had been wife to a man of so much honesty and so much affection from the beginning!

Then it occurred to me what an abominable creature am I; And how is this innocent gentleman going to be abused by me! How little does he think that having divorced a whore, he is throwing himself into the arms of another; that he is going to marry one that has lain with two brothers, and has had three children by her own brother; one that was born in Newgate, whose mother was a whore, and is now a transported thief; one that has lain with thirteen men, and has had a child since he saw me? Poor gentleman! said I, what he is going to do! After this reproaching myself was over, it followed thus: Well, if I must be his wife, if it please God to give me grace, I’ll be a true wife to him and love him suitably to the strange excess of his passion for me; I will make him amends by what he shall see for the abuses I put upon him, which he does not see.

He was impatient for my coming out of my chamber, but finding me long, he went downstairs and talked with my landlord about the parson.

My landlord, an officious, though well-meaning fellow, had sent away for the clergyman; and when my gentleman began to speak to him of sending for him, “Sir,” says he to him, “my friend is in the house;”so without any more words he brought them together. When he came to the minister, he asked him if he would venture to marry a couple of strangers that were both willing? The parson said that Mr.—had said something to him of it; that he hoped it was no clandestine business; that he seemed to be a grave gentleman, and he supposed madam was not a girl, so that the consent of friends should be wanted.

“To put you out of doubt of that,” says my gentleman, “read this paper,” and out he pulls the licence.

“I am satisfied,” says the minister. “where is the lady?”

“You shall see her presently,” says my gentleman.

When he had said thus he comes upstairs, and I was by that time come out of my room, so he tells me the minister was below and that upon showing him the licence he was free to marry us with all his heart, but he asks to see you; so he asked if I would let him come up.

“’Tis time enough,” said I, “in the morning, is it not?”

“Why,” said he, “my dear, he seemed to scruple whether it was not some young girl stolen from her parents, and I assured him we were both of age to command our own consent; and that made him ask to see you.”

“Well,” said I, “do as you please.” so up they bring the parson, and a merry good sort of gentleman he was: he had been told, it seems, that we had met there by accident, that I came in a Chester coach, and my gentleman in his own coach to meet me; that we were to have met last night at Stony-Stratford, but that he could not reach so far.

“Well, sir,” says the parson, “every ill turn has some good in it;the disappointment, sir,” says he to my gentleman, “was yours, and the good turn is mine, for if you had met at Stony-Stratford I had not had the honour to marry you. Landlord, have you a Common Prayer Book?”

I started as if I had been frighted, “Sir,” says I, “what do you mean? What, to marry in an inn, and at night too?”

“Madam,” said the minister, “if you will have it be in the church you shall; but I assure you your marriage will be as firm here as in the church;we are not tied by the canons to marry nowhere but in the church; and as for the time of day it does not at all weigh in this case, our princes are married in their chambers and at eight or ten o’clock at night.”

I was a great while before I could be persuaded, and pretended not to be willing at all to be married but in the church; but it was all grimace;so I seemed at last to be prevailed on, and my landlord and his wife and daughter were called up. My landlord was father and clerk and all together, and we were married, and very merry we were; though I confess the self-reproaches which I had upon me before lay close to me, and extorted every now and then a deep sigh from me, which my bridegroom took notice of, and endeavoured to encourage me, thinking, poor man, that I had some little hesitations at the step I had taken so hastily.

We enjoyed ourselves that evening completely, and yet all was kept so private in the inn that not a servant in the house knew of it, for my landlady and her daughter waited on me, and would not let any of the maids come upstairs. My landlady’s daughter I called my bridemaid; and sending for a shopkeeper the next morning, I gave the young woman a good suit of knots, as good as the town would afford, and finding it was a lacemaking town, I gave her mother a piece of bone lace for a head.

One reason that my landlord was so close was that he was unwilling the minister of the parish should hear of it; but for all that somebody heard of it, so as that we had the bells set a-ringing the next morning early, and the music, such as the town would afford, under our window; but my landlord brazened it out that we were married before we came thither, only that being his former guests we would have our wedding supper at his house.

We could not find in our hearts to stir the next day; for, in short, having been disturbed by the bells in the morning and having perhaps not slept overmuch before, we were so sleepy afterwards that we lay in bed till almost twelve o’clock.

I begged my landlady that we might have no more music in the town, nor ringing of bells, and she managed it so well that we were very quiet. But an odd passage interrupted all my mirth for a good while. The great room of the house looked into the street, and I had walked to the end of the room, and it being a pleasant warm day, I had opened the window and was standing at it for some air, when I saw three gentlemen ride by, and go into an inn just against us.

It was not to be concealed, nor did it leave me any room to question it, but the second of the three was my Lancashire husband. I was frighted to death, I never was in such a consternation in my life, I thought I should have sunk into the ground, my blood run chill in my veins, and I trembled as if I had been in a cold fit of ague; I say, there was no room to question the truth of it, I knew his clothes, I knew his horse, and I knew his face.

The first reflection I made was that my husband was not by to see my disorder, and that I was very glad of. The gentlemen had not been long in the house but they came to the window of their room, as is usual;but my window was shut, you may be sure. However, I could not keep from peeping at them and there I saw him again, heard him call to one of the servants for something he waited, and received all the terrifying confirmations of its being the same person, that were possible to be had.

My next concern was to know what was his business there; but that was impossible; sometimes my imagination formed an idea of one frightful thing, sometimes of another; sometimes I thought he had discovered me, and was come to upbraid me with ingratitude and breach of honour; then I fancied he was coming upstairs to insult me; and innumerable thoughts came into my head of what was never in his head, nor ever could be, unless the devil had revealed it to him.

I remained in the fright near two hours and scarce ever kept my eye from the window or door of the inn where they were. At last hearing a great clutter in the passage of their inn I ran to the window, and, to my great satisfaction, I saw them all three go out again and travel on westward. Had they gone towards London I should have been still in a fright, lest I should meet him again, and that he should know me; but he went the contrary way, and so I was eased of that disorder.

We resolved to be going the next day, but about six o’clock at night we were alarmed with a great uproar in the street, and people riding as if they had been out of their wits, and what was it but a hue-and-cry after three highway-men that had robbed two coaches and some travellers near Dunstable Hill, and notice had it seems been given that they had been seen at Brickill at such a house, meaning the house where those gentlemen had been.

The house was immediately beset and searched, but there were witnesses enough that the gentlemen had been gone above three hours;the crowd having gathered about, we had the news presently; and I was heartily concerned now another way. I presently told the people of the house, that I durst say those were honest persons, for that I knew one of the gentlemen to be a very honest person, and of a good estate in Lancashire.

The constable, who came with the hue-and cry, was immediately informed of this and came over to me to be satisfied from my own mouth, and I assured him that I saw the three gentlemen as I was at the window, that I saw them afterwards at the windows of the room they dined in;that I saw them take horse, and I would assure him I knew one of them to be such a man, that he was a gentleman of a very good estate, and an undoubted character in Lancashire, from whence I was just now upon my journey.

The assurance with which I delivered this gave the mob gentry a check, and gave the constable such satisfaction that he immediately sounded a retreat, told his people these were not the men, but that he had an account they were very honest gentlemen, and so they went all back again. What the truth of the matter was I knew not, but certain it was that the coaches were robbed at Dunstable Hill, and £560 in money taken, besides, some of the lace merchants that always travel that way had been visited too; as to the three gentlemen, that remains to be explained hereafter.

Well, this alarm stopped us another day, though my spouse told me it was always safest travelling after a robbery, for that the thieves were sure to be gone far enough off when they had alarmed the country; but I was uneasy, and indeed principally lest my old acquaintance should be upon the road still and should chance to see me.

I never lived four pleasanter days together in my life. I was a mere bride all this while, and my new spouse strove to make me easy in everything. O could this state of life have continued! How had all my past troubles been forgot, and my future sorrows been avoided! But I had a past life of a most wretched kind to account for, some of it in this world as well as in another.

We came away the fifth day; and my landlord, because he saw me uneasy, mounted himself, his son, and three honest country fellows, with good firearms, and without telling us of it, followed the coach, and would see us safe into Dunstable; we could do no less than treat them very handsomely at Dunstable, which cost my spouse about ten or twelve shillings, and something he gave the men for their time too, but my landlord would take nothing for himself.

This was the most happy contrivance for me that could have fallen out, for had I come to London unmarried, I must either have come to him for the first night’s entertainment, or have discovered to him that I had not one acquaintance in the whole city of London that could receive a poor bride for the first night’s lodging with her spouse. But now I made no scruple of going directly home with him, and there I took possession at once of a house well furnished, and a husband in very good circumstances, so that I had a prospect of a very happy life, if I knew how to manage it; and I had leisure to consider of the real value of the life I was likely to live; how different it was to be from the loose part I had acted before, and how much happier a life of virtue and sobriety is, than that which we call a life of pleasure.

O had this particular scene of life lasted, or had I learnt from that time I enjoyed it to have tasted the true sweetness of it, and had I not fallen into that poverty which is the sure bane of virtue, how happy had I been, not only here, but perhaps for ever! for while I lived thus I was really a penitent for all my life passed. I looked back on it with abhorrence, and might truly be said to hate myself for it. I often reflected how my lover at Bath, struck by the hand of God, repented and abandoned me, and refused to see me any more, though he loved me to an extreme; but I, prompted by that worst of devils, poverty, returned to the vile practice, and made the advantage of what they call a handsome face be the relief to my necessities, and beauty be a pimp to vice.

Now I seemed landed in a safe harbour after the stormy voyage of life past was at an end; and I began to be thankful for my deliverance. I sat many an hour by myself, and wept over the remembrance of past follies, and the dreadful extravagances of a wicked life, and sometimes I flattered myself that I had sincerely repented.

But there are temptations which it is not in the power of human nature to resist, and few know what would be their case if driven to the same exigencies. As covetousness is the root of all evil, so poverty is the worst of all snares: but I waive that discourse till I come to the experiment.

I lived with this husband in the utmost tranquillity; he was a quiet, sensible, sober man, virtuous, modest, sincere, and in his business diligent and just: his business was in a narrow compass, and his income sufficient to a plentiful way of living in the ordinary way; I do not say to keep an equipage, and make a figure as the world calls it, nor did I expect it or desire it; for as I abhorred the levity and extravagance of my former life, so I chose now to live retired, frugal, and within ourselves. I kept no company, made no visits; minded my family, and obliged my husband;and this kind of life became a pleasure to me.

We lived in an uninterrupted course of ease and content for five years, when a sudden blow from an almost invisible hand blasted all my happiness, and turned me out into the world in a condition the reverse of all that had been before it.

My husband having trusted one of his fellow clerks with a sum of money too much for our fortunes to bear the loss of, the clerk failed, and the loss fell very heavy on my husband. Yet it was not so great but that if he had had courage to have looked his misfortunes in the face, his credit was so good that as I told him, he would easily recover it; for to sink under trouble is to double the weight, and he that will die in it, shall die in it.

It was in vain to speak comfortably to him, the wound had sunk too deep, it was a stab that touched the vitals. He grew melancholy and disconsolate, and from thence lethargic, and died. I foresaw the blow, and was extremely oppressed in my mind, for I saw evidently that if he died I was undone.

I had had two children by him and no more, for it began to be time for me to leave bearing children, for I was now eight-and-forty, and I suppose if he had lived I should have had no more.

I was now left in a dismal and disconsolate case indeed, and in several things worse than ever. First it was past the flourishing time with me when I might expect to be courted for a mistress; that agreeable part had declined some time, and the ruins only appeared of what had been;and that which was worse than all was this, that I was the most dejected, disconsolate creature alive. I that had encouraged my husband, and endeavoured to support his spirits under his trouble, could not support my own. I wanted that spirit in trouble which I told him was so necessary for bearing the burthen.

But my case was indeed deplorable, for I was left perfectly friendless and helpless, and the loss my husband had sustained had reduced his circumstances so low that though indeed I was not in debt, yet I could easily foresee that what was left would not support me long; that it wasted daily for subsistence, so that it would be soon all spent, and then I saw nothing before me but the utmost distress, and this represented itself so lively to my thoughts that it seemed as if it was come before it was really very near. Also my very apprehensions doubled the misery, for I fancied every sixpence that I paid for a loaf of bread was the last I had in the world, and that tomorrow I was to fast, and be starved to death.

In this distress I had no assistant, no friend to comfort or advise me. I sat and cried and tormented myself night and day; wringing my hands, and sometimes raving like a distracted woman; and indeed I have often wondered it had not affected my reason, for I had the vapours to such a degree that my understanding was sometimes quite lost in fancies and imaginations.

I lived two years in this dismal condition, wasting that little I had, weeping continually over my dismal circumstances, and as it were only bleeding to death, without the least hope or prospect of help; and now I had cried so long and so often, that tears were exhausted, and I began to be desperate, for I grew poor apace.

For a little relief I had put off my house and took lodgings; and as I was reducing my living, so I sold off most of my goods, which put a little money in my pocket, and I lived near a year upon that, spending very sparingly, and eking things out to the utmost; but still when I looked before me my heart would sink within me at the inevitable approach of misery and want. O let none read this part without seriously reflecting on the circumstances of a desolate state, and how they would grapple with want of friends and want of bread; it will certainly make them think not of sparing what they have only, but of looking up to heaven for support, and of the wise man’s prayer, “Give me not poverty lest I steal.”

Let ’em remember that a time of distress is a time of dreadful temptation, and all the strength to resist is taken away; poverty presses, the soul is made desperate by distress, and what can be done? It was one evening when being brought, as I may say, to the last gasp, I think I may truly say I was distracted and raving, when prompted by I know not what spirit, and, as it were, doing I did not know what, or why, I dressed me, for I had still pretty good clothes, and went out. I am very sure I had no manner of design in my head when I went out, I neither knew or considered where to go, or on what business; but as the devil carried me out, and laid his bait for me, so he brought me to be sure to the place, for I knew not whither I was going or what I did.

Wandering thus about I knew not whither, I passed by an apothecary’s shop in Leadenhall Street, where I saw lie on a stool just before the counter a little bundle wrapped in a white cloth. Beyond it stood a maidservant with her back to it, looking up towards the top of the shop, where the apothecary’s apprentice, as I suppose, was standing up on the compter, with his back also to the door, and a candle in his hand, looking and reaching up to the upper shelf for something he wanted, so that both were engaged, and nobody else in the shop.

This was the bait; and the devil who laid the snare prompted me, as if he had spoke, for I remember, and shall never forget it, ’twas like a voice spoken over my shoulder, Take the bundle; be quick; do it this moment. It was no sooner said but I stepped into the shop, and with my back to the wench, as if I had stood up for a cart that was going by, I put my hand behind me and took the bundle, and went off with it, the maid or fellow not perceiving me, or anyone else.

It is impossible to express the horror of my soul all the while I did it. When I went away I had no heart to run, or scarce to mend my pace; I crossed the street indeed, and went down the first turning I came to, and I think it was a street that went through into Fenchurch Street; from thence I crossed and turned through so many ways and turnings, that I could never tell which way it was, nor where I went, I felt not the ground I stepped on, and the farther I was out of danger, the faster I went, till tired and out of breath, I was forced to sit down on a little bench at a door, and then found I was got into Thames Street, near Billingsgate. I rested me a little and went on, my blood was all in a fire, my heart beat as if I was in a sudden fright: in short, I was under such a surprise that I knew not whither I was a-going, or what to do.

After I had tired myself thus with walking a long way about, and so eagerly, I began to consider and make home to my lodging, where I came about nine o’clock at night.

What the bundle was made up for, or on what occasion laid where I found it, I knew not, but when I came to open it I found there was a suit of child-bed linen in it, very good and almost new, the lace very fine; there was a silver porringer of a pint, a small silver mug and six spoons, with some other linen, a good smock, and three silk handkerchiefs, and in the mug in a paper, eighteen shillings and sixpence in money.

All the while I was opening these things I was under such dreadful impressions of fear, and in such terror of mind, though I was perfectly safe, that I cannot express the manner of it. I sat me down and cried most vehemently: “Lord,” said I, “what am I now? a thief! Why I shall be taken next time and be carried to Newgate and be tried for my life!” and with that I cried again a long time, and I am sure, as poor as I was, if I had durst for fear, I would certainly have carried the things back again;but that went off after a while. Well, I went to bed for that night, but slept little, the horror of the fact was upon my mind, and I knew not what I said or did all night, and all the next day. Then I was impatient to hear some news of the loss, and would fain know how it was, whether they were a poor body’s goods, or a rich. Perhaps, said I, it may be some poor widow like me that had packed up these goods to go and sell them for a little bread for herself and a poor child, and are now starving and breaking their hearts, for want of that little they would have fetched. and this thought tormented me worse than all the rest for three or four days.

But my own distress silenced all these reflections, and the prospect of my own starving, which grew every day more frightful to me, hardened my heart by degrees; it was then particularly heavy upon my mind that I had been reformed and had, as I hoped, repented of all my past wickedness; that I had lived a sober, grave, retired life for several years, but now I should be driven by the dreadful necessity of my circumstances to the gates of destruction, soul and body; and two or three times I fell upon my knees, praying to God as well as I could for deliverance; but I cannot but say my prayers had no hope in them; I knew not what to do, it was all fear without and dark within; and I reflected on my past life as not repented of, that heaven was now beginning to punish me, and would make me as miserable as I had been wicked.

Had I gone on here I had perhaps been a true penitent; but I had an evil counsellor within, and he was continually prompting me to relieve myself by the worst means; so one evening he tempted me again by the same wicked impulse that had said, take that bundle, to go out again and seek for what might happen.

I went out now by daylight, and wandered about I knew not whither, and in search of I knew not what, when the devil put a snare in my way of a dreadful nature indeed, and such a one as I have never had before or since. Going through Aldersgate Street there was a pretty little child had been at a dancing school, and was a-going home all alone, and my prompter, like a true devil, set me upon this innocent creature. I talked to it, and it prattled to me again, and I took it by the hand and led it along till I came to a paved alley that goes into Bartholomew Close, and I led it in there. The child said that was not its way home. I said, “Yes, my dear, it is. I’ll show you the way home.” The child had a little necklace on of gold beads, and I had my eye upon that, and in the dark of the alley I stooped, pretending to mend the child’s clog that was loose, and took off her necklace, and the child never felt it; and so led the child on again. Here, I say, the devil put me upon killing the child in the dark alley that it might not cry, but the very thought frighted me so that I was ready to drop down, but I turned the child about and bade it go back again, for that was not its way home. The child said so she would, and I went through into Bartholomew Close, and then turned round to another passage that goes into Long Lane, so away into Charterhouse Yard, and out into St. John’s Street; then crossing into Smithfield, went down Chick Lane, and into Field Lane to Holborn Bridge, when mixing with the crowd of people usually passing there, it was not possible to have been found out; and thus I made my second sally into the world.

The thoughts of this booty put out all the thoughts of the first, and the reflections I had made wore quickly off; poverty hardened my heart, and my own necessities made me regardless of anything. The last affair left no great concern upon me, for as I did the poor child no harm, I only thought I had given the parents a just reproof for their negligence in leaving the poor lamb to come home by itself, and it would teach them to take more care another time.

This string of beads was worth about twelve or fourteen pounds. I suppose it might have been formerly the mother’s, for it was too big for the child’s wear, but that, perhaps, the vanity of the mother to have her child look fine at the dancing school had made her let the child wear it, and no doubt the child had a maid sent to take care of it, but she, like a careless jade, was taken up perhaps with some fellow that had met her, and so the poor baby wandered till it fell into my hands.

However, I did the child no harm. I did not so much as fright it, for I had a great many tender thoughts about me yet, and did nothing but what,as I may say, mere necessity drove me to.

I had a great many adventures after this, but I was young in the business, and did not know how to manage, otherwise than as the devil put things into my head; and indeed he was seldom backward to me. One adventure I had which was very lucky to me; I was going through Lombard Street in the dusk of the evening, just by the end of Three King Court, when on a sudden comes a fellow running by me as swift as lightning, and throws a bundle that was in his hand just behind me, as I stood up against the corner of the house at the turning into the alley. Just as he threw it in, he said, “God bless you, mistress, let it lie there a little,”and away he runs. After him comes two more, and immediately a young fellow without his hat, crying, “Stop thief.” They pursued the two last fellows so close that they were forced to drop what they had got, and one of them was taken into the bargain, the other got off free.

I stood stock still all this while till they came back, dragging the poor fellow they had taken, and lugging the things they had found, extremely well satisfied that they had recovered the booty and taken the thief; and thus they passed by me, for I looked only like one who stood up while the crowd was gone.

Once or twice I asked what was the matter, but the people neglected answering me, and I was not very importunate; but after the crowd was wholly passed, I took my opportunity to turn about and take up what was behind me and walk away. This indeed I did with less disturbance than I had done formerly, for these things I did not steal, but they were stolen to my hand. I got safe to my lodgings with this cargo, which was a piece of fine black lustring silk, and a piece of velvet; the latter was but part of a piece, of about 11 yards; the former was a whole piece of near 50 yards. It seems it was a mercer’s shop that they had rifled. I say rifled, because the goods were so considerable that they had lost; for the goods that they recovered were pretty many, and I believe came to about six or seven several pieces of silk. How they came to get so many I could not tell; but as I had only robbed the thief, I made no scruple at taking these goods, and being very glad of them too.

I had pretty good luck thus far, and I made several adventures more, though with but small purchase, yet with good success, but I went in daily dread that some mischief would befall me, and that I should certainly come to be hanged at last. The impression this made on me was too strong to be slighted, and it kept me from making attempts that for aught I knew might have been very safely performed; but one thing I cannot omit which was a bait to me many a day. I walked frequently out into the villages round the town to see if nothing would fall in my way there; and going by a house near Stepney I saw on the window-board two rings, one a small diamond ring, and the other a plain gold ring, to be sure laid there by some thoughtless lady that had more money than forecast, perhaps only till she washed her hands.

I walked several times by the window to observe if I could see whether there was anybody in the room or no, and I could see nobody, but still I was not sure. It came presently into my thoughts to rap at the glass, as if I wanted to speak with somebody, and if anybody was there they would be sure to come to the window, and then I would tell them to remove those rings, for that I had seen two suspicious fellows take notice of them. This was a ready thought. I rapped once or twice and nobody came, when I thrust hard against the square of glass, and broke it with little noise, and took out the rings and walked away; the diamond ring was worth about £3 and the other about 9s.

I was now at a loss for a market for my goods, and especially for my two pieces of silk. I was very loth to dispose of them for a trifle, as the poor unhappy thieves in the general do, who after they have ventured their lives for perhaps a thing of value, are forced to sell it for a song when they have done; but I was resolved I would not do thus, whatever shift I made;however, I did not well know what course to take. At last I resolved to go to my old governess, and acquaint myself with her again. I had punctually supplied the £5 a year to her for my little boy as long as I was able; but at last was obliged to put a stop to it. However, I had written a letter to her wherein I had told her that my circumstances were reduced, that I had lost my husband, and that I was not able to do it any longer, and begged the poor child might not suffer too much for its mother’s misfortunes.

I now made her a visit, and I found that she drove something of the old trade still, but she was not in such flourishing circumstances as before;for she had been sued by a certain gentleman who had had his daughter stolen from him; and who, it seems she had helped to convey away; and it was very narrowly that she escaped the gallows. The expense also had ravaged her, so that her house was but meanly furnished, and she was not in such repute for her practice as before. However, she stood upon her legs, as they say, and as she was a bustling woman, and had some stock left, she was turned pawnbroker, and lived pretty well.

She received me very civilly, and with her usual obliging manner told me she would not have the less respect for me for my being reduced;that she had taken care my boy was very well looked after though I could not pay for him, and that the woman that had him was easy, so that I needed not to trouble myself about him, till I might be better able to do it effectually.

I told her I had not much money left, but that I had some things that were money’s worth, if she could tell me how I might turn them into money. She asked me what it was I had? I pulled out the string of gold beads, and told her it was one of my husband’s presents to me; then I showed her the two parcels of silk, which I told her I had from Ireland, and brought up to town with me; and the little diamond ring. As to the small parcel of plate and spoons, I had found means to dispose of them myself before; and as for the child-bed linen I had, she offered me to take it herself, believing it to have been my own. She told me that she was turned pawnbroker, and that she would sell those things for me as pawned to her; and so she sent presently for proper agents that bought them, being in her hands, without any scruple, and gave good prices too.

I now began to think this necessary woman might help me a little in my low condition to some business; for I would gladly have turned my hand to any honest employment if I could have got it; but honest business did not come within her reach. If I had been younger, perhaps she might have helped me, but my thoughts were off of that kind of livelihood, as being quite out of the way after fifty, which was my case, and so I told her.

She invited me at last to come and be at her house till I could find something to do, and it should cost me very little, and this I gladly accepted of; and now living a little easier, I entered into some measures to have my little son by my last husband taken off; and this she made easy too, reserving a payment only of £5 a year, if I could pay it. This was such a help to me that for a good while I left off the wicked trade that I had so newly taken up; and gladly I would have got work, but that was very hard to do for one that had no acquaintance.

However, at last I got some quilting work for ladies’ beds, petticoats, and the like; and this I liked very well and worked very hard, and with this I began to live; but the diligent devil who resolved I should continue in his service, continually prompted me to go out and take a walk, that is to say, to see if anything would offer in the old way.

One evening I blindly obeyed his summons, and fetched a long circuit through the streets, but met with no purchase; but not content with that, I went out the next evening too, when going by an alehouse I saw the door of a little room open, next the very street, and on the table a silver tankard, things much in use in public-houses at that time. It seems some company had been drinking there, and the careless boys had forgot to take it away.

I went into the box frankly, and setting the silver tankard on the corner of the bench, I sat down before it, and knocked with my foot. A boy came presently and I bade him fetch me a pint of warm ale, for it was cold weather; the boy run, and I heard him go down the cellar to draw the ale.

While the boy was gone another boy came, and cried, “D’ye call?”

I spoke with a melancholy air, and said, “No, the boy is gone for a pint of ale for me.”

While I sat here I heard the woman in the bar say, “Are they all gone in the Five,” which was the box I sat in; and the boy said, “Yes.”

“Who fetched the tankard away?” says the woman.

“I did,” says another boy, “that’s it,” pointing, it seems to another tankard, which he had fetched from another box by mistake; or else it must be that the rogue forgot that he had not brought it in, which certainly he had not.

I heard all this much to my satisfaction, for I found plainly that the tankard was not missed, and yet they concluded it was fetched away; so I drank my ale, called to pay, and as I went away, I said, “Take care of your plate, child,” meaning a silver pint mug which he brought me to drink in.

The boy said, “Yes, madam, very welcome,” and away I came.

I came home to my governess, and now I thought it was a time to try her, that if I might be put to the necessity of being exposed she might offer me some assistance. When I had been at home some time and had an opportunity of talking to her, I told her I had a secret of the greatest consequence in the world to commit to her if she had respect enough for me to keep it a secret. She told me she had kept one of my secrets faithfully; why should I doubt her keeping another? I told her the strangest thing in the world had befallen me, even without any design; and so told her the whole story of the tankard.

“And have you brought it away with you, my dear?” says she.

“To be sure I have,” says I, and showed it to her. “But what shall I do now?” says I, “must not I carry it again?”

“Carry it again!” says she. “Ay, if you want to go to Newgate.”

“Why,” says I, “they can’t be so base to stop me, when I carry it to them again?”

You don’t know those sort of people, child,” says she, “they’ll not only carry you to Newgate, but hang you too without any regard to the honesty of returning it; or bring in an account of all the other tankards as they have lost for you to pay for.”

“What must I do then?” says I.

“Nay,” says she, “as you have played the cunning part and stole it, you must even keep it, there’s no going back now; besides, child,” says she, “don’t you want it more than they do? I wish you could light of such a bargain once a week.”

This gave me a new notion of my governess, and that since she was turned pawnbroker she had a sort of people about her that were none of the honest ones that I had met there before.

I had not been long there but I discovered it more plainly than before, for every now and then I saw hilts of swords, spoons, forks, tankards, and all such kind of ware brought in, not to be pawned, but to be sold downright; and she bought them all without asking any questions, but had good bargains, as I found by her discourse.

I found also that by following this trade she always melted down the plate she bought, that it might not be challenged; and she came to me and told me one morning that she was going to melt, and if I would, she would put my tankard in that it might not be seen by anybody. I told her, with all my heart; so she weighed it, and allowed me the full value in silver again;but I found she did not do so to the rest of her customers.

Some time after this, as I was at work and very melancholy, she begins to ask me what the matter was? I told her my heart was very heavy, I had little work, and nothing to live on, and knew not what course to take. She laughed and told me I must go out again and try my fortune; it might be that I might meet with another piece of plate.

“O mother,” says I, “that is a trade that I have no skill in, and if I should be taken I am undone at once.”

Says she, “I could help you to a school-mistress that shall make you as dexterous as herself.” I trembled at that proposal, for hitherto I had had no confederates nor any acquaintance among that tribe; but she conquered all my modesty and all my fears; and in a little time, by the help of this confederate, I grew as impudent a thief, and as dexterous, as ever Moll Cut-Purse was, though if fame does not belie her not half so handsome.

The comrade she helped me to dealt in three sorts of craft, viz., shop-lifing, stealing of shop books and pocket books, and taking off gold watches from the ladies’ sides; and this last she did so dexterously that no woman ever arrived to the perfection of that art like her. I liked the first and the last of these things very well, and I attended her some time in the practice, just as a deputy attends a midwife without any pay.

At length she put me to practice. She had shown me her art, and I had several times unhooked a watch from her own side with great dexterity. At last she showed me a prize, and this was a young lady with child who had a charming watch; the thing was to be done as she came out of the church. She goes on one side of the lady, and pretends, just as she came to the steps, to fall, and fell against the lady with so much violence as put her into a great fright, and both cried out terribly. In the very moment that she jostled the lady, I had hold of the watch, and holding it the right way, the start she gave drew the hook out and she never felt it. I made off immediately, and left my school-mistress to come out of her fright gradually, and the lady too; and presently the watch was missed.

“Ay,” says my comrade, “then it was those rogues that thrust me down, I warrant ye. I wonder the gentlewoman did not miss her watch before, then we might have taken them.”

She humoured the thing so well that nobody suspected her, and I was got home a full hour before her. This was my first adventure in company;the watch was indeed a very fine one, and had many trinkets about it, and my governess allowed us £20 for it, of which I had half, and thus I was entered a complete thief, hardened to a pitch above all the reflections of conscience or modesty, and to a degree which I never thought possible in me.

Thus the devil who began, by the help of an irresistible poverty, to push me into this wickedness, brought me on to a height beyond the common rate, even when my necessities were not so terrifying; for I had now got into a little vein of work, and as I was not at a loss to handle my needle, it was very probable I might have got my bread honestly enough.

I must say that if such a prospect of work had presented itself at first when I began to feel the approach of my miserable circumstances; I say, had such a prospect of getting bread by working presented itself then, I had never fallen into this wicked trade or into such a wicked gang as I was now embarked with; but practice had hardened me, and I grew audacious to the last degree; and the more so, because I had carried it on so long, and had never been taken; for, in a word, my new partner in wickedness and I went on together so long without being ever detected, that we not only grew bold, but we grew rich, and we had at one time one-and-twenty gold watches in our hands.

I remember that one day, being a little more serious than ordinary, and finding I had so good a stock beforehand as I had, for I had near £200 in money for my share; it came strongly into my mind, no doubt from some kind spirit, if such there be, that as at first poverty excited me, and my distresses drove me to these dreadful shifts; so seeing those distresses were now relieved, and I could also get something towards a maintenance by working, and had so good a bank to support me, why should I not now leave off, while I was well; that I could not expect to go always free; and if I was once surprised, I was undone.

This was doubtless the happy minute when, if I had hearkened to the blessed hint from whatsoever hand it came, I had still a cast for an easy life; but my fate was otherwise determined, the busy devil that drew me in had too fast hold of me to let me go back; but as poverty brought me in, so avarice kept me in, till there was no going back. As to the arguments which my reason dictated for persuading me to lay down, avarice stepped in and said, “Go on, you have had very good luck, go on till you have gotten four or five hundred pounds, and then you shall leave off, and then you may live easy without working at all.”

Thus I that was once in the Devil’s clutches, was held fast there as with a charm, and had no power to go without the circle, till I was engulfed in labyrinths of trouble too great to get out at all.

However, these thoughts left some impression upon me, and made me act with some more caution than before, and more than my directors used for themselves. My comrade, as I called her—she should have been called my teacher—with another of her scholars was the first in the misfortune; for happening to be upon the hunt for purchase, they made an attempt upon a linen draper in Cheapside, but were snapped by a hawk’s-eyed journeyman, and seized with two pieces of cambric, which were taken also upon them.

This was enough to lodge them both in Newgate, were they had the misfortune to have some of their former sins brought to remembrance;two other indictments being brought against them, and the facts being proved upon them, they were condemned to die. They both pleaded their bellies and were both voted quick with child; though my tutoress was no more with child than I was.

I went frequently to see them and condole with them, expecting that it would be my turn next; but the place gave me so much horror, reflecting that it was the place of my unhappy birth and of my mother’s misfortunes, that I could not bear it, so I left off going to see them.

And oh! could I but have taken warning by their disasters I had been happy still, for I was yet free, and had nothing brought against me; but it could not be, my measure was not yet filled up.

My comrade having the brand of an old offender, was executed; the young offender was spared, having obtained a reprieve, but lay starving a long while in prison, till at last she got her name into what they call a circuit pardon, and so came off.

This terrible example of my comrade frighted me heartily, and for a good while I made no excursions. But one night, in the neighbourhood of my governess’s house, they cried “Fire!” My governess looked out, for we were all up, and cried immediately that such a gentlewoman’s house was all of a light fire a-top; and so indeed it was. Here she gives me a jog,“Now, child,” says she, “there is a rare opportunity, the fire being so near that you may go to it before the street is blocked up with the crowd;” she presently gave me my cue. “Go, child,” she says, “to the house, and run in and tell the lady, or anybody you see, that you come to help them, and that you came from such a gentlewoman” (that is, one of her acquaintance farther up the street).

Away I went, and coming to the house I found them all in confusion, you may be sure. I run in, and finding one of the maids, “Alas! sweetheart,”said I, “how came this dismal accident? Where is your mistress? Is she safe? And where are the children? I come from Madam — to help you.”

Away runs the maid, “Madam, madam,” says she, screaming as loud as she could yell, “here is a gentlewoman come from Madam — to help us,” The poor woman, half out of her wits, with a bundle under her arm, and two little children, comes towards me.

“Madam,” says I, “let me carry the poor children to Madam —; she desires you to send them; she’ll take care of the poor lambs,” and so I takes one of them out of her hand, and she lifts the other up into my arms.

“Ay, do, for God’s sake,” says she, “carry them. O thank her for her kindness.”

“Have you anything else to secure, madam?” says I, “she will take care of it.”

“O dear!” says she, “God bless her, take this bundle of plate and carry it to her too. O she is a good woman. O, we are utterly ruined, undone,” and away she runs from me out of her wits, and the maids after her, and away comes I with the two children and the bundle.

I was no sooner got into the street but I saw another woman come to me. “Oh!” says she, “mistress,” in a piteous tone, “you will let fall the child; come, come, this is a sad time, let me help you,” and immediately lays hold of my bundle to carry it for me.

“No,” says I, “if you will help me, take the child by the hand, and lead it for me but to the upper end of the street. I’ll go with you and satisfy you for your pains.”

She could not avoid going after what I said, but the creature, in short, was one of the same business with me, and wanted nothing but the bundle. However, she went with me to the door, for she could not help it. When we were come there I whispered her, “Go, child,” said I, “I understand your trade, you may meet with purchase enough.”

She understood me and walked off; I thundered at the door with the children, and as the people were raised before by the noise of the fire, I was soon let in, and I said, “Is madam awake? Pray tell her Mrs. —desires the favour of her to take the two children in; poor lady, she will be undone, their house is all of a flame.” They took the children in very civilly, pitied the family in distress, and away came I with my bundle. One of the maids asked me if I was not to leave the bundle too. I said “No, sweetheart, ’tis to go to another place. It does not belong to them.”

I was a great way out of the hurry now, and so I went on, and brought the bundle of plate, which was very considerable, straight home to my old governess. She told me she would not look into it, but bade me go again and look for more.

She gave me the like cue to the gentlewoman of the next house to that which was on fire, and I did my endeavour to go, but by this time the alarm of fire was so great, and so many engines playing and the street so thronged with people, that I could not get near the house, whatever I could do; so I came back again to my governess’s, and taking the bundle up into my chamber I began to examine it. It is with horror that I tell what a treasure I found there; ’tis enough to say that besides most of the family plate, which was considerable, I found a gold chain, an old-fashioned thing, the locket of which was broken, so that I suppose it had not been used some years, but the gold was not the worse for that; also a little box of burying rings, the lady’s wedding ring, and some broken bits of old lockets of gold, a gold watch, and a purse with about £24 value in old pieces of gold coin, and several other things of value.

This was the greatest and the worst prize that ever I was concerned in, for indeed, though, as I have said above, I was hardened now beyond the power of all reflection in other cases, yet it really touched me to the very soul when I looked into this treasure; to think of the poor disconsolate gentlewoman who had lost so much besides; and who would think to be sure that she had saved her plate and best things; how she would be surprised when she would find that she had been deceived, and that the person that took her children and her goods had not come, as was pretended, from the gentlewoman in the next street, but that the children had been put upon her without her own knowledge.

I say, I confess the inhumanity of this action moved me very much, and made me relent exceedingly, and tears stood in my eyes upon that subject. But with all my sense of its being cruel and inhuman, I could never find in my heart to make any restitution: the reflection wore off, and I quickly forgot the circumstances that attended it.

Nor was this all, for though by this job I was become considerably richer than before, yet the resolution I had formerly taken of leaving off this horrid trade when I had gotten a little more did not return; but I must still get more; and the avarice had such success, that I had no more thoughts of coming to a timely alteration of life; though without it I could expect no safety, no tranquillity in the possession of what I had gained; a little more, and a little more, was the case still.

At length yielding to the importunities of my crime, I cast off all remorse, and all the reflections on that head turned to no more than this, that I might perhaps come to have one booty more that might complete all; but though I certainly had that one booty, yet every hit looked towards another, and was so encouraging to me to go on with the trade, that I had no gust to the laying it down.

In this condition, hardened by success, and resolving to go on, I fell into the snare in which I was appointed to meet with my last reward for this kind of life. But even this was not yet, for I met with several successful adventures more in this way.

My governess was for awhile really concerned for this misfortune of my comrade that had been hanged, for she knew enough of my governess to have sent her the same way, and which made her very uneasy; indeed, she was in a very great fright.

It is true that when she was gone and had not told what she knew, my governess was easy as to that point, and perhaps glad she was hanged;for it was in her power to have obtained a pardon at the expense of her friends. But the loss of her, and the sense of her kindness in not making her market of what she knew, moved my governess to mourn very sincerely for her. I comforted her as well as I could, and she in return hardened me to merit more completely the same fate.

However, as I have said, it made me the more wary, and particularly I was very shy of shoplifting, especially among the mercers and drapers, who are a set of fellows that have their eyes very much about them. I made a venture or two among the lace folks, and the milliners, and particularly at one shop where two young women were newly set up, and had not been bred to trade. There I carried off a piece of bone-lace, worth six or seven pounds, and a paper of thread; but this was but once, it was a trick that would not serve again.

It was always reckoned a safe job when we heard of a new shop, and especially when the people were such as were not bred to shops; such may depend upon it, that they will be visited once or twice at their beginning, and they must be very sharp indeed if they can prevent it.

I made another adventure or two after this, but they were but trifles. Nothing considerable offering for a good while, I began to think that I must give over trade in earnest; but my governess, who was not willing to lose me, and expected great things of me, brought me one day into company with a young woman and a fellow that went for her husband, though as it appeared afterwards she was not his wife, but they were partners in the trade they carried on; and in something else too. In short, they robbed together, lay together, were taken together, and at last were hanged together.

I came into a kind of league with these two by the help of my governess, and they carried me out into three or four adventures, where I rather saw them commit some coarse and unhandy robberies, in which nothing but a great stock of impudence on their side, and gross negligence on the people’s side who were robbed, could have made them successful;so I resolved from that time forward to be very cautious how I adventured with them; and indeed when two or three unlucky projects were proposed by them, I declined the offer, and persuaded them against it. One time they particularly proposed robbing a watchmaker of three gold watches, which they had eyed in the daytime, and found the place where he laid them; one of them had so many keys of all kinds, that he made no question to open the place where the watchmaker had laid them; and so we made a kind of appointment; but when I came to look narrowly into the thing, I found they proposed breaking open the house, and this I would not embark in, so they went without me. They did get into the house by main force, and broke up the locked place where the watches were, but found but one of the gold watches, and a silver one, which they took, and got out of the house again very clear; but the family being alarmed, cried out “Thieves,”and the man was pursued and taken; the young woman had got off too, but unhappily was stopped at a distance, and the watches found upon her;and thus I had a second escape, for they were convicted, and both hanged, being old offenders, though but young people; and as I said before that they robbed together, so now they hanged together, and there ended my new partnership.

I began now to be very wary, having so narrowly escaped a scouring, and having such an example before me; but I had a new tempter, who prompted me every day, I mean my governess; and now a prize presented, which as it came by her management, so she expected a good share of the booty; there was a good quantity of Flanders lace lodged in a private house, where she had heard of it; and Flanders lace being prohibited, it was a good booty to any custom-house officer that could come at it. I had a full account from my governess, as well of the quantity as of the very place where it was concealed, so I went to a custom-house officer and told him I had a discovery to make to him, if he would assure me that I should have my due share of the reward. This was so just an offer that nothing could be fairer, so he agreed, and taking a constable, and me with him, we beset the house. As I told him I could go directly to the place, he left it to me, and the hole being very dark, I squeezed myself into it, with a candle in my hand, and so reached the pieces out to him, taking care as I gave him some, so to secure as much about myself as I could conveniently dispose of. There was near £300 worth of lace in the whole; and I secured about £50 worth of it myself. The people of the house were not owners of the lace, but a merchant who had entrusted them with it; so that they were not so surprised as I thought they would be.

I left the officer overjoyed with his prize, and fully satisfied with what he had got, and appointed to meet him at a house of his own directing, where I came after I had disposed of the cargo I had about me, of which he had not the least suspicion. When I came he began to capitulate, believing I did not understand the right I had in the prize, and would fain have put me off with £20, but I let him know that I was not so ignorant as he supposed I was; and yet I was glad too that he offered to bring me to a certainty. I asked £100 and he rose up to £30; I fell to £80 and he rose again to £40; in a word, he offered me £50 and I consented, only demanding a piece of lace, which I thought came to about £8 or £9, as if it had been for my own wear, and he agreed to it, so I got £50 in money paid me that same night, and made an end of the bargain; nor did he ever know who I was, or where to enquire for me; so that if it had been discovered that part of the goods were embezzled, he could have made no challenge upon me for it.

I very punctually divided this spoil with my governess, and I passed with her from this time for a very dexterous manager in the nicest cases. I found that this last was the best and easiest sort of work that was in my way, and I made it my business to enquire out prohibited goods; and after buying some, usually betrayed them. But none of these discoveries amounted to anything considerable, not like that I related just now; but I was cautious of running the great risks which I found others did, and in which they miscarried every day.

The next thing of moment was an attempt at a gentlewoman’s gold watch. It happened in a crowd at a meeting-house, where I was in very great danger of being taken. I had full hold of her watch, but giving a great jostle, as if somebody had thrust me against her, and in the juncture giving the watch a fair pull, I found it would not come, so I let it go that moment, and cried as if I had been killed, that somebody had trod upon my foot, and that there was certainly pickpockets there; for somebody or other had given a pull at my watch, for you are to observe that on these adventures we always went very well dressed, and I had very good clothes on, and a gold watch by my side, as like a lady as other folks.

I had no sooner said so, but the other gentlewoman cried out “A pickpocket” too, for somebody, she said, had tried to pull her watch away.

When I touched her watch I was close to her, but when I cried out I stopped, as it were, short, and the crowd bearing her forward a little, she made a noise too, but it was at some distance from me, so that she did not in the least suspect me, but when she cried out “a pickpocket”, somebody cried out, “Ay, and here has been another, this gentlewoman has been attempted too.”

At that very instant, a little farther in the crowd, and very luckily too, they cried out “A pickpocket” again, and really seized a young fellow in the very fact. This, though unhappy for the wretch, was very opportunely for my case, though I carried it handsomely enough before, but now it was out of doubt, and all the loose part of the crowd ran that way, and the poor boy was delivered up to the rage of the street, which is a cruelty I need not describe, and which, however, they are always glad of, rather than be sent to Newgate, where they lie often a long time, and sometimes they are hanged, and the best they can look for, if they are convicted, is to be transported.

This was a narrow escape to me, and I was so frightened that I ventured no more at gold watches a great while; there were indeed many circumstances in this adventure which assisted to my escape; but the chief was, that the woman whose watch I had pulled at was a fool; that is to say, she was ignorant of the nature of the attempt, which one would have thought she should not have been, seeing she was wise enough to fasten her watch so that it could not be slipped up; but she was in such a fright that she had no thought about her; for she, when she felt the pull, screamed out, and pushed herself forward, and put all the people about her in disorder, but said not a word of her watch, or of a pickpocket, for at least two minutes, which was time enough for me and to spare; for as I had cried out behind her, as I have said, and bore myself back in the crowd as she bore forward, there were several people, at least seven or eight, the throng being still moving on, that were got between me and her in that time, and then I crying out “a pickpocket” rather sooner than she, she might as well be the person suspected as I, and the people were confused in their enquiry; whereas, had she with a presence of mind needful on such an occasion, as soon as she felt the pull, not screamed out as she did, but turned immediately round and seized the next body that was behind her, she had infallibly taken me.

This is a direction not of the kindest sort to the fraternity; but ’tis certainly a key to the clue of a pickpocket’s motions, and whoever can follow it will as certainly catch the thief as he will be sure to miss if he does not.

I had another advantage, which puts this matter out of doubt, and which may be an instruction for posterity in the case of a pickpocket. My good old governess, to give a short touch at her history, though she had left off the trade, was, as I may say, born a pickpocket, and as I understood afterward, had run through all the several degrees of that art, and yet had been taken but once; when she was so grossly detected that she was convicted and ordered to be transported; but being a woman of a rare tongue, and withal having money in her pocket, she found means, the ship putting into Ireland for provisions, to get on shore there, where she practised her old trade some years; when falling into another sort of company she turned midwife and procuress, and played a hundred pranks, which she gave me a little history of, in confidence between us as we grew more intimate; and it was to this wicked creature that I owed all the dexterity I arrived to, in which there were few that ever went beyond me, or that practised so long without any misfortune.

It was after those adventures in Ireland, and when she was pretty well known in that country, that she left Dublin, and came over to England, where the time of her transportation being not expired, she left her former trade, for fear of falling into bad hands again, for then she was sure to have gone to wreck. Here she set up the same trade she had followed in Ireland, in which she soon, by her admirable management, and a good tongue, arrived to the height which I have already described, and indeed began to be rich, though her trade fell again afterwards.

I mention thus much of the history of this woman here, the better to account for the concern she had in the wicked life I was now leading;into all the particulars of which she led me, as it were, by the hand, and gave me such directions, and I so well followed them, that I grew the greatest artist of my time, and worked myself out of every danger with such dexterity that when several more of my comrades run themselves into Newgate, by that time they had been half a year at the trade, I had now practised upwards of five years, and the people at Newgate did not so much as know me; they had heard much of me indeed, and often expected me there; but I always got off, though many times in the extremest danger.

One of the greatest dangers I was now in was that I was too well known among the trade, and some of them whose hatred was owing rather to envy than any injury I had done them, began to be angry that I should always escape when they were always catched and hurried to Newgate. These were they that gave me the name of Moll Flanders: for it was no more of affinity with my real name, or with any of the names I had ever gone by, than black is of kin to white, except that once, as before, I called myself Mrs. Flanders, when I sheltered myself in the Mint; but that these rogues never knew, nor could I ever learn how they came to give me the name, or what the occasion of it was.

I was soon informed that some of these who were gotten fast into Newgate had vowed to impeach me; and as I knew that two or three of them were but too able to do it, I was under a great concern, and kept within doors for a good while; but my governess, who was partner in my success and who now played a sure game, for she had no share in the hazard, I say, my governess was something impatient of my leading such a useless, unprofitable life, as she called it; and she laid a new contrivance for my going abroad, and this was to dress me up in men’s clothes, and so put me into a new kind of practice.

I was tall and personable, but a little too smooth faced for a man;however, as I seldom went abroad but in the night, it did well enough; but it was long before I could behave in my new clothes; it was impossible to be so nimble, so ready, so dextrous at these things in a dress contrary to nature; and as I did everything clumsily, so I had neither the success, or easiness of escape that I had before, and I resolved to leave it off; but that resolution was confirmed soon after by the following accident.

As my governess had disguised me like a man, so she joined me with a man, a young fellow that was nimble enough at his business, and for about three weeks we did very well together. Our principal trade was watching shopkeepers’ compters, and slipping off any kinds of goods we could see carelessly laid anywhere, and we made several good bargains, as we called them, at this work: and as we kept always together, so we grew very intimate, yet he never knew that I was not a man; nay, though I several times went home with him to his lodgings, according as our business directed, and four or five times lay with him all night: but our design lay another way, and it was absolutely necessary to me to conceal my sex from him, as appeared afterwards. The circumstances of our living, coming in late, and having such business to do as required that nobody should be trusted with coming into our lodgings, were such as made it impossible to me to refuse lying whith him, unless I would have owned my sex, and as it was I effectually concealed myself.

But his ill, and my good, fortune, soon put an end to this life, which I must own I was sick of too. We had made several prizes in this new way of business, but the last would have been extraordinary; there was a shop in a certain street which had a warehouse behind it that looked into another street, the house making the corner.

Through the window of the warehouse we saw lying on the compter or show-board which was just before it, five pieces of silks, besides other stuffs; and though it was almost dark, yet the people being busy in the fore shop had not had time to shut up those windows, or else had forgot it.

This the young fellow was so overjoyed with that he could not restrain himself, it lay within his reach, he said, and he swore violently to me that he would have it, if he broke down the house for it. I dissuaded him a little, but saw there was no remedy, so he run rashly upon it, slipped out a square out of the sash window dexterously enough, and got four pieces of the silks, and came with them towards me, but was immediately pursued with a terrible clutter and noise; we were standing together indeed, but I had not taken any of the goods out of his hand, when I said to him hastily, “You are undone!” He ran like lightning, and I too, but the pursuit was hotter after him because he had the goods. He dropped two of the pieces, which stopped them a little, but the crowd increased, and pursued us both. They took him soon after with the other two pieces, and then the rest followed me. I run for it and got into my governess’s house, whither some quick-eyed people followed me so warmly as to fix me there. They did not immediately knock at the door, by which I got time to throw off my disguise, and dress me in my own clothes; besides, when they came there, my governess, who had her tale ready, kept her door shut and called out to them and told them there was no man in there. The people affirmed there did a man come in there, and swore they would break open the door.

My governess, not at all surprised, spoke calmly to them, told them they should very freely come and search her house if they would bring a constable, and let in none but such as the constable would admit, for it was unreasonable to let in a whole crowd. This they could not refuse, though they were a crowd; so a constable was fetched immediately, and she very freely opened the door, the constable kept the door, and the men he appointed searched the house, my governess going with them from room to room. When she came to my room she called to me, and said aloud: “Cousin, pray open the door, here’s some gentlemen that must come and look into your room.”

I had a little girl with me, which was my governess’s grandchild, as she called her; and I bade her open the door, and there sat I at work with a great litter of things about me, as if I had been at work all day, being undressed, with only nightclothes on my head, and a loose morning gown about me. My governess made a kind of excuse for their disturbing me, telling partly the occasion of it, and that she had no remedy but to open the doors to them, and let them satisfy themselves, for all she could say would not satisfy them. I sat still, and bid them search if they pleased, for if there was anybody in the house I was sure they were not in my room; and for the rest of the house I had nothing to say to that, I did not understand what they looked for.

Everyhing looked so innocent and so honest about me that they treated me civiller than I expected, but it was not till they had searched the room to a nicety, even under the bed, and in the bed, and everywhere else where it was possible anything could be hid; When they had done and could find nothing, they asked my pardon, and went down.

When they had thus searched the house from bottom to top, and then from top to bottom, and could find nothing, they appeased the mob pretty well; but they carried my governess before the justice. Two men swore that they saw the man, who they pursued, go into her house. My governess rattled and made a great noise that her house should be insulted, and that she should be used thus for nothing; that if a man did come in, he might go out again presently for aught she knew, for she was ready to make oath that no man had been within her doors all that day as she knew of, which was very true; that it might be, that as she was above stairs, any fellow in a fright might find the door open, and run in for shelter when he was pursued, but that she knew nothing of it; and if it had been so, he certainly went out again, perhaps at the other door, for she had another door into an alley, and so had made his escape.

This was indeed probable enough, and the justice satisfied himself with giving her an oath, that she had not received or admitted any man into her house to conceal him, or protect or hide him from justice. This oath she might justly take, and did so, and she was dismissed.

It is easy to judge what a fright I was in upon this occasion, and it was impossible for my governess ever to bring me to dress in that disguise again; for, as I told her, I should certainly betray myself.

My poor partner in this mischief was now in a bad case, for he was carried away before my Lord Mayor, and by his worship committed to Newgate, and the people that took him were so willing, as well as able, to prosecute him, that they offered themselves to enter into recognisances to appear at the sessions, and pursue the charge against him.

However, he got his indictment deferred, upon promise to discover his accomplices, and particularly the man that was concerned with him in this robbery, and he failed not to do his endeavour, for he gave in my name, who he called Gabriel Spencer, which was the name I went by to him, and here appeared the wisdom of my concealing myself from him, without which I had been undone.

He did all he could to discover this Gabriel Spencer; he described me; he discovered the place where he said I lodged; and in a word, all the particulars that he could of my dwelling; but having concealed the main circumstances of my sex from him, I had a vast advantage, and he could never hear of me; he brought two or three families into trouble by his endeavouring to find me out, but they knew nothing of me, any more than that he had a fellow with him that they had seen, but knew nothing of; and as to my governess, though she was the means of his coming to me, yet it was done at second hand, and he knew nothing of her neither.

This turned to his disadvantage; for having promised discoveries, but not being able to make it good, it was looked upon as trifling, and he was the more fiercely pursued by the shopkeeper.

I was, however, terribly uneasy all this while, and that I might be quite out of the way, I went away from my governess for a while; but not knowing whither to wander, I took a maid-servant with me, and took the stage coach to Dunstable to my old landlord and landlady, where I lived so handsomely with my Lancashire husband. Here I told her a formal story, that I expected my husband every day from Ireland, and that I had sent a letter to him that I would meet him at Dunstable at her house, and that he would certainly land if the wind was fair in a few days; so that I was come to spend a few days with them till he could come, for he would either come post or in the West Chester coach, I knew not which, but which soever it was he would be sure to come to that house to meet me.

My landlady was mighty glad to see me, and my landlord made such a stir with me, that if I had been a princess I could not have been better used, and here I might have been welcome for a month or two if I had thought fit.

But my business was of another nature. I was very uneasy (though so well disguised that it was scarce possible to detect me), lest this fellow should find me out; and though he could not charge me with the robbery, having persuaded him not to venture, and having done nothing of it myself, yet he might have charged me with other things, and have bought his own life at the expense of mine.

This filled me with horrible apprehensions. I had no resource, no friend, no confidant but my old governess, and I knew no remedy but to put my life into her hands; and so I did, for I let her know where to send to me, and had several letters from her while I stayed here, some of them almost scared me out of my wits; but at last she sent me the joyful news that he was hanged, which was the best news to me that I had heard a great while.

I had stayed here five weeks and lived very comfortably indeed (the secret anxiety of my mind excepted), but when I received this letter I looked pleasantly again, and told my landlady that I had received a letter from my spouse in Ireland, that I had the good news of his being very well, but had the bad news that his business would not permit him to come away so soon as he expected, and so I was like to go back again without him.

My landlady complimented me upon the good news, however, that I had heard he was well, “For I have observed, madam,” says she, “you han’t been so pleasant as you used to be; you have been over head and ears in care for him, I dare say,” says the good woman; “’tis easy to be seen there’s an alteration in you for the better,” says she.

“Well, I am sorry the esquire can’t come yet,” says my landlord; “I should have been heartily glad to have seen him. When you have certain news of his coming, you’ll take a step hither again, madam,” says he, “you shall be very welcome whenever you please to come.”

With all these fine compliments we parted, and I came merry enough to London, and found my governess as well pleased as I was; and now she told me she would never recommend any partner to me again, for she always found, she said, that I had the best luck when I ventured by myself; and so indeed I had, for I was seldom in any danger when I was by myself, or if I was, I got out of it with more dexterity than when I was entangled with the dull measures of other people, who had perhaps less forecast and were more impatient than I; for though I had as much courage to venture as any of them, yet I used more caution before I undertook a thing, and had more presence of mind to bring myself off.

I have often wondered even at my own hardiness another way, that when all my companions were surprised and fell so suddenly into the hand of justice, yet I could not all this while enter into one serious resolution to leave off this trade; and especially considering that I was now very far from being poor, that the temptation of necessity, which is the general introduction of all such wickedness, was now removed; that I had near £500 by me in ready money, on which I might have lived very well, if I had thought fit to have retired, but, I say, I had not so much as the least inclination to leave off; no, not so much as I had before, when I had but £200 beforehand, and when I had no such frightful examples before my eyes as these were. From hence ’tis evident that when once we are hardened in crime, no fear can affect us, no example give us any warning.

I had indeed one comrade, whose fate went very near me for a good while, though I wore it off too in time; that case was indeed very unhappy. I had made a prize of a piece of very good damask in a mercer’s shop, and went clear off myself; but had conveyed the piece to this companion of mine when we went out of the shop; and she went one way, I went another. We had not been long out of the shop but the mercer missed the piece of stuff, and sent his messengers, one one way, and one another, and they presently seized her that had the piece, with the damask upon her. As for me, I had very luckily stepped into a house where there was a lace chamber up one pair of stairs, and had the satisfaction, or the terror indeed, of looking out of the window and seeing the poor creature dragged away to the justice, who immediately committed her to Newgate.

I was careful to attempt nothing in the lace chamber, but tumbled their goods pretty much to spend time; then bought a few yards of edging, and paid for it, and came away very sad hearted indeed for the poor woman, who was in tribulation for what I only had stolen.

Here again my old caution stood me in good stead; though I often robbed with these people, yet I never let them know who I was; nor could they ever find out my lodging, though they often endeavoured to watch me to it. They all knew me by the name of Moll Flanders, though even some of them rather believed I was she, than knew me to be so; my name was public among them indeed; but how to find me out they knew not, nor so much as how to guess at my quarters, whether they were at the east end of the town, or the west; and this wariness was my safety upon all these occasions.

I kept close a great while upon the occasion of this woman’s disaster;I knew that if I should do anything that should miscarry, and should be carried to prison, she would be there, and ready to witness against me, and perhaps save her life at my expense. I considered that I began to be very well known by name at the Old Bailey, though they did not know my face; and that if I should fall into their hands, I should be treated as an old offender; and for this reason I was resolved to see what this poor creature’s fate should be before I stirred, though several times in her distress I conveyed money to her for her relief.

At length she came to her trial. She pleaded she did not steal the things; but that one Mrs. Flanders, as she heard her called (for she did not know her), gave the bundle to her after they came out of the shop, and bade her carry it home. They asked her where this Mrs. Flanders was? But she could not produce her, neither could she give the least account of me;and the mercer’s men swearing positively that she was in the shop when the goods were stolen, that they immediately missed them, and pursued her, and found them upon her; thereupon the jury brought her in guilty, but the Court considering that she really was not the person that stole the goods, and that it was very possible she could not find out this Mrs. Flanders, meaning me, though it would save her life, which indeed was true; they allowed her to be transported, which was the utmost favour she could obtain, only that the Court told her, if she could in the meantime produce the said Mrs. Flanders, they would intercede for her pardon, that is to say, if she could find me out, and hang me, she should not be transported. This I took care to make impossible to her, and so she was shipped off in pursuance of her sentence a little while after.

I must repeat it again, that the fate of this poor woman troubled me exceedingly; and I began to be very pensive, knowing that I was really the instrument of her disaster; but my own life, which was so evidently in danger, took off my tenderness; and seeing she was not put to death, I was easy at her transportation, because she was then out of the way of doing me any mischief whatever should happen.

The disaster of this woman was some months before that of the last recited story, and was indeed partly the occasion of my governess proposing to dress me up in men’s clothes, that I might go about unobserved; but I was soon tired of that disguise, as I have said, for it exposed me to too many difficulties.

I was now easy as to all fear of witnesses against me, for all those that had either been concerned with me, or that knew me by the name of Moll Flanders, were either hanged or transported; and if I should have had the misfortune to be taken I might call myself anything else as well as Moll Flanders, and no old sins could be placed to my account. So I began to run a-tick again with the more freedom, and several successful adventures I made, though not such as I had made before.

We had at that time another fire happened not a great way off from the place where my governess lived, and I made an attempt there as before, but as I was not soon enough before the crowd of people came in, and could not get to the house I aimed at, instead of a prize I got a mischief, which had almost put a period to my life and all my wicked doings together; for the fire being very furious, and the people in a great fright in removing their goods, and throwing them out of window; a wench from out of a window threw a feather bed just upon me; It is true, the bed being soft it broke no bones: but as the weight was great, and made greater by the fall, it beat me down, and laid me dead for a while:nor did the people concern themselves much to deliver me from it, or to recover me at all; but I lay like one dead and neglected a good while, till somebody going to remove the bed out of the way, helped me up. It was indeed a wonder the people in the house had not thrown other goods out after it, and which might have fallen upon it, and then I had been inevitably killed; but I was reserved for further afflictions.

This accident however spoiled my market for that time, and I came home to my governess very much hurt and frighted, and it was a good while before she could set me upon my feet again.

It was now a merry time of the year, and Bartholomew Fair was begun. I had never made any walks that way, nor was the fair of much advantage to me; but I took a turn this year into the cloisters, and there I fell into one of the raffling shops. It was a thing of no great consequence to me, but there came a gentleman extremely well dressed, and very rich, and as ’tis frequent to talk to everybody in those shops, he singled me out, and was very particular with me; first he told me he would put in for me to raffle, and did so; and some small matter coming to his lot, he presented it to me; I think it was a feather muff. Then he continued to keep talking to me with a more than common appearance of respect; but still very civil and much like a gentleman.

He held me in talk so long, till at last he drew me out of the raffling place to the shop-door, and then to take a walk in the cloister, still talking of a thousand things cursorily without anything to the purpose. At last he told me that he was charmed with my company, and asked me if I durst trust myself in a coach with him; he told me he was a man of honour, and would not offer anything to me unbecoming him. I seemed to decline it a while, but suffered myself to be importuned a little, and then yielded.

I was at a loss in my thoughts to conclude at first what this gentleman designed; but I found afterward he had had some drink in his head, and that he was not very unwilling to have some more. He carried me to the Spring Garden, at Knightsbridge, where we walked in the gardens, and he treated me very handsomely; but I found he drank freely, he pressed me also to drink, but I declined it.

Hitherto he kept his word with me, and offered me nothing amiss;we came away in the coach again, and he brought me into the streets, and by this time it was near ten o’clock at night, when he stopped the coach at a house, where it seems he was acquainted, and where they made no scruple to show us upstairs into a room with a bed in it; at first I seemed to be unwilling to go up, but after a few words I yielded to that too, being indeed willing to see the end of it, and in hopes to make something of it at last. As for the bed, etc., I was not much concerned about that part.

Here he began to be a little freer with me than he had promised; and I by little and little yielded to everything, so that in a word, he did what he pleased with me; I need say no more. All this while he drank freely too, and about one in the morning we went into the the coach again. The air and the shaking of the coach made the drink get more up in his head, and he grew uneasy, and was for acting over again what he had been doing before; but as I thought my game now secure, I resisted, and brought him to be a little still, which had not lasted five minutes but he fell fast asleep.

I took this opportunity to search him to a nicety. I took a gold watch, with a silk purse of gold, his fine full bottom periwig, and silver-fringed gloves, his sword, and fine snuff-box, and gently opening the coach door, stood ready to jump out while the coach was going on; but the coach stopping in the narrow street beyond Temple Bar to let another coach pass, I got softly out, fastened the door again, and gave my gentleman and the coach the slip together.

This was an adventure indeed unlooked for, and perfectly undesigned by me; though I was not so past the merry part of life as to forget how to behave, when a fop so blinded by his appetite should not know an old woman from a young. I did not indeed look so old as I was by ten or twelve years; yet I was not a young wench of seventeen, and it was easy enough to be distinguished. There is nothing so absurd, so surfeiting, so ridiculous as a man heated by wine in his head, and a wicked gust in his inclination together; he is in the possession of two devils at once, and can no more govern himself by his reason than a mill can grind without water. Vice tramples upon all that was in him that had any good in it; nay, his very sense is blinded by its own rage, and he acts absurdities even in his view; such as drinking more, when he is drunk already; picking up a common woman, without any regard to what she is, or who she is;whether sound or rotten, clean or unclean, whether ugly or handsome, old or young; and so blinded, as not really to distinguish; such a man is worse than lunatic; prompted by his vicious head, he no more knows what he is doing than this wretch of mine knew when I picked his pocket of his watch and his purse of gold.

These are the men of whom Solomon says, “They go like an ox to the slaughter, till a dart strikes through their liver;” an admirable description, by the way, of the foul disease, which is a poisonous deadly contagion mingling with the blood whose centre or fountain is in the liver; from whence, by the swift circulation of the whole mass, that dreadful nauseous plague strikes immediately through his liver, and his spirits are infected, his vitals stabbed through as with a dart.

It is true this poor unguarded wretch was in no danger from me, though I was greatly apprehensive at first what danger I might be in from him; but he was really to be pitied in one respect, that he seemed to be a good sort of a man in himself; a gentleman that had no harm in his design;a man of sense, and of a fine behaviour, a comely, handsome person, a sober and solid countenance, a charming, beautiful face, and everything that could be agreeable; only had unhappily had some drink the night before; had not been in bed, as he told me when we were together; was hot, and his blood fired with wine, and in that condition his reason, as it were asleep, had given him up.

As for me, my business was his money, and what I could make of him, and after that if I could have found out any way to have done it, I would have sent him safe home to his house, and to his family, for ’twas ten to one but he had an honest, virtuous wife, and innocent children, that were anxious for his safety, and would have been glad to have gotten him home, and taken care of him, till he was restored to himself; and then with what shame and regret would he look back upon himself? How would he reproach himself with associating himself with a whore? Picked up in the worst of all holes, the Cloister, among the dirt and filth of the town? How would he be trembling for fear he had got the pox, for fear a dart had struck through his liver, and hate himself every time he looked back upon the madness and brutality of his debauch? How would he, if he had any principles of honour, abhor the thought of giving any ill distemper, if he had it, as for aught he knew he might, to his modest and virtuous wife, and thereby sowing the contagion in the life-blood of his posterity?

Would such gentlemen but consider the contemptible thoughts which the very women they are concerned with, in such cases as these, have of them, it would be a surfeit to them. As I said above, they value not the pleasure, they are raised by no inclination to the man, the passive jade thinks of no pleasure but the money; and when he is as it were drunk in the ecstasies of his wicked pleasure, her hands are in his pockets for what she can find there; and of which he can no more be sensible in the moment of his folly than he can fore-think of it when he goes about it.

I knew a woman that was so dextrous with a fellow, who indeed deserved no better usage, that while he was busy with her another way, conveyed his purse with twenty guineas in it out of his fob pocket, where he had put it for fear of her, and put another purse with guilded counters in it into the room of it. After he had done, he says to her, “Now han’t you picked my pocket?” She jested with him, and told him she supposed he had not much to lose. He put his hand to his fob, and with his fingers felt that his purse was there, which fully satisfied him, and so she brought off the money; and this was a trade with her, she kept a sham gold watch, and a purse of counters in her pocket to be ready on all such occasions; and I doubt not practised it with success.

I came home with this last booty to my governess, and really when I told her the story, it so affected her, that she was hardly able to forbear tears, to think how such a gentleman run a daily risk of being undone, every time a glass of wine got into his head.

But as to the purchase I got and how entirely I stripped him, she told me it pleased her wonderfully. “Nay, child,” says she, “the usage may, for aught I know, do more to reform him, than all the sermons that ever he will hear in his life,” and if the remainder of the story be true, so it did.

I found the next day she was wonderful inquisitive about this gentleman; the description I gave her of him, his dress, his person, his face, all concurred to make her think of a gentleman whose character she knew. She mused a while, and I going on in the particulars, says she. “I lay a hundred pound I know the man.”

“I am sorry if you do,” says I, “for I would not have him exposed on any account in the world; he has had injury enough already, and I would not be instrumental to do him any more.”

“No, no,” says she, “I will do him no injury, but you may let me satisfy my curiosity a little, for if it is he, I warrant you I find it out.”

I was a little startled at that, and I told her with an apparent concern in my face that by the same rule he might find me out, and then I was undone.

She returned warmly, “Why, do you think, I will betray you child? No, no,” says she, “not for all he is worth in the world; I have kept your counsel in worse things than these, sure you may trust me in this.” So I said no more.

She laid her scheme another way, and without acquainting me with it, but she was resolved to find it out; so she goes to a certain friend of hers who was acquainted in the family that she guessed at, and told her she had some extraordinary business with such a gentleman (who, by the way, was no less than a baronet, and of a very good family), and that she knew not how to come to him without somebody to introduce her. Her friend promised her readily to do it, and accordingly goes to the house to see if the gentleman was in town.

The next day she comes to my governess and tells her that Sir — was at home, but that he had met with a disaster and was very ill, and there was no speaking to him.

“What disaster?” says my governess hastily, as if she was surprised at it.

“Why,” says her friend, “he had been at Hampstead to visit a gentleman of his acquaintance, and as he came back again he was set upon and robbed! And having got a little drink too, as they suppose, the rogues abused him, and he is very ill.”

“Robbed!” says my governess, “and what did they take from him?”

“Why,” says her friend, “they took his gold watch, and his gold snuff-box, his fine periwig, and what money he had in his pocket, which was considerable to be sure, for Sir — never goes without a purse of guineas about him.”

“Pshaw!” says my old governess, jeering “I warrant you, he has got drunk now and got a whore, and she has picked his pocket, and so he comes home to his wife and tells her he has been robbed; that’s an old sham, a thousand such tricks are put upon the poor women every day.”

“Fie!” says her friend. “I find you don’t know Sir—. Why, he is as civil a gentleman, there is not a finer man, nor a soberer, modester person in the whole city; he abhors such things. There’s nobody that knows him will think such a thing of him.”

“Well, well,” says my governess, “that’s none of my business; if it was, I warrant I should find there was something of that in it; your modest men in common opinion are sometimes no better than other people, only they keep a better character, or, if you please, are the better hypocrites.”

“No, no,” says her friend. “I can assure you Sir — is no hypocrite. He is really an honest, sober gentleman, and he has certainly been robbed.”

“Nay,” says my governess, “it may be he has, it is no business of mine I tell you; I only want to speak with him. My business is of another nature.”

“But,” says her friend, “let your business be of what nature it will, you cannot see him yet, for he is not fit to be seen, for he is very ill, and bruised very much.”

“Ay,” says my governess, “nay then he has fallen into bad hands to be sure;” and then she asked gravely, “Pray where is he bruised?”

“Why, in his head,” says her friend, “and one of his hands, and his face, for they used him barbarously.”

“Poor gentleman,” says my governess. “I must wait then till he recovers,” and adds, “I hope it will not be long.”

Away she comes to me and tells me this story. “I have found out your fine gentleman, and a fine gentleman he was,” says she, “but mercy on him, he is in a sad pickle now. I wonder what the d—I you have done to him; why you have almost killed him.”

I looked at her with disorder enough. “I killed him!” says I. “you must mistake the person, I am sure I did nothing to him. He was very well when I left him,” said I, “only drunk and fast asleep.”

“I know nothing of that,” says she, “but he is in a sad pickle now,”and so she told me all that her friend had said.

“Well then,” says I, “he fell into bad hands after I left him, for I left him safe enough.”

About ten days after, my governess goes again to her friend, to introduce her to this gentleman; sne had enquired otherways in the meantime, and found that he was about again, so she got leave to speak with him.

She was a woman of an admirable address, and wanted nobody to introduce her; she told her tale much better than I shall be able to tell it for her, for she was mistress of her tongue, as I said already. She told him that she came, though a stranger, with a single design of doing him a service, and he should find she had no other end in it; that as she came purely on so friendly an account, she begged a promise from him, that if he did not accept what she should officiously propose, he would not take it ill that she meddled with what was not her business; she assured him that as what she had to say was a secret that belonged to him only, so whether he accepted her offer or not, it should remain a secret to all the world, unless he exposed it himself; nor should his refusing her service in it, make her so little show her respect, as to do him the least injury, so that he should be entirely at liberty to act as he thought fit.

He looked very shy at first, and said he knew nothing that related to him that required much secrecy; that he had never done any man any wrong, and cared not what anybody might say of him; that it was no part of his character to be unjust to anybody, nor could he imagine in what any man could render him any service; but that if it was as she said, he could not take it ill from anyone that should endeavour to serve him; and so, as it were, left her at liberty either to tell him, or not to tell him, as she thought fit.

She found him so perfectly indifferent that she was almost afraid to enter into the point with him; but however, after some other circumlocutions, she told him, that by a strange and unaccountable accident she came to have a particular knowledge of the late unhappy adventure he had fallen into; and that in such a manner, that there was nobody in the world but herself and him that were acquainted with it, no not the very person that was with him.

He looked a little angrily at first. “What adventure?” said he.

“Why, sir,” said she, “of your being robbed coming from Knightsbr—, Hampstead, sir, I should say,” says she. “Be not surprised, sir,” says she,“that I am able to tell you every step you took that day from the Cloister in Smithfield to the Spring Garden at Knightsbridge, and thence to the — in the Strand, and how you were left asleep in the coach afterwards. I say, let not this surprise you, for, sir, I do not come to make a booty of you. I ask nothing of you, and I assure you the woman that was with you knows nothing who you are, and never shall; and yet perhaps I may serve you farther still, for I did not come barely to let you know that I was informed of these things, as if I wanted a bribe to conceal them; assure yourself, sir,” said she, “that whatever you think fit to do or say to me, it shall be all a secret as it is, as much as if I were in my grave.”

He was astonished at her discourse, and said gravely to her, “Madam, you are a stranger to me, but it is very unfortunate that you should be let into the secret of the worst action of my life, and a thing that I am justly ashamed of, in which the only satisfaction I had was, that I thought it was known only to God and my own conscience.”

“Pray, sir,” says she, “do not reckon the discovery of it to me, to be any part of your misfortune; it was a thing, I believe, you were surprised into, and perhaps the woman used some art to prompt you to it; however, you will never find any just cause,” said she, “to repent that I came to hear of it; nor can your mouth be more silent in it than I have been, and ever shall be.”

“Well,” says he, “but let me do some justice to the woman too;whoever she is, I do assure you she prompted me to nothing, she rather declined me; it was my own folly and madness that brought me into it all, ay, and brought her into it too. I must give her her due so far. As to what she took from me, I could expect no less from her in the condition I was in, and to this hour I know not whether she robbed me or the coachman. If she did it, I forgive her. I think all gentlemen that do so should be used in the same manner; but I am more concerned for some other things than I am for all that she took from me.”

My governess now began to come into the whole matter, and he opened himself freely to her; first, she said to him, in answer to what he had said about me, “I am glad, sir, you are so just to the person that you were with; I assure you she is a gentlewoman, and no woman of the town; and however you prevailed with her as you did, I am sure ’tis not her practice. You run a great venture indeed, sir, but if that be part of your care, you may be perfectly easy, for I do assure you no man has touched her, before you, since her husband; and he has been dead now almost eight years.”

It appeared that this was his grievance, and that he was in a very great fright about it; however, when my governess said this to him, he appeared very well pleased; and said, “Well, madam, to be plain with you, if I was satisfied of that, I should not so much value what I lost; for as to that, the temptation was great, and perhaps she was poor and wanted it.”

“If she had not been poor, sir,” says she, “I assure you she would never have yielded to you; and as her poverty first prevailed with her to let you do as you did, so the same poverty prevailed with her to pay herself at last, when she saw you was in such a condition, that if she had not done it, perhaps the next coachman or chairman might have done it more to your hurt.”

“Well,” says he, “much good may it do her; I say again, all the gentlemen that do so, ought to be used in the same manner, and then they would be cautious of themselves; I have no more concern about it, but on the score which you hinted at before.” Here he entered into some freedoms with her on the subject of what passed between us, which are not so proper for a woman to write, and the great terror that was upon his mind with relation to his wife, for fear she should have received any injury from me, and should communicate it farther; and asked her at last if she could not procure him an opportunity to speak with me. My governess gave him further assurances of my being a woman clear from any such thing, and that he was as entirely safe in that respect as he was with his own lady; but as for seeing me, she said it might be of dangerous consequence; but however, that she would talk with me, and let him know; endeavouring at the same time to persuade him not to desire it, and that it could be of no service to him; seeing she hoped he had no desire to renew the correspondence, and that on my account it was a kind of putting my life in his hands.

He told her he had a great desire to see me, that he would give her any assurances that were in his power, not to take any advantages of me, and that in the first place he would give me a general release from all demands of any kind. She insisted how it might tend to further divulging the secret, and might be injurious to him, entreating him not to press for it, so at length he desisted.

They had some discourse upon the subject of the things he had lost, and he seemed to be very desirous of his gold watch, and told her if she could procure that for him, he would willingly give as much for it as it was worth. She told him she would endeavour to procure it for him and leave the valuing it to himself.

Accordingly the next day she carried the watch, and he gave her 30 guineas for it, which was more than I should have been able to make of it, though it seems it cost much more. He spoke something of his periwig, which it seems cost him three-score guineas, and his snuff-box, and in a few days more she carried them too; which obliged him very much, and he gave her thirty more. The next day I sent him his fine sword and cane gratis, and demanded nothing of him, but had no mind to see him, unless he might be satisfied I knew who he was, which he was not willing to.

Then he entered into a long talk with her of the manner how she came to know all this matter. She formed a long tale of that part; how she had it from one that I had told the whole story to, and that was to help me dispose of the goods; and this confidant brought things to her, she being by profession a pawnbroker; and she hearing of his worship’s disaster, guessed at the thing in general; that having gotten the things into her hands, she had resolved to come and try as she had done. She then gave him repeated assurances that it should never go out of her mouth, and though she knew the woman very well, yet she had not let her know, meaning me, anything of who the person was, which, by the way, was false; but, however, it was not to his damage, for I never opened my mouth of it to anybody.

I had a great many thoughts in my head about my seeing him again, and was often sorry that I had refused it. I was persuaded that if I had seen him, and let him know that I knew him, I should have made some advantage of him, and perhaps have had some maintenance from him; and though it was a life wicked enough, yet it was not so full of danger as this I was engaged in. However, those thoughts wore off, and I declined seeing him again for that time; but my governess saw him often, and he was very kind to her, giving her something almost every time he saw her. One time in particular she found him very merry, and as she thought he had some wine in his head then, and he pressed her again to let him see the woman, that, as he said, had bewitched him so that night; my governess, who was from the beginning for my seeing him, told him, he was so desirous of it, that she could almost yield to it, if she could prevail upon me; adding that if he would please to come to her house in the evening, she would endeavour it, upon his repeated assurances of forgetting what was past.

Accordingly she came to me and told me all the discourse; in short, she soon biassed me to consent in a case which I had some regret in my mind for declining before; so I prepared to see him. I dressed me to all the advantage possible, I assure you, and for the first time used a little art. I say for the first time, for I had never yielded to the baseness of paint before, having always had vanity enough to believe I had no need of it.

At the hour appointed he came; and as she observed before, so it was plain still, that he had been drinking, though very far from what we call being in drink. He appeared exceeding pleased to see me, and entered into a long discourse with me upon the old affair. I begged his pardon very often for my share of it, protested I had not any such design when first I met him, that I had not gone out with him, but that I took him for a very civil gentleman, and that he made me so many promises of offering no uncivility to me.

He alleged the wine he drank, and that he scarce knew what he did, and that if it had not been so, he should never have taken the freedom with me he had done. He protested to me that he never touched any woman but me, since he was married to his wife, and it was a surprise upon him;complimented me upon being so particularly agreeable to him, and the like, and talked so much of that kind, till I found he had talked himself almost into a temper to do the thing again. But I took him up short, I protested I had never suffered any man to touch me since my husband died, which was near eight year. He said he believed it; and added, that madam had intimated as much to him, and that it was his opinion of that part which made him desire to see me again; and since he had once broken in upon his virtue with me, and found no ill consequences, he could be safe in venturing again; and so, in short, he went on to what I expected, and to what will not bear relating.

My old governess had foreseen it, as well as I, and therefore led him into a room which had not a bed in it, and yet had a chamber within it which had a bed, whither we with drew for the rest of the night, and, in short, after some time being together, he went to bed, and lay there all night. I withdrew, but came again undressed before it was day, and lay with him the rest of the time.

Thus you see having committed a crime once is a sad handle to the committing of it again; all the reflections wear off when the temptation renews itself; had I not yielded to see him again, the corrupt desire in him had worn off, and ’tis very probable he had never fallen into it with anybody else, as I really believe he had not done before.

When he went away I told him I hoped he was satisfied he had not been robbed again. He told me he was fully satisfied in that point, and putting his hand in his pocket gave me five guineas, which was the first money I had gained that way for many years.

I had several visits of the like kind from him, but he never came into a settled way of maintenance, which was what I would have been best pleased with. Once, indeed, he asked me how I did to live. I answered him pretty quick, that I assured him I had never taken that course that I took with him; but that, indeed, I worked at my needle, and could just maintain myself, that sometimes it was as much as I was able to do, and I shifted hard enough.

He seemed to reflect upon himself that he should be the first person to lead me into that which he assured me he never intended to do himself;and it touched him a little, he said, that he should be the cause of his own sin, and mine too. He would often make just reflections also upon the crime itself, and upon the particular circumstances of it, with respect to himself; how wine introduced the inclinations, how the devil led him to the place, and found out an object to tempt him, and he made the moral always himself.

When these thoughts were upon him he would go away, and perhaps not come again in a month’s time or longer; but then, as the serious part wore off, the lewd part would wear in, and then he came prepared for the wicked part.Thus we lived for sometime;though he did not keep,as they call it, yet he never failed doing things that were handsome and sufficient to maintain me without working, and, which was better, without following my old trade.

But this affair had its end too; for after about a year I found that he did not come so often as usual, and at last he left it off altogether without any dislike or bidding adieu; and so there was an end of that short scene of life, which added no great store to me, only to make work for repentance.

During this interval I confined myself pretty much at home; at least, being thus provided for, I made no adventures, no not for a quarter of a year after. But then, finding the fund fail, and being loath to spend upon the main stock, I began to think of my old trade, and to look abroad into the street, and my first step was lucky enough.

I had dressed myself up in a very mean habit, for as I had several shapes to appear in, I was now in an ordinary stuff gown, a blue apron and a straw hat; and I placed myself at the door of the Three Cups Inn in St. John’s Street. There were several carriers used the inn, and the stage coaches for Barner, for Totteridge, and other towns that way, stood always in the street in the evening, when they prepared to set out; so that I was ready for anything that offered. The meaning was this: people come frequently with bundles and small parcels to those inns, and call for such carriers or coaches as they want to carry them into the country; and there generally attend women, porter’s wives or daughters, ready to take in such things for the people that employ them.

It happened very oddly that I was standing at the inn gate, and a woman that stood there before, and which was the porter’s wife belonging to the Barnet stage coach, having observed me, asked if I waited for any of the coaches. I told her “Yes, I waited for my mistress, that was coming to go to Barnet.” She asked me who was my mistress, and I told her any madam’s name that came next me; but it seemed I happened upon a name, a family of which name lived at Hadley, near Barnet.

I said no more to her, or she to me, a good while, but by and by, somebody calling her at a door a little way off, she desired me that if anybody called for the Barnet coach I would step and call her at the house, which it seems was an ale-house. I said yes, very readily, and away she went.

She was no sooner gone, but comes a wench and a child, puffing and sweating, and asks for the Barnet coach. I answered presently, “Here.”

“Do you belong to the Barnet coach?” says she.

“Yes, sweetheart,” said I, “what do you want?”

“I want room for two passengers,” says she.

“Where are they, sweetheart?” said I.

“Here’s this girl, pray let her go into the coach,” says she, “and I’ll go and fetch my mistress.”

“Make haste then, sweetheart,” says I, “for we may be full else.”The maid had a great bundle under her arm, so she put the child into the coach; and I said, “You had best put your bundle into the coach too.”

“No,” said she, “I am afraid somebody should slip it away from the child.”

“Give it me, then,” said I.

“Take it then,” says she, “and be sure you take care of it.”

“I’ll answer for it,” said I, “if it were twenty pound value.”

“There, take it then,” says she, and away she goes.

As soon as I got the bundle and the maid was out of sight I goes on towards the ale-house, where the porter’s wife was, so that if I met her, I had then only been going to give her the bundle and to call her to her business, as if I was going away, and could stay no longer; but as I did not meet her I walked away, and turning into Charterhouse Lane, made off through Charterhouse Yard, into Long Lane, then into Bartholomew Close, so into Little Britain, and through the Bluecoat Hospital to Newgate Street.

To prevent being known I pulled off my blue apron, and wrapped the bundle in it, which was made up in a piece of painted calico. I also wrapped up my straw hat in it, and so put the bundle upon my head; and it was very well that I did thus, for coming through the Blue Coat Hospital, who should I meet but the wench that had given me the bundle to hold; it seems she was going with her mistress, who she had been to fetch to the Barnet coaches.

I saw she was in haste and I had no business to stop her; so away she went, and I brought my bundle safe to my governess; there was no money, plate, or jewels in it, but a very good suit of Indian damask, a gown and petticoat, a laced head and ruffles of very good Flanders lace, and some other things, such as I knew very well the value of.

This was not indeed my own invention, but was given me by one that had practised it with success, and my governess liked it extremely;and, indeed, I tried it again several times, though never twice near the same place, for the next time I tried in Whitechapel, just by the corner of Petticoat Lane, where the coaches stand that go out to Stratford and Bow, and that side of the country; and another time at the Flying Horse without Bishopsgate, where the Cheston coaches then lay; and I had always the good luck to come off with some booty.

Another time I placed myself at a warehouse by the water-side, where the coasting vessels from the North come, such as Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Sunderland, and other places; here the warehouse being shut, comes a young fellow with a letter, and he wanted a box and a hamper that was come from Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I asked him if he had the marks of it, so he shows me the letter by virtue of which he was to ask for it, and which gave an account of the contents, the box being full of linen and the hamper full of glassware. I read the letter, and took care to see the name, and the marks, the name of the person that sent the goods, and the name of the person they were sent to; then I bade the messenger come in the morning, for that the warehouse-keeper would not be there any more that night.

Away went I, and wrote a letter from Mr. John Richardson, of Newcastle, to his dear cousin, Jemy Cole, in London, with an account that he had sent by such a vessel (for I remembered all the particulars to a tittle), so many pieces of huckaback linen, and so many ells of Dutch holland, and the like, in a box, and a hamper of flint-glasses from Mr. Henzill’s glass-house; and that the box was marked I. C. No. 1., and the hamper was directed by a label on the cording.

About an hour after I came to the warehouse, found the warehouse-keeper, and had the goods delivered me without any scruple, the value of the linen being about £22.

I could fill up this whole discourse with the variety of such adventures, which daily invention directed to, and which I managed with the utmost dexterity, and always with success.

At length, as when the pitcher come safe home that goes so often to the well, I fell into some broils, which though they could not affect me fatally, yet made me known, which was the worst thing next to being found guilty that could befall me.

I had taken up the disguise of a widow’s dress; it was without any real design in view, but only waiting for anything that might offer, as I often did. It happened that while I was going along a street in Covent Garden there was a great cry of “Stop, thief; stop, thief.” Some artists had, it seems, put a trick upon a shopkeeper, and being pursued, some of them fled one way, and some another; and one of them was, they said, dressed up in widow’s weeds, upon which the mob gathered about me, and some said I was the person, others said no. Immediately came the mercer’s journeyman, and he swore aloud I was the person, and so seized on me. However, when I was brought back by the mob to the mercer’s shop, the master of the house said freely that I was not the woman, and would have let me go immediately, but another fellow said gravely, “Pray stay till Mr.—,” meaning the journeyman, “comes back, for he knows her.” So they kept me near half an hour; they had called a constable, and he stood in the shop as my jailer. In talking with the constable I enquired where he lived, and what trade he was. The man not apprehending in the least what happened afterwards, readily told me his name, and where he lived, and told me as a jest that I might be sure to hear of his name when I came to the Old Bailey.

The servants likewise used me saucily, and had much ado to keep their hands off me; the master indeed was civiller to me than they; but he would not let me go, though he owned I was not in his shop before.

I began to be a little surly with him, and told him I hoped he would not take it ill if I had made myself amends upon him another time, and desired I might send for friends to see me have right done.

“No,” he said, “he could give no such liberty. I might ask it when I came before the justice of peace, and seeing I threatened him, he would take care of me in the meantime, and would lodge me safe in Newgate.”

I told him it was his time now, but it would be mine by and by, and governed my passion as well as I was able. However, I spoke to the constable to call me a porter, which he did, and then I called for pen, ink, and paper, but they would let me have none. I asked the porter his name, and where he lived, and the poor man told it me very willingly. I bade him observe and remember how I was treated there; that he saw I was detained there by force. I told him I should want him in another place, and it should not be the worse for him to speak.

The porter said he would serve me with all his heart. “But, madam,”says he, “let me hear them refuse to let you go, then I may be able to speak the plainer.”

With that I spoke aloud to the master of the shop, and said, “Sir, you know in your own conscience that I am not the person you look for, and that I was not in your shop before, therefore I demand that you detain me here no longer, or tell me the reason of your stopping me.”

The fellow grew surlier upon this than before, and said he would do neither till he thought fit.

“Very well,” said I to the constable and to the porter, “you will be pleased to remember this, gentlemen, another time.”

The porter said, “Yes, madam,” and the constable began not to like it, and would have persuaded the mercer to dismiss him, and let me go, since, as he said, he owned I was not the person.

“Good sir,” says the mercer to him tauntingly, “are you a justice of peace or a constable? I charged you with her. Pray do your duty.”

The constable told him, a little moved, but very handsomely, “I know my duty, and what I am, sir; I doubt you know hardly what you are doing.”

They had some other hard words, and in the meantime the journeymen, impudent and unmanly to the last degree, used me barbarously, and one of them, the same that first seized upon me, pretended he would search me, and began to lay hands on me. I spit in his face, called out to the constable, and bade him take notice of my usage.“And pray, Mr. Constable,” said I, “ask that villain’s name,” pointing to the man.

The constable reproved him decently, told him that he did not know what he did, for he knew that his master acknowledged I was not the person; and, says the constable, “I am afraid your master is bringing himself and me too into trouble, if this gentlewoman comes to prove who she is, and where she was, and it appears that she is not the woman you pretend to.”

“Damn her,” says the fellow again, with an impudent hardened face,“she is the lady, you may depend upon it. I’ll swear she is the same body that was in the shop, and that I gave the pieces of satin that is lost into her own hand. You shall hear more of it when Mr. William and Mr. Anthony,”those were other journeymen, “come back. They will know her again as well as I.”

Just as the insolent rogue was talking thus to the constable, comes back Mr. William and Mr. Anthony, as he called them, and a great rabble with them, bringing along with them the true widow that I was pretended to be; and they came sweating and blowing into the shop, and with a great deal of triumph dragging the poor creature in a most butcherly manner up towards their master, who was in the back shop, and they cried out aloud,“Here’s the widow, sir, we have catched her at last.”

“What do you mean by that,” says the master, “why, we have her already, there she sits, and Mr. — says he can swear this is she.”

The other man who they called Mr. Anthony replied: “Mr. — may say what he will, and swear what he will, but this is the woman, and there’s the remnant of satin she stole. I took it out of her clothes with my own hand.”

I now began to take a better heart, but smiled and said nothing. The master looked pale; the constable turned about and looked at me. “Let ’em alone, Mr. Constable,” said I, “let ’em go on.” The case was plain and could not be denied, so the constable was charged with the right thief, and the mercer told me very civilly he was sorry for the mistake, and hoped I would not take it ill; that they had so many things of this nature put upon them every day, that they could not be blamed for being very sharp in doing themselves justice.

“Not take it ill, sir,” said I; “how can I take it well? If you had dismissed me when your insolent fellow seized on me in the street, and brought me to you; and when you yourself acknowledged I was not the person; I would have put it by, and not have taken it ill, because of the many ill things I believe you have put upon you daily; but your treatment of me since has been insufferable, and especially that of your servant. I must and will have reparation for that.”

Then he began to parley with me, said he would make me any reasonable satisfaction, and would fain have had me told him what it was I expected. I told him I should not be my own judge, the law should decide it for me, and as I was to be carried before a magistrate, I should let him hear there what I had to say. He told me there was no occasion to go before the justice now, I was at liberty to go where I pleased, and calling to the constable, told him he might let me go, for I was discharged.

The constable said calmly to him, “Sir, you asked me just now if I knew whether I was a constable or a justice, and bade me do my duty, and charged me with this gentle-woman as a prisoner; now, sir, I find you do not understand what is my duty, for you make me a justice indeed;but I must tell you it is not in my power. I may keep a prisoner when I am charged with him, but ’tis the law and the magistrate alone that can discharge that prisoner; therefore ’tis a mistake, sir. I must carry her before a justice now, whether you think well of it or not.”

The mercer was very high with the constable at first; but the constable happening to be not a hired officer, but a good, substantial kind of man, I think he was a corn chandler, and a man of good sense, stood to his business, would not discharge me without going to a justice of the peace, and I insisted upon it too.

When the mercer saw that; “Well,” says he to the constable, “you may carry her where you please, I have nothing to say to her.”

“But, sir,” says the constable, “you will go with us, I hope, for ’tis you that charged me with her.”

“No, not I,” says the mercer, “I tell you, I have nothing to say to her.”

“But pray, sir, do,” says the constable, “I desire it of you for your own sake, for the justice can do nothing without you.”

“Prithee, fellow,” says the mercer, “go about your business. I tell you I have nothing to say to the gentlewoman. I charge you, in the king’s name, to dismiss her.”

“Sir,” says the constable, “I find you don’t know what it is to be a constable. I beg of you don’t oblige me to be rude to you.”

“I think I need not, you are rude enough already,” says the mercer.

“No, sir,” says the constable, “I am not rude. You have broken the peace in bringing an honest woman out of the street, when she was about her lawful occasions, confining her in your shop, and ill using her here by your servants; and now can you say I am rude to you? I think I am civil to you in not commanding you in the king’s name to go with me, and charging every man I see that passes your door to aid and assist me in carrying you by force; this you know I have power to do, and yet I forbear it, and once more entreat you to go with me.”

Well, he would not for all this, and gave the constable ill language. However, the constable kept his temper, and would not be provoked; and then I put in and said, “Come, Mr. Constable, let him alone. I shall find ways enough to fetch him before a magistrate, I don’t fear that; but there’s that fellow,” says I, “he was the man that seized on me as I was innocently going along the street, and you are a witness of his violence with me since. Give me leave to charge you with him, and carry him before a justice.”

“Yes, madam,” says the constable, and turning to the fellow, “Come, young gentleman,” says he to the journeyman, “you must go along with us. I hope you are not above the constable’s power, though your master is.”

The fellow looked like a condemned thief, and hung back, then looked at his master, as if he could help him; and he, like a fool, encouraged the fellow to be rude, and he truly resisted the constable, and pushed him back with a good force when he went to lay hold on him, at which the constable knocked him down, and called out for help. Immediately the shop was filled with people, and the constable seized the master and man, and all his servants.

The first ill-consequence of this fray was that the woman, who was really the thief, made off, and got clear away in the crowd; and two others that they had stopped also, whether they were guilty or not, that I can say nothing to.

By this time some of his neighbours having come in, and seeing how things went, had endeavoured to bring the mercer to his senses; and he began to be convinced that he was in the wrong; and so at length we went all very quietly before the justice, with a mob of about 500 people at our heels; and all the way we went I could hear the people ask what was the matter? and others reply and say, “A mercer had stopped a gentlewoman instead of a thief, and had afterwards taken the thief; and now the gentlewoman had taken the mercer, and was carrying him before the justice.” This pleased the people strangely, and made the crowd increase, and they cried out as they went, “Which is the rogue?” “Which is the mercer?” and especially the women. Then when they saw him they cried out, “That’s he, that’s he”; and every now and then came a good jab of dirt at him; and thus we marched a good while, till the mercer thought fit to desire the constable to call a coach to protect himself from the rabble;so we rode the rest of the way, the constable and I, and the mercer and his man.

When we came to the justice, which was an ancient gentleman in Bloomsbury, the constable giving first a summary account of the matter, the justice bade me speak, and tell what I had to say; and first he asked my name, which I was very loath to give, but there was no remedy, so I told him my name was Mary Flanders, that I was a widow, my husband being a sea captain, died on a voyage to Virginia; and some other circumstances I told, which he could never contradict, and that I lodged at present in town, with such a person, naming my governess; but that I was preparing to go over to America, where my husband’s effects lay, and that I was going that day to buy some clothes to put myself into second mourning, but had not yet been in any shop, when that fellow, pointing to the mercer’s journeyman, came rushing upon me with such fury, as very much frighted me, and carried me back to his master’s shop; where, though his master acknowledged I was not the person, yet he would not dismiss me, but charged a constable with me.

Then I proceeded to tell how the journeymen treated me; how they would not suffer me to send for any of my friends; how afterwards they found the real thief, and took the goods they had lost upon her, and all the particulars as before.

Then the constable related his case; his dialogue with the mercer about discharging me, and at last his servant refusing to go with him, when I had charged him with him, and his master encouraging him to do so; and at last his striking the constable, and the like, all as I have told it already.

The justice then heard the mercer and his man; the mercer indeed made a long harangue of the great loss they have daily by the lifters and thieves; that it was easy for them to mistake, and that when he found it he would have dismissed me, etc., as above; as to the journeyman he had very little to say, but that he pretended other of the servants told him that I was really the person.

Upon the whole the justice first of all told me very courteously I was discharged; that he was very sorry that the mercer’s man should in his eager pursuit have so little discretion as to take up an innocent person for a guilty; that if he had not been so unjust as to detain me afterwards, he believed I would have forgiven the first affront; that, however, it was not in his power to award me any reparation, other than by openly reproving them, which he should do; but he supposed I would apply to such methods as the law directed; in the meantime he would bind him over.

But as to the breach of the peace committed by the journeyman, he told me he should give me some satisfaction for that, for he should commit him to Newgate for assaulting the constable and for assaulting of me also.

Accordingly he sent the fellow to Newgate for that assault, and his master gave bail, and so we came away; but I had the satisfaction of seeing the mob wait upon them both, as they came out, hallooing, and throwing stones and dirt at the coaches they rode in, and so I came home.

After this hustle, coming home, and telling my governess the story, she falls a-laughing at me. “Why are you so merry?” says I. “The story has not so much laughing room in it as you imagine; I am sure I have had a great deal of hurry and fright too, with a pack of ugly rogues.”

“Laugh,” says my governess. “I laugh, child, to see what a lucky creature you are; why this job will be the best bargain to you that ever you made in your life if you manage it well: I warrant you, you shall make the mercer pay £500 for damages, besides what you shall get of the journeyman.”

I had other thoughts of the matter than she had; and especially, because I had given in my name to the justice of peace; and I knew that my name was so well known among the people at Hick’s Hall, the Old Bailey, and such places, that if this cause came to be tried openly and my name came to be enquired into, no court would give much damages for the reputation of a person of such a character. However, I was obliged to begin a prosecution in form, and accordingly my governess found me out a very creditable sort of a man to manage it, being an attorney of very good business, and of good reputation, and she was certainly in the right of this; for had she employed a pettifogging hedge solicitor, or a man not known, I should have brought it to but little.

I met this attorney and gave him all the particulars at large, as they are recited above; and he assured me it was a case, as he said that he did not question but that a jury would give very considerable damages; so taking his full instructions, he began the prosecution, and the mercer being arrested, gave bail. A few days after his giving bail he comes with his attorney to my attorney, to let him know that he desired to accommodate the matter, that it was all carried on in the heat of an unhappy passion; that his client, meaning me, had a sharp, provoking tongue, and that I used them ill, gibing at them, and jeering them, even while they believed me to be the very person, and that I had provoked them, and the like.

My attorney managed as well on my side; made them believe I was a widow of fortune, that I was able to do myself justice, and had great friends to stand by me too, who had all made me promise to sue to the utmost, if it cost me a thousand pounds, for that the affronts I had received were insufferable.

However, they brought my attorney to this, that he promised he would not blow the coals, that if I inclined to an accommodation, he would not hinder me, and that he would rather persuade me to peace than to war; for which they told him he should be no loser, all which he told me very honestly, and told me that if they offered him any bribe I should certainly know it; but upon the whole he told me very honestly that if I would take his opinion—he would advise me to make it up with them; for that as they were in a great fright, and were desirous above all things to make it up, and knew that, let it be what it would, they must bear all the costs; he believed they would give me freely more than any jury would give upon a trial. I asked him what he thought they would be brought to. He told me he could not tell as to that, but he would tell me more when I saw him again.

Some time after this they came again to know if he had talked with me. He told them he had, that he found me not so averse to an accommodation as some of my friends were, who resented the disgrace offered me, and set me on; that they blowed the coals in secret, prompting me to revenge, or to do myself justice, as they called it; so that he could not tell what to say to it. He told them he would do his endeavour to persuade me, but he ought to be able to tell me what proposal they made. They pretended they could not make any proposal because it might be made use of against them; and he told them that by the same rule he could not make any offers, for that might be pleaded in abatement of what damages a jury might be inclined to give. However, after some discourse and mutual promises that no advantage should be taken on either side by what was transacted then, or at any other of those meetings, they came to a kind of a treaty; but so remote, and so wide from one another, that nothing could be expected from it; for my attorney demanded £500 and charges, and they offered £50 without charges; so they broke off, and the mercer proposed to have a meeting with me myself; and my attorney agreed to that very readily.

My attorney gave me notice to come to this meeting in good clothes, and with some state, that the mercer might see I was something more than I seemed to be that time they had me. Accordingly I came in a new suit of second mourning, according to what I had said at the justice’s; I set myself out, too, as well as a widow’s dress would admit; my governess also furnished me with a good pearl necklace, that shut in behind with a locket of diamonds, which she had in pawn; and I had a very good gold watch by my side: so that I made a very good figure, and as I stayed till I was sure they were come, I came in a coach to the door, with my maid with me.

When I came into the room the mercer was surprised. He stood up and made his bow, which I took a little notice of, and but a little, and went and sat down where my own attorney had appointed me to sit, for it was his house. After a while the mercer said he did not know me again, and began to make some compliments. I told him I believed he did not know me at first, and that if he had he would have not treated me as he did.

He told me he was very sorry for what had happened, and that it was to testify the willingness he had to make all possible reparation that he had appointed this meeting; that he hoped I would not carry things to extremity, which might be not only too great a loss to him, but might be the ruin of his business and shop, in which case I might have the satisfaction of repaying an injury with an injury ten times greater; but that I would then get nothing, whereas he was willing to do me any justice that was in his power, without putting himself or me to the trouble or charge of a suit of law.

I told him I was glad to hear him talk so much more like a man of sense than he did before; that it was true, acknowledgment in most cases of affronts was counted reparation sufficient; but this had gone too far to be made up so; that I was not revengeful, nor did I seek his ruin, or any man’s else, but that all my friends were unanimous not to let me so far neglect my character as to adjust a thing of this kind without reparation. That to be taken up for a thief was such an indignity as could not be put up, that my character was above being treated so by any that knew me, but because in my condition of a widow I had been careless of myself, I might be taken for such a creature, but that for the particular usage I had from him afterward (and then I repeated all as before) it was so provoking I had scarce patience to repeat it.

He acknowledged all, and was mighty humble indeed; he came up to a hundred pounds and to pay all the law charges, and added, that he would make me a present of a very good suit of clothes. I came down to three hundred pounds, and demanded that I should publish an advertisement of the particulars in the common newspapers.

This was a clause he never could comply with. However, at last he came up, by good management of my attorney, to £150 and a suit of black silk clothes. And there, as it were at my attorney’s request, I complied; he paying my attorney’s bill and charges, and gave us a good supper into the bargain.

When I came to receive the money I brought my governess with me, dressed like an old duchess, and a gentleman very well dressed, who we pretended courted me. But I called him cousin, and the lawyer was only to hint privately to them that this gentleman courted the widow.

He treated us handsomely indeed, and paid the money cheerfully enough; so that it cost him £200 in all, or rather more. At our last meeting, when all was agreed, the case of the journeyman came up, and the mercer begged very hard for him, told me he was a man that had kept a shop of his own, and been in good business, had a wife and several children, and was very poor, that he had nothing to make satisfaction with, but should beg my pardon on his knees. I had no spleen at the saucy rogue, nor were his submissions anything to me, since there was nothing to be got by him;so I thought it was as good to throw that in generously as not, so I told him I did not desire the ruin of any man, and therefore at his request I would forgive the wretch, it was below me to seek any revenge.

When we were at supper he brought the poor fellow in to make his acknowledgment, which he would have done with as much mean humility as his offence was with insulting pride, in which he was an instance of a complete baseness of spirit, imperious, cruel, and relentless when uppermost; abject and low-spirited when down. However, I abated his cringes, told him I forgave him, and desired he might withdraw, as if I did not care for the sight of him, though I had forgiven him.

I was now in good circumstances indeed, if I could have known my time for leaving off, and my governess often said I was the richest of the trade in England, and so I believe I was; for I had £700 by me in money, besides clothes, rings, some plate, and two gold watches, and all of them stolen, for I had innumerable jobs besides these I have mentioned. Oh! had I even now had the grace of repentance, I had still leisure to have looked back upon my follies, and have made some reparation; but the satisfaction I was to make for the public mischiefs I had done was yet left behind; and I could not forbear going abroad again, as I called it now, any more than I could when my extremity really drove me out for bread.

It was not long after the affair with the mercer was made up that I went out in an equipage quite different from any I had ever appeared in before. I dressed myself like a beggar woman, in the coarsest and most despicable rags I could get, and I walked about peering and peeping into every door and window I came near; and indeed I was in such a plight now that I knew as ill how to behave in as ever I did in any. I naturally abhorred dirt and rags; I had been bred up light and cleanly, and could be no other, whatever condition I was in; so that this was the most uneasy disguise to me that ever I put on. I said presently to myself that this would not do, for this was a dress that everybody was shy and afraid of; and I thought everybody looked at me as if they were afraid I should come near them, lest I should take something from them, or afraid to come near me, lest they should get something from me. I wandered about all the evening the first time I went out, and made nothing of it, and came home again wet, draggled, and tired. However, I went out again the next night, and then I met with a little adventure, which had like to have cost me dear. As I was standing near a tavern door there comes a gentleman on horseback, and lights at the door, and wanting to go into the tavern, he calls one of the drawers to hold his horse; he stayed pretty long in the tavern, and the drawer heard his master call, and thought he would be angry with him. Seeing me standing by him, he called to me, “Here, woman,” says he,“hold this horse a while till I go in; if the gentleman comes he’ll give you something.”

“Yes,” says I; and takes the horse, and walks off with him soberly, and carried him to my governess.

This had been a booty to those that had undersood it; but never was poor thief more at a loss to know what to do with anything that was stolen; for when I came home my governess was quite confounded, and what to do with the creature we neither of us knew; to send him to a stable was doing nothing, for it was certain that notice would be given in the Gazette,and the horse described,so that we durst not go to fetch it again.

All the remedy we had for this unlucky adventure was to go and set up the horse at an inn, and send a note by a porter to the tavern, that the gentleman’s horse that was lost at such a time was left at such an inn, and that he might be had there; that the poor woman that held him having led him about the street, not being able to lead him back again, had left him there; we might have waited till the owner had published, and offered a reward, but we did not care to venture the receiving the reward.

So this was a robbery and no robbery, for little was lost by it, and nothing was got by it, and I was quite sick of going out in a beggar’s dress; it did not answer at all, and besides I thought it ominous and threatening.

While I was in this disguise I fell in with a parcel of folks of a worse kind than any I ever sorted with, and I saw a little into their ways too;these were coiners of money, and they made some very good offers to me, as to profit; but the part they would have had me embarked in was the most dangerous; I mean that of the very working of the die, as they call it, which had I been taken had been certain death, and that at a stake, I say, to be burnt to death at a stake; so that though I was to appearance but a beggar, and they promised mountains of gold and silver to me to engage, yet it would not do. ’Tis true, if I had been really a beggar, or had been desperate as when I began, I might perhaps have closed with it, for what care they to die that cannot tell how to live? But at present that was not my condition, at least I was for no such terrible risks as those; besides, the very thoughts of being burnt at a stake struck terror to my very soul, chilled my blood, and gave me the vapours to such a degree as I could not think of it without trembling.

This put an end to my disguise too, for though I did not like the proposal, yet I did not tell them so, but seemed to relish it, and promised to meet again; but I durst see them no more; for if I had seen them, and not complied, though I had declined it with the greatest assurances of secrecy in the world, they would have gone near to have murdered me, to make sure work, and make themselves easy, as they call it; what kind of easiness that is, they may best judge that understand how easy men are that can murder people to prevent danger.

This and horse stealing were things quite out of my way, and I might easily resolve I would have no more to say to them. My business seemed to lie another way, and though it had hazard enough in it too, yet it was more suitable to me, and what had more of art in it, and more chances for a-coming off, if a surprise should happen.

I had several proposals made also to me about that time to come into a gang of housebreakers; but that was a thing I had no mind to venture at neither, any more than I had at the coining trade. I offered to go along with two men and a woman, that made it their business to get into houses by stratagem. I was willing enough to venture, but there were three of them already, and they did not care to part, nor I to have too many in a gang, so I did not close with them, and they paid dear for their next attempt.

But at length I met with a woman that had often told me what adventures she had made, and with success, at the waterside, and I closed with her, and we drove on our business pretty well. One day we came among some Dutch people at St. Catherine’s, where we went on pretence to buy goods that were privately got on shore. I was two or three times in a house where we saw a good quantity of prohibited goods, and my companion once brought away three pieces of Dutch black silk that turned to good account, and I had my share of it; but in all the journeys I made by myself I could not get an opportunity to do anything, so I laid it aside;for I had been there so often that they began to suspect something.

This baulked me a little, and I resolved to push at something or other, for I was not used to come back so often without purchase; so the next day I dressed myself up fine, and took a walk to the other end of the town. I passed through the Exchange in the Strand, but had no notion of finding anything to do there, when on a sudden I saw a great clutter in the place, and all the people, shopkeepers as well as others, standing up and staring, and what should it be but some great duchess come into the exchange? and they said the Queen was coming. I set myself close up to a shopside with my back to the compter, as if to let the crowd pass by, when keeping my eye upon a parcel of lace, which the shopkeeper was showing to some ladies that stood by me; the shopkeeper and her maid were so taken up with looking to see who was a-coming, and what shop they would go to, that I found means to slip a paper of lace into my pocket, and come clear off with it, so the lady milliner paid dear enough for her gaping after the Queen.

I went off from the shop, as if driven along by the throng, and mingling myself with the crowd, went out at the other door of the Exchange, and so got away before they missed their lace; and because I would not be followed, I called a coach and shut myself up in it. I had scarce shut the coach doors, but I saw the milliner’s maid, and five or six more come running out into the street, and crying out as if they were frighted; they did not cry “Stop, thief!” because nobody ran away, but I could hear the word “robbed,” and “lace,” two or three times, and saw the wench wringing her hands, and run staring too, and again, like one scared. The coachman that had taken me up was getting up into the box, but was not quite up, and the horses had not begun to move, so that I was terrible uneasy; and I took the packet of lace and laid it ready to have dropped it out at the flap of the coach, which opens before, just behind the coachman; but to my great satisfaction in less than a minute the coach began to move, that is to say, as soon as the coachman had got up, and spoken to his horses; so he drove away, and I brought off my purchase, which was worth near twenty pound.

The next day I dressed me up again, but in quite different clothes, and walked the same way again, but nothing offered till I came into St. James’s Park. I saw abundance of fine ladies in the Park, walking in the Mall, and among the rest there was a little miss, a young lady of about twelve or thirteen years old, and she had a sister, as I supposed, with her, that might be about nine: I observed the biggest had a fine gold watch on, and a good necklace of pearl, and they had a footman in livery with them; but as it is not usual for the footmen to go behind the ladies in the Mall, so I observed the footman stopped at their going into the Mall, and the biggest of the sisters spoke to him, to bid him be just there when they came back.

When I heard her dismiss the footman I stepped up to him and asked him what little lady that was? and held a little chat with him, about what a pretty child it was with her, and how genteel and well carriaged the eldest would be; how womanish, and how grave; and the fool of a fellow told me presently who she was, that she was Sir Thomas — ’s eldest daughter, of Essex, and that she was a great fortune, that her mother was not come to Town yet; but she was with Sir William—’s lady at her lodgings in Suffolk Street, and a great deal more; that they had a maid and a woman to wait on them, besides Sir Thomas’s coach, the coachman and himself,and that young lady was governess to the whole family, as well here as at home; and told me abundance of things enough for my business.

I was well dressed and had my gold watch as well as she; so I left the footman, and I puts myself in a rank with this lady, having stayed till she had taken one turn in the Mall, and was going forward again. By and by I saluted her by her name, with the title of Lady Betty: I asked her when she heard from her father? when my lady, her mother, would be in Town and how she did?

I talked so familiarly to her of her whole family that she could not suspect but that I knew them all intimately. I asked her why she would come abroad without Mrs. Chime with her (that was the name of her woman) to take care of Mrs. Judith, that was her sister. Then I entered into a long chat with her about her sister, what a fine little lady she was, and asked her if she had learned French, and a thousand such little things, when on a sudden the Guards came, and the crowd run to see the King go by to the Parliament House.

The ladies run all to the side of the Mall, and I helped my lady to stand upon the edge of the boards on the side of the Mall, that she might be high enough to see; and took the little one and lifted her quite up;during which I took care to convey the gold watch so clean away from the Lady Betty that she never missed it till the crowd was gone and she was gotten into the middle of the Mall.

I took my leave in the very crowd, and said, as if in haste, “Dear Lady Betty, take care of your little sister,” and so the crowd did as it were thrust me away, and that I was unwilling to take my leave.

The hurry in such cases is immediately over, and the place clear as soon as the King is gone by; but as there is always a great running and clutter just as the King passes, so having dropped the two little ladies, and done my business with them without any miscarriage, I kept hurrying on among the crowd, as if I run to see the King, and so I kept before the crowd till I came to the end of the Mall; when the King going on toward the Horse Guards, I went forward to the passage, which went then through against the end of the Haymarket, and there I bestowed a coach upon myself, and made off; and I confess I have not yet been so good as my word, viz., to go and visit my Lady Betty.

I was once in the mind to venture staying with Lady Betty till she missed the watch, and so have made a great outcry about it with her, and have got her into her coach, and put myself in the coach with her, and have gone home with her; for she appeared so fond of me, and so perfectly deceived by my so readily talking to her of all her relations and family, that I thought it was very easy to push the thing farther, and to have got at least the necklace of pearl; but when I considered that though the child would not perhaps have suspected me, other people might, and that if I was searched I should be discovered, I thought it was best to go off with what I had got.

I came accidently afterwards to hear that when the young lady missed her watch she made a great outcry in the park, and sent her footman up and down to see if he could find me, she having described me so perfectly that he knew it was the same person that had stood and talked so long with him, and asked him so many questions about them; but I was gone far enough out of their reach before she could come at her footman to tell him the story.

I made another adventure after this, of a nature different from all I had been concerned in yet, and this was at a gaming house near Covent Garden.

I saw several people go in and out; and I stood in the passage a good while with another woman with me, and seeing a gentleman go up that seemed to be of more than ordinary fashion, I said to him, “Sir, pray don’t they give women leave to go up?”

“Yes, madam,” says he, “and to play if they please.”

“I mean so, sir,” said I, and with that, he said he would introduce me if I had a mind.

So I followed him to the door, and he, looking in, “There, madam,”says he, “are the gamesters, if you have a mind to venture.”

I looked in, and said to my comrade aloud, “Here’s nothing but men. I won’t venture;” at which one of the gentlemen cried out, “You need not be afraid, madam, here’s none but fair gamesters. You are very welcome to come and set what you please.”

So I went a little nearer and looked on, and some of them brought me a chair, and I sat down, and see the box and dice go round apace; then I said to my comrade, “The gentlemen play too high for us. Come, let us go.”

The people were all very civil, and one gentleman encouraged me, and said, “Come, madam, if you please to venture. If you dare trust me I’ll answer for it; you shall have nothing put upon you here.”

“No, sir,” said I, smiling, “I hope the gentlemen would not cheat a woman;” but still I declined venturing, though I pulled out a purse with money in it, that they might see I did not want money.

After I had sat awhile, one gentleman said to me, jeering, “Come, madam, I see you are afraid to venture for yourself; I always had good luck with the ladies. You shall set for me, if you won’t set for yourself.”

I told him, “Sir, I should be very loath to lose your money,” though,”I added, “I am pretty lucky too; but the gentlemen play so high, that I dare not venture my own.”

“Well, well,” says he, “there’s ten guineas, madam, set them for me.”So I took the money and set, himself looking on; I run out the guineas by one and two at a time, and then the box coming to the next man to me, my gentleman gave me ten guineas more, and made me set five of them at once, and the gentleman who had the box threw out, so there was five guineas of his money again; he was encouraged at this, and made me take the box, which was a bold venture. However, I held the box so long that I gained him his whole money, and had a handful of guineas in my lap, and which was the better luck, when I threw out, I threw but at one or two of those that had set me, and so went off easy.

When I was come this length I offered the gentleman all the gold, for it was his own; and so would have had him play for himself, pretending that I did not understand the game well enough. He laughed, and said if I had but good luck, it was no matter whether I understood the game or no;but I should not leave off. However, he took out the fifteen guineas that he had put in first, and bade me play with the rest. I would have him to have seen how much I had got, but he said “No, no, don’t tell them. I believe you are very honest, and ’tis bad luck to tell them.” So I played on.

I understood the game well enough, though I pretended I did not, and played cautiously, which was to keep a good stock in my lap, out of which I every now and then conveyed some into my pocket; but in such a manner as I was sure he could not see it.

I played a great while, and had very good luck for him, but the last time I held the box till I had gained near fourscore guineas, but lost above half of it back at the last throw; so I got up, for I was afraid I should lose it all back again, and said to him, “Pray come, sir, now, and take it and play for yourself. I think I have done pretty well for you.” He would have had me played on, but it grew late, and I desired to be excused. When I gave it up to him I told him I hoped he would give me leave to tell it now, that I might see what he had gained, and how lucky I had been for him; when I told them there were threescore and three guineas. “Ay,”says I, “if it had not been for that unlucky throw I had got you a hundred guineas.” So I gave him all the money, but he would not take it till I had put my hand into it and taken some for myself, and bid me please myself. I refused it, and was positive I would not take it myself. If he had a mind to do anything of that kind it should be all his own doings.

The rest of the gentlemen seeing us striving, cried “Give it her all”;but I absolutely refused that; then one of them said, “D—n ye, Jack, half it with her, don’t you know you should be always upon even terms with the ladies.” So, in short, he divided it with me, and I brought away thirty guineas, besides about forty-three which I had stole privately, which I was sorry for, because he was so generous.

Thus I brought home seventy-three guineas, and let my old governess see what good luck I had at play. However it was her advice that I should not venture again, and I took her counsel, for I never went there any more;for I knew as well as she, if the itch of play came in, I might soon lose that, and all the rest of what I had got.

Fortune had smiled upon me to that degree, and I had thriven so much, and my governess too, for she always had a share with me, that really the old gentlewoman began to talk of leaving off while we were well, and being satisfied with what we had got; but, I know not what fate guided me, I was as backward to it now as she was when I proposed it to her before, and so in an ill hour we gave over the thoughts of it for the present, and, in a word, I grew more hardened and audacious than ever, and the success I had, made my name as famous as any thief of my sort ever had been.

I had sometimes taken the liberty to play the same game over again, which is not according to practice, which however succeeded not amiss, but generally I took up new figures, and contrived to appear in new shapes every time I went abroad.

It was now a rumbling time of the year, and the gentlemen being most of them gone out of town, Tunbridge and Epsom and such places were full of people, but the city was thin, and I thought our trade felt it a little, as well as others; so that at the latter end of the year I joined myself with a gang who usually go every year to Stourbridge Fair, and from thence to Bury Fair, in Suffolk. We promised ourselves great things here, but when I came to see how things were I was weary of it presently; for except mere picking of pockets, there was little worth meddling with;neither if a booty had been made was it so easy carrying it off, nor was there such a variety of occasion for business in our way, as in London;all that I made of the whole journey was a gold watch at Bury Fair, and a small parcel of linen at Cambridge, which gave me occasion to take leave of the place. It was an old bite, and I thought might do with a country shopkeeper, though in London it would not.

I bought at a linen draper’s shop, not in the fair, but in the town of Cambridge, as much fine holland and other things as came to about seven pounds; when I had done, I bade them be sent to such an inn, where I had taken up my being the same morning, as if I was to lodge there that night.

I ordered the draper to send them home to me, about such an hour, to the inn where I lay, and I would pay him his money; at the time appointed the draper sends the goods, and I placed one of our gang at the chamber door, and when the inn-keeper’s maid brought the messenger to the door, who was a young fellow, an apprentice, almost a man, she tells him her mistress was asleep, but if he would leave the things and call in about an hour I should be awake, and he might have the money; he left the parcel very readily, and goes his way, and in about half an hour my maid and I walked off, and that very evening I hired a horse, and a man to ride before me, and went to Newmarket, and from thence got my passage in a coach that was not quite full to Bury St. Edmund’s, where, as I told you, I could make but little of my trade, only at a little country opera house. I got a gold watch from a lady’s side, who was not only intolerably merry, but a little fuddled, which made my work much easier.

I made off with this little booty to Ipswich, and from thence to Harwich, where I went into an inn, as if I had newly arrived from Holland, not doubting but I should make some purchase among the foreigners that came on shore there; but I found them generally empty of things of value, except what was in their portmanteaux and Dutch hampers, which were always guarded by footmen. However, I fairly got one of their portmanteaux one evening out of the chamber where the gentleman lay, the footman being fast asleep on the bed, and I suppose very drunk.

The room in which I lodged lay next to the Dutchman’s, and having dragged the heavy thing with much ado out of the chamber into mine, I went out into the street to see if I could find any possibility of carrying it off. I walked about a great while, but could see no probability either of getting out the thing, or of conveying away the goods that were in it, the town being so small and I a perfect stranger in it; so I was returning with a resolution to carry it back again and leave it where I found it; just in that very moment I heard a man make a noise to some people to make haste, for the boat was going to put off, and the tide would be spent. I called the fellow, “What boat is it, friend,” said I, “that you belong to?”

“The Ipswich wherry, madam,” says he.

“When do you go off?” says I.

“This moment, madam,” says he. “Do you want to go thither?”

“Yes,” said I, “if you can stay till I fetch my things.”

“Where are your things, madam?” says he.

“At such an inn,” said I.

“Well, I’ll go with you, madam,” says he, very civilly, “and bring them for you.”

“Come away then,” says I, and takes him with me.

The people of the inn were in a great hurry, the packet-boat from Holland being just come in, and two coaches just come also with passengers from London for another packet-boat that was going off for Holland, which coaches were to go back next day with the passengers that were just landed. In this hurry it was that I came to the bar and paid my reckoning, telling my landlady I had gotten my passage by sea in a wherry.

These wherries are large vessels with good accommodation for carrying passengers from Harwich to London; and though they are called wherries, which is a word used in the Thames for a small boat rowed with one or two men; yet these are vessels able to carry twenty passengers, and ten or fifteen tons of goods, and fitted to bear the sea. All this I had found out by enquiring the night before into the several ways of going to London.

My landlady was very courteous, took my money for the reckoning, but was called away, all the house being in a hurry; so I left her, took the fellow up into my chamber, gave him the trunk, or portmanteau, for it was like a trunk, and wrapped it about with an old apron, and he went directly to his boat with it, and I after him, nobody asking us the least question about it; as for the drunken Dutch footman he was still asleep, and his master with other foreign gentlemen at supper, and very merry below; so I went clean off with it to Ipswich, and going in the night, the people of the house knew nothing, but that I was gone to London by the Harwich wherry, as I had told my landlady.

I was plagued at Ipswich with the custom-house officers, who stopped my trunk, as I called it, and would open and search it. I was willing, I told them, that they should search it, but my husband had the key, and that he was not yet come from Harwich; this I said, that if upon searching it they should find all the things be such as properly belonged to a man rather than a woman, it should not seem strange to them; however, they being positive to open the trunk, I consented to have it broken open, that is to say, to have the lock taken off, which was not difficult.

They found nothing for their turn, for the trunk had been searched before; but they discovered several things much to my satisfaction, as particularly a parcel of money in French pistoles, and some Dutch ducatoons, or rix dollars, and the rest was chiefly two periwigs, wearing linen, razors, wash balls, perfumes and other useful things necessary for a gentleman, which all passed for my husband’s, and so I was quit of them.

It was now very early in the morning, and not light, and I knew not well what course to take; for I made no doubt but I should be pursued in the morning, and perhaps be taken with the things about me; so I resolved upon taking new measures. I went publicly to an inn in the town with my trunk, as I called it, and having taken the substance out, I did not think the lumber of it worth my concern; however, I gave it the landlady of the house with a charge to take care of it, and lay it up safe till I should come again, and away I walked into the street.

When I was got into the town a great way from the inn I met with an ancient woman who had just opened her door, and I fell into chat with her, and asked her a great many wild questions or things all remote to my purpose and design, but in my discourse I found by her how the town was situated, that I was in a street which went out towards Hadley; but that such a street went towards the waterside, such a street went into the heart of the town, and at last, such a street went towards Colchester, and so the London road lay there.

I had soon my ends of this old woman, for I only wanted to know which was the London road, and away I walked as fast as I could; not that I intended to go on foot, either to London or to Colchester, but I wanted to get quietly away from Ipswich.

I walked about two or three miles, and then I met a plain countryman, who was busy about some husbandry work, I did not know what; and I asked him a great many questions first, not much to the purpose; but at last told him I was going for London, and the coach was full, and I could not get a passage, and asked him if he could not tell me where to hire a horse that would carry double, and an honest man to ride before me to Colchester, so that I might get a place there in the coaches.

The honest clown looked earnestly at me, and said nothing for above half a minute; when, scratching his poll, “A horse, say you, and to Colchester to carry double; why, yes, mistress, alack-a-day, you may have horses enough for money.”

“Well, friend,” says I, “that I take for granted. I don’t expect it without money.”

“Why, but, mistress,” says he, “how much are you willing to give?”

“Nay,” says I again, “friend, I don’t know what your rates are in the country here, for I am a stranger; but if you can get one for me, get it as cheap as you can, and I’ll give you somewhat for your pains.”

“Why, that’s honestly said, too,” says the countryman.

“Not so honest neither,” said I, to myself, “if thou knewest all.”

“Why, mistress,” says he, “I have a horse that will carry double, and I don’t much care if I go myself with you, an you like.”

“Will you?” says I. “Well, I believe you are an honest man. If you will, I shall be glad of it, I’ll pay you in reason.”

“Why, look ye, mistress,” says he, “I won’t be out of reason with you. Then if I carry you to Colchester it will be worth five shillings for myself and my horse, for I shall hardly come back tonight.”

In short, I hired the honest man and his horse; but when we came to a town upon the road, I do not remember the name of it, but it stands upon a river, I pretended myself very ill, and I could go no farther that night, but if he would stay there with me, because I was a stranger, I would pay him for himself and his horse with all my heart.

This I did because I knew the Dutch gentlemen and their servants would be upon the road that day, either in the stage coaches or riding post, and I did not know but the drunken fellow, or somebody else that might have seen me at Harwich, might see me again, and I thought that in one day’s stop they would be all gone by.

We lay all that night there, and the next morning it was not very early when I set out, so that it was near ten o’clock by that time I got to Colchester. It was no little pleasure that I saw the town where I had so many pleasant days, and I made many enquiries after the good old friends I had once had there, but could make little out, they were all dead or removed. The young ladies had been all married or gone to London; the old gentleman, and the old lady, that had been my early benefactress, all dead; and which troubled me most, the young gentleman, my first lover, and afterwards my brother-in-law, was dead; but two sons men grown, were left of him, but they too were transplanted to London.

I dismissed my old man here, and stayed incognito for three or four days in Colchester, and then took a passage in a waggon, because I would not venture being seen in the Harwich coaches; but I needed not have used so much caution, for there was nobody in Harwich, but the woman of the house, could have known me; nor was it rational to think that she, considering the hurry she was in, and that she never saw me but once, and that by candle light, should have ever discovered me.

I was now returned to London, and though by the accident of the last adventure I got something considerable, yet I was not fond of any more country rambles; nor should I have ventured abroad again if I had carried the trade on to the end of my days. I gave my governess a history of my travels; she liked the Harwich journey well enough, and in discoursing of these things between ourselves she observed, that a thief being a creature that watches the advantages of other people’s mistakes, ’tis impossible but that to one that is vigilant and industrious many opportunities must happen, and therefore she thought that one so exquisitely keen in the trade as I was would scarce fail of something wherever I went.

On the other hand, every branch of my story, if duly considered, may be useful to honest people, and afford a due caution to people of some sort, or other, to guard against the like surprises, and to have their eyes about them when they have to do with strangers of any kind, for ’tis very seldom that some snare or other is not in their way. The moral indeed of all my history is left to be gathered by the senses and judgment of the reader; I am not qualified to preach to them, let the experience of one creature completely wicked, and completely miserable, be a storehouse of useful warning to those that read.

I am drawing now towards a new variety of life: upon my return, being hardened by a long race of crime, and success unparalleled, I had, as I have said, no thoughts of laying down a trade, which if I was to judge by the example of others, must however end at last in misery and sorrow.

It was on the Christmas Day following, in the evening, that, to finish a long train of wickedness, I went abroad to see what might offer in my way; when, going by a working silversmith’s in Foster Lane I saw a tempting bait indeed, and not to be resisted by one of my occupation;for the shop had nobody in it, and a great deal of loose plate lay in the window, and at the seat of the man, who I suppose worked at one side of the shop.

I went boldly in and was just going to lay my hand upon a piece of plate, and might have done it, and carried it clear off, for any care that the men who belonged to the shop had taken of it; but an officious fellow in a house on the other side of the way, seeing me go in, and that there was nobody in the shop, comes running over the street, and without asking me what I was, or who, seizes upon me, and cries out for the people of the house.

I had not touched anything in the shop, and seeing a glimpse of somebody running over, I had so much presence of mind as to knock very hard with my foot on the floor of the house, and was just calling out too, when the fellow laid hands on me.

However, as I had always most courage when I was in most danger;so when he laid hands on me I stood very high upon it that I came in to buy half a dozen of silver spoons, and to my good fortune it was a silversmith’s that sold plate, as well as worked plate for other shops. The fellow laughed at that part, and put such a value upon the service that he had done his neighbour, that he would have it be that I came not to buy but to steal; and raising a great crowd, I said to the master of the shop, who by this time was fetched home from some neighbouring place, that it was in vain to make a noise, and enter into talk there of the case. The fellow had insisted that I came to steal, and he must prove it, and I desired we might go before a magistrate without any more words; for I began to see I should be too hard for the man that had seized me.

The master and mistress of the shop were really not so violent as the man from t’other side of the way; and the man said, “Mistress, you might come into the shop with a good design for ought I know, but it seemed a dangerous thing for you to come into such a shop as mine is, when you see nobody there, and I cannot do so little justice to my neighbour, who was so kind, as not to acknowledge he had reason on his side; though upon the whole I do not find you attempted to take anything, and I really know not what to do in it.”

I pressed him to go before a magistrate with me, and if anything could be proved on me, that was like a design, I should willingly submit, but if not, I expected reparation.

Just while we were in this debate, and a crowd of people gathered about the door, came by Sir T. B., an Alderman of the City, and justice of the Peace, and the goldsmith, hearing of it, entreated his worship to come in and decide the case.

Give the goldsmith his due, he told his story with a great deal of justice and moderation, and the fellow that had come over and seized upon me told his with as much heat and foolish passion, which did me good still. It came then to my turn to speak, and I told his worship that I was a stranger in Londen, being newly come out of the North, that I lodged in such a place, that I was passing this street, and went into a goldsmith’s shop to buy half a dozen of spoons; by great good luck I had an old silver spoon in my pocket, which I pulled out, and told him I had carried that spoon to match it with half a dozen of new ones, that it might match some I had in the country.

That seeing nobody in the shop I knocked with my foot very hard to make the people hear, and had also called aloud with my voice: ’tis true, there was loose plate in the shop, but that nobody could say I had touched any of it; that a fellow came running into the shop out of the street and laid hands on me in a furious manner, in the very moment while I was calling for the people of the house; that if he had really had a mind to have done his neighbour any service, he should have stood at a distance, and silently watched to see whether I had touched anything or no, and then have taken me in the fact.

“That is very true,” says Mr. Alderman, and turning to the fellow that stopped me, he asked him if it was true that I knocked with my foot?

He said “Yes, I had knocked, but that might be because of his coming.”

“Nay,” says the Alderman, taking him short, “now you contradict yourself, for just now you said she was in the shop with her back to you, and did not see you till you came upon her.” Now it was true that my back was partly to the street, but yet as my business was of a kind that required me to have eyes every way, so I really had a glance of him running over, as I said before, though he did not perceive it.

After a full hearing the Alderman gave it as his opinion that his neighbour was under a mistake, and that I was innocent, and the goldsmith acquiesced in it too, and his wife, and so I was dismissed; but as I was going to depart, Mr. Alderman said, “But hold, madam, if you were designing to buy spoons I hope you will not let my friend here lose his customer by the mistake.”

I readily answered, “No, sir, I’ll buy the spoons still if he can match my odd spoon, which I brought for a pattern.” And the goldsmith showed me some of the very same fashion; so he weighed the spoons, and they came to five-and-thirty shillings, so I pulls out my purse to pay him, in which I had near twenty guineas, for I never went without such a sum about me, whatever might happen, and I found it of use at other times as well as now.

When Mr. Alderman saw my money, he said, “Well, madam, now I am satisfied you were wronged, and it was for this reason that I moved you should buy the spoons, and stayed till you had bought them, for if you had not had the money to pay for them I should have suspected that you did not come into the shop to buy, for the sort of people who come upon those designs that you have been charged with are seldom troubled with much gold in their pockets, as I see you are.”

I smiled, and told his worship that then I owed something of his favour to my money, but I hoped he saw reason also in the justice he had done me before. He said, “Yes, he had, but this had confirmed his opinion, and he was fully satisfied now of my having been injured.” So I came well off from an affair in which I was at the very brink of destruction.

It was but three days after this, that not at all made cautious by my former danger as I used to be, and still pursuing the art which I had so long been employed in, I ventured into a house where I saw the doors open, and furnished myself as I thought verily without being perceived, with two pieces of flowered silks, such as they call brocaded silk, very rich; it was not a mercer’s shop, nor a warehouse of a mercer, but looked like a private dwelling-house, and was, it seems, inhabited by a man that sold goods for a weaver to the mercers, like a broker or factor.

That I may make short of the black part of this story, I was attacked by two wenches that came open-mouthed at me just as I was going out at the door, and one of them pulled me back into the room, while the other shut the door upon me. I would have given them good words, but there was no room for it. Two fiery dragons could not have been more furious;they tore my clothes, bullied and roared as if they would have murdered me; the mistress of the house came next, and then the master, and all outrageous.

I gave the master very good words, told him the door was open, and things were a temptation to me, that I was poor and distressed, and poverty was what many could not resist, and begged him with tears to have pity on me. The mistress of the house was moved with compassion, and inclined to have let me go, and had almost persuaded her husband to it also, but the saucy wenches were run even before they were sent, and had fetched a constable, and then the master said he could not go back, I must go before a justice, and answered his wife that he might come into trouble himself if he should let me go.

The sight of a constable indeed struck me, and I thought I should have sunk into the ground. I fell into faintings, and indeed the people themselves thought I would have died, when the woman argued again for me, and entreated her husband, seeing they had lost nothing, to let me go. I offered him to pay for the two pieces whatever the value was, though I had not got them, and argued that as he had his goods, and had really lost nothing, it would be cruel to pursue me to death and have my blood for the bare attempt of taking them. I put the constable in mind, too, that I had broke no doors, nor carried anything away; and when I came to the justice, and pleaded there that I had neither broken anything to get in, nor carried anything out, the justice was inclined to have released me; but the first saucy jade that stopped me affirming that I was going out with the goods, but that she stopped me and pulled me back, the justice upon that point committed me, and I was carried to Newgate; that horrid place! my very blood chills at the mention of its name; the place where so many of my comrades had been locked up, and from whence they went to the fatal tree, the place where my mother suffered so deeply, where I was brought into the world, and from whence I expected no redemption, but by an infamous death: to conclude, the place that had so long expected me, and which with so much art and success I had so long avoided.

I was now fixed indeed; ’tis impossible to describe the terror of my mind when I was first brought in; and when I looked round upon all the horrors of that dismal place I looked on myself as lost, and that I had nothing to think of but of going out of the world, and that with the utmost infamy. The hellish noise, the roaring, swearing and clamour, the stench and nastiness, and all the dreadful afflicting things that I saw there, joined to make the place seem an emblem of Hell itself, and a kind of an entrance into it.

Now I reproached myself with the many hints I had had-as I have mentioned above-from my own reason, from the sense of my good circumstances, and of the many dangers I had escaped, to leave off while I was well, and how I had withstood them all and hardened my thoughts against all fear. It seemed to me that I was hurried on by an inevitable fate to this day of misery, and that now I was to expiate all my offences at the gallows, that I was now to give satisfaction to justice with my blood, and that I was to come to the last hour of my life and of my wickedness together. These things poured themselves in upon my thoughts in a confused manner, and left me overwhelmed with melancholy and despair.

Then I repented heartily of all my life past, but that repentance yielded me no satisfaction, no peace, no, not in the least, because, as I said to myself, it was repenting after the power of further sinning was taken away. I seemed not to mourn that I had committed such crimes, and for the fact, as it was an offence against God and my neighbour; but that I was to be punished for it; I was a penitent, as I thought, not that I had sinned, but that I was to suffer, and this took away all the comfort of my repentance in my own thoughts.

I got no sleep for several nights or days after I came into that wretched place, and glad I would have been for some time to have died there, though I did not consider dying as it ought to be considered neither;indeed, nothing could be filled with more horror to my imagination than the very place, nothing was more odious to me than the company that was there. Oh, if I had but been sent to any place in the world, and not to Newgate, I should have thought myself happy.

In the next place, how did the hardened wretches that were there before me triumph over me! What! Mrs. Flanders come to Newgate at last? What! Mrs. Mary, Mrs. Molly, and after that plain Moll Flanders? They thought the Devil had helped me, they said, that I had reigned so long. They expected me there many years ago, they said, and was I come at last? Then they flouted me with dejections, welcomed me to the place, wished me joy, bid me have a good heart, not be cast down, things might not be so bad as I feared, and the like; then called for brandy, and drank to me; but put it all up to my score, for they told me I was just come to the college, as they called it, and sure I had money in my pocket, though they had none.

I asked one of this crew how long she had been there? She said, four months. I asked her how the place looked to her when she first came into it. “Just as it did now to me,” says she, “dreadful and frightful, that she thought she was in Hell, and I believe so still,” adds she, “but it is natural to me now. I don’t disturb myself about it.”

“I suppose,” says I, “you are in no danger of what is to follow?”

“Nay,” says she, “you are mistaken there, I am sure, for I am under sentence, only I pleaded my belly, but am no more with child than the judge that tried me, and I expect to be called down next session.”

This calling down is calling down to their former judgment, when a woman has been respited for her belly, but proves not to be with child, or if she has been with child, and has been brought to bed. “Well,” says I, “and are you thus easy?”

“Ay,” says she, “I can’t help myself, what signifies being sad? If I am hanged there’s an end of me,” and away she turned dancing, and sings as she goes, the following piece of Newgate wit:





“If I swing by the string,

I shall hear the bell ring,[1]

And then there’s an end of poor Jenny.”





I mention this because it would be worth the observation of any prisoner who shall hereafter fall into the same misfortune and come to that dreadful place of Newgate; how time, necessity, and conversing with the wretches that are there familiarizes the place to them; how at last they become reconciled to that which at first was the greatest dread upon their spirits in the world, and are as impudently cheerful and merry in their misery as they were when out of it.

I cannot say, as some do, this Devil is not so black as he is painted;for indeed no colours can represent that place to the life; nor any soul conceive aright of it but those who have been sufferers there. But how Hell should become by degrees so natural, and not only tolerable, but even agreeable, is a thing unintelligible but by those who have experienced it as I have.

The same night that I was sent to Newgate I sent the news of it to my old governess, who was surprised at it, you may be sure, and spent the night almost as ill out of Newgate as I did in it.

The next morning she came to see me. She did what she could to comfort me, but she saw that was to no purpose. However, as she said, to sink under the weight was but to increase the weight. She immediately applied herself to all the proper methods to prevent the effects of it, which we feared; and first she found out the two fiery jades that had surprised me; she tampered with them, persuaded them, offered them money, and, in a word, tried all imaginable ways to prevent a prosecution. She offered one of the wenches £100 to go away from her mistress, and not to appear against me; but she was so resolute, that though she was but a servant maid at £3 a year wages or thereabouts, she refused it, and would have refused, as my governess said she believed, if she had offered her £500. Then she attacked the other maid. She was not so hard-hearted as the other, and sometimes seemed inclined to be merciful; but the first wench kept her up, and would not so much as let my governess talk with her, but threatened to have her up for tampering with the evidence.

Then she applied to the master. That is to say, the man whose goods had been stolen, and particularly to his wife, who was inclined at first to have some compassion for me. She found the woman the same still, but the man alleged he was bound to prosecute, and that he should forfeit his recognizance.

My governess offered to finds friends that should get his re-cognizances off of the file, as they call it, and that he should not suffer;but it was not possible to convince him that he could be safe in any way in the world but by appearing against me. So I was to have three witnesses of fact against me, the master and his two maids; that is to say, I was as certain to be cast for my life as I was that I was alive, and I had nothing to do but to think of dying. I had but a sad foundation to build upon for that, as I said before, for all my repentance appeared to me to be only the effect of my fear of death, not a sincere regret for the wicked life that I had lived, and which had brought this misery upon me, or for the offending my Creator, who was now suddenly to be my judge.

I lived many days here under the utmost horror. I had death, as it were, in view, and thought of nothing night or day, but of gibbets and halters, evil spirits and devils; it is not to be expressed how I was harassed between the dreadful apprehensions of death and the terror of my conscience reproaching me with my past horrible life.

The ordinary of Newgate came to me, and talked a little in his way, but all his divinity run upon confessing my crime, as he called it (though he knew not what I was in for), making a full discovery, and the like, without which, he told me, God would never forgive me; and he said so little to the purpose that I had no manner of consolation from him; and then to observe the poor creature preaching confession and repentance to me in the morning, and find him drunk with brandy by noon; this had something in it so shocking that I began to nauseate the man, and his work too by degrees, for the sake of the man; so that I desired him to trouble me no more.

I know not how it was, but by the indefatigable application of my diligent governess I had no bill preferred against me the first sessions: I mean to the grand jury at Guildhall. So I had another month or five weeks before me, and without doubt this ought to have been accepted by me as so much time given me for reflection upon what was past, and preparation for what was to come. I ought to have esteemed it as a space given me for repentance, and have employed it as such; but it was not in me. I was sorry (as before) for being in Newgate, but had few signs of repentance about me.

On the contrary, like the water in the hollows of mountains, which petrifies and turns into stone whatever they are suffered to drop upon; so the continual conversing with such a crew of hell-hounds had the same common operation upon me as upon other people. I degenerated into stone, I turned first stupid and senseless, and then brutish and thoughtless, and at last raving mad as any of them were; in short, I became as naturally pleased and easy with the place as if indeed I had been born there.

It is scarce possible to imagine that our natures should be capable of so much degeneracy, as to make that pleasant and agreeable, that in itself is the most complete misery. Here was a circumstance than I think it is scarce possible to mention a worse; I was as exquisitely miserable as it was possible for anyone to be that had life and health, and money to help them, as I had; I had a weight of guilt upon me enough to sink any creature who had the least power of reflection left, and had any sense upon them of the happiness of this life, or the misery of another; I had at first some remorse indeed, but no repentance; I had now neither remorse or repentance.

I had a crime charged on me, the punishment of which was death; the proof so evident that there was no room for me so much as to plead not guilty; I had the name of an old offender, so that I had nothing to expect but death, neither had I myself any thoughts of escaping, and yet a certain strange lethargy of soul possessed me. I had no trouble, no apprehensions, no sorrow about me, the first surprise was gone. I was, I may well say, I know not how; my senses, my reason, nay, my conscience, were all asleep; my course of life for forty years had been a horrid complication of wickedness; whoredom, adultery, incest, lying, theft, and, in a word everything but murder and treason had been my practice from the age of eighteen or thereabouts, to threescore; and now I was engulfed in the misery of punishment; and had an infamous death at the door, and yet I had no sense of my condition, no thought of Heaven or Hell, at least, that went any farther than a bare flying touch, like the stitch or pain that gives a hint and goes off. I neither had a heart to ask God’s mercy, or indeed to think of it, and in this I think I have given a brief description of the completest misery on earth.

All my terrifying thoughts were past, the horrors of the place become familiar, and I felt no more uneasiness at the noise and clamours of the prison than they did who made that noise; in a word, I was become a mere Newgate-bird, as wicked and as outrageous as any of them; nay, I scarce retained the habit and custom of good breeding and manners, which all along till now run through my conversation; so thorough a degeneracy had possessed me that I was no more the some thing that I had been, than if I had never been otherwise than what I was now.

In the middle of this hardened part of my life I had another sudden surprise, which called me back a little to that thing called sorrow, which, indeeed, I began to be past the sense of before. They told me one night that there was brought into the prison, late the night before, three highwaymen, who had committed a robbery somewhere on Hounslow Heath, I think it was, and were pursued to Uxbridge by the country, and there taken after a gallant resistance, in which many of the country people were wounded, and some killed.

It is not to be wondered that we prisoners were all desirous enough to see these brave, topping gentlemen that were talked up to be such as their fellows had not been known, and especially because it was said they would in the morning be removed into the Press Yard, having given money to the head master of the prison to be allowed the liberty of that better place. So we that were women placed ourselves in the way that we would be sure to see them; but nothing could express the amazement and surprise I was in when the first man that came out I knew to be my Lancashire husband, the same with whom I lived so well at Dunstable, and the same who I afterwards saw at Brickhill, when I was married to my last husband, as has been related.

I was struck dumb at the sight, and knew neither what to say or what to do. He did not know me, and that was all the present relief I had. I quitted my company and retire as much as that dreadful place suffers anybody to retire, and cried vehemently for a great while; dreadful creature that I am, said I, how many poor people have I made miserable? How many desperate wretches have I sent to the Devil? This gentleman’s misfortunes I placed all to my own account. He had told me at Chester he was ruined by that match, and that his fortunes were made desperate on my account; for that thinking I had been a fortune, he was run into debt more than he was able to pay; that he would go into the army, and carry a musket, or buy a horse and take a tour, as he called it; and though I never told him that I was a fortune, and so did not actually deceive him myself, yet I did encourage its having it thought so, and so I was the occasion originally of his mischief.

The surprise of this thing only struck deeper in my thoughts, and gave me stronger reflections than all that had befallen me before. I grieved day and night, and the more, for that they told me he was the captain of the gang, and that he had committed so many robberies, that Hind, or Whitney, or the Golden Farmer were fools to him; that he would surely be hanged if there were no more men left in the country; and that there would be abundance of people come in against him.

I was overwhelmed with grief for him; my own case gave me no disturbance compared to this, and I loaded myself with reproaches on his account. I bewailed my misfortunes, and the ruin he was now come to, at such a rate, that I relished nothing now, as I did before, and the first reflections I made upon the horrid life I had lived began to return upon me, and as these things returned, my abhorrence of the place and of the way of living in it returned also; in a word, I was perfectly changed, and become another body.

While I was under these influences of sorrow for him, came notice to me that the next sessions there would be a bill preferred to the grand jury against me, and that I should be tried for my life. My temper was touched before, the wretched boldness of spirit which I had acquired abated, and conscious guilt began to flow in my mind. In short, I began to think, and to think indeed is one real advance from Hell to Heaven; all that hardened state and temper of soul, which I said so much of before, is but a deprivation of thought; he that is restored to his thinking is restored to himself.

As soon as I began, I say, to think, the first thing that occurred to me broke out thus: Lord! what will become of me? I shall be cast to be sure, and there is nothing beyond that but death! I have no friends. What shall I do? I shall be certainly cast! Lord! have mercy upon me! What will become of me? This was a sad thought, you will say, to be the first (after so long time) that had started in my soul of that kind, and yet, even this was nothing but fright at what was to come; there was not a word of sincere repentance in it all. However, I was dreadfully dejected and disconsolate to the last degree; and as I had no friend to communicate my distressed thoughts to, it lay so heavily upon me, that it threw me into fits and swoonings several times a day. I sent for my old governess, and she, give her her due, acted the part of a true friend. She left no stone unturned to prevent the grand jury finding the bill; she went to several of the jury men, talked with them, and endeavoured to possess them with favourable dispositions, on account that nothing was taken away and no house broken, etc., but all would not do; the two wenches swore home to the fact, and the jury found the bill for robbery and house-breaking, that is, for felony and burglary.

I sunk down when they brought the news of it, and after I came to myself I thought I should have died with the weight of it. My governess acted a true mother to me, she pitied me, she cried with me, and for me; but she could not help me; and to add to the terror of it, ’twas the discourse all over the house that I should die for it; I could hear them talk it among themselves very often; and see them shake their heads and say they were sorry for it, and the like, as is usual in the place; but still nobody came to tell me their thoughts, till at last one of the keepers came to me privately, and said, with a sigh, “Well, Mrs. Flanders, you will be tried a Friday” (this was but a Wednesday), “what do you intend to do?”

I turned as white as a clout, and said, “God knows what I shall do, for my part I know not what to do.”

“Why,” says he, “I won’t flatter you, I would have you prepare for death, for I doubt you will be cast; and as you are an old offender, I doubt you will find but little mercy. They say,” added he, “your case is very plain, and that the witnesses swear so home against you, there will be no standing it.”

This was a stab into the very vitals of one under such a burthen, and I could not speak a word, good or bad, for a great while. At last I burst out into tears, and said to him, “Oh, sir, what must I do?”

“Do,” says he, “send for a minister, and talk with him, for, indeed, Mrs. Flanders, unless you have very good friends, you are no woman for this world.”

This was plain dealing indeed, but it was very harsh to me, at least I thought it so. He left me in the greatest confusion imaginable, and all that night I lay awake; and now I began to say my prayers, which I had scarce done before since my last husband’s death, or from a little while after; and truly I may well call it, saying my prayers; for I was in such a confusion, and had such horror upon my mind, that though I cried, and repeated several times the ordinary expression of “Lord, have mercy upon me”; I never brought myself to any sense of being a miserable sinner, as indeed I was, and of confessing my sins to God, and begging pardon for the sake of Jesus Christ; I was overwhelmed with the sense of my condition, being tried for my life, and being sure to be executed, and on this account I cried out all night, “Lord! what will become of me? Lord! what shall I do? Lord, have mercy upon me,” and the like.

My poor afflicted governess was now as much concerned as I, and a great deal more truly penitent; though she had no prospect of being brought to a sentence, not but that she deserved it as much as I, and so she said herself; but she had not done anything for years, other than receiving what I and others had stolen, and encouraging us to steal it. But she cried and took on, like a distracted body, wringing her hands and crying out that she was undone, that she believed there was a curse from heaven upon her, that she should be damned, that she had been the destruction of all her friends, that she brought such a one, and such a one, and such a one to the gallows; and there she reckoned up ten or eleven people, some of which I have given an account of, that came to untimely ends, and that now she was the occasion of my ruin, for she had persuaded me to go on, when I would have left off. I interrupted her there: “No, mother, no,” said I, “don’t speak of that, for you would have had me left off when I got the mercer’s money again, and when I came home from Harwich, and I would not hearken to you, therefore you have not been to blame, it is I only have ruined myself. I have brought myself to this misery;” and thus we spent many hours together.

Well, there was no remedy, the prosecution went on, and on the Thursday I was carried down to the sessions’ House, where I was arraigned, as they called it, and the next day I was appointed to be tried. At the arraignment I pleaded not guilty, and well I might, for I was indicted for felony and burglary; that is, for feloniously stealing two pieces of brocaded silk, value £46, the goods of Anthony Johnson, and for breaking open the doors; whereas I knew very well they could not pretend I had broken up the doors, or so much as lifted up a latch.

On the Friday I was brought to my trial, I had exhausted my spirits with crying for two or three days before, that I slept better the Thursday night than I expected, and had more courage for my trial than I thought possible for me to have.

When the trial began and the indictment was read, I would have spoke, but they told me the witnesses must be heard first, and then I should have time to be heard. The witnesses were the two wenches, a couple of hard-mouthed jades indeed, for though the thing was truth in the main, yet they aggravated it to the utmost extremity, and swore I had the goods wholly in my possession, that I had hid them among my clothes, that I was going off with them, that I had one foot over the threshold when they discovered themselves, and then I put t’other over, so that I was quite out of the house in the street with the goods before they took me, and then they seized me and took the goods upon me. The fact, in general, was true, but I insisted upon it that they stopped me before I had set my foot clear of the threshold: but that did not argue much, for I had taken the goods, and was bringing them away if I had not been taken.

I pleaded that I had stole nothing, they had lost nothing, that the door was open and I went in with design to buy. If, seeing nobody in the house, I had taken any of them up in my hand, it could not be concluded that I intended to steal them, for that I never carried them farther than the door to look on them with the better light.

The Court would not allow that by any means, and made a kind of jest of my intending to buy the goods, that being no shop for the selling of anything, and as to carrying them to the door to look at them, the maids made their impudent mocks upon that, and spent their wit upon it very much; told the Court I had looked at them sufficiently, and approved them very well, for I had packed them up and was a-going with them.

In short, I was found guilty of felony, but acquitted of the burglary, which was but small comfort to me, the first bringing me to a sentence of death, and the last would have done no more. The next day I was carried down to receive the dreadful sentence, and when they came to ask me what I had to say why sentence should not pass, I stood mute a while, but somebody prompted me aloud to speak to the judges, for that they could represent things favourably for me. This encouraged me, and I told them I had nothing to say to stop the sentence; but that I had much to say, to bespeak the mercy of the Court, that I hoped they would allow something in such a case, for the circumstances of it, that I had broken no doors, had carried nothing off, that nobody had lost anything; that the person whose goods they were was pleased to say he desired mercy might be shown, which indeed he very honestly did; that at the worst it was the first offence, and that I had never been before any Court of Justice before; and,in a word, I spoke with more courage than I thought I could have done, and in such moving tone, and though with tears (yet not so many tears as to obstruct my speech), that I could see it moved others to tears that heard me.

The judges sat grave and mute, gave me an easy hearing, and time to say all that I would, but saying neither yes or no to it, pronounced the sentence of death upon me; a sentence to me like death itself, which confounded me. I had no more spirit left in me, I had no tongue to speak, or eyes to look up either to God or man.

My poor governess was utterly disconsolate, and she that was my comforter before, wanted comfort now herself, and sometimes mourning, sometimes raging, was as much out of herself as any mad woman in Bedlam. Nor was she only disconsolate as to me, but she was struck with horror at the sense of her own wicked life, and began to look back upon it with a taste quite different from mine; for she was penitent to the highest degree for her sins, as well as sorrowful for the misfortune. She sent for a minister too, a serious, pious, good man, and applied herself with such earnestness by his assistance to the work of a sincere repentance, that I believe, and so did the minister too, that she was a true penitent, and which is still more, she was not only so for the occasion, and at that juncture, but she continued so, as I was informed, to the day of her death.

It is rather to be thought of than expressed, what was now my condition. I had nothing before me but death; and as I had no friends to assist me, I expected nothing but to find my name in the dead warrant, which was to come for the execution next Friday, of five more and myself.

In the meantime my poor distressed governess sent me a minister, who at her request came to visit me. He exhorted me seriously to repent of all my sins, and to dally no longer with my soul; not flattering myself with hopes of life, which, he said, he was informed there was no room to expect, but unfeignedly to look up to God with my whole soul, and to cry for pardon in the name of Jesus Christ. He backed his discourses with proper quotations of Scripture, encouraging the greatest sinners to repent and turn from their evil way, and when he had done, he kneeled down and prayed with me.

It was now that for the first time I felt any real signs of repentance. I now began to look back upon my past life with abhorrence, and having a kind of view into the other side of time, the things of life, as I believe they do with everybody at such a time, began to look with a different aspect, and quite another shape, than they did before. The views of felicity, the joy, the griefs of life were quite other things; and I had nothing in my thoughts but was so infinitely superior to what I had known in life, that it appeared to be the greatest stupidity to lay a weight upon anything, though the most valuable, in this world.

The word eternity represented itself with all its incomprehensible additions, and I had such extended notions of it, that I know not how to express them. Among the rest, how absurd did every pleasant thing look! I mean, that we had counted pleasant before; when I reflected that these sordid trifles were the things for which we forfeited eternal felicity.

With these reflections came in of mere course severe reproaches for my wretched behaviour in my past life; that I had forfeited all hope of happiness in the eternity that I was just going to enter into; and on the contrary, was entitled to all that was miserable; and all this with the frightful addition of its being also eternal.

I am not capable of reading lectures of instruction to anybody, but I relate this in the very manner in which things then appeared to me, as far as I am able; but infinitely short of the lively impression which they made on my soul at that time; indeed; those impressions are not to be explained by words, or if they are, I am not mistress of words to express them. It must be the work of every sober reader to make just reflections, as their own circumstances may direct; and this is what every one at some time or other may feel something of; I mean, a clearer sight into things to come than they had here, and a dark view of their own concern in them.

But I go back to my own case. The minister pressed me to tell him, as far as I thought convenient, in what state I found myself as to the sight I had of things beyond life; he told me he did not come as ordinary of the place, whose business it is to extort confessions from prisoners, for the farther detecting of other offenders; that his business was to move me to such freedom of discourse as might serve to disburthen my own mind, and furnish him to administer comfort to me as far as was in his power;assured me that whatever I said to him should remain with him, and be as much a secret as if it was known only to God and myself; and that he desired to know nothing of me, but to qualify him to give proper advice to me, and to pray to God for me.

This honest friendly way of treating me unlocked all the sluices of my passions. He broke into my very soul by it; and I unravelled all the wickedness of my life to him. In a word, I gave him an abridgment of this whole history; I gave him the picture of my conduct for fifty years in miniature.

I hid nothing from him, and he in return exhorted me to a sincere repentance, explained to me what he meant by repentance, and then drew out such a scheme of infinite mercy, proclaimed from Heaven to sinners of the greatest magnitude, that he left me nothing to say, that looked like despair or doubting of being accepted, and in this condition he left me the first night.

He visited me again the next morning, and went on with his method of explaining the terms of divine mercy, which according to him consisted of nothing more difficult than that of being sincerely desirous of it, and willing to accept it; only a sincere regret for and hatred of those things which rendered me so just an object of divine vengeance. I am not able to repeat the excellent discourses of this extraordinary man; all that I am able to do is to say that he revived my heart, and brought me into such a condition that I never knew anything of in my life before. I was covered with shame and tears for things past, and yet had at the same time a secret surprising joy at the prospect of being a true penitent, and obtaining the comfort of a penitent, I mean the hope of being forgiven; and so swift did thoughts circulate, and so high did the impressions they had made upon me run, that I thought I could freely have gone out that minute to execution without any uneasiness at all, casting my soul entirely into the arms of infinite mercy as a penitent.

The good gentleman was so moved with a view of the influence which he saw these things had on me, that he blessed God he had come to visit me, and resolved not to leave till the last moment.

It was no less than twelve days after our receiving sentance before any were ordered for execution, and then the dead warrant, as they call it, came down, and I found my name was among them; a terrible blow this was to my new resolutions; indeed, my heart sunk within me, and I swooned away twice, one after another, but spoke not a word. The good minister was sorely afflicted for me, and did what he could do to comfort me with the same arguments, and the same moving eloquence that he did before, and left me not that evening so long as the prison-keepers would suffer him to stay in the prison, unless he would be locked up with me all night, which he was not willing to be.

I wondered much that I did not see him all the next day, it being but the day before the time appointed for execution; and I was greatly discouraged and dejected, and indeed almost sank for want of that comfort which he had so often, and with such success, yielded me in his former visits. I waited with great impatience, till about four o’clock, when he came to my apartment; for I had obtained the favour by the help of money, nothing being to be done in that place without it, not to be kept in the condemned hole, among the rest of the prisoners who were to die, but to have a little dirty chamber to myself.

My heart leapt within me for joy when I heard his voice at the door, even before I saw him; but let anyone judge what kind of motion I found in my soul when, after having made a short excuse for his not coming, he showed me that his time had been employed on my account; that he had obtained a favourable report from the recorder in my case, and, in short, that he had brought me a reprieve.

He used all the caution that he was able in letting me know what it would have been double cruelty to have concealed; for as grief had overset me before, so joy overset me now, and I fell into a more dangerous swooning than at first, and it was not without difficulty that I was recovered at all.

The good man having made a very Christian exhortation to me, not to let the joy of my reprieve put the remembrance of my past sorrow out of my mind, and told me that he must leave me to go and enter the reprieve in the books, and show it to the sheriffs, he stood up just before his going away, and in a very earnest manner prayed to God for me, that my repentance might be made unfeigned and sincere; and that my coming back, as it were, into life again might not be a returning to the follies of life, which I had made such solemn resolutions to forsake. I joined heartily in that petition, and must needs say I had deeper impressions upon my mind all that night, of the mercy of God in sparing my life, and a greater detestation of my sins from a sense of that goodness, than I had in all my sorrow before.

This may be thought inconsistent in itself, and wide from the business of this book. Particularly, I reflect that many of those who may be pleased and diverted with the relation of the wicked part of my story may not relish this, which is really the best part of my life, the most advantageous to myself, and the most instructive to others; such, however, will I hope allow me liberty to make my story complete. It would be a severe satire on such, to say they do not relish the repentance as much as they do the crime; and they had rather the history were a complete tragedy, as it was very likely to have been.

But I go on with my relation. The next morning there was a sad scene indeed in the prison; the first thing I was saluted with in the morning was the tolling of the great bell at St Sepulchre’s which ushered in the day. As soon as it began to toll, a dismal groaning and crying was heard from the condemned hole, where there lay six poor souls who were to be executed that day, some for one crime, some for another, and two for murder.

This was followed by a confused clamour in the house among the several prisoners, expressing their awkward sorrows for the poor creatures that were to die, but in a manner extremely differing one from another;some cried for them; some brutishly huzza’d, and wished them a good journey; some damned and cursed those that had brought them to it; many pitying them; and some few, but very few, praying for them.

There was hardly room for so much composure of mind as was required for me to bless the merciful Providence that had, as it were, snatched me out of the jaws of this destruction. I remained, as it were, dumb and silent, overcome with the sense of it, and not able to express what I had in my heart; for the passions, on such occasions as these, are certainly so agitated as not to be able presently to regulate their own motions.

All the while the poor condemned creatures were preparing for death, and the ordinary, as they call him, was busy with them, disposing them to submit to their sentence. I saw all this while I was seized with a fit of trembling, as much as I could have been if I had been in the same condition as I was the day before. I was so violenty agitated by this surprising fit that I shook as if it had been in an ague; so that I could not speak or look, but like one distracted. As soon as they were all put into the carts and gone, which however I had not courage enough to see; I say, as soon as they were gone, I fell into a fit of crying involuntarily, as a mere distemper, and yet so violent, and it held me so long, that I knew not what course to take, nor could I stop or put a check to it, no, not with all the strength and courage I had.

This fit of crying held me near two hours, and as I believe held me till they were all out of the world, and then a most humble, penitent, serious kind of joy succeeded; a real transport it was, or passion of thankfulness, and in this I continued most part of the day.

In the evening the good minister visited me again and fell to his usual good discourses. He congratulated my having a space yet allowed me for repentance, whereas the state of those six poor creatures was determined, and they were now passed the offers of salvation. He pressed me to retain the same sentiments of the things of life that I had when I had a view of Eternity; and at the end of all told me that I should not conclude that all was over, that a reprieve was not a pardon, that he could not answer for the effects of it, However, I had this mercy, that I had more time given me, and it was my business to improve that time.

This discourse left a kind of sadness on my heart, as if I might expect the affair would have a tragical issue still, which, however, he had no certainty of. Yet I did not at that time question him about it, he having said he would do his utmost to bring it to a good end, and that he hoped he might, but he would not have me be secure; and the consequence showed that he had reason for what he said.

It was about a fortnight after this that I had some just apprehensions that I should be included in the dead warrant at the ensuing sessions;and it was not without great difficulty, and at last an humble petition for transportation, that I avoided it; so ill was I beholding to fame, and so prevailing was the report of being an old offender, though in that they did not do me strict justice, for I was not in the sense of the law an old offender, whatever I was in the eye of the judge; for I had never been before them in a judicial way before, so the judges could not charge me with being an old offender, but the recorder was pleased to represent my case as he thought fit.

I had now a certainty of life indeed, but with the hard conditions of being ordered for transportation, which was, I say, a hard condition in itself, but not when comparatively considered; and therefore I shall make no comments upon the sentence, nor upon the choice I was put to. We all shall choose anything rather than death, especially when ’tis attended with an uncomfortable prospect beyond it, which was my case.

The good minister, whose interest, though a stranger to me, had obtained me the reprieve, mourned sincerely for his part. “He was in hopes,” he said, “that I should have ended my days under the influence of good instruction, that I might not have forgot my former distresses, and that I should not have been turned loose again among such a wretched crew as are thus sent abroad, where,” he said, “I must have more than ordinary secret assistance from the Grace of God, if I did not turn as wicked again as ever.”

I have not for a good while mentioned my governess, who had been dangerously sick, and being in as near a view of death by her disease as I was by my sentence, was a very great penitent. I say I have not mentioned her, nor indeed did I see her in all this time, but being now recovering and just able to come abroad, she came to see me.

I told her my condition and what a different flux and reflux of fears and hopes I had been agitated with. I told her what I had escaped, and upon what terms; and she was present when the minister expressed his fears of my relapsing again into wickedness, upon my falling into the wretched company that are generally transported. Indeed, I had a melancholy reflection upon it in my own mind, for I knew what a dreadful gang was always sent away together, and said to my governess that the good minister’s fears were not without cause. “Well, well,” says she,“but I hope you will not be tempted with such a horrid example as that.”And as soon as the minister was gone she told me she would not have me discouraged, for perhaps ways and means might be found to dispose of me in a particular way, by myself, of which she would talk further with me afterward.

I looked earnestly at her and thought she looked more cheerful than she usually had done, and I entertained immediately a thousand notions of being delivered, but could not for my life imagine the methods or think of one that was feasible; but I was too much concerned in it to let her go from me without explaining herself, which though she was very loath to do, yet, as I was still pressing, she answered me in a few words thus, “Why, you have money, have you not? Did you ever know one in your life that was transported, and had a hundred pounds in his pocket, I’ll warrant ye, child,” says she.

I understood her presently, but told her I saw no room to hope for anything but a strict execution of the order, and as it was a severity that was esteemed a mercy, there was no doubt but it would be strictly observed. She said no more but this, “We will try what can be done,” and so we parted.

I lay in the prison nearly fifteen weeks after this; what the reason of it was, I know not, but at the end of this time I was put on board of a ship in the Thames, and with me a gang of thirteen, as hardened vile creatures as ever Newgate produced in my time; and it would really well take up a history longer than mine, to describe the degrees of impudence and audacious villainy that those thirteen were arrived to, and the manner of their behaviour in the voyage, of which I have a very diverting account by me, which the captain of the ship who carried them over gave me, and which he caused his mate to write down at large.

It may perhaps be thought trifling to enter here into a relation of all the little incidents which attended me in this interval of my circumstances;I mean, between the final order for my transportation and the time of going on board the ship, and I am too near the end of my story to allow room for it; but something relating to me and my Lancashire husband I must not omit.

He had, as I have observed already, been carried from the master’s side of the ordinary prison into the press-yard, with three of his comrades, for they found another to add to them after some time; here, for what reason I knew not, they were kept without being brought to a trial almost three months. It seems they found means to bribe or buy off some who were to come in against them, and they wanted evidence to convict them.After some puzzle on this account, they made shift to get enough proof against two of them to carry them off; but the other two, of which my Lancashire husband was one, lay still in suspense. They had, I think, one positive evidence against each of them; but the law obliging them to have two witnesses, they could make nothing of it; yet they were resolved not to part with the men neither, not doubting but evidence would at last come in; and in order to this, I think publication was made that such prisoners were taken, and anyone might come to the prison and see them.

I took this opportunity to satisfy my curiosity, pretending I had been robbed in the Dunstable coach, and that I would go to see the two high-waymen; but when I came into the press-yard, I so disguised myself, and muffled my face up so, that he could see little of me, and knew nothing of who I was. But when I came back I said publicly that I knew them very well.

Immediately it was all over the prison that Moll Flanders would turn evidence against one of the highwaymen, and that I was to come off by it from the sentence of transportation.

They heard of it, and immediately my husband desired to see this Mrs. Flanders that knew him so well, and was to be an evidence against him, and accordingly I had leave to go to him. I dressed myself up as well as the best clothes that I suffered myself ever to appear in there would allow me, and went to the press-yard, but had a hood over my face. He said little to me at first, but asked me if I knew him. I told him, “Yes, very well;” but as I concealed my face, so I counterfeited my voice too, that he had no guess at who I was. He asked me where I had seen him, I told him between Dunstable and Brickill, but turning to the keeper that stood by, I asked if I might not be admitted to talk with him alone. He said, “Yes, yes,” and so very civilly withdrew.

As soon as he was gone and I had shut the door, I threw off my hood, and bursting out into tears, “My dear,” said I, “do you not know me?”

He turned pale and stood speechless, like one thunderstruck, and not able to conquer the surprise, said no more but this, “Let me sit down;”and sitting down by the table, leaning his head on his hand, fixed his eyes on the ground as one stupid.

I cried so vehemently on the other hand, that it was a good while e’er I could speak any more; but after I had given vent to my passion I repeated the same words: “My dear, do you not know me?” At which he answered, “Yes,” and said no more a good while.

After some time continuing in the surprise, as above, he cast up his eyes towards me and said, “How could you be so cruel?”

I did not really understand what he meant; and I answered, “How can you call me cruel?”

“To come to me,” says he, “in such a place at this, is it not to insult me? I have not robbed you, at least, not on the highway.”

I perceived by this that he knew nothing of the miserable circumstances I was in, and thought that having got intelligence of his being there, I had come to upbraid him with his leaving me; but I had too much to say to him to be affronted, and told him in a few words that I was far from coming to insult him, but at best I came to condole mutually; that he would be easily satisfied that I had no such view when I should tell him that my condition was worse than his, and that many ways. He looked a little concerned at the expression of my condition being worse than his; but with a kind of a smile said, “How can that be, when you see me fettered, and in Newgate, and two of my companions executed already? Can you say your condition is worse than mine?”

“Come, my dear,” says I, “we have a long piece of work to do, if I should be to relate, or you to hear, my unfortunate history; but if you will hear it, you will soon conclude with me that my condition is worse than yours,”

“How is that possible,” says he, “when I expect to be cast for my life the very next sessions?”

“Yes,” says I, “’tis very possible, when I shall tell you that I have been cast for my life three sessions ago, and am now under sentence of death. is not my case worse than yours?”

Then, indeed, he stood silent again, like one struck dumb, and after a little while he starts up. “Unhappy couple!” says he. “How can this be possible?”

I took him by the hand. “Come, my dear,” said I, “sit down, and let us compare our sorrows. I am a prisoner in this very house, and in a much worse circumstance than you, and you will be satisfied I do not come to insult you when I tell you the particulars;” and with this we sat down together, and I told him so much of my story as I thought convenient, bringing it at last to my being reduced to great poverty, and representing myself as fallen into some company that led me to relieve my distresses by a way that I had been utterly unacquainted with, and that they making an attempt on a tradesman’s house, I was seized upon for having been but just at the door, the maidservant pulling me in; that I neither had broke any lock, or taken anything away, and that notwithstanding that, I was brought in guilty, and sentenced to die; but that the judges, having been made sensible of the hardship of my circumstances, had obtained leave for me to be transported.

I told him I fared the worse for being taken in the prison for one Moll Flanders, who was a famous successful thief, that all of them had heard of, but none of them had ever seen, but that, as he knew, was none of my name; but I placed all to the account of my ill fortune, and that under this name I was dealt with as an old offender, though this was the first thing they had ever known of me. I gave him a long account of what had befallen me since I saw him; but told him I had seen him since, he might think I had; then gave him an account how I had seen him at Brickill; how he was pursued, and how by giving an account that I knew him, and that he was a very honest gentleman, the hue and cry was stopped, and the high constable went back again.

He listened most attentively to all my story, and smiled at the particulars, being all of them infinitely below what he had been at the head of; but when I came to the story of Little Brickill, he was surprised,“And was it you, my dear,” said he, “that gave the check to the mob at Brickhill?”

“Yes,” said I, “it was I indeed.” Then I told him the particulars which I had observed of him there.

“Why then,” said he, “it was you that saved my life at that time, and I am glad I owe my life to you, for I will pay the debt to you now, and I’ll deliver you from the present condition you are in, or I will die in the attempt.”

I told him by no means; it was a risk too great, not worth his running the hazard of, and for a life not worth his saving.

“Twas no matter for that,” he said; “it was a life worth all the world to him; a life that had given him a new life; for,” says he, “I was never in real danger, but that time, till the last minute when I was taken.” Indeed his danger then lay in his believing he had not been pursued that way; for they had gone off from Hockley quite another way, and had come over the enclosed country into Brickill, and were sure they had not been seen by anybody.

Here he gave a long history of his life, which indeed would make a very strange history, and be infinitely diverting. He told me that he took the road about twelve years before he married me; that the woman which called him brother was not any kin to him, but one that belonged to their gang, and who, keeping correspondence with them, lived always in Town, having great acquaintance; that she gave them perfect intelligence of persons going out of Town, and that they had made several good booties by her correspondence; that she thought she had fixed a fortune for him when she brought me to him, but happened to be disappointed, which he really could not blame her for. That, if I had had an estate, which she was informed I had, he had resolved to leave off the road and live a new life, but never to appear in public till some general pardon had been passed, or till he could, for money, have got his name into some particular pardon, so that he might have been perfectly easy, but that as it had proved other-wise he was obliged to take up the old trade again.

He gave a long account of some of his adventures, and particularly one, where he robbed the West Chester coaches, near Lichfield, when he got a very great booty; and after that, how he robbed five graziers in the West, going to Burford Fair in Wiltshire to buy sheep. He told me he got so much money on those two occasions, that if he had known where to have found me, he would certainly have embraced my proposal of going with me to Virginia; or to have settled in a plantation on some other of the English colonies in America.

He told me he wrote three letters to me, directed according to my order, but heard nothing from me. This, indeed, I knew to be true, but the letters coming to my hand in the time of my latter husband, I could do nothing in it, and therefore gave no answer, that so he might believe they had miscarried.

Being thus disappointed, he said, he carried on the old trade ever since, though when he had gotten so much money, he said, he did not run such desperate risks as he did before. Then he gave me some account of several hard and desperate encounters which he had with gentlemen on the road who parted too hardly with their money; and showed me some wounds he had received, and he had one or two very terrible wounds indeed, particularly one by a pistol bullet, which broke his arm; and another with a sword which run him quite through the body, but that missing his vitals he was cured again; one of his comrades having kept with him so faithfully, and so friendly, as that he assisted him in riding near eighty miles before his arm was set, and then got a surgeon in a considerable city,remote from the place where it was done, pretending they were gentleman travelling towards Carlisle, that they had been attacked on the road by highwaymen, and that one of them had shot him into the arm.

This, he said, his friend managed so well, that they were not suspected, but lay still till he was cured. He gave me also so many distinct accounts of his adventures, that it is with great reluctance that I decline the relating them: but this is my own story, not his.

I then enquired into the circumstances of his present case, and what it was he expected when he came to be tried. He told me that they had no evidence against him, for that of the three robberies which they were all charged with, it was his good fortune that he was but in one of them, and that there was but one witness to be had to that fact, which was not sufficient; but that it was expected some others would come in, and that he thought when he first seen me I had been one that came of that errand;but that if nobody came in against him, he hoped he should be cleared;that he had some intimation that if he would submit to transport himself he might be admitted to it without a trial, but that he could not think of it with any temper, and thought he could much easier submit to be hanged.

I blamed him for that; first, because if he was transported there might be an hundred ways for him, that was a gentleman, and a bold, enterprising man, to find his way back again, and perhaps some ways and means to come back before he went. He smiled at that part, and said he should like the last the best of the two, for he had a kind of horror upon his mind at his being sent to the plantations as the Romans sent slaves to work in the mines; that he thought the passage into another state much more tolerable at the gallows, and that this was the general notion of all the gentlemen who were driven by the exigence of their fortunes to take the road; that at the place of execution there was at least an end of all the miseries of the present state, and as for what was to follow, a man was, in his opinion, as likely to repent sincerely in the last fortnight of his life under the agonies of a gaol, and the condemned hole, as he would ever be in the woods and wildernesses of America; that servitude and hard labour were things gentlemen could never stoop to; that it was but the way to force them to be their own executioners, which was much worse, and that he could not have any patience when he did but think of it.

I used the utmost of my endeavour to persuade him, and joined that known woman’s rhetoric to it, I mean that of tears. I told him the infamy of a public execution was certainly a greater pressure upon the spirits of a gentleman than any mortifications that he could meet with abroad; that he had at least in the other a chance for his life, whereas here he had none at all; that it was the easiest thing in the world for him to manage the captain of a ship, who were, generally speaking, men of good humour; and a small matter of conduct, especially if there was any money to be had, would make way for him to buy himself off when he came to Virginia.

He looked wishfully at me, and I guessed he meant that he had no money, but I was mistaken, his meaning was another way. “You hinted just now, my dear,” said he, “that there might be a way of coming back before I went, by which I understood you that it might be possible to buy it off here. I had rather give £200 to prevent going, than £100 to be set at liberty when I came there.”

“That is, my dear,” said I, “because you do not know the place as well as I do.”

“That may be,” said he, “and yet I believe, as well as you know it, you would do the same, unless it is because, as you told me, you have a mother there.”

I told him, as to my mother, she must be dead many years before;and as for any other relations that I might have there, I knew them not. That since my misfortunes had reduced me to the condition I had been in for some years, I had not kept up any correspondence with them; and that he would easily believe I should find but a cold reception from them if I should be put to make my first visit in the condition of a transported felon; that therefore if I went thither I resolved not to see them; but that I had many views in going there, which took off all the uneasy part of it;and if he found himself obliged to go also, I should easily instruct him how to manage himself, so as never to go a servant at all, especially since I found he was not destitute of money, which was the only friend in such a condition.

He smiled, and said he did not tell me he had money. I took him up short, and told him I hoped he did not understand by my speaking, that I should expect any supply from him if he had money; that on the other hand, though I had not a great deal, yet I did not want, and while I had any I would rather add to him, than weaken him, seeing whatever he had, I knew in the case of transportation he would have occasion of it all.

He expressed himself in a most tender manner upon that head; he told me what money he had was not a great deal, but that he would never hide any of it from me if I wanted it; and assured me he did not speak with any such apprehensions; that he was only intent upon what I had hinted to him; that here he knew what to do, but there he should be the most helpless wretch alive.

I told him he frighted himself with that which had no terror in it; that if he had money, as I was glad to hear he had, he might not only avoid the servitude supposed to be the consequence of transportation, but begin the world upon such a new foundation, as he could not fail of success in, with but the common application usual in such cases; that he could not but call to mind I had recommended it to him many years before, and proposed it for restoring our fortunes in the world; and I would tell him now, to convince him both of the certainty of it, and of my being fully acquainted with the method, and also fully satisfied in the probability of success, he should first see me deliver myself from the necessity of going over at all, and then that I would go with him freely, and of my own choice, and perhaps carry enough with me to satisfy him; that I did not offer it for want of being able to live without assistance from him; but that I thought our mutual misfortunes had been such as were sufficient to reconcile us both to quitting this part of the world, and living where nobody could up-braid us with what was past, and without the agonies of a condemned hole to drive us to it, where we should look back on all our past disasters with infinite satisfaction, when we should consider that our enemies should entirely forget us, and that we should live as new people in a new world, nobody having anything to say to us, or we to them.

I pressed this home to him with so many arguments, and answered all his passionate objections so effectually, that he embraced me, and told me I treated him with such a sincerity as overcame him; that he would take my advice, and would strive to submit to his fate, in hope of having the comfort of so faithful a counsellor, and such a companion in his misery;but still he put me in mind of what I had mentioned before, viz., that there might be some way to get off before he went, and that it might be possible to avoid going at all, which he said would be much better. I told him he should see, and be fully satisfied that I would do my utmost in that part too, and if it did not succeed, yet that I would make good the rest.

We parted after this long conference with such testimonies of kindness and affection as I thought were equal, if not superior, to that at our parting at Dunstable; and now I saw more plainly the reason why he then declined coming with me toward London; and why when we parted there he told me it was not convenient for him to come to London with me, as he would otherwise have done. I have observed that the account of his life would have made a much more pleasing history than this of mine;and, indeed, nothing in it was more strange than this part, viz., that he carried on that desperate trade full five-and-twenty years, and had never been taken; the success he had met with had been so very uncommon, and such, that sometimes he had lived handsomely and retired in one place for a year or two at a time, keeping himself and a man servant to wait on him, and has often sat in the coffee-houses, and heard the very people who he had robbed give accounts of their being robbed, and of the places and circumstances, so that he could easily remember that it was the same.

In this manner it seems he lived near Liverpool at the time he unluckily married me for a fortune. Had I been the fortune he expected, I verily believe he would have taken up and lived honestly.

He had with the rest of his misfortunes the good luck not to be actually upon the spot when the robbery was done which they were committed for; and so none of the persons robbed could swear to him; but it seems as he was taken with the gang, one hard-mouthed country man swore home to him; and according to the publication they had made, they expected more evidence against him, and for that reason he was kept in hold.

However, the offer which was made to him of transportation, was made, as I understood, upon the intercession of some great person who pressed him hard to accept of it; and as he knew there were several that might come in against him, I thought his friend was in the right, and I lay at him night and day to delay it no longer.

At last, with much difficulty, he gave his consent, and as he was not therefore, admitted to transportation in court, and on his petition, as I was, so he found himself under a difficulty to avoid embarking himself as I had said he might have done; his friend having given security for him that he should transport himself, and not return within the term.

This hardship broke all my measures, for the steps I took afterwards for my own deliverance were hereby rendered wholly ineffectual, unless I would abandon him, and leave him to go to America by himself; than which, he protested, he would much rather go directly to the gallows.

I must now return to my own case. The time of my being transported was near at hand; my governess, who continued my fast friend, had tried to obtain a pardon, but it could not be done unless with an expense too heavy for my purse, considering that to be left empty, unless I had resolved to return to my old trade, had been worse than transportation, because there I could live, here I could not. The good minister stood very hard on another account to prevent my being transported also; but he was answered, that my life had been given me at his first solicitations, and therefore he ought to ask no more; he was sensibly grieved at my going, because, as he said, he feared I should lose the good impressions which a prospect of death had at first made on me, and which were since increased by his instructions; and the pious gentleman was exceedingly concerned on that account.

On the other hand, I was not so solicitous about it now, but I concealed my reasons for it from the minister, and to the last he did not know but that I went with the utmost reluctance and affliction.

It was in the month of February that I was with thirteen other convicts delivered to a merchant that traded to Virginia, on board a ship riding in Deptford Reach. The officer of the prison delivered us on board, and the master of the vessel gave a discharge for us.

We were for that night clapped under hatches, and kept so close that I thought I should have been suffocated for want of air, and the next morning the ship weighed, and fell down the river to a place called Bugby’s Hole, which was done, as they told us, by the agreement of the merchant, that all opportunity of escape should be taken from us. However, when the ship came thither and cast anchor, we were permitted to come upon the deck, but not upon the quarter-deck, that being kept particularly for the captain and for passengers.

When by the noise of the men over my head and the motion of the ship, I perceived they were under sail, I was at first greatly surprised, fearing we should go away, and that our friends would not be admitted to see us; but I was easy soon after, when I found they had come to an anchor, and that we had notice given by some of the men that the next morning we should have the liberty to come upon deck, and to have our friends come to see us.

All that night I lay upon the hard deck, as the other prisoners did, but we had afterwards little cabins allowed for such as had any bedding to lay in them; and room to stow any box or trunk for clothes, and linen, if we had it (which might well be put in), for some of them had neither shirt or shift, linen or woollen, but what was on their backs, or one farthing of money to help themselves; yet I did not find but they fared well enough in the ship, especially the women, who got money of the seamen for washing their clothes, etc., sufficient to purchase anything they wanted.

When the next morning we had the liberty to come upon deck, I asked one of the officers whether I might not be allowed to send a letter on shore to let my friends know where we lay, and to get some necessary things sent to me. This was the boatswain, a very civil, courteous man, who told me I should have any liberty that I desired that he could allow me with safety. I told him I desired no other; and he answered, the ship’s boat would go up to London next tide, and he would order my letter to be carried.

Accordingly when the boat went off, the boatswain came and told me the boat was going off, that he went in it himself, and if my letter was ready, he would take care of it. I had prepared pen, ink, and paper beforehand, and had gotten a letter ready directed to my governess, and enclosed another to my fellow prisoner, which, however, I did not let her know was my husband, not to the last; in that to my governess I let her know where the ship lay, and pressed her to send me what things she had got ready for me for my voyage.

When I gave the boatswain the letter I gave him a shilling with it, which I told him was for the charge of a porter, which I had entreated him to send with the letter as soon as he came on shore, that if possible I might have an answer brought back by the same hand, that I might know what was become of my things. “For, sir,” says I, “if the ship should go away before I have them, I am undone.”

I took care when I gave him the shilling to let him see I had a little better furniture about me than the ordinary prisoners, that I had a purse, and in it a pretty deal of money, and I found that the very sight of it immediately furnished me with very different treatment from what I should otherwise have met with; for though he was courteous indeed before, in a kind of natural compassion to me, as a woman in distress; yet he was more than ordinarily so afterwards, and procured me to be better treated in the ship than, I say, I might otherwise have been, as shall appear in its place.

He very honestly delivered my letter to my governess’s own hands, and brought me back her answer; and when he gave it me, gave me the shilling again. “There,” says he, “there’s your shilling again, too, for I delivered the letter myself.”

I could not tell what to say, I was so surprised at the thing; but after some pause, I said, “Sir, you are too kind. It had been but reasonable that you had paid yourself coach hire, then.”

“No, no,” says he. “I am overpaid. What is that gentlewoman, is she your sister?”

“No, sir,” said I, “she is no relation to me, but is a dear friend, and all the friends I have in the world.”

“Well,” says he, “there are few such friends. Why, she cries after you like a child.”

“Ay,” says I again, “she would give a hundred pounds, I believe, to deliver me from this dreadful condition.”

“Would she so?” says he. “For half the money, I believe I could put you in a way how to deliver yourself,” but this he spoke softly that nobody could hear.

“Alas! sir,” said I, “but then that must be such a deliverance as if I should be taken again would cost me my life.”

“Nay,” said he, “if you were once out of the ship, you must look to yourself afterwards; that I can say nothing to.” So we dropped the discourse for that time.

In the meantime my governess, faithful to the last moment, conveyed my letter to the prison to my husband, and got an answer to it, and the next day came down herself, bringing me, in the first place, a sea bed, as they call it, and all its ordinary furniture; she brought me also a sea chest, that is, a chest, such as are made for seamen, with all the conveniences in it, and filled with everything almost that I could want; and in one of the corners of the chest, where there was a private drawer, was my bank of money, that is to say, so much of it as I had resolved to carry with me; for I ordered part of my stock to be left behind, to be sent afterwards in such goods as I should want when I came to settle; for money in that country is not of much use, where all things are bought for tobacco, much more is it a great loss to carry in from hence.

But my case was particular. it was by no means proper for me to go without money or goods, and for a poor convict that was to be sold as soon as I came on shore, to carry a cargo of goods would be to have notice taken of it, and perhaps to have them seized; so I took part of my stock with me thus, and left the rest with my governess.

My governess brought me a great many other things, but it was not proper for me to appear too well, at least, till I knew what kind of a captain we should have. When she came into the ship I thought she would have died indeed; her heart sunk at the sight of me, and at the thoughts of parting with me in that condition, and she cried so intolerably, I could not for a long time have any talk with her.

I took that time to read my fellow prisoner’s letter, which greatly perplexed me. He told me it would be impossible for him to be discharged time enough for going in the same ship, and which was more than all, he began to question whether they would give him leave to go in what ship he pleased, though he did voluntarily transport himself; but that they would see him put on board such a ship as they should direct, and that he would be charged upon the captain as other convict prisoners were; so that he began to be in despair of seeing me till he came to Virginia, which made him almost desperate, seeing that on the other hand, if I should not be there, if any accident of the sea, or of mortality should take me away, he should be the most undone creature in the world.

This was very perplexing, and I knew not what course to take. I told my governess the story of the boatswain, and she was mighty eager with me to treat with him; but I had no mind to it, till I heard whether my husband or fellow prisoner, so she called him, could be at liberty to go with me or no; at last I was forced to let her into the whole matter, except only that of his being my husband. I told her that I had made a positive agreement with him to go, if he could get the liberty of going in the same ship, and I found he had money.

Then I told her what I proposed to do when we came there, how we could plant, settle, and, in short, grow rich without any more adventures, and as a great secret, I told her we were to marry as soon as he came on board.

She soon agreed cheerfully to my going when she heard this, and she made it her business from that time to get him delivered in time, so that he might go in the same ship with me, which at last was brought to pass, though with great difficulty, and not without all the forms of a transported convict, which he really was not, for he had not been tried, and which was a great mortification to him. As our fate was now determined, and we were both on board, actually bound to Virginia, in the despicable quality of transported convicts, destined to be sold for slaves, I for five years, and he under bonds and security not to return to England any more as long as he lived, he was very much dejected and cast down; the mortification of being brought on board as he was, like a prisoner, piqued him very much, since it was first told him he should transport himself, so that he might go as a gentleman at liberty. It is true he was not ordered to be sold when he came there, as we were, and for that reason he was obliged to pay for his passage to the captain, which we were not; as to the rest, he was as much at a loss as a child what to do with himself, but by directions.

However, I lay in an uncertain condition full three weeks, not knowing whether I should have my husband with me or no; and, therefore, not resolved how, or in what manner, to receive the honest boatswain’s proposal, which, indeed, he thought a little strange.

At the end of this time, behold my husband came on board. He looked with a dejected, angry countenance, his great heart was swelled with rage and disdain, to be dragged along with three keepers of Newgate, and put on board like a convict, when he had not so much as been brought to a trial. He made loud complaints of it by his friends, for it seems he had some interest; but they got some check in their application, and were told he had had favour enough, and that they had received such an account of him since the last grant of his transportation, that he ought to think himself very well treated that he was not prosecuted anew. This answer quieted him, for he knew too much what might have happened, and what he had room to expect; and now he saw the goodness of that advice to him, which prevailed with him to accept of the offer of transportation; and after his chagrin at these hell hounds, as he called them, was a little over, he looked more composed, began to be cheerful, and as I was telling him how glad I was to have him once more out of their hands, he took me in his arms, and acknowledged with great tenderness that I had given him the best advice possible. “My dear,” says he, “thou hast twice saved my life, from hence forward it shall be employed for you, and I’ll always take your advice.”

Our first business was to compare our stock. He was very honest to me, and told me his stock was pretty good when he came into the prison, but that living there as he did like a gentleman, and, which was more, the making of friends, and soliciting his case, had been very expensive; and, in a word, all his stock left was a hundred and eight pounds, which he had about him in gold.

I gave him an account of my stock as faithfully, that is to say, what I had taken with me; for I was resolved whatever should happen, to keep what I had left in reserve; that in case I should die, what I had was enough to give him, and what was left in my governess’s hands would be her own, which she had well deserved of me indeed.

My stock which I had with me was two hundred and fortysix pounds some odd shillings; so that we had three hundred and fifty-four pounds between us; but a worse gotten estate was never put together to begin the world with.

Our greatest misfortune as to our stock was that it was in money, an unprofitable cargo to be carried to the plantations. I believe his was really all he had left in the world, as he told me it was. But I, who had between seven and eight hundred pounds in bank when this disaster befell me, and who had one of the faithfullest friends in the world to manage it for me, considering she was a woman of no principles, had still three hundred pounds left in her hand, which I had reserved, as above; besides I had some very valuable things with me, as particularly two gold watches, some small pieces of plate, and some rings; all stolen goods. With this fortune, and in the sixty-first year of my age, I launched out into a new world, as I may call it, in the condition only of a poor convict, ordered to be transported in respite from the gallows; my clothes were poor and mean, but not ragged or dirty, and none knew in the whole ship that I had anything of value about me.

However, as I had a great many very good clothes, and linen in abundance, which I had ordered to be packed up in two great boxes, I had them shipped on board, not as my goods, but as consigned to my real name in Virginia; and had the bills of loading in my pocket; and in these boxes were my plate and watches, and everything of value, except my money, which I kept by itself in a private drawer in my chest, and which could not be found, or opened if found, without spliting the chest to pieces.

The ship began now to fill, several passengers came on board, who were embarked on no criminal account, and these had accommodations assigned them in the great cabin, and other parts of the ship, whereas we, as convicts, were thrust down below, I know not where; but when my husband came on board I spoke to the boatswain, who had so early given me hints of his friendship; I told him he had befriended me in many things, and I had not made any suitable return to him, and with that I put a guinea into his hand; I told him that my husband was now come on board, that though we were under the present misfortunes, yet we had been persons of a differing character from the wretched crew that we came with, and desired to know whether the captain might not be moved to admit us to some conveniences in the ship, for which we would make him what satisfaction he pleased, and that we would gratify him for his pains in procuring this for us. He took the guinea, as I could see, with great satisfaction, and assured me of his assistance.

Then he told us he did not doubt but that the captain, who was one of the best humoured gentlemen in the world, would be easily brought to accommodate us, as well as we could desire, and to make me easy, told me he would go up the next tide on purpose to speak to him about it. The next morning, happening to sleep a little longer than ordinary, when I got up, and began to look abroad, I saw the boatswain among the men in his ordinary business. I was a little melancholy at seeing him there, and going forwards to speak to him, he saw me, and came towards me, but not giving him time to speak first, I said, smiling, “I doubt, sir, you have forgot us, for I see you are very busy.”

He returned presently, “Come along with me, and you shall see.” So he took me into the great cabin, and there sat a good sort of a gentlemanly man writing, and a great many papers before him.

“Here,” says the boatswain to him that was a-writing, “is the gentlewoman that the captain spoke to you of;” and turning to me, he said, “I have been so far from forgetting your business, that I have been up at the captain’s house, and have represented faithfully what you said, of your being furnished with conveniences for yourself, and your husband; and the captain has sent this gentleman, who is mate of the ship, down on purpose to show you everything, and to accommodate you to your content, and bid me assure you that you shall not be treated like what you were expected to be, but with the same respect as other passengers are treated.”

The mate then spoke to me, and not giving me time to thank the boatswain for his kindness, confirmed what the boatswain had said, and added, that it was the captain’s delight to show himself kind, and charitable, especially to those that were under any misfortunes, and with that he showed me several cabins built up, some in the great cabin, and some partitioned off, out of the steerage, but opening into the great cabin on purpose for passengers, and gave me leave to choose where I would. I chose a cabin in the steerage, in which were very good conveniences to set our chest, and boxes, and a table to eat on.

The mate then told me that the boatswain had given so good a character of me, and of my husband, that he had orders to tell me we should eat with him if we thought fit, during the whole voyage, on the common terms of passengers; that we might lay in some fresh provisions if we pleased; or, if not, he should lay in his usual store, and that we should have share with him. This was very reviving news to me, after so many hardships and afflictions. I thanked him, and told him the captain should make his own terms with us, and asked him leave to go and tell my husband of it, who was not very well, and was not yet out of his cabin. Accordingly, I went, and my husband, whose spirits were still so much sunk with the indignity (as he understood it) offered him, that he was scarce yet himself, was so revived with the account I gave him of the reception we were like to have in the ship, that he was quite another man, and new vigour and courage appeared in his very countenance; so true is it, that the greatest spirits, when overwhelmed by their afflictions, are subject to the greatest dejections.

After some little pause to recover himself, my husband came up with me, and gave the mate thanks for the kindness which he had expressed to us, and sent suitable acknowledgments by him to the captain, offering to pay him by advance whatever he demanded for our passage, and for the conveniences he had helped us to. The mate told him that the captain would be on board in the afternoon, and that he would leave all that to him. Accordingly, in the afternoon, the captain came, and we found him the same courteous, obliging man that the boatswain had represented him;and he was so well pleased with my husband’s conversation that, in short, he would not let us keep the cabin we had chosen, but gave us one that, as I said before, opened into the great cabin.

Nor were his conditions exorbitant, or the man craving and eager to make a prey of us, but for fifteen guineas we had our whole passage and provisions, ate at the captain’s table, and were very handsomely entertained.

The captain lay himself in the other part of the great cabin, having let his round house, as they call it, to a rich planter, who went over with his wife and three children, who ate by themselves. He had some other ordinary passengers, who quartered in the steerage; and as for our old fraternity, they were kept under the hatches, and came very little on the deck.

I could not refrain acquainting my governess with what had happened, it was but just that she, who was really concerned for me, should have part in my good fortune; besides I wanted her assistance to supply me with several necessaries which before I was shy of letting anybody see me have; but now I had a cabin and room to set things in, I ordered abundance of good things for our comfort in the voyage, as brandy, sugar, lemons, etc., to make punch, and treat our benefactor, the captain; and abundance of things for eating and drinking; also a larger bed, and bedding proportioned to it; so that, in a word, we resolved to want for nothing.

All this while I had provided nothing for our assistance, when we should come to the place and begin to call ourselves planters; and I was far from being ignorant of what was needful on that occasion; particularly all sorts of tools for the planter’s work, and for building; and all kinds of house furniture, which, if to be bought in the country, must necessarily cost double the price.

I discoursed that point with my governess, and she went and waited upon the captain, and told him that she hoped ways might be found out for her two unfortunate cousins, as she called us, to obtain our freedom when we came into the country, and so entered into a discourse with him about the means and terms also, of which I shall say more in its place; and after thus sounding the captain, she let him know, though we were unhappy in the circumstance that occasioned our going, yet that we were not unfurnished to set ourselves to work in the country; and were resolved to settle, and live there as planters. The captain readily offered his assistance, told her the method of entering upon such business, and how easy, nay, how certain, it was for industrious people to recover their fortunes in such a manner. “Madam,” says he, “’tis no reproach to any man in that country to have been sent over in worse circumstances than I perceive your cousins are in, provided they do but apply with good judgment to the business of the place when they come there.”

She then enquired of him what things it was necessary we should carry over with us, and he, like a knowing man, told her thus: “Madam, your cousins first must procure somebody to buy them as servants, in conformity to the conditions of their transportation, and then in the name of that person they may go about what they will; they may either purchase some plantations already begun, or they may purchase land of the Government of the country, and begin where they please, and both will be done reasonably.” She bespoke his favour in the first article, which he promised to her to take upon himself, and indeed faithfully performed it;and as to the rest, he promised to recommend us to such as should give us the best advice, and not to impose upon us, which was as much as could be desired.

She then asked him if it would not be necessary to furnish us with a stock of tools and materials for the business of planting, and he said,“Yes, by all means.” Then she begged his assistance in that, and told him she would furnish us with everything that was convenient, whatever it cost her. He accordingly gave her a list of things necessary for a planter, which by his account came to about fourscore or an hundred pounds; and, in short, she went, about as dexterously to buy them as if she had been an old Virginia merchant; only that she bought, by my direction, above twice as much of everything as he had given her a list of.

These she put on board in her own name, took his bills of loading for them, and endorsed those bills of loading to my husband, insuring the cargo afterwards in her own name; so that we were provided for all events, and for all disasters.

I should have told you that my husband gave her all his own stock of £108, which, as I have said, he had about him in gold, to lay out thus, and I gave her a good sum besides; so that I did not break into the stock which I had left in her hands at all, but after all we had near £200 in money, which was more than enough for our purpose.

In this condition very cheerful, and indeed joyful at being so happily accommodated, we set sail from Bugby’s Hole to Gravesend, where the ship lay about ten days more, and where the captain came on board for good and all. Here the captain offered us a civility which, indeed, we had no reason to expect, viz., to let us go on shore and refresh ourselves, upon giving our words that we would not go from him, and that we would return peacefully on board again. This was such an evidence of his confidence in us that it overcome my husband, who in a mere principle of gratitude, told him, as he could not be in any capacity to make a suitable return for such a favour, so he could not think of accepting it, nor could he be easy that the captain should run such a risk. After some mutual civilities I gave my husband a purse, in which was eighty guineas, and he put it into the captain’s hand: “There, captain,” says he, “there’s part of a pledge for our fidelity; if we deal dishonestly with you on any account, ’tis your own;” and on this we went on shore.

Indeed, the captain had assurance of our resolutions to go, for that having made such provision to settle there, it did not seem rational that we would choose to remain here at the peril of life, for such it must have been. In a word, we went all on shore with the captain, and supped together in Gravesend, where we were very merry, stayed all night, lay at the house where we supped, and came all very honestly on board again with him in the morning. Here we bought ten dozen of bottles of good beer, some wine, some fowls, and such things as we thought might be acceptable on board.

My governess was with us all this while, and went round with us into the Downs, as did also the captain’s wife, with whom she went back. I was never so sorrowful at parting with my own mother as I was at parting with her, and I never saw her more. We had a fair easterly wind the third day after we came to the Downs, and we sailed from thence the, 10th of April; nor did we touch any more at any place, till being driven on the coast of Ireland by a very hard gale of wind, the ship came to an anchor in a little bay, near a river, whose name I remember not, but they said the river came down from Limerick, and that it was the largest river in Ireland.

Here, being detained by bad weather for some time, the captain, who continued the same kind, good humoured man as at first, took us two on shore with him again. He did it now in kindness to my husband,indeed, who bore the sea very ill, especially when it blew so hard. Here we bought again store of fresh provisions, beef, pork, mutton, and fowls, and the captain stayed to pickle up five or six barrels of beef to lengthen out the ship’s store. We were here not above five days, when the weather turning mild, and a fair wind, we set sail again and in two-and-forty days came safe to the coast of Virginia.

When we drew near to the shore the captain called me to him, and told me that he found by my discourse I had some relations in the place, and that I had been there before, and so he supposed I understood the custom in their disposing the convict prisoners when they arrived. I told him I did not, and that as to what relations I had in the place, he might be sure I would make myself known to none of them while in the circumstances of a prisoner, and that as to the rest, we left ourselves entirely to him to assist us, as he was pleased to promise us he would do. He told me I must get somebody in the place to come and buy me as a servant, and who must answer for me to the governor of the country, if he demanded me. I told him we should do as he should direct; so he brought a planter to treat with him, as it were for the purchase of me for a servant, my husband not being ordered to be sold, and there I was formally sold to him, and went ashore with him. The captain went with us, and carried us to a certain house, whether it was to be called a tavern or not, I know not, but we had a bowl of punch there, made of rum, etc., and were very merry. After some time the planter gave us a certificate of discharge, and an acknowledgment of having served him faithfully, and I was free from him the next morning to go whither I would.

For this piece of service the captain demanded of me six thousand weight of tobacco, which he said he was accountable for to his freighter, and we bought for him, and made him a present of twenty guineas besides, which he was abundantly satisfied with.

It is not proper to enter here into the particulars of what part of the colony of Virginia we settled in, for divers reasons; it may suffice to mention that we went into the great river of Potomac, the ship being bound thither; and there we intended to have settled at first, though afterwards we altered our minds.

The first thing I did of moment after having gotten all our goods on shore, and placed them in a storehouse, which, with a lodging, we hired at the small place or village where we landed; I say the first thing was to enquire after my mother, and after my brother (that fatal person who I married as a husband, as I have related at large). A little enquiry furnished me with information that Mrs.—, that is my mother, was dead; that my brother (or husband) was alive, and, which was worse, I found he was removed from the plantation where I lived, and lived with one of his sons in a plantation just by the place where we landed, and had hired a warehouse.

I was a little surprised at first, but as I ventured to satisfy myself that he could not know me, I was not only perfectly easy, but had a great mind to see him, if it was possible, without his seeing me. In order to that, I found out by enquiry the plantation where he lived, and with a woman of the place, who I got to help me, like what we call a charwoman, I rambled about towards the place, as if I had only a mind to see the country, and look about me; at last I came so near that I saw the dwelling-house. I asked the woman whose plantation that was?

She said, it belonged to such a man, and looking out a little to our right hands, “There,” says she, “is the gentleman that owns the plantation, and his father with him.”

“What are their Christian names?” said I.

“I know not,” said she, “what the old gentleman’s name is, but his son’s name is Humphry, and I believe,” says she, “the father’s is so too.”You may guess, if you can, what a confused mixture of joy and fright possessed my thoughts upon this occasion, for I immediately knew that this was nobody else but my own son, by that father she showed me, who was my own brother. I had no mask, but I ruffled my hoods so about my face, that I depended upon it that after above twenty years’ absence, and withal not expecting anything of me in that part of the world, he would not be able to know me. But I need not have used all that caution, for he was grown dim sighted by some distemper which had fallen upon his eyes, and could but just see well enough to walk about and not run against a tree or into a ditch. As they drew near to us, I said, “Does he know you, Mrs. Owen?” So they called the woman.

“Yes,” she said, “if he hears me speak, he will know me; but he can’t see well enough to know me, or anybody else.” And so she told me the story of his sight, as I have related. This made me secure, and so I threw open my hoods again. and let them pass by me. It was a wretched thing for a mother thus to see her own son, a handsome, comely young gentleman in flourishing circumstances, and durst not make herself known to him; and durst not take any notice of him. Let any mother of children that reads this, consider it, and but think with what anguish of mind I restrained myself, what yearnings of soul I had in me to embrace him, and weep over him; and how I thought all my entrails turned within me, that my very bowels moved, and I knew not what to do; as I now know not how to express those agonies. When he went from me I stood gazing and trembling, and looking after him as long as I could see him; then, sitting down on the grass, just at a place I had marked, I made as if I lay down to rest me, but turned from her, and lying on my face, wept and kissed the ground that he had set his foot on.

I could not conceal my disorder so much from the woman but that she perceived it, and thought I was not well, which I was obliged to pretend was true; upon which she pressed me to rise, the ground being damp and dangerous, which I did, and walked away.

As I was going back again, and still talking of this gentleman and his son, a new occasion of melancholy offered itself thus:

The woman began, as if she would tell me a story to divert me:“There goes,” says she, “a very odd tale among the neighbours where this gentleman formerly lived.”

“What was that?” said I.

“Why,” says she, “that old gentleman going to England, when he was a young man, fell in love with a young lady there, one of the finest women that ever was seen here and married her, and brought her over hither to his mother, who was then living. He lived here several years with her,” continued she, “and had several children by her, of which the young gentleman that was with him now was one; but after some time, the old gentlewoman, his mother, talking to her of something relating to herself, and of her circumstances in England, which were bad enough, the daughter-in-law began to be very much surprised and uneasy, and, in short, in examining further into things, it appeared past all contradiction that she (the old gentlewoman) was her own mother, and that consequently that son was her own brother, which struck the family with horror, and put them into such confusion, that it had almost ruined them all. The young woman would not live with him. He for a time went distracted, and at last the young woman went away for England, and has never been heard of since.”

It is easy to believe that I was strangely affected with this story;but ’tis impossible to describe the nature of my disturbance. I seemed astonished at the story, and asked her a thousand questions about the particulars, which I found she was thoroughly acquainted with. At last I began to enquire into the circumstances of the family, how the old gentlewoman, I mean my mother, died, and how she left what she had;for my mother had promised me very solemnly that when she died she would do something for me and leave it so as that, if I was living I should one way or other come at it, without its being in the power of her son, my brother and husband, to prevent it. She told me she did not know exactly how it was ordered; but she had been told that my mother had left a sum of money, and had tied her plantation for the payment of it, to be made good to the daughter if ever she could be heard of, either in England or elsewhere; and that the trust was left with this son, who we saw with his father.

This was news too good for me to make light of, and you may be sure filled my heart with a thousand thoughts, what course I should take, and in what manner I should make myself known, or whether I should ever make myself known, or no.

Here was a perplexity that I had not indeed skill to manage myself in, neither knew I what course to take. It lay heavy upon my mind night and day, I could neither sleep or converse, so that my husband perceived it, wondered what ailed me, and strove to divert me; but it was all to no purpose. He pressed me to tell him what it was troubled me, but I put it off, till at last, importuning me continually, I was forced to form a story, which yet had a plain truth to lay it upon too. I told him I was troubled because I found we must shift our quarters and alter our scheme of settling, for that I found I should be known if I stayed in that part of the country; for that my mother being dead, several of my relations were come into that part where we then were, and that I must either discover myself to them, which in our present circumstances was not proper on many accounts, or remove, and which to do I knew not, and that this it was that made me melancholy.

He joined with me in this, that it was by no means proper for me to make myself known to anybody in the circumstances in which we then were; and therefore he told me he would be willing to remove to any part of the country, or even to any other country, if I thought fit. But now I had another difficulty, which was, that if I removed to another colony, I put myself out of the way of ever making a due search after those things which my mother had left. Again, I could never so much as think of breaking the secret of my former marriage to my new husband; it was not a story would bear telling, nor could I tell what might be the consequences of it; it was impossible too, without making it public all over the country, as well who I was, as what I now was also.

This perplexity continued a great while, and made my spouse very uneasy; for he thought I was not open with him, and did not let him into every part of my grievance; and he would often say, he wondered what he had done, that I would not trust him, whatever it was, especially if it was grievous and afflicting. The truth is, he ought to have been trusted with everything, for no man could deserve better of a wife; but this was a thing I knew not how to open to him, and yet having nobody to disclose any part of it to, the burden was too heavy for my mind; for let them say what they please of our sex not being able to keep a secret; my life is a plain conviction to me of the contrary; but be it our sex, or the men’s sex, a secret of moment should always have a confidant, a bosom friend, to whom we may communicate the joy of it, or the grief of it, be it which it will, or it will be a double weight upon the spirits, and perhaps become even insupportable in itself; and this I appeal to human testimony for the truth of.

And this is the cause why many times men, as well as women, and men of the greatest and best qualities other ways, yet have found themselves weak in this part, and have not been able to bear the weight of a secret joy, or of a secret sorrow; but have been obliged to disclose it even for the mere giving vent to themselves, and to unbend the mind,oppressed with the weights which attended it; nor was this any token of folly at all, but a natural consequence of the thing; and such people, had they struggled longer with the oppression, would certainly have told it in their sleep, and disclosed the secret, let it have been of what fatal nature soever, without regard to the person to whom it might be exposed. This necessity of nature is a thing which works sometimes with such vehemency in the minds of those who are guilty of any atrocious villainy, such as a secret murder in particular, that they have been obliged to discover it, though the consequence has been their own destruction. Now, though it may be true that the divine justice ought to have the glory of all those discoveries and confessions, yet ’tis as certain that Providence, which ordinarily works by the hands of Nature, makes use here of the same natural causes to produce those extraordinary effects.

I could give several remarkable instances of this in my long conversation with crime, and with criminals. I knew one fellow, that while I was a prisoner in Newgate, was one of those they called then night-fliers. I know not what word they may have understood it by since; but he was one who by connivance was admitted to go abroad every evening, when he played his pranks, and furnished those honest people they call thief-catchers with business to find out the next day, and restore for a reward what they had stolen the evening before. This fellow was as sure to tell in his sleep all that he had done, and every step he had taken, what he had stolen, and where, as sure as if he had engaged to tell it waking, and therefore he was obliged after he had been out to lock himself up, or be locked up by some of the keepers that had him in fee, that nobody should hear him; but, on the other hand, if he had told all the particulars, and given a full account of his rambles and success to any comrade, any brother thief, or to his employers, as I may justly call them, then all was well, and he slept as quietly as other people.

As the publishing this account of my life is for the sake of the just moral of every part of it, and for instruction, caution, warning, and improvement to every reader, so this will not pass, I hope, for an unnecessary digression concerning some people being obliged to disclose the greatest secrets either of their own or other people’s affairs.

Under the oppression of this weight I laboured in the case I have been naming; and the only relief I found for it was to let my husband into so much of it as I thought would convince him of the necessity there was for us to think of settling in some other part of the world; and the next consideration before us was, which part of the English settlements we should go to? My husband was a perfect stranger to the country, and had not yet so much as a geographical knowledge of the situation of the several places; and I, that, till I wrote this, did not know what the word geographical signified, had only a general knowledge from long conversation with people that came from, or went to, several places; but this I knew, that Maryland, Pennsylvania, East and West Jersey, New York, and New England lay all north of Virginia, and that they were consequently all colder climates, to which, for that very reason, I had an aversion; for that as I naturally loved warm weather, so now I grew into years, I had a stronger inclination to shun a cold climate. I therefore considered of going to Carolina, which is the most southern colony of the English on the continent; and hither I proposed to go, the rather, because I might with case come from thence at any time it might be proper to enquire after my mother’s effects, and to demand them.

With this resolution, I proposed to my husband our going away from where we were, and carrying our effects with us to Carolina, where we resolved to settle; for my husband readily agreed to the first part, viz., that it was not at all proper to stay where we was, since I had assured him we should be known there; and the rest I concealed from him.

But now I found a new difficulty upon me. The main affair grew heavy upon my mind still, and I could not think of going out of the country without somehow or other making enquiry into the grand affair of what my mother had done for me; nor could I with any patience bear the thought of going away, and not make myself known to my old husband (brother), or to my child, his son; only I would fain have had it done without my new husband having any knowledge of it, or they having any knowledge of him.

I cast about innumerable ways in my thoughts how this might be done. I would gladly have sent my husband away to Carolina, and have come after myself; but this was impracticable, he would not stir without me, being himself unacquainted with the country, and with the methods of settling anywhere, Then I thought we would both go first, and that when we were settled I should come back to Virginia; but even then I knew he would never part with me, and be left there alone. The case was plain, he was bred a genleman, and was not only unacquainted, but indolent, and when we did settle, would much rather go into the woods with his gun, which they call there hunting, and which is the ordinary work of the Indians; I say, he would much rather do that than attend the natural business of the plantation.

These were, therefore, difficulties unsurmountable, and such as I knew not what to do in. I had such strong impressions on my mind about discovering myself to my old husband, that I could not withstand them;and the rather, because it ran in my thoughts, that if I did not while he lived, I might in vain endeavour to convince my son afterward that I was really the same person, and that I was his mother, and so might both lose the assistance and comfort of the relation, and lose whatever it was my mother had left me; and yet, on the other hand, I could never think it proper to discover the circumstances I was in; as well relating to the having a husband with me, as to my being brought over as a criminal; on both which accounts it wat absolutely necessary to me to remove from the place where I was, and come again to him, as from another place and in another figure.

Upon those considerations I went on with telling my husband the absolute necessity there was of our not settling in Potomac River, that we should presently be made public there, whereas if we went to any other place in the world, we could come in with as much reputation as any family that came to plant; that as it was always agreeable to the inhabitants to have families come among them to plant who brought substance with them, so we should be sure of agreeable reception, and without any possibility of a discovery of our circumstances.

I told him too, that as I had several relations in the place where we were, and that I durst not now let myself be known to them, because they would soon come to know the occasion of my coming over, which would be to expose myself to the last degree; so I had reason to believe that my mother, who died here, had left me something, and perhaps considerable, which it might be very well worth my while to enquire after; but that this too could not be done without exposing us publicly, unless we went from hence; and then, wherever we settled, I might come, as it were, to visit and to see my brother and nephews, make myself known, enquire after what was my due, be received with respect, and, at the same time have justice done me; whereas if I did it now I could expect nothing but with trouble, such as exacting it by force, receiving it with curses and reluctance, and with all kinds of affronts; which he would not perhaps bear to see. That in case of being obliged to legal proofs of being really her daughter I might be at a loss, be obliged to have recourse to England, and, it may be to fail at last and so lose it. With these arguments, and having thus acquainted my husband with the whole secret so far as was needful to him, we resolved to go and seek a settlement in some other colony, and at first Carolina was the place pitched upon.

In order to this we began to make enquiry for vessels going to Carolina, and in a very little while got information that on the other side the Bay, as they call it, viz., in Maryland, there was a ship, which came from Carolina, laaden with rice and other goods, and was going back again thither. On this news we hired a sloop to take in our goods, and taking, as it were, a final farewell of Potomac River, we went with all our cargo over to Maryland.

This was a long and unpleasant voyage, and my spouse said it was worse to him than all the voyage from England, because the weather was bad, the water rough, and the vessel small and inconvenient; in the next place we were full an hundred miles up Potomac River, in a part they call Westmorland County; and as that river is by far the greatest in Virginia, and I have heard say, it is the greatest river in the world that falls into another river, and not directly into the sea; so we had base weather in it, and were frequently in great danger; for though they call it but a river, ’tis frequently so broad, that when we were in the middle, we could not see land on either side for many leagues together. Then we had the great Bay of Chesapeake to cross, which is where the River Potomac falls into it, near thirty miles broad, so that our voyage was full two hundred miles, in a poor, sorry sloop, with all our treasure, and if any accident had happened to us, we might at last have been very miserable; supposing we had lost our goods and saved our lives only, and had then been left naked and destitute, and in a wild, strange place, not having one friend or acquaintance in all that part of the world? The very thoughts of it gives me some horror, even since the danger is past.

Well, we came to the place in five days’ sailing. I think they call it Philip’s Point, and behold when we came thither, the ship bound to Carolina was loaded and gone away but three days before. This was a disappointment, but however, I, that was to be discouraged with nothing, told my husband that since we could not get passage to Carolina, and that the country we were in was very fertile and good; we would see if we could find out anything for our turn where we were, and that if he liked things we would settle here.

We immediately went on shore, but found no conveniences just at that place, either for our being on shore, or preserving our goods on shore, but was directed by a very honest Quaker, who we found there, to go to a place about sixty miles east; that is to say, nearer the mouth of the bay, where, he said, he lived and where we should be accommodated, either to plant, or to wait for any other place to plant in that might be more convenient; and he invited us with so much kindness that we agreed to go and the Quaker himself went with us.

Here we bought us two servants, viz., an Englishwoman servant, just come on shore from a ship of Liverpool, and a negro man-servant, things absolutely necessary for all people that pretended to settle in that country. This honest Quaker was very helpful to us, and when we came to the place that he proposed, found us out a convenient storehouse for our goods, and lodging for ourselves and servants; and about two months, or thereabout, afterwards, by his direction, we took up a large piece of land from the government of that country, in order to form our plantation, and so we laid the thoughts of going to Carolina wholly aside, having been very well received here, and accommodated with a convenient lodging till we could prepare things, and have land enough cured, and materials provided for building us a house, all which we managed by the direction of the Quaker; so that in one year’s time we had near fifty acres of land cleared, part of it enclosed, and some of it planted with tobacco, though not much; besides, we had garden ground and corn sufficient to supply our servants with roots, and herbs, and bread.

And now I persuaded my husband to let me go over the Bay again, and enquire after my friends. He was the willinger to consent to it now, because he had business upon his hands sufficient to employ him, besides his gun to divert him, which they call hunting there, and which he greatly delighted in; and, indeed, we used to look at one another, sometimes with a great deal of pleasure, reflecting how much better that was, not than Newgate only, but than the most prosperous of our circumstances in the wicked trade we had been both carrying on.

Our affair was now in a very good posture. We purchased of the proprietors of the colony as much land for thirty-five pounds, paid in ready money, as would make a sufficient plantation to us as long as we could either of us live; and as for children, I was past anything of that kind.

But our good fortune did not end here. I went, as I have said, over the Bay, to the place where my brother, once a husband, lived; but I did not go to the same village where I was before, but went up another great river, on the east side of the River Potomac, called Rapahannock River, and by this means came on the back of his plantation, which was large, and by the help of a navigable creek that ran into the Rapahannock I came very near it.

I was now fully resolved to go up point-blank to my brother (husband) and to tell him who I was; but not knowing what temper I might find him in, or how much out of temper, rather, I might .make him by such a rash visit, I resolved to write a letter to him first to let him know who I was, and that I was come not to give him any trouble upon the old relation, which I hoped was entirely forgot; but that I applied to him as a sister to a brother, desiring his assistance in the case of that provision which our mother at her decease had left for my support, and which I did not doubt but he would do me justice in, especially considering that I was come thus far to look after it.

I said some very tender, kind things in the letter about his son, which I told him he knew to be my own child, and that as I was guilty of nothing in marrying him any more than he was in marrying me, neither of us having then known our being at all related to one another; so I hoped he would allow me the most passionate desire of once seeing my own and only child, and of showing something of the infirmities of a mother in preserving a violent affection for him who had never been able to retain any thought of me one way or other.

I did believe that having received this letter, he would immediately give it to his son to read; his eyes being, I knew, so dim that he could not see to read it; but it fell out better than so, for as his sight was dim, so he had allowed his son to open all letters that came to his hand for him, and the old gentleman being from home, or out of the way when my messenger came, my letter came directly to my son’s hand, and he opened and read it.

He called the messenger in, after some little stay, and asked him where the person was who gave him that letter? The messenger told him the place, which was about seven miles off. So he bid him stay, and ordering a horse to be got ready, and two servants, away he came to me with the messenger. Let anyone judge the consternation I was in when my messenger came back and told me the old gentleman was not at home, but his son was come along with him, and was just coming up to me. I was perfectly confounded, for I knew not whether it was peace or war, nor could I tell how to behave. However, I had but a very few moments to think, for my son was at the heels of the messenger, and, coming up into my lodgings, asked the fellow at the door something. I suppose it was, for I did not hear it, which was the gentlewoman that sent him? For the messenger said, “There she is, sir,” at which he comes directly up to me, kisses me, took me in his arms, embraced me with so much passion that he could not speak, but I could feel his breast heave and throb like a child that cries, but sobs, and cannot cry it out.

I can neither express or describe the joy that touched my very soul, when I found, for it was easy to discover that part, that he came not as a stranger, but as a son to a mother, and, indeed, a son who had never before known what a mother of his own was; in short, we cried over one another a considerable while, when at last he broke out first, “My dear mother,”says he, “are you still alive? I never expected to have seen your face.” As for me, I could say nothing a great while.

After we had both recovered ourselves a little, and were able to talk, he told me how things stood. He told me he had not showed my letter to his father, or told him any thing about it; that what his grandmother left me was in his hands, and that he would do me justice to my full satisfaction; that as to his father, he was old and infirm both in body and mind; that he was very fretful and passionate, almost blind, and capable of nothing; and he questioned whether he would know how to act in an affair which was of so nice a nature as this; and that therefore he had come himself, as well to satisfy himself in seeing me, which he could not restrain himself from, as also to put it into my power to make a judgment after I had seen how things were, whether I would discover myself to his father, or no.

This was really so prudently, and wisely, managed, that I found my son was a man of sense, and needed no direction from me. I told him I did not wonder that his father was as he had described him, for that his head was a little touched before I went away; and principally his disturbances was, because I could not be persuaded to live with him as my husband after I knew that he was my brother. That as he knew better than I what his father’s present condition was, I should readily join with him in such measures as he would direct. That I was indifferent as to seeing his father, since I had seen him first, and he could not have told me better news than to tell me that what his grandmother had left me was entrusted in his hands, who I doubted not now he knew who I was, would, as he said, do me justice. I enquired then how long my mother had been dead, and where she died, and told so many particulars of the family, that I left him no room to doubt the truth of my being really and truly his mother.

My son then enquired where I was, and how I had disposed myself. I told him I was on the Maryland side of the Bay, at the plantation of a particular friend, who came from England in the same ship with me; that as for that side of the Bay where he was, I had no habitation. He told me I should go home with him, and live with him, if I pleased, as long as I lived; that as to his father, he knew nobody, and would never so much as guess at me. I considered of that a little, and told him that though it was really no little concern to me to live at a distance from him, yet I could not say it would be the most comfortable thing in the world to me to live in the house with him, and to have that unhappy object always before me which had been such a blow to my peace before; that though I should be glad to have his company (my son), or to be as near him as possible, yet I could not think of being in the house where I should be also under constant restraint, for fear of betraying myself in my discourse, nor should I be able to refrain some expressions, in my conversing with him as my son, that might discover the whole affair, which would by no means be convenient.

He acknowledged that I was right in all this. “But then, dear mother,”says he, “you shall be as near me as you can.” So he took me with him on horseback to a plantation, next to his own, and where I was as well entertained as I could have been in his own. Having left me there, he went away home telling me he would talk of the main business the next day, and having first called me his aunt, and given a charge to the people, who, it seems, were his tenants, to treat me with all possible respect. About two hours after he was gone he sent me a maid servant and a negro boy to wait on me, and provisions ready dressed for my supper; and thus I was as if I had been in a new world, and began almost to wish that I had not brought my Lancashire husband from England at all.

However, that wish was not hearty neither, for I loved my Lancashire husband entirely, as I had ever done from the beginning; and he merited it as much as it was possible for a man to do: but that by the way.

The next morning my son came to visit me again almost as soon as I was up. After a little discourse, he first of all pulled out a deerskin bag, and gave it me, with five-and-fifty Spanish pistoles in it, and told me that was to supply my expenses from England, for though it was not his business to enquire, yet he ought to think I did not bring a great deal of money out with me, it not being usual to bring much money into that country. Then he pulled out his grandmother’s will, and read it over to me, whereby it appeared that she left a plantation on York River to me, with the stock of servants and cattle upon it, and had given it in trust to this son of mine for my use, whenever he would hear of me, and to my heirs, if I had any children, and in default of heirs, to whomsoever I should by will dispose of it; but gave the income of it, till I should be heard of, to my said son; and if I should not be living, then it was to him and his heirs.

This plantation, though remote from him, he said he did not let out, but managed it by a head clerk, as he did another that was his father’s,that lay hard by it, and went over himself three or four times a year to look after it. I asked him what he thought the plantation might be worth? He said, if I would let it out, he would give me about sixty pounds a year for it; but if I would live on it, then it would be worth much more, and he believed would bring me in about £150 a year; but seeing I was likely either to settle on the other side the Bay, or might perhaps have a mind to go back to England, if I would let him be my steward he would manage it for me, as he had done for himself, and that he believed he should be able to send me as much tobacco from it as would yield me about a £100 a year, sometimes more.

This was all strange news to me, and things I had not been used to; and really my heart began to look up more seriously than I think it ever did before, and to look with great thankfulness to the hand of Providence, which had done such wonders for me, who had been myself the greatest wonder of wickedness, perhaps, that had been suffered to live in the world; and I must again observe that not on this occasion only, but even on all other occasions of thankfulness, my past wickedness and abominable life never looked so monstrous to me, and I never so completely abhorred it, and reproached myself with it, as when I had a sense upon me of Providence doing good to me, while I had been making those vile returns on my part.

But I leave the reader to improve these thoughts, as no doubt they will see cause, and I go on to the fact; my son’s tender carriage and kind offers fetched tears from me, almost all the while he talked with me; indeed, I could scarce discourse with him but in the intervals of my passion; however, at length I began, and expressing myself with wonder at my being so happy to have the trust of what I had left, put into the hands of my own child, I told him that as to the inheritance of it, I had no child but him in the world, and was now past having any if I should marry, and therefore would desire him to get a writing drawn, which I was ready to execute, by which I would after me give it wholly to him, and to his heirs; and in the meantime smiling, I asked him, what made him continue a bachelor so long? His answer was kind, and ready, that Virginia did not yield any great plenty of wives, and that since I talked of going back to England, I should send him a wife from London.

This was the substance of our first day’s conversation, the pleasantest day that ever passed over my head in my life, and which gave me the truest satisfaction. He came every day after this, and spent a great part of his time with me, and carried me about to several of his friends’ houses, where I was entertained with great respect; also I dined several times at his own house, when he took care always to see his half-dead father so out of the way, that I never saw him, or he me. I made him one present, and it was all I had of value, and that was one of the gold watches, of which, I said, I had two in my chest, and this I happened to have with me, and gave it him at his third visit. I told him I had nothing of any value to bestow but that, and I desired he would now and then kiss it for my sake. I did not indeed tell him that I stole it from a gentlewoman’s side at a meeting house in London, that’s by the way.

He stood a little while hesitating, as if doubtful whether to take it or no; but I pressed it on him, and made him accept it, and it was not much less worth than his leather pouch full of Spanish gold; no, though it were to be reckoned as if at London, whereas it was worth twice as much there. At length he took it, kissed it, told me the watch should be a debt upon him, that he would be paying as long as I lived.

A few days after, he brought the writings of gift, and the scrivener with him, and I signed them very freely, and delivered them to him with a hundred kisses; for sure nothing ever passed between a mother and a tender, dutiful child with more affection. The next day he brings me an obligation under his hand and seal, whereby he engaged himself to manage the plantation for my account, and to remit the produce to my order wherever I should be, and withal, obliged himself to make up the produce a hundred pounds a year to me. When he had done so, he told me that as I came to demand before the crop was off, I had a right to the produce of the current year, and so he paid a hundred pounds in Spanish pieces of eight, and desired me to give him a receipt for it as in full for that year, ending at Christmas following; this being about the latter end of August.

I stayed here above five weeks, and indeed had much ado to get away then. Nay, he would have come over the Bay with me, but I would by no means allow it. However, he would send me over in a sloop of his own, which was built like a yacht, and served him as well for pleasure as business. This I accepted of, and so, after the utmost expressions both of duty and affection, he let me come away, and I arrived safe in two days at my friends the Quakers.

I brought over with me for the use of our plantation three horses, with harness and saddles; some hogs, two cows, and a thousand other things, the gift of the kindest and tenderest child that ever woman had. I related to my husband all the particulars of this voyage, except that I called my son my cousin: and first I told him that I had lost my watch, which he seemed to take as a misfortune; but then I told him how kind my cousin had been, that my mother had left me such a plantation, and that he had preserved it for me, in hopes some time or other he should hear from me. Then I told him that I had left it to his management, that he would render me a faithful account of its produce; and then I pulled him out the hundred pounds in silver, as the first year’s produce, and then pulling out the deerskin purse, with the pistoles, “And here, my dear,” says I, “is the gold watch.”

Says my husband, “So is heaven’s goodness sure to work the same effects, in all sensible minds, where mercies touch the heart;” lifted up both his hands, and with an ecstasy of joy, “What is God a-doing,” says he, “for such an ungrateful dog as I am?”

Then I let him know what I had brought over in the sloop besides all this. I mean the horses, hogs, and cows, and other stores for our plantation; all which added to his surprise, and filled his heart with thankfulness; and from this time forward I believe he was as sincere a penitent, and as thoroughly a reformed man, as ever God’s goodness brought back from a profligate, a highwayman, and a robber. I could fill a larger history than this with the evidences of this truth, and but that I doubt that part of the story will not be equally diverting as the wicked part.

But this is to be my own story, not my husband’s. I return, therefore, to my own part. We went on with our own plantation, and managed it with the help and direction of such friends as we got there, and especially the honest Quaker, who proved a faithful, generous, and steady friend to us; and we had very good success; for having a flourishing stock to begin with, as I have said, and this being now increased by the addition of a hundred and fifty pounds sterling in money, we enlarged our number of servants, built us a very good house, and cured every year a great deal of land. The second year I wrote to my old governess, giving her part with us of the joy of our success, and ordered her how lay out the money I had left with her, which was £250, as above, and to send it to us in goods, which she performed, with her usual kindness and fidelity, and all this arrived safe to us.

Here we had a supply of all sorts of clothes as well for my husband as for myself; and I took especial care to buy for him all those things that I knew he delighted to have; as two good long wigs, two silver-hilted swords, three or four fine fowling pieces, a fine saddle with holsters and pistols, very handsome with a scarlet cloak; and, in a word, everything I could think of to oblige him, and to make him appear, as he really was, a very fine gentleman. I ordered a good quantity of such household stuff as we wanted, with linen for us both. As for myself, I wanted very little of clothes, or linen, being very well furnished before. The rest of my cargo consisted in iron work of all sorts, harness for horses, tools, clothes for servants, and woollen cloth, stuffs, serges, stockings, shoes, hats, and the like, such as servants wear; and whole pieces also to make up for servants, all by direction of the Quaker; and all this cargo arrived safe, and in good condition, with three women servants, lusty wenches which my old governess had picked up for me, suitable enough to the place and to the work we had for them to do, one of which happened to come double, having been got with child by one of the seamen in the ship, as she owned afterwards, before the ship got so far as Gravesend; so she brought us a stout boy, about seven months after our landing.

My husband, you may suppose, was a little surprised at the arriving of this cargo from England, and talking with me one day, after he saw the particulars, “My dear,” says he, “what is the meaning of all this? I fear you will run us too deep in debt. When shall we be able to make returns for it all?”

I smiled, and told him that it was all paid for, and then I told him, that not knowing what might befall us in the voyage, and considering what our circumstances might expose us to, I had not taken my whole stock with me, that I had reserved so much in my friend’s hands, which now we were come over safe, and settled in a way to live, I had sent for, as he might see.

He was amazed, and stood awhile telling upon his fingers, but said nothing. At last he began thus: “Hold, let’s see,” says he, telling upon his fingers still, and first on his thumb, “there’s £246 in money at first, then two gold watches, diamond rings, and plate,” says he, upon the fore-finger, then upon the next finger, “here’s a plantation on York River, a £100 a year, then £150 in money, then a sloop load of horses, cows, hogs, and stores,” and so on to the thumb again; “and now,” says he, “a cargo cost £250 in England, and worth here twice the money.”

“Well,” says I, “what do you make of all that?”

“Make of it?” says he. “Why, who says I was deceived when I married a wife in Lancashire? I think I have married a fortune, and a very good fortune, too,” says he.

In a word, we were now in very considerable circumstances, and every year increasing, for our new plantation grew upon our hands insensibly, and in eight years which we lived upon it we brought it to such a pitch that the produce was at least £300 sterling a year. I mean, worth so much in England.

After I had been a year at home again, I went over the Bay to see my son, and to receive another year’s income of my plantation; and I was surprised to hear, just at my landing there, that my old husband was dead, and had not been buried above a fortnight. This, I confess, was not disagreeable news, because now I could appear as I was in a married condition. So I told my son before I came from him, that I believed I should marry a gentleman who had a plantation near mine; and though I was legally free to marry, as to any obligation that was on me before, yet that I was shy of it, lest the blot should some time or other be revived, and it might make a husband uneasy. My son, the same kind, dutiful and obliging creature as ever, treated me now at his own house, paid me my hundred pounds, and sent me home again loaded with presents.

Sometime after this I let my son know I was married, and invited him over to see us, and my husband wrote a very obliging letter to him also, inviting him to come and see him; and he came, accordingly, some months after, and happened to be there just when my cargo from England came in, which I let him believe belonged all to my husband’s estate, and not to me.

It must be observed that when the old wretch, my brother (husband) was dead, I then freely gave my husband an account of all that affair, and of this cousin, as I called him before, being my own son by that mistaken match. He was perfectly easy in the account, and told me he should have been easy if the old man, as we called him, had been alive. “For,” said he, “it was no fault of yours, nor of his; it was a mistake impossible to be prevented.” He only reproached him with desiring me to conceal it, and to live with him as a wife, after I knew that he was my brother. That, he said, was a vile part. Thus all these little difficulties were made easy, and we lived together with the greatest kindness and comfort imaginable. We are now grown old. I am come back to England, being almost seventy years of age, my husband sixty-eight, having performed much more than the limited terms of my transportation. And now notwithstanding all the fatigues, and all the miseries we have both gone through, we are both in good heart and health. My husband remained there some time after me to settle our affairs, and at first I had intended to go back to him, but at his desire I altered that resolution, and he is come over to England also, where we resolve to spend the remainder of our years in sincere penitence for the wicked lives we have lived.
