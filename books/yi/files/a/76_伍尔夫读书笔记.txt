序：弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫和她的随笔


◎黄梅

弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫（Virginia Woolf，1882～1941）是20世纪最重要的英语作家之一，她在文学写作中取得了令人瞩目的成就。

伍尔夫原名弗吉尼亚·斯蒂芬，出生在伦敦的文学世家。父亲莱斯利·斯蒂芬爵士（1832～1904）是有名的传记作家、学者和编辑。斯蒂芬的原配妻子是名作家萨克雷之女，他们育有一女。弗吉尼亚为续弦夫人所生，而她母亲与斯蒂芬结缡以前也嫁过人并生养了三个孩子。因此，弗吉尼亚有好几个异父或异母的哥哥姐姐。大家庭中兄弟姊妹关系比较复杂，而且有过伤害身心的经历，这些在弗吉尼亚敏感脆弱的心灵上留下了长久的印记。

弗吉尼亚没有正式上过学。她的父母不但为女儿延请了家庭教师，而且亲自主持她的某些科目的学习。此外，由于哈代、罗斯金、梅瑞狄斯、亨利·詹姆斯等一些著名作家和文化人都与她父亲过从甚密，弗吉尼亚可说是在文化精英的圈子里长大的，自幼饱读诗书。父母去世后，她随家人迁居伦敦布鲁姆斯伯里区。弗吉尼亚和姐姐瓦尼莎通过哥哥和弟弟的关系与一批学识卓异的青年才俊（大多毕业于剑桥大学）密切交往，其中包括日后名声远播的小说家爱·摩·福斯特（1879～1970）、画家兼艺术批评家罗杰·弗莱（1866～1934）、作家戴维·加涅特（1892～1981）、利顿·斯特雷奇（1880～1932）、经济学家凯恩斯（1883～1946）等——后来人们习惯于把他们称为“布鲁姆斯伯里文化圈”。自1904年年底起，弗吉尼亚的文章开始见诸报刊。在她本人的印象中，所得第一笔稿费为l镑10先令6便士。她用这笔小小的收入买了只波斯猫，并且（如她自己后来所说）变得“有点雄心勃勃”，萌生了写小说的念头。1912年她和批评家兼经济学家伦纳德·伍尔夫（1880～1969）结婚。伍尔夫夫妇为了支持严肃文学而在1917年创办了霍加思出版社，出版社的办公室很快就成为青年作家的聚会地点。T．S．艾略特说：弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫“不是一伙初出茅庐的试笔者的核心，而是伦敦文学生活的中心”。

但是这种生活也极大地耗费了伍尔夫的体力和心力。第一次世界大战的爆发使她忧虑重重，更深地陷入了精神病态。她并没有因为不时发病而中止写作。小说处女作《远航》于1915年问世，描写一个英国姑娘赴南美洲的经历；此后，她又陆续完成了《夜与昼》（1919）和《雅各的房间》（1922）。后者描写几名亲友来到一位在大战中阵亡的青年的房间，睹物伤情，从各自的角度追思逝者。该书题材的选取显然与作者对自己英年早逝的哥哥索比的印象相关。小说的内容在很大程度上仍是写实的，却采用了间接叙述的方法和浓烈的印象主义风格，引起文坛的注意。这部小说和稍先于它出版的短篇集《星期一或星期二》（1921）标志着作者在主题和技巧上的新尝试。

20世纪前期是西方文化发生某种转变的时刻。在20年代，伍尔夫加入了批评传统写实手法的论战。她嘲笑阿·本涅特（1867～1931）、赫·乔·威尔斯（1866～1946）、高尔斯华绥（1867～1933）等关注“讲故事”的作家“偏重物质”的描写手法，认为它只触及表象。同时，她赞扬了“不顾一切地去揭示内心最深处火焰的闪光”的戴·赫·劳伦斯（1885～1930）、多萝西·理查逊（1873～1957）、乔伊斯（1882～1941）等人。她主张表现人的头脑在日常生活中每时每刻接受的“千千万万的印象”。这与洛克、休谟的英国经验主义传统是一脉相承的。当时一些欧陆作家的作品对她也多有启发。大约在1922年前后她读了普鲁斯特的《追忆似水年华》并参与了陀思妥耶夫斯基作品的翻译工作，她盛赞这些作家重视表现人的内心，“所写的一切彻底地纯粹地关乎心灵”。

1925年出版的《达洛维夫人》充分体现了伍尔夫的艺术追求。这部小说被认为是“意识流”小说的代表作之一。在《达洛维夫人》一书中可明显辨认出乔伊斯的小说《尤利西斯》（1922）的影响。它包括两条平行的叙事线索，分别记述属于上层社会的达洛维夫人和因战争经历而精神失常的下层职员、退伍兵塞·史密斯一天的生活。这种“生活”完全是通过人物——特别是达洛维夫人——的内心活动来表现的，可以说是由内及外，主要借助时间（以伦敦大本钟的报时钟声为标志）的分割来组织空间的转换。两个中心人物的生活轨迹并无交叉点。作为议员太太的达洛维夫人从容出入于热闹街头或豪华住所，筹办晚会、处理家务或沉思休憩。她与蜗居陋室、生活无着的史密斯毫无关联，只是在小说结尾时，她听一位前来参加晚会的客人偶然提到小人物史密斯的自杀。这一消息深深触动了她心中的某种恐惧和焦虑。虽然从表面看，两个中心人物像是生活在截然不同的天地里，但是他们却又共同经历着多少相似并相关的精神危机，即对英国社会所代表的世界秩序以及对人生价值含有绝望意味的怀疑与追问。两年后完成的《到灯塔去》（1927）也常被看作是作者最优秀的作品。小说的三个部分犹如三个乐章，描述拉姆齐一家在海滨别墅的经历和体验。无私的拉姆齐夫人是秩序与和谐的化身：她照料孩子、帮助客人、鼓励丈夫。她许诺要带小儿子去看灯塔却未能实现。后来发生了战争，战争带来了死亡和衰败。多年后小儿子长大成人，终于和父亲一起去参观了灯塔，他们所感悟到的，是已故拉姆齐夫人某种照耀心灵之光。对于他们的朋友女画家莉丽，这一段经历变成了艺术的灵感。这部作品之所以具有特殊的感人力量，恐怕不在于艺术上的精心营造，而在于字里行间流露出的对中心人物的某种深刻理解和真挚感情——伍尔夫本人说，拉姆齐夫人是以她的母亲为原型的。

继这两部成功的“实验”小说后，伍尔夫一直没有中断各类虚构作品的写作。《奥兰多》（1928）是一部独特的戏拟作品，作者让那位时而男身、时而女身的主人公一活就是几百年——从伊丽莎白女王统治的时代一直到20世纪，历经近、现代英国社会文化生活的种种变迁。随后又有《海浪》和《岁月》分别于1931年和1937年与读者见了面。不幸的是，自母亲去世后，自幼体弱的伍尔夫一直断断续续地受到神经系统病症的侵扰。小说《幕间》完稿时，第二次世界大战的战火正在蔓延。伍尔夫在重重内外压力下感觉自己精神濒临崩溃，未能等到《幕间》出版（1941年7月），就在离家不远的地方投水自尽了。

伍尔夫的小说富于诗情乐感，在文体和结构安排上都煞费苦心，为小说的革新和发展做出了重要的贡献，她的意识流笔法也被广泛模仿和移植。尽管如此，仍有许多人更偏爱她的短小散文。本书译者之一刘炳善教授认为，至少在中国，伍尔夫的散文可能比她的小说拥有更多的读者和更大的影响。笔者也赞成这种看法。

在20世纪前期诸多从事英语散文（Essay）写作的人当中，弗吉尼亚·伍尔夫是最引人注目者之一。如果说她的小说在某种程度上是写给小说家的，刻意雕琢的痕迹较重，她的散文书话则如她一个文集的标题所示，大抵是作为“普通读者”并且为了“普通读者”而写就，行文深入浅出，从容幽默，绝少学究气，令人耳目一新。她是20世纪英语散文创作的杰出代表，也是第一位取得了与哈兹利特们“平起平坐”地位的女性随笔写家。

伍尔夫的散文可大致分为三类。第一类是涉及个人生活经历和体验的短文。伍尔夫不断试探文学体裁的边界，不愿做形式和规则的囚徒。在文字的星空，她有意识地自由放飞心灵，无拘无束地徜徉于虚构与非虚构、诗歌与散文之间。这些短文既含对世界和生命本质的思辨，也描绘了小小的一景一物。文字清新，娓娓道来，仿佛作者静坐在一旁，等待着读者的心与自己共同颤动那一刻。

第二类为有关文学、文学理论、作家和作品的感想和评论，也即我们所说的“书话”。这是伍尔夫散文的大端，也是本书遴选的重点。伍尔夫曾为不少文学期刊做特约撰稿人，她的很多文章最初刊于《泰晤士报文学增刊》、《耶鲁评论》、《大西洋月刊》等重要报章杂志，后来才陆续收入文集。其中《普通读者》（一、二集）在她生前已经问世，还有一些则是在她去世后由她丈夫伦纳德搜集编辑成书的。在这类文章中，《班奈特先生和布朗太太》、《现代小说》等面世之时就对创作界有相当的影响，而今己成为了解研究20世纪前期小说艺术的必读名篇。她对作家的评议和介绍往往独具慧眼，亦庄亦谐，精彩纷呈。值得着重说明的是，这些评说常常对传统有所突破，在被湮没的历史幽暗地带挖掘思想或艺术的珍宝。比如，在纪念家喻户晓的名著《鲁滨孙漂流记》问世200年的文章里，伍尔夫却浓墨重彩地讨论了作者另外两部以女性为主人公的小说。她的努力不但拓展了同代人的眼界，修养了他们的心性，也为文学史的改造投入了一己之力。

伍尔夫的第三类散文是有关妇女问题的文字。她被不少后来的女权、女性主义者看作是卓有成就的前驱者。她的闻名遐迩的小册子《自己的一间屋》出版于1929年，是根据她本人以《妇女和小说》为题在剑桥大学纽纳姆学院和格顿学院所做的两个报告而撰成。该书深入讨论了历代妇女在社会、经济和教育诸方面受到的歧视、排斥和压抑，回顾并高度评价了女性文学的传统。伍尔夫还进一步论证说，妇女必须享有隐私权和经济独立，才能自由并出色地写作。她追述了英国女性数百年来涉足写作的艰难历程，虚构了莎士比亚妹妹的遭遇。这本书打动了一代又一代知识妇女的心。固然，伍尔夫所关心的主要是中上阶级受过教育的女性。她曾就当时出版的一本工人妇女纪事集感叹说，像她这类人不摸洗衣盆也不切肉，不可能了解劳动妇女的处境。不过，虽说有这样那样的局限，《自己的一间屋》及其姊妹篇《三枚金币》（1938）有关妇女性别角色的言说的确产生了深远的影响，是女权运动的经典之作。它们既推动女性自觉意识的觉醒，又主张更上层楼地超越女性意识。所探讨的问题至今没有过时。

当然，上述第二类和第三类文章多有重合——因为任何区隔划分都不是绝对的。伍尔夫对许多名不见经传的女性作家的亲切描述和中肯议论常常是她最优秀而有趣的篇什，构成了她的书话的“半壁江山”。

本书撷选了伍尔夫散文中一些有代表性的篇目或章节，以议论英语文学作品和作家的书话为主，也兼收若干抒情、记事或论争的文字。伍尔夫的散文虽然平易近人，但是翻译起来还是有相当难度的。这主要是因为她对英国历史文化往事徐徐道来、如数家珍。语间又多含揶揄嘲讽，译者实在难以一一钩沉索隐，理解起来难免会有偏差，更遑论在不同的语言文化系统中找到恰如其分的对应表达。此外，她的风格比较口语化，却又不属于市井语言，而是大量采用一种知识女性信马由缰、边思边说的长句型。因而，译者在把握文体时会常常感到进退两难；不同译者在具体处理中分寸也必有差异。尽管译者都勉力求“信”，译文仍不可避免有错漏或不妥之处，还恳望读者批评指正。





笛福(1)


撰文纪念各种百周年的人有时不免忧虑，害怕自己是在评价一个日渐凋萎的幽魂且不得不预言它那正在迫近的彻底消逝；不过，谈论《鲁滨逊漂流记》这种担心就全然不必，连如此想一想都十分荒唐。的确，到1919年4月25日，《鲁滨逊漂流记》就问世200年了，然而根本没有引发人们是否还读它、是否还将继续读它这类常见的猜想，200周年纪念日的效果是让我们惊叹永恒而不朽的《鲁滨逊漂流记》竟然才仅仅存在了这么短一段时间。那本书不像是单一作者的努力成果，更像整个民族孕育出的无具名之作；庆贺它的百年生日，简直就如为巨石阵(2)举行百年纪念。类似的感受可以归因于我们都曾在童年时代听人朗读《鲁滨逊漂流记》的故事，因而，笛福和他的故事对于我们，几乎就像荷马之于希腊人。我们从来不曾想到真的有个人叫笛福，若是有人说《鲁滨逊漂流记》是某个摇笔杆的人编出来的，要么会引起我们的不快，要么对我们来说毫无意义。童年的印象存留得最久，也刻印得最深。至今，我们仍觉得丹尼尔·笛福的名字似乎没有资格出现在《鲁滨逊漂流记》的书名页上，而且，纪念该书问世200周年，不过是在轻描淡写并且毫无必要地提一句它仍旧存在着，就像巨石阵。

那本书享誉天下，后果却对作者不太公平；因为这虽然使他隐姓埋名地领受了莫大荣光，却多少掩盖了他作为作家还曾写过其他作品这一事实，而其他那些书，可以肯定地说，在我们小时候没有人大声读给我们听。因此，1870年《基督教世界》的编辑呼吁“全英格兰的男孩和女孩们”为被闪电击中损毁的笛福墓重修墓碑之际，大理石碑上仅仅刻着“纪念《鲁滨逊漂流记》的作者”，根本没有提《摩尔·弗兰德斯》。考虑到《摩尔》一书——还有《罗克萨娜》《辛格尔顿船长》《杰克上校》(3)等——的题材，不提它们我们倒也不奇怪，但是却不能不为这种遗漏感到气愤。如笛福的传记作者莱特(4)先生所说，那些书都“不适于摆到客厅的桌子上”。不过，除非我们想让那件十分有用的家具当趣味的最终裁决者，否则就不能不感到痛惜，因为那些作品的表面的粗鄙，或许还加上对《鲁滨逊漂流记》的普遍赞赏，使得它们没能如理所应当的那样享有更大的声誉。在任何可以算是当之无愧的相关纪念碑上，至少《摩尔·弗兰德斯》和《罗克萨娜》的篇名应该和笛福的名字同样被深深刻下。它们位居少数被我们称之为无可争议的伟大作品之列。纪念它们更出名的同伴(5)问世200周年的契机也应该引导我们思考：它们与后者相似的伟大之点究竟何在。

笛福转而开始写小说时已经是六旬老者，那是在理查逊和菲尔丁(6)动笔之前很多年，实际上他是促成小说诞生并把它送上发展之路的首创者之一。没有必要详细论证他的先驱地位，只需说明他开始写小说之初已经对这门艺术有了若干设想，它们部分得自于他本人作为最早小说写者之一的亲身体验。小说要讲述真实故事并传达正确的教诲，才有存在的价值。“编造故事无疑是最骇人听闻的罪过，”他写道，“那是一种会在心灵中豁开大洞的撒谎行径，而后说谎的习惯就会渐渐乘虚而入。”因此，在一部部作品的前言里或正文中，他总是不厌其烦地强调自己从不臆造，而彻头彻尾依据事实，他一心记挂的是让邪恶者悔改、让无辜者警惕的高洁道德意图。幸运的是，这些原则与他的性情和天赋十分相合。先于把经验转述进小说，60年人生变幻早已把种种世态刻进了他的身心。“不久前我曾用这两句诗总结自己一生的缤纷场景，”他写道：

没有人曾经更多体尝莫测的命运，

我十三次发财致富而又沦落赤贫。

写《摩尔·弗兰德斯》之前，他曾在新门监狱被囚了18个月，曾和窃贼、海盗、路匪，以及造假币的犯人聊过天。不过，由于生活经历和事件发生而不得不面对某些事实是一回事，贪婪地吞咽世相真情并铭刻在心又是另一回事。笛福不仅曾亲历贫穷困境，与深受其害的人交谈，而且对他来说，那种衣食不保、风雨无遮、艰难辗转的生活激发出的想象，正是他的艺术的最适当题材。他的杰出小说每每在开头几页里就让男女主人公陷入孤立无援的不幸处境，让他们的生存只能是持续的挣扎奋斗，就连能够活下来也是运气和奋斗的结果。摩尔·弗兰德斯生在新门监狱，母亲是罪犯；辛格尔顿船长童年时被人偷走卖给了吉卜赛人；杰克上校虽然“出身于绅士家庭，却成了窃贼的徒弟”；罗克萨娜开始时运气稍好，但是15岁结婚后却眼看着丈夫破了产，自己拖着五个孩子，陷入“无可言状无比悲惨的境地”。

于是这些男孩女孩们个个都得独自闯世界，都得艰苦奋战。这种境遇完全是按笛福的偏好编排出来的。他们中最突出的一位，即摩尔·弗兰德斯，从一出生至多不过暂缓了半年时间，就落入了“贫困——那最坏的恶鬼”的魔掌，自打学会做针线活儿就被迫自力谋生，奔走四方，她并不向其创造者索求他所不能提供的雅致家庭氛围，却从他那里获取了他所熟知的各式各样奇人异习。从一开始，她就被压上了必须证明自身存在权利的重负。她必须完全依靠自己的智慧和判断，必须用她依据亲身经验在一己头脑中打造出的某些粗糙道德规则来应对各种突发紧急情况。她年纪轻轻就已违背了世俗公认的律法，此后便一直享受着法外之人的自由．而故事的轻快活泼在很大程度上正来源于此。对她来说唯一不可能的事便是安享舒适宁和的生活。不过从一开始，作者的特殊天才就在发挥作用，从而避开了冒险小说套路的明显陷阱。他让我们明白，摩尔是有自身价值的女人，而不仅仅是一系列历险经验的载体。作为证明，摩尔和罗克萨娜一样，在人生开局之际就激情四溢地坠入情网，尽管运气不是太好。她后来不得不重整旗鼓，另与他人结婚并仔细检点婚约条款带给她的钱财和前景，这应当归因于她的身世，而非她对热烈情感的轻视。此外，像所有笛福笔下的女人，摩尔具备健全有力的头脑。如果有利于实现自己的目的，她会毫不犹豫地说谎，正因如此，当她讲真话时便有某种不容否定的气势。她不能在细腻精微的个人情感上浪费时间，不过掉一滴眼泪，伤心片刻，然后“故事就接着发展下去”了。她的心灵热爱迎风沐雨。她喜欢运用发挥自己的能力。当她发现自己在北美弗吉尼亚所嫁的男人竟是自己的弟弟时，不由得深感厌恶，坚决要求离开他；然而，一旦抵达英国的布里斯托尔港，她立刻就“上巴思城去寻欢作乐，因为我离年老还远着呢，我原本就性情快活，这时更是登峰造极”。她并不冷酷无情，也没有人能指责她轻佻放纵；不过，她爱生活，而一位生气勃勃的女主人公自然让我们相随不舍。还有，她的抱负不无创造性想象，使之可以被归为高贵的激情。迫于处境，她不得不算计精明而讲求实用，但是她又时时被对于浪漫爱情及她所认定的绅士品质的渴念所困扰。摩尔哄骗一位拦路打劫的强盗，让他以为自己很有钱。“他具有货真价实的骑士精神，这让我更觉得悲哀，”她这样写道，“比起被无赖小人坑害，栽在讲求荣誉的君子之手多少也算一种安慰。”与这般性情一脉相承，她和最后一位男性伴侣抵达美洲种植园以后，那位先生拒不从事劳作，一心热衷游猎，摩尔对此却颇感骄傲，她很高兴地为他购买假发和镀银的剑，“好让他显得风度翩翩，他也本来就是位优雅绅士”。她对热天气的喜爱也与此呼应，还有她亲吻儿子踩踏过的土地的那股热乎劲儿，以及她对各种过失的大度宽容——只要那过失“不属于彻底的卑鄙，占上风时冷酷无情，专横残忍；处逆境时又垂头丧气，意志消沉”。对世间其他一切，她唯有善意。

上述清单并不能囊括这位见多识广的老罪人的所有特征和妙处，因而我们很可以理解，为什么博罗(7)笔下那伦敦桥上卖苹果的女贩称摩尔为“得神佑的玛丽”，并把她看得比自家摊上全部苹果更宝贵；为什么博罗拿起那本书钻进小铺会一口气读到两眼生疼。我们详述那些性格表征，不过是要证明摩尔·弗兰德斯的创造者并非像有人指责的那样只是个记者，只是事件的忠实记录人，对人的心理缺乏理解。的确，他的人物都自主地成型并充实，似乎并不顺从作者的安排且未必合他的爱好。他从不驻步逗留、详细描述某一微妙体验或情愫，而是不动声色地讲下去，仿佛那些体验和情感都是在他不知晓的情况下出现的。在有些场合，比如那位王公坐在儿子摇篮边，罗克萨娜说他是多么“喜欢看熟睡的孩子”，彼情彼景蕴含的想象魅力似乎对于我们比对他更有意味。笛福说，人必须至少向一位他者吐诉心中大事，否则他就会像新门监狱里的那名囚犯一样在梦里说出来。发表了这一段奇特的现代言说后，他又为自己的离题话道歉。他似乎已把人物深深纳入自己头脑，不经意间又把自己投入了他们的人生；而且，如所有不自觉的艺术家，笛福在作品里留下的真金远远多于他那一代人能打捞出水面的宝贝。

因此，我们对他笔下人物的阐释很可能会令他惊诧。我们阐发的某些含义是他精心掩饰的，甚至是他自己不愿直面的。结果是我们对摩尔·弗兰德斯的赞赏多于责备。我们无法相信，笛福对摩尔到底有多大程度的罪这个问题上拿定了主张，或者他会全然没有意识到自己在考量那些法外之徒的生活时提出了许多深刻问题，并且暗示了——即使没有明说——与他宣称的信仰相违的种种答案。从他《论妇女教育》一文提供的证据，我们可以知道他曾就有关问题深入思考，并走在了时代的前面，他高度估量女性能力并严厉批判妇女遭受的不公待遇。

我常想，在我们这样一个文明的基督教国家，居然不让女性得到求学的益处，真是最最野蛮的习俗之一。我们天天责备女人愚笨无礼，然而，我相信，如果她们有机会受到和我们同等的教育，她们一定会比我们更少犯这类过错。(8)

女性权益的倡导者恐怕不会乐意让摩尔·弗兰德斯和罗克萨娜做她们的主保圣徒；不过，很显然笛福不仅让她们道出了有关妇女问题的一些非常现代的观念，而且把她们置身于一定情境里，使读者对她们的特殊困窘萌生同情。摩尔说，女人需要的是勇气，还有“立稳脚跟”的能力，而且立刻举出实例说明那样行事所能带来的好处。她的同行罗克萨娜女士则更细致地论说抗议婚姻的奴役。她“开创了世间前所未有的一种做法”，书中那位商人对她说，即“辩争反对通行方式”。不过，笛福是最少生硬说教的作家。罗克萨娜让我们始终关注，是因为她得天独厚，浑然不觉自己可以正经八百地充任女性之代表，因此无拘无束地说，她的言谈中“有一些高谈阔论，可它们起初压根没在我脑子里出现”。她意识到自己的弱点，这又导致她诚实地盘诘自己的动机，由此而来的幸运后果就是，当许多问题小说中的献身者和先驱者都早已凋残皱缩成陈列展示思想信条的什物器具之时，罗克萨娜仍能鲜活如初，富于人情。

然而，笛福令我们赞叹的原因并不在于我们可以证明他是梅瑞狄斯某些观点的先导，或者曾经描写过可以被放进易卜生戏剧的某些场景，虽说这类怪异念头确实出现过。不论他对妇女地位问题有什么看法，都不过是他主要优点的偶然附产品，那优点即关注事物的重要而恒久的方面，而不津津乐道于转瞬即逝或细枝末节的事。他写东西常常平淡无奇。他能模仿科考旅行者一五一十照实记录的笔调，到头来我们不得不暗叹：他的笔竟能描述、他的头脑竟能构思那些甚至无法用报告事实真相之类的借口降解其枯燥的内容。他对自然植物界不闻不问，对人性的很大一部分也不曾涉及。这些我们都承认，不过我们同时也得承认，在许多被我们称之为伟大的作家身上也有诸多同样严重的缺陷。然而缺陷并不能损害笛福已有文字的特殊优点。他从一开始就限制了自己的写作范围，界定了他的抱负，因而他达至了某种洞察之真理，远比他本人号称要宣示的事实真相更为珍稀难得、历久弥新。摩尔·弗兰德斯和她的伙伴们尤其得到笛福关注，并不是因为她们如我们可能会说的那样是“形象生动跃然纸上”；也不是像他本人所声言，因为她们是罪恶生涯的例证，可让公众从中得到警示。令他兴趣盎然的是艰难生活在她们身心中培育出的自然的求实态度。她们没有辩解之词，没有仁慈地掩饰遮蔽其动机。贫穷是她们的监工，对于她们的过失，笛福只不过做了一点敷衍了事的评判。而她们的勇敢无畏、足智多谋和百折不挠却让他喜爱不已。他感到，她们在群体交往中妙语接连出现，精彩故事不断上演，彼此讲究信义，有一种土生土长的道德观念。她们的命运变幻多端，对此他频加赞赏，细细体味，而且对本人经历中的类似人生沉浮曾凝神审看、感慨系之。此外，这些男人和女人都自由舒展地公开谈论自开天辟地以来一直驱动着天下众人的激情和欲望，因此至今这些人物仍保持鲜活，生气不减。任何事物，只要被直面正视，都有某种尊严。甚至在摩尔等人经历中占据重要位置的卑下的金钱话题，一旦它代表的不是舒适与排场，而是荣誉、诚实和生活本身，也就不再卑下，相反可能成为悲剧。你可以反驳说笛福的作品单调乏味，却绝不能说他孜孜关注的事物琐屑无聊。

的确，笛福隶属于那一类伟大的平铺直叙者，其作品以对人性中最持续长存因素的深入了解为基础，尽管那些成分未必最夺目诱人。从亨格福德桥望去，伦敦的景象是灰蒙蒙的，严峻的，沉重的，充满车马行人、买卖交易压抑着的律动，若不是有舰船的桅杆和市区的钟楼和穹顶，一切就会显得平庸乏味，这景象令人想到笛福。手捧紫罗兰花站在街角处的衣衫褴褛的卖花姑娘，在拱门遮蔽下耐心兜售火柴和鞋带的饱经风霜的老女人，仿佛都是他笔下的人物。他属于克雷布(9)还有吉辛(10)那一脉，但不仅仅是在同一严苛社会课堂里受教的学友，更是同一写作流派的奠基者和大师。

简·奥斯汀(1)


若是遂了卡桑德拉·奥斯汀小姐(2)的心愿，简·奥斯汀写的东西，除了几本小说以外，我们很可能就什么也见不到了。简只有在给她姐写信时才毫无顾忌；她只向姐姐坦陈心底的希冀以及她人生中的那次大失意——如果传言属实的话。可是，当卡桑德拉·奥斯汀小姐步入老境，她妹妹已经颇有名气，她疑心将来会有生人钻营打探，会有学者胡猜乱想，于是便忍痛焚烧了所有可能满足他们好奇心的书简，只留下一些她以为无关紧要或没人感兴趣的信件。

因此，我们对简·奥斯汀的了解就只能来自一鳞半爪的闲言碎语、为数不多的书信和她的小说。说到闲言碎语，凡能流传下来的街谈巷议都绝不可以轻视；只要对之稍加整理它们就能很有成效地帮助我们。比如说，小费拉德尔菲亚·奥斯汀这样评论自己的表妹：简“算不上漂亮，还一本正经，不像12岁的小姑娘……又刁钻任性又装腔作势”。我们还有米特福德小姐，奥斯汀姐妹年纪轻轻时她就认识她俩，她认为简是“她记忆中一心要捕捉丈夫的最俊俏、最傻气、最做作的浮浪花蝴蝶”。再次，还有米特福德小姐那没有留下姓名的朋友，“她目前正在简那儿做客，说简如今变得古板，成了古往今来最僵挺笔直、一丝不苟、沉默寡言的‘单身福女’，而且，若不是《傲慢与偏见》揭示出在那僵硬匣子里藏着多么珍贵的宝石，她在社交圈里不会比拨火棍或挡火屏更引人注意……现在情况当然大不相同了，”那位淑媛接着说，“她仍然是拨火棍——不过如今是人人害怕的拨火棍……不声不响，闷头摹写人物的才女，着实叫人害怕！”另一方面，当然了，还有奥斯汀一家，他们很少自夸自赞，尽管如此，据说兄弟们都“非常喜爱简，都因她而自豪。他们喜欢她的才气、她的美德和她讨人喜欢的风度。每个人后来都乐于在某个侄女或自家女儿身上发现与亲爱的姐妹简有几分相似的地方，但是若说到堪与简比肩媲美的人，他们压根就没指望能够再见到”。可爱迷人却又僵挺笔直，在家里受宠爱却被外人惧怕，刀子嘴豆腐心——这些相反的特征并非不能调和共存，当我们转而阅览奥斯汀的小说时，也会在故事中跌跌绊绊地碰上同样的复杂性，一如解读作者本人。

首先，被费拉德尔菲亚认定不像12岁孩子的那个又任性又做作的小姑娘很快成了女写家，完成了一篇毫不孩子气的令人惊讶的故事，即《爱情与友谊》(3)。虽说似乎有点难以置信，该作品写于作者15岁之时。很显然，写它是为了让家庭教室里的诸君取乐，抄在同一册的故事中有一篇以搞笑的庄重口吻献给她哥哥；还有一篇由姐姐配上了笔触简洁的水彩头像插图。人们会觉得，有些玩笑是全家人的共有财富，有些讽刺力道十足，是因为全体小奥斯汀都嘲笑“在沙发上叹息并昏厥”的优雅淑女。

兄弟姐妹们一致对某些陋习表示厌恶，当奥斯汀大声朗读她对这些恶俗的最后致命攻击时，大家肯定曾一道开怀畅笑：“失去奥古斯塔斯都真让我伤心备至，终为悲恸而献身。一次致命的晕厥让我一命归西。可得警惕晕厥呀，亲爱的劳拉……如果你愿意，尽管发疯好了，但是不要晕倒……”如此这般，尽自己写字的速度，甚至比拼读发音还要快，她急匆匆地讲述那些不可思议的冒险故事，关于劳拉和索菲亚，关于菲兰德和古斯塔夫，关于每隔一天就驱车来往于爱丁堡和斯特灵两地间的那位绅士，关于藏在桌子抽屉内大笔财物的失窃，还有食不果腹的妈妈们和扮演麦克白(4)的儿子们。毫无疑问，那些故事曾让教室里哄堂大笑。然而，最明显不过，坐在客厅僻静一角的15岁姑娘提笔并不是为了博兄弟姐妹一笑，不是为了让自家人享用。她写达西是为所有人，又不为任何人，是为我们的时代，也为她自己的时代；换言之，尽管那时奥斯汀不过小小年纪，却已经名副其实是在从事写作。从她那些节奏鲜明、匀称齐整、严谨有序的文句，我们可以听出这一点。“她是个脾气好、懂礼貌、善迎合的年轻姑娘，人们没法讨厌这样的人——她不过是招人蔑视而已。”如此这般的句子原是打算要存活得比那段圣诞节期更长久的。活泼，轻快，妙趣横生，自由无羁到戏谑恶搞的地步——《爱情与友谊》具备上述所有特点，然而，那贯穿全书、不曾消融于其他种种之中的独特声音又是什么？是笑的声音。15岁的女孩在其小小一隅嘲笑全世界。

寻常15岁姑娘们笑口常开。宾尼先生想加糖却错拿了咸盐，她们开心失笑。汤姆金斯老太一屁股坐到猫身上，她们几乎笑得接不上气了。不过，没一会儿，她们却又哭了。她们没有固定的立足之点，不能从那里四下环顾，看出人类天性中有永远可笑的东西，看出世间男男女女身上有某些特质总能引发讥嘲。她们不知道轻侮别人的格雷维尔夫人和被轻侮的可怜的玛丽是每间舞厅里恒久的景象。但是简·奥斯汀一出生就知道这些。肯定有某位守护摇篮的仙女在她出生之后立刻带她到世界上转了一遭。当她被重新放回摇篮的时候，她不仅知道了世界是什么样子，而且还选择了自己的王国。她应许，倘若她能统治那片疆土，就不再觊觎其他领地。因此，到了15岁，奥斯汀对他人已不存多少幻想，对自己更是全无妄念。不论她写什么，都是十足成品，都不只是着眼于诉诸自家牧师宅里的各位，而是面向全世界并与整个世界相关。她客观超然，难以参透。当写家简·奥斯汀在该书最出彩的人物素描段落中记述格雷维尔夫人的言谈时，措辞丝毫不含对轻侮言行的愤恨。尽管作为牧师的女儿，简·奥斯汀曾亲身体尝被人仗势轻侮的滋味儿。她把目光径直投向了目标，而且我们准确地知道那目标位于人类天性地图上的哪一个点。我们能知道，是因为简·奥斯汀严格地遵守了约定，她从未越界。即使是在感情冲动的15岁，她也从不曾心怀羞耻地掉头自我攻击，从不因一时怜悯而摘去讥讽的利刺，从未在激情的迷氛中模糊了描画的线条。“一时的感奋与热狂，”她似乎手持魔术棒指点着说，“在那里结束。”分界线清清楚楚。当然她不否认月亮、山岭和城堡是存在的——在界线的另一边。她甚至创作了自己的浪漫传奇。那是关于苏格兰女王(5)的故事。奥斯汀确实景仰那位女王。“世上第一等的人物，”她评说道，“令人着迷的公主，她当年唯一的朋友是诺福克公爵，如今仅有的朋友便是惠特克先生、勒弗罗伊太太、奈特太太(6)和我啦。”通过这样的词句，她的激情利利索索地得到了控制，并被笑声包裹起来。如果对照一下不久后勃朗特姊妹在北方她们家牧师宅里写威灵顿公爵(7)时的遣词用语，是很有兴味的事。

一本正经的小姑娘长大了。她成了米特福德太太记忆中那“一心要捕捉丈夫的最俊俏、最傻气、最做作的浮浪花蝴蝶”；后来，还瞎蒙乱撞地成了一本名为《傲慢与偏见》的小说的作者。文稿是在一扇吱扭作响的房门掩护之下偷偷写成的，后来一放多年未能出版。据说，她不久后即开始动笔写另一篇故事，即《瓦森一家》，由于某些原因不大满意，就没有写完。不过，大作家的二流作品值得一读，因为它们为其名篇杰作提供了最佳评注。

在《瓦森一家》中，奥斯汀遇到的困难更显露无余，而她克服困难的手段却没有被那么巧妙地遮掩。首先，开头几章生硬粗略，说明她属于那类习惯在第一稿里简单陈列事实梗概的作者，此后他们会一次又一次地回过头去扩展加工，充实血肉，营造氛围。过程到底如何我们说不上来——我们不知道作者扣除了什么，加添了什么，运用了哪些艺术手法。但总而言之，奇迹发生了，14年平淡无味的家庭生活被转化成看似毫无雕琢的精妙序篇；我们绝猜不到此前奥斯汀曾迫使她的笔做了多少苦工。由此我们觉察到奥斯汀根本不是魔术家。像其他写手一样，她得创造某种气氛，好让自己特有的天分能开花结果。在这里她摸索探寻；她让我们等待。突然间她大功告成，于是事态按照她的意愿步步推进了。爱德华一家要去参加舞会。汤姆林森家的马车正好路过；她告诉我们，家人给查尔斯“备了手套并吩咐他好好戴着”；汤姆·马斯格雷夫带着一大桶牡蛎退居偏远一隅，而且非常舒心自在。作者的天分得到了解放并十分活跃。我们的感觉立刻敏锐起来，我们被唯有奥斯汀才能赋予的那种特殊的紧张焦灼之感所裹挟。然而那又是由什么构成的呢？只是乡村小镇里的一场舞会，几对舞伴见见面拉拉手，外加吃点喝点什么；其中的重大事件，不过是一名小男孩受到某年轻小姐的冷落却得到了另一位的善待。没有悲剧也没有英雄主义。然而不知为什么这个小小场面十分动人，其感染力与场景庄重严肃的表象很不相称。奥斯汀让我们看出，如果爱玛在舞会厅里表现得如此这般，那么她在更严峻的生活危机中被挚诚之心所驱策，将会何等善解人意又怎样满腔柔情——而那些危机，注定会在我们凝神看她的时候一一在我们眼前出现。简·奥斯汀是有深邃激情的女子，虽然表面上不大显露。她激发我们去填补没有直接写出的东西。表面上，她展示的内容无足轻重，但是构成它的东西却在读者头脑中逐渐伸展，使最经久不朽的形式与表面上无足轻重的生活场景相融合。重点在人物刻画。她让我们寻思：待到差五分三点，奥斯本勋爵和汤姆·马斯格雷夫前来拜访、玛丽搬出茶盘和餐刀匣，爱玛会如何表现呢？那会是极为尴尬的场面。两位青年男子平时习惯了更讲究的生活。爱玛可能会显得缺乏教养，庸常粗俗，不足挂齿。谈话迂回曲折，悬念始终令我们惴惴不安。我们的注意力半是聚焦于当时，半是着眼于未来。最后，爱玛的表现证实了我们对她最好的期待，我们不禁深受触动，仿佛曾目睹了最重大的事件。这部尚未完成、总的来说也较为逊色的作品，其实具备构成奥斯汀著作伟大品质的所有元素。它具有文学的永恒性。即使不计生动活泼的表层叙述和贴近生活的逼真绘写，仍有对人性价值的精微辨识可给人带来更深切的愉悦。倘若把这点也抛开，人们仍能怀着无限乐趣倾心关注描述舞会场面的相对抽象的艺术手法，其中展现的情感是那么繁复多样，述及的各个部分那么详略得当，真值得好好玩味，就像欣赏诗歌，只为它本身，而不把它当作将故事引向此处或彼处的一个环节。

不过，有闲话议论说简·奥斯汀身板僵直，一丝不苟，沉默寡言——“是人人害怕的拨火棍”。关于这一点，也确有些蛛丝马迹。她能落笔无情，是整个文学史中最前后一致、不改本色的讽刺家之一。《沃森一家》开头那些粗略拙朴的章节表明她并非多产的天才，不像艾米莉·勃朗特，只需打开门就能让自己被充分感知。她谦卑而快乐地一点点收集筑巢的小枝和草秸，把它们整整齐齐码好。那些枝丫和草秸有点枯干，有点土蓬蓬的。那一带乡间有大房子和小房子；有茶会、餐会和偶尔举办的户外聚餐；生活受到有身份的亲友关心及适量收入的护佑；也被泥泞的路、濡湿的脚以及一些女士们易于疲倦的倾向所局限；维持这般生活的是一点儿钱、一点儿身价，还有当地中上阶层通常会受到的一点教育。罪恶、冒险和激情被摈除在外。然而，尽管平庸，尽管琐碎，奥斯汀却从不回避、从不含糊。她耐心而精准地告诉我们，他们“一路不停，径直到达纽伯里，在那儿用了饭，又当午餐又当晚餐；就此结束了一天的享受和劳顿”。对于传统习俗，她并非只是说点空头好话虚与应付；她不仅接受它们，而且真心相信。当她描写埃德蒙·贝特伦之类的牧师，或某位水手，她似乎受制于他们神圣的职业，不再能畅快淋漓地运用她的主要工具，即喜剧才能，反而常常陷入循规蹈矩的颂扬或有板有眼的描述。不过这些是例外，多数情况下她的态度令人想起那位未留名的女士的惊呼：“不声不响，闷头摹写人物的才女，着实叫人害怕！”奥斯汀既不想改造什么，也不想消灭什么；她沉默不语，而这的确可怕。一个又一个，她塑造了她的傻瓜，她的道貌岸然者，她的市侩，她的柯林斯先生、沃尔特·埃利奥特爵士和班奈特太太们。她用鞭子般的词语团团抽打他们，那些词语在他们四周旋动，将他们的身影永远地镌刻定型。他们就那样存在着，没有给他们任何借口，也没有向他们表示任何慈悲。当她处理完毕，朱莉亚和玛丽安·贝特伦姐妹俩消失得片羽不存；可贝特伦夫人却永远地留下了，“坐着，招呼着小狗帕格，不让它溜进花坛”。神意的公道裁判普施于四方。格兰特博士起初爱大吃嫩烧鹅，最后“因为每一周例行不误大吃三顿，发作脑中风死去”。有时候，奥斯汀笔下的某些人物生出来只为让作者能兴高采烈地把他们的脑袋削掉。她心满意足；她气定神闲，便不再想动任何人头上一根发丝，也不再挪移那个让她感到如此美妙怡情的世界中的任何一块砖头或一根草叶。

而我们，千真万确，也不会那样做。即使受到刺激的虚荣心疼痛不已，即使道德的愤怒热火中烧，促使我们去改良这充斥恶毒、卑鄙和愚昧的世界，那任务也是我们力所不及的。人就是那样——一个15岁女孩通晓这点，而成年的女人则证明了这一点。此时此刻，某贝特伦夫人正在阻止小狗帕格钻进花坛；她遣了查普曼去帮助范妮小姐，不过有点为时太晚。明辨秋毫，精准无瑕，她的讥嘲讽刺是那么公正无偏，所以，虽然它始终存在，却几乎逃过了我们的注意。没有一丝卑琐小气，没有丁点儿刻薄恶意，会惊动我们的沉思。欣悦之感奇特地与我们的取乐心态交汇融合。艺术之美照耀着那些傻瓜。

那不易把握的品质实际上由一些大不相同的部件构成，需要某种特殊才能把它们组合到一起。奥斯汀的机智有完美的趣味伴随。奥斯汀笔下的傻瓜之所以是傻瓜，势利鬼之所以是势利小人，皆因偏离了她心目中的健全与理性的模式，而且，即使在逗人笑的时候她也把这一信息准确无误地传达给了我们。她比任何别的小说家都更多地动用了对人类价值的无比精准的感知。她以从不迷失的心灵、从无差错的趣味和几乎严峻的道德信念为鉴照，展示了那些背离仁善、真实和诚挚的言行，她的这类描写乃是英国文学中最令人愉悦的精粹。她刻画好坏参半的玛丽·克劳福德，靠的就是这个方式。她从容不迫、兴致盎然地让玛丽喋喋不休地贬损教士，或赞赏某位年收入一万英镑的男爵。时不时地，奥斯汀会插入自己的声音，毫不张扬，和谐妥帖，可是玛丽·克劳福德的唠叨顿时神采尽失，虽说仍能让读者感到几分有趣。如此，她笔下的众多场面是那么深邃、优美而复杂。这种对比中生成了一种美，甚至是一种庄严，它不仅和奥斯汀的机智一样抢眼，也是那种机智的不可分割的组成部分。在《瓦森一家》中她让读者预先品味了这种才华。她让我们讶异，一桩寻常的友善之举，如她所描绘，竟那般意味深长。而在她的成熟杰作中，这一才能被发挥到尽善尽美。她的著作并没有什么特殊的事件：某天中午在北安普顿郡，一名平淡无奇的青年男子在楼梯上对一位纤柔姑娘说话，他们上楼去换装准备出席正式晚餐，身旁有女仆正在经过。然而，陡然间他们的谈话从琐屑和庸常升华，变得充满意义，那一刻对两人来说都成了终生难忘的瞬间。如一颗水珠充盈自身，它光彩照人；它熠熠闪亮；有那么一刹那它悬在我们面前，深邃，颤动，澄明。转眼之后，女仆走过去了，温柔地融聚着所有人生幸福的这滴水坠下，复归于日常生活的潮涨潮落。

奥斯汀特别善于洞察琐事之中的深意，她选择描写日复一日常规生活中的诸般小事，写聚会、野餐、乡村舞蹈，岂不是十分自然？摄政王或克拉克先生(8)“建议改变写作的文体”不能诱使她转向；没有哪种罗曼史，哪种冒险故事、政治内幕或阴谋运作可以烛照她所亲见的乡宅楼梯上的生活。当真，摄政王和他的图书管理员撞上了最可怕的障碍，他们在试图干预不可败坏的良知，搅扰从不失误的慎明。那个15岁就写下了漂亮文句的孩子再也没有停笔，而且她写作压根不是为了摄政王和他的图书馆员，而是为了更广大的世人。她准确地知道本人优长何在，适合应对哪些题材——如一名对成品心存高标准要求的作家那样处理应对。有些感知印象在她的领域之外，有些激情她即使勉为其难强施巧计也无法恰当地装点推出。例如，她无法让一个姑娘热烈地谈论旌旗或小礼拜堂。她无法让自己全心全意地沉浸于某个浪漫时刻。她有各式各样的法子逃避激情场面。她以自己特有的旁敲侧击的方式写自然及其美景。她描述美丽的夜晚却从不曾提到月亮。尽管如此，当我们读到那整饬的寥寥数语“万里无云的夜空满是清辉，映衬着树林的幽深暗影”时，夜色就如她所说，是“那么庄严，宁谧而美好”，非常明白，就是如此。

奥斯汀的才华如此均衡，难得地完美。她所有完成了的小说中没有失败之作，她的众多章节里很少有哪一章明显低于水平线。不过，她毕竟年仅42岁就过世了，死在能力巅峰期。她尚待经历那些使晚年成为作家生涯中最有趣阶段的种种变故。活泼灵动，气韵难遏，富有生机勃勃的创造力，如果假以时日，她肯定还会写出更多的作品，而且简直让人乐于揣测她是否会改换写作的路数。边界已经划定；月亮、山峦和城堡都在界外。不过，她不是有时也曾试图短暂越界吗？她不是也正开始以自己特有的快活而精彩的方式，盘算一次小小的发现之旅吗？

让我们以奥斯汀最后一部完成的小说《劝导》为例，并借助于它来看一看假使作者多活几年可能会写出些怎样的书。《劝导》具有特殊的美，也有特别的沉闷。那种沉闷常常出现在两个创作阶段之间的过渡期。作家有点厌烦了。她有点太熟悉自己那个世界的行为方式了；录述它们不再使她感到新鲜。她的喜剧性描写中有一份严厉，表明她不再觉得沃尔特爵士的虚荣或埃利奥特小姐的势利有趣。讽刺是生硬的，笑话是粗鲁的。她不再对日常生活的乐子有新奇感受。她的心思不全在她的书写对象上。不过，虽说我们觉得简·奥斯汀已经写过这些了，而且曾写得更好，却也同时意识到她在尝试某种她从未染指的东西。《劝导》中有一种新元素，一种新特质，也许正是这点使休厄尔博士(9)热情迸发，宣称它是“奥斯汀最优美的作品”。她开始发现，世界其实比她过去想得更宽广、更神秘、更浪漫。她议论说，安妮“年轻时被迫小心谨慎行事，年齿渐长之际却学得了浪漫——这是不自然开端的自然后果”，我们觉得这话也适用于她本人。她常常驻笔于自然景色的优美和沉郁，舍弃了往时常常流连的春光却转而注意秋色。她谈到“在乡下，秋季时光的影响是那么甜美而又哀伤”。她留心着“褐色的枯叶和凋萎的灌木篱”。她还议论说，“即使曾在某地吃过苦头，人们也不会消减对那个地方的爱”。不过，我们觉察到变化，不仅是这种对自然景色的新敏感，还有，她对生活的态度也变了。在这本书里她大多数时候是通过女性之眼来看生活的，那女性人物自己不快乐，因此对他人的幸福和不幸怀有特殊的同情，尽管直到小说接近结尾，她都只能在心里无声地评说种种事态。由此，与通常情况相比，书中呈现的被观察到的情态与其说是事实，不如说更大程度上是感受。音乐会场景和有关女人忠贞爱情的那段著名谈话明确地表达了热烈激情，不但证明了奥斯汀曾经恋爱过这个传记事实，也证明了她不再惮于说出这点的美学事实。重要的人生体验，必先深深沉入心底，随岁月流逝得到彻底净化，而后她才允许自己在小说中启用它们。到1817年，奥斯汀已经万事俱备。就外部环境而言，某种变化也即将到来。她的声誉上升得非常缓慢。“我怀疑，”她侄儿利·奥斯汀写道，“是否能找出其他任何一位知名作家，本人像她这般过着彻底默默无闻的生活。”如果她再多活几年，一切都将改变。她将可以去伦敦小住，外出赴晚宴、用午餐，会见名流，结交新友，阅读，旅行，把一大堆观感带回宁静的乡间小舍，以便闲时从容享用。

这一切又将对简·奥斯汀未写的六部小说有怎样的影响呢？她不会去写犯罪、情欲或冒险故事。她不会因出版商的催促或朋友们的奉承匆匆赶活儿，草草敷衍或言不由衷。但她会更加见多识广。她的安全感将被动摇。她的滑稽喜剧将会受损。她将更少依赖对话而更多通过观照评说让我们了解她的人物（这在《劝导》中已露端倪）。短短几分钟闲谈中精彩的三言两语足以涵盖某克罗夫特海军上将或某马斯格雷夫太太所需要了解的一切，然而，在陈述分析和展示心理的章节中，信手拈来的速记式笔法将会显得过于粗糙，无法容纳她此时已充分辨识的复杂人性。她会发明一种新方法，一如既往地清晰而从容，但却更深入，更意味隽永，不仅记述人们说了些什么，而且表达出他们的言外之意；不仅写出人们的本相，而且写出人生的本质。她将与笔下的人物更远地拉开距离，更多地把他们看作是群体，而非单一个人。她的讽刺笔触也许将不那么持续不断，但会更加辛辣严苛。她会成为亨利·詹姆斯以及普鲁斯特(10)的前驱者——不过，就此打住吧。这些猜想无补于事：那位最完美的女性艺术家，不朽著作的写者，“正当她开始对自己的成功萌生出信心的时候”，却溘然长逝了。

玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特(1)


很古怪，大战事的影响总是断断续续的。法国大革命攫住了某些人，把他们的生活撕裂，却悄然放过了另一些人，没有扰动他们一根发丝。据说奥斯汀从未提过法国革命；查尔斯·兰姆(2)对之置若罔闻；花花公子布卢梅尔(3)丝毫不曾把它放在心上。但是对华兹华斯和葛德文(4)来说，这场革命乃是曙光，他们从中明白无误地看到：

法兰西屹立于金色时光之巅，

人类的本性仿佛正重逢新生。

一个善于渲染的历史学家轻而易举就能把这种顶顶触目的对比并列起来——一面是切斯特菲尔德街的布卢梅尔，他的下巴小心翼翼地安放在领结上，用绝无粗俗的重音而且细加斟酌的腔调讨论着外衣翻领应如何裁剪；另一边在索默斯城有一伙衣衫不整的兴奋的年轻人聚会，其中一位脑袋太大、鼻子过长的先生每天都在茶桌上侃侃而谈，议论人类的从善性、理想的团结统一，以及人权，等等。在场的人中还有一位妇女，眼睛非常明亮，谈吐极为热切，那些年轻的男人——他们拥有的是些中等阶级的姓氏，诸如巴罗(5)、霍尔克罗夫特(6)或葛德文之类——干脆称呼她“沃斯通克拉夫特”，就好像她是否已婚无关紧要，就好像她和他们一样是个男性青年。

知识者当中的这种触目的不一致——查尔斯·兰姆和葛德文，简·奥斯汀和玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特都是智识高拔的人——表明了环境在怎样的程度上影响着见解。如果葛德文生长在伦敦圣殿法学院区，或是在基督慈幼学堂深受古物和古书的濡染，他很可能对于浮泛地谈论人类未来以及人的权利根本不感兴趣。如果简·奥斯汀幼年时曾经横躺在楼梯口阻挡她父亲殴打母亲，她心中也一定会燃起对暴君的强烈仇恨，她的小说也一定会充满对正义的呼唤。

而这正是玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特对所谓婚姻幸福的最早的体验。后来玛丽的妹妹埃弗琳娜的婚事也很不美满，她在马车里把自己的结婚戒指咬成了碎片。她的弟弟是个累赘，她父亲经营农场赔了本。为了让那个脾气暴烈、头发肮脏、名声不佳的红脸汉子能重整旗鼓，玛丽忍辱负重，到贵族家当了家庭教师。总而言之，她从没尝过幸福的滋味，而正因如此，她编造了一套信条，对应于苦难深重的人类生活的真相。她的学说的主旨是：唯有独立最重要。“他人对我们的每个恩典都是新的枷锁，都削减我们固有的自由，败坏我们的思想。”女人首先必须独立，她必须具备的不是高雅风度或迷人魅力，而是精力、勇气和将意愿付诸实行的能力。玛丽觉得最可夸耀的，是能够说“凡我决心做的重要的事，我无不贯彻如一”。她这样说确实问心无愧。她30岁刚出头之时，就已经有资格回首自己顶着强大反对势力所采取的一系列行动了。她曾费尽心力，为朋友范妮租了一处住房，哪知范妮改变了主意，不再需要房子了。她曾办了一所学校。她曾劝说范妮和斯凯先生结婚。她曾抛开学校只身一人前往里斯本去照料垂危的范妮。在归途中，她迫使船长救援一艘遇难的法国船，她威胁说如果船长见死不救，她将告发他。她狂热地爱上了富塞利(7)，公开表示要和他一起生活，却遭到他妻子的断然拒绝；于是她立刻将她的果断行动原则付诸实行，动身前往巴黎，决心以写作为生。

因此对她来说革命不只是身外发生的一件事，而是流淌在她自己的血脉中。她一生都在反叛——反对暴君，反对法律，反对习俗。她心中涌动着改革者对人类的热忱，其中包含的恨和爱一样多。法国革命的爆发表达了某些她最深切服膺的理论和信念。在那个火热的特殊时代里，她一挥而就，写出了两部大胆而雄辩的著作——《答伯克》和《为女权一辩》，它们都是些至理名言，以致今天看来似乎已毫不新鲜——当年的独创新颖之论已经成了我们的老生常谈。不过，当她只身在巴黎独住于一所大宅中时，她亲眼看到自己一向蔑视的国王在国民卫队押送下乘车经过，而且，出乎她的意料，他保持着颇多的尊严，于是，“说不清由于什么缘故”，泪水涌进了她的眼眶，“我正要上床睡觉，”她在那封信结尾时说道，“平生第一遭，我不愿熄灭蜡烛。”事情毕竟不那么简单。她甚至不能明白自己的情感。她目睹着自己最珍视的信念付诸实施——她却泪水盈眶。她赢得了名声、独立和按自己意愿生活的权利——可她却渴盼着别的什么。“我不想被人当作女神敬爱，”她说，“我想成为你生活中的必不可少的人。”因为，她的收信人伊姆利(8)，那个迷人的美国人，曾经对她很好。她确实热烈地爱着他。然而她的信念之一是：爱必须是自由的，“相互的，爱恋就是婚姻，一旦爱情死亡——如果爱情死亡的话——婚姻关系就不该维系下去”。然而，就在她渴求自由的同时，她也祈望着安定。“我喜欢‘喜爱’这个词，”她写道，“因为它意味着某种习以为常的事物。”

所有这些内在的矛盾和冲突都在她脸上表现了出来，她的面容既坚定又恍惚，既性感又聪慧，此外也很美丽，有明亮的大眼睛和浓密的长鬈发，所以骚塞(9)认为这是他所见过的最富于表情的面孔。这样一个女人的生活注定要充满疾风暴雨。她每天编造出指导生活的理论，她每天都在他人的成见上碰壁。而且，因为她并不是书呆子，也并非冷血的理论家，每一天她的身心都生出一些新东西，把她的理论推到一旁，迫使她重新构建那些理论。她根据理论行事，认为自己对伊姆利没有法律权利，拒绝和他结婚，但是当他扔下她和他们的孩子离去，一星期又一星期仍不归来，她却又痛苦得不堪忍受。

她本人是这般意乱心迷，甚至连她自己都难以理解，也就无法苛责那个背信弃义的凡胎俗子伊姆利没能跟上她的快速变化，以及她忽而理智忽而不理智的情绪周期。即使一些不偏不倚的朋友也常为她的自相矛盾而不安。玛丽激情洋溢地热爱自然。有一夜晚，天空的色彩无比精妙，玛德琳·史威泽忍不住对她说：“玛丽，来吧——来呀，爱自然的人——享受一下这奇妙的景象——这不断变幻的色彩。”可是玛丽却一直目不转睛地盯着德·瓦尔佐根男爵。“我得承认，”史威泽夫人写道，“这种性爱的专注给我造成了非常不好的印象，我的满心愉悦顿时烟消云散。”如果说那位多情善感的瑞士女人是因玛丽的情欲而不安，精明的生意人伊姆利则是受不了她的心智。每当他见到玛丽，便被她的魅力征服，但随之感到她的敏锐、洞察和她毫不妥协的理想主义在不断骚扰着他。她看得透他的借口，她能回敬他所有的理由，她甚至能料理他的生意。和她在一起简直没有安宁——他只能再一次离开。这时她的信就会追踪他，以其真挚和洞见折磨他。那些信都十分坦率，都热切地请求他讲真话；还无比蔑视肥皂、明矾、财富和安逸；她曾再三地说，只要他表了态，“你就再不会听到我的消息，”他担心事情真会闹到这地步，他觉得受不了。他本想逗逗小鱼，结果钓上只海豚，那家伙把他一下拖进水里，搞得他头晕目眩，只想逃脱。虽然他也玩票涉猎理论，但归根到底是个生意人，他依赖肥皂和明矾谋生。“生活中次一等的乐趣，”他承认说，“在我来说是必要的享受。”而其中有一种是玛丽嫉妒的追究眼光所一直不能猜透的。是什么使他不断地离开她？是生意？是政治？是别的女人？他徘徊不决，他们见面时他很可爱，但不久他又消失了。最后，玛丽气急败坏，疑心重重，简直有点神智失常，从厨子口中逼出了真相。她被告知说，某巡回剧团的一个小姑娘是伊姆利的情人。玛丽丝毫不爽地贯彻了采取决断行动的原则，把衣裙浸了个透湿以确保自己一定下沉，然后从帕特尼桥纵身投河。她被人救了起来。在经历了一番无法描述的痛苦以后，她那“不可征服的伟大的心灵”又康复了，她那小姑娘气的自立理论又占了上风。她决定再一次尝试争取幸福，并且自己养活自己和女儿，不要伊姆利的一文钱。

正在这个当口上，她再次见到了葛德文，那个长着硕大头颅的小个子男人。当初他们相识时，法国革命使索默斯城的青年认为新世界正在诞生。说她遇到了葛德文，是个委婉的说法，事实上是玛丽·沃斯通克拉夫特登门拜访了他。这是法国革命的影响吗？是否她所目睹的街头流血，以及她耳际回响的狂怒人群的呐喊，使她觉得采取哪种方式——是披上斗篷到索默斯城拜会葛德文，还是在西祝德街坐等他来访——并无关紧要？而激发了那个奇特男人的，又是怎样不寻常的生活的动荡呢？他是卑鄙和伟大、冷酷和深情的奇异混合体——因为，如果没有独特深切的内心感受，就写不出关于他妻子的回忆录。他认为玛丽做得对，他因为她把种种束缚女性生活的荒谬陈规踩在脚下而尊敬她。他在许多问题，尤其在两性关系问题上持有极为特别的见解。他认为男女之间的情爱也应受理性引导。他认为他们的关系包含某种精神的因素。他曾说过：“婚姻是一种立法，是最坏的法律……婚姻是一种财产关系，是最坏的财产。”他相信，如果男女双方相悦，他们不必有任何仪式就可同居，或者，比方说，住在同一条街上相距20来个门——因为同住在一起常常会磨蚀爱情。不仅如此，他还说，如果别的男人喜欢你妻子，“这不成其为问题。我们可以同时共享她的言谈。而且我们都将很聪明地把肉体关系看作是区区小事”。不错，当他写这些时，他还根本不曾恋爱过；此时他才头一遭体验了爱的滋味。这感情来得很平静，很自然，由于在索默斯城的一次次谈话，由于他们俩不合礼仪地独自在他的住房里议论天下万事，感情在“双方的心灵中同样发展着”。“友谊渐渐融为爱情……”他写道，“当按照事情发展的进程，倾吐衷肠的时刻来临时，双方都发现其实已没什么可向对方吐诉的了。”无疑，他们在那些最根本的问题上是观点一致的。比如说，他们都认为婚姻是不必要的。他们将继续分开居住。不过，自然再一次干预了。玛丽发现自己怀了孕，这时她想：为一个理论而失去自己看重的朋友们，值得吗？她觉得不值，于是他们结婚了。而另外一种理论——夫妻最好分开居住的理论——难道不也与她的一些新生的情感相矛盾吗？“丈夫是房中一件便利的家具。”她写道。实际上，她发现自己原来十分热衷家庭生活。那么，为什么不也修正另外那条理论，搬到一起住呢。葛德文可以在附近另找一间屋子当工作室；如果他们想的话，可以分别出去吃饭——他们应该各有各的工作，各有各的朋友。他们就这么说定了，这个计划运转得十分成功。这种安排兼有“访问会见的新奇感和生动感，以及家庭生活的更美妙的、由衷的乐趣”。玛丽承认她很快乐；葛德文坦白说：“一个人在玄学中长久浸润之后，发现有人关心他本人的幸福，实在是个莫大的满足。”由于这新的满足，玛丽身心中的各种力量和情感都被解放了出来。琐事给了她妙不可言的快乐——看葛德文和伊姆利的孩子一起玩；或想到他们的孩子即将出生；或某一天到乡下远足，等等。有一天，她在新道街碰见了伊姆利，并毫无怨恨地跟他打了招呼。葛德文写道：“我们的幸福是疏懒的幸福，是充满自私而短暂的欢乐的天堂。”不，这也是一种试验，就像玛丽的人生从一开始就是实验，这是使人类习俗更符合人类需要的尝试。而且他们的婚姻才仅仅是个开端，各式各样的事会相继而来。玛丽将要生孩子。她将写一本名为《妇女的苦难》的书。她将改革教育。她生孩子那天将下楼来吃晚饭。她在分娩期间将雇一名产婆而不用医生——不过这成了她的最后一个试验。她死于分娩。她对自己的生存有强烈的感受，即使在最不幸的时候她也高声大气地说：“一想到死——想到失去我自己——我就受不了。不，我觉得，自己不复存在简直是不可能的。”然而这样一个人却在36岁时死去了。但她也回击了命运。她下葬后的130余年间有千百万人死去并被遗忘了。然而，当我们今天阅读她的书信，倾听她的论辩，思考她的种种试验——其中最有成果的即是她和葛德文的关系——并认识到她曾怎样慷慨大度、热血激扬地体认生活的精髓时，她无疑获得了某种形式的永生。她活着，积极能动地活着，她在论争，在尝试。今天我们仍然能在活着的人们中听到她的声音，辨别出她的影响。

多萝西·华兹华斯


两个迥然不同的人，玛丽·沃尔斯通克拉夫特和多萝西·华兹华斯(1)，曾经一前一后出外旅行。1795年，玛丽带着她的婴儿在易北河上的阿尔托纳(2)住过一时；三年以后，多萝西跟着哥哥和柯勒律治(3)也到这里来了。她们两个人都写了旅行记——两个人游历的地方完全一样，但她们看待这些地方的眼光却大不相同。玛丽所看到的一切，促使她思考某种理论，思考政府的效能、人民的状况，以及她自己心灵的奥秘。船桨拍打着水波的声音使她发出了这样的疑问：“生命，你究竟是什么？这一口气究竟要漂流到何方？我还是像这样活着的我吗？在它发出并吸收了新的能量之后，它究竟要溶化到什么样的元素中去呢？”有时候，她只顾盯着沃尔佐根男爵，而忘了观看夕阳残照。而多萝西却将她眼前所见之物，用准确细密的文字实实在在、原原本本地记录下来。“从阿尔托纳散步到汉堡是非常愉快的。在一大片栽种着树木的土地上，有一条条沙砾小路穿过。……易北河对岸的地面上看来却是沼泽纵横。”多萝西从来不去骂那“专制主义的魔鬼”。多萝西从来不提那些关于出口、入口一类的“男人们的问题”；她也不会把自己的灵魂和天空搅混在一起。“这样活着的我”，对她来说，是无条件地从属于那些花草树木的。因为，如果她让“我”和它的是是非非、哀乐苦痛介入到她和客观事物之间，那么，她就得把月亮叫作“黑夜的女王”，她就得大谈什么黎明时“灿烂夺目的光芒”，她就要翱翔于梦幻和狂想的缥缈之境，而无心去为那湖面上月光粼粼的景色找出确切的词句加以描绘。还有，“水底的鲱鱼”——如果她尽顾想自己的心事，当然也就无暇去写了。因此，当玛丽一次又一次碰壁，高叫着“在这颗心里一定存在着某种永生不灭的东西——人生绝不是幻梦一场”，多萝西却在阿尔富克斯顿(4)慢条斯理地记录着春天到来的脚步：“野李树开花了，山楂丛发青了，公园里的落叶松也由黑变绿——这都是在两三天之内发生的事。”第二天，即1798年4月14日，她写道：“黄昏，风狂雨暴，我们足不出户。收到《玛丽·沃尔斯通克拉夫特传》等书。”次日，他们在乡绅的空地里散步，看到“不少为人力损毁得不成样子的东西正由大自然着意装点，得以美化——荒废的房址，隐者的旧居，等等，等等。”对于玛丽·沃尔斯通克拉夫特则一字未提——似乎她那充满暴风雨的一生，用一个简单的“等等”就打发掉了；然而，下边的一句话好像是某种不自觉之中流露出来的评论：“幸好，我们无权根据个人意志去塑造大山、开辟峡谷。”是的，我们无权去改动什么，更不去抗拒；我们只能接受并尽量理解大自然的信息。——日记就这么样地写下去。

春去，夏来，夏又到秋；冉冉便是冬天，于是野李树又开了花，山楂树又发了青，再一次春回大地了。现在是北英格兰的春天，多萝西和她哥哥住在格拉斯米尔(5)高山丛中一个小树林里。经历了艰苦备尝、骨肉分离的少年时代，他们终于在自己的家屋中相聚；现在，他们生活在大自然的怀抱里，可以不受干扰地从事自己一心向往的事业，天天努力领会大自然的启示。他们手头宽裕，足够维持生活，无须为衣食奔走。既无家务之累，也无职业任务分他们的心。多萝西可以整个白天在山上跑着玩儿，晚上坐在屋里和柯勒律治谈上个通宵，没有舅妈骂她疯疯癫癫、不像个女孩儿家的样子。日出到日落，时间都属于他们自己，作息方式可以根据季节变化来加以调整。天气好，不必待在屋里；下雨天，躺在床上不起。什么时候睡觉都行。如果有一只杜鹃在山头兀自啼叫，而威廉一直想不出什么确切的词句来描写它，那就让做好的饭放凉也没关系。星期天跟其他日子没什么区别。习惯，传统，一切，都得从属于那必须全神贯注、付出极大努力、令人疲惫不堪的唯一任务——在大自然的怀抱里生活、写诗。那真是把人磨得筋疲力尽。为了寻找一个准确的字眼儿，威廉用尽心血，累得头疼。每首诗，他总是推敲了再推敲，所以多萝西不敢提什么改动意见。她偶尔说了一句半句话，被他听见，记在脑子里，他的心情就再也无法平静下来。有时候，他下楼来吃早饭，却坐在餐桌旁，“衬衣的领口不扣，背心也敞开”，写着一首从她谈话中得到构思的咏蝴蝶诗，写着写着把吃东西都忘了，而且对那首诗改了又改，直到又是筋疲力尽为止。

这部完全由只言片语所构成的日记，竟能使这一切如此活灵活现地重现在我们眼前。想来真有点奇怪，因为任何一个性格文静的妇女都能像这样把她花园里的变化、她哥哥的种种心情和季节的转换记载下来。一整天的雨后，（她记述道）天气温暖而和煦。她在田野里碰见一头母牛。“那头母牛望着我，我也望着那头母牛；我只要稍微动弹一下，那头母牛就停止吃草。”她还遇见过一个拄两根棍子走路的老人——连着多少天，除了吃草的母牛、走路的老人，她再也看不到什么不寻常的事情。而她记这些日记的目的也很平常——“因为，一来，我不想一个人在那里自寻烦恼；二来，等威廉回家，可以让他看了高兴一下。”只是，渐渐地这部简括的札记与其他札记的不同之处就显露出来了；随着这些短短的日记在我们心目中一点一点地展开，我们眼前便呈现出一片广阔的景象，这才看出那质朴无华的记述紧扣所描写的事物，只要我们的眼光照着它所指出的方向看去，定可如实地看到她自己所见到的事物。“月光像雪一样落在山上。”“空气一片寂静，湖水现出亮亮的蓝灰色，群山一派苍茫。湾流冲向那低低的、幽暗的湖滨。羊群在休息。一切都是静悄悄的。”“那上游和下游的瀑布，好像并不是一个一个的瀑布，而像是从天而降的涛声——天上的声音。”即使在这样短短的日记中，我们也可以感觉到那种并非属于博物学者，而是属于诗人天赋的暗示能力。也就是说，抓住非常普通的事实，略加点染，那整个景象——宁静的湖水、壮丽的群山，就以浓郁的色调、天然的姿态出现在我们眼前。然而，她却又不是一般意义上的描写文作者。她首先关心的是力求真实——优美和对称都得附丽于真实才行。而真实之所以需要加以探索，又是因为如果在描写中把微风拂动湖水的景象稍加歪曲，也就有损那支配着表面风貌的精神。正是这种精神刺激着她，推动着她，使得她的才能得到充分发挥。每一种景象，每一种声音，只要她有感于心，她总要把这一感觉的来龙去脉进行一番探索，并且用文字把它记录下来，不管这文字多么质朴无华；或者把它凝练为某种形象，不管这形象多么生硬拙笨。大自然是一个严峻的女监工，她要求：无论那浩浩茫茫、幻影一般的外形轮廓，还是那毫发毕现的平凡细节，都得描摹出来。甚至当梦境般壮丽的远山在她面前巍巍颤动，她仍然要一丝不苟、原原本本地记下“羊群脊背上那闪闪烁烁的银白色的轮廓线”，并且写道，“向远处望去，在阳光下飞翔的乌鸦变成了银白色；当它们向更远处飞时，就像水波荡漾似的在绿色的田野上滚动。”由于经常练习、运用，她的观察力磨炼得非常纯熟、敏锐；在外边步行一天，就能给她那心灵的眼睛贮存下好大一批奇闻逸事，足够她在暇日从容加以拣选。譬如说，在丹巴顿城堡外，羊群和士兵混搅在一起，又是多么奇怪的现象啊！不知什么原因，那些羊群看上去和实物一样大小，而那些士兵却像是些木偶；那些羊群的动作姿态自自然然、无所畏惧，而那些侏儒似的士兵的行动却是躁乱不安，看起来毫无意义。——这真是奇怪极了。有时候，她躺在床上，仰望天花板，觉得那些上了油漆的屋梁“发出光泽，好像是在阳光下一条条冰封着的乌黑岩石”。是的，它们“相互交叉，使我想起自己见过的一株浓荫覆顶、风雨剥蚀的大山毛榉树——它那枝柯交错、纷歧披离之状仿佛与这些屋梁近似。……天花板好似我假想中的一个地下洞窟或宫殿，窟顶潮湿滴水，月光曲曲折折泻入，色调犹如颜色浑然一体的宝石。我躺着仰望，直到炉火熄灭。……一夜很少成眠。”

确实，她似乎总是把眼睛睁得大大的，不停地观察着，不光是为了那不知疲倦的好奇心，也是由于崇敬的心情，觉得有某种至关重要的秘密隐藏在事物的表面下。有时候，她尽量控制自己的热烈感情，但她的笔还不免吞吞吐吐。正像德·昆西(6)说的，她说话时因为热情与羞怯相冲突而有点儿口吃。但她还是控制住了自己。她的脾气本来是容易感情冲动的，为那几乎支配了她的情感所折磨；她的眼睛常常带着“狂热而吃惊的神情”，但她必须控制自己，压抑自己；不然的话，她就无法完成自己的任务——她就只好停止自己的观察活动。然而，对于一个能克制自己、能捐弃自己的隐秘激情的人，好像作为报偿一样，大自然就要给予一种异乎寻常的满足。她写道：“雷德尔(7)的景色非常美丽，天空上泛出好像一片片叶子似的发亮的钢灰色条纹。……这使得我的心归于宁静。我本来是非常忧郁的。”因为，柯勒律治不是曾经翻山越岭，深夜来到他们居住的农舍敲门——而她不是也曾经把柯勒律治的一封信深深藏在怀里带回来吗？

这样，一方面向大自然做出奉献，一方面又从大自然得到报偿，随着这辛勤、刻苦的岁月流逝，在大自然和多萝西之间似乎发展出某种水乳交融般的共鸣——这共鸣并不是冷冰冰、木呆呆、无人情味的，因为在它的核心之中还燃烧着对“我亲爱的人”，亦即对她的哥哥的热爱，而他实际上乃是这一共鸣的中心和鼓舞者。威廉，大自然，多萝西，岂不就是同一存在吗？无论在室内、户外，他们岂不总是构成一个万物皆备、无求于人、独立不羁的三位一体吗？他们在室内静坐，这时——

大约10点钟，在一个静悄悄的夜晚。炉火摇曳，钟声嘀嗒。除了我亲爱的人的呼吸之外，我什么声音也听不见——他不时推推书本，翻过一张书页。

4月里的一天，他们带上破斗篷，到屋子外边的约翰丛林里躺下。

威廉时而听见我的呼吸声和衣服的沙沙声，但是我们两个人都静静地躺着，谁也看不见谁。他认为如果像这样躺在坟墓里，谛听大地宁静的声音，而且知道自己亲爱的朋友就在身边，倒是很美妙的事。湖水平静，有一只小船在湖面上。

这是一种奇异、奥妙而且几乎是无声的爱，好像这一对兄妹生长在一起，不仅语言，连心情也是完全相同的，因此他们简直不知道两人之中究竟是谁在感受，谁在说话，谁在欣赏水仙花，谁在观看入睡的城市——不同之处仅仅在于：多萝西先把这种思绪写成散文，储存下来，然后威廉也来沉浸于其中，并把它写成诗歌。但两个人缺一不可。他们必须共同感受，共同思想，共同生存。这时正是如此：他们先在户外山坡上躺了一阵儿，起来回家弄茶；然后，多萝西给柯勒律治写信；接着，他们一块儿播种红花菜豆；然后，威廉写他的《采集水蛭的人》，多萝西为他抄写诗稿。既是心荡神怡，又能有所控制；既是无拘无束，又能井然有序——这部日记娓娓叙来，既描写令人迷醉的山上风光，也述说着烤面包、熨衬衣，以及在农舍里给威廉端晚饭这些家常琐事。

这所农舍，虽然从后园延伸到荒野之中，门前却临着大路。从她的起居室窗口向外望去，多萝西可以看到路上走过的每一个人：一个高高大大的女乞丐，她脊梁上也许还背着她的婴儿；一个老兵；一辆华贵的四轮马车，坐在里边游山玩水的贵妇人们好奇地向外窥看。那些有钱的贵人们，她都放过不管——她对他们的兴趣，也不过就像对大教堂、画馆和大城市一样。但是，如果她在门口遇见一个乞丐，她就一定要把他叫进屋里来，详详细细地打听一番：他从什么地方来？见过些什么？他有几个孩子？她对这些穷人们的生活寻根问底，好像其中也如群山似的隐藏着什么秘密。一个流浪汉在她的厨房里一边烤火，一边吃着冷藏肉，这对于她来说就如那星光灿烂的夜空一样神奇；她仔仔细细打量着他，甚至于看清楚在他那破烂的外表上“衬补着三块深蓝色、喇叭花形的补丁——那里原来该是三个扣子”，他那半个月没有刮的胡子就像是“灰色的长毛绒”。当这些人信口谈着什么航海呀、拉兵呀、葛兰贝侯爵(8)呀等故事的时候，她总会捕捉住他们话里的一言半语——在那些故事早被忘记的时候，它们还能久久地保留在她的心灵之中：“怎么，你要往西方走吗？”“当然，童男子到了天堂就大有出息啦！”“在那些夭折的青年人坟墓旁边，她才能轻轻松松地走路呀。”穷人们，就像群山一样，也有自己的诗意。但是，只有走出农舍，到户外，到路上，到旷野里，他们的想象力才得到最自由的发挥。当他们傍着一匹慢慢腾腾的马，在潮湿的苏格兰道路上徒步前进，既不知道能不能找到住的地方，也不知道能不能吃上晚饭的时候，她觉得那才是她最幸福的时刻。那时候，她只知道在前方有某个名胜，有一片丛林值得一记，有一个瀑布应该探访。他们一个小时接一个小时地向前走着，大部分时间里谁也不说话，只有柯勒律治（他参加了这次出游）不定什么时候突然大声讨论着“威严的”“崇高的”和“雄伟的”这三个字眼儿的真正含义。他们不得不一步一步艰难地行走，因为那匹马在一个堤岸上把车弄翻了，断了的缰绳、肚带刚刚用小绳子、小手绢接了起来。此外，他们还饿着肚子，因为华兹华斯把鸡肉和面包都掉到湖里去了，又没有什么其他东西可以当饭吃。他们路也不熟，不知道该到哪里去找住的地方——只知道前边儿有一个瀑布。最后，柯勒律治受不了啦。他有风湿性关节炎；那辆爱尔兰式的双轮马车根本不能遮风避雨；他那两个旅伴尽在那里想自己的心事，不说话。他离开他们，自己走了。但是威廉和多萝西只管往前走。这时候，他们两个人的模样就跟流浪汉差不多了。多萝西面颊棕红，像个吉卜赛人；她衣服破碎，步子急促，走路的样子歪歪扭扭。但她不知疲倦，目光炯炯，注意观察一切。他们终于来到瀑布之下。于是，多萝西的全部身心都集中到瀑布上面了。她以发现者的热情、博物学家的细心、情人的狂喜探索它的特征，记下它的外貌，阐明它的与众不同之处。她终于占有了它——把它永远储存在自己的心灵之中了。从此，它便形成一个“内心的幻影”，她随时都可以清清楚楚、仔仔细细地回想起来。即使多年以后，她老了，记忆力不好了，它还会袭上心头；它袭上她的心头，静定了，纯化了，并且与她生平中所有最幸福的回忆——与她关于瑞思多恩(9)、关于阿尔富克斯登、关于柯勒律治朗诵《克丽思塔贝尔》(10)、关于她那亲爱的哥哥威廉的回忆，交错在一起了。它给她带来的，是无人可以给予、也是一般人与人的关系所无法提供的东西——抚慰与安宁。因此，如果玛丽·沃尔斯通克拉夫特那激昂的呼声曾经传到她的耳边：“在这颗心里一定存在着某种永生不灭的东西——人生不是幻梦一场。”那么，她自己的答案也是明确无疑的。她大概会简简单单地答道：“我们只要观察周围的一切，就会觉得自己是幸福的。”

杰拉尔丁和简


杰拉尔丁·朱斯伯里(1)肯定没料到这个年月里还会有人理会她的小说。如果有谁从图书馆的书架上把它们取下来的时候叫她撞上了，她准要表示反对。“尽是些胡说八道，亲爱的。”她会说。之后呢，我们猜想她会以自己特有的不管不顾、不合传统的方式冲着图书馆、文学、爱情、生活和其他一切破口骂一句“去他娘的！”或“该死！”因为杰拉尔丁好骂人。

的确，杰拉尔丁·朱斯伯里的特别之处在于她把咒骂和钟爱、理智和激奋、勇敢和冲动融为一体，“……一方面温柔而无助，另一方面却力能劈石”——她的传记作家爱尔兰太太(2)这样描述她；还有，“从智能上看她是个男人，但身子里的那颗心却和任何一个夏娃的女儿一样女性化”。即使只看外表，她似乎也显得有些不协调，古怪并刺激人。她生得矮小却有男相，非常丑却又吸引人。她衣着讲究，把红头发套在发网里，戴一对鹦鹉形的小耳环，说话时耳环摇摇晃晃。在仅有的一幅她的肖像照片中，可看见她侧着脸坐在那里读书，显得更像是温柔而无助，而非力能劈石。

但是我们无法知道她坐到摄影师的桌旁读书之前发生了什么。她生于1812年，父亲是商人，家住在曼彻斯特或那一带。除此以外，对于她29岁以前的事我们几乎是一无所知。在19世纪前半期，女人到了29岁就算不得年轻了；她要么是已经活过了，要么是已经耽误了人生。虽然杰拉尔丁的行为不合乎传统方式，可以算是个例外，但毫无疑问仍可断定在我们认识她之前的那段朦胧岁月里发生过什么重大的变故。在曼彻斯特一定出过什么事。背景中浮现出某个模糊的男人身影——一个背信弃义但却令人着迷的家伙，他使她懂得了生活是险恶的，生活是艰难的，生活对女人来说简直是魔鬼。她的思想深处形成了一个黑暗的经验之潭，她不时地从中汲取安慰或供他人受用的指示。时不时地，她会高声地说：“哦，太可怕了，简直无法言传。整整两年我生活在这黑暗的黑暗中，只偶尔能短暂地摆脱。”有些季节里，“像在宁静而乏味的11月，那些日子里只有一片云，可那一片云却遮盖了整个天空”。她挣扎过，“但挣扎毫无用处”。她曾把卡德沃斯(3)从头到尾读了个遍。她在放弃挣扎之前曾写了篇文章论物质主义。因为，虽然她常常被各种激情所俘虏，但她又很奇特地与事物保持距离并喜欢思考。她乐于为“物质、精神和生命本质”之类的问题绞尽脑汁，即使她的心正在流血。她家楼上有只盒子，里面塞满了摘抄、提要和结论。不过，一个女人家又能得出什么结论呢？当爱遗弃了女人，当她的恋人对她不忠，有什么能帮助她呢？不，挣扎没有用；还是让浪涛吞没自己吧，让乌云笼罩头顶吧。她这么思忖着，常常躺在沙发上，手里拿件活儿，眼上遮个绿色的眼镜。她有好多毛病——眼睛痛、不断着凉、莫名其妙地疲乏；而曼彻斯特郊外的格林黑斯小镇——她在那里为哥哥当家——相当的潮湿。“隔着一层弥漫的阴冷的湿气，可见半融化的脏雪和雾，以及沼地般的草坪”——这就是她窗前的景色。她常常几乎没有力气穿过屋子。可还是不断有人打搅：突然来了人要吃饭；她就得跳起来跑到厨房亲手烧个鸡呀鸭呀什么的。备好了饭，她就会又戴上绿眼镜瞧她的书去了，因为她是个了不得的读书人。她读形而上学，读游记，读老书也读新书——特别是读卡莱尔先生(4)的美妙作品。

1841年初，她去了伦敦，央人介绍，拜会了那位她对其作品心仪已久的大人物。她因而也见到了卡莱尔太太。她们肯定是一见如故。因为没过几个星期卡莱尔太太就成了“亲爱的简”。她们准保无话不谈。她们准保畅谈了人生，谈了过去和现在，以及某些或是很动感情或是不动感情地关心杰拉尔丁的“个人”。卡莱尔太太是那么见多识广、出类拔萃、深通世故，并且看不起招摇撞骗的人，她一定把这个来自曼彻斯特的青年女子迷住了。杰拉尔丁一回曼彻斯特就开始给简写长信，继续她俩在禅恩巷(5)的知心谈话。“有个在女人中最受青睐的男人，他恰如你所祈望的那种最热烈而又极文雅的恋人，有一次他对我说……”她会这样开始。或许，她会这样想：

我们女人被造就成这个样子，也许是为了让他们以某种方式使世界丰饶。我们应继续去爱，而他们（男人）则继续争斗和劳作，而一段时间过后，我们都将同样被仁慈地准许死去。我不知你是否赞成这个观点，我看不清楚，没法争辩，因为我眼睛痛得厉害，视力很差。

可能简并不赞成这套高论。因为简比杰拉尔丁年长11岁。简不喜欢对生命本质进行抽象思维。简是最尖刻、最务实、最眼光明晰的女人。但也许值得一提的是，当她最初遇到杰拉尔丁的时候，她正初次感受嫉妒的前兆症状，随着她丈夫声名逐渐确立，她不安地意识到旧的关系在变异，新的关系在形成。无疑，在禅恩巷长谈的过程中，杰拉尔丁得到了某种推心置腹的信任，倾听了某些抱怨并得出了一些结论。因为她除了敏感多情，还是个独立思考的聪明诙谐女人，她讨厌她所谓的“道貌岸然”，就像卡莱尔太太憎恶“招摇撞骗”。此外，杰拉尔丁从一开始就对卡莱尔太太生出了某种最最奇怪的感情，她有“一种模糊的不确定的渴望，希望以某种方式成为你的至亲至爱”。“你会让我成为你的亲人并这样对待我，是吧？”她一次次恳求。

“我想你如天主教徒想他们的圣人，”她说，“……你会发笑，可我对你的感情不像女性朋友，更像是出自恋人！”卡莱尔太太无疑真的笑了，但她也不能不被这个小女人的倾慕打动。

这样，当卡莱尔先生本人在1843年初突然提议说，他们该邀请杰拉尔丁来小住一段，卡莱尔太太以她惯有的率直方式权衡了利弊以后，同意这个建议。她想，一点“杰拉尔丁”会“大大地活跃气氛”，但另一方面，太多的“杰拉尔丁”又会过于累人。杰拉尔丁把热泪滴到你手上；她盯着你；她围着你团团转；她总是激动不已。而且，虽然杰拉尔丁有“种种良好的和了不起的品质”，她却“天生有阴谋策划之癖”，这可能会在夫妻间惹出麻烦——虽然不是通常的那种，因为，卡莱尔太太忖度，她的丈夫“习惯”于喜欢她本人胜过其他女子，“而对他来说习惯比激情的力量更大”。从另一方面考虑呢，她本人近来在思想上有些懒惰；而杰拉尔丁喜欢谈话，喜欢机智的谈话；那个被放逐在曼彻斯特的女人满心渴念和热忱，请她来切尔西(6)未尝不是件善事。于是杰拉尔丁就来了。

她是2月1日或2日到的，一直住到3月11日那个星期六。1843年的那些拜访就是如此。房子很小，仆人们很不得力。而杰拉尔丁老是待在那儿。整个早上她都涂涂抹抹地写信。整个下午她在客厅的沙发上大睡特睡。星期天她穿上胸前开口很低的裙衣接待客人。她说得太多。至于她被人称道的才智嘛，“她像砍肉斧一样锐利，也一样狭窄”。她阿谀奉承。她甜言蜜语。她不够诚恳。她卖弄风情。她诅咒骂人。简直没办法让她离去。对她的不耐烦的控诉不断升级。卡莱尔太太几乎不得不把她撵出家门。最后她们终于告别了；杰拉尔丁登上马车的时候泪如雨下，但卡莱尔太太眼睛是干的。看到客人终于走了，她确实是大大地松了一口气。不过，当杰拉尔丁乘车走远了，她一人独处时，却并不那么心安理得。她知道自己对待邀请来的客人的举止并非无可挑剔。她表现得“冷淡、不和善，冷嘲热讽，不肯通融”。最让她恼火的是自己曾经把杰拉尔丁当作“知心人”。“上天保佑这样做后果仅仅是让人腻歪，而不是带来灾祸。”她写道。很明显，她非常不高兴，既生自己的气，也生杰拉尔丁的气。

杰拉尔丁回曼彻斯特去了，心下明白出了什么岔子。她们俩之间出现了疏远和沉默。人们重复着一些恶意中伤的故事，对此她将信将疑。但是杰拉尔丁是最没有报复心的女人——如卡莱尔太太本人所承认的，“她在争执中表现得非常高贵”——而且，如果说她憨痴而多情，但至少是既不自负，也不高傲。而且，最重要的是，她真心地爱简。没过多久她就又开始频频给卡莱尔太太写信了，简多少有点恼怒地评论说，她的“热忱和无私简直超乎常人”。她担心简的健康，表示说她并不想得到诙谐俏皮的回信，只要能说明简的真实状况，枯燥的信也就可以了。因为——说不定这就是别人受不了她这个客人的缘故之一——她在禅恩巷待了4个星期，已经得出了一些结论，而且她不大可能会对此完全缄口不言。“你身边没有人疼你，”她写道，“你那么耐心而又坚韧不拔，简直让我都讨厌这些德行了。可它们给你带来了什么？几乎把你害了个半死。”“卡莱尔，”她忍不住说，“他太伟大了，所以不适合过家常日子。把狮身人面巨像放在客厅里绝不会相宜。”可是她却帮不上忙。“爱得越多，就越觉得无能为力。”她这样谆谆地说。她只能在曼彻斯特远远地观看她朋友的绚烂的生活万花筒，并将它和自己那充斥着无谓小事的平淡日子做比较。不过，虽然她自己的生活暗淡无光，不知为什么她不再嫉妒简的显赫的命运。

如果没有穆迪们出现，说不定她们俩会继续各在一方、有一搭没一搭地保持通信联系，尽管杰拉尔丁曾宣称：“这样写信送进茫茫空间，我已经厌烦死了，人们只是因长久别离才写信，写给自己，而不是给朋友。”杰拉尔丁所谓的“穆迪们和穆迪主义”在维多利亚时代淑女默默无闻的生活中起着重大的作用，虽然这类事几乎不见经传。这一次涉及的穆迪们是两个姑娘，伊丽莎白和朱丽叶——卡莱尔说她们是“浮华、招眼、自以为是、看去迟钝麻木的女孩子”。她们的父亲曾是邓迪镇的一名校长，他是个可敬的人，曾写过有关自然史的书，身后留下一个愚蠢的寡妇，几乎没有家产可维持生计。穆迪们不知怎么在很不方便的钟点到了禅恩巷，我们不妨设想，正好是在饭菜摆上了餐桌的时候。不过维多利亚时代的淑女倒不在乎——她们为帮助穆迪们不厌其烦。问题立刻摆在了卡莱尔太太面前：能怎么帮助她们呢？谁知道有什么职位？谁能说动个阔佬？杰拉尔丁闪进她的脑海。杰拉尔丁总是希望自己能派上点用场。应该问问杰拉尔丁在曼彻斯特是否有可以让穆迪们做的事由。杰拉尔丁果然不负期望，迅速地行动起来。她立刻“安置”了朱丽叶，不久后又为伊丽莎白打听到一个位置。正在怀特岛的卡莱尔太太马上给伊丽莎白备下了束胸、裙子和内衣，径直赶往伦敦，带着伊丽莎白穿过全城，在晚上7点半抵达尤斯顿广场，把她交给一位看上去心地善良的胖胖的老先生照看，并查看好给杰拉尔丁的信已经别到了伊丽莎白的束胸上。然后简就回家了，筋疲力尽，志得意满，然而，像所有信奉穆迪主义的人常常难以避免的，心里也暗自忐忑不宁。穆迪姐妹会快乐吗？她们会感激她做的这一切吗？几天以后，不可避免的臭虫出现在了禅恩巷，并被有理或无理地归咎于伊丽莎白的围巾。更糟的是，伊丽莎白本人4个月后又出现了。她证明了自己“完全不适合做任何实用的工作”，她曾经“用白线缝黑围裙”，而且，别人只是和颜悦色地责备了几句，她就“倒在厨房地板上又踢又叫”。“自然了，其结果是她立刻被解雇了。”伊丽莎白消失了——去用白线缝更多的黑围裙、又哭又叫再被解雇——有谁知道可怜的伊丽莎白·穆迪最后怎么样了呢？她彻底地从世界上消失了，在她的妇女姐妹们的生活阴影里被吞没了。不过朱丽叶还在。杰拉尔丁把朱丽叶当作自己的责任。她又是监督又是劝告。第一个位置不令人满意。杰拉尔丁便亲自出动去给她另找工作。她出了门，坐到一个想请女用人的“身体僵直的老太太”的客厅里。那位僵直的老太太说她要让朱丽叶清理、浆洗衣领，熨袖头，并洗、熨内衣。朱丽叶的心撑不住了。她喊道，她可干不了这些个洗呀浆呀熨呀的。于是杰拉尔丁大晚上的再次出马，见了老太太的女儿。说定了内衣被“除去”，只有领子和花边由朱丽叶熨烫。然后杰拉尔丁再去找她自己的帽商，商定由她教朱丽叶制边和修饰的手艺。卡莱尔太太和善地给朱丽叶写信并寄给她一个包裹。如此这般还有更多的位置和更多的麻烦，更多的老太太，更多的面试洽谈，直到后来朱丽叶写了一部小说。有位绅士高度赞扬了那本小说，朱丽叶还对朱斯伯里小姐说，另有一位绅士从教堂跟踪她回家，让她不胜苦恼；不过她总还是个好姑娘，大家都说她的好话。直到1849年情况突然变了，没有任何解释，穆迪中硕果仅存的一位就再也不被提起了。毫无疑问，沉默意味着另一个失败。那小说，那僵直的老太太，那绅士、那些帽子，内衣和浆洗——她毁灭的原因到底是什么？内情没有披露。“那些倒霉的愣冲冲的木头脑瓜子，”卡莱尔写道，“尽管别人用尽了力气费尽了口舌，他们还是在劫难逃地愣头愣脑径直向前冲，一条道朝下走向沦落，直到最后从视野里完全消失。”尽管她再三努力，卡莱尔太太最后不得不承认穆迪主义总是以失败告终。

然而穆迪主义也有意想不到的后果。穆迪主义把简和杰拉尔丁重新拉到了一起。简不能否认，“那堆软蓬蓬的羽毛”——简曾以她的方式用许多轻蔑的字眼描述杰拉尔丁，以博卡莱尔一笑——“以更胜我一筹的热情担起了这事”。杰拉尔丁不止有软绒毛，也有硬沙砾。因此，当杰拉尔丁将她的第一部小说《佐薇》的手稿送到卡莱尔太太手中以后，后者便发动自己去找出版商（“因为，”简写道，“如果她年老时既没有亲友，也没有生活目标，她会怎么样呢？”），而且获得了出乎意料的成功。贾普曼及豪尔书局立即同意出版，他们的阅稿人报告说，该书“如铁爪般牢牢地抓住了他”。那部书曾酝酿了很久。在写作的各个阶段都征求过卡莱尔太太本人的意见。她读最初的草稿时“几乎怀着惊骇之感！如此巨大的才气这样无节制地涌向陌生的空间”。但她也被深深地感动了。

在这里杰拉尔丁特别显示出她是一个远比我想象得更深刻、更大胆的思考者。我想，现时大概没有别的哪个活着的女人，哪怕是乔治·桑本人，能写出这本书里的那些最精彩的段落……但他们可不能出版这本书——礼数不容！

卡莱尔太太责难说，杰拉尔丁的书中有一种“精神领域内的缺乏节制”或不合规矩，这是可尊敬的公众绝不能容忍的。杰拉尔丁大约同意做些修改，虽然她坦白地说她“不善于对付得体不得体之类的事”；书又重新改写了，最后于1845年2月面世。通常难免的纷纭的议论和相左的见解立刻接踵而来。有的人热烈赞扬，有的人震惊不已。改革俱乐部的老、少登徒子们几乎因它的不体面而歇斯底里大发作。出版商受了点惊吓，但是丑闻促进了销售，杰拉尔丁变成了女名人。

当然了，如今你要是翻翻这三卷纸页发黄的小书，不免会奇怪当初人们为什么要赞美或非议它，不明白那些铅笔划痕中带着怎样的一时迸发的愤怒或赞美，又是怎样神秘的激情，使得那如今已经变得像墨水一样黑的紫罗兰花被夹进了描写恋爱场面的书页间。一章又一章文字亲善、顺畅地溜过。朦朦胧胧中我们瞥见了一个名叫“佐薇”的私生女，看到她那身为天主教神父的神秘莫测的父亲埃弗哈德；见到乡间的一座城堡；还有倚在天蓝色沙发上的淑女、大声朗读的绅士和在丝绸上绣心形图案的姑娘们。有火灾发生。有林间的拥抱。有无止歇的长谈。佐薇动摇了那位神父的信念，他大声感慨地说“真愿从不曾来到世间”，说完挥手把教皇吩咐他编辑l世纪至4世纪早期教会领袖主要著作译本的信函，和装有戈丁根大学的金链的小包扫进抽屉里，那真是个动人心弦的时刻。可是哪里有让改革俱乐部的爷们儿震惊得不成体统的内容，何处可见让卡莱尔太太那样敏锐的知识者为之心动的卓著的才华，我们实在无从猜想。80年前艳若玫瑰的色彩如今褪得只剩淡淡的粉红，所有的芳香和气味都消散了，只留下凋残的紫罗兰或陈年头油的一丝轻微余韵，到底是哪一种我们也说不准。我们惊呼，短短若干年时光的力量能造就这样的奇迹！但就在我们感叹之时，我们远远地看出了一些他们所指的过分之处或杰出天才的蛛丝马迹。激情，就从活人口中表达出的激情而言，已经消耗殆尽了。佐薇们、克罗蒂尔德们和埃弗哈德们在他们的位置上朽败了，然而和他们同在一室的却还另外有人；一个无拘无束的灵魂，如果考虑到她被裙衬和紧身胸衣拖累，你就可以说她是一位大胆而机灵的女性；她苦苦渴念，絮絮述说，多愁善感到荒唐的地步，但尽管如此，仍是独具一格，生气勃勃。我们发现不时有个句子大胆地迸出，或有某个念头巧妙地生成。“如果能不借助宗教而行义事，该有多好！”“啊，如果神父和讲道者真的相信他们宣讲的每句话，他们中还能有哪个人夜能安寝！”“软弱是唯一没有希望的状态。”“恰当地爱是人类所能达到的最高的道德。”而且，她是多么憎恨“男人们的那些简洁精练、头头是道的理论”！生命是什么？为什么将它赋予我们？这些问题、这些信念仍在掠过那些在各自位置上糟朽的人的脑海。他们死了，但是杰拉尔丁·朱斯伯里仍然活着，独立自主，勇敢无畏，荒唐无稽，她马不停蹄地写了一页又一页，顾不上停笔修改，不管有哪些人听得到，她只管叼着一支烟滔滔地道出自己关于爱、道德、宗教、两性关系的种种见解。

在《佐薇》出版之前的某个时候，卡莱尔太太或是忘记了或是克服了她对杰拉尔丁的不满，原因之一是因为后者曾如此古道热肠地为穆迪们奔走；此外也因为杰拉尔丁的辛苦张罗使她“几乎重新相信了自己原有的幻觉，认为她对我怀有某种古怪的、热烈的……不可思议的眷恋”。她不仅重新被卷入书信往来，而且，1844年7月里，她在利物浦附近的西佛斯宅又再次和杰拉尔丁同住到一个屋檐下——尽管她曾多次发誓再也不干这种事了。没过多少天，卡莱尔太太关于杰拉尔丁强烈依恋于她的“幻觉”就被证明根本不是什么幻觉，而是可怕的事实。有一天早上两人闹了点小小的别扭，于是杰拉尔丁整整一天拉着脸；晚上她跑到卡莱尔太太的卧室闹了一场，这“对我来说是个启示，不仅有关杰拉尔丁；更关乎人类天性！我从来没有想到过，一个女人会为另一个女人生出如此疯狂的恋人般的嫉妒心”。卡莱尔太太愤恨、气恼、心怀轻蔑。她把此事经过的详细描绘留下款待她的丈夫。几天后，她公开地羞辱了杰拉尔丁，她说：“她整晚上当着我的面和另一个男人谈情说爱，真奇怪，她居然还指望我此后仍会体面地对待她！”所有在场的人顿时哗然大笑。伤害必定很严重，出丑无疑很痛苦。但是杰拉尔丁是不可救药的。一年以后她又生气发火了，并声称她有权利发火——“因为她比全世界别的人都更爱我。”于是卡莱尔太太起身回答道：“杰拉尔丁，等到你能表现得像个淑女再说。”随即离开了屋子。然后就是杰拉尔丁又一次的流泪、道歉和保证悔改。

然而，尽管卡莱尔太太又是责骂又是嘲笑，尽管她们有了隔阂，尽管有一段时间她们不再通信，她们总是重又会面。杰拉尔丁显然觉得简在各方面都比她更聪明、更完善、更坚强。她依赖于简。她需要简帮助她摆脱困境；因为简从来没有让自己陷入困境。不过，虽然简比杰拉尔丁要聪明机智得多，但有时候出主意发忠告的却是那个比较愚蠢和不负责任的杰拉尔丁。你干吗，她问，要浪费你的时间补旧衣服？干吗不做些真正能使你的精力得到利用的事？写东西吧，她向简进言说。因为，杰拉尔丁确信：简是那么深刻，那么深思远虑，她写的东西一定能帮助妇女“应付她们的错综复杂的责任和困难”。简欠同性别的人这份贡献。不过，这个大胆的女人接着说，“别去卡莱尔先生那儿求同情，别让他给你泼凉水。你必须尊敬自己的工作，以及你自己的动机”——其实简本来是该实行这一劝告的，她曾因害怕卡莱尔先生反对而不敢接受杰拉尔丁的新小说《隔山姐妹》的献词。在某些方面那个小家伙是两人中更勇敢更自立的一个。

杰拉尔丁还具有一种素质——一种诗情，一种神驰八极的想象力，而这是出类拔萃的简所没有的。杰拉尔丁翻阅古书，抄下有关阿拉伯的棕榈树和肉桂树的浪漫段落，并把它们寄出，让它们很不协调地出现在禅恩巷的早餐桌上。简的才能自然是截然相反的一种：它是正面的、直接的、实用的。她的想象聚焦于人。她的书信精彩绝伦，是因为她的思维像鹰隼般盘旋并径直向事实俯冲。没有什么能逃过她的眼睛。她透过明澈的水直视底下的岩石。但她抓不住无形的事物；她对济慈的诗一笑置之；在她身上，苏格兰乡村医生女儿的某些狭隘拘谨的特征一直未能消去。杰拉尔丁虽然在机巧精明上逊色一筹，但有时思想却更开阔一些。

她们如此这般相互同情又相互厌恶，以富于弹性的方式永远地联系在一起。她们之间的纽带可以无限地拉长却并不断裂。简明白杰拉尔丁能有多么蠢；而杰拉尔丁深知简的舌头何等刻毒。她们学会了彼此容忍。自然了，她们还要争吵；然而她们的争吵也已经不同以往了；现在她们的争吵是明知最终还要修好的吵嘴。杰拉尔丁的兄弟1854年结婚后，她移居到伦敦，依照卡莱尔太太本人的意愿住到了卡莱尔家附近。那个在1843年看来永远不可能再是朋友的女人如今是简在世界上最亲密的朋友。她的住所将在两条街外；说不定相隔两条街就是她们之间恰到好处的距离。相距遥远时情深意切的友谊会生出无数误会；而同住一所房子又会彼此不堪重负。但如果隔街而居，她们的关系就会拓展并简化；就会变成一种自然的交往，友谊的波澜和宁静都以深切相知为基础。她们一起出门。她们一道去听《弥赛亚》，两人的表现合乎各自的禀性：杰拉尔丁因优美的音乐而落泪；而简一方面因杰拉尔丁哭泣而想去推她，同时又因合唱队的女人太丑自己也想哭一场，最后好不容易才控制住了这两种冲动。她们到诺伍德去游玩，杰拉尔丁把一条丝帕和一个铝胸针（“巴罗先生送的爱的信物”）丢在了旅社，把新绸伞落在了候车室。简还带着讥讽的满足感记述道：杰拉尔丁努力节约，买了两张二等车票，然而回程一等票的价格其实和二等票完全是一样的。

同时，杰拉尔丁躺在地板上，归纳，玄想，并力图从自己动荡的生活经历中提炼出某些人生哲理。“多么可恨”（她的语言常常偏于强烈——她知道自己经常“违背了简对良好品味的看法”），在许多方面女人的处境是多么可恨！她自己就曾怎样精神伤残、发育不良！面对男人主宰女人的权力她是怎样热血沸腾！她很想踹某些绅士几脚——“那些撒谎的伪善的瘪三！当然啦，骂人没什么用处——不过，我太气愤了，骂出来能让我平静一些。”

然后她的念头又转向了简和她自己，以及那些超群出众却没有产生多少看得见的成果的才俊们——无论如何至少简是才华出众的。然而，除非是在生病的时候，平素——

我认为你我都不能被算作是失败者。我们是尚未被承认的女性人格发展的标志。迄今，这种发展尚无现成的路可循，但我们还是寻觅并尝试了，发现那些为女性设置的规矩并不适合我们，我们需要更好的、更有力的原则……我们之后还会有别的女人，她们会在更大程度上充分实现妇女天性的发展。我只把自己看作是一个暗淡的标记，一种初步的思想雏形，指向妇女内在的更高的品质和潜能，我的所有的怪癖、错误、不幸和荒唐，只是不完美的塑造过程和不成熟的成长发育的后果。

她这样理论着，思索着；而卡莱尔太太则在一边倾听，她无疑要哂笑，要驳斥，但肯定是同情多于讥诮。她可能希望杰拉尔丁更确切些，她可能希望杰拉尔丁的语言更有节制。卡莱尔随时都可能进来；如果说卡莱尔恨什么人的话，那就是“乔治·桑式”的意志坚强的女人。但是她不能否认杰拉尔丁的话里有某些真理；她一直认为杰拉尔丁“生来或将有所摧毁，或将有所创建”。杰拉尔丁看上去有点痴，但绝不是傻瓜。

然而杰拉尔丁到底想了什么说了什么，她的上午怎样度过，她在伦敦冬日里漫长的傍晚做些什么——实际上，构成她在马克姆广场的生活的所有的一切——我们都所知甚少，而且这一点点也大可怀疑。因为，恰如其分地，简的耀眼之光湮灭了杰拉尔丁那较为暗淡的摇曳的星火。杰拉尔丁不再需要给简写信。她在卡莱尔家里出出进进，有时因简的手指肿了而代她写信，有时拿信去投递却又忘了发出，她这类心不在焉的浪漫者正是干那种事的料。我们翻阅卡莱尔太太的信，感到在这两个性格不合但却又彼此深深依恋的女性的交往中，升起了某种有如小猫轻叫或壶水低鸣的居家度日的轻柔声响。最后，在1866年4月21日星期六那天，杰拉尔丁要帮助简办茶会。卡莱尔先生在苏格兰，卡莱尔太太希望趁他不在，以应有的礼数回报一些仰慕者。当弗劳德先生(7)突然来到杰拉尔丁家时，她正在为茶会更衣打扮。他刚刚从禅恩巷得了消息说“卡莱尔太太出事了”。杰拉尔丁披上斗篷。他们一道匆匆赶到圣乔治医院。在那里，弗劳德写道，他们看到卡莱尔太太穿得像平时一样美丽：

就像她是下了马车后坐在床上小憩，然后躺下睡了……那种精彩的嘲讽神情，以及与嘲讽交替出现的温柔，都已消失不见。面容呈现一种严峻庄重的平静。……（杰拉尔丁）说不出话。

我们再也无法打破那沉默。缄默日益加深，变成了彻底的无言。简死后杰拉尔丁搬到塞文欧克斯居住。她在那里独自住了21年。人们说她失去了活力。她不再写书。她得了癌症，吃了很多苦头。濒临死亡之际她开始遵照简的愿望撕毁简的信，到临终时她已经把所有的信都毁了，只剩下一封。这样，就像她的生活曾在幽暗中开始一样，如今它又在幽暗中结束了。我们知之甚详的，仅仅是中间的短短几年。不过，我们也别对“知之甚详”太自信。相知是一种艰难的艺术，如杰拉尔丁提醒我们：

哦，亲爱的（她写给卡莱尔太太），如果你我溺水或死去，碰上什么更高明的人写我们的“生活和失误”，我们会成什么样子呢？一个“忠实不欺”的人将怎样把我们写得一团糟，却与我们过去和现在的实际情况大相径庭！

杰拉尔丁不讲究语法的口语化的冷嘲热讽像往常一样包含真理，它的回音从她在布朗普顿茔地摩根夫人墓穴的下葬处一直传到我们耳中。

“我是克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂(1)”


今年12月5日，克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂将庆祝她的百年诞辰。更确切地说，是我们将纪念她的百年诞辰。这在她本人来看恐怕是件相当窘惑的事。她是位最腼腆的女性，对她来说，被人议论——我们少不了要议论她——是极为难堪的。然而这一切无可避免；百年诞辰是铁面无情的，我们非谈论她不可。我们将阅读她的传记和书信，研究她的肖像，猜测她的病症——她的病可不少，并希望稀里哗啦地翻她的那些大多空着的书桌抽屉。让我们从传记开始吧——有什么能比传记更有趣呢？人人都知道，传记的魔力是不可抵御的。我们一翻开桑达斯小姐的审慎而精彩的传记（《克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂传》，玛丽·弗·桑达斯著，哈钦森公司），立刻就陷进旧时的幻境，呈现出的是被神奇地封存于魔箱之中的往昔和那时的人们。我们只需看看听听，听听看看。不一会儿那些小人儿——他们确实小于常人的身量——就会开始讲话并活动。他们的行动得服从我们为他们做出的种种安排，但他们却毫无所知，因为他们活着的时候以为自己想去哪里就能去哪里。当他们开口时，我们便赋予他们的话语各种各样的意义，他们对此却浑然不觉，因为他们活着的时候相信自己不过脱口讲出了一闪之念。不过，一旦你进入传记，情形就全然不同了。

好了。这里是伦敦波特兰地区的哈勒姆街。大约在1830年，这儿居住着罗塞蒂一家。他们是意大利人，家里有父亲、母亲和4个小孩儿。街道一点儿也不繁华，房子也相当破旧。不过贫困倒不大要紧，因为他们是外国人，所以不必像一般英国中产阶级家庭那样小心顾及习俗和常规。他们自成一统，靠授课、写作和别的零星工作维持生计，穿着随便，还招待意大利的流亡者，其中包括在街头拉手风琴的以及其他各式各样倒霉的同胞。渐渐地，克里斯蒂娜从家庭成员中凸现了出来。她显然是个善于观察的沉静的孩子，脑子里已经有了一套关于生活的想法——她打算写作——不过她因此而愈加敬重她兄长的杰出的才能。不久我们就开始为她安排几个朋友，赋予她某些特征。她鄙视社交晚会，不在乎穿戴。她喜欢哥哥的朋友，以及年轻的艺术家和诗人的小聚会。他们想改造世界，这让她觉得怪有趣的。因为，虽说她很文静，却相当古怪任性，喜欢笑话那些把自己看得无比重要的人。她虽然想当诗人，却不像一般年轻诗人那样紧张、虚荣，她的诗好像是在她的头脑中完整地自行生成的。她不太在意别人怎么评议它们，因为她心里知道它们是好诗。她极善于萌发敬爱——比如对她那沉静睿智、朴实诚挚的母亲，或对她的姐姐玛丽亚。玛丽亚不怎么喜欢绘画或诗歌，但因此在日常生活中却更生气勃勃，务实干练。比如说，玛丽亚从不参观大英博物馆的木乃伊展室。她说，复活之日随时可能来临，如果那些尸体将不得不在观众面前进入永生，未免太不相宜了。克里斯蒂娜从来没想到这点，觉得这念头似乎很了不起。这时，我们这些身处魔箱之外的人免不了要开心地笑笑，可克里斯蒂娜在那魔箱里头，被其中的温度和潮流所影响，认为她姐姐的行为是极可尊敬的。如果我们更仔细一点地观察她，就会发现，在她的生命的中心已经形成了某种黑暗而坚实的东西，宛如一个内核。

这内核自然是宗教信仰。当她还是个小姑娘的时候，灵魂和上帝的关系就开始使她着迷，后来这成为她终身的关注。她一生的64年表面上看似乎是在哈勒姆街、恩兹莱花园和托灵顿广场度过的，但实际上她生活在某个奇异的界域中，在那里灵魂挣扎着要接近看不见的上帝——就她而言，这上帝是阴暗的、严厉的，他宣布说世间所有的快乐都是可憎的。剧院是可憎的，歌剧是可憎的，裸体是可憎的。她的朋友汤普森小姐画了一些裸体形象，只好对克里斯蒂娜说她们是些天仙，可克里斯蒂娜看穿了朋友的谎言。克里斯蒂娜生命中的一切都是从那纠结着痛苦和激情的内核中焕发出来的。信仰决定着她生活中最微末的细节。它教导她说下棋是错误的，但打打扑克牌却无伤大节。它还干预她心目中的那些顶顶重要的问题。有一位叫詹姆斯·科林森的青年画家。她爱科林森，科林森也爱她。但他是罗马天主教徒，因此她拒绝和他结婚。科林森为了顺应她，改信了英国国教，她就表示同意了。不过他立场不怎么坚定，徘徊不决，后来又皈依了天主教，于是克里斯蒂娜毅然取消了婚约，尽管这使她肝肠欲断，含恨终生。多年以后，幸福的前景再一次出现在她面前，其基础也似乎较为牢靠一些。查尔斯·凯利向她求婚了。这位耽于理论的饱学之士心不在焉、身着便装地满世界跑，把福音书译成伊洛郭亦族(2)语言，在晚会上询问漂亮的女士们“是否对墨西哥暖流感兴趣”，还曾送给克里斯蒂娜一只用酒精浸泡保存的海老鼠做礼物。不过，理所当然，他是个不信教的自由思想者。他也遭到了拒绝。虽然她“爱他之深，超过世上所有女人的爱情”，可她不能做一个怀疑论者的妻子。尽管她爱那些“有毛皮的傻东西”——爱世上的袋熊、蛤蟆和老鼠——并把查尔斯·凯利称作“我的最瞎最瞎的老鹰，我的特别的鼹鼠”，却不允许鼹鼠、袋熊、老鹰或凯利进入她的天堂。

我们可以永远这样看下去，听下去。封存在魔箱中的过去包含无穷无尽奇特、好玩、古怪的事物。不过，正当我们思量着下一步该探查这奇异领域中的哪条裂隙时，主要人物起而干预了。好像一条鱼，我们在它毫无知觉的情况下看它环游，看它在水草中进进出出，围绕石头转来转去，可现在它却突然猛撞玻璃，把鱼缸撞破了。起因是一次茶会。由于某种缘故，克里斯蒂娜参加了弗丘·泰布思太太举办的聚会。我们不知道到底发生了什么事，也许有人随便地、漫不经心地、以茶会闲聊的方式就诗歌发表了一点什么高见。不管怎样——

一个小个子女人猛然从座椅上站起来，走到屋子中间，郑重地宣布说：“我是克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂！”说毕，便回到她的椅子上。

此语一出，玻璃碎裂。是的，（她似乎在说，）我是个诗人。你们这些装模作样地纪念我诞辰的人并不比参加泰布思太太茶会的懒散庸人高明。虽说我愿让你了解的一切都摆在这里，你们却只是徜徉于无聊的琐事，翻我的书桌抽屉，拿玛丽亚和木乃伊以及我的恋爱事件寻开心。看看这本绿皮的书。它是我的诗集，标价四先令六便士。读读吧。然后她就回到自己的座位上去了。

这些诗人真绝，真不肯通融！他们说，诗歌与生活无关。木乃伊与袋熊，哈勒姆街和公共马车，詹姆斯·科林森和查尔斯·凯利，海老鼠和弗丘·泰布思太太，托灵顿广场和恩兹莱花园，甚至宗教信仰引发的奇行异想都不重要，都是外在的、表面的、不真实的。重要的只有诗。唯一值得关心的问题是诗，好不好？但我们不妨指出，哪怕只是为了拖延一点时间，有关诗的这个问题是极难弄明白的。自从开天辟地以来，对诗的议论中有价值的不多。当代人的评价几乎总是错的。比如说，《克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂全集》中出现的大多数作品都曾被编辑们退稿。很多年里她写诗的收入大约为每年十英镑。与此对应，如克里斯蒂娜讥讽地指出的，吉恩·英格洛(3)的诗歌却一连印了八版。当然了，在她的同代人里，也有一两位诗人、一两位批评家的意见是值得认真参考的。不过他们对同一些作品又似乎产生了全然相异的印象——他们借以评判的标准是那么不同！比如说，史文朋(4)读她的诗时曾惊呼道“我一向认为，再没有比这更辉煌的诗作了”，并进而说她的《新年颂》——

仿佛烘衬在火焰里，仿佛沐浴在阳光下，仿佛应和着竖琴和风琴所不能企及的回流的海之乐的弦音和节奏，是天堂明澈而嘹亮的潮声的回响。

学识渊博的圣茨伯里(5)教授也考查了《魔市》，并说道：

最恰当地说，主要诗作（《魔市》）的格律可被形容为非打油诗化的“斯克尔顿体”，集斯宾塞(6)以来各种格律程式的音乐之大成，取代了乔叟的后继者们的沉闷刺耳之声。从该诗中可以辨别出追求不规则诗行的趋向，该倾向在其他时期里，如在17世纪末18世纪初的“品达罗斯体”诗歌，以及赛耶斯早期的或阿诺德后期的无韵诗里也有流露。

此外还有沃尔特·雷利爵士(7)——

我认为她是目前活着的最优秀的诗人。……可惜的是你无法讲授真正纯粹的诗，就像无法谈论纯净的水的成分——容易讲述的是兑了水、掺了甲醇、混有泥沙的诗。读了克里斯蒂娜，我唯一想做的事是哭泣，而不是讲课。

由此看来至少有三种批评流派：回流的海之乐派；不规则诗行派和否定评论、力主哭泣派。这实在令人困惑。如果我们同时追随他们，到头来只能以苦恼收场。也许倒不如自己读自己的，不抱先入之见地接受诗歌，并把它引起的反响录述下来，尽管它们只是一时之感，并不完善。如果这样做，我们的感受可能会如下面所述：啊，克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂，我得谦卑地承认，我虽然熟知你的许多诗，但没有从头到尾读完你的诗集。我没仔细考察过你的经历和发展过程。我很怀疑你的创作到底有多少发展。你是靠直觉写诗的。你总是从同一个角度看世界。岁月以及与人们和书本进行思想交流对你丝毫没有影响。你小心地回避了可能动摇你信仰的书籍以及可能扰乱你直觉的人们。说不定这是聪明的做法。你的直觉是那么准确、那么直接、那么强烈，它所催生的诗像音乐一样在人们的脑子里回响——像莫扎特的旋律或格鲁克的曲调。你的诗虽然均衡对称，却是复杂的歌。当你拨动竖琴时，许多的琴弦同时响起。像所有直觉者一样，你对人寰的视觉美有强烈的感受。你的诗中满是金色的尘和“浓浓淡淡的明媚的天竺葵”；你的双眼不断地注意到灯芯草有怎样的“天鹅绒般的头”，蜥蜴有怎样的“奇异的金属般的甲”——你观察事物时那种“拉斐尔前派”的强烈官能快乐，恐怕一定曾使作为英国国教高教会派(8)教徒的克里斯蒂娜大为吃惊吧。然而你的缪斯的悲哀和执着却来自你的信仰。至诚信仰的压力包围着、挤压着你那些小小的诗歌。也许这些诗的坚实性得自于那信仰，至少可以肯定其中的悲哀源于此——你的上帝是严厉的，你的天堂的桂冠由荆棘编成。每当你的眼饱餐世间的美，你的头脑就会立刻告诫你：美是虚幻的，美是短暂的。死亡、忘却和安息用它们黑色的波浪包裹着你的歌。有时也会听到与此不协调的疾走声和大笑声、动物的爪脚的啪嗒声、乌鸦古怪的喉音，以及有毛皮的憨傻动物们闻闻嗅嗅的哼哼声。因为，无论如何，你不是个完全的圣人。你会拽拽它们的腿，拧拧它们的鼻子。你反对一切欺瞒和伪装。你虽然谦虚，但仍尖锐，相信自己的天赋和眼光。你剪修自己的诗毫不手软，验证其乐感时无比敏锐。没有任何松散的无关多余物拖累你的诗篇。一言以蔽之，你是个艺术家。因此，即使你只是写着玩玩儿，只是摆弄铃铛消遣消遣，你也仍然为驾火降临者(9)的到来保持一条通路，他不时来访，使你的诗行融合一体，牢不可分：

请带给我洋溢着倦怠的死亡的罂粟

以及窒杀它所缠绕的生命的常春藤

还有那对月开放的草樱花。

事物的构成如此怪异，诗的奇迹如此辉煌。甚至当阿伯特纪念碑(10)已化为泥尘之时，你在小小的后屋里涂写的几首诗却仍将被认为均衡对称，无可挑剔。我们遥远的子孙后代将会吟唱：

当我死去的时候，亲爱的，

或者

我的心像小鸟啼啭歌唱。

那时托灵顿广场说不定已变成了珊瑚礁，鱼儿在当年你卧室窗子所在的地方游进游出；或者，说不定森林会重新覆盖人行道，袋鼠和食蜜獾将嗅来嗅去，迈着轻柔胆怯的步子穿行那湮没了道道围栏的纠结的青青蓁莽。想到这些，再回到你的传记，倘若弗丘·泰布思太太举办茶会时我也在场，而有一位身着黑衣的小个子的年长女人站起来走到屋子中间，我一定会出于热忱而笨拙地做出什么莽撞的事——折断裁纸刀或打碎茶杯。我会满怀敬仰地听她说：“我是克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂。”

《简·爱》与《呼啸山庄》


自从夏洛蒂·勃朗特诞生以来，100年过去了(1)，她已经成为这么多传说、热爱和著述的中心，但是她自己只活了39岁。假如她能活到一般人那么大的岁数，这些传说又会有什么变化，想一想倒也怪有趣儿的。她也许会像同时代的某些名流那样，成为常在伦敦和别的什么地方出头露面的人物，成为无数的图画和轶事的主题，成为许多部小说以及回忆录的作者，但是跟我们难免有些疏远，只作为一位声名显赫的中年人留在我们的记忆里。她也可能很富裕吧，也可能诸事顺遂吧。但事实还不是这样。我们一想到她，就能想象出一个在现代世界中命运不佳的人，就得让我们的头脑退回到上个世纪的50年代，退回到约克郡(2)的偏僻荒原上的那座牧师住宅。而她就一直待在那座住宅里、那片荒原上，既受过穷也受过捧，但是永远不幸，永远寂寞。

这些情况既然影响了她的性格，想必也要在她的作品当中留下痕迹吧？我们想，一位小说家，自然要靠着许许多多难以经久的材料来构筑他的作品，这些材料一开始虽能给他的作品增添真实性，到后来可就要变成累赘无用的东西了。当我们又一次打开《简·爱》，心里禁不住犯疑：她用自己的想象所创造出来的会不会只是一个陈旧的、过时的、维多利亚中期的世界，就像荒原上的那座牧师住宅，只有好事者才去参观，只有虔诚者才会保存呢？我们就是抱着这种心情打开《简·爱》的。可是，读了两页，一切疑虑都一扫而光了：

“起着皱褶的猩红色帐幔遮住我右方的视线；左边，明净的窗玻璃保护着我，却不能使我与那阴凄凄的11月的白天隔离。一面翻动着书页，我不时抬起头来审视这冬日下午的景色：远处呈现出一派灰蒙蒙的雾霭；眼前是湿淋淋的草地和正被风吹雨打的灌木丛，而那绵绵不停的雨，在久久哀号的狂风吹送下，‘刷、刷、刷’地飘向远方。”(3)

再没有什么东西比书里的荒原更经久，比那“久久哀号的狂风”更容易受到气流的支配而变幻不定了。同样，还有什么东西比这种兴奋状态更为短暂易逝呢？但它竟然催着我们一口气把书读完，不容有时间思考，不容我们的眼光离开书页。我们被小说如此强烈地吸引，假如有人在房间里走动，那动作也好像是发生在约克郡，而不像是在你的房间里。作者拉住我们的手，迫使我们跟她一路同行，让我们看她所见到的一切；她一刻也不离开我们，不许我们把她忘记。最后，我们就完全沉浸在夏洛蒂·勃朗特的天才、激情和义愤之中了。与众不同的面孔，轮廓突出、相貌乖戾的人物，都在我们眼前闪现；但是，这些都是通过她的眼睛我们才能看见的。她一走开，这一切也就不复存在。想到罗切斯特(4)，我们同时也就想起简·爱。想到荒原，我们也不能不想起简·爱。甚至，再想一想书里的客厅，那些“好像覆盖着鲜艳的花环的白色地毯”，那只淡白色的巴洛斯壁炉，壁炉上那“红宝石一般鲜红的”波希米亚玻璃片，以及那“雪白与火红相间的混合色彩”——如果把简·爱撇开，这一切又算得了什么呢？

简·爱的缺点是不难寻找的。总是做家庭女教师，总是陷入情网——这在一个许多人既不当家庭女教师、又不爱什么人的世界里，毕竟是一个严重局限。与此相比，像奥斯汀或者托尔斯泰那样的作家笔下的人物都具有数不清的侧面。他们活得生气勃勃，对许多不同的人产生了错综复杂的影响，而这许多人就像镜子一样从多方面映照出他们的性格。他们随意在各处走动，不管作者是否在察看他们；在我们看来，他们生活于其中的世界是独立存在的，而这个世界一旦由他们形成，我们自己也可以进去见识一番。从个性的力量和眼界的狭窄来看，托马斯·哈代和夏洛蒂·勃朗特倒是互相接近的。但是，两个人的差别也很大。我们读《无名的裘德》(5)，不会急急忙忙一口气看到结尾——我们往往掩卷沉思，生出一连串题外的念头，在小说人物的周围造成一种疑问和讽喻的气氛，那是他们自己浑然不知的。尽管他们不过是些纯朴的农民，我们却不得不向他们提出种种事关重大的难题和疑问，因此，在哈代的小说里，最重要的人物仿佛就是那些无名的人。这种本领，这种推理的好奇心，夏洛蒂·勃朗特是一点也没有的。她并不想去解决那些人生问题；她甚至根本就没有觉察那些问题的存在；她的全部力量——那是愈受压抑就愈显示其强大的——都投入了这么一种断言之中：“我爱”，“我恨”，“我受苦”。

因为，凡是以自我为中心、受自我所限制的作家都有一种为那些气量宽宏、胸怀阔大的作家所不具备的力量。他们所感受到的印象都是在他们那狭窄的四堵墙里稠密地积累起来，并牢牢地打上了戳记的。他们的心灵所产生的一切无不带着他们自己的特征。他们很少从别的作家那里学习什么，即使采取一点儿什么，也消化不了。哈代和夏洛蒂·勃朗特的风格似乎都是拿一种生硬而庄重的报章文体做基础而形成的。他们笔下的散文往往板滞而不灵活。但是，他们两位通过长期专注的努力，对于自己的每一构思都要凝神细思，直至为它找出确切的语言，终于锻造出自己所需要的那种散文——它能把他们心灵所熔铸的形象原原本本地描摹出来，而且还具有自己独特的美、独特的力量、独特的敏锐。至少说，夏洛蒂·勃朗特有成就并不是靠着她读了很多书。她从来不会像职业作家写得那么顺溜，也不会像他们那样博采词汇、运用自如。“我无法满足于跟那些力量雄厚、心思细密、情趣高雅的人们互相交往，无论他们是男是女。”她如此写道，口气像是某外省报纸的社论作者；接着，她又恢复了自己那火辣辣、急切切的口吻，说：“除非我首先冲破传统矜持态度的外围工事，跨过自信的门槛，并在他们心中的炉火旁边赢得自己的地位。”她也恰恰就在那里找到了自己的地位；正是那内心之火的摇曳不定的红光照亮了她的书页。换句话说，我们读夏洛蒂·勃朗特的书，不是去找对于人物性格的细致观察——她的人物都是既生机盎然而又性格单纯的；不是去找喜剧性的情节——她的情节是既严酷而又粗糙的；不是去找关于人生的哲学观点——她的观点不过是一个乡村牧师女儿的浅见。我们读她的书，只是为了其中的诗意。或许，一切像她这样个性特强的作家都是如此吧。正如我们在实际生活中常说的：他们只要把门打开，别人就能把他们的一切看个一清二楚。在他们身上有一种桀骜不驯的气质，跟既定的事态总是格格不入——这促使他们渴望立即投入创作而不肯耐心观察。这样的创作热情，抛开半调子，排除小障碍，飞越那些常人琐事，一下子就抓住了作者自己也还说不大清楚的七情六欲。这使得他们成为诗人，即使他们想用散文写作，也不受任何约束。因此，艾米莉和夏洛蒂两人常常乞求大自然的帮助。她们都感到需要借助于某种比人的语言行为更为强大的象征力量来表达人性当中那许许多多还在沉睡的情感和欲望。夏洛蒂的最好的一部小说《维列特》就是用了一段关于暴风雨的描写来收尾的：“天空低垂，阴霾密布——一大片散乱的飞云自西方飘来；云彩幻化成为种种奇形怪状。”这样，她请大自然把无法用其他方法表达的心情描写出来。

但是，对于大自然，这姊妹俩哪一个也没有多萝西·华兹华斯(6)观察得那么准确，也没有丁尼生(7)描绘得那么细致。她们抓住的只是大地上某些跟她们亲身感受到或者转嫁在人物身上的东西非常近似的方面，因此，她们笔下的暴风雨、荒原、夏日的美好天气，都不是为了点缀一下枯燥的文字，或者显示作者的观察能力，而是用来贯通作者的情感，亮明书中的意图。

常常，一部书的意图既不在于发生了什么事，也不在于说了什么话，又不在于作者自己从那些各不相同的事物当中看出了什么联系，这么一来，了解起来自然很难。特别是当一位作家像勃朗特姊妹那样具有诗人的气质，他的意图和他的语言难解难分，而且只是一种情绪，并非什么细致的观感，要了解就更难了。《呼啸山庄》是一部比《简·爱》更为难懂的书，因为艾米莉乃是一个比夏洛蒂更加伟大的诗人(8)。夏洛蒂写作的时候，总是带着雄辩、光彩和激情说道：“我爱”，“我恨”，“我受苦”。她的感受虽是非常强烈，却和我们的感受处在同一个水平上。但是，在《呼啸山庄》里既没有“我”，也没有家庭女教师，又没有雇主。那里面有的是爱，但不是男女之间的那种爱。艾米莉的灵感来自某种更为广阔的构思。促使她创作的动力并不是她自己所受到的痛苦，也不是她自己所受到的伤害。她放眼身外，但见世界四分五裂、陷入极大混乱，自觉有力量在一部书里将它团在一起。这种雄心大志在整个小说里处处可以感觉出来——它是一场搏斗，虽然遭受挫折，仍然信心百倍，定要通过人物之口说出一番道理，那不仅仅是“我爱”，“我恨”，“我受苦”。而是“我们——整个人类”，“你们——永恒的力量……”但这句话并没有说完。情况如此，也不奇怪；令人惊奇的倒是她竟然能够使我们感觉出她心里想说的到底是什么。在凯瑟琳·恩肖(9)那只说出一半的话里所透露的便是这种心情：“如果别的一切都毁灭了，只要他还存在，我就能继续活下去；如果别的一切都还存在，而他却被毁灭了，那么，这个世界对于我来说就变得完全陌生，我似乎也就不再是它的一部分了。”(10)这种心情当着死者面前又一次流露出来：“我看到了那种无论人间、地狱都不能打破的安息，我也感到了对于那无穷尽、无阴影的来世的确信——相信他们已进入了永生——在其中，生命无限长久，爱情无限和谐，欢乐无限圆满。”(11)由于这部书暗示人性的种种表象下面所潜伏的力量能将它们提升到崇高的境界，这才使得它与其他小说相比具有自己的非凡高度。但是，对于艾米莉·勃朗特来说，仅仅写几首抒情诗，发出一声叫喊，表示一种信念，自然是不够的。因为，关于这件事，她在自己的诗歌里已经爽爽快快地做过了，而她的诗歌也许要比她的小说更能被久远传诵。然而，她不仅是诗人，还是小说家。她还得担负起一件吃力而又不讨好的任务。她必须正视别样的生存状态，与种种事物的表象结构打交道，要把农庄和房舍建造起来，像真的一样，让人一看便知，还要把在外界独立存在的男人女人的谈话记录下来。因此，我们得以攀登上这些感情的顶峰，不是由于什么豪言壮语，而是因为听见了一个女孩儿坐在树枝间一面摇摇荡荡、一面唱出了几支古老的歌曲，看见了荒原上的羊群正在啃吃草皮，倾听着柔和的风正在草间低语。农庄上的生活，连同其中发生的种种荒诞无稽、叫人难以置信的事情，都一下子揭开了。我们有了一切机会，可以将《呼啸山庄》与一座真正的农庄、将希斯克利夫(12)与一个真实的人物加以比较。我们可以问一问：既然这些男男女女跟我们自己看见的人如此不同，那么，真实性、洞察力，或者说细微的感情色彩又在哪里呢？可是，即使这样问了，我们仍然看到希斯克利夫毕竟是一个只有天才的姊妹才能识别出来的兄弟；我们可以说他叫人讨厌极了，然而，在文学领域中又有哪一个少年人物能像他这样生气勃勃地活着？大小凯瑟琳(13)也是这样；我们可以说：任何女人都不会像她们那样感受、那样行动的。但她们仍然是英国小说中最可爱的女人。作者似乎把我们所知道的人物的特征都撕个粉碎，然后再对这些无法辨认的碎片注入一阵强劲的生命之风，于是这些人物就飞越在现实之上。这是一种极其罕见的本领。她能把生命从其依托的事实中解脱出来；寥寥几笔，就点出一副面貌的精魂，而身体倒成了多余之物；一提起荒原，飒飒风声、轰轰雷鸣便自笔底而生。

切斯特菲尔德勋爵(1)的《教子书》


当马杭勋爵(2)编订切斯特菲尔德勋爵的书简的时候有必要提醒读者：这些信绝不适于让幼小者不加选择地阅读。只有“那些判断力业已确定、做人原则业已成熟的人”（勋爵阁下如此写道）才可以安心阅读它们。但是，这话是在1845年说的，而1845年从今天看来已经有点儿遥远了(3)。从我们今天看来，在那个时代，住宅高高大大，却没有浴室设备。人们要等厨娘就寝之后，才能到厨房里去抽烟。客厅里的桌子上摆着来宾签名簿。帷帐非常厚重，女人非常贞洁。然而，18世纪给人的印象也经历了一个变化。对于我们这些1930年的人来说，它比起维多利亚早期的那些年月，看上去好像反倒不是那么陌生、那么久远。18世纪的文化比起马杭勋爵及其同时代人的文化来说，好像更合理、更完满。在那个时候，至少还有一小部分具有高度文化教养的人按照某些理想标准安排自己的生活。他们的世界比较狭小，但也比较紧凑；它有自己的观念、自己的准则。当时的诗歌也浸透着这种安全感。我们只要读一读《卷发遇劫记》(4)，就会感到自己置身于这么一个安定而界限分明的时代，它是能产生出杰作名篇来的。我们暗自思量：在这种时代，诗人可以专心致志、全神贯注于自己的工作，因此，哪怕是某一位贵妇人梳妆台上的小盒子、小匣子，也都可以变成创作构思中的可靠材料。一局牌戏，夏日泰晤士河上的一次荡舟，都足以唤起我们的美感和事物的变化无常之感，正如我们从直接诉诸我们内心感情的那些诗篇所受到的启发一样。而且，既然诗人可以将自己的全部才华都用来描写一把剪刀、一绺卷发；那么，一位贵族，安然生活于自己的世界之中并对其中的价值标准视为理所当然，自然可以为教育自己的儿子制订出一套明确的方案。在那个世界中存在着为我们今天所不具备的明确性和安全感。由于种种原因，时代已经变了。我们现在阅读切斯特菲尔德勋爵的书简尽可不必脸红，或者说，尽管我们有时脸红，那也是因为我们在20世纪读到了某些片断而脸红，而它们在19世纪并不会使马杭勋爵感到什么不安。

这些书简刚开始写的时候，菲利普·斯坦霍普（切斯特菲尔德勋爵同一个荷兰家庭女教师所生下的私生子）还只是一个7岁的小男孩儿。要说我们对于这位父亲的道德说教有什么抱怨的话，那就是他的标准对于这么小的一个孩子来说未免太高了。“让我们回过头来谈一谈演说术，或者叫雄辩术吧——这是断不可以不加考虑的，”他向这个7岁男孩写道，“一个人不懂得它，就休想在议院、教会或司法界里显露头角。”他接着又如此说，仿佛这个小孩子已经在考虑自己的一生事业似的。看来，这位父亲的毛病（如果它算得是毛病的话）也正是那些显贵人物们的通病——他们自己在事业上没有获得应有的成功，便下决心要使自己的儿辈们（菲利普还是一个独生子）能够取得自己所缺少的机会。而且，书简一封封地写下去，我们还猜想得出：当切斯特菲尔德勋爵倾箱倒箧，谈出了自己的生平经历、读过的书、对世情的了解的时候，他不光是在教育儿子，也是在聊以自娱。这些书简流露出一种热情洋溢、生动活泼的情调，说明他给菲利普写信并不是苦差，而是乐事。也许，在部里办公腻烦了，宦途失意又使他把一切看穿，只有在这种自由自在的通信中才能舒一口气，所以，他竟忘了对方不过是一个小学生，对于乃父写给他的那些话，怕连一半儿也没有看懂。即使如此，在切斯特菲尔德勋爵关于那个陌生世界的描绘之中并没有东西使我们望而却步。他是全然站在节制、宽容和理性推论一边的。他忠告说，千万不可把某些团体里的所有的人都统统骂倒，各种教派的教堂都要去走一走，对于哪一个教派也不要嘲笑，对于一切事物都要有所了解。早晨，应致力于读书；夜晚，则可活动于有教养的社交场中。衣饰，要学上流人；举止，也要学上流人；不可怪癖，不可自私，也不可心神恍惚。要按照轻重缓急的原则办事，生活中每一瞬间都要过得充实。

这样，他一步步地塑造一个完人的形象。菲利普是可以变成这么一个人物的，只要他肯听从他父亲的劝告。这时候，切斯特菲尔德勋爵才说出了渲染着他全部说教的这么一句话——培养起一套礼数来。这些礼数一开始只是小心翼翼地藏在背人之处。在对待妇女和诗人方面，这个男孩的感情可以听其自然。切斯特菲尔德勋爵要求他尊敬这两种人。他写道：“至于我自己，当我过去同阿狄生先生和蒲柏先生(5)交往的时候，我仿佛是在陪同欧洲来的那些王公贵族似的，总觉得自己跟高出自己一头的人在一起。”但是，随着岁月流逝，品德渐渐变为想当然的存在，可以不必为它们操心了。然而，种种礼数却影响巨大。它们在世上支配着人的生活。它们的作用不容须臾忽视，而要求又非常严格。想一想，这种取悦于人的艺术究竟意味着什么吧。首先，你得学会怎样走进房间，又怎样从房间里走出来。由于人的胳膊腿儿总是别别扭扭地不听使唤，这还真要有点灵巧劲儿呢。其次，你得会打扮，衣服要穿得既十分入时而又不新得刺眼。牙齿要齐齐整整；假发要无懈可击；指甲要剪成圆弧形；要学会切肉，要学会跳舞，还要学会另一种同等重要的本领，那就是姿态优美地坐在椅子里。这种种事项便是取悦之道的入门。现在，再说说怎样讲话——我们至少得学会熟练地说三国语言。但是，在开口讲话之前，我们还要切记另一件事——千万警惕，不可笑出声来。切斯特菲尔德勋爵自己从不大笑。他总是微笑。后来，这个年轻人总算被宣称具有讲话的能力了，但他还得避免使用俗谚和鄙词；他讲话必须口齿清晰、文理精通；他不可争论，不可说故事，不可谈自己的事。最后，这个年轻人可以练习一下在取悦人的艺术当中最精致的一门艺术了——那就是巴结人的艺术。因为，每个男人、每个女人都有某种主要的虚荣心。要观察、等待，找出他们的弱点所在，那么，你就知道该拿什么样的诱饵放在你的渔钩上，好把他们钓住。这就是在世上成功的诀窍。

一说到这一点，由于我们的时代特点不同，我们就开始感到不舒服了。切斯特菲尔德勋爵关于成功的看法比起他关于爱情的看法更要大大叫人怀疑。因为，这样没完没了地下工夫克制自己，究竟目的何在呢？我们学会了怎样走进房间、走出房间，探听别人的秘密，闭口不谈自己，只去巴结别人，不跟下等人来往——免得堕落，不跟机灵人来往——免得被他们带坏，这又能捞点儿什么呢？什么是付给我们的奖赏呢？简单说来，就是——可以使我们飞黄腾达。若追问一下进一步的说明，也许是这么一个意思——那么一来，一个人就可以赢得上流人士的好感。但是，如果我们非要知道：这些上流人士到底是何等样人？我们可就要陷入一种错综复杂、有进无出的迷宫里了——而且，那里面还是空无一物的。什么是上流社会？那就是大人物们认为是上流的社会。什么是才智？那就是大人物们认为是聪明的东西。一切价值都取决于另外一个什么人的看法。因为，这种哲学的精义就在于事物都没有什么独立的存在，只存在于其他某些人的眼睛里，这是一个镜子世界，我们在里边儿慢慢地向上爬呀、爬呀，所得到的奖赏不过是种种的映象。这也说明了我们感到困惑不解的缘故，因为，我们在这些语气文雅的书简里翻过来翻过去，想要找到一点儿能抓在手里的实实在在的东西，可是终归徒然。实实在在的东西在这里是极难找到的。但是，即使有这种缺陷，又有多少为那些严峻的道德家们所不屑一顾的东西可以在这部书里发现；而且，谁又能够否认：至少说，当切斯特菲尔德勋爵还能吸引住他的时候，这些轻飘飘的玩意儿总还保持着一定的价值，而这些体面的礼数总还放射着一定的光辉呢？现在，再来看一看这些礼数给它们的忠实仆人，这位伯爵，带来了什么样的好处吧。

这是一位失意的政治家。他未老先衰，官丢了，牙齿也掉了；最倒霉的是，耳朵也一天一天不好使了。然而，他绝不许自己发出一声呻吟。他一点儿也不迟钝，不讨人嫌，不邋遢。他的思路就像他的身体一样，总是修饬得干净利落。他从不让自己在哪一秒钟“歪在躺椅里白白度过”。尽管这些是他的私信，并且显然只是信手写下的，但它们围绕着全部信件中的唯一题目，写得轻松流畅，一点儿也不叫人觉得乏味，而且，更怪的是，一点儿也不叫人觉得好笑。这也许因为取悦于人的艺术本来就跟写作艺术有点儿联系。礼貌、体贴、克制，收敛起自高自大，隐藏起个性而不把它强加于人，这些一方面固然对一位社会名流有好处，另一方面对一个写作的人也可能有一定的好处吧。

对于这种训练，无论我们如何解释，都有理由可以赞成，因为它还促使切斯特菲尔德勋爵写出一组《人物记》(6)。这些小品文像某种老式的小步舞那样，具有精细、严整的风格。然而，它们那匀称的结构又是作者自自然然形成的，只要他高兴，随时可以打破；因此，它绝不会像其他拟作那样流入局促、刻板。有时候，他也调侃、诙谐、使用警句，但他掌握火候，点到题目，立刻打住。当他提起乔治一世希望他那些情妇长得丰满时，写道：“有的做得恰到好处，有的把身体胀破了。”在另一篇里他又写道：“他被安置在上议院——那为不治的病人开设的疗养所。”他只是微笑，从不笑出声来。这当然也是18世纪的风气使然。切斯特菲尔德勋爵对于一切事物，甚至包括星象和贝克莱主教(7)的哲学，都抱着彬彬有礼的态度，但是，作为他那个时代的儿子，他绝不肯玩弄无限概念的游戏，或者揣想事物并不像表面上看去那么稳固。因为，就现状而论，这个世界已经够好，也够大了。这种缺乏诗意的性格使他安然处于毫无瑕疵的常识藩篱之内，同时也限制了他的眼光。他写不出一句响亮、深刻的话，像拉布吕耶尔(8)的许多警句那样。不过，他也许会第一个表示反对把他跟那位大作家进行类比。而且，如果一个人要像拉布吕耶尔那样写东西，他就得有一定的信仰，很难再遵守那些礼数了。他还要笑，要哭。而这两者又都是可悲叹的。

当我们为了自我消遣，谈论着这位有才气的贵族及其对人生的看法的时候，自然知道——这些书简相当大一部分吸引力就来自这种知觉——在通信的另一方还有一位默默无语却又确实存在的人物。菲利普·斯坦霍普始终不离我们眼前。他一句话也没有说，可我们能够觉察出他在德雷斯顿、在柏林、在巴黎怎样拆开这些信，细细地读，并且神情凄然地望着这些从他7岁开始一年一年愈积愈多的厚厚的邮件。他渐渐地长成为一个性格庄重、矮矮胖胖的青年。他对于外国政治发生了兴趣。他爱读点儿严肃的书籍。每趟邮车都给他送来语气温和、措辞优美、才气焕发的书简，恳求他、命令他要学会跳舞，学会切肉，想法子管住他的两腿，还要勾引住一位上流妇女。他都竭力照办了。他在这所礼数的学堂里发奋用功。可是这对他的要求太严了。他得沿着一层层的台阶向上攀爬，进入那座晶光闪亮、挂满镜子的大厅；但那些阶梯太陡峭了，他没有能够登堂入室，而是在半途停下了。他在下议院活动失败，到拉蒂兹本(9)担任一个小小的职务，而且，过早去世了。他让他的遗孀把他既硬不下心肠又缺乏勇气说出的那件事透露出来——他早跟一个出身卑微的姑娘结婚多年，而且生下了几个孩子。

伯爵像一位上流君子那样忍受住这一场打击。他给他儿媳写的那封信真是温文尔雅的典范。于是，他又开始对孙子们进行教育。但是，从此以后，他好像对于自己无论遭遇什么事情都感到无所谓了。甚至对于生死他也不大在乎了。但是，直到最后，对于礼数他仍是念念不忘的。他的临终遗言便是对于温雅女神所表示的崇敬的颂赞。在他弥留之际，有一个人进到了房间里。他撑起身子，说了一句：“给代洛尔(10)搬一把椅子来！”——然后，就永远沉默了。

《奥罗拉·李》


布朗宁夫妇(1)的肉身如今大出其名，可能远远超出他们在精神领域中的成就。对于世俗的这种嘲弄，布朗宁们大概也会会心地哂笑吧。一对狂热的情人——一个满头鬈发，一个两颊胡须，他们遭受压制，充满叛逆精神，最终私奔——这就是千千万万从来不曾读过他们的诗的人们所了解、所热衷的布朗宁夫妇。由于我们有撰写回忆录、出版信札、拍摄照片等现代风习，作家们如今以实体的形式存在着，而不是像过去只生存在词句中；如今人们凭借帽子、而不是像过去那样——通过诗来辨认他们。于是布朗宁夫妇成了那些生动活跃、名声显赫的作家中最引人注意的两位。摄影的艺术到底给文学的艺术带来了多大伤害还有待计量。当人们可以读到有关某一诗人的书时，他们还肯读多少诗人自己的作品，这是应该向传记家提出的问题。另一方面，没有人会否认布朗宁夫妇能引发我们的同情，唤起我们的兴趣。在美国的大学，一年里保不住有两位教授会瞥一眼《杰拉尔丁夫人的求爱》；可我们全知道那位斜倚病榻的巴雷特小姐，知道她如何在一个9月的早晨逃离了温波尔街的黑暗的家，又怎样在街道拐角处的教堂里和健康、幸福、自由的罗伯特·布朗宁相会了。

但对作家布朗宁夫人来说，命运待她却并不这么慈善。没有人读她的作品，没有人讨论她，没有人肯费心把她放到她应有的位置上。只要把她和克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂比较一下，就可看出她声誉衰微。克里斯蒂娜·罗塞蒂不可抗拒地攀升到英国一流女诗人的行列中。而伊丽莎白呢，虽然她生前得到了更为响亮的赞誉，现在却越落越远了。初级读本傲慢地将她拒之门外。他们说，现在，她的重要性“仅仅是历史性的。不论是教育，还是和她丈夫的关系，都未能使她懂得词语的价值或获得某种形式感”。总而言之，在文学大厦中唯一划定给她的地方是楼下仆人们的场所，在那儿和赫门兹太太、伊丽莎·库克、吉恩·英格洛、亚历山大·史密斯、埃德温·阿诺德，以及罗伯特·蒙哥马利之流做伴。她把碗碗罐罐敲得叮当作响，用刀尖扎起青豆大吃特吃。(2)

因此，即使我们把《奥罗拉·李》从书架上取下，我们也并不是当真想读它，而是带着慈悲的俯就之心玩味这往日时髦的代表物，就像把玩老祖母斗篷上的花边，或者端详当年装点她们桌子的印度泰姬陵石膏模型一样。不过，对于维多利亚时代的人来说，这本书无疑是十分珍贵的。至1873年，《奥罗拉·李》共印行了13版。而且，从题词看，布朗宁夫人不惮于承认她很重视这本书——她说：“这是我最成熟的作品，其中包含了我关于生活和艺术的最高的信念。”她的信件表明该作品曾经过多年的酝酿。当她初次见到布朗宁时就已在琢磨它，这对恋人所欣然共享的创作秘密中就包括她对该诗的形式的构思。

……我目前的主要心愿（她写道）是写一部诗体小说……触及我们传统中一些最根本的东西，深入“天使所不敢涉足”的客厅之类；剥去一切伪装，直面这个时代的人性，明白地道出真相。这就是我的心愿。

由于后来众所周知的原因，她心怀这一计划出逃，在幸福婚姻中度过了不凡的十年。当这本书终于在1856年出版时，布朗宁夫人完全有理由觉得她在其中倾注了自己所能提供的最好的一切。也许这长期的储藏和随之而来的浸润过程与等待我们的意外效果有关联。不管怎样，我们只消读前20页，就不能不感觉已被那老水手(3)——不知什么缘故，他徘徊在某一些书的庭前，却不出现在另外一些书的门口——抓住了，我们不由得像三岁小儿一样地倾听，而布朗宁夫人则在九大卷无韵素体长诗中滔滔不绝地讲述奥罗拉·李的故事。速度和生气、坦率和完全的自信——这些都是使我们心醉神迷的品质，它们使我们飘然欲仙。我们了解到奥罗拉的母亲是意大利人，“当奥罗拉刚刚4岁时，母亲那双罕有的蓝眼睛就已合上，再不能看到她”。她的父亲是个“严厉的英国人／在家乡度过多年枯燥的生活／在学院读书、埋头于法律和教区谈话／后来不知不觉间却突然被激情俘虏”。不过他也死了，于是孩子被送回英国由姑妈抚养。姑妈出身于李氏名门，她身着一袭黑衣，站在乡村宅第大厅前的台阶上迎接奥罗拉的到来。她的前额不宽，上面紧紧地盘着她那略显花白的褐色发辫；她的嘴线条柔和，但金口难开；眼睛说不出是什么颜色，面颊像夹在书页中的玫瑰花，“保留它更多的是出于怜悯，而不是由于愉悦——如果它不再是刚刚盛开，它也不能更枯萎凋零”。这位女士悄然隐居，把她的基督徒才华用于织袜子和钩内衣，“因为我们是血肉至亲，需要同样的衣衫”。在她的手里，奥罗拉吃足了人们所谓的适当的女子教育的苦头。她学了一点法语、一点几何；学了缅甸王国的国内法律，了解了有哪条通航河流通达拉腊、公元五年在克拉根福进行了什么人口普查，以及怎样描画身披整洁袍衣的海的女儿、怎样旋转镜片、怎样制作鸟标本、怎样用蜡做花等等。因为姑妈喜欢女人有个女人样儿。有一天晚上奥罗拉绣十字花，由于选错了丝线，绣出了个长着粉红眼睛的牧羊女。感情冲动的奥罗拉喊道：在这种女性教育的折磨下，一些女人死了，另一些在憔悴。少数像奥罗拉一样“与无形之存在有某种联系”的女性活了下来，目不斜视地行路，客客气气地应酬堂表亲戚，聆听牧师讲道并为人们斟茶倒水。奥罗拉本人很幸运，拥有一间小屋子，墙上是绿色的壁纸，地上有绿色的地毯，床边有绿色的床帷，好像是要和英格兰乡村的乏味的绿色相匹配。她在那小屋里躲清静；在那里埋头读书。“我发现了一个秘密，在一间阁楼里／满是写着我父亲名字的箱子／堆积如山，大包大捆／在那里，出出入入……像敏捷小鼠在古代巨象的骨骼间钻来钻去。”她读了一本又一本的书。事实上老鼠（布朗宁夫人的老鼠总是如此）在插翅高飞，因为，“当我们意气飞扬地忘却了自己／全心全意，一往无前地投入书的深渊／被其中的美、被真理的精华所激励——／这一刻，我们从书中真正得益”。她不停地读啊读啊，直到她的表哥罗姆尼来找她一道散步，或是画家文森·卡林顿来敲窗户。“男人们刻薄地认为那位画家有点癫狂，因为他认为如果画好了肉体，实际上就是画出了心灵。”

这样草草概括《奥罗拉·李》的第一卷自然不能反映其本来面貌；但如果我们像奥罗拉所劝告的，全心全意、一往无前地将原作吞读了这许多，就会发现很有必要尝试将许多纷纭的印象梳理一下。首先产生而且最突出的印象是作家本人的存在。透过人物奥罗拉的声音和故事中的情境，伊丽莎白·巴雷特·布朗宁的个性在我们耳际萦回。布朗宁夫人不会控制自己，也不会掩藏自己，这无疑标志着一个艺术家尚不完美，表明作家的生活对其艺术的影响超过了应有的程度。我们在阅读的时候一次又一次地感到，虚构的奥罗拉似乎在揭示真实的伊丽莎白。我们应记得，布朗宁夫人是在40岁出头时起念要写这部诗的，在那个年纪里女人的生活和她的艺术作品的关系总是超乎寻常的密切。因此，即使是最严谨的批评家，在应该专注于作品时也不能不有时涉及作者本人。而且，众所周知，伊丽莎白·巴雷特的那种生活经历必然影响最纯正、最有个性的才能。

她幼年失母；她曾私下里读大量读书；她最亲近的兄弟溺水而死；她曾长期卧病；她那专制的父亲以传统的方式把她囚禁在温波尔街的卧室里。不过，我们最好还是别重复这些熟悉的事实，而是读读她本人怎样描述这些事对她的影响。

我只在内心里生活（她写道），或者，只体验着悲伤这一种强烈的感情。早在疾病造成与世隔离之前，我已经在独自索居。世上很难找出比我更没见过世面、更耳目闭塞的女孩子，而我现在简直算不得年轻了。我在乡下长大——没有什么社交机会，一心迷上了书本和诗歌，在幻想中获得经历。时间就这样不断流逝了——后来我生了病……似乎简直没希望（有一度看来就是如此）再踱出房门。于是，我开始觉得不平……我行将离开这人生的殿堂，却一直被蒙蔽双眼，一无所见——我不曾见识过人性，我在世上的兄弟姐妹们对我来说只是空洞的名字，我没看到过高山和河流，实际上什么也没见过。……你知道无知给我的艺术造成哪些不利吗？莫非你看不出么？如果我活下去而不逃离囚牢，我将在极为不利的条件下劳作——可以说我是一个盲诗人。当然，不利条件能得到某种程度的补偿。由于自我意识和自我分析的习惯，我有丰富的内心生活，我对人类主要的本性做了不少重要的猜想。但是，作为一名诗人，我多么愿意拿若干这种笨重的、沉思的、无效的书本知识去换取一些对生活和人的切实经验，去换取一些……

她中断了，打上了几个删节号，我们可以乘此机会回到《奥罗拉·李》。

布朗宁夫人的实际经历到底给她的诗人生涯带来了多少损害呢？我们不能不承认，伤害很大。当我们翻阅《奥罗拉·李》或《书信集》时，可以明显地看出，两者常常是彼此呼应的。这部节奏急促、混乱无章的诗作描述了真实的男男女女，它所自然地表达的那个心灵并不善于从孤独中得益。一个抒情的、笃学的或精益求精的思想者可能会利用孤独或隐居完善自身的能力。丁尼生所企望的不过是在乡村腹地独自与书本相处。但伊丽莎白·巴雷特的思想是活泼的、入世的、讥讽的。她不是学者。书本对她来说不是目的，而是生活的替代品。她在对开本中驰骋，是因为人们不许她在草地上奔走。她与埃斯库罗斯和柏拉图搏斗，是因为她根本没有可能与活着的男人女人争论政治。她生病时最爱读的是巴尔扎克、乔治·桑，以及别的“不朽的非礼之作”，因为，“它们使我的生活保持了某些色彩”。当她最后打破囚笼之时，最引人注意的是她投身当时生活的那种热情。她喜欢坐在咖啡馆里看行人走过，她喜欢政治、争论和现代世界中的斗争。往昔及其残骸，甚至意大利的往昔及其残骸，都远远不像中庸者休谟先生的理论或法国皇帝拿破仑的政治那样令她感兴趣。意大利绘画和希腊诗歌在她那里引起些迂拙的老一套热情反响，这和她关注实际事物时创造性的独立不羁精神形成奇特的对照。

她的天性既如此，也就不必奇怪，即使深居病室，她的头脑仍选择了现代生活作为诗的题材。她没有动笔，明智地等待着，直到出逃使她获得了某些知识和分寸感。但是毫无疑问，作为艺术家那孤独隐居的漫长岁月对她有不可挽回的损害。她被摈于生活之外，猜想着外界的情况，并且不可避免地夸大了内心的经验。对她来说，小狗弗拉希之死有如女人失去爱子。常春藤碰触玻璃窗的动静变成了树木在狂风中猛烈摇摆的啸声。病室的静寂是那么深沉，温波尔街的生活是那么单调，因此在感受中每个声音都被扩大，每个事件都被夸张。最后，她终于得以“冲进客厅之类的场所，剥去一切伪装，直面这个时代的人性，明白地道出真相”。可她却已太虚弱了，无法承受这一震惊。寻常的阳光、流传的蜚语及日常的人际交往使她精疲力竭、兴奋无比、头晕目眩；她所见如此之多，她所感如此丰富，以致她不再能确知自己到底见到了什么或感受到了什么。

因此诗体小说《奥罗拉·李》虽然本来有潜力，却未能成为一部经典杰作。它是杰作的胚胎，在其中天才起伏漂动，处在某种未出生的状态，等待创造力完成最后的工序使它成形。这部长诗有时激扬，有时沉闷；有时雄辩，有时笨拙；既庞大怪异，又精巧细致；它轮流具备上述特点，令人沉迷，使人困惑。但尽管如此，它仍然唤起我们的兴趣和尊敬。当我们阅读它时，便越来越明白地认识到：不论布朗宁夫人有哪些缺陷，她是敢于在想象生活中英勇无私地探险的少数作家之一。这想象生活和作者的私生活是不相干的，理应与个人品格分开对待。这样她的“心愿”终于没有夭折。她的理论确有兴味，弥补了其实践中的许多缺点。撮要归纳该诗第五卷的阐述，可将这一理论简述如下。诗人的真正的任务，她说，是表现他自己的，而不是查理大帝的时代，较之罗兰(4)和他的骑士们在龙塞斯瓦列斯村，在客厅里有更多的激情发生。“躲避现代的漆饰、上衣和花边／呼唤古罗马的宽袍和如藏的景象／这是致命的，而且愚蠢。”因为活的艺术表现并记录真实生活，而我们所唯一真正了解的就是我们自己的生活。但是，她问道，表现现代生活的诗歌可能采取什么形式呢？戏剧是不可能的，因为时下只有最奴性、最驯顺的剧本才有可能成功。何况，我们（在1846年）想就生活发表的见解已不适合“纸板布景、演员、提词人、汽灯和化妆那一套，而今我们的舞台就是灵魂自身”。那么她能做什么呢？这是个难题，努力定会逊于目标，但她至少把自己生命的血液挤进了每一书页，至于其他——“让我少想些形式和外在的东西。相信精神……保持火种不熄，让那高贵的火焰自己去成形。”于是，火光耀眼，火焰高蹿。

想在诗中探讨现代生活并非巴雷特小姐一人的愿望。罗伯特·布朗宁也说过，这是他一生的抱负。考文垂·帕特摩尔的《家庭天使》和亚瑟夫·克拉夫的《托布纳利奇的小屋》都属于这样的尝试，而且先于《奥罗拉·李》若干年。这很自然。因为小说家们已在散文中十分成功地描写了当代生活。《简·爱》《名利场》《大卫·科波菲尔》和《理查德·菲弗利尔》等纷纷在1847至1860年间接踵而来。诗人们不免会和奥罗拉·李一样觉得现代生活也不失热烈，并具有其自身的意义。为什么这些全都应该成为散文作家的囊中之物呢？当今之世，乡村生活、客厅生活、俱乐部生活和街头生活中的趣事和悲剧都大声疾呼着要求被宣扬，诗人为什么非得被迫去回顾遥远的查理大帝、罗兰骑士、古罗马的袍子和如画的景象呢？不错，诗歌用以表现生活的旧形式——即戏剧——的确是过时了，可是，难道就没有其他的形式能够替代它吗？布朗宁夫人相信诗的神圣，她久久沉思，尽可能地撷取实际经验，最后抛出了她的九卷素体诗，向勃朗特姐妹们和萨克雷们挑战。她以素体诗的形式吟咏肖尔迪奇和肯辛顿(5)；“我姑姑”和教区牧师，罗姆尼·李和卡林顿；玛丽安·厄尔和豪爵爷；奢华的婚礼、暗淡的郊区街道、帽子、胡须、四轮马车和铁路上的火车。“诗人能够写这一切，”她大声宣布说，“就像他们能写骑士、美女、壕沟、吊桥和城堡中的庭院。”不过，他们真的能吗？让我们来看一看，当一个诗人不再写史诗或抒情诗，却侵入小说家的领地偷猎——编写故事，表现在维多利亚女王统治中期被种种利益和激情驱动的、不断消长变化的生活，究竟会出现怎样的情况。

首先的问题是那个要讲述的故事。诗人必须设法告诉我们主人公被邀请赴晚宴等一些必要的情况。对此小说家会尽可能平淡地、不事声张地予以处理，比如：“当我正颇为伤心地吻她的手套时，送来了一张便条，说她的父亲向我致意，并请我第二天去她家用晚餐。”这样的叙述倒也无伤大雅。可诗人却得这样写：

我正亲吻她的手套，不胜悲哀，

仆役送来佳人的一纸短简，

说她爸爸要她代为致意，

并问来日可否共进晚餐！

这简直有点荒唐。平常的字句被用来装腔作势，被着重地读出，使它们显得滑稽可笑。其次，诗人该怎样应付对话呢？布朗宁夫人说过，如今我们的舞台就是心灵。如她所暗示的，在现代生活中唇舌已经取代了刀剑，生活中的精彩时刻、一个人物给其他人物带来的惊愕，都是通过谈吐体现的。但是诗歌在跟踪人们的日常会话时就显得先天不足了。请听罗姆尼在一个非常激动的时刻如何与他的旧情人玛丽谈论她和另外一个男人生的孩子：

愿上帝也如此地养育并离弃我

像我养育他，让他觉得

自己是个快乐的孤儿。我让孩子

分享我的酒杯，睡在我的膝头，

在我的脚畔高声地欢跳

在大庭广众前牵着我的手……

如此，等等。简言之，罗姆尼像所有伊丽莎白时代的主人公们那样狂呼乱跳，而布朗宁夫人原本曾急切地警告，不许这些人进入现代客厅。事实证明素体诗是鲜活口语的无情死敌。日常谈话被抛到起伏摇动的诗句上，变得高亢激扬、咬文嚼字、感情浓烈；而且，因为行动已经被排除，言谈就必须继续下去，于是读者的思想在单调的节奏中陷入僵化迟钝的境地。布朗宁夫人被她诗行的铿锵节奏而非人物的感情所引导，于是高谈阔论，泛泛言说。她所采取的体裁形式的性质迫使她忽略了那些较为轻灵微妙或色彩较为不显著的情感，而小说家正是凭借这些一笔一画地描绘出人物来。变化与发展，一个人物对另一个人物的影响——这些都被放弃了。整部诗变成了冗长的独白，我们所知晓的唯一的人物和故事就是奥罗拉·李本人的性格和经历。

因此，如果布朗宁夫人所设想的诗体小说是要细致入微地展现人物，揭示众多心灵间的关系并不停顿地展开故事，可以说她彻底地失败了。不过，如果她只是想使当时的一般生活，以及那些毫无疑问属于维多利亚时期并力图解决时代问题的人物，经过诗火的烧炼变得更加明亮、强烈、浓缩，让我们对之有所感受，她则实现了自己的意图。奥罗拉·李热切地关心社会问题，渴望知识和自由，因同时身为艺术家和女性而矛盾重重，确为她的时代的女儿。罗姆尼同样毫无疑问是维多利亚中期的绅士，心怀高贵理想，对社会问题殚精竭虑，并很不走运地在希洛普郡建立了一个傅立叶式的共居团体。那位姑姑、那些沙发罩布和奥罗拉逃离的那所乡村宅第都相当真实，简直立刻就能在托特纳姆宫路的交易所卖出大价钱来。诗人准确地抓住了维多利亚时代的人在大的方面的感受并把它们生动地刻印在我们的脑子里，丝毫不逊于特罗洛普和盖斯凯尔夫人的小说。

实际上，如果我们把散文小说和诗体小说加以比较，散文也并不能尽领风骚。有时候，小说家会抖散开分别写的十几个场景，在诗中被压成一个，许多页细致的描绘被融为一行，当你一页页读这样精练的叙述时，不禁会觉得诗人胜过散文作家。诗人的书页比散文容量大一倍。虽然诗中人物有可能是漫画式的剪影或夸张的概括，未能在冲突中徐徐展现，但却包含某种被提高了的、象征性的意义，这是采取渐进手法的散文无法与其竞争的。诗歌具有紧凑性和省略性，它可以借此睥睨散文家及其对细节的缓慢积累；也正因此，事物的总体方面——市场、落日、教堂——在诗中现出辉煌并具有某种连续性。由于这些，《奥罗拉·李》虽有种种缺陷，却仍然存在，呼吸，活着。贝多思或亨利·泰勒爵士的剧作虽然写得漂亮，却如僵尸冰冷静卧，罗伯特·布利吉斯的古典主义剧作如今已极少有人问津。如果我们想到这些，就会觉得，当初伊丽莎白·布朗宁夫人冲进客厅，宣布这个我们生活并工作的场所乃是诗人真正的领地，实在是受到了真正的天才之火的激励。至少，她这种尝试的勇气是有价值的。她的不高明的趣味、她的苦恼不安的独创精神，以及她那挣扎着、滋蔓着的迷惘的激烈意绪，在这里得到了可以发挥的空间，又不至于造成太重大的损害，而她的耿耿赤忱和丰富情怀、她出色的描绘能力和她敏锐尖刻的幽默感，将她本人的热情传染给我们。我们发笑，我们抗议，我们抱怨——这太荒唐了，这不可能，我们一刻也不能再容忍这样的夸张了——但我们仍被深深吸引，一直读到结尾。一个作家还能再要求什么呢？我们对《奥罗拉·李》的最高的赞誉是：我们感到奇怪，为什么没有后继之作跟随而来？街道和客厅肯定是极有前途的题材；现代生活无愧于缪斯女神。不过，伊丽莎白·巴雷特·布朗宁在从病榻上跃起并冲进客厅之际匆匆绘就的速写未能最终完成。诗人或是太保守，或是太胆怯，以致使现代生活仍然主要是小说家的猎物。在乔治五世(6)的时代，我们没有诗体小说。

《鲁滨逊漂流记》


对于这么一部经典作品，是可以从许多不同角度来探讨的。那么，我们究竟选择哪一种角度呢？我们是不是要先说一说：自从锡德尼(1)撇下未完稿的《阿刻迪亚》(2)在札特芬去世以后，英国社会经历了种种变化，而小说则已经选定了——或者说不得不选定了自己的发展方向呢？一个中产阶级已经诞生——他们有阅读能力，急于想读的不光是王子和公主的爱情故事，而且要有关他们自己和他们平凡生活的详情细节的书。散文，经过千百人之手，已经锤炼得足以适应这种需要，能够表现生活中的实际状况，而不仅是缥渺的诗意。这当然是对《鲁滨逊漂流记》的一种探讨方式——从小说发展的角度来看待它；但是，我们立刻又想到另外一种方式——从作者生平历史的角度来看待它。从传记这个极好的出发点，我们可以拿出比从头到尾把书读一遍要多得多的时间来进行探索。首先说，笛福的出生年月就靠不住——谁知道究竟是在1660年或是1661年？再说，他把自己的姓究竟拼写成一个字儿还是两个字儿？而且，他的列祖列宗究竟是些什么人呢？据说，他做过袜子商人；可是，一个袜子商人在十七世纪又算得了什么呢？后来，他成为一个小册子作者，并且受到威廉三世(3)的信任；他的一本小册子又使他受到带枷示众的处罚(4)，还被关进了新门监狱；他先受哈莱(5)雇用，后受戈多尔芬(6)雇用；他还是第一个被人以金钱雇佣的报人；他写了无数的小册子和文章，还写了《摩尔·弗兰德斯》和《鲁滨逊漂流记》；他有一个妻子、六个小孩儿；他身材瘦削，鹰钩鼻子，尖下巴，灰眼睛，嘴边还有一个大大的黑痣。凡是对英国文学稍有涉猎的人，不必经人告诉就知道探索小说发展的来龙去脉，考察小说家们的脸部特征，能够消磨掉多少时光，甚至消磨掉多少人的一生。然而，当我们看了理论再看传记，看了传记再看理论，一种怀疑心情常常油然而生：即使我们确切知道了笛福生在何时，以及他爱过何人，又为了什么；即使我们把英国小说从它在埃及的孕育（据说如此）直到它在巴拉圭旷野上消灭（也许这样）(7)，把它的兴起、发展和衰亡都背得清清楚楚，难道我们阅读《鲁滨逊漂流记》的乐趣就能增加一分、对它的理解就能加深一层吗？

因为，书本身才是永世长存的。在与书的接触之中，不管我们怎样弯弯绕绕、躲躲闪闪、拖拖延延、儿儿戏戏，最后等着我们的还是一场单独的搏斗。在作者与读者之间，必须首先进行一番面对面的交易，然后进一步的买卖才有可能进行；而在这种个人会见当中，如果有人不断提醒，说是笛福曾经卖过袜子，他的头发是棕色的，他还曾经带枷示众等，这就只能使我们分心和感到厌烦。我们的首要任务（这个任务常常是非常艰巨的）在于掌握作者的透视角度。我们必须了解小说家究竟怎样安排他自己的世界，否则，批评家催促我接受的那个世界里的种种花絮、传记家要求我们注意的种种奇遇，都不过是对我们毫无用处的累赘。我们必须亲自攀登到小说家的肩膀上，通过他的眼睛来观看一切，弄清楚他是按照怎样的次序去安排小说家们命里注定要细细观察的那些常见的重大事物：人类和人们；然后，是在他们背后的大自然；以及君临在他们之上，为简便起见可以叫作上帝的那种力量。但是，这么一来，混乱、误解、麻烦，都来了。那些事物看似平常，一旦经小说家以自己独特的方式将它们互相结合起来，它们就会立刻变得光怪陆离，以至于面目全非了。这件事大概是真的：人们虽然唇齿相依般地生活在一起，呼吸着同样的空气，但他们各自观察事物的比例感是大不相同的——在这个人眼里，人是巨大的，树是微小的；而在另一个人眼里，树是巨大的，人只是处在背景中的微不足道的小东西。因此，不管课本里怎么说，生活在同一时代的作家们看待事物的尺度各不一样。譬如说，在司各特(8)笔下，山峰巍然屹立，人物描写比例如之；在奥斯汀书里以茶杯上的玫瑰花与人物的机智对话相配；皮考克(9)却拿出一面哈哈镜俯照天地万物，结果，一只茶杯看上去像维苏威火山(10)，而维苏威火山倒像一只茶杯。然而，司各特、奥斯汀和皮考克都生活在同一个时代，他们所看到的是同一个世界，而且在课本里他们又被写进了同一段文学史里。他们的不同之处就在于各自的透视角度。我们只要牢牢掌握住这一点，这一场搏斗就能以我们的胜利而告终；我们只有对作者有这样亲切的了解，也才能够安心去享受批评家和传记家们如此慷慨地提供给我们的多种多样的乐趣。

但是，在这个节骨眼儿上，争论也就出现了。因为，我们自己有对于世界的看法，这看法又是根据我们自己的经验和偏见自自然然形成的，因此，它又跟我们的自负和爱好等紧紧纠结在一起。所以，一旦有人玩弄花点子把我们内心的平静搅乱，我们不可能不感到损害和侮辱。《无名的裘德》(11)或者普鲁斯特某卷新著一问世，报纸上就登满了抗议。契尔腾南(12)的吉卜斯少校说：假如生活真是像哈代所描绘的那个样子，他明天就要用一颗子弹打进自己的脑袋；汉普斯台德(13)的韦格斯女士声称：普鲁斯特的艺术本领尽管了不起，但是，感谢上帝，现实世界跟一个入了邪的法国人的歪曲描写毕竟毫无共同之处。这位先生和这位女士都想控制住小说家的透视角度，使它能够类似并且强化自己的看法。但是，像哈代或者普鲁斯特这样的大作家可不管私有财产的权利，还是径自走自己的路。他靠着自己额头上的汗水，在一团混沌之中理出一个头绪；他在那里栽上树木，在这里安插了人；他按照自己的心愿，让神的形象有时在远方隐藏，有时在眼前出现。凡属杰作——即那些观点明确、条理清晰的作品，作者无不严格要求我们从他自己的透视角度去看待一切，因此，我们往往要感到痛苦。我们的自负心理受到了损伤，因为我们自己的那一套想法被打乱了；我们感到害怕，因为我们原来的精神支柱被抽掉了；我们还感到厌烦，因为，从一种崭新的概念当中又能得到什么满足和快乐呢？然而，有时候，从愤怒、恐惧和厌烦当中偏偏会有某种稀罕而又持久的乐趣诞生出来。

《鲁滨逊漂流记》可能就是一个恰当的例子。它是一部杰作。而它之所以算是一部杰作，主要就是因为笛福在书中自始至终一直保持着自己的透视比例之感。由于这种缘故，他处处让我们受到挫折和嘲笑。现在，就让我们泛泛地看一看这本书的主题，拿它和我们的先入之见比较一下吧。我们知道，书里说的是一个人在经历了许多风险和奇遇之后，又被孤零零抛到一个荒岛上的故事。单单从这种暗示来看，风险，孤独，荒岛，就足以启发我们看到天尽头的某个遥远的地方，看到日出和日落，看到人在与世隔绝的状态之下独自在那里沉思社会的本质和人们种种奇怪的习惯。开卷之前，我们可能已经把指望它给予的那种乐趣大体勾画出来了。于是，我们开始阅读。但是，在每一页我们都受到了毫不留情的反驳。书里并没有什么日落和日出，没有什么孤独的灵魂。相反，在我们面前只有一个泥土做的大罐子。换句话说，书只告诉我们：时间在1651年9月1曰，主人公叫作鲁滨逊·克鲁苏，他的父亲害着痛风病。显然，我们必须改变态度。因为，在后边的内容里，占支配地位的全是现实、实际、财产。我们必须赶快彻头彻尾地改变我们的大小比例概念；大自然必须收起她那灿烂夺目的华衮，她不过是旱灾和水涝的给予者，人变成了为了维持生存而苦撑苦斗的动物；而上帝则降职为一名小小的地方官，他那坚固、结实的宝座仅仅比地平线高出那么一点点儿。为了寻求关于透视中的这三大基本方位——上帝，人类，大自然——的信息，我们所做出的每次努力，都被冷冰冰的普通常识顶回来了。鲁滨逊想到过上帝：“有时候，我暗自发出疑问：上天为何这样全部毁掉它自己造出的生灵？……但是，某种东西总是立刻驳斥我，不许我再想下去。”上帝并不存在。他又想到大自然，想到了原野里“生长着五彩缤纷的花草，还有许多美丽的树林”，但重要的是林子里聚集了一大群鹦鹉，可以将它们驯养，教它们说话。他还想到过他亲手杀死的那些人。但最重要的是必须把他们埋起来，否则，“他们暴晒在日光之下，很快就会发臭的”。这么一来，死亡也不存在了。什么都不存在，除了那一只泥土做的大罐子。这就是说，到了最后，我们只好放弃我们的先入之见，接受笛福自己想要告诉我们的一切。

让我们回头再念一下小说的开头：“1632年，我生于约克市一个有教养的家庭里。”再没有比这个更平凡、更一本正经的开头了。我们一下子就受到了吸引，认认真真地去细想那有条有理、勤奋刻苦的中产阶级生活的种种好处。我们相信，再没有比生长在英国中产阶级更大的幸运了。高贵人士和贫寒人家都叫人怜悯，因为他们都得在忧虑不安中过日子。只有处在卑贱与高贵之间的中间地位上才最最牢靠；而中产阶级的那些优点——节制、稳健、温和、健康——才是最令人向往的东西。因此，一个中产阶级的子弟，倘若由于交了厄运，竟然傻里傻气地对冒险活动入了迷，那真是令人遗憾的事。主人公就这样平铺直叙地写下去，一点一点地描绘出他自己的画像，使得我们永远难忘——他也从不忘记在我们心上留下抹杀不掉的印记，记住他的精明、谨慎，以及他对于舒适和体面的爱好；后来，不知怎么回事，我们觉得自己也到了海上，遭遇风暴，而且，仔细看去，一切景象竟和鲁滨逊眼中所见的一模一样。浪涛、水手、天空、船只——一切都是通过他那一双精明的、中产阶级的、缺乏想象力的眼睛观察出来的。什么也逃不脱他的眼睛。一切事物都按照鲁滨逊那与生俱来的谨慎、精明、墨守传统、讲求实际的智能所了解的，显露在我们面前。他不可能有什么热情。对于大自然的庄严雄伟，他只有一种天生的轻微厌恶。他甚至怀疑上帝夸大其词。他只顾忙着照顾自身利益，对于在他周围发生的事情顶多看见十分之一。他相信，一切事物都会得到合理解释的——只要他有时间去注意它。看到那一群“身躯庞大的动物”在夜晚泅水包围他的木船，我们比他自己更要惊慌。他只是向它们开了一枪，它们走掉，这就完了——至于它们是不是狮子，他根本就没有看清。这样，我们一次又一次吃惊得张大了嘴。不消多久，不管什么咄咄怪事，我们都信以为真了；而这些奇谈，如果让一个想象力丰富、语言夸张的旅行家讲给我们听，我们倒犹犹豫豫、不敢相信呢。但是，这个顽强的中产阶级人物所谈的每一件事都可以当作实情。他老是在计算他那些木桶，并且采取合理措施保护水源；在细节方面，我们很难发现他会出什么差错。我们真想知道：他是否忘记了他在船上留下的那一大块蜂蜡？不，绝没有忘。不过，他既然做了不少蜡烛，蜂蜡在第三十八页比在第二十三页自然要少去许多。纵然有时候他也留下个把悬而未决的矛盾问题，譬如说，为什么不光野猫那么服服帖帖，就连野山羊也都是那么怯生生的呢？——我们也不会感到不安，因为我们相信：只要他能腾出工夫，他肯定会说出一番理由来，而且还是非常健全的理由呢。但是，一个人在荒岛上完全靠自己赤手空拳来养活自己，这可不是一件好笑的事情。当然，哭叫也无济于事，一个人必须独自经营一切。天上电光闪闪，可能引起他的火药爆炸——这可不是为大自然的壮丽景象而兴高采烈的时候，这时候最迫切的是要为火药找一个安全存放的地方。这样，靠着坚定不移地说出他所看到的真情实况，靠着做一个大艺术家——对这一点要摒弃、对那一点要大胆正视，为的是体现出他最大的长处，即真实感。他终于能够把平凡行为写得尊严高贵，把平凡事物写得美妙动人。翻掘土地、烘烤食物、种植庄稼、建造住所——这些简单工作写得何等庄严；短斧、剪刀、圆木、大斧——这些平凡物件写得何等美好。不受议论干扰，故事以气势宏大的质朴风格向前发展。然而，议论岂能使它更加动人心魄？说实在话，他走的是一条跟心理学家恰恰相反的路子——他所描写的并不是情绪对于精神，而是情绪对于身体的影响。他说他在痛苦的一瞬间两只手都握了起来，紧得能把任何软东西都挤碎，“我的上牙齿咬住下牙齿，紧紧贴在一起，一时竟无法把它们分开”。这种描写给人留下的印象就同心理分析的记录一样深刻。他在这方面的直觉是准确的。“让博学家去解释这些事情，以及其中的道理和现象吧，”他说，“我所能为他们做的只是描写事实。”不过，假如你是笛福，把事实写出来也就够了：因为，这种事实是确凿的事实。笛福在描写事实方面的天才成就，除了那些描写散文大师们以外，简直无人可以企及。他只须稍稍提一下“拂晓时灰蒙蒙的天色”，就把一个起风的黎明景象生动地描绘出来了。许多人的死亡、孤独凄凉之感，只用一句极其平淡的话表达出来：“从此以后，我再也看不到他们的踪影，只见过他们的三顶礼帽、一只便帽、两只不成对的鞋子。”然后，他大声说：“我像一个国王一样单独用餐，陪侍在侧的是我的一群仆役。”——这指的是他的鹦鹉、狗和两只猫。读到这里，我们感到好像整个人类都孤独地待在这座荒岛上——不过，笛福爱给我们的热情泼冷水，他立即告诉我们：这两只猫可不是从船上带下来的。那两只猫早就死了。这两只猫是新来的；而且，由于猫繁殖力旺盛，很快就成为岛上一害，而狗却奇怪——一个崽也不生。

这样，由于笛福再三再四地把那只土罐子摆在最突出的地位，说服了我们去看那些遥远的岛屿和荒凉的人类灵魂的栖息之地。正因为他坚定不移地相信这个罐子真是一只用泥土做的结结实实的罐子，他就使得一切其他因素都服从于他的意图——好像用一根绳子把整个宇宙都串联一气了。因此，当我们把这本书合上的时候，不禁要问一下：既然这只简单粗糙的土罐子所给予我们的启示——只要我们能领会其中的含意——就像人类带着他那全部的庄严雄伟气魄屹立在天空星光灿烂、山峦连绵起伏、海洋波涛滚滚的背景之中，那么，难道还有什么理由说它不能使我们完全感到心满意足呢？

多萝西·奥斯本的《书信集》(1)


对英国文学稍有涉猎的人一定会感觉出来：它有时候处于一个萧条的季节，好像乡下的早春似的，树木光秃秃的，山上一点儿绿意也没有；茫茫大地，稀疏枝条，统统无遮无掩、一览无余。我们不禁思念那众生躁动、万籁并作的六月，那时候，哪怕一片小小的树林里也是生机盎然。你静静地站着，就会听见矮树丛中有些身体灵巧的小动物在那里探头探脑、哼哼唧唧、走来走去，忙着它们的什么活动。在英国文学当中也是这样：我们必须等到16世纪结束、17世纪过了很久，那一派萧条景象才能有所变化，变得充满生机和颤动，我们才能在伟大作品产生的间歇，听到人们说长道短的声音。

毫无疑问，必须先有心理学方面的重大发展和物质享受方面的重大变化——扶手椅、地毯、良好的道路，等等，人们才有可能互相细心观察并且顺利地交流思想。我国往古的文学之所以那么气象宏伟，也许该归功于那时候写作还是一种非比寻常的艺术，只有才华横溢的人才能从事，而且，那也只是为了名气，不是为了赚钱。而后来我们的天才却分别消耗在写传记、写报刊文字，或者写信、写回忆录里了，这恐怕就削弱了它在任何一个写作方面的力量了吧？也许如此。可是，到了某个时代，人才寥落，竟然连会写写信、写写传记的人也没有了。传记和人物形状只剩下干巴巴的几条筋。譬如说，埃德蒙·古斯爵士(2)说：邓恩(3)是个高深莫测的人。但是，这不过是因为——尽管我们已经知道了邓恩对于贝德福夫人的看法——我们关于贝德福夫人对邓恩的看法一无所知罢了。她没有什么朋友，可以对之将她对这位怪客人的印象描写一番；即使她有一个知心好友，她也写不清楚自己为什么觉得邓恩古怪。

如果说，种种条件决定：博斯韦尔(4)或者霍勒斯·沃波尔(5)这样的作家不可能产生在16世纪，那么，这些条件对于妇女的压力就更要沉重得多了。且不说物质上的困难——邓恩在密切姆居住的是只有薄薄四堵墙、孩子们还在里边哭闹的狭小房屋，足可说明伊丽莎白时代居民的住房是何等局促——妇女还受一种思想的约束，即认为写作不适合女性的身份。偶尔也有某位贵妇人写点儿东西印出来，那是因为她地位高，有人巴结她，这才得到默许的。但是，下层妇女要做这种事可就要惹人讨厌了。“这个可怜的女人一定是有点儿疯啦，要不然，怎么会这样可笑，竟敢写书，而且写的还是诗！”——当纽卡斯尔公爵夫人(6)出了一本书的时候，多萝西·奥斯本这样说道。谈到她自己，她又说：“哪怕我两个礼拜睡不着觉，也不至于迷糊到那种程度。”这句话特别能说明问题，因为说话的人是一个非常有文学才能的女人。假如多萝西·奥斯本生在1827年，她可能会写出许多部小说；假如她生在1527年，她可能什么也不会写。然而，她是生在1627年，而在那个时代，对于一个女人来说，写书虽还算是荒谬的事，写封信倒没有什么不体面。这么一来，沉寂就一点儿一点儿给打破了。于是，在英国文学中，我们第一次听到了男人和女人们围炉漫谈的声音。

但是，当时书信一道尚在草创之际，还不能像后来那样自成一种艺术，并且结集成书、供人欣然开卷。那时候，男人女人之间还只能客客气气互称“先生”和“女士”，文字仍然华丽而生硬，作者还不能在尺幅之间自由挥洒、曲尽心意。而书信艺术往往又是一种变相的随笔艺术。虽说如此，一个女人尽可常常写信而不至于让人说她有失女性身份。这种写作可以挤零星时间进行，譬如说，在父亲的病榻旁边，写写停停、停停写写，既不会惹人说长道短，又仿佛是无名氏的作品，还常常可以说写信是为了某种有益的目的。然而，在这数不清的信里（它们之中的大部分自然是遗失了）又蕴藏着何等的观察力和才智！——这种观察力和才智到后来又以颇不相同的形态出现在《爱维琳娜》(7)和《傲慢与偏见》之中。自然，这些不过是一批信件而已，但是，某种自豪在写信当中也是少不了的。多萝西口头上不承认，但她对写信不仅下过工夫，而且还有自己的看法：“……大学者不一定是好作家（我指的是在写信方面，写书他们也许在行）……我想，书信应该像谈话一样轻松自由。”她跟她的一位老伯伯的意见不谋而合——这个老头儿曾经拿起墨水瓶往他的秘书头上扔，因为他不肯简单明了地说“写字”，而说什么“援笔书之于纸”。不过，她也考虑到信里的自由轻松毕竟有种种限度。她说“许多有趣的琐事搅成了一团”，用作谈话之资倒比写在信里更好。这么一来，我们就有了一种文学形式（如果多萝西·奥斯本允许这么称呼的话），它与任何文学形式都截然不同。非常遗憾的是：这种文学形式在今天似乎已经永远消失了。

因为，当多萝西坐在她父亲的床边或者家里的壁炉旁写下一大张又一大张信的时候，她向自己那位唯一的也是眼光挑剔的读者(8)既认真又调皮、既郑重又亲昵地进行着生活的记录——这是无论小说家或历史学家都无法提供的。既然她的人生大事就是向她的爱人随时报告自己家里所发生的一切，她自然要在信里为那个道貌岸然的贾斯丁年·艾香爵士(9)，即她称之为所罗门·贾斯丁年爵士的、已有四个女儿、并在诺桑普顿郡置有一所暗幽幽的大宅子、想娶她为妻的那位自命不凡的鳏夫，留下一幅写照。“主啊！我多么想把他用拉丁文写的那封信弄来让你看一看。”她写道——他在那封信里向牛津的一位朋友把多萝西描述一番，特别夸她“可与为伴，可与交谈”；她勾画了那位害着恐病症的表亲莫勒(10)，一天大清早由于害怕自己得了水肿病而突然惊醒，急忙赶到剑桥去找医生；她还描写自己晚上如何在花园里徘徊，闻到素馨花的香气，然而“一点儿也不觉得高兴”，因为邓普尔没有跟她在一起。她听到了什么闲话，立刻转告她的爱人，供他一笑。譬如说，桑德兰夫人屈尊下嫁给平民斯密斯先生，斯密斯待她像公主似的，而贾斯丁年爵士不以为然，说这给女人开了一个坏头。于是，桑德兰夫人见人就说她嫁给他是出于怜悯。多萝西听了，议论道：“这是我听到过的最可怜的一句话。”这样，我们很快就知道了关于她的亲朋好友的许多事情，并且很想知道还有什么新的故事，好把我们心中业已形成的生动印象加以补充。

对17世纪贝德福郡(11)上流社会的一瞥，正因为它是这样若断若续的，才越发引起我们的兴趣。贾斯丁年爵士和黛安娜夫人，斯密斯先生和他的伯爵夫人——这些人物上了场又下场，我们不知道什么时候甚至还有没有机会再听到他们的消息。尽管散珠无串，这些书信却像一切天生的书信作家的作品那样，有它们独特的连续性，使我们一页一页读下去的时候，能感到在多萝西的心灵深处，在那不断展开的人生壮丽行列之中，也有我们自己的一席之地。因为，她不容争辩地拥有一种天赋才能，那在书信写作之中是比机智、才华以及与大人物的交往都更有价值的：她能自自然然、毫不勉强地保持自己的个性，将一切生活琐事囊括在她自己的个性洋溢之中。这是一种既吸引人又有点儿令人迷惑的性格。我们一句一句读着这些书信，跟她的性格渐渐有了密切接触。不过，与她年龄相称的妇德，她却很少流露。她根本不提针线活和烤面包；她的脾气有点儿懒；她漫不经心地看了一大堆法国传奇小说；她在公共荒地上游逛，听挤奶姑娘唱歌；她在花园里的一条小河边散步，然后“坐了下来，真希望你能和我在一起”。她在别人面前常常默不作声，一个人对着炉火冥想，别人谈起了飞行，才把她惊醒，但她一开口就把她哥哥逗笑了——她问他们刚才谈到飞行究竟说了些什么？因为，她自己也在想：要是她能飞，她就能跟邓普尔在一块儿了。严肃、忧郁是她的天性。她母亲常说，她平时那种神情好像亲戚朋友都死光了似的。她总有一种受无情命运压迫之感，以及万事虚空、努力无益之感。她的母亲和姐姐也都是性格严肃的人——她姐姐也以书信闻名，但喜爱书籍胜过人群；她母亲呢，“像大多数英国妇女一样，算得上精明人”，但她说话爱带刺儿。“我活到这个岁数，总算明白了：把人想得再坏也不可能过分；将来你也会明白的。”——这是多萝西记的她母亲说过的一句话。为了平息她的郁愤之气，多萝西曾经自己跑到埃普索(12)水泉那里，饮下了浸过刀剑的泉水。

天性如此，她的脾气自然倾向于冷嘲，而不是机智。她爱嘲笑她的爱人；对生活中的浮华和俗套，她表示出委婉的嘲弄；以门第骄人，为她所讪笑；摆阔气的老头子，是她挖苦的对象；枯燥无味的说教，引她发笑。她把各个政党都看破了；她把繁文缛节也看破了：她把人情世故、表面文章也都看破了。眼光这样敏锐，可有一点她看不破——她怕人讥笑，躲躲闪闪，简直有点儿病态。姑姑阿姨的干涉，哥哥弟弟的霸道，都使她气恼。“我真想住在树洞里，”她说，“为的是躲开他们。”丈夫当众吻自己的妻子，在她的眼里是“一种最惹人讨厌的坏样子”。别人夸她美、夸她聪明，她不放在心上，正像“别人认为我叫伊利莎也好，叫多拉也好”，她也都不在意。可是，只要有人对她的行为说上一句闲话，她就浑身发抖。所以，当她须在别人面前说明自己为什么爱上了一个穷人并且准备嫁给他的时候，她就手足无措了。“我承认，”她写道，“我这种脾气不允许我把自己的心意吐露出来让人嘲笑。”她可以“满足于生存在与自己地位相同者都能生存的小圈子之中”，但是，别人的讥笑她可受不了。她畏首畏尾，言行不敢越轨，免受世人非议。为了这种弱点，有时候邓普尔还责备她。

信陆陆续续写下去，邓普尔的性格也渐渐跃然纸上了。这也正是多萝西作为书信家的才能的又一个证明。凡是高明的书信作者总会巧妙地吸收对方读信人的性格色彩；因此，读他的信，我们就能想象出收信的是何等样人。当我们从信里听到多萝西争辩、说理的声音的时候，同时也就几乎同样清楚地听见了邓普尔说话的声音。他在很多方面都跟她正好相反。他批驳她的忧郁而更加引起她的忧郁；他反对她的厌恶结婚而更加惹得她为自己的厌恶结婚而声辩。在他们两人当中，邓普尔自然是更坚强、更自信。然而，还有一点别的什么——他有点儿冷酷，有点儿骄傲，这说明她哥哥讨厌他还是有一定道理的。他把邓普尔叫作“从未见过那么妄自尊大、盛气凌人、傲慢无礼、脾气乖拗的一个人”。但是，在多萝西眼里，邓普尔身上的优点却是她那么多求婚者当中谁都不具备的。他不是一个十足的乡下绅士，不是一个摆架子的治安法官，不是一个城市的花花公子——对女人见一个追一个，也不是一个到处漂游的法国“莫屑”(13)；因为，他要是这些东西当中的任何一种，多萝西凭着她对于荒谬可笑事物的敏感，根本就不会跟他来往。对于她来说，他具有别人所缺乏的魅力和同情心；对他，她可以想到哪里就写到哪里；跟他在一起，她心情最舒畅；她爱他；她尊敬他。然而，她突然宣布：她不愿嫁给他。她强烈反对结婚，举出一个又一个失败的例子。她认为：即使双方在婚前了解，那也是有限度的。安妮·布仑特夫人只凭热情行事，结果成为“仆役们和街上小青年的话柄”。那位可爱的伊莎贝拉小姐也是毁在热情上了——嫁给了“那么一个拥有房地产业的畜牲”，长得再美又有什么用啊(14)？她哥哥生气，邓普尔妒忌，她自己又怕人嘲笑，心都要揉碎了，现在她什么也不要，只求能一个人“早日安安静静地找到一个坟墓”。但是，邓普尔竟能克服她的重重顾虑，跨过她哥哥的反抗，这只有归功于他的性格力量了。一跟邓普尔结婚，她就不再写信。书信几乎立刻停止。多萝西所创造出来的那个世界销声匿迹了。这时候，我们才醒悟过来：在她笔下已经形成了那么一个完美生动、人物众多、热闹非凡的世界。在她对邓普尔的热烈感情鼓舞之下，生硬拘谨从她的笔端消失了。她半睡半醒地坐在父亲身旁，抓起一张旧信，翻过背面，轻轻松松写了起来，带着那个时代特有的庄重口气，谈起了黛安娜夫人、艾香爵士这些人，谈起了她的姑姑阿姨、叔叔伯伯——他们怎么来了、怎么走了、说了些什么，以及她觉得他们是否愚蠢、是否可笑、是否可爱、是否非常平凡。不仅如此，在她向邓普尔写到了自己内心的秘密的时候，她还暗示出更深切的关系、更隐秘的情愫，那对于她的生活既引起了烦恼，又带来了安慰；还谈起了她哥哥的专横，她自己的郁郁寡欢；还有晚上在花园里散步，独自坐在河边沉思，以及正盼望信来果然就接到了一封信，心里是多么愉快。所有这一切都发生在我们身边，我们沉浸于这个世界之中，对于其中的暗示和言外之意都能心领神会——然而，刹那之间，这一切全都消失了。她结了婚，她的丈夫是一位年轻有为的外交官。她得根据他的官职升迁而到布鲁塞尔，到海牙(15)，到其他什么地方去。他们生下了七个儿女，七个儿女“几乎全都在摇篮里死去”。数不清的义务、责任都落在这位姑娘身上——她本来是嘲笑排场、客套，喜爱清静，盼望远离尘嚣过着隐退生活，“与君终老于小小茅舍之中”。但是，现在她丈夫在海牙任职，他那官邸里的光彩夺目的碗橱中摆满了金银餐具，而她就做了这里的女主人。她还曾经留驻伦敦，交涉催讨（如果可能的话）她丈夫的薪俸尾数。一天，她的游艇受人枪击，而她——据国王说——表现得比船长还要勇敢。她既是一个最好的大使夫人，也是一个最好的退休官员的妻子。苦恼的事一件接一件降临在他们头上——一个女儿死了；一个儿子，可能是继承了他母亲的那种忧郁症，有一天往靴子里塞了许多石块，跳进了泰晤士河。岁月就这样一年一年地流逝了——非常充实，非常活跃，也非常动荡不安。但是，多萝西一直保持沉默。

后来，有一个古怪的年轻人(16)来到了慕尔庄园(17)，做她丈夫的秘书。这个人性子执拗，举止粗鲁，爱发脾气。但正是从他——斯威夫特的笔下，我们才知道一点儿多萝西晚年的情况。“温和的多萝西，娴静，聪明，了不起”——斯威夫特这样赞扬她。但是，这种光辉只能投给一个幻影了。对于这位默默无语的贵妇人，我们只能感到陌生。我们无法把她跟那位向自己的爱人写信、倾吐肺腑的姑娘联系起来。“娴静，聪明，了不起”——我们最后见她的时候，她已经完全不是这样了。尽管我们非常尊重这位可敬的大使夫人，但是，在某些时刻，我们真想不要什么三国同盟的利益、尼梅根条约的光荣(18)，只希望多萝西能把她没有写出的那些信写出来。

斯威夫特的《致斯苔拉小札》(1)


在一个高度文明的社会里，做人处处要伪装，彬彬有礼也不可少，有时候倘能抛开礼数和俗套，用一种“孩子气的语言”跟一二知己说说话，好像在闷热的房间里吹进一丝微风，倒是很有必要的。性格缄默的人，有权势的人，受人仰慕的人，尤其需要这么一个庇护所。斯威夫特就发现了这一点。这个傲气冲天的人一离开那些吹捧他的大人物、巴结他的俏丽女人，一离开那些阴谋和权术，回到自己家里，就把那一切统统放到一边儿，自己舒舒服服坐在床上，撅起他那平时出语尖刻的嘴唇，说出一连串的小孩儿话，向在爱尔兰海峡彼岸的他那“两个淘气精”(2)、他那“亲爱的小家伙们”、他那“一对调皮鬼”喋喋不休地聊起天儿来。

呣，让我再瞧瞧你们。我的蜡烛快灭了。但是，无论如何，我要开始写了。好吧，你就写吧。不过，普列斯多先生(3)，别这么慢吞吞的。你对MD(4)的信有何高见？快说，开场白就免了吧——喂，我说，你这样常常外出，我倒很高兴的。

斯威夫特给斯苔拉写信，常常带着这么一种漫不经心的口气，字迹也很难辨认，因为“在我看来，如果把字写得清清楚楚，不知怎么回事，总觉得我们不光自己在一起，世上的人也都在看着我们似的，潦潦草草瞎写一气，还能有点儿藏掖……”对此，斯苔拉完全不必有什么忌妒心理。虽然，这时她正在爱尔兰白白消磨着自己的妙龄青春，跟丽贝卡·丁利住在一起——也就是那位戴着一副有铰链的眼镜、吸掉不少巴西烟草、走路拖着长裙子的丁利太太。而且，这两位妇女的生活方式也惹起了闲言碎语，因为斯威夫特一回爱尔兰，她们总和他在一起生活；他离开以后，她们就居住在他的屋子里。因此，尽管斯苔拉和他相见时都有丁利太太在场，她毕竟还是一个既与异性亲密交往而又身份不明的女人。不过，这也是值得的。邮件不断从英国寄来，每张纸上都密密麻麻写满了斯威夫特那难以辨认的小字（对这种笔迹，她能模仿到惟妙惟肖的地步），谈的都是些信口开河的闲话，其中夹杂着几个特指的大写字母，还有一些除了斯苔拉谁也不懂的暗示，一些要由斯苔拉来保守的秘密，以及一些交给斯苔拉去完成的小小任务。还给丁利寄来了烟草，给斯苔拉寄来了绸围裙。不管别人怎么说，这还是非常值得的。

关于这位普列斯多先生，亦即跟那个叫人害怕的“另一个我”迥然不同的人物，世间一无所知。世人只知道斯威夫特又到英国去了，他是代表爱尔兰教会请求新上任的托利党(5)政府恢复它的“初创成果”，为此他过去求过辉格党人，但毫无所获。这一回，事情很快就办成了，因为哈莱和圣约翰(6)非常欢迎他，简直是无法超越的诚恳和热情。即使在那么一个拉小团体、崇尚杰出人物的时代，世人看到这么一种景象也不能不感到震惊：两三年前在咖啡馆里窜来窜去的那个沉默寡言、无人知晓的“狂牧师”，如今竟参与了最机密的国务会议；那个原来身无分文的穷小子，威廉·邓普尔爵士宴请内阁大员时都不许他同席共餐，如今却能吩咐公爵贵族们为他办事，而且，还有那么多人来求他帮忙，结果他的仆人的主要任务竟是想法子把客人拒之门外。阿狄生冒充说自己是来还账的，这才闯进门去。一时之间，斯威夫特成了全能者。没人能收买他为自己效劳，人人都怕他那支笔。他到了宫廷里，“觉得很自豪，因为所有的贵族都来凑近我”。女王想听他讲道；哈莱和圣约翰也提出了请求；但他拒绝了。一天晚上，国务大臣先生发了脾气，斯威夫特把他叫住，警告他说——

不要给我脸子瞧，我可不让人把我当小学生看待……他马上接受了，说我有理……还要请我同他到马香夫人的哥哥家去吃饭，以释前嫌；我不去。我不知道对不对，反正我不去。

他把这一切向斯苔拉信笔写下来，既不觉得高兴，也不觉得有什么了不起。现在，他对人颐指气使，与大人物平起平坐，使高官显贵在他面前低头，对这些事，他或她都无须加以评论。多年以前，在慕尔庄园，她不是就已经认识了他，见过他对威廉·邓普尔爵士发脾气，并且听他谈过自己的抱负和计划吗？她不是比任何人都更了解在他身上好的方面和坏的方面怎样奇妙地交织在一起，更了解他的缺点和怪癖吗？他宴请贵族时，那份儿吝啬叫人生气：把煤块从火里夹出来，付车费一个小铜板也不肯多出；然而，正是靠着在这方面节约，他才能省出钱来暗中进行那些体贴入微的施舍——他送给可怜的帕蒂·罗尔特(7)一块金币，“帮他一把，因为他要到乡下去搭伙”；他把二十个几尼(8)带给生病的青年诗人哈利森(9)，亲自送到他住的小阁楼里。只有她一个人明白：他虽在言语上粗暴无礼，但在行动上却温和慈祥，在表面上愤世嫉俗，在内心里却对人怀着深厚感情，这是她从其他任何人身上都见不到的。他们彼此之间从里到外太熟悉了，包括好的方面和坏的方面、深邃的想法和琐屑的小事；因此，在深夜里那些宝贵的时刻或者在清晨醒来以后，他所要做的第一件事就是把自己一天里的全部经历，包括仁慈厚道的行为和悭吝小气的念头，以及各种情感、野心和失望，就像自言自语似的，毫无造作，毫不隐瞒，都向她一一倾诉出来。

对于他的情意既有了这样的证明，世上别人的都不了解的普列斯多又跟自己有这样亲密的友情，那么斯苔拉也没有什么理由可以忌妒了。实际上发生的事也许倒是相反：当她读着这些写得密密麻麻的信，她仿佛见了他的面，听见他说话的声音，并且能够准确地猜想他在那些上流人士当中所留下的印象，这么一来，她比从前更加深地爱他了。而且，不光是大人物讨他的好、巴结他；好像人人有了难处都来找他。譬如说，那个“年轻的哈利森”——他既有病，又一贫如洗，斯威夫特为他发愁，把他送到骑士桥医院，还给他捎去一百镑钱，可是等他赶到，人已经在一个钟头前死了。“想想吧，这叫我多伤心呀！……我无心和财政大臣一同进餐，哪里的宴会也不参加，天快黑时我才吃一点儿东西。”她还可以想象出十一月那个傍晚出现的奇怪场面：汉密尔顿公爵在海德公园被人杀死，斯威夫特立刻赶到公爵夫人那里，陪她坐着，听着她嚷呀、骂呀、怨天怨地呀，整整闹了两个小时，然后把她的事情统统揽在自己身上，居然没有人对他在丧家的身份提出质疑。他只说了一句：“她把我的灵魂都震动了。”年轻的阿什博南小姐突然去世，他大声叫道：“我憎恨生命，因为我想不到她竟会遭遇这样的横祸。成千上万的坏家伙还在给人类制造烦恼，而像她这样的人倒死了，可见上帝不打算让生命成为一种幸福。”由于他那丰富的感情使他在悲悯中又非常愤怒，他一时性起、暴躁起来，反而攻击那些吊丧的人，包括死者的母亲和姐姐，在她们哭成一团的时候，他跑去把她们拉开，抱怨说：“人总爱装得比实际上更伤心，倒把真正的伤心掩盖了。”

这一切，他都向斯苔拉尽情地倾诉出来，包括：悲哀与愤怒，仁慈与粗暴，以及对普通小人物的亲切的爱。在她面前，他像是父兄——笑她的拼写，为她不注意健康而骂她，对她的重要事务进行指点。他还跟她聊天儿、说闲话。他们之间有的是共同的回忆。他们曾在一起度过了许多幸福的时光。“你还记得不：我常常到你房间里去，在大冷天的早晨把火压灭，嘴里喊着‘呜！呜！呜！’把斯苔拉从椅子里哄出来！”他常惦记着她：他出外散步，想着她是否也在散步；当普赖亚(10)用错了他的一句双关俏皮话的时候，他就想起斯苔拉说的那些双关语多么牛头不对马嘴；他把自己在伦敦过的生活和她在爱尔兰过的日子加以比较，并且说不知什么时候才能聚在一起。假如说，这就是斯苔拉对处在伦敦那些才智之士当中的斯威夫特的影响的话，那么，斯威夫特对冷冷清清与丁利太太困居于爱尔兰一个小村里的斯苔拉的影响可就大得多了。她懂得的那一点儿知识，全是许多年以前，在慕尔庄园，当她还是一个小孩儿、他还是一个年轻人的时候，由他教给她的。在她身上，他的影响处处可见——她的思想，她的感情，她读过的书，她的笔迹，她所结交的朋友，她所拒绝的求婚者，等等。的确，对于她的存在，他要负一半的责任。

但是，他所选定的这位女友可不是一个不识不知的奴隶。她有自己的性格。她能独立思考。她落落寡合。尽管样子斯文，也富于同情心，但议论起什么来嘴上是不留情的；加上说话爱直来直去，性子急，想到什么就说什么，所以又叫人有点儿怕她。不过，有天大的本事，她也只好默默无闻。她那微薄的收入，纤弱的身体，加上暧昧不明的社会地位，使得她的生活方式只能是非常寒微的。聚在她身边的熟人，来找她不过是为了寻求一点儿简单的谈话乐趣，因为这位妇女爱听人家讲，也能理解，自己很少插嘴，但偶尔用她那非常悦耳的声音说出来的总是“在座的人当中所说的最有意思的话”。至于说到别的，首先她不算有学问的人，身体状况也不允许她认真用功。虽然她浏览过不少各种各样的书，而且具有一种精细严格的文学趣味，但她读过的东西并不能牢牢记在心上。年轻的时候，她花钱大手大脚、随意抛撤，后来她冷静下来了，过日子极为俭省。“五只蓝花小碟，五样便宜小菜”便是她的晚餐。她有一双秀气的黑眼睛，一头乌黑的头发，虽说不上漂亮，可也楚楚动人；但她穿衣服很朴素，千方百计省出钱来接济穷人，并且把“世上最最可人心意的礼品”赠给她的朋友们（对于这种靡费，她是无法抗拒的）。在这方面的艺术，斯威夫特不知道谁能和她相比，“尽管这件事就其性质来说，正像人生中许多其他事情那样，是非常微妙的”。此外，她还具有被斯威夫特称之为“节操”的那种纯真性格以及——尽管她身体纤弱——那种“英雄般的个人勇气”：有一次，一个强盗来到她的窗口，她开了一枪就把他身体打穿。这些便是斯威夫特写信时，影响着他的心灵的精神因素——当他看见圣詹姆士公园的树木发了芽，当他听着那些政治家在威斯敏斯特(11)互相争吵，他便怀念起自己在拉雷卡(12)的果树、杨柳和鳟鱼小溪，以及隐现在其间的那一个人(13)。他有一个无人知晓的退身去处——当那些内阁大员们欺骗了他，当他帮助某位朋友发财致富之后自己却两手空空。这时，他总还可以回到爱尔兰，回到斯苔拉那里，而且，想起了这一点，他“一点儿也不会感到战栗”。

但是，斯苔拉绝不是强要别人承认自己应得权利的那种女人。她比任何人都了解：斯威夫特爱权力、爱交游——尽管他时时怀着思乡的柔情，时时对上流社会表示出强烈的憎恨，然而，从根本上来说，他偏爱伦敦的灰尘和喧嚣，远远胜过世上的一切鳟鱼、小溪和樱桃树。更重要的，他不愿受人干涉。如果什么人触犯了他的自由，或者稍稍暗示出对他独立的威胁，那么，不管对方是男是女、是女王或是灶房丫头，他立刻就会像个野蛮人一样向他们进行凶猛的反击。一天，哈莱竟敢向他拿出了一张钞票；韦令女士竟敢向他暗示说：阻挡他们结婚的障碍已经消除了。结果，他们两个人都受到了教训，对那个女人尤其严厉。但是，斯苔拉聪明，她不去招这样的没趣。她学会了忍耐。她学会了慎重。即便是待不待在伦敦、回不回爱尔兰这样的问题，她也给他留着完全的自由。她从来不为自己要求任何东西，而结果呢——她所得到的超过了她的要求。斯威夫特对她这种脾气简直有点儿生气了：

……你的宽宏大量真叫我发火。我知道：你为了普列斯多不在爱尔兰而心里暗中抱怨。你想：他说过的，不出三个月就回来，可他又失了约——总是玩这种鬼把戏。然而，斯苔拉口头上说的却是：她无论如何看不出我怎么可能马上离得开，MD对此完全心满意足，云云。你这个调皮鬼，想用这种办法来治我吗？

事实上，她也正是这样把他留住的。他一次又一次写出了这种带着深情的语言：

再见了，亲爱的小家伙们，最亲爱的人们：除了在MD身边，哪里也没有我的平安和宁静……再见了，亲爱的调皮鬼们，只有写到了或是想起了MD，我才会觉得幸福。……你们就像我的亲人一样，我的每一个铜板，你们都可以随便用——我难过的只是不能为了MD更富裕一点儿！

只有一件事情把这些话带给她的快乐打破了——他每次提到她总是使用复数词，总是“亲爱的小家伙们，最亲爱的人们”；MD是代表着斯苔拉和丁利太太两个人的。斯苔拉从来没有单独和斯威夫特在一起。假如说，这只是为了礼貌；假如说，让丁利太太坐在那里也只是一种礼貌。因为，光是她那一大串钥匙和她那只哈巴狗就够她忙的，他们两个说的话，她一个字也不会听。那么，这种礼貌究竟有什么必要呢？为什么要拿这个重担压住她，损害了她的健康，糟蹋了她的快乐，把彼此可以幸福相处的一对“极好的朋友”活活隔离开呢？这到底为了什么？自然是有原因的——其中的秘密斯苔拉知道，但她没有透露(14)。他们二人只好两地相思。而且，由于他们之间并没有约束的纽带，她自己也不敢向她的朋友提出任何要求，她就只得小小心心地琢磨他信里的话，分析他的行动，以便断定他内心的倾向，及时了解其中最微小的变化。只要他能坦白告诉她哪些人是他在伦敦的“宠儿”，并且炫示自己是脂粉堆里的霸王，要求想巴结他的女人必须自己来求他才成，他教训那些漂亮太太，也让那些太太来逗他玩儿——这都没关系，不会惹起斯苔拉的疑心。让贝克莱太太把他的帽子偷偷拿走，让汉密尔顿公爵夫人向他倾诉她的痛苦好啦——斯苔拉对于女性是厚道的，她可以陪这位太太一块儿笑，陪那位太太一起伤心。

然而，在《小札》里有没有另外一种影响的痕迹——有没有什么更为平等、更为亲密、因而也要危险得多的人物的影子呢？假如有一个跟斯威夫特地位相同的女人，就像斯威夫特最初认识的斯苔拉本人那样的一位姑娘，她也不满足于平凡的生活方式，并像斯苔拉说的，渴望明白是非道理，而且同样有才能、聪明，只是没有受过教育——如果有这么一个姑娘存在的话，那倒的的确确是一个可怕的对手哩。但是，究竟有没有这么一个对手呢？要是真有的话，很明显，《小札》里也是不会提的。相反，信里会出现一次又一次的犹豫和辩解，偶尔还流露出不安和窘迫；有时候，通信正无拘无束、有声有色地进行着，突然一下子中断了，仿佛斯威夫特有了什么说不出口的事情。实际上，他去到英国刚刚一两个月，就有一段时间音信杳然。斯苔拉起了疑心，写信去问：有没有什么人住在他那一带，他常常到人家那里搭伙呀？“我不认识这样的人，”斯威夫特回信说，“我也不跟什么人一起搭伙。嗳，离开你以来，我每天跟谁在一起吃饭，你比我还清楚嘛。你这话是什么意思呀，小家伙？”其实，他明白她的意思——她的意思指的是现在跟他住在一起的范纽默利太太，指的是她的女儿埃丝特。从此以后，“范家母女”就一次又一次地出现在《小札》里。因为，斯威夫特自尊心太强了，他不想隐瞒，他承认他常见到她们，但是十有八九他总要想法找出理由来辩解。如果他住在萨福克街(15)，而范纽默利一家住在圣詹姆士街，那么，这正好省得他多跑一段路。后来，他搬到了彻西区，而她们还住在伦敦，那么，把他最值钱的长袍和假发寄放在她们那里正好方便。有时候天热，有时候下雨，他只好在那里待一待。有一回，他们在那里打牌，年轻的阿什博南小姐也在座，他觉得她非常像斯苔拉，因此就多待了一会儿，帮她把牌打完。有时候，他待在那里，是因为懒得动；又一回，他待在那里，是因为忙得不可开交，而她们又是一些不拘礼节的普通百姓。但是，只要斯苔拉稍稍暗示一下，说范纽默利母女是无足轻重的小人物，他就反驳说：“嗳，她们交往的都是有教养的妇女，就像我交往的男人……今天下午，我还看见两位贝蒂小姐在她们那里。”一句话，要把事情的全部真相都说出来，像往日那样脑子里想到什么就写什么，已经不是那么容易了。

他的处境也真是为难。斯威夫特本来比谁都憎恨虚伪、热爱真诚。然而，在这时候，他也不得不躲躲闪闪、掩掩藏藏、支支吾吾了。另外，对他来说，非常需要一个“小窝”，或者说私室，让他可以躲进去缓一口气、轻松一下，做普列斯多先生，而把“另一个我”且放一边。斯苔拉满足了这种任何人也无法满足的需要。但是，在这时候，斯苔拉远在爱尔兰，而范尼萨却近在眼前。她更年轻、更活泼，而且也自有其妩媚动人之处。她同样可以通过教育、开导、责骂，学得成熟起来，像斯苔拉过去那样。而且，斯威夫特对她的调教，也都是为了她好。那么，有斯苔拉在爱尔兰，有范尼萨在伦敦，为什么不能既享有她们各自给予他的友好之乐，又给她们两人都带来好处，同时又不给任一方造成严重损害呢？看来，这是有可能的。无论如何，他允许自己试验一下。反正，斯苔拉在多年之间一直都是安于自己的命运——她从来没有抱怨过。

但是，范尼萨不是斯苔拉。她年轻，性子暴，欠缺修养，不够明智，身边也没有一个丁利太太管住她。她既没有往日的回忆可以重温，也没有“小札”天天寄来安慰她。她爱斯威夫特。她不懂为什么不可以把这种感情吐露出来。难道他自己不是教导她说“凡是正当的事，尽管去做，不必理会世人说长道短”吗？于是，当她受到某种障碍的阻挡，当某种秘密横隔在他们两人之间的时候，她很不明智地向他提出了质问：“请问，见见一个不幸的姑娘，给她提一点儿忠告，究竟有何不可？我想象不出来。”她又愤愤然写道：“你曾经教我要明辨一切，然后你就撇下我在这里痛苦。”最后，在极端苦恼和迷惑不解之中，她鲁莽地出面逼迫斯苔拉亮牌。她给她写信，要求她一定要说出真相——斯苔拉跟斯威夫特到底是什么关系？然而，让她明白了真相的却是斯威夫特。当他那明亮的蓝眼睛放出威严、用强烈的光芒向她一扫，当他把她的信扔在桌上，瞪着她，然后，一言不发、上马而去的时候，她的小命也就完了(16)。当她说“他那杀死人的、杀死人的语言”对她来说比拷问台还要厉害，当她说“你那眼神中有一种那么可怕的东西，它一下子就镇得我闭口无言”，她的话绝不仅仅是形象的比喻。这次见面后，过了两三个礼拜，她就死了。她从人间消失，化为一个不安的幽灵，不断出没在斯苔拉那忧患重重的生活背景之中，使之除了冷清凄凉以外还充满了恐惧。

现在，只剩下斯苔拉一人独享这亲密的友谊。她活着，继续实行那些可怜的计谋，把她的好友留在自己身旁。后来，由于长期苦撑苦熬、掖掖藏藏，由于丁利太太和她的哈巴狗，由于无穷的担心和挫折，她的心力耗干了，她也去世了(17)。当人们将她下葬的时候，斯威夫特远远离开了墓地的灯火，坐在一间密室里，为“我，或者说任何人，蒙上天之赐有幸得到的这位最忠实、最善良、最宝贵的好友”，写出一篇懿行记略(18)。许多年过去，他的精神病犯了，发作时一阵阵的狂怒。然后，他又渐渐变得沉默下来。一天，有人发觉他一个人在那里喃喃自语。“我就是我”——他们听见他这样说。

现代小说(1)


对于现代小说，随便进行一点不严格的考察，很难不理所当然地认为：这种艺术在现代的实践比起往昔总算有所进步。使用它们那简单的工具、原始的素材，菲尔丁(2)可以说写得不坏，奥斯汀(3)写得更好些。可是，把他们的机会和我们的机会比比看吧！他们的杰作确实具有一种奇妙的质朴气息。然而，要拿文学与（举例来说）汽车制造方法相比，就经不起细细推敲了。两个世纪以来，关于机器制造，我们学会了不少东西，但是，关于文学创作我们究竟学会了什么，就大可怀疑。我们并没有学会写得好一些，值得一提的仅仅是我们有时向这个方向、有时向那个方向挪动一下，可是，若从一个高峰顶上看下去，那整个行程的轨迹却具有一种循环的趋势。不用说，我们还无权要求哪怕暂时地占据那样优越的地位。我们只能站在平地上，夹在人群之中，眼睛为尘土迷离，以羡慕的心情回顾那些幸运的勇士——他们已在战斗中获胜，带着功成业就之后的安详神气，因此，我们不禁窃窃私语：战斗，对于他们来说，并不像我们这样激烈。这事还要让文学史家来定夺，只有他们才能说出我们现在究竟是在开创，或是结束，或是正处于一个散文体小说的伟大时代——因为，下面原野里的情景是难以分辨的。我们只知道：激动着我们的既有感念之心，也有敌对之意；某些道路似乎通向肥沃的土地，另一些道路又似乎通向尘沙弥漫的荒野。对此，也许值得尝试着去阐述一番。

对于古典作家，我们并无怨言。如果说我们跟威尔斯先生、本涅特先生和高尔斯华绥先生(4)有什么争执的话，那在一定程度上不过是因为他们三位都还健在，他们作品中那种每日每时仍然活生生存在的缺陷，迫使我们只好不客气地说出自己要说的话。同时要说的是：对于他们的千百种才能，尽管我们也要感谢，但是，我们无条件的感激只能留给哈代先生，留给康拉德(5)先生，并且在小得多的程度上留给《紫红色的土地》《绿色大厦》和《远方与往昔》的作者赫德森先生(6)。威尔斯先生、本涅特先生和高尔斯华绥先生在我们心中唤起了许许多多的希望，然后又不断地使得它们一一落空，所以，我们对他们采取的感激方式主要地只能是感谢他们向我们显示了他们所可能做到而并未做到的一切，以及我们自己实在做不到也实在不想做的事情。面对着一大堆卷帙浩繁、品类众多、既有可赞美之处又有毫不值得赞美之处的著作，我们很难找出一种说法表达出自己想要对它提出的指责和不满。如果我们尝试着拿一个字眼儿把我们的意思概括出来，那就只好说这三位作家都是物质主义者。他们正是因为只关心肉体而不关心灵魂才使得我们失望，并且使得我们感到：英国小说要是早一点（尽可能有礼貌地）摆脱他们而前进，哪怕一下子走入了沙漠，那对它的灵魂倒是要好一些。自然，一个字眼儿很难打中三个不同的目标。对于威尔斯先生来说，它明显地离目标太远。然而，即使说到了他，他也可以向我们暗示在他那天才之中所混入的杂质，以及跟他那纯净的灵感掺合在一起的那一大团泥块。但是，本涅特先生恐怕要算是难辞其咎的被告了，因为他是他们三位当中最能干的艺匠。他能把一本书弄得结构严密、技巧上无懈可击，就连那些最严格的批评家也看不出哪一个漏洞、哪一个缝隙能引起朽坏。因为，在窗框间不透一丝风，在板壁上也没有一条裂口。然而——倘若生命无法在那里面存在，又有什么办法呢？也许，对于《老妇人的故事》、乔治·肯南、艾德文·克雷亨格等许多人物的创造者(7)来说，这种危险大概已经排除了吧？因为，他笔下的那些人物都过着富裕的，甚至出人意料的生活。但是，仍然还得问一下：他们到底是怎样生活的，又是为了什么而生活的？在我们眼里只看到他们频频抛弃了在五镇(8)的精巧别墅，进入某个设有软垫子的头等车厢里，在数不清的电铃和按钮当中消磨时光，而他们这种豪华旅行的最后归宿毫无疑问的是要在布莱顿(9)的高级旅馆里长享清福。对于威尔斯先生，不能说他是这么一种意义上的物质主义者，即：他过分讲究自己作品结构的完整性。他那宽厚的心里装满了种种的、过多的同情，不容许他拿出时间把作品弄得井井有条、内容充实。他之所以成为一个物质主义者，完全是因为他好心好意地把本该由政府官员履行的职务也揽到自己的肩膀上，因此陷在一大堆概念和论据里，简直没有余暇去过问——或者忘记了需要重视——他书里的那些人物写得多么生硬粗糙。然而，对于他写的人间和天堂，还能有什么比这个更厉害的批评吗——就是说：不管今生、来世，只有他笔下的琼恩、彼得(10)那些人物才能在那里居住！他们这位慷慨大方的创造者无论为他们设计出什么样的制度和理想，难道不都是被他们那种低劣的天性弄得一片晦暗吗？此外，对于高尔斯华绥先生那正直、慈祥的性格，我们虽然深深怀着敬意，从他的书里我们同样找不到我们想要寻找的东西。

如果我们给他们这些作品贴上一个“物质主义者”的标签，那意思是说：他们所写的只是些无足轻重的东西，他们拿出了巨大的技巧、巨大的勤奋，只是为了把那些琐屑平凡、转瞬即逝的东西写得仿佛是真实而有长远意义似的。

我们必须承认我们是在苛求，而且还得承认我们很难说清我们所苛求的到底是什么，以证明我们的不满有理。因为我们在不同的时候想到的问题也不同。但是，当我们叹一口气，放下读完的小说，一个念头老是不断出现——这个值得写吗？它究竟有什么意义呢？难道只是因为人类精神时时会犯的一次小小失误，本涅特先生用他这种规模宏伟的装备来捕捉生活，才发生了一点偏差吗？结果，生活逃掉了，而失去了生活，其他一切也就失去了价值。采用这种说法，等于自认观念模糊；但是，即使像批评家那样，使用“现实”这个字眼儿，也无济于事。现在，姑且承认观念模糊（这是一切小说评论都会遇到的难题），让我们还是把自己的看法大胆提出来吧：对于我们来说，目前大为流行的小说形式往往是漏掉了而不是抓住了我们所要寻求的东西。对于这个基本要素，不管我们把它叫作生命或者精神、真理或者现实，反正它离开了，走掉了，它不愿再被我们塞进这么一套挺不合身的外衣里。然而，我们还是坚持一个劲儿地按照那种距离自己内心的物像愈来愈远地设计方案，去构思自己的32章小说。费去如此大量的工夫来证明小说情节真实、酷似生活，不仅仅是浪费了工夫，而且是把工夫用错了地方，倒把意象的光辉弄模糊了、掩盖了。作家仿佛不是出自本愿，而是受制于某个威力强大、蛮不讲理的暴君——这个暴君把他置于自己的奴役之下，为他提供了情节，提供了喜剧性、悲剧性、爱情事件，还提供了一种貌似真实的气氛，把全部小说润色得无懈可击，结果，假如他笔下那些人物真能一下子活了，他们也会发现自己全身穿戴整齐，就连外套上的扣子都是合乎时髦的。暴君的意旨实现了，小说写得恰如其分。但是，随着时间流逝，我们看着这些按照习惯的方式填写得满满的书页，常常感到一阵阵怀疑，一阵阵反感：难道生活真是这个样子吗？难道小说一定要像这样写吗？

向深处看去，生活绝不是“这个样子”。细察一个平常人的头脑在平常日子里一瞬间的状况吧。在那一瞬间，头脑接受着数不清的印象——有的琐细，有的离奇，有的飘逸，有的则像利刃刻下似的那样明晰。它们像是由成千上万颗微粒所构成的不断的骤雨，从四面八方袭来；落下时，它们便形成礼拜一或者礼拜二那天的生活，着重点与往日不同，紧要的关键在此而不在彼。因此，如果作家是一个自由人而不是一个奴隶，如果他能够以自己的亲身感受而不是以传统章法作为自己作品的基础，那么，就不必非有什么情节、喜剧性、悲剧性、爱情事件以及符合公认格式的灾难性结局不可，而一个扣子也不必非要按照邦德大街(11)上裁缝所习惯的方式钉在衣服上。生活并不是一连串对称排列的马车灯，生活是一轮光圈，一只半透明的外壳，我们的意识自始至终被它包围着。对于这种多变的、陌生的、难以界说的内在精神，无论它表现得多么脱离常规、错综复杂，总要尽可能不夹杂任何外来异物，将它表现出来——这岂不正是一位小说家的任务吗？我们不仅要为文学中的勇气和真诚而申辩，我们也要明白提出：小说的恰当素材是跟习惯要求我们相信的那种东西稍有不同的。

至少，我们想以这种方式来说明几位青年作家的作品——在他们当中，詹姆斯·乔伊斯先生(12)是最著名的——跟前人比较起来究竟有什么不同之处。他们尝试着更贴近生活，把那些使他们发生兴趣、受到感动的东西更真实、更确切地保存下来，即使为了做到这一点，小说家通常要遵守的那些传统章法大部分就得丢掉。让我们按照那些微粒落下的顺序，把它们在我们头脑中留下的印象记录下来；让我们把每种情景、每个事件在我们意识中留下的图像，不管表面看来多么支离破碎、互不连贯，都描绘下来。我们不可以想当然，认为生命在通常所谓的大事中比在通常所谓的小事中能够更完满地存在。任何人，读了《青年艺术家的画像》，或者读了目前正在《小评论》(13)上发表的那部可能远远更有趣味的作品《尤利西斯》，关于乔伊斯先生的意图，大概都会大胆提出某种这一类的理论。我们根据这么一份未完稿而立论，自然有点儿冒险，没有把握；不过，无论全书的意图如何，有一点毫无疑问：作者的意图是极端真诚的，而作品呢，尽管我们可能觉得它难懂、读起来不愉快，它那重要的影响也是不可否认的。跟我们称为物质主义者的那些作家们截然不同，乔伊斯先生是偏重精神的：他不惜一切地关心着的，是要展示心灵深处的那一团火焰如何通过头脑明灭不定地闪现出它的种种信息，并且，为了使它存留下来，他以十足的勇气，撇开他所认为的一切外来因素，不管那是可能性、连贯性，或者别的什么。而世世代代中，每当读者该去想象那些既摸不着又看不见的内容时，这些因素就成为指引他想象力的路标。例如，在公墓那一个场景，鲜明的色彩、恶浊的气氛、松散的结构、电光石火倏然一闪的重大含意，使人心里悚然有所感悟，至少在第一次阅读时很难不称赞这是一部杰作。如果我们要的是生活，这就是生活的本来面目。当然，如果我们还想说点儿别的什么，说一说这样一部具有独创性的作品究竟为什么比不过《青春》或者《卡斯特桥市长》(14)（因为，既然比较就要跟高明之作相比），这时候，我们就觉得苦于找不到合适的话。它被比下去，因为这个作家思想比较贫乏——我们可以这么简单说一句，就算完事。但是，还不妨进一步追问一下：我们之所以感到自己好像处于一所明亮而狭小的房间，只觉得狭窄而闭塞，不觉得宽敞而自由，是不是不仅因为思想，也因为方法所造成的某种限制？是不是方法约束了创造力？是不是由于方法所限，我们才既不感到愉快，也不感到开阔，只是全神贯注于自我本身，而自我本身，尽管由于感觉敏锐而战栗，却从来不去领会和表现在本身之外和远处的东西？也许，出于劝善的目的，把重点放在粗鄙下流的事情上，这才产生了棱角分明、与众不同的效果吧？也许，这不过表明：任何一部戛戛独造的作品，在当代人眼里，特别容易看出它的不足之处，而难于看出它所做出的贡献吧？无论如何，只站在圈子外边检查“方法”是不行的。假如我们是作家，任何方法都是对的，一切方法都是对的，只要它能表达出我们想要表达的东西；假如我们是读者，任何方法都是对的，一切方法都是对的，只要它能使我们更密切地了解小说家的意图。现在这种方法好就好在能使我们更密切地了解我们打算称之为“生活”的东西。难道阅读《尤利西斯》不曾向我们提示：生活中有多少东西被小说排斥在外、弃之不顾吗？难道一打开《项狄传》(15)，甚至《潘登尼斯》(16)，不就使我们悚然一惊，并悟出在生活中还存在着其他许许多多的方面，而且还是更为重要的方面吗？

既然如此，目前摆在小说家面前的问题，正如我们揣测往昔的情况那样，在于想出办法——能得心应手地把自己要写的东西写出来。他得拿出勇气来，说现在他感兴趣的已经不是“这个”，而是“那个”——他只有用“那个”来构思自己的作品。对于现代人来说，“那个”——兴趣的中心——很可能就存在于心里的隐蔽之处。这么一来，着重点一下子转移了，移到了一向为人忽视的某种东西上面来了；于是，不但我们的前辈莫名其妙，我们自己也难以理解的某种迥然不同的形式就应运而生了。也许，只有一个现代人，或者说只有一个俄国人，体会到了像契诃夫写进他那篇叫作《古谢夫》的小说里的情境的趣味。几个俄国兵被遣送回国、病卧在船上。我们读到了他们一些谈话片断、一些思想活动。然后，有一个兵死了，被抬走了。别的兵继续说了一阵话。最后，古谢夫也死了，样子“像一根红萝卜或者白萝卜”，给丢进海里。小说的重点放在那么一些叫人意料不到的地方，乍一看来好像根本没有什么重点。然而，当我们的眼睛习惯于幽幽的微光，把房间里件件东西的轮廓一一认清之后，这才看出来这篇小说写得多么圆满周到、多么深刻，而契诃夫又是多么忠实于自己的视觉印象，他挑选出这一点、那一点、另外一点细节，将它们排列在一起，于是就构成了崭新的内容。但是，我们无法说“这一点是喜剧性的”、“那一点是悲剧性的”；而且，由于我们一直被人教导说，短篇小说应该写得简练而带结论，但这一篇却写得含含糊糊又不带结论，所以，我们也说不清它到底算不算短篇小说。

要对现代英国小说哪怕进行最初步的评论，也不免要提一下俄国人的影响，而只要一提俄国人，我们就不能不感觉到：写文章谈小说，要不谈他们的作品，简直是浪费时间。不从他们那里，我们又从什么地方去寻找对于心灵那样深刻的了解？当我们对我们自己的物质主义感到腻烦的时候，他们——哪怕最不起眼的小说家——却对人的精神生来就怀有一种天然的崇敬。“要学会和人们亲近。……但是，不要让这种同情仅仅出自理智——因为出自理智的同情是容易的——而要发自内心，发自对于人们的爱。”(17)在每一个伟大的俄国作家身上，我们都仿佛看到了圣徒的特征——如果对于他人苦难的同情，对于他人的爱，以及为了达到某种要对人的精神进行严酷考验的目标而奋斗，即构成为圣徒性格的话，那么正是他们的这种圣徒精神使我们感到惶惑，觉得我们自己由于缺乏信仰而浅薄无聊，因而使得我们的许多著名小说看起来华而不实。俄国人的心既然如此博大而充满悲悯，他们所得出的结论也就不可避免地包含着极大的悲哀。再确切一点说，我们可以把这个叫作俄国人思想的无结论性。这指的是那么一种人生无答案之感，就是说，认真考察起来，人生只是提出了一个又一个问题，小说在无法解决的疑问中结束了，我们心里充满了一种深深的——到最后又可能变成一种怨恨的——绝望；而那些问题仍然遗留下来，有待继续探索。他们大概是对的。毫无疑问，他们没有我们这样严重的视力障碍，比我们看得要远。但是，我们说不定也看出了他们没有看到的什么东西，要不然，他们抗议的声音怎么会跟我们的愁闷情绪结合在一起呢？这种抗议的声音乃是另一种古老文明的声音。看来，它在我们身上所培养出的是享乐和战斗的天性，而不是受难和理解的天性。从斯泰恩到梅瑞狄斯(18)的英国小说证明了我们对于幽默和喜剧、对于大地的美丽、对于才智的活动、对于人体的光辉所具有的天然爱好。但是，我们从这样大大悬殊的两国小说比较之中所得出的任何推论都是于事无补的，除非这些推论能使我们充分看到小说艺术的广阔可能性，并且提醒我们它的前景无限，无论什么“方法”，什么试验，都不会受到禁止——除了虚伪和矫饰。“小说的恰当素材”是不存在的；一切事物、一切感情、一切思想都是小说的恰当素材；头脑和心灵的一切特点都值得吸取；一切知觉印象都有用处。我们可以想象：假如小说艺术重新生气勃勃地回到我们当中，她一定愿意让我们不仅尊重她、热爱她，而且训练她、驯服她。因为，只有这样，她才能恢复她的青春，保证她的权威。

保护人和番红花(1)


刚刚从事写作的男女青年常常听到这么一种仿佛有道理、其实完全行不通的劝告：写东西要尽量简短、明白，写时别的什么都不必考虑，只要把心里想的准确地讲出来就行了。当此之际，谁也不提另一件不可少的事情：“一定要选好自己的保护人。”——而这个才是全部问题的关键。因为，一本书写出来，总是为了让什么人读的，而既然保护人并不光指发钱的会计，还以一种非常微妙而隐晦的方式指某种作品的唆使者和授意者，那么，找出这么一个理想的人选就是至关重要的事了。

但是，究竟谁才是理想的人选，谁才能够引诱作家的头脑构思他那最佳杰作，促使他那孕育之中的种种充满生机的作品诞生出来呢？对于这个问题，不同时代有不同的答案。大致说来，伊丽莎白时代的作家选择贵族和剧场观众作为自己写作的对象。18世纪的文学保护人是由咖啡馆的才子和格拉布街(2)的书商这两种人组成的。在19世纪，大作家都为那些半克朗(3)一本的杂志和有闲阶级写作。当我们回顾这些不同的联盟并赞赏它们所产生的辉煌成果时，我们觉得这一切要跟我们的尴尬处境比起来，真是单纯得令人羡慕，像大白天一样清楚——可我们自己又该为谁而写作呢？因为，今天站在我们面前的保护人是空前的品类繁多、叫人糊涂：有日报、周报、月刊；有英国的读者和美国的读者；有畅销书读者和滞销书读者；有文化修养高的读者和追求紧张情节的读者——他们现在全都组成了具有强烈自我意识的实体，通过各自的喉舌宣布了他们的不同需要，把他们赞成什么、不满什么全都告诉大家。譬如说，一位作家看见肯辛顿公园(4)里番红花初次开放，受到了感动，在他动笔写文章之前，先得从一大批竞争的刊物当中选出某一个对他最合适的主顾。“对他们统统不必考虑，只想着你的番红花好了。”——这么说是不济事的，因为写作是一种交流方式，你的番红花只有在与他人共同欣赏中才算一朵完整的番红花。迟早也许会有人专为他自己一个人写作，不过那只是例外，而且还是一种不值得羡慕的例外，如果有哪些傻瓜愿意读他那些作品，就让傻瓜们读去吧。

即使每一个作家不是为这一些读者就是为那一些读者而写作，心高气傲的人仍会说读者应该是柔顺的，无论作家高兴写什么，他们都只能恭恭敬敬地接受。这种论调仿佛有理，却会带来很大的危险。因为，那么一来，作家虽意识到了自己的读者，可又超越在读者之上——这却是一种既不舒服又很不幸的结合，塞缪尔·巴特勒、乔治·梅瑞狄斯和亨利·詹姆斯(5)的作品都可以拿来作为证明。他们每个人都看不起读者；每个人又希望有一批读者；而每个人又没有赢得自己的读者；然后，他们每个人再将自己的这种失败转嫁给读者承担，作品写得愈来愈生硬、晦涩、矫揉造作，而凡与自己的保护人友好、平等相处的作家绝不会想到要那么做的。结果，他们的番红花就变成了扭曲的花朵，虽然鲜艳明丽，看上去却像歪着脖子，有点儿畸形，这一边枯萎，那一边开得过盛。少许一点儿阳光对他们会大有好处的。那么，我们是不是就得走到另一个极端——哪怕在想象中——接受《泰晤士报》和《每日新闻报》假定向我们提出的那种讨好的建议：“奉上现金20镑，预付阁下关于番红花之大作，文计1500字，该番红花带有作者署名，应于明日上午9点在英国从约翰·格鲁特到地角(6)每家早餐桌上准时出现？”

但是，一朵番红花够吗？它大概必须带着一种金灿灿的颜色，能够闪耀到很远的地方，非常值钱，而且带有作者的署名吧？报纸，无疑是能够繁殖番红花的一部大机器。但是，如果我们察看一下这些番红花，就会发现它们远非每年3月初在肯辛顿公园里从草丛中绽开的那些小小的黄花或紫花。报纸上的番红花自有它的动人之处，但它是另外的一种植物。它能恰好填满给它指定的那一部分篇幅。它能放射出金色的光辉。它亲切、友好、热情。它也精致完美——不要以为《泰晤士报》的“本报戏剧评论员”或者《每日新闻报》的林德先生(7)的艺术技巧是轻易得来的。能在上午9点钟使100万人的头脑都活跃起来，使200万只眼睛都有一些鲜明、生动、有趣的东西可看，这种本领可不能小看。但是，夜晚一来临，这些花朵就统统凋谢了。这些小玻璃片儿，一旦拿出了海水，立刻失去了它们的光芒；大名鼎鼎的女歌手，如果被关进了电话间，就会像海乙那(8)似的号叫；才气横溢的文章，一旦挪离了自己的活动范围，就会变成尘土、沙砾和草皮。报刊文字，倘若收集成书，往往不值一读。

这么说来，我们所需要的保护人就是能够帮助我们、使我们的艺术花朵永不凋谢的人。但是，由于时代不同，文学保护人的素质也起着变化，而我们处在这竞争的人群中，必须有自己的坚定信念，不为种种假象所迷惑，不受种种派别所蒙蔽，因此，寻找保护人这件事就构成了文笔生涯中的一种考验和磨炼。懂得了为什么人而写作，才懂得如何去写作。现代的文学保护人的一些素质又是相当清楚的。显然，此时此刻，作家所需要的不是爱看戏的保护人，而是爱看书的保护人。现在，保护人还得接受过关于其他时代和其他民族文学的教育。此外，由于当代文学所特有的癖好和倾向，还要求他具有另外一些素质。譬如说，存在着一个猥亵描写的问题——它骚扰着我们，使我们感到困窘，比伊丽莎白时代更甚。20世纪的文学保护人对此不应感到震惊。他必须准确无误地分辨出哪些是出于必要而黏在番红花上面的小小粪土块，哪些是为了虚张声势有意涂抹在番红花上面的污秽。他还必须判断出那些不可避免地要在现代文学中发生重大作用的社会影响，并且能够说出哪些起着完善和加强的作用，哪些起着抑制和削弱的作用。此外，感情问题也需要保护人来表态；在这个领域里他能起到非常有益的作用——他可以支持作家一方面下决心避免多愁善感，另一方面克服那种不敢表达自己感情的怯懦恐惧感。他会说：害怕自己的感情要比感情太盛更糟糕，也更常见。保护人也许还会谈到语言问题，指出莎士比亚曾经使用过何等丰富的词汇，莎士比亚又曾违反过多少语法规定，而我们呢，尽管在写作时像弹钢琴一样拘谨地用手指按着黑键，可比起《安东尼与克娄巴特拉》(9)也看不出好到哪里去。假如你能完全忘记自己的性别（他还会说），那敢情好，一个作家是没有性别的。但是，顺便说一句：这一切只是基本概念，而且还是有争议的。保护人的首要素质是另外一种东西，那也许只能用一个可以包容一切的字眼儿来表达——气氛。非常必要的是：保护人应该将番红花掩护和笼罩在那么一种气氛之中，使它看来像是一种极其珍贵的花朵；如果把它歪曲描述，简直就是人生在世所犯的一种不可饶恕的罪行。他必须使我们体会到：仅仅一朵番红花，只要是真正的番红花，对他来说也就足够了；他不想听人教训、提高认识、接受指导、有所改进；他过去曾经逼迫得卡莱尔大声怒吼、丁尼生写起牧歌、罗斯金(10)精神错乱，对这些他表示遗憾；现在，他愿意按照作家们的要求，要么退隐不出，要么出头露面，都可以；他和作家们之间比母子关系还要密切——他们实际上是一对孪生子，一枯俱枯，一荣俱荣；文学的命运就决定于他们之间的亲密联盟——这一切证明了（正像我们一开始说过的）选择保护人是至关重要的。但是，怎样才能选得恰当呢？怎样才能写得精彩呢？那就是问题之所在了。

现代随笔


瑞斯先生(1)说得对：随笔散文的历史和起源——它究竟肇始于苏格拉底或是波斯人西拉尼(2)——是不必深究的，因为，像一切仍在活泼生长的东西一样，它的现在较之它的过去更为重要。而且，这种文章族类繁衍甚广，其中某些支派已跻身上流，戴上了华贵的冠冕，另外一些支派却流落在舰队街头(3)，只能混个朝不保夕的日子。何况，随笔这种形式可长可短，它能容纳的内容又是千变万化，可以高论上帝和斯宾诺莎(4)，也可以漫谈海黾和契普赛大街(5)。不过，我们若是翻一翻收录了从1870年到1920年英国随笔作品的这部五卷小书，我们可以看出在混沌状态之中似乎仍有某些原则在起着支配作用，而在我们正要考察的这一段短短的时期内仍然存在着某种类似历史发展的现象。

然而，在一切文学形式之中，随笔是最不需要使用长音节词的。支配此道的根本原则只有一条：它必须给人以乐趣；而促使我们从书架上拿下随笔的目的也只是为了获得乐趣。在一篇随笔当中，一切都要服从于这个目的。它开头第一个字儿就吸引得我们入了迷，直到看完最末一个字儿才能清醒过来。而在这之间，我们会经历种种的感受：欢乐、诧异、趣味、愤慨等。我们也许会随同兰姆飞向幻想的高空，我们也许会随同冲进智慧的深渊，但是我们切不可从这些境界被人唤醒。随笔，就是要把我们团团围住，用一道帷幕将现实世界遮掩起来。

这样的绝艺，很少有人能够达到。不过，要说到责任，那既在作家方面，也在读者方面——他的欣赏口味已经被习惯和惰性弄得迟钝了。小说里有故事，诗歌里有韵律；但是，随笔作家在这些小品文里要运用何等的艺术手段才能使我们清清醒醒地入了迷，处于一种精神恍惚的状态——那不是睡眠，而是一种生命力的强化——或者说，使我们在全部官能都活跃着的时刻沐浴在快快活活的阳光之中呢？他必须精通——这是顶顶要紧的——写作之道。他的学问即使像马克·帕蒂森(6)那样渊博，也得借助于某种写作的幻术将它融化在自己的随笔之中，不让哪一项论据显得突兀，也不让哪一句教条撕破文章结构的表层。在这一点上，麦考莱(7)以一种方式，弗劳德(8)又以另一种方式，多次达到了尽善尽美的地步。他们在一篇文章里灌输给我们的知识比上百部教科书里无数的章节还要多。但是，当马可·帕蒂森要用35页的篇幅向我们讲一讲蒙田的时候，我们却感到他并没有把格仑先生写的东西事先很好地加以消化(9)。格仑先生写过一本很糟的书。他这本书本来应该涂上防腐香料长期保存下来，以供我们慢慢揣摩的。可是，这种加工过程太繁重了，帕蒂森既没有那个时间，也没有那个耐心。于是，他就把格仑先生原封不动地端出来了——那就像烧熟的肉里夹着一颗硬干果，咯得我们的牙生疼。这话差不多也同样适用于马修·阿诺德和某位斯宾诺莎的翻译者(10)。尽讲大道理，或者为了让一个罪犯改恶从善而尽挑他的毛病——这样的口吻对随笔都不合适，因为，随笔里的一切都应该为读者而写，而且还是为了世世代代的读者，并不是单单为了《双周评论》(11)的三月号。在这么一个小小的园地里，千万不要让斥骂人的疾言厉色出现。同时，还有另一种声音，也像一场蝗灾——就是说，作者漫无目的地抓一些模糊概念，像没睡醒似的东一搭西一搭、磕磕巴巴地说下去——譬如下面引的哈顿先生(12)这段文章就是这么一种腔调：

除此以外，他那婚后生活又是非常短暂的，仅仅过了7年半的时间，就突然中断了；而他对于亡妻的天才的热烈崇敬（用他的话说，那简直成了“一种宗教”）就形成那么一种情感（他自己也一定清清楚楚意识到了），它一旦流露于外，就不免表现得过分，至于在世人眼里所引起的错觉就更不必说了；然而，他还被一种无法遏制的渴望死死地纠缠着，想把这种感情用饱含柔情且又热烈奔放的夸张笔法描写下来；因此，想到这么一位靠着自己的“理智之光”而赢得个人声誉的人物，竟然还写得出这些话来，真叫人为之恻然，而且不能不感觉到穆勒先生一生中遭遇的这些事件实在是非常不幸的。

这样的一阵风，对于一部书来说也许还受得了，可是它能把一篇随笔毁掉。不过，要把这些话塞进一部两卷本的传记里倒还合适，因为，在那种书里（我指的是维多利亚时代(13)的那一类老版书）容许出格的自由很宽，对于题外的细节隐约暗示一下或者偶然一瞥，也都属于精神享受之列，因此，书里夹杂些乏味的内容、浮夸的话不算多大问题，说不定还自有其特殊的积极价值。但是，这种由于读者的个人意愿，尽量从一切可能的来源非法塞进书里的价值，在随笔里却必须排除。

随笔里容不得任何文学杂质。无论用什么办法，刻意求工也好，浑然天成也好，两者互相结合也好，随笔总要弄得纯净才是——纯得像水，纯得像酒，只是不可流于单调、死板，也不可含有外来的异物。在第一卷里(14)所收录的作者当中，沃尔特·佩特(15)对这一艰巨任务完成得最好，因为，在他动手写他那篇文章（《论莱奥纳多·达·芬奇札记》(16)）之前，他早已想办法把素材进行了融化。他自然是一位渊博的学者，但是，长留在我们印象中的并不是他那关于莱奥纳多的学问，而是那种远见卓识，正像我们读过一部好小说，感到其中的一切都使我们看清了作者的整个见解。不过，在这篇随笔里，由于范围严格限制，引证材料又要悉如原状，只有像佩特这样的真正作家才能使得这种种局限反倒产生出自己独具的优点来。真实能给文章以权威；范围狭小，正便于给文章定形并进行精雕细刻；何况，这么一来，为旧时代作家所喜爱而为我们所鄙薄，称之为“小零碎儿”的某些修饰成分也就失去了容身之地。如今，谁也不会再有勇气去模拟过去曾经大大有名的关于莱奥纳多笔下那位夫人(17)的描写，她——

通晓坟墓的奥秘；还曾经潜入深海，对于潮水涨落习以为常；又曾与东方商人贸易，换得奇妙的纺织品；身为利达(18)，她便是特洛伊的海伦之母；身为圣安妮，她又是玛利的母亲……(19)

这段文章掉书袋气太重，不会是信笔写下来的。当我们突然又读到了“女人们的微笑和大水的波动”，读到了“像那些身穿暗土色的装裹，安放在灰白色石块中间的死者一样，有一大套讲究的装饰”，我们马上想起来自己也有耳朵、也有眼睛，也想起了成千上万、不计其数的英文词汇曾经充塞于一排排大部头的卷册之中，而其中的许多单词又是不止一个音节。而在当代活着的英国人当中，只有一位出身于波兰血统的先生(20)才看过这些书。自然，这种语言上的节制也使我们免掉了许多大块文章、虚饰字面，免掉了许多神气活现地摆架子、云天雾地地说空话；为了当前占优势的严谨而冷静的文风，我们得甘心情愿地拿出布朗爵士(21)的华丽辞藻、斯威夫特的遒劲气势来做交易。

比起传记和小说，尽管随笔理当拥有更多的神来之笔和明譬暗喻的自由，而且还可以不断润色，直到文章表面上每一点都闪闪发光为止，但是，这也包含着种种危险。首先，我们很快就看到了雕饰。很快，文章的气韵——那本来是文学的生命线——流动得缓慢了；而且，语言，本来应该像流水一样从容不迫、波光粼粼地向前移动的，那样才使人感到一种深邃有力的激动，却一下子凝结成为冰花——就像圣诞树上的葡萄，只能在一夜之间光彩夺目，到第二天就变得灰暗无光而且俗气十足了。题目愈是微不足道，在字面上修饰的诱惑就会愈大。试问：你爱徒步旅行，或者爱在契普赛大街散步，看一看司威丁商店橱窗里的几只海黾，以资消遣——这怎么能让别人发生兴趣呢？对于这些日常琐事的题目，斯蒂文森(22)和塞缪尔·巴特勒采用了两种截然不同的办法引起我们的兴趣。斯蒂文森是按照传统的、18世纪的方式将他的素材加以修饰、点缀、润色的。在这方面，他干得很出色。不过，读着他的随笔，我们不免担心：这种题材，在这位匠师巧手的摆弄之下，恐怕会有耗光用尽之时。铸块如此之小，加工却一直不停。因此，结束语里说——

寂然独坐，陷入沉思——想起了一个个女人的面孔而无动于衷，为许多男子的赫赫功绩所感动亦无妒忌之心，对于事事处处都心怀共鸣却仍安于自己本来的处境和地位(23)——

这就给人一种空虚之感，表明到了文章结尾，作者再也没有什么实实在在的内容可写了。巴特勒采取的是另一种截然相反的写法。他仿佛说：按照你自己的思路去想，然后尽量朴朴实实地把你的想法说出来，就行啦。——在橱窗里陈列的这些海黾，从硬壳里向外伸头露爪的，象征着对于某种既定概念的忠实信守。这样，冷冷淡淡地从一个概念跨到另一个概念，我们穿过了一大片地面；一会儿，看到那个求婚者的伤势严重；一会儿，又想到苏格兰的玛丽女王(24)曾经穿着一双矫形的靴子，在托腾南法院路(25)的蹄铁铺附近大发脾气；一会儿，又想，现在怕是没有人真把埃斯库罗斯(26)放在心上了；如此，等等，穿插着许多好笑的逸闻轶事和一些意味深长的思考，然后，下结论说：他既受人嘱咐，在契普赛大街的观感不得超出《万象评论》(27)中12页的篇幅，他还是就此打住为妙。然而，很明显，巴特勒也像斯蒂文森一样照顾着我们的情趣；而且，把文章写得恰如自己的脾性而又不把这个叫作写作，比起模拟阿狄生的笔调而称之为优秀作品，其实倒是一种艰难得多的风格训练。

但是，无论维多利亚时代的那些随笔作家相互间的差别如何之大，他们仍然具有一点共同之处。一般来说，他们的随笔篇幅比现在的写得要长——因为，他们为之写作的那一批读者不仅有时间坐下来认认真真读自己的刊物，而且还有很高的（尽管是纯属于维多利亚时代所特有的）文化水平，足以评断它的得失。因此，那时候在随笔里就重大问题放言高论也还值得；尽自己力量把文章写好，也没有什么不对，因为先从杂志上高高兴兴地读这篇随笔的读者，再过一两个月还要从书里将它仔仔细细读一遍。但是，读者层从那一小部分有教养的雅士一下子变为一大批不那么有教养的普通人。而且，对于这种变化也不能完全说它不好。在第三卷里，我们看到贝瑞尔先生(28)和比尔博姆先生(29)的文章。我们简直可以说，老式的写法又回来了——随笔虽然缩小了篇幅，文章也不那么讲究声调铿锵，但它倒是更接近阿狄生和兰姆的作品。无论如何，贝瑞尔先生所写的关于卡莱尔(30)的文章和我们假定卡莱尔可能写的关于贝瑞尔先生的文章之间一定会存在着很大的距离。马克斯·比尔博姆写的《一件件的围嘴儿》和莱斯利·斯蒂芬(31)写的《一个玩世不恭者的自辩》之间也很少有什么类似之处。但是，随笔一道仍然生机勃勃，没有什么理由值得灰心丧气。只是情况变了，随笔作家对于舆论界就像含羞草一样敏感，自然是要顺应潮流的。不同的仅仅在于：一个好作家就尽量往好处变，一个坏作家就尽量往坏处变。贝瑞尔先生当然是好作家；因此，我们就看到：虽然他大大压缩了随笔的篇幅，他的抨击倒更能命中要害，他的笔倒更灵活自如了。那么，比尔博姆先生对于随笔到底贡献出什么、又接受了什么呢？这倒是一个复杂得多的问题，因为这位作家全力以赴从事随笔写作，而且无疑是这一行里的名手。

比尔博姆先生贡献出来的，当然就是他自己。自从蒙田的时代以来，“作者的自我”这个东西一阵儿又一阵儿地附着在随笔身上。可是，自打查尔斯·兰姆作古，就再也见不着它的影子。对于读者来说，马修·阿诺德从来也不会是“马特”(32)，沃尔特·佩特也从来没有被千家万户亲亲热热地简称为“沃特”。他们曾经给了我们不少东西，但他们给我们的可不是这个。这样，到了19世纪90年代的某个时候，已经习惯于告诫、灌输和谴责的读者突然听见了跟他们同样并非大人物的一位作者用亲切的口气跟他们谈话，当然是要感到惊奇的。这位作者只谈他如何为了个人私事而高兴、而烦恼，既不宣讲教义，也不传授学问。简单干脆地说，他就是他自己，并且一直保持着自己的本色。我们再一次碰上了一位随笔作家，他能够运用随笔作家本该拥有的，同时也是最危险、最难驾驭的工具。他并非无意识，也非泥沙俱下，而是自觉而又纯粹地把个性带进了文学。我们简直说不清在随笔作家马克斯和比尔博姆先生这两人之间到底有没有什么联系。我们只知道个性的灵气渗透了他所写的每一个字眼儿。这个胜利乃是风格的胜利。因为，个性虽是文学中必不可少之物，却也是它最最危险的对手；你要想在文学中充分发挥你的个性，必须首先深明作文之道。千万不可是你自己而又永远是你自己——这就是问题所在(33)。说老实话，瑞斯先生收入这部文集中的某几位随笔作家并没有圆满地解决这个问题。我们只看到许多琐屑无聊的个人癖性在没完没了的印刷品中一点一点地分解，实在厌烦透了。假如说是聊天儿，那当然不坏，这时候作家还不失为啤酒桌上的好伙伴儿。但是，文学是要求严格的。光是可爱、高尚，甚至博学而有才气，都没有用，除非——她仿佛再三重复地说——你首先满足她提出的第一个条件：深明作文之道。

这种本领，比尔博姆先生已经掌握到炉火纯青的地步。不过，他并没有到字典里去寻找多音节词汇。他也没有造出严密有力的长句子，也不用交错的韵律、奇妙的音调吸引我们的耳朵。而他的有些朋友——譬如说，亨利(34)和斯蒂文森——也许比他更能造成一时轰动的印象。然而，《一件件的围嘴儿》却写得那样灵活、那样热闹、那样意味深长，真像生活本身一样。这样的作品，你不会读过一遍就丢开，正如你跟好朋友一时分手绝不等于交情结束一样。生活中总有些东西不断涌现、不断变化、不断增添。即使在书橱里，有生命的东西也总是有变化的——我们总想再看看它们，看到了又觉得它们跟过去有所不同。因此，我们回过头来，重读比尔博姆先生所写的一篇又一篇文章，心想到了9月里以至明年5月，我们还会坐下来谈论这些文章的。然而，在一切作家当中，随笔作家对于舆论是最最敏感的。现在又时兴在客厅里看书，比尔博姆先生的随笔作品由于灵敏地适应了环境的要求，于是就摆到客厅的桌上了。客厅里不会有杜松子酒，不会有气味呛人的烟草，不会有双关俏皮话，不会有酗酒和疯狂举动。而且，太太先生们要在这里见面谈话，有些事情自然是不便说出来的。

自然，要把比尔博姆先生只关在一间客厅里，不过是一种愚蠢想法；而让这位必须拿出自己最佳作品的艺术家，一定要做我们这个时代的代表，则不幸且更加愚蠢。在这部文集的第四、第五两卷里根本未见有比尔博姆先生的作品。他的时代仿佛有点儿远了，客厅里的那张桌子已经挪开，看上去倒像是往日的一个神坛，人们曾经在那上面摆过祭品——自己果园里出产的果子，或是自己亲手雕刻的什么礼物。如今，环境又一次地变了。读者仍像往日那样需要随笔，甚至或许需要得更多。那些不到1500字、在特殊情况下也不超过1750字的轻松小品文，在报刊上大有供不应求之势。过去兰姆只写一篇文章，比尔博姆也许会写两篇文章的材料，如今到了贝洛克先生(35)手里，粗粗估计一下，也许会写出365篇文章来。这些文章当然很短。可是，这位随笔能手又是多么巧妙地利用这短短的篇幅的呀：他从顶栏的地方开始，一下子就进入正题，看准文章该写到什么程度，什么时候转弯子，然后，一点儿也不糟蹋版面，把笔收回来，恰恰落在编辑所限定的最后一个字眼儿上！这样文字技巧的绝活，真该好好观摩一番。但是，在这么一种写作过程中，贝洛克先生，正如比尔博姆先生一样，所赖以存在的个性可就不免受到了损失。它不是用一种像自自然然说话时那样圆润嘹亮的声音传达到我们这里来，倒像是一个人在刮风天站在麦克风后边可着嗓子向一大群人叫喊那样显得声音单薄、拿腔作调、装模作样。“小朋友们，我的读者们，”他在题为《陌生的国度》的一篇随笔里如此写道，然后，他接着告诉我们说——

“几天前，在芬顿集市上出现了一个牧羊人。他是带着羊群从东方、由路易斯那边来的。他的眼睛里还流露出对于远方地平线的回忆——那使得牧羊人和山民的眼神跟别的人们都不相同……我跟着他，想听听他要说些什么，因为牧羊人谈起话来也跟别人大不一样。”(36)

不过，即使照例有啤酒一杯提神，这位牧羊人关于“陌生的国度”还是谈不出什么。这样也好，因为从他谈出来的唯一的一点儿议论看来：他不过是一个二三流的诗人，根本不适合照看羊群，再不然，他只是拿着自来水笔的贝洛克先生所冒充的人物。这是专业随笔作家现如今必须受到的惩罚——他只好冒充。因为，他一没有工夫写出他自己，二没有工夫写出别人。他只好浮光掠影地撇取一点儿思想的表层，把强有力的个性冲得淡而又淡。他只能每周给我们拿出一枚磨损的半便士铜币，而无法每年给我们拿出一块成色十足的金币。

但是，由于当前条件而受到损失的也不光是贝洛克先生一个人。收入这部文集的以1920年为下限的随笔文章，可能算不得这些作家的最佳作品。不过，我们若把像康拉德先生和赫德森先生(37)这样的偶尔写写随笔的作家排除在外，而专门注意那些以随笔写作为专业的人们，可以看出他们由于环境变化受到相当大的影响。他们每周写，每天写，写得要短，要为那些在早晨匆匆忙忙赶火车的人们而写，也要为那些在傍晚精疲力竭回到家里的人们而写——这对于那些心里明白什么是好文章、什么是坏文章的人来说，是一件伤心的工作。他们这么样写着，但是本能地把一切可能会由于跟公众接触而受到损失的宝贵内容统统抽出来，免遭伤害，同时也抽出了那些可能刺疼读者皮肤的东西。这么一来，如果我们把卢卡斯先生、林德先生或者斯夸尔先生(38)的作品全部拿来读一读，就会感到一种共同的灰暗情调笼罩一切。他们跟沃尔特·佩特的精美绝伦，跟莱斯利·斯蒂芬的直言无忌都相距甚远。本来嘛，要把美和勇气塞进一栏半的篇幅里，同将危险的酒精装进一只小瓶子里一样；要把思想纳入短文章里，也像把牛皮纸包硬塞入背心的小口袋里，一定会把匀称性毁掉的。这些作者是在为一个友善、疲劳而漠不关心的社会而写作。奇迹在于：尽管如此，他们至少仍然在不停地为写出好的作品而进行尝试。

但是，说到随笔作家这种条件方面的变化，我们却不必为此而对克拉顿·布罗克先生(39)表示怜悯。显然，他已经充分利用了他的处境，而不是相反。因为，他这么自自然然地实现了从私人随笔作家到公众随笔作家、从客厅到阿尔伯特纪念堂(40)的转变，我们简直不知道该不该说他在这件事上一定进行过有意识的努力。说来不可思议的是：篇幅缩小了，倒引起了个体的相应膨胀。马克斯和兰姆的“我”不见了，只剩下代表着公共团体和某些高贵人物的“我们”：“我们”去听《魔笛》(41)，“我们”理当从中获得好处；而且，实际上，也是“我们”以全体的资格，在从前某个时候用一种神秘的方式把它写出来的。音乐、文学、艺术必须归入这个总体之中，否则它们就无法传送到阿尔伯特纪念堂的每个角落。克拉顿·布罗克先生那真诚无私的声音既然传播得那么遥远，影响了那么多人，而又不去迁就大家的种种缺点和癖好，对这件事我们理当心满意足才是。然而，“我们”满足了，“我”——人的关系中的这个不听话的伙伴——却陷入了绝望。对于事事物物，“我”都要亲自去想一想，亲自去感受一番。倘若这一切只能经过冲淡之后才能与那许多教养良好、心怀善意的男男女女共同分享，对他来说乃是极大的苦恼；当我们其他人等正在专心一意倾听着这个声音并感到获益匪浅的时候，“我”却悄悄地溜到树林中、田野里，对着一片草叶、一个马铃薯而欣然自乐。

从这部现代随笔选集的第五卷看，我们在欣赏乐趣和写作艺术方面取得了一定进展。但是，为了公平对待1920年的随笔作家们，我们必须肯定：我们颂扬名人，并不是因为他们已经受到过别人颂扬；我们赞美死者，也不是因为我们再也无法在皮卡迪利大街(42)上看到他们穿着套鞋散步。我们也必须知道：我们说他们能写并且给了我们乐趣的时候，这话是有明确含意的。我们要对他们加以比较，好把他们的特点突出出来。我们要指出这一段，说它不错，因为它写得准确、真切而富有新意：

不行，人是无法隐退的，即使到了该退休的时候；他们不愿意隐退，尽管理智如果要求；离群索居，他们无法忍受，尽管人老体衰，需要一个隐退之所——正像有些市民，人老了，仍然想坐在街门口，这么一来，就把他们的老态龙钟摆在外面，让人嘲笑。(43)

我们还要指出这一段，说它不好，因为它写得松散、花哨、俗气：

嘴角上带着彬彬有礼而又玩世不恭的神情，他回想着那清静的少女们的卧室，那在月光下潺潺歌唱的泉水，那如泣如诉的清幽的乐曲声——从阳台上发出，响入开阔的天空，那端庄的主妇——抛伸出防护的手臂、带着警戒的眼神，那在阳光下酣睡的田野，以及那炎热的海港——它华丽又散发出香气……(44)

文章这么一直写下去。可是，种种噪音震得我们晕头转向，什么也感觉不到，什么也听不见了。对比之下，我们觉得写作艺术正是以对于某种思想的强烈执着为其支柱的。正是依靠着某种思想，某种为人深深相信、确切领会并因而获得文字表达形式的思想，那一大批性情各异的作者，包括兰姆和培根，比尔博姆先生和赫德森，维尔农·李(45)和康拉德先生，还有莱斯利·斯蒂芬、巴特勒和沃尔特·佩特，才能到达那遥远的彼岸。而在将思想化为文字这件事情上，形形色色的才士高手曾经起过或则促进、或则阻挠的作用。有人惨淡经营，勉强通过；有人凭借好风，直上青云。但是，贝洛克先生、卢卡斯先生和斯夸尔先生对于任何思想都缺乏热烈的执着。他们面临着当代的共同困境，即缺乏一种顽强的信念——只有它才能将短暂人生的声音透过个人语言所构成的烟雾迷蒙的领域，提升到永恒联合、永恒融洽的国度。一切定义都是含混不清的，但是，一篇好的随笔必须在我们身边拉下一道帷幕，这帷幕一定得把我们围在当中，而不要将我们挡在外面。

伯尼博士(1)的晚会


那次晚会是在1777年或1778年举办的，具体月日不详。那个夜晚天气寒冷。我们的消息大都来自范妮·伯尼，她当时25岁或26岁——这取决于我们把晚会日期到底定在哪一年。不过，想要充分地欣赏晚会，就还得退回几个年头，想方设法去结识一下晚会上的诸位宾客。

范妮自幼喜好写作。她的继母家在金斯林镇，住宅花园的尽头有一所小屋，她常常待在那里写上一下午，直到沿河上行和下行的水手们的叫骂声把她赶回大宅里。不过，只有在下午躲到僻静的角落里，她那半被压抑的惴惴不安的写作热情才能恣意发挥。女孩子写东西被认为有点荒唐可笑；而成年女人写作就是很不相宜的事了。而且，谁也不知道，如果一个姑娘家写开了日记，她会不会说一些不检点的话呢——多莉·扬小姐这样警告过她。多莉·扬小姐虽说丑得要命，在金斯林镇一带可是被公认为品格最高的女子。范妮的继母也不赞成舞文弄墨。但是，这其中的乐趣是那么刻骨铭心——“当我记录下自己每时每刻的念头，记录下我与人初次见面产生的看法，我的快乐无可言传”——因此她不能不写。零星纸头从她的口袋里掉出来，被她父亲捡了去并阅读了，这让她窘困万分。有一次，她被迫在后花园里把所有的文字付之一炬。最后，似乎是达成了某种妥协。早晨是神圣不可侵犯的，用于缝纫之类的正经事；她只有在下午可以在那间临河的瞭望房里涂涂写写——什么信件啦，日记啦，故事啦，诗歌啦，直到水手们的诅咒粗话把她撵回家……

或许，这也有点儿怪。因为，说到底，18世纪是个动不动诅咒发誓的年代。范妮早年的日记里满是这类话：什么“上帝救我”“天打雷劈”“让我五脏俱碎”，还有很多“该死的”“魔鬼般的”，以及诸如此类的词语日复一日、时时刻刻从她亲爱的父亲和备受尊敬的克里斯普老爹(2)嘴里吐出来。或许范妮对语言的态度压根就有点不正常。她非常容易被语言的力量触动，却不像简·奥斯汀那么灵敏或锐利。她崇拜滔滔不绝，崇拜热情奔放、连篇累牍倾倒在印刷纸页上的语言的声音。她读了《拉塞拉斯》(3)，稚嫩的笔端立刻生成了约翰逊博士那种冗长膨大的句子。她小小年纪就不惜大费周折地避免汤姆金斯这类俗名。这样，不管她在花园尽头的小屋里听到了什么，她对它们的反响肯定比大多数别的女孩子强烈，而且，很显然，她既有对声音敏感的耳朵，更有对意义敏感的心灵。她天生有点过于循规蹈矩。就像她想方设法不提汤姆金斯的名字，她同样也努力规避日常生活的粗俗、严酷和平庸。在她笔下，喷涌的词语常常磨平文句的棱角，而可人的情感每每让思想的线索柔顺。这一重要弱点使她异常生动活泼的早年日记有所减色。这样，当范妮听到水手们骂人，就打道回府了，虽然她的隔山姐姐玛丽亚·艾伦可能会留在那里并向河水送个飞吻——至少玛丽亚后来的经历使我们有理由斗胆做如是猜想。

范妮回到主宅内，但不是去独自冥思。不论是在林镇(4)还是在伦敦——说来她们家一年大多数时间是在伦敦的波兰街度过的，她家的宅子里都热热闹闹。竖琴在弹奏，歌声在飘荡，甚至书房里伯尼博士在一大堆笔记本的包围下埋头疯狂写字的沙沙声也似乎历历可闻——如此专注的书写似乎使那声音笼罩了整栋房子。此外，当伯尼家的孩子结束了各自的营生回来，重又聚在一起，就会迸发七嘴八舌的闲谈和朗朗的大笑。没有人比范妮更喜欢家庭生活。因为在家人中，她的腼腆只不过给她带来一个“老夫人”的绰号；她可以对一帮熟悉的听众说俏皮话，她用不着为自己的衣服操心；而且，也许多少因为他们小小年纪母亲就过世了，他们常常通过笑话、传言和窃窃私语表达一种亲近感（他们会说“假发湿了”，并彼此眨眨眼睛）；姐妹兄弟、兄弟姐妹间还不断地聊闲天或讲知心话。毫无疑问，伯尼们——苏珊和詹姆斯和查尔斯和范妮和海蒂和夏洛特——是个有才华的家族。查尔斯是学者，詹姆斯是幽默作家，范妮长于写作，苏珊有音乐天赋——每个人都能在共有的修养之外添点什么专长或特点。他们很幸运，除了拥有天赋，老爸还是个十分受欢迎的音乐家。他靠自己的才能取得了可羡的社会位置，交游甚广，又出身于士绅人家，因而孩子们不费气力就可以既和爵爷们往来又与订书匠打交道，而且享受着一份世人可能企及的最自由自在的生活。

至于伯尼博士本人，由于时间久远，有些事今天看来可能让人不大吃得准。我们很难确知，如果我们现在见到他将如何感受。但有一件事是肯定的——那就是我们到处都可能遇见他。女主人会竞相邀请他。总是有很多的短简在等他批阅。电话铃声将时时打扰他。因为他是大家最需要的大忙人。他总是不停地冲进冲出。有时他带一盒三明治在马车上匆匆吃顿饭。有时他早上7点就出门，直到晚上11点才能教授完他的音乐课回家。他的社交魅力在于“他习以为常的温和风范”，这使他人见人爱。他的作风散漫邋遢——他把所有的东西——笔记、钱币、手稿等，统统扔在一个抽屉里；有一回他丢失了全部存款，不过他的朋友们很心甘情愿地补偿了他的损失。他的经历有时离奇古怪：不是曾有一次，他颠颠簸簸地乘船渡海到多佛(5)后，酣然入睡又被带回了法国，结果只好再渡海峡吗？不过，正是这些使他得到了人们的善待和同情。也许，正因他无处不在，所以面目有点模糊不清。他似乎总在没完没了地写文著书，然后改写，还要求女儿们为他写。与此同时，未经清点分类，甚至也许根本未曾览读过的便笺、书信、宴会请帖劈头倾泻而来，他不能销毁这些东西。他打算有一天将它们辑集加注，于是到最后他似乎消融在一片语词的云雾中了。当他以88岁高龄辞世之后，即使最忠心耿耿的女儿对那一大堆字纸也无可奈何，只得一焚了之。甚至连范妮对语言的热爱都被窒息了。但是，如果说我们对伯尼博士的情感可能有点含糊，范妮可绝不是这样。她敬爱父亲。不管有多少次她不得不放下自己的写作来给父亲抄稿，她也从不介意。而且她的爱也得了回报。虽然伯尼博士希望范妮在宫廷中崭露头角的抱负是不明智的，而且可能差点就搭上了她的性命，不过，当某个讨厌的求婚者穷追不舍时，她开口请求说：“哦，父亲大人，我什么也不想要！只要让我跟着您过就行了！”那位感情冲动的博士立刻就答道：“我的命根儿！只要你乐意，你可以永远跟我在一起。你总不会以为我是想摆脱你吧？”于是，他不仅双眼热泪盈眶，更可叹的是，他从此再也不提巴罗先生了。千真万确，伯尼一家美满和睦，相反相成，搭配奇特；因为其中有姓艾伦的孩子，还有后来出生长大的隔山的小弟弟妹妹。

时间流逝，年复一年，伯尼一家已经无法继续在波兰街住下去了。他们先是搬到了王后广场，后来，在1774年又迁到莱斯特田圣马丁街上那栋牛顿曾经住过的房子；在那里仍然可以见到牛顿的天文观测室和他的带有漆格的住房。伯尼们就在这个地处市中心但低贱的街区里安家落户。范妮在这儿继续涂鸦，偷偷钻进观测室，就像在林镇躲进小木屋那样。她说：“时时把自己的想法记到纸上的快乐真是无法抗拒，我再也抵制不住这种诱惑了。”有很多名人到她家来，有的关起门来和博士在内室谈话；有的像加里克(6)那样，当主人那一头天生美发正被梳理时在一旁陪坐；有的和这家人一道热热闹闹地进餐；更常见的则是聚在一起举行音乐晚会，晚会上全体伯尼家的孩子都参加演出，而他们的父亲则在竖琴琴弦上“紧拨急弹”，也说不定还有杰出的外国音乐家表演个独唱独奏什么的。总之，有那么多人为这样那样的缘故到圣马丁街的那幢房子来，在那里能引人注意的只有那些离奇古怪的人。比如说，我们能记得阿杜加莉，那个令人惊异的女高音，原因是她“在襁褓中时曾被猪伤过，据说，因此她的身体一胁用了个银撑子”。而旅行家布鲁斯能被人记得，是因为“他有个最奇特的毛病。每当他想说话时，他的胃就会像风琴箱一样鼓起来。他倒并不想隐瞒，他说这是在阿比尼西亚落下的毛病。不过，有一天晚上他有点激动，这种状况延续的时间比平常久得多，在场的人都有点害怕了。”

范妮在描述别人时也描绘了自己，我们似乎还记得，她本人总是热切而又轻手轻脚地在客人间穿进穿出，她的眼睛有如蚊蚋般向外突出，她的举止腼腆，有些笨拙。但蚊蚋般的眼和笨拙的举止掩盖了最敏锐的观察力和最长久的记忆力。待客人一走，她就溜进观测室，把每句话每个场面都写进多达12页的长信里，寄给她远在切星顿的亲爱的克里斯普老爹。那位老隐士因为对社会愤愤不满退隐到田野中的房子里——他宣称地窖中的酒、马厩中的坐骑和傍晚一盘双陆棋胜过世界上所有的高朋嘉宾，可却总是迫不及待地想听新闻。如果他的范妮儿没有原原本本把她家的事都告诉他，他就要骂她。而且，若是她没能在词句出现在脑海之际火速写下来，她也要遭他斥责。

克里斯普先生特别想了解“格利维尔先生的情况和他的见解”。因为格利维尔先生实在是永恒的好奇的根源。真是万分遗憾，时光用它的毒尘掩盖了格利维尔先生，结果只有他最突出的特征——他的出身、他的相貌和他的鼻子——还依然能显露出来。福尔克·格利维尔是菲利普·锡德尼爵士的朋友的后裔——这一点曾被多次重复，据此我们猜想那位先生大概着实强调了这一情况。实际上，贵族的冠冕“差一点就落到他头上了”。从仪表上说他身材高大，四肢匀称。“他的面孔、五官及皮肤无不引人注目地体现着男性美。”“他的风度和姿势高雅，流露出自觉的尊严”；他的态度“高高在上，却又十分雍容”。除此以外，我们还得说明，他骑马、弄剑、跳舞和打网球的技艺都高明得令人赞叹。但是，如此杰出的才能和品格又都被一些大缺陷损害了。他极端颐指气使。他自私自利。他三心二意。他脾气暴烈。他最初之所以结识伯尼博士，是因为他怀疑乐师是否适合与绅士为伍，有意考究一下。他发现年轻的伯尼竖琴弹得出神人化，弹奏时还曲着指头拢起手掌；而且伯尼对音乐，比对恩主更感兴趣，因此回答问题时只简简单单地说“是”或者“不”；只是在格利维尔本人凭着记忆固执地拨弄琴弦时，他才感到受不了了，才开始生动的谈话——总之，直到格利维尔发现年轻的伯尼既有才气又有良好的教养，他这个聪明人才不再摆高人一等的架子。伯尼成了他的朋友和侪辈。实际上，伯尼几乎成了他的牺牲品。因为，若是说菲利普·锡德尼爵士的朋友的这位后裔有什么看不起的，那就是“老古板”。在他嘴里那个生动的字眼指的似乎是谨慎、得体等中产阶级德行，它们和被他称为“时髦”的贵族美德正好相反。活就得活个倜傥人时，大胆恣肆，就得不停地向人炫示，即使这种炫示所费不赀，而且对于炫示者和那些被他逼迫不得不进行赞美的不幸的客人来说都同样的乏味——而这后一点恐怕正是那些惊愕地环绕他的领地参观并赞美种种改良措施的来宾的感觉。格利维尔绝不能容忍自己和他人身上的“古板”。他把默默无闻的年轻音乐家抛进怀特俱乐部和纽马基特(7)的生活急流，并饶有兴趣地观看他是沉是浮。伯尼是最机灵的人，游起泳来好像生来就在水里似的。菲利普·锡德尼爵士的朋友的后代大为高兴。伯尼先是他的被保护人，后来成了他的知己。事实上，那位了不起的绅士虽然派头不小，还真缺个朋友。因为，如果我们能除尽盖在格利维尔身上所有的毒尘，就会发现他是那些被截然相反的欲望折磨的不幸的可怜虫之一。一方面他欲火中烧，一心想领导时髦潮流把“事儿”办到，不管那“事儿”多么费钱而无趣。但是另一方面他私下里又认定“以他的头脑和悟性的特点。合适的用武之地乃是研究形而上学”。伯尼说不定是“时髦”世界和古板世界之间的连接环节。他是个有教养的人，能和血性男儿们一道掷色子、下赌注；但同时又是个音乐家，能谈论思想文化问题，并请那些聪明人上他家去。

如此这般，格利维尔待伯尼如同侪，上他们家来做客，他的来访常常被激烈的争吵打断，就是和温顺的伯尼博士本人在一起，他也每每能挑起争端。实在说吧，日子一久，没有人不和格利维尔先生争吵。他在赌桌上输掉很多钱。他的社会声望日渐衰颓。他的积习使家人与他疏离。他妻子瘦骨伶仃，简直适合去让人画“犀利、有权势而又好讥讽的仙后”的肖像，但她其实却是生性温顺宽和的。不过即便她也对格利维尔先生屡次三番的不忠行为感到厌烦了。受此激发，她突然出人意料地写了一阕有名的《淡漠颂》，“被收进所有私下流通的英语文集中”，而且（这是达勃莱夫人的话），这使“她的额头戴上了芳香远播永不消退的花环”。妻子的成名大概让她丈夫更觉芒刺在背，因为他本人也是作家。他曾写了一部《箴言及人物速写》，过去一直“毫不焦急、不失尊严地等待声誉来临，他的期待从没有被怀疑所阻塞”。然而名誉迟迟不来，他可能开始有点着急了。此外呢，他喜欢和聪明人做伴，大半是为满足他的愿望，才在那个异常寒冷的夜里举办了圣马丁街的那次著名的晚会。

那时的伦敦还很小，人们想出人头地比现今要容易得多，他们并不费力气去保持那个地位，而是因众口一词的赞同享有这份殊荣。见到格利维尔太太的人个个都知道并记得她曾写了《淡漠颂》；人人都知道布鲁斯先生曾在阿比西尼亚旅行；同样的，人人都知道斯特里特姆庄园(8)有幢房子是由一位名为史雷尔的夫人当家。史雷尔太太是社会名流，却不曾劳神写诗，不曾在野蛮人中赌命冒险，也没有高贵的爵位或万贯家财。靠运用某些难以言传的能力，史雷尔太太有了出色女主人的名气——要领悟她的那些能力，你必须坐在她的桌边，观察她的千百种大胆言行、巧妙周旋和机智的组合，而这些都已随着特定的时刻而消逝了。她的名声远播到她的住宅之外。从未见过她的人在议论她。人们想知道她到底长什么样儿：她是否真的机敏俏皮、博览群书；那是否只是装装样子而已；她有没有心肝；她爱不爱她那位看来很乏味的酒商丈夫；她为什么嫁给他；约翰逊博士是不是爱上了她——总之一句话，她故事的真面目，她魔力的秘密。因为，无可争议的是，她确实具有影响力。

也许，即使在当时也很难说清这力量从何而来。史雷尔太太具有某种不可名状的特质，她拥有某种永远激发讨论的才能。由于这样或那样的缘故她成了个人物。比如说吧，伯尼家的孩子们从来没见过史雷尔太太或到过斯特里特姆，可她搅起的骚动波及他们所在的圣马丁街。当他们的老爸上斯特里特姆给史雷尔小姐上了第一堂音乐课回家后，他们全都聚到他身边听他讲小姐的妈妈。她真像人们说的那么出类拔萃吗？她和善吗？她狠心吗？他喜欢她吗？伯尼博士兴致极好——这本身证明了女主人的魔力——并回答了问题，我们可以断定，他并没有像范妮所记述的，说她是“头号才女的星座中的一颗明星；她的天赋超群出众，巨大家产又使这些才能得以彰显，为她在世间挣来了显赫声名，她不只是名副其实，而且她的‘实’，远远超过名气”——写那段话时范妮的文风陈旧晦涩，它的叶子簌簌摇动并纷纷扬扬地坠落到地上。我们可以设想，博士轻快地回答说，他在那里待得很高兴；那位夫人很机灵；她时不时地打断音乐课；她的嘴巴很尖刻——这一点是毫无疑问的；但他敢打赌说她归根结底是个好心眼儿的女人。之后呢，他们一定追着问她长什么样。她40岁，但看上去比实际年龄要年轻，挺丰腴，个头不高，有金色的头发和碧蓝的眼，嘴唇上有道伤痕或裂纹。她脸上用了胭脂，其实并不需要，因为她的皮肤本来就是红红的。总的印象是她是个忙碌快活好脾气的人。他说，她是个“劲头十足”的女人，没有谁会认为她是个女学究，那类女人是博士先生最受不了的。不那么明显的是，她非常善于察言观色，那些关于她的轶事可为佐证；她能迸发激情，虽然在斯特里特姆时期尚看不出这点。对于自己作为一个才女或“蓝袜子”(9)的成绩她耐人寻味地采取一种无所谓的随和态度，然而，有趣的是，她却因自己出身于古老的威尔士士绅家庭（史雷尔的家世乏善可陈）而骄傲不已，她时不时地记起在她的血管里，如纹章院(10)所承认的，流淌着萨尔茨堡的亚当家族的血液。

很多女人可能具有上述品质但却没有因此而被人们记住。史雷尔太太除此之外还有一个使她名垂千古的特征，即她作为约翰逊博士的朋友所拥有的势力。若没有这一点，她的生命可能嘶嘶燃烧并化为灰烬，随后荡然无存。但是约翰逊博士和史雷尔太太联合起来就创造出一种在某个意义上像艺术品一样坚实、耐久而出色的东西。而要取得这一成就，史雷尔太太所必须具备的那些能力远比好女主人的品性要罕见得多。当史雷尔夫妇遇到约翰逊时，他正处于极为消沉的状态，哭诉出那么绝望而可怕的话语，史雷尔先生不得不用手堵住他的嘴，不让他说下去。他的身体受着哮喘和浮肿的折磨；他的作风生硬；他的习惯不雅，他的衣裳肮脏，他的假发烧焦了；他的内衣不干净；他还是最最粗鲁的男人。然而史雷尔太太把这个怪物带到布莱顿去，后来又在斯特里特姆庄园里给他单独安置了一个房间，让他每周在那里过几天，最终把他驯化了。当然了，有可能这只是一个搜宝猎奇者的热忱，她肯于忍受无数的不快，可能只是为了让家里有个全英国人都乐意花钱一睹的、独特的约翰逊博士。不过，史雷尔太太的鉴赏力显然比这胜出一筹。她懂得——关于她的轶事是明证——约翰逊博士是奇才、一位重要而给人深刻印象的人，和他做朋友或许不那么舒服但肯定是一种荣耀。在当时，认识到这一点显然不像如今这么容易。当时人们知道的是约翰逊博士将要来吃晚饭。而当约翰逊博士来吃晚饭时，人们就得问问自己还有谁会来。因为，如果来的是个剑桥人就可能会有争吵；如果来个辉格党人肯定会有一场好戏；如果来个苏格兰人，天知道会出什么事。这些都是他的怪癖和成见。其次，人们得琢磨，晚宴上该上哪些食品？因为任何食品都一定会遭到他的批评；即使你给他上从园里摘的嫩豌豆，你也绝不能夸赞它们。这些豌豆真讨人喜欢，是吧？史雷尔太太有一次问道。博士吞了一大堆上面有好多糖的猪肉饼和小牛肉饼，然后冲她开了腔：“对——猪来说豌豆可能是讨人喜欢的。”而后，该谈些什么——就成了下一个伤脑筋的问题。如果谈绘画和音乐，他常会轻蔑地打发掉话题，因为他对那两种艺术不感兴趣。如果有哪位旅行家讲个故事，他肯定会不屑地“唔，唔”，因为他对非亲眼所见的事物一概不信。如果有人当他的面表示同情，很可能会被谴责为不真诚。

有一天，正当我在悲悼一个在美洲死去的表亲的时候，他说：“亲爱的，请别装腔作势号丧了，我倒要请教，即使您所有的亲戚都像云雀一样被叉住烤了，给普雷斯托做了晚餐，这个世界又能有什么损失呢？”

一言以蔽之，那顿饭将困难重重；不定什么时候就会触礁。

如果史雷尔太太仅仅是个一般的浅薄猎奇者，她就会拿约翰逊展示上一阵子后就甩了他。但史雷尔太太那时就已经认识到了，即使约翰逊博士讥讽、呵斥、惹恼和得罪了你，你也得忍着点儿，因为——说到头，是什么力量使博斯韦尔那种骄傲鲁莽的年轻人一听约翰逊吩咐就像个挨了揍的小男孩似的重新在自己的椅子上悄悄坐下？她本人又为什么给他斟茶倒水一直熬到早晨4点钟？因为他身上有种力量，即使是见过世面的能干女人也不能不敬畏，即使是老脸厚皮、自以为是的小伙子也不能不折服。他有权利责骂史雷尔太太不仁义，因为她知道他每年只在自己身上花70英镑，其他的收入全都用来养活一大家子身体衰弱而又不知感恩的寄居者。如果说他在餐桌上狼吞虎咽、在围墙上把桃子扯下来，可他也非常准时地回伦敦查看他那些倒霉的住户周末是否确有三餐好饭食。此外，他还是一所知识的仓库。如果舞蹈师议论起舞蹈，约翰逊能比他谈的还多。他能一小时一小时地讲下层社会的故事让人听得津津有味，讲那些酒徒和无赖，那些家伙骚扰他的住所，要求他解囊施舍。他随口说出的话让人终生难忘。但也许比所有这些学问和德行更让人喜欢的是他对享乐的喜好，是他对书蠹的蔑视和对生活与社交的热情。此外，史雷尔太太像所有的女人那样，因他的勇气而爱他——他曾在博克莱尔先生的客厅里把两只撕咬成一团的恶狗分开；他曾把一个男人，连同椅子和别的东西，统统扔到剧场正厅的后面；而且，像他那么个眼力极差、四肢痉挛的人，还曾在布莱特斯顿但斯一带跟着猎狗骑马驰骋打猎，好像他是条快活的狗而不是个身躯庞大的忧郁的老人。再有呢，他们两人天性不无相近之处。史雷尔太太能让约翰逊淋漓尽致地发挥。她让约翰逊说出了没有她就不可能说的话；事实上，约翰逊曾向她坦述自己青年时代的一些痛苦的秘密，而她对此一直守口如瓶。最重要的是，他们热衷于相同的事。他们谈起话来都没个够。

因此，我们可以万无一失地指靠史雷尔太太把约翰逊博士带来；而约翰逊博士，当然就是格利维尔先生最想会见的那个人了。正巧，伯尼博士相隔多年后和约翰逊博士重修了旧谊：他去斯特里特姆庄园教授第一节音乐课时，约翰逊博士也在那儿，并且“拿出了他最和蔼的面目”。因为他记得伯尼博士，心怀好感。他记得伯尼曾写信给他称赞词典；他还记得伯尼多年以前曾拜访他，发现他不在家，就擅自从炉塘扫帚上剪下几根棕转送给某个约翰逊的崇拜者。当他们在斯特里特姆再次见面时，约翰逊立刻就喜欢上伯尼了；不久后史雷尔太太又带他去看了伯尼博士的藏书；因此，在那1777年或1778年的早春之夜，由伯尼博士出面，让格利维尔先生一遂会见约翰逊博士和史雷尔太太的大愿，并不是什么难事。日子定下了，万事都已安排就绪。

不论到底是哪一天，主人在日历上标出这个日子的时候必定多少心怀疑虑。什么事都可能发生。这么多引人注目而且超群出众的人晤面，可能极为风光也可能是大灾难。约翰逊博士咄咄逼人；格利维尔先生高高在上；格利维尔太太是某一方面的社会名人；史雷尔太太则是另一类名流。因此这就成了一个重要场合。人人都觉得如此。才子们将绞尽脑汁；满怀期待的人会紧张注视。伯尼博士预见到了这些困难并采取了措施来避免它们，不过，我们不免恍惚地觉得，伯尼博士在有些方面恐怕有点木。他是个热心、善良、忙忙活活的人，满脑子是音乐，满抽屉是字条，缺少点辨别力。人的性格的确切线条被一片随意弥散的粉红色晕掩盖了。对于他的天真头脑来说，音乐就是万应的灵药。人人都应像他一样乐此不疲。如果出现什么问题，音乐一定会使之化解。于是他邀请了皮奥齐先生参加晚会。

那个夜晚来了，炉火点燃了。椅子摆好了，客人也到了。如伯尼博士所料，场面相当尴尬。看来确实是从一开始就出了岔子。约翰逊博士戴着他的毛纱假发来了，干干净净的，显然准备过一个开心的夜晚。但是，格利维尔先生看了他一眼以后，似乎认为老头子什么地方有点可怕，觉得最好还是别和他竞争，最好还是当个温良的好绅士，让文学先挑话头。他似乎嘟囔地说了句牙痛什么的，一边“摆出他最最高高在上、盛气凌人的神情立到了火炉边，一动不动，像尊高贵的雕像”。他一言不发。而格利维尔太太呢，虽然她很想出风头，但是断定还是应该由约翰逊博士先发话，于是她也没说什么。本来可以指望史雷尔太太来打破僵局，可她似乎觉得这又不是她开的晚会，该让那些主要人物采取行动，也决定不开口。格利维尔夫妇的女儿克鲁太太又可爱又活泼，不过她是来享受并受教育的，因此自然也不说什么。谁也不说话。晚会上一派沉寂。这就是伯尼博士聪明地预见到的局面。他向意大利的皮奥齐先生点点头；皮先生就走到钢琴旁开始唱歌。他唱起一曲“自由咏叹调”，同时在钢琴上为自己伴奏。他唱得很美，唱出了他的最好水平。可是，音乐不仅没有消除尴尬气氛让人开口说话，反而让人更加拘束。谁也不说话，人人都等着约翰逊博士开口。在这事上，他们暴露了致命的无知，因为，有一件事约翰逊博士是从来都不做的，那就是挑头说话。先得有别人开始，然后他再决定是继续这个话题呢，还是推翻它。此刻他默默地等待别人向他发出挑战。可是他白等了。谁也不说话。谁也不敢说。皮奥齐先生的急奏不受打扰地继续下去。约翰逊发现，进行愉快的晚间谈话的机会被钢琴的鸣响淹没了，他便闷不作声，心不在焉地背对钢琴坐着，望着炉火。“自由咏叹”仍不受打扰地进行着。最后，气氛紧张得让人无法忍受了。最后，史雷尔太太实在受不了啦。显然，是格利维尔先生的态度惹她生了气。他站在炉火前“古怪地沉默着，讥讽地环视着所有的人”。就算他是菲利普·锡德尼爵士的朋友的后裔，他又有什么权利看不起与会的其他人而只是一心专注于炉火？她自己的家族自豪感突然爆发了。她的血管里流的不是萨尔茨堡的亚当的血液吗？它难道不是像格利维尔家的血统一样高贵，甚至更加辉煌吗？在史雷尔太太心里有时翻腾着一股无所顾忌的劲头，这时这股劲儿占了上风，她于是站起来，蹑手蹑脚地走到钢琴边。皮奥齐先生仍旧一边唱一边戏剧性地为自己伴奏。史雷尔太太开始滑稽可笑地模仿他的姿势：她全盘照搬他的动作，耸肩，翻眼，忽而又把头向一边倾去。由于这奇异的表演，客人们开始哧哧地笑——这是后来“满伦敦每个圈子的人”都争相描绘的场面，“还加上了各种各样的评论和讥讽之辞”。那晚看过史雷尔太太表演的人后来永远不会忘记这就是那桩造孽的恋情的发端，是那场让史雷尔太太失去朋友和子女敬重、使她名誉扫地地离开英国并且几乎再也不能在伦敦露面的“最不同寻常的戏剧”的第一幕——她后来爱上了那个既是乐师又是外国人的家伙，而这是那桩最应受谴责、最违背自然的爱情的起始(11)。不过这些后事还都在诸神手里攥着呢。那会儿还没人知道这位活泼的夫人能干出多么邪的事。此时她仍是富有酒商的受尊敬的妻子。幸运的是，约翰逊博士正冲着炉火出神，对钢琴边的场面一无所知。不过，伯尼博士立刻制止了笑声。在一位客人——就算他又是外国人又是乐师——的背后耍笑他，这让伯尼震惊不已，他悄悄走到史雷尔太太身边，低声在她耳边说，即使她不喜欢音乐，也应该照顾欣赏音乐的人的情感。他的口气和蔼却不乏威严。史雷尔太太接受了责备，点头认可，回到她的座位，柔顺得令人赞叹。但她的戏已经演完了。此后可不能指望她再有任何举措了。他们想干什么干什么吧——她可不想掺和了。她坐在那儿，如她自己后来所说，“像个漂亮的小姑娘”，忍受着“她所见识过的最没劲的夜晚之一”的剩余的安排。

如果连一开头都没人敢招呼约翰逊博士，这会儿就更不可能有人出头了。约翰逊显然已经断定，不能指望这天的晚会上出现什么有意思的谈话了。如果他没穿最好的衣裳来，衣兜里倒可能会有本书，可以拿出来读一读。但现在除了脑子里的资源就没什么别的可以指靠了。当然了，他脑子里的存货也多着呢。当他背对钢琴坐着的时候，他就正在开发这些资源，看去像是体现凝重、尊严和安详的塑像。

终于，“自由咏叹”结束了。皮奥齐先生看到没人可以交谈，寂寞中打起瞌睡来。到这时连伯尼博士也一定看出音乐不是万无一失的特效药了，但是事到如今却已无计可施。既然人们不肯讲话，就只好继续听音乐。他叫他的女儿们来了个二重唱。等那结束后又只好再唱一首。皮奥齐先生仍未睡醒，或是仍在装睡。约翰逊博士仍在发掘自己头脑中的丰富资源。格利维尔先生仍不可一世地站在炉前地毯上。而且那个夜晚天很冷。

不过，如果因为约翰逊博士看来是在出神，而且他的视力很差，肯定几乎什么也看不见，就认为他对房间里发生的事——特别是那些应该谴责的事情——毫无知晓，那可就大错特错了。他的“视力突发”一向出人意料而且几乎总是令人痛苦的。在这个场合也是如此。他突然醒过来，他突然振作了，他突然开了口，而所有的人整个晚上都在等他说话。

“如果不是怕妨碍了女士们取暖，”他盯着格利维尔说，“我也想待在炉火前边呢！”突然的发话振聋发聩。伯尼家的孩子们后来说它的效果有如一出喜剧。菲利普·锡德尼爵士的朋友的后代在博士的注视下畏缩了。所有的布鲁克斯家族(12)的血液都聚集起来抗击这一羞辱。得教训那个书商的儿子明白自己的身份，格利维尔尽力挤出笑意——勉强的、嘲讽的微笑。他努力维持待在自己整晚站立的地方。有那么两三分钟，他微笑地站着，他站着努力微笑。不过，当他环视房间时，他发现所有的人都垂下了眼睛，所有的面孔都因感到有趣而抖动，所有的同情都显然在书商的儿子一边，于是他没法在那儿站下去了。福尔克·格利维尔溜开了，甚至垂下了他骄傲的肩膀，坐到了一只椅子上。不过，他边走边“用力”地摇铃。他要求备马车。

“晚会就这么散了；参与的人没有谁请求或希望再举办一次类似的聚会。”

伯爵的侄女


小说的一个侧面，所涉及的事非常微妙，因此，虽然它相当重要，却很少被提到。我们理应装聋作哑地略过阶级差别：照理说任何一个人的出身应该和其他别的人一样好。但是英国小说里却充斥着社会等级的上层和下层，如果没有了这些，它简直就面目全非了。梅瑞狄斯在《奥普勒将军与坎珀夫人》中记述道：“他传话自己马上就去陪坎珀夫人，随后赶紧整理自己的行头。坎珀夫人是一位伯爵的侄女。”所有的英国人毫不犹豫地接受这个说法，而且明白梅瑞狄斯写得正确。一名将军在这种情况下肯定得额外刷一刷他的外衣。虽然将军有可能和坎珀夫人平起平坐，但上述说法却使我们明白他实际要低一等。他受到她的级别的震撼，无遮无拦地。没有伯爵、男爵或骑士等名分保护他。他不过是个英国绅士，而且是个穷绅士。因此，即使对今日的英国读者来说，他在会见坎珀夫人之前“整理他的行头”是完全应当的。

设想社会差别的消失毫无用处。每个人都可以号称自己没有觉得受到这类约束，说他所存身的天地很大，使他足以为所欲为。但这是个幻象。在夏日的街巷里，闲散的漫步者可能亲眼看到披着头巾的打杂女工在成功人士的绫罗绸缎中挤路而行；他可以看到女店员把鼻子贴在汽车的玻璃窗上张望；还可看到容光焕发的青年和气宇轩昂的老者等待召唤觐见乔治王。不同等级之间也许并无敌意，但也没有交流。我们被圈围、被分隔、被断绝。我们一旦在小说的镜子里看到自己，立刻认出这就是真相。小说家，尤其是英国的小说家知道，并且似乎很高兴地知道，社会乃是由许多彼此隔离的玻璃匣子构成的巢，每个匣子里住着一个有特殊习俗和品性的集团。他知道世间有伯爵而伯爵们还有侄女；他知道世上有将军而且将军们在拜会伯爵的侄女以前要刷外套。不过这些只是他的知识中的ABC。因为在此后几页之内，梅瑞狄斯让我们了解到，不仅伯爵有侄女，将军们也有表亲，表亲们又有朋友，朋友有厨娘，厨娘有丈夫，而将军们的表亲的朋友的厨娘的丈夫是一些木匠。这些人中的每一个都生活在他自己的玻璃匣子里，都有小说家需要顾及的特殊的习性。从表面看来中产阶级各集团广泛平等，其实满不是那么回事。种种奇特的脉络和线条横贯社会大众，把男人和男人、女人和女人分割开来；神秘的“有权”和“无权”常常那么缥缈，根本不能用名号之类粗笨的东西来标识，它们却妨碍着、打乱着人类交流的伟业。当我们小心翼翼地穿过了从伯爵的侄女到将军表亲的朋友等一系列社会等级之后，我们还将面临深渊，一道鸿沟赫然展现在我们的面前，对岸则是工人阶级。像简·奥斯汀那样的判断力和趣味都无懈可击的作家仅仅对那深沟略瞥一眼；她把自己局限于本人所从属的那个特殊的阶级并发现其中还有无数的层次。然而，对于像梅瑞狄斯这类性情活泼、喜好追究和争论的作家来说，探索的诱惑是不可抗拒的。他在社会琴键上上下下地摸索，按按这个按按那个；他非让伯爵和厨娘、将军和农民各自发言并在极为复杂的英国文明生活的喜剧中出演角色。

他尝试这么做是很自然的。具有喜剧精神的作家对这种种阶级差别欣赏不已；对此他可以把握，可以卖弄。没有了伯爵的女儿和将军的表亲，英国小说会一派荒凉。它就会像俄国的小说，就得依仗灵魂的无限性和人类的友爱亲情；它就会像俄国小说一样缺少喜剧。不过，我们虽然意识到我们从伯爵的侄女和将军的表亲那里获益良多，但有时也不免有些怀疑，在这些卷了刃的锋端玩讽刺，所得的乐趣是否当真抵得上我们为之付出的代价。因为代价很昂贵。小说家常常不得不勉为其难。梅瑞狄斯在两个短篇小说中非常英勇地试图跨越鸿沟，一步迈过许多不同的等级。他一会儿用伯爵侄女的口气说话，一会儿用木匠妻子的口气说话。不能说他的大胆尝试获得了圆满成功。你会觉得（这也许没有根据），伯爵侄女的脾气未必像他写的那么苛刻严厉。贵族恐怕并不总是像他从他的角度所表现的那么趾高气扬、唐突古怪。尽管如此，他笔下的大人物还比小人物要成功些。他的厨娘都太丰满肥胖，他的农民都太红润朴实。他过分地突出精气神以及血性、挥拳和拍腿。他离他们太远了，没法得心应手地写他们。

因此，小说家，特别是英国的小说家，有时会显得无能为力，而其他艺术家却从没有受到同样程度的困扰。他的出身影响他的作品。他注定只可能深切地了解本社会阶层的人并恰如其分地描绘他们。他不可能逃脱自己在其中生长的那个匣子。纵览小说，就会发现狄更斯的作品中没有绅士；萨克雷的书里没有工人。人们对简·爱算不算淑女不大有把握；而奥斯汀的伊丽莎白们和爱玛们则只能是淑女，绝不会被认作别的类型。想找出个公爵或清洁工纯粹是白费力气——我们简直怀疑，这些处于阶级等级末端的人在别的任何地方也进不了小说。因此，我们不免得出黯淡然而却诱发好奇心的结论，认定小说比它本来所可能达到的水准要贫乏得多，而且这在很大程度上阻碍了我们了解社会的高层或底层发生的事——因为小说家们毕竟是些了不起的阐释者。可以借以猜测世间最高层人物心态的证据几乎没有。国王怎样感受？公爵如何思考？我们无从知晓。因为世上的最高层人士很少写东西，而且从来不写他们自己。我们从来不知道在路易十四本人眼里路易十四的朝廷是怎样的。看来，很可能英国的贵族有一天归于消亡或和平民百姓融为一体，却始终未留下任何有关他们的真实图画。

不过，若是与我们对工人阶级的无知相比，我们对贵族的无知就简直不算什么了。各个时期里英国和法国的大户人家都喜欢在家里款待名人，于是萨克雷、迪斯雷利和普鲁斯特之流对贵族生活的式样和风气相当熟悉，写起它们来也就颇有把握。然而不幸的是，按照生活的规则，文学上的成功总是意味着作家的攀升，而从不带来地位下降，也很少造成广泛接触各个社会等级——而这是更值得向往的。管道工夫妇绝不会纠缠正在发迹的小说家去和他们一道喝酒吃海螺。他的作品不会引起他和生产猫食的工人打交道，也不会促使他与在大英博物馆门口卖火柴、鞋带的老太太开始通信。他有了钱；他有了身份；他购买一套晚礼服并和同侪一道用餐。因此，成功的小说家的后期作品所表现的社会等级总是稍许有些上升。我们往往会得到越来越多的关于成功者和佼佼者的描述。另一方面，莎士比亚时代的老捕鼠人和老马夫彻底地挪出了场景，或是更让人难以接受地成了被怜悯和好奇的对象。他们被用来衬托有钱人。他们被用来指示等级制度的弊端。他们不再像在乔叟写作的时代里那样单单纯纯是他们自己。因为，让工人们用自己的语言写自己的生活似乎已经是不可能的事了。受到教育，能读会写，就意味着使人大大加强自我意识或阶级意识，或使他们脱离原来从属的阶级。只有中产阶级的作家才享有匿名的特权，在它的荫庇下可以从容地写作。作家们雨后春笋般地从中产阶级里产生，因为只有在中产阶级里写作活动才像锄地盖房一样是自然而然、司空见惯的。因此，拜伦当诗人准比济慈要难；而一位公爵成为伟大的小说家简直就像由柜台后的买卖人来写《失乐园》一样，是不可思议的。

然而事情总在变化，阶级差别并不总是像如今这么生硬固定。伊丽莎白时代在这方面要比现在有弹性得多，而我们又不像维多利亚时代的人那么狭隘守旧。因此，很可能我们正处在某种前所未有的大变化的前夜。再过大约一个世纪，所有这些阶级差别都可能不再有什么意义。我们所了解的公爵和农工可能像鸨鸟和野猫一样消失得无影无踪。人与人之间只剩下头脑和性格等方面的自然差别。奥普勒将军（如果那时还有将军的话）将不必刷外衣（如果那时还有外衣）就去见伯爵（如果还有伯爵）的侄女（如果还有侄女）。不过，如果有一天连将军、侄女、伯爵和外衣统统都没有了，英国的小说会落到何等田地，我们实在无从想象。它可能变得面目全非，让我们根本无法认出。它可能会消亡。我们的后代可能很少写小说，即使写也不成功，就像在我们的时代里诗剧创作的情形那样。真正民主时代的艺术将是——什么呢？

Defoe


The fear which attacks the recorder of centenaries lest he should find himself measuring a diminishing spectre and forced to foretell its approaching dissolution is not only absent in the case of Robinson Crusoe but the mere thought of it is ridiculous．It may be true that Robinson Crusoe is two hundred years of age upon the twenty-fifth of April 1919，but far from raising the familiar speculations as to whether people now read it and will continue to read it，the effect of the bi-centenary is to make us marvel that Robinson Crusoe，the perennial and immortal，should have been in existence so short a time as that．The book resembles one of the anonymous productions of the race rather than the effort of a single mind；and as for celebrating its centenary we should as soon think of celebrating the centenaries of Stonehenge itself．something of this we may attribute to the fact that we have all had Robinson Crusoe read aloud to us as children，and were thus much in the same state of mind towards Defoe and his story that the Greeks were in towards Homer．It never occurred to us that there was such a person as Defoe，and to have been told that Robinson Crusoe was the work of a man with a pen in his hand would either have disturbed us unpleasantly or meant nothing at all．The impressions of childhood are those that last longest and cut deepest．It still seems that the name of Daniel Defoe has no right to appear upon the title-page of Robinson Crusoe，and if we celebrate the bicentenary of the book we are making a slightly unnecessary allusion to the fact that，like Stonehenge，it is still in existence．

The great fame of the book has done its author some injustice；for while it has given him a kind of anonymous glory it has obscured the fact that he was a writer of other works which，it is safe to assert，were not read aloud to us as children．Thus when the Editor of the Christian World in the year 1870 appealed to“the boys and girls of England”to erect a monument upon the grave of Defoe，which a stroke of lightning had mutilated，the marble was inscribed to the memory of the author of Robinson Crusoe．No mention was made of Moll Flanders．Considering the topics which are dealt with in that book，and in Roxana，Captain Singleton，Colonel Jack and the rest，we need not be surprised，though we may be indignant，at the omission．We may agree with Mr．Wright，the biographer of Defoe，that these“are not works for the drawing-room table”．But unless we consent to make that useful piece of furniture the final arbiter of taste，we must deplore the fact that their superficial coarseness，or the universal celebrity of Robinson Crusoe，has led them to be far less widely famed than they deserve．On any monument worthy of the name of monument the names of Moll Flanders and Roxana，at least，should be carved as deeply as the name of Defoe．They stand among the few English novels which we can call indisputably great．The occasion of the bicentenary of their more famous companion may well lead us to consider in what their greatness，which has so much in common with his，may be found to consist．

Defoe was an elderly man when he turned novelist，many years the predecessor of Richardson and Fielding，and one of the first indeed to shape the novel and launch it on its way．But it is unnecessary to labour the fact of his precedence，except that he came to his novel-writing with certain conceptions about the art which he derived partly from being himself one of the first to practise it．The novel had to justify its existence by telling a true story and preaching a sound moral．“This supplying a story by invention is certainly a most scandalous crime”，he wrote．“It is a sort of lying that makes a great hole in the heart，in which by degrees a habit of lying enters in．”Either in the preface or in the text of each of his works，therefore，he takes pains to insist that he has not used his invention at all but has depended upon facts，and that his purpose has been the highly moral desire to convert the vicious or to warn the innocent．Happily these were principles that tallied very well with his natural disposition and endowments．Facts had been drilled into him by sixty years of varying fortunes before he turned his experience to account in fiction．“I have some time ago summed up the Scenes of my life in this distich，”he wrote：

No man has tasted differing fortunes more，

And thirteen times I have been rich and poor．

He had spent eighteen months in Newgate and talked with thieves，pirates，highwaymen，and coiners before he wrote the history of Moll Flanders．But to have facts thrust upon you by dint of living and accident is one thing；to swallow them voraciously and retain the imprint of them indelibly，is another．It is not merely that Defoe knew the stress of poverty and had talked with the victims of it，but that the unsheltered life，exposed to circumstances and forced to shift for itself，appealed to him imaginatively as the right matter for his art．In the first pages of each of his great novels he reduces his hero or heroine to such a state of unfriended misery that their existence must be a continued struggle，and their survival at all the result of luck and their own exertions．Moll Flanders was born in Newgate of a criminal mother；Captain Singleton was stolen as a child and sold to the gipsies；Colonel Jack，though“born a gentleman，was put ‘prentice to a pickpocket”；Roxana starts under better auspices，but，having married at fifteen，she sees her husband go bankrupt and is left with five children in“a condition the most deplorable that words can express”．

Thus each of these boys and girls has the world to begin and the battle to fight for himself．The situation thus created was entirely to Defoe's liking．From her very birth or with half a year's respite at most，Moll Flanders，the most notable of them，is goaded by“that worst of devils，poverty”，forced to earn her living as soon as she can sew，driven from place to place，making no demands upon her creator for the subtle domestic atmosphere which he was unable to supply，but drawing upon him for all he knew of strange people and customs．From the outset the burden of proving her right to exist is laid upon her．She has to depend entirely upon her own wits and judgement，and to deal with each emergency as it arises by a rule-of-thumb morality which she has forged in her own head．The briskness of the story is due partly to the fact that having transgressed the accepted laws at a very early age she has henceforth the freedom of the outcast．The one impossible event is that she should settle down in comfort and security．But from the first the peculiar genius of the author asserts itself，and avoids the obvious danger of the novel of adventure．He makes us understand that Moll Flanders was a woman on her own account and not only material for a succession of adventures．In proof of this she begins，as Roxana also begins，by falling passionately，if unfortunately，in love．That she must rouse herself and marry some one else and look very closely to her settlements and prospects is no slight upon her passion，but to be laid to the charge of her birth；and，like all Defoe's women，she is a person of robust understanding．Since she makes no scruple of telling lies when they serve her purpose，there is something undeniable about her truth when she speaks it．She has no time to waste upon the refinements of personal affection；one tear is dropped，one moment of despair allowed，and then“on with the story”．She has a spirit that loves to breast the storm．She delights in the exercise of her own powers．When she discovers that the man she has married in Virginia is her own brother she is violently disgusted；she insists upon leaving him；but as soon as she sets foot in Bristol，“I took the diversion of going to Bath，for as I was still far from being old so my humour，which was always gay；continued so to an extreme”．Heartless she is not，nor can any one charge her with levity；but life delights her，and a heroine who lives has us all in tow．Moreover，her ambition has that slight strain of imagination in it which puts it in the category of the noble passions．Shrewd and practical of necessity，she is yet haunted by a desire for romance and for the quality which to her perception makes a man a gentleman．“It was really a true gallant spirit he was of，and it was the more grievous to me．'Tis something of relief even to be undone by a man of honour rather than by a scoundrel”，she writes when she had misled a highwayman as to the extent of her fortune．It is in keeping with this temper that she should be proud of her final partner because he refuses to work when they reach the plantations but prefers hunting，and that she should take pleasure in buying him wigs and silver-hilted swords“to make him appear，as he really was，a very fine gentleman”．Her very love of hot weather is in keeping，and the passion with which she kissed the ground that her son had trod on，and her noble tolerance of every kind of fault so long as it is not“complete baseness of spirit，imperious，cruel，and relentless when uppermost，abject and low-spirited when down”．For the rest of the world she has nothing but good-will．

Since the list of the qualities and graces of this seasoned old sinner is by no means exhausted we can well understand how it was that Borrow's apple-woman on London Bridge called her“blessed Mary”and valued her book above all the apples on her stall；and that Borrow，taking the book deep into the booth，read till his eyes ached．But we dwell upon such signs of character only by way of proof that the creator of Moll Flanders was not，as he has been accused of being，a mere journalist and literal recorder of facts with no conception of the nature of psychology．It is true that his characters take shape and substance of their own accord，as if in despite of the author and not altogether to his liking．He never lingers or stresses any point of subtlety or pathos，but presses on imperturbably as if they came there without his knowledge．A touch of imagination，such as that when the Prince sits by his son's cradle and Roxana observes how“he loved to look at it when it was asleep”，seems to mean much more to us than to him．After the curiously modern dissertation upon the need of communicating matters of importance to a second person lest，like the thief in Newgate，we should talk of it in our sleep，he apologises for his digression．He seems to have taken his characters so deeply into his mind that he lived them without exactly knowing how；and，like all unconscious artists，he leaves more gold in his work than his own generation was able to bring to the surface．

The interpretation that we put on his characters might therefore well have puzzled him．We find for ourselves meanings which he was careful to disguise even from his own eye．Thus it comes about that we admire Moll Flanders far more than we blame her．Nor can we believe that Defoe had made up his mind as to the precise degree of her guilt，or was unaware that in considering the lives of the abandoned he raised many deep questions and hinted，if he did not state，answers quite at variance with his professions of belief．From the evidence supplied by his essay upon the“Education of Women”we know that he had thought deeply and much in advance of his age upon the capacities of women，which he rated very high，and the injustice done to them，which he rated very harsh．

I have often thought of it as one of the most barbarous customs in the world，considering us as a civilised and a Christian country，that we deny the advantages of learning to women．We reproach the sex every day with folly and impertinence；which I am confident，had they the advantages of education equal to us，they would be guilty of less than ourselves．

The advocates of women's rights would hardly care，perhaps，to claim Moll Flanders and Roxana among their patron saints；and yet it is clear that Defoe not only intended them to speak some very modern doctrines upon the subject，but placed them in circumstances where their peculiar hardships are displayed in such a way as to elicit our sympathy．Courage，said Moll Flanders，was what women needed，and the power to“stand their ground”；and at once gave practical demonstration of the benefits that would result．Roxana，a lady of the same profession，argues more subtly against the slavery of marriage．She“had started a new thing in the world”the merchant told her；“it was a way of arguing contrary to the general practise”．But Defoe is the last writer to be guilty of bald preaching．Roxana keeps our attention because she is blessedly unconscious that she is in any good sense an example to her sex and is thus at liberty to own that part of her argument is“of an elevated strain which was really not in my thoughts at first，at all”．The knowledge of her own frailties and the honest questioning of her own motives，which that knowledge begets，have the happy result of keeping her fresh and human when the martyrs and pioneers of so many problem novels have shrunken and shrivelled to the pegs and props of their respective creeds．

But the claim of Defoe upon our admiration does not rest upon the fact that he can be shown to have anticipated some of the views of Meredith，or to have written scenes which（the odd suggestion occurs）might have been turned into plays by Ibsen．Whatever his ideas upon the position of women，they are an incidental result of his chief virtue，which is that he deals with the important and lasting side of things and not with the passing and trivial．He is often dull．He can imitate the matter-of-fact precision of a scientific traveller until we wonder that his pen could trace or his brain conceive what has not even the excuse of truth to soften its dryness．He leaves out the whole of vegetable nature，and a large part of human nature．All this we may admit，though we have to admit defects as grave in many writers whom we call great．But that does not impair the peculiar merit of what remains．Having at the outset limited his scope and confined his ambitions he achieves a truth of insight which is far rarer and more enduring than the truth of fact which he professed to make his aim．Moll Flanders and her friends recommended themselves to him not because they were，as we should say，“picturesque”；nor，as he affirmed，because they were examples of evil living by which the public might profit．It was their natural veracity，bred in them by a life of hardship，that excited his interest．For them there were no excuses；no kindly shelter obscured their motives．Poverty was their taskmaster．Defoe did not pronounce more than a judgement of the lips upon their failings．But their courage and resource and tenacity delighted him．He found their society full of good talk，and pleasant stories，and faith in each other，and morality of a homemade kind．Their fortunes had that infinite variety which he praised and relished and beheld with wonder in his own life．These men and women，above all，were free to talk openly of the passions and desires which have moved men and women since the beginning of time，and thus even now they keep their vitality undiminished．There is a dignity in everything that is looked at openly．Even the sordid subject of money，which plays so large a part in their histories，becomes not sordid but tragic when it stands not for ease and consequence but for honour，honesty，and life itself．You may object that Defoe is humdrum，but never that he is engrossed with petty things．

He belongs，indeed，to the school of the great plain writers，whose work is founded upon a knowledge of what is most persistent，though not most seductive，in human nature．The view of London from Hungerford Bridge，grey，serious，massive，and full of the subdued stir of traffic and business，prosaic if it were not for the masts of the ships and the towers and domes of the city，brings him to mind．The tattered girls with violets in their hands at the street corners，and the old weather-beaten women patiently displaying their matches and bootlaces beneath the shelter of arches，seem like characters from his books．He is of the school of Crabbe and of Gissing，and not merely a fellow-pupil in the same stern place of learning，but its founder and master．





Jane Austen


It is probable that if Miss Cassandra Austen had had her way we should have had nothing of Jane Austen's except her novels．To her elder sister alone did she write freely；to her alone she confided her hopes and，if rumour is true，the one great disappointment of her life；but when Miss Cassandra Austen grew old，and the growth of her sister's fame made her suspect that a time might come when strangers would pry and scholars speculate，she burnt，at great cost to herself，every letter that could gratify their curiosity，and spared only what she judged too trivial to be of interest．

Hence our knowledge of Jane Austen is derived from a little gossip，a few letters，and her books．As for the gossip，gossip which has survived its day is never despicable；with a little rearrangement it suits our purpose admirably．For example，Jane“is not at all pretty and very prim，unlike a girl of twelve ... Jane is whimsical and affected，”says little Philadelphia Austen of her cousin．Then we have Mrs．Mitford，who knew the Austens as girls and thought Jane“the prettiest，silliest，most affected husband-hunting butterfly she ever remembers．”Next，there is Miss Mitford's anonymous friend“who visits her now［and］says that she has stiffened into the most perpendicular，precise，taciturn piece of ‘single blessedness’ that ever existed，and that，until Pride and Prejudice showed what a precious gem was hidden in that unbending case，she was no more regarded in society than a poker or firescreen ... The case is very different now”，the good lady goes on；“she is still a poker — but a poker of whom everybody is afraid ... A wit，a delineator of character，who does not talk is terrific indeed！”On the other side，of course，there are the Austens，a race little given to panegyric of themselves，but nevertheless，they say，her brothers“were very fond and very proud of her．They were attached to her by her talents，her virtues，and her engaging manners，and each loved afterwards to fancy a resemblance in some niece or daughter of his own to the dear sister Jane，whose perfect equal they yet never expected to see．”Charming but perpendicular，loved at home but feared by strangers，biting of tongue but tender of heart — these contrasts are by no means incompatible，and when we turn to the novels we shall find ourselves stumbling there too over the same complexities in the writer．

To begin with，that prim little girl whom Philadelphia found so unlike a child of twelve，whimsical and affected，was soon to be the authoress of an astonishing and unchildish story，Love and Freindship，which，incredible though it appears，was written at the age of fifteen．It was written，apparently，to amuse the schoolroom；one of the stories in the same book is dedicated with mock solemnity to her brother；another is neatly illustrated with water-colour heads by her sister．These are jokes which，one feels，were family property；thrusts of satire，which went home because all little Austens made mock in common of fine ladies who“sighed and fainted on the sofa”．

Brothers and sisters must have laughed when Jane read out loud her last hit at the vices which they all abhorred．“I die a martyr to my grief for the loss of Augustus．One fatal swoon has cost me my life．Beware of Swoons，Dear Laura ... Run mad as often as you chuse，but do not faint ...”And on she rushed，as fast as she could write and quicker than she could spell，to tell the incredible adventures of Laura and sophia，of Philander and Gustavus，of the gentleman who drove a coach between Edinburgh and Stirling every other day，of the theft of the fortune that was kept in the table drawer，of the starving mothers and the sons who acted Macbeth．Undoubtedly，the story must have roused the schoolroom to uproarious laughter．And yet，nothing is more obvious than that this girl of fifteen，sitting in her private corner of the common parlour，was writing not to draw a laugh from brother and sisters，and not for home consumption．She was writing for everybody，for nobody，for our age，for her own；in other words，even at that early age Jane Austen was writing．One hears it in the rhythm and shapeliness and severity of the sentences．“She was nothing more than a mere good-tempered，civil，and obliging young woman；as such we could scarcely dislike her — she was only an object of contempt．”Such a sentence is meant to outlast the Christmas holidays．Spirited，easy，full of fun，verging with freedom upon sheer nonsense，— Love and Freindship is all that；but what is this note which never merges in the rest，which sounds distinctly and penetratingly all through the volume？It is the sound of laughter．The girl of fifteen is laughing，in her corner，at the world．

Girls of fifteen are always laughing．They laugh when Mr．Binney helps himself to salt instead of sugar．They almost die of laughing when old Mrs．Tomkins sits down upon the cat．But they are crying the moment after．They have no fixed abode from which they see that there is something eternally laughable in human nature，some quality in men and women that for ever excites our satire．They do not know that Lady Greville who snubs，and poor Maria who is snubbed，are permanent features of every ballroom．But Jane Austen knew it from her birth upwards．One of those fairies who perch upon cradles must have taken her a flight through the world directly she was born．When she was laid in the cradle again she knew not only what the world looked like，but had already chosen her kingdom．She had agreed that if she might rule over that territory，she would covet no other．Thus at fifteen she had few illusions about other people and none about herself．Whatever she writes is finished and turned and set in its relation，not to the parsonage，but to the universe．She is impersonal；she is inscrutable．When the writer，Jane Austen，wrote down in the most remarkable sketch in the book a little of Lady Greville's conversation，there is no trace of anger at the snub which the clergyman's daughter，Jane Austen，once received．Her gaze passes straight to the mark，and we know precisely where，upon the map of human nature，that mark is．We know because Jane Austen kept to her compact；she never trespassed beyond her boundaries．Never，even at the emotional age of fifteen，did she round upon herself in shame，obliterate a sarcasm in a spasm of compassion，or blur an outline in a mist of rhapsody．Spasms and rhapsodies，she seems to have said，pointing with her stick，end there；and the boundary line is perfectly distinct．But she does not deny that moons and mountains and castles exist — on the other side．She has even one romance of her own．It is for the Queen of Scots．She really admired her very much．“One of the first characters in the world”，she called her，“a bewitching Princess whose only friend was then the Duke of Norfolk，and whose only ones now Mr．Whitaker，Mrs．Lefroy，Mrs．Knight and myself．”With these words her passion is neatly circumscribed，and rounded with a laugh．It is amusing to remember in what terms the young Brontës wrote，not very much later，in their northern parsonage，about the Duke of Wellington．

The prim little girl grew up．She became“the prettiest，silliest，most affected husband-hunting butterfly”Mrs．Mitford ever remembered，and，incidentally，the authoress of a novel called Pride and Prejudice，which，written stealthily under cover of a creaking door，lay for many years unpublished．A little later，it is thought，she began another story，The Watsons，and being for some reason dissatisfied with it，left it unfinished．The second-rate works of a great writer are worth reading because they offer the best criticism of his masterpieces．Here her difficulties are more apparent，and the method she took to overcome them less artfully concealed．To begin with，the stiffness and the bareness of the first chapters prove that she was one of those writers who lay their facts out rather baldly in the first version and then go back and back and back and cover them with flesh and atmosphere．How it would have been done we cannot say — by what suppressions and insertions and artful devices．But the miracle would have been accomplished；the dull history of fourteen years of family life would have been converted into another of those exquisite and apparently effortless introductions；and we should never have guessed what pages of preliminary drudgery Jane Austen forced her pen to go through．Here we perceive that she was no conjuror after all．Like other writers，she had to create the atmosphere in which her own peculiar genius could bear fruit．Here she fumbles；here she keeps us waiting．Suddenly she has done it；now things can happen as she likes things to happen．The Edwardses are going to the ball．The Tomlinsons' carriage is passing；she can tell us that Charles is“being provided with his gloves and told to keep them on”；Tom Musgrave retreats to a remote corner with a barrel of oysters and is famously snug．Her genius is freed and active．At once our senses quicken；we are possessed with the peculiar intensity which she alone can impart．But of what is it all composed？Of a ball in a country town；a few couples meeting and taking hands in an assembly room；a little eating and drinking；and for catastrophe，a boy being snubbed by one young lady and kindly treated by another．There is no tragedy and no heroism．Yet for some reason the little scene is moving out of all proportion to its surface solemnity．We have been made to see that if Emma acted so in the ball-room，how considerate，how tender，inspired by what sincerity of feeling she would have shown herself in those graver crises of life which，as we watch her，come inevitably before our eyes．Jane Austen is thus a mistress of much deeper emotion than appears upon the surface．She stimulates us to supply what is not there．What she offers is，apparently，a trifle，yet is composed of something that expands in the reader's mind and endows with the most enduring form of life scenes which are outwardly trivial．Always the stress is laid upon character．How，we are made to wonder，will Emma behave when Lord Osborne and Tom Musgrave make their call at five minutes before three，just as Mary is bringing in the tray and the knife-case？It is an extremely awkward situation．The young men are accustomed to much greater refinement．Emma may prove herself ill-bred，vulgar，a nonentity．The turns and twists of the dialogue keep us on the tenterhooks of suspense．Our attention is half upon the present moment，half upon the future．And when，in the end，Emma behaves in such a way as to vindicate our highest hopes of her，we are moved as if we had been made witnesses of a matter of the highest importance．Here，indeed，in this unfinished and in the main inferior story，are all the elements of Jane Austen's greatness．It has the permanent quality of literature．Think away the surface animation，the likeness to life，and there remains，to provide a deeper pleasure，an exquisite discrimination of human values．Dismiss this too from the mind and one can dwell with extreme satisfaction upon the more abstract art which，in the ballroom scene，so varies the emotions and proportions the parts that it is possible to enjoy it，as one enjoys poetry，for itself，and not as a link which carries the story this way and that．

But the gossip says of Jane Austen that she was perpendicular，precise，and taciturn —“a poker of whom everybody is afraid”．Of this too there are traces；she could be merciless enough；she is one of the most consistent satirists in the whole of literature．Those first angular chapters of The Watsons prove that hers was not a prolific genius；she had not，like Emily Brontë，merely to open the door to make herself felt．Humbly and gaily she collected the twigs and straws out of which the nest was to be made and placed them neatly together．The twigs and straws were a little dry and a little dusty in themselves．There was the big house and the little house；a tea party，a dinner party，and an occasional picnic；life was hedged in by valuable connections and adequate incomes；by muddy roads，wet feet，and a tendency on the part of the ladies to get tired；a little principle supported it，a little consequence，and the education commonly enjoyed by upper middle-class families living in the country．Vice，adventure，passion were left outside．But of all this prosiness，of all this littleness，she evades nothing，and nothing is slurred over．Patiently and precisely she tells us how they“made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury，where a comfortable meal，uniting dinner and supper，wound up the enjoyments and fatigues of the day”．Nor does she pay to conventions merely the tribute of lip homage；she believes in them besides accepting them．When she is describing a clergyman，like Edmund Bertram，or a sailor，in particular，she appears debarred by the sanctity of his office from the free use of her chief tool，the comic genius，and is apt therefore to lapse into decorous panegyric or matter-of-fact description．But these are exceptions；for the most part her attitude recalls the anonymous lady's ejaculation —“A wit，a delineator of character，who does not talk is terrific indeed！”She wishes neither to reform nor to annihilate；she is silent；and that is terrific indeed．One after another she creates her fools，her prigs，her worldlings，her Mr．Collinses，her Sir Walter Elliotts，her Mrs．Bennets．She encircles them with the lash of a whip-like phrase which，as it runs round them，cuts out their silhouettes for ever．But there they remain；no excuse is found for them and no mercy shown them．Nothing remains of Julia and Maria Bertram when she has done with them；Lady Bertram is left“sitting and calling to Pug and trying to keep him from the flower-beds”eternally．A divine justice is meted out；Dr．Grant，who begins by liking his goose tender，ends by bringing on“apoplexy and death，by three great institutionary dinners in one week”．sometimes it seems as if her creatures were born merely to give Jane Austen the supreme delight of slicing their heads off．She is satisfied；she is content；she would not alter a hair on anybody's head，or move one brick or one blade of grass in a world which provides her with such exquisite delight．

Nor，indeed，would we．For even if the pangs of outraged vanity，or the heat of moral wrath，urged us to improve away a world so full of spite，pettiness，and folly，the task is beyond our powers．People are like that — the girl of fifteen knew it；the mature woman proves it．At this very moment some Lady Bertram is trying to keep Pug from the flower beds；she sends Chapman to help Miss Fanny a little late．The discrimination is so perfect，the satire so just，that，consistent though it is，it almost escapes our notice．No touch of pettiness，no hint of spite，rouse us from our contemplation．Delight strangely mingles with our amusement．Beauty illumines these fools．

That elusive quality is，indeed，often made up of very different parts，which it needs a peculiar genius to bring together．The wit of Jane Austen has for partner the perfection of her taste．Her fool is a fool，her snob is a snob，because he departs from the model of sanity and sense which she has in mind，and conveys to us unmistakably even while she makes us laugh．Never did any novelist make more use of an impeccable sense of human values．It is against the disc of an unerring heart，an unfailing good taste，an almost stern morality，that she shows up those deviations from kindness，truth，and sincerity which are among the most delightful things in English literature．She depicts a Mary Crawford in her mixture of good and bad entirely by this means．She lets her rattle on against the clergy，or in favour of a baronetage and ten thousand a year，with all the ease and spirit possible；but now and again she strikes one note of her own，very quietly，but in perfect tune，and at once all Mary Crawford's chatter，though it continues to amuse，rings flat．Hence the depth，the beauty，the complexity of her scenes．From such contrasts there comes a beauty，a solemnity even，which are not only as remarkable as her wit，but an inseparable part of it．In The Watsons she gives us a foretaste of this power；she makes us wonder why an ordinary act of kindness，as she describes it，becomes so full of meaning．In her masterpieces，the same gift is brought to perfection．Here is nothing out of the way；it is midday in Northamptonshire；a dull young man is talking to rather a weakly young woman on the stairs as they go up to dress for dinner，with housemaids passing．But，from triviality，from commonplace，their words become suddenly full of meaning，and the moment for both one of the most memorable in their lives．It fills itself；it shines；it glows；it hangs before us，deep，trembling，serene for a second；next，the housemaid passes，and this drop，in which all the happiness of life has collected，gently subsides again to become part of the ebb and flow of ordinary existence．

What more natural，then，with this insight into their profundity，than that Jane Austen should have chosen to write of the trivialities of day-to-day existence，of parties，picnics，and country dances？No“suggestions to alter her style of writing”from the Prince Regent or Mr．Clarke could tempt her；no romance，no adventure，no politics or intrigue could hold a candle to life on a country-house staircase as she saw it．Indeed，the Prince Regent and his librarian had run their heads against a very formidable obstacle；they were trying to tamper with an incorruptible conscience，to disturb an infallible discretion．The child who formed her sentences so finely when she was fifteen never ceased to form them，and never wrote for the Prince Regent or his Librarian，but for the world at large．She knew exactly what her powers were，and what material they were fitted to deal with as material should be dealt with by a writer whose standard of finality was high．There were impressions that lay outside her province；emotions that by no stretch or artifice could be properly coated and covered by her own resources．For example，she could not make a girl talk enthusiastically of banners and chapels．She could not throw herself whole-heartedly into a romantic moment．She had all sorts of devices for evading scenes of passion．Nature and its beauties she approached in a sidelong way of her own．She describes a beautiful night without once mentioning the moon．Nevertheless，as we read the few formal phrases about“the brilliancy of an unclouded night and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods”，the night is at once as“solemn，and soothing，and lovely”as she tells us，quite simply，that it was．

The balance of her gifts was singularly perfect．Among her finished novels there are no failures，and among her many chapters few that sink markedly below the level of the others．But，after all，she died at the age of forty-two．She died at the height of her powers．She was still subject to those changes which often make the final period of a writer's career the most interesting of all．Vivacious，irrepressible，gifted with an invention of great vitality，there can be no doubt that she would have written more，had she lived，and it is tempting to consider whether she would not have written differently．The boundaries were marked；moons，mountains，and castles lay on the other side．But was she not sometimes tempted to trespass for a minute？Was she not beginning，in her own gay and brilliant manner，to contemplate a little voyage of discovery？

Let us take Persuasion，the last completed novel，and look by its light at the books she might have written had she lived．There is a peculiar beauty and a peculiar dullness in Persuasion．The dullness is that which so often marks the transition stage between two different periods．The writer is a little bored．She has grown too familiar with the ways of her world；she no longer notes them freshly．There is an asperity in her comedy which suggests that she has almost ceased to be amused by the vanities of a Sir Walter or the snobbery of a Miss Elliott．The satire is harsh，and the comedy crude．She is no longer so freshly aware of the amusements of daily life．Her mind is not altogether on her object．But，while we feel that Jane Austen has done this before，and done it better，we also feel that she is trying to do something which she has never yet attempted．There is a new element in Persuasion，the quality，perhaps，that made Dr．Whewell fire up and insist that it was“the most beautiful of her works”．She is beginning to discover that the world is larger，more mysterious，and more romantic than she had supposed．We feel it to be true of herself when she says of Anne：“She had been forced into prudence in her youth，she learned romance as she grew older — the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning”．She dwells frequently upon the beauty and the melancholy of nature，upon the autumn where she had been wont to dwell upon the spring．She talks of the“influence so sweet and so sad of autumnal months in the country”．She marks“the tawny leaves and withered hedges”．“One does not love a place the less because one has suffered in it”，she observes．But it is not only in a new sensibility to nature that we detect the change．Her attitude to life itself is altered．She is seeing it，for the greater part of the book，through the eyes of a woman who，unhappy herself，has a special sympathy for the happiness and unhappiness of others，which，until the very end，she is forced to comment upon in silence．Therefore the observation is less of facts and more of feelings than is usual．There is an expressed emotion in the scene at the concert and in the famous talk about woman's constancy which proves not merely the biographical fact that Jane Austen had loved，but the aesthetic fact that she was no longer afraid to say so．Experience，when it was of a serious kind，had to sink very deep，and to be thoroughly disinfected by the passage of time，before she allowed herself to deal with it in fiction．But now，in 1817，she was ready．Outwardly，too，in her circumstances，a change was imminent．Her fame had grown very slowly．“I doubt”，wrote Mr．Austen Leigh，“whether it would be possible to mention any other author of note whose personal obscurity was so complete．”Had she lived a few more years only，all that would have been altered．She would have stayed in London，dined out，lunched out，met famous people，made new friends，read，travelled，and carried back to the quiet country cottage a hoard of observations to feast upon at leisure．

And what effect would all this have had upon the six novels that Jane Austen did not write？She would not have written of crime，of passion，or of adventure．She would not have been rushed by the importunity of publishers or the flattery of friends into slovenliness or insincerity．But she would have known more．Her sense of security would have been shaken．Her comedy would have suffered．She would have trusted less（this is already perceptible in Persuasion）to dialogue and more to reflection to give us a knowledge of her characters．Those marvellous little speeches which sum up，in a few minutes' chatter，all that we need in order to know an Admiral Croft or a Mrs．Musgrove for ever，that shorthand，hit-or-miss method which contains chapters of analysis and psychology，would have become too crude to hold all that she now perceived of the complexity of human nature．She would have devised a method，clear and composed as ever，but deeper and more suggestive，for conveying not only what people say，but what they leave unsaid；not only what they are，but what life is．She would have stood farther away from her characters，and seen them more as a group，less as individuals．Her satire，while it played less incessantly，would have been more stringent and severe．She would have been the forerunner of Henry James and of Proust — but enough．Vain are these speculations：the most perfect artist among women，the writer whose books are immortal，died“just as she was beginning to feel confidence in her own success”．





Mary Wollstonecraft


Great wars are strangely intermittent in their effects．The French Revolution took some people and tore them asunder；others it passed over without disturbing a hair of their heads．Jane Austen，it is said，never mentioned it；Charles Lamb ignored it；Beau Brummell never gave the matter a thought．But to Wordsworth and to Godwin it was the dawn；unmistakably they saw

France standing on the top of golden hours，

And human nature seeming born again．

Thus it would be easy for a picturesque historian to lay side by side the most glaring contrasts — here in Chesterfield Street was Beau Brummell letting his chin fall carefully upon his cravat and discussing in a tone studiously free from vulgar emphasis the proper cut of the lapel of a coat£»and here in Somers Town was a party of ill-dressed，excited young men，one with a head too big for his body and a nose too long for his face，holding forth day by day over the tea-cups upon human perfectibility ，ideal unity，and the rights of man．There was also a woman present with very bright eyes and a very eager tongue，and the young men，who had middle-class names，like Barlow and Holcroft and Godwin，called her simply“Wollstonecraft”，as if it did not matter whether she were married or unmarried，as if she were a young man like themselves．

Such glaring discords among intelligent people for — Charles Lamb and Godwin，Jane Austen and Mary Wollstonecraft were all highly intelligent — suggest how much influence circumstances have upon opinions．If Godwin had been brought up in the precincts of the Temple and had drunk deep of antiquity and old letters at Christ's Hospital，he might never have cared a straw for the future of man and his rights in general．If Jane Austen had lain as a child on the landing to prevent her father from thrashing her mother．her soul might have burnt with such a passion against tyranny that all her novels might have been consumed in one cry for justice．

Such had been Mary Wollstonecraft's first experience of the joys of married life．And then her sister Everina had been married miserably and had bitten her wedding ring to pieces in the coach．Her brother had been a burden on her£»her father's farm had failed，and in order to start that disreputable man with the red face and the violent temper and the dirty hair in life again she had gone into bondage among the aristocracy as a governess — in short，she had never known what happiness was，and，in its default，had fabricated a creed fitted to meet the sordid misery of real human life．The staple of her doctrine was that nothing mattered save independence．“Every obligation we receive from our fellow-creatures is a new shackle，takes from our native freedom，and debases the mind．”Independence was the first necessity for a woman£»not grace or charm，but energy and courage and the power to put her will into effect．were her necessary qualities．It was her highest boast to be able to say，“I never yet resolved to do anything of consequence that l did not adhere readily to it”．Certainly Mary could say this with truth．When she was a little more than thirty she could look back upon a series of actions which she had carried out in the teeth of opposition．She had taken a house by prodigious efforts for her friend Fanny，only to find that Fanny's mind was changed and she did not want a house after all．She had started a school．She had persuaded Fanny into marrying Mr．Skeys．She had thrown up her school and gone to Lisbon alone to nurse Fanny when she died．On the voyage back she had forced the captain of the ship to rescue a wrecked French vessel by threatening to expose him if he refused．And when，overcome by a passion for Fuseli，she declared her wish to live with him and been refused flatly by his wife，she had put her principle of decisive action instantly into effect，and had gone to Paris determined to make her living by her pen．

The Revolution thus was not merely an event that had happened outside her；it was an active agent in her own blood．She had been in revolt all her life — against tyranny，against law，against convention．The reformer's love of humanity，which has so much of hatred in it as well as love，fermented within her．The outbreak of revolution in France expressed some of her deepest theories and convictions，and she dashed off in the heat of that extraordinary moment those two eloquent and daring books — the Reply to Burke and the Vindication of the Rights of Woman，which are so true that they seem now to contain nothing new in them — their originality has become our commonplace．But when she was in Paris lodginq by herself in a great house，and saw with her own eyes the King whom she despised driving past surrounded by National Guards and holding himself with greater dignity than she expected，then，“I can scarcely tell you why”，the tears came to her eyes．“I am going to bed，”the letter ended，“and，for the first time in my life，I cannot put out the candle．”Things were not so simple after all．She could not understand even her own feelings．She saw the most cherished of her convictions put into practice — and her eyes filled with tears．She had won fame and independence and the right to live her own life — and she wanted something different．“I do not want to be loved like a goddess，”she wrote，“but 1 wish to be necessary to you．”For Imlay，the fascinating American to whom her letter was addressed，had been very good to her．Indeed，she had fallen passionately in love with him．But it was one of her theories that love should be free —“that mutual affection was marriage and that the marriage tie should not bind after the death of love，if love should die”．And yet at the same time that she wanted freedom she wanted certainty．“I like the word affection，”she wrote，“because it signifies something habitual．”

The conflict of all these contradictions shows itself in her race，at once so resolute and so dreamy，so sensual and so intelligent，and beautiful into the bargain with its great coils of hair and the large bright eyes that Southey thought the most expressive he had ever seen．The life of such a woman was bound to be tempestuous．Every day she made theories by which Iife should be Iived；and every day she came smack against the rock of other people's prejudices．Every day too — for she was no pedant，no cold-blooded theorist — something was born in her that thrust aside her theories and forced her to model them afresh．She acted upon her theory that she had no legal claim upon lmlay；she refused to marry him；but when he left her alone week after week with the child she had borne him her agony was unendurable．

Thus distracted，thus puzzling even to herself，the plausible and treacherous lmlay cannot be altogether blamed for failing to follow the rapidity of her changes and the alternate reason and unreason of her moods．Even friends whose liking was impartial were disturbed by her discrepancies．Mary had a passionate，an exuberant，love of Nature，and yet one night when the colours in the sky were so exquisite that Madeleine Schweizer could not help saying to her，“Come，Mary — come，nature-lover and enjoy this wonderful spectacle — this constant transition from colour to colour”，Mary never took her eyes off the Baron de Wolzogen．“I must confess．”wrote Madame Schweizer，“that this erotic absorption made such a disagreeable impression on me，that all my pleasure vanished．”But if the sentimental Swiss was disconcerted by Mary's sensuality，lmlay，the shrewd man of business，was exasperated by her intelligence．Whenever he saw her he yielded to her charm，but then her quickness，her penetration，her uncompromising idealism harassed him．She saw through his excuses；she met all his reasons；she was even capable of managing his business．There was no peace with her — he must be off again．And then her letters followed him，torturing him with their sincerity and their insight．They were so outspoken；they pleaded so passionately to be told the truth；they showed such a contempt for soap and alum and wealth and comfort；they repeated，as he suspected，so truthfully that he had only to say the word，“and you shall never hear of me more”，that he could not endure it．Tickling minnows he had hooked a dolphin，and the creature rushed him through the waters till he was dizzy and only wanted to escape．After all，though he had played at theory-making too，he was a business man，he depended upon soap and alum；“the secondary pleasures of life”，he had to admit，“are very necessary to my comfort”．And among them was one that for ever evaded Mary's jealous scrutiny．Was it business，was it politics，was it a woman，that perpetually took him away from her？He shillied and shallied；he was very charming when they met；then he disappeared again．Exasperated at last，and half insane with suspicion，she forced the truth from the cook．A little actress in a strolling company was his mistress，she Iearnt．True to her own creed of decisive action，Mary at once soaked her skirts so that she might sink unfailingly，and threw herself from Putney Bridge．But she was rescued；after unspeakable agony she recovered，and then her“unconquerable greatness of mind”，her girlish creed of independence，asserted itself again，and she determined to make another bid for happiness and to earn her living without taking a penny from lmlay for herself or their child．

It was in this crisis that she again saw Godwin，the little man with the big head，whom she had met when the French Revolution was making the young men in Somers Town think that a new world was being born．She met him — but that is a euphemism，for in fact Mary Wollstonecraft actually visited him in his own house．Was it the effect of the French Revolution？Was it the blood she had seen spilt on the pavement and the cries of the furious crowd that had rung in her ears that made it seem a matter of no importance whether she put on her cloak and went to visit Godwin in Somers Town，or waited in Judd Street West for Godwin to come to her？And what strange upheaval of human life was it that inspired that curious man，who was so queer a mixture of meanness and magnanimity，of coldness and deep feeling — for the memoir of his wife could not have been written without unusual depth of heart — to hold the view that she did right — that he respected Mary for trampling upon the idiotic convention by which women's lives were tied down？He held the most extraordinary views on many subjects，and upon the relations of the sexes in particular．He thought that reason should influence even the love between men and women．He thought that there was something spiritual in their relationship．He had written that“marriage is a law，and the worst of all laws ... marriage is an affair of property，and the worst of all properties”．He held the belief that if two people of the opposite sex like each other，they should live together without any ceremony，or，for living together is apt to blunt love，twenty doors off，say，in the same street．And he went further；he said that if another man liked your wife“this will create no difficulty．We may all enjoy her conversation，and we shall all be wise enough to consider the sensual intercourse a very trivial object．”True，when hewrote those words he had never been in love；now for the first time he was to experience that sensation．It came very quietly and naturally，growing“with equal advances in the mind of each”from those talks in Somers Town，from those discussions upon everything under the sun which they held so improperly alone in his rooms．“It was friendship melting into love ...”，he wrote．“When，in the course of things，the disclosure came，there was nothing in a manner for either party to disclose to the other．”Certainly they were in agreement upon the most essential points；they were both of opinion，for instance，that marriage was unnecessary．They would continue to live apart．Only when Nature again intervened，and Mary found herself with child，was it worth while to lose valued friends，she asked．for the sake of a theory？She thought not，and they were married．And then that other theory — that it is best for husband and wife to live apart — was not that also incompatible with other feelings that were coming to birth in her？“A husband is a convenient part of the furniture of the house”，she wrote．Indeed，she discovered that she was passionately domestic．Why not，then，revise that theory too，and share the same roof．Godwin should have a room some doors off to work in；and they should dine out separately if they liked — their work，their friends，should be separate．Thus they settled it，and the plan worked admirably．The arrangement combined“the noveltyand lively sensation of a visit with the more delicious and heartfelt pleasures of domestic life”．Mary admitted that she was happy；Godwin confessed that，after all one's philosophy，it was“extremely gratifying”to find that“there is someone who takes an interest in one's happiness”．All sorts of powers and emotions were liberated in Mary by her new satisfaction．Trifles gave her an exquisite pleasure — the sight of Godwin and lmlay's child playing together；the thought of their own child who was to be born；a day's jaunt into the country．One day，meeting Imlay in the New Road，she greeted him without bitterness．But，as Godwin wrote，“Ours is not an idle happiness，a paradise of selfish and transitory pleasures”．No，it too was an experiment，as Mary's life had been an experiment from the start，an attempt to make human conventions conform more closely to human needs．And their marriage was only a beginning；all sorts of things were to follow after．Mary was going to have a child．She was going to write a book to be called The Wrongs of Women．She was going to reform education．She was going to come down to dinner the day after her child was born．She was going to employ a midwife and not a doctor at her confinement — but that experiment was her last．She died in child-birth．She whose sense of her own existence was so intense，who had cried out even in her misery，“I cannot bear to think of being no more — of losing myself — nay，it appears to me impossible that I should cease to exist”，died at the age of thirty-six．But she has her revenge．Many millions have died and been forgotten in the hundred and thirty years that have passed since she was buried；and yet as we read her letters and listen to her arguments and consider her experiments，above all，that most fruitful experiment，her relation with Godwin，and realise the high-handed and hot-hlooded manner in which she cut her way to the quick of life，one form of immortality is hers undoubtedly：she is alive and active，she argues and experiments，we hear her voice and trace her influence even now among the living．





Dorothy Wordsworth


Two highly incongruous travellers，Mary Wollstonecraft and Dorothy Wordsworth，followed close upon each other's footsteps．Mary was in Altona on the Elbe in 1795 with her baby；three years later Dorothy came there with her brother and Coleridge．Both kept a record of their travels，both saw the same places，but the eyes with which they saw them were very different．Whatever Mary saw served to start her mind upon some theory，upon the effect of government，upon the state of the people，upon the mystery of her own soul．The beat of the oars on the waves made her ask，“Life，what are you？Where goes this breath？This — I — so much alive？In what element will it mix，giving and receiving fresh energy？”Andsometimes she forgot to look at the sunset and looked instead at the Baron Wolzogen．Dorothy，on the other hand，noted what was before her accurately，literally，and with prosaic precision．“The walk very pleasing between Hamburgh and Altona．A large piece of ground planted with trees，and intersected by gravel walks ... The ground on the opposite side of the Elbe appears marshy．”Dorothy never railed against“the cloven hoof of despotism”．Dorothy never asked“men's questions”about exports and imports；Dorothy never confused her own soul with the sky．This“_I_ so much alive”was ruthlessly subordinated to the trees and the grass．For if she let“l”and its rights and its wrongs and its passions and its suffering get between her and the object，she would be calling the moon“the Queen Of the Night”；she would be talking of dawn's“orient beams”；she would be soaring into reveries and rhapsodies and forgetting to find the exact phrase for the ripple of moonlight upon the lake．It was like“herrings in the water”— she could not have said that if she had been thinking about herself．So while Mary dashed her head against wall after wall，and cried out，“Surely something resides in this heart that is not perishable — and life is more than a dream”，Dorothy went on methodically at Alfoxden noting the approach of spring．“The sloe in blossom，the hawthorn green，the larches in the park changed from black to green，in two or three days．”And next day，14th April 1798．“the evening very stormy，so we staid indoors．Mary Wollstonecraft's life，&c．，came．”And the day after they walked in the squire's grounds and noticed that“Nature was very successfully striving to make beautiful what art had deformed — ruins，hermitages，&c．，&c．”．There is no reference to Mary Wollstonecraft；it seems as if her life and all its storms had been swept away in one of those et ceteras，and yet the next sentence reads like an unconscious comment“Happily we cannot shape the huge hills，or carve out the valleys according to our fancy．”No，we cannot reform，we must not rebel；we can only accept and try to understand the message of Nature．And so the notes go on．

Spring passed；summer came；summer turned to autumn；it was winter，and then again the sloes were in blossom and the hawthorns green and spring had come．But it was spring in the North now，and Dorothy was living alone with her brother in a small cottage at Grasmere in the midst of the hills．Now after the hardships and separations of youth they were together under their own roof；now they could address themselves undisturbed to the absorbing occupation of living in the heart of Nature and trying，day by day，to read her meaning．They had money enough at last to let them live together without the need of earning a penny．No family duties or professional tasks distracted them．Dorothy could ramble all day on the hills and sit up talking to Coleridge all night without being scolded by her aunt for unwomanly behaviour．The hours were theirs from sunrise to sunset，and could be altered to suit the season．If it was fine，there was no need to come in；if it was wet，there was no need to get up．One could go to bed at any hour．One could let the dinner cool if the cuckoo were shouting on the hill and William had not found the exact epithet he wanted．Sunday was a day like any other．Custom，convention，everything was subordinated to the absorbing，exacting，exhausting task of living in the heart of Nature and writing poetry．For exhausting it was．William would make his head ache in the effort to find the right word．He would go on hammering at a poem until Dorothy was afraid to suggest an alteration．A chance phrase of hers would run in his head and make it impossible for him to get back into the proper mood．He would come down to breakfast and sit“with his shirt neck unbuttoned，and his waistcoat open”，writing a poem on a Butterfly which some story of hers had suggested，and he would eat nothing，and then he would begin altering the poem and again would be exhausted．

It is strange how vividly all this is brought before us，considering that the diary is made up of brief notes such as any quiet woman might make of her garden's changes and her brother's moods and the progress of the seasons．It was warm and mild，she notes，after a day of rain．She met a cow in a field．“The cow looked at me，and I looked at the cow，and whenever I stirred the cow gave over eating．”She met an old man who walked with two sticks — for days on end she met nothing more out of the way than a cow eating and an old man walking．And her motives for writing are common enough —“because I will not quarrel with myself，and because I shall give William pleasure by it when he comes home again”．It is only gradually that the difference between this rough notebook and others discloses itself；only by degrees that the brief notes unfurl in the mind and open a whole landscape before us，that the plain statement proves to be aimed so directly at the object that if we look exactly along the line that it points we shall see precisely what she saw．“The moonlight lay upon the hills like snow．”“The air was become still，the lake of a bright slate colour，the hills darkening．The bays shot into the low fading shores．Sheep resting．All things quiet．”“There was no one waterfall above another — it was the sound of waters in the air — the voice of the air．”Even in such brief notes one feels the suggestive power which is the gift of the poet rather than of the naturalist，the power which，taking only the simplest facts，so orders them that the whole scene comes before us，heightened and composed，the lake in its quiet，the hills in their splendour．Yet she was no descriptive writer in the usual sense．Her first concern was to be truthful — grace and symmetry must be made subordinate to truth．But then truth is sought because to falsify the look of the stir of the breeze on the lake is to tamper with the spirit which inspires appearances．It is that spirit which goads her and urges her and keeps her faculties for ever on the stretch．A sight or a sound would not let her be till she had traced her perception along its course and fixed it in words，though they might be bald，or in an image，though it might be angular．Nature was a stern taskmistress．The exact prosaic detail must be rendered as well as the vast and visionary outline．Even when the distant hills trembled before her in the glory of a dream she must note with literal accuracy“the glittering silver line on the ridge of the backs of the sheep”，or remark how“the crows at a little distance from us became white as silver as they flew in the sunshine，and when they went still further，they looked like shapes of water passing over the green fields”．Always trained and in use，her powers of observation became in time so expert and so acute that a day's walk stored her mind's eye with a vast assembly of curious objects to be sorted at leisure．How strange the sheep looked mixed with the soldiers at Dumbarton Castle！ For some reason the sheep looked their real size，but the soldiers looked like puppets．And then the movements of the sheep were so natural and fearless，and the motion of the dwarf soldiers was so restless and apparently without meaning．It was extremely queer．Or lying in bed she would look up at the ceiling and think how the varnished beams were“as glossy as black rocks on a sunny day cased in ice”．Yes，they crossed each other in almost as intricate and fantastic a manner as I have seen the underboughs of a large beech-tree withered by the depth of the shade above ... It was like what I should suppose an underground cave or temple to be，with a dripping or moist roof，and the moonlight entering in upon it by some means or other，and yet the colours were more like melted gems．I lay looking up till the light of the fire faded away ... I did not sleep much．

Indeed，she scarcely seemed to shut her eyes．They looked and they looked，urged on not only by an indefatigable curiosity but also by reverence，as if some secret of the utmost importance lay hidden beneath the surface．Her pen sometimes stammers with the intensity of the emotion that she controlled，as De Quincey said that her tongue stammered with the conflict between her ardour and her shyness when she spoke．But controlled she was．Emotional and impulsive by nature，her eyes“wild and starting”，tormented by feelings which almost mastered her，still she must control，still she must repress，or she would fail in her task — she would cease to see．But if one subdued oneself，and resigned one's private agitations，then，as if in reward，Nature would bestow an exquisite satisfaction．“Rydale was very beautiful，with spear-shaped streaks of polished steel ... lt calls home the heart to quietness．I had been very melancholy”，she wrote．For did not Coleridge come walking over the hills and tap at the cottage door late at night — did she not carry a letter from Coleridge hidden safe in her bosom？

Thus giving to Nature，thus receiving from Nature，it seemed，as the arduous and ascetic days went by，that Nature and Dorothy had grown together in perfect sympathy — a sympathy not cold or vegetable or inhuman because at the core of it burnt that other love for“my beloved”，her brother，who was indeed its heart and inspiration．William and Nature and Dorothy herself，were they not one being？Did they not compose a trinity，self-contained and self-sufficient and independent whether indoors or out？They sit indoors．It was

about ten o'clock and a quiet night．The fire flickers and the watch ticks．I hear nothing but the breathing of my Beloved as he now and then pushes his book forward，and turns over a leaf．

And now it is an April day，and they take the old cloak and lie in John's grove out of doors together．

William heard me breathing，and rustling now and then，but we both lay still and unseen by one another．He thought that it would be sweet thus to lie in the grave，to hear the peaceful sounds of the earth，and just to know that our dear friends were near．The lake was still；there was a boat out．

It was a strange love，profound，almost dumb，as if brother and sister had grown together and shared not the speech but the mood，so that they hardly knew which felt，which spoke，which saw the daffodils or the sleeping city；only Dorothy stored the mood in prose，and later William came and bathed in it and made it into poetry．But one could not act without the other．They must feel，they must think，they must be together．So now，when they had lain out on the hill-side they would rise and go home and make tea，and Dorothy would write to Coleridge，and they would sow the scarlet beans together，and William would work at his“Leech Gatherer”，and Dorothy would copy the lines for him．Rapt but controlled，free yet strictly ordered，the homely narrative moves naturally from ecstasy on the hills to baking bread and ironing linen and fetching William his supper in the cottage．

The cottage，though its garden ran up into the fells，was on the highroad．Through her parlour window Dorothy looked out and saw whoever might be passing — a tall beggar woman perhaps with her baby on her back；an old soldier；a coroneted landau with touring ladies peering inquisitively inside．The rich and the great she would let pass — they interested her no more than cathedrals or picture galleries or great cities；but she could never see a beggar at the door without asking him in and questioning him closely．Where had he been？What had he seen？How many children had he？She searched into the lives of the poor as if they held in them the same secret as the hills．A tramp eating cold bacon over the kitchen fire might have been a starry night，so closely she watched him；so clearly she noted how his old coat was patched“with three bell-shaped patches of darker blue behind，where the buttons had been”，how his beard of a fortnight's growth was like“grey plush”．And then as they rambled on with their tales of seafaring and the press-gang and the Marquis of Granby，she never failed to capture the one phrase that sounds on in the mind after the story is forgotten，“What，you are stepping westward？”“To be sure there is great promise for virgins in Heaven．”“She could trip lightly by the graves of those who died when they were young．”The poor had their poetry as the hills had theirs．But it was out of doors，on the road or on the moor，not in the cottage parlour，that her imagination had freest play．Her happiest moments were passed tramping beside a jibbing horse on a wet Scottish road without certainty of bed or supper．All she knew was that there was some sight ahead，some grove of trees to be noted，some waterfall to be inquired into．On they tramped hour after hour in silence for the most part，though Coleridge，who was of the party，would suddenly begin to debate aloud the true meaning of the words majestic，sublime，and grand．They had to trudge on foot because the horse had thrown the cart over a bank and the harness was only mended with string and pocket-handkerchiefs．They were hungry，too，because Wordsworth had dropped the chicken and the bread into the lake，and they had nothing else for dinner．They were uncertain of the way，and did not know where they would find lodging：all they knew was that there was a waterfall ahead．At last Coleridge could stand it no longer．He had rheumatism in the joints；the lrish jaunting car provided no shelter from the weather；his companions were silent and absorbed．He Ieft them．But William and Dorothy tramped on．They looked Iike tramps themselves．Dorothy's cheeks were brown as a gipsy's，her clothes were shabby，her gait was rapid and ungainly．But still she was indefatigable；her eye never failed her；she noticed everything．At last they reached the waterfall．And then all Dorothy's powers fell upon it．She searched out its character，she noted its resemblances，she defined its differences，with all the ardour of a discoverer，with alI the exactness of a naturalist．with all the rapture of a lover．She possessed it at last — she had laid it up in her mind for ever．It had become one of those“inner visions”which she could call to mind at any time in their distinctness and in their particularity．It would come back to her long years afterwards when she was old and her mind had failed her；it would come back stilled and heightened and mixed with all the happiest memories of her past — with the thought of Racedown and Alfoxden and Coleridge reading“Christabel”，and her beloved，her brother William．It would bring with it what no human being could give，what no human relation could offer — consolation and quiet．If，then，the passionate cry of Mary Wollstonecraft had reached her ears —“Surely something resides in this heart that is not perishable — and“life is more than a dream”— she would have had no doubt whatever as to her answer．She would have said quite simply，“We looked about us，and felt that we were happy”．





Geraldine and Jane


Geraldine Jewsbury would certainly not have expected anybody at this time of day to bother themselves about her novels．If she had caught one pulling them down from the shelf in some library she would have expostulated．“They're such nonsense，my dear”，she would have said．And then one likes to fancy that she would have burst out in that irresponsible，unconventional way of hers against libraries and literature and love and life and all the rest of it with a“Damn it all！”or a“Confound it！”for Geraldine was fond of swearing．

The odd thing about Geraldine Jewsbury，indeed，was the way in which she combined oaths and endearments，sense and effervescence，daring and gush：“... defenceless and tender on the one hand，and strong enough to cleave the very rocks on the other”— that is how Mrs．Ireland，her biographer，puts it；or again：“Intellectually she was a man，but the heart within her was as womanly as ever daughter of Eve could boast”．Even to look at there was，it would seem，something incongruous，queer，provocative about her．She was very small and yet boyish；very ugly yet attractive．She dressed very well，wore her reddish hair in a net，and ear-rings made in the form of miniature parrots swung in her ears as she talked．There，in the only portrait we have of her，she sits reading，with her face half-turned away，defenceless and tender at the moment rather than cleaving the very rocks．

But what had happened to her before she sat at the photographer's table reading her book it is impossible to say．Until she was twenty-nine we know nothing of her except that she was born in the year 1812，was the daughter of a merchant，and lived in Manchester，or near it．In the first part of the nineteenth century a woman of twenty-nine was no longer young；she had lived her life or she had missed it．And though Geraldine，with her unconventional ways，was an exception，still it cannot be doubted that something very tremendous had happened in those dim years before we know her．something had happened in Manchester．An obscure male figure looms in the background — a faithless but fascinating creature who had taught her that life is treacherous，life is hard，life is the very devil for a woman．A dark pool of experience had formed in the back of her mind into which she would dip for the consolation or for the instruction of others．“Oh！ It is too frightful to talk about．For two years I lived only in short respites from this blackness of darkness”，she exclaimed from time to time．There had been seasons“like dreary，calm November days when there is but one cloud，but that one covers the whole heaven”．She had struggled，“but struggling is no use”．She had read Cudworth through．She had written an essay upon materialism before giving way．For，though the prey to so many emotions，she was also oddly detached and speculative．She liked to puzzle her head with questions about“matter and spirit and the nature of life”even while her heart was bleeding．Upstairs there was a box full of extracts，abstracts，and conclusions．Yet what conclusion could a woman come to？Did anything avail a woman when love had deserted her，when her lover had played her false？No．It was useless to struggle；one had better let the wave engulf one，the cloud close over one's head．so she meditated，lying often on a sofa with a piece of knitting in her hands and a green shade over her eyes．For she suffered from a variety of ailments — sore eyes，colds，nameless exhaustion；and Greenheys，the suburb outside Manchester，where she kept house for her brother，was very damp．“Dirty，half-melted snow and fog，a swampy meadow，set off by a creeping cold damp”— that was the view from her window．Often she could hardly drag herself across the room．And then there were incessant interruptions：somebody had come unexpectedly for dinner；she had to jump up and run into the kitchen and cook a fowl with her own hands．That done，she would put on her green shade and peer at her book again，for she was a great reader．She read metaphysics，she read travels，she read old books and new books — and especially the wonderful books of Mr．Carlyle．

Early in the year 1841 she came to London and secured an introduction to the great man whose works she so much admired．She met Mrs．Carlyle．They must have become intimate with great rapidity．In a few weeks Mrs．Carlyle was“dearest Jane”．They must have discussed everything．They must have talked about life and the past and the present，and certain“individuals”who were sentimentally interested or were not sentimentally interested in Geraldine．Mrs．Carlyle，so metropolitan，so brilliant，so deeply versed in life and scornful of its humbugs，must have captivated the young woman from Manchester completely，for directly Geraldine returned to Manchester she began writing long letters to Jane which echo and continue the intimate conversations of Cheyne Row．“A man who has had le plus grand succès among women，and who was the most passionate and poetically refined lover in his manners and conversation you would wish to find，once said to me ...”so she would begin．or she would reflect：

It may be that we women are made as we are in order that they may in some sort fertilise the world．We shall go on loving，they [the men] will go on struggling and toiling，and we are all alike mercifully allowed to die — after a while．I don't know whether you will agree to this，and I cannot see to argue，for my eyes are very bad and painful．

Probably Jane agreed to very little of all this．For Jane was eleven years the elder．Jane was not given to abstract reflections upon the nature of life．Jane was the most caustic，the most concrete，the most clear-sighted of women．But it is perhaps worth noting that when she first fell in with Geraldine she was beginning to feel those premonitions of jealousy，that uneasy sense that old relationships had shifted and that new ones were forming themselves，which had come to pass with the establishment of her husband's fame．No doubt，in the course of those long talks in Cheyne Row，Geraldine had received certain confidences，heard certain complaints，and drawn certain conclusions．For besides being a mass of emotion and sensibility，Geraldine was a clever，witty woman who thought for herself and hated what she called“respectability”as much as Mrs．Carlyle hated what she called“humbug”．In addition，Geraldine had from the first the strangest feelings about Mrs．Carlyle．She felt“vague undefined yearnings to be yours in some way”．“You will let me be yours and think of me as such，will you not？”she urged again and again．“I think of you as Catholics think of their saints”，she said：“... you will laugh，but I feel towards you much more like a lover than a female friend！”No doubt Mrs．Carlyle did laugh，but also she could scarcely fail to be touched by the little creature's adoration．

Thus when Carlyle himself early in 1843 suggested unexpectedly that they should ask Geraldine to stay with them，Mrs．Carlyle，after debating the question with her usual candour，agreed．She reflected that a little of Geraldine would be“very enlivening”，but，on the other hand，much of Geraldine would be very exhausting．Geraldine dropped hot tears on to one's hands；she watched one；she fussed one；she was always in a state of emotion．Then“with all her good and great qualities”Geraldine had in her“a born spirit of intrigue”which might make mischief between husband and wife，though not in the usual way，for，Mrs．Carlyle reflected，her husband“had the habit”of preferring her to other women，“and habits are much stronger in him than passions”．On the other hand，she herself was getting lazy intellectually；Geraldine loved talk and clever talk；with all her aspirations and enthusiasms it would be a kindness to let the young woman marooned in Manchester come to Chelsea；and so she came．

She came on the 1st or 2nd of February，and she stayed till the Saturday，the 11th of March．Such were visits in the year 1843．And the house was very small，and the servant was inefficient．Geraldine was always there．All the morning she scribbled Letters．All the afternoon she lay fast asleep on the sofa in the drawing-room．She dressed herself in a low-necked dress to receive visitors on Sunday．She talked too much．As for her reputed intellect，“she is sharp as a meat axe，but as narrow”．She flattered．She wheedled．She was insincere．She flirted．She swore．Nothing would make her go．The charges against her rose in a crescendo of irritation．Mrs．Carlyle almost had to turn her out of the house．At last they parted；and Geraldine，as she got into the cab，was in floods of tears，but Mrs．Carlyle's eyes were dry．Indeed，she was immensely relieved to see the last of her visitor．Yet when Geraldine had driven off and she found herself alone she was not altogether easy in her mind．She knew that her behaviour to a guest whom she herself had invited had been far from perfect．She had been“cold，cross，ironical，disobliging”．Above all，she was angry with herself for having taken Geraldine for a confidante．“Heaven grant that the consequences may be only BORING — not FATAL”，she wrote．But it is clear that she was very much out of temper；and with herself as much as with Geraldine．

Geraldine，returned to Manchester，was well aware that something was wrong．Estrangement and silence fell between them．People repeated malicious stories which she half believed．But Geraldine was the least vindictive of women —“very noble in her quarrels”，as Mrs．Carlyle herself admitted — and，if foolish and sentimental，neither conceited nor proud．Above all，her love for Jane was sincere．soon she was writing to Mrs．Carlyle again“with an assiduity and disinterestedness that verge on the superhuman”，as Jane commented with a little exasperation．She was worrying about Jane's health and saying that she did not want witty Letters，but only dull Letters telling the truth about Jane's state．For — it may have been one of those things that made her so trying as a visitor — Geraldine had not stayed for four weeks in Cheyne Row without coming to conclusions which it is not likely that she kept entirely to herself．“You have no one who has any sort of consideration for you”，she wrote．“You have had patience and endurance till I am sick of the virtues，and what have they done for you？Half-killed you．”“Carlyle”，she burst out，“is much too grand for everyday life．A sphinx does not fit in comfortably to our parlour life arrangements．”But she could do nothing．“The more one loves，the more helpless one feels”，she moralised．She could only watch from Manchester the bright kaleidoscope of her friend's existence and compare it with her own prosaic life，all made up of little odds and ends；but somehow，obscure though her own life was，she no longer envied Jane the brilliance of her lot．

So they might have gone on corresponding in a desultory way at a distance — and“I am tired to death of writing Letters into space”，Geraldine exclaimed；“one only writes after a long separation，to oneself，instead of one's friend”— had it not been for the Mudies．The Mudies and Mudieism as Geraldine called it，played a vast，if almost unrecorded，part in the obscure lives of Victorian gentlewomen．In this case the Mudies were two girls，Elizabeth and Juliet：“flary，staring，and conceited，stolid-looking girls”，Carlyle called them，the daughters of a Dundee schoolmaster，a respectable man who had written books on natural history and died，leaving a foolish widow and little or no provision for his family．somehow the Mudies arrived in Cheyne Row inconveniently，if one may hazard a guess，just as dinner was on the table．But the Victorian lady never minded that — she put herself to any inconvenience to help the Mudies．The question at once presented itself to Mrs．Carlyle，what could be done for them？Who knew of a place？who had influence with a rich man？Geraldine flashed into her mind．Geraldine was always wishing she could be of use．Geraldine might fairly be asked if there were situations to be had for the Mudies in Manchester．Geraldine acted with a promptitude that was much to her credit．She“placed”Juliet at once．soon she had heard of another place for Elizabeth．Mrs．Carlyle，who was in the Isle of Wight，at once procured stays，gown，and petticoat for Elizabeth，came up to London，took Elizabeth all the way across London to Euston Square at half past seven in the evening，put her in charge of a benevolent-looking，fat old man，saw that a letter to Geraldine was pinned to her stays，and returned home，exhausted，triumphant，yet，as happens often with the devotees of Mudieism，a prey to secret misgivings．Would the Mudies be happy？Would they thank her for what she had done？A few days later the inevitable bugs appeared in Cheyne Row，and were ascribed，with or without reason，to Elizabeth's shawl．What was far worse，Elizabeth herself appeared four months later，having proved herself“wholly inapplicable to any practical purpose”，having“sewed a BLACK apron with WHITE thread”，and，on being mildly scolded，having“thrown herself on the kitchen floor and kicked and screamed”．“Of course，her immediate dismissal is the result．”Elizabeth vanished — to sew more black aprons with white thread，to kick and scream and be dismissed — who knows what happened eventually to poor Elizabeth Mudie？She disappears from the world altogether，swallowed up in the dark shades of her sisterhood．Juliet，however，remained．Geraldine made Juliet her charge．She superintended and advised．The first place was unsatisfactory．Geraldine engaged herself to find another．She went off and sat in the hall of a“very stiff old lady”who wanted a maid．The very stiff old lady said she would want Juliet to clear-starch collars，to iron cuffs，and to wash and iron petticoats．Juliet's heart failed her．All this clear-starching and ironing，she exclaimed，were beyond her．Off went Geraldine again，late in the evening，and saw the old lady's daughter．It was arranged that the petticoats should be“put out”and only the collars and frills left for Juliet to iron．Off went Geraldine and arranged with her own milliner to give her lessons in quilling and trimming．And Mrs．Carlyle wrote kindly to Juliet and sent her a packet．so it went on with more places and more bothers，and more old ladies，and more interviews till Juliet wrote a novel，which a gentleman praised very highly，and Juliet told Miss Jewsbury that she was annoyed by another gentleman who followed her home from church；but still she was a very nice girl，and everybody spoke well of her until the year 1849，when suddenly，without any reason given，silence descends upon the last of the Mudies．It covers，one cannot doubt，another failure．The novel，the stiff old lady，the gentleman，the caps，the petticoats，the clear-starching — what was the cause of her downfall？Nothing is known．“The wretched stalking blockheads”，wrote Carlyle，“stalked fatefully，in spite of all that could be done and said，steadily downwards towards perdition and sank altogether out of view．”For all her endeavours Mrs．Carlyle had to admit that Mudieism was always a failure．

But Mudieism had unexpected results．Mudieism brought Jane and Geraldine together again．Jane could not deny that“the fluff of feathers”whom she had served up，as her way was，in so many a scornful phrase for Carlyle's amusement，had“taken up the matter with an enthusiasm even surpassing my own”．She had grit in her as well as fluff．Thus when Geraldine sent her the manuscript of her first novel，Zoe，Mrs．Carlyle bestirred herself to find a publisher（“for”，she wrote，“what is to become of her when she is old without ties，without purposes？”）and with surprising success．Chapman & Hall at once agreed to publish the book，which，their reader reported，“had taken hold of him with a grasp of iron”．The book had been long on the way．Mrs．Carlyle herself had been consulted at various stages of its career．She had read the first sketch“with a feeling little short of terror！ so much power of genius rushing so recklessly into unknown space．”But she had also been deeply impressed．

Geraldine in particular shows herself here a far more profound and daring speculator than ever I had fancied her．I do not believe there is a woman alive at the present day，not even Georges Sand herself，that could have written some of the best passages in this book ... but they must not publish it — decency forbids！

There was，Mrs．Carlyle complained，an indecency or“want of reserve in the spiritual department”，which no respectable public would stand．Presumably Geraldine consented to make alterations，though she confessed that she“had no vocation for propriety as such”；the book was rewritten，and it appeared at last in February 1845．The usual buzz and conflict of opinion at once arose．some were enthusiastic，others were shocked．The“old and young roués of the Reform Club almost go off into hysterics over — its INDECENCY”．The publisher was a little alarmed；but the scandal helped the sale，and Geraldine became a lioness．

And now，of course，as one turns the pages of the three little yellowish volumes，one wonders what reason there was for approval or disapproval，what spasm of indignation or admiration scored that pencil mark，what mysterious emotion pressed violets，now black as ink，between the pages of the love scenes．Chapter after chapter glides amiably，fluently past．In a kind of haze we catch glimpses of an illegitimate girl called Zoe；of an enigmatic Roman Catholic priest called Everhard；of a castle in the country；of ladies lying on sky-blue sofas；of gentlemen reading aloud；of girls embroidering hearts in silk．There is a conflagration．There is an embrace in a wood．There is incessant conversation．There is a moment of terrific emotion when the priest exclaims，“Would that I had never been born！”and proceeds to sweep a letter from the Pope asking him to edit a translation of the principal works of the Fathers of the first four centuries and a parcel containing a gold chain from the University of Göttingen into a drawer because Zoe has shaken his faith．But what indecency there was pungent enough to shock the roués of the Reform Club，what genius there was brilliant enough to impress the shrewd intellect of Mrs．Carlyle，it is impossible to guess．Colours that were fresh as roses eighty years ago have faded to a feeble pink；nothing remains of all those scents and savours but a faint perfume of faded violets，of stale hair-oil，we know not which．What miracles，we exclaim，are within the power of a few years to accomplish！ But even as we exclaim，we see，far away，a trace perhaps of what they meant．The passion，in so far as it issues from the lips of living people，is completely spent．The Zoes，the Clothildes，the Everhards moulder on their perches；but，nevertheless，there is somebody in the room with them；an irresponsible spirit，a daring and agile woman，if one considers that she is cumbered with crinoline and stays；an absurd sentimental creature，languishing，expatiating，but for all that still strangely alive．We catch a sentence now and then rapped out boldly，a thought subtly conceived．“How much better to do right without religion！”“Oh！ If they really believed all they preach，how would any priest or preacher be able to sleep in his bed！”“Weakness is the only state for which there is no hope．”“To love rightly is the highest morality of which mankind is capable．”Then how she hated the“compacted，plausible theories of men”！ And what is life？For what end was it given us？Such questions，such convictions，still hurtle past the heads of the stuffed figures mouldering on their perches．They are dead，but Geraldine Jewsbury herself still survives，independent，courageous，absurd，writing page after page without stopping to correct，and coming out with her views upon love，morality，religion，and the relations of the sexes，whoever may be within hearing，with a cigar between her lips．

Some time before the publication of Zoe，Mrs．Carlyle had forgotten，or overcome，her irritation with Geraldine，partly because she had worked so zealously in the cause of the Mudies，partly also because by Geraldine's painstaking she was“almost over-persuaded back into my old illusion that she has some sort of strange，passionate ... incomprehensible ATTRACTION towards me”．Not only was she drawn back into correspondence — after all her vows to the contrary she again stayed under the same roof with Geraldine，at Seaforth House near Liverpool，in July 1844．Not many days had passed before Mrs．Carlyle's“illusion”about the strength of Geraldine's affection for her proved to be no illusion but a monstrous fact．One morning there was some slight tiff between them：Geraldine sulked all day；at night Geraldine came to Mrs．Carlyle's bedroom and made a scene which was“a revelation to me，not only of Geraldine，but of human nature！ Such mad，lover-like jealousy on the part of one woman towards another it had never entered into my heart to conceive．”Mrs．Carlyle was angry and outraged and contemptuous．She saved up a full account of the scene to entertain her husband with．A few days later she turned upon Geraldine in public and sent the whole company into fits of laughter by saying，“I wondered she should expect me to behave decently to her after she had for a whole evening been making love before my very face to ANOTHER MAN！”The trouncing must have been severe，the humiliation painful．But Geraldine was incorrigible．A year later she was again sulking and raging and declaring that she had a right to rage because“she loves me better than all the rest of the world”；and Mrs．Carlyle was getting up and saying，“Geraldine，until you can behave like a gentlewoman ...”and leaving the room．And again there were tears and apologies and promises to reform．

Yet though Mrs．Carlyle scolded and jeered，though they were estranged，and though for a time they ceased to write to each other，still they always came together again．Geraldine，it is abundantly clear，felt that Jane was in every way wiser，better，stronger than she was．She depended on Jane．She needed Jane to keep her out of scrapes；for Jane never got into scrapes herself．But though Jane was so much wiser and cleverer than Geraldine，there were times when the foolish and irresponsible one of the two became the counsellor．Why，she asked，waste your time in mending old clothes？Why not work at something that will really employ your energies？Write，she advised her．For Jane，who was so profound，so far-seeing，could，Geraldine was convinced，write something that would help women in“their very complicated duties and difficulties”．She owed a duty to her sex．But，the bold woman proceeded，“do not go to Mr．Carlyle for sympathy，do not let him dash you with cold water．You must respect your own work，and your own motives”— a piece of advice that Jane，who was afraid to accept the dedication of Geraldine's new novel The Half Sisters，lest Mr．Carlyle might object，would have done well to follow．The little creature was in some ways the bolder and the more independent of the two．

She had，moreover，a quality that Jane with all her brilliancy lacked — an element of poetry，a trace of the speculative imagination．She browsed upon old books and copied out romantic passages about the palm trees and cinnamon of Arabia and sent them to lie，incongruously enough，upon the breakfast table in Cheyne Row．Jane's genius，of course，was the very opposite；it was positive，direct，and practical．Her imagination concentrated itself upon people．Her Letters owe their incomparable brilliancy to the hawk-like swoop and descent of her mind upon facts．Nothing escapes her．She sees through clear water down to the rocks at the bottom．But the intangible eluded her；she dismissed the poetry of Keats with a sneer；something of the narrowness and something of the prudery of a Scottish country doctors daughter clung to her．Though infinitely the less masterly，Geraldine was sometimes the broader minded．

Such sympathies and antipathies bound the two women together with an elasticity that made for permanence．The tie between them could stretch and stretch indefinitely without breaking．Jane knew the extent of Geraldine's folly；Geraldine had felt the full lash of Jane's tongue．They had learnt to tolerate each other．Naturally，they quarrelled again；but their quarrels were different now；they were quarrels that were bound to be made up．And when after her brother's marriage in 1854 Geraldine moved to London，it was to be near Mrs．Carlyle at Mrs．Carlyle's own wish．The woman who in 1843 would never be a friend of hers again was now the most intimate friend she had in the world．She was to lodge two streets off；and perhaps two streets off was the right space to put between them．The emotional friendship was full of misunderstandings at a distance；it was intolerably exacting under the same roof．But when they lived round the corner their relationship broadened and simplified；it became a natural intercourse whose ruffles and whose calms were based upon the depths of intimacy．They went about together．They went to hear The Messiah；and，characteristically，Geraldine wept at the beauty of the music and Jane had much ado to prevent herself from shaking Geraldine for crying and from crying herself at the ugliness of the chorus women．They went to Norwood for a jaunt，and Geraldine left a silk handkerchief and an aluminium brooch（“a love token from Mr．Barlow”）in the hotel and a new silk parasol in the waiting-room．Also Jane noted with sardonic satisfaction that Geraldine，in an attempt at economy，bought two second-class tickets，while the cost of a return ticket first class was precisely the same．

Meanwhile Geraldine lay on the floor and generalised and speculated and tried to formulate some theory of life from her own tumultuous experience．“How loathsome”（her language was always apt to be strong — she knew that she“sinned against Jane's notions of good taste”very often），how loathsome the position of women was in many ways！ How she herself had been crippled and stunted！ How her blood boiled in her at the power that men had over women！ She would like to kick certain gentlemen —“the lying hypocritical beggars！ Well，it's no good swearing — only，I am angry and it eases my mind．”

And then her thoughts turned to Jane and herself and to the brilliant gifts — at any rate，Jane had brilliant gifts — which had borne so little visible result．Nevertheless，except when she was ill，

I do not think that either you or I are to be called failures．We are indications of a development of womanhood which as yet is not recognised．It has，so far，no ready-made channels to run in，but still we have looked and tried，and found that the present rules for women will not hold us — that something better and stronger is needed .... There are women to come after us，who will approach nearer the fullness of the measure of the stature of a woman's nature．I regard myself as a mere faint indication，a rudiment of the idea，of certain higher qualities and possibilities that lie in women，and all the eccentricities and mistakes and miseries and absurdities I have made are only the consequences of an imperfect formation，an immature growth．

So she theorised，so she speculated；and Mrs．Carlyle listened，and laughed，and contradicted，no doubt，but with more of sympathy than of derision：she could have wished that Geraldine were more precise；she could have wished her to moderate her language．Carlyle might come in at any moment；and if there was one creature that Carlyle hated，it was a strong-minded woman of the George Sand species．Yet she could not deny that there was an element of truth in what Geraldine said；she had always thought that Geraldine“was born to spoil a horn or make a spoon”．Geraldine was no fool in spite of appearances．

But what Geraldine thought and said；how she spent her mornings；what she did in the long evenings of the London winter — all，in fact，that constituted her life at Markham Square — is but slightly and doubtfully known to us．For，fittingly enough，the bright light of Jane extinguished the paler and more flickering fire of Geraldine．She had no need to write to Jane any more．She was in and out of the house — now writing a letter for Jane because Jane's fingers were swollen，now taking a letter to the post and forgetting，like the scatter-brained romantic creature she was，to post it．A crooning domestic sound like the purring of a kitten or the humming of a tea-kettle seems to rise，as we turn the pages of Mrs．Carlyle's Letters，from the intercourse of the two incompatible but deeply attached women．so the years passed．At length，on Saturday，21st April 1866，Geraldine was to help Jane with a tea-party．Mr．Carlyle was in Scotland，and Mrs．Carlyle hoped to get through some necessary civilities to admirers in his absence．Geraldine was actually dressing for the occasion when Mr．Froude appeared suddenly at her house．He had just had a message from Cheyne Row to say that“something had happened to Mrs．Carlyle”．Geraldine flung on her cloak．They hastened together to St．George's Hospital．There，writes Froude，they saw Mrs．Carlyle，beautifully dressed as usual，

as if she had sat upon the bed after leaving the brougham，and had fallen back upon it asleep .... The brilliant mockery，the sad softness with which the mockery alternated，both were alike gone．The features lay composed in a stern majestic calm .... [Geraldine] could not speak．

Nor indeed can we break that silence．It deepened．It became complete．soon after Jane's death she went to live at Sevenoaks．She lived there alone for twenty-two years．It is said that she lost her vivacity．She wrote no more books．Cancer attacked her and she suffered much．On her deathbed she began tearing up Jane's Letters，as Jane had wished，and she had destroyed all but one before she died．Thus，just as her life began in obscurity，so it ended in obscurity．We know her well only for a few years in the middle．But let us not be too sanguine about“knowing her well”．Intimacy is a difficult art，as Geraldine herself reminds us．

Oh，my dear [she wrote to Mrs．Carlyle]，if you and I are drowned，or die，what would become of us if any superior person were to go and write our“life and errors”？What a precious mess a“truthful person”would go and make of us，and how very different to what we really are or were！

The echo of her mockery，ungrammatical，colloquial，but as usual with the ring of truth in it，reaches us from where she lies in Lady Morgan's vault in the Brompton cemetery．





“I Am Christina Rossetti”


On the fifth of this December(1) Christina Rossetti will celebrate her centenary，or，more properly speaking，we shall celebrate it for her，and perhaps not a little to her distress，for she was one of the shyest of women，and to be spoken of，as we shall certainly speak of her，would have caused her acute discomfort．Nevertheless，it is inevitable；centenaries are inexorable；talk of her we must．We shall read her life；we shall read her Letters；we shall study her portraits，speculate about her diseases — of which she had a great variety；and rattle the drawers of her writing-table，which are for the most part empty．Let us begin with the biography — for what could be more amusing？As everybody knows，the fascination of reading biographies is irresistible．No sooner have we opened the pages of Miss Sandars's careful and competent book（Life of Christina Rossetti，by Mary F．Sandars．（Hutchinson））than the old illusion comes over us．Here is the past and all its inhabitants miraculously sealed as in a magic tank；all we have to do is to look and to listen and to listen and to look and soon the little figures — for they are rather under life size — will begin to move and to speak，and as they move we shall arrange them in all sorts of patterns of which they were ignorant，for they thought when they were alive that they could go where they liked；and as they speak we shall read into their sayings all kinds of meanings which never struck them，for they believed when they were alive that they said straight off whatever came into their heads．But once you are in a biography all is different．

Here，then，is Hallam Street，Portland Place，about the year 1830；and here are the Rossettis，an Italian family consisting of father and mother and four small children．The street was unfashionable and the home rather poverty-stricken；but the poverty did not matter，for，being foreigners，the Rossettis did not care much about the customs and conventions of the usual middle-class British family．They kept themselves to themselves，dressed as they liked，entertained Italian exiles，among them organ-grinders and other distressed compatriots，and made ends meet by teaching and writing and other odd jobs．By degrees Christina detached herself from the family group．It is plain that she was a quiet and observant child，with her own way of life already fixed in her head — she was to write — but all the more did she admire the superior competence of her elders．soon we begin to surround her with a few friends and to endow her with a few characteristics．She detested parties．She dressed anyhow．She liked her brother's friends and little gatherings of young artists and poets who were to reform the world，rather to her amusement，for although so sedate，she was also whimsical and freakish，and liked making fun of people who took themselves with egotistic solemnity．And though she meant to be a poet she had very little of the vanity and stress of young poets；her verses seem to have formed themselves whole and entire in her head，and she did not worry very much what was said of them because in her own mind she knew that they were good．She had also immense powers of admiration — for her mother，for example，who was so quiet，and so sagacious，so simple and so sincere；and for her elder sister Maria，who had no taste for painting or for poetry，but was，for that very reason，perhaps more vigorous and effective in daily life．For example，Maria always refused to visit the Mummy Room at the British Museum because，she said，the Day of Resurrection might suddenly dawn and it would be very unseemly if the corpses had to put on immortality under the gaze of mere sight-seers — a reflection which had not struck Christina，but seemed to her admirable．Here，of course，we，who are outside the tank，enjoy a hearty laugh，but Christina，who is inside the tank and exposed to all its heats and currents，thought her sister's conduct worthy of the highest respect．Indeed，if we look at her a little more closely we shall see that something dark and hard，like a kernel，had already formed in the centre of Christina Rossetti's being．

It was religion，of course．Even when she was quite a girl her lifelong absorption in the relation of the soul with God had taken possession of her．Her sixty-four years might seem outwardly spent in Hallam Street and Endsleigh Gardens and Torrington Square，but in reality she dwelt in some curious region where the spirit strives towards an unseen God — in her case，a dark God，a harsh God — a God who decreed that all the pleasures of the world were hateful to Him．The theatre was hateful，the opera was hateful，nakedness was hateful — when her friend Miss Thompson painted naked figures in her pictures she had to tell Christina that they were fairies，but Christina saw through the imposture — everything in Christina's life radiated from that knot of agony and intensity in the centre．Her belief regulated her life in the smallest particulars．It taught her that chess was wrong，but that whist and cribbage did not matter．But also it interfered in the most tremendous questions of her heart．There was a young painter called James Collinson，and she loved James Collinson and he loved her，but he was a Roman Catholic and so she refused him．Obligingly he became a member of the Church of England，and she accepted him．Vacillating，however，for he was a slippery man，he wobbled back to Rome，and Christina，though it broke her heart and for ever shadowed her life，cancelled the engagement．Years afterwards another，and it seems better founded，prospect of happiness presented itself．Charles Cayley proposed to her．But alas，this abstract and erudite man who shuffled about the world in a state of absent-minded dishabille，and translated the gospel into Iroquois，and asked smart ladies at a party“whether they were interested in the Gulf Stream”，and for a present gave Christina a sea mouse preserved in spirits，was，not unnaturally，a free thinker．Him，too，Christina put from her．Though“no woman ever loved a man more deeply”，she would not be the wife of a sceptic．She who loved the“obtuse and furry”— the wombats，toads，and mice of the earth — and called Charles Cayley“my blindest buzzard，my special mole”，admitted no moles，wombats，buzzards，or Cayleys to her heaven．

So one might go on looking and listening for ever．There is no limit to the strangeness，amusement，and oddity of the past sealed in a tank．But just as we are wondering which cranny of this extraordinary territory to explore next，the principal figure intervenes．It is as if a fish，whose unconscious gyrations we had been watching in and out of reeds，round and round rocks，suddenly dashed at the glass and broke it．A tea-party is the occasion．For some reason Christina went to a party given by Mrs．Virtue Tebbs．What happened there is unknown — perhaps something was said in a casual，frivolous，tea-party way about poetry．At any rate，

suddenly there uprose from a chair and paced forward into the centre of the room a little woman dressed in black，who announced solemnly，“I am Christina Rossetti！”and having so said，returned to her chair．

With those words the glass is broken．Yes [she seems to say]，I am a poet．You who pretend to honour my centenary are no better than the idle people at Mrs．Tebb's tea-party．Here you are rambling among unimportant trifles，rattling my writing-table drawers，making fun of the Mummies and Maria and my love affairs when all I care for you to know is here．Behold this green volume．It is a copy of my collected works．It costs four shillings and sixpence．Read that．And so she returns to her chair．

How absolute and unaccommodating these poets are！ Poetry，they say，has nothing to do with life．Mummies and wombats，Hallam Street and omnibuses，James Collinson and Charles Cayley，sea mice and Mrs．Virtue Tebbs，Torrington Square and Endsleigh Gardens，even the vagaries of religious belief，are irrelevant，extraneous，superfluous，unreal．It is poetry that matters．The only question of any interest is whether that poetry is good or bad．But this question of poetry，one might point out if only to gain time，is one of the greatest difficulty．Very little of value has been said about poetry since the world began．The judgment of contemporaries is almost always wrong．For example，most of the poems which figure in Christina Rossetti's complete works were rejected by editors．Her annual income from her poetry was for many years about ten pounds．On the other hand，the works of Jean Ingelow，as she noted sardonically，went into eight editions．There were，of course，among her contemporaries one or two poets and one or two critics whose judgment must be respectfully consulted．But what very different impressions they seem to gather from the same works — by what different standards they judge！ For instance，when Swinburne read her poetry he exclaimed：“I have always thought that nothing more glorious in poetry has ever been written”，and went on to say of her New Year Hymn

that it was touched as with the fire and bathed as in the light of sunbeams，tuned as to chords and cadences of refluent sea-music beyond reach of harp and organ，large echoes of the serene and sonorous tides of heaven

Then Professor Saintsbury comes with his vast learning，and examines Goblin Market，and reports that

The metre of the principal poem [“Goblin Market”] may be best described as a dedoggerelised Skeltonic，with the gathered music of the various metrical progress since Spenser，utilised in the place of the wooden rattling of the followers of Chaucer．There may be discerned in it the same inclination towards line irregularity which has broken out，at different times，in the Pindaric of the late seventeenth and earlier eighteenth centuries，and in the rhymelessness of Sayers earlier and of Mr．Arnold later．

And then there is Sir Walter Raleigh：

I think she is the best poet alive .... The worst of it is you cannot lecture on really pure poetry any more than you can talk about the ingredients of pure water — it is adulterated，methylated，sanded poetry that makes the best lectures．The only thing that Christina makes me want to do，is cry，not lecture．

It would appear，then，that there are at least three schools of criticism：the refluent sea-music school；the line-irregularity school，and the school that bids one not criticise but cry．This is confusing；if we follow them all we shall only come to grief．Better perhaps read for oneself，expose the mind bare to the poem，and transcribe in all its haste and imperfection whatever may be the result of the impact．In this case it might run something as follows：O Christina Rossetti，I have humbly to confess that though I know many of your poems by heart，I have not read your works from cover to cover．I have not followed your course and traced your development．I doubt indeed that you developed very much．You were an instinctive poet．You saw the world from the same angle always．Years and the traffic of the mind with men and books did not affect you in the least．You carefully ignored any book that could shake your faith or any human being who could trouble your instincts．You were wise perhaps．Your instinct was so sure，so direct，so intense that it produced poems that sing like music in one's ears — like a melody by Mozart or an air by Gluck．Yet for all its symmetry，yours was a complex song．When you struck your harp many strings sounded together．Like all instinctives you had a keen sense of the visual beauty of the world．Your poems are full of gold dust and“sweet geraniums' varied brightness”；your eye noted incessantly how rushes are“velvet-headed”，and lizards have a“strange metallic mail”— your eye，indeed，observed with a sensual pre-Raphaelite intensity that must have surprised Christina the Anglo-Catholic．But to her you owed perhaps the fixity and sadness of your muse．The pressure of a tremendous faith circles and clamps together these little songs．Perhaps they owe to it their solidity．Certainly they owe to it their sadness — your God was a harsh God，your heavenly crown was set with thorns．No sooner have you feasted on beauty with your eyes than your mind tells you that beauty is vain and beauty passes．Death，oblivion，and rest lap round your songs with their dark wave．And then，incongruously，a sound of scurrying and laughter is heard．There is the patter of animals' feet and the odd guttural notes of rooks and the snufflings of obtuse furry animals grunting and nosing．For you were not a pure saint by any means．You pulled legs；you tweaked noses．You were at war with all humbug and pretence．Modest as you were，still you were drastic，sure of your gift，convinced of your vision．A firm hand pruned your lines；a sharp ear tested their music．Nothing soft，otiose，irrelevant cumbered your pages．In a word，you were an artist．And thus was kept open，even when you wrote idly，tinkling bells for your own diversion，a pathway for the descent of that fiery visitant who came now and then and fused your lines into that indissoluble connection which no hand can put asunder：

But bring me poppies brimmed with sleepy death

And ivy choking what it garlandeth

And primroses that open to the moon．

Indeed so strange is the constitution of things，and so great the miracle of poetry，that some of the poems you wrote in your little back room will be found adhering in perfect symmetry when the Albert Memorial is dust and tinsel．Our remote posterity will be singing：

When I am dead，my dearest，

or：

My heart is like a singing bird，

when Torrington Square is a reef of coral perhaps and the fishes shoot in and out where your bedroom window used to be；or perhaps the forest will have reclaimed those pavements and the wombat and the ratel will be shuffling on soft，uncertain feet among the green undergrowth that will then tangle the area railings．In view of all this，and to return to your biography，had I been present when Mrs．Virtue Tebbs gave her party，and had a short elderly woman in black risen to her feet and advanced to the middle of the room，I should certainly have committed some indiscretion — have broken a paper-knife or smashed a tea-cup in the awkward ardour of my admiration when she said，“I am Christina Rossetti”．

“Jane Eyre”And“Wuthering Heights”


Of the hundred years that have passed since Charlotte Brontë was born，she，the centre now of so much legend，devotion，and literature，lived but thirty-nine．It is strange to reflect how different those legends might have been had her life reached the ordinary human span．She might have become，like some of her famous contemporaries，a figure familiarly met with in London and elsewhere，the subject of pictures and anecdotes innumerable，the writer of many novels，of memoirs possibly，removed from us well within the memory of the middle-aged in all the splendour of established fame．She might have been wealthy，she might have been prosperous．But it is not so．When we think of her we have to imagine some one who had no lot in our modern world；we have to cast our minds back to the' fifties of the last century，to a remote parsonage upon the wild Yorkshire moors．In that parsonage，and on those moors，unhappy and lonely，in her poverty and her exaltation，she remains for ever．

These circumstances，as they affected her character，may have left their traces on her work．A novelist，we reflect，is bound to build up his structure with much very perishable material which begins by lending it reality and ends by cumbering it with rubbish．As we open Jane Eyre once more we cannot stifle the suspicion that we shall find her world of imagination as antiquated，mid-Victorian，and out of date as the parsonage on the moor，a place only to be visited by the curious，only preserved by the pious．so we open Jane Eyre；and in two pages every doubt is swept clean from our minds．

Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand；to the left were the clear panes of glass，protecting，but not separating me from the drear November day．At intervals，while turning over the leaves of my book，I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon．Afar，it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud；near，a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub，with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast．

There is nothing there more perishable than the moor itself，or more subject to the sway of fashion than the“long and lamentable blast”．Nor is this exhilaration short-lived．It rushes us through the entire volume，without giving us time to think，without letting us lift our eyes from the page．so intense is our absorption that if some one moves in the room the movement seems to take place not there but up in Yorkshire．The writer has us by the hand，forces us along her road，makes us see what she sees，never leaves us for a moment or allows us to forget her．At the end we are steeped through and through with the genius，the vehemence，the indignation of Charlotte Brontë．Remarkable faces，figures of strong outline and gnarled feature have flashed upon us in passing；but it is through her eyes that we have seen them．Once she is gone，we seek for them in vain．Think of Rochester and we have to think of Jane Eyre．Think of the moor，and again there is Jane Eyre．Think of the drawing-room，even，those“white carpets on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers”，that“pale Parian mantelpiece”with its Bohemia glass of“ruby red”and the“general blending of snow and fire”— what is all that except Jane Eyre？

Charlotte and Emily Brontë had much the same sense of colour．“... we saw — ah！ It was beautiful — a splendid place carpeted with crimson，and crimson-covered chairs and tables，and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold，a shower of glass drops hanging in silver chains from the centre，and shimmering with little soft tapers”（Wuthering Heights）．“Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room，and within it a boudoir，both spread with white carpets，on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers；both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine leaves，beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans；while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemia glass，ruby red；and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire”（Jane Eyre）．

The drawbacks of being Jane Eyre are not far to seek．Always to be a governess and always to be in love is a serious limitation in a world which is full，after all，of people who are neither one nor the other．The characters of a Jane Austen or of a Tolstoy have a million facets compared with these．They live and are complex by means of their effect upon many different people who serve to mirror them in the round．They move hither and thither whether their creators watch them or not，and the world in which they live seems to us an independent world which we can visit，now that they have created it，by ourselves．Thomas Hardy is more akin to Charlotte Brontë in the power of his personality and the narrowness of his vision．But the differences are vast．As we read Jude the Obscure we are not rushed to a finish；we brood and ponder and drift away from the text in plethoric trains of thought which build up round the characters an atmosphere of question and suggestion of which they are themselves，as often as not，unconscious．Simple peasants as they are，we are forced to confront them with destinies and questionings of the hugest import，so that often it seems as if the most important characters in a Hardy novel are those which have no names．Of this power，of this speculative curiosity，Charlotte Brontë has no trace．She does not attempt to solve the problems of human life；she is even unaware that such problems exist；all her force，and it is the more tremendous for being constricted，goes into the assertion，“I love”，“I hate”，“I suffer”．

For the self-centred and self-limited writers have a power denied the more catholic and broad-minded．Their impressions are close packed and strongly stamped between their narrow walls．Nothing issues from their minds which has not been marked with their own impress．They learn little from other writers，and what they adopt they cannot assimilate．Both Hardy and Charlotte Brontë appear to have founded their styles upon a stiff and decorous journalism．The staple of their prose is awkward and unyielding．But both with labour and the most obstinate integrity，by thinking every thought until it has subdued words to itself，have forged for themselves a prose which takes the mould of their minds entire；which has，into the bargain，a beauty，a power，a swiftness of its own．Charlotte Brontë at least，owed nothing to the reading of many books．She never learnt the smoothness of the professional writer，or acquired his ability to stuff and sway his language as he chooses．“I could never rest in communication with strong，discreet，and refined minds，whether male or female”，she writes，as any leader-writer in a provincial journal might have written；but gathering fire and speed goes on in her own authentic voice“till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve and crossed the threshold of confidence，and won a place by their hearts' very hearthstone”．It is there that she takes her seat；it is the red and fitful glow of the heart's fire which illumines her page．In other words，we read Charlotte Brontë not for exquisite observation of character — her characters are vigorous and elementary；not for comedy — hers is grim and crude；not for a philosophic view of life — hers is that of a country parson's daughter；but for her poetry．Probably that is so with all writers who have，as she has，an overpowering personality，so that，as we say in real life，they have only to open the door to make themselves felt．There is in them some untamed ferocity perpetually at war with the accepted order of things which makes them desire to create instantly rather than to observe patiently．This very ardour，rejecting half shades and other minor impediments，wings its way past the daily conduct of ordinary people and allies itself with their more inarticulate passions．It makes them poets，or，if they choose to write in prose，intolerant of its restrictions．Hence it is that both Emily and Charlotte are always invoking the help of nature．They both feel the need of some more powerful symbol of the vast and slumbering passions in human nature than words or actions can convey．It is with a description of a storm that Charlotte ends her finest novel Villette．“The skies hang full and dark — a wrack sails from the west；the clouds cast themselves into strange forms．”so she calls in nature to describe a state of mind which could not otherwise be expressed．But neither of the sisters observed nature accurately as Dorothy Wordsworth observed it，or painted it minutely as Tennyson painted it．They seized those aspects of the earth which were most akin to what they themselves felt or imputed to their characters，and so their storms，their moors，their lovely spaces of summer weather are not ornaments applied to decorate a dull page or display the writer's powers of observation — they carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of the book．

The meaning of a book，which lies so often apart from what happens and what is said and consists rather in some connection which things in themselves different have had for the writer，is necessarily hard to grasp．Especially this is so when，like the Brontës，the writer is poetic，and his meaning inseparable from his language，and itself rather a mood than a particular observation．Wuthering Heights is a more difficult book to understand than Jane Eyre，because Emily was a greater poet than Charlotte．When Charlotte wrote she said with eloquence and splendour and passion“I love”，“I hate”，“I suffer”．Her experience，though more intense，is on a level with our own．But there is no“I”in Wuthering Heights．There are no governesses．There are no employers．There is love，but it is not the love of men and women．Emily was inspired by some more general conception．The impulse which urged her to create was not her own suffering or her own injuries．She looked out upon a world cleft into gigantic disorder and felt within her the power to unite it in a book．That gigantic ambition is to be felt throughout the novel — a struggle，half thwarted but of superb conviction，to say something through the mouths of her characters which is not merely“I love”or“I hate”，but“we，the whole human race”and“you，the eternal powers ...”the sentence remains unfinished．It is not strange that it should be so；rather it is astonishing that she can make us feel what she had it in her to say at all．It surges up in the half-articulate words of Catherine Earnshaw，“If all else perished and he remained，I should still continue to be；and if all else remained and he were annihilated，the universe would turn to a mighty stranger；I should not seem part of it”．It breaks out again in the presence of the dead．“I see a repose that neither earth nor hell can break，and I feel an assurance of the endless and shadowless hereafter — the eternity they have entered — where life is boundless in its duration，and love in its sympathy and joy in its fulness．”It is this suggestion of power underlying the apparitions of human nature and lifting them up into the presence of greatness that gives the book its huge stature among other novels．But it was not enough for Emily Brontë to write a few lyrics，to utter a cry，to express a creed．In her poems she did this once and for all，and her poems will perhaps outlast her novel．But she was novelist as well as poet．She must take upon herself a more laborious and a more ungrateful task．She must face the fact of other existences，grapple with the mechanism of external things，build up，in recognisable shape，farms and houses and report the speeches of men and women who existed independently of herself．And so we reach these summits of emotion not by rant or rhapsody but by hearing a girl sing old songs to herself as she rocks in the branches of a tree；by watching the moor sheep crop the turf；by listening to the soft wind breathing through the grass．The life at the farm with all its absurdities and its improbability is laid open to us．We are given every opportunity of comparing Wuthering Heights with a real farm and Heathcliff with a real man．How，we are allowed to ask，can there be truth or insight or the finer shades of emotion in men and women who so little resemble what we have seen ourselves？But even as we ask it we see in Heathcliff the brother that a sister of genius might have seen；he is impossible we say，but nevertheless no boy in literature has a more vivid existence than his．so it is with the two Catherines；never could women feel as they do or act in their manner，we say．All the same，they are the most lovable women in English fiction．It is as if she could tear up all that we know human beings by，and fill these unrecognisable transparences with such a gust of life that they transcend reality．Hers，then，is the rarest of all powers．She could free life from its dependence on facts；with a few touches indicate the spirit of a face so that it needs no body；by speaking of the moor make the wind blow and the thunder roar．





Lord Chesterfield's Letters to His son


When Lord Mahon edited the Letters of Lord Chesterfield he thought it necessary to warn the intending reader that they are“by no means fitted for early or indiscriminate perusal”．Only“those people whose understandings are fixed and whose principles are matured”can，so his Lordship said，read them with impunity．But that was in 1845．And 1845 looks a little distant now．It seems to us now the age of enormous houses without any bathrooms．Men smoke in the kitchen after the cook has gone to bed．Albums lie upon drawing-room tables．The curtains are very thick and the women are very pure．But the eighteenth century also has undergone a change．To us in 1930 it looks less strange，less remote than those early Victorian years．Its civilisation seems more rational and more complete than the civilisation of Lord Mahon and his contemporaries．Then at any rate a small group of highly educated people lived up to their ideals．If the world was smaller it was also more compact；it knew its own mind；it had its own standards．Its poetry is affected by the same security．When we read the Rape of the Lock we seem to find ourselves in an age so settled and so circumscribed that masterpieces were possible．Then，we say to ourselves，a poet could address himself whole-heartedly to his task and keep his mind upon it，so that the little boxes on a lady's dressing-table are fixed among the solid possessions of our imaginations．A game at cards or a summer's boating party upon the Thames has power to suggest the same beauty and the same sense of things vanishing that we receive from poems aimed directly at our deepest emotions．And just as the poet could spend all his powers upon a pair of scissors and a lock of hair，so too，secure in his world and its values，the aristocrat could lay down precise laws for the education of his son．In that world also there was a certainty，a security that we are now without．What with one thing and another times have changed．We can now read Lord Chesterfield's Letters without blushing，or，if we do blush，we blush in the twentieth century at passages that caused Lord Mahon no discomfort whatever．

When the Letters begin，Philip Stanhope，Lord Chesterfield's natural son by a Dutch governess，was a little boy of seven．And if we are to make any complaint against the father's moral teaching，it is that the standard is too high for such tender years．“Let us return to oratory，or the art of speaking well；which should never be entirely out of our thoughts”，he writes to the boy of seven．“A man can make no figure without it in Parliament，or the Church，or in the law”，he continues，as if the little boy were already considering his career．It seems，indeed，that the father's fault，if fault it be，is one common to distinguished men who have not themselves succeeded as they should have done and are determined to give their children — and Philip was an only child — the chances that they have lacked．Indeed，as the Letters go on one may suppose that Lord Chesterfield wrote as much to amuse himself by turning over the stores of his experience，his reading，his knowledge of the world，as to instruct his son．The Letters show an eagerness，an animation，which prove that to write to Philip was not a task，but a delight．Tired，perhaps，with the duties of office and disillusioned with its disappointments，he takes up his pen and，in the relief of free communication at last，forgets that his correspondent is，after all，only a schoolboy who cannot understand half the things that his father says to him．But，even so，there is nothing to repel us in Lord Chesterfield's preliminary sketch of the unknown world．He is all on the side of moderation，toleration，ratiocination．Never abuse whole bodies of people，he counsels；frequent all churches，laugh at none；inform yourself about all things．Devote your mornings to study，your evenings to good society．Dress as the best people dress，behave as they behave，never be eccentric，egotistical，or absent-minded．Observe the laws of proportion，and live every moment to the full．

So，step by step，he builds up the figure of the perfect man — the man that Philip may become，he is persuaded，if he will only — and here Lord Chesterfield lets fall the words which are to colour his teaching through and through — cultivate the Graces．These ladies are，at first，kept discreetly in the background．It is well that the boy should be indulged in fine sentiments about women and poets to begin with．Lord Chesterfield adjures him to respect them both．“For my own part，I used to think myself in company as much above me when I was with Mr．Addison and Mr．Pope，as if I had been with all the Princes in Europe”，he writes．But as time goes on the Virtues are more and more taken for granted．They can be left to take care of themselves．But the Graces assume tremendous proportions．The Graces dominate the life of man in this world．Their service cannot for an instant be neglected．And the service is certainly exacting．For consider what it implies，this art of pleasing．To begin with，one must know how to come into a room and then how to go out again．As human arms and legs are notoriously perverse，this by itself is a matter needing considerable dexterity．Then one must be dressed so that one's clothes seem perfectly fashionable without being new or striking；one's teeth must be perfect；one's wig beyond reproach；one's finger-nails cut in the segment of a circle；one must be able to carve，able to dance，and，what is almost as great an art，able to sit gracefully in a chair．These things are the alphabet of the art of pleasing．We now come to speech．It is necessary to speak at least three languages to perfection．But before we open our lips we must take a further precaution — we must be on our guard never to laugh．Lord Chesterfield himself never laughed．He always smiled．When at length the young man is pronounced capable of speech he must avoid all proverbs and vulgar expressions；he must enunciate clearly and use perfect grammar；he must not argue；he must not tell stories；he must not talk about himself．Then，at last，the young man may begin to practise the finest of the arts of pleasing — the art of flattery．For every man and every woman has some prevailing vanity．Watch，wait，pry，seek out their weakness，“and you will then know what to bait your hook with to catch them”．For that is the secret of success in the world．

It is at this point，such is the idiosyncrasy of our age，that we begin to feel uneasy．Lord Chesterfield's views upon success are far more questionable than his views upon love．For what is to be the prize of this endless effort and self-abnegation？What do we gain when we have learnt to come into rooms and to go out again；to pry into people's secrets；to hold our tongues and to flatter，to forsake the society of low-born people which corrupts and the society of clever people which perverts？What is the prize which is to reward us？It is simply that we shall rise in the world．Press for a further definition，and it amounts perhaps to this：one will be popular with the best people．But if we are so exacting as to demand who the best people are we become involved in a labyrinth from which there is no returning．Nothing exists in itself．What is good society？It is the society that the best people believe to be good．What is wit？It is what the best people think to be witty．All value depends upon somebody else's opinion．For it is the essence of this philosophy that things have no independent existence，but live only in the eyes of other people．It is a looking-glass world，this，to which we climb so slowly；and its prizes are all reflections．That may account for our baffled feeling as we shuffle，and shuffle vainly，among these urbane pages for something hard to lay our hands upon．Hardness is the last thing we shall find．But，granted the deficiency，how much that is ignored by sterner moralists is here seized upon，and who shall deny，at least while Lord Chesterfield's enchantment is upon him，that these imponderable qualities have their value and these shining Graces have their radiance？Consider for a moment what the Graces have done for their devoted servant，the Earl．

Here is a disillusioned politician，who is prematurely aged，who has lost his office，who is losing his teeth，who，worst fate of all，is growing deafer day by day．Yet he never allows a groan to escape him．He is never dull；he is never boring；he is never slovenly．His mind is as well groomed as his body．Never for a second does he“welter in an easy-chair”．Private though these Letters are，and apparently spontaneous，they play with such ease in and about the single subject which absorbs them that it never becomes tedious or，what is still more remarkable，never becomes ridiculous．It may be that the art of pleasing has some connection with the art of writing．To be polite，considerate，controlled，to sink one's egotism，to conceal rather than to obtrude one's personality，may profit the writer even as they profit the man of fashion．

Certainly there is much to be said in favour of the training，however we define it，which helped Lord Chesterfield to write his Characters．The little papers have the precision and formality of some old-fashioned minuet．Yet the symmetry is so natural to the artist that he can break it where he likes；it never becomes pinched and formal，as it would in the hands of an imitator．He can be sly；he can be witty；he can be sententious，but never for an instant does he lose his sense of time，and when the tune is over he calls a halt．“Some succeeded，and others burst”he says of George the First's mistresses：the King liked them fat．Again，“He was fixed in the house of lords，that hospital of incurables．”He smiles：he does not laugh．Here the eighteenth century，of course，came to his help．Lord Chesterfield，though he was polite to everything，even to the stars and Bishop Berkeley's philosophy，firmly refused，as became a son of his age，to dally with infinity or to suppose that things are not quite as solid as they seem．The world was good enough and the world was big enough as it was．This prosaic temper，while it keeps him within the bounds of impeccable common sense，limits his outlook．No single phrase of his reverberates or penetrates as so many of La Bruyère's do．But he would have been the first to deprecate any comparison with that great writer；besides，to write as La Bruyère wrote，one must perhaps believe in something，and then how difficult to observe the Graces！ One might perhaps laugh；one might perhaps cry．Both are equally deplorable．

But while we amuse ourselves with this brilliant nobleman and his views on life we are aware，and the Letters owe much of their fascination to this consciousness，of a dumb yet substantial figure on the farther side of the page．Philip Stanhope is always there．It is true that he says nothing，but we feel his presence in Dresden，in Berlin，in Paris，opening the Letters and poring over them and looking dolefully at the thick packets which have been accumulating year after year since he was a child of seven．He had grown into a rather serious，rather stout，rather short young man．He had a taste for foreign politics．A little serious reading was rather to his liking．And by every post the Letters came — urbane，polished，brilliant，imploring and commanding him to learn to dance，to learn to carve，to consider the management of his legs，and to seduce a lady of fashion．He did his best．He worked very hard in the school of the Graces，but their service was too exacting．He sat down half-way up the steep stairs which lead to the glittering hall with all the mirrors．He could not do it．He failed in the House of Commons；he subsided into some small post in Ratisbon；he died untimely．He left it to his widow to break the news which he had lacked the heart or the courage to tell his father — that he had been married all these years to a lady of low birth，who had borne him children．

The Earl took the blow like a gentleman．His letter to his daughter-in-law is a model of urbanity．He began the education of his grandsons．But he seems to have become a little indifferent to what happened to himself after that．He did not care greatly if he lived or died．But still to the very end he cared for the Graces．His last words were a tribute of respect to those goddesses．someone came into the room when he was dying；he roused himself：“Give Dayrolles a chair，”he said，and said no more．





“Aurora Leigh”


By one of those ironies of fashion that might have amused the Brownings themselves，it seems likely that they are now far better known in the flesh than they have ever been in the spirit．Passionate lovers，in curls and side-whiskers，oppressed，defiant，eloping — in this guise thousands of people must know and love the Brownings who have never read a line of their poetry．They have become two of the most conspicuous figures in that bright and animated company of authors who，thanks to our modern habit of writing memoirs and printing Letters and sitting to be photographed，live in the flesh，not merely as of old in the word；are known by their hats，not merely by their poems．What damage the art of photography has inflicted upon the art of literature has yet to be reckoned．How far we are going to read a poet when we can read about a poet is a problem to lay before biographers．Meanwhile，nobody can deny the power of the Brownings to excite our sympathy and rouse our interest．“Lady Geraldine's Courtship”is glanced at perhaps by two professors in American universities once a year；but we all know how Miss Barrett lay on her sofa；how she escaped from the dark house in Wimpole Street one September morning；how she met health and happiness，freedom，and Robert Browning in the church round the corner．

But fate has not been kind to Mrs．Browning as a writer．Nobody reads her，nobody discusses her，nobody troubles to put her in her place．One has only to compare her reputation with Christina Rossetti's to trace her decline．Christina Rossetti mounts irresistibly to the first place among English women poets．Elizabeth，so much more loudly applauded during her lifetime，falls farther and farther behind．The primers dismiss her with contumely．Her importance，they say，“has now become merely historical．Neither education nor association with her husband ever succeeded in teaching her the value of words and a sense of form．”In short，the only place in the mansion of literature that is assigned her is downstairs in the servants' quarters，where，in company with Mrs．Hemans，Eliza Cook，Jean Ingelow，Alexander Smith，Edwin Arnold，and Robert Montgomery，she bangs the crockery about and eats vast handfuls of peas on the point of her knife．

If，therefore，we take Aurora Leigh from the shelf it is not so much in order to read it as to muse with kindly condescension over this token of bygone fashion，as we toy with the fringes of our grandmothers' mantles and muse over the alabaster models of the Taj Mahal which once adorned their drawing-room tables．But to the Victorians，undoubtedly，the book was very dear．Thirteen editions of Aurora Leigh had been demanded by the year 1873．And，to judge from the dedication，Mrs．Browning herself was not afraid to say that she set great store by it —“the most mature of my works”，she calls it，“and the one into which my highest convictions upon Life and Art have entered”．Her Letters show that she had had the book in mind for many years．She was brooding over it when she first met Browning，and her intention with regard to it forms almost the first of those confidences about their work which the lovers delighted to share．

... my chief INTENTION［she wrote］just now is the writing of a sort of novel-poem ... running into the midst of our conventions，and rushing into drawing-rooms and the like，“where angels fear to tread”；and so，meeting face to face and without mask the Humanity of the age，and speaking the truth of it out plainly．That is my intention．

But for reasons which later become clear，she hoarded her intention throughout the ten astonishing years of escape and happiness；and when at last the book appeared in 1856 she might well feel that she had poured into it the best that she had to give．Perhaps the hoarding and the saturation which resulted have something to do with the surprise that awaits us．At any rate we cannot read the first twenty pages of Aurora Leigh without becoming aware that the Ancient Mariner who lingers，for unknown reasons，at the porch of one book and not of another has us by the hand，and makes us listen like a three years' child while Mrs．Browning pours out in nine volumes of blank verse the story of Aurora Leigh．Speed and energy，forthrightness and complete self-confidence — these are the qualities that hold us enthralled．Floated off our feet by them，we learn how Aurora was the child of an Italian mother“whose rare blue eyes were shut from seeing her when she was scarcely four years old”．Her father was“an austere Englishman，Who，after a dry lifetime spent at home in college-learning，law and parish talk，Was flooded with a passion unaware”，but died too，and the child was sent back to England to be brought up by an aunt．The aunt，of the well-known family of the Leighs，stood upon the hall step of her country house dressed in black to welcome her．Her somewhat narrow forehead was braided tight with brown hair pricked with gray；she had a close，mild mouth；eyes of no colour；and cheeks like roses pressed in books，“Kept more for ruth than pleasure，— if past bloom，Past fading also”．The lady had lived a quiet life，exercising her Christian gifts upon knitting stockings and stitching petticoats“because we are of one flesh，after all，and need one flannel”．At her hand Aurora suffered the education that was thought proper for women．She learnt a little French，a little algebra；the internal laws of the Burmese empire；what navigable river joins itself to Lara；what census of the year five was taken at Klagenfurt；also how to draw nereids neatly draped，to spin glass，to stuff birds，and model flowers in wax．For the aunt liked a woman to be womanly．Of an evening she did cross-stitch and，owing to some mistake in her choice of silk，once embroidered a shepherdess with pink eyes．Under this torture of women's education，the passionate Aurora exclaimed，certain women have died；others pine；a few who have，as Aurora had，“relations with the unseen”，survive and walk demurely，and are civil to their cousins and listen to the vicar and pour out tea．Aurora herself was blessed with a little room．It was green-papered，had a green carpet and there were green curtains to the bed，as if to match the insipid greenery of the English country-side．There she retired；there she read．“I had found the secret of a garret room Piled high with cases in my father's name，Piled high，packed large，where，creeping in and out ... like some small nimble mouse between the ribs of a mastodon”she read and read．The mouse indeed（it is the way with Mrs．Browning's mice）took wings and soared，for“It is rather when We gloriously forget ourselves and plunge soul-forward，headlong，into a book's profound，Impassioned for its beauty and salt of truth — 'Tis then we get the right good from a book”．And so she read and read，until her cousin Romney called to walk with her，or the painter Vincent Carrington，“whom men judge hardly as bee-bonneted Because he holds that paint a body well you paint a soul by implication”，tapped on the window．

This hasty abstract of the first volume of Aurora Leigh does it of course no sort of justice；but having gulped down the original much as Aurora herself advises，soul-forward，headlong，we find ourselves in a state where some attempt at the ordering of our multitudinous impressions becomes imperative．The first of these impressions and the most pervasive is the sense of the writer's presence．Through the voice of Aurora the character，the circumstances，the idiosyncrasies of Elizabeth Barrett Browning ring in our ears．Mrs．Browning could no more conceal herself than she could control herself，a sign no doubt of imperfection in an artist，but a sign also that life has impinged upon art more than life should．Again and again in the pages we have read，Aurora the fictitious seems to be throwing light upon Elizabeth the actual．The idea of the poem，we must remember，came to her in the early forties when the connexion between a woman's art and a woman's life was unnaturally close，so that it is impossible for the most austere of critics not sometimes to touch the flesh when his eyes should be fixed upon the page．And as everybody knows，the life of Elizabeth Barrett was of a nature to affect the most authentic and individual of gifts．Her mother had died when she was a child；she had read profusely and privately；her favourite brother was drowned；her health broke down；she had been immured by the tyranny of her father in almost conventual seclusion in a bedroom in Wimpole Street．But instead of rehearsing the well-known facts，it is better to read in her own words her own account of the effect they had upon her．

I have lived only inwardly［she wrote］or with SORROW，for a strong emotion．Before this seclusion of my illness，I was secluded still，and there are few of the youngest women in the world who have not seen more，heard more，known more，of society，than I，who am scarcely to be called young now．I grew up in the country — I had no social opportunities，had my heart in books and poetry，and my experience in reveries．And so time passed and passed — and afterwards，when my illness came ... and no prospect（as appeared at one time）of ever passing the threshold of one room again；why then，I turned to thinking with some bitterness ... that I had stood blind in this temple I was about to leave — that I had seen no Human nature，that my brothers and sisters of the earth were NAMES to me，that I had beheld no great mountain or river，nothing in fact .... And do you also know what a disadvantage this ignorance is to my art？Why，if I live on and yet do not escape from this seclusion，do you not perceive that I labour under signal disadvantages — that I am，in a manner as a BLIND POET？Certainly，there is compensation to a degree．I have had much of the inner life，and from the habit of self-consciousness and self-analysis，I make great guesses at Human nature in the main．But how willingly I would as a poet exchange some of this lumbering，ponderous，helpless knowledge of books，for some experience of life and man，for some ...

She breaks off，with three little dots，and we may take advantage of her pause to turn once more to Aurora Leigh．

What damage had her life done her as a poet？A great one，we cannot deny．For it is clear，as we turn the pages of Aurora Leigh or of the Letters — one often echoes the other — that the mind which found its natural expression in this swift and chaotic poem about real men and women was not the mind to profit by solitude．A lyrical，a scholarly，a fastidious mind might have used seclusion and solitude to perfect its powers．Tennyson asked no better than to live with books in the heart of the country．But the mind of Elizabeth Barrett was lively and secular and satirical．She was no scholar．Books were to her not an end in themselves but a substitute for living．She raced through folios because she was forbidden to scamper on the grass．She wrestled with Aeschylus and Plato because it was out of the question that she should argue about politics with live men and women．Her favourite reading as an invalid was Balzac and George Sand and other“immortal improprieties”because“they kept the colour in my life to some degree”．Nothing is more striking when at last she broke the prison bars than the fervour with which she flung herself into the life of the moment．She loved to sit in a café and watch people passing；she loved the arguments，the politics，and the strife of the modern world．The past and its ruins，even the past of Italy and Italian ruins，interested her much less than the theories of Mr．Hume the medium，or the politics of Napoleon，Emperor of the French．Italian pictures，Greek poetry，roused in her a clumsy and conventional enthusiasm in strange contrast with the original independence of her mind when it applied itself to actual facts．

Such being her natural bent，it is not surprising that even in the depths of her sick-room her mind turned to modern life as a subject for poetry．She waited，wisely，until her escape had given her some measure of knowledge and proportion．But it cannot be doubted that the long years of seclusion had done her irreparable damage as an artist．She had lived shut off，guessing at what was outside，and inevitably magnifying what was within．The loss of Flush，the spaniel，affected her as the loss of a child might have affected another woman．The tap of ivy on the pane became the thrash of trees in a gale．Every sound was enlarged，every incident exaggerated，for the silence of the sick-room was profound and the monotony of Wimpole Street was intense．When at last she was able to“rush into drawing-rooms and the like and meet face to face without mask the Humanity of the age and speak the truth of it out plainly”，she was too weak to stand the shock．ordinary daylight，current gossip，the usual traffic of human beings left her exhausted，ecstatic，and dazzled into a state where she saw so much and felt so much that she did not altogether know what she felt or what she saw．

Aurora Leigh，the novel-poem，is not，therefore，the masterpiece that it might have been．Rather it is a masterpiece in embryo；a work whose genius floats diffused and fluctuating in some pre-natal stage waiting the final stroke of creative power to bring it into being．Stimulating and boring，ungainly and eloquent，monstrous and exquisite，all by turns，it overwhelms and bewilders；but，nevertheless，it still commands our interest and inspires our respect．For it becomes clear as we read that，whatever Mrs．Browning's faults，she was one of those rare writers who risk themselves adventurously and disinterestedly in an imaginative life which is independent of their private lives and demands to be considered apart from personalities．Her“intention”survives；the interest of her theory redeems much that is faulty in her practice．Abridged and simplified from Aurora's argument in the fifth book，that theory runs something like this．The true work of poets，she said，is to present their own age，not Charlemagne's．More passion takes place in drawing-rooms than at Roncesvalles with Roland and his knights．“To flinch from modern varnish，coat or flounce，Cry out for togas and the picturesque，Is fatal — foolish too．”For living art presents and records real life，and the only life we can truly know is our own．But what form，she asks，can a poem on modern life take？The drama is impossible，for only servile and docile plays have any chance of success．Moreover，what we（in 1846）have to say about life is not fit for“boards，actors，prompters，gaslight，and costume；our stage is now the soul itself”．What then can she do？The problem is difficult，performance is bound to fall short of endeavour；but she has at least wrung her life-blood on to every page of her book，and，for the rest“Let me think of forms less，and the external．Trust the spirit ... Keep up the fire and leave the generous flames to shape themselves．”And so the fire blazed and the flames leapt high．

The desire to deal with modern life in poetry was not confined to Miss Barrett．Robert Browning said that he had had the same ambition all his life．Coventry Patmore's“Angel in the House”and Clough's“Bothie”were both attempts of the same kind and preceded Aurora Leigh by some years．It was natural enough．The novelists were dealing triumphantly with modern life in prose．Jane Eyre，Vanity Fair，David Copperfield，Richard Feverel all trod fast on each other's heels between the years 1847 and 1860．The poets may well have felt，with Aurora Leigh，that modern life had an intensity and a meaning of its own．Why should these spoils fall solely into the laps of the prose writers？Why should the poet be forced back to the remoteness of Charlemagne and Roland，to the toga and the picturesque，when the humours and tragedies of village life，drawing-room life，club life，and street life all cried aloud for celebration？It was true that the old form in which poetry had dealt with life — the drama — was obsolete；but was there none other that could take its place？Mrs．Browning，convinced of the divinity of poetry，pondered，seized as much as she could of actual experience，and then at last threw down her challenge to the Brontës and the Thackerays in nine books of blank verse．It was in blank verse that she sang of Shoreditch and Kensington；of my aunt and the vicar；of Romney Leigh and Vincent Carrington；of Marian Erle and Lord Howe；of fashionable weddings and drab suburban streets，and bonnets and whiskers and four-wheeled cabs，and railway trains．The poets can treat of these things，she exclaimed，as well as of knights and dames，moats and drawbridges and castle courts．But can they？Let us see what happens to a poet when he poaches upon a novelist's preserves and gives us not an epic or a lyric but the story of many lives that move and change and are inspired by the interests and passions that are ours in the middle of the reign of Queen Victoria．

In the first place there is the story；a tale has to be told；the poet must somehow convey to us the necessary information that his hero has been asked out to dinner．This is a statement that a novelist would convey as quietly and prosaically as possible；for example，“While I was kissing her glove，sadly enough，a note was brought saying that her father sent his regards and asked me to dine with them next day”．That is harmless．But the poet has to write：

While thus I grieved，and kissed her glove，

My man brought in her note to say，

Papa had bid her send his love，

And would I dine with them next day！

Which is absurd．The simple words have been made to strut and posture and take on an emphasis which makes them ridiculous．Then again，what will the poet do with dialogue？In modern life，as Mrs．Browning indicated when she said that our stage is now the soul，the tongue has superseded the sword．It is in talk that the high moments of life，the shock of character upon character，are defined．But poetry when it tries to follow the words on people's lips is terribly impeded．Listen to Romney in a moment of high emotion talking to his old love Marian about the baby she has borne to another man：

May God so father me，as I do him，

And so forsake me，as I let him feel

He's orphaned haply．Here I take the child

To share my cup，to slumber on my knee，

To play his loudest gambol at my foot，

To hold my finger in the public ways ...

and so on．Romney，in short，rants and reels like any of those Elizabethan heroes whom Mrs．Browning had warned so imperiously out of her modern living-room．Blank verse has proved itself the most remorseless enemy of living speech．Talk tossed up on the surge and swing of the verse becomes high，rhetorical，impassioned；and as talk，since action is ruled out，must go on and on，the reader's mind stiffens and glazes under the monotony of the rhythm．Following the lilt of her rhythm rather than the emotions of her characters，Mrs．Browning is swept on into generalization and declamation．Forced by the nature of her medium，she ignores the slighter，the subtler，the more hidden shades of emotion by which a novelist builds up touch by touch a character in prose．Change and development，the effect of one character upon another — all this is abandoned．The poem becomes one long soliloquy，and the only character that is known to us and the only story that is told us are the character and story of Aurora Leigh herself．

Thus，if Mrs．Browning meant by a novel-poem a book in which character is closely and subtly revealed，the relations of many hearts laid bare，and a story unfalteringly unfolded，she failed completely．But if she meant rather to give us a sense of life in general，of people who are unmistakably Victorian，wrestling with the problems of their own time，all brightened，intensified，and compacted by the fire of poetry，she succeeded．Aurora Leigh，with her passionate interest in social questions，her conflict as artist and woman，her longing for knowledge and freedom，is the true daughter of her age．Romney，too，is no less certainly a mid-Victorian gentleman of high ideals who has thought deeply about the social question，and has founded，unfortunately，a phalanstery in Shropshire．The aunt，the antimacassars，and the country house from which Aurora escapes are real enough to fetch high prices in the Tottenham Court Road at this moment．The broader aspects of what it felt like to be a Victorian are seized as surely and stamped as vividly upon us as in any novel by Trollope or Mrs．Gaskell．

And indeed if we compare the prose novel and the novel-poem the triumphs are by no means all to the credit of prose．As we rush through page after page of narrative in which a dozen scenes that the novelist would smooth out separately are pressed into one，in which pages of deliberate description are fused into a single line，we cannot help feeling that the poet has outpaced the prose writer．Her page is packed twice as full as his．Characters，too，if they are not shown in conflict but snipped off and summed up with something of the exaggeration of a caricaturist，have a heightened and symbolical significance which prose with its gradual approach cannot rival．The general aspect of things — market，sunset，church — have a brilliance and a continuity，owing to the compressions and elisions of poetry，which mock the prose writer and his slow accumulations of careful detail．For these reasons Aurora Leigh remains，with all its imperfections，a book that still lives and breathes and has its being．And when we think how still and cold the plays of Beddoes or of Sir Henry Taylor lie，in spite of all their beauty，and how seldom in our own day we disturb the repose of the classical dramas of Robert Bridges，we may suspect that Elizabeth Barrett was inspired by a flash of true genius when she rushed into the drawing-room and said that here，where we live and work，is the true place for the poet．At any rate，her courage was justified in her own case．Her bad taste，her tortured ingenuity，her floundering，scrambling，and confused impetuosity have space to spend themselves here without inflicting a deadly wound，while her ardour and abundance，her brilliant descriptive powers，her shrewd and caustic humour，infect us with her own enthusiasm．We laugh，we protest，we complain — it is absurd，it is impossible，we cannot tolerate this exaggeration a moment longer — but，nevertheless，we read to the end enthralled．What more can an author ask？But the best compliment that we can pay Aurora Leigh is that it makes us wonder why it has left no successors．Surely the street，the drawing-room，are promising subjects；modern life is worthy of the muse．But the rapid sketch that Elizabeth Barrett Browning threw off when she leapt from her couch and dashed into the drawing-room remains unfinished．The conservatism or the timidity of poets still leaves the chief spoils of modern life to the novelist．We have no novel-poem of the age of George the Fifth．





“Robinson Crusoe”


There are many ways of approaching this classical volume；but which shall we choose？Shall we begin by saying that，since Sidney died at Zutphen leaving the Arcadia unfinished，great changes had come over English life，and the novel had chosen，or had been forced to choose，its direction？A middle class had come into existence，able to read and anxious to read not only about the loves of princes and princesses，but about themselves and the details of their humdrum lives．Stretched upon a thousand pens，prose had accommodated itself to the demand；it had fitted itself to express the facts of life rather than the poetry．That is certainly one way of approaching Robinson Crusoe — through the development of the novel；but another immediately suggests itself — through the life of the author．Here too，in the heavenly pastures of biography，we may spend many more hours than are needed to read the book itself from cover to cover．The date of Defoe's birth，to begin with，is doubtful — was it 1660 or 1661？Then again，did he spell his name in one word or in two？And who were his ancestors？He is said to have been a hosier；but what，after all，was a hosier in the seventeenth century？He became a pamphleteer，and enjoyed the confidence of William the Third；one of his pamphlets caused him to be stood in the pillory and imprisoned at Newgate；he was employed by Harley and later by Godolphin；he was the first of the hireling journalists；he wrote innumerable pamphlets and articles；also Moll Flanders and Robinson Crusoe；he had a wife and six children；was spare in figure，with a hooked nose，a sharp chin，grey eyes，and a large mole near his mouth．Nobody who has any slight acquaintance with English literature needs to be told how many hours can be spent and how many lives have been spent in tracing the development of the novel and in examining the chins of the novelists．Only now and then，as we turn from theory to biography and from biography to theory，a doubt insinuates itself — if we knew the very moment of Defoe's birth and whom he loved and why，if we had by heart the history of the origin，rise，growth，decline，and fall of the English novel from its conception（say）in Egypt to its decease in the wilds（perhaps）of Paraguay，should we suck an ounce of additional pleasure from Robinson Crusoe or read it one whit more intelligently？

For the book itself remains．However we may wind and wriggle，loiter and dally in our approach to books，a lonely battle waits us at the end．There is a piece of business to be transacted between writer and reader before any further dealings are possible，and to be reminded in the middle of this private interview that Defoe sold stockings，had brown hair，and was stood in the pillory is a distraction and a worry．Our first task，and it is often formidable enough，is to master his perspective．Until we know how the novelist orders his world，the ornaments of that world，which the critics press upon us，the adventures of the writer，to which biographers draw attention，are superfluous possessions of which we can make no use．All alone we must climb upon the novelist's shoulders and gaze through his eyes until we，too，understand in what order he ranges the large common objects upon which novelists are fated to gaze：man and men；behind them Nature；and above them that power which for convenience and brevity we may call God．And at once confusion，misjudgement，and difficulty begin．Simple as they appear to us，these objects can be made monstrous and indeed unrecognizable by the manner in which the novelist relates them to each other．It would seem to be true that people who live cheek by jowl and breathe the same air vary enormously in their sense of proportion；to one the human being is vast，the tree minute；to the other，trees are huge and human beings insignificant little objects in the background．so，in spite of the text-books，writers may live at the same time and see nothing the same size．Here is Scott，for example，with his mountains looming huge and his men therefore drawn to scale；Jane Austen picking out the roses on her tea-cups to match the wit of her dialogues；while Peacock bends over heaven and earth one fantastic distorting mirror in which a tea-cup may be Vesuvius or Vesuvius a tea-cup．Nevertheless Scott，Jane Austen，and Peacock lived through the same years；they saw the same world；they are covered in the text-books by the same stretch of literary history．It is in their perspective that they are different．If，then，it were granted us to grasp this firmly，for ourselves，the battle would end in victory；and we could turn，secure in our intimacy，to enjoy the various delights with which the critics and biographers so generously supply us．

But here many difficulties arise．For we have our own vision of the world；we have made it from our own experience and prejudices，and it is therefore bound up with our own vanities and loves．It is impossible not to feel injured and insulted if tricks are played and our private harmony is upset．Thus when Jude the Obscure appears or a new volume of Proust，the newspapers are flooded with protests．Major Gibbs of Cheltenham would put a bullet through his head tomorrow if life were as Hardy paints it；Miss Wiggs of Hampstead must protest that though Proust's art is wonderful，the real world，she thanks God，has nothing in common with the distortions of a perverted Frenchman．Both the gentleman and the lady are trying to control the novelist's perspective so that it shall resemble and reinforce their own．But the great writer — the Hardy or the Proust — goes on his way regardless of the rights of private property；by the sweat of his brow he brings order from chaos；he plants his tree there，and his man here；he makes the figure of his deity remote or present as he wills．In masterpieces — books，that is，where the vision is clear and order has been achieved — he inflicts his own perspective upon us so severely that as often as not we suffer agonies — our vanity is injured because our own order is upset；we are afraid because the old supports are being wrenched from us；and we are bored — for what pleasure or amusement can be plucked from a brand new idea？Yet from anger，fear，and boredom a rare and lasting delight is sometimes born．

Robinson Crusoe，it may be，is a case in point．It is a masterpiece，and it is a masterpiece largely because Defoe has throughout kept consistently to his own sense of perspective．For this reason he thwarts us and flouts us at every turn．Let us look at the theme largely and loosely，comparing it with our preconceptions．It is，we know，the story of a man who is thrown，after many perils and adventures，alone upon a desert island．The mere suggestion — peril and solitude and a desert island — is enough to rouse in us the expectation of some far land on the limits of the world；of the sun rising and the sun setting；of man，isolated from his kind，brooding alone upon the nature of society and the strange ways of men．Before we open the book we have perhaps vaguely sketched out the kind of pleasure we expect it to give us．We read；and we are rudely contradicted on every page．There are no sunsets and no sunrises；there is no solitude and no soul．There is，on the contrary，staring us full in the face nothing but a large earthenware pot．We are told，that is to say，that it was the 1st of September 1651；that the hero's name is Robinson Crusoe；and that his father has the gout．Obviously，then，we must alter our attitude．Reality，fact，substance is going to dominate all that follows．We must hastily alter our proportions throughout；Nature must furl her splendid purples；she is only the giver of drought and water；man must be reduced to a struggling，life-preserving animal；and God shrivel into a magistrate whose seat，substantial and somewhat hard，is only a little way above the horizon．Each sortie of ours in pursuit of information upon these cardinal points of perspective — God，man，Nature — is snubbed back with ruthless common sense．Robinson Crusoe thinks of God：“sometimes I would expostulate with myself，why providence should thus completely ruin its creatures .... But something always return'd swift upon me to check these thoughts．”God does not exist．He thinks of Nature，the fields“adorn'd with flowers and grass，and full of very fine woods”，but the important thing about a wood is that it harbours an abundance of parrots who may be tamed and taught to speak．Nature does not exist．He considers the dead，whom he has killed himself．It is of the utmost importance that they should be buried at once，for“they lay open to the sun and would presently be offensive”．Death does not exist．Nothing exists except an earthenware pot．Finally，that is to say，we are forced to drop our own preconceptions and to accept what Defoe himself wishes to give us．

Let us then go back to the beginning and repeat again，“I was born in the year 1632 in the city of York of a good family”．Nothing could be plainer，more matter of fact，than that beginning．We are drawn on soberly to consider all the blessings of orderly，industrious middle-class life．There is no greater good fortune we are assured than to be born of the British middle class．The great are to be pitied and so are the poor；both are exposed to distempers and uneasiness；the middle station between the mean and the great is the best；and its virtues — temperance，moderation，quietness，and health — are the most desirable．It was a sorry thing，then，when by some evil fate a middle-class youth was bitten with the foolish love of adventure．so he proses on，drawing，little by little，his own portrait，so that we never forget it — imprinting upon us indelibly，for he never forgets it either，his shrewdness，his caution，his love of order and comfort and respectability；until by whatever means，we find ourselves at sea，in a storm；and，peering out，everything is seen precisely as it appears to Robinson Crusoe．The waves，the seamen，the sky，the ship — all are seen through those shrewd，middle-class，unimaginative eyes．There is no escaping him．Everything appears as it would appear to that naturally cautious，apprehensive，conventional，and solidly matter-of-fact intelligence．He is incapable of enthusiasm．He has a natural slight distaste for the sublimities of Nature．He suspects even Providence of exaggeration．He is so busy and has such an eye to the main chance that he notices only a tenth part of what is going on round him．Everything is capable of a rational explanation，he is sure，if only he had time to attend to it．We are much more alarmed by the“vast great creatures”that swim out in the night and surround his boat than he is．He at once takes his gun and fires at them，and off they swim — whether they are lions or not he really cannot say．Thus before we know it we are opening our mouths wider and wider．We are swallowing monsters that we should have jibbed at if they had been offered us by an imaginative and flamboyant traveller．But anything that this sturdy middle-class man notices can be taken for a fact．He is for ever counting his barrels，and making sensible provisions for his water supply；nor do we ever find him tripping even in a matter of detail．Has he forgotten，we wonder，that he has a great lump of beeswax on board？Not at all．But as he had already made candles out of it，it is not nearly as great on page thirty-eight as it was on page twenty-three．When for a wonder he leaves some inconsistency hanging loose — why if the wild cats are so very tame are the goats so very shy？— we are not seriously perturbed，for we are sure that there was a reason，and a very good one，had he time to give it us．But the pressure of life when one is fending entirely for oneself alone on a desert island is really no laughing matter．It is no crying one either．A man must have an eye to everything；it is no time for raptures about Nature when the lightning may explode one's gunpowder — it is imperative to seek a safer lodging for it．And so by means of telling the truth undeviatingly as it appears to him — by being a great artist and forgoing this and daring that in order to give effect to his prime quality，a sense of reality — he comes in the end to make common actions dignified and common objects beautiful．To dig，to bake，to plant，to build — how serious these simple occupations are；hatchets，scissors，logs，axes — how beautiful these simple objects become．Unimpeded by comment，the story marches on with magnificent downright simplicity．Yet how could comment have made it more impressive？It is true that he takes the opposite way from the psychologist's — he describes the effect of emotion on the body，not on the mind．But when he says how，in a moment of anguish，he clinched his hands so that any soft thing would have been crushed；how“my teeth in my head would strike together，and set against one another so strong that for the time I could not part them again”，the effect is as deep as pages of analysis could have made it．His own instinct in the matter is right．“Let the naturalists”，he says，“explain these things，and the reason and manner of them；all I can say to them is，to describe the fact .... ”If you are Defoe，certainly to describe the fact is enough；for the fact is the right fact．By means of this genius for fact Defoe achieves effects that are beyond any but the great masters of descriptive prose．He has only to say a word or two about“the grey of the morning”to paint vividly a windy dawn．A sense of desolation and of the deaths of many men is conveyed by remarking in the most prosaic way in the world，“I never saw them afterwards，or any sign of them except three of their hats，one cap，and two shoes that were not fellows”．When at last he exclaims，“Then to see how like a king I din'd too all alone，attended by my servants”— his parrot and his dog and his two cats，we cannot help but feel that all humanity is on a desert island alone — though Defoe at once informs us，for he has a way of snubbing off our enthusiasms，that the cats were not the same cats that had come in the ship．Both of those were dead；these cats were new cats，and as a matter of fact cats became very troublesome before long from their fecundity，whereas dogs，oddly enough，did not breed at all．

Thus Defoe，by reiterating that nothing but a plain earthenware pot stands in the foreground，persuades us to see remote islands and the solitudes of the human soul．By believing fixedly in the solidity of the pot and its earthiness，he has subdued every other element to his design；he has roped the whole universe into harmony．And is there any reason，we ask as we shut the book，why the perspective that a plain earthenware pot exacts should not satisfy us as completely，once we grasp it，as man himself in all his sublimity standing against a background of broken mountains and tumbling oceans with stars flaming in the sky？





Dorothy Osborne's“Letters”


It must sometimes strike the casual reader of English literature that there is a bare season in it，sometimes like early spring in our country-side．The trees stand out；the hills are unmuffled in green；there is nothing to obscure the mass of the earth or the lines of the branches．But we miss the tremor and murmur of June，when the smallest wood seems full of movement，and one has only to stand still to hear the whispering and the pattering of nimble，inquisitive animals going about their affairs in the undergrowth．so in English literature we have to wait till the sixteenth century is over and the seventeenth well on its way before the bare landscape becomes full of stir and quiver and we can fill in the spaces between the great books with the voices of people talking．

Doubtless great changes in psychology were needed and great changes in material comfort — arm-chairs and carpets and good roads — before it was possible for human beings to watch each other curiously or to communicate their thoughts easily．And it may be that our early literature owes something of its magnificence to the fact that writing was an uncommon art，practised，rather for fame than for money，by those whose gifts compelled them．Perhaps the dissipation of our genius in biography，and journalism，and letter-and memoir-writing has weakened its strength in any one direction．However this may be，there is a bareness about an age that has neither letter-writers nor biographers．Lives and characters appear in stark outline．Donne，says Sir Edmund Gosse，is inscrutable；and that is largely because，though we know what Donne thought of Lady Bedford，we have not the slightest inkling what Lady Bedford thought of Donne．She had no friend to whom she described the effect of that strange visitor；nor，had she had a confidante，could she have explained for what reasons Donne seemed to her strange．

And the conditions that made it impossible for Boswell or Horace Walpole to be born in the sixteenth century were obviously likely to fall with far heavier force upon the other sex．Besides the material difficulty — Donne's small house at Mitcham with its thin walls and crying children typifies the discomfort in which the Elizabethans lived — the woman was impeded also by her belief that writing was an act unbefitting her sex．A great lady here and there whose rank secured her the toleration and it may be the adulation of a servile circle，might write and print her writings．But the act was offensive to a woman of lower rank．“Sure the poore woman is a little distracted，she could never bee soe ridiculous else as to venture writeing book's and in verse too”，Dorothy Osborne exclaimed when the Duchess of Newcastle published one of her books．For her own part，she added，“If I could not sleep this fortnight I should not come to that”．And the comment is the more illuminating in that it was made by a woman of great literary gift．Had she been born in 1827，Dorothy Osborne would have written novels；had she been born in 1527，she would never have written at all．But she was born in 1627，and at that date though writing books was ridiculous for a woman there was nothing unseemly in writing a letter．And so by degrees the silence is broken；we begin to hear rustlings in the undergrowth；for the first time in English literature we hear men and women talking together over the fire．

But the art of letter-writing in its infancy was not the art that has since filled so many delightful volumes．Men and women were ceremoniously Sir and Madam；the language was still too rich and stiff to turn and twist quickly and freely upon half a sheet of notepaper．The art of letter-writing is often the art of essay-writing in disguise．But such as it was，it was an art that a woman could practise without unsexing herself．It was an art that could be carried on at odd moments，by a father's sick-bed，among a thousand interruptions，without exciting comment，anonymously as it were，and often with the pretence that it served some useful purpose．Yet into these innumerable Letters，lost now for the most part，went powers of observation and of wit that were later to take rather a different shape in Evelina and in Pride and Prejudice．They were only Letters，yet some pride went to their making．Dorothy，without admitting it，took pains with her own writing and had views as to the nature of it：“... great Schollers are not the best writer's（of Letters I mean，of books perhaps they are） ... all Letters mee thinks should be free and easy as one's discourse”．She was in agreement with an old uncle of hers who threw his standish at his secretary's head for saying“put pen to paper”instead of simply“wrote”．Yet there were limits，she reflected，to free-and-easiness：“... many pritty things shuffled together”do better spoken than in a letter．And so we come by a form of literature，if Dorothy Osborne will let us call it so，which is distinct from any other，and much to be regretted now that it has gone from us，as it seems，for ever．

For Dorothy Osborne，as she filled her great sheets by her father's bed or by the chimney-corner，gave a record of life，gravely yet playfully，formally yet with intimacy，to a public of one，but to a fastidious public，as the novelist can never give it，or the historian either．Since it is her business to keep her lover informed of what passes in her home，she must sketch the solemn Sir Justinian Isham — Sir solomon Justinian，she calls him — the pompous widower with four daughters and a great gloomy house in Northamptonshire who wished to marry her．“Lord what would I give that I had a Lattin letter of his for you”，she exclaimed，in which he describes her to an Oxford friend and specially commended her that she was“capable of being company and conversation for him”；she must sketch her valetudinarian Cousin Molle waking one morning in fear of the dropsy and hurrying to the doctor at Cambridge；she must draw her own picture wandering in the garden at night and smelling the“Jessomin”，“and yet I was not pleased”because Temple was not with her．Any gossip that comes her way is sent on to amuse her lover．Lady Sunderland，for instance，has condescended to marry plain Mr．Smith，who treats her like a princess，which Sir Justinian thinks a bad precedent for wives．But Lady Sunderland tells everyone she married him out of pity，and that，Dorothy comments，“was the pittyfull'st sayeing that ever I heard”．soon we have picked up enough about all her friends to snatch eagerly at any further addition to the picture which is forming in our mind's eye．

Indeed，our glimpse of the society of Bedfordshire in the seventeenth century is the more intriguing for its intermittency．In they come and out they go — Sir Justinian and Lady Diana，Mr．Smith and his countess — and we never know when or whether we shall hear of them again．But with all this haphazardry，the Letters，like the Letters of all born letter-writers，provide their own continuity．They make us feel that we have our seat in the depths of Dorothy's mind，at the heart of the pageant which unfolds itself page by page as we read．For she possesses indisputably the gift which counts for more in letter-writing than wit or brilliance or traffic with great people．By being herself without effort or emphasis，she envelops all these odds and ends in the flow of her own personality．It was a character that was both attractive and a little obscure．Phrase by phrase we come closer into touch with it．Of the womanly virtues that befitted her age she shows little trace．She says nothing of sewing or baking．She was a little indolent by temperament．She browsed casually on vast French romances．She roams the commons，loitering to hear the milkmaids sing；she walks in the garden by the side of a small river，“where I sitt downe and wish you were with mee”．She was apt to fall silent in company and dream over the fire till some talk of flying，perhaps，roused her，and she made her brother laugh by asking what they were saying about flying，for the thought had struck her，if she could fly she could be with Temple．Gravity，melancholy were in her blood．She looked，her mother used to say，as if all her friends were dead．She is oppressed by a sense of fortune and its tyranny and the vanity of things and the uselessness of effort．Her mother and sister were grave women too，the sister famed for her Letters，but fonder of books than of company，the mother“counted as wise a woman as most in England”，but sardonic．“I have lived to see that 'tis almost impossible to think People worse than they are and soe will you”— Dorothy could remember her mother saying that．To assuage her spleen，Dorothy herself had to visit the wells at Epsom and to drink water that steel had stood in．

With such a temperament her humour naturally took the form of irony rather than of wit．She loved to mock her lover and to pour a fine raillery over the pomps and ceremonies of existence．Pride of birth she laughed at．Pompous old men were fine subjects for her satire．A dull sermon moved her to laughter．She saw through parties；she saw through ceremonies；she saw through worldliness and display．But with all this clearsightedness there was something that she did not see through．She dreaded with a shrinking that was scarcely sane the ridicule of the world．The meddling of aunts and the tyranny of brothers exasperated her．“I would live in a hollow Tree”，she said，“to avoyde them．”A husband kissing his wife in public seemed to her as“ill a sight as one would wish to see”．Though she cared no more whether people praised her beauty or her wit than whether“they think my name Eliz：or Dor：”，a word of gossip about her own behaviour would set her in a quiver．Thus when it came to proving before the eyes of the world that she loved a poor man and was prepared to marry him，she could not do it．“I confess that I have an humor that will not suffer mee to Expose myself to People's Scorne”，she wrote．She could be“sattisfyed within as narrow a compasse as that of any person liveing of my rank”，but ridicule was intolerable to her．She shrank from any extravagance that could draw the censure of the world upon her．It was a weakness for which Temple had sometimes to reprove her．

For Temple's character emerges more and more clearly as the Letters go on — it is a proof of Dorothy's gift as a correspondent．A good letter-writer so takes the colour of the reader at the other end，that from reading the one we can imagine the other．As she argues，as she reasons，we hear Temple almost as clearly as we hear Dorothy herself．He was in many ways the opposite of her．He drew out her melancholy by rebutting it；he made her defend her dislike of marriage by opposing it．Of the two Temple was by far the more robust and positive．Yet there was perhaps something — a little hardness，a little conceit — that justified her brother's dislike of him．He called Temple the“proudest imperious insulting ill-natured man that ever was”．But，in the eyes of Dorothy，Temple had qualities that none of her other suitors possessed．He was not a mere country gentleman，nor a pompous Justice of the Peace，nor a town gallant，making love to every woman he met，nor a travelled Monsieur；for had he been any one of these things，Dorothy，with her quick sense of the ridiculous，would have had none of him．To her he had some charm，some sympathy，that the others lacked；she could write to him whatever came into her head；she was at her best with him；she loved him；she respected him．Yet suddenly she declared that marry him she would not．She turned violently against marriage indeed，and cited failure after failure．If people knew each other before marriage，she thought，there would be an end of it．Passion was the most brutish and tyrannical of all our senses．Passion had made Lady Anne Blount the“talk of all the footmen and Boy's in the street”．Passion had been the undoing of the lovely Lady Izabella — what use was her beauty now married to“that beast with all his estate”？Torn asunder by her brother's anger，by Temple's jealousy，and by her own dread of ridicule，she wished for nothing but to be left to find“an early and a quiet grave”．That Temple overcame her scruples and overrode her brother's opposition is much to the credit of his character．Yet it is an act that we can hardly help deploring．Married to Temple，she wrote to him no longer．The Letters almost immediately cease．The whole world that Dorothy had brought into existence is extinguished．It is then that we realise how round and populous and stirring that world has become．Under the warmth of her affection for Temple the stiffness had gone out of her pen．Writing half asleep by her father's side，snatching the back of an old letter to write upon，she had come to write easily though always with the dignity proper to that age，of the Lady Dianas，and the Ishams，of the aunts and the uncles — how they come，how they go；what they say；whether she finds them dull，laughable，charming，or much as usual．More than that，she has suggested，writing her mind out to Temple，the deeper relationships，the more private moods，that gave her life its conflict and its consolation — her brother's tyranny；her own moodiness and melancholy；the sweetness of walking in the garden at night；of sitting lost in thought by the river；of longing for a letter and finding one．All this is around us；we are deep in this world，seizing its hints and suggestions when，in the moment，the scene is blotted out．She married，and her husband was a rising diplomat．She had to follow his fortunes in Brussels，at The Hague，wherever they called him．Seven children were born and seven children died“almost all in their cradle”．Innumerable duties and responsibilities fell to the lot of the girl who had made fun of pomp and ceremony，who loved privacy and had wished to live secluded out of the world and“grow old together in our little cottage”．Now she was mistress of her husband's house at The Hague with its splendid buffet of plate．She was his confidante in the many troubles of his difficult career．She stayed behind in London to negotiate if possible the payment of his arrears of salary．When her yacht was fired on，she behaved，the King said，with greater courage than the captain himself．She was everything that the wife of an ambassador should be：she was everything，too，that the wife of a man retired from the public service should be．And troubles came upon them — a daughter died；a son，inheriting perhaps his mother's melancholy，filled his boots with stones and leapt into the Thames．so the years passed；very full，very active，very troubled．But Dorothy maintained her silence．

At last，however，a strange young man came to Moor Park as secretary to her husband．He was difficult，ill-mannered，and quick to take offence．But it is through Swift's eyes that we see Dorothy once more in the last years of her life．“Mild Dorothea，peaceful，wise，and great”，Swift called her；but the light falls upon a ghost．We do not know that silent lady．We cannot connect her after all these years with the girl who poured her heart out to her lover．“Peaceful，wise，and great”— she was none of those things when we last met her，and much though we honour the admirable ambassadress who made her husband's career her own，there are moments when we would exchange all the benefits of the Triple Alliance and all the glories of the Treaty of Nimuegen for the Letters that Dorothy did not write．





Swift's“Journal to Stella”


In any highly civilised society disguise plays so large a part，politeness is so essential，that to throw off the ceremonies and conventions and talk a“little language”for one or two to understand，is as much a necessity as a breath of air in a hot room．The reserved，the powerful，the admired，have the most need of such a refuge．Swift himself found it so．The proudest of men coming home from the company of great men who praised him，of lovely women who flattered him，from intrigue and politics，put all that aside，settled himself comfortably in bed，pursed his severe lips into baby language and prattled to his“two monkies”，his“dear Sirrahs”，his“naughty rogues”on the other side of the Irish Channel．

Well，let me see you now again．My wax candle's almost out，but however I'll begin．Well then don't be so tedious，Mr．Presto；what can you say to MD's letter？Make haste，have done with your preambles — why，I say，I am glad you are so often abroad．

So long as Swift wrote to Stella in that strain，carelessly，illegibly，for“methinks when I write plain，I do not know how，but we are not alone，all the world can see us．A bad scrawl is so snug ... ”，Stella had no need to be jealous．It was true that she was wearing away the flower of her youth in Ireland with Rebecca Dingley，who wore hinged spectacles，consumed large quantities of Brazil tobacco，and stumbled over her petticoats as she walked．Further，the conditions in which the two ladies lived，for ever in Swift's company when he was at home，occupying his house when he was absent，gave rise to gossip；so that though Stella never saw him except in Mrs．Dingley's presence，she was one of those ambiguous women who live chiefly in the society of the other sex．But surely it was well worth while．The packets kept coming from England，each sheet written to the rim in Swift's crabbed little hand，which she imitated to perfection，full of nonsense words，and capital Letters，and hints which no one but Stella could understand，and secrets which Stella was to keep，and little commissions which Stella was to execute．Tobacco came for Dingley，and chocolate and silk aprons for Stella．Whatever people might say，surely it was well worth while．

Of this Presto，who was so different from that formidable character“t'other I”，the world knew nothing．The world knew only that Swift was over in England again，soliciting the new Torv government on behalf of the Irish Church for those First Fruits which he had begged the Whigs in vain to restore．The business was soon accomplished；nothing indeed could exceed the cordiality and affection with which Harley and St．John greeted him；and now the world saw what even in those days of small societies and individual pre-eminence must have been a sight to startle and amaze — the“mad parson”，who had marched up and down the coffee-houses in silence and unknown a few years ago，admitted to the inmost councils of State；the penniless boy who was not allowed to sit down at table with Sir William Temple dining with the highest Ministers of the Crown，making dukes do his bidding，and so run after for his good offices that his servant's chief duty was to know how to keep people out．Addison himself forced his way up only by pretending that he was a gentleman come to pay a bill．For the time being Swift was omnipotent．Nobody could buy his services；everybody feared his pen．He went to Court，and“am so proud I make all the lords come up to me”．The Queen wished to hear him preach；Harley and St．John added their entreaties；but he refused．When Mr．Secretary one night dared show his temper，Swift called upon him and warned him

Never to appear cold to me，for I would not be treated like a schoolboy .... He took all right；said I had reason ... would have had me dine with him at Mrs．Masham's brother，to make up matters；but I would not．I don't know，but I would not．

He scribbled all this down to Stella without exultation or vanity．That he should command and dictate，prove himself the peer of great men and make rank abase itself before him，called for no comment on his part or on hers．Had she not known him years ago at Moor Park and seen him lose his temper with Sir William Temple，and guessed his greatness and heard from his own lips what he planned and hoped？Did she not know better than anyone how strangely good and bad were blent in him and all his foibles and eccentricities of temper？He scandalised the lords with whom he dined by his stinginess，picked the coals off his fire，saved halfpence on coaches；and yet by the help of these very economies he practised，she knew，the most considerate and secret of charities — he gave poor Patty Rolt“a pistole to help her a little forward against she goes to board in the country”；he took twenty guineas to young Harrison，the sick poet，in his garret．She alone knew how he could be coarse in his speech and yet delicate in his behaviour；how he could be cynical superficially and yet cherish a depth of feeling which she had never met with in any other human being．They knew each other in and out；the good and the bad，the deep and the trivial；so that without effort or concealment he could use those precious moments late at night or the first thing on waking to pour out upon her the whole story of his day，with its charities and meannesses，its affections and ambitions and despairs，as though he were thinking aloud．

With such proof of his affection，admitted to intimacy with this Presto whom no one else in the world knew，Stella had no cause to be jealous．It was perhaps the opposite that happened．As she read the crowded pages，she could see him and hear him and imagine so exactly the impression that he must be making on all these fine people that she fell more deeply in love with him than ever．Not only was he courted and flattered by the great；everybody seemed to call upon him when they were in trouble．There was“young Harrison”；he worried to find him ill and penniless；carried him off to Knightsbridge；took him a hundred pounds only to find that he was dead an hour before．“Think what grief this is to me！ ... I could not dine with Lord Treasurer，nor anywhere else；but got a bit of meat toward evening．”She could imagine the strange scene，that November morning，when the Duke of Hamilton was killed in Hyde Park，and Swift went at once to the Duchess and sat with her for two hours and heard her rage and storm and rail；and took her affairs，too，on his shoulders as if it were his natural office，and none could dispute his place in the house of mourning．“She has moved my very soul”，he said．When young Lady Ashburnham died he burst out，“I hate life when I think it exposed to such accidents；and to see so many thousand wretches burdening the earth，while such as her die，makes me think God did never intend life for a blessing”．And then，with that instinct to rend and tear his own emotions which made him angry in the midst of his pity，he would round upon the mourners，even the mother and sister of the dead woman，and part them as they cried together and complain how“people will pretend to grieve more than they really do，and that takes off from their true grief”．

All this was poured forth freely to Stella；the gloom and the anger，the kindness and the coarseness and the genial love of little ordinary human things．To her he showed himself fatherly and brotherly；he laughed at her spelling；he scolded her about her health；he directed her business affairs．He gossiped and chatted with her．They had a fund of memories in common．They had spent many happy hours together．“Do not you remember I used to come into your chamber and turn Stella out of her chair，and rake up the fire in a cold morning and cry uth，uth，uth！”She was often in his mind；he wondered if she was out walking when he was；when Prior abused one of his puns he remembered Stella's puns and how vile they were；he compared his life in London with hers in Ireland and wondered when they would be together again．And if this was the influence of Stella upon Swift in town among all the wits，the influence of Swift upon Stella marooned in an Irish village alone with Dingley was far greater．He had taught her all the little learning she had when she was a child and he a young man years ago at Moor Park．His influence was everywhere — upon her mind，upon her affections，upon the books she read and the hand she wrote，upon the friends she made and the suitors she rejected．Indeed，he was half responsible for her being．

But the woman he had chosen was no insipid slave．She had a character of her own．She was capable of thinking for herself．She was aloof，a severe critic for all her grace and sympathy，a little formidable perhaps with her love of plain speaking and her fiery temper and her fearlessness in saying what she thought．But with all her gifts she was little known．Her slender means and feeble health and dubious social standing made her way of life very modest．The society which gathered round her came for the simple pleasure of talking to a woman who listened and understood and said very little herself，but in the most agreeable of voices and generally“the best thing that was said in the company”．For the rest she was not learned．Her health had prevented her from serious study，and though she had run over a great variety of subjects and had a fine severe taste in Letters，what she did read did not stick in her mind．She had been extravagant as a girl，and flung her money about until her good sense took control of her，and now she lived with the utmost frugality．“Five nothings on five plates of delf”made her supper．Attractive，if not beautiful，with her fine dark eyes and her raven black hair，she dressed very plainly，and thus contrived to lay by enough to help the poor and to bestow upon her friends（it was an extravagance that she could not resist）“the most agreeable presents in the world”．Swift never knew her equal in that art，“although it be an affair of as delicate a nature as most in the course of life”．She had in addition that sincerity which Swift called“honour”，and in spite of the weakness of her body“the personal courage of a hero”．Once when a robber came to her window，she had shot him through the body with her own hand．Such，then，was the influence which worked on Swift as he wrote；such the presence that mingled with the thought of his fruit trees and the willows and the trout stream at Laracor when he saw the trees budding in St．James's Park and heard the politicians wrangle at Westminster．Unknown to all of them，he had his retreat；and if the Ministers again played him false，and once more，after making his friend's fortunes，he went empty-handed away，then after all he could retire to Ireland and to Stella and have“no shuddering at all”at the thought．

But Stella was the last woman in the world to press her claims．None knew better than she that Swift loved power and the company of men：that though he had his moods of tenderness and his fierce spasms of disgust at society，still for the most part he infinitely preferred the dust and bustle of London to all the trout streams and cherry trees in the world．Above all，he hated interference．If anyone laid a finger upon his liberty or hinted the least threat to his independence，were they men or women，queens or kitchen-maids，he turned upon them with a ferocity which made a savage of him on the spot．Harley once dared to offer him a bank-note；Miss Waring dared hint that the obstacles to their marriage were now removed．Both were chastised，the woman brutally．But Stella knew better than to invite such treatment．Stella had learnt patience；Stella had learnt discretion．Even in a matter like this of staying in London or coming back to Ireland she allowed him every latitude．She asked nothing for herself and therefore got more than she asked．Swift was half annoyed：

... your generosity makes me mad；I know you repine inwardly at Presto's absence；you think he has broken his word，of coming in three months，and that this is always his trick：and now Stella says，she does not see possibly how I can come away in haste，and that MD is satisfied，etc．An't you a rogue to overpower me thus？

But it was thus that she kept him．Again and again he burst into language of intense affection：

Farewell dear Sirrahs，dearest lives：there is peace and quiet with MD，and nowhere else .... Farewell again，dearest rogues：I am never happy，but when I write or think of MD .... You are as welcome as my blood to every farthing I have in the world：and all that grieves me is，I am not richer，for MD's sake．

One thing alone dashed the pleasure that such words gave her．It was always in the plural that he spoke of her；it was always“dearest Sirrahs，dearest lives”；MD stood for Stella and Mrs．Dingley together．Swift and Stella were never alone．Grant that this was for form's sake merely，grant that the presence of Mrs．Dingley，busy with her keys and her lapdog and never listening to a word that was said to her，was a form too．But why should such forms be necessary？Why impose a strain that wasted her health and half spoilt her pleasure and kept“perfect friends”who were happy only in each other's company apart？Why indeed？There was a reason；a secret that Stella knew；a secret that Stella did not impart．Divided they had to be．Since，then，no bond bound them，since she was afraid to lay the least claim upon her friend，all the more jealously must she have searched into his words and analysed his conduct to ascertain the temper of his mood and acquaint herself instantly with the least change in it．so long as he told her frankly of his“favourites”and showed himself the bluff tyrant who required every woman to make advances to him，who lectured fine ladies and let them tease him，all was well．There was nothing in that to rouse her suspicions．Lady Berkeley might steal his hat；the Duchess of Hamilton might lay bare her agony；and Stella，who was kind to her sex，laughed with the one and grieved with the other．

But were there traces in the Journal of a different sort of influence — something far more dangerous because more equal and more intimate？Suppose that there were some woman of Swift's own station，a girl，like the girl that Stella herself had been when Swift first knew her，dissatisfied with the ordinary way of life，eager，as Stella put it，to know right from wrong，gifted，witty，and untaught — she indeed，if she existed，might be a rival to be feared．But was there such a rival？If so，it was plain that there would be no mention of her in the Journal．Instead，there would be hesitations，excuses，an occasional uneasiness and embarrassment when，in the midst of writing freely and fully，Swift was brought to a stop by something that he could not say．Indeed，he had only been a month or two in England when some such silence roused Stella's suspicions．Who was it，she asked，that boarded near him，that he dined with now and then？“I know no such person，”Swift replied；“I do not dine with boarders．What the pox！ You know whom I have dined with every day since I left you，better than I do．What do you mean，Sirrah？”But he knew what she meant：she meant Mrs．Vanhomrigh，the widow who lived near him；she meant her daughter Esther．“The Vans”kept coming again and again after that in the Journal．Swift was too proud to conceal the fact that he saw them，but he sought nine times out of ten to excuse it．When he was in Suffolk Street the Vanhomrighs were in St．James's Street and thus saved him a walk．When he was in Chelsea they were in London，and it was convenient to keep his best gown and periwig there．sometimes the heat kept him there and sometimes the rain；now they were playing cards，and young Lady Ashburnham reminded him so much of Stella that he stayed on to help her．sometimes he stayed out of listlessness；again he stayed because he was very busy and they were simple people who did not stand on ceremony．At the same time Stella had only to hint that these Vanhomrighs were people of no consequence for him to retort，“Why，they keep as good female company as I do male .... I saw two lady Bettys there this afternoon．”In short，to tell the whole truth，to write whatever came into his head in the old free way，was no longer easy．

Indeed，the whole situation was full of difficulty．No man detested falsehood more than Swift or loved truth more whole-heartedly．Yet here he was compelled to hedge，to hide，and to prevaricate．Again，it had become essential to him to have some“sluttery”or private chamber where he could relax and unbend and be Presto and not“t'other I”．Stella satisfied this need as no one else could．But then Stella was in Ireland；Vanessa was on the spot．She was younger and fresher；she too had her charms．She too could be taught and improved and scolded into maturity as Stella had been．Obviously Swift's influence upon her was all to the good．And so with Stella in Ireland and Vanessa in London，why should it not be possible to enjoy what each could give him，confer benefits on both and do no serious harm to either？It seemed possible；at any rate he allowed himself to make the experiment．Stella，after all，had contrived for many years to make shift with her portion；Stella had never complained of her lot．

But Vanessa was not Stella．She was younger，more vehement，less disciplined，less wise．She had no Mrs．Dingley to restrain her．She had no memories of the past to solace her．She had no journals coming day by day to comfort her．She loved Swift and she knew no reason why she should not say so．Had he not himself taught her“to act what was right，and not to mind what the world said”？Thus when some obstacle impeded her，when some mysterious secret came between them，she had the unwisdom to question him．“Pray what can be wrong in seeing and advising an unhappy young woman？I can't imagine．”“You have taught me to distinguish，”she burst out，“and then you leave me miserable．”Finally in her anguish and her bewilderment she had the temerity to force herself upon Stella．She wrote and demanded to be told the truth — what was Stella's connexion with Swift？But it was Swift himself who enlightened her．And when the full force of those bright blue eyes blazed upon her，when he flung her letter on the table and glared at her and said nothing and rode off，her life was ended．It was no figure of speech when she said that“his killing，killing words”were worse than the rack to her；when she cried out that there was“something in your look so awful that it strikes me dumb”．Within a few weeks of that interview she was dead；she had vanished，to become one of those uneasy ghosts who haunted the troubled background of Stella's life，peopling its solitude with fears．

Stella was left to enjoy her intimacy alone．She lived on to practise those sad arts by which she kept her friend at her side until，worn out with the strain and the concealment，with Mrs．Dingley and her lap-dogs，with the perpetual fears and frustrations，she too died．As they buried her，Swift sat in a back room away from the lights in the churchyard and wrote an account of the character of“the truest，most virtuous，and valuable friend，that I，or perhaps any other person，was ever blessed with”．Years passed；insanity overcame him；he exploded in violent outbursts of mad rage．Then by degrees he fell silent．Once they caught him murmuring．“I am what I am”，they heard him say．





Modern Fiction


In making any survey，even the freest and loosest，of modern fiction，it is difficult not to take it for granted that the modern practice of the art is somehow an improvement upon the old．With their simple tools and primitive materials，it might be said，Fielding did well and Jane Austen even better，but compare their opportunities with ours！ Their masterpieces certainly have a strange air of simplicity．And yet the analogy between literature and the process，to choose an example，of making motor cars scarcely holds good beyond the first glance．It is doubtful whether in the course of the centuries，though we have learnt much about making machines，we have learnt anything about making literature．We do not come to write better；all that we can be said to do is to keep moving，now a little in this direction，now in that，but with a circular tendency should the whole course of the track be viewed from a sufficiently lofty pinnacle．It need scarcely be said that we make no claim to stand，even momentarily，upon that vantage ground．On the flat，in the crowd，half blind with dust，we look back with envy to those happier warriors，whose battle is won and whose achievements wear so serene an air of accomplishment that we can scarcely refrain from whispering that the fight was not so fierce for them as for us．It is for the historian of literature to decide；for him to say if we are now beginning or ending or standing in the middle of a great period of prose fiction，for down in the plain little is visible．We only know that certain gratitudes and hostilities inspire us；that certain paths seem to lead to fertile land，others to the dust and the desert；and of this perhaps it may be worth while to attempt some account．

Our quarrel，then，is not with the classics，and if we speak of quarrelling with Mr．Wells，Mr．Bennett，and Mr．Galsworthy，it is partly that by the mere fact of their existence in the flesh their work has a living，breathing，everyday imperfection which bids us take what liberties with it we choose．But it is also true that，while we thank them for a thousand gifts，we reserve our unconditional gratitude for Mr．Hardy，for Mr．Conrad，and in a much lesser degree for the Mr．Hudson of The Purple Land，Green Mansions，and Far Away and Long Ago．Mr．Wells，Mr．Bennett，and Mr．Galsworthy have excited so many hopes and disappointed them so persistently that our gratitude largely takes the form of thanking them for having shown us what they might have done but have not done；what we certainly could not do，but as certainly，perhaps，do not wish to do．No single phrase will sum up the charge or grievance which we have to bring against a mass of work so large in its volume and embodying so many qualities，both admirable and the reverse．If we tried to formulate our meaning in one word we should say that these three writers are materialists．It is because they are concerned not with the spirit but with the body that they have disappointed us，and left us with the feeling that the sooner English fiction turns its back upon them，as politely as may be，and marches，if only into the desert，the better for its soul．Naturally，no single word reaches the centre of three separate targets．In the case of Mr．Wells it falls notably wide of the mark．And yet even with him it indicates to our thinking the fatal alloy in his genius，the great clod of clay that has got itself mixed up with the purity of his inspiration．But Mr．Bennett is perhaps the worst culprit of the three，inasmuch as he is by far the best workman．He can make a book so well constructed and solid in its craftsmanship that it is difficult for the most exacting of critics to see through what chink or crevice decay can creep in．There is not so much as a draught between the frames of the windows，or a crack in the boards．And yet — if life should refuse to live there？That is a risk which the creator of The Old Wives' Tale，George Cannon，Edwin Clayhanger，and hosts of other figures，may well claim to have surmounted．His characters live abundantly，even unexpectedly，but it remains to ask how do they live，and what do they live for？More and more they seem to us，deserting even the well-built villa in the Five Towns，to spend their time in some softly padded first-class railway carriage，pressing bells and buttons innumerable；and the destiny to which they travel so luxuriously becomes more and more unquestionably an eternity of bliss spent in the very best hotel in Brighton．It can scarcely be said of Mr．Wells that he is a materialist in the sense that he takes too much delight in the solidity of his fabric．His mind is too generous in its sympathies to allow him to spend much time in making things shipshape and substantial．He is a materialist from sheer goodness of heart，taking upon his shoulders the work that ought to have been discharged by Government officials，and in the plethora of his ideas and facts scarcely having leisure to realise，or forgetting to think important，the crudity and coarseness of his human beings．Yet what more damaging criticism can there be both of his earth and of his Heaven than that they are to be inhabited here and hereafter by his Joans and his Peters？Does not the inferiority of their natures tarnish whatever institutions and ideals may be provided for them by the generosity of their creator？Nor，profoundly though we respect the integrity and humanity of Mr．Galsworthy，shall we find what we seek in his pages．

If we fasten，then，one label on all these books，on which is one word materialists，we mean by it that they write of unimportant things；that they spend immense skill and immense industry making the trivial and the transitory appear the true and the enduring．

We have to admit that we are exacting，and，further，that we find it difficult to justify our discontent by explaining what it is that we exact．We frame our question differently at different times．But it reappears most persistently as we drop the finished novel on the crest of a sigh — Is it worth while？What is the point of it all？Can it be that，owing to one of those little deviations which the human spirit seems to make from time to time，Mr．Bennett has come down with his magnificent apparatus for catching life just an inch or two on the wrong side？Life escapes；and perhaps without life nothing else is worth while．It is a confession of vagueness to have to make use of such a figure as this，but we scarcely better the matter by speaking，as critics are prone to do，of reality．Admitting the vagueness which afflicts all criticism of novels，let us hazard the opinion that for us at this moment the form of fiction most in vogue more often misses than secures the thing we seek．Whether we call it life or spirit，truth or reality，this，the essential thing，has moved off，or on，and refuses to be contained any longer in such ill-fitting vestments as we provide．Nevertheless，we go on perseveringly，conscientiously，constructing our two and thirty chapters after a design which more and more ceases to resemble the vision in our minds．so much of the enormous labour of proving the solidity，the likeness to life，of the story is not merely labour thrown away but labour misplaced to the extent of obscuring and blotting out the light of the conception．The writer seems constrained，not by his own free will but by some powerful and unscrupulous tyrant who has him in thrall，to provide a plot，to provide comedy，tragedy，love interest，and an air of probability embalming the whole so impeccable that if all his figures were to come to life they would find themselves dressed down to the last button of their coats in the fashion of the hour．The tyrant is obeyed；the novel is done to a turn．But sometimes，more and more often as time goes by，we suspect a momentary doubt，a spasm of rebellion，as the pages fill themselves in the customary way．Is life like this？Must novels be like this？

Look within and life，it seems，is very far from being“like this”．Examine for a moment an ordinary mind on an ordinary day．The mind receives a myriad impressions — trivial，fantastic，evanescent，or engraved with the sharpness of steel．From all sides they come，an incessant shower of innumerable atoms；and as they fall，as they shape themselves into the life of Monday or Tuesday，the accent falls differently from of old；the moment of importance came not here but there；so that，if a writer were a free man and not a slave，if he could write what he chose，not what he must，if he could base his work upon his own feeling and not upon convention，there would be no plot，no comedy，no tragedy，no love interest or catastrophe in the accepted style，and perhaps not a single button sewn on as the Bond Street tailors would have it．Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged；life is a luminous halo，a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end．Is it not the task of the novelist to convey this varying，this unknown and uncircumscribed spirit，whatever aberration or complexity it may display，with as little mixture of the alien and external as possible？We are not pleading merely for courage and sincerity；we are suggesting that the proper stuff of fiction is a little other than custom would have us believe it．

It is，at any rate，in some such fashion as this that we seek to define the quality which distinguishes the work of several young writers，among whom Mr．James Joyce is the most notable，from that of their predecessors．They attempt to come closer to life，and to preserve more sincerely and exactly what interests and moves them，even if to do so they must discard most of the conventions which are commonly observed by the novelist．Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall，let us trace the pattern，however disconnected and incoherent in appearance，which each sight or incident scores upon the consciousness．Let us not take it for granted that life exists more fully in what is commonly thought big than in what is commonly thought small．Any one who has read The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man or，what promises to be a far more interesting work，Ulysses，now appearing in the Little Review，will have hazarded some theory of this nature as to Mr．Joyce's intention．On our part，with such a fragment before us，it is hazarded rather than affirmed；but whatever the intention of the whole，there can be no question but that it is of the utmost sincerity and that the result，difficult or unpleasant as we may judge it，is undeniably important．In contrast with those whom we have called materialists，Mr．Joyce is spiritual；he is concerned at all costs to reveal the flickerings of that innermost flame which flashes its messages through the brain，and in order to preserve it he disregards with complete courage whatever seems to him adventitious，whether it be probability，or coherence，or any other of these signposts which for generations have served to support the imagination of a reader when called upon to imagine what he can neither touch nor see．The scene in the cemetery，for instance，with its brilliancy，its sordidity，its incoherence，its sudden lightning flashes of significance，does undoubtedly come so close to the quick of the mind that，on a first reading at any rate，it is difficult not to acclaim a masterpiece．If we want life itself，here surely we have it．Indeed，we find ourselves fumbling rather awkwardly if we try to say what else we wish，and for what reason a work of such originality yet fails to compare，for we must take high examples，with Youth or The Mayor of Casterbridge．It fails because of the comparative poverty of the writer's mind，we might say simply and have done with it．But it is possible to press a little further and wonder whether we may not refer our sense of being in a bright yet narrow room，confined and shut in，rather than enlarged and set free，to some limitation imposed by the method as well as by the mind．Is it the method that inhibits the creative power？Is it due to the method that we feel neither jovial nor magnanimous，but centred in a self which，in spite of its tremor of susceptibility，never embraces or creates what is outside itself and beyond？Does the emphasis laid，perhaps didactically，upon indecency，contribute to the effect of something angular and isolated？or is it merely that in any effort of such originality it is much easier，for contemporaries especially，to feel what it lacks than to name what it gives？In any case it is a mistake to stand outside examining“methods”．Any method is right，every method is right，that expresses what we wish to express，if we are writers；that brings us closer to the novelist's intention if we are readers．This method has the merit of bringing us closer to what we were prepared to call life itself；did not the reading of Ulysses suggest how much of life is excluded or ignored，and did it not come with a shock to open Tristram Shandy or even Pendennis and be by them convinced that there are not only other aspects of life，but more important ones into the bargain．

However this may be，the problem before the novelist at present，as we suppose it to have been in the past，is to contrive means of being free to set down what he chooses．He has to have the courage to say that what interests him is no longer“this”but“that”：out of“that”alone must he construct his work．For the moderns“that”，the point of interest，lies very likely in the dark places of psychology．At once，therefore，the accent falls a little differently；the emphasis is upon something hitherto ignored；at once a different outline of form becomes necessary，difficult for us to grasp，incomprehensible to our predecessors．No one but a modern，no one perhaps but a Russian，would have felt the interest of the situation which Chekhov has made into the short story which he calls“Gusev”．some Russian soldiers lie ill on board a ship which is taking them back to Russia．We are given a few scraps of their talk and some of their thoughts；then one of them dies and is carried away；the talk goes on among the others for a time，until Gusev himself dies，and looking“like a carrot or a radish”is thrown overboard．The emphasis is laid upon such unexpected places that at first it seems as if there were no emphasis at all；and then，as the eyes accustom themselves to twilight and discern the shapes of things in a room we see how complete the story is，how profound，and how truly in obedience to his vision Chekhov has chosen this，that，and the other，and placed them together to compose something new．But it is impossible to say“this is comic”，or“that is tragic”，nor are we certain，since short stories，we have been taught，should be brief and conclusive，whether this，which is vague and inconclusive，should be called a short story at all．

The most elementary remarks upon modern English fiction can hardly avoid some mention of the Russian influence，and if the Russians are mentioned one runs the risk of feeling that to write of any fiction save theirs is waste of time．If we want understanding of the soul and heart where else shall we find it of comparable profundity？If we are sick of our own materialism the least considerable of their novelists has by right of birth a natural reverence for the human spirit．“Learn to make yourself akin to people .... But let this sympathy be not with the mind — for it is easy with the mind — but with the heart，with love towards them．”In every great Russian writer we seem to discern the features of a saint，if sympathy for the sufferings of others，love towards them，endeavour to reach some goal worthy of the most exacting demands of the spirit constitute saintliness．It is the saint in them which confounds us with a feeling of our own irreligious triviality，and turns so many of our famous novels to tinsel and trickery．The conclusions of the Russian mind，thus comprehensive and compassionate，are inevitably，perhaps，of the utmost sadness．More accurately indeed we might speak of the inconclusiveness of the Russian mind．It is the sense that there is no answer，that if honestly examined life presents question after question which must be left to sound on and on after the story is over in hopeless interrogation that fills us with a deep，and finally it may be with a resentful，despair．They are right perhaps；unquestionably they see further than we do and without our gross impediments of vision．But perhaps we see something that escapes them，or why should this voice of protest mix itself with our gloom？The voice of protest is the voice of another and an ancient civilisation which seems to have bred in us the instinct to enjoy and fight rather than to suffer and understand．English fiction from Sterne to Meredith bears witness to our natural delight in humour and comedy，in the beauty of earth，in the activities of the intellect，and in the splendour of the body．But any deductions that we may draw from the comparison of two fictions so immeasurably far apart are futile save indeed as they flood us with a view of the infinite possibilities of the art and remind us that there is no limit to the horizon，and that nothing — no “method”，no experiment，even of the wildest — is forbidden，but only falsity and pretence．“The proper stuff of fiction” does not exist；everything is the proper stuff of fiction，every feeling，every thought；every quality of brain and spirit is drawn upon；no perception comes amiss．And if we can imagine the art of fiction come alive and standing in our midst，she would undoubtedly bid us break her and bully her，as well as honour and love her，for so her youth is renewed and her sovereignty assured．





The Patron and the Crocus


Young men and women beginning to write are generally given the plausible but utterly impracticable advice to write what they have to write as shortly as possible，as clearly as possible，and without other thought in their minds except to say exactly what is in them．Nobody ever adds on these occasions the one thing needful：“And be sure you choose your patron wisely”，though that is the gist of the whole matter．For a book is always written for somebody to read，and，since the patron is not merely the paymaster，but also in a very subtle and insidious way the instigator and inspirer of what is written，it is of the utmost importance that he should be a desirable man．

But who，then，is the desirable man — the patron who will cajole the best out of the writer's brain and bring to birth the most varied and vigorous progeny of which he is capable？Different ages have answered the question differently．The Elizabethans，to speak roughly，chose the aristocracy to write for and the playhouse public．The eighteenth-century patron was a combination of coffee-house wit and Grub Street bookseller．In the nineteenth century the great writers wrote for the half-crown magazines and the leisured classes．And looking back and applauding the splendid results of these different alliances，it all seems enviably simple，and plain as a pikestaff compared with our own predicament — for whom should we write？For the present supply of patrons is of unexampled and bewildering variety．There is the daily Press，the weekly Press，the monthly Press；the English public and the American public；the best-seller public and the worst-seller public；the high-brow public and the red-blood public；all now organised self-conscious entities capable through their various mouthpieces of making their needs known and their approval or displeasure felt．Thus the writer who has been moved by the sight of the first crocus in Kensington Gardens has，before he sets pen to paper，to choose from a crowd of competitors the particular patron who suits him best．It is futile to say，“Dismiss them all；think only of your crocus”，because writing is a method of communication；and the crocus is an imperfect crocus until it has been shared．The first man or the last may write for himself alone，but he is an exception and an unenviable one at that，and the gulls are welcome to his works if the gulls can read them．

Granted，then，that every writer has some public or other at the end of his pen，the high-minded will say that it should be a submissive public，accepting obediently whatever he likes to give it．Plausible as the theory sounds，great risks are attached to it．For in that case the writer remains conscious of his public，yet is superior to it — an uncomfortable and unfortunate combination，as the works of Samuel Butler，George Meredith，and Henry James may be taken to prove．Each despised the public；each desired a public；each failed to attain a public；and each wreaked his failure upon the public by a succession，gradually increasing in intensity，of angularities，obscurities，and affectations which no writer whose patron was his equal and friend would have thought it necessary to inflict．Their crocuses，in consequence，are tortured plants，beautiful and bright，but with something wry-necked about them，malformed，shrivelled on the one side，overblown on the other．A touch of the sun would have done them a world of good．Shall we then rush to the opposite extreme and accept（if in fancy alone）the flattering proposals which the editors of the Times and the Daily News may be supposed to make us — “Twenty pounds down for your crocus in precisely fifteen hundred words，which shall blossom upon every breakfast table from John o' Groats to the Land's End before nine o'clock tomorrow morning with the writer's name attached”？

But will one crocus be enough，and must it not be a very brilliant yellow to shine so far，to cost so much，and to have one's name attached to it？The Press is undoubtedly a great multiplier of crocuses．But if we look at some of these plants，we shall find that they are only very distantly related to the original little yellow or purple flower which pokes up through the grass in Kensington Gardens early in March every year．The newspaper crocus is an amazing but still a very different plant．It fills precisely the space allotted to it．It radiates a golden glow．It is genial，affable，warm-hearted．It is beautifully finished，too，for let nobody think that the art of “our dramatic critic” of the Times or of Mr．Lynd of the Daily News is an easy one．It is no despicable feat to start a million brains running at nine o'clock in the morning，to give two million eyes something bright and brisk and amusing to look at．But the night comes and these flowers fade．so little bits of glass lose their lustre if you take them out of the sea；great prima donnas howl like hyenas if you shut them up in telephone boxes；and the most brilliant of articles when removed from its element is dust and sand and the husks of straw．Journalism embalmed in a book is unreadable．

The patron we want，then，is one who will help us to preserve our flowers from decay．But as his qualities change from age to age，and it needs considerable integrity and conviction not to be dazzled by the pretensions or bamboozled by the persuasions of the competing crowd，this business of patron-finding is one of the tests and trials of authorship．To know whom to write for is to know how to write．some of the modern patron's qualities are，however，fairly plain．The writer will require at this moment，it is obvious，a patron with the book-reading habit rather than the play-going habit．Nowadays，too，he must be instructed in the literature of other times and races．But there are other qualities which our special weaknesses and tendencies demand in him．There is the question of indecency，for instance，which plagues us and puzzles us much more than it did the Elizabethans．The twentieth-century patron must be immune from shock．He must distinguish infallibly between the little clod of manure which sticks to the crocus of necessity，and that which is plastered to it out of bravado．He must be a judge，too，of those social influences which inevitably play so large a part in modern literature，and able to say which matures and fortifies，which inhibits and makes sterile．Further，there is emotion for him to pronounce on，and in no department can he do more useful work than in bracing a writer against sentimentality on the one hand and a craven fear of expressing his feeling on the other．It is worse，he will say，and perhaps more common，to be afraid of feeling than to feel too much．He will add，perhaps，something about language，and point out how many words Shakespeare used and how much grammar Shakespeare violated，while we，though we keep our fingers so demurely to the black notes on the piano，have not appreciably improved upon Antony and Cleopatra．And if you can forget your sex altogether，he will say，so much the better；a writer has none．But all this is by the way — elementary and disputable．The patron's prime quality is something different，only to be expressed perhaps by the use of that convenient word which cloaks so much — atmosphere．It is necessary that the patron should shed and envelop the crocus in an atmosphere which makes it appear a plant of the very highest importance，so that to misrepresent it is the one outrage not to be forgiven this side of the grave．He must make us feel that a single crocus，if it be a real crocus，is enough for him；that he does not want to be lectured，elevated，instructed，or improved；that he is sorry that he bullied Carlyle into vociferation，Tennyson into idyllics，and Ruskin into insanity；that he is now ready to efface himself or assert himself as his writers require；that he is bound to them by a more than maternal tie；that they are twins indeed，one dying if the other dies，one flourishing if the other flourishes；that the fate of literature depends upon their happy alliance — all of which proves，as we began by saying，that the choice of a patron is of the highest importance．But how to choose rightly？How to write well？Those are the questions．





The Modern Essay


As Mr．Rhys truly says，it is unnecessary to go profoundly into the history and origin of the essay — whether it derives from socrates or Siranney the Persian — since，like all living things，its present is more important than its past．Moreover，the family is widely spread；and while some of its representatives have risen in the world and wear their coronets with the best，others pick up a precarious living in the gutter near Fleet Street．The form，too，admits variety．The essay can be short or long，serious or trifling，about God and Spinoza，or about turtles and Cheapside．But as we turn over the pages of these five little volumes，containing essays written between 1870 and 1920，certain principles appear to control the chaos，and we detect in the short period under review something like the progress of history．

Of all forms of literature，however，the essay is the one which least calls for the use of long words．The principle which controls it is simply that it should give pleasure；the desire which impels us when we take it from the shelf is simply to receive pleasure．Everything in an essay must be subdued to that end．It should lay us under a spell with its first word，and we should only wake，refreshed，with its last．In the interval we may pass through the most various experiences of amusement，surprise，interest，indignation；we may soar to the heights of fantasy with Lamb or plunge to the depths of wisdom with Bacon，but we must never be roused．The essay must lap us about and draw its curtain across the world．

So great a feat is seldom accomplished，though the fault may well be as much on the reader's side as on the writer's．Habit and lethargy have dulled his palate．A novel has a story，a poem rhyme；but what art can the essayist use in these short lengths of prose to sting us wide awake and fix us in a trance which is not sleep but rather an intensification of life — a basking，with every faculty alert，in the sun of pleasure？He must know — that is the first essential — how to write．His learning may be as profound as Mark Pattison's，but in an essay it must be so fused by the magic of writing that not a fact juts out，not a dogma tears the surface of the texture．Macaulay in one way，Froude in another，did this superbly over and over again．They have blown more knowledge into us in the course of one essay than the innumerable chapters of a hundred text-books．But when Mark Pattison has to tell us，in the space of thirty-five little pages，about Montaigne，we feel that he had not previously assimilated M．Grün．M．Grün was a gentleman who once wrote a bad book．M．Grün and his book should have been embalmed for our perpetual delight in amber．But the process is fatiguing；it requires more time and perhaps more temper than Pattison had at his command．He served M．Grün up raw，and he remains a crude berry among the cooked meats，upon which our teeth must grate for ever．something of the sort applies to Matthew Arnold and a certain translator of Spinoza．Literal truth-telling and finding fault with a culprit for his good are out of place in an essay，where everything should be for our good and rather for eternity than for the March number of the Fortnightly Review．But if the voice of the scold should never be heard in this narrow plot，there is another voice which is as a plague of locusts — the voice of a man stumbling drowsily among loose words，clutching aimlessly at vague ideas，the voice，for example，of Mr．Hutton in the following passage：

Add to this that his married life was very brief，only seven years and a half，being unexpectedly cut short，and that his passionate reverence for his wife's memory and genius — in his own words，“a religion” — was one which，as he must have been perfectly sensible，he could not make to appear otherwise than extravagant，not to say an hallucination，in the eyes of the rest of mankind，and yet that he was possessed by an irresistible yearning to attempt to embody it in all the tender and enthusiastic hyperbole of which it is so pathetic to find a man who gained his fame by his “dry-light” a master，and it is impossible not to feel that the human incidents in Mr．Mill's career are very sad．

A book could take that blow，but it sinks an essay．A biography in two volumes is indeed the proper depository；for there，where the licence is so much wider，and hints and glimpses of outside things make part of the feast（we refer to the old type of Victorian volume），these yawns and stretches hardly matter，and have indeed some positive value of their own．But that value，which is contributed by the reader，perhaps illicitly，in his desire to get as much into the book from all possible sources as he can，must be ruled out here．

There is no room for the impurities of literature in an essay．somehow or other，by dint of labour or bounty of nature，or both combined，the essay must be pure — pure like water or pure like wine，but pure from dullness，deadness，and deposits of extraneous matter．Of all writers in the first volume，Walter Pater best achieves this arduous task，because before setting out to write his essay（“Notes on Leonardo da Vinci”）he has somehow contrived to get his material fused．He is a learned man，but it is not knowledge of Leonardo that remains with us，but a vision，such as we get in a good novel where everything contributes to bring the writer's conception as a whole before us．Only here，in the essay，where the bounds are so strict and facts have to be used in their nakedness，the true writer like Walter Pater makes these limitations yield their own quality．Truth will give it authority；from its narrow limits he will get shape and intensity；and then there is no more fitting place for some of those ornaments which the old writers loved and we，by calling them ornaments，presumably despise．Nowadays nobody would have the courage to embark on the once famous description of Leonardo's lady who has

learned the secrets of the grave；and has been a diver in deep seas and keeps their fallen day about her；and trafficked for strange webs with Eastern merchants；and，as Leda，was the mother of Helen of Troy，and，as Saint Anne，the mother of Mary ...

The passage is too thumb-marked to slip naturally into the context．But when we come unexpectedly upon “the smiling of women and the motion of great waters”，or upon “full of the refinement of the dead，in sad，earth-coloured raiment，set with pale stones”，we suddenly remember that we have ears and we have eyes，and that the English language fills a long array of stout volumes with innumerable words，many of which are of more than one syllable．The only living Englishman who ever looks into these volumes is，of course，a gentleman of Polish extraction．But doubtless our abstention saves us much gush，much rhetoric，much high-stepping and cloud-prancing，and for the sake of the prevailing sobriety and hard-headedness we should be willing to barter the splendour of Sir Thomas Browne and the vigour of Swift．

Yet，if the essay admits more properly than biography or fiction of sudden boldness and metaphor，and can be polished till every atom of its surface shines，there are dangers in that too．We are soon in sight of ornament．soon the current，which is the life-blood of literature，runs slow；and instead of sparkling and flashing or moving with a quieter impulse which has a deeper excitement，words coagulate together in frozen sprays which，like the grapes on a Christmas-tree，glitter for a single night，but are dusty and garish the day after．The temptation to decorate is great where the theme may be of the slightest．What is there to interest another in the fact that one has enjoyed a walking tour，or has amused oneself by rambling down Cheapside and looking at the turtles in Mr．Sweeting's shop window？Stevenson and Samuel Butler chose very different methods of exciting our interest in these domestic themes．Stevenson，of course，trimmed and polished and set out his matter in the traditional eighteenth-century form．It is admirably done，but we cannot help feeling anxious，as the essay proceeds，lest the material may give out under the craftsman's fingers．The ingot is so small，the manipulation so incessant．And perhaps that is why the peroration —

To sit still and contemplate — to remember the faces of women without desire，to be pleased by the great deeds of men without envy，to be everything and everywhere in sympathy and yet content to remain where and what you are —

has the sort of insubstantiality which suggests that by the time he got to the end he had left himself nothing solid to work with．Butler adopted the very opposite method．Think your own thoughts，he seems to say，and speak them as plainly as you can．These turtles in the shop window which appear to leak out of their shells through heads and feet suggest a fatal faithfulness to a fixed idea．And so，striding unconcernedly from one idea to the next，we traverse a large stretch of ground；observe that a wound in the solicitor is a very serious thing；that Mary Queen of Scots wears surgical boots and is subject to fits near the Horse Shoe in Tottenham Court Road；take it for granted that no one really cares about Æschylus；and so，with many amusing anecdotes and some profound reflections，reach the peroration，which is that，as he had been told not to see more in Cheapside than he could get into twelve pages of the Universal Review，he had better stop．And yet obviously Butler is at least as careful of our pleasure as Stevenson；and to write like oneself and call it not writing is a much harder exercise in style than to write like Addison and call it writing well．

But，however much they differ individually，the Victorian essayists yet had something in common．They wrote at greater length than is now usual，and they wrote for a public which had not only time to sit down to its magazine seriously，but a high，if peculiarly Victorian，standard of culture by which to judge it．It was worth while to speak out upon serious matters in an essay；and there was nothing absurd in writing as well as one possibly could when，in a month or two，the same public which had welcomed the essay in a magazine would carefully read it once more in a book．But a change came from a small audience of cultivated people to a larger audience of people who were not quite so cultivated．The change was not altogether for the worse．In volume iii．we find Mr．Birrell and Mr．Beerbohm．It might even be said that there was a reversion to the classic type，and that the essay by losing its size and something of its sonority was approaching more nearly the essay of Addison and Lamb．At any rate，there is a great gulf between Mr．Birrell on Carlyle and the essay which one may suppose that Carlyle would have written upon Mr．Birrell．There is little similarity between A Cloud of Pinafores，by Max Beerbohm，and A Cynic's Apology，by Leslie Stephen．But the essay is alive；there is no reason to despair．As the conditions change so the essayist，most sensitive of all plants to public opinion，adapts himself，and if he is good makes the best of the change，and if he is bad the worst．Mr．Birrell is certainly good；and so we find that，though he has dropped a considerable amount of weight，his attack is much more direct and his movement more supple．But what did Mr．Beerbohm give to the essay and what did he take from it？That is a much more complicated question，for here we have an essayist who has concentrated on the work and is without doubt the prince of his profession．

What Mr．Beerbohm gave was，of course，himself．This presence，which has haunted the essay fitfully from the time of Montaigne，had been in exile since the death of Charles Lamb．Matthew Arnold was never to his readers Matt，nor Walter Pater affectionately abbreviated in a thousand homes to Wat．They gave us much，but that they did not give．Thus，some time in the nineties，it must have surprised readers accustomed to exhortation，information，and denunciation to find themselves familiarly addressed by a voice which seemed to belong to a man no larger than themselves．He was affected by private joys and sorrows，and had no gospel to preach and no learning to impart．He was himself，simply and directly，and himself he has remained．Once again we have an essayist capable of using the essayist's most proper but most dangerous and delicate tool．He has brought personality into literature，not unconsciously and impurely，but so consciously and purely that we do not know whether there is any relation between Max the essayist and Mr．Beerbohm the man．We only know that the spirit of personality permeates every word that he writes．The triumph is the triumph of style．For it is only by knowing how to write that you can make use in literature of your self；that self which，while it is essential to literature，is also its most dangerous antagonist．Never to be yourself and yet always — that is the problem．some of the essayists in Mr．Rhys' collection，to be frank，have not altogether succeeded in solving it．We are nauseated by the sight of trivial personalities decomposing in the eternity of print．As talk，no doubt，it was charming，and certainly the writer is a good fellow to meet over a bottle of beer．But literature is stern；it is no use being charming，virtuous，or even learned and brilliant into the bargain，unless，she seems to reiterate，you fulfil her first condition — to know how to write．

This art is possessed to perfection by Mr．Beerbohm．But he has not searched the dictionary for polysyllables．He has not moulded firm periods or seduced our ears with intricate cadences and strange melodies．some of his companions — Henley and Stevenson，for example — are momentarily more impressive．But A Cloud of Pinafores has in it that indescribable inequality，stir，and final expressiveness which belong to life and to life alone．You have not finished with it because you have read it，any more than friendship is ended because it is time to part．Life wells up and alters and adds．Even things in a bookcase change if they are alive；we find ourselves wanting to meet them again；we find them altered．so we look back upon essay after essay by Mr．Beerbohm，knowing that，come September or May，we shall sit down with them and talk．Yet it is true that the essayist is the most sensitive of all writers to public opinion．The drawing-room is the place where a great deal of reading is done nowadays，and the essays of Mr．Beerbohm lie，with an exquisite appreciation of all that the position exacts，upon the drawing-room table．There is no gin about；no strong tobacco；no puns，drunkenness，or insanity．Ladies and gentlemen talk together，and some things，of course，are not said．

But if it would be foolish to attempt to confine Mr．Beerbohm to one room，it would be still more foolish，unhappily，to make him，the artist，the man who gives us only his best，the representative of our age．There are no essays by Mr．Beerbohm in the fourth or fifth volumes of the present collection．His age seems already a little distant，and the drawing-room table，as it recedes，begins to look rather like an altar where，once upon a time，people deposited offerings — fruit from their own orchards，gifts carved with their own hands．Now once more the conditions have changed．The public needs essays as much as ever，and perhaps even more．The demand for the light middle not exceeding fifteen hundred words，or in special cases seventeen hundred and fifty，much exceeds the supply．Where Lamb wrote one essay and Max perhaps writes two，Mr．Belloc at a rough computation produces three hundred and sixty-five．They are very short，it is true．Yet with what dexterity the practised essayist will utilise his space — beginning as close to the top of the sheet as possible，judging precisely how far to go，when to turn，and how，without sacrificing a hair's-breadth of paper，to wheel about and alight accurately upon the last word his editor allows！As a feat of skill it is well worth watching．But the personality upon which Mr．Belloc，like Mr．Beerbohm，depends suffers in the process．It comes to us not with the natural richness of the speaking voice，but strained and thin and full of mannerisms and affectations，like the voice of a man shouting through a megaphone to a crowd on a windy day．“Little friends，my readers”，he says in the essay called “An Unknown Country”，and he goes on to tell us how —

There was a shepherd the other day at Findon Fair who had come from the east by Lewes with sheep，and who had in his eyes that reminiscence of horizons which makes the eyes of shepherds and of mountaineers different from the eyes of other men .... I went with him to hear what he had to say，for shepherds talk quite differently from other men．

Happily this shepherd had little to say，even under the stimulus of the inevitable mug of beer，about the Unknown Country，for the only remark that he did make proves him either a minor poet，unfit for the care of sheep，or Mr．Belloc himself masquerading with a fountain pen．That is the penalty which the habitual essayist must now be prepared to face．He must masquerade．He cannot afford the time either to be himself or to be other people．He must skim the surface of thought and dilute the strength of personality．He must give us a worn weekly halfpenny instead of a solid sovereign once a year．

But it is not Mr．Belloc only who has suffered from the prevailing conditions．The essays which bring the collection to the year 1920 may not be the best of their authors' work，but，if we except writers like Mr．Conrad and Mr．Hudson，who have strayed into essay writing accidentally，and concentrate upon those who write essays habitually，we shall find them a good deal affected by the change in their circumstances．To write weekly，to write daily，to write shortly，to write for busy people catching trains in the morning or for tired people coming home in the evening，is a heart-breaking task for men who know good writing from bad．They do it，but instinctively draw out of harm's way anything precious that might be damaged by contact with the public，or anything sharp that might irritate its skin．And so，if one reads Mr．Lucas，Mr．Lynd，or Mr．Squire in the bulk，one feels that a common greyness silvers everything．They are as far removed from the extravagant beauty of Walter Pater as they are from the intemperate candour of Leslie Stephen．Beauty and courage are dangerous spirits to bottle in a column and a half；and thought，like a brown paper parcel in a waistcoat pocket，has a way of spoiling the symmetry of an article．It is a kind，tired，apathetic world for which they write，and the marvel is that they never cease to attempt，at least，to write well．

But there is no need to pity Mr．Clutton Brock for this change in the essayist's conditions．He has clearly made the best of his circumstances and not the worst．One hesitates even to say that he has had to make any conscious effort in the matter，so naturally has he effected the transition from the private essayist to the public，from the drawing-room to the Albert Hall．Paradoxically enough，the shrinkage in size has brought about a corresponding expansion of individuality．We have no longer the “I” of Max and of Lamb，but the “we” of public bodies and other sublime personages．It is “we” who go to hear the Magic Flute；“we” who ought to profit by it；“we”，in some mysterious way，who，in our corporate capacity，once upon a time actually wrote it．For music and literature and art must submit to the same generalisation or they will not carry to the farthest recesses of the Albert Hall．That the voice of Mr．Clutton Brock，so sincere and so disinterested，carries such a distance and reaches so many without pandering to the weakness of the mass or its passions must be a matter of legitimate satisfaction to us all．But while “we” are gratified，“I”，that unruly partner in the human fellowship，is reduced to despair．“I” must always think things for himself，and feel things for himself．To share them in a diluted form with the majority of well-educated and well-intentioned men and women is for him sheer agony；and while the rest of us listen intently and profit profoundly，“I” slips off to the woods and the fields and rejoices in a single blade of grass or a solitary potato．

In the fifth volume of modern essays，it seems，we have got some way from pleasure and the art of writing．But in justice to the essayists of 1920 we must be sure that we are not praising the famous because they have been praised already and the dead because we shall never meet them wearing spats in Piccadilly．We must know what we mean when we say that they can write and give us pleasure．We must compare them；we must bring out the quality．We must point to this and say it is good because it is exact，truthful，and imaginative：

Nay，retire men cannot when they would；neither will they，when it were Reason；but are impatient of Privateness，even in age and sickness，which require the shadow：like old Townsmen：that will still be sitting at their street door，though therby they offer Age to Scorn ...

and to this，and say it is bad because it is loose，plausible，and commonplace：

With courteous and precise cynicism on his lips，he thought of quiet virginal chambers，of waters singing under the moon，of terraces where taintless music sobbed into the open night，of pure maternal mistresses with protecting arms and vigilant eyes，of fields slumbering in the sunlight，of leagues of ocean heaving under warm tremulous heavens，of hot ports，gorgeous and perfumed ...

It goes on，but already we are bemused with sound and neither feel nor hear．The comparison makes us suspect that the art of writing has for backbone some fierce attachment to an idea．It is on the back of an idea，something believed in with conviction or seen with precision and thus compelling words to its shape，that the diverse company which includes Lamb and Bacon，and Mr．Beerbohm and Hudson，and Vernon Lee and Mr．Conrad，and Leslie Stephen and Butler and Walter Pater reaches the farther shore．Very various talents have helped or hindered the passage of the idea into words．some scrape through painfully；others fly with every wind favouring．But Mr．Belloc and Mr．Lucas and Mr．Squire are not fiercely attached to anything in itself．They share the contemporary dilemma — that lack of an obstinate conviction which lifts ephemeral sounds through the misty sphere of anybody's language to the land where there is a perpetual marriage，a perpetual union．Vague as all definitions are，a good essay must have this permanent quality about it；it must draw its curtain round us，but it must be a curtain that shuts us in，not out．





Dr．Burney's Evening Party


I


The party was given either in 1777 or in 1778；on which day or month of the year is not known，but the night was cold．Fanny Burney，from whom we get much of our information，was accordingly either twenty-five or twenty-six，as we choose．But in order to enjoy the party to the full it is necessary to go back some years and to scrape acquaintance with the guests．

Fanny，from the earliest days，had always been fond of writing．There was a cabin at the end of her stepmother's garden at King's Lynn，where she used to sit and write of an afternoon till the oaths of the seamen sailing up and down the river drove her in．But it was only in the afternoon and in remote places that her half-suppressed，uneasy passion for writing had its way．Writing was held to be slightly ridiculous in a girl；rather unseemly in a woman．Besides，one never knew，if a girl kept a diary，whether she might not say something indiscreet — so Miss Dolly Young warned her；and Miss Dolly Young，though exceedingly plain，was esteemed a woman of the highest character in King's Lynn．Fanny's stepmother also disapproved of writing．Yet so keen was the joy — “I cannot express the pleasure I have in writing down my thoughts at the very moment，and my opinion of people when I first see them” — that scribble she must．Loose sheets of paper fell from her pocket and were picked up and read by her father to her agony and shame；once she was forced to make a bonfire of all her papers in the back garden．At last some kind of compromise seems to have been arrived at．The morning was sacred to serious tasks like sewing；it was only in the afternoon that she allowed herself to scribble — Letters，diaries，stories，verses in the look-out place which overhung the river，till the oaths of the sailors drove her in．

There was something strange in that，perhaps，for the eighteenth century was the age of oaths．Fanny's early diary is larded with them．“God help me”，“Split me”，“Stap my vitals”，together with damneds and devilishes，dropped daily and hourly from the lips of her adored father and her venerated Daddy Crisp．Perhaps Fanny's attitude to language was altogether a little abnormal．She was immensely susceptible to the power of words，but not nervously or acutely as Jane Austen was．She adored fluency and the sound of language pouring warmly and copiously over the printed page．Directly she read Rasselas，enlarged and swollen sentences formed on the tip of her childish pen in the manner of Dr．Johnson．Quite early in life she would go out of her way to avoid the plain name of Tomkins．Thus，whatever she heard from her cabin at the end of the garden was sure to affect her more than most girls，and it is also clear that while her ears were sensitive to sound，her soul was sensitive to meaning．There was something a little prudish in her nature．Just as she avoided the name of Tomkins，so she avoided the roughnesses，the asperities，the plainnesses of daily life．The chief fault that mars the extreme vivacity and vividness of the early diary is that the profusion of words tends to soften the edges of the sentences，and the sweetness of the sentiment to smooth out the outlines of the thought．Thus，when she heard the sailors swearing，though Maria Allen，her half-sister，would，one believes，have liked to stay and toss a kiss over the water — her future history allows us to take the liberty of thinking so — Fanny went indoors．

Fanny went indoors，but not to solitary meditation．The house，whether it was in Lynn or in London — and by far the greater part of the year was spent in Poland Street — hummed with activity．There was the sound of the harpsichord；the sound of singing；there was the sound — for such concentration seems to pervade a whole house with its murmur — of Dr．Burney writing furiously，surrounded by notebooks，in his study；and there were great bursts of chatter and laughter when，returning from their various occupations，the Burney children met together．Nobody enjoyed family life more than Fanny did．For there her shyness only served to fasten the nickname of Old Lady upon her；there she had a familiar audience for her humour；there she need not bother about her clothes；there — perhaps the fact that their mother had died when they were all young was partly the cause of it — was that intimacy which expresses itself in jokes and legends and a private language（“The wig is wet”，they would say，winking at each other）；there were endless confabulations，and confidences between sisters and brothers and brothers and sisters．Nor could there be any doubt that the Burneys — Susan and James and Charles and Fanny and Hetty and Charlotte — were a gifted race．Charles was a scholar；James was a humorist；Fanny was a writer；Susan was musical — each had some special gift or characteristic to add to the common stock．And besides their natural gifts they were happy in the fact that their father was a very popular man；a man，too，so admirably situated by his talents，which were social，and his birth，which was gentle，that they could mix without difficulty either with lords or with bookbinders，and had，in fact，as free a run of life as could be wished．

As for Dr．Burney himself，there are some points about which，at this distance of time，one may feel dubious．It is difficult to be sure what，had one met him now，one would have felt for him．One thing is certain — one would have met him everywhere．Hostesses would be competing to catch him．Notes would wait for him．Telephone bells would interrupt him．For he was the most sought-after，the most occupied of men．He was always dashing in and dashing out．sometimes he dined off a box of sandwiches in his carriage．sometimes he went out at seven in the morning，and was not back from his round of music lessons till eleven at night．The “habitual softness of his manners”，his great social charm，endeared him to everybody．His haphazard untidy ways — everything，notes，money，manuscripts，was tossed into a drawer，and he was robbed of all his savings once，but his friends were delighted to make it up for him；his odd adventures — did he not fall asleep after a bad crossing at Dover，and so return to France and so have to cross the Channel again？— gave him a claim upon people's kindness and sympathy．It is，perhaps，his diffuseness that makes him a trifle nebulous．He seems to be for ever writing and then rewriting，and requiring his daughters to write for him，endless books and articles，while over him，unchecked，unfiled，unread perhaps，pour down notes，Letters，invitations to dinner which he cannot destroy and means some day to annotate and collect，until he seems to melt away at last in a cloud of words．When he died at the age of eighty-eight，there was nothing to be done by the most devoted of daughters but to burn the whole accumulation entire．Even Fanny's love of language was suffocated．But if we fumble a little as to our feeling for Dr．Burney，Fanny certainly did not．She adored her father．She never minded how many times she had to lay aside her own writing in order to copy out his．And he returned her affection．Though his ambition for her success at Court was foolish，perhaps，and almost cost her her life，she had only to cry when a distasteful suitor was pressed on her，“Oh，Sir，I wish for nothing！Only let me live with you！” for the emotional doctor to reply，“My Life！Thou shall live with me for ever if thou wilt．Thou canst not think I meant to get rid of thee？” And not only were his eyes full of tears，but，what was more remarkable，he never mentioned Mr．Barlow again．Indeed，the Burneys were a happy family；a mixed composite，oddly assorted family；for there were the Aliens，too，and little half-brothers and half-sisters were being born and growing up．

So time passed，and the passage of the years made it impossible for the family to continue in Poland Street any longer．First they moved to Queen Square，and then，in 1774，to the house where Newton had lived，in St．Martin's Street，Leicester Fields；where his Observatory still stood，and his room with the painted panels was still to be seen．Here in a mean street，but in the centre of the town，the Burneys set up their establishment．Here Fanny went on scribbling，stealing to the Observatory as she had stolen to the cabin at Lynn，for she exclaimed，“I cannot any longer resist what I find to be irresistible，the pleasure of popping down my thoughts from time to time upon paper”．Here came so many famous people either to be closeted with the doctor，or，like Garrick，to sit with him while his fine head of natural hair was brushed，or to join the lively family dinner，or，more formally，to gather together in a musical party，where all the Burney children played and their father “dashed away” on the harpsichord，and perhaps some foreign musician of distinction performed a solo — so many people came for one reason or another to the house in St．Martin's Street that it is only the eccentrics，the grotesques，that catch the eye．One remembers，for instance，the Ajujari，the astonishing soprano，because she had been “mauled as an infant by a pig，in consequence of which she is reported to have a silver side”．One remembers Bruce，the traveller，because he had a most extraordinary complaint．When he attempted to speak，his whole stomach suddenly seemed to heave like an organ bellows．He did not wish to make any secret about it，but spoke of it as having originated in Abyssinia．However，one evening，when he appeared rather agitated，it lasted much longer than usual，and was so violent that it alarmed the company．

One seems to remember，for she paints herself while she paints the others，Fanny herself slipping eagerly and lightly in and out of all this company，with her rather prominent gnat-like eyes，and her shy，awkward manners．But the gnat-like eyes，the awkward manners，concealed the quickest observation，the most retentive memory．As soon as the company had gone，she stole to the Observatory and wrote down every word，every scene，in Letters twelve pages long，for her beloved Daddy Crisp at Chessington．That old hermit — he had retired to a house in a field in dudgeon with society — though professing to be better pleased with a bottle of wine in his cellar and a horse in his stable，and a game of backgammon at night，than with all the fine company in the world，was always agog for news．He scolded his Fannikin if she did not tell him all about her fine goings-on．And he scolded her again if she did not write at full tilt exactly as the words came into her head．

Mr．Crisp wanted to know in particular “about Mr．Greville and his notions”．For，indeed，Mr．Greville was a perpetual source of curiosity．It is a thousand pities that time with her poppy dust has covered Mr．Greville so that only his most prominent features，his birth，his person，and his nose emerge．Fulke Greville was the descendant — he must，one fancies，have emphasised the fact from the way in which it is repeated — of the friend of Sir Philip Sidney．A coronet，indeed，“hung almost suspended over his head”．In person he was tall and well proportioned．“His face，features，and complexion were striking for masculine beauty．” “His air and carriage were noble with conscious dignity”；his bearing was “lofty，yet graceful”．But all these gifts and qualities，to which one must add that he rode and fenced and danced and played tennis to admiration，were marred by prodigious faults．He was supercilious in the extreme；he was selfish；he was fickle．He was a man of violent temper．His introduction to Dr．Burney in the first place was due to his doubt whether a musician could be fit company for a gentleman．When he found that young Burney not only played the harpsichord to perfection，but curved his finger and rounded his hand as he played；that he answered plain “Yes，Sir，” or “No，Sir，” being more interested in the music than in his patron；that it was only indeed when Greville himself thrummed pertinaciously from memory that he could stand it no longer，and broke into vivacious conversation — it was only when he found that young Burney was both gifted and well bred that，being himself a very clever man，he no longer stood upon his dignity．Burney became his friend and his equal．Burney，indeed，almost became his victim．For if there was one thing that the descendant of the friend of Sir Philip Sidney detested it was what he called “fogrum”．By that expressive word he seems to have meant the middle-class virtues of discretion and respectability，as opposed to the aristocratic virtues of what he called “ton”．Life must be lived dashingly，daringly，with perpetual display，even if the display was extremely expensive，and，as seemed possible to those who trailed dismally round his grounds praising the improvements，as boring to the man who made it as to the unfortunate guests whose admiration he insisted upon extorting．But Greville could not endure fogrum in himself or in his friends．He threw the obscure young musician into the fast life of White's and Newmarket，and watched with amusement to see if he sank or swam．Burney，most adroit of men，swam as if born to the water，and the descendant of the friend of Sir Philip Sidney was pleased．From being his protégé？Burney became his confidant．Indeed，the splendid gentleman，for all his high carriage，was in need of one．For Greville，could one wipe away the poppy dust that covers him，was one of those tortured and unhappy souls who find themselves torn asunder by opposite desires．On the one hand he was consumed with the wish to be in the first flight of fashion and to do “the thing”，however costly or dreary “the thing” might be．On the other，he was secretly persuaded that “the proper bent of his mind and understanding was for metaphysics”．Burney，perhaps，was a link between the world of ton and the world of fogrum．He was a man of breeding who could dice and bet with the bloods；he was also a musician who could talk of intellectual things and ask clever people to his house．

Thus Greville treated the Burneys as his equals，and came to their house，though his visits were often interrupted by the violent quarrels which he managed to pick even with the amiable Dr．Burney himself．Indeed，as time went on there was nobody with whom Greville did not quarrel．He had lost heavily at the gambling-tables．His prestige in society was sunk．His habits were driving his family from him．Even his wife，by nature gentle and conciliatory，though excessive thinness made her seem fitted to sit for a portrait “of a penetrating，puissant and sarcastic fairy queen”，was wearied by his infidelities．Inspired by them she had suddenly produced that famous Ode to Indifference，“which had passed into every collection of fugitive pieces in the English language” and（it is Madam D'Arblay who speaks）“twined around her brow a garland of wide-spreading and unfading fragrance”．Her fame，it may be，was another thorn in her husband's side；for he，too，was an author．He himself had produced a volume of Maxims and Characters；and having “waited for fame with dignity rather than anxiety，because with expectation unclogged with doubt”，was beginning perhaps to become a little impatient when fame delayed．Meanwhile he was fond of the society of clever people，and it was largely at his desire that the famous party in St．Martin's Street met together that very cold night．





II


In those days，when London was so small，it was easier than now for people to stand on an eminence which they scarcely struggled to keep，but enjoyed by unanimous consent．Everybody knew and remembered when they saw her that Mrs．Greville had written an Ode to Indifference；everybody knew that Mr．Bruce had travelled in Abyssinia；so，too，everybody knew that there was a house at Streatham presided over by a lady called Mrs．Thrale．Without troubling to write an Ode，without hazarding her life among savages，without possessing either high rank or vast wealth，Mrs．Thrale was a celebrity．By the exercise of powers difficult to define — for to feel them one must have sat at table and noticed a thousand audacities and deftnesses and skilful combinations which die with the moment — Mrs．Thrale had the reputation of a great hostess．Her fame spread far beyond her house．People who had never seen her discussed her．People wanted to know what she was like；whether she was really so witty and so well read；whether it was a pose；whether she had a heart；whether she loved her husband the brewer，who seemed a dull dog；why she had married him；whether Dr．Johnson was in love with her — what，in short，was the truth of her story，the secret of her power．For power she had — that was indisputable．

Even then，perhaps，it would have been difficult to say in what it consisted．For she possessed the one quality which can never be named；she enjoyed the one gift which never ceases to excite discussion．somehow or other she was a personality．The young Burneys，for instance，had never seen Mrs．Thrale or been to Streatham，but the stir which she set going round her had reached them in St．Martin's Street．When their father came back from giving his first music lesson to Miss Thrale at Streatham they flocked about him to hear his account of her mother．Was she as brilliant as people made out？Was she kind？Was she cruel？Had he liked her？Dr．Burney was in high good temper — in itself a proof of his hostess's power — and he replied，not，we may be sure，as Fanny rendered it，that she was a “star of the first constellation of female wits：surpassing，rather than equalising the reputation which her extraordinary endowments，and the splendid fortune which made them conspicuous，had blazoned abroad” — that was written when Fanny's style was old and tarnished，and its leaves were fluttering and falling profusely to the ground；the doctor，we may suppose，answered briskly that he had enjoyed himself hugely；that the lady was a very clever lady；that she had interrupted the lesson all the time；that she had a very sharp tongue — there was no doubt of that；but he would go to the stake for it that she was a good-hearted woman at bottom．Then they must have pressed to know what she looked like．She looked younger than her age — which was about forty．She was rather plump，very small，fair with very blue eyes，and had a scar or cut on her lip．She painted her cheeks，which was unnecessary，because her complexion was rosy by nature．The whole impression she made was one of bustle and gaiety and good temper．She was，he said，a woman “full of sport”，whom nobody could have taken for a creature that the doctor could not bear，a learned lady．Less obviously，she was very observant，as her anecdotes were to prove；capable of passion，though that was not yet visible at Streatham；and，while curiously careless and good-tempered about her dues as a wit or a blue-stocking，had an amusing pride in being descended from a long line of Welsh gentry（whereas the Thrales were obscure），and drew satisfaction now and then from the reflection that in her veins ran the blood，as the College of Heralds acknowledged，of Adam of Salzburg．

Many women might have possessed these qualities without being remembered for them．Mrs．Thrale possessed besides one that has given her immortality：the power of being the friend of Dr．Johnson．Without that addition，her life might have fizzled and flamed to extinction，leaving nothing behind it．But the combination of Dr．Johnson and Mrs．Thrale created something as solid，as lasting，as remarkable in its way as a work of art．And this was an achievement that called for much rarer powers on the part of Mrs．Thrale than the qualities of a good hostess．When the Thrales first met Johnson he was in a state of profound gloom，crying out such lost and terrible words that Mr．Thrale put his hand before his mouth to silence him．Physically，too，he was afflicted with asthma and dropsy；his manners were rough；his habits were gross；his clothes were dirty；his wig was singed；his linen was soiled；and he was the rudest of men．Yet Mrs．Thrale carried this monster off with her to Brighton and then domesticated him in her house at Streatham，where he was given a room to himself，and where he spent habitually some days in the middle of every week．This might have been，it is true，but the enthusiasm of a curiosity hunter，ready to put up with a host of disagreeables for the sake of having at her house the original Dr．Johnson，whom anybody in England would gladly pay to see．But it is clear that her connoisseurship was of a finer type．She understood — her anecdotes prove it — that Dr．Johnson was somehow a rare，an important，an impressive human being whose friendship might be a burden but was certainly an honour．And it was not by any means so easy to know this then as it is now．What one knew then was that Dr．Johnson was coming to dinner．And when Dr．Johnson came to dinner one had to ask one's self who was coming too？For if it was a Cambridge man there might be an outburst．If it was a Whig there would certainly be a scene．If it was a Scotsman anything might happen．Such were his whims and prejudices．Next one would have to bethink one，what food had been ordered for dinner？For the food never went uncriticised；and even when one had provided him with young peas from the garden，one must not praise them．Were not the young peas charming，Mrs．Thrale asked once？and he turned upon her，after gobbling down masses of pork and veal pie with lumps of sugar in it，and snapped，“Perhaps they would be so — to a pig”．Then what would the talk be about — that was another cause for anxiety．If it got upon painting or music he was apt to dismiss it with scorn，for both arts were indifferent to him．Then if a traveller told a tale he was sure to pooh-pooh it，because he believed nothing that he had not seen himself．Then if anyone were to express sympathy in his presence it might well draw down upon one a rebuke for insincerity．

When，one day，I lamented the loss of a cousin killed in America：“Prithee，my dear，” said he，“have done with canting：how would the world be the worse for it，I may ask，if all your relations were at once spitted like larks，and roasted for Presto's supper？”

In short，the meal would be strewn with difficulties；the whole affair might run upon the rocks at any moment．

Had Mrs．Thrale been a shallow curiosity hunter she would have shown him for a season or so and then let him drop．But Mrs．Thrale realised even at the moment that one must submit to be snubbed and bullied and irritated and offended by Dr．Johnson because — well，what was the force that sent an impudent and arrogant young man like Boswell slinking back to his chair like a beaten boy when Johnson bade him？Why did she herself sit up till four in the morning pouring out tea for him？There was a force in him that awed even a competent woman of the world，that subdued even a thick-skinned，conceited boy．He had a right to scold Mrs．Thrale for inhumanity，when she knew that he spent only seventy pounds a year on himself and with the rest of his income supported a houseful of decrepit and ungrateful lodgers．If he gobbled at table and tore the peaches from the wall，he went back punctually to London to see that his wretched inmates had their three good meals over the week-end．Moreover，he was a warehouse of knowledge．If the dancing-master talked about dancing，Johnson could out-talk him．He could keep one amused by the hour with his tales of the underworld，of the topers and scallywags who haunted his lodgings and claimed his bounty．He said things casually that one never forgot．But what was perhaps more engaging than all this learning and virtue，was his love of pleasure，his detestation of the mere bookworm，his passion for life and society．And then，as a woman would，Mrs．Thrale loved him for his courage — that he had separated two fierce dogs that were tearing each other to pieces in Mr．Beauclerc's sitting-room；that he had thrown a man，chair and all，into the pit of a theatre；that，blind and twitching as he was，he rode to hounds on Brighthelmstone Downs，and followed the hunt as if he had been a gay dog instead of a huge and melancholy old man．Moreover，there was a natural affinity between them．She drew him out：she made him say what without her he would never have said；indeed，he had confessed to her some painful secret of his youth which she never revealed to anybody．Above all，they shared the same passion．Of talk they could neither of them ever have enough．

Thus Mrs．Thrale could always be counted on to produce Dr．Johnson；and it was，of course，Dr．Johnson whom Mr．Greville most particularly wished to meet．As it happened，Dr．Burney had renewed his acquaintance with Dr．Johnson after many years，when he went to Streatham to give his first music lesson，and Dr．Johnson had been there，“wearing his mildest aspect”．For he remembered Dr．Burney with kindness．He remembered a letter that Dr．Burney had written to him in praise of the dictionary；he remembered，too，that Dr．Burney having called upon him，years ago，and found him out，had dared to cut some bristles from the hearth broom to send to an admirer．When he met Dr．Burney again at Streatham，he had instantly taken a liking to him；soon he was brought by Mrs．Thrale to see Dr．Burney's books；it was quite easy，therefore，for Dr．Burney to arrange that on a certain night in the early spring of 1777 or 1778，Mr．Greville's great wish to meet Dr．Johnson and Mrs．Thrale should be gratified．A day was fixed and the engagement was made．

Whatever the day was it must have been marked in the host's calendar with a note of interrogation．Anything might happen．Any extreme of splendour or disaster might spring from the meeting of so many marked and distinguished characters．Dr．Johnson was formidable．Mr．Greville was domineering．Mrs．Greville was a celebrity in one way；Mrs．Thrale was a celebrity in another．Then it was an occasion．Everybody felt it to be so．Wits would be on the strain；expectation on tiptoe．Dr．Burney foresaw these difficulties and took steps to avert them，but there was，one vaguely feels，something a little obtuse about Dr．Burney．The eager，kind，busy man，with his head full of music and his desk stuffed with notes，lacked discrimination．The precise outline of people's characters was covered with a rambling pink haze．To his innocent mind music was the universal specific．Everybody must share his own enthusiasm for music．If there was going to be any difficulty，music could solve it．He therefore asked Signor Piozzi to be of the party．

The night arrived and the fire was lit．The chairs were placed and the company arrived．As Dr．Burney had foreseen，the awkwardness was great．Things indeed seemed to go wrong from the start．Dr．Johnson had come in his worsted wig，very clean and prepared evidently for enjoyment．But after one look at him，Mr．Greville seemed to decide that there was something formidable about the old man；it would be better not to compete；it would be better to play the fine gentleman，and leave it to literature to make the first advances．Murmuring，apparently，something about having the toothache，Mr．Greville “assumed his most supercilious air of distant superiority and planted himself，immovable as a noble statue，upon the hearth”．He said nothing．Then Mrs．Greville，though longing to distinguish herself，judged it proper for Dr．Johnson to begin，so that she said nothing．Mrs．Thrale，who might have been expected to break up the solemnity，felt，it seemed，that the party was not her party and，waiting for the principals to engage，resolved to say nothing either．Mrs．Crewe，the Grevilles' daughter，lovely and vivacious as she was，had come to be entertained and instructed and therefore very naturally she，too，said nothing．Nobody said anything．Complete silence reigned．Here was the very moment for which Dr．Burney in his wisdom had prepared．He nodded to Signor Piozzi；and Signor Piozzi stepped to the instrument and began to sing．Accompanying himself on the pianoforte，he sang an aria parlante．He sang beautifully，he sang his best．But far from breaking the awkwardness and loosing the tongues，the music increased the constraint．Nobody spoke．Everybody waited for Dr．Johnson to begin．There，indeed，they showed their fatal ignorance，for if there was one thing that Dr．Johnson never did，it was to begin．somebody had always to start a topic before he consented to pursue it or to demolish it．Now he waited in silence to be challenged．But he waited in vain．Nobody spoke．Nobody dared speak．The roulades of Signor Piozzi continued uninterrupted．As he saw his chance of a pleasant evening's talk drowned in the rattle of a piano，Dr．Johnson sank into silent abstraction and sat with his back to the piano gazing at the fire．The aria parlante continued uninterrupted．At last the strain became unendurable．At last Mrs．Thrale could stand it no longer．It was the attitude of Mr．Greville，apparently，that roused her resentment．There he stood on the hearth in front of the fire “staring around him at the whole company in curious silence sardonically”．What right had he，even if he were the descendant of the friend of Sir Philip Sidney，to despise the company and absorb the fire？Her own pride of ancestry suddenly asserted itself．Did not the blood of Adam of Salzburg run in her veins？Was it not as blue as that of the Grevilles and far more sparkling？Giving rein to the spirit of recklessness which sometimes bubbled in her，she rose，and stole on tiptoe to the pianoforte．Signor Piozzi was still singing and accompanying himself dramatically as he sang．She began a ludicrous mimicry of his gestures：she shrugged her shoulders，she cast up her eyes，she reclined her head on one side just as he did．At this singular display the company began to titter — indeed，it was a scene that was to be described “from coterie to coterie throughout London，with comments and sarcasms of endless variety”．People who saw Mrs．Thrale at her mockery that night never forgot that this was the beginning of that criminal affair，the first scene of that “most extraordinary drama” which lost Mrs．Thrale the respect of friends and children，which drove her in ignominy from England，and scarcely allowed her to show herself in London again — this was the beginning of her most reprehensible，her most unnatural passion for one who was not only a musician but a foreigner．But all this still lay on the laps of the gods．Nobody yet knew of what iniquity the vivacious lady was capable．She was still the respected wife of a wealthy brewer．Happily，Dr．Johnson was staring at the fire，and knew nothing of the scene at the piano．But Dr．Burney put a stop to the laughter instantly．He was shocked that a guest，even if a foreigner and a musician，should be ridiculed behind his back，and stealing to Mrs．Thrale he whispered kindly but with authority in her ear that if she had no taste for music herself she should consider the feelings of those who had．Mrs．Thrale took the rebuke with admirable sweetness，nodded her acquiescence and returned to her chair．But she had done her part．After that nothing more could be expected from her．Let them now do what they chose — she washed her hands of it，and seated herself “like a pretty little Miss”，as she said afterwards，to endure what yet remained to be endured “of one of the most humdrum evenings that she had ever passed”．

If no one had dared to tackle Dr．Johnson in the beginning，it was scarcely likely that they would dare now．He had apparently decided that the evening was a failure so far as talk was concerned．If he had not come dressed in his best clothes he might have had a book in his pocket which he could have pulled out and read．As it was，nothing but the resources of his own mind were left him；but these were huge；and these he explored as he sat with his back to the piano looking the very image of gravity，dignity，and composure．

At last the aria parlante came to an end．Signor Piozzi indeed，finding nobody to talk to，fell asleep in his solitude．Even Dr．Burney by this time must have been aware that music is not an infallible specific；but there was nothing for it now．Since people would not talk，the music must continue．He called upon his daughters to sing a duet．And then，when that was over，there was nothing for it but that they must sing another．Signor Piozzi still slept，or still feigned sleep．Dr．Johnson explored still further the magnificent resources of his own mind．Mr．Greville still stood superciliously upon the hearth-rug．And the night was cold．

But it was a grave mistake to suppose that because Dr．Johnson was apparently lost in thought，and certainly almost blind，he was not aware of anything，particularly of anything reprehensible，that was taking place in the room．His “starts of vision” were always astonishing and almost always painful．so it was on the present occasion．He suddenly woke up．He suddenly roused himself．He suddenly uttered the words for which the company had been waiting all the evening．

“If it were not for depriving the ladies of the fire”，he said，looking fixedly at Mr．Greville，“I should like to stand upon the hearth myself！” The effect of the outburst was prodigious．The Burney children said afterwards that it was as good as a comedy．The descendant of the friend of Sir Philip Sidney quailed before the Doctor's glance．All the blood of all the Brookes rallied itself to overcome the insult．The son of a bookseller should be taught his place．Greville did his best to smile — a faint，scoffing smile．He did his best to stand where he had stood the whole evening．He stood smiling，he stood trying to smile，for two or perhaps for three minutes more．But when he looked round the room and saw all eyes cast down，all faces twitching with amusement，all sympathies plainly on the side of the bookseller's son，he could stand there no longer．Fulke Greville slunk away，sloping even his proud shoulders，to a chair．But as he went，he rang the bell “with force”．He demanded his carriage．“The party then broke up；and no one from amongst it ever asked，or wished for its repetition．”





The Niece of an Earl


There is an aspect of fiction of so delicate a nature that less has been said about it than its importance deserves．One is supposed to pass over class distinctions in silence；one person is supposed to be as well born as another；and yet English fiction is so steeped in the ups and downs of social rank that without them it would be unrecognizable．When Meredith，in The Case of General Ople and Lady Camper，remarks，“He sent word that he would wait on Lady Camper immediately，and betook himself forthwith to his toilette．She was the niece of an Earl”，all of British blood accept the statement unhesitatingly，and know that Meredith is right．A General in those circumstances would certainly have given his coat an extra brush．For though the General might have been，we are given to understand that he was not，Lady Camper's social equal．He received the shock of her rank upon a naked surface．No earldom，baronetage，or knighthood protected him．He was an English gentleman merely，and a poor one at that．Therefore，to British readers even now it seems unquestionably fitting that he should “betake himself to his toilette” before appearing in the lady's presence．

It is useless to suppose that social distinctions have vanished．Each may pretend that he knows no such restrictions，and that the compartment in which he lives allows him the run of the world．But it is an illusion．The idlest stroller down summer streets may see for himself the charwoman's shawl shouldering its way among the silk wraps of the successful；he sees shop-girls pressing their noses against the plate glass of motor-cars；he sees radiant youth and august age waiting their summons within to be admitted to the presence of King George．There is no animosity，perhaps，but there is no communication．We are enclosed，and separate，and cut off．Directly we see ourselves in the looking-glass of fiction we know that this is so．The novelist，and the English novelist in particular，knows and delights，it seems，to know that society is a nest of glass boxes one separate from another，each housing a group with special habits and qualities of its own．He knows that there are Earls and that Earls have nieces；he knows that there are Generals and that Generals brush their coats before they visit the nieces of Earls．But this is only the ABC of what he knows．For in a few short pages，Meredith makes us aware not only that Earls have nieces，but that Generals have cousins；that the cousins have friends；that the friends have cooks；that the cooks have husbands，and that the husbands of the cooks of the friends of the cousins of the Generals are carpenters．Each of these people lives in a glass box of his own，and has peculiarities of which the novelist must take account．What appears superficially to be the vast equality of the middle classes is，in truth，nothing of the sort．All through the social mass run curious veins and streakings separating man from man and woman from woman；mysterious prerogatives and disabilities too ethereal to be distinguished by anything so crude as a title impede and disorder the great business of human intercourse．And when we have threaded our way carefully through all these grades from the niece of the Earl to the friend of the cousin of the General，we are still faced with an abyss；a gulf yawns before us；on the other side are the working classes．The writer of perfect judgement and taste，like Jane Austen，does no more than glance across the gulf；she restricts herself to her own special class and finds infinite shades within it．But for the brisk，inquisitive，combative writer like Meredith，the temptation to explore is irresistible．He runs up and down the social scale；he chimes one note against another；he insists that the Earl and the cook，the General and the farmer shall speak up for themselves and play their part in the extremely complicated comedy of English civilized life．

It was natural that he should attempt it．A writer touched by the comic spirit relishes these distinctions keenly；they give him something to take hold of；something to make play with．English fiction without the nieces of Earls and the cousins of Generals would be an arid waste．It would resemble Russian fiction．It would have to fall back upon the immensity of the soul and upon the brotherhood of man．Like Russian fiction，it would lack comedy．But while we realize the immense debt that we owe the Earl's niece and the General's cousin，we doubt sometimes whether the pleasure we get from the play of satire on these broken edges is altogether worth the price we pay．For the price is a high one．The strain upon a novelist is tremendous．In two short stories Meredith gallantly attempts to bridge all gulfs，and to take half a dozen different levels in his stride．Now he speaks as an Earl's niece；now as a carpenter's wife．It cannot be said that his daring is altogether successful．One has a feeling（perhaps it is unfounded）that the blood of the niece of an Earl is not quite so tart and sharp as he would have it．Aristocracy is not，perhaps，so consistently high and brusque and eccentric as，from his angle，he would represent it．Yet his great people are more successful than his humble．His cooks are too ripe and rotund；his farmers too ruddy and earthy．He overdoes the pith and the sap；the fist-shaking and the thigh-slapping．He has got too far from them to write of them with ease．

It seems，therefore，that the novelist，and the English novelist in particular，suffers from a disability which affects no other artist to the same extent．His work is influenced by his birth．He is fated to know intimately，and so to describe with understanding，only those who are of his own social rank．He cannot escape from the box in which he has been bred．A bird's-eye view of fiction shows us no gentlemen in Dickens；no working men in Thackeray．One hesitates to call Jane Eyre a lady．The Elizabeths and the Emmas of Miss Austen could not possibly be taken for anything else．It is vain to look for dukes or for dustmen — we doubt that such extremes are to be found anywhere in fiction．We are，therefore，brought to the melancholy and tantalizing conclusion not only that novels are poorer than they might be，but that we are very largely prevented — for after all，the novelists are the great interpreters — from knowing what is happening either in the heights of society or in its depths．There is practically no evidence available by which we can guess at the feelings of the highest in the land．What does a King feel？What does a Duke think？We cannot say．For the highest in the land have seldom written at all，and have never written about themselves．We shall never know what the Court of Louis XIV looked like to Louis XIV himself．It seems likely indeed that the English aristocracy will pass out of existence，or be merged with the common people，without leaving any true picture of themselves behind．

But our ignorance of the aristocracy is nothing compared with our ignorance of the working classes．At all times the great families of England and France have delighted to have famous men at their tables，and thus the Thackerays and the Disraelis and the Prousts have been familiar enough with the cut and fashion of aristocratic life to write about it with authority．Unfortunately，however，life is so framed that literary success invariably means a rise，never a fall，and seldom，what is far more desirable，a spread in the social scale．The rising novelist is never pestered to come to gin and winkles with the plumber and his wife．His books never bring him into touch with the cat's-meat man，or start a correspondence with the old lady who sells matches and bootlaces by the gate of the British Museum．He becomes rich；he becomes respectable；he buys an evening suit and dines with peers．Therefore，the later works of successful novelists show，if anything，a slight rise in the social scale．We tend to get more and more portraits of the successful and the distinguished．On the other hand，the old rat-catchers and ostlers of Shakespeare's day are shuffled altogether off the scene，or become，what is far more offensive，objects of pity，examples of curiosity．They serve to show up the rich．They serve to point the evils of the social system．They are no longer，as they used to be when Chaucer wrote，simply themselves．For it is impossible，it would seem，for working men to write in their own language about their own lives．Such education as the act of writing implies at once makes them self-conscious，or class-conscious，or removes them from their own class．That anonymity，in the shadow of which writers write most happily，is the prerogative of the middle class alone．It is from the middle class that writers spring，because it is in the middle class only that the practice of writing is as natural and habitual as hoeing a field or building a house．Thus it must have been harder for Byron to be a poet than Keats；and it is as impossible to imagine that a Duke could be a great novelist as that Paradise Lost could be written by a man behind a counter．

But things change；class distinctions were not always so hard and fast as they have now become．The Elizabethan age was far more elastic in this respect than our own；we，on the other hand，are far less hide-bound than the Victorians．Thus it may well be that we are on the edge of a greater change than any the world has yet known．In another century or so，none of these distinctions may hold good．The Duke and the agricultural labourer as we know them now may have died out as completely as the bustard and the wild cat．Only natural differences such as those of brain and character will serve to distinguish us．General Ople（if there are still Generals）will visit the niece（if there are still nieces）of the Earl（if there are still Earls）without brushing his coat（if there are still coats）．But what will happen to English fiction when it has come to pass that there are neither Generals，nieces，Earls，nor coats，we cannot imagine．It may change its character so that we no longer know it．It may become extinct．Novels may be written as seldom and as unsuccessfully by our descendants as the poetic drama by ourselves．The art of a truly democratic age will be — what？
