一、一个帝政时代的老古董


一八四四年十月，有一天下午三点光景，一个六十来岁而看上去要老得多的男人，在意大利大街上走过。他探着鼻子，假作正经地抿着嘴，好像一个商人刚做了笔好买卖，或是一个单身汉沾沾自喜地从内客室走出来。在巴黎，这是一个人把心中的得意流露得最充分的表示。那些每天待在街上，坐在椅子里以打量过路人为消遣的家伙[1]，远远地一瞧见这老人，都透出一点儿巴黎人特有的笑容；这笑容包含许多意思，或是讪笑，或是讽刺，或是同情。可是巴黎人对形形色色的场面也看腻了，一定要遇到头等怪物，脸上才会有点儿表情。

那老头儿在考古学上的价值，以及大家眼中那一点笑意，像回声般一路传过去的笑意，只要一句话就能说明。有人问过以说俏皮话出名的戏子伊阿桑德，他那些博得哄堂大笑的帽子在哪儿定做的。他回答说：“我没有定做啊，只是保存在那儿。”对啦！巴黎上百万的居民其实都可以说是戏子，其中有好多人无意中全做了伊阿桑德，在身上保留着某一时代的一切可笑之处，俨然是整个时代的化身，使你在大街上溜达的时候，便是想着给朋友欺骗那一类的伤心事，也不由得要扑哧一声笑出来。

那过路人的服装，连某些小地方都十足保存着一八〇六年代的款式，所以它让你想起帝政时代而并不觉得有漫画气息。就凭这点儿细腻，有眼光的人才知道这一类令人怀古的景象更有价值。可是要体会那些小枝节，你的分析能力必须像逛马路的老资格一样，如今人家老远看了就笑，可见那走路人必有些怪模怪样。像俗语所说的扑上你的眼睛，那也正是演员们苦心研究，希望一露脸就得个满堂彩的。原来这又干又瘦的老人，在缀着白铜纽扣的、半绿不绿的大褂外面，套着一件没有下摆的栗色短褂，叫作斯宾塞的！……一八四四年上还看到一个穿斯宾塞的男人，岂不像拿破仑复活了一下吗？

顾名思义，斯宾塞的确是那位想卖弄细腰身的英国勋爵的创作。远在一八〇二年亚眠安和会之前，这英国人就把大氅的问题给解决了：既能遮盖胸部，又不至于像笨重而恶俗的卡列克那样埋没一个人的身腰，这种衣服如今只有车行里的老马夫还拿来披在肩上[2]。但因细腰身的人为数不多，所以斯宾塞虽是英国款式，在法国走红的时间也并不久。那些四五十岁的人，看到有人穿着斯宾塞，自然而然会在脑筋里给他补充上一条丝带扎脚的绿短裤，一双翻筒长靴，跟他们年轻的时候一模一样！老太太们见了，也得回想起当年红极一时的盛况。可是一般年轻的人就要觉得奇怪：为什么这个老阿契皮阿特要割掉他外套的尾巴呢[3]？总之，那个人浑身上下都跟斯宾塞配得那么相称，你会毫不犹豫地叫他作帝政时代的人物，正如我们叫什么帝政时代的家具一样。但只有熟悉那个光华灿烂的时代的，至少亲眼见过的人，才会觉得那走路人是帝政时代的象征；因为要辨别服装，必须有相当真切的记忆力。帝政时代跟我们已经离得那么远，要想象它那种法国希腊式[4]的实际场面，绝不是每个人所能办到的。

他帽子戴得很高，差不多把整个的脑门露在外面，这种昂昂然的气概，便是当年的文官和平民特意装出来对抗军人的气焰的。并且那还是一顶十四法郎的怕人的丝帽子，帽檐的反面给又高又大的耳朵印上两个半白不白的、刷也刷不掉的印子。帽坯上照例胶得很马虎的丝片子，好几处都乱糟糟地粘在一块儿，尽管天天早上给修整一次，还像害了大麻风似的。

仿佛要掉下来的帽子底下，露出一张脸，滑稽可笑的模样，唯有中国人才会想出来，去烧成那些丑八怪的瓷器。阔大的麻子脸像个脚炉盖，凹下去的肉窟窿成为许多阴影；高的高，低的低，像罗马人的面具，把解剖学上的规则全打破了。一眼望去，竟找不着脸架子。应当长骨头的地方，却来上一堆果子冻似的肉；该有窝儿的部分，又偏偏鼓起软绵绵的肉疙瘩。这张怪脸给压成了南瓜的形状，配上一对灰眼睛——眉毛的地位只有两道红线——更显得凄凉；整个的脸被一个堂·吉诃德式的鼻子[5]镇住了，像平原上的一座飞来峰。这鼻子，想必塞万提斯也曾注意到，表示一个人天生地热爱一切伟大的事，而结果是着了迷。那副丑相，尽管很滑稽，可绝对不会教人发笑。可怜虫苍白的眼中有一股极凄凉的情调，会教开玩笑的人把到了嘴边的刻薄话重新咽下去。你会觉得造物是不许这老头儿表示什么温情的，要是犯了禁，就得教女人发笑或是难受。看到这种不幸，连法国人也不作声了，他们觉得人生最大的苦难就是不能博得女人的欢心！

二、一套少见的服装


这个在造物前面极不得宠的人，穿得跟清寒的上等人一样，那是有钱人常常模仿的装束。帝国禁卫军式的长筒鞋罩，把鞋子盖住了，使他可以把一双袜子多穿几天。黑呢裤发出好些半红不红的闪光；裁剪的款式，跟褶痕上面又像发白又像发亮的条纹，都证明裤子已经穿了三年。衣衫的宽大并掩饰不了瘦削的体格。他的瘦是天生的，并非学毕太哥尔的样儿而素食的缘故；因为老头儿的嘴巴生得很肉感，嘴唇很厚，笑起来一口牙齿跟鲨鱼的不相上下。大翻领的背心也是黑呢料子的，里头衬一件白背心，还露出第三件红毛线背心的边，教你想起从前迦拉穿到五件背心的故事[1]。白纱的领结，扣得那么有模有样，正是一八〇九年代的漂亮哥儿为了勾引美人儿而苦心推敲的；可是那硕大无朋的领结，拥在下巴前面，似乎把他的脸埋在一个窟窿里。一条编成发辫式的丝表链，穿过背心，拴在衬衫上，仿佛真会有人偷他的表似的！半绿不绿的大褂非常干净，比裤子的年代还要多上三年；丝绒领跟新换过的白铜纽扣，显得穿的人平时的小心简直是无微不至。

把帽子戴在脑后的习惯，三套头的背心，埋没下巴颏儿的大领带，长筒鞋罩，绿色大褂的白铜纽扣，都是帝政时代款式的遗迹；跟这些相配的，还有当年信不信由你的哥儿们[2]那股卖俏的劲儿，衣褶之间那种说不出的细巧，浑身上下那种整齐而呆板的气息，令人想起达维特的画派和约各设计的瘦长家具。只要瞧上一眼，你就会觉得他要不是一个有教养而给什么嗜好断送了的人，便是一个进款不多的家伙，一切开支都是被有限的收入固定了的，万一打破一块玻璃，撕破件衣服，或是碰上募捐等等的要命事儿，就得把他整个月内小小的娱乐取消。你要在场的话，一定觉得奇怪，这张奇丑的脸怎么会浮起一点笑意，它平时的表情不是应当又冷又凄凉，像所有为了挣口苦饭而奋斗的人一样吗？可是这古怪的老人，像母亲保护孩子那么小心，右手拿着件分明很贵重的东西，藏在双重上衣的左襟底下，生怕不巧给人碰坏了：你看到这个，尤其看到他急急忙忙，活像那些有闲的人偶尔替人跑腿的神气，你可能以为他找到了侯爵夫人的小狗什么的，带着帝政时代的人物所有的那种殷勤，得意扬扬地给送回去；他那位上了六十岁的美人儿，还少不了他每天的问候呢。世界上唯有在巴黎才能看到这等景致，大街上就在连续不断地演这种义务戏，让法国人饱了眼福，给艺术家添了资料。

三、一个得罗马奖的人的下场[1]


一看那人瘦骨嶙峋的轮廓，虽然很大胆地穿着过时的斯宾塞，你也不敢把他当作什么艺术家；因为巴黎的艺术家差不多跟巴黎的小孩子一样，在俗人的想象中照例是嘻嘻哈哈，大有“噱头”的家伙，我这么说是因为“噱”这个古字现在又时行了。可是这走路人的确得过头奖，在法国恢复罗马学院之后，第一支受学士院褒奖的诗歌体乐曲，便是他作的。一句话说完，他就是西尔伐·邦斯先生！……他写了不少有名的感伤歌曲，给我们的母亲辈浅吟低唱过，也作过一八一五与一八一六年间上演的两三出歌剧，跟一些未曾刊行的乐曲。临了，这老实人只能替大街上一所戏院当乐队指挥；又凭着他那张脸，在几处女子私塾内当教员。薪水和学费便是他全部的收入。唉！到了这个年纪还得为了几文学费而到处奔跑！……这种很少传奇意味的生活，原来还藏着多少的神秘哟！

因此，这个穿斯宾塞的老古董不单是帝政时代的象征，三套头的背心上还大书特书地标着一个教训。他告诉你“会考”那个可怕的制度害了多少人，他自己便是一个榜样。那制度在法国行了一百年没有效果，可是至今还在继续。这种挤逼一个人聪明才智的玩意儿，原是蓬巴杜夫人的弟弟，一七四六年左右的美术署署长波阿松·特·玛里尼想出来的。一百年来得奖的人里头出了几个天才，你们屈指数一数吧！首先，伟人的产生是可遇而不可求的，在行政或学制方面费多大的劲，也代替不了那些奇迹。在一切生殖的神秘中，这是连野心勃勃，以分析逞能的近代科学也没法分析的。其次，孵化小鸡的暖灶据说当初是埃及人发明的；倘若有了这发明而不马上拿食料去喂那些孵出来的小鸡，你对埃及人又将作何感想？法国政府可就是这么办：它想把“会考”当作暖房一般去培养艺术家；赶到这机械的方法把画家、雕塑家、镂版家、音乐家制造出来以后，它就不再关心，好比公子哥儿一到晚上就不在乎他拴在纽孔上的鲜花一样。而真有才气的人倒是格勒兹、华多、法利西安·达维特、巴涅齐、奚里谷、特刚、奥贝、达维特·特·安越、欧也纳·特拉克洛阿、曼索尼哀等等[2]，他们并不把什么头奖放在心上，只照着那个无形的太阳（它的名字叫作天生的倾向）的光，在大地上欣欣向荣地生长。

政府把西尔伐·邦斯送往罗马，想教他成为一个大音乐家，他却在那儿养成了爱古物爱美术品的癖。凡是手和头脑产生的杰作，近来的俗语统称为古董的，他都非常内行。所以这音乐家一八一〇年回到巴黎的时候，变了个贪得无厌的收藏家，带回许多油画，小人像，画框，象牙的和木头的雕刻，五彩的珐琅，瓷器等等；买价跟运费，使他在留学期间把父亲大部分的遗产花光了。在罗马照规矩待了三年，他又漫游意大利，把母亲的遗产也照式照样地花完了。他要很悠闲地到威尼斯、米兰、佛罗伦萨、博洛尼亚、那不勒斯各处去观光，以艺术家那种无愁无虑的性情，像梦想者与哲学家一般在每个城里逗留一番——至于将来的生计，他觉得只要靠自己的本领就行了，正如娼妓们拿姿色看作吃饭的本钱。那次奇妙的游历使邦斯快活之极；一个心灵伟大，感觉敏锐，因为生得奇丑而不能像一八〇九年的那句老话所说的，博得美人青睐的人，他所能得到的幸福，在那次旅行中可以说达到了最高峰。他觉得人生实际的东西都比不上他理想的典型；内心的声音跟现实的声音不调和，可是他对这一点早已满不在乎。在他心中保存着很纯粹很强烈的审美感，使他作了些巧妙、细腻、优雅的歌曲，在一八一〇至一八一四年间很有点名气。在法国，凡是靠潮流靠巴黎一时的狂热捧起来的那种声名，就会造成邦斯一流的人。要说对伟大的成就如此严厉，而对渺小的东西如此宽容的，世界上没有一国可与法国相比。德国音乐的巨潮和罗西尼的洋洋大作不久就把邦斯淹没了；一八二四年时，凭他最后几支歌曲，还有人知道他是个有趣的音乐家，可是你想，到一八三一年他还剩点儿什么！再到一八四四年，在他默默无闻的生涯中仅有的一幕戏开场的时候，西尔伐·邦斯的价值只像洪水以前的一个小音符了；虽然他还替自己服务的戏院和几家邻近的戏院以很少的报酬为戏剧配乐，音乐商已经完全不知道有他这个人了。

可是这好好先生倒很赏识近代的名家，倘使有些优秀作品给美满地演奏出来，他会下泪；但他的崇拜，并不像霍夫曼小说中的克雷斯勒那样的如醉若狂，他表面上绝不流露，只在心中自得其乐，像那些抽鸦片吸麻醉品的人。唯一能使凡夫俗子与大诗人并肩的那种敬仰与了解，在巴黎极难遇到，一切思潮在那儿仅仅像旅客一般地稍作勾留，所以邦斯是值得我们钦佩的了。他不曾走红仿佛有点说不过去，可是他很天真地承认，在和声方面他差着点儿，没有把对位学研究到家；倘若再下一番新功夫，他可能在现代作曲家中占一席之地，当然不是成为罗西尼，而是哀洛一流[3]；但规模越来越大的配器法使他觉得无从下手。并且，收藏家的喜悦，也把他的不能享有盛名大大地补偿了，倘若要他在收藏的古董与罗西尼的荣名之间挑一项的话，你爱信不信，他竟会挑上他心爱的珍品的。那收藏名贵版画的、博学的希那华说过，他拿一张雷斯达尔、霍贝玛、荷尔拜因、穆立罗、格勒兹、塞巴斯蒂亚诺·德·皮翁博、乔尔乔内、拉斐尔、丢勒的画欣赏的时候，非要那张画是只花五十法郎买来的，才更觉得津津有味。邦斯也是这个主张，他决不买一百法郎以上的东西；而要他肯花五十法郎，那东西非值三千不可；他认为世上值到三百法郎的神品久已绝迹。机会是极难得的，但他具备三大成功的条件——像鹿一般会跑的腿，逛马路的闲工夫，犹太人那样的耐性。

这套办法，在罗马，在巴黎，行了四十年，大有成绩。回国以后每年花上两千法郎的结果，邦斯谁也不让看见地，藏着各种各样的精品，目录的编号到了惊人的一千九百零七号。一八一一至一八一六年间，他在巴黎城中到处奔跑的时候，如今值一千二的东西，他花十法郎就弄到了。其中有的是画，在巴黎市场上每年流通的四万五千幅中挑出来的；有的是塞夫勒窑软坯的瓷器，从奥弗涅人手中买来的；这些人是囤货商的爪牙，把蓬巴杜式的法国美术品用小车从各地载到巴黎来。总之，他搜集十七十八世纪的遗物，发掘一般有才气有性灵的法国艺术家，例如不出名的大师勒包脱勒，拉华莱-波尚之类；他们创造了路易十五式、路易十六式的风格，给现代艺术家整天待在博物院图版室中改头换面、自命为新创的式样做蓝本。邦斯还有好多藏品是跟人交换来的，这是收藏家无可形容的喜悦！买古董的快乐只能放在第二位；交换古董，在手里进进出出，才是第一乐事。邦斯是最早收鼻烟壶跟小型画像的人[4]。但他在玩古董的人中并不知名，因为他不上拍卖行，也不在有名的铺子里露脸，这样他也就不知道他的宝物的时值估价了。

收藏家中的巨擘杜索末拉，曾经想接近这位音乐家，但杜氏没有能进入邦斯美术馆就故世了；而邦斯美术馆，是唯一能和有名的索华育的收藏媲美的[5]。他们俩颇有相像的地方：两人都是音乐家，都没有什么财产，用同样的方法收藏，爱好艺术，痛恨有名的富翁与商人们抬价。对一切手工艺，一切神妙的制作，索华育是邦斯的对头、敌手、竞争者。跟他一样，邦斯的心永远不知餍足，对美术品的爱好正如情人爱一个美丽的情妇；守斋街上的拍卖行内，作品在估价员的锤子声中卖来卖去，他觉得简直是罪大恶极、侮辱古董的行为。他的美术馆是给自己时时刻刻享受的。生来崇拜大作品的心灵，真有大情人那样奇妙的天赋；他们今天的快乐不会比昨日的减少一点，从来不会厌倦，而可喜的是杰作也永远不会老。所以那天他像父亲抱着孩子般拿着的东西，一定是偶然碰上的什么宝物，那种欢天喜地拿着就走的心情，你们鉴赏家自然能领会到！

看了这段小传的第一道轮廓，大家一定会叫起来：“哦！别瞧他生得丑，倒是世界上最幸福的人呢！”不错，一个人染上了一种嗜好，什么烦恼，什么无名的愁闷，都再也伤害不到他的心。你们之中凡是没法再喝到欢乐的美酒的人，不妨想法去搅上一个收藏的瘾，不管收什么（连招贴都有人在收集呢！）；那时你即使没有整个儿的幸福，至少能得些零星的喜悦。所谓好癖，就是快感的升华。话虽如此，你们可不必艳羡邦斯；要是你们存下这种心，那就跟其他类似的情操一样，必然是由于误会的缘故了。

这个人，感觉那么灵敏，一颗心老在欣赏人类美妙的制作，欣赏人与造化争奇的奋斗，他可是犯了七大罪恶中上帝惩罚最轻的一桩，换句话说，邦斯是好吃的[6]。既没有多少钱，再加上玩古董的瘾，饮食就不能不清苦，使他那张挑精拣肥的嘴巴受不了。先是单身汉天天在外边吃人家的，把饮食问题给解决了。帝政时代，仰慕名流的风气远过于现在，大概因为那时名流不多，又没有什么政治野心。一个人不用费多大气力，就能成为诗人、作家或音乐家。邦斯当时被认为可能和尼科罗、巴哀、裴尔登[7]等等抗衡的，所以收到的请帖之多，甚至要在日记簿上登记下来，像律师登记案子一样。他以艺术家的身份出去周旋，拿自己作的歌谱送给饭局的主人们，在他们家弹弹钢琴，把他服务的法杜戏院的包厢票请客，替人家凑几个音乐会，有时还在亲戚家的临时舞会中拉提琴。

四、好事有时候是白做的


那时法兰西最健美的男儿，正在跟联盟国最健美的男儿一刀一枪地厮杀[1]；因此，按照埃里安德的理论，邦斯的丑陋被称为别具一格[2]。他替什么美丽的太太办了一点事，人家会叫他一声“可爱的人”，但他的安慰也不过是这句空话而已。

在这一段约莫有六年（一八一〇至一八一六）的时间内，邦斯搅上了好吃好喝的坏习惯，眼看请他吃饭的主人们那么豪爽，端出时鲜的菜，开出顶好的酒；点心，咖啡，饭后酒，无一不讲究。帝政时代就有这种好客的风气；正当多少的国王王后云集巴黎的时候，大家都模仿他们光华显赫的气派。当时的人喜欢学帝王的样，正如现在的人喜欢学国会的样，成立好多有会长、副会长、秘书等等的团体，例如苎麻研究会、葡萄改良会、蚕种研究会、农业会、工业会，形形色色，不一而足；有人还在寻访社会的烂疮，把良医国手组成团体呢！

再说邦斯吧。受过这种训练的胃，必然影响到一个人的气节；对烹调的了解越深刻，志气也就越消沉。肉欲盘踞着你整个的心，在那里发号施令，意志和荣誉都给打得粉碎；它要你不惜牺牲使它满足。口腹之欲的专横，从来没有被描写过，因为每个人都得生存，所以连文学批评都把它放过了。但为了吃喝而断送掉的人，你真想象不到有多少。在巴黎，以倾家荡产而论，饮食等于在跟娼妓竞争；并且在另一方面看，一个人的吃是收入，嫖是支出。赶到邦斯因艺术家身份的低落，从无席不与的上宾降而为吃白食的清客的时候，他已经没法离开精美的筵席，跑进四十铜子一餐的饭店去尝斯巴达式[3]的牛奶蛋花羹。可怜他一想到要独立就得作那么大的牺牲，他就发抖，他觉得什么下贱的事都能做，只要能继续好吃好喝，按时按节尝到当今的珍馐美果，吃着精致的名菜大快朵颐！他仿佛觅食的鸟，含了满嘴的食物高飞远走，只要嘁嘁喳喳唱上一支歌就算道谢。并且那么好的酒饭都吃在人家头上，吃完了扯个鬼脸就跑，邦斯也觉得相当得意。跟所有的单身汉一样，他怕待在家里，喜欢老混在别人府上；凡是应酬场中的门面话，没有真情的假殷勤，他都习惯了，他也学会了把客套随口敷衍；至于看人，他只看个表面，从来不想去摸清底细。

这个勉强过得去的阶段又拖了十年，可那是怎样的十年呵！简直是风风雨雨的秋天。邦斯尽量巴结那些走熟了的家庭，以便保住饭桌上的地位。终于他走上了末路，替人当差，跑腿，几次三番地代替用人和门房的职司。多少买卖都由这一个家庭派他到另一家庭中去探听消息，做个并无恶意的间谍；可是他跑了那么多回腿，当了那么些有失身份的差使，人家并不感激他。

“邦斯是个单身汉，”人家说，“他无聊得很，能够替我们跑跑才高兴呢……要不然他怎么办？”

不久他开始散布出老年人的那点儿凉意，像北风一般把人家的感情都吹凉了，尤其他是个又穷又丑的老人，那不是老上加老吗？这是人生到了冬季，鼻子通红，腮帮灰白，手脚麻木的冬季！

一八三六年至一八四三年之间，邦斯难得有人请吃饭了。每个家庭都不想再找他，他要上门，就耐着性子耽待他，像忍受捐税一样。大家觉得没有欠他一点儿情，甚至也不把他真正出过力的事放在心上。老人在那里混了一世的几个家庭，都不是尊重艺术的，他们只崇拜成功，只重视一八三〇年以后得来的果实：财富或地位。既然邦斯在思想上举动上都不够气魄，没有那种教布尔乔亚敬畏的聪明或才气，结果他当然变得一文不值，只是还不至于完全被人唾弃罢了。但他跟一切懦弱的人一样，受了社会的白眼不敢说出来。慢慢地他学会了把情感压在胸中，把自己的心当作一个避难所。好多浅薄的人，管这个现象叫作自私自利。孤独的人与自私的人的确很相像，使一般说长道短之辈毁谤好人的话，显得凿凿有据，尤其在巴黎，没有人肯用心观察，一切都快得像潮水，昙花一现像内阁！

所以，人家在背后责备邦斯自私，而邦斯也就给这个罪名压倒了，因为你一朝加了人家罪名，结果终会把它坐实的。诬蔑给一般懦弱的人多大的打击，可有人想到过？谁又会描写他们的痛苦？这个一天天恶化的局面，说明了可怜的音乐家脸上的悲苦；他的生活是以可耻的牺牲换来的。可是为了嗜好而做的丢人的事，反而加强你对嗜好的联系；越需要你卑躬屈膝的嗜好，你越觉得宝贵；你会把所有的牺牲看作消极的储蓄，仿佛有无穷的财富在内。譬如说，给有钱的浑蛋极不客气地瞪上一眼之后，邦斯津津有味地呷着波特酒，嚼着焗鹌鹑，像出了一口怨气似的，心里想：“总算还划得来！”

在伦理学家心目中，他这种生活是情有可原的。人必须在某方面有点满足才能活。一个毫无嗜好，完全合乎中庸之道的人，简直是妖魔，是没有翅膀的半吊子天使。基督旧教的神话里，天使没有别的，只有头脑。但在我们的浊世上，所谓完人便是那迂腐的格兰狄逊[4]，连街头的神女对他也不成其为女性的。而邦斯，除了漫游意大利的时期，大概靠气候帮忙而有过一两次平凡的艳遇以外，从来没看见女人对他笑过。好多人都遭到这一类的厄运。邦斯是天生的丑八怪，当初他父母是晚年得子，诞生既过了时令，他自有那些过了时令的瘢痕，例如死尸一般的皮色，很像在科学家保存怪胎的酒精瓶里培养出来的。这位艺术家，生成一颗温柔的心，有幻想，有感觉，却为了一副尊容不得不过那种生活，绝无希望得到女人的爱。可见他的独身并非由于自己喜欢，而是迫不得已。赶到饕餮来勾引他，他就奋不顾身地扑上去，像当年奋不顾身地崇拜艺术品和音乐一样；好吃的罪过，不是连有道行的僧侣都难免吗[5]？为他，珍馐美食与古董代替了女人；因为音乐是他的本行，而世界上哪有人喜欢他挣饭吃的本行的？职业有如婚姻，久而久之，大家只觉得它有弊无利。

布里亚·萨瓦兰在《食欲心理学》一书中有心替老饕张目，但对于人在饮食方面真正的快乐，似乎还说得不够。消化食物，需要不少精力，那是一场内部的战斗，对那些供养口腹的人，其快感竟不下于爱情。一个人只觉得生命力在那儿尽量发挥，头脑不再活动而让位给横隔膜那边的第二头脑，同时所有的机能都麻痹，使你入于完全陶醉的境界。便是巨蟒吧，它吞了一头公牛，就会瘫倒在那里任人宰割。一过四十岁，谁还敢吃饱了饭马上工作？……因此，所有的大人物对饮食都是有节制的。大病初愈的人，精美的食物给限制得很严，他们往往觉得吃到一只鸡翅膀就能迷迷糊糊地愣个大半天。安分老实的邦斯，一切乐趣都集中在胃的活动上，所以他老像病后的人，希望凡是珍馐美食所能给他的快感都能享受到，而至此为止他的确每天享受到。可是世界上就没有一个人有断瘾的勇气。好多自杀的人临死都改变了主意，因为丢不下每天晚上去玩“接龙”的咖啡馆。

五、一对榛子钳[1]


一八三五年，邦斯的不获美人青睐，意外地得到补偿，他像俗语所说的有了一根老年的拐杖。这个一生下来就老的人，居然从友谊中获得人生的依傍；社会既不容许他结婚，他便跟一个男人结合——也是个老头儿，也是个音乐家。倘使拉·封丹不曾写下那篇奇妙的寓言，我这本小传大可题作两位朋友[2]。但亵渎名著的行为，不是一切真正的作家都应当避免的吗？咱们的寓言家既然把心中的秘密和梦境写成了一篇杰作，那题目就应该永远归他。因为这首诗简直是一份神圣的产业，一所庙堂，前面像榜额似的标着两位朋友几个大字，将来每一代的人，全世界的人，都得恭恭敬敬进去瞻礼一番，只要有印刷术存在。

邦斯的朋友是钢琴教授。两人的生活，人品，都非常调和，使邦斯大有相见恨晚之慨，因为他们直到一八三四年，方才在某个私塾的给奖典礼上认识。在违背了上帝的意旨，发源于伊甸园的茫茫人海中[3]，两颗这样心心相印的灵魂恐怕是从来未有的。没有多少时候，两位音乐家变得你少不了我，我少不了你。彼此的信任，使他们在八天之内就跟亲兄弟一般。许模克简直不相信世界上会有一个邦斯，邦斯也不信世界上会有一个许模克。这几句已经把两个好人形容得够了。可是大众的头脑不一定喜欢简单的综合手法。为一般不肯轻易相信的人，必须再轻描淡写地说明一番。

这钢琴家是个德国人，像伟大的门德尔松般的德国人，像史丹贝脱般的德国人，像特莱旭克、希勒、曼尔、克兰茂、齐茂曼、卡克勃兰纳、埃士、胡兹、卡尔、伏尔夫、比克齐斯、克拉拉·维克般的德国人[4]，尤其是像所有的德国人。虽是大作曲家，许模克只能做一个演奏家，因为他天生缺少胆气，而天才要在音乐上有所表现，就靠有胆气。好多德国人的天真并不能维持到老；倘使在相当的年龄上还有天真，那是像我们从河中引水灌田一般，特意从青春的泉源上汲取得来，使他们能够在科学、艺术或金钱方面有所成就的；因为天真可以祛除人家的疑心。为了这个目的，法国有些刁滑的家伙，用巴黎小商人的鄙俗来代替德国人的天真。可是许模克无意之中把童年的天真全部保存着，正如邦斯保存着帝政时代的遗迹。这高尚而地道的德国人，是演员而兼观众；他玩音乐玩给自己听。他住在巴黎好比一只夜莺住在森林里，孤独无偶地唱了二十年，直到遇见邦斯，才有了个跟自己的化身一样的伴侣。（参看《夏娃的女儿》[5] [6]）

邦斯和许模克两人的性格与感情，都有德国人那种婆婆妈妈的孩子气：例如爱花成癖，爱一切天然景致，在园子里砌些玻璃瓶底，把眼前大块文章的风景，缩成了小规模来欣赏[7]；又如探求真理的脾气，使一个日耳曼学者穿着长筒靴，走上几百里地去寻访一点事实，而那事实就在院子的素馨花下，蹲在井栏旁边瞅着他笑；再如他们对微不足道的小事都需要找出一个形而上的意义，从而产生了李赫忒那种不可解的作品，霍夫曼那种荒诞不经的故事，和德国印行的那些救世济人的巨著，把芝麻绿豆的问题看作幽深玄妙，当作深渊一般的发掘，而掘到末了，一切都是德国人的捕风捉影。

两人都是旧教徒，他们一同去望弥撒，奉行宗教仪式，可是跟儿童一样，根本没有什么可以向忏悔师说的。他们深信音乐是天国的语言，思想与情感还不能代表音乐，正如语言的不能完全表达思想与情感。因此，他们之间拿音乐来代替谈话，一问一答，可以无穷无尽地谈下去。而所谓谈话，无非像情人似的，加强自己胸中的信念。许模克的心不在焉，和邦斯的处处留神，正好异曲同工。邦斯是收藏家，许模克是幻想家：一个忙着抢救物质的美，一个专心研究精神的美。邦斯瞅着一只小瓷杯想买，许模克却在一旁擤着鼻子，想着罗西尼、贝里尼、贝多芬、莫扎特的某一个主题，推敲这乐句的动机是什么一种情操，或者它的下文又该是什么一种情操。许模克的理财原则是漠不关心，邦斯是为了嗜好而挥霍，结果殊途同归：每年十二月三十一日，两人的荷包里都一文不剩。

要没有这番友谊，邦斯也许早已悲伤得支持不住；但一朝有了一颗心可以倾诉自己的心，他日子又过得下去了。他第一次把痛苦倒在许模克心中的时候，淳朴的德国人便劝他，与其受那么大的委屈去吃人家的，不如和他一样在家里吃点面包跟乳酪。可怜邦斯不敢对许模克说出来：他的胃跟心是死冤家，凡是教心受不了的事，胃都满不在乎，它不惜任何代价要有一顿好饭尝尝，仿佛一个多情男子需要有个情妇给他……调戏调戏。日子一久，许模克终于了解了邦斯，因为他是十足地道的德国人，看事情不像法国人那样快；可是这样他倒反更喜爱邦斯了。要交情坚固，最好两个朋友中有一个自命为比另一个高明。许模克一发觉朋友的口腹之欲那么强，不由得在旁搓搓手，这种表情便是天使也不能加以责备。第二天，好心的德国人亲自去买了些精致的饭菜，把他们的中饭点缀一下，并且从那天起，他想法每天给朋友换口味；因为从他们同居之后，午饭总是一同在家里吃的。

巴黎人爱讥讽的脾气是对什么都不留情的。倘以为这一对朋友能够幸免，那真是不认识巴黎了。许模克与邦斯，把各人精神的财富与物质的艰苦合在一块儿之后，想出个经济办法，在玛莱区幽静的诺曼底街上一幢幽静的屋子内，合租了一所公寓，虽然房间的分配很不平均，房租是各半负担的。他们常常一同出去，肩并肩地老走着同样几条大街，逛马路的闲人便替他们起了一个诨名，叫作“一对榛子钳”。有了这个绰号，我不必再描写许模克的面貌了，他之于邦斯，正如梵蒂冈的尼俄伯像之于米洛斯的维纳斯像[8]。

一对榛子钳家中的杂务，都以看门的西卜太太为中心。在这一幕使两老的生涯急转直下的悲剧中，西卜太太担任极重要的角色，所以她的面貌且待她登场的时候再描写。

关于两人的心境，还有一点需要说明。但这正是最不容易教一八四七年上的百分之九十九的读者了解的，不了解的原因或许在于铁路的勃兴使金融有了空前的发展。路局不是发行股票，借大家的钱吗？好吧，礼尚往来，让我们向它借用一个形象来做譬喻。列车在铁路上驶过的时候，不是有无数绝细的灰土在轨道上飞扬吗？那些在旅客眼中看不见的沙粒，要是飞进了旅客的肾脏，他们就要有剧烈的痛楚，害那个叫作石淋的可怕的病，而且是致命的。我们的社会正以火车一样的速度在钢轨上飞奔，它对于那些看不见的细沙是毫不介意的，可是灰土随时随地都在飞进那两位朋友的身体，使他们仿佛心脏里面生了结石[9]。他们对旁人的痛苦已经非常敏感，往往为了爱莫能助而在暗中难受，对自己身受的刺激当然更敏感到近于病态的地步。尽管到了老年，尽管连续不断地看到巴黎的悲剧，两颗年轻、天真、纯洁的心，始终没有变硬。他们俩越活下去，内心的痛苦越尖锐。凡是有操守的人，冷静的思想家，生活谨严的真正的诗人，不幸都是如此。

两老同居以后，因为职业相仿，起居行动像巴黎出租马车的牲口一样，自有一种同甘共苦的友爱的气息。不分冬夏，两人都七时起身，吃过早点，分头到各个私塾去教课，必要时也互相替代。到了中午，逢到排戏的日子，邦斯便上戏院去，所有空闲的时间他都在街上溜达。然后，两人到晚上又在戏院里见面，那是邦斯把许模克荐进去的。下面我们就得把推荐的经过说一说。

六、一个到处看得见的被剥削者


邦斯认识许模克的时候，刚当上乐队指挥，那在一个无名的作曲家真是达到登峰造极的地位了！他并没钻谋，而是当时的部长包比诺送给他的人情。靠七月革命发迹的商界豪杰[1]，手头恰好有所戏院，又恰好碰上一个老朋友，一个会教暴发户脸红的朋友，便把戏院交给了他。包比诺伯爵，有一天在车中瞥见那个青年时代的老伙计，狼狈不堪地在街上走，鞋袜不全，穿着件说不出什么颜色的大褂，探着鼻子，仿佛想凭几个小本钱找些大生意做做。那朋友叫作高狄沙，跑街出身，当年对包比诺大字号的兴发很出过一番力。包比诺封了伯爵，进了贵族院，当了两任部长，可并没翻脸不认人。不但如此，他还想让跑街添点服装，捞点儿钱。平民宫廷的政治与虚荣[2]，倒不曾使老药材商的心变质。色眯眯的高狄沙，听到有所破产的戏院，便想拿过来；部长给了他戏院，又介绍给他几位老风流做股东，都是相当有钱，能够做女戏子们的后台的。邦斯既是部长府上的食客，部长就把他的名字交了下去。高狄沙公司开张之后，居然很发达，一八三四年上又有了个大计划，想在大街上搅些通俗歌剧。芭蕾舞跟神幻剧的音乐[3]，需要有个过得去而且还能写点曲子的乐队指挥。高狄沙接手以前，经理部因为亏本，久已不雇用抄谱员。邦斯便介绍许模克去专管乐谱，虽是起码行业，可非有点音乐的真本领不行。许模克听了邦斯出的主意，跟喜歌剧院的乐谱主任联络之下，无须再照顾刻板工作。两个朋友合作的结果非常圆满。像所有的德国人一样，许模克的和声学功夫极深，总谱的配器工作由他一手包办了去，邦斯只管写调子。他们替两三出走红的戏所配的音乐，颇有些新鲜的段落，得到知音的听众赞赏，但他们以为这是时代的进步，从来不想追究作者姓甚名谁。因此，像戏池里的人看不见楼厅的观众一样，没有人看见邦斯和许模克有什么光荣。在巴黎，尤其从一八三〇年起，要不是千方百计，以九牛二虎之力，把大批竞争的同业排挤掉，谁也休想出头；而这是需要强壮的身体的；两位朋友既然心里长了那块结石，怎么还会有气力去为功名活动呢？

邦斯平时要八点左右才上戏院，那是正戏开场的时间，而正戏的前奏曲和伴奏，都非有严格的指挥不可。小戏院对这些事多半很马虎；邦斯因为从来不跟经理部计较什么，行动更可以随便，并且必要时还能由许模克代庖。一来二去，许模克在乐队里的地位稳固了。高狄沙嘴里不说，心里很明白邦斯的副手是有本领的，有用处的。潮流所趋，人们不得不学大戏院的样，在乐队里添架钢琴放在指挥台旁边，由义务的助理指挥许模克义务弹奏。当大家把没有野心没有架子的老实的德国人认识清楚之后，所有的音乐师都拿他当自己人看待。经理部开发一份很少的薪水，把小戏院不备而有时非用不可的乐器，统统交给他担任，例如钢琴、七弦竖琴、英国号角、大提琴、竖琴、西班牙响板、串铃、竖笛，等等。德国人不会运用“自由”的武器，可是天生地能演奏所有的乐器。

两个老艺术家在戏院里人缘极好；他们对什么事情都像哲学家一样有着洒脱的态度，闭着眼睛，不愿意看任何戏班子都免不了的弊病。譬如说，为了增加收入而把跳舞团跟剧团混在一起的时候，就有种种麻烦事儿，叫经理、编剧和乐师们头疼。可是谦和的邦斯，凭他洁身自好与尊重旁人的作风，博得了大众的敬意。再说，一清如水的生活，诚实不欺的性格，在无论哪个阶层里，即使心术最坏的人也会对之肃然起敬。在巴黎，真正的道德，跟一颗大钻石或珍奇的宝物一样受人欣赏。没有一个演员，一个编剧，一个舞女——不管她怎样的无赖——敢对邦斯和许模克捣鬼或搅什么缺德的玩意儿的。邦斯有时还在后台出现，许模克却只认识从戏院边门通往乐队的地下甬道。休息时间，德国老头偶尔对池子里瞧一眼，向一个吹笛子的、生在斯特拉斯堡而原籍德国凯尔的乐师，打听那些月楼上的怪人物是什么来历。许模克天真的头脑，从笛师那儿受了一番社会教育之后，对于众口喧传的交际花，朝三暮四的姘居生活，红角儿的挥霍，女案目的舞弊，慢慢地也觉得真有可能了。无伤大雅的放荡，这老实人已经认为糜烂的大都会生活中最要不得的罪恶，他听了笑笑，仿佛是海外奇谈，无法相信的。精明的读者，当然懂得邦斯和许模克照时髦的说法是受人剥削的；不错，他们在金钱上是吃了亏，但在人家的尊敬和态度上占了便宜。

高狄沙公司靠了某一出芭蕾舞剧的走红而很快地赚了钱之后，经理们送了一组银铸的人像给邦斯，据说是却里尼的作品，价值的惊人竟成为后台的谈话资料。原来人家花了一千两百法郎！好好先生一定要把礼物退回。高狄沙费了多少口舌才硬要他收下了。

“唉！咱们要找到像他这样的演员才好呢！”高狄沙对股东们说。

两位朋友的共同生活，表面上那么恬静，唯一的扰乱是邦斯不惜任何牺牲的那个癖；他无论如何非在别人家里吃晚饭不可。每逢他穿衣服而许模克恰好在家的时候，德国人总得对这个要命的习惯慨叹一番。

“要是他吃得胖些倒还罢了！”他常常这么说。

而许模克一心希望能有个办法，治好朋友那个可耻的恶习；因为真正的朋友在精神方面的感应，和狗的嗅觉一样灵敏；他们能体会到朋友的悲伤，猜到悲伤的原因，老在心里牵挂着。

许模克虽然丑得可怕，还有股恬静出世的气息给冲淡一下；可是邦斯以纯粹法国人的性格，罗曼蒂克的气质，眉宇之间就没有那种风采。你们想吧，他右手小指上还戴着一只钻戒，那在帝政时代还过得去，到了今日岂不显得可笑？德国人看到朋友满面愁容的表情，知道他吃白食的角色越来越当不下去了。一八四四年十月，邦斯能够去吃饭的人家已经很有限。可怜的乐队指挥只能在亲戚中间走动，并且，我们在下文可以看到，他把亲戚两字的意义也应用得太广了。

从前在蒲陶南街上做绸缎生意的富商加缪索，前妻娶的是邦斯的嫡堂姊妹，一个有钱的独养女儿。她的父亲和邦斯的父亲便是供应内廷的刺绣商，有名的邦斯兄弟。音乐家邦斯的父母都是那铺子的合伙老板。一七八九年大革命之前创设的刺绣工场，到一八一五年上，由加缪索太太的父亲盘给了列凡先生。退休将近十年的加缪索，一八四四年时当了国会议员，厂商公会的委员。因为加缪索一族的人对邦斯很好，邦斯便自认为跟加缪索后妻所生的孩子也是甥舅，其实他们之间一点亲戚关系都谈不上。

加缪索的填房是加陶家的小姐，邦斯既是加缪索的舅子，连带就跟加陶家认了亲戚。加陶也是一个布尔乔亚大族，近亲远戚之多，使他们的势力不下于加缪索家族。加缪索后妻的兄弟加陶公证人，太太是娶希弗维尔家的，大名鼎鼎的希弗维尔是化学业的巨头，和安赛默·包比诺有姻亲。大家知道[4]，包比诺在药材批发业中称霸的时期很久，又给七月革命捧上了台，成为拥护路易·菲利普的中心人物。邦斯附着加缪索与加陶的骥尾，闯入了希弗维尔家；又从希弗维尔家一溜溜进了包比诺家：说起来，他到处是舅子的舅子。

我们知道了老音乐家的这些亲戚关系，便可懂得他怎么在一八四四年上还会有人很亲昵地招待他：第一位是包比诺伯爵，贵族院议员，前任农商部部长；第二位是加陶，退休的公证人，现任巴黎某区的区长兼国会议员；第三位是老加缪索，国会议员，厂商公会的委员，未来的贵族院议员；第四位是加缪索·特·玛维尔，老加缪索前妻所生的儿子，也就是邦斯唯一的、真正的嫡堂外甥。

小加缪索为了跟父亲和后母所生的兄弟们有所区别，在姓氏后面加上一处田产的名字——玛维尔。一八四四年时，他是巴黎高等法院的一个庭长。

加陶公证人的女儿，嫁给受盘加陶事务所的后任贝蒂哀。邦斯自命为加陶事务所的一分子，理当一并移交，去做贝蒂哀家的座上客。在那边吃饭的权利，照邦斯说来是有老公证人为证的。

这个布尔乔亚的天地，便是邦斯所谓的亲属，也就是他千辛万苦保留着一份刀叉的人家。

那些人家中间，加缪索庭长照理应当是待他最好的，而他也特别巴结这一家。不幸，庭长夫人——她的父亲蒂里翁是路易十八与查理十世的传达官——对丈夫的舅舅从来没有表示过殷勤。邦斯白白地费了不少时间去奉承她，义务教加缪索小姐弹琴，可是他没法把那个头发半红不红的姑娘造成一个音乐家。本书开场的时候，他正捧着一件宝物要到外甥家里去。玛维尔府上庄严的绿幔子，淡褐色的糊壁花绸，椅子上的丝绒面，古板的家具，屋子里一派森严的法官气息，老是使邦斯心虚胆怯，仿佛走进了杜伊勒里宫。奇怪的是他在城墙街包比诺公馆，因为屋里摆满了艺术品，倒觉得很自在；原来前任部长自从进了政界以后，忽然风雅成癖，也许他在政治上搅的丑事太多了，需要收集一些美妙的艺术品调剂一下。

七、收藏家的得意


玛维尔庭长住在汉诺威街，屋子是十年前庭长太太在父母去世之后买下来的。蒂里翁老夫妇大约有十五万法郎的积蓄留给女儿。屋子在街上坐南朝北；外表有点儿阴气；但靠院子的一边是朝南的，院子尽头有座相当美丽的花园。法官住着整个的二层楼，从前是路易十五时代一个极有势力的银行家住过的。三楼租给一位有钱的老太太。整幢屋子又幽静又体面，刚好符合法官的身份。玛维尔乡下那块良田，当初还剩下一部分没有受主，庭长把二十年的积蓄，凑上母亲的遗产，去买了一个年收一万二的农场，一所别墅，那种壮丽的古迹如今在诺曼底还能看到。别墅四周还有个一百亩的大花园。这规模今日之下已经近乎王侯气派了。庭长为了别墅和花园每年得花上三千法郎，把庄园的净收入减到九千。九千之外，再加他的薪俸，一年的进款统共是二万左右，表面上应当是足够的了，尤其他的嫡母只生他一个，父亲方面的遗产将来还有半数可得。但巴黎的开销和因地位关系不得不撑的场面，使玛维尔夫妇差不多把每年的进款花得一文不剩。到一八三四年为止，他们一向是手头很紧的。

这笔账可以说明二十三岁的玛维尔小姐为什么还没有嫁掉。虽然有十万法郎陪嫁，虽然将来还有遗产可得的话常常很巧妙地在嘴上搬弄，依旧没用。邦斯舅舅五年来老听着庭长太太絮絮叨叨地抱怨，她眼看所有的后备员都结了婚，新任的推事已经有了孩子；可是她把玛维尔小姐未来的家私，在毫不动心的、年轻的包比诺子爵前面尽量炫耀，也始终没有结果。这子爵便是药材大王的长子；据龙巴街上那群眼红的人说，当年闹七月革命简直是为的包比诺，至少也得说他所得革命的果实和路易·菲利普平分秋色。

走到旭阿梭街，快要拐进汉诺威街的时候，邦斯就莫名其妙地张皇起来。那种感觉使一个问心无愧的人所受的罪，像最坏的坏蛋看到了宪兵一样。而邦斯的忐忑不安，只是为了不知道庭长太太这一回怎样招待他。老在破坏他心房组织的那颗沙子，并没有给磨钝，棱角倒反越来越尖锐；庭长府上的仆役还要时时刻刻去撩拨那些刺。加缪索他们对邦斯的轻视，邦斯在亲属中间地位的低落，对仆役也有了影响：他们虽不至于对他不敬，却把他看成穷光蛋一流。

他的死冤家是玛维尔太太和玛维尔小姐的贴身女仆，一个干枯瘦削的老姑娘，叫作玛特兰纳·维凡的。玛特兰纳虽是酒糟皮色，也许正为了这个酒糟皮色和蛇一般细长的身材，立志要做邦斯太太。她拿两万法郎的积蓄在老鳏夫前面招摇，可是邦斯对这张酒糟脸表示无福消受。一厢情愿的女仆，存心想做主人的舅母而没有做成，从此跟可怜的音乐家结了仇，想尽方法欺侮他。听到老人走上楼梯，玛特兰纳会老实不客气地叫出来，故意要他听见，“哦！吃白食的又来了！”逢着男当差不在，由她侍候开饭的话，她就在老人的杯中只斟一点儿酒，冲上很多的水[1]，使他不容易把满满的杯子端向嘴边而不泼出来。她假装忘了给老人上菜，让庭长太太提醒她（而那种口气简直教邦斯脸红），再不然就泼些汤汁在他衣服上，总之是下人们阴损一个上级的可怜虫的那套玩意儿，他们知道那样做是决不会挨骂的。

注解：

[1]　法国人饭桌上喝的红酒白酒，临时常冲凉水，多少任意。但好食善饮的人，决不喜欢加水，更不喜欢加大量的水。





八、倒霉的舅舅不受欢迎


又是贴身女仆又是管家，玛特兰纳·维凡从加缪索夫妇结婚的时候就跟了他们。主人初期在内地过的苦日子，她是目睹过的：加缪索先生那时在阿朗松地方法院当推事。一八二八年，加缪索在芒德法院的庭长任上调进京里当预审推事，她又帮着他们在巴黎撑持门户。她和这个家庭的关系既这样密切，自然免不了满肚皮的牢骚。想做庭长先生的舅母，岂非跟骄傲而野心勃勃的庭长太太开玩笑吗？这欲望明明是憋在肚子里的怨气逼出来的；她心中的许多小石子，有朝一日简直能变作一场大冰雹。

“哦，太太，”玛特兰纳进去报告，“你们的邦斯先生又来了，还是穿的那件斯宾塞！我真想问问他，用什么方法保存了二十五年的！”

加缪索太太听见在她卧房与大客厅之间的小客厅中有个男人的脚声，便望着女儿耸耸肩。

“玛特兰纳，你老是通报得这么巧妙，教我措手不及。”

“太太，约翰出去了，只有我在家。邦斯先生打铃，是我去开的门；像他这样的熟客，总不成拦着他不让进来：此刻他正在脱他的斯宾塞呢。”

“我的小猫咪，”庭长太太对女儿说，“这一下可完啦，我们只能在家吃饭了。”然后，看见她心爱的小猫咪哭丧着脸，便补充一句：“你说，要不要把他一劳永逸地打发掉？”

“哦！可怜的人，那他不是少了一处吃饭的地方吗？”加缪索小姐回答。

小客厅里响起几声假咳嗽，表示：“我听见你们说话了呢。”

“好，让他进来吧。”加缪索太太扯了扯肩膀，吩咐玛特兰纳。

“舅公，想不到你来得这么早，”赛西尔·加缪索小姐装着撒娇的神气，“妈妈刚要去穿衣服呢。”

舅公眼梢里看到庭长太太肩头的动作，不由得一阵心酸，把客套话都忘了，只意味深长地回答一句：“你老是这么可爱，小外孙！”

然后转身对她母亲弯了弯腰，又道：

“亲爱的外甥，你不会怪我早来一步吧，你上次要的东西，我特意给捎来了……”

可怜的邦斯每次叫出外甥二字，庭长夫妇和庭长小姐就要觉得头疼。这时他从上衣袋里掏出一只雕刻极工的、小长方的檀香匣子。

“！我早就忘了！”庭长太太冷冷地回答。

这句话的确太狠了！那岂非把这位亲戚的情意看作一文不值吗？固然他没有什么错，但谁教他是个穷亲戚呢？

“可是，”她又道，“你太好了，舅舅。这小玩意儿是不是要我花很多钱呢？”

这一问使舅舅心里打了个寒噤，他本想拿这件古玩来抵消他吃了多少年的饭的。

“我想你可以赏个脸，让我送给你吧。”他的声音有点儿发抖了。

“那怎么行！咱们之间不用客气，都是自己人，谁也不会笑话谁。你又不是那么有钱好随便乱花的。费了时间各处去找，不是已经很够了吗？……”

“亲爱的外甥，这把扇子倘使要你出足价钱，你也不想要的了，”可怜虫有点儿生气地回答，“这是一件华多的精品，两边都是他画的；可是，外甥，你放心，以艺术价值来说，我给的钱连百分之一还不到。”

对一个有钱的人说“你穷！”等于对葛勒拿特的总主教说他的布道毫无价值[1]。凭着丈夫的地位，玛维尔的田庄，出入宫廷舞会的资格，庭长夫人素来自命不凡，听到这样的话，尤其是出自穷音乐家之口，还是一个受她恩惠的人，当然是大不高兴了。

她马上顶了一句：“那么，卖这些玩意儿给你的人都是二百五了？”

“巴黎是没有二百五的生意人的。”邦斯冷冷地回答。

“那一定是靠你的聪明喽。”赛西尔想借此转圜。

“告诉你，小外孙，我的聪明就是在于认得朗克莱、巴丹、华多、格勒兹；可是主要我是想讨你亲爱的妈妈喜欢。”

玛维尔太太又虚荣又无知，不愿意显出她从清客手中收受一点儿礼物，而她的无知又刚好帮了她的忙，因为她连华多的姓名都是初次听到。另一方面，邦斯二十年来第一次有勇气跟外甥媳妇顶嘴，可见收藏家的自尊心强到什么程度，原来那是和作家不相上下的。邦斯也对自己的胆气吃了一惊，便赶紧和颜悦色，拿着那把珍奇的扇子，把扇骨的美妙指给赛西尔看。可是要了解好好先生心惊胆战的原因，必须把庭长太太略为描写一番。

玛维尔太太本是矮身量，淡黄头发，从前又胖又滋润，到四十六岁已经干瘪了，人也更矮了。突出的脑门，凹进去的嘴巴，年轻的时候还有鲜嫩的皮色给点缀一下，现在可使她天生傲慢的神色更像老是生气的模样。在家里霸道惯了，面貌之间有股肃杀之气。年纪大了，淡黄头发变成生辣的栗色。目光炯炯而火气十足的眼睛，显出司法界人士的威严和勉强抑捺着的妒意。的确，在邦斯去吃饭的那批暴发户中间，庭长太太算是穷酸的了。她就不能原谅有钱的药材商，从商务裁判所所长一跃而为议员、部长、伯爵，并且进了贵族院。她也不能原谅她的公公，在包比诺进贵族院的时候，竞选到本区的议员，把大儿子的机会给抡掉了。丈夫在巴黎当了十八年差事，她还没有能看到他升做最高法院的法官，其实这也是他庸碌无能所致。一八四四年，司法部长还在后悔，不该在一八三四年上把加缪索提名为高等法院的庭长；人家派他在控诉部工作：因为早先当过预审推事，他总算能起草判决书什么的，办点儿事。

九、信手拈来的宝物


遭到这些不如意的事，对丈夫的才具又认识得相当清楚，庭长太太的苦闷不知不觉地把精力消磨完了，使她肝火旺得不得了。泼辣的性子，一天天地变本加厉。她年纪没有老，人已经老悖，有心做得冷酷无情，像刷子一般浑身是刺，教人为了害怕不得不对她予取予求。凶悍狠毒，朋友极少，她可是声势浩大，因为有一批跟她性格相仿、彼此回护的老虔婆替她助威。可怜的邦斯见了这个巾帼魔王，素来像小学生见了一个动不动就用戒尺的老师。所以那天庭长太太很奇怪舅舅怎么敢一下子这样大胆，因为她完全不知道礼物的价值。

“这个你在哪儿找来的？”赛西尔仔细瞧着那古董，问。

“在拉北街上的一个古董铺里。你知道，特滦镇附近有所奥南别墅，从前曼那别墅没有盖起的时候，蓬巴杜夫人在那儿住过。最近别墅给拆掉了；其中有最精美的木器，连木雕大家李哀那都保留着两个椭圆框子做模型，认为天下无双的精品……别墅里头好东西多得很。这把扇子，便是我那个古董商在一口嵌木细工的柜子里找到的。我要是收藏木器，一定会买那个柜子；可是甭提啦……一件列斯奈制造的家具，要值三四千法郎！十六、十七、十八世纪，德、法两国嵌木细工的专家做的木器，简直跟图画没有分别：这一点巴黎已经有人知道了。收藏家的长处就在于开风气。你们等着瞧吧，我收藏了二十年的法朗肯塔尔瓷器，再过五年，巴黎的价钱一定要比塞夫勒软坯高过两倍。”

“什么叫作法朗肯塔尔？”赛西尔问。

“那是巴拉提那选侯的官窑；它比我们的塞夫勒窑更早，就像有名的海德尔堡园亭比凡尔赛园亭更古老，因为更古老，所以被我国的丢兰纳将军给毁了[1]。塞夫勒窑好些地方都模仿法朗肯塔尔……说句公道话，德国人在萨克森和巴拉提那两郡，在我们之前早已做出了不起的东西。”

母女俩互相瞪着眼，仿佛邦斯在跟她们讲外国话。巴黎人的无知与偏狭，简直难以想象；他们什么事情都得有人教了才知道，而且还得在他们想学的时候。

“你怎么辨得出法朗肯塔尔的瓷器呢？”

“凭它的标记呀！”邦斯精神抖擞地回答，“那些宝贝都有标记的。法朗肯塔尔的出品有一个C字和T字（巴拉提那选侯Charles Théodore的缩写），交叉在一起，上面还有选侯的冠冕为记。萨克森老窑有两把剑，还有一个描金的数目字。文赛纳窑的图案是个号角。维也纳窑有个圆体的V字，中腰加一画。柏林窑加两画。玛扬斯窑有个车轮。塞夫勒窑有两个L，王后定烧的那一批有个A字，代表Antoinette，上面还画一个王冠。十八世纪各国的君王，都在制造瓷器上面竞争，把人家的好手拉过来。华多替德累斯顿官窑画的餐具，现在价值连城。可是真要你内行，因为德累斯顿近来出了一批抄袭老花样的东西。嘿，当年的出品可是真美，现在再也做不出了……”

“真的？”

“当然真的！现在造不出某些嵌木细工，某些瓷器，正像画不出拉斐尔、提香、伦勃朗、凡·艾克、克拉纳赫！……便是那么聪明那么灵巧的中国人，如今也在仿制康熙窑、乾隆窑……一对大尺寸的真正康熙、乾隆的花瓶，值到六千、七千、一万法郎，现代仿古的只值两百！”

“你这是说笑话吧？”

“外甥，这些价钱你听了出惊，可不算稀奇呢。全套十二客的塞夫勒软坯餐具，还不过是陶器，出厂的价钱就得十万法郎。这样一套东西，一七五〇年已经在塞夫勒卖到十五万。我连发票都看见过。”

“那么这把扇子呢？”赛西尔问，她觉得那古董太旧了。

“你听我说，承你好妈妈瞧得起我，问我要把扇子以后，我就各处去找，跑遍了巴黎所有的铺子，没有能找到好的。为庭长夫人，非弄一件精品不可，我很想替她找玛丽·安多纳德的扇子，那是所有出名的扇子中最美的一把。可是昨天，一看到这件妙物，我简直愣住了，那一定是路易十五定做的。天知道我找扇子怎么会找到拉北街，找到一个卖铜铁器、卖描金家具的奥弗涅人那里去的！我相信艺术品是有灵性的，它们认得识货的鉴赏家，会远远地招呼他们，对他们叫着：喂！喂！来呀！”

庭长太太望着女儿耸耸肩，邦斯却并没发觉这一刹那间的动作。

“这些精打细算的旧货鬼，我全认识。那古董商在没有把收进的货转卖给大商人之前，总愿意让我先瞧一眼的。我便问他：‘喂，莫尼斯特洛，近来收了些什么呀？有没有门楣什么的？’经我这一问，他就告诉我，李哀那怎样地在特滦圣堂替公家雕刻些很了不起的东西，怎样地在奥南别墅拍卖的时候，趁巴黎商人只注意瓷器和镶嵌木器的当口，救出了一部分木雕。——‘我没有弄到什么，可是靠这件东西，大概收回我的旅费是不成问题的了。’他说着给我看那口柜子，真是好东西！布歇画的稿本，给嵌木细工表现得神极了！……叫人看了差点儿要跪在它前面！他又说：‘哎，先生，你瞧这个抽斗，因为没有钥匙，被我撬开了找出这把扇子来！你说，我可以卖给谁呢？……’他拿给我这口檀香木雕的小匣子。‘瞧，这是那种跟后期哥特式相仿的蓬巴杜式。’我回答说：‘哦！匣子倒不坏，我可以要！至于扇子，莫尼斯特洛，我没有什么邦斯太太好送这种老古董；并且现在有的是新出品，非常漂亮，画得挺好，价钱还很便宜。你知道吗，巴黎有两千个画家呢！’说完了，我漫不经心地打开扇子，一点不露出惊叹的表情，只冷冷地瞧了瞧两边的扇面，画得多么轻灵，多么精细！嗬，我拿着蓬巴杜夫人的扇子呢！华多为此一定花过不少心血。我问他：‘柜子要卖多少呢？’——‘哦！一千法郎，已经有人出过这价钱了！’——我对扇子随便给了个价钱，大概等于他的旅费。我们彼此瞪了瞪眼，我看出他是给我拿住了。我赶紧把扇子放进匣子，不让奥弗涅人再去细瞧；我只装作对匣子看得出神，老实说，那也是件古董呢。我对莫尼斯特洛说：‘我买扇子，其实是看中匣子。至于那口柜子，决不止值千把法郎，你瞧瞧那些黄铜镶嵌的镂工吧，够得上做模型……人家拿去大可以利用一下，外边绝对没有相同的式样，当初是专为蓬巴杜夫人一个人设计的……’我那个家伙一心想着柜子，忘了扇子，我又给他指点出列斯奈木器的妙处，他就让我三钱不值两文地把扇子买了来。得啦，就是这么回事。可是要做成这样的买卖，非老经验不可！那是你瞪我一眼，我瞪你一眼，和打仗一样，而犹太人、奥弗涅人的眼睛又是多厉害的哟！”

他提到略施小计把没有知识的古董商骗过了的时候，那种眉飞色舞的表情，老艺术家的兴致，大可给荷兰画家做个模特儿，可是在庭长太太母女前面，一切都白费了，她们冷冷的，鄙夷不屑地彼此眨巴着眼睛，仿佛说：“瞧这个怪物！……”

“你觉得这些事情好玩吗？”庭长夫人问他。

邦斯一听这句话心就凉了，恨不得抓着庭长夫人揍一顿。他回答说：

“哎，好外甥，觅宝就像打猎一样！你追上去吧，劈面又来了敌人要保护那些珍禽异兽！这一下大家都得钩心斗角了！一件精品加上一个诺曼底人，或是犹太人，或是奥弗涅人，不就像童话里的公主由一些妖魔给看守着吗？”

“你又怎么知道那是华——华什么？”

“华多！我的外甥！他是十八世纪法国最大的画家之一。瞧，这不是华多的真迹是什么？”他指着扇面上那幅田园风光的画：缙绅淑女扮着男女牧人在那儿绕着圈子跳舞。“多活泼！多热烈！何等的色彩！何等的功夫！像大书家的签名似的一笔到底！没有一点斧凿的痕迹！再看反面：画的是客厅的跳舞会。一边是冬景一边是夏景，妙不妙？零星的装饰又多么讲究！保存得多好！瞧，扇骨的梢钉是金的，两头各有一颗小红宝石，我把积垢都给刮净了。”

“既然如此，舅舅，这么贵重的一份礼，我就不敢收。你还是留着去大大地赚笔钱吧。”庭长夫人嘴里这么说，心里只想把精美的扇子拿下来。

“宠姬荡妇之物，早该入于大贤大德之手了，”好好先生这时非常镇静，“直要一百年之久，才能实现这个奇迹。我敢担保，现在宫廷里决没有一个公主，能有什么东西比得上这件精品的。可叹古往今来，大家只为蓬巴杜夫人一流的女人卖力，而忘了足为懿范的母后！”

“那么我收下了。”庭长太太笑着说，“赛西尔，我的小天使，你去瞧瞧玛特兰纳，叫她把饭菜弄得好一点，别亏待了舅舅……”

庭长夫人想借此还掉一些情分。可是非常不雅地当着客人吩咐添菜，好比在正账之外另给几文小账，教邦斯面红耳赤，像小姑娘被人拿住了错处一样。这颗石子未免太大了一点，在他心里翻上翻下地滚了好一会。红头发的赛西尔，那种俨然的态度，一方面学着父亲法官式的威严，一方面也有母亲的肃杀之气。这时她走出客厅，让可怜的邦斯自个儿去对付可怕的庭长太太。

十、一个待嫁的女儿


“我的小丽丽真可爱。”庭长太太说。她老是喜欢用从前的乳名称呼赛西尔。

“可爱极了！”老音乐家把大拇指绕来绕去地回答。

“我简直弄不明白这个时代了，”庭长太太接着说，“父亲当着巴黎高等法院的庭长，荣誉团勋三等，祖父又是百万富翁的国会议员，未来的贵族院议员，绸缎批发业中最有钱的大商人，凭了这些都还不中用！”

庭长对新朝代的竭忠尽智最近换到了三等勋章，有些忌妒的人说他是巴结包比诺得来的。上文已经提过，这位部长虽然很谦虚，还是接受了伯爵的封号，据他对好多朋友的说法是“为了儿子”。

“今日之下大家只晓得要钱，”邦斯回答道，“只敬重有钱的人，而且……”

“要是老天把可怜的小查理给我留下来的话，那又怎么得了呢？……”庭长太太叫起来。

“噢！有了两个孩子，你们就难过日子喽！”舅舅接住了她的话。

“平分家产的结果就是这么回事[1]；可是甥少奶，你放心，赛西尔早晚会攀亲的。我哪儿也没见过这么完美的姑娘。”

邦斯在他去吃饭的那些人家就得卑躬屈膝到这个田地：他做他们的应声虫，把人家的话加上些无聊而单调的按语，像古希腊剧中的合唱队。艺术家的特色，在他早年妙语横生的辞令中表现得淋漓尽致的，他再也不敢显露出来；长年韬晦的结果，差不多把那点特色给磨蚀完了，即使偶然流露，也得像刚才那样马上给压下去。

“可是我自己出嫁的时候，只有两万法郎陪嫁……”

“那是一八一九年吧，外甥？”邦斯抢着说，“还亏你精明能干，又有路易十八的提拔！”

“说是这样说，我女儿人又聪明，心地又好，十全十美跟天使一样，有了十万法郎陪嫁，将来还有一大笔遗产，还是没人请教……”玛维尔太太谈谈女儿，谈谈自己，直谈了二十分钟；做母亲的手上有了待嫁的女儿，就有这些特别的唠叨。老音乐家在独一无二的外甥家吃了二十年饭，还没听见人家问过他一声事情混得怎么样，生活怎么样，身体怎么样。并且邦斯好比一个阴沟，到处有人把家长里短的话往他那儿倒；大家对他很放心，知道他不敢不嘴严，因为他要随便溜出一言半语，马上就得尝到多少人家的闭门羹。他除了只听不说之外，还得永远附和别人；什么话都听了笑笑，既不敢替谁分辩，也不敢顺着人怪怨谁：在他看来，谁都没错儿。所以人家不拿他当人看，只当作一个酒囊饭袋！庭长夫人翻来覆去地拉扯了一大套之后，对舅舅表示——当然说话之间也很留神——只要有人给女儿提亲，她差不多想闭着眼睛答应了。甚至一个能有两万法郎进款的男人，哪怕年纪上了四十八，她也觉得是门好亲事了。

“赛西尔今年已经二十三，万一耽搁到二十五六，就极不容易嫁掉了。那时大家都要问，为什么一个姑娘在家里待了这么久。便是眼前吧，亲戚中间七嘴八舌，对这个问题已经议论太多了。我们推托的话早已说尽：什么她还年轻呀，舍不得离开父母呀，在家里挺快活呀，她条件很苛，要挑门第呀等等。老是这一套不给人笑话吗？何况赛西尔也等得不耐烦了，她很痛苦，可怜的小乖乖……”

“为什么痛苦？”邦斯愣头愣脑地问。

“唉，”做母亲的口气很像一个专门替小姐做伴的老婆子，“眼看所有的女朋友一个一个都结了婚，她心里不觉得委屈吗？”

“外甥，从我上次在府上吃过饭以后，有了些什么事，会教你觉得连四十八岁的男人也行呢？”可怜的音乐家怯生生地问。

“事情是这样的：我们早先约好，要到一个法官家里去商量亲事；他有个儿子三十岁，家产很可观，玛维尔预备替他出笔钱运动一个审计官，他原在那儿当着候补。不料人家来通知我们，说那个青年人迷上玛皮伊舞场的红角儿，带着她跑到意大利去了……这明明是推托，骨子里是拒绝。对方母亲已经死了，眼前就有三万一年的进款，将来还有父亲的财产可得，还嫌我们穷呢。刚才我们正为了这件事不痛快，所以你得原谅我们的心绪恶劣。”

邦斯在他见了害怕的主人家里，奉承话老是赶晚一步；那时他正搜索枯肠，想拣些好听的说，玛特兰纳却送进一个字条来，等庭长夫人回话。字条是这样写的：

好妈妈，你不妨把这封信当作爸爸从法院里写来的，叫你带了我上他朋友家吃饭，说我的婚事又有重开谈判的希望，那么舅公一定会走了，而我们就能照原定计划，上包比诺家吃饭去了。

“先生这封信是教谁送来的？”庭长太太急不及待地问。

“法院里的听差。”死板板的玛特兰纳老着脸回答。这句话等于告诉太太：那计策是她跟不耐烦的赛西尔一块儿想出来的。

“好吧，你回报他，说我跟小姐五点半准到。”

十一、食客所受的百般羞辱，这不过是一例


玛特兰纳一出去，庭长太太假装很和善地瞧着邦斯舅舅，那眼神对一个感觉灵敏的人，好比挑精拣肥的舌头碰到了加有酸醋的牛奶。

“亲爱的舅舅，晚饭已经预备了，你自个儿吃吧，我们失陪了；我丈夫送信回来，说又要跟法官商量亲事，教我们上那儿去吃饭……咱们之间一点不用客气，你在这儿尽管自便。我什么都不瞒你的，你瞧我多老实……想必你不会要我们的小天使错过机会吧？”

“我吗？噢，外甥，我真想替她找个丈夫呢；可是在我的环境里……”

“那自然谈不上，”庭长太太很不客气地抢着说，“得啦，那么你不走了？我去穿衣服的时候，赛西尔会来陪你的。”

“噢！外甥，我可以上别的地方吃饭的。”

因为穷而受到庭长太太那种待遇，他固然伤透了心，可是想到要自个儿去应付仆人，他更害怕。

“为什么？……饭菜已经预备好了，还不是得给用人们吃了吗！”听到这句难堪的话，邦斯仿佛触电似的马上站起身子，冷冷地对外甥媳妇行了礼，去穿上他的斯宾塞。赛西尔的卧房是跟小客厅通连的，房门半开着，邦斯从前面的镜子里瞧见她在那儿笑弯了腰，对母亲颠头耸脑地做鬼脸；这一下老艺术家才明白她们是通同闹鬼。他忍着眼泪，慢腾腾地走下楼梯：他眼看自己给这一家撵走了，可不知道为的什么。

“我太老了，”他心里想，“穷跟老是人家最讨厌的。从今以后要不是邀请，我哪儿也不去了。”

多么悲壮的话！……

厨房在屋子的底层，正对门房。像业主自用的那些屋子一样，大门老是关上，厨房门老是开着的。邦斯听见厨娘和当差的在那儿哈哈大笑：玛特兰纳没想到老头儿这么快就跑了，正在把耍弄邦斯的事讲给他们听。当差的很赞成对这个熟客开一下玩笑，说他过年只给一枚三法郎的小洋钱！

厨娘说：“对，可是他真要怄了气，从此不来了，咱们总是少了三法郎的年赏……”

“！他怎么会知道？”当差的回答。

“怕什么！反正早晚是这么回事，”玛特兰纳接着说，“他上哪儿吃饭都招人厌，要不到处给人撵走才怪！”

这时音乐家招呼看门女人：“对不起，开门哪！”一听这声痛苦的叫喊，厨房里的人顿时没有了声音。

“他在那里听着呢。”当差的说。

“再好没有，让他听吧，这个老啬鬼是玩儿完啦。”玛特兰纳回答。

可怜虫把厨房里的话都听了去，连最后那句也没漏掉。他打大街上往回走，神气像个老婆子刚同一个要谋害她的人拼命打过了一架。他一边走一边自言自语，脚步很快，有点哆嗦：受伤的自尊心推着他向前，有如狂风之扫落叶。五点左右他发觉自己到了修院大街，简直不明白是怎么来的；奇怪的是他一点也不觉得饿。

邦斯在这时候回去真是一件出人意料的大事；可是要了解这一点，就得把上文保留的关于西卜太太的情形，在这儿说一说。





十二、男女门房的标本


巴黎颇有些诺曼底街那样的街道，教你一进去就像到了内地：在那儿野草会开花，有个过路人就会引起注意，四邻八舍都彼此认识。房屋全要追溯到亨利四世的朝代，当时特意开辟这个区域，要把每条街题上一个州省的名字，中心造一个规模宏丽的广场题献给国家[1]。以后的欧罗巴区等等，便是这个计划的重演。世界上的一切，连人的思想计划在内，都得到处重演。两位音乐家在一所前有院子后有花园的老屋子内，住着三楼全部；临街的一幢，却是在上一世纪玛莱区最走红的时代盖的[2]。前后两幢都是一个八十老人叫作比勒洛的产业，代管的是他用了二十六年的门房，西卜先生和西卜太太。但因进项不多，使一个在玛莱区当看门的人没法生活，所以西卜除了在房租上拿百分之五的回扣，在每车木柴上抽一定数量的燃料之外，还靠他的手艺挣点儿钱：跟好多门房一样，他是个成衣匠。一来二去，西卜在街坊上有了信用，不再替成衣铺老板做活，而专门给周围三条街上的人缝补，翻新；这些活儿，他在本区里是没人竞争的。门房很宽敞，空气很好，附带还有间卧房，因此西卜夫妇被认为一区的同业中最幸福的一对。

西卜生得单薄，矮小，整天坐着不动的生活，把他的皮肤差不多变成了橄榄色。伏在跟临街那个装有铁栅的窗洞一般高低的工作台上，平均挣二法郎一天。虽然到了五十八岁，他还在做活；可是五十八岁正是看门人的黄金时代，他们待在门房里正是得其所哉，仿佛牡蛎守着它的壳一样；而且到了这个年纪，他们在一区里是妇孺皆知的人物了。

西卜太太从前是个牡蛎美人[3]，凡是牡蛎美人不用追求而自然能遇到的风流艳事，她都经历过来；然后到二十八岁，因为爱上西卜，向蓝钟饭店辞了工。小家碧玉的姿色是保持不久的，尤其是排列成行，坐在菜馆门口做活的女人。炉灶的热气射在她们脸上，使线条变硬；和跑堂的一块儿喝的剩酒，渗进她们的皮肤；因此牡蛎美人的花容玉貌是衰老得最快的。西卜太太还算运气，正式的婚姻和门房的生活，刚好在紧要关头把她的美貌保住了。凭着那种男性美，她很可以做鲁本斯的模特儿[4]，诺曼底街上忌妒她的同业却胡说乱道，叫她大阿福。皮肤闪闪发光，跟整堆的伊西尼牛油一样教人开胃。虽是胖子，她楼上楼下做起活来，那股快当劲儿却是谁也不能比。她已经到了那一流的女人需要剃胡子的年纪。这不是说她四十八了吗？看门女人的胡子，对业主是整齐与安全的保障。倘若特拉克洛阿瞧见西卜太太大模大样地扶着她的长扫帚，准会把她画做一个罗马时代的女战神的。

古怪的是，西卜夫妇（照法院公诉书的口吻，应当说男人西卜，妻某氏）的地位，竟会有一天影响到两位朋友的生活！所以写历史的人不得不把门房的内情叙述得详细一点，以求忠实。临街的屋子一共有三个公寓，院子和花园之间的老屋也有三个公寓，全部房租共计八千法郎左右。此外有个卖旧铜铁器的商人叫作雷蒙诺克的，占着一个靠街的铺面。这雷蒙诺克近几月来改做了古董生意，很知道邦斯藏品的价值，看见音乐家进进出出，总得在铺子里向他打个招呼。所以西卜夫妇除了住房跟柴火不花钱之外，房租上的回扣大概有四百法郎；西卜做活的收入每年统扯有七八百；加上年赏什么的，进款的总数约有一千六，都不折不扣地给夫妻俩吃掉了。他们日子过得比一般的平民都好，西卜女人老说：“人生一世，只此一遭！”由此可见她这个大革命时期出生的人，干脆不知道什么叫作《教理问答》。

眼睛橘黄色而目光傲慢的看门女人，凭着蓝钟饭店的经历，懂得点儿烹调，使她丈夫受到所有的同业羡慕。因此，到了中年而快要踏进老年的时候，西卜夫妇连一百法郎的积蓄都没有。穿得好，吃得好，他们还靠着二十六年的清白在街坊上受人尊重。他们固然家无恒产，可也没有（用他们的说法）拿过人家唔个小钱；因为西卜太太讲话特别多用N音，她对丈夫说：“你唔是个唔宝贝！”这种怪腔怪调，是跟她的不理会宗教一样的无理可说。两口儿对于这种毫无亏心事的生活，六七条街上的人的敬重，业主让他们管理屋子的大权，非常得意；可是有了这些而不能同时也有储蓄，不免使他们暗中发急。西卜常常抱怨手脚酸痛，而西卜太太也嘀嘀咕咕的，说她可怜的西卜到这个年纪还得做活。早晚会有那么一天，一个看门的过了三十年这种生活之后，要怨政府不公平，没有给他荣誉团勋章！只要有人在闲话中间提到某个老妈子只干了近十年，东家便在遗嘱上给了她三四百法郎终身年金，马上会一传十，十传百，到处在门房里引起许多唠叨，证明巴黎那些干下等行业的存着多少忌妒的心：

“唉！咱们哪，就轮不到在遗嘱上有个名字！咱们没有这福气！可是哼，那些仆人能跟我们比吗？我们是人家的心腹，经手房租，替他们看着这个，守着那个；可是人家只拿我们当狗看待，不多不少，就跟狗一样，你瞧！”

“一切都是运道！”西卜从外边拿着件衣服回来，说。

西卜太太双手叉在粗大的腰里和邻居聊天的时候，直着嗓子叫道：“要是我把西卜丢在门房里，自个儿去当厨娘，现在也能有三万法郎存起来了。我不会做人，只晓得守着舒服的屋子，暖暖和和的，既不省穿又不省吃的。”

十三、大为惊奇


一八三六年，两个朋友一搬进老屋子的三楼，西卜家的生活就大起变化。事情是这样的。许模克和邦斯一样，住到哪儿都是教门房——不管是男的还是女的——招呼家里的杂务。来到诺曼底街，两位音乐家就决定请西卜太太打杂，每月给她二十五法郎，两人各出十二法郎五十生丁。刚满一年，老资格的看门女人在两个男人家里就能支配一切，等于她支配包比诺伯爵夫人的舅公比勒洛的屋子。她把他们的事当作自己的事，口口声声总是“我的两位先生”。并且，她看到一对榛子钳像绵羊一般的柔和，生活挺马虎，绝对不猜疑人，简直是孩子，她便凭着那种下等阶级妇女的心肠保护他们，疼他们，伺候他们，忠心耿耿，甚至有时会埋怨他们几句，不让他们在日常生活上吃亏——许多巴黎家庭便是这样增加开支的。两个单身汉花了二十五法郎，无意中竟得了个母亲。发觉西卜太太那些好处之后，他们很天真地向她道谢，说些好话，逢时过节送些小礼，使彼此的关系愈加密切了。西卜太太认为受人赏识比得人钱财更快乐，知遇之感能增加工钱的价值也是人之常情。西卜替两位先生当差的时候，不论是补衣服，是跑腿，或是别的什么，都只收半费。

从第二年起，三楼房客和门房的交情又深了一层。许模克跟西卜太太做成一桩交易，使他疏懒的脾气和百事不想管的愿望，完全得到满足。以每天一法郎半，每月四十五法郎的代价，西卜太太包下了许模克的中饭跟晚饭。邦斯觉得朋友的中饭怪不错，便出十八法郎也包了一顿。这种供应伙食的办法，在门房的收入项下每月增加了九十法郎左右，把两个房客变成了不可侵犯的人物，简直是天神，天使，上帝。咱们的王上据说是很精明的，但宫中对他的侍候能不能像人家对两个榛子钳那么周到，倒很难说了。他们喝的牛奶是直接从桶子里倒出来的原货；报纸是白看二楼或四楼的，那些房客起得晚，必要时可以推说报纸还没送到。他们的屋子、衣服、楼梯间，一切都由西卜太太收拾得像佛兰德人家一样干净[1]。许模克从来没想到能这样的快乐；西卜太太把他的生活安排得十分简便；花上六法郎，洗衣服和缝补也归西卜太太包办了。伙食账跟洗衣费之外，另外买十五法郎的烟丝；每月这三项开销共计六十六法郎，一年七百九十二法郎。再加二百二十法郎的房租和捐税，一共是一千零十二法郎。西卜负责许模克的衣着，约需一百五十法郎。这位潇然意远的哲人，一年花上一千二百法郎便对付过去了。在玛莱区诺曼底街，靠西卜太太帮忙，一个人有一千二年金就能快快活活地过日子：那些一心想住到巴黎来的欧洲人听了，不是要喜出望外吗？

那天，看到邦斯在傍晚五点左右回家，西卜太太简直发呆了。不但这是从来未有的事，而且她的先生连看都没有看见她，更不必说招呼她了。

“喂！西卜，”她对丈夫说，“我看邦斯先生不是发了财，便是发了疯！”

“大概是吧。”西卜回答的时候把一只衣袖掉了下来，照裁缝的俗语说，他正在给那只袖子加衬头。

十四、两只鸽子的寓言成了事实[1]


邦斯木偶似的回家，西卜太太刚巧端整好许模克的晚饭。饭菜是整个院子都闻到味儿的一盘所谓红焖牛肉。向一家熟货店买来的零头零尾的白煮牛肉，跟切成小薄片的洋葱放在牛油里尽煎，煎到肉和洋葱把油都吸干了，使看门女人的大菜看上去像炸鱼。西卜太太预备给丈夫和许模克平分的这个菜，加上一瓶啤酒一块乳酪，就能教德国老音乐家心满意足。你们可以相信，便是全盛时期的所罗门王也没有比许模克吃得更好。今天是把白煮牛肉加上洋葱煨一煨，明天是把残余的仔鸡红烧一下，后天是什么冷牛肉和鱼，浇上西卜女人自己发明的一种沙司，连做母亲的也会糊里糊涂给孩子吃的沙司[2]，过一天又是什么野味，都得看大街上的菜馆卖给小熟货店的是哪一类东西，有多少数量。这便是许模克的日常菜单；他对于好西卜太太端上来的东西从来没有一句话，总是满意的。而好西卜太太把这个菜单逐渐克减，结果只要一法郎就能对付。

“可怜的好人有什么事，我马上就能知道，”西卜太太对丈夫说，“瞧，许模克先生的夜饭预备好啦。”

西卜太太在陶器菜盘上盖了一只粗瓷碟子，虽然上了年纪，还能在许模克给邦斯开门的时候赶到。

“你怎么啦，好朋友？”德国人看见邦斯面无人色，不由得吓了一跳。

“等会告诉你；现在我来跟你一块儿吃夜饭……”

“怎么！和我一块儿吃？”许模克高兴得叫起来，但又想起了朋友讲究吃喝的脾气，“那怎么行呢？”这时，德国老头发觉西卜太太以管家的资格有名有分地在那儿听着。凭着一个真正的朋友所能有的灵感，他直奔女门房，把她拉到楼梯间：

“西卜太太，邦斯这好人是喜欢吃的；你上蓝钟饭店去叫点儿讲究的菜：什么鳃鱼呀，面条呀！总之要像罗古罗斯吃的一样[3]！”

“什么罗古罗斯？”西卜太太问。

“得啦，你去要一个清烧小牛肉，一条新鲜的鱼，一瓶波尔多，不管什么，只要挑最好的菜就行了：譬如糯米肉饼、熏腊肉等等！你先把账给付了，一句话都别说，明儿我还你钱就是了。”

许模克搓着手，喜滋滋地回进屋子；可是听到朋友一刹那间遇到的伤心事，他脸上慢慢地又恢复了发呆的表情。他尽量安慰邦斯，搬出他那一套对社会的看法：巴黎的生活有如一场无休无歇的暴风雨，男男女女仿佛都给疯狂的华尔兹舞卷了去；我们不应该有求于人，他们都只看表面，“不看内心的。”他说。他又提到讲了上百次的老故事，说有三个女学生，是他生平最喜欢而为之不惜任何牺牲的；她们也对他挺好，还每年各出三百法郎，凑成九百法郎的津贴送他；可是她们哪，这些年来一次也没来看过他，都身不由己地给巴黎生活的狂潮冲走了，甚至最近三年他上门去也没能见到她们。（事实上许模克的拜访那般阔太太，都是上午十点钟去的！）至于津贴，那是由公证人分季支给他的。

“可是她们心真好。对于我，她们简直就是保护音乐的女神。包当杜哀太太，王特奈斯太太，杜·蒂哀太太，个个都是怪可爱的。我看见她们的时候总是在天野大道，她们可看不见我……她们对我多好，我尽可上她们家吃饭，她们一定很欢迎；我也可以上她们的别墅去住，可是我宁愿和我的邦斯在一起，因为我随时可以看到他，天天看到他。”

邦斯抓起许模克的手紧紧握着，等于把心里的话都表白了。两人相对无语，过了好几分钟，像一对久别重逢的情人似的。

“还是每天在家吃饭吧，”许模克这么说着，暗中反而在感谢庭长太太的狠心，“哎！咱们一块儿去玩古董，那么魔鬼也不会上咱们家来捣乱了。”

要懂得“咱们一块儿去玩古董”这句悲壮的话，先得知道许模克对古董一窍不通。他为了爱友心切，才不至于在让给邦斯做美术馆用的客厅和书房里打烂东西。许模克全神贯注在音乐里头，一心一意在那儿替自己作曲，他瞧着朋友的小玩意儿，好似一条鱼被请到卢森堡公园去看莳花展览。他对那些神妙的作品很尊敬，因为邦斯捧着他的宝物掸灰的时候很尊敬。朋友在那里低回赞叹，他就在旁凑上一句：“是呀，多好看！”好似母亲看到一个还不会说话的孩子对她做手势，就拿些没有意义的话做回答。自从两位朋友同住之后，许模克眼看邦斯把时钟换了七次，总是越换越好。换到最后，是布勒雕得最精美的一座，紫檀木上镶着黄铜，有好几个雕刻做装饰，属于布勒第一期的作风[4]。布勒的作风有两期，正如拉斐尔的有三期。第一期，他把黄铜与紫檀融合得恰到好处；第二期，他违反自己的主张，改镶螺钿，为了要打倒发明贝壳嵌花的同业，他在这方面有惊人的表现。邦斯尽量引经据典地解释给许模克听，他始终看不出精美的布勒座钟和其他的多少钟有什么分别。但既然那些古董与邦斯的快乐有关，他就格外地爱护，连邦斯自己也不及他那样无微不至。所以听到许模克“咱们一块儿去玩古董”的话，难怪邦斯的气都平下去了，因为德国人那句话的意思是：“倘使你在家吃饭，我可以拿出钱来陪你玩古董。”

“请两位先生用饭吧。”西卜太太装着俨然的神气进来说。

我们不难想象邦斯瞧着尝着这一顿靠许模克的友情张罗得来的晚饭，是怎样的惊喜交集。这一类的感觉一生中是难得有的，彼此老说着“你就是我，我就是你”那样的深情就没有这感觉，因为时时刻刻的关切使受到的人变得麻木了；直要莫逆之交的真情洋溢，与世态炎凉的残酷有了比较，一个人才会恍然大悟。两颗伟大的心灵，一朝由感情或友情结合之后，全靠外界的刺激把他们的交谊不断地加强。因此邦斯抹掉了两滴眼泪，而许模克也不能不抹着他湿透的眼睛。他们一句话不说，可是更相爱了，他们只点首示意，而安神止痛的表情，使邦斯忘了庭长太太丢在他心中的小石子。许模克拼命搓着手，几乎把表皮都擦破，因为他心血来潮，忽然有了个主意。德国人平时对诸侯们服从惯了，头脑久已迟钝，这一回许模克念头转得这么快，可以说是了不得的奇事。

“我的好邦斯？”许模克开始说。

“我猜着了，你要我每天跟你一块儿吃晚饭……”

“我恨不得有钱，让你天天过这样的生活……”好心的德国人不胜怅惘地回答。西卜太太，因为不时从邦斯手中得到些戏票，素来把他和包饭客人许模克同等看待的，这时提出了下面那样的计划：

“嗨，嗨，不供给酒，只要三法郎，我就能每天做一顿夜饭，包你们把盘子舔得精光，像洗过了似的。”

“对，”许模克接口道，“西卜太太给我做的菜，我吃得比那些吃王家焖肉的人还要好……”

循礼守法的德国人，为了急于要把邦斯留在家里，居然学着小报上的轻薄，对王上吃的定价菜也毁谤起来了。

“真的吗？”邦斯说，“那么我明天试一试！”

一听见朋友许了这个愿，许模克便从桌子这一头扑到那一头，把台布、盘子、水瓶一齐拖着走，他拼命搂着邦斯的劲儿，好像一条火舌蹿向另一条火舌。

“哎啊，我多快活！”他叫着。

西卜太太也受了感动，很得意地说：“好哇，先生天天在这儿吃饭了！”

她的美梦实现了，可是她并不知道促成美梦的内幕。她奔下楼去，走进门房，好似玉才华在《威廉·退尔》中出场时的神气[5]；她把盘子碟子往旁边一扔，叫道：

“西卜，赶快上土耳其咖啡馆要两小杯咖啡，关照炉子上说是我要的！”

然后她坐下来，双手按着肥大的膝盖，从窗里望着对面的墙，自言自语地说：

“今晚上我得找封丹太太去起个课！……”

封丹太太是替玛莱区所有的厨娘、女仆、男当差、看门的……起课卜卦的。

十五、一心想在遗嘱上有个名字


“这两位先生搬来之后，咱们在储蓄银行已经有了二千法郎。不过八年工夫，总算是运气喽！包了邦斯先生的饭，是不是要赚他的钱，把他留在家里呢？封丹太太一定会告诉我的。”西卜太太这样想着。

看到邦斯和许模克都没有继承人，西卜太太三年来认为两位先生将来的遗嘱上必定有她的名字。她存了这种非分之想，做事格外巴结。一向是个老实人，她的贪心直到她长了胡子才抬头的。依着女门房的心思，两位先生最好完全由她操纵；可是邦斯天天在外边吃晚饭，并没有完全落在她手里。西卜太太原有一些勾引挑逗的念头在脑海中蠢蠢欲动，看着老收藏家的游牧生活只觉得无计可施；但从那餐值得纪念的夜饭之后，她的念头就一变而为惊人的大计划。过了一刻钟，西卜太太又在饭厅里出现了，手里托着两杯芳冽的咖啡和两小杯樱桃酒。

“好一个西卜太太！”许模克叫起来，“她把我的心思猜着了。”

吃白食的朋友又絮絮叨叨地怨叹了一阵，许模克又想出话来哄了他一阵，家居的鸽子要安慰出门的鸽子是不愁没有话说的[1]。然后两人一同出门了。在邦斯受了加缪索家主仆那场气之后，许模克觉得非陪着朋友不可。他懂得邦斯的脾气，知道他坐在乐队里那张指挥椅上，又会给一些忧郁的思潮抓住，把倦鸟归巢的效果给破坏了的。半夜里许模克搀着邦斯的胳膊回家，像一个人对待心爱的情妇似的，一路上告诉邦斯哪儿是阶沿，哪儿是缺口，哪儿是阴沟；他恨不得街面是棉花做的，但愿天色清明，有群天使唱歌给邦斯听。这颗心中他从来抓握不到的最后一角，现在也给他征服了！

三个月光景，邦斯每天和许模克一起吃晚饭。第一，他先得把玩古董的钱克减八十法郎一月，因为在四十五法郎的饭钱之外，还得花三十五法郎买酒。第二，不论许模克多么体贴，不论他搬出多少德国式的笑话，老艺术家依然想着他早先吃饭的人家那些好菜，好咖啡，饭后酒，饭桌上的废话，虚伪的礼貌，同席的客人，东家长西家短的胡扯。一个人到了日薄西山的时候，要打破三十六年的习惯是办不到的。一百三十法郎一桶的酒，斟在一个老饕的杯子里是淡薄得很的；所以邦斯每次举起杯子，总得想到别人家中的美酒而千舍不得，万舍不得。三个月末了，邦斯那颗敏感的心几乎为之破裂的痛苦，已经淡忘了，他只想着应酬场中的快意事儿，正如为女人着迷的老头儿痛惜一个几次三番不忠实的情妇。老音乐家虽然把刻骨铭心的苦闷尽量遮掩着，可是显而易见害着一种说不出的，从精神方面来的病。

要说明这个因破坏习惯而得来的相思病，只消把数不清的小事举一个例子就行，因为那些小事像铁甲衫上的钢丝一般紧裹着一个人的心。邦斯从前最大的快感，也就是吃白食的最高的享受，有一项是新鲜的刺激。女主人们为了要把饭局点缀得像酒席一样，往往很得意地添一盘精美的菜，教人吃得格外津津有味。邦斯就在念念不忘这种胃的享受。西卜太太有心卖弄，把饭菜预先报给他听，使邦斯的生活完全没有了周期的刺激。他的夜饭谈不上新鲜的感觉，再没有我们祖母时代所谓盖着碟子端出来的菜！这就不是许模克所能了解的了。而邦斯为了面子攸关，也不敢说出他的苦处。可是世界上要有什么比怀才不遇更可悲的事，那就是无人了解的肚子了。一般人夸张失恋的悲剧，其实心灵的需要爱情并非真正的需要：因为没有人爱我们，我们可以爱上帝，他是不吝施舍的。至于口腹的苦闷，那又有什么痛苦可以相比？人不是第一要生活吗？邦斯不胜遗憾地想念某些鸡蛋乳脂，那简直是美丽的诗歌！某些白沙司，简直是杰作！某些鲜菌烧野味，简直是心肝宝贝！而更了不起的是唯独在巴黎才吃得到的有名的莱茵鲤鱼，加的又是多精致的作料！有些日子，邦斯想到包比诺伯爵府上的厨娘，不由得叫一声：“噢！莎菲！”过路人听了以为这好人在想他的情妇，哪知他想的东西比情妇还名贵得多，原来是一盘肥美的鲤鱼！沙司缸里盛着鲜明的沙司，舔在舌头上浓酽酽的，真有资格得蒙底翁奖金！过去那些名菜的回忆，使乐队指挥消瘦了很多，他害上了口腹的相思病。

十六、德国人中的一个典型


第四个月初，一八四五年正月将尽的时候，戏院里的同事注意到邦斯的健康了。其中有个吹笛子的青年，像差不多所有的德国人一样名叫威廉，幸而他姓希华勃，才不至于和所有的威廉相混，但仍没法和所有的希华勃分清。他觉得必须把邦斯的情形点醒许模克。那天正上演新戏，用得着许模克所担任的乐器。

邦斯愁眉苦脸跨上指挥台的时候，威廉·希华勃便指着他说：“老人家精神不行呢，怕有什么病吧。你瞧，他目光黯淡，挥起棍子也不大得劲。”

“人到了六十岁总是这样的。”许模克回答。

他为了每天和朋友一同吃饭的乐趣，简直会把朋友都牺牲掉；这情形很像沃尔特·司各特所写的那个母亲，为了把儿子多留二十四小时，结果送了他的命[1]。

“戏院里大家都在为他操心，正像头牌舞女哀络依思·勃里斯多小姐说的，他连擤鼻子的声音都没有了。”希华勃又说。

往常老音乐家捧着手帕擤起他窟窿很大的长鼻子来，声音像吹喇叭，为此常常受到庭长夫人的埋怨。

“只要能让他有点儿消遣，要我怎样牺牲都愿意；他心里闷得慌。”许模克回答。

“真的，我老是觉得邦斯先生了不起，咱们这批穷小子高攀不上，所以我不敢请他吃喜酒。我要结婚了……”

“怎么样的结婚？”许模克问。

“噢！当然是规规矩矩的。”威廉听到许模克问得这么古怪，以为是句俏皮话，其实这个纯粹的基督徒是根本不会挖苦人的。

听见台上的铃响了，邦斯把乐队里的人马瞧了一眼，叫道：“喂，大家坐下吧！”

乐队奏着《魔鬼的未婚妻》的序曲；那是一出非常叫座的神幻剧，直演了二百场。第一次休息时间，乐队里人都走尽了，只剩下威廉和许模克，场子里的温度在列氏寒暑表上升到三十六度。

“来，把你的故事讲给我听。”许模克对威廉说。

“那个月楼上的年轻人，你瞧见没有？……你认得是谁吗？”

“不认得……”

“那是因为他戴了黄手套，发了财的缘故；他就是我的朋友弗列兹·勃罗纳，那个美因河上的法兰克福人……”

“是以前到乐队里来，坐在你旁边看戏的那个吗？”

“就是他。可不是变了一个人，教你不相信吗？”

这故事的主角是代表某一种典型的德国人。他的相貌，一方面有歌德的曼非斯托番那种尖刻辛辣的气息[2]，一方面像奥古斯德·拉封丹的小说中的人物，爱说爱笑，脾气挺好；他又刁猾又天真；有生意人的贪狠，也有跑马总会会员的洒脱；而最主要的还有使少年维特想自杀的那种苦闷，但他的苦闷不是为了什么夏洛蒂[3]，而是为了德国的诸侯。他的脸十足地道是个德国典型：又狡狯，又朴实，又愚蠢，又勇敢，他所有的那点知识只能增加烦恼，所有的经验给他闹一下孩子气就完了；他滥喝啤酒，滥抽烟；再加美丽而无神的蓝眼睛闪出一点可怕的光芒，使身上的那些对比格外显著。弗列兹·勃罗纳穿扮得像银行家一样讲究，在戏院里耸着一个秃顶的脑袋，皮色像提香画上的，早年的放浪生活与以后的落难生活，还给他在脑壳两旁留下少许金黄头发蜷作一堆，使他恢复家业的那天还有资格去照顾理发匠。他的脸从前长得又俊又嫩，像画家笔下的耶稣基督，如今颜色变得很难看，长了红红的髭和茶褐色的胡子，愈加阴沉了。跟忧患挣扎的结果相比，眼睛也蓝得不明净了。落魄巴黎的时期所受的种种委屈，使他的眼皮瘪了下去，眼睛的轮廓也改了样；可是当初母亲还认为这对眼睛就是自己的小影而看得出神呢。这个少年老成、未老先衰的小伙子，原是个后母一手造成的。

以下我们要讲一个浪子的故事，在虽是中立而不失为开明的、美因河上的法兰克福城里，那简直是破天荒的怪事[4]。

十七、生在法兰克福的浪子会一变而为百万富翁的银行家[1]


弗列兹的父亲叫作奚台翁·勃罗纳，是法兰克福许多有名的旅馆主人之一；他们都跟银行家上下其手，在法律许可的范围内盘剥旅客。除此以外，他是个挺规矩的加尔文教徒，娶了一位改宗的犹太姑娘，带过来的陪嫁便是他起家的资本。犹太女人故世的时候，弗列兹只有十二岁，由父亲和舅舅共同监护。舅舅是来比锡的一个皮货商，维拉士公司的主人；他的性情可不像皮货那么柔和，他要老勃罗纳把小弗列兹的遗产存入阿尔—萨却尔特银行，不得动用。给舅子这个犹太办法一气之下，老头儿续弦了，说没有主妇的监督与帮忙，他对付不了旅馆。他娶了另一个旅馆主人的女儿，没结婚的时候认为她简直十全十美，可是他对于给父母宠惯的独养女儿完全没有经验。第二位勃罗纳太太的行为脾气，就跟那些泼悍而轻狂的德国少女一模一样。她把自己的钱尽量挥霍，又为了跟故世的勃罗纳太太斗气，使丈夫在家里成为法兰克福从来未有的最痛苦的人，据说一般百万富翁知道了竟想要市政当局订一条法律，勒令所有的妻子只许爱丈夫一人。那女的喜欢所有的酸酒（德国人一律叫作莱茵佳酿），喜欢巴黎的商品，喜欢骑马，喜欢装扮；总之只要是花钱的，她都爱，就是不爱女人。她和小弗列兹结了仇；这个加尔文教与犹太教的结晶品，要不是生在法兰克福而有莱比锡的维拉士公司做监护，简直会给她气得发疯。可是维拉士舅舅一心忙着他的皮货，除了照顾存在银行里的遗产以外，让孩子由后母摆布。

雌老虎般的后母，因为费了火车机头那么大的劲也生不出一个孩子来，所以特别恨第一位美丽的勃罗纳太太生的小天使。该死的女人存着恶毒的心，鼓励年轻的弗列兹在二十一岁上就一反德国人的习惯，挥金如土。她希望英国的名马，莱茵的酸酒，歌德的玛葛丽德[2]，把犹太女人的儿子和他的家私一齐毁掉；因为维拉士舅舅在外甥成年的时候给了他一笔很大的遗产。名胜区域的赌场，包括威廉·希华勃在内的酒肉朋友，固然把维拉士舅舅给的钱花光了；可是上帝还有心要这青年浪子给法兰克福的小兄弟们一个教训：所有的家庭都拿他做坏榜样，吓得孩子们只能乖乖地守着装满马克的铁账柜。弗列兹·勃罗纳并没夭折，还有福气把后母送进公墓，那是德国人因为酷爱园艺，借了尊重死者的名目而收拾得特别美丽的。所以第二位勃罗纳太太是死在丈夫之前，而老勃罗纳只得损失了她在银箱里搜刮得去的钱，白吃了好些苦，把大力士一般的体格，在六十岁上就磨得像吃了博吉亚的毒药一样[3]。为后妻受了十年罪而还得不到一点儿遗产，这旅馆主人便成了一座海德堡的废墟；幸而还有旅客的账单不断给他修补一下，正如海德堡废墟也老是有人修葺，使大批参观古迹的游客不至于扫兴。

法兰克福人提到他，仿佛提到什么破产的新闻；大家在背后指手画脚地说：“你瞧，娶个没有遗产的泼妇，再加一个用法国办法教养大的儿子，结果就是这样！”

在意大利和德国，法国人是一切灾祸的根源，一切枪弹的靶子。可是像诗人勒法郎·特·蓬比涅昂说的：“无名小子尽管出口伤人，上帝的神光早晚能照出事情的真相。”

荷兰大旅馆的主人不但在账单上泄愤，使旅客受到影响，还认为儿子是他间接的祸水。所以当小勃罗纳把产业败光之后，老勃罗纳就什么都不管了：面包，清水，盐，火，屋子，烟草，概不供给；在一个开旅馆的德国老子，这的确是恩断义绝的表示。而地方当局，既不考虑做父亲的错误在先，只觉得他是法兰克福最不幸的人，便有心帮助他一下，无端端地跟弗列兹寻事，把他赶出自由市。法兰克福虽是日耳曼帝国会议集会的地方，司法也不比别处更公平合理。世界上难得有什么法官会追溯罪恶与灾祸的根源，去弄清楚第一次把水泼出来的时候是谁挑的水桶。既然勃罗纳把儿子忘了，儿子的朋友们当然群起效尤。

那晚戏院里的新闻记者、漂亮朋友、巴黎妇女，都在奇怪哪儿来的这个神色悲壮的德国人，混在巴黎的时髦场中，孤零零地坐在月楼上看第一次上演的新戏。唉！倘若上面的故事能在这戏院演出的话，它比当晚演的《魔鬼的未婚妻》不知要有趣多少倍，虽然女人受魔鬼诱惑的故事有史以来已经连续演到几十万次[4]。

弗列兹步行到斯特拉斯堡，在那儿的遭遇可比圣经上的那个浪子幸运多了。这一点证明阿尔萨斯是了不起的，它有多少慷慨豪侠的心，让那些德国人看看，法兰西民族的秀气与日耳曼民族的笃实，合在一起是多么完美[5]。威廉·希华勃才得了父母十万法郎遗产。他对弗列兹张开臂抱，掏出心来，接他在家里住，拿钱给他花。弗列兹浑身灰土，潦倒不堪，差不多像害了麻风病，一朝在莱茵彼岸，从一个真心朋友手中拿到一枚二十法郎的钱的那种心境，直要咏为诗歌才能描写，而且只有古希腊的大诗人邦达才有那种笔力，能使普天下的人闻风兴起，重振那行将澌灭的友情。弗列兹与威廉两人的名字，和达蒙与比底阿斯，加斯多与包吕克斯，奥莱斯德与比拉特，杜勃滦伊与梅耶[6]，许模克与邦斯，或是你给拉·封丹寓言中那样的朋友起的任何名字（以拉·封丹的天才，也只写了两个抽象的典型而没有给他们一个血肉之体），可以并列而无愧，因为像威廉当初帮着弗列兹把家产荡尽一样，此刻弗列兹也帮着威廉抽着各种各式的烟草，把遗产吃光。

奇怪的是，两个朋友的家私是在斯特拉斯堡的酒店里，跟跑龙套的女戏子和声名狼藉的阿尔萨斯姑娘糊里糊涂送掉的。

两人每天早上都说：“咱们怎样也该歇手了吧，拿着剩下的一点钱，该打个主意，干点儿正经才好！”

“，今儿再玩一天吧，”弗列兹说，“明天……噢！明天一定……”

在败家子的生活中，今天总是一个头等吹大炮的角色，明天总是一个头等胆怯鬼，听了昨天的大话害怕的；今天好比古时戏剧中的牛大王，明天赛似现代哑剧中的小丑。用到最后一张一千法郎的钞票时，两个朋友搭上王家驿车到了巴黎，投奔一个在奚台翁·勃罗纳手下当过领班侍者，此刻在玛伊街开莱茵旅馆的葛拉夫。他们当下就住在旅馆的阁楼上。葛拉夫把弗列兹荐入格雷兄弟银行当职员，拿六百法郎一年薪水；又把威廉荐到他的兄弟，有名的葛拉夫裁缝那里去当会计。葛拉夫替一对浪子谋这两个小差事，表示他并没忘了自己是荷兰大旅馆出身。有钱朋友招留落难朋友，一个开旅馆的德国人救济两个囊无分文的同乡，这两件事也许教有些人疑心这段历史是虚构的；尤其因为近来的小说一意模仿事实，所以事实倒反更像小说了。

弗列兹当着六百法郎的职员，威廉当着六百法郎的会计，发觉在一个像巴黎那么需要花钱的城里过日子是不容易的。所以他们来到巴黎的第二年，在一八三七年上，威廉靠着会吹笛子，进了邦斯的乐队，多挣几个钱开开荤。至于弗列兹，只能凭外婆家维拉士传给他的做买卖的本领去捞些油水。可是虽然拼命地干，法兰克福人直到一八四三年才挣上二千法郎一年，而这还全靠他有弄钱的本领。贫穷这位圣明的后母，把两个青年管教好了，那是他们的母亲没有能做到的；她教他们懂得节省，懂得人生，懂得世故；她以苦其心志劳其筋骨的方式给大人物（他们的童年都是艰难困苦的）受的那一套严厉的教育，也给他们受过了。可惜弗列兹与威廉都是庸庸碌碌的人，不肯全部接受贫穷的教训，只想躲避她的打击，挣脱她的拥抱，吃不消她瘦骨嶙峋的胳膊；他们不能像天才一样逆来顺受，从困苦中去打天下。可是他们总算明白了金钱的可贵，打定主意，倘使再有财神上门，一定要割掉他翅膀不让他飞走了。

十八、发财的经过


威廉用德文把这个故事详详细细讲给钢琴家听了，接着又说：

“嗳，许模克老头，再来两句，事情就全明白了。勃罗纳的父亲死了。勃罗纳和我们的房东葛拉夫，都不知道老头儿是巴登铁道的一个创办人，赚了很多钱，留下四百万！今晚我在这儿是最后一次吹笛子了。要不是因为这是第一场的新戏，我早跑啦，可是我不愿意我那部分音乐给弄糟了。”

“这才对啦，小伙子，”许模克说，“可是你娶的是哪一位呢？”

“就是咱们的房东、莱茵旅馆主人葛拉夫先生的女儿。我爱哀弥丽小姐已经爱了七年，她念的爱情小说太多了，竟然把所有的亲事都回掉，一片痴心等着我。这小姐是黎塞留街上葛拉夫裁缝唯一的继承人，将来家私很大。弗列兹把咱们一同在斯特拉斯堡吃掉的钱还了我五倍，五十万法郎！……他组织一个银行，投资一百万；我加进五十万，葛拉夫裁缝也来五十万；我的岳父答应我把二十五万陪嫁也放进去，他自己再加二十五万股子。这样，勃罗纳—希华勃公司就有二百五十万资本。最近弗列兹买进一百五十万法兰西银行股票，作为我们银行往来的保证金。他的家产不止这些，还有他父亲在法兰克福的老店，估计值到一百万，已经租给葛拉夫的一个堂兄弟去经营了。”

“你瞧着你朋友的神气不大高兴，是不是忌妒他呢？”许模克问，他把威廉的话听得很仔细。

“我是为了弗列兹的幸福着急，”威廉说，“瞧他那个表情，可是个知足的人吗？想到巴黎我就替他害怕，只希望他学我的样。他老毛病可能再犯的。咱们两人中间，他意志并不比我强。这副打扮，这个手眼镜，都叫我担心。他眼睛只看着池子里那些骚女人。唉！你不知道要弗列兹结婚才不容易呢！他最讨厌法国人所谓的追求；我们只能硬逼他成家，像英国人硬逼一个人进天堂一样[1]。”

在新戏完场例有的喧闹声中，笛师当面邀请乐队指挥去吃喜酒。邦斯挺高兴地接受了。许模克发现朋友脸上三个月来第一次有了点笑容，便一声不出地陪着他回诺曼底街。这一刹那的喜悦使德国人明白邦斯的心病到了什么程度。一个真正高尚的，胸襟如此洒脱，心灵如此伟大的人，竟会有这样的弱点！……那真使清心寡欲的许模克大为惊异又大为伤心了，因为他觉得为了使邦斯快乐，再不能天天和他一块儿吃饭。而这样的牺牲，他不知道自己能否忍受；想到这里他急坏了。

十九、从扇子说起


邦斯一怒之下躲在诺曼底街一声不出的傲气，当然引起庭长夫人的注意，可是她既然摆脱了吃白食的清客，也就不再为他操什么心。她和她可爱的女儿，都以为舅舅懂得了小丽丽开的玩笑。然而庭长先生的观感并不如此。矮胖的加缪索·特·玛维尔，自从在法院中的地位升高之后，变得更庄严了：他欣赏西塞罗，认为喜歌剧院比意大利剧院更高雅，喜欢把这个演员跟那个演员作比较，亦步亦趋地跟着群众；他能背出官方报纸上所有的评论，仿佛是他写的；在会议席上，他把先发言的法官的见解申说一番，就算是发表意见。除了这些主要性格之外，庭长的地位使他对什么都认真，尤其重视亲戚关系。像多数被女人控制的丈夫一样，庭长在小事情上故意独往独来，而太太也表示尊重。对于邦斯的杳无影踪，庭长夫人随便找些理由把庭长搪塞了个把月；可是久而久之，他觉得来往了四十年的老音乐家，正当送了一把蓬巴杜夫人的扇子那样贵重的礼物之后，反而不再上门，未免太古怪了。包比诺伯爵认为精品的那把扇子，在杜伊勒里宫中传观之下博得许多恭维，使庭长夫人听了得意之极；人家把十根象牙骨的美，细细指给她看，雕工的精巧真是从来未有的。在包比诺伯爵府上，一位俄国太太（俄国人到哪儿都以为是在俄国）愿意出六千法郎把扇子买过来；她觉得宝物落在这样的人手里太可惜了，因为那的确要公爵夫人才配得上。

听到有人出价之后，赛西尔第二天就对父亲说道：“我们不能不承认，可怜的舅公对这些小玩意儿倒真内行……”

“什么！小玩意儿？”庭长叫起来，“政府预备花三十万法郎，收买故杜索末拉参议官的收藏，另外还要跟巴黎市政府合凑一百万把格吕尼古堡买下来重修，存放这些小玩意儿呢！……告诉你，好孩子，这些小玩意儿往往是古代文明唯一的遗迹。一个伊特鲁里亚的古瓶或是一串项链，要值到四五万法郎一件；这些小玩意儿教我们见识到特洛伊战争时代的艺术多么完美，又告诉我们伊特鲁里亚人原来是特洛伊人逃难到意大利半岛去的！”

矮胖庭长的说笑便是这一类，他只会用毫无风趣的挖苦对付太太和女儿。

“赛西尔，你听着，”他又接着说，“要懂这些小玩意儿，需要好多种学问，那些学问的总名叫作考古学。考古学包括建筑、雕塑、绘画、金银细工、陶器、紫檀木雕——这是近代的新兴艺术——花边、地毯，总而言之，包括人类创造的一切工艺品。”

“那么邦斯舅舅是个学者了？”赛西尔问。

“哎！他怎么不来啦？”庭长问这句话的神气，仿佛一个人忘了好久的念头忽然集中，像猎人说的，瞄准了一点放出来，把自己吓了一跳。

“大概他为了一点小事生气了，”庭长太太回答，“他送这把扇子的时候，也许我没有表示充分的赏识。你知道，我是外行……”

“你！”庭长叫道，“你，赛尔凡教授的高足，会不知道华多？”

“我知道达维特、奚拉、葛罗，还有奚罗台、葛冷、特·福彭，丢尔班·特·克里赛……”

“你应当……”

“我应当什么，先生？”庭长太太瞪着丈夫的神气活像古代的示巴女王。

“应当知道华多是谁，我的好太太，他现在很时髦呢。”庭长的低声下气，显出他什么都是依仗太太得来的。

庭长夫妇谈这些话的时候，就在上演《魔鬼的未婚妻》，乐队里的人注意到邦斯脸色不好的那一晚的前几天。一向招待邦斯吃饭，拿他当信差用惯的人，那时都在打听邦斯的消息；并且在老人来往的小圈子内大家有点儿奇怪了，因为好几个人看见他明明在戏院里服务。邦斯在日常散步中虽是尽量避免从前的熟人，但有一天在新辟的菩玛希大街上一个古董铺里，冷不防跟前任部长包比诺伯爵照了面。那位古董商便是邦斯以前跟庭长太太提过的莫尼斯特洛；像他那批有名的有魄力的商人，都很狡猾地把古董天天抬价，推说货色越来越少，几乎找不到了。

包比诺一看见老人就说：“亲爱的邦斯，怎么看不见你啦？我们都在想你，内人还在问，你这样躲着我们是什么意思。”

“伯爵，”老人回答，“在一个亲戚家里，他们教我懂得像我这样年纪的人在社会上是多余的。一向他们就没有怎么敬重我，可是至少还没有侮辱我。我从来不有求于人，”他说到这里又流露出艺术家的傲气，“凡是瞧得起我招待我的人，我常常帮点儿小忙表示回敬；可是我发现我看错了，为了上亲戚朋友家吃饭，我就得含垢忍辱，笑骂由人！……好吧，吃白食这一行我现在不干了。在我家里，我每天都有无论哪一家的饭桌上都不会给我的享受——一个真正的朋友！”

老艺术家的手势、音调，使这番话更显得沉痛。包比诺听了不禁大为感动，把邦斯拉在一旁，说道：

“哎啊！老朋友，你怎么啦？能不能把你的伤心事告诉我呢？我敢说，在我家里总不至于有人对你失礼吧……”

“你是唯一的例外。况且你是一个王爷，一个政治家，有多少事要操心，即使有什么不周到，也应当原谅的。”

包比诺在应付人事与调度买卖上面学会了一套很高明的手腕；邦斯禁不起他三言两语，就说出了在玛维尔家的倒霉事儿。包比诺为他打抱不平，回家马上告诉了太太；她是一个热心而正派的女人，一见庭长太太就把她埋怨了一顿。同时，前任部长也跟庭长提了几句，使加缪索不得不追究这件事。虽然他在家里做不了什么主，但他这一次的责备于法于理都太有根据了，妻子和女儿都没法狡辩，只得屈居下风，把错处全推在仆役头上。那些用人给叫来骂了一顿。听到他们把事情从头至尾都招认之后，庭长才觉得邦斯舅舅的闭门不出真是最聪明的办法。跟大权操在主妇手中的那些主人一样，庭长把丈夫的威严、法官的威严一齐拿出来，说所有的仆役都得开差，连老用人应得的酬劳也要一律取消，倘若从今以后，他们对待邦斯舅舅和别的客人不像对他自己一样！玛特兰纳听了这句话，不由得微微一笑。

“你们只有一条生路，”庭长又说，“就是去向舅老爷赔罪，消他的气。告诉他，你们能不能留在这儿全在他手里，他要不原谅你们，我就把你们统统开差。”





二十、好日子回来了


第二天，庭长很早就出门，以便上法院之前去看他的舅舅。在西卜太太通报之下，玛维尔庭长的出现简直是件大事。邦斯还是破天荒第一次受到这样的荣誉，觉得这一定是重修旧好的预兆。

庭长寒暄了几句，就说：“亲爱的舅舅，我终于知道了你杜门不出的原因。你的行为使我对你更敬重了。关于那桩事，我只告诉你一句话：下人全给打发了。内人和小女都急得没了主意；她们想见见你，跟你解释一番。舅舅，在这件事情里头，我这个老法官是无辜的；小姑娘为了想上包比诺家吃饭，一时糊涂，没了规矩，可是请你别为此而责罚我，尤其现在我来向你求情，承认所有的错都在我们这方面……咱们三十六年的老交情，即使受了伤害，总还能使你给个面子吧。得啦！今晚请到我们家吃饭去，表示大家讲和……”

邦斯不知所云地回答了一大堆。结果说他乐队里一位同事辞了职要去办银行，今晚请他去参加订婚礼。

“那么明天吧。”

“外甥，明天我得上包比诺家吃饭，伯爵夫人写了封信来，真是客气得……”

“那么后天……”

“后天，我那位乐师的合伙人，一个姓勃罗纳的德国人，请新夫妇吃饭……”

“哦，你人缘多好，这么些人都争着请你，”庭长说，“好吧，那么下星期日，八天之内，像我们法院里说的。”

“哎，那天我们要到乐师的丈人葛拉夫家里吃饭……”

“那么就下星期六吧！这期间，请你抽空去安慰安慰我那小姑娘，她已经痛哭流涕地忏悔过了。上帝也只要求人忏悔，你对可怜的赛西尔总不至于比上帝更严吧？……”

邦斯被人抓到了弱点，不由得说了一番谦逊不遑的话，把庭长一直送到楼梯头。一小时以后，庭长家的那些仆役来了，拿出下人们卑鄙无耻、欺善怕恶的嘴脸，居然哭了！玛特兰纳特意把邦斯先生拉在一边，跪倒在他脚下，哭哭啼啼地说：

“先生，一切都是我做的，先生知道我是爱您的。那桩该死的事，只怪我恼羞成怒，迷了心窍。现在我们连年金都要丢了！……先生，我固然疯了，可不愿意连累同伴……现在我知道没有高攀先生的福分。我想明白了，当初不该有那么大的野心，可是先生，我是永远爱您的。十年工夫，我只想使您幸福，到这儿来服侍您。那才是好福气呢！……噢，要是先生能知道我的心！……我做的一切缺德的事，先生早该发觉……倘使我明儿死了，您知道人家会找到什么？……一张遗嘱！我在遗嘱上把一切都送给先生……真的，遗嘱就藏在我箱子里，压在首饰底下！”

玛特兰纳这番话打动了老鳏夫的心，使他觉得非常舒服；有人为你颠倒，哪怕是你不喜欢的人，你的自尊心总很得意。老人宽宏大量地原谅了玛特兰纳，又原谅了其余的人，说他会向庭长夫人说情，把他们全部留下的。

邦斯看到不失身份而能重享昔日之乐，真有说不出的欢喜。这一回是人家来求他的，他的尊严只会增加；但他把这些得意事儿说给许模克听的时候，看到朋友悒郁不欢，嘴上不说而明明在怀疑的神气，他觉得很难受。可是好心的德国人，发觉邦斯脸色突然之间转好了，终于也很快慰，而情愿牺牲他四个月来独占朋友的那种幸福。

心病比身病有个大占便宜的地方：只要不能满足的欲望得到了满足，它就会霍然而愈。邦斯在那天早上完全变了一个人。愁眉苦脸、病病歪歪的老人，立刻变得心满意足，神魂安定，跟以前拿着蓬巴杜夫人的扇子，去送给庭长太太时一样。可是许模克对这个现象只觉得莫名其妙，不由得左思右想地出神了。真正清心寡欲的人，是永远不能了解法国人逢迎吹拍的习气的。邦斯彻头彻尾是个帝政时代的法国人，一方面讲究上一世纪的风流蕴藉，一方面极崇拜女性像“动身上叙利亚……”那个流行歌曲所称道的那种风气。于是许模克把悲哀埋在心里，用他德国人的哲学遮盖起来；可是一个星期后他脸色发黄了，西卜太太用了些小手段把本区的医生请了来。医生怕许模克是害的黄疸病，但他不说黄疸而说了一个医学上的专门名词，把西卜太太吓坏了。

两个朋友一同在外边吃饭也许还是破题儿第一遭，但许模克觉得仿佛回到德国去玩了一次。莱茵旅馆的主人，约翰·葛拉夫，他的女儿哀弥丽，裁缝伏弗更·葛拉夫和他的太太，弗列兹·勃罗纳和威廉·希华勃，全是德国人。请的来宾只有邦斯和公证人两位是法国人。葛拉夫裁缝，在小新田街与维勒杜街之间的黎塞留街上有所华丽的大宅子，他们的侄女就在这儿长大的；因为做父亲的怕旅馆里来往的人太杂，不愿意让女儿接触。裁缝夫妇对侄女视同己出，决意把屋子的底层让给小夫妻俩；而勃罗纳—希华勃银行将来也设在这里。

以上的计划才不过决定了一个月光景，因为这些喜事的主角勃罗纳，执管遗产也得等待相当时间。裁缝给新夫妇置办家具，把住房粉刷一新。老屋子坐落在花园与院子之间，侧面有一进屋子预备做银行的办公室，从那儿可以通到临街一幢出租的漂亮屋子。





二十一、一个妻子要多少开支


从诺曼底街到黎塞留街的路上，邦斯向心不在焉的许模克打听出浪子的故事，知道旅馆主人那块肥肉竟给死神送到了浪子嘴里。邦斯才跟他的至亲言归于好，立刻想替弗列兹·勃罗纳跟赛西尔·特·玛维尔做媒。碰巧葛拉夫家的公证人又是加陶以前的书记，后来盘下他的事务所又做了他的女婿，邦斯过去常在他家吃饭的。

“哦，原来是你，贝蒂哀先生。”老音乐家向他旧日的居停主人伸出手去。

“哎，你怎么不赏光上我们家吃饭啦？”公证人问，“内人正在挂念你呢。《魔鬼的未婚妻》初次上演那一晚，我们在戏院里看见你，所以我们非常挂念，并且奇怪了。”

“老年人是很会多心的，”邦斯回答，“我们错就错在落后一个世纪；可是有什么法儿？……代表一个世纪已经够受了，再要跟上那个看到我们老死的时代是办不到的了。”

“对！”公证人很俏皮地抢着说，“咱们不能一箭双雕赶上两个世纪。”

“哎喂！”老人把年轻的公证人拉在一旁问，“你干吗不替我的外孙女赛西尔做媒呢？”

“你问我干吗？……这年月连门房都在讲究奢侈了；巴黎高等法院庭长的小姐，只有十万法郎陪嫁，你想年轻人敢请教吗？在玛维尔小姐那个社会里，一年只花丈夫三千法郎的妻子还没听见过。十万法郎的利息，给太太做开销还并不怎么足够。一个单身汉，有着一万五到两万的进款，住着一个精致的小公寓，用不着铺张，只消雇一个男当差，全部收入都可以拿去寻欢作乐，除了要裁缝把他装扮得体体面面之外，不需要别的场面。有远见的母亲们都对他另眼相看，他在巴黎交际场中是一等红人。反之，娶了太太就得撑一个家，她要一辆自己独用的车，上戏院就得要个包厢，不比单身汉只消正厅的散座就行了；总而言之，从前年轻人自个儿享受的钱，现在都得拿给太太去花。假定一对夫妻有三万进款，在眼前这个社会上，有钱的单身汉马上会变作穷小子，连上香蒂伊去玩一次也得计算车钱了。再加上孩子……那就窘相毕露了。玛维尔先生跟玛维尔太太不过五十开外，他们的遗产还要等十五年二十年；没有一个男人愿意把遗产放在皮包里搁上这么些年的；这样计算之下，那些在玛皮伊舞场跟妓女跳着包尔加舞的胡天胡地的小伙子，心里就长了疙瘩，所有未婚的青年都会研究一下这个问题的两面，也用不着我们提醒他们。并且，咱们之间说句老实话，玛维尔小姐长得并不教人动心，也就不会教人糊涂，候选人见了她只打着不结婚的主意。倘若一个头脑清楚，有两万法郎收入的年轻人，想攀一门能满足他野心的亲事，那么玛维尔小姐还不够资格……”

“为什么？”邦斯很诧异地问。

“嗳！……如今的男人，哪怕像你我一样的丑吧，亲爱的邦斯，都痴心妄想地要六万法郎陪嫁，高门大族的小姐，长得非常漂亮，人要非常风雅，非常有教养，总之要没有一点疤瘢的完璧。”

“那么我的小外孙女是不容易嫁掉的了？”

“只要她父亲舍不得把玛维尔的田产给她做陪嫁，赛西尔就无人问津；要是她父母肯那么办，她早已做了包比诺子爵夫人……，勃罗纳先生来啦，我们要宣读勃罗纳公司的合同和希华勃的婚约了。”

邦斯被介绍过了，彼此客气了一番，家长们请他在婚书上也署个名，做个证人。他听人家把合同的条款都念完了，然后到五点光景，大家走进餐厅。酒席的丰腴，就像大腹贾们搁下买卖预备享受一下的那种盛宴，同时证明莱茵旅馆的主人葛拉夫，跟巴黎第一流的伙食商多么够交情。邦斯和许模克从来没有见识过这样讲究的吃喝。有的是教你神魂颠倒的名菜！……面条的细净是破天荒的，香鲇鱼给炸得没有话说，真正的莱芒湖鱼，配上真正的日内瓦沙司，葡萄干布丁上的乳脂之美，连传说发明布丁的那个伦敦名医都要为之叫绝。酒席到晚上十点才散。喝的莱茵酒和法国酒的数量，使公子哥儿都要吃惊，因为德国人能够声色不动地灌下多少酒精，简直没有人说得出。你必须在德国吃过饭，眼看多少酒瓶连续不断地给端上来，像地中海浴场上的潮水，前波逐着后波，又眼看多少酒瓶给撤下去，仿佛德国人吸收的能力就跟沙滩和海绵一样；而他们又吸收得多么文雅，没有法国人的喧闹：谈话照常很幽静，像放印子钱的人的闲谈，脱尽火气；脸上的红晕，有如高乃吕斯或舒奈壁画上的未婚夫妻的，若有若无；而往事的回忆，也像烟斗里飘起来的烟，来得慢腾腾的。

十点半，邦斯和许模克坐在花园里一条凳上，把希华勃夹在中间，也不知是谁把谈话引到了诉说彼此的性情、见解和不幸的遭遇上去。在一大堆炒什锦似的心腹话中间，威廉讲起他想要弗列兹结婚的愿望，乘着酒意把话说得慷慨激昂。

“为你的朋友，我有个计划在这里，你看怎样？”邦斯凑着威廉的耳朵说，“有个可爱的、懂事的姑娘，二十四岁，门第很高，父亲是司法界的一个大官儿，十万法郎陪嫁，将来还有一百万法郎家产的希望。”

“你等着！”希华勃回答，“我马上跟弗列兹说去。”

于是两位音乐家看着勃罗纳和他的朋友在花园里绕圈子，在他的面前走过好几回，一忽儿这个听着那个说，一忽儿那个听着这个讲。邦斯脑袋沉甸甸的，虽没有完全喝醉，可是觉得身子越沉重，思想越轻灵；透过酒精遮在他面前的云雾，他打量着弗列兹·勃罗纳，想在他脸上找出一点想过家庭生活的愿望。不久希华勃把他的朋友兼合伙人给邦斯介绍了。弗列兹对老人的关切再三道谢，然后彼此谈起话来。许模克与邦斯一对单身汉，尽量歌颂结婚的好处，毫无俏皮意味地提到那句双关语，说结婚是人生的终极。等到在未来的洞房里饮冰、喝茶、呷着杂合酒、吃着甜点心的时候，那些差不多全醉了的富商听到银行的大股东也要结婚的话，顿时叫叫嚷嚷，热闹到了极点。

清早两点，许模克和邦斯打大街上走回家，一路大发议论，觉得尘世的一切都配得像音乐一样和谐，他们拿这个当作题目，说得连自己都忘其所以了。





二十二、邦斯送了庭长太太一件比蓬巴杜夫人的扇子更名贵的艺术品


第二天，邦斯上他外甥媳妇庭长太太家里去了，他因为能够以德报怨而满心欢喜。可怜这心胸高尚的好人！……没有问题，他是到了超凡入圣的境界。现在大家对一般尽本分的、照着福音书行事的人，尚且在分发蒙底翁道德奖金，那么上面那句关于邦斯的话一定不会有人反对的了。

“嘿！他们要欠吃白食的一个大大的情分呢！”他在旭阿梭街上拐弯的时候这么想着。

一个不像邦斯那么得意忘形的人，一个懂世故的、知道提防的人，回到这份人家去一定会留神庭长太太和她女儿的态度的；但可怜的音乐家是个孩子，是个天真的艺术家，他只相信道德的善，犹如他只相信艺术的美；赛西尔和庭长太太的殷勤使他快活之极。这老实人，十二年来尽看着杂剧、喜剧、悲剧在眼前搬演，竟看不透人生舞台上牛鬼蛇神的嘴脸，其实他是早该看饱了的。庭长夫人的心跟身子一样的干枯，可是非常热衷，拼命要显出贤德，装作虔诚，因为在家里支配惯了，格外老气横秋。凡是在巴黎社会上混惯而懂得这一类女子的人，自会想象得到，自从庭长夫人向丈夫认错以后，她心中对舅舅抱着多深的仇恨。母女俩面上是笑脸相迎，内里都打着此仇必报的主意，不过暂时把敌忾之心压在那里罢了。阿曼丽·加缪索生平第一次向丈夫低头，而丈夫是她一向当作孩子看待的；可是现在她还得对那个使她吃败仗的人表示亲热！……这个情形，只有红衣主教之间或教会宗派的领袖之间，那种年深月久、口是心非的亲善可以相比。

三点钟，庭长从法院里回来，邦斯还没有把故事讲完。他说出认识弗列兹·勃罗纳的那番奇妙的经过，从昨天吃到今天清早的酒席，以及一切有关勃罗纳的细节。赛西尔直截了当地提到正文，打听勃罗纳衣着的款式如何，身腰如何，举动如何，头发什么颜色，眼睛什么颜色；等到她揣摩出弗列兹是个漂亮人物之后，便称赞他的豪爽了。

“对一个患难朋友一出手就是五十万！噢，妈妈，我的车子跟意大利剧院的包厢都不成问题啦……”

母亲为她所抱的野心，她自己唯恐成为泡影的希望，一下子都要实现了：赛西尔想到这里，人也差不多变得好看了。

至于庭长夫人，她只说一句话：“亲爱的小妞子，你十五天之内就可以结婚了。”

所有的母亲都把二十三岁的女儿叫作小妞子的。

“可是，”庭长说，“要打听对方的底细总还得有些时间；我决不肯把女儿随便给一个陌生人……”

“你要打听，只消问贝蒂哀，他们的合同和婚书都是他经手的，”老艺术家回答，“至于那小伙子，我的甥少奶，你该记得你和我说过的话！他已经过了四十岁，头发只剩一半了。他想成了家有个避风的港口，我自然不去劝阻他；这也是人的天性……”

“那就更需要打听勃罗纳先生的情形了，”庭长抢着说，“我不愿意给女儿招个病病歪歪的女婿。”

“甥少奶，要是你愿意，五天之内就可以看到那个男的，你自己去判断吧；照你的意思，似乎只要见一次面就行了……”

赛西尔和母亲做了一个极高兴的姿势。邦斯舅舅接着又道：

“弗列兹是个很高明的鉴赏家，他想仔细瞧瞧我的小收藏。你们从来没见过我的画我的古董；就来看看吧，”他对两位女主人说，“你们装作是我的朋友许模克陪来的，尽可不露痕迹地跟对方认识。弗列兹绝对不会知道你们是谁。”

“妙极了！”庭长叫着。

从前被人瞧不起的食客现在受到怎样的敬重，是不难想象的了。那天可怜的人才真是庭长夫人的舅舅。快活的母亲，心中的仇恨给欢乐的巨潮淹没了，竟装出那种眼神，堆起那种笑容，想出那种说话，教老实人喜欢得魂都没有了；他觉得自己不但做了桩好事，而且还有个美丽的远景。将来在勃罗纳家、希华勃家、葛拉夫家，不是都有像订婚那天一样的酒席等他吗？他眼见酒醉饭饱的日子到了：一连串盖着碟子端出来的菜，意想不到的异味，妙不可言的陈年佳酿！

邦斯走了以后，庭长对太太说：“倘若邦斯舅舅做媒做成了，就得送他一笔年金，相当于他乐队指挥的薪水。”

“那当然喽。”庭长太太回答。他们决定，要是赛西尔看得中那个男的，就由她去教老音乐家收下这笔不登大雅的津贴。

为了对弗列兹·勃罗纳的家私找些真凭实据，庭长下一天就去看贝蒂哀。贝蒂哀预先得到庭长夫人的通知，把他的新主顾、笛师出身的银行家希华勃约了来。希华勃一听朋友可能攀上这样一门亲，不由得惊喜交集（大家知道德国人是多么看重头衔的，在德国，一位太太不是元帅夫人，便是参议夫人，或是律师夫人），他对谈判处处迁就，仿佛一个收藏家自以为教古董商上了当，占了便宜似的。

“第一，”赛西尔的父亲对希华勃说，“因为我想在婚书上把玛维尔的产业给女儿，我要采取奁赠制度。勃罗纳先生得拿出一百万来扩充玛维尔庄田，凑成一份奁赠产业，使我女儿和她的孩子们将来不至于受到银行的风波。”

贝蒂哀摸着下巴颏儿想道：“庭长先生倒真有一招！”

希华勃问明了什么叫作奁赠制度[1]，立刻代朋友一口承应。这项条件正好符合朋友的愿望，因为弗列兹曾经表示，希望成家的时候能有个办法，使他不致重蹈覆辙。

“眼前就有一百二十万法郎的农场跟草原预备出让。”庭长又说。

“法兰西银行的一百万股票，作我们往来的保证金是尽够的了，”希华勃回答，“弗列兹也不愿意在生意上的投资超过二百万；庭长的条件，他一定会接受的。”

听到庭长回家报告这些消息，两位妇女简直乐死了。在捕婿的网里，从来没有这样的一条大鱼肯这样听人摆布的。

“你将来可以叫作勃罗纳·特·玛维尔太太，”父亲对女儿说，“我要替你丈夫正式申请用这个姓；以后他还能获得法国籍。要是我当了贵族院议员，他可以承继我！”

庭长夫人花了五天工夫装扮女儿。相亲那天，她亲自替赛西尔穿衣，在化妆上细磨细琢所费的心血，不下于英国舰队的司令官的装配那艘游艇，让英国女王坐了上德国去访问。

另一方面，邦斯和许模克，把邦斯的美术馆、屋子、家具，掸尘抹灰的那股劲儿，好比水手擦洗海军司令的战舰。雕花的木器连一星灰都没有。所有的铜器都闪闪发光。粉笔画外面的玻璃，教人把拉都、格勒兹、李奥太（他是那张不能经久的名画[2]《巧克力女郎》的作者）的作品看得格外分明。佛罗伦萨铜雕上神妙的珐琅，毫光四射，变化无穷。彩色玻璃上细腻的颜色，绚烂夺目。在两个诗人一般的音乐家布置之下，那些杰作都放出异彩，发出声音，直叩你的心，使这个展览会同时也成为一个音乐会。

二十三、一个德国念头


两位妇女相当聪明，懂得避免进场时的发窘，便抢着先到，以便巩固自己的阵地。邦斯把他的朋友许模克介绍了，被她们看作个呆子。一心想着四百万富翁的新郎，两个无知的女人听着邦斯关于艺术的解释简直不大在意。她们很冷淡的，瞧着三个精美的框子里铺在红丝绒上的贝蒂多彩色珐琅。梵·海以森、达维特和埃姆的花卉，亚伯拉罕·米尼翁的草虫，凡·艾克，丢勒，真正的克拉纳赫，乔尔乔内，塞巴斯蒂亚诺·德·皮翁博，巴古逊，霍贝玛，奚里谷，所有的名画都引不起她们的好奇心，因为她们等着照明这些实物的太阳。可是看到某些伊特鲁里亚的首饰，一望而知是贵重的鼻烟壶，两位妇女也觉得惊奇。她们正为了敷衍主人而拿着佛罗伦萨铜雕出神的时候，西卜太太通报勃罗纳先生来了！她们并不转过身子，却利用一面镶着大块紫檀木雕花框的威尼斯镜子，来打量这个天下无双的候选人。

弗列兹得到威廉的通知，把仅有的一些头发集中在一处，穿一条颜色很深而调子很柔和的裤子，一件大方而新式的绸背心，一件有空眼子的荷兰细布衬衫，系一条白地蓝条的领带。表链和手杖柄是法劳朗—夏诺的出品。上衣是葛拉夫老头挑最好的料子亲手裁剪的。那双瑞典皮的手套就显出他是个吃光母亲遗产的哥儿。要是两位娘儿们没有听到诺曼底街上的车声，单看他光可鉴人的靴子，也能想象出银行家的低矮的双马篷车。

既然二十岁的浪子就有银行家的神气，到四十岁上当然成为察言观色的老手了，而且勃罗纳特别精明，因为他还懂得一个德国人可以凭他的天真取胜。那天早上，正如一个人到了或是娶妻生子，或是花天酒地继续独身下去的关头，他眉宇之间颇有怅然神往的意味。在一个法国化的德国人身上，这种表情使赛西尔觉得他真是小说中人物。她把维拉士的后人认作少年维特。再说，哪个姑娘不把她的结婚史编成一部小小的传奇呢？勃罗纳对四十年的耐性所搜集的那些精品看得非常有劲，邦斯因为第一次有人赏识他收藏的真价值，也十分高兴，而赛西尔更觉得自己是世界上最幸福的女人。

她心里想：“哦，他是一个诗人！他把这些玩意儿看作值几百万。诗人是不会计算的，能让太太支配家产的；那种人很容易对付，只消让他玩玩无聊的小东西就什么都不问了。”

老人卧房的两扇窗上，每块玻璃都是瑞士古代的彩色玻璃，最起码的一块也值到一千法郎，而他一共有十六块，全是现代收藏家不惜到处寻访的精品。一八一五年，这些花玻璃每方只卖六法郎到十法郎。藏的六十幅画又无一不精，无一不真，没有经后人补过一笔，它们的价钱只有在拍卖行紧张的情绪中才见分晓。给每幅画做陪衬的框子又是些无价之宝，式样应有尽有：有威尼斯造的，大块的雕花像现代英国餐具上的装饰；有罗马造的，那是以艺术家的卖弄技巧出名的；有西班牙造的，把枯干老藤雕得多么大胆；有佛兰德的，有德国的，刻满了天真的人物；有嵌锡、嵌铜、嵌螺钿、嵌象牙的贝壳框子，有紫檀的、黄杨的、黄铜的框子；有路易十三式的，路易十四式的，路易十五式的，路易十六式的。总之，最美丽的款式都给包括尽了，可以说是独一无二的收藏。邦斯比德累斯顿与维也纳的美术馆馆员更运气，他藏有大名鼎鼎、号称木雕上的米开朗琪罗的勃罗多洛纳手造的一个框子。

不消说，玛维尔小姐见到每样新古董都要求说明。她请勃罗纳介绍她认识那些奇珍异宝。听到弗列兹说出一幅画、一座雕像、一个铜器的美跟价值，她显得那么快活，惊讶赞美之声那么天真，使德国人有了生气，脸也变得年轻了。结果双方都越出了预定的范围，以初次会面而论是表示得过火了一些，因为他们始终自认为偶然相遇的。

他们在一起一共有三小时。下楼的时候，勃罗纳搀着赛西尔的胳膊。赛西尔很聪明地放慢了脚步，老在那儿谈着美术，觉得那男的把邦斯舅舅的古董赞不绝口有些奇怪。

“我们刚才看的那些东西，你认为值很多钱吗？”

“哎，小姐，倘若邦斯先生肯出让他的收藏，我立刻可以出八十万法郎，而这还是桩好买卖。标卖的时候，单是六十幅画就不止值这些。”

“既然你这么说，我当然相信，”她回答，“那一定假不了，因为你全副精神都在那些东西上面。”

“噢！小姐……”勃罗纳叫道，“给你这么一说，我没有话回答了，我只能请求令堂大人允许我到府上去拜访她，让我能不胜荣幸地再看到你。”

庭长夫人紧跟在女儿后面，心里想：“瞧我的小妞子多机灵！”然后她高声说：“欢迎之至，先生。希望你和我们的邦斯舅舅一同来吃饭；庭长能够见见你才高兴呢……多谢，舅舅！”

她把邦斯的胳膊紧抓了一把，那意义比“咱们这是生死不变的了！”那样神圣的话还有过之无不及。她一边说着“多谢，舅舅”，一边对他抛了个媚眼。

等到把小姐送上车，出租马车拐进了夏洛街之后，勃罗纳跟邦斯谈着古董，邦斯跟勃罗纳谈着亲事。

“你说，没有问题吧？……”邦斯问。

“哦！小姑娘无聊得很，母亲的神气有点儿僵……咱们再谈吧。”

“将来的家私可不小，”邦斯特别点醒他，“有一百万以上呢……”

“星期一见！”百万富翁打断了他的话，“倘若你愿意出让你的画，我可以出五六十万法郎……”

“噢！”老人叫起来，他想不到自己会有这么大的家私，“我唯一的快乐就靠这些画……要卖也只能在我身后交货。”

“好，慢慢再说吧……”

“这一下倒发动了两件事啦。”收藏家心中只想着婚事。

勃罗纳向邦斯行了礼，坐上华丽的马车走了。邦斯目送小篷车渐渐远去，没有注意到在门口抽着烟斗的雷蒙诺克。





二十四、空中楼阁


当天晚上，玛维尔庭长夫人跟公公去商量，碰巧包比诺全家人马也在那儿。做母亲的没有能招到一个亲戚的儿子做女婿，自然想等机会出口气；玛维尔太太便透露一些口风，表示赛西尔攀了一门了不起的好亲事。“赛西尔攀给了谁呢？”大家异口同声地问。于是，庭长太太自以为守着秘密，说了好多半吞半吐的话，也说了好多咬耳朵的心腹话，再加贝蒂哀太太从旁证实，使那件事第二天在邦斯吃饭的小圈子里归纳成这样的几句：

“赛西尔·特·玛维尔攀了一个年轻的德国人，存心济世的银行家，噢！他有四百万呢；简直是小说中人物，真正的少年维特，极有风度，心地极好，早年也荒唐过来，这一下可发疯似的爱上了赛西尔；真是一见生情，连邦斯画上所有的圣母都比不过赛西尔一个，你说这爱情还不可靠吗？”诸如此类。

再过一天，有几位客人上门来向庭长太太道喜，目的只为探探是否真有那颗金牙齿[1]，庭长夫人那套措辞巧妙、大同小异的对答，可以给所有的母亲做参考，好似从前大家参考《尺牍大全》一样。

“一桩婚事，”她对希弗维尔太太说，“直要等新人从区公所跟教堂里回来才算确定，而我们这时还不过在相亲的阶段；所以我希望你看在我们的老交情面上，别在外边张扬……”

“你好福气，庭长太太，这年月结亲也真不容易。”

“可不是！这一回是碰巧；不过婚姻多半是这样成功的。”

“哎，赛西尔真的要大喜了吗？”加陶太太问。

“是的，”庭长夫人懂得对方用“真的”二字挖苦她，“我们一向太苛求，耽搁了赛西尔的亲事。现在可是一切条件都齐备了：财产，性情，品格，而且长得一表人才。我亲爱的小姑娘也的确配得上这些。勃罗纳先生非常可爱，非常漂亮；他喜欢排场，见过世面，可是爱赛西尔爱得发疯似的，真诚得不得了；所以，虽然他有三四百万，赛西尔也牺牲了清高的念头接受了……我们并没这么大的野心，可是……有钱总不至于坏事。”

庭长夫人对勒巴太太说的又是一套：“噢！我们决意应允他，倒并非为他的财产，而是为他对赛西尔的感情。勃罗纳先生急得很，希望满了法定期限就结婚[2]。”

“听说他是一个外国人？……”

“是的，太太；可是老实说，我觉得很高兴。我将来不是招了个女婿，而是得了个儿子。勃罗纳先生真是太懂事了。你简直想不到他对奁赠制度会那么高兴地接受……这是对家属最可靠的保障……他要买一百二十万法郎的农场和草原，并入玛维尔田庄。”

第二天，她又把同样的题目做了几篇不同的文章。据说勃罗纳先生是个王爷，行事全是王爷气派，从来不斤斤较量；要是玛维尔先生替他弄到了完全国籍[3]（以庭长的勋劳，司法部也应当为他破一次小小的例），女婿将来可以承继岳父做贵族院议员。没有人知道勃罗纳先生的家私有多大，他养着全巴黎最好的马，有全巴黎装备最好的车……诸如此举。

加缪索一家兴高采烈的宣传，正好说明这件事在他们是喜出望外的。

在邦斯舅舅家相过亲以后，玛维尔先生受着太太怂恿，立刻邀请司法部长、高等法院的首席庭长、检察署长，在理想的女婿晋谒那天到家里来吃饭。虽然约的日子很局促，三位大人物居然答应了；他们懂得家长希望他们扮的角色，也就不吝臂助。对那些想钓个有钱女婿的母亲，法国人都很乐意帮忙的。包比诺伯爵夫妇虽然觉得这种请客有些俗气，也答应来凑满那一天的贵宾名单。客人一共有十一位。其中当然少不了赛西尔的祖父，老加缪索和他的太太。请这顿饭的目的，是预备以那些客人的地位声望，使勃罗纳先生当天就开口求亲。至于勃罗纳，像上文所说的，早已给描写成一个德国的大资本家，鉴赏力极高（有他对小妞子的爱情为证），将来在银行界准是纽沁根、格雷、杜·蒂哀等等的劲敌。

庭长夫人装着挺随便的神气，把当天的客人告诉她心目中的女婿。“今天是我们每星期照例的便饭，只有熟客，并无外人。先是庭长的父亲，想你已经知道，他不久就要晋升为贵族院议员了；其次是包比诺伯爵和伯爵夫人，虽说他们的儿子因为财产不够，配不上赛西尔，我们照旧是好朋友；还有是我们的司法部长，我们的首席庭长，我们的检察署长，都是些熟朋友……我们开饭要晚一些，因为议院总得六点钟散会。”

勃罗纳意味深长地瞅着邦斯，邦斯搓着手，仿佛说：“是呀，都是我们的朋友，我的朋友！……”

机灵的庭长夫人有话要跟舅舅谈，让赛西尔跟她的维特单独在一块儿。赛西尔拉拉扯扯说了好多话，故意教弗列兹瞧见她藏在一边的一本德文字典，一本德文文法，一本歌德的集子。

“哦！你在学德文？”勃罗纳说着，不由得脸上一红。

世界上只有法国女人才会想出这种迷人的圈套。

“噢！这怎么行！……怎么可以翻我的东西呢，先生？”她又补上两句，“我想读原文的歌德，已经念了两年德文了。”

“大概文法很难懂吧，书还只裁开了十页[4]……”勃罗纳很天真地说。

赛西尔羞得马上转过身去，不让他看见脸上的红晕。德国人是经不起这种诱惑的，他挽着赛西尔的手把她拉回来，瞧得她好难为情的，他的眼神，和奥古斯德·拉·封丹小说中那些未婚夫妻的一样。

“你可爱极了！”他说。

赛西尔做了个热烈的手势，表示说：“可是你呢！谁见了你不喜欢呢？”

庭长夫人和邦斯回进客厅，女儿凑在她耳边说：“事情很顺当，妈妈！”

在这种晚会中，一个家庭的景象是不容易描写的。看到母亲为女儿俘获了一个有钱的夫婿，每个人都觉得高兴。大家对新人和家长说些双关的或针对双方的吉利话；在听的人方面，勃罗纳只是装聋作傻，赛西尔是心领神会，庭长是但愿多听几句。邦斯全身的血都在耳朵里嗡嗡作响，仿佛看到他戏院里台上全部的脚灯都亮了起来，因为赛西尔很巧妙地、悄悄地告诉他，说父亲有意思送他一千二百法郎年金；老人当下便坚决地谢绝了，说他自己有的是财产，勃罗纳最近不是提醒了他吗？

部长、首席庭长、检察署长、包比诺夫妇，那些忙人都走了，只剩下老加缪索、退休的公证人加陶和在场招呼他的贝蒂哀。邦斯这好好先生以为都是自己人了，便非常不雅地向庭长夫妇道谢赛西尔刚才的提议。好心肠的人都是这样的，什么都凭感情冲动。勃罗纳觉得这笔年金等于给邦斯的佣金，不由得犯了犹太人的疑心病，立刻变得心不在焉，表示他不光是在冷冷地打算盘。

“我的收藏或是它的售价，不管我跟我的朋友勃罗纳做成交易也罢，我保留下去也罢，将来终是归你们家里的。”邦斯这样告诉他的亲戚。他们听到他有着这么大的财富都很吃惊。

勃罗纳冷眼旁观，注意到那些俗物对邦斯从穷光蛋一变而为有产人士以后的好感，同时也发觉赛西尔是给父母宠惯的全家的偶像，便有心教这些布尔乔亚诧异一下，惊叹几声。

他说：“关于邦斯先生的收藏，我对小姐说的数目只是我出的价；以独一无二的艺术品而论，没有人敢预言这个收藏在标卖的时候能值多少。单是六十幅画就可能卖到一百万，其中有好几张都值到五万一幅。”

“做你的继承人倒真有福气喽。”加陶对邦斯说。

“嗳，我的继承人不就是我的小外孙赛西尔吗？”老人绝对不肯放松他的亲戚关系。

这句话使在场的人都对老音乐家表示不胜钦佩。

“那她将来好发笔大财啦。”加陶一边笑着说一边告辞了。

那时屋子里只有老加缪索、庭长、庭长夫人、赛西尔、勃罗纳、贝蒂哀和邦斯，大家以为男的就要正式开口了。果然，等到只剩下这些人的时候，勃罗纳问了一句话，父母一听就觉得是好预兆。

“我想小姐是独养女儿吧……”勃罗纳问庭长太太。

“一点不错。”她很骄傲地回答。

“所以你跟谁都不会有纠葛的。”好人邦斯凑上一句，让勃罗纳能放心大胆地提亲。

勃罗纳却上了心事，没有下文了，屋子里顿时冷冰冰的有些异样的感觉。庭长夫人那句话仿佛是承认女儿害了瘟疫。庭长觉得女儿这时不应该在场，便对她递了个眼色。她出去了。勃罗纳还是不作声。大家你望着我，我望着你，成了僵局。幸亏老加缪索经验丰富，把德国人带往庭长太太屋里，只说要拿邦斯找来的扇子给他瞧瞧。他猜到一定是临时有了问题，便向儿子媳妇做个暗号，教他们留在客厅里。

“你瞧瞧这件好东西！”老绸缎商拿出扇子来。

“值五千法郎。”勃罗纳仔细看过了回答。

“先生，你不是来向我孙女求婚的吗？”

“是的，先生。你可以相信，我觉得这样一门亲事对我是莫大的荣幸。我从来没见过比赛西尔小姐更美，更可爱，对我更合适的姑娘；可是……”

“噢！用不着可是，要不就把可是的意义马上说给我听……”

“先生，”勃罗纳郑重其事地回答，“我很高兴我们彼此还没有什么约束，因为大家把独养女儿的资格看作了不得的优点，我可完全看不出好处，反而觉得是个极大的障碍……”

“怎么，先生，”老人大为诧异，“你会把天大的利益看作缺点的？你这个观念未免太古怪了，我倒要请教一下你的理由呢。”

“先生，”德国人的态度非常冷静，“我今晚到府上来，是预备向庭长先生求亲的。我有心替赛西尔小姐安排一个美丽的前程，把我的财产献给她。可是一个独养女儿是被父母优容惯的，从来没人违拗她的意志。我见过好些人家都供奉这一类的女神，这儿也不能例外：令孙女不但是府上的偶像，而且庭长夫人还加上些……你也知道，不必我多说了。先生，我眼见先父的家庭生活为了这个缘故变成了地狱。我所有的灾难都是我后母一手造成的，她便是人家百般疼爱的独养女儿，没有出嫁的时候千娇百媚，结了婚简直是魔鬼的化身。我不说赛西尔小姐不是一个例外；可是我年纪不轻，已经到四十岁，因年龄差别而发生的龃龉，使我没有把握教一个年轻的女人快活，因为庭长对她百依百顺惯了，她的话平日在家里像圣旨一样。我有什么权利要求赛西尔小姐改变她的思想跟习惯呢？过去她使些小性子，父亲母亲都乐于迁就的，将来和一个四十岁的中年人相处，她可是自私自利的呢；她要固执一下，低头服输的准是那个中年人。所以我采取老老实实的办法，把来意打消了。再说，我只到这儿来拜访一次，倘使必要的话，我愿意牺牲我自己[5]……”

“先生，倘若你的理由是这样，”未来的贵族院议员说，“那么虽然有些古怪，倒也言之成理……”

“先生，千万别怀疑我的诚意，”勃罗纳立刻接过他的话，“要是在一个兄弟姊妹很多的家庭里有个可怜的姑娘，尽管毫无财产，只消教养很好——那种人家在法国很多——只消我认为她品性优良，我就会娶她。”

说到这里，彼此不作声了，弗列兹·勃罗纳趁此丢下老祖父，出来向庭长夫妇客客气气行了礼，走了。赛西尔面无人色地回进客厅，把少年维特匆匆告辞的意义揭晓了；她躲在母亲的更衣室里把话全听了去。

“他回绝了！……”她咬着母亲的耳朵说。

“为什么？”庭长夫人问她的公公，他神气非常不自然。

“推说独养女儿都是宠惯的孩子，”老人回答，“嗯，这句话倒也不能完全派他错。”他因为二十年来给媳妇磨得厌烦死了，乐得借此顶她一下。

“我女儿会气死的！你要她的命了！……”庭长夫人扶着女儿对邦斯叫着。赛西尔听了就顺水推舟倒在母亲怀里。

庭长夫妇俩把女儿扶在一张椅子上，她终于完全晕了过去。祖父便打铃叫人。

二十五、邦斯给结石压倒了


“我看出来了，这是你的阴谋诡计！”狂怒的母亲指着可怜的邦斯说。

邦斯浑身一震，好似听到了最后审判的号角。

庭长太太两只眼睛像两道火，接着说：“先生，人家随便跟你开个玩笑，你就用恶毒的侮辱来报复。谁相信那个德国人不是昏了头？他要不是你的帮凶，就是发了疯。你想教我们丢脸，要教我们坍台，那么好吧，邦斯先生，从今以后别再上这儿来教我们生气！”

邦斯变了一座石像，眼睛钉着地毯上的玫瑰花纹，绕着大拇指。

“怎么，你还不走，忘恩负义的恶棍！……”庭长太太转过身来嚷着，又指着邦斯对下人们说，“要是他敢再来，别让他进门。——约翰，你去请医生。——玛特兰纳，把鹿角精[1]找来！”

以庭长太太的想法，勃罗纳所说的理由只是借端推托，骨子里必定别有隐情；唯其如此，这亲事更没法挽回。女人在重大关头，主意总来得特别快，玛维尔太太马上觉得唯有说邦斯存心报复，才能补救这次的失败。这种思想，在邦斯看来固然是恶毒万分，为挽回家庭的面子却是再好没有。她根据自己对邦斯的宿恨，把普通女人的疑心肯定为事实。一般地说，女人总另有一套信仰，另有一种规律，凡是能满足她们的利益和情感的，都被认为千真万确之事。庭长夫人还更进一步，整个晚上把自己的信念灌输给丈夫，把他说服。下一天，法官也真的相信舅舅是罪大恶极了。读者一定觉得庭长夫人的行为令人发指，但在同样的情形之下，每个母亲都会学加缪索太太的样，宁可牺牲外人的名誉来保全自己的女儿的。手段尽可不同，目的始终不变。

老人很快地奔下楼梯；但一出门就脚步很慢地从大街上走到戏院，木偶似的进去，木偶似的跨上指挥台，木偶似的指挥乐队。休息时间，许模克看见邦斯对他的招呼都似理非理，不禁暗暗发急，以为邦斯疯了。对于天性像儿童一般的邦斯，刚才那一幕简直是滔天大祸……一片好心而招来那么深刻的仇恨，这不是世界翻了身吗？在庭长夫人的眼睛、举动、声调之间，他终于发现了一股势不两立的敌意。

到明天，加缪索太太下了一个大决心，这是事势所迫，而庭长也同意的。他们决定把玛维尔庄田，汉诺威街的住宅，连同十万法郎，一齐给赛西尔做陪嫁。庭长太太懂得，对这样一个挫折，只能拿一门现成的亲事来弥补。她早上便去拜访包比诺太太，把邦斯的毒计和可怕的报复讲了一遍。人家听到亲事的破裂是为了独养女儿的缘故，也觉得庭长太太的解释是可信的了。接着她把包比诺·特·玛维尔那样显赫的姓氏，数目惊人的陪嫁，说得非常动听。玛维尔庄田现有的收入是二厘利，不动产本身值到九十万；汉诺威街的住宅估计值二十五万。只要是懂事的家庭，决不会拒绝这样一门亲事的。所以包比诺夫妇就接受下来；然后，为了新亲家里的面子，他们答应对隔天的倒霉事儿帮着向外边解释。

在赛西尔的祖父老加缪索家里，还是原班人马，还是几天以前把勃罗纳捧上天的那位庭长夫人。虽然没有人敢向她开口，她可是勇气十足地出来解释道：

“真的，这年月一牵涉到亲事，简直防不胜防，尤其是跟外国人打交道。”

“为什么呢，太太？”

“你碰到了什么事啊？”希弗维尔太太问。

“你们不知道我们跟那个勃罗纳的事吗？他好大胆子，居然想向赛西尔求亲！……哪知他父亲在德国是个开小酒店的，舅舅是卖兔子皮的。”

“怎么会呢？像你这样精明的人！……”一位太太凑上来说。

“那些冒险家真狡猾！……可是我们从贝蒂哀那里全打听出来了。那德国人的好朋友是个吹笛子的穷光蛋！来往的有成衣匠，有在玛伊街开小客栈的……他自己吃着嫖赌，无所不为，已经把他娘的遗产败光了，再有天大的家私也不够他花……”

“你家小姐嫁了他可真要吃苦呢！……”贝蒂哀太太说。

“他又怎么被介绍到府上来的呢？”勒巴太太问。

“那是邦斯要找我们出气；他介绍那家伙来想丢我们的脸……勃罗纳，德文的意思是一口井，人家说得他像王爷一样，可是身体坏得可怜，头也秃了，牙齿也坏了；我看见他一次就起了疑心。”

“你说起的那笔好大的家私又是怎么回事呢？”一位年轻的太太怯生生地问。

“也并没像人家说的那么了不起。那些成衣匠，那个开旅馆的，倾其所有想办个银行……如今新开一个银行算得什么！不过预备倾家荡产罢了。做太太的今儿睡觉的时候有一百万，明儿醒过来只剩她自己的一份私房了。听他一开口，看他第一面，就不是个有身份的，我们对他就拿定了主意。他戴的手套，穿的背心，处处显出他是个工人，在德国开小酒店人家的儿子，谈不到什么高尚的心胸。他滥喝啤酒，滥抽烟……哎啊，太太！烟斗一天要抽二十五筒！跟了这样的男人，我可怜的丽丽还有日子过吗？……我现在想想还寒心呢。总算是上帝救了我们！再说，赛西尔也不喜欢他……你怎么想得到，一个亲戚，一个自己人，在我们家吃了二十年饭。每星期两次，得了我们多少好处，竟然捣这个鬼！邦斯也真会做戏，还当着司法部长、检察署长、首席庭长，承认赛西尔是他的继承人！……那勃罗纳和他串通了，这个说那个有几百万，那个说这个有几百万！……真的，我敢说，你们几位要是碰上了这种艺术家的诡计，一定也会上当的！”

几星期之内，包比诺与加缪索两家，和他们的党羽联合之下，毫不费劲地打了个大胜仗，因为谁也不替可怜的邦斯辩护。大家拿他看作吃白食的，又奸刁，又啬刻，又是假装的老实人，又是埋伏在旁人家里的毒蛇，极凶恶极危险的小丑，应当把他忘掉才好。

二十六、最后的打击


伪装的维特拒婚以后一个月光景，可怜的邦斯发了场神经性的高热病第一次起床，由许模克搀着，在太阳底下沿着大街溜达。修院大街上的人看到这一个满面病容，另一个小心扶持，谁也没有心肠笑两个榛子钳了。走到鱼市大街，邦斯呼吸着闹市的空气，脸上有了血色；肩摩踵接的地方，空气中的生命力特别强，所以罗马那个肮脏的犹太人区域连疟疾都是绝迹的。见到从前每天看惯的景象和巴黎街头的热闹，或许对病人也有影响。在多艺剧院对面，邦斯跟并肩走着的许模克分开了；他一路常常这样地走开去，瞧橱窗里新陈列的东西。这时他劈面遇见了包比诺，便恭恭敬敬地上前招呼，因为前任部长是邦斯最崇拜最敬重的一个人。

“嘿！先生，”包比诺声色俱厉地回答，“你有心糟蹋人家的名誉，丢人家的脸，想不到你还敢向那份人家的至亲来打招呼！那种报复的手段，只有你们艺术家才想得出……告诉你，先生，从今以后，我再不敢认得你了。伯爵夫人对你在玛维尔家的行为，也跟大家一样地深恶痛绝。”

前任部长走了，把邦斯丢在那里，像给雷劈了一样。情欲，法律，政治，一切支配社会的力量，打击人的时候从来不顾到对方的情形的。那位政治家，为了家庭的利益恨不得把邦斯压成齑粉，根本没有发觉这个可怕的敌人身体那么衰弱。

“怎么啦，可怜的朋友？”许模克的脸跟邦斯的一样白。

好人靠着许模克的肩膀回答说：“我心上又给人扎了一刀。现在我相信，只有上帝才有资格做好事，谁要去越俎代庖，就得受残酷的惩罚。”

他竭尽全身之力，才迸出这几句艺术家辛辣的讽刺。可怜这好心的家伙，看到朋友脸上的恐怖还想安慰他呢。

“我也这样想。”许模克简简单单回答了一句。

邦斯简直想不过来。赛西尔的结婚，加缪索和包比诺两家都没有请帖给他。走到意大利大街，邦斯看见加陶迎面而来。虽然去年还每隔半个月在他府上吃一顿饭，邦斯鉴于包比诺的训话，不敢再迎上前去，只向他行了个礼；可是那位区长兼国会议员，非但不还礼，反而怒气冲冲地瞪了邦斯一眼。

邦斯早已把倒霉事儿详详细细告诉过许模克；这时他吩咐许模克：“你去问问他，为什么他们都跟我过不去。”

“先生，”许模克走过去很婉转地对加陶说，“我的朋友邦斯才害了场病，也许你认不得他了？”

“当然认得。”

“那么你有什么事怪怨他呢？”

“你交的朋友是个忘恩负义的坏蛋，他那种人还能活着，那就像俗语说的，败草是拔不尽的。怪不得大家见了艺术家都要提防，他们又刁又恶，像猴子一样。你的朋友想扫他家族的面子，破坏一个姑娘的名誉，来报复一个无伤大雅的玩笑，我不愿意再跟他有什么关系；我但愿当初没有认识他，当作世界上根本没有这个人。先生，这不但是我的心理，而且我的家族，他的家族，所有赏他脸给他吃过饭的人都这样想……”

先生，你是一个明白人，可不可以让我把事情解释给你听……”

“你要有那个心肠，你去跟他做朋友吧，我管不着，”加陶回答，“可是别多说了。我告诉你，谁要替他开脱，替他辩护，我就认为跟他是一丘之貉。”

“连替他分辩一下都不行吗？”

“不行。他的行为是不齿于人的，所以是不容分辩的。”

把这两句自命为妙语的话说完了，塞纳州议员便扬长而去，不愿再听一个字。

许模克把那些恶毒的谩骂告诉了邦斯，邦斯苦笑道：“已经有两个官儿跟我作对了。”

“大家都跟我们作对，”许模克很痛心地接着说，“回家吧，免得再碰到那些畜生。”

谦恭了一辈子的许模克，这种话还是破题儿第一遭出口。他素来超然物外，荣辱不系于心，自己要临到什么患难，可能很天真地一笑置之；但看到高风亮节、韬光养晦的邦斯，以那种豁达的胸襟、慈悲的心肠而受人凌辱，他就不由得义愤填胸，把邦斯的居停主人叫作畜生了！在这个天性温和的人，他那种激动已经是大发雷霆，不下于洛朗的狂怒[1]。许模克恐防再遇到熟人，便搀着朋友往修院大街回头走；邦斯迷迷糊糊听凭他带路，似乎一个战士已经挣扎到筋疲力尽，也不在乎多挨几拳了。而可怜的音乐家，命中注定要受尽世界上的打击，落在他头上的冰雹包括了一切：有贵族院议员，有国会议员，有亲戚，有外人，有强者，有弱者，也有无辜的老实人。

在沿着鱼市大街回去的路上，对面来了加陶的女儿。这位年轻的妇女是经过患难而比较宽容的。她因为做了桩至今瞒着人的错事，不得不永远向丈夫低头。邦斯在招待他吃饭的那些人家，只有对贝蒂哀太太是称呼名字的，叫她“法丽西”，以为她有时还能了解他。那性情温和的太太当时一见到邦斯舅舅就有点儿发窘。虽然加陶是加缪索填房面上的亲戚，和邦斯毫无关系，但加陶家一向把他当作舅舅看待。法丽西·贝蒂哀没法躲开，只得在病人面前站住了：

“舅舅，我不相信你是坏人，可是人家说你的话，只要有四分之一是真的，那你的确虚伪透了……”她看见邦斯做了个手势，便抢着往下说，“噢！不用分辩！第一，我对谁都没有权利责备、批判，或是定什么罪名，因为我推己及人，知道理屈的人总有办法推诿；第二，你的申辩毫无用处。贝蒂哀先生——玛维尔小姐和包比诺子爵的婚约是他经手的——对你非常生气，要是知道我和你说过话，是我最后一个跟你攀谈，还会埋怨我呢。大家都对你很不好。”

“我亲眼看到了，太太！”可怜的音乐家声音异样地说着，恭恭敬敬向她行了个礼。

他费了好大的劲走回诺曼底街，靠在许模克肩上的重量，使德国人觉得他是硬撑在那里不让自己倒下来。跟这位太太的相遇，仿佛听到了睡在上帝脚下的羔羊的判决；而这是天上最后的判决，因为羔羊是可怜虫的天使，平民的象征。两个朋友一声不出地回到家里。人生有些情形，你只能觉得有个朋友在你身边；说出安慰的话只能刺痛创口，显出它的深度。在此你们可以看到，老钢琴家天生是个友谊的象征；无微不至的体贴，表示他像饱经忧患的人一样，知道怎样应付旁人的痛苦。

这次散步是邦斯老人最后的一次。他一场病没有完全好，又害了另一场病。本是多血质兼胆质的人，胆汁进到血里去了，他患着剧烈的肝脏炎。这是他一辈子仅有的两场病，所以他没有相熟的医生。忠心而懂事的西卜太太，开头是凭她的好意，甚至还带着点儿母性，把本区的医生给找了来。

二十七、从忧郁变为黄疸病


在巴黎，每个区域都有一个医生，他的姓名住址只有下等阶级、小布尔乔亚和门房知道，所以大家管他叫作本区医生。这种医生既管接生，也管放血，在医学界的地位等于分类广告上招聘或应征的打杂的用人。他人缘很好，因为对穷人不得不慈悲，靠老经验得来的本领也不能算坏。西卜太太陪着来的波冷医生，许模克一见面就认得了。他不大在意地听着老音乐家的诉苦，说身上痒得他整夜地搔，直搔到失去了知觉。眼睛的神气和四周那圈发黄的皮色，跟上述的征象恰好相符。

“这两天中间，你一定受了剧烈的刺激吧？”医生对病人说。

“唉！是啊。”

“你这是黄疸病，上回这先生也差点儿得这个病，”他指着许模克说，“可是没有关系。”波冷一边开处方一边补上一句。

医生嘴里说着安慰的话，对病人瞧着的眼光却是宣告死刑的判决，虽然他照例为了同情而隐藏着，真正关切病情的人还是能琢磨出来。西卜太太把那双间谍式的眼睛对医生瞅了一下，马上感觉到他敷衍的口气和虚假的表情，便跟着医生一起出去了。

“你认为这个病真的没有关系吗？”西卜太太在楼梯头上问医生。

“好太太，你那位先生是完了，倒并非为了胆汁进了血里去，而是为了他精神太不行。可是调养得好，还能把他救过来；应当教他出门，换个地方住……”

“哪儿来钱呢？……他的进款只有戏院里的薪水，他的朋友是靠几位好心的阔太太送的年金过日子的，也是个小数目，他说从前教过她们音乐。这是两个孩子，我招呼了九年啦。”

“我生平看得多了：好些病人都不是病死而是穷死的，那才是无可救药的致命伤。在多多少少的顶楼上，我非但不收诊费，还得在壁炉架上留下三五个法郎！……”

“哎唷，我的好先生！”西卜太太叫道，“街坊上有些守财奴，真是地狱里的魔鬼，倒有十万八万一年的进款；你要有了这么些钱，那真是上帝下凡了！”

波冷医生靠着区里诸位门房先生的好感，好容易有了相当的主顾给他混口苦饭吃；这时他举眼向天，对西卜太太扯了个答尔丢夫式的[1]鬼脸表示感谢。

“你说，波冷医生，要是好好地调养，咱们亲爱的病人还有救是不是？”

“对，只要精神上的痛苦别过分地伤害了他。”

“可怜的人！谁能给他受气呢？这样的好人，世界上除了他的朋友许模克，就找不出第二个！……我会打听出来究竟是怎么回事！哼，哪个把我的先生气成这样的，我一定去把他臭骂一顿……”

“你听着，好太太，”医生说着已经到了大门口，“你们这位先生的病有个特点，为些无聊的小事就会时时刻刻地不耐烦，他不见得会请看护，那么是你照顾他的了，所以……”

“你们是说邦斯先生吗？”那个卖旧铜铁器的咬着烟斗问。他说着从门槛上站起身子，加入看门女人和医生的谈话。

“是啊，雷蒙诺克老头！”西卜太太回答那奥弗涅人。

“哎，他可是比莫尼斯特洛，比那些玩古董的大佬都有钱呢……这一门我是内行，他有的是宝物！”

“哟！我还当作你说笑话呢，那天我趁两位先生不在家带你去看古董的时候。”西卜太太对雷蒙诺克说。

在巴黎，阶沿上有耳朵，门上有嘴巴，窗上有眼睛；最危险的莫过于在大门口讲话。彼此临走说的最后几句，好比信上的附笔，所泄露的秘密对听到的人跟说的人一样危险。只要举一个例子就可以使本书的情节更显得凿凿有据。

二十八、黄金梦


在帝政时代男人注意修饰头发的时候，有个最走红的理发匠，在一幢屋子里替一位漂亮太太梳完头走出来。那屋子里有钱的房客都是这理发匠的主顾，其中有位上了年纪的单身汉，雇的女管家恨死了主人的继承人。单身汉那时病得很重，才请了几位名医会诊，那时他们还没称为医学界之王。碰巧几位医生和理发匠同时出门。做戏似的会诊过后，拿到了事实，根据了医学，他们之间照例有番话说的。到了大门口快分手的时候，奥特里医生说：“这家伙必死无疑。”台北兰医生[1]回答道：“除非是奇迹，他活不到一个月了。”理发匠把这些话都听了去。跟所有的理发匠一样，他和下人们都是通声气的。一念之间起了贪心，他立刻回到楼上，答应给病人的女管家一笔很大的佣金，倘使她能说服主人把大部分的产业押作终身年金。病人五十六岁，实际还要老上一倍，因为过去太风流了。他产业中有所漂亮屋子坐落在黎塞留街，值到二十五万。理发匠看中这幢屋子，居然以三万法郎的终身年金[2]买了下来。这件事发生在一八〇六年。退休的理发匠现在年纪已经七十多，到一八四六年还在付那笔年金。单身汉已经九十六岁，老糊涂跟女管家结了婚，可见一时还不会死。理发匠给了女仆三万法郎；前前后后屋子花了他一百万以上，而今天的市价不过是八九十万。

学这个理发匠的样，奥弗涅人把勃罗纳相亲那天和邦斯在大门口说的话听了去，便想偷偷地进邦斯美术馆去瞧一眼。雷蒙诺克和西卜夫妇混得很好，所以两位先生一出门，马上被带进屋子。他看着那些宝物呆住了，觉得这倒是个发横财的机会。五六天以来，他只想着这个念头。

“我不是说着玩的，”他对西卜太太和波冷医生说，“咱们不妨仔细谈一谈，倘若他先生肯接受五万法郎终身年金，我可以送你一篮家乡的好酒，只要你……”

“真的吗？五万法郎的终身年金！……”医生对雷蒙诺克说，“要是老头儿这么有钱，有我给他医，有西卜太太给他看护，那他的病一定能好的……害肝病的人往往身体很强……”

“我说五万吗？哎，有位先生，就在这儿，在你门房外边的走道里，对他出过七十万，还光是为他的画呢，嗨嗨！”

听了雷蒙诺克这句话，西卜太太神气好古怪地望着波冷医生，她橘黄色的眼里射出一道魔鬼的凶光。

医生知道病人能够付诊费，不由得很高兴，嘴里却说着：“得了吧，别听那些废话。”

“噢，医生，既然先生躺在床上，只要西卜太太答应我把我的专家找来，保险要不了两个钟点，就能捧出七十万法郎……”

“得了吧，朋友，”医生说道，“喂，西卜太太，千万别跟病人闹别扭；你得非常忍耐，他对每样事都要生气，连你的好意也会教他不耐烦的；你得预备他怎么样都不如意……”

“那可不容易啰……”看门女人回答。

“你记着，”波冷拿出他医生的威严，“邦斯先生的命就操在招呼他的人手里；所以我每天要来，也许要来两次，早晨出诊先从这儿开始……”

医生从漠不关心——对穷苦病人的命运他一向是这样的——一变而为非常卖力非常殷勤，因为看那投机商人一本正经的态度，他觉得病人真的可能有笔财产。

“好，我一定把他服侍得像王上一样。”西卜太太装作很热心。

看门女人预备等医生拐进了夏洛街再跟雷蒙诺克谈话。卖旧货的背靠着铺子的门框，抽着最后几口烟。他那样站着并不是无心的，他等着看门女人。

铺面从前是开咖啡馆的，奥弗涅人租下来之后并没有改装。像现代的铺子一样，橱窗高头有块横的招牌，上面还看得见诺曼底咖啡馆几个字。奥弗涅人大概没有花什么钱，教一个漆匠的学徒在诺曼底咖啡馆下面空白的地方，漆上一行黑字：雷蒙诺克，买卖旧铜铁器，兼收旧货。不用说，那些玻璃杯、高脚凳、桌子、隔板，诺曼底咖啡馆所有的生财都给卖掉了。雷蒙诺克花了六百法郎，租下这个店面，连带一个后间、一个厨房和二层隔上一间卧房，以前是咖啡馆的领班睡的，因为咖啡馆主人住着另外一幢屋子。原有的体面装修，现在只剩下浅绿色的糊壁纸、橱窗外边的粗铁栏杆和插销了。

二十九、古董商的肖像


七月革命以后，雷蒙诺克在一八三一年到这儿来开始摆些破门铃、破盘子、废铜烂铁、旧天平、禁止使用的老秤。（政府定了法律推行新度量衡，他自己却把路易十六时代的一个铜子两个铜子的钱照旧流通。）这奥弗涅人是抵得上五个普通的奥弗涅人的，他第二步是收买厨房用具、旧框子、旧铜器和残缺不全的瓷器。买进卖出地过了些时候，不知不觉他铺子里的货跟尼古莱的滑稽戏一般，越来越像样了[1]。他用那个稳赢的赌博方法，连本带利地押上去，使有眼光的过路人，从铺子陈列的商品上看得出他经营的成绩。画框和铜器，慢慢地代替了白铁器、高脚油灯和破瓶破罐。接着又出现了瓷器。铺子变成卖旧画的，不久又变成了美术馆。忽然有一天，满是尘埃的玻璃窗擦得雪亮，屋子也给装修过，奥弗涅人竟脱下他的灯芯呢裤和短装，穿上大褂了！那模样好比一条龙保护着它的宝物。他周围摆着好东西，人也变得挺内行，把本钱加了十倍，把这一行的诀窍全学到了家，再不会上人家的当。这猛兽待在那儿，好似老鸨坐在一二十个年轻姑娘中间等主顾来挑。什么美，什么艺术的奇迹，他全不理会；他又狡猾又粗野，要赚多少钱都是早打算好的，遇到外行就狠狠地敲一笔。他学会了做戏，假装喜欢他的画，喜欢他嵌木细工的家具。他装穷，或是说收进的价钱多高，甚至拿出拍卖行的字条给你瞧。总之，他一忽儿这样，一忽儿那样，又装小丑又做傻子，简直无所不为。

从第三年起，雷蒙诺克颇有些可看的时钟、盔甲、古画。他要上街就教他的姊妹看着铺子，那是一个又胖又丑的女人，特意为了他从乡下步行来的。这个女的雷蒙诺克，目光迟钝像个白痴，穿扮得像日本瓷器上的神道，对兄弟告诉她的价钱连一个子儿都不肯让；并且她兼管家务，把不可能的事也变作可能，就是说他们俩差不多是靠塞纳河上的雾过日子的。姊弟两人只吃些面包、青鱼，还有从饭店扔在墙根的垃圾堆上捡来的蔬菜或老叶。连面包在内，两人花不了十二铜子一天，而女的雷蒙诺克还要靠缝衣或纺纱把这几个铜子挣回来。

初到巴黎的时候，雷蒙诺克只替人家跑腿，在一八二五至一八三一年之间，他给菩玛希大街上的古玩商和拉北街上的铜匠铺做掮客。他这段开场的历史便是一般古董商的历史。犹太人、诺曼底人、奥弗涅人、萨瓦人这四个民族[2]，本能相同，弄钱的方法也相同。一个小钱都不花，一个小钱都要挣，利上滚利地积聚：这些是他们的基本原则，而这些原则的确是不错的。

那时雷蒙诺克和他从前的东家莫尼斯特洛又讲和了，跟一些大商人做着买卖，专门到巴黎四乡去收货。诸位都知道，所谓巴黎的四乡是包括一百六十里周围的。干了十四年，他积下六万法郎财产和一个存货充足的铺子。贪图房租便宜，他待在诺曼底街，不捞额外的油水，光是跟同行做交易，只赚一些薄利。他跟人谈生意都是用的奥弗涅土话。他有个梦想，希望有朝一日，到大街上去开铺子，成为一个有钱的古董商，直接和收藏家打交道。的确，他骨子里是个很厉害的商人。因为每样事都亲自动手，脸上厚厚的一层积垢全是铜屑铁屑和着汗堆起来的；劳作的习惯，使他跟一七九九年代的老兵一样镇静，一样刻苦，所以他的表情更显得莫测高深。雷蒙诺克外表是个瘦小的男人；生得像猪眼似的小眼睛，配上冷冷的蓝颜色，表示他贪得无厌，奸刁阴狠，不下于犹太人。所不同的是，犹太人还要面上谦卑而暗中一肚子的瞧不起基督徒。

西卜夫妇对雷蒙诺克姊弟很帮忙。因为相信两个奥弗涅人真穷，所以西卜太太把许模克和西卜吃剩下来的东西卖给他们的时候，也就便宜得不像话。他们买一磅发硬的面包头和面包心子，只付两生丁半，一钵番薯只付一生丁半，诸如此类。狡猾的雷蒙诺克，从来不肯说他的买卖是为了自己做的。他老说代莫尼斯特洛经手，受一般大商人的剥削，所以西卜夫妻真心地可怜他。十一年如一日，奥弗涅人还穿着他的灯芯呢上装、灯芯呢裤和灯芯呢背心；而这三件衣服，奥弗涅最通行的服装，是由西卜不收工资，东拼西凑地维持在那里的。由此可见世界上的犹太人并不都在以色列。

“雷蒙诺克，你别跟我开玩笑，”西卜女人说，“难道邦斯先生有了那么大的家私，还这样过日子吗？他家里连一百法郎都没有！……”

“玩古董的全是这样的。”雷蒙诺克很简洁地回答。

“那么，你真的相信他有七十万了？……”

“七十万，光是他的画……特别有一张，只要他肯，我就是拼了命也想出五万法郎买下来呢。你知道挂肖像的地方，有些铺着红丝绒的、嵌珐琅的小铜框子吗？嗳，那是贝蒂多珐琅，有位药材商出身的部长出到三千法郎一个……”

“他一共有三十个呢。”门房的女人睁大了眼睛说。

“那他有多少财产，你去算吧！”

西卜太太一阵眼花，把身子转了半个圈子。她马上想要在邦斯老人的遗嘱上有个名字，学那些管家女仆的样；她们不是为了得到主人的年金，在玛莱区教多少人眼红的吗？她脑子里有幅图画，看到自己住在巴黎近郊一个小镇上，在一所乡下屋子里大摇大摆，养些鸡鸭，弄个菜园，教人家服侍得舒舒服服的，跟她心疼的西卜一块儿养老；他像所有被人遗忘、无人了解的天使一般，也应该享享福了。

一见看门女人这个突如其来的天真的动作，雷蒙诺克就知道事情有了把握。收旧货的行业（就是从外行的物主手里去买便宜货），最难的是走进人家的屋子。你真不知道他们为了要穿房入户想出多少玩意儿，那种狡猾、奸诈、哄骗，跟莫里哀剧中的坏用人不相上下，大有搬上舞台的资格。而那些活剧的动机，像这儿一样，永远是下人们的贪心。尤其在乡下或内地，仆人为了想捞进三十法郎的现款或东西，会让收旧货的做成净赚一二千法郎的交易。有些塞夫勒古窑的餐具，要是把收进的故事讲给你听，你会觉得奈梅亨、乌得勒支、赖斯韦克[3]、维也纳，那些国际会议上发挥的权术和聪明才智，还不及收旧货的商人，他们的可笑要比外交家的来得朴实。收旧货的手段，和外交使节为破坏别国邦交而苦思得来的计策，以挖掘人性而论是同样的深刻。

“西卜女人给我说得心眼儿都痒了，”雷蒙诺克对他的姊妹说，她正在坐上她坐惯的那张要散架似的破椅子，“现在我要去请教一个独一无二的内行，那个犹太人，只收咱们分半利的好犹太人！”

雷蒙诺克把西卜女人的心看透了。这种性格的妇女，一有欲望就得行动；她们只问目的，不择手段，能从一丝不苟的诚实一刹那间变成无恶不作。诚实，像我们所有的情操一样，应当分成消极的与积极的两类。消极的诚实便是西卜女人那一种，在没有发财的机会时，她是诚实的。积极的诚实是每天受着诱惑而毫不动心的，例如收账员的诚实。

三十、西卜女人的第一次攻势


卖旧货的那番恶魔式的话，仿佛打开了水闸，把一大堆坏念头灌进了看门女人的头脑和心里。从门房到她两位先生的屋子，她不是奔了去，而是飞过去的；邦斯和许模克正在那儿长吁短叹，她便装得满脸同情地跨进门。许模克看见打杂的女人来了，赶紧递个眼色，教她别把医生的实话当着病人说；因为这朋友，这了不起的德国人，也看出了医生眼中的意思；她也递个眼色回答，表示很难过。

“喂，好先生，你觉得怎么样？”西卜女人问。

她站在床跟前，把拳头叉在腰里，不胜怜爱地瞅着病人，可是她眼中射出多少金星！在旁观的人看来，那就和老虎眼睛一样可怕。

“不行哪，”可怜的邦斯回答，“我一点儿胃口都没有了。”——他又紧紧握着许模克的手嚷道：“噢！那些人！”许模克坐在床前抓着邦斯的手，大概邦斯正和他谈着致病的原因。——“亲爱的许模克，我早听了你的话就好啦！从我们同住之后，就该和你一起在这儿吃饭！别再跟那些人来往！他们像一车石头压一个鸡子似的把我压得粉碎，不知道为什么！……”

“得啦，得啦，好先生，别诉苦啦，”西卜女人说，“医生告诉了我真话……”

许模克扯了扯看门女人的衣角。

“哎！他说你这一关是挨得过的，可是非要招呼得好……放心，你身边有这样一个好朋友，再加上我，不是我夸口，准会把你招呼得像母亲招呼第一个孩子一样。从前西卜害过一场病，波冷医生说他完了，像俗语说的，已经把尸衣扔在他头上了，当作死人看待了，结果我还把他救了过来！……你现在虽是病势不轻，可是谢谢上帝！还没到西卜那个田地……单凭我一个人，就能教你挨过这一关！放心吧，可是你别这样地乱动呀。”

她把被子拉上，盖住病人的手。

“你瞧吧，小乖乖，夜里我跟许模克先生陪你，坐在你床边……包你比王爷还要给侍候得周到……再说，你又不是没有钱，为了治病，尽可以要什么有什么……我才跟西卜讲妥了；哎啊，那可怜的人，没有了我就不知怎办呢！……可是我把他开导明白了，你知道，我们俩都那么喜欢你，所以他答应我到这儿来陪夜……像他这样的男人，真是大大的牺牲哪！因为他对我的爱情还跟第一天一样。不知道他怎么的，大概在门房里咱们成天守在一起的缘故吧！……哎，你别把被子推开呀！……”她奔到床头把被单拉到邦斯胸口。“你看波冷医生好得像上帝一样，你要不听他的吩咐，要不是乖乖的，那我就不管啦……你得听我的话……”

“是的，西卜太太，他一定听话，”许模克回答，“我知道，为了他的好朋友许模克，他要活下去的。”

“最要紧是不能烦躁，”西卜女人接着说，“便是你自己不闹脾气，这个病也要惹动你的肝火。好先生，我们害病都是上帝的意思，都是他惩罚我们的罪孽，你总该有些对不起人的事吧？……”

病人摇摇头。

“得了吧，你年轻的时候爱过女人，有过荒唐事儿，也许有些爱情的果子丢在外边，没有吃没有住的……哼，没良心的男人！爱的时候打得火热，过后就完啦，再也想不起啦，把小孩子奶妈的月费都忘了！……可怜的女人！……”

“唉，我哪，一辈子只有许模克和可怜的母亲爱我。”邦斯很伤心地回答。

“唉！你又不是圣人！你当初也年轻过来，二十岁的时候一定是个漂亮哥儿……人又这样好，连我也会喜欢你呢……”

“我一向就像癞蛤蟆一样的丑！”邦斯给她缠得没了办法。

“你这是谦虚，谦虚就是你的好处。”

“不，不，好西卜太太，真的，我生来就丑的，从来没有人爱过我……”

“嗬！你没有人爱？……到这个年纪，你想教我相信你当初是个贞节的小姑娘……这个话你去对别人说吧！一个音乐家！又是在戏院里混的！哪怕一个女人对我这么说，我也不信。”

“西卜太太，你要惹他生气了！”许模克叫着，他看见邦斯像条虫似的在床上扭来扭去。

“你，你也免开尊口！你们俩都是老风流……生得再丑也不相干，俗语说得好，没有一个丑男人娶不到媳妇的！连西卜也会教巴黎最漂亮的牡蛎美人爱上他，还用说你吗？你比他强多了……你心地又好！……得啦，你是荒唐过的！上帝就是责罚你丢掉了你的孩子，像亚伯拉罕一样[1]！……”

病人疲乏已极，可是还挣扎着做了个否认的姿势。

“放心好啦，你尽管丢掉了你的孩子，还是能像玛土撒拉一样长寿的[2]。”

“别胡闹了！”邦斯叫起来，“我从来不知道什么叫作被人爱！从来没有什么孩子，世界上只有我一个人……”

“噢！真的吗？……因为你心肠这样好，那是女人最喜欢的，她们舍不得男人就为这个……所以我觉得你年轻的时候不会没有……”

“把她带出去！她把我烦死了！”邦斯凑着许模克的耳朵说。

“那么许模克先生，你是有孩子的了……你们这般单身的老头儿，都是一路的货……”

“我吗！……那……”许模克猛地站了起来。

“好吧，你，你也没有继承人是不是？你们两个在世界上就像那些自生自发的菌……”

“喂，你来！”许模克回答。

忠厚的德国人使劲拿西卜太太拦腰一把，不管她怎么叫喊，拖着她往客厅里走。

三十一、贞节的表现


“你活了这把年纪，还想糟蹋一个可怜的女人吗？”西卜女人在许模克怀里挣扎着叫道。

“别嚷！”

“两个人中间还算你好呢，你竟这样！唉！你们这些老头儿从来没尝过女人的滋味，真不该对你们提到爱情什么的！”西卜女人看见许模克气得眼睛发亮，便又嚷着，“我挑起了你的心火啦，你这个禽兽！救命呀！救命呀！我给人抢走啦！”

“你这个傻瓜！告诉我，医生怎么说来着？……”德国人把她松了手。

“想不到你对我这样凶，”西卜女人哭着说，“我倒是水里火里为你们俩拼命呢！哎啊！人家说日久见人心……真是一点不错，西卜就不会这样虐待我……我还把你们当作孩子看待呢。因为我没有孩子。昨天，对啦，就不过是昨天，我对西卜说，‘朋友，上帝不给我们孩子，他可是肚里有数的，因为楼上两位就是我的孩子呀！’——你瞧，我凭着基督的十字架起誓，凭我母亲的灵魂起誓，我的的确确对他这么说……”

“嗨！医生说些什么呀？”许模克问，他气得生平第一次跺脚了。

“你听着，”西卜太太把许模克拉到饭厅里，“他说，我们这个亲爱的小心肝小宝贝的病人，性命靠不住，要是不好好地看护；可是你瞧，我还是待在这里，尽管你那样凶。是的，你好凶哦，我一向把你当作那么和气呢。真！你这种脾气！……你这个年纪还想调戏女人吗，老浑蛋？……”

“我？浑蛋？……难道你不明白我只喜欢邦斯吗？”

“那才好啦，那么你不跟我胡闹了吧？”她对许模克微微笑着，“你还是老实一点的好，告诉你，谁要抹西卜的面子，西卜会打断他的腿的！”

“你好好地招呼邦斯吧，西卜太太。”许模克说着，想握她的手。

“怎么！又来啦？”

“你听我呀！我把所有的东西都送给你，只要能救他的命……”

“好吧，我要上药房买药去了……先生，你知道这个病要花多少钱哦！你怎么办呢？……”

“我可以拼命去做事！我要邦斯给伺候得像王爷一样……”

“你交给我得啦，许模克先生，甭操心啦。我跟西卜有两千法郎积蓄，你们拿去用就是了，嗨！我在这儿垫款已经垫了好久了……”

“好太太！”许模克抹了抹眼泪，“你心肠多好！”

“你的眼泪就是我的报酬！”西卜女人做戏似的说，“因为我是世界上最没有贪心的人；可是你不能湿着眼睛走进去，邦斯先生会疑心他病重的。”

许模克被这番体贴感动了，抓着西卜女人的手握了一握。

“别动手动脚啊！”过时的牡蛎美人对许模克抛了一个媚眼。

忠厚的德国人回进屋子说：“邦斯，西卜太太真是个天使，说话太多一点，可的确是个天使。”

“真的？……我从一月到现在变得多心了，”病人侧了侧脑袋回答，“吃了那些亏，我对谁都不信了，除了上帝跟你！……”

“快点儿好吧，咱们三个人可以把日子过得挺舒服的！”许模克嚷着。

看门女人上气不接下气地奔进门房，叫道：“西卜，喂！朋友，咱们的家私跑不掉了。我那两位先生没有继承人，也没有私生子，也没有……什么也没有，嗨嗨！……我要去教封丹太太起个课，瞧瞧咱们能有多少年金！……”

“我的女人呀，”矮小的裁缝回答说，“别光着脚等死人的鞋子穿。”

“哦！你来教训我吗，你？”她在西卜肩上亲热地拍了一下。“我肚里明白得很。波冷医生说的，邦斯先生是完了！咱们好发财啦！遗嘱上准有我的名字……包在我身上！你缝你的衣服，好好照顾着门房，嗳，你快不用干这个活啦！咱们到乡下去养老，譬如说巴底涅吧。弄所好屋子，有个小花园，你种种花玩儿，我吗，我要雇个老妈子！……”

“哎，喂！好嫂子，楼上怎么啦？”雷蒙诺克问，“那个收藏值多少，你知道了没有？”

“不，不，还早呢！好家伙，做事不能这么急。我呀，我先把更要紧的事儿打听出来了！……”

“更要紧的？”雷蒙诺克嚷着，“除了他的东西，还有什么更要紧的？”

“得了吧，你这小子！让我来把舵。”门房女人老气横秋地回答。

“七十万抽三成，你就一辈子吃着不尽了！……”

“别急，雷蒙诺克；赶到要知道老头儿藏的东西值多少钱的时候，咱们再谈……”





三十二、论占卜星相之学


她上药房去配了波冷医生的方子，决意等明天再去找封丹太太。因为那边常常挤满了人，西卜女人觉得清早去，赶在大众之前，女巫神志一定更清楚，说的话也更明白。

封丹太太是玛莱区的女巫，跟有名的勒诺芒小姐[1]竞争了四十年，结果比她还活得久。起课卜卦的女人和巴黎下等阶级的关系，愚夫愚妇要决定什么的时候受到她们多少影响，大家是想象不到的。厨娘，看门女人，人家的外室，男女工人，凡是在巴黎靠希望过日子的都要去请教那些女巫；她们生来有种不可思议的、没有人解释过的神通，能够预卜休咎。学者，律师，公证人，医生，法官，哲学家，都不会想到巫术信仰普遍的程度。平民自有一些历久不灭的本能，其中有一项大家妄称为迷信的本能，不但在平民的血里有，便是优秀人士的头脑里也有。在巴黎，找人起课卜卦的政治家就不在少数。在不信的人看来，占卜星相无非利用我们的好奇心，因为好奇心是特别强的天性。他们绝对否认，占卜范围内七八种主要方法所显示的图谶跟人的命运有什么关系。头脑坚强的人或唯物主义的哲学家，只信有形的具体的事实，从蒸馏瓶或是靠现代物理学化学的天平得来的结果；可是他们的排斥占卜，等于他们排斥多少自然现象一样劳而无功，占卜术照旧存在，照旧传布，只是没有了进步，因为两百年来，优秀人士都不去研究它了。

一个人把一副纸牌洗过，分过，再由卜卦的人根据某些神秘的规则分成几堆，就能从牌上知道这个人过去的事，只有他一人知道的秘密：单从表面看，你去相信这种事是荒谬的。可是蒸汽、火药、印刷、眼镜、铜版镂刻等等的发明，以及最近的银版摄影[2]，都被定过荒谬的罪名，而航空至今还被认为荒谬。要是有人告诉拿破仑，说一座建筑，一个人，一切物体，在空气中永远有个形象，可以捉摸到，感觉到；这个人一定给送进夏朗东疯人院，像从前黎塞留把贡献汽船计划的沙洛蒙送入皮赛德疯人院一样[3]。可是这理论便是达盖尔的发明所证实的！某些目光犀利的人，觉得每个人的命运都给上帝印在他的相貌上；倘若把相貌当作全身的缩影，那么为什么手不能做相貌的缩影呢？手不是代表人的全部活动，而人的活动不是全靠手表现的吗？这就是手相学的出发点。社会不是模仿上帝的吗？我们看到一个兵就预言他会打仗，看到一个律师预言他会说话，看到一个鞋匠说他会做鞋子靴子，看到一个农夫说他会锄田加肥料；那么一个有先知能力的人，看了人的手预言他的将来，还不是一样的平淡无奇？举例来说，天才是一望而知的，哪怕最无知识的人在巴黎街上散步，瞧见一个大艺术家也会猜到他是大艺术家。那好比一个太阳，到哪儿都放光。一个呆子给你的印象，恰好跟天才的相反，所以你也能立刻认出他是个呆子。一个平常人走过，差不多是无人发觉的。多半的社会观察家，尤其是研究巴黎社会的，碰到一个过路人就能说出他的职业。从前关于萨巴的故事，说撒旦召集夜会，叫人间的信徒去参加等等，十六世纪的画家常常作为题材，到今日已不成其为神秘了。源出印度而古时称为埃及人，现在称为波希米亚人的那个流浪民族[4]，其实只是给顾客吃了一种叫作赫希煦的麻醉品，令人精神恍惚，自以为去赴撒旦的夜会，又是骑了扫帚柄当马呀，又是从烟囱里飞出去呀，还有所谓目睹的幻象，什么老婆子变成少妇，什么跳着疯狂的舞，听着奇妙的音乐等等。以前指为魔鬼的信徒做的一切荒诞不经的怪事，实际全是吃了麻醉品的幻梦。

今日多少千真万确的事，都是从古代的占星学中发展出来的，所以将来必有一日，那些学问会像化学天文学一样成为学校的课程。巴黎最近设立斯拉夫文讲座、满洲文讲座，其实它们和北欧文学一样，只配受人家的教育，还没有资格去教育别人，而那些讲师也只搬弄些关于莎士比亚或十六世纪的陈词滥调。可怪的是，人们一方面添加这些无用的科目，同时却并没在人类学项下，把古代大学教得最精彩的占星学加以恢复。在这一点上，那个如是伟大而又如是孩子气的德国，倒是法国的先进，因为他们已经在教那门学问了，它不是比实际上大同小异的各派哲学有用得多吗？

既然俗眼看不见的自然现象，一个大发明家能看出它有成为一种工业一门学问的可能，那么某些人能从胚胎阶段的“原因”中去看出将来的“后果”，也没有什么离情悖理，值得大惊小怪的。那不过是大家公认的某种官能所起的作用，一种精神的梦游。许多推测未来的方法，都可用这个假定作根据；尽管你说这个假定是荒谬的，可是事实俱在。你可以注意到，预言家推测未来并不比断言过去更费事；而在不相信的人说来，过去与未来同样是不可知的。假使既成事实有遗迹可寻，那就不难想到未来之事必有根苗可见。只要一个算命的能把只有你一人知道的以往的事实，详细说给你听，他就能把现有的原因在将来发生的后果告诉你。精神的世界可以说是从自然界脱胎而来的，一切因果作用也是相同的，除了因环境各异而有所区别之外。物体在空气中的的确确投射一个影子，可以用银版摄影把它在半路上捕捉得来；同样，思想也是真实而活跃的东西，它在精神世界的空气中（我们只能如此说）也发生作用，也有它的影子，所以有奇异禀赋的人就能窥到这些形象，或者说窥到这些思想的迹象。

至于占卜所用的方法，只要那借来预卜吉凶休咎的物体，例如纸牌，是由问卜的人亲自调动过的，那便是奇妙的程序中最容易解释的部分了。在现实世界上，一切都是相连的。一切动作都有一个原因，一切原因都牵涉到全体；所以一个最细微的动作也代表着全体。近代最伟大的人物拉伯雷，差不多集毕达哥拉斯、希波克拉底、亚里士多德、但丁之大成，在三百年前说过：“人是一个小天地。”三百年之后，瑞典的先知斯威顿堡又说地球是一个人。可见先知与怀疑派的远祖在人生最大的公式上是一致的。地球本身的活动是命定的，人生的一切也是命定的。所有的事故，哪怕是最琐细的，都隶属于整个的命运。所以，大事情，大计划，大思想，必然反映在最小的行动上面，而且反映得极其忠实。譬如说，一个阴谋叛乱的人，倘使把一副牌洗过，分过，就会在牌上留下他阴谋的秘密，逃不过占卜的人的眼睛，不管你把占卜的人叫作波希米亚人，或是算命的，或是走江湖的，或是别的什么。只要你承认有宿命，就是说承认一切原因的连锁，那么就有占卜星相之学存在，而成为像过去那样的一门大学问，因为其中包括着使居维叶成为伟大的演绎法；可是在占卜上，演绎法的运用是挺自然的，不像那位天才的生物学家需要埋首书斋，深夜苦思才能运用。

占卜星相流行了七世纪，它的影响不像现代这样限于平民阶级，而是普及于帝王、后妃、有钱的人和聪明才智之士。古代最大的学问之一动物磁气（现在叫作催眠学），便是从占卜星相的学问中蜕变出来的，正如化学的脱胎于炼丹术。新兴的头盖学、人相学、神经学，也渊源于占卜星相之学。首倡这些新学问的名人，和所有的发明家一样只犯了一桩错误，就是根据零星的事实造成一个严格的理论体系，其实我们还不能从那些零星的事实中分析出一个概括的原因。互相水火的加特力教会与近代哲学，居然也有一天会一致和司法当局表示同意，把降神术的神秘和相信降神术的人士说作荒谬绝伦而加以禁止，加以迫害，使占卜星相之学一百年间无人研究。可是无知的平民，不少的知识分子，尤其是妇女，对于能知过去未来的术士继续在那里捐输纳款，向他们买希望，买勇气，买只有宗教能够给他们的一切精神力量。可见占卜星相之术永远在冒着危险流行，从十八世纪百科全书派学者提倡宽容之后，今日巫祝已不受酷刑的威胁；只有在敛人财帛，构成诈欺罪的时候才被送上轻罪法庭。不幸，诈欺行为往往跟这个通灵妙术分不开。原因是这样的：

巫祝所有的那些奇能异禀，通常只发现在我们所谓愚夫愚妇的身上。愚夫愚妇倒是上帝的选民，获有惊世骇俗的真传秘箓。圣彼得与埃弥德一流的人都是愚夫愚妇出身。只要精神保持完整，不在高谈阔论、钩心斗角、著书立说、研究学问、治国治民、发明创造、驰骋疆场等等上面消耗，它就能吐出非常强烈的潜伏的火焰，好像一块未经琢磨的钻石保存着所有的光彩。一有机会，这一点灵性就会突然爆发，有飞越空间的巨翼，有洞烛一切的慧眼：昨天还是一块煤，明天被一道无名的液体浸润过后，立刻成为毫光万道的钻石了。有知识的人把聪明在各方面用尽了，除了上帝偶然要显示奇迹之外，永远表现不出这种卓绝的能力。所以占卜看相的男男女女，几乎老是浑浑噩噩的乞丐，村野粗鲁，在苦难的波涛中，在人生的沟壑中打滚的石子，除了肉体受苦之外别无消耗。总之，所谓先知，所谓预言家，就是农夫马丁，对路易十八说出一桩唯有王上自己知道的秘密而使他大吃一惊的[5]；也就是勒诺芒小姐，或是像封丹太太般当厨娘的，或是一个近于痴呆的黑姑娘，或是一个与牛羊为伴的牧人，或是一个印度的托钵僧，坐在庙门口苦修，炼到神完气足，能够像梦游病人那样神通广大。

古往今来，这一类的异人多半出在亚洲。平时他们与常人无异；因为他们也要尽其物理的化学的功能，可是像传电的良导体一般，有时只是冥顽不灵的物质，有时却成为输送神秘电流的河床。这些人一恢复正常状态，就想为非作歹，结果把他们带上轻罪法庭，甚至像有名的巴太查一样给送进苦役监。卜卦起课对平民有多大的影响，还有一个证明，便是可怜的音乐家的生死，全看西卜太太教封丹太太占卜的结果而定。

虽然作者写的十九世纪法国社会史，篇幅浩繁，情节复杂，某些段落的重复无法避免，但封丹太太所住的魔窟，已经在《莫名其妙的喜剧家》[6]中描写过，在此可以毋庸赘述。我们只要知道，西卜太太走进老修院街封丹太太家的神气，活像英国咖啡馆的熟客走进这饭店去吃饭。她是女巫多年的主顾，常常介绍一些好奇的少妇或多嘴的老婆子去的。

三十三、大课[1]


替女巫当执事的老妈子，不先通报，就打开仙坛的门对主人说：“西卜太太来了！……”她又回头招呼：“请进来吧，没有人呢。”

“哦，孩子，你这么早赶来有什么事啊？”老妖婆问。

七十八岁的封丹太太，活像地狱里执掌生死大权的巴克女神，够得上称为妖婆了。

“我心里七上八下的，想请你起个大课，看看我的财运。”西卜太太叫着。

于是她把情形讲了一遍，要求对她居心不良的希望给个预言。

“你不知道起大课是怎么回事吗？”封丹太太一本正经地问。

“不，我没有那么多钱来见识这个玩意儿！……一百法郎！唉！我哪儿来一百法郎呢？可是今儿我非来一下不可！”

“大课我也不大起的，”封丹太太说，“只替那般有钱的人有大事的时候才干一回，他们给我五百法郎呢；因为你知道，那是怪费力怪累的！仙人教我抽肠刮肚地受罪，像从前人说的参加了萨巴一样！”

“可是我告诉你，封丹太太，这一下是有关我前程的……”

“好吧，承你介绍了许多主顾；我就为你上仙一次吧。”封丹太太的干瘪脸上有些恐怖的表情，倒绝对不是假装的。

她从壁炉旁边一张又旧又脏的大靠椅上站起来，走向桌子。桌上铺着绿呢，经纬都可以数得清；左边睡着一只奇大无比的蛤蟆，旁边摆一个打开着的笼，里头有只毛羽蓬松的黑母鸡。

“阿斯太洛！来，小东西，”她拿一支编织用的长针在蛤蟆背上轻轻敲了一下，它望着她，仿佛很懂事的样子，“还有你，克莱奥巴特拉小姐！……留点儿神哪！”她把母鸡的嘴巴也用针尖敲了敲。

封丹太太凝神屏息，半晌不动，神气像死人，眼睛发了白，在那里骨碌碌地乱转；然后她把身子一挺，嗄着嗓子说了声：“我来了！”

她像木头人似的把粟子撒在母鸡前面，拿起牌来哆哆嗦嗦地洗过了，深深地叹了口气，叫西卜太太分做两堆。

这个死神转世的老婆子，戴着条油腻的头巾，披着件怕人的短袄；瞧着母鸡啄食粟子，又唤她的蛤蟆在摊开的牌上爬：西卜太太看着这些，不由得身子凉了半截。

只有坚定的信仰才能教人心惊胆战。发财还是不发财，这是个问题，像莎士比亚说的[2]。

老妖婆打开一本符咒的书，嗄着嗓子念了一段，把剩下来的粟子和蛤蟆回去的路线打量了一番，瞪着白眼细细推详牌上的意义。这些动作一共花了七八分钟，然后她说：

“你会成功的，虽然这桩事并不像你所想的那么发展。你得大大地忙一阵，可是你的心血不会白费。你要做些很坏的事，像那些在病人身边谋遗产的人一样。这件坏事里头，你有好些贵人相助！……将来你受临终苦难的时候要后悔……因为你要给两个苦役监的逃犯谋财害命，一个是红头发的小个子，一个是秃顶的老人，他们相信你有钱，在你跟第二个丈夫住的那个小村子上……得啦，孩子，干不干随你吧。”

表面上冷冰冰的骷髅似的老婆子，内里却是精神奋发，深陷的眼睛有如两个火把。预言完了，那点精神也跟着消灭了。封丹太太好似一阵头晕，像患梦游病的给人惊醒了过来，很诧异地向四下里瞧了瞧，然后认出了西卜太太，看见她面无人色觉得很奇怪。

三十四、一个霍夫曼传奇中的人物


“怎么样，孩子？你满意吗？……”她的声音和预言的声音完全不同。

西卜太太眼睛直勾勾地瞪着老妖婆，一句话都说不上来。

“哎！你不是要起大课吗？我是把你当熟人看待的。只收你一百法郎吧……”

“西卜会死？……”门房女人叫着。

“难道我告诉了你很可怕的事吗？……”封丹太太问话的口气非常天真。

“可不是！……”西卜女人从袋里掏出一百法郎放在桌子边上，“要给人谋杀！……”

“哦！只怪你自己要起大课！……可是放心，牌上说要给人谋杀的，不是每一个都应验的。”

“封丹太太，到底可能不可能？”

“哎啊！我的小乖乖，那我怎么知道呢？你要去敲未来的门，我就替你拉了铃，他就来了！”

“他，他是谁？”西卜太太问。

“仙人呀，不是仙人是谁？”老妖婆表示不耐烦了。

“再会，封丹太太！我没见过起大课，你真把我吓坏了，你！……”

老妈子把看门女人送到楼梯口，说道：“太太一个月也不起两回大课的！过后她真累死了。她要吃好几块猪排，睡三个钟点……”

走在街上，西卜太太像一个人随便跟人家商量什么以后的心理，把预言中对自己有利的部分都信以为真，把所说的灾难都认为不可能。第二天，主意更坚决了，她想大举进攻，把邦斯美术馆的东西弄上一部分，发一笔财。她几天之内只盘算着怎样把各种方法配合起来，达到她的目的。上面说过，粗人从来不像上等人那样随时随地消耗智力，所以他们执着一念的时候，精神上仿佛添了武器，力量格外的强。这些现象，在西卜女人身上表现得特别显著。执着一念的囚犯能够造成越狱的奇迹，平常人执着一念能够产生感情上的奇迹。这个看门女人的贪心，也使她变得像纽沁根受困之下一样强悍，面上愚蠢而实际和拉·巴番里纳一样精明。

几天之后早上七点光景，雷蒙诺克正在开铺门，她就眉开眼笑地走过去问：

“堆在我先生家里的东西，怎么样才能知道一个确实的价钱呢？”

“那容易得很。倘使你跟我公平交易，我可以介绍你一个估价的人，挺老实的，他能知道那些画的价值，差不了一两个铜子……”

“谁？”

“一个叫作玛古斯的犹太人，他现在做买卖不过是玩玩罢了。”

埃里·玛古斯在《人间喜剧》中已是老角色，可以无须介绍[1]；只要知道他那时已不做古画古玩的买卖，而是以商人资格采取了收藏家邦斯的办法。以估价出名的人，例如已故的亨利，在世的比育、莫莱、丹莱、乔治洛恩，以及美术馆的专家等等，跟玛古斯一比简直都是小孩子。他对百年尘封的古画能辨别出是否杰作，他认得所有的画派和所有画家的笔迹。

这个从波尔多搬到巴黎来的犹太人，一八三五年起就不做买卖，但依旧穿得破破烂烂，因为这是多数犹太人的习惯，而犹太人是最守传统的民族。中世纪各国对犹太人的迫害，使他们为了避人注目故意穿得衣衫褴褛，老是哭丧着脸，装穷叹苦。习惯成自然，当年出于不得已的行为，慢慢地成为民族的本能和习惯了。玛古斯从前买卖钻石、古画、花边、珐琅、高等古玩、细巧的雕刻、古时的金银器物，靠这一行规模越来越大的生意，暗暗地挣了一份很大的财产。的确，巴黎是世界上古玩珍宝荟萃之地，近二十年古董商的人数加多了十倍。至于画，只有在罗马、伦敦、巴黎三大城市才有交易。

玛古斯住在通往王家广场的一条宽而短的弥尼末街，那儿他有所古老的宅子，在一八三一年上买进的，价钱简直便宜得不像话。屋子当初是有名的审计官摩朗古盖的，其中有路易十五时代装修得最华丽的几间房，大革命时因地位关系并没受到损坏。老犹太人违反民族的习惯而置产是有他的理由的。他晚年也跟我们老来一样染上一种近乎疯狂的嗜好。虽然和他故世的老朋友高勃萨克同样吝啬，他却不知不觉地对手里进出的宝物着了迷。但像他那种眼光越来越高、条件越来越苛的癖，只有国王才够得上资格有，还得是个有钱有鉴赏力的国王。据说普鲁士的第二个王[2]挑选掷弹兵，要身高六英尺才合意，那时他会不惜重金罗致，放进他的掷弹兵博物馆；同样，那位退休的古董商看得中的画，既要没有一点毛病，又要没有经过后人修补，还得是那个画家最精的作品。所以逢到大拍卖，他从不缺席，他巡阅所有的市场，跑遍整个的欧洲。这颗唯利是图的心像冰山一般的冷，看见一件精品可马上会热起来，正如玩腻了女人的老色鬼，到处寻访绝色的美女，一朝碰见完美的姑娘就不由得神魂颠倒。他崇拜理想的美，对艺术品的疯魔好比唐·璜对女人，从欣赏中体味到比守财奴瞧着黄金更高级的乐趣。他置身于名画中左顾右盼，俨如苏丹进了后宫。

存放那些宝物的地方，不下于王爷的儿女们住的。玛古斯把整个二楼装修得美轮美奂地养它们。窗上挂着威尼斯的金线铺绣做窗帘。地下铺着萨伏伊最漂亮的地毯。一百幅左右的画上富丽堂皇的框子，全部由赛尔威很古雅地重新描过金。玛古斯认为他是巴黎唯一认真的描金匠，亲自教他用英国金描漆，因为英国金的质地比法国的好得多。描金业中的赛尔威，正如装订业中的多佛南，是个爱好自己作品的艺术家。屋内所有的窗都钉着铁皮的护窗板。玛古斯自己在三层顶楼上住着两间房，里面全是些破家具破衣服，一望而知是犹太人住的地方，因为他到老也没改变他的生活方式。

底层到处摆着犹太人还在买进卖出的画和从国外运来的箱子；另有一间极大的画室，现代修补古画最好的一个艺术家，应该由美术馆聘请的名手，莫莱，差不多给玛古斯长期包着在这儿工作。女儿诺爱弥的房间也在楼下。她是犹太人晚年生的，长得秀美，就像亚洲种族的特征表现得特别纯粹、特别高雅的那种犹太女子。和她做伴的是两个顽固的犹太老妈子，还有一个叫作阿勃朗谷的波兰犹太人做前哨。他不知怎么阴差阳错地，牵入了波兰的革命运动，玛古斯有心利用，把他救了出来派做门房。阿勃朗谷守着这所又静又阴气又荒凉的屋子，住着一间门房，带了三条凶猛无比的狗，一条是纽芬兰种，一条是比莱南种，一条是英国种的斗牛狗。

这样，犹太人可以放心大胆地出门旅行，可以高枕无忧地睡觉，既不用怕人家来夺他的第一件宝贝，女儿，也不必为他的画跟黄金操心。他这种安全是根据极深刻的世故得来的。第一，阿勃朗谷的工资每年加二百法郎，可是主人故世之后再没有什么遗赠的了；同时玛古斯又把他教会了在街坊上放印子钱。有人来的时候，阿勃朗谷要不先从装着粗铁杆的门洞里张望一下，决不开门。这个大力士般的门房爱戴玛古斯，仿佛桑丘·潘沙爱戴堂·吉诃德。其次，三条狗白天都给关着，没有一点东西吃；晚上阿勃朗谷把它们放出来，照老犹太人精明的办法，教一条狗守在花园里一根柱子下面，柱子高头放着一块肉；一条守在院子里，也有一根同样的柱子；第三条关在楼下大厅内。要知道狗本能就是守家的，如今又被饥饿给拴住了，哪怕见到最漂亮的母狗，它们也不肯离开高悬食物的柱子，更不会东嗅西嗅地随便乱跑了。一有陌生人，三条狗就以为是来抢它们的肉吃；而那块肉是要等天明之后，阿勃朗谷才拿给它们的。这个刁钻古怪的办法真有说不尽的妙处。那些狗都一声不叫，玛古斯恢复了它们的野性，变得像印第安人一样狡猾。有一天，几个贼觉得屋子里静悄悄的，便大着胆子，以为一定能偷到老犹太人的钱。其中一个当先锋的，爬上花园的墙想跳下去。斗牛狗明明听到了，只是不理；等到那位先生的脚走近了，它就一口咬下，吃掉了。受伤的贼居然迸发着勇气翻过墙头，仗着腿上的骨头走路，直到同伴身边才晕倒，由他们抬了走。《司法日报》把这条极有风趣的巴黎夜新闻给登出来，大家还认为是杜撰的笑话。

七十五岁的玛古斯可能活到一百岁。尽管有钱，他的生活和两个雷蒙诺克的差不多。连对女儿予取予求的费用在内，他每月的开支也只要三千法郎。

三十五、懂画的人并不都在美术院


老人的生活比谁都有规律。天一亮就起来，早餐只吃些大蒜跟面包。这一顿直要维持到吃晚饭的时候。晚饭是和大家一起吃的。食物的菲薄跟修道院的相仿。早上到中午那段时间，古怪的老头儿在他陈列名画的几间屋子内走来走去，把家具，图画，所有的东西，掸灰抹尘，永不厌倦地欣赏着；然后他下楼到女儿屋里，享受一下为父之乐；然后他上街，到巴黎各处去奔跑，看拍卖，看展览会等等。遇到一件精品符合他的条件时，这家伙的生活就有了生气：他有件事要钩心斗角了，有一场马伦哥的仗要打了[1]。他使尽诡计，非用极便宜的代价把新看中的妃子收入后宫不可。玛古斯有他的欧洲地图，名作散布的地方都在图上记载明白。他托各地的同道刺探消息，经手买进的时候送他们一笔佣金。花这样许多心血的确是有收获的。

拉斐尔迷拼命寻访的两张不知下落的拉斐尔的画，给玛古斯弄到了。乔尔乔内替他为之丧命的情妇[2]所画的肖像，也在玛古斯手上；外边所谓的真迹其实都是临本。据玛古斯估计，他这一幅值到五十万法郎。他又有一张提香为查理五世画的《基督葬礼》，大画家当时还附了一封信给大皇帝，而现在这封亲笔信就粘在画的下角。他也有提香为菲利普二世画许多肖像的第一幅稿图。其余的九十七幅，画品与声名也都不相上下。有了这些宝物，难怪玛古斯要笑我们的美术馆了。他们让阳光从窗里透进来，损坏最美的作品，全不知玻璃窗的作用等于凹凸的镜片。原来画廊是只能从顶上取光的。玛古斯美术馆的护窗，都由他亲自启闭，照顾的周到像对他女儿一样，那又是他的一宝！这嗜画成癖的老人，的确懂得画的奥妙。他认为名作有它特殊的生活，每天都不同，而它的美是依赖光线的；他提到这些好像从前荷兰人提到郁金香[3]；对每幅不同的画，他有一定的钟点去欣赏，因为在天气晴朗的日子里，某幅画只有某一个时间才放射异彩。

这矮小的老头儿，穿着件粗呢大褂，上了十年的丝背心，满是油腻的裤子，露着光秃的脑袋，凹下去的脸，微微抖动的胡子，翘起的白须，凶狠的尖下巴，没有牙齿的嘴，眼睛跟他的狗的一样亮，有骨无肉的手，华表式的鼻子，全是皱痕而冰冷的皮肤，对着天才的创作欣然微笑：那在不活动的图画中间不是一幅活的图画吗！有三百万家财烘托的一个犹太人，永远是人间最美的一景。就凭我们的名演员劳贝·曼达出神入化的演技[4]，也表现不出这种诗情画意。像玛古斯一类有所信仰的怪物，世界上以巴黎为最多。伦敦的怪物，对自己的癖好临了会像对自己的生命一样感到厌倦的；唯有巴黎的狂人精神上始终与他的怪癖融成一片。你可以在街上看到邦斯与埃里·玛古斯之流，穿得非常寒酸，像法兰西学院的常任秘书一样心不在焉[5]，仿佛对什么都无所谓，对什么都没有感觉，既不注意妇女，也不注意橱窗，漫无目的地走着，口袋里空无所有，似乎脑子里也空无所有：你碰上这种人一定会奇怪他们是属于哪一个部落的。哎，这些家伙原来是百万富翁，是收藏家，是世界上最疯魔的人，为了要弄到一只杯子，一幅画，一件稀有的东西，不惜踏上轻罪法庭，像从前玛古斯在德国一样。

这便是雷蒙诺克很神秘地带着西卜女人去求见的专家。雷蒙诺克每次在大街上遇到玛古斯，总得请教一番。老犹太人也知道这个当伙计出身的人老实可靠，常常由阿勃朗谷出面借钱给他。弥尼末街和诺曼底街近得很，两个想发横财的同党十分钟就走到了。

“你可以见识到告老的古董商中最有钱的一个，巴黎最内行的鉴赏家……”雷蒙诺克对他的同伴说。

西卜太太一看矮小的老头儿穿着连西卜也不屑于修补的上装，先就呆住了；随后被他那双像猫一样冷静而狡猾的眼睛一扫，她更觉得毛骨悚然。他在楼下冷冰冰的大厅内，监督一个画家修整古画。

“什么事啊，雷蒙诺克？”他问。

“有些画要请你估价；巴黎只有你能告诉我，像我这样卖铜器的穷小子，不像你那么家私成千成万的，为那些画可以出多少钱。”

“东西在哪儿？”

“这位便是货主屋子里的门房，替那个先生打杂的，我已经跟她讲妥了……”

“货主姓什么？”

“邦斯！”西卜女人抢着说。

“没听见过。”玛古斯假痴假呆地回答，一边轻轻地把修补古画的人踩了一脚。

画家莫莱是知道邦斯美术馆的价值的，便突然抬起头来。这种微妙的表情，只能用在雷蒙诺克与西卜女人前面。犹太人的眼睛好似称金子的人的天平，一瞥之下已经把看门女人掂过了斤两。这一男一女当然不知道邦斯与玛古斯常常斗法。事实上，两个奇狠无比的收藏家彼此都很眼红。所以老犹太人一听到邦斯二字就心中一动，他从来不敢希望能踏进一个守卫如是严密的宝库。巴黎唯有邦斯美术馆能和玛古斯美术馆竞争。犹太人采取邦斯的收藏办法，比邦斯晚二十年；但因他是个兼做买卖的人，所以跟杜索末拉一样是邦斯不招待的。而邦斯与玛古斯，双方都存着同样嫉妒的心。一般家中有画廊的人往往喜欢出名：他们两个却没有这种虚荣。玛古斯要能仔细瞧一瞧穷音乐家的精美的藏品，其愉快就好比一个好色的人有个朋友把美丽的情妇藏在一边不让看见，而有朝一日居然溜进了她的上房。雷蒙诺克对这个怪人的尊敬，把西卜女人唬住了。凡是真正的力量，即使是不可解的，都有一股声势；看门女人在老头儿面前不知不觉变得听话了，柔和了。她不敢再拿出对付一般房客和她两位先生的专横的口气，她接受了玛古斯的条件，答应当天就带他进邦斯美术馆。这一下可是把敌人引进腹地，一刀扎入了邦斯的心窝。十年来邦斯老把钥匙随身带着，告诉西卜女人谁也不让进去，她一向对古董的意见和许模克的相同，也就听从了他的吩咐。因为老实的德国人把宝物当作小玩意儿，看着朋友着迷觉得可叹；看门女人受他的影响，也瞧不起古董，所以邦斯的美术馆十年工夫没有被闲人闯入。

邦斯病倒以后，戏院和私塾方面都由许模克替代。可怜的德国人为了保住两人的位置而包办一切，只能在早上和吃晚饭的时候见到朋友。他痛苦之极，所有的精力都给双份的工作消耗完了。女学生和戏院的同事，从他那儿知道了邦斯的病，看见可怜虫愁眉不展，就常常问起邦斯的情形；而钢琴家悲伤的程度，使那些不关痛痒的人也拉长着脸表示同情，像巴黎人听到了最大的灾难一样。好心的德国人，生命的本源和邦斯的受到同样深刻的打击；他熬着自己的痛苦，还得为了朋友的病而痛苦。所以他每次上课倒有一半时间在谈论邦斯，他会挺天真地中途停下来想着朋友今天怎么样，连年轻的女学生也留神听着他解释邦斯的病情了。两课之间要有空闲，他就奔回诺曼底街陪邦斯一刻钟。两人的钱都花完了，半个月来西卜太太尽量加增病费的开支，再拿这种坏消息去恐吓许模克。他虽然又惊又急，却出乎意外地发觉自己竟有勇气把悲痛压下去。为了要家里不缺少钱，他生平第一次想到挣钱的念头。有个女学生给两位朋友的境况感动了，问许模克怎么能把邦斯一个人丢在家里的，他却像受骗的老实人一样，不胜欣慰地微笑着说：“哎，小姐，我们有西卜太太呀！她又好又热心，把邦斯招呼得像王爷一样！”

可是，只要许模克一出门，西卜女人在家便是主人了。半个月不吃东西的邦斯，四肢无力地瘫在那儿，西卜女人为了铺床要他坐到沙发上去的时候，非得把他抱过去不可，他怎么还能监视这个所谓的好天使呢？

不用说，西卜女人是趁许模克吃中饭时去见玛古斯的。她回来，许模克正在跟他的朋友说再会。自从知道邦斯可以有笔大家私以后，西卜女人简直寸步不离，像孵小鸡似的老守着他。她坐在床前一张舒服的沙发里，开始东拉西扯，搬弄一套这等女人最拿手的废话，替邦斯解闷。假装温和驯良，体贴周到，老担着心事，她用种种权术把邦斯的心收拾得服服帖帖。

三十六、看门老婆子的唠叨与手段


西卜女人听了封丹太太的预言吓坏了，决意用软工夫，用不犯法的恶毒手段，在她先生的遗嘱上争个名字。十年工夫，她不知道邦斯美术馆的价值；现在她忽然把自己十年的忠诚，老实，没有一点私心，看作一笔资本，预备兑现了。想发财的欲望，在这女人心里好比在壳里伏了二十五年的一条蛇，那天被雷蒙诺克一句暗示金钱的话唤醒之下，她便把潜藏在心里的所有的邪念喂着它。至于她听了蛇的主意如何执行，看下文便知分晓。

“，喂，他有没有喝过很多水，咱们的宝贝病人？是不是好一些呢？”她问许模克。

“不行哪！我的好西卜太太！不行哪！”德国人抹着眼泪回答。

“哎！先生，你别这样慌，事情总得往好的方面想……哪怕西卜马上要死过去，我也不至于像你一样发愁。得了吧，咱们的宝贝病人身子很棒。再说，他一向规矩，你可不知道规矩的人年纪才活得大呢！对，他现在病势不轻，可是凭我这样的服侍，一定把他救过来。放心吧，你去干你的正经，我来陪他，拿大麦水给他喝。”

“要没有你，我才急死呢……”许模克捧着打杂女人的手握了一下，表示他的信任。

西卜女人抹着眼睛走进邦斯的屋子。

“怎么啦，西卜太太？”邦斯问。

“都是许模克先生使我心里乱糟糟的，他在那儿哭你，好像你已经死了！虽然你病在这里，还不至于要人家哭你哪；可是给他一急，我也忍不住了！天哪！我傻不傻，对你比对西卜还要关切！归根结底，你对我没有什么相干，除了大家同是亚当夏娃的子孙，咱们既不是亲又不是眷；可是一提到你呀，真的，我心就慌了。我可以牺牲一只手，当然是左手喽，真的，就在你面前割下来，只要能看到你能吃能喝，进进出出，从做买卖的手里骗到些便宜货，跟往常一样……我要有个孩子的话，我相信就会像爱你一样地爱他，不是吗？——来吧，好乖乖，你喝，把这一杯都喝下去！你喝不喝，先生！波冷医生对我说的：‘倘若邦斯先生不愿意进拉雪兹公墓，就得把奥弗涅人每天挑来卖的水，统统喝下去。’——所以你得喝！喝呀！……”

“我不是喝着吗，好西卜太太！……我喝了多少，整个的胃都给水淹了……”

“对，这才对啦！”门房女人接过了空杯子，“这样你就有救了！波冷先生有过一个跟你一样的病人，没有人照顾，儿女都不理他，结果就为这个病死的，因为不喝水！……所以你瞧，你得喝水！……那个人才给埋了两个月……喂，你知道没有，要是你死了，许模克那好人就完啦……我不说假话，他真是个孩子。哦！这羔羊似的人多爱你哟！从来没有一个女人这样地爱一个男人的！……他为了你吃不下喝不下，半个月到现在瘦得跟你一样，只剩皮包骨头了……我还看了忌妒呢，因为我挺喜欢你，可是不到他那地步，我没有吃不下饭，相反呢！成天楼上楼下地爬，我两条腿酸得不得了，夜里一上床就睡熟了，像块石头一样。不是吗，为了你，我顾不到可怜的西卜，只能托雷蒙诺克小姐给他弄饭，他对我叽叽咕咕，说每样东西都不行。我吗，我劝他，一个人应当为别人牺牲，说你的病不轻，不能把你丢在这儿……先是你不能雇一个老妈子服侍你！我招呼了你十年，替你管了十年家，怎受得了一个看护女人呢[1]？……她们都是贪嘴的家伙！一个人吃的要抵得十个人，又是酒，又是糖，又是脚炉，要这样那样的舒服……倘使病人不把她们写上遗嘱，她们还要偷东西……今天这儿来一个服侍病人的老妈子，明天就会少了一张画或是别的什么……”

“噢！西卜太太，”邦斯急得直嚷，“别离开我啊！……不准人家动我的东西！……”

“我在这儿呀！只要我吃得住，我不会走的……你放心！波冷先生说不定在打你的宝物的主意，他想教你雇个看护女人！……嘿！我老实不客气把他顶回去了，我说：‘先生只要我一个人服侍，他知道我的脾气，我也知道他的脾气。’——这样他才不作声了。哼，服侍病人的老妈子全是贼！我恨透了那些女人！……你才不知道她们多坏呢……有个老先生——还是波冷先生跟我讲的——对啦，一个什么萨巴底哀太太，三十六岁，从前在王宫市场做拖鞋生意的——你不是知道王宫市场从前有些开铺子的门面，现在给拆掉了吗？……”

邦斯点点头。

“且说那女人早先运气不好，丈夫是个酒鬼，中风死了；可是说句公道话，她长得真漂亮，可惜长得漂亮也不中用，交了些律师朋友也是白费……这样她就落难啦，平时专门服侍产妇，住在巴贝杜贝街。后来，她去看护一个老头儿，说句不文雅的话，他害着尿道病，要人给他通，像凿井似的，还得许多别的照顾，她只能睡在那个先生卧房里，搭一张帆布床。嗳！这种事说出来简直没人相信！也许你会说：‘男人都是不规矩的！只知道一味地自私自利！’——总之，她在房里老陪着他，逗他高兴，和他讲故事，有一搭没一搭的，就像咱们现在一样地瞎聊……她打听出来，原来老人有些侄子，都恶得很，给他受了很多气，说到末末了，他的病就是给侄子气出来的。后来哪，我的先生，她救了老人的命，嫁了他，生了个怪可爱的孩子，教母便是夏洛街上开肉铺子的老婆，因为鲍特凡太太跟那女的是亲戚……你瞧她这一回运气可好！……我吗，我嫁了人，可没有孩子，老实说，那只怪西卜不好，他太爱我了；因为倘使我要……，这样也好。有了孩子，我跟西卜俩怎么办？我们没有一点儿产业，没有一个钱，白做了三十年老实人，我的好先生！我觉得安慰的，就是从来没有拿过人家一个子儿，从来没有害过谁……打个譬喻，我这么说是没有关系的，因为要不了六个星期，包你起床到大街上去溜达了。我不过打个譬喻说，假使你把我写上遗嘱，那么，告诉你，我要不找到你的继承人把钱还掉，我就睡不着觉……因为我最怕不是自己流着汗挣来的钱。尽管你说：‘哦，西卜太太，你不用过意不去；那是你拿力气换来的，你把两位先生招呼得跟自己的孩子一样，一年替他们省了一千法郎……’因为先生，你知道吗，换了别个做饭的老妈子，在我的地位早已存起万把法郎了！——所以那位好先生送你一笔小小的终身年金，也是应该的—譬如人家对我这么说吧，可是不，我决不受，嗨！我是不贪心的！……我真不懂怎么有些女人待人好是为了有利可图……你想，先生，这还能算好事吗？……我不上教堂去，我没有那个工夫；可是我的良心告诉我什么叫作好什么叫作坏！……喂，你别这样乱动呀，我的宝贝！……别乱搔呀，我的天，你的脸多黄，黄得变成棕色了……一个人二十天工夫会像只柠檬，你说怪不怪！—清白老实是穷人的财产，一个人好歹总得有点东西！打个譬喻说，即使你快死了，我第一个会劝你把所有的东西都送给许模克先生。这是你的义务，你的家属只有他一个人！他可真爱你，这家伙，像一条狗爱它的主人一样。”

“唉！是的，”邦斯说，“我一辈子只有他爱我……”

三十七、一条美丽的手臂能有多少效果


“嗯！先生，”西卜太太说，“你这句话可不客气啦；那么我呢！难道我就不喜欢你啦？……”

“我没有这么说呀，我的好西卜太太……”

“得了吧！你把我当作一个老妈子，一个普通的厨娘，好像我是没心没肺的！哎唷！我的天！十一年工夫给两个老鳏夫做牛做马！一心一意为了他们的好，为了找块勃里乳饼，一跑就是几十家水果店，听人家冷言冷语；为了要买新鲜牛油，一直奔到中央菜场；大小事情没有一样不留神，十年工夫没有砸破一件东西，连一只碗角都不缺……简直像母亲待孩子一般！临了落得一声我的好西卜太太，明明是老先生心里不见你的情，可是你把他服侍得像王太子一样，哼，人家服侍罗马那位小国王还差得远呢！……我敢打赌他得不到你那样的照顾！……要不他怎么会年纪轻轻就死呢？……你瞧，先生，这不是你不公平吗……你没有良心！说来说去，不过因为我是个可怜的看门女人。哦！天哪，敢情你，你也拿我们当作狗看待的？……”

“哦！我的好西卜太太……”

“对，你是有学问的，请你讲给我听，干吗咱们当门房的要受到这种待遇，干吗把我们当作没心没肺，瞧咱们不起，如今不是讲平等吗？……我，我难道比不上别的女人？我当初还是一个巴黎最漂亮的姑娘，出名的牡蛎美人，求情说爱的话一天要听到七八回呢！……哪怕到了今天，只要我愿意！嗬，先生，你不是认得那个卖旧货的小家伙吗，住在大门旁边的？告诉你，倘使我做了寡妇，打个譬喻说，他会闭着眼睛娶我，他平常一双眼睛老盯着我，成天地对我说：‘噢！西卜太太，你这对胳膊多美！……我昨天晚上梦见你的胳膊变了面包，我变了牛油，躺在面包上！……’来，先生，瞧瞧我的胳膊！……”

她卷起衣袖，露出一条世界上最美的胳膊；手越红越干，胳膊越显得又白又嫩；那是一条丰腴的、浑圆的、有小涡的手臂，从粗呢料子的衣袖中脱颖而出，好似锦囊中抽出一把宝剑，邦斯只觉得一阵眼花，不敢久视。

“吓！给这条手臂打开的心，跟我的刀子劈开的牡蛎一样多！看见没有，这是西卜的。这亲爱的好人，只要我开声口，他为我从峭壁上跳下去都愿意；我真不该为了你冷淡了他，你先生只叫我声好西卜太太，我可不顾死活的，连办不到的事都想给你办……”

“你听我说啊，我总不成把你叫作我的妈妈，我的女人……”病人说。

“完啦完啦，我这一生这一世，再也不照应谁了……”

“你让我说好不好！”邦斯又道，“刚才我是在讲许模克。”

“许模克先生！对啦，他才是有良心的。他是喜欢我的，因为他穷！有了钱，心肠就硬了，你就是有了钱！好，你去找个看护老妈子吧，瞧她给你过的什么日子！要不把你折磨得像个金壳虫才怪！……医生吩咐要给你喝水，她偏给你吃东西！她要送你进坟墓，好抢你的家私！你不配西卜太太的招呼！……得啦，波冷先生来的时候，你叫他找个老妈子吧！”

“唉，要命！你听我的呀！”病人气得直叫，“我讲我的朋友许模克，又没扯到什么女人！……我很明白，真心爱我的只有你跟许模克！……”

“别这样生气好不好！”西卜女人嚷着，扑过去按着邦斯躺下。

“我怎么能不喜欢你呢？……”可怜的邦斯说。

“，你喜欢我，真的吗？……得啦，得啦，对不起，先生！”她一边说一边哭，抹着眼泪，“我知道，你喜欢我像喜欢一个老妈子是不是？……你扔给她六百法郎终身年金，好比拿块面包扔在狗窝里！……”

“噢！西卜太太，你拿我当作什么人？你不了解我！”

“啊！那么你不是这样对我的！”她说话之间看到邦斯瞧了她一眼，“你把好西卜太太当作母亲是不是？那对啦，我是你的母亲，你们两口儿都是我的孩子！哦！我要认得那些给你受气的人，我就得上重罪法庭了，甚至给抓进警察局也难说，因为我一定会挖掉他们的眼睛！……十恶不赦的东西，送到圣·约各门外去砍头还是便宜了他们呢！……你人这样好，心这样软，你生到世界上来就是为了使一个女人快活的……是的，你一定会使她快活……我一看就知道，你生来是这样的人……我早先看到你对许模克先生那么好，心里就想：‘可怜的邦斯先生白活了一辈子，天生他是个好丈夫……’我知道，你是喜欢女人的！”

“唉！是的，”邦斯说，“我可从来不曾有过女人！……”

“真的吗！”西卜女人带着挑逗的神气走近邦斯，抓着他的手。“敢情你不知道什么叫作有个疯疯癫癫的情妇听你摆布吗？那怎么可能！我要是你，要不尝到人生一世最快活的事儿，决不肯离开这个世界去进天堂……可怜的小贝贝！现在我要像从前的模样，不说假话，一定扔下西卜跟你！瞧你的鼻子长得多体面！怎么会这样体面的，嗯，我的小心肝？……你一定要说：看男人，不是每个女人都有眼睛的！……对，可叹她们都糊里糊涂地嫁错了人！我以为你情妇起码有一打，什么舞女呀，戏子呀，公爵夫人呀，因为你常常不在家！……看着你出门我老对西卜说：‘哟！邦斯先生又找野娘们玩儿去啦！’一句不假，我是这样说的，我真以为有多少女人爱你呢！你是天生地教人爱的……告诉你，我的好先生，你第一次在家里吃晚饭的时候，我就看出来了。哎唷！你瞧着许模克先生的欢喜，你多感动呵！第二天他还哭着对我说：‘西卜太太，他在家里吃过晚饭了！’我也跟着哭得昏天黑地。赶到你又上外边去闲逛，在别人家里吃饭，他就多难过呵！可怜的人！从来没见过像他那么样的伤心！你的确应当把家私送给他。不是吗，这个正直的好人，就是你的亲属！……你不能忘了他！要不上帝就不准你进天堂了。你得知道，没有义气的人，不送年金给朋友的人，都进不了天堂。”





三十八、初步的暗示


邦斯再三想回答，总是无法插嘴，西卜女人拉不断扯不断的话好比刮大风。蒸汽机还有方法教它停止，要拦住一个看门女人的舌头，恐怕发明家绞尽脑汁也想不出好办法。

“我知道你要说什么，”她抢着往下说，“好先生，一个人害了病，立张遗嘱并不会送命的；我要是你啊，我就要防个万一，我不愿意丢下那可怜的绵羊，真的，他是好天爷脚下的绵羊，一点儿事都不懂；我才不让他给吃公事饭的黑心人摆布，不让他落在那些坏蛋的家属手里呢！你说，二十天到现在，可有谁来看过你？……你还想把遗产送给他们！你可知道，有人说这里的东西值点儿钱吗？”

“我知道。”

“雷蒙诺克知道你是收藏家，他自己也在买进卖出，他说愿意给你三万法郎终身年金，只要你百年之后让他把画拿走……这倒是桩买卖！要是我，就答应下来了！可是他这么说，我以为他跟我开玩笑……你得把这些东西的价值告诉许模克先生，因为人家要哄他，就像哄孩子一般容易；你这些好东西能值多少，他一点儿念头都没有，连值钱两个字也没想到！他会三钱不值两文地给了人，倘使他不是为了爱你而一辈子留着，倘使他在你身后还能活着，因为你一死，他也会死的！可是放心，有我在这儿，我会保护他，抵抗所有的人！……我跟西卜两个。”

邦斯被她这一阵胡说八道感动了，觉得像所有平民阶级的人一样，她的感情的确很天真，便回答道：“好西卜太太，要没有你跟许模克，我真不知道要落到什么田地呢！”

“哦！世界上只有我们两个是你的朋友！那是不错的！两颗好心就胜过所有的家属……哼，甭提什么家属啦！家属好比一个人的舌头，像那个有名的戏子说的，最好的是它，最坏的也是它……你的亲人，他们在哪儿？你有亲人吗？……我从来没有见过……”

“就是他们把我气成这样的！……”邦斯不胜悲痛地嚷着。

“哦！你还有亲人……”西卜女人站起身子，仿佛她的沙发是一块突然烧红了的铁，“哎！好，他们真好，你的亲人！怎么！二十天了，对，到今儿早上已经二十天了，你病得死去活来，他们还没来问过一声！那可心肠太狠了！……我做了你，宁可把财产捐给育婴堂，决不给他们一个子儿！”

“好西卜太太，我本想把所有的东西都给我的外孙女的，她的父亲是我的嫡堂外甥加缪索庭长，你知道，就是两个月以前，有天早上来看我的那个法官……”

“哦！那个矮胖子，打发当差们来代他的女人向你赔罪的！……他的老妈子还跟我打听你呢，那只老妖精，我恨不得把扫帚柄在她的丝绒短斗篷上扫它两下呢。哪有一个老妈子穿丝绒斗篷的！，真是世界翻身了！革命，革命，干吗革命的？你们有办法，你们去吃两顿夜饭吧，有钱的浑蛋！我说，法律是没用的，倘使路易·菲利普就让人家没大没小地不分上下，那还有什么王法？因为，我们真要是平等的话，不是吗，先生，一个老妈子就不该穿丝绒斗篷，因为我西卜太太，做了三十年老实人还穿不上……这算哪一门的玩意儿？你总得教人看出你的身份。老妈子就是老妈子，就像咱家我是个看门的！要不军人戴那些肩章干吗？各人有各人的等级，怎么能胡来！这些七颠八倒的事，先生，要不要我告诉你最后一句话，那就是，法兰西是完了！……拿破仑在的时候，可不是这样的，你说是不是，先生？所以我对西卜说：‘你瞧，家里有了穿丝绒斗篷的老妈子，那家人准是没有心肝的……’”

“对啦，就是没有心肝！”邦斯回答。

于是他把心里的委屈跟痛苦讲给西卜太太听，她把那些亲戚尽量地咒骂，对每一句伤心的叙述都不怕过火地表示同情。末了她哭了。

要想象老音乐家与西卜太太之间突如其来的亲密，先得了解老鳏夫的处境。他生平第一遭害着重病，躺在床上受罪，举目无亲，孤零零地消磨日子；而他的日子特别来得长，因为他得和肝脏炎那种说不出的痛苦挣扎，那是连最美满的生活也要给破坏完的，何况他没有了事做，惦记着不花一钱就能看到的巴黎景象，更是意气消沉，像害了相思病。

这种孤独，这种暗淡的日子，这种生活的空虚，打击精神比打击肉体更厉害的痛苦，一切都逼得单身汉去依赖那个招呼他的人，好比淹在水里的人抓着一块木板；尤其他是生性懦弱，软心肠而又软耳朵的。所以邦斯对西卜女人的胡扯听得津津有味。在他心目中，全世界的人只有许模克、西卜太太和波冷医生，而他的卧室便是他整个的天地。普通的病人，精神只集中于目光所及的小范围，自私的心理只关切身边琐事，所依赖的只有一间屋子里的人和物；现在邦斯又是个老鳏夫，没有亲人，没尝过爱情的滋味，他的心境更可想而知了。病了二十天，他有时竟后悔没有娶玛特兰纳·维凡！所以二十天之内，西卜太太就在病人心中成为了不起的人物，仿佛没有她就没有命了。至于许模克，在可怜的病人旁边不过等于另外一个邦斯。西卜女人的巧妙，是在于无意之间代邦斯说出了心里的话。

“哦！医生来啦。”她听见门铃响，就一边说着一边丢下了邦斯，明知那是犹太人和雷蒙诺克上门了。

“你们两位轻声点儿！”她说，“别让他听见什么！一牵涉到他的宝贝，他火气就大啦。”

“只要绕一转就够了。”犹太人回答。他手里拿着一个放大镜和一个手眼镜。





三十九、狼狈为奸


邦斯美术馆存放大部分作品的屋子，是从前建筑师替法国旧贵族设计的那种老式客厅，有二十五英尺宽，三十英尺长，十三英尺高。四面挂着邦斯藏的六十七幅画，墙上装有白漆描金的护壁板，白漆已经发黄，描金已经变红，和谐的色调倒也不妨害画的效果。柱头上放着十四座雕像，有的在屋角，有的在画中间，柱子一律是布勒出品。靠壁半人高的地位摆着紫檀木酒柜，每个都刻花，富丽堂皇，放的是各式古玩。客厅中间，一排雕花的食器柜上全是最珍贵的手工艺品：象牙，铜器，木雕，珐琅，金银器物，瓷器，等等。

犹太人踏进宝殿，立刻认出四幅最精彩的画，直奔过去，那些作家是他的收藏中没有的。他的心情，仿佛博物学者发现了采集不到的标本，不惜从西方跑到东方，踏进热带，跋涉沙漠，横渡大草原，穿越原始森林去寻访的。

四幅画中第一幅是塞巴斯蒂亚诺·德·皮翁博的，第二幅是弗拉·巴多洛美奥的，第三幅是霍培玛的风景，第四幅是亚尔倍·丢勒的《女像》，简直是四宝！在绘画史上，塞巴斯蒂亚诺是集三大画派的精粹于一身的人。他原来是威尼斯画家，到罗马去在米开朗琪罗的指导之下学拉斐尔的风格。米开朗琪罗有心训练自己的大弟子，用拉斐尔的方法去攻倒拉斐尔。因此，塞巴斯蒂亚诺虽是懒散的天才，但在为数有限而相传稿本出于米开朗琪罗手笔的画上，的确把威尼斯派的色彩，佛罗伦萨派的布局，与拉斐尔的风格熔于一炉。这种兼有三家之长的艺术，其完美的程度可以从巴黎美术馆藏的《庞第奈里肖像》[1]上看到，它可以毫无愧色地与提香的《拿着手套的人》，拉斐尔的那幅兼有柯勒乔之妙的《老人像》，莱昂纳多·达·芬奇的《查理八世像》相比。这四幅都有一样的光彩与色泽，异曲同工，价值相等。人类的艺术可以说是至此而极。它还胜过自然，因为自然界的美不过是昙花一现。邦斯藏的塞巴斯蒂亚诺的画，是画在石板上的《玛德派教徒的祈祷》，其鲜艳，工整，沉着，还有过于《庞第奈里肖像》。巴多洛美奥的《圣家庭》，可能有好多鉴赏家认作拉斐尔的画。霍培玛的风景在标卖时可以值到六万法郎。丢勒的《女像》，很像有名的纽伦堡的《霍邱肖像》。霍邱和丢勒是朋友，那张肖像曾经由荷兰、普鲁士、巴维哀几邦的君主出到二十万法郎想收买，而且想收买了几次都没成功。邦斯这幅，画的或许便是霍邱的妻子或女儿。这假定很有可能，因为画上女人所摆的姿势，显然跟另一张是对称的；而爵徽的画法、地位，在两幅上也相同。最后，旁边写的四十一岁，也和另一幅上的年龄相配。不消说，纽伦堡霍邱家的后人对那幅藏画素来视为至宝，最近才完成了一张铜刻的图。

埃里·玛古斯轮流瞧着四幅画，眼泪都冒上来了。

“这几张画，你要是能让我花四万法郎买到，我每张送你两千法郎酬劳……”他咬着西卜女人的耳朵说。西卜女人听到这一笔天外飞来的横财，不由得愣住了。

犹太人的欣赏到了如醉若狂的境界；神志乱了，平时的贪心也动摇了，他没头没脑地沉浸在里面了。

“那么我呢？……”雷蒙诺克问，他对画还是外行。

“这里的东西都没有什么高低，”犹太人很狡猾地附着奥弗涅人的耳朵说，“随便挑十张画，跟我一样的条件，你就发财啦！”

三个人你望着我，我望着你；贪欲获得了满足，每个人都咂摸着人生最大的快乐。不料病人一声叫喊，像钟声似的在空气中余音不绝……

“谁呀？……”邦斯嚷着。

“先生，你睡下去呀！”西卜女人奔过去硬要邦斯睡下，“嗯！你不想活吗？……来的不是波冷先生，是那个好人雷蒙诺克，他不放心你，特意来打听你的消息！……瞧大家对你多好，全屋子的人都在为你着急。你怕什么呢？”

“我听你们有好几个人呢。”病人说。

“好几个！哦！你在做梦吗？这样下去，你会发疯的，告诉你！……好，你瞧吧。”西卜女人奔过去打开房门，递个眼色叫玛古斯退后去，叫雷蒙诺克上前来。

“嗳，亲爱的先生，”奥弗涅人顺着西卜女人的口气说，“我来伺候你，这屋里的人为了你都觉得害怕……你知道，谁都不喜欢屋子有死神进门的！……还有莫尼斯特洛老头，你不是跟他很熟吗？他要我对你说，倘使要用钱，他可以帮忙……”

“哼，他派你来瞧瞧我的古董！……”老收藏家起了疑心，说话很不客气。

害肝病的人几乎都有一种特殊的、说来就来的反感；他们的肝火会盯住某一件东西或某一个人。邦斯一心一意只想守护他的宝物，以为有人在觊觎它们；他平日常叫许模克去瞧瞧可有人溜进禁地。

“你的收藏相当精，可能引起收货的人注意，”雷蒙诺克很调皮地回答，“我对高等古玩是外行，但大家认为你先生是大鉴赏家，所以我虽然不大懂，也愿意闭着眼睛向你先生买点东西……倘使你要用钱的话，因为这些要命的病是最花钱的……上回我姊妹闹肚子，十天工夫就花了三十铜子，其实不吃药也会好的……医生都是些坏蛋，专门趁火打劫……”

“再见，先生，谢谢你。”邦斯一边回答，一边很不放心地把眼睛盯着旧货鬼。

“我送他出去吧，”西卜女人轻轻地告诉病人，“免得他拿了什么东西。”

“对，对。”病人不胜感激地向西卜女人递了个眼色。

西卜女人带上房门，这个举动可又引起了邦斯的疑心。她走出去看见玛古斯一动不动地站在四幅画前面。只有能体会理想的美，对登峰造极的艺术有股说不出的感情，会几小时地站在那里鉴赏达·芬奇的《蒙娜丽莎》，柯勒乔的《安底奥泼》，安特莱·但尔·萨多的《圣家庭》与《提香的情妇》，陶米尼耿的《花丛中的儿童》，拉斐尔的单色画和《老人像》的人，才能了解玛古斯那种出神的境界。

“你轻轻地走吧！”西卜女人吩咐他。

犹太人慢慢地、一步一步地倒退出去，眼睛老瞅着画，好比一个情人望着情妇向她告别。

四十、狡猾的攻击


西卜女人看到犹太人的出神，心里就有了主意；一到楼梯口，她拍了拍玛古斯全是骨头的胳膊。

“你每张画得给我四千法郎！不然就拉倒……”

“我没有那么多钱呀！我想要那些画是为了爱好，为了爱艺术，我的漂亮太太！”

“好小子，你这样啬刻，还知道爱！今儿要不当着雷蒙诺克把一万六答应下来，明儿就要你两万了。”

“一万六就一万六。”犹太人被看门女人的贪心吓坏了。

“犹太人不是基督徒，他们能够凭什么赌咒？……”她问雷蒙诺克。

“放心，你相信他得了，他跟我一样靠得住。”收旧货的回答。

“那么你呢？我要让你买到了东西，你怎么酬劳我？……”

“赚的钱大家对分。”雷蒙诺克马上说。

“我宁可拿现钱，我不是做买卖的。”

“你真内行！”玛古斯笑道，“做起买卖来倒真够瞧的。”

“我劝她跟我合伙，把身体跟财产统统并过来，”奥弗涅人抓着西卜女人的胖手臂，用锤子一样的力气拍了几下，“除了她的漂亮，我又不要她别的资本。——你老跟着西卜傻不傻？像你这样的美人儿，可是一个门房能教你发财的？哦！一朝坐在大街上的铺子里，四面摆满了古董，跟那些收藏家聊聊天，花言巧语地哄哄他们，你该是何等人物！等你在这儿捞饱了，赶快丢开门房，瞧咱们俩过的什么日子吧！”

“捞饱了！”西卜女人嚷道，“这儿我连一根针都不肯拿的，听见没有，雷蒙诺克！街坊上谁不知道我是一个规规矩矩的女人，嘿！”

西卜女人眼里冒出火来。

“，你放心！”玛古斯说，“这奥弗涅人太爱你了，绝不是说你坏话。”

“你瞧她会给你招来多少买主！”奥弗涅人又补了一句。

“你们也得说句公道话，”西卜太太的态度缓和了些，“让我把这里的情形讲给你们听听……十年工夫我不顾死活地服侍这两个老鳏夫，除了空话，没有到手过一点东西……雷蒙诺克知道得清清楚楚，我给两个老头儿包饭，每天要贴掉二三十个铜子，把我所有的积蓄都花光了。真的，我可以凭我妈妈的在天之灵起誓！……我从小只知道有娘，不知道有爷的；可是像咱们头上的太阳一样千真万确，我要有半句谎话，我的咖啡就变成毒药！……现在一个不是快死了吗？并且还是有钱的一个……我把两个都当作亲生的孩子呢！……唉，你们可想得到，二十天工夫我老告诉他，他快死了，（因为波冷先生早说他完了！……）那吝啬鬼可没有半句口风把我写上遗嘱，就像是不认识我的一样！现在我真相信，咱们的名分一定要自己去拿；靠继承人吗？趁早别想！嘿！说句不好听的话：世界上的人都是浑蛋！”

“不错，”玛古斯假惺惺地说，“倒还是我们这批人老实……”他眼望着雷蒙诺克补上一句。

“别跟我打岔，我又不拉上你……就像那戏子说的，一个人盯得紧，一定会成功！……我可以起誓，两位先生已经欠了我近三千法郎，我的一点儿积蓄都给买了药，付了他们的家用什么的，要是他们不认这笔账的话，那……唉，我真傻，我这老实人还不敢跟他们提呢。亲爱的先生，你是做买卖的，你说我要不要去找个律师？……”

“律师！”雷蒙诺克嚷道，“你比所有的律师都强呢！……”

这时有件笨重的东西倒在饭厅里地砖上，声音一直传到空荡荡的楼梯间。

“哎啊！我的天！”西卜女人叫着，“什么事呀？好像是我的先生摔筋斗啦！……”

她把两个同党一推，他们马上身手矫捷地奔了下去。然后她回进屋子，赶到饭厅，看见邦斯只穿一件衬衣，躺在地下晕过去了。她像捡一片羽毛似的抄起老人身子，把他一直抱到床上。她拿烧焦的鸡毛给他嗅，用科隆水擦他的脑门，慢慢地把他救转了。赶到邦斯睁开眼睛活了过来，她就把拳头往腰里一叉，说道：

“光着脚！只穿一件衬衫！这不是寻死吗？再说，你干吗疑心我？……要是这样，那么再会吧，先生。我服侍了你十年，把自己的钱贴作你们的家用，把积蓄都搅光了，只为的不要让可怜的许模克先生操心，他在楼梯上哭得像个小娃娃……想不到如今我落得这种报酬！你偷偷地刺探我……所以上帝要罚你……好，跌得好！我还拼了命把你抱起来，顾不得下半世会不会犯个毛病……哦！天哪！我连大门都没关呢……”

“你跟谁讲话啊？”

“亏你问得出这种话！我是你的奴隶吗，嗯？你管得着我？告诉你，你要这样地跟我怄气，我什么都不管了！你去找个看护老妈子吧！”

邦斯听了这句话的惊吓，无意中使西卜太太看出了她那个杀手锏的力量。

“那是我的病！”他可怜巴巴地说。

“那还好！”西卜太太很不客气地回答。

说完她走了，让邦斯怪不好意思的，暗暗地埋怨自己，觉得他多嘴的看护一片忠心，真是了不起；至于跌在饭厅里地砖上使他的病加重的那些痛苦，他倒反忘了。





四十一、关系更密切了


西卜女人看见许模克正在上楼。

“你来，先生……我有坏消息告诉你！邦斯先生疯了！……你想得到吗，他光着身子从床上起来，跟着我……真的，他笔直地躺在那儿……你问他为什么，他就说不上来……他不行哪。我又没有做什么事引起他这种神经病，除非是提到了他从前的爱情，惹起了他的心火……男人的脾气真是看不透的！哼，都是些老色鬼……我不该在他面前露出胳膊，使他眼睛亮得像一对红宝石……”

许模克听着西卜太太，好像她讲的是希伯来文。

“我过分用了力，受了内伤，怕一辈子不会好了！……”西卜女人说着，装出一阵阵剧烈的痛苦。原来她不过有些筋骨酸痛，随便想到的；可是她灵机一动，觉得大可借题发挥，利用一下。“我真傻！看他躺在地上，我就一把抄起，直抱到床上，当时只像抱个孩子。可是现在我觉得脱力了！哎唷！好疼啊！……我要下楼了，你招呼病人吧。我要叫西卜去请波冷先生来给我瞧瞧！要是残废，我宁可死的……”

她抓着楼梯的栏杆，一步步地爬，嘴里不住地哼哼叫痛，吓得每层楼上的房客都跑到了楼梯台上。许模克流着眼泪扶着她，一路把看门女人奋不顾身的事迹讲给大家听。不久，上上下下，四邻八舍，都知道西卜太太如何英勇，如何为了抱一个榛子钳而得了内伤，据说还有性命之忧呢。许模克回到邦斯身边，把管家婆受伤的情形告诉了他，两人都瞪着眼睛问：“没有她，咱们怎么办呢？……”许模克看见邦斯跌了一跤以后的神色，不敢再埋怨他。

可是等到他弄明白了原委，就大声说道：“该死的古董！我宁可把它们烧掉，总不能丢了我的朋友！西卜太太把积蓄都借给了我们，还疑心她？那太没有道理了；可是也难怪，这是你的病……”

“唉！这个病啊！我也觉得我自己变了。我可真不愿意教你难过，亲爱的许模克。”

“好吧，你要埋怨就埋怨我！别跟西卜太太找麻烦……”

西卜太太终身残疾的危险性，不消几天就由波冷医生给消灭了。这场病能治好，被认为是奇迹，波冷在玛莱区的声望顿时大为提高。他在邦斯家里说那是靠她的身体结实。从第七天起，她又在两位先生家当差了，他们俩为此都十分高兴。经过了这件事，看门女人对两个榛子钳生活上的影响与权力，凭空加了一倍。那一星期内他们又欠了债，由她代还了。西卜女人借此机会，毫不费力地从许模克手里弄到一张两千法郎的借票，据说那是她替两位朋友垫的钱。

“哦！波冷医生的本领真了不得！”西卜女人对邦斯说，“放心，先生，他一定能把你治好，我的命就是他给救过来的！可怜的西卜已经拿我当死人了！……波冷先生想必告诉过你，我躺在床上一心一意只记挂你，我说：‘上帝啊，把我带去吧，让亲爱的邦斯先生活着吧……’”

“可怜的好西卜太太，你差点儿为了我残废！……”

“唉！没有波冷先生，我早已躺在棺材里了。像从前那戏子说的，我只好听天由命！什么事总要看得开。我不在这儿的时候，你怎么办的？”

“全靠许模克服待我；可是我们的钱跟我们的学生都受了影响……我不知道他怎么对付的。”

“急什么，邦斯！”许模克回答，“有西卜老头做我们的银行老板呢……”

“这话甭提啦，亲爱的绵羊！”西卜女人叫道，“你们俩是我们的孩子。我们的积蓄存在你们那儿不是顶好吗？比法兰西银行还靠得住。只要我们有一块面包，你们就有半块……所以你那些话提也不值得提……”

“好西卜太太！”许模克这么说着，出去了。

邦斯一声不出。西卜女人看他心里烦恼，就说：“你相信吗，小宝贝？我在床上死去活来的时候——因为我真的差点儿回老家！——我最不放心的就是丢下你们，让你们孤零零的，还有丢下两手空空的可怜的西卜！我们的积蓄一共也没多少，我不过随便跟你提一句，因为想到了我的死，想到了西卜。他真是个天使，把我服侍得像王后，为了我一把鼻涕一把眼泪地哭得昏天黑地。我是相信你们的，我对他说：得了吧，西卜，我的两位东家不会让你没有饭吃的……”

对于这个针对遗嘱的攻势，邦斯一声不出，看门女人静静地等他开口。

“我会把你交托给许模克的。”病人终于说了这一句。

“啊，你怎么办都好！反正我相信你，相信你的良心……这些话都甭提啦，你要教我不好意思了，好贝贝；你快点儿好吧，你比我们都活得长呢……”

西卜太太心里很嘀咕，决意要她东家说明预备给她什么遗产。第一步，她等晚上许模克在病人床前吃晚饭的时候，出门去看波冷医生了。





四十二、巴黎所有初出道的人的历史


波冷医生住在奥莱昂街。他占着底层的一个小公寓，包括一个穿堂，一个客厅，两间卧房。一边通穿堂一边通医生卧室的一间小屋子，改成了看诊室。另外附带一个厨房，一间仆人的卧室，一个小小的地窖。小公寓属于正屋侧面的陪房部分。整幢屋子很大，是帝政时代拆掉了一座老宅子盖起来的，花园还保留着，分配给底层的三个公寓。

医生住的公寓四十年没有刷新过。油漆，花纸，装修，全是帝政时代的。镜子，框子的边缘，花纸上的图案，天花板，垩漆，都积着一层四十年的油腻灰土。虽是在玛莱区的冷角里，这小公寓每年还得一千法郎租金。医生的母亲波冷太太，六十七岁，占着另外一间卧房。她替裤子裁缝做些零活，什么长筒鞋套、皮短裤、背带、腰带和一切有关裤子的零件；这行手艺现在已经衰落了。又要照顾家务，又要监督儿子的那个独一无二的仆人，她从来不出门，只在小花园中换换空气；那是要打客厅里的一扇玻璃门中走出去的。她二十年前做了寡妇，把专做裤子的裁缝铺盘给了手下的大伙计；他老是交些零活给她做，使她能挣到三十铜子一天。她为独养儿子的教育牺牲一切，无论如何要他爬上高出父亲的地位。眼看他当了医生，相信他一定会发达，她继续为他牺牲，很高兴地照顾他，省吃俭用，只希望他日子过得舒服，爱他也爱得非常识趣，那可不是每个母亲都能办到的。波冷太太没有忘了自己是女工出身，不愿意教儿子受人嘲笑或轻视，因为这好太太讲话多用S音，正像西卜太太的多用N音。偶然有什么阔气的病人来就诊，或是中学的同学，或是医院的同事来看儿子，她就自动地躲到房里去。所以波冷医生从来不用为他敬爱的母亲脸红；她所缺少的教育，由她体贴入微的温情给补救了。铺子大约盘到两万法郎，寡妇在一八二〇年上买了公债；她的全部财产便是每年一千一百法郎的利息。因此有好多年，邻居们看到医生母子的衣服都晾在小花园里的绳子上；为要省钱，所有的衣服都由老太太和仆人在家里洗。这一点日常琐事对医生很不利；人家看他这么穷，就不大相信他的医道。一千一的利息付了房租。开头的几年，清苦的家庭都是由矮胖的老太太做活来维持的。披荆斩棘地干了十二年，医生才每年挣到三千，让老太太大约有五千法郎支配。熟悉巴黎的人都知道这是最低限度的生活。

病人候诊的客厅，家具十分简陋：一张挺普通的桃木长沙发，面子是黄花的粗丝绒的，四张安乐椅，六张单靠，一张圆桌，一张茶桌，都是裤子裁缝的遗物，当年还是他亲自选购的。照例盖着玻璃罩的座钟是七弦琴的形式；旁边放着两个埃及式的烛台。黄地红玫瑰花的布窗帘，居然维持了那么些年。姚伊工厂这种恶俗的棉织物，想不到一八〇九年奥倍刚夫初出品时还得到拿破仑的夸奖。看诊间的家具，格式也相仿，大半拿父亲卧房里的东西充数。一切显得呆板、寒碜、冰冷。如今广告的力量高于一切，协和广场的路灯杆都给镀着金漆，让穷人自以为是有钱的公民而觉得安慰；在这种时代，哪个病家会相信一个没有名没有家具的医生是有本领的？

穿堂兼做饭厅；老妈子没有厨房工作或不陪老太太的时候，就在这儿做活。你一进门，看到这间靠天井的屋子，窗上挂着半红半黄的纱窗帘，你就能猜到这个凄凉的、大半日没有人的公寓，情形是怎么悲惨。壁橱里准是些发霉的面团，缺角的盘子，旧瓶塞，整星期不换的饭巾，总之是巴黎的小户人家舍不得的丑东西，早该扔进垃圾篓的。所以，在这个大家把五法郎一块的钱老放在心上老挂在嘴边的时代，三十五岁的医生只能做个单身汉。他的母亲在社会上是拉不到一点关系的。十年之间，在他行医的那些家庭中，可以促成罗曼史的机会，他连一次也没碰上。他的病人，生活情形都和他的不相上下；他看到的不是小职员便是做小工业的。最有钱的主顾是肉店老板、面包店老板，和一区里比较大一些的零售商；这等人病好了，大多认为是天意，所以对这个拼着两腿走得来的医生，只要送两法郎的诊费就够了。医生的车马往往比他的学识更重要。

平凡而刻板的生活，久而久之对一个最冒险的人也免不了有影响。人总是适应自己的境遇的，早晚会忍受生活的平庸。因此，波冷医生干了十年还继续在做他的苦工，而开场特别觉得苦闷的那种失意也早已没有了。虽然如此，他还存着一个梦想，因为巴黎人全有个梦想。雷蒙诺克，西卜女人，都做着自己的梦很得意。波冷医生的希望是碰到一个有钱有势的病人，由他一手治好，然后靠这个病人的力量谋到一个差事，不是什么医院的主任，便是监狱医生，或是几个大戏院的，或是部里的医生。他能当上区公所的医官就是走的这个路子。西卜太太介绍他去看她的房东比勒洛，被他治好了。比勒洛是包比诺伯爵夫人的舅公，病愈之后去向医生道谢，看他清苦，便有心照应他，要求那个很敬重他的外甥孙婿，那时正在部长任上，给他弄到这个区公所的位置。这是五年以前的事，有了这笔微薄的薪水，波冷才放弃了铤而走险的出国计划。一个法国人，非到山穷水尽的田地是决不肯离开本国的。波冷医生特意登门向包比诺伯爵道谢；可是这位要人的医生是大名鼎鼎的皮安训，当然波冷没有取而代之的希望。十六年来，包比诺是当轴最亲信的十几位红人之一，可怜的医生以为得到了这位部长的提拔，不料结果仍旧隐没在玛莱区，在穷人与小布尔乔亚中间混，只多了个每年一千二百法郎的差事，逢着区里有死亡报告的时候去检验一下。

波冷当年实习的成绩很好，开业之后非常谨慎，经验也不少了。并且在他手里死掉的病人，家属决不会起哄；他尽有机会实地研究各种各样的病。这样的人会有多少牢骚当然是可想而知的了。天生的瘦长脸本来已经很忧郁，有时候表情简直可怕：好比黄皮纸上画着一双眼睛，像答尔丢夫一样火辣辣的，神气跟阿赛斯德的一样阴沉[1]。医道不下于有名的皮安训，自以为给一双铁手压得无声无臭的人，该有怎样的举动、姿势、目光，你们自己去想象吧。他最幸运的日子可以有十法郎收入，而皮安训每天的进款是五六百：波冷不由自主地要作这个比较。这不是把德谟克拉西所促成的妒恨心理暴露尽了吗？再说，这被压迫的野心家并没什么可以责备自己的地方。他为了想发财，曾经发明一种近乎莫里松丸的通便丸，交给一个转业为药剂师的老同学去发行。不料药剂师爱上滑稽剧院的一个舞女，破产了；而药丸的执照用的是药剂师的名义，那个了不得的发明便给后任的药房老板发了财。老同学动身上墨西哥淘金，又带走波冷一千法郎积蓄。他跑去问舞女讨债，反被人家当作放印子钱的。自从比勒洛老人病好之后，波冷没有碰到一个有钱的病家。他只能像只吃不饱的猫，在玛莱区拼着两条腿奔东奔西，看上一二十个病人，拿两个铜子到两法郎的诊费[2]。要遇到一个肯出钱的病家，对他简直比登天还难。

没有案子的青年律师，没有病家的青年医生，是巴黎特有的两种最苦闷的人：心里有苦说不出，身上穿的黑衣服黑裤子，线缝都发了白，令人想起盖在顶楼上的锌片，缎子背心有了油光，帽子给保护得小心翼翼，手套是旧的，衬衫是粗布的，那是首悲惨的诗歌，阴森可怕，不下于监狱里的牢房。诗人、艺术家、演员、音乐家等等的穷，还穷得轻松，因为艺术家天生爱寻快乐，也有得过且过、满不在乎的脾气，就是使天才们慢慢地变成孤独的那种脾气。可是那两等穿黑衣服而坐不起车的人，因职业关系只看到人生的烂疮和丑恶的面目。他们初出道的艰苦时期，脸上老带着凶狠与愤愤不平的表情，郁结在胸中的怨恨与野心，仿佛一场大火潜伏在那里，眼睛就是一对火苗。两个老同学隔了二十年再见的时候，有钱的会躲开那个潦倒的，会不认得他，会看着命运在两人之间划成的鸿沟而大吃一惊。一个是时来运转，登上了云路；一个是在巴黎的泥淖中打滚，遍体鳞伤。见了波冷医生那件外套与背心而躲开的老朋友，不知有多少！

现在我们就很容易明白，为什么在西卜女人假装重伤的那出戏里，波冷医生配搭得那么好。各种贪心，各种野心，都是体会得到的。他一方面看到门房女人的五脏六腑没有一点损伤，脉搏那么正常，动作那么灵活，一方面又听她高声叫痛，他就懂得她的装死作活是有作用的。把这假装的重症很快地治好，不是可以在本区里轰动一下吗？他便夸大其词地说西卜女人受的伤变了肠脱出，必须急救才有希望。他拿许多所谓秘方灵药给她，又替她做了一个不可思议的手术，结果非常圆满。他在台北兰医生的验方大全中找出一个古怪的病例，应用到西卜太太身上，还很谦虚地把这次的成绩归功于伟大的外科医生，说他自己不过是仿照名医的治疗罢了。巴黎一般初出道的人就是这样穷极无聊。只要能爬上台，什么都可以用作晋身之阶；不幸世界上没有一样东西用不坏的，便是梯子也不能例外，所以每行里的新进人物简直不知道哪种木料的踏级才靠得住了。你自以为成功的事，有时巴黎人竟给你一个不理不睬。他们因为捧场捧腻了，便像宠惯的孩子一般噘着嘴，不愿意再供奉什么偶像；或者说句真话，有时他们根本找不到有才气的人值得一捧。蕴藏天才的矿山，出品也有停顿的时候，那时巴黎人就表示冷淡了，他们不是永远乐意把庸才装了金来膜拜的。

四十三、只要耐心等待，自会水到渠成


西卜太太照例横冲直撞地闯进去，正碰到医生跟他的老母亲在饭桌上。他们吃着所有的生菜中最便宜的莴苣生菜。饭后点心只有一小尖角的勃里乳饼，旁边摆着一盆四叫花果子[1]，只看见葡萄梗，还有一盆起码货的苹果。

“母亲，你不用走，”医生按着波冷太太的手臂，“这位便是我跟你提过的西卜太太。”

“太太万福，先生万福，”西卜女人说着，往医生端给她的椅子上坐了下来，“哦！这位就是老太太？有这样一位能干的少爷，老人家真是好福气！因为，太太，他是我的救命恩人，是他把我从死路上拉回来的。”

波冷寡妇听见西卜太太这样恭维她的儿子，觉得她挺可爱。

“亲爱的波冷先生，我这番来是报告你，反正咱们说说不要紧，可怜的邦斯先生情形很不好；并且为了他，我有话跟你谈……”

“我们到客厅去坐吧。”波冷指着仆人对西卜太太做了个手势。

一进客厅，西卜女人就长篇大论地讲她跟两个榛子钳的关系，又把借钱的故事添枝加叶地背了一遍，说她十年来对邦斯与许模克帮了不知多大的忙。听她的口气，要没有她那种慈母一般的照顾，两个老人早已活不成了。她自居为天使一流；扯了那么多的谎，浇上大把大把的眼泪，把波冷老太太也听得感动了。

末了她说：“你明白，亲爱的先生，第一我要知道邦斯先生打算把我怎么安排，要是他死下来的话；当然，我决不希望有这一天，因为，太太，你知道，我的生活就是照顾这两个好人；可是，我要丢了一个，还可以照应另外一个。我是天生的热心人，只想做人家的母亲。要没有人让我关切，当作自己的孩子一样，我简直过不了日子……所以，倘使波冷先生肯替我在邦斯先生面前说句话，我真是感激不尽，一定会想法报答的。天哪！一千法郎的终身年金，可能算是多要吗，我问你？……这对许模克先生也有好处……咱们的病人对我说，他会把我嘱托给德国人，那是他心中的继承人……可是这先生连一句像样的法国话也说不上来，我能指望他什么？再说，朋友一死，心里一气，他可能回德国去的……”

“亲爱的西卜太太，”医生的态度变得很严肃，“这一类的事跟医生不相干。倘使有人知道我替病家的遗嘱出主意，我的开业执照就要被吊销。医生接受病人的遗产，是法律禁止的……”

“有这种混账法律吗！我要跟你分遗产，谁管得了？”西卜女人马上回答。

“不但如此，我还要进一步告诉你，我不能违背我做医生的良心，对邦斯先生提到他的死。先是他的病还没有危险到这个地步；其次，这种话在我嘴里说出来，他要大受刺激，加重病势，那时他真的有性命之忧了……”

“可是我老实不客气劝过他料理后事，他的病也不见得更坏……他已经听惯了！……你不用怕。”

“这些话一句都甭提了，好西卜太太！……那是公证人的事，跟医生毫无关系……”

“可是，亲爱的波冷先生，倘若邦斯先生自己问起你他的情形，要不要防个万一，那时你可愿意告诉他，把后事料理清楚也是恢复健康的好办法吗？……然后你再找机会替我说句话……”

“哦！要是他跟我提到立遗嘱的话，我决不阻挡他。”

“好啦，这不就得了吗！”西卜太太嚷着，“我特意来谢谢你为我费的心，”她把一个封着三块金洋的小纸包塞在医生手里，“眼前我只有这点儿小意思。啊！……我要有了钱，一定忘不了你，亲爱的波冷先生，你这还不像好天爷到了世界上来吗！……太太，你家少爷真是个天使！”

西卜太太站起身来，波冷太太挺客气地跟她行了礼，然后医生把她送到门外。到了这里，这位下层阶级的麦克白夫人[2]，忽然胸中一亮，好像给魔鬼点醒了似的，觉得医生对她假装的病既然收了诊费，一定能做她的同党。

“亲爱的波冷先生，”她说，“我受伤的事，你已经帮了忙，怎么不愿意说几句话，救救我的穷呢？……”

医生觉得自己落在了魔鬼手里，他的头发被它无情的利爪一把抓住了。为这么一点小事而坏了名声，他不由得怕起来，马上想到一个同样阴险的念头。

“西卜太太，”他把她拉回到看诊室里，“我欠你的情分，让我还了你吧，我在区公所的差事是靠你得来的……”

“咱们平分就是了。”她抢着说。

“分什么？”

“遗产呀！”

“你不了解我，”医生拿出道学家的神气，“这种话不能再提。我有个中学里的同学，非常聪明，我们特别知己，因为彼此的遭遇都差不多。我念医学的时候，他在念法律；我在医院里实习，他在诉讼代理人古丢尔那儿办公事。我是裤子裁缝的儿子，他是鞋匠的儿子；他没有得到人家的好感，也没有张罗到资本，因为归根结底，资本还是要靠好感来的。他只能在芒德城里盘下一个事务所……可是内地人太不了解巴黎人的聪明，给我的朋友找了许许多多的麻烦……”

“那些坏蛋！”西卜女人插了一句。

“是的，因为他们勾结起来，一致和他过不去，竟找出一些好像是我朋友不对的事，逼他把事务所盘掉；检察官也出面干涉了，那官儿是地方上的人，当然偏袒同乡。我这可怜的朋友叫作弗莱齐埃，比我还穷，比我还穿得破烂，家里的排场跟我的一样，躲在我们这一区里只能在违警法庭和初级法庭辩护，因为他也是个律师。他住在珍珠街，就靠近这里。你到九号门牌，走上四楼，就可看到楼梯台上有块小红皮招牌，印着：弗莱齐埃事务所。他专门替本区的门房、工人、穷人办理诉讼，收费很便宜，人也很老实。因为凭他的本领，只要坏一坏良心，他早已高车大马地抖起来了。今天晚上我去看他。你赶明儿一清早去。他认得商务警察路夏先生，初级法庭的执达吏泰勃罗先生，初级法庭庭长维丹先生，公证人德洛浓先生；在街坊上那些吃公事饭的里面，他已经是一个重要角儿了。倘使他做了你的代理人，倘使你能劝邦斯先生请他做顾问，那就像你一个人变了两个人。可是你不能像跟我一样，向他提出那些有伤尊严的话。他非常聪明，你们一定谈得投机的。至于怎么酬谢他，我可以做中间人……”

西卜太太很俏皮地望着医生，说：“上回修院老街开针线铺的弗洛丽蒙太太，为了姘夫的遗产差点儿倒霉，后来一个吃法律饭的给她把事情挽回了，你的朋友是不是那个人？……”

“就是他。”

“哎，你说她可有良心？”西卜女人叫起来，“人家替她争到两千法郎年金，向她求婚，她倒不答应；听说结果只送了一打荷兰布衬衫，两打手帕，整套内衣，就算谢了他！”

“西卜太太，那些内衣值到一千法郎；那时弗莱齐埃在街坊上刚出头，也用得着衣衫。并且，一切代账她都照付，没有一句话……这件案子替弗莱齐埃招来了别的案子，现在他业务已经很忙，在我们眼里，大小主顾都是一样的……”

“唉，世界上吃苦的就是那些好人！”看门女人回答，“好吧，波冷先生，再见了，谢谢你。”

老鳏夫送命的惨剧，或者说可怕的喜剧，从此开场了。因缘凑合，他落在一般贪财的人手中，只能听他们摆布。还有最强烈的贪欲在那里推波助澜：一个是嗜画如命的犹太人；一个是贪狠无比的弗莱齐埃，你要看到他躲在老巢里的模样准会发抖呢；一个是无恶不作，只要能搅上一笔资本连犯罪也不怕的奥弗涅人。以上所述可以说是这出喜剧的开场白；至于重要的角儿，至此为止都已经登场了。

四十四、一个吃法律饭的


社会上的风俗往往很古怪，某些字的降级就是一个例子；要解释这个问题简直得写上几本书。你跟一个诉讼代理人通信而称呼他法律家，对他的侮辱就像写信给一个经营殖民地货色的大商人而称他为杂货商。上流社会的人照理应当懂得这些世故，因为他们的全身本领便是懂世故，可是他们之中还有很多不知道文学家这称呼对一个作者是最刻薄的羞辱。要说明语言的生命与死亡，最好以“先生”二字为例。Monsieur与Monseigneur是完全同样的意思，从前都是对诸侯贵族的称呼；可是Monsieur的sieur慢慢地变作了sire，sire现在只限于称呼王上，保留着“大人”的意义；至于Monsieur却是人人可用，仅仅是“先生”了。还有，Messire一词不多不少就是Monsieur的同义字，可是偶然有人在讣文上用了这个词，共和党的报纸就要大声疾呼，仿佛人家有意推翻平等似的。

各级法院的法官、书记、执达吏，民间的法学专家、律师、诉讼代理人、法律顾问、辩护人、代办讼务的经纪人，都是包括在秉公执法或徇私枉法的这个阶级里的。其中最低的两级是经纪人和法律家。经纪人俗称为公差，因为他们除了包办讼务以外，还临时替执达吏做见证，帮助执行，可以说是民事方面的业余刽子手。法律家却是这一行特有的轻蔑的称呼：司法界中的法律家，等于文艺界中的文学家[1]。法国每个行业，由于同行嫉妒的关系，必有一些轻蔑的行话，刻薄的名称。但法律家、文学家，用作多数的时候就没有羞辱意味，说出来决不会得罪人。从另一方面说，巴黎所有的职业，都有批末等角儿把他们的一行拉到跟街上的无业游民和平民一般高低。无论哪一区，总有几个法律家、经纪人，正如中央菜场必有些论星期放印子钱的；这些债主之于大银行，就好比弗莱齐埃之于诉讼代理人公会的会员。奇怪的是，平民阶级怕法律界的人，好像怕进时髦饭店一样；他们喝酒是上小酒店的，所以打官司也是找一般经纪人的。不管是什么阶级的人都只敢和同等地位的人打交道，这是不易之理。至于喜欢爬到上层去，站在高级的人前面不会自惭形秽，像菩玛希敢把那个想折辱他的王爷的表摔在地上的[2]，只有少数优秀分子或是暴发户，尤其那般善于脱胎换骨的人往往有精彩表现。

第二天清早六点，西卜太太在珍珠街上打量她未来的法律顾问弗莱齐埃大爷住的屋子。那种地方从前是中下阶级住的。一进门便是一条过道，底层有个门房，有个紫檀木匠的铺子，里边的小院子给工场和堆的货占去一大半；此外是过弄和楼梯道：墙壁受着硝石和潮气的剥蚀，仿佛整个屋子害着大麻风。

西卜太太直奔门房，发现西卜的同行是个鞋匠，家里有一个女人，两个年龄很小的孩子，住的屋子只有十英尺见方，窗子是靠天井的。西卜太太一经说明身份，通名报姓，提到了她诺曼底街的屋子以后，两位女人立刻谈得非常亲热。弗莱齐埃的看门女人正在替鞋匠和孩子们准备早点。两人闲扯了一刻钟，西卜女人便把话题拉到房客身上，提起那位吃法律饭的来了。

“我有点事找他商量；是他的朋友波冷医生给我介绍的。你认得波冷医生吗？”

“怎么不认识？”珍珠街上的看门女人回答，“我的小姐子害的喉头炎，便是他给治好的。”

“他也救过我的命，太太……这位弗莱齐埃先生是怎么样的人呢？”

“这个人哪，好太太，就是到月底人家不容易问他讨到信钱的[3]。”

聪明的西卜女人一听这句就明白了，她说：“不过穷人也可能是规规矩矩的。”

“对呀，”弗莱齐埃的看门女人回答，“咱们没有金没有银，连铜子也没有，可是咱们就没拿过人家一个小钱。”

西卜女人听到了自己的那套话。

“那么他是可以信托的了，是不是？”

“哦！天！弗莱齐埃先生要真肯帮忙的话，我听弗洛丽蒙太太说过，他是了不起的。”

“她靠他发了财，干吗不肯嫁给他呢？”西卜太太急不可待地问，“一个开小针线铺的女人，姘着一个老头儿，做律师太太还不算高升了吗？……”

“你问我干吗？”看门女人把西卜女人拉到走道里，“太太，你不是要上去看他吗？……好吧，你进了他的办公室就明白了。”

四十五、不大体面的屋子


楼梯是靠几扇临着小天井的拉窗取光的，你一走上去，就能知道除了房东和弗莱齐埃之外，别的房客都是干手工业的。溅满污泥的踏级有每个行业的标记，例如碎铜片、碎纽扣、零头零尾的花边和草绠等等。高头几层的学徒，在墙上涂些猥亵的漫画。看门女人的最后一句话，自然引起了西卜太太的好奇心，她决意先去请教一下波冷医生的朋友，且看印象如何，再决定是否把事情交给他办。

“梭伐太太怎么能服侍他的，有时我真想不过来。”看门女人跟在后面，把刚才的话加上一个注解。她又说：“我陪你上楼，因为要替房东送牛奶跟报纸去。”

到了二层阁上的第二层[1]，西卜太太在一扇怕人的门前站住了。不三不四的红漆，门钮四周五六寸宽的地方，都堆了一层半黑不黑的油腻；在漂亮公寓里，建筑师往往在锁孔上下钉一面镜子，免得日子久了留下手上的污迹。大门上的小门，像酒店冒充陈年老酒的瓶子一样糊满了泥巴，钉着草头花形的铁条，扎实的铰链，粗大的钉子，可以名副其实地叫作监狱的门。这些装配，只有守财奴或是在小报上骂人而与大众为敌的记者才想得出。楼梯上臭气扑鼻，一部分是从排泄脏水的铅管散布出来的。蜡烛的烟在楼梯顶上画满了乱七八糟的图案。门铃绳子的拉手是个肮脏的橄榄球，微弱的声音表示门铃已经开裂。总之，每样东西都跟这个丑恶的画面调和。西卜女人先听见笨重的脚声，上气不接下气的呼吸，显见是个大胖子女人；而后梭伐太太出现了。她像荷兰画家勃罗侯笔下的老妖婆，身高五英尺六英寸，脸盘像个当兵的，胡子比西卜女人的还要多，身子臃肿，胖得不正常了。她穿着件挺便宜的罗昂布衫，头上包着一块绸布，还用主人家收到的印刷品做芯子，绕成头发卷儿，耳上戴着一副车轮大的金耳环，活像地狱里守门的母夜叉。她拿着一只东凹西凸的有柄的白铁锅子，淌出来的牛奶使楼梯台上更多了一股味道，可是尽管酸溜溜得令人作呕，外边却也不大闻得到了。

“什么事啊，太太？”她一边问，一边恶狠狠地瞅着西卜女人，大概她觉得来客穿得太体面了。天生充血的眼睛，使她看起人来格外显得杀气腾腾。

“我来看弗莱齐埃先生，是他的朋友波冷医生介绍的。”

“请进来吧，太太。”梭伐太太忽然变得一团和气，证明她早知道要有这个清早上门的客人。

行了个像戏台上一样的礼，那个半男性的老妈子粗手粗脚地打开办公室的门，里边便是从前在芒德当过诉讼代理人的角色。这间临街的办公室，跟三等执达吏的办公室一模一样，文件柜的木料是黑不溜秋的，陈旧的案卷已经纸边出毛，吊下来的红穗子也显得可怜巴巴，文件夹看得出有耗子在上面打过滚，日积月累的尘埃把地板变作了灰色，天花板给烟熏黄了。壁炉架上的镜子模糊一片；烧火的壁炉架上，木柴寥寥可数；新货的嵌木座钟只值六十法郎，是向法院拍卖来的；两旁的烛台是锌制的，还冒充四不像的洛可可式，好几处的漆已经剥落，露出里面的金属。弗莱齐埃是一个矮小、干瘪、病态的男人，红红的脸上生满小肉刺，足见他血液不清，他还时时刻刻搔着右边的胳膊。假头发戴得偏向脑后，露出一个土黄色的脑壳，神气很可怕。他从一张铺着绿皮坐垫的穿藤椅上站起来，堆着笑脸，端过一张椅子，装着甜蜜的声音说道：

“是西卜太太吧，我想？……”

“是的，先生。”她平素大模大样的气概竟没有了。

很像门铃声的那种嗓音，和半绿不绿的眼睛里那道尖利的光，把西卜女人吓呆了。整个办公室都有弗莱齐埃的气息，仿佛里头的空气会传染似的。西卜太太这才明白干吗弗洛丽蒙太太没有做弗莱齐埃太太。

“波冷跟我提过你了，好太太。”弗莱齐埃故意用着装腔作势的声音，可是照旧的尖锐、单薄，像乡下人做的酒。

说到这儿，他把对襟便服的下摆拉了一下，遮住裹在破裤子里的瘦膝盖。那件印花布袍子破了好几处，棉花老实不客气地从里头钻出来，可是棉花的重量还老是把衣襟往两边敞开，露出一件颜色变黑了的法兰绒上衣。他有模有样地，把不听话的长袍紧了紧带子，显出他芦苇似的身腰，然后把两根像死冤家的弟兄般永远各自东西的木柴，拿火钳拨在一处；紧跟着他又心血来潮地想起了什么，站起身来叫了声：“梭伐太太！”

“怎么呢？”

“谁来我都不见。”

“哎唷！还要你交代！”不男不女的老妈子口气很强硬。

“她是我的老奶妈。”弗莱齐埃不好意思地向西卜女人解释。

“她还有很多奶水呢。”当年中央菜场的红角儿回答。

弗莱齐埃笑了笑，闩上了门，免得女管家再来打断西卜女人的心腹话。他坐下来，一刻不停地拉着衣摆，说道：“好吧，太太，把你的事讲给我听。你是我世界上独一无二的朋友介绍来的，你相信我得了……是的，你可以完全相信我！”

西卜太太直讲了半点钟，对方不插一句话：他那好奇的神气，活像一个年轻的兵听着老禁卫军里的老兵[2]说话。她的唠叨，在她对付邦斯的几幕里，我们已经领教过了。弗莱齐埃一声不出，态度恭顺，好像聚精会神地听着西卜女人瀑布似的拉扯，使存着疑心的看门女人，把多少丑恶的印象引起的戒惧也减少了几分。

四十六、律师的谈话是有代价的


其实弗莱齐埃那双满着黑点子的绿眼睛，正在研究他未来的当事人。赶到西卜女人把话说完，等他发表意见的时候，他忽然来了一阵咳呛，直呛得死去活来；他赶紧抓起一只搪瓷碗，把半碗药茶统统灌了下去。

看见门房女人对他不胜同情的样子，他便说：“亲爱的西卜太太，没有波冷，我早已死了；可是他会把我治好的……”

他仿佛把当事人说的话全忘了。她看着这样一个病人，只想快快离开。

弗莱齐埃却一本正经地接着说：“太太，凡是遗产问题，在进行之前，先得知道两件事。第一，它的数目值不值得我们费心；第二，继承人是谁。因为遗产是战利品，继承人是敌人。”

西卜女人便提到雷蒙诺克与玛古斯，说那两位精明的同党把收藏的画估到六十万法郎。

“他们愿不愿意出这个价钱买呢？……”弗莱齐埃问，“因为，你知道，咱们吃公事饭的是不相信画的。一张画不是只值两法郎的一块画布，就是值到十万法郎的一幅名画！而十万法郎的名画都是大家知道的，而且这些东西，有多大名气的，也常闹笑话。一位出名的银行家，收藏的画经多少人看过，捧过，刻过铜版。据说买进来陆续花了几百万……赶到他死了，人不是总得死吗？他真正的画只卖了二十万！所以我得见一见你说的那两位先生……现在再谈继承人吧。”

弗莱齐埃说完又摆起姿势，预备听她的了。她一提到加缪索庭长的名字，他便侧了侧脑袋，扮了个鬼脸，使西卜女人大为注意；她想从他脑门上，从那张丑恶的脸上，琢磨出一点意思，可是看了半天，只看到一个生意上所谓的木头脑袋。

“不错的，先生，”西卜太太重复一遍，“邦斯先生是加缪索庭长的亲舅舅，这个话他一天要跟我提十几回。做绸缎生意的老加缪索先生……”

“最近进了贵族院……”

“他的第一位太太是邦斯家的小姐，跟邦斯先生是嫡堂兄妹。”

“那么邦斯先生是加缪索庭长的堂舅舅……”

“什么也不是了，他们已经翻了脸。”

加缪索·特·玛维尔来到巴黎之前，在芒德地方法院当过五年院长。不但那儿还有人记得他，他还有朋友。他的后任便是他从前来往最密的推事，至今还在芒德任上，所以对弗莱齐埃的根底是再清楚没有的。

等到西卜女人终于把话匣子关上之后，弗莱齐埃说道：“太太，将来你的冤家，是个有力量把人送上断头台的家伙，你可知道？”

看门女人从椅子上直跳起来，活像那个叫作吓人的玩具[1]。

“你别慌，好太太。我不怪你不知道当巴黎法院控诉庭庭长的是什么角色；可是你应当知道，邦斯先生有个合法的继承人。玛维尔庭长是你病人的独一无二的继承人，不过是三等旁系亲族，所以照法律规定，邦斯先生可以自由处分他的财产。庭长先生的女儿，一个半月以前嫁给包比诺伯爵的大儿子，包比诺是贵族院议员，前任农商部长，目前政界上最有势力的一个。攀了这门亲，庭长先生的可怕，就不只因为他在重罪法庭上操着生杀之权了。”

西卜女人听到重罪法庭几个字又吓了一跳。

“是的，”弗莱齐埃接着说，“能把你送上重罪法庭的就是他。哎，太太，你可不知道什么叫作穿红袍的官儿呢！有个穿黑袍的跟你为难已经够受了[2]！你看我现在穷得一无所有，头也秃了，身子也弄坏了……唉，就因为我在内地无意中得罪了一个小小的检察官！他们逼我把事务所亏了本盘出，我能够丢了家私滚蛋，还觉得挺侥幸呢！要是跟他们硬一下，我连律师也当不成了。还有一点你不知道的，倘使只有一个加缪索庭长，倒还没有什么大不了；可是告诉你，他还有一位太太呢！……你要劈面见到她，包管你浑身哆嗦，连头发都会站起来，像踏上了断头台的梯子。一朝庭长太太跟谁结了仇，她会花上十年工夫布置一个圈套，教你送命！她调动她的丈夫像孩子玩陀螺一样。她曾经使一个挺可爱的男人在监狱里自杀；替一个被控假造文件罪的伯爵洗刷得干干净净。查理十世的宫廷中一位最显赫的爵爷，差点儿给她弄得褫夺公权。还有，检察署长葛郎维尔就是被她拉下台的……”

“可是那个住在修院老街，在圣·法朗梭阿街拐角上的？”西卜女人问。

“就是他。人家说她想要丈夫当司法部长，我看也不见得不成功……要是她有心把咱们俩送上重罪法庭，送进苦役监的话，我哪怕像初生的小娃娃一样纯洁，也要马上弄张护照往美国溜了……因为司法界的情形，我知道太清楚了。亲爱的西卜太太，我告诉你，为了把他们的独养女儿攀给包比诺子爵——据说他是你房东比勒洛先生的继承人——庭长太太把自己的财产都弄光了，现在只靠庭长的薪俸过日子。在这种情形之下，太太，你想庭长夫人对邦斯先生的遗产会不在乎吗？……哦，我宁可让大炮来轰我，也不愿意跟这样一个女人结冤家……”

“可是他们闹翻了啊……”西卜女人说。

“那有什么相干？就因为闹翻了，她才更不肯放手！把一个讨厌的亲戚送命是一回事，承继他的遗产是另一回事，那倒是一种乐趣呢！”

“可是老头儿恨死了他的继承人；他时时刻刻对我说，我还记得那些姓名呢，什么加陶、贝蒂哀……把他压扁了，像一车石子压一个鸡子似的。”

“你是不是也愿意给他们压扁呢？”

“天哪！天哪！”看门女人叫起来，“封丹太太说我要遇到阻碍，真是一点不错；可是她说我会成功的……”

“你听我说，亲爱的西卜太太……你要捞个三万两万是可能的；可是承继遗产哪，趁早别想……昨天晚上，我们把你跟你的事都讨论过了。我跟波冷两个……”

西卜太太又在椅子上直跳起来。

“哎，怎么啦？”

“既然你已经知道了我的事，干吗还让我嘁嘁喳喳地说上大半天呢？”

“西卜太太，你的事我是弄明白了，可是关于西卜太太，我一点儿不知道啊！一个当事人有一个当事人的脾气……”

听了这句话，西卜太太对她未来的法律顾问极不放心地瞅了一眼，被弗莱齐埃注意到了。

四十七、弗莱齐埃的用意


“还有，”弗莱齐埃又道，“我们的朋友波冷，承你介绍给包比诺伯爵夫人的舅公比勒洛，这也是一个理由使我愿意替你尽心出力。波冷每半个月去看一次你的房东，（听见没有？）所有的细节都是从那边知道的。那位告老的商人，参加了他外甥曾孙女的婚礼，（因为他是个有遗产的舅太公，每年大概有一万五进款，二十五年的生活像个修道士，一年难得花上三千法郎……）他把庭长女儿出嫁的事全告诉了波冷。听说那次吵架就是因为你那个音乐家为了报仇，想教庭长家里丢人。我们不能只听一面之词……你的病人说他一点错儿都没有，可是人家都说他是坏人……”

“说他坏人我才不奇怪呢！”西卜女人叫道，“你可想得到，十年工夫我把自己的钱放了进去，他也知道我的积蓄都借给了他，可不肯把我写上遗嘱……真的，先生，他不肯，他一味地死心眼儿，的的确确是匹骡子……我和他说了十天，老家伙像块路旁的界石，一动也不动。他咬紧牙关不开口。望着我的神气真像……末了他只说一句话，就是把我交托给许模克先生。”

“那么他是想把许模克立为他的继承人喽？”

“他预备把什么都送给他……”

“亲爱的西卜太太，要我得到个结论，订一个计划，我先得认识许模克，亲眼看到那些成为遗产的东西，跟你说的犹太人当面谈一谈；那时，你再听我的调度……”

“慢慢再说吧，弗莱齐埃先生。”

“怎么慢慢再说！”弗莱齐埃对西卜女人毒蛇似的扫了一眼，说话也恢复了他原来的嗓子，“嗯！我是你的顾问不是你的顾问？咱们先说说明白。”

西卜女人觉得自己的心事给他猜到了，不由得背脊发冷。眼看落在了老虎手里，她只得说：“我完全相信你。”

“我们做诉讼代理人的老吃当事人的亏。哎，仔细看看你的情形吧，真是太好了。倘使你每一步都听我的话做去，我保证你在这笔遗产里头捞到三万四万法郎……可是这个美丽的远景有正面也有反面。假定庭长太太知道了邦斯先生的遗产值一百万，知道了你想把它啃掉一角的话……”说到这儿他顿了一顿，“因为这一类的事总有人去报告她的！……”

这个插句使西卜女人打了个寒噤，她马上想到弗莱齐埃就是会出头告密的人。

“那么，亲爱的当事人，不消十分钟，人家就会教比勒洛把你看门的饭碗给砸了，限你两个钟点搬家……”

“那我才不怕呢！……”西卜女人像罗马战神般直站起来，“我就跟定了两位先生，做他们亲信的管家。”

“好，你这样是不是？人家就安排一个圈套，让你夫妇俩一觉醒来，身子都进了监牢，担了个天大的罪名……”

“我！……”西卜女人直嚷起来，“我从来没有拿过人家一个生丁！……我！……我！……”

她一口气讲了五分钟，弗莱齐埃却在那儿把这个自吹自捧的大艺术家细细推敲，神气又冷静又刻薄，眼睛像匕首似的钉着西卜女人，他在肚里暗笑，干瘪的假头发在那儿微微抖动。他的模样仿佛吟诗作文时代的罗伯斯庇尔[1]。

“怎么可能？为了什么？有什么理由？”她结束的时候这样问。

“你要知道你的脑袋怎么会搬家吗？……”

西卜女人脸色白得像死人一样地坐了下去，听到这句话，好似断头台上的铡刀已经搁在她的脖子上。她迷迷糊糊地瞪着弗莱齐埃。

“你仔细听我说。”弗莱齐埃看了当事人的惊吓非常满意，可是忍着不表示出来。

“那我宁可什么都不要了……”西卜女人喃喃地说着，预备站起来了。

“别走，因为你应当知道你的危险，我也应当点醒你，”弗莱齐埃俨然地说，“你得给比勒洛先生撵走，那是一定的，可不是？你做了两位先生的老妈子，好吧，很好！那表示你跟庭长太太开火了。你，你想不顾一切，好歹要弄到这笔遗产……”

西卜女人做了个手势，弗莱齐埃却回答说：“我不责备你，那不是我的事儿。可是夺家私就等于打仗，你会拦不住自己！一个人有了个主意，头脑会发昏的，只知道狠命地干……”

西卜太太挺了挺腰板，又做了个否认的手势。

“得了吧，得了吧，老妈妈，”弗莱齐埃很不客气地用了这样的称呼，“你会下毒手的……”

“哦呀，你把我当作贼吗？”

“别嚷，老妈妈，你没有花多大本钱就拿到了许模克一张借票……哎！美丽的太太，你在这儿就像在忏悔室里一样……别欺骗你的忏悔师，尤其他能够看到你的心……”

西卜女人被这个家伙的明察秋毫骇坏了，同时也明白了为什么他从头至尾对她的话听得那么留神。

“可是，”弗莱齐埃接着说，“你得承认在这个抢遗产的竞赛里头，庭长太太决不肯让你占先的……他们要看着你，暗中盯着你……你教邦斯先生把你名字写上遗嘱是不是？……好得很。可是有一天，警察上门了，搜到一杯药茶，发现有砒霜；你跟你的丈夫被逮走了，上了公堂，判了罪，认为你想毒死邦斯，得他的遗产……我曾经在凡尔赛替一个可怜的女人辩护，就像你那样顶着个莫须有的罪名，案情也跟我刚才说的一样，我那时只能做到救她的性命为止。可怜虫给判了二十年苦役，如今就在圣·拉查监狱执行。”

这时西卜女人恐惧到了极点。她面无人色，瞧着这个绿眼睛矮身量的干瘪男人，活像可怜的摩尔女子被判火刑的时候望着异教裁判官。

“好先生，你说只要把事情交给你，让你来照顾我的利益，我可以弄到一笔钱，什么都不用害怕，是不是？”

“我担保你弄到三万法郎。”弗莱齐埃表示十拿九稳。

“再说，你知道我多么敬重波冷医生，”她把声音装得很甜，“是他劝我来看你的，那好人并没教我到这儿来听到这种话，说我要给人家当作谋财害命的凶手送上断头台……”

说到这儿她哭起来了。她想着断头台就发抖，神经受了震动，恐怖揪住了她的心，顿时没了主意。弗莱齐埃对着自己的胜利大为得意。他看到当事人犹疑不决，以为这桩生意吹了，因此他要制服西卜女人，恐吓她，唬住她，把她收拾得服服帖帖，缚手缚脚地听他摆布。看门女人进到屋子里来，像一只苍蝇投入了蜘蛛网，只能粘在上面，听人捆缚，给这个吃法律饭的小家伙当作食料，实现他的野心。的确，弗莱齐埃把自己的舒服、幸福、地位、老年的口粮，都算在这件案子的账上。隔天晚上，他和波冷两人深思熟虑，把什么都掂过斤量，仔细地，像用了放大镜似的，检讨过。医生把许模克的为人描述给他的朋友弗莱齐埃听，两个精明强干的人一同把各种可能、各种方法、各种危险都琢磨过了。弗莱齐埃一时高兴起来，嚷道：“这一下咱们俩的运道可来了！”他说波冷可以在巴黎当个医院的主任医师，他自己要做本区的初级法庭庭长。

对这个能干的角色，鞋袜不全的法学博士，初级法庭庭长的职位仿佛不容易骑上去的神龙怪兽，心中念念不忘的对象，犹如当选为议员的律师想着司法部长的长袍，意大利的神父想着教皇的冠冕。简直想得发疯了！初级法庭庭长维丹先生，是个六十九岁的老头儿，病歪歪的，已经说要告老了。弗莱齐埃平日就在维丹庭上辩护；他常常跟波冷提到想接替这位置，正如波冷向他说希望救了一个危险的女病人而娶她做太太。一切巴黎的职位有多少人追逐，是我们意想不到的。住在巴黎是普遍一致的愿望。只要卖烟草卖印花税票的零售店有一个空额[2]，上百的女人会奋臂而起，发动全体亲友为自己钻谋。巴黎二十四处捐税稽征所有一处可能出缺的话，众议院里就得给那些野心家搅得满城风雨！那些缺分都得开会来决定，发表的时候是一件国家大事。巴黎初级法庭庭长，年薪是六千法郎左右。可是初级法庭一个书记官的职位就值到十万法郎[3]。所以那是司法界中人人眼红的差事。弗莱齐埃，当了初级法庭庭长，结了一门有钱的亲，把朋友波冷医生安插到医院里当主任，也设法给他结婚；他们俩就预备这样有来有往地互相汲引。

四十八、西卜女人中了自己的计


芒德的从前诉讼代理人睡了一夜，主意更坚决了，一个复杂的大计划已经有了眉目，这计划不知要用到多少阴谋，也不知会有多么丰富的收获。西卜女人是这出戏的关键。所以这个工具的倔强非制服不可；弗莱齐埃没有防到这一着，可是他尽量发挥他阴险的本性，居然把大胆的看门女人打倒在脚下。

“得了吧，亲爱的西卜太太，你不用怕。”他抓着她的手说。

他那只跟蛇皮一般冷的手，使看门女人有股可怕的感觉，生理上有了反应，精神上的激动倒反停止了。她觉得碰到这个戴着土红色的假头发，说话像房门咿咿呀呀怪叫的家伙，等于碰到了一个毒药瓶，比封丹太太的癞蛤蟆还要危险。弗莱齐埃看见西卜女人表示厌恶的姿势，便接着说：

“别以为我平白无故地恐吓你。使庭长太太凶恶出名的几桩案子，法院里无人不晓，你去打听就是了。差点倒霉的爵爷是哀斯巴侯爵。靠她的力量而没有进苦役监的是哀斯葛里浓侯爵。那个又漂亮又有钱的年轻人，正在跟法国门第最高的一位小姐攀亲的时候，吊死在监狱里的，是吕西安·特·鲁邦泼莱，那件案子当时曾经轰动巴黎。事情还是为的遗产，大名鼎鼎的哀斯丹小姐，死下来有几百万，人家控告吕西安说他把她毒死了，因为哀斯丹在遗嘱上指定他做继承人。可是那女人死的时候，风流公子根本不在巴黎，也不知道自己是继承人……这不是证明他毫无干系吗？……不料被加缪索审了一堂之后，吕西安在监狱里吊死了。[1]……法律跟医学一样有它的牺牲者。为法律死的是为社会牺牲；为医学死的是为科学牺牲。”说到这里，他很瘆人地惨笑了一下，“再说我自己不是尝过了危险吗？……我这可怜的无名小子，已经给法律把家私弄光了。我的经验花了很高的代价，现在我就拿这个经验给你当差……”

“哦！谢谢你，不用费心了……”西卜女人说，“我什么都不要了！那我要变作忘恩负义的人……我原来只是要我应该有的一份！先生，我清白了三十年呢！邦斯先生说过，他会在遗嘱上把我托付给他的朋友许模克的；好吧，我将来就依靠那好心的德国人养老吧……”

弗莱齐埃的耍手段耍得过火了，西卜女人灰了心，他不得不把她所受的惊吓设法消除。

“别泄气，”他说，“你安心回家，咱们会把事情调动得挺好的。”

“那么，好先生，我该怎么办才能够得到年金而不……”

“不至于后悔是不是？”他赶紧接过西卜女人的话，“哎！就因为要做到这一点，世界上才有吃法律饭的人！在这种情形之下，一个人不守法律的范围，什么都不能拿……你不懂法律，我懂……有了我，你就每样事都合法了，尽可以太太平平地捞进一笔，不怕人家干涉；至于良心，那是你自己的事。”

“那么你说啊，应当怎么办？”西卜女人听了这几句，觉得又好奇又安慰。

“现在我还不能告诉你，我没有考虑到用什么手段，只研究了事情的阻碍。第一，要逼他立遗嘱，你不能走错一步；可是最要紧的，先得打听出邦斯预备把遗产送给谁，因为倘使你是他的继承人的话……”

“不会的，不会的，他不喜欢我！啊！我要早知道他的小玩意儿值那么多钱，早知道他没有什么私生子，今天我也不会着急了……”

“管他，你干就是了！”弗莱齐埃接着说，“快死的病人念头没有准儿的；亲爱的西卜太太，要对他存着希望是常常会落空的。让他立了遗嘱，我们再看着办。可是最要紧的是先估一估遗产的价值。所以你得让我见见犹太人和那个雷蒙诺克，我们用得着这两个……你完全相信我吧，我替你尽心出力。对当事人我是赤胆忠心的朋友，只要他也拿我当朋友。我的脾气干脆得很，不是朋友便是敌人。”

“那么我完全拜托你了，至于酬金，波冷先生……”

“这话甭提。你只要不让病人逃出波冷先生的手掌；这医生真是太老实太纯洁了，我从来没见过那样的人；你知道，在病人身边我们必须有个心腹……波冷的心比我好，我这个人变得凶起来了。”

“我也觉得你有点儿凶，可是我相信你……”

“你这是不错的……出点儿小事就得来找我，行啦……你是聪明人，将来一切都顺当的。”

“再见，亲爱的弗莱齐埃先生；希望你恢复健康……”

弗莱齐埃把当事人送到门口，然后，像她前一天晚上对付波冷医生一样，他也和她说出了最后一句话：“要是你能劝邦斯先生请我做顾问，事情就更有希望了。”

“我一定去劝他。”

弗莱齐埃把西卜女人重新拉进办公室，说道：“告诉你，老妈妈，我跟德洛浓先生很熟，他是本区的公证人。要是邦斯自己没有公证人，你跟他提起这一个……最好劝他请德洛浓。”

“我懂了。”

看门女人走出去的时候，听见衣衫的窸窣声，和特意想走得轻而提着足尖的沉重的脚声。在街上走了一程，她头脑方始清醒过来。虽然还受着这次谈话的影响，虽然还非常怕断头台、法律、法官等等，她的挺自然的反应，是决意跟她可怕的顾问不声不响地斗一斗。

“哼！干吗我要招些股东老板呢？”她心里想，“我捞我的；以后哪，我帮了他们的忙，再拿他们一笔酬劳……”这个念头把可怜音乐家的命送得更快了。

四十九、西卜女人上戏院去


西卜太太跑进两位老人家里，“喂，亲爱的许模克先生，咱们的宝贝病人怎么啦？”

“不行哪，邦斯整夜都在说胡话。”

“说些什么呢？”

“都是瞎扯！他要我把他的财产统统拿下来，条件是一样东西也不替他卖掉……可怜的人！他哭得我难过死了！”

“慢慢会好的。现在已经九点，你的早饭给耽误了；可是别埋怨我……你知道，为了你们，我忙得很。家里一个子儿都没有了，我在张罗钱呢！……”

“怎么张罗？”德国人问。

“长生库啰！”

“什么？”

“当铺啰！”

“当铺？”

“哦！你这个好人！这样老实！你真是一个圣人，一个天使。怎么！你在巴黎住了二十九年，经过了七月革命，看见了多多少少的事，还不知道什么叫作当铺……拿你的衣服杂物去押钱的地方！……我把我们的银餐具，八套刻花的，都送了去。没关系！西卜可以用喷银的，反正一样体面，像那个戏子说的。你别跟咱们的宝贝病人提，他会发急的，脸更要黄了，没有这些他已经烦死了。咱们先把他救过来，旁的事以后再说。紧急的时候只能咬紧牙关，不是吗？……”

“好太太，你真了不起！”可怜的德国人抓着西卜女人的手按在自己胸口，神气很感动。他含着一包眼泪望着天。

“别这样，许模克老头，你真可笑。这不是过分了吗？我这个人是老老实实的，什么都摆在脸上。你瞧，我就是有这个，”她拍了拍心窝，“你们两个心地好，我可是跟你们一样……”

“唉，许模克老头吗！……”德国人接着说，“他伤透了心，哭出了血泪，上天堂去，这是许模克的命！邦斯死了，我也活不成的……”

“对啦！我知道，你是不要命了……听我说，小狗子……”

“小狗子？”

“那么小鬼……”

“小鬼？”

“那么小东西好不好？”

“你越说我越糊涂了……”

“好吧，你听着，你得让我来照顾你，听我的安排；要不然，你这样下去，我要背上两个病人了……我看哪，咱们这儿的工作得分配一下。你不能再东奔西跑地去教书，把你弄得筋疲力尽，回家来什么事都干不了；邦斯先生的病越来越重，晚上得守着他。我想今儿挨门挨户去通知你的学生，说你病了……那么你晚上陪着病人，早上五点到下午两点可以睡觉。最吃力的活儿归我来，就是说白天由我值班，我要管你的中饭、晚饭，服侍病人，抱他起来，替他换衣服，给他吃药……照我过去做的那些事，我顶多再撑十天。咱们不顾死活地已经熬了三十天。要是我病倒了，你们怎么办？……还有你哪，也叫人担心，这一夜没有睡，你自己去瞧瞧还像个样吗……”

她把许模克拉到镜子前面，许模克发觉自己的确改变了很多。

“所以，倘使你赞成我的办法，我马上去弄早饭给你吃。你陪着病人，陪到下午两点。你把主顾的名单抄下来，我很快就能办妥，那你可有半个月假期了。等我回来，你就能一觉睡到晚上。”

这个提议非常合理，许模克一口答应了。

“对邦斯先生一个字都不能提；因为，你知道，倘若我们告诉他，把他在戏院里和教书的事统统停起来，他要觉得没希望了。可怜的先生会想他的学生都要跑掉了……这不是胡闹吗？……波冷医生说的，咱们非得让他十二分安静，才能把他救过来。”

“啊！好，好！你去弄早饭，我在这儿抄地名。……你说得不错，我也会病倒的！”

一小时以后，西卜女人穿扮得非常齐整，坐着马车（雷蒙诺克见了大吃一惊），决意体体面面地，以亲信的管家身份，代表两个榛子钳到那些私塾和家庭中去。

她到一处都大同小异地拉扯一番，在此也不必细述；我们单说她好容易踏进高狄沙经理室的那一幕。巴黎的戏院经理，门禁比王上和部长的都更森严。理由很简单：王上他们只要防备人家的野心；戏院经理还得防备演员和作家们的自尊心。

西卜女人的冲破禁卫，是因为她能三言两语地马上跟门房亲热。像任何一业的同行一样，看门的彼此都一见便知的。每行有每行的暗号，正如每行有每行的咒骂和伤疤。

“啊！太太，原来你是戏院的门房，”西卜女人说，“我不过是诺曼底街一个可怜的看门女人。你们的乐队指挥邦斯先生就住在我屋子里。哦！你好福气，天天看到一般戏子、舞女和作家！这才像那个有名的戏子说的，是我们一行中的大元帅呢。”

“他怎么啦，那位多好的邦斯先生？”对方问。

“不行哪；已经两个月没下床，将来只能直着两腿给抬出去的了，一定的。”

“那多可惜……”

“可不是！我今天代他向你们的经理说说他的情形；劳驾想个法儿，让我见一见经理。”

戏院里的当差受了门房嘱托，进去通报道：“有位太太是邦斯先生派来的。”

高狄沙为了排戏刚到戏院。碰巧那时没有人找他，作家和演员都到迟了；听到有他乐队指挥的消息，他很高兴，便做了个拿破仑式的手势。于是西卜女人进去了。





五十、生意兴隆的戏院


这个跑街出身的家伙当了时髦戏院的经理，把股东当作正室太太一样地欺骗。发了财，身体也跟着发福了。又胖又结实，山珍海味，日进斗金，把他调养得满脸红光。高狄沙一变而为暴发户了。

“咱们面团团的快像银行家蒲雄了。”他自嘲自讽地说。

“我看你倒像那个市侩丢加拉。”皮克西渥回答。在戏院的头牌舞女、鼎鼎大名的哀络依思·勃里斯多那里，皮克西渥是常常替高狄沙做代表的。

高狄沙的经营戏院，目的是专为替自己拼命捞钱。他先想法把几出芭蕾舞剧、杂剧，算作自己出的主意，拿到一半的上演权；而后，等老是叫穷的作家要用钱的时候，把另外一半上演权也买过来。除此以外，再加上一些走红的戏，他每天都有好几块金洋上袋。他叫人出面拿黑票做生意；又公开地拿一部分戏票算作经理的津贴。这是高狄沙三项主要的收入。另外他私卖包厢，收受起码演员的贿赂；她们只要能扮些小角色，例如侍从或王后等等就满足了。所以他三分之一的股份，实际的收入还不止这个比例，而别的三分之二的股权只分到盈余的十分之一。可是这十分之一也还合到分半利息，高狄沙根据这分半红利，自夸自赞地说自己如何调度有方，如何热心，如何诚实，而股东们又如何运气。

包比诺伯爵带着关切的神气问玛蒂法、克勒凡、玛蒂法的女婿古罗将军对高狄沙满意不满意，进了贵族院的古罗回答说：“人家说他欺骗我们，可是他那么风趣，那么好脾气，我们也觉得满意了……”

“那倒像拉·封丹的小说了[1]。”前任部长笑着说。

戏院之外，高狄沙还做别的投资。他认为葛拉夫、希华勃和勃罗纳的公司挺不错，跟他们合伙办铁路。他不露出自己的精明，只一味装作随便、洒脱、爱女人，仿佛只想寻欢作乐，讲究穿扮，其实他每件事都想到，拿出他跑街时期的经验尽量应用。这玩世不恭的暴发户，住着一所场面阔绰，一切都由他的建筑师安排的屋子，常在那儿大开筵席，请名流吃消夜。喜欢排场，喜欢讲究，他表面上做人很随和，说起话来，除了从前跑街的一套又加上后台的切口，使人家更不防他有什么城府。干戏剧的人讲话虽然毫无忌讳，却也另有风趣；高狄沙拿这些后台的风趣，和跑惯码头的人粗野的笑话混在一起，自命不凡。那时他正想把戏院让给人家，找点别的玩意儿换换口味。他希望当个铁路公司的经理，做个正经商人，娶一个巴黎最有钱的区长的女儿，弥娜小姐。他也希望靠着铁路局当选议员，再仗着包比诺的势力当参议官。

“这一位是谁呀？”高狄沙拿出经理气派瞧着西卜女人。

“先生，我是邦斯先生亲信的管家。”

“哦，他怎么啦，这个好人？”

“不行，很不行，先生。”

“要命！要命！我听了真不高兴……我要去看看他，像他这样的人是少有的。”

“嗳，是啊，先生，真是个天使……我奇怪他怎么会在戏院里做事的……”

“告诉你，太太，戏院是改好一个人品性的地方……可怜的邦斯！……真的，世界上就少不得这等人……简直是个模范，并且还有才气！你想他什么时候可以来上班呢？因为戏院跟驿车一样，不管有客没客，到了钟点就得开……一到下午六点，这儿还能不开场吗？……我们尽管同情人家，可没法变出好音乐来……你说，他究竟怎么啦？”

“唉，我的好先生，”西卜女人掏出手帕来掩着眼睛，“说来可怕，他是靠不住的了，虽然我们把他服侍得千周到万周到，我跟许模克先生两个……我还得告诉你，连许模克也暂时不能来了，他每天要守夜……我们不能不死马当作活马医，想尽方法救他……医生对他已经没希望了……”

“怎么会呢？”

“哦，又是伤心事，又是黄疸病，又是肝病，还加上好多亲戚之间的纠葛，复杂得很。”

“再加上一个医生，当然更糟了，”高狄沙说，“他应当找我们戏院里的特约医生，勒勃仑先生，又不用他花一个钱……”

“现在看邦斯先生的那个人，好得跟上帝一样；可是病这么复杂，医生本领再好也没用。”

“我正用得着这两个榛子钳，为我那出新排的神幻剧……”

“可不可以让我来代他们做呢？……”西卜女人的神气天真到极点。

高狄沙不禁哈哈大笑。

“先生，我是他们亲信的管家，替两位先生做好多事呢……”

这时门外忽然有个女人的声音：“朋友，既然你在笑，我可以进来吧？”说话的便是挂头牌的舞女，哀络依思·勃里斯多，她披着一条鲜艳夺目，叫作阿基里安的披肩，闯进经理室，往独一无二的长沙发上坐了下来。

“你笑什么？……是不是这位太太逗你发笑的？她预备来扮什么角儿？……”她瞧着西卜女人，像演员打量另外一个将来要登台的演员。

哀络依思是个极有文学气息的姑娘，在艺术界中颇有声名，跟一般大艺术家有来往，长得体面、细巧、妩媚，比普通的头牌舞女要聪明得多。她一边问一边拿着个香炉闻着。

“太太，所有的女人只要长得漂亮，就没有什么高低，虽然我不去闻什么瓶里的臭气，腮帮上不涂什么灰土……”

“凭你这副尊容，涂上去不是多余了吗，我的孩子！”哀络依思对她的经理挤了挤眼睛。

“我是个规规矩矩的女人……”

“那算你倒霉。要有男人肯养你，也不是容易的事！我可是办到了，太太，而且觉得挺舒服呢！”

“怎么算我倒霉！”西卜女人说，“你尽管披着阿基里安装模作样，也是白的！你又听到过多少爱情话，太太？你能跟蓝钟饭店的牡蛎美人比吗？……”

舞女猛地站起来立正，举起右手行了个敬礼，像小兵对他的将军一样。

“什么！”高狄沙嚷道，“我听父亲说起的牡蛎美人，敢情就是你？”

“那么西班牙舞，卜尔加舞，太太是完全不懂的了？太太已经五十出头了！”哀络依思说着，摆了个舞台上的姿势，念出那句有名的诗[2]：咱们做个朋友吧，西那！

“得了，哀络依思，太太不是你的对手，别逗着她玩了。”

“太太就是新哀络依思吗[3]？……”西卜女人假装很天真。

“有意思，这老婆子！”高狄沙叫着。

“这个双关语已经过时了，”舞女回答，“它已经长了胡子啦，老太太，你再想个旁的吧……要不然请你抽一支卷烟。”

“对不起，太太，我太伤心了，没有心绪再回答你；我有两位先生病得很重……为了给他们吃饱，免得他们发急，今天早上我连自己丈夫的衣服都拿去当了，你看这张当票……”

“啊唷！这么严重！是怎么回事呢？”漂亮的哀络依思问。

“太太，”西卜女人接着说，“你闯进来的时候真像……”

“真像挂头牌的红角儿。我来替你提示，太太，你说下去吧。”

“得了吧，我忙得很，别胡扯了，”高狄沙插嘴道，“哀络依思，这位太太是咱们乐队指挥的管家，他快死了；她来告诉我，对他不能再存什么希望，这一下我可糟啦。”

“哦！可怜的人！咱们应当替他演一场义务戏。”

“那会教他闹亏空的！义务戏收支不相抵的时候，他还得欠慈善会五百法郎捐税。他们除了自己养的穷人，不承认巴黎还有别的人需要救济。好吧，太太，既然你这样热心，预备得蒙底翁道德奖……”

高狄沙说着，按了铃，马上来了个当差。

“去通知出纳课，支一千法郎给我。太太，你坐下吧。”

“哦，可怜的女人，她哭了……”舞女嚷道，“看她傻不傻！……得了吧，老妈妈，我们会去看他的，别难过了。——喂，你啊，”她把经理拉过一边，“你一方面要我当《阿里安纳》舞剧的主角；一方面想把我丢掉，想结婚。告诉你，我能跟你捣乱的！……”

“哀络依思，我的心重得很，像条巡洋舰。”

“我会向人家借几个孩子来，说是你跟我生的！”

“咱们的关系我已经声明过了……”

“你客气一些好不好？把邦斯的位置给了迦朗育吧，那穷小子很有本领；你答应了，我就饶你。”

“那也得等邦斯死了以后……他说不定还能逃过一关呢。”

“哦，先生，他逃不过的了……”西卜女人插嘴道，“从昨天晚上起，他已经神志不清，说胡话了。可怜他是不久的了。”

“反正你可以让迦朗育先代理一下！”哀络依思说，“所有的报纸都肯替他捧场……”

这时出纳员走进来，拿着两张五百法郎的钞票。

“交给这位太太，”高狄沙吩咐，“再见吧，好太太；你去好好地侍候病人，告诉他，我会去看他的，明天或是后天，只要我有空……”

“他是完蛋了，”哀络依思说。

“哦！先生，像你这样大慈大悲的心肠，只有戏院里有。但愿上帝保佑你！”

“这一笔怎么出账呢？”出纳员问。

“归入津贴项下。等会我签传票给你。”

西卜女人向舞女行着礼出去之前，听见高狄沙问他旧日的情妇：

“咱们的芭蕾舞剧《莫希耿》的音乐，迦朗育能不能在十二天之内赶起来？他要能替我解决这个困难，就让他接邦斯的位置！”

五十一、空中楼阁


看门女人做了那么多坏事，反而比做善事得到更大的酬报。她把两位朋友的收入完全割断，连他们的生计也给断绝了，要是邦斯病好的话。这个卑鄙的勾当使西卜女人几天之内就如愿以偿，把埃里·玛古斯觊觎的几张画卖了出去。为要抢到这第一批东西，她不得不把自己找来的奸刁的同党弗莱齐埃给蒙蔽起来，教玛古斯和雷蒙诺克严守秘密。

至于奥弗涅人，他渐渐地抱了无知识的人所有的那种欲望。他们从偏僻的内地跑到巴黎来：一方面，乡居的孤独生活使他们有了个念头永远放不开；另一方面，原始性格的愚昧和暴烈的欲望，又化为许多执着的念头。西卜太太那种阳性的美，那种轻快活泼，那种菜市上的风趣，成为旧货商垂涎的目标，使他很想从西卜手中把她偷上手。在巴黎下等社会中，这一类一妇二夫的情形是很普遍的。可是贪心好比一个套结，把人的心越套越紧，结果把理智闭塞了。雷蒙诺克估计他跟玛古斯两人付的佣金大概有四万法郎，胸中的邪念便一变而为犯罪的动机，竟想人财两得，把西卜女人正式娶过来了。抱着这种纯粹投机性质的爱情，他靠在门上，抽着烟斗，老半天的胡思乱想之下，只盼望裁缝早死。那么他的资本可以变成三倍，而西卜女人做起买卖来又何等能干，坐在大街上体面的铺子里又何等妖艳。这双重的贪欲使雷蒙诺克迷了心窍。他要在玛特兰纳大街租一个铺面，摆着从邦斯的收藏里拿来的最美的古董。夜里做着金色的梦，烟斗里的缕缕青烟都变作成千累万的洋钱：不料他一觉醒来，正当打开铺门，摆出商品的时候，就看到矮小的裁缝扫着院子和大门口；因为从邦斯病倒以后，西卜女人的职司都由丈夫在代理。那时奥弗涅人便觉得这个橄榄色的、黄铜色的、骨瘦如柴的、矮小的裁缝，是他的幸福的唯一的障碍，而盘算着怎么样解决他了。这股越来越热烈的痴情，西卜女人看了非常得意，因为到了她的年纪，所有的女人都明白自己是会老的了。

因此有一天早上，西卜女人起身之后，若有所思地打量着雷蒙诺克，看他在那里摆出他的小玩意儿；她很想探探他的爱情究竟到什么程度。

“哎，你的事情顺当吗？”奥弗涅人问她。

“倒是你叫我不放心，”西卜女人回答，“你要害我了，你那种鬼鬼祟祟的眼睛，早晚要给邻居们发觉的。”她说完了便走出过道，溜到奥弗涅人铺子的尽里头。

“你哪儿来的这种古怪念头？”雷蒙诺克说。

“你来，我有话跟你讲。邦斯先生的继承人要忙起来了，会跟咱们捣乱的。天知道将来出些什么事，要是他们派些吃法律饭的来到处乱搅，像猎狗一样。要我教许模克卖几张画给你，先得看你对我真心不真心，能不能把事情保守秘密……哦，就是把你脑袋砍下来也不能哼一个字……既不说出画是哪儿来的，也不说是谁卖给你的。你知道，邦斯先生死了，埋了，人家来点他的画，六十七张只剩了五十三张的时候，那可跟谁都不相干……并且，邦斯先生在世的时候卖了画，谁也管不着。”

“好吧，”雷蒙诺克回答，“我不在乎；可是玛古斯先生是要正式的发票的。”

“急什么！你的发票也照样给你！……不是许模克先生给你凭据，难道是我给吗？……可是你得告诉犹太人，要他跟你一样地守秘密。”

“放心，咱们做哑巴就是了。干我们这一行的，嘴巴都紧得很。我吗，我认得字，可不能写，所以我要一个像你这样又有教育又能干的女人！……我一心只想挣一笔老年的口粮，生几个小雷蒙诺克……嗳，你把西卜丢了吧！”

“呦！你那个犹太人来啦，咱们好把事情谈妥了。”

“喂，我的好太太，事情怎么样啦？”玛古斯每三天都在清早来一次，打听什么时候能买他的画。

“没有人跟你提到邦斯先生和他的小玩意儿吗？”西卜女人问他。

“我收到一个律师的信；可是我觉得他是个坏蛋，是个起码掮客；我一向提防这种人，所以没理他。隔了三天他上门来留了一张片子；我吩咐门房，他要再来总回他一个不在家……”

“哎啊，你真是一个好犹太人，”西卜女人当然不会知道玛古斯那种谨慎的作风，“就在这几天，我来想法教许模克卖七八张画给你们，至多十张。可是有两个条件。第一要绝对守秘密。先生，你得承认你是许模克找来的。你来买画是雷蒙诺克介绍的。不管怎么样，反正跟我不相干。你出四万六买四张画，是不是？……”

“行吧。”犹太人叹了口气。

“好。第二个条件是你得给我四万三，你只拿三千法郎给许模克；雷蒙诺克出二千法郎也买他四张，把多下来的钱给我……可是告诉你，玛古斯先生，将来我可以让你和雷蒙诺克做到一桩好买卖，只要你答应赚了钱咱们三个人均分。我带你去看那个律师，或者他会到这儿来的。你把邦斯先生家里所有的东西估一个价钱，估一个你愿意买进的价钱，让弗莱齐埃切实知道遗产的价值。可是我们的交易没做成以前，决不能让他来，明白没有？……”

“明白了，”犹太人回答，“可是要仔细看过东西，估个价钱，是很费时间的呢。”

“你可以有半天工夫。你甭管，那是我的事……你们两位把事情商量一下，后天咱们就来做交易。我要去找弗莱齐埃谈谈，因为这儿的事，波冷医生都会告诉他的，嗬！要这个家伙不多嘴可不容易呢。”

在诺曼底街到珍珠街的半路上，西卜女人碰到弗莱齐埃上她那儿来了，他急于要知道详细的案由，照他的说法。

“呦，我正要去找你呀。”她说。

弗莱齐埃抱怨玛古斯没有接见他，看门女人说玛古斯刚旅行回来，这才把律师眼中的那点儿猜疑的神气给消灭了。她说最迟到后天，一定让他在邦斯屋里跟犹太人见面，把收藏的东西定个价钱。

“你得跟我公平交易，”弗莱齐埃回答，“我大概要替邦斯先生的继承人做代表。在那个地位上，我更可以帮你忙了。”

这几句话说得那么强硬，把西卜女人吓了一跳。这饿鬼似的律师，大概也像她一样在那儿耍手段；所以她决心要把卖画的事赶紧办了。西卜女人这个猜测一点没有错。律师和医生凑了一笔钱，给弗莱齐埃缝了套新衣服，使他能够穿得齐齐整整地去见加缪索庭长太太。两个榛子钳的命运就凭这次会面的结果来决定。要不是为了等新衣服，弗莱齐埃决不会耽搁到现在。他预备看了西卜太太之后，去试他的上衣、背心跟裤子。不料他一去就看到衣服都已缝好，便回家换上一副新的假头发，十点左右雇了一辆车上汉诺威街，希望能见到庭长太太的面。弗莱齐埃打着白领带，戴着黄手套，全新的假头发，洒着葡萄牙香水，很像水晶瓶子里的毒药：封皮，标签，缚的线，都很花哨，可是叫人看了只觉得更害怕。他的坚决的神气，满是小肉刺的脸，生的皮肤病，他的绿眼睛和凶恶的气息，好比青天上的云一样明显。在办公室内面对西卜女人的时候，他是杀人犯用的一把普通的刀；在庭长太太门外，他变为少妇们放在小古董架上的一把精致的匕首了。





五十二、容光焕发的弗莱齐埃


汉诺威街那边经过了很大的变化。包比诺子爵夫妇，前任部长夫妇，都不愿意庭长先生和庭长太太把产业给女儿做了陪嫁之后，搬到外边去另租屋子。三层的老太太下乡养老，把屋子退租了；庭长他们便搬上三楼。加缪索太太还留着玛特兰纳·维凡、一个男当差和一个厨娘，可是境况又恢复到早年一样的艰难，唯一的安慰是白住了四千法郎租金的屋子，另外还有一万法郎年俸。这种清苦对玛维尔太太已经不大合适，她是需要相当的家财和她的野心配合的。何况他们把全部产业给了女儿之后，庭长的被选举的资格也跟着丧失了。阿曼丽却照旧一心一意希望丈夫当议员，因为她决不轻易放弃计划，始终想要庭长在玛维尔庄田所在的那个州县里当选。老加缪索新进了贵族院，新封了男爵；两个月以来媳妇磨着他，要他在遗产项下先拨出十万法郎。她预备拿去买一块地，就是给玛维尔庄田在四边围住了的一块，付了捐税每年有两千法郎收入。将来她和丈夫可以住在自己的产业上，靠近着孩子们。原有的庄田不但是扩充了，地形也可以变得更完整。庭长太太在公公前面尽量地说，为了把女儿嫁给包比诺子爵，她自己一个钱都不剩了；她问老人家是否愿意耽误他大儿子的前程，使他爬不上司法界的最高地位，那是一定要拥有国会的势力才有希望的；而她丈夫的确能当选议员，教部长们怕他。她说：

“那些人哪，直要被你拉紧领带，把舌头都吐了出来，才肯给你一点东西。他们都是无情无义的家伙！也不想想沾了加缪索多少光！哼，加缪索要不促成七月法案，路易·菲利普怎么上得了台[1]！……”

老人回答说，他对铁路的投资超过了他的实力；所以媳妇的话虽然有理，也得等股票上涨的时候才能拨款子。

庭长太太几天以前听到老人只许了一半的愿，觉得闷闷不乐。照这个情形，下届议会的改选恐怕赶不及了，因为被选的条件不单是要有相当的产业，而且置产的时期要满一年。

弗莱齐埃不费什么事就见到了玛特兰纳·维凡。这两个毒蛇般性格的人一见就知道是自己人。

“小姐，”弗莱齐埃的声音很甜，“我想见见庭长夫人，有件跟她个人和她财产有关的事，你可以告诉她是为了一笔遗产……我没有机会拜见过她，所以我的姓名对她是不生作用的……我平常不大走出办公室，可是我知道对一位庭长夫人应当怎样敬重，所以我亲自来了，尤其因为那件事一刻也耽搁不得。”

以这样的措辞作引子，再经老妈子进去添枝加叶地说了一遍，接见是当然没有问题的了。这一刻工夫，对弗莱齐埃所存的两种野心正是千钧一发的关头。所以，就凭内地小律师那股百折不回的勇气，死抓不放的性格，强烈的欲望，他当时也不免像决战开始时的将军，有点胜负成败在此一举的感觉。过去最强烈的发汗药，对他生满皮肤病而毛孔闭塞的身子也不生效力，可是踏进阿曼丽在那儿等他的小客厅的一刹那，他脑门上背脊上都微微地出了点汗。他心里想：“即使发财的事不成功，至少我的命是保住了，因为波冷说过，只要我能出汗，就有恢复健康的希望。”

庭长太太穿着便服等在那里。

“太太……”弗莱齐埃叫了一声，停下来行了个礼，那种恭敬在司法界中是承认对方比自己高级的表示。

“坐下吧，先生。”庭长太太马上认出他是个吃法律饭的。

“庭长夫人，我所以敢为了一件跟庭长先生利益有关的事来求见，是因为我断定，玛维尔先生以他高级的地位，也许把事情听其自然，以致损失了七八十万法郎；可是我认为对于这一类的私事，太太们的见解比最精明的法官还要高明，或许会……”

“你提到一笔遗产……”庭长太太截住了他的话。阿曼丽听到那个数目有点飘飘然，却不愿意露出她的惊讶和高兴；她只学着一般性急的读者的样，急于想知道小说的结局。

“是的，太太，是一笔你们失之交臂的遗产，可是我能够，我有方法替你们挽回过来……”

“你说吧，先生！”玛维尔太太口气冷冷的，用她藐视而尖利的目光打量着弗莱齐埃。

“太太，我久仰您的大才，我是从芒德来的。那边的勒勃夫院长，玛维尔先生的朋友，可以把我的底细告诉庭长……”

庭长太太突然把腰板一挺，意思那么明显，使弗莱齐埃不得不赶紧说明一下。

“以太太这样心明眼亮的人，马上就会知道为什么我先跟太太谈我自己。那是提到遗产最近便的路。”

对这句巧妙的话，庭长太太只做了个手势回答。弗莱齐埃知道他可以往下说了：

“太太，我在芒德当过诉讼代理人，我的事务所就是我整个的家私，因为我是勒佛罗先生的后任，您一定认识他吧？……”

庭长太太点了点头。

“我借了一笔资本，自己又凑上万把法郎，离开了台洛希，巴黎最能干的一个诉讼代理人，我在他那儿当过六年一等书记。不幸我得罪了芒德的检察官……”

“奥里维哀·维奈。”

“对啦，太太，那位检察署长的儿子。他追着一位太太……”

“他吗？”

“是的，他追求华蒂南太太……”

“哦！华蒂南太太……她长得很漂亮，并且很……在我那个时候……”

“她对我很不错，这就种下了祸根……”弗莱齐埃接着说，“我很勤奋，我想还清朋友的债，想结婚；我需要案子，到处招揽；没有多久，我一个人的业务比所有的同业都忙了。这样，芒德的诉讼代理人，公证人，甚至执达吏，都跟我过不去啦。他们预备跟我找麻烦。您知道，在我们这可怕的行业里，要跟人捣乱是挺容易的。有件案子我接受了两造的委托，给人发觉了。当然事情是做得轻率了些；但在某些情形之下，在巴黎是行得通的，诉讼代理人往往彼此交换条件。在芒德可不行。我对蒲伊翁南先生帮过这一类的小忙，他却受了同业的压迫，听了检察官的怂恿，把我出卖了……您瞧我什么都不瞒您。那可犯了众怒。我变了个坏蛋，人家把我说得比玛拉还要可怕。我不得不卖掉事务所，把一切都丢了。我到巴黎来想搅个小小的代办所，可是我的健康给毁了，二十四小时就没有两小时舒服的。如今我只有一个欲望，很可怜的欲望。您有朝一日可能变成司法部长的太太，或是首席庭长太太；我这个骨瘦如柴的穷人，却只巴望找个小差事混到老，默默无闻地抱住饭碗。我想当个初级法庭庭长。在您或在庭长先生，替我谋这种小差事真是太容易了，连现任的司法部长都忌惮你们，巴不得讨你们喜欢呢……”

他看到庭长太太做了个手势预备开口了，便赶紧说：“不，太太，我的话还没有完。我有个做医生的朋友，正在看一个老年的病人，便是庭长先生应当承继的人。您瞧，我们可提到正文来了……我们少不了这位医生的合作，而他的情形就跟我现在一样：有了本领没有机会！……我从他那儿才知道你们的利益受了损害，因为就是眼前，我们在这儿说话的时候，可能什么都完了，可能就立了一张剥夺庭长承继权的遗嘱……那医生希望当一个医院的主任，或是王家中学的医师，反正是想谋一个巴黎的差事，和我的差不多的……请您原谅我大胆提出这两个问题，可是我们对这件事一点不能含糊。并且那医生是个很受敬重很有学问的人，令婿包比诺子爵的舅太公比勒洛先生的病是他给治好的。倘使您宽宏大量，肯答应我初级法庭庭长和主任医生这两个位置，我可以负责把遗产差不多原封不动地给您送上来，我说差不多原封不动，因为其中要除去一小部分给遗产受赠人，给其他几个我们必须要他们帮忙的人。你的诺言，可以等我的诺言兑现之后再履行。”

五十三、买卖的条件


庭长太太抱着手臂听着，好像一个人不得不听一番说教似的；这时她放下手臂，瞅着弗莱齐埃，说道：“先生，关于你自己的事，你说得一明一白了；可是我觉得你对正文还是一篇糊涂账……”

“太太，再加一两句，事情就揭穿了。庭长先生是邦斯先生独一无二的三等亲属继承人。邦斯先生病得很重，要立遗嘱了，也许已经立了。他把遗产送给一个叫作许模克的德国朋友。遗产值到七十万以上，三天之内，我可以知道准确的数目……”

庭长太太听了这个数字大吃一惊，不由得自言自语地说：“要是真的话，我跟他翻脸简直是大错特错了，我不该责备他……”

“不，太太，要没有那一场，他会像小鸟一样的开心，比您，比庭长，比我，都活得久呢……上帝自有他的主意，咱们不必多推敲！”他因为说得太露骨了，特意来这么两句遮盖一下，“那是没有办法的！咱们吃法律饭的，看事情只看实际。太太，现在您可明白了，以庭长这样高的地位，他对这件事决不会也决不能有所行动。他跟舅舅变了死冤家，你们不见他的面了，把他从社会上撵出去了；你们这样做想必有充分的理由；可是事实是那家伙病了，把财产送给了他唯一的朋友。在这种情形之下立的一张合乎法定方式的遗嘱，一个巴黎高等法院的庭长能有什么话说呢？可是，太太，我们在私底下看，这究竟是极不愉快的事，明明有权承继七八十万的遗产……谁知道，也许上一百万呢，我们以法定的唯一的继承人资格，竟没有能把这笔遗产抓回来！……要抓回来，就得把自己牵入卑鄙龌龊的阴谋，又疙瘩，又无聊，要跟那些下等人打交道，跟仆役、下属发生关系，紧紧地盯着他们：这样的事，巴黎没有一个诉讼代理人，没有一个公证人办得了。那需要一个没有案子的律师，像我这样的，一方面要真有能力，要赤胆忠心；一方面又潦倒不堪，跟那些人的地位不相上下……我在我一区里替中下阶级、工人、平民办事……唉，太太，我落到这个田地，就因为如今在巴黎署理的那位检察官对我起了恶感，不能原谅我本领高人一等……太太，我久仰您大名，知道有了您做靠山是多么稳固的，我觉得替您效劳，干了这件事，就有苦尽甘来的希望，而我的朋友波冷医生也能够扬眉吐气了……”

庭长太太有了心事。那一忽儿工夫，弗莱齐埃可真急坏了。芒德的检察官，一年以前被调到巴黎来署理；他的父亲维奈是中间党派的一个领袖，当了十六年检察署长，早已有资格当司法部长，他是阴险的庭长太太的对头……傲慢的检察署长公然表示瞧不起加缪索庭长。这些情形是弗莱齐埃不知道，也不应该知道的。

“除了在一件案子中接受两造的委托以外，你良心上没有别的疙瘩吗？”她把眼睛瞪着弗莱齐埃问。

“太太可以问勒勃夫先生，他对我是不错的。”

“你可有把握，勒勃夫先生替你在庭长跟包比诺伯爵面前说好话吗？”

“那我可以保证，尤其维奈先生已经离开芒德；因为，我可以私下说一句，勒勃夫先生很怕那个干巴巴的检察官。并且，庭长太太，要是您允许，我可以到芒德去见一见勒勃夫先生。那也不会耽误事情，因为遗产的准确数目要过两三天才能知道。为这桩事所用的手段，我不愿也不能告诉太太，可是我对自己的尽心尽力所期望的报酬，不就等于保证您成功吗？”

“行，那么你去想法请勒勃夫先生替你说句好话；要是遗产真像你说的那么可观，我还不大相信呢，那我答应你要求的两个位置，当然是以事情成功为条件啰……”

“我可以担保，太太。可是将来我需要的时候，请把您的公证人、诉讼代理人都邀来，以庭长的名义给我一份委托书，同时请您要那几位听我调度，不能自作主张地行动。”

“你负了责任，我当然给你全权，”庭长太太的口气很郑重，“可是邦斯先生真的病得很重吗？”她又带着点笑容问。

“我相信，太太，他是医得好的，尤其他找的是个很认真的医生；我的朋友波冷并没起什么坏心，他是听了我的指挥，为您的利益去刺探情形的；他有能力把老音乐家救过来；可是病人身边有个看门女人，为了三万法郎会送他进坟墓。不是谋杀他，不是给他吃砒霜，她才不那么慈悲呢，她更辣手，用的是软功，成天不断地去刺激他。可怜的老头儿，换一个安静的环境，譬如在乡下吧，能有周到的服侍，朋友的安慰，一定会恢复；可是给一个泼辣的女人折磨——她年轻时候，是闻名巴黎的二三十个牡蛎美人之中的一个，又贪心，又多嘴，又蛮横——病人给她磨着，要他在遗嘱上送她大大的一笔钱，最后肝脏会硬化的，也许现在已经生了结石，非开刀不可了，而那个手术病人是受不住的……医生哪，是个绝顶好人！……他可为难死了。照理他应当教病人把那婆娘打发掉……”

“那泼妇简直是野兽了！”庭长夫人装出温柔的声音叫。

弗莱齐埃听到这种跟自己相像的声音，不由得在肚里暗笑，他知道把天生刺耳的嗓音故意装作柔和是什么意思。他想起路易十一所说的故事。有位法官娶了一位太太，跟苏格拉底的太太一模一样[1]，法官却并没那个大人物的达观，便在燕麦中加了盐喂他的马匹，又不给它们喝水。有一天，太太坐了车沿着塞纳河到乡下去，那些马急于喝水，便连车带人一起拉到了河里。于是法官感谢上帝替他这样自自然然地摆脱了太太。这时，玛维尔太太也在感谢上帝在邦斯身边安插了一个女人，替她把邦斯不着痕迹地摆脱掉。

她说：“只要有一点儿不清白，哪怕一百万我也不拿的……你的朋友应当点醒邦斯先生，把看门女人打发走。”

“太太，第一，许模克和邦斯两位把这女人当作天使，不但不肯听我朋友的话，还会把他打发走呢。第二，这该死的牡蛎美人还是医生的恩人，他给比勒洛先生看病就是她介绍去的。他嘱咐她对病人要一百二十分地柔和，可是这个话反而给她指点了加重病势的方法。”

“你的朋友对我舅舅的病认为怎么样呢？”

弗莱齐埃的答话那么中肯，眼光那么尖锐，把那颗跟西卜女人一样贪婪的心看得那么清楚，使庭长太太为之一震。

“六个星期之内，继承可以开始了[2]。”

庭长太太把眼睛低了下去。

“可怜的人！”她想装出哀伤的神气，可是装不像。

“太太有什么话要我转达勒勃夫先生吗？我预备坐火车到芒德去。”

“好吧，你坐一会，我去写封信约他明天来吃饭；我们要他来商量，把你那件冤枉事给平反一下。”

庭长太太一走开，弗莱齐埃仿佛已经当上初级法庭庭长，人也不是本来面目了：他胖了起来，好不舒畅地呼吸着快乐的空气，吹到了万事如意的好风。意志那个神秘的宝库，给他添了一般强劲的新生的力量，他像雷蒙诺克一样，觉得为了成功竟有胆子去犯罪，只要不留痕迹。他一鼓作气来到庭长太太面前，把猜测肯定为事实，天花乱坠地说得凿凿有据，但求她委托自己去抢救那笔遗产而得到她的提拔。他和医生两人，过的是无边苦海的生活，心中存的亦是无穷无极的欲望。他预备把珍珠街上那个丑恶的住所一脚踢开。盘算之下，西卜女人的酬金大概可有三千法郎，庭长那里五千法郎，这就足够去租一个像样的公寓。并且他欠波冷的情分也能还掉了。有些阴险的性格，虽然被苦难磨得非常凶狠，也会感到相反方面的情绪，跟恶念一样强烈：黎塞留是个残酷的敌人，也是个热心的朋友。为了报答波冷的恩惠，弗莱齐埃便是砍下自己的脑袋都愿意。庭长太太拿着一封信进来，对这个自以为幸福而有了存款的人，偷偷地瞧了一下，觉得不像她第一眼看到的那么丑了；并且他现在要做她的爪牙了，而我们看自己的工具和看邻人的工具，眼光总是不同的。

“弗莱齐埃先生，”她说，“我已经看出你是个聪明人，我也相信你是坦白的。”

弗莱齐埃做了个意味深长的姿势。

“那么，”她接着又说，“请你老老实实回答一个问题：你的行动会不会连累我，或是连累玛维尔先生？……”

“我绝不敢来见您的，太太，要是将来有一天，我会埋怨自己把泥巴丢在了你们身上，哪怕像针尖般小的污点，在你们身上也要像月亮般大。太太，您忘了我要做一个巴黎初级法庭的庭长，先得使你们满意。我一生受的第一个教训，已经使我吃不消了，还敢再碰那样的钉子吗？末了，还有一句话，我一切的行动，凡是关涉到你们的，一定先来请示……”

“那很好。这儿是给勒勃夫先生的信。现在我就等你报告遗产价值的消息。”

“关键就在这里。”弗莱齐埃很狡猾地说，他对庭长太太行着礼，尽他的脸所能表示的做得眉开眼笑。

“谢天谢地！”加缪索太太心里想，“哦！我可以有钱啦！加缪索可以当选议员啦。派这个弗莱齐埃到鲍贝克县里去活动，他准会替我们张罗到多数的选票。这工具再好没有了！”

“谢天谢地！”弗莱齐埃走下楼梯的时候想，“加缪索太太真是一个角色！我要有这一类的女人做太太才好呢！行了，干事要紧！”

于是他动身上芒德向一个不大认识的人讨情去了。他把这希望寄托在华蒂南太太身上。过去他的倒塌就是为了她；可是不幸的爱情，往往像可靠的债务人的一张到期不付的借票，会加你利钱的。

五十四、给老鳏夫的警告


三天以后，许模克正在睡觉，因为老音乐家和西卜太太已经把看护病人的重任分担了，她跟可怜的邦斯，像她所说的抢白了一场。肝脏炎有个可怕的症候，我们不妨在此说一说。凡是肝脏受了损害的病人，都容易急躁、发怒，而发怒会教人暂时松动一下，正如一个人发烧的时候精力会特别充沛。可是高潮一过，他马上衰弱到极点，像医生所谓的虚脱了，而身体所受的内伤也格外严重。所以害肝病的人，尤其因精神受了打击而得肝病的人，大发雷霆以后的虚弱特别危险，因为他的饮食已经受到严格的限制。这是扰乱人的液体机能的热度[1]，对血和头脑部不相干的。全身的刺激引起一种抑郁感，使病人对自己都要生气。在这等情形中，无论什么事都可以促成剧烈的冲动，甚至有性命之忧。下等阶级出身的西卜女人，既没有经验，也没有教育，尽管医生告诫，也决不肯相信液体组织会把神经组织弄得七颠八倒。波冷的解释，在她心目中只是做医生的一厢情愿。她像所有平民阶级的人一样，无论如何要拿东西给邦斯吃，直要波冷斩钉截铁地告诉她：“你给邦斯吃一口随便什么东西，就等于把他一枪打死。”才能拦住她不偷偷地给他一片火腿、一盘炒鸡子，或是一杯香草巧克力。在这一点上，一般平民真是固执到极点。他们生了病不愿意进医院，就因为相信医院里不给病人吃东西，把他们活活饿死。病人的妻子夹带食物所造成的死亡率，甚至使医生不得不下令，在探望病人的日子，家属的身体必须经过严格搜查。西卜女人为了要立刻捞一笔钱，想跟邦斯暂时翻脸，便把怎样上戏院去看经理，怎样和舞女哀络依思斗嘴，统统告诉了邦斯。

“可是你到那儿去干吗呀？”病人已经问到第三遍。只要西卜女人一打开话匣子，他就拦不住的了。

“那时候，赶到我训了她一顿，哀络依思小姐知道了我是谁，她就扯了白旗，咱们也变作世界上最好的朋友。——现在你问我上那儿去干什么是不是？”她把邦斯的问话重复了一遍。

有些多嘴的人，可以称为多嘴的天才的，就会这样地把对方插进来的话，或是反对的意见，或是补充的言论，拉过来当作材料，仿佛怕他们自己的来源会枯竭似的。

“哎，我是去替你的高狄沙先生解决困难呀；他有出芭蕾舞剧要人写音乐；亲爱的，你又没法拿些纸来乱画一阵，交你的差……我就无意中听到，他们找了一个迦朗育先生，去给《莫希耿》写音乐……”

“迦朗育！”邦斯气得直嚷，“迦朗育一点儿才气都没有，他要当第一提琴手我还不要呢！他很聪明，写些关于音乐的文章倒很好；可是我就不相信他能写一个调子！……你哪儿来的鬼念头，会想起上戏院去的？”

“哎唷，瞧你这个死心眼儿，你这个魔鬼！……得了吧，小乖乖，咱们别说来就来生那么大的气好不好？……像你现在这样，你能写音乐吗？难道你没有照过镜子？要不要我给你一面镜子？你只剩皮包骨头了……力气就跟麻雀差不多……你还以为能够写音符？……连我的账你都写不起来呢……哦，对啦，我得上四楼去一趟，他们该我十七个法郎……十七法郎也是个数目呀；付了药剂师的账，咱们只剩二十法郎了……所以哪，我得告诉那个人，看上去倒是个好人，那个高狄沙……我喜欢这个名字……他是嘻嘻哈哈的快活人，很配我的胃口……他呀，他可不会闹肝病的！……我把你的情形告诉了他……不是吗，你身体不行，他暂时叫人代替你的位置……”

“代替了！”邦斯大叫一声，在床上坐了起来。

一般而论，生病的人，尤其被死神的魔掌拿住了的，拼命想抓住差事的劲儿，简直跟初出道的人谋事一样。所以听说位置有人代替，快死的人就觉得已经死了一半。他接着说：

“可是医生说我情形很好呢！他认为我不久生活就能照常了。你害了我，毁了我，要了我的命！……”

“啧！啧！啧！啧！”西卜女人叫起来，“你又来啦！好吧，我是你的刽子手，你在我背后老对许模克先生说这些好听的话，哼！我都听见的……你真是个没心没肺的恶人。”

“你可不知道，只要我的病多拖上半个月，我好起来的时候，人家就会说我老朽，老顽固，落伍了，说我是帝政时代的，十八世纪的古董！”病人这样嚷着，一心只想活下去，“那时，迦朗育在戏院里从顶楼到卖票房都交了朋友啦！他会降低一个调门，去迁就一个没有嗓子的女戏子，他会趴在地上舔高狄沙的靴子；他会拉拢他的三朋四友，在报纸上乱捧一阵；可是，你知道，西卜太太，平常报纸专门在光头上找头发的呢！……你见了什么鬼会跑得去的？……”

“怪啦！许模克先生为这件事跟我商量了八天呢。你要怎么办？你眼里只看见你自己，你自私自利，恨不得叫别人送了命来治好你的病！……可怜许模克先生，一个月到现在拖得筋疲力尽，走投无路。他哪儿都去不成了，又不能去上课，又不能到戏院里去上班，因为，难道你不看见吗？他通宵陪着你，我白天陪着你。早先我以为你穷，所以由我陪夜，现在再要那么办，我白天就得睡觉，那么家里的事谁管？你的宝贝又归谁看着呢？……有什么法儿，病总是病呀！……不是吗？……”

“许模克决不会打这个主意的……”

“那么是我凭空想出来的？你以为我们的身体是铁打的？要是许模克先生照旧一天教七八个学生，晚上六点半到十一点半在戏院里指挥乐队，不消十天他就没有命了……这好人，为了你便是挤出血来都愿意，你可要他死吗？我可以叫爷叫娘地起誓，像你这种病人真是从来没见过……你的理性到哪儿去啦？难道送进了当铺吗？这儿大家都在为你卖命，每件事都尽了力，你还不满意……你要逼我们气得发疯不是？……我吗，不说别的，我人快倒下来了！……”

西卜女人尽可以信口胡说，邦斯气得话都说不上来了，他在床上扭来扭去，结结巴巴地只能迸出几个声音，他要死过去了。到了这个阶段，照理急转直下，吵架一变而为亲热的表示。看护女人扑到病人身边，捧着他的脑袋，硬逼他睡下去，把被单盖在他身上。

“你怎么能这样呢！我的乖乖，怪来怪去只能怪你的病！波冷先生就是这么说的。得了吧，你静静吧。好孩子，乖一点呀。凡是接近你的人都把你当作宝贝似的，医生甚至一天来瞧你两回！倘使看到你烦躁成这样，他要怎么说呢？你教我沉不住气，唉，你真是不应该……一个人有西卜太太看护的时候，应当敬重她呀！……你却又叫又嚷！……你明明知道那是不可以的。说话会刺激你的……干吗要生气呀？这都是你的错，老跟我闹别扭！喂，咱们讲个理吧！倘使许模克先生和我，我是把你当作心肝宝贝一般的，倘使我们认为做得不错……那么，告诉你，就是做得不错！”

“许模克不会不跟我商量，就叫你上戏院去的……”

“要不要叫醒他，要他来做见证呢？可怜的好人睡得像登了天似的。”

“不！不！倘使我的好朋友许模克决定这样办，那么也许我的病比我自己想象的要重得多，”邦斯说着，对他卧房里陈设的美术品好不凄惨地瞧了一眼，“得跟我心爱的画，跟我当作朋友一般的这些东西……跟我那个超凡入圣的许模克告别了！——哦！可是真的吗？”

西卜女人这恶毒的戏子把手帕掩着眼睛。这个没有声音的答复顿时使病人黯然若失。地位与健康，失业与死亡，在这个最受不起打击的两点上受了打击，他完全消沉了，连发怒的气力也没有了。他奄奄一息地愣在那里，好似害肺病的人和临终苦难挣扎过了的情景。

西卜女人看见她的俘虏完全屈服了，便道：“我说，为了许模克先生的利益，你最好把德洛浓先生找来，他是本区的公证人，人挺好的。”

“你老是跟我提到这个德洛浓……”

“嘿！随你将来给我多少，请这个请那个，我才不在乎呢！”

她侧了侧脑袋表示瞧不起金钱。于是两人都不作声了。

五十五、西卜女人叫屈


那时许模克已经睡了六个多钟点，给肚子饿闹醒了。他走进邦斯屋子，一言不发地对他看了一会，因为西卜女人把手指放在嘴唇上警告他：“嘘！”

然后她站起来走近德国人，附在他耳边说：“谢天谢地！这一下他快睡着了，刚才他凶得像要吃人似的！……也难怪，他是跟他的病挣扎……”

“哪里！我倒是很有耐性呢，”病人凄恻的声音表示他已经萎靡到极点，“可是，亲爱的许模克，她到戏院去教人把我开差了。”

他歇了一下，没有力气说下去。西卜女人趁此机会对许模克做了个手势，意思是说他神志不清。她说：“你别跟他分辩，他快死过去了……”

“她还说是你叫她去的……”邦斯瞧着老实的许模克补上一句。

“是的，”许模克拿出代人受过的勇气，“那没有法儿呀。你别多讲！……让我们把你救过来！……有了这些家私还要拼命做事，你傻不傻？……只要你快快好起来，咱们卖掉些小古董，安安静静地躲在一边过日子，带着这个好西卜太太……”

“她把你教坏了！”邦斯很痛苦地回答。

西卜女人特意站在床后，好偷偷地对许模克做手势。病人看不见她，以为她走了，接着又说：“她要我的命！”

“怎么！我要你的命？……”她突然闪出身子，红着眼睛，把拳头叉在腰里，“做牛做马，落得这个报答吗？……哎唷，我的天！”

她眼泪马上涌了出来，就手儿倒在一张沙发里；这悲剧式的动作对邦斯又是个加重病势的刺激。

“好吧，”她又站起身子瞪着两个朋友，眼睛里射出两颗子弹和一肚子的怨毒，“我在这儿不顾死活地干，还不见一点好，我受够了。你们去找一个看护女人吧！”

两个朋友听了，相顾失色。

“哦！你们俩尽管挤眉弄眼地做戏吧！我主意拿定了！我去请波冷医生找个看护女人来。咱们把账算一算。你们得还我在这儿垫的钱……我本意是永远不跟你们要的……哼，我还为你们又向比勒洛先生借了五百法郎呢……”

“那是他的病呀！”许模克扑过去抱着她的腰，“你耐着点性子吧！”

“你，你是一个天使，我会跪在地上亲你的脚印。可是邦斯先生从来没有喜欢过我，老是恨我的……并且还以为我要在他遗嘱上有个名字呢！……”

“嘘——！你要他的命了！”许模克叫着。

“再会，先生，”她走过来对邦斯像霹雳似的瞪了一眼，“你说我对你那么坏，我还是希望你好。赶到你对我和和气气，觉得我做的事并没有错的时候我再来！暂时我待在家里……你是我的孩子，哪有孩子反抗妈妈的？——不，许模克先生，你再说也没用……你的饭我给你送来，我照常服侍你；可是你们得找个看护女人，托波冷医生找吧。”

说完她走了，气势汹汹地关上房门，把一些贵重而细巧的东西震得摇摇欲坠。瓷器的叮当声，在受难的病人听来，仿佛一个熬着车刑的人，听到了最后那个送他上天的声音。

一小时以后，西卜女人不走进邦斯的卧室，只隔着房门招呼许模克，说他的晚饭已经在饭厅里了。可怜的德国人脸色惨白，挂满了眼泪走出来。

“可怜的邦斯神志糊涂了，他竟把你当作一个坏人。那都是他的病哟。”许模克这么说着，想讨好西卜女人而同时不责备邦斯。

“哦！他的病，我真是受够了！告诉你，他又不是我的父亲，又不是我的丈夫，又不是我的弟兄，又不是我的孩子。他讨厌我，那么好，大家拉倒！你哪，你到天边，我也跟你到天边；可是一个人卖了命，拿出了真心，拿出了全部的积蓄，甚至连丈夫都来不及照顾，你知道，西卜病了，结果我还给人家当作坏人……那真是他妈的太那个了……”

“他妈的？”

“是的，他妈的！废话少说。咱们谈正经。你们该我三个月的钱，每月一百九十法郎，一共是五百七！我代付了两次房租，连捐税和小费，六百法郎，收条在这里；两项加起来，一千二不到，另外我借给你们两千，当然不算利息；总数是三千一百九十二法郎……除了这个，你至少还得预备两千法郎对付看护女人、医生、药，和看护女人的伙食。所以我又向比勒洛先生借了一千法郎在这里。”她把高狄沙给的一千法郎拿给许模克看。

许模克对她这笔账听得呆住了，因为他的不懂银钱出入，就好比猫的不懂音乐。

“西卜太太，邦斯是头脑不清楚！请你原谅他，照旧来服侍他，做我们的好天使吧……我给你磕个头求情吧。”德国人说着跪在了地上，捧着这刽子手的手亲吻。

“听我说，小乖乖，”她把他扶了起来，亲了亲他的额角，“西卜病了，躺在床上，我才叫人去请了波冷医生。在这个情形之下，我的事一定要料理清楚。并且，西卜看我哭哭啼啼地回去，气恼得不得了，不准我再上这儿来了。他要收回他的钱，那也难怪，钱原来是他的。我们做女人的能有什么法儿？还了他三千二百法郎，说不定他的气会消下去。可怜的人！那是他全部的家私，二十六年的积蓄，流着汗挣来的。他明天一定要这笔钱，不能再拖了……唉，你不知道西卜的脾气；他一冒火，会杀人的呢。也许我能跟他商量，照旧来服侍你们。你放心，他爱怎么说就怎么说吧，我预备受他的气，因为我太喜欢你了，你是一个天使。”

“不，我不过是个可怜虫，只知道爱我的朋友，恨不得牺牲了性命去救他……”

“可是钱哪……许模克先生，哪怕一个子儿不给我，你也得张罗三千法郎，对付你们的用途！你知道我要是你，我怎么办？我决不三心二意，立刻把没用的画儿卖掉七八张；再拿你屋子里因为没处放而靠壁堆着的，搬些出来补在客厅里。只要那儿数目不缺，管他这一张那一张！”

“干吗要补上去呢？”

“哎，他坏得很哪！不错，那是他的病，平常他是像绵羊一般的！他可能起来，东找西寻；虽说他软弱得连房门都出不来，万一他闯进客厅，画的数目总是不错啦！……”

“对！”

“将来等他完全好了，咱们再把卖画的事告诉他。那时你都推在我头上得啦，说要还我的钱，没有法儿。我才不怕负责呢。”

“不是我的东西，我总不能支配的……”老实的德国人很简单地回答。

“那么我去告一状，让法院把你和邦斯先生都传得去。”

“那不是要他命吗？……”

“这两条路你自己挑吧！……我的天！我看你还是先把画卖了，以后再告诉他……那时你拿法院的传票给他看。”

“好，你去告我们吧……那我总算有个理由……将来可以把判决书给他做交代……”

当天晚上七点钟，西卜太太跟一个执达吏商量过了，把许模克叫了去。德国人见了泰勃罗，当场听说要他付款；他浑身哆嗦地答了话，执达吏吩咐他和邦斯都得上法院去听候裁判。那个衙门里的小官儿和备案的公事，把许模克骇坏了，再也不敢抵抗。

“卖画就卖画吧。”他含着一包眼泪说。

下一天早上六点，玛古斯和雷蒙诺克一齐来把各人的画卸了下来。二千五百法郎的两张正式收据是这样写的：

“本人兹代表邦斯先生，将油画四幅出售与埃里·玛古斯先生，共得价二千五百法郎整，拨充邦斯先生个人用途。计开：女像一幅，疑系丢勒所作；又人像一幅，属于意大利画派；又荷兰风景画一幅，布勒开尔作；又《圣家庭》一幅，属于佛罗伦萨画派，作者不详。”

给雷蒙诺克的收据，措辞相仿；他的四张画是格勒兹、格劳特·劳朗、鲁本斯和凡·艾克的作品，收据上都用法国画派佛兰德画派含混过去了。

“这笔钱，使我相信了这些小玩意儿的确有点价值……”许模克拿到了五千法郎说。

“对啦，有点价值……”雷蒙诺克回答，“我很愿意出十万法郎统统买下来呢。”

邦斯有些次等的画堆在许模克屋里；奥弗涅人受了西卜女人之托，就在那一批中挑出几幅尺寸相同的放在老框子内，补足了八张空额。





五十六、弱肉强食


埃里·玛古斯拿到了四张杰作，以算账为名，把西卜女人邀到自己家里。他拼命哭穷，吹毛求疵地指出画上的缺点，说要重新修过，只能出三万法郎佣金。他把法兰西银行印着一千法郎的辉煌耀眼的钞票摆在西卜女人面前，她看得动了心，接受了。玛古斯勒令雷蒙诺克也给西卜女人同样的数目，因为雷蒙诺克是要拿四幅画做抵押，向他借这笔钱的。玛古斯觉得那四幅太美了，舍不得再放手，便在下一天送了六千法郎给旧货商作为他的赚头，教他开一张发票把画卖给了他。西卜太太有了六万八千法郎财产，又把严守秘密的话对两个同党说了一遍。她请教犹太人，怎么样才能存放这笔款子而不让人家发现。

“你不妨买奥莱昂铁路股票，目前市价比票面低三十法郎，三年之后包你对本对利；凭据只有几张纸，往皮包里一放就完了。”

“你在这儿等着，玛古斯先生，我得看邦斯先生亲属的代理人去，他要知道你对楼上那些东西肯出多少钱买……我去把他找来。”

“要是她做了寡妇，”雷蒙诺克对玛古斯说，“那倒对我正合适，你瞧她现在有钱啦……”

“倘使买了奥莱昂股票，两年工夫她的钱还能加一倍。我的一些小积蓄就投资在这上面，做我女儿陪嫁的……趁律师没有来，咱们到大街上去溜溜吧。”

“西卜已经病得很重，”雷蒙诺克又道，“要是上帝愿意把他召回，我就能有个出色的女人管铺子，我的买卖也做得开了……”

西卜女人走进法律顾问的办公室，娇声娇气地说：“你好，亲爱的弗莱齐埃先生，怎么你的门房说你要搬家了？”

“对啊，西卜太太；我在波冷医生屋子的二层楼上租了个公寓，就在他的上面。房东把屋子装修过了，怪漂亮的，我正想借两三千法郎，体体面面地布置一下。现在我负责照顾你跟玛维尔庭长两方面的利益了，就像我以前跟你说的一样……我不再干这个法律经纪人的行业，我要加入律师公会，非住得像个样儿不可。一定要有一套过得去的家具，一套藏书，巴黎的律师公会才让你登记。我是法学博士，见习过几年，如今又有了大佬做后台……啊，你说，咱们的事怎么啦？”

“我有笔积蓄存在银行里，”西卜女人对他说，“没有多少，不过三千法郎，二十五年苦吃苦熬省下来的，倘使你愿意接受，你就给我一张约期票，像雷蒙诺克说的，因为我自己什么都不懂，只知道人家叫我怎办就怎办……”

“不，公会条例不准咱们律师出约期票的。这样吧，我给你一张收据，写明五厘起息；将来我要替你在邦斯的遗产上弄到一千两百终身年金的话，你就把收据还我。”

西卜女人发觉自己上了当，不作一声。

弗莱齐埃便盯着说：“不开口就是默认。明儿你给我送来。”

“哦！我很乐意先付酬金，这样我的年金更靠得住了。”

弗莱齐埃点了点头，又说：“咱们的事怎么啦？昨天晚上我碰到波冷，似乎你对病人毫不留情哪。再像昨天那样来一次，他胆囊里准会生结石了……我看你还是缓和一点吧，好西卜太太，别教良心过不去。一个人不是长命百岁的。”

“得了吧，什么良心不良心的！……你还想拿断头台来吓我吗？邦斯先生简直是个老顽固！你可不知道他呢！是他惹我冒火的！世界上再没比他更恶的人了，活该受他亲戚的那一套……他又刁，又毒，又是死心眼儿！……我把答应你的话做到了，现在玛古斯先生在我们那儿等你。”

“好！……我跟你同时赶到就是了。你年金的多少全靠那个收藏的价值；要是有八十万，你一年就能有一千五……那是个很大的数目呢！”

“那么，我去吩咐他们估价的时候要绝对公平。”

一小时以后，邦斯正睡得很熟。他从许模克手里吃了一点医生开的安神药，可是被西卜女人私下把量加了一倍。弗莱齐埃、雷蒙诺克、玛古斯这三个十恶不赦的家伙，把老音乐家收藏的一千七百件东西，一样一样地仔细看过来。许模克也睡在那里，所以那些乌鸦尽可以嗅着死尸，为所欲为了。

玛古斯屡次对着作品出神，看到什么杰作便指点雷蒙诺克，告诉他作品的价值，和他讨论；那时西卜女人就得警告他们：“别出声呀！”

四个人各有各的贪心，都希望物主早死，如今趁他睡着的时候先来掂一掂遗产的斤两：这样的一幕叫人看了真是揪心。他们直花了三小时才把客厅里的东西看完。

“平均计算，”吝啬的老犹太人说，“这儿每件东西值一千法郎。”

“那么总共有一百七十万了！”弗莱齐埃听着愣住了。

“对我是不值的，”玛古斯眼里发出一道冷光，“我不会出到八十万以上；因为你不知道那些东西要在铺子里搁多久……有些精品要过十年才卖得出，那时进价以复利计算已经加了一倍；可是我要买的话是付现款的。”

“卧室里还有彩色玻璃、珐琅、小型画、金银的鼻烟壶等等。”雷蒙诺克在旁提了一句。

“能去瞧瞧吗？”弗莱齐埃问。

“让我去看看他是不是睡得很熟。”西卜女人回答。门房女人做了个手势，三只掠食的鸟便走了进去。

“那边是精品，”玛古斯指着客厅说，他的白须根根都在那里攒动，“这儿是贵重的宝物！而且是何等的宝物！帝王的宫中也没有比这儿更美的东西。”

雷蒙诺克瞧着那些鼻烟壶，眼睛亮得像两颗宝石。弗莱齐埃，沉着，冷静，像一条蛇在地上竖了起来，扯着他的扁脑袋，姿势活像画家笔下的曼非斯托番。这三个不同的吝啬鬼，对黄金的饥渴像魔鬼贪嗜天堂上的露水一样，不约而同对宝物的主人瞧了一眼，因为他在床上动了一动，仿佛一个人做噩梦时的动作。给三道魔鬼般的目光注视之下，病人突然睁开眼睛，大叫起来：

“有贼！有贼！……警察呀！有人谋杀我呀！”

显而易见，他虽然醒了，还是在做梦，因为他在床上坐起，眼睛越睁越大，白白地定在那里，一动也不能动。

玛古斯和雷蒙诺克抢着往门外跑，可是被一句话喝住了：

“玛古斯！……我给人出卖了！……”

病人是被保护爱物的本能惊醒的，这情绪至少和保卫生命的本能一样强。

“西卜太太，这一位是谁？”他一看到弗莱齐埃，不由得打了个寒噤。弗莱齐埃却呆呆地站在那儿。

“哎啊！你想我能把他赶出去吗？”她眨巴着眼睛说，同时对弗莱齐埃递了个暗号，“这先生才来，代表你的亲属来看你……”

弗莱齐埃竟没法不露出佩服西卜女人的表情。

“是的，先生，我代表玛维尔庭长太太，代表她的丈夫，她的女儿，来向你道歉。他们无意中知道你病了，很想亲自来招呼你……接你到玛维尔田庄上去养病；包比诺子爵夫人，你那么喜欢的赛西尔，预备做你的看护……她在她母亲面前替你分辩，现在庭长太太也觉得她自己错了……”

“哼！我的继承人派你来，”邦斯气得直嚷，“还给你找了一个巴黎最有眼光的鉴赏家，最精明的专家！……啊！你的故事倒编得不错！”他说到这里像疯子一般哈哈大笑，“你们来估我的画，估我的古董，估我的鼻烟壶！估我的小型画！……好，你们估价吧！你找的人不但每样都内行，而且还有钱买，他是上千万的富翁哪……我的遗产，我那些亲爱的家属用不着等久的了，”他含讥带讽地说，“他们把我勒死了！……嘿，西卜太太，你自称为我的母亲，可趁我睡觉的时候，把一些做买卖的，跟我竞争的，和玛维尔家的人，带到这儿来！……你们都给我滚出去！……”

可怜虫又是愤怒又是害怕，冲动之下，竟撑起瘦骨嶙峋的身子站了起来。

“抓住我的胳膊，先生，”西卜女人扑上去扶着他，不让他倒下来，“你静静吧，那些人都走了。”

“我要瞧瞧我的客厅去！……”快死的病人说。

西卜女人做个手势叫三只乌鸦赶快飞走；然后她抓着邦斯，也不理会他的叫喊，像捡一根羽毛似的把他抱起来放倒在床上。看见可怜的收藏家完全瘫倒了，她便出去关上大门。邦斯的三个刽子手还在楼梯台上，西卜女人招呼他们等一会；同时她听见弗莱齐埃正在对玛古斯说：

“你们俩得共同署名写一封信，说愿意出九十万现款承买邦斯先生的收藏；将来我们一定让你们大大地赚一笔。”

然后他咬着西卜女人的耳朵说了一个字，只有一个字，而且是谁也听不见的；说完他和两个商人下楼到门房里去了。





五十七、许模克至诚格天


看门女人回进屋子，可怜的邦斯问：“西卜太太，他们走了吗？”

“谁？……谁走了？……”她反问他。

“那些人呀……”

“那些人？……怎么，你看到了人？……刚才你热度多高，要不是我在这儿，你早已从窗里跳出去了，现在你又跟我说什么人……你头脑老是不清楚吗？……”

“怎么？刚才这儿不是有位先生，说是我亲属派来的吗？……”

“你还要跟我胡闹？……哼，你该教人送到哪儿去，你知道吗？送到夏朗东[1]！……你见神见鬼地看到人！……”

“怎么没有人，埃里·玛古斯！雷蒙诺克！……”

“啊！雷蒙诺克，你看到雷蒙诺克是可能的；他来告诉我可怜的西卜情形很不好，我只能丢下你不管了。你知道，第一得救我的西卜。只要我男人一闹病，我就谁都不理了。你静下来睡两个钟点吧，我已经打发人去请波冷医生，等会我跟他一起来……你喝点水，乖乖地睡吧。”

“真的没人到我屋子里来过吗，我刚才醒来的时候？……”

“没有！你也许在镜子里看到了雷蒙诺克。”

“你说得不错，西卜太太。”病人又变得绵羊一般了。

“啊，你这才懂事啦……回头见，小宝宝，乖一点儿，我马上来的。”

邦斯听见大门一关上，便集中最后一些精力爬起来，心里想着：

“他们欺骗我！偷我东西！许模克是个孩子，会让人家捆起来装在袋里的！……”

他觉得刚才那可怕的一幕明明是真的，决不像幻觉；因为一心要求个水落石出，他居然挨到房门口，费了好大的劲把门打开，走进客厅。一看到心爱的画、雕像、佛罗伦萨的铜器、瓷器，他马上精神为之一振。食器柜和古董橱把客厅分成两半，拦做两条甬道；收藏家穿着睡衣，光着腿，脑袋在发烧，在甬道里绕了一转。他先把作品数了数，并没缺少。他正要退出来，忽然瞧见塞巴斯蒂亚诺·德尔·皮翁博的《玛德教士祈祷》给换了一张格勒兹的肖像。一有疑心，他头脑里立刻像雷雨将临的天上划了一道闪电。他把八幅名画的地位看了一遍，发觉全部调换了。可怜虫顿时眼前一黑，脚下一软，往地板上倒了下去。他这一晕简直人事不知，在地上躺了两小时；直到许模克睡醒了，从房里出来预备去看他朋友的时候方始发现。许模克好容易才把快死的病人抱起，放在床上给他睡好。可是他跟这个死尸般的朋友一说话，就发觉他目光冰冷，嘟嘟囔囔地不知回答些什么；这时德国人非但没有惊慌失措，倒反表现出英勇无比的友谊。给无可奈何的情形一逼，这孩子般的人居然有了灵感，像慈母或动了爱情的妇女一样。他把手巾烫热了（他也会找到手巾！）裹着邦斯的手，放在邦斯胸口，又把出着冷汗的脑门捧在自己手里。他拿出不下于古希腊哲人间波里奴斯·特·蒂阿纳的意志，把朋友的生命救了回来。他吻着朋友的眼睛，仿佛意大利雕塑家在《圣母哭子》的浮雕上表现玛丽亚亲吻基督。超人的努力，像慈母与情人一般的奋斗，把一个人的生命灌输给另一个人的结果，终于见了功效。半小时以后，邦斯的身体暖了，恢复了人样：眼睛有了神采，身上的暖气使身内的器官又活动起来。许模克拿着提神的药水和了酒，给邦斯喝了；生机传布到全身，早先像顽石一般毫无知觉的脑门上又发出点儿灵性。那时邦斯才明白，他能够苏生是靠了多么热烈的情意和多么了不起的友谊。

他觉得脸上给德国人洒满了眼泪，便说了句：“没有你，我早死了！”许模克在那里又是笑又是哭。他为了希望朋友开口，焦急的痛苦已经近于绝望；他已经筋疲力尽，所以一听到邦斯的话，就像破皮球似的泄了气。这一回是轮到他支持不住了，他把身子往沙发上倒了下去，合着手做了个极诚心的祷告感谢上帝。在他心目中，邦斯的复活是一个奇迹！他并不以为自己心中的愿望有什么作用，却相信一切都由于上帝的神力。其实这种奇迹是医生们常常看到的很自然的结果。

倘使有两个病情相仿的人，一个得到温情的安慰，有关切他生死存亡的人照顾，一个是由职业的看护服侍，那么一定是后者不治而前者得救的。这是人与人之间不由自主的交感作用；医生不愿意承认这一点，以为病人得救是由于服侍周到，由于严格听从医生的嘱咐；可是做母亲的都知道，持久的愿望的确有起死回生之力。

“亲爱的许模克！……”

“别说话，我能听到你的心的……你歇歇吧，歇歇吧！”老音乐家微笑着说。

“可怜的朋友！高尚的心胸！你是上帝的孩子，永远生活在上帝身上的！只有你爱我！……”邦斯断断续续地说话，有一种从来未有的音调。快要飞升的灵魂，整个儿都在这几句话里表现出来，许模克听了简直像体验到爱情似的，达于极乐的境界。

“你活呀！你活呀！我可以像狮子一样的勇猛，我一个人能养活两个人。”

“你听着，我的好朋友，我的忠实的、亲爱的朋友！你得让我说话，我快来不及了。我知道自己非死不可。受了这些接二连三的打击，怎么还能恢复？”

许模克哭得像孩子一样。

“你先听着，听完了再哭，”邦斯说，“别忘了你是基督徒，应当逆来顺受。我给人家偷盗了，而偷的人便是西卜女人……跟你分手之前，我得告诉你一些人情世故，你是完全不懂的……他们偷了我八张画，值到很大的一笔钱呢。”

“对不起，是我卖掉的……”

“你？……”

“是我……”可怜的德国人回答，“我们收到了法院的传票……”

“传票？……谁告了我们？……”

“你等一下！……”许模克说着，出去把执达吏交给他的公文拿了来。

邦斯仔仔细细地看过了，让公文在手里掉了下来，一声不出。他生平只知道观察人类的创作，从没注意到道德方面，这时才把西卜女人的诡计一桩桩地想起。于是他艺术家的谈吐，罗马学院时代的才气，又恢复了一刹那。

“许模克，我的好人，现在你得像小兵一样地服从我。你听着！你下去到门房里对那万恶的女人说，我要再见见我外甥派来的那个人，要是他不来，我就有意思把收藏送给博物院，因为我要立遗嘱了。”

许模克照着他的吩咐去做了；可是他才开口，西卜女人就笑了一笑：

“许模克先生，咱们亲爱的病人才发了一场恶热，说看到屋子里有人。我可以拿我的一生清白赌咒，咱们病人的亲属压根儿没有派什么人来……”

许模克一五一十把话回报了邦斯。

“想不到她这么厉害，这么奸刁，这么阴险，”邦斯微笑着说，“她扯谎直扯到自己的门房里去了！你知道吗，她今儿早上把一个叫作埃里·玛古斯的犹太人，雷蒙诺克，还有一个人我不认识，可是比其他两个更丑，带到这儿来。她预备趁我睡觉的时间估我的遗产，碰巧我醒过来，撞见他们三个拿着我的鼻烟壶正在估价。那陌生人自称为加缪索他们派来的，我跟他讲了话，无耻的西卜女人硬说我是做梦，可是许模克，我并没做梦！我明明听到那个人的声音，他和我说过话……至于那两个做买卖的，吃了一惊，当场溜了……我以为西卜女人会露马脚的……想不到我没有成功。我要另外做个圈套，教那坏女人上当！……可怜的朋友，你把西卜女人当作天使，哪知她一个月来为了贪心老是在折磨我，希望我快死。我本不愿意相信一个服侍我们多年的女人能坏到这地步。这一念之差，我把自己断送了……告诉我，那八张画，人家给了你多少钱？……”

“五千法郎。”

“天哪！它们至少值到二十倍！这是我全部收藏的精华。我来不及告到法院去了；并且你上了那些坏蛋的当，也得给牵涉进去……那就要了你的命！你不知道什么叫作司法！那是世界上的阴沟，集卑鄙龌龊之大成……看到那么些丑恶，像你那样的心灵是受不了的……何况你现在还有相当的财产。那八张画当初是我出四千法郎买来的，已经藏了三十六年……再说，他们偷盗的手段也真高明。我已经在坟墓边上了，心上只牵挂你一个人……你这个最好的好人。我所有的东西都是你的，我可不愿意你给人家偷盗。所以你得提防所有的人，可是你就从来不知道提防。我知道你有上帝保护；可是万一上帝把你忘了一刹那，你就得像条商船似的给海盗抢得精光了。西卜女人是个妖魔，她害了我的命！你还把她当作天使！我要叫你看看她的本相。你现在去托她介绍个公证人替我立遗嘱……然后我想法教你把她当场活捉……”

许模克听着邦斯的话好像听着天书。天底下会有西卜女人那样恶毒的人，倘使邦斯看得不错的话，那岂不是没有上帝了吗？

“可怜的邦斯情形很坏，”德国人到门房里对西卜太太说，“他想立遗嘱了；请你给找个公证人来……”

这话是当着好多人说的，因为西卜的病差不多没希望了，雷蒙诺克和他的姊妹，从隔壁过来的两个看门女人，房客们家里的三个老妈子，靠街的二层楼上的房客，都站在大门口。

“哦！你自己去找吧，”西卜女人含着一包眼泪叫道，“你们爱教哪个立遗嘱都可以……可怜的西卜快死了，我还离开他吗？……哪怕一百个邦斯我也不稀罕，我只要救我的西卜，唉，结婚三十年，他从来没有教我伤过一次心！……”

说完她走了进去，让许模克愣在那里。

“先生，”二楼的房客问，“邦斯先生的病真是很厉害吗？……”

这房客叫作姚里华，是法院登记处的职员。

“刚才差点儿死了！”许模克不胜痛苦地回答。

“靠近这儿，”姚里华接着说，“圣·路易街上有位德洛浓先生，他是本区的公证人。”

“要不要我替你去请呢？”雷蒙诺克问。

“好极了……”许模克回答，“我朋友病成这样，西卜太太又不能陪他，我就没法抽身啦……”

“西卜太太说他发疯了！……”姚里华又说。

“邦斯发疯？”许模克骇然叫起来，“嗬，他头脑比什么时候都灵活呢……我就担心是回光返照。”

周围所有的人当然很好奇，听着这些话，而且印象很深。

许模克是不认识弗莱齐埃的，也就没注意到那张撒旦式的脸和那双炯炯发光的眼睛。刚才那幕大胆的戏，也许超过了西卜女人的能力，实际上是弗莱齐埃在她耳边提了一句，在幕后主使的；可是她的表演的确非常精彩。当众宣告病人发疯，原是恶讼师为这篇文章预先安排好的伏笔。

早上的事弗莱齐埃有了准备；因为他要不在的话，老实的许模克下楼教西卜女人去请邦斯家属的代表的时候，她一时心慌意乱，也许会圆不过谎来。至于雷蒙诺克，他看见波冷医生来了，巴不得溜之大吉，原因是这样的——

五十八、不可恕的罪恶


十天以来，雷蒙诺克正在代行上帝的职司；这是法律所痛恨的，因为它认为赏罚大权应当由它包办才对。雷蒙诺克无论如何想摆脱他幸福的障碍。而他所谓的幸福是把妖娆的看门女人娶过来，使自己的资本增加三倍。他看见小裁缝喝着药茶，就有心把他无关紧要的病变为致命的绝症，而贩卖废铜烂铁的行业又给了他下手的方便。

一天早上，他靠着铺门抽着烟斗，正在想象玛特兰纳大街上的铺子，穿得漂漂亮亮的西卜太太坐镇在那儿……他忽然眼睛一转，看到一个氧化很厉害的圆铜片，大小像五法郎一枚的洋钱，便马上灵机一动，想很经济地用西卜的药茶把它洗干净。他在铜片上系了一根线，每天等西卜女人去服侍两位先生的时候，以探望他的裁缝朋友为名，过去坐上几分钟，把铜片浸入药茶，临走再提着线拿回去。俗称为铜绿的这些酸性的东西，使有益身体的药茶有了侵害身体的毒素，虽是分量极微，也产生了可惊的效果。从第三天起，可怜的西卜头发脱了，牙齿动摇了，身体上调节的机能都被这微乎其微的毒物破坏了。波冷医生看到药茶发生这种作用，不由得左思右想起来，因为他有相当学识，断定必有个破坏性的因素在那里作怪。他瞒着大家把药茶拿回去亲自化验，可是什么都没找到。因为那一天，雷蒙诺克看着自己的成绩也有点害怕了，没有把致命的铜片放进去。波冷医生对自己对科学的唯一的交代，只有认为在潮湿的门房里，整天伏在桌上，对着装有铁栅的窗子，长期枯坐的生活，可能使裁缝的血因为缺少运动而变质，何况还有阳沟的臭气永远把他熏着。诺曼底街是巴黎最老的街道之一，路面开裂，市政府还没装置公共的水龙头，家家户户的脏水都在乌黑的阳沟里慢腾腾地淌着，渗进街面：巴黎特有的那种泥浆便是这么来的。

西卜女人老是奔东奔西地活动着；工作勤奋的丈夫，却老对着窗洞像苦行僧一样地坐着。裁缝的膝盖，关节不灵活了，血都集中在上身；越来越瘦的腿扭曲了，差不多成为废物。所以大家久已认为西卜黄铜般的脸色是一种病态。而在医生眼中，老婆的强壮和丈夫的病病歪歪，更是势所必然的结果。

“我可怜的西卜害的是什么病呀？”看门女人问波冷医生。

“好西卜太大，他的病是当门房得来的……一般性的干枯憔悴，表示他害了不可救药的坏血症。”

波冷医生早先的疑心已经化解，因为他想到一个人犯罪必有目的，必有利害关系，而像西卜那样的人，谁又会害他的命呢？他的老婆吗？医生明明看到她替西卜的药茶加糖的时候，自己也喝上几口的。凡是逃过社会惩罚的许多命案，通常都因为像这一桩一样，表面上并没有暴行的证据，杀人不用刀枪、绳索、锤子那一类笨拙的方法，但尤其因为凶杀发生在下等阶级里面而并无显著的利害关系。罪案的暴露，往往是由于它的原因，或是仇恨，或是谋财，那是瞒不过周围的人的。但在小裁缝、雷蒙诺克与西卜女人的情形中，除了医生，谁也没有心思去推究死因。黄脸的病歪歪的门房，一方面老婆对他很好；一方面既无财产，又无敌人。旧货商的动机与痴情，西卜女人的横财，都是藏在暗里的。医生把看门女人和她的心事看得雪亮，认为她能折磨邦斯，可并没犯罪的动机与胆量；何况医生每次来，看她拿药茶递给丈夫的时候，她总还先尝一下。这案子本来只有波冷一个人能揭破，可是他以为病势的恶化完全是出于偶然，是一种不可思议的例外，就因为有这种例外，医生这一行才不容易对付。不幸裁缝平素萎靡不振的生活早已把他身子磨坏，所以受到一点儿轻量的铜绿就把命送掉了。而街坊上的邻居和多嘴的妇女，对他暴病身亡的不以为奇，也等于替雷蒙诺克开脱。

“啊！”一个邻居说，“我早说过西卜身体不行了。”

另外一个接口道：“他工作太多，这家伙！他火气上了头。”

“他不肯听我的话，”第三个又说，“我劝他星期日出去遛遛，另外也该停一天工，一礼拜玩两天也不能算多。”

街谈巷议往往是警察分局长破案的线索，司法当局也利用这个平民阶级的皇帝做耳目；如今关于西卜的舆论把他暴卒的原因完全给解释清楚，毫无可疑之处了。可是波冷若有所思的神气，烦躁不安的眼睛，使雷蒙诺克慌得厉害；所以他一看见医生来到，就向许模克自告奋勇，请弗莱齐埃认识的那个德洛浓去了。

“赶到立遗嘱的时候，我再来，”弗莱齐埃附在西卜女人的耳边说，“虽然你心里很难过，还得看着你的谷子。”恶讼师像影子一般轻飘飘地溜走了，半路上碰到他的医生朋友。

“喂，波冷，一切顺利，”他说，“咱们得救啦！……今晚上我把情形告诉你！你喜欢什么位置，早点儿打定主意吧，包在我身上！至于我哪，初级法庭庭长是稳的了！这一回我再向泰勃罗的女儿提亲，可不会被拒绝啦……我还要替你做媒，把那初级法庭庭长的孙女儿，维丹小姐介绍给你。”

波冷听着愣住了，弗莱齐埃把他丢在那里，像箭头似的直奔大街，对街车招了招手，十分钟之后就到了旭阿梭街的上段。那时大约四点钟，弗莱齐埃知道只有庭长夫人一个人在家，因为法官决不会在五点以前离开衙门。

玛维尔太太这次对他的另眼相看，证明勒勃夫先生对华蒂南太太的诺言已经兑现，替弗莱齐埃说过好话。阿曼丽招呼他的态度可以说近乎亲热了，当年蒙邦西哀公爵夫人对约各·格莱芒想必也是如此[1]；因为这个小律师是她的一把刀。玛古斯和雷蒙诺克共同署名写了封信，声明愿意出九十万现款承买邦斯的收藏，弗莱齐埃拿出这封信以后，庭长太太瞧着他的眼光可完全反映出那个数字，好比一道贪欲的巨流直冲到小律师面前。

“庭长先生要我约你明天来吃饭，”她说，“没有什么外客，不过是我的诉讼代理人台洛希的后任，高特夏先生；我的公证人贝蒂哀先生；还有小女和小婿……吃过饭，你，我，公证人，诉讼代理人，我们可以照你上次要求的办法谈一谈，同时我们要全权委托你。那两位一定能听从你的主意，帮你把那件事儿办妥。至于庭长先生的委托书，你需要的时候我随时可以交给你……”

“病人死的那一天我就用得着……”

“我们先给你准备好就是了。”

“庭长太太，我所以要求有份委托书，要求府上的诉讼代理人别出面，倒不是为了我，而是为了你们……我要替人出力的话，我是把自己整个儿贡献出来的。所以，太太，我希望我的保护人（我不敢把你们看作当事人），对我一样的忠实，一样的信任。您可能以为我这样做是要抓住生意；不是的，太太，不是的；如果出了点小小的乱子……因为在遗产案子里，尤其目标有九十万法郎的数目，一个人往往要给拖到……那时您总不能让高特夏先生那样的人为难，他的清白是无可批评的；可是对一个无名小卒的经纪人，您尽可把全部责任推在他头上……”

庭长太太望着弗莱齐埃，不觉深表佩服。她说：

“你将来不是爬得极高，便是跌得极重。我要是你，我才不眼红什么初级法庭庭长，我要上芒德去当一任检察官，大大地干一番。”

“您等着瞧吧，太太！初级法庭的位置对维丹先生是匹驽马，对我却是匹战马。”

这样谈着，庭长太太对弗莱齐埃说出了更进一步的心腹话。她说：“你既然这样关切我们的利益，我不妨让你知道我们的难处和希望。以前小女跟一个现在开着银行的油滑小子提亲的时候，庭长就有心扩充玛维尔产业，把当时有人出卖的几块牧场买下来。后来我们为了嫁女儿，把那美丽的庄子放手了，那是你知道的；可是我只有这个女儿，我还希望把剩下的牧场买进，因为一部分已经给别人买去。业主是个英国人，在那儿住了二十年，预备回国了。他盖着一所精致的别墅，风景极好，一边是玛维尔花园，一边是草地，这草地从前也是英国人的。他为了要起造大花园，曾经花了很多钱，把小树林和园亭等等大加修葺。这乡下别墅跟它附属的建筑物，正好衬托出四周的形胜，和我女儿的花园又只有一墙之隔。屋子连同牧场的价钱大概是七十万法郎，因为每年的净收入是两万……但要是华特曼先生知道我们想买，马上会多要二三十万，因为照乡下出卖田产的惯例，建筑物不算钱的话，他是有损失的……”

“可是，太太，您那份遗产可以说十拿九稳了；我有个主意在这儿，我能代您出面，用最低价买进那块地。我跟卖主的手续不用经过官方，像地产商一样办法……我不妨就用那个身份去跟英国人接洽。这种事我很内行，在芒德专门干这一套；华蒂南事务所的资本，就是这样增加了一倍，因为是我替他经手……”

“你跟华蒂南太太的关系敢情就是这么来的……那位公证人现在该很有钱啦？……”

“可是华蒂南太太也真会花……所以，太太，您放心，我一定替您把英国人收拾得服服帖帖……”

“你要办到这一点，那我真感激不尽了……再会，亲爱的弗莱齐埃先生，明儿见。”

弗莱齐埃临走时对庭长太太行的礼不像上次那样卑恭了。

“明儿我要在玛维尔庭长家吃饭了！”弗莱齐埃心里想，“得了，这些人都给我抓住了。不过要完全控制大局，还得利用初级法庭的执达吏泰勃罗，去间接支配那德国人。泰勃罗从前不愿意把独养女儿给我，我当了庭长就不怕他不肯了。红头发，高身量，害着肺病的泰勃罗小姐，从母亲手里承继了一所王家广场上的屋子，那我不是有被选资格了吗？将来她父亲死后，总还能有六千法郎一年的收入。她长得并不漂亮；可是天哪！从一文不名一跳跳到一万八千的进款，可不能再管脚下的跳板好看不好看啦！”

从大街上回到诺曼底街，他一路做着这些黄金梦：想到从此不愁衣食的快乐，也想到替初级法庭庭长的女儿维丹小姐做媒，攀给他的朋友波冷。跟医生合作之下，他可以在一区里称霸，控制所有的选举，不论是市里的，军队里的，中央的[2]。他一边走一边让自己的野心像奔马般地飞腾，大街的路程也就显得特别短了。

五十九、遗嘱人的妙计


许模克上楼回到朋友身边，告诉他西卜快死了，雷蒙诺克请德洛浓公证人去了。邦斯听着不由得一怔，以前西卜女人滔滔不竭地跟他胡扯的时候，常常提到这名字，说那公证人如何如何诚实，要介绍给他。病人从早上起已经满腹狐疑，这时更恍然大悟，使他那个捉弄西卜女人，向轻信的许模克把她完全揭穿的计划，给修正得更完满了。

“许模克，”他拿着他的手说，可怜的德国人被这么多的新闻这么多的事搅糊涂了，“屋子里要乱起来了；倘若西卜快死，咱们就可以有一忽儿的自由，就是说可以暂时摆脱一下奸细，因为人家一定在那里刺探我们。你出去，雇一辆车上戏院，找哀络依思小姐，告诉她我临死之前想见她一面，希望她十点半完场以后到这儿来。你再去找你的朋友希华勃和勃罗纳，约他们明儿早上九点来看我，要做得像走过这儿顺便来的……”

老艺术家自知不久人世之后所定的计划是这样的：他要使许模克有钱，指定他为全部遗产的继承人；而为预防人家跟德国人捣乱起见，他预备当着见证把遗嘱口述给公证人，令人不能说他精神错乱，而加缪索他们也找不到借口来攻击他对遗产的处分。听到德洛浓的名字，他认为其中必有阴谋：先是公证人可能把遗嘱订得不合法定方式，使它失效；其次，西卜女人一定有心出卖他，早就定下什么诡计。他就想将计就计，教德洛浓口授一份遗嘱，由他亲笔书写，封固，藏在柜子的抽斗内。然后他打算要许模克躲入床后的小房间，把西卜女人来偷遗嘱，拆开来念过了再封好等等的勾当，一一看在眼里。然后，明天早上九点，他另外请个公证人，立一份合格的无可批驳的遗嘱，把昨天那份撤销。一知道西卜女人在外边说他发疯，说他白日见鬼，他就觉得背后必有庭长太太的深仇宿恨在作怪，她既要报复，又要谋他的财产；因为两个月以来，可怜虫躺在床上失眠的时候，长时间孤独的时候，把一生的事都细细温过一遍了。

古往今来的雕塑家，往往在坟墓两旁设计两个手执火把的神像。这些火把，除了使黄泉路上有点儿亮光之外，同时照出亡人的过失与错误。在这一点上，雕塑的确刻画出极深刻的思想，说明了一个合乎人性的事实。临终的痛苦自有它的智慧。我们常常看到一般普通的年纪轻轻的姑娘，头脑会像上百岁的老人一样，她们能预言未来，批判家人，决不给虚情假意蒙蔽。这是死亡带来的伟大。而值得注意的是，人的死有两种不同的方式。洞烛过去或预言未来那样的能力，只限于因躯壳受伤，因肉体生活遭到破坏而致命的人。凡是害坏疽病的，例如路易十四；或是害肺病的，或是发高热的，例如邦斯；或是患胃病的，例如莫索夫太太；或是生龙活虎般的人中了重伤，例如兵士，这种人就能洞察幽微，死得奇特，死得神妙；至于另外一些病人，可以说病在理智，病在头脑，病在替肉身与思想作媒介的神经组织的，他们的死是整个儿死的，精神与肉体同时毁灭的。前者是没有肉体的灵魂，像圣经中所说的精灵；后者只是死尸。邦斯这个童贞的男子，这个贪嘴的道学家，这个端方正直的完人，很晚才参透庭长夫人胸中那股怨毒之气。他直到快离开尘世的时候才了解尘世。所以从几小时以来，他高高兴兴地打定了主意，仿佛一个生性快活的艺术家，觉得一切都可以拿来做插科打诨、嬉笑怒骂的材料。他与人生最后的联系，爱美的热情，鉴赏家对艺术品的留恋，从那天早上起也斩断了。一发觉给西卜女人偷盗之后，邦斯对艺术的浮华与虚幻，对自己的收藏，对创造那些神奇的作品的作者，决意告别了；他一心只想到死，并且像我们的祖先一样，把死看作基督徒的一个快乐的归宿。唯有他对许模克的友爱，使他还想在身后保护他；所以他要找哀络依思来帮助他对付那些坏蛋，他知道他们不但眼前在包围他，将来还不肯放过他的受赠人。

哀络依思·勃里斯多，颇像贞妮·凯婷与玉才华一流[1]，身份虽然不上不下，人倒是挺真的：她一方面不择手段，玩弄一切出钱买笑的崇拜者；一方面却很够朋友，什么权势都不怕，因为她看穿了人的弱点。而在玛皮伊舞会与狂欢节中间，跟巴黎警察对垒的阵势，她也见得多了。

“她既然把我的位置给了迦朗育，她一定觉得更应该帮我的忙。”

门房里情形混乱，许模克出去竟没有人发觉；他极快地赶回来，唯恐邦斯一个人在家里耽得太久。

德洛浓和许模克同时来到。虽然西卜快死了，他的女人还是陪着公证人上楼，带进卧房；然后她自动退了出去，让许模克、德洛浓和邦斯三个人在屋里。但她把房门开着一点，手中拿了一面很巧妙的小镜子站在门口。这样，她不但能听见，还能看到屋内的情形，因为这一刻工夫是她的重要关头。

邦斯对德洛浓说：“先生，我不幸神志很清楚，因为我觉得自己要死了；大概由于上帝的意志，死亡的痛苦我一桩都不能幸免！……这一位是许模克先生……”

公证人向许模克行了礼。

邦斯又道：“他是我世界上唯一的朋友，我要指定他为全部遗产的继承人；他是德国人，对我们的法律完全不懂的。请你告诉我，遗嘱应该用什么方式，我的朋友才能执管遗产而不致受人家反对。”

“先生，”公证人回答，“天下没有一件事不可以反对的，所谓法律就有这点儿麻烦。可是在遗嘱的范围内，也有批驳不倒的……”

“请问是哪样的遗嘱呢？”

“那是当着公证人和见证立的遗嘱。有了见证就能证明遗嘱人的神志完全清楚，而如果遗嘱人没有妻子儿女，没有父亲，没有弟兄……”

“这些我都没有，我全部感情都在我亲爱的朋友许模克身上……”

许模克听着哭了。

“根据法律，倘若你只有旁系远亲，你就可以自由处分你的动产与不动产。但遗嘱的行为不能与道德抵触。想必你也看到过，有些遗嘱受到攻击是因为遗嘱人措置乖张。但当着公证人立的遗嘱是推翻不了的。因为这样，人家不能说遗嘱是伪造的，遗嘱人的精神状态有公证人鉴定，而遗嘱人的签字也绝无争辩的余地……除此以外，凡是意义清楚、合乎法定方式的自书遗嘱，也同样不容易推翻。”

“那么我根据我的理由，决定请你口授遗嘱，由我亲笔写下来，交给我的朋友……你说这么办行不行？……”

“行！……你写吧，我来念……”

“许模克，把我那个布勒小墨水缸拿过来。”——“先生，请你念的时候声音放低一些，可能有人偷听。”

“把你的意思先告诉我吧。”公证人说。

十分钟之后，许模克点起一支蜡烛，公证人把遗嘱仔细看过，封固，由邦斯交给许模克，要他放在书桌的一只暗抽屉内；然后邦斯把书桌的钥匙系在手帕上，放在枕头底下。这些情形，西卜女人都看在眼里，而邦斯在大镜子内也把她看在眼里。遗嘱人为表示礼貌起见，指定公证人为遗嘱执行人，又遗赠他一幅名贵的画，那是公证人在法律范围内可以接受的。德洛浓出来在客厅内碰到了西卜女人。

“喂，先生，邦斯先生有没有想到我呀？”

“好太太，你总不至于要公证人泄露当事人的秘密吧？”德洛浓回答，“我只能告诉你，多少人的贪心和希望这一下都完事大吉。邦斯先生的遗嘱通情达理，极有爱国心，我非常赞成。”

这几句话把西卜女人的好奇心刺激到什么程度，简直难以想象。她下楼去替西卜守夜，打算等会教雷蒙诺克小姐来替代她，以便在清早两三点钟去偷看遗嘱。

六十、假遗嘱


哀络依思·勃里斯多小姐晚上十点半来拜访，西卜女人并不觉得奇怪；但她很怕舞女提到高狄沙给的一千法郎，所以她对客人的礼貌与巴结，好似招待什么王后一般。哀络依思一边上楼一边说：

“啊！亲爱的，你在这儿比进戏院好多啦，我劝你还是把这个差事干下去吧！”

哀络依思是由她的知心朋友皮克西渥坐着车送来的，她浓妆艳服，因为要赴歌剧院的红角儿玛丽哀德的晚会。二楼的房客，从前在圣·特尼街开绣作铺的夏波罗先生，带着太太和女儿，刚从滑稽剧院回来，在楼梯上遇到这样漂亮的装束这样漂亮的人物，都不由得吃了一惊。

“这位是谁呀，西卜太太？”夏波罗太太问。

“是个贱货！……你只要花四十铜子，就可以看到她每天晚上光着身子跳舞……”看门女人咬着房客的耳朵回答。

“维多莉，你让太太先走！”夏波罗太太吩咐女儿。

哀络依思完全明白做母亲的这样大惊小怪地叫嚷是什么意思，便回过头来说：“太太，你家小姐难道比艾绒还容易着火，你怕她一碰到我就会烧起来吗？……”

哀络依思笑盈盈地对夏波罗先生飞了一眼。“嗯，不错，她下了台倒真漂亮！”夏波罗先生说着，站在了楼梯台上。夏波罗太太把丈夫使劲拧了一把，使他痛得直叫，顺手把他拉进了屋子。

“哼！”哀络依思说，“这里的三楼简直像五楼一样。”

“小姐可是爬高爬惯的呢。”西卜女人一边说一边替她开门。

哀络依思走进卧房，看见可怜的音乐家躺着，瘦削的脸上血色全无。

“喂，朋友，还是不行吗？戏院里大家都在牵挂你；可是你知道，光有好心也没用，各人忙着各人的事，简直抽不出一个钟点去看朋友。高狄沙天天都说要上这儿来，可天天为了经理室的琐碎事儿分身不开。不过我们心里都对你很好……”

“西卜太太，”病人说，“你走开一下好不好，我们要跟小姐谈谈戏院的事，商量我的位置问题……回头许模克会送小姐出去的。”

许模克看见邦斯对他递了个眼色，便推着西卜女人出去，把门销插上了。

西卜女人一听见锁门声，就对自己说：“嘿！这混账的德国人，他也学坏了，他！……这些缺德事儿一定是邦斯教他的……好吧，你们瞧我的吧……”西卜女人自言自语地下楼，“管他！要是跳舞女人提到一千法郎什么的，我就说是戏子们开的玩笑。”

她去坐在西卜床头。西卜嘟囔着说胃里热得像一团火；因为他女人不在的时候，雷蒙诺克又给他喝过了药茶。

邦斯在许模克送出西卜女人的时间，对舞女说：“亲爱的孩子，我有件事只信托你一个人，就是请你介绍一位诚实可靠的公证人，要他准明天上午九点半到这儿来，给我立遗嘱。我要把全部财产送给我的朋友许模克。万一这可怜的德国人受到欺侮的话，我希望那公证人能做他的顾问，做他的保护人。因此我要找一个极有地位极有钱的公证人，不至于像一般吃法律饭的，为了某些顾虑而轻易屈服；我可怜的继承人将来是要倚靠他的。我就不相信加陶的后任贝蒂哀，你交游极广……”

“哦！有了有了！弗洛丽纳和勃吕哀伯爵夫人的公证人雷沃博·汉纳耿，不是行了吗？他是个道学家，从来不跟什么交际花来往！你找到他仿佛找到了一个父亲，你自己挣的钱，他也不许你乱花；我把他叫作吝啬鬼的祖宗，因为我所有的女朋友都给他教得省俭了。告诉你，第一，他除了事务所以外，一年有六万法郎进款。第二，他这个公证人完全是老派的公证人！他走路，睡觉，随时随地都忘不了公证人身份；大概他生的儿女也是些小公证人吧……他顽固，迂执，可是办起事来决不对权势低头……他从来没养过女人，好做家长的标本！太太对他挺好，也不欺骗他，虽然是公证人太太……要讲到公证人，巴黎没有更好的了；就像古时的长老一样。他不像加陶对玛拉迦那么有趣；可也不会溜之大吉，像跟安多尼亚同居的那小子！我教他明儿早上八点钟来……你放心睡觉吧。希望你的病快点儿好，再替我们写些美丽的音乐；可是，人生的确没意思，经理们讨价还价，国王们横征暴敛，部长们操纵投机，有钱的一钱如命……干戏剧的连这个都没有啦！”她说着拍了拍心窝，“这年月真是活不下去……再见吧，朋友！”

“哀络依思，我第一要求你严守秘密。”

“这不是舞台上的玩意儿，”她说，“我们做戏的，嘿，把这种事看得很重呢。”

“孩子，你现在的后台是谁呀？”

“你这一区的区长蒲杜伊哀，像故世的克勒凡一样的蠢家伙；你知道，高狄沙的股东克勒凡，几天之前死了，什么都没留给我，连一瓶头发油都没有[1]。所以我说咱们这时代真没出息。”

“他怎么死的？”

“死在他女人手里！……要是他不离开我，还不照常活着吗？再见，好朋友！我毫不忌讳地跟你提到死，因为我料你不消半个月，一定会在大街上溜达，捡些小古董小玩意儿；你没有什么病，我从来没见过你眼睛这么精神……”

舞女走了，知道她堂兄弟迦朗育的乐队指挥是稳的了……

每层楼上都有人开出门来瞧这位头牌舞女。她的出现轰动了整个屋子。

舞女走到大门口招呼开门的时候，弗莱齐埃像条斗牛狗咬到了东西死不放松，正待在门房里守着西卜女人。他知道遗嘱已经立了，特意来探探看门女人的意思；因为德洛浓对他像对西卜女人一样，一点消息不肯透露。恶讼师不免把舞女瞧了一眼，决意要使他这最后关头的访问有点儿结果。

“亲爱的西卜太太，你事情紧急啦。”

“唉，是啊，可怜的西卜！……将来我发了财，他可享受不到了，想到这个，我……”

“可是先得知道邦斯先生有没有留给你什么，就是说遗嘱上有没有你的名字。我是代表血亲继承人，当然反对邦斯的处分；总而言之，你只能指望我的当事人给你一些好处……听说那遗嘱是自己写的，所以很容易推翻……你知道放在哪儿？”

“放在书桌的抽斗里，他把钥匙缚在手帕上，藏在枕头底下……我看得清清楚楚。”

“遗嘱有没有封起来？”

“哎啊！封起来的呀。”

“偷盗遗嘱把它灭迹，固然是很重的刑事，但私下看一看不过是很轻的罪名；老实说，那也没有什么大不了，反正没人看见你！老头儿睡觉是不是睡得很熟的？……”

“睡是睡得很熟的；可是早上你要把每样东西都看到，估个价钱的时候，他明明睡得像死人一样，谁想到他会醒的……可是我得去瞧瞧！天亮四点钟，我去跟许模克换班，你要愿意来，可以有十分钟的时间看到遗嘱……”

“行！就这么办。我四点钟来轻轻地敲门……”

“等会雷蒙诺克小姐代我陪西卜，我先通知她教她开门；你只要敲敲窗子，免得惊动旁人。”

“好吧，你先把火预备好，是不是？一支蜡烛就够了……”

半夜左右，可怜的德国人坐在沙发里，不胜悲痛地端详着邦斯。邦斯像垂危的人一样满脸皱痕，他经过了那天多少的刺激，疲倦不堪，仿佛快断气了。

“我想我这点精力只能撑到明天下午，”邦斯很洒脱地说，“明天晚上，我大概要入于弥留状态了。许模克，等公证人和你两个朋友来过以后，你去把圣·法朗梭阿教堂的杜泼朗蒂神父请来。这位好人不知道我病了，我希望明天中午受临终圣体……”

他停了半晌又说：“上帝不愿意给我理想的生活。我要有个女人，有些孩子，有个家庭的话，我会多么爱他们！……我的野心不过是躲在一边，有几个亲人爱我！……每个人都觉得人生是场空梦，我看到有些人，凡是我希望不到的都齐备了，可也并不快乐……慈悲的上帝使我晚年有了意想不到的安慰，给我一个像你这样的朋友！……亲爱的许模克，我自问没有误解你，完全体会到你的优点，我把我的心，把我的友爱都给了你……你别哭，要不然我就不说了！可是和你谈谈我们的事，我心里多快乐……要是听了你的话，我就不会死了。我应当脱离社会，戒掉我的习惯，那就不至于受到奇耻大辱，把我的命送掉了，现在我只想料理你的事……”

“你不用费这个心！……”

“别跟我争，你听着我，好朋友……你天真，坦白，像从来没有离开过母亲的五六岁的孩子，这是了不起的；我看上帝会亲自照顾你这一类的人。可是世界上的人心术多坏，我应当教你提防他们。你的轻信是胸怀高洁的表现，唯有天才和像你那样的心灵才会有，可是你这些纯洁的信心马上要丧失了。你要看到西卜太太来偷我这份假遗嘱，你不知道她刚才在半开的门里始终在偷看我们……我料定那坏女人要在天亮的时候下手，以为那时你是睡着的。你得仔细听我的话，我说什么你都得照办，一点不能含糊……听见没有？”病人又问了一句。

六十一、大失所望


被痛苦压倒的许模克，心跳得可怕，脑袋仰在椅背上，好似昏迷了。

“是的，我听见的！可是你的声音远得很……我好像跟你一块儿陷到坟墓里去了！……”德国人说着，难过到极点。

他过去捧着邦斯的手，很诚心地做了个祈祷。

“你念念有词地用德文说些什么呀？……”

祷告完了，他很简单地回答：“我求上帝把我们俩一块儿召回去。”

邦斯忍着胸口的疼痛，勉强探出身子，挨近许模克去亲他的额角，把自己的灵魂灌注给这个上帝脚下的羔羊，表示祝福。

“喂，听我呀，亲爱的许模克，快死的人的话，是非听从不可的……”

“我听着！”

“你知道，你的屋子跟我的屋子中间有个小房间，西边都有扇小门。”

“不错，可是里头全堆满了画。”

“你马上去轻轻地把门的地位腾出来！……”

“好吧……”

“你先把两边的过道出清，再把你那儿的门虚掩着。等西卜女人来跟你换班的时候（今天她可能提早一个钟点），你照常去睡觉，要做出很疲倦的神气。你得装作睡熟……只要她在椅子里坐下了，你就从门里走进我的小房间，把玻璃门上的窗纱撩开一点，留神看着这儿的动静……明白没有？”

“明白了。你的意思是那个坏女人要来烧掉遗嘱……”

“我不知道她要怎么办，反正以后你不会再拿她当作天使了。现在我要听听音乐，你来临时作些曲子让我享受一下……这样你心有所归，不至于太愁闷；而你的诗意也可以替我排遣这凄凉的一夜……”

许模克就开始弹琴了。悲痛的激动和反应所唤起的音乐灵感，不消几分钟，就像往常一样把德国人带到了另外一个世界。他找到些意境高远的主题，任意发挥，时而凄怆沉痛，委婉动人如肖邦；时而慷慨激昂，气势雄壮如李斯特：这是最接近帕格尼尼的两个音乐家。演技的完美到这一步，演奏家差不多与诗人并肩了；他与作曲家的关系，好比演员之于编剧：神妙的内容有了神妙的表现。那晚上，邦斯仿佛预先听到了天国的音乐，连音乐家的祖师圣女赛西尔也为之废然若失的神奇的音乐。许模克这一下是等于贝多芬而兼帕格尼尼，是创造者同时是表演者。涓涓不尽的乐思，像夜莺的歌喉，崇高伟大像夜莺头上的青天，精深宏博像夜莺在那里千啼百啭的丛林：他从来没有这样精彩的表现。邦斯听得悠然神往，有如博洛尼亚美术馆中那幅拉斐尔画上的情景。不料这团诗意给一阵粗暴的铃声打断了。二楼房客的老妈子，奉主人之命来请许模克停止吵闹。夏波罗先生，夏波罗太太，夏波罗小姐，都给吵醒了，没法再睡；他们认为戏院里的音乐白天尽有时间练习，而在玛莱区的屋子里也不该在夜里弹琴……那时已经三点了。到三点半，不出邦斯所料——他仿佛亲耳听见弗莱齐埃和西卜女人的约会的——看门女人出现了。病人对许模克会心地望了一眼，意思是说：“你瞧，我不是猜着了吗？”然后他装作睡得很熟的模样。

一个人的老实最容易使人上当，儿童的卖弄狡狯就利用他的天真烂漫做手段，而且往往是成功的。西卜女人绝对相信许模克是老实人，所以看他悲喜交集地走过来对她说话，一点也不疑心他扯谎。

“哎啊！他这一夜情形坏透了！烦躁不堪，像着了魔似的。我只得给他弹弹琴使他安静；想不到二楼的房客跑来叫我停止！……真正岂有此理！那是为救我朋友性命呀。我弹了一夜琴，累死了，到今儿早上简直撑不住啦。”

“我可怜的西卜情形也不好，今儿要再像昨天一样，就没希望了！……有什么法儿！只能听上帝的意思！”

“你人多老实，心多好，要是西卜老头死了，咱们住在一块儿！”狡狯的许模克说。

朴实正直的人作假的时候，会像儿童一样可怕，做的陷阱跟野蛮人做的一样精密。

“得啦，小乖乖，去睡吧！”西卜女人说，“瞧你眼睛多累，像核桃一样了。能跟你这样的好人一块儿养老，那我丢了西卜，还算有点安慰。放心，我会把夏波罗太太去训一顿的！……嘿，卖针线出身的女人也配拿架子吗！……”

这样以后，许模克就躲进了他的小房间。

西卜女人把大门虚掩着，弗莱齐埃溜了进来，轻轻地把门关上了，那时许模克已经走进自己屋子。律师拿着一支点着的蜡烛和一根极细的铜丝，预备拆遗嘱用的。病人有心让缚着钥匙的手帕露在长枕头外面，身子朝着墙，睡的姿势使西卜女人拿起手帕来格外方便。她拿了钥匙走向书桌，尽量轻手轻脚地开了锁，摸到抽斗的暗机关，抓着遗嘱到客厅去了。邦斯看见这情形骇坏了。许模克却从头到脚在那里哆嗦，仿佛他自己犯了什么罪。

“你回进屋子去，”弗莱齐埃从西卜女人手里接过遗嘱，吩咐她，“他要醒来，应当看见你坐在屋里才对。”

弗莱齐埃拆开封套的熟练，证明他已经不是初犯。他念着这古怪的文件，不由得大为惊异。

立自书遗嘱人邦斯，兹因自本年二月初患病以来，病势有增无减，自知不久人世，决将所有遗产亲自处分。余神志清楚，可以本遗嘱内容为证。又本遗嘱系会同公证人德洛浓先生拟定。

余素以历代名画聚散无常，卒至澌灭为恨。此等精品往往转辗贩卖，周游列国，从不能集中一地，以饱爱美人士眼福，尤为可慨。窃以为名家杰作均应归国家所有，俾能经常展览，公诸同好，一如上帝创造之光明永远为万民所共享。

余毕生搜集若干画幅，均系大家手迹，面目完整，绝未经过后人窜改或重修。此项图画为余一生幸福所在，极不愿其在余身后再经拍卖，流散四方，或为俄人所得，或入英人之手，使余过去搜集之功化为乌有。所有画框，均出名工巧匠之手，余亦不忍见其流离失所。

职是之故，余决将藏画全部遗赠国王，捐入卢浮宫博物馆。遗赠条件即受赠人必须对余友人威廉·许模克负担每年二千四百法郎之终身年金。

倘或国王以卢浮宫博物馆之代表人资格，不愿接受上述条件之遗赠，则该项图画当即遗赠余友人许模克。至图画以外之其他物件，本不在捐入公家之列，亦一并赠予许模克，但受赠人必须负责将谷雅所作《猴头》一画，致送与余外甥加缪索庭长；将弥浓所作花卉《郁金香》一幅，致送与公证人德洛浓先生。余并指定德洛浓先生为遗嘱执行人。又许模克当以二百法郎之年金，赠予为余服役十年之西卜太太。

余并委托友人许模克将鲁本斯所作《放下十字架》一画，赠予本区教堂，以表余对杜泼朗蒂神父之谢意。余临终深感杜神父指导，俾余得以基督徒身份魂归天国。（下略）

一八四五年四月十五日　邦斯（签名）

“这可完了蛋！”弗莱齐埃对自己说，“我所有的希望都完了蛋！啊！庭长夫人说老头儿如何如何奸刁，我这才相信了！……”

“怎么呢？”西卜女人走来问。

“你的先生真不是人！把全部东西送给了国家美术馆。咱们可不能跟政府打官司！……这遗嘱是推翻不了的。咱们真是遇到了贼，给偷盗了，抢光了，要了命了！……”

“他给我什么？”

“两百法郎终身年金……”

“哎啊！他手面这样阔！……这十恶不赦的坏蛋！……”

“你去看着他，”弗莱齐埃说，“我得把你那个坏蛋的遗嘱给封起来。”





六十二、初次失风


西卜太太一转背，弗莱齐埃赶紧拿张白纸袋入封套，把遗嘱藏在自己袋里；然后他很巧妙地重新封固，等西卜太太再来的时候给她瞧，问她可看得出痕迹。西卜女人接过封套，摸了摸，觉得遗嘱还在里头，不禁深深地叹了口气。她本来希望弗莱齐埃把该死的文件烧掉的。

“唉，亲爱的弗莱齐埃先生，怎么办呢？”她问。

“哦！那是你的事！我不是继承人；我要对这些东西有权利的话，”他指着屋里的收藏，“我当然知道怎么办的……”

“我就是问你这个啊……”西卜女人愣头傻脑地说。

“壁炉里有的是火……”他说着站起身来预备走了。

“不错，这件事只有你我两个人知道是不是？……”

“谁能证明有过什么遗嘱的！”律师说。

“那么你预备怎么办？”

“我吗？……倘若邦斯先生死后没有遗嘱，我担保你到手十万法郎。”

“哼，对啦！”她说，“你们总是金山银山地答应人家；赶到东西一到手，要付钱了，你们就赖个精光，像……”

她差点儿说溜了嘴，把埃里·玛古斯的事对弗莱齐埃说出来……

“我得走了！”弗莱齐埃说，“为你着想，不应该让人家看见我在这儿；咱们在门房里见吧。”

西卜女人关上大门，拿着遗嘱回进来，打定主意要把它扔在火里了；可是她进了卧房走向壁炉的时候，忽然给两条胳膊抓住了！……她发觉邦斯与许模克一边一个站在她两旁。他们原来靠着房门，把身子贴在墙上等着她。

“啊！”西卜女人叫了一声。她合着身子扑倒在地上，丑态百出地浑身抽搐，也没人知道她是真是假。这模样给邦斯的刺激，使他差不多要死过去了，吓得许模克丢下西卜女人，赶紧扶着邦斯上床。两位朋友浑身发抖，就像一些人好不容易地做了件大事而把气力用过了头，赶到邦斯睡下，许模克的精力恢复了一点的时候，他听见了哭声。原来西卜女人跪在地上，流着眼泪，伸着手，做出种种表情向两位朋友哀求。

她看见两人注意她了，便说：“哎唷！我的好邦斯先生！那完全是好奇心呀。女人就是这个毛病，你知道！可是我没法拆开来念，就给你拿回来了！……”

“你滚吧！”许模克猛地站起身子，义愤填胸，一下子变得威严起来，“你是畜生！想害我邦斯的命。他没有冤枉你！你不但是畜生，还该入地狱！”

西卜女人看见天真的德国人满脸厌恶的表情，马上像答尔丢夫一般扬着脸站起身子走了，临走又瞪了许模克一眼，把他吓得心惊肉跳。出门之前，她顺手捡了一幅曼殊作的小画藏在衣兜里。她听见玛古斯赞不绝口地说过那张画是“一宝”。她在门房里碰到了弗莱齐埃；他在那儿等着，只希望西卜女人把那个封套跟里面那张白纸都给烧了；一看见当事人神色慌张，他不由得吃了一惊。

“出了什么事啦？”

“亲爱的弗莱齐埃先生，你给我出的好主意！你说是指导我，结果教我把两位先生的年金和信任统统丢了……”

于是她又拿出她的看家本领，滔滔滚滚的话像开了水闸。

“废话少说，”弗莱齐埃冷冷地把她拦住了，“快点讲事实！事实！”

“好吧，你听我的事实……”她就把经过情形一五一十说了一遍。

“我并没使你损失什么，”弗莱齐埃回答，“那两位先生早已在疑心你了，要不怎会做这个圈套呢？他们早等着你，私下在注意你！……哼，敢情你还有些事瞒着我！”律师补上这句的时候，虎视眈眈地把门房女人瞪了一眼。

“咱们一同干过了那样的事……你还说我瞒着你什么！……”她说着，打了个寒噤。

“哎，好太太，我又没做什么不正当的事！”弗莱齐埃这句话，明明表示他不承认去过邦斯的屋子。

西卜女人觉得头发根里有团火，浑身上下却是冻了冰。

“怎么？……”她完全呆住了。

“你这不是担了天大的罪名吗？……人家可以告你毁灭遗嘱。”弗莱齐埃冷冷地回答她。

西卜女人马上大惊失色。

“放心吧，我是你的顾问。我不过给你证明，要做到我以前跟你说过的话是多么容易，不论用什么方法。告诉我，你究竟干了些什么事，会教那天真的德国人瞒着你躲在屋子里的？……”

“我又没有做什么，除非是昨天我说了邦斯先生见神见鬼。从此他们俩对我的态度完全变了。所以还是你害了我，因为倘若邦斯先生不相信我，德国人我还是拿得住的，他已经说起要娶我，或是带我一起走，那不是一样吗？”

这理由相当充分，弗莱齐埃没法再逼她了。

“不用怕，我答应你的年金决不赖。至此为止，这件事里头一切还只是个假定，从现在起，就跟现钞一样啦……你一千二的终身年金是少不了的……可是亲爱的西卜太太，你得完全听我的命令，而且要应付得好。”

“是的，弗莱齐埃先生。”看门女人低声下气地答应，表示她又给收服了。

“那么再会吧。”弗莱齐埃身上带着那份危险的遗嘱，离开了门房。

他很高兴地回家，因为那张遗嘱是个极厉害的武器。他心里想：

“现在我可有了保障，不怕庭长夫人反悔了。她要不履行条件，就得丢掉她的遗产。”





六十三、荒唐的提议


天刚亮，雷蒙诺克开了铺门，由姊妹在那里看着，他照最近几天的习惯，过去看他的好朋友西卜了。西卜女人正打量着曼殊的画，心里奇怪怎么一块涂了颜色的小小的木板能值那么多钱。雷蒙诺克掩在西卜女人背后，从她肩膀上望过去，说道：

“哦呵！玛古斯因为没有能弄到这一张还在嘀咕；他说有了这件小玩意儿，就一辈子心满意足啦。”

“他愿意出多少呢？”

“你要答应做了寡妇以后嫁给我，我担保替你向玛古斯弄到两万法郎；要不然你这张画卖起来永远不会超过一千。”

“为什么？”

“因为你得以物主的身份开一张发票，那就得给继承人告上啦。倘若你是我的老婆，由我出面卖给玛古斯，我们做买卖的只要在进货簿上有笔账就行了，我可以写做是许模克卖给我的。得了吧，还是把画儿放在我家里……你丈夫一死，你就麻烦啦，不比我铺子里有张画，谁也不会奇怪……你是知道我的。再说，你要不相信，我可以给你一张收据。”

贪心的看门女人觉得自己犯的案给人拿住了，只得接受他的提议，而从此就摆脱不了这旧货商的束缚。

她把画往柜子里藏起，说道：“你的话不错，你就写个字条来吧。”

“邻居啊，”旧货商把西卜女人拉到门口，低声地说，“咱们的朋友西卜明明是没救的了；波冷医生昨天晚上就说没有希望，挨不过今天的……这当然是你大大的不幸！不过，话得说回来，这儿也不是你住的地方，你应当坐在加波西大街上一家漂亮的古董铺里。告诉你，我十年工夫，挣了近十万法郎，倘使有朝一日，你也有那么多钱，我担保替你好好地挣笔家私……只要你做我的老婆……将来你是老板娘啦……还有我的姊妹服侍你，替你打杂，而且……”

这一篇勾引的话给小裁缝一阵哼唧打断了，他已经到了临终的阶段。

“你走吧，”西卜女人说，“你真不是东西，我丈夫快死了，还跟我讲这种话……”

“啊！因为我爱你，把什么都忘了，一心只想得到你……”

“你要是爱我，这时候一句话都不应该说。”她回答。

于是雷蒙诺克踱回自己的铺子，知道跟西卜女人结婚是没有问题的了。

十点左右，大门四周乱成一片，因为西卜在受临终圣体了。西卜夫妇所有的朋友，诺曼底街和近段几条街上的看门的，挤满了门房、大门口的过道和街面。所以希华勃和勃罗纳，汉纳耿和他的一个同事先后来到的时候，谁也没注意，西卜女人更是看不见。隔壁屋子的看门女人，听见公证人问她邦斯住在哪一层，便指给他看了。勃罗纳从前来看过邦斯的收藏，这一回便不声不响，带着他的朋友往里直奔……邦斯把昨天的遗嘱正式撤销，另外立了一份，指定许模克为全部遗产的继承人。手续办完，邦斯谢过了希华勃与勃罗纳，又把许模克的利益郑重托付了汉纳耿，他就精神不济，衰弱到极点，因为半夜里对付西卜女人的那一场，刚才的吩咐后事等等，把他精力用尽了。许模克看到这种情形，不愿意再分身，就托希华勃去通知杜泼朗蒂神父，因为邦斯已经要求受临终圣体了。

西卜女人坐在丈夫床边，不再顾问许模克的饭食，而且她也给两位朋友撵走了。至于许模克，为了清早的事，又眼看朋友泰然自若地忍着临终苦难，心中悲恸欲绝，根本不觉得饥饿。

可是到下午两点光景，看门女人因为不看见德国人，又好奇又放心不下自己的利益，便托雷蒙诺克的姊妹，去问许模克可要点儿什么。那时杜泼朗蒂神父听完了邦斯的忏悔，正在举行临终的抹油体。雷蒙诺克小姐再三再四地拉着门铃，把这个仪式给扰乱了。可是邦斯怕人来偷东西，早已教许模克发过誓，对谁都不开门。雷蒙诺克小姐拉了半天铃没有结果，便慌慌张张地奔下去，告诉西卜女人说许模克不肯开门。这一节给弗莱齐埃在旁听了去，他料到许模克不久就得为难：这德国人从来没看见死过人，而在巴黎有个死人在手里，没有人帮忙，没有人代办丧事，其窘是可想而知的。弗莱齐埃也知道，真正悲伤的亲属，临时会一点主意都没有的。他从吃过饭以后就待在门房里跟波冷医生商量个不停，这时他决定亲自来指挥许模克的行动了。

波冷医生和弗莱齐埃能做到这一步，原因是这样的：

圣·法朗梭阿教堂的执事，从前是做玻璃生意的，叫作刚蒂南，住在奥莱昂街，跟波冷医生的屋子只有一墙之隔。刚蒂南太太在教堂里专管出租椅子，平日由波冷医生义务治病，为了感激的缘故对他很亲热，常常把自己的苦处讲给他听。两个榛子钳，逢着星期日与节日，总到圣·法朗梭阿教堂去望弥撒，跟执事、门丁、分发圣水的人都相当熟；这些人在巴黎被称为教会的小职员，往往从善男信女手里得到一些酒钱。所以刚蒂南太太和许模克也彼此很熟悉。弗莱齐埃能利用这太太做盲目的工具，是因为她有两块心病。刚蒂南的儿子，本有希望当教堂的门丁，可是他对戏剧着了迷，不愿意吃教会饭，进了奥林匹克马戏班当跑龙套，过着胡天胡地的生活，伤透了母亲的心，又把她的钱袋常常刮得精光。至于刚蒂南本人，又懒又爱喝酒，他为了这两个缺点把本行的买卖丢了。当了教堂的执事，糊涂虫非但不知悔改，反而觉得这职司更可以满足他的嗜好：他游手好闲，跟喜事车上的马夫、殡仪馆的员役和教士平日救济的穷光蛋混在一块儿喝酒，从中午起就满脸通红。

刚蒂南太太，据她自己说，当初还有一万二千法郎陪嫁，想不到老来没有好日子过。波冷医生听过上百遍的这些苦经，使他想起利用她把梭伐太太引进邦斯和许模克家里去当厨娘兼打杂。因为凭空把梭伐太太安插进去是绝对办不到的，两个榛子钳已经疑心到极点，刚才雷蒙诺克小姐没法进门，就足以使弗莱齐埃明白这一点。可是医生和律师都相信，只要是杜泼朗蒂神父介绍去的人，两个老音乐家准会闭着眼睛接受的。根据他们的计划，刚蒂南太太应当带着梭伐太太一块儿去；而弗莱齐埃的老妈子一进了门，就等于弗莱齐埃亲自到场了。





六十四、梭伐女人再度出现


杜泼朗蒂神父走到大门口，被西卜的一大群朋友挡着去路，他们都来向本区资格最老最受尊敬的门房表示关切。

波冷医生招呼了神父，把他拉过一边，说道：

“我要去看看可怜的邦斯先生；他还能有一线希望，只要他愿意让人开刀拿出肝里的结石；现在用手摸也摸得出了，使肝脏发炎而致命的就是这个；也许现在动手还来得及。他是相信你的，你应当劝他做手术；倘若开刀的时候没有意外，我可以担保他的性命。”

“我把圣体匣送回了教堂马上就来；许模克先生的情形，也需要有点宗教的帮助。”神父回答。

“我刚才知道他没人帮忙了，”波冷又道，“今儿早上，德国人跟西卜太太抢白了几句，他们是十年的老宾主，吵架想必是暂时的。可是在这个情形之下，他身边没有人怎么行呢？我们关切他也算做了件好事。”医生说着，招呼教堂的执事，“喂，刚蒂南，你去问问你女人，可愿意来看护邦斯先生，代西卜太太把许模克先生招呼几天？……就是他们不吵架，现在西卜太太也得找个替工了。”他又回头对神父说：“刚蒂南太太人倒是挺老实的。”

“你挑的人不能再好了，”忠厚的教士回答，“我们董事会也相信她，教她在教堂里收椅子的租钱。”

过了一会，波冷医生在邦斯床前看他的临终苦难一步步地加紧。许模克劝他开刀，毫无结果。老音乐家对德国人的苦苦哀求只是摇头，有时还表示不耐烦。临了，他迸足气力对许模克好不凄惨地瞪了一眼，说道：

“别闹，让我安安静静地死吧！”

许模克难过得要死过去了，但他还拿着邦斯的手轻轻亲吻，用两手把它捧着，还想把自己的生命灌注给他。这时波冷听见打铃，便去开门把杜泼朗蒂神父接了进来。

波冷医生说：“病人已经在作最后的挣扎，不过是几个钟点的事了。你今晚得派个教士来守灵。我们要赶紧教刚蒂南太太带一个打杂的老妈子来帮许模克的忙。他一点主意都没有，我还担心他会神经错乱呢；再说，屋子里还有值钱的东西，也得可靠的人看守。”

杜泼朗蒂神父是个正人君子，不知道什么叫作怀疑，什么叫作恶意，听了波冷这番入情入理的话觉得很对；而且他素来相信本区医生的为人，便站在病人房门口叫许模克过来。许模克不敢马上离开邦斯，因为邦斯的手一边抽搐一边抓着他的手，好像已经掉入深渊而唯恐再往下滚。可是临死的人照例有种幻觉，使他们碰到一样抓住一样，像火烧的时候抢救贵重的东西；因此邦斯放掉了许模克，揪着被单拼命把身子裹紧，那股情急与割舍不得的模样非常可怕。

德国人终于走过来了，教士对他说：“你朋友一死，你一个人怎么办？西卜太太又走了……”

“她是个畜生，害了邦斯的命！”

“可是你身边总得有个人，”波冷医生接口道，“今晚上就得要人守尸。”

“我来陪他，我替他祈祷！”天真的德国人回答。

“还得吃饭呢！……现在谁管你的伙食？”医生又道。

“我伤心得不想吃了！……”

“还得带着证人上区公所报告死亡；还得替死人脱掉衣服，把他缝在尸衣里；还得上丧礼代办所去订车马；还得弄饭给守尸的人，给守灵的教士吃。这些事你一个人办得了吗？……在文明世界的京城里，死个人总不能像死条狗似的！”

许模克骇得睁大了眼睛，好似变了呆子。

“邦斯不会死的！……我会把他救过来！……”

“那你也不能老不睡觉地守着他，谁跟你换班呢？邦斯要人招呼，要喝水，要吃药……”

“啊！不错！……”德国人说。

“所以，”杜泼朗蒂神父接口道，“我想叫刚蒂南太太来帮你，她这个人是挺好挺老实的……”

朋友死后的种种俗事把许模克吓坏了，恨不得跟邦斯一同死。

“唉，真是个孩子！”波冷对神父叹道。

“孩子！……”许模克莫名其妙地接了一句。

“得啦！”神父说，“我去跟刚蒂南太太说一说，要她就来。”

“你别劳驾了，”医生回答，“她是我的邻居，我现在就回去。”

死神好比一个看不见的凶手，快死的人跟他在搏斗；在临终苦难的时间，一个人受到最后几下打击，还想还手，还想挣扎。邦斯便是到了这一步，他在呻吟中叫了几声，三个人立刻从房门口奔到床前。死神又最后打了一下，把人的生机，把灵和肉的联系都斩断了：邦斯忽然静下来，那是经过临终苦难以后应有的现象；他停止了挣扎，完全清醒了，脸上显出死后的那种恬静，差不多挂着点笑容，望着周围的人。

“唉！医生，我多痛苦；可是你说得不错，现在好一些了……神父，谢谢你；我刚才在想许模克到哪儿去了……”

“许模克从昨天晚上起没吃过东西，现在已经下午四点了！你身边一个帮忙的人都没有，我们又不敢把西卜太太叫回来……”

“她什么事都做得出的，”邦斯一听西卜女人的名字，就表示深恶痛绝，“不错，为许模克是要一个诚实可靠的人才行。”

“神父跟我，”波冷说，“想到了你们两位……”

“哦！谢谢，我自己就没想到。”

“他想找刚蒂南太太来这儿帮忙……”

“哦！是那个管出租椅子的！”邦斯叫道，“不错，她是个好人。”

“她不喜欢西卜太太，”医生又补充着说，“她会把许模克先生招呼得挺好的……”

“神父，教他们夫妇俩一齐来吧，那我放心了，不会有人偷东西了……”

许模克抓着邦斯的手很高兴地捧着，以为朋友的病好起来了。

“咱们走吧，神父，”医生说，“得马上去找刚蒂南太太；我看得出的，她来的时候邦斯先生大概已经完了。”





六十五、他这样地死了


杜泼朗蒂神父在这儿劝邦斯雇刚蒂南太太做看护，弗莱齐埃却把她叫到自己家里，拿出他那套败坏人心的话和恶讼师的手段打动她，那是谁也不容易抵抗的。刚蒂南太太大牙齿，白嘴唇，脸黄肌瘦，像多数下等阶级的妇女，给苦难磨得愣头磕脑的，看到一点儿小小的好处就认为是天大的运气，听了弗莱齐埃的话就同意把梭伐太太带到邦斯家里打杂。弗莱齐埃对自己的老妈子早已吩咐停当。她答应用铜墙铁壁把两个音乐家包围起来，像蜘蛛看着黏在网上的苍蝇一样看着他们。梭伐太太的酬报是到手一个烟草零售店的牌照；这样，弗莱齐埃一方面把这个所谓的老奶妈打发走了，一方面有她在刚蒂南太太身边就等于有了个密探，有了个警察。两位朋友家里有一间下人的卧室和一间小小的厨房，梭伐女人在那儿可以搭张帆布床，替许模克做饭。波冷医生把两个妇女送上门的时候，邦斯刚好断气，而许模克还没有发觉。他拿着朋友正在逐渐冷去的手，向刚蒂南太太示意教她别开口。可是一见梭伐太太那副大兵式的模样，他不由得吓了一跳，那种反应在她这个十足男性的女人是看惯了的。

“这位太太是杜泼朗蒂神父负责介绍的，”刚蒂南太太说，“她在一个主教那儿当过厨娘，人非常靠得住，到这儿来替你做饭。”

“哦！你说话不用低声啦！”那雄赳赳的患着气喘病的梭伐女人说，“可怜的先生已经死啦！……他才断气。”

许模克尖厉地叫了一声，觉得邦斯冰冷的手在那里发硬了，他定着眼睛瞪着邦斯，死人眼睛的模样使他差不多要发疯。梭伐太太大概对这种情形见得多了，她拿着面镜子走到床前，往死人嘴边一放，看到镜子上没有一点呼吸的水汽，便赶紧把许模克的手跟死人的手拉开。

“快放手呀，先生，你要拿不出了；你不知道骨头会硬起来吗？死人一下子就冷的。要不趁他还有点暖气的时候安顿好，等会就得扯断他的骨头了……”

想不到音乐家死后倒是由这个可怕的女人替他阖上眼睛。她拿出十年看护的老经验，把邦斯的衣服脱了，身子放平了，把他两手贴在身旁，拉起被单盖住他鼻子：她的动作完全跟铺子里的伙计打包一样。

“现在要条被单把他裹起来，被单在哪儿呢？……”她问许模克，许模克觉得她的行动可怕极了。

他先看到宗教对一个有资格永生天国的人那么尊敬，此刻看到朋友给人当作货物一般包扎，心中的哀痛简直要使他失掉理性。

“随你怎么办吧！……”许模克迷迷糊糊地回答。

这老实人还是生平第一遭看见一个人死，而这个人是邦斯，是他唯一的朋友，唯一了解他而爱他的人！……

“让我去问西卜太太。”梭伐女人说。

“还得一张帆布床给这位太太睡觉。”刚蒂南太太对许模克说。

许模克摇摇头，眼泪簌落落地哭了。刚蒂南太太只得丢下这个可怜虫。可是过了一小时她又来了：

“先生，可有钱给我们去买东西？”

许模克对刚蒂南太太望了一眼，那眼风教你即使对他有一肚子的怨恨也发作不起来；他指着死人那张惨白、干瘪、尖瘦的脸，仿佛这就答复了所有的问题。

“把所有东西都拿去吧，我要哭，我要祈祷！”他说着跪了下来。

梭伐太太向弗莱齐埃去报告邦斯的死讯，弗莱齐埃立刻雇辆车上庭长太太家，要他们明天给他委托书，指定他做继承人的代表。

一小时以后，刚蒂南太太又来对许模克说：“我去找过西卜太太了，她替你们管家，应当知道东西放在哪儿；可是西卜刚死，她对我好不客气……先生，你听我说呀！……”

许模克望着这女人，她可一点不觉得自己的残酷，因为平民对于精神上最剧烈的痛苦一向是逆来顺受的。

“先生，我们要被单做尸衣，要钱买帆布床给这位太太睡，买厨房用的东西，买盘子、碟子、杯子；等会有个教士来守夜，厨房里可一样东西都没有。”

“先生，”梭伐女人接口说，“我要柴，要煤，预备夜饭，家里又什么都看不见！这也难怪，原来都是西卜女人包办的……”

许模克蜷伏在床脚下，完全没有了知觉。刚蒂南太太指着他说：

“哎，好太太，你还不信呢，他就是这样地不理不答。”

“好吧，我来告诉你碰到这种情形该怎么办。”

梭伐女人把屋子四下里扫了一眼，好比做贼的想找出人家放钱的地方。她奔向邦斯的柜子，打开抽屉，看到一只钱袋，里边有许模克卖了画用剩下来的钱；她拿到许模克面前，他糊里糊涂地点了点头。

梭伐女人就对刚蒂南太太说：“喂，嫂子，钱有了！让我数一数，拿点儿去买应用的东西，买酒，买菜，买蜡烛，样样都要，他们什么都没有呢……你在柜子里找条被单，把尸体缝起来。人家告诉我这好好先生非常老实，想不到他老实得不像话。简直是个初生的娃娃，连吃东西还要人喂呢……”

两个女人忙着做事，许模克瞧着她们的眼风完全像个疯子。他悲痛之极，入于麻痹状态，跟木头人一样眼睛老盯着邦斯的脸，仿佛给它迷住了；而长眠之后的邦斯，遗容变得非常恬静。许模克只希望死，对什么都满不在乎。便是屋子着了火，他也不会动的了。

“总共是一千二百五十六法郎……”梭伐女人对他说。

许模克耸了耸肩膀。等到梭伐女人想把邦斯缝入尸衣，来量他的身长预备裁剪被单的时候，她和可怜的德国人扭作了一团。许模克好比一条狗守着主人的尸体，谁都不让走近。梭伐女人不耐烦了，抓着德国人，像大力士般把他按在沙发里。

“快点儿，嫂子，把死人缝起来。”她吩咐刚蒂南太太。

事情一完，梭伐女人把许模克拖到床前他的老位置上，说道：“明白没有？死人总得打发掉啊！”

许模克哭了，两个女人丢下他，支配厨房去了。不消一刻，她们把生活的必需品一齐给捎了回来。





六十六、看护女人趁火打劫


开了三百六十法郎的第一笔账之后，梭伐女人开始预备一顿四个人吃的夜饭。多么丰盛的夜饭！正菜有肥鹅，有果酱炒蛋，还有生菜，还有最后那个什锦砂锅，作料之多，把肉汤变成了肉冻。晚上九点，本堂神父派来守灵的教士到了，同来的还有刚蒂南，带着四支大蜡烛和教堂里的烛台。教士发觉许模克睡在死人床上，紧紧地抱着邦斯。直要人家拿出教会的威严，他才放开尸身，跪在地上祷告。他求上帝来一个奇迹，使他能够跟邦斯相会，葬在一个墓穴内。教士舒舒服服地埋在沙发里念他的祷文。这时刚蒂南太太又上修院大街替梭伐女人买了一张帆布床和全套被褥。她们想法把一千二百五十六法郎的钱袋尽量搜刮。十一点，刚蒂南太太来问许模克可要吃点东西。他做了个手势教人别打搅他。

于是她转身招呼教士：“巴德罗先生，夜饭预备好啦！”

许模克看见人都走了，便露出点笑容，好比一个疯子觉得可以为所欲为，实现像孕妇那样急切的愿望了。他又上床紧紧抱着邦斯。半夜，教士回进屋子，许模克受了埋怨，只得放开邦斯，重新做他的祷告。天一亮，教士走了。七点钟，波冷医生很亲热地来看许模克，想逼他吃东西；可是他拒绝了。

医生说：“现在要不吃，你回来就得肚子饿；因为你得带着证人上区公所报告死亡，领一张死亡证书……”

“要我去吗？”德国人骇然地问。

“不是你是谁？……这责任你逃不了的，因为看着邦斯死的只有你一个人……”

“我没有时间……”许模克向波冷带着哀求的口吻。

“你可以雇辆车，”假仁假义的医生挺和气地回答，“我已经代表公家验过死亡。你找个邻居陪你去吧。你不在的时候，这两位太太会替你看屋子的。”

法律要跟一个伤心的人找多少麻烦，真是想象不到的。那简直要教人恨文明而觉得野蛮人的风俗可爱了。到九点，梭伐太太扶着许模克下楼，他上了马车，不得不临时请雷蒙诺克陪他上区公所，去证明邦斯的死。法国人醉心平等，可是在巴黎，每样事情都显出不平等。哪怕死个人，也有这个永远消灭不了的分别。在有钱的人家，一个亲戚，一个朋友，或是经纪人，就能替悲伤的家属把这些不愉快的小事给担任了；但报告死亡等等的手续正如分派捐税一样，所有的重担都压在没人帮忙的平民与穷人身上。

雷蒙诺克听见可怜的受难者长叹了一声，便说：“啊！你可惜他真是应该的，他人多好，多正派，留下多美的收藏；可是先生，你是外国人，你可知道马上要惹是招非了吗？因为人家到处说着，你是邦斯先生的继承人。”

许模克根本没有听；他的悲伤差不多使他变了呆子，精神像肉体一样也会害“强直病”的。

“你最好还是请个顾问，找个经纪人做代表。”

“经纪人！”许模克莫名其妙地答应了一句。

“慢慢你会觉得，你不能不有个代表。我要是你，我就找个有经验的，在街坊上有名气的，可以信托的人……我平常办些小事都托执达吏泰勃罗……只要写份委托书交给他的书记，就什么都不用操心啦。”

这番暗示，原是弗莱齐埃出了主意，由西卜女人和雷蒙诺克讲妥的，从此就深深地印在许模克的脑子里。凡是因痛苦而精神停止活动的时候，一个人的记忆会接受一切无意中得来的印象。雷蒙诺克看见许模克听着他的话，眼神像白痴一般，也就不说下去了。

他心里想：“他要老是这样呆头呆脑，我可以花十万法郎把楼上那些东西统统买下来，只要是他承继——先生，区公所到了。”

雷蒙诺克不得不搀许模克下车，扶着他走到民政科，许模克一闯闯到登记结婚的一堆里。像巴黎常有的那种巧事，登记员手头有五六份死亡证书要办，许模克只能等着，那时他的受罪仿佛上了十字架的基督。

“这位是许模克先生吗？”一个穿黑衣服的人过来招呼德国人。他听见有人叫他的名字，愣了一愣，呆子似的望着来人，像他刚才望着雷蒙诺克一样。

“你找他干吗？”旧货商问陌生人，“别打搅他，你没看见他伤心得很吗？”

“我知道先生才死了个好朋友，”陌生人说，“他是继承人，一定想给朋友留点儿纪念吧。我看先生决不爱惜小钱，会买一块永久的墓地的。邦斯先生多爱艺术！他墓地上要没有三座美丽的全身神像，代表音乐、绘画、雕塑追悼他，不是太可惜了吗？……”

雷蒙诺克拿出奥弗涅人的功架，做了个手势想教那人走开；可是那人也回敬他一个生意人的手势，意思是说：“生意也得大家做！”旧货商马上明白了。

“鄙人是索南公司的伙计，”那跑街接着说，照沃尔特·司各特的笔法，他可以被称为墓园掮客[1]，“敝公司的业务是专办墓地纪念像，倘若先生向敝公司订货，我们可以向市政府代买墓地，安葬这位朋友，他的故世的确是艺术界的损失……”

雷蒙诺克摇头摆脑表示赞成，又用肘子碰了一下许模克。

跑街看见奥弗涅人好似在鼓励他，便往下说：“每天都有人委托敝公司代办一切手续。办丧事的时候，继承人往往哀伤过度，照顾不到这些小事，我们可是代客服务惯的。先生，我们的纪念像按高度计算，材料有石灰石的，有大理石的……我们也承包全家合葬的坟墓工程，大小事务都可代办，取费公道。哀斯丹·高勃萨克小姐和吕西安·特·鲁邦泼莱的纪念雕刻，就是敝公司承办的，那是拉雪兹公墓上最美的装饰。敝公司的工匠都是好手，你先生千万别上小公司的当……他们的货色都偷工减料。”他这么补上一句，因为又有个穿黑衣服的人走近前来，预备替另一家大理石铺子招揽生意。

注解：

[1]　按沃尔特·司各特有部小说叫作Old Mortality，是个专雕墓地纪念像的人的诨名。





六十七、只有死人不受骚扰


人家常常说死是一个人的旅行到了终点，这譬喻在巴黎是再贴切也没有了。一个死人，尤其是一个有身份的死人，到了冥土仿佛游客到了码头，给所有的旅馆招待员闹得头昏脑涨。除了几个哲学家之外，除了家道富裕，又有住宅又有生圹的某些家庭之外，没有人会想到死和死的社会影响。在无论什么情形之下，死总是来得太早；并且由于感情关系，继承人从来不想到亲属是可能死的。所以，多半死了父亲、母亲、妻子、儿女的人，会立刻给那些兜生意的跑街包围，利用他们的悲痛与慌乱做成一些交易。早年间，承办墓地纪念工程的商人，都把铺子开在有名的拉雪兹公墓四周——他们集中的那条街可以叫作墓园街——以便在公墓左近或出口的地方包围丧家；可是同业竞争与投机心理，使他们不知不觉地扩充地盘，现在甚至进了城，散布到各区的区公所附近了，那般跑街往往还拿着坟墓的图样，闯进丧家的屋子。

“我正在跟先生谈生意呢。”索南公司的跑街对另一个走近前来的跑街说。

“喂，邦斯的丧家！……证人在哪儿？……”办公室的当差嚷道。

“来吧，先生。”跑街招呼雷蒙诺克。

许模克在凳上好似一块石头种在那里，雷蒙诺克只能请跑街帮着拉他起来，挟着他站在栏杆前面；办死亡证的职员跟大众的痛苦就隔着这道栏杆。许模克的救命星君雷蒙诺克，靠了波冷医生帮忙，代他把邦斯的年岁籍贯报了出来。德国人除了邦斯是他的朋友之外一无所知。大家签过了字，雷蒙诺克、医生、跑街把可怜的德国人挟上马车；那死不放松的伙计非要做成他的交易，也跟着挤上去。早等在大门口的梭伐女人，由雷蒙诺克和索南公司伙计帮着，把差不多晕倒了的许模克抱上楼。

“他要闹病了！……”跑街说。他还想把自以为开了场的买卖谈出个结果来。

“可不是！”梭伐女人回答，“他哭了一天一晚，一口东西都不肯吃。悲伤对身体是最坏的。”

跑街也跟着说：“亲爱的主顾，喝一碗汤吧。你还得办多少事呢：你得上市政府去买块地，安放你那位爱艺术的朋友的纪念像，你不是想表示你的感激吗？”

“不吃东西真是太胡闹了！”刚蒂南太太说着，手里拿了一盘肉汤一块面包。

雷蒙诺克插嘴道：“亲爱的先生，你这样累，就得找个代表，事情很多呢：你得去订送葬的仪仗，你朋友的丧事总不成给办得像穷人一样吧！”

“得了，得了，好先生！”梭伐女人看见许模克把脑袋倒在椅背上，乘机凑上来。

她拿一羹匙的汤送进许模克的嘴，像对付孩子一样硬逼他吃了些东西。

“现在，先生，你要是懂事的话，既然你想安安静静地躲在一边伤心，就得找个人来做你的代表……”

“既然先生有意替他朋友立一座美丽的纪念像，”跑街说，“不妨就托我代办一切，我可以……”

“什么？什么？”梭伐女人说，“先生向你订什么东西！你是谁？”

“我是索南公司的伙计，好太太，敝公司是承包墓地纪念像最大的号子……”他说着掏出一张名片递给魁伟的梭伐女人。

“好，好！……我们需要的时候会去找你们的；可是不能看他这副模样就欺侮他。你明明知道他现在头脑不清……”

索南公司的跑街把梭伐女人拉到楼梯台上，凑着她耳朵说：“要是你能设法让我们做成一笔交易，我可以代表公司送你四十法郎……”

“行，那么把你地址留下来。”梭伐女人变得客气了。

许模克看见人全走开了，肚子里有了汤和面包，觉得精神恢复了些，马上回到邦斯屋里去祈祷。他正陷在痛苦的深渊中昏昏沉沉的时候，忽然一个穿黑衣服的年轻人把他惊醒了。他已经“先生！先生！”地叫到第十一次，又抓着他的衣袖拼命地摇，才使可怜的受难者听到了声音。

“又是什么事啦？……”

“先生，迦那医生有个了不得的发明，把埃及人保护尸身不烂的奇迹给恢复了；敝公司决不否认迦那医生的伟大，可是我们的方法更进步，成绩更好。要是你想看到你的朋友，像他活着一样……”

“看到他？……他能跟我说话吗？”许模克嚷着。

“那不一定！……他就是不能说话；可是肉身是永远不坏的。手术只要一忽儿工夫。把颈动脉切开，来一个注射就行啦；可是得赶紧了……再过十五分钟，就赶不及替你朋友办这种称心如意的事啦……”

“去你的吧！……邦斯是有灵魂的！……这颗灵魂是在天上。”

这位青年跑街所代表的公司是跟有名的迦那医生竞争的，他走到大门口，说了句：“那家伙一点良心都没有，竟不肯替他的朋友做防腐手术！”

“人就是这样的，先生！他是继承人，得遗产的！目的达到了，哪还想到死人！”西卜女人这样说，因为她才替心爱的丈夫做过了防腐手术。





六十八、巴黎的丧事是这样办的


一小时以后，许模克看见梭伐女人走进屋子，后边跟了一个穿着黑衣服，像工人模样的年轻人，她说：“先生，刚蒂南叫教区里的棺材店老板来啦。”

棺材店老板行了礼，装着同情和安慰的神气，也有点人家少不了他和生意一定成功的派头；他挺内行地瞧着死人。

“先生要怎样的寿器呢？松板的？普通橡木的？还是铅皮里子橡木面的？最上等的当然是铅皮里子的橡木寿器。他是中等尺寸……”

老板说着，摸了摸脚，量了一下死人的身长，又补上一句：“一米七！——大概先生还要向教堂里定一场法事吧？”

许模克望着那个人，眼睛像疯子要动武的神气。

“先生，你该找个人替你办这些琐琐碎碎的事。”梭伐女人说。

“是的……”可怜虫终于答应了一声。

“要不要我去把泰勃罗先生找来？你事情还多呢。你知道，泰勃罗先生是街坊上最可靠的人。”

“哦，泰勃罗先生！有人跟我提过的……”许模克给制服了。

“那么，先生，你可以清静啦，跟你的代表商量过后，你尽管在这儿伤心吧。”

下午两点，泰勃罗手下的书记，预备将来当执达吏的青年，叫作维勒摩的，文文雅雅地进来了。青春有这一点便宜，就是不会教人害怕。维勒摩坐在许模克旁边，等机会开口。这个小心翼翼的态度使许模克很感动。

“先生，”他开始说，“我是泰勃罗先生的书记，他派我来照顾先生的利益，代办令友的葬事……你是不是有这个意思？”

“你照顾我，可救不了我的命，我是活不久的了，可是你能不能让我清静呢？”

“哦！你不用再操一点心。”

“好！那么要我怎么办呢？”

“只要在这张纸上签个字，委托泰勃罗先生做你的代表，包括一切承继遗产的事。”

“行！把纸拿来。”德国人想马上签字了。

“别忙，我先得把委托书念给你听。”

“那么念吧！”

许模克一个字都没听进去就签了字。年轻人把出殡的仪仗、教堂的法事、墓地的购买等等，都问过了许模克；许模克表示要在邦斯的坟上留一个墓穴给自己用。维勒摩告诉他，以后再没有人来打搅他或向他要钱了。

“只要能清静，我把我所有的东西送人都愿意。”可怜的人说着，又去跪在朋友的尸身前面。

弗莱齐埃得胜了，继承人给梭伐女人和维勒摩包围之下，再不能有什么自由行动。

睡眠打不倒的痛苦是没有的，所以那天傍晚，梭伐女人发现许模克躺在邦斯床前的地板上睡着了。她把他抱起，放在床上，像母亲般安顿他睡好了，他就一觉睡到第二天早上。赶到他醒来，就是说休息过后又恢复了痛苦的知觉的时候，邦斯的遗体已经给放在大门内的走道里，灵柩上的披挂等等全是三等丧仪的排场。许模克在家里再也找不到朋友，只觉得屋子格外的大，到处都是凄凉的回忆。梭伐女人像奶妈对付小娃娃似的调度德国人，逼他上教堂之前吃了饭。可怜虫一边勉强吃着东西，一边听梭伐女人絮絮叨叨，仿佛唱着奚莱弥的悼歌，说他连一套黑衣服都没有。许模克的衣着一向是西卜包办的，在邦斯病倒以前，已经和他的伙食一样被减缩到最低限度，统共只剩两条长裤和两件外套了！……

“难道你就像现在这样去送葬吗？这种荒唐事儿不给街坊上的人耻笑吗？……”

“那你又要我怎样去呢？”

“穿着孝服去呀！……”

“孝服！……”

“那是规矩呀……”

“规矩！……我才不理会这些无聊事呢！”许模克儿童般的心灵，受着痛苦的刺激，气极了。

“嘿！这样忘恩负义，简直不是人。”梭伐女人说着转过身去，因为屋子里忽然又来了一个人，许模克一见就抽了口冷气。

来人穿着漂亮的黑衣服、黑短裤、黑丝袜、白袖套，银链条上挂着一个徽章，整整齐齐地戴着白纱领带、白手套；这种俨然的人物，仿佛为了公众的丧事在同一模子里塑出来的，手里拿着他行业的标识，一根紫檀木短棍，左腋下挟着一个有三色徽记的三角帽。

“我是丧礼司仪员。”他用柔和的声音说。因为每天指挥丧礼，出入的家庭都真真假假地表示同样的悲伤，这个人和他的同业一样，说话老是小声小气的非常柔和；他的职业使他稳重，有礼，端正，好比一座代表死亡的雕像。

许模克听了他的自我介绍，不由得心惊肉跳，似乎来的是个刽子手。

“你先生跟故世的人是父子呢还是弟兄？……”这俨然的人物问。

“都是的，而且还不止……我是他的朋友！……”许模克淌着大把大把的眼泪说。

“你是继承人吗？”

“继承人？……我才不理会这些呢。”许模克又恢复了痴呆的痛苦的神气。

“亲戚朋友在哪儿呢？”

“都在这里！”许模克指着图画和古董，“它们从来不教我的邦斯伤心的！……他喜欢的就是我跟这些东西！”

许模克坐下来，呆呆地抹着眼泪，还是那副白痴的模样。这时泰勃罗的书记维勒摩出现了，司仪员认出他是接洽葬礼的人，便招呼他：

“喂，先生，该出发啦……柩车已经到了；可是这种丧事我真难得看到。亲戚朋友都在哪儿呢？……”

“我们时间很局促，”维勒摩回答，“我的当事人又悲伤成这样，什么主意都没有；可是故世的先生也只有一个亲戚……”

司仪员很同情地瞅着许模克，因为他是鉴别痛苦的专家，真情假意是一望而知的。他走到许模克身边说：

“哎，亲爱的先生，拿点儿勇气出来！……你得想到替朋友增光泉壤。”

“我们忘了报丧，可是我派了一个专差去通知玛维尔庭长，就是我说的独一无二的亲戚……此外没有什么朋友……他虽是戏院的乐队指挥，恐怕那边也不会有人来……据我知道，这位先生是指定继承人。”

“那么应当由他主持丧礼啰。”司仪员说着，注意到许模克的穿扮，便问：

“你没有黑衣服吗？”

“我心里全黑了！……”可怜的德国人声音很沉痛，“我只觉得自己快死了……上帝会哀怜我，让我跟朋友在坟墓里相会的，那我才感激他呢！……”说完了他合着手。

“敝公司已经新添了不少设备，”司仪员对维勒摩说，“可是我向经理室提过几回了，还得办一批丧服租给继承人……这个业务现在越来越需要了……既然他先生是继承人，送丧的大氅就该由他披着，我带来的这一件可以把他从头到脚地裹起来，遮掉他里边的服装……请你站起来好不好？”他对许模克说。

许模克站起身子，可是晃晃悠悠地站不稳。

“你扶着他，你不是他的全权代表吗？”司仪员招呼书记。

维勒摩用胳膊挟着许模克把他撑着，司仪员抓起又大又难看的黑大氅披在他肩上，用黑丝带在他领下扣住了，那是继承人把灵柩从家里送往教堂的时候穿的。这样，许模克就给扮作了继承人。





六十九、老鳏夫的葬礼


“现在我们可碰到了一个难题，”司仪员说，“灵柩的披挂上有四根绋……哪儿来四个执绋的人呢？……”他掏出表来瞧了瞧，“十点半了，教堂里的人已经等着了。”

“啊！弗莱齐埃来了！”维勒摩冒冒失失地叫了起来。这句话等于承认他们是串通的，可是当场没有人把它记下来。

“这位是谁？”司仪员问。

“哦！是家属方面的。”

“什么家属？”

“被剥夺承继权的家属。他是加缪索庭长的代表。”

“好极了！”司仪员的神气似乎很满意，“我们至少有两个人执绋了，你跟他。”

他因为问题解决了一半觉得挺高兴，过去拿了两副漂亮的白麂皮手套，客客气气地分送给弗莱齐埃与维勒摩：

“你们两位可愿意执绋吗？……”

弗莱齐埃穿得整整齐齐的，黑衣服，白领带，神气俨然，叫人看了直打寒噤。他仿佛把对方罪行的证据都收齐了。

“当然愿意。”他回答。

“只要再来两位，执绋的人数就齐了。”司仪员说。

这时索南公司那个死不放松的跑街又来了，后面跟着一个人，记得邦斯而特意来尽他最后礼数的唯一的人。他是戏院的小职员，在乐队里分发乐谱的当差；邦斯因为知道他要养家活口，平时每个月都给他五法郎酒钱。

“哦！多比那！……”许模克认出了当差，叫起来，“你，你还想到邦斯！……”

“先生，我每天早上都来的，来打听邦斯先生的消息……”

“每天来的！好多比那！……”许模克握着戏院当差的手。

“可是人家大概拿我当作了家属，对我很不客气！我再三声明是戏院里的，要知道邦斯先生的病情，人家可说我扯谎。我想进来看看病人，他们不准我上楼。”

“混账的西卜！……”许模克把当差那只粗糙的手按在胸口。

“邦斯先生是天底下最好的好人，每个月给我五法郎……他知道我有三个孩子一个女人。现在我女人在教堂里等着。”

“以后我跟你有饭大家吃！”许模克因为旁边有个爱邦斯的人，十分高兴。

“你先生可愿意执绋吗？”司仪员过来问，“这样，问题就解决了。”

司仪员没有费什么事，就邀上了索南公司的跑街参加执绋，尤其给他看到了一副漂亮手套，那照例是送给他的。

“十点三刻啦！非下楼不可了……教堂里的人等着呢。”司仪员说。

于是这六个人开始走下楼梯。两个妇女站在楼梯头，可恶的弗莱齐埃吩咐道：

“把屋子关严，守在里头；刚蒂南太太，倘使你想在清点遗产期间当个看屋子的，就得格外留神，嗨！嗨！四十铜子一天的工钱呢！……”

大门口停着两口柩，一口是西卜的，一口是邦斯的，因此同时有两个出殡的行列：这种巧合的事在巴黎也不足为奇。邦斯的柩罩披挂相当光鲜，可是没有一个人来对这位爱美的朋友表示敬意，倒是那看门的，有四邻八舍的门房来给他洒几滴圣水。西卜的哀荣和邦斯身后的寂寞，不但在大门口成为对照，而且在到教堂的路上也是如此。跟在邦斯柩车后面的只有许模克一个人，由司仪员搀着，因为这继承人几乎随时都要倒下来。从诺曼底街到圣·法朗梭阿教堂所在的奥莱昂街，路旁站满了看热闹的人，因为我们以前说过，这个区域里不论什么事都会轰动的。大家看到白色的柩车，柩罩上绣着一个大P字（邦斯姓氏的缩写），只有一个送殡的人；而另一辆普通的柩车，末等殡仪的车马后面，却跟着一大群吊客。幸而许模克给窗口的、路旁的、看热闹的闲人吓呆了，一句话也听不见，而且对那些拥挤的人，他的泪眼也看不大清。

“哦！是榛子钳！……”有人说，“你知道吗，就是那个音乐家！”

“那几个执绋的是谁？……”

“还不是些戏子！”

“呦！这是西卜老头的灵柩了！又少了一个认真的司务！他做活多卖力！”

“也从来不出来玩的，这家伙！”

“他一天也不歇工的。”

“而且对他女人多好！”

“呦！那可怜的寡妇来了！”

雷蒙诺克跟着他的牺牲者的柩车，听众人你一句我一句地追悼他的邻人。





七十、巴黎有多少人靠死人吃饭


两家的行列到了教堂，刚蒂南跟门丁商量好了，不让乞丐向许模克开口。维勒摩答应过不打搅德国人，所以他一边看着当事人，一边负责一切开销。西卜的简陋的柩车有七八十人陪送，直送到公墓。从教堂出来，邦斯的行列一共有四辆送殡的车：一辆是为教士他们的，其他三辆是为家属亲友预备的，但实际只需要一辆。做弥撒的时候，索南公司的跑街已经先走一步，去通知索南先生准备纪念雕刻的图样和估价单，等继承人从公墓出来拿给他看。所以弗莱齐埃、维勒摩、许模克和多比那都坐在一辆车里。多余的两辆空车并不回到丧礼代办所，照旧上拉雪兹公墓。这种把空车赶一趟的情形是常有的。凡是故世的人没有名望，不会吸引时髦人士赶来凑热闹的时候，送殡的车辆往往会太多。死者要不是生前极得人心，亲戚朋友决不肯把他送上公墓；因为巴黎人生活忙乱，都恨不得每天要有二十五小时。可是马夫要空赶一次，就没有酒钱可得；所以有人也罢，没人也罢，车子照旧上教堂，上公墓，回丧家，回到那儿，马夫就开口讨酒钱了。多少人靠死人吃饭，你简直想象不到。教堂的小职员，穷人，殡礼代办所的员役，马夫，盖坟的工人，都把柩车当作一个马槽，让自己像海绵似的吸饱。一出教堂，大批穷人上来包围许模克，马上给门丁喝阻了。但从教堂到公墓的路上，可怜的许模克很像一些囚犯给人家从法院押送到葛兰佛广场。他好比替自己送葬，只顾拿着多比那的手，因为只有他心里真正地哀悼邦斯。多比那觉得被邀执绋非常荣幸，又很高兴能坐到马车，拿到一副簇新的手套，认为给邦斯送丧的确是他生平的一件大事。许模克受着痛苦的煎熬，唯一的倚傍便是从多比那的手上感觉到一些同情，他在车中完全跟装上屠宰场的小牛一样。弗莱齐埃与维勒摩占着车厢的前座。凡是常有机会参加亲友葬礼的人，全知道大家上了送殡的车就作不了假。从教堂到巴黎东区的墓地，到这个最讲场面、最讲奢侈、壮丽的雕塑最多的公墓，路程往往很远。漠不关心的送客开始谈话，结果连最悲伤的人也伸着耳朵听着，不知不觉地精神松弛了。

“庭长先生已经出庭去了，”弗莱齐埃对维勒摩说，“我认为不必再到法院去惊动他，无论如何他赶不及来了。虽说他是血亲继承人，但邦斯先生剥夺了他的承继权，把遗产给了许模克先生，所以我想有他的代表到场也够了……”

多比那听到这话，不觉留了点神。

“还有一个执绋的家伙是谁？”弗莱齐埃问维勒摩。

“是某一家大理石铺子的跑街，想承包墓地工程，提议雕三座大理石像，由代表音乐、绘画、雕塑的三个女神来哀悼亡人。”

“主意倒不错，”弗莱齐埃回答，“那好人也值得这样的表扬；可是这件工事总要花到七八千法郎吧。”

“哦！是的！”

“要是许模克先生订了这件工程，那可不能用遗产支付，这样的开支会把整笔遗产消耗完的……”

“结果还得打一场官司，不过你会赢的……”

“那么，”弗莱齐埃又道，“要归他负责了！这桩事对那些包工的倒是个挺有意思的玩笑……”弗莱齐埃凑着维勒摩的耳朵，“因为，倘若遗嘱给撤销了——那我可以保险的——或是根本没有遗嘱，你想归谁付钱呢？”

维勒摩扮了个鬼脸，笑了笑。他跟律师两人以后便交头接耳，放低了声音谈话。虽然有车轮的声音和其他的打扰，戏院的当差平时在后台鉴貌辨色惯了，也能猜到这两个吃法律饭的正在设计划策，想教可怜的德国人为难，他还听见提到格里希[1]。于是这个喜剧界中正直而忠心的仆役，决意保护邦斯的朋友了。

维勒摩早已托索南公司的伙计，向市政府买妥了三米墓地，声明将来要立一座伟大的纪念雕塑。到了公墓，许模克由司仪员搀着，从看热闹的人堆里穿过去，走向邦斯的墓穴。教士在那儿做着最后的祷告，四个人拿着邦斯柩上的绳索等着。许模克看到那个四方形的土坑，顿时一阵心酸，晕了过去。

注解：

[1]　格里希为巴黎有名的监狱。





七十一、继承开始，先得封门


多比那，索南公司的跑街，和索南先生本人，大家七手八脚把德国人抬进大理石铺子；索南太太和合伙老板维德洛的太太都很热心，赶紧上来施救。多比那在铺子里等着，因为他看见弗莱齐埃正在和索南公司的伙计谈话，而他觉得弗莱齐埃满脸凶光，完全是上断头台的料子。

过了一小时，到下午两点半，可怜的德国人醒了。他以为过去两天全是梦，早晚能醒来看到邦斯好好地活在那里。人家在他脑门上放了多少湿手巾，给他嗅了多少盐和醋，终于使他睁开了眼睛。索南太太硬要许模克喝了一碗油水很足的肉汤，因为铺子里正炖着大砂锅。她说：

“伤心到这样的主顾，咱们难得看到的；可是每两年还能碰上一次……”

临了许模克说要回去了，于是索南先生对他说道：

“先生，你瞧这个图样，维德洛特意为你赶起来的，他画了一夜呢！……可是他的确有些灵感！完工之后一定很好看……”

“一定是拉雪兹公墓最美的一座！……”矮小的索南太太插嘴道，“朋友送了你全部家私，应当给他留个永久纪念！”

那张说是特意画起来的草图，当初是为有名的玛赛部长设计的；可是玛赛的寡妇把纪念工程交给了雕塑家史底曼，人家不要粗制滥造的作品，把索南的图样拒绝了。那三座人像原来代表七月革命中三天重大的日子，因为玛赛部长是那次政变的重要角色。以后，索南与维德洛把图样修改了一下，画成军队、财政与家庭三大光荣的象征，预备给查理·格雷做纪念像，结果人家又找了史底曼。十一年中间，为了迎合丧家的情形，那张图给换了不知多少题目；这一回，维德洛又复着原样，把三座像描作音乐、绘画与雕塑的女神。

“画图还不算什么，雕塑的工程才浩大呢，可是有六个月的时间也行了，”维德洛说，“先生，这儿是估价单和订货单……一共七千法郎，石工的费用在外。”

“倘若先生想做大理石的，价钱是一万二，”索南说，因为他的专业是大理石，“那么先生的大名可以跟你朋友并垂千古了……”

多比那咬着维德洛的耳朵说：“我才听到消息，遗嘱有人反对，遗产将来恐怕还得归血亲继承人；你们最好去看加缪索庭长：这可怜的好好先生会一个子儿都拿不到的……”

“你怎么老是找这种主顾来的！”维德洛太太开始埋怨跑街了。

送殡的马车早已回去，多比那只能陪着许模克走回诺曼底街。

“你别离开我呀！……”许模克说，因为多比那把他交还给梭伐女人，想走了。

“已经四点了，亲爱的许模克先生，我得回去吃饭……内人是戏院的案目，我这样老半天不回家，她要担心了。你知道，五点三刻戏院要开门的……”

“哦，我知道……可是你想，我现在孤零零的，一个朋友都没有了。你是不忘记邦斯的，你得指点指点我；我简直掉在黑夜里，邦斯还说我周围全是些坏蛋……”

“我早已看出了，刚才我已经把你救出了格里希！”

“格里希？……”许模克叫道，“我不懂……”

“哎哟，可怜的人！放心，我会来看你的，再会了。”

“再会，再会！希望你就来！……”许模克说着，已经累得半死了。

“再会，先生！”梭伐太太对多比那说话的神气很古怪。

“哦！怎么啦，老婆子？……”戏院当差冷冷地问，“你这副模样倒像舞台上的奸细。”

“你才是奸细！你到这儿来干什么？想来兴风作浪，骗先生的钱吗？……”

“什么！骗先生的钱？……”多比那功架十足地回答，“鄙人不过是个戏院的当差，可是我喜欢艺术家；告诉你，我从来不向人要求什么！我有没有向你要求什么？欠过你什么？老婆子，你说！……”

“哦！你是戏院的当差，你叫什么名字？……”梭伐女人问。

“我叫多比那！……怎么着，您哪！……”

“我就要知道你的尊姓大名。”

“怎么啦，好太太？……”刚蒂南太太冲过来问。

“嫂子，你在这儿预备晚饭，我得上先生家跑一趟……”

“他在楼下跟西卜太太说话呢——她死了丈夫把眼泪都哭干了。”刚蒂南太太回答。

梭伐太太三脚两步地滚下去，把楼梯都震动了。

“先生……”她把弗莱齐埃拉到一边。

多比那凭他在后台学的一点儿小聪明，居然使邦斯的朋友不致落入圈套，他想到这也算报答了一下恩人，不由得很高兴。他因此决心要保护这位乐队里的乐师，不让人家欺他忠厚。梭伐女人等多比那走过门房的时候，指着他对弗莱齐埃说：

“你瞧这个小浑蛋！……他自命为规矩人，想来管许模克先生的事……”

“他是谁？……”弗莱齐埃问。

“哦！是个无名小子……”

“咱们办公事的眼里，没有无名小子的……”

“他是戏院里的当差，叫作多比那……”

“好，梭伐太太！你老是这样卖力，烟草牌照是稳的了。”

弗莱齐埃说完，又跟西卜太太继续谈话：

“所以，亲爱的当事人，我说，你没有跟我们公平交易；对一个不忠实的合伙人，我们是用不着负责的！”

“嗯，我欺骗了你什么？……”西卜女人把拳头往腰里一插，“凭你这副阴森森的眼睛，冷冰冰的神气，就想吓倒我吗？……你想找碴儿，对说过的话不认账，亏你还自称为规矩人！你知道你是什么东西吗？你是一个流氓！哼，哼，你尽管搔你的胳膊吧！……别拿这种话来唬我！……”

“老妈妈，甭废话，甭生气，你听我说！你是捞饱了……今儿早上，他们准备出殡的时候，我找到了这本目录，一共有正副两份，都是邦斯先生的亲笔，我无意中看到了这一条。”

他打开那本手写的目录，念道：

“藏品第七号：精美画像一幅，底子是大理石的，塞巴斯蒂亚诺·德尔·皮翁德一五四六年作。原作存丹尔尼大寺，给人家拿出来，现在卖给了我。还有姊妹作某主教像，被一个英国人买去。我这幅是画的一个玛德派教士的祈祷，原来挂在教堂里洛西家墓的高头。倘无年月为证，此画竟可说是拉斐尔手笔。卢浮宫博物馆所藏毕氏作品，《巴岂沃·庞第奈里肖像》，偏于干枯，远不及我这一幅。因为它用石板做底子，所以色泽鲜艳，历久不变。”

“我一看第七号作品的地位，”弗莱齐埃接着说，“只有一幅夏尔登作的女像，下面也没有第七号的标签！……我在司仪员找人执绋的时候，把画数了一遍，发觉有八张画都给换上了普通的、没有号数的作品；那失踪的八张，邦斯先生在目录上注明全是最好的东西……此外还少了一幅木板底子的小画，作者叫作曼殊，也是被认为精品的……”

“我可是看守图画的人，我问你？”西卜女人说。

“你可是他亲信的老妈子，邦斯先生家里的事全是你管的，这明明是偷盗……”

“偷盗！告诉你吧，先生，那些画是邦斯先生为了要用钱，教许模克先生卖出去的。”

“卖给谁？”

“卖给埃里·玛古斯和雷蒙诺克……”

“卖了多少？……”

“我记不得了！……”

“亲爱的西卜太太，你是捞饱了！……我会看着你，你逃不了的……你要对我识相一点，我就不声张！总而言之，你该明白，既然揩了加缪索庭长的油，就不能再希望从他那儿得到什么。”

“亲爱的弗莱齐埃先生，我早知道我要落空的……”西卜女人听了“我不声张”这句话，态度缓和了些。





七十二、干预人家的官司是危险的


“嗯，”雷蒙诺克闯进来说，“你来跟西卜太太找碴儿；那可不成话！卖画是邦斯先生跟我跟玛古斯先生大家情愿的；你知道，他还为了画做乱梦呢，我们费了三天口舌才和他商量停当。我们拿到正式的发票，要是我们送西卜太太四十法郎，那也没有什么大不了，她到手的不过是我们到人家屋里买东西照例给的佣钱。啊！亲爱的先生，你要以为一个寡妇是好欺侮的，那可打错算盘了！……明白没有，你这位搬弄是非的人？这件事全在玛古斯先生手里，你要不跟太太客气一些，想赖掉你说过的话，我一定在拍卖的时候等着你，嗬！我跟玛古斯两个把画商鼓动起来，斗你一斗，看你损失多少！……什么七十万八十万的，你甭想啦，连二十万还卖不到！”

“好，好，咱们瞧吧！”弗莱齐埃说，“咱们根本不卖，要卖也上伦敦去卖。”

“那还不是一样！随你巴黎伦敦，玛古斯先生的势力一样大。”

“再会，太太，我要去仔细查查你的事，”弗莱齐埃说，“除非你永远听我的指挥。”他又补上一句。

“小流氓！……”

“留点神哪，”弗莱齐埃回答，“我要当初级法庭庭长啦！”

他们这样互相恫吓着分手了，其实两人听了对方的话都有点害怕。

“谢谢你，雷蒙诺克，”西卜女人说，“一个可怜的寡妇有人保护真是太好了。”

晚上十点，高狄沙在经理室召见乐队的当差。自从他跟作家们打交道，手下有了一大批做戏的、跳舞的、跑龙套的、音乐师和管布景的技工等等给他指挥以后，他学了一副拿破仑功架，喜欢把右手插在背心里头，抓着左边的背带，斜着四分之三的脑袋，眼睛望着空中。当下他站在壁炉前面，就摆着这个姿势。

“喂！多比那，你可是发了财啦？”

“没有，先生。”

“那么你是另有高就了？”

“不，先生。”当差的脸发了白。

“该死！我派你女人在新戏上演的时候当案目……我看在前任经理的面上留着她……我让你白天擦擦后台的灯，晚上招呼乐谱。除此以外，碰到戏里有什么地狱的场面，还教你扮个魔鬼头儿，挣二十铜子外快。这样的差事，戏院里的员工谁不眼红！朋友，人家都在忌妒你呢，因为你有你的冤家。”

“我有冤家？……”多比那说。

“你还有三个孩子，大的常在这儿扮戏里的小孩子，拿五十生丁……”

“先生……”

“你听我说好不好！……”高狄沙大喝一声。“凭你这样的情形，你还想离开戏院……”

“先生……”

“你想管闲事，卷进人家的遗产官司！……嗨，糊涂蛋，人家要干掉你就像打烂一个鸡子一样容易！我的后台是部长大人包比诺伯爵阁下，他呀，一等聪明，十分能干；也算王上有眼力，又把他请进内阁去了……这位政治家，这位大人物，我是说包比诺伯爵，他替儿子娶了玛维尔庭长的女儿，玛维尔庭长是司法界最了不起最受敬重的要人，高等法院的一盏明灯。你认得高等法院吗，嗯？告诉你，他是咱们乐队指挥邦斯先生的外甥，应当继承他的遗产。你今儿早上去送邦斯的葬，我不怪你对这好人尽你最后的礼数……可是倘使去管许模克先生的闲事，你就越出范围了；我对那老实人也很好，可是他不久就得跟邦斯的继承人闹纠纷……因为德国人跟我没有什么相干，而包比诺伯爵对我关系很大，所以我劝你让许模克自个儿去想办法。德国人另外有个上帝照顾，你想替天行道是要倒霉的！明白没有？还是安分守己，做你的戏院当差吧……这是最聪明的办法！”

“我明白了，经理先生，”多比那说着，心里很难过。

这样，许模克就失掉了无意中碰上的保护人；他还以为明天能见到当差，那唯一哀悼邦斯的人呢。第二天一早醒来，德国人看到屋子空荡荡的，更感觉朋友的死对他损失重大。昨天和前天，因为忙着丧葬等等，周围乱哄哄的，他眼前还有些分心的事。可是一个朋友，一个父亲，一个儿子，一个心爱的妻子进了坟墓以后，屋子里那种阴惨的冷静简直可怕，好像要教你冻成冰似的。可怜虫觉得有股不由自主的力量把他推进邦斯的屋子，但他看了一眼就受不住，赶紧退出来坐在饭厅里。梭伐女人开出早饭来，许模克可一点吃不下。





七十三、三个穿黑衣服的人


忽然门铃一响，来势相当猛烈；刚蒂南太太和梭伐太太让三个穿黑衣服的人走了进来。为首的是初级法庭庭长维丹和他的书记官。第三个是弗莱齐埃，沉着脸，气色更难看了，因为他知道另有一份正式的遗嘱，把他那么大胆地偷来而当作法宝的一份给撤销了，不禁大失所望。

“先生，”庭长声音很柔和地对许模克说，“我们来封存财产……”

许模克好似听到了外国话，吓得呆呆地瞧着三个人。

书记官接口道：“我们是根据弗莱齐埃律师的申请而来的，他代表邦斯先生的外甥兼继承人，加缪索·特·玛维尔先生……”

“收藏就在这大客厅和故世的人的卧房里。”弗莱齐埃说。

“好，咱们就上那儿去。——对不起，先生，请吧，你尽管用饭。”初级法庭庭长说。

三个黑衣人物的光临把可怜的德国人吓得凉了半截。

“先生，”弗莱齐埃瞪着许模克，那副恶狠狠的眼神大有先声夺人的威势，好似蜘蛛能慑服苍蝇一样，“先生，你既有本领拿到一张公证遗嘱，就应当预备家属方面来反对。家属决不会毫无抵抗，让外人抢掉家私的；咱们瞧吧，究竟是卑鄙龌龊的方面得胜，还是家属得胜！……我们以继承人的资格，有权要求封存遗产，我们一定办到这一点，而且要把手续做得非常周到。”

“上帝！上帝！我犯了什么天条呀？”淳朴的许模克叫道。

“屋子里大家都在谈论你呢，”梭伐女人说，“你睡着的时候，有个小伙子来找你，浑身穿着黑衣服，一个油头粉脸的家伙，说是汉纳耿先生的书记。他硬要见你，可是你睡着，昨天送丧等等又把你搅累了，所以我告诉他，你已经委托泰勃罗的书记做代表，有什么事可以找他。那小伙儿就说：‘啊！那好极了，我可以跟他去商量。我们要把遗嘱送法院。’我跟着托他赶快通知维勒摩先生来。哎，好先生，你放心，有人会来保护你的，他们决不能拿你当绵羊似的随意摆布。维勒摩先生会替你尽心出力，把他们顶回去！我对那个不要脸的西卜女人已经发作了一场，一个看门的居然敢批评房客，一口咬定你抢了继承人的家私，软禁了邦斯先生，折磨他，又说他早已变了疯子。我老实不客气把她臭骂了一顿，我说：‘你是一个坏东西，你是一个贼！你偷了两位先生的东西，要不送你上公堂才怪！……’她听了哑口无言。”

“先生，”书记官招呼许模克，“请你过来好不好，我们要在邦斯先生的屋子里贴封条了！”

“请吧请吧！”许模克回答，“我要清清静静地死大概总可以吧？”

“放心，你要死是不会有人干涉的，”书记官笑道，“我们在这儿的重要公事是封存遗产。可是我难得看见指定继承人会跟着遗嘱人进坟墓的……”

“我就要跟他进坟墓！”许模克再三受到打击，痛苦得受不住了。

“哦！维勒摩先生来啦！”梭伐女人叫道。

“维勒摩先生，你来代表我呀。”可怜的德国人对他说。

“我特意赶来通知你，遗嘱完全合格，法院一定会批准，让你执管遗产的。哦！你要得一笔好大的家私了。”

“我？得一笔好大的家私？”许模克觉得给人怀疑他贪财，急坏了。

“可是，”梭伐女人插嘴道，“那法官拿着蜡烛和布条子在那儿干什么呀？”

“哦！他在贴封条……来，许模克先生，你应该到场。”

“不，你去吧……”

“干吗要贴封条呢？先生不是在自己家里，一切东西都是他的吗？”梭伐女人像所有的妇女一样，是用一厢情愿的态度看法律的。

“先生不是在自己家里，太太，他是在邦斯先生家里；当然将来一切都是他的，可是遗产受赠人要等到法院核准之后才能执管遗产。倘若被剥夺承继权的继承人反对执管，那就得打官司了……因为遗产归谁还没决定，所有的东西都得封存起来，由继承人和遗产受赠人双方的公证人，在法定期限之内把遗产清册造好……”

许模克生平第一次听到这些话，完全给搅糊涂了，脑袋倒在他坐着的椅子上，重甸甸地再也抬不起来。维勒摩去跟法官书记官谈着话，拿出办公事的态度，非常冷静地参加他们封存的手续。遇到这种情形，只要没有继承人在场，大家把每样东西贴封条的时候，总免不了七嘴八舌说些打趣的话。四个吃法律饭的人，封了客厅的门，回到饭厅里。许模克心不在焉地看他们办理手续，把盖有法院官章的布条子贴在门中间，倘使是双扇门的话，而碰到单扇门或柜子等等，就贴在门缝上面。

“咱们上这间屋去吧。”弗莱齐埃指着许模克的卧房，那是有扇门跟饭厅通连的。

“这是先生的屋子呀！”梭伐女人叫着，跑过去站在门口，挡着那些办公事的人。

“我们在文件里头找到了租约，”可恶的弗莱齐埃说，“上面不是两个人的名字，而是邦斯先生一个人的。所以整个屋子都得归入遗产……”他打开了许模克屋子的门，又道：“并且，庭长，你瞧，里边还堆满了画呢。”

“啊，不错。”庭长这句话，当场使弗莱齐埃的主张得胜了。





七十四、弗莱齐埃的成绩


“啊，诸位，等一等，”维勒摩说，“你们想把指定继承人撵出去吗？至今为止他的身份还没有人争论。”

“怎么没有？”弗莱齐埃回答，“我们反对他执管遗产。”

“凭什么理由？”

“你慢慢会知道的，小子！”弗莱齐埃冷冷地说，“我们并不反对受赠人把他自己的东西从他屋里拿走；可是屋子一定得封起来。他先生爱上哪儿住都可以。”

“不，他决不让出屋子！……”

“怎么呢？”

“我要法院来个紧急处分，当庭宣告我们是合租屋子的房客，你不能赶走我们……你们尽管把画拿出来，分清哪是邦斯先生的东西，哪是我当事人的，凡是他的就得放在他屋里……明白没有，小子？……”

“我走我走！”老音乐家说，他听着这番可厌的辩论，忽然提起了精神。

“对啦，还是这办法聪明！”弗莱齐埃说，“你可以省点儿钱；这件小事打起官司来你也赢不了的。租约是真凭实据……”

“租约租约！”维勒摩回答，“这是事实问题！……”

“哼，那像刑事案子一样不能靠人证的……你预备由法院派人调查、勘验……要求临时判决，来整套的诉讼程序吗？”

“不，不！”许模克吓得直嚷，“我搬家，我走……”

许模克过的是哲学家生活，那种朴素简陋差不多有点玩世不恭的意味。他只有两双鞋子，一双靴子，两套完全的衣服，一打衬衫，一打颈围，一打手帕，四件背心，另外还有邦斯送的一支精美的烟斗和一只绣花烟袋。他气愤之下，跑进屋子，把自己所有的东西都拣出来放在椅子上。

“这些都是我的！……还有钢琴也是我的。”他说话时那种天真淳朴，就跟古希腊的高人隐士一样。

“太太……”弗莱齐埃吩咐梭伐女人，“你找个人帮忙，把钢琴推出去，放在楼梯台上。”

“你也欺人太甚了，”维勒摩抢着对弗莱齐埃说，“发号施令有庭长在这儿，这件事只有他才能做主。”

“里头很有些值钱的东西呢。”书记官指着卧房说了一句。

“并且他先生是自愿出去的。”庭长也表示了意见。

“从来没看到这样的当事人，”维勒摩愤愤不平地，回过来对许模克生气了，“你简直是个脓包！……”

“反正一个人死在哪儿都一样！”许模克一边出门一边说，“这些人都张牙舞爪像老虎似的……那些破东西我叫人来拿就是了。”他又补上一句。

“你上哪儿去呀，先生？”

“听上帝安排！”指定继承人做了个满不在乎的手势。

“你得把住址通知我。”维勒摩嘱咐他。

“你跟着他去呀。”弗莱齐埃凑着维勒摩的耳朵说。

他们指定刚蒂南太太看守屋子，在邦斯剩下的款项内先拨了五十法郎给她。

许模克一走，弗莱齐埃就对维丹说：“事情进行得不错。你要愿意告老，把位置让给我，不妨去见见玛维尔庭长太太，你一定跟她谈得拢的。”

许模克在院子里回头对窗子望了最后一眼，法官在楼上看了对弗莱齐埃说：“你碰上了一个窝囊废！”

“不错，事情已经十拿九稳了！你不必三心二意，就把孙女儿嫁给波冷吧，他要当养老院的主任医师了。”

“慢慢再说吧！——再见，弗莱齐埃先生。”法官很亲热地和他告别。

“这家伙倒真有几招，”书记官说，“他会抖起来的，这小子！”

那时刚好十一点，德国老头心里想着邦斯，不知不觉走上了他平日和邦斯俩走惯的路；他时时刻刻看到朋友，觉得他还在自己身旁；临了他走到戏院前面，看见多比那从里头走出来。多比那一边想着经理的蛮横，一边擦着各处的灯，刚把工作做完。

“哦！办法有了！”许模克叫着把当差拦住了，“多比那，你可有地方住呀？……”

“有，先生。”

“有家吗？”

“有，先生。”

“你可愿意管我的膳宿？哦！我很能出点钱，我有九百法郎年金呢……并且我也活不久了……我决不打搅你，吃东西挺随便！唯一的嗜好是抽烟斗……跟我一起哭邦斯的只有你，所以我喜欢你。”

“先生，我还有不乐意的吗？可是先告诉你，高狄沙先生把我排揎了一顿……”

“排揎？”

“就是说骂了我一顿，因为我关切你的事……所以咱们得留点儿神，倘使你上我家去的话！可是我看你住不了的。你才不知道像我这等穷小子的家是怎么回事呢！……”

“我宁可跟一些有良心的、不忘记邦斯的穷人在一块儿，可不愿意跟人面兽心的家伙住在王宫里！我才在邦斯家看到些野兽，他们把什么都想吞下去呢！……”

“来，先生，你自己去瞧吧……我们有个阁楼……去跟我女人商量一下再说……”

许模克绵羊似的跟着多比那，由他领到一个可称为巴黎之癌的贫民窟里。那地方叫作鲍打弄，是条很窄的巷子，两旁的屋子都是地产商为了投机，盖得挺马虎的。巷子的起点，是篷地街上给圣·玛丁戏院的大厦——又是巴黎的一个疣——遮得黑魆魆的一段；弄内的路面比篷地街低，从斜坡上往玛多冷街方面低落下去，可是半中间给一条小巷子截住了，使整个鲍打弄成为T字形。这两条交叉的小巷里头，一共有六七层高的三十来幢房子。房子里的院子、住房，全做了各种工场和堆栈。这简直是小型的圣·安东阿纳城关。其中有做木器的，做铜器的，缝戏装的，做玻璃器具的，给瓷器上颜色的，总而言之，凡是制造各式巴黎货的工业，无不应有尽有。巷子跟它的商业一样肮脏一样发达，老是挤了来来往往的人、大大小小的货车，一切景象叫人看了恶心。满坑满谷的居民，正好跟周围的环境调和。他们都是些耍手艺的工匠，把所有的聪明都用在手艺上的人。因为租金便宜，人丁之旺不下于巷内出产的商品。多比那住在鲍打弄左手第二幢房子的七层楼上，从他的公寓里可以望到几个大花园，那是属于篷地街上硕果仅存的几座大宅子的。

多比那的住屋包括两个房间，一个厨房。第一间房是孩子们睡的，摆着两张白木小床和一只摇篮。第二间是多比那夫妇的卧室。厨房兼做了饭厅。从白木扶梯上去，顶上有个六英尺高而盖着锌片的假阁楼，开着一扇老虎窗。这小间既美其名曰下房，多比那的屋子也就够得上称为完全的公寓，而要花到四百法郎租金了。一进门有个小穿堂，靠厨房的圆窗取光，统共只有三间屋子的房门的地位。屋内是砖地，墙上糊的是六个铜子一卷的花纸，壁炉架的漆是模仿木头的恶俗颜色。住的五个人中间，三个是孩子，所以壁上凡是孩子的胳膊够得着的地方，全给划满了很深的沟槽。





七十五、一个不大舒服的家


有钱的人万万想不到多比那家里的厨房用具多么简单，统共只有一座灶、一口小锅、一个烤肉架、一只煮菜锅、一只平底锅和两三只白铁咖啡壶。白的和土黄的搪瓷碗盏，全套只值十二法郎。厨房桌子兼做饭桌，另有两张椅子两个圆凳。灶下有一个篓，堆着煤和木柴。壁角的木桶是洗衣服用的，而洗衣服多半还得等到夜里。孩子们的卧房内，拴着晾衣服的绳子，墙上花花绿绿粘着戏院的招贴，报上剪下来的画片，或是有插图的书籍的说明书。屋角堆着大儿子学校里的课本。晚上六点父母到戏院上班以后，就由这孩子管家。好些平民家庭中的孩子，一到六七岁就对小兄弟小姊妹代行母亲的职司。

这段简单的描写，足以表明多比那夫妇是那些俗语所谓穷而清白的人。多比那大约四十岁，老婆名叫洛洛德，也有三十岁了。她当过合唱队的领班，据说做过高狄沙前任经理的情妇，当年还是个美人儿，但前任经理的失败对她大有影响，使她不得不跟了多比那。她相信只要他们两人能挣到一百五十法郎一月，多比那一定会补办结婚手续；他多么疼他的孩子，决不肯让他们永远做私生子的。多比那太太早上空闲的时候，在家里缝制戏装，晚上在戏院当案目。这两个勇敢的小职员，花了天大的气力才挣到九百法郎一年。

“还有一层。”多比那从四楼起就对许模克这么说着；许模克伤心透了，迷迷糊糊地已分不清是在上楼还是下楼。

多比那像所有的员工一样身上套着件白围身，一开大门，就听见他太太大声嚷着：

“喂，孩子们，别嚷！爸爸来啦！”

大概孩子们对爸爸是要怎么就怎么的，所以老大照旧学着在奥林匹克马戏班看来的玩意儿，骑在扫帚柄上冲锋；老二吹着白铁笛子；老三尽量学着老大的样。母亲正在缝一套戏装。

“别闹！”多比那大吼一声，“再闹我要揍了！”——他又轻轻地对许模克说：“一定要这样吓吓他们的。”——然后他招呼老婆：“小乖乖，这位便是许模克先生，邦斯先生的朋友；他没有地方住，想搬到我们这儿来；我告诉他我们家里谈不上体面，又是在七层楼上，只能给他一个小阁楼……他还是要来……”

多比那太太端过一张椅子让许模克坐下，孩子们看到陌生人都愣住了，彼此挤在一起，不声不响地把他仔细打量，一忽儿也打量完了。儿童和狗一样，对人不是靠判断而是用鼻子闻的。许模克望着这群美丽的孩子，看到一个五岁的小女孩，长着漂亮的金黄头发，便是刚才吹喇叭的。

“她倒很像一个德国娃娃！”许模克说着，对她招招手要她过来。

“先生住到这儿来是怪不舒服的，”多比那太太说，“倘使我不需要把孩子放在身边，我可以腾出我们自己的卧房。”

她打开房门让许模克进去。这间屋是全家的精华所在：桃花木的床上挂着白镶边的蓝布床帷，窗上也挂着同样的蓝布帘。柜子，书桌，椅子，虽然全是桃花木的，倒也收拾得很干净。壁炉架上摆着一口钟和一对烛台，显见还是从前破产的经理送的，他的一幅恶劣的画像就挂在柜子高头。孩子们因为不准踏进这间屋子，这时都在伸头探颈地张望。

“先生住在这儿才好呢。”多比那太太说。

“不，不，”许模克回答，“我活不久的了，只是找个地方等死。”

关上房门，大家走上阁楼。一到那儿，许模克就叫道：“这才对啦！……我没有跟邦斯同住以前，就是住的这种地方。”

“那么，只要买张折床，两条褥子，一个长枕，一个方枕，两张椅子，一张桌子。这也没有什么大不了，连洗脸盆、水壶、床前的脚毯在内，一百五十法郎就能对付了……”

一切商量停当，只缺少一百五十法郎。许模克看到这些新朋友的艰难，当时离开戏院又只有几步路，自然想到向经理去要薪水了……他立刻上戏院，找到了高狄沙。经理拿出他对付演员们的态度，又客气又有点紧张的样子接见许模克；他听到许模克来讨一个月的薪水，不由得奇怪起来。可是一查账，果然没有错。

“嘿，朋友，你真了不起！”经理说，“德国人哪怕在悲伤的时候，也忘不了他们的账……我还以为你会谢谢我一千法郎的津贴，那等于你们一年的薪水，还该出张收据呢！”

“我们什么都没拿到，”德国人回答，“我今天来见你，是因为我给人家赶到了街上，身边一个子儿都没有……你把津贴交给谁的？”

“你们的看门女人！……”

“哦，西卜太太！”德国人叫起来，“她害了邦斯的性命，偷了他东西，把他出卖了……她还想烧掉他的遗嘱……简直是个流氓婆！是只野兽！”

“嗳，你是指定继承人，怎么会没有一个钱，没有地方住，流落在街上呢？这真叫作从何说起！”

“人家把我赶出了大门……我是外国人，一点不懂法律……”

“可怜的老头儿！”高狄沙心里想，他已经料到这场一面倒的官司是什么结果了。“你可知道你该怎么办吗？”他对许模克说。

“我有个代理人呢！”

“那么你趁早跟继承人和解，还可以从他们那儿得一笔钱和一笔终身年金，这样你就能太太平平地过日子啦……”

“我只要能太太平平地过日子！”许模克回答。

“好吧，让我替你安排。”





七十六、高狄沙的慷慨


原来弗莱齐埃上一天已经把计划跟高狄沙谈过了。高狄沙以为替庭长夫人解决了这件肮脏事，一定能讨包比诺子爵夫人母女俩的喜欢；他想立了这一功，将来至少也得当个参议官。

“我全权拜托你吧……”许模克说。

“行！第一我先给你三百法郎……”这位戏院里的拿破仑从皮包里掏出十五枚金路易递给许模克。

“这是预支你六个月的薪水；要是你离开戏院，就还我这笔钱。咱们来算一算你每年要多少开支，要怎么样才过得快活。来！来！譬如你过着阔佬的生活，你得花多少钱？……”

“我每年只要一套冬季衣服，一套夏季衣服……”

“三百法郎！”高狄沙说。

“四双鞋……”

“六十法郎。”

“袜子……”

“就算一打吧！三十六法郎。”

“六件衬衫。”

“布料子的，二十四法郎；再加六件府绸的，四十八法郎。以上一共四百六十八法郎，加上领带手帕等等，就算五百吧，加一百法郎洗衣服……六百！还有伙食，你要多少？……一天三法郎行吗？”

“哦，太多了！……”

“可是你还得买帽子呢……那就是一千五，五百房租，两千。要不要我替你要求两千法郎的终身年金？到期照付，决不拖欠。”

“还有我的烟草呢？”

“那么再加四百！哎，许模克老头，你管这个叫作烟草吗？……行，你要烟草就给你烟草。那就是两千四的年金。”

“我的账还没完呢，我还要一笔现款……”

“哦！还要佣金！对啦！这些德国人还说自己天真！瞧他这个老奸巨猾！……”高狄沙心里这么想着，问道：“你还要什么呢？先告诉你，这是最后一笔，不能再节外生枝了。”

“那是为了一笔神圣的债。”

高狄沙私下想：“债！……想不到他这么坏，比浪子还要不得！居然会造假账，拿出些借票来！得趁早拦住他。那弗莱齐埃是手面很小的！”他接着说：“什么债呀，朋友？你说吧！……”

“跟我一起追悼邦斯的只有一个人……他有个可爱的小女孩子，头发真漂亮，我刚才看见她，就像看到了我亲爱的德国！……当初我就不应该离开德国，巴黎不是我们住的地方，大家拿我们打哈哈……”他微微摆了摆脑袋，仿佛把人情世故看透了似的。

“他疯了！”高狄沙对自己说。

可是经理对这个忠厚的人也动了恻隐之心，不禁冒起一颗眼泪。

“啊！经理先生，你明白了我的意思！那小姑娘的父亲就是多比那，在乐队里当差，管点灯什么的；邦斯在的时候很喜欢他，常常照顾他；只有他一个人陪着我把邦斯送上教堂，送上公墓……我要拿三千法郎送给他，另外拿三千法郎给他女儿……”

“可怜的好人！……”高狄沙暗暗地想。

多比那送邦斯的葬，在一般人看来完全是不足道的小事，许模克却看作像波舒哀说的一杯水一样[1]，比征略者打的胜仗还重要：这点高尚的心胸使那位贪婪成性的暴发户也大为感动。因为高狄沙虽然虚荣，虽然极想不择手段地往上爬，跟他的老朋友包比诺并驾齐驱，骨子里还是有良心的。他觉得刚才把许模克看错了，便一口答应说：

“没有问题，你要的款子我都替你办到！亲爱的许模克，我还想再进一步地帮忙。多比那是个诚实可靠的人……”

“是的，我才看到他跟他清苦的家庭，他多喜欢那些孩子呵……”

“鲍特朗老头辞职了，我想叫多比那当出纳……”

“哦！上帝保佑你！”许模克嚷着。

“那么，我的好人，你今晚四点到公证人贝蒂哀家里去；我替你把一切都办妥，老年的生活你别愁了……你要的六千法郎也照给，在乐队里你帮着迦朗育，像跟邦斯一样，照旧支你的原薪……”

“唉！我怎么还活得下去！……我对什么都没心思了……我觉得自己完了……”

“可怜的绵羊！”高狄沙一边跟告退的德国人行礼，一边想，“不过，话得说回来，人总是吃荤的。歌曲大家裴朗越说得好：‘可怜的绵羊，早晚得给人剪毛！’”他哼着这两句，想排遣心里的感触。

“教他们预备车子。”他吩咐当差。

一忽儿他下楼，对马夫嚷道：“上汉诺威街！”

野心家的面目又整个儿恢复了，他眼里看到了参事院。

注解：

[1]　波舒哀为法国十七世纪有名的说教家，曾言给穷人的一杯水，在最后审判时评量善恶功过的天平上极占重要。





七十七、夺回遗产的办法


那时许模克买了花，买了点心，差不多很高兴地捧着去给多比那的孩子。

“我带点心来啦！……”他微笑着说。

这是他三个月来第一次的笑容，令人看了只觉得不寒而栗。

“可是有个条件。”他补上一句。

“先生，你太好了。”孩子们的母亲说。

“得让我抱一下这小女孩儿，还要她把花编在辫子里，像德国小姑娘一样！”

“奥尔迦，你得听先生的话，他要你怎办就怎办……”母亲沉着脸吩咐。

“别对我的德国娃娃这么凶啊！……”许模克嚷着。他在这个女孩子身上看到了他亲爱的祖国。

“你的东西我已经叫三个挑夫在那里搬来了！……”多比那从外边进来说。

“啊！朋友，”德国人招呼他，“这儿两百法郎是做开销的……你太太真好，将来你要跟她正式结婚的，是不是？我送你三千法郎……再送你女孩儿三千法郎做陪嫁，你给她存起来。你也不用再做当差，马上要升作戏院的出纳了……”

“我？接鲍特朗老头的差事？”

“是啊。”

“谁跟你说的？”

“高狄沙先生。”

“哦！那真要乐疯了！……哎！洛莎丽，戏院里的人不是要忌妒死了吗！……这简直不可能！”

“咱们的恩人怎么可以住在阁楼上？……”

“我活也活不了几天，有这么个地方住也很好了，”许模克说，“再见！我要上公墓去……看看他们把邦斯怎办了……还得给他墓上送些花去。”

加缪索庭长太太那时正焦急到极点。弗莱齐埃在她家里跟公证人贝蒂哀和诉讼代理人高特夏商量了一番。贝蒂哀和高特夏认为那份当着两位公证人和两个见证立的遗嘱，绝对推翻不了，因为汉纳耿起的稿子措辞非常明确。据正派的高特夏说，即使许模克被他现在的法律顾问蒙蔽一时，早晚也会给人点醒，因为想找机会出头而乐于帮忙的律师有的是。贝蒂哀和高特夏，不消说，早已把弗莱齐埃的底细打听清楚，所以等他在邦斯家办妥封存手续回来的时候，特意请庭长太太把他邀到庭长书房里去起草传票底稿；然后他们劝她提防弗莱齐埃。他们觉得加缪索先生以庭长的身份决不宜牵入这种不清不白的事。两人把话说完就走了。

“哎，太太，那两位先生呢？”弗莱齐埃走出来问。

“走啦！……他们劝我放弃这件事！”玛维尔太太回答。

“放弃！”弗莱齐埃勉强抑捺着胸中的怒意说，“太太，您听着……”

于是他念出代执达吏起草的传票底稿：

兹据××××××状称……（套语从略）事缘汉纳耿与克洛泰二公证人，会同两外籍证人勃罗纳与希华勃，将故邦斯先生遗嘱送呈地方法院，请求执管遗产在案。查故邦斯先生将遗产赠予德国人许模克先生之行为，实属侵害具状人之权利；因具状人乃系故邦斯先生之法定的血亲继承人，而邦斯先生生前亦明白表示愿将遗产授予具状人之生女赛西尔小姐。关于此点，具状人可提出社会上素有声望之人士为证。讵许模克先生不惜以卑鄙伎俩，非法手段，乘病人神志昏迷之际赚取遗嘱；甚至于事先禁锢邦斯先生，使其不能接见家属，以遂其夺取遗产之阴谋；而一旦目的达到，于主办邦斯先生丧葬之时，许模克立即忘恩负义，行同禽兽，致引起邻里公愤。此外尚有其他罪行，具状人现方搜集证据，以备日后当庭陈述。基于上述理由，具状人特请求法院宣示撤销故邦斯先生遗嘱，并将其遗产判归血亲继承人依法执管。据此，本执达吏依法当面票传许模克于×月×日到庭，听候审理撤销故邦斯遗嘱一案。本执达吏并根据具状人请求，反对许模克取得受遗赠人之身份，并反对其执管遗产……（下略） [1]

“庭长太太，我知道那个人的，他一收到这张请帖就会让步。他跟泰勃罗一商量，泰勃罗就会劝他接受我们的办法！您愿不愿意送他三千法郎的终身年金呢？”

“当然愿意，我恨不得现在就把第一期的款子付了。”

“哦，三天之内一定办妥……他悲痛之下，拿到这张传票会大吃一惊的，因为这可怜虫的确在那里哀悼邦斯。他把朋友的死看作很大的损失。”

“传票送了出去还能收回吗？”庭长太太问。

“当然能收回，太太，案子随时可以撤销的。”

“那么，先生，行了！……你去办吧！……你替我张罗的那份家私值得我们这样干的！我已经把维丹先生退休的事给安排好了，只要你给他六万法郎；这笔钱将来在邦斯的遗产项下支付。所以瞧……我们非成功不可！……”

“他已经答应辞职了吗？”

“答应了，维丹绝对听庭长的话……”

“好吧，太太，我早先预备给西卜太太，那个下流的看门女人，六万法郎，现在我替您省掉了。可是梭伐女人的烟草牌照一定得给的，还有我朋友波冷，希望能补上养老院主任医师的缺。”

“没有问题，都预备好了。”

“那么万事齐备了……为这件事大家都在替您出力，就是戏院的经理高狄沙也很帮忙。昨天我去看他，因为戏院里有个当差可能跟我们捣乱，高狄沙答应把他压下去。”

“哦！我知道。高狄沙完全是包比诺家的人！”

弗莱齐埃走了。可是他没有碰到高狄沙，那份催命符一般的传票马上给送了出去。

二十分钟以后，高狄沙来报告他和许模克的谈话，那时庭长太太心中的欢喜，是一切贪心的人都能了解，一切诚实的人都切齿痛恨的。她完全赞成高狄沙的办法，觉得他的话入情入理，而且自己的顾虑也给他一扫而空了，更对他感激不尽。

“庭长太太，”他说，“我来的时候就想到，那可怜虫有了钱还不知道怎办呢。他的忠厚淳朴，简直像古时的长老。那种天真，那种德国人脾气，竟可以把他放在玻璃罩底下，像蜡制的小耶稣般供起来！我看他拿了两千五年金已经为难死了，要不荒唐一下才怪呢……”

“戏院里的当差追悼我们的舅舅，他就送他一笔钱，足见他宅心仁厚。当初就怪那件小事，造成了我跟邦斯先生的误会；要是他再到我们家来的话，一切都会原谅他的。你真不知道我丈夫多么想念他。这一回没有得到他的死讯，庭长心里难过得不得了；他对亲属之间的礼数看得极重，要是知道了邦斯舅舅故世，一定要上教堂，要去送丧，连我也会去参加他的弥撒祭的……”

“那么，美丽的太太，”高狄沙说，“请你教人把和解据预备起来；准四点，我替你把德国人带来……太太，希望你在令爱包比诺子爵夫人面前为我吹嘘吹嘘；也希望她对她的公公，对我那位显赫的老朋友，对这个大政治家提一句，说我对他所有的亲属都愿意尽心出力，请他继续高抬贵手，提拔提拔我。他那个当法官的叔叔救过我的命，这几年他又让我发了财……太太，像你跟令爱这样有权有势的人，当然是众望所归，万人景仰，我很想沾点儿光。我的计划是想脱离戏院，做个有作为的人。”

“你现在不是很有作为了吗，先生？”

“你太好了！”高狄沙说着，吻着庭长太太那只干枯的手。

注解：

[1]　法国执达吏的职权，除执行法院判决，为强制执行及假扣押等以外，得签发诉讼案件及非诉讼案件的传票，并负责送达。又以许模克委托泰勃罗为代表而论，执达吏似亦能接受私人委托代办非诉讼案件，但此点在现代法国诉讼程序上无可查考。又执达吏另有事务所，雇有书记等等助理其事。





结局


当天四点钟，贝蒂哀公证人的事务所里，陆续来了和解书的起草人弗莱齐埃，许模克的代理人泰勃罗，还有许模克本人也由高狄沙陪着来了。弗莱齐埃在贝蒂哀的书桌上放着六千法郎和第一期的年金六百法郎钞票，有心让许模克看到。他果然看了那许多钱愣住了，对于人家宣读的和解书内容，连一个字都没听进去。可怜虫在墓上向邦斯默祷了一番，说不久就要去跟他相会。他在回家的路上给高狄沙拉到说许模克亲自到场，由代理人泰勃罗在旁协助，以及庭长为女儿提起诉讼等等的案由，许模克一概没有听见。那时德国人显而易见当了个倒霉角色，因为他签这份和解书，等于承认弗莱齐埃状子上的话是事实。但他看到有这么多钱可以拿去给多比那，让那个唯一敬爱邦斯的人有好日子过，简直高兴之极，再也不把什么和解据听在耳里。

他们把文件念到一半，贝蒂哀手下的一个书记进来向主人报告说：“先生，有个人要找许模克先生……”

公证人看见弗莱齐埃做了个手势，便特意耸了耸肩膀，说道：

“我们在签订文件的时候，千万别来打搅！你去问问那个人的姓名……是个普通人还是上等人？是不是什么债主？……”

书记回来报告说：“他一定要跟许模克先生说话。”

“他姓什么？”

“多比那。”

“我去，你尽管签字，”高狄沙对许模克说，“让我去问他有什么事。”

高狄沙明白了弗莱齐埃的意思，他们都咂摸到可能有点儿危险。

“你到这儿来干什么？”经理对当差说，“难道你不想当出纳吗？出纳员第一个条件是谨慎小心。”

“先生……”

“你走吧；再管闲事，你的差事就砸了。”

“先生，倘使每一口面包都要塞着我喉咙管，我是咽不下去的！……许模克先生！”他叫起来。

许模克签过了字，手里抓着钱，听见多比那的声音，跑来了。

“这是给你和德国娃娃的……”

“哎啊！亲爱的许模克先生，那些狐群狗党想破坏你名誉，你倒让他们发了财。我把这张传票给一个规矩人，一个认得弗莱齐埃的诉讼代理人看过了，他说你不应该怕打官司，他们作恶多端，应当受点儿惩罚，并且你一接受他们的诉讼，他们会退缩的……你把这个文件念一念吧。”这位冒失的朋友把送到鲍打弄的传票递给许模克。

许模克接过来念了，才知道受了诬蔑，可还不明白这些糟蹋他的话是怎么回事，只觉得挨了一记闷棍。他心口好似给一颗石子塞住了，当场晕倒在多比那怀里。他们正在公证人屋子的大门下，恰好有辆车在街上过，多比那就把可怜的德国人抱上了车。他已经发作脑溢血，眼睛看不清了，可还挣扎着把钱交给多比那。许模克并不就死，但从此没有清醒过来，不饮不食，只有些无意识的动作。十天之后，他死了，连哼也不哼一声，因为他早已不能开口。他病中由多比那太太服侍；死后由多比那张罗着，无声无臭地给埋了，就葬在邦斯旁边；送丧的人也只有多比那一个。

弗莱齐埃当上了初级法庭庭长，在加缪索府上走得很熟。庭长夫人非常赏识他，不赞成他娶泰勃罗那等人的女儿，答应给他介绍一门比这个胜过万倍的亲事。庭长太太觉得，不但买进玛维尔的草场跟庄子都是他出的力，连庭长在一八四六年国会改选时当选议员也是他的功劳。

本书的故事，不幸连许多细节都是事实；它与它的姊妹作[1]放在一起，更足以证明人的性格在社会上有极大的作用。读者谅必都想知道本书主人翁的下落；而我说的主人翁，凡是收藏家、鉴赏家、古董商全会猜到是指邦斯的收藏。那么只要把下面一段对话提一提就行了，因为就在不久以前，包比诺伯爵招待几个外国人在家里看画。

“伯爵，你收藏的全是宝物！”一个英国绅士说。

“哦！爵爷，”包比诺很谦虚地回答，“关于图画的收藏，不但在巴黎，就是在欧洲，也没有人敢和那不知名的犹太人，叫作埃里·玛古斯的相比。他是个怪物，可以说是收藏图画的巨擘。他搜集的一百多幅画，简直教所有的收藏家望而却步，不敢再想收藏。法国政府真该花上七八百万，等这个守财奴故世之后把他的美术馆买下来……至于古董古玩，那么我的这一批还不算坏，值得人家一提的了……”

“可是像你这样的忙人，你当初的家业又是光明正大靠经商挣来的，怎么能……”

“对啦，”包比诺伯爵接口道，“靠卖药起家的，怎么会再去买进些起码东西……”

“不是这意思，”外国客人抢着说，“我奇怪你怎么能有时间去找！古玩古董不会自己来找你的……”

“我公公喜欢美术，原来就有些收藏，”包比诺子爵夫人插言道，“可是宝物之中最大的部分是我从家里带来的！”

“怎么，太太，是你带来的！……你这样年轻，已经有这种癖了？……”一位俄国亲王说。

俄国人最喜欢模仿别人，所以一切文明的病都会在他们国内蔓延。玩古董的习气在圣彼得堡风靡一时，再加他们那种天真的勇猛，把货价抬得那么高，简直令人没法再买东西。那位亲王便是专程到巴黎来收古董的。

“王爷，”子爵夫人说，“这批宝物是一个非常喜欢我的舅公传给我的。他从一八〇五起，花了四十多年在各地收集这些精品，主要是在意大利……”

“他姓什么？”那位英国爵爷问。

“邦斯！”加缪索庭长回答。

“他是个挺可爱的人，”庭长太太装着很甜蜜的声音，“挺有风趣，挺古怪，同时心地又好得不得了。爵爷，你刚才赞美的那把扇子，原是蓬巴杜夫人的遗物，邦斯先生送给我的时候还说过一句妙语，可是原谅我不告诉你了……”她说完了望着女儿。

“子爵夫人，”俄国亲王说，“请你告诉我们吧。”

“哦，那句话跟扇子一样名贵！……”子爵夫人回答，她说话就喜欢用这种滥调，“他对家母说：‘宠姬荡妇之物，早该入于大贤大德之手。’”

英国爵爷望着玛维尔太太，那种表示不信的神气，在一个毫无风韵的女人是看了最舒服的。庭长太太接着又说：

“他每星期要在我们家吃三四次饭，他真喜欢我们！我们也非常了解他；艺术家最得意的是有人赏识他们的才气。并且玛维尔先生是他独一无二的亲属。可是他得这笔遗产完全是出乎意外。包比诺伯爵不忍心让这批收藏给送出去拍卖，便全部买了下来；而我们也觉得这么办最合适。倘使把舅舅多么爱好的精品散失出去，我们心里也不好过。给这批东西估价的便是埃里·玛古斯……爵爷，我们这样才买下了令叔在玛维尔盖的那所别庄，以后还希望你赏光上那儿去玩。”

高狄沙把戏院盘给别人已有一年了，多比那还在那里当出纳。可是他变得沉默寡言，愤世嫉俗；人家觉得他像犯了什么罪；戏院里某些缺德的人，还说他的抑郁不欢是娶了洛洛德的缘故。诚实的多比那，只要听见弗莱齐埃的名字就会吓得直跳。也许有人奇怪，品格配得上邦斯的人只有一个，而这一个倒是戏院里的小职员。

雷蒙诺克太太鉴于封丹太太的预言，不愿意住到乡下去养老；她在玛特兰纳大街上一家漂亮铺子里又做了寡妇。雷蒙诺克因为婚约上订明夫妇一方死亡时，遗产即归对方承受，便有心在老婆身边摆着一小杯硫酸，希望她无意中会弄错；他老婆看见了，好意把杯子换了个地方，不料雷蒙诺克竟拿去一饮而尽。这恶棍的下场当然是自食其果，同时也证明上帝还是有赏罚的。一般人往往责备描写社会风俗的作家把这一点给忘了，其实是大家看那种千篇一律的，善有善报、恶有恶报的戏看得太多了。

I


Towards three o'clock in the afternoon of one October day in the year 1844, a man of sixty or thereabouts, whom anybody might have credited with more than his actual age, was walking along the Boulevard des Italiens with his head bent down, as if he were tracking some one. There was a smug expression about the mouth—he looked like a merchant who has just done a good stroke of business, or a bachelor emerging from a boudoir in the best of humors with himself; and in Paris this is the highest degree of self-satisfaction ever registered by a human countenance. As soon as the elderly person appeared in the distance, a smile broke out over the faces of the frequenters of the boulevard, who daily, from their chairs, watch the passers-by, and indulge in the agreeable pastime of analyzing them. That smile is peculiar to Parisians; it says so many things—ironical, quizzical, pitying; but nothing save the rarest of human curiosities can summon that look of interest to the faces of Parisians, sated as they are with every possible sight.

A saying recorded of Hyacinthe, an actor celebrated for his repartees, will explain the archaeological value of the old gentleman, and the smile repeated like an echo by all eyes. Somebody once asked Hyacinthe where the hats were made that set the house in a roar as soon as he appeared. "I don't have them made," he said; "I keep them!" So also among the million actors who make up the great troupe of Paris, there are unconscious Hyacinthes who "keep" all the absurd freaks of vanished fashions upon their backs; and the apparition of some bygone decade will startle you into laughter as you walk the streets in bitterness of soul over the treason of one who was your friend in the past.

In some respects the passer-by adhered so faithfully to the fashions of the year 1806, that he was not so much a burlesque caricature as a reproduction of the Empire period. To an observer, accuracy of detail in a revival of this sort is extremely valuable, but accuracy of detail, to be properly appreciated, demands the critical attention of an expert flaneur; while the man in the street who raises a laugh as soon as he comes in sight is bound to be one of those outrageous exhibitions which stare you in the face, as the saying goes, and produce the kind of effect which an actor tries to secure for the success of his entry. The elderly person, a thin, spare man, wore a nut-brown spencer over a coat of uncertain green, with white metal buttons. A man in a spencer in the year 1844! it was as if Napoleon himself had vouchsafed to come to life again for a couple of hours.

The spencer, as its name indicates, was the invention of an English lord, vain, doubtless, of his handsome shape. Some time before the Peace of Amiens, this nobleman solved the problem of covering the bust without destroying the outlines of the figure and encumbering the person with the hideous boxcoat, now finishing its career on the backs of aged hackney cabmen; but, elegant figures being in the minority, the success of the spencer was short-lived in France, English though it was. At the sight of the spencer, men of forty or fifty mentally invested the wearer with top-boots, pistachio-colored kerseymere small clothes adorned with a knot of ribbon; and beheld themselves in the costumes of their youth. Elderly ladies thought of former conquests; but the younger men were asking each other why the aged Alcibiades had cut off the skirts of his overcoat. The rest of the costume was so much in keeping with the spencer, that you would not have hesitated to call the wearer "an Empire man," just as you call a certain kind of furniture "Empire furniture;" yet the newcomer only symbolized the Empire for those who had known that great and magnificent epoch at any rate de visu, for a certain accuracy of memory was needed for the full appreciation of the costume, and even now the Empire is so far away that not every one of us can picture it in its Gallo-Grecian reality.

The stranger's hat, for instance, tipped to the back of his head so as to leave almost the whole forehead bare, recalled a certain jaunty air, with which civilians and officials attempted to swagger it with military men; but the hat itself was a shocking specimen of the fifteen-franc variety. Constant friction with a pair of enormous ears had left their marks which no brush could efface from the underside of the brim; the silk tissue (as usual) fitted badly over the cardboard foundation, and hung in wrinkles here and there; and some skin-disease (apparently) had attacked the nap in spite of the hand which rubbed it down of a morning.

Beneath the hat, which seemed ready to drop off at any moment, lay an expanse of countenance grotesque and droll, as the faces which the Chinese alone of all people can imagine for their quaint curiosities. The broad visage was as full of holes as a colander, honeycombed with the shadows of the dints, hollowed out like a Roman mask. It set all the laws of anatomy at defiance. Close inspection failed to detect the substructure. Where you expected to find a bone, you discovered a layer of cartilaginous tissue, and the hollows of an ordinary human face were here filled out with flabby bosses. A pair of gray eyes, red-rimmed and lashless, looked forlornly out of a countenance which was flattened something after the fashion of a pumpkin, and surmounted by a Don Quixote nose that rose out of it like a monolith above a plain. It was the kind of nose, as Cervantes must surely have explained somewhere, which denotes an inborn enthusiasm for all things great, a tendency which is apt to degenerate into credulity. And yet, though the man's ugliness was something almost ludicrous, it aroused not the slightest inclination to laugh. The exceeding melancholy which found an outlet in the poor man's faded eyes reached the mocker himself and froze the gibes on his lips; for all at once the thought arose that this was a human creature to whom Nature had forbidden any expression of love or tenderness, since such expression could only be painful or ridiculous to the woman he loved. In the presence of such misfortune a Frenchman is silent; to him it seems the most cruel of all afflictions—to be unable to please!





II


The man so ill-favored was dressed after the fashion of shabby gentility, a fashion which the rich not seldom try to copy. He wore low shoes beneath gaiters of the pattern worn by the Imperial Guard, doubtless for the sake of economy, because they kept the socks clean. The rusty tinge of his black breeches, like the cut and the white or shiny line of the creases, assigned the date of the purchase some three years back. The roomy garments failed to disguise the lean proportions of the wearer, due apparently rather to constitution than to a Pythagorean regimen, for the worthy man was endowed with thick lips and a sensual mouth; and when he smiled, displayed a set of white teeth which would have done credit to a shark. A shawl-waistcoat, likewise of black cloth, was supplemented by a white under-waistcoat, and yet again beneath this gleamed the edge of a red knitted under-jacket, to put you in mind of Garat's five waistcoats. A huge white muslin stock with a conspicuous bow, invented by some exquisite to charm "the charming sex" in 1809, projected so far above the wearer's chin that the lower part of his face was lost, as it were, in a muslin abyss. A silk watch-guard, plaited to resemble the keepsakes made of hair, meandered down the shirt front and secured his watch from the improbable theft. The greenish coat, though older by some three years than the breeches, was remarkably neat; the black velvet collar and shining metal buttons, recently renewed, told of carefulness which descended even to trifles.

The particular manner of fixing the hat on the occiput, the triple waistcoat, the vast cravat engulfing the chin, the gaiters, the metal buttons on the greenish coat,—all these reminiscences of Imperial fashions were blended with a sort of afterwaft and lingering perfume of the coquetry of the Incroyable—with an indescribable finical something in the folds of the garments, a certain air of stiffness and correctness in the demeanor that smacked of the school of David, that recalled Jacob's spindle-legged furniture. At first sight, moreover, you set him down either for the gentleman by birth fallen a victim to some degrading habit, or for the man of small independent means whose expenses are calculated to such a nicety that the breakage of a windowpane, a rent in a coat, or a visit from the philanthropic pest who asks you for subscriptions to a charity, absorbs the whole of a month's little surplus of pocket-money. If you had seen him that afternoon, you would have wondered how that grotesque face came to be lighted up with a smile; usually, surely, it must have worn the dispirited, passive look of the obscure toiler condemned to labor without ceasing for the barest necessaries of life. Yet when you noticed that the odd-looking old man was carrying some object (evidently precious) in his right hand with a mother's care; concealing it under the skirts of his coat to keep it from collisions in the crowd, and still more, when you remarked that important air always assumed by an idler when intrusted with a commission, you would have suspected him of recovering some piece of lost property, some modern equivalent of the marquise's poodle; you would have recognized the assiduous gallantry of the "man of the Empire" returning in triumph from his mission to some charming woman of sixty, reluctant as yet to dispense with the daily visit of her elderly attentif. In Paris only among great cities will you see such spectacles as this; for of her boulevards Paris makes a stage where a never-ending drama is played gratuitously by the French nation in the interests of Art.





III


In spite of the rashly assumed spencer, you would scarcely have thought, after a glance at the contours of the man's bony frame, that this was an artist—that conventional type which is privileged, in something of the same way as a Paris gamin, to represent riotous living to the bourgeois and philistine mind, the most mirific joviality, in short (to use the old Rabelaisian word newly taken into use). Yet this elderly person had once taken the medal and the traveling scholarship; he had composed the first cantata crowned by the Institut at the time of the re-establishment of the Academie de Rome; he was M. Sylvain Pons, in fact—M. Sylvain Pons, whose name appears on the covers of well-known sentimental songs trilled by our mothers, to say nothing of a couple of operas, played in 1815 and 1816, and divers unpublished scores. The worthy soul was now ending his days as the conductor of an orchestra in a boulevard theatre, and a music master in several young ladies' boarding-schools, a post for which his face particularly recommended him. He was entirely dependent upon his earnings. Running about to give private lessons at his age!—Think of it. How many a mystery lies in that unromantic situation!

But the last man to wear the spencer carried something about him besides his Empire Associations; a warning and a lesson was written large over that triple waistcoat. Wherever he went, he exhibited, without fee or charge, one of the many victims of the fatal system of competition which still prevails in France in spite of a century of trial without result; for Poisson de Marigny, brother of the Pompadour and Director of Fine Arts, somewhere about 1746 invented this method of applying pressure to the brain. That was a hundred years ago. Try if you can count upon your fingers the men of genius among the prizemen of those hundred years. In the first place, no deliberate effort of schoolmaster or administrator can replace the miracles of chance which produce great men: of all the mysteries of generation, this most defies the ambitious modern scientific investigator. In the second—the ancient Egyptians (we are told) invented incubator-stoves for hatching eggs; what would be thought of Egyptians who should neglect to fill the beaks of the callow fledglings? Yet this is precisely what France is doing. She does her utmost to produce artists by the artificial heat of competitive examination; but, the sculptor, painter, engraver, or musician once turned out by this mechanical process, she no more troubles herself about them and their fate than the dandy cares for yesterday's flower in his buttonhole. And so it happens that the really great man is a Greuze, a Watteau, a Felicien David, a Pagnesi, a Gericault, a Decamps, an Auber, a David d'Angers, an Eugene Delacroix, or a Meissonier—artists who take but little heed of grande prix, and spring up in the open field under the rays of that invisible sun called Vocation.

The Government sent Sylvain Pons to Rome to make a great musician of himself; and in Rome Sylvain Pons acquired a taste for the antique and works of art. He became an admirable judge of those masterpieces of the brain and hand which are summed up by the useful neologism "bric-a-brac;" and when the child of Euterpe returned to Paris somewhere about the year 1810, it was in the character of a rabid collector, loaded with pictures, statuettes, frames, wood-carving, ivories, enamels, porcelains, and the like. He had sunk the greater part of his patrimony, not so much in the purchases themselves as on the expenses of transit; and every penny inherited from his mother had been spent in the course of a three-years' travel in Italy after the residence in Rome came to an end. He had seen Venice, Milan, Florence, Bologna, and Naples leisurely, as he wished to see them, as a dreamer of dreams, and a philosopher; careless of the future, for an artist looks to his talent for support as the fille de joie counts upon her beauty. All through those splendid years of travel Pons was as happy as was possible to a man with a great soul, a sensitive nature, and a face so ugly that any "success with the fair" (to use the stereotyped formula of 1809) was out of the question; the realities of life always fell short of the ideals which Pons created for himself; the world without was not in tune with the soul within, but Pons had made up his mind to the dissonance. Doubtless the sense of beauty that he had kept pure and living in his inmost soul was the spring from which the delicate, graceful, and ingenious music flowed and won him reputation between 1810 and 1814. Every reputation founded upon the fashion or the fancy of the hour, or upon the short-lived follies of Paris, produces its Pons. No place in the world is so inexorable in great things; no city of the globe so disdainfully indulgent in small. Pons' notes were drowned before long in floods of German harmony and the music of Rossini; and if in 1824 he was known as an agreeable musician, a composer of various drawing-room melodies, judge if he was likely to be famous in 183l! In 1844, the year in which the single drama of this obscure life began, Sylvain Pons was of no more value than an antediluvian semiquaver; dealers in music had never heard of his name, though he was still composing, on scanty pay, for his own orchestra or for neighboring theatres.

And yet, the worthy man did justice to the great masters of our day; a masterpiece finely rendered brought tears to his eyes; but his religion never bordered on mania, as in the case of Hoffmann's Kreislers; he kept his enthusiasm to himself; his delight, like the paradise reached by opium or hashish, lay within his own soul. The gift of admiration, of comprehension, the single faculty by which the ordinary man becomes the brother of the poet, is rare in the city of Paris, that inn whither all ideas, like travelers, come to stay for awhile; so rare is it, that Pons surely deserves our respectful esteem. His personal failure may seem anomalous, but he frankly admitted that he was weak in harmony. He had neglected the study of counterpoint; there was a time when he might have begun his studies afresh and held his own among modern composers, when he might have been, not certainly a Rossini, but a Herold. But he was alarmed by the intricacies of modern orchestration; and at length, in the pleasures of collecting, he found such ever-renewed compensation for his failure, that if he had been made to choose between his curiosities and the fame of Rossini—will it be believed?—Pons would have pronounced for his beloved collection. Pons was of the opinion of Chenavard, the print-collector, who laid it down as an axiom—that you only fully enjoy the pleasure of looking at your Ruysdael, Hobbema, Holbein, Raphael, Murillo, Greuze, Sebastiano del Piombo, Giorgione, Albrecht Durer, or what not, when you have paid less than sixty francs for your picture. Pons never gave more than a hundred francs for any purchase. If he laid out as much as fifty francs, he was careful to assure himself beforehand that the object was worth three thousand. The most beautiful thing in the world, if it cost three hundred francs, did not exist for Pons. Rare had been his bargains; but he possessed the three qualifications for success—a stag's legs, an idler's disregard of time, and the patience of a Jew.

This system, carried out for forty years, in Rome or Paris alike, had borne its fruits. Since Pons returned from Italy, he had regularly spent about two thousand francs a year upon a collection of masterpieces of every sort and description, a collection hidden away from all eyes but his own; and now his catalogue had reached the incredible number of 1907. Wandering about Paris between 1811 and 1816, he had picked up many a treasure for ten francs, which would fetch a thousand or twelve hundred to-day. Some forty-five thousand canvases change hands annually in Paris picture sales, and these Pons had sifted through year by year. Pons had Sevres porcelain, pate tendre, bought of Auvergnats, those satellites of the Black Band who sacked chateaux and carried off the marvels of Pompadour France in their tumbril carts; he had, in fact, collected the drifted wreck of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries; he recognized the genius of the French school, and discerned the merit of the Lepautres and Lavallee-Poussins and the rest of the great obscure creators of the Genre Louis Quinze and the Genre Louis Seize. Our modern craftsmen now draw without acknowledgment from them, pore incessantly over the treasures of the Cabinet des Estampes, borrow adroitly, and give out their pastiches for new inventions. Pons had obtained many a piece by exchange, and therein lies the ineffable joy of the collector. The joy of buying bric-a-brac is a secondary delight; in the give-and-take of barter lies the joy of joys. Pons had begun by collecting snuff-boxes and miniatures; his name was unknown in bric-a-bracology, for he seldom showed himself in salesrooms or in the shops of well-known dealers; Pons was not aware that his treasures had any commercial value.

The late lamented Dusommerard tried his best to gain Pons' confidence, but the prince of bric-a-brac died before he could gain an entrance to the Pons museum, the one private collection which could compare with the famous Sauvageot museum. Pons and M. Sauvageot indeed resembled each other in more ways than one. M. Sauvageot, like Pons, was a musician; he was likewise a comparatively poor man, and he had collected his bric-a-brac in much the same way, with the same love of art, the same hatred of rich capitalists with well-known names who collect for the sake of running up prices as cleverly as possible. There was yet another point of resemblance between the pair; Pons, like his rival competitor and antagonist, felt in his heart an insatiable craving after specimens of the craftsman's skill and miracles of workmanship; he loved them as a man might love a fair mistress; an auction in the salerooms in the Rue des Jeuneurs, with its accompaniments of hammer strokes and brokers' men, was a crime of lese-bric-a-brac in Pons' eyes. Pons' museum was for his own delight at every hour; for the soul created to know and feel all the beauty of a masterpiece has this in common with the lover—to-day's joy is as great as the joy of yesterday; possession never palls; and a masterpiece, happily, never grows old. So the object that he held in his hand with such fatherly care could only be a "find," carried off with what affection amateurs alone know!

After the first outlines of this biographical sketch, every one will cry at once, "Why! this is the happiest man on earth, in spite of his ugliness!" And, in truth, no spleen, no dullness can resist the counter-irritant supplied by a "craze," the intellectual moxa of a hobby. You who can no longer drink of "the cup of pleasure," as it has been called through all ages, try to collect something, no matter what (people have been known to collect placards), so shall you receive the small change for the gold ingot of happiness. Have you a hobby? You have transferred pleasure to the plane of ideas. And yet, you need not envy the worthy Pons; such envy, like all kindred sentiments, would be founded upon a misapprehension.

With a nature so sensitive, with a soul that lived by tireless admiration of the magnificent achievements of art, of the high rivalry between human toil and the work of Nature—Pons was a slave to that one of the Seven Deadly Sins with which God surely will deal least hardly; Pons was a glutton. A narrow income, combined with a passion for bric-a-brac, condemned him to a regimen so abhorrent to a discriminating palate, that, bachelor as he was, he had cut the knot of the problem by dining out every day. Now, in the time of the Empire, celebrities were more sought after than at present, perhaps because there were so few of them, perhaps because they made little or no political pretension. In those days, besides, you could set up for a poet, a musician, or a painter, with so little expense. Pons, being regarded as the probable rival of Niccolo, Paer, and Berton, used to receive so many invitations, that he was forced to keep a list of engagements, much as barristers note down the cases for which they are retained. And Pons behaved like an artist. He presented his amphitryons with copies of his songs, he "obliged" at the pianoforte, he brought them orders for boxes at the Feydeau, his own theatre, he organized concerts, he was not above taking the fiddle himself sometimes in a relation's house, and getting up a little impromptu dance.





IV


In those days, all the handsome men in France were away at the wars exchanging sabre-cuts with the handsome men of the Coalition. Pons was said to be, not ugly, but "peculiar-looking," after the grand rule laid down by Moliere in Eliante's famous couplets; but if he sometimes heard himself described as a "charming man" (after he had done some fair lady a service), his good fortune went no further than words.

It was between the years 1810 and 1816 that Pons contracted the unlucky habit of dining out; he grew accustomed to see his hosts taking pains over the dinner, procuring the first and best of everything, bringing out their choicest vintages, seeing carefully to the dessert, the coffee, the liqueurs, giving him of their best, in short; the best, moreover, of those times of the Empire when Paris was glutted with kings and queens and princes, and many a private house emulated royal splendours. People used to play at Royalty then as they play nowadays at parliament, creating a whole host of societies with presidents, vice-presidents, secretaries and what not—agricultural societies, industrial societies, societies for the promotion of sericulture, viticulture, the growth of flax, and so forth. Some have even gone so far as to look about them for social evils in order to start a society to cure them.

But to return to Pons. A stomach thus educated is sure to react upon the owner's moral fibre; the demoralization of the man varies directly with his progress in culinary sapience. Voluptuousness, lurking in every secret recess of the heart, lays down the law therein. Honor and resolution are battered in breach. The tyranny of the palate has never been described; as a necessity of life it escapes the criticism of literature; yet no one imagines how many have been ruined by the table. The luxury of the table is indeed, in this sense, the courtesan's one competitor in Paris, besides representing in a manner the credit side in another account, where she figures as the expenditure. With Pons' decline and fall as an artist came his simultaneous transformation from invited guest to parasite and hanger-on; he could not bring himself to quit dinners so excellently served for the Spartan broth of a two-franc ordinary. Alas! alas! a shudder ran through him at the mere thought of the great sacrifices which independence required him to make. He felt that he was capable of sinking to even lower depths for the sake of good living, if there were no other way of enjoying the first and best of everything, of guzzling (vulgar but expressive word) nice little dishes carefully prepared. Pons lived like a bird, pilfering his meal, flying away when he had taken his fill, singing a few notes by way of return; he took a certain pleasure in the thought that he lived at the expense of society, which asked of him—what but the trifling toll of grimaces? Like all confirmed bachelors, who hold their lodgings in horror, and live as much as possible in other people's houses, Pons was accustomed to the formulas and facial contortions which do duty for feeling in the world; he used compliments as small change; and as far as others were concerned, he was satisfied with the labels they bore, and never plunged a too-curious hand into the sack.

This not intolerable phase lasted for another ten years. Such years! Pons' life was closing with a rainy autumn. All through those years he contrived to dine without expense by making himself necessary in the houses which he frequented. He took the first step in the downward path by undertaking a host of small commissions; many and many a time Pons ran on errands instead of the porter or the servant; many a purchase he made for his entertainers. He became a kind of harmless, well-meaning spy, sent by one family into another; but he gained no credit with those for whom he trudged about, and so often sacrificed self-respect.

"Pons is a bachelor," said they; "he is at a loss to know what to do with his time; he is only too glad to trot about for us.—What else would he do?"

Very soon the cold which old age spreads about itself began to set in; the communicable cold which sensibly lowers the social temperature, especially if the old man is ugly and poor. Old and ugly and poor—is not this to be thrice old? Pons' winter had begun, the winter which brings the reddened nose, and frost-nipped cheeks, and the numbed fingers, numb in how many ways!

From 1836 to 1843, invitations very seldom came for Pons. So far from seeking the society of the parasite, every family accepted him much as they accepted the taxes; they valued nothing that Pons could do for them; real services from Pons counted for nought. The family circles in which the worthy artist revolved had no respect for art or letters; they went down on their knees to practical results; they valued nothing but the fortune or social position acquired since the year 1830. The bourgeoisie is afraid of intellect and genius, but Pons' spirit and manner were not haughty enough to overawe his relations, and naturally he had come at last to be accounted less than nothing with them, though he was not altogether despised. He had suffered acutely among them, but, like all timid creatures, he kept silence as to his pain; and so by degrees schooled himself to hide his feelings, and learned to take sanctuary in his inmost self. Many superficial persons interpret this conduct by the short word "selfishness;" and, indeed, the resemblance between the egoist and the solitary human creature is strong enough to seem to justify the harsher verdict; and this is especially true in Paris, where nobody observes others closely, where all things pass swift as waves, and last as little as a Ministry.

So Cousin Pons was accused of selfishness (behind his back); and if the world accuses any one, it usually finds him guilty and condemns him into the bargain. Pons bowed to the decision. Do any of us know how such a timid creature is cast down by an unjust judgment? Who will ever paint all that the timid suffer? This state of things, now growing daily worse, explains the sad expression on the poor old musician's face; he lived by capitulations of which he was ashamed. Every time we sin against self-respect at the bidding of the ruling passion, we rivet its hold upon us; the more that passion requires of us, the stronger it grows, every sacrifice increasing, as it were, the value of a satisfaction for which so much has been given up, till the negative sum-total of renouncements looms very large in a man's imagination. Pons, for instance, after enduring the insolently patronizing looks of some bourgeois, incased in buckram of stupidity, sipped his glass of port or finished his quail with breadcrumbs, and relished something of the savor of revenge, besides. "It is not too dear at the price!" he said to himself.

After all, in the eyes of the moralist, there were extenuating circumstances in Pons' case. Man only lives, in fact, by some personal satisfaction. The passionless, perfectly righteous man is not human; he is a monster, an angel wanting wings. The angel of Christian mythology has nothing but a head. On earth, the righteous person is the sufficiently tiresome Grandison, for whom the very Venus of the Crosswords is sexless. Setting aside one or two commonplace adventures in Italy, in which probably the climate accounted for his success, no woman had ever smiled upon Pons. Plenty of men are doomed to this fate. Pons was an abnormal birth; the child of parents well stricken in years, he bore the stigma of his untimely genesis; his cadaverous complexion might have been contracted in the flask of spirit-of-wine in which science preserves some extraordinary foetus. Artist though he was, with his tender, dreamy, sensitive soul, he was forced to accept the character which belonged to his face; it was hopeless to think of love, and he remained a bachelor, not so much of choice as of necessity. Then Gluttony, the sin of the continent monk, beckoned to Pons; he rushed upon temptation, as he had thrown his whole soul into the adoration of art and the cult of music. Good cheer and bric-a-brac gave him the small change for the love which could spend itself in no other way. As for music, it was his profession, and where will you find the man who is in love with his means of earning a livelihood? For it is with a profession as with marriage: in the long length you are sensible of nothing but the drawbacks.

Brillat-Savarin has deliberately set himself to justify the gastronome, but perhaps even he has not dwelt sufficiently on the reality of the pleasures of the table. The demands of digestion upon the human economy produce an internal wrestling-bout of human forces which rivals the highest degree of amorous pleasure. The gastronome is conscious of an expenditure of vital power, an expenditure so vast that the brain is atrophied (as it were), that a second brain, located in the diaphragm, may come into play, and the suspension of all the faculties is in itself a kind of intoxication. A boa constrictor gorged with an ox is so stupid with excess that the creature is easily killed. What man, on the wrong side of forty, is rash enough to work after dinner? And remark in the same connection, that all great men have been moderate eaters. The exhilarating effect of the wing of a chicken upon invalids recovering from serious illness, and long confined to a stinted and carefully chosen diet, has been frequently remarked. The sober Pons, whose whole enjoyment was concentrated in the exercise of his digestive organs, was in the position of chronic convalescence; he looked to his dinner to give him the utmost degree of pleasurable sensation, and hitherto he had procured such sensations daily. Who dares to bid farewell to old habit? Many a man on the brink of suicide has been plucked back on the threshold of death by the thought of the cafe where he plays his nightly game of dominoes.

In the year 1835, chance avenged Pons for the indifference of womankind by finding him a prop for his declining years, as the saying goes; and he, who had been old from his cradle, found a support in friendship. Pons took to himself the only life-partner permitted to him among his kind—an old man and a fellow-musician. But for La Fontaine's fable, Les Deux Amis, this sketch should have borne the title of The Two Friends; but to take the name of this divine story would surely be a deed of violence, a profanation from which every true man of letters would shrink. The title ought to be borne alone and for ever by the fabulist's masterpiece, the revelation of his soul, and the record of his dreams; those three words were set once and for ever by the poet at the head of a page which is his by a sacred right of ownership; for it is a shrine before which all generations, all over the world, will kneel so long as the art of printing shall endure.

Pons' friend gave lessons on the pianoforte. They met and struck up an acquaintance in 1834, one prize day at a boarding-school; and so congenial were their ways of thinking and living, that Pons used to say that he had found his friend too late for his happiness. Never, perhaps, did two souls, so much alike, find each other in the great ocean of humanity which flowed forth, in disobedience to the will of God, from its source in the Garden of Eden. Before very long the two musicians could not live without each other. Confidences were exchanged, and in a week's time they were like brothers. Schmucke (for that was his name) had not believed that such a man as Pons existed, nor had Pons imagined that a Schmucke was possible. Here already you have a sufficient description of the good couple; but it is not every mind that takes kindly to the concise synthetic method, and a certain amount of demonstration is necessary if the credulous are to accept the conclusion.

This pianist, was a German. A German, like the great Mendelssohn, and Steibelt, and Dreschok, and Hiller, and Leopold Hertz, Woertz, Karr, Wolff, Pixis, and Clara Wieck—and all Germans, generally speaking. Schmucke was a great musical composer doomed to remain a music master, so utterly did his character lack the audacity which a musical genius needs if he is to push his way to the front. A German's naivete does not invariably last him through his life; in some cases it fails after a certain age; and even as a cultivator of the soil brings water from afar by means of irrigation channels, so, from the springs of his youth, does the Teuton draw the simplicity which disarms suspicion—the perennial supplies with which he fertilizes his labors in every field of science, art, or commerce. A crafty Frenchman here and there will turn a Parisian tradesman's stupidity to good account in the same way. But Schmucke had kept his child's simplicity much as Pons continued to wear his relics of the Empire—all unsuspectingly. The true and noble-hearted German was at once the theatre and the audience, making music within himself for himself alone. In this city of Paris he lived as a nightingale lives among the thickets; and for twenty years he sang on, mateless, till he met with a second self in Pons. [See Une Fille d'Eve.]

Both Pons and Schmucke were abundantly given, both by heart and disposition, to the peculiarly German sentimentality which shows itself alike in childlike ways—in a passion for flowers, in that form of nature-worship which prompts a German to plant his garden-beds with big glass globes for the sake of seeing miniature pictures of the view which he can behold about him of a natural size; in the inquiring turn of mind that sets a learned Teuton trudging three hundred miles in his gaiters in search of a fact which smiles up in his face from a wayside spring, or lurks laughing under the jessamine leaves in the back-yard; or (to take a final instance) in the German craving to endow every least detail in creation with a spiritual significance, a craving which produces sometimes Hoffmann's tipsiness in type, sometimes the folios with which Germany hedges the simplest questions round about, lest haply any fool should fall into her intellectual excavations; and, indeed, if you fathom these abysses, you find nothing but a German at the bottom.

Both friends were Catholics. They went to Mass and performed the duties of religion together; and, like children, found nothing to tell their confessors. It was their firm belief that music is to feeling and thought as thought and feeling are to speech; and of their converse on this system there was no end. Each made response to the other in orgies of sound, demonstrating their convictions, each for each, like lovers. Schmucke was as absent-minded as Pons was wide-awake. Pons was a collector, Schmucke a dreamer of dreams; Schmucke was a student of beauty seen by the soul, Pons a preserver of material beauty. Pons would catch sight of a china cup and buy it in the time that Schmucke took to blow his nose, wondering the while within himself whether the musical phrase that was ringing in his brain—the motif from Rossini or Bellini or Beethoven or Mozart—had its origin or its counterpart in the world of human thought and emotion. Schmucke's economies were controlled by an absent mind, Pons was a spendthrift through passion, and for both the result was the same—they had not a penny on Saint Sylvester's day.

Perhaps Pons would have given way under his troubles if it had not been for this friendship; but life became bearable when he found some one to whom he could pour out his heart. The first time that he breathed a word of his difficulties, the good German had advised him to live as he himself did, and eat bread and cheese at home sooner than dine abroad at such a cost. Alas! Pons did not dare to confess that heart and stomach were at war within him, that he could digest affronts which pained his heart, and, cost what it might, a good dinner that satisfied his palate was a necessity to him, even as your gay Lothario must have a mistress to tease. In time Schmucke understood; not just at once, for he was too much of a Teuton to possess that gift of swift perception in which the French rejoice; Schmucke understood and loved poor Pons the better. Nothing so fortifies a friendship as a belief on the part of one friend that he is superior to the other. An angel could not have found a word to say to Schmucke rubbing his hands over the discovery of the hold that gluttony had gained over Pons. Indeed, the good German adorned their breakfast-table next morning with delicacies of which he went in search himself; and every day he was careful to provide something new for his friend, for they always breakfasted together at home.

If any one imagines that the pair could not escape ridicule in Paris, where nothing is respected, he cannot know that city. When Schmucke and Pons united their riches and poverty, they hit upon the economical expedient of lodging together, each paying half the rent of the very unequally divided second-floor of a house in the Rue de Normandie in the Marais. And as it often happened that they left home together and walked side by side along their beat of boulevard, the idlers of the quarter dubbed them "the pair of nutcrackers," a nickname which makes any portrait of Schmucke quite superfluous, for he was to Pons as the famous statue of the Nurse of Niobe in the Vatican is to the Tribune Venus.

Mme. Cibot, portress of the house in the Rue de Normandie, was the pivot on which the domestic life of the nutcrackers turned; but Mme. Cibot plays so large a part in the drama which grew out of their double existence, that it will be more appropriate to give her portrait on her first appearance in this Scene of Parisian Life.

One thing remains to be said of the characters of the pair of friends; but this one thing is precisely the hardest to make clear to ninety-nine readers out of a hundred in this forty-seventh year of the nineteenth century, perhaps by reason of the prodigious financial development brought about by the railway system. It is a little thing, and yet it is so much. It is a question, in fact, of giving an idea of the extreme sensitiveness of their natures. Let us borrow an illustration from the railways, if only by way of retaliation, as it were, for the loans which they levy upon us. The railway train of to-day, tearing over the metals, grinds away fine particles of dust, grains so minute that a traveler cannot detect them with the eye; but let a single one of those invisible motes find its way into the kidneys, it will bring about that most excruciating, and sometimes fatal, disease known as gravel. And our society, rushing like a locomotive along its metaled track, is heedless of the all but imperceptible dust made by the grinding of the wheels; but it was otherwise with the two musicians; the invisible grains of sand sank perpetually into the very fibres of their being, causing them intolerable anguish of heart. Tender exceedingly to the pain of others, they wept for their own powerlessness to help; and their own susceptibilities were almost morbidly acute. Neither age nor the continual spectacle of the drama of Paris life had hardened two souls still young and childlike and pure; the longer they lived, indeed, the more keenly they felt their inward suffering; for so it is, alas! with natures unsullied by the world, with the quiet thinker, and with such poets among the poets as have never fallen into any excess.

Since the old men began housekeeping together, the day's routine was very nearly the same for them both. They worked together in harness in the fraternal fashion of the Paris cab-horse; rising every morning, summer and winter, at seven o'clock, and setting out after breakfast to give music lessons in the boarding-schools, in which, upon occasion, they would take lessons for each other. Towards noon Pons repaired to his theatre, if there was a rehearsal on hand; but all his spare moments were spent in sauntering on the boulevards. Night found both of them in the orchestra at the theatre, for Pons had found a place for Schmucke, and upon this wise.





VI


At the time of their first meeting, Pons had just received that marshal's baton of the unknown musical composer—an appointment as conductor of an orchestra. It had come to him unasked, by a favor of Count Popinot, a bourgeois hero of July, at that time a member of the Government. Count Popinot had the license of a theatre in his gift, and Count Popinot had also an old acquaintance of the kind that the successful man blushes to meet. As he rolls through the streets of Paris in his carriage, it is not pleasant to see his boyhood's chum down at heel, with a coat of many improbable colors and trousers innocent of straps, and a head full of soaring speculations on too grand a scale to tempt shy, easily scared capital. Moreover, this friend of his youth, Gaudissart by name, had done not a little in the past towards founding the fortunes of the great house of Popinot. Popinot, now a Count and a peer of France, after twice holding a portfolio had no wish to shake off "the Illustrious Gaudissart." Quite otherwise. The pomps and vanities of the Court of the Citizen-King had not spoiled the sometime druggist's kind heart; he wished to put his ex-commercial traveler in the way of renewing his wardrobe and replenishing his purse. So when Gaudissart, always an enthusiastic admirer of the fair sex, applied for the license of a bankrupt theatre, Popinot granted it on condition that Pons (a parasite of the Hotel Popinot) should be engaged as conductor of the orchestra; and at the same time, the Count was careful to send certain elderly amateurs of beauty to the theatre, so that the new manager might be strongly supported financially by wealthy admirers of feminine charms revealed by the costume of the ballet. Gaudissart and Company, who, be it said, made their fortune, hit upon the grand idea of operas for the people, and carried it out in a boulevard theatre in 1834. A tolerable conductor, who could adapt or even compose a little music upon occasion, was a necessity for ballets and pantomimes; but the last management had so long been bankrupt, that they could not afford to keep a transposer and copyist. Pons therefore introduced Schmucke to the company as copier of music, a humble calling which requires no small musical knowledge; and Schmucke, acting on Pons' advice, came to an understanding with the chef-de-service at the Opera-Comique, so saving himself the clerical drudgery. The partnership between Pons and Schmucke produced one brilliant result. Schmucke being a German, harmony was his strong point; he looked over the instrumentation of Pons' compositions, and Pons provided the airs. Here and there an amateur among the audience admired the new pieces of music which served as accompaniment to two or three great successes, but they attributed the improvement vaguely to "progress." No one cared to know the composer's name; like occupants of the baignoires, lost to view of the house, to gain a view of the stage, Pons and Schmucke eclipsed themselves by their success. In Paris (especially since the Revolution of July) no one can hope to succeed unless he will push his way quibuscumque viis and with all his might through a formidable host of competitors; but for this feat a man needs thews and sinews, and our two friends, be it remembered, had that affection of the heart which cripples all ambitious effort.

Pons, as a rule, only went to his theatre towards eight o'clock, when the piece in favor came on, and overtures and accompaniments needed the strict ruling of the baton; most minor theatres are lax in such matters, and Pons felt the more at ease because he himself had been by no means grasping in all his dealings with the management; and Schmucke, if need be, could take his place. Time went by, and Schmucke became an institution in the orchestra; the Illustrious Gaudissart said nothing, but he was well aware of the value of Pons' collaborator. He was obliged to include a pianoforte in the orchestra (following the example of the leading theatres); the instrument was placed beside the conductor's chair, and Schmucke played without increase of salary—a volunteer supernumerary. As Schmucke's character, his utter lack of ambition or pretence became known, the orchestra recognized him as one of themselves; and as time went on, he was intrusted with the often needed miscellaneous musical instruments which form no part of the regular band of a boulevard theatre. For a very small addition to his stipend, Schmucke played the viola d'amore, hautboy, violoncello, and harp, as well as the piano, the castanets for thecachucha, the bells, saxhorn, and the like. If the Germans cannot draw harmony from the mighty instruments of Liberty, yet to play all instruments of music comes to them by nature.

The two old artists were exceedingly popular at the theatre, and took its ways philosophically. They had put, as it were, scales over their eyes, lest they should see the offences that needs must come when a corps de ballet is blended with actors and actresses, one of the most trying combinations ever created by the laws of supply and demand for the torment of managers, authors, and composers alike. Every one esteemed Pons with his kindness and his modesty, his great self-respect and respect for others; for a pure and limpid life wins something like admiration from the worst nature in every social sphere, and in Paris a fair virtue meets with something of the success of a large diamond, so great a rarity it is. No actor, no dancer however brazen, would have indulged in the mildest practical joke at the expense of either Pons or Schmucke. Pons very occasionally put in an appearance in the foyer; but all that Schmucke knew of the theatre was the underground passage from the street door to the orchestra. Sometimes, however, during an interval, the good German would venture to make a survey of the house and ask a few questions of the first flute, a young fellow from Strasbourg, who came of a German family at Kehl. Gradually under the flute's tuition Schmucke's childlike imagination acquired a certain amount of knowledge of the world; he could believe in the existence of that fabulous creature the lorette, the possibility of "marriages at the Thirteenth Arrondissement," the vagaries of the leading lady, and the contraband traffic carried on by box-openers. In his eyes the more harmless forms of vice were the lowest depths of Babylonish iniquity; he did not believe the stories, he smiled at them for grotesque inventions. The ingenious reader can see that Pons and Schmucke were exploited, to use a word much in fashion; but what they lost in money they gained in consideration and kindly treatment.

It was after the success of the ballet with which a run of success began for the Gaudissart Company that the management presented Pons with a piece of plate—a group of figures attributed to Benvenuto Cellini. The alarming costliness of the gift caused talk in the green-room. It was a matter of twelve hundred francs! Pons, poor honest soul, was for returning the present, and Gaudissart had a world of trouble to persuade him to keep it.

"Ah!" said the manager afterwards, when he told his partner of the interview, "if we could only find actors up to that sample."

In their joint life, outwardly so quiet, there was the one disturbing element—the weakness to which Pons sacrificed, the insatiable craving to dine out. Whenever Schmucke happened to be at home while Pons was dressing for the evening, the good German would bewail this deplorable habit.

"Gif only he vas ony fatter vor it!" he many a time cried.

And Schmucke would dream of curing his friend of his degrading vice, for a true friend's instinct in all that belongs to the inner life is unerring as a dog's sense of smell; a friend knows by intuition the trouble in his friend's soul, and guesses at the cause and ponders it in his heart.

Pons, who always wore a diamond ring on the little finger of his right hand, an ornament permitted in the time of the Empire, but ridiculous to-day—Pons, who belonged to the "troubadour time," the sentimental periods of the first Empire, was too much a child of his age, too much of a Frenchman to wear the expression of divine serenity which softened Schmucke's hideous ugliness. From Pons' melancholy looks Schmucke knew that the profession of parasite was growing daily more difficult and painful. And, in fact, in that month of October 1844, the number of houses at which Pons dined was naturally much restricted; reduced to move round and round the family circle, he had used the word family in far too wide a sense, as will shortly be seen.

M. Camusot, the rich silk mercer of the Rue des Bourdonnais, had married Pons' first cousin, Mlle. Pons, only child and heiress of one of the well-known firm of Pons Brothers, court embroiderers. Pons' own father and mother retired from a firm founded before the Revolution of 1789, leaving their capital in the business until Mlle. Pons' father sold it in 1815 to M. Rivet. M. Camusot had since lost his wife and married again, and retired from business some ten years, and now in 1844 he was a member of the Board of Trade, a deputy, and what not. But the Camusot clan were friendly; and Pons, good man, still considered that he was some kind of cousin to the children of the second marriage, who were not relations, or even connected with him in any way.

The second Mme. Camusot being a Mlle. Cardot, Pons introduced himself as a relative into the tolerably numerous Cardot family, a second bourgeois tribe which, taken with its connections, formed quite as strong a clan as the Camusots; for Cardot the notary (brother of the second Mme. Camusot) had married a Mlle. Chiffreville; and the well-known family of Chiffreville, the leading firm of manufacturing chemists, was closely connected with the whole drug trade, of which M. Anselme Popinot was for many years the undisputed head, until the Revolution of July plunged him into the very centre of the dynastic movement, as everybody knows. So Pons, in the wake of the Camusots and Cardots, reached the Chiffrevilles, and thence the Popinots, always in the character of a cousin's cousin.

The above concise statement of Pons' relations with his entertainers explains how it came to pass that an old musician was received in 1844 as one of the family in the houses of four distinguished persons—to wit, M. le Comte Popinot, peer of France, and twice in office; M. Cardot, retired notary, mayor and deputy of an arrondissement in Paris; M. Camusot senior, a member of the Board of Trade and the Municipal Chamber and a peerage; and lastly, M. Camusot de Marville, Camusot's son by his first marriage, and Pons' one genuine relation, albeit even he was a first cousin once removed.

This Camusot, President of a Chamber of the Court of Appeal in Paris, had taken the name of his estate at Marville to distinguish himself from his father and a younger half brother.

Cardot the retired notary had married his daughter to his successor, whose name was Berthier; and Pons, transferred as part of the connection, acquired a right to dine with the Berthiers "in the presence of a notary," as he put it.

This was the bourgeois empyrean which Pons called his "family," that upper world in which he so painfully reserved his right to a knife and fork.

Of all these houses, some ten in all, the one in which Pons ought to have met with the kindest reception should by rights have been his own cousin's; and, indeed, he paid most attention to President Camusot's family. But, alas! Mme. Camusot de Marville, daughter of the Sieur Thirion, usher of the cabinet to Louis XVIII and Charles X, had never taken very kindly to her husband's first cousin, once removed. Pons had tried to soften this formidable relative; he wasted his time; for in spite of the pianoforte lessons which he gave gratuitously to Mlle. Camusot, a young woman with hair somewhat inclined to red, it was impossible to make a musician of her. And now, at this very moment, as he walked with that precious object in his hand, Pons was bound for the President's house, where he always felt as if he were at the Tuileries itself, so heavily did the solemn green curtains, the carmelite-brown hangings, thick piled carpets, heavy furniture, and general atmosphere of magisterial severity oppress his soul. Strange as it may seem, he felt more at home in the Hotel Popinot, Rue Basse-du-Rempart, probably because it was full of works of art; for the master of the house, since he entered public life, had acquired a mania for collecting beautiful things, by way of contrast no doubt, for a politician is obliged to pay for secret services of the ugliest kind.





VII


President de Marville lived in the Rue de Hanovre, in a house which his wife had bought ten years previously, on the death of her parents, for the Sieur and Dame Thirion left their daughter about a hundred and fifty thousand francs, the savings of a lifetime. With its north aspect, the house looks gloomy enough seen from the street, but the back looks towards the south over the courtyard, with a rather pretty garden beyond it. As the President occupied the whole of the first floor, once the abode of a great financier of the time of Louis XV, and the second was let to a wealthy old lady, the house wore a look of dignified repose befitting a magistrate's residence. President Camusot had invested all that he inherited from his mother, together with the savings of twenty years, in the purchase of the splendid Marville estate; a chateau (as fine a relic of the past as you will find to-day in Normandy) standing in a hundred acres of park land, and a fine dependent farm, nominally bringing in twelve thousand francs per annum, though, as it cost the President at least a thousand crowns to keep up a state almost princely in our days, his yearly revenue, "all told," as the saying is, was a bare nine thousand francs. With this and his salary, the President's income amounted to about twenty thousand francs; but though to all appearance a wealthy man, especially as one-half of his father's property would one day revert to him as the only child of the first marriage, he was obliged to live in Paris as befitted his official position, and M. and Mme. de Marville spent almost the whole of their incomes. Indeed, before the year 1834 they felt pinched.

This family schedule sufficiently explains why Mlle. de Marville, aged three-and-twenty, was still unwed, in spite of a hundred thousand francs of dowry and tempting prospects, frequently, skilfully, but so far vainly, held out. For the past five years Pons had listened to Mme. la Presidente's lamentations as she beheld one young lawyer after another led to the altar, while all the newly appointed judges at the Tribunal were fathers of families already; and she, all this time, had displayed Mlle. de Marville's brilliant expectations before the undazzled eyes of young Vicomte Popinot, eldest son of the great man of the drug trade, he of whom it was said by the envious tongues of the neighborhood of the Rue des Lombards, that the Revolution of July had been brought about at least as much for his particular benefit as for the sake of the Orleans branch.

Arrived at the corner of the Rue de Choiseul and the Rue de Hanovre, Pons suffered from the inexplicable emotions which torment clear consciences; for a panic terror such as the worst of scoundrels might feel at sight of a policeman, an agony caused solely by a doubt as to Mme. de Marville's probable reception of him. That grain of sand, grating continually on the fibres of his heart, so far from losing its angles, grew more and more jagged, and the family in the Rue de Hanovre always sharpened the edges. Indeed, their unceremonious treatment and Pons' depreciation in value among them had affected the servants; and while they did not exactly fail in respect, they looked on the poor relation as a kind of beggar.

Pons' arch-enemy in the house was the ladies'-maid, a thin and wizened spinster, Madeleine Vivet by name. This Madeleine, in spite of, nay, perhaps on the strength of, a pimpled complexion and a viper-like length of spine, had made up her mind that some day she would be Mme. Pons. But in vain she dangled twenty thousand francs of savings before the old bachelor's eyes; Pons had declined happiness accompanied by so many pimples. From that time forth the Dido of the ante-chamber, who fain had called her master and mistress "cousin," wreaked her spite in petty ways upon the poor musician. She heard him on the stairs, and cried audibly, "Oh! here comes the sponger!" She stinted him of wine when she waited at dinner in the footman's absence; she filled the water-glass to the brim, to give him the difficult task of lifting it without spilling a drop; or she would pass the old man over altogether, till the mistress of the house would remind her (and in what a tone!—it brought the color to the poor cousin's face); or she would spill the gravy over his clothes. In short, she waged petty war after the manner of a petty nature, knowing that she could annoy an unfortunate superior with impunity.





VIII


Madeleine Vivet was Mme. de Marville's maid and housekeeper. She had lived with M. and Mme. Camusot de Marville since their marriage; she had shared the early struggles in the provinces when M. Camusot was a judge at Alencon; she had helped them to exist when M. Camusot, President of the Tribunal of Mantes, came to Paris, in 1828, to be an examining magistrate. She was, therefore, too much one of the family not to wish, for reasons of her own, to revenge herself upon them. Beneath her desire to pay a trick upon her haughty and ambitious mistress, and to call her master her cousin, there surely lurked a long-stifled hatred, built up like an avalanche, upon the pebble of some past grievance.

"Here comes your M. Pons, madame, still wearing that spencer of his!" Madeleine came to tell the Presidente. "He really might tell me how he manages to make it look the same for five-and-twenty years together."

Mme. Camusot de Marville, hearing a man's footstep in the little drawing-room between the large drawing-room and her bedroom, looked at her daughter and shrugged her shoulders.

"You always make these announcements so cleverly that you leave me no time to think, Madeleine."

"Jean is out, madame, I was all alone; M. Pons rang the bell, I opened the door; and as he is almost one of the family, I could not prevent him from coming after me. There he is, taking off his spencer."

"Poor little puss!" said the Presidente, addressing her daughter, "we are caught. We shall have to dine at home now.—Let us see," she added, seeing that the "dear puss" wore a piteous face; "must we get rid of him for good?"

"Oh! poor man!" cried Mlle. Camusot, "deprive him of one of his dinners?"

Somebody coughed significantly in the next room by way of warning that he could hear.

"Very well, let him come in!" said Mme. Camusot, looking at Madeleine with another shrug.

"You are here so early, cousin, that you have come in upon us just as mother was about to dress," said Cecile Camusot in a coaxing tone.

But Cousin Pons had caught sight of the Presidente's shrug, and felt so cruelly hurt that he could not find a compliment, and contented himself with the profound remark, "You are always charming, my little cousin."

Then, turning to the mother, he continued with a bow:

"You will not take it amiss, I think, if I have come a little earlier than usual, dear cousin; I have brought something for you; you once did me the pleasure of asking me for it."

Poor Pons! Every time he addressed the President, the President's wife, or Cecile as "cousin," he gave them excruciating annoyance. As he spoke, he draw a long, narrow cherry-wood box, marvelously carved, from his coat-pocket.

"Oh, did I?—I had forgotten," the lady answered drily.

It was a heartless speech, was it not? Did not those few words deny all merit to the pains taken for her by the cousin whose one offence lay in the fact that he was a poor relation?

"But it is very kind of you, cousin," she added. "How much to I owe you for this little trifle?"

Pons quivered inwardly at the question. He had meant the trinket as a return for his dinners.

"I thought that you would permit me to offer it you——" he faltered out.

"What?" said Mme. Camusot. "Oh! but there need be no ceremony between us; we know each other well enough to wash our linen among ourselves. I know very well that you are not rich enough to give more than you get. And to go no further, it is quite enough that you should have spent a good deal of time in running among the dealers—"

"If you were asked to pay the full price of the fan, my dear cousin, you would not care to have it," answered poor Pons, hurt and insulted; "it is one of Watteau's masterpieces, painted on both sides; but you may be quite easy, cousin, I did not give one-hundredth part of its value as a work of art."

To tell a rich man that he is poor! you might as well tell the Archbishop of Granada that his homilies show signs of senility. Mme. la Presidente, proud of her husband's position, of the estate of Marville, and her invitations to court balls, was keenly susceptible on this point; and what was worse, the remark came from a poverty-stricken musician to whom she had been charitable.

"Then the people of whom you buy things of this kind are very stupid, are they?" she asked quickly.

"Stupid dealers are unknown in Paris," Pons answered almost drily.

"Then you must be very clever," put in Cecile by way of calming the dispute.

"Clever enough to know a Lancret, a Watteau, a Pater, or Greuze when I see it, little cousin; but anxious, most of all, to please your dear mamma."

Mme. de Marville, ignorant and vain, was unwilling to appear to receive the slightest trifle from the parasite; and here her ignorance served her admirably, she did not even know the name of Watteau. And, on the other hand, if anything can measure the extent of the collector's passion, which, in truth, is one of the most deeply seated of all passions, rivaling the very vanity of the author—if anything can give an idea of the lengths to which a collector will go, it is the audacity which Pons displayed on this occasion, as he held his own against his lady cousin for the first time in twenty years. He was amazed at his own boldness. He made Cecile see the beauties of the delicate carving on the sticks of this wonder, and as he talked to her his face grew serene and gentle again. But without some sketch of the Presidente, it is impossible fully to understand the perturbation of heart from which Pons suffered.

Mme. de Marville had been short and fair, plump and fresh; at forty-six she was as short as ever, but she looked dried up. An arched forehead and thin lips, that had been softly colored once, lent a soured look to a face naturally disdainful, and now grown hard and unpleasant with a long course of absolute domestic rule. Time had deepened her fair hair to a harsh chestnut hue; the pride of office, intensified by suppressed envy, looked out of eyes that had lost none of their brightness nor their satirical expression. As a matter of fact, Mme. Camusot de Marville felt almost poor in the society of self-made wealthy bourgeois with whom Pons dined. She could not forgive the rich retail druggist, ex-president of the Commercial Court, for his successive elevations as deputy, member of the Government, count and peer of France. She could not forgive her father-in-law for putting himself forward instead of his eldest son as deputy of his arrondissement after Popinot's promotion to the peerage. After eighteen years of services in Paris, she was still waiting for the post of Councillor of the Court of Cassation for her husband. It was Camusot's own incompetence, well known at the Law Courts, which excluded him from the Council. The Home Secretary of 1844 even regretted Camusot's nomination to the presidency of the Court of Indictments in 1834, though, thanks to his past experience as an examining magistrate, he made himself useful in drafting decrees.





IX


These disappointments had told upon Mme. de Marville, who, moreover, had formed a tolerably correct estimate of her husband. A temper naturally shrewish was soured till she grew positively terrible. She was not old, but she had aged; she deliberately set herself to extort by fear all that the world was inclined to refuse her, and was harsh and rasping as a file. Caustic to excess she had few friends among women; she surrounded herself with prim, elderly matrons of her own stamp, who lent each other mutual support, and people stood in awe of her. As for poor Pons, his relations with this fiend in petticoats were very much those of a schoolboy with the master whose one idea of communication is the ferule. The Presidente had no idea of the value of the gift. She was puzzled by her cousin's sudden access of audacity.

"Then, where did you find this?" inquired Cecile, as she looked closely at the trinket.

"In the Rue de Lappe. A dealer in second-hand furniture there had just brought it back with him from a chateau that is being pulled down near Dreux, Aulnay. Mme. de Pompadour used to spend part of her time there before she built Menars. Some of the most splendid wood-carving ever known has been saved from destruction; Lienard (our most famous living wood-carver) had kept a couple of oval frames for models, as the ne plus ultra of the art, so fine it is.—There were treasures in that place. My man found the fan in the drawer of an inlaid what-not, which I should certainly have bought if I were collecting things of the kind, but it is quite out of the question—a single piece of Riesener's furniture is worth three or four thousand francs! People here in Paris are just beginning to find out that the famous French and German marquetry workers of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries composed perfect pictures in wood. It is a collector's business to be ahead of the fashion. Why, in five years'time, the Frankenthal ware, which I have been collecting these twenty years, will fetch twice the price of Sevres pata tendre."

"What is Frankenthal ware?" asked Cecile.

"That is the name of the porcelain made by the Elector of the Palatinate; it dates further back than our manufactory at Sevres; just as the famous gardens at Heidelberg, laid waste by Turenne, had the bad luck to exist before the garden of Versailles. Sevres copied Frankenthal to a large extent.—In justice to the Germans, it must be said that they have done admirable work in Saxony and in the Palatinate."

Mother and daughter looked at one another as if Pons were speaking Chinese. No one can imagine how ignorant and exclusive Parisians are; they only learn what they are taught, and that only when they choose.

"And how do you know the Frankenthal ware when you see it?"

"Eh! by the mark!" cried Pons with enthusiasm. "There is a mark on every one of those exquisite masterpieces. Frankenthal ware is marked with a C and T (for Charles Théodore) interlaced and crowned. On old Dresden china there are two crossed swords and the number of the order in gilt figures. Vincennes bears a hunting-horn; Vienna, a V closed and barred. You can tell Berlin by the two bars, Mayence by the wheel, and Sevres by the two crossed L's. The queen's porcelain is marked A for Antoinette, with a royal crown above it. In the eighteenth century, all the crowned heads of Europe had rival porcelain factories, and workmen were kidnaped. Watteau designed services for the Dresden factory; they fetch frantic prices at the present day. One has to know what one is about with them too, for they are turning out imitations now at Dresden. Wonderful things they used to make; they will never make the like again—"

"Oh! pshaw!"

"No, cousin. Some inlaid work and some kinds of porcelain will never be made again, just as there will never be another Raphael, nor Titian, nor Rembrandt, nor Van Eyck, nor Cranach.... Well, now! there are the Chinese; they are very ingenious, very clever; they make modern copies of their 'grand mandarin' porcelain, as it is called. But a pair of vases of genuine 'grand mandarin' vases of the largest size, are worth, six, eight, and ten thousand francs, while you can buy the modern replicas for a couple of hundred!"

"You are joking."

"You are astonished at the prices, but that is nothing, cousin. A dinner service of Sevres pate tendre (and pate tendre is not porcelain)—a complete dinner service of Sevrespate tendre for twelve persons is not merely worth a hundred thousand francs, but that is the price charged on the invoice. Such a dinner-service cost fifteen thousand francs at Sevres in 1750; I have seen the original invoices."

"But let us go back to this fan," said Cecile. Evidently in her opinion the trinket was an old-fashioned thing.

"You can understand that as soon as your dear mamma did me the honor of asking for a fan, I went round of all the curiosity shops in Paris, but I found nothing fine enough. I wanted nothing less than a masterpiece for the dear Presidente, and thought of giving her one that once belonged to Marie Antoinette, the most beautiful of all celebrated fans. But yesterday I was dazzled by this divine chef-d'oeuvre, which certainly must have been ordered by Louis XV himself. Do you ask how I came to look for fans in the Rue de Lappe, among an Auvergnat's stock of brass and iron and ormolu furniture? Well, I myself believe that there is an intelligence in works of art; they know art-lovers, they call to them—'Cht-tt!'"

Mme. de Marville shrugged her shoulders and looked at her daughter; Pons did not notice the rapid pantomime.

"I know all those sharpers," continued Pons, "so I asked him, 'Anything fresh to-day, Daddy Monistrol?'—(for he always lets me look over his lots before the big buyers come)—and at that he began to tell me how Lienard, that did such beautiful work for the Government in the Chapelle de Dreux, had been at the Aulnay sale and rescued the carved panels out of the clutches of the Paris dealers, while their heads were running on china and inlaid furniture.—'I did not do much myself,' he went on, 'but I may make my traveling expenses out of this,' and he showed me a what-not; a marvel! Boucher's designs executed in marquetry, and with such art!—One could have gone down on one's knees before it.—'Look, sir,' he said, 'I have just found this fan in a little drawer; it was locked, I had to force it open. You might tell me where I can sell it'—and with that he brings out this little carved cherry-wood box.—'See,' says he, 'it is the kind of Pompadour that looks like decorated Gothic.'—'Yes,' I told him, 'the box is pretty; the box might suit me; but as for the fan, Monistrol, I have no Mme. Pons to give the old trinket to, and they make very pretty new ones nowadays; you can buy miracles of painting on vellum cheaply enough. There are two thousand painters in Paris, you know.'—And I opened out the fan carelessly, keeping down my admiration, looked indifferently at those two exquisite little pictures, touched off with an ease fit to send you into raptures. I held Mme. de Pompadour's fan in my hand! Watteau had done his utmost for this.—'What do you want for the what-not?'—'Oh! a thousand francs; I have had a bid already.'—I offered him a price for the fan corresponding with the probable expenses of the journey. We looked each other in the eyes, and I saw that I had my man. I put the fan back into the box lest my Auvergnat should begin to look at it, and went into ecstasies over the box; indeed, it is a jewel.—'If I take it,' said I, 'it is for the sake of the box; the box tempts me. As for the what-not, you will get more than a thousand francs for that. Just see how the brass is wrought; it is a model. There is business in it.... It has never been copied; it is a unique specimen, made solely for Mme. de Pompadour'—and so on, till my man, all on fire for his what-not, forgets the fan, and lets me have it for a mere trifle, because I have pointed out the beauties of his piece of Riesener's furniture. So here it is; but it needs a great deal of experience to make such a bargain as that. It is a duel, eye to eye; and who has such eyes as a Jew or an Auvergnat?"

The old artist's wonderful pantomime, his vivid, eager way of telling the story of the triumph of his shrewdness over the dealer's ignorance, would have made a subject for a Dutch painter; but it was all thrown away upon the audience. Mother and daughter exchanged cold, contemptuous glances.—"What an oddity!" they seemed to say.

"So it amuses you?" remarked Mme. de Marville.

The question sent a cold chill through Pons; he felt a strong desire to slap the Presidente.

"Why, my dear cousin, that is the way to hunt down a work of art.You are face to face with antagonists that dispute the game with you. It is craft against craft! A work of art in the hands of a Norman, an Auvergnat, or a Jew, is like a princess guarded by magicians in a fairy tale."

"And how can you tell that this is by Wat—what do you call him?"

"Watteau, cousin. One of the greatest eighteenth century painters in France. Look! do you not see that it is his work?" (pointing to a pastoral scene, court-shepherd swains and shepherdesses dancing in a ring). "The movement! the life in it! the coloring! There it is—see!—painted with a stroke of the brush, as a writing-master makes a flourish with a pen. Not a trace of effort here! And, turn it over, look!—a ball in a drawing-room. Summer and Winter! And what ornaments! and how well preserved it is! The hinge-pin is gold, you see, and on cleaning it, I found a tiny ruby at either side."

"If it is so, cousin, I could not think of accepting such a valuable present from you. It would be better to lay up the money for yourself," said Mme. de Marville; but all the same, she asked no better than to keep the splendid fan.

"It is time that it should pass from the service of Vice into the hands of Virtue," said the good soul, recovering his assurance. "It has taken a century to work the miracle. No princess at Court, you may be sure, will have anything to compare with it; for, unfortunately, men will do more for a Pompadour than for a virtuous queen, such is human nature."

"Very well," Mme. de Marville said, laughing, "I will accept your present.—Cecile, my angel, go to Madeleine and see that dinner is worthy of your cousin."

Mme. de Marville wished to make matters even. Her request, made aloud, in defiance of all rules of good taste, sounded so much like an attempt to repay at once the balance due to the poor cousin, that Pons flushed red, like a girl found out in fault. The grain of sand was a little too large; for some moments he could only let it work in his heart. Cecile, a red-haired young woman, with a touch of pedantic affectation, combined her father's ponderous manner with a trace of her mother's hardness. She went and left poor Pons face to face with the terrible Presidente.

"How nice she is, my little Lili!" said the mother. She still called her Cecile by this baby name.

"Charming!" said Pons, twirling his thumbs.

"I cannot understand these times in which we live," broke out the Presidente. "What is the good of having a President of the Court of Appeal in Paris and a Commander of the Legion of Honor for your father, and for a grandfather the richest wholesale silk merchant in Paris, a deputy, and a millionaire that will be a peer of France some of these days?"

The President's zeal for the new Government had, in fact, recently been rewarded with a commander's ribbon—thanks to his friendship with Popinot, said the envious. Popinot himself, modest though he was, had, as has been seen, accepted the title of count, "for his son's sake," he told his numerous friends.

"Men look for nothing but money nowadays," said Cousin Pons. "No one thinks anything of you unless you are rich, and—"

"What would it have been if Heaven had spared my poor little Charles!—" cried the lady.

"Oh, with two children you would be poor," returned the cousin.

"It practically means the division of the property. But you need not trouble yourself, cousin; Cecile is sure to marry sooner or later. She is the most accomplished girl I know."

To such depths had Pons fallen by adapting himself to the company of his entertainers! In their houses he echoed their ideas, and said the obvious thing, after the manner of a chorus in a Greek play. He did not dare to give free play to the artist's originality, which had overflowed in bright repartee when he was young; he had effaced himself, till he had almost lost his individuality; and if the real Pons appeared, as he had done a moment ago, he was immediately repressed.

"But I myself was married with only twenty thousand francs for my portion—"

"In 1819, cousin. And it was you, a woman with a head on your shoulders, and the royal protection of Louis XVIII."

"Be still, my child is a perfect angel. She is clever, she has a warm heart, she will have a hundred thousand francs on her wedding day, to say nothing of the most brilliant expectations; and yet she stays on our hands," and so on and so on. For twenty minutes, Mme. de Marville talked on about herself and her Cecile, pitying herself after the manner of mothers in bondage to marriageable daughters. Pons had dined at the house every week for twenty years, and Camusot de Marville was the only cousin he had in the world; but he had yet to hear the first word spoken as to his own affairs—nobody cared to know how he lived. Here and elsewhere the poor cousin was a kind of sink down which his relatives poured domestic confidences. His discretion was well known; indeed, was he not bound over to silence when a single imprudent word would have shut the door of ten houses upon him? And he must combine his role of listener with a second part; he must applaud continually, smile on every one, accuse nobody, defend nobody; from his point of view, every one must be in the right. And so, in the house of his kinsman, Pons no longer counted as a man; he was a digestive apparatus. In the course of a long tirade, Mme. Camusot de Marville avowed with due circumspection that she was prepared to take almost any son-in-law with her eyes shut. She was even disposed to think that at eight-and-forty or so a man with twenty thousand francs a year was a good match.

"Cecile is in her twenty-third year. If it should fall out so unfor-tunately that she is not married before she is five or six-and-twenty, it will be extremely hard to marry her at all. When a girl reaches that age, people want to know why she has been so long on hand. We are a good deal talked about in our set. We have come to the end of all the ordinary excuses—'She is so young.—She is so fond of her father and mother that she doesn't like to leave them.—She is so happy at home.—She is hard to please, she would like a good name—' We are beginning to look silly; I feel that distinctly. And besides, Cecile is tired of waiting, poor child, she suffers—"

"In what way?" Pons was noodle enough to ask.

"Why, because it is humiliating to her to see all her girl friends married before her," replied the mother, with a duenna's air.

"But, cousin, has anything happened since the last time that I had the pleasure of dining here? Why do you think of men of eight-and-forty?" Pons inquired humbly.

"This has happened," returned the Presidente. "We were to have had an interview with a Court Councillor; his son is thirty years old and very well-to-do, and M. de Marville would have obtained a post in the audit-office for him and paid the money. The young man is a supernumerary there at present. And now they tell us that he has taken it into his head to rush off to Italy in the train of a duchess from the Bal Mabille.... It is nothing but a refusal in disguise. The fact is, the young man's mother is dead; he has an income of thirty thousand francs, and more to come at his father's death, and they don't care about the match for him. You have just come in in the middle of all this, dear cousin, so you must excuse our bad temper."

While Pons was casting about for the complimentary answer which invariably occurred to him too late when he was afraid of his host, Madeleine came in, handed a folded note to the Presidente, and waited for an answer. The note ran as follows:

DEAR MAMMA,—If we pretend that this note comes to you from papa at the Palais, and that he wants us both to dine with his friend because proposals have been renewed—then the cousin will go, and we can carry out our plan of going to the Popinots.

"Who brought the master's note?" the Presidente asked quickly.

"A lad from the Salle du Palais," the withered waiting woman unblushingly answered, and her mistress knew at once that Madeleine had woven the plot with Cecile, now at the end of her patience.

"Tell him that we will both be there at half-past five."





XI


Madeleine had no sooner left the room than the Presidente turned to Cousin Pons with that insincere friendliness which is about as grateful to a sensitive soul as a mixture of milk and vinegar to the palate of an epicure.

"Dinner is ordered, dear cousin; you must dine without us; my husband has just sent word from the court that the question of the marriage has been reopened, and we are to dine with the Councillor. We need not stand on ceremony at all. Do just as if you were at home. I have no secrets from you; I am perfectly open with you, as you see. I am sure you would not wish to break off the little darling's marriage."

"I, cousin? On the contrary, I should like to find some one for her; but in my circle—"

"Oh, that is not at all likely," said the Presidente, cutting him short insolently. "Then you will stay, will you not? Cecile will keep you company while I dress.

"Oh! I can dine somewhere else, cousin."

Cruelly hurt though he was by her way of casting up his poverty to him, the prospect of being left alone with the servants was even more alarming.

"But why should you? Dinner is ready; you may just as well have it; if you do not, the servants will eat it." At that atrocious speech Pons started up as if he had received a shock from a galvanic battery, bowed stiffly to the lady, and went to find his spencer. Now, it so happened that the door of Cecile's bedroom, beyond the little drawing-room, stood open, and looking into the mirror, he caught sight of the girl shaking with laughter as she gesticulated and made signs to her mother. The old artist understood beyond a doubt that he had been the victim of some cowardly hoax. Pons went slowly down the stairs; he could not keep back the tears. He understood that he had been turned out of the house, but why and wherefore he did not know.

"I am growing too old," he told himself. "The world has a horror of old age and poverty—two ugly things. After this I will not go anywhere unless I am asked."

Heroic resolve!

Downstairs the great gate was shut, as it usually is in houses occupied by the proprietor; the kitchen stood exactly opposite the porter's lodge, and the door was open. Pons was obliged to listen while Madeleine told the servants the whole story amid the laughter of the servants. She had not expected him to leave so soon. The footman loudly applauded a joke at the expense of a visitor who was always coming to the house and never gave you more than three francs at the year's end.

"Yes," put in the cook; "but if he cuts up rough and does not come back, there will be three francs the less for some of us on New Year's day."

"Eh! How is he to know?" retorted the footman.

"Pooh!" said Madeleine, "a little sooner or a little later—what difference does it make? The people at the other houses where he dines are so tired of him that they are going to turn him out."

"The gate, if you please!" Madeleine had scarcely uttered the words when they heard the old musician's call to the porter. It sounded like a cry of pain. There was a sudden silence in the kitchen.

"He heard!" the footman said.

"Well, and if he did, so much the worser, or rather so much the better," retorted Madeleine. "He is an arrant skinflint."

Poor Pons had lost none of the talk in the kitchen; he heard it all, even to the last word. He made his way home along the boulevards, in the same state, physical and mental, as an old woman after a desperate struggle with burglars. As he went he talked to himself in quick spasmodic jerks; his honor had been wounded, and the pain of it drove him on as a gust of wind whirls away a straw. He found himself at last in the Boulevard du Temple; how he had come thither he could not tell. It was five o'clock, and, strange to say, he had completely lost his appetite.

But if the reader is to understand the revolution which Pons' un-expected return at that hour was to work in the Rue de Normandie, the promised biography of Mme. Cibot must be given in this place.





XII


Any one passing along the Rue de Normandie might be pardoned for thinking that he was in some small provincial town. Grass runs to seed in the street, everybody knows everybody else, and the sight of a stranger is an event. The houses date back to the reign of Henry IV, when there was a scheme afoot for a quarter in which every street was to be named after a French province, and all should converge in a handsome square to which La France should stand godmother. The Quartier de l'Europe was a revival of the same idea; history repeats itself everywhere in the world, and even in the world of speculation. The house in which the two musicians used to live is an old mansion with a courtyard in front and a garden at the back; but the front part of the house which gives upon the street is comparatively modern, built during the eighteenth century when the Marais was a fashionable quarter. The friends lived at the back, on the second floor of the old part of the house. The whole building belongs to M. Pillerault, an old man of eighty, who left matters very much in the hands of M. and Mme. Cibot, his porters for the past twenty-six years. Now, as a porter cannot live by his lodge alone, the aforesaid Cibot had other means of gaining a livelihood; and supplemented his five per cent on the rental and his faggot from every cartload of wood by his own earnings as a tailor. In time Cibot ceased to work for the master tailors; he made a connection among the little trades-people of the quarter, and enjoyed a monopoly of the repairs, renovations, and fine drawing of all the coats and trousers in three adjacent streets. The lodge was spacious and wholesome, and boasted a second room; wherefore the Cibot couple were looked upon as among the luckiest porters in the arrondissement.

Cibot, small and stunted, with a complexion almost olive-colored by reason of sitting day in day out in Turk-fashion on a table level with the barred window, made about twelve or fourteen francs a week. He worked still, though he was fifty-eight years old, but fifty-eight is the porter's golden age; he is used to his lodge, he and his room fit each other like the shell and the oyster, and "he is known in the neighborhood."

Mme. Cibot, sometime opener of oysters at the Cadran Bleu, after all the adventures which come unsought to the belle of an oyster-bar, left her post for love of Cibot at the age of twenty-eight. The beauty of a woman of the people is short-lived, especially if she is planted espalier fashion at a restaurant door. Her features are hardened by puffs of hot air from the kitchen; the color of the heeltaps of customers' bottles, finished in the company of the waiters, gradually filters into her complexion—no beauty is full blown so soon as the beauty of an oyster-opener. Luckily for Mme. Cibot, lawful wedlock and a portress' life were offered to her just in time; while she still preserved a comeliness of a masculine order slandered by rivals of the Rue de Normandie, who called her "a great blowsy thing," Mme. Cibot might have sat as a model to Rubens. Those flesh tints reminded you of the appetizing sheen on a pat of Isigny butter; but plump as she was, no woman went about her work with more agility. Mme. Cibot had attained the time of life when women of her stamp are obliged to shave—which is as much as to say that she had reached the age of forty-eight. A porter's wife with a moustache is one of the best possible guarantees of respectability and security that a landlord can have. If Delacroix could have seen Mme. Cibot leaning proudly on her broom handle, he would assuredly have painted her as Bellona.

Strange as it may seem, the circumstances of the Cibots, man and wife (in the style of an indictment), were one day to affect the lives of the two friends; wherefore the chronicler, as in duty bound, must give some particulars as to the Cibots' lodge. The house brought in about eight thousand francs for there were three complete sets of apartments—back and front, on the side nearest the Rue de Normandie, as well as the three floors in the older mansion between the courtyard and the garden, and a shop kept by a marine store-dealer named Remonencq, which fronted on the street. During the past few months this Remonencq had begun to deal in old curiosities, and knew the value of Pons' collection so well that he took off his hat whenever the musician came in or went out. A sou in the livre on eight thousand francs therefore brought in about four hundred francs to the Cibots. They had no rent to pay and no expenses for firing; Cibot's earnings amounted on an average to seven or eight hundred francs, add tips at New Year, and the pair had altogether in income of sixteen hundred francs, every penny of which they spent, for the Cibots lived and fared better than working people usually do. "One can only live once," La Cibot used to say. She was born during the Revolution, you see, and had never learned her Catechism.

The husband of this portress with the unblenching tawny eyes was an object of envy to the whole fraternity, for La Cibot had not forgotten the knowledge of cookery picked up at the Cadran Bleu. So it had come to pass that the Cibots had passed the prime of life, and saw themselves on the threshold of old age without a hundred francs put by for the future. Well clad and well fed, they enjoyed among the neighbors, it is true, the respect due to twenty-six years of strict honesty; for if they had nothing of their own, they "hadn't nothing belonging to nobody else," according to La Cibot, who was a prodigal of negatives. "There wasn't never such a love of a man," she would say to her husband. Do you ask why? You might as well ask the reason of her indifference in matters of religion. Both of them were proud of a life lived in open day, of the esteem in which they were held for six or seven streets round about, and of the autocratic rule permitted to them by the proprietor ("perprietor," they called him); but in private they groaned because they had no money lying at interest. Cibot complained of pains in his hands and legs, and his wife would lament that her poor, dear Cibot should be forced to work at his age; and, indeed, the day is not far distant when a porter after thirty years of such a life will cry shame upon the injustice of the Government and clamor for the ribbon of the Legion of Honor. Every time that the gossip of the quarter brought news of such and such a servant-maid, left an annuity of three or four hundred francs after eight or ten years of service, the porters' lodges would resound with complaints, which may give some idea of the consuming jealousies in the lowest walks of life in Paris.

"Oh, indeed! It will never happen to the like of us to have our names mentioned in a will! We have no luck, but we do more than servants, for all that. We fill a place of trust; we give receipts, we are on the lookout for squalls, and yet we are treated like dogs, neither more nor less, and that's the truth!"

"Some find fortune and some miss fortune," said Cibot, coming in with a coat.

"If I had left Cibot here in his lodge and taken a place as cook, we should have our thirty thousand francs out at interest," cried Mme. Cibot, standing chatting with a neighbor, her hands on her prominent hips. "But I didn't understand how to get on in life; housed inside of a snug lodge and firing found and want for nothing, but that is all."





XIII


In 1836, when the friends took up their abode on the third floor, they brought about a sort of revolution in the Cibot household. It befell on this wise. Schmucke, like his friend Pons, usually arranged that the porter or the porter's wife should undertake the cares of housekeeping; and being both of one mind on this point when they came to live in the Rue de Normandie, Mme. Cibot became their housekeeper at the rate of twenty-five francs per month—twelve francs fifty centimes for each of them. Before the year was out, the emeritus portress reigned in the establishment of the two old bachelors, as she reigned everywhere in the house belonging to M. Pillerault, great uncle of Mme. le Comtesse Popinot. Their business was her business; she called them "my gentlemen." And at last, finding the pair of nutcrackers as mild as lambs, easy to live with, and by no means suspicious—perfect children, in fact—her heart, the heart of a woman of the people, prompted her to protect, adore, and serve them with such thorough devotion, that she read them a lecture now and again, and saved them from the impositions which swell the cost of living in Paris. For twenty-five francs a month, the two old bachelors inadvertently acquired a mother. As they became aware of Mme. Cibot's full value, they gave her outspoken praises, and thanks, and little presents which strengthened the bonds of the domestic alliance. Mme. Cibot a thousand times preferred appreciation to money payments; it is a well-known fact that the sense that one is appreciated makes up for a deficiency in wages. And Cibot did all that he could for his wife's two gentlemen, and ran errands and did repairs at half-price for them.

The second year brought a new element into the friendship between the lodge and the third floor, and Schmucke concluded a bargain which satisfied his indolence and desire for a life without cares. For thirty sous per day, or forty-five francs per month, Mme. Cibot undertook to provide Schmucke with breakfast and dinner; and Pons, finding his friend's breakfast very much to his mind, concluded a separate treaty for that meal only at the rate of eighteen francs. This arrangement, which added nearly ninety francs every month to the takings of the porter and his wife, made two inviolable beings of the lodgers; they became angels, cherubs, divinities. It is very doubtful whether the King of the French, who is supposed to understand economy, is as well served as the pair of nutcrackers used to be in those days. For them the milk issued pure from the can; they enjoyed a free perusal of all the morning papers taken by other lodgers, later risers, who were told, if need be, that the newspapers had not come yet. Mme. Cibot, moreover, kept their clothes, their rooms, and the landing as clean as a Flemish interior. As for Schmucke, he enjoyed unhoped-for happiness; Mme. Cibot had made life easy for him; he paid her about six francs a month, and she took charge of his linen, washing, and mending. Altogether, his expenses amounted to sixty-six francs per month (for he spent fifteen francs on tobacco), and sixty-six francs multiplied by twelve produces the sum total of seven hundred and ninety-two francs. Add two hundred and twenty francs for rent, rates, and taxes, and you have a thousand and twelve francs. Cibot was Schmucke's tailor; his clothes cost him on average a hundred and fifty francs, which further swells the total to the sum of twelve hundred. On twelve hundred francs per annum this profound philosopher lived. How many people in Europe, whose one thought it is to come to Paris and live there, will be agreeably surprised to learn that you may exist in comfort upon an income of twelve hundred francs in the Rue de Normandie in the Marais, under the wing of a Mme. Cibot.

Mme. Cibot, to resume the story, was amazed beyond expression to see Pons, good man, return at five o'clock in the evening. Such a thing had never happened before; and not only so, but "her gentleman" had given her no greeting—had not so much as seen her!

"Well, well, Cibot," said she to her spouse, "M. Pons has come in for a million, or gone out of his mind!"

"That is how it looks to me," said Cibot, dropping the coat-sleeve in which he was making a "dart," in tailor's language.





XIV


The savory odor of a stew pervaded the whole courtyard, as Pons returned mechanically home. Mme. Cibot was dishing up Schmucke's dinner, which consisted of scraps of boiled beef from a little cook-shop not above doing a little trade of this kind. These morsels were fricasseed in brown butter, with thin slices of onion, until the meat and vegetables had absorbed the gravy and this true porter's dish was browned to the right degree. With that fricassee, prepared with loving care for Cibot and Schmucke, and accompanied by a bottle of beer and a piece of cheese, the old German music-master was quite content. Not King Solomon in all his glory, be sure, could dine better than Schmucke. A dish of boiled beef fricasseed with onions, scraps of saute chicken, or beef and parsley, or venison, or fish served with a sauce of La Cibot's own invention (a sauce with which a mother might unsuspectingly eat her child),—such was Schmucke's ordinary, varying with the quantity and quality of the remnants of food supplied by boulevard restaurants to the cook-shop in the Rue Boucherat. Schmucke took everything that "goot Montame Zipod" gave him, and was content, and so from day to day "goot Montame Zipod" cut down the cost of his dinner, until it could be served for twenty sous.

"It won't be long afore I find out what is the matter with him, poor dear," said Mme. Cibot to her husband, "for here is M. Schmucke's dinner all ready for him."

As she spoke she covered the deep earthenware dish with a plate; and, notwithstanding her age, she climbed the stair and reached the door before Schmucke opened it to Pons.

"Vat is de matter mit you, mein goot friend?" asked the German, scared by the expression of Pons' face.

"I will tell you all about it; but I have come home to have dinner with you—"

"Tinner! tinner!" cried Schmucke in ecstasy; "but it is impossible!" the old German added, as he thought of his friend's gastronomical tastes; and at that very moment he caught sight of Mme. Cibot listening to the conversation, as she had a right to do as his lawful housewife. Struck with one of those happy inspirations which only enlighten a friend's heart, he marched up to the portress and drew her out to the stairhead.

"Montame Zipod," he said, "der goot Pons is fond of goot dings; shoost go rount to der Catran Pleu und order a dainty liddle tinner, mit anjovies und maggaroni. Ein tinner for Lugullus, in vact."

"What is that?" inquired La Cibot.

"Oh! ah!" returned Schmucke, "it is veal a la pourcheoise (bourgeoise, he meant), a nice fisch, ein pottle off Porteaux, und nice dings, der fery best dey haf, like groquettes of rice und shmoked pacon! Bay for it, und say nodings; I vill gif you back de monny to-morrow morning."

Back went Schmucke, radiant and rubbing his hands; but his expression slowly changed to a look of bewildered astonishment as he heard Pons' story of the troubles that had but just now overwhelmed him in a moment. He tried to comfort Pons by giving him a sketch of the world from his own point of view. Paris, in his opinion, was a perpetual hurly-burly, the men and women in it were whirled away by a tempestuous waltz; it was no use expecting anything of the world, which only looked at the outsides of things, "und not at der inderior." For the hundredth time he related how that the only three pupils for whom he had really cared, for whom he was ready to die, the three who had been fond of him, and even allowed him a little pension of nine hundred francs, each contributing three hundred to the amount—his favorite pupils had quite forgotten to come to see him; and so swift was the current of Parisian life which swept them away, that if he called at their houses, he had not succeeded in seeing them once in three years—(it is a fact, however, that Schmucke had always thought fit to call on these great ladies at ten o'clock in the morning!)—still, his pension was paid quarterly through the medium of solicitors.

"Und yet, dey are hearts of gold," he concluded. "Dey are my liddle Saint Cecilias, sharming vimmen, Montame de Bordentuere, Montame de Fantenesse, und Montame du Dilet. Gif I see dem at all, it is at die Jambs Elusees, und dey do not see me... yet dey are ver' fond of me, und I might go to dine mit dem, und dey vould be ver' bleased to see me; und I might go to deir country-houses, but I vould much rader be mit mine friend Bons, because I kann see him venefer I like, und efery tay."

Pons took Schmucke's hand and grasped it between his own. All that was passing in his inmost soul was communicated in that tight pressure. And so for awhile the friends sat like two lovers, meeting at last after a long absence.

"Tine here, efery tay!" broke out Schmucke, inwardly blessing Mme. de Marville for her hardness of heart. "Look here! Ve shall go a prick-a-pracking togeders, und der teufel shall nefer show his tail here."

"Ve shall go prick-a-pracking togeders!" for the full comprehension of those truly heroic words, it must be confessed that Schmucke's ignorance of bric-a-brac was something of the densest. It required all the strength of his friendship to keep him from doing heedless damage in the sitting-room and study which did duty as a museum for Pons. Schmucke, wholly absorbed in music, a composer for love of his art, took about as much interest in his friend's little trifles as a fish might take in a flower-show at the Luxembourg, supposing that it had received a ticket of admission. A certain awe which he certainly felt for the marvels was simply a reflection of the respect which Pons showed his treasures when he dusted them. To Pons' exclamations of admiration, he was wont to reply with a "Yes, it is ver' bretty," as a mother answers baby-gestures with meaningless baby-talk. Seven times since the friends had lived together, Pons had exchanged a good clock for a better one, till at last he possessed a timepiece in Boule's first and best manner, for Boule had two manners, as Raphael had three. In the first he combined ebony and copper; in the second—contrary to his convictions—he sacrificed to tortoise-shell inlaid work. In spite of Pons' learned dissertations, Schmucke never could see the slightest difference between the magnificent clock in Boule's first manner and its six predecessors; but, for Pons' sake, Schmucke was even more careful among the "chimcracks" than Pons himself. So it should not be surprising that Schmucke's sublime words comforted Pons in his despair; for "Ve shall go prick-a-pracking togeders," meant, being interpreted, "I will put money into bric-a-brac, if you will only dine here."

"Dinner is ready," Mme. Cibot announced, with astonishing self-possession.

It is not difficult to imagine Pons' surprise when he saw and relished the dinner due to Schmucke's friendship. Sensations of this kind, that came so rarely in a lifetime, are never the outcome of the constant, close relationship by which friend daily says to friend, "You are a second self to me;" for this, too, becomes a matter of use and wont. It is only by contact with the barbarism of the world without that the happiness of that intimate life is revealed to us as a sudden glad surprise. It is the outer world which renews the bond between friend and friend, lover and lover, all their lives long, wherever two great souls are knit together by friendship or by love. Pons brushed away two big tears, Schmucke himself wiped his eyes; and though nothing was said, the two were closer friends than before. Little friendly nods and glances exchanged across the table were like balm to Pons, soothing the pain caused by the sand dropped in his heart by the President's wife. As for Schmucke, he rubbed his hands till they were sore; for a new idea had occurred to him, one of those great discoveries which cause a German no surprise, unless they sprout up suddenly in a Teuton brain frost-bound by the awe and reverence due to sovereign princes.

"Mine goot Bons?" began Schmucke.

"I can guess what you mean; you would like us both to dine together here, every day—"

"Gif only I vas rich enof to lif like dis efery tay—" began the good German in a melancholy voice. But here Mme. Cibot appeared upon the scene. Pons had given her an order for the theatre from time to time, and stood in consequence almost as high in her esteem and affection as her boarder Schmucke.

"Lord love you," said she, "for three francs and wine extra I can give you both such a dinner every day that you will be ready to lick the plates as clean as if they were washed."

"It is a fact," Schmucke remarked, "dat die dinners dat Montame Zipod cooks for me are better as de messes dey eat at der royal dable!"

In his eagerness, Schmucke, usually so full of respect for the powers that be, so far forgot himself as to imitate the irreverent newspapers which scoffed at the "fixed-price" dinners of Royalty.

"Really?" said Pons. "Very well, I will try to-morrow."

And at that promise Schmucke sprang from one end of the table to the other, sweeping off tablecloth, bottles, and dishes as he went, and hugged Pons to his heart. So might gas rush to combine with gas.

"Vat happiness!" cried he.

Mme. Cibot was quite touched. "Monsieur is going to dine here every day!" she cried proudly.

That excellent woman departed downstairs again in ignorance of the event which had brought about this result, entered her room like Josepha in William Tell, set down the plates and dishes on the table with a bang, and called aloud to her husband:

"Cibot! run to the Cafe Turc for two small cups of coffee, and tell the man at the stove that it is for me."

Then she sat down and rested her hands on her massive knees, and gazed out of the window at the opposite wall.

"I will go to-night and see what Ma'am Fontaine says," she thought.

Madame Fontaine told fortunes on the cards for all the servants in the quarter of the Marais.

"Since these two gentlemen came here, we have put two thousand francs in the savings bank. Two thousand francs in eight years! What luck! Would it be better to make no profit out of M. Pons' dinner and keep him here at home? Ma'am Fontaine's hen will tell me that."

Three years ago Mme. Cibot had begun to cherish a hope that her name might be mentioned in "her gentlemen's" wills; she had redoubled her zeal since that covetous thought tardily sprouted up in the midst of that so honest moustache. Pons hitherto had dined abroad, eluding her desire to have both of "her gentlemen" entirely under her management; his "troubadour" collector's life had scared away certain vague ideas which hovered in La Cibot's brain; but now her shadowy projects assumed the formidable shape of a definite plan, dating from that memorable dinner. Fifteen minutes later she reappeared in the dining-room with two cups of excellent coffee, flanked by a couple of tiny glasses of kirschwasser.

"Long lif Montame Zipod!" cried Schmucke; "she haf guessed right!"

The diner-out bemoaned himself a little, while Schmucke met his lamentations with coaxing fondness, like a home pigeon welcoming back a wandering bird. Then the pair set out for the theatre. Schmucke could not leave his friend in the condition to which he had been brought by the Camusots—mistresses and servants. He knew Pons so well; he feared lest some cruel, sad thought should seize on him at his conductor's desk, and undo all the good done by his welcome home to the nest. And Schmucke brought his friend back on his arm through the streets at midnight. A lover could not be more careful of his lady. He pointed out the edges of the curbstones, he was on the lookout whenever they stepped on or off the pavement, ready with a warning if there was a gutter to cross. Schmucke could have wished that the streets were paved with cotton-down; he would have had a blue sky overhead, and Pons should hear the music which all the angels in heaven were making for him. He had won the lost province in his friend's heart!

For nearly three months Pons and Schmucke dined together every day. Pons was obliged to retrench at once; for dinner at forty-five francs a month and wine at thirty-five meant precisely eighty francs less to spend on bric-a-brac. And very soon, in spite of all that Schmucke could do, in spite of his little German jokes, Pons fell to regretting the delicate dishes, the liqueurs, the good coffee, the table talk, the insincere politeness, the guests, and the gossip, and the houses where he used to dine. On the wrong side of sixty a man cannot break himself of a habit of thirty-six years' growth. Wine at a hundred and thirty francs per hogshead is scarcely a generous liquid in a gourmet's glass; every time that Pons raised it to his lips he thought, with infinite regret, of the exquisite wines in his entertainers' cellars. In short, at the end of three months, the cruel pangs which had gone near to break Pons' sensitive heart had died away; he forgot everything but the charms of society; and languished for them like some elderly slave of a petticoat compelled to leave the mistress who too repeatedly deceives him. In vain he tried to hide his profound and consuming melancholy; it was too plain that he was suffering from one of the mysterious complaints which the mind brings upon the body.

A single symptom will throw light upon this case of nostalgia (as it were) produced by breaking away from an old habit; in itself it is trifling, one of the myriad nothings which are as rings in a coat of chain-mail enveloping the soul in a network of iron. One of the keenest pleasures of Pons' old life, one of the joys of the dinner-table parasite at all times, was the "surprise," the thrill produced by the extra dainty dish added triumphantly to the bill of fare by the mistress of a bourgeois house, to give a festal air to the dinner. Pons' stomach hankered after that gastronomical satisfaction. Mme. Cibot, in the pride of her heart, enumerated every dish beforehand; a salt and savor once periodically recurrent, had vanished utterly from daily life. Dinner proceeded without le plat couvert, as our grandsires called it. This lay beyond the bounds of Schmucke's powers of comprehension. Pons had too much delicacy to grumble; but if the case of unappreciated genius is hard, it goes harder still with the stomach whose claims are ignored. Slighted affection, a subject of which too much has been made, is founded upon an illusory longing; for if the creature fails, love can turn to the Creator who has treasures to bestow. But the stomach!... Nothing can be compared to its sufferings; for, in the first place, one must live. Pons thought wistfully of certain creams—surely the poetry of cookery!—of certain white sauces, masterpieces of the art; of truffled chickens, fit to melt your heart; and above these, and more than all these, of the famous Rhine carp, only known at Paris, served with what condiments! There were days when Pons, thinking upon Count Popinot's cook, would sigh aloud, "Ah, Sophie!" Any passer-by hearing the exclamation might have thought that the old man referred to a lost mistress; but his fancy dwelt upon something rarer, on a fat Rhine carp with a sauce, thin in the sauce-boat, creamy upon the palate, a sauce that deserved the Montyon prize! The conductor of the orchestra, living on memories of past dinners, grew visibly leaner; he was pining away, a victim to gastric nostalgia.





XVI


By the beginning of the fourth month (towards the end of January, 1845), Pons' condition attracted attention at the theatre. The flute, a young man named Wilhelm, like almost all Germans; and Schwab, to distinguish him from all other Wilhelms, if not from all other Schwabs, judged it expedient to open Schmucke's eyes to his friend's state of health. It was a first performance of a piece in which Schmucke's instruments were all required.

"The old gentleman is failing," said the flute; "there is something wrong somewhere; his eyes are heavy, and he doesn't beat time as he used to do," added Wilhelm Schwab, indicating Pons as he gloomily took his place.

"Dat is alvays de vay, gif a man is sixty years old," answered Schmucke.

The Highland widow, in The Chronicles of the Canongate, sent her son to his death to have him beside her for twenty-four hours; and Schmucke could have sacrificed Pons for the sake of seeing his face every day across the dinner-table.

"Everybody in the theatre is anxious about him," continued the flute; "and, as the premiere danseuse, Mlle. Brisetout, says, 'he makes hardly any noise now when he blows his nose.'"

And, indeed, a peal like a blast of a horn used to resound through the old musician's bandana handkerchief whenever he raised it to that lengthy and cavernous feature. The President's wife had more frequently found fault with him on that score than on any other.

"I vould gif a goot teal to amuse him," said Schmucke, "he gets so dull."

"M. Pons always seems so much above the like of us poor devils, that, upon my word, I didn't dare to ask him to my wedding," said Wilhelm Schwab. "I am going to be married—"

"How?" demanded Schmucke.

"Oh! quite properly," returned Wilhelm Schwab, taking Schmucke's quaint inquiry for a gibe, of which that perfect Christian was quite incapable.

"Come, gentlemen, take your places!" called Pons, looking round at his little army, as the stage manager's bell rang for the overture.

The piece was a dramatized fairy tale, a pantomime called The Devil's Betrothed, which ran for two hundred nights. In the interval, after the first act, Wilhelm Schwab and Schmucke were left alone in the orchestra, with a house at a temperature of thirty-six degrees Reaumur.

"Tell me your hishdory," said Schmucke.

"Look there! Do you see that young man in the box yonder?... Do you recognize him?"

"Nefer a pit—"

"Ah! That is because he is wearing yellow gloves and shines with all the radiance of riches, but that is my friend Fritz Brunner out of Frankfort-on-the-Main."

"Dat used to komm to see du blav und sit peside you in der orghestra?"

"The same. You would not believe he could look so different, would you?"

The hero of the promised story was a German of that particular type in which the sombre irony of Goethe's Mephistopheles is blended with a homely cheerfulness found in the romances of August Lafontaine of pacific memory; but the predominating element in the compound of artlessness and guile, of shopkeeper's shrewdness, and the studied carelessness of a member of the Jockey Club, was that form of disgust which set a pistol in the hands of a young Werther, bored to death less by Charlotte than by German princes. It was a thoroughly German face, full of cunning, full of simplicity, stupidity, and courage; the knowledge which brings weariness, the worldly wisdom which the veriest child's trick leaves at fault, the abuse of beer and tobacco,—all these were there to be seen in it, and to heighten the contrast of opposed qualities, there was a wild diabolical gleam in the fine blue eyes with the jaded expression.Dressed with all the elegance of a city man, Fritz Brunner sat in full view of the house displaying a bald crown of the tint beloved by Titian, and a few stray fiery red hairs on either side of it; a remnant spared by debauchery and want, that the prodigal might have a right to spend money with the hairdresser when he should come into his fortune. A face, once fair and fresh as the traditional portrait of Jesus Christ, had grown harder since the advent of a red moustache; a tawny beard lent it an almost sinister look. The bright blue eyes had lost something of their clearness in the struggle with distress. The countless courses by which a man sells himself and his honor in Paris had left their traces upon his eyelids and carved lines about the eyes, into which a mother once looked with a mother's rapture to find a copy of her own fashioned by God's hand. This precocious philosopher, this wizened youth was the work of a stepmother.

Herewith begins the curious history of a prodigal son of Frankfort-on-the-Main—the most extraordinary and astounding portent ever beheld by that well-conducted, if central, city.





XVII


Gideon Brunner, father of the aforesaid Fritz, was one of the famous innkeepers of Frankfort, a tribe who make law-authorized incisions in travelers' purses with the connivance of the local bankers. An innkeeper and an honest Calvinist to boot, he had married a converted Jewess and laid the foundations of his prosperity with the money she brought him. When the Jewess died, leaving a son Fritz, twelve years of age, under the joint guardianship of his father and maternal uncle, a furrier at Leipsic, head of the firm of Virlaz and Company, Brunner senior was compelled by his brother-in-law (who was by no means as soft as his peltry) to invest little Fritz's money, a goodly quantity of current coin of the realm, with the house of Al-Sartchild. Not a penny of it was he allowed to touch. So, by way of revenge for the Israelite's pertinacity, Brunner senior married again. It was impossible, he said, to keep his huge hotel single-handed; it needed a woman's eye and hand. Gideon Brunner's second wife was an innkeeper's daughter, a very pearl, as he thought; but he had had no experience of only daughters spoiled by father and mother. The second Mme. Brunner behaved as German girls may be expected to behave when they are frivolous and wayward. She squandered her fortune, she avenged the first Mme. Brunner by making her husband as miserable a man as you could find in the compass of the free city of Frankfort-on-the-Main, where the millionaires, it is said, are about to pass a law compelling womankind to cherish and obey them alone. She was partial to all the varieties of vinegar commonly called Rhine wine in Germany; she was fond of articles Paris, of horses and dress; indeed, the one expensive taste which she had not was a liking for women. She took a dislike to little Fritz, and would perhaps have driven him mad if that young offspring of Calvinism and Judaism had not had Frankfort for his cradle and the firm of Virlaz at Leipsic for his guardian. Uncle Virlaz, however, deep in his furs, confined his guardianship to the safe-keeping of Fritz's silver marks, and left the boy to the tender mercies of this stepmother.

That hyena in woman's form was the more exasperated against the pretty child, the lovely Jewess' son, because she herself could have no children in spite of efforts worthy of a locomotive engine. A diabolical impulse prompted her to plunge her young stepson, at twenty-one years of age, into dissipations contrary to all German habits. The wicked German hoped that English horses, Rhine vinegar, and Goethe's Marguerites would ruin the Jewess' child and shorten his days; for when Fritz came of age, Uncle Virlaz had handed over a very pretty fortune to his nephew. But while roulette at Baden and elsewhere, and boon companions (Wilhelm Schwab among them) devoured the substance accumulated by Uncle Virlaz, the prodigal son himself remained by the will of Providence to point a moral to younger brothers in the free city of Frankfort; parents held him up as a warning and an awful example to their offspring to scare them into steady attendance in their cast-iron counting houses, lined with silver marks. But so far from perishing in the flower of his age, Fritz Brunner had the pleasure of laying his stepmother in one of those charming little German cemeteries, in which the Teuton indulges his unbridled passion for horticulture under the specious pretext of honoring his dead. And as the second Mme. Brunner expired while the authors of her being were yet alive, Brunner senior was obliged to bear the loss of the sums of which his wife had drained his coffers, to say nothing of other ills, which had told upon a Herculean constitution, till at the age of sixty the innkeeper had wizened and shrunk as if the famous Borgia's poison had undermined his system. For ten whole years he had supported his wife, and now he inherited nothing! The innkeeper was a second ruin of Heidelberg, repaired continually, it is true, by travelers' hotel bills, much as the remains of the castle of Heidelberg itself are repaired to sustain the enthusiasm of the tourists who flock to see so fine and well-preserved a relic of antiquity.

At Frankfort the disappointment caused as much talk as a failure. People pointed out Brunner, saying, "See what a man may come to with a bad wife that leaves him nothing and a son brought up in the French fashion."

In Italy and Germany the French nation is the root of all evil, the target for all bullets. "But the god pursuing his way——" (For the rest, see Lefranc de Pompignan's Ode.)

The wrath of the proprietor of the Grand Hotel de Hollande fell on others besides the travelers, whose bills were swelled with his resentment. When his son was utterly ruined, Gideon, regarding him as the indirect cause of all his misfortunes, refused him bread and salt, fire, lodging, and tobacco—the force of the paternal malediction in a German and an innkeeper could no farther go. Whereupon the local authorities, making no allowance for the father's misdeeds, regarded him as one of the most ill-used persons in Frankfort-on-the-Main, came to his assistance, fastened a quarrel on Fritz (une querelle d'Allemand), and expelled him from the territory of the free city. Justice in Frankfort is no whit wiser nor more humane than elsewhere, albeit the city is the seat of the German Diet. It is not often that a magistrate traces back the stream of wrongdoing and misfortune to the holder of the urn from which the first beginnings trickled forth. If Brunner forgot his son, his son's friends speedily followed the old innkeeper's example.

Ah! if the journalists, the dandies, and some few fair Parisians among the audience wondered how that German with the tragical countenance had cropped up on a first night to occupy a side box all to himself when fashionable Paris filled the house,—if these could have seen the history played out upon the stage before the prompter's box, they would have found it far more interesting than the transformation scenes of The Devil's Betrothed, though indeed it was the two hundred thousandth representation of a sublime allegory performed aforetime in Mesopotamia three thousand years before Christ was born.

Fritz betook himself on foot to Strasbourg, and there found what the prodigal son of the Bible failed to find—to wit, a friend. And herein is revealed the superiority of Alsace, where so many generous hearts beat to show Germany the beauty of a combination of Gallic wit and Teutonic solidity. Wilhelm Schwab, but lately left in possession of a hundred thousand francs by the death of both parents, opened his arms, his heart,his house, his purse to Fritz. As for describing Fritz's feelings, when dusty, down on his luck, and almost like a leper, he crossed the Rhine and found a real twenty-franc piece held out by the hand of a real friend,—that moment transcends the powers of the prose writer; Pindar alone could give it forth to humanity in Greek that should rekindle the dying warmth of friendship in the world. Put the names of Fritz and Wilheim beside those of Damon and Pythias, Castor and Pollux, Orestes and Pylades, Dubreuil and Pmejah, Schmucke and Pons, and all the names that we imagine for the two friends of Monomotapa, for La Fontaine (man of genius though he was) has made of them two disembodied spirits—they lack reality. The two new names may join the illustrious company, and with so much the more reason, since that Wilhelm who had helped to drink Fritz's inheritance now proceeded, with Fritz's assistance, to devour his own substance; smoking, needless to say, every known variety of tobacco.

The pair, strange to relate, squandered the property in the dullest, stupidest, most commonplace fashion, in Strasbourg brasseries, in the company of ballet-girls of the Strasbourg theatres, and little Alsaciennes who had not a rag of a tattered reputation left.

Every morning they would say, "We really must stop this, and make up our minds and do something or other with the money that is left."

"Pooh!" Fritz would retort, "just one more day, and to-morrow..." ah! to-morrow.

In the lives of Prodigal Sons, To-day is a prodigious coxcomb, but To-morrow is a very poltroon, taking fright at the big words of his predecessor. To-day is the truculent captain of old world comedy, To-morrow the clown of modern pantomime. When the two friends had reached their last thousand-franc note, they took places in the mail-coach, styled Royal, and departed for Paris, where they installed themselves in the attics of the Hotel du Rhin, in the Rue du Mail, the property of one Graff, formerly Gideon Brunner's head-waiter. Fritz found a situation as clerk in the Kellers' bank (on Graff's recommendation), with a salary of six hundred francs. And a place as book-keeper was likewise found for Wilhelm, in the business of Graff the fashionable tailor, brother of Graff of the Hotel du Rhin, who found the scantily-paid employment for the pair of prodigals, for the sake of old times, and his apprenticeship at the Hotel de Hollande. These two incidents—the recognition of a ruined man by a well-to-do friend, and a German innkeeper interesting himself in two penniless fellow-countrymen—give, no doubt, an air of improbability to the story, but truth is so much the more like fiction, since modern writers of fiction have been at such untold pains to imitate truth.

It was not long before Fritz, a clerk with six hundred francs, and Wilhelm, a book-keeper with precisely the same salary, discovered the difficulties of existence in a city so full of temptations. In 1837, the second year of their abode, Wilhelm, who possessed a pretty talent for the flute, entered Pons' orchestra, to earn a little occasional butter to put on his dry bread. As to Fritz, his only way to an increase of income lay through the display of the capacity for business inherited by a descendant of the Virlaz family. Yet, in spite of his assiduity, in spite of abilities which possibly may have stood in his way, his salary only reached the sum of two thousand francs in 1843. Penury, that divine stepmother, did for the two men all that their mothers had not been able to do for them; Poverty taught them thrift and worldly wisdom; Poverty gave them her grand rough education, the lessons which she drives with hard knocks into the heads of great men, who seldom know a happy childhood. Fritz and Wilhelm, being but ordinary men, learned as little as they possibly could in her school; they dodged the blows, shrank from her hard breast and bony arms, and never discovered the good fairy lurking within, ready to yield to the caresses of genius. One thing, however, they learned thoroughly—they discovered the value of money, and vowed to clip the wings of riches if ever a second fortune should come to their door.

This was the history which Wilhelm Schwab related in German, at much greater length, to his friend the pianist, ending with;

"Well, Papa Schmucke, the rest is soon explained. Old Brunner is dead. He left four millions! He made an immense amount of money out of Baden railways, though neither his son nor M. Graff, with whom we lodge, had any idea that the old man was one of the original shareholders. I am playing the flute here for the last time this evening; I would have left some days ago, but this was a first performance, and I did not want to spoil my part."

"Goot, mine friend," said Schmucke. "But who is die prite?"

"She is Mlle. Graff, the daughter of our host, the landlord of the Hotel du Rhin. I have loved Mlle. Emilie these seven years; she has read so many immoral novels, that she refused all offers for me, without knowing what might come of it. She will be a very wealthy young lady; her uncles, the tailors in the Rue de Richelieu, will leave her all their money. Fritz is giving me the money we squandered at Strasbourg five times over! He is putting a million francs in a banking house, M. Graff the tailor is adding another five hundred thousand francs, and Mlle. Emilie's father not only allows me to incorporate her portion—two hundred and fifty thousand francs—with the capital, but he himself will be a shareholder with as much again. So the firm of Brunner, Schwab and Company will start with two millions five hundred thousand francs. Fritz has just bought fifteen hundred thousand francs' worth of shares in the Bank of France to guarantee our account with them. That is not all Fritz's fortune. He has his father's house property, supposed to be worth another million, and he has let the Grand Hotel de Hollande already to a cousin of the Graffs."

"You look sad ven you look at your friend," remarked Schmucke,who had listened with great interest. "Kann you pe chealous of him?"

"I am jealous for Fritz's happiness," said Wilhelm. "Does that face look as if it belonged to a happy man? I am afraid of Paris; I should like to see him do as I am doing. The old tempter may awake again. Of our two heads, his carries the less ballast. His dress, and the opera-glass and the rest of it make me anxious. He keeps looking at the lorettes in the house. Oh! if you only knew how hard it is to marry Fritz. He has a horror of 'going a-courting,' as you say; you would have to give him a drop into a family, just as in England they give a man a drop into the next world."

During the uproar that usually marks the end of a first night, the flute delivered his invitation to the conductor. Pons accepted gleefully; and, for the first time in three months, Schmucke saw a smile on his friend's face. They went back to the Rue de Normandie in perfect silence; that sudden flash of joy had thrown a light on the extent of the disease which was consuming Pons. Oh, that a man so truly noble, so disinterested, so great in feeling, should have such a weakness!... This was the thought that struck the stoic Schmucke dumb with amazement. He grew woefully sad, for he began to see that there was no help for it; he must even renounce the pleasure of seeing "his goot Bons" opposite him at the dinner-table, for the sake of Pons' welfare; and he did not know whether he could give him up; the mere thought of it drove him distracted.





XIX


Meantime, Pons' proud silence and withdrawal to the Mons Aventinus of the Rue de Normandie had, as might be expected, impressed the Presidente, not that she troubled herself much about her parasite, now that she was freed from him. She thought, with her charming daughter, that Cousin Pons had seen through her little "Lili's" joke. But it was otherwise with her husband the President. Camusot de Marville, a short and stout man, grown solemn since his promotion at the Court, admired Cicero, preferred the Opera-Comique to the Italiens, compared the actors one with another, and followed the multitude step by step. He used to recite all the articles in the Ministerialist journals, as if he were saying something original, and in giving his opinion at the Council Board he paraphrased the remarks of the previous speaker. His leading characteristics were sufficiently well known; his position compelled him to take everything seriously; and he was particularly tenacious of family ties. Like most men who are ruled by their wives, the President asserted his independence in trifles, in which his wife was very careful not to thwart him. For a month he was satisfied with the Presidente's commonplace explanations of Pons' disappearance; but at last it struck him as singular that the old musician, a friend of forty years' standing, should first make them so valuable a present as a fan that belonged to Mme. de Pompadour, and then immediately discontinue his visits. Count Popinot had pronounced the trinket a masterpiece; when its owner went to Court, the fan had been passed from hand to hand, and her vanity was not a little gratified by the compliments it received; others had dwelt on the beauties of the ten ivory sticks, each one covered with delicate carving, the like of which had never been seen. A Russian lady (Russian ladies are apt to forget that they are not in Russia) had offered her six thousand francs for the marvel one day at Count Popinot's house, and smiled to see it in such hands. Truth to tell, it was a fan for a Duchess.

"It cannot be denied that poor Cousin Pons understands rubbish of that sort—" said Cecile, the day after the bid.

"Rubbish!" cried her parent. "Why, Government is just about to buy the late M. le Conseiller Dusommerard's collection for three hundred thousand francs; and the State and the Municipality of Paris between them are spending nearly a million francs over the purchase and repair of the Hotel de Cluny to house the 'rubbish,' as you call it.—Such 'rubbish,' dear child," he resumed, "is frequently all that remains of vanished civilizations. An Etruscan jar, and a necklace, which sometimes fetch forty and fifty thousand francs, is 'rubbish' which reveals the perfection of art at the time of the siege of Troy, proving that the Etruscans were Trojan refugees in Italy."

This was the President's cumbrous way of joking; the short, fat man was heavily ironical with his wife and daughter.

"The combination of various kinds of knowledge required to understand such 'rubbish,' Cecile," he resumed, "is a science in itself, called archaeology. Archaeology comprehends architecture, sculpture, painting, goldsmiths' work, ceramics, cabinetmaking (a purely modern art), lace, tapestry—in short, human handiwork of every sort and description."

"Then Cousin Pons is learned?" said Cecile.

"Ah! by the by, why is he never to be seen nowadays?" asked the President. He spoke with the air of a man in whom thousands of forgotten and dormant impressions have suddenly begun to stir, and shaping themselves into one idea, reach consciousness with a ricochet, as sportsmen say.

"He must have taken offence at nothing at all," answered his wife. "I dare say I was not as fully sensible as I might have been of the value of the fan that he gave me. I am ignorant enough, as you know, of—"

"You! One of Servin's best pupils, and you don't know Watteau?" cried the President.

"I know Gerard and David and Gros and Griodet, and M. de Forbin and M. Turpin de Crisse—"

"You ought—"

"Ought what, sir?" demanded the lady, gazing at her husband with the air of a Queen of Sheba.

"To know a Watteau when you see it, my dear. Watteau is very much in fashion," answered the President with meekness, that told plainly how much he owed to his wife.

This conversation took place a few days before that night of first performance of The Devil's Betrothed, when the whole orchestra noticed how ill Pons was looking. But by that time all the circle of dinner-givers who were used to seeing Pons' face at their tables, and to send him on errands, had begun to ask each other for news of him, and uneasiness increased when it was reported by some who had seen him that he was always in his place at the theatre. Pons had been very careful to avoid his old acquaintances whenever he met them in the streets; but one day it so fell out that he met Count Popinot, the ex-cabinet minister, face to face in the bric-a-brac dealer's shop in the new Boulevard Beaumarchais. The dealer was none other than that Monistrol of whom Pons had spoken to the Presidente, one of the famous and audacious vendors whose cunning enthusiasm leads them to set more and more value daily on their wares; for curiosities, they tell you, are growing so scarce that they are hardly to be found at all nowadays.

"Ah, my dear Pons, how comes it that we never see you now? We miss you very much, and Mme. Popinot does not know what to think of your desertion."

"M. le Comte," said the good man, "I was made to feel in the house of a relative that at my age one is not wanted in the world. I have never had much consideration shown me, but at any rate I had not been insulted. I have never asked anything of any man," he broke out with an artist's pride. "I have often made myself useful in return for hospitality. But I have made a mistake, it seems; I am indefinitely beholden to those who honor me by allowing me to sit at table with them; my friends, and my relatives.... Well and good; I have sent in my resignation as smellfeast. At home I find daily something which no other house has offered me—a real friend."

The old artist's power had not failed him; with tone and gesture he put such bitterness into the words, that the peer of France was struck by them. He drew Pons aside.

"Come, now, my old friend, what is it? What has hurt you? Could you not tell me in confidence? You will permit me to say that at my house surely you have always met with consideration—"

"You are the one exception," said the artist. "And besides, you are a great lord and a statesman, you have so many things to think about. That would excuse anything, if there were need for it."

The diplomatic skill that Popinot had acquired in the management of men and affairs was brought to bear upon Pons, till at length the story of his misfortunes in the President's house was drawn from him. Popinot took up the victim's cause so warmly that he told the story to Mme. Popinot as soon as he went home, and that excellent and noble-natured woman spoke to the Presidente on the subject at the first opportunity. As Popinot himself likewise said a word or two to the President, there was a general explanation in the family of Camusot de Marville. Camusot was not exactly master in his own house; but this time his remonstrance was so well founded in law and in fact, that his wife and daughter were forced to acknowledge the truth. They both humbled themselves and threw the blame on the servants. The servants, first bidden, and then chidden, only obtained pardon by a full confession, which made it clear to the President's mind that Pons had done rightly to stop away. The President displayed himself before the servants in all his masculine and magisterial dignity, after the manner of men who are ruled by their wives. He informed his household that they should be dismissed forthwith, and forfeit any advantages which their long term of service in his house might have brought them, unless from that time forward his cousin and all those who did him the honor of coming to his house were treated as he himself was. At which speech Madeleine was moved to smile.

"You have only one chance of salvation as it is," continued the President. "Go to my cousin, make your excuses to him, and tell him that you will lose your situations unless he forgives you, for I shall turn you all away if he does not."





XX


Next morning the President went out fairly early to pay a call on his cousin before going down to the court. The apparition of M. le President de Marville, announced by Mme. Cibot, was an event in the house. Pons, thus honored for the first time in his life saw reparation ahead.

"At last, my dear cousin," said the President after the ordinary greetings; "at last I have discovered the cause of your retreat. Your behavior increases, if that were possible, my esteem for you. I have but one word to say in that connection. My servants have all been dismissed. My wife and daughter are in despair; they want to see you to have an explanation. In all this, my cousin, there is one innocent person, and he is an old judge; you will not punish me, will you, for the escapade of a thoughtless child who wished to dine with the Popinots? especially when I come to beg for peace, admitting that all the wrong has been on our side?... An old friendship of thirty-six years, even suppose that there had been a misunderstanding, has still some claims. Come, sign a treaty of peace by dining with us to-night—"

Pons involved himself in a diffuse reply, and ended by informing his cousin that he was to sign a marriage contract that evening; how that one of the orchestra was not only going to be married, but also about to fling his flute to the winds to become a banker.

"Very well. To-morrow."

"Mme. la Comtesse Popinot has done me the honor of asking me, cousin. She was so kind as to write—"

"The day after to-morrow then."

"M. Brunner, a German, my first flute's future partner, returns the compliment paid him to-day by the young couple—"

"You are such pleasant company that it is not surprising that people dispute for the honor of seeing you. Very well, next Sunday? Within a week, as we say at the courts?"

"On Sunday we are to dine with M. Graff, the flute's father-in-law."

"Very well, on Saturday. Between now and then you will have time to reassure a little girl who has shed tears already over her fault. God asks no more than repentance; you will not be more severe than the Eternal father with poor little Cecile?—"

Pons, thus reached on his weak side, again plunged into formulas more than polite, and went as far as the stairhead with the President. An hour later the President's servants arrived in a troop on poor Pons' second floor. They behaved after the manner of their kind; they cringed and fawned; they wept. Madeleine took M. Pons aside and flung herself resolutely at his feet.

"It is all my fault; and monsieur knows quite well that I love him," here she burst into tears. "It was vengeance boiling in my veins; monsieur ought to throw all the blame of the unhappy affair on that. We are all to lose our pensions.... Monsieur, I was mad, and I would not have the rest suffer for my fault.... I can see now well enough that fate did not make me for monsieur. I have come to my senses, I aimed too high, but I love you still, monsieur. These ten years I have thought of nothing but the happiness of making you happy and looking after things here. What a lot!... Oh! if monsieur but knew how much I love him! But monsieur must have seen it through all my mischief-making. If I were to die to-morrow, what would they find?—A will in your favor, monsieur.... Yes, monsieur, in my trunk under my best things."

Madeleine had set a responsive chord vibrating; the passion inspired in another may be unwelcome, but it will always be gratifying to self-love; this was the case with the old bachelor. After generously pardoning Madeleine, he extended his forgiveness to the other servants, promising to use his influence with his cousin the Presidente on their behalf.

It was unspeakably pleasant to Pons to find all his old enjoyments restored to him without any loss of self-respect. The world had come to Pons, he had risen in the esteem of his circle; but Schmucke looked so downcast and dubious when he heard the story of the triumph, that Pons felt hurt. When, however, the kind-hearted German saw the sudden change wrought in Pons' face, he ended by rejoicing with his friend, and made a sacrifice of the happiness that he had known during those four months that he had had Pons all to himself. Mental suffering has this immense advantage over physical ills—when the cause is removed it ceases at once. Pons was not like the same man that morning. The old man, depressed and visibly failing, had given place to the serenely contented Pons, who entered the Presidente's house that October afternoon with the Marquise de Pompadour's fan in his pocket. Schmucke, on the other hand, pondered deeply over this phenomenon, and could not understand it; your true stoic never can understand the courtier that dwells in a Frenchman. Pons was a born Frenchman of the Empire; a mixture of eighteenth century gallantry and that devotion to womankind so often celebrated in songs of the type of Partant pour la Syrie. So Schmucke was fain to bury his chagrin beneath the flowers of his German philosophy; but a week later he grew so yellow that Mme. Cibot exerted her ingenuity to call in the parish doctor. The leech had fears of icterus, and left Mme. Cibot frightened half out of her wits by the Latin word for an attack of the jaundice.

Meantime the two friends went out to dinner together, perhaps for the first time in their lives. For Schmucke it was a return to the Fatherland; for Johann Graff of the Hotel du Rhin and his daughter Emilie, Wolfgang Graff the tailor and his wife, Fritz Brunner and Wilhelm Schwab, were Germans, and Pons and the notary were the only Frenchmen present at the banquet. The Graffs of the tailor's business owned a splendid house in the Rue de Richelieu, between the Rue Neuve-des-Petits-Champs and the Rue Villedo; they had brought up their niece, for Emilie's father, not without reason, had feared contact with the very mixed society of an inn for his daughter. The good tailor Graffs, who loved Emilie as if she had been their own daughter, were giving up the ground floor of their great house to the young couple, and here the bank of Brunner, Schwab and Company was to be established.

The arrangements for the marriage had been made about a month ago; some time must elapse before Fritz Brunner, author of all this felicity, could settle his deceased father's affairs, and the famous firm of tailors had taken advantage of the delay to redecorate the first floor and to furnish it very handsomely for the bride and bridegroom. The offices of the bank had been fitted into the wing which united a handsome business house with the hotel at the back, between courtyard and garden.





XXI


On the way from the Rue de Normandie to the Rue de Richelieu, Pons drew from the abstracted Schmucke the details of the story of the modern prodigal son, for whom Death had killed the fatted innkeeper. Pons, but newly reconciled with his nearest relatives, was immediately smitten with a desire to make a match between Fritz Brunner and Cecile de Marville. Chance ordained that the notary was none other than Berthier, old Cardot's son-in-law and successor, the sometime second clerk with whom Pons had been wont to dine.

"Ah! M. Berthier, you here!" he said, holding out a hand to his host of former days.

"We have not had the pleasure of seeing you at dinner lately; how is it?" returned the notary. "My wife has been anxious about you. We saw you at the first performance of The Devil's Betrothed, and our anxiety became curiosity?"

"Old folk are sensitive," replied the worthy musician; "they make the mistake of being a century behind the times, but how can it be helped? It is quite enough to represent one century—they cannot entirely belong to the century which sees them die."

"Ah!" said the notary, with a shrewd look, "one cannot run two centuries at once."

"By the by," continued Pons, drawing the young lawyer into a corner, "why do you not find some one for my cousin Cecile de Marville—"

"Ah! why—?" answered Berthier. "In this century, when luxury has filtered down to our very porters' lodges, a young fellow hesitates before uniting his lot with the daughter of a President of the Court of Appeal in Paris if she brings him only a hundred thousand francs. In the rank of life in which Mlle. de Marville's husband would take, the wife was never yet known that did not cost her husband three thousand francs a year;the interest on a hundred thousand francs would scarcely find her in pin-money. A bachelor with an income of fifteen or twenty thousand francs can live on an entre-sol; he is not expected to cut any figure; he need not keep more than one servant, and all his surplus income he can spend on his amusements; he puts himself in the hands of a good tailor, and need not trouble any further about keeping up appearances. Far-sighted mothers make much of him; he is one of the kings of fashion in Paris. But a wife changes everything. A wife means a properly furnished house," continued the lawyer; "she wants the carriage for herself; if she goes to the play, she wants a box, while the bachelor has only a stall to pay for; in short, a wife represents the whole of the income which the bachelor used to spend on himself. Suppose that husband and wife have thirty thousand francs a year between them—practically, the sometime bachelor is a poor devil who thinks twice before he drives out to Chantilly. Bring children on the scene—he is pinched for money at once. Now, as M. and Mme. de Marville are scarcely turned fifty, Cecile's expectations are bills that will not fall due for fifteen or twenty years to come; and no young fellow cares to keep them so long in his portfolio. The young featherheads who are dancing the polka with lorettes at the Jardin Mabille, are so cankered with self-interest, that they don't stand in need of us to explain both sides of the problem to them. Between ourselves, I may say that Mlle. de Marville scarcely sets hearts throbbing so fast but that their owners can perfectly keep their heads, and they are full of these anti-matrimonial reflections. If any eligible young man, in full possession of his senses and an income of twenty thousand francs, happens to be sketching out a programme of marriage that will satisfy his ambitions, Mlle. de Marville does not altogether answer the description—"

"And why not?" asked the bewildered musician.

"Oh!—" said the notary, "well—a young man nowadays may be as ugly as you and I, my dear Pons, but he is almost sure to have the impertinence to want six hundred thousand francs, a girl of good family, with wit and good looks and good breeding—flawless perfection in short."

"Then it will not be easy to marry her?"

"She will not be married so long as M. and Mme. de Marville cannot make up their minds to settle Marville on her when she marries; if they had chosen, she might have been the Vicomtesse Popinot by now. But here comes M. Brunner.—We are about to read the deed of partnership and the marriage contract."

Greetings and introductions over, the relations made Pons promise to sign the contract. He listened to the reading of the documents, and towards half-past five the party went into the dining-room. The dinner was magnificent, as a city merchant's dinner can be, when he allows himself a respite from money-making. Graff of the Hotel du Rhin was acquainted with the first provision dealers in Paris; never had Pons nor Schmucke fared so sumptuously. The dishes were a rapture to think of! Italian paste, delicate of flavor, unknown to the public; smelts fried as never smelts were fried before; fish from Lake Leman, with a real Genevese sauce, and a cream for plum-pudding which would have astonished the London doctor who is said to have invented it. It was nearly ten o'clock before they rose from table. The amount of wine, German and French, consumed at that dinner would amaze the contemporary dandy; nobody knows the amount of liquor that a German can imbibe and yet keep calm and quiet; to have even an idea of the quantity, you must dine in Germany and watch bottle succeed to bottle, like wave rippling after wave along the sunny shores of the Mediterranean, and disappear as if the Teuton possessed the absorbing power of sponges or sea sand. Perfect harmony prevails meanwhile; there is none of the racket that there would be over the liquor in France; the talk is as sober as a money-lender's extempore speech; countenances flush, like the faces of the brides in frescoes by Cornelius or Schnorr (imperceptibly, that is to say), and reminiscences are poured out slowly while the smoke puffs from the pipes.

About half-past ten that evening Pons and Schmucke found themselves sitting on a bench out in the garden, with the ex-flute between them; they were explaining their characters, opinions, and misfortunes, with no very clear idea as to why or how they had come to this point. In the thick of a potpourri of confidences, Wilhelm spoke of his strong desire to see Fritz married, expressing himself with vehement and vinous eloquence.

"What do you say to this programme for your friend Brunner?" cried Pons in confidential tones. "A charming and sensible young lady of twenty-four, belonging to a family of the highest distinction. The father holds a very high position as a judge; there will be a hundred thousand francs paid down and a million to come."

"Wait!" answered Schwab; "I will speak to Fritz this instant."

The pair watched Brunner and his friend as they walked round and round the garden; again and again they passed the bench, sometimes one spoke, sometimes the other. Pons was not exactly intoxicated; his head was a little heavy, but his thoughts, on the contrary, seemed all the lighter; he watched Fritz Brunner's face through the rainbow mist of fumes of wine, and tried to read auguries favorable to his family. Before very long Schwab introduced his friend and partner to M. Pons; Fritz Brunner expressed his thanks for the trouble which Pons had been so good as to take. In the conversation which followed, the two old bachelors Schmucke and Pons extolled the estate of matrimony, going so far as to say, without any malicious intent, "that marriage was the end of man." Tea and ices, punches and cakes, were served in the future home of the betrothed couple. The wine had begun to tell upon the honest merchants, and the general hilarity reached its height when it was announced that Schwab's partner thought of following his example.

At two o'clock that morning, Schmucke and Pons walked home along the boulevards, philosophizing a perte de raison as they went on the harmony pervading the arrangements of this our world below.





XXII


On the morrow of the banquet, Cousin Pons betook himself to his fair cousin the Presidente, overjoyed—poor dear noble soul!—to return good for evil. Surely he had attained to a sublime height, as every one will allow, for we live in an age when the Montyon prize is given to those who do their duty by carrying out the precepts of the Gospel.

"Ah!" said Pons to himself, as he turned the corner of the Rue de Choiseul, "they will lie under immense obligations to their parasite."

Any man less absorbed in his contentment, any man of the world, any distrustful nature would have watched the President's wife and daughter very narrowly on this first return to the house. But the poor musician was a child, he had all the simplicity of an artist, believing in goodness as he believed in beauty; so he was delighted when Cecile and her mother made much of him. After all the vaudevilles, tragedies, and comedies which had been played under the worthy man's eyes for twelve long years, he could not detect the insincerity and grimaces of social comedy, no doubt because he had seen too much of it. Any one who goes into society in Paris, and knows the type of woman, dried up, body and soul, by a burning thirst for social position, and a fierce desire to be thought virtuous, any one familiar with the sham piety and the domineering character of a woman whose word is law in her own house, may imagine the lurking hatred she bore this husband's cousin whom she had wronged. All the demonstrative friendliness of mother and daughter was lined with a formidable longing for revenge, evidently postponed. For the first time in Amelie de Marville's life she had been put in the wrong, and that in the sight of the husband over whom she tyrannized; and not only so—she was obliged to be amiable to the author of her defeat! You can scarcely find a match for this position save in the hypocritical dramas which are sometimes kept up for years in the sacred college of cardinals, or in chapters of certain religious orders.

At three o'clock, when the President came back from the law-courts, Pons had scarcely made an end of the marvelous history of his acquaintance, M. Frederic Brunner. Cecile had gone straight to the point. She wanted to know how Frederic Brunner was dressed, how he looked, his height and figure, the color of his hair and eyes; and when she had conjectured a distinguished air for Frederic, she admired his generosity of character.

"Think of his giving five hundred thousand francs to his companion in misfortune! Oh! mamma, I shall have a carriage and a box at the Italiens——"

Cecile grew almost pretty as she thought that all her mother's ambitions for her were about to be realized, that the hopes which had almost left her were to come to something after all.

As for the Presidente, all that she said was, "My dear little girl, you may perhaps be married within the fortnight."

All mothers with daughters of three-and-twenty address them as "little girl."

"Still," added the President, "in any case, we must have time to make inquiries; never will I give my daughter to just anybody—"

"As to inquiries," said Pons, "Berthier is drawing up the deeds. As to the young man himself, my dear cousin, you remember what you told me? Well, he is quite forty years old; he is bald. He wishes to find in family life a haven after a storm; I did not dissuade him; every man has his tastes—"

"One reason the more for a personal interview," returned the President. "I am not going to give my daughter to a valetudinarian."

"Very good, cousin, you shall see my suitor in five days if you like; for, with your views, a single interview would be enough—"

Cecile and her mother signified their rapture—

"Frederic is decidedly a distinguished amateur; he begged me to allow him to see my little collection at his leisure. You have never seen my pictures and curiosities; come and see them," he continued, looking at his relatives. "You can come simply as two ladies, brought by my friend Schmucke, and make M. Brunner's acquaintance without betraying yourselves. Frederic need not in the least know who you are."

"Admirable!" cried the President.

The attention they paid to the once scorned parasite may be left to the imagination! Poor Pons that day became the Presidente's cousin. The happy mother drowned her dislike in floods of joy; her looks, her smiles, her words sent the old man into ecstasies over the good that he had done, over the future that he saw by glimpses. Was he not sure to find dinners such as yesterday's banquet over the signing of the contract, multiplied indefinitely by three, in the houses of Brunner, Schwab, and Graff? He saw before him a land of plenty—a vie de cocagne, a miraculous succession of plats couverts, of delicate surprise dishes, of exquisite wines.

"If Cousin Pons brings this through," said the President, addressing his wife after Pons had departed, "we ought to settle an income upon him equal to his salary at the theatre."

"Certainly," said the lady; and Cecile was informed that if the proposed suitor found favor in her eyes, she must undertake to induce the old musician to accept a munificence in such bad taste.

Next day the President went to Berthier. He was anxious to make sure of M. Frederic Brunner's financial position. Berthier, forewarned by Mme. de Marville, had asked his new client Schwab to come. Schwab the banker was dazzled by the prospect of such a match for his friend (everybody knows how deeply a German venerates social distinctions, so much so, that in Germany a wife takes her husband's (official) title, and is the Frau General, the Frau Rath, and so forth)—Schwab therefore was as accommodating as a collector who imagines that he is cheating a dealer.

"In the first place," said Cecile's father, "as I shall make over my estate of Marville to my daughter, I should wish the contract to be drawn up on the dotal system. In that case, M. Brunner would invest a million francs in land to increase the estate, and by settling the land on his wife he would secure her and his children from any share in the liabilities of the bank."

Berthier stroked his chin. "He is coming on well, is M. le President," thought he.

When the dotal system had been explained to Schwab, he seemed much inclined that way for his friend. He had heard Fritz say that he wished to find some way of insuring himself against another lapse into poverty.

"There is a farm and pasture land worth twelve hundred thousand francs in the market at this moment," remarked the President.

"If we take up shares in the Bank of France to the amount of a million francs, that will be quite enough to guarantee our account," said Schwab. "Fritz does not want to invest more than two million francs in business; he will do as you wish, I am sure, M. le President."

The President's wife and daughter were almost wild with joy when he brought home this news. Never, surely, did so rich a capture swim so complacently into the nets of matrimony.

"You will be Mme. Brunner de Marville," said the parent, addressing his child; "I will obtain permission for your husband to add the name to his, and afterwards he can take out letters of naturalization. If I should be a peer of France some day, he will succeed me!"

The five days were spent by Mme. de Marville in preparations. On the great day she dressed Cecile herself, taking as much pains as the admiral of the British fleet takes over the dressing of the pleasure yacht for Her Majesty of England when she takes a trip to Germany.

Pons and Schmucke, on their side, cleaned, swept, and dusted Pons' museum rooms and furniture with the agility of sailors cleaning down a man-of-war. There was not a speck of dust on the carved wood; not an inch of brass but it glistened. The glasses over the pastels obscured nothing of the work of Latour, Greuze, and Liotard (illustrious painter of The Chocolate Girl), miracles of an art, alas! so fugitive. The inimitable lustre of Florentine bronze took all the varying hues of the light; the painted glass glowed with color. Every line shone out brilliantly, every object threw in its phrase in a harmony of masterpieces arranged by two musicians—both of whom alike had attained to be poets.

With a tact which avoided the difficulties of a late appearance on the scene of action, the women were the first to arrive; they wished to be on their own ground. Pons introduced his friend Schmucke, who seemed to his fair visitors to be an idiot; their heads were so full of the eligible gentleman with the four millions of francs, that they paid but little attention to the worthy Pons' dissertations upon matters of which they were completely ignorant. They looked with indifferent eyes at Petitot's enamels, spaced over crimson velvet, set in three frames of marvelous workmanship. Flowers by Van Huysum, David, and Heim; butterflies painted by Abraham Mignon; Van Eycks, undoubted Cranachs and Albrecht Durers; the Giorgione, the Sebastiano del Piombo; Backhuijzen, Hobbema, Gericault, the rarities of painting—none of these things so much as aroused their curiosity; they were waiting for the sun to arise and shine upon these treasures. Still, they were surprised by the beauty of some of the Etruscan trinkets and the solid value of the snuff-boxes, and out of politeness they went into ecstasies over some Florentine bronzes which they held in their hands when Mme. Cibot announced M. Brunner! They did not turn; they took advantage of a superb Venetian mirror framed in huge masses of carved ebony to scan this phoenix of eligible young men.

Frederic, forewarned by Wilhelm, had made the most of the little hair that remained to him. He wore a neat pair of trousers, a soft shade of some dark color, a silk waistcoat of superlative elegance and the very newest cut, a shirt with open-work, its linen hand-woven by a Friesland woman, and a blue-and-white cravat. His watch chain, like the head of his cane, came from Messrs. Florent and Chanor; and the coat, cut by old Graff himself, was of the very finest cloth. The Suede gloves proclaimed the man who had run through his mother's fortune. You could have seen the banker's neat little brougham and pair of horses mirrored in the surface of his speckless varnished boots, even if two pairs of sharp ears had not already caught the sound of wheels outside in the Rue de Normandie.

When the prodigal of twenty years is a kind of chrysalis from which a banker emerges at the age of forty, the said banker is usually an observer of human nature; and so much the more shrewd if, as in Brunner's case, he understands how to turn his German simplicity to good account. He had assumed for the occasion the abstracted air of a man who is hesitating between family life and the dissipations of bachelorhood. This expression in a Frenchified German seemed to Cecile to be in the highest degree romantic; the descendant of the Virlaz was a second Werther in her eyes—where is the girl who will not allow herself to weave a little novel about her marriage? Cecile thought herself the happiest of women when Brunner, looking round at the magnificent works of art so patiently collected during forty years, waxed enthusiastic, and Pons, to his no small satisfaction, found an appreciative admirer of his treasures for the first time in his life.

"He is poetical," the young lady said to herself; "he sees millions in the things. A poet is a man that cannot count and leaves his wife to look after his money—an easy man to manage and amuse with trifles."

Every pane in the two windows was a square of Swiss painted glass; the least of them was worth a thousand francs; and Pons possessed sixteen of these unrivaled works of art for which amateurs seek so eagerly nowadays. In 1815 the panes could be bought for six or ten francs apiece. The value of the glorious collection of pictures, flawless great works, authentic, untouched since they left the master's hands, could only be proved in the fiery furnace of a saleroom. Not a picture but was set in a costly frame; there were frames of every kind—Venetians, carved with heavy ornaments, like English plate of the present day; Romans, distinguishable among the others for a certain dash that artists call flafla; Spanish wreaths in bold relief; Flemings and Germans with quaint figures, tortoise-shell frames inlaid with copper and brass and mother-of-pearl and ivory; frames of ebony and boxwood in the styles of Louis Treize, Louis Quatorze, Louis Quinze, and Louis Seize—in short, it was a unique collection of the finest models. Pons, luckier than the art museums of Dresden and Vienna, possessed a frame by the famous Brustoloni—the Michael Angelo of wood-carvers.

Mlle. de Marville naturally asked for explanations of each new curiosity, and was initiated into the mysteries of art by Brunner. Her exclamations were so childish, she seemed so pleased to have the value and beauty of the paintings, carvings, or bronzes pointed out to her, that the German gradually thawed and looked quite young again, and both were led on further than they intended at this (purely accidental) first meeting.

The private view lasted for three hours. Brunner offered his arm when Cecile went downstairs. As they descended slowly and discreetly, Cecile, still talking fine art, wondered that M. Brunner should admire her cousin's gimcracks so much.

"Do you really think that these things that we have just seen are worth a great deal of money?"

"Mademoiselle, if your cousin would sell his collection, I would give eight hundred thousand francs for it this evening, and I should not make a bad bargain. The pictures alone would fetch more than that at a public sale."

"Since you say so, I believe it," returned she; "the things took up so much of your attention that it must be so."

"On! mademoiselle!" protested Brunner. "For all answer to your reproach, I will ask your mother's permission to call, so that I may have the pleasure of seeing you again."

"How clever she is, that 'little girl' of mine!" thought the Presidente, following closely upon her daughter's heels. Aloud she said, "With the greatest pleasure, monsieur. I hope that you will come at dinner-time with our Cousin Pons. The President will be delighted to make your acquaintance.—Thank you, cousin."

The lady squeezed Pons' arm with deep meaning; she could not have said more if she had used the consecrated formula, "Let us swear an eternal friendship." The glance which accompanied that "Thank you, cousin," was a caress.

When the young lady had been put into the carriage, and the jobbed brougham had disappeared down the Rue Charlot, Brunner talked bric-a-brac to Pons, and Pons talked marriage.

"Then you see no obstacle?" said Pons.

"Oh!" said Brunner, "she is an insignificant little thing, and the mother is a trifle prim.—We shall see."

"A handsome fortune one of these days.... More than a million—"

"Good-bye till Monday!" interrupted the millionaire. "If you should care to sell your collection of pictures, I would give you five or six hundred thousand francs—"

"Ah!" said Pons; he had no idea that he was so rich. "But they are my great pleasure in life, and I could not bring myself to part with them. I could only sell my collection to be delivered after my death."

"Very well. We shall see."

"Here we have two affairs afoot!" said Pons; he was thinking only of the marriage.

Brunner shook hands and drove away in his splendid carriage. Pons watched it out of sight. He did not notice that Remonencq was smoking his pipe in the doorway.





XXIV


That evening Mme. de Marville went to ask advice of her father-in-law, and found the whole Popinot family at the Camusots' house. It was only natural that a mother who had failed to capture an eldest son should be tempted to take her little revenge; so Mme. de Marville threw out hints of the splendid marriage that her Cecile was about to make.—"Whom can Cecile be going to marry?" was the question upon all lips. And Cecile's mother, without suspecting that she was betraying her secret, let fall words and whispered confidences, afterwards supplemented by Mme. Berthier, till gossip circulating in the bourgeois empyrean where Pons accomplished his gastronomical evolutions took something like the following form:

"Cecile de Marville is engaged to be married to a young German, a banker from philanthropic motives, for he has four millions; he is like a hero in a novel, a perfect Werther, charming and kind-hearted. He has sown his wild oats, and he is distractedly in love with Cecile; it is a case of love at first sight; and so much the more certain, since Cecile had all Pons' paintings of Madonnas for rivals," and so forth and so forth.

Two or three of the set came to call on the Presidente, ostensibly to congratulate, but really to find out whether or not the marvelous tale were true. For their benefit Mme. de Marville executed the following admirable variations on the theme of son-in-law which mothers may consult, as people used to refer to the Complete Letter Writer.

"A marriage is not an accomplished fact," she told Mme. Chiffreville, "until you have been in the mayor's office and the church. We have only come as far as a personal interview; so I count upon your friendship to say nothing of our hopes."

"You are very fortunate, madame; marriages are so difficult to arrange in these days."

"What can one do? It was chance; but marriages are often made in that way."

"Ah! well. So you are going to marry Cecile?" said Mme. Cardot.

"Yes," said Cecile's mother, fully understanding the meaning of the "so." "We were very particular, or Cecile would have been established before this. But now we have found everything we wish: money, good temper, good character, and good looks; and my sweet little girl certainly deserves nothing less. M. Brunner is a charming young man, most distinguished; he is fond of luxury, he knows life; he is wild about Cecile, he loves her sincerely; and in spite of his three or four millions, Cecile is going to accept him.—We had not looked so high for her; still, store is no sore."

"It was not so much the fortune as the affection inspired by my daughter which decided us," the Presidente told Mme. Lebas. "M. Brunner is in such a hurry that he wants the marriage to take place with the least possible delay."

"Is he a foreigner?"

"Yes, madame; but I am very fortunate, I confess. No, I shall not have a son-in-law, but a son. M. Brunner's delicacy has quite won our hearts. No one would imagine how anxious he was to marry under the dotal system. It is a great security for families. He is going to invest twelve hundred thousand francs in grazing land, which will be added to Marville some day."

More variations followed on the morrow. For instance—M. Brunner was a great lord, doing everything in lordly fashion; he did not haggle. If M. de Marville could obtain letters of naturalization, qualifying M. Brunner for an office under Government (and the Home Secretary surely could strain a point for M. de Marville), his son-in-law would be a peer of France. Nobody knew how much money M. Brunner possessed; "he had the finest horses and the smartest carriages in Paris!" and so on and so on.

From the pleasure with which the Camusots published their hopes, it was pretty clear that this triumph was unexpected.

Immediately after the interview in Pons' museum, M. de Marville, at his wife's instance, begged the Home Secretary, his chief, and the attorney for the crown to dine with him on the occasion of the introduction of this phoenix of a son-in-law. The three great personages accepted the invitation, albeit it was given on short notice; they all saw the part that they were to play in the family politics, and readily came to the father's support. In France we are usually pretty ready to assist the mother of marriageable daughters to hook an eligible son-in-law. The Count and Countess Popinot likewise lent their presence to complete the splendor of the occasion, although they thought the invitation in questionable taste. There were eleven in all. Cecile's grandfather, old Camusot, came, of course, with his wife to a family reunion purposely arranged to elicit a proposal from M. Brunner. The Camusot de Marvilles had given out that the guest of the evening was one of the richest capitalists in Germany, a man of taste (he was in love with "the little girl"), a future rival of the Nucingens, Kellers, du Tillets, and their like.

"It is our day," said the Presidente with elaborate simplicity, when she had named her guests one by one for the German whom she already regarded as her son-in-law. "We have only a few intimate friends—first, my husband's father, who, as you know, is sure to be raised to the peerage; M. le Comte and Mme. la Comtesse Popinot, whose son was not thought rich enough for Cecile; the Home Secretary; our First President; our attorney for the crown; our personal friends, in short.—We shall be obliged to dine rather late to-night, because the Chamber is sitting, and people cannot get away before six."

Brunner looked significantly at Pons, and Pons rubbed his hands as if to say, "Our friends, you see! My friends!"

Mme. de Marville, as a clever tactician, had something very particular to say to her cousin, that Cecile and her Werther might be left together for a moment. Cecile chattered away volubly, and contrived that Frederic should catch sight of a German dictionary, a German grammar, and a volume of Goethe hidden away in a place where he was likely to find them.

"Ah! are you learning German?" asked Brunner, flushing red.

For laying traps of this kind the Frenchwoman has not her match!

"Oh! how naughty you are!" she cried; "it is too bad of you, monsieur, to explore my hiding-places like this. I want to read Goethe in the original," she added; "I have been learning German for two years."

"Then the grammar must be very difficult to learn, for scarcely ten pages have been cut—" Brunner remarked with much candor.

Cecile, abashed, turned away to hide her blushes. A German cannot resist a display of this kind; Brunner caught Cecile's hand, made her turn, and watched her confusion under his gaze, after the manner of the heroes of the novels of Auguste Lafontaine of chaste memory.

"You are adorable," said he.

Cecile's petulant gesture replied, "So are you—who could help liking you?"

"It is all right, mamma," she whispered to her parent, who came up at that moment with Pons.

The sight of a family party on these occasions is not to be described. Everybody was well satisfied to see a mother put her hand on an eligible son-in-law. Compliments, double-barreled and double-charged, were paid to Brunner (who pretended to understand nothing); to Cecile, on whom nothing was lost; and to the Presidente, who fished for them. Pons heard the blood singing in his ears, the light of all the blazing gas-jets of the theatre footlights seemed to be dazzling his eyes, when Cecile, in a low voice and with the most ingenious circumspection, spoke of her father's plan of the annuity of twelve hundred francs. The old artist positively declined the offer, bringing forward the value of his fortune in furniture, only now made known to him by Brunner.

The Home Secretary, the First President, the attorney for the crown, the Popinots, and those who had other engagements, all went; and before long no one was left except M. Camusot senior, and Cardot the old notary, and his assistant and son-in-law Berthier. Pons, worthy soul, looking round and seeing no one but the family, blundered out a speech of thanks to the President and his wife for the proposal which Cecile had just made to him. So it is with those who are guided by their feelings; they act upon impulse. Brunner, hearing of an annuity offered in this way, thought that it had very much the look of a commission paid to Pons; he made an Israelite's return upon himself, his attitude told of more than cool calculation.

Meanwhile Pons was saying to his astonished relations, "My collection or its value will, in any case, go to your family, whether I come to terms with our friend Brunner or keep it." The Camusots were amazed to hear that Pons was so rich.

Brunner, watching, saw how all these ignorant people looked favorably upon a man once believed to be poor so soon as they knew that he had great possessions. He had seen, too, already that Cecile was spoiled by her father and mother; he amused himself, therefore, by astonishing the good bourgeois.

"I was telling mademoiselle," said he, "that M. Pons' pictures were worth that sum to me; but the prices of works of art have risen so much of late, that no one can tell how much the collection might sell for at public auction. The sixty pictures might fetch a million francs; several that I saw the other day were worth fifty thousand apiece."

"It is a fine thing to be your heir!" remarked old Cardot, looking at Pons.

"My heir is my Cousin Cecile here," answered Pons, insisting on the relationship.

There was a flutter of admiration at this.

"She will be a very rich heiress," laughed old Cardot, as he took his departure.

Camusot senior, the President and his wife, Cecile, Brunner, Berthier, and Pons were now left together; for it was assumed that the formal demand for Cecile's hand was about to be made. No sooner was Cardot gone, indeed, than Brunner began with an inquiry which augured well.

"I think I understood," he said, turning to Mme. de Marville, "that mademoiselle is your only daughter."

"Certainly," the lady said proudly.

"Nobody will make any difficulties," Pons, good soul, put in by way of encouraging Brunner to bring out his proposal.

But Brunner grew thoughtful, and an ominous silence brought on a coolness of the strangest kind. The Presidente might have admitted that her "little girl" was subject to epileptic fits. The President, thinking that Cecile ought not to be present, signed to her to go. She went. Still Brunner said nothing. They all began to look at one another. The situation was growing awkward. Camusot senior, a man of experience, took the German to Mme. de Marville's room, ostensibly to show him Pons' fan. He saw that some difficulty had arisen, and signed to the rest to leave him alone with Cecile's suitor-designate.

"Here is the masterpiece," said Camusot, opening out the fan.

Brunner took it in his hand and looked at it. "It is worth five thousand francs," he said after a moment.

"Did you not come here, sir, to ask for my granddaughter?" inquired the future peer of France.

"Yes, sir," said Brunner; "and I beg you to believe that no possible marriage could be more flattering to my vanity. I shall never find any one more charming nor more amiable, nor a young lady who answers to my ideas like Mlle. Cecile; but—"

"Oh, no buts!" old Camusot broke in; "or let us have the translation of your 'buts' at once, my dear sir."

"I am very glad, sir, that the matter has gone no further on either side," Brunner answered gravely. "I had no idea that Mlle. Cecile was an only daughter. Anybody else would consider this an advantage; but to me, believe me, it is an insurmountable obstacle to—"

"What, sir!" cried Camusot, amazed beyond measure. "Do you find a positive drawback in an immense advantage? Your conduct is really extraordinary; I should very much like to hear the explanation of it."

"I came here this evening, sir," returned the German phlegmatically, "intending to ask M. le President for his daughter's hand. It was my desire to give Mlle. Cecile a brilliant future by offering her so much of my fortune as she would consent to accept. But an only daughter is a child whose will is law to indulgent parents, who has never been contradicted. I have had the opportunity of observing this in many families, where parents worship divinities of this kind. And your granddaughter is not only the idol of the house, but Mme. la Presidente... you know what I mean. I have seen my father's house turned into a hell, sir, from this very cause. My stepmother, the source of all my misfortunes, an only daughter, idolized by her parents, the most charming betrothed imaginable, after marriage became a fiend incarnate. I do not doubt that Mlle. Cecile is an exception to the rule; but I am not a young man, I am forty years old, and the difference between our ages entails difficulties which would put it out of my power to make the young lady happy, when Mme. la Presidente always carried out her daughter's every wish and listened to her as if Mademoiselle was an oracle. What right have I to expect Mlle. Cecile to change her habits and ideas? Instead of a father and mother who indulge her every whim, she would find an egotistic man of forty; if she should resist, the man of forty would have the worst of it. So, as an honest man—I withdraw. If there should be any need to explain my visit here, I desire to be entirely sacrificed—"

"If these are your motives, sir," said the future peer of France, "however singular they may be, they are plausible—"

"Do not call my sincerity in question, sir," Brunner interrupted quickly. "If you know of a penniless girl, one of a large family, well brought up but without fortune, as happens very often in France; and if her character offers me security, I will marry her."

A pause followed; Frederic Brunner left Cecile's grandfather and politely took leave of his host and hostess. When he was gone, Cecile appeared, a living commentary upon her Werther's leave-taking; she was ghastly pale. She had hidden in her mother's wardrobe and overheard the whole conversation.

"Refused!..." she said in a low voice for her mother's ear.

"And why?" asked the Presidente, fixing her eyes upon her embar-rassed father-in-law.

"Upon the fine pretext that an only daughter is a spoilt child," replied that gentleman. "And he is not altogether wrong there," he added, seizing an opportunity of putting the blame on the daughter-in-law, who had worried him not a little for twenty years.

"It will kill my child!" cried the Presidente, "and it is your doing!" she exclaimed, addressing Pons, as she supported her fainting daughter, for Cecile thought well to make good her mother's words by sinking into her arms.

The President and his wife carried Cecile to an easy-chair, where she swooned outright. The grandfather rang for the servants.

"It is a plot of his weaving; I see it all now," said the infuriated mother.

Pons sprang up as if the trump of doom were sounding in his ears.

"Yes!" said the lady, her eyes like two springs of green bile, "this gentleman wished to repay a harmless joke by an insult. Who will believe that that German was right in his mind? He is either an accomplice in a wicked scheme of revenge, or he is crazy. I hope, M. Pons, that in future you will spare us the annoyance of seeing you in the house where you have tried to bring shame and dishonor."

Pons stood like a statue, with his eyes fixed on the pattern of the carpet.

"Well! Are you still here, monster of ingratitude?" cried she, turning round on Pons, who was twirling his thumbs.—"Your master and I are never at home, remember, if this gentleman calls," she continued, turning to the servants.—"Jean, go for the doctor; and bring hartshorn, Madeleine."

In the Presidente's eyes, the reason given by Brunner was simply an excuse, there was something else behind; but, at the same time, the fact that the marriage was broken off was only the more certain. A woman's mind works swiftly in great crises, and Mme. de Marville had hit at once upon the one method of repairing the check. She chose to look upon it as a scheme of revenge. This notion of ascribing a fiendish scheme to Pons satisfied family honor. Faithful to her dislike of the cousin, she treated a feminine suspicion as a fact. Women, generally speaking, hold a creed peculiar to themselves, a code of their own; to them anything which serves their interests or their passions is true. The Presidente went a good deal further. In the course of the evening she talked the President into her belief, and next morning found the magistrate convinced of his cousin's culpability. Every one, no doubt, will condemn the lady's horrible conduct; but what mother in Mme. Camusot's position will not do the same? Put the choice between her own daughter and an alien, she will prefer to sacrifice the honor of the latter. There are many ways of doing this, but the end in view is the same.

The old musician fled down the staircase in haste; but he went slowly along the boulevards to his theatre, he turned in mechanically at the door, and mechanically he took his place and conducted the orchestra. In the interval he gave such random answers to Schmucke's questions, that his old friend dissembled his fear that Pons' mind had given way. To so childlike a nature, the recent scene took the proportions of a catastrophe. He had meant to make every one happy, and he had aroused a terrible slumbering feeling of hate; everything had been turned topsy-turvy. He had at last seen mortal hate in the Presidente's eyes, tones, and gesture.

On the morrow, Mme. Camusot de Marville made a great resolution; the President likewise sanctioned the step now forced upon them by circumstances. It was determined that the estate of Marville should be settled upon Cecile at the time of her marriage, as well as the house in the Rue de Hanovre and a hundred thousand francs. In the course of the morning, the Presidente went to call upon the Comtesse Popinot; for she saw plainly that nothing but a settled marriage could enable them to recover after such a check. To the Comtesse Popinot she told the shocking story of Pons' revenge, Pons' hideous hoax. It all seemed probable enough when it came out that the marriage had been broken off simply on the pretext that Cecile was an only daughter. The Presidente next dwelt artfully upon the advantage of adding "de Marville" to the name of Popinot; and the immense dowry. At the present price fetched by land in Normandy, at two per cent, the property represented nine hundred thousand francs, and the house in the Rue de Hanovre about two hundred and fifty thousand. No reasonable family could refuse such an alliance. The Comte and Comtesse Popinot accepted; and as they were now touched by the honor of the family which they were about to enter, they promised to help explain away yesterday evening's mishap.

And now in the house of the elder Camusot, before the very persons who had heard Mme. de Marville singing Frederic Brunner's praises but a few days ago, that lady, to whom nobody ventured to speak on the topic, plunged courageously into explanations.

"Really, nowadays" (she said), "one could not be too careful if a marriage was in question, especially if one had to do with foreigners."

"And why, madame?"

"What has happened to you?" asked Mme. Chiffreville.

"Do you not know about our adventure with that Brunner, who had the audacity to aspire to marry Cecile? His father was a German that kept a wine-shop, and his uncle is a dealer in rabbit-skins!"

"Is it possible? So clear-sighted as you are!..." murmured a lady.

"These adventurers are so cunning. But we found out everything through Berthier. His friend is a beggar that plays the flute. He is friendly with a person who lets furnished lodgings in the Rue du Mail and some tailor or other.... We found out that he had led a most disreputable life, and no amount of fortune would be enough for a scamp that has run through his mother's property."

"Why, Mlle. de Marville would have been wretched!" said Mme. Berthier.

"How did he come to your house?" asked old Mme. Lebas.

"It was M. Pons. Out of revenge, he introduced this fine gentleman to us, to make us ridiculous.... This Brunner (it is the same name as Fontaine in French)—this Brunner, that was made out to be such a grandee, has poor enough health, he is bald, and his teeth are bad. The first sight of him was enough for me; I distrusted him from the first."

"But how about the great fortune that you spoke of?" a young married woman asked shyly.

"The fortune was not nearly so large as they said. These tailors and the landlord and he all scraped the money together among them, and put all their savings into this bank that they are starting. What is a bank for those that begin in these days? Simply a license to ruin themselves. A banker's wife may lie down at night a millionaire and wake up in the morning with nothing but her settlement. At first word, at the very first sight of him, we made up our minds about this gentleman—he is not one of us. You can tell by his gloves, by his waistcoat, that he is a working man, the son of a man that kept a pot-house somewhere in Germany; he has not the instincts of a gentleman; he drinks beer, and he smokes—smokes? ah! madame, twenty-five pipes a day!... What would have become of poor Lili? ... It makes me shudder even now to think of it. God has indeed preserved us! And besides, Cecile never liked him.... Who would have expected such a trick from a relative, an old friend of the house that had dined with us twice a week for twenty years? We have loaded him with benefits, and he played his game so well, that he said Cecile was his heir before the Keeper of the Seals and the Attorney General and the Home Secretary!... That Brunner and M. Pons had their story ready, and each of them said that the other was worth millions!... No, I do assure you, all of you would have been taken in by an artist's hoax like that."

In a few weeks' time, the united forces of the Camusot and Popinot families gained an easy victory in the world, for nobody undertook to defend the unfortunate Pons, that parasite, that curmudgeon, that skinflint, that smooth-faced humbug, on whom everybody heaped scorn; he was a viper cherished in the bosom of the family, he had not his match for spite, he was a dangerous mountebank whom nobody ought to mention.





XXVI


About a month after the perfidious Werther's withdrawal, poor Pons left his bed for the first time after an attack of nervous fever, and walked along the sunny side of the street leaning on Schmucke's arm. Nobody in the Boulevard du Temple laughed at the "pair of nutcrackers," for one of the old men looked so shattered, and the other so touchingly careful of his invalid friend. By the time that they reached the Boulevard Poissonniere, a little color came back to Pons' face; he was breathing the air of the boulevards, he felt the vitalizing power of the atmosphere of the crowded street, the life-giving property of the air that is noticeable in quarters where human life abounds; in the filthy Roman Ghetto, for instance, with its swarming Jewish population, where malaria is unknown. Perhaps, too, the sight of the streets, the great spectacle of Paris, the daily pleasure of his life, did the invalid good. They walked on side by side, though Pons now and again left his friend to look at the shop windows. Opposite the Theatre des Varietes he saw Count Popinot, and went up to him very respectfully, for of all men Pons esteemed and venerated the ex-Minister.

The peer of France answered him severely: "I am at a loss to understand, sir, how you can have no more tact than to speak to a near connection of a family whom you tried to brand with shame and ridicule by a trick which no one but an artist could devise. Understand this, sir, that from to-day we must be complete strangers to each other. Mme. la Comtesse Popinot, like every one else, feels indignant at your behavior to the Marvilles."

And Count Popinot passed on, leaving Pons thunderstruck. Passion, justice, policy, and great social forces never take into account the condition of the human creature whom they strike down. The statesman, driven by family considerations to crush Pons, did not so much as see the physical weakness of his redoubtable enemy.

"Vat is it, mine boor friend?" exclaimed Schmucke, seeing how white Pons had grown.

"It is a fresh stab in the heart," Pons replied, leaning heavily on Schmucke's arm. "I think that no one, save God in heaven, can have any right to do good, and that is why all those who meddle in His work are so cruelly punished."

The old artist's sarcasm was uttered with a supreme effort; he was trying, excellent creature, to quiet the dismay visible in Schmucke's face.

"So I dink," Schmucke replied simply.

Pons could not understand it. Neither the Camusots nor the Popinots had sent him notice of Cecile's wedding. On the Boulevard des Italiens Pons saw M. Cardot coming towards them. Warned by Count Popinot's allocution, Pons was very careful not to accost the old acquaintance with whom he had dined once a fortnight for the last year; he lifted his hat, but the other, mayor and deputy of Paris, threw him an indignant glance and went by. Pons turned to Schmucke.

"Do go and ask him what it is that they all have against me," he said to the friend who knew all the details of the catastrophe that Pons could tell him.

"Mennseir," Schmucke began diplomatically, "mine friend Bons is chust recofering from an illness; you haf no doubt fail to rekognize him?"

"Not in the least."

"But mit vat kann you rebroach him?"

"You have a monster of ingratitude for a friend, sir; if he is still alive, it is because nothing kills ill weeds. People do well to mistrust artists; they are as mischievous and spiteful as monkeys. This friend of yours tried to dishonor his own family, and to blight a young girl's character, in revenge for a harmless joke. I wish to have nothing to do with him; I shall do my best to forget that I have known him, or that such a man exists. All the members of his family and my own share the wish, sir, so do all the persons who once did the said Pons the honor of receiving him."

"Boot, mennseir, you are a reasonaple mann; gif you vill bermit me, I shall exblain die affair—"

"You are quite at liberty to remain his friend, sir, if you are minded that way," returned Cardot, "but you need go no further; for I must give you warning that in my opinion those who try to excuse or defend his conduct are just as much to blame."

"To chustify it?"

"Yes, for his conduct can neither be justified nor qualified."

And with that word, the deputy for the Seine went his way; he would not hear another syllable.

"I have two powers in the State against me," smiled poor Pons, when Schmucke had repeated these savage speeches.

"Eferpody is against us," Schmucke answered dolorously. "Let us go avay pefore we shall meed oder fools."

Never before in the course of a truly ovine life had Schmucke uttered such words as these. Never before had his almost divine meekness been ruffled. He had smiled childlike on all the mischances that befell him, but he could not look and see his sublime Pons maltreated; his Pons, his unknown Aristides, the genius resigned to his lot, the nature that knew no bitterness, the treasury of kindness, the heart of gold!... Alceste's indignation filled Schmucke's soul—he was moved to call Pons' amphitryons "fools." For his pacific nature that impulse equaled the wrath of Roland. With wise foresight, Schmucke turned to go home by the way of the Boulevard du Temple, Pons passively submitting like a fallen fighter, heedless of blows; but chance ordered that he should know that all his world was against him. The House of Peers, the Chamber of Deputies, strangers and the family, the strong, the weak, and the innocent, all combined to send down the avalanche.

In the Boulevard Poissonniere, Pons caught sight of that very M. Cardot's daughter, who, young as she was, had learned to be charitable to others through trouble of her own. Her husband knew a secret by which he kept her in bondage. She was the only one among Pons' hostesses whom he called by her Christian name; he addressed Mme. Berthier as "Felicie," and he thought that she understood him. The gentle creature seemed to be distressed by the sight of Cousin Pons, as he was called (though he was in no way related to the family of the second wife of a cousin by marriage). There was no help for it, however; Felicie Berthier stopped to speak to the invalid.

"I did not think you were cruel, cousin," she said; "but if even a quarter of all that I hear of you is true, you are very false.... Oh! do not justify yourself," she added quickly, seeing Pons' significant gesture, "it is useless, for two reasons. In the first place, I have no right to accuse or judge or condemn anybody, for I myself know so well how much may be said for those who seem to be most guilty; secondly, your explanation would do no good. M. Berthier drew up the marriage contract for Mlle. de Marville and the Vicomte Popinot; he is so exasperated, that if he knew that I had so much as spoken one word to you, one word for the last time, he would scold me. Everybody is against you."

"So it seems indeed, madame," Pons said, his voice shaking as he lifted his hat respectfully.

Painfully he made his way back to the Rue de Normandie. The old German knew from the heavy weight on his arm that his friend was struggling bravely against failing physical strength. That third encounter was like the verdict of the Lamb at the foot of the throne of God; and the anger of the Angel of the Poor, the symbol of the Peoples, is the last word of Heaven. They reached home without another word. There are moments in our lives when the sense that our friend is near is all that we can bear. Our wounds smart under the consoling words that only reveal the depths of pain. The old pianist, you see, possessed a genius for friendship, the tact of those who, having suffered much, knew the customs of suffering.

Pons was never to take a walk again. From one illness he fell into another. He was of a sanguine-bilious temperament, the bile passed into his blood, and a violent liver attack was the result. He had never known a day's illness in his life till a month ago; he had never consulted a doctor; so La Cibot, with almost motherly care and intentions at first of the very best, called in "the doctor of the quarter."





XXVII


In every quarter of Paris there is a doctor whose name and address are only known to the working classes, to the little tradespeople and the porters, and in consequence he is called "the doctor of the quarter." He undertakes confinement cases, he lets blood, he is in the medical profession pretty much what the "general servant" of the advertising column is in the scale of domestic service. He must perforce be kind to the poor, and tolerably expert by reason of much practice, and he is generally popular. Dr. Poulain, called in by Mme. Cibot, gave an inattentive ear to the old musician's complainings. Pons groaned out that his skin itched; he had scratched himself all night long, till he could scarcely feel. The look of his eyes, with the yellow circles about them, corroborated the symptoms.

"Had you some violent shock a couple of days ago?" the doctor asked the patient.

"Yes, alas!"

"You have the same complaint that this gentleman was threatened with," said Dr. Poulain, looking at Schmucke as he spoke; "it is an attack of jaundice, but you will soon get over it," he added, as he wrote a prescription.

But in spite of that comfortable phrase, the doctor's eyes had told another tale as he looked professionally at the patient; and the death-sentence, though hidden under stereotyped compassion, can always be read by those who wish to know the truth. Mme. Cibot gave a spy's glance at the doctor, and read his thought; his bedside manner did not deceive her; she followed him out of the room.

"Do you think he will get over it?" asked Mme. Cibot, at the stairhead.

"My dear Mme. Cibot, your lodger is a dead man; not because of the bile in the system, but because his vitality is low. Still, with great care,your patient may pull through. Somebody ought to take him away for a change—"

"How is he to go?" asked Mme. Cibot. "He has nothing to live upon but his salary; his friend has just a little money from some great ladies, very charitable ladies, in return for his services, it seems. They are two children. I have looked after them for nine years."

"I spend my life watching people die, not of their disease, but of another bad and incurable complaint—the want of money," said the doctor. "How often it happens that so far from taking a fee, I am obliged to leave a five-franc piece on the mantel-shelf when I go—"

"Poor, dear M. Poulain!" cried Mme. Cibot. "Ah, if you hadn't only the hundred thousand livres a year, what some stingy folks has in the quarter (regular devils from hell they are), you would be like Providence on earth."

Dr. Poulain had made the little practice, by which he made a bare subsistence, chiefly by winning the esteem of the porters' lodges in his district. So he raised his eyes to heaven and thanked Mme. Cibot with a solemn face worthy of Tartuffe.

"Then you think that with careful nursing our dear patient will get better, my dear M. Poulain?"

"Yes, if this shock has not been too much for him."

"Poor man! Who can have vexed him? There isn't nobody like him on earth except his friend M. Schmucke. I will find out what is the matter, and I will undertake to give them that upset my gentleman a hauling over the coals—"

"Look here, my dear Mme. Cibot," said the doctor as they stood in the gateway, "one of the principal symptoms of his complaint is great irritability; and as it is hardly to be supposed that he can afford a nurse, the task of nursing him will fall to you. So—"

"Are you talking of Mouchieu Ponsh?" asked the marine store-dealer. He was sitting smoking on the curb-post in the gateway, and now he rose to join in the conversation.

"Yes, Daddy Remonencq."

"All right," said Remonencq, "ash to moneysh, he ish better off than Mouchieu Monishtrol and the big men in the curioshity line. I know enough in the art line to tell you thish—the dear man has treasursh!"

"Look here, I thought you were laughing at me the other day when my gentlemen were out and I showed you the old rubbish upstairs," said Mme. Cibot.

In Paris, where walls have ears, where doors have tongues, and window bars have eyes, there are few things more dangerous than the practice of standing to chat in a gateway. Partings are like postscripts to a letter—indiscreet utterances that do as much mischief to the speaker as to those who overhear them. A single instance will be sufficient as a parallel to an event in this history.





XXVIII


In the time of the Empire, when men paid considerable attention to their hair, one of the first coiffeurs of the day came out of a house where he had just been dressing a pretty woman's head. This artist in question enjoyed the custom of all the lower floor inmates of the house; and among these, there flourished an elderly bachelor guarded by a housekeeper who detested her master's next-of-kin. The ci-devant young man, falling seriously ill, the most famous of doctors of the day (they were not as yet styled the "princes of science") had been called in to consult upon his case; and it so chanced that the learned gentlemen were taking leave of one another in the gateway just as the hairdresser came out. They were talking as doctors usually talk among themselves when the farce of a consultation is over. "He is a dead man," quoth Dr. Haudry.—"He had not a month to live," added Desplein, "unless a miracle takes place."—These were the words overheard by the hairdresser. Like all hairdressers, he kept up a good understanding with his customers' servants. Prodigious greed sent the man upstairs again; he mounted to the ci-devant young man's apartment, and promised the servant-mistress a tolerably handsome commission to persuade her master to sink a large portion of his money in an annuity. The dying bachelor, fifty-six by count of years, and twice as old as his age by reason of amorous campaigns, owned, among other property, a splendid house in the Rue de Richelieu, worth at that time about two hundred and fifty thousand francs. It was this house that the hairdresser coveted; and on agreement to pay an annuity of thirty thousand francs so long as the bachelor lived, it passed into his hands. This happened in 1806. And in this year 1846 the hairdresser is still paying that annuity. He has retired from business, he is seventy years old; the ci-devant young man is in his dotage; and as he has married his Mme. Evrard, he may last for a long while yet. As the hairdresser gave the woman thirty thousand francs, his bit of real estate has cost him, first and last, more than a million, and the house at this day is worth eight or nine hundred thousand francs.

Like the hairdresser, Remonencq the Auvergnat had overheard Brunner's parting remark in the gateway on the day of Cecile's first interview with that phoenix of eligible men. Remonencq at once longed to gain a sight of Pons' museum; and as he lived on good terms with his neighbors the Cibots, it was not very long before the opportunity came one day when the friends were out. The sight of such treasures dazzled him; he saw a "good haul," in dealers' phrase, which being interpreted means a chance to steal a fortune. He had been meditating this for five or six days.

"I am sho far from joking," he said, in reply to Mme. Cibot's remark, "that we will talk the thing over; and if the good shentleman will take an annuity, of fifty thousand francsh, I will shtand a hamper of wine, if—"

"Fifty thousand francs!" interrupted the doctor; "what are you thinking about? Why, if the good man is so well off as that, with me in attendance, and Mme. Cibot to nurse him, he may get better—for liver complaint is a disease that attacks strong constitutions."

"Fifty, did I shay? Why, a shentleman here, on your very doorshtep, offered him sheven hundred thoushand francsh, shimply for the pictursh, fouchtra!"

While Remonencq made this announcement, Mme. Cibot was looking at Dr. Poulain. There was a strange expression in her eyes; the devil might have kindled that sinister glitter in their tawny depths.

"Oh, come! we must not pay any attention to such idle tales," said the doctor, well pleased, however, to find that his patient could afford to pay for his visits.

"If my dear Mme. Cibot, here, would let me come and bring an ekshpert (shinsh the shentleman upshtairs ish in bed), I will shertainly find the money in a couple of hoursh, even if sheven hundred thousand francsh ish in queshtion—"

"All right, my friend," said the doctor. "Now, Mme. Cibot, be careful never to contradict the invalid. You must be prepared to be very patient with him, for he will find everything irritating and wearisome, even your services; nothing will please him; you must expect grumbling—"

"He will be uncommonly hard to please," said La Cibot.

"Look here, mind what I tell you," the doctor said in a tone of authority, "M. Pons' life is in the hands of those that nurse him; I shall come perhaps twice a day. I shall take him first on my round."

The doctor's profound indifference to the fate of a poor patient had suddenly given place to a most tender solicitude when he saw that the speculator was serious, and that there was a possible fortune in question.

"He will be nursed like a king," said Madame Cibot, forcing up enthusiasm.

She waited till the doctor turned the corner into the Rue Charlot; then she fell to talking again with the dealer in old iron. Remonencq had finished smoking his pipe, and stood in the doorway of his shop, leaning against the frame; he had purposely taken this position; he meant the portress to come to him.

The shop had once been a cafe. Nothing had been changed there since the Auvergnat discovered it and took over the lease; you could still read "Cafe de Normandie" on the strip left above the windows in all modern shops. Remonencq had found somebody, probably a housepainter's apprentice, who did the work for nothing, to paint another inscription in the remaining space below—"REMONENCQ," it ran, "DEALER IN MARINE STORES, FURNITURE BOUGHT"—painted in small black letters. All the mirrors, tables, seats, shelves, and fittings of the Cafe de Normandie had been sold, as might have been expected, before Remonencq took possession of the shop as it stood, paying a yearly rent of six hundred francs for the place, with a back shop, a kitchen, and a single room above, where the head-waiter used to sleep, for the house belonging to the Cafe de Normandie was let separately. Of the former splendor of the cafe, nothing now remained save the plain light green paper on the walls, and the strong iron bolts and bars of the shop-front.

When Remonencq came hither in 1831, after the Revolution of July, he began by displaying a selection of broken doorbells, cracked plates, old iron, and the obsolete scales and weights abolished by a Government which alone fails to carry out its own regulations, for pence and half pence of the time of Louis XVI are still in circulation. After a time this Auvergnat, a match for five ordinary Auvergnats, bought up old saucepans and kettles, old picture-frames, old copper, and chipped china. Gradually, as the shop was emptied and filled, the quality of the stock-in-trade improved, like Nicolet's farces. Remonencq persisted in an unfailing and prodigiously profitable martingale, a "system" which any philosophical idler may study as he watches the increasing value of the stock kept by this intelligent class of trader. Picture-frames and copper succeed to tin-ware, argand lamps, and damaged crockery; china marks the next transition; and after no long tarriance in the "omnium gatherum" stage, the shop becomes a museum. Some day or other the dusty windows are cleaned, the interior is restored, the Auvergnat relinquishes velveteen and jackets for a great-coat, and there he sits like a dragon guarding his treasure, surrounded by masterpieces! He is a cunning connoisseur by this time; he has increased his capital tenfold; he is not to be cheated; he knows the tricks of the trade. The monster among his treasures looks like some old hag among a score of young girls that she offers to the public. Beauty and miracles of art are alike indifferent to him; subtle and dense as he is, he has a keen eye to profits, he talks roughly to those who know less than he does; he has learned to act a part, he pretends to love his pictures, or again he lets you know the price he himself gave for the things, he offers to let you see the memoranda of the sale. He is a Proteus; in one hour he can be Jocrisse, Janot, Queue-rouge, Mondor, Hapagon, or Nicodeme.

The third year found armor, and old pictures, and some tolerably fine clocks in Remonencq's shop. He sent for his sister, and La Remonencq came on foot all the way from Auvergne to take charge of the shop while her brother was away. A big and very ugly woman, dressed like a Japanese idol, a half-idiotic creature with a vague, staring gaze she would not bate a centime of the prices fixed by her brother. In the intervals of business she did the work of the house, and solved the apparently insoluble problem—how to live on "the mists of the Seine." The Remonencqs' diet consisted of bread and herrings, with the outside leaves of lettuce or vegetable refuse selected from the heaps deposited in the kennel before the doors of eating-houses. The two between them did not spend more than fivepence a day on food (bread included), and La Remonencq earned the money by sewing or spinning.

Remonencq came to Paris in the first instance to work as an errand-boy. Between the years 1825 and 1831 he ran errands for dealers in curiosities in the Boulevard Beaumarchais or coppersmiths in the Rue de Lappe. It is the usual start in life in his line of business. Jews, Normans, Auvergnats, and Savoyards, those four different races of men all have the same instincts, and make their fortunes in the same way; they spend nothing, make small profits, and let them accumulate at compound interest. Such is their trading charter, and that charter is no delusion.

Remonencq at this moment had made it up with his old master Monistrol; he did business with wholesale dealers, he was a chineur (the technical word), plying his trade in thebanlieue, which, as everybody knows, extends for some forty leagues round Paris. After fourteen years of business, he had sixty thousand francs in hand and a well-stocked shop. He lived in the Rue de Normandie because the rent was low, but casual customers were scarce, most of his goods were sold to other dealers, and he was content with moderate gains. All his business transactions were carried on in the Auvergue dialect orcharabia, as people call it. Remonencq cherished a dream! He wished to establish himself on a boulevard, to be a rich dealer in curiosities, and do a direct trade with amateurs some day. And, indeed, within him there was a formidable man of business. His countenance was the more inscrutable because it was glazed over by a deposit of dust and particles of metal glued together by the sweat of his brow; for he did everything himself, and the use and wont of bodily labor had given him something of the stoical impassibility of the old soldiers of 1799. In personal appearance Remonencq was short and thin; his little eyes were set in his head in porcine fashion; a Jew's slyness and concentrated greed looked out of those dull blue circles, though in his case the false humility that masks the Hebrew's unfathomed contempt for the Gentile was lacking.

The relations between the Cibots and the Remonencqs were those of benefactors and recipients. Mme. Cibot, convinced that the Auvergnats were wretchedly poor, used to let them have the remainder of "her gentlemen's" dinners at ridiculous prices. The Remonencqs would buy a pound of broken bread, crusts and crumbs, for a farthing, a porringer-full of cold potatoes for something less, and other scraps in proportion. Remonencq shrewdly allowed them to believe that he was not in business on his own account, he worked for Monistrol, the rich shopkeepers preyed upon him, he said, and the Cibots felt sincerely sorry for Remonencq. The velveteen jacket, waistcoat, and trousers, particularly affected by Auvergnats, were covered with patches of Cibot's making, and not a penny had the little tailor charged for repairs which kept the three garments together after eleven years of wear. Thus we see that all Jews are not in Israel.

"You are not laughing at me, Remonencq, are you?" asked the portress. "Is it possible that M. Pons has such a fortune, living as he does? There is not a hundred francs in the place—"

"Amateursh are all like that," Remonencq remarked sententiously.

"Then do you think that my gentleman has worth of seven hundred thousand francs, eh?—"

"In pictures alone," continued Remonencq (it is needless, for the sake of clearness in the story, to give any further specimens of his frightful dialect). "If he would take fifty thousand francs for one up there that I know of, I would find the money if I had to hang myself. Do you remember those little frames full of enameled copper on crimson velvet, hanging among the portraits?... Well, those are Petitot's enamels; and there is a cabinet minister as used to be a druggist that will give three thousand francs apiece for them."

La Cibot's eyes opened wide. "There are thirty of them in the pair of frames!" she said.

"Very well, you can judge for yourself how much he is worth."

Mme. Cibot's head was swimming; she wheeled round. In a moment came the thought that she would have a legacy, she would sleep sound on old Pons' will, like the other servant-mistresses whose annuities had aroused such envy in the Marais. Her thoughts flew to some commune in the neighborhood of Paris; she saw herself strutting proudly about her house in the country, looking after her garden and poultry yard, ending her days, served like a queen, along with her poor dear Cibot, who deserved such good fortune, like all angelic creatures whom nobody knows nor appreciates.

Her abrupt, unthinking movement told Remonencq that success was sure. In the chineur's way of business—the chineur, be it explained, goes about the country picking up bargains at the expense of the ignorant—in the chineur's way of business, the one real difficulty is the problem of gaining an entrance to a house. No one can imagine the Scapin's roguery, the tricks of a Sganarelle, the wiles of a Dorine by which the chineur contrives to make a footing for himself. These comedies are as good as a play, and founded indeed on the old stock theme of the dishonesty of servants. For thirty francs in money or goods, servants, and especially country servants, will sometimes conclude a bargain on which the chineur makes a profit of a thousand or two thousand francs. If we could but know the history of such and such a service of Sevres porcelain, pate tendre, we should find that all the intellect, all the diplomatic subtlety displayed at Munster, Nimeguen, Utrecht, Ryswick, and Vienna was surpassed by the chineur. His is the more frank comedy; his methods of action fathom depths of personal interest quite as profound as any that plenipotentiaries can explore in their difficult search for any means of breaking up the best cemented alliances.

"I have set La Cibot nicely on fire," Remonencq told his sister, when she came to take up her position again on the ramshackle chair. "And now," he continued, "I shall go to consult the only man that knows, our Jew, a good sort of Jew that did not ask more than fifteen per cent of us for his money."

Remonencq had read La Cibot's heart. To will is to act with women of her stamp. Let them see the end in view; they will stick at nothing to gain it, and pass from scrupulous honesty to the last degree of scoundrelism in the twinkling of an eye. Honesty, like most dispositions of mind, is divided into two classes—negative and positive. La Cibot's honesty was of the negative order; she and her like are honest until they see their way clear to gain money belonging to somebody else. Positive honesty, the honesty of the bank collector, can wade knee-deep through temptations.





XXX


A torrent of evil thoughts invaded La Cibot's heart and brain so soon as Remonencq's diabolical suggestion opened the flood-gates of self-interest. La Cibot climbed, or, to be more accurate, fled up the stairs, opened the door on the landing, and showed a face disguised in false solicitude in the doorway of the room where Pons and Schmucke were bemoaning themselves. As soon as she came in, Schmucke made her a warning sign; for, true friend and sublime German that he was, he too had read the doctor's eyes, and he was afraid that Mme. Cibot might repeat the verdict. Mme. Cibot answered by a shake of the head indicative of deep woe.

"Well, my dear monsieur," asked she, "how are you feeling?"

She sat down on the foot of the bed, hands on hips, and fixed her eyes lovingly upon the patient; but what a glitter of metal there was in them, a terrible, tiger-like gleam if any one had watched her.

"I feel very ill," answered poor Pons. "I have not the slightest appetite left.—Oh! the world, the world!" he groaned, squeezing Schmucke's hand. Schmucke was sitting by his bedside, and doubtless the sick man was talking of the causes of his illness.—"I should have done far better to follow your advice, my good Schmucke, and dined here every day, and given up going into this society, that has fallen on me with all its weight, like a tumbril cart crushing an egg! And why?"

"Come, come, don't complain, M. Pons," said La Cibot; "the doctor told me just how it is—"

Schmucke tugged at her gown.

"And you will pull through," she continued, "only we must take great care of you. Be easy, you have a good friend beside you, and without boasting, a woman as will nurse you like a mother nurses her first child. I nursed Cibot round once when Dr. Poulain had given him over; he had the shroud up to his eyes, as the saying is, and they gave him up for dead. Well, well, you have not come to that yet, God be thanked, ill though you may be. Count on me; I would pull you through all by myself, I would! Keep still, don't you fidget like that."

She pulled the coverlet over the patient's hands as she spoke.

"There, sonny! M. Schmucke and I will sit up with you of nights. A prince won't be no better nursed... and besides, you needn't refuse yourself nothing that's necessary, you can afford it.—I have just been talking things over with Cibot, for what would he do without me, poor dear?—Well, and I talked him round; we are both so fond of you, that he will let me stop up with you of a night. And that is a good deal to ask of a man like him, for he is as fond of me as ever he was the day we were married. I don't know how it is. It is the lodge, you see; we are always there together! Don't you throw off the things like that!" she cried, making a dash for the bedhead to draw the coverlet over Pons' chest. "If you are not good, and don't do just as Dr. Poulain says—and Dr. Poulain is the image of Providence on earth—I will have no more to do with you. You must do as I tell you—"

"Yes, Montame Zipod, he vill do vat you dell him," put in Schmucke; "he vants to lif for his boor friend Schmucke's sake, I'll pe pound."

"And of all things, don't fidget yourself," continued La Cibot, "for your illness makes you quite bad enough without your making it worse for want of patience. God sends us our troubles, my dear good gentlemen; He punishes us for our sins. Haven't you nothing to reproach yourself with? some poor little bit of a fault or other?"

The invalid shook his head.

"Oh! go on! You were young once, you had your fling, there is some love-child of yours somewhere—cold, and starving, and homeless.... What monsters men are! Their love doesn't last only for a day, and then in a jiffy they forget, they don't so much as think of the child at the breast for months.... Poor women!"

"But no one has ever loved me except Schmucke and my mother," poor Pons broke in sadly.

"Oh! come, you aren't no saint! You were young in your time, and a fine-looking young fellow you must have been at twenty. I should have fallen in love with you myself, so nice as you are—"

"I always was as ugly as a toad," Pons put in desperately.

"You say that because you are modest; nobody can't say that you aren't modest."

"My dear Mme. Cibot, no, I tell you. I always was ugly, and I never was loved in my life."

"You, indeed!" cried the portress. "You want to make me believe at this time of day that you are as innocent as a young maid at your time of life. Tell that to your granny! A musician at a theatre too! Why, if a woman told me that, I wouldn't believe her."

"Montame Zipod, you irritate him!" cried Schmucke, seeing that Pons was writhing under the bedclothes.

"You hold your tongue too! You are a pair of old libertines. If you were ugly, it don't make no difference; there was never so ugly a saucepan-lid but it found a pot to match, as the saying is. There is Cibot, he got one of the handsomest oyster-women in Paris to fall in love with him, and you are infinitely better looking than him! You are a nice pair, you are! Come, now, you have sown your wild oats, and God will punish you for deserting your children, like Abraham—"

Exhausted though he was, the invalid gathered up all his strength to make a vehement gesture of denial.

"Do lie quiet; if you have, it won't prevent you from living as long as Methuselah."

"Then, pray let me be quiet!" groaned Pons. "I have never known what it is to be loved. I have had no child; I am alone in the world."

"Really, eh?" returned the portress. "You are so kind, and that is what women like, you see—it draws them—and it looked to me impossible that when you were in your prime—"

"Take her away," Pons whispered to Schmucke; "she sets my nerves on edge."

"Then there's M. Schmucke, he has children. You old bachelors are not all like that—"

"I!" cried Schmucke, springing to his feet, "vy!—"

"Come, then, you have none to come after you either, eh? You both sprung up out of the earth like mushrooms—"

"Look here, komm mit me," said Schmucke.

The good German manfully took Mme. Cibot by the waist and carried her off into the next room, in spite of her exclamations.





XXXI


"At your age, you would not take advantage of a defenceless woman!" cried La Cibot, struggling in his arms.

"Don't make a noise!"

"You too, the better one of the two!" returned La Cibot. "Ah! it is my fault for talking about love to two old men who have never had nothing to do with women. I have roused your passions," cried she, as Schmucke's eyes glittered with wrath. "Help! help! police!"

"You are a stoopid!" said the German. "Look here, vat tid de toctor say?"

"You are a ruffian to treat me so," wept La Cibot, now released,—"me that would go through fire and water for you both! Ah! well, well, they say that that is the way with men—and true it is! There is my poor Cibot, he would not be rough with me like this.... And I treated you like my children, for I have none of my own; and yesterday, yes, only yesterday I said to Cibot, 'God knew well what He was doing, dear,' I said, 'when He refused us children, for I have two children there upstairs.' By the holy crucifix and the soul of my mother, that was what I said to him—"

"Eh! but vat did der doctor say?" Schmucke demanded furiously, stamping on the floor for the first time in his life.

"Well," said Mme. Cibot, drawing Schmucke into the dining-room, "he just said this—that our dear, darling love lying ill there would die if he wasn't carefully nursed; but I am here, in spite of all your brutality, for brutal you were, you that I thought so gentle. And you are one of that sort! Ah! now, you would not abuse a woman at your age, great blackguard—"

"Placard? I? Vill you not oonderstand that I lof nopody but Bons?"

"Well and good, you will let me alone, won't you?" said she, smiling at Schmucke. "You had better; for if Cibot knew that anybody had attempted his honor, he would break every bone in his skin."

"Take crate care of him, dear Montame Zipod," answered Schmucke, and he tried to take the portress' hand.

"Oh! look here now, again."

"Chust listen to me. You shall haf all dot I haf, gif ve safe him."

"Very well; I will go round to the chemist's to get the things that are wanted; this illness is going to cost a lot, you see, sir, and what will you do?"

"I shall vork; Bons shall be nursed like ein brince."

"So he shall, M. Schmucke; and look here, don't you trouble about nothing. Cibot and I, between us, have saved a couple of thousand francs; they are yours; I have been spending money on you this long time, I have."

"Goot voman!" cried Schmucke, brushing the tears from his eyes. "Vat ein heart!"

"Wipe your tears; they do me honor; this is my reward," said La Cibot, melodramatically. "There isn't no more disinterested creature on earth than me; but don't you go into the room with tears in your eyes, or M. Pons will be thinking himself worse than he is."

Schmucke was touched by this delicate feeling. He took La Cibot's hand and gave it a final squeeze.

"Spare me!" cried the ex-oysterseller, leering at Schmucke.

"Bons," the good German said when he returned "Montame Zipod is an anchel; 'tis an anchel dat brattles, but an anchel all der same."

"Do you think so? I have grown suspicious in the past month," said the invalid, shaking his head. "After all I have been through, one comes to believe in nothing but God and my friend—"

"Get bedder, and ve vill lif like kings, all tree of us," exclaimed Schmucke.

"Cibot!" panted the portress as she entered the lodge. "Oh, my dear, our fortune is made. My two gentlemen haven't nobody to come after them, no natural children, no nothing, in short! Oh, I shall go round to Ma'am Fontaine's and get her to tell my fortune on the cards, then we shall know how much we are going to have—"

"Wife," said the little tailor, "it's ill counting on dead men's shoes."

"Oh, I say, are you going to worry me?" asked she, giving her spouse a playful tap. "I know what I know! Dr. Poulain has given up M. Pons. And we are going to be rich! My name will be down in the will.... I'll see to that. Draw your needle in and out, and look after the lodge; you will not do it for long now. We will retire, and go into the country, out at Batignolles. A nice house and a fine garden; you will amuse yourself with gardening, and I shall keep a servant!"

"Well, neighbor, and how are things going on upstairs?" Remonencq put his head in at the door. "Do you know what the collection is worth?"

"No, no, not yet. One can't go at that rate, my good man. I have begun, myself, by finding out more important things—"

"More important!" exclaimed Remonencq; "why, what things can be more important?"

"Come, let me do the steering, ragamuffin," said La Cibot au-thoritatively.

"But thirty per cent on seven hundred thousand francs," persisted the dealer in old iron; "you could be your own mistress for the rest of your days on that."

"Be easy, Daddy Remonencq; when we want to know the value of the things that the old man has got together, then we will see."





XXXII


La Cibot went for the medicine ordered by Dr. Poulain, and put off her consultation with Mme. Fontaine until the morrow; the oracle's faculties would be fresher and clearer in the morning, she thought; and she would go early, before everybody else came, for there was often a crowd at Mme. Fontaine's.

Mme. Fontaine was at this time the oracle of the Marais; she had survived the rival of forty years, the celebrated Mlle. Lenormand. No one imagines the part that fortune-tellers play among Parisians of the lower classes, nor the immense influence which they exert over the uneducated; general servants, portresses, kept women, workmen, all the many in Paris who live on hope, consult the privileged beings who possess the mysterious power of reading the future. The belief of the occult science is far more widely spread than scholars, lawyers, doctors, magistrates, and philosophers imagine. The instincts of the people are ineradicable. One among those instincts, so foolishly styled "superstition," runs in the blood of the populace, and tinges no less the intellects of better educated folk. More than one French statesman has been known to consult the fortune-teller's cards. For sceptical minds, astrology, in French, so oddly termed astrologie judiciare, is nothing more than a cunning device for making a profit out of one of the strongest of all the instincts of human nature—to wit, curiosity. The sceptical mind consequently denies that there is any connection between human destiny and the prognostications obtained by the seven or eight principal methods known to astrology; and the occult sciences, like many natural phenomena, are passed over by the freethinker or the materialist philosopher, id est, by those who believe in nothing but visible and tangible facts, in the results given by the chemist's retort and the scales of modern physical science. The occult sciences still exist; they are at work, but they make no progress, for the greatest intellects of two centuries have abandoned the field.

If you only look at the practical side of divination, it seems absurd to imagine that events in a man's past life and secrets known only to himself can be represented on the spur of the moment by a pack of cards which he shuffles and cuts for the fortune-teller to lay out in piles according to certain mysterious rules; but then the steam-engine was condemned as absurd, aerial navigation is still said to be absurd, so in their time were the inventions of gunpowder, printing, spectacles, engraving, and that latest discovery of all—the daguerréotype. If any man had come to Napoleon to tell him that a building or a figure is at all times and in all places represented by an image in the atmosphere, that every existing object has a spectral intangible double which may become visible, the Emperor would have sent his informant to Charenton for a lunatic, just as Richelieu before his day sent that Norman martyr, Salomon de Caus, to the Bicetre for announcing his immense triumph, the idea of navigation by steam. Yet Daguerre's discovery amounts to nothing more nor less than this. And if for some clairvoyant eyes God has written each man's destiny over his whole outward and visible form, if a man's body is the record of his fate, why should not the hand in a manner epitomize the body?—since the hand represents the deed of man, and by his deeds he is known. Herein lies the theory of palmistry. Does not Society imitate God? At the sight of a soldier we can predict that he will fight; of a lawyer, that he will talk; of a shoemaker, that he shall make shoes or boots; of a worker of the soil, that he shall dig the ground and dung it; and is it a more wonderful thing that such an one with the "seer's" gift should foretell the events of a man's life from his hand? To take a striking example. Genius is so visible in a man that a great artist cannot walk about the streets of Paris but the most ignorant people are conscious of his passing. He is a sun, as it were, in the mental world, shedding light that colors everything in its path. And who does not know an idiot at once by an impression the exact opposite of the sensation of the presence of genius? Most observers of human nature in general, and Parisian nature in particular, can guess the profession or calling of the man in the street. The mysteries of the witches' Sabbath, so wonderfully painted in the sixteenth century, are no mysteries for us.The Egyptian ancestors of that mysterious people of Indian origin, the gypsies of the present day, simply used to drug their clients with hashish, a practice that fully accounts for broomstick rides and flights up the chimney, the real-seeming visions, so to speak, of old crones transformed into young damsels, the frantic dances, the exquisite music, and all the fantastic tales of devil-worship.

So many proven facts have been first discovered by occult science, that some day we shall have professors of occult science, as we already have professors of chemistry and astronomy. It is even singular that here in Paris, where we are founding chairs of Mantchu and Slave and literatures so little professable (to coin a word) as the literatures of the North (which, so far from providing lessons, stand very badly in need of them); when the curriculum is full of the everlasting lectures on Shakespeare and the sixteenth century,—it is strange that some one has not restored the teaching of the occult philosophies, once the glory of the University of Paris, under the title of anthropology. Germany, so childlike and so great, has outstripped France in this particular; in Germany they have professors of a science of far more use than a knowledge of the heterogeneous philosophies, which all come to the same thing at bottom.

Once admit that certain beings have the power of discerning the future in its germ-form of the Cause, as the great inventor sees a glimpse of the industry latent in his invention, or a science in something that happens every day unnoticed by ordinary eyes—once allow this, and there is nothing to cause an outcry in such phenomena, no violent exception to nature's laws, but the operation of a recognized faculty; possibly a kind of mental somnambulism, as it were. If, therefore, the hypothesis upon which the various ways of divining the future are based seem absurd, the facts remain. Remark that it is not really more wonderful that the seer should foretell the chief events of the future than that he should read the past. Past and future, on the sceptic's system, equally lie beyond the limits of knowledge. If the past has left traces behind it, it is not improbable that future events have, as it were, their roots in the present. If a fortune-teller gives you minute details of past facts known only to yourself, why should he not foresee the events to be produced by existing causes? The world of ideas is cut out, so to speak, on the pattern of the physical world; the same phenomena should be discernible in both, allowing for the difference of the medium. As, for instance, a corporeal body actually projects an image upon the atmosphere—a spectral double detected and recorded by the daguerreotype; so also ideas, having a real and effective existence, leave an impression, as it were, upon the atmosphere of the spiritual world; they likewise produce effects, and exist spectrally (to coin a word to express phenomena for which no words exist), and certain human beings are endowed with the faculty of discerning these "forms" or traces of ideas.

As for the material means employed to assist the seer—the objects arranged by the hands of the consultant that the accidents of his life may be revealed to him,—this is the least inexplicable part of the process. Everything in the material world is part of a series of causes and effects. Nothing happens without a cause, every cause is a part of a whole, and consequently the whole leaves its impression on the slightest accident. Rabelais, the greatest mind among moderns, resuming Pythagoras, Hippocrates, Aristophanes, and Dante, pronounced three centuries ago that "man is a microcosm"—a little world. Three hundred years later, the great seer Swedenborg declared that "the world was a man." The prophet and the precursor of incredulity meet thus in the greatest of all formulas. Everything in human life is predestined, so it is also with the existence of the planet. The least event, the most futile phenomena, are all subordinate parts of a scheme. Great things, therefore, great designs, and great thoughts are of necessity reflected in the smallest actions, and that so faithfully, that should a conspirator shuffle and cut a pack of playing-cards, he will write the history of his plot for the eyes of the seer styled gypsy, fortune-teller, charlatan, or what not. If you once admit fate, which is to say, the chain of links of cause and effect, astrology has a locus standi, and becomes what it was of yore, a boundless science, requiring the same faculty of deduction by which Cuvier became so great, a faculty to be exercised spontaneously, however, and not merely in nights of study in the closet.

For seven centuries astrology and divination have exercised an influence not only (as at present) over the uneducated, but over the greatest minds, over kings and queens and wealthy people. Animal magnetism, one of the great sciences of antiquity, had its origin in occult philosophy; chemistry is the outcome of alchemy; phrenology and neurology are no less the fruit of similar studies. The first illustrious workers in these, to all appearance, untouched fields, made one mistake, the mistake of all inventors; that is to say, they erected an absolute system on a basis of isolated facts for which modern analysis as yet cannot account. The Catholic Church, the law of the land, and modern philosophy, in agreement for once, combined to prescribe, persecute, and ridicule the mysteries of the Cabala as well as the adepts; the result is a lamentable interregnum of a century in occult philosophy. But the uneducated classes, and not a few cultivated people (women especially), continue to pay a tribute to the mysterious power of those who can raise the veil of the future; they go to buy hope, strength, and courage of the fortune-teller; in other words, to ask of him all that religion alone can give. So the art is still practised in spite of a certain amount of risk. The eighteenth century encyclopaedists procured tolerance for the sorcerer; he is no longer amenable to a court of law, unless, indeed, he lends himself to fraudulent practices, and frightens his "clients" to extort money from them, in which case he may be prosecuted on a charge of obtaining money under false pretences. Unluckily, the exercise of the sublime art is only too often used as a method of obtaining money under false pretences, and for the following reasons.

The seer's wonderful gifts are usually bestowed upon those who are described by the epithets rough and uneducated. The rough and uneducated are the chosen vessels into which God pours the elixirs at which we marvel. From among the rough and uneducated, prophets arise—an Apostle Peter, or St. Peter the Hermit. Wherever mental power is imprisoned, and remains intact and entire for want of an outlet in conversation, in politics, in literature, in the imaginings of the scholar, in the efforts of the statesman, in the conceptions of the inventor, or the soldier's toils of war; the fire within is apt to flash out in gleams of marvelously vivid light, like the sparks hidden in an unpolished diamond. Let the occasion come, and the spirit within kindles and glows, finds wings to traverse space, and the god-like power of beholding all things. The coal of yesterday under the play of some mysterious influence becomes a radiant diamond. Better educated people, many-sided and highly polished, continually giving out all that is in them, can never exhibit this supreme power, save by one of the miracles which God sometimes vouchsafes to work. For this reason the soothsayer is almost always a beggar, whose mind is virgin soil, a creature coarse to all appearance, a pebble borne along the torrent of misery and left in the ruts of life, where it spends nothing of itself save in mere physical suffering. The prophet, the seer, in short, is some Martin le Laboureur making a Louis XVIII tremble by telling him a secret known only to the king himself; or it is a Mlle. Lenormand, or a domestic servant like Mme. Fontaine, or again, perhaps it is some half-idiotic negress, some herdsman living among his cattle, who receives the gift of vision; some Hindoo fakir, seated by a pagoda, mortifying the flesh till the spirit gains the mysterious power of the somnambulist.

Asia, indeed, through all time, has been the home of the heroes of occult science. Persons of this kind, recovering their normal state, are usually just as they were before. They fulfil, in some sort, the chemical and physical functions of bodies which conduct electricity; at times inert metal, at other times a channel filled with a mysterious current. In their normal condition they are given to practices which bring them before the magistrate, yea, verily, like the notorious Balthazar, even unto the criminal court, and so to the hulks. You could hardly find a better proof of the immense influence of fortune-telling upon the working classes than the fact that poor Pons' life and death hung upon the prediction that Mme. Fontaine was to make from the cards.

Although a certain amount of repetition is inevitable in a canvas so considerable and so full of detail as a complete picture of French society in the nineteenth century, it is needless to repeat the description of Mme. Fontaine's den, already given in Les Comediens sans le savoir; suffice it to say that Mme. Cibot used to go to Mme. Fontaine's house in the Rue Vieille-du-Temple as regularly as frequenters of the Cafe Anglais drop in at that restaurant for lunch. Mme. Cibot, being a very old customer, often introduced young persons and old gossips consumed with curiosity to the wise woman.





XXXIII


The old servant who acted as provost marshal flung open the door of the sanctuary with no further ceremony than the remark, "It's Mme. Cibot.—Come in, there's nobody here."

"Well, child, what can bring you here so early of a morning?" asked the sorceress, as Mme.

Fontaine might well be called, for she was seventy-eight years old, and looked like one of the Parcae.

"Something has given me a turn," said La Cibot; "I want the grand jeu; it is a question of my fortune."

Therewith she explained her position, and wished to know if her sordid hopes were likely to be realized.

"Do you know what the grand jeu means?" asked Mme. Fontaine, with much solemnity.

"No, I haven't never seen the trick, I am not rich enough.—A hundred francs! It's not as if it cost so much! Where was the money to come from? But now I can't help myself, I must have it."

"I don't do it often, child," returned Mme. Fontaine; "I only do it for rich people on great occasions, and they pay me twenty-five louis for doing it; it tires me, you see, it wears me out. The 'Spirit' rives my inside, here. It is like going to the 'Sabbath,' as they used to say."

"But when I tell you that it means my whole future, my dear good Ma'am Fontaine—"

"Well, as it is you that have come to consult me so often, I will submit myself to the Spirit!" replied Mme. Fontaine, with a look of genuine terror on her face.

She rose from her filthy old chair by the fireside, and went to a table covered with a green cloth so worn that you could count the threads. A huge toad sat dozing there beside a cage inhabited by a black disheveled-looking fowl.

"Astaroth! here, my son!" she said, and the creature looked up intelligently at her as she rapped him on the back with a long knitting-needle.—"And you, Mademoiselle Cleopatre!—attention!" she continued, tapping the ancient fowl on the beak.

Then Mme. Fontaine began to think; for several seconds she did not move; she looked like a corpse, her eyes rolled in their sockets and grew white; then she rose stiff and erect, and a cavernous voice cried: "Here I am!"

Automatically she scattered millet for Cleopatre, took up the pack of cards, shuffled them convulsively, and held them out to Mme. Cibot to cut, sighing heavily all the time.

At the sight of that image of Death in the filthy turban and uncanny-looking bed-jacket, watching the black fowl as it pecked at the millet-grains, calling to the toad Astaroth to walk over the cards that lay out on the table, a cold thrill ran through Mme. Cibot; she shuddered.

Nothing but strong belief can give strong emotions. An assured income, to be or not to be, that was the question.

The sorceress opened a magical work and muttered some unint-elligible words in a sepulchral voice, looked at the remaining millet-seeds, and watched the way in which the toad retired. Then after seven or eight minutes, she turned her white eyes on the cards and expounded them.

"You will succeed, although nothing in the affair will fall out as you expect. You will have many steps to take, but you will reap the fruits of your labors. You will behave very badly; it will be with you as it is with all those who sit by a sick-bed and covet part of the inheritance. Great people will help you in this work of wrongdoing. Afterwards in the death agony you will repent. Two escaped convicts, a short man with red hair and an old man with a bald head, will murder you for the sake of the money you will be supposed to have in the village whither you will retire with your second husband. Now, my daughter, it is still open to you to choose your course."

The excitement which seemed to glow within, lighting up the bony hollows about the eyes, was suddenly extinguished. As soon as the horoscope was pronounced, Mme. Fontaine's face wore a dazed expression; she looked exactly like a sleep-walker aroused from sleep, gazed about her with an astonished air, recognized Mme. Cibot, and seemed surprised by her terrified face.





XXXIV


"Well, child," she said, in a totally different voice, "are you satisfied?"

Mme. Cibot stared stupidly at the sorceress, and could not answer.

"Ah! you would have the grand jeu; I have treated you as an old acquaintance. I only want a hundred francs—"

"Cibot,—going to die?" gasped the portress.

"So I have been telling you very dreadful things, have I?" asked Mme. Fontaine, with an extremely ingenuous air.

"Why, yes!" said La Cibot, taking a hundred francs from her pocket and laying them down on the edge of the table. "Going to be murdered, think of it—"

"Ah! there it is! You would have the grand jeu; but don't take on so, all the folk that are murdered on the cards don't die."

"But is it possible, Ma'am Fontaine?"

"Oh, I know nothing about it, my pretty dear! You would rap at the door of the future; I pull the cord, and it came."

"It, what?" asked Mme. Cibot.

"Well, then, the Spirit!" cried the sorceress impatiently.

"Good-bye, Ma'am Fontaine," exclaimed the portress. "I did not know what the grand jeu was like. You have given me a good fright, that you have."

"The mistress will not put herself in that state twice in a month," said the servant, as she went with La Cibot to the landing. "She would do herself to death if she did, it tires her so. She will eat cutlets now and sleep for three hours afterwards."

Out in the street La Cibot took counsel of herself as she went along, and, after the manner of all who ask for advice of any sort or description, she took the favorable part of the prediction and rejected the rest. The next day found her confirmed in her resolutions—she would set all in train to become rich by securing a part of Pons' collection. Nor for some time had she any other thought than the combination of various plans to this end. The faculty of self-concentration seen in rough, uneducated persons, explained on a previous page, the reserve power accumulated in those whose mental energies are unworn by the daily wear and tear of social life, and brought into action so soon as that terrible weapon the "fixed idea" is brought into play,—all this was pre-eminently manifested in La Cibot. Even as the "fixed idea" works miracles of evasion, and brings forth prodigies of sentiment, so greed transformed the portress till she became as formidable as a Nucingen at bay, as subtle beneath her seeming stupidity as the irresistible La Palferine.

About seven o'clock one morning, a few days afterwards, she saw Remonencq taking down his shutters. She went across to him.

"How could one find out how much the things yonder in my gentlemen's rooms are worth?" she asked in a wheedling tone.

"Oh! that is quite easy," replied the owner of the old curiosity shop. "If you will play fair and above board with me, I will tell you of somebody, a very honest man, who will know the value of the pictures to a farthing—"

"Who?"

"M. Magus, a Jew. He only does business to amuse himself now."

Elie Magus has appeared so often in the Comedie Humaine, that it is needless to say more of him here. Suffice it to add that he had retired from business, and as a dealer was following the example set by Pons the amateur. Well-known valuers like Henry, Messrs. Pigeot and Moret, Theret, Georges, and Roehn, the experts of the Musee, in fact, were but children compared with Elie Magus. He could see a masterpiece beneath the accumulated grime of a century; he knew all schools, and the handwriting of all painters.

He had come to Paris from Bordeaux, and so long ago as 1835 he had retired from business without making any change for the better in his dress, so faithful is the race to old tradition. The persecutions of the Middle Ages compelled them to wear rags, to snuffle and whine and groan over their poverty in self-defence, till the habits induced by the necessities of other times have come to be, as usual, instinctive, a racial defect. Elie Magus had amassed a vast fortune by buying and selling diamonds, pictures, lace, enamels, delicate carvings, old jewelry, and rarities of all kinds, a kind of commerce which has developed enormously of late, so much so indeed that the number of dealers has increased tenfold during the last twenty years in this city of Paris, whither all the curiosities in the world come to rub against one another. And for pictures there are but three marts in the world—Rome, London, and Paris.

Elie Magus lived in the Chausee des Minimes, a short, broad street leading to the Place Royale. He had bought the house, an old-fashioned mansion, for a song, as the saying is, in 1831. Yet there were sumptuous apartments within it, decorated in the time of Louis XV; for it had once been the Hotel Maulaincourt, built by the great President of the Cour des Aides, and its remote position had saved it at the time of the Revolution. You may be quite sure that the old Jew had sound reasons for buying house property, contrary to the Hebrew law and custom. He had ended, as most of us end, with a hobby that bordered on a craze. He was as miserly as his friend, the late lamented Gobseck; but he had been caught by the snare of the eyes, by the beauty of the pictures in which he dealt. As his taste grew more and more fastidious, it became one of the passions which princes alone can indulge when they are wealthy and art-lovers. As the second King of Prussia found nothing that so kindled enthusiasm as the spectacle of a grenadier over six feet high, and gave extravagant sums for a new specimen to add to his living museum of a regiment, so the retired picture-dealer was roused to passion-pitch only by some canvas in perfect preservation, untouched since the master laid down the brush; and what was more, it must be a picture of the painter's best time. No great sales, therefore, took place but Elie Magus was there; every mart knew him; he traveled all over Europe. The ice-cold, money-worshiping soul in him kindled at the sight of a perfect work of art, precisely as a libertine, weary of fair women, is roused from apathy by the sight of a beautiful girl, and sets out afresh upon the quest of flawless loveliness. A Don Juan among fair works of art, a worshiper of the Ideal, Elie Magus had discovered joys that transcend the pleasure of a miser gloating over his gold—he lived in a seraglio of great paintings.

His masterpieces were housed as became the children of princes; the whole first floor of the great old mansion was given up to them. The rooms had been restored under Elie Magus' orders, and with what magnificence! The windows were hung with the richest Venetian brocade; the most splendid carpets from the Savonnerie covered the parquetry flooring. The frames of the pictures, nearly a hundred in number, were magnificent specimens, regilded cunningly by Servais, the one gilder in Paris whom Elie Magus thought sufficiently painstaking; the old Jew himself had taught him to use the English leaf, which is infinitely superior to that produced by French gold-beaters. Servais is among gilders as Thouvenin among bookbinders—an artist among craftsmen, making his work a labor of love. Every window in that gallery was protected by iron-barred shutters. Elie Magus himself lived in a couple of attics on the floor above; the furniture was wretched, the rooms were full of rags, and the whole place smacked of the Ghetto; Elie Magus was finishing his days without any change in his life.

The whole of the ground floor was given up to the picture trade (for the Jew still dealt in works of art). Here he stored his canvases, here also packing-cases were stowed on their arrival from other countries; and still there was room for a vast studio, where Moret, most skilful of restorers of pictures, a craftsman whom the Musee ought to employ, was almost always at work for Magus. The rest of the rooms on the ground floor were given up to Magus' daughter, the child of his old age, a Jewess as beautiful as a Jewess can be when the Semitic type reappears in its purity and nobility in a daughter of Israel. Noemi was guarded by two servants, fanatical Jewesses, to say nothing of an advanced-guard, a Polish Jew, Abramko by name, once involved in a fabulous manner in political troubles, from which Elie Magus saved him as a business speculation. Abramko, porter of the silent, grim, deserted mansion, divided his office and his lodge with three remarkably ferocious animals—an English bull-dog, a Newfoundland dog, and another of the Pyrenean breed.

Behold the profound observations of human nature upon which Elie Magus based his feeling of security, for secure he felt; he left home without misgivings, slept with both ears shut, and feared no attempt upon his daughter (his chief treasure), his pictures, or his money. In the first place, Abramko's salary was increased every year by two hundred francs so long as his master should live; and Magus, moreover, was training Abramko as a money-lender in a small way. Abramko never admitted anybody until he had surveyed them through a formidable grated opening. He was a Hercules for strength, he worshiped Elie Magus, as Sancho Panza worshiped Don Quixote. All day long the dogs were shut up without food; at nightfall Abramko let them loose; and by a cunning device the old Jew kept each animal at his post in the courtyard or the garden by hanging a piece of meat just out of reach on the top of a pole. The animals guarded the house, and sheer hunger guarded the dogs. No odor that reached their nostrils could tempt them from the neighborhood of that piece of meat; they would not have left their places at the foot of the poles for the most engaging female of the canine species. If a stranger by any chance intruded, the dogs suspected him of ulterior designs upon their rations, which were only taken down in the morning by Abramko himself when he awoke. The advantages of this fiendish scheme are patent. The animals never barked, Magus' ingenuity had made savages of them; they were treacherous as Mohicans. And now for the result. One night burglars, emboldened by the silence, decided too hastily that it would be easy enough to "clean out" the old Jew's strong box. One of their number told off to advance to the assault scrambled up the garden wall and prepared to descend. This the bull-dog allowed him to do. The animal, knowing perfectly well what was coming, waited for the burglar to reach the ground; but when that gentleman directed a kick at him, the bull-dog flew at the visitor's shins, and, making but one bite of it, snapped the ankle-bone clean in two. The thief had the courage to tear him away, and returned, walking upon the bare bone of the mutilated stump till he reached the rest of the gang, when he fell fainting, and they carried him off. The Police News, of course, did not fail to report this delightful night incident, but no one believed in it.

Magus at this time was seventy-five years old, and there was no reason why he should not live to a hundred. Rich man though he was, he lived like the Remonencqs. His necessary expenses, including the money he lavished on his daughter, did not exceed three thousand francs.





XXXV


No life could be more regular; the old man rose as soon as it was light, breakfasted on bread rubbed with a clove of garlic, and ate no more food until dinner-time. Dinner, a meal frugal enough for a convent, he took at home. All the forenoons he spent among his treasures, walking up and down the gallery where they hung in their glory. He would dust everything himself, furniture and pictures; he never wearied of admiring. Then he would go downstairs to his daughter, drink deep of a father's happiness, and start out upon his walks through Paris, to attend sales or visit exhibitions and the like. If Elie Magus found a great work of art under the right conditions, the discovery put new life into the man; here was a bit of sharp practice, a bargain to make, a battle of Marengo to win. He would pile ruse on ruse to buy the new sultana as cheaply as possible. Magus had a map of Europe on which all great pictures were marked; his co-religionists in every city spied out business for him, and received a commission on the purchase. And then, what rewards for all his pains!

The two lost Raphaels so earnestly sought after by Raphael lovers are both in his collection. Elie Magus owns the original portrait of Giorgione's Mistress, the woman for whom the painter died; the so-called originals are merely copies of the famous picture, which is worth five hundred thousand francs, according to its owner's estimation. This Jew possesses Titian's masterpiece, an Entombment painted for Charles V, sent by the great man to the great Emperor with a holograph letter, now fastened down upon the lower part of the canvas. And Magus has yet another Titian, the original sketch from which all the portraits of Philip II were painted. His remaining ninety-seven pictures are all of the same rank and distinction. Wherefore Magus laughs at our national collection, raked by the sunlight which destroys the fairest paintings, pouring in through panes of glass that act as lenses. Picture galleries can only be lighted from above; Magus opens and closes his shutters himself; he is as careful of his pictures as of his daughter, his second idol. And well the old picture-fancier knows the laws of the lives of pictures. To hear him talk, a great picture has a life of its own; it is changeable, it takes its beauty from the color of the light. Magus talks of his paintings as Dutch fanciers used to talk of their tulips; he will come home on purpose to see some one picture in the hour of its glory, when the light is bright and clean.

And Magus himself was a living picture among the motionless figures on the wall—a little old man, dressed in a shabby overcoat, a silk waistcoat, renewed twice in a score of years, and a very dirty pair of trousers, with a bald head, a face full of deep hollows, a wrinkled, callous skin, a beard that had a trick of twitching its long white bristles, a menacing pointed chin, a toothless mouth, eyes bright as the eyes of his dogs in the yard, and a nose like an obelisk—there he stood in his gallery smiling at the beauty called into being by genius. A Jew surrounded by his millions will always be one of the finest spectacles which humanity can give. Robert Medal, our great actor, cannot rise to this height of poetry, sublime though he is. Paris of all the cities of the world holds most of such men as Magus, strange beings with a strange religion in their heart of hearts. The London "eccentric" always finds that worship, like life, brings weariness and satiety in the end; the Parisian monomaniac lives cheerfully in concubinage with his crotchet to the last. Often shall you meet in Paris some Pons, some Elie Magus, dressed badly enough, with his face turned from the rising sun (like the countenance of the perpetual secretary of the Academie), apparently heeding nothing, conscious of nothing, paying no attention to shop-windows nor to fair passers-by, walking at random, so to speak, with nothing in his pockets, and to all appearance an equally empty head. Do you ask to what Parisian tribe this manner of man belongs? He is a collector, a millionaire, one of the most impassioned souls upon earth; he and his like are capable of treading the miry ways that lead to the police-court if so they may gain possession of a cup, a picture, or some such rare unpublished piece as Elie Magus once picked up one memorable day in Germany.

This was the expert to whom Remonencq with much mystery conducted La Cibot. Remonencq always asked advice of Elie Magus when he met him in the streets; and more than once Magus had lent him money through Abramko, knowing Remonencq's honesty. The Chaussee des Minimes is close to the Rue de Normandie, and the two fellow-conspirators reached the house in ten minutes.

"You will see the richest dealer in curiosities, the greatest con-noisseur in Paris," Remonencq had said.

And Mme. Cibot, therefore, was struck dumb with amazement to be confronted with a little old man in a great-coat too shabby for Cibot to mend, standing watching a painter at work upon an old picture in the chilly room on the vast ground floor. The old man's eyes, full of cold feline malignance, were turned upon her, and La Cibot shivered.

"What do you want, Remonencq?" asked this person.

"It is a question of valuing some pictures; there is nobody but you in Paris who can tell a poor tinker-fellow like me how much he may give when he has not thousands to spend, like you."

"Where is it?"

"Here is the portress of the house where the gentleman lives; she does for him, and I have arranged with her—"

"Who is the owner?"

"M. Pons!" put in La Cibot.

"Don't know the name," said Magus, with an innocent air, bringing down his foot very gently upon his artist's toes.

Moret the painter, knowing the value of Pons' collection, had looked up suddenly at the name. It was a move too hazardous to try with any one but Remonencq and La Cibot, but the Jew had taken the woman's measure at sight, and his eye was as accurate as a jeweler's scales. It was impossible that either of the couple should know how often Magus and old Pons had matched their claws. And, in truth, both rabid amateurs were jealous of each other. The old Jew had never hoped for a sight of a seraglio so carefully guarded; it seemed to him that his head was swimming. Pons' collection was the one private collection in Paris which could vie with his own. Pons' idea had occurred to Magus twenty years later; but as a dealer-amateur the door of Pons' museum had been closed to him, as for Dusommerard. Pons and Magus had at heart the same jealousy. Neither of them cared about the kind of celebrity dear to the ordinary collector. And now for Elie Magus came his chance to see the poor musician's treasures! An amateur of beauty hiding in a boudoir or a stolen glance at a mistress concealed from him by his friend might feel as Elie Magus felt at that moment. La Cibot was impressed by Remonencq's respect for this singular person; real power, moreover, even when it cannot be explained, is always felt; the portress was supple and obedient, she dropped the autocratic tone which she was wont to use in her lodge and with the tenants, accepted Magus' conditions, and agreed to admit him into Pons' museum that very day. So the enemy was to be brought into the citadel, and a stab dealt to Pons' very heart. For ten years Pons had carried his keys about with him; he had forbidden La Cibot to allow any one, no matter whom, to cross his threshold; and La Cibot had so far shared Schmucke's opinions of bric-a-brac, that she had obeyed him. The good Schmucke, by speaking of the splendors as "chimcracks," and deploring his friend's mania, had taught La Cibot to despise the old rubbish, and so secured Pons' museum from invasion for many a long year.

When Pons took to his bed, Schmucke filled his place at the theatre and gave lessons for him at his boarding-schools. He did his utmost to do the work of two; but Pons' sorrows weighing heavily upon his mind, the task took all his strength. He only saw his friend in the morning, and again at dinnertime. His pupils and the people at the theatre, seeing the poor German look so unhappy, used to ask for news of Pons; and so great was his grief, that the indifferent would make the grimaces of sensibility which Parisians are wont to reserve for the greatest calamities. The very springs of life had been attacked, the good German was suffering from Pons' pain as well as from his own. When he gave a music lesson, he spent half the time in talking of Pons, interrupting himself to wonder whether his friend felt better to-day, and the little school-girls listening heard lengthy explanations of Pons' symptoms. He would rush over to the Rue de Normandie in the interval between two lessons for the sake of a quarter of an hour with Pons. When at last he saw that their common stock was almost exhausted, when Mme. Cibot (who had done her best to swell the expenses of the illness) came to him and frightened him; then the old music-master felt that he had courage of which he never thought himself capable—courage that rose above his anguish. For the first time in his life he set himself to earn money; money was needed at home. One of the school-girl pupils, really touched by their troubles, asked Schmucke how he could leave his friend alone. "Montemoiselle," he answered, with the sublime smile of those who think no evil, "ve haf Montame Zipod, ein dreasure, montemoiselle, ein bearl! Bons is nursed like ein brince."

So while Schmucke trotted about the streets, La Cibot was mistress of the house and ruled the invalid. How should Pons superintend his self-appointed guardian angel, when he had taken no solid food for a fortnight, and lay there so weak and helpless that La Cibot was obliged to lift him up and carry him to the sofa while she made the bed?

La Cibot's visit to Elie Magus was paid (as might be expected) while Schmucke breakfasted. She came in again just as the German was bidding his friend good-bye; for since she learned that Pons possessed a fortune, she never left the old bachelor; she brooded over him and his treasures like a hen. From the depths of a comfortable easy-chair at the foot of the bed she poured forth for Pons' delectation the gossip in which women of her class excel. With Machiavelian skill, she had contrived to make Pons think that she was indispensable to him; she coaxed and she wheedled, always uneasy, always on the alert.





XXXVI


Mme. Fontaine's prophecy had frightened La Cibot; she vowed to herself that she would gain her ends by kindness. She would sleep secure on M. Pons' legacy, but her rascality should keep within the limits of the law. For ten years she had not suspected the value of Pons' collection; she had a clear record behind her of ten years of devotion, honesty, and disinterestedness; it was a magnificent investment, and now she proposed to realize. In one day, Remonencq's hint of money had hatched the serpent's egg, the craving for riches that had lain dormant within her for twenty years. Since she had cherished that craving, it had grown in force with the ferment of all the evil that lurks in the corners of the heart. How she acted upon the counsels whispered by the serpent will presently be seen.

"Well?" she asked of Schmucke, "has this cherub of ours had plenty to drink? Is he better?"

"He is not doing fery vell, tear Montame Zipod, not fery vell," said poor Schmucke, brushing away the tears from his eyes.

"Pooh! you make too much of it, my dear M. Schmucke; we must take things as we find them; Cibot might be at death's door, and I should not take it to heart as you do. Come! the cherub has a good constitution. And he has been steady, it seems, you see; you have no idea what an age sober people live. He is very ill, it is true, but with all the care I take of him, I shall bring him round. Be easy, look after your affairs, I will keep him company and see that he drinks his pints of barley water."

"Gif you vere not here, I should die of anxiety—" said Schmucke, squeezing his kind housekeeper's hand in both his own to express his confidence in her.

La Cibot wiped her eyes as she went back to the invalid's room.

"What is the matter, Mme. Cibot?" asked Pons.

"It is M. Schmucke that has upset me; he is crying as if you were dead," said she. "If you are not well, you are not so bad yet that nobody need cry over you; but it has given me such a turn! Oh dear! oh dear! how silly it is of me to get so fond of people, and to think more of you than of Cibot! For, after all, you aren't nothing to me, you are only my brother by Adam's side; and yet, whenever you are in the question, it puts me in such a taking, upon my word it does! I would cut off my hand—my left hand, of course—to see you coming and going, eating your meals, and screwing bargains out of dealers as usual. If I had had a child of my own, I think I should have loved it as I love you, eh! There, take a drink, dearie; come now, empty the glass. Drink it off, monsieur, I tell you! The first thing Dr. Poulain said was, 'If M. Pons has no mind to go to Pere Lachaise, he ought to drink as many buckets full of water in a day as an Auvergnat will sell.' So, come now, drink—"

"But I do drink, Cibot, my good woman; I drink and drink till I am deluged—"

"That is right," said the portress, as she took away the empty glass. "That is the way to get better. Dr. Poulain had another patient ill of your complaint; but he had nobody to look after him, his children left him to himself, and he died because he didn't drink enough—so you must drink, honey, you see—he died and they buried him two months ago. And if you were to die, you know, you would drag down old M. Schmucke with you, sir. He is like a child. Ah! he loves you, he does, the dear lamb of a man; no woman never loved a man like that! He doesn't care for meat nor drink; he has grown as thin as you are in the last fortnight, and you are nothing but skin and bones.—It makes me jealous to see it, for I am very fond of you; but not to that degree; I haven't lost my appetite, quite the other way; always going up and down stairs, till my legs are so tired that I drop down of an evening like a lump of lead. Here am I neglecting my poor Cibot for you; Mlle. Remonencq cooks his victuals for him, and he goes on about it and says that nothing is right! At that I tell him that one ought to put up with something for the sake of other people, and that you are so ill that I cannot leave you. In the first place, you can't afford a nurse. And before I would have a nurse here!—I have done for you these ten years; they want wine and sugar, and foot-warmers, and all sorts of comforts. And they rob their patients unless the patients leave them something in their wills. Have a nurse in here to-day, and to-morrow we should find a picture or something or other gone—"

"Oh! Mme. Cibot!" cried Pons, quite beside himself, "do not leave me! No one must touch anything—"

"I am here," said La Cibot; "so long as I have the strength I shall be here.—Be easy. There was Dr. Poulain wanting to get a nurse for you; perhaps he has his eye on your treasures. I just snubbed him, I did. 'The gentleman won't have any one but me,' I told him. 'He is used to me, and I am used to him.' So he said no more. A nurse, indeed! They are all thieves; I hate that sort of woman, I do. Here is a tale that will show you how sly they are. There was once an old gentleman—it was Dr. Poulain himself, mind you, who told me this—well, a Mme. Sabatier, a woman of thirty-six that used to sell slippers at the Palais Royal—you remember the Galerie at the Palais that they pulled down?"

Pons nodded.

"Well, at that time she had not done very well; her husband used to drink, and died of spontaneous imbustion; but she had been a fine woman in her time, truth to tell, not that it did her any good, though she had friends among the lawyers. So, being hard up, she became a monthly nurse, and lived in the Rue Barre-du-Bec. Well, she went out to nurse an old gentleman that had a disease of the lurinary guts (saving your presence); they used to tap him like an artesian well, and he needed such care that she used to sleep on a truckle-bed in the same room with him. You would hardly believe such a thing!—'Men respect nothing,' you'll tell me, 'so selfish as they are.' Well, she used to talk with him, you understand; she never left him, she amused him, she told him stories, she drew him on to talk (just as we are chatting away together now, you and I, eh?), and she found out that his nephews—the old gentleman had nephews—that his nephews were wretches; they had worried him, and final end of it, they had brought on this illness. Well, my dear sir, she saved his life, he married her, and they have a fine child; Ma'am Bordevin, the butcher's wife in the Rue Charlot, a relative of hers, stood godmother.There is luck for you! As for me, I am married; and if I have no children, I don't mind saying that it is Cibot's fault; he is too fond of me, but if I cared—never mind. What would have become of me and my Cibot if we had had a family, when we have not a penny to bless ourselves with after thirty years' of faithful service? I have not a farthing belonging to nobody else, that is what comforts me. I have never wronged nobody.—Look here, suppose now (there is no harm in supposing when you will be out and about again in six weeks' time, and sauntering along the boulevard); well, suppose that you had put me down in your will; very good, I shouldn't never rest till I had found your heirs and given the money back. Such is my horror of anything that is not earned by the sweat of my brow. You will say to me, 'Why, Mme. Cibot, why should you worry yourself like that? You have fairly earned the money; you looked after your two gentlemen as if they had been your children; you saved them a thousand francs a year—' (for there are plenty, sir, you know, that would have had their ten thousand francs put out to interest by now if they had been in my place)—'so if the worthy gentleman leaves you a trifle of an annuity, it is only right.'—Suppose they told me that. Well, now; I am not thinking of myself.—I cannot think how some women can do a kindness thinking of themselves all the time. It is not doing good, sir, is it? I do not go to church myself, I haven't the time; but my conscience tells me what is right.... Don't you fidget like that, my lamb!—Don't scratch yourself!... Dear me, how yellow you grow! So yellow you are—quite brown. How funny it is that one can come to look like a lemon in three weeks!... Honesty is all that poor folk have, and one must surely have something! Suppose that you were just at death's door, I should be the first to tell you that you ought to leave all that you have to M. Schmucke. It is your duty, for he is all the family you have. He loves you, he does, as a dog loves his master."

"Ah! yes," said Pons; "nobody else has ever loved me all my life long—"





XXXVII


"Ah! that is not kind of you, sir," said Mme. Cibot; "then I do not love you, I suppose?"

"I do not say so, my dear Mme. Cibot."

"Good. You take me for a servant, do you, a common servant, as if I hadn't no heart! Goodness me! for eleven years you do for two old bachelors, you think of nothing but their comfort. I have turned half a score of greengrocers' shops upside down for you, I have talked people round to get you good Brie cheese; I have gone down as far as the market for fresh butter for you; I have taken such care of things that nothing of yours hasn't been chipped nor broken in all these ten years; I have just treated you like my own children; and then to hear a 'My dear Mme. Cibot,' that shows that there is not a bit of feeling for you in the heart of an old gentleman that you have cared for like a king's son! for the little King of Rome was not so well looked after. He died in his prime; there is proof for you.... Come, sir, you are unjust! You are ungrateful! It is because I am only a poor portress. Goodness me! are you one of those that think we are dogs?—"

"But, my dear Mme. Cibot—"

"Indeed, you that know so much, tell me why we porters are treated like this, and are supposed to have no feelings; people look down on us in these days when they talk of Equality!—As for me, am I not as good as another woman, I that was one of the finest women in Paris, and was called La belle Ecaillere, and received declarations seven or eight times a day? And even now if I liked—Look here, sir, you know that little scrubby marine store-dealer downstairs? Very well, he would marry me any day, if I were a widow that is, with his eyes shut; he has had them looking wide open in my direction so often; he is always saying, 'Oh! what fine arms you have, Ma'am Cibot!—I dreamed last night that it was bread and I was butter, and I was spread on the top.' Look, sir, there is an arm!"

She rolled up her sleeve and displayed the shapeliest arm imaginable, as white and fresh as her hand was red and rough; a plump, round, dimpled arm, drawn from its merino sheath like a blade from the scabbard to dazzle Pons, who looked away.

"For every oyster the knife opened, the arm has opened a heart! Well, it belongs to Cibot, and I did wrong when I neglected him, poor dear, HE would throw himself over a precipice at a word from me; while you, sir, that call me 'My dear Mme. Cibot' when I do impossible things for you—"

"Do just listen to me," broke in the patient; "I cannot call you my mother, nor my wife—"

"No, never in all my born days will I take again to anybody—"

"Do let me speak!" continued Pons. "Let me see; I put M. Schmucke first—"

"M. Schmucke! there is a heart for you," cried La Cibot. "Ah! he loves me, but then he is poor. It is money that deadens the heart; and you are rich! Oh, well, take a nurse, you will see what a life she will lead you; she will torment you, you will be like a cockchafer on a string. The doctor will say that you must have plenty to drink, and she will do nothing but feed you. She will bring you to your grave and rob you. You do not deserve to have a Mme. Cibot!—there! When Dr. Poulain comes, ask him for a nurse."

"Oh fiddlestickend!" the patient cried angrily. "Will you listen to me? When I spoke of my friend Schmucke, I was not thinking of women. I know quite well that no one cares for me so sincerely as you do, you and Schmucke—"

"Have the goodness not to irritate yourself in this way!" exclaimed La Cibot, plunging down upon Pons and covering him by force with the bedclothes.

"How should I not love you?" said poor Pons.

"You love me, really?... There, there, forgive me, sir!" she said, crying and wiping her eyes. "Ah, yes, of course, you love me, as you love a servant, that is the way!—a servant to whom you throw an annuity of six hundred francs like a crust you fling into a dog's kennel—"

"Oh! Mme. Cibot," cried Pons, "for what do you take me? You do not know me."

"Ah! you will care even more than that for me," she said, meeting Pons' eyes. "You will love your kind old Cibot like a mother, will you not? A mother, that is it! I am your mother; you are both of you my children.... Ah, if I only knew them that caused you this sorrow, I would do that which would bring me into the police-courts, and even to prison; I would tear their eyes out! Such people deserve to die at the Barriere Saint-Jacques, and that is too good for such scoundrels.... So kind, so good as you are (for you have a heart of gold), you were sent into the world to make some woman happy!... Yes, you would have her happy, as anybody can see; you were cut out for that. In the very beginning, when I saw how you were with M. Schmucke, I said to myself, 'M. Pons has missed the life he was meant for; he was made to be a good husband.' Come, now, you like women."

"Ah, yes," said Pons, "and no woman has been mine."

"Really?" exclaimed La Cibot, with a provocative air as she came nearer and took Pons' hand in hers. "Do you not know what it is to love a woman that will do anything for her lover? Is it possible? If I were in your place, I should not wish to leave this world for another until I had known the greatest happiness on earth!... Poor dear! If I was now what I was once, I would leave Cibot for you! upon my word, I would! Why, with a nose shaped like that—for you have a fine nose—how did you manage it, poor cherub?... You will tell me that 'not every woman knows a man when she sees him;' and a pity it is that they marry so at random as they do, it makes you sorry to see it.—Now, for my own part, I should have thought that you had had mistresses by the dozen—dancers, actresses, and duchesses, for you went out so much.... When you went out, I used to say to Cibot, 'Look! there is M. Pons going a-gallivanting,' on my word, I did, I was so sure that women ran after you. Heaven made you for love.... Why, my dear sir, I found that out the first day that you dined at home, and you were so touched with M. Schmucke's pleasure. And next day M. Schmucke kept saying to me, 'Montame Zipod, he haf tined hier,' with the tears in his eyes, till I cried along with him like a fool, as I am. And how sad he looked when you took to gadding abroad again and dining out! Poor man, you never saw any one so disconsolate! Ah! you are quite right to leave everything to him. Dear worthy man, why he is as good as a family to you, he is! Do not forget him; for if you do, God will not receive you into his Paradise, for those that have been ungrateful to their friends and left them no rentes will not go to heaven."





XXXVIII


In vain Pons tried to put in a word; La Cibot talked as the wind blows. Means of arresting steam-engines have been invented, but it would tax a mechanician's genius to discover any plan for stopping a portress' tongue.

"I know what you mean," continued she. "But it does not kill you, my dear gentleman, to make a will when you are out of health; and in your place I might not leave that poor dear alone, for fear that something might happen; he is like God Almighty's lamb, he knows nothing about nothing, and I should not like him to be at the mercy of those sharks of lawyers and a wretched pack of relations. Let us see now, has one of them come here to see you in twenty years? And would you leave your property to them? Do you know, they say that all these things here are worth something."

"Why, yes," said Pons.

"Remonencq, who deals in pictures, and knows that you are an amateur, says that he would be quite ready to pay you an annuity of thirty thousand francs so long as you live, to have the pictures afterwards.... There is a change! If I were you, I should take it. Why, I thought he said it for a joke when he told me that. You ought to let M. Schmucke know the value of all those things, for he is a man that could be cheated like a child. He has not the slightest idea of the value of these fine things that you have! He so little suspects it, that he would give them away for a morsel of bread if he did not keep them all his life for love of you, always supposing that he lives after you, for he will die of your death. But I am here; I will take his part against anybody and everybody!... I and Cibot will defend him."

"Dear Mme. Cibot!" said Pons, "what would have become of me if it had not been for you and Schmucke?" He felt touched by this horrible prattle; the feeling in it seemed to be ingenuous, as it usually is in the speech of the people.

"Ah! we really are your only friends on earth, that is very true, that is. But two good hearts are worth all the families in the world.—Don't talk of families to me! A family, as the old actor said of the tongue, is the best and the worst of all things.... Where are those relations of yours now? Have you any? I have never seen them—"

"They have brought me to lie here," said Pons, with intense bitterness.

"So you have relations!..." cried La Cibot, springing up as if her easy-chair had been heated red-hot. "Oh, well, they are a nice lot, are your relations! What! these three weeks—for this is the twentieth day, to-day, that you have been ill and like to die—in these three weeks they have not come once to ask for news of you? That's a trifle too strong, that is!... Why, in your place, I would leave all I had to the Foundling Hospital sooner than give them one farthing!"

"Well, my dear Mme. Cibot, I meant to leave all that I had to a cousin once removed, the daughter of my first cousin, President Camusot, you know, who came here one morning nearly two months ago."

"Oh! a little stout man who sent his servants to beg your pardon—for his wife's blunder?—The housemaid came asking me questions about you, an affected old creature she is, my fingers itched to give her velvet tippet a dusting with my broom handle! A servant wearing a velvet tippet! did anybody ever see the like? No, upon my word, the world is turned upside down; what is the use of making a Revolution? Dine twice a day if you can afford it, you scamps of rich folk! But laws are no good, I tell you, and nothing will be safe if Louis-Philippe does not keep people in their places; for, after all, if we are all equal, eh, sir? a housemaid didn't ought to have a velvet tippet, while I, Mme. Cibot, haven't one, after thirty years of honest work.—There is a pretty thing for you! People ought to be able to tell who you are. A housemaid is a housemaid, just as I myself am a portress. Why do they have silk epaulettes in the army? Let everybody keep their place. Look here, do you want me to tell you what all this comes to? Very well, France is going to the dogs.... If the Emperor had been here, things would have been very different, wouldn't they, sir?... So I said to Cibot, I said, 'See here, Cibot, a house where the servants wear velvet tippets belongs to people that have no heart in them—'"

"No heart in them, that is just it," repeated Pons.

And with that he began to tell Mme. Cibot about his troubles and mortifications, she pouring out abuse of the relations the while and showing exceeding tenderness on every fresh sentence in the sad history. She fairly wept at last.

To understand the sudden intimacy between the old musician and Mme. Cibot, you have only to imagine the position of an old bachelor lying on his bed of pain, seriously ill for the first time in his life. Pons felt that he was alone in the world; the days that he spent by himself were all the longer because he was struggling with the indefinable nausea of a liver complaint which blackens the brightest life. Cut off from all his many interests, the sufferer falls a victim to a kind of nostalgia; he regrets the many sights to be seen for nothing in Paris.

The isolation, the darkened days, the suffering that affects the mind and spirits even more than the body, the emptiness of the life,—all these things tend to induce him to cling to the human being who waits on him as a drowned man clings to a plank; and this especially if the bachelor patient's character is as weak as his nature is sensitive and incredulous. Pons was charmed to hear La Cibot's tittle-tattle. Schmucke, Mme. Cibot, and Dr. Poulain meant all humanity to him now, when his sickroom became the universe. If invalid's thoughts, as a rule, never travel beyond in the little space over which his eyes can wander; if their selfishness, in its narrow sphere, subordinates all creatures and all things to itself, you can imagine the lengths to which an old bachelor may go. Before three weeks were out he had even gone so far as to regret, once and again, that he had not married Madeleine Vivet! Mme. Cibot, too, had made immense progress in his esteem in those three weeks; without her he felt that he should have been utterly lost; for as for Schmucke, the poor invalid looked upon him as a second Pons. La Cibot's prodigious art consisted in expressing Pons' own ideas, and this she did quite unconsciously.

"Ah! here comes the doctor!" she exclaimed, as the bell rang, and away she went, knowing very well that Remonencq had come with the Jew.

"Make no noise, gentlemen," said she, "he must not know anything. He is all on the fidget when his precious treasures are concerned."

"A walk round will be enough," said the Hebrew, armed with a magnifying-glass and a lorgnette.





XXXIX


The greater part of Pons' collection was installed in a great old-fashioned salon such as French architects used to build for the old noblesse; a room twenty-five feet broad, some thirty feet in length, and thirteen in height. Pons' pictures to the number of sixty-seven hung upon the white-and-gold paneled walls; time, however, had reddened the gold and softened the white to an ivory tint, so that the whole was toned down, and the general effect subordinated to the effect of the pictures. Fourteen statues stood on pedestals set in the corners of the room, or among the pictures, or on brackets inlaid by Boule; sideboards of carved ebony, royally rich, surrounded the walls to elbow height, all the shelves filled with curiosities; in the middle of the room stood a row of carved credence-tables, covered with rare miracles of handicraft—with ivories and bronzes, wood-carvings and enamels, jewelry and porcelain.

As soon as Elie Magus entered the sanctuary, he went straight to the four masterpieces; he saw at a glance that these were the gems of Pons' collection, and masters lacking in his own. For Elie Magus these were the naturalist's desiderata for which men undertake long voyages from east to west, through deserts and tropical countries, across southern savannahs, through virgin forests.

The first was a painting by Sebastian del Piombo, the second a Fra Bartolommeo della Porta, the third a Hobbema landscape, and the fourth and last a Durer—a portrait of a woman. Four diamonds indeed! In the history of art, Sebastian del Piombo is like a shining point in which three schools meet, each bringing its pre-eminent qualities. A Venetian painter, he came to Rome to learn the manner of Raphael under the direction of Michael Angelo, who would fain oppose Raphael on his own ground by pitting one of his own lieutenants against the reigning king of art. And so it came to pass that in Del Piombo's indolent genius Venetian color was blended with Florentine composition and a something of Raphael's manner in the few pictures which he deigned to paint, and the sketches were made for him, it is said, by Michael Angelo himself. If you would see the perfection to which the painter attained (armed as he was with triple power), go to the Louvre and look at the Baccio Bandinelli portrait; you might place it beside Titian's Man with a Glove, or by that other Portrait of an Old Man in which Raphael's consummate skill blends with Correggio's art; or, again, compare it with Leonardo da Vinci's Charles VIII, and the picture would scarcely lose. The four pearls are equal; there is the same lustre and sheen, the same rounded completeness, the same brilliancy. Art can go no further than this. Art has risen above Nature, since Nature only gives her creatures a few brief years of life. Pons possessed one example of this immortal great genius and incurably indolent painter; it was a Knight of Malta, a Templar kneeling in prayer. The picture was painted on slate, and in its unfaded color and its finish was immeasurably finer than the Baccio Bandinelli. Fra Bartolommeo was represented by a Holy Family, which many connoisseurs might have taken for a Raphael. The Hobbema would have fetched sixty thousand francs at a public sale; and as for the Durer, it was equal to the famous Holzschuer portrait at Nuremberg for which the kings of Bavaria, Holland, and Prussia have vainly offered two hundred thousand francs again and again. Was it the portrait of the wife or the daughter of Holzschuer, Albrecht Durer's personal friend?—The hypothesis seems to be a certainty, for the attitude of the figure in Pons' picture suggests that it is meant for a pendant, the position of the coat-of-arms is the same as in the Nuremberg portrait; and, finally, the oetatis suoe XLI accords perfectly with the age inscribed on the picture religiously kept by the Holzschuers of Nuremberg, and but recently engraved.

The tears stood in Elie Magus' eyes as he looked from one masterpiece to another.

He turned round to La Cibot, "I will give you a commission of two thousand francs on each of the pictures if you can arrange that I shall have them for forty thousand francs," he said. La Cibot was amazed at this good fortune dropped from the sky.

Admiration, or, to be more accurate, delirious joy, had wrought such havoc in the Jew's brain, that it had actually unsettled his habitual greed, and he fell headlong into enthusiasm, as you see.

"And I?——" put in Remonencq, who knew nothing about pictures.

"Everything here is equally good," the Jew said cunningly, lowering his voice for Remonencq's ears; "take ten pictures just as they come and on the same conditions. Your fortune will be made."

Again the three thieves looked each other in the face, each one of them overcome with the keenest of all joys—sated greed. All of a sudden the sick man's voice rang through the room; the tones vibrated like the strokes of a bell:

"Who is there?" called Pons.

"Monsieur! just go back to bed!" exclaimed La Cibot, springing upon Pons and dragging him by main force. "What next! Have you a mind to kill yourself?—Very well, then, it is not Dr. Poulain, it is Remonencq, good soul, so anxious that he has come to ask after you!—Everybody is so fond of you that the whole house is in a flutter. So what is there to fear?"

"It seems to me that there are several of you," said Pons.

"Several? that is good! What next! Are you dreaming!—You will go off your head before you have done, upon my word!—Here, look!"—and La Cibot flung open the door, signed to Magus to go, and beckoned to Remonencq.

"Well, my dear sir," said the Auvergnat, now supplied with something to say, "I just came to ask after you, for the whole house is alarmed about you.—Nobody likes Death to set foot in a house!—And lastly, Daddy Monistrol, whom you know very well, told me to tell you that if you wanted money he was at your service——"

"He sent you here to take a look round at my knick-knacks!" returned the old collector from his bed; and the sour tones of his voice were full of suspicion.

A sufferer from liver complaint nearly always takes momentary and special dislikes to some person or thing, and concentrates all his ill-humor upon the object. Pons imagined that some one had designs upon his precious collection; the thought of guarding it became a fixed idea with him; Schmucke was continually sent to see if any one had stolen into the sanctuary.

"Your collection is fine enough to attract the attention of chineurs," Remonencq answered astutely. "I am not much in the art line myself; but you are supposed to be such a great connoisseur, sir, that with my eyes shut—supposing, for instance, that you should need money some time or other, for nothing costs so much as these confounded illnesses; there was my sister now, when she would have got better again just as well without. Doctors are rascals that take advantage of your condition to—"

"Thank you, good-day, good-day," broke in Pons, eying the marine store-dealer uneasily.

"I will go to the door with him, for fear he should touch something," La Cibot whispered to her patient.

"Yes, yes," answered the invalid, thanking her by a glance.

La Cibot shut the bedroom door behind her, and Pons' suspicions awoke again at once. She found Magus standing motionless before the four pictures. His immobility, his admiration, can only be understood by other souls open to ideal beauty, to the ineffable joy of beholding art made perfect; such as these can stand for whole hours before the Antiope—Correggio's masterpiece—before Leonardo's Gioconda, Titian's Mistress, Andrea del Sarto's Holy Family, Domenichino's Children Among the Flowers, Raphael's little cameo, or his Portrait of an Old Man—Art's greatest masterpieces.

"Be quick and go, and make no noise," said La Cibot.

The Jew walked slowly backwards, giving the pictures such a farewell gaze as a lover gives his love.

Outside on the landing, La Cibot tapped his bony arm. His rapt contemplations had put an idea into her head.

"Make it four thousand francs for each picture," said she, "or I do nothing."

"I am so poor!..." began Magus. "I want the pictures simply for their own sake, simply and solely for the love of art, my dear lady."

"I can understand that love, sonny, you are so dried up. But if you do not promise me sixteen thousand francs now, before Remonencq here, I shall want twenty to-morrow."

"Sixteen; I promise," returned the Jew, frightened by the woman's rapacity.

La Cibot turned to Remonencq. "What oath can a Jew swear?" she inquired.

"You may trust him," replied the marine store-dealer. "He is as honest as I am."

"Very well; and you?" asked she, "if I get him to sell them to you, what will you give me?"

"Half-share of profits," Remonencq answered briskly.

"I would rather have a lump sum," returned La Cibot; "I am not in business myself."

"You understand business uncommonly well!" put in Elie Magus, smiling; "a famous saleswoman you would make!"

"I want her to take me into partnership, me and my goods," said the Auvergnat, as he took La Cibot's plump arm and gave it playful taps like hammer-strokes. "I don't ask her to bring anything into the firm but her good looks! You are making a mistake when your stick to your Turk of a Cibot and his needle. Is a little bit of a porter the man to make a woman rich—a fine woman like you? Ah, what a figure you would make in a shop on the boulevard, all among the curiosities, gossiping with amateurs and twisting them round your fingers! Just you leave your lodge as soon as you have lined your purse here, and you shall see what will become of us both."

"Lined my purse!" cried Cibot. "I am incapable of taking the worth of a single pin; you mind that, Remonencq! I am known in the neighborhood for an honest woman, I am."

La Cibot's eyes flashed fire.

"There, never mind," said Elie Magus; "this Auvergnat seems to be too fond of you to mean to insult you."

"How she would draw on the customers!" cried the Auvergnat.

Mme. Cibot softened at this. "Be fair, sonnies," quoth she, "and judge for yourselves how I am placed. These ten years past I have been wearing my life out for these two old bachelors yonder, and neither or them has given me anything but words. Remonencq will tell you that I feed them by contract, and lose twenty or thirty sous a day; all my savings have gone that way, by the soul of my mother (the only author of my days that I ever knew), this is as true as that I live, and that this is the light of day, and may my coffee poison me if I lie about a farthing. Well, there is one up there that will die soon, eh? and he the richer of the two that I have treated like my own children. Would you believe it, my dear sir, I have told him over and over again for days past that he is at death's door (for Dr. Poulain has given him up), he could not say less about putting my name down in his will. We shall only get our due by taking it, upon my word, as an honest woman, for as for trusting to the next-of-kin!—No fear! There! look you here, words don't stink; it is a bad world!"

"That is true," Elie Magus answered cunningly, "that is true; and it is just the like of us that are among the best," he added, looking at Remonencq.

"Just let me be," returned La Cibot; "I am not speaking of you. 'Pressing company is always accepted,' as the old actor said. I swear to you that the two gentlemen already owe me nearly three thousand francs; the little I have is gone by now in medicine and things on their account; and now suppose they refuse to recognize my advances? I am so stupidly honest that I did not dare to say nothing to them about it. Now, you that are in business, my dear sir, do you advise me to got to a lawyer?"

"A lawyer?" cried Remonencq; "you know more about it than all the lawyers put together—"

Just at that moment a sound echoed in the great staircase, a sound as if some heavy body had fallen in the dining-room.

"Oh, goodness me!" exclaimed La Cibot; "it seems to me that monsieur has just taken a ticket for the ground floor."

She pushed her fellow-conspirators out at the door, and while the pair descended the stairs with remarkable agility, she ran to the dining-room, and there beheld Pons, in his shirt, stretched out upon the tiles. He had fainted. She lifted him as if he had been a feather, carried him back to his room, laid him in bed, burned feathers under his nose, bathed his temples with eau-de-cologne, and at last brought him to consciousness. When she saw his eyes unclose and life return, she stood over him, hands on hips.

"No slippers! In your shirt! That is the way to kill yourself! Why do you suspect me?—If this is to be the way of it, I wish you good-day, sir. Here have I served you these ten years, I have spent money on you till my savings are all gone, to spare trouble to that poor M. Schmucke, crying like a child on the stairs—and this is my reward! You have been spying on me. God has punished you! It serves you right! Here I am straining myself to carry you, running the risk of doing myself a mischief that I shall feel all my days. Oh dear, oh dear! and the door left open too—"

"You were talking with some one. Who was it?"

"Here are notions!" cried La Cibot. "What next! Am I your bond-slave? Am I to give account of myself to you? Do you know that if you bother me like this, I shall clear out! You shall take a nurse."

Frightened by this threat, Pons unwittingly allowed La Cibot to see the extent of the power of her sword of Damocles.

"It is my illness!" he pleaded piteously.

"It is as you please," La Cibot answered roughly.

She went. Pons, confused, remorseful, admiring his nurse's scalding devotion, reproached himself for his behavior. The fall on the paved floor of the dining-room had shaken and bruised him, and aggravated his illness, but Pons was scarcely conscious of his physical sufferings.





XLI


La Cibot met Schmucke on the staircase.

"Come here, sir," she said. "There is bad news, that there is! M. Pons is going off his head! Just think of it! he got up with nothing on, he came after me—and down he came full-length. Ask him why—he knows nothing about it. He is in a bad way. I did nothing to provoke such violence, unless, perhaps, I waked up ideas by talking to him of his early amours. Who knows men? Old libertines that they are. I ought not to have shown him my arms when his eyes were glittering like carbuckles."

Schmucke listened. Mme. Cibot might have been talking Hebrew for anything that he understood.

"I have given myself a wrench that I shall feel all my days," added she, making as though she were in great pain. (Her arms did, as a matter of fact, ache a little, and the muscular fatigue suggested an idea, which she proceeded to turn to profit.) "So stupid I am. When I saw him lying there on the floor, I just took him up in my arms as if he had been a child, and carried him back to bed, I did. And I strained myself, I can feel it now. Ah! how it hurts!—I am going downstairs. Look after our patient. I will send Cibot for Dr. Poulain. I had rather die outright than be crippled."

La Cibot crawled downstairs, clinging to the banisters, and writhing and groaning so piteously that the tenants, in alarm, came out upon their landings. Schmucke supported the suffering creature, and told the story of La Cibot's devotion, the tears running down his cheeks as he spoke. Before very long the whole house, the whole neighborhood indeed, had heard of Mme. Cibot's heroism; she had given herself a dangerous strain, it was said, with lifting one of the "nutcrackers." Schmucke meanwhile went to Pons' bedside with the tale. Their factotum was in a frightful state. "What shall we do without her?" they said, as they looked at each other; but Pons was so plainly the worse for his escapade, that Schmucke did not dare to scold him.

"Gonfounded pric-a-prac! I would sooner purn dem dan loose mein friend!" he cried, when Pons told him of the cause of the accident. "To suspect Montame Zipod, dot lend us her safings! It is not goot; but it is der illness—"

"Ah! what an illness! I am not the same man, I can feel it," said Pons. "My dear Schmucke, if only you did not suffer through me!"

"Scold me," Schmucke answered, "und leaf Montame Zipod in beace."

As for Mme. Cibot, she soon recovered in Dr. Poulain's hands; and her restoration, bordering on the miraculous, shed additional lustre on her name and fame in the Marais. Pons attributed the success to the excellent constitution of the patient, who resumed her ministrations seven days later to the great satisfaction of her two gentlemen. Her influence in their household and her tyranny was increased a hundred-fold by the accident. In the course of a week, the two nutcrackers ran into debt; Mme. Cibot paid the outstanding amounts, and took the opportunity to obtain from Schmucke (how easily!) a receipt for two thousand francs, which she had lent, she said, to the friends.

"Oh, what a doctor M. Poulain is!" cried La Cibot, for Pons' benefit. "He will bring you through, my dear sir, for he pulled me out of my coffin! Cibot, poor man, thought I was dead.... Well, Dr. Poulain will have told you that while I was in bed I thought of nothing but you. 'God above,' said I, 'take me, and let my dear Mr. Pons live—'"

"Poor dear Mme. Cibot, you all but crippled yourself for me."

"Ah! but for Dr. Poulain I should have been put to bed with a shovel by now, as we shall all be one day. Well, what must be, must, as the old actor said. One must take things philosophically. How did you get on without me?"

"Schmucke nursed me," said the invalid; "but our poor money-box and our lessons have suffered. I do not know how he managed."

"Calm yourself, Bons," exclaimed Schmucke; "ve haf in Zipod ein panker—"

"Do not speak of it, my lamb. You are our children, both of you," cried La Cibot. "Our savings will be well invested; you are safer than the Bank. So long as we have a morsel of bread, half of it is yours. It is not worth mentioning—"

"Boor Montame Zipod!" said Schmucke, and he went.

Pons said nothing. "Would you believe it, my cherub?" said La Cibot, as the sick man tossed uneasily, "in my agony—for it was a near squeak for me—the thing that worried me most was the thought that I must leave you alone, with no one to look after you, and my poor Cibot without a farthing.... My savings are such a trifle, that I only mention them in connection with my death and Cibot, an angel that he is! No. He nursed me as if I had been a queen, he did, and cried like a calf over me!... But I counted on you, upon my word. I said to him, 'There, Cibot! my gentlemen will not let you starve—'"

Pons made no reply to this thrust ad testamentum; but as the portress waited for him to say something—

"I shall recommend you to M. Schmucke," he said at last.

"Ah!" cried La Cibot, "whatever you do will be right; I trust in you and your heart. Let us never talk of this again; you make me feel ashamed, my cherub. Think of getting better, you will outlive us all yet."

Profound uneasiness filled Mme. Cibot's mind. She cast about for some way of making the sick man understand that she expected a legacy. That evening, when Schmucke was eating his dinner as usual by Pons' bedside, she went out, hoping to find Dr. Poulain at home.





XLII


Dr. Poulain lived in the Rue d'Orleans in a small ground floor establishment, consisting of a lobby, a sitting-room, and two bedrooms. A closet, opening into the lobby and the bedroom, had been turned into a study for the doctor. The kitchen, the servant's bedroom, and a small cellar were situated in a wing of the house, a huge pile built in the time of the Empire, on the site of an old mansion of which the garden still remained, though it had been divided among the three ground floor tenants.

Nothing had been changed in the doctor's house since it was built. Paint and paper and ceilings were all redolent of the Empire. The grimy deposits of forty years lay thick on walls and ceilings, on paper and paint and mirrors and gilding. And yet, this little establishment, in the depths of the Marais, paid a rent of a thousand francs. Mme. Poulain, the doctor's mother, aged sixty-seven, was ending her days in the second bedroom. She worked for a breeches-maker, stitching men's leggings, breeches, belts, and braces, anything, in fact, that is made in a way of business which has somewhat fallen off of late years. Her whole time was spent in keeping her son's house and superintending the one servant; she never went abroad, and took the air in the little garden entered through the glass door of the sitting-room. Twenty years previously, when her husband died, she sold his business to his best workman, who gave his master's widow work enough to earn a daily wage of thirty sous. She had made every sacrifice to educate her son. At all costs, he should occupy a higher station than his father before him; and now she was proud of her Aesculapius, she believed in him, and sacrificed everything to him as before. She was happy to take care of him, to work and put by a little money, and dream of nothing but his welfare, and love him with an intelligent love of which every mother is not capable. For instance, Mme. Poulain remembered that she had been a working girl. She would not injure her son's prospects;he should not be ashamed by his mother (for the good woman's grammar was something of the same kind as Mme. Cibot's); and for this reason she kept in the background, and went to her room of her own accord if any distinguished patient came to consult the doctor, or if some old schoolfellow or fellow-student chanced to call. Dr. Poulain had never had occasion to blush for the mother whom he revered; and this sublime love of hers more than atoned for a defective education. The breeches-maker's business sold for about twenty thousand francs, and the widow invested the money in the Funds in 1820. The income of eleven hundred francs per annum derived from this source was, at one time, her whole fortune. For many a year the neighbors used to see the doctor's linen hanging out to dry upon a clothes-line in the garden, and the servant and Mme. Poulain thriftily washed everything at home; a piece of domestic economy which did not a little to injure the doctor's practice, for it was thought that if he was so poor, it must be through his own fault. Her eleven hundred francs scarcely did more than pay the rent. During those early days, Mme. Poulain, good, stout, little old woman, was the breadwinner, and the poor household lived upon her earnings. After twelve years of perseverance upon a rough and stony road, Dr. Poulain at last was making an income of three thousand francs, and Mme. Poulain had an income of about five thousand francs at her disposal. Five thousand francs for those who know Paris means a bare subsistence.

The sitting-room, where patients waited for an interview, was shabbily furnished. There was the inevitable mahogany sofa covered with yellow-flowered Utrecht velvet, four easy-chairs, a tea-table, a console, and half-a-dozen chairs, all the property of the deceased breeches-maker, and chosen by him. A lyre-shaped clock between two Egyptian candlesticks still preserved its glass shade intact. You asked yourself how the yellow chintz window-curtains, covered with red flowers, had contrived to hang together for so long; for evidently they had come from the Jouy factory, and Oberkampf received the Emperor's congratulations upon similar hideous productions of the cotton industry in 1809. The doctor's consulting-room was fitted up in the same style, with household stuff from the paternal chamber. It looked stiff, poverty-stricken, and bare. What patient could put faith in the skill of any unknown doctor who could not even furnish his house? And this in a time when advertising is all-powerful; when we gild the gas-lamps in the Place de la Concorde to console the poor man for his poverty by reminding him that he is rich as a citizen.

The ante-chamber did duty as a dining-room. The servant sat at her sewing there whenever she was not busy in the kitchen or keeping the doctor's mother company. From the dingy short curtains in the windows you would have guessed at the shabby thrift behind them without setting foot in the dreary place. What could those wall-cupboards contain but stale scraps of food, chipped earthenware, corks used over and over again indefinitely, soiled table-linen, odds and ends that could descend but one step lower into the dust-heap, and all the squalid necessities of a pinched household in Paris? In these days, when the five-franc piece is always lurking in our thoughts and intruding itself into our speech, Dr. Poulain, aged thirty-three, was still a bachelor. Heaven had bestowed on him a mother with no connections. In ten years he had not met with the faintest pretext for a romance in his professional career; his practice lay among clerks and small manufacturers, people in his own sphere of life, with homes very much like his own. His richer patients were butchers, bakers, and the more substantial tradespeople of the neighborhood. These, for the most part, attributed their recovery to Nature, as an excuse for paying for the services of a medical man, who came on foot, at the rate of two francs per visit. In his profession, a carriage is more necessary than medical skill.

A humdrum monotonous life tells in the end upon the most adventurous spirit. A man fashions himself to his lot, he accepts a commonplace existence; and Dr. Poulain, after ten years of his practice, continued his labors of Sisyphus without the despair that made early days so bitter. And yet—like every soul in Paris—he cherished a dream. Remonencq was happy in his dream; La Cibot had a dream of her own; and Dr. Poulain, too, dreamed. Some day he would be called in to attend a rich and influential patient, would effect a positive cure, and the patient would procure a post for him; he would be head surgeon to a hospital, medical officer of a prison or police-court, or doctor to the boulevard theatres.He had come by his present appointment as doctor to the Mairie in this very way. La Cibot had called him in when the landlord of the house in the Rue de Normandie fell ill; he had treated the case with complete success; M. Pillerault, the patient, took an interest in the young doctor, called to thank him, and saw his carefully-hidden poverty. Count Popinot, the cabinet minister, had married M. Pillerault's grand-niece, and greatly respected her uncle; of him, therefore, M. Pillerault had asked for the post, which Poulain had now held for two years. That appointment and its meagre salary came just in time to prevent a desperate step; Poulain was thinking of emigration; and for a Frenchman, it is a kind of death to leave France. Dr. Poulain went, you may be sure, to thank Count Popinot; but as Count Popinot's family physician was the celebrated Horace Bianchon, it was pretty clear that his chances of gaining a footing in that house were something of the slenderest. The poor doctor had fondly hoped for the patronage of a powerful cabinet minister, one of the twelve or fifteen cards which a cunning hand has been shuffling for sixteen years on the green baize of the council table, and now he dropped back again into his Marais, his old groping life among the poor and the small tradespeople, with the privilege of issuing certificates of death for a yearly stipend of twelve hundred francs.

Dr. Poulain had distinguished himself to some extent as a house-student; he was a prudent practitioner, and not without experience. His deaths caused no scandal; he had plenty of opportunities of studying all kinds of complaints in anima vili. Judge, therefore, of the spleen that he nourished! The expression of his countenance, lengthy and not too cheerful to begin with, at times was positively appalling. Set a Tartuffe's all-devouring eyes, and the sour humor of an Alceste in a sallow-parchment visage, and try to imagine for yourself the gait, bearing, and expression of a man who thought himself as good a doctor as the illustrious Bianchon, and felt that he was held down in his narrow lot by an iron hand. He could not help comparing his receipts (ten francs a day if he was fortunate) with Bianchon's five or six hundred. Are the hatreds and jealousies of democracy incomprehensible after this? Ambitious and continually thwarted, he could not reproach himself. He had once already tried his fortune by inventing a purgative pill, something like Morrison's, and intrusted the business operations to an old hospital chum, a house-student who afterwards took a retail drug business; but, unluckily, the druggist, smitten with the charms of a ballet-dancer of the Ambigu-Comique, found himself at length in the bankruptcy court; and as the patent had been taken out in his name, his partner was literally without a remedy, and the important discovery enriched the purchaser of the business. The sometime house-student set sail for Mexico, that land of gold, taking poor Poulain's little savings with him; and, to add insult to injury, the opera-dancer treated him as an extortioner when he applied to her for his money. Not a single rich patient had come to him since he had the luck to cure old M. Pillerault. Poulain made his rounds on foot, scouring the Marais like a lean cat, and obtained from two to forty sous out of a score of visits. The paying patient was a phenomenon about as rare as that anomalous fowl known as a "white blackbird" in all sublunary regions.

The briefless barrister, the doctor without a patient, are pre-eminently the two types of a decorous despair peculiar to this city of Paris; it is mute, dull despair in human form, dressed in a black coat and trousers with shining seams that recall the zinc on an attic roof, a glistening satin waistcoat, a hat preserved like a relic, a pair of old gloves, and a cotton shirt. The man is the incarnation of a melancholy poem, sombre as the secrets of the Conciergerie. Other kinds of poverty, the poverty of the artist—actor, painter, musician, or poet—are relieved and lightened by the artist's joviality, the reckless gaiety of the Bohemian border country—the first stage of the journey to the Thebaid of genius. But these two black-coated professions that go afoot through the street are brought continually in contact with disease and dishonor; they see nothing of human nature but its sores; in the forlorn first stages and beginnings of their career they eye competitors suspiciously and defiantly; concentrated dislike and ambition flashes out in glances like the breaking forth of hidden flames. Let two schoolfellows meet after twenty years, the rich man will avoid the poor; he does not recognize him, he is afraid even to glance into the gulf which Fate has set between him and the friend of other years. The one has been borne through life on the mettlesome steed called Fortune, or wafted on the golden clouds of success; the other has been making his way in underground Paris through the sewers, and bears the marks of his career upon him. How many a chum of old days turned aside at the sight of the doctor's greatcoat and waistcoat!

With this explanation, it should be easy to understand how Dr. Poulain came to lend himself so readily to the farce of La Cibot's illness and recovery. Greed of every kind, ambition of every nature, is not easy to hide. The doctor examined his patient, found that every organ was sound and healthy, admired the regularity of her pulse and the perfect ease of her movements; and as she continued to moan aloud, he saw that for some reason she found it convenient to lie at Death's door. The speedy cure of a serious imaginary disease was sure to cause a sensation in the neighborhood; the doctor would be talked about. He made up his mind at once. He talked of rupture, and of taking it in time, and thought even worse of the case than La Cibot herself. The portress was plied with various remedies, and finally underwent a sham operation, crowned with complete success. Poulain repaired to the Arsenal Library, looked out a grotesque case in some of Desplein's records of extraordinary cures, and fitted the details to Mme. Cibot, modestly attributing the success of the treatment to the great surgeon, in whose steps (he said) he walked. Such is the impudence of beginners in Paris. Everything is made to serve as a ladder by which to climb upon the scene; and as everything, even the rungs of a ladder, will wear out in time, the new members of every profession are at a loss to find the right sort of wood of which to make steps for themselves. There are moments when the Parisian is not propitious. He grows tired of raising pedestals, pouts like a spoiled child, and will have no more idols; or, to state it more accurately, Paris cannot always find a proper object for infatuation. Now and then the vein of genius gives out, and at such times the Parisian may turn supercilious; he is not always willing to bow down and gild mediocrity.





XLIII


Mme. Cibot, entering in her usual unceremonious fashion, found the doctor and his mother at table, before a bowl of lamb's lettuce, the cheapest of all salad-stuffs. The dessert consisted of a thin wedge of Brie cheese flanked by a plate of specked foreign apples and a dish of mixed dry fruits, known as quatre-mendiants, in which the raisin stalks were abundantly conspicuous.

"You can stay, mother," said the doctor, laying a hand on Mme. Poulain's arm; "this is Mme. Cibot, of whom I have told you."

"My respects to you, madame, and my duty to you, sir," said La Cibot, taking the chair which the doctor offered. "Ah! is this your mother, sir? She is very happy to have a son who has such talent; he saved my life, madame, brought me back from the depths."

The widow, hearing Mme. Cibot praise her son in this way, thought her a delightful woman.

"I have just come to tell you, that, between ourselves, poor M. Pons is doing very badly, sir, and I have something to say to you about him—"

"Let us go into the sitting-room," interrupted the doctor, and with a significant gesture he indicated the servant.

In the sitting-room La Cibot explained her position with regard to the pair of nutcrackers at very considerable length. She repeated the history of her loan with added embellishments, and gave a full account of the immense services rendered during the past ten years to MM. Pons and Schmucke. The two old men, to all appearance, could not exist without her motherly care. She posed as an angel; she told so many lies, one after another, watering them with her tears, that old Mme. Poulain was quite touched.

"You understand, my dear sir," she concluded, "that I really ought to know how far I can depend on M. Pons' intentions, supposing that he should not die; not that I want him to die, for looking after those two innocents is my life, madame, you see; still, when one of them is gone I shall look after the other. For my own part, I was built by Nature to rival mothers. Without nobody to care for, nobody to take for a child, I don't know what I should do.... So if M. Poulain only would, he might do me a service for which I should be very grateful; and that is, to say a word to M. Pons for me. Goodness me! an annuity of a thousand francs, is that too much, I ask you?... To M. Schmucke it would be so much gained.—Our dear patient said that he should recommend me to the German, poor man; it is his idea, no doubt, that M. Schmucke should be his heir. But what is a man that cannot put two ideas together in French? And besides, he would be quite capable of going back to Germany, he will be in such despair over his friend's death—"

The doctor grew grave. "My dear Mme. Cibot," he said, "this sort of thing does not in the least concern a doctor. I should not be allowed to exercise my profession if it was known that I interfered in the matter of my patients' testamentary dispositions. The law forbids a doctor to receive a legacy from a patient—"

"A stupid law! What is to hinder me from dividing my legacy with you?" La Cibot said immediately.

"I will go further," said the doctor; "my professional conscience will not permit me to speak to M. Pons of his death. In the first place, he is not so dangerously ill that there is any need to speak of it, and in the second, such talk coming from me might give a shock to the system that would do him real harm, and then his illness might terminate fatally—"

"I don't put on gloves to tell him to get his affairs in order," cried Mme. Cibot, "and he is none the worse for that. He is used to it. There is nothing to fear."

"Not a word more about it, my dear Mme. Cibot! These things are not within a doctor's province; it is a notary's business—"

"But, my dear M. Poulain, suppose that M. Pons of his own accord should ask you how he is, and whether he had better make his arrangements; then, would you refuse to tell him that if you want to get better it is an excellent plan to set everything in order? Then you might just slip in a little word for me—"

"Oh, if he talks of making his will, I certainly shall not dissuade him," said the doctor.

"Very well, that is settled. I came to thank you for your care of me," she added, as she slipped a folded paper containing three gold coins into the doctor's hands. "It is all I can do at the moment. Ah! my dear M. Poulain, if I were rich, you should be rich, you that are the image of Providence on earth.—Madame, you have an angel for a son."

La Cibot rose to her feet, Mme. Poulain bowed amiably, and the doctor went to the door with the visitor. Just then a sudden, lurid gleam of light flashed across the mind of this Lady Macbeth of the streets. She saw clearly that the doctor was her accomplice—he had taken the fee for the sham illness.

"M. Poulain," she began, "how can you refuse to say a word or two to save me from want, when you helped me in the affair of my accident?"

The doctor felt that the devil had him by the hair, as the saying is; he felt, too, that the hair was being twisted round the pitiless red claw. Startled and afraid lest he should sell his honesty for such a trifle, he answered the diabolical suggestion by another no less diabolical.

"Listen, my dear Mme. Cibot," he said, as he drew her into his consulting-room. "I will now pay a debt of gratitude that I owe you for my appointment to the mairie—"

"We go shares?" she asked briskly.

"In what?"

"In the legacy."

"You do not know me," said Dr. Poulain, drawing himself up like Valerius Publicola. "Let us have no more of that. I have a friend, an old schoolfellow of mine, a very intelligent young fellow; and we are so much the more intimate, because, our lives have fallen out very much in the same way. He was studying law while I was a house-student, he was engrossing deeds in Maitre Couture's office. His father was a shoemaker, and mine was a breeches-maker; he has not found anyone to take much interest in his career, nor has he any capital; for, after all, capital is only to be had from sympathizers. He could only afford to buy a provincial connection—at Mantes—and so little do provincials understand the Parisian intellect, that they set all sorts of intrigues on foot against him."

"The wretches!" cried La Cibot.

"Yes," said the doctor. "They combined against him to such purpose, that they forced him to sell his connection by misrepresenting something that he had done; the attorney for the crown interfered, he belonged to the place, and sided with his fellow-townsmen. My friend's name is Fraisier. He is lodged as I am, and he is even leaner and more threadbare. He took refuge in our arrondissement, and is reduced to appear for clients in the police-court or before the magistrate. He lives in the Rue de la Perle close by. Go to No. 9, third floor, and you will see his name on the door on the landing, painted in gilt letters on a small square of red leather. Fraisier makes a special point of disputes among the porters, workmen, and poor folk in the arrondissement, and his charges are low. He is an honest man; for I need not tell you that if he had been a scamp, he would be keeping his carriage by now. I will call and see my friend Fraisier this evening. Go to him early to-morrow; he knows M. Louchard, the bailiff; M. Tabareau, the clerk of the court; and the justice of the peace, M. Vitel; and M. Trognon, the notary. He is even now looked upon as one of the best men of business in the Quarter. If he takes charge of your interests, if you can secure him as M. Pons' adviser, you will have a second self in him, you see. But do not make dishonorable proposals to him, as you did just now to me; he has a head on his shoulders, you will understand each other. And as for acknowledging his services, I will be your intermediary—"

Mme. Cibot looked askance at the doctor. "Is that the lawyer who helped Mme. Florimond the haberdasher in the Rue Vieille-du-Temple out of a fix in that matter of her friend's legacy?"

"The very same."

"Wasn't it a shame that she did not marry him after he had gained two thousand francs a year for her?" exclaimed La Cibot. "And she thought to clear off scores by making him a present of a dozen shirts and a couple of dozen pocket-handkerchiefs; an outfit, in short."

"My dear Mme. Cibot, that outfit cost a thousand francs, and Fraisier was just setting up for himself in the Quarter, and wanted the things very badly. And what was more, she paid the bill without asking any questions. That affair brought him clients, and now he is very busy; but in my line a practice brings—"

"It is only the righteous that suffer here below," said La Cibot. "Well, M. Poulain, good-day and thank you."

And herewith begins the tragedy, or, if you like to have it so, a terrible comedy—the death of an old bachelor delivered over by circumstances too strong for him to the rapacity and greed that gathered about his bed. And other forces came to the support of rapacity and greed; there was the picture collector's mania, that most intense of all passions; there was the cupidity of the Sieur Fraisier, whom you shall presently behold in his den, a sight to make you shudder; and lastly, there was the Auvergnat thirsting for money, ready for anything—even for a crime—that should bring him the capital he wanted. The first part of the story serves in some sort as a prelude to this comedy in which all the actors who have hitherto occupied the stage will reappear.

The degradation of a word is one of those curious freaks of manners upon which whole volumes of explanation might be written. Write to an attorney and address him as "Lawyer So-and-so," and you insult him as surely as you would insult a wholesale colonial produce merchant by addressing your letter to "Mr. So-and-so, Grocer." There are plenty of men of the world who ought to be aware, since the knowledge of such subtle distinctions is their province, that you cannot insult a French writer more cruelly than by calling himun homme de lettres—a literary man. The word monsieur is a capital example of the life and death of words. Abbreviated from monseigneur, once so considerable a title, and even now, in the form of sire, reserved for emperors and kings, it is bestowed indifferently upon all and sundry; while the twin-word messire, which is nothing but its double and equivalent, if by any chance it slips into a certificate of burial, produces an outcry in the Republican papers.

Magistrates, councillors, jurisconsults, judges, barristers, officers for the crown, bailiffs, attorneys, clerks of the court, procurators, solicitors, and agents of various kinds, represent or misrepresent Justice. The "lawyer" and the bailiff's men (commonly called "the brokers") are the two lowest rungs of the ladder. Now, the bailiff's man is an outsider, an adventitious minister of justice, appearing to see that judgment is executed; he is, in fact, a kind of inferior executioner employed by the county court. But the word "lawyer" (homme de loi) is a depreciatory term applied to the legal profession. Consuming professional jealousy finds similar disparaging epithets for fellow-travelers in every walk of life, and every calling has its special insult. The scorn flung into the words homme de loi, homme de lettres, is wanting in the plural form, which may be used without offence; but in Paris every profession, learned or unlearned, has its omega, the individual who brings it down to the level of the lowest class; and the written law has its connecting link with the custom right of the streets. There are districts where the pettifogging man of business, known as Lawyer So-and-So, is still to be found. M. Fraisier was to the member of the Incorporated Law Society as the money-lender of the Halles, offering small loans for a short period at an exorbitant interest, is to the great capitalist. Working people, strange to say are as shy of officials as of fashionable restaurants, they take advice from irregular sources as they turn into a little wineshop to drink. Each rank in life finds its own level, and there abides. None but a chosen few care to climb the heights, few can feel at ease in the presence of their betters, or take their place among them, like a Beaumarchais letting fall the watch of the great lord who tried to humiliate him. And if there are few who can even rise to a higher social level, those among them who can throw off their swaddling-clothes are rare and great exceptions.

At six o'clock the next morning Mme. Cibot stood in the Rue de la Perle; she was making a survey of the abode of her future adviser, Lawyer Fraisier. The house was one of the old-fashioned kind formerly inhabited by small tradespeople and citizens with small means. A cabinetmaker's shop occupied almost the whole of the ground floor, as well as the little yard behind, which was covered with his workshops and warehouses; the small remaining space being taken up by the porter's lodge and the passage entry in the middle. The staircase walls were half rotten with damp and covered with saltpetre to such a degree that the house seemed to be stricken with leprosy.

Mme. Cibot went straight to the porter's lodge, and there encountered one of the fraternity, a shoemaker, his wife, and two small children, all housed in a room ten feet square, lighted from the yard at the back. La Cibot mentioned her profession, named herself, and spoke of her house in the Rue de Normandie, and the two women were on cordial terms at once. After a quarter of an hour spent in gossip while the shoemaker's wife made breakfast ready for her husband and the children, Mme. Cibot turned the conversation to the subject of the lodgers, and spoke of the lawyer.

"I have come to see him on business," she said. "One of his friends,Dr. Poulain, recommended me to him. Do you know Dr. Poulain?"

"I should think I do," said the lady of the Rue de la Perle. "He saved my little girl's life when she had the croup."

"He saved my life, too, madame. What sort of a man is this M. Fraisier?"

"He is the sort of man, my dear lady, out of whom it is very difficult to get the postage-money at the end of the month."

To a person of La Cibot's intelligence this was enough. "One may be poor and honest," observed she.

"I am sure I hope so," returned Fraisier's portress. "We are not rolling in coppers, let alone gold or silver; but we have not a farthing belonging to anybody else."

This sort of talk sounded familiar to La Cibot.

"In short, one can trust him, child, eh?"

"Lord! when M. Fraisier means well by any one, there is not his like, so I have heard Mme. Florimond say."

"And why didn't she marry him when she owed her fortune to him?" La Cibot asked quickly. "It is something for a little haberdasher, kept by an old man, to be a barrister's wife—"

"Why?—" asked the portress, bringing Mme. Cibot out into the passage. "Why?—You are going to see him, are you not, madame?—Very well, when you are in his office you will know why."





XLV


From the state of the staircase, lighted by sash-windows on the side of the yard, it was pretty evident that the inmates of the house, with the exception of the landlord and M. Fraisier himself, were all workmen. There were traces of various crafts in the deposit of mud upon the steps—brass-filings, broken buttons, scraps of gauze, and esparto grass lay scattered about. The walls of the upper stories were covered with apprentices' ribald scrawls and caricatures. The portress' last remark had roused La Cibot's curiosity; she decided, not unnaturally, that she would consult Dr. Poulain's friend; but as for employing him, that must depend upon her impressions.

"I sometimes wonder how Mme. Sauvage can stop in his service," said the portress, by way of comment; she was following in Mme. Cibot's wake. "I will come up with you, madame" she added; "I am taking the milk and the newspaper up to my landlord."

Arrived on the second floor above the entresol, La Cibot beheld a door of the most villainous description. The doubtful red paint was coated for seven or eight inches round the keyhole with a filthy glaze, a grimy deposit from which the modern house-decorator endeavors to protect the doors of more elegant apartments by glass "finger-plates." A grating, almost stopped up with some compound similar to the deposit with which a restaurant-keeper gives an air of cellar-bound antiquity to a merely middle-aged bottle, only served to heighten the general resemblance to a prison door; a resemblance further heightened by the trefoil-shaped iron-work, the formidable hinges, the clumsy nail-heads. A miser, or a pamphleteer at strife with the world at large, must surely have invented these fortifications. A leaden sink, which received the waste water of the household, contributed its quota to the fetid atmosphere of the staircase, and the ceiling was covered with fantastic arabesques traced by candle-smoke—such arabesques! On pulling a greasy acorn tassel attached to the bell-rope, a little bell jangled feebly somewhere within, complaining of the fissure in its metal sides. Every detail was in keeping with the general dismal effect. La Cibot heard a heavy footstep, and the asthmatic wheezing of a virago within, and Mme. Sauvage presently showed herself. Adrien Brauwer might have painted just such a hag for his picture of Witches starting for the Sabbath; a stout, unwholesome slattern, five feet six inches in height, with a grenadier countenance and a beard which far surpassed La Cibot's own; she wore a cheap, hideously ugly cotton gown, a bandana handkerchief knotted over hair which she still continued to put in curl papers (using for that purpose the printed circulars which her master received), and a huge pair of gold earrings like cart-wheels in her ears. This female Cerberus carried a battered skillet in one hand, and opening the door, set free an imprisoned odor of scorched milk—a nauseous and penetrating smell, that lost itself at once, however, among the fumes outside.

"What can I do for you, missus?" demanded Mme. Sauvage, and with a truculent air she looked La Cibot over; evidently she was of the opinion that the visitor was too well dressed, and her eyes looked the more murderous because they were naturally bloodshot.

"I have come to see M. Fraisier; his friend, Dr. Poulain, sent me."

"Oh! come in, missus," said La Sauvage, grown very amiable of a sudden, which proves that she was prepared for this morning visit.

With a sweeping courtesy, the stalwart woman flung open the door of a private office, which looked upon the street, and discovered the ex-attorney of Mantes. The room was a complete picture of a third-rate solicitor's office; with the stained wooden cases, the letter-files so old that they had grown beards (in ecclesiastical language), the red tape dangling limp and dejected, the pasteboard boxes covered with traces of the gambols of mice, the dirty floor, the ceiling tawny with smoke. A frugal allowance of wood was smouldering on a couple of fire-dogs on the hearth. And on the chimney-piece above stood a foggy mirror and a modern clock with an inlaid wooden case; Fraisier had picked it up at an execution sale, together with the tawdry imitation rococo candlesticks,with the zinc beneath showing through the lacquer in several places. M. Fraisier was small, thin, and unwholesome looking; his red face, covered with an eruption, told of tainted blood; and he had, moreover, a trick of continually scratching his right arm. A wig pushed to the back of his head displayed a brick-colored cranium of ominous conformation. This person rose from a cane-seated armchair, in which he sat on a green leather cushion, assumed an agreeable expression, and brought forward a chair.

"Mme. Cibot, I believe?" queried he, in dulcet tones.

"Yes, sir," answered the portress. She had lost her habitual assurance.

Something in the tones of a voice which strongly resembled the sounds of the little door-bell, something in a glance even sharper than the sharp green eyes of her future legal adviser, scared Mme. Cibot. Fraisier's presence so pervaded the room, that any one might have thought there was pestilence in the air; and in a flash Mme. Cibot understood why Mme. Florimond had not become Mme. Fraisier.

"Poulain told me about you, my dear madame," said the lawyer, in the unnatural fashion commonly described by the words "mincing tones"; tones sharp, thin, and grating as verjuice, in spite of all his efforts.

Arrived at this point, he tried to draw the skirts of his dressing-gown over a pair of angular knees encased in threadbare felt. The robe was an ancient printed cotton garment, lined with wadding which took the liberty of protruding itself through various slits in it here and there; the weight of this lining had pulled the skirts aside, disclosing a dingy-hued flannel waistcoat beneath. With something of a coxcomb's manner, Fraisier fastened this refractory article of dress, tightening the girdle to define his reedy figure; then with a blow of the tongs, he effected a reconciliation between two burning brands that had long avoided one another, like brothers after a family quarrel. A sudden bright idea struck him, and he rose from his chair. "Mme. Sauvage!" called he.

"Well?"

"I am not at home to anybody!"

"Eh! bless your life, there's no need to say that!"

"She is my old nurse," the lawyer said in some confusion.

"And she has not recovered her figure yet," remarked the heroine of the Halles.

Fraisier laughed, and drew the bolt lest his housekeeper should interrupt Mme. Cibot's confidences. "Well, madame, explain your business," said he, making another effort to drape himself in the dressing-gown. "Any one recommended to me by the only friend I have in the world may count upon me—I may say—absolutely."

For half an hour Mme. Cibot talked, and the man of law made no interruption of any sort; his face wore the expression of curious interest with which a young soldier listens to a pensioner of "The Old Guard." Fraisier's silence and acquiescence, the rapt attention with which he appeared to listen to a torrent of gossip similar to the samples previously given, dispelled some of the prejudices inspired in La Cibot's mind by his squalid surroundings.





XLVI


The little lawyer with the black-speckled green eyes was in reality making a study of his client. When at length she came to a stand and looked to him to speak, he was seized with a fit of the complaint known as a "churchyard cough," and had recourse to an earthenware basin half full of herb tea, which he drained.

"But for Poulain, my dear madame, I should have been dead before this," said Fraisier, by way of answer to the portress' look of motherly compassion;"but he will bring me round, he says—"

As all the client's confidences appeared to have slipped from the memory of her legal adviser, she began to cast about for a way of taking leave of a man so apparently near death.

"In an affair of this kind, madame," continued the attorney from Mantes, suddenly returning to business, "there are two things which it is most important to know. In the first place, whether the property is sufficient to be worth troubling about; and in the second, who the next-of-kin may be; for if the property is the booty, the next-of-kin is the enemy."

La Cibot immediately began to talk of Remonencq and Elie Magus, and said that the shrewd couple valued the pictures at six hundred thousand francs.

"Would they take them themselves at that price?" inquired the lawyer. "You see, madame, that men of business are shy of pictures. A picture may mean a piece of canvas worth a couple of francs or a painting worth two hundred thousand. Now, paintings worth two hundred thousand francs are usually well known; and what errors in judgment people make in estimating even the most famous pictures of all! There was once a great capitalist whose collection was admired, visited, and engraved—actually engraved! He was supposed to have spent millions of francs on it. He died, as men must, and—well, his genuine pictures did not fetch more than two hundred thousand francs! You must let me see these gentlemen.—Now for the next-of-kin," and Fraisier again relapsed into his attitude of listener.

When President Camusot's name came up, he nodded with a grimace which riveted Mme. Cibot's attention. She tried to read the forehead and the villainous face, and found what is called in business a "wooden head."

"Yes, my dear sir," repeated La Cibot. "Yes, my M. Pons is own cousin to President Camusot de Marville; he tells me that ten times a day. M. Camusot the silk mercer was married twice—"

"He that has just been nominated for a peer of France?—"

"And his first wife was a Mlle. Pons, M. Pons' first cousin."

"Then they are first cousins once removed—"

"They are 'not cousins.' They have quarreled."

It may be remembered that before M. Camusot de Marville came to Paris, he was President of the Tribunal of Mantes for five years; and not only was his name still remembered there, but he had kept up a correspondence with Mantes. Camusot's immediate successor, the judge with whom he had been most intimate during his term of office, was still President of the Tribunal, and consequently knew all about Fraisier.

"Do you know, madame," Fraisier said, when at last the red sluices of La Cibot's torrent tongue were closed, "do you know that your principal enemy will be a man who can send you to the scaffold?"

The portress started on her chair, making a sudden spring like a jack-in-the-box.

"Calm yourself, dear madame," continued Fraisier. "You may not have known the name of the President of the Chamber of Indictments at the Court of Appeal in Paris; but you ought to have known that M. Pons must have an heir-at-law. M. le President de Marville is your invalid's sole heir; but as he is a collateral in the third degree, M. Pons is entitled by law to leave his fortune as he pleases. You are not aware either that, six weeks ago at least, M. le President's daughter married the eldest son of M. le Comte Popinot, peer of France, once Minister of Agriculture, and President of the Board of Trade, one of the most influential politicians of the day. President de Marville is even more formidable through this marriage than in his own quality of head of the Court of Assize."

At that word La Cibot shuddered.

"Yes, and it is he who sends you there," continued Fraisier. "Ah! my dear madame, you little know what a red robe means! It is bad enough to have a plain black gown against you! You see me here, ruined, bald, broken in health—all because, unwittingly, I crossed a mere attorney for the crown in the provinces. I was forced to sell my connection at a loss, and very lucky I was to come off with the loss of my money. If I had tried to stand out, my professional position would have gone as well. One thing more you do not know," he continued, "and this it is. If you had only to do with President Camusot himself, it would be nothing; but he has a wife, mind you!—and if you ever find yourself face to face with that wife, you will shake in your shoes as if you were on the first step of the scaffold, your hair will stand on end. The Presidente is so vindictive that she would spend ten years over setting a trap to kill you. She sets that husband of hers spinning like a top. Through her a charming young fellow committed suicide at the Conciergerie. A count was accused of forgery—she made his character as white as snow. She all but drove a person of the highest quality from the Court of Charles X. Finally, she displaced the Attorney-General, M. de Granville—"

"That lived in the Rue Vieille-du-Temple, at the corner of the Rue Saint-Francois?"

"The very same. They say that she means to make her husband Home Secretary, and I do not know that she will not gain her end.—If she were to take it into her head to send us both to the Criminal Court first and the hulks afterwards—I should apply for a passport and set sail for America, though I am as innocent as a new-born babe. So well I know what justice means. Now, see here, my dear Mme. Cibot; to marry her only daughter to young Vicomte Popinot (heir to M. Pillerault, your landlord, it is said)—to make that match, she stripped herself of her whole fortune, so much so that the President and his wife have nothing at this moment except his official salary. Can you suppose, my dear madame, that under the circumstances Mme. la Presidente will let M. Pons' property go out of the family without a word?—Why, I would sooner face guns loaded with grape-shot than have such a woman for my enemy—"

"But they have quarreled," put in La Cibot.

"What has that got to do with it?" asked Fraisier. "It is one reason the more for fearing her. To kill a relative of whom you are tired, is something; but to inherit his property afterwards—that is a real pleasure!"

"But the old gentleman has a horror of his relatives. He says over and over again that these people—M. Cardot, M. Berthier, and the rest of them (I can't remember their names)—have crushed him as a tumbril cart crushes an egg—"

"Have you a mind to be crushed too?"

"Oh dear! oh dear!" cried La Cibot. "Ah! Ma'am Fontaine was right when she said that I should meet with difficulties: still, she said that I should succeed—"

"Listen, my dear Mme. Cibot.—As for making some thirty thousand francs out of this business—that is possible; but for the whole of the property, it is useless to think of it. We talked over your case yesterday evening, Dr. Poulain and I—"

La Cibot started again.

"Well, what is the matter?"

"But if you knew about the affair, why did you let me chatter away like a magpie?"

"Mme. Cibot, I knew all about your business, but I knew nothing of Mme. Cibot. So many clients, so many characters—"

Mme. Cibot gave her legal adviser a queer look at this; all her suspicions gleamed in her eyes. Fraisier saw this.





XLVII


"I resume," he continued. "So, our friend Poulain was once called in by you to attend old M. Pillerault, the Countess Popinot's great-uncle; that is one of your claims to my devotion. Poulain goes to see your landlord (mark this!) once a fortnight; he learned all these particulars from him. M. Pillerault was present at his grand-nephew's wedding—for he is an uncle with money to leave; he has an income of fifteen thousand francs, though he has lived like a hermit for the last five-and-twenty years, and scarcely spends a thousand crowns—well, he told Poulain all about this marriage. It seems that your old musician was precisely the cause of the row; he tried to disgrace his own family by way of revenge.—If you only hear one bell, you only hear one sound.—Your invalid says that he meant no harm, but everybody thinks him a monster of—"

"And it would not astonish me if he was!" cried La Cibot. "Just imagine it!—For these ten years past I have been money out of pocket for him, spending my savings on him, and he knows it, and yet he will not let me lie down to sleep on a legacy!—No, sir! he will not. He is obstinate, a regular mule he is.—I have talked to him these ten days, and the cross-grained cur won't stir no more than a sign-post. He shuts his teeth and looks at me like—The most that he would say was that he would recommend me to M. Schmucke."

"Then he means to make his will in favor of this Schmucke?"

"Everything will go to him—"

"Listen, my dear Mme. Cibot, if I am to arrive at any definite conclusions and think of a plan, I must know M. Schmucke. I must see the property and have some talk with this Jew of whom you speak; and then, let me direct you—"

"We shall see, M. Fraisier."

"What is this? 'We shall see?'" repeated Fraisier, speaking in the voice natural to him, as he gave La Cibot a viperous glance. "Am I your legal adviser or am I not, I say? Let us know exactly where we stand."

La Cibot felt that he read her thoughts. A cold chill ran down her back. "I have told you all I know," she said. She saw that she was at the tiger's mercy.

"We attorneys are accustomed to treachery. Just think carefully over your position; it is superb.—If you follow my advice point by point, you will have thirty or forty thousand francs. But there is a reverse side to this beautiful medal. How if the Presidente comes to hear that M. Pons' property is worth a million of francs, and that you mean to have a bit out of it?—for there is always somebody ready to take that kind of errand—" he added parenthetically.

This remark, and the little pause that came before and after it, sent another shudder through La Cibot. She thought at once that Fraisier himself would probably undertake that office.

"And then, my dear client, in ten minutes old Pillerault is asked to dismiss you, and then on a couple of hours' notice—"

"What does that matter to me?" said La Cibot, rising to her feet like a Bellona; "I shall stay with the gentlemen as their housekeeper."

"And then, a trap will be set for you, and some fine morning you and your husband will wake up in a prison cell, to be tried for your lives—"

"I?" cried La Cibot, "I that have not a farthing that doesn't belong to me?... I!... I!"

For five minutes she held forth, and Fraisier watched the great artist before him as she executed a concerto of self-praise. He was quite untouched, and even amused by the performance. His keen glances pricked La Cibot like stilettos; he chuckled inwardly, till his shrunken wig was shaking with laughter. He was a Robespierre at an age when the Sylla of France was make couplets.

"And how? and why? And on what pretext?" demanded she, when she had come to an end.

"You wish to know how you may come to the guillotine?"

La Cibot turned pale as death at the words; the words fell like a knife upon her neck. She stared wildly at Fraisier.

"Listen to me, my dear child," began Fraisier, suppressing his inward satisfaction at his client's discomfiture.

"I would sooner leave things as they are—" murmured La Cibot, and she rose to go.

"Stay," Fraisier said imperiously. "You ought to know the risks that you are running; I am bound to give you the benefit of my lights.—You are dismissed by M. Pillerault, we will say; there is no doubt about that, is there? You enter the service of these two gentlemen. Very good! That is a declaration of war against the Presidente. You mean to do everything you can to gain possession of the property, and to get a slice of it at any rate—"

"Oh, I am not blaming you," Fraisier continued, in answer to a gesture from his client. "It is not my place to do so. This is a battle, and you will be led on further than you think for. One grows full of one's ideas, one hits hard—"

Another gesture of denial. This time La Cibot tossed her head.

"There, there, old lady," said Fraisier, with odious familiarity, "you will go a very long way!—"

"You take me for a thief, I suppose?"

"Come, now, mamma, you hold a receipt in M. Schmucke's hand which did not cost you much.—Ah! you are in the confessional, my lady! Don't deceive your confessor, especially when the confessor has the power of reading your thoughts."

La Cibot was dismayed by the man's perspicacity; now she knew why he had listened to her so intently.

"Very good," continued he, "you can admit at once that the Presidente will not allow you to pass her in the race for the property.—You will be watched and spied upon.—You get your name into M. Pons' will; nothing could be better. But some fine day the law steps in, arsenic is found in a glass, and you and your husband are arrested, tried, and condemned for attempting the life of the Sieur Pons, so as to come by your legacy. I once defended a poor woman at Versailles; she was in reality as innocent as you would be in such a case. Things were as I have told you, and all that I could do was to save her life. The unhappy creature was sentenced to twenty years' penal servitude. She is working out her time now at St.Lazare."

Mme. Cibot's terror grew to the highest pitch. She grew paler and paler, staring at the little, thin man with the green eyes, as some wretched Moor, accused of adhering to her own religion, might gaze at the inquisitor who doomed her to the stake.

"Then, do you tell me, that if I leave you to act, and put my interests in your hands, I shall get something without fear?"

"I guarantee you thirty thousand francs," said Fraisier, speaking like a man sure of the fact.

"After all, you know how fond I am of dear Dr. Poulain," she began again in her most coaxing tones; "he told me to come to you, worthy man, and he did not send me here to be told that I shall be guillotined for poisoning some one."

The thought of the guillotine so moved her that she burst into tears, her nerves were shaken, terror clutched at her heart, she lost her head. Fraisier gloated over his triumph. When he saw his client hesitate, he thought that he had lost his chance; he had set himself to frighten and quell La Cibot till she was completely in his power, bound hand and foot. She had walked into his study as a fly walks into a spider's web; there she was doomed to remain, entangled in the toils of the little lawyer who meant to feed upon her. Out of this bit of business, indeed, Fraisier meant to gain the living of old days; comfort, competence, and consideration. He and his friend Dr. Poulain had spent the whole previous evening in a microscopic examination of the case; they had made mature deliberations. The doctor described Schmucke for his friend's benefit, and the alert pair had plumbed all hypotheses and scrutinized all risks and resources, till Fraisier, exultant, cried aloud, "Both our fortunes lie in this!" He had gone so far as to promise Poulain a hospital, and as for himself, he meant to be justice of the peace of an arrondissement.

To be a justice of the peace! For this man with his abundant capacity, for this doctor of law without a pair of socks to his name, the dream was a hippogriff so restive, that he thought of it as a deputy-advocate thinks of the silk gown, as an Italian priest thinks of the tiara. It was indeed a wild dream! M. Vitel, the justice of the peace before whom Fraisier pleaded, was a man of sixty-nine, in failing health; he talked of retiring on a pension; and Fraisier used to talk with Poulain of succeeding him, much as Poulain talked of saving the life of some rich heiress and marrying her afterwards. No one knows how greedily every post in the gift of authority is sought after in Paris. Every one wants to live in Paris. If a stamp or tobacco license falls in, a hundred women rise up as one and stir all their friends to obtain it. Any vacancy in the ranks of the twenty-four collectors of taxes sends a flood of ambitious folk surging in upon the Chamber of Deputies. Decisions are made in committee, all appointments are made by the Government. Now the salary of a justice of the peace, the lowest stipendiary magistrate in Paris, is about six thousand francs. The post of registrar to the court is worth a hundred thousand francs. Few places are more coveted in the administration. Fraisier, as a justice of the peace, with the head physician of a hospital for his friend, would make a rich marriage himself and a good match for Dr. Poulain. Each would lend a hand to each.





XLVIII


Night set its leaden seal upon the plans made by the sometime attorney of Mantes, and a formidable scheme sprouted up, a flourishing scheme, fertile in harvests of gain and intrigue. La Cibot was the hinge upon which the whole matter turned; and for this reason, any rebellion on the part of the instrument must be at once put down; such action on her part was quite unexpected; but Fraisier had put forth all the strength of his rancorous nature, and the audacious portress lay trampled under his feet.

"Come, reassure yourself, my dear madame," he remarked, holding out his hand.

The touch of the cold, serpent-like skin made a terrible impression upon the portress. It brought about something like a physical reaction, which checked her emotion; Mme. Fontaine's toad, Astaroth, seemed to her to be less deadly than this poison-sac that wore a sandy wig and spoke in tones like the creaking of a hinge.

"Do not imagine that I am frightening you to no purpose," Fraisier continued. (La Cibot's feeling of repulsion had not escaped him.) "The affairs which made Mme. la Presidente's dreadful reputation are so well known at the law-courts, that you can make inquiries there if you like. The great person who was all but sent into a lunatic asylum was the Marquis d'Espard. The Marquis d'Esgrignon was saved from the hulks. The handsome young man with wealth and a great future before him, who was to have married a daughter of one of the first families of France, and hanged himself in a cell of the Conciergerie, was the celebrated Lucien de Rubempre; the affair made a great deal of noise in Paris at the time. That was a question of a will. His mistress, the notorious Esther, died and left him several millions, and they accused the young fellow of poisoning her. He was not even in Paris at the time of her death, nor did he so much as know the woman had left the money to him!—One cannot well be more innocent than that! Well, after M. Camusot examined him, he hanged himself in his cell. Law, like medicine, has its victims. In the first case, one man suffers for the many, and in the second, he dies for science," he added, and an ugly smile stole over his lips. "Well, I know the risks myself, you see; poor and obscure little attorney as I am, the law has been the ruin of me. My experience was dearly bought—it is all at your service."

"Thank you, no," said La Cibot; "I will have nothing to do with it, upon my word!... I shall have nourished ingratitude, that is all! I want nothing but my due; I have thirty years of honesty behind me, sir. M. Pons says that he will recommend me to his friend Schmucke; well and good, I shall end my days in peace with the German, good man."

Fraisier had overshot his mark. He had discouraged La Cibot. Now he was obliged to remove these unpleasant impressions.

"Do not let us give up," he said; "just go away quietly home. Come, now, we will steer the affair to a good end."

"But what about my rentes, what am I to do to get them, and—"

"And feel no remorse?" he interrupted quickly. "Eh! it is precisely for that that men of business were invented; unless you keep within the law, you get nothing. You know nothing of law; I know a good deal. I will see that you keep on the right side of it, and you can hold your own in all men's sight. As for your conscience, that is your own affair."

"Very well, tell me how to do it," returned La Cibot, curious and delighted.

"I do not know how yet. I have not looked at the strong points of the case yet; I have been busy with the obstacles. But the first thing to be done is to urge him to make a will; you cannot go wrong over that; and find out, first of all, how Pons means to leave his fortune; for if you were his heir—"

"No, no; he does not like me. Ah! if I had but known the value of his gimcracks, and if I had known what I know now about his amours, I should be easy in my mind this day—"

"Keep on, in fact," broke in Fraisier. "Dying folk have queer fancies, my dear madame; they disappoint hopes many a time. Let him make his will, and then we shall see. And of all things, the property must be valued. So I must see this Remonencq and the Jew; they will be very useful to us. Put entire confidence in me, I am at your disposal. When a client is a friend to me, I am his friend through thick and thin. Friend or enemy, that is my character."

"Very well," said La Cibot, "I am yours entirely; and as for fees, M. Poulain—"

"Let us say nothing about that," said Fraisier. "Think how you can keep Poulain at the bedside; he is one of the most upright and conscientious men I know; and, you see, we want some one there whom we can trust. Poulain would do better than I; I have lost my character."

"You look as if you had," said La Cibot; "but, for my own part, I should trust you."

"And you would do well. Come to see me whenever anything happens, and—there!—you are an intelligent woman; all will go well."

"Good-day, M. Fraisier. I hope you will recover your health. Your servant, sir."

Fraisier went to the door with his client. But this time it was he, and not La Cibot, who was struck with an idea on the threshold. "If you could persuade M. Pons to call me in, it would be a great step."

"I will try," said La Cibot.

Fraisier drew her back into his sanctum. "Look here, old lady, I know M. Trognon, the notary of the quarter, very well. If M. Pons has not a notary, mention M. Trognon to him. Make him take M. Trognon—"

"Right," returned La Cibot.

And as she came out again she heard the rustle of a dress and the sound of a stealthy, heavy footstep. Out in the street and by herself, Mme. Cibot to some extent recovered her liberty of mind as she walked. Though the influence of the conversation was still upon her, and she had always stood in dread of scaffolds, justice, and judges, she took a very natural resolution which was to bring about a conflict of strategy between her and her formidable legal adviser.

"What do I want with other folk?" said she to herself. "Let us make a round sum, and afterwards I will take all that they offer me to push their interests;" and this thought, as will shortly be seen, hastened the poor old musician's end.





LIX


"Well, dear M. Schmucke, and how is our dear, adored patient?" asked La Cibot, as she came into the room.

"Fery pad; Bons haf peen vandering all der night."

"Then, what did he say?"

"Chust nonsense. He vould dot I haf all his fortune, on kondition dot I sell nodings.—Den he cried! Boor mann! It made me ver' sad."

"Never mind, honey," returned the portress. "I have kept you waiting for your breakfast; it is nine o'clock and past; but don't scold me. I have business on hand, you see, business of yours. Here are we without any money, and I have been out to get some."

"Vere?" asked Schmucke.

"Of my uncle."

"Onkel?"

"Up the spout."

"Shpout?"

"Oh! the dear man! how simple he is? No, you are a saint, a love, an archbishop of innocence, a man that ought to be stuffed, as the old actor said. What! you have lived in Paris for twenty-nine years; you saw the Revolution of July, you did, and you have never so much as heard tell of a pawnbroker—a man that lends you money on your things?—I have been pawning our silver spoons and forks, eight of them, thread pattern. Pooh, Cibot can eat his victuals with German silver; it is quite the fashion now, they say. It is not worth while to say anything to our angel there; it would upset him and make him yellower than before, and he is quite cross enough as it is. Let us get him round again first, and afterwards we shall see. What must be must; and we must take things as we find them, eh?"

"Goot voman! nople heart!" cried poor Schmucke, with a great tenderness in his face. He took La Cibot's hand and clasped it to his breast. When he looked up, there were tears in his eyes.

"There, that will do, Papa Schmucke; how funny you are! This is too bad. I am an old daughter of the people—my heart is in my hand. I have something here, you see, like you have, hearts of gold that you are," she added, slapping her chest.

"Baba Schmucke!" continued the musician. "No. To know de tepths of sorrow, to cry mit tears of blood, to mount up in der hefn—dat is mein lot! I shall not lif after Bons—"

"Gracious! I am sure you won't, you are killing yourself.—Listen, pet!"

"Bet?"

"Very well, my sonny—"

"Zonny?"

"My lamb, then, if you like it better."

"It is not more clear."

"Oh, well, let me take care of you and tell you what to do; for if you go on like this, I shall have both of you laid up on my hands, you see. To my little way of thinking, we must do the work between us. You cannot go about Paris to give lessons for it tires you, and then you are not fit to do anything afterwards, and somebody must sit up of a night with M. Pons, now that he is getting worse and worse. I will run round to-day to all your pupils and tell them that you are ill; is it not so? And then you can spend the nights with our lamb, and sleep of a morning from five o'clock till, let us say, two in the afternoon. I myself will take the day, the most tiring part, for there is your breakfast and dinner to get ready, and the bed to make, and the things to change, and the doses of medicine to give. I could not hold out for another ten days at this rate. What would become of you if I were to fall ill? And you yourself, it makes one shudder to see you; just look at yourself, after sitting up with him last night!"

She drew Schmucke to the glass, and Schmucke thought that there was a great change.

"So, if you are of my mind, I'll have your breakfast ready in a jiffy. Then you will look after our poor dear again till two o'clock. Let me have a list of your people, and I will soon arrange it. You will be free for a fortnight. You can go to bed when I come in, and sleep till night."

So prudent did the proposition seem, that Schmucke then and there agreed to it.

"Not a word to M. Pons; he would think it was all over with him, you know, if we were to tell him in this way that his engagement at the theatre and his lessons are put off. He would be thinking that he should not find his pupils again, poor gentleman—stuff and nonsense! M. Poulain says that we shall save our Benjamin if we keep him as quiet as possible."

"Ach! fery goot! Pring up der preakfast; I shall make der bett, and gif you die attresses!—You are right; it vould pe too much for me."

An hour later La Cibot, in her Sunday clothes, departed in great state, to the no small astonishment of the Remonencqs; she promised herself that she would support the character of confidential servant of the pair of nutcrackers, in the boarding-schools and private families in which they gave music-lessons.

It is needless to repeat all the gossip in which La Cibot indulged on her round. The members of every family, the head-mistress of every boarding-school, were treated to a variation upon the theme of Pons' illness. A single scene, which took place in the Illustrious Gaudissart's private room, will give a sufficient idea of the rest. La Cibot met with unheard-of difficulties, but she succeeded in penetrating at last to the presence. Kings and cabinet ministers are less difficult of access than the manager of a theatre in Paris; nor is it hard to understand why such prodigious barriers are raised between them and ordinary mortals: a king has only to defend himself from ambition; the manager of a theatre has reason to dread the wounded vanity of actors and authors.

La Cibot, however, struck up an acquaintance with the portress, and traversed all distances in a brief space. There is a sort of freemasonry among the porter tribe, and, indeed, among the members of every profession; for each calling has its shibboleth, as well as its insulting epithet and the mark with which it brands its followers.

"Ah! madame, you are the portress here," began La Cibot. "I myself am a portress, in a small way, in a house in the Rue de Normandie. M. Pons, your conductor, lodges with us. Oh, how glad I should be to have your place, and see the actors and dancers and authors go past. It is the marshal's baton in our profession, as the old actor said."

"And how is M. Pons going on, good man?" inquired the portress.

"He is not going on at all; he has not left his bed these two months. He will only leave the house feet foremost, that is certain."

"He will be missed."

"Yes. I have come with a message to the manager from him. Just try to get me a word with him, dear."

"A lady from M. Pons to see you, sir!" After this fashion did the youth attached to the service of the manager's office announce La Cibot, whom the portress below had particularly recommended to his care.

Gaudissart had just come in for a rehearsal. Chance so ordered it that no one wished to speak with him; actors and authors were alike late. Delighted to have news of his conductor, he made a Napoleonic gesture, and La Cibot was admitted.





L


The sometime commercial traveler, now the head of a popular theatre, regarded his sleeping partners in the light of a legitimate wife; they were not informed of all his doings. The flourishing state of his finances had reacted upon his person. Grown big and stout and high-colored with good cheer and prosperity, Gaudissart made no disguise of his transformation into a Mondor.

"We are turning into a city-father," he once said, trying to be the first to laugh.

"You are only in the Turcaret stage yet, though," retorted Bixiou, who often replaced Gaudissart in the company of the leading lady of the ballet, the celebrated Heloise Brisetout.

The former Illustrious Gaudissart, in fact, was exploiting the theatre simply and solely for his own particular benefit, and with brutal disregard of other interests. He first insinuated himself as a collaborator in various ballets, plays, and vaudevilles; then he waited till the author wanted money and bought up the other half of the copyright. These after-pieces and vaudevilles, always added to successful plays, brought him in a daily harvest of gold coins. He trafficked by proxy in tickets, allotting a certain number to himself, as the manager's share, till he took in this way a tithe of the receipts. And Gaudissart had other methods of making money besides these official contributions. He sold boxes, he took presents from indifferent actresses burning to go upon the stage to fill small speaking parts, or simply to appear as queens, or pages, and the like; he swelled his nominal third share of the profits to such purpose that the sleeping partners scarcely received one-tenth instead of the remaining two-thirds of the net receipts. Even so, however, the tenth paid them a dividend of fifteen per cent on their capital. On the strength of that fifteen per cent Gaudissart talked of his intelligence, honesty, and zeal, and the good fortune of his partners.

When Count Popinot, showing an interest in the concern, asked Matifat, or General Gouraud (Matifat's son-in-law), or Crevel, whether they were satisfied with Gaudissart, Gouraud, now a peer of France, answered, "They say he robs us; but he is such a clever, good-natured fellow, that we are quite satisfied."

"This is like La Fontaine's fable," smiled the ex-cabinet minister.

Gaudissart found investments for his capital in other ventures. He thought well of Schwab, Brunner, and the Graffs; that firm was promoting railways, he became a shareholder in the lines. His shrewdness was carefully hidden beneath the frank carelessness of a man of pleasure; he seemed to be interested in nothing but amusements and dress, yet he thought everything over, and his wide experience of business gained as a commercial traveler stood him in good stead. A self-made man, he did not take himself seriously. He gave suppers and banquets to celebrities in rooms sumptuously furnished by the house decorator. Showy by nature, with a taste for doing things handsomely, he affected an easy-going air, and seemed so much the less formidable because he had kept the slang of "the road" (to use his own expression), with a few green-room phrases superadded. Now, artists in the theatrical profession are wont to express themselves with some vigor; Gaudissart borrowed sufficient racy green-room talk to blend with his commercial traveler's lively jocularity, and passed for a wit. He was thinking at that moment of selling his license and "going into another line," as he said. He thought of being chairman of a railway company, of becoming a responsible person and an administrator, and finally of marrying Mlle. Minard, daughter of the richest mayor in Paris. He might hope to get into the Chamber through "his line," and, with Popinot's influence, to take office under the Government.

"Whom have I the honor of addressing?" inquired Gaudissart, looking magisterially at La Cibot.

"I am M. Pons' confidential servant, sir."

"Well, and how is the dear fellow?"

"Ill, sir—very ill."

"The devil he is! I am sorry to hear it—I must come and see him; he is such a man as you don't often find."

"Ah yes! sir, he is a cherub, he is. I have always wondered how he came to be in a theatre."

"Why, madame, the theatre is a house of correction for morals," said Gaudissart. "Poor Pons!—Upon my word, one ought to cultivate the species to keep up the stock. 'Tis a pattern man, and has talent too. When will he be able to take his orchestra again, do you think? A theatre, unfortunately, is like a stage coach: empty or full, it starts at the same time. Here at six o'clock every evening, up goes the curtain; and if we are never sorry for ourselves, it won't make good music. Let us see now—how is he?"

La Cibot pulled out her pocket-handkerchief and held it to her eyes. "It is a terrible thing to say, my dear sir," said she; "but I am afraid we shall lose him, though we are as careful of him as of the apple of our eyes. And, at the same time, I came to say that you must not count on M. Schmucke, worthy man, for he is going to sit up with him at night. One cannot help doing as if there was hope still left, and trying one's best to snatch the dear, good soul from death. But the doctor has given him up——"

"What is the matter with him?"

"He is dying of grief, jaundice, and liver complaint, with a lot of family affairs to complicate matters."

"And a doctor as well," said Gaudissart. "He ought to have had Lebrun, our doctor; it would have cost him nothing."

"M. Pons' doctor is a Providence on earth. But what can a doctor do, no matter how clever he is, with such complications?"

"I wanted the good pair of nutcrackers badly for the accompaniment of my new fairy piece."

"Is there anything that I can do for them?" asked La Cibot, and her expression would have done credit to a Jocrisse.

Gaudissart burst out laughing.

"I am their housekeeper, sir, and do many things for my gentle-men—"

She did not finish her speech, for in the middle of Gaudissart's roar of laughter a woman's voice exclaimed, "If you are laughing, old man,one may come in," and the leading lady of the ballet rushed into the room and flung herself upon the only sofa. The newcomer was Heloise Brisetout, with a splendid algerienne, such as scarves used to be called, about her shoulders.

"Who is amusing you? Is it this lady? What post does she want?" asked this nymph, giving the manager such a glance as artist gives artist, a glance that would make a subject for a picture.

Heloise, a young woman of exceedingly literary tastes, was on intimate terms with great and famous artists in Bohemia. Elegant, accomplished, and graceful, she was more intelligent than dancers usually are. As she put her question, she sniffed at a scent-bottle full of some aromatic perfume.

"One fine woman is as good as another, madame; and if I don't sniff the pestilence out of a scent-bottle, nor daub brickdust on my cheeks—"

"That would be a sinful waste, child, when Nature put it on for you to begin with," said Heloise, with a side glance at her manager.

"I am an honest woman—"

"So much the worse for you. It is not every one by a long chalk that can find some one to keep them, and kept I am, and in slap-up style, madame."

"So much the worse! What do you mean? Oh, you may toss your head and go about in scarves, you will never have as many declarations as I have had, missus. You will never match the Belle Ecaillere of the Cadran Bleu."

Heloise Brisetout rose at once to her feet, stood at attention, and made a military salute, like a soldier who meets his general.

"What?" asked Gaudissart, "are you really La Belle Ecaillere of whom my father used to talk?"

"In that case the cachucha and the polka were after your time; and madame has passed her fiftieth year," remarked Heloise, and striking an attitude, she declaimed, "'Cinna, let us be friends.'"

"Come, Heloise, the lady is not up to this; let her alone."

"Madame is perhaps the New Heloise," suggested La Cibot, with sly innocence.

"Not bad, old lady!" cried Gaudissart.

"It is a venerable joke," said the dancer, "a grizzled pun; find us another old lady—or take a cigarette."

"I beg your pardon, madame, I feel too unhappy to answer you; my two gentlemen are very ill; and to buy nourishment for them and to spare them trouble, I have pawned everything down to my husband's clothes that I pledged this morning. Here is the ticket!"

"Oh! here, the affair is becoming tragic," cried the fair Heloise. "What is it all about?"

"Madame drops down upon us like—"

"Like a dancer," said Heloise; "let me prompt you,—missus!"

"Come, I am busy," said Gaudissart. "The joke has gone far enough. Heloise, this is M. Pons' confidential servant; she had come to tell me that I must not count upon him; our poor conductor is not expected to live. I don't know what to do."

"Oh! poor man; why, he must have a benefit."

"It would ruin him," said Gaudissart. "He might find next day that he owed five hundred francs to charitable institutions, and they refuse to admit that there are any sufferers in Paris except their own. No, look here, my good woman, since you are going in for the Montyon prize——"

He broke off, rang the bell, and the youth before mentioned suddenly appeared.

"Tell the cashier to send me up a thousand-franc note.—Sit down, madame."

"Ah! poor woman, look, she is crying!" exclaimed Heloise. "How stupid! There, there, mother, we will go to see him; don't cry.—I say, now," she continued, taking the manager into a corner, "you want to make me take the leading part in the ballet in Ariane, you Turk. You are going to be married, and you know how I can make you miserable—"

"Heloise, my heart is copper-bottomed like a man-of-war."

"I shall bring your children on the scene! I will borrow some some-where."

"I have owned up about the attachment."

"Do be nice, and give Pons' post to Garangeot; he has talent, poor fellow, and he has not a penny; and I promise peace."

"But wait till Pons is dead, in case the good man may come back again."

"Oh, as to that, no, sir," said La Cibot. "He began to wander in his mind last night, and now he is delirious. It will soon be over, unfortunately."

"At any rate, take Garangeot as a stop-gap!" pleaded Heloise. "He has the whole press on his side—"

Just at that moment the cashier came in with a note for a thousand francs in his hand.

"Give it to madame here," said Gaudissart. "Good-day, my good woman; take good care of the dear man, and tell him that I am coming to see him to-morrow, or sometime—as soon as I can, in short."

"A drowning man," said Heloise.

"Ah, sir, hearts like yours are only found in a theatre. May God bless you!"

"To what account shall I post this item?" asked the cashier.

"I will countersign the order. Post it to the bonus account."

Before La Cibot went out, she made Mlle. Brisetout a fine courtesy, and heard Gaudissart remark to his mistress:

"Can Garangeot do the dance-music for the Mohicans in twelve days? If he helps me out of my predicament, he shall have Pons' place."





LI


La Cibot had cut off the incomes of the two friends, she had left them without means of subsistence if Pons should chance to recover, and was better rewarded for all this mischief than for any good that she had done. In a few days' time her treacherous trick would bring about the desired result—Elie Magus would have his coveted pictures. But if this first spoliation was to be effected, La Cibot must throw dust in Fraisier's eyes, and lull the suspicions of that terrible fellow-conspirator of her own seeking; and Elie Magus and Remonencq must be bound over to secrecy.

As for Remonencq, he had gradually come to feel such a passion as uneducated people can conceive when they come to Paris from the depths of the country, bringing with them all the fixed ideas bred of the solitary country life; all the ignorance of a primitive nature, all the brute appetites that become so many fixed ideas. Mme. Cibot's masculine beauty, her vivacity, her market-woman's wit, had all been remarked by the marine store-dealer. He thought at first of taking La Cibot from her husband, bigamy among the lower classes in Paris being much more common than is generally supposed; but greed was like a slip-knot drawn more and more tightly about his heart, till reason at length was stifled. When Remonencq computed that the commission paid by himself and Elie Magus amounted to about forty thousand francs, he determined to have La Cibot for his legitimate spouse, and his thoughts turned from a misdemeanor to a crime. A romantic purely speculative dream, persistently followed through a tobacco-smoker's long musings as he lounged in the doorway, had brought him to the point of wishing that the little tailor were dead. At a stroke he beheld his capital trebled; and then he thought of La Cibot. What a good saleswoman she would be! What a handsome figure she would make in a magnificent shop on the boulevards! The twofold covetousness turned Remonencq's head. In fancy he took a shop that he knew of on the Boulevard de la Madeleine, he stocked it with Pons' treasures, and then—after dreaming his dream in sheets of gold, after seeing millions in the blue spiral wreaths that rose from his pipe, he awoke to find himself face to face with the little tailor. Cibot was sweeping the yard, the doorstep, and the pavement just as his neighbor was taking down the shutters and displaying his wares; for since Pons fell ill, La Cibot's work had fallen to her husband. The Auvergnat began to look upon the little, swarthy, stunted, copper-colored tailor as the one obstacle in his way, and pondered how to be rid of him. Meanwhile this growing passion made La Cibot very proud, for she had reached an age when a woman begins to understand that she may grow old.

So early one morning, she meditatively watched Remonencq as he arranged his odds and ends for sale. She wondered how far his love could go. He came across to her.

"Well," he said, "are things going as you wish?"

"It is you who makes me uneasy," said La Cibot. "I shall be talked about; the neighbors will see you making sheep's eyes at me." She left the doorway and dived into the Auvergnat's back shop.

"What a notion!" said Remonencq.

"Come here, I have something to say to you," said La Cibot. "M. Pons' heirs are about to make a stir; they are capable of giving us a lot of trouble. God knows what might come of it if they send the lawyers here to poke their noses into the affair like hunting-dogs. I cannot get M. Schmucke to sell a few pictures unless you like me well enough to keep the secret—such a secret!—With your head on the block, you must not say where the pictures come from, nor who it was that sold them. When M. Pons is once dead and buried, you understand, nobody will know how many pictures there ought to be; if there are fifty-three pictures instead of sixty-seven, nobody will be any the wiser. Besides, if M. Pons sold them himself while he was alive, nobody can find fault."

"No," agreed Remonencq, "it is all one to me, but M. Elie Magus will want receipts in due form."

"And you shall have your receipt too, bless your life! Do you suppose that I should write them?—No, M. Schmucke will do that. But tell your Jew that he must keep the secret as closely as you do," she continued.

"We will be as mute as fishes. That is our business. I myself can read, but I cannot write, and that is why I want a capable wife that has had education like you. I have thought of nothing but earning my bread all my days, and now I wish I had some little Remonencqs. Do leave that Cibot of yours."

"Why, here comes your Jew," said the portress; "we can arrange the whole business."

Elie Magus came every third day very early in the morning to know when he could buy his pictures. "Well, my dear lady," said he, "how are we getting on?"

"Has nobody been to speak to you about M. Pons and his gim-cracks?" asked La Cibot.

"I received a letter from a lawyer," said Elie Magus, "a rascal that seems to me to be trying to work for himself; I don't like people of that sort, so I took no notice of his letter. Three days afterwards he came to see me, and left his card. I told my porter that I am never at home when he calls."

"You are a love of a Jew," said La Cibot. Little did she know Elie Magus' prudence. "Well, sonnies, in a few days' time I will bring M. Schmucke to the point of selling you seven or eight pictures, ten at most. But on two conditions.—Absolute secrecy in the first place. M. Schmucke will send for you, sir, is not that so? And M. Remonencq suggested that you might be a purchaser, eh?—And, come what may, I will not meddle in it for nothing. You are giving forty-six thousand francs for four pictures, are you not?"

"So be it," groaned the Jew.

"Very good. This is the second condition. You will give me forty-three thousand francs, and pay three thousand only to M. Schmucke; Remonencq will buy four for two thousand francs, and hand over the surplus to me.—But at the same time, you see my dear M. Magus, I am going to help you and Remonencq to a splendid bit of business—on condition that the profits are shared among the three of us. I will introduce you to that lawyer, as he, no doubt, will come here. You shall make a valuation of M. Pons' things at the prices which you can give for them, so that M. Fraisier may know how much the property is worth. But—not until after our sale, you understand!"

"I understand," said the Jew, "but it takes time to look at the things and value them."

"You shall have half a day. But, there, that is my affair. Talk it over between yourselves, my boys, and for that matter the business will be settled by the day after to-morrow. I will go round to speak to this Fraisier; for Dr. Poulain tells him everything that goes on in the house, and it is a great bother to keep that scarecrow quiet."

La Cibot met Fraisier halfway between the Rue de la Perle and the Rue de Normandie; so impatient was he to know the "elements of the case" (to use his own expression), that he was coming to see her.

"I say! I was going to you," said she.

Fraisier grumbled because Elie Magus had refused to see him. But La Cibot extinguished the spark of distrust that gleamed in the lawyer's eyes by informing him that Elie Magus had returned from a journey, and that she would arrange for an interview in Pons' rooms and for the valuation of the property; for the day after to-morrow at latest.

"Deal frankly with me," returned Fraisier. "It is more than probable that I shall act for M. Pons' next-of-kin. In that case, I shall be even better able to serve you."

The words were spoken so drily that La Cibot quaked. This starving limb of the law was sure to manoeuvre on his side as she herself was doing. She resolved forthwith to hurry on the sale of the pictures. La Cibot was right. The doctor and lawyer had clubbed together to buy a new suit of clothes in which Fraisier could decently present himself before Mme. la Presidente Camusot de Marville. Indeed, if the clothes had been ready, the interview would have taken place sooner, for the fate of the couple hung upon its issues. Fraisier left Mme. Cibot, and went to try on his new clothes. He found them waiting for him, went home, adjusted his new wig, and towards ten o'clock that morning set out in a carriage from a livery stable for the Rue de Hanovre, hoping for an audience. In his white tie, yellow gloves, and new wig, redolent of eau de Portugal, he looked something like a poisonous essence kept in a cut-glass bottle, seeming but the more deadly because everything about it is daintily neat, from the stopper covered with white kid to the label and the thread. His peremptory manner, the eruption on his blotched countenance, the green eyes, and a malignant something about him,—all these things struck the beholder with the same sense of surprise as storm-clouds in a blue sky. If in his private office, as he showed himself to La Cibot, he was the common knife that a murderer catches up for his crime,—now, at the Presidente's door, he was the daintily-wrought dagger which a woman sets among the ornaments on her what-not.





LII


A great change had taken place in the Rue de Hanovre. The Count and Countess Popinot and the young people would not allow the President and his wife to leave the house that they had settled upon their daughter to pay rent elsewhere. M. and Mme. la Presidente, therefore, were installed on the second floor, now left at liberty, for the elderly lady had made up her mind to end her days in the country. Mme. Camusot took Madeleine Vivet, with her cook and her man-servant, to the second floor, and would have been as much pinched for money as in the early days, if the house had not been rent free, and the President's salary increased to ten thousand francs. This aurea mediocritas was but little satisfactory to Mme. de Marville. Even now she wished for means more in accordance with her ambitions; for when she handed over their fortune to their daughter, she spoiled her husband's prospects. Now Amelie had set her heart upon seeing her husband in the Chamber of Deputies; she was not one of those women who find it easy to give up their way; and she by no means despaired of returning her husband for the arrondissement in which Marville is situated. So for the past two months she had teased her father-in-law, M. le Baron Camusot (for the new peer of France had been advanced to that rank), and done her utmost to extort an advance of a hundred thousand francs of the inheritance which one day would be theirs. She wanted, she said, to buy a small estate worth about two thousand francs per annum set like a wedge within the Marville lands. There she and her husband would be near their children and in their own house, while the addition would round out the Marville property. With that the Presidente laid stress upon the recent sacrifices which she and her husband had been compelled to make in order to marry Cecile to Viscount Popinot, and asked the old man how he could bar his eldest son's way to the highest honors of the magistracy, when such honors were only to be had by those who made themselves a strong position in parliament. Her husband would know how to take up such a position, he would make himself feared by those in office, and so on and so on.

"They do nothing for you unless you tighten a halter round their necks to loosen their tongues," said she. "They are ungrateful. What do they not owe to Camusot! Camusot brought the House of Orleans to the throne by enforcing the ordinances of July."

M. Camusot senior answered that he had gone out of his depth in railway speculations. He quite admitted that it was necessary to come to the rescue, but put off the day until shares should rise, as they were expected to do.

This half-promise, extracted some few days before Fraisier's visit, had plunged the Presidente into depths of affliction. It was doubtful whether the ex-proprietor of Marville was eligible for re-election without the land qualification.

Fraisier found no difficulty in obtaining speech of Madeleine Vivet; such viper natures own their kinship at once.

"I should like to see Mme. la Presidente for a few moments, mademoiselle," Fraisier said in bland accents; "I have come on a matter of business which touches her fortune; it is a question of a legacy, be sure to mention that. I have not the honor of being known to Mme. la Presidente, so my name is of no consequence. I am not in the habit of leaving my chambers, but I know the respect that is due to a President's wife, and I took the trouble of coming myself to save all possible delay."

The matter thus broached, when repeated and amplified by the waiting-maid, naturally brought a favorable answer. It was a decisive moment for the double ambition hidden in Fraisier's mind. Bold as a petty provincial attorney, sharp, rough-spoken, and curt as he was, he felt as captains feel before the decisive battle of a campaign. As he went into the little drawing-room where Amelie was waiting for him, he felt a slight perspiration breaking out upon his forehead and down his back. Every sudorific hitherto employed had failed to produce this result upon a skin which horrible diseases had left impervious. "Even if I fail to make my fortune," said he to himself, "I shall recover. Poulain said that if I could only perspire I should recover."

The Presidente came forward in her morning gown.

"Madame—" said Fraisier, stopping short to bow with the humility by which officials recognize the superior rank of the person whom they address.

"Take a seat, monsieur," said the Presidente. She saw at a glance that this was a man of law.

"Mme. la Presidente, if I take the liberty of calling your attention to a matter which concerns M. le President, it is because I am sure that M. de Marville, occupying, as he does, a high position, would leave matters to take their natural course, and so lose seven or eight hundred thousand francs, a sum which ladies (who, in my opinion, have a far better understanding of private business than the best of magistrates)—a sum which ladies, I repeat, would by no means despise—"

"You spoke of a legacy," interrupted the lady, dazzled by the wealth, and anxious to hide her surprise. Amelie de Marville, like an impatient novel-reader, wanted the end of the story.

"Yes, madame, a legacy that you are like to lose; yes, to lose altogether; but I can, that is, I could, recover it for you, if—"

"Speak out, monsieur." Mme. de Marville spoke frigidly, scanning Fraisier as she spoke with a sagacious eye.

"Madame, your eminent capacity is known to me; I was once at Mantes. M. Leboeuf, President of the Tribunal, is acquainted with M. de Marville, and can answer inquiries about me—"

The Presidente's shrug was so ruthlessly significant, that Fraisier was compelled to make short work of his parenthetic discourse.

"So distinguished a woman will at once understand why I speak of myself in the first place. It is the shortest way to the property."

To this acute observation the lady replied by a gesture. Fraisier took the sign for a permission to continue.

"I was an attorney, madame, at Mantes. My connection was all the fortune that I was likely to have. I took over M. Levroux's practice. You knew him, no doubt?"

The Presidente inclined her head.

"With borrowed capital and some ten thousand francs of my own, I went to Mantes. I had been with Desroches, one of the cleverest attorneys in Paris, I had been his head-clerk for six years. I was so unlucky as to make an enemy of the attorney for the crown at Mantes, Monsieur—"

"Olivier Vinet."

"Son of the Attorney-General, yes, madame. He was paying his court to a little person—"

"Whom?"

"Mme. Vatinelle."

"Oh! Mme. Vatinelle. She was very pretty and very—er—when I was there—"

"She was not unkind to me: inde iroe," Fraisier continued. "I was industrious; I wanted to repay my friends and to marry; I wanted work; I went in search of it; and before long I had more on my hands than anybody else. Bah! I had every soul in Mantes against me—attorneys, notaries, and even the bailiffs. They tried to fasten a quarrel on me. In our ruthless profession, as you know, madame, if you wish to ruin a man, it is soon done. I was concerned for both parties in a case, and they found it out. It was a trifle irregular; but it is sometimes done in Paris, attorneys in certain cases hand the rhubarb and take the senna. They do things differently at Mantes. I had done M. Bouyonnet this little service before; but, egged on by his colleagues and the attorney for the crown, he betrayed me.—I am keeping back nothing, you see.—There was a great hue and cry about it. I was a scoundrel; they made me out blacker than Marat; forced me to sell out; ruined me. And I am in Paris now. I have tried to get together a practice; but my health is so bad, that I have only two quiet hours out of the twenty-four. At this moment I have but one ambition, and a very small one. Some day, you will be the wife of the Keeper of the Seals, or of the Home Secretary, it may be; but I, poor and sickly as I am, desire nothing but a post in which I can live in peace for the rest of my life, a place without any opening in which to vegetate. I should like to be a justice of the peace in Paris. It would be a mere trifle for you and M. le President to gain the appointment for me; for the present Keeper of the Seals must be anxious to keep on good terms with you...

"And that is not all, madame," added Fraisier. Seeing that Mme. de Marville was about to speak, he cut her short with a gesture. "I have a friend, the doctor in attendance on the old man who ought to leave his property to M. le President. (We are coming to the point, you see.) The doctor's co-operation is indispensable, and the doctor is precisely in my position: he has abilities, he is unlucky. I learned through him how far your interests were imperiled; for even as I speak, all may be over, and the will disinheriting M. le President may have been made. This doctor wishes to be head-surgeon of a hospital or of a Government school. He must have a position in Paris equal to mine.... Pardon me if I have enlarged on a matter so delicate; but we must have no misunderstandings in this business. The doctor is, besides, much respected and learned; he saved the life of the Comtesse Popinot's great-uncle, M. Pillerault. Now, if you are so good as to promise these two posts—the appointment of justice of the peace and the sinecure for my friend—I will undertake to bring you the property, almost intact.—Almost intact, I say, for the co-operation of the legatee and several other persons is absolutely indispensable, and some obligations will be incurred. You will not redeem your promises until I have fulfilled mine."





LIII


The Presidente had folded her arms, and for the last minute or two sat like a person compelled to listen to a sermon. Now she unfolded her arms, and looked at Fraisier as she said, "Monsieur, all that you say concerning your interests has the merit of clearness; but my own interests in the matter are by no means so clear—"

"A word or two will explain everything, madame. M. le President is M. Pons' first cousin once removed, and his sole heir. M. Pons is very ill; he is about to make his will, if it is not already made, in favor of a German, a friend of his named Schmucke; and he has more than seven hundred thousand francs to leave. I hope to have an accurate valuation made in two or three days—"

"If this is so," said the Presidente, "I made a great mistake in quarreling with him and throwing the blame—" she thought aloud, amazed by the possibility of such a sum.

"No, madame. If there had been no rupture, he would be as blithe as a lark at this moment, and might outlive you and M. le President and me.... The ways of Providence are mysterious, let us not seek to fathom them," he added to palliate to some extent the hideous idea. "It cannot be helped. We men of business look at the practical aspects of things. Now you see clearly, madame, that M. de Marville in his public position would do nothing, and could do nothing, as things are. He has broken off all relations with his cousin. You see nothing now of Pons; you have forbidden him the house; you had excellent reasons, no doubt, for doing as you did, but the old man is ill, and he is leaving his property to the only friend left to him. A President of the Court of Appeal in Paris could say nothing under such circumstances if the will was made out in due form. But between ourselves, madame, when one has a right to expect seven or eight hundred thousand francs—or a million, it may be (how should I know?)—it is very unpleasant to have it slip through one's fingers, especially if one happens to be the heir-at-law.... But, on the other hand, to prevent this, one is obliged to stoop to dirty work; work so difficult, so ticklish, bringing you cheek by jowl with such low people, servants and subordinates; and into such close contact with them too, that no barrister, no attorney in Paris could take up such a case. What you want is a briefless barrister like me, a man who should have real and solid ability, who has learned to be devoted, and yet, being in a precarious position, is brought temporarily to a level with such people. In my arrondissement I undertake business for small tradespeople and working folk. Yes, madame, you see the straits to which I have been brought by the enmity of an attorney for the crown, now a deputy-public prosecutor in Paris, who could not forgive me my superiority.—I know you, madame, I know that your influence means a solid certainty; and in such a service rendered to you, I saw the end of my troubles and success for my friend Dr. Poulain."

The lady sat pensive during a moment of unspeakable torture for Fraisier. Vinet, an orator of the Centre, attorney-general (procureur-general) for the past sixteen years, nominated half-a-score of times for the chancellorship, the father, moreover, of the attorney for the crown at Mantes who had been appointed to a post in Paris within the last year—Vinet was an enemy and a rival for the malignant Presidente. The haughty attorney-general did not hide his contempt for President Camusot. This fact Fraisier did not know, and could not know.

"Have you nothing on your conscience but the fact that you were concerned for both parties?" asked she, looking steadily at Fraisier.

"Mme. la Presidente can see M. Leboeuf; M. Leboeuf was favorable to me."

"Do you feel sure that M. Leboeuf will give M. de Marville and M. le Comte Popinot a good account of you?"

"I will answer for it, especially now that M. Olivier Vinet has left Mantes; for between ourselves, good M. Leboeuf was afraid of that crabbed little official. If you will permit me, Madame La Presidente, I will go to Mantes and see M. Leboeuf. No time will be lost, for I cannot be certain of the precise value of the property for two or three days. I do not wish that you should know all the ins and outs of this affair; you ought not to know them, Mme. la Presidente, but is not the reward that I expect for my complete devotion a pledge of my success?"

"Very well. If M. Leboeuf will speak in your favor, and if the property is worth as much as you think (I doubt it myself), you shall have both appointments, if you succeed, mind you—"

"I will answer for it, madame. Only, you must be so good as to have your notary and your attorney here when I shall need them; you must give me a power of attorney to act for M. le President, and tell those gentlemen to follow my instructions, and to do nothing on their own responsibility."

"The responsibility rests with you," the Presidente answered solemnly, "so you ought to have full powers.—But is M. Pons very ill?" she asked, smiling.

"Upon my word, madame, he might pull through, especially with so conscientious a doctor as Poulain in attendance; for this friend of mine, madame, is simply an unconscious spy directed by me in your interests. Left to himself, he would save the old man's life; but there is some one else by the sickbed, a portress, who would push him into the grave for thirty thousand francs. Not that she would kill him outright; she will not give him arsenic, she is not so merciful; she will do worse, she will kill him by inches; she will worry him to death day by day. If the poor old man were kept quiet and left in peace; if he were taken into the country and cared for and made much of by friends, he would get well again; but he is harassed by a sort of Mme. Evrard. When the woman was young she was one of thirty Belles Ecailleres, famous in Paris, she is a rough, greedy, gossiping woman; she torments him to make a will and to leave her something handsome, and the end of it will be induration of the liver, calculi are possibly forming at this moment, and he has not enough strength to bear an operation. The doctor, noble soul, is in a horrible predicament. He really ought to send the woman away—"

"Why, then, this vixen is a monster!" cried the lady in thin flute-like tones.

Fraisier smiled inwardly at the likeness between himself and the terrible Presidente; he knew all about those suave modulations of a naturally sharp voice. He thought of another president, the hero of an anecdote related by Louis XI, stamped by that monarch's final praise. Blessed with a wife after the pattern of Socrates' spouse, and ungifted with the sage's philosophy, he mingled salt with the corn in the mangers and forbad the grooms to give water to the horses. As his wife rode along the Seine towards their country-house, the animals bolted into the river with the lady, and the magistrate returned thanks to Providence for ridding him of his wife "in so natural a manner." At this present moment Mme. de Marville thanked Heaven for placing at Pons' bedside a woman so likely to get him "decently" out of the way.

Aloud she said, "I would not take a million at the price of a single scruple.—Your friend ought to speak to M. Pons and have the woman sent away."

"In the first place, madame, Messrs. Schmucke and Pons think the woman an angel; they would send my friend away. And secondly, the doctor lies under an obligation to this horrid oyster-woman; she called him in to attend M. Pillerault. When he tells her to be as gentle as possible with the patient, he simply shows the creature how to make matters worse."

"What does your friend think of my cousin's condition?"

This man's clear, business-like way of putting the facts of the case frightened Mme. de Marville; she felt that his keen gaze read the thoughts of a heart as greedy as La Cibot's own.

"In six weeks the property will change hands."

The Presidente dropped her eyes.

"Poor man!" she sighed, vainly striving after a dolorous expression.

"Have you any message, madame, for M. Leboeuf? I am taking the train to Mantes."

"Yes. Wait a moment, and I will write to ask him to dine with us to-morrow. I want to see him, so that he may act in concert to repair the injustice to which you have fallen a victim."

The Presidente left the room. Fraisier saw himself a justice of the peace. He felt transformed at the thought; he grew stouter; his lungs were filled with the breath of success, the breeze of prosperity. He dipped into the mysterious reservoirs of volition for fresh and strong doses of the divine essence. To reach success, he felt, as Remonencq half felt, that he was ready for anything, for crime itself, provided that no proofs of it remained. He had faced the Presidente boldly; he had transmuted conjecture into reality; he had made assertions right and left, all to the end that she might authorize him to protect her interests and win her influence. As he stood there, he represented the infinite misery of two lives, and the no less boundless desires of two men. He spurned the squalid horrors of the Rue de la Perle. He saw the glitter of a thousand crowns in fees from La Cibot, and five thousand francs from the Presidente. This meant an abode such as befitted his future prospects. Finally, he was repaying Dr. Poulain. There are hard, ill-natured beings, goaded by distress or disease into active malignity, that yet entertain diametrically opposed sentiments with a like degree of vehemence. If Richelieu was a good hater, he was no less a good friend. Fraisier, in his gratitude, would have let himself be cut in two for Poulain. So absorbed was he in these visions of a comfortable and prosperous life, that he did not see the Presidente come in with the letter in her hand, and she, looking at him, thought him less ugly now than at first. He was about to be useful to her, and as soon as a tool belongs to us we look upon it with other eyes.

"M. Fraisier," said she, "you have convinced me of your intelligence, and I think that you can speak frankly."

Fraisier replied by an eloquent gesture.

"Very well," continued the lady, "I must ask you to give a candid reply to this question: Are we, either of us, M. de Marville or I, likely to be compromised, directly or indirectly, by your action in this matter?"

"I would not have come to you, madame, if I thought that some day I should have to reproach myself for bringing so much as a splash of mud upon you, for in your position a speck the size of a pin's head is seen by all the world. You forget, madame, that I must satisfy you if I am to be a justice of the peace in Paris. I have received one lesson at the outset of my life; it was so sharp that I do not care to lay myself open to a second thrashing. To sum it up in a last word, madame, I will not take a step in which you are indirectly involved without previously consulting you—"

"Very good. Here is the letter. And now I shall expect to be informed of the exact value of the estate."

"There is the whole matter," said Fraisier shrewdly, making his bow to the Presidente with as much graciousness as his countenance could exhibit.

"What a providence!" thought Mme. Camusot de Marville. "So I am to be rich! Camusot will be sure of his election if we let loose this Fraisier upon the Bolbec constituency. What a tool!"

"What a providence!" Fraisier said to himself as he descended the staircase; "and what a sharp woman Mme. Camusot is! I should want a woman in these circumstances. Now to work!"

And he departed for Mantes to gain the good graces of a man he scarcely knew; but he counted upon Mme. Vatinelle, to whom, unfortunately, he owed all his troubles—and some troubles are of a kind that resemble a protested bill while the defaulter is yet solvent, in that they bear interest.





LIV


Three days afterwards, while Schmucke slept (for in accordance with the compact he now sat up at night with the patient), La Cibot had a "tiff," as she was pleased to call it, with Pons. It will not be out of place to call attention to one particularly distressing symptom of liver complaint. The sufferer is always more or less inclined to impatience and fits of anger; an outburst of this kind seems to give relief at the time, much as a patient while the fever fit is upon him feels that he has boundless strength; but collapse sets in so soon as the excitement passes off, and the full extent of mischief sustained by the system is discernible. This is especially the case when the disease has been induced by some great shock; and the prostration is so much the more dangerous because the patient is kept upon a restricted diet. It is a kind of fever affecting neither the blood nor the brain, but the humoristic mechanism, fretting the whole system, producing melancholy, in which the patient hates himself; in such a crisis anything may cause dangerous irritation. In spite of all that the doctor could say, La Cibot had no belief in this wear and tear of the nervous system by the humoristic. She was a woman of the people, without experience or education; Dr. Poulain's explanations for her were simply "doctor's notions." Like most of her class, she thought that sick people must be fed, and nothing short of Dr. Poulain's direct order prevented her from administering ham, a nice omelette, or vanilla chocolate upon the sly. The infatuation of the working classes on this point is very strong. The reason of their reluctance to enter a hospital is the idea that they will be starved there. The mortality caused by the food smuggled in by the wives of patients on visiting-days was at one time so great that the doctors were obliged to institute a very strict search for contraband provisions. If La Cibot was to realize her profits at once, a momentary quarrel must be worked up in some way. She began by telling Pons about her visit to the theatre, not omitting her passage at arms with Mlle. Heloise the dancer.

"But why did you go?" the invalid asked for the third time. La Cibot once launched on a stream of words, he was powerless to stop her.

"So, then, when I had given her a piece of my mind, Mademoiselle Heloise saw who I was and knuckled under, and we were the best of friends.—And now do you ask me why I went?" she added, repeating Pons' question.

There are certain babblers, babblers of genius are they, who sweep up interruptions, objections, and observations in this way as they go along, by way of provision to swell the matter of their conversation, as if that source were ever in any danger of running dry.

"Why I went?" repeated she. "I went to get your M. Gaudissart out of a fix. He wants some music for a ballet, and you are hardly fit to scribble on sheets of paper and do your work, dearie.—So I understood, things being so, that a M. Garangeot was to be asked to set the Mohicans to music—"

"Garangeot!" roared Pons in fury. "Garangeot! a man with no talent; I would not have him for first violin! He is very clever, he is very good at musical criticism, but as to composing—I doubt it! And what the devil put the notion of going to the theatre into your head?"

"How confoundedly contrairy the man is! Look here, dearie, we mustn't boil over like milk on the fire! How are you to write music in the state that you are in? Why, you can't have looked at yourself in the glass! Will you have the glass and see? You are nothing but skin and bone—you are as weak as a sparrow, and do you think that you are fit to make your notes! why, you would not so much as make out mine.... And that reminds me that I ought to go up to the third floor lodger's that owes us seventeen francs, for when the chemist has been paid we shall not have twenty left.—So I had to tell M. Gaudissart (I like that name), a good sort he seems to be,—a regular Roger Bontemps that would just suit me.—He will never have liver complaint!—Well, so I had to tell him how you were.—Lord! you are not well, and he has put some one else in your place for a bit—"

"Some one else in my place!" cried Pons in a terrible voice, as he sat right up in bed.

Sick people, generally speaking, and those most particularly who lie within the sweep of the scythe of Death, cling to their places with the same passionate energy that the beginner displays to gain a start in life. To hear that someone had taken his place was like a foretaste of death to the dying man.

"Why, the doctor told me that I was going on as well as possible," continued he; "he said that I should soon be about again as usual. You have killed me, ruined me, murdered me!"

"Tut, tut, tut!" cried La Cibot, "there you go! I am killing you, am I? Mercy on us! these are the pretty things that you are always telling M. Schmucke when my back is turned. I hear all that you say, that I do! You are a monster of ingratitude."

"But you do not know that if I am only away for another fortnight, they will tell me that I have had my day, that I am old-fashioned, out of date, Empire, rococo, when I go back. Garangeot will have made friends all over the theatre, high and low. He will lower the pitch to suit some actress that cannot sing, he will lick M. Gaudissart's boots!" cried the sick man, who clung to life. "He has friends that will praise him in all the newspapers; and when things are like that in such a shop, Mme. Cibot, they can find holes in anybody's coat.... What fiend drove you to do it?"

"Why! plague take it, M. Schmucke talked it over with me for a week. What would you have? You see nothing but yourself! You are so selfish that other people may die if you can only get better.—Why poor M. Schmucke has been tired out this month past! he is tied by the leg, he can go nowhere, he cannot give lessons nor take his place at the theatre. Do you really see nothing? He sits up with you at night, and I take the nursing in the day. If I were to sit up at night with you, as I tried to do at first when I thought you were so poor, I should have to sleep all day. And who would see to the house and look out for squalls! Illness is illness, it cannot be helped, and here are you—"

"This was not Schmucke's idea, it is quite impossible—"

"That means that it was I who took it into my head to do it, does it? Do you think that we are made of iron? Why, if M. Schmucke had given seven or eight lessons every day and conducted the orchestra every evening at the theatre from six o'clock till half-past eleven at night, he would have died in ten days' time. Poor man, he would give his life for you, and do you want to be the death of him? By the authors of my days, I have never seen a sick man to match you! Where are your senses? have you put them in pawn? We are all slaving our lives out for you; we do all for the best, and you are not satisfied! Do you want to drive us raging mad? I myself, to begin with, am tired out as it is——"

La Cibot rattled on at her ease; Pons was too angry to say a word. He writhed on his bed, painfully uttering inarticulate sounds; the blow was killing him. And at this point, as usual, the scolding turned suddenly to tenderness. The nurse dashed at her patient, grasped him by the head, made him lie down by main force, and dragged the blankets over him.

"How any one can get into such a state!" exclaimed she. "After all, it is your illness, dearie. That is what good M. Poulain says. See now, keep quiet and be good, my dear little sonny. Everybody that comes near you worships you, and the doctor himself comes to see you twice a day. What would he say if he found you in such a way? You put me out of all patience; you ought not to behave like this. If you have Ma'am Cibot to nurse you, you should treat her better. You shout and you talk!—you ought not to do it, you know that. Talking irritates you. And why do you fly into a passion? The wrong is all on your side; you are always bothering me. Look here, let us have it out! If M. Schmucke and I, who love you like our life, thought that we were doing right—well, my cherub, it was right, you may be sure."

"Schmucke never could have told you to go to the theatre without speaking to me about it—"

"And must I wake him, poor dear, when he is sleeping like one of the blest, and call him in as a witness?"

"No, no!" cried Pons. "If my kind and loving Schmucke made the resolution, perhaps I am worse than I thought." His eyes wandered round the room, dwelling on the beautiful things in it with a melancholy look painful to see. "So I must say good-bye to my dear pictures, to all the things that have come to be like so many friends to me... and to my divine friend Schmucke?... Oh! can it be true?"

La Cibot, acting her heartless comedy, held her handkerchief to her eyes; and at that mute response the sufferer fell to dark musing—so sorely stricken was he by the double stab dealt to health and his interests by the loss of his post and the near prospect of death, that he had no strength left for anger. He lay, ghastly and wan, like a consumptive patient after a wrestling bout with the Destroyer.

"In M. Schmucke's interests, you see, you would do well to send for M. Trognon; he is the notary of the quarter and a very good man," said La Cibot, seeing that her victim was completely exhausted.

"You are always talking about this Trognon—"

"Oh! he or another, it is all one to me, for anything you will leave me."

She tossed her head to signify that she despised riches. There was silence in the room.

A moment later Schmucke came in. He had slept for six hours, hunger awakened him, and now he stood at Pons' bedside watching his friend without saying a word, for Mme. Cibot had laid a finger on her lips. "Hush!" she whispered.

Then she rose and went up to add under her breath, "He is going off to sleep at last, thank Heaven! He is as cross as a red donkey!—What can you expect, he is struggling with his illness——"

"No, on the contrary, I am very patient," said the victim in a weary voice that told of a dreadful exhaustion; "but, oh! Schmucke, my dear friend, she has been to the theatre to turn me out of my place."

There was a pause. Pons was too weak to say more. La Cibot took the opportunity and tapped her head significantly. "Do not contradict him," she said to Schmucke; "it would kill him."

Pons gazed into Schmucke's honest face. "And she says that you sent her—" he continued.

"Yes," Schmucke affirmed heroically. "It had to pe. Hush!—Let us safe your life. It is absurd to vork and train your sdrength gif you haf a dreasure. Get better; ve vill sell some prick-a-prack und end our tays kvietly in a corner somveres, mit kind Montame Zipod."

"She has perverted you," moaned Pons.

Mme. Cibot had taken up her station behind the bed to make signals unobserved. Pons thought that she had left the room. "She is murdering me," he added.

"What is that? I am murdering you, am I?" cried La Cibot, suddenly appearing, hand on hips and eyes aflame. "I am as faithful as a dog, and this is all I get! God Almighty!—"

She burst into tears and dropped down into the great chair, a tragical movement which wrought a most disastrous revulsion in Pons.

"Very good," she said, rising to her feet. The woman's malignant eyes looked poison and bullets at the two friends. "Very good. Nothing that I can do is right here, and I am tired of slaving my life out. You shall take a nurse."

Pons and Schmucke exchanged glances in dismay.

"Oh! you may look at each other like actors. I mean it. I shall ask Dr. Poulain to find a nurse for you. And now we will settle accounts. You shall pay me back the money that I have spent on you, and that I would never have asked you for, I that have gone to M. Pillerault to borrow another five hundred francs of him—"

"It ees his illness!" cried Schmucke—he sprang to Mme. Cibot and put an arm round her waist—"haf batience."

"As for you, you are an angel, I could kiss the ground you tread upon," said she. "But M. Pons never liked me, he always hated me. Besides, he thinks perhaps that I want to be mentioned in his will—"

"Hush! you vill kill him!" cried Schmucke.

"Good-bye, sir," said La Cibot, with a withering look at Pons. "You may keep well for all the harm I wish you. When you can speak to me pleasantly, when you can believe that what I do is done for the best, I will come back again. Till then I shall stay in my own room. You were like my own child to me; did anybody ever see a child revolt against its mother?... No, no, M. Schmucke, I do not want to hear more. I will bring you your dinner and wait upon you, but you must take a nurse. Ask M. Poulain about it."

And she went out, slamming the door after her so violently that the precious, fragile objects in the room trembled. To Pons in his torture, the rattle of china was like the final blow dealt by the executioner to a victim broken on the wheel.

An hour later La Cibot called to Schmucke through the door, telling him that his dinner was waiting for him in the dining-room. She would not cross the threshold. Poor Schmucke went out to her with a haggard, tear-stained face.

"Mein boor Bons in vandering," said he; "he says dat you are ein pad voman. It ees his illness," he added hastily, to soften La Cibot and excuse his friend.

"Oh, I have had enough of his illness! Look here, he is neither father, nor husband, nor brother, nor child of mine. He has taken a dislike to me; well and good, that is enough! As for you, you see, I would follow you to the end of the world; but when a woman gives her life, her heart, and all her savings, and neglects her husband (for here has Cibot fallen ill), and then hears that she is a bad woman—it is coming it rather too strong, it is."

"Too shtrong?"

"Too strong, yes. Never mind idle words. Let us come to the facts. As to that, you owe me for three months at a hundred and ninety francs—that is five hundred seventy francs; then there is the rent that I have paid twice (here are the receipts), six hundred more, including rates and the sou in the franc for the porter—something under twelve hundred francs altogether, and with the two thousand francs besides—without interest, mind you—the total amounts to three thousand one hundred and ninety-two francs. And remember that you will want at least two thousand francs before long for the doctor, and the nurse, and the medicine, and the nurse's board. That was why I borrowed a thousand francs of M. Pillerault," and with that she held up Gaudissart's bank-note.

It may readily be conceived that Schmucke listened to this reckoning with amazement, for he knew about as much of business as a cat knows of music.

"Montame Zipod," he expostulated, "Bons haf lost his head. Bardon him, and nurse him as before, und pe our profidence; I peg it of you on mine knees," and he knelt before La Cibot and kissed the tormentor's hands.

La Cibot raised Schmucke and kissed him on the forehead. "Listen, my lamb," said she, "here is Cibot ill in bed; I have just sent for Dr. Poulain. So I ought to set my affairs in order. And what is more, Cibot saw me crying, and flew into such a passion that he will not have me set foot in here again. It is he who wants the money; it is his, you see. We women can do nothing when it comes to that. But if you let him have his money back again—the three thousand two hundred francs—he will be quiet perhaps. Poor man, it is his all, earned by the sweat of his brow, the savings of twenty-six years of life together. He must have his money to-morrow; there is no getting round him.—You do not know Cibot; when he is angry he would kill a man. Well, I might perhaps get leave of him to look after you both as before. Be easy. I will just let him say anything that comes into his head. I will bear it all for love of you, an angel as you are."

"No, I am ein boor man, dot lof his friend and vould gif his life to save him—"

"But the money?" broke in La Cibot. "My good M. Schmucke, let us suppose that you pay me nothing; you will want three thousand francs, and where are they to come from? Upon my word, do you know what I should do in your place? I should not think twice, I should just sell seven or eight good-for-nothing pictures and put up some of those instead that are standing in your closet with their faces to the wall for want of room. One picture or another, what difference does it make?"

"Und vy?"

"He is so cunning. It is his illness, for he is a lamb when he is well. He is capable of getting up and prying about; and if by any chance he went into the salon, he is so weak that he could not go beyond the door; he would see that they are all still there."

"Drue!"

"And when he is quite well, we will tell him about the sale. And if you wish to confess, throw it all upon me, say that you were obliged to pay me. Come! I have a broad back—"

"I cannot tispose of dings dot are not mine," the good German answered simply.

"Very well. I will summons you, you and M. Pons."

"It vould kill him—"

"Take your choice! Dear me, sell the pictures and tell him about it afterwards... you can show him the summons—"

"Ver' goot. Summons us. Dot shall pe mine egscuse. I shall show him der chudgment."

Mme. Cibot went down to the court, and that very day at seven o'clock she called to Schmucke. Schmucke found himself confronted with M.Tabareau the bailiff, who called upon him to pay. Schmucke made answer, trembling from head to foot, and was forthwith summoned together with Pons, to appear in the county court to hear judgment against him. The sight of the bailiff and a bit of stamped paper covered with scrawls produced such an effect upon Schmucke, that he held out no longer.

"Sell die bictures," he said, with tears in his eyes.

Next morning, at six o'clock, Elie Magus and Remonencq took down the paintings of their choice. Two receipts for two thousand five hundred francs were made out in correct form:—

"I, the undersigned, representing M. Pons, acknowledge the receipt of two thousand five hundred francs from M. Elie Magus for the four pictures sold to him, the said sum being appropriated to the use of M. Pons. The first picture, attributed to Durer, is a portrait of a woman; the second, likewise a portrait, is of the Italian School; the third, a Dutch landscape by Breughel; and the fourth, a Holy Family by an unknown master of the Florentine School."

Remonencq's receipt was worded in precisely the same way; a Greuze, a Claude Lorraine, a Rubens, and a Van Dyck being disguised as pictures of the French and Flemish schools.

"Der monny makes me beleef dot the chimcracks haf som value," said Schmucke when the five thousand francs were paid over.

"They are worth something," said Remonencq. "I would willingly give you a hundred thousand francs for the lot."

Remonencq, asked to do a trifling service, hung eight pictures of the proper size in the same frames, taking them from among the less valuable pictures in Schmucke's bedroom.





LVI


No sooner was Elie Magus in possession of the four great pictures than he went, taking La Cibot with him, under pretence of settling accounts. But he pleaded poverty, he found fault with the pictures, they needed rebacking, he offered La Cibot thirty thousand francs by way of commission, and finally dazzled her with the sheets of paper on which the Bank of France engraves the words "One thousand francs" in capital letters. Magus thereupon condemned Remonencq to pay the like sum to La Cibot, by lending him the money on the security of his four pictures, which he took with him as a guarantee. So glorious were they, that Magus could not bring himself to part with them, and next day he bought them of Remonencq for six thousand francs over and above the original price, and an invoice was duly made out for the four. Mme. Cibot, the richer by sixty-eight thousand francs, once more swore her two accomplices to absolute secrecy. Then she asked the Jew's advice. She wanted to invest the money in such a way that no one should know of it.

"Buy shares in the Orleans Railway," said he; "they are thirty francs below par, you will double your capital in three years. They will give you scraps of paper, which you keep safe in a portfolio."

"Stay here, M. Magus. I will go and fetch the man of business who acts for M. Pons' family. He wants to know how much you will give him for the whole bag of tricks upstairs. I will go for him now."

"If only she were a widow!" said Remonencq when she was gone. "She would just suit me; she will have plenty of money now—"

"Especially if she puts her money into the Orleans Railway; she will double her capital in two years' time. I have put all my poor little savings into it," added the Jew, "for my daughter's portion.—Come, let us take a turn on the boulevard until this lawyer arrives."

"Cibot is very bad as it is," continued Remonencq; "if it should please God to take him to Himself, I should have a famous wife to keep a shop; I could set up on a large scale—"

"Good-day, M. Fraisier," La Cibot began in an ingratiating tone as she entered her legal adviser's office. "Why, what is this that your porter has been telling me? are you going to move?"

"Yes, my dear Mme. Cibot. I am taking the first floor above Dr. Poulain, and trying to borrow two or three thousand francs so as to furnish the place properly; it is very nice, upon my word, the landlord has just papered and painted it. I am acting, as I told you, in President de Marville's interests and yours.... I am not a solicitor now; I mean to have my name entered on the roll of barristers, and I must be well lodged. A barrister in Paris cannot have his name on the rolls unless he has decent furniture and books and the like. I am a doctor of law, I have kept my terms, and have powerful interest already.... Well, how are we getting on?"

"Perhaps you would accept my savings," said La Cibot. "I have put them in a savings bank. I have not much, only three thousand francs, the fruits of twenty-five years of stinting and scraping. You might give me a bill of exchange, as Remonencq says; for I am ignorant myself, I only know what they tell me."

"No. It is against the rules of the guild for a barrister (avocat) to put his name to a bill. I will give you a receipt, bearing interest at five per cent per annum, on the understanding that if I make an income of twelve hundred francs for you out of old Pons' estate you will cancel it."

La Cibot, caught in the trap, uttered not a word.

"Silence gives consent," Fraisier continued. "Let me have it to-morrow morning."

"Oh! I am quite willing to pay fees in advance," said La Cibot; "it is one way of making sure of my money."

Fraisier nodded. "How are you getting on?" he repeated. "I saw Poulain yesterday; you are hurrying your invalid along, it seems.... One more scene such as yesterday's, and gall-stones will form. Be gentle with him, my dear Mme. Cibot, do not lay up remorse for yourself. Life is not too long."

"Just let me alone with your remorse! Are you going to talk about the guillotine again? M. Pons is a contrairy old thing. You don't know him. It is he that bothers me. There is not a more cross-grained man alive; his relations are in the right of it, he is sly, revengeful, and contrairy.... M. Magus has come, as I told you, and is waiting to see you."

"Right! I will be there as soon as you. Your income depends upon the price the collection will fetch. If it brings in eight hundred thousand francs, you shall have fifteen hundred francs a year. It is a fortune."

"Very well. I will tell them to value the things on their consciences."

An hour later, Pons was fast asleep. The doctor had ordered a soothing draught, which Schmucke administered, all unconscious that La Cibot had doubled the dose. Fraisier, Remonencq, and Magus, three gallows-birds, were examining the seventeen hundred different objects which formed the old musician's collection one by one. Schmucke had gone to bed. The three kites, drawn by the scent of a corpse, were masters of the field.

"Make no noise," said La Cibot whenever Magus went into ecstasies or explained the value of some work of art to Remonencq.

The dying man slept on in the neighboring room, while greed in four different forms appraised the treasures that he must leave behind, and waited impatiently for him to die—a sight to wring the heart. Three hours went by before they had finished the salon.

"On an average," said the grimy old Jew, "everything here is worth a thousand francs."

"Seventeen hundred thousand francs!" exclaimed Fraisier in be-wilderment.

"Not to me," Magus answered promptly, and his eyes grew dull. "I would not give more than a hundred thousand francs myself for the collection. You cannot tell how long you may keep a thing on hand.... There are masterpieces that wait ten years for a buyer, and meanwhile the purchase money is doubled by compound interest. Still, I should pay cash."

"There is stained glass in the other room, as well as enamels and miniatures and gold and silver snuff-boxes," put in Remonencq.

"Can they be seen?" inquired Fraisier.

"I'll see if he is sound asleep," replied La Cibot. She made a sign, and the three birds of prey came in.

"There are masterpieces yonder!" said Magus, indicating the salon, every bristle of his white beard twitching as he spoke. "But the riches are here! And what riches! Kings have nothing more glorious in royal treasuries."

Remonencq's eyes lighted up till they glowed like carbuncles, at the sight of the gold snuff-boxes. Fraisier, cool and calm as a serpent, or some snake-creature with the power of rising erect, stood with his viper head stretched out, in such an attitude as a painter would choose for Mephistopheles. The three covetous beings, thirsting for gold as devils thirst for the dew of heaven, looked simultaneously, as it chanced, at the owner of all this wealth. Some nightmare troubled Pons; he stirred, and suddenly, under the influence of those diabolical glances, he opened his eyes with a shrill cry.

"Thieves!... There they are!... Help! Murder! Help!"

The nightmare was evidently still upon him, for he sat up in bed, staring before him with blank, wide-open eyes, and had not the power to move.

Elie Magus and Remonencq made for the door, but a word glued them to the spot.

"Magus here!... I am betrayed!"

Instinctively the sick man had known that his beloved pictures were in danger, a thought that touched him at least as closely as any dread for himself, and he awoke. Fraisier meanwhile did not stir.

"Mme. Cibot! who is that gentleman?" cried Pons, shivering at the sight.

"Goodness me! how could I put him out of the door?" she inquired, with a wink and gesture for Fraisier's benefit. "This gentleman came just a minute ago, from your family."

Fraisier could not conceal his admiration for La Cibot.

"Yes, sir," he said, "I have come on behalf of Mme. la Presidente de Marville, her husband, and her daughter, to express their regret. They learned quite by accident that you are ill, and they would like to nurse you themselves. They want you to go to Marville and get well there. Mme. la Vicomtesse Popinot, the little Cecile that you love so much, will be your nurse. She took your part with her mother. She convinced Mme. de Marville that she had made a mistake."

"So my next-of-kin have sent you to me, have they?" Pons exclaimed indignantly, "and sent the best judge and expert in all Paris with you to show you the way? Oh! a nice commission!" he cried, bursting into wild laughter. "You have come to value my pictures and curiosities, my snuff-boxes and miniatures!... Make your valuation. You have a man there who understands everything, and more—he can buy everything, for he is a millionaire ten times over.... My dear relatives will not have long to wait," he added, with bitter irony, "they have choked the last breath out of me.... Ah! Mme. Cibot, you said you were a mother to me, and you bring dealers into the house, and my competitor and the Camusots, while I am asleep!... Get out, all of you!—"

The unhappy man was beside himself with anger and fear; he rose from the bed and stood upright, a gaunt, wasted figure.

"Take my arm, sir," said La Cibot, rushing to the rescue, lest Pons should fall. "Pray calm yourself, the gentlemen are gone."

"I want to see the salon...." said the death-stricken man.

La Cibot made a sign to the three ravens to take flight. Then she caught up Pons as if he had been a feather, and put him in bed again, in spite of his cries. When she saw that he was quite helpless and exhausted, she went to shut the door on the staircase. The three who had done Pons to death were still on the landing; La Cibot told them to wait. She heard Fraisier say to Magus:

"Let me have it in writing, and sign it, both of you. Undertake to pay nine hundred thousand francs in cash for M. Pons' collection, and we will see about putting you in the way of making a handsome profit."

With that he said something to La Cibot in a voice so low that the others could not catch it, and went down after the two dealers to the porter's room.





LVII


"Have they gone, Mme. Cibot?" asked the unhappy Pons, when she came back again.

"Gone?... who?" asked she.

"Those men."

"What men? There, now, you have seen men," said she. "You have just had a raving fit; if it hadn't been for me you would have gone out the window, and now you are still talking of men in the room. Is it always to be like this?"

"What! was there not a gentleman here just now, saying that my relatives had sent him?"

"Will you still stand me out?" said she. "Upon my word, do you know where you ought to be sent?—To the asylum at Charenton. You see men—"

"Elie Magus, Remonencq, and—"

"Oh! as for Remonencq, you may have seen him, for he came up to tell me that my poor Cibot is so bad that I must clear out of this and come down. My Cibot comes first, you see. When my husband is ill, I can think of nobody else. Try to keep quiet and sleep for a couple of hours; I have sent for Dr. Poulain, and I will come up with him.... Take a drink and be good—"

"Then was there no one in the room just now, when I waked?..."

"No one," said she. "You must have seen M. Remonencq in one of your looking-glasses."

"You are right, Mme. Cibot," said Pons, meek as a lamb.

"Well, now you are sensible again.... Good-bye, my cherub; keep quiet, I shall be back again in a minute."

When Pons heard the outer door close upon her, he summoned up all his remaining strength to rise.

"They are cheating me," he muttered to himself, "they are robbing me! Schmucke is a child that would let them tie him up in a sack."

The terrible scene had seemed so real, it could not be a dream, he thought; a desire to throw light upon the puzzle excited him; he managed to reach the door, opened it after many efforts, and stood on the threshold of his salon. There they were—his dear pictures, his statues, his Florentine bronzes, his porcelain; the sight of them revived him. The old collector walked in his dressing-gown along the narrow spaces between the credence-tables and the sideboards that lined the wall; his feet bare, his head on fire. His first glance of ownership told him that everything was there; he turned to go back to bed again, when he noticed that a Greuze portrait looked out of the frame that had held Sebastian del Piombo's Templar. Suspicion flashed across his brain, making his dark thoughts apparent to him, as a flash of lightning marks the outlines of the cloud-bars on a stormy sky. He looked round for the eight capital pictures of the collection; each one of them was replaced by another. A dark film suddenly overspread his eyes; his strength failed him; he fell fainting upon the polished floor. So heavy was the swoon, that for two hours he lay as he fell, till Schmucke awoke and went to see his friend, and found him lying unconscious in the salon. With endless pains Schmucke raised the half-dead body and laid it on the bed; but when he came to question the death-stricken man, and saw the look in the dull eyes and heard the vague, inarticulate words, the good German, so far from losing his head, rose to the very heroism of friendship. Man and child as he was, with the pressure of despair came the inspiration of a mother's tenderness, a woman's love. He warmed towels (he found towels!), he wrapped them about Pons' hands, he laid them over the pit of the stomach; he took the cold, moist forehead in his hands, he summoned back life with a might of will worthy of Apollonius of Tyana, laying kisses on his friend's eyelids like some Mary bending over the dead Christ, in a pieta carved in bas-relief by some great Italian sculptor. The divine effort, the outpouring of one life into another, the work of mother and of lover, was crowned with success. In half an hour the warmth revived Pons; he became himself again, the hues of life returned to his eyes, suspended faculties gradually resumed their play under the influence of artificial heat; Schmucke gave him balm-water with a little wine in it; the spirit of life spread through the body; intelligence lighted up the forehead so short a while ago insensible as a stone; and Pons knew that he had been brought back to life, by what sacred devotion, what might of friendship!

"But for you, I should die," he said, and as he spoke he felt the good German's tears falling on his face. Schmucke was laughing and crying at once. Poor Schmucke! he had waited for those words with a frenzy of hope as costly as the frenzy of despair; and now his strength utterly failed him, he collapsed like a rent balloon. It was his turn to fall; he sank into the easy-chair, clasped his hands, and thanked God in fervent prayer. For him a miracle had just been wrought. He put no belief in the efficacy of the prayer of his deeds; the miracle had been wrought by God in direct answer to his cry. And yet that miracle was a natural effect, such as medical science often records.

A sick man, surrounded by those who love him, nursed by those who wish earnestly that he should live, will recover (other things being equal), when another patient tended by hirelings will die. Doctors decline to see unconscious magnetism in this phenomenon; for them it is the result of intelligent nursing, of exact obedience to their orders; but many a mother knows the virtue of such ardent projection of strong, unceasing prayer.

"My good Schmucke—"

"Say nodings; I shall hear you mit mein heart... rest, rest!" said Schmucke, smiling at him.

"Poor friend, noble creature, child of God, living in God!... The one being that has loved me...." The words came out with pauses between them; there was a new note, a something never heard before, in Pons' voice. All the soul, so soon to take flight, found utterance in the words that filled Schmucke with happiness almost like a lover's rapture.

"Yes, yes. I shall be shtrong as a lion. I shall vork for two!"

"Listen, my good, my faithful, adorable friend. Let me speak, I have not much time left. I am a dead man. I cannot recover from these repeated shocks."

Schmucke was crying like a child.

"Just listen," continued Pons, "and cry afterwards. As a Christian, you must submit. I have been robbed. It is La Cibot's doing.... I ought to open your eyes before I go; you know nothing of life.... Somebody has taken away eight of the pictures, and they were worth a great deal of money."

"Vorgif me—I sold dem."

"You sold them?"

"Yes, I," said poor Schmucke. "Dey summoned us to der court—"

"Summoned?.... Who summoned us?"

"Wait," said Schmucke. He went for the bit of stamped-paper left by the bailiff, and gave it to Pons.

Pons read the scrawl through with close attention, then he let the paper drop and lay quite silent for a while. A close observer of the work of men's hands, unheedful so far of the workings of the brain, Pons finally counted out the threads of the plot woven about him by La Cibot. The artist's fire, the intellect that won the Roman scholarship—all his youth came back to him for a little.

"My good Schmucke," he said at last, "you must do as I tell you, and obey like a soldier. Listen! go downstairs into the lodge and tell that abominable woman that I should like to see the person sent to me by my cousin the President; and that unless he comes, I shall leave my collection to the Musee. Say that a will is in question."

Schmucke went on his errand; but at the first word, La Cibot answered by a smile.

"My good M. Schmucke, our dear invalid has had a delirious fit; he thought that there were men in the room. On my word, as an honest woman, no one has come from the family."

Schmucke went back with his answer, which he repeated word for word.

"She is cleverer, more astute and cunning and wily, than I thought," said Pons with a smile. "She lies even in her room. Imagine it! This morning she brought a Jew here, Elie Magus by name, and Remonencq, and a third whom I do not know, more terrific than the other two put together. She meant to make a valuation while I was asleep; I happened to wake, and saw them all three, estimating the worth of my snuff-boxes. The stranger said, indeed, that the Camusots had sent him here; I spoke to him.... That shameless woman stood me out that I was dreaming!... My good Schmucke, it was not a dream. I heard the man perfectly plainly; he spoke to me.... The two dealers took fright and made for the door.... I thought that La Cibot would contradict herself—the experiment failed.... I will lay another snare, and trap the wretched woman.... Poor Schmucke, you think that La Cibot is an angel; and for this month past she has been killing me by inches to gain her covetous ends. I would not believe that a woman who served us faithfully for years could be so wicked. That doubt has been my ruin.... How much did the eight pictures fetch?"

"Vife tausend vrancs."

"Good heavens! they were worth twenty times as much!" cried Pons; "the gems of the collection! I have not time now to institute proceedings; and if I did, you would figure in court as the dupe of those rascals.... A lawsuit would be the death of you. You do not know what justice means—a court of justice is a sink of iniquity.... At the sight of such horrors, a soul like yours would give way. And besides, you will have enough. The pictures cost me forty thousand francs. I have had them for thirty-six years.... Oh, we have been robbed with surprising dexterity. I am on the brink of the grave, I care for nothing now but thee—for thee, the best soul under the sun.... I will not have you plundered; all that I have is yours. So you must trust nobody, Schmucke, you that have never suspected any one in your life. I know God watches over you, but He may forget for one moment, and you will be seized like a vessel among pirates.... La Cibot is a monster! She is killing me; and you think her an angel! You shall see what she is. Go and ask her to give you the name of a notary, and I will show you her with her hand in the bag."

Schmucke listened as if Pons proclaimed an apocalypse. Could so depraved a creature as La Cibot exist? If Pons was right, it seemed to imply that there was no God in the world. He went right down again to Mme. Cibot.

"Mein boor vriend Bons feel so ill," he said, "dat he vish to make his vill. Go und pring ein nodary."

This was said in the hearing of several persons, for Cibot's life was despaired of. Remonencq and his sister, two women from neighboring porters' lodges, two or three servants, and the lodger from the first floor on the side next the street, were all standing outside in the gateway.

"Oh! you can just fetch a notary yourself, and have your will made as you please," cried La Cibot, with tears in her eyes. "My poor Cibot is dying, and it is no time to leave him. I would give all the Ponses in the world to save Cibot, that has never given me an ounce of unhappiness in these thirty years since we were married."

And in she went, leaving Schmucke in confusion.

"Is M. Pons really seriously ill, sir?" asked the first-floor lodger, one Jolivard, a clerk in the registrar's office at the Palais de Justice.

"He nearly died chust now," said Schmucke, with deep sorrow in his voice.

"M. Trognon lives near by in the Rue Saint-Louis," said M. Jolivard, "he is the notary of the quarter."

"Would you like me to go for him?" asked Remonencq.

"I should pe fery glad," said Schmucke; "for gif Montame Zipod cannot pe mit mine vriend, I shall not vish to leaf him in der shtate he is in—"

"Mme. Cibot told us that he was going out of his mind," resumed Jolivard.

"Bons! out off his mind!" cried Schmucke, terror-stricken by the idea. "Nefer vas he so clear in der head... dat is chust der reason vy I am anxious for him."

The little group of persons listened to the conversation with a very natural curiosity, which stamped the scene upon their memories.

Schmucke did not know Fraisier, and could not note his satanic countenance and glittering eyes. But two words whispered by Fraisier in La Cibot's ear had prompted a daring piece of acting, somewhat beyond La Cibot's range, it may be, though she played her part throughout in a masterly style. To make others believe that the dying man was out of his mind—it was the very corner-stone of the edifice reared by the petty lawyer.

The morning's incident had done Fraisier good service; but for him, La Cibot in her trouble might have fallen into the snare innocently spread by Schmucke, when he asked her to send back the person sent by the family.





LVIII


Remonencq saw Dr. Poulain coming towards them, and asked no better than to vanish. The fact was that for the last ten days the Auvergnat had been playing Providence in a manner singularly displeasing to Justice, which claims the monopoly of that part. He had made up his mind to rid himself at all costs of the one obstacle in his way to happiness, and happiness for him meant capital trebled and marriage with the irresistibly charming portress. He had watched the little tailor drinking his herb-tea, and a thought struck him. He would convert the ailment into mortal sickness; his stock of old metals supplied him with the means.

One morning as he leaned against the door-post, smoking his pipe and dreaming of that fine shop on the Boulevard de la Madeleine where Mme. Cibot, gorgeously arrayed, should some day sit enthroned, his eyes fell upon a copper disc, about the size of a five-franc piece, covered thickly with verdigris. The economical idea of using Cibot's medicine to clean the disc immediately occurred to him. He fastened the thing in a bit of twine, and came over every morning to inquire for tidings of his friend the tailor, timing his visit during La Cibot's visit to her gentlemen upstairs. He dropped the disc into the tumbler, allowed it to steep there while he talked, and drew it out again by the string when he went away. The trace of tarnished copper, commonly called verdigris, poisoned the wholesome draught; a minute dose administered by stealth did incalculable mischief. Behold the results of this criminal homoeopathy! On the third day poor Cibot's hair came out, his teeth were loosened in their sockets, his whole system was deranged by a scarcely perceptible trace of poison. Dr. Poulain racked his brains. He was enough of a man of science to see that some destructive agent was at work. He privately carried off the decoction, analyzed it himself, but found nothing. It so chanced that Remonencq had taken fright and omitted to dip the disc in the tumbler that day. Then Dr.Poulain fell back on himself and science and got out of the difficulty with a theory. A sedentary life in a damp room; a cramped position before the barred window—these conditions had vitiated the blood in the absence of proper exercise, especially as the patient continually breathed an atmosphere saturated with the fetid exhalations of the gutter. The Rue de Normandie is one of the old-fashioned streets that slope towards the middle; the municipal authorities of Paris as yet have laid on no water supply to flush the central kennel which drains the houses on either side, and as a result a stream of filthy ooze meanders among the cobblestones, filters into the soil, and produces the mud peculiar to the city.

La Cibot came and went; but her husband, a hard-working man, sat day in day out like a fakir on the table in the window, till his knee-joints were stiffened, the blood stagnated in his body, and his legs grew so thin and crooked that he almost lost the use of them. The deep copper tint of the man's complexion naturally suggested that he had been out of health for a very long time. The wife's good health and the husband's illness seemed to the doctor to be satisfactorily accounted for by this theory.

"Then what is the matter with my poor Cibot?" asked the portress.

"My dear Mme. Cibot, he is dying of the porter's disease," said the doctor. "Incurable vitiation of the blood is evident from the general anaemic condition."

No one had anything to gain by a crime so objectless. Dr. Poulain's first suspicions were effaced by this thought. Who could have any possible interest in Cibot's death? His wife?—the doctor saw her taste the herb-tea as she sweetened it. Crimes which escape social vengeance are many enough, and as a rule they are of this order—to wit, murders committed without any startling sign of violence, without bloodshed, bruises, marks of strangling, without any bungling of the business, in short; if there seems to be no motive for the crime, it most likely goes unpunished, especially if the death occurs among the poorer classes. Murder is almost always denounced by its advanced guards, by hatred or greed well known to those under whose eyes the whole matter has passed. But in the case of the Cibots, no one save the doctor had any interest in discovering the actual cause of death. The little copper-faced tailor's wife adored her husband; he had no money and no enemies; La Cibot's fortune and the marine-store dealer's motives were alike hidden in the shade. Poulain knew the portress and her way of thinking perfectly well; he thought her capable of tormenting Pons, but he saw that she had neither motive enough nor wit enough for murder; and besides—every time the doctor came and she gave her husband a draught, she took a spoonful herself. Poulain himself, the only person who might have thrown light on the matter, inclined to believe that this was one of the unaccountable freaks of disease, one of the astonishing exceptions which make medicine so perilous a profession. And in truth, the little tailor's unwholesome life and unsanitary surroundings had unfortunately brought him to such a pass that the trace of copper-poisoning was like the last straw. Gossips and neighbors took it upon themselves to explain the sudden death, and no suspicion of blame lighted upon Remonencq.

"Oh! this long time past I have said that M. Cibot was not well," cried one.

"He worked too hard, he did," said another; "he heated his blood."

"He would not listen to me," put in a neighbor; "I advised him to walk out of a Sunday and keep Saint Monday; two days in the week is not too much for amusement."

In short, the gossip of the quarter, the tell-tale voice to which Justice, in the person of the commissary of police, the king of the poorer classes, lends an attentive ear—gossip explained the little tailor's demise in a perfectly satisfactory manner. Yet M. Poulain's pensive air and uneasy eyes embarrassed Remonencq not a little, and at sight of the doctor he offered eagerly to go in search of M. Trognon, Fraisier's acquaintance.

Fraisier turned to La Cibot to say in a low voice, "I shall come back again as soon as the will is made. In spite of your sorrow, you must look for squalls." Then he slipped away like a shadow and met his friend the doctor.

"Ah, Poulain!" he exclaimed, "it is all right. We are safe! I will tell you about it to-night. Look out a post that will suit you, you shall have it! For my own part, I am a justice of the peace. Tabareau will not refuse me now for a son-in-law. And as for you, I will undertake that you shall marry Mlle. Vitel, granddaughter of our justice of the peace."

Fraisier left Poulain reduced to dumb bewilderment by these wild words; bounced like a ball into the boulevard, hailed an omnibus, and was set down ten minutes later by the modern coach at the corner of the Rue de Choiseul. By this time it was nearly four o'clock. Fraisier felt quite sure of a word in private with the Presidente, for officials seldom leave the Palais de Justice before five o'clock.

Mme. de Marville's reception of him assured Fraisier that M. Leboeuf had kept his promise made to Mme. Vatinelle and spoken favorably of the sometime attorney at Mantes. Amelie's manner was almost caressing. So might the Duchesse de Montpensier have treated Jacques Clement. The petty attorney was a knife to her hand. But when Fraisier produced the joint-letter signed by Elie Magus and Remonencq offering the sum of nine hundred thousand francs in cash for Pons' collection, then the Presidente looked at her man of business and the gleam of the money flashed from her eyes. That ripple of greed reached the attorney.

"M. le President left a message with me," she said; "he hopes that you will dine with us to-morrow. It will be a family party. M. Godeschal, Desroches' successor and my attorney, will come to meet you, and Berthier, our notary, and my daughter and son-in-law. After dinner, you and I and the notary and attorney will have the little consultation for which you ask, and I will give you full powers. The two gentlemen will do as you require and act upon your inspiration; and see that everything goes well. You shall have a power of attorney from M. de Marville as soon as you want it."

"I shall want it on the day of the decease."

"It shall be in readiness."

"Mme. la Presidente, if I ask for a power of attorney, and would prefer that your attorney's name should not appear I wish it less in my own interest than in yours.... When I give myself, it is without reserve. And in return, madame, I ask the same fidelity; I ask my patrons (I do not venture to call you my clients) to put the same confidence in me. You may think that in acting thus I am trying to fasten upon this affair—no, no, madame; there may be reprehensible things done; with an inheritance in view one is dragged on... especially with nine hundred thousand francs in the balance. Well, now, you could not disavow a man like Maitre Godeschal, honesty itself, but you can throw all the blame on the back of a miserable pettifogging lawyer—"

Mme. Camusot de Marville looked admiringly at Fraisier.

"You ought to go very high," said she, "or sink very low. In your place, instead of asking to hide myself away as a justice of the peace, I would aim at the crown attorney's appointment—at, say, Mantes!—and make a great career for myself."

"Let me have my way, madame. The post of justice of the peace is an ambling pad for M. Vitel; for me it shall be a war-horse."

And in this way the Presidente proceeded to a final confidence. "You seem to be so completely devoted to our interests," she began, "that I will tell you about the difficulties of our position and our hopes. The President's great desire, ever since a match was projected between his daughter and an adventurer who recently started a bank,—the President's wish, I say, has been to round out the Marville estate with some grazing land, at that time in the market. We dispossessed ourselves of fine property, as you know, to settle it upon our daughter; but I wish very much, my daughter being an only child, to buy all that remains of the grass land. Part has been sold already. The estate belongs to an Englishman who is returning to England after a twenty years' residence in France. He built the most charming cottage in a delightful situation, between Marville Park and the meadows which once were part of the Marville lands; he bought up covers, copse, and gardens at fancy prices to make the grounds about the cottage. The house and its surroundings make a feature of the landscape, and it lies close to my daughter's park palings. The whole, land and house, should be bought for seven hundred thousand francs, for the net revenue is about twenty thousand francs.... But if Mr. Wadman finds out that we think of buying it, he is sure to add another two or three hundred thousand francs to the price; for he will lose money if the house counts for nothing, as it usually does when you buy land in the country—"

"Why, madame," Fraisier broke in, "in my opinion you can be so sure that the inheritance is yours that I will offer to act the part of purchaser for you. I will undertake that you shall have the land at the best possible price, and have a written engagement made out under private seal, like a contract to deliver goods.... I will go to the Englishman in the character of buyer. I understand that sort of thing; it was my specialty at Mantes. Vatinelle doubled the value of his practice, while I worked in his name."

"Hence your connection with little Madame Vatinelle. He must be very well off—"

"But Mme. Vatinelle has expensive tastes.... So be easy, madame—I will serve you up the Englishman done to a turn—"

"If you can manage that you will have eternal claims to my gratitude. Good-day, my dear M. Fraisier. Till to-morrow—"

Fraisier went. His parting bow was a degree less cringing than on the first occasion.

"I am to dine to-morrow with President de Marville!" he said to himself. "Come now, I have these folk in my power. Only, to be absolute master, I ought to be the German's legal adviser in the person of Tabareau, the justice's clerk. Tabareau will not have me now for his daughter, his only daughter, but he will give her to me when I am a justice of the peace. I shall be eligible. Mlle. Tabareau, that tall, consumptive girl with the red hair, has a house in the Place Royale in right of her mother. At her father's death she is sure to come in for six thousand francs, you must not look too hard at the plank."

As he went back to the Rue de Normandie by way of the boulevards, he dreamed out his golden dream, he gave himself up to the happiness of the thought that he should never know want again. He would marry his friend Poulain to Mlle. Vitel, the daughter of the justice of the peace; together, he and his friend the doctor would reign like kings in the quarter; he would carry all the elections—municipal, military, or political. The boulevards seem short if, while you pace afoot, you mount your ambition on the steed of fancy in this way.





LIX


Schmucke meanwhile went back to his friend Pons with the news that Cibot was dying, and Remonencq gone in search of M. Trognon, the notary. Pons was struck by the name. It had come up again and again in La Cibot's interminable talk, and La Cibot always recommended him as honesty incarnate. And with that a luminous idea occurred to Pons, in whom mistrust had grown paramount since the morning, an idea which completed his plan for outwitting La Cibot and unmasking her completely for the too-credulous Schmucke.

So many unexpected things had happened that day that poor Schmucke was quite bewildered. Pons took his friend's hand. "There must be a good deal of confusion in the house, Schmucke; if the porter is at death's door, we are almost free for a minute or two; that is to say, there will be no spies—for we are watched, you may be sure of that. Go out, take a cab, go to the theatre, and tell Mlle. Heloise Brisetout that I should like to see her before I die. Ask her to come here to-night when she leaves the theatre. Then go to your friends Brunner and Schwab and beg them to come to-morrow morning at nine o'clock to inquire after me; let them come up as if they were just passing by and called in to see me."

The old artist felt that he was dying, and this was the scheme that he forged. He meant Schmucke to be his universal legatee. To protect Schmucke from any possible legal quibbles, he proposed to dictate his will to a notary in the presence of witnesses, lest his sanity should be called in question and the Camusots should attempt upon that pretext to dispute the will. At the name of Trognon he caught a glimpse of machinations of some kind; perhaps a flaw purposely inserted, or premeditated treachery on La Cibot's part. He would prevent this. Trognon should dictate a holograph will which should be signed and deposited in a sealed envelope in a drawer. Then Schmucke, hidden in one of the cabinets in his alcove,should see La Cibot search for the will, find it, open the envelope, read it through, and seal it again. Next morning, at nine o'clock, he would cancel the will and make a new one in the presence of two notaries, everything in due form and order. La Cibot had treated him as a madman and a visionary; he saw what this meant—he saw the Presidente's hate and greed, her revenge in La Cibot's behavior. In the sleepless hours and lonely days of the last two months, the poor man had sifted the events of his past life.

It has been the wont of sculptors, ancient and modern, to set a tutelary genius with a lighted torch upon either side of a tomb. Those torches that light up the paths of death throw light for dying eyes upon the spectacle of a life's mistakes and sins; the carved stone figures express great ideas, they are symbols of a fact in human experience. The agony of death has its own wisdom. Not seldom a simple girl, scarcely more than a child, will grow wise with the experience of a hundred years, will gain prophetic vision, judge her family, and see clearly through all pretences, at the near approach of Death. Herein lies Death's poetry. But, strange and worthy of remark it is, there are two manners of death. The poetry of prophecy, the gift of seeing clearly into the future or the past, only belongs to those whose bodies are stricken, to those who die by the destruction of the organs of physical life. Consumptive patients, for instance, or those who die of gangrene like Louis XIV, of fever like Pons, of a stomach complaint like Mme. de Mortsauf, or of wounds received in the full tide of life like soldiers on the battlefield—all these may possess this supreme lucidity to the full; their deaths fill us with surprise and wonder. But many, on the other hand, die of intelligential diseases, as they may be called; of maladies seated in the brain or in that nervous system which acts as a kind of purveyor of thought fuel—and these die wholly, body and spirit are darkened together. The former are spirits deserted by the body, realizing for us our ideas of the spirits of Scripture; the latter are bodies untenanted by a spirit. Too late the virgin nature, the epicure-Cato, the righteous man almost without sin, was discovering the Presidente's real character—the sac of gall that did duty for her heart. He knew the world now that he was about to leave it, and for the past few hours he had risen gaily to his part, like a joyous artist finding a pretext for caricature and laughter in everything. The last links that bound him to life, the chains of admiration, the strong ties that bind the art lover to Art's masterpieces, had been snapped that morning. When Pons knew that La Cibot had robbed him, he bade farewell, like a Christian, to the pomps and vanities of Art, to his collection, to all his old friendships with the makers of so many fair things. Our forefathers counted the day of death as a Christian festival, and in something of the same spirit Pons' thoughts turned to the coming end. In his tender love he tried to protect Schmucke when he should be low in the grave. It was this father's thought that led him to fix his choice upon the leading lady of the ballet. Mlle. Brisetout should help him to baffle surrounding treachery, and those who in all probability would never forgive his innocent universal legatee.

Heloise Brisetout was one of the few natures that remain true in a false position. She was an opera-girl of the school of Josepha and Jenny Cadine, capable of playing any trick on a paying adorer; yet she was a good comrade, dreading no power on earth, accustomed as she was to see the weak side of the strong and to hold her own with the police at the scarcely idyllic Bal de Mabille and the carnival.

"If she asked for my place for Garangeot, she will think that she owes me a good turn by so much the more," said Pons to himself.

Thanks to the prevailing confusion in the porter's lodge, Schmucke succeeded in getting out of the house. He returned with the utmost speed, fearing to leave Pons too long alone.

M. Trognon reached the house just as Schmucke came in. Albeit Cibot was dying, his wife came upstairs with the notary, brought him into the bedroom, and withdrew, leaving Schmucke and Pons with M. Trognon; but she left the door ajar, and went no further than the next room. Providing herself with a little hand-glass of curious workmanship, she took up her station in the doorway, so that she could not only hear but see all that passed at the supreme moment.

"Sir," said Pons, "I am in the full possession of my faculties, unfortunately for me, for I feel that I am about to die; and doubtless, by the will of God, I shall be spared nothing of the agony of death. This is M.Schmucke—"

The notary bowed to M. Schmucke.

"My one friend on earth," continued Pons. "I wish to make him my universal legatee. Now, tell me how to word the will, so that my friend, who is a German and knows nothing of French law, may succeed to my possessions without any dispute."

"Anything is liable to be disputed, sir," said the notary; "that is the drawback of human justice. But in the matter of wills, there are wills so drafted that they cannot be upset—"

"In what way?" queried Pons.

"If a will is made in the presence of a notary, and before witnesses who can swear that the testator was in the full possession of his faculties; and if the testator has neither wife nor children, nor father nor mother—"

"I have none of these; all my affection is centred upon my dear friend Schmucke here."

The tears overflowed Schmucke's eyes.

"Then, if you have none but distant relatives, the law leaves you free to dispose of both personalty and real estate as you please, so long as you bequeath them for no unlawful purpose; for you must have come across cases of wills disputed on account of the testator's eccentricities. A will made in the presence of a notary is considered to be authentic; for the person's identity is established, the notary certifies that the testator was sane at the time, and there can be no possible dispute over the signature.—Still, a holograph will, properly and clearly worded, is quite as safe."

"I have decided, for reasons of my own, to make a holograph will at your dictation, and to deposit it with my friend here. Is this possible?"

"Quite possible," said the notary. "Will you write? I will begin to dictate—"

"Schmucke, bring me my little Boule writing-desk.—Speak low, sir," he added; "we may be overheard."

"Just tell me, first of all, what you intend," demanded the notary.

Ten minutes later La Cibot saw the notary look over the will, while Schmucke lighted a taper (Pons watching her reflection all the while in a mirror). She saw the envelope sealed, saw Pons give it to Schmucke,and heard him say that it must be put away in a secret drawer in his bureau. Then the testator asked for the key, tied it to the corner of his handkerchief, and slipped it under his pillow. The notary himself, by courtesy, was appointed executor. To him Pons left a picture of price, such a thing as the law permits a notary to receive. Trognon went out and came upon Mme. Cibot in the salon.

"Well, sir, did M. Pons remember me?"

"You do not expect a notary to betray secrets confided to him, my dear," returned M. Trognon. "I can only tell you this—there will be many disappointments, and some that are anxious after the money will be foiled. M. Pons has made a good and very sensible will, a patriotic will, which I highly approve."

La Cibot's curiosity, kindled by such words, reached an unimaginable pitch. She went downstairs and spent the night at Cibot's bedside, inwardly resolving that Mlle. Remonencq should take her place towards two or three in the morning, when she would go up and have a look at the document.





LX


Mlle. Brisetout's visit towards half-past ten that night seemed natural enough to La Cibot; but in her terror lest the ballet-girl should mention Gaudissart's gift of a thousand francs, she went upstairs with her, lavishing polite speeches and flattery as if Mlle. Heloise had been a queen.

"Ah! my dear, you are much nicer here on your own ground than at the theatre," Heloise remarked. "I advise you to keep to your employment."

Heloise was splendidly dressed. Bixiou, her lover, had brought her in his carriage on the way to an evening party at Mariette's. It so fell out that the first-floor lodger, M. Chapoulot, a retired braid manufacturer from the Rue Saint-Denis, returning from the Ambigu-Comique with his wife and daughter, was dazzled by a vision of such a costume and such a charming woman upon their staircase.

"Who is that, Mme. Cibot?" asked Mme. Chapoulot.

"A no-better-than-she-should-be, a light-skirts that you may see half-naked any evening for a couple of francs," La Cibot answered in an undertone for Mme. Chapoulot's ear.

"Victorine!" called the braid manufacturer's wife, "let the lady pass, child."

The matron's alarm signal was not lost upon Heloise. "Your daughter must be more inflammable than tinder, madame, if you are afraid that she will catch fire by touching me," she said.

M. Chapoulot waited on the landing. "She is uncommonly handsome off the stage," he remarked. Whereupon Mme. Chapoulot pinched him sharply and drove him indoors.

"Here is a second-floor lodger that has a mind to set up for being on the fourth floor," said Heloise as she continued to climb.

"But mademoiselle is accustomed to going higher and higher."

"Well, old boy," said Heloise, entering the bedroom and catching sight of the old musician's white, wasted face.

"Well, old boy, so we are not very well? Everybody at the theatre is asking after you; but though one's heart may be in the right place, every one has his own affairs, you know, and cannot find time to go to see friends. Gaudissart talks of coming round every day, and every morning the tiresome management gets hold of him. Still, we are all of us fond of you—"

"Mme. Cibot," said the patient, "be so kind as to leave us; we want to talk about the theatre and my post as conductor, with this lady. Schmucke, will you go to the door with Mme. Cibot?"

At a sign from Pons, Schmucke saw Mme. Cibot out at the door, and drew the bolts.

"Ah, that blackguard of a German! Is he spoiled, too?" La Cibot said to herself as she heard the significant sounds. "That is M. Pons' doing; he taught him those disgusting tricks.... But you shall pay for this, my dears," she thought as she went down stairs. "Pooh! if that tight-rope dancer tells him about the thousand francs, I shall say that it is a farce."

She seated herself by Cibot's pillow. Cibot complained of a burning sensation in the stomach. Remonencq had called in and given him a draught while his wife was upstairs.

As soon as Schmucke had dismissed La Cibot, Pons turned to the ballet-girl. "Dear child, I can trust no one else to find me a notary, an honest man, and send him here to make my will to-morrow morning at half-past nine precisely. I want to leave all that I have to Schmucke. If he is persecuted, poor German that he is, I shall reckon upon the notary; the notary must defend him. And for that reason I must have a wealthy notary, highly thought of, a man above the temptations to which pettifogging lawyers yield. He must succor my poor friend. I cannot trust Berthier, Cardot's successor. And you know so many people—"

"Oh! I have the very man for you," Heloise broke in; "there is the notary that acts for Florine and the Comtesse du Bruel, Leopold Hannequin, a virtuous man that does not know what a lorette is! He is a sort of chance-come father—a good soul that will not let you play ducks and drakes with your earnings; I call him Le Pere aux Rats, because he instils economical notions into the minds of all my friends. In the first place, my dear fellow,he has a private income of sixty thousand francs; and he is a notary of the real old sort, a notary while he walks or sleeps; his children must be little notaries and notaresses. He is a heavy, pedantic creature, and that's the truth; but on his own ground, he is not the man to flinch before any power in creation.... No woman ever got money out of him; he is a fossil pater-familias, his wife worships him, and does not deceive him, although she is a notary's wife.—What more do you want? as a notary he has not his match in Paris. He is in the patriarchal style; not queer and amusing, as Cardot used to be with Malaga; but he will never decamp like little What's-his-name that lived with Antonia. So I will send round my man to-morrow morning at eight o'clock.... You may sleep in peace. And I hope, in the first place, that you will get better, and make charming music for us again; and yet, after all, you see, life is very dreary—managers chisel you, and kings mizzle and ministers fizzle and rich fold economizzle.—Artists have nothing left here" (tapping her breast)—"it is a time to die in. Good-bye, old boy."

"Heloise, of all things, I ask you to keep my counsel."

"It is not a theatre affair," she said; "it is sacred for an artist."

"Who is your gentleman, child?"

"M. Baudoyer, the mayor of your arrondissement, a man as stupid as the late Crevel; Crevel once financed Gaudissart, you know, and a few days ago he died and left me nothing, not so much as a pot of pomatum. That made me say just now that this age of ours is something sickening."

"What did he die of?"

"Of his wife. If he had stayed with me, he would be living now. Good-bye, dear old boy, I am talking of going off, because I can see that you will be walking about the boulevards in a week or two, hunting up pretty little curiosities again. You are not ill; I never saw your eyes look so bright."

And she went, fully convinced that her protege Garangeot would conduct the orchestra for good.

Every door stood ajar as she went downstairs. Every lodger, on tip-toe, watched the lady of the ballet pass on her way out.

It was quite an event in the house. Fraisier, like the bulldog that sets his teeth and never lets go, was on the spot. He stood beside La Cibot when Mlle. Brisetout passed under the gateway and asked for the door to be opened. Knowing that a will had been made, he had come to see how the land lay, for Maitre Trognon, notary, had refused to say a syllable—Fraisier's questions were as fruitless as Mme. Cibot's. Naturally the ballet-girl's visit in extremis was not lost upon Fraisier; he vowed to himself that he would turn it to good account.

"My dear Mme. Cibot," he began, "now is the critical moment for you."

"Ah, yes... my poor Cibot!" said she. "When I think that he will not live to enjoy anything I may get—"

"It is a question of finding out whether M. Pons has left you anything at all; whether your name is mentioned or left out, in fact," he interrupted. "I represent the next-of-kin, and to them you must look in any case. It is a holograph will, and consequently very easy to upset.—Do you know where our man has put it?"

"In a secret drawer in his bureau, and he has the key of it. He tied it to a corner of his handkerchief, and put it under his pillow. I saw it all."

"Is the will sealed?"

"Yes, alas!"

"It is a criminal offence if you carry off a will and suppress it, but it is only a misdemeanor to look at it; and anyhow, what does it amount to? A peccadillo, and nobody will see you. Is your man a heavy sleeper?"

"Yes. But when you tried to see all the things and value them, he ought to have slept like a top, and yet he woke up. Still, I will see about it. I will take M. Schmucke's place about four o'clock this morning; and if you care to come, you shall have the will in your hands for ten minutes."

"Good. I will come up about four o'clock, and I will knock very softly—"

"Mlle Remonencq will take my place with Cibot. She will know, and open the door; but tap on the window, so as to rouse nobody in the house."

"Right," said Fraisier. "You will have a light, will you not. A candle will do."

At midnight poor Schmucke sat in his easy-chair, watching with a breaking heart that shrinking of the features that comes with death; Pons looked so worn out with the day's exertions, that death seemed very near.

Presently Pons spoke. "I have just enough strength, I think, to last till to-morrow night," he said philosophically. "To-morrow night the death agony will begin; poor Schmucke! As soon as the notary and your two friends are gone, go for our good Abbe Duplanty, the curate of Saint-Francois. Good man, he does not know that I am ill, and I wish to take the holy sacrament to-morrow at noon."

There was a long pause. "God so willed it that life has not been as I dreamed," Pons resumed. "I should so have loved wife and children and home.... To be loved by a very few in some corner—that was my whole ambition! Life is hard for every one; I have seen people who had all that I wanted so much and could not have, and yet they were not happy.... Then at the end of my life, God put untold comfort in my way, when He gave me such a friend.... And one thing I have not to reproach myself with—that I have not known your worth nor appreciated you, my good Schmucke.... I have loved you with my whole heart, with all the strength of love that is in me.... Do not cry, Schmucke; I shall say no more if you cry and it is so sweet to me to talk of ourselves to you.... If I had listened to you, I should not be dying. I should have left the world and broken off my habits, and then I should not have been wounded to death. And now, I want to think of no one but you at the last—"

"You are missdaken—"

"Do not contradict me—listen, dear friend.... You are as guileless and simple as a six-year-old child that has never left its mother; one honors you for it—it seems to me that God Himself must watch over such as you. But men are so wicked, that I ought to warn you beforehand... and then you will lose your generous trust, your saint-like belief in others, the bloom of a purity of soul that only belongs to genius or to hearts like yours.... In a little while you will see Mme. Cibot, who left the door ajar and watched us closely while M. Trognon was here—in a little while you will see her come for the will, as she believes it to be.... I expect the worthless creature will do her business this morning when she thinks you are asleep. Now, mind what I say, and carry out my instructions to the letter.... Are you listening?" asked the dying man.





LXI


But Schmucke was overcome with grief, his heart was throbbing painfully, his head fell back on the chair, he seemed to have lost con-sciousness.

"Yes," he answered, "I can hear, but it is as if you vere doo huntert baces afay from me.... It seem to me dat I am going town into der grafe mit you," said Schmucke, crushed with pain.

He went over to the bed, took one of Pons' hands in both his own, and within himself put up a fervent prayer.

"What is that that you are mumbling in German?"

"I asked Gott dat He vould take us poth togedders to Himself!" Schmucke answered simply when he had finished his prayer.

Pons bent over—it was a great effort, for he was suffering intolerable pain; but he managed to reach Schmucke, and kissed him on the forehead, pouring out his soul, as it were, in benediction upon a nature that recalled the lamb that lies at the foot of the Throne of God.

"See here, listen, my good Schmucke, you must do as dying people tell you—"

"I am lisdening."

"The little door in the recess in your bedroom opens into that closet."

"Yes, but it is blocked up mit bictures."

"Clear them away at once, without making too much noise."

"Yes."

"Clear a passage on both sides, so that you can pass from your room into mine.—Now, leave the door ajar.—When La Cibot comes to take your place (and she is capable of coming an hour earlier than usual), you can go away to bed as if nothing had happened, and look very tired. Try to look sleepy. As soon as she settles down into the armchair, go into the closet, draw aside the muslin curtains over the glass door, and watch her....Do you understand?"

"I oondershtand; you belief dat die pad voman is going to purn der vill."

"I do not know what she will do; but I am sure of this—that you will not take her for an angel afterwards.—And now play for me; improvise and make me happy. It will divert your thoughts; your gloomy ideas will vanish, and for me the dark hours will be filled with your dreams...."

Schmucke sat down at the piano. Here he was in his element; and in a few moments, musical inspiration, quickened by the pain with which he was quivering and the consequent irritation that followed came upon the kindly German, and, after his wont, he was caught up and borne above the world. On one sublime theme after another he executed variations, putting into them sometimes Chopin's sorrow, Chopin's Raphael-like perfection; sometimes the stormy Dante's grandeur of Liszt—the two musicians who most nearly approach Paganini's temperament. When execution reaches this supreme degree, the executant stands beside the poet, as it were; he is to the composer as the actor is to the writer of plays, a divinely inspired interpreter of things divine. But that night, when Schmucke gave Pons an earnest of diviner symphonies, of that heavenly music for which Saint Cecile let fall her instruments, he was at once Beethoven and Paganini, creator and interpreter. It was an outpouring of music inexhaustible as the nightingale's song—varied and full of delicate undergrowth as the forest flooded with her trills; sublime as the sky overhead. Schmucke played as he had never played before, and the soul of the old musician listening to him rose to ecstasy such as Raphael once painted in a picture which you may see at Bologna. A terrific ringing of the door-bell put an end to these visions. The first-floor lodgers sent up a servant with a message. Would Schmucke please stop the racket overhead. Madame, Monsieur, and Mademoiselle Chapoulot had been wakened, and could not sleep for the noise; they called his attention to the fact that the day was quite long enough for rehearsals of theatrical music, and added that people ought not to "strum" all night in a house in the Marais.—It was then three o'clock in the morning. At half-past three, La Cibot appeared, just as Pons had predicted. He might have actually heard the conference between Fraisier and the portress: "Did I not guess exactly how it would be?" his eyes seemed to say as he glanced at Schmucke, and, turning a little, he seemed to be fast asleep.

Schmucke's guileless simplicity was an article of belief with La Cibot (and be it noted that this faith in simplicity is the great source and secret of the success of all infantine strategy); La Cibot, therefore, could not suspect Schmucke of deceit when he came to say to her, with a face half of distress, half of glad relief:

"I haf had a derrible night! a derrible dime of it! I vas opliged to play to keep him kviet, and the virst-floor lodgers vas komm up to tell me to be kviet!... It was frightful, for der life of mein friend vas at shtake. I am so tired mit der blaying all night, dat dis morning I am all knocked up."

"My poor Cibot is very bad, too; one more day like yesterday, and he will have no strength left.... One can't help it; it is God's will."

"You haf a heart so honest, a soul so peautiful, dot gif der Zipod die, ve shall lif togedder," said the cunning Schmucke.

The craft of simple, straightforward folk is formidable indeed; they are exactly like children, setting their unsuspected snares with the perfect craft of the savage.

"Oh, well go and sleep, sonny!" returned La Cibot. "Your eyes look tired, they are as big as my fist. But there! if anything could comfort me for losing Cibot, it would be the thought of ending my days with a good man like you. Be easy. I will give Mme. Chapoulot a dressing down.... To think of a retired haberdasher's wife giving herself such airs!"

Schmucke went to his room and took up his post in the closet.

La Cibot had left the door ajar on the landing; Fraisier came in and closed it noiselessly as soon as he heard Schmucke shut his bedroom door. He had brought with him a lighted taper and a bit of very fine wire to open the seal of the will. La Cibot, meanwhile, looking under the pillow, found the handkerchief with the key of the bureau knotted to one corner; and this so much the more easily because Pons purposely left the end hanging over the bolster, and lay with his face to the wall. La Cibot went straight to the bureau, opened it cautiously so as to make as little noise as possible, found the spring of the secret drawer, and hurried into the salon with the will in her hand. Her flight roused Pons' curiosity to the highest pitch; and as for Schmucke, he trembled as if he were the guilty person.

"Go back," said Fraisier, when she handed over the will. "He may wake, and he must find you there."

Fraisier opened the seal with a dexterity which proved that his was no 'prentice hand, and read the following curious document, headed "My Will," with ever-deepening astonishment:

15th April, 1845

I, being in my sound mind (as this my Will, drawn up in concert with M. Trognon, will testify), and feeling that I must shortly die of the malady from which I have suffered since the beginning of February last, am anxious to dispose of my property, and have herein recorded my last wishes:—

I have always been impressed by the untoward cir-cumstances that injure great pictures, and not unfrequently bring about total destruction. I have felt sorry for the beautiful paintings condemned to travel from land to land, never finding some fixed abode whither admirers of great masterpieces may travel to see them. And I have always thought that the truly deathless work of a great master ought to be national property; put where every one of every nation may see it, even as the light, God's masterpiece, shines for all His children.

And as I have spent my life in collecting together and choosing a few pictures, some of the greatest masters' most glorious work, and as these pictures are as the master left them—genuine examples, neither repainted nor retouched,—it has been a painful thought to me that the paintings which have been the joy of my life, may be sold by public auction, and go, some to England, some to Russia, till they are all scattered abroad again as if they had never been gathered together. From this wretched fate I have determined to save both them and the frames in which they are set, all of them the work of skilled craftsmen.

On these grounds, therefore, I give and bequeath the pictures which compose my collection to the King, for the gallery in the Louvre, subject to the charge (if the legacy is accepted) of a life-annuity of two thousand four hundred francs to my friend Wilhelm Schmucke.

If the King, as usufructuary of the Louvre collection, should refuse the legacy with the charge upon it, the said pictures shall form a part of the estate which I leave to my friend, Schmucke, on condition that he shall deliver the Monkey's Head, by Goya, to my cousin, President Camusot; a Flower-piece, the tulips, by Abraham Mignon, to M. Trognon, notary (whom I appoint as my executor): and allow Mme. Cibot, who has acted as my housekeeper for ten years, the sum of two hundred francs per annum.

Finally, my friend Schmucke is to give the Descent from the Cross, Ruben's sketch for his great picture at Antwerp, to adorn a chapel in the parish church, in grateful acknowledgment of M. Duplanty's kindness to me; for to him I owe it that I can die as a Christian and a Catholic. —So ran the will.

Pons

"This is ruin!" mused Fraisier, "the ruin of all my hopes. Ha! I begin to believe all that the Presidente told me about this old artist and his cunning."

"Well?" La Cibot came back to say.

"Your gentleman is a monster. He is leaving everything to the Crown. Now, you cannot plead against the Crown.... The will cannot be disputed.... We are robbed, ruined, spoiled, and murdered!"

"What has he left to me?"

"Two hundred francs a year."

"A pretty come-down!... Why, he is a finished scoundrel."

"Go and see," said Fraisier, "and I will put your scoundrel's will back again in the envelope."





LXII


While Mme. Cibot's back was turned, Fraisier nimbly slipped a sheet of blank paper into the envelope; the will he put in his pocket. He next proceeded to seal the envelope again so cleverly that he showed the seal to Mme. Cibot when she returned, and asked her if she could see the slightest trace of the operation. La Cibot took up the envelope, felt it over, assured herself that it was not empty, and heaved a deep sigh. She had entertained hopes that Fraisier himself would have burned the unlucky document while she was out of the room.

"Well, my dear M. Fraisier, what is to be done?"

"Oh! that is your affair! I am not one of the next-of-kin, myself; but if I had the slightest claim to any of that" (indicating the collection), "I know very well what I should do."

"That is just what I want to know," La Cibot answered, with sufficient simplicity.

"There is a fire in the grate——" he said. Then he rose to go.

"After all, no one will know about it, but you and me——" began La Cibot.

"It can never be proved that a will existed," asserted the man of law.

"And you?"

"I?... If M. Pons dies intestate, you shall have a hundred thousand francs."

"Oh yes, no doubt," returned she. "People promise you heaps of money, and when they come by their own, and there is talk of paying they swindle you like—"

"Like Elie Magus," she was going to say, but she stopped herself just in time.

"I am going," said Fraisier; "it is not to your interest that I should be found here; but I shall see you again downstairs."

La Cibot shut the door and returned with the sealed packet in her hand. She had quite made up her mind to burn it; but as she went towards the bedroom fireplace, she felt the grasp of a hand on each arm, and saw—Schmucke on one hand, and Pons himself on the other, leaning against the partition wall on either side of the door.

La Cibot cried out, and fell face downwards in a fit; real or feigned, no one ever knew the truth. This sight produced such an impression on Pons that a deadly faintness came upon him, and Schmucke left the woman on the floor to help Pons back to bed. The friends trembled in every limb; they had set themselves a hard task, it was done, but it had been too much for their strength. When Pons lay in bed again, and Schmucke had regained strength to some extent, he heard a sound of sobbing. La Cibot, on her knees, bursting into tears, held out supplicating hands to them in very expressive pantomime.

"It was pure curiosity!" she sobbed, when she saw that Pons and Schmucke were paying attention to her proceedings. "Pure curiosity; a woman's fault, you know. But I did not know how else to get a sight of your will, and I brought it back again—"

"Go!" said Schmucke, standing erect, his tall figure gaining in height by the full height of his indignation. "You are a monster! You dried to kill mein goot Bons! He is right. You are worse than a monster, you are a lost soul!"

La Cibot saw the look of abhorrence in the frank German's face; she rose, proud as Tartuffe, gave Schmucke a glance which made him quake, and went out, carrying off under her dress an exquisite little picture of Metzu's pointed out by Elie Magus. "A diamond," he had called it. Fraisier downstairs in the porter's lodge was waiting to hear that La Cibot had burned the envelope and the sheet of blank paper inside it. Great was his astonishment when he beheld his fair client's agitation and dismay.

"What has happened?"

"This has happened, my dear M. Fraisier. Under pretence of giving me good advice and telling me what to do, you have lost me my annuity and the gentlemen's confidence...."

One of the word-tornadoes in which she excelled was in full progress,but Fraisier cut her short.

"This is idle talk. The facts, the facts! and be quick about it."

"Well; it came about in this way,"—and she told him of the scene which she had just come through.

"You have lost nothing through me," was Fraisier's comment. "The gentlemen had their doubts, or they would not have set this trap for you. They were lying in wait and spying upon you.... You have not told me everything," he added, with a tiger's glance at the woman before him.

"I hide anything from you!" cried she—"after all that we have done together!" she added with a shudder.

"My dear madame, I have done nothing blameworthy," returned Fraisier. Evidently he meant to deny his nocturnal visit to Pons' rooms.

Every hair on La Cibot's head seemed to scorch her, while a sense of icy cold swept over her from head to foot.

"What?"... she faltered in bewilderment.

"Here is a criminal charge on the face of it.... You may be accused of suppressing the will," Fraisier made answer drily.

La Cibot started.

"Don't be alarmed; I am your legal adviser. I only wished to show you how easy it is, in one way or another, to do as I once explained to you. Let us see, now; what have you done that this simple German should be hiding in the room?"

"Nothing at all, unless it was that scene the other day when I stood M. Pons out that his eyes dazzled. And ever since, the two gentlemen have been as different as can be. So you have brought all my troubles upon me; I might have lost my influence with M. Pons, but I was sure of the German; just now he was talking of marrying me or of taking me with him—it is all one."

The excuse was so plausible that Fraisier was fain to be satisfied with it.

"You need fear nothing," he resumed. "I gave you my word that you shall have your money, and I shall keep my word. The whole matter, so far, was up in the air, but now it is as good as bank-notes.... You shall have at least twelve hundred francs per annum.... But, my good lady, you must act intelligently under my orders."

"Yes, my dear M. Fraisier," said La Cibot with cringing servility. She was completely subdued.

"Very good. Good-bye," and Fraisier went, taking the dangerous document with him.

He reached home in great spirits. The will was a terrible weapon.

"Now," thought he, "I have a hold on Mme. la Presidente de Marville; she must keep her word with me. If she did not, she would lose the property."





LXIII


At daybreak, when Remonencq had taken down his shutters and left his sister in charge of the shop, he came, after his wont of late, to inquire for his good friend Cibot. The portress was contemplating the Metzu, privately wondering how a little bit of painted wood could be worth such a lot of money.

"Aha!" said he, looking over her shoulder, "that is the one picture which M. Elie Magus regretted; with that little bit of a thing, he says, his happiness would be complete."

"What would he give for it?" asked La Cibot.

"Why, if you will promise to marry me within a year of widowhood, I will undertake to get twenty thousand francs for it from Elie Magus; and unless you marry me you will never get a thousand francs for the picture."

"Why not?"

"Because you would be obliged to give a receipt for the money, and then you might have a lawsuit with the heirs-at-law. If you were my wife, I myself should sell the thing to M. Magus, and in the way of business it is enough to make an entry in the day-book, and I should note that M. Schmucke sold it to me. There, leave the panel with me.... If your husband were to die you might have a lot of bother over it, but no one would think it odd that I should have a picture in the shop.... You know me quite well. Besides, I will give you a receipt if you like."

The covetous portress felt that she had been caught; she agreed to a proposal which was to bind her for the rest of her life to the marine-store dealer.

"You are right," said she, as she locked the picture away in a chest; "bring me the bit of writing."

Remonencq beckoned her to the door. "I can see, neighbor, that we shall not save our poor dear Cibot," he said lowering his voice. "Dr.Poulain gave him up yesterday evening, and said that he could not last out the day.... It is a great misfortune. But after all, this was not the place for you.... You ought to be in a fine curiosity shop on the Boulevard des Capucines. Do you know that I have made nearly a hundred thousand francs in ten years? And if you will have as much some day, I will undertake to make a handsome fortune for you—as my wife. You would be the mistress—my sister should wait on you and do the work of the house, and—"

A heartrending moan from the little tailor cut the tempter short; the death agony had begun.

"Go away," said La Cibot. "You are a monster to talk of such things and my poor man dying like this—"

"Ah! it is because I love you," said Remonencq; "I could let everything else go to have you—"

"If you loved me, you would say nothing to me just now," returned she.

And Remonencq departed to his shop, sure of marrying La Cibot.

Towards ten o'clock there was a sort of commotion in the street; M. Cibot was taking the Sacrament. All the friends of the pair, all the porters and porters' wives in the Rue de Normandie and neighboring streets, had crowded into the lodge, under the archway, and stood on the pavement outside. Nobody so much as noticed the arrival of M. Leopold Hannequin and a brother lawyer. Schwab and Brunner reached Pons' rooms unseen by Mme. Cibot. The notary, inquiring for Pons, was shown upstairs by the portress of a neighboring house. Brunner remembered his previous visit to the museum, and went straight in with his friend Schwab. Pons formally revoked his previous will and constituted Schmucke his universal legatee. This accomplished, he thanked Schwab and Brunner, and earnestly begged M. Leopold Hannequin to protect Schmucke's interests. The demands made upon him by last night's scene with La Cibot, and this final settlement of his worldly affairs, left him so faint and exhausted that Schmucke begged Schwab to go for the Abbe Duplanty; it was Pons' great desire to take the Sacrament, and Schmucke could not bring himself to leave his friend.

La Cibot, sitting at the foot of her husband's bed, gave not so much as a thought to Schmucke's breakfast—for that matter had been forbidden to return; but the morning's events, the sight of Pons' heroic resignation in the death agony, so oppressed Schmucke's heart that he was not conscious of hunger.

Towards two o'clock, however, as nothing had been seen of the old German, La Cibot sent Remonencq's sister to see whether Schmucke wanted anything; prompted not so much by interest as by curiosity. The Abbe Duplanty had just heard the old musician's dying confession, and the administration of the sacrament of extreme unction was disturbed by repeated ringing of the door-bell. Pons, in his terror of robbery, had made Schmucke promise solemnly to admit no one into the house; so Schmucke did not stir. Again and again Mlle. Remonencq pulled the cord, and finally went downstairs in alarm to tell La Cibot that Schmucke would not open the door; Fraisier made a note of this. Schmucke had never seen any one die in his life; before long he would be perplexed by the many difficulties which beset those who are left with a dead body in Paris, this more especially if they are lonely and helpless and have no one to act for them. Fraisier knew, moreover, that in real affliction people lose their heads, and therefore immediately after breakfast he took up his position in the porter's lodge, and sitting there in perpetual committee with Dr. Poulain, conceived the idea of directing all Schmucke's actions himself.

To obtain the important result, the doctor and the lawyer took their measures on this wise:—

The beadle of Saint-Francois, Cantinet by name, at one time a retail dealer in glassware, lived in the Rue d'Orleans, next door to Dr. Poulain and under the same roof. Mme. Cantinet, who saw to the letting of the chairs at Saint-Francois, once had fallen ill and Dr. Poulain had attended her gratuitously; she was, as might be expected, grateful, and often confided her troubles to him. The "nutcrackers," punctual in their attendance at Saint-Francois on Sundays and saints'-days, were on friendly terms with the beadle and the lowest ecclesiastical rank and file, commonly called in Paris le bas clerge, to whom the devout usually give little presents from time to time. Mme. Cantinet therefore knew Schmucke almost as well as Schmucke knew her. And Mme. Cantinet was afflicted with two sore troubles which enabled the lawyer to use her as a blind and involuntary agent. Cantinet junior, a stage-struck youth, had deserted the paths of the Church and turned his back on the prospect of one day becoming a beadle, to make his debut among the supernumeraries of the Cirque-Olympique; he was leading a wild life, breaking his mother's heart and draining her purse by frequent forced loans. Cantinet senior, much addicted to spirituous liquors and idleness, had, in fact, been driven to retire from business by those two failings. So far from reforming, the incorrigible offender had found scope in his new occupation for the indulgence of both cravings; he did nothing, and he drank with drivers of wedding-coaches, with the undertaker's men at funerals, with poor folk relieved by the vicar, till his morning's occupation was set forth in rubric on his countenance by noon.

Mme. Cantinet saw no prospect but want in her old age, and yet she had brought her husband twelve thousand francs, she said. The tale of her woes related for the hundredth time suggested an idea to Dr. Poulain. Once introduce her into the old bachelor's quarters, and it would be easy by her means to establish Mme. Sauvage there as working housekeeper. It was quite impossible to present Mme. Sauvage herself, for the "nutcrackers" had grown suspicious of every one. Schmucke's refusal to admit Mlle. Remonencq had sufficiently opened Fraisier's eyes. Still, it seemed evident that Pons and Schmucke, being pious souls, would take any one recommended by the Abbe, with blind confidence. Mme. Cantinet should bring Mme. Sauvage with her, and to put in Fraisier's servant was almost tantamount to installing Fraisier himself.





LXIV


The Abbe Duplanty, coming downstairs, found the gateway blocked by the Cibots' friends, all of them bent upon showing their interest in one of the oldest and most respectable porters in the Marais.

Dr. Poulain raised his hat, and took the Abbe aside.

"I am just about to go to poor M. Pons," he said. "There is still a chance of recovery; but it is a question of inducing him to undergo an operation. The calculi are perceptible to the touch, they are setting up an inflammatory condition which will end fatally, but perhaps it is not too late to remove them. You should really use your influence to persuade the patient to submit to surgical treatment; I will answer for his life, provided that no untoward circumstance occurs during the operation."

"I will return as soon as I have taken the sacred ciborium back to the church," said the Abbe Duplanty, "for M. Schmucke's condition claims the support of religion."

"I have just heard that he is alone," said Dr. Poulain. "The German, good soul, had a little altercation this morning with Mme. Cibot, who has acted as housekeeper to them both for the past ten years. They have quarreled (for the moment only, no doubt), but under the circumstances they must have some one in to help upstairs. It would be a charity to look after him.—I say, Cantinet," continued the doctor, beckoning to the beadle, "just go and ask your wife if she will nurse M. Pons, and look after M. Schmucke, and take Mme. Cibot's place for a day or two.... Even without the quarrel, Mme. Cibot would still require a substitute. Mme. Cantinet is honest," added the doctor, turning to M. Duplanty.

"You could not make a better choice," said the good priest; "she is intrusted with the letting of chairs in the church."

A few minutes later, Dr. Poulain stood by Pons' pillow watching the progress made by death, and Schmucke's vain efforts to persuade his friend to consent to the operation. To all the poor German's despairing entreaties Pons only replied by a shake of the head and occasional impatient movements; till, after awhile, he summoned up all his fast-failing strength to say, with a heartrending look:

"Do let me die in peace!"

Schmucke almost died of sorrow, but he took Pons' hand and softly kissed it, and held it between his own, as if trying a second time to give his own vitality to his friend. Just at this moment the bell rang, and Dr. Poulain, going to the door, admitted the Abbe Duplanty.

"Our poor patient is struggling in the grasp of death," he said. "All will be over in a few hours. You will send a priest, no doubt, to watch to-night. But it is time that Mme. Cantinet came, as well as a woman to do the work, for M. Schmucke is quite unfit to think of anything: I am afraid for his reason; and there are valuables here which ought to be in the custody of honest persons."

The Abbe Duplanty, a kindly, upright priest, guileless and unsuspicious, was struck with the truth of Dr. Poulain's remarks. He had, moreover, a certain belief in the doctor of the quarter. So on the threshold of the death-chamber he stopped and beckoned to Schmucke, but Schmucke could not bring himself to loosen the grasp of the hand that grew tighter and tighter. Pons seemed to think that he was slipping over the edge of a precipice and must catch at something to save himself. But, as many know, the dying are haunted by an hallucination that leads them to snatch at things about them, like men eager to save their most precious possessions from a fire. Presently Pons released Schmucke to clutch at the bed-clothes, dragging them and huddling them about himself with a hasty, covetous movement significant and painful to see.

"What will you do, left alone with your dead friend?" asked M. l'Abbe Duplanty when Schmucke came to the door. "You have not Mme. Cibot now—"

"Ein monster dat haf killed Bons!"

"But you must have somebody with you," began Dr. Poulain. "Some one must sit up with the body to-night."

"I shall sit up; I shall say die prayers to Gott," the innocent German answered.

"But you must eat—and who is to cook for you now?" asked the doctor.

"Grief haf taken afay mein abbetite," Schmucke said, simply.

"And some one must give notice to the registrar," said Poulain, "and lay out the body, and order the funeral; and the person who sits up with the body and the priest will want meals. Can you do all this by yourself? A man cannot die like a dog in the capital of the civilized world."

Schmucke opened wide eyes of dismay. A brief fit of madness seized him.

"But Bons shall not tie!..." he cried aloud. "I shall safe him!"

"You cannot go without sleep much longer, and who will take your place? Some one must look after M. Pons, and give him drink, and nurse him—"

"Ah! dat is drue."

"Very well," said the Abbe, "I am thinking of sending your Mme. Cantinet, a good and honest creature—"

The practical details of the care of the dead bewildered Schmucke, till he was fain to die with his friend.

"He is a child," said the doctor, turning to the Abbe Duplanty.

"Ein child," Schmucke repeated mechanically.

"There, then," said the curate; "I will speak to Mme. Cantinet, and send her to you."

"Do not trouble yourself," said the doctor; "I am going home, and she lives in the next house."

The dying seem to struggle with Death as with an invisible assassin; in the agony at the last, as the final thrust is made, the act of dying seems to be a conflict, a hand-to-hand fight for life. Pons had reached the supreme moment. At the sound of his groans and cries, the three standing in the doorway hurried to the bedside. Then came the last blow, smiting asunder the bonds between soul and body, striking down to life's sources; and suddenly Pons regained for a few brief moments the perfect calm that follows the struggle. He came to himself, and with the serenity of death in his face he looked round almost smilingly at them.

"Ah, doctor, I have had a hard time of it; but you were right, I am doing better. Thank you, my good Abbe; I was wondering what had become of Schmucke—"

"Schmucke has had nothing to eat since yesterday evening, and now it is four o'clock! You have no one with you now and it would be wise to send for Mme. Cibot."

"She is capable of anything!" said Pons, without attempting to conceal all his abhorrence at the sound of her name. "It is true, Schmucke ought to have some trustworthy person."

"M. Duplanty and I have been thinking about you both—"

"Ah! thank you, I had not thought of that."

"—And M. Duplanty suggests that you should have Mme. Cantinet—"

"Oh! Mme. Cantinet who lets the chairs!" exclaimed Pons. "Yes, she is an excellent creature."

"She has no liking for Mme. Cibot," continued the doctor, "and she would take good care of M. Schmucke—"

"Send her to me, M. Duplanty... send her and her husband too. I shall be easy. Nothing will be stolen here."

Schmucke had taken Pons' hand again, and held it joyously in his own. Pons was almost well again, he thought.

"Let us go, Monsieur l'Abbe," said the doctor. "I will send Mme. Cantinet round at once. I see how it is. She perhaps may not find M. Pons alive."





LXV


While the Abbe Duplanty was persuading Pons to engage Mme. Cantinet as his nurse, Fraisier had sent for her. He had plied the beadle's wife with sophistical reasoning and subtlety. It was difficult to resist his corrupting influence. And as for Mme. Cantinet—a lean, sallow woman, with large teeth and thin lips—her intelligence, as so often happens with women of the people, had been blunted by a hard life, till she had come to look upon the slenderest daily wage as prosperity. She soon consented to take Mme. Sauvage with her as general servant. Mme. Sauvage had had her instructions already. She had undertaken to weave a web of iron wire about the two musicians, and to watch them as a spider watches a fly caught in the toils; and her reward was to be a tobacconist's license. Fraisier had found a convenient opportunity of getting rid of his so-called foster-mother, while he posted her as a detective and policeman to supervise Mme. Cantinet. As there was a servant's bedroom and a little kitchen included in the apartment, La Sauvage could sleep on a truckle-bed and cook for the German. Dr. Poulain came with the two women just as Pons drew his last breath. Schmucke was sitting beside his friend, all unconscious of the crisis, holding the hand that slowly grew colder in his grasp. He signed to Mme. Cantinet to be silent; but Mme. Sauvage's soldierly figure surprised him so much that he started in spite of himself, a kind of homage to which the virago was quite accustomed.

"M. Duplanty answers for this lady," whispered Mme. Cantinet by way of introduction. "She once was cook to a bishop; she is honesty itself; she will do the cooking."

"Oh! you may talk out loud," wheezed the stalwart dame. "The poor gentleman is dead.... He has just gone."

A shrill cry broke from Schmucke. He felt Pons' cold hand stiffening in his, and sat staring into his friend's eyes; the look in them would have driven him mad, if Mme. Sauvage, doubtless accustomed to scenes of this sort, had not come to the bedside with a mirror which she held over the lips of the dead. When she saw that there was no mist upon the surface, she briskly snatched Schmucke's hand away.

"Just take away your hand, sir; you may not be able to do it in a little while. You do not know how the bones harden. A corpse grows cold very quickly. If you do not lay out a body while it is warm, you have to break the joints later on...."

And so it was this terrible woman who closed the poor dead musician's eyes. With a business-like dexterity acquired in ten years of experience, she stripped and straightened the body, laid the arms by the sides, and covered the face with the bedclothes, exactly as a shopman wraps a parcel.

"A sheet will be wanted to lay him out.—Where is there a sheet?" she demanded, turning on the terror-stricken Schmucke.

He had watched the religious ritual with its deep reverence for the creature made for such high destinies in heaven; and now he saw his dead friend treated simply as a thing in this packing process—saw with the sharp pain that dissolves the very elements of thought.

"Do as you vill——" he answered mechanically.

The innocent creature for the first time in his life had seen a man die, and that man was Pons, his only friend, the one human being who understood him and loved him.

"I will go and ask Mme. Cibot where the sheets are kept," said La Sauvage.

"A truckle-bed will be wanted for the person to sleep upon," Mme. Cantinet came to tell Schmucke.

Schmucke nodded and broke out into weeping. Mme. Cantinet left the unhappy man in peace; but an hour later she came back to say:

"Have you any money, sir, to pay for the things?"

The look that Schmucke gave Mme. Cantinet would have disarmed the fiercest hate; it was the white, blank, peaked face of death that he turned upon her, as an explanation that met everything.

"Dake it all and leaf me to mein prayers and tears," he said, and knelt.

Mme. Sauvage went to Fraisier with the news of Pons' death. Fraisier took a cab and went to the Presidente. To-morrow she must give him the power of attorney to enable him to act for the heirs.

Another hour went by, and Mme. Cantinet came again to Schmucke. "I have been to Mme. Cibot, sir, who knows all about things here," she said. "I asked her to tell me where everything is kept. But she almost jawed me to death with her abuse.... Sir, do listen to me...."

Schmucke looked up at the woman, and she went on, innocent of any barbarous intention, for women of her class are accustomed to take the worst of moral suffering passively, as a matter of course.

"We must have linen for the shroud, sir, we must have money to buy a truckle-bed for the person to sleep upon, and some things for the kitchen—plates, and dishes, and glasses, for a priest will be coming to pass the night here, and the person says that there is absolutely nothing in the kitchen."

"And what is more, sir, I must have coal and firing if I am to get the dinner ready," echoed La Sauvage, "and not a thing can I find. Not that there is anything so very surprising in that, as La Cibot used to do everything for you—"

Schmucke lay at the feet of the dead; he heard nothing, knew nothing, saw nothing. Mme. Cantinet pointed to him.

"My dear woman, you would not believe me," she said. "Whatever you say, he does not answer."

"Very well, child," said La Sauvage; "now I will show you what to do in a case of this kind."

She looked round the room as a thief looks in search of possible hiding-places for money; then she went straight to Pons' chest, opened the first drawer, saw the bag in which Schmucke had put the rest of the money after the sale of the pictures, and held it up before him. He nodded mechanically.

"Here is money, child," said La Sauvage, turning to Mme. Cantinet. "I will count it first and take enough to buy everything we want—wine, provisions, wax-candles, all sorts of things, in fact, for there is nothing in the house.... Just look in the drawers for a sheet to bury him in. I certainly was told that the poor gentleman was simple, but I don't know what he is; he is worse. He is like a new-born child; we shall have to feed him with a funnel."

The women went about their work, and Schmucke looked on precisely as an idiot might have done. Broken down with sorrow, wholly absorbed, in a half-cataleptic state, he could not take his eyes from the face that seemed to fascinate him, Pons' face refined by the absolute repose of Death. Schmucke hoped to die; everything was alike indifferent. If the room had been on fire he would not have stirred.

"There are twelve hundred and fifty francs here," La Sauvage told him.

Schmucke shrugged his shoulders. But when La Sauvage came near to measure the body by laying the sheet over it, before cutting out the shroud, a horrible struggle ensued between her and the poor German. Schmucke was furious. He behaved like a dog that watches by his dead master's body, and shows his teeth at all who try to touch it. La Sauvage grew impatient. She grasped him, set him in the armchair, and held him down with herculean strength.

"Go on, child; sew him in his shroud," she said, turning to Mme. Cantinet.

As soon as this operation was completed, La Sauvage set Schmucke back in his place at the foot of the bed. "Do you understand?" said she. "The poor dead man lying there must be done up, there is no help for it."

Schmucke began to cry. The women left him and took possession of the kitchen, whither they brought all the necessaries in a very short time.





LXVI


La Sauvage made out a preliminary statement accounting for three hundred and sixty francs, and then proceeded to prepare a dinner for four persons. And what a dinner! A fat goose (the cobbler's pheasant) by way of a substantial roast, an omelette with preserves, a salad, and the inevitable broth—the quantities of the ingredients for this last being so excessive that the soup was more like a strong meat-jelly. At nine o'clock the priest, sent by the curate to watch by the dead, came in with Cantinet, who brought four tall wax candles and some tapers. In the death-chamber Schmucke was lying with his arms about the body of his friend, holding him in a tight clasp; nothing but the authority of religion availed to separate him from his dead. Then the priest settled himself comfortably in the easy-chair and read his prayers while Schmucke, kneeling beside the couch, besought God to work a miracle and unite him to Pons, so that they might be buried in the same grave; and Mme. Cantinet went on her way to the Temple to buy a pallet and complete bedding for Mme. Sauvage. The twelve hundred and fifty francs were regarded as plunder. At eleven o'clock Mme. Cantinet came in to ask if Schmucke would not eat a morsel, but with a gesture he signified that he wished to be left in peace.

"Your supper is ready, M. Pastelot," she said, addressing the priest, and they went.

Schmucke, left alone in the room, smiled to himself like a madman free at last to gratify a desire like the longing of pregnancy. He flung himself down beside Pons, and yet again he held his friend in a long, close embrace. At midnight the priest came back and scolded him, and Schmucke returned to his prayers. At daybreak the priest went, and at seven o'clock in the morning the doctor came to see Schmucke, and spoke kindly and tried hard to persuade him to eat, but the German refused.

"If you do not eat now you will feel very hungry when you come back," the doctor told him, "for you must go to the mayor's office and take a witness with you, so that the registrar may issue a certificate of death."

"I must go!" cried Schmucke in frightened tones.

"Who else?... You must go, for you were the one person who saw him die."

"Mein legs vill nicht carry me," pleaded Schmucke, imploring the doctor to come to the rescue.

"Take a cab," the hypocritical doctor blandly suggested. "I have given notice already. Ask some one in the house to go with you. The two women will look after the place while you are away."

No one imagines how the requirements of the law jar upon a heartfelt sorrow. The thought of it is enough to make one turn from civilization and choose rather the customs of the savage. At nine o'clock that morning Mme. Sauvage half-carried Schmucke downstairs, and from the cab he was obliged to beg Remonencq to come with him to the registrar as a second witness. Here in Paris, in this land of ours besotted with Equality, the inequality of conditions is glaringly apparent everywhere and in everything. The immutable tendency of things peeps out even in the practical aspects of Death. In well-to-do families, a relative, a friend, or a man of business spares the mourners these painful details; but in this, as in the matter of taxation, the whole burden falls heaviest upon the shoulders of the poor.

"Ah! you have good reason to regret him," said Remonencq in answer to the poor martyr's moan; "he was a very good, a very honest man, and he has left a fine collection behind him. But being a foreigner, sir, do you know that you are like to find yourself in a great predicament—for everybody says that M. Pons left everything to you?"

Schmucke was not listening. He was sounding the dark depths of sorrow that border upon madness. There is such a thing as tetanus of the soul.

"And you would do well to find some one—some man of business—to advise you and act for you," pursued Remonencq.

"Ein mann of pizness!" echoed Schmucke.

"You will find that you will want some one to act for you. If I were you, I should take an experienced man, somebody well known to you in the quarter, a man you can trust.... I always go to Tabareau myself for my bits of affairs—he is the bailiff. If you give his clerk power to act for you, you need not trouble yourself any further."

Remonencq and La Cibot, prompted by Fraisier, had agreed beforehand to make a suggestion which stuck in Schmucke's memory; for there are times in our lives when grief, as it were, congeals the mind by arresting all its functions, and any chance impression made at such moments is retained by a frost-bound memory. Schmucke heard his companion with such a fixed, mindless stare, that Remonencq said no more.

"If he is always to be idiotic like this," thought Remonencq, "I might easily buy the whole bag of tricks up yonder for a hundred thousand francs; if it is really his.... Here we are at the mayor's office, sir."

Remonencq was obliged to take Schmucke out of the cab and to half-carry him to the registrar's department, where a wedding-party was assembled. Here they had to wait for their turn, for, by no very uncommon chance, the clerk had five or six certificates to make out that morning; and here it was appointed that poor Schmucke should suffer excruciating anguish.

"Monsieur is M. Schmucke?" remarked a person in a suit of black, reducing Schmucke to stupefaction by the mention of his name. He looked up with the same blank, unseeing eyes that he had turned upon Remonencq, who now interposed.

"What do you want with him?" he said. "Just leave him in peace; you can plainly see that he is in trouble."

"The gentleman has just lost his friend, and proposes, no doubt, to do honor to his memory, being, as he is, the sole heir. The gentleman, no doubt, will not haggle over it, he will buy a piece of ground outright for a grave. And as M. Pons was such a lover of the arts, it would be a great pity not to put Music, Painting, and Sculpture on his tomb—three handsome full-length figures, weeping—"

Remonencq waved the speaker away, in Auvergnat fashion, but the man replied with another gesture, which being interpreted means "Don't spoil sport;" a piece of commercial free-masonry, as it were, which the dealer understood.

"I represent the firm of Sonet and Company, monumental stone-masons; Sir Walter Scott would have dubbed me Young Mortality," continued this person. "If you, sir, should decide to intrust your orders to us, we would spare you the trouble of the journey to purchase the ground necessary for the interment of a friend lost to the arts—"

At this Remonencq nodded assent, and jogged Schmucke's elbow.

"Every day we receive orders from families to arrange all formalities," continued he of the black coat, thus encouraged by Remonencq. "In the first moment of bereavement, the heir-at-law finds it very difficult to attend to such matters, and we are accustomed to perform these little services for our clients. Our charges, sir, are on a fixed scale, so much per foot, freestone or marble. Family vaults a specialty.—We undertake everything at the most moderate prices. Our firm executed the magnificent monument erected to the fair Esther Gobseck and Lucien de Rubempre, one of the finest ornaments of Pere-Lachaise. We only employ the best workmen, and I must warn you, sir, against small contractors—who turn out nothing but trash," he added, seeing that another person in a black suit was coming up to say a word for another firm of marble-workers.

It is often said that "death is the end of a journey," but the aptness of the simile is realized most fully in Paris. Any arrival, especially of a person of condition, upon the "dark brink," is hailed in much the same way as the traveler recently landed is hailed by hotel touts and pestered with their recommendations. With the exception of a few philosophically-minded persons, or here and there a family secure of handing down a name to posterity, nobody thinks beforehand of the practical aspects of death. Death always comes before he is expected; and, from a sentiment easy to understand, the heirs usually act as if the event were impossible. For which reason, almost every one that loses father or mother, wife or child, is immediately beset by scouts that profit by the confusion caused by grief to snare others. In former days, agents for monuments used to live round about the famous cemetery of Pere-Lachaise, and were gathered together in a single thoroughfare, which should by rights have been called the Street of Tombs; issuing thence, they fell upon the relatives of the dead as they came from the cemetery, or even at the grave-side. But competition and the spirit of speculation induced them to spread themselves further and further afield, till descending into Paris itself they reached the very precincts of the mayor's office. Indeed, the stone-mason's agent has often been known to invade the house of mourning with a design for the sepulchre in his hand.

"I am in treaty with this gentleman," said the representative of the firm of Sonet to another agent who came up.

"Pons deceased!..." called the clerk at this moment. "Where are the witnesses?"

"This way, sir," said the stone-mason's agent, this time addressing Remonencq.

Schmucke stayed where he had been placed on the bench, an inert mass. Remonencq begged the agent to help him, and together they pulled Schmucke towards the balustrade, behind which the registrar shelters himself from the mourning public. Remonencq, Schmucke's Providence, was assisted by Dr. Poulain, who filled in the necessary information as to Pons' age and birthplace; the German knew but one thing—that Pons was his friend. So soon as the signatures were affixed, Remonencq and the doctor (followed by the stone-mason's man), put Schmucke into a cab, the desperate agent whisking in afterwards, bent upon taking a definite order. La Sauvage, on the lookout in the gateway, half-carried Schmucke's almost unconscious form upstairs. Remonencq and the agent went up with her.

"He will be ill!" exclaimed the agent, anxious to make an end of the piece of business which, according to him, was in progress.

"I should think he will!" returned Mme. Sauvage. "He has been crying for twenty-four hours on end, and he would not take anything. There is nothing like grief for giving one a sinking in the stomach."

"My dear client," urged the representative of the firm of Sonet, "do take some broth. You have so much to do; some one must go to the Hotel de Ville to buy the ground in the cemetery on which you mean to erect a monument to perpetuate the memory of the friend of the arts, and bear record to your gratitude."

"Why, there is no sense in this!" added Mme. Cantinet, coming in with broth and bread.

"If you are as weak as this, you ought to think of finding some one to act for you," added Remonencq, "for you have a good deal on your hands, my dear sir. There is the funeral to order. You would not have your friend buried like a pauper!"

"Come, come, my dear sir," put in La Sauvage, seizing a moment when Schmucke laid his head back in the great chair to pour a spoonful of soup into his mouth.

She fed him as if he had been a child, and almost in spite of himself.

"Now, if you were wise, sir, since you are inclined to give yourself up quietly to grief, you would find some one to act for you—"

"As you are thinking of raising a magnificent monument to the memory of your friend, sir, you have only to leave it all to me; I will undertake—"

"What is all this? What is all this?" asked La Sauvage. "Has M. Schmucke ordered something? Who may you be?"

"I represent the firm of Sonet, my dear madame, the biggest monumental stone-masons in Paris," said the person in black, handing a business-card to the stalwart Sauvage.

"Very well, that will do. Some one will go with you when the time comes; but you must not take advantage of the gentleman's condition now. You can quite see that he is not himself——"

The agent led her out upon the landing. "If you will undertake to get the order for us," he said confidentially, "I am empowered to offer you forty francs."

Mme. Sauvage grew placable. "Very well, let me have your address," said she.

Schmucke meantime being left to himself, and feeling the stronger for the soup and bread that he had been forced to swallow, returned at once to Pons' rooms, and to his prayers. He had lost himself in the fathomless depths of sorrow, when a voice sounding in his ears drew him back from the abyss of grief, and a young man in a suit of black returned for the eleventh time to the charge, pulling the poor, tortured victim's coatsleeve until he listened. "Sir!" said he.

"Vat ees it now?"

"Sir! we owe a supreme discovery to Dr. Gannal; we do not dispute his fame; he has worked miracles of Egypt afresh; but there have been improvements made upon his system. We have obtained surprising results. So, if you would like to see your friend again, as he was when he was alive—"

"See him again!" cried Schmucke. "Shall he speak to me?"

"Not exactly. Speech is the only thing wanting," continued the embalmer's agent. "But he will remain as he is after embalming for all eternity. The operation is over in a few seconds. Just an incision in the carotid artery and an injection.—But it is high time; if you wait one single quarter of an hour, sir, you will not have the sweet satisfaction of preserving the body...."

"Go to der teufel!... Bons is ein spirit—und dat spirit is in hefn."

"That man has no gratitude in his composition," remarked the youthful agent of one of the famous Gannal's rivals; "he will not embalm his friend."

The words were spoken under the archway, and addressed to La Cibot, who had just submitted her beloved to the process. "What would you have, sir!" she said. "He is the heir, the universal legatee. As soon as they get what they want, the dead are nothing to them."





LXVIII


An hour later, Schmucke saw Mme. Sauvage come into the room, followed by another man in a suit of black, a workman, to all appearance. Cantinet has been so obliging as to send this gentleman, sir," she said; "he is coffin-maker to the parish."

The coffin-maker made his bow with a sympathetic and com-passionate air, but none the less he had a business-like look, and seemed to know that he was indispensable. He turned an expert's eye upon the dead.

"How does the gentleman wish 'it' to be made? Deal, plain oak, or oak lead-lined? Oak with a lead lining is the best style. The body is a stock size."

He felt for the feet, and proceeded to take the measure. One metre seventy!" he added. "You will be thinking of ordering the funeral service at the church, sir, no doubt?"

Schmucke looked at him as a dangerous madman might look before striking a blow. La Sauvage put in a word.

"You ought to find somebody to look after all these things," she said.

"Yes——" the victim murmured at length.

"Shall I fetch M. Tabareau?—for you will have a good deal on your hands before long. M. Tabareau is the most honest man in the quarter, you see."

"Yes. Mennesir Dapareau! Somepody vas speaking of him chust now—" said Schmucke, completely beaten.

"Very well. You can be quiet, sir, and give yourself up to grief, when you have seen your deputy."

It was nearly two o'clock when M. Tabareau's head-clerk, a young man who aimed at a bailiff's career, modestly presented himself. Youth has wonderful privileges; no one is alarmed by youth. This young man Villemot by name, sat down by Schmucke's side and waited his opportunity to speak. His diffidence touched Schmucke very much.

"I am M. Tabareau's head-clerk, sir," he said; "he sent me here to take charge of your interests, and to superintend the funeral arrangements. Is this your wish?"

"You cannot safe my life, I haf not long to lif; but you vill leaf me in beace!"

"Oh! you shall not be disturbed," said Villemot.

"Ver' goot. Vat must I do for dat?"

"Sign this paper appointing M. Tabareau to act for you in all matters relating to the settlement of the affairs of the deceased."

"Goot! gif it to me," said Schmucke, anxious only to sign it at once.

"No, I must read it over to you first."

"Read it ofer."

Schmucke paid not the slightest attention to the reading of the power of attorney, but he set his name to it. The young clerk took Schmucke's orders for the funeral, the interment, and the burial service; undertaking that he should not be troubled again in any way, nor asked for money.

"I vould gif all dat I haf to be left in beace," said the unhappy man. And once more he knelt beside the dead body of his friend.

Fraisier had triumphed. Villemot and La Sauvage completed the circle which he had traced about Pons' heir.

There is no sorrow that sleep cannot overcome. Towards the end of the day La Sauvage, coming in, found Schmucke stretched asleep at the bed-foot. She carried him off, put him to bed, tucked him in maternally, and till the morning Schmucke slept. When he awoke, or rather when the truce was over and he again became conscious of his sorrows, Pons' coffin lay under the gateway in such a state as a third-class funeral may claim, and Schmucke, seeking vainly for his friend, wandered from room to room, across vast spaces, as it seemed to him, empty of everything save hideous memories. La Sauvage took him in hand, much as a nurse manages a child; she made him take his breakfast before starting for the church; and while the poor sufferer forced himself to eat, she discovered, with lamentations worthy of Jeremiah, that he had not a black coat in his possession. La Cibot took entire charge of his wardrobe; since Pons fell ill, his apparel, like his dinner, had been reduced to the lowest terms—to a couple of coats and two pairs of trousers.

"And you are going just as you are to M. Pons' funeral? It is an unheard-of thing; the whole quarter will cry shame upon us!"

"Und how vill you dat I go?"

"Why, in mourning—"

"Mourning!"

"It is the proper thing."

"Der bropper ding!... Confound all dis stupid nonsense!" cried poor Schmucke, driven to the last degree of exasperation which a childlike soul can reach under stress of sorrow.

"Why, the man is a monster of ingratitude!" said La Sauvage, turning to a personage who just then appeared. At the sight of this functionary Schmucke shuddered.

The newcomer wore a splendid suit of black, black knee-breeches, black silk stockings, a pair of white cuffs, an extremely correct white muslin tie, and white gloves. A silver chain with a coin attached ornamented his person. A typical official, stamped with the official expression of decorous gloom, an ebony wand in his hand by way of insignia of office, he stood waiting with a three-cornered hat adorned with the tricolor cockade under his arm.

"I am the master of the ceremonies," this person remarked in a subdued voice. Accustomed daily to superintend funerals, to move among families plunged in one and the same kind of tribulation, real or feigned, this man, like the rest of his fraternity, spoke in hushed and soothing tones; he was decorous, polished, and formal, like an allegorical stone figure of Death.

Schmucke quivered through every nerve as if he were confronting his executioner.

"Is this gentleman the son, brother, or father of the deceased?" inquired the official.

"I am all dat and more pesides—I am his friend," said Schmucke through a torrent of weeping.

"Are you his heir?"

"Heir?..." repeated Schmucke. "Noding matters to me more in dis vorld," returning to his attitude of hopeless sorrow.

"Where are the relatives, the friends?" asked the master of the ceremonies.

"All here!" exclaimed the German, indicating the pictures and rarities. "Not von of dem haf efer gifn bain to mein boor Bons.... Here ees everydings dot he lofed, after me."

Schmucke had taken his seat again, and looked as vacant as before; he dried his eyes mechanically. Villemot came up at that moment; he had ordered the funeral, and the master of the ceremonies, recognizing him, made an appeal to the newcomer.

"Well, sir, it is time to start. The hearse is here; but I have not often seen such a funeral as this. Where are the relatives and friends?"

"We have been pressed for time," replied Villemot. "This gentleman was in such deep grief that he could think of nothing. And there is only one relative."

The master of the ceremonies looked compassionately at Schmucke; this expert in sorrow knew real grief when he saw it. He went across to him.

"Come, take heart, my dear sir. Think of paying honor to your friend's memory."

"We forgot to send out cards; but I took care to send a special message to M. le Presidente de Marville, the one relative that I mentioned to you.—There are no friends.—M. Pons was conductor of an orchestra at a theatre, but I do not think that any one will come.—This gentleman is the universal legatee, I believe."

"Then he ought to be chief mourner," said the master of the ceremonies.

"Have you a black coat?" he continued, noticing Schmucke's costume.

"I am all in plack insite!" poor Schmucke replied in heartrending tones; "so plack it is dot I feel death in me.... Gott in hefn is going to haf pity upon me; He vill send me to mein friend in der grafe, und I dank Him for it—" He clasped his hands.

"I have told our management before now that we ought to have a wardrobe department and lend the proper mourning costumes on hire," said the master of the ceremonies, addressing Villemot; "it is a want that is more and more felt every day, and we have even now introduced improvements. But as this gentleman is chief mourner, he ought to wear a cloak, and this one that I have brought with me will cover him from head to foot; no one need know that he is not in proper mourning costume.—Will you be so kind as to rise?"

Schmucke rose, but he tottered on his feet.

"Support him," said the master of the ceremonies, turning to Villemot; "you are his legal representative."

Villemot held Schmucke's arm while the master of the ceremonies invested Schmucke with the ample, dismal-looking garment worn by heirs-at-law in the procession to and from the house and the church. He tied the black silken cords under the chin, and Schmucke as heir was in "full dress."

"And now comes a great difficulty," continued the master of the ceremonies; "we want four bearers for the pall.... If nobody comes to the funeral, who is to fill the corners? It is half-past ten already," he added, looking at his watch; "they are waiting for us at the church."

"Oh! here comes Fraisier!" Villemot exclaimed, very imprudently; but there was no one to hear the tacit confession of complicity.

"Who is this gentleman?" inquired the master of the ceremonies.

"Oh! he comes on behalf of the family."

"Whose family?"

"The disinherited family. He is M. Camusot de Marville's repre-sentative."

"Good," said the master of the ceremonies, with a satisfied air. "We shall have two pall-bearers at any rate—you and he."

And, happy to find two of the places filled up, he took out some wonderful white buckskin gloves, and politely presented Fraisier and Villemot with a pair apiece.

"If you gentlemen will be so good as to act as pall-bearers—" said he.

Fraisier, in black from head to foot, pretentiously dressed, with his white tie and official air, was a sight to shudder at; he embodied a hundred briefs.

"Willingly, sir," said he.

"If only two more persons will come, the four corners will be filled up," said the master of the ceremonies.

At that very moment the indefatigable representative of the firm of Sonet came up, and, closely following him, the man who remembered Pons and thought of paying him a last tribute of respect. This was a supernumerary at the theatre, the man who put out the scores on the music-stands for the orchestra. Pons had been wont to give him a five-franc piece once a month, knowing that he had a wife and family.

"Oh, Dobinard (Topinard)!" Schmucke cried out at the sight of him, "you love Bons!"

"Why, I have come to ask news of M. Pons every morning, sir."

"Efery morning! boor Dobinard!" and Schmucke squeezed the man's hand.

"But they took me for a relation, no doubt, and did not like my visits at all. I told them that I belonged to the theatre and came to inquire after M. Pons; but it was no good. They saw through that dodge, they said. I asked to see the poor dear man, but they never would let me come upstairs."

"Dat apominable Zipod!" said Schmucke, squeezing Topinard's horny hand to his heart.

"He was the best of men, that good M. Pons. Every month he use to give me five francs.... He knew that I had three children and a wife. My wife has gone to the church."

"I shall difide mein pread mit you," cried Schmucke, in his joy at finding at his side some one who loved Pons.

"If this gentleman will take a corner of the pall, we shall have all four filled up," said the master of the ceremonies.

There had been no difficulty over persuading the agent for monuments. He took a corner the more readily when he was shown the handsome pair of gloves which, according to custom, was to be his property.

"A quarter to eleven! We absolutely must go down. They are waiting for us at the church."

The six persons thus assembled went down the staircase. The cold-blooded lawyer remained a moment to speak to the two women on the landing.

"Stop here, and let nobody come in," he said, "especially if you wish to remain in charge, Mme. Cantinet. Aha! two francs a day, you know!"

By a coincidence in nowise extraordinary in Paris, two hearses were waiting at the door, and two coffins standing under the archway; Cibot's funeral and the solitary state in which Pons was lying was made even more striking in the street. Schmucke was the only mourner that followed Pons' coffin; Schmucke, supported by one of the undertaker's men, for he tottered at every step. From the Rue de Normandie to the Rue d'Orleans and the Church of Saint-Francois the two funerals went between a double row of curious onlookers for everything (as was said before) makes a sensation in the quarter. Every one remarked the splendor of the white funeral car, with a big embroidered P suspended on a hatchment, and the one solitary mourner behind it; while the cheap bier that came after it was followed by an immense crowd. Happily, Schmucke was so bewildered by the throng of idlers and the rows of heads in the windows, that he heard no remarks and only saw the faces through a mist of tears.

"Oh, it is the nutcracker!" said one, "the musician, you know—"

"Who can the pall-bearers be?"

"Pooh! play-actors."

"I say, just look at poor old Cibot's funeral. There is one worker the less. What a man! he could never get enough of work!"

"He never went out."

"He never kept Saint Monday."

"How fond he was of his wife!"

"Ah! There is an unhappy woman!"

Remonencq walked behind his victim's coffin. People condoled with him on the loss of his neighbor.

The two funerals reached the church. Cantinet and the doorkeeper saw that no beggars troubled Schmucke. Villemot had given his word that Pons' heir should be left in peace; he watched over his client, and gave the requisite sums; and Cibot's humble bier, escorted by sixty or eighty persons, drew all the crowd after it to the cemetery. At the church door Pons' funeral possession mustered four mourning-coaches, one for the priest and three for the relations; but one only was required, for the representative of the firm of Sonet departed during mass to give notice to his principal that the funeral was on the way, so that the design for the monument might be ready for the survivor at the gates of the cemetery. A single coach sufficed for Fraisier, Villemot, Schmucke, and Topinard; but the remaining two, instead of returning to the undertaker, followed in the procession to Pere-Lachaise—a useless procession, not unfrequently seen; there are always too many coaches when the dead are unknown beyond their own circle and there is no crowd at the funeral. Dear, indeed, the dead must have been in their lifetime if relative or friend will go with them so far as the cemetery in this Paris, where every one would fain have twenty-five hours in the day. But with the coachmen it is different; they lose their tips if they do not make the journey; so, empty or full, the mourning coaches go to the church and cemetery and return to the house for gratuities. A death is a sort of drinking-fountain for an unimagined crowd of thirsty mortals. The attendants at the church, the poor, the undertaker's men, the drivers and sextons, are creatures like sponges that dip into a hearse and come out again saturated. From the church door, where he was beset with a swarm of beggars (promptly dispersed by the beadle), to Pere-Lachaise, poor Schmucke went as criminals went in old times from the Palais de Justice to the Place de Greve. It was his own funeral that he followed, clinging to Topinard's hand, to the one living creature besides himself who felt a pang of real regret for Pons' death. As for Topinard, greatly touched by the honor of the request to act as pall-bearer, content to drive in a carriage, the possessor of a new pair of gloves,—it began to dawn upon him that this was to be one of the great days of his life. Schmucke was driven passively along the road, as some unlucky calf is driven in a butcher's cart to the slaughter-house. Fraisier and Villemot sat with their backs to the horses. Now, as those know whose sad fortune it has been to accompany many of their friends to their last resting-place, all hypocrisy breaks down in the coach during the journey (often a very long one) from the church to the eastern cemetery, to that one of the burying-grounds of Paris in which all vanities, all kinds of display, are met, so rich is it in sumptuous monuments. On these occasions those who feel least begin to talk soonest, and in the end the saddest listen, and their thoughts are diverted.

"M. le President had already started for the Court." Fraisier told Villemot, "and I did not think it necessary to tear him away from business; he would have come too late, in any case. He is the next-of-kin; but as he has been disinherited, and M. Schmucke gets everything, I thought that if his legal representative were present it would be enough."

Topinard lent an ear to this.

"Who was the queer customer that took the fourth corner?" continued Fraisier.

"He is an agent for a firm of monumental stone-masons. He would like an order for a tomb, on which he proposes to put three sculptured marble figures—Music, Painting, and Sculpture shedding tears over the deceased."

"It is an idea," said Fraisier; "the old gentleman certainly deserved that much; but the monument would cost seven or eight hundred francs."

"Oh! quite that!"

"If M. Schmucke gives the order, it cannot affect the estate. You might eat up a whole property with such expenses."

"There would be a lawsuit, but you would gain it—"

"Very well," said Fraisier, "then it will be his affair.—It would be a nice practical joke to play upon the monument-makers," Fraisier added in Villemot's ear; "for if the will is upset (and I can answer for that), or if there is no will at all, who would pay them?"

Villemot grinned like a monkey, and the pair began to talk confidentially, lowering their voices; but the man from the theatre, with his wits and senses sharpened in the world behind the scenes, could guess at the nature of their discourse; in spite of the rumbling of the carriage and other hindrances, he began to understand that these representatives of justice were scheming to plunge poor Schmucke into difficulties; and when at last he heard the ominous word "Clichy," the honest and loyal servitor of the stage made up his mind to watch over Pons' friend.

At the cemetery, where three square yards of ground had been purchased through the good offices of the firm of Sonet (Villemot having announced Schmucke's intention of erecting a magnificent monument), the master of ceremonies led Schmucke through a curious crowd to the grave into which Pons' coffin was about to be lowered; but here, at the sight of the square hole, the four men waiting with ropes to lower the bier, and the clergy saying the last prayer for the dead at the grave-side, something clutched tightly at the German's heart. He fainted away.





LXXI


Sonet's agent and M. Sonet himself came to help Topinard to carry poor Schmucke into the marble-works hard by, where Mme. Sonet and Mme. Vitelot (Sonet's partner's wife) were eagerly prodigal of efforts to revive him. Topinard stayed. He had seen Fraisier in conversation with Sonet's agent, and Fraisier, in his opinion, had gallows-bird written on his face.

An hour later, towards half-past two o'clock, the poor, innocent German came to himself. Schmucke thought that he had been dreaming for the past two days; if he could only wake, he should find Pons still alive. So many wet towels had been laid on his forehead, he had been made to inhale salts and vinegar to such an extent, that he opened his eyes at last. Mme. Sonet make him take some meat-soup, for they had put the pot on the fire at the marble-works.

"Our clients do not often take things to heart like this; still, it happens once in a year or two—"

At last Schmucke talked of returning to the Rue de Normandie, and at this Sonet began at once.

"Here is the design, sir," he said; "Vitelot drew it expressly for you, and sat up last night to do it.... And he has been happily inspired, it will look fine—"

"One of the finest in Pere-Lachaise!" said the little Mme. Sonet. "But you really ought to honor the memory of a friend who left you all his fortune."

The design, supposed to have been drawn on purpose, had, as a matter of fact, been prepared for de Marsay, the famous cabinet minister. His widow, however, had given the commission to Stidmann; people were disgusted with the tawdriness of the project, and it was refused. The three figures at that period represented the three days of July which brought the eminent minister to power. Subsequently, Sonet and Vitelot had turned the Three Glorious Days—"les trois glorieuses"—into the Army, Finance, and the Family, and sent in the design for the sepulchre of the late lamented Charles Keller; and here again Stidmann took the commission. In the eleven years that followed, the sketch had been modified to suit all kinds of requirements, and now in Vitelot's fresh tracing they reappeared as Music, Sculpture, and Painting.

"It is a mere trifle when you think of the details and cost of setting it up; for it will take six months," said Vitelot. "Here is the estimate and the order-form—seven thousand francs, sketch in plaster not included."

"If M. Schmucke would like marble," put in Sonet (marble being his special department), "it would cost twelve thousand francs, and monsieur would immortalize himself as well as his friend."

Topinard turned to Vitelot. "I have just heard that they are going to dispute the will," he whispered, "and the relatives are likely to come by their property. Go and speak to M. Camusot, for this poor, harmless creature has not a farthing."

"This is the kind of customer that you always bring us," said Mme. Vitelot, beginning a quarrel with the agent.

Topinard led Schmucke away, and they returned home on foot to the Rue de Normandie, for the mourning-coaches had been sent back.

"Do not leaf me," Schmucke said, when Topinard had seen him safe into Mme. Sauvage's hands, and wanted to go.

"It is four o'clock, dear M. Schmucke. I must go home to dinner. My wife is a box-opener—she will not know what has become of me. The theatre opens at a quarter to six, you know."

"Yes, I know... but remember dat I am alone in die earth, dat I haf no friend. You dat haf shed a tear for Bons enliden me; I am in teep tarkness, und Bons said dat I vas in der midst of shcoundrels."

"I have seen that plainly already; I have just prevented them from sending you to Clichy."

"Gligy!" repeated Schmucke; "I do not understand."

"Poor man! Well, never mind, I will come to you. Good-bye."

"Goot-bye; komm again soon," said Schmucke, dropping half-dead with weariness.

"Good-bye, mosieu," said Mme. Sauvage, and there was something in her tone that struck Topinard.

"Oh, come, what is the matter now?" he asked, banteringly. "You are attitudinizing like a traitor in a melodrama."

"Traitor yourself! Why have you come meddling here? Do you want to have a hand in the master's affairs, and swindle him, eh?"

"Swindle him!... Your very humble servant!" Topinard answered with superb disdain. "I am only a poor super at a theatre, but I am something of an artist, and you may as well know that I never asked anything of anybody yet! Who asked anything of you? Who owes you anything? eh, old lady!"

"You are employed at a theatre, and your name is—?"

"Topinard, at your service."

"Kind regards to all at home," said La Sauvage, "and my compliments to your missus, if you are married, mister.... That was all I wanted to know."

"Why, what is the matter, dear?" asked Mme. Cantinet, coming out.

"This, child—stop here and look after the dinner while I run round to speak to monsieur."

"He is down below, talking with poor Mme. Cibot, that is crying her eyes out," said Mme. Cantinet.

La Sauvage dashed down in such headlong haste that the stairs trembled beneath her tread.

"Monsieur!" she called, and drew him aside a few paces to point out Topinard.

Topinard was just going away, proud at heart to have made some return already to the man who had done him so many kindnesses. He had saved Pons' friend from a trap, by a stratagem from that world behind the scenes in which every one has more or less ready wit. And within himself he vowed to protect a musician in his orchestra from future snares set for his simple sincerity.

"Do you see that little wretch?" said La Sauvage. "He is a kind of honest man that has a mind to poke his nose into M. Schmucke's affairs."

"Who is he?" asked Fraisier.

"Oh! he is a nobody."

"In business there is no such thing as a nobody."

"Oh, he is employed at the theatre," said she; "his name is Topinard."

"Good, Mme. Sauvage! Go on like this, and you shall have your tobacconist's shop."

And Fraisier resumed his conversation with Mme. Cibot.

"So I say, my dear client, that you have not played openly and above-board with me, and that one is not bound in any way to a partner who cheats."

"And how have I cheated you?" asked La Cibot, hands on hips. "Do you think that you will frighten me with your sour looks and your frosty airs? You look about for bad reasons for breaking your promises, and you call yourself an honest man! Do you know what you are? You are a blackguard! Yes! yes! scratch your arm; but just pocket that—"

"No words, and keep your temper, dearie. Listen to me. You have been feathering your nest.... I found this catalogue this morning while we were getting ready for the funeral; it is all in M. Pons' handwriting, and made out in duplicate. And as it chanced, my eyes fell on this—"

And opening the catalogue, he read:

No. 7. Magnificent portrait painted on marble, by Sebastian del Piombo, in 1546. Sold by a family who had it removed from Terni Cathedral. The picture, which represents a Knight-Templar kneeling in prayer, used to hang above a tomb of the Rossi family with a companion portrait of a Bishop, afterwards purchased by an Englishman. The portrait might be attributed to Raphael, but for the date. This example is, to my mind, superior to the portrait of Baccio Bandinelli in the Musee; the latter is a little hard, while the Templar, being painted upon 'lavagna,' or slate, has preserved its freshness of coloring.

"When I come to look for No. 7," continued Fraisier, "I find a portrait of a lady, signed 'Chardin,' without a number on it! I went through the pictures with the catalogue while the master of ceremonies was making up the number of pall-bearers, and found that eight of those indicated as works of capital importance by M. Pons had disappeared, and eight paintings of no special merit, and without numbers, were there instead.... And finally, one was missing altogether, a little panel-painting by Metzu, described in the catalogue as a masterpiece."

"And was I in charge of the pictures?" demanded La Cibot.

"No; but you were in a position of trust. You were M. Pons' housekeeper, you looked after his affairs, and he has been robbed—"

"Robbed! Let me tell you this, sir: M. Schmucke sold the pictures, by M. Pons' orders, to meet expenses."

"And to whom?"

"To Messrs. Elie Magus and Remonencq."

"For how much?"

"I am sure I do not remember."

"Look here, my dear madame; you have been feathering your nest, and very snugly. I shall keep an eye upon you; I have you safe. Help me, I will say nothing! In any case, you know that since you deemed it expedient to plunder M. le President Camusot, you ought not to expect anything from him."

"I was sure that this would all end in smoke, for me," said La Cibot, mollified by the words "I will say nothing." Remonencq chimed in at this point.





LXXII


"Here are you finding fault with Mme. Cibot; that is not right!" he said. "The pictures were sold by private treaty between M. Pons, M. Magus, and me. We waited for three days before we came to terms with the deceased; he slept on his pictures. We took receipts in proper form; and if we gave Madame Cibot a few forty-franc pieces, it is the custom of the trade—we always do so in private houses when we conclude a bargain. Ah! my dear sir, if you think to cheat a defenceless woman, you will not make a good bargain! Do you understand, master lawyer?—M. Magus rules the market, and if you do not come down off the high horse, if you do not keep your word to Mme. Cibot, I shall wait till the collection is sold, and you shall see what you will lose if you have M. Magus and me against you; we can get the dealers in a ring. Instead of realizing seven or eight hundred thousand francs, you will not so much as make two hundred thousand."

"Good, good, we shall see. We are not going to sell; or if we do, it will be in London."

"We know London," said Remonencq. "M. Magus is as powerful there as at Paris."

"Good-day, madame; I shall sift these matters to the bottom," said Fraisier—"unless you continue to do as I tell you" he added.

"You little pickpocket!—"

"Take care! I shall be a justice of the peace before long."

And with threats understood to the full upon either side, they separated.

"Thank you, Remonencq!" said La Cibot; "it is very pleasant to a poor widow to find a champion."

Towards ten o'clock that evening, Gaudissart sent for Topinard. The manager was standing with his back to the fire, in a Napoleonic attitude—a trick which he had learned since be began to command his army of actors, dancers, figurants, musicians, and stage carpenters. He grasped his left-hand brace with his right hand, always thrust into his waistcoat; the head was flung far back, his eyes gazed out into space.

"Ah! I say, Topinard, have you independent means?"

"No, sir."

"Are you on the lookout to better yourself somewhere else?"

"No, sir—" said Topinard, with a ghastly countenance.

"Why, hang it all, your wife takes the first row of boxes out of respect to my predecessor, who came to grief; I gave you the job of cleaning the lamps in the wings in the daytime, and you put out the scores. And that is not all, either. You get twenty sous for acting monsters and managing devils when a hell is required. There is not a super that does not covet your post, and there are those that are jealous of you, my friend; you have enemies in the theatre."

"Enemies!" repeated Topinard.

"And you have three children; the oldest takes children's parts at fifty centimes—"

"Sir!—"

"You want to meddle in other people's business, and put your finger into a will case.—Why, you wretched man, you would be crushed like an egg-shell! My patron is His Excellency, Monseigneur le Comte Popinot, a clever man and a man of high character, whom the King in his wisdom has summoned back to the privy council. This statesman, this great politician, has married his eldest son to a daughter of M. le President de Marville, one of the foremost men among the high courts of justice; one of the leading lights of the law-courts. Do you know the law-courts? Very good. Well, he is cousin and heir to M. Pons, to our old conductor whose funeral you attended this morning. I do not blame you for going to pay the last respects to him, poor man.... But if you meddle in M. Schmucke's affairs, you will lose your place. I wish very well to M. Schmucke, but he is in a delicate position with regard to the heirs—and as the German is almost nothing to me, and the President and Count Popinot are a great deal, I recommend you to leave the worthy German to get out of his difficulties by himself. There is a special Providence that watches over Germans, and the part of deputy guardian-angel would not suit you at all. Do you see? Stay as you are—you cannot do better."

"Very good, monsieur le directeur," said Topinard, much distressed.

And in this way Schmucke lost the protector sent to him by fate, the one creature that shed a tear for Pons, the poor super for whose return he looked on the morrow. Next morning poor Schmucke awoke to a sense of his great and heavy loss. He looked round the empty rooms. Yesterday and the day before yesterday the preparations for the funeral had made a stir and bustle which distracted his eyes; but the silence which follows the day, when the friend, father, son, or loved wife has been laid in the grave—the dull, cold silence of the morrow is terrible, is glacial. Some irresistible force drew him to Pons' chamber, but the sight of it was more than the poor man could bear; he shrank away and sat down in the dining-room, where Mme. Sauvage was busy making breakfast ready. Schmucke drew his chair to the table, but he could eat nothing.





LXXIII


A sudden, somewhat sharp ringing of the door-bell rang through the house, and Mme. Cantinet and Mme. Sauvage allowed three black-coated personages to pass. First came Vitel, the justice of the peace, with his highly respectable clerk; third was Fraisier, neither sweeter nor milder for the disappointing discovery of a valid will canceling the formidable instrument so audaciously stolen by him.

"We have come to affix seals on the property," the justice of the peace said gently, addressing Schmucke.

But the remark was Greek to Schmucke; he gazed in dismay at his three visitors.

"We have come at the request of M. Fraisier, legal representative of M. Camusot de Marville, heir of the late Pons—" added the clerk.

"The collection is here in this great room, and in the bedroom of the deceased," remarked Fraisier.

"Very well, let us go into the next room.—Pardon us, sir; do not let us interrupt with your breakfast."

The invasion struck an icy chill of terror into poor Schmucke.

Fraisier's venomous glances seemed to possess some magnetic influence over his victims, like the power of a spider over a fly. "M. Schmucke understood how to turn a will, made in the presence of a notary, to his own advantage," he said, "and he surely must have expected some opposition from the family. A family does not allow itself to be plundered by a stranger without some protest; and we shall see, sir, which carries the day—fraud and corruption or the rightful heirs.... We have a right as next of kin to affix seals, and seals shall be affixed. I mean to see that the precaution is taken with the utmost strictness."

"Ach, mein Gott! how haf I offended against Hefn?" cried the innocent Schmucke.

"There is a good deal of talk about you in the house," said La Sauvage. "While you were asleep, a little whipper-snapper in a black suit came here, a puppy that said he was M. Hannequin's head-clerk, and must see you at all costs; but as you were asleep and tired out with the funeral yesterday, I told him that M. Villemot, Tabareau's head-clerk, was acting for you, and if it was a matter of business, I said, he might speak to M. Villemot. 'Ah, so much the better!' the youngster said. 'I shall come to an understanding with him. We will deposit the will at the Tribunal, after showing it to the President.' So at that, I told him to ask M. Villemot to come here as soon as he could.—Be easy, my dear sir, there are those that will take care of you. They shall not shear the fleece off your back. You will have some one that has beak and claws. M. Villemot will give them a piece of his mind. I have put myself in a passion once already with that abominable hussy, La Cibot, a porter's wife that sets up to judge her lodgers, forsooth, and insists that you have filched the money from the heirs; you locked M. Pons up, she says, and worked upon him till he was stark, staring mad. She got as good as she gave, though, the wretched woman. 'You are a thief and a bad lot,' I told her; 'you will get into the police-courts for all the things that you have stolen from the gentlemen,' and she shut up."

The clerk came out to speak to Schmucke. "Would you wish to be present, sir, when the seals are affixed in the next room?"

"Go on, go on," said Schmucke; "I shall pe allowed to die in beace, I bresume?"

"Oh, under any circumstances a man has a right to die," the clerk answered, laughing; "most of our business relates to wills. But, in my experience, the universal legatee very seldom follows the testator to the tomb."

"I am going," said Schmucke. Blow after blow had given him an intolerable pain at the heart.

"Oh! here comes M. Villemot!" exclaimed La Sauvage.

"Mennesir Fillemod," said poor Schmucke, "rebresent me."

"I hurried here at once," said Villemot. "I have come to tell you that the will is completely in order; it will certainly be confirmed by the court,and you will be put in possession. You will have a fine fortune."

"I? Ein fein vordune?" cried Schmucke, despairingly. That he of all men should be suspected of caring for the money!

"And meantime what is the justice of the peace doing here with his wax candles and his bits of tape?" asked La Sauvage.

"Oh, he is affixing seals.... Come, M. Schmucke, you have a right to be present."

"No—go in yourself."

"But where is the use of the seals if M. Schmucke is in his ownhouse and everything belongs to him?" asked La Sauvage, doing justice in feminine fashion, and interpreting the Code according to their fancy, like one and all of her sex.

"M. Schmucke is not in possession, madame; he is in M. Pons' house. Everything will be his, no doubt; but the legatee cannot take possession without an authorization—an order from the Tribunal. And if the next-of-kin set aside by the testator should dispute the order, a lawsuit is the result. And as nobody knows what may happen, everything is sealed up, and the notaries representing either side proceed to draw up an inventory during the delay prescribed by the law.... And there you are!"

Schmucke, hearing such talk for the first time in his life, was completely bewildered by it; his head sank down upon the back of his chair—he could not support it, it had grown so heavy. Villemot meanwhile went off to chat with the justice of the peace and his clerk, assisting with professional coolness to affix the seals—a ceremony which always involves some buffoonery and plentiful comments on the objects thus secured, unless, indeed, one of the family happens to be present. At length the party sealed up the chamber and returned to the dining-room, whither the clerk betook himself. Schmucke watched the mechanical operation which consists in setting the justice's seal at either end of a bit of tape stretched across the opening of a folding-door; or, in the case of a cupboard or ordinary door, from edge to edge above the door-handle.

"Now for this room," said Fraisier, pointing to Schmucke's bedroom, which opened into the dining-room.

"But that is M. Schmucke's own room," remonstrated La Sauvage,springing in front of the door.

"We found the lease among the papers," Fraisier said ruthlessly; "there was no mention of M. Schmucke in it; it is taken out in M. Pons' name only. The whole place, and every room in it, is a part of the estate. And besides—" flinging open the door—"look here, monsieur le juge de la paix, it is full of pictures."

"So it is," answered the justice of the peace, and Fraisier thereupon gained his point.





LXXIV


"Wait a bit, gentlemen," said Villemot. "Do you know that you are turning the universal legatee out of doors, and as yet his right has not been called in question?"

"Yes, it has," said Fraisier; "we are opposing the transfer of the property."

"And upon what grounds?"

"You shall know that by and by, my boy," Fraisier replied, banteringly. "At this moment, if the legatee withdraws everything that he declares to be his, we shall raise no objections, but the room itself will be sealed. And M. Schmucke may lodge where he pleases."

"No," said Villemot; "M. Schmucke is going to stay in his room."

"And how?"

"I shall demand an immediate special inquiry," continued Villemot, "and prove that we pay half the rent. You shall not turn us out. Take away the pictures, decide on the ownership of the various articles, but here my client stops—'my boy.'"

"I shall go out!" the old musician suddenly said. He had recovered energy during the odious dispute.

"You had better," said Fraisier. "Your course will save expense to you, for your contention would not be made good. The lease is evidence—"

"The lease! the lease!" cried Villemot, "it is a question of good faith—"

"That could only be proved in a criminal case, by calling witnesses.—Do you mean to plunge into experts' fees and verifications, and orders to show cause why judgment should not be given, and law proceedings generally?"

"No, no!" cried Schmucke in dismay. "I shall turn out; I am used to it—"

In practice Schmucke was a philosopher, an unconscious cynic, so greatly had he simplified his life. Two pairs of shoes, a pair of boots, a couple of suits of clothes, a dozen shirts, a dozen bandana handkerchiefs, four waistcoats, a superb pipe given to him by Pons, with an embroidered tobacco-pouch—these were all his belongings. Overwrought by a fever of indignation, he went into his room and piled his clothes upon a chair.

"All dese are mine," he said, with simplicity worthy of Cincinnatus. "Der biano is also mine."

Fraisier turned to La Sauvage. "Madame, get help," he said;"take that piano out and put it on the landing."

"You are too rough into the bargain," said Villemot, addressing Fraisier. "The justice of the peace gives orders here; he is supreme."

"There are valuables in the room," put in the clerk.

"And besides," added the justice of the peace, "M. Schmucke is going out of his own free will."

"Did any one ever see such a client!" Villemot cried indignantly, turning upon Schmucke. "You are as limp as a rag—"

"Vat dos it matter vere von dies?" Schmucke said as he went out. "Dese men haf tiger faces.... I shall send somebody to vetch mein bits of dings."

"Where are you going, sir?"

"Vere it shall blease Gott," returned Pons' universal legatee with supreme indifference.

"Send me word," said Villemot.

Fraisier turned to the head-clerk. "Go after him," he whispered.

Mme. Cantinet was left in charge, with a provision of fifty francs paid out of the money that they found.

The justice of the peace looked out; there Schmucke stood in the courtyard looking up at the windows for the last time. "You have found a man of butter," remarked the justice.

"Yes," said Fraisier, "yes. The thing is as good as done. You need not hesitate to marry your granddaughter to Poulain; he will be head-surgeon at the Quinze-Vingts." (The Asylum founded by St. Louis for three hundred blind people.)

"We shall see.—Good-day, M. Fraisier," said the justice of the peace with a friendly air.

"There is a man with a head on his shoulders," remarked the justice's clerk. "The dog will go a long way."

By this time it was eleven o'clock. The old German went like an automaton down the road along which Pons and he had so often walked together. Wherever he went he saw Pons, he almost thought that Pons was by his side; and so he reached the theatre just as his friend Topinard was coming out of it after a morning spent in cleaning the lamps and meditating on the manager's tyranny.

"Oh, shoost der ding for me!" cried Schmucke, stopping his acquaintance. "Dopinart! you haf a lodging someveres, eh?"

"Yes, sir."

"A home off your own?"

"Yes, sir."

"Are you villing to take me for ein poarder? Oh! I shall pay ver' vell; I haf nine hundert vrancs of inkomm, und—I haf not ver' long ter lif.... I shall gif no drouble vatefer.... I can eat onydings—I only vant to shmoke mein bipe. Und—you are der only von dat haf shed a tear for Bons, mit me; und so, I lof you."

"I should be very glad, sir; but, to begin with, M. Gaudissart has given me a proper wigging—"

"Vigging?"

"That is one way of saying that he combed my hair for me. He gave me a scolding for meddling in your affairs.... So we must be very careful if you come to me. But I doubt whether you will stay when you have seen the place; you do not know how we poor devils live."

"I should rader der boor home of a goot-hearted mann dot haf mourned Bons, dan der Duileries mit men dot haf ein tiger face.... I haf chust left tigers in Bons' house; dey vill eat up everydings—"

"Come with me, sir, and you shall see. But—well, anyhow, there is a garret. Let us see what Mme. Topinard says."

Schmucke followed like a sheep, while Topinard led the way into one of the squalid districts which might be called the cancers of Paris—a spot known as the Cite Bordin. It is a slum out of the Rue de Bondy, a double row of houses run up by the speculative builder, under the shadow of the huge mass of the Porte Saint-Martin theatre. The pavement at the higher end lies below the level of the Rue de Bondy; at the lower it falls away towards the Rue des Mathurins du Temple. Follow its course and you find that it terminates in another slum running at right angles to the first—the Cite Bordin is, in fact, a T-shaped blind alley. Its two streets thus arranged contain some thirty houses, six or seven stories high; and every story, and every room in every story, is a workshop and a warehouse for goods of every sort and description, for this wart upon the face of Paris is a miniature Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Cabinet-work and brasswork, theatrical costumes, blown glass, painted porcelain—all the various fancy goods known as l'article Paris are made here. Dirty and productive like commerce, always full of traffic—foot-passengers, vans, and drays—the Cite Bourdin is an unsavory-looking neighborhood, with a seething population in keeping with the squalid surroundings. It is a not unintelligent artisan population, though the whole power of the intellect is absorbed by the day's manual labor. Topinard, like every other inhabitant of the Cite Bourdin, lived in it for the sake of comparatively low rent, the cause of its existence and prosperity. His sixth floor lodging, in the second house to the left, looked out upon the belt of green garden, still in existence, at the back of three or four large mansions in the Rue de Bondy.

Topinard's apartment consisted of a kitchen and two bedrooms. The first was a nursery with two little deal bedsteads and a cradle in it, the second was the bedroom, and the kitchen did duty as a dining-room. Above, reached by a short ladder, known among builders as a "trap-ladder," there was a kind of garret, six feet high, with a sash-window let into the roof. This room, given as a servants' bedroom, raised the Topinards' establishment from mere "rooms" to the dignity of a tenement, and the rent to a corresponding sum of four hundred francs. An arched lobby, lighted from the kitchen by a small round window, did duty as an ante-chamber, and filled the space between the bedroom, the kitchen, and house doors—three doors in all. The rooms were paved with bricks, and hung with a hideous wall-paper at threepence apiece; the chimneypieces that adorned them were of the kind called capucines—a shelf set on a couple of brackets painted to resemble wood. Here in these three rooms dwelt five human beings, three of them children. Any one, therefore, can imagine how the walls were covered with scores and scratches so far as an infant arm can reach.

Rich people can scarcely realize the extreme simplicity of a poor man's kitchen. A Dutch oven, a kettle, a gridiron, a saucepan, two or three dumpy cooking-pots, and a frying-pan—that was all. All the crockery in the place, white and brown earthenware together, was not worth more than twelve francs. Dinner was served on the kitchen table, which, with a couple of chairs and a couple of stools, completed the furniture. The stock of fuel was kept under the stove with a funnel-shaped chimney, and in a corner stood the wash-tub in which the family linen lay, often steeping over-night in soapsuds. The nursery ceiling was covered with clothes-lines, the walls were variegated with theatrical placards and wood-cuts from newspapers or advertisements. Evidently the eldest boy, the owner of the school-books stacked in a corner, was left in charge while his parents were absent at the theatre. In many a French workingman's family, so soon as a child reaches the age of six or seven, it plays the part of mother to younger sisters and brothers.

From this bare outline, it may be imagined that the Topinards, to use the hackneyed formula, were "poor but honest." Topinard himself was verging on forty; Mme. Topinard, once leader of a chorus—mistress, too, it was said, of Gaudissart's predecessor, was certainly thirty years old. Lolotte had been a fine woman in her day; but the misfortunes of the previous management had told upon her to such an extent, that it had seemed to her to be both advisable and necessary to contract a stage-marriage with Topinard. She did not doubt but that, as soon as they could muster the sum of a hundred and fifty francs, her Topinard would perform his vows agreeably to the civil law, were it only to legitimize the three children, whom he worshiped. Meantime, Mme. Topinard sewed for the theatre wardrobe in the morning; and with prodigious effort, the brave couple made nine hundred francs per annum between them.

"One more flight!" Topinard had twice repeated since they reached the third floor. Schmucke, engulfed in his sorrow, did not so much as know whether he was going up or coming down.

In another minute Topinard had opened the door; but before he appeared in his white workman's blouse Mme. Topinard's voice rang from the kitchen:

"There, there! children, be quiet! here comes papa!"

But the children, no doubt, did as they pleased with papa, for the oldest member of the family, sitting astride a broomstick, continued to command a charge of cavalry (a reminiscence of the Cirque-Olympique), the second blew a tin trumpet, while the third did its best to keep up with the main body of the army. Their mother was at work on a theatrical costume.

"Be quiet! or I shall slap you!" shouted Topinard in a formidable voice; then in an aside for Schmucke's benefit—"Always have to say that!—Here, little one," he continued, addressing his Lolotte, "this is M. Schmucke, poor M. Pons' friend. He does not know where to go, and he would like to live with us. I told him that we were not very spick-and-span up here, that we lived on the sixth floor, and had only the garret to offer him; but it was no use, he would come—"

Schmucke had taken the chair which the woman brought him, and the children, stricken with sudden shyness, had gathered together to give the stranger that mute, earnest, so soon-finished scrutiny characteristic of childhood. For a child, like a dog, is wont to judge by instinct rather than reason. Schmucke looked up; his eyes rested on that charming little picture; he saw the performer on the tin trumpet, a little five-year-old maiden with wonderful golden hair.

"She looks like ein liddle German girl," said Schmucke, holding out his arms to the child.

"Monsieur will not be very comfortable here," said Mme. Topinard. "I would propose that he should have our room at once, but I am obliged to have the children near me."

She opened the door as she spoke, and bade Schmucke come in. Such splendor as their abode possessed was all concentrated here. Blue cotton curtains with a white fringe hung from the mahogany bedstead, and adorned the window; the chest of drawers, bureau, and chairs, though all made of mahogany, were neatly kept. The clock and candlesticks on the chimneypiece were evidently the gift of the bankrupt manager, whose portrait, a truly frightful performance of Pierre Grassou's, looked down upon the chest of drawers. The children tried to peep in at the forbidden glories.

"Monsieur might be comfortable in here," said their mother.

"No, no," Schmucke replied. "Eh! I haf not ver' long to lif, I only vant a corner to die in."

The door was closed, and the three went up to the garret. "Dis is der ding for me," Schmucke cried at once. "Pefore I lifd mid Bons, I vas nefer better lodged."

"Very well. A truckle-bed, a couple of mattresses, a bolster, a pillow, a couple of chairs, and a table—that is all that you need to buy. That will not ruin you—it may cost a hundred and fifty francs, with the crockeryware and strip of carpet for the bedside."

Everything was settled—save the money, which was not forthcoming. Schmucke saw that his new friends were very poor, and recollecting that the theatre was only a few steps away, it naturally occurred to him to apply to the manager for his salary. He went at once, and found Gaudissart in his office. Gaudissart received him in the somewhat stiffly polite manner which he reserved for professionals. Schmucke's demand for a month's salary took him by surprise, but on inquiry he found that it was due.

"Oh, confound it, my good man, a German can always count, even if he has tears in his eyes.... I thought that you would have taken the thousand francs that I sent you into account, as a final year's salary, and that we were quits."

"We haf receifed nodings," said Schmucke; "und gif I komm to you, it ees because I am in der shtreet, und haf not ein benny. How did you send us der bonus?"

"By your portress."

"By Montame Zipod!" exclaimed Schmucke. "She killed Bons, she robbed him, she sold him—she tried to purn his vill—she is a pad creature, a monster!"

"But, my good man, how come you to be out in the street without a roof over your head or a penny in your pocket, when you are the sole heir? That does not necessarily follow, as the saying is."

"They haf put me out at der door. I am a voreigner, I know nodings of die laws."

"Poor man!" thought Gaudissart, foreseeing the probable end of the unequal contest.—"Listen," he began, "do you know what you ought to do in this business?"

"I haf ein mann of pizness!"

"Very good, come to terms at once with the next-of-kin; make them pay you a lump sum of money down and an annuity, and you can live in peace—"

"I ask noding more."

"Very well. Let me arrange it for you," said Gaudissart.

Fraisier had told him the whole story only yesterday, and he thought that he saw his way to making interest out of the case with the young Vicomtesse Popinot and her mother. He would finish a dirty piece of work, and some day he would be a privy councillor, at least; or so he told himself.

"I gif you full powers."

"Well. Let me see. Now, to begin with," said Gaudissart, Napoleon of the boulevard theatres, "to begin with, here are a hundred crowns—" (he took fifteen louis from his purse and handed them to Schmucke).

"That is yours, on account of six months' salary. If you leave the theatre, you can repay me the money. Now for your budget. What are your yearly expenses? How much do you want to be comfortable? Come, now, scheme out a life for a Sardanapalus—"

"I only need two suits of clothes, von for der vinter, von for der sommer."

"Three hundred francs," said Gaudissart.

"Shoes. Vour bairs."

"Sixty francs."

"Shtockings—"

"A dozen pairs—thirty-six francs."

"Half a tozzen shirts."

"Six calico shirts, twenty-four francs; as many linen shirts, forty-eight francs; let us say seventy-two. That makes four hundred and sixty-eight francs altogether.—Say five hundred, including cravats and pocket-handkerchiefs; a hundred francs for the laundress—six hundred. And now, how much for your board—three francs a day?"

"No, it ees too much."

"After all, you want hats; that brings it to fifteen hundred. Five hundred more for rent; that makes two thousand. If I can get two thousand francs per annum for you, are you willing?... Good securities."

"Und mein tobacco."

"Two thousand four hundred, then.... Oh! Papa Schmucke, do you call that tobacco? Very well, the tobacco shall be given in.—So that is two thousand four hundred francs per annum."

"Dat ees not all! I should like som monny."

"Pin-money!—Just so. Oh, these Germans! And calls himself an innocent, the old Robert Macaire!" thought Gaudissart. Aloud he said, "How much do you want? But this must be the last."

"It ees to bay a zacred debt."

"A debt!" said Gaudissart to himself. What a shark it is! He is worse than an eldest son. He will invent a bill or two next! We must cut this short. This Fraisier cannot take large views.—What debt is this, my good man? Speak out."

"Dere vas but von mann dot haf mourned Bons mit me.... He haf a tear liddle girl mit wunderschones haar; it vas as if I saw mein boor Deutschland dot I should nefer haf left.... Baris is no blace for die Germans; dey laugh at dem" (with a little nod as he spoke, and the air of a man who knows something of life in this world below).

"He is off his head," Gaudissart said to himself.

And a sudden pang of pity for this poor innocent before him brought a tear to the manager's eyes.

"Ah! you understand, mennesir le directeur! Ver' goot. Dat mann mit die liddle taughter is Dobinard, vat tidies der orchestra and lights die lamps. Bons vas fery fond of him, und helped him. He vas der only von dat accombanied mein only friend to die church und to die grafe.... I vant dree tausend vrancs for him, und dree tausend for die liddle von—"

"Poor fellow!" said Gaudissart to himself.

Rough, self-made man though he was, he felt touched by this nobleness of nature, by a gratitude for a mere trifle, as the world views it; though for the eyes of this divine innocence the trifle, like Bossuet's cup of water, was worth more than the victories of great captains. Beneath all Gaudissart's vanity, beneath the fierce desire to succeed in life at all costs,to rise to the social level of his old friend Popinot, there lay a warm heart and a kindly nature. Wherefore he canceled his too hasty judgments and went over to Schmucke's side.

"You shall have it all! But I will do better still, my dear Schmucke. Topinard is a good sort—"

"Yes. I haf chust peen to see him in his boor home, vere he ees happy mit his children—"

"I will give him the cashier's place. Old Baudrand is going to leave."

"Ah! Gott pless you!" cried Schmucke.

"Very well, my good, kind fellow, meet me at Berthier's office about four o'clock this afternoon. Everything shall be ready, and you shall be secured from want for the rest of your days. You shall draw your six thousand francs, and you shall have the same salary with Garangeot that you used to have with Pons."

"No," Schmucke answered. "I shall not lif.... I haf no heart for anydings; I feel that I am attacked—"

"Poor lamb!" Gaudissart muttered to himself as the German took his leave. "But, after all, one lives on mutton; and, as the sublime Beranger says, 'Poor sheep! you were made to be shorn,'" and he hummed the political squib by way of giving vent to his feelings. Then he rang for the office-boy.

"Call my carriage," he said.

"Rue de Hanovre," he told the coachman.

The man of ambitions by this time had reappeared; he saw the way to the Council of State lying straight before him.

And Schmucke? He was busy buying flowers and cakes for Topinard's children, and went home almost joyously.

"I am gifing die bresents..." he said, and he smiled.

It was the first smile for three months, but any one who had seen Schmucke's face would have shuddered to see it there.

"But dere is ein condition—"

"It is too kind of you, sir," said the mother.

"De liddle girl shall gif me a kiss and put die flowers in her hair, like die liddle German maidens—"

"Olga, child, do just as the gentleman wishes," said the mother, assuming an air of discipline.

"Do not scold mein liddle German girl," implored Schmucke. It seemed to him that the little one was his dear Germany. Topinard came in.

"Three porters are bringing up the whole bag of tricks," he said.

"Oh! Here are two hundred vrancs to bay for eferydings..." said Schmucke. "But, mein friend, your Montame Dobinard is ver' nice; you shall marry her, is it not so? I shall gif you tausend crowns, and die liddle vone shall haf tausend crowns for her toury, and you shall infest it in her name.... Und you are not to pe ein zuper any more—you are to pe de cashier at de teatre—"

"I?—instead of old Baudrand?"

"Yes."

"Who told you so?"

"Mennesir Gautissart!"

"Oh! it is enough to send one wild with joy!... Eh! I say, Rosalie, what a rumpus there will be at the theatre! But it is not possible—"

"Our benefactor must not live in a garret—"

"Pshaw! for die few tays dat I haf to lif it ees fery komfortable," said Schmucke. "Goot-pye; I am going to der zemetery, to see vat dey haf don mit Bons, und to order som flowers for his grafe."

Mme. Camusot de Marville was consumed by the liveliest apprehensions. At a council held with Fraisier, Berthier, and Godeschal, the two last-named authorities gave it as their opinion that it was hopeless to dispute a will drawn up by two notaries in the presence of two witnesses, so precisely was the instrument worded by Leopold Hannequin. Honest Godeschal said that even if Schmucke's own legal adviser should succeed in deceiving him, he would find out the truth at last, if it were only from some officious barrister, the gentlemen of the robe being wont to perform such acts of generosity and disinterestedness by way of self-advertisement. And the two officials took their leave of the Presidente with a parting caution against Fraisier, concerning whom they had naturally made inquiries. At that very moment Fraisier, straight from the affixing of the seals in the Rue de Normandie, was waiting for an interview with Mme. de Marville. Berthier and Godeschal had suggested that he should be shown into the study; the whole affair was too dirty for the President to look into (to use their own expression), and they wished to give Mme. de Marville their opinion in Fraisier's absence.

"Well, madame, where are these gentlemen?" asked Fraisier, admitted to audience.

"They are gone. They advise me to give up," said Mme. de Marville.

"Give up!" repeated Fraisier, suppressed fury in his voice. "Give up! Listen to this, madame:—

"'At the request of...' and so forth (I will omit the formalities)... 'Whereas there has been deposited in the hands of M. le President of the Court of First Instance, a will drawn up by Maitres Leopold Hannequin and Alexandre Crottat, notaries of Paris, and in the presence of two witnesses, the Sieurs Brunner and Schwab, aliens domiciled at Paris, and by the said will the Sieur Pons, deceased, has bequeathed his property to one Sieur Schmucke, a German, to the prejudice of his natural heirs. Whereas the applicant undertakes to prove that the said will was obtained under undue influence and by unlawful means; and persons of credit are prepared to show that it was the testator's intention to leave his fortune to Mlle. Cecile, daughter of the aforesaid Sieur de Marville, and the applicant can show that the said will was extorted from the testator's weakness, he being unaccountable for his actions at the time. Whereas as the Sieur Schmucke, to obtain a will in his favor, sequestrated the testator, and prevented the family from approaching the deceased during his last illness; and his subsequent notorious ingratitude was of a nature to scandalize the house and residents in the quarter who chanced to witness it when attending the funeral of the porter at the testator's place of abode. Whereas as still more serious charges, of which applicant is collecting proofs, will be formally made before their worships the judges. I, the undersigned Registrar of the Court, etc., etc., on behalf of the aforesaid, etc., have summoned the Sieur Schmucke, pleading, etc., to appear before their worships the judges of the first chamber of the Tribunal, and to be present when application is made that the will received by Maitres Hannequin and Crottat, being evidently obtained by undue influence, shall be regarded as null and void in law; and I, the undersigned, on behalf of the aforesaid, etc., have likewise given notice of protest, should the Sieur Schmucke as universal legatee make application for an order to be put into possession of the estate, seeing that the applicant opposes such order, and makes objection by his application bearing date of to-day, of which a copy has been duly deposited with the Sieur Schmucke, costs being charged to... etc., etc.'

"I know the man, Mme. le Presidente. He will come to terms as soon as he reads this little love-letter. He will take our terms. Are you going to give the thousand crowns per annum?"

"Certainly. I only wish I were paying the first installment now."

"It will be done in three days. The summons will come down upon him while he is stupefied with grief, for the poor soul regrets Pons and is taking the death to heart."

"Can the application be withdrawn?" inquired the lady.

"Certainly, madame. You can withdraw it at any time."

"Very well, monsieur, let it be so... go on! Yes, the purchase of land that you have arranged for me is worth the trouble; and, besides, I have managed Vitel's business—he is to retire, and you must pay Vitel's sixty thousand francs out of Pons' property. So, you see, you must succeed."

"Have you Vitel's resignation?"

"Yes, monsieur. M. Vitel has put himself in M. de Marville's hands."

"Very good, madame. I have already saved you sixty thousand francs which I expected to give to that vile creature Mme. Cibot. But I still require the tobacconist's license for the woman Sauvage, and an appointment to the vacant place of head-physician at the Quinze-Vingts for my friend Poulain."

"Agreed—it is all arranged."

"Very well. There is no more to be said. Every one is for you in this business, even Gaudissart, the manager of the theatre. I went to look him up yesterday, and he undertook to crush the workman who seemed likely to give us trouble."

"Oh, I know M. Gaudissart is devoted to the Popinots."

Fraisier went out. Unluckily, he missed Gaudissart, and the fatal summons was served forthwith.

If all covetous minds will sympathize with the Presidente, all honest folk will turn in abhorrence from her joy when Gaudissart came twenty minutes later to report his conversation with poor Schmucke. She gave her full approval; she was obliged beyond all expression for the thoughtful way in which the manager relieved her of any remaining scruples by observations which seemed to her to be very sensible and just.

"I thought as I came, Mme. la Presidente, that the poor devil would not know what to do with the money. 'Tis a patriarchally simple nature. He is a child, he is a German, he ought to be stuffed and put in a glass case like a waxen image. Which is to say that, in my opinion, he is quite puzzled enough already with his income of two thousand five hundred francs, and here you are provoking him into extravagance—"

"It is very generous of him to wish to enrich the poor fellow who regrets the loss of our cousin," pronounced the Presidente. "For my own part, I am sorry for the little squabble that estranged M. Pons and me. If he had come back again, all would have been forgiven. If you only knew how my husband misses him! M. de Marville received no notice of the death, and was in despair; family claims are sacred for him, he would have gone to the service and the interment, and I myself would have been at the mass—"

"Very well, fair lady," said Gaudissart. "Be so good as to have the documents drawn up, and at four o'clock I will bring this German to you. Please remember me to your charming daughter the Vicomtesse, and ask her to tell my illustrious friend the great statesman, her good and excellent father-in-law, how deeply I am devoted to him and his, and ask him to continue his valued favors. I owe my life to his uncle the judge, and my success in life to him; and I should wish to be bound to both you and your daughter by the high esteem which links us with persons of rank and influence. I wish to leave the theatre and become a serious person."

"As you are already, monsieur!" said the Presidente.

"Adorable!" returned Gaudissart, kissing the lady's shriveled fingers.





CONCLUSION


At four o'clock that afternoon several people were gathered together at Berthier's office; Fraisier, arch-concocter of the whole scheme, Tabareau, appearing on behalf of Schmucke, and Schmucke himself. Gaudissart had come with him. Fraisier had been careful to spread out the money on Berthier's desk, and so dazzled was Schmucke by the sight of the six thousand-franc bank-notes for which he had asked, and six hundred francs for the first quarter's allowance, that he paid no heed whatsoever to the reading of the document. Poor man, he was scarcely in full possession of his faculties, shaken as they had already been by so many shocks. Gaudissart had snatched him up on his return from the cemetery, where he had been talking with Pons, promising to join him soon—very soon. So Schmucke did not listen to the preamble in which it was set forth that Maitre Tabareau, bailiff, was acting as his proxy, and that the Presidente, in the interests of her daughter, was taking legal proceedings against him. Altogether, in that preamble the German played a sorry part, but he put his name to the document, and thereby admitted the truth of Fraisier's abominable allegations; and so joyous was he over receiving the money for the Topinards, so glad to bestow wealth according to his little ideas upon the one creature who loved Pons, that he heard not a word of lawsuit nor compromise.

But in the middle of the reading a clerk came into the private office to speak to his employer. "There is a man here, sir, who wishes to speak to M. Schmucke," said he.

The notary looked at Fraisier, and, taking his cue from him, shrugged his shoulders.

"Never disturb us when we are signing documents. Just ask his name—is it a man or a gentleman? Is he a creditor?"

The clerk went and returned. "He insists that he must speak to M.Schmucke."

"His name?"

"His name is Topinard, he says."

"I will go out to him. Sign without disturbing yourself," said Gaudissart, addressing Schmucke. "Make an end of it; I will find out what he wants with us."

Gaudissart understood Fraisier; both scented danger.

"Why are you here?" Gaudissart began. "So you have no mind to be cashier at the theatre? Discretion is a cashier's first recommendation."

"Sir—"

"Just mind your own business; you will never be anything if you meddle in other people's affairs."

"Sir, I cannot eat bread if every mouthful of it is to stick in my throat.... Monsieur Schmucke!—M. Schmucke!" he shouted aloud.

Schmucke came out at the sound of Topinard's voice. He had just signed. He held the money in his hand.

"Thees ees for die liddle German maiden und for you," he said.

"Oh! my dear M. Schmucke, you have given away your wealth to inhuman wretches, to people who are trying to take away your good name. I took this paper to a good man, an attorney who knows this Fraisier, and he says that you ought to punish such wickedness; you ought to let them summon you and leave them to get out of it.—Read this," and Schmucke's imprudent friend held out the summons delivered in the Cite Bordin.

Standing in the notary's gateway, Schmucke read the document, saw the imputations made against him, and, all ignorant as he was of the amenities of the law, the blow was deadly. The little grain of sand stopped his heart's beating. Topinard caught him in his arms, hailed a passing cab, and put the poor German into it. He was suffering from congestion of the brain; his eyes were dim, his head was throbbing, but he had enough strength left to put the money into Topinard's hands. Schmucke rallied from the first attack, but he never recovered consciousness, and refused to eat. Ten days afterwards he died without a complaint; to the last he had not spoken a word. Mme. Topinard nursed him, and Topinard laid him by Pons' side. It was an obscure funeral; Topinard was the only mourner who followed the son of Germany to his last resting-place.

Fraisier, now a justice of the peace, is very intimate with the President's family, and much valued by the Presidente. She could not think of allowing him to marry "that girl of Tabareau's," and promised infinitely better things for the clever man to whom she considers she owes not merely the pasture-land and the English cottage at Marville, but also the President's seat in the Chamber of Deputies, for M. le President was returned at the general election in 1846.

Every one, no doubt, wishes to know what became of the heroine of a story only too veracious in its details; a chronicle which, taken with its twin sister the preceding volume,La Cousine Bette, proves that Character is a great social force. You, O amateurs, connoisseurs, and dealers, will guess at once that Pons' collection is now in question. Wherefore it will suffice if we are present during a conversation that took place only a few days ago in Count Popinot's house. He was showing his splendid collection to some visitors.

"M. le Comte, you possess treasures indeed," remarked a distinguished foreigner.

"Oh! as to pictures, nobody can hope to rival an obscure collector, one Elie Magus, a Jew, an old monomaniac, the prince of picture-lovers," the Count replied modestly. "And when I say nobody, I do not speak of Paris only, but of all Europe. When the old Croesus dies, France ought to spare seven or eight millions of francs to buy the gallery. For curiosities, my collection is good enough to be talked about—"

"But how, busy as you are, and with a fortune so honestly earned in the first instance in business—"

"In the drug business," broke in Popinot; "you ask how I can continue to interest myself in things that are a drug in the market—"

"No," returned the foreign visitor, "no, but how do you find time to collect? The curiosities do not come to find you."

"My father-in-law owned the nucleus of the collection," said the young Vicomtess; "he loved the arts and beautiful work, but most of his treasures came to him through me."

"Through you, madame?—So young! and yet have you such vices as this?" asked a Russian prince.

Russians are by nature imitative; imitative indeed to such an extent that the diseases of civilization break out among them in epidemics. The bric-a-brac mania had appeared in an acute form in St. Petersburg, and the Russians caused such a rise of prices in the "art line," as Remonencq would say, that collection became impossible. The prince who spoke had come to Paris solely to buy bric-a-brac.

"The treasures came to me, prince, on the death of a cousin. He was very fond of me," added the Vicomtesse Popinot, "and he had spent some forty odd years since 1805 in picking up these masterpieces everywhere, but more especially in Italy—"

"And what was his name?" inquired the English lord.

"Pons," said President Camusot.

"A charming man he was," piped the Presidente in her thin, flute tones, "very clever, very eccentric, and yet very good-hearted. This fan that you admire once belonged to Mme. de Pompadour; he gave it to me one morning with a pretty speech which you must permit me not to repeat," and she glanced at her daughter.

"Mme. la Vicomtesse, tell us the pretty speech," begged the Russian prince.

"The speech was as pretty as the fan," returned the Vicomtesse, who brought out the stereotyped remark on all occasions. "He told my mother that it was quite time that it should pass from the hands of vice into those of virtue."

The English lord looked at Mme. Camusot de Marville with an air of doubt not a little gratifying to so withered a woman.

"He used to dine at our house two or three times a week," she said; "he was so fond of us! We could appreciate him, and artists like the society of those who relish their wit. My husband was, besides, his one surviving relative. So when, quite unexpectedly, M. de Marville came into the property, M. le Comte preferred to take over the whole collection to save it from a sale by auction; and we ourselves much preferred to dispose of it in that way, for it would have been so painful to us to see the beautiful things, in which our dear cousin was so much interested, all scattered abroad. Elie Magus valued them, and in that way I became possessed of the cottage that your uncle built, and I hope you will do us the honor of coming to see us there."

Gaudissart's theatre passed into other hands a year ago, but M. Topinard is still the cashier. M. Topinard, however, has grown gloomy and misanthropic; he says little. People think that he has something on his conscience. Wags at the theatre suggest that his gloom dates from his marriage with Lolotte. Honest Topinard starts whenever he hears Fraisier's name mentioned. Some people may think it strange that the one nature worthy of Pons and Schmucke should be found on the third floor beneath the stage of a boulevard theatre.

Mme. Remonencq, much impressed with Mme. Fontaine's prediction, declines to retire to the country. She is still living in her splendid shop on the Boulevard de la Madeleine, but she is a widow now for the second time. Remonencq, in fact, by the terms of the marriage contract, settled the property upon the survivor, and left a little glass of vitriol about for his wife to drink by mistake; but his wife, with the very best intentions, put the glass elsewhere, and Remonencq swallowed the draught himself. The rascal's appropriate end vindicates Providence, as well as the chronicler of manners, who is sometimes accused of neglect on this head, perhaps because Providence has been so overworked by playwrights of late.
