怪医杜立德英文版







译者序


《怪医杜立德》是著名儿童作家休·洛夫廷（Hugh　Lofting，1886—1947）的天才之作，是真正的儿童典范读物。

休·洛夫廷出生在英国伯克郡的梅登黑德，1912年和一位美国女子结婚，婚后定居美国纽约。“一战”期间他曾服兵役。在战场上，他看到人受伤会得到救治，马则被枪杀。洛夫廷认为马也应有医生为它们救治。于是，他想塑造一个住在英国乡村、能听懂动物语言、能给动物治病的善良医生的形象。1919年，洛夫廷负伤回家，在妻子的鼓励下开始文学创作。1920年，他的《怪医杜立德》问世，广受读者欢迎。1922年，洛夫廷又出版了《杜立德医生航海记》，并获得了1923年纽伯瑞儿童文学奖。

《怪医杜立德》讲的是医学博士杜立德在家乡的离奇生活和在海外的历险经历。杜博士本来是一位给人看病的医生，但是，由于他非常喜爱动物，满屋子都是各种动物，因此吓跑了所有的病人。恰逢此时，鹦鹉波利尼西亚教会了他鸟兽语。于是，他专门给动物们看起了病。动物们口耳相传，纷纷来找他看病。甚至连非洲猴子国发生传染病，也不远万里来请他出诊。这样，心地善良的杜立德医生便开始了惊心动魄、扣人心弦的非洲之旅。

《怪医杜立德》神奇自然，引人入胜：猫头鹰的听觉，狗的嗅觉，鹰的视觉，海豚的灵性，鼠的预感……《怪医杜立德》跨越成人间的疆界，将善良的心地拓展到每个角落，使善良成为一种美德。如果我们在生活中也像杜博士那样尊重他人，付出挚爱，那么，整个世界就会充满爱的气息和幸福的味道。





第一章　泥塘镇


好多好多年以前，也就是我们的爷爷小的时候，有一位医生，名叫杜立德——约翰·杜立德，医学博士。“医学博士”意味着他是一位名副其实的医生，而且无所不知。

他住在一个小镇上，小镇名叫“沼泽地的泥塘镇”。所有碰见他的人，无论老少，没有不认识他的。每当他戴着高高的礼帽走在街上时，人们总会说：“医生来了！他是一个能人。”而街上的狗和孩子也都跑来跟在他的后面，甚至连那些住在教堂塔楼上的乌鸦也常常嘎嘎叫上几声，点点头。

他住的房子在小镇边上，相当小，但是他的花园很大，有一片宽阔的草坪，有石凳，还有依依垂柳。他的妹妹莎拉·杜立德，为他料理家务，但是医生会亲自打理花园。

他非常喜爱动物，养了好多种宠物。除了花园深处池塘里的金鱼之外，他还在餐具室里养了兔子，在钢琴里养了一窝小白鼠，在放日用纺织品的壁橱里养了一只松鼠，在地窖里养了一只刺猬。他还有一头带小牛犊的母牛、一匹已经二十五岁的老瘸马，还有鸡、鸽子、两只羊羔，以及许多其他的动物。不过，他最喜爱的宠物是鸭子嘎嘎、小狗吉普、小猪珈珈、鹦鹉波利尼西亚和猫头鹰秃秃。

他的妹妹过去经常抱怨所有这些动物，说它们把家里搞得乱七八糟。有一天，一个患风湿病的老太太来看病，一下子坐在了那只正在沙发上睡觉的刺猬身上，从此她再也没有来找杜医生看过病，而是每个星期六驱车十英里，到奥克森索普镇去找另一位医生看病。

过后，他的妹妹莎拉·杜立德前来对他说：“约翰，你在家里养这些动物，怎么能指望病人来找你看病呢？你以为好医生都是在客厅里养满刺猬和老鼠吧！这已经是动物们吓跑的第四位病人了。乡绅詹金斯和牧师都纷纷说，无论病得多么厉害，他们也绝不会靠近你的房子了。我们一天比一天穷了。你要是再这样下去，再好的人也不会让你看病的。”

“可是，我喜欢动物，胜过那些‘再好的人’。”医生说。

“你真可笑。”他的妹妹说着，走出了房间。

于是，随着时间的推移，医生得到的动物越来越多了，而来找他看病的人却越来越少了。到了最后，他连一个病人也没有留住，除了一个卖猫食的，因为这个人对任何动物都不在乎。可是，卖猫食的并不是很富有，而且每年只病一次，就是圣诞节时他会付给医生六便士，买一瓶药。

每年六便士可不够生活，即使在很久以前的那些日子也不够；要不是医生在存钱箱里存了一些钱，谁也不知道会发生什么情况。

而且，他还接着弄回家更多的宠物，当然，养这些宠物开销很大。他存的钱越来越少了。

后来，他变卖了钢琴，让那些小白鼠住在写字台的一只抽屉里。可是，卖钢琴的钱也渐渐地少了。于是，他又卖了自己礼拜日穿的那身褐色礼服，变得越来越穷了。

如今，每当他戴着高高的礼帽出现在街头时，人们常常会说：“医学博士约翰·杜立德来了！他曾是英格兰西部地区最有名的医生——瞧他现在——他连一分钱都没有了，长袜子上到处都是窟窿！”

可是，那些狗、猫和孩子仍会跑上去，跟着他穿过小镇，活像他有钱时那样。





第二章　动物语言


一天，杜立德医生正坐在厨房里和那个卖猫食的聊天，卖猫食的是来找他看胃痛的。

“你为什么不放弃给人当医生，改做动物医生呢？”卖猫食的问道。

鹦鹉波利尼西亚卧在窗户上，一边望着外面的雨，一边独自唱着一首水手歌。这时，它停住歌声，倾听起来。

“你明白，医生，”卖猫食的接着说道，“你对动物了如指掌，比这儿所有的兽医都懂得多得多。你写的那本猫的书，哇，可真棒！我自己既不会读也不会写，不然，我说不定也会写几本书呢。不过，我的妻子西奥多西亚，她可是有学问的，真的。她给我念了你的书。哎呀，真棒啊，只能这样说了——真棒。仿佛你自己过去就是一只猫似的。你明白它们的想法。听我说，你给动物看病会挣好多钱。你知道吗？你明白，我会让所有有病猫病狗的老太太都上你这儿来。要是这些猫狗病得不够快，我可以在卖给它们的肉里加点儿东西，让它们生病，明白吗？”

“噢，不，”医生马上说道，“你别那样做。那样做不对。”

“噢，我不是说真生病，”卖猫食的回答说，“我是说，就加一点儿东西，让它们无精打采。不过，正如你所说的那样，那可能对动物们很不公平。可是，不管怎样，它们都会生病，因为那些老太太总是给它们吃得太多。另外，还有周围那些家里有瘸马瘦羔的农夫，他们也会来找你的。当动物医生吧。”

等卖猫食的走后，鹦鹉飞下窗户，落到医生的桌子上说：“那个人有见识。你应该那样做。当动物医生吧。如果那些蠢人没有头脑，看不出你是世界上最好的医生，你就别再管他们了。去照看动物们吧，他们马上就会发现你是世界上最好的医生。当动物医生吧。”

“噢，动物医生有好多了。”说着，杜立德医生把花盆移到外面的窗台上淋些雨。

“是的，是有好多，”波利尼西亚说，“可是，他们根本不怎么样。听我说，医生，我来告诉你一件事儿。你过去知道动物会说话吗？”

“我知道鹦鹉会说话。”医生说。

“噢，我们鹦鹉能说两种语言：人语和鸟语。”波利尼西亚自豪地说，“如果我说：‘波利想吃饼干，’你就会明白我的意思。不过，你听听这个：卡─卡，噢─矣，菲─菲？”

“天哪！”医生嚷道，“那是什么意思？”

“意思是说：‘粥热了吗？’”

“哎呀！不会吧！”医生说，“你以前可从来没有对我这样说过啊。”

“有什么用啊？”说着，波利尼西亚拂去了左翅上的一些饼干屑，“就是我说了，你也不明白我的意思。”

“再对我说一些吧。”医生非常激动。他快步冲到碗柜抽屉跟前，拿来了肉店的账本和一支铅笔。“别说太快了，我要记下来。这很有趣，有趣极了，太新鲜了。先教我鸟语的基础知识，慢点儿。”

就这样，医生渐渐地知道了动物们都有自己的语言，而且能相互交谈。整个下午，天一直下着雨，波利尼西亚卧在餐桌上教他鸟词，让他记在本子上。

喝下午茶时，小狗吉普走了进来，鹦鹉对医生说：“瞧，它在对你说话。”

“在我看来，它好像是在挠耳朵吧。”医生说。

“可是，动物们并不总是用嘴巴说话，”鹦鹉扬了扬眉，高声说道，“它们用耳朵，用爪子，用尾巴，用所有的一切说话。有时，它们不想发出声音。你看见它在向上抽动一边的鼻子了吗？”

“那是什么意思？”医生问道。

“那是说：‘难道你没有瞧见雨已经停了吗？’”波利尼西亚回答说，“它是在向你询问。狗差不多总是用鼻子问问题。”

在鹦鹉的帮助下，医生不久便学会了动物语言，完全可以独自跟它们交谈，还能听懂它们说的所有的话。于是，他就彻底放弃了给人当医生。

卖猫食的一告诉大家约翰·杜立德要当动物医生，老太太们就往他这儿送起了她们那些蛋糕吃得太多的哈巴狗、狮子狗；农夫们也从好几英里以外赶来，让他看自家的病牛、病羊。

一天，一匹犁地的马被送到了他这儿。这个可怜的东西非常高兴自己终于碰到了一个会说马语的医生。

“你知道，医生，”马说，“山上的那个兽医一无所知。他到现在已经给我的跗节内肿治疗了六个星期。我需要的是一副眼镜。我的一只眼睛快要瞎了。为什么马不应该像人那样戴眼镜呢？毫无道理嘛！可是，山上的那个笨蛋甚至从来没有看过我的眼睛。他一直给我吃大药片。我曾试图告诉他，可是他对马语一窍不通。我需要的是一副眼镜。”

“当然，当然，”医生说，“我马上给你配一副。”

“我想要一副你这样的眼镜，”马说，“只不过要绿的。我犁那五十英亩地时，绿眼镜能帮我遮阳呢。”

“当然，”医生说，“你应该戴一副绿眼镜。”

“先生，你知道，问题是，”医生打开前门要送那匹犁马出去时，马又说道，“问题是，人人都以为自己能给动物看病，只是因为动物们不发牢骚。事实上，跟当一个好的人医相比，当一个真正的好兽医，需要人要聪明得多。我那个农夫的儿子以为他对马了如指掌。我希望你能看到他，他的脸胖得看上去就像没有眼睛似的，脑袋像薯虫那样大。上星期，他一心想往我身上抹芥子膏。”

“最终抹哪儿了？”医生问道。

“噢，哪儿也没有抹到，”马说，“他只是想那样干。我一下子就把他踢进了鸭塘。”

“好，好！”医生说。

“我通常都很安静，”马说，“对人很有耐心，不会大惊小怪。可是，那个兽医给我吃错了药，这就够我受的了。这个红脸笨蛋还来戏弄我，我再也忍不下去了。”

“你把那个男孩伤得厉害吗？”医生问道。

“噢，不厉害，”马说，“我踢得恰到好处。现在那个兽医正在照看他。我的眼镜什么时候配好啊？”

“下星期就会为你配好，”医生说，“你下星期二再来吧——再见！”

于是，约翰·杜立德搞了一副漂亮的大绿眼镜。那匹犁马的一只眼睛再也不会瞎了，可以像过去那样看见东西了。

不久，泥塘镇周边的村子里，经常可以看到一些干农活的动物戴着眼镜。从此，瞎马就销声匿迹了。

因此，那些被带到他这儿来的其他动物也一样。它们一发现医生会说它们的语言，就告诉他哪儿疼，感觉怎样。当然，这样他就能轻而易举地治好它们的病了。

现在所有就诊的动物回去后，都告诉自己的兄弟朋友，在那个带有大花园的小房子里有一位医生，他是一位真正的医生。从此，无论什么动物什么时候生病，不仅仅马、牛和狗，甚至连田野里的小动物，比如像巢鼠、麝香鼠、獾和蝙蝠，都会立马来到他位于镇边的家里，这样一来，他的大花园差不多总是挤满了想进去找他看病的动物。

因为要来的动物有好多，所以他只好为不同种类的动物专门设了各种门。他在前门上写着“马”，在侧门上写着“牛”，在厨房门上写着“羊”。每种动物都有一个单独的门——他甚至还为那些老鼠挖了一条小小的通道通向地窖，它们在那儿排成一行一行的，耐心等待医生过来给它们看病。

这样，没过几年，方圆好多英里的每一种生物都渐渐地知道了医学博士约翰·杜立德。冬天那些飞到其他国家去的鸟儿们把沼泽地的泥塘镇的这位神医的故事告诉了外国动物，说他能听懂它们说话，帮助它们治病。这样，他在全世界的动物中就渐渐地有了名气，比他给人当医生时在英格兰西部地区还有名气。所以，他开心极了，非常喜欢自己的生活。

一天下午，医生正忙着写东西，波利尼西亚卧在窗户上，它平时基本上总是这样，望着花园里被风吹来吹去的落叶。不一会儿，它大笑了起来。

“怎么了，波利尼西亚？”医生从书稿上抬起头来问道。

“我只是在思考。”说着，鹦鹉又看起了那些落叶。

“在思考什么？”

“我在思考有关人的事儿，”波利尼西亚说，“人让我讨厌。他们以为自己很了不起。这个世界一直运行了几千年，不是吗？人领会的唯一的动物语言就是狗摇尾巴时意味着它说‘我很高兴！’真有趣，不是吗？你是第一个会像我们一样说话的人。噢，有时人真让我生气，瞧他们谈论‘那些不会说话的动物’时趾高气扬的样子。不会说话！哼！哎，我曾认识一只金刚鹦鹉，它不用张嘴，就能用七种不同方式说‘早安’。它会说各种语言，包括希腊语。一位花白胡子的老教授买下了它。可是，它待不下去。它说那个老人说的希腊语不地道，它无法忍受听他用错误的发音教学生。我常常在想，也不知道它现在怎么样了。那只鸟知道的地理知识比人知道的还要多。——人，天哪！我想，人要是学会了飞——像任何一只普通的篱雀那样，那我们受到的纠缠就会没完没了！”

“你是一只聪明的老鸟，”医生说，“你到底有多大了？我知道鹦鹉和大象有时会活到很老很老。”

“我对自己的年龄从来都拿不准，”波利尼西亚说，“要么是一百八十三岁，要么是一百八十二岁。不过，我知道刚从非洲来到这儿时，查理国王还藏在橡树上，因为我看见他了。看上去他吓得要死。”





第三章　更多的金钱困难


不久，医生又开始挣钱了；他的妹妹莎拉·杜立德买了一条新裙子，很开心。有些来就诊的动物病得很重，只好在医生家里住一星期。渐渐好些后，它们常常坐在草坪的椅子上。

甚至康复后，它们也总是不愿离开，因为它们十分喜欢医生和他的家。当它们问是不是能跟医生待在一起时，他从来都不忍心拒绝它们。就这样，他的宠物越来越多了。

一天傍晚，他正坐在花园墙上抽烟斗，一个意大利手风琴艺人牵着一只猴子走了过来。医生马上就看出来，猴子的项圈太紧了，而且猴子脏兮兮的，闷闷不乐。于是，他从意大利人手里一把夺过猴子，给了那个人一先令，让他走人。手风琴艺人非常生气，说他不想卖猴子。可是，医生告诉他说，他要是不走开，就砸烂他的鼻子。尽管约翰·杜立德个子不高，但是身强力壮。于是，意大利人就骂骂咧咧地走了，那只猴子便留在了杜立德医生身边，有了一个安定的家。家里的其他动物都叫它“奇奇”——这在猴语里是一个常用词，是“活力”的意思。

还有一次，马戏团来泥塘镇演出，一条鳄鱼牙疼得厉害，半夜逃跑，钻进了医生的花园。医生和它用鳄语交谈，并把它带进了屋里，治好了它的牙疼。可是，当鳄鱼看到那是一个多么舒适的家，各种动物都在各自的窝里时，它也想跟医生住在一起。它请求说，它要是保证不吃鱼，能不能让它住在花园深处的鱼塘里。马戏团的人要带它回去，它一下子变得是那样疯狂野蛮，把他们都吓跑了。可是，对这家里的每个成员，它总是像小猫一样温顺。

但是现在，因为家里有了鳄鱼，老太太们不敢把她们的哈巴狗送到这儿来看病了，那些农夫相信鳄鱼会吃掉他们送来治疗的羊羔和小病牛。于是，医生对鳄鱼说，他必须回马戏团。可是，鳄鱼哭了，流下了大颗大颗的眼泪，苦苦哀求医生允许它留下来，医生不忍心把它赶走。

于是，他的妹妹走上前对医生说：“约翰，你必须赶走那只动物。现在农夫们和老太太们都害怕把他们的动物送到这儿看病，我们的日子眼看就要重新好起来了。现在我们会被完全毁掉的。这是压死骆驼的最后一根稻草。你要是不赶走那条美洲鳄，我就再也不给你管家了。”

“它不是美洲鳄，”医生说，“而是非洲鳄。”

“我不在乎你叫它什么。”他的妹妹说，“看到它趴在床底下真让人讨厌。我不允许它留在家里。”

“可是，它已经向我保证过了，”医生回答说，“它不会咬任何东西。它不喜欢马戏团，而我又没有钱把它送回非洲老家去。它不管闲事，总的看来非常规矩。你不要大惊小怪。”

“我告诉你，我绝不容忍它待在这儿。”莎拉说，“它还吃油毡。你要是此刻不把它赶走，我就——我就嫁人去！”

“好啊，”医生说，“那就嫁人去吧。这是无可奈何的事儿。”说完，他摘下帽子，走出去，进了花园。

于是，莎拉·杜立德打点东西后就走了。留下医生独自和他的动物家族待在一起。

没过多久，他变得比以前任何时候都穷了。有那么多张嘴等着吃，房子也需要照看，缝缝补补没有人手，也没有钱来支付肉店的账单了，情况看起来非常艰难。可是，医生一点儿也不担心。

“钱是个讨厌的东西，”他常常说，“要是从来都没有发明钱，我们就一定会过得更幸福。只要我们开心，钱算什么？”

可是，不久，那些动物就开始担心起来了。一天傍晚，医生坐在厨房火边睡着了。它们聚在一起低声商量起来。擅长算术的猫头鹰秃秃算出来，即使它们每天只吃一顿饭，剩下的钱也只够维持一星期了。

这时，鹦鹉说：“我想我们都应该亲自做家务，至少我们可以做那么多。毕竟，老人是因为我们才这样孤独、这样贫穷的。”

于是，大家商定，猴子奇奇负责做饭和缝补，狗负责扫地，鸭子负责除尘、铺床，猫头鹰秃秃负责记账，小猪负责园艺。它们让鹦鹉波利尼西亚管家和洗衣服，因为它年纪最大。

当然，一开始它们都觉得新工作很难做——除了奇奇，因为它有手，可以像人一样做事。但是，不久，它们就习以为常了，而且每当看到小狗吉普在尾巴上绑一块破布当扫帚扫地，它们总觉得非常有趣。没过多久，它们就把家务做得井井有条了。医生说，家里以前从来没有这样整洁过。

就这样，情况好了一阵子，可是，没有钱，它们发现日子很难熬。

于是，那些动物在园门外摆了一个蔬菜鲜花货摊，向过往的路人出售萝卜和玫瑰。

不过，它们挣的钱好像还是不够付账单，而且医生仍然不着急。鹦鹉对医生说，鱼贩子不愿再送给他们鱼吃了。他说：“不要紧。只要母鸡下蛋、奶牛产奶，我们就会有煎蛋卷和奶酪。再说，花园里还剩有不少蔬菜。冬天还远着哩。别大惊小怪。莎拉就有这毛病，她总是大惊小怪。我不知道莎拉现在怎么样了，她非常出色——某些方面——唉，算了！”

可是，那年雪下得比平常早。老瘸马从镇外的森林里驮回了好多木柴，大家得以在厨房里生一大堆火，但是花园里的蔬菜大部分都吃光了，剩下的也都被雪覆盖着，动物们有不少都是饥肠辘辘的。





第四章　非洲传来消息


那是一个非常寒冷的冬天。十二月的一天夜里，它们围坐在厨房温暖的炉火边，医生正在给它们大声朗读他用动物语言写的书，这时猫头鹰秃秃突然说道：“嘘！外面是什么声音？”

大家全都侧耳倾听，不一会儿就听到了奔跑的声音。接着，门突然打开，只见猴子奇奇上气不接下气，跑了进来。

“医生！”它叫道，“我刚刚收到我的一个表兄从非洲传来的消息，说那儿的猴群中流行一种可怕的疾病。它们全都被感染了，成百上千的猴子正在奄奄一息。它们听说了你，恳求你到非洲去阻止这场疾病。”

“是谁带来的消息？”医生摘掉眼镜，放下书，问道。

“是一只燕子，”奇奇说，“它就在外面的集雨桶上。”

“把它带到火边来，”医生说，“它肯定被冻坏了。燕子们六个星期前就飞到南方去了！”

燕子被带了进来，冻得缩成了一团，正在瑟瑟发抖。起先，它有点儿害怕，很快就暖和了，于是就卧到壁炉台沿上，开始讲了起来。

它讲完后，医生说：“我非常乐意去非洲，尤其是在这样寒冷的天气下。可是，我担心我们没有足够的钱去买票。奇奇，去把存钱箱拿来。”

猴子爬上柜子，从顶架上把存钱箱拿了下来。

里面空空荡荡，一个子儿都没有了！

“我敢肯定还有两便士。”医生说。

“以前有。”猫头鹰说，“但是獾的小娃娃出牙时，你用那两便士给它买了一只拨浪鼓。”

“是吗？”医生说，“噢，哎呀！真是的，钱是一个多么讨厌的东西！噢，别担心。也许我可以去海边借条船，这样我们就可以去非洲了。我以前认识一位水手，他带小孩来我这儿看过麻疹。也许他会把船借给我们，因为他小孩的病好了。”

于是，第二天一早，医生就去了海边。回来时，他告诉动物们，没问题，那位水手愿意把船借给他们。

鳄鱼、猴子和鹦鹉听了，都非常高兴，不禁唱起了歌，因为它们要回非洲了，那是它们真正的家乡。

医生说：“我只能带上你们仨，加上小狗吉普、鸭子嘎嘎、小猪珈珈和猫头鹰秃秃。剩下的，像睡鼠、麝香鼠和蝙蝠，它们必须回到出生的田间，直到我们再回到家来。不过，因为它们中的大多数都冬眠，所以对此都不介意。再说，去非洲对它们也不是什么好事儿。”

以前有过多次远洋航行经验的鹦鹉叮嘱医生上船务必携带的所有东西。

“务必带上充足的硬饼干，”它说，“也就是人们所谓的‘压缩饼干’。还必须带上罐装牛肉和一只锚。”

“我料想船上会有船锚。”医生说。

“啊，要确定，”波利尼西亚说，“因为这很重要。要是没有锚，船就停不下来。还需要一只铃铛。”

“要那干什么？”医生问道。

“靠它来计时。”鹦鹉说，“每半小时摇一次铃，这样你就知道几点钟了。还要带好多好多的绳子，海上航行绳子总是能派上用场的。”

然后，它们就开始琢磨到哪儿弄钱去买所有这些必需的东西。

“噢，讨厌！又是钱！”医生叫道，“天哪！我很高兴去非洲。到了那儿，我们就什么也不需要了！我去问问杂货店老板，看他是否愿意等到我们回来时再还他钱。不，得让水手去问他。”

水手去见了杂货店老板。不一会儿，他就带着他们想要的所有东西回来了。

接着，动物们就打点行装。它们关掉水，这样那些管子就不会结冰了，然后合上百叶窗，关上房门，把钥匙交给了住在马厩的老马。看到阁楼里有不少干草足够老马越冬后，它们便带着所有的行李前往海边，登上了那条船。

卖猫食的在那儿为他们送行。他还带了一块板油布丁，作为礼物送给医生，因为他听说在国外吃不到板油布丁。

他们一上船，小猪珈珈就问床在什么地方，因为现在是下午四点钟，它想打个盹儿。波利尼西亚把它带到了下面的船舱，但见那些床全都靠墙一个叠一个，像书架似的。

“哎呀，那不是床！”珈珈叫道，“那是架子！”

“船上的床就是这样。”鹦鹉说，“那不是架子。爬进去睡吧。这就是你所说的‘睡铺’。”

“我还不想上床。”珈珈说，“我太兴奋了。我想再上去，看他们起航。”

“好，这是你第一次航行。”波利尼西亚说，“不久，你就会习惯这种生活了。”

说完，它沿着船梯又回到了上面，独自哼唱起了这首歌：

我见过了黑海和红海；

我绕过了白岛；

我发现了黄河，

夜间还发现了橙河。

现在，绿色之乡又落在了后面，

我驶向蔚蓝色的海洋。

简，我厌倦了所有这些色彩，

我要回到你身边。

正要起航，医生说他得回去问问水手去非洲该怎么走。

可是，燕子说它去过那个地方好多次了，它愿意给他们指引航线。

听了这话，医生吩咐奇奇起锚。航行开始了。





第五章　伟大的航行


整整六个星期，他们一直在波涛起伏的大海上航行。燕子在船前飞行，给他们领路。到了夜里，它就提着一只小灯笼，以免他们在黑暗中找不到它。过往船只上的人们都说那道光肯定是一颗流星。

他们渐行渐远，来到了南方，天气变得越来越暖和。波利尼西亚、奇奇和鳄鱼都非常喜欢烈日。它们欢笑着跑来跑去，不时地到船边眺望一下，看是不是能看到非洲。

小猪、小狗和猫头鹰秃秃却对这种天气无可奈何，只能卧在船头一只大桶的阴影下，伸出舌头，喝柠檬水。

鸭子嘎嘎常常跳进海水里，游到船后面纳凉。每当感觉头顶太热时，它就潜到船下，从另一边钻出来。每到星期二和星期五，它还用这种方式逮青鱼。每当这时，船上的每个人和动物都吃鱼，好节省一些牛肉。

接近赤道时，他们看到一些飞鱼朝他们游了过来。飞鱼问鹦鹉，这是不是杜立德医生的船。鹦鹉告诉它们说正是。它们说真高兴，因为非洲的那些猴子正心急火燎，以为医生永远不会来了呢。波利尼西亚问它们还要走多少英里。飞鱼们说，现在离非洲海岸只有五十五英里了。

还有一次，一大群鼠海豚穿波越浪，纷纷游了过来。它们也问波利尼西亚，这是不是那位名医的船。一听说是，它们就问鹦鹉，医生旅程中需不需要什么东西。

波利尼西亚说：“需要。我们的洋葱吃完了。”

“离这儿不远有一座岛，”鼠海豚们说，“那儿的野葱长得又高又壮。你们继续前进，我们去弄些洋葱，然后再追赶你们。”

说完，鼠海豚们飞速地穿浪而去。不大一会儿，鹦鹉又看见它们正穿波越浪从后面追了上来，身后拖着几个海草做的、装满洋葱的大网。

第二天傍晚，太阳快下山时，医生说：“奇奇，把望远镜拿来。我们的航程就要结束了。很快，我们就能看到非洲海岸了。”

大约半小时后，果然，他们好像看到了前方有个类似陆地的东西。可是，天色越来越暗了，他们拿不准。

随后，一场暴风雨接踵而来，电闪雷鸣，狂风呼啸，大雨倾盆，海浪滔天，飞溅在了船上。

紧接着，的一声巨响！船停住了，朝一侧翻去。

“发生了什么事儿？”医生从船舱里跑上来问道。

“我拿不准，”鹦鹉说，“不过，我想，我们的船出事了。让鸭子下去看看吧。”

于是，嘎嘎潜到海浪下面，然后上来说，他们撞上了一块岩石，船底有一个大洞，海水正往里面涌，他们在迅速下沉。

“我们肯定是撞上了非洲大陆。”医生说，“哎呀，好家伙！噢，我们必须全都游到陆地上去。”

可是，奇奇和珈珈都不会游泳。

“拿绳子来！”波利尼西亚说，“我说过，绳子迟早用得上。鸭子哪儿去了？嘎嘎，过来。你拽着绳子这一头，飞上岸去，把它拴到一棵棕榈树上；我们在船上抓紧绳子的另一头。然后，那些不会游泳的可以顺着绳子爬到陆地上去。这就是人们所谓的‘救生索’。”

最终，他们全都安全上岸，有的是游过来的，有的是飞过来的；那些顺绳子爬过来的还把医生的行李箱和手提包带了过来。

可是，船再也不能用了，因为船底有一个大洞。不久，凶猛的海浪便把船在岩石上摔得粉碎，船骨也顺水漂走了。

他们在悬崖高处找了一个干爽的洞穴，躲了进去，直到暴风雨过去。

第二天早上，太阳出来了。他们来到沙滩上，让太阳把身子晒干。

“亲爱的老非洲，”波利尼西亚感叹道，“回来真好！请想一下吧——明天就是我离开它一百六十九年了！它一点儿都没有变！同样的棕榈树，同样的红土地，同样的黑蚂蚁！还是家乡好啊！”

动物们注意到，鹦鹉热泪盈眶。再次看到了故乡，它真是太高兴了。

这时，医生想起了自己的高帽，暴风雨中它被刮到了海里。嘎嘎下水去找。不一会儿，它就远远地看到了帽子，只见帽子像玩具船一样正漂在水上。

它飞过去，准备拾起来，这时它发现里面竟然卧着一只惊恐万状的小白鼠。

“你在这儿干什么？”鸭子问，“不是吩咐你留在泥塘镇的吗？”

“我不想被撇下。”小白鼠说，“我想看看非洲是什么样子。我那儿有亲戚。我就藏在行李中，跟压缩饼干一起被带上了船。船沉时，我害怕极了，因为我游不远。我尽力地游啊游，但是很快就筋疲力尽了，我以为自己要沉下去了。这时，老头儿的帽子恰好漂了过来，我就爬了进去，我不想被淹死啊。”

鸭子把帽子连同里面的小白鼠一起带上了岸，交给了医生。大家都围过来看。

“这就是人们所说的‘偷渡者’。”鹦鹉说。

很快，他们在行李箱里找了一处地方，这样小白鼠就可以舒舒服服地旅行了。猴子奇奇突然说道：“嘘！我听到丛林里有脚步声！”

他们全都不再说话，侧耳倾听。不大一会儿，一个黑人从树林里走了出来，问他们在那儿干什么。

“我叫约翰·杜立德，是医学博士，”医生说，“是被请来非洲给患病的猴子们治病的。”

“你们全都必须交由国王发落。”黑人说。

“什么国王？”医生问，他不想浪费任何时间。

“乔里金基的国王，”黑人回答说，“所有这些土地都属于他，所有的外地人都必须交给他处理。跟我走一趟吧。”

他们收拾行李，跟着那个人向丛林里走去。





第六章　波利尼西亚与国王


在密林中走了一小段路后，他们来到了一片开阔地，看到了国王的宫殿。宫殿是用泥砌成的。

这儿是国王、厄门特鲁德王后和他们的儿子邦波王子居住的地方。王子外出到河里钓鲑鱼去了。国王和王后正坐在宫殿门前的一把伞下面。厄门特鲁德王后已经睡着了。

医生走向宫殿。国王问他有什么事儿。医生把他来非洲的原因告诉了国王。

“不允许你从我的国土上经过。”国王说，“许多年前，有一个白人上岸来。我当时对他非常友好。可是，他却掘土挖金，为谋取象牙，杀死了所有大象，然后偷偷坐船跑了，甚至连声谢谢都没说。从那以后，我绝不再让一个白人从乔里金基的国土上通过。”

说完，国王转身对站在旁边的几个黑人说道：“把这个巫医和他所有的动物统统带走，锁到最结实的牢房里去。”

六个黑人将医生和他所有的宠物带了下去，把他们关进了一个石牢里。石牢仅有一扇小窗，开在高高的墙上，窗上插着一道道栅栏，牢门厚实而坚固。

大家都非常难过。小猪珈珈开始哭了起来。奇奇说，如果它再不住嘴，就要打它的屁股，它这才安静下来。

“我们全都在这儿吗？”医生渐渐地适应了牢里昏暗的光线后问道。

“在，我想都在。”鸭子说着，数了起来。

“波利尼西亚在哪儿？”鳄鱼问，“它不在这儿。”

“你肯定吗？”医生说，“再看看。波利尼西亚！波利尼西亚！你在哪儿？”

“我猜它逃走了。”鳄鱼嘟囔着说，“它就是这样！朋友们一有难，它就溜到林子里去了。”

“我才不是那样。”说着，鹦鹉从医生外套下摆的口袋里钻了出来，“大家知道，我体形小，可以从窗栅栏中间钻出去。我生怕他们把我关进笼子，趁国王忙着说话，我躲到了医生的口袋里，也进来了！这就是人们所说的‘计策’。”它用嘴巴梳理着羽毛说。

“我的天哪！”医生叫道，“幸亏我没有坐到你身上。”

“听着，”波利尼西亚说，“今天晚上，天一黑，我就从这个窗栅栏悄悄钻出去，飞到王宫。然后，你们明白，我会很快找到一个办法，让国王把我们全都放出去。”

“噢，你能做什么呀？”珈珈说着，翘起鼻子又哭了起来，“你只不过是一只鸟！”

“完全正确。”鹦鹉说，“可是，别忘了，尽管我仅仅是一只鸟，却能像人一样说话，而且我了解这些人。”

那天夜里，当月亮照在棕榈树上，国王的手下都睡着时，鹦鹉悄悄地钻过牢房的栅栏，飞到了王宫。一星期前，王宫餐具室的窗户被一只网球打破了。波利尼西亚就是从这个玻璃上的破洞中间飞进去的。

它听到邦波王子在宫殿后面的卧室里打呼噜，就踮起脚尖上了楼，它来到国王的卧室门前，轻轻推开门，偷偷向里张望。

那天晚上，王后到表妹家跳舞去了，国王在床上睡得正香。

波利尼西亚轻轻地溜了进去，钻到了床底下。

它咳嗽了一声，就像杜立德医生平时咳嗽的那样。波利尼西亚能模仿任何人。

国王睁开眼睛，睡意蒙眬地问道：“厄门特鲁德，是你吗？”他以为是王后跳舞回来了。

鹦鹉又咳嗽了一声——像男人一样声音洪亮。国王一下子坐了起来，睡意顿消，问道：“是谁？”

“我是杜立德医生。”鹦鹉说——跟医生平时说话的腔调一模一样。

“你在我的卧室干什么？”国王叫道，“你胆敢逃出牢房！你在哪儿？我看不见你。”

鹦鹉只是大笑——爽朗长久地欢笑，就像医生的笑声。

“别笑了。马上出来，让我看见你！”国王说。

“愚蠢的国王！”波利尼西亚回答说，“你忘了你是在跟世界上最了不起的人——医学博士约翰·杜立德说话吗？你当然看不见我了。我已经让自己隐身。我无所不能。你现在听着：我今天晚上是来警告你的。如果你不让我和我的动物们从你的王国经过，我就让你和你的所有臣民都像猴子一样生病。我只要抬抬小手指，就能让人康复，或者教人生病。你马上派你的士兵去把牢门打开，否则等不到明天太阳爬上乔里金基的山顶，你就会得流行性腮腺炎。”

这时，国王浑身哆嗦，他开始胆战心惊起来。

“医生，”他哭道，“我一定按你吩咐的去办。请不要抬小手指！”说着，他翻身下床，跑去叫士兵们打开牢门。

他一走，波利尼西亚就悄悄下楼，从餐具室的窗户离开王宫。

可是，王后用钥匙开后门进来时，正巧看见鹦鹉飞出那扇破窗。国王回来睡觉时，她就把自己看到的情景告诉了他。

国王这才明白自己上当了，他大为恼火，马上转身奔回牢房。

可是，为时已晚。牢门大开，地牢里空空荡荡。医生和他的所有动物都已经走了。





第七章　猴桥


厄门特鲁德王后从来没有见过丈夫像今天晚上这样可怕。他咬牙切齿，怒不可遏，见谁就说谁傻瓜。他气得向宫廷猫扔牙刷。他穿着长睡衣跑来跑去，把所有卫兵都派去丛林里抓医生，接着还把所有仆人也都派了去，厨师、园丁、理发师以及邦波王子的师傅，甚至连王后也被打发去帮士兵们搜人，即使她穿了一双紧脚鞋，跳舞已经跳得很累了。

在此期间，医生和他的动物们在密林中急速穿行，尽快朝猴国方向奔跑。

珈珈腿短，不一会儿就跑累了，医生只好抱着它跑。因为还要拎行李箱，提手提包，他们行动起来相当困难。

乔里金基的国王认为，卫兵轻而易举就能找到他们，因为医生是在一块陌生的土地上，不认识路。可是，他错了，因为猴子奇奇对丛林里的路无所不知，甚至比国王的手下还熟悉。它领着医生和宠物们跑进密林最深处一个从来没有人到过的地方，让他们藏进一个高大岩石间的大树洞里。

“咱们最好在这儿等着，”奇奇说，“一直等那些士兵都回去睡觉，咱们再继续往猴国那边赶吧。”

就这样，他们在树洞里待了整整一个晚上。

他们不时地听到国王的卫兵在附近搜寻和交谈的声音。不过，他们非常安全，因为除了奇奇之外，谁都不知道这个藏身地，甚至连其他猴子也不知道。

阳光穿过头顶茂密的叶子照射了下来。这时，他们终于听到了厄门特鲁德王后疲惫不堪地说道，再找也没用了，不妨回去睡觉吧。

士兵们一撤，奇奇就把医生和动物们从躲藏的地方领了出来，朝猴国进发了。

漫漫征程，他们经常会很累，尤其是珈珈。不过，它一哭，大家就给它椰子，让它喝里面它非常喜欢的椰奶。

他们总是吃喝不愁，因为奇奇和波利尼西亚了解丛林里生长的所有不同种类的水果和蔬菜，比如，椰枣、无花果、落花生、姜和山药，而且还知道在哪儿可以找到它们。他们经常用野橙汁制作柠檬水，再加入从树洞的蜂巢里搞来的蜂蜜，味道甜甜的。无论大家想要什么，奇奇和波利尼西亚似乎总有办法帮他们搞到，或者搞到类似的东西。一天，它们甚至还给医生搞了一些烟草。当时，医生随身带来的烟叶已经抽完了，他想抽烟。

晚上，他们睡在用棕榈叶搭成的帐篷里，躺在干草铺成的又厚又软的床上。没过多久，大家便习惯了这种长途跋涉，也不感到那么累了，而且还喜欢上了这种旅途生活。

不过，让大家始终高兴的是，每当夜幕降临时，他们总能驻足休息。这时，医生常常用树枝生上一小堆火。吃过晚饭，他们常常在火边围成一圈，听波利尼西亚唱大海的歌儿，或者听奇奇讲丛林的故事。

奇奇讲的好多故事都非常有趣。尽管在杜医生开始记载猴子的历史之前，它们根本没有自己的历史书，但是它们通过给自己的孩子们讲故事的形式，把发生的一切都记得清清楚楚。奇奇讲的好多事儿都是祖母告诉它的，是很久很久以前发生在诺亚和大洪水之前的故事，那时人们穿熊皮，住岩洞，吃生羊肉，还不懂得烹饪，从来没有见过火。奇奇还跟大家讲到了像火车那样长的巨大猛犸象和蜥蜴，说它们当时在山上到处溜达，啃吃树顶。大家常常听得兴致勃勃，总是在它讲完故事了，才发现火早已熄灭，只好赶忙又去拾一些树枝，再点上一堆火。

话说国王的卫队回去后，报告国王说他们没有找到医生。国王又把他们派了出来，并下令他们必须守在丛林里，直至抓住医生。在此期间，医生和他的动物们一直在向猴国进发，他们以为自己平安无事了，不知道其实国王的手下仍然在后面追寻。如果奇奇知道这个情况，它十有八九就会把大家再次藏起来。可是，它并不知道。

一天，奇奇爬上一块高高的岩石，越过树梢向远处眺望。下来后，它说，他们现在离猴国已经很近了，很快就会到达那儿。

就在那天傍晚，他们果然见到了奇奇的表兄和好多其他的猴子。这些是没有生病的猴子，它们正坐在沼泽地边的树上，一边瞭望，一边等待他们。这些猴子看到这位名医真的来了，便发出了很大的声音，又是欢呼，又是挥舞树叶，它们从树枝间荡出来，向他致意。

它们争着为医生提包扛箱，帮他拿所有的东西，一只大猴子甚至还背起了珈珈，因为珈珈又累了。其中两只猴子急忙冲到前面，去告诉那些生病的猴子：那个了不起的医生终于来了。

然而，那些一直尾随其后的国王的手下听到那些猴子的欢呼声，知道了医生的方位，连忙赶来抓他。

背着珈珈的大猴子走得慢，落在后面。它看到国王的卫队长悄悄穿过树林摸了过来，赶紧追上医生，叫他快跑。

大家拼命跑了起来，比以往任何时候都卖力，尾随其后的国王的手下也开始跑了起来，卫队长跑得最猛。

突然，医生绊在医药包上，摔倒在了泥里。卫队长想，这下他保准能抓住医生。

可是，卫队长虽然头发很短，耳朵却非常长。在他冲过来想要抓住医生时，他的一只耳朵牢牢地挂在了树上，其他卫兵只好停下来帮他。

医生趁这个机会连忙爬起来，他们又接着向前跑，跑着跑着，奇奇喊道：“太好了！我们快到了！”

可是，在进入猴国之前，他们先来到了一个陡峭的悬崖边，悬崖下面是湍急的河水。这儿是乔里金基国的边界。猴国在另一边——河对岸。

小狗吉普向这异常陡峭的悬崖下面一看，说道：“天哪！咱们可怎么穿过去呀？”

“哎呀！”珈珈叫道，“国王的卫队近在咫尺了——瞧，他们来了！恐怕咱们又要被抓回去坐牢了。”说着，它就哭了起来。

这时，那只背着珈珈的大猴子一把将它放到地上，冲其他猴子大喊：“小子们——吊桥！快！——搭吊桥！我们只有一分钟的时间了。卫队长已经脱开身来，像鹿一样追上来了。快点儿！吊桥！吊桥！”

医生开始纳闷它们用什么东西搭桥，便四下打量，看看它们是不是在什么地方藏有木板。

可是，当他掉头再看悬崖上时，只见跨河之上已经为他搭好了一座吊桥，是活生生的猴子搭成的！他刚才一转身的工夫，猴子们快如闪电，相互抓住对方的手脚，用身体搭成了这座桥。

那只大猴子对医生喊道：“过！过！——你们大家——快过！”

珈珈有点儿害怕，不敢从那么高、高得让人眩晕的地方，踩着这么窄的桥过河。不过，它还是安然无恙地过去了，剩下的也都过去了。

约翰·杜立德最后一个过桥。他刚走到对岸，国王的卫队就冲到了悬崖边。

国王的卫兵们挥舞拳头，气得大喊大叫。他们知道自己来得太晚了。医生和他的所有动物已经安全抵达了猴国，“桥”也被拽到了对岸。

这时，奇奇转身对医生说：“好多大探险家以及有着花白胡子的博物学家们都曾一连几个星期躲在丛林里，等看猴子们玩那个把戏。我们从来没有让一个白人看过。你是第一个看见这著名‘猴桥’的白人。”

听了这话，医生感到非常开心。





第八章　狮子王


约翰·杜立德手忙脚乱，忙得不可开交。他发现成千上万只猴子都病了——有大猩猩、猩猩、黑猩猩、狗脸狒狒、金丝猴、灰毛猴、红毛猴等各种各样的猴子。而且好多已经病死了。

他做的第一件事儿，就是把生病的猴子和健康的猴子隔离开来，然后教奇奇和它的表兄盖了一座小草房，让那些仍然健康的猴子前来打预防针。

三天三夜，猴子们源源不断地从丛林、山谷和小山里赶到小草房。医生夜以继日地坐在那儿，不停地打针。

接着，他又建了一座房子——一座大房子，里面铺了好多床；他将那些生病的猴子安顿了进去。

然而，有这么多猴子得病，却没有足够多的健康猴子来护理。于是，他就给其他动物——比如，狮子、豹子和羚羊——捎信儿，让它们过来帮忙护理。

可是，狮子王是一个非常骄傲的家伙。它来到医生放满床的大病房，怒气冲冲、一脸不屑的样子。

“先生，你竟敢要求我？”它怒视着医生，“你竟敢要求我——我这个兽中之王来伺候这么多的脏猴子？哎呀，我甚至都不愿意把它们当饭后的零食吃哩！”

狮子看上去十分可怕，但是医生努力装出不怕它的样子。

“我并不是要求你去吃它们。”他平静地说，“再说，它们也不脏。今天早上全都洗了澡。倒是你的皮毛看上去需要梳理——迫切需要梳理。现在听着，我告诉你：狮子可能也有生病的那一天。如果你现在不帮其他动物，等狮子们倒霉时，你可能就会发现自己孤立无援了。这种事儿，骄傲者经常会碰到。”

“狮子从来不会有麻烦，它们只会制造麻烦。”说完，狮子王翘起鼻子，昂首阔步地走出去，进了丛林，它感觉自己相当聪明伶俐。

豹子也骄傲了起来，说它们不愿帮忙。当然还有羚羊，虽然它们胆子极小，不敢像狮子那样对医生无礼，但却用蹄子刨地，傻笑着说自己以前从来没有当过护士。

可怜的医生急得发疯，不知道从哪儿才能找到足够多的帮手，来照顾这几千只卧病在床的猴子。

狮子王回到自己的洞穴，竟看到妻子狮后头发凌乱地跑了出来。

“有一头小狮子不想吃东西。”它说，“我不知道该如何是好。它从昨晚起就没有吃什么东西了。”

说着，它就哭了起来，惶恐不安，浑身发抖，因为它不仅是一头母狮子，更是一位好母亲。

狮子王走进洞里，去看自己的孩子，只见两头非常漂亮的小狮子正躺在地上。其中一头好像病得不轻。

狮子王扬扬自得地把自己刚才对医生说的话说给妻子听。母狮气得差点儿把它赶出洞去。“你从来就不长脑子！”它尖叫道，“从这儿一直到印度洋，大家都在谈论这个神人，说他能治百病，说他人有多好，他可是全世界唯一能说动物语言的人啊！现在，眼下——咱们的孩子病了，你却要冒犯他！你这个大傻瓜！只有傻瓜才会对一个好医生粗鲁无礼。你──”说着，它就上前撕扯起了丈夫的头发。

“马上拐回去，”它大叫道，“向那个白人赔礼道歉。让其余所有没脑子的狮子跟你一起去，还有那些愚蠢的豹子和羚羊。全照医生吩咐的去做。用点儿劲儿！说不定，他会发善心，过来看看咱们的小狮子。现在就去！——快去，我告诉你！你不配做父亲！”

说完，它转身进了隔壁洞穴。那儿住着另一头母狮子。狮后就把这件事一五一十地告诉了它。

狮子王回到医生那儿，说：“我刚好路过这儿，进来看看。找到帮手了吗？”

“没有，”医生说，“没有找到。我急得要命。”

“时下帮忙的很难找，”狮子说，“动物们好像都不情愿再干活了。你不能怪它们——不管怎样……喏，看到你有困难，我不介意做一些力所能及的事儿，只是给你帮个忙，只要不必给那些猴子冲洗就行。我已经叫别的捕猎动物也过来帮忙了。豹子随时都可能到……噢，顺便说一句，我们家的小狮子病了。我觉得它没有什么大毛病。可是，我的妻子非常担心。如果你今晚路过那儿，能不能给它瞧瞧？”

这下可把医生高兴坏了，因为所有的狮子、豹子、羚羊、长颈鹿和斑马——森林中、山里和草原上的所有动物——都过来帮他干活了。由于来得太多了，他只好把其中一些打发走了，只留下了那些最聪明的。

没过多久，猴子们就渐渐地开始康复了。第一周结束时，原来放满病床的大房子已经空了一半。到第二周结束时，连最后一只猴子也都痊愈了。

医生总算把工作做完了。这时，他已经疲惫不堪，在床上一睡就是三天，连身子都没有翻一下。





第九章　猴子开会


奇奇守在医生的门外，不让任何动物去打扰他，直到他醒来为止。醒来后，约翰·杜立德告诉猴子们说，他现在必须返回泥塘镇。

听到这话，猴子们大为吃惊，因为它们还以为医生会永远跟它们在一起呢。当天夜里，猴子全都聚在丛林里，商议这件事儿。

黑猩猩首领站起来，说道：“为什么这个好人要离开呢？难道他跟我们在一起不开心吗？”

可是，谁也回答不了它。

接着，大猩猩站起来，说道：“我认为咱们应该一起去找他，请他留下来。也许咱们给他建一座新房子，铺一张更大的床，答应有足够多的猴子佣人为他干活，让他生活舒坦——说不定他到时候就不想走了呢。”

这时，奇奇站了起来。别的猴子全都小声说道：“嘘！瞧！大旅行家奇奇要讲话了。”

奇奇对它们说：“我的朋友们，恐怕你们挽留医生也没用。他在泥塘镇欠别人钱，他说他必须回去还钱。”

猴子们好奇地问道：“什么是‘钱’？”

奇奇告诉它们说，在白人的国家里，没有钱，就什么也得不到；没有钱，什么也干不成——没有钱，简直无法生活。

一些猴子问道：“可是，不付钱，就不能吃喝吗？”

奇奇却摇了摇头，随后告诉它们说，它跟着那个手风琴艺人那会儿，它甚至还被迫向孩子们讨过钱呢。

黑猩猩首领转身对最老的猩猩说道：“表兄，这些人肯定是怪物！谁会愿意住在那样的一个国家啊？哎呀，真没用！”

这时，奇奇说：“我们准备来你们这儿时，既没有船过海，也没有钱买旅途上吃的食物。有个人就借给了我们一些饼干。我们答应过他，等一回去就把钱付给他。我们还从一个水手那儿借了一条船，但是那条船在我们到达非洲海岸时撞在礁石上撞碎了。医生说他必须回去，给那个水手搞一条船——因为那个人很穷，那条船就是他的全部家当。”

一时间，猴子们全都不吭声了，一动不动地坐在地上，苦思冥想。

最后，最大的狒狒站起来，说道：“我认为，咱们应该送给他一件漂亮的礼物让他带上，才能让他离开咱们的国家，这样也许可以让他知道，我们对他所做的一切充满了感激之情。”

一只娇小的红猴子坐在树上，朝下面喊道：“我也这么认为！”

随即，大家纷纷大声嚷嚷着：“对，对。咱们送给他一件白人从来没有过的最漂亮的礼物！”

接着，它们又开始纳闷，相互询问，要送给他礼物，送什么最好。有一只猴子说：“五十袋椰子！”另一只猴子说：“一百把香蕉！在他那个付钱才吃得上东西的国家，他至少不用买水果了！”

奇奇告诉它们说，这些东西都太沉了，带不了那么远，而且吃不到一半就会腐烂。

“如果你们真想让他高兴，”它说，“送给他一只动物。你们放心，他会善待这只动物。送给他一只动物园里没有的珍稀动物。”

猴子们问它：“什么是动物园？”

奇奇对它们解释说，在白人的国家里，动物园就是把动物放进笼子、让人参观的地方。

猴子们听了，无不震惊，纷纷说道：“这些人像没有思想的小孩子——既愚蠢又可笑。唏！它说的是牢房。”

于是，它们又问奇奇，应该送给医生什么珍稀动物，才是那些白人以前从未见过的。

金丝猴长老问：“他们那儿有鬣蜥吗？”

奇奇说：“有，伦敦动物园有一只。”

另一个又问：“他们有霍加皮吗？”

奇奇说：“有。比利时有。五年前，那位手风琴艺人带我去过那儿，在一个叫安特卫普的大城市里有一只霍加皮。”

又一只猴子问道：“他们有‘推我拉你’吗？”

这回，奇奇说：“没有。没有一个白人见过推我拉你。咱们就送给他这个吧。”





第十章　最稀罕的动物


推我拉你现在已经灭绝了。那就是说，再也没有了。可是，很久以前，杜立德医生还健在时，非洲丛林的最深处还有一些；即使在那个时候，它们也非常非常稀少。它们没有尾巴，却在两端各长着一个头，每个头上都长有尖角。它们非常怕人，很难逮住。黑人捉动物大多都是趁动物不注意时从后面悄悄靠近。可是，对付推我拉你，就不能采取这种方法——因为，不管从哪个方向靠近它，它总是面对着你。此外，睡觉时只有半边身体入睡，另一边的脑袋一直醒着，观察着。这就是它们从来没有被捕获、从来没有在动物园里被参观的原因。尽管好多很伟大的猎手和很精明的动物园主用了数年时间，到丛林里风雨无阻地搜寻推我拉你，但是一只也不曾逮住过。就连在好多年前那个时候，它都是世界上唯一的双头动物。

猴子们动身前往森林，去捕捉这种动物。它们跋涉了好多英里后，其中一只猴子在河边发现了一些奇特的脚印。它们知道，在这附近必定有一只推我拉你。

它们沿着河岸没走多远，便看到有一个地方草长得又高又密；它们猜它就在那儿。

于是，猴子们全体手拉手，在高草四周围成了一个大圆圈。那只推我拉你听到它们过来，想冲破猴子的包围圈，但是怎么也冲不出去。看到自己逃也没用，它就索性坐了下来，等着看它们想干什么。

猴子们问它愿不愿意随杜立德医生去白人国，让人参观。

它使劲摇着两个脑袋，说：“当然不愿意！”

猴子们对它解释说，它不会被关在动物园里，仅仅是让人观看。它们还告诉它说，医生是一个非常善良的人，不过就是没有钱。人们愿意掏钱观看一只双头动物，这样医生就会富起来，就可以偿还他为来非洲向人家借的那条船的船钱了。

可是，它回答说：“不。你们知道我有多么不愿见人——我不喜欢让人盯着看。”说着，它几乎要哭起来了。

接下来的三天，猴子们试图说服它。

第三天结束时，它说，它要先跟它们去看看医生是一个什么样的人。

于是，猴子们就把推我拉你带了回来。它们来到医生的小草房跟前，敲了敲门。

鸭子正在里面装行李箱，说道：“进来！”

奇奇豪情满怀地带着那只动物走了进去，让医生瞧。

“它到底是什么？”约翰·杜立德盯着这个奇特的动物问道。

“天哪！”鸭子叫道，“它是怎么下定决心的呢？”

“我看，它好像就没有下决心。”小狗吉普说。

“医生，这就是推我拉你，”奇奇说，“非洲丛林里最稀罕的动物，世界上唯一的双头兽！带它回去，你可就发财了。人们掏多少钱都愿意来看它。”

“可是，我一点儿都不需要钱。”医生说。

“不，你需要。”鸭子嘎嘎说，“难道你不记得咱们在泥塘镇是怎样省吃俭用，才付清肉店账钱的吗？还有，你不是说过要赔给水手一条新船吗？怎么赔？——除非咱们有钱去买。”

“我准备给他造一条船。”医生说。

“噢，请理智点儿！”嘎嘎嚷道，“你要造船，去哪儿弄造船需要的所有木材和钉子呢？再说，咱们靠什么生活？回去后咱们会比以前更穷。奇奇说的对极了，带上这只模样奇特的动物！”

“好吧，也许你说的有道理。”医生咕哝道，“它一定会成为一只可爱的新宠物。不过，这个──你叫它什么来着──真想去国外吗？”

“是的，我愿意。”推我拉你说。它从医生的脸上一眼就看出他是一个值得信赖的人。“你对这儿的动物那么好——猴子们告诉我说，我是唯一可以用来报答你的动物。不过，你必须答应我，如果我不喜欢白人国的生活，你就要把我送回来。”

“啊，当然——当然，当然可以。”医生说，“请问，你和鹿科动物肯定有亲戚关系，对吧？”

“对，”推我拉你说，“我的母亲那边属于阿比西尼亚瞪羚和亚洲岩羚羊。我父亲的曾祖父是最后一只独角兽。”

“太有意思了！”医生低声说着，他从嘎嘎装好的箱子里掏出一本书，翻看起来，“让我们看看布封伯爵怎么说──”

“我注意到，”鸭子说，“你只用一张嘴说话。你的另一个脑袋也会说话吗？”

“噢，当然会。”推我拉你说，“不过，一般，我用另一张嘴来吃东西。这样的话，我就能边吃边谈，不会无礼。我们推我拉你总是很有礼貌。”

收拾完行李，一切准备就绪要出发时，猴子们为医生举办了一场盛大的宴会，丛林里所有的动物都来了。它们带来了菠萝、杧果、蜂蜜，还有各种好吃好喝的东西。

大家全都吃完后，医生站起来，说道：“我的朋友们，我不善于像一些人那样晚宴后长篇大论。我刚才吃了好多水果和蜂蜜。可是，我想告诉你们，离开你们这个美丽的国家，我很伤心。我在白人国还有事儿要处理，必须得走。我走后，你们记住吃饭前千万别让苍蝇落在你们的食物上，下雨时不要睡在地上。我——呃——呃——我希望你们从此全都生活幸福。”

说完，医生坐了下来。猴子们全体鼓掌，经久不息。它们相互转告：“我们可要永远记住，他曾和我们坐在一起吃过饭，在这儿，在这棵树下。因为他的确是一个最伟大的人！”

这时，大猩猩把一块巨石滚到了桌面上，它毛茸茸的胳膊有七匹马那么大的力气。它说：“这块巨石将会永远标明这个地方。”

即使到了今天，这块巨石也仍然耸立在丛林的中心地带。每当猴妈妈们带着家人穿过这片森林时，仍然会从树枝间指着下面那块巨石，小声对孩子们说道：“嘘！它在那儿——瞧，那就是大病之年那个善良的白人跟我们坐在一起吃饭的地方！”

宴会结束后，医生和他的宠物们起程前往海岸边。

猴子们一路随行，纷纷为他扛行李箱、拎提包，一直把他送到了国界边。





第十一章　黑王子


到了河边，他们驻足告别。这花了很长时间，因为数千只猴子都想跟约翰·杜立德握手。

最后，医生和他的宠物们独自上路了。波利尼西亚说：“咱们经过乔里金基国时，一定要蹑手蹑脚、轻言低语。一旦国王听到我们的声音，他一定会派卫兵再来抓我们。我相信，他还在为上次被我戏弄的事儿大动肝火。”

“我在想，”医生说，“我们到哪儿弄一条船坐回家……噢唔，说不定我们会在海滩上找到一条碰巧没有人使用的船。不过，‘千万要到台阶再抬脚’。”

一天，他们正通过森林一处非常茂密的地方，奇奇跑到前面去找椰子。奇奇离开这段时间，医生和剩下的动物们因为不太熟悉丛林里的小路，在密林深处迷了路。他们转来转去，怎么也找不到前往海岸的路。

奇奇哪儿都看不到大家的影子，心里七上八下。它爬上高树，从树梢上四下张望，想看到医生的高帽。它一边挥手，一边叫喊，把动物们的名字统统喊了一遍。可是没用。他们好像全都消失了。

他们的确迷了路，迷得还不轻，严重偏离了小路。丛林十分茂密，到处都是灌木丛、匍匐枝和藤蔓，有时他们根本无法行走。医生只好拿出随身小折刀，开路前进。他们跌跌撞撞地误入过一些沼泽地，被稠密的旋花缠绕植物完全缠住过身体，荆棘划得他们到处是伤，有两次差点儿把医药包丢在下层林丛里。他们的麻烦好像没完没了，而且哪儿都找不着路。

他们就这样晕头转向走了好多天，衣服破了，脸上沾满了泥，最后误入了国王的后花园。国王的卫兵们马上跑过来，抓住了他们。

波利尼西亚趁人不注意，飞到花园的一棵树上，藏了起来。医生以及其余的动物都被押到了国王面前。

“哈，哈！”国王叫道，“你们又被抓住了！这次你们可跑不了了。把他们统统押进牢房，门上加两道锁。这个白人后半辈子都要给我擦厨房的地板！”

医生和他的宠物们再次被带进牢房关了起来。随后，医生被告知说，明天早上他就必须开始擦厨房的地板。

大家都闷闷不乐。

“真烦。”医生说，“我真的必须赶回泥塘镇。如果不快点儿赶回家，那个可怜的水手会以为我偷走了他的船……不知道那些铰链拴没拴牢。”

门很结实，锁得也很牢。几乎没有逃出去的机会。珈珈又开始哭了起来。

在这期间，波利尼西亚还卧在后宫花园的那棵树上。它一声不吭，眨着眼睛。

这种情况出现在波利尼西亚身上，往往标志着形势非常不妙。每当它默默无语，光眨眼睛时，便说明有人一直在找麻烦，它正在想法摆平。谁要找波利尼西亚或它的朋友麻烦，以后十有八九总会后悔。

波利尼西亚突然看见奇奇在树丛中飞来荡去，在寻找医生。奇奇也发现了它，随即来到它藏身的树上，询问医生的下落。

“医生和所有那些动物都被国王的卫兵抓去，关进了牢房。”波利尼西亚低声说道，“我们在丛林里迷了路，误入了王宫花园。”

“可是，不是有你给他们带路吗？”奇奇问道。它开始责备鹦鹉，因为鹦鹉在奇奇去找椰子时让大家迷了路。

“都怨那头蠢猪，”波利尼西亚说，“它总是跑下小路寻找姜根吃。我动不动就得忙着去追赶它，把它带回原路，搞得我在沼泽那儿向左转，没有向右拐。嘘！瞧！邦波王子来花园里了！绝不能让他瞧见咱们。无论如何都不要动！”

果然是国王的儿子邦波王子。只见他打开园门，走了进来，腋下挟一本童话书，嘴里哼着一首忧伤的曲子，沿着沙砾小路溜达着来到了鹦鹉和猴子藏身的那棵树下。那儿有一个石凳。他就在石凳上躺下来，默念起了童话故事。

奇奇和波利尼西亚观察着他，一动也不敢动。

不一会儿，国王的儿子放下了书，疲惫地叹了口气。

“我要是个白王子，该多好啊！”他说，眼里露出了梦幻般悠远的神情。

鹦鹉像小女孩那样用又细又尖的嗓音大声说道：“邦波，有人说不定能把你变成白王子。”

国王的儿子惊得一下从凳子上跳了下来，四处张望。

“我听到的这是什么？”他叫道，“想必是从那边树荫里传来的仙女银铃般甜美的声音吧！好奇怪！”

“尊敬的王子，”波利尼西亚仍然一动不动，所以邦波看不到它，“你说得没错。是我——特丽普丝婷卡仙后跟你说话。我隐藏在一朵玫瑰花蕾里。”

“噢，告诉我，仙后，”邦波高兴得紧握双手叫道，“谁能把我变白呀？”

“你父亲的牢房里，”鹦鹉说，“躺着一位大名鼎鼎的奇人，名叫约翰·杜立德。他通晓不少医术和魔法，曾做出好多壮举呢。然而，你的父王却把他折磨得日渐憔悴、奄奄一息。等太阳落山时，你暗中找他去吧，勇敢的邦波。看吧，你将会变成最白的王子，永远赢得仙女的芳心。我只能说这么多了，现在我必须返回仙境了。再见！”

“再见！”王子叫道，“万分感谢，好心的特丽普丝婷卡！”

然后，他又在石凳上坐下来，面带微笑，等待太阳落下。





第十二章　医术和魔法


波利尼西亚确信没有人看到它时，就悄无声息地从树背后溜了出来，向牢房飞过去。

它看见珈珈把鼻子伸到窗户栅栏外，正用力闻王宫厨房飘来的饭香。它催小猪把医生叫过来，因为它想跟他说话。珈珈跑去叫醒了正在打盹的医生。

“听我说，”医生一露面，鹦鹉就低声说道，“邦波王子今晚要来见你。你得想个办法把他变白。不过，首先要让他向你保证，到时候他愿意打开牢门，给你找一条船过海。”

“这倒是很好。”医生说，“可是，把黑人变白不是那么容易。你说得就像他是一件衣服要重新染一遍似的。没有那么简单。‘是豹子能改变身上的斑点，还是埃塞俄比亚人会改变他们的肤色？’你懂吗？”

“那个我一窍不通。”波利尼西亚不耐烦地说，“可是，你务必把这个人变白。想办法，使劲儿想。你那包里还剩有好多药呢。如果你能改变他的肤色，他就什么事儿都愿为你做。这可是你逃出牢房的唯一机会。”

“好吧，我想也许有可能，”医生说，“让我来看看——”随后，他走到医药包前，喃喃说道，“在动物色素上加点儿氯化物——也许可以用氧化锌软膏，既然是暂时的，就厚厚地涂上一层。”

果然，当天夜里，邦波王子偷偷来到牢房找医生，他对医生说：“白人啊，我是一个不幸的王子。几年前，我去寻找书里说的睡美人。我周游世界很久，终于找到了她，像书上说的那样，我十分温柔地亲吻那位小姐，以唤醒她。她果真醒了过来。可是，她一看见我的脸，就大声叫道：‘噢，他真黑啊！’说完，她就跑了，不愿意嫁给我，又到别的地方睡去了。我带着满腔痛苦回到了父亲的王国。现在，我听说你是一个了不起的魔法师，带有好多有奇效的药剂。所以，我来向你寻求帮助。如果你把我变白，使我可以回到睡美人的身边，我愿意把半壁江山和你要求的任何东西送给你。”

“邦波王子，”医生一边若有所思地望着医药包里的那些瓶子，一边说道，“假如我把你的头发染成漂亮的金色，你开不开心？”

“不，”邦波说，“别的什么都不能让我满意。我必须成为一位白王子。”

“要知道，改变王子的肤色很难，”医生说，“是魔法师所能做的最难的一件事儿。你只想把脸变白，是吗？”

“是，仅此而已。”邦波王子说，“因为我要像其他白王子那样穿上闪亮的盔甲，戴上钢质的护手，骑在马背上。”

“要整个脸都变白？”医生问。

“对，整个脸，”邦波王子说，“我还想把眼睛变成蓝色，但是我又觉得那一定会很难。”

“是，是很难。”医生赶紧说道，“好吧，我会尽我所能。不过，你得很有耐心——你知道，有些药，谁也拿不太准。说不定得试两三次。你的皮肤很结实，对吧？噢，那就好。现在到灯这边来。噢，不过，在我做事之前，你必须先到海边准备好一条船，里面放上食物，以便渡我过海。你不能对任何人透露半个字。等我满足你的要求后，你必须放我和所有的动物出狱。你发誓，以乔里金基王冠的名义发誓！”

王子发完誓后，就到海边备好了一条船。

他回来后，说已经准备停当了。医生这才让嘎嘎拿来一个盆。他在盆里混合了好多药，让邦波王子把脸浸进去。

王子弯下腰，把脸伸进盆里，正好浸住耳朵。

他浸了好长时间，长得连医生似乎都忐忑不安起来，这条腿站站，那条腿站站，看看刚才用来混合的所有药瓶，又反复念念上面的标签。牢房里弥漫着一种强烈的味道，就像烧牛皮纸的气味。

最后，王子从盆里抬起头来，大口大口地喘着气。动物们都惊叫起来。

只见王子的脸变得雪白雪白的，原本土黄色的眼睛变成了具有男子汉气概的灰色！

约翰·杜立德借给他一面小镜子，让他照照看。他高兴地唱了起来，并开始在牢房里手舞足蹈。可是，医生要他别发出那么大的响声，他匆匆合上医药包，叫王子打开牢门。

邦波王子请求医生把小镜子留给他，因为这是乔里金基王国唯一的镜子，他想天天照镜子。可是，医生说他需要用它来照着刮胡子。

王子从口袋里掏出一串铜钥匙，打开了两道大锁。医生和他的所有动物尽其所能，飞快地向海边跑去。邦波王子靠墙站在空荡荡的牢房里，望着他们的背影，露出了开心的微笑。他那张大脸在月光下像磨光的象牙一样闪闪发光。

医生和动物们来到海边，看见波利尼西亚和奇奇正在船边的礁石上等候他们。

“我感觉对不起邦波王子。”医生说。

“我担心用的那种药维持不了多久。等他明天早上醒来时，十有八九还会像原来一样黑。正因为这样，我才不乐意把镜子留给他。不过，也许他会一直白下去——以前我从来没有用过那种混合剂。说实话，看到效果那么好，我自己也非常吃惊。可是，我不得不试一把，对吧？也许下半辈子我可以不给国王擦厨房了。那个厨房真脏！——我从牢房的窗户就能看到。唉，唉！可怜的邦波！”

“噢，他当然知道我们只是跟他开玩笑。”鹦鹉说。

“他们无权关押我们。”嘎嘎来回摇着尾巴生气地说，“我们从来没有伤害过他们。如果他真的又变黑了，那是他自作自受！我希望他的脸变成深黑色。”

“可是，他跟这件事没有任何关系。”医生说，“是国王，他的父亲，派人把我们关起来的——这不是邦波的错……我在想，该不该回去道歉——噢，算了——回泥塘镇后给他寄些糖果吧。谁知道呢？别忘了，也许他会一直白下去。”

“即使他变白，睡美人也绝不会要他。”嘎嘎说，“我认为，他原来的样子更好看。可是，不管变成什么颜色，他都不漂亮。”

“尽管如此，但他心好，”医生说，“当然，有些浪漫，但是心好。毕竟，‘做人漂亮才是真漂亮’。”

“我一点儿都不相信这个可怜的傻瓜见过什么睡美人，”小狗吉普说，“他十有八九是亲吻了苹果树下某个打盹的胖农妇。被吓一跳，也不能怪她！我不知道这回他会去亲吻谁。瞧他干的傻事儿！”

推我拉你、小白鼠、珈珈、嘎嘎、吉普和猫头鹰秃秃，都随医生上了船。可是，奇奇、波利尼西亚和鳄鱼留了下来，因为非洲才是它们真正的家，是它们出生的地方。

医生站在船上，隔海眺望，他这才想起，随行者当中，谁也不能给他们指引返回泥塘镇的路。

月光下，辽阔的海面看上去空旷而孤寂。他开始担心，等看不见陆地时，他们会不会迷失方向。

正在他一筹莫展时，透过夜幕，他们听到高空传来了一阵奇怪的沙沙声。动物们全都停止道别，侧耳倾听。

那声音越来越响，越来越大了，仿佛离他们越来越近了，听起来既像是秋风吹过白杨树叶的声音，又像是一场很大很大的雨打在屋顶的响声。

吉普鼻子朝天，尾巴绷直，说道：“是鸟！几百万只，飞得很快——就是！”

他们都抬头望去。只见成千上万只小鸟，像一大群小蚂蚁似的源源不断地掠过月亮表面。不一会儿，整个天空仿佛都飞满了小鸟，而且仍在源源不断地飞来，越来越多。小鸟太多了，一时间遮住了整个月亮，月光没有了，海上越来越暗，越来越黑了，就像暴雨云遮住太阳时那样。

很快，所有这些小鸟密密麻麻地向下飞来，贴着水面和陆地。夜空明朗，月亮又像先前那样明亮了。不过，它们始终没有喊叫，没有哭泣，也没有歌唱，只是此时比以往任何时候，翅膀扇动的声音都要大。它们纷纷落在沙滩上、船缆上，以及树以外的任何地方，医生这才看清，它们蓝翅白胸，一双毛茸茸的短腿。它们都找到地方落脚后，四周突然变得声息皆无。一切都是那么宁静，那么静寂。

在静谧的月光下，约翰·杜立德说道：“没想到咱们在非洲待了这么长时间。到家时，差不多都快到夏天了。这些是返回北方的燕子。燕子们，感谢你们等我们啊。你们考虑得真周到。现在，我们不必担心会在海上迷路了……拔锚起帆！”

海面上，船走远了，那些留下来的动物——奇奇、波利尼西亚和鳄鱼——都难过极了。一生中，它们还从来没有遇见过一个人，像沼泽地的泥塘镇的约翰·杜立德医生这样让它们喜欢。它们一遍一遍又一遍地大声说着再见，直到看不见船的踪影了，它们还站在岸边的礁石上挥泪招手。





第十三章　红帆蓝翅


回家途中，医生的船必须经过巴巴里海岸。这个海岸是大沙漠的海岸线，是一个荒凉孤寂的地方——到处都是沙子和石头。巴巴里海盗就生活在这儿。

这些海盗是一群大坏蛋，他们常常在海岸上等待水手们的船失事。看见有船经过，他们也经常驾驶快帆船追赶。在海上追上这样的船后，他们就会抢走船上所有的东西，带走船上的人，把船沉没，然后一路高歌返回巴巴里，而且还为自己做的坏事扬扬得意。他们常常让被抓的人给家里写信，向朋友们要钱。如果对方不送钱来，海盗们就会把人扔进大海。

一天，阳光明媚，医生和嘎嘎在船上走来走去锻炼身体，和煦的清风吹拂着船向前行进，大家都很高兴。这时，嘎嘎看到另一面船帆出现在海平面上，远远地跟在他们后面。那是一面红帆。

“我不喜欢那面船帆的外观。”嘎嘎说，“我有一种感觉，那只船不友善。恐怕我们又要有麻烦了。”

吉普当时正躺在不远处的阳光下睡觉，这时候忽然开始咆哮起来，还说着梦话。

“我闻到了烤牛肉的味道，”它咕哝道，“半生不熟的牛肉，上面还浇了棕色肉汁。”

“天哪！”医生叫道，“狗怎么了？睡梦中，它还在闻东西，说话？”

“我想是的，”嘎嘎说，“狗全都可以在睡梦中闻东西。”

“可是，它闻到了什么？”医生问道，“咱们船上没有烤牛肉呀。”

“是的。”嘎嘎说，“烤牛肉肯定是在那一只船上。”

“可是，隔着十英里远，”医生说，“它绝不可能闻那么远！”

“噢，能，它能。”嘎嘎说，“你问问它。”

这时，吉普还在熟睡，又开始咆哮起来，嘴唇生气地向上卷起，露出了洁白干净的牙齿。

“我闻到了坏人，”它咆哮说，“我闻到有史以来最坏的人。我闻到了麻烦。我闻到了打斗，六个坏蛋打一个勇士。我想帮他。汪──唔──汪！”于是，它大声吠叫着，把自己都吵醒了，一脸受惊吓的样子。

“看到了吧！”嘎嘎叫道，“那条船现在越来越近了。可以数出来有三面大帆——全都是红的。不管是什么人，他们是在追我们……我不知道他们是谁。”

“他们是坏水手，”吉普说，“他们的船非常快。他们肯定是巴巴里的海盗。”

“咱们必须给船再挂上些帆，”医生说，“这样能跑得更快，摆脱他们。吉普，下底舱，把你见到的帆统统拖上来。”

小狗急忙跑到底舱，把所能找到的帆全都拖了上来。

可是，即使把这些帆都挂上桅杆张起风，他们的船也还是不如海盗们的快。海盗船在后面不断往前，越来越近了。

“王子给我们的这条船真差劲儿，”小猪珈珈说，“想必是他所能找到的最慢的船。乘坐这条老驳船摆脱他们，还不如坐进盛汤的盖碗去赢得赛船比赛的希望大。瞧！他们现在有多近！那帮人脸上的胡子都能看清楚——他们一共六个人。我们打算怎么办？”

医生要嘎嘎飞到空中，告诉那些燕子，海盗在划快船追他们，问问燕子该怎么办。

闻听此事，燕子们全飞下来，落到了医生的船上。它们告诉医生尽快把长绳拆开，拆成好多根细绳，然后把所有这些细绳的一端系在船头。燕子们用爪子牢牢抓住那些细绳，拽着船向前飞行。

一两只燕子的话，力量不大，但是如果好大一群燕子聚在一起，那就不一样了。船头拴着千根细绳，每根上面又都有两千只燕子拽着，它们个个都是飞行高手。

医生立刻发现自己的船跑得那么快，快得让他不得不用双手抓紧帽子。他感觉像是船自己在波涛翻滚的大海上飞波穿浪。

身在急速飞驰的船上，动物们都又笑又跳，回头再看海盗船，只见它不是越来越大，而是越来越小了。红帆被远远地抛在了后面。





第十四章　老鼠的警告


海上拖船是一件辛苦活儿。两三个小时后，燕子们都翅膀酸痛，上气不接下气。它们给医生传话说，它们必须得马上休息一下，要把船拉到不远处的一座小岛边，把它藏在一个深海湾里，等喘足气后，再继续前进。

不一会儿，医生便看到了燕子提到的那座小岛。岛中央高高耸立着一座非常美丽的青山。

船安全驶进了海湾，从外面的远海看不到这条船。医生说他下船去岛上找些水——因为船上饮用水没有了。随后，他吩咐动物们全都出来，到草地上嬉戏玩耍，活动活动腿脚。

现在，当他们下船时，医生注意到一大窝老鼠从底舱窜出来，也在离开船。吉普便追了上去，追咬老鼠一向是他最喜欢的游戏。可是，医生叫住了它。

一只大黑鼠似乎想对医生说什么，它顺着船护栏，一边小心翼翼地爬过来，一边用眼角余光提防着小狗，它紧张不安地咳嗽了两三声，捋捋胡须，擦了擦嘴，说道：“啊哼——呃——医生，所有的船上都有老鼠，这你当然知道，是吧？”

医生说：“我知道。”

“那你听说过老鼠总是离开即将沉没的船吗？”

“是的，”医生说，“我听人说过。”

“人们说起这件事儿，”老鼠说，“总是嗤之以鼻，好像这是一件不光彩的事儿。可是，你不会怪我们，是吗？毕竟，要是能逃，谁愿意待在要沉的船上呢？”

“这很自然，”医生说，“很自然。我完全理解你……还有——你还有别的事儿想说吗？”

“有。”老鼠说，“我来是想告诉你，我们要离开这只船。不过，走之前，我们想提醒你，你坐的这条船问题成堆。它不安全，船帮不够结实，船板也朽了。不到明天晚上，它就会沉到海底去了。”

“可是，你怎么知道？”医生问。

“我们一向知道。”老鼠回答说，“我们尾巴尖上有那种刺麻感，就跟你脚麻时的感觉一样。今天早上六点钟，我正在吃早饭，尾巴尖突然开始刺麻。起先，我还以为是风湿病又犯了。于是，我去问姑妈她的感觉如何——你还记得它吗？就是那只长长的花斑鼠，相当瘦，去年春天曾去泥塘镇找你看过黄疸病——它说它的尾巴尖刺麻得很！于是，我们知道，不出两天，这只船肯定会沉没。我们全都打定主意，船一靠近陆地，我们就离开。医生，这条船有问题，不要再坐了，否则你肯定会被淹死……再见！我们现在要去岛上找一处好地方住。”

“再见！”医生说，“非常感谢你来告诉我。你考虑得很周到──非常周到！代我向你的姑妈问好。我完全记得她……吉普，别碰那只老鼠！过来！躺下！”

医生和他的动物们纷纷提着桶端着锅下了船，到岛上去找水。与此同时，燕子们抓紧时间休息。

“我不知道这岛叫什么名字。”医生一边爬山坡，一边说道，“看上去这是一个宜人的地方。鸟可真多啊！”

“噢，这是金丝雀群岛，”嘎嘎说，“你没有听见金丝雀在唱歌吗？”

医生驻足倾听。

“哎呀，真的是——一点儿没错！”他说，“我真笨哪！我想知道它们能不能告诉我们在哪儿能找到水。”

很快，那些金丝雀飞了过来。它们早就从候鸟那儿听说了杜立德医生的所有故事。它们把他领到一处清澈、凉爽又美丽的泉水边，那儿是金丝雀们经常洗澡的地方。它们还带他去看了长有鸟食的秀美草地，以及岛上其他所有的风景。

推我拉你很高兴他们来到这儿，因为它喜欢青草，远远胜过那些它一直在船上吃的干苹果。珈珈发现整个山谷都是野甘蔗，高兴得吱吱直叫。

不一会儿，他们便吃饱喝足，仰躺在草地上，金丝雀为他们唱着歌儿，这时两只燕子匆匆飞过来，慌里慌张，惶恐不安。

“医生！”它们叫道，“海盗们追进了海湾，他们全都上了你的船。他们正在底舱盗抢东西。他们离开了自己的船，船上没有人。你们赶紧到海边去，上他们的船逃走——这条船速度很快。不过，你必须抓紧时间。”

“好主意，”医生说，“太棒了！”

他马上把动物们召集起来，告别金丝雀，向海边跑去。

他们跑到海边，果然看见了挂着三面红帆的海盗船停在水里，而且正如燕子们所说，船上没有一个人，所有海盗都在医生的船舱里盗抢东西。

医生吩咐他的动物们放轻脚步。大家全都上了海盗船。





第十五章　巴巴里龙


要不是因为小猪在岛上啃湿甘蔗，头着凉感冒，事情本来会一帆风顺。当时的情形是这样的：

他们悄无声息地拔起锚后，正小心翼翼地把船划出海湾，珈珈突然打了个喷嚏，声音响亮。听到动静，另一条船上的海盗冲上了甲板，看是什么声音。

一见是医生要逃跑，他们就驾船横堵在了海湾入口处，不让医生逃到远海去。

隔着水面，坏蛋的首领，那个自称“巴巴里龙本·阿里”的人冲医生又是挥拳又是叫嚣：“哈！哈！你跑不掉了，我的好朋友！你想驾我的船逃走，呃？可是，你当水手不够好，比不过巴巴里龙本·阿里。我想要你那只鸭子，还有那只小猪。我们今天晚饭有猪排和烤鸭吃喽。务必让你的朋友送来满满一箱金子，我才会放你回家。”

可怜的珈珈开始哭了起来；嘎嘎也准备飞走逃命。可是，猫头鹰秃秃低声对医生说：“稳住他，别让他停嘴，医生，要对他和颜悦色。我们的旧船一定会很快沉没。老鼠说过，不到明天晚上，它就会沉到海底去——老鼠绝不会错的。要和颜悦色，直到船在他下面下沉。稳住他，别让他停嘴。”

“什么，直到明天晚上！”医生说，“好吧，我尽力而为……让我想想——我说什么呢？”

“噢，叫他们过来。”小狗吉普说，“我们可以打得过这帮可恶的混蛋。他们只有六个人。叫他们上来。等我们回到家，我很乐意讲给隔壁的那只牧羊犬，我曾咬过一个真正的海盗。让他们过来，我们能打过他们。”

“可是，他们有枪有剑。”医生说，“不，绝对不行。我必须跟他说话……喂，本·阿里──”

可是，还没等医生再说什么，那些海盗已经驾船靠得更近了。他们幸灾乐祸地哈哈大笑着，你一句我一句相互打趣道：“谁先去捉那只小猪啊？”

可怜的珈珈吓得要死；推我拉你开始在桅杆上磨头上的角，准备战斗；吉普不停地跳着、叫着，用狗语骂着本·阿里。

但是很快，海盗那边好像出了什么事儿，没有了欢笑，也不再打趣了，他们神情迷茫，一定有什么事儿搅得他们心神不安了。

本·阿里正盯着脚下看，突然大声吼道：“遭雷劈的！——伙计们，这船在漏水！”

于是，其他海盗仔细打量船侧外面，他们看到船确实一点点儿往下沉了。一个海盗对本·阿里说道：“这旧船真要沉的话，我们就应该看到有老鼠弃船的。”

吉普从对面船上喊道：“你们这群大傻蛋，船上绝不会再有老鼠离开了！它们两小时前就离开了！告诉你们，哈哈，‘我的好朋友！’”

不过，那帮人肯定听不懂它说的话。不久，那条船的船头就渐渐地开始下沉，而且越沉越快，直到船看上去几乎像头朝下竖着一般；海盗们只好紧紧抓住扶手、桅杆、缆绳以及可以防止滑落的任何东西。随后，海浪呼啸着冲了上来，灌进了所有的门窗。最后，船陡峭倾斜，沉入了海底，并发出了可怕的汩汩声，留下这六个坏蛋在海湾的深水里来回扑腾着。

他们中的一些人开始朝小岛岸边游去；另一些则向医生所在的船拼命游过来，想要上船。吉普不断地照他们的鼻子咬过去，所以他们吓得不敢爬上船沿。

突然，他们全都惊恐万状地大叫起来：“鲨鱼群！鲨鱼群来了！他们要吃掉我们！让我们上船吧！救命，救命啊！鲨鱼群！鲨鱼群！”

这时，医生才看到，整个海湾布满了飞快游过来的大鲨鱼的脊背。

一条大鲨鱼游到医生的船边，从水中伸出鼻子，对医生说：“你是著名的动物医生约翰·杜立德吗？”

“是，”杜立德医生说，“我就是约翰·杜立德。”

“是这样，”鲨鱼说，“我们知道这些海盗是一帮坏蛋，尤其是本·阿里。他们骚扰你，我们乐意为你效劳，吃掉他们，这样你就不会再有麻烦了。”

“谢谢你，”医生说，“这真是周到极了。可是，我想，没必要吃掉他们。我不发话，就不要让他们游上岸——只让他们在水里来回游，好吗？把本·阿里弄到这儿来，我有话对他说。”

鲨鱼游过去，把本·阿里驱赶到了医生这边。

“听着，本·阿里，”约翰·杜立德趴到船沿上，俯身对他说，“你一向作恶多端，我知道你杀了不少人。这些好鲨鱼刚才主动要求替我吃掉你们。海上要是没有你们，那将是一件幸事。可是，如果你答应按我说的去做，我就让你们平安离开。”

“我必须怎么做？”他低头斜视着水下正嗅着他一条腿的一条大鲨鱼问道。

“你绝不再杀人，”医生说，“你绝不再偷盗；你绝不再沉船；总之，你绝不再当海盗。”

“那我干什么？”本·阿里问道，“我怎么生活呀？”

“你和你那帮手下必须全部上这个岛当农夫，种鸟食，”医生回答说，“你们必须为金丝雀们种鸟食。”

巴巴里龙气得脸色发白。“种鸟食！”他厌恶地咕哝说，“难道不能当水手吗？”

“不能，”医生说，“你不能。你当水手的时间够长了，把多少好船好人都沉到了海底。后半辈子，你必须做一个安分守己的农夫。那条鲨鱼还在等着呢，别再浪费它的时间了，你做决定吧。”

“遭雷劈的！”本·阿里嘀咕道，“种鸟食！”随即，他又低头看了看水里，只见那条大鲨鱼正在嗅着他的另一条腿。

“很好，”他伤心地说，“我们愿意当农夫。”

“记住，”医生说，“如果你不遵守诺言，又开始杀人越货，我就会听到，因为那些金丝雀会来告诉我。毫无疑问，我会想法惩治你。尽管我没有你驾船在行，但是只要小鸟、野兽和鱼类还是我的朋友，我就不必害怕一个海盗头，哪怕他自称‘巴巴里龙’。现在去吧，做一个好农夫，平静地生活吧。”

说完，医生转身朝那条大鲨鱼挥了挥手，说道：“好了。让他们安全地游上岸吧。”





第十六章　神耳秃秃


再次谢过鲨鱼们的帮助，医生和他的宠物们坐上那条有三面红帆的快船，又一次踏上了回家的航程。

等来到开阔海域时，动物们全都跑下底舱去看他们这只新船里面是什么样子。此时，医生身靠扶手站在船尾，嘴里叼着烟斗，注视着金丝雀群岛渐渐地消失在傍晚的蓝色薄暮之中。

他站在那儿，正寻思那些猴子不知怎么样了，寻思家里的花园，等他回泥塘镇时，会变成什么样子，嘎嘎跌跌撞撞地爬了上来，满脸微笑，滔滔不绝。

“医生！”它叫道，“海盗们这条船真漂亮——漂亮极了。底舱里的床是用淡黄色丝绸做的，上面放了好几百个大枕头和垫子，地上铺着又厚又软的地毯，餐具是银质的，还有各种好吃好喝的，那可不是一般的东西。食物贮藏间，噢，就像一个食品店，应有尽有。你一辈子也没有见过像这样的——试想一下——那帮人，他们贮藏有五种不同的沙丁鱼！下去看看……噢，我们在下面还发现了一个小房间，门是锁着的。大家都非常想进去看看里面是什么。吉普说肯定是海盗们藏财宝的地方。可是，我们打不开门。你下去看看，能不能让我们进去。”

医生下到底舱一看，这的确是一只漂亮的船。他发现动物们围在一个小门前，争先恐后，议论纷纷，都在尽力猜测里面是什么。无论医生怎么转动门把手，门就是打不开。接着，他们开始寻找钥匙。门前蹭脚垫下面，所有地毯下面，所有碗碟柜、抽屉以及上锁的小柜里面，餐室内的大柜子里，什么地方都找遍了。

在寻找的过程中，他们发现了好多新奇的东西，肯定是海盗们从其他船上偷盗来的：几件克什米尔披肩，上面绣着金花，像蜘蛛网一样薄；几罐牙买加产的上好烟草；几只装满俄罗斯茶叶的象牙雕盒子；一把旧小提琴，断了一根弦，背面贴有一幅画；一套用珊瑚和琥珀雕成的大棋子；一副一拉手柄里面会有一把剑的拐杖；六只杯沿上镶有绿宝石和银子的葡萄酒杯；还有一只珍珠母做的大糖碗。可是，搜遍了整条船，他们也没有找到能开那把锁的钥匙。

他们又回到了那扇门前。吉普从锁眼向里瞧。可是，里面有什么东西背墙立着，它什么也看不见。

他们围站在那儿，不知道该怎么办。这时，猫头鹰秃秃突然说道：“嘘！——听！——我确信那里面有人！”

他们都安静下来，过了一会儿，医生说道：“你肯定弄错了，秃秃。我什么也听不见。”

“我敢保证有人。”猫头鹰说，“嘘！——又有了——难道你听不见吗？”

“是的，我听不见，”医生说，“那是什么声音？”

“我听见有人把手伸进口袋的声音。”猫头鹰说。

“可是，那几乎不会有任何声音，”医生说，“从这外面，你不可能听见。”

“对不起，可是我听见了。”秃秃说，“我告诉你，门那边有个人把手伸进了口袋。几乎一切东西都会发出声音，只要你的耳朵足够灵敏，就能听到。蝙蝠能听到鼹鼠在地下洞穴里走动的声音，它们认为自己是千里耳。可是，黑暗中，我们猫头鹰只用一只耳朵，就能根据小猫眨眼睛的方式，告诉你它是什么颜色。”

“好，好！”医生说，“你真让我吃惊。这非常有趣……再听一听，告诉我，他正在干什么。”

“我还拿不准，”秃秃说，“究竟是一个男的，还是一个女的。把我举起来，让我贴到锁眼上听听，我能很快告诉你答案。”

于是，医生举起猫头鹰，让它贴到了门锁上。

不一会儿，秃秃说：“现在他正用左手抹脸，是小手和小脸。可能是一个女的——不。现在他把前额上的头发拢到了后面——是一个男的，没错。”

“女人们有时也那样做。”医生说。

“对。”猫头鹰说，“不过，她们头发长，那样做时，会发出完全不同的声音……嘘！让那个坐立不安的小猪保持安静。现在都屏住呼吸，让我好好听听。我现在做的这件事难得很，而且这个讨厌的门又这么厚！嘘！大家都别动，闭上眼睛，屏住呼吸。”

秃秃埋下头，又用劲儿听了好久。

最后，它抬起头来，望着医生的脸，说道：“里面那个男的不开心。他哭泣。他小心翼翼，没有哭出声来，也没有抽鼻子，以免被我们发现他在哭。可是，我听见——一清二楚——一颗眼泪落在他袖子上的声音。”

“你怎么知道那不是天花板上的一颗水珠落在他身上呢？”珈珈问。

“啐！真无知！”猫头鹰嗤之以鼻，“天花板上落下一颗水珠会发出十倍大的声音！”

“好了，”医生说，“如果那个可怜的家伙不开心，我们就得进去看看他出了什么事儿。给我找一把斧子，我要把这个门劈掉。”





第十七章　海洋闲话篓


斧子马上就找来了。医生很快在门上劈了一个洞，刚好可以钻过去。

一开始，他根本什么也看不见，里面一团漆黑。他划了一根火柴。

房间相当小，没有窗户，天花板很低。至于家具，就一张小凳子。房间四周靠墙竖着一些大桶，桶底固定在地上，这样船颠簸时，桶就不会翻倒。大桶上方的木钉上面挂满了各种大大小小的白镴酒壶。房间里有一股浓烈的葡萄酒的气味。地板中央坐着一个小男孩，大约八岁，哭得正痛。

“我断言，这是海盗们的酒屋！”吉普低声说道。

“对。正是朗姆酒！”珈珈说，“这气味让我头晕。”

看到一个男人站在自己面前，还有些动物透过破门洞在盯着他看，小男孩仿佛吓得要命。可是，借着火柴的光亮，一看到医生的脸，他就不哭了，站了起来。

“你不是那帮海盗的人，对吗？”他问。

医生仰头朗声笑了好一会儿。小男孩也露出了微笑，走过来拉住医生的手。

“你笑起来像朋友，”他说，“不像海盗。你能告诉我，我舅舅在哪儿吗？”

“恐怕不能。”医生说，“你最后一次见他是什么时候？”

“是前天。”小男孩说，“我和舅舅乘小船出海打鱼，海盗上来抓住了我们。他们沉了我们的渔船，把我们俩带到了这条船上。他们对我的舅舅说，他们想让他像他们那样当海盗，因为无论在什么天气状况下，他都能很熟练地驾船。可是，舅舅说他不想当海盗，因为杀人偷盗绝不是好渔民干的事儿。海盗头本·阿里听了非常生气，他咬牙切齿说，如果舅舅不按他们说的做，就把他扔进海里。他们把我带到了底舱，我听到上面打了起来。第二天，他们再次让我上来时，我舅舅就不见了。我问海盗我舅舅在哪儿，可是他们不告诉我。我非常担心，怕他们已经把他扔进海里给淹死了。”

说着，小男孩又开始哭了起来。

“现在没事了，等一会儿，”医生说，“别哭。咱们先到餐室喝杯茶，商量一下这件事儿。说不定你的舅舅一直平安无事呢。你不知道他是不是被淹死了，对吗？这就好。也许我们能帮你找到他。我们先去喝杯茶，加上草莓果酱，然后我们商量一下看怎么办。”

动物们全都一直万分好奇地站在那儿听。医生领着小男孩进了餐室。他们正喝茶，嘎嘎来到医生的椅子后面，小声说道：“问一下鼠海豚，看男孩的舅舅是不是淹死了——它们一定知道。”

“好吧。”医生又拿起了一片果酱面包说。

“你的舌头发出的那些滑稽的咔嗒声是什么？”小男孩问道。

“噢，我刚才用鸭语说了两个词。”医生回答说，“刚才那位是嘎嘎，是我的一个宠物。”

“我根本不知道鸭子还有语言。”小男孩说，“所有这些动物也都是你的宠物吗？那个怪模怪样、俩脑袋的东西是什么？”

“嘘！”医生低声说道，“那是推我拉你。别让它看到我们在谈论它，它会非常难为情……告诉我，你是怎么被关进那个小屋的？”

“海盗去另外一条船上抢东西，就把我关到了那儿，当时我听到有人劈门，不知道会是谁。我很高兴是你。你认为，你能帮我找到舅舅吗？”

“噢，我们会竭尽全力。”医生说，“你的舅舅长什么样子？”

“他留着一头红发，”小男孩回答说，“红红的头发。他的胳膊上刺有一个铁锚图案。他身强力壮，是一个好舅舅，还是南大西洋上最棒的水手。他的渔船名叫‘俏萨利’，是一只装有索具的独桅纵帆船。”

“什么是‘索具独桅纵帆船’？”珈珈转身，小声问吉普。

“嘘！是那个人驾驶的船的种类。”吉普说，“保持安静，行吗？”

“噢，”小猪说，“这样啊？我还以为那是一种喝的东西呢。”

医生留小男孩在餐室里跟动物们玩耍。他来到甲板上，找寻一些路过这里的鼠海豚。

很快，一大群鼠海豚摇摆着，跳跃着，从水中游了过来，它们正要前往巴西。

见医生靠在扶手上，它们便游了过来，看他过得怎么样。

医生问它们，有没有见过一个满头红发、胳膊上文有一个铁锚的男人。

“你是说‘俏萨利’的主人吧？”鼠海豚们问道。

“是，”医生说，“就是这个人。他已经淹死了吗？”

“他的渔船沉没了，”鼠海豚们说，“我们看到它躺在海底。可是，里面没有人，我们去看过了。”

“他的小外甥跟我在一起，在我们的船上，”医生说，“他非常担心，那些海盗把他的舅舅扔进了海里。你们行行好，帮我查清楚，看这个人是不是的确已经被淹死了？”

“噢，他没有被淹死，”鼠海豚们说，“如果他被淹死了，我们肯定就会从深海十足目动物那儿听说了。海里的一切新闻，我们都无所不知。甲壳类动物叫我们‘海洋闲话篓’。——没有淹死，告诉小男孩，很抱歉我们不知道他舅舅的下落。不过，我们十分肯定，他没有淹死在海里。”

医生跑下底舱，把这个消息告诉了小男孩。小男孩高兴得直拍手。推我拉你背起小男孩，绕着餐室的桌子转起了圈儿。其他动物都跟在后面，用匙子敲打碟面，把这当成了一场庆祝游行。





第十八章　气味


“你的舅舅现在一定能找到，”医生说，“这是迟早的事儿——因为我们知道他没有被扔进海里。”

嘎嘎又过来，对医生低声说道：“请老鹰找找这个人。在活着的生物当中，只有老鹰视力最好，它们能在数英里高的空中数得清地上爬的蚂蚁。请老鹰们找找。”

医生派了一只燕子前去叫一些老鹰过来。

大约一小时后，小燕子带回来六只不同种类的老鹰：一只黑鹰，一只白头鹰，一只鱼鹰，一只金鹰，一只兀鹰，还有一只白尾海鹰。每只都有小男孩的两倍那么高。它们全都并排站在船扶手上面，就像一排弓背弯腰的士兵，冷峻、肃静、沉着，炯炯有神的大黑眼睛飞快地扫来扫去。

珈珈被它们吓得躲到了一只桶后面。它说，它感觉那些可怕的眼睛好像能一下子看进它的内心，看出午饭它偷吃了什么。

医生告诉老鹰们说：“有一个男的失踪了，是一个红头发的渔民，胳膊上有铁锚图案的印记。你们行行好，看能不能帮我们找到他？这个小男孩是这个人的外甥。”

老鹰们话不多。它们都声音粗哑，只回答说：“你可以放心，我们会为约翰·杜立德——竭尽全力。”

说完，它们就飞走了。随后，珈珈从木桶后面钻了出来，望着它们离去。它们向上飞呀飞，越飞越高，越飞越高。后来，医生只能看到，它们分开，朝东西南北不同方向飞走了，看上去就像几颗细小的黑色沙粒慢慢地爬过辽阔的蓝天。

“我的天哪！”珈珈压低嗓音说，“真高啊！我纳闷，它们离太阳那么近，却没有烧焦自己的羽毛！”

它们走了好大一会儿，回来时，差不多已是夜里。

老鹰们告诉医生说：“我们已经搜索了这大半个世界的所有海洋、所有国家、所有岛屿、所有城市和所有乡村，但是我们没能找到。在直布罗陀的主街上，我们看见面包店门口的手推车里有三根红发。可那不是人的头发，而是一件皮大衣上掉下来的毛。无论陆地还是海洋，都没有小男孩舅舅的任何踪影。如果我们都看不见他，他肯定不会被看到了……为了约翰·杜立德——我们已经尽了全力。”

说完，六只大鸟拍打着大翅膀，飞回了山中和岩石间它们各自的家。

“唉，”它们走后，嘎嘎说，“我们现在怎么办？必须找到这男孩的舅舅——没有其他办法。这孩子太小了，还不能独闯天下。男孩子们不像小鸭子，他们必须由人抚养长大……奇奇要是在这儿就好了，它肯定能很快找到那个人。好心的老奇奇！我不知道它现在过得怎么样！”

“要是波利尼西亚跟我们在一起就好了，”小白鼠说，“它很快就能想出办法来。你们还记得它第二次是怎样帮我们出狱的吧？哎呀，它可真聪明啊！”

“我不太看好那些老鹰，”吉普说，“它们就是自以为是。它们的视力也许很好。可是，你请它们去替你找个人，它们没有找到——居然还有脸回来说别人也找不到。它们太自以为是了，就像泥塘镇那只牧羊犬一样。我也不看好那些饶舌的鼠海豚，它们只能告诉我们，那个人不在海里。我们不想知道他不在哪儿——我们想知道的是他在哪儿。”

“噢，别说那么多了，”珈珈说，“说起来容易，满世界找一个人可不那么容易。说不定这个渔民因为担心小男孩，头发已经愁白了，所以老鹰们才没有发现他。你什么都不懂，就知道说。也没见你协助干点儿什么。老鹰们找不到小男孩的舅舅，你也一样找不到，不可能找得到。”

“我不可能找得到？”小狗说，“你就知道这些，你这块愚蠢的热熏肉！我不是还没试过吗？你等着瞧！”

说完，吉普就去找医生说：“请问一下小男孩，看他的口袋里有没有他舅舅的东西，好吗？”

于是医生就去询问小男孩。小男孩拿出来一枚金戒指。因为戒指太大了，他的手指戴不了，他就用一根细绳拴着挂在脖子上。他说，这是眼看海盗追上来时，舅舅给他的。

吉普闻了闻戒指，说：“这毫无用处。问一下他还有没有他舅舅的其他东西。”

这时，小男孩从口袋里掏出了一块漂亮的大红手帕说：“这也是舅舅的。”

小男孩一掏出手帕，吉普就大叫起来：“鼻烟，没错！黑拉皮烟。难道你们没有闻到？他舅舅吸过鼻烟——问问他，医生。”

医生就又问小男孩。小男孩说：“对。我的舅舅吸过好多鼻烟。”“好！”吉普说，“这个人差不多找到了，就像从小猫那儿偷牛奶一样容易。告诉小男孩，不出一个星期，我就能帮他找到舅舅。咱们到上面看看风向吧。”

“可是，天已经黑了，”医生说，“黑灯瞎火的，你找不到他！”

“寻找一个吸黑拉皮烟的人，我不需要任何光线。”吉普一边爬舷梯，一边说道，“如果这个人身上现在的气味一般，比如像绳子或是热水的味道，那就不一样了。可是，鼻烟！啧，啧！”

“热水有气味吗？”医生问道。

“当然有了。”吉普说，“热水闻起来跟冷水完全不一样。如果是温水或冰，那气味的确很难闻到。有一次，我曾在黑夜里尾随一个人走了十英里，就是靠那个人刮胡子用的热水的气味——因为那个可怜的家伙没有香皂……那么，让我们看看风朝哪个方向吹吧。风对远距离闻味至关重要。风力不必太强——当然，风向必须正好。平稳、湿润、宜人的微风最好……哈！风是从北方吹过来的。”

然后，吉普来到船头，迎风闻起了气味，开始喃喃自语：“焦油，西班牙大葱，煤油，湿雨衣，压碎的月桂树叶，燃烧的橡胶，正在洗的花边窗帘——不，我搞错了，是挂在外面晾晒的花边窗帘。还有狐狸，好几百只小狐狸。还有——”

“你真的能在这一种风里闻出所有那些不同的东西吗？”医生问道。

“哎呀，当然能！”吉普说，“那只是几种容易闻到的气味，比较强烈的气味。任何一只杂种狗，即使感冒，也能闻到那些气味。等一下，我要告诉你这风里几种比较难闻出来的气味——几种特别讲究的味道。”

说着，小狗紧紧闭上眼睛，仰起鼻子，半张嘴巴，用劲儿闻了起来。

好一阵子，它都没有说话，像一块石头纹丝不动。它几乎好像不喘气。终于，它开口说话了，听上去简直就像它在梦中伤心地唱着歌儿。

“砖，”它低声说道，声音很低，“老黄砖，在一堵花园的围墙上，因年久而碎裂；从山间小溪里吹来小母牛甜美的气息；正午阳光照射在鸽舍——也许是谷仓——的铅皮顶上；黑色羔皮手套躺在胡桃木做的衣柜抽屉里；一条土路边的悬铃木下面有一个饮水马槽；小蘑菇正从沤烂的树叶里拱出来；还有——还有——还有——”

“有欧洲防风草吗？”珈珈问道。

“没有。”吉普说，“你总是想着吃的。根本没有防风草。而且也没有鼻烟——有好多烟斗和香烟，还有几支雪茄。可是，没有鼻烟。我们必须等风向转南。”

“是，这风向不好。”珈珈说，“我想你是在骗人，吉普。有谁听说过，仅凭嗅觉，就能在茫茫大海中找到一个人啊！我早就说过，你不可能找得到。”

“听着，”吉普说，真的生气了，“你是想让你的鼻子马上被咬上一口吧！你别以为医生不让我们给你应有的惩罚，你就可以这样随心所欲不要脸面！”

“别吵了！”医生说，“住口！生命太短暂了。吉普，告诉我，你觉得，那些气味是从哪儿来的？”

“大多是从德文郡和威尔士来的，”吉普说，“风是从那个方向吹来的。”

“好，好！”医生说，“你知道，这的确非同凡响——非同凡响。我一定要把这记下来，写进我的新书。我不知道你是不是也能把我训练得嗅觉这么好……不过，算了，也许我对我现在的状况更满意。常言说：‘知足常乐。’我们下去吃晚饭吧。我饿极了。”

“我也饿了。”珈珈说。





第十九章　礁石


第二天一早，他们便从丝绸床上爬了起来。他们发现，阳光灿烂，风正从南边吹来。

吉普嗅了半小时南风，然后朝医生走过来，摇了摇头。

“我还是没有闻到鼻烟，”它说，“我们必须等风向转东。”

但是，下午三点钟，东风刮来时，小狗还是闻不到鼻烟的气味。

小男孩失望极了，又开始哭了起来，说好像没有人能帮他找到舅舅了。不过，吉普对医生说的是：“告诉他，等风向转西，只要他的舅舅还吸黑色拉皮鼻烟，即使是远在中国，我也能把他的舅舅给找到。”

他们只好又等了三天，西风才来。星期五一早，天刚刚亮，海面上笼罩着一层薄薄的雨雾，海风轻柔，温暖而湿润。

吉普一醒来，便跑上了甲板，仰起鼻子。随即，它兴奋起来，激动得不得了，飞快地跑下底舱去叫医生。

“医生！”它叫道，“我闻到了！医生！医生！快醒醒！听着！我闻到了！风从西边吹来，只有鼻烟的气味。快上来，开船——快！”

于是，医生慌里慌张，匆匆下床，直奔船舵去开船。

“现在我要上前，”吉普说，“你看着我的鼻子行事，我的鼻子冲哪个方向，你就把船转向哪个方向。气味这么强烈，这个人远不了。风惬意而湿润。现在注意看我！”

所以，整个一上午，吉普站在船头，一边嗅着风，一边指引医生转舵。动物们和小男孩都围着小狗，惊奇地瞪大眼睛，望着它。

大约午饭时分，吉普让嘎嘎告诉医生，说它越来越担心，想对医生说句话。于是，嘎嘎跑去把医生从船的另一头叫了过来。吉普对医生说：“这个男孩的舅舅快饿死了。我们必须尽可能把船开快点儿。”

“你怎么知道他快饿死了呢？”医生问。

“因为风中没有其他的味道，只有鼻烟的气味。”吉普说，“如果这个人在做饭或在吃什么食物，我就肯定也能闻到。他甚至连喝的淡水都没有了。他只有鼻烟可吸，一大捏一大捏地吸。我们越来越接近他，因为鼻烟味越来越浓烈了。不过，你尽可能把船开快点儿，我确信这个人快饿死了。”

“好的。”说着，医生派嘎嘎去请燕子们来拉船，就像上次海盗追赶他们时那样。

于是，顽强的小燕子飞了下来，再一次拽起绳子上路了。

船风驰电掣，破浪前进。海里的鱼只好纷纷跳闪逃命，以免被撞上。

动物们都群情激动，不再看着吉普，而是转身注视起前面的海水，辨认着那个快饿死的人可能待的任何陆地或岛屿。

可是，一个又一个小时过去了，船依然在平坦的海面上继续飞速前进，哪儿也看不到陆地。

此刻，动物们都不再说话，默默地围坐在那儿，焦急难受。小男孩再一次伤心起来。吉普的脸上也有了一丝焦虑。

下午晚些时候，太阳即将落下时，一直卧在桅杆顶上的猫头鹰秃秃突然声嘶力竭大叫起来，把他们都吓了一跳。“吉普！吉普！我看到我们前面有一块很大很大的礁石——瞧——就在海天相连的地方。看到了吧，阳光照在上面，像金子一样！气味就是从那儿来的吧？”

吉普高声回答说：“是的。就是。那个人就在那儿。终于找到了，终于找到了！”

越来越近了，他们可以看到那块礁石非常大，有一大块田地那么大。上面没有长树，也没有长草，什么也没有。这个大礁石像龟背一样平滑光秃。

医生开着船，绕着礁石转了一圈。可是，上面不见一个人。动物们都使劲儿眯着眼睛尽可能地瞅，约翰·杜立德还从舱里拿来了望远镜。

可是，他们连一个活的东西都没有看到——甚至一只海鸥、一只海星、一根海草都没有看到。

他们全都站在那儿，一动不动，使劲儿用耳朵听着声音。可是，他们听到的只有细浪轻轻拍打船帮的声音。

然后，他们都开始喊叫起来：“喂，有人吗？喂！”最后，他们把嗓子都喊哑了。可是，只有礁石的回声。

小男孩突然放声大哭道：“我怕我再也见不到舅舅了！回家可怎么向他们交代呀！”

吉普朝医生喊道：“他肯定在那儿——他肯定——他肯定在！再向前，那气味就没有了。他一定在上面，我告诉你！把船靠近礁石，让我跳上去。”

医生尽可能把船靠近礁石，他放下锚，和吉普一起从船上跳到了礁石上面。

吉普马上鼻子贴着地面，开始四处嗅着。它上上下下，前前后后，弯来绕去，低头转个不停。它走到哪儿，医生就跟到哪儿，寸步不离，直跑得上气不接下气。

终于，吉普大叫一声，卧了下去。医生跑过去，发现小狗正盯着礁石中央一个大深洞看。

“那个男孩的舅舅就在下面。”吉普平静地说道，“难怪那些傻老鹰看不见他！找人还是得让我们狗找。”

医生下到洞里。这好像是一个洞穴或隧道，向地下延伸了很长一段距离。医生划了一根火柴，开始沿着这条黑暗的通道往前走，吉普跟在后面。

火柴不一会儿就灭了，医生只好一根接一根地划燃。

最后，走到了通道尽头，医生发现自己来到了一个四面是石壁的小房间。

只见房间中央躺着一个头发很红的男子，头枕着胳膊，正在酣睡！

吉普走上前，闻了闻那个人身边放着的什么东西。医生弯腰拾了起来。原来是一只很大很大的鼻烟盒，里面装满了黑色拉皮鼻烟！





第二十章　渔民镇


这时，医生轻轻地唤醒那个人。

而就在此刻，火柴又灭了。那个人以为本·阿里又回来了，黑暗中不由分说朝医生抡起了拳头。

但是，当医生告诉他自己是谁，又对他说他的外甥在自己的船上，平安无事，那个人高兴得不得了，并为他刚才动手打医生赔礼道歉。不过，他并没有太伤着医生，因为太黑了，他打得并不准。他给了医生一撮鼻烟。

这个人告诉他们说，因为他不答应当海盗，巴巴里龙就将他扔到这块礁石上不管不问，他常常睡在下面这个洞里，因为礁石上没有供他取暖的房子。

他接着说道：“我已经四天没吃没喝了，一直靠鼻烟活着。”

“就是这样！”吉普说，“我对你说什么来着？”

他们又划燃几根火柴，穿过通道，来到了日光下。医生赶忙把那个人领到船上去喝些汤。

看到医生和吉普带着一个红发男子回到船上，动物们和小男孩又是欢呼又是尖叫，还在船上跳起了舞。上面的燕子也铆足了劲儿吹起了口哨——好几百万只燕子——以此表示它们也很高兴，小男孩的勇敢的舅舅找到了。他们发出的声音如此洪亮，远处海上的水手们还以为一场可怕的暴风雨就要来了呢。“听，大风在东边怒吼！”他们说。

吉普暗自扬扬得意，不过，他尽量不露出骄傲的神情。

嘎嘎走过来，对它说：“吉普，我真不知道，你原来这么聪明！”吉普只是摇了摇头，回答说：“噢，那没什么了不起的。但是，你知道，找人还得需要狗，这种游戏，鸟类根本玩不了。”

这时，医生问红发渔民家住哪儿。渔民如实相告。医生让燕子们在前面领航。

他们来到那个人所说的陆地前，看见石头山脚下有一个不大的渔镇，随后，那个人指出了他居住的房子。

他们正在放锚时，小男孩的妈妈（也就是那个人的姐姐）连哭带笑地从海岸上跑了下来，迎接他们。二十多天来，她一直守在山上，眺望着大海，盼望他们归来。

她一遍又一遍地亲吻着医生，吻得他咯咯直笑，脸红得像个女学生似的。接着，她想去亲吻吉普，但是，吉普拔腿跑开，躲进了船里。

“这样没头没脑地吻个不停，”它说，“我可受不了。如果她一定要亲吻的话，就让她亲吻珈珈去吧。”

渔民和他的姐姐都不想让医生匆匆离开。他们请求他在那儿待上几天。约翰·杜立德和他的动物们只好留下来，在他们家里待了星期六和星期天整整两天，还有星期一的半天。

渔村里所有的小男孩都跑到了海滩上，指着停泊在那儿的那只大船，窃窃私语：“瞧！那原来是海盗船，是本·阿里的，他曾是横行七大洋的最可怕的海盗！那个戴高帽的老先生，就是住在特里威廉太太家的那个人，是他把这船从巴巴里龙手里夺过来的，还让巴巴里龙做了农夫。谁会想到是他，他那么温和，再平凡不过了！瞧那些大红帆！好家伙！这不就是那条样子邪恶、速度又快的船吗？天哪！”

在渔民小镇这两天半的时间里，人们不断请医生去喝茶，吃午饭，吃晚饭，参加聚会；女士们给他送来了一盒又一盒的鲜花和糖果；村乐队每天夜里都会在他的窗下演奏乐曲。

最后，医生说道：“好人们，我现在必须回家了。你们真是太好了，我会永远记住的。可是，我必须回家，因为我还有事儿要做。”

于是，就在医生要准备离开时，镇长沿街走来，一同随行的还有好多身穿盛装的人。镇长在医生住的房前停住脚步，全村人都围拢过来，要看个究竟。

六名小听差对着闪亮的喇叭一吹，人们不再说话了，医生走出房门，来到台阶上。镇长讲起了话。

“约翰·杜立德医生，”他说，“我非常荣幸代表我们可敬的镇民，将这件小小的纪念品献给把巴巴里龙清除出海洋的人，以表谢意。”

说完，镇长从口袋里掏出一个小薄纸包，打开来，把一只非常漂亮、背面镶有真钻石的手表递给了医生。

接着，镇长又从口袋里掏出来一个大一点儿的纸包，说道：“那只狗在哪儿？”

大家赶忙去找吉普。最后，嘎嘎在村子另一头的马场里找到了它。当时村里所有的狗都正围绕它默默地站着，既羡慕又尊敬。

吉普被带到了医生身边，镇长打开那个大纸包，里面是一个纯金做的脖套！镇长弯下腰亲手把项圈戴在了狗的脖子上。这时，村民中响起了好一阵惊叹的低语声。

项圈上写着这样几个大字：“吉普——世界上最聪明的狗。”

之后，整个人群都来到了海边，为他们送行。等到红发渔民、他的姐姐和那个小男孩一次又一次地感谢过医生和他的狗后，这艘挂着红帆的大快船再一次转向泥塘镇方向，驶进了大海，这时村里的乐队在岸上奏起了音乐。





第二十一章　回到家乡


三月的风来了又去，四月的阵雨也已经下过，五月的花蕾早已绽放鲜花，六月的阳光照在喜人的田野上，此时约翰·杜立德终于回到了自己的国家。

可是，他还没有回到泥塘镇的家里。他先用吉卜赛大篷车载着推我拉你全国周游，见着乡村集市就停，一边表演杂技，一边演《庞奇和朱迪》傀儡戏，他们常常挂出一块大招牌，上面写着：“快来看来自非洲丛林的绝妙双头兽。门票六便士。”

推我拉你总是待在大篷车里，其他动物则躺在车下面。医生坐在车前的椅子上，一边收门票，一边向进场的人们报以微笑。嘎嘎总是不忘数落它，说医生总是趁它不留神，免费放孩子们进去。

动物园主和杂技团的人纷纷找到医生，请求他把这只奇异动物卖给他们，说他们会付给他一大笔钱。不过，医生总是摇摇头说：“不行。要把推我拉你关在笼子里，绝对不行。它一向有活动的自由，像你我一样。”

周游期间，他们见了好多奇景怪事。可是，因为刚从国外开过眼界闯荡回来，这些似乎也都变得稀松平常了。一开始参演马戏团那会儿，还非常有趣，可是，几个星期后，他们都厌倦透了，医生和它们全都渴望回家。

但是，好多人都聚集到小篷车跟前来，掏六便士进去看推我拉你，医生马上就不用再做演出经理人了。

在一个天气晴朗、蜀葵花盛开的日子，医生腰缠万贯地回到了泥塘镇。他又住进了带有大花园的那个小房子里。

马厩里那匹老瘸马见到他，非常高兴；那些总在他的屋檐下垒窝孵小鸟的燕子也非常高兴。回到了熟悉的家，嘎嘎很高兴，尽管有大量清扫工作要做，因为到处都是蜘蛛网。

吉普先跑到隔壁，向那只骄傲的牧羊犬炫耀一番它的金项圈。回来后，它便在花园里像疯了一样跑来跑去，又是寻找很久以前自己埋的骨头，又是把老鼠赶出工具房。与此同时，珈珈正忙着在挖花园墙角已经长出三英尺高的山葵。

医生前去看望借给自己船的那位水手，他给他买了两条新船，还给他的小孩子买了一个橡皮娃娃。他也还清了去非洲旅行时欠杂货店主的食品钱。他又买了一架钢琴，把小白鼠放了回去——因为小白鼠们说衣柜抽屉有冷风。

甚至医生装满衣柜上面那只老储钱箱后，还剩有好多钱。他不得不又弄来三个同样大的储钱箱，把剩下的钱放了进去。

“钱，”他说，“可真麻烦。可是，不必为钱发愁也不错。”

“是呀，”嘎嘎说，它正在为医生烘烤当茶点的松饼呢，“的确如此！”

冬天又来了，厨房窗外雪花飞舞。医生和他的动物们吃过晚饭，总是围坐在温暖的大火炉边。他常常给它们朗读他写的那些书。

而在遥远的非洲，猴子们睡觉前，总是习惯在大大的黄月亮下面的棕榈树上闲聊。它们总是说：“我不知道那个好人此刻在那个遥远的白人国做什么！你认为他还会回来吗？”

这时，波利尼西亚常常会从藤蔓植物里尖声回答道：“我认为他一定会——我猜他一定会——我希望他一定会！”

随后，那条鳄鱼也常常会从河里的污泥中抬起头来，冲它们咕哝道：“我相信他一定会——睡觉吧！”

CHAPTER I　PUDDLEBY


ONCE upon a time，many years ago—when our grandfathers were little children—there was a doctor，and his name was Dolittle—John Dolittle，M．D．“M．D．”means that he was a proper doctor and knew a whole lot．

He lived in a little town called，Puddleby-on-the-Marsh．All the folks，young and old，knew him well by sight．And whenever he walked down the street in his high hat everyone would say，“There goes the Doctor！He's a clever man．”And the dogs and the children would all run up and follow behind him；and even the crows that lived in the church tower would caw and nod their heads．

The house he lived in，on the edge of the town，was quite small，but his garden was very large and had a wide lawn and stone seats and weeping willows hanging over．His sister，Sarah Dolittle，was housekeeper for him，but the Doctor looked after the garden himself．

He was very fond of animals and kept many kinds of pets．Besides the goldfish in the pond at the bottom of his garden，he had rabbits in the pantry，white mice in his piano，a squirrel in the linen closet，and a hedgehog in the cellar．He had a cow with a calf too，and an old lame horse—twenty-five years of age—and chickens，and pigeons，and two lambs，and many other animals．But his favorite pets were Dab-Dab the duck，Jip the dog，Gub-Gub the baby pig，Polynesia the parrot，and the owl Too-Too．

His sister used to grumble about all these animals and said they made the house untidy．And one day when an old lady with rheumatism came to see the Doctor，she sat on the hedgehog who was sleeping on the sofa and never came to see him any more，but drove every Saturday all the way to Oxenthorpe，another town ten miles off，to see a different doctor．

Then his sister，Sarah Dolittle，came to him and said，“John，how can you expect sick people to come and see you when you keep all these animals in the house？It's a fine doctor would have his parlor full of hedgehogs and mice！That's the fourth person these animals have driven away．Squire Jenkins and the Parson say they wouldn't come near your house again—no matter how sick they are．We are getting poorer every day．If you go on like this，none of the best people will have you for a doctor．”

“But I like the animals better than the‘best people，’”said the Doctor．

“You are ridiculous，”said his sister，and walked out of the room．

So，as time went on，the Doctor got more and more animals，and the people who came to see him got less and less．Till at last he had no one left—except the Cat's-meat-Man，who didn't mind any kind of animals．But the Cat's-meat-Man wasn't very rich and he only got sick once a year—at Christmas time，when he used to give the Doctor sixpence for a bottle of medicine．

Sixpence a year wasn't enough to live on—even in those days long ago；and if the Doctor hadn't had some money saved up in his money-box，no one knows what would have happened．

And he kept on getting still more pets，and of course it cost a lot to feed them．And the money he had saved up grew littler and littler．

Then he sold his piano，and let the mice live in a bureau drawer．But the money he got for that too began to go，so he sold the brown suit he wore on Sundays and went on becoming poorer and poorer．

And now，when he walked down the street in his high hat，people would say to one another，“There goes John Dolittle，M．D．！There was a time when he was the best-known doctor in the West Country—Look at him now—He hasn't any money and his stockings are full of holes！”

But the dogs and the cats and the children still ran up and followed him through the town—the same as they had done when he was rich．





CHAPTER II　ANIMAL LANGUAGE


IT happened one day that the Doctor was sitting in his kitchen talking with the Cat's-meat-Man who had come to see him with a stomachache．

“Why don't you give up being a people's doctor，and be an animal doctor？”asked the Cat's-meat-Man．

The parrot，Polynesia，was sitting in the window looking out at the rain and singing a sailor-song to herself．She stopped singing and started to listen．

“You see，Doctor，”the Cat's-meat-Man went on，“you know all about animals—much more than what these here vets do．That book you wrote about cats—why，it's wonderful！I can't read or write myself，or maybe I'D write some books．But my wife，Theodosia，she's a scholar，she is．And she read your book to me．Well，it's wonderful—that's all can be said—wonderful．You might have been a cat yourself．You know the way they think．And listen：you can make a lot of money doctoring animals．Do you know that？You see，I'd send all the old women who had sick cats or dogs to you．And if they didn't get sick fast enough，I could put something in the meat I sell 'em to make 'em sick，see？”

“Oh，no，”said the Doctor quickly．“You mustn't do that．That wouldn't be right．”

“Oh，I didn't mean real sick，”answered the Cat's-meat-Man．“Just a little something to make them droopy-like was what I had reference to．But as you say，maybe it ain't quite fair on the animals．But they'll get sick anyway，because the old women always give 'em too much to eat．And look，all the farmers 'round about who had lame horses and weak lambs—they'd come．Be an animal doctor．”

When the Cat's-meat-Man had gone the parrot flew off the window onto the Doctor's table and said，“That man's got sense．That's what you ought to do．Be an animal doctor．Give the silly people up—if they haven't brains enough to see you're the best doctor in the world．Take care of animals instead．THEY'll soon find it out．Be an animal doctor．”

“Oh，there are plenty of animal doctors，”said John Dolittle，putting the flower pots outside on the windowsill to get the rain．

“Yes，there ARE plenty，”said Polynesia．“But none of them are any good at all．Now listen，Doctor，and I'll tell you something．Did you know that animals can talk？”

“I knew that parrots can talk，”said the Doctor．

“Oh，we parrots can talk in two languages—people's language and bird language，”said Polynesia proudly．“If I say，‘Polly wants a cracker，’you understand me．But hear this：Ka-ka oi-ee，fee-fee？”

“Good gracious！”cried the Doctor．“What does that mean？”

“That means，‘Is the porridge hot yet？’—in bird language．”

“My！You don't say so！”said the Doctor．“You never talked that way to me before．”

“What would have been the good？”said Polynesia，dusting some cracker crumbs off her left wing．“You wouldn't have understood me if I had．”

“Tell me some more，”said the Doctor，all excited，and he rushed over to the dresser drawer and came back with the butcher's book and a pencil．“Now，don't go too fast and I'll write it down．This is interesting，very interesting—something quite new．Give me the Birds' ABC first—slowly，now．”

So that was the way the Doctor came to know that animals had a language of their own and could talk to one another．And all that afternoon，while it was raining，Polynesia sat on the kitchen table giving him bird words to put down in the book．

At teatime，when the dog，Jip，came in，the parrot said to the Doctor，“See，HE's talking to you．”

“Looks to me as though he were scratching his ear，”said the Doctor．

“But animals don't always speak with their mouths，”said the parrot in a high voice，raising her eyebrows．“They talk with their ears，with their feet，with their tails—with everything．Sometimes they don't WANT to make a noise．Do you see now the way he's twitching up one side of his nose？”

“What's that mean？”asked the Doctor．

“That means，‘Can't you see that it has stopped raining？’”Polynesia answered．“He is asking you a question．Dogs nearly always use their noses for asking questions．”

After a while，with the parrot's help，the Doctor got to learn the language of the animals so well that he could talk to them himself and understand everything they said．Then he gave up being a people's doctor altogether．

As soon as the Cat's-meat-Man had told every one that John Dolittle was going to become an animal doctor，old ladies began to bring him their pet pugs and poodles who had eaten too much cake，and farmers came many miles to show him sick cows and sheep．

One day a plow horse was brought to him，and the poor thing was terribly glad to find a man who could talk in horse language．

“You know，Doctor，”said the horse，“that vet over the hill knows nothing at all．He has been treating me six weeks now—for spavins．What I need is SPECTACLES．I am going blind in one eye．There's no reason why horses shouldn't wear glasses the same as people．But that stupid man over the hill never even looked at my eyes．He kept on giving me big pills．I tried to tell him，but he couldn't understand a word of horse language．What I need is spectacles．”

“Of course，of course，”said the Doctor．“I'll get you some at once．”

“I would like a pair like yours，”said the horse，“only green．They'll keep the sun out of my eyes while I'm plowing the Fifty-Acre Field．”

“Certainly，”said the Doctor．“Green ones you shall have．”

“You know，the trouble is，Sir，”said the plow horse as the Doctor opened the front door to let him out，“the trouble is that ANYBODY thinks he can doctor animals，just because the animals don't complain．As a matter of fact it takes a much cleverer man to be a really good animal doctor than it does to be a good people's doctor．My farmer's boy thinks he knows all about horses．I wish you could see him．His face is so fat he looks as though he had no eyes，and he has got as much brain as a potato bug．He tried to put a mustard plaster on me last week．”

“Where did he put it？”asked the Doctor．

“Oh，he didn't put it anywhere—on me，”said the horse．“He only tried to．I kicked him into the duck pond．”

“Well，well！”said the Doctor．

“I'm a pretty quiet creature as a rule，”said the horse，“very patient with people，don't make much fuss．But it was bad enough to have that vet giving me the wrong medicine．And when that red-faced booby started to monkey with me，I just couldn't bear it anymore．”

“Did you hurt the boy much？”asked the Doctor．

“Oh，no，”said the horse．“I kicked him in the right place．The vet's looking after him now．When will my glasses be ready？”

“I'll have them for you next week，”said the Doctor．“Come in again Tuesday．Good morning！”

Then John Dolittle got a fine big pair of green spectacles，and the plow horse stopped going blind in one eye and could see as well as ever．

And soon it became a common sight to see farm animals wearing glasses in the country around Puddleby，and a blind horse was a thing unknown．

And so it was with all the other animals that were brought to him．As soon as they found that he could talk their language，they told him where the pain was and how they felt，and of course it was easy for him to cure them．

Now all these animals went back and told their brothers and friends that there was a doctor in the little house with the big garden who really WAS a doctor．And whenever any creatures got sick—not only horses and cows and dogs，but all the little things of the fields，like harvest mice and water voles，badgers and bats，they came at once to his house on the edge of the town，so that his big garden was nearly always crowded with animals trying to get in to see him．

There were so many that came that he had to have special doors made for the different kinds．He wrote HORSES over the front door，COWS over the side door，and SHEEP on the kitchen door．Each kind of animal had a separate door—even the mice had a tiny tunnel made for them into the cellar，where they waited patiently in rows for the Doctor to come around to them．

And so，in a few years' time，every living thing for miles and miles got to know about John Dolittle，M．D．And the birds who flew to other countries in the winter told the animals in foreign lands of the wonderful doctor of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh，who could understand their talk and help them in their troubles．In this way he became famous among the animals—all over the world—better known even than he had been among the folks of the West Country．And he was happy and liked his life very much．

One afternoon when the Doctor was busy writing in a book，Polynesia sat in the window，as she nearly always did，looking out at the leaves blowing about in the garden．Presently she laughed aloud．

“What is it，Polynesia？”asked the Doctor，looking up from his book．

“I was just thinking，”said the parrot，and she went on looking at the leaves．

“What were you thinking？”

“I was thinking about people，”said Polynesia．“People make me sick．They think they're so wonderful．The world has been going on now for thousands of years，hasn't it？And the only thing in animal language that PEOPLE have learned to understand is that when a dog wags his tail he means‘I'm glad！’It's funny，isn't it？You are the very first man to talk like us．Oh，sometimes people annoy me dreadfully—such airs they put on—talking about‘the dumb animals．’DUMB！Huh！Why I knew a macaw once who could say‘Good morning！’in seven different ways without once opening his mouth．He could talk every language—and Greek．An old professor with a gray beard bought him．But he didn't stay．He said the old man didn't talk Greek right，and he couldn't stand listening to him teach the language wrong．I often wonder what's become of him．That bird knew more geography than people will ever know．PEOPLE！Golly！I suppose if people ever learn to fly—like any common hedge sparrow—we shall never hear the end of it！”

“You're a wise old bird，”said the Doctor．“How old are you really？I know that parrots and elephants sometimes live to be very，very old．”

“I can never be quite sure of my age，”said Polynesia．“It's either a hundred and eighty-three or a hundred and eighty-two．But I know that when I first came here from Africa，King Charles was still hiding in the oak tree—because I saw him．He looked scared to death．”





CHAPTER III　MORE MONEY TROUBLES


AND soon now the Doctor began to make money again，and his sister，Sarah，bought a new dress and was happy．Some of the animals who came to see him were so sick that they had to stay at the Doctor's house for a week．And when they were getting better they used to sit in chairs on the lawn．

And often even after they got well，they did not want to go away—they liked the Doctor and his house so much．And he never had the heart to refuse them when they asked if they could stay with him．So in this way he went on getting more and more pets．

Once when he was sitting on his garden wall，smoking a pipe in the evening，an Italian organ-grinder came around with a monkey on a string．The Doctor saw at once that the monkey's collar was too tight and that he was dirty and unhappy．So he took the monkey away from the Italian，gave the man a shilling and told him to go．The organ-grinder got awfully angry and said that he wanted to keep the monkey．But the Doctor told him that if he didn't go away he would punch him on the nose．John Dolittle was a strong man，though he wasn't very tall．So the Italian went away saying rude things，and the monkey stayed with Doctor Dolittle and had a good home．The other animals in the house called him Chee-Chee，which is a common word in monkey language，meaning “ginger．”

And another time，when the circus came to Puddleby，the crocodile who had a bad tooth-ache escaped at night and came into the Doctor's garden．The Doctor talked to him in crocodile language and took him into the house and made his tooth better．But when the crocodile saw what a nice house it was，with all the different places for the different kinds of animals，he too wanted to live with the Doctor．He asked if he could sleep in the fish pond at the bottom of the garden，if he promised not to eat the fish．When the circus men came to take him back he got so wild and savage that he frightened them away．But to everyone in the house he was always as gentle as a kitten．

But now the old ladies grew afraid to send their lapdogs to Doctor Dolittle because of the crocodile，and the farmers wouldn't believe that he would not eat the lambs and sick calves they brought to be cured．So the Doctor went to the crocodile and told him he must go back to his circus．But he wept such big tears，and begged so hard to be allowed to stay that the Doctor hadn't the heart to turn him out．

So then the Doctor's sister came to him and said，“John，you must send that creature away．Now the farmers and the old ladies are afraid to send their animals to you，just as we were beginning to be well off again．Now we shall be ruined entirely．This is the last straw．I will no longer be housekeeper for you if you don't send away that alligator．”

“It isn't an alligator，”said the Doctor，“it's a crocodile．”

“I don't care what you call it，”said his sister．“It's a nasty thing to find under the bed．I won't have it in the house．”

“But he has promised me，”the Doctor answered，“that he will not bite anyone．He doesn't like the circus，and I haven't the money to send him back to Africa，where he comes from．He minds his own business and on the whole is very well behaved．Don't be so fussy．”

“I tell you I WILL NOT have him around，”said Sarah．“He eats the linoleum．If you don't send him away this minute I'll—I'll go and get married！”

“All right，”said the Doctor，“go and get married．It can't be helped．”And he took down his hat and went out into the garden．

So Sarah Dolittle packed up her things and went off；and the Doctor was left all alone with his animal family．

And very soon he was poorer than he had ever been before．With all these mouths to fill，and the house to look after，and no one to do the mending，and no money coming in to pay the butcher's bill，things began to look very difficult．But the Doctor didn't worry at all．

“Money is a nuisance，”he used to say．“We'd all be much better off if it had never been invented．What does money matter，so long as we are happy？”

But soon the animals themselves began to get worried．And one evening when the Doctor was asleep in his chair before the kitchen fire，they began talking it over among themselves in whispers．And the owl，Too-Too，who was good at arithmetic，figured it out that there was money enough left to last only another week—if they each had one meal a day and no more．

Then the parrot said，“I think we all ought to do the housework ourselves．At least we can do that much．After all，it is for our sakes that the old man finds himself so lonely and so poor．”

So it was agreed that the monkey，Chee-Chee，was to do the cooking and mending；the dog was to sweep the floors；the duck was to dust and make the beds；the owl，Too-Too，was to keep the accounts，and the pig was to do the gardening．They made Polynesia，the parrot，housekeeper and laundress，because she was the oldest．

Of course at first they all found their new jobs very hard to do—all except Chee-Chee，who had hands，and could do things like a man．But they soon got used to it；and they used to think it great fun to watch Jip，the dog，sweeping his tail over the floor with a rag tied onto it for a broom．After a little，they got to do the work so well that the Doctor said that he had never had his house kept so tidy or so clean before．

In this way things went along all right for a while，but without money they found it very hard．

Then the animals made a vegetable and flower stall outside the garden gate and sold radishes and roses to the people that passed by along the road．

But still they didn't seem to make enough money to pay all the bills—and still the Doctor wouldn't worry．When the parrot came to him and told him that the fishmonger wouldn't give them any more fish，he said，“Never mind．So long as the hens lay eggs and the cow gives milk we can have omelettes and junket．And there are plenty of vegetables left in the garden．The Winter is still a long way off．Don't fuss．That was the trouble with Sarah—she would fuss．I wonder how Sarah's getting on．An excellent woman—in some ways．Well，well！”

But the snow came earlier than usual that year．And although the old lame horse hauled in plenty of wood from the forest outside the town，so they could have a big fire in the kitchen，most of the vegetables in the garden were gone，and the rest were covered with snow．And many of the animals were really hungry．





CHAPTER IV　A MESSAGE FROM AFRICA


THAT Winter was a very cold one．And one night in December，when they were all sitting around the warm fire in the kitchen，and the Doctor was reading aloud to them out of books he had written himself in animal language，the owl，Too-Too，suddenly said，“Sh！What's that noise outside？”

They all listened，and presently they heard the sound of some one running．Then the door flew open and the monkey，Chee-Chee，ran in，badly out of breath．

“Doctor！”he cried，“I've just had a message from a cousin of mine in Africa．There is a terrible sickness among the monkeys out there．They are all catching it—and they are dying in hundreds．They have heard of you，and beg you to come to Africa to stop the sickness．”

“Who brought the message？”asked the Doctor，taking off his spectacles and laying down his book．

“A swallow，”said Chee-Chee．“She is outside on the rain butt．”

“Bring her in by the fire，”said the Doctor．“She must be perished with the cold．The swallows flew south six weeks ago！”

So the swallow was brought in，all huddled and shivering；and although she was a little afraid at first，she soon got warmed up and sat on the edge of the mantelpiece and began to talk．

When she had finished the Doctor said，“I would gladly go to Africa—especially in this bitter weather．But I'm afraid we haven't money enough to buy the tickets．Get me the money box，Chee-Chee．”

So the monkey climbed up and got it off the top shelf of the dresser．

There was nothing in it—not one single penny！

“I felt sure there was twopence left，”said the Doctor．

“There WAS，”said the owl．“But you spent it on a rattle for that badger's baby when he was teething．”

“Did I？”said the Doctor．“Dear me，dear me！What a nuisance money is，to be sure！Well，never mind．Perhaps if I go down to the seaside I shall be able to borrow a boat that will take us to Africa．I knew a seaman once who brought his baby to me with measles．Maybe he'll lend us his boat—the baby got well．”

So early the next morning the Doctor went down to the seashore．And when he came back he told the animals it was all right—the sailor was going to lend them the boat．

Then the crocodile and the monkey and the parrot were very glad and began to sing，because they were going back to Africa，their real home．

And the Doctor said，“I shall only be able to take you three—with Jip the dog，Dab-Dab the duck，Gub-Gub the pig，and the owl，Too-Too．The rest of the animals，like the dormice and the water voles and the bats，they will have to go back and live in the fields where they were born till we come home again．But as most of them sleep through the winter，they won't mind that．And besides，it wouldn't be good for them to go to Africa．”

So then the parrot，who had been on long sea voyages before，began telling the Doctor all the things he would have to take with him on the ship．

“You must have plenty of pilot bread，”she said，“‘hardtack’they call it．And you must have beef in cans—and an anchor．”

“I expect the ship will have its own anchor，”said the Doctor．

“Well，make sure，”said Polynesia．“Because it's very important．You can't stop if you haven't got an anchor．And you'll need a bell．”

“What's that for？”asked the Doctor．

“To tell the time by，”said the parrot．“You go and ring it every half hour，and then you know what time it is．And bring a whole lot of rope—it always comes in handy on voyages．”

Then they began to wonder where they were going to get the money from to buy all the things they needed．

“Oh，bother it！Money again，”cried the Doctor．“Goodness！I shall be glad to get to Africa where we don't have to have any！I'll go and ask the grocer if he will wait for his money till I get back．No，I'll send the sailor to ask him．”

So the sailor went to see the grocer．And presently he came back with all the things they wanted．

Then the animals packed up；and after they had turned off the water so the pipes wouldn't freeze，and put up the shutters，they closed the house and gave the key to the old horse who lived in the stable．And when they had seen that there was plenty of hay in the loft to last the horse through the winter，they carried all their luggage down to the seashore and got on to the boat．

The Cat's-meat-Man was there to see them off；and he brought a large suet pudding as a present for the Doctor because，he said he had been told，you couldn't get suet puddings in foreign parts．

As soon as they were on the ship，Gub-Gub，the pig，asked where the beds were，for it was four o'clock in the afternoon and he wanted his nap．So Polynesia took him downstairs into the inside of the ship and showed him the beds，set all on top of one another like bookshelves against a wall．

“Why，that isn't a bed！”cried Gub-Gub．“That's a shelf！”

“Beds are always like that on ships，”said the parrot．“It isn't a shelf．Climb up into it and go to sleep．That's what you call a‘bunk．’”

“I don't think I'll go to bed yet，”said Gub-Gub．“I'm too excited．I want to go upstairs again and see them start．”

“Well，this is your first trip，”said Polynesia．“You will get used to the life after a while．”

And she went back up the stairs of the ship，humming this song to herself：

I've seen the Black Sea and the Red Sea；

I rounded the Isle of Wight；

I discovered the Yellow River，

And the Orange too by night．

Now Greenland drops behind again，

And I sail the ocean Blue．

I'm tired of all these colors，Jane，

So I'm coming back to you．

They were just going to start on their journey，when the Doctor said he would have to go back and ask the sailor the way to Africa．

But the swallow said she had been to that continent many times and would show them how to get there．

So the Doctor told Chee-Chee to pull up the anchor and the voyage began．





CHAPTER V　THE GREAT JOURNEY


NOW for six whole weeks they went sailing on and on，over the rolling sea，following the swallow who flew before the ship to show them the way．At night she carried a tiny lantern，so they should not miss her in the dark；and the people on the other ships that passed said that the light must be a shooting star．

As they sailed further and further into the south，it got warmer and warmer．Polynesia，Chee-Chee and the crocodile enjoyed the hot sun no end．They ran about laughing and looking over the side of the ship to see if they could see Africa yet．

But the pig and the dog and the owl，Too-Too，could do nothing in such weather，but sat at the end of the ship in the shade of a big barrel，with their tongues hanging out，drinking lemonade．

Dab-Dab，the duck，used to keep herself cool by jumping into the sea and swimming behind the ship．And every once in a while，when the top of her head got too hot，she would dive under the ship and come up on the other side．In this way，too，she used to catch herrings on Tuesdays and Fridays，when everybody on the boat ate fish to make the beef last longer．

When they got near to the equator they saw some flying fishes coming towards them．And the fishes asked the parrot if this was Doctor Dolittle's ship．When she told them it was，they said they were glad，because the monkeys in Africa were getting worried that he would never ome．Polynesia asked them how many miles they had yet to go，and the flying fishes said it was only fifty-five miles now to the coast of Africa．

And another time a whole school of porpoises came dancing through the waves，and they too asked Polynesia if this was the ship of the famous doctor．And when they heard that it was，they asked the parrot if the Doctor wanted anything for his journey．

And Polynesia said，“Yes．We have run short of onions．”

“There is an island not far from here，”said the porpoises，“where the wild onions grow tall and strong．Keep straight on—we will get some and catch up to you．”

So the porpoises dashed away through the sea．And very soon the parrot saw them again，coming up behind，dragging the onions through the waves in big nets made of seaweed．

The next evening，as the sun was going down，the Doctor said，“Get me the telescope，Chee-Chee．Our journey is nearly ended．Very soon we should be able to see the shores of Africa．”

And about half an hour later，sure enough，they thought they could see something in front that might be land．But it began to get darker and darker and they couldn't be sure．

Then a great storm came up，with thunder and lightning．The wind howled，the rain came down in torrents，and the waves got so high，they splashed right over the boat．

Presently there was a big BANG！The ship stopped and rolled over on its side．

“What's happened？”asked the Doctor，coming up from downstairs．

“I'm not sure，”said the parrot，“but I think we're shipwrecked．Tell the duck to get out and see．”

So Dab-Dab dived right down under the waves．And when she came up she said they had struck a rock；there was a big hole in the bottom of the ship，the water was coming in；and they were sinking fast．

“We must have run into Africa，”said the Doctor．“Dear me，dear me！Well，we must all swim to land．”

But Chee-Chee and Gub-Gub did not know how to swim．

“Get the rope！”said Polynesia．“I told you it would come in handy．Where's that duck？Come here，Dab-Dab．Take this end of the rope，fly to the shore and tie it onto a palm-tree；and we'll hold the other end on the ship here．Then those that can't swim must climb along the rope till they reach the land．That's what you call a‘life-line．’”

So they all got safely to the shore—some swimming，some flying；and those that climbed along the rope brought the Doctor's trunk and handbag with them．

But the ship was no good anymore，with the big hole in the bottom；and presently the rough sea beat it to pieces on the rocks and the timbers floated away．

Then they all took shelter in a nice dry cave they found high up in the cliffs，till the storm was over．

When the sun came out next morning they went down to the sandy beach to dry themselves．

“Dear old Africa！”sighed Polynesia．“It's good to get back．Just think—it'll be a hundred and sixty-nine years tomorrow since I was here！And it hasn't changed a bit！Same old palm trees，same old red earth，same old black ants！There's no place like home！”

And the others noticed she had tears in her eyes—she was so pleased to see her old home once again．

Then the Doctor missed his high hat，for it had been blown into the sea during the storm．So Dab-Dab went out to look for it．And presently she saw it a long way off，floating on the water like a toy boat．

When she flew down to get it，she found one of the white mice，very frightened，sitting inside it．

“What are you doing here？”asked the duck．“You were told to stay behind in Puddleby．”

“I didn't want to be left behind，”said the mouse．“I wanted to see what Africa was like—I have relatives there．So I hid in the baggage and was brought onto the ship with the hard tack．When the ship sank I was terribly frightened because I cannot swim far．I swam as long as I could，but I soon got all exhausted and thought I was going to sink．And then，just at that moment，the old man's hat came floating by，and I got into it because I did not want to be drowned．”

So the duck took up the hat with the mouse in it and brought it to the Doctor on the shore．And they all gathered around to have a look．

“That's what you call a‘stowaway，’”said the parrot．

Presently，when they were looking for a place in the trunk where the white mouse could travel comfortably，the monkey，Chee-Chee，suddenly said，“Sh！I hear footsteps in the jungle！”

They all stopped talking and listened．And soon a black man came down out of the woods and asked them what they were doing there．

“My name is John Dolittle—M．D．，”said the Doctor．“I have been asked to come to Africa to cure the monkeys who are sick．”

“You must all come before the King，”said the black man．

“What king？”asked the Doctor，who didn't want to waste any time．

“The King of the Jolliginki，”the man answered．“All these lands belong to him；and all strangers must be brought before him．Follow me．”

So they gathered up their baggage and went off，following the man through the jungle．





CHAPTER VI　POLYNESIA AND THE KING


WHEN they had gone a little way through the thick forest they came to a wide，clear space，and they saw the King's palace which was made of mud．

This was where the King lived with his Queen，Ermintrude，and their son，Prince Bumpo．The Prince was away fishing for salmon in the river．But the King and Queen were sitting under an umbrella before the palace door．And Queen Ermintrude was asleep．

When the Doctor had come up to the palace the King asked him his business，and the Doctor told him why he had come to Africa．

“You may not travel through my lands，”said the King．“Many years ago a white man came to these shores；and I was very kind to him．But after he had dug holes in the ground to get the gold，and killed all the elephants to get their ivory tusks，he went away secretly in his ship—without so much as saying‘Thank you．’Never again shall a white man travel through the lands of Jolliginki．”

Then the King turned to some of the black men who were standing near and said，“Take away this medicine man with all his animals，and lock them up in my strongest prison．”

So six of the black men led the Doctor and all his pets away and shut them up in a stone dungeon．The dungeon had only one little window，high up in the wall，with bars in it；and the door was strong and thick．

Then they all grew very sad，and Gub-Gub，the pig，began to cry．But Chee-Chee said he would spank him if he didn't stop that horrible noise，and he kept quiet．

“Are we all here？”asked the Doctor，after he had got used to the dim light．

“Yes，I think so，”said the duck and started to count them．

“Where's Polynesia？”asked the crocodile．“She isn't here．”

“Are you sure？”said the Doctor．“Look again．Polynesia！Polynesia！Where are you？”

“I suppose she escaped，”grumbled the crocodile．“Well，that's just like her！Sneaked off into the jungle as soon as her friends got into trouble．”

“I'm not that kind of a bird，”said the parrot，climbing out of the pocket in the tail of the Doctor's coat．“You see，I'm small enough to get through the bars of that window，and I was afraid they would put me in a cage instead．So while the King was busy talking，I hid in the Doctor's pocket—and here I am！That's what you call a‘ruse，’”she said，smoothing down her feathers with her beak．

“Good gracious！”cried the Doctor．“You're lucky I didn't sit on you．”

“Now listen，”said Polynesia，“tonight，as soon as it gets dark，I am going to creep through the bars of that window and fly over to the palace．And then—you'll see—I'll soon find a way to make the King let us all out of prison．”

“Oh，what can YOU do？”said Gub-Gub，turning up his nose and beginning to cry again．“You're only a bird！”

“Quite true，”said the parrot．“But do not forget that although I am only a bird，I CAN TALK LIKE A MAN—and I know these people．”

So that night，when the moon was shining through the palm trees and all the King's men were asleep，the parrot slipped out through the bars of the prison and flew across to the palace．The pantry window had been broken by a tennis ball the week before；and Polynesia popped in through the hole in the glass．

She heard Prince Bumpo snoring in his bedroom at the back of the palace．Then she tiptoed up the stairs till she came to the King's bedroom．She opened the door gently and peeped in．

The Queen was away at a dance that night at her cousin's，but the King was in bed fast asleep．

Polynesia crept in very softly，and got under the bed．

Then she coughed—just the way Doctor Dolittle used to cough．Polynesia could mimic anyone．

The King opened his eyes and said sleepily：“Is that you，Ermintrude？”（He thought it was the Queen come back from the dance．）

Then the parrot coughed again—loud，like a man．And the King sat up wide awake and said，“Who's that？”

“I am Doctor Dolittle，”said the parrot—just the way the Doctor would have said it．

“What are you doing in my bedroom？”cried the King．“How dare you get out of prison！Where are you？I don't see you．”

But the parrot just laughed—a long，deep，jolly laugh，like the Doctor's．

“Stop laughing and come here at once，so I can see you，”said the King．

“Foolish King！”answered Polynesia．“Have you forgotten that you are talking to John Dolittle，M．D．—the most wonderful man on earth？Of course you cannot see me．I have made myself invisible．There is nothing I cannot do．Now listen：I have come here tonight to warn you．If you don't let me and my animals travel through your kingdom，I will make you and all your people sick like the monkeys．For I can make people well，and I can make people ill—just by raising my little finger．Send your soldiers at once to open the dungeon door，or you shall have mumps before the morning sun has risen on the hills of Jolliginki．”

Then the King began to tremble and was very much afraid．

“Doctor，”he cried，“it shall be as you say．Do not raise your little finger，please！”And he jumped out of bed and ran to tell the soldiers to open the prison door．

As soon as he was gone，Polynesia crept downstairs and left the palace by the pantry window．

But the Queen，who was just letting herself in at the backdoor with a latchkey，saw the parrot getting out through the broken glass．And when the King came back to bed，she told him what she had seen．

Then the King understood that he had been tricked，and he was dreadfully angry．He hurried back to the prison at once．

But he was too late．The door stood open．The dungeon was empty．The Doctor and all his animals were gone．





CHAPTER VII　THE BRIDGE OF APES


QUEEN ERMINTRUDE had never in her life seen her husband so terrible as he got that night．He gnashed his teeth with rage．He called everybody a fool．He threw his tooth brush at the palace cat．He rushed around in his night shirt and woke up all his army and sent them into the jungle to catch the Doctor．Then he made all his servants go too—his cooks and his gardeners and his barber and Prince Bumpo's tutor．Even the Queen，who was tired from dancing in a pair of tight shoes，was packed off to help the soldiers in their search．

All this time the Doctor and his animals were running through the forest towards the Land of the Monkeys as fast as they could go．

Gub-Gub，with his short legs，soon got tired，and the Doctor had to carry him，which made it pretty hard when they had the trunk and the handbag with them as well．

The King of the Jolliginki thought it would be easy for his army to find them，because the Doctor was in a strange land and would not know his way．But he was wrong，because the monkey，Chee-Chee，knew all the paths through the jungle—better even than the King's men did．And he led the Doctor and his pets to the very thickest part of the forest，a place where no man had ever been before，and hid them all in a big hollow tree between high rocks．

“We had better wait here，”said Chee-Chee，“till the soldiers have gone back to bed．Then we can go on into the Land of the Monkeys．”

So there they stayed the whole night through．

They often heard the King's men searching and talking in the jungle around about．But they were quite safe，for no one knew of that hiding-place but Chee-Chee—not even the other monkeys．

At last，when daylight began to come through the thick leaves overhead，they heard Queen Ermintrude saying in a very tired voice that it was no use looking anymore—that they might as well go back and get some sleep．

As soon as the soldiers had all gone home，Chee-Chee brought the Doctor and his animals out of the hiding place and they set off for the Land of the Monkeys．

It was a long，long way，and they often got very tired—especially Gub-Gub．But when he cried they gave him milk out of the cocoanuts，which he was very fond of．

They always had plenty to eat and drink，because Chee-Chee and Polynesia knew all the different kinds of fruits and vegetables that grow in the jungle，and where to find them—like dates and figs and groundnuts and ginger and yams．They used to make their lemonade out of the juice of wild oranges，sweetened with honey which they got from the bees' nests in hollow trees．No matter what it was they asked for，Chee-Chee and Polynesia always seemed to be able to get it for them—or something like it．They even got the Doctor some tobacco one day，when he had finished what he had brought with him and wanted to smoke．

At night they slept in tents made of palm leaves，on thick，soft beds of dried grass．And after a while they got used to walking such a lot and did not get so tired and enjoyed the life of travel very much．

But they were always glad when the night came and they stopped for their resting time．Then the Doctor used to make a little fire of sticks；and after they had had their supper，they would sit round it in a ring，listening to Polynesia singing songs about the sea，or to Chee-Chee telling stories of the jungle．

And many of the tales that Chee-Chee told were very interesting．Because although the monkeys had no history books of their own before Doctor Dolittle came to write them for them，they remember everything that happens by telling stories to their children．And Chee-Chee spoke of many things his grandmother had told him—tales of long，long，long ago，before Noah and the Flood—of the days when men dressed in bear skins and lived in holes in the rock and ate their mutton raw，because they did not know what cooking was，never having seen a fire．And he told them of the Great Mammoths and Lizards，as long as a train，that wandered over the mountains in those times，nibbling from the treetops．And often they got so interested listening，that when he had finished they found their fire had gone right out，and they had to scurry round to get more sticks and build a new one．

Now when the King's army had gone back and told the King that they couldn't find the Doctor，the King sent them out again and told them they must stay in the jungle till they caught him．So all this time，while the Doctor and his animals were going along towards the Land of the Monkeys，thinking themselves quite safe，they were still being followed by the King's men．If Chee-Chee had known this，he would most likely have hidden them again．But he didn't know it．

One day Chee-Chee climbed up a high rock and looked out over the treetops．And when he came down he said they were now quite close to the Land of the Monkeys and would soon be there．

And that same evening，sure enough，they saw Chee-Chee's cousin and a lot of other monkeys，who had not yet got sick，sitting in the trees by the edge of a swamp，looking and waiting for them．And when they saw the famous doctor really come，these monkeys made a tremendous noise，cheering and waving leaves and swinging out of the branches to greet him．

They wanted to carry his bag and his trunk and everything he had．And one of the bigger ones even carried Gub-Gub，who had got tired again．Then two of them rushed on in front to tell the sick monkeys that the great doctor had come at last．

But the King's men，who were still following，had heard the noise of the monkeys cheering，and they at last knew where the Doctor was，and hastened on to catch him．

The big monkey carrying Gub-Gub was coming along behind slowly，and he saw the Captain of the army sneaking through the trees．So he hurried after the Doctor and told him to run．

Then they all ran harder than they had ever run in their lives，and the King's men，coming after them，began to run too，and the Captain ran hardest of all．

Then the Doctor tripped over his medicine bag and fell down in the mud，and the Captain thought he would surely catch him this time．

But the Captain had very long ears，though his hair was very short．And as he sprang forward to take hold of the Doctor，one of his ears caught fast in a tree，and the rest of the army had to stop and help him．

By this time the Doctor had picked himself up，and on they went again，running and running．And Chee-Chee shouted，“It's all right！We haven't far to go now！”

But before they could get into the Land of the Monkeys，they came to a steep cliff with a river flowing below．This was the end of the Kingdom of Jolliginki，and the Land of the Monkeys was on the other side，across the river．

And Jip，the dog，looked down over the edge of the steep，steep cliff and said，“Golly！How are we ever going to get across？”

“Oh，dear！”said Gub-Gub．“The King's men are quite close now．Look at them！I am afraid we are going to be taken back to prison again．”And he began to weep．

But the big monkey who was carrying the pig dropped him on the ground and cried out to the other monkeys，“Boys—a bridge！Quick！—Make a bridge！We've only a minute to do it．They've got the Captain loose，and he's coming on like a deer．Get lively！A bridge！A bridge！”

The Doctor began to wonder what they were going to make a bridge out of，and he gazed around to see if they had any boards hidden any-place．

But when he looked back at the cliff，there，hanging across the river，was a bridge all ready for him—made of living monkeys！For while his back was turned，the monkeys—quick as a flash—had made themselves into a bridge，just by holding hands and feet．

And the big one shouted to the Doctor，“Walk over！Walk over—all of you—hurry！”

Gub-Gub was a bit scared，walking on such a narrow bridge at that dizzy height above the river．But he got over all right，and so did all of them．

John Dolittle was the last to cross．And just as he was getting to the other side，the King's men came rushing up to the edge of the cliff．

Then they shook their fists and yelled with rage．For they saw they were too late．The Doctor and all his animals were safe in the Land of the Monkeys and the bridge was pulled across to the other side．

Then Chee-Chee turned to the Doctor and said，“Many great explorers and gray-bearded naturalists have lain long weeks hidden in the jungle waiting to see the monkeys do that trick．But we never let a white man get a glimpse of it before．You are the first to see the famous‘Bridge of Apes．’”

And the Doctor felt very pleased．





CHAPTER VIII　THE LEADER OF THE LIONS


JOHN DOLITTLE now became dreadfully，awfully busy．He found hundreds and thousands of monkeys sick—gorillas，orangoutangs，chimpanzees，dog-faced baboons，marmosets，gray monkeys，red ones—all kinds．And many had died．

The first thing he did was to separate the sick ones from the well ones．Then he got Chee-Chee and his cousin to build him a little house of grass．The next thing：he made all the monkeys who were still well come and be vaccinated．

And for three days and three nights the monkeys kept coming from the jungles and the valleys and the hills to the little house of grass，where the Doctor sat all day and all night，vaccinating and vaccinating．

Then he had another house made—a big one，with a lot of beds in it；and he put all the sick ones in this house．

But so many were sick，there were not enough well ones to do the nursing．So he sent messages to the other animals，like the lions and the leopards and the antelopes，to come and help with the nursing．

But the Leader of the Lions was a very proud creature．And when he came to the Doctor's big house full of beds he seemed angry and scornful．

“Do you dare to ask me，sir？”he said，glaring at the Doctor．“Do you dare to ask me—ME，THE KING OF BEASTS，to wait on a lot of dirty monkeys？Why，I wouldn't even eat them between meals！”

Although the lion looked very terrible，the Doctor tried hard not to seem afraid of him．

“I didn't ask you to eat them，”he said quietly．“And besides，they're not dirty．They've all had a bath this morning．YOUR coat looks as though it needed brushing—badly．Now listen，and I'll tell you something：the day may come when the lions get sick．And if you don't help the other animals now，the lions may find themselves left all alone when THEY are in trouble．That often happens to proud people．”

“The lions are never IN trouble—they only MAKE trouble，”said the Leader，turning up his nose．And he stalked away into the jungle，feeling he had been rather smart and clever．

Then the leopards got proud too and said they wouldn't help．And then of course the antelopes—although they were too shy and timid to be rude to the Doctor like the lion—THEY pawed the ground，and smiled foolishly，and said they had never been nurses before．

And now the poor Doctor was worried frantic，wondering where he could get help enough to take care of all these thousands of monkeys in bed．

But the Leader of the Lions，when he got back to his den，saw his wife，the Queen Lioness，come running out to meet him with her hair untidy．

“One of the cubs won't eat，”she said．“I don't know WHAT to do with him．He hasn't taken a thing since last night．”

And she began to cry and shake with nervousness—for she was a good mother，even though she was a lioness．

So the Leader went into his den and looked at his children—two very cunning little cubs，lying on the floor．And one of them seemed quite poorly．

Then the lion told his wife，quite proudly，just what he had said to the Doctor．And she got so angry she nearly drove him out of the den．“You never DID have a grain of sense！”she screamed．“All the animals from here to the Indian Ocean are talking about this wonderful man，and how he can cure any kind of sickness，and how kind he is—the only man in the whole world who can talk the language of the animals！And now，NOW—when we have a sick baby on our hands，you must go and offend him！You great booby！Nobody but a fool is ever rude to a GOOD doctor．You—”and she started pulling her husband's hair．

“Go back to that white man at once，”she yelled，“and tell him you're sorry．And take all the other empty-headed lions with you—and those stupid leopards and antelopes．Then do everything the Doctor tells you．Work hard！And perhaps he will be kind enough to come and see the cub later．Now be off！HURRY，I tell you！You're not fit to be a father！”

And she went into the den next door，where another mother lion lived，and told her all about it．

So the Leader of the Lions went back to the Doctor and said，“I happened to be passing this way and thought I'd look in．Got any help yet？”

“No，”said the Doctor．“I haven't．And I'm dreadfully worried．”

“Help's pretty hard to get these days，”said the lion．“Animals don't seem to want to work anymore．You can't blame them—in a way…．Well，seeing you're in difficulties，I don't mind doing what I can—just to oblige you—so long as I don't have to wash the creatures．And I have told all the other hunting animals to come and do their share．The leopards should be here any minute now…．Oh，and by the way，we've got a sick cub at home．I don't think there's much the matter with him myself．But the wife is anxious．If you are around that way this evening，you might take a look at him，will you？”

Then the Doctor was very happy，for all the lions and the leopards and the antelopes and the giraffes and the zebras—all the animals of the forests and the mountains and the plains—came to help him in his work．There were so many of them that he had to send some away，and only kept the cleverest．

And now very soon，the monkeys began to get better．At the end of a week the big house full of beds was half empty．And at the end of the second week the last monkey had got well．

Then the Doctor's work was done，and he was so tired he went to bed and slept for three days without even turning over．





CHAPTER IX　THE MONKEYS' COUNCIL


CHEE-CHEE stood outside the Doctor's door，keeping everybody away till he woke up．Then John Dolittle told the monkeys that he must now go back to Puddleby．

They were very surprised at this，for they had thought that he was going to stay with them forever．And that night all the monkeys got together in the jungle to talk it over．

And the Chief Chimpanzee rose up and said，“Why is it the good man is going away？Is he not happy here with us？”

But none of them could answer him．

Then the Grand Gorilla got up and said，“I think we all should go to him and ask him to stay．Perhaps if we make him a new house and a bigger bed，and promise him plenty of monkey servants to work for him and to make life pleasant for him—perhaps then he will not wish to go．”

Then Chee-Chee got up，and all the others whispered，“Sh！Look！Chee-Chee，the great Traveler，is about to speak！”

And Chee-Chee said to the other monkeys，“My friends，I am afraid it is useless to ask the Doctor to stay．He owes money in Puddleby，and he says he must go back and pay it．”

And the monkeys asked him，“What is MONEY？”

Then Chee-Chee told them that in the Land of the White Men you could get nothing without money；you could DO nothing without money—that it was almost impossible to LIVE without money．

And some of them asked，“But can you not even eat and drink without paying？”

But Chee-Chee shook his head．And then he told them that even he，when he was with the organ-grinder，had been made to ask the children for money．

And the Chief Chimpanzee turned to the Oldest Orangoutang and said，“Cousin，surely these men be strange creatures！Who would wish to live in such a land？My gracious，how paltry！”

Then Chee-Chee said，“When we were coming to you we had no boat to cross the sea in and no money to buy food to eat on our journey．So a man lent us some biscuits；and we said we would pay him when we came back．And we borrowed a boat from a sailor，but it was broken on the rocks when we reached the shores of Africa．Now the Doctor says he must go back and get the sailor another boat—because the man was poor and his ship was all he had．”

And the monkeys were all silent for a while，sitting quite still upon the ground and thinking hard．

At last the Biggest Baboon got up and said，“I do not think we ought to let this good man leave our land till we have given him a fine present to take with him，so that he may know we are grateful for all that he has done for us．”

And a little tiny red monkey who was sitting up in a tree shouted down，“I think that too！”

And then they all cried out，making a great noise，“Yes，yes．Let us give him the finest present a White Man ever had！”

Now they began to wonder and ask one another what would be the best thing to give him．And one said，“Fifty bags of cocoanuts！”And another，“A hundred bunches of bananas！At least he shall not have to buy his fruit in the Land Where You Pay to Eat！”

But Chee-Chee told them that all these things would be too heavy to carry so far and would go bad before half was eaten．

“If you want to please him，”he said，“give him an animal．You may be sure he will be kind to it．Give him some rare animal they have not got in the menageries．”

And the monkeys asked him，“What are MENAGERIES？”

Then Chee-Chee explained to them that menageries were places in the Land of the White Men，where animals were put in cages for people to come and look at．

And the monkeys were very shocked and said to one another，“These Men are like thoughtless young ones—stupid and easily amused．Sh！It is a prison he means．”

So then they asked Chee-Chee what rare animal it could be that they should give the Doctor—one the White Men had not seen before．

And the Major of the Marmosets asked，“Have they an iguana over there？”

But Chee-Chee said，“Yes，there is one in the London Zoo．”

And another asked，“Have they an okapi？”

But Chee-Chee said，“Yes．In Belgium，where my organ-grinder took me five years ago，they had an okapi in a big city they call Antwerp．”

And another asked，“Have they a pushmi-pullyu？”

Then Chee-Chee said，“No．No White Man has ever seen a pushmi-pullyu．Let us give him that．”





CHAPTER X　THE RAREST ANIMAL OF ALL


PUSHMI-PULLYUS are now extinct．That means，there aren't any more．But long ago，when Doctor Dolittle was alive，there were some of them still left in the deepest jungles of Africa；and even then they were very，very scarce．They had no tail，but a head at each end，and sharp horns on each head．They were very shy and terribly hard to catch．The black men get most of their animals by sneaking up behind them while they are not looking．But you could not do this with the pushmi-pullyu—because，no matter which way you came towards him，he was always facing you．And besides，only one half of him slept at a time．The other head was always awake—and watching．This was why they were never caught and never seen in zoos．Though many of the greatest huntsmen and the cleverest menagerie-keepers spent years of their lives searching through the jungles in all weathers for pushmi-pullyus，not a single one had ever been caught．Even then，years ago，he was the only animal in the world with two heads．

Well，the monkeys set out hunting for this animal through the forest．And after they had gone a good many miles，one of them found peculiar footprints near the edge of a river，and they knew that a pushmi-pullyu must be very near that spot．

Then they went along the bank of the river a little way and they saw a place where the grass was high and thick，and they guessed that he was in there．

So they all joined hands and made a great circle around the high grass．The pushmi-pullyu heard them coming，and he tried hard to break through the ring of monkeys．But he couldn't do it．When he saw that it was no use trying to escape，he sat down and waited to see what they wanted．

They asked him if he would go with Doctor Dolittle and be put on show in the Land of the White Men．

But he shook both his heads hard and said，“Certainly not！”

They explained to him that he would not be shut up in a menagerie but would just be looked at．They told him that the Doctor was a very kind man but hadn't any money，and people would pay to see a two-headed animal，and the Doctor would get rich and could pay for the boat he had borrowed to come to Africa in．

But he answered，“No．You know how shy I am—I hate being stared at．”And he almost began to cry．

Then for three days they tried to persuade him．

And at the end of the third day he said he would come with them and see what kind of a man the Doctor was，first．

So the monkeys traveled back with the pushmi-pullyu．And when they came to where the Doctor's little house of grass was，they knocked on the door．

The duck，who was packing the trunk，said，“Come in！”

And Chee-Chee very proudly took the animal inside and showed him to the Doctor．

“What in the world is it？”asked John Dolittle，gazing at the strange creature．

“Lord save us！”cried the duck．“How does it make up its mind？”

“It doesn't look to me as though it had any，”said Jip，the dog．

“This，Doctor，”said Chee-Chee，“is the pushmi-pullyu—the rarest animal of the African jungles，the only two-headed beast in the world！Take him home with you and your fortune's made．People will pay any money to see him．”

“But I don't want any money，”said the Doctor．

“Yes，you do，”said Dab-Dab，the duck．“Don't you remember how we had to pinch and scrape to pay the butcher's bill in Puddleby？And how are you going to get the sailor the new boat you spoke of，unless we have the money to buy it？”

“I was going to make him one，”said the Doctor．

“Oh，do be sensible！”cried Dab-Dab．“Where would you get all the wood and the nails to make one with？And besides，what are we going to live on？We shall be poorer than ever when we get back．Chee-Chee's perfectly right：take the funny-looking thing along，do！”

“Well，perhaps there is something in what you say，”murmured the Doctor．“It certainly would make a nice new kind of pet．But does the er—what-do-you-call-it really want to go abroad？”

“Yes，I'll go，”said the pushmi-pullyu，who saw at once from the Doctor's face that he was a man to be trusted．“You have been so kind to the animals here—and the monkeys tell me that I am the only one who will do．But you must promise me that if I do not like it in the Land of the White Men you will send me back．”

“Why，certainly—of course，of course，”said the Doctor．“Excuse me，surely you are related to the Deer Family，are you not？”

“Yes，”said the pushmi-pullyu，“to the Abyssinian Gazelles and the Asiatic Chamois，on my mother's side．My father's great-grandfather was the last of the Unicorns．”

“Most interesting！”murmured the Doctor，and he took a book out of the trunk，which Dab-Dab was packing and began turning the pages．“Let us see if Buffon says anything—”

“I notice，”said the duck，“that you only talk with one of your mouths．Can't the other head talk as well？”

“Oh，yes，”said the pushmi-pullyu．“But I keep the other mouth for eating—mostly．In that way I can talk while I am eating without being rude．Our people have always been very polite．”

When the packing was finished and everything was ready to start，the monkeys gave a grand party for the Doctor，and all the animals of the jungle came．And they had pineapples and mangoes and honey and all sorts of good things to eat and drink．

After they had all finished eating，the Doctor got up and said，“My friends：I am not clever at speaking long words after dinner，like some men；and I have just eaten many fruits and much honey．But I wish to tell you that I am very sad at leaving your beautiful country．Because I have things to do in the Land of the White Men，I must go．After I have gone，remember never to let the flies settle on your food before you eat it；and do not sleep on the ground when the rains are coming．I—er—er—I hope you will all live happily ever after．”

When the Doctor stopped speaking and sat down，all the monkeys clapped their hands a long time and said to one another，“Let it be remembered always among our people that he sat and ate with us，here，under the trees．For surely he is the greatest of men！”

And the Grand Gorilla，who had the strength of seven horses in his hairy arms，rolled a great rock up to the head of the table and said，“This stone for all time shall mark the spot．”

And even to this day，in the heart of the jungle，that stone still is there．And monkey mothers，passing through the forest with their families，still point down at it from the branches and whisper to their children，“Sh！There it is—look—where the Good White Man sat and ate food with us in the Year of the Great Sickness！”

Then，when the party was over，the Doctor and his pets started out to go back to the seashore．

And all the monkeys went with him as far as the edge of their country，carrying his trunk and bags，to see him off．





CHAPTER XI　THE BLACK PRINCE


BY the edge of the river they stopped and said farewell．This took a long time，because all those thousands of monkeys wanted to shake John Dolittle by the hand．

Afterwards，when the Doctor and his pets were going on alone，Polynesia said，“We must tread softly and talk low as we go through the land of the Jolliginki．If the King should hear us，he will send his soldiers to catch us again，for I am sure he is still very angry over the trick I played on him．”

“What I am wondering，”said the Doctor，“is where we are going to get another boat to go home in…．Oh well，perhaps we'll find one lying about on the beach that nobody is using．‘Never lift your foot till you come to the stile．’”

One day，while they were passing through a very thick part of the forest，Chee-Chee went ahead of them to look for cocoanuts．And while he was away，the Doctor and the rest of the animals，who did not know the jungle paths so well，got lost in the deep woods．They wandered around and around but could not find their way down to the seashore．

Chee-Chee，when he could not see them anywhere，was terribly upset．He climbed high trees and looked out from the top branches to try and see the Doctor's high hat；he waved and shouted；he called to all the animals by name．But it was no use．They seemed to have disappeared altogether．

Indeed they had lost their way very badly．They had strayed a long way off the path，and the jungle was so thick with bushes and creepers and vines that sometimes they could hardly move at all，and the Doctor had to take out his pocketknife and cut his way along．They stumbled into wet，boggy places；they got all tangled up in thick convolvulus runners；they scratched themselves on thorns，and twice they nearly lost the medicine-bag in the underbrush．There seemed no end to their troubles，and nowhere could they come upon a path．

At last，after blundering about like this for many days，getting their clothes torn and their faces covered with mud，they walked right into the King's back garden by mistake．The King's men came running up at once and caught them．

But Polynesia flew into a tree in the garden，without anybody seeing her，and hid herself．The Doctor and the rest were taken before the King．

“Ha，ha！”cried the King．“So you are caught again！This time you shall not escape．Take them all back to prison and put double locks on the door．This White Man shall scrub my kitchen floor for the rest of his life！”

So the Doctor and his pets were led back to prison and locked up．And the Doctor was told that in the morning he must begin scrubbing the kitchen floor．

They were all very unhappy．

“This is a great nuisance，”said the Doctor．“I really must get back to Puddleby．That poor sailor will think I've stolen his ship if I don't get home soon…．I wonder if those hinges are loose．”

But the door was very strong and firmly locked．There seemed no chance of getting out．Then Gub-Gub began to cry again．

All this time Polynesia was still sitting in the tree in the palace-garden．She was saying nothing and blinking her eyes．

This was always a very bad sign with Polynesia．Whenever she said nothing and blinked her eyes，it meant that somebody had been making trouble，and she was thinking out some way to put things right．People who made trouble for Polynesia or her friends were nearly always sorry for it afterwards．

Presently she spied Chee-Chee swinging through the trees still looking for the Doctor．When Chee-Chee saw her，he came into her tree and asked her what had become of him．

“The Doctor and all the animals have been caught by the King's men and locked up again，”whispered Polynesia．“We lost our way in the jungle and blundered into the palace garden by mistake．”

“But couldn't you guide them？”asked Chee-Chee，and he began to scold the parrot for letting them get lost while he was away looking for the cocoanuts．

“It was all that stupid pig's fault，”said Polynesia．“He would keep running off the path hunting for ginger root．And I was kept so busy catching him and bringing him back，that I turned to the left，instead of the right，when we reached the swamp．Sh！Look！There's Prince Bumpo coming into the garden！He must not see us．Don't move，whatever you do！”

And there，sure enough，was Prince Bumpo，the King's son，opening the garden gate．He carried a book of fairy tales under his arm．He came strolling down the gravel walk，humming a sad song，till he reached a stone seat right under the tree where the parrot and the monkey were hiding．Then he lay down on the seat and began reading the fairy stories to himself．

Chee-Chee and Polynesia watched him，keeping very quiet and still．

After a while the King's son laid the book down and sighed a weary sigh．

“If I were only a WHITE prince！”said he，with a dreamy，far-away look in his eyes．

Then the parrot，talking in a small，high voice like a little girl，said aloud，“Bumpo，some one might turn thee into a white prince perchance．”

The King's son started up off the seat and looked all around．

“What is this I hear？”he cried．“Methought the sweet music of a fairy's silver voice rang from yonder bower！Strange！”

“Worthy Prince，”said Polynesia，keeping very still so Bumpo couldn't see her，“thou sayest winged words of truth．For 'tis I，Tripsitinka，the Queen of the Fairies，that speak to thee．I am hiding in a rose-bud．”

“Oh tell me，Fairy-Queen，”cried Bumpo，clasping his hands in joy，“who is it can turn me white？”

“In thy father's prison，”said the parrot，“there lies a famous wizard，John Dolittle by name．Many things he knows of medicine and magic，and mighty deeds has he performed．Yet thy kingly father leaves him languishing long and lingering hours．Go to him，brave Bumpo，secretly，when the sun has set．And behold，thou shalt be made the whitest prince that ever won fair lady！I have said enough．I must now go back to Fairyland．Farewell！”

“Farewell！”cried the Prince．“A thousand thanks，good Tripsitinka！”

And he sat down on the seat again with a smile upon his face，waiting for the sun to set．





CHAPTER XII　MEDICINE AND MAGIC


VERY，very quietly，making sure that no one should see her，Polynesia then slipped out at the back of the tree and flew across to the prison．

She found Gub-Gub poking his nose through the bars of the window，trying to sniff the cooking smells that came from the palace kitchen．She told the pig to bring the Doctor to the window because she wanted to speak to him．So Gub-Gub went and woke the Doctor who was taking a nap．

“Listen，”whispered the parrot，when John Dolittle's face appeared：“Prince Bumpo is coming here tonight to see you．And you've got to find some way to turn him white．But be sure to make him promise you first that he will open the prison door and find a ship for you to cross the sea in．”

“This is all very well，”said the Doctor．“But it isn't so easy to turn a black man white．You speak as though he were a dress to be re-dyed．It's not so simple．‘Shall the leopard change his spots，or the Ethiopian his skin，’you know？”

“I don't know anything about that，”said Polynesia impatiently．“But you MUST turn this man white．Think of a way—think hard．You've got plenty of medicines left in the bag．He'll do anything for you if you change his color．It is your only chance to get out of prison．”

“Well，I suppose it MIGHT be possible，”said the Doctor．“Let me see—”and he went over to his medicine-bag，murmuring something about，“liberated chlorine on animal-pigment—perhaps zinc ointment，as a temporary measure，spread thick—”

Well，that night Prince Bumpo came secretly to the Doctor in prison and said to him，“White Man，I am an unhappy prince．Years ago I went in search of The Sleeping Beauty，whom I had read of in a book．And having traveled through the world many days，I at last found her and kissed the lady very gently to awaken her—as the book said I should．'Tis true indeed that she awoke．But when she saw my face she cried out，‘Oh，he's black！’And she ran away and wouldn't marry me—but went to sleep again somewhere else．So I came back，full of sadness，to my father's kingdom．Now I hear that you are a wonderful magician and have many powerful potions．So I come to you for help．If you will turn me white，so that I may go back to The Sleeping Beauty，I will give you half my kingdom and anything besides you ask．”

“Prince Bumpo，”said the Doctor，looking thoughtfully at the bottles in his medicine-bag，“supposing I made your hair a nice blonde color—would not that do instead to make you happy？”

“No，”said Bumpo．“Nothing else will satisfy me．I must be a white prince．”

“You know it is very hard to change the color of a prince，”said the Doctor，“one of the hardest things a magician can do．You only want your face white，do you not？”

“Yes，that is all，”said Bumpo．“Because I shall wear shining armor and gauntlets of steel，like the other white princes，and ride on a horse．”

“Must your face be white all over？”asked the Doctor．

“Yes，all over，”said Bumpo，“and I would like my eyes blue too，but I suppose that would be very hard to do．”

“Yes，it would，”said the Doctor quickly．“Well，I will do what I can for you．You will have to be very patient though—you know with some medicines you can never be very sure．I might have to try two or three times．You have a strong skin—yes？Well that's all right．Now come over here by the light—Oh，but before I do anything，you must first go down to the beach and get a ship ready，with food in it，to take me across the sea．Do not speak a word of this to anyone．And when I have done as you ask，you must let me and all my animals out of prison．Promise—by the crown of Jolliginki！”

So the Prince promised and went away to get a ship ready at the seashore．

When he came back and said that it was done，the Doctor asked Dab-Dab to bring a basin．Then he mixed a lot of medicines in the basin and told Bumpo to dip his face in it．

The Prince leaned down and put his face in—right up to the ears．

He held it there a long time—so long that the Doctor seemed to get dreadfully anxious and fidgety，standing first on one leg and then on the other，looking at all the bottles he had used for the mixture，and reading the labels on them again and again．A strong smell filled the prison，like the smell of brown paper burning．

At last the Prince lifted his face up out of the basin，breathing very hard．And all the animals cried out in surprise．

For the Prince's face had turned as white as snow，and his eyes，which had been mud-colored，were a manly gray！

When John Dolittle lent him a little looking-glass to see himself in，he sang for joy and began dancing around the prison．But the Doctor asked him not to make so much noise about it；and when he had closed his medicine-bag in a hurry he told him to open the prison door．

Bumpo begged that he might keep the looking-glass，as it was the only one in the Kingdom of Jolliginki，and he wanted to look at himself all day long．But the Doctor said he needed it to shave with．

Then the Prince，taking a bunch of copper keys from his pocket，undid the great double locks．And the Doctor with all his animals ran as fast as they could down to the seashore while Bumpo leaned against the wall of the empty dungeon，smiling after them happily，his big face shining like polished ivory in the light of the moon．

When they came to the beach they saw Polynesia and Chee-Chee waiting for them on the rocks near the ship．

“I feel sorry about Bumpo，”said the Doctor．

“I am afraid that medicine I used will never last．Most likely he will be as black as ever when he wakes up in the morning—that's one reason why I didn't like to leave the mirror with him．But then again，he MIGHT stay white—I had never used that mixture before．To tell the truth，I was surprised，myself，that it worked so well．But I had to do something，didn't I？I couldn't possibly scrub the King's kitchen for the rest of my life．It was such a dirty kitchen！I could see it from the prison window．Well，well！Poor Bumpo！”

“Oh，of course he will know we were just joking with him，”said the parrot．

“They had no business to lock us up，”said Dab-Dab，waggling her tail angrily．“We never did them any harm．Serve him right，if he does turn black again！I hope it's a dark black．”

“But HE didn't have anything to do with it，”said the Doctor．“It was the King，his father，who had us locked up—it wasn't Bumpo's fault…．I wonder if I ought to go back and apologize—Oh，well—I'll send him some candy when I get to Puddleby．And who knows？he may stay white after all．”

“The Sleeping Beauty would never have him，even if he did，”said Dab-Dab．“He looked better the way he was，I thought．But he'd never be anything but ugly，no matter what color he was made．”

“Still，he had a good heart，”said the Doctor，“romantic，of course—but a good heart．After all，‘handsome is as handsome does．’”

“I don't believe the poor booby found The Sleeping Beauty at all，”said Jip，the dog．“Most likely he kissed some farmer's fat wife who was taking a snooze under an apple tree．Can't blame her for getting scared！I wonder who he'll go and kiss this time．Silly business！”

Then the pushmi-pullyu，the white mouse，Gub-Gub，Dab-Dab，Jip and the owl，Too-Too，went on to the ship with the Doctor．But Chee-Chee，Polynesia and the crocodile stayed behind，because Africa was their proper home，the land where they were born．

And when the Doctor stood upon the boat，he looked over the side across the water．And then he remembered that they had no one with them to guide them back to Puddleby．

The wide，wide sea looked terribly big and lonesome in the moonlight，and he began to wonder if they would lose their way when they passed out of sight of land．

But even while he was wondering，they heard a strange whispering noise high in the air，coming through the night．And the animals all stopped saying good-bye and listened．

The noise grew louder and bigger．It seemed to be coming nearer to them—a sound like the autumn wind blowing through the leaves of a poplar tree，or a great，great rain beating down upon a roof．

And Jip，with his nose pointing and his tail quite straight，said，“Birds！—millions of them—flying fast—that's it！”

And then they all looked up．And there，streaming across the face of the moon，like a huge swarm of tiny ants，they could see thousands and thousands of little birds．Soon the whole sky seemed full of them，and still more kept coming—more and more．There were so many that for a little while they covered the whole moon so it could not shine，and the sea grew dark and black—like when a storm cloud passes over the sun．

And presently all these birds came down close，skimming over the water and the land；and the night sky was left clear above，and the moon shone as before．Still never a call nor a cry nor a song they made—no sound but this great rustling of feathers which grew greater now than ever．When they began to settle on the sands，along the ropes of the ship—anywhere and everywhere except the trees—the Doctor could see that they had blue wings and white breasts and very short，feathered legs．As soon as they had all found a place to sit，suddenly，there was no noise left anywhere．All was quiet．All was still．

And in the silent moonlight John Dolittle spoke：“I had no idea that we had been in Africa so long．It will be nearly summer when we get home．For these are the swallows going back．Swallows，I thank you for waiting for us．It is very thoughtful of you．Now we need not be afraid that we will lose our way upon the sea…．Pull up the anchor and set the sail！”

When the ship moved out upon the water，those who stayed behind，Chee-Chee，Polynesia and the crocodile，grew terribly sad．For never in their lives had they known anyone they liked so well as Doctor John Dolittle of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh．And after they had called good-bye to him again and again and again，they still stood there upon the rocks，crying bitterly and waving till the ship was out of sight．





CHAPTER XIII　RED SAILS AND BLUE WINGS


SAILING homeward，the Doctor's ship had to pass the coast of Barbary．This coast is the seashore of the Great Desert．It is a wild，lonely place—all sand and stones．And it was here that the Barbary pirates lived．

These pirates，a bad lot of men，used to wait for sailors to be shipwrecked on their shores．And often，if they saw a boat passing，they would come out in their fast sailing ships and chase it．When they caught a boat like this at sea，they would steal everything on it；and after they had taken the people off，they would sink the ship and sail back to Barbary singing songs and feeling proud of the mischief they had done．Then they used to make the people they had caught write home to their friends for money．And if the friends sent no money，the pirates often threw the people into the sea．

Now one sunshiny day the Doctor and Dab-Dab were walking up and down on the ship for exercise．A nice fresh wind was blowing the boat along，and everybody was happy．Presently Dab-Dab saw the sail of another ship a long way behind them on the edge of the sea．It was a red sail．

“I don't like the look of that sail，”said Dab-Dab．“I have a feeling it isn't a friendly ship．I am afraid there is more trouble coming to us．”

Jip，who was lying near taking a nap in the sun，began to growl and talk in his sleep．

“I smell roast beef cooking，”he mumbled，“underdone roast beef，with brown gravy over it．”

“Good gracious！”cried the Doctor．“What's the matter with the dog？Is he SMELLING in his sleep—as well as talking？”

“I suppose he is，”said Dab-Dab．“All dogs can smell in their sleep．”

“But what is he smelling？”asked the Doctor．“There is no roast beef cooking on our ship．”

“No，”said Dab-Dab．“The roast beef must be on that other ship over there．”

“But that's ten miles away，”said the Doctor．“He couldn't smell that far，surely！”

“Oh，yes，he could，”said Dab-Dab．“You ask him．”

Then Jip，still fast asleep，began to growl again and his lip curled up angrily，showing his clean，white teeth．

“I smell bad men，”he growled，“the worst men I ever smelt．I smell trouble．I smell a fight—six bad scoundrels fighting against one brave man．I want to help him．Woof—oo—WOOF！”Then he barked loudly，and woke himself up with a surprised look on his face．

“See！”cried Dab-Dab．“That boat is nearer now．You can count its three big sails—all red．Whoever it is，they are coming after us…．I wonder who they are．”

“They are bad sailors，”said Jip；“and their ship is very swift．They are surely the pirates of Barbary．”

“Well，we must put up more sails on our boat，”said the Doctor，“so we can go faster and get away from them．Run downstairs，Jip，and fetch me all the sails you see．”

The dog hurried downstairs and dragged up every sail he could find．

But even when all these were put up on the masts to catch the wind，the boat did not go nearly as fast as the pirates'—which kept coming on behind，closer and closer．

“This is a poor ship the Prince gave us，”said Gub-Gub，the pig．“the slowest he could find，I should think．Might as well try to win a race in a soup tureen as hope to get away from them in this old barge．Look how near they are now！— You can see the mustaches on the faces of the men—six of them．What are we going to do？”

Then the Doctor asked Dab-Dab to fly up and tell the swallows that pirates were coming after them in a swift ship，and what should he do about it．

When the swallows heard this，they all came down onto the Doctor's ship，and they told him to unravel some pieces of long rope and make them into a lot of thin strings as quickly as he could．Then the ends of these strings were tied onto the front of the ship，and the swallows took hold of the strings with their feet and flew off，pulling the boat along．

And although swallows are not very strong when only one or two are by themselves，it is different when there are a great lot of them together．And there，tied to the Doctor's ship，were a thousand strings，and two thousand swallows were pulling on each string—all terribly swift fliers．

And in a moment the Doctor found himself traveling so fast he had to hold his hat on with both hands，for he felt as though the ship itself were flying through waves that frothed and boiled with speed．

And all the animals on the ship began to laugh and dance about in the rushing air，for when they looked back at the pirates' ship，they could see that it was growing smaller now，instead of bigger．The red sails were being left far，far behind．





CHAPTER XIV　THE RATS' WARNING


DRAGGING a ship through the sea is hard work．And after two or three hours the swallows began to get tired in the wings and short of breath．Then they sent a message down to the Doctor to say that they would have to take a rest soon，and that they would pull the boat over to an island not far off，and hide it in a deep bay till they had got breath enough to go on．

And presently the Doctor saw the island they had spoken of．It had a very beautiful high green mountain in the middle of it．

When the ship had sailed safely into the bay where it could not be seen from the open sea，the Doctor said he would get off onto the island to look for water because there was none left to drink on his ship．And he told all the animals to get out too and romp on the grass to stretch their legs．

Now as they were getting off，the Doctor noticed that a whole lot of rats were coming up from downstairs and leaving the ship as well．Jip started to run after them，because chasing rats had always been his favorite game．But the Doctor told him to stop．

And one big black rat，who seemed to want to say something to the Doctor，now crept forward timidly along the rail，watching the dog out of the corner of his eye．And after he had coughed nervously two or three times，and cleaned his whiskers and wiped his mouth，he said，“Ahem—er—you know of course that all ships have rats in them，Doctor，do you not？”

And the Doctor said，“Yes．”

“And you have heard that rats always leave a sinking ship？”

“Yes，”said the Doctor．“So I've been told．”

“People，”said the rat，“always speak of it with a sneer—as though it were something disgraceful．But you can't blame us，can you？After all，who WOULD stay on a sinking ship，if he could get off it？”

“It's very natural，”said the Doctor，“very natural．I quite under-stand…．Was there— Was there anything else you wished to say？”

“Yes，”said the rat．“I've come to tell you that we are leaving this one．But we wanted to warn you before we go．This is a bad ship you have here．It isn't safe．The sides aren't strong enough．Its boards are rotten．Before tomorrow night it will sink to the bottom of the sea．”

“But how do you know？”asked the Doctor．

“We always know，”answered the rat．“The tips of our tails get that tingly feeling—like when your foot's asleep．This morning，at six o'clock，while I was getting breakfast，my tail suddenly began to tingle．At first I thought it was my rheumatism coming back．So I went and asked my aunt how she felt—you remember her？—the long，piebald rat，rather skinny，who came to see you in Puddleby last spring with jaundice？Well—and she said HER tail was tingling like everything！Then we knew，for sure，that this boat was going to sink in less than two days，and we all made up our minds to leave it as soon as we got near enough to any land．It's a bad ship，Doctor．Don't sail in it anymore，or you'll be surely drowned…．Good-bye！We are now going to look for a good place to live on this island．”

“Good-bye！”said the Doctor．“And thank you very much for coming to tell me．Very considerate of you—very！Give my regards to your aunt．I remember her perfectly…．Leave that rat alone，Jip！Come here！Lie down！”

So then the Doctor and all his animals went off，carrying pails and saucepans，to look for water on the island，while the swallows took their rest．

“I wonder what is the name of this island，”said the Doctor，as he was climbing up the mountainside．“It seems a pleasant place．What a lot of birds there are！”

“Why，these are the Canary Islands，”said Dab-Dab．“Don't you hear the canaries singing？”

The Doctor stopped and listened．

“Why，to be sure—of course！”he said．“How stupid of me！I wonder if they can tell us where to find water．”

And presently the canaries，who had heard all about Doctor Dolittle from birds of passage，came and led him to a beautiful spring of cool，clear water where the canaries used to take their bath；and they showed him lovely meadows where the birdseed grew and all the other sights of their island．

And the pushmi-pullyu was glad they had come because he liked the green grass so much better than the dried apples he had been eating on the ship．And Gub-Gub squeaked for joy when he found a whole valley full of wild sugarcane．

A little later，when they had all had plenty to eat and drink，and were lying on their backs while the canaries sang for them，two of the swallows came hurrying up，very flustered and excited．

“Doctor！”they cried，“the pirates have come into the bay，and they've all got onto your ship．They are downstairs looking for things to steal．They have left their own ship with nobody on it．If you hurry and come down to the shore，you can get onto their ship—which is very fast—and escape．But you'll have to hurry．”

“That's a good idea，”said the Doctor，“splendid！”

And he called his animals together at once，said good-bye to the canaries and ran down to the beach．

When they reached the shore they saw the pirate ship，with the three red sails，standing in the water，and—just as the swallows had said—there was nobody on it；all the pirates were downstairs in the Doctor's ship，looking for things to steal．

So John Dolittle told his animals to walk very softly and they all crept onto the pirate ship．





CHAPTER XV　THE BARBARY DRAGON


EVERYTHING would have gone all right if the pig had not caught a cold in his head while eating the damp sugarcane on the island．This is what happened：

After they had pulled up the anchor without a sound，and were moving the ship very，very carefully out of the bay，Gub-Gub suddenly sneezed so loudly that the pirates on the other ship came rushing upstairs to see what the noise was．

As soon as they saw that the Doctor was escaping，they sailed the other boat right across the entrance to the bay so that the Doctor could not get out into the open sea．

Then the leader of these bad men （who called himself Ben Ali，The Dragon） shook his fist at the Doctor and shouted across the water，“Ha！Ha！You are caught，my fine friend！You were going to run off in my ship，eh？But you are not a good enough sailor to beat Ben Ali，the Barbary Dragon．I want that duck you've got—and the pig too．We'll have pork chops and roast duck for supper tonight．And before I let you go home，you must make your friends send me a trunkfull of gold．”

Poor Gub-Gub began to weep，and Dab-Dab made ready to fly to save her life．But the owl，Too-Too，whispered to the Doctor，“Keep him talking，Doctor．Be pleasant to him．Our old ship is bound to sink soon—the rats said it would be at the bottom of the sea before to-morrow night—and the rats are never wrong．Be pleasant，till the ship sinks under him．Keep him talking．”

“What，until tomorrow night！”said the Doctor．“Well，I'll do my best…．Let me see— What shall I talk about？”

“Oh，let them come on，”said Jip．“We can fight the dirty rascals．There are only six of them．Let them come on．I'd love to tell that collie next door，when we get home，that I had bitten a real pirate．Let 'em come．We can fight them．”

“But they have pistols and swords，”said the Doctor．“No，that would never do．I must talk to him…．Look here，Ben Ali—”

But before the Doctor could say any more，the pirates began to sail the ship nearer，laughing with glee，and saying one to another，“Who shall be the first to catch the pig？”

Poor Gub-Gub was dreadfully frightened；and the pushmi-pullyu began to sharpen his horns for a fight by rubbing them on the mast of the ship，while Jip kept springing into the air and barking and calling Ben Ali bad names in dog language．

But presently something seemed to go wrong with the pirates；they stopped laughing and cracking jokes；they looked puzzled；something was making them uneasy．

Then Ben Ali，staring down at his feet，suddenly bellowed out，“Thunder and Lightning！Men，THE BOAT'S LEAKING！”

And then the other pirates peered over the side and they saw that the boat was indeed getting lower and lower in the water．And one of them said to Ben Ali，“But surely if this old boat were sinking we should see the rats leaving it．”

And Jip shouted across from the other ship，“You great duffers，there are no rats there to leave！They left two hours ago！‘Ha，ha，’to you，‘my fine friends！’”

But of course the men did not understand him．Soon the front end of the ship began to go down and down，faster and faster—till the boat looked almost as though it were standing on its head；and the pirates had to cling to the rails and the masts and the ropes and anything to keep from sliding off．Then the sea rushed roaring in and through all the windows and the doors．And at last the ship plunged right down to the bottom of the sea，making a dreadful gurgling sound；and the six bad men were left bobbing about in the deep water of the bay．

Some of them started to swim for the shores of the island，while others came and tried to get on to the boat where the Doctor was．But Jip kept snapping at their noses，so they were afraid to climb up the side of the ship．

Then suddenly they all cried out in great fear，“THE SHARKS！The sharks are coming！Let us get onto the ship before they eat us！Help，help！The sharks！The sharks！”

And now the Doctor could see，all over the bay，the backs of big fishes swimming swiftly through the water．

And one great shark came near to the ship，and poking his nose out of the water he said to the Doctor，“Are you John Dolittle，the famous animal doctor？”

“Yes，”said Doctor Dolittle．“That is my name．”

“Well，”said the shark，“we know these pirates to be a bad lot—especially Ben Ali．If they are annoying you，we will gladly eat them up for you，and then you won't be troubled anymore．”

“Thank you，”said the Doctor．“This is really most attentive．But I don't think it will be necessary to eat them．Don't let any of them reach the shore until I tell you—just keep them swimming about，will you？And please make Ben Ali swim over here so that I may talk to him．”

So the shark went off and chased Ben Ali over to the Doctor．

“Listen，Ben Ali，”said John Dolittle，leaning over the side．“You have been a very bad man，and I understand that you have killed many people．These good sharks here have just offered to eat you up for me—and 'twould indeed be a good thing if the seas were rid of you．But if you will promise to do as I tell you，I well let you go in safety．”

“What must I do？”asked the pirate，looking down sideways at the big shark who was smelling his leg under the water．

“You must kill no more people；”said the Doctor，“you must stop stealing；you must never sink another ship；you must give up being a pirate altogether．”

“But what shall I do then？”asked Ben Ali．“How shall I live？”

“You and all your men must go onto this island and be birdseed farmers，”the Doctor answered．“You must grow birdseed for the canaries．”

The Barbary Dragon turned pale with anger．“GROW BIRDSEED！”he groaned in disgust．“Can't I be a sailor？”

“No，”said the Doctor，“you cannot．You have been a sailor long enough—and sent many stout ships and good men to the bottom of the sea．For the rest of your life you must be a peaceful farmer．The shark is waiting．Do not waste any more of his time．Make up your mind．”

“Thunder and Lightning！”Ben Ali muttered，“BIRDSEED！”Then he looked down into the water again and saw the great fish smelling his other leg．

“Very well，”he said sadly．“We'll be farmers．”

“And remember，”said the Doctor，“that if you do not keep your promise，if you start killing and stealing again，I shall hear of it，because the canaries will come and tell me．And be very sure that I will find a way to punish you．For though I may not be able to sail a ship as well as you，so long as the birds and the beasts and the fishes are my friends，I do not have to be afraid of a pirate chief—even though he call himself The Dragon of Barbary．Now go and be a good farmer and live in peace．”

Then the Doctor turned to the big shark，and waving his hand he said，“All right．Let them swim safely to the land．”





CHAPTER XVI　TOO-TOO，THE LISTENER


HAVING thanked the sharks again for their kindness，the Doctor and his pets set off once more on their journey home in the swift ship with the three red sails．

As they moved out into the open sea，the animals all went downstairs to see what their new boat was like inside，while the Doctor leant on the rail at the back of the ship with a pipe in his mouth，watching the Canary Islands fade away in the blue dusk of the evening．

While he was standing there，wondering how the monkeys were getting on and what his garden would look like when he got back to Puddleby，Dab-Dab came tumbling up the stairs，all smiles and full of news．

“Doctor！”she cried．“This ship of the pirates is simply beautiful—absolutely．The beds downstairs are made of primrose silk，with hundreds of big pillows and cushions；there are thick，soft carpets on the floors；the dishes are made of silver．And there are all sorts of good things to eat and drink—special things；the larder—well，it's just like a shop，that's all．You never saw anything like it in your life．Just think—they kept five different kinds of sardines，those men！Come and look…．Oh，and we found a little room down there with the door locked，and we are all crazy to get in and see what's inside．Jip says it must be where the pirates kept their treasure．But we can't open the door．Come down and see if you can let us in．”

So the Doctor went downstairs and he saw that it was indeed a beautiful ship．He found the animals gathered around a little door，all talking at once，trying to guess what was inside．The Doctor turned the handle，but it wouldn't open．Then they all started to hunt for the key．They looked under the mat；they looked under all the carpets；they looked in all the cupboards and drawers and lockers，in the big chests in the ship's dining room．They looked everywhere．

While they were doing this they discovered a lot of new and wonderful things that the pirates must have stolen from other ships：kashmir shawls as thin as a cobweb，embroidered with flowers of gold；jars of fine tobacco from Jamaica；carved ivory boxes full of Russian tea；an old violin with a string broken and a picture on the back；a set of big chessmen，carved out of coral and amber；a walking stick which had a sword inside it when you pulled the handle；six wineglasses with turquoise and silver around the rims；and a lovely great sugar bowl，made of mother o'pearl．But nowhere in the whole boat could they find a key to fit that lock．

So they all came back to the door，and Jip peered through the key-hole．But something had been stood against the wall on the inside and he could see nothing．

While they were standing around，wondering what they should do，the owl，Too-Too，suddenly said，“Sh！Listen！I do believe there's some-one in there！”

They all kept still a moment．Then the Doctor said，“You must be mistaken，Too-Too．I don't hear anything．”

“I'm sure of it，”said the owl．“Sh！There it is again．Don't you hear that？”

“No，I do not，”said the Doctor．“What kind of a sound is it？”

“I hear the noise of someone putting his hand in his pocket，”said the owl．

“But that makes hardly any sound at all，”said the Doctor．“You couldn't hear that out here．”

“Pardon me，but I can，”said Too-Too．“I tell you there is some one on the other side of that door putting his hand in his pocket．Almost everything makes SOME noise—if your ears are only sharp enough to catch it．Bats can hear a mole walking in his tunnel under the earth—and they think they're good hearers．But we owls can tell you，using only one ear，the color of a kitten from the way it winks in the dark．”

“Well，well！”said the Doctor．“You surprise me．That's very interesting…．Listen again and tell me what he's doing now．”

“I'm not sure yet，”said Too-Too，“if it's a man at all．Maybe it's a woman．Lift me up and let me listen at the keyhole and I'll soon tell you．”

So the Doctor lifted the owl up and held him close to the lock of the door．

After a moment Too-Too said，“Now he's rubbing his face with his left hand．It is a small hand and a small face．It MIGHT be a woman．No．Now he pushes his hair back off his forehead．It's a man all right．”

“Women sometimes do that，”said the Doctor．

“True，”said the owl．“But when they do，their long hair makes quite a different sound…．Sh！Make that fidgety pig keep still．Now all hold your breath a moment so I can listen well．This is very difficult，what I'm doing now—and the pesky door is so thick！Sh！Everybody be quite still—shut your eyes and don't breathe．”

Too-Too leaned down and listened again very hard and long．

At last he looked up into the Doctor's face and said，“The man in there is unhappy．He weeps．He has taken care not to blubber or sniffle，lest we should find out that he is crying．But I heard—quite distinctly—the sound of a tear falling on his sleeve．”

“How do you know it wasn't a drop of water falling off the ceiling on him？”asked Gub-Gub．

“Pshaw！Such ignorance！”sniffed Too-Too．“A drop of water falling off the ceiling would have made ten times as much noise！”

“Well，”said the Doctor，“if the poor fellow's unhappy，we've got to get in and see what's the matter with him．Find me an axe，and I'll chop the door down．”





CHAPTER XVII　THE OCEAN GOSSIPS


RIGHT away an axe was found．And the Doctor soon chopped a hole in the door big enough to clamber through．

At first he could see nothing at all，it was so dark inside．So he struck a match．

The room was quite small with no window，and the ceiling was low．For furniture there was only one little stool．All around the room big barrels stood against the walls，fastened at the bottom so they wouldn't tumble with the rolling of the ship．Above the barrels，pewter jugs of all sizes hung from wooden pegs．There was a strong，winey smell．And in the middle of the floor sat a little boy about eight years old，crying bitterly．

“I declare，it is the pirates'rum room！”said Jip in a whisper．

“Yes．Very rum！”said Gub-Gub．“The smell makes me giddy．”

The little boy seemed rather frightened to find a man standing there before him and all those animals staring in through the hole in the broken door．But as soon as he saw John Dolittle's face by the light of the match，he stopped crying and got up．

“You aren't one of the pirates，are you？”he asked．

And when the Doctor threw back his head and laughed long and loud，the little boy smiled too and came and took his hand．

“You laugh like a friend，”he said，“not like a pirate．Could you tell me where my uncle is？”

“I am afraid I can't，”said the Doctor．“When did you see him last？”

“It was the day before yesterday，”said the boy．“I and my uncle were out fishing in our little boat，when the pirates came and caught us．They sunk our fishing boat and brought us both onto this ship．They told my uncle that they wanted him to be a pirate like them，for he was clever at sailing a ship in all weathers．But he said he didn't want to be a pirate，because killing people and stealing was no work for a good fisherman to do．Then the leader，Ben Ali，got very angry and gnashed his teeth，and said they would throw my uncle into the sea if he didn't do as they said．They sent me downstairs，and I heard the noise of a fight going on above．And when they let me come up again next day，my uncle was nowhere to be seen．I asked the pirates where he was，but they wouldn't tell me．I am very much afraid they threw him into the sea and drowned him．”

And the little boy began to cry again．

“Well now，wait a minute，”said the Doctor．“Don't cry．Let's go and have tea in the dining room，and we'll talk it over．Maybe your uncle is quite safe all the time．You don't KNOW that he was drowned，do you？And that's something．Perhaps we can find him for you．First we'll go and have tea—with strawberry jam；and then we will see what can be done．”

All the animals had been standing around listening with great curiosity．And when they had gone into the ship's dining room and were having tea，Dab-Dab came up behind the Doctor's chair and whispered，“Ask the porpoises if the boy's uncle was drowned—they'll know．”

“All right，”said the Doctor，taking a second piece of bread and jam．

“What are those funny clicking noises you are making with your tongue？”asked the boy．

“Oh，I just said a couple of words in duck language，”the Doctor answered．“This is Dab-Dab，one of my pets．”

“I didn't even know that ducks had a language，”said the boy．“Are all these other animals your pets，too？What is that strange-looking thing with two heads？”

“Sh！”the Doctor whispered．“That is the pushmi-pullyu．Don't let him see we're talking about him—he gets so dreadfully embarrassed…．Tell me，how did you come to be locked up in that little room？”

“The pirates shut me in there when they were going off to steal things from another ship．When I heard someone chopping on the door，I didn't know who it could be．I was very glad to find it was you．Do you think you will be able to find my uncle for me？”

“Well，we are going to try very hard，”said the Doctor．“Now，what was your uncle like to look at？”

“He had red hair，”the boy answered，“very red hair，and the picture of an anchor tattooed on his arm．He was a strong man，a kind uncle and the best sailor in the South Atlantic．His fishing boat was called The Saucy Sally—a cutter-rigged sloop．”

“What's‘cutterigsloop？’”whispered Gub-Gub，turning to Jip．

“Sh！That's the kind of a ship the man had，”said Jip．“Keep still，can't you？”

“Oh，”said the pig，“is that all？I thought it was something to drink．”

So the Doctor left the boy to play with the animals in the dining room，and went upstairs to look for passing porpoises．

And soon a whole school came dancing and jumping through the water，on their way to Brazil．

When they saw the Doctor leaning on the rail of his ship，they came over to see how he was getting on．

And the Doctor asked them if they had seen anything of a man with red hair and an anchor tattooed on his arm．

“Do you mean the master of The Saucy Sally？”asked the porpoises．

“Yes，”said the Doctor．“That's the man．Has he been drowned？”

“His fishing sloop was sunk，”said the porpoises，“for we saw it lying on the bottom of the sea．But there was nobody inside it，because we went and looked．”

“His little nephew is on the ship with me here，”said the Doctor．“And he is terribly afraid that the pirates threw his uncle into the sea．Would you be so good as to find out for me，for sure，whether he has been drowned or not？”

“Oh，he isn't drowned，”said the porpoises．“If he were，we would be sure to have heard of it from the deep-sea Decapods．We hear all the salt-water news．The shellfish call us‘The Ocean Gossips．’No—tell the little boy we are sorry we do not know where his uncle is，but we are quite certain he hasn't been drowned in the sea．”

So the Doctor ran downstairs with the news and told the nephew，who clapped his hands with happiness．And the pushmi-pullyu took the little boy on his back and gave him a ride around the dining room table，while all the other animals followed behind，beating the dish covers with spoons，pretending it was a parade．





CHAPTER XVIII　SMELLS


“YOUR uncle must now be FOUND，”said the Doctor，“that is the next thing，now that we know he wasn't thrown into the sea．”

Then Dab-Dab came up to him again and whispered，“Ask the eagles to look for the man．No living creature can see better than an eagle．When they are miles high in the air they can count the ants crawling on the ground．Ask the eagles．”

So the Doctor sent one of the swallows off to get some eagles．

And in about an hour the little bird came back with six different kinds of eagles：a Black Eagle，a Bald Eagle，a Fish Eagle，a Golden Eagle，an Eagle Vulture，and a White-tailed Sea Eagle．Twice as high as the boy they were，each one of them．And they stood on the rail of the ship，like round-shouldered soldiers all in a row，stern and still and stiff，while their great gleaming black eyes shot darting glances here and there and everywhere．

Gub-Gub was scared of them and got behind a barrel．He said he felt as though those terrible eyes were looking right inside of him to see what he had stolen for lunch．

And the Doctor said to the eagles，“A man has been lost—a fisherman with red hair and an anchor marked on his arm．Would you be so kind as to see if you can find him for us？This boy is the man's nephew．”

Eagles do not talk very much．And all they answered in their husky voices was，“You may be sure that we will do our best—for John Dolittle．”

Then they flew off，and Gub-Gub came out from behind his barrel to see them go．Up and up and up they went，higher and higher and higher still．Then，when the Doctor could only just see them，they parted company and started going off all different ways—north，east，south and west，looking like tiny grains of black sand creeping across the wide blue sky．

“My gracious！”said Gub-Gub in a hushed voice．“What a height！I wonder they don't scorch their feathers—so near the sun！”

They were gone a long time．And when they came back it was almost night．

And the eagles said to the Doctor，“We have searched all the seas and all the countries and all the islands and all the cities and all the villages in this half of the world．But we have failed．In the main street of Gibraltar we saw three red hairs lying on a wheelbarrow before a baker's door．But they were not the hairs of a man—they were the hairs out of a fur coat．Nowhere，on land or water，could we see any sign of this boy's uncle．And if WE could not see him，then he is not to be seen…．For John Dolittle，we have done our best．”

Then the six great birds flapped their big wings and flew back to their homes in the mountains and the rocks．

“Well，”said Dab-Dab，after they had gone，“what are we going to do now？The boy's uncle MUST be found—there's no two ways about that．The lad isn't old enough to be knocking around the world by himself．Boys aren't like ducklings—they have to be taken care of till they're quite old…．I wish Chee-Chee were here．He would soon find the man．Good old Chee-Chee！I wonder how he's getting on！”

“If we only had Polynesia with us，”said the white mouse．“SHE would soon think of some way．Do you remember how she got us all out of prison—the second time？My，but she was a clever one！”

“I don't think so much of those eagle fellows，”said Jip．“They're just conceited．They may have very good eyesight and all that，but when you ask them to find a man for you，they can't do it—and they have the cheek to come back and say that nobody else could do it．They're just conceited—like that collie in Puddleby．And I don't think a whole lot of those gossipy old porpoises either．All they could tell us was that the man isn't in the sea．We don't want to know where he ISN'T—we want to know where he IS．”

“Oh，don't talk so much，”said Gub-Gub．“It's easy to talk，but it isn't so easy to find a man when you have got the whole world to hunt him in．Maybe the fisherman's hair has turned white，worrying about the boy，and that was why the eagles didn't find him．You don't know everything．You're just talking．You are not doing anything to help．You couldn't find the boy's uncle any more than the eagles could—you couldn't do as well．”

“Couldn't I？”said the dog．“That's all you know，you stupid piece of warm bacon！I haven't begun to try yet，have I？You wait and see！”

Then Jip went to the Doctor and said，“Ask the boy if he has anything in his pockets that belonged to his uncle，will you，please？”

So the Doctor asked him．And the boy showed them a gold ring that he wore on a piece of string around his neck because it was too big for his finger．He said his uncle gave it to him when they saw the pirates coming．

Jip smelt the ring and said，“That's no good．Ask him if he has anything else that belonged to his uncle．”

Then the boy took from his pocket a great big red handkerchief and said，“This was my uncle's too．”

As soon as the boy pulled it out，Jip shouted，“SNUFF，by Jingo！Black Rappee snuff．Don't you smell it？His uncle took snuff— ask him，Doctor．”

The Doctor questioned the boy again，and he said，“Yes．My uncle took a lot of snuff．”

“Fine！”said Jip．“The man's as good as found．'Twill be as easy as stealing milk from a kitten．Tell the boy I'll find his uncle for him in less than a week．Let us go upstairs and see which way the wind is blowing．”

“But it is dark now，”said the Doctor．“You can't find him in the dark！”

“I don't need any light to look for a man who smells of Black Rappee snuff，”said Jip as he climbed the stairs．“If the man had a hard smell，like string，now，or hot water，it would be different．But SNUFF！Tut，tut！”

“Does hot water have a smell？”asked the Doctor．

“Certainly it has，”said Jip．“Hot water smells quite different from cold water．It is warm water—or ice—that has the really difficult smell．Why，I once followed a man for ten miles on a dark night by the smell of the hot water he had used to shave with，for the poor fellow had no soap…．Now then，let us see which way the wind is blowing．Wind is very important in long-distance smelling．It mustn't be too fierce a wind，and of course it must blow the right way．A nice，steady，damp breeze is the best of all…．Ha！This wind is from the north．”

Then Jip went up to the front of the ship and smelt the wind，and he started muttering to himself，“Tar；Spanish onions；kerosene oil；wet raincoats；crushed laurel leaves；rubber burning；lace curtains being washed—No，my mistake，lace curtains hanging out to dry；and foxes—hundreds of 'em—cubs；and—”

“Can you really smell all those different things in this one wind？”asked the Doctor．

“Why，of course！”said Jip．“And those are only a few of the easy smells—the strong ones．Any mongrel could smell those with a cold in the head．Wait now，and I'll tell you some of the harder scents that are coming on this wind—a few of the dainty ones．”

Then the dog shut his eyes tight，poked his nose straight up in the air and sniffed hard with his mouth half open．

For a long time he said nothing．He kept as still as a stone．He hardly seemed to be breathing at all．When at last he began to speak，it sounded almost as though he were singing sadly in a dream．

“Bricks，”he whispered，very low，“old yellow bricks，crumbling with age in a garden wall；the sweet breath of young cows standing in a mountain stream；the lead roof of a dovecote—or perhaps a granary—with the midday sun on it；black kid gloves lying in a bureau drawer of walnut wood；a dusty road with a horses' drinking trough beneath the sycamores；little mushrooms bursting through the rotting leaves；and—and—and—”

“Any parsnips？”asked Gub-Gub．

“No，”said Jip．“You always think of things to eat．No parsnips whatever．And no snuff．Plenty of pipes and cigarettes and a few cigars．But no snuff．We must wait till the wind changes to the south．”

“Yes，it's a poor wind，that，”said Gub-Gub．“I think you're a fake，Jip．Who ever heard of finding a man in the middle of the ocean just by smell！I told you you couldn't do it．”

“Look here，”said Jip，getting really angry．“You're going to get a bite on the nose in a minute！You needn't think that just because the Doctor won't let us give you what you deserve，that you can be as cheeky as you like！”

“Stop quarreling！”said the Doctor．“Stop it！Life's too short．Tell me，Jip，where do you think those smells are coming from？”

“From Devon and Wales—most of them，”said Jip．“The wind is coming that way．”

“Well，well！”said the Doctor．“You know that's really quite remarkable—quite．I must make a note of that for my new book．I wonder if you could train me to smell as well as that…．But no，perhaps I'm better off the way I am．‘Enough is as good as a feast，’they say．Let's go down to supper．I'm quite hungry．”

“So am I，”said Gub-Gub．





CHAPTER XIX　THE ROCK


UP they got early next morning out of the silken beds，and they saw that the sun was shining brightly and that the wind was blowing from the south．

Jip smelt the south wind for half an hour．Then he came to the Doctor，shaking his head．

“I smell no snuff as yet，”he said．“We must wait till the wind changes to the east．”

But even when the east wind came，at three o'clock that afternoon，the dog could not catch the smell of snuff．

The little boy was terribly disappointed and began to cry again，saying that no one seemed to be able to find his uncle for him．But all Jip said to the Doctor was，“Tell him that when the wind changes to the west，I'll find his uncle even though he be in China，so long as he is still taking Black Rappee snuff．”

Three days they had to wait before the west wind came．This was on a Friday morning，early，just as it was getting light．A fine rainy mist lay on the sea like a thin fog．And the wind was soft and warm and wet．

As soon as Jip awoke he ran upstairs and poked his nose in the air．Then he got most frightfully excited and rushed down again to wake the Doctor up．

“Doctor！”he cried．“I've got it！Doctor！Doctor！Wake up！Listen！I've got it！The wind's from the west and it smells of nothing but snuff．Come upstairs and start the ship—quick！”

So the Doctor tumbled out of bed and went to the rudder to steer the ship．

“Now I'll go up to the front，”said Jip，“and you watch my nose—whichever way I point it，you turn the ship the same way．The man cannot be far off—with the smell as strong as this．And the wind's all lovely and wet．Now watch me！”

So all that morning Jip stood in the front part of the ship，sniffing the wind and pointing the way for the Doctor to steer，while all the animals and the little boy stood around with their eyes wide open，watching the dog in wonder．

About lunchtime Jip asked Dab-Dab to tell the Doctor that he was getting worried and wanted to speak to him．So Dab-Dab went and fetched the Doctor from the other end of the ship and Jip said to him，“The boy's uncle is starving．We must make the ship go as fast as we can．”

“How do you know he is starving？”asked the Doctor．

“Because there is no other smell in the west wind but snuff，”said Jip．“If the man were cooking or eating food of any kind，I would be bound to smell it too．But he hasn't even fresh water to drink．All he is taking is snuff—in large pinches．We are getting nearer to him all the time，because the smell grows stronger every minute．But make the ship go as fast as you can，for I am certain that the man is starving．”

“All right，”said the Doctor，and he sent Dab-Dab to ask the swallows to pull the ship，the same as they had done when the pirates were chasing them．

So the stout little birds came down and once more harnessed themselves to the ship．

And now the boat went bounding through the waves at a terrible speed．It went so fast that the fishes in the sea had to jump for their lives to get out of the way and not be run over．

And all the animals got tremendously excited，and they gave up looking at Jip and turned to watch the sea in front，to spy out any land or islands where the starving man might be．

But hour after hour went by，and still the ship went rushing on over the same flat，flat sea，and no land anywhere came in sight．

And now the animals gave up chattering and sat around silent，anxious and miserable．The little boy again grew sad．And on Jip's face there was a worried look．

At last，late in the afternoon，just as the sun was going down，the owl，Too-Too，who was perched on the tip of the mast，suddenly startled them all by crying out at the top of his voice，“Jip！Jip！I see a great，great rock in front of us．Look way out there where the sky and the water meet．See the sun shine on it—like gold！Is the smell coming from there？”

And Jip called back，“Yes．That's it．That is where the man is．At last，at last！”

And when they got nearer they could see that the rock was very large，as large as a big field．No trees grew on it，no grass—nothing．The great rock was as smooth and as bare as the back of a tortoise．

Then the Doctor sailed the ship right around the rock．But nowhere on it could a man be seen．All the animals screwed up their eyes and looked as hard as they could，and John Dolittle got a telescope from downstairs．

But not one living thing could they spy—not even a gull，nor a star-fish，nor a shred of sea-weed．

They all stood still and listened，straining their ears for any sound．But the only noise they heard was the gentle lapping of the little waves against the sides of their ship．

Then they all started calling，“Hulloa，there！HULLOA！”till their voices were hoarse．But only the echo came back from the rock．

And the little boy burst into tears and said，“I am afraid I shall never see my uncle any more！What shall I tell them when I get home！”

But Jip called to the Doctor，“He must be there—he must—HE MUST！The smell goes on no further．He must be there，I tell you！Sail the ship close to the rock and let me jump out on it．”

So the Doctor brought the ship as close as he could and let down the anchor．Then he and Jip got out of the ship onto the rock．

Jip at once put his nose down close to the ground and began to run all over the place．Up and down he went，back and forth—zigzagging，twisting，doubling and turning．And everywhere he went，the Doctor ran behind him，close at his heels，till he was terribly out of breath．

At last Jip let out a great bark and sat down．And when the Doctor came running up to him，he found the dog staring into a big，deep hole in the middle of the rock．

“The boy's uncle is down there，”said Jip quietly．“No wonder those silly eagles couldn't see him！It takes a dog to find a man．”

So the Doctor got down into the hole，which seemed to be a kind of cave，or tunnel，running a long way under the ground．Then he struck a match and started to make his way along the dark passage with Jip following behind．

The Doctor's match soon went out，and he had to strike another and another and another．

At last the passage came to an end，and the Doctor found himself in a kind of tiny room with walls of rock．

And there，in the middle of the room，his head resting on his arms，lay a man with very red hair—fast asleep！

Jip went up and sniffed at something lying on the ground beside him．The Doctor stooped and picked it up．It was an enormous snuff box．And it was full of Black Rappee！





CHAPTER XX　THE FISHERMAN'S TOWN


GENTLY then—very gently，the Doctor woke the man up．

But just at that moment the match went out again．And the man thought it was Ben Ali coming back，and he began to punch the Doctor in the dark．

But when John Dolittle told him who it was，and that he had his little nephew safe on his ship，the man was tremendously glad，and said he was sorry he had fought the Doctor．He had not hurt him much though—because it was too dark to punch properly．Then he gave the Doctor a pinch of snuff．

And the man told how the Barbary Dragon had put him on to this rock and left him there，when he wouldn't promise to become a pirate，and how he used to sleep down in this hole because there was no house on the rock to keep him warm．

And then he said，“For four days I have had nothing to eat or drink．I have lived on snuff．”

“There you are！”said Jip．“What did I tell you？”

So they struck some more matches and made their way out through the passage into the daylight，and the Doctor hurried the man down to the boat to get some soup．

When the animals and the little boy saw the Doctor and Jip coming back to the ship with a red-headed man，they began to cheer and yell and dance about the boat．And the swallows up above started whistling at the top of their voices—thousands and millions of them—to show that they too were glad that the boy's brave uncle had been found．The noise they made was so great that sailors far out at sea thought that a terrible storm was coming．“Hark to that gale howling in the east！”they said．

And Jip was awfully proud of himself—though he tried hard not to look conceited．

When Dab-Dab came to him and said，“Jip，I had no idea you were so clever！”he just tossed his head and answered，“Oh，that's nothing special．But it takes a dog to find a man，you know．Birds are no good for a game like that．”

Then the Doctor asked the red-haired fisherman where his home was．And when he had told him，the Doctor asked the swallows to guide the ship there first．

And when they had come to the land that the man had spoken of，they saw a little fishing town at the foot of a rocky mountain，and the man pointed out the house where he lived．

And while they were letting down the anchor，the little boy's mother （who was also the man's sister） came running down to the shore to meet them，laughing and crying at the same time．She had been sitting on a hill for twenty days，watching the sea and waiting for them to return．

And she kissed the Doctor many times，so that he giggled and blushed like a schoolgirl．And she tried to kiss Jip too，but he ran away and hid inside the ship．

“It's a silly business，this kissing，”he said．“I don't hold by it．Let her go and kiss Gub-Gub—if she MUST kiss something．”

The fisherman and his sister didn't want the Doctor to go away again in a hurry．They begged him to spend a few days with them．So John Dolittle and his animals had to stay at their house a whole Saturday and Sunday and half of Monday．

And all the little boys of the fishing village went down to the beach and pointed at the great ship anchored there，and said to one another in whispers，“Look！That was a pirate ship—Ben Ali's—the most terrible pirate that ever sailed the seven seas！That old gentleman with the high hat，who's staying up at Mrs．Trevelyan's，HE took the ship away from The Barbary Dragon—and made him into a farmer．Who'd have thought it of him—him so gentle—like and all！…Look at the great red sails！Isn't she the wicked-looking ship—and fast？My！”

All those two days and a half that the Doctor stayed at the little fishing town the people kept asking him out to teas and luncheons and dinners and parties；all the ladies sent him boxes of flowers and candies；and the village band played tunes under his window every night．

At last the Doctor said，“Good people，I must go home now．You have really been most kind．I shall always remember it．But I must go home，for I have things to do．”

Then，just as the Doctor was about to leave，the Mayor of the town came down the street and a lot of other people in grand clothes with him．And the Mayor stopped before the house where the Doctor was living，and everybody in the village gathered around to see what was going to happen．

After six page boys had blown on shining trumpets to make the people stop talking，the Doctor came out onto the steps and the Mayor spoke．

“Doctor John Dolittle，”said he，“it is a great pleasure for me to present to the man who rid the seas of the Dragon of Barbary this little token from the grateful people of our worthy town．”

And the Mayor took from his pocket a little tissue-paper packet，and opening it，he handed to the Doctor a perfectly beautiful watch with real diamonds in the back．

Then the Mayor pulled out of his pocket a still larger parcel and said，“Where is the dog？”

Then everybody started to hunt for Jip．And at last Dab-Dab found him on the other side of the village in a stable yard，where all the dogs of the country side were standing around him speechless with admiration and respect．

When Jip was brought to the Doctor's side，the Mayor opened the larger parcel，and inside was a dog collar made of solid gold！And a great murmur of wonder went up from the village folk as the Mayor bent down and fastened it around the dog's neck with his own hands．

For written on the collar in big letters were these words：“JIP—THE CLEVEREST DOG IN THE WORLD．”

Then the whole crowd moved down to the beach to see them off．And after the red-haired fisherman and his sister and the little boy had thanked the Doctor and his dog over and over and over again，the great swift ship with the red sails was turned once more towards Puddleby，and they sailed out to sea，while the village band played music on the shore．





CHAPTER XXI　HOME AGAIN


MARCH winds had come and gone；April's showers were over；May's buds had opened into flower；and the June sun was shining on the pleasant fields，when John Dolittle at last got back to his own country．

But he did not yet go home to Puddleby．First he went traveling through the land with the pushmi-pullyu in a gipsy-wagon，stopping at all the country fairs．And there，with the acrobats on one side of them and the Punch-and-Judy show on the other，they would hang out a big sign which read，“COME AND SEE THE MARVELOUS TWO-HEADED ANIMAL FROM THE JUNGLES OF AFRICA．Admission SIXPENCE．”

And the pushmi-pullyu would stay inside the wagon，while the other animals would lie about underneath．The Doctor sat in a chair in front taking the sixpences and smiling on the people as they went in；and Dab-Dab was kept busy all the time scolding him because he would let the children in for nothing when she wasn't looking．

And menagerie keepers and circus men came and asked the Doctor to sell them the strange creature，saying they would pay a tremendous lot of money for him．But the Doctor always shook his head and said，“No．The pushmi-pullyu shall never be shut up in a cage．He shall be free always to come and go，like you and me．”

Many curious sights and happenings they saw in this wandering life，but they all seemed quite ordinary after the great things they had seen and done in foreign lands．It was very interesting at first，being sort of part of a circus，but after a few weeks they all got dreadfully tired of it，and the Doctor and all of them were longing to go home．

But so many people came flocking to the little wagon and paid the sixpence to go inside and see the pushmi-pullyu that very soon the Doctor was able to give up being a showman．

And one fine day，when the hollyhocks were in full bloom，he came back to Puddleby a rich man，to live in the little house with the big garden．

And the old lame horse in the stable was glad to see him；and so were the swallows who had already built their nests under the eaves of his roof and had young ones．And Dab-Dab was glad too to get back to the house she knew so well—although there was a terrible lot of dusting to be done，with cobwebs everywhere．

And after Jip had gone and shown his golden collar to the conceited collie next door，he came back and began running around the garden like a crazy thing，looking for the bones he had buried long ago，and chasing the rats out of the tool-shed；while Gub-Gub dug up the horseradish which had grown three feet high in the corner by the garden-wall．

And the Doctor went and saw the sailor who had lent him the boat，and he bought two new ships for him and a rubber doll for his baby；and he paid the grocer for the food he had lent him for the journey to Africa．And he bought another piano and put the white mice back in it—because they said the bureau drawer was drafty．

Even when the Doctor had filled the old money box on the dresser shelf，he still had a lot of money left，and he had to get three more money boxes，just as big，to put the rest in．

“Money，”he said，“is a terrible nuisance．But it's nice not to have to worry．”

“Yes，”said Dab-Dab，who was toasting muffins for his tea，“it is indeed！”

And when the winter came again，and the snow flew against the kitchen window，the Doctor and his animals would sit around the big，warm fire after supper；and he would read aloud to them out of his books．

But far away in Africa，where the monkeys chattered in the palm trees before they went to bed under the big yellow moon，they would say to one another，“I wonder what The good man's doing now—over there，in the Land of the White Men！Do you think he ever will come back？”

And Polynesia would squeak out from the vines，“I think he will—I guess he will—I hope he will！”

And then the crocodile would grunt up at them from the black mud of the river，“I'm SURE he will—Go to sleep！”
