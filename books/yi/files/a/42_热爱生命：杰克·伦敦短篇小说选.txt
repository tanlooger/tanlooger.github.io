热爱生命：杰克·伦敦短篇小说选

序言


杰克·伦敦（1876—1916）是美国二十世纪现实主义文学的杰出代表。他的创作风格粗犷冷峻，有力地冲击了美国文坛上的浮华文风。其长篇小说《马丁·伊登》等具有深刻社会悲剧意义的现实主义作品，极大地影响了后来的作家们对“美国梦”的描写。他是这一时期美国最富有批判精神的现实主义作家，在美国文学史上素有“美国的高尔基”之称。

杰克·伦敦出生于一个贫苦家庭，自小衣不遮体、食不果腹，小学毕业后便进入社会谋生，当过报童和罐头厂的童工。在贫民窟里，他是个善于打架的“小霸王”，养成了坚毅、勇敢的性格。十七岁时，他上了一艘捕猎船做水手，经过朝鲜、日本，到西伯利亚去捕海豹，途中经受了严寒、风暴、最沉重的苦役的锻炼。他和极为强悍的水手交朋友，听他们讲述形形色色惊心动魄的人生经历。远航归来，他把自己的经历写成了一篇散文《日本港口的台风》，参加了《呼声》杂志的写作竞赛，因为内容独特且有一定深度和表现力，荣获第一名。刚开始写作便取得了这样突出的成绩，显然令他大为振奋，恐怕这也是他自此走上文学创作之路的重要原因之一。

父亲去世后，家里的生活愈加贫苦，为了负担家庭开支，杰克·伦敦四处找活干，尝尽了人间的辛酸。不过，他并没有因此而放弃文学创作，而是一边博览群书，一边笔不停辍地写作。可是，正如他在《马丁·伊登》中所描述的那样，他的稿件全部被出版社和杂志社退了回来。他没有灰心，仍在苦苦奋斗，为自己的创作寻找新的题材。最后，《大陆月刊》刊登了他的短篇小说《为赶路的人干杯》，给了他五美元的稿酬。正是这区区五美元解决了他生活上的燃眉之急，也坚定了他继续写作的信心。1897年3月，他踏上了淘金的路。他和伙伴们在育空河流域历经千辛万苦，差点没了命，却没有找到金子（他们倒是发现了金沙，其实那只是云母）。不过，这段经历却让他收获颇多，大大丰富了他的人生阅历。他把自己的所见所闻做了详细的笔记，那便是他后来发表的阿拉斯加小说的极其珍贵的材料。从育空河回来之后的几年里，他不断读书和写作，每天工作十九个小时。他阅读的范围非常广泛。在经济学方面他读亚当·斯密的《原富》、马尔萨斯的《人口论》、李嘉图的《分配论》、约翰·穆勒的《股份论》；在政治学方面他读亚里士多德的著作，读吉本的《罗马帝国衰亡史》，探索中世纪政治和教会的斗争；他读宗教改革的先驱马丁·路德和加尔文的作品，探索宗教对政治的影响；为了了解现代政治的起源，他阅读霍布斯、洛克和休谟的著作；在文学方面，他读英、法、俄、德各国名家的文学作品，还读各国的文学理论，寻求思想的解放。他最崇拜的作家是英国的斯蒂文森和吉卜林（英国第一个获得诺贝尔文学奖的作家）。他有着边读书边做笔记的习惯，不断摘取各个作者的名言，将其写在小纸条上，贴在房间里的各个地方，作为激励自己写作的动力。

1900年，杰克·伦敦的第一本小说集《狼子》出版，这立即为他赢得了巨大的声誉和优厚的收入。他原本可以在成功与安定的环境里继续从事写作，可是他是个不安分的人，血管里燃烧着火焰，总是渴望着沸腾的生活。1902年，为了拓宽视野，为了寻找更新的素材，他买了几套破旧的衣服、一双破鞋和一顶肮脏的便帽，以流落英伦的美国水手的身份住进了伦敦的贫民窟。在那里，他见到了大英帝国最繁华的城市伦敦的另一面——极为可怕的一面。疾病、失望和死亡是那儿居民生活里的家常便饭。那儿污水横流、垃圾遍地，不啻人间地狱。他发现了一个可怕的现实：英国的农村年复一年地把大量壮健的劳动力输入这里，而这些个体到第三代时就已经灭绝。他曾说过：“随时都有四五十万人在叫作伦敦的这个社会陷阱里悲惨地死亡。”他在伦敦东区的贫民窟住了三个月，在那儿读了几百本关于它的小册子、书籍和政府报告，访问了无数男男女女，拍了许多照片；他排过领救济面包的长队，住过济贫院，睡过街道和公园，看到了人们如何在肮脏不堪的生活环境里挣扎和死亡。回到美国后，他出版了《深渊里的人们》一书。这本书带给他的经济收入并不高，却让他在美国的社会主义者之间声名鹊起。在当时的美国，虽然倡导“言论自由”，然而主流社会却对“社会主义思想”持排斥态度。杰克·伦敦并不理会来自四面八方的批评，而是坚持自己的观点，公开表明自己拥护社会主义的态度。他到加州大学做讲演时，大力称赞社会主义，并用人类社会残酷的现实佐证自己的政治见解，结果遭到一些人的谩骂，幸好得到了主张言论自由的校长的保护。他还到商人俱乐部宣传社会主义革命，并把1905年俄国革命中曾杀死过几个沙皇官员的革命者称作自己的兄弟，随即引起轩然大波。第二天他就遭到各报的围攻，报纸上出现了愤怒的社论，说“杰克·伦敦把俄国杀人犯称作兄弟”。

杰克·伦敦一生著述颇丰，共创作了十九部长篇小说、一百五十多篇短篇小说以及大量文学报告集，还写了三个剧本以及相当多的随笔和论文。他的作品中最著名的有《马丁·伊登》《野性的呼唤》《白牙》等，还有本书所包含的《热爱生命》《生火》《墨西哥人》《一块牛排》《黄金谷》《为赶路的人干杯》以及《北方的奥德赛》。

《热爱生命》描述的是一个淘金者的故事。主人公独行于茫茫旷野上，他的同伴离他而去，使他陷于绝境之中。饥饿时时在考验着他的意志，威胁着他的生命。周围只可以看得到贫瘠的荒原，看不到可以果腹的东西，只能靠少之又少的难以下咽的浆果维系生命。后来，就连浆果也找不到了。就在生命即将消逝的时候，他遇到了一只生病的狼。他发现这只病狼跟在他的身后，舔着他的血迹尾随着他。就这样，两个濒临死亡的生灵拖着垂死的身躯，都想把对方作为自己的食物。为了活着回去，为了战胜这只令他作呕的病狼，他拖着虚弱到极点的身子，拼尽最后的一丝力气，将病狼咬死，喝了一些含有大量病菌的狼血，最终活了下来。这篇小说阐明了一个道理：只要有坚定的信念，一个人就可以战胜困难。生命是伟大的，而生命是靠信念支撑的！

《生火》这篇短篇小说，首先对极地环境进行了生动的描述。那儿是一片冰天雪地，气温极低，人和动物极难生存，每时每刻都跟死神相伴。主人公带着一只狗在冰原上艰难跋涉，呼出的热气立刻被冻成冰霜，然后飘落在地。可想而知，那该是多么寒冷！环境越是严酷，人和狗的生存愿望便越是强烈。他们最渴望的是生一堆火，能够暖一暖马上就要冻僵的手脚和身子，然而终难如愿。主人公企图将狗杀死，把自己那眼看就要冻坏的双手放在余温未散的狗的尸体里暖一暖。可是，狗看出了他的小算盘，急忙躲开。主人公经过顽强挣扎，最后还是冻死在了路上。这个故事本身就是典型的自然主义风格——自然环境是无情的，它不会因为人的需要而改变本质。小说通过细腻的描写展示了生命与死亡的大较量。人类固然有着强大的决心，大自然却是残酷的。相比之下，人是那般渺小！

《墨西哥人》以墨西哥革命为背景，讲述了一个名叫菲力普·利维拉的不满十八岁的墨西哥青年积极投身革命的故事。他不堪独裁政权的迫害，只身逃往美国洛杉矶，找到了流亡国外的墨西哥革命党人，以坚忍不拔的毅力，为祖国的革命事业做出了重大贡献。他在革命的紧要关头，为了给革命事业筹集资金，沉着、勇敢、机智地击败了美国一流拳击手。杰克·伦敦通过这篇小说表达了他对墨西哥人民反抗独裁政权的革命斗争的支持和同情，同时也对美国资产阶级社会的种族歧视表示了厌恶和谴责。

在杰克·伦敦的作品中，我们时常能感受到英雄主义情结。他塑造的各种各样的主人公，有的与严寒、饥饿、死亡殊死搏斗，有的与邪恶势力进行不屈不挠的斗争——无论什么样的主人公，胸腔里都跳动着一颗强大的“杰克·伦敦式的心脏”。从这本书的每一篇故事里，你都可以感受到这一点！

为赶路的人干杯


“你把它掺进去呀！”

“你听我说，基德，这味道太烈了些吧？威士忌加酒精就已经够呛了，要是再加上白兰地、胡椒汁和……”

“叫你掺你就掺。到底是谁在调制这鸡尾酒呢？”马拉摩特·基德透过一团团的水蒸气满脸慈祥地笑了笑，“孩子，你要是跟我一样在这儿待久了，天天吃野兔和鲑鱼腩度日，你就会明白一年一度的圣诞节是多么珍贵了。而过圣诞节没有喝到鸡尾酒，便等于是已经把洞挖到了岩床上，却连一条富矿脉也没有找到。”

“你说得很在理。”大吉姆·贝尔登很赞成基德的话。他的矿场在梅兹梅，这次是特地赶来过圣诞的。谁都知道，在过去的两个月里，他完全靠吃鹿肉过日子。“那次咱们在塔纳纳河畔自制烈酒喝，当时的情景你还没忘吧？”

“我想是不会忘的。伙计们，用糖和酸面团竟酿出了那样棒的烧酒，大家喝醉后大吵大闹着，那场景让人看了真痛快。当时，你还没有出生呢。”马拉摩特·基德说着，把头转向了年轻的采矿专家斯坦利·普林斯，此人来这儿刚满两年，“那个时候，这一带没有白种女人。梅森想娶露丝，而露丝的父亲是塔纳纳族的酋长，他反对他们的婚事，部落里其余的人也一个样。死脑筋吧？嘿，我用了我最后一磅糖，那是我一生中酿得最好的酒了。你真该看看那场追击，一路沿河岸而下，直至水陆联运点。”

“那个印第安女人后来怎么样啦？”高个子的法裔加拿大人路易斯·萨沃伊听得来了兴趣，开口问道。去年冬天在四十英里矿区时，他听说过这个胆大妄为的事件。

马拉摩特·基德天生就是一个擅长讲故事的人，于是便讲起了这个北方的洛钦瓦尔(1)的动人故事。一桩桩发生在北方的带着荒蛮气息的事件刺激着他的心房，勾起他对南方朦朦胧胧的思念，使他想到了那儿阳光普照的牧草地——那儿的生活总是给人以希望，而不只是一片与寒冷和死亡奋力抗争的荒芜。

“我们踏上育空河时，第一次融冰刚结束。”基德在故事的结尾处讲道，“部落里的追兵只比我们晚到了一刻钟，可正是这一刻钟使我们得以脱险。因为第二次融冰冲开了上游淤塞的冰块，把他们拦在了对岸。待到他们最终追到努克鲁克托的时候，全矿区的人都已经聚集在那里等着他们了。至于婚礼的情况，你还是问这位鲁博神父吧，当时是他主持的。”

这位耶稣会的神父听了，将烟斗从嘴边拿开，只是郑重一笑，以表达内心的喜悦，而新教徒和天主教徒则兴奋得鼓起了掌。

“太棒了！”路易斯·萨沃伊深受故事的浪漫情调感染，不由得高声叫了起来，“这个印第安小女子！我勇敢的梅森！太棒了！”

接着，当第一批盛满鸡尾酒的锡杯分配完毕后，“激情的贝特尔斯”匆匆站起身，亮开嗓子唱起了他最爱的祝酒歌：

有一个亨利·华德·比契尔，

还有主日学校的教员们，

他们喝着檫木根酿的酒呀，推杯把盏；

但你照样深信不疑，

要是给这种酒一个恰当的名称，

禁果佳酿就是它的美名。

啊，禁果佳酿就是它的美名！

酒乡的人一起高唱起来——

啊，禁果佳酿就是它的美名！

但你照样深信不疑，

要是给这种酒一个恰当的名称，

禁果佳酿就是它的美名！

马拉摩特·基德调制的那种令人振奋的混合酒起作用了。宿营地的人和过路的投宿客几杯酒下肚，顿时觉得浑身暖烘烘的，筋骨也舒展开了。大家围着餐桌，又是说笑，又是唱歌，又是讲述过去的冒险经历。他们来自五湖四海，互相敬着酒。英国人普林斯提议为“山姆大叔，新世界的早熟婴儿”(2)干杯；美国人贝特尔斯的祝酒词则是“为女王干杯，愿上帝保佑她”；萨沃伊和德国商人迈耶斯碰杯，为“阿尔萨斯-洛林”(3)干杯。

接着，马拉摩特·基德站起身，举杯在手，向防油纸糊的窗户望了一眼（窗上结的冰霜足足有三英寸厚），然后说道：“祝今夜赶路的人身强体健；愿他带有足够的干粮；愿拉雪橇的狗能坚持到底；愿他的火柴不湿，能点得亮篝火。”




啪！啪！就在这时，大家听见几声熟悉而悦耳的狗鞭响，爱斯基摩狗呜呜地号叫着，一辆雪橇嘎吱一声停在了木屋外。于是，大家止住了谈笑，等待着客人进屋来。

“是个老手，先顾狗，再顾他自己。”当他们听见了狗的撕咬声、像狼一样的嗥吠和痛苦的狺狺狂吠时，马拉摩特·基德悄声对普林斯说。他们耳朵灵敏，一听就知道来客正一边打退他们的狗，一边喂他自己的狗。

最后，大伙儿期盼已久的敲门声终于响起了，声音响亮、有力。来客走进门，被屋里的灯光照花了眼，便在门口停顿了片刻，屋里的人借此机会将他仔细打量了一番。但见他气宇轩昂，生得英俊潇洒，穿一身羊毛极地服和皮衣，个头有六英尺二三英寸高，肩膀宽度适中，厚胸脯，一张不留胡须的脸冻得通红，长长的眉毛和睫毛上都结满了白色冰碴子，狼皮大帽子的护耳同护颈都松松地敞开来，俨然就是一位从茫茫的夜幕里走出来的冰雪世界里的国王。他的短大衣外面系着一条子弹带，皮带上吊着两支大大的柯尔特(4)自动手枪和一把猎刀，手里拿着一根必不可少的狗鞭，还背着一支口径最大、式样最新的无烟步枪。随即，他走上前来，步子稳健、灵活，但仍看得出他已疲惫不堪。

屋里陷入了一阵尴尬的沉默，但他热诚地招呼了一声，“伙计们，你们好！”这一声很快缓解了气氛。紧接着，马拉摩特·基德跟他握了手。二人虽然从来没有见过面，可是久闻彼此大名，一见面就相互认了出来。做主人的二话不说，先给他介绍了在座的各位，又将一缸子酒塞到他手里，这才容他解释来意。

“有三个男人赶着八只狗拉的一辆篮子雪橇曾从此处路过。他们过去有多久了？”他问道。

“都过去两天了。你在追赶他们吗？”

“对，那是我的雪橇和狗。那几个坏家伙竟敢在我的眼皮底下把雪橇偷走。我追他们，已经缩短了两天的路程，再赶一程就追上了。”

“他们恐怕会动粗吧？”为了不使谈话中断，贝尔登开口问道，因为这时候，马拉摩特·基德已经把咖啡放在炉子上，正忙着煎腌猪肉和鹿肉呢。

这个陌生人意味深长地拍了拍他的左轮手枪。

“你什么时候离开道森(5)的？”

“十二点。”

“昨天夜里十二点？”贝尔登想当然地问。

“今天中午十二点。”

周围顿时响起一阵惊呼。这很棒了。此时刚到午夜，想不到他在十二个小时内竟然在冰雪覆盖的河道上跑了七十五英里的路，这可不是开玩笑的。

不过，大家很快就把话题转移了，有人回忆起了童年时候的事情。趁着那位年轻的陌生来客吃着这顿粗粝的饭食时，马拉摩特·基德仔细观察了一下他的面相，立刻断定这是一张正直、诚实、坦率的脸，他很是喜欢。此人年龄虽然不大，脸上却已有一道道辛勤劳作和历经艰险所留下的皱纹。虽然他言语之间不乏亲切感，休息时态度也显得很温和，但他那双蓝眼睛定会在一旦付诸行动，特别是遇到危险的时候，闪射出刚毅的光芒。那有力的下颚和方正的下巴显露出了他顽强、坚忍不拔、百折不挠的性格。不过，尽管他勇猛得像头雄狮，却带有一丝女性的温柔气质，这说明他有一颗多愁善感的心。

“我和我老婆就是这么结婚的。”贝尔登讲述完他那段激动人心的求偶过程，最后说道，“回到她家，她说道，‘爸爸，我们回来了。’‘老天会惩罚你的。’她父亲骂了她一句，然后转过身对我说，‘吉姆，把你那身漂亮衣服脱下来，快给我犁地去，吃饭前争取把那四十英亩地耕出来。’吩咐完我，他又对她说，‘还有你，萨尔，你给他们做饭去。’随后，他哼了声鼻子，吻了她一下。当时，就别提我有多高兴了。他见我仍没有下地去，就吼了起来，‘快去呀，吉姆！’我就连忙跑到谷仓里去啦。”

“你回美国，是有孩子在这儿等着你？”陌生客问道。

“没有。萨尔在有孩子之前就死了。也正是因为如此，我才来的。”说到这里，贝尔登神情恍惚地给烟斗点火，其实烟斗本来就没有熄灭。随后，他又高兴地问道：“你呢，陌生人，成家了吗？”

陌生客没吱声，默默地打开了怀表盖，将怀表从用作表链的皮带上摘下，递了过来。贝尔登挑亮那盏昏暗的油灯，细细看了看表匣里面，啧啧赞叹了几声，然后把怀表递给了路易斯·萨沃伊。后者看了，连呼了几声“我的天”，随即便转给了普林斯。只见普林斯双手发抖，眼睛里平添出几分温柔的神色。就这样，怀表在一双双粗硬的大手间传看着——里面镶着一张女人的照片，是这些男人酷爱的那种小鸟依人的女人，怀中还抱着一个婴儿。没有看到这“奇观”的人们顿起好奇之心，而看过的则沉默了下来，沉湎于对往事的回忆之中。这些汉子不怕面对饥饿的煎熬、疾病的折磨，也不怕暴死在荒野上和洪水里，可是这个陌生女子同孩子的照片却触动了他们的柔情，把他们变成了软弱的女人和孩子。

“还没见过小家伙呢——听她说是个男孩，已经两岁了。”陌生客收回他的宝贝怀表时说。他又恋恋不舍地多看了几眼那照片，才啪的一声合上了表盖，转过了脸去，然而却难掩眼中克制已久、夺眶而出的泪水。

马拉摩特·基德把他带到一张床前，要他睡下。

“四点整叫醒我。别误了我。”他说完这话，没一会儿，就疲倦地睡了过去，鼾声阵阵。

“天哪！真是条好汉，”普林斯说道，“赶狗跑了七十五英里，再睡三个小时，又上路。他是谁，基德？”

“他叫杰克·韦斯顿戴尔，来这儿混已有三年了，除了像牛马一样干活的名声之外，什么也没有捞到，运气要多坏有多坏。我以前并不了解他，后来是听希特卡·查理讲了他的事情。”

“真是不容易啊，把可爱的娇妻抛在家中，一个人在这个荒凉之地苦熬岁月，这鬼地方一年抵外面两年。”

“他的毛病在于太顽固，犟得像头牛。他两次下赌场，赢了不少钱，后来又都叫他输了个精光。”

这时，贝特尔斯一阵高歌打断了他们的谈话，照片所产生的效应也随之消失了。在觥筹交错的狂欢之中，大家很快就将常年吃猪狗食、干牛马活的艰难处境抛之脑后。唯独基德一人看起来心神不定，一次次焦虑地看表。后来，他戴上手套和海狸皮帽子跑到屋外，进了贮藏室，在那儿窸窸窣窣地忙碌起来。

他实在等不下去了，没有按指定的时间叫醒那位陌生客，而是提前了一刻钟。那个年轻的大个子浑身僵硬，给他使劲揉搓一通后才站立起来。他吃力地蹒跚着走出木屋，发现他的狗已套上了雪橇，一切都已准备妥当，只等他启程上路了。大家祝他好运，愿他尽快追上歹徒。鲁博神父匆匆为他祝福后，便急忙回到了木屋里，众人紧随其后。这也难怪，在零下七十四度的严寒中待久了，裸露在外的耳朵和手会被冻坏的。

马拉摩特·基德送他上了大路，诚挚地握住他的手，叮嘱了他几句。

“你在雪橇上会找到一百磅鲑鱼子，”基德说，“路上当狗粮，顶得上一百五十磅鱼。你也许指望在佩利能买到狗粮，其实是买不到的。”陌生客颇觉意外，眼睛里闪过一道光，但没有吱声。“在到五指河的路上，你连一口狗食和人粮也搞不到。中间有两百英里的路呢，非常难走。千万要当心三十英里河上没有结冰的地方，一定得抄近路，走巴尔杰湖上那条捷径。”

“这事你是怎么知道的？消息总不能比我来得还快吧？”

“我什么也不知道，而且，我也不想知道。不过，你追寻的那群狗根本不是你的，而是去年春天希特卡·查理卖给他们的。然而，希特卡·查理提到过你，说你是个正派人，他的话我相信。我观察了你的面相，我喜欢你的这张脸。我看得出——算了，该死的，你还是快点赶路吧，到海的那边去，回到你老婆身边吧。这里有……”说到此处，基德一把摘下手套，将钱袋掏了出来。

“不，我用不着。”陌生客颤抖着紧握住基德的手，滚滚的泪珠在他脸上结成了冰。

“路上别心疼狗，累倒一条就解下来，买新的替换上，每一磅也就值十美元嘛。在五指河、小鲑鱼河以及胡塔林卡都可以买得到的。小心别把脚弄湿，免得冻坏。”基德临分手时谆谆叮嘱，“行驶速度保持在一小时二十五英里以上。如果低于这个数，你就生一堆火，换换袜子，休息一下。”




陌生客走了可能还不到一刻钟，便传来了雪橇铃铛的叮当声——又有客人来了。门开了，一个西北地区的骑警走了进来，后面跟着两个驭狗的混血儿。这一行人跟韦斯顿戴尔一样，也是全副武装，也是满脸倦容。两个混血儿是惯于行路者，虽疲倦却不以为然。那位年轻的骑警则累得像是浑身散了架。是他那个种族坚忍不拔的精神一路支撑着他，只要他不倒下就不会停止前进的步伐。

“韦斯顿戴尔走了多久了？”他问道，“他在这儿歇过脚，是不是？”这一番问话简直是多余的，根据路上的雪橇印迹便可一目了然。

马拉摩特·基德给贝尔登丢了个眼色，后者会意，便搪塞地回答：“走了好一会儿啦。”

“听着，伙计，要说实话！”警察告诫道。

“你们好像是要抓他哟。他在道森犯什么事了？”

“他抢了哈利·麦克法兰四万美元，然后去太平洋港湾公司的商店换成了一张在西雅图支付的支票。要是我们不追上他，谁去阻止他兑换呢？他到底是何时离开这里的？”

马拉摩特·基德已向每个人都使过了眼色，所以大家都装得跟没事人一样，年轻的警察对上的是一张张面无表情的脸。

他大步走到普林斯面前，将问题抛给了普林斯。普林斯呆呆地望着这位同胞那张坦率、诚恳的脸，有点痛心，但回答时仍闪烁其词、支支吾吾的。

这时候，警察一眼瞧见了鲁博神父（他不能撒谎）。神父回答说：“他和他的狗在这儿休息了四个小时，是一刻钟之前离开的。”

“都走了一刻钟了，而且攒足了劲！上帝呀！”可怜的警察又累又失望，几近昏倒，踉跄着朝后退了几步，嘴里唠唠叨叨地说自己从道森赶过来，一口气跑了十个小时，拉雪橇的狗都累趴下了。

马拉摩特·基德递给他一缸子鸡尾酒叫他提提神。他一饮而尽，然后转身向门口走去，命令那两个驭狗人跟他一起上路。但屋里暖意融融，加上对于休息的渴盼太过强烈，于是二人费力地抗议着。基德是熟悉法语方言的，他不安地仔细听着。

驭狗人说狗已经累垮了，跑不了一英里地就得射杀西瓦施和巴贝特，其他狗也强不了多少，最好让人和狗都休息休息。

“能借我五条狗吗？”他转向马拉摩特·基德问道。

基德摇了一下头。

“我可以用康士坦丁上尉的名义给你开一张五千美元的支票——这是我的授权书——我得到了授权，可以酌情开支票的。”

基德再次无声地拒绝了。

“那我就要以女王的名义征用了。”

基德不相信他敢动真格的，便只是笑了笑，朝自己那装满长枪短枪的武器架瞅了一眼。那个英国人明白自己寡不敌众、无力回天，就扭转身，向门口走去。而两个驭狗人仍反对立刻动身。他气得冲到他们跟前，骂他们是娘儿们，是杂种。那个年纪比较大的混血儿站起来的时候，一张黝黑的脸被气得通红，咬牙切齿地回敬了几句狠话，抱怨他非得让领队的狗累断腿，最后葬身于雪原才肯罢休。

年轻的警察——聚集起全身的力气——迈着坚定的步子向门口走去，尽管他已疲惫不堪，却强装出精神抖擞的样子。人人都了解实际情况，不由对他那种不认输的韧劲肃然起敬。话虽如此，他却难掩从脸上掠过的一阵痛苦的表情。那些狗身上结满了冰霜，蜷缩着卧在雪里，它们已经无法站立了。驭狗人憋了一肚子气，残酷无情地用鞭子狠狠抽打它们，打得那些可怜的狗儿呜呜呜地哀号。后来，他们割断套索，把领队的狗巴贝特拖了出来，其他的狗才拉动雪橇，启程上路了。

“流氓、无赖、骗子！”“他妈的！真不是个东西！”“这个强盗！”“印第安人都不如！”屋里的人对那个陌生客骂不绝口，一个个义愤填膺——一是因为他们觉得自己受到了欺骗，二是由于他们认为北方的行为准则遭到了破坏（根据这一准则，诚实是至高无上的，最应该受到珍视）。“明明知道那小子行迹诡异，却还要帮他。”众人抱怨着，一齐将谴责的目光投向了马拉摩特·基德。正在屋角处照料巴贝特的基德见状便从那儿站了起来，把最后一点酒给大家斟上，要请大家饮完这最后一巡酒。

“今天晚上真冷呀，伙计们——冷到骨头缝里了。”他开始为自己辩解，但这一开场白显得牛头不对马嘴，“大家都是在风雪路上跋涉过的，其中滋味谁都清楚。一个人落难的时候，最怕的就是墙倒众人推。这件事，诸位只知其一不知其二。江湖上的人同吃一锅饭，睡觉时合盖一条毯子，这里边恐怕数杰克做得最好了。去年秋天，他把积攒下的四万美元交给乔·卡斯特尔，让卡斯特尔到加拿大边境跟前的自治领地购买采矿权。他原本是可以成为百万富翁的，可他却留在了圈城照料自己的一个患坏血病的朋友。你们猜猜卡斯特尔做了些什么！他跑到麦克法兰的赌场里，把赌注加到最大限额，一下子把钱全输光了。第二天有人发现他死在了雪地里。可怜的杰克本来打算今年冬天回家看望老婆和没见过面的孩子。要知道，他没有多拿，只拿走了卡斯特尔输掉的——那四万美元。事已至此，你们说说该怎么办呢？”

基德扫视了一眼围成一圈的“道德法官们”，见大家紧绷着的脸趋于缓和，便高举起酒杯说：“祝今夜赶路的人身强体健；愿他带有足够的干粮；愿拉雪橇的狗能坚持到底；愿他的火柴不湿，能点得亮篝火。愿上帝保佑他一路顺利，祝他好运气，愿他……”

“愿那个骑警迷路！”贝特尔斯举起空酒杯，跟大伙儿碰杯，嘴里大声叫道。

北方的奥德赛(1)


1


雪橇行走在路上，挽具咯吱作响，领头狗身上的铃铛发出叮当叮当的声音，这一切汇成了一首永恒的悲歌。然而，无论人还是狗，全都精疲力竭，默然无声。车道上满是新雪，使行路变得缓慢。他们远道而来，雪橇上满载猎杀的麋鹿，一只只冻得跟石头一样硬；雪橇陷在松软的雪地上，就是不肯前行，简直跟人一样倔强。天色渐晚，但今夜他们不准备半路宿营。白雪从静谧的空中落下——那不是雪花，而是晶莹剔透、小巧玲珑的水晶粒。天气很暖和——差不多也就是零下十度吧——大家并不把这种天气放在眼里。迈耶斯和贝特尔斯将帽子上的护耳翻上去，露出耳朵，马拉摩特·基德甚至摘下了手套。

狗儿早在下午就已疲惫不堪，此刻它们却又开始展现出新的活力。它们之中比较精明的狗已经开始躁动不安了——似乎难耐挽绳的束缚，渴望快速奔跑，却又犹豫不决，支棱起耳朵，呼哧呼哧用鼻子嗅探着。后来，它们迁怒于自己比较拖沓的伙伴们，动不动就咬伙伴们的后腿，催促它们加快步子。受到责备的狗像是得了传染病，接着又把这种病传染给其他的狗。最后，走在顶前边的那辆雪橇的领队狗发出一声兴奋的长吠，在雪地里俯下身子向前猛冲，将领圈拉得紧紧的，其余的狗也就紧跟着向前冲。只见雪橇皮带收紧、挽绳绷直，一辆辆像离弦的箭似的向前冲去。赶雪橇的人紧紧抓住辕杆，加速前进，免得被后边的雪橇撞倒。一天的疲倦霎时烟消云散，驭手们放开嗓门一声喊，给狗儿们加油，狗儿也发出快乐的汪汪声作为回应。人和狗一起发力，在越来越浓的暮色里奔走如飞。

“加油！加油！”驭手们你一声我一声地叫喊着，只见雪橇队突然离开大道，翘起一边的滑板，犹如一只只乘风破浪的帆船。

雪橇队向前冲了有一百码，在一扇羊皮纸糊的窗户跟前骤然停了下来，窗户内的灯光让木屋的情况显而易见——熊熊燃烧的育空(2)炉子和热气腾腾的茶壶。这座木屋来了不速之客。六十几条爱斯基摩狗气势汹汹地狂吠不已，这些毛茸茸的家伙一边叫一边张牙舞爪地朝第一辆雪橇的狗儿们扑了过来。屋门被猛地推开，一个穿着红色西北警察制服的人走了出来，踩着没膝深的雪走进发狂的爱斯基摩狗群里，用狗鞭的鞭柄抽打它们，态度冷静、公正，让它们一个个安静了下来。随后，他跟驭手们一一握手——马拉摩特·基德就是以这种形式被一个陌生人迎进了他自己的木屋。

按说，出来迎接的应该是斯坦利·普林斯——如前所言，普林斯留在木屋里负责照看火炉和烹茶。岂不知，此刻普林斯正在屋里忙着招待客人呢。总共有十来个客人，说不清身份，反正都是为女王效力的，有执法的，也有投递邮件的。他们血统各异，但相同的生活将他们铸造成了同一类型的人——身材瘦而结实，成块的肌肉线条分明；一张张脸被晒成了紫铜色；心灵纯净，目光清朗、坦荡。这些人驾着雪橇为女王而奔忙，令女王的敌人胆战心惊；他们吃的都是粗茶淡饭，心里却充满了欢乐。他们见过世面，创造过辉煌的业绩，成就过一段段传奇，然而他们自己却浑然不知。

他们显得悠闲自在，就像在自己家中一样。他们当中有两个人四肢伸展地躺在马拉摩特·基德的床上，嘴里哼唱着法国情歌——当初他们的法国先祖来到西北地区，和印第安女子成双配对时唱的就是这种歌。贝特尔斯的床铺也遭到了同样的侵占——但见三四个身强力壮的邮差身上捂着毯子，一边搓着脚丫子，一边在听一个人讲故事。讲述者曾经在沃尔斯利将军(3)的舰队里服过役，随沃尔斯利进攻过喀土穆(4)。等到他说累了，一个牛仔就讲起了当年自己跟随野牛比尔(5)游历欧洲各国首都的经历，说他们经常出入于宫廷，见到了许多王侯和贵妇人。木屋的一个角落里有两个混血儿，他们曾是战友，一道参加过一次最终失败了的战役。此时，他们修补着挽具，回忆着逝去的岁月，回忆着西北地区风起云涌的起义以及路易斯·里尔(6)称王的经历。

这些客人粗话不断，相互插科打诨，彼此开玩笑。他们用轻松的语气谈论自己在风雪路上以及大江大河上遭遇的艰险，就好像在说着家长里短——他们回忆这些往事，只是因为其中包含着滑稽或好玩的片段。这些无冕英雄见证了历史创造的过程，但在他们的眼里，那些伟大、传奇的事件只不过是日常生活里的平凡琐事，普林斯听他们讲述，不由心迷神往。他把自己珍贵的烟草毫不在乎地分给他们；为了报答他的热情招待，生了锈的回忆的锁链松开了，遗忘已久的奥德赛式的故事也复活了。

当谈话终止，客人们最后一次加满烟斗，解开捆得紧紧的毛皮铺盖卷准备睡觉时，普林斯掉过头来找老朋友基德，向他了解更多有关这些客人的情况。

“哦，那个牛仔的情况你已经知道了，”马拉摩特·基德一面回答，一面动手解开他的鹿皮鞋的带子，“和他一块儿躺在床上的那个伙计有点英国血统，这不难看得出。至于其他人，全都是森林里的好汉，血缘关系复杂得只有老天才知道。靠近门口睡的那两个，却是地地道道的‘法种’，或称‘森林小子’(7)；那个围着绒线围巾的小伙子——你只要看看他的眉眼和下巴——一定是哪个苏格兰男人到过他妈妈那烟雾腾腾的帐篷后才有的他；那个把斗篷枕在头下的帅气小伙子有一半法国血统——他刚才说的话你也听到了，他不喜欢那两个睡在他旁边的印第安人。要知道，当初这些‘法种’在里尔的领导下起义的时候，纯种的印第安人并没有响应，自那以后，他们之间的感情就大不如以前了。”

“我说，炉子旁边那个阴沉着脸的伙计是什么情况？他肯定不会说英语，一晚上连口都没有开过。”

“错了。他的英语很棒。他听别人讲话，你注意到他的眼神了没有？我注意到了，他显然跟其他人并非乡亲同胞，那些人一说家乡话你就可以看得出他听不懂了。我也搞不清他究竟是什么情况，现在咱们就弄他个水落石出吧。”

“请你给炉子里添几根柴！”马拉摩特·基德提高嗓门，眼睛盯着那个不明身份的人喊了一声。

那人照着做了。

“他显然受过训练，习惯于遵守命令。”普林斯小声嘀咕道。

马拉摩特·基德点了点头，脱下袜子，然后小心地从躺下来休息的人们中间穿过，走到炉子跟前，把他的湿袜子和另外二十多双同样的袜子挂在了一起。

“你估计什么时候能赶到道森？”他搭讪着问。

那人先看了他几眼，然后才回答道：“他们说还有七十五英里。是这样吧？我估计还要两天。”

可以听出他的口音带有一丁点儿地方腔，但说话脱口而出，没有为斟词酌句打绊。

“以前来过这一带吗？”

“没来过。”

“去过西北地区吗？”

“去过。”

“是那里出生的？”

“不是。”

“哦，那你究竟是哪里人？你跟他们不是同一类人。”马拉摩特·基德说着，用手泛泛指了指那些驭狗人，连睡在普林斯床铺上的那两个警察也包括了进去，“你到底是何方神圣？你这样的脸我是见过的，只是记不清在什么地方了。”

“我知道你。”那人答非所问地说，一下子就把马拉摩特·基德的问题岔开了。

“在哪儿？你见过我？”

“不是你，是你的牧师朋友。那是很久以前的事了，在帕斯蒂里克。他曾问过我，问我认不认识你，马拉摩特·基德。他给了我一点干粮。我在那地方没有久留。你听他提起过我吗？”

“噢，想起来了！你就是那个用海獭皮换狗的人？”

那个人点点头，磕了磕烟斗，把里面的灰磕出来，然后把皮毛毯子在身上裹紧，表示谈话到此结束。马拉摩特·基德将那盏昏暗的油灯吹灭，钻到毯子下和普林斯躺在了一起。

“怎么样？他是干什么的？”

“还不清楚——他把我的问题岔开了，真是守口如瓶啊。他这种人会叫你顿起好奇之心。对于他，我是有所耳闻的。八年前他去海边，那里的人不了解他的身份，觉得他是个神秘人物。他在寒冬腊月打北方来，千里迢迢，沿着白令海峡南下，风风火火的，好像有鬼在追他似的。他到底来自何处，无人知晓，只知道他来自很远的地方。他抵达戈洛文湾时已经累坏了，从瑞典传教士那儿搞到一点食物，问了问南下的路便又走了。这些都是我们事后听说的。后来，他横渡诺顿湾，离开了海岸线。当时雪骤风急，天公不作美，可他坚持到底，一路前行。他未能在圣迈克尔斯上岸，于是最后到了帕斯蒂里克。要是换上别人，早就去见阎王爷了。那一路，他失去了一切，只剩下两条狗，自己也差一点饿死。

“鲁博神父见他急着赶路，就给了他一点干粮，可是说什么也不愿把狗给他，因为等我一到，神父自己也要出行呢。那位尤利西斯(8)先生心里非常清楚，没有狗他是无法上路的。于是，他盘桓数日，四处想办法。他的雪橇上有一捆硝得很好的海獭皮——要知道，海獭皮的价值等同于黄金。当时，帕斯蒂里克有个俄国商人，简直就是个老年夏洛克(9)，他正好有几条狗预备宰杀。结果，他们没用多长时间就把这笔生意谈妥了。当那位神秘人物再次登程南下时，有了一队奔跑如飞的狗，而那位夏洛克先生得到了一批海獭皮。海獭皮我可是亲眼看了，真是上等货色。据估算，每条狗至少让那位夏洛克先生赚了五百块。这倒不是说那位神秘人物不懂得海獭的价值——他好歹也是个懂行的印第安人，虽说话不多，却也听得出他是跟白人打过交道的。

“海上的冰融化以后，努尼瓦克岛(10)有人过来说他曾到岛上找过干粮，后来就不见了踪影。此后八年他如同石沉大海，音讯全无，现在却突然出现在这里。他是从哪里冒出来的呢？来此处干什么？有什么目的？他是个印第安人，神出鬼没的，而且受过训练，这在印第安人中是很少见的。普林斯，这又是北方的一个谜团，等着你去破解呢。”

“多谢器重。不过我手头的事情太多，恐怕忙不过来。”普林斯回答说。

没等他把话说完，马拉摩特·基德已经鼾声如雷了。而这位年轻的采矿工程师则心潮起伏，睁大眼睛望着那茫茫的夜色，在等待着激荡的思绪平复下来。后来，他总算睡着了，可是大脑仍很活跃，梦见自己游荡于一片不知名的白雪皑皑的荒原上，和雪橇狗一起跋涉在永无尽头的道路上，沿途目睹人们如何在活着时备受苦难，又如何勇敢地走向死亡。




第二天一早，离天亮还有几个小时，几个驭狗人便和警察动身往道森去了。尽管如此，当局只关心女王陛下的利益，他们掌控着她之下的那些小人物的命运，途中也没让邮差们好好休息。一个星期后，他们赶到了斯图尔特河，雪橇上满载着送往盐湖的邮件。拉雪橇的狗换了班，邮差却仍是原班人马。

他们原指望能休息几天，放松放松。此外，克朗代克是北方地区新建起来的城市，大家都渴望领略一下这座黄金城的风采——此处的金砂似泉水一般源源不断，歌舞笙箫彻夜不息。然而，他们却只能烤一烤湿袜子，在暮色里用烟斗抽几口烟，跟上一趟来时一样情绪低落。有一两个胆大的动起了逃跑的念头，盘算着翻越人迹罕至的落基山到东边去，再经过麦肯齐山谷前往齐普砚地区，那儿是他们的常来常往之地。另外有两三个人也在打着自己的小算盘，决定合同期满后回家去，也走同一条路线；他们对这趟充满艰辛的返乡之旅满怀期待，激动得就像城里人期待着到林间度假一样。

那个曾拿海獭皮换狗的人显得心神不定，对周围人的谈话一点不感兴趣。后来，他把马拉摩特·基德拉到一边，叽叽咕咕小声说了一会儿话。普林斯瞅着他们，心里充满了好奇，见他们戴上帽子和手套出了门，就更觉得他俩的行踪神秘兮兮的了。俩人回来后，马拉摩特·基德将一杆金秤放在桌上，称出六十盎司的碎金放进那个神秘人物的口袋里。驭狗人的头头随即也加入了他们的密谈，几个人进行了一场交易。第二天，雪橇队朝着大河的上游进发，而那个曾拿海獭皮换狗的人却带上几磅重的干粮，独自返回道森去了。




事后，当普林斯问起，马拉摩特·基德回答说：“真是叫人摸不着头脑，但那个可怜的家伙出于某种原因，想摆脱现在的工作——至少对他而言那原因极为重要，只是他死活不愿挑明。要知道，干这一行犹如服兵役，随便不得。他签了两年的合同，重获自由的唯一途径就是出钱赎身。他不能逃跑，不然他就不能再留在这儿了，可他偏偏又十分渴望留在这个地区。据他说，他一到道森就打定主意扎根于此了，只可惜他囊中羞涩，又举目无亲，我是唯一一个他还说过几句话的人。他和副总督交涉过，说好只要从我这儿借到钱便可以赎身。他说年内便能将钱还清，还说如果我愿意，可以为我指出一条发财之路。他说他自己虽然并没有亲眼见过，却知道那是一条铺满了黄金的道路。

“实不相瞒，他把我拉到外边时都快要哭了，跪倒在雪地里苦苦哀求我，直到我把他硬拉了起来。他像个疯子一样，唠唠叨叨说个没完。他对天发誓，说他为了实现这一目标已奋斗多年，如希望落空，定会令他生不如死。我问他是什么目标，他却不肯说，只说生怕当局会叫他去另一条道上运送邮件，两年内回不了道森，那时他的目标就实现不了了。我这一辈子从没见过有谁竟如此伤心，便答应借钱给他，并又一次将他从雪地里拽了起来。我跟他说，让他把这笔钱当作我的一份股金。你猜他同意了吗？不！他发誓要把他赚得的财富全部给我，让我享受连做梦也想不到的富有。反正，他的好话说了一大篓子。一个人为了筹得做事的本钱，会绞尽脑汁、不择手段，可是一旦成功，叫他分一半红利给投资人通常也是很难的。这是经验之谈，普林斯，你可要记好了。他要是留在本地区不走，咱们会听到他的下文的。”

“他要是一拍屁股走了呢？”

“那就是我的好心没有得到好报，那六十盎司的金子全当打水漂了。”




严寒袭来，随之而至的还有漫漫的长夜，太阳在南方雪野的地平线那儿又玩起了亘古不变的躲猫猫游戏。马拉摩特·基德的那笔款子仍没有下落。后来，在一月初的一个阴冷的上午，几辆满载货物的狗拉雪橇停在了他那位于斯图尔特河下游的木屋门前。雪橇上坐着那个用海獭皮换狗的人，同来的还有一个身材高大的人（上帝恐怕也记不清自己怎么会造出了一个这样的人来）。一旦说起运气、胆量和一铲就铲出价值五百美元的金砂的趣闻，人们总会提到阿克塞尔·冈德森的大名；在营火边，每当大家议论起勇气、力量和天不怕地不怕的精神，也必定会讲到他的事迹。一旦谈兴低落，只要一提跟他同甘共苦的那个女人，人们的谈话就一定会变得又热烈起来。

显然，上帝在创造阿克塞尔·冈德森时，运用了远古时期的手法，将其塑造成了洪荒时代的那一类人。他身材魁伟，足足有七英尺高，衣着华贵，俨然一副黄金国国王的派头。他的胸脯、脖子和手脚都跟巨人一样。连骨头带肉有三百磅重，脚上的雪鞋比别人的要长出一码多。他方鼻阔嘴，有着一双无所畏惧的淡蓝色眼睛，一看面相就知道是个天不怕地不怕的主儿。他的头发结着冰霜，黄黄的，像熟透了的玉米须扫过黝黑的脸膛，犹如阳光穿过了黑夜，一直披到他的熊皮袄上。只见他一马当先，身后领着一队雪橇狗，沿着狭窄的小道虎虎生风地走了过来，身上隐约有一股海上霸王的劲儿。他用狗鞭的鞭柄猛敲马拉摩特·基德的房门，简直就像是个北欧海盗南下抢劫，正恶狠狠地把城堡的大门擂得山响。

普林斯挽起袖子，露出他细皮嫩肉的胳膊，一边揉面团一边不住地斜瞟着来客——这三位客人一起光临，此情此景一生一遇。对于那个神秘人物（马拉摩特·基德戏称之为尤利西斯），他仍然兴趣不减，但更叫他感兴趣的则是阿克塞尔·冈德森和他的妻子。赶了一天的路，女人已倦容满面。自从她的丈夫找到了富矿脉，发了大财，她就变得娇气了，过惯了养尊处优的日子，也就容易感到累了。她依偎在丈夫宽阔的胸脯上，就像一朵娇弱的鲜花靠在墙上，一边懒洋洋地回应着马拉摩特·基德善意的玩笑，一边时不时地用她那深深的黑眼睛扫一眼普林斯，惹得普林斯热血沸腾。普林斯毕竟是个男人，身体健康，已经一连好几个月都没见上个女人。这个女人虽说比他大，又是个印第安种，但她不同于他所见过的那些印第安婆娘，她是个见多识广的女性——根据她的谈吐看得出，她不仅去过丈夫的国家，还去过许多其他国家。白种女人懂得的事情，她几乎全懂，此外还懂得许多白种女人不懂的事情。用晒干的鱼她就能做出一顿饭，在雪地里也能搭一张床，然而她喜欢拿男人们开涮，故意津津乐道地说出许多盛宴上的菜名，挑动听者肚子里的馋虫——那些菜名是旧时的回忆，他们几乎已经淡忘。对于鹿、熊和小蓝狐的生活习性，她了如指掌，也非常熟悉北方海洋里野生两栖动物的情况。无论是森林狩猎还是江河行船，她样样精通；无论是人的足迹还是鸟兽的爪印，她都一看便知。普林斯还注意到她在看他们的营地规则时眼里露出了赞赏的目光。这套规则是“激情的贝特尔斯”在情绪激动之时拟定出来的，言简意赅、诙谐幽默，每次有女士前来，他都会把它翻过去，免得叫她们看了尴尬。谁料到这个土著女子竟然……唉，说什么也晚了。

阿克塞尔·冈德森的贤内助就是这么一个人。她的名字与传说和她的丈夫一起，在整个北方广为流传。进餐时，马拉摩特·基德仗着自己是多年的老朋友，老是取笑她，普林斯一改初见时的腼腆，也跟着插科打诨。她虽以一敌二，但不甘示弱，丈夫不善言辞，无法加入智斗，只能为她喝彩助阵。阿克塞尔·冈德森颇为妻子感到自豪，从他的每一个眼神、每一个动作都可以看得出妻子在他的生活中占有重要的位置。那个用海獭皮换狗的人只顾不声不响地吃饭，在这场热闹的交锋中竟然被大家忘记了。没等其他人吃完，他就早早退了席，到外边去照料雪橇狗了。没过多大一会儿，他的伙伴们戴上帽子，穿上毛皮大衣，也跟了过去。

多日没有下雪，育空大道的路面被冻得硬邦邦的，雪橇行走在上面毫不费力，犹如滑行在冰面上。尤利西斯驾着第一辆雪橇领头，普林斯和阿克塞尔·冈德森的妻子驾第二辆紧随其后，马拉摩特·基德则和这位黄发巨人驾第三辆押后阵。

“虽然这只是一种‘预感’，基德，”他说道，“但我觉得还是靠谱的。那地方他从来都没有去过，可是他说得有鼻子有眼，而且还让我看了地图——那地图多年前我在库特尼地区早已有所耳闻。我倒是很想叫你一块入伙，可是他是个怪人，把话说得很死：如果有任何别的人插手此事，那他会就此作罢。不过等我回来，我会让你第一个尝到甜头的。我将把我旁边的那个矿分给你，而且把城建基金的股份分一半给你。”

“别说啦！别说啦！”他见对方想说客气话，便提高了嗓门说道，“这事由我做主。再说，事成之前，我有问题还要和你商量呢。假如一切顺利，那儿就成了第二个克里普尔克里克(11)了。听清楚了吗，伙计？第二个克里普尔克里克！要知道，那可是石英矿，而非砂矿。如果干得顺手，那儿就成了摇钱树，赚个几百万不在话下。那地方我以前就听人说过，所以你应该也不会陌生。到时候，咱们叫一座城市拔地而起，那儿有成千上万的工人、优良的水道、轮船、繁忙的运输生意，有小火轮往上游一趟趟运货，也许咱们还要修铁路，建锯木厂和发电站，还要有自己的银行、贸易公司，成立辛迪加(12)……想想吧！此事必须保密，等我回来再说！”

几辆雪橇停了下来，前面的路要穿过斯图尔特河的河口。眼前是一片茫茫无际的冰雪世界，一直向神秘的东方延伸。他们把捆在雪橇上的雪鞋解了下来。阿克塞尔·冈德森跟大家握了握手，然后走到了前边去。他那巨大的蹼足似的雪鞋踩进柔软如羽毛般的雪里，陷下去足有半码多深，把雪压得实实的，好让雪橇狗行走。他的妻子跟在最后一辆雪橇后面，脚上穿着沉重的雪鞋，却显得轻巧，一看便知是长年锻炼出来的。朋友间几声愉快的告别打破了雪野的沉寂；雪橇狗汪汪地叫着。那个曾用海獭皮换狗的人，正挥鞭教训一只倔强的狗。

一个小时之后，他们出发上路了，雪橇犹如黑色的铅笔，在巨大的白纸上画出一条长长的直线。

几个星期之后的某天晚上，马拉摩特·基德和普林斯见一本旧杂志上有棋谱，便把那一页撕下来埋头研究起来。基德才从他的博南扎矿山回来，打算好好休息一下，为之后的长长的猎鹿季做好准备。普林斯不是在江河上行船就是奔走于雪野之上，忙碌了几乎一个冬天，也想躲在木屋里享受一个星期的清福。

“看这黑棋子，跳马将军。不行，这是一步败棋。瞧，下一步……”

“为什么要让卒子进两步呢？应该叫卒子过界河，把象吃掉……”

“且慢！这样一来，防线就会有一个缺口了……”

“别担心，不会有缺口的。放心好啦！你会明白这是一步高棋。”

这盘棋真是妙趣横生。外边有人敲门，等到敲门声第二次响起时，马拉摩特·基德才说了声“请进”。房门猛地被推开了，有一个“东西”摇摇晃晃地走了进来。普林斯迎面一看，不由得跳了起来，眼里显露出惊恐的神情，马拉摩特·基德见了，急转过身去看个究竟。这一看不当紧，虽说他是见过不少恐怖场面的，却也被吓得不轻。那“东西”不管这一套，踉踉跄跄向他们逼近。普林斯慢慢向后退去，一直退到了挂着他那把史密斯-威森(13)手枪的地方。

“天呀！这是什么东西？”他悄声问马拉摩特·基德。

“不清楚。看样子像是又冻又饿。”基德一边回着话，一边悄悄地朝着对面的那个方向摸去。“小心点！这家伙也许是个疯子。”他走过去关好门，回来时警告道。

那“东西”向桌子跟前走去，油灯的亮光照在它的眼睛上。它显然很高兴，发出一阵怪异的咯咯声，表达着内心的喜悦。普林斯和基德发现那“东西”竟然是个人。只见那人朝后一晃身子，把手插在皮裤上，唱起了水手的起锚歌，就像这时有人正升起船帆，转动绞盘，耳边涛声阵阵：

美国船，顺流而下，

能干的小伙子呀！拉呀拉！

你想知道船长是谁吗？

能干的小伙子呀！拉呀拉！

他就是江奈生·琼斯，来自于南卡罗来纳

能干的小伙子呀！拉呀拉！

……

他唱了半截便戛然而止，像狼一样嗥叫一声，摇摇晃晃朝食品架子那儿走过去，未等他们反应过来，就已经把牙齿咬进了一块生腌肉里。马拉摩特·基德想夺下那块肉，于是二人进行了一场激烈的争斗。后来，陌生人的疯劲倏然消失了，真是来得快，去得也快。他有气无力地交出了那块生腌肉。基德和普林斯把他架到一张凳子上——他坐在那里，半个身子趴在桌子上。一小杯威士忌落肚，他有了些精神。马拉摩特·基德把糖罐拿来，由着他用勺子舀着吃。待他的胃里有了点东西，普林斯哆嗦着手，端给他一杯淡牛肉茶。

那家伙的眼睛里闪射出一种阴沉、疯狂的光，一明一暗的，每喝一口茶就会随之一闪。他的脸瘦得皮包骨头，脸颊深陷，简直没有了人形。无尽的霜冻给他的脸留下了刀刻一般的痕印，旧伤未好又添新疤。又干又硬的皮肤透着血黑色，几条深深的锯齿形裂痕中露出红的血肉。他的毛皮衣又脏又破，一边的毛已经烧焦，有几处烧出了缺口——显然是他曾挨着火睡觉才导致了这样的后果。

马拉摩特·基德望着他那被太阳晒黑了的毛皮衣服，用手指了指他衣服上被用刀子割成一条条的地方（这是饥饿留下的可怕标志(14)），一字一顿、清清楚楚地问道：“你是何人？”

那人充耳不闻，并未搭理。

“你是从哪儿来的？”

“美国佬的船，顺流而下。”他声音颤抖地唱了一句，算是答复。

“毫无疑问，这个叫花子一定是从河的上游过来的。”基德对普林斯说道，同时扳着来客的身子把他晃了晃，想让他回答得明白些。

谁知这一晃，那人竟尖叫起来，用手捂住腰，显然那里很痛。接着，他慢慢站了起来，身子半倚在桌上。

“她嘲笑我……是这样的……她的眼睛里充满了仇恨……她硬是不肯来……”

他说着说着便没有了声，身子向后倒去，马拉摩特·基德一把抓住他的手腕，大着嗓门问道：“你在说什么人？谁硬是不肯来？”

“我说的是她——乌恩卡。她嘲笑我，打我，情况就是这样。后来……”

“后来怎么啦？”

“后来……”

“后来到底怎么啦？”

“后来他就一动不动躺在雪地里，躺了很长时间，现在还躺在那儿。”

马拉摩特·基德和普林斯面面相觑，简直听不明白。

“到底是谁躺在雪地里呀？”

“是她——乌恩卡。她看着我，眼睛里充满了仇恨。后来……”

“说呀，说呀！”

“后来她拿起刀子刺来……一下，两下……可是她已经虚弱得没有了力气。路上我走得非常慢。那儿遍地黄金，简直多极了。”

“乌恩卡现在在何处？”马拉摩特·基德总算听出了些名堂，猜想那个女子可能就躺在一英里以外的某个地方。他狠劲摇晃来客，一遍又一遍地问：“乌恩卡现在在何处？乌恩卡是谁？”

“她在……在……在雪地里。”

“往下说！”基德狠狠地握紧对方的手腕说。

“我……我原本……原本也想躺在雪地里。可是，我有一笔债……有一笔债要还。我有一笔债……有一笔债要还。我必须……”来客语无伦次，断断续续说到这里，把手伸进旅行袋里，摸出一个鹿皮口袋，“这里是五……五磅金子……是还给……还给马拉摩……马拉摩特·基德的债款。”话刚说完，他就一头栽倒在桌子上，马拉摩特·基德再怎么扶也扶不起来了。

“他是尤利西斯，”马拉摩特·基德把那袋金子扔到桌子上，平静地说，“看来，阿克塞尔·冈德森和那个女人凶多吉少。来，咱们把他抬到床上，给他盖上毯子暖暖。他是印第安人，缓一缓就没事了，那时再让他把来龙去脉讲清楚。”

他们把他身上的衣服割下来，发现他胸口的右侧有两处没有愈合的刀伤，伤口已经结痂了。

“我将照我自己的方式讲述这一切，但你们会明白的。我将从头说起，先说说我和那个女人，然后再说那个男人吧。”

这个曾用海獭皮换狗的人向火炉靠近了一点，就像是一个被剥夺了烤火权利的人一样，生怕普罗米修斯(15)的这份礼物会随时消失。马拉摩特·基德挑亮油灯，把它挪了个位置，让灯光可以照在讲述人的脸上。普林斯也把身体从床边挪过来，凑近倾听。

“我叫纳斯，是个酋长，父亲也是酋长。我是在日落以后，日出之前，在黑沉沉的大海上，在我父亲的皮舟上出生的。那天夜里，男人奋力划桨，女人们则把冲进舟里的海水舀出去，大家拼全力和暴风雨搏斗。海水溅在我母亲的胸口上结成了冰，待风浪退去，她的呼吸也随之停止了。而我……在大风大浪里啼哭不止，然而却活了下来。

“我们的居住地是阿卡坦……”

“那是个什么地方？”马拉摩特·基德问道。

“阿卡坦属于阿留申群岛。那个地方比契格尼克岛、卡尔达拉克岛以及乌尼马克岛都要远。我们居住的那个地方处于茫茫的大海之中，简直就是世界的边缘。我们在海上捕鱼，捉海豹和海獭。我们的住房建在森林与沙滩之间的一座条状石山上，一家一家挨在一起，黄黄的沙滩上停放着我们的皮舟。我们的人数不多，活动的范围极其狭小。我们东面有几座陌生的岛——都跟阿卡坦一样。因此，我们就以为全世界到处都是岛屿，并对此不以为意。

“我跟族里的人有所不同。有一天，一条船被冲上了沙滩，只剩了几根弯曲的船骨和几块被海浪冲翘了的船板——我族里的人从来也没造过这样的船；山顶上有一棵松树，那棵树直直的，挺拔、高大，从那儿的三个方向都可以瞭望大海，我记得这棵树也是岛上从前没有的。据说，有两个陌生人在那里转悠来转悠去，从白天到黑夜，许多天徘徊不去。这两人乘船而来，他们的船被浪打翻，残骸被冲到了沙滩上。他们跟你们一样是白人，当时身体虚弱，就像空手而归的海豹猎手家饿扁了肚子的小孩。这些事情我是听一些老头老太太们讲的，而他们也是从父辈那儿听来的。起初，那两个白人不习惯我们的生活方式，但他们吃了我们的鱼和鱼油后，身体变得强壮了起来，而且十分凶猛。他们各自盖了房，挑漂亮的女人为妻，并生了孩子，其中一个孩子就是我的曾祖父。

“我刚才说过，我跟族里的人有所不同，因为我身上流淌着那个乘船而来的强壮而奇异的白种人的血液。据说那两个白人来之前，我们族里有自己的规矩，可他们性情暴烈，喜欢寻衅滋事，老是跟族里的人打架，最后谁也不敢招惹他们了。于是，他们就自封为酋长，取消了我们的老规矩，并且给我们定下了新规矩，将我们以前以母亲为家主的规矩改成了以父亲为家主。他们还规定：头生的儿子有权继承父亲的一切，他的弟弟和姐妹都得自谋生计。除此之外，还有一些别的规矩也是他们定的。他们教给我们捕鱼和猎熊的新方法（那时森林里熊满为患）；他们还教我们多多储备食物，以防荒年的到来。这些都是好事。

“可是，当他们当上酋长，再也没有人敢惹怒他们后，这两个怪异的白人彼此打了起来。其中的一个，也就是我身上流着他的血的那个人，把刺海豹的鱼叉扎进了另一个白人的身体，扎进去有一胳膊那么深。双方的子女继承了这场仇杀，深仇大恨子孙相传，两家之间常常制造流血事件，甚至到了我这一代仍旧怨恨难释，以致两家各自都只剩下了一根独苗传宗接代。我们家族只剩了我一个人，对方家族只剩下了一个独生女，那就是乌恩卡。她和她的母亲在一起生活。一天夜里，她的父亲和我的父亲出海捕鱼，再也没有回来。后来，他们的尸体被大潮冲上了沙滩，二人至死还紧紧扭打在一起。

“人们见我们两家宿怨太深，都嗟叹不已。老人们直摇头，说乌恩卡的子孙后代和我的子嗣还将继续仇杀。我小的时候听他们这么说，后来竟笃信不疑，将乌恩卡视为仇敌，深信她的孩子会和我的子女进行厮杀。此事我天天都在想，百思不得其解，长大后询问为何会出现这种情况，老人们的回答是：‘我们也不清楚，反正你们的父辈就是这个样。’我不明白为什么前人已逝，后人还要继承旧怨，觉得这样做没有道理。但既然老人们这么说，我一个年轻人也无可奈何。

“他们说我得赶快结婚生子，这样我的孩子就会比乌恩卡的子女先长大，先养成气力。结婚并非难事，因为我是酋长。我的父辈功绩卓著并且为族里的人定下了规矩，所以我是受到敬重的。再说，我有很多财富，无论哪个女孩都愿意嫁给我，只是没有一个合我的意。老人们和一些女孩的母亲都催我赶快结婚，因为那时已有好几个猎手对乌恩卡的母亲许下了很高的彩礼，向乌恩卡求婚呢。万一乌恩卡的孩子先长大，我的孩子肯定会死于非命。

“就这样，我一直没有找到合意的女孩，直到某天的黄昏时分，我捕鱼归来，太阳西沉，夕阳满目，微风习习，几只皮舟疾驰在白浪之间。突然，乌恩卡的皮舟从我身旁掠过。她看了我一眼。但见她乌云一般的黑发随风飘扬，湿漉漉的脸蛋沾着水珠子。我刚才说过，我当时只看到一片落日的余晖，再加上自己又是个血气方刚的青年，难免会看花眼。但不管怎么说吧，我当时觉得这是命中注定的缘分。她催舟向前，划了几桨之后又回头看了看——只有乌恩卡那样的女子才会有如此迷人的回眸。我又一次感觉到这就是缘分。我俩你追我赶，从那些慢悠悠的大皮船旁边飞驰而过，人们纷纷为我们喝彩。后来，我们把那些船远远甩在了后边。她飞快地划着皮舟，虽然我的心像一片满帆，却没能追上她。风力加大，白浪翻涌，我们的船像海豹一样在波涛上飞驰，沿着夕阳铺就的金色航道一直向前。”

讲述到此处，纳斯弯下腰，屁股半离开凳子，摆出划桨的姿势，仿佛又回到了当年赛皮舟的那一刻，透过炉火，他仿佛又看见那飞驰的皮舟和乌恩卡那随风飘扬的黑发。呼呼的海风犹在耳畔，鼻孔里腥咸的海水味弥漫开来。

“可她一到岸就跑上沙滩，咯咯笑着，回了她母亲的房屋。那天晚上，我产生了一个惊人的想法，一个无愧于阿卡坦酋长之位的想法。于是，月亮升起时，我去了她母亲的房屋，见门外堆放着雅什·努什的彩礼。雅什·努什是个身强力壮的猎手，一心想跟乌恩卡结婚生子。曾经也有别的小伙子把自己的彩礼搬来堆放在那儿，后来都知趣地撤走了。那些小伙子拿来的彩礼一个比一个多，后者必定超过前者。

“当时我冲着满天的星月大笑几声，然后回到我自己储存财产的屋子里搬东西，一连搬了许多趟，直至我的彩礼比雅什·努什的那堆高出一扎(16)才住手。我的彩礼包括：晒干后烟熏过的鱼；四十张海豹皮和二十张兽皮，而且每张皮都扎了口，里面装满了鱼油；另外还有十张熊皮，那是春天它们出来觅食时我在森林里猎到的。我的彩礼中还有珠子项链、毯子和红布，是我跟东方客用东西交换来的，而那些东方客则是和更东边的人做贸易换来的。我看了看雅什·努什的那堆彩礼，不由得大笑起来。我身为阿卡坦的酋长，财富比部落里任何一个年轻人都要雄厚。再说，我的父辈曾经立下了丰功伟绩，并为部落制定规矩，其大名被族人口口相传。

“就这样，第二天早晨我到海滩上，用眼角的余光偷偷向乌恩卡母亲的房屋那儿瞥了一眼，发现我的彩礼原封未动放在那儿。女人们面带微笑地窃窃私语着。我感到纳闷，觉得自己的彩礼应该是多得史无前例的呀。当天夜里，我又加了一些进去，还在彩礼堆的旁边放了一条从未下过海的、用硝得非常好的毛皮制作的皮舟。然而，那些东西次日仍堆放在那里，成了人们的笑料。乌恩卡的母亲是个狡诈的女人，而在族人面前丢人现眼，备受侮辱，最终使我恼羞成怒。夜里，我又拿了一些东西过去，使那堆彩礼变成了小山。这还不算，我还把我的大皮船也拖了去，那只船论价值抵得上二十条皮舟。次日清晨，那堆彩礼不见了踪影。

“接下来，我就开始准备结婚了。为了宴会上的美食和发放的礼品，连住在东边的居民也来了。乌恩卡比我大四个太阳（按我们的算法，一个‘太阳’就是一年）。比较起来，我只是个小弟弟。但我是酋长，又是酋长的儿子，所以年龄不成问题。

“但就在这时，一艘双桅帆船在海面上露出帆来——随着一阵阵风刮来，那船帆越来越近、越来越大。船上忙作一团，人们在用抽水机把船舱里的水朝外抽，但见一股股清水从排水口流出来。船头站着一个身材魁梧的男人，一边查看着水深，一边发号施令，声若滚雷。他的眼睛呈淡蓝色，似深深的海水，头发像海狮的鬃毛，颜色黄似南方人收割的稻草，又似水手用来编绳子的马尼拉黄麻。

“那几年倒是常见有轮船从远方来，但靠到阿卡坦岸边的却是第一艘。婚宴一时中断，妇女和孩子们躲进了家中，我们这些男人张弓搭箭，拿起长矛准备迎战。不过，等到船头触到了沙滩，那些陌生人却只顾忙着他们自己的事，并不理会我们。待海潮一退，他们就将轮船放倒，着手修补船底的一个大窟窿。女人们又悄悄回到宴席上，宴会继续进行。

“涨潮的时候，那些海上浪人把船拖到了深水区，然后来见我们。他们拿着礼物，显得很友好。我请他们入席，就像对待所有来宾一样诚心欢迎他们，赠给他们礼物，因为这毕竟是我结婚的日子，而我又是阿卡坦的酋长。那个头发像海狮鬃毛的男人也在那些人中间，他人高马大、力大无穷，走起路来似乎连地面都发颤。他眼睛望着乌恩卡，死死盯住她不放，两条胳膊抱在胸前，久久不肯离去，一直待到太阳落山、星星出来，才回到了他的船上去。他走后，我牵起乌恩卡的手，把她领到我家里。大伙儿在那里载歌载舞，一片欢声笑语，女人们对我们说着那些遇到这种场合必说的意味深长的话，不过我们却没有往心里去。最后，大家尽欢而散，纷纷告别，只剩下了我们俩。

“欢庆的余音尚未散尽，那个海上浪人的头目走进了我的家门。他带来了几个黑瓶子，于是我们喝着瓶子中的液体，寻欢作乐。要知道，当时我只是个年轻人，又生活在一个与世隔绝的地方。于是，我浑身的血像火一样燃烧起来，一颗心轻飘飘的，宛若海浪的泡沫，轻得能飞到悬崖上去。乌恩卡一声不响地坐在角落里的一堆兽皮上，眼睛睁得大大的，好像有点害怕。那个头发像海狮鬃毛的男子直愣愣地看着她，看了很长时间。后来，他手下的人送来了一捆一捆的东西，堆在我面前。那些东西阿卡坦的人见都没有见过，其中有长短枪支、火药、子弹、亮晃晃的斧头、钢刀和灵巧的工具，还有一些我闻所未闻的稀奇古怪的玩意儿。他做了个手势，表示那些东西都是我的了。我觉得他如此慷慨，真是个了不起的人。可谁知他又做了个手势，表示要把乌恩卡领走，带到他的船上去。你们听明白了吗？他要把乌恩卡领走，带到他的船上去。祖辈的那腔英雄热血顿时涌遍了我的全身，我操起长矛，准备把他戳个透心凉。可是，酒瓶里的那些东西偷走了我的力气，他揪住我的脖领，把我的头往墙上猛撞。我只觉得自己软绵绵的，像个刚出生的婴儿，两腿撑不住身子。乌恩卡被拖向门口时，尖声大叫，用手乱抓房里的东西，结果弄得那些东西散落了一地。后来，那个头目伸出粗壮的胳膊将她抱起，她就用手扯他的黄头发，惹得他哈哈大笑，那笑声就像是一只巨大的雄海豹发情时的叫声。

“我爬上滩头，呼喊族人出来营救，可是他们吓得不敢出来。只有雅什·努什是个男子汉，挺身而出，却被那些人用船桨打在头上，打得他趴在沙滩上，动也动不了了。后来，那些家伙唱着得胜歌升起船帆，乘风而去。

“人们说这样也好，因为从今往后再也没有族人之间的流血仇杀了。而我一句话也没说，耐心等到月圆之时，在皮舟上装了一些干鱼和鱼油当干粮，只身去了东方。途中，我见到了很多岛屿和很多人。一直偏居一隅的我此时才发现世界竟是那么大。我比手势和人们交谈，但他们说没见过那艘船以及那个头发像海狮鬃毛的人。他们让我再朝东找找看。那一路，我夜宿古怪的地方，吃稀奇的食物，接触陌生的面孔。很多人都笑我，觉得我脑子不正常。有时遇见一些老年人，他们就叫我面朝阳光，衷心为我祝福；年轻女子听我讲述那艘怪异的船和那些海上浪人带走了乌恩卡时，眼圈都会湿润起来。

“就这样，我穿越波涛汹涌的大海，挺过了狂风暴雨，抵达了乌纳拉斯卡。那儿倒是有两艘双桅帆船，不过都不是我要找的那艘。于是，我就继续往东走，越发觉得世界广阔。我到了乌纳莫克岛、科迪亚克岛以及阿托格纳克岛，但在那些地方也都没有打听到那艘船的下落。一天，我到了一个到处是岩石的地方，看见一些人在山上挖大洞。岸边停放着一艘双桅帆船，但不是我要找的那艘。那些人正把挖出来的石头装上船。我觉得他们荒唐可笑，因为世界上到处都有石头，没必要来这儿挖。他们给我食物吃，叫我为他们干活。等到船吃水深了，船长给了我些工钱打发我走。我问他要到哪儿去，他用手指了指南面。我做了个手势示意想跟他走，起初他只是付之一笑，后来觉得船上缺人，也就让我上船当了帮手。在船上，我学着说他们的话，帮他们拉锚索，突遇狂风时则帮着收帆，还和他们一道轮班掌舵。不过这也不足为奇，因为我的祖先和这些航海人本来就属于同一血统。

“我当时心想，要找那个头发像海狮鬃毛的人并不难，只要跟他的白人族群打成一片就不难发现他的下落。一天，我们望到了陆地，便驾船穿过海峡，到了一个港口。我原以为那儿停泊的船也只不过有我的手指头那么多，谁知码头上的船竟连绵数英里，密密麻麻如鱼群般排列在一起。我上船打听那个头发像海狮鬃毛的人，人们都只是打个哈哈，回答时操着各方语言。我发现他们来自四面八方、天涯海角。

“后来我走进了那座城市，逢人便看他们的脸。可是那里的人太多了，多得就像岸边密密匝匝的鳕鱼，数也数不清。城市的喧嚣声吵得我简直受不了，眼前的车水马龙看得我头晕眼花。我继续前行，走啊走，穿过歌声荡漾、阳光和煦的大地，走过庄稼丰饶的平原，步入一座座大城市，发现城里到处是过着女人那种生活的男人，到处是满口假话，因贪图黄金而发黑的心肠。而在阿卡坦，我的族人还在狩猎和捕鱼，他们并不知道世界之大，过得心满意足。

“始终让我忘不了的是乌恩卡捕鱼归来时看我的那种目光。我坚信，到了某个时候我一定会找到她。在家乡，当她在朦胧的暮色里行走在寂静的小径上，当她引得我追逐她，穿过沾满晨露的田野时，她的眼神是那样迷人——只有乌恩卡才会有那样的眼神。

“我一路流浪，经过了上千个城市。有的人心肠好，给我东西吃，有的则取笑我，还有的出口骂我。但我都咬紧牙关默默坚持着，去了许多奇怪的地方，见了许多奇怪的景象。有时候，我，一个酋长，又是酋长之子，还要放下身段为人打工糊口——那些雇主说话粗声粗气，一个个铁石心肠，只知道敛财聚富，全不顾别人的劳苦和忧伤。至于要找的那个人，我却一点消息也没有打听到。后来，我又回到了海边，就像海豹回到了自己的栖息地。那是一个港口，位于北方的一个国家。在那里，我总算打听到了那个黄发海上浪人的一星半点的消息，方才知道他原来是个海豹猎手，知道他正在海上寻找猎物。

“于是，我就跟几个懒惰的西瓦希人(17)一起乘上一只猎海豹的船，朝着北方漫无目的地寻找。当时，正值猎海豹的旺季。我们累死累活，找了好几个月，见了许多船只，听了许多有关他胡作非为的传闻，但始终未在海上看到他的影踪。我们一路向北，甚至到了普里比洛夫群岛(18)，在那儿的沙滩上猎杀了成群的海豹，然后把它们仍温热的尸体搬上船，海豹身体流出的血和油从排水口直朝外淌，弄得甲板上都无法站人了。一艘速度很慢的蒸汽船追了过来，用大炮向我们开火。而我们扯起满帆破浪而去，隐身于茫茫大雾中。海浪冲上甲板，把甲板上的血污冲洗了个干净。

“如我所说，就在我们被吓得魂飞魄散、狼狈逃窜之时，那个黄头发的海上浪人登上了普里比洛夫群岛。他到了那儿的加工厂，叫他的几个喽啰扣住厂里的工人，并命令其余的人从仓库里搬出一万张生皮装上他的船。这虽然只是传闻，但我相信是真的。我沿岸航行，虽没有遇见过他，但北边的海上却广有他的传闻，说他无法无天、胆大妄为，那儿有三个国家都派船在搜捕他。我还听到了一些关于乌恩卡的传闻，船老大们说起她都赞不绝口。她一直跟着那家伙，据说已经习惯了他的生活方式，日子过得很快活。但我却不以为然，深知她一定惦念着自己的同胞，向往着阿卡坦那黄色的沙滩。

“后来，我掉头返回，经过很长时间的航行，又回到了海峡旁的那个港口。到了那里，我听说他已经横渡大洋，前往温暖的东部，到俄罗斯海域以南去捕猎海豹了。此时，我已经成了一个真正的水手，跟他那一族的人同船航行，沿着他的踪迹前去捕猎海豹。在那片新的水域，船只很少，而我们整整一个春天都跟在海豹群后边紧追不舍，将它们赶向北方。途中，母海豹纷纷怀孕，拖着笨重的身子游入了俄罗斯海域，船员们怨声载道，心生畏惧。那一片浓雾重重，每天去捕杀海豹的船只上都有人员失踪。船员们拒绝再出去作业，船长只好命令原路返回。而我心里有数，知道那个黄发海上浪人绝不会知难而退，一定会紧追海豹群，哪怕一直追到少有人敢涉足的俄罗斯群岛。于是，趁着夜里天黑，当瞭望哨在船头甲板上打盹的时候，我偷走一条小船，独自一人朝着那个温暖而狭长的海岸划去。我一直向南划，在江户湾(19)遇到了一些水手，他们狂放不羁、无所畏惧。吉原(20)的姑娘小巧玲珑、肤如凝脂，个个都很漂亮。可是我不能停留，因为我知道乌恩卡正漂泊于北方海豹栖息地那波涛汹涌的海上。

“在江户湾遇到的那些人来自世界各地，不信鬼神，以四海为家，船上挂着日本国的旗帜。我随着他们一起去富饶的铜岛海岸捕杀海豹，盐舱里的海豹皮堆得像小山一样。那片水域静悄悄的，临离开时也没见着一个人影。后来，有一天，一阵狂风吹散了大雾，一艘双桅帆船急急地向我们驶来，它后面有一艘烟囱里冒着浓烟的俄国战舰紧追不舍。我们借助风势飞速逃离，双桅帆船跟在我们屁股后面，离我们越来越近——我们每前进两英尺，它就能追过来三英尺。双桅帆船的船尾站着一个人，正是那个头发像海狮鬃毛的家伙。他手扶操纵杆，操纵着风帆，哈哈哈地放声大笑。乌恩卡在他的身旁——我一眼就认出了她。俄国战舰的炮弹掠过海面飞来时，那家伙把乌恩卡送进了船舱。正如我刚才所言，他们的船速比我们的快，随着海水的起伏，我们看见了双桅帆船那绿颜色的舵。我背对俄国人的炮火，冲向舵盘驾船疾行，心里咒骂着那个头发像海狮鬃毛的家伙。我们都清楚他在打什么鬼主意——他想把我们甩到后面，让我们成为挡箭牌，而他则可以逃之夭夭。我们的桅杆被炮弹击中，使得我们的船像受伤的海鸥一样在风中挣扎；他却带着乌恩卡溜之大吉，消失在了海天交接之处。

“我们有什么办法呢？新剥下的海豹皮本身就很能说明问题了。于是，我们被押送到一个俄国港口，后来又到了一个荒凉的地方，被逼着在矿山挖盐。有些人累死了，有的活了下来。”

纳斯说着，一把掀开肩膀上的毯子，露出疙疙瘩瘩的肉，那分明是鞭子抽打后留下的一道道伤痕。普林斯连忙替他盖好，因为那样子实在惨不忍睹。

“我们在那儿熬了很久，有时也有人逃向南方，但每一次都会被抓回来。因此，等到我们这些从江户湾来的人一天夜里暴动，夺下警卫队的枪逃跑时，我们就向北逃去。北方的土地非常辽阔，有潮湿的平原，还有茫茫的大森林。正值寒冷的季节，地上雪积得很厚，我们没有一个人认得路。在无边无际的森林里，我们一连跋涉了几个月，累得要死。当时是怎么熬过来的，我都记不清了，只记得那时没有东西吃，常常躺着等死。最后，我们总算走到了海边，那儿是一片冰天雪地。此时，我们一行只剩下了三个人，其中一个就是江户来的船长。这位船长熟悉那片辽阔土地的情况，知道何处海面上结冰，可以从冰上走到对岸。于是他就领着我们向那儿走，不知走了有多久，反正路途非常遥远，远到最后只剩下我们俩了。到了那个地方，我们遇到了五个陌生人，他们是当地的土著人，身边有许多雪橇狗，雪橇上还有很多兽皮。但我们却穷得一无所有，于是就想打劫他们。在雪地里经过一场混战，那几个陌生人和船长都死了，狗和兽皮都归了我。接下来，我就踏上了布满裂缝的冰面，站在一块浮冰上漂游，后来从西边起了一阵狂风，才把我刮到了岸边。上岸之后，我去了戈洛文湾和帕斯蒂里克，后来遇到了那个神父。再接下来，我一路向南走，回到了我最初去过的那片阳光普照的温暖地带。

“不过，那儿的海产并不丰富，出海捕猎海豹利润小，风险大。捕猎的船队散了摊，我向船长和船员们打听乌恩卡他们的下落，却无人知晓。于是，我离开奔涌不息的大海去了内陆，所到之处，见到的全是静止不动的树木、房屋和大山。我走了很远的路，学到了很多的东西，甚至学会了读书写字。我觉得这是必需的，因为我心想乌恩卡一定也掌握了这些本事，一旦我们重逢……一旦我们重逢……

“我就是这样流浪四方，犹如一只没有舵盘的帆船，随着风向漂泊。不过，我始终在睁大眼睛看，竖起耳朵听，遇到游历广的人便打听，因为我知道，他们要是见过我找的那两个人，一定会记得的。后来，我碰到一个刚从山里出来的人，他有几块矿石，那里面嵌着许多跟豆子一样大的金粒。此人不仅仅听说过他们，还见过他们，并且很了解他们。他说那俩人发了财，就住在他们挖掘金子的那个地方。

“那地方很荒凉，非常遥远。我找到他们的大本营时，发现那儿隐于大山深处，工人在洞里挖金子日夜不息，终年不见阳光。不过我去得不凑巧，听人说他们不在本地，而是去了英国。据说，他们去招商引资，准备成立公司。我去看了看他们住的房子，觉得他们的房子就像人们在远古国度所会见到的那种宫殿。夜里，我从一扇窗户偷偷爬了进去，想瞧瞧他让乌恩卡过的是什么样的日子。我挨个房间查看，觉得他们的生活十分优越，不次于王公贵族。工人们说他对待乌恩卡就像对待王后一样。许多人都感到奇怪，不知她究竟属于哪个民族，因为她带着外来的血统，跟阿卡坦的女人不一样。至于她的身世，无人知晓。话又说回来，就算她贵如王后，我可是酋长呢，还是酋长之子，我送给她的兽皮、皮船和珍珠可是价值连城呢。

“不过，话也不多说了。我毕竟是个水手，精通海上航行那一套，于是我便跟踪到了英国，后来又跟到了别的几个国家。有时，我从人们的口中了解到他们的下落，有时则从报上看到他们的消息，却一次也没有见过他们的面。他们有的是钱，路上走得快，而我一贫如洗，当然追不上。后来，他们遇到麻烦，财富荡然一空，就像一缕轻烟随风飘走了。当时，报纸连篇累牍报道此事。事情过后，却再无人提起。我心里清楚：他们一定又回去干老行当，又去采矿挖金了。

“他们成了穷光蛋，从世人的眼里消失了。我寻找他们，从一个营地寻到另一个营地，甚至一直向北到了库特尼地区。在那个地区，我获得了一条已经过时的线索。他们来过，但已经走了，有人说走的是这个方向，有的说是那个，还有人说他们去了育空河一带。我这里找找，那里找找，辗转各地，最后弄得我都厌倦了，觉得这个世界简直太大了。一次，我和一个西北的土著人走在库特尼地区，路途艰难遥远。他饿得走不动了，觉得还不如死了好。他曾经去过育空地区，翻山越岭，走的是一条没人走过的小路。此时，他知道自己死期已至，便把身上的一张地图给了我，并告诉了我一个秘密的地方，对天发誓那儿有许多黄金。

“当时，寻金的人潮滚滚涌向北方。我身无分文，只好受雇于人，为别人驭狗。其余的情况你都知道了。在道森，我遇见了他们俩。乌恩卡没有认出我，因为她走时我还只是个年轻人，后来她的生活又是那么丰富多彩，已无暇忆及这个曾为她付了高昂彩礼的人。

“记得吗？你出钱帮我摆脱了那趟苦役的束缚。我掉头回去准备以我的方式解决过去的一切——这一时刻我等待已久，如今找到了他们，万不可因操之过急而误事。正如我刚才所言，一定要以我的方式解决问题。回想起自己的这一段人生经历，回想起途中目睹的灾难和亲身经受的折磨，回想起在俄国海边那茫茫无际的森林里受冻挨饿的情景，我气愤难平。后来的情况你也知道——我领着他和乌恩卡去东方寻宝，那儿去的人多，回来的却少。我领着他们去了一个地方，那儿满是累累白骨和人们的诅咒，还有那谁也无法带得走的黄金。

“那一趟，道路漫长，雪深难行。我们的狗很多，它们吃得也多，而我们的雪橇不可能将开春之前所需的东西都带上——我们必须在河流化冻之前赶回来。于是我们把干粮贮藏在沿途的各个地方，一是为了减轻雪橇的负担，二是为了让我们返回时不至于饿肚子。到了麦克奎森，那儿的营地里有三个人，我们就在营地跟前挖了个粮窖，到梅奥后又挖了一个——梅奥有一个狩猎人营地，住着十来个佩利人(21)，他们是从南边越过边界来打猎的。之后，我们一路向东，再也看不见人迹了，能看见的只有沉睡的河流、静寂的森林和无声无息的北国雪野。我刚才说过，那一趟道路漫长、雪深难行。有时候，苦苦走一天也走不了八英里或十英里的路，夜里累得倒头便睡，像死猪一样。他们做梦也没有想到我是纳斯——阿卡坦的酋长，一个一心要报仇雪恨的人。

“这时候，我们挖的贮藏干粮的粮窖比以前的要小。夜里，我沿着走过的路悄悄回去把干粮换个地方贮藏，看上去会让人以为干粮被狼獾偷吃了。此事干得神不知鬼不觉。有些地方十分危险，不小心就会掉入河中，那儿水流湍急，河面上结着浮冰，底下却暗流涌动。就是在这样一个地方，我赶的雪橇和狗一起栽了下去。他和乌恩卡自认倒霉，但什么也没说。栽下去的那辆雪橇上装着很多干粮，拉雪橇的狗也是最强壮的。可他只是满不在乎地哈哈一笑，因为他是一个不畏艰险的强者。干粮少了，他就给狗喂得很少，后来索性把狗一条条解下套，宰杀后再喂给它们的同伴吃。他说回家时这样反倒好，落个一身轻，沿途从粮窖取干粮吃，用不着狗和雪橇了。当时要说用不着狗和雪橇倒是真的，因为我们的干粮已少得可怜。待我们走到了那个满是累累白骨和诅咒的黄金地时，当天夜里最后一条狗也死在了挽具里。

“那张地图标的位置很正确，我们到达了那个地方，那儿地处群山的中心，必须在一座冰封的分水岭峭壁上凿出阶梯攀上山巅。站在山顶四下望去，但见皑皑白雪填平了所有的沟壑，平展得就像一派丰收景象的辽阔的平原。周围群山巍峨，冰雪覆盖的山头直插云天，与星辰做伴。在那一片古怪的雪原当中，有一处地方按说是座山谷，却见那儿白雪皑皑，覆着雪的地面猛地向下沉去，像是要沉到地球的心脏部位。我们要是没有做过水手的话，看到这种光景，一定会头晕目眩的。当时，我们站在令人发晕的峭壁边缘，想找一条下去的路。脚下的峭壁有一面（也只有这一面）是倾斜的，倾斜得就跟飓风袭来时的甲板一样。不知道那是怎么形成的，但情况的确如此。只听他说：‘这是地狱之门。走吧，咱们下去吧。’于是，我们就走下去了。

“在斜坡底部有一座小木屋，为前人所建，用的是从崖顶抛下来的木头，年代已非常久远。不同时期都有人丧命于此，成了孤魂野鬼。屋里有一些桦树皮，上面刻着他们的遗言以及诅咒。我们看后得知：一个死于坏血病；一个是由于合伙人偷走了他仅有的一点干粮和弹药悄悄溜走，导致他最后被饿死了；一个是因为遭到一只脸上有白斑的灰熊攻击，伤重而亡；一个是因为没有打到猎物，活活饿死的……还有一些其他情况，反正都是因为贪恋黄金，最后死在了黄金的旁边，只不过各有各的死法罢了。他们辛苦得来的黄金成了无用之物，黄澄澄散落一地，令人觉得如在梦中。

“不过，我远途领来的这家伙却不糊涂，大脑很清楚。只听他说：‘咱们干粮已尽，现在要做的只是看一眼这黄金，弄清它是从哪儿得来的，究竟有多少，然后赶快离开，免得让黄金迷住心窍，乱了咱们的方寸。咱们以后还会回来的，那时多带点干粮，再将黄金全部据为咱们的财产。’接下来，我们查看了黄金矿的矿脉，发现它跟人的脉络一样直透崖壁。我们进行了测量，然后从上到下画出轮廓，打下几根木桩，又在树上刻了字，标示明白此处是我们的财产。那时，我们肚子里空空如也，饿得双腿发抖，肚子也很难受，心也扑通扑通地快要跳出来了。最后，我们爬上那道高耸的崖壁，踏上了归途。

“在最后的一段路上，我们俩一左一右架着乌恩卡走，一不小心就栽跟头，最终总算挣扎到了那个粮窖，可是那儿空空如也。我转移干粮的那件事干得很巧妙，他觉得是狼獾偷走的，于是便破口大骂狼獾，还骂上帝不保佑他。乌恩卡却表现得很勇敢，只是笑了笑，把自己的手放进了他的大手里。我急忙将脸转开，努力克制住情绪。‘咱们不妨生堆火休息休息，明天早晨再说。可以把鹿皮鞋当干粮吃，积攒些气力。’乌恩卡这样说道。说干就干，我们把鹿皮鞋的统子切成一条一条的，煮了半夜，煮软了才能嚼碎下咽。第二天早晨，我们商量了一下我们的处境。走到下一个粮窖得走五天的路，那是我们力所不及的，当务之急是打点猎物果腹。

“‘走，咱们打猎去。’他说。

“‘好的，’我说，‘咱们打猎去。’

“他吩咐乌恩卡留在火堆旁保存体力，而我们俩出发打猎去了。趁着他去寻找鹿迹的当儿，我摸到了我偷换的那个贮藏干粮的地方。我只吃了一点干粮，免得叫他们见我长了气力而看出破绽。晚上在回营地的路上，他饿得老摔跟头。我也装出十分衰弱的样子，踉踉跄跄的，常被雪鞋绊倒，每走一步仿佛都要栽倒，再也爬不起来似的。后来我们把鹿皮鞋吃了，添了点力气。

“他真是个了不起的人，有一股精神始终支撑着他，至死不渝，除非为了乌恩卡，否则有泪决不轻弹。第二天，我跟着他去打猎，为的是看看他最后的结局。他走几步就要躺倒休息一下，到了晚上已气息奄奄。然而次日早晨他有气无力地骂了声娘，又咬紧牙继续前行了。他走路东倒西歪像个醉汉，有好几次我都以为他要完蛋了，可他是一个极为坚强的人，有着打不垮的铁人精神，硬是硬撑着挺过了整整一天。他打到了两只松鸡，却舍不得吃。按说，松鸡不必用火烤，是可以生吃的，吃了就能活命，可他心里只想着乌恩卡，只顾挣扎着向宿营地赶。后来，他实在走不动了，只能手脚并用地在雪地上爬。我走到他跟前，从他的眼里看出他的生命即将结束。即便到了这个时候也不算太晚，只要吃了松鸡就可以挽救他的性命。可他不肯吃，而是丢掉猎枪，像狗一样用嘴叼着松鸡爬行。我走在他身旁，腰杆挺得直直的。他停下来休息时会不解地看我一眼，不明白我怎么会这样结实。此时，我看得出他已说不出话来了，只见他嘴唇张合，却听不到声音从嘴里出来。说实在的，他真是一个了不起的人，我的心都有些软了。然而，我想到了自己在俄国海边那茫茫无际的森林里受冻挨饿的情景，想起了乌恩卡本是我的妻子，我为她付出了兽皮、皮船和珍珠这般高昂的彩礼。

“我们就这样穿过了白雪皑皑的森林，犹如湿漉漉的海雾般的寂静沉甸甸地压在我们身上。过去的生活犹如幻影悬浮在眼前，在周围晃动。我仿佛看见了阿卡坦那黄色的海滩，看见了捕鱼归来的飞驰的皮舟，看见了坐落于森林边的一栋栋房屋，还仿佛看见了那两个自封为酋长的人——一个是我的祖先，另一个是我妻子乌恩卡的祖先，正是他们给族人立下了种种规矩。此外，我仿佛还看到了雅什·努什走在我的身旁，头发里粘着湿湿的沙粒，他被打倒时折断了的长矛仍握在手中。我知道，那个时刻来临了，我看见了乌恩卡期许的眼神。

“正如我所言，我们就那样穿过了茫茫林海，直至嗅到了宿营地的烟火味。我弯下腰，将松鸡从他的嘴里夺了下来。他侧身躺着喘气，眼睛里涌出诧异的神色，慢慢伸手去摸索挂在身上的腰刀。我拿走了他的刀，冲着他的脸大笑。即便这个时候，他仍一副大惑不解的样子。于是，我摆出拿黑瓶子喝酒的架势，做了个手势，就好像雪地上堆了好多货物似的，把我新婚之夜出现的情景表演了一番。我一句话也没说，但他明白了。不过他并不害怕。只见他嘴角露出一丝冷笑，一副怒不可遏的样子，并因此而产生了一股新的力量。宿营地就在不远处，但雪深难行，他爬得像蜗牛一样慢。一次，他躺着久久动不了身。我把他翻过来，死死盯住他的眼睛。他的眼里忽而有了活力，忽而死气沉沉。我松手放开他时，他又艰难地向前爬行。就这样，我们来到了篝火旁。乌恩卡见了，立刻冲到了他身旁。他嘴唇动了动，却没有说出话来，后来就用手指着我，想让乌恩卡明白是我在捣鬼。随后，他就静静地躺在雪地里，一动也不动，躺了很久很久。直到现在，他仍旧躺在那儿。

“我一直没有吭声，只是在那儿烤着松鸡。松鸡烤好之后，我才说了话，用的是她许多年都没有听到过的家乡的语言。她直起了腰，惊讶得瞪大了眼睛，问我是什么人，这种话是从何处学来的。

“‘我是纳斯。’我说道。

“‘什么？真的吗？’她凑过来要看个仔细。

“‘是真的，’我回答说，‘我是纳斯，阿卡坦的酋长，是我们家族的最后一个传人，而你是你们家族的最后一个传人。’

“她听了哈哈大笑起来。我宁愿再目睹许多灾难，再经历许多艰险，也不愿听到那样的笑声，它让我心里发寒。就这样，我坐在皑皑白雪里，周围寂静无声，孤零零地陪伴着一个死人和一个疯笑的女子。

“‘来吧！’我觉得她神经有些错乱，于是便劝道，‘你吃点东西，咱们离开这里。回阿卡坦的路远着呢。’

“她没理会我，而是把脸埋在他的黄头发里，大笑不止，直笑得天都好像快要塌下来似的。我原以为她认出我后会喜出望外，会立刻想起过去的岁月，谁知却是这般情景，让我感到很是奇怪。

“‘来吧！’我用力抓住她的手大声说道，‘路远难行，还是早点动身的好！’

“‘到哪儿去？’她止住了怪笑，坐起来问我。

“‘回阿卡坦呀。’我回答道。我想着回家乡会叫她的脸色转晴，谁知她跟他一样，嘴角露出一丝冷笑，一副怒不可遏的样子。

“‘好呀，’她说道，‘那咱俩就手拉着手回阿卡坦去，一起住进土坯房，一起吃鱼肉和鱼油度日，再生个孩子，视其为掌上明珠。咱们忘掉一切烦忧，快快活活、幸幸福福。好呀，简直好极啦。走吧，赶快走吧，咱们一起回家乡，回阿卡坦去！’

“她边说边用手指梳着他的黄头发，一边还阴阳怪气地笑着，眼神里却万念俱灰。

“我默默无语地坐着，真不明白这个女人为何如此古怪。记得那天夜里他把她从我身边拖走时，她又是尖声叫喊又是扯他的头发。而现在，她却在抚弄他的头发，不愿离开。回想起自己付出的代价和多年来的苦苦等待，我一把拽住她要将她拖走，一如他多年前那般。而她也跟那天夜里一样死活不肯走，拼命地挣扎，就像母鸡不愿离开小鸡。我拽着她，把她从火堆和那个黄发男人身边拖开，然后松了手。她坐在那里听我说话。我袒露心扉，倒出了心里的苦水，讲了我漂泊异国他乡的苦难经历，讲了我多年的旅途奔波和忍饥挨饿的生活，讲了自始至终伴随着我的希望。我把一切都和盘托出，甚至还讲了我和黄发男人之间白天发生的事情，以及我小时候的生活经历。我说着说着，见她的眼里出现了柔情，那柔情好像黎明时的一片阳光。在那里，我看到了怜悯，看到了一个女人的温柔和爱情，看到了乌恩卡的芳心和灵魂。我觉得自己又成了那个年轻人，而乌恩卡的眼里又露出了当年她跑上沙滩，咯咯笑着奔向母亲房屋时出现过的眼神。那种冷酷、令人不安的感觉倏然消失，我忘掉了饥饿和疲倦，觉得团聚的时刻就在眼前。我感到她的胸脯在召唤我，召唤我把脸埋在上面，将一切都忘掉。她向我张开了双臂，我扑进了她怀里。突然，她眼里升腾起仇恨的怒火，伸手拔出我腰间的刀，连刺我两刀。

“‘你是条狗！猪猡！’她冷笑一声，把我推倒在雪地上。随即，她狂笑一阵，笑声击碎了周围的沉寂。最后，她又回到了死去的黄发男人身旁。

“如我所说，她刺了我两刀，但由于饥饿乏力，刺得不狠，我命不该绝。不过，当时我决定留下来，和他们长眠在一起——我跟这两人的生活密不可分，为了他们我千里迢迢来到了此处。可是，有一笔债压在我的身上，使得我不能就此安息。

“返回的路很漫长，途中寒风刺骨，没有吃的东西可以果腹。那几个佩利人没有猎到麋鹿，把我贮藏的干粮吃光了。麦克奎森的那三个白人也是如此，偷吃了我们的干粮，待我找回来时，见他们饿得只剩下了骨头架，死在了木屋里。离开那儿之后，我饿得什么都记不得了。来到了这里，我才见到了食物和火——啊，多么暖和的火呀！”

他讲述完之后，把身子凑到炉子跟前烤火，甚至显得有些羡慕我们的生活。在油灯的投射下，他悲惨的身影久久地映在墙上。

“乌恩卡后来怎么样了呢？”普林斯对于刚才听到的故事仍然难以忘怀，不由高声问道。

“乌恩卡吗？她不肯吃松鸡，只是搂着他的脖子躺在那儿，把脸深深地埋在他的黄发里。我把火挪得近一点，让她不至于受冻，而她却躲到了一边。我跟过去，又在那儿生了一堆火。可这样做一点也不顶用，因为她一口东西也不肯吃。直到现在，他们还依偎着躺在雪地里呢。”

“你有什么打算吗？”马拉摩特·基德问道。

“不知道。阿卡坦是个弹丸之地，反正我是不愿再回去了，不愿再生活在那个世界的角落里了。不过，说来说去，活着对我而言也没有太大的意义了。我倒想去找康士坦丁警官，让他给我戴上手铐，末了上绞架完事。那样，我就可以安眠了。唉，说不清呀，真不知以后该怎样才好。”

“基德，你听我说，”普林斯在一旁插话说，“这可是谋杀呀！”

“胡说！”马拉摩特·基德喝止了他，“有些事情是超出咱们的智慧和衡量标准的。孰是孰非难以说得清，咱们可不能妄加评判。”

纳斯朝着炉子又贴近了一些。屋子里静悄悄的，掉根针在地上都能够听得见。每个人的眼前都仿佛出现了无数幻象，一幕幕场景忽隐忽现。

热爱生命


胜算不会太多——

生活是一场赌博：

既然已经下注，

输光老本也要搏一搏。

他们两个一瘸一拐，步履艰难地走下河岸。有一次前边的那个还在乱石间被绊了一下，差点摔倒。二人疲惫不堪，浑身发软，从脸上的表情看来他们经历了漫长的艰辛跋涉。他们的肩上负着沉甸甸的用毛毯包起来的行李卷，用额上的一条皮带勒着，如此有助于减轻肩上的负荷重量。他们各拿着一支步枪，弓着腰走路，肩膀前倾，头始终朝前看，眼睛盯着地面。

“我真希望我们身上能有几发子弹，可惜它们全都躺在地窖里。”走在后面的男人说。

他说话的声音单调、死板，不带有任何感情成分在里边。走在前面的同伴未作理会，只顾深一脚浅一脚地前行，涉入乳白色的河水里(1)，那河水在岩石间流淌，泛着泡沫。

后面的那个紧跟着他。他们下水前连鞋袜都没有脱，尽管河水冰冷刺骨——冷得他们脚腕生疼、腿脚麻木。有些地方河水没膝，冲得他们站都站不稳。

跟在后面的那个踩在一块光滑的石头上，差点滑倒，幸亏他猛地一用劲才稳住了脚，同时疼得尖叫了一声。他感到头晕目眩，一边摇晃着身子，一边将空着的那只手伸出去，像是要在空气中寻找支撑物。站稳后，他举步前行，但身子又一摇晃，差点摔倒。他只好站着不动，把目光投向了前边那个自始至终都未曾回头的人。

他纹丝不动，站了足足一分钟，犹豫了一会儿，最后才高声叫道：

“喂，比尔，我的脚腕扭伤啦。”

比尔踉跄着脚步，在乳白色的河水里走着，依然没有回头。这个男人望着他的背影，虽然脸上依旧没有表情，眼睛里却流露出受伤小鹿般无助的神情。

另一个男人一瘸一拐地登上对面的河岸，头也不回地径直向前行进。河里的人眼睁睁地瞧着，嘴唇有点发抖，嘴边乱蓬蓬的棕色胡子也很明显地跟着抖动，他不由自主地伸出舌头来将嘴唇舔了舔。

“比尔！”他大声叫喊着。

这是一个坚强的男人身处困境时发出的求救声，可是比尔还是没有回头。他目送着比尔离去，看着他怪模怪样地摇晃着身子，跌跌撞撞、步履蹒跚地爬上河对岸的缓坡，向着低矮山丘上那朦胧的天际线走去。他望着比尔的背影，直至比尔翻过山头，彻底消失。然后，他收回了目光，缓慢地环顾了一下四周，比尔走了，现在只剩下他孤零零一个人了。

太阳快接近地平线了，像一团快要熄灭的火球，隐没在无形无体的浓雾和水汽中，显得朦朦胧胧，让人觉得宛若一种轮廓模糊、虚无缥缈的物体。他掏出怀表看了看，单腿立着休息了一会儿。现在是四点钟。在这个七月末或八月初的时节——近一两个星期来，他都辨不清具体日子——他知道太阳落山处大约是在西北方。他望望南面，知道在那些荒凉的小山后面就是大熊湖；他还知道在那个方向，北极圈的禁区界线穿过加拿大的无人区。他所站的地方是科珀曼河的一条支流，而科珀曼河的干流则向北流去，汇入加冕湾和北冰洋。他从没有到过那个地方，有一次却在哈德逊湾公司的图表上见到过。

他又环顾一周，扫视了一眼周围的环境，目光所及之处并不叫人感到乐观。只见四面都是茫茫无际的地平线，一座座山丘又低又矮，没有树木、灌木丛和青草——什么都没有，只有辽阔、可怕的荒野。顿时，他眼中露出了恐惧的神色。

“比尔！”他不由低声地喊了一两声，“比尔！”

站在乳白色的河水里，他心里感到害怕，觉得周围的旷野在以一种排山倒海的力量向他压来，残忍地要将他压扁，得意扬扬地露出一副狰狞的面容。他吓得浑身发抖，像染了疟疾打摆子一样，抖得连手里的枪都掉进了水里，发出扑通一声响。这声响动才算把他惊醒了。他战胜恐惧，重新振作起精神，在水里摸了摸，把枪找了回来。接着，他将行李卷的重量向左肩移了移，如此可以减轻一部分受伤脚腕的负荷。之后，他慢慢地、小心谨慎地朝着岸边走去，每走一步，脸上的肌肉都疼得要抽搐一下。

他没敢止步，而是不顾疼痛，带着一股孤注一掷的拼劲，发了疯似的冲上河岸，登上山丘（他的同伴就是翻越了这座山丘，消失了踪影），样子古怪、可笑，跟那位一瘸一拐向前冲的同伴相比更是有过之而无不及。可是到了山头，只看见一条死气沉沉、寸草不生的浅谷。恐惧感油然而生，他又一次战胜了恐惧感，把行李卷的重量又向左肩移了移，然后蹒跚地走下山坡。

谷底积满了水，厚厚的苔藓像海绵一样，紧贴在水面上。他每走一步，就积水四溅，每次抬脚，那湿漉漉的苔藓都力图吸住他，发出吧唧吧唧的声音，像是舍不得让他的脚离开似的。他挑着好路走，从一块沼地走到另一块沼地，一路循着比尔的足迹，穿过一座座岩石堆——那些岩石堆矗立在海洋一般的苔藓地里，犹如一个个小岛。

他虽然孤零零的一个人，却没有迷路。他知道，再往前去，就会走到一个小湖跟前，湖边有许多枯死的赤松和冷杉，细瘦、干瘪。当地人把那儿叫作提钦尼奇利，意即“小棍子之地”。有一条小溪汇入湖中——跟刚才涉过的河水不同，溪水不是乳白色的；他清楚地记得小溪的岸边净是灯芯草，连一棵树也没有。他将沿着这条小溪一直走到水源地，走到一道分水岭跟前。然后，他将翻过分水岭，找到另一条小溪的源头，顺着溪水向西走，走到狄斯河（小溪汇入此河）。在狄斯河畔，他将会找到一个地窖，地窖上堆了许多石头，上面放着一个翻过来的独木舟。地窖里有他那支空枪所需要的子弹，还有钓钩、钓线和一张小渔网——打猎和钓鱼用的工具那儿一应俱全。同时，他还会找到面粉（量并不多），此外还有一块腌猪肉和一些豆子。

比尔会在那里等着他的。他们将划着独木舟顺着狄斯河向南顺流而下，直达大熊湖。到了大熊湖，他们将继续向南划，一路向南，到达麦肯齐河，再顺着河流头也不回地向南划，让寒冷的冬天想撵也撵不上他们。就让河水冻成冰块吧，就让天也寒地也冻吧，反正他们会一路向南抵达温暖的哈德逊湾公司的站点，那儿树木高大、茂密，那儿的食物多得吃也吃不完。

他艰难地向前走着，心里翻江倒海想个不停。他不仅拼尽全力跋涉着，脑子也在拼尽全力地思索着，心里认定比尔没有抛弃他，而是在地窖那儿等着他。他必须这样想，否则就没必要拼着性命朝前走了，还不如躺下来死掉好了。太阳像个朦朦胧胧的球，慢慢地向西北方下沉，而他朝着南方一点一点挪着步子（有时一步仅仅是一英寸）——这是他和比尔逃亡的路线，二人想在严冬到来之前逃到南方去。他反复地想着地窖里的食物和哈德逊湾公司那个站点的美餐，想了一遍又一遍。他已经两天没进食了；至于说吃不上自己爱吃的东西，那就更是不止两天了。他多次弯下腰，摘几颗灰白色的沼地浆果，把它们放到口里，嚼一嚼，然后咽下肚。这种沼地浆果其实只是一小粒种子，外面包着一汪水，送进嘴里就化，种子嚼起来又辣又苦。他知道这种浆果并没有养分，但是他仍然抱着希望，耐心地咀嚼着，哪还管什么营养不营养以及味道如何。

九点钟的时候，他被一块岩石的边绊了一下，由于极度疲倦和虚弱，晃了几晃便栽倒了。他侧着身子在地上躺了一会儿，纹丝不动。后来，他从行李卷的背带里挣出身子，笨拙地坐起来。天还没有黑，暮色朦胧，他在乱石中间摸索着干枯的苔藓，然后将干苔藓聚成堆生火，生了一堆不死不活、直冒黑烟的火，再在火上架了一个白铁罐子煮水。

他打开行李卷，做的第一件事就是清点包在里面的火柴。火柴总共有六十七根。不放心，他连着数了三遍，然后将它们分成几份，分别用油纸包起来，一份放在他的空烟草袋里，一份放在破帽子的帽圈里，最后的一份贴胸放在衬衫里。一切安顿完之后，他心里突然感到一阵莫名的恐慌，于是又将火柴从各处取出重新清点——不多不少，还是六十七根。

接下来，他把湿鞋湿袜放在火边烘烤。鹿皮鞋湿透了，都快成了破布；毡袜多处已磨穿，两只脚皮开肉绽，淌血不止。一只脚的脚腕胀得血管直跳，他检查了一下，发现它已经肿得和膝盖一样粗了。行李卷里总共有两条毯子，他拿起其中的一条，从上面撕下一个长条，紧紧缠在脚腕上，然后又撕下几条裹在脚上，以代替鹿皮鞋和袜子。料理停当，他把白铁罐子里滚烫的热水喝了，上好表的发条，钻进两条毯子中间倒头便睡。

这一觉他睡得跟死人一样。半夜时分，黑暗降临，但很快又消失了。太阳从东北方升了起来——最起码来说，那个方向出现了曙光，因为即便有太阳，也被灰色的云团遮得严严实实。

早晨六点钟，他睡醒了，仰面朝天地躺在那儿，呆呆地望着灰蒙蒙的天空，觉得饥肠辘辘。他翻过身侧躺着，胳膊肘压在身下，忽然听见一阵呼哧呼哧的很大的鼻息声，不由吓了一大跳，发现一只公鹿正用警惕、好奇的目光盯着他瞧。那公鹿离他不过五十英尺光景，他脑子里立刻出现了鹿肉排在火上烤得嗞嗞作响、香味扑鼻的情景。他下意识地抓起那支空枪，瞄准，扣动了扳机。公鹿打了个响鼻跑开了，鹿蹄在岩脊上飞奔，发出嗒嗒嗒的声响。

他骂了声娘，把手中的空枪扔到了一旁，然后哼哼唧唧地硬撑着要站起身子。这个过程极其缓慢、极其艰难。他体内的关节像生了锈的铰链，在骨槽里咯吱咯吱地转动着，阻力很大，一屈一伸必须靠着顽强的意志才能做得到。最后，他总算站了起来，但又花了一分钟左右的工夫才直起腰，让他能够像正常人一样站得笔直。

他奋力爬上一个小山包，放眼望去，见不到树木，见不到灌木丛，什么都看不到，只能看得到一望无际的灰色苔藓，零零星星有一些岩石、小湖和小溪点缀其中，但也全都是灰蒙蒙的。天空也是灰色的，那儿没有太阳，连太阳的影子也看不见。他分不清哪个方向才是北方，也不记得昨晚是从哪个方向来到此处的。不过，他没有迷路，对此他深有把握。要不了多久他就能走到“小棍子之地”的。他心里觉得那地方就在左边的某处，路不远，可能再翻过一座小山头就到了。

他又回到睡觉的地方，把东西收拾一下打包成行李卷。至于那三小包火柴，他虽然没有特意清点，但还是检查了一下，以确保它们被放在了行李卷里。对于那个鼓鼓囊囊的鹿皮金袋，他踌躇再三，舍不得丢弃。袋子不大，两只手能攥得过来。金袋重十五磅，差不多跟整个行李卷一样重。丢下还是拿走，这一时叫他犯了愁。最后，他忍痛将金袋扔到一边，继续打包行李。可是，他中途又停下手，看了看那个鹿皮金袋，急忙把它捡了起来，气哼哼地扫了一眼四周，仿佛那片荒原要和他抢夺金袋似的。接下来，他把金袋放入行李卷，站起身，一步一摇晃地开始了一天的行程。

他向左侧走去，一路走走停停，摘一些沼地浆果充饥。扭伤的脚腕变得僵直，比以前瘸得更厉害了。但脚腕之痛跟胃痛比起来就是小巫见大巫了。由于饥饿，胃痛得钻心。一阵又一阵，饥饿像是在用它的牙齿啃着他的胃，使得一心一意朝着“小棍子之地”赶路的他老是分心。沼地浆果并不能减轻这种剧痛，浆果刺激性的味道反而使他的舌头和上颚也跟着痛了起来。

他来到一条山谷跟前，惊起一群石松鸡，它们拍打着翅膀，咯咯咯地叫着，从岩石间和沼地上腾空而起。他用石块去砸，却一只也没有击中。他把行李卷放在地上，像猫捉麻雀一样向落下来的鸟偷偷摸过去。锋利的岩石划破了裤腿，他的膝盖被划伤，流下的鲜血滴了一路。但胃痛盖住了伤口的疼痛。他猫着腰在潮湿的苔藓地上一步一步向前移动着，全然不顾身上的衣服已经湿透、寒冷难耐，对食物的渴望强烈到使他忘掉了一切。石松鸡总是在他快到跟前时腾空而起，盘旋不去，咯咯咯地叫着，像是在嘲笑他。他气得直骂娘，冲着它们大吼大叫。

他继续向前寻找，曾经摸到了一只大概是睡着了的石松鸡跟前。他没有看见那只鸡，直至它从岩缝间的巢里飞起，差点扑到他脸上，这才一惊。他和那只鸡一样慌乱，伸出手胡乱抓了一把，只抓了三根尾羽到手。眼睁睁看着松鸡飞走，他心里恨恨不已，就好像那只松鸡做了什么对不起他的事似的。无奈，他回到原地，背起了行李卷。

时间在一分一秒地慢慢逝去，他走过一片片生态更为活跃的山谷与沼地。一群驯鹿走了过去，大约有二十多只，都在猎枪的射程以内，撩得他心里发痒。他一阵发狂，真想追过去，坚信自己一定能把猎物追到手。这时，一只黑狐狸朝他走了过来，嘴里叼着一只松鸡。他大叫一声，声音大得怕人，吓得狐狸没命地逃窜，但是仍然没有丢掉松鸡。

傍晚时分，他沿着一条小溪朝前走，小溪流过长得稀稀拉拉的灯芯草草丛，溪水因为含有石灰而变成了乳白色。他用手抓紧灯芯草靠近根部的地方，揪下一些草芽——那些草芽像葱苗，只有瓦钉那么大，嫩嫩的，嚼起来很爽脆，味道似乎很不错。谁知那玩意儿的纤维却不容易咬断。它由一丝丝充满水分的纤维组成，跟沼地浆果一样，完全没有养分。他顾不了许多，甩掉行李卷，爬进灯芯草草丛，牛吃草那般大嚼大咽起来。

他非常疲倦，总希望能歇一会儿，躺下来睡个觉缓缓劲。然而，有一种力量在催促他向前——与其说是因为他渴望早一点抵达“小棍子之地”，倒不如说是饥饿在迫使他往前走。他在小水坑里找青蛙，又用指甲挖土找蚯蚓，尽管他也知道，在这遥远的北方是既没有青蛙也没有蚯蚓的。

遇到小水坑他就乱摸一通，次次都无功而返。最后，当暮色笼罩四野，他在一个水坑里总算发现了一条孤零零的小鱼，跟鲦鱼那么大。他把胳膊伸下水去抓，水一直没到肩头，而那条鱼一出溜就逃掉了。他两手并用去捉，把坑底的乳白色泥浆搅了起来。由于激动，他不慎掉进了水里，半个身子都浸湿了。水被搅浑，看不清鱼在哪儿，他只好等泥浆沉淀下去再说。

他又开始下劲捉鱼，水又一次被搅浑了。他一时焦急，便解下身上的白铁罐子，把坑里的水往外舀。起初，他发狂一样地舀，把水溅了一身，同时，泼出去的水因为距离水坑太近，又流了回来。后来，虽然他的心依旧扑通乱跳，手发抖，但谨慎了一些，尽量让自己冷静了下来。奋斗了半个小时后，坑里的氷已几乎被舀干，只剩下了一丁点儿。可是，鱼却不见了。他这才发现石头堆里面有一条暗缝，那条鱼已从暗缝钻到了旁边一个相连的大水坑，那大水坑里的水就是舀一天一夜也舀不干。要是早知道，就应该先用石头将暗缝堵死，鱼也就抓到手了。

他追悔莫及，四肢无力地瘫倒在潮湿的地上。起初他只是低声地啜泣，后来，他冲着那把他团团围住的无情的荒原号啕大哭了起来。大哭之后，又是一阵抽噎，他抽噎了许久许久。

他生起一堆火，喝了几夸脱(2)热水暖身子，然后按昨晚的那种方式在一块岩架上扎营。临睡前，他最后检查了一下火柴是否还是干燥的，并且上好表的发条。毯子潮湿、发黏。脚腕一跳一跳地疼。然而，他已经不在乎这些了，他所在乎的只是饥饿。睡觉睡不安宁，他老是梦见各种各样的酒席、宴会，梦见丰盛可口的饭菜。

醒来时，他浑身发冷，感到很不舒服。天上没有太阳。原本就灰蒙蒙的大地和天空，此时越显得昏天黑地。寒风刺骨，初雪落下，染白了山巅。他生了火，煮了些开水，周围的空气也越来越浓，最后成了白茫茫的一片。从天上掉下来的是半雨半雪，雪花是大片大片的，湿而软。起初，雪花一落地就化，后来雪越下越大，盖满了地面，扑灭了篝火，弄湿了他收集来当柴烧的干苔藓。

他见情况不妙，急忙背上行李卷往前走，一路跌跌撞撞，不知要去向何处。此刻，他想到的不是“小棍子之地”，不是比尔，也不是狄斯河边那条翻过来的独木舟下掩盖的地窖。他心里只有一个字，那就是“吃”。他简直饿疯了，根本不管自己走的路对不对，反正只要能走出眼前的水洼地就行。他在湿漉漉的雪地里摸索着前行，一路寻找着沼地浆果，遇见灯芯草便连根拔起。但这种东西索然无味，又不顶饥。后来，他发现了一种带酸味的野草，就找了来吃下肚子。可惜能找到的并不多，因为这种野草贴着地面生长，很容易被几英寸厚的雪埋住。

这天夜里，他生不成火，也没喝上热水，钻进毯子下蒙眬睡去，中间屡屡饿醒。雪变成了冰冷的雨水。雨滴落在他仰着的脸上，多次把他淋醒。第二天，天空一片铅色，仍没有太阳。雨已经停了。刀绞一样的饥饿感也消失了。他已经丧失了想吃食物的感觉，只觉得胃里隐隐作痛，但这对他的影响并不大。他的脑子比较清晰了，又能够专心致志思考到“小棍子之地”和狄斯河边那个地窖的事宜了。

他拿起那条残缺不全的毯子，把它撕成一条一条的，缠在血淋淋的脚上，又用几条当绷带裹在扭伤的脚腕上，为这一天的旅程做好准备。打包行李卷时，他看着那个鼓囊囊的鹿皮金袋思考良久，最后还是带着它上了路。

一场雨过后，雪已经融化了，只剩下山头还留着雪帽。太阳出来了，他总算能够定出罗盘的方位了，这时他方知自己迷了路。也许，在前两天的跋涉中，他往左边走，左得过了头。现在，为了校正方向，以便走上正道，他朝着右边走去。

饿得胃痛的感觉虽然不再那么强烈，他却觉得全身软弱无力，寻找沼地浆果和灯芯草时也不得不走两步便停下来歇口气。他的舌头发干、发胀，好像上面长满了细细的绒毛，嘴里有一种苦苦的味道。他的心脏给他添了不少麻烦。每走几分钟，他的心脏就会扑通扑通地猛跳一阵，然后像越来越急促的鼓点一样窜动着，让他痛苦不堪，使得他头晕目眩，喘不过气来。

中午时分，他在一个大水坑里发现了两条鲦鱼。要想把水舀干去捉鱼，那是不可能的。不过，他现在大脑很清晰，最后用白铁罐子把它们捞了起来。它们也不过只有他的小拇指那么大，好在他现在并不觉得特别饿。胃里的隐痛已经越来越弱，越来越麻木了。他的胃好像睡着了似的。他把鱼生吃下去，费劲地咀嚼着——进食已经成了一种纯理性的行为。他没有吃的欲望，却知道要活下去就必须吃。

到了傍晚，他又捉到了三条鲦鱼，当时就吃掉了两条，留下一条第二天作为早餐。此时，太阳已经晒干了剩下不多的几块苔藓，总算可以烧点热水喝下去暖身子了。在这一天里，他走了不到十英里的路；次日，由于心脏受不了，他走走停停，只走了不到五英里。不过，他的胃却没有一点不舒服的感觉，就像是进入了梦乡。他来到了一个陌生的地区，鹿越来越多，狼也多起来了。在荒芜的原野上不时会传来狼的号叫声，有一次他还瞧见三只狼从他前面的路上偷偷溜过。

又过了一夜。到了早晨，他变得比较理智了，于是就解开系着那鼓囊囊的鹿皮金袋的皮绳，敞开袋口倒出一股黄澄澄的粗金沙和金块，将这些金子大致分成了两堆，一堆包在一块毯子里，藏在一块显眼的岩石下，另一堆则放回了金袋。同时，他从剩下的那条毯子上又撕下几条布，用来裹脚。对于猎枪，他仍然舍不得丢掉，因为狄斯河边的地窖里藏有子弹。

这是一个大雾天。这一天，饥饿感又卷土重来了。他感到虚弱极了，饿得头昏眼花，有时候什么都看不见。打绊和摔跟头对于他已不是稀罕事。一次，他脚下一绊，一个跟头摔到了石松鸡的巢穴里，那里面有四只刚孵出的雏鸟，恐怕刚孵出一天吧——几只活蹦乱跳的小生命一口就能吃进肚。他把它们活生生塞到嘴里，像嚼蛋壳似的咀嚼着，狼吞虎咽地将它们全吃了。松鸡母亲咯咯咯地大叫着，扑闪着翅膀攻击他。他把枪当棍子狠劲打去，被它躲开了。他又用石块砸，其中有一块石头砸伤了它的翅膀。松鸡振翅一飞，扇着受伤的翅膀慌乱地逃跑了，而他在后边紧追不舍。

那几只雏鸡吊起了他的胃口。他拖着受伤的脚腕，一瘸一拐，跌跌撞撞地往前追，又是用石块砸，又是大声吆喝，有时则不声不响，摔倒了就咬咬牙爬起来，继续耐着性子追去；当满眼昏花，快看不见的时候，他用手揉揉眼睛，仍紧追不舍。

追逐中，他穿过了谷底的沼地，发现湿漉漉的苔藓上有一些脚印。那不是他自己的脚印——这他看得出来。一定是比尔的。不过，他不能停下，因为松鸡仍在逃窜。他必须先把它抓住，然后再拐回来查看脚印。

母松鸡被追得精疲力竭，他自己也累瘫了。它歪着身子倒在地上喘个不停，他也斜躺着呼哧呼哧喘粗气，中间仅仅隔着十来英尺的距离，然而他却没有力气爬过去。等他缓过劲时，它也歇了过来。当他急不可耐地伸手去抓时，它就扑棱扑棱翅膀逃到了他够不着的地方。这场追赶就这样一直持续着。直到夜晚，它终于逃掉了。他浑身软得像面条，脚下一绊，栽了个跟头，脸都磕破了，行李卷重重压在背上。他一动不动趴了许久，后来翻过身侧躺着，给表上了发条，在那儿一直躺到次日早晨。

这一天又是个大雾天。最后剩下的那条毯子有一半都被他当成了裹脚布。此时，他已经找不到比尔的脚印了。他已顾不上这许多了。饥饿已将他逼到了山穷水尽的地步。不过，他心里还是会掠过一丝思绪，觉得比尔可能也迷了路。到了中午时分，行李卷压得他有点不堪重负。他取出金袋，把金子又一分为二，将其中的一半胡乱扔在了地上。下午，他把剩下来的那一点也扔掉了。现在，他只有半条毯子、一个白铁罐子和那支猎枪了。

他脑子里开始出现了幻觉，总觉得还剩下一颗子弹在猎枪的枪膛里，只是他疏忽了，没想起来而已。可是另一方面，他也明明白白知道枪膛是空的。但这种幻觉挥之不去。他与之斗争，斗争了好几个小时。最后，他拉开了枪栓，面对的是一个事实——枪膛里空空如也。失望给他带来的是痛苦，仿佛他原先真的指望能看到那颗子弹似的。

他迈着沉重的步伐继续朝前走，走了半个小时，那种幻觉又出现了。他又与之斗争，可它却久久不肯离去，直到为了摆脱它，他又打开了枪膛，使自己不再幻想。有时候，他胡思乱想得越发离谱，脚下艰难跋涉，机械地挪动着步子，心里生出的各种稀奇古怪的想法和念头却像蛀虫一样啃噬着他的脑髓。不过，这类脱离现实的遐思每一次都只是昙花一现，撕心裂肺的饥饿感总会叫他重新回到现实中来。有一次，他从这种遐想中猛醒，被眼前的情景惊得差点没昏过去。他晃了几晃，就像个醉汉一样，努力不让自己摔倒。他觉得前边站着一匹马。天呀，那儿有一匹马！他简直不能相信自己的眼睛。就在这时，他感到眼前一黑，金星乱冒。他狠狠揉了揉眼睛，好让自己看清楚一些。这一下不当紧，他看到的不是马，而是一头大棕熊！那家伙一副好斗的样子，正好奇地盯着他瞧。

他举枪上肩，但中途意识到枪是空的，于是就又把枪放下，从腰间那镶着珍珠的刀鞘里拔出了猎刀。前面就是肉，吃了就能活命呀！他用大拇指试试刀刃，觉得刀刃很锋利，刀尖也很锋利。眼看他就要扑上去把熊杀死了。可是他的心脏却扑通扑通乱跳起来，向上一蹿一蹿地顶着心口——这一通乱跳像是给他的头勒上了紧箍咒，勒得他的大脑感到天旋地转。

这时，他的心里突然涌起一股强烈的恐惧感，驱散了那种发狠拼命的勇气。他弱得手无缚鸡之力，万一那头猛兽冲过来攻击他该如何是好？他只好手握猎刀，死死盯住那只熊，摆出一副极其吓人的姿势。那只熊笨手笨脚地跨近两步，直立起来，试探性地咆哮一声。此时，这个人要是跑，熊肯定会追，可是他没有跑。恐惧激发了他的勇气，使得他热血沸腾。他也咆哮一声，声音凶狠，充满了野性，宣泄出了在生死攸关的时刻那种紧紧抱住生命之根不肯撒手的恐惧。

熊见这个神秘的生物站得笔直，全无惧色，自己倒是有了几分怯意，于是向一旁退了几步，威胁性地吼了几声。可是他纹丝不动，似一尊雕像一样站在那儿，直到危险过去，才猛然哆嗦了一阵，瘫倒在湿漉漉的苔藓地上。

他重新振作起来，继续前进，心里又添了一种新的恐惧——他倒不害怕因为吃不到东西而被活活饿死，而是害怕不等饥饿耗尽他的最后一点求生力，自己就已经被活活吃掉了。此处狼多，狼嗥之声在荒原上四处飘荡，在空中织出了一张瘆人的大网，吓得他不由举起双手，要用力支撑住这顶被大风吹得歪斜的帐篷的篷布。

不时有狼从他面前三三两两地跑过。不过，那些狼都躲着他，一是因为它们的数量不多，二是由于它们要捕食的是驯鹿。驯鹿不会反抗，谁知道这个直立走路的奇怪生物会不会对它们又抓又咬呢。

傍晚时分，他碰见了一堆饿狼啃剩下的动物骨头。这堆七零八落的骨头在一个小时之前还是一只尖叫着逃窜的活蹦乱跳的小鹿！他打量着这些骨头，发现它们已经被啃得精光发亮，只剩下血髓在骨头表面泛着粉红色。在天黑之前，他说不定也会落得这种下场！生命就要这样结束了吗？它可真是一种虚无缥缈、转瞬即逝的东西！活着才会感到痛苦，死了就没有感觉了，就像睡着了一样。死亡意味着结束，意味着休息。可是，让他死，他为什么又于心不甘呢？

不过，对于这些大道理他没有思考过多，而是蹲在苔藓地上，拿起一根骨头放在嘴里，吮吸着那残余在骨头上微微泛红的血髓。他的嘴里泛起一股甜甜的肉味，那味道丝丝缕缕、隐隐约约，像思绪一般。这一吮叫他发了狂，只见他咬紧骨头，使劲地啃，有时咬碎了一点骨头，有时却硌碎了自己的牙。后来，他用石块砸那骨头，把它捣成酱吞到肚里。匆忙之中，他砸到了自己的指头上；使他感到惊奇的是，在石块砸在手指上的瞬间，他却未感到十分疼痛。

接下来的几天雨雪交加，天气十分糟糕。他都没有何时宿营、何时上路的概念了，而是日夜兼程地走。摔倒了，他就躺在那儿休息休息；一旦即将熄灭的生命火花闪烁起来，微微燃烧，他就又艰难地向前跋涉。作为一个人，他已经不再挣扎，而他体内的生命却不愿死去，逼着他朝前走。他不再感到痛苦，他的大脑神经已变得迟钝、麻木，脑海里充斥着怪异的幻象和美妙的梦境。

一路上，他把砸碎了的鹿骨取出来吮吸和咀嚼——这些残屑是他收集起来带着路上吃的。他不再翻山越岭，而是机械性地沿着一条流过一片宽阔浅谷的河流前行。无论是河水还是浅谷他一概视而不见，眼里只看得到种种幻象。灵魂和肉体虽然在同行，肩并肩地跋涉，然而它们又是分离的，联系它们的纽带极薄极弱。

一天，他一觉醒来，神智清楚地仰卧在一块突出的岩石上。阳光明媚、和煦。远处传来小鹿鸣叫的声音。他模模糊糊记得下过雨、刮过风、落过雪，可是他顶着风吹雨打究竟度过了两天还是两个星期，他就说不清了。

他一动不动地躺了一会儿。和煦的阳光洒在身上，让他那饱经苦难的躯体有了丝丝暖意。他心想这是一个晴好的日子。也许，他可以想办法确定自己的方位。他忍着痛苦一使劲，侧过身子来，发现脚下有一条水面开阔、缓缓流淌的大河。这一景象很是陌生，叫他感到惊奇。他顺着河水流淌的方向慢慢望去，只见那宽宽的水面蜿蜒穿行于光秃秃的、荒凉的山丘之间——那山丘比他以前所见过的任何山丘都更荒凉、更光秃、更低矮。随后，他慢慢地、从容地、心平气和地，或者说是漫不经心地又顺着这条陌生的河流流淌的方向望了一眼，把目光投向水天交接之处，看到它汇入了一片闪闪发光的明亮的大海。他仍然一副十分镇定的样子。他觉得眼前的情景极为反常，可能是幻象或海市蜃楼——多半是幻象，是他混乱的大脑臆想出来的。接着，他看见那明亮的大海上停泊着一艘轮船，于是就更加确信这是幻象了。他把眼睛闭了一会儿，然后又睁开。奇怪，幻象竟然还在那里！说奇怪，其实也没什么奇怪的。他知道荒原中央绝不会有什么大海或轮船，正像他知道自己的空枪里没有子弹一样。

这时，他听到背后有一种呼哧呼哧的声音——一种喘不过气或者咳嗽的声音。他翻转过身子来，由于虚弱和僵硬，动作非常缓慢。近旁什么也看不到。但是他耐心地等着。那呼哧呼哧的声音和咳嗽声又一次响起。在离他不到二十英尺远的两块锯齿状的岩石之间，他隐约看到了一只灰狼的脑袋。这只狼的尖耳朵并不像别的狼那样支棱着，它双眼浑浊无光、布满血丝，脑袋有气无力地耷拉着，一副惨相。在阳光下，这头野兽不时地眨巴着眼睛，像是生病了。就在他张望之际，那只狼又发出了呼哧呼哧的呼吸和咳嗽声。

至少这副情景是真的，他想，于是他又翻了个身，将身子转向另一侧，想看看刚才被幻象遮住的现实世界。可是，远处仍可见那片闪闪发光的大海，那艘轮船也依旧历历在目。难道这就是现实世界？他闭着眼睛，想了好一会儿，终于想清楚了。原来，他一直在朝着北偏东方向走，早已离开狄斯分水岭，走到了科珀曼山谷。这条水面开阔、缓缓流淌的大河就是科珀曼河。那片闪闪发光的大海是北冰洋。那艘轮船是捕鲸船，本应该驶往麦肯齐河口的，却偏东了，向东边偏得太远了，目前停泊在加冕湾里。他记起了很久以前看到过的那张哈德逊湾公司的图表，觉得一切都清楚了，一切都是合情合理的。

他坐起来，把注意力放在了眼前的事上。裹在脚上的毯子已经磨穿，一双脚血肉模糊，没有一处好肉；最后的一条毯子被撕成条，用光了；猎枪和猎刀都不见了；帽子不知在什么地方丢了，帽圈里那包火柴也一块儿丢了，但贴胸放在烟草袋里的那几根用油纸包着的火柴还在，而且是干的。他检查了一下怀表，看到它仍在走，时针指着十一点。显然，他一直没有忘记给表上发条。

他冷静下来、精力集中，虽然身体极度虚弱，却感觉不到痛苦。他已经不再感到饥饿了，即便想到食物，也不觉得愉悦。现在，他无论做什么，都是凭着理性。他齐膝撕下了两截裤腿，把它们裹在脚上。那只白铁罐子他总算还保留了下来。他将烧些开水喝，然后向轮船那儿进发——他预料到那将是一段极其艰难的旅途。

他的一举一动都很缓慢，浑身哆嗦，就像中风了一样。当他准备去收集一些干苔藓生火时，却怎么也站不起来了。他尝试了几次，最后只好手脚并用地爬行了。有一次他爬到了那只病狼附近。那头野兽一面很不情愿地拖着身子躲开他，一面用它那好像连弯一下的力气都没有的舌头舔着自己的上下颚。他注意到病狼的舌头不是通常那种健康的红色，而是一种暗黄色，好像蒙着一层粗糙的、半干的黏液。

后来，他喝了一品脱的热水，总算可以站起来了，甚至还能走路了，但就像濒临死亡的人那样，身子一摇一晃的，走几步就得停下来歇一歇。他的步子软弱无力，很不稳，而跟在他身后的病狼也同样脚步不稳，踉踉跄跄的。夜里，闪闪发光的大海笼罩在黑暗之中，他知道自己和大海之间的距离恐怕只缩短了不足四英里。

这一整夜，他老听到那只病狼在咳嗽，还会不时听到小鹿呦呦的叫声。他周围全是生命，不过那是强壮的生命，非常活跃而健康的生命，同时他也知道，那只病狼之所以要紧跟着他这个病人，是希望他先死。次日早晨，他一睁眼就看到那头野兽正用一种居心不良、饥肠辘辘的目光瞅着他。它夹着尾巴卧在那儿，像一条穷途末路的丧家犬，在清晨的寒风中瑟瑟发抖。他鼓起劲，对它呵斥一声，声音又低又哑，而那家伙只是有气无力地朝他龇了龇牙。

太阳升起，光芒万丈。他跋涉了一个上午，跌跌绊绊地朝着闪闪发光的大海上的那艘轮船走去。天气好极了。此时正值高纬度地区的小阳春，非常短暂，可能只有一个星期，也许明后天就会结束。

下午，他发现了一些痕印，那是另外一个人留下的——并非走路留下的足印，而是爬行留下的印迹。他觉得那可能是比尔留下的，不过他对此麻木不仁、漠不关心，已经一点兴趣都没有了。事实上，他内心的热忱和感情已荡然无存。他也不再感到痛苦。他的胃和神经都处于睡眠状态。但是，他体内的生命还在，正是这种生命在催促他向前。他已疲倦到了极点，但生命不愿意消亡。由于生命拒绝死去，他才仍然要吃沼地浆果和鲦鱼，要喝热水，要一直提防着那只病狼。

他跟着比尔爬行留下的印迹朝前走，很快就走到了头——只见湿漉漉的苔藓地上乱扔着几根刚啃光不久的骨头，骨头上还留有许多狼的爪印。他发现了一个鼓囊囊的鹿皮金袋，跟他自己的那个一模一样，已经被狼的利齿咬破了。按说他手脚无力，是提不起金袋的，但他一用劲还是将其拎了起来。比尔至死都没有把金子扔掉。哈！哈！比尔可真是太可笑了。他将活下去，带着比尔的金子到闪闪发光的大海里的那艘轮船上去。他的笑声沙哑、恐怖，跟乌鸦的怪叫一样，而那只病狼也随着他发出嗷呜嗷呜的惨叫。蓦然，他收住了笑声。如果此处真是比尔死去的地方，如果这些发红发白、被啃得精光的骨头真是比尔的遗骨，他怎么能加以嘲笑呢？

他转身走开了。不错，比尔抛弃了他，但他绝不能因此就拿走比尔的金子，也绝不能吮吸比尔的骨头以求自己活命。话又说回来，要是换上比尔，比尔恐怕会这么做的。他一边沉思着，一边踉踉跄跄地向前挪着步子。

他走到了一个水坑跟前，弯下腰在水里找鱼，却突然像被蜜蜂蜇了一下，把头缩了回去。原来，他在水里看见了自己的倒影，发现他的那张脸变得十分吓人。这一印象久久不散，让他感到震惊。水坑里有三条鲦鱼，可是坑太大，水是舀不干的；他用白铁罐子去捉，试了几次都功亏一篑，最后只好放弃。他生怕自己会由于极度虚弱，跌进水坑里淹死。也正是因为这一层原因，尽管沙洲上有许多原木，他也不敢骑上一根顺着河流漂向大海。

这一天，他把自己和那条船之间的距离缩短了三英里；次日缩短了两英里——因为这天他是爬行的，跟比尔生前一样。到了第五天晚上，他发现那条船距离他仍有七英里，而他一天连一英里也爬不了了。小阳春的天气仍在持续，他继续朝前爬，中途屡次昏过去又醒过来，那只病狼始终跟在他后面，又是咳嗽又是呼哧呼哧地喘气。他的膝盖已经和他的脚一样鲜血淋漓，尽管他撕下了身上的衬衫来垫膝盖，仍然在身后的苔藓和岩石上留下了一路血迹。他曾回头看了看，发现那只狼正在饥不择食地舔他洒在路上的血。从中，他清楚地看到了或许将会出现的结局……除非……除非他先把狼干掉。眼前正上演着一场无比悲惨的求生悲剧——有病的人挣扎着向前爬行，有病的狼一摇一晃跟在后边，两个生物拖着垂死之躯走在荒原上，进行着你死我活的斗争。

要是一只健康的狼把他吃掉，倒也罢了，可是一想到自己要喂这么一只令人作呕、只剩下一口气的狼，他就心生厌恶。对此他还是比较挑剔的。他又开始神游他方了，脑子里出现的种种幻象搅得他像是吃了迷魂药一般，清醒的时候少，糊涂的时候多。

一次昏厥后，他被贴着耳朵根响起的呼哧呼哧的喘息声惊醒了。那只病狼见他醒来，不由瘸着腿朝后一跳，虚弱得立足不稳，摔倒在了地上。那情景可笑极了，可是他一点也不觉得有趣，甚至也不感到后怕。到了这种地步，他的恐惧感早已飞到了九霄云外。不过，这会儿他的脑子倒是挺清醒的。于是他躺在那儿，思考了起来。那艘轮船离他还有不到四英里远，他只要揉一揉浑浊的眼睛，就能清楚地看见。他还看得见有一只小船鼓起白帆，劈波斩浪地航行在闪闪发光的大海上。可是，这四英里的路他爬是爬不到的。对此他是很清楚的，即便如此，他也并不感到惊惶。他知道，自己恐怕连半英里也爬不动了。然而，他渴望活下去。吃了那么多的苦，老天爷不会允许他此时死掉。命运对他实在太苛刻了。尽管奄奄一息，他还是不愿就这样去见阎王爷。也许，这只不过是他表现出的一股疯劲，但即便落入了死神的魔爪，他也要挣扎一番，拒绝走上黄泉路。

他闭上眼睛，提高了警惕，让自己平静下来。疲倦感像潮水一般涌遍全身各处，而他坚强地振作起精神，免得被这潮水所淹没。要命的疲倦感似汹涌的大海，翻起一个个浪头，一点一点地在淹没他的意识。有时候，他几乎完全被吞没，只是双手胡乱划动，在那茫茫的潮水上浮沉；后来，他的魂魄又奇特地回转了来，求生的意识随之浮现，变得比之前还要强烈。

他一动不动地仰面躺着，耳朵听得见病狼呼哧呼哧的喘息声，一呼一吸的，离他越来越近了。病狼在步步逼近，而他始终躺着未动。不知过了多长时间之后，它已经到了他耳边，又干瘪又粗糙的舌头就像砂纸一样磨着他的脸颊。他的两只手伸了出去——或者，他至少是凭着意志逼着那双手伸了出去。他的指头弯得像鹰爪一样，可是却抓了个空。敏捷和准确是需要力气的，而他没有这份力气。

病狼的耐心可真是惊人，他的耐心也同样惊人。这一天，一半时间他都躺着不动，苦苦挣扎着不让自己失去意识，等着那只想吃掉他的狼，而他也渴望吃掉对方。有时候，疲倦感像海水涌来将他淹没，使他深陷梦境；然而，无论是梦还是醒，他自始至终都在等待着那呼哧呼哧的喘息声响起，等待着粗糙的狼舌来舔他。

他一直没有听到那喘息声。后来，当他慢慢从一场梦里醒来时，感觉到那条舌头在舔他的手。他静静地等着。狼牙轻轻地咬在了他的手上，越咬越紧——病狼拼尽最后一丝力气要将牙齿咬进自己等待已久的食物里。这一刻他也等了许久，只见他用那只被咬破了的手一把抓住了狼颚。病狼无力地挣扎着，他的手也同样无力地抓住不放，另一只手则慢慢摸过来，双手将狼箍住。五分钟后，他把全身的重量都压在了狼的身上。他手上的力量虽然还不足以把狼掐死，可是他的脸已经紧紧地压住了狼的咽喉，咬得嘴里满是狼毛。咬了有半个小时的时间，他感到一小股温热的液体慢慢流进了他的喉咙。这东西并不好喝，就像硬灌到他胃里的铅液，而且完全是凭着他自己的意志硬灌下去的。后来，他翻过身，仰面朝天地睡着了。




“贝德福德号”捕鲸船上有几个科学考察队的队员，他们从甲板上望见岸上有个奇怪的目标物，它正沿着沙滩朝着海水移动。他们看不清那是什么，但由于是科考人员，需要探个究竟，于是就上了一条在旁边作业的小船向岸边驶去。他们发现它是有生命的，不过很难把它称作人。它什么也看不见，没有了任何意识，就像只大爬虫一样在地上蠕动着。它付出的努力十有八九都会落空，但它锲而不舍，扭动着身体吃力地向前爬着，一小时大概也爬不了二十英尺。




三个星期后的一天，这个人躺在“贝德福德号”捕鲸船的小床上，消瘦的脸上热泪纵横，说出了他的身份以及他所经历的磨难。他用含混不清的声音、断断续续的语句谈及他的母亲，谈及阳光灿烂的南加利福尼亚，以及橘林和花丛中的家园。

没过几天，他就跟那些科考队队员以及船员坐在同一张桌子旁边吃饭了。望着丰盛的食物，他目光贪婪，看着食物进入别人的口中，总有些不情愿。别人每每咽下一口饭菜，他的眼里都会显露出深深的惋惜。他的神智非常清醒，可是每逢吃饭的时候，他都会怨恨同桌进餐的人。一种恐惧感老是萦绕在他的心间——他怕船上的食物吃不了多长时间。不知有多少次，他询问厨子、船舱服务生和船长，问船上贮存的食物够不够吃，那些人每次都叫他放宽心。可是，他不相信他们的话，依旧会疑神疑鬼地溜到贮藏室那儿亲自窥探。

大家留意到他在发福，像发面团一样每天胖一点。科考队队员见了直摇头，给他讲了科学道理，限制他的食量，可是他的腰围仍在增加，衣服下的身体仍在膨胀。

水手们都咧着嘴笑——他们是知道内情的。科考队队员观察后也知道了其中的缘故。他们发现他吃过早饭后就四处转悠，遇见哪个水手就截住人家，像个乞丐一样伸手要吃的。水手会笑笑，递给他一块硬面包。他贪婪地把面包抓在手里看着它，就像守财奴看黄金那样，然后将其塞进怀里。其他水手遇见这种情况，也会笑一笑向他赠送面包。

科考队队员不动声色，什么也没说，而是暗中检查了他的床铺，发现那儿满都是硬面包，连褥子下也塞满了，每个角落都被硬面包塞得严严实实。他的脑子很正常，这样做只是以备不时之需，以防再次饿肚子——仅此而已。科考队队员说他以后会恢复正常的。果真，未等“贝德福德号”捕鲸船在旧金山湾里抛锚，他就已经恢复了正常。

生火


破晓时分，天气寒冷，四周灰蒙蒙一片，简直是刺骨般的寒冷，昏天黑地的。他离开育空大道，爬上了高高的泥土河岸，这儿有一条少有人走的凄凉的小径向东通往又粗又壮的云杉树林。河岸的坡度很陡，他爬到顶时停下来喘气。他看了看表，也算给自己找了个歇气的理由。此时是九点钟，虽然天空没有一片云彩，却也没有太阳，亦没有出太阳的迹象。虽然是晴天，却似乎有一种无形的、朦胧的东西覆盖在一景一物之上，一种难以名状的阴森气氛使得天色越发昏暗，这全都是因为没有太阳所致。有没有太阳他并不在意，反正他已经习以为常了。他已多日不见阳光，而且他知道还得再过几天，那个叫人心情愉悦的火球才会从正南方向的地平线上探出头来，然后又会很快消失。

他回头看了一眼自己走过的路。育空河宽达一英里，深藏于三英尺厚的冰层下，冰上覆盖着数英尺厚的雪，望上去一片洁白，在流冰拥塞处微微起伏。极目远眺，南方和北方都是一望无际的白色，唯有一条深色的细线弯弯曲曲地绕过云杉覆盖的小岛向南伸去，再弯弯曲曲地一路向北，最后隐没于另一个云杉覆盖的小岛的后面。那条深色的细线是一条小径，它向南五百英里通向迪耶(1)附近的奇尔库特山隘，通向海边，向北七十英里则通往道森，再向北一千英里通往努拉托，最后到达一千五百英里外靠近白令海的圣迈克尔。

不过，那条神秘、绵长如细线一般的道路，那不见太阳的天空，那刺骨的寒冷，那离奇古怪的景色，所有的这一切并没有对他产生任何影响。这倒不是因为他对此久已习惯。其实，他初来乍到，是一个“新人”，这是他来此处的第一个冬天。问题在于他缺乏想象力。他对于周遭的事物反应灵敏而机警，但仅仅局限于对事物本身的了解，对其中所包含的深意却不甚了了。零下五十度意味着冰点下八十多度(2)。他只觉得天气很冷，让他很不舒服，仅此而已。他没有推想到自己作为恒温动物的脆弱，没有推想到人体一般来说是很娇气的，只能生活在一定的冷热范围之内，也没有继而推想到关于永恒以及人类在宇宙中的位置的问题。零下五十度会形成霜冻，给人体造成伤害，必须戴手套、护耳帽，穿鹿皮鞋和厚袜子加以保护。而对他来说，零下五十度就是零下五十度，至于其他的方面，他并没有多想。

他把目光收回来继续往前走，边想心事，边随口吐了一口唾沫。只听噼啪一声响，像是什么东西炸裂了一样，吓了他一大跳。他又吐了一口，又是一声响，那口唾液未等落地，在空中就冻成冰炸裂了。他知道，零下五十度时唾液在雪地上会冻成冰炸裂开，可是在空中炸裂开就叫人费解了。毫无疑问，实际气温要低于零下五十度，至于低多少他就不得而知了。不过，气温低不低无关紧要。此行，他要到亨德森河的左岔口去干他的老行当，伙计们已候在那儿了。那些人来自印第安河流域，是翻越分水岭过来的，而他则绕道而去，想看看是否有可能在春季把原木从育空河一带的小岛上运出去。他将在六点钟到达营地，那时天黑不久，晚是晚了些，但那儿有朋友们迎候，有篝火和晚餐。至于午餐么，他用手按了按外套下的那个鼓囊囊的包裹。一些面包被用手帕包住，紧紧贴着皮肤放在衬衣下面——只有这样，面包才不至于冻硬。一想到把这些面包切成片，在咸肉油里浸一浸，再夹上一大片煎咸肉吃下去，他就美滋滋地笑了。

他钻入高大的云杉林里。林间的道路轮廓模糊，前边倒是有雪橇经过，但后来又落了一英尺厚的雪。他庆幸自己没有乘雪橇，而是轻装行进。事实上他什么也没带，只有那份用手帕包了的午餐在身上。不过，天气如此寒冷，却叫他始料未及。他感到浑身冷极了，不由得用戴着手套的手揉了揉冻麻了的鼻头和脸颊。他留着串脸胡，那胡子可以遮住脸，却遮不住髙高的颧骨，也遮不住高耸在寒风中的大鼻子。

他屁股后边跟着一只大狗，一只土生土长的爱斯基摩狗，一只地道的狼狗，灰色的皮毛，与其野狼兄弟在外表和性情上没什么区别。极度的严寒天气叫它情绪低落。它很清楚，这种天气根本不适合出门旅行。它的本能比人的判断力要灵验。实际上，此时的气温之低不仅仅是零下五十度，恐怕已超过零下六十度，乃至超过零下七十度了。此时的气温是零下七十五度。鉴于融冰点为零上三十二度，这就意味着此时为冰点以下一百零七度。对于温度计那一套，狗一无所知。也许，它对于极度严寒的天气并不具备人的那种清醒的认识，但它的本能却很管用。它感到一种模糊而不祥的忧虑，而这种忧虑在搅扰、压抑着它，使得它紧随主人身后，用质疑的目光望着主人反常的一举一动，似乎在盼望着主人赶快到营地去，或者找个地方避寒，生一堆火取暖。它知道篝火的好处，它渴望有一堆火，要不然就在雪下面挖个洞钻进去，躲开这刺骨的寒风。

它呼出的气即刻凝固成极细的霜粉，落到皮毛上，尤其是它的面颊、口鼻和睫毛上，已经被这种结晶的气体染白了。主人那红色的胡子也结上了霜，而且结得更加紧实，他每呼出一口热气，霜和冰就会增加一分。在这种情况下，他还要嚼烟叶，冰块牢牢地附着在唇边，使得他在吐出汁液后无法把下巴擦干净。结果，他的胡子成了水晶状，具有了琥珀的颜色和硬度，在下巴上变得越来越长。假如他此刻跌倒，胡子一定会像玻璃一样摔成无数碎片。但是，他对此并不在意，当地咀嚼烟草的人无不受到如此惩罚，再说他以前外出时也曾两次遇到寒潮。只不过那两次都不如这次冷，据六十英里站的酒精温度计显示，那两次的气温分别是零下五十度和零下五十五度。

他穿过平川上连绵数英里的树林一路向前，横跨一片布满系船柱的平展、宽阔的沙滩，走下一处河岸，来到了一条结了冰的小河边。这就是亨德森河。他知道他离岔口还有十英里的路。看看表，十点正。按每小时走四英里计算，他估计可在十二点半到达岔口。他决定在那儿吃午饭以示庆贺。

他摇摇晃晃地沿着河床前行，狗沮丧地耷拉着尾巴，一路紧跟着他。雪橇留下的旧痕清晰可见，但自从最后一辆雪橇驶过，车道上又落了十多英寸厚的雪。河岸边寂静一片，此处已有一个月没有见行人出现过了。他脚不停步，继续向前走去。他平时就不喜欢思考问题，此时更是如此——他一门心思要赶到岔口吃午饭，然后于六点钟抵达营地与伙计们会合，其他的事情一概不考虑。他没人说话，即便有也不可能说话，因为他的嘴上挂满了冰碴子。于是他就一个劲地嚼烟叶，使得他那琥珀色的胡须由于结冰变得越来越长。

每隔一会儿，他就会想到天气真冷，想到自己从来没有遇到过这么冷的天气。他一边走，一边用戴着手套的手背揉脸颊和鼻头，双手机械性地交替揉着。尽管如此，只要他的手一停下，脸颊照样会发麻，紧接着鼻头也会发麻。他觉得他的脸颊一定会冻坏的。他知道一定会的，心里不由后悔至极，后悔没有给帽子上安装巴德的那种防寒用的鼻带。那种鼻带遮在脸上，可以起到保护脸颊的作用。不过，有没有鼻带关系也不大。脸颊即便被冻上了，那又怎么样？只不过疼一疼罢了，不会很严重的。

他虽大脑空空，却眼观六路，注意着河道的变化，细心观察着那些弯道和树丛，每走一步都留意着脚下。一次，他绕过一个弯道时，倏然一惊，像受惊的马一样猛地倒退几步，绕开了自己一直走着的那条路。他知道这条河已经冻透——在北极的冬天，没有一条河是可以流淌的。但他也知道，有些泉水会从山坡上流下来，在白雪的覆盖下流淌在冰冻的河面上。他知道这些泉水天气再冷也不会被冻住，并深知它们的危险。它们简直是一个个陷阱——一汪汪的水在雪下面形成小水洼，大约有三英寸深，有的地方甚至深达三英尺。有时，水洼上会结半英寸厚的薄冰，而冰面上覆盖着白雪。有的水洼是一层水夹一层薄冰，人不小心踩上去，就会将一层层的冰踏碎，深陷其中，有时水深及腰。

正是因为有这种现象，他才惊得连连后退。他感到两脚在下沉，听见雪下面的薄冰发出咔嚓咔嚓的破裂声。这样冷的天气把脚弄湿，会给他带来麻烦和危险，至少会耽误他的行程。那时，他就不得不停下来生堆火，一边烤鞋袜，一边烤脚取暖。他站在那里仔细观察着河床及河岸，断定水是从右边流过来的。他思考片刻，揉了揉鼻头和脸颊，然后绕到左侧，谨小慎微地摸索着前行，每走一步都要试探着先踩一下路面。走出危险地段之后，他又嚼了几口烟叶，接着便大步流星，按照原来的那种每小时四英里的速度继续赶路了。

在随后两个小时里他又遇到了几个类似的“陷阱”。通常是覆盖在水洼上面的雪有明显的凹陷，一看就知道有危险。不过，有一次他差点掉进水中。还有一次，他怀疑有危险，便逼着狗走到前面去。狗不愿意，直朝后缩，而他推着它朝前走。无奈，狗飞快地从看似牢固的雪地上跑过，突然踏破了冰层，掉了下去。它挣扎着到达水洼边，爬上了一处结实些的地方。它的前爪和腿被水浸湿，上面的水几乎瞬间就结了冰。它急忙把腿上的冰舔掉，然后卧在雪地上开始用牙齿咬掉爪趾间的冰碴。这是一种本能的反应。如果让冰碴留在那儿，它的爪子会被冻伤。它并不了解其中的道理，只不过是受到内心深处一种神秘力量的驱动而那样做的。而那个人却是知道这个道理的，并据此做出了判断——只见他摘掉右手的手套，帮着它清理冰碴。手套摘掉没超过一分钟，他就惊讶地发觉手指很快就被冻麻了。天气真是太冷了！慌得他急忙将手套又戴上，并把手狠劲捶在胸口上以消除麻木感。

此时是十二点钟，天空一天里最明亮的时候。不过，冬天的太阳还在遥远的南方，尚未冒出地平线。在地平线与亨德森河之间，他行走的这片区域丘陵起伏，天气晴朗，但却看不到自己的影子。十二点半整，他到达了河湾的岔口。他很满意自己行走的速度，心想照此速度一定能在下午六点跟伙计们会合。他解开外套和衬衣的纽扣，取出午餐。这一举动所用的时间没超过十五秒，但就在这短暂的一瞬间，他露出的手指就被冻麻了。他没急着戴手套，双手往大腿上狠狠拍打了十多下，然后坐在一根白雪覆盖的原木上准备吃东西。这一通拍打之后，手指感到一阵剧痛，但剧痛很快又消失了，这叫他觉得意外。他简直连咬一口面包的机会都没有。他又将手指在大腿上拍打了几下，然后戴上手套，同时把另一只手露出来吃东西用。他想下嘴去咬面包，可是胡子上的冰让他咬不成。怪都怪他忘了要生火先把冰融化掉。他扑哧笑出了声，笑自己傻里傻气的。而就在他笑的时候，他注意到自己裸露的手指又开始悄然发麻了。他还注意到，他坐下时脚趾刚刚感到的刺痛，现在已经消失。真不知那是因为脚趾暖和了过来还是被冻麻了。他让脚趾在鹿皮鞋里动了动，断定它们是被冻麻了。

他慌不迭又将手套戴上，站起了身，心里觉得有点害怕。他在地上不停地跺脚，直至又产生了那种刺痛感。他心想，这鬼天气实在太冷了。硫黄湾(3)来的那个人曾说过这个地区有时候冷如冰窖，看来此言不虚。他当时还嘲笑人家呢！这说明：一个人万不能自以为是。那人说寒冷，这可是千真万确的事实。他来回踱步，又是跺脚又是抡胳膊，最后总算有了几分暖意。接下来，他取出火柴，准备生火。在身边的矮树丛里，有许多以前河面水位还高时留下的干树枝，他取来做柴火，小心点着，火势由小变大，很快就熊熊燃烧起来。他把脸上的冰烤化，在火的保护下吃了些面包。一时间，寒冷被火战胜了。狗烤着火，一副心满意足的样子。它尽量靠近火堆，同时又注意着不让火烧焦自己的皮毛。

他吃完午餐，填满了烟管，舒舒服服地抽了一会儿，然后戴上手套，让帽子的护耳紧紧罩住耳朵，沿着河道向左岔口走去。狗很失望，渴望回到篝火旁。这个人简直就不知道什么叫作寒冷。也许他祖祖辈辈就没有尝过寒冷是什么滋味，不知道什么是真正的寒冷，不知道冰点以下一百零七度的寒冷是怎么个情况。但这条狗却是知道的，它祖祖辈辈对此都一清二楚——这是一种世代相传的知识。它知道：在这种天寒地冻的时候出行有害无益；寒潮到来时，应该挖个雪洞躲进去，直至空中寒云散开才出来(4)。不过，这条狗和这个人之间的关系并不是十分亲密。它只不过是他的奴隶罢了，它所受到的唯一的关爱就是鞭打，要不然就是听到主人威吓它，发出啪啪的抽鞭子的声音。所以，它无心也无意把内心的担忧传达给主人。它渴望回到篝火旁，并非为主人的安危着想，而是为了它自身考虑。可是，主人吹了声口哨，啪啪啪地模仿了几声抽鞭子的声音，吓得它只好乖乖跟在他的后边，又踏上了行程。

他嚼了一些烟叶，胡子又变成了琥珀色，呼出的湿气很快化为白色粉末，落到胡须、眉毛和睫毛上。亨德森河左边支流上的暗泉似乎并不多见，他走了半小时也没有察觉到任何踪迹。接着，祸从天降。他来到一处，并没有看见泉水，只看得见平展、柔软的白雪，好像下面是坚实的冰，却一脚踩进了水里。水不深，他急忙跳到了坚实的冰面上，然而膝部以下还是被水浸湿了。

他怒不可遏，大骂自己倒了血霉。他原指望六点钟赶到营地跟朋友们会合，这下可得耽误一个小时了，因为他必须生火烤干鞋袜。气温如此之低，生火很有必要，他非常清楚这一点，于是转身要去岸上，只能爬过去。岸上的灌木丛里有一些和之前一样的干柴，缠结在几棵小云杉树的树干上——主要是细枝细条，但也有大一些的枝条和去年的细干草。他把几根粗大一些的树枝丢到雪地上，垫在下面，以免最初的小火被融化的雪水浸灭。随后，他从衣袋里取出一小块桦树皮，擦了火柴把它点燃。桦树皮甚至比纸燃烧得还快。他把它放在柴堆上，再添上一把把干草和极为细小的干枝。

他深知自己身处险境，生火时十分当心，动作缓慢。火势渐渐加大，他添加的树枝也越来越粗。他蹲在雪地上，把绞缠在灌木丛中的树枝一根根抽出来，直接添进火里。他知道自己只能成功不能失败。当气温在零下七十五度时，要生火，是容不得失败的（这是指在鞋袜被水浸湿的情况下）。如果鞋袜是干的，即使火没生着，他还可以跑上半英里，让血液流动起来就是了。可在零下七十五度时，对于又湿又冻的脚，血液是不可能恢复循环的。无论他跑得多快，湿脚也只会被冻得更厉害。

对这些情况，他是非常清楚的。硫黄湾的那个老江湖去年秋天曾给他分享过经验，此刻他对那一番指点心存感激。他的脚已完全失去了知觉。为了生火他不得不取下手套，结果手指很快便冻麻了。他以每小时四英里的速度赶路时，心脏将血液输送到体表以及身体的各个部位。但一停下来，血液的输送就放缓了。太空的寒潮袭击着毫无保护的地球的顶端(5)，而他身处这一区域，正承受着那寒潮的强大的冲击。他体内的血液在寒潮面前畏首畏尾，虽然像那只狗一样仍具有生命力，但也像狗一样唯恐避而不及，恨不得找个地缝钻进去，以躲过这可怕的寒冷。只要他以每小时四英里的速度走起来，血液便可以输送到体表，而现在，血液却像潮水一般，慢慢退去了，退到了身体的某个幽深之处。最先有失血感觉的是他的四肢。虽然还没有完全冻僵，但他湿脚的冻伤在加剧，裸露出的手指也越冻越麻。他的鼻子和脸颊都快冻成了冰块，皮肤因失血而变得冰冷。

不过，他尚无丧命之忧。脚趾、鼻子和脸颊只不过稍微挨冻而已，篝火已经越烧越旺了。他把手指般粗细的树枝添进火里，不一会儿就可以添入手腕粗细的树枝了。那时他便可脱去鞋袜，一边把它们烤干，一边把光着的脚烤暖和——当然，烤脚之前，先要用雪把它们擦一遍。火算是生着了，他算是安全了。想起硫黄湾那个老江湖的话，他不由微微一笑。那老兄曾语气郑重地说，气温到了零下五十度，谁也别指望能独身一人穿过克朗代克河(6)流域。他这不是来了吗？路上遇到过危险，他单枪匹马地克服，最终活了下来。他不以为然地觉得，那些老江湖中有的人未免有些娘儿们气了。一个人只要下定决心，就能够成功。只要你是个英雄汉，独身走路算什么！不过，让他感到意外的是，他的脸颊和鼻子冻僵的速度竟如此之快。他也没想到自己的手指会在这么短的时间失去知觉。由于手指没有了活力，他几乎无法用它们抓取树枝——那些手指就好像脱离了他的躯体，脱离了他本人。他摸到树枝时，不得不先看看是不是用手抓住了——那树枝其实就在他的指间。

这一切都算不了什么。反正火已经生着了，在毕毕剥剥地燃烧，每一个跳动的火苗都给人以生的希望。他开始解鞋带。鹿皮鞋上结了一层冰，齐膝长的厚厚的德国袜子冻得简直成了铁板一块，而鞋带则像淬过火，成了麻花状的铁条纠缠在一起。他摸索着用麻木的手指解鞋带，后来意识到这是无用的愚蠢之举，便从刀鞘里将刀抽了出来。

可是，他还没来得及用刀割断鞋带，祸事就发生了。怪只怪他自己处理不当，或者说他犯了一个错误。他本来就不该在云杉树下生火，他应该把火生在空地上。当初只图方便——在云杉树下，可以从树丛中抽出细枝，直接投入火里。岂不知就在这棵云杉树上，积雪压弯了树枝。几个星期没刮过风，每一个枝杈上都堆着厚厚的雪。每次他抽取枝条，云杉树就会微微一颤——那种颤动极其轻微，他难以察觉，但是足以导致灾难的发生。在这棵树的高处，一根树杈上的积雪掉了下来，砸在了下边的树杈上，结果引起连锁反应，面积越来越广，最终导致整棵树上的积雪纷纷掉落，像雪崩一样，猛地砸向他的后背，盖在了篝火上，一下子就把火压灭了！刚才还是一堆熊熊燃烧的火，这当儿只剩杂乱的白雪铺地，一片狼藉。

他慌了神，就好像刚刚听到了死刑判决书，呆呆地坐在那里，痴痴望着刚才还篝火熊熊的地方。后来，他稳定住了情绪。看来，硫黄湾的那个老江湖所言不差。哪怕路上有一个人跟他结伴而行，他也不至于陷入这样的险境。遇见这种情况，同伴可以为他把火生着。这下子他得靠自己再次生火了，而这一次是容不得失手的。即便把火生着了，他也有很大的可能会冻坏几根脚趾。此刻，他的脚大概已严重冻伤，而把火再次生着还需要一些时间。

他心里转着这些念头，不过他并不是耽于思考、坐以待毙，而是一边想一边行动着。他又为篝火铺了一个基架——这次是在空地上，不用担心树上掉雪砸灭火苗。然后，他从泉水冲来的杂物中找到一些干草和细枝。在这一过程，他手指动弹不得，只能用两个手掌去抽取。这样，他搞到了许多腐枝和绿苔，并非理想的燃料，但也只能凑合着用了。他有条不紊地准备着，还弄来一抱粗一些的树枝，准备等火旺之后添入。这段时间，狗始终卧在那里观望，眼里充满了渴望——它指望着他提供篝火，可是那火却迟迟生不着。

一切准备妥当后，他把手伸进衣袋，打算再取出一块桦树皮来。他知道桦树皮就在那儿，虽然手指没有了感觉，但摸索时可以听见桦树皮在窸窣作响。他使出了吃奶的力气，却无法用手抓牢它。此时，他一直意识清楚，知道自己脚上的冻伤每时每刻都在加重。这一意识让他深陷恐惧之中，但他与之搏斗，竭力保持镇静。他用牙齿叼起手套戴在手上，然后前后甩胳膊，双手用力拍打身子两边。活动时，他时而坐下，时而站起。狗自始至终卧在雪地上观看，狼一般的尾巴卷起来盖在前爪上取暖，支棱着野狼似的尖耳朵。主人又是拍打手，又是甩胳膊，见狗天然一身皮毛，暖和、安然地卧在那儿，突然感到一阵强烈的忌妒。

过了一会儿，他那麻木的手指开始隐隐约约有了一丝感觉，先是感到微微有点疼痛，继而疼痛感加剧，最后成了针扎一般的剧痛。而他却高兴得喊出了声。他摘下右手的手套掏出桦树皮，而露出的手指又很快被冻麻了。接下来，他掏出了一束硫黄火柴。但是，严寒此时已将他所有的手指都冻僵了。他竭力想把其中的一根火柴和其他的火柴分开，却把整整一束火柴掉在了雪地上。他试图捡起来，结果没有成功——冻僵的手指无法伸屈，也无法抓住物体。他的一举一动都谨小慎微，早已顾不上冰冷的脚、鼻头和脸颊，全部注意力均放在了火柴上。捡火柴时，他靠的是视觉而非触觉；当看见手指伸到了那束火柴的两边时，他便把它们合拢——其实，那仅是他的一种意愿，因为火柴虽近在眼前，手指却不听使唤。他又将手套戴回到了右手上，在膝盖上猛地拍打一番。接下来，他用两只戴着手套的手把那束火柴捧起，连带着许多雪，放在了膝头上。可是，情况并未有所改善。

费了九牛二虎之力，他总算用两只手掌的掌根再次捧起那束火柴，将其送至嘴边。接着，他一用劲张开嘴，只听见脸上结的冰咔嚓咔嚓地断裂开来。然后，他下颚内收，翘起上嘴唇，用上齿碰了一下那束火柴，想从中分离出一根来。结果，他大功告成，一根火柴落在了他的膝头。但事情却没有因此出现转机——他无法将这根火柴捡起来。这时他灵机一动，就用牙齿叼起火柴，在腿上划了划，划了有二十次才算划着了。随即，他用牙叼着燃烧的火柴去点那块桦树皮。可是燃烧的硫黄气钻入鼻孔和肺里，刺激得他一阵阵咳嗽。火柴则落到雪地上熄灭了。

一阵绝望的情绪袭来，他努力控制着这种情绪，心想那位硫黄湾的老江湖所说的话果然句句真实，零下五十度时出行，的确需要有个旅伴。他又用劲拍打手，而这次却没能产生任何感觉。突然，他不管三七二十一，用牙齿扯下手套，露出两手，将那束火柴夹在两个掌根之间——由于胳膊上的肌肉尚未冻伤，手掌根还能用得上劲。随后，他把那束火柴在大腿上划了一下。剌啦一声，火柴点燃了。七十根硫黄火柴全都点燃了！四处无风，不用担心火柴会被风吹灭。他把头偏向一边，避开令人窒息的硫黄味，用燃烧的火柴去点桦树皮。这时，他感到手上有烧灼的疼痛感。他手上的肉在燃烧，鼻子可以闻得到，内心深处也能感受得到。疼痛感在加剧，变成了撕心裂肺的痛。他咬牙忍受，笨拙地把燃烧的火柴凑近桦树皮，可是由于他的手也在燃烧，老碍事，把大部分火焰都吸掉了。桦树皮并没有轻易就点着。

最后，他疼得实在无法忍受，便猛地将两个掌根分开了。那束熊熊燃烧的火柴刺啦一声掉进了雪里，幸好桦树皮已被点着。他开始把干草和细枝添到火里。他不能用手去捡拾，只能用两个掌根夹取。枝条上沾着小块的腐木和绿苔，他就用牙齿尽量剔除掉。他小心翼翼地保护着火苗，动作很是笨拙。火意味着生命，万不能叫它熄灭。由于血液供不到体表，冷得他开始发抖，行动愈加困难。一大块绿苔掉下来，不偏不倚正好压在了小火堆上。他急忙用手指去捅，想把绿苔捅开，却因为浑身发抖，捅得过了头，捅乱了小火堆，结果使那些燃烧的干草和细枝散落一地。他试图再次把它们聚拢，并付出了巨大努力，然而由于全身抖得厉害，燃烧的枝条散而难聚。一根根枝条冒了一阵黑烟，末了全都熄灭了。这个生火的人彻底失败了。他漠然地看看周围，不经意把目光落在了狗的身上——那只狗卧在熄灭了的火堆的另一侧雪地上，不安地弓起身子，时而微微抬起一只前爪，然后又抬起另一只，身子来回蠕动，露出渴望和急切的神情。

一看见狗，他心里顿时起了一个疯狂的念头。他想起了一个传说，说的是一个人路遇暴风雪，于是杀死一头公牛，自己钻进牛的尸体里侥幸活了下来。他要把狗杀死，要将双手伸进狗那暖和的体内，直到麻木感消失，然后他就能再生一堆火了。主意拿定，他开始对狗说话，唤它到跟前来。可是，他的声音有点古怪，使狗觉得害怕，因为它以前从未听过主人以这种腔调说过话。这种情况有些蹊跷。它多疑的天性令它感到了危险，虽然并不知是什么危险，但它的内心却对主人生起了一种莫名的恐惧。听见主人的声音，它耳朵耷拉了下来，愈加焦虑不安地蠕动着身子，两只前爪一上一下倒换得更加厉害了，就是不肯到主人跟前去。他跪下身子，向狗爬去。这异常的姿势再次使狗起了疑心，它谨慎地躲开了。

他坐直身子，在雪地上坐了一会儿，努力想恢复平静。随后，他靠牙齿的帮助戴上手套，站了起来。他先朝脚下瞧瞧，看看自己是不是真的站了起来——他的双脚失去了知觉，似乎与地面两不相干。他的这种直立的姿势逐渐驱散了狗内心的疑虑。接着，他用专横的语气命令狗，啪啪啪地发出了狗鞭抽打的声音，唤醒了狗素有的忠诚，于是它走了过来。当它走到伸手可及的地方时，主人按捺不住，猛地伸开双臂扑了过去。这时他大吃一惊，发现自己的双手已无法抓住狗，手指不能弯曲也没有感觉。他一时竟忘了他的手已冻伤，而且伤情越来越严重。说时迟那时快，未等狗逃开，他将它死死锁在自己的怀里，搂住它不放，一屁股坐在了雪地上，而狗在一个劲地嗥叫、哀鸣和挣扎。

不过，他也只能将狗锁在怀里坐在雪地上，别无良策。他意识到自己是杀不死狗的，对此他只能干瞪眼空着急。他的两只手毫无用处，既不能拔出刀来将狗刺死，也无法掐死它。最后只好放它走了。狗儿噌的发疯似的跑了，夹着尾巴，嘴里尖声号叫着。它跑了有四十英尺远，停下来好奇地打量着他，两只耳朵直竖起来。而他低头望着自己的双手，想看看它们在什么地方，发现它们吊在胳膊的末端。他觉得这种现象真是奇怪——一个人竟然必须用眼睛观察，才知道自己的手在何处。他前后使劲甩胳膊，在身子的两侧狠狠拍打戴着手套的手。这套动作很剧烈，他做了有五分钟的样子，心脏总算把足够的血液输送到了体表，使他不再打哆嗦了。可是双手仍无知觉。他有一种模糊的感觉，觉得两只手就像重物一样悬挂在手臂末端，但当他试图驱散这种感觉时，他却无法再感知到了。

一种对死亡的畏惧感缓慢地朝他袭来。这种畏惧感很快变得非常强烈。他意识到这不仅仅是冻坏手指脚趾或失去手脚的问题了，而是生死攸关的问题，而他胜算不大。这叫他惊恐万分，于是他转身跑上河床，沿着那条古老、印迹模糊的小径飞奔。狗也跑了起来，寸步不离地跟着他。他茫无目的地瞎跑，一生中从来都没有如此害怕过。他深一脚浅一脚在雪地里狼狈前行，慢慢恢复了理智，看到了河岸、旧木堆、光秃的白杨和天空。奔跑使他感觉好了些，身上不再打哆嗦了。这么跑下去，或许他的脚也会解冻。假如能往远处跑，就能抵达营地跟伙计们会合。他无疑会失掉部分手指、脚趾，脸也会冻坏，但伙计们会照料他，把剩余的手指和脚趾保住。与此同时，他心里也产生了一种不祥的想法，认为根本别指望能到达营地跟伙计们会合了——路程太远，他又被冻伤了，伤情太严重，他很快就会被冻成冰棍，一命呜呼的。他把这种不祥的想法置之脑后，不去想它。有时它自己涌上前来，非要引起他的注意，而他又把它推回去，竭力去想别的事情。

让他感到奇怪的是，他的双脚已经完全冻麻，甚至连接触地面和承受身体的重量也察觉不到了，可就是这样一双脚竟然还能跑。他觉得自己好像在贴着地面飞行，好像并没有与地面接触。他曾在某个地方见过一幅带翅膀的墨丘利(7)的画，心想墨丘利贴着地面飞行时，大概就和他现在的感觉一样。

他一口气跑到营地跟伙计们会合的计划是有漏洞的，那就是他缺乏耐力。他跌跌绊绊、踉踉跄跄，最后，一个趔趄瘫倒在了地上。他竭力想爬起来，却失败了。他决定先坐着休息休息。等再次站起来时，他将缓步走，持续不断地朝前走。正当他坐着缓气时，突然感到暖洋洋的，十分舒服。他不再发抖了，甚至觉得有一股暖流涌到了胸口，涌遍了全身。然而，他触了触鼻子和脸颊，那儿一点感觉也没有。奔跑是不能让那儿解冻的，也不能让手脚解冻。这时，他想到自己身体被冻伤的部位会越来越多。他极力把这想法压下去，把它忘掉，极力去想别的事情。他觉得这种想法会造成恐慌，而他最怕的就是恐慌。可是，这想法老是冒出来，坚决不肯离去，最后导致他脑子里出现了一种幻觉，仿佛看见自己全身冻成了一个冰块。这叫他简直无法忍受，于是他又在小径上狂奔起来。他一度放慢脚步，可是一想到身体冻伤的部分在扩大，就又向前奔跑。

这段时间，狗一直寸步不离地跟着他。他第二次倒地时，它就在他前面卧下，卷起尾巴盖在前爪上，样子好奇、热切又关心。见它一副暖和安然的神情，他气得不得了，开口就骂，骂得它顺从地耷拉下了耳朵。此时，他浑身发抖，这次抖得更厉害了。他正在输掉这场跟严寒展开的斗争。严寒从四面八方袭来，钻进他的体内。他怕得再一次挣扎着前行，但没跑到一百英尺，就摇摇晃晃一头栽倒在地上。这是他最后一次产生恐慌感了。待喘过气，恢复平静后，他坐起来，心里出现了一个念头，想要不失尊严地迎接死亡。不过，这一念头并没有使他觉得有什么尊严，他倒觉得自己在冒傻气，就像一只头被剁掉还四处瞎跑的鸡——他心里想到的就是这种比喻。去他妈的，反正都是个死，还不如死得体面一些。他内心又获得了平静，随之而至的是一种昏昏欲睡的感觉。在睡梦中死去，这倒是一种很好的死法。这感觉就像是被麻醉了一般。看来，被冻死并不像人们想的那么糟。比这更糟的死法多着呢。

他想象着伙计们第二天发现他的尸体时的情景。突然，他胡思乱想起来，觉得自己跟那些人在一起顺着小径寻来，要找到他自己的尸体。他夹在那些人中间，拐了个弯，发现他自己躺在雪地上。他的灵魂已脱离躯体，仿佛变成了另外一个人，正和伙计们一起望着躺在雪地里的自己。他心想这鬼天气真是太冷了，回美国后，可以给人们讲一讲什么叫作真正的严寒。他神游他方，仿佛看到了硫黄湾的那个老江湖，而且看得清清楚楚，看见老江湖在暖暖和和、舒舒服服地抽烟袋。

“你说得很对，老人家，你说得很对。”他喃喃地对着硫黄湾的那个老江湖说。

他昏昏然睡着了，觉得这恐怕是他平生最舒服、最甜蜜的一觉了。狗卧在他面前，等着他睡醒。白昼很快过去，随即是漫长的黄昏。狗看不到有任何要生火的迹象。它从未见过一个人会一直坐在雪地里，连火也不生。暮色悄然降临，它渴望烤火，有些急不可耐，前爪一上一下动个不停，嘴里呜呜地轻声哀鸣，后来可能觉得会挨骂，耳朵耷拉了下来。可是，主人一声未吭。它提高了哀鸣声，最后爬到了主人跟前，嗅到了死亡的气息。顿时，它全身的毛竖起来，连连后退。它待了一会儿，冲着天空汪汪乱叫——此时的天上群星闪耀，一颗颗星星在发光、跳动。末了，它朝着自己所熟悉的营地的方向跑去，那儿会有别的主人为它提供食物和火。

黄金谷


此处是峡谷的绿色心脏，布局呆板的崖壁一到此处便豁然开朗，一改粗犷的格调，构成了一个封闭的小天地，每个角落都荡漾着甜蜜、丰实及柔情的气息。这儿的万物都在休养生息。连狭窄、汹涌的山涧也如被缰绳收住的野马，水流变得绵长起来，最后形成了一潭静静的清水。一只红色的公鹿低垂着它那多角的头，半闭着眼睛，站在齐膝深的水里打盹。

在水潭的一侧，也就是入水口的那个地方，有一小片草地，那凉爽、生命力旺盛的绿丛一直延伸到险峻的崖壁脚下。离水潭远一些的地方有一个土坡，坡度平缓，与对面的崖壁相连。坡上青草悠悠，花木繁茂，到处姹紫嫣红，一簇簇橘红色、绛紫色，还有金黄色的花。坡下的峡谷是个封闭的世界，外边是看不到的。两边的峭壁突然向一处靠拢，峡谷的尽头乱石嶙峋，青苔铺地，隐没于一片绿茵茵的藤葛、爬山虎和杂树之中。峡谷两旁层峦叠嶂，远处大山的山麓松林遍布。再往远处，清真寺尖塔般的山峰常年积雪，白皑皑的，宛若天边的白云，亮晃晃地反射着太阳的光辉。

峡谷里没有灰尘。树叶和花瓣洁净无瑕。青草似刚织成的天鹅绒一般。水潭边有三棵白杨树，在这静谧的空气中，树上的杨絮飘落，就像白白的绒毛。土坡上，带有酒香的石兰灌木的花朵使空气里充满春天的气息，而那经验丰富的叶片却开始垂直卷起，准备迎接即将来到的夏季干旱。在土坡空旷的地带，在石兰灌木未蔓延到的地方，百合花迎风摆动，就像许多暂作休息的彩蛾，颤抖着，时刻准备再次振翅高飞。斑斓闪烁的浆果鹃遍布四处，眼见它们的枝干就要由豆绿变成茜红，一大串一大串的花朵似蜡制的铃铛，散发着馥郁的芬芳。这种花呈乳白色，形似幽谷百合，芳香四溢，散发着春天的气息。

一丝风也没有，空气浓香醉人。如果空气凝重、潮湿，这种芳香可能会叫人觉得甜得发腻。不过，这儿的空气清爽、轻盈，犹如星光融入大气，浸透了阳光的温暖和花的芬芳。

偶尔会有一只蝴蝶飞来，穿梭于斑驳的光影之间。四周回响着山蜂那低沉的、令人昏昏欲睡的嗡嗡声——这些采花吮蜜的饕餮之徒，你推我搡地争先觅食，倒是一团和气，根本无暇诉诸武力。小溪涓涓流淌，蜿蜒穿过峡谷，静悄悄的，只偶尔发出轻微的汩汩声。这种水声很像一个人昏昏欲睡时的低语，困劲一上来就停了，困劲一过去就又提高了音量。

在这个峡谷的中心，一切都在轻盈地飘荡着。阳光和蝴蝶在树丛中飘进飘出。蜜蜂的嗡嗡声和小溪的低语也在飘动。飘来荡去的声音和色彩交织在一起，织出了一张细密、无形的网，而这就是主宰此处一切的精神。那是一种追求平静的精神，静而不死，蕴含着平稳搏动的生命，安静却不沉寂，活泼却不突兀。它并不激烈，没有争斗及艰辛，而是一份安恬，充满了勃勃生机。这儿的精神是和平生活的精神，沉湎于安逸，满足于眼前的繁荣，对于远方传来的战争谣言无动于衷。

那只多角的红色公鹿受到这种精神的支配，站在树荫遮蔽的没膝深的水里打盹。那儿甚至连只打搅它的苍蝇都没有。它显得懒洋洋的。有时，小溪一觉睡醒，发出几声低语，它会抖动抖动耳朵，但仍然懒洋洋的，因为它知道小溪可能是怀疑它睡着了，发发牢骚而已。

突然，这只公鹿竖起了耳朵，紧张起来，好像听到了什么声音，急切地要弄清那是什么声音。它转过头，面朝峡谷，翕动着灵敏的鼻子嗅着空气。它的目光无法穿透小溪贯穿其中的那道绿色屏障，但它的耳朵却听到了人的声音——那是一阵歌声，声音坚实、单调。接着，它又听到了金属碰击岩石发出的刺耳的声音。听见这声音，它突然一惊，打了个响鼻，纵身一跳，从水中跳到了草地上，站在天鹅绒一般的小草上，竖起耳朵，又嗅了嗅空气。接着，它静悄悄地走过这一小片草地，中途停了停，又侧耳听了听，随即便从峡谷里消失了，像个幽灵一样，脚步轻盈，一点声音都没有。

钉着铁掌的鞋跟碰击岩石发出的刺耳的声音又响了起来。那个人的声音变得越来越大。那是一首颂歌，由于渐渐接近，声音愈加清晰，连歌词也能听得清了：

回过头来，转过你的脸，

看一看那美轮美奂的小山，

（罪恶，罪恶，叫人轻看！）

瞧瞧周围，把周围看一看，

快将罪恶的包袱抛到一边。

（说不定今晨就会遇见上帝！）

伴随歌声传来的是踢踏踢踏爬山的声音。随着红色公鹿的悄然消失，峡谷里宁静的气氛也荡然无存了。那道绿色的屏障突然被破开，一个人探出头来，瞧了瞧这儿的草地、水潭和斜坡。他属于那种从容不迫的人。只见他打量一眼四周的环境，然后细细察看一草一木，看看和自己最初的印象是否相符。到了最后——也就是把一切都看清楚之后，他才开了口，用生动的语言由衷赞叹道：

“好一个洞天福地，真是人间仙境！看看这山山水水、花花草草，真是美不胜收！这简直是淘金者的乐园！卡尤塞人(1)的天堂！眼睛累了，这凉爽的绿色可以缓解疲劳！这儿用不上那种包治百病的粉红色药丸(2)，完全是一片秘密的绿洲，专为淘金者而设，让他们疲倦的双脚得到休息。真他妈的棒！”

他沙色皮肤，一脸和气和幽默——这两点是他脸上最明显的特征。这张脸表情丰富，随着心情和思绪迅速发生改变。因而，他在想什么便一目了然。由于心潮起伏，他脸上也潮水涌动，犹如一阵阵风掠过湖面。他的头发稀稀拉拉，乱蓬蓬的，发色跟肤色相仿，都淡得说不准是什么颜色。只有他的眼睛蓝得惊人，仿佛他身上所有的颜色都注入了这双眼睛。这双眼睛笑吟吟的，充满了快乐，颇有几分孩童的天真和好奇在里面，而同时，这双眼睛里还隐约透露出一种靠人生阅历磨炼出来的沉着自信和刚强坚毅。

从藤葛和爬山虎构成的那道绿色屏障后边，他先将一把矿工用的锄头、一把铲子和一个淘金盘扔了出来，然后自己也跟着爬出，来到了这片空地上。他下身穿着一条褪色的工装裤，上身套着一件黑布衬衫，脚上蹬着一双钉着平头钉的皮靴，头戴一顶不成样子的脏帽子，一看就知道它历经风吹雨打、日晒烟熏。他直直地站在那里，睁大眼睛看着这片与世隔绝的天地，鼻翼愉悦地翕动着，尽情呼吸着峡谷乐园里馨香的空气。他的眼睛笑得眯成了一条蓝色的缝，脸上乐开了花，咧着嘴在笑。只听他大声喊道：

“看这随风摇曳的蒲公英和快乐的蜀葵，真是芳香扑鼻！说什么玫瑰香油和科隆香水，和这里的花香一比，可就太逊色了！”

他有个自言自语的习惯。尽管他面部表情变化很快，能够反映出内里的心情和思绪，但他的舌头还是不甘落后，总是要把他的心情和思绪再复述一遍，就像博斯威尔(3)再世。

他趴在水潭的入水口处开始痛饮，一口接一口，饮了很长时间。“味道真好！”他喃喃赞叹道，一边抬起头，目光掠过水面望着山坡，一边用手背抹了抹嘴。谁知山坡引起了他的注意。他仍趴在那儿，仔细地研究了很久山的结构。他那经验丰富的眼睛将目光从山坡移向岩块剥落的崖壁，再转回来，移到水潭边。随后，他爬起身，把山坡又观察了一遍。

“这地方看起来不错。”他末了说了一句，随手拎起了他的锄头、铲子和淘金盘。

他走到水潭的下边，踩着一块块石头轻巧地跨过小溪，然后在靠近水边的山坡上挖了一铲土放到淘金盘里。随即，他蹲下身子，双手捧着盘子，将盘子的一半浸入溪水中，接下来就灵巧地来回转动它，让水流进泥沙，再流出去。比较大、比较轻的砂土粒浮到了上面来，他熟练地将盘子一歪，就把这些砂土粒漂出去了。有时，为了加快速度，他就把盘子放稳，用手拣出大石子和碎石。

盘子里的东西减少得很快，后来只剩下了细泥和极小的砂粒。到了这一步，他就淘得非常细腻和精心了。这是细淘。他越淘越细致，用眼睛仔细观察，用手细之又细、一丝不苟地挑拣。末了，盘子里似乎只剩下了水，别无其他。不过，他敏捷地把盘子转了半圈，让盘子里的水从浅浅的边沿流入小溪里，然后就发现盘底有一层黑砂。这是薄薄的一层黑砂，薄得像黑颜料留下的一丝痕迹。他凑近细心一看，发现里面含有一粒小小的金砂。他把盘子的边向下一压，让一点溪水流进来，又猛地一晃，使水冲刷盘底，把那些黑砂粒冲来冲去的。总算没有白费力气，他又发现了一粒小小的金砂。

此时的淘砂精益求精，其精细程度已完全超过了寻常的淘砂程序。他一点一点地把黑砂漂到盘子的浅边外面。每漂一次，他都要把黑砂一粒粒逐个检查一遍，然后才让其漂出去。他睁圆双眼，让这些黑砂一点一点地滑出去。突然，盘子边上出现了一粒只有针尖大的金砂。他让水倒流，那粒金砂也回到了盘底。以这样的方式，他又发现了一粒，接着又是一粒。他谨小慎微地看顾着这些金砂，宛若牧羊人放牧羊群，不让任何一粒流失。最后，一盘子的泥土都让水冲走了，只剩下了几粒金砂。他数了数，然后一扬手，竟然把盘子里他辛苦了半天淘出的金砂连同最后的一点水全泼掉了。

不过，他站起身时，一双蓝眼睛却熠熠闪光，里面充满了欲望。“七粒。”他出声咕哝道，念叨了一遍他千辛万苦淘出来，却又随手丢掉的金砂粒的数目。“七粒。”他又念叨了一遍，语气凝重，仿佛要将这个数目留在记忆里。

他静静地在那儿站了很久，观望着那片山坡，目光好奇、热烈。他异常兴奋，就像是一只猎犬敏锐地嗅到了猎物的气味。

他沿着小溪向下游走了几步，又铲了一盘泥土。

又是一番细淘，他谨小慎微地收集着淘出来的金砂，数过之后又全都泼进了溪水里。

“五粒。”他咕哝道，随后又重复了一遍。

他不由得又观察了几眼小山，沿着小溪向下游再走几步，又铲了一盘土。就这样，他不断淘着金砂，金砂的数量在持续减少。“四粒，三粒，两粒，两粒，一粒。”——他向下游走着，脑子里列出了一张金砂数目表。后来，一盘土只淘得出一粒金砂了，这时他便停下来，用干树枝生起一堆火。接着，他把淘金盘放进火里烧，直至将其烧成蓝黑色。之后，他拿起盘子，很挑剔地检查了一遍，才满意地点了点头。这种底色的盘子，里面哪怕有再小的黄点也逃不过他的眼睛。

他继续向小溪的下游走了几步，又淘了一盘，结果仅淘到一粒金砂。第三盘竟一无所获。他没有因此而止步，每隔一英尺，便挖上几铲土，又连着淘了三盘。结果盘盘皆空。这没有叫他气馁，反而让他感到高兴。他越是淘不着，就越喜悦盈怀，最后只见他站起身来，喜不自胜地大叫一声：

“要是在这里挖不到金子，就让上帝用酸苹果砸掉我的脑袋好啦！”

他回到出发点，向着小溪的上游开始一盘盘地淘。最初，金砂的数量在增加，增加得很快。“十四粒，十八粒，二十一粒，二十六粒。”——他在脑子里又列出了一张金砂数目表。在水潭的上边，他的收获达到了鼎盛，一盘淘出了二十五粒金砂。

“这么多，丢掉真可惜。”他一边让水把金砂冲走，一边惋惜地说。

太阳已经升到了天空的最高处，他仍在苦干不休。他逆流而上，一盘一盘地淘着，淘出的金砂数量在持续减少。

“太棒啦，越来越少了！”当一盘土只淘出一粒金砂时，他兴高采烈地叫道。后来，一连几盘，颗粒无收，他便直起腰，满怀信心地向山坡上望了一眼。

“哈哈！黄金先生！”他大声叫喊道，就好像在对藏在山坡上的什么人讲话似的，“哈哈！黄金先生！我来啦！我来啦！我一定会抓住你的！你听见了没有，黄金先生？我一定会抓住你的，就像老鹰抓小鸡一样！”

他转身来，抬头望了一眼那万里无云的蓝天上高悬着的太阳，然后顺着刚才淘金时挖出来的那些土坑信步走去。走到水潭的下边，他跨过小溪，钻到那道绿色屏障后面不见了。此时，若想恢复这个地方原来的那种宁静、安闲的气氛已经不太可能——他大着嗓门在唱拉格泰姆风格的曲子，仍然让歌声主宰着整个峡谷。

过了一会儿，他又回来了，铁钉鞋踏在石头上咯噔咯噔响，声音比上一次还要大。那道绿色屏障激烈地晃动起来，哗啦哗啦地来回摇摆着。丁零哐啷，一阵金属的摩擦碰撞。他的声音传来，调门更高了，换上了一种严厉呵斥的口气。似有一个庞然大物冲过来，呼哧呼哧喘着粗气。只听一阵噼里啪啦的树枝断裂声，但见树叶纷纷落地，随即有一匹马从绿色屏障后冲了出来。它驮着一个行李包，包袱上挂着一条条被扯断的藤蔓和爬山虎。这只动物见自己置身于如此一番景色之中，不由得惊讶万分，四处张望，之后便垂下头来，心满意足地吃起了草。接着，又有一匹马跌跌撞撞地冲了过来，踩在布满青苔的石头上蹄下一打滑，后来落到松软的草地上才稳住了身体。它背上有一副高鞍头的墨西哥式马鞍，由于用久了，已经褪色，破破烂烂的，马背上没有人。

他跟在最后边，立稳脚跟，卸下行李和马鞍，看好了露宿的地方，随即解开缰绳，放两匹马去吃草。接着，他解开粮袋，拿出一个平底锅和一个咖啡壶，拾来一抱干柴，用几块石头垒了一个生火的地方。

“哎哟哟！”他叫了一声，“我肚子饿极啦，简直能吞下一头牛。给我两个人的饭，我也照样吃得下去。”

他直起腰，将手伸进工装裤的口袋里取火柴，同时目光越过水潭投向那个山坡。他已经抓到了火柴盒，可是指头一松，把空手抽了出来。他明显有些犹豫不决，瞧瞧准备好了的烹调食物，再瞧瞧那个山坡。

“看来我得杀个回马枪，再去瞧瞧。”他末了说道，迈出步子准备跨过小溪。

“这么做没有什么道理，”他辩解似的咕哝道，“但也不过就是晚一个小时吃饭，饿不死的。”

在距离第一次铲土淘金起点处几英尺的地方，他又开辟了第二条淘金路线。日落西山，投下的影子变长了，而他仍在不停地干着。后来，他又开辟了第三条路线，继续淘着。这样，顺着山坡而上，他横向辟出了一条又一条的淘金路线，每条线的中点淘出的金砂最多，而两端却一无所获。越是往上走，这些线就越短。淘金线在不断缩短，形成了一种规律——以此看来，当线短得不能再短时，到头来便会聚成一个点。这种排列构成一个倒写的“V”字。这个“V”字向里收缩的两边，就是金砂分布的边界。

显而易见，他的目的是找到这个“V”字的顶点。他时不时会瞄一眼“V”字的两条斜边，再望望坡上，竭力想确定那个顶点的方位——那儿就是金砂的尽头。在那里，居住着“黄金先生”（他总是这样亲热地称呼坡上那个想象中的掘金点）。他大声吆喝着：

“快出来吧，黄金先生！还是识相点，乖乖给我出来吧！”

“那好吧，”他补充了一句，语气显得很坚定，接着就信誓旦旦地威胁道，“咱就骑驴看唱本，走着瞧。我早晚都会找到你，把你这个缩头乌龟揪出来。不把你揪出来，就不是英雄好汉！”

每铲一盘土，他都要端到小溪边淘洗。越往坡顶走，盘子里淘出来的金砂就越多。后来，他舍不得扔了，便将金砂收集起来，装在他原来随随便便塞在裤子后袋里的一个装发酵粉的空铁罐里。他只顾埋头苦干，没注意到夜幕已在慢慢降临。直到怎么也辨别不出盘底的金砂了，他才意识到时间已过去了很久。他猛地直起腰来，脸上显出一副诧异和惊讶的表情，带着拖腔说：

“真是活见鬼，我把午饭都忘记吃了！”

他深一脚浅一脚地摸黑跨过小溪，将耽搁已久的火生着。这顿晚饭吃的是薄煎饼、咸肉和热过的熟豆子。饭后，他守着半明半暗的木炭抽了一袋烟，听着夜间的窸窣声，望了一会儿峡谷里如水般的月光。之后，他打开铺盖卷，脱下笨重的皮鞋，把毯子拉到了下巴底下。月光下，他的脸惨白惨白的，宛如死尸一般。不过，这是一具魂魄未散的死尸——他突然用胳臂肘撑起身子，望了望对面的山坡。

“晚安，黄金先生，”他睡意蒙眬地说道，“晚安。”

次日，灰蒙蒙的晨曦垂降，太阳升起，阳光直射到他的眼皮上。他这才突然惊醒过来，瞧瞧四周，记起了自己为何身处此地，把眼前的现实与昨天发生的事情联系在了一起。

至于起床穿衣，其实他只需要系好鞋带就行。他望一眼火堆，再望一眼山坡，有点举棋不定，最后他终于战胜了诱惑，将火生着。

“悠着点，悠着点，比尔，别着急，”他告诫着自己，“瞎着急有什么用？除了累一身臭汗，什么用也不顶。黄金先生在等着你呢。在你吃完早饭之前，他不会跑掉的。当务之急，比尔，是先吃点新鲜的东西，然后再去找他算账也不迟。”

他到水潭边砍了短短一截树枝，从口袋里掏出一段钓丝和一个用旧的高档湿毛钩(4)。

“一大早，鱼儿可能容易上钩。”他甩出第一竿，把鱼钩甩进水潭里，嘴中喃喃自语道。过了一小会儿，只听他大叫一声：“看看，我说得不错吧？我说得不错吧？”

他没有卷线的轮盘，也不愿在这上面浪费时间，而是单凭自身的力气，麻利地从水里拉出了一条银光闪闪、长达十英寸的鳟鱼。接下来，他又很快地一连钓起了三条，充作早餐。然后，他走到踏脚石跟前，准备穿过小溪到山坡上去。就在这时，他突然想起了什么，于是停下了脚步。

“最好先到小溪下游走一趟，”他说，“说不定有谁藏在附近窥探呢。”

不过，他还是踩着石头跨过了小溪。接着，他说了一句“我真该去走一趟呀”，随即便将一切都抛到脑后，开始干起了活。

夜色降临时，他挺起了身子。由于老弓着背干活，他觉得后腰都累僵了，于是伸手去按摩后腰上酸痛的肌肉，嘴里说道：

“现在你想想，这到底是怎么啦？瞧我又把午饭忘了个干干净净！要是再不注意，我准会变成一个一天只吃两顿饭的怪人的。”

当天夜里，他钻进毯子里睡觉时，自言自语地说：“黄金真是迷魂药，叫人心神不定的。”不过，入睡前，他还是没忘记冲着山坡喊一声：“晚安，黄金先生！晚安！”

日出时，他便起床匆匆吃了些早点，早早地就开始干起了活。有一种狂热好像正在他体内滋生，淘到的金砂越来越多，他的狂热越高涨不退。他的脸上红通通的，不同于被太阳晒出的那种红。他不知道疲倦，忘记了时间的流逝。每当装满一盘土，他就跑到山下去淘洗，然后又气喘吁吁，一摇一晃地跑上山去，重新把淘金盘装满。

现在，他淘到了离水边一百码的地方。那个倒写的“V”字正在按照一定的比例缩小，可淘金的地面宽度在一点点变窄。他在心里估摸了一下这个“V”字的两条边在山坡上的交汇点。“V”字的交汇点正是他要找的目标，为了确定它的位置，他不知淘了多少盘土和金砂。

“交汇点应该就在那丛石兰灌木上方大概两码左右，向右偏一码的地方。”他最终得出了结论说。

接着，他经不住诱惑，说了句“这是明摆着的，简直跟和尚头上的虱子一样”，便放下手中的活，不再辛苦地按路线淘金了，索性直接爬到了自己估计出来的交汇点。他在那儿铲了一盘土，端到山下淘洗，没有发现金砂的踪影。他深挖浅挖，又淘了十几盘，连一粒最微小的金砂也没有找到。他气极了，怪自己不该那般经不住诱惑，狠狠地责备了一番自己的不虔诚和自以为是。随后，他走下山坡，又开始按路线挖土淘洗。

“心急吃不了热豆腐，比尔，悠着点，”他轻声告诫着自己，“干这一行，急于求成是不行的。你也该明白了。放聪明些，比尔，放聪明些。慢慢地一步一步来，只有这样才能奏效。坚持干下去，水到渠自成。”

横线在缩短，“V”字的两边越来越靠拢了，可是深度也在增加。矿脉钻到山体里去了。现在只有深挖三十英寸，才能淘到金砂。有时无论是挖二十五英寸，还是挖三十五英寸，他都淘不到金砂。在“V”字的底部，靠近水潭的地方，他在草根附近发现了一些金砂。越往坡上走，金砂就埋得越深。后来，为了能淘一盘含金砂的土，就得挖一个三英尺深的坑，这可不是闹着玩的。而在他和那个顶点之间，还需要挖无数个这样的坑。“鬼知道还要挖多深。”他停下来喘气时，发出了这么一声叹息，用手揉了揉酸痛的后背。

欲望在燃烧，他不顾后背酸痛和肌肉僵硬，挥动着锄头和铲子不停地挖那松软的褐色泥土，沿着山坡向上掘进。他面前是一片平展的草坡，草坡上繁花似锦，芳香扑鼻，而他身后却是一片狼藉。山坡原本平滑的皮肤，现在坑坑洼洼，像是起了红斑狼疮。他的进度很慢，就像是一条蛞蝓爬过后留下的一路令人恶心的脏污，破坏了美丽的环境。

坑越挖越深，工作量越来越大，但淘到的金子也越来越多，这对他是一种安慰。他估算着每盘金砂的价值——二十美分，三十美分，五十美分，乃至六十美分……夜幕降临时，他一铲子下去，挖出来的土竟然淘出了价值一美元的金砂。

“怕就怕遇见倒霉的事，有哪个居心叵测的家伙闯到我的这片乐土来捣乱。”夜里睡觉时，他把毯子拉到下巴跟前，睡眼蒙眬地咕哝了一句。

突然，他一个鲤鱼打挺坐起身，厉声警告自己：“比尔！你给我听好啦，比尔！竖起耳朵听着！明天一早，你一定要到周围走走，看看有什么情况。明白吗？明天早晨你可别忘了！”

他打了个呵欠，望着对面的山坡，高喊了一声：“晚安，黄金先生！”

次日晨，他比太阳起得还早。当第一缕阳光照到他身上时，他已吃完了早餐，正沿着峡谷的崖壁攀爬（由于坍塌，崖壁上有了踏脚的地方）。到了崖顶，放眼望去，他发现周围渺无人迹，只看得到一重重的山，连绵起伏。他向东望去，目光越过群山峻岭，远隔许多英里可以看见一排远山，山巅白雪皑皑——那是主峰，西部世界高可触天的脊梁。向北面和南面眺望，则可以比较清楚地看到那些纵横交错的山脉融入到了这条峰峦似海的主要山脉里。西面的山头一个接着一个渐变矮小，逐一变成平缓的山丘，最终形成在他视野之外的平坦谷地。

在如此辽阔的区域内，他没有看到一个人影，也没看到人类留下的痕迹——除了他脚下千疮百孔的山坡。他久久眺望，细心观察。他曾以为自己看到了脚下的这条峡谷里飘出的一缕淡淡的青烟。他又看了看，最后断定那是山间的紫色烟岚，崖壁环绕，便因此显现出更暗淡的颜色。

“嘿，听着，黄金先生！”他冲着脚下的峡谷喊道，“快给我老老实实滚出来！我来啦，黄金先生！我来啦！”

他脚上穿的皮鞋很沉，使他走起路显得有些笨拙，可是他从那高得叫人头发晕的崖顶下来的时候却轻快、灵巧得像只山羊。崖壁边上有一块石头在他脚下松动，不过他一点也没有惊慌。他好像很清楚落石要经过多长时间才会导致灾难。在这千钧一发之际，他利用落石暂时垫脚，以图借助它抵达安全之地。即使有的地方坡度太陡，无法立足，他不会有丝毫的犹豫。哪怕有一丁点可以落脚的地方，哪怕只能站一秒钟，他也会用脚点一下，然后借势向前跳去。而且，有时就连站一站的地方也没有，他便用手抓住崖壁上的一块突出的岩石，一条山缝，或者一丛根基不牢的灌木，纵身荡过去。最后，他猛力一跳，大吼一声，跳离了崖壁，随着几吨重的泥土和碎石一起落到了地面。

这天早晨，他淘第一盘就淘出了价值两美元多的粗金——这盘土取自“V”字的中心。由此向两面淘过去，含金量迅速下滑。此时，他所掘的横线已经变得非常短了。这个倒写的“V”字的两条边，中间相隔只有几码远了，它们的交点已近在咫尺。可是，需要越挖越深才有金砂。中午刚过，他挖掘时发现必须挖到五英尺深才能挖到它们。

据此看来，金矿已不再是虚无的迹象，而是实实在在的现实了。这是一个名副其实的金矿。他决定先去找到矿穴，然后再回来这儿继续挖。不过，淘出来的金砂数量越来越多，这叫他颇感困惑。傍晚时分，他每一盘能淘到价值三至四美元的金砂。他困窘地挠挠头，望望坡上几英尺远的石兰灌木丛（他估计那儿是“V”字的顶点）。只见他点点头，像宣布神谕一样说道：“二者必居其一，比尔，二者必居其一。要么，黄金如天女散花，被撒在这山坡上，要么就是金子多得不得了，叫你搬都搬不完。搬不走，那岂不可惜，你说是不是？”想到这叫人高兴的困境，他哑然失笑。

夜幕降临时，他仍在小溪边淘金，眼睛在越来越浓的黑暗中费力地看着淘金盘，为了能淘出价值五美元的金砂奋斗着。

“真希望有一盏电灯，让我继续干下去。”他说。

这天夜里，他辗转反侧，多次努力稳定情绪，闭上眼睛，希望能够睡着，可是强烈的欲望令他热血沸腾，使他一再睁开眼睛，带着倦意喃喃自语：“要是太阳出来就好了。”

最后，他终于睡着了，但星光刚刚暗淡下来，他就又把眼睛睁开了。天刚亮，他就已经吃完早饭，爬上山坡，向黄金先生的隐身之处走去了。

他开辟的第一条横线，只够挖三个坑。此时，含金砂的矿脉已经变得很窄了，他找了四天的金矿点几乎近在跟在。

“沉住气，比尔，悠着点。”他不断对自己说着，同时动手在“V”字两边的交汇点挖着最后的一个坑。

“我已经牢牢抓住了你，黄金先生，想跑是跑不掉的。”坑越挖越深，他不知把这话说了有多少遍。

四英尺，五英尺，六英尺，他不停地向地底下挖着。挖掘的难度在不断增加。哐当一声，他的锄头触着了断岩。他停下来观察了一下。

“是蚀烂了的石英！”他末了做出结论说。他用铲子清理掉坑底的松土，然后用锄头敲打松脆的石英，每敲一下，这块正在崩裂的石头上就有一些碎块掉下来。他把铲子插到松散的碎石里。突然，眼前金光一闪。他扔开手中的铲子，蹲下身子，用双手捧起一块快要解体的石英，抹掉上面的土，就像一个庄稼人刚挖出土豆后拭去上面的泥土一样。

“沙达纳帕里斯(5)也没有这么好的运气！”他大喊道，“是金块啊！是金块啊！”

他手里捧着的，一半是石头，另一半完全是纯金。他把它放在淘金盘里，又拿起一块检查了一下。起初，一点黄颜色也看不到，但他用有力的指头把松脆的石英剥掉之后，发现两只手里全是亮闪闪的黄金。他一块一块地擦掉它们面上的泥土，然后把它们扔到淘金盘里。这儿简直就是一个宝库。石英多已蚀烂，所剩无几，还没有金子多。他时不时会找到一块纯金——真正的纯金，上面一点杂质都没有。有一块含金石，他用锄头从正中敲开，里面金光闪闪，就像是一把璀璨的金黄色的珠宝。他歪着脑袋瞧着它，慢慢地旋转它，欣赏着它那夺目的光彩。

“还说你们挖的金子多，吹你们的牛吧！”他轻蔑地哼了哼鼻子说，“要跟这儿比，你们那一点连狗屁都算不上。这儿遍地是黄金。我要给这条峡谷起个名字，叫它‘黄金谷’！”

说话间，他仍蹲着身子逐个检查那些碎块，然后把它们一一扔到淘金盘里。蓦地，一种危险的预感袭上心来，使他觉得好像有一道影子扑了过来。可是他看看周围，并没有什么影子。他的心像是跳到了嗓子眼，堵得他透不过气来。他觉得周身的血慢慢变冷了，衬衫也已被冷汗湿透，紧紧贴在了肉上。

他既没有跳起来，也没有东张西望。他纹丝不动，仔细分析着这到底是什么样的预感。他觉得有一种神秘的力量对他敲响了警钟，于是竭力想弄清那力量来自于何方；他感到有一种看不见的东西在威胁着他，千方百计想分辨清那究竟是何物。

有时候，一个人会感觉到一种敌对的气息，只是那种感觉朦朦胧胧，看不见也摸不着。此时，他感觉到了这种气息，却说不清自己是怎么感觉到的。他只知道这种感觉就像乌云遮住了太阳，觉得有样阴森森的东西在威胁着他的生命，令他窒息，仿佛有一片阴影罩住了他，在吞噬他，要剥夺他的性命。

他身上的每一个细胞都在命令他跳起来去对付那看不见的危险，不过，他的理智控制住了他的恐慌。他蹲着没动，手里捧着一块金子。他不敢回头看，但他知道有什么就在他的身后，就在土坑的外边。他假装对手里的金子兴致盎然，用鉴别的目光左看右看，反过来倒过去，将上面的泥土全都擦掉。在这段时间里，他知道，有个人正在他的肩膀后面，将目光投射向这块金子。

他假装欣赏着手里的金子，耳朵却注意倾听着，听见身后有呼吸声。他的目光在眼前的地面搜索，想找件武器，然而只看到了挖出来的金子，而那东西在这危急时刻是派不上用场的。锄头也在跟前，只是目前的状况也是用不上的。他意识到了自己身处的困境——他在一个七英尺深的坑里，地方狭窄，看不到地面，犹如在陷阱里一般。

他依旧蹲着不动，内心却一丝不乱，异常冷静。他权衡了一切因素，可想来想去，仍无良策。他把石英碎块逐一捡起，挨个擦去上面的泥土，将露出来的金子扔到盘子里。他实在想不出办法来。但他很清楚，自己早晚都必须站起来，面对身后的危险。就这样，几分钟过去了。每一分钟他都在想着事情已迫在眉睫——他必须站起来，要么……想到这里，被冷汗湿透的衬衫在身上贴得更紧了……要么他将守着他的宝贝迎接死亡。

他仍然蹲着，一面擦掉金块上的泥土，一面权衡利弊，考虑着该怎样站起来才好——要么一跃而起，三下两下爬到坑外，在那儿的平地上跟那个威胁着他的家伙较量较量；要么就慢慢地、随意地站起来，装出一副不经意看见身后那家伙的样子。他的本能和全身每一个渴望战斗的细胞都赞成孤注一掷，冲出去拼个你死我活。然而他的理智和心计却赞成用缓兵之计，去谨慎地面对那个威胁着他的人。就在举棋不定的时候，他听见了啪的一声巨响，同时感到后背的左侧受到重重一击，那一击似一团火刺透了他的身体。他纵身一跳，但没跳多高便跌落在了地上。他身体蜷缩着，犹如树叶遇火缩成了一团，胸口压在淘金盘上，脸埋在泥土和碎石里，两条腿在狭窄的坑底扭在一起，一阵阵地抽搐着。接着，他全身抖如筛糠，似疟疾症发作一般。之后，一声长长的叹息之后，他慢慢吸了口气，慢慢地，他缓缓将这口气吐出，身体渐渐瘫软，最后一动也不动了。

坑外那家伙手里拿着左轮手枪，站在坑沿朝下张望着，把坑底的这个趴着不动的躯体打量了许久。过了一会儿，那个不速之客在坑沿坐下，这样便于观察坑内的情况，然后把手枪放在膝盖上，伸手进衣袋，掏出一小片棕褐色的纸，放一些烟丝在上边，用手一卷，再将两头一塞，做成了一支棕褐色的又短又粗的卷烟。他的眼睛始终盯着坑底的那个人，一刻也没离开过。他点着烟，徐徐抽了一口，把烟吸进肺里，慢腾腾地吞云吐雾。抽着抽着烟灭了，他又重新点着。他一边抽烟，一边观察着脚下的那个人。

最后，他把烟蒂扔掉，站了起来。他移步靠近坑沿，两脚踏在土坑壁上，双手撑在两侧（右手仍握着枪），身体一点一点往下移。脚离坑底有一码远的时候，他一松手，跳了下去。

他的脚刚一沾地，坑底的那个淘金人便闪电般地出手，抓住他的两条腿将他掀翻在地。刚才向下跳的时候，他那只握枪的手举过头顶，而就在自己的腿被抓住的那一瞬间，他立马把枪口转向了坑底。身体还在半空中，双脚尚未落地时，他扣动了扳机。在这狭小的空间，枪声震耳欲聋。坑里硝烟弥漫，弄得他什么也看不见。他仰面摔倒在地，那个淘金人猛虎般扑在了他身上。尽管被淘金人压着，这位不速之客仍将右胳膊一弯，准备再开一枪。淘金人飞快地用胳膊肘撞了一下他的手腕，枪口被撞得向上一翘，子弹射进了坑壁的泥土里。

紧接着，不速之客感到淘金人牢牢地抓住了他的手腕。二人激烈搏斗，开始夺枪，都想将枪口指向对方。此时，坑里的硝烟在渐渐消散。不速之客仰面躺在地上，可以模糊地看见一点东西了。可是，他的对手突然故意对准他的眼睛撒了一把土，他又什么也看不见了。他猛然一惊，不由松开了抓枪的手。随即，他感到脑子里突然一片漆黑，紧接着，就连那片漆黑也消失了。

淘金人朝着他开了一枪又一枪，直到将子弹打空。随后，他把枪扔掉，气喘吁吁地一屁股坐在了死人的腿上。

他抽泣了几声，几乎有点透不过气来了。“狗日的，鼠辈！”他喘着粗气骂道，“竟然偷偷跟着我，等我找到了金子，就在我背后开冷枪！”

他又气又累，说话都带着哭腔。他低头看了看死者的脸，见他脸上撒满泥土和碎石，难以看得清五官。

“从未见过这家伙，”他在仔细瞧过之后说，“只不过是个小贼！死去吧！竟然在我背后开冷枪！竟然在我背后开冷枪！”

他解开自己的衬衫，摸摸左面的胸部和背部。

“子弹打穿了，但不碍事！”他高兴地高声说，“我敢打赌，他瞄得倒是挺准的，可就在他转过枪口，扣动扳机之际——啪，让他射偏了！结果，我把他给收拾了！哼，叫他栽在了我手里！”

他用手指摸了摸身上的弹孔，脸上划过一丝遗憾的神情。“这伤口要疼起来了，”他说道，“我得赶快包扎好伤口，赶紧离开这儿。”

他爬出土坑，到了山坡下的宿营地。半小时之后，他又回来了，把驮行李的马也牵了来。他的衬衣敞着，露出了包扎伤口的绷带。他的左手动作缓慢、笨拙，但这并不妨碍他使用左边的胳臂。

他将行李绳捆在死者的腋下，将尸体拖出了土坑，然后开始挖金子。他挖啊挖，一连挖了几个小时，肩膀酸了就休息休息，休息时会骂上一句：“狗日的不是个东西，竟然在我背后开冷枪！竟然在我背后开冷枪！”

他将坑里的金子悉数挖出，用毯子裹起来，打成了几个包，然后估计了一下价值。

“要没有四百磅，那我就是个霍屯督人(6)，”他末了说道，“就算里面含两百磅的石英和泥土，纯金也有两百磅。比尔！醒醒吧！两百磅金子呀！四万美元呢！全都属于你，全是你一个人的！”

他喜上眉梢，高兴得直挠头，手指无意中摸到了一个以前没发现的头上的槽沟，有几英寸长，是另一颗子弹犁出的，贴着头皮擦过。

他怒不可遏，大步向死者走去。

“你还冲我下毒手！”他咆哮道，“想跟我较量，是不是？哼，我倒把你给收拾了。不仅如此，我还要给你一个体面的葬礼呢。也算对得起你了。”

他把尸体拖到坑沿，将其推了下去。尸体嗵的一声砸在了坑底，侧着身子，面部扭过来朝着亮光。淘金人居高临下望着死者。

“谁叫你在别人的背后放冷枪！”他斥责道。

他挥动锄头和铲子，用土把坑填平，然后把金子放到马背上。金子太重，让这匹驮行李的马有点吃不消。一到宿营地，他把一部分金子转移到了他的坐骑背上。即便如此，他还得被迫丢掉一部分装备——锄头、铲子、淘金盘、多余的粮食和炊具，另还有其他一些七零八碎的东西。

太阳已经升到了头顶，他赶着马儿走向那道由藤蔓和爬山虎构成的屏障。在攀登巨大的岩石时，马儿几乎直立了起来，不顾一切地闯进了盘根错节的树丛里。那匹带鞍子的坐骑一度重重摔倒在地，他便拿开金子包囊，帮它站起来。待马儿重新上路后，他把头伸出树丛，最后看了一眼那面山坡。

“别了，卑鄙的小人！”他说完就不见了。

接着就是窸窸窣窣、咔嚓咔嚓一阵拉扯藤葛和折断树枝的声音。马儿穿过树丛，使得小树前后乱摇。钉着铁掌的马蹄踏在石头上发出嗒嗒嗒的声音，时不时还响起他高嗓门的呵斥声。后来，他大声唱起了歌：

回过头来，转过你的脸，

看一看那美轮美奂的小山，

（罪恶，罪恶，叫人轻看！）

瞧瞧周围，把周围看一看，

快将罪恶的包袱抛到一边。

（说不定今晨就会遇见上帝！）

歌声越来越小，最后归于沉寂，峡谷又恢复了原来的宁静。小溪又开始打盹和低声细语；山蜂那令人昏昏欲睡的嗡嗡声又响了起来；白杨树的花絮如白白的绒毛在香气四溢的空气里飘荡；蝴蝶在树丛里翻飞；明媚的阳光洒在一草一木之上。只有从草地上的马蹄印和那面被挖得坑坑洼洼的山坡能看出：这儿宁静曾经一度被扰攘喧嚣的过客所打破，而现在他们已经离去。

一块牛排


汤姆·金用最后一口面包擦干净了盘子里最后一滴加了面粉的肉汤，然后将面包送进嘴里，满腹心事地慢慢嚼着。当他从桌边站起来时，仍然觉得饥肠辘辘，肚子饿得难受。可是，只有他一个人是吃过东西的。隔壁房间里，两个孩子早早就被打发上床睡觉了，为的是叫他们忘记自己还没有吃晚饭。他的妻子粒米未进，默默坐在那儿，担心地瞧着他。她是个工人阶级主妇，瘦削、憔悴，但风韵犹存，看得出她年轻时很漂亮。煮汤用的面粉是她跟走廊对面的邻居借来的，面包则是用家里唯一的两便士买的。

他坐在窗旁一把摇摇晃晃的椅子上，椅子被压得咯吱作响，而后他习惯性地把烟斗塞到嘴里，手伸进上衣口袋取烟丝。口袋里没有烟丝，他这才从遐思中清醒过来，皱皱眉头，怪自己如此健忘，然后把烟斗放到了一边。他动作很缓慢，几乎可以说是有点笨拙，就好像由于身上肌肉太多，不堪重负似的。他是个身体结实、看起来呆头呆脑的人，相貌也不算十分讨人喜欢。他身着破旧的粗布衣衫，邋里邋遢的，脚上的鞋很久以前曾换过鞋底，鞋帮已经旧了，烂得都快提不起那沉重的鞋底了。他的棉布衬衣是两个先令的廉价货，领口已经磨破，上面留有一些无法去除的油漆斑点。

不过，汤姆·金的脸让人一看就知道他是干什么的。那是一张典型的职业拳击手的脸，一张在拳击场上滚打了许多年的人才有的脸，具有一个斗士应该具有的所有特征，而且那些特征非常明显。显而易见，这是一张不苟言笑的脸，其性格一目了然。这张脸刮得光光的，两片嘴唇破了相，合在一起，显得十分严酷——那嘴看上去就像是脸上的一道疤。他的下巴显得咄咄逼人，厚实而粗野。他紧锁的浓眉之下，一双目光呆滞、毫无表情的眼睛深陷在厚重的眼皮之下。他看上去简直就像一只凶猛的野兽，尤其是他那双疲倦的狮子般的眼睛，一双好斗的野兽之眼。他的额头并不宽，发际线靠前，头发剪得很短，脑袋上每一个狰狞的肿块都暴露无遗。他的鼻子断过两次，因挨了无数次击打而变得奇形怪状。他的耳朵老是肿着，比原来大一倍，看似花椰菜，以此装点他的脸。他脸上的胡子虽然才刮过，却又长出一片青黑的胡楂。

总之，要是有人在黑胡同里或者哪个偏僻的地方看见这张脸，定会心生畏惧。不过，汤姆·金既不是罪犯，也没有干过作奸犯科的事。除了职业要求在拳击场上跟人打斗之外，他没有伤害过任何人。谁也没见他和别人吵过嘴。他是以拳击为职业的人，好斗的野蛮行为只留在拳击场上表现出来。一出拳击场，他就判若两人，变得行动迟缓、性情随和。年轻时他花钱如流水，慷慨大方，仗义疏财。他对人很少计较，从不树敌。对他来说，拳击只不过是一种职业。在拳击场上，他把人打伤、打残，甚至打死，心里却并无恶意。这纯粹是一桩生意。观众花钱到场子里来，就是为了看拳击手竞技，看谁把谁打翻在地。获胜方可以赢得大笔大笔的钱。他还记得二十年前跟乌鲁木鲁·高杰过招时的情景。他知道高杰的下巴在纽卡斯尔市的比赛中被打断，刚刚治好才四个月，于是就对准那个地方发动猛攻，在第九个回合里把高杰的下巴又打断了。这倒不是说他对髙杰有仇，而是因为打倒髙杰便可以赢得那一大笔钱。高杰也没有因此对他怀恨在心。比赛就是比赛，二人都清楚，彼此只是在场上一赌输赢。

汤姆·金向来话不多，此时他正默默地坐在窗前，一声不吭，满脸愁容地盯着自己的手。只见他的手背上青筋暴起，一根根血管粗大、肿胀；他的指关节曾经被击碎，已经变了形，一看就知道他出拳时的状况是何等惨烈。他从没听谁说过一个人的生与死取决于他动脉的好坏，但他很清楚这些粗大肿胀的血管意味着什么。他的心脏曾以过大的压力通过这些血管输送了太多的血液。而今，这些血管已经不管用了，由于过度拉伸而弹性尽失，由于血管肿胀，他的耐力也大不如以前。现在，他动辄便感到疲倦。他再也不能电闪雷鸣般地跟对手鏖战二十个回合了。过去，在拳击场上，双方竭尽全力拼搏，你一拳我一拳地打啊打，锣声响了一遍又一遍，进攻一次比一次猛烈，他被打得靠到绳子上，又把对手打得靠到绳子上，最后在第二十个回合里，搏斗到达白热化阶段，出拳快如闪电，全场观众站起来齐声喝彩，他冲锋、击打、躲闪，拳头雨点般落在对手身上，自己的身上也没少挨拳头。而他的心脏一直都在忠实地给各条血管输送汹涌的血液。那些血管虽然一时膨胀，但总会缩回原状。不过，每次比赛之后，虽然最初微不可察，但血管的确都会变得比前次粗一丁点儿。此刻他盯着手上的血管和被打碎了的指关节，仿佛看到了在他一拳打在本尼·琼斯（人称威尔士恶煞神）的脑袋上，第一次将一个指关节打碎之前，这双手年轻美丽的模样。

这时，饥饿感又一次朝他袭来。

“唉，难道我连一块牛排也吃不上吗！”他大声地嘟哝道，攥紧他那巨大的拳头，将胸中压抑着的怨气吐了出来。

“伯克家的店和索里家的店我都去过了。”他的妻子略带歉意地说。

“他们都不愿意吗？”他问道。

“少半分钱也不行。伯克说……”妻子欲言又止，把后半句话咽了回去。

“说呀！他说什么？”

“他说他认为今天晚上桑德尔会打败你，还说你欠他的账已经够多了。”

汤姆·金哼了一声，没有说什么，心里却浮想联翩，想到年轻时养的那只斗牛犬，他不知给它喂了多少牛排。那时，他就是要赊一千块牛排，伯克也会欣然同意的。可是，岁月催人老呀。汤姆·金老了。在二流俱乐部里混饭吃的老年拳击手还想从商贩那儿赊账，有点太异想天开了。

今天早晨一起床，他就渴望有块牛排吃，此时这种欲望仍未消散。对于今晚的这场拳击赛，他事先并没有好好训练过。今年澳大利亚大旱，生活艰难，连临时的工作都不容易找到。他训练时没有人陪练，伙食也不算好，常常吃了上顿没下顿。即便能找到工作，也是干些粗活，出卖几天的苦力。为了保持腿力，他常常在清晨围绕道曼公园(1)一圈一圈地跑。可是，这样的训练谈何容易——没有陪练员，又要挣钱养活妻子和两个孩子。自从他得到跟桑德尔比赛的机会之后，商贩们在赊账方面才对他稍微放宽了一点。欢乐俱乐部的秘书给他预支了三英镑（这是输掉比赛的人所能得到的钱数），死活不愿再多预支一点。他时不时能从老友那儿借几个先令应急。老友说很想多借给他一些，但遇到这大旱年，他们自己也举步维艰。说来说去，事实不容隐瞒——他训练得很不够，难以叫人满意。他本应吃好一点的伙食，保持轻松的心态。再说，他已是四十岁的人了，不如二十岁的时候容易进入状态。

“现在几点啦，莉兹？”他问道。

他的妻子到走廊对面问了一下，回来说：

“八点差一刻。”

“再过几分钟，他们就要开始第一场比赛了，”他说道，“只是预热赛。接下来是狄勒·威尔斯和格里德利的四回合比赛，然后是斯达莱特和一个海员拳击手的十回合比赛。一个小时之后才该我上场。”

随后，他沉默了下来，又过了十分钟才站了起来。

“老实说，莉兹，我训练得很不够。”

他伸手拿起帽子，向门口走去，没有去吻妻子——每次出门比赛前他都会吻她。不过，今天晚上，妻子主动吻了他，伸开双臂搂住他，让他俯下身子。他身材魁梧，像一座铁塔，而她娇小玲珑。

“祝你好运，汤姆，”她说，“你一定要打败他。”

“是啊，我一定要打败他，”他嘴里念叨着，“只能胜，不能输。我一定要打败他。”

妻子小鸟依人般偎傍在他怀里，而他哈哈一笑，装出很开心的样子。他的目光掠过妻子的肩头，扫视了一眼空空如也的房屋。这是他在这个世界上拥有的一切：欠租的房子，他的妻子和孩子。现在，他要离开这一切，融入夜色里，去为妻儿觅食。这样的觅食，可不是像现代工人那样用机器挣钱，而是用古老、原始、惨烈、野兽一样的方式，靠搏斗挣钱。

“我一定要打败他。”他又念叨了一遍，这次，声音里透露出了几分孤注一掷的语气，“打赢了，就能拿到三十英镑——除了还账，还能剩下很多钱。如果输了，就一分钱也拿不到，连坐电车回家的钱也不会给我。输家的那一份钱，秘书已经提前支给了我。再见，老伴，如果打赢了，我立刻就回家来。”

“我等着你回来！”妻子在走廊里冲着离去的他喊道。

从家到欢乐俱乐部足足有两英里的路。他边走边回忆自己事业的鼎盛期——他曾经是新南威尔士的重量级冠军，常常坐着马车去拳击场；押大注的赌家会抢着为他付车费，抢着跟他同行。那些人中有汤米·彭斯，还有那个美国黑人杰克·约翰逊——那些人可都是有私家汽车的高贵主儿。现在可好，他得靠两条腿走着去了！谁都知道，大赛之前辛辛苦苦走两英里的路可不是件好事。他老了，如今的世界对上了年纪的人来说真是寸步难行。除了找点粗活干，他别的什么也干不了。即便如此，他的断鼻梁、肿耳朵还都对他很不利。他真后悔当初没有学一样手艺。从长远来看，有样手艺会好一些。可惜没人为他指点迷津。不过，他心里清楚：即便有人指点，他也不会听的。想当年，日子过得真是轻松——财源滚滚……赛场上场面激烈、辉煌……比赛完，中间还有一段休养和放松的时间……逢迎巴结的大有人在，拍肩表示亲热的、握手寒暄的比比皆是，花花公子们争着请他喝酒，只为了能跟他说上一会儿话……他荣誉加身，全场的观众为他欢呼，他秋风扫落叶般将对手击倒，裁判宣布“金获胜！”，次日他的名字就会出现在报纸的体育专栏里。

那是何等风光的日子呀！可是现在细细想起来，当年被他打倒的都是些上了年纪的拳击手。那时，他年轻，正处于上升期，对手年纪大，处于没落期。怪不得他赢得那么轻松——原来那些老拳击手伤痕累累，血管肿胀，指关节被击碎，由于常年鏖战于拳击场，老骨头已累散了架。当年在鲁斯卡特湾比赛，他对自己在第十八个回合击败斯托希尔·比尔老头时的情景仍记忆犹新，记得老比尔赛后在更衣室里哇哇地哭，哭得像个小孩子一样。也许，老比尔当年也欠了房租，家里也有妻儿要养活。也许，比赛的那一天，比尔也渴望能吃上一块牛排。比尔披挂上阵，结果惨遭失败。而今，他自己在经历了相同的磨难之后总算明白了过来：在二十年前的那天晚上，在年轻的汤姆·金只是为了名和利而战时，斯托希尔·比尔是下了更大的赌注才上台比赛的，怪不得斯托希尔·比尔赛后会在更衣室里哭得那么伤心。

好吧，一个拳击手一生能打多少场比赛是注定的。这已经成了行内的铁律。有的人能打一百场艰苦卓绝的比赛，而有的则打二十场便草草收场。每个人的素质和体力都不一样，打的场数也不一样，一旦气数尽了，他的生涯也就完结了。按说，他打的场数比大多数同行都多，一场场艰苦卓绝的战斗，数量之多早已远远超过了自己的定数——这种比赛使心和肺运行到仿佛要炸开的程度，使动脉失去了弹性，使年轻时的那种平滑、柔韧的肌肉变得僵硬；由于持久的劳累过度，精神和身体都受到了巨大的损耗。是啊，在拳击手里他算得上是佼佼者。他这一辈的拳击手均已退出历史舞台，只剩下了他一个仍在坚持。他亲眼看着那些人纷纷谢幕，其中一些人的退出跟他不无关系。

拳击赛举办方常常安排他对阵那些老头，容他将老家伙们打得落花流水，每逢他们像老将斯托希尔·比尔一样躲在更衣室里痛哭失声时，他却笑了起来。而今，他自己老了，他们又安排年轻的选手来对付他。那个小屁孩桑德尔就是其中之一！他是从新西兰来的，在那儿战绩辉煌，但在澳大利亚却无人知道他的深浅，所以他们让他来对战老将汤姆·金。如果桑德尔旗开得胜，就安排他对垒更强的选手，赚更多的钱。因而，今晚这一仗桑德尔一定会拼死一搏。这一仗取胜，他便什么都有了——金钱、荣誉和前途；头发斑白的汤姆·金则是一只拦路虎，阻碍他走向金钱和荣誉。而汤姆·金取胜，什么也得不到，只能拿到三十英镑，用以偿还房租和买东西赊的账。他心潮起伏，迟钝的大脑中出现了年轻人的形象：正值韶华，所向披靡，肌肉柔韧，皮肤光滑，永不衰竭的心肺，对于“力量是有限的”论调总会付之一笑。是呀，年轻人简直就是涅墨西斯(2)。他们毁掉了拳击场上的老将，压根没想过同时也在摧毁他们自己。他们的动脉因此而肿胀，指关节因此而破碎。最后，他们又被后起之秀所毁掉。因为青春转瞬即逝，而岁月渐老。

走到卡斯尔雷街，他向左转，穿过三个街区，来到了欢乐俱乐部。一群聚集在俱乐部门外的街头小混混恭敬地给他让开了一条路，他听见其中一个对他的同伴说：“就是他！他就是汤姆·金！”

进门后，他在去更衣室的路上遇见了俱乐部的秘书——一个目光犀利、面目机灵的年轻人。他跟他握了握手。

“你感觉怎么样，汤姆？”他问道。

“感觉非常好。”他回答说。他情知自己是在睁着眼说瞎话。如果他有一英镑，他会立刻去买块可口的牛排来填肚子。

出了更衣室之后，他带着助手，穿过甬道走向大厅中央用绳子圈起来的拳击场。早已等在那里的观众爆发出一片欢呼声。他分别向左右的观众致意，尽管观众席里的面孔他几乎全不认识。大多数观众都是年轻人，当他在拳击场上赢得他最初的荣耀时，还没有出娘胎呢。他轻快地跳到台上，低头从绳子下面钻到他的那个角落，在一个折叠凳子上坐下。裁判杰克·鲍尔走过来，跟他握了握手。鲍尔是个没落的拳击手，已经有十多年没有作为主角登台过了。金很高兴由他当裁判。他们俩都是老一辈拳击手。即便他有犯规的动作，对桑德尔稍微过分一点，他知道鲍尔一定会放他一马的。

年轻气盛、雄心勃勃的重量级拳击选手接二连三地跳到台上，由裁判介绍给观众。介绍的同时，裁判还宣布了他们各自提出的挑战。

“年轻的普隆托，”鲍尔宣布道，“来自北悉尼，他愿意追加五十英镑，向获胜者挑战。”

观众席上爆发出一阵欢呼声；当桑德尔钻过绳子跳到台上，在他的那个角落坐下时，观众席再次爆发出一阵欢呼声。汤姆·金好奇地瞧着对面的桑德尔——再过几分钟，他们俩就会扭打在一起，展开无情的搏斗，二人都会使出全身的力气，恨不得一拳将对方打昏过去。他看不出桑德尔有什么特殊之处——对方跟他一样，也在拳击衣外面套着长裤子和绒线衫。桑德尔长得英俊潇洒，一头蓬松的金色卷发，从他粗壮、肌肉发达的脖子可以看出他身体很是健壮。

年轻的普隆托分别走到两个角落里，跟两位主角握了手，然后就跳下了台子。挑战在继续进行。不断有年轻人钻过绳子跳上台（都是些无名小辈，但胃口都很大），一个个当众宣布要靠自己的力量和技巧跟获胜者一决雌雄。要是在几年之前，正值自己所向无敌的黄金时代，汤姆·金看到这样的场面，一定会觉得又好笑，又无聊。而现在，他着了迷似的坐在那里，无法摆脱浮现在眼前的年轻人的幻象——这些年轻选手如雨后春笋在拳击界涌现，跳上台来，咋咋呼呼地挑战，一代代老将们在他们的面前倒下。他们踩着老将们的肩膀走向成功。这些年轻人如潮水般涌来，人数越来越多，汹涌澎湃，势不可挡，把老一辈人冲到一旁，而他们自己也在变老，也逐渐在走下坡路，身后又会有年轻人不断拥来，犹如长江后浪推前浪。新生代翅膀长硬，就将老一代踩在脚下，而后边则又会出现另一个新生代，永无止境。年轻人必然有他们的意志，这种意志永远不会消亡。

金向记者席瞟了一眼，冲《运动员报》的摩根和《裁判报》的科比特点了点头。随后，他伸出手，由桑德尔的一个助手严格地检查绕在他指节上的细绷带，并且在这个人的严密监视之下，由他自己的助手锡德·沙利文和查理·贝茨给他套上拳套，并把它们扎紧。同时，在桑德尔那个角落，也有金的一个助手在履行同样的职责。桑德尔的长裤被拽了下来，当他站起身时，他的套头绒线衫也被脱了下来。汤姆·金望过去，看到的是年轻的化身：厚厚的胸脯，强壮的筋肉，一身肌肉就像活物一样在缎子似的白皮肤之下滑动，浑身上下充满了勃勃生机。汤姆·金知道，这样的生命还没有在长期搏击中，从疼痛的毛孔里散尽其朝气，年轻人经历了这样的搏击后，就要付出代价，当他从这里走出去的时候，就不会像进来时那么年轻了。

两个人走向前，准备交手。当的一声锣响，助手们噼里啪啦收起折叠凳，爬出场外。二人握过手后，立刻摆出了迎战的姿势。转眼间，桑德尔进进退退，一个左勾拳打在金的眼上，又一个右勾拳落在了他的肋骨上，忽而灵巧地跳开躲闪，忽而咄咄逼人地冲过来进攻，就像一个由钢铁零件和弹簧组成的机械装置，受到一种微力扳机的操纵。他动作敏捷、灵巧，一招一式令人眼花缭乱，引得全场的观众大声喝彩。但是汤姆没有眼花。他打过的比赛不胜枚举，遇到过的年轻选手多之又多。他深知花拳绣腿不顶用——过于敏捷和过于灵巧的招式不具备危险性。显而易见，桑德尔来势汹汹，想速战速决。这是意料之中的。年轻人都是这样——一开始就猛打猛冲，恨不得一下子就能凭借自己的虎力和冲劲如泰山压顶般压倒对方，岂不知这样会消耗自己的精力和锐气。

桑德尔进退有方，四面出击，忽而此处，忽而彼处，脚步轻盈，心情急切，快如一阵疾风，只看得见他雪白而结实的肌肉晃来晃去，一次次发动令人眼花缭乱的进攻，躲闪、腾跳，如飞梭般飞来飞去，巡回往返千次有余，目标只有一个，那就是摧毁汤姆·金，因为汤姆·金是他走向成功的绊脚石。汤姆·金则耐心地忍受着。他心里有数，虽然自己不再年轻，但他了解年轻人。他心想：必须按兵不动，等到对方消耗掉一些体力再说。当桑德尔一个重拳打来时，他暗中一笑，故意将脑袋一偏，让那一拳落在了自己的头顶。这一招实在恶毒，但根据拳击规则又是很正当的。拳击场上，选手理应当心自己的指关节，如果他非得用指关节击打对手的头顶，那就是自讨苦吃了。金本来可以把头一低，让那一拳落空，谁都伤不着，可他想起早年跟威尔士恶煞神对决，自己一拳打在对方的头顶上，将指关节击碎的经历，才用了这样的计谋。比赛就是比赛，容不得心软。这一招叫桑德尔失去了一个指关节。眼下，桑德尔不会放在心上，而会打下去，全然不管那个指关节，势头不减地将比赛进行到底。不过，以后等到时间长了，打的场数多了，麻烦就来了，那时他会为失去这个指关节而痛惜，回想起他是一拳打在汤姆·金的头上才将指关节击碎的。

第一局完全是桑德尔的天下，他那快如旋风的猛攻赢得了全场的喝彩。他出拳有排山倒海之势，将金压倒，而金只是在防卫。金从不主动出拳，只是一个劲地遮挡、躲闪，或者用身子扭抱对方以免遭到痛击。他偶尔进行一次佯攻，对方重拳落下时，却摇摇头躲开，步伐坚实，从不跳跃弹起，不随便浪费一丝一毫的气力。这个谨慎的老拳击手，必须等到桑德尔将年轻的锐气发泄完，才敢进行反击。金动作缓慢，却有条不紊，慢悠悠转动着罩着厚眼皮的眼睛珠子，看上去似睡非睡，又像是有些头昏眼花。岂不知这是一双能观六路的眼睛，在拳击场上历练了二十多年，任什么都逃不过它们的注意。即便一拳打到了跟前，这双眼睛也不会眨动一下，而是冷静地观察，测算着那一拳和他之间的距离。

第一局结束后有一分钟的休息时间，他瘫坐在他的那个角落里，两腿伸开，胳膊搭在两旁的绳子上，胸脯和腹部剧烈地一起一伏，大口吸进助手们用毛巾扇过来的空气。他闭上眼睛，听着场子里鼎沸的人声。“你为什么不还手，汤姆？”许多人在喊，“你不会害怕他吧，对不对？”

“肌肉发硬了，”他听见一个坐在前排的人这样议论，“他的动作快不了啦。我赌桑德尔赢，赌金加倍，用英镑计算。”

锣声一响，两人都离开各自的角落，走上前去。桑德尔求战心切，两人之间的距离有四分之三是由他大步流星跨过的，而金情愿少走几步。这完全符合他那节省体力的策略。大赛前，他训练得不充分，又没有足够的食物填肚子，所以每走一步都得算计好。再说，来比赛场之前，他已经走了两英里的路了。这一局跟上一局情况雷同，桑德尔的进攻仍如暴风骤雨。观众对金感到气愤，大声责问他为何不还手。金只是装出进攻的样子，虚晃几拳，拳拳落空，除此之外，他只是一个劲招架、退缩，或者扭抱对方。桑德尔渴望速战速决，可是金有自己的算盘，拒绝按他的路子打。他咧嘴一笑，那张在拳击场上被打得伤痕累累的脸上露出一种忧愁和悲情，战术上仍我行我素，保存着自身的力量，表现出上年纪的人才有的谨慎态度。而血气方刚的桑德尔表现出的则是青春的豪放和纵情，任意挥霍着自己的精力。金不愧为拳击场上的将才，其运筹帷幄的智慧源自于常年艰苦卓绝的搏斗。他目光冷静、头脑清晰，行动方寸不乱，耐心等待着桑德尔把锐气消耗殆尽。大多数观众都觉得他大势已去，已无指望逆转，于是便吆喝着要将押在桑德尔身上的赌注再加一倍。但也有几个另有看法的观众，他们了解金过去的行事风格，认为将赌注压在他身上容易赢钱。

第三局开始的时候，仍是桑德尔在唱独角戏，由他一个人发起进攻，出拳猛揍对方。半分钟过后，桑德尔由于过分自信，露出了一个破绽。金眼疾手快，刹那间，一个右勾拳打了过去。这是他货真价实的第一拳——一个勾拳，胳膊弯成拱形，使拳头坚实有力，半扭转身子，将全身的重量都压在了拳头上。这就像一头似乎沉睡着的狮子，突然闪电似的伸出一只爪子来。下颚侧面被击中的桑德尔，像一头公牛般轰然倒下。观众惊呆了，敬畏得发出一片低低的喝彩声。他们发现这个老拳击手的肌肉并没有变得僵硬，一拳下去，如铁锤重击。

桑德尔魂飞魄散，翻过身想站起来，可他的助手们大声叫他别动，等着裁判数数。他单膝跪着，准备站起来的样子，等待着来到他身旁的裁判在他耳朵边大声数数。裁判数到九的时候，他站起来摆出了准备搏斗的姿势。看着他，汤姆·金不由扼腕叹息，觉得刚才那一拳要是离对方的下巴尖再近一英寸就好了。那样，他就能把桑德尔打昏，揣上三十英镑的奖金回家去见自己的妻儿了。

这一局已接近尾声，快要到规定的三分钟了，此时桑德尔对自己的敌手方才肃然起敬，敬重起动作缓慢、睡眼惺忪的金。金眼见这局比赛即将结束，看到助手们蹲在场外，时刻准备着钻过绳子跳进场内，于是便将搏斗的中心点向自己的角落那儿引。锣声一响，他立刻就坐到了他的凳子上休息，而桑德尔则需要走完斜穿赛场的对角线才能回到他自己的角落里。这虽然是件小事，但若干小事汇集在一起便不是小事了。桑德尔多走几步路，就多消耗几分体力，同时会减少一些宝贵的休息时间。每一局开始，金离开他的角落时总是磨磨蹭蹭的，这样便迫使对方前来迎战时多走一些路。每一局结束时，他则将搏斗引向他的那个角落，锣声一响他就可以立刻坐下来休息。

接下来又是两局的拼杀，金精打细算地节省着力气，而桑德尔仍在肆意挥霍。后者进攻势头猛烈，只求速决，让金感到很不舒服，因为对方雨点般的拳头有相当大一部分打中了他。观众席中，急性子的年轻人大声催促他迎战，拼死一搏，而他依旧不紧不慢，坚持自己的打法。后来在第六局，桑德尔又大意了一次，汤姆·金那可怕的右勾拳又闪电般打中了他的下巴，于是桑德尔又等到裁判数到九才起来。

打到第七局的时候，桑德尔的优势已不再，他开始稳扎稳打——他意识到这将是他入行以来最艰难的一场比赛。汤姆·金固然是老家伙，却比他以前遇到过的任何老家伙都厉害——这个老家伙从不丧失理智，在防御方面技高一筹，不出拳则已，一出拳便如铁锤砸来，无论是左勾拳还是右勾拳，一拳就能把人打翻在地。不过，话又说回来，汤姆·金是不敢频频出拳的。他一直没敢忘记自己的指关节已经被击碎，情知要想坚持打完这场比赛，每一拳都必须击中要害。当他坐在自己的角落里，望着对面的敌手时，心里突然产生了一个想法，如果把自己的智慧与桑德尔的活力结合在一起，就可以造就一名世界重量级拳击赛的冠军。不过，这也是问题所在。桑德尔绝不会当上世界冠军，因为他缺乏智慧，而获得智慧又得付出青春才行，等到他有了智慧，青春也就成了东逝之水。

凡是对自己有利的方法，金无所不用。只要一有机会，他就扭住对手，往往还会趁机用肩膀硬撞对方的肋骨。按照拳击的理论，用肩膀撞击和用拳头攻击同样有效，会造成相同的伤害，而且就节省体力来说，前一种方法远胜后一种。一扭住对方，金就将全身的重量压上去，死活不愿松开，非逼得裁判过来干涉，把他们俩掰开，尚未学会趁此休息的桑德尔每次还会协助裁判一把。每当金冲过来进行贴身战，用肩膀抵住他的肋骨，把头靠在他的左臂上时，他总是忍不住地挥舞起双臂，扭动着肌肉，几乎总是把右拳从自己背后挥过去，打那个突出的脸。这一手打得很巧妙，观众非常钦佩，然而却并不会造成较大的伤害，因而也只能算是白费气力。可是桑德尔不知疲倦，也不知节制，金见状总是咧嘴一笑，顽强地忍受着。

桑德尔后来形成了一种套路，老是用右拳猛击金的身体，看上去就好像金遭到了重击似的。老观众却不以为然，他们倒是欣赏金的打法——金每次都会在对方的拳头落下之前，左拳巧妙地打向对方的二头肌。诚然，桑德尔拳拳击中了金，但由于自己的二头肌次次都被击中，力量便被弱化了许多。在第九局里，金在一分钟内一连三次挥动右臂，用右勾拳击打在桑德尔的下巴上，桑德尔三次倒地，如一堵墙一样重重倒在垫子上。每一次，桑德尔都会休息够规定的九秒钟，然后站起来，虽然摇摇晃晃，却仍然强壮有力。这时，他进攻的速度大大放慢，浪费的力量也随之减少。这是一场恶斗，而他仍在持续消耗自己的主要本钱——青春，汤姆·金的本钱则是经验。如今，金的体力衰退，精力大不如前，然而他却有了计谋，有了在长期拳击赛中积累起的智慧，懂得怎样谨慎地运用自己的力量。他不仅懂得绝不能有一个多余的动作，还懂得怎样引诱对方消耗体力。他一次又一次运动手脚和躯体，假装要进攻，引得桑德尔后跳、躲闪或反击，他自己以逸待劳，却叫桑德尔以劳待逸。这是一个拳坛老将的战略部署。

第十局一开局，汤姆·金就开始用左勾拳直击对方的脸，阻止了对方猛烈的攻势。这时的桑德尔已学乖，立刻收回左臂，低头一闪，把右拳一勾，从侧面向他的脑袋砸去。这一拳打得太高，收效并不十分大，但金挨了这一拳，眼前一黑，又出现了过去的那种大脑短暂丧失意识的症状。刹那间，或者说在极短极短的一瞬间，他完全顿了下来。在这一瞬间，对手的身影从他的视野中消失了，由白白的一片观众的面孔组成的背景也消失了。这一瞬间过去之后，他又看到了对手以及由观众面孔组成的背景。他好像睡了一会儿，方才睁开眼睛一样。不过，他丧失意识的时间极短，还没等他倒下去，便一闪过去了。观众只看到他摇晃了一下，膝盖一弯，紧接着就见他恢复了过来，用左肩紧紧地护住下巴。

桑德尔又用同样的套路打了几拳，打得金头晕目眩，但他抵挡住了，继而转守为攻。他假装要使用左勾拳，后退半步，然而却用尽全身的力气挥动右拳直击对方的上首，时间计算得分秒不差，趁着桑德尔低头躲闪之际，直直地、重重地打到了他的脸上，打得他两脚腾空，缩成一团向后一歪，脑袋和肩膀同时砸在了垫子上面。金连着发动了两次这样的进攻，然后放开手痛揍对手，一拳又一拳，将对手打得靠在了绳子上。他不让桑德尔有喘息或还手之机，接连出拳，使得全场观众站起来欢呼，喝彩声此起彼伏、不绝于耳。可是，桑德尔的气力和耐力均不同凡响，他仍站立不倒，看起来非被打昏不可。台子旁边有位警官害怕这可怕的一幕发生，急忙起身要阻止他们再打下去。就在这时，锣声响了，宣告这一局结束。桑德尔摇摇晃晃回到他的角落里，对警官说他一点事也没有，仍然充满了力量。为了证明这一点，他向后连跳了两下，警官一看只好作罢。

汤姆·金瘫在自己的角落里，气喘如牛，心里大失所望。假如比赛在刚才中止了，裁判就会宣布他为赢家，奖金就会归他。跟桑德尔不一样，他参加比赛不是为了荣誉或者前程，而是为了那三十英镑的奖金。现在可好，经过这一分钟的休息，桑德尔便会恢复过来的。

后生可畏——这句话猛然跳进了他的脑海里。记得头一次听到这话，是在他将斯托希尔·比尔打得落花流水的那天晚上。那天晚上打完比赛，一个富佬请他喝酒，拍拍他的肩膀，对他说了这句话。后生的确可畏！那个富佬所言不虚。在很早以前的那天晚上，他曾是个后生。今日的后生却坐在对面的角落里。至于他自己，则是一个已经苦战了半个小时的老人。如果按桑德尔那样打法，他恐怕连一刻钟也撑不下来。问题的关键在于：他的体力无法恢复。他血管肿胀、心脏疲惫，这使他在中间休息的时间里无法重新积聚起力量。一开始，他的力量就不够充沛，两腿发沉，现在腿肚子都有点抽筋了。比赛前，他就不该走那两英里的路。还有，他早上一起来就渴望吃块牛排，却没能吃得上。想起这来他就恨得牙根痒痒，恨肉店的老板不肯赊账给他。让一个老人空着肚子上台比赛，谈何容易！区区一块牛排，最多不过值几个便士，然而对现在的他来说却意味着三十英镑。

随着一声锣响，第十一局开始了。桑德尔几个箭步冲了过来，显示出一种他实际并不具有的锐气。金情知那只不过是虚张声势，自打有了拳击赛就有了这种把戏。他扭抱住对方，躲避锋芒，然后分身，容桑德尔摆开阵势——这是他渴望看到的。他先是佯装用左勾拳，使对方低头一闪，同时举拳招架，然后他便退半步，用右勾拳以泰山压顶之势砸在对方的脸上，打得桑德尔摔倒在了垫子上。这之后，他发动凌厉攻势，不让对方有片刻喘息机会，虽然自己也挨上几拳，但他击中对方的次数要多得多，打得桑德尔靠在了绳子上。他左一拳右一拳，用各种拳路击打对方，挣脱对方的扭抱，或者用重拳打得对方甚至来不及扭抱住他。每逢桑德尔快要倒下去的时候，他就举起一只手撑住他，另一只手立刻挥拳砸过去，打得他靠在绳子上，倒也无法倒了。

这时候，全场都疯狂了，成了汤姆·金的天下，几乎每一个人都在为他助威。“加油，汤姆！”“打垮他！打垮他！”“胜利属于你，汤姆！胜利属于你，汤姆！”比赛就要在旋风式的攻击之下结束了，而观众花钱来这儿，要看的就是这种场面。

半小时以来，汤姆·金一直在保存实力，力图此刻毕其功于一役，把所有的力量都用了出来。对他而言，成败在此一举。他的气力消耗得很快，他只希望在最后一点气力用完之前，能够打得对方爬不起来。因此，他一面继续猛攻，一面冷静地估计着他拳头的分量以及它们造成的损伤。他意识到桑德尔是一个很难被打垮的人。桑德尔的体力和耐力简直强到极点——那是年轻人未经损伤的体力和耐力。桑德尔势必能成为拳坛新星。他具有成功的素质。只有这样坚韧的体质，方能造就叱咤风云的拳击手。

桑德尔站不稳了，踉踉跄跄的，但汤姆自己的腿也在抽筋，指关节也疼了起来。他咬紧牙关继续猛烈攻击，可每一拳打出去，他的手都疼得钻心。现在，他虽然一拳也没有挨到，力量却在锐减，固然拳拳击中要害，分量却大不如先前了。他每打一拳都要付出艰苦的努力，两腿似灌了铅一般重，移动时显然有些费劲。桑德尔的支持者看见了他的这种征兆为之振奋，开始为桑德尔大声加油。

金受到刺激，振作起精神来，连着打了两拳——一个左勾拳瞄得稍微高了些，打在了对方的胸口上，一个右勾拳打在了对方的下巴上。这两拳打得并不重，可是桑德尔已经无力支撑，开始眼冒金星，便一头栽倒，躺在那儿打起了哆嗦。裁判走过来，冲着他的耳朵开始数那决定命运的秒数。如果在数到十秒之前他还没有起来，他就输了。观众们都站在那儿等候，全场鸦雀无声。金两腿发抖，勉强坚持着。他感到天旋地转，觉得观众的脸好像一片大海，在眼前波翻浪涌，裁判数数的声音似从遥远的地方传到他耳朵里来。不过，他意志笃定，认为自己稳操胜券，觉得桑德尔挨了那样一顿重拳，是不可能再站起来的。

只有血气方刚的年轻选手才能站起来——桑德尔站起来了。裁判数到四秒的时候，他翻了个身，面孔朝下，瞎摸着去抓绳子。数到七的时候，他挣扎着单膝跪起，似醉汉一般脑袋晃来晃去的。当裁判高声数道“九！”，他已站得笔直，摆出了标准的防御姿势，用左臂护住脸，右臂护住腹部。他护住要害部位之后，便脚步蹒跚地向金靠过去，希望能扭住他，以争取时间。

桑德尔站起来的瞬间，金就冲了过去，不料打出去的两拳都被对方的胳膊挡住了。一转眼，桑德尔便贴了过来，拼命地抱紧他，裁判介入将两人分开。金也急于摆脱纠缠。他知道年轻人恢复得快，认为只要不让桑德尔恢复元气，对方就会成为他的手下败将。只要狠狠的一拳就可以解决问题。桑德尔败局已定，而他必胜无疑。他在战略和战术上都已占了上风。桑德尔趔趔趄趄，立足不稳，身处一个节骨眼上，成败在此一举。只要结结实实给他一拳，就能够将他放翻，让他再也爬不起来。这时，汤姆·金突然感到一阵悲哀，想起了自己在家里渴望吃到的那块牛排，觉得有那块牛排为这必要的一拳垫底就好了。他拼尽全力打了一拳，但这一拳不够重，也不够快。桑德尔摇摆了一下，没有摔倒，踉踉跄跄地走到绳子跟前，靠在了绳子上。金摇摇晃晃地跟了过去，忍住钻心的疼痛又打了一拳。可是他的身体已经不听指挥了。他只剩下一种战斗的意志了，而由于疲劳过度，这种战斗的意志也变得薄弱和模糊了。这一拳原本是瞄准对方下巴的，却落在了对方的肩膀上。他有意打高些，谁知疲倦的肌肉不听指挥。这一拳的反推力很强，使得他连连后退，差点摔倒。接着，他又打了一拳，这一拳完全落了个空。身体极度虚弱的他倒在了桑德尔的身上，紧紧扭抱住对方的身体，以免自己摔倒在地。

金靠在那儿，不愿再分开。他力气已尽，到了穷途末路。后生可畏——即便在两人靠在一起的时候，他也感觉得到桑德尔的力量在一点点增强。等到裁判把他们分开，他看到的是一个恢复了元气的朝气蓬勃的青年。桑德尔每时每刻都在变得越来越强壮。他头几拳软绵绵的，不起什么作用，后来拳头变得又准又狠。汤姆·金眼睛昏花，他看见那只戴手套的拳头朝自己的下颚砸过来，想伸胳膊将其挡住。他看到了危险，想采取措施应对，可是胳膊像是灌满了铅一样，重得抬不起来，怎么举也举不起。他试图用意志力将它举起来，而就在这时，那只戴手套的拳头击中了他。他砰地挨了重重一拳，像被闪电击中了一样，顿时眼前一黑昏了过去。

再睁开眼时，他已经坐在了他的那个角落里，只听见观众喊声震天，犹如邦迪海滩(3)的海浪在咆哮。他的后脑勺下垫着一块湿海绵，锡特·沙利文正在向他脸上和胸口上喷冷水，让他清醒过来。他的手套已经被取下。桑德尔正弯下腰跟他握手。他一点也不恨这个打昏他的人，于是便真诚地紧紧握了握对方的手，握得他那碎了的指关节都发痛了。之后，桑德尔走到台子中央，观众停止了山呼海啸般的欢呼声，接着便听见他宣布自己接受年轻的普隆托的挑战，而且提出要加注，把赌注增加到一百英镑。金在一旁漠然地观望着，他的助手则忙着为他擦去冒着热气的汗水，揩干他的脸，准备送他离场。他觉得很饿。不是那种一点点折磨人的寻常的饥饿感，而是一种令人虚脱的饥饿感，先是心口一紧，继而疼痛传遍全身。回想起刚才的恶战，他打得桑德尔摇摇欲坠，站都站不稳，几近失败。唉，怨都怨自己没能吃上那块牛排！正是缺了那块牛排，那关键的一拳才丧失了威力，导致了他的失败。失败的根源完全是那块牛排！

他的助手们搀扶着他，想帮助他钻过绳子。他挣脱他们的手，自个儿低头钻了过去，重重地跳到了台下。助手们走在前边，为他在人头攒动的中央通道上辟出一条路，他则跟在后面。在更衣室换好衣服后，他向大街上走去，在大厅入口处有一个年轻人跟上来同他说话。

“刚才你已经控制住了他，为什么不把他放翻呢？”那个年轻人问。

“你懂个什么，见鬼去吧！”汤姆·金说完，下了台阶，走到了人行道上。

街角那家酒馆的门开得大大的，只见里面灯火辉煌，女服务员笑容满面，他听见许多顾客都在谈论这场比赛，还听见吧台那儿传来叮当叮当响的硬币声。有人喊他进去喝一杯。他明显犹豫了一下，随后便谢绝了，继续走他的路。

他口袋里连一个铜板也没有，回家的两英里路好像特别长。他的确老了。走过道曼公园的时候，他突然在一条凳子上坐了下来，他想到了正在家里眼巴巴等着他，盼望着知道这场比赛结果的妻子。这事实比任何致命的拳头都沉重，简直叫他无法去面对。

他感到虚弱不堪、浑身酸痛，碎了的指关节疼痛难忍，似乎在警告他：即便能找份粗活干，也要等一个星期后才可以握得住锄头或者铲子。心口饿得发慌，那种感觉让他直想呕吐。他心里感到一阵悲凉，眼中涌出了少有的泪水。他双手捂脸，洒下了英雄泪，不禁想起了年老的斯托希尔·比尔，想起了很久以前的那个晚上自己是怎样对待他老人家的。可怜的斯托希尔·比尔老前辈呀！现在他总算明白了当年比尔为什么在更衣室里放声痛哭了。

墨西哥人


1


没有人对他知根知底——最不了解他的恐怕要数革命委员会里的人。在他们的眼里，他是个“神秘人物”，是个“大爱国者”。他以自己的方式行事，和他们一样，也是在为即将来到的墨西哥革命埋头苦干。一开始，委员会里没人喜欢他，过了很久他们才发现他是同路人。他头一次出现在他们那拥挤、忙乱的活动场所时，大家都怀疑他是个奸细，是迪亚斯(1)的秘密警察收买来的爪牙。委员会里已有很多同志被关进美国各地的普通监狱和军事监狱，还有一些同志甚至披枷带锁被押出了边境，面朝土坯墙排成队，在那儿遭到处决。

第一眼看到这个男孩子，大家对他的印象就不好。称他为男孩子，是因为他未满十八岁，而且照他的年龄来看，他的个头也不算高。他说他叫菲力普·利维拉，说他的志向是为革命效力。他就说了这么两句话——一句废话也没有，也不做进一步的解释，然后就站在那儿等待着，脸上没有笑容，眼神缺乏善意。连身材高大、脾气暴烈的保利诺·维拉也感到心里一哆嗦，觉得他是个阴险、可怕、令人捉摸不透的人物，黑黑的眼睛里有一种阴冷似毒蛇的神情。那双眼睛像冷冷的火焰在熊熊燃烧，似乎凝聚着深仇大恨。他的目光扫过那些革命者的脸，落到了矮小的赛斯比太太正在忙着敲字的打字机上。在他们目光交汇的那一刹那——她那时碰巧抬起了头——她也感觉到他身上有一种难以名状的东西，以至不由停下了手。而后为了继续敲那封她正在写的信，她不得不往回读了读打过的内容。

保利诺·维拉询问似的看了看阿莱兰诺和拉莫斯，后两者也询问似的看了看他，然后又互相对视了一眼。他们的目光中出现了迟疑不决的神色。这个身材瘦削的小伙子来历不明，让人感到不安。他们是正直的普通革命者，对迪亚斯及其暴政恨之入骨，但这种仇恨是充满朴素爱国主义情怀的仇恨，而这位小伙子则像一个不可理解的谜团，叫他们吃不透。他有些与众不同，然而究竟有哪些不同，他们也说不出个所以然。维拉历来冲动，遇事不假思索，这时率先打破了僵局。

“很好，”他冷冷地说，“你说你愿意为革命效力。那就请你脱下外套，把外套挂到那边去。容我交代一下……你过来，这儿有水桶和抹布，这里的地板脏了，你就先把地板擦一擦吧，把别的房间的地也擦一擦。接下来就是洗痰盂和擦窗户。”

“这算是为革命效力吗？”小伙子问。

“是为革命效力。”维拉回答道。

利维拉用冰冷而狐疑的目光看了他们一眼，随即动手脱外套。

“那好吧。”他口中说道。

除此之外，他再没有说别的。之后，他每天都来干活——扫地、擦地板、收拾房间。在他们中最勤快的同志来工作前，他就已经清理掉炉灰，拿来了煤炭和引火柴，生着了炉子。

“我可以睡在这儿吗？”有一次，他问道。

啊哈！狐狸的尾巴终于露出来了——果然是迪亚斯的爪牙！睡在他们委员会的活动场所，就可以刺探情报，掌握墨西哥境内同志的名单以及地址！他的请求被拒绝了。此事利维拉也再没有提起过。他在哪儿歇宿、在哪儿吃饭以及如何糊口，大家一无所知。一次，阿莱兰诺提出要给他几美元的工钱，他摇摇头拒绝了。维拉过来帮着敲边鼓，劝他把钱收下，而他说：

“这是为革命工作，不取报酬。”

如今，发动一场革命是需要资金的，而委员会的状况总是捉襟见肘。委员们忍饥挨饿、埋头苦干，再苦再累也无怨言。不过，有的时候，革命的成败似乎也就是几美元的问题。有一次，那也是第一次，由于拖欠了两个月的房租，房东威胁说要赶他们出去。正是菲力普·利维拉——那个衣着寒酸而褴褛的打扫房间的小工，拿来了六十块金币，放在了梅·赛斯比的桌子上。这样的情形出现了不止一次。一天，几台打字机忙个不停，打出了三百封信（有求援信；有向劳工组织发出的呼吁书；有请求报纸编辑报道正义新闻的信件；有反对美国法院以高压手段对待革命者的抗议书），而这些信件由于缺邮资无法寄出。维拉父亲留给维拉的那块老式的金怀表不见了。梅·赛斯比中指上戴着的金戒指也是。真是到了山穷水尽的地步。拉莫斯和阿莱兰诺捋着他们的长胡子，苦于无计。这些信必须寄出去，可是买邮票，邮局却不愿意赊账。利维拉见状，戴上帽子出了门，回来时，将一千张两分的邮票放在了梅·赛斯比的桌子上。

“谁知道这是不是从迪亚斯那儿拿来的赃钱。”维拉对同志们说。

其他的人抬了抬眉毛，都有点说不准。就这样，为革命情愿当清洁工的菲力普·利维拉每当遇到这种情况，便拿出真金白银来供委员会使用。

可是，委员们还是无法喜欢上他。他们不了解他。他为人处世跟他们大不相同，从不跟人深谈，也不愿让别人打听他的事情。他虽然只是个毛头小伙子，他们也不敢冒昧地对他盘根问底。

“也许他是个伟大而孤独的人吧。谁知道呢，谁知道呢。”阿莱兰诺无奈地说。

“他有点缺乏人情味。”拉莫斯说。

“他的内心冷酷无情，”梅·赛斯比说，“他的生活中没有阳光和笑声。他像一个死人，却又充满了可怕的活力。”

“他肯定经历过许多磨难，”维拉说，“没吃过万千苦头的人，绝不会这个样子。说来，他还只是个孩子呀！”

不管怎样，他们还是无法喜欢上他。他从不多话，从不打听任何情况，也不献言献策。大家谈论革命，谈得慷慨激昂的时候，他总是站在旁边听着，脸上毫无表情，仿佛一个死人，唯有一双眼睛在冷冷地燃烧着。那双眼睛盯着发言人的脸，瞧瞧这个，再看看那个，目光似闪着亮光的冰锥般刺人，让人觉得慌乱和不安。

“他不是奸细，”维拉私下对梅·赛斯比说，“而是一个爱国者。请相信我的话，他是咱们中间最伟大的爱国者。我知道他是，能感觉得到他是，无论是从情感方面还是理智方面都可以感觉得到。只不过我对他的根底仍一无所知。”

“他的脾气很坏。”梅·赛斯比说。

“这我知道，”维拉打了个哆嗦说，“他曾用他那双眼睛盯过我，里面没有爱，只有威胁，野蛮得像猛虎一样。我知道，假如我做出对革命事业不忠的事情，他一定会杀了我的。他没有感情，如钢刀般冷酷，似冰霜一样寒气逼人。就像在冬夜里，一个人在荒郊野外快要冻死时看到的冷冰冰的月光。实不相瞒，我不怕迪亚斯和他的那帮杀人魔王，可是对这个小伙子，却有几分惧怕。他周身散发着死神的气息。”

不过，说服大家第一次信任利维拉的也是维拉。洛杉矶和下加利福尼亚(2)之间的通讯线被破坏。三个同志自投罗网，当局将他们枪杀了。另有两个同志也在美国被捕，被关进了洛杉矶的监狱。联邦军司令胡安·阿尔瓦拉多是一个恶魔，他破坏了他们所有的计划。无论是下加利福尼亚的革命积极分子，还是刚刚加入的新人，委员会再也无法跟他们取得联系了。

年轻的利维拉奉命南下。他回来的时候，通讯线恢复了，胡安·阿尔瓦拉多也死了。他被发现死在床上，胸口插了一把刀，只露出来个刀柄。此事已超出了利维拉所执行命令的范围，但委员会的人知道这是非常时期，也就没有追究。他什么也没说。大家相互交换了眼色，满脸猜测。

“我早就告诉过你们，”维拉说道，“迪亚斯最应该怕的是这个小伙子，而非别人。他下手狠，毫不留情，简直就是上帝派来的使者。”

梅·赛斯比曾说他脾气坏，大家也感觉到了，后来发生的情况亦证实了这一点。他露面时，不是嘴唇破了，就是脸青了一块，要不就是一只耳朵发肿。很清楚，他一定是在外边的哪个地方跟人打架了——那是一个他吃饭、睡觉、挣钱，以他们所不熟悉的方式活动的地方。过了一阵子，他开始为他们每周一期的宣传革命的小报排字。而有的时候，他则有些力不从心——因为他不是指节上皮破血流，就是大拇指受伤动弹不得，要不就是左臂或右臂耷拉下来使不上劲，脸上露出痛苦不堪的表情。

“真是个浪荡子。”阿莱兰诺说。

“看来他经常出入那些乌七八糟的地方。”拉莫斯说。

“可是，他的钱是从哪儿弄来的呢？”维拉说，“就在今天，我才刚刚知道，买纸的钱是他付的——整整一百四十块！”

“他常常说不来就不来，”梅·赛斯比说，“连个解释的话也没有。”

“应该派人调查一下。”拉莫斯提议说。

“我可不愿去盯他的梢。”维拉说，“要是去了，你们恐怕再也见不到我了，要见也是见我的尸体。他的脾气太可怕了，发作起来，就是上帝也别想拦住他。”

“在他面前，我觉得自己可怜得像个小孩子。”拉莫斯坦白地说。

“我觉得他代表着一种力量，简直就像是原始人、野狼、咬人的响尾蛇、蜇人的蜈蚣。”阿莱兰诺说。

“他是革命的化身，”维拉说，“是革命的火焰和灵魂，在厉声呼喊着人们起来复仇，但行动的时候却无声无息，静悄悄地置敌人于死地。他俨然就是一个惩恶扬善的天使，夜深人静时巡回于大地。”

“我真是为他感到难过，”梅·赛斯比说，“他身边没有朋友，他痛恨所有人，之所以能够容忍咱们，是因为咱们可以为他实现愿望铺平道路。他很孤独……一个人孤苦伶仃的。”说到此处，她的声音有些哽咽，泪水模糊了双眼。

利维拉的确行踪诡秘，有时一连一个星期都不见他露面。一次，他出外一个月未归。每次出外归来后，他都会拿出一些金币放在梅·赛斯比的桌子上，什么情况也不解释，什么话也不多讲。此后，他会一连数天或数个星期待在委员会，全身心地投入工作。过不了多久，他又会开始白天出去，只在早晨和晚上出现。这种时候，他一大早就到委员会来，晚上又待得很晚。阿莱兰诺曾发现他午夜时分还在排字，手上添了新伤，指关节肿肿的，要不就是嘴唇裂了口子，血还在流。

形势危急，快到关键时刻了。革命能不能发动起来，完全取决于委员会的作为了，而委员会经济情况窘迫。他们比以往任何时候都缺钱，可是弄钱却越来越困难。爱国志士们已经捐出了他们的全部钱财，再也拿不出一分钱了。养路工们（从墨西哥逃出来的苦役）拿出他们微薄的工钱，把一半都捐给了委员会。但这只是杯水车薪。多年的艰苦奋斗、运筹帷幄和秘密工作，眼看就要结出硕果了，时机已经成熟。一切的付出就像被放在天平上的砝码，只要再加一把劲，再做最后一次英勇的争取，革命会倒向胜利的一边。他们了解自己的祖国墨西哥。革命一旦爆发，星星之火便可以燎原。迪亚斯政权就会像纸牌屋一样垮塌。在边境，起义工作已准备就绪。一声令下，一个美国人就会率领一百名世界产业工人联合会的会员越过边境前去攻打下加利福尼亚。可是，他们需要一些枪支。纵跨大西洋，委员会跟美墨边境的相关人士保持着联系，他们也需要枪支——冒险家、雇佣兵、土匪、心怀不满的美国工会会员、社会主义者、无政府主义者、恶棍、墨西哥流亡者、挣脱枷锁的苦役，以及受尽鞭打，从柯达伦和科罗拉多的牢笼里逃出来的渴望参与战斗的矿工——这是些流离失所、生活无望的人，被当今错综复杂的世界所抛弃。枪支弹药！枪支弹药！他们无休无止地索求着这些武装。

只要让这支人员复杂、境况潦倒、复仇心切的队伍冲过边境，革命的大幕就拉开了。海关及北部的港口会一一被攻占，迪亚斯想拦也拦不住。鉴于必须守住南方，他不敢抽调精锐部队前来阻击。而在南方也会遍地烽火，人们会揭竿而起。他的防御会一个城池接一个城池地崩溃，他的政权将一个州接一个州地垮台。最终，高歌猛进的革命军会将墨西哥城——迪亚斯的最后一个据点围得水泄不通。

可当务之急，委员会需要的是钱。他们有人——有迫不及待地渴望拿起武器战斗的人。他们也认识枪械商，那些人愿意卖枪给他们，并会负责把枪运来。只可惜由于酝酿革命，委员会已经资财耗尽，花光了最后一美元，爱国者们囊空如洗，饿着肚子度日，革命的天平在摇摆不定。必须弄到枪支弹药！必须把这些来自五湖四海的队伍武装起来！可是，怎么做到这一点？拉莫斯哀叹道他的财产已被政府没收；阿莱兰诺悔不该少年时挥金如土，家财荡尽；梅·赛斯比觉得委员会如果在过去精打细算，也不至如此。

“想想吧，墨西哥能不能获得自由，居然要取决于区区的几千美元！”保利诺·维拉说道。

绝望蒙在了每个人的脸上。他们本来把最后的希望都寄托在了乔斯·阿马利诺身上，他最近才加入委员会，答应拿出钱来，可是他在奇瓦瓦的自家庄园不幸被捕，在他家的马厩墙边被枪毙了。这个消息是刚刚才传来的。

当时利维拉正跪在地上擦地板，听到这种情况，不由抬起了头，手里拿着刷子，两只光膀子上沾满了肥皂沫和脏水。

“五千块够不够？”他问道。

大家眼里露出了惊讶的神情。维拉点了点头，咽了口唾沫。他一时说不出话来，可就在这一瞬间他的心里升腾起了希望。

“下订单购枪吧。”利维拉说。接着，他面露愧色地又说了一通话——大家以前从未听他说过如此多的话。“时间紧迫。三个星期之内我就把五千美元拿来。这样反倒好。那时天气会暖和些，利于冲锋陷阵。我也只能做到这些了。”

维拉不敢抱太大的指望。这实在匪夷所思！自从他参加革命活动以来，不知有多少美好的愿望终成泡影。他相信这个破衣烂衫的革命勤杂工的承诺，现在却有点拿不定主意。

“你疯了吧。”他说。

“三个星期之内把钱拿来，”利维拉说，“下订单购枪吧。”

随后，他站起身，将卷起的袖子放下，穿上了外套。

“下订单购枪吧，”他说道，“我这就去想办法。”

一阵忙乱之后，打了许多电话，骂了许多脏话，凯利的事务所在晚上开了个会。凯利为生意上的事忙得不可开交，运气老是不好。他把丹尼·沃德从纽约请来，安排好了他跟比利·卡瑟的拳击赛，日期定在三个星期之后，不料卡瑟受了重伤，已经躺了两天，这件事他小心地瞒着体育记者。一时找不到个选手代替卡瑟上场。凯利差不多给东部的每一个有资格参赛的轻量级拳击手都发了电报，可那些人都签了合同，忙得抽不开身来。眼前倒是出现了一线希望，只是这希望有点渺茫。

“你简直是吃了熊心豹子胆了。”凯利见到利维拉，看了他一眼，劈头盖脸便来了这么一句。

利维拉眼里满是深仇大恨，脸上却不动声色。

“我能打败沃德。”他只说了这么一句。

“你怎么知道能打败他？你看过他的比赛吗？”

利维拉摇了摇头。

“他就是闭上眼睛，用一只手出拳也能打败你。”

利维拉耸了耸肩膀。

“对这你有什么可说的？”拳击事务所的老板大声问道。

“反正我能打败他。”

“你跟什么人交过手？”迈克尔在一旁问道。他是凯利的哥哥，经营着黄石赌场，靠拳击赛赚得盆满钵溢。

利维拉只是冷冷地瞪了他一眼，没有回答。

拳击事务所老板的秘书是个穿着很花哨的小伙子，见状不由轻蔑地哼了一声。

“哦，你和罗伯兹是熟人，”凯利打破了这充满敌意的沉寂，开口说道，“他马上就来。我派人去叫他了。坐下来等一会儿吧。从你的外表看来，你是完全没有胜算的。我可不能让这场比赛出洋相，坏了观众们的兴致。前排的座位一张票就卖十五美元，这你是知道的。”

后来，罗伯兹出现了，显然带着几分醉意。他是个瘦高个，慢慢吞吞的，无论是言谈还是举止都不慌不忙、懒懒散散。

凯利直截了当地说道：

“喂，罗伯兹，你自诩慧眼发现了这个墨西哥小屁孩。你知道，卡瑟的胳膊断了。这个面黄肌瘦的小家伙找上门来毛遂自荐，说他能代替卡瑟上场。你觉得怎么样？”

“这挺好的，凯利，”罗伯兹慢条斯理地回答道，“他可以打得很漂亮。”

“想来你接下来会说他能打败沃德喽。”凯利很快地顶了他一句。

罗伯兹沉吟良久，末了说道：

“不，我不会说这话的。沃德是一流拳击手，是拳王。不过，他一时半会儿是打不垮利维拉的。我了解利维拉，谁都别想叫他乱阵脚。我从未见他惊慌失措过。他善于使双拳，能够左右开弓，一个冷不防就可以将对手放翻。”

“开不开弓倒没什么关系。关键是，他能不能打出些名堂来？你这一辈子一直在培养和训练拳击手，你的眼力我是很欣赏的。他究竟能不能让观众觉得自己没有花冤枉钱？”

“他一定不会让观众失望的。他会让沃德饱尝一顿苦头。你不了解这个小伙子，而我了解。是我发现了他。他可不是任人宰割的羔羊，而是个魔鬼。如果有人问起，你也可以说他是个复仇天使。他的拳路神出鬼没，会叫沃德眼花缭乱，你们大家看了也会眼花缭乱的。我不敢断言他定能打败沃德，但他一定会叫你们大开眼界，让你们知道他不愧为后起之秀。”

“就这样吧，”凯利转过脸对他的秘书说，“你给沃德打个电话。我已经给他打过招呼了，说安排好就请他出场。他就在黄石赌场对面，此时正在对着媒体秀肌肉，出风头呢。”

凯利交代完，又回过头来对罗伯兹说：“喝一杯，怎么样？”

罗伯兹一边慢慢喝着掺了苏打水的威士忌，一边讲起了他发现人才的经历。

“我还没跟你说我是怎么发现这个年轻人的呢。话说几年前，他跑到了教练场来。当时我正在训练普雷恩，让他准备迎战德莱尼。普雷恩下手狠毒，对陪练员残酷无情，所以弄得我找不到愿意跟他合作的人。就在这时，我注意到了这个饿得半死的墨西哥年轻人，一时顾不了许多，便一把揪住他，给他戴上拳击手套，让他进场。他比生牛皮还结实，就是没气力，对拳击方面的事情一窍不通。普雷恩打得他一佛出世，二佛升天。他咬紧牙坚持了两局，最后还是昏了过去。全是因为饥饿过度，被打趴下了。他惨得都叫人认不出来了。我给了他半美元的辛苦费和一顿饱饭。他已经有两天粒米未进了，吃饭狼吞虎咽，你真该看看他的那种吃相。我心想他不会再来了。谁料，他第二天又跑了来，虽然身体僵硬、酸痛，还是想再挣半美元的辛苦钱和一顿饱饭。日子久了，他就打得好起来了。他简直天生就是当拳击手的料，顽强得令人无法想象。他残酷无情，冷得就像一块冰。自从跟他交往以来，他张口说过的话从没有超过十一个字。他只是埋头做事，从不多话。”

“我以前见过他，”那位秘书说，“他替你干过不少活。”

“有些名堂的拳击手都拿他练过手，”罗伯兹说，“他也从他们那儿获益匪浅。可以看得出，有些拳击手是打不过他的。不过，他的心思并不在这上面。我觉得他压根就不喜欢这一行。他只是擅长拳击，并靠此谋生而已。”

“最近几个月，他在小俱乐部里打过几场比赛。”凯利说。

“是的。不知道他为何那样做。好像是一时心血来潮吧。他一阵旋风般出场，把当地的那些小拳击手打得落花流水。他似乎缺钱，也赢了一些钱，只是在穿着上看不出来。他神出鬼没，没人知道他在干什么，也没人知道他把时间都花在了哪里。即便来拳击场干活，他也是来如风，去无影，一般都是活一干完就走人。有时候，他会一连几个星期不露面。有一点：他不听别人的劝告。他就像个摇钱树，如果有人当他的代理人，他肯定有钱赚，但是他压根不考虑。瞧着吧，你跟他谈条件，他肯定会坚持要现金的。”

话说到此处，丹尼·沃德来了，前呼后拥的，经理和教练也跟了来。他像一阵微风飘然而至，表情和蔼可亲，让人一见就喜欢。他见了大家好一阵寒暄，谈笑风生、妙语连珠，忽而莞尔一笑，忽而捧腹大笑。这是他为人处世的风格，虚情居多，真心则少，极会逢场作戏。他觉得在江湖上混，“热情”是最好的法宝。而在内心深处，他却是一个深思熟虑、冷血无情的拳击手，一个精明的生意人。其余的都是假面。那些了解他或者跟他谈过生意的人都说，一接触到金钱，他就会六亲不认、原形毕露。每逢谈生意，他必到现场，有人说他的经理完全是个傀儡，只是充当了他的传声筒。

利维拉则是两样。他的血管里流着印第安人和西班牙人的血液。只见他远远坐在一个角落里，一声不吭，一动不动，只有两个黑眼珠在转，看看这张脸，再瞧瞧那张脸，将一切都收入了眼帘。

“原来是这伙计，”丹尼一面说，一面用审视的眼光把他未来的对手上下打量了一番，“你好，老弟。”

利维拉眼里冒火，恶狠狠的，连理都没有理对方。他讨厌所有的美国佬，而这个美国佬更是叫他一见就恨得牙根痒痒——这种现象极为罕见。

“天呀！”丹尼对拳击事务所的老板半开玩笑地提出了抗议，“竟然找了个哑巴跟我交手。”大家哄堂大笑。待笑声平息后，他又继续挖苦说：“如果说这就是你们找来的精兵强将，那么，洛杉矶一定是人才匮乏了。你们是从哪家幼儿园把他找来的？”

“这小家伙并不简单，丹尼，听我的，”罗伯兹替利维拉圆场说，“他并不像表面看上去那么容易对付。”

“这场比赛的票都卖出去一半了，”凯利央求地说，“你必须出场跟他赛一赛了，丹尼。目前的情况也只能如此了。”

丹尼又看了一眼利维拉，目光漫不经心，显得很是轻蔑，然后叹了口气说：“那我就上场吧，拳头落得轻一点就是了。但愿他别一拳就给打死了。”

罗伯兹哼了声鼻子。

“还是谨慎一些为妙，”丹尼的经理警告道，“不了解对方的底细，就别轻易交手，免得生出些枝节来。”

“没关系，我会当心的，没什么了不起的，”丹尼微微一笑说，“一开始，我就悠着点，为了娱乐观众先慢慢奉陪着他。这样的表演打上十五局，最后来个撒手锏将他放翻，你看怎么样，凯利？”

“一言为定，”凯利回答说，“等你兑现承诺。”

“那就来谈生意吧。”丹尼说完停下来盘算了一番，然后才继续说了下去。“当然喽，跟上次和卡瑟的那场比赛一样，门票的六成半归我们。不过，这次拳击手之间的分成略有不同——我应该拿其中的八成。”他又转过来问他的经理道：“你看怎么样？”

经理点了点头。

“这样的分成，你明白吗？”凯利问利维拉。

利维拉摇了摇头。

“情况是这样的，”凯利解释道，“门票的六成半是分给拳击手的。你是个新手，又没有名气。你和丹尼之间分成，你拿两成，其余的八成归丹尼。这样公平合理，你说是吧，罗伯兹？”

“这是很公平的，利维拉，”罗伯兹赞同地说，“要知道，你现在还没有名气呢。”

“门票分成的六成半一共是多少钱？”利维拉问道。

“唔，也许五千块，也许可以多到八千块，”丹尼插嘴解释道，“大概就是这么个数目。分到你手里的大概有一千块到一千六百块。败在我这样的名将手下，还能赚到一些钱，是相当不错的了。这你还有什么可说的？”

利维拉的回答却惊得他们连气都喘不过来了。

“胜者拿全部的分成。”他斩钉截铁地说。

屋子里静悄悄的，掉根针在地上都能够听得见。

“这有点像欺负小孩，抢小孩的糖果。”丹尼的经理说。

丹尼摇了摇头。

“我在这一行混得时间太长了，”只听他说道，“在这里我并不想影射裁判或在场的任何一个人，也无心指责操纵比赛的人以及赛场上有时存在的猫腻，只想说这场比赛对我而言是划不来的。我打比赛不愿冒风险。谁知道会发生什么事呢。也许，我的胳膊会突然断了，或者被什么人下了药，谁都说不清。”说到这里，他摇了摇头，表情凝重。“不论输赢，我都拿八成。你说怎么样，墨西哥人？”

利维拉也摇了摇头。

丹尼火冒三丈，顿时露出了狰狞的面目。

“狗日的小兔崽子！我真想现在就揍你一顿，打得你满地找牙。”

罗伯兹身子一侧，挡在了两个势同水火的仇敌之间。

“胜者拿全部的分成。”利维拉阴沉着脸，把刚才的话又说了一遍。

“为什么非得如此呢？”丹尼问。

“因为我能打败你。”利维拉直截了当地回答。

丹尼摆出打架的架势，把外套脱下了一半。他的经理了解他，知道那只不过是吓唬人摆个花架子。由于众人劝解，外套最终并没有脱下来。此时他赢得了大家的同情，使得利维拉成了孤家寡人。

“给我听着，你这个小笨蛋，”凯利插嘴说，“你只不过是个无名小辈。我们知道你这几个月打过几场比赛，击败了当地的几个末流拳击手。可是，丹尼是一流的。这场比赛结束之后，下一场就是锦标赛，他将会成为冠军。而你仅仅是名不见经传的小辈，出了洛杉矶，就没有人知道你了。”

“这场比赛结束后，他们会知道的。”利维拉耸了耸肩说。

“你居然妄想着能打败我？”丹尼忍不住插嘴说。

利维拉点了点头。

“得了吧，你也该理性一些，”凯利恳求道，“想想海报上该怎么说。”

“我需要这笔钱。”利维拉言简意赅地说。

“你八辈子也别想赢我。”丹尼语气坚定地说。

“那么你为什么不同意呢？”利维拉反唇相讥，“既然你轻易便能把钱赢到手，为什么不赢呢？”

“好吧，那我就给你点颜色看！”丹尼突下决心，高声喊道，“我要在台子上打死你，小兔崽子！你竟然敢挖苦我！凯利，你把这条件写下来吧——胜者拿全部的分成。把消息登在报纸的体育专栏里，就说这是一场复仇之战。我要让这个初出茅庐的小兔崽子领教一下我的厉害。”

凯利的秘书默默地记着，丹尼制止了他。

“等一下！”他转过来问利维拉：“体重怎么个称法呢？”

“上台前称。”利维拉回答说。

“那是绝对不行的，小兔崽子。如果胜者拿全部的分成，就得在上午十点钟称体重。”

“胜者拿全部的分成？”利维拉追问了一句。

丹尼点了点头，将此事敲定。他要在精力最饱满的时候上台比赛。

“那就在十点钟称体重。”利维拉说。

秘书的笔落下，继续写了起来。

“你比他要轻五磅呢，”罗伯兹向利维拉抱怨道，“这样，你就吃大亏了，必输无疑。丹尼壮得像头牛，肯定会打败你的。你这个傻瓜，恐怕你连一丁点儿取胜的希望都没有。”

利维拉没吱声，只是用充满仇恨的目光扫了他一眼。以前他总觉得罗伯兹在美国人当中算是最正直的一个，现在就连罗伯兹他也蔑视了。

利维拉上台的时候，几乎没有人注意。欢迎他的，只是稀稀拉拉的几声鼓掌，冷淡、勉强。没有观众相信他会赢，都觉得他只不过是一只落在强大的丹尼手中的待宰羔羊。另一方面，观众们感到有点失望。他们原本指望能看到丹尼·沃德和比利·卡瑟的激烈对决，而今却必须委屈自己，看这个初出茅庐的小孩子出洋相。还有，他们在丹尼身上押了二对一，甚至三对一的赌注，以此表示他们对这种变动的不满。观众下赌注，历来都是投在自己喜欢的选手身上。

这个墨西哥小子坐在他的那个角落里等待开场。时间在一分钟一分钟地被拖延着。丹尼故意让他等着，虽说是老把戏了，但用在初上场的新手身上却屡试不爽。新手傻坐在那里，焦虑油然而生，看着那些冷酷无情、吞云吐雾的观众，心里的恐惧感会一点点增加。但这一次，这种老把戏却失败了。罗伯兹说得对，利维拉可不是好对付的。他比任何一个选手都从容不迫、泰然自若，比任何一个选手都有胆量，压根就没有慌乱的迹象。连他自己的那个角落里也弥漫着他必败的气息，可这些对他毫无影响。他的助手是几个素不相识的美国佬，都是些窝囊废，拳击赛上的不得志者，既无尊严又无本事。他们一个个垂头丧气，铁了心认为他们这一方必输无疑。

“现在你可要当心点，”领头的助手斯巴德·哈格蒂提醒他说，“凯利交代过，让你尽量把时间拖长一些。要不然，媒体会大做文章，说这又是一场狗屁比赛，在洛杉矶抹黑这场比赛。”

当时的情况没有一样对利维拉是有利的，但他全然不当回事。他鄙视拳击赛，认为这是可恶的美国人搞的一种可恨的把戏。他初入此行，在训练场给别人当“剁肉的砧板”(3)，只是因为肚子饿的缘故。后来参加比赛取得了骄人的战绩，他也全然不当回事。他痛恨拳击比赛。直到加入了委员会以后，他才为了筹集资金乐于与人交手，因为他觉得这样挣钱比较容易。按说，在自己厌恶的行业取得成功者，他并非第一人。

对于这场比赛，他没有考虑过多，只知道必须取胜，不允许有其他的后果。在他的身后有一种力量在推动着他，使他抱有必胜的信心，而这种力量是在场的观众做梦也想不到的。丹尼·沃德参加比赛是为了赚钱，因为钱能够使他在生活中顺风顺水。而利维拉则是为了一种在心里熊熊燃烧的愿望和可怕的幻象。此刻，他孤单单地坐在赛台的角落里，眼睛睁得大大的，一面等着他的那个诡计多端的对手，一面清清楚楚看到了一幕幕幻象，就好像是他已经亲身经历过此时此刻。

他看见了粉墙围起的里奥布兰科(4)水力发电站；看见了发电站的六千个工人，一个个忍饥挨饿、满脸菜色，其中有七八岁的童工，每天要干很长时间的活，却只能挣十美分；看见了脸色惨白如死人一般的染坊里的工人，记起曾听父亲把这种染房叫作“自杀洞”，进去做一年工就会死掉；看见了他家的那个小庭院，母亲在那里煮饭和操持繁重的家务，还会抽空跑过来搂搂他、亲亲他；看见了他那大胡子、虎背熊腰的父亲——天下最慈爱的父亲，他心胸开阔，爱所有的人，心里充溢着对母亲以及在庭院墙角玩耍的小家伙们的爱。想当年，他的姓名并不是菲力普·利维拉，而是随父母的姓费尔南德斯，名叫胡安。后来，他自己把姓名改了，因为他发现费尔南德斯是那些警察局长和宪兵所痛恨的姓。

魁梧的、好心肠的华金·费尔南德斯父亲呀！这位父亲在利维拉看到的幻象里占有重要的位置。当年，利维拉并不了解自己的父亲，后来回忆往事，才对父亲产生了深刻的理解。他仿佛看见父亲在那个小印刷所里排文字，看见他趴在堆满杂物的桌子旁奋笔疾书，写下一行行充满激情的文字；看见工人们在天黑的时候借着夜色摸到他家来，偷偷摸摸的，像干什么坏事似的，跟他的父亲促膝交谈，谈上很长时间，而他这个少不更事的孩子则躺在角落里，时常偷听他们的谈话。

此时，斯巴德·哈格蒂的话似从很远的地方飘了过来：“千万不要一开局就被打趴下。这是老板的命令。挨打就挨打，坚持住，最后才能有点钱挣。”

时间过去十分钟了，他仍坐在他的那个角落里，还是不见丹尼的身影——看来，丹尼要把他的那套鬼把戏玩到极致。

利维拉记忆的长河开了闸门，往事如河水涌现而来。那一次，里奥布兰科的工人为了声援在普埃布拉(5)举行罢工的兄弟们，自己也举行了罢工，或者说是老板不愿满足工人们的要求而导致了停工。工人们饥饿难忍，纷纷进山找野果、树根和野菜充饥，结果吃得肚子疼，胃如刀绞。接着，噩梦接踵而至——就在公司仓库门前的空地上，成千上万饥饿的工人遭到枪击。罗萨里奥·马蒂尼兹将军率领迪亚斯的军队对工人大开杀戒，枪口不停喷出死亡的火焰，似乎永远也不会停止似的，工人血流成河，仿佛只有用鲜血才能洗刷掉这些工人所造下的“罪孽”。那是一个多么可怕的夜晚啊！他看见一辆辆敞篷车上，遇害工人的尸体堆积如山，准备运往韦拉克鲁斯(6)，抛进海里喂鲨鱼。他爬到恐怖的死人堆上，寻呀找呀，终于找见了他的父母，发现他们被剥光了衣服，浑身血肉模糊。母亲当时的样子他记得尤其清楚——母亲被几十具尸体压在底下，只露出来一张脸。耳边又响起了迪亚斯士兵的枪声，他急忙跳到地上，就像一只遭到猎人追赶的幼兽一样跑掉了。

正在遐想之际，他的耳边响起了山呼海啸般的欢呼声，只见丹尼·沃德在一群训练员和助手的簇拥下从中央通道正走过来。全场观众为之沸腾，热烈欢迎他们这位必胜无疑的英雄。人们一边倒，都拥护他、赞美他。当他得意扬扬地钻过绳子走上比赛台时，就连利维拉的助手也兴奋了起来，甚至说见到他有点高兴。他脸上挂着永不消失的招牌式微笑，笑啊笑的，鼻子、眼全在笑，就连眼角的鱼尾纹和眼珠子都在笑。如此和蔼可亲的拳击手，你就是找遍天下恐怕也找不到第二个。他的脸仿佛就是一幅宣扬善心和友谊的流动广告牌。他好像跟所有的人都认识，隔着绳子和他的朋友们说笑，打招呼。那些坐得远一点的，也都抑制不住崇拜的心情，高声喊着：“你好，丹尼！”这一充溢着欢快气氛的欢迎式足足持续了五分钟。

利维拉被冷落在那里，观众谁也不去注意他，仿佛他不存在似的。斯巴德·哈格蒂俯下身子，把他那张浮肿的脸凑到利维拉的跟前说：“别害怕。记住老板的命令，必须挺住，万不可倒下去。假如你倒下去，我们奉命在身，非得在更衣室里揍死你不可。明白吗？你必须拼死一搏。”

比赛场响起了雷鸣般的掌声。但见丹尼横穿台子朝着利维拉走了过来。他弯下腰，用双手握住利维拉的右手，热忱地摇了几下，把他那张笑开了花的脸和利维拉的脸贴得很近。他落落大方的运动员风范赢得了观众阵阵的喝彩——他向对手表现出的是兄弟般的友谊。随后，他的嘴唇动了几下，观众听不见他说的是什么，都以为他在善意地鼓励对方，于是又是一阵喝彩。只有利维拉听见了他那张挂满了笑容的嘴压低声音恶狠狠地说出的话：

“你这个墨西哥小兔崽子，我要把你的屎都打出来。”

利维拉纹丝不动，他甚至都没有站起来，只是用眼神表达着内心的仇恨。

“站起来，你这条狗！”身后有个人隔着绳子喊道。

观众嫌他缺乏运动员的风度，发出了一阵嘘声，可他依旧一动不动。丹尼穿过台子回到自己的角落时，人群又爆发出了欢呼喝彩声。

丹尼一脱下衣服，便引来了一片兴奋的赞叹声。他的身体堪称完美，柔韧性十足，强健而有力，显得精神抖擞，皮肤白嫩、细腻，跟女人一样。动作优雅，富于弹性，拥有强大的力量。他前后参赛几十场，已展示了自己的虎威。几乎所有的体育杂志都刊登过他的照片。

而斯巴德·哈格蒂扒下利维拉的套头毛衣时，听到的则是一片嘘声。由于皮肤黝黑，利维拉显得很瘦。他也有肌肉，但是和对手的肌肉相比，是不具可比性的。但观众疏于观察，看不到他厚实的胸膛，也想象不到他那肌肉的纤维是何等坚韧，想象不到那肌肉瞬间会产生怎样的爆发力，不知道他身体的每一个部分都受到精密的神经系统的操纵，可以在赛场上将他变为一台出色的战斗机器。在观众的眼里，他只是一个棕色皮肤的十八岁的年轻人，一副孩子似的身材。丹尼则完全不同，他是一个二十四岁的男子汉，呈现的是成年人的身材。裁判一声令下，二人走到台子中央，站在一起，这时这种对比就更加鲜明了。

利维拉注意到罗伯兹就坐在报社记者的背后，好像比平日醉得还厉害，舌头僵硬，说话更慢了。

“你可别乱了方寸，利维拉，”罗伯兹慢声慢调地说，“他打不死你，记住就是了。一开始，他会猛攻猛打，你可别乱了阵脚。你只需稳住阵脚，扭住他，由他打吧，反正也要不了你的性命。你就权当自己是训练场上的陪练员，挨几下打怕什么。”

利维拉就像是没听见似的。

“这个小东西老是阴沉着脸，”罗伯兹对坐在他旁边的一个男子嘟哝了一句，“对人总是爱答不理的。”

利维拉沉浸在回忆中，面无表情，没有显露出往常的那种仇恨神色。他眼睛里只看得到无数的来复枪——一眼望去，从跟前一直到贵宾席，观众的每一张面孔都幻化成了一支来复枪。接着，他又看见了漫长的墨西哥边境，那儿寸草不生，烈日当空，热得难受，聚集着一群群衣衫褴褛的人，眼巴巴盼望着拿到枪支。

他回到自己的那个角落，站在那儿等待着。他的助手钻过绳子下了台子，顺手将帆布矮凳也拿了下去。在四方形的拳击台的对角，丹尼正虎视眈眈地看着他。锣声一响，战斗拉开了序幕。观众高兴得大呼小叫。他们从未见过如此激动人心的序幕。报纸上说得很对：这是一场复仇之战。丹尼求战心切，三步两步就蹿过了四分之三的距离，恨不得一口将这个墨西哥小屁孩吞进肚里。他左一拳右一拳，不知打了多少拳，双臂挥动如飞轮在转，大有摧枯拉朽的架势。利维拉无处躲藏，全无招架之功，被那位拳坛老将从四面八方打来的暴风骤雨般的拳头所淹没。他立脚不稳，被打得靠在了绳子上，裁判将他们分开，紧接着又被打得靠在了上面。

这不像是拳击赛，简直就是杀戮，一场血腥的屠杀。任何观众，特别是那些下赌注的人，一开局就激动到了极点。丹尼的确拿出了看家本事，表现出了他的八面威风。可能是因为太笃信丹尼，太兴奋，太偏心眼，观众居然没注意到那个墨西哥人依然挺立着，没有倒下。他们已经忘记了利维拉的存在，因为丹尼攻势凌厉，铺天盖地的拳头把他遮了个严实，几乎看不见他。一分钟过去了，两分钟过去了。裁判把两个拳击手分开时，观众才看清楚了那个墨西哥人——只见他嘴唇被打得裂开，鼻子流血不止。利维拉转过身，踉踉跄跄走上前，又和对手扭打在了一起，脊背由于紧靠绳子，上面出现了一道道血印，直朝外渗血。可是观众没有注意到他的胸脯没有一起一伏，没注意到他的眼里仍有蓝色的火焰在燃烧。过去在训练场的残酷战斗里，不知有多少雄心勃勃的拳击手都在他身上练习过这种凌厉的攻击。为了能挣到每次半美元到一星期十五美元的钱，他每次都咬牙挺了过来，并从中学到了本事。训练场就是一座严酷的学校，他在那里受到了严酷的训练。

接下来，惊人的一幕发生了。快如旋风、令人眼花缭乱的战斗戛然而止，利维拉仍站在那里，英勇无敌的丹尼却仰面朝天倒在了地上。就在他慢慢恢复知觉时，全身抖如筛糠。他刚才倒下时，不是摇晃了几下才倒下去的，也不是慢慢瘫倒的。利维拉一记右勾拳以雷霆万钧之势砸过来，打得他直挺挺地倒在了地上。裁判将利维拉推开，站在那位倒在尘埃里的英雄身旁开始数数。在赛场上，看见这种一拳便将对手打翻在地的场面，观众一般都会满场喝彩。可是，此时的观众席无人喝彩。出现这样的场面，太出乎人的意料了。所有的观众都在看着裁判数数，气氛紧张，鸦雀无声。突然，罗伯兹兴高采烈的一声喊打破了沉寂：

“我早就说过他是个能使双拳的拳击手！”

数到第五秒时，丹尼翻了个身，面朝下，数到第七秒，他单膝跪起来，准备在数到九和十之间的时候站起来。假如在数到十的时候他的膝盖还没有离开地面，就算“输”或者“退出”。一旦膝盖离地，就算“站起”，利维拉便可以再次出拳将他打翻。利维拉一点也不敢马虎大意，时刻准备着要在他的膝盖离地之际扑上前去。他围着丹尼逡巡，但裁判也围着转，挡在他们俩之间。利维拉发现裁判数数时数得很慢，所有的美国佬都站在他的对立面，甚至包括裁判。

数到九的时候，裁判猛地把利维拉向后搡了一把。这样做有失公平，使得丹尼趁机站了起来。丹尼嘴角又露出了笑容，把腰弓得像虾米，用两只胳膊护住脸和腹部，狡猾地蹒跚着步子走上前扭抱他。按照比赛的规则，裁判员应该将他们分开，可裁判只是袖手旁观，于是丹尼就像狗皮膏药一样死死粘在利维拉的身上，借此一点—点地恢复元气。这一局的最后一分钟在飞快流逝。他只要坚持到底，就可以安全地回到自己的角落，在那里有整整一分钟的休息时间。结果他如愿撑到了最后，尽管狼狈不堪、境况悲惨，却仍笑容满面。

“瞧呀，他总是笑得那么开心！”有人高喊了一声。观众们总算松了口气，哄堂大笑起来。

“那个墨西哥小子刚才那一拳实在厉害。”当助手们围着他忙乱的时候，丹尼坐在自己的角落里，气喘吁吁地对顾问说。

第二局和第三局均无波无澜。丹尼是个狡猾无比的拳坛老将，一个劲躲闪、招架、坚持，一心要从第一局使得他头晕目眩的那一拳的打击中恢复过来。到了第四局，他恢复了过来。他虽说仍有点狼狈和惊诧，但由于体质好，已恢复了充沛的精力。不过，他不再采用那种咄咄逼人的战术了，因为他发现那个墨西哥小子原来是根难啃的骨头。他转而采用自己最擅长的打法，表现出他所精通的谋略、技巧和经验，虽然一招一式并不能产生重大战果，但科学有方，以期用疲劳战打垮对方。利维拉打他一拳，他会还三拳，但每一拳只是搔搔痒，形不成沉重打击。这样的拳头不知要挥多少次才可以产生真正的效果。眼前的这个初出茅庐的小子擅使双拳，速度快如闪电，左右开弓，叫他很是佩服。

在防御的时候，利维拉打的是一种干扰式的左直拳套路。他一次又一次以左直拳挡开丹尼的进攻，同时将拳头落在了丹尼的嘴和鼻子上。不过，丹尼很会随机应变，恐怕也正是因为如此，他才有望成为锦标赛的冠军。他可以随心所欲地改变战术，此刻正专注于近战。这种战术可谓神机妙算，可以叫他躲开对方左直拳的攻击。全场的观众兴奋地为他欢呼，声浪一波又一波。紧接着，他发动漂亮的进攻，对准那个墨西哥人的下颚来了记上勾拳，打得他双足腾空，跌落在垫子上。利维拉单膝跪地，尽量利用数数的时间休息。他心里很清楚，裁判给他数数是数得很快的。

到了第七局，丹尼又恶毒地打出了一记上勾拳，这次只是打得利维拉踉跄了几步，但他利用利维拉毫无防御能力的机会又补了一拳，将对方打到了台下。利维拉的身体朝着报社记者们的头上砸了过去，记者们一把将他推回到台子旁的绳子外。他单膝跪在那儿，而裁判在飞快地数秒数。丹尼在台子上等着他，而他必须钻过绳子上台迎战。这回，裁判没有干涉，没有把丹尼推开。

观众欢声雷动，高兴到了极点。

“打死他，丹尼，打死他！”一个声音高喊道。

此起彼伏的声音在大喊大叫，就像群狼在嗥叫。

丹尼在虎视眈眈地等候着。而利维拉不等数到九，裁判数到八的时候，就已经出乎意料地钻过绳子上了台，和丹尼扭打在了一起。这时裁判却出面干涉了，把他拉开，让他只有挨打的份儿——这个偏心眼的裁判让丹尼占尽了便宜。

可是，利维拉挺住了。他现在头脑清醒了起来，知道眼前的这些人全都是一丘之貉。这些可恨的美国佬，都是些偏心眼。在他感觉最艰难的时刻，那些幻象又一幕幕闪现在他的脑海里——长蛇一般的铁路线蜿蜒于茫茫沙漠上；墨西哥的宪兵和美国的警察；监狱和拘留所；水塔旁边的流浪汉——这些都是他离开里奥布兰科和那次罢工之后，一路漂泊所看到的种种肮脏和残酷的现实。随后，他仿佛看见蔚为壮观的红色革命浪潮席卷祖国大地，散发出耀眼的光芒。革命所需的枪支就在眼前。那些观众，每一张可恶的面孔就是一杆枪。他在为枪而战，赢了就有枪了，赢了就有革命了。他在为全体墨西哥人而战。

观众开始对利维拉感到不耐烦了，怨他不认输，不乖乖就范。既然注定要失败，为什么还要这么顽固呢？只有极少的人对他有兴趣——这些人在下赌注的人群里占有一定的比例，他们喜欢将一部分赌注压在希望渺茫的选手身上。他们相信丹尼会胜，可是他们仍然以四对十和一对三的比例，把钱押在这个墨西哥人身上。这时，有相当一部分观众下赌注，赌的是利维拉还能坚持几局。赛台边曾经有人下了大赌注，赌的是利维拉坚持不了七局，甚至连六局也坚持不下来。见自己下的赌注赚了，赢的一方就放下心来跟着大家一道喝彩，为自己赌赢的那一位加油。

利维拉硬是不服输。在第八局里，他的对手又打了个上勾拳，结果落了空。第九局，利维拉又一次叫全场观众惊得目瞪口呆。和对手扭打在一起时，他泥鳅一般迅速脱离开来，就在两人之间那么小的空间将右拳从腰部举起，将丹尼放翻在地，躺在那儿靠裁判数数挽救他的命运。人群一下子愣住了。谁能料想到丹尼竟被自己的拳法给打翻了。他那闻名遐迩的右手上勾拳居然“以其人之道还治其人之身”地落在了他自己的身上。裁判数到九时，他站了起来，利维拉按兵不动，没有向他发动攻击，因为裁判公开阻止他那样做。假如颠倒一下，要站起来的是利维拉，裁判就会站在一旁作壁上观了。

在第十局，利维拉两次将右拳从腰部举起，用上勾拳击打对方的下颚。丹尼拿出了拼命三郎的狠劲，脸上虽然仍旧笑意浓浓，却又一次如饿虎扑食般发起了凌厉攻势。他挥拳虎虎生风，然而却无法对利维拉造成伤害，利维拉顶住了他那令人眼花缭乱、迅雷不及掩耳的攻势，一连三次将他放倒在了垫子上。现在，丹尼恢复元气没有之前那么快了。到了第十一局，他的境况已经非常不佳。不过，他硬着头皮一直鏖战到第十四局，把他步入拳击生涯的看家本事都拿了出来。闪展腾挪，他努力保持体力，不随便浪费一丝力气。除此之外，他还拿出了作为一个功成名就的拳击手所熟知的见不得人的套路。凡是小诡计、小动作，他无所不用其极，在打贴身战时假装无意，把利维拉的手套夹在他的胳膊同身体之间，并且用他的手套顶住利维拉的嘴，堵得他不能呼吸。两人扭打在一起时，他不止一次从他那破裂却仍在微笑的嘴里冲着利维拉的耳朵吐出脏话，句句下流并带有侮辱性。在场的人，从裁判到观众，无一不站在丹尼的一边，无一不帮衬他。他们了解他的计划，知道他的战略部署。那个无名小辈虽然冷不防地出击，占了上风，但丹尼正在积蓄力量，准备一举扭转危局。他摆出甘愿挨打的架势，有时虚晃一拳，有时佯攻，有时诱敌深入，时刻在寻找有利的战机，瞅准机会使出全身力气一拳打去，让局面彻底逆转。他采用另一位比他更有名的拳击手的套路，左右开弓，用双拳直击利维拉的心窝和下巴。众人相信他能将对手打倒，因为他以力大而闻名——只要他能站稳脚跟，就一定能做得到。

利维拉的助手在两局之间的休息中，一点也不用心照料他。他们挥动毛巾只不过是装装样子，并没有把多少空气扇到他那气喘吁吁的肺里。斯巴德·哈格蒂为他提建议，但他充耳不闻，知道那是误人的话。所有的人都在跟他作对，四面八方都是阴谋诡计。在第十四局，他又将丹尼打翻在地，裁判员数数的时候，他就垂着双手站在那儿休息。从对面的角落里，他留意到有人在可疑地说着悄悄话。他看见迈克尔·凯利走到罗伯兹那儿，弯下腰跟他耳语。利维拉的耳朵在沙漠里经过锻炼，跟猫耳朵一样灵敏，听到了几句不连贯的话。他想多听一点，于是，对手站起来开战时，他便跟对手打贴身战，身子靠在绳子上。

“必须这样做，”他可以听见迈克尔如此说，而罗伯兹点了点头，“必须叫丹尼赢……我押了一大笔钱进去，输是输不起的……那可是我的血汗钱。假如他撑过了第十五局，我就会破产……那孩子听你的，你去给他吹吹风。”

自此，利维拉眼前的幻象彻底消失了，意识到那班人企图算计他。接着，他又一次把丹尼放翻，垂手站在那儿休息。只见罗伯兹站起来对他说道：

“回到你的角落里去，别在这儿等了。”

罗伯兹用的是命令口气，就像平时在训练场上对他说话一样。而他只是用仇恨的目光瞪了罗伯兹一眼，依旧站在原地等丹尼站起来。后来在一分钟的休息时间里，拳击事务所的老板凯利亲自走过来跟他说话。

“你可不要敬酒不吃吃罚酒，”他恶狠狠地用刺耳的声音低声说，“叫你倒下去你就倒下去，利维拉。按我的话做，我就会让你前途光明。下一次，一定叫你打败丹尼。这一次你必须倒下去。”

利维拉瞥了他一眼，表示自己听见了，然而却未置可否。

“你为什么不说话？”凯利生气地问。

“你早晚也是个输，”斯巴德·哈格蒂在一旁帮腔说，“裁判会叫你想赢也赢不了。乖乖地听凯利的话，倒下去得了。”

“求你倒下去吧，孩子，”凯利央求道，“回头我帮你获得锦标赛的冠军。”

利维拉没吱声。

“我一定会帮你的。这次就算你帮我了，孩子。”

锣声一响，利维拉感到有点不对头，觉得有什么事情要发生。观众却没有这种感觉。究竟是什么事情，不得而知，反正就在这赛台上，和他息息相关，而且近在眼前。丹尼似乎又恢复了先前的那种自信，气势汹汹地扑来，叫他心头一惊，预感到对方要耍诡计。丹尼猛冲，而他避免交锋，只是一步闪开，避开锋芒。对方想打贴身战，便于施展阴谋诡计。利维拉连连后退，绕个圈子躲开，但他心里清楚，对方迟早还会贴上来施展诡计。他索性一不做二不休，决定引蛇出洞。当丹尼再次冲过来时，他假装要打贴身战，可是眼看二人的身体就要贴在一起的时候，他却敏捷地猛然缩了回去。就在那一刹那，丹尼的那个角落里就传来了叫喊声，指责他犯规。裁判犹豫了一下，正要判利维拉犯规，可话到嘴边，却听见顶层楼座上有个男孩尖声喊道“有鬼”，便只好作罢。

丹尼公开地咒骂利维拉，向他步步紧逼，可是利维拉跳开了。利维拉决计不再近距离交战，这样会失去一半取胜的机会，但他知道如果想赢得比赛，只有靠远距离进攻一条路了。给那些人哪怕一丁点儿的机会，他们也会诬赖他犯规的。丹尼忘乎所以，在接下来的两局里见利维拉不敢近距离交战，就跟在后边穷追猛打。利维拉挨了一拳又一拳，挨了几十拳也不敢冒险上前打贴身战。观众见丹尼最后终于占了上风，都跳了起来狂呼乱喊。他们并不了解内幕，只看得见他们的明星最终稳操胜券。

“为什么不敢打啦？”观众愤怒地厉声喝问利维拉。“缩头乌龟！缩头乌龟！”“拿出本事来，你这个狗东西！拿出本事来！”“揍死他，丹尼！揍死他！”“别留情！揍死他！”

全场沸腾，唯有利维拉保持着头脑冷静。论性情和血气，他是最容易激动的人，但他经历过的场面，比这不知要激烈多少倍——眼前人群沸腾，声浪一浪高过一浪，对他来说，不过是夏天黄昏里凉爽的微风罢了。

到了第十七局，丹尼虎威不减。利维拉挨了重重一拳，被打得狼狈不堪，蔫了下来，两手无力地垂下，连连后退。丹尼觉得时机成熟，认为这个墨西哥小子已在他的股掌之上。殊不知这是利维拉的缓兵之计。利维拉骗他放松了警惕，果断出拳，一拳打在了他的嘴上，将他打翻在地。他一起来，利维拉出右拳向下一劈，砸在他的脖子和下颚上。利维拉连着打了三拳。这样的拳路，裁判不可能说是犯规的。

“比尔！比尔！求求你了！”凯利央求裁判判他犯规。

“没办法，”裁判痛惜地说，“找不到他的破绽。”

丹尼被打得半死，但英雄气不减，仍一次次地站起来。凯利和另外几个靠近赛台的人大声喊警察，让他们中止比赛，可是丹尼的阵营硬是不肯认输。利维拉看见那个胖警官笨拙地钻过绳子爬上赛台，弄不清这是在搞什么名堂。这场美国佬举办的拳击赛中能埋藏的诡计不知道还有多少。丹尼站在他前面，摇摇晃晃、东倒西歪，像喝醉了酒一样。裁判员和警官一齐过来，正要拉开利维拉时，他已经打下了最后一拳。用不着中止比赛了，因为丹尼再也站不起来了。

“数数呀！”利维拉嘶哑着声音对裁判吼道。

裁判数完了数，丹尼的助手过来将丹尼扶起，搀着他回到了他的角落。

“谁赢啦？”利维拉喝问道。

裁判十分不情愿地抓住他那只戴着手套的手，把它举了起来。

场上没有人向利维拉表示祝贺。他孤零零回到了他的角落里，他的助手连凳子也没有给他摆。他背靠在绳子上，用仇恨的目光看着他的助手们，然后将目光移向在场的一万名美国观众。他双膝发抖，精疲力竭地抽噎了几声。那些可憎的面孔在他眼前晃过来晃过去，使他感到头晕而恶心。他突然想起那些面孔就是枪支，现在他总算拿到了枪支。革命的车轮可以滚滚向前了。

To the Man on Trail


“Dump it in．”

“But I say，Kid，isn't that going it a little too strong？Whiskey and alcohol's bad enough；but when it comes to brandy and pepper sauce and—”

“Dump it in． Who's making this punch，anyway？”And Malemute Kid smiled benignantly through the clouds of steam． “By the time you've been in this country as long as I have，my son，and lived on rabbit tracks and salmon belly，you'll learn that Christmas comes only once per annum． And a Christmas without punch is sinking a hole to bedrock with nary a pay streak．”

“Stack up on that fer a high cyard，”approved Big Jim Belden，who had come down from his claim on Mazy May to spend Christmas，and who，as everyone knew，had been living the two months past on straight moose meat． “Hain't fergot the hooch we-uns made on the Tanana，hev yeh？”

“Well，I guess yes．Boys，it would have done your hearts good to see that whole tribe fighting drunk—and all because of a glorious ferment of sugar and sour dough．That was before your time，”Malemute Kid said as he turned to Stanley Prince，a young mining expert who had been in two years．“No white women in the country then，and Mason wanted to get married．Ruth's father was chief of the Tananas，and objected，like the rest of the tribe．Stiff？Why，I used my last pound of sugar；finest work in that line I ever did in my life．You should have seen the chase，down the river and across the portage．”

“But the squaw？”asked Louis Savoy，the tall French Canadian，becoming interested；for he had heard of this wild deed，when at Forty Mile the preceding winter．

Then Malemute Kid，who was a born raconteur，told the unvarnished tale of the Northland Lochinvar．More than one rough adventurer of the North felt his heartstrings draw closer，and experienced vague yearnings for the sunnier pastures of the Southland，where life promised something more than a barren struggle with cold and death．

“We struck the Yukon just behind the first ice run，”he concluded，“and the tribe only a quarter of an hour behind．But that saved us；for the second run broke the jam above and shut them out．When they finally got into Nuklukayet，the whole Post was ready for them．And as to the forgathering，ask Father Roubeau here：he performed the ceremony．”

The Jesuit took the pipe from his lips，but could only express his gratification with patriarchal smiles，while Protestant and Catholic vigorously applauded．

“By gar！”ejaculated Louis Savoy，who seemed overcome by the romance of it．“La petite squaw；mon Mason brav．By gar！”

Then，as the first tin cups of punch went round，Bettles the Unquenchable sprang to his feet and struck up his favorite drinking song：—

There's Henry Ward Beecher

And Sunday-school teachers，

All drink of the sassafras root；

But you bet all the same，

If it had its right name，

It's the juice of the forbidden fruit．



Oh the juice of the forbidden fruit，

roared out the Bacchanalian chorus，

Oh the juice of the forbidden fruit：

But you bet all the same，

If it had its right name，

It's the juice of the forbidden fruit．

Malemute Kid's frightful concoction did its work；the men of the camps and trails unbent in its genial glow，and jest and song and tales of past adventure went round the board．Aliens from a dozen lands，they toasted each and all．It was the Englishman，Prince，who pledged “Uncle Sam，the precocious infant of the New World；”the Yankee，Bettles，who drank to “The Queen，God bless her；”and together，Savoy and Meyers，the German trader，clanged their cups to Alsace and Lorraine．

Then Malemute Kid arose，cup in hand，and glanced at the greased-paper window，where the frost stood full three inches thick．“A health to the man on trail this night；may his grub hold out；may his dogs keep their legs；may his matches never miss fire．”




Crack！Crack！—they heard the familiar music of the dogwhip，the whining howl of the Malemutes，and the crunch of a sled as it drew up to the cabin．Conversation languished while they waited the issue．

“An old-timer；cares for his dogs and then himself，”whispered Malemute Kid to Prince，as they listened to the snapping jaws and the wolfish snarls and yelps of pain which proclaimed to their practiced ears that the stranger was beating back their dogs while he fed his own．

Then came the expected knock，sharp and confident，and the stranger entered．Dazzled by the light，he hesitated a moment at the door，giving to all a chance for scrutiny．He was a striking personage，and a most picturesque one，in his Arctic dress of wool and fur．Standing six foot two or three，with proportionate breadth of shoulders and depth of chest，his smooth-shaven face nipped by the cold to a gleaming pink，his long lashes and eyebrows white with ice，and the ear and neck ☆aps of his great wolfskin cap loosely raised，he seemed，of a verity，the Frost King，just stepped in out of the night．Clasped outside his mackinaw jacket，a beaded belt held two large Colt's revolvers and a hunting-knife，while he carried，in addition to the inevitable dogwhip，a smokeless ri☆e of the largest bore and latest pattern．As he came forward，for all his step was firm and elastic，they could see that fatigue bore heavily upon him．

An awkward silence had fallen，but his hearty “What cheer，my lads？”put them quickly at ease，and the next instant Malemute Kid and he had gripped hands．Though they had never met，each had heard of the other，and the recognition was mutual．A sweeping introduction and a mug of punch were forced upon him before he could explain his errand．

“How long since that basket-sled，with three men and eight dogs，passed？”he asked．

“An even two days ahead．Are you after them？”

“Yes；my team．Run them off under my very nose，the cusses．I've gained two days on them already，—pick them up on the next run．”

“Reckon they'll show spunk？”asked Belden，in order to keep up the conversation，for Malemute Kid already had the coffee-pot on and was busily frying bacon and moose-meat．

The stranger significantly tapped his revolvers．

“When'd yeh leave Dawson？”

“Twelve o'clock．”

“Last night？”—as a matter of course．

“To-day．”

A murmur of surprise passed round the circle．And well it might；for it was just midnight，and seventy-five miles of rough river trail was not to be sneered at for a twelve hours' run．

The talk soon became impersonal，however，harking back to the trails of childhood．As the young stranger ate of the rude fare，Malemute Kid attentively studied his face．Nor was he long in deciding that it was fair，honest，and open，and that he liked it．Still youthful，the lines had been firmly traced by toil and hardship．Though genial in conversation，and mild when at rest，the blue eyes gave promise of the hard steel-glitter which comes when called into action，especially against odds．The heavy jaw and square-cut chin demonstrated rugged pertinacity and indomitability．Nor，though the attributes of the lion were there，was there wanting the certain softness，the hint of womanliness，which bespoke the emotional nature．

“So thet's how me an' the ol' woman got spliced，”said Belden，concluding the exciting tale of his courtship．“‘Here we be，Dad，’ sez she．‘An'may yeh be damned，’ sez he to her，an' then to me，‘Jim，yeh—yeh git outen them good duds o'yourn；I want a right peart slice o'thet forty acre ploughed 'fore dinner．’ An'then he turns on her an'sez，‘An'yeh，Sal；yeh sail inter them dishes．’ An'then he sort o'sniffled an'kissed her．An'I was thet happy，—but he seen me an'roars out，‘Yeh，Jim！’ An'yeh bet I dusted fer the barn．”

“Any kids waiting for you back in the States？”asked the stranger．

“Nope；Sal died 'fore any come．Thet's why I'm here．”Belden abstractedly began to light his pipe，which had failed to go out，and then brightened up with，“How ’bout yerself，stranger，—married man？”

For reply，he opened his watch，slipped it from the thong which served for a chain，and passed it over．Belden picked up the slush-lamp，surveyed the inside of the case critically，and swearing admiringly to himself，handed it over to Louis Savoy．With numerous “By gars！”he finally surrendered it to Prince，and they noticed that his hands trembled and his eyes took on a peculiar softness．And so it passed from horny hand to horny hand—the pasted photograph of a woman，the clinging kind that such men fancy，with a babe at the breast．Those who had not yet seen the wonder were keen with curiosity；those who had，became silent and retrospective．They could face the pinch of famine，the grip of scurvy，or the quick death by field or flood；but the pictured semblance of a stranger woman and child made women and children of them all．

“Never have seen the youngster yet，—he's a boy，she says，and two years old，”said the stranger as he received the treasure back．A lingering moment he gazed upon it，then snapped the case and turned away，but not quick enough to hide the restrained rush of tears．

Malemute Kid led him to a bunk and bade him turn in．

“Call me at four sharp．Don't fail me，”were his last words，and a moment later he was breathing in the heaviness of exhausted sleep．

“By Jove！He's a plucky chap，”commented Prince．“Three hours' sleep after seventy-five miles with the dogs，and then the trail again．Who is he，Kid？”

“Jack Westondale．Been in going on three years，with nothing but the name of working like a horse，and any amount of bad luck to his credit．I never knew him，but Sitka Charley told me about him．”

“It seems hard that a man with a sweet young wife like his should be putting in his years in this God-forsaken hole，where every year counts two on the outside．”

“The trouble with him is clean grit and stubbornness．He's cleaned up twice with a stake，but lost it both times．”

Here the conversation was broken off by an uproar from Bettles，for the effect had begun to wear away．And soon the bleak years of monotonous grub and deadening toil were being forgotten in rough merriment．Malemute Kid alone seemed unable to lose himself，and cast many an anxious look at his watch．Once he put on his mittens and beaver-skin cap，and leaving the cabin，fell to rummaging about in the cache．

Nor could he wait the hour designated；for he was fifteen minutes ahead of time in rousing his guest．The young giant had stiffened badly，and brisk rubbing was necessary to bring him to his feet．He tottered painfully out of the cabin，to find his dogs harnessed and everything ready for the start．The company wished him good luck and a short chase，while Father Roubeau，hurriedly blessing him，led the stampede for the cabin；and small wonder，for it is not good to face seventy-four degrees below zero with naked ears and hands．

Malemute Kid saw him to the main trail，and there，gripping his hand heartily，gave him advice．

“You'll find a hundred pounds of salmon-eggs on the sled，”he said．“The dogs will go as far on that as with one hundred and fifty of fish，and you can't get dog food at Pelly，as you probably expected．”The stranger started，and his eyes flashed，but he did not interrupt．“You can't get an ounce of food for dog or man till you reach Five Fingers，and that's a stiff two hundred miles．Watch out for open water on the Thirty Mile River，and be sure you take the big cut-off above Laberge．”

“How did you know it？Surely the news can't be ahead of me already？”

“I don't know it；and what's more，I don't want to know it．But you never owned that team you're chasing．Sitka Charley sold it to them last spring．But he sized you up to me as square once，and I believe him．I've seen your face；I like it．And I've seen—why，damn you，hit the high places for salt water and that wife of yours，and—”Here the Kid unmittened and jerked out his sack．

“No；I don't need it，”and the tears froze on his cheeks as he convulsively gripped Malemute Kid's hand．

“Then don't spare the dogs；cut them out of the traces as fast as they drop；buy them，and think they're cheap at ten dollars a pound．You can get them at Five Fingers，Little Salmon，and the Hootalinqua．And watch out for wet feet，”was his parting advice．“Keep a-traveling up to twenty-five，but if it gets below that，build a fire and change your socks．”

Fifteen minutes had barely elapsed when the jingle of bells announced new arrivals．The door opened，and a mounted policeman of the Northwest Territory entered，followed by two half-breed dog-drivers．Like Westondale，they were heavily armed and showed signs of fatigue．The half-breeds had been born to the trail，and bore it easily；but the young policeman was badly exhausted．Still，the dogged obstinacy of his race held him to the pace he had set，and would hold him till he dropped in his tracks．

“When did Westondale pull out？”he asked．“He stopped here，didn't he？”This was supererogatory，for the tracks told their own tale too well．

Malemute Kid had caught Belden's eye，and he，scenting the wind，replied evasively，“A right peart while back．”

“Come，my man；speak up，”the policeman admonished．

“Yeh seem to want him right smart．Hez he ben gittin' cantankerous down Dawson way？”

“Held up Harry McFarland's for forty thousand；exchanged it at the P．C．store for a check on Seattle；and who's to stop the cashing of it if we don't overtake him？When did he pull out？”

Every eye suppressed its excitement，for Malemute Kid had given the cue，and the young officer encountered wooden faces on every hand．

Striding over to Prince，he put the question to him．Though it hurt him，gazing into the frank，earnest face of his fellow countryman，he replied inconsequentially on the state of the trail．

Then he espied Father Roubeau，who could not lie．“A quarter of an hour ago，”the priest answered；“but he had four hours' rest for himself and dogs．”

“Fifteen minutes' start，and he's fresh！My God！”The poor fellow staggered back，half fainting from exhaustion and disappointment，murmuring something about the run from Dawson in ten hours and the dogs being played out．

Malemute Kid forced a mug of punch upon him；then he turned for the door，ordering the dog-drivers to follow．But the warmth and promise of rest were too tempting，and they objected strenuously．The Kid was conversant with their French patois，and followed it anxiously．

They swore that the dogs were gone up；that Siwash and Babette would have to be shot before the first mile was covered；that the rest were almost as bad；and that it would be better for all hands to rest up．

“Lend me five dogs？”he asked，turning to Malemute Kid．

But the Kid shook his head．

“I'll sign a check on Captain Constantine for five thousand，—here's my papers，—I'm authorized to draw at my own discretion．”

Again the silent refusal．

“Then I'll requisition them in the name of the Queen．”

Smiling incredulously，the Kid glanced at his well-stocked arsenal，and the Englishman，realizing his impotency，turned for the door．But the dog-drivers still objecting，he whirled upon them fiercely，calling them women and curs．The swart face of the older half-breed flushed angrily，as he drew himself up and promised in good，round terms that he would travel his leader off his legs，and would then be delighted to plant him in the snow．

The young officer—and it required his whole will—walked steadily to the door，exhibiting a freshness he did not possess．But they all knew and appreciated his proud effort；nor could he veil the twinges of agony that shot across his face．Covered with frost，the dogs were curled up in the snow，and it was almost impossible to get them to their feet．The poor brutes whined under the stinging lash，for the dog-drivers were angry and cruel；not till Babette，the leader，was cut from the traces，could they break out the sled and get under way．

“A dirty scoundrel and a liar！”“By gar！him no good！”“A thief！”“Worse than an Indian！”It was evident that they were angry—first，at the way they had been deceived；and second，at the outraged ethics of the Northland，where honesty，above all，was man's prime jewel．“An'we gave the cuss a hand，after knowin' what he'd did．”All eyes were turned accusingly upon Malemute Kid，who rose from the corner where he had been making Babette comfortable，and silently emptied the bowl for a final round of punch．

“It's a cold night，boys，—a bitter cold night，”was the irrelevant commencement of his defense．“You've all traveled trail，and know what that stands for．Don't jump a dog when he's down．You've only heard one side．A whiter man than Jack Westondale never ate from the same pot nor stretched blanket with you or me．Last fall he gave his whole clean-up，forty thousand，to Joe Castrell，to buy in on Dominion．To-day he'd be a millionaire．But while he stayed behind at Circle City，taking care of his partner with the scurvy，what does Castrell do？Goes into McFarland's，jumps the limit，and drops the whole sack．Found him dead in the snow the next day．And poor Jack laying his plans to go out this winter to his wife and the boy he's never seen．You'll notice he took exactly what his partner lost，—forty thousand．Well，he's gone out；and what are you going to do about it？”

The Kid glanced round the circle of his judges，noted the softening of their faces，then raised his mug aloft．“So a health to the man on trail this night；may his grub hold out；may his dogs keep their legs；may his matches never miss fire．God prosper him；good luck go with him；and—”

“Confusion to the Mounted Police！”cried Bettles，to the crash of the empty cups．





An Odyssey of the North


I


The sleds were singing their eternal lament to the creaking of the harnesses and the tinkling bells of the leaders；but the men and dogs were tired and made no sound．The trail was heavy with new-fallen snow，and they had come far，and the runners，burdened with flint-like quarters of frozen moose，clung tenaciously to the unpacked surface and held back with a stubbornness almost human．Darkness was coming on，but there was no camp to pitch that night．The snow fell gently through the pulseless air，not in flakes，but in tiny frost crystals of delicate design．It was very warm，—barely ten below zero，—and the men did not mind．Meyers and Bettles had raised their ear-flaps，while Malemute Kid had even taken off his mittens．

The dogs had been fagged out early in the afternoon，but they now began to show new vigor．Among the more astute there was a certain restlessness，—an impatience at the restraint of the traces，an indecisive quickness of movement，a sniffing of snouts and pricking of ears．These became incensed at their more phlegmatic brothers，urging them on with numerous sly nips on their hinder-quarters．Those，thus chidden，also contracted and helped spread the contagion．At last，the leader of the foremost sled uttered a sharp whine of satisfaction，crouching lower in the snow and throwing himself against the collar．The rest followed suit．There was an ingathering of back-hands，a tightening of traces；the sleds leaped forward，and the men clung to the gee-poles，violently accelerating the uplift of their feet that they might escape going under the runners．The weariness of the day fell from them，and they whooped encouragement to the dogs．The animals responded with joyous yelps．They were swinging through the gathering darkness at a rattling gallop．

“Gee！Gee！”the men cried，each in turn，as their sleds abruptly left the main-trail，heeling over on single runners like luggers on the wind．

Then came a hundred yards' dash to the lighted parchment window，which told its own story of the home cabin，the roaring Yukon stove，and the steaming pots of tea．But the home cabin had been invaded．Three-score huskies chorused defiance，and as many furry forms precipitated themselves upon the dogs which drew the first sled．The door was flung open，and a man，clad in the scarlet tunic of the Northwest Police，waded knee-deep among the furious brutes，calmly and impartially dispensing soothing justice with the butt end of a dogwhip．After that，the men shook hands；and in this wise was Malemute Kid welcomed to his own cabin by a stranger．

Stanley Prince，who should have welcomed him，and who was responsible for the Yukon stove and hot tea aforementioned，was busy with his guests．There were a dozen or so of them，as nondescript a crowd as ever served the Queen in the enforcement of her laws or the delivery of her mails．They were of many breeds，but their common life had formed of them a certain type，—a lean and wiry type，with trail-hardened muscles，and sun-browned faces，and untroubled souls which gazed frankly forth，clear-eyed and steady．They drove the dogs of the Queen，wrought fear in the hearts of her enemies，ate of her meager fare，and were happy．They had seen life，and done deeds，and lived romances；but they did not know it．

And they were very much at home．Two of them were sprawled upon Malemute Kid's bunk，singing chansons which their French forbears sang in the days when first they entered the Northwest land and mated with its Indian women．Bettles' bunk had suffered a similar invasion，and three or four lusty voyageurs worked their toes among its blankets as they listened to the tale of one who had served on the boat brigade with Wolseley when he fought his way to Khartoum．And when he tired，a cowboy told of courts and kings and lords and ladies he had seen when Buffalo Bill toured the capitals of Europe．In a corner，two half-breeds，ancient comrades in a lost campaign，mended harnesses and talked of the days when the Northwest flamed with insurrection and Louis Reil was king．

Rough jests and rougher jokes went up and down，and great hazards by trail and river were spoken of in the light of com-monplaces，only to be recalled by virtue of some grain of humor or ludicrous happening．Prince was led away by these uncrowned heroes who had seen history made，who regarded the great and the romantic as but the ordinary and the incidental in the routine of life．He passed his precious tobacco among them with lavish disregard，and rusty chains of reminiscence were loosened，and forgotten odysseys resurrected for his especial benefit．

When conversation dropped and the travelers filled the last pipes and unlashed their tight-rolled sleeping-furs，Prince fell back upon his comrade for further information．

“Well，you know what the cowboy is，”Malemute Kid answered，beginning to unlace his moccasins；“and it's not hard to guess the British blood in his bed-partner．As for the rest，they're all children of the coureurs du bois，mingled with God knows how many other bloods．The two turning in by the door are the regulation ‘breeds’ or bois brules．That lad with the worsted breech scarf—notice his eyebrows and the turn of his jaw—shows a Scotchman wept in his mother's smoky tepee．And that handsome-looking fellow putting the capote under his head is a French half-breed，—you heard him talking；he doesn't like the two Indians turning in next to him．You see，when the ‘breeds’ rose under Reil the full-bloods kept the peace，and they've not lost much love for one another since．”

“But I say，what's that glum-looking fellow by the stove？I'll swear he can't talk English．He hasn't opened his mouth all night．”

“You're wrong．He knows English well enough．Did you follow his eyes when he listened？I did．But he's neither kith nor kin to the others．When they talked their own patois you could see he didn't understand．I've been wondering myself what he is．Let's find out．”

“Fire a couple of sticks into the stove！”Malemute Kid com-manded，raising his voice and looking squarely at the man in question．

He obeyed at once．

“Had discipline knocked into him somewhere，”Prince com-mented in a low tone．

Malemute Kid nodded，took off his socks，and picked his way among the recumbent men to the stove．There he hung his damp footgear among a score or so of mates．

“When do you expect to get to Dawson？”he asked tentatively．

The man studied him a moment before replying．“They say seventy-five mile．So？Maybe two days．”

The very slightest accent was perceptible，while there was no awkward hesitancy or groping for words．

“Been in the country before？”

“No．”

“Northwest Territory？”

“Yes．”

“Born there？”

“No．”

“Well，where the devil were you born？You're none of these．”Malemute Kid swept his hand over the dog-drivers，even including the two policemen who had turned into Prince's bunk．“Where did you come from？I've seen faces like yours before，though I can't remember just where．”

“I know you，”he irrelevantly replied，at once turning the drift of Malemute Kid's questions．

“Where？Ever see me？”

“No；your partner，him priest，Pastilik，long time ago．Him ask me if I see you，Malemute Kid．Him give me grub．I no stop long．You hear him speak 'bout me？”

“Oh！you're the fellow that traded the otter skins for the dogs？”

The man nodded，knocked out his pipe，and signified his disinclination for conversation by rolling up in his furs．Malemute Kid blew out the slush-lamp and crawled under the blankets with Prince．

“Well，what is he？”

“Don't know—turned me off，somehow，and then shut up like a clam．But he's a fellow to whet your curiosity．I've heard of him．All the coast wondered about him eight years ago．Sort of mysterious，you know．He came down out of the North，in the dead of winter，many a thousand miles from here，skirting Bering Sea and traveling as though the devil were after him．No one ever learned where he came from，but he must have come far．He was badly travel-worn when he got food from the Swedish missionary on Golovin Bay and asked the way south．We heard of this afterward．Then he abandoned the shore-line，heading right across Norton Sound．Terrible weather，snow-storms and high winds，but he pulled through where a thousand other men would have died，missing St．Michael's and making the land at Pastilik．He'd lost all but two dogs，and was nearly gone with starvation．

“He was so anxious to go on that Father Roubeau fitted him out with grub；but he couldn't let him have any dogs，for he was only waiting my arrival to go on a trip himself．Mr．Ulysses knew too much to start on without animals，and fretted around for several days．He had on his sled a bunch of beautifully cured otter skins，sea-otters，you know，worth their weight in gold．There was also at Pastilik an old Shylock of a Russian trader，who had dogs to kill．Well，they didn't dicker very long，but when the Strange One headed south again，it was in the rear of a spanking dog-team．Mr．Shylock，by the way，had the otter skins．I saw them，and they were magnificent．We figured it up and found the dogs brought him at least five hundred apiece．And it wasn't as if the Strange One didn't know the value of sea-otter；he was an Indian of some sort，and what little he talked showed he'd been among white men．

“After the ice passed out of the sea，word came up from Nunivak Island that he'd gone in there for grub．Then he dropped from sight，and this is the first heard of him in eight years．Now where did he come from？and what was he doing there？and why did he come from there？He's Indian，he's been nobody knows where，and he's had discipline，which is unusual for an Indian．Another mystery of the North for you to solve，Prince．”

“Thanks，awfully；but I've got too many on hand as it is，”he replied．

Malemute Kid was already breathing heavily；but the young mining engineer gazed straight up through the thick darkness，waiting for the strange orgasm which stirred his blood to die away．And when he did sleep，his brain worked on，and for the nonce he，too，wandered through the white unknown，struggled with the dogs on endless trails，and saw men live，and toil，and die like men．




The next morning，hours before daylight，the dog-drivers and policemen pulled out for Dawson．But the powers that saw to her Majesty's interests，and ruled the destinies of her lesser creatures，gave the mailmen little rest；for a week later they appeared at Stuart River，heavily burdened with letters for Salt Water．However，their dogs had been replaced by fresh ones；but then，they were dogs．

The men had expected some sort of a lay-over in which to rest up；besides，this Klondike was a new section of the Northland，and they had wished to see a little something of the Golden City where dust flowed like water，and dance halls rang with never ending revelry．But they dried their socks and smoked their evening pipes with much the same gusto as on their former visit，though one or two bold spirits speculated on desertion and the possibility of crossing the unexplored Rockies to the east，and thence，by the Mackenzie Valley，of gaining their old stamping-grounds in the Chippewyan Country．Two or three even decided to return to their homes by that route when their terms of service had expired，and they began to lay plans forthwith，looking forward to the hazardous undertaking in much the same way a city-bred man would to a day's holiday in the woods．

He of the Otter Skins seemed very restless，though he took little interest in the discussion，and at last he drew Malemute Kid to one side and talked for some time in low tones．Prince cast curious eyes in their direction，and the mystery deepened when they put on caps and mittens and went outside．When they returned，Malemute Kid placed his gold-scales on the table，weighed out the matter of sixty ounces，and transferred them to the Strange One's sack．Then the chief of the dog-drivers joined the conclave，and certain business was transacted with him．The next day the gang went on up river，but He of the Otter Skins took several pounds of grub and turned his steps back toward Dawson．




“Didn't know what to make of it，”said Malemute Kid in response to Prince's queries；“but the poor beggar wanted to be quit of the service for some reason or other—at least it seemed a most important one to him，though he wouldn't let on what．You see，it's just like the army；he signed for two years，and the only way to get free was to buy himself out．He couldn't desert and then stay here，and he was just wild to remain in the country．Made up his mind when he got to Dawson，he said；but no one knew him，hadn't a cent，and I was the only one he'd spoken two words with．So he talked it over with the Lieutenant-Governor，and made arrangements in case he could get the money from me—loan，you know．Said he'd pay back in the year，and if I wanted，would put me onto something rich．Never'd seen it，but knew it was rich．

“And talk！why，when he got me outside he was ready to weep．Begged and pleaded；got down in the snow to me till I hauled him out of it．Palavered around like a crazy man．Swore he's worked to this very end for years and years，and couldn't bear to be disappointed now．Asked him what end，but he wouldn't say．Said they might keep him on the other half of the trail and he wouldn't get to Dawson in two years，and then it would be too late．Never saw a man take on so in my life．And when I said I'd let him have it，had to yank him out of the snow again．Told him to consider it in the light of a grub-stake．Think he'd have it？No sir！Swore he'd give me all he found，make me rich beyond the dreams of avarice，and all such stuff．Now a man who puts his life and time against a grub-stake ordinarily finds it hard enough to turn over half of what he finds．Something behind all this，Prince；just you make a note of it．We'll hear of him if he stays in the country—”

“And if he doesn't？”

“Then my good nature gets a shock，and I'm sixty some odd ounces out．”




The cold weather had come on with the long nights，and the sun had begun to play his ancient game of peekaboo along the southern snow-line ere aught was heard of Malemute Kid's grub-stake．And then，one bleak morning in early January，a heavily laden dog-train pulled into his cabin below Stuart River．He of the Otter Skins was there，and with him walked a man such as the gods have almost forgotten how to fashion．Men never talked of luck and pluck and five-hundred-dollar dirt without bringing in the name of Axel Gunderson；nor could tales of nerve or strength or daring pass up and down the camp-fire without the summoning of his presence．And when the conversation flagged，it blazed anew at mention of the woman who shared his fortunes．

As has been noted，in the making of Axel Gunderson the gods had remembered their old-time cunning，and cast him after the manner of men who were born when the world was young．Full seven feet he towered in his picturesque costume which marked a king of Eldorado．His chest，neck，and limbs were those of a giant．To bear his three hundred pounds of bone and muscle，his snowshoes were greater by a generous yard than those of other men．Rough-hewn，with rugged brow and massive jaw and unflinching eyes of palest blue，his face told the tale of one who knew but the law of might．Of the yellow of ripe corn silk，his frost-incrusted hair swept like day across the night，and fell far down his coat of bear-skin．A vague tradition of the sea seemed to cling about him，as he swung down the narrow trail in advance of the dogs；and he brought the butt of his dog-whip against Malemute Kid's door as a Norse sea rover，on southern foray，might thunder for admittance at the castle gate．

Prince bared his womanly arms and kneaded sour-dough bread，casting，as he did so，many a glance at the three guests，—three guests the like of which might never come under a man's roof in a lifetime．The Strange One，whom Malemute Kid had surnamed Ulysses，still fascinated him；but his interest chiefly gravitated between Axel Gunderson and Axel Gunderson's wife．She felt the day's journey，for she had softened in comfortable cabins during the many days since her husband mastered the wealth of frozen pay-streaks，and she was tired．She rested against his great breast like a slender flower against a wall，replying lazily to Malemute Kid's good-natured banter，and stirring Prince's blood strangely with an occasional sweep of her deep，dark eyes．For Prince was a man，and healthy，and had seen few women in many months．And she was older than he，and an Indian besides．But she was different from all native wives he had met：she had traveled，—had been in his country among others，he gathered from the conversation；and she knew most of the things the women of his own race knew，and much more that it was not in the nature of things for them to know．She could make a meal of sun-dried fish or a bed in the snow；yet she teased them with tantalizing details of many-course dinners，and caused strange internal dissensions to arise at the mention of various quondam dishes which they had well-nigh forgotten．She knew the ways of the moose，the bear，and the little blue fox，and of the wild amphibians of the Northern seas；she was skilled in the lore of the woods and the streams，and the tale writ by man and bird and beast upon the delicate snow crust was to her an open book；yet Prince caught the appreciative twinkle in her eye as she read the Rules of the Camp．These rules had been fathered by the Unquenchable Bettles at a time when his blood ran high，and were remarkable for the terse simplicity of their humor．Prince always turned them to the wall before the arrival of ladies；but who could suspect that this native wife—Well，it was too late now．

This，then，was the wife of Axel Gunderson，a woman whose name and fame had traveled with her husband's，hand in hand，through all the Northland．At table，Malemute Kid baited her with the assurance of an old friend，and Prince shook off the shyness of first acquaintance and joined in．But she held her own in the unequal contest，while her husband，slower in wit，ventured naught but applause．And he was very proud of her；his every look and action revealed the magnitude of the place she occupied in his life．He of the Otter Skins ate in silence，forgotten in the merry battle；and long ere the others were done he pushed back from the table and went out among the dogs．Yet all too soon his fellow travelers drew on their mittens and parkas，and followed him．

There had been no snow for many days，and the sleds slipped along the hard-packed Yukon trail as easily as if it had been glare ice．Ulysses led the first sled；with the second came Prince and Axel Gunderson's wife；while Malemute Kid and the yellow-haired giant brought up the third．

“It's only a ‘hunch，’ Kid，”he said；“but I think it's straight．He's never been there，but he tells a good story，and shows a map I heard of when I was in the Kootenay country，years ago．I'd like to have you go along；but he's a strange one，and swore point-blank to throw it up if any one was brought in．But when I come back you'll get first tip，and I'll stake you next to me，and give you a half share in the town site besides．

“No！no！”he cried，as the other strove to interrupt．“I'm running this，and before I'm done it'll need two heads．If it's all right，why it'll be a second Cripple Creek，man；do you hear？—a second Cripple Creek！It's quartz，you know，not placer；and if we work it right we'll corral the whole thing，—millions upon millions．I've heard of the place before，and so have you．We'll build a town—thousands of workmen—good waterways—steamship lines—big carrying trade—light-draught steamers for head-reaches—survey a railroad，perhaps—sawmills—electric-light plant—do our own banking—commercial company—syndicate—Say！Just you hold your hush till I get back！”

The sleds came to a halt where the trail crossed the mouth of Stuart River．An unbroken sea of frost，its wide expanse stretched away into the unknown east．The snowshoes were withdrawn from the lashings of the sleds．Axel Gunderson shook hands and stepped to the fore，his great webbed shoes sinking a fair half yard into the feathery surface and packing the snow so the dogs should not wallow．His wife fell in behind the last sled，betraying long practice in the art of handling the awkward footgear．The stillness was broken with cheery farewells；the dogs whined；and He of the Otter Skins talked with his whip to a recalcitrant wheeler．

An hour later，the train had taken on the likeness of a black pencil crawling in a long，straight line across a mighty sheet of foolscap．





II


One night，many weeks later，Malemute Kid and Prince fell to solving chess problems from the torn page of an ancient magazine．The Kid had just returned from his Bonanza properties，and was resting up preparatory to a long moose hunt．Prince too had been on creek and trail nearly all winter，and had grown hungry for a blissful week of cabin life．

“Interpose the black knight，and force the king．No，that won't do．See，the next move—”

“Why advance the pawn two squares？Bound to take it in transit，and with the bishop out of the way—”

“But hold on！That leaves a hole，and—”

“No；it's protected．Go ahead！You'll see it works．”

It was very interesting．Somebody knocked at the door a second time before Malemute Kid said，“Come in．”The door swung open．Something staggered in．Prince caught one square look，and sprang to his feet．The horror in his eyes caused Malemute Kid to whirl about；and he too was startled，though he had seen bad things before．The thing tottered blindly toward them．Prince edged away till he reached the nail from which hung his Smith＆Wesson．

“My God！What is it？”he whispered to Malemute Kid．

“Don't know．Looks like a case of freezing and no grub，”replied the Kid，sliding away in the opposite direction．“Watch out！It may be mad，”he warned，coming back from closing the door．

The thing advanced to the table．The bright flame of the slush-lamp caught its eye．It was amused，and gave voice to eldritch cackles which betokened mirth．Then，suddenly，he—for it was a man—swayed back，with a hitch to his skin trousers，and began to sing a chanty，such as men lift when they swing around the capstan circle and the sea snorts in their ears：—

Yan-kee ship come down de ri-ib-er，

Pull！My bully boys！Pull！

D'yeh want—to know de captain ru-uns her？

Pull！My bully boys！Pull！

Jon-a-than Jones ob South Caho-li-in-a，

Pull！My bully—

He broke off abruptly，tottered with a wolfish snarl to the meat-shelf，and before they could intercept was tearing with his teeth at a chunk of raw bacon．The struggle was fierce between him and Malemute Kid；but his mad strength left him as suddenly as it had come，and he weakly surrendered the spoil．Between them they got him upon a stool，where he sprawled with half his body across the table．A small dose of whiskey strengthened him，so that he could dip a spoon into the sugar caddy which Malemute Kid placed before him．After his appetite had been somewhat cloyed，Prince，shuddering as he did so，passed him a mug of weak beef tea．

The creature's eyes were alight with a sombre frenzy，which blazed and waned with every mouthful．There was very little skin to the face．The face，for that matter，sunken and emaciated，bore very little likeness to human countenance．Frost after frost had bitten deeply，each depositing its stratum of scab upon the half-healed scar that went before．This dry，hard surface was of a bloody-black color，serrated by grievous cracks wherein the raw red flesh peeped forth．His skin garments were dirty and in tatters，and the fur of one side was singed and burned away，showing where he had lain upon his fire．

Malemute Kid pointed to where the sun-tanned hide had been cut away，strip by strip，—the grim signature of famine．“Who—are—you？”slowly and distinctly enunciated the Kid．

The man paid no heed．

“Where do you come from？”

“Yan-kee ship come down de ri-ib-er，”was the quavering response．

“Don't doubt the beggar came down the river，”the Kid said，shaking him in an endeavor to start a more lucid flow of talk．

But the man shrieked at the contact，clapping a hand to his side in evident pain．He rose slowly to his feet，half leaning on the table．

“She laughed at me—so—with the hate in her eye；and she—would—not—come．”

His voice died away，and he was sinking back when Malemute Kid gripped him by the wrist，and shouted，“Who？Who would not come？”

“She，Unga．She laughed，and struck at me，so，and so．And then—”

“Yes？”

“And then—”

“And then what？”

“And then he lay very still，in the snow，a long time．He is—still in—the—snow．”

The two men looked at each other helplessly．

“Who is in the snow？”

“She，Unga．She looked at me with the hate in her eye，and then—”

“Yes，yes．”

“And then she took the knife，so；and once，twice—she was weak．I traveled very slow．And there is much gold in that place，very much gold．”

“Where is Unga？”For all Malemute Kid knew，she might be dying a mile away．He shook the man savagely，repeating again and again，“Where is Unga？Who is Unga？”

“She—is—in—the—snow．”

“Go on！”The Kid was pressing his wrist cruelly．

“So—I—would—be—in—the—snow—but—I—had—a—debt—to—pay．It—was—heavy—I—had—a—debt—to—pay．I—had—”The faltering monosyllables ceased as he fumbled in his pouch and drew forth a buckskin sack．“A—debt—to—pay—five—pounds—of—gold—grub—stake—Mal—e—mute—Kid—I—”The exhausted head dropped upon the table；nor could Malemute Kid rouse it again．

“It's Ulysses，”he said quietly，tossing the bag of dust on the table．“Guess it's all day with Axel Gunderson and the woman．Come on，let's get him between the blankets．He's Indian；he'll pull through，and tell a tale besides．”

As they cut his garments from him，near his right breast could be seen two unhealed，hard-lipped knife thrusts．





III


“I will talk of the things which were in my own way；but you will understand．I will begin at the beginning，and tell of myself and the woman，and，after that，of the man．”

He of the Otter Skins drew over to the stove as do men who have been deprived of fire and are afraid the Promethean gift may vanish at any moment．Malemute Kid picked up the slush-lamp，and placed it so its light might fall upon the face of the narrator．Prince slid his body over the edge of the bunk and joined them．

“I am Naass，a chief，and the son of a chief，born between a sunset and a rising，on the dark seas，in my father's oomiak．All of a night the men toiled at the paddles，and the women cast out the waves which threw in upon us，and we fought with the storm．The salt spray froze upon my mother's breast till her breath passed with the passing of the tide．But I，—I raised my voice with the wind and the storm，and lived．

“We dwelt in Akatan—”

“Where？”asked Malemute Kid．

“Akatan，which is in the Aleutians；Akatan，beyond Chignik，beyond Kardalak，beyond Unimak．As I say，we dwelt in Akatan，which lies in the midst of the sea on the edge of the world．We farmed the salt seas for the fish，the seal，and the otter；and our homes shouldered about one another on the rocky strip between the rim of the forest and the yellow beach where our kayaks lay．We were not many，and the world was very small．There were strange lands to the east，—islands like Akatan；so we thought all the world was islands，and did not mind．

“I was different from my people．In the sands of the beach were the crooked timbers and wave-warped planks of a boat such as my people never built；and I remember on the point of the island which overlooked the ocean three ways there stood a pine tree which never grew there，smooth and straight and tall．It is said the two men came to that spot，turn about，through many days，and watched with the passing of the light．These two men came from out of the sea in the boat which lay in pieces on the beach．And they were white like you，and weak as the little children when the seal have gone away and the hunters come home empty．I know of these things from the old men and the old women，who got them from their fathers and mothers before them．These strange white men did not take kindly to our ways at first，but they grew strong，what of the fish and the oil，and fierce．And they built them each his own house，and took the pick of our women，and in time children came．Thus he was born who was to become the father of my father's father．

“As I said，I was different from my people，for I carried the strong，strange blood of this white man who came out of the sea．It is said we had other laws in the days before these men；but they were fierce and quarrelsome，and fought with our men till there were no more left who dared to fight．Then they made themselves chiefs，and took away our old laws and gave us new ones，insomuch that the man was the son of his father，and not his mother，as our way had been．They also ruled that the son，firstborn，should have all things which were his father's before him，and that the brothers and sisters should shift for themselves．And they gave us other laws．They showed us new ways in the catching of fish and the killing of bear which were thick in the woods；and they taught us to lay by bigger stores for the time of famine．And these things were good．

“But when they had become chiefs，and there were no more men to face their anger，they fought，these strange white men，each with the other．And the one whose blood I carry drove his seal spear the length of an arm through the other's body．Their children took up the fight，and their children's children；and there was great hatred between them，and black doings，even to my time，so that in each family but one lived to pass down the blood of them that went before．Of my blood I was alone；of the other man's there was but a girl．Unga，who lived with her mother．Her father and my father did not come back from the fishing one night；but afterward they washed up to the beach on the big tides，and they held very close to each other．

“The people wondered，because of the hatred between the houses，and the old men shook their heads and said the fight would go on when children were born to her and children to me．They told me this as a boy，till I came to believe，and to look upon Unga as a foe，who was to be the mother of children which were to fight with mine．I thought of these things day by day，and when I grew to a stripling I came to ask why this should be so．And they answered，‘We do not know，but that in such way your fathers did．’ And I marveled that those which were to come should fight the battles of those that were gone，and in it I could see no right．But the people said it must be，and I was only a stripling．

“And they said I must hurry，that my blood might be the older and grow strong before hers．This was easy，for I was head man，and the people looked up to me because of the deeds and the laws of my fathers，and the wealth which was mine．Any maiden would come to me，but I found none to my liking．And the old men and the mothers of maidens told me to hurry，for even then were the hunters bidding high to the mother of Unga；and should her children grow strong before mine，mine would surely die．

“Nor did I find a maiden till one night coming back from the fishing．The sunlight was lying，so，low and full in the eyes，the wind free，and the kayaks racing with the white seas．Of a sudden the kayak of Unga came driving past me，and she looked upon me，so，with her black hair flying like a cloud of night and the spray wet on her cheek．As I say，the sunlight was full in the eyes，and I was a stripling；but somehow it was all clear，and I knew it to be the call of kind to kind．As she whipped ahead she looked back within the space of two strokes，—looked as only the woman Unga could look，—and again I knew it as the call of kind．The people shouted as we ripped past the lazy oomiaks and left them far behind．But she was quick at the paddle，and my heart was like the belly of a sail，and I did not gain．The wind freshened，the sea whitened，and，leaping like the seals on the windward breech，we roared down the golden pathway of the sun．”

Naass was crouched half out of his stool，in the attitude of one driving a paddle，as he ran the race anew．Somewhere across the stove he beheld the tossing kayak and the flying hair of Unga．The voice of the wind was in his ears，and its salt beat fresh upon his nostrils．

“But she made the shore，and ran up the sand，laughing，to the house of her mother．And a great thought came to me that night，—a thought worthy of him that was chief over all the people of Akatan．So，when the moon was up，I went down to the house of her mother，and looked upon the goods of Yash-Noosh，which were piled by the door，—the goods of Yash-Noosh，a strong hunter who had it in mind to be the father of the children of Unga．Other young men had piled their goods there，and taken them away again；and each young man had made a pile greater than the one before．

“And I laughed to the moon and the stars，and went to my own house where my wealth was stored．And many trips I made，till my pile was greater by the fingers of one hand than the pile of Yash-Noosh．There were fish，dried in the sun and smoked；and forty hides of the hair seal，and half as many of the fur，and each hide was tied at the mouth and big-bellied with oil；and ten skins of bear which I killed in the woods when they came out in the spring．And there were beads and blankets and scarlet cloths，such as I got in trade from the people who lived to the east，and who got them in trade from the people who lived still beyond in the east．And I looked upon the pile of Yash-Noosh and laughed；for I was head man in Akatan，and my wealth was greater than the wealth of all my young men，and my fathers had done deeds，and given laws，and put their names for all time in the mouths of the people．

“So，when the morning came，I went down to the beach，casting out of the corner of my eye at the house of the mother of Unga．My offer yet stood untouched．And the women smiled，and said sly things one to the other．I wondered，for never had such a price been offered；and that night I added more to the pile，and put beside it a kayak of well-tanned skins which never yet had swam in the sea．But in the day it was yet there，open to the laughter of all men．The mother of Unga was crafty，and I grew angry at the shame in which I stood before my people．So that night I added till it became a great pile，and I hauled up my oomiak，which was of the value of twenty kayaks．And in the morning there was no pile．

“Then made I preparation for the wedding，and the people that lived even to the east came for the food of the feast and the potlach token．Unga was older than I by the age of four suns in the way we reckoned the years．I was only a stripling；but then I was a chief，and the son of a chief，and it did not matter．

“But a ship shoved her sails above the floor of the ocean，and grew larger with the breath of the wind．From her scuppers she ran clear water，and the men were in haste and worked hard at the pumps．On the bow stood a mighty man，watching the depth of the water and giving commands with a voice of thunder．His eyes were of the pale blue of the deep waters，and his head was maned like that of a sea lion．And his hair was yellow，like the straw of a southern harvest or the manila rope-yarns which sailormen plait．

“Of late years we had seen ships from afar，but this was the first to come to the beach of Akatan．The feast was broken，and the women and children fled to the houses，while we men strung our bows and waited with spears in hand．But when the ship's forefoot smelt the beach the strange men took no notice of us，being busy with their own work．With the falling of the tide they careened the schooner and patched a great hole in her bottom．So the women crept back，and the feast went on．

“When the tide rose，the sea wanderers kedged the schooner to deep water，and then came among us．They bore presents and were friendly；so I made room for them，and out of the largeness of my heart gave them tokens such as I gave all the guests；for it was my wedding day，and I was head man in Akatan．And he with the mane of the sea lion was there，so tall and strong that one looked to see the earth shake with the fall of his feet．He looked much and straight at Unga，with his arms folded，so，and stayed till the sun went away and the stars came out．Then he went down to his ship．After that I took Unga by the hand and led her to my own house．And there was singing and great laughter，and the women said sly things，after the manner of women at such times．But we did not care．Then the people left us alone and went home．

“The last noise had not died away when the chief of the sea wanderers came in by the door．And he had with him black bottles，from which we drank and made merry．You see，I was only a stripling，and had lived all my days on the edge of the world．So my blood became as fire，and my heart as light as the froth that flies from the surf to the cliff．Unga sat silent among the skins in the corner，her eyes wide，for she seemed to fear．And he with the mane of the sea lion looked upon her straight and long．Then his men came in with bundles of goods，and he piled before me wealth such as was not in all Akatan．There were guns，both large and small，and powder and shot and shell，and bright axes and knives of steel，and cunning tools，and strange things the like of which I had never seen．When he showed me by sign that it was all mine，I thought him a great man to be so free；but，he showed me also that Unga was to go away with him in his ship．Do you understand？—that Unga was to go away with him in his ship．The blood of my fathers flamed hot on the sudden，and I made to drive him through with my spear．But the spirit of the bottles had stolen the life from my arm，and he took me by the neck，so，and knocked my head against the wall of the house．And I was made weak like a newborn child，and my legs would no more stand under me．Unga screamed，and she laid hold of the things of the house with her hands，till they fell all about us as he dragged her to the door．Then he took her in his great arms，and when she tore at his yellow hair laughed with a sound like that of the big bull seal in the rut．

“I crawled to the beach and called upon my people；but they were afraid．Only Yash-Noosh was a man，and they struck him on the head with an oar，till he lay with his face in the sand and did not move．And they raised the sails to the sound of their songs，and the ship went away on the wind．

“The people said it was good，for there would be no more war of the bloods in Akatan；but I said never a word，waiting till the time of the full moon，when I put fish and oil in my kayak，and went away to the east．I saw many islands and many people，and I，who had lived on the edge，saw that the world was very large．I talked by signs；but they had not seen a schooner nor a man with the mane of a sea lion，and they pointed always to the east．And I slept in queer places，and ate odd things，and met strange faces．Many laughed，for they thought me light of head；but sometimes old men turned my face to the light and blessed me，and the eyes of the young women grew soft as they asked me of the strange ship，and Unga，and the men of the sea．

“And in this manner，through rough seas and great storms，I came to Unalaska．There were two schooners there，but neither was the one I sought．So I passed on to the east，with the world growing ever larger，and in the island of Unamok there was no word of the ship，nor in Kadiak，nor in Atognak．And so I came one day to a rocky land，where men dug great holes in the mountain．And there was a schooner，but not my schooner，and men loaded upon it the rocks which they dug．This I thought childish，for all the world was made of rocks；but they gave me food and set me to work．When the schooner was deep in the water，the captain gave me money and told me to go；but I asked which way he went，and he pointed south．I made signs that I would go with him，and he laughed at first，but then，being short of men，took me to help work the ship．So I came to talk after their manner，and to heave on ropes，and to reef the stiff sails in sudden squalls，and to take my turn at the wheel．But it was not strange，for the blood of my fathers was the blood of the men of the sea．

“I had thought it an easy task to find him I sought，once I got among his own people；and when we raised the land one day，and passed between a gateway of the sea to a port，I looked for perhaps as many schooners as there were fingers to my hands．But the ships lay against the wharves for miles，packed like so many little fish；and when I went among them to ask for a man with the mane of a sea lion，they laughed，and answered me in the tongues of many peoples．And I found that they hailed from the uttermost parts of the earth．

“And I went into the city to look upon the face of every man．But they were like the cod when they run thick on the banks，and I could not count them．And the noise smote upon me till I could not hear，and my head was dizzy with much movement．So I went on and on，through the lands which sang in the warm sunshine；where the harvests lay rich on the plains；and where great cities were fat with men that lived like women，with false words in their mouths and their hearts black with the lust of gold．And all the while my people of Akatan hunted and fished，and were happy in the thought that the world was small．

“But the look in the eyes of Unga coming home from the fishing was with me always，and I knew I would find her when the time was met．She walked down quiet lanes in the dusk of the evening，or led me chases across the thick fields wet with the morning dew，and there was a promise in her eyes such as only the woman Unga could give．

“So I wandered through a thousand cities．Some were gentle and gave me food，and others laughed，and still others cursed；but I kept my tongue between my teeth，and went strange ways and saw strange sights．Sometimes，I，who was a chief and the son of a chief，toiled for men，—men rough of speech and hard as iron，who wrung gold from the sweat and sorrow of their fellow men．Yet no word did I get of my quest，till I came back to the sea like a homing seal to the rookeries．But this was at another port，in another country which lay to the north．And there I heard dim tales of the yellow-haired sea wanderer，and I learned that he was a hunter of seals，and that even then he was abroad on the ocean．

“So I shipped on a seal schooner with the lazy Siwashes，and followed his trackless trail to the north where the hunt was then warm．And we were away weary months，and spoke many of the fleet，and heard much of the wild doings of him I sought；but never once did we raise him above the sea．We went north，even to the Pribyloffs，and killed the seals in herds on the beach，and brought their warm bodies aboard till our scuppers ran grease and blood and no man could stand upon the deck．Then were we chased by a ship of slow steam，which fired upon us with great guns．But we put on sail till the sea was over our decks and washed them clean，and lost ourselves in a fog．

“It is said，at this time，while we fled with fear at our hearts，that the yellow-haired sea wanderer put into the Pribyloffs，right to the factory，and while the part of his men held the servants of the company，the rest loaded ten thousand green skins from the salt houses．I say it is said，but I believe；for in the voyages I made on the coast with never a meeting，the northern seas rang with his wildness and daring，till the three nations which have lands there sought him with their ships．And I heard of Unga，for the captains sang loud in her praise，and she was always with him．She had learned the ways of his people，they said，and was happy．But I knew better，—knew that her heart harked back to her own people by the yellow beach of Akatan．

“So，after a long time，I went back to the port which is by a gateway of the sea，and there I learned that he had gone across the girth of the great ocean to hunt for the seal to the east of the warm land which runs south from the Russian seas．And I，who was become a sailorman，shipped with men of his own race，and went after him in the hunt of the seal．And there were few ships off that new land；but we hung on the flank of the seal pack and harried it north through all the spring of the year．And when the cows were heavy with pup and crossed the Russian line，our men grumbled and were afraid．For there was much fog，and every day men were lost in the boats．They would not work，so the captain turned the ship back toward the way it came．But I knew the yellow-haired sea wanderer was unafraid，and would hang by the pack，even to the Russian Isles，where few men go．So I took a boat，in the black of night，when the lookout dozed on the fo'c'slehead，and went alone to the warm，long land．And I journeyed south to meet the men by Yeddo Bay，who are wild and unafraid．And the Yoshiwara girls were small，and bright like steel，and good to look upon；but I could not stop，for I knew that Unga rolled on the tossing floor by the rookeries of the north．

“The men by Yeddo Bay had met from the ends of the earth，and had neither gods nor homes，sailing under the flag of the Japanese．And with them I went to the rich beaches of Copper Island，where our salt-piles became high with skins．And in that silent sea we saw no man till we were ready to come away．Then，one day，the fog lifted on the edge of a heavy wind，and there jammed down upon us a schooner，with close in her wake the cloudy funnels of a Russian man-of-war．We fled away on the beam of the wind，with the schooner jamming still closer and plunging ahead three feet to our two．And upon her poop was the man with the mane of the sea lion，pressing the rails under with the canvas and laughing in his strength of life．And Unga was there，—I knew her on the moment，—but he sent her below when the cannons began to talk across the sea．As I say，with three feet to our two，till we saw the rudder lift green at every jump，—and I swinging on to the wheel and cursing，with my back to the Russian shot．For we knew he had it in mind to run before us，that he might get away while we were caught．And they knocked our masts out of us till we dragged into the wind like a wounded gull；but he went on over the edge of the sky-line，—he and Unga．

“What could we？The fresh hides spoke for themselves．So they took us to a Russian port，and after that to a lone country，where they set us to work in the mines to dig salt．And some died，and—and some did not die．”

Naass swept the blanket from his shoulders，disclosing the gnarled and twisted flesh，marked with the unmistakable striations of the knout．Prince hastily covered him，for it was not nice to look upon．

“We were there a weary time；and sometimes men got away to the south，but they always came back．So，when we who hailed from Yeddo Bay rose in the night and took the guns from the guards，we went to the north．And the land was very large，with plains，soggy with water，and great forests．And the cold came，with much snow on the ground，and no man knew the way．Weary months we journeyed through the endless forest，—I do not remember，now，for there was little food and often we lay down to die．But at last we came to the cold sea，and but three were left to look upon it．One had shipped from Yeddo as captain，and he knew in his head the lay of the great lands，and of the place where men may cross from one to the other on the ice．And he led us，—I do not know，it was so long，—till there were but two．When we came to that place we found five of the strange people which live in that country，and they had dogs and skins，and we were very poor．We fought in the snow till they died，and the captain died，and the dogs and skins were mine．Then I crossed on the ice，which was broken，and once I drifted till a gale from the west put me upon the shore．And after that，Golovin Bay，Pastilik，and the priest．Then south，south，to the warm sunlands where first I wandered．

“But the sea was no longer fruitful，and those who went upon it after the seal went to little profit and great risk．The fleets scattered，and the captains and the men had no word of those I sought．So I turned away from the ocean which never rests，and went among the lands，where the trees，the houses，and the mountains sit always in one place and do not move．I journeyed far，and came to learn many things，even to the way of reading and writing from books．It was well I should do this，for it came upon me that Unga must know these things，and that some day，when the time was met—we—you understand，when the time was met．

“So I drifted，like those little fish which raise a sail to the wind，but cannot steer．But my eyes and my ears were open always，and I went among men who traveled much，for I knew they had but to see those I sought，to remember．At last there came a man，fresh from the mountains，with pieces of rock in which the free gold stood to the size of peas，and he had heard，he had met，he knew them．They were rich，he said，and lived in the place where they drew the gold from the ground．

“It was in a wild country，and very far away；but in time I came to the camp，hidden between the mountains，where men worked night and day，out of the sight of the sun．Yet the time was not come．I listened to the talk of the people．He had gone away，—they had gone away—，to England，it was said，in the matter of bringing men with much money together to form companies．I saw the house they had lived in；more like a palace，such as one sees in the old countries．In the nighttime I crept in through a window that I might see in what manner he treated her．I went from room to room，and in such way thought kings and queens must live，it was all so very good．And they all said he treated her like a queen，and many marveled as to what breed of woman she was；for there was other blood in her veins，and she was different from the women of Akatan，and no one knew her for what she was．Ay，she was a queen；but I was a chief，and the son of a chief，and I had paid for her an untold price of skin and boat and bead．

“But why so many words？I was a sailorman，and knew the way of the ships on the seas．I followed to England，and then to other countries．Sometimes I heard of them by word of mouth，sometimes I read of them in the papers；yet never once could I come by them，for they had much money，and traveled fast，while I was a poor man．Then came trouble upon them，and their wealth slipped away，one day，like a curl of smoke．The papers were full of it at the time；but after that nothing was said，and I knew they had gone back where more gold could be got from the ground．

“They had dropped out of the world，being now poor；and so I wandered from camp to camp，even north to the Kootenay country，where I picked up the cold scent．They had come and gone，some said this way，and some that，and still others that they had gone to the country of the Yukon．And I went this way，and I went that，ever journeying from place to place，till it seemed I must grow weary of the world which was so large．But in the Kootenay I traveled a bad trail，and a long trail，with a ‘breed'of the Northwest，who saw fit to die when the famine pinched．He had been to the Yukon by an unknown way over the mountains，and when he knew his time was near gave me the map and the secret of a place where he swore by his gods there was much gold．

“After that all the world began to flock into the north．I was a poor man；I sold myself to be a driver of dogs．The rest you know．I met him and her in Dawson．She did not know me，for I was only a stripling，and her life had been large，so she had no time to remember the one who had paid for her an untold price．

“So？You bought me from my term of service．I went back to bring things about in my own way；for I had waited long，and now that I had my hand upon him was in no hurry．As I say，I had it in mind to do my own way；for I read back in my life，through all I had seen and suffered，and remembered the cold and hunger of the endless forest by the Russian seas．As you know，I led him into the east，—him and Unga，—into the east where many have gone and few returned．I led them to the spot where the bones and the curses of men lie with the gold which they may not have．

“The way was long and the trail unpacked．Our dogs were many and ate much；nor could our sleds carry till the break of spring．We must come back before the river ran free．So here and there we cached grub，that our sleds might be lightened and there be no chance of famine on the back trip．At the McQuestion there were three men，and near them we built a cache，as also did we at the Mayo，where was a hunting-camp of a dozen Pellys which had crossed the divide from the south．After that，as we went on into the east，we saw no men；only the sleeping river，the moveless forest，and the White Silence of the North．As I say，the way was long and the trail unpacked．Sometimes，in a day's toil，we made no more than eight miles，or ten，and at night we slept like dead men．And never once did they dream that I was Naass，head man of Akatan，the righter of wrongs．

“We now made smaller caches，and in the nighttime it was a small matter to go back on the trail we had broken，and change them in such way that one might deem the wolverines the thieves．Again，there be places where there is a fall to the river，and the water is unruly，and the ice makes above and is eaten away beneath．In such a spot the sled I drove broke through，and the dogs；and to him and Unga it was ill luck，but no more．And there was much grub on that sled，and the dogs the strongest．But he laughed，for he was strong of life，and gave the dogs that were left little grub till we cut them from the harnesses，one by one，and fed them to their mates．We would go home light，he said，traveling and eating from cache to cache，with neither dogs nor sleds；which was true，for our grub was very short，and the last dog died in the traces the night we came to the gold and the bones and the curses of men．

“To reach that place，—and the map spoke true，—in the heart of the great mountains，we cut ice steps against the wall of a divide．One looked for a valley beyond，but there was no valley；the snow spread away，level as the great harvest plains，and here and there about us mighty mountains shoved their white heads among the stars．And midway on that strange plain which should have been a valley，the earth and the snow fell away，straight down toward the heart of the world．Had we not been sailormen our heads would have swung round with the sight；but we stood on the dizzy edge that we might see a way to get down．And on one side，and one side only，the wall had fallen away till it was like the slope of the decks in a topsail breeze．I do not know why this thing should be so，but it was so．‘It is the mouth of hell，’ he said；‘let us go down．’ And we went down．

“And on the bottom there was a cabin，built by some man，of logs which he had cast down from above．It was a very old cabin；for men had died there alone at different times，and on pieces of birch bark which were there we read their last words and their curses．One had died of scurvy；another's partner had robbed him of his last grub and powder and stolen away；a third had been mauled by a bald-face grizzly；a fourth had hunted for game and starved—and so it went，and they had been loath to leave the gold，and had died by the side of it in one way or another．And the worthless gold they had gathered yellowed the floor of the cabin like in a dream．

“But his soul was steady，and his head clear，this man I had led thus far．‘We have nothing to eat，’ he said，‘and we will only look upon this gold，and see whence it comes and how much there be．Then we will go away quick，before it gets into our eyes and steals away our judgment．And in this way we may return in the end，with more grub，and possess it all．’ So we looked upon the great vein，which cut the wall of the pit as a true vein should；and we measured it，and traced it from above and below，and drove the stakes of the claims and blazed the trees in token of our rights．Then，our knees shaking with lack of food，and a sickness in our bellies，and our hearts chugging close to our mouths，we climbed the mighty wall for the last time and turned our faces to the back trip．

“The last stretch we dragged Unga between us，and we fell often，but in the end we made the cache．And lo，there was no grub．It was well done，for he thought it the wolverines，and damned them and his gods in the one breath．But Unga was brave，and smiled，and put her hand in his，till I turned away that I might hold myself．‘We will rest by the fire，’ she said，‘till morning，and we will gather strength from our moccasins．’ So we cut the tops of our moccasins in strips，and boiled them half of the night，that we might chew them and swallow them．And in the morning we talked of our chance．The next cache was five days' journey；we could not make it．We must find game．

“‘We will go forth and hunt，’ he said．

“‘Yes，’ said I，‘we will go forth and hunt．’

“And he ruled that Unga stay by the fire and save her strength．And we went forth，he in quest of the moose，and I to the cache I had changed．But I ate little，so they might not see in me much strength．And in the night he fell many times as he drew into camp．And I too made to suffer great weakness，stumbling over my snowshoes as though each step might be my last．And we gathered strength from our moccasins．

“He was a great man．His soul lifted his body to the last；nor did he cry aloud，save for the sake of Unga．On the second day I followed him，that I might not miss the end．And he lay down to rest often．That night he was near gone；but in the morning he swore weakly and went forth again．He was like a drunken man，and I looked many times for him to give up；but his was the strength of the strong，and his soul the soul of a giant，for he lifted his body through all the weary day．And he shot two ptarmigan，but would not eat them．He needed no fire；they meant life；but his thought was for Unga，and he turned toward camp．He no longer walked，but crawled on hand and knee through the snow．I came to him，and read death in his eyes．Even then it was not too late to eat of the ptarmigan．He cast away his rifle，and carried the birds in his mouth like a dog．I walked by his side，upright．And he looked at me during the moments he rested，and wondered that I was so strong．I could see it，though he no longer spoke；and when his lips moved，they moved without sound．As I say，he was a great man，and my heart spoke for softness；but I read back in my life，and remembered the cold and hunger of the endless forest by the Russian seas．Besides，Unga was mine，and I had paid for her an untold price of skin and boat and bead．

“And in this manner we came through the white forest，with the silence heavy upon us like a damp sea mist．And the ghosts of the past were in the air and all about us；and I saw the yellow beach of Akatan，and the kayaks racing home from the fishing，and the houses on the rim of the forest．And the men who had made themselves chiefs were there，the lawgivers whose blood I bore，and whose blood I had wedded in Unga．Ay，and Yash-Noosh walked with me，the wet sand in his hair，and his war spear，broken as he fell upon it，still in his hand．And I knew the time was met，and saw in the eyes of Unga the promise．

“As I say，we came thus through the forest，till the smell of the camp smoke was in our nostrils．And I bent above him，and tore the ptarmigan from his teeth．He turned on his side and rested，the wonder mounting in his eyes，and the hand which was under slipping slow toward the knife at his hip．But I took it from him，smiling close in his face．Even then he did not understand．So I made to drink from black bottles，and to build high upon the snow a pile of goods，and to live again the things which happened on the night of my marriage．I spoke no word，but he understood．Yet was he unafraid．There was a sneer to his lips，and cold anger，and he gathered new strength with the knowledge．It was not far，but the snow was deep，and he dragged himself very slow．Once，he lay so long，I turned him over and gazed into his eyes．And sometimes he looked forth，and sometimes death．And when I loosed him he struggled on again．In this way we came to the fire．Unga was at his side on the instant．His lips moved，without sound；then he pointed at me，that Unga might understand．And after that he lay in the snow，very still，for a long while．Even now is he there in the snow．

“I said no word till I had cooked the ptarmigan．Then I spoke to her，in her own tongue，which she had not heard in many years．She straightened herself，so，and her eyes were wonder-wide，and she asked who I was，and where I had learned that speech．

“‘I am Naass，’ I said．

“‘You？’ she said．‘You？’ And she crept close that she might look upon me．

“‘Yes，’ I answered；‘I am Naass，head man of Akatan，the last of the blood，as you are the last of the blood．’

“And she laughed．By all the things I have seen and the deeds I have done，may I never hear such a laugh again．It put the chill to my soul，sitting there in the White Silence，alone with death and this woman who laughed．

“‘Come！’ I said，for I thought she wandered．‘Eat of the food and let us be gone．It is a far fetch from here to Akatan．’

“But she shoved her face in his yellow mane，and laughed till it seemed the heavens must fall about our ears．I had thought she would be overjoyed at the sight of me，and eager to go back to the memory of old times；but this seemed a strange form to take．

“‘Come！’ I cried，taking her strong by the hand．‘The way is long and dark．Let us hurry！’

“‘Where？’ she asked，sitting up，and ceasing from her strange mirth．

“‘To Akatan，’ I answered，intent on the light to grow on her face at the thought．But it became like his，with a sneer to the lips，and cold anger．

“‘Yes，’ she said；‘we will go，hand in hand，to Akatan，you and I．And we will live in the dirty huts，and eat of the fish and oil，and bring forth a spawn，—a spawn to be proud of all the days of our life．We will forget the world and be happy，very happy．It is good，most good．Come！Let us hurry．Let us go back to Akatan．’

“And she ran her hand through his yellow hair，and smiled in a way which was not good．And there was no promise in her eyes．

“I sat silent，and marveled at the strangeness of woman．I went back to the night when he dragged her from me，and she screamed and tore at his hair，—at his hair which now she played with and would not leave．Then I remembered the price and the long years of waiting；and I gripped her close，and dragged her away as he had done．And she held back，even as on that night，and fought like a she-cat for its whelp．And when the fire was between us and the man．I loosed her，and she sat and listened．And I told her of all that lay between，of all that had happened me on strange seas，of all that I had done in strange lands；of my weary quest，and the hungry years，and the promise which had been mine from the first．Ay，I told all，even to what had passed that day between the man and me，and in the days yet young．And as I spoke I saw the promise grow in her eyes，full and large like the break of dawn．And I read pity there，the tenderness of woman，the love，the heart and the soul of Unga．And I was a stripling again，for the look was the look of Unga as she ran up the beach，laughing，to the home of her mother．The stern unrest was gone，and the hunger，and the weary waiting．The time was met．I felt the call of her breast，and it seemed there I must pillow my head and forget．She opened her arms to me，and I came against her．Then，sudden，the hate flamed in her eye，her hand was at my hip．And once，twice，she passed the knife．

“‘Dog！’ she sneered，as she flung me into the snow．‘Swine！’ And then she laughed till the silence cracked，and went back to her dead．

“As I say，once she passed the knife，and twice；but she was weak with hunger，and it was not meant that I should die．Yet was I minded to stay in that place，and to close my eyes in the last long sleep with those whose lives had crossed with mine and led my feet on unknown trails．But there lay a debt upon me which would not let me rest．

“And the way was long，the cold bitter，and there was little grub．The Pellys had found no moose，and had robbed my cache．And so had the three white men；but they lay thin and dead in their cabins as I passed．After that I do not remember，till I came here，and found food and fire，—much fire．”

As he finished，he crouched closely，even jealously，over the stove．For a long while the slush-lamp shadows played tragedies upon the wall．

“But Unga！”cried Prince，the vision still strong upon him．

“Unga？She would not eat of the ptarmigan．She lay with her arms about his neck，her face deep in his yellow hair．I drew the fire close，that she might not feel the frost，but she crept to the other side．And I built a fire there；yet it was little good，for she would not eat．And in this manner they still lie up there in the snow．”

“And you？”asked Malemute Kid．

“I do not know；but Akatan is small，and I have little wish to go back and live on the edge of the world．Yet is there small use in life．I can go to Constantine，and he will put irons upon me，and one day they will tie a piece of rope，so，and I will sleep good．Yet—no；I do not know．”

“But，Kid，”protested Prince，“this is murder！”

“Hush！”commanded Malemute Kid．“There be things greater than our wisdom，beyond our justice．The right and the wrong of this we cannot say，and it is not for us to judge．”

Naass drew yet closer to the fire．There was a great silence，and in each man's eyes many pictures came and went．





Love of Life


This out of all will remain—

They have lived and have tossed；

So much of the game will be gain，

Though the gold of the dice has been lost．

They limped painfully down the bank，and once the foremost of the two men staggered among the rough-strewn rocks．They were tired and weak，and their faces had the drawn expression of patience which comes of hardship long endured．They were heavily burdened with blanket packs which were strapped to their shoulders．Head-straps，passing across the forehead，helped support these packs．Each man carried a rifle．They walked in a stooped posture，the shoulders well forward，the head still farther forward，the eyes bent upon the ground．

“I wish we had just about two of them cartridges that's layin' in that cache of ourn，”said the second man．

His voice was utterly and drearily expressionless．He spoke without enthusiasm；and the first man，limping into the milky stream that foamed over the rocks，vouchsafed no reply．

The other man followed at his heels．They did not remove their foot-gear，though the water was icy cold—so cold that their ankles ached and their feet went numb．In places the water dashed against their knees，and both men staggered for footing．

The man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder，nearly fell，but recovered himself with a violent effort，at the same time uttering a sharp exclamation of pain．He seemed faint and dizzy and put out his free hand while he reeled，as though seeking support against the air．When he had steadied himself he stepped forward，but reeled again and nearly fell．Then he stood still and looked at the other man，who had never turned his head．

The man stood still for fully a minute，as though debating with himself．Then he called out：

“I say，Bill，I've sprained my ankle．”

Bill staggered on through the milky water．He did not look around．The man watched him go，and though his face was expressionless as ever，his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer．

The other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on without looking back．The man in the stream watched him．His lips trembled a little，so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered them was visibly agitated．His tongue even strayed out to moisten them．

“Bill！”he cried out．

It was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress，but Bill's head did not turn．The man watched him go，limping grotesquely and lurching forward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the soft sky-line of the low-lying hill．He watched him go till he passed over the crest and disappeared．Then he turned his gaze and slowly took in the circle of the world that remained to him now that Bill was gone．

Near the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly，almost obscured by formless mists and vapors，which gave an impression of mass and density without outline or tangibility．The man pulled out his watch，the while resting his weight on one leg．It was four o'clock，and as the season was near the last of July or first of August，—he did not know the precise date within a week or two，—he knew that the sun roughly marked the northwest．He looked to the south and knew that somewhere beyond those bleak hills lay the Great Bear Lake；also，he knew that in that direction the Arctic Circle cut its forbidding way across the Canadian Barrens．This stream in which he stood was a feeder to the Coppermine River，which in turn flowed north and emptied into Coronation Gulf and the Arctic Ocean．He had never been there，but he had seen it，once，on a Hudson Bay Company chart．

Again his gaze completed the circle of the world about him．It was not a heartening spectacle．Everywhere was soft sky-line．The hills were all low-lying．There were no trees，no shrubs，no grasses—naught but a tremendous and terrible desolation that sent fear swiftly dawning into his eyes．

“Bill！”he whispered，once and twice；“Bill！”

He cowered in the midst of the milky water，as though the vastness were pressing in upon him with overwhelming force，brutally crushing him with its complacent awfulness．He began to shake as with an ague-fit，till the gun fell from his hand with a splash．This served to rouse him．He fought with his fear and pulled himself together，groping in the water and recovering the weapon．He hitched his pack farther over on his left shoulder，so as to take a portion of its weight from off the injured ankle．Then he proceeded，slowly and carefully，wincing with pain，to the bank．

He did not stop．With a desperation that was madness，unmindful of the pain，he hurried up the slope to the crest of the hill over which his comrade had disappeared—more grotesque and comical by far than that limping，jerking comrade．But at the crest he saw a shallow valley，empty of life．He fought with his fear again，overcame it，hitched the pack still farther over on his left shoulder，and lurched on down the slope．

The bottom of the valley was soggy with water，which the thick moss held，spongelike，close to the surface．This water squirted out from under his feet at every step，and each time he lifted a foot the action culminated in a sucking sound as the wet moss reluctantly released its grip．He picked his way from muskeg to muskeg，and followed the other man's footsteps along and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets through the sea of moss．

Though alone，he was not lost．Farther on he knew he would come to where dead spruce and fir，very small and weazened，bordered the shore of a little lake，the titchin-nichilie，in the tongue of the country，the “land of little sticks．”And into that lake flowed a small stream，the water of which was not milky．There was rush-grass on that stream—this he remembered well—but no timber，and he would follow it till its first trickle ceased at a divide．He would cross this divide to the first trickle of another stream，flowing to the west，which he would follow until it emptied into the river Dease，and here he would find a cache under an upturned canoe and piled over with many rocks．And in this cache would be ammunition for his empty gun，fish-hooks and lines，a small net—all the utilities for the killing and snaring of food．Also，he would find flour，—not much，—a piece of bacon，and some beans．

Bill would be waiting for him there，and they would paddle away south down the Dease to the Great Bear Lake．And south across the lake they would go，ever south，till they gained the Mackenzie．And south，still south，they would go，while the winter raced vainly after them，and the ice formed in the eddies，and the days grew chill and crisp，south to some warm Hudson Bay Company post，where timber grew tall and generous and there was grub without end．

These were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward．But hard as he strove with his body，he strove equally hard with his mind，trying to think that Bill had not deserted him，that Bill would surely wait for him at the cache．He was compelled to think this thought，or else there would not be any use to strive，and he would have lain down and died．And as the dim ball of the sun sank slowly into the northwest he covered every inch—and many times—of his and Bill's flight south before the downcoming winter．And he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of the Hudson Bay Company post over and over again．He had not eaten for two days；for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat．Often he stooped and picked pale muskeg berries，put them into his mouth，and chewed and swallowed them．A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed in a bit of water．In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews sharp and bitter．The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries，but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and defying experience．

At nine o'clock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge，and from sheer weariness and weakness staggered and fell．He lay for some time，without movement，on his side．Then he slipped out of the pack-straps and clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture．It was not yet dark，and in the lingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds of dry moss．When he had gathered a heap he built a fire，—a smouldering，smudgy fire，—and put a tin pot of water on to boil．

He unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count his matches．There were sixty-seven．He counted them three times to make sure．He divided them into several portions，wrapping them in oil paper，disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch，of another bunch in the inside band of his battered hat，of a third bunch under his shirt on the chest．This accomplished，a panic came upon him，and he unwrapped them all and counted them again．There were still sixty-seven．

He dried his wet foot-gear by the fire．The moccasins were in soggy shreds．The blanket socks were worn through in places，and his feet were raw and bleeding．His ankle was throbbing，and he gave it an examination．It had swollen to the size of his knee．He tore a long strip from one of his two blankets and bound the ankle tightly．He tore other strips and bound them about his feet to serve for both moccasins and socks．Then he drank the pot of water，steaming hot，wound his watch，and crawled between his blankets．

He slept like a dead man．The brief darkness around midnight came and went．The sun arose in the northeast—at least the day dawned in that quarter，for the sun was hidden by gray clouds．

At six o'clock he awoke，quietly lying on his back．He gazed straight up into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry．As he rolled over on his elbow he was startled by a loud snort，and saw a bull caribou regarding him with alert curiosity．The animal was not mere than fifty feet away，and instantly into the man's mind leaped the vision and the savor of a caribou steak sizzling and frying over a fire．Mechanically he reached for the empty gun，drew a bead，and pulled the trigger．The bull snorted and leaped away，his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the ledges．

The man cursed and flung the empty gun from him．He groaned aloud as he started to drag himself to his feet．It was a slow and arduous task．His joints were like rusty hinges．They worked harshly in their sockets，with much friction，and each bending or unbending was accomplished only through a sheer exertion of will．When he finally gained his feet，another minute or so was consumed in straightening up，so that he could stand erect as a man should stand．

He crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect．There were no trees，no bushes，nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely diversified by gray rocks，gray lakelets，and gray streamlets．The sky was gray．There was no sun nor hint of sun．He had no idea of north，and he had forgotten the way he had come to this spot the night before．But he was not lost．He knew that．Soon he would come to the land of the little sticks．He felt that it lay off to the left somewhere，not far—possibly just over the next low hill．

He went back to put his pack into shape for travelling．He assured himself of the existence of his three separate parcels of matches，though he did not stop to count them．But he did linger，debating，over a squat moosehide sack．It was not large．He could hide it under his two hands．He knew that it weighed fifteen pounds，—as much as all the rest of the pack，—and it worried him．He finally set it to one side and proceeded to roll the pack．He paused to gaze at the squat moosehide sack．He picked it up hastily with a defiant glance about him，as though the desolation were trying to rob him of it；and when he rose to his feet to stagger on into the day，it was included in the pack on his back．

He bore away to the left，stopping now and again to eat muskeg berries．His ankle had stiffened，his limp was more pronounced，but the pain of it was as nothing compared with the pain of his stomach．The hunger pangs were sharp．They gnawed and gnawed until he could not keep his mind steady on the course he must pursue to gain the land of little sticks．The muskeg berries did not allay this gnawing，while they made his tongue and the roof of his mouth sore with their irritating bite．

He came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings from the ledges and muskegs．Ker—ker—ker was the cry they made．He threw stones at them，but could not hit them．He placed his pack on the ground and stalked them as a cat stalks a sparrow．The sharp rocks cut through his pants' legs till his knees left a trail of blood；but the hurt was lost in the hurt of his hunger．He squirmed over the wet moss，saturating his clothes and chilling his body；but he was not aware of it，so great was his fever for food．And always the ptarmigan rose，whirring，before him，till their ker—ker—ker became a mock to him，and he cursed them and cried aloud at them with their own cry．

Once he crawled upon one that must have been asleep．He did not see it till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook．He made a clutch as startled as was the rise of the ptarmigan，and there remained in his hand three tail-feathers．As he watched its flight he hated it，as though it had done him some terrible wrong．Then he returned and shouldered his pack．

As the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was more plentiful．A band of caribou passed by，twenty and odd animals，tantalizingly within rifle range．He felt a wild desire to run after them，a certitude that he could run them down．A black fox came toward him，carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth．The man shouted．It was a fearful cry，but the fox，leaping away in fright，did not drop the ptarmigan．

Late in the afternoon he followed a stream，milky with lime，which ran through sparse patches of rush-grass．Grasping these rushes firmly near the root，he pulled up what resembled a young onion-sprout no larger than a shingle-nail．It was tender，and his teeth sank into it with a crunch that promised deliciously of food．But its fibers were tough．It was composed of stringy filaments saturated with water，like the berries，and devoid of nourishment．He threw off his pack and went into the rush-grass on hands and knees，crunching and munching，like some bovine creature．

He was very weary and often wished to rest—to lie down and sleep；but he was continually driven on—not so much by his desire to gain the land of little sticks as by his hunger．He searched little ponds for frogs and dug up the earth with his nails for worms，though he knew in spite that neither frogs nor worms existed so far north．

He looked into every pool of water vainly，until，as the long twilight came on，he discovered a solitary fish，the size of a minnow，in such a pool．He plunged his arm in up to the shoulder，but it eluded him．He reached for it with both hands and stirred up the milky mud at the bottom．In his excitement he fell in，wetting himself to the waist．Then the water was too muddy to admit of his seeing the fish，and he was compelled to wait until the sediment had settled．

The pursuit was renewed，till the water was again muddied．But he could not wait．He unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the pool．He baled wildly at first，splashing himself and flinging the water so short a distance that it ran back into the pool．He worked more carefully，striving to be cool，though his heart was pounding against his chest and his hands were trembling．At the end of half an hour the pool was nearly dry．Not a cupful of water remained．And there was no fish．He found a hidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger pool—a pool which he could not empty in a night and a day．Had he known of the crevice，he could have closed it with a rock at the beginning and the fish would have been his．

Thus he thought，and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet earth．At first he cried softly to himself，then he cried loudly to the pitiless desolation that ringed him around；and for a long time after he was shaken by great dry sobs．

He built a fire and warmed himself by drinking quarts of hot water，and made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had the night before．The last thing he did was to see that his matches were dry and to wind his watch．The blankets were wet and clammy．His ankle pulsed with pain．But he knew only that he was hungry，and through his restless sleep he dreamed of feasts and banquets and of food served and spread in all imaginable ways．

He awoke chilled and sick．There was no sun．The gray of earth and sky had become deeper，more profound．A raw wind was blowing，and the first flurries of snow were whitening the hilltops．The air about him thickened and grew white while he made a fire and boiled more water．It was wet snow，half rain，and the flakes were large and soggy．At first they melted as soon as they came in contact with the earth，but ever more fell，covering the ground，putting out the fire，spoiling his supply of moss-fuel．

This was a signal for him to strap on his pack and stumble onward，he knew not where．He was not concerned with the land of little sticks，nor with Bill and the cache under the upturned canoe by the river Dease．He was mastered by the verb “to eat．”He was hunger-mad．He took no heed of the course he pursued，so long as that course led him through the swale bottoms．He felt his way through the wet snow to the watery muskeg berries，and went by feel as he pulled up the rush-grass by the roots．But it was tasteless stuff and did not satisfy．He found a weed that tasted sour and he ate all he could find of it，which was not much，for it was a creeping growth，easily hidden under the several inches of snow．

He had no fire that night，nor hot water，and crawled under his blanket to sleep the broken hunger-sleep．The snow turned into a cold rain．He awakened many times to feel it falling on his upturned face．Day came—a gray day and no sun．It had ceased raining．The keenness of his hunger had departed．Sensibility，as far as concerned the yearning for food，had been exhausted．There was a dull，heavy ache in his stomach，but it did not bother him so much．He was more rational，and once more he was chiefly interested in the land of little sticks and the cache by the river Dease．

He ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into strips and bound his bleeding feet．Also，he recinched the injured ankle and prepared himself for a day of travel．When he came to his pack，he paused long over the squat moosehide sack，but in the end it went with him．

The snow had melted under the rain，and only the hilltops showed white．The sun came out，and he succeeded in locating the points of the compass，though he knew now that he was lost．Perhaps，in his previous days' wanderings，he had edged away too far to the left．He now bore off to the right to counteract the possible deviation from his true course．

Though the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite，he realized that he was weak．He was compelled to pause for frequent rests，when he attacked the muskeg berries and rush-grass patches．His tongue felt dry and large，as though covered with a fine hairy growth，and it tasted bitter in his mouth．His heart gave him a great deal of trouble．When he had travelled a few minutes it would begin a remorseless thump，thump，thump，and then leap up and away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him and made him go faint and dizzy．

In the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large pool．It was impossible to bale it，but he was calmer now and managed to catch them in his tin bucket．They were no longer than his little finger，but he was not particularly hungry．The dull ache in his stomach had been growing duller and fainter．It seemed almost that his stomach was dozing．He ate the fish raw，masticating with painstaking care，for the eating was an act of pure reason．While he had no desire to eat，he knew that he must eat to live．

In the evening he caught three more minnows，eating two and saving the third for breakfast．The sun had dried stray shreds of moss，and he was able to warm himself with hot water．He had not covered more than ten miles that day；and the next day，travelling whenever his heart permitted him，he covered no more than five miles．But his stomach did not give him the slightest uneasiness．It had gone to sleep．He was in a strange country，too，and the caribou were growing more plentiful，also the wolves．Often their yelps drifted across the desolation，and once he saw three of them slinking away before his path．

Another night；and in the morning，being more rational，he untied the leather string that fastened the squat moosehide sack．From its open mouth poured a yellow stream of coarse gold-dust and nuggets．He roughly divided the gold in halves，caching one half on a prominent ledge，wrapped in a piece of blanket，and returning the other half to the sack．He also began to use strips of the one remaining blanket for his feet．He still clung to his gun，for there were cartridges in that cache by the river Dease．

This was a day of fog，and this day hunger awoke in him again．He was very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness which at times blinded him．It was no uncommon thing now for him to stumble and fall；and stumbling once，he fell squarely into a ptarmigan nest．There were four newly hatched chicks，a day old—little specks of pulsating life no more than a mouthful；and he ate them ravenously，thrusting them alive into his mouth and crunching them like egg-shells between his teeth．The mother ptarmigan beat about him with great outcry．He used his gun as a club with which to knock her over，but she dodged out of reach．He threw stones at her and with one chance shot broke a wing．Then she fluttered away，running，trailing the broken wing，with him in pursuit．

The little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite．He hopped and bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle，throwing stones and screaming hoarsely at times；at other times hopping and bobbing silently along，picking himself up grimly and patiently when he fell，or rubbing his eyes with his hand when the giddiness threatened to overpower him．

The chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the valley，and he came upon footprints in the soggy moss．They were not his own—he could see that．They must be Bill's．But he could not stop，for the mother ptarmigan was running on．He would catch her first，then he would return and investigate．

He exhausted the mother ptarmigan；but he exhausted himself．She lay panting on her side．He lay panting on his side，a dozen feet away，unable to crawl to her．And as he recovered she recovered，fluttering out of reach as his hungry hand went out to her．The chase was resumed．Night settled down and she escaped．He stumbled from weakness and pitched head foremost on his face，cutting his cheek，his pack upon his back．He did not move for a long while；then he rolled over on his side，wound his watch，and lay there until morning．

Another day of fog．Half of his last blanket had gone into foot-wrappings．He failed to pick up Bill's trail．It did not matter．His hunger was driving him too compellingly—only—only he wondered if Bill，too，were lost．By midday the irk of his pack became too oppressive．Again he divided the gold，this time merely spilling half of it on the ground．In the afternoon he threw the rest of it away，there remaining to him only the half-blanket，the tin bucket，and the rifle．

An hallucination began to trouble him．He felt confident that one cartridge remained to him．It was in the chamber of the rifle and he had overlooked it．On the other hand，he knew all the time that the chamber was empty．But the hallucination persisted．He fought it off for hours，then threw his rifle open and was confronted with emptiness．The disappointment was as bitter as though he had really expected to find the cartridge．

He plodded on for half an hour，when the hallucination arose again．Again he fought it，and still it persisted，till for very relief he opened his rifle to unconvince himself．At times his mind wandered farther afield，and he plodded on，a mere automaton，strange conceits and whimsicalities gnawing at his brain like worms．But these excursions out of the real were of brief duration，for ever the pangs of the hunger-bite called him back．He was jerked back abruptly once from such an excursion by a sight that caused him nearly to faint．He reeled and swayed，doddering like a drunken man to keep from falling．Before him stood a horse．A horse！He could not believe his eyes．A thick mist was in them，intershot with sparkling points of light．He rubbed his eyes savagely to clear his vision，and beheld，not a horse，but a great brown bear．The animal was studying him with bellicose curiosity．

The man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he realized．He lowered it and drew his hunting-knife from its beaded sheath at his hip．Before him was meat and life．He ran his thumb along the edge of his knife．It was sharp．The point was sharp．He would fling himself upon the bear and kill it．But his heart began its warning thump，thump，thump．Then followed the wild upward leap and tattoo of flutters，the pressing as of an iron band about his forehead，the creeping of the dizziness into his brain．

His desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of fear．In his weakness，what if the animal attacked him？He drew himself up to his most imposing stature，gripping the knife and staring hard at the bear．The bear advanced clumsily a couple of steps，reared up，and gave vent to a tentative growl．If the man ran，he would run after him；but the man did not run．He was animated now with the courage of fear．He，too，growled，savagely，terribly，voicing the fear that is to life germane and that lies twisted about life's deepest roots．

The bear edged away to one side，growling menacingly，himself appalled by this mysterious creature that appeared upright and unafraid．But the man did not move．He stood like a statue till the danger was past，when he yielded to a fit of trembling and sank down into the wet moss．

He pulled himself together and went on，afraid now in a new way．It was not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food，but that he should be destroyed violently before starvation had exhausted the last particle of the endeavor in him that made toward surviving．There were the wolves．Back and forth across the desolation drifted their howls，weaving the very air into a fabric of menace that was so tangible that he found himself，arms in the air，pressing it back from him as it might be the walls of a wind-blown tent．

Now and again the wolves，in packs of two and three，crossed his path．But they sheered clear of him．They were not in sufficient numbers，and besides they were hunting the caribou，which did not battle，while this strange creature that walked erect might scratch and bite．

In the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves had made a kill．The debris had been a caribou calf an hour before，squawking and running and very much alive．He contemplated the bones，clean-picked and polished，pink with the cell-life in them which had not yet died．Could it possibly be that he might be that ere the day was done！Such was life，eh？A vain and fleeting thing．It was only life that pained．There was no hurt in death．To die was to sleep．It meant cessation，rest．Then why was he not content to die？

But he did not moralize long．He was squatting in the moss，a bone in his mouth，sucking at the shreds of life that still dyed it faintly pink．The sweet meaty taste，thin and elusive almost as a memory，maddened him．He closed his jaws on the bones and crunched．Sometimes it was the bone that broke，sometimes his teeth．Then he crushed the bones between rocks，pounded them to a pulp，and swallowed them．He pounded his fingers，too，in his haste，and yet found a moment in which to feel surprise at the fact that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under the descending rock．

Came frightful days of snow and rain．He did not know when he made camp，when he broke camp．He travelled in the night as much as in the day．He rested wherever he fell，crawled on whenever the dying life in him flickered up and burned less dimly．He，as a man，no longer strove．It was the life in him，unwilling to die，that drove him on．He did not suffer．His nerves had become blunted，numb，while his mind was filled with weird visions and delicious dreams．

But ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou calf，the least remnants of which he had gathered up and carried with him．He crossed no more hills or divides，but automatically followed a large stream which flowed through a wide and shallow valley．He did not see this stream nor this valley．He saw nothing save visions．Soul and body walked or crawled side by side，yet apart，so slender was the thread that bound them．

He awoke in his right mind，lying on his back on a rocky ledge．The sun was shining bright and warm．Afar off he heard the squawking of caribou calves．He was aware of vague memories of rain and wind and snow，but whether he had been beaten by the storm for two days or two weeks he did not know．For some time he lay without movement，the genial sunshine pouring upon him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth．A fine day，he thought．Perhaps he could manage to locate himself．By a painful effort he rolled over on his side．Below him flowed a wide and sluggish river．Its unfamiliarity puzzled him．Slowly he followed it with his eyes，winding in wide sweeps among the bleak，bare hills，bleaker and barer and lower-lying than any hills he had yet encountered．Slowly，deliberately，without excitement or more than the most casual interest，he followed the course of the strange stream toward the sky-line and saw it emptying into a bright and shining sea．He was still unexcited．Most unusual，he thought，a vision or a mirage—more likely a vision，a trick of his disordered mind．He was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at anchor in the midst of the shining sea．He closed his eyes for a while，then opened them．Strange how the vision persisted！Yet not strange．He knew there were no seas or ships in the heart of the barren lands，just as he had known there was no cartridge in the empty rifle．

He heard a snuffle behind him—a half-choking gasp or cough．Very slowly，because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness，he rolled over on his other side．He could see nothing near at hand，but he waited patiently．Again came the snuffle and cough，and outlined between two jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the gray head of a wolf．The sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on other wolves；the eyes were bleared and bloodshot，the head seemed to droop limply and forlornly．The animal blinked continually in the sunshine．It seemed sick．As he looked it snuffled and coughed again．

This，at least，was real，he thought，and turned on the other side so that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled from him before by the vision．But the sea still shone in the distance and the ship was plainly discernible．Was it reality，after all？He closed his eyes for a long while and thought，and then it came to him．He had been making north by east，away from the Dease Divide and into the Coppermine Valley．This wide and sluggish river was the Coppermine．That shining sea was the Arctic Ocean．That ship was a whaler，strayed east，far east，from the mouth of the Mackenzie，and it was lying at anchor in Coronation Gulf．He remembered the Hudson Bay Company chart he had seen long ago，and it was all clear and reasonable to him．

He sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs．He had worn through the blanket-wrappings，and his feet were shapeless lumps of raw meat．His last blanket was gone．Rifle and knife were both missing．He had lost his hat somewhere，with the bunch of matches in the band，but the matches against his chest were safe and dry inside the tobacco pouch and oil paper．He looked at his watch．It marked eleven o'clock and was still running．Evidently he had kept it wound．

He was calm and collected．Though extremely weak，he had no sensation of pain．He was not hungry．The thought of food was not even pleasant to him，and whatever he did was done by his reason alone．He ripped off his pants' legs to the knees and bound them about his feet．Somehow he had succeeded in retaining the tin bucket．He would have some hot water before he began what he foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship．

His movements were slow．He shook as with a palsy．When he started to collect dry moss，he found he could not rise to his feet．He tried again and again，then contented himself with crawling about on hands and knees．Once he crawled near to the sick wolf．The animal dragged itself reluctantly out of his way，licking its chops with a tongue which seemed hardly to have the strength to curl．The man noticed that the tongue was not the customary healthy red．It was a yellowish brown and seemed coated with a rough and half-dry mucus．

After he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was able to stand，and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed to walk．Every minute or so he was compelled to rest．His steps were feeble and uncertain，just as the wolf's that trailed him were feeble and uncertain；and that night，when the shining sea was blotted out by blackness，he knew he was nearer to it by no more than four miles．

Throughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf，and now and then the squawking of the caribou calves．There was life all around him，but it was strong life，very much alive and well，and he knew the sick wolf clung to the sick man's trail in the hope that the man would die first．In the morning，on opening his eyes，he beheld it regarding him with a wistful and hungry stare．It stood crouched，with tail between its legs，like a miserable and woe-begone dog．It shivered in the chill morning wind，and grinned dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a voice that achieved no more than a hoarse whisper．

The sun rose brightly，and all morning the man tottered and fell toward the ship on the shining sea．The weather was perfect．It was the brief Indian Summer of the high latitudes．It might last a week．Tomorrow or next day it might be gone．

In the afternoon the man came upon a trail．It was of another man，who did not walk，but who dragged himself on all fours．The man thought it might be Bill，but he thought in a dull，uninterested way．He had no curiosity．In fact，sensation and emotion had left him．He was no longer susceptible to pain．Stomach and nerves had gone to sleep．Yet the life that was in him drove him on．He was very weary，but it refused to die．It was because it refused to die that he still ate muskeg berries and minnows，drank his hot water，and kept a wary eye on the sick wolf．

He followed the trail of the other man who dragged himself along，and soon came to the end of it—a few fresh-picked bones where the soggy moss was marked by the foot-pads of many wolves．He saw a squat moosehide sack，mate to his own，which had been torn by sharp teeth．He picked it up，though its weight was almost too much for his feeble fingers．Bill had carried it to the last．Ha！ha！He would have the laugh on Bill．He would survive and carry it to the ship in the shining sea．His mirth was hoarse and ghastly，like a raven's croak，and the sick wolf joined him，howling lugubriously．The man ceased suddenly．How could he have the laugh on Bill if that were Bill；if those bones，so pinky-white and clean，were Bill？

He turned away．Well，Bill had deserted him；but he would not take the gold，nor would he suck Bill's bones．Bill would have，though，had it been the other way around，he mused as he staggered on．

He came to a pool of water．Stooping over in quest of minnows，he jerked his head back as though he had been stung．He had caught sight of his reflected face．So horrible was it that sensibility awoke long enough to be shocked．There were three minnows in the pool，which was too large to drain；and after several ineffectual attempts to catch them in the tin bucket he forbore．He was afraid，because of his great weakness，that he might fall in and drown．It was for this reason that he did not trust himself to the river astride one of the many drift-logs which lined its sand-spits．

That day he decreased the distance between him and the ship by three miles；the next day by two—for he was crawling now as Bill had crawled；and the end of the fifth day found the ship still seven miles away and him unable to make even a mile a day．Still the Indian Summer held on，and he continued to crawl and faint，turn and turn about；and ever the sick wolf coughed and wheezed at his heels．His knees had become raw meat like his feet，and though he padded them with the shirt from his back it was a red track he left behind him on the moss and stones．Once，glancing back，he saw the wolf licking hungrily his bleeding trail，and he saw sharply what his own end might be—unless—unless he could get the wolf．Then began as grim a tragedy of existence as was ever played—a sick man that crawled，a sick wolf that limped，two creatures dragging their dying carcasses across the desolation and hunting each other's lives．

Had it been a well wolf，it would not have mattered so much to the man；but the thought of going to feed the maw of that loathsome and all but dead thing was repugnant to him．He was finicky．His mind had begun to wander again，and to be perplexed by hallucinations，while his lucid intervals grew rarer and shorter．

He was awakened once from a faint by a wheeze close in his ear．The wolf leaped lamely back，losing its footing and falling in its weakness．It was ludicrous，but he was not amused．Nor was he even afraid．He was too far gone for that．But his mind was for the moment clear，and he lay and considered．The ship was no more than four miles away．He could see it quite distinctly when he rubbed the mists out of his eyes，and he could see the white sail of a small boat cutting the water of the shining sea．But he could never crawl those four miles．He knew that，and was very calm in the knowledge．He knew that he could not crawl half a mile．And yet he wanted to live．It was unreasonable that he should die after all he had undergone．Fate asked too much of him．And，dying，he declined to die．It was stark madness，perhaps，but in the very grip of Death he defied Death and refused to die．

He closed his eyes and composed himself with infinite precaution．He steeled himself to keep above the suffocating languor that lapped like a rising tide through all the wells of his being．It was very like a sea，this deadly languor，that rose and rose and drowned his consciousness bit by bit．Sometimes he was all but submerged，swimming through oblivion with a faltering stroke；and again，by some strange alchemy of soul，he would find another shred of will and strike out more strongly．

Without movement he lay on his back，and he could hear，slowly drawing near and nearer，the wheezing intake and output of the sick wolf's breath．It drew closer，ever closer，through an infinitude of time，and he did not move．It was at his ear．The harsh dry tongue grated like sandpaper against his cheek．His hands shot out—or at least he willed them to shoot out．The fingers were curved like talons，but they closed on empty air．Swiftness and certitude require strength，and the man had not this strength．

The patience of the wolf was terrible．The man's patience was no less terrible．For half a day he lay motionless，fighting off unconsciousness and waiting for the thing that was to feed upon him and upon which he wished to feed．Sometimes the languid sea rose over him and he dreamed long dreams；but ever through it all，waking and dreaming，he waited for the wheezing breath and the harsh caress of the tongue．

He did not hear the breath，and he slipped slowly from some dream to the feel of the tongue along his hand．He waited．The fangs pressed softly；the pressure increased；the wolf was exerting its last strength in an effort to sink teeth in the food for which it had waited so long．But the man had waited long，and the lacerated hand closed on the jaw．Slowly，while the wolf struggled feebly and the hand clutched feebly，the other hand crept across to a grip．Five minutes later the whole weight of the man's body was on top of the wolf．The hands had not sufficient strength to choke the wolf，but the face of the man was pressed close to the throat of the wolf and the mouth of the man was full of hair．At the end of half an hour the man was aware of a warm trickle in his throat．It was not pleasant．It was like molten lead being forced into his stomach，and it was forced by his will alone．Later the man rolled over on his back and slept．




There were some members of a scientific expedition on the whale-ship Bedford．From the deck they remarked a strange object on the shore．It was moving down the beach toward the water．They were unable to classify it，and，being scientific men，they climbed into the whale-boat alongside and went ashore to see．And they saw something that was alive but which could hardly be called a man．It was blind，unconscious．It squirmed along the ground like some monstrous worm．Most of its efforts were ineffectual，but it was persistent，and it writhed and twisted and went ahead perhaps a score of feet an hour．




Three weeks afterward the man lay in a bunk on the whale-ship Bedford，and with tears streaming down his wasted cheeks told who he was and what he had undergone．He also babbled incoherently of his mother，of sunny Southern California，and a home among the orange groves and flowers．

The days were not many after that when he sat at table with the scientific men and ship's officers．He gloated over the spectacle of so much food，watching it anxiously as it went into the mouths of others．With the disappearance of each mouthful an expression of deep regret came into his eyes．He was quite sane，yet he hated those men at meal-time．He was haunted by a fear that the food would not last．He inquired of the cook，the cabin-boy，the captain，concerning the food stores．They reassured him countless times；but he could not believe them，and pried cunningly about the lazarette to see with his own eyes．

It was noticed that the man was getting fat．He grew stouter with each day．The scientific men shook their heads and theorized．They limited the man at his meals，but still his girth increased and he swelled prodigiously under his shirt．

The sailors grinned．They knew．And when the scientific men set a watch on the man，they knew too．They saw him slouch for'ard after breakfast，and，like a mendicant，with outstretched palm，accost a sailor．The sailor grinned and passed him a fragment of sea biscuit．He clutched it avariciously，looked at it as a miser looks at gold，and thrust it into his shirt bosom．Similar were the donations from other grinning sailors．

The scientific men were discreet．They let him alone．But they privily examined his bunk．It was lined with hardtack；the mattress was stuffed with hardtack；every nook and cranny was filled with hardtack．Yet he was sane．He was taking precautions against another possible famine—that was all．He would recover from it，the scientific men said；and he did，ere the Bedford's anchor rumbled down in San Francisco Bay．





To Build a Fire


Day had broken cold and gray，exceedingly cold and gray，when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the high earth-bank，where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland．It was a steep bank，and he paused for breath at the top，excusing the act to himself by looking at his watch．It was nine o'clock．There was no sun nor hint of sun，though there was not a cloud in the sky．It was a clear day，and yet there seemed an intangible pall over the face of things，a subtle gloom that made the day dark，and that was due to the absence of sun．This fact did not worry the man．He was used to the lack of sun．It had been days since he had seen the sun，and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb，due south，would just peep above the sky-line and dip immediately from view．

The man flung a look back along the way he had come．The Yukon lay a mile wide and hidden under three feet of ice．On top of this ice were as many feet of snow．It was all pure white，rolling in gentle undulations where the ice-jams of the freeze-up had formed．North and south，as far as his eye could see，it was unbroken white，save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to the south，and that curved and twisted away into the north，where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island．This dark hair-line was the trail—the main trail—that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass，Dyea，and salt water；and that led north seventy miles to Dawson，and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato，and finally to St．Michael on Bering Sea，a thousand miles and half a thousand more．

But all this—the mysterious，far-reaching hair-line trail，the absence of sun from the sky，the tremendous cold，and the strangeness and weirdness of it all—made no impression on the man．It was not because he was long used to it．He was a new-comer in the land，a chechaquo，and this was his first winter．The trouble with him was that he was without imagination．He was quick and alert in the things of life，but only in the things，and not in the significances．Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty-odd degrees of frost．Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable，and that was all．It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature，and upon man's frailty in general，able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold；and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe．Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens，ear-flaps，warm moccasins，and thick socks．Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero．That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head．

As he turned to go on，he spat speculatively．There was a sharp，explosive crackle that startled him．He spat again．And again，in the air，before it could fall to the snow，the spittle crackled．He knew that at fifty below spittle crackled on the snow，but this spittle had crackled in the air．Undoubtedly it was colder than fifty below—how much colder he did not know．But the temperature did not matter．He was bound for the old claim on the left fork of Henderson Creek，where the boys were already．They had come over across the divide from the Indian Creek country，while he had come the roundabout way to take a look at the possibilities of getting out logs in the spring from the islands in the Yukon．He would be in to camp by six o'clock；a bit after dark，it was true，but the boys would be there，a fire would be going，and a hot supper would be ready．As for lunch，he pressed his hand against the protruding bundle under his jacket．It was also under his shirt，wrapped up in a handkerchief and lying against the naked skin．It was the only way to keep the biscuits from freezing．He smiled agreeably to himself as he thought of those biscuits，each cut open and sopped in bacon grease，and each enclosing a generous slice of fried bacon．

He plunged in among the big spruce trees．The trail was faint．A foot of snow had fallen since the last sled had passed over，and he was glad he was without a sled，travelling light．In fact，he carried nothing but the lunch wrapped in the handkerchief．He was surprised，however，at the cold．It certainly was cold，he concluded，as he rubbed his numb nose and cheek-bones with his mittened hand．He was a warm-whiskered man，but the hair on his face did not protect the high cheek-bones and the eager nose that thrust itself aggressively into the frosty air．

At the man's heels trotted a dog，a big native husky，the proper wolf-dog，gray-coated and without any visible or temperamental difference from its brother，the wild wolf．The animal was depressed by the tremendous cold．It knew that it was no time for travelling．Its instinct told it a truer tale than was told to the man by the man's judgment．In reality，it was not merely colder than fifty below zero；it was colder than sixty below，than seventy below．It was seventy-five below zero．Since the freezing-point is thirty-two above zero，it meant that one hundred and seven degrees of frost obtained．The dog did not know anything about thermometers．Possibly in its brain there was no sharp consciousness of a condition of very cold such as was in the man's brain．But the brute had its instinct．It experienced a vague but menacing apprehension that subdued it and made it slink along at the man's heels，and that made it question eagerly every unwonted movement of the man as if expecting him to go into camp or to seek shelter somewhere and build a fire．The dog had learned fire，and it wanted fire，or else to burrow under the snow and cuddle its warmth away from the air．

The frozen moisture of its breathing had settled on its fur in a fine powder of frost，and especially were its jowls，muzzle，and eyelashes whitened by its crystalled breath．The man's red beard and moustache were likewise frosted，but more solidly，the deposit taking the form of ice and increasing with every warm，moist breath he exhaled．Also，the man was chewing tobacco，and the muzzle of ice held his lips so rigidly that he was unable to clear his chin when he expelled the juice．The result was that a crystal beard of the colour and solidity of amber was increasing its length on his chin．If he fell down it would shatter itself，like glass，into brittle fragments．But he did not mind the appendage．It was the penalty all tobacco-chewers paid in that country，and he had been out before in two cold snaps．They had not been so cold as this，he knew，but by the spirit thermometer at Sixty Mile he knew they had been registered at fifty below and at fifty-five．

He held on through the level stretch of woods for several miles，crossed a wide flat of niggerheads，and dropped down a bank to the frozen bed of a small stream．This was Henderson Creek，and he knew he was ten miles from the forks．He looked at his watch．It was ten o'clock．He was making four miles an hour，and he calculated that he would arrive at the forks at half-past twelve．He decided to celebrate that event by eating his lunch there．

The dog dropped in again at his heels，with a tail drooping discouragement，as the man swung along the creek-bed．The furrow of the old sled-trail was plainly visible，but a dozen inches of snow covered the marks of the last runners．In a month no man had come up or down that silent creek．The man held steadily on．He was not much given to thinking，and just then particularly he had nothing to think about save that he would eat lunch at the forks and that at six o'clock he would be in camp with the boys．There was nobody to talk to；and，had there been，speech would have been impossible because of the ice-muzzle on his mouth．So he continued monotonously to chew tobacco and to increase the length of his amber beard．

Once in a while the thought reiterated itself that it was very cold and that he had never experienced such cold．As he walked along he rubbed his cheek-bones and nose with the back of his mittened hand．He did this automatically，now and again changing hands．But rub as he would，the instant he stopped his cheek-bones went numb，and the following instant the end of his nose went numb．He was sure to frost his cheeks；he knew that，and experienced a pang of regret that he had not devised a nose-strap of the sort Bud wore in cold snaps．Such a strap passed across the cheeks，as well，and saved them．But it didn't matter much，after all．What were frosted cheeks？A bit painful，that was all；they were never serious．

Empty as the man's mind was of thoughts，he was keenly observant，and he noticed the changes in the creek，the curves and bends and timber-jams，and always he sharply noted where he placed his feet．Once，coming around a bend，he shied abruptly，like a startled horse，curved away from the place where he had been walking，and retreated several paces back along the trail．The creek he knew was frozen clear to the bottom，—no creek could contain water in that arctic winter，—but he knew also that there were springs that bubbled out from the hillsides and ran along under the snow and on top the ice of the creek．He knew that the coldest snaps never froze these springs，and he knew likewise their danger．They were traps．They hid pools of water under the snow that might be three inches deep，or three feet．Sometimes a skin of ice half an inch thick covered them，and in turn was covered by the snow．Sometimes there were alternate layers of water and ice-skin，so that when one broke through he kept on breaking through for a while，sometimes wetting himself to the waist．

That was why he had shied in such panic．He had felt the give under his feet and heard the crackle of a snow-hidden ice-skin．And to get his feet wet in such a temperature meant trouble and danger．At the very least it meant delay，for he would be forced to stop and build a fire，and under its protection to bare his feet while he dried his socks and moccasins．He stood and studied the creek-bed and its banks，and decided that the flow of water came from the right．He reflected awhile，rubbing his nose and cheeks，then skirted to the left，stepping gingerly and testing the footing for each step．Once clear of the danger，he took a fresh chew of tobacco and swung along at his four-mile gait．

In the course of the next two hours he came upon several similar traps．Usually the snow above the hidden pools had a sunken，candied appearance that advertised the danger．Once again，however，he had a close call；and once，suspecting danger，he compelled the dog to go on in front．The dog did not want to go．It hung back until the man shoved it forward，and then it went quickly across the white，unbroken surface．Suddenly it broke through，floundered to one side，and got away to firmer footing．It had wet its forefeet and legs，and almost immediately the water that clung to it turned to ice．It made quick efforts to lick the ice off its legs，then dropped down in the snow and began to bite out the ice that had formed between the toes．This was a matter of instinct．To permit the ice to remain would mean sore feet．It did not know this．It merely obeyed the mysterious prompting that arose from the deep crypts of its being．But the man knew，having achieved a judgment on the subject，and he removed the mitten from his right hand and helped tear out the ice-particles．He did not expose his fingers more than a minute，and was astonished at the swift numbness that smote them．It certainly was cold．He pulled on the mitten hastily，and beat the hand savagely across his chest．

At twelve o'clock the day was at its brightest．Yet the sun was too far south on its winter journey to clear the horizon．The bulge of the earth intervened between it and Henderson Creek，where the man walked under a clear sky at noon and cast no shadow．At half-past twelve，to the minute，he arrived at the forks of the creek．He was pleased at the speed he had made．If he kept it up，he would certainly be with the boys by six．He unbuttoned his jacket and shirt and drew forth his lunch．The action consumed no more than a quarter of a minute，yet in that brief moment the numbness laid hold of the exposed fingers．He did not put the mitten on，but，instead，struck the fingers a dozen sharp smashes against his leg．Then he sat down on a snow-covered log to eat．The sting that followed upon the striking of his fingers against his leg ceased so quickly that he was startled，he had had no chance to take a bite of biscuit．He struck the fingers repeatedly and returned them to the mitten，baring the other hand for the purpose of eating．He tried to take a mouthful，but the ice-muzzle prevented．He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out．He chuckled at his foolishness，and as he chuckled he noted the numbness creeping into the exposed fingers．Also，he noted that the stinging which had first come to his toes when he sat down was already passing away．He wondered whether the toes were warm or numb．He moved them inside the moccasins and decided that they were numb．

He pulled the mitten on hurriedly and stood up．He was a bit frightened．He stamped up and down until the stinging returned into the feet．It certainly was cold，was his thought．That man from Sulphur Creek had spoken the truth when telling how cold it sometimes got in the country．And he had laughed at him at the time！That showed one must not be too sure of things．There was no mistake about it，it was cold．He strode up and down，stamping his feet and threshing his arms，until reassured by the returning warmth．Then he got out matches and proceeded to make a fire．From the undergrowth，where high water of the previous spring had lodged a supply of seasoned twigs，he got his fire-wood．Working carefully from a small beginning，he soon had a roaring fire，over which he thawed the ice from his face and in the protection of which he ate his biscuits．For the moment the cold of space was outwitted．The dog took satisfaction in the fire，stretching out close enough for warmth and far enough away to escape being singed．

When the man had finished，he filled his pipe and took his comfortable time over a smoke．Then he pulled on his mittens，settled the ear-flaps of his cap firmly about his ears，and took the creek trail up the left fork．The dog was disappointed and yearned back toward the fire．This man did not know cold．Possibly all the generations of his ancestry had been ignorant of cold，of real cold，of cold one hundred and seven degrees below freezing-point．But the dog knew；all its ancestry knew，and it had inherited the knowledge．And it knew that it was not good to walk abroad in such fearful cold．It was the time to lie snug in a hole in the snow and wait for a curtain of cloud to be drawn across the face of outer space whence this cold came．On the other hand，there was no keen intimacy between the dog and the man．The one was the toil-slave of the other，and the only caresses it had ever received were the caresses of the whip-lash and of harsh and menacing throat-sounds that threatened the whip-lash．So the dog made no effort to communicate its apprehension to the man．It was not concerned in the welfare of the man；it was for its own sake that it yearned back toward the fire．But the man whistled，and spoke to it with the sound of whip-lashes，and the dog swung in at the man's heels and followed after．

The man took a chew of tobacco and proceeded to start a new amber beard．Also，his moist breath quickly powdered with white his mustache，eyebrows，and lashes．There did not seem to be so many springs on the left fork of the Henderson，and for half an hour the man saw no signs of any．And then it happened．At a place where there were no signs，where the soft，unbroken snow seemed to advertise solidity beneath，the man broke through．It was not deep．He wet himself halfway to the knees before he floundered out to the firm crust．

He was angry，and cursed his luck aloud．He had hoped to get into camp with the boys at six o'clock，and this would delay him an hour，for he would have to build a fire and dry out his foot-gear．This was imperative at that low temperature—he knew that much；and he turned aside to the bank，which he climbed．On top，tangled in the underbrush about the trunks of several small spruce trees，was a high-water deposit of dry fire-wood—sticks and twigs，principally，but also larger portions of seasoned branches and fine，dry，last-year's grasses．He threw down several large pieces on top of the snow．This served for a foundation and prevented the young flame from drowning itself in the snow it otherwise would melt．The flame he got by touching a match to a small shred of birch-bark that he took from his pocket．This burned even more readily than paper．Placing it on the foundation，he fed the young flame with wisps of dry grass and with the tiniest dry twigs．

He worked slowly and carefully，keenly aware of his danger．Gradually，as the flame grew stronger，he increased the size of the twigs with which he fed it．He squatted in the snow，pulling the twigs out from their entanglement in the brush and feeding directly to the flame．He knew there must be no failure．When it is seventy-five below zero，a man must not fail in his first attempt to build a fire—that is，if his feet are wet．If his feet are dry，and he fails，he can run along the trail for half a mile and restore his circulation．But the circulation of wet and freezing feet cannot be restored by running when it is seventy-five below．No matter how fast he runs，the wet feet will freeze the harder．

All this the man knew．The old-timer on Sulphur Creek had told him about it the previous fall，and now he was appreciating the advice．Already all sensation had gone out of his feet．To build the fire he had been forced to remove his mittens，and the fingers had quickly gone numb．His pace of four miles an hour had kept his heart pumping blood to the surface of his body and to all the extremities．But the instant he stopped，the action of the pump eased down．The cold of space smote the unprotected tip of the planet，and he，being on that unprotected tip，received the full force of the blow．The blood of his body recoiled before it．The blood was alive，like the dog，and like the dog it wanted to hide away and cover itself up from the fearful cold．So long as he walked four miles an hour，he pumped that blood，willy-nilly，to the surface；but now it ebbed away and sank down into the recesses of his body．The extremities were the first to feel its absence．His wet feet froze the faster，and his exposed fingers numbed the faster，though they had not yet begun to freeze．Nose and cheeks were already freezing，while the skin of all his body chilled as it lost its blood．

But he was safe．Toes and nose and cheeks would be only touched by the frost，for the fire was beginning to burn with strength．He was feeding it with twigs the size of his finger．In another minute he would be able to feed it with branches the size of his wrist，and then he could remove his wet foot-gear，and，while it dried，he could keep his naked feet warm by the fire，rubbing them at first，of course，with snow．The fire was a success．He was safe．He remembered the advice of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek，and smiled．The old-timer had been very serious in laying down the law that no man must travel alone in the Klondike after fifty below．Well，here he was；he had had the accident；he was alone；and he had saved himself．Those old-timers were rather womanish，some of them，he thought．All a man had to do was to keep his head，and he was all right．Any man who was a man could travel alone．But it was surprising，the rapidity with which his cheeks and nose were freezing．And he had not thought his fingers could go lifeless in so short a time．Lifeless they were，for he could scarcely make them move together to grip a twig，and they seemed remote from his body and from him．When he touched a twig，he had to look and see whether or not he had hold of it．The wires were pretty well down between him and his finger-ends．

All of which counted for little．There was the fire，snapping and crackling and promising life with every dancing flame．He started to untie his moccasins．They were coated with ice；the thick German socks were like sheaths of iron halfway to the knees；and the mocassin strings were like rods of steel all twisted and knotted as by some conflagration．For a moment he tugged with his numb fingers，then，realizing the folly of it，he drew his sheath-knife．

But before he could cut the strings，it happened．It was his own fault or，rather，his mistake．He should not have built the fire under the spruce tree．He should have built it in the open．But it had been easier to pull the twigs from the brush and drop them directly on the fire．Now the tree under which he had done this carried a weight of snow on its boughs．No wind had blown for weeks，and each bough was fully freighted．Each time he had pulled a twig he had communicated a slight agitation to the tree—an imperceptible agitation，so far as he was concerned，but an agitation sufficient to bring about the disaster．High up in the tree one bough capsized its load of snow．This fell on the boughs beneath，capsizing them．This process continued，spreading out and involving the whole tree．It grew like an avalanche，and it descended without warning upon the man and the fire，and the fire was blotted out！Where it had burned was a mantle of fresh and disordered snow．

The man was shocked．It was as though he had just heard his own sentence of death．For a moment he sat and stared at the spot where the fire had been．Then he grew very calm．Perhaps the old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right．If he had only had a trail-mate he would have been in no danger now．The trail-mate could have built the fire．Well，it was up to him to build the fire over again，and this second time there must be no failure．Even if he succeeded，he would most likely lose some toes．His feet must be badly frozen by now，and there would be some time before the second fire was ready．

Such were his thoughts，but he did not sit and think them．He was busy all the time they were passing through his mind，he made a new foundation for a fire，this time in the open；where no treacherous tree could blot it out．Next，he gathered dry grasses and tiny twigs from the high-water flotsam．He could not bring his fingers together to pull them out，but he was able to gather them by the handful．In this way he got many rotten twigs and bits of green moss that were undesirable，but it was the best he could do．He worked methodically，even collecting an armful of the larger branches to be used later when the fire gathered strength．And all the while the dog sat and watched him，a certain yearning wistfulness in its eyes，for it looked upon him as the fire-provider，and the fire was slow in coming．

When all was ready，the man reached in his pocket for a second piece of birch-bark．He knew the bark was there，and，though he could not feel it with his fingers，he could hear its crisp rustling as he fumbled for it．Try as he would，he could not clutch hold of it．And all the time，in his consciousness，was the knowledge that each instant his feet were freezing．This thought tended to put him in a panic，but he fought against it and kept calm．He pulled on his mittens with his teeth，and threshed his arms back and forth，beating his hands with all his might against his sides．He did this sitting down，and he stood up to do it；and all the while the dog sat in the snow，its wolf-brush of a tail curled around warmly over its forefeet，its sharp wolf-ears pricked forward intently as it watched the man．And the man，as he beat and threshed with his arms and hands，felt a great surge of envy as he regarded the creature that was warm and secure in its natural covering．

After a time he was aware of the first faraway signals of sensation in his beaten fingers．The faint tingling grew stronger till it evolved into a stinging ache that was excruciating，but which the man hailed with satisfaction．He stripped the mitten from his right hand and fetched forth the birch-bark．The exposed fingers were quickly going numb again．Next he brought out his bunch of sulphur matches．But the tremendous cold had already driven the life out of his fingers．In his effort to separate one match from the others，the whole bunch fell in the snow．He tried to pick it out of the snow，but failed．The dead fingers could neither touch nor clutch．He was very careful．He drove the thought of his freezing feet，and nose，and cheeks，out of his mind，devoting his whole soul to the matches．He watched，using the sense of vision in place of that of touch，and when he saw his fingers on each side the bunch，he closed them—that is，he willed to close them，for the wires were down，and the fingers did not obey．He pulled the mitten on the right hand，and beat it fiercely against his knee．Then，with both mittened hands，he scooped the bunch of matches，along with much snow，into his lap．Yet he was no better off．

After some manipulation he managed to get the bunch between the heels of his mittened hands．In this fashion he carried it to his mouth．The ice crackled and snapped when by a violent effort he opened his mouth．He drew the lower jaw in，curled the upper lip out of the way，and scraped the bunch with his upper teeth in order to separate a match．He succeeded in getting one，which he dropped on his lap．He was no better off．He could not pick it up．Then he devised a way．He picked it up in his teeth and scratched it on his leg．Twenty times he scratched before he succeeded in lighting it．As it flamed he held it with his teeth to the birch-bark．But the burning brimstone went up his nostrils and into his lungs，causing him to cough spasmodically．The match fell into the snow and went out．

The old-timer on Sulphur Creek was right，he thought in the moment of controlled despair that ensued：after fifty below，a man should travel with a partner．He beat his hands，but failed in exciting any sensation．Suddenly he bared both hands，removing the mittens with his teeth．He caught the whole bunch between the heels of his hands．His arm-muscles not being frozen enabled him to press the hand-heels tightly against the matches．Then he scratched the bunch along his leg．It flared into flame，seventy sulphur matches at once！There was no wind to blow them out．He kept his head to one side to escape the strangling fumes，and held the blazing bunch to the birch-bark．As he so held it，he became aware of sensation in his hand．His flesh was burning．He could smell it．Deep down below the surface he could feel it．The sensation developed into pain that grew acute．And still he endured it，holding the flame of the matches clumsily to the bark that would not light readily because his own burning hands were in the way，absorbing most of the flame．

At last，when he could endure no more，he jerked his hands apart．The blazing matches fell sizzling into the snow，but the birch-bark was alight．He began laying dry grasses and the tiniest twigs on the flame．He could not pick and choose，for he had to lift the fuel between the heels of his hands．Small pieces of rotten wood and green moss clung to the twigs，and he bit them off as well as he could with his teeth．He cherished the flame carefully and awkwardly．It meant life，and it must not perish．The withdrawal of blood from the surface of his body now made him begin to shiver，and he grew more awkward．A large piece of green moss fell squarely on the little fire．He tried to poke it out with his fingers，but his shivering frame made him poke too far，and he disrupted the nucleus of the little fire，the burning grasses and tiny twigs separating and scattering．He tried to poke them together again，but in spite of the tenseness of the effort，his shivering got away with him，and the twigs were hopelessly scattered．Each twig gushed a puff of smoke and went out．The fire-provider had failed．As he looked apathetically about him，his eyes chanced on the dog，sitting across the ruins of the fire from him，in the snow，making restless，hunching movements，slightly lifting one forefoot and then the other，shifting its weight back and forth on them with wistful eagerness．

The sight of the dog put a wild idea into his head．He remembered the tale of the man，caught in a blizzard，who killed a steer and crawled inside the carcass，and so was saved．He would kill the dog and bury his hands in the warm body until the numbness went out of them．Then he could build another fire．He spoke to the dog，calling it to him；but in his voice was a strange note of fear that frightened the animal，who had never known the man to speak in such way before．Something was the matter，and its suspicious nature sensed danger—it knew not what danger，but somewhere，somehow，in its brain arose an apprehension of the man．It flattened its ears down at the sound of the man's voice，and its restless，hunching movements and the liftings and shiftings of its forefeet became more pronounced but it would not come to the man．He got on his hands and knees and crawled toward the dog．This unusual posture again excited suspicion，and the animal sidled mincingly away．

The man sat up in the snow for a moment and struggled for calmness．Then he pulled on his mittens，by means of his teeth，and got upon his feet．He glanced down at first in order to assure himself that he was really standing up，for the absence of sensation in his feet left him unrelated to the earth．His erect position in itself started to drive the webs of suspicion from the dog's mind；and when he spoke peremptorily，with the sound of whip-lashes in his voice，the dog rendered its customary allegiance and came to him．As it came within reaching distance，the man lost his control．His arms flashed out to the dog，and he experienced genuine surprise when he discovered that his hands could not clutch，that there was neither bend nor feeling in the fingers．He had forgotten for the moment that they were frozen and that they were freezing more and more．All this happened quickly，and before the animal could get away，he encircled its body with his arms．He sat down in the snow，and in this fashion held the dog，while it snarled and whined and struggled．

But it was all he could do，hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there．He realized that he could not kill the dog．There was no way to do it．With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor throttle the animal．He released it，and it plunged wildly away，with tail between its legs，and still snarling．It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously，with ears sharply pricked forward．The man looked down at his hands in order to locate them，and found them hanging on the ends of his arms．It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were．He began threshing his arms back and forth，beating the mittened hands against his sides．He did this for five minutes，violently，and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface to put a stop to his shivering．But no sensation was aroused in the hands．He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms，but when he tried to run the impression down，he could not find it．

A certain fear of death，dull and oppressive，came to him．This fear quickly became poignant as he realized that it was no longer a mere matter of freezing his fingers and toes，or of losing his hands and feet，but that it was a matter of life and death with the chances against him．This threw him into a panic，and he turned and ran up the creek-bed along the old，dim trail．The dog joined in behind and kept up with him．He ran blindly，without intention，in fear such as he had never known in his life．Slowly，as he ploughed and floundered through the snow，he began to see things again，—the banks of the creek，the old timber-jams，the leafless aspens，and the sky．The running made him feel better．He did not shiver．Maybe，if he ran on，his feet would thaw out；and，anyway，if he ran far enough，he would reach camp and the boys．Without doubt he would lose some fingers and toes and some of his face；but the boys would take care of him，and save the rest of him when he got there．And at the same time there was another thought in his mind that said he would never get to the camp and the boys；that it was too many miles away，that the freezing had too great a start on him，and that he would soon be stiff and dead．This thought he kept in the background and refused to consider．Sometimes it pushed itself forward and demanded to be heard，but he thrust it back and strove to think of other things．

It struck him as curious that he could run at all on feet so frozen that he could not feel them when they struck the earth and took the weight of his body．He seemed to himself to skim along above the surface，and to have no connection with the earth．Somewhere he had once seen a winged Mercury，and he wondered if Mercury felt as he felt when skimming over the earth．

His theory of running until he reached camp and the boys had one flaw in it：he lacked the endurance．Several times he stumbled，and finally he tottered，crumpled up，and fell．When he tried to rise，he failed．He must sit and rest，he decided，and next time he would merely walk and keep on going．As he sat and regained his breath，he noted that he was feeling quite warm and comfortable．He was not shivering，and it even seemed that a warm glow had come to his chest and trunk．And yet，when he touched his nose or cheeks，there was no sensation．Running would not thaw them out．Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet．Then the thought came to him that the frozen portions of his body must be extending．He tried to keep this thought down，to forget it，to think of something else；he was aware of the panicky feeling that it caused，and he was afraid of the panic．But the thought asserted itself，and persisted，until it produced a vision of his body totally frozen．This was too much，and he made another wild run along the trail．Once he slowed down to a walk，but the thought of the freezing extending itself made him run again．

And all the time the dog ran with him，at his heels．When he fell down a second time，it curled its tail over its forefeet and sat in front of him facing him curiously eager and intent．The warmth and security of the animal angered him，and he cursed it till it flattened down its ears appeasingly．This time the shivering came more quickly upon the man．He was losing in his battle with the frost．It was creeping into his body from all sides．The thought of it drove him on，but he ran no more than a hundred feet，when he staggered and pitched headlong．It was his last panic．When he had recovered his breath and control，he sat up and entertained in his mind the conception of meeting death with dignity．However，the conception did not come to him in such terms．His idea of it was that he had been making a fool of himself，running around like a chicken with its head cut off—such was the simile that occurred to him．Well，he was bound to freeze anyway，and he might as well take it decently．With this new-found peace of mind came the first glimmerings of drowsiness．A good idea，he thought，to sleep off to death．It was like taking an anæsthetic．Freezing was not so bad as people thought．There were lots worse ways to die．

He pictured the boys finding his body next day．Suddenly he found himself with them，coming along the trail and looking for himself．And，still with them，he came around a turn in the trail and found himself lying in the snow．He did not belong with himself any more，for even then he was out of himself，standing with the boys and looking at himself in the snow．It certainly was cold，was his thought．When he got back to the States he could tell the folks what real cold was．He drifted on from this to a vision of the old-timer on Sulphur Creek．He could see him quite clearly，warm and comfortable，and smoking a pipe．

“You were right，old hoss；you were right，”the man mumbled to the old-timer of Sulphur Creek．

Then the man drowsed off into what seemed to him the most comfortable and satisfying sleep he had ever known．The dog sat facing him and waiting．The brief day drew to a close in a long，slow twilight．There were no signs of a fire to be made，and，besides，never in the dog's experience had it known a man to sit like that in the snow and make no fire．As the twilight drew on，its eager yearning for the fire mastered it，and with a great lifting and shifting of forefeet，it whined softly，then flattened its ears down in anticipation of being chidden by the man．But the man remained silent．Later，the dog whined loudly．And still later it crept close to the man and caught the scent of death．This made the animal bristle and back away．A little longer it delayed，howling under the stars that leaped and danced and shone brightly in the cold sky．Then it turned and trotted up the trail in the direction of the camp it knew，where were the other food-providers and fire-providers．





All Gold Canyon


It was the green heart of the canyon，where the walls swerved back from the rigid plan and relieved their harshness of line by making a little sheltered nook and filling it to the brim with sweetness and roundness and softness．Here all things rested．Even the narrow stream ceased its turbulent down-rush long enough to form a quiet pool．Knee-deep in the water，with drooping head and half-shut eyes，drowsed a red-coated，many-antlered buck．

On one side，beginning at the very lip of the pool，was a tiny meadow，a cool，resilient surface of green that extended to the base of the frowning wall．Beyond the pool a gentle slope of earth ran up and up to meet the opposing wall．Fine grass covered the slope—grass that was spangled with flowers，with here and there patches of color，orange and purple and golden．Below，the canyon was shut in．There was no view．The walls leaned together abruptly and the canyon ended in a chaos of rocks，moss-covered and hidden by a green screen of vines and creepers and boughs of trees．Up the canyon rose far hills and peaks，the big foot-hills，pine-covered and remote．And far beyond，like clouds upon the border of the sky，towered minarets of white，where the Sierra's eternal snows flashed austerely the blazes of the sun．

There was no dust in the canyon．The leaves and flowers were clean and virginal．The grass was young velvet．Over the pool three cottonwoods sent their snowy fluffs fluttering down the quiet air．On the slope the blossoms of the wine-wooded manzanita filled the air with springtime odors，while the leaves，wise with experience，were already beginning their vertical twist against the coming aridity of summer．In the open spaces on the slope，beyond the farthest shadow-reach of the manzanita，poised the mariposa lilies，like so many flights of jewelled moths suddenly arrested and on the verge of trembling into flight again．Here and there that woods harlequin，the madrone，permitting itself to be caught in the act of changing its pea-green trunk to madder-red，breathed its fragrance into the air from great clusters of waxen bells．Creamy white were these bells，shaped like lilies-of-the-valley，with the sweetness of perfume that is of the springtime．

There was not a sigh of wind．The air was drowsy with its weight of perfume．It was a sweetness that would have been cloying had the air been heavy and humid．But the air was sharp and thin．It was as starlight transmuted into atmosphere，shot through and warmed by sunshine，and flower-drenched with sweetness．

An occasional butterfly drifted in and out through the patches of light and shade．And from all about rose the low and sleepy hum of mountain bees—feasting Sybarites that jostled one another good-naturedly at the board，nor found time for rough discourtesy．So quietly did the little stream drip and ripple its way through the canyon that it spoke only in faint and occasional gurgles．The voice of the stream was as a drowsy whisper，ever interrupted by dozings and silences，ever lifted again in the awakenings．

The motion of all things was a drifting in the heart of the canyon．Sunshine and butterflies drifted in and out among the trees．The hum of the bees and the whisper of the stream were a drifting of sound．And the drifting sound and drifting color seemed to weave together in the making of a delicate and intangible fabric which was the spirit of the place．It was a spirit of peace that was not of death，but of smooth-pulsing life，of quietude that was not silence，of movement that was not action，of repose that was quick with existence without being violent with struggle and travail．The spirit of the place was the spirit of the peace of the living，somnolent with the easement and content of prosperity，and undisturbed by rumors of far wars．

The red-coated，many-antlered buck acknowledged the lordship of the spirit of the place and dozed knee-deep in the cool，shaded pool．There seemed no flies to vex him and he was languid with rest．Sometimes his ears moved when the stream awoke and whispered；but they moved lazily，with foreknowledge that it was merely the stream grown garrulous at discovery that it had slept．

But there came a time when the buck's ears lifted and tensed with swift eagerness for sound．His head was turned down the canyon．His sensitive，quivering nostrils scented the air．His eyes could not pierce the green screen through which the stream rippled away，but to his ears came the voice of a man．It was a steady，monotonous，singsong voice．Once the buck heard the harsh clash of metal upon rock．At the sound he snorted with a sudden start that jerked him through the air from water to meadow，and his feet sank into the young velvet，while he pricked his ears and again scented the air．Then he stole across the tiny meadow，pausing once and again to listen，and faded away out of the canyon like a wraith，soft-footed and without sound．

The clash of steel-shod soles against the rocks began to be heard，and the man's voice grew louder．It was raised in a sort of chant and became distinct with nearness，so that the words could be heard：

Tu'n around an' tu'n yo' face

Untoe them sweet hills of grace

（D'pow'rs of sin yo'am scornin'！）．

Look about an' look aroun'，

Fling yo'sin-pack on d'groun'

（Yo'will meet wid d'Lord in d'mornin！）．

A sound of scrambling accompanied the song，and the spirit of the place fled away on the heels of the red-coated buck．The green screen was burst asunder，and a man peered out at the meadow and the pool and the sloping side-hill．He was a deliberate sort of man．He took in the scene with one embracing glance，then ran his eyes over the details to verify the general impression．Then，and not until then，did he open his mouth in vivid and solemn approval：

“Smoke of life an'snakes of purgatory！Will you just look at that！Wood an'water an'grass an'a side-hill！A pocket-hunter's delight an'a cayuse's paradise！Cool green for tired eyes！Pink pills for pale people ain't in it．A secret pasture for prospectors and a resting-place for tired burros，by damn！”

He was a sandy-complexioned man in whose face geniality and humor seemed the salient characteristics．It was a mobile face，quick-changing to inward mood and thought．Thinking was in him a visible process．Ideas chased across his face like wind-flaws across the surface of a lake．His hair，sparse and unkempt of growth，was as indeterminate and colorless as his complexion．It would seem that all the color of his frame had gone into his eyes，for they were startlingly blue．Also，they were laughing and merry eyes，within them much of the naïveté and wonder of the child；and yet，in an unassertive way，they contained much of calm self-reliance and strength of purpose founded upon self-experience and experience of the world．

From out the screen of vines and creepers he flung ahead of him a miner's pick and shovel and gold-pan．Then he crawled out himself into the open．He was clad in faded overalls and black cotton shirt，with hobnailed brogans on his feet，and on his head a hat whose shapelessness and stains advertised the rough usage of wind and rain and sun and camp-smoke．He stood erect，seeing wide-eyed the secrecy of the scene and sensuously inhaling the warm，sweet breath of the canyon-garden through nostrils that dilated and quivered with delight．His eyes narrowed to laughing slits of blue，his face wreathed itself in joy，and his mouth curled in a smile as he cried aloud：

“Jumping dandelions and happy hollyhocks，but that smells good to me！Talk about your attar o'roses an'cologne factories！They ain't in it！”

He had the habit of soliloquy．His quick-changing facial expressions might tell every thought and mood，but the tongue，perforce，ran hard after，repeating，like a second Boswell．

The man lay down on the lip of the pool and drank long and deep of its water．“Tastes good to me，”he murmured，lifting his head and gazing across the pool at the side-hill，while he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand．The side-hill attracted his attention．Still lying on his stomach，he studied the hill formation long and carefully．It was a practised eye that travelled up the slope to the crumbling canyon-wall and back and down again to the edge of the pool．He scrambled to his feet and favored the side-hill with a second survey．

“Looks good to me，”he concluded，picking up his pick and shovel and gold-pan．

He crossed the stream below the pool，stepping agilely from stone to stone．Where the side-hill touched the water he dug up a shovelful of dirt and put it into the gold-pan．He squatted down，holding the pan in his two hands，and partly immersing it in the stream．Then he imparted to the pan a deft circular motion that sent the water sluicing in and out through the dirt and gravel．The larger and the lighter particles worked to the surface，and these，by a skilful dipping movement of the pan，he spilled out and over the edge．Occasionally，to expedite matters，he rested the pan and with his fingers raked out the large pebbles and pieces of rock．

The contents of the pan diminished rapidly until only fine dirt and the smallest bits of gravel remained．At this stage he began to work very deliberately and carefully．It was fine washing，and he washed fine and finer，with a keen scrutiny and delicate and fastidious touch．At last the pan seemed empty of everything but water；but with a quick semicircular flirt that sent the water flying over the shallow rim into the stream，he disclosed a layer of black sand on the bottom of the pan．So thin was this layer that it was like a streak of paint．He examined it closely．In the midst of it was a tiny golden speck．He dribbled a little water in over the depressed edge of the pan．With a quick flirt he sent the water sluicing across the bottom，turning the grains of black sand over and over．A second tiny golden speck rewarded his effort．

The washing had now become very fine—fine beyond all need of ordinary placer-mining．He worked the black sand，a small portion at a time，up the shallow rim of the pan．Each small portion he examined sharply，so that his eyes saw every grain of it before he allowed it to slide over the edge and away．Jealously，bit by bit，he let the black sand slip away．A golden speck，no larger than a pin-point，appeared on the rim，and by his manipulation of the water it returned to the bottom of the pan．And in such fashion another speck was disclosed，and another．Great was his care of them．Like a shepherd he herded his flock of golden specks so that not one should be lost．At last，of the pan of dirt nothing remained but his golden herd．He counted it，and then，after all his labor，sent it flying out of the pan with one final swirl of water．

But his blue eyes were shining with desire as he rose to his feet．“Seven，”he muttered aloud，asserting the sum of the specks for which he had toiled so hard and which he had so wantonly thrown away．“Seven，”he repeated，with the emphasis of one trying to impress a number on his memory．

He stood still a long while，surveying the hillside．In his eyes was a curiosity，new-aroused and burning．There was an exultance about his bearing and a keenness like that of a hunting animal catching the fresh scent of game．

He moved down the stream a few steps and took a second panful of dirt．

Again came the careful washing，the jealous herding of the golden specks，and the wantonness with which he sent them flying into the stream when he had counted their number．

“Five，”he muttered，and repeated，“five．”

He could not forbear another survey of the hill before filling the pan farther down the stream．His golden herds diminished．“Four，three，two，two，one，”were his memory-tabulations as he moved down the stream．When but one speck of gold rewarded his washing，he stopped and built a fire of dry twigs．Into this he thrust the gold-pan and burned it till it was blue-black．He held up the pan and examined it critically．Then he nodded approbation．Against such a color-background he could defy the tiniest yellow speck to elude him．

Still moving down the stream，he panned again．A single speck was his reward．A third pan contained no gold at all．Not satisfied with this，he panned three times again，taking his shovels of dirt within a foot of one another．Each pan proved empty of gold，and the fact，instead of discouraging him，seemed to give him satisfaction．His elation increased with each barren washing，until he arose，exclaiming jubilantly：

“If it ain't the real thing，may God knock off my head with sour apples！”

Returning to where he had started operations，he began to pan up the stream．At first his golden herds increased—increased prodigiously．“Fourteen，eighteen，twenty-one，twenty-six，”ran his memory tabulations．Just above the pool he struck his richest pan—thirty-five colors．

“Almost enough to save，”he remarked regretfully as he allowed the water to sweep them away．

The sun climbed to the top of the sky．The man worked on．Pan by pan，he went up the stream，the tally of results steadily decreasing．

“It's just booful，the way it peters out，”he exulted when a shovelful of dirt contained no more than a single speck of gold．And when no specks at all were found in several pans，he straightened up and favored the hillside with a confident glance．

“Ah，ha！Mr．Pocket！”he cried out，as though to an auditor hidden somewhere above him beneath the surface of the slope．“Ah，ha！Mr．Pocket！I'm a-comin'，I'm a-comin'，an'I'm shorely gwine to get yer！You heah me，Mr．Pocket？I'm gwine to get yer as shore as punkins ain't cauliflowers！”

He turned and flung a measuring glance at the sun poised above him in the azure of the cloudless sky．Then he went down the canyon，following the line of shovel-holes he had made in filling the pans．He crossed the stream below the pool and disappeared through the green screen．There was little opportunity for the spirit of the place to return with its quietude and repose，for the man's voice，raised in ragtime song，still dominated the canyon with possession．

After a time，with a greater clashing of steel-shod feet on rock，he returned．The green screen was tremendously agitated．It surged back and forth in the throes of a struggle．There was a loud grating and clanging of metal．The man's voice leaped to a higher pitch and was sharp with imperativeness．A large body plunged and panted．There was a snapping and ripping and rending，and amid a shower of falling leaves a horse burst through the screen．On its back was a pack，and from this trailed broken vines and torn creepers．The animal gazed with astonished eyes at the scene into which it had been precipitated，then dropped its head to the grass and began contentedly to graze．A second horse scrambled into view，slipping once on the mossy rocks and regaining equilibrium when its hoofs sank into the yielding surface of the meadow．It was riderless，though on its back was a high-horned Mexican saddle，scarred and discolored by long usage．

The man brought up the rear．He threw off pack and saddle，with an eye to camp location，and gave the animals their freedom to graze．He unpacked his food and got out frying-pan and coffee-pot．He gathered an armful of dry wood，and with a few stones made a place for his fire．

“My！”he said，“but I've got an appetite．I could scoff iron-filings an'horseshoe nails an'thank you kindly，ma'am，for a second helpin'．”

He straightened up，and，while he reached for matches in the pocket of his overalls，his eyes travelled across the pool to the side-hill．His fingers had clutched the match-box，but they relaxed their hold and the hand came out empty．The man wavered perceptibly．He looked at his preparations for cooking and he looked at the hill．

“Guess I'll take another whack at her，”he concluded，starting to cross the stream．

“They ain't no sense in it，I know，”he mumbled apologetically．“But keepin grub back an hour ain't goin' to hurt none，I reckon．”

A few feet back from his first line of test-pans he started a second line．The sun dropped down the western sky，the shadows lengthened，but the man worked on．He began a third line of test-pans．He was cross-cutting the hillside，line by line，as he ascended．The center of each line produced the richest pans，while the ends came where no colors showed in the pan．And as he ascended the hillside the lines grew perceptibly shorter．The regularity with which their length diminished served to indicate that somewhere up the slope the last line would be so short as to have scarcely length at all，and that beyond could come only a point．The design was growing into an inverted “V．”The converging sides of this “V”marked the boundaries of the gold-bearing dirt．

The apex of the “V”was evidently the man's goal．Often he ran his eye along the converging sides and on up the hill，trying to divine the apex，the point where the gold-bearing dirt must cease．Here resided “Mr．Pocket—”for so the man familiarly addressed the imaginary point above him on the slope，crying out：

“Come down out o'that，Mr．Pocket！Be right smart an'agreeable，an'come down！”

“All right，”he would add later，in a voice resigned to determi-nation．“All right，Mr．Pocket．It's plain to me I got to come right up an'snatch you out bald-headed．An'I'll do it！I'll do it！”he would threaten still later．

Each pan he carried down to the water to wash，and as he went higher up the hill the pans grew richer，until he began to save the gold in an empty baking-powder can which he carried carelessly in his hip-pocket．So engrossed was he in his toil that he did not notice the long twilight of oncoming night．It was not until he tried vainly to see the gold colors in the bottom of the pan that he realized the passage of time．He straightened up abruptly．An expression of whimsical wonderment and awe overspread his face as he drawled：

“Gosh darn my buttons！if I didn't plumb forget dinner！”

He stumbled across the stream in the darkness and lighted his long-delayed fire．Flapjacks and bacon and warmed-over beans constituted his supper．Then he smoked a pipe by the smouldering coals，listening to the night noises and watching the moonlight stream through the canyon．After that he unrolled his bed，took off his heavy shoes，and pulled the blankets up to his chin．His face showed white in the moonlight，like the face of a corpse．But it was a corpse that knew its resurrection，for the man rose suddenly on one elbow and gazed across at his hillside．

“Good night，Mr．Pocket，”he called sleepily．“Good night．”

He slept through the early gray of morning until the direct rays of the sun smote his closed eyelids，when he awoke with a start and looked about him until he had established the continuity of his existence and identified his present self with the days previously lived．

To dress，he had merely to buckle on his shoes．He glanced at his fireplace and at his hillside，wavered，but fought down the temptation and started the fire．

“Keep yer shirt on，Bill；keep yer shirt on，”he admonished himself．“What's the good of rushin'？No use in gettin' all het up an'sweaty．Mr．Pocket'll wait for you．He ain't a-runnin' away before you can get yer breakfast．Now，what you want，Bill，is something fresh in yer bill o'fare．So it's up to you to go an'get it．”

He cut a short pole at the water's edge and drew from one of his pockets a bit of line and a draggled fly that had once been a royal coachman．

“Mebbe they'll bite in the early morning，”he muttered，as he made his first cast into the pool．And a moment later he was gleefully crying：“What'd I tell you，eh？What'd I tell you？”

He had no reel，nor any inclination to waste time，and by main strength，and swiftly，he drew out of the water a flashing ten-inch trout．Three more，caught in rapid succession，furnished his breakfast．When he came to the stepping-stones on his way to his hillside，he was struck by a sudden thought，and paused．

“I'd just better take a hike down-stream a ways，”he said．“There's no tellin' what cuss may be snoopin' around．”

But he crossed over on the stones，and with a “I really oughter take that hike，”the need of the precaution passed out of his mind and he fell to work．

At nightfall he straightened up．The small of his back was stiff from stooping toil，and as he put his hand behind him to soothe the protesting muscles，he said：

“Now what d'ye think of that，by damn？I clean forgot my dinner again！If I don't watch out，I'll sure be degeneratin' into a two-meal-a-day crank．”

“Pockets is the damnedest things I ever see for makin' a man absent-minded，”he communed that night，as he crawled into his blankets．Nor did he forget to call up the hillside，“Good night，Mr．Pocket！Good night！”

Rising with the sun，and snatching a hasty breakfast，he was early at work．A fever seemed to be growing in him，nor did the increasing richness of the test-pans allay this fever．There was a flush in his cheek other than that made by the heat of the sun，and he was oblivious to fatigue and the passage of time．When he filled a pan with dirt，he ran down the hill to wash it；nor could he forbear running up the hill again，panting and stumbling profanely，to refill the pan．

He was now a hundred yards from the water，and the inverted “V”was assuming definite proportions．The width of the pay-dirt steadily decreased，and the man extended in his mind's eye the sides of the “V”to their meeting-place far up the hill．This was his goal，the apex of the “V，”and he panned many times to locate it．

“Just about two yards above that manzanita bush an'a yard to the right，”he finally concluded．

Then the temptation seized him．“As plain as the nose on your face，”he said，as he abandoned his laborious cross-cutting and climbed to the indicated apex．He filled a pan and carried it down the hill to wash．It contained no trace of gold．He dug deep，and he dug shallow，filling and washing a dozen pans，and was unrewarded even by the tiniest golden speck．He was enraged at having yielded to the temptation，and cursed himself blasphemously and pridelessly．Then he went down the hill and took up the cross-cutting．

“Slow an'certain，Bill；slow an'certain，”he crooned．“Short-cuts to fortune ain't in your line，an'it's about time you know it．Get wise，Bill；get wise．Slow an'certain's the only hand you can play；so go to it，an'keep to it，too．”

As the cross-cuts decreased，showing that the sides of the “V”were converging，the depth of the “V”increased．The gold-trace was dipping into the hill．It was only at thirty inches beneath the surface that he could get colors in his pan．The dirt he found at twenty-five inches from the surface，and at thirty-five inches' yielded barren pans．At the base of the “V，”by the water's edge，he had found the gold colors at the grass roots．The higher he went up the hill，the deeper the gold dipped．To dig a hole three feet deep in order to get one test-pan was a task of no mean magnitude；while between the man and the apex intervened an untold number of such holes to be dug．“An'there's no tellin' how much deeper it'll pitch，”he sighed，in a moment's pause，while his fingers soothed his aching back．

Feverish with desire，with aching back and stiffening muscles，with pick and shovel gouging and mauling the soft brown earth，the man toiled up the hill．Before him was the smooth slope，spangled with flowers and made sweet with their breath．Behind him was devastation．It looked like some terrible eruption breaking out on the smooth skin of the hill．His slow progress was like that of a slug，befouling beauty with a monstrous trail．

Though the dipping gold-trace increased the man's work，he found consolation in the increasing richness of the pans．Twenty cents，thirty cents，fifty cents，sixty cents，were the values of the gold found in the pans，and at nightfall he washed his banner pan，which gave him a dollar's worth of gold-dust from a shovelful of dirt．

“I'll just bet it's my luck to have some inquisitive cuss come buttin' in here on my pasture，”he mumbled sleepily that night as he pulled the blankets up to his chin．

Suddenly he sat upright．“Bill！”he called sharply．“Now，listen to me，Bill；d'ye hear！It's up to you，to-morrow mornin'，to mosey round an'see what you can see．Understand？Tomorrow morning，an'don't you forget it！”

He yawned and glanced across at his side-hill．“Good night，Mr．Pocket，”he called．

In the morning he stole a march on the sun，for he had finished breakfast when its first rays caught him，and he was climbing the wall of the canyon where it crumbled away and gave footing．From the outlook at the top he found himself in the midst of loneliness．As far as he could see，chain after chain of mountains heaved themselves into his vision．To the east his eyes，leaping the miles between range and range and between many ranges，brought up at last against the white-peaked Sierras—the main crest，where the backbone of the Western world reared itself against the sky．To the north and south he could see more distinctly the cross-systems that broke through the main trend of the sea of mountains．To the west the ranges fell away，one behind the other，diminishing and fading into the gentle foothills that，in turn，descended into the great valley which he could not see．

And in all that mighty sweep of earth he saw no sign of man nor of the handiwork of man—save only the torn bosom of the hillside at his feet．The man looked long and carefully．Once，far down his own canyon，he thought he saw in the air a faint hint of smoke．He looked again and decided that it was the purple haze of the hills made dark by a convolution of the canyon wall at its back．

“Hey，you，Mr．Pocket！”he called down into the canyon．“Stand out from under！I'm a-comin'，Mr．Pocket！I'm a-comin'！”

The heavy brogans on the man's feet made him appear clumsy-footed，but he swung down from the giddy height as lightly and airily as a mountain goat．A rock，turning under his foot on the edge of the precipice，did not disconcert him．He seemed to know the precise time required for the turn to culminate in disaster，and in the meantime he utilized the false footing itself for the momentary earth-contact necessary to carry him on into safety．Where the earth sloped so steeply that it was impossible to stand for a second upright，the man did not hesitate．His foot pressed the impossible surface for but a fraction of the fatal second and gave him the bound that carried him onward．Again，where even the fraction of a second's footing was out of the question，he would swing his body past by a moment's hand-grip on a jutting knob of rock，a crevice，or a precariously rooted shrub．At last，with a wild leap and yell，he exchanged the face of the wall for an earth-slide and finished the descent in the midst of several tons of sliding earth and gravel．

His first pan of the morning washed out over two dollars in coarse gold．It was from the centre of the “V．”To either side the diminution in the values of the pans was swift．His lines of cross-cutting holes were growing very short．The converging sides of the inverted “V”were only a few yards apart．Their meeting-point was only a few yards above him．But the pay-streak was dipping deeper and deeper into the earth．By early afternoon he was sinking the test-holes five feet before the pans could show the gold-trace．

For that matter，the gold-trace had become something more than a trace；it was a placer mine in itself，and the man resolved to come back after he had found the pocket and work over the ground．But the increasing richness of the pans began to worry him．By late afternoon the worth of the pans had grown to three and four dollars．The man scratched his head perplexedly and looked a few feet up the hill at the manzanita bush that marked approximately the apex of the “V．”He nodded his head and said oracularly：

“It's one o'two things，Bill：one o'two things．Either Mr．Pocket's spilled himself all out an'down the hill，or else Mr．Pocket's that damned rich you maybe won't be able to carry him all away with you．And that'd be hell，wouldn't it，now？”He chuckled at contemplation of so pleasant a dilemma．

Nightfall found him by the edge of the stream，his eyes wrestling with the gathering darkness over the washing of a five-dollar pan．

“Wisht I had an electric light to go on working，”he said．

He found sleep difficult that night．Many times he composed himself and closed his eyes for slumber to overtake him；but his blood pounded with too strong desire，and as many times his eyes opened and he murmured wearily，“Wisht it was sun-up．”

Sleep came to him in the end，but his eyes were open with the first paling of the stars，and the gray of dawn caught him with breakfast finished and climbing the hillside in the direction of the secret abiding-place of Mr．Pocket．

The first cross-cut the man made，there was space for only three holes，so narrow had become the pay-streak and so close was he to the fountainhead of the golden stream he had been following for four days．

“Be ca'm，Bill；be ca'm，”he admonished himself，as he broke ground for the final hole where the sides of the “V”had at last come together in a point．

“I've got the almighty cinch on you，Mr．Pocket，an'you can't lose me，”he said many times as he sank the hole deeper and deeper．

Four feet，five feet，six feet，he dug his way down into the earth．The digging grew harder．His pick grated on broken rock．He examined the rock．

“Rotten quartz，”was his conclusion as，with the shovel，he cleared the bottom of the hole of loose dirt．He attacked the crumbling quartz with the pick，bursting the disintegrating rock asunder with every stroke．He thrust his shovel into the loose mass．His eye caught a gleam of yellow．He dropped the shovel and squatted suddenly on his heels．As a farmer rubs the clinging earth from fresh-dug potatoes，so the man，a piece of rotten quartz held in both hands，rubbed the dirt away．

“Sufferin' Sardanopolis！”he cried．“Lumps an'chunks of it！Lumps an'chunks of it！”

It was only half rock he held in his hand．The other half was virgin gold．He dropped it into his pan and examined another piece．Little yellow was to be seen，but with his strong fingers he crumbled the rotten quartz away till both hands were filled with glowing yellow．He rubbed the dirt away from fragment after fragment，tossing them into the gold-pan．It was a treasure-hole．So much had the quartz rotted away that there was less of it than there was of gold．Now and again he found a piece to which no rock clung—a piece that was all gold．A chunk，where the pick had laid open the heart of the gold，glittered like a handful of yellow jewels，and he cocked his head at it and slowly turned it around and over to observe the rich play of the light upon it．

“Talk about yer Too Much Gold diggin's！”the man snorted contemptuously．“Why，this diggin' 'd make it look like thirty cents．This diggin' is All Gold．An'right here an'now I name this yere canyon ‘All Gold Canyon，' b'gosh！”

Still squatting on his heels，he continued examining the fragments and tossing them into the pan．Suddenly there came to him a premonition of danger．It seemed a shadow had fallen upon him．But there was no shadow．His heart had given a great jump up into his throat and was choking him．Then his blood slowly chilled and he felt the sweat of his shirt cold against his flesh．

He did not spring up nor look around．He did not move．He was considering the nature of the premonition he had received，trying to locate the source of the mysterious force that had warned him，striving to sense the imperative presence of the unseen thing that threatened him．

There is an aura of things hostile，made manifest by messengers too refined for the senses to know；and this aura he felt，but knew not how he felt it．His was the feeling as when a cloud passes over the sun．It seemed that between him and life had passed something dark and smothering and menacing；a gloom，as it were，that swallowed up life and made for death—his death．

Every force of his being impelled him to spring up and confront the unseen danger，but his soul dominated the panic，and he remained squatting on his heels，in his hands a chunk of gold．He did not dare to look around，but he knew by now that there was something behind him and above him．He made believe to be interested in the gold in his hand．He examined it critically，turned it over and over，and rubbed the dirt from it．And all the time he knew that something behind him was looking at the gold over his shoulder．

Still feigning interest in the chunk of gold in his hand，he listened intently and he heard the breathing of the thing behind him．His eyes searched the ground in front of him for a weapon，but they saw only the uprooted gold，worthless to him now in his extremity．There was his pick，a handy weapon on occasion；but this was not such an occasion．The man realized his predicament．He was in a narrow hole that was seven feet deep．His head did not come to the surface of the ground．He was in a trap．

He remained squatting on his heels．He was quite cool and collected；but his mind，considering every factor，showed him only his helplessness．He continued rubbing the dirt from the quartz fragments and throwing the gold into the pan．There was nothing else for him to do．Yet he knew that he would have to rise up，sooner or later，and face the danger that breathed at his back．The minutes passed，and with the passage of each minute he knew that by so much he was nearer the time when he must stand up，or else—and his wet shirt went cold against his flesh again at the thought—or else he might receive death as he stooped there over his treasure．

Still he squatted on his heels，rubbing dirt from gold and debating in just what manner he should rise up．He might rise up with a rush and claw his way out of the hole to meet whatever threatened on the even footing above ground．Or he might rise up slowly and carelessly，and feign casually to discover the thing that breathed at his back．His instinct and every fighting fibre of his body favored the mad，clawing rush to the surface．His intellect，and the craft thereof，favored the slow and cautious meeting with the thing that menaced and which he could not see．And while he debated，a loud，crashing noise burst on his ear．At the same instant he received a stunning blow on the left side of the back，and from the point of impact felt a rush of flame through his flesh．He sprang up in the air，but halfway to his feet collapsed．His body crumpled in like a leaf withered in sudden heat，and he came down，his chest across his pan of gold，his face in the dirt and rock，his legs tangled and twisted because of the restricted space at the bottom of the hole．His legs twitched convulsively several times．His body was shaken as with a mighty ague．There was a slow expansion of the lungs，accompanied by a deep sigh．Then the air was slowly，very slowly，exhaled，and his body as slowly flattened itself down into inertness．

Above，revolver in hand，a man was peering down over the edge of the hole．He peered for a long time at the prone and motionless body beneath him．After a while the stranger sat down on the edge of the hole so that he could see into it，and rested the revolver on his knee．Reaching his hand into a pocket，he drew out a wisp of brown paper．Into this he dropped a few crumbs of tobacco．The combination became a cigarette，brown and squat，with the ends turned in．Not once did he take his eyes from the body at the bottom of the hole．He lighted the cigarette and drew its smoke into his lungs with a caressing intake of the breath．He smoked slowly．Once the cigarette went out and he relighted it．And all the while he studied the body beneath him．

In the end he tossed the cigarette stub away and rose to his feet．He moved to the edge of the hole．Spanning it，a hand resting on each edge，and with the revolver still in the right hand，he muscled his body down into the hole．While his feet were yet a yard from the bottom he released his hands and dropped down．

At the instant his feet struck bottom he saw the pocket-miner's arm leap out，and his own legs knew a swift，jerking grip that overthrew him．In the nature of the jump his revolver hand was above his head．Swiftly as the grip had flashed about his legs，just as swiftly he brought the revolver down．He was still in the air，his fall in process of completion，when he pulled the trigger．The explosion was deafening in the confined space．The smoke filled the hole so that he could see nothing．He struck the bottom on his back，and like a cat's the pocket-miner's body was on top of him．Even as the miner's body passed on top，the stranger crooked in his right arm to fire；and even in that instant the miner，with a quick thrust of elbow，struck his wrist．The muzzle was thrown up and the bullet thudded into the dirt of the side of the hole．

The next instant the stranger felt the miner's hand grip his wrist．The struggle was now for the revolver．Each man strove to turn it against the other's body．The smoke in the hole was clearing．The stranger，lying on his back，was beginning to see dimly．But suddenly he was blinded by a handful of dirt deliberately flung into his eyes by his antagonist．In that moment of shock his grip on the revolver was broken．In the next moment he felt a smashing darkness descend upon his brain，and in the midst of the darkness even the darkness ceased．

But the pocket-miner fired again and again，until the revolver was empty．Then he tossed it from him and，breathing heavily，sat down on the dead man's legs．

The miner was sobbing and struggling for breath．“Measly skunk！”he panted；“a-campin' on my trail an'lettin' me do the work，an'then shootin' me in the back！”

He was half crying from anger and exhaustion．He peered at the face of the dead man．It was sprinkled with loose dirt and gravel，and it was difficult to distinguish the features．

“Never laid eyes on him before，”the miner concluded his scrutiny．“Just a common an'ordinary thief，hang him！An'he shot me in the back！He shot me in the back！”

He opened his shirt and felt himself，front and back，on his left side．

“Went clean through，and no harm done！”he cried jubilantly．“I'll bet he aimed all right all right；but he drew the gun over when he pulled the trigger—the cuss！But I fixed 'm！Oh，I fixed 'm！”

His fingers were investigating the bullet-hole in his side，and a shade of regret passed over his face．“It's goin' to be stiffer'n hell，”he said．“An'it's up to me to get mended an'get out o'here．”

He crawled out of the hole and went down the hill to his camp．Half an hour later he returned，leading his pack-horse．His open shirt disclosed the rude bandages with which he had dressed his wound．He was slow and awkward with his left-hand movements，but that did not prevent his using the arm．

The bight of the pack-rope under the dead man's shoulders enabled him to heave the body out of the hole．Then he set to work gathering up his gold．He worked steadily for several hours，pausing often to rest his stiffening shoulder and to exclaim：

“He shot me in the back，the measly skunk！He shot me in the back！”

When his treasure was quite cleaned up and wrapped securely into a number of blanket-covered parcels，he made an estimate of its value．

“Four hundred pounds，or I'm a Hottentot，”he concluded．“Say two hundred in quartz an'dirt—that leaves two hundred pounds of gold．Bill！Wake up！Two hundred pounds of gold！Forty thousand dollars！An'it's yourn—all yourn！”

He scratched his head delightedly and his fingers blundered into an unfamiliar groove．They quested along it for several inches．It was a crease through his scalp where the second bullet had ploughed．

He walked angrily over to the dead man．

“You would，would you！”he bullied．“You would，eh？Well，I fixed you good an'plenty，an'I'll give you decent burial，too．That's more'n you'd have done for me．”

He dragged the body to the edge of the hole and toppled it in．It struck the bottom with a dull crash，on its side，the face twisted up to the light．The miner peered down at it．

“An'you shot me in the back！”he said accusingly．

With pick and shovel he filled the hole．Then he loaded the gold on his horse．It was too great a load for the animal，and when he had gained his camp he transferred part of it to his saddle-horse．Even so，he was compelled to abandon a portion of his outfit—pick and shovel and gold-pan，extra food and cooking utensils，and divers odds and ends．

The sun was at the zenith when the man forced the horses at the screen of vines and creepers．To climb the huge boulders the animals were compelled to uprear and struggle blindly through the tangled mass of vegetation．Once the saddle-horse fell heavily and the man removed the pack to get the animal on its feet．After it started on its way again the man thrust his head out from among the leaves and peered up at the hillside．

“The measly skunk！”he said，and disappeared．

There was a ripping and tearing of vines and boughs．The trees surged back and forth，marking the passage of the animals through the midst of them．There was a clashing of steel-shod hoofs on stone，and now and again an oath or a sharp cry of command．Then the voice of the man was raised in song：—

Tu'n around an'tu'n yo'face

Untoe them sweet hills of grace

（D'pow'rs of sin yo'am scornin'！）．

Look about an' look aroun'，

Fling yo'sin-pack on d'groun'

（Yo'will meet wid d'Lord in d'mornin'！）．

The song grew faint and fainter，and through the silence crept back the spirit of the place．The stream once more drowsed and whispered；the hum of the mountain bees rose sleepily．Down through the perfume-weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods．The butterflies drifted in and out among the trees，and over all blazed the quiet sunshine．Only remained the hoof-marks in the meadow and the torn hillside to mark the boisterous trail of the life that had broken the peace of the place and passed on．





A Piece of Steak


With the last morsel of bread Tom King wiped his plate clean of the last particle of flour gravy and chewed the resulting mouthful in a slow and meditative way．When he arose from the table，he was oppressed by the feeling that he was distinctly hungry．Yet he alone had eaten．The two children in the other room had been sent early to bed in order that in sleep they might forget they had gone supperless．His wife had touched nothing，and had sat silently and watched him with solicitous eyes．She was a thin，worn woman of the working-class，though signs of an earlier prettiness were not wanting in her face．The flour for the gravy she had borrowed from the neighbor across the hall．The last two ha'pennies had gone to buy the bread．

He sat down by the window on a rickety chair that protested under his weight，and quite mechanically he put his pipe in his mouth and dipped into the side pocket of his coat．The absence of any tobacco made him aware of his action，and，with a scowl for his forgetfulness，he put the pipe away．His movements were slow，almost hulking，as though he were burdened by the heavy weight of his muscles．He was a solid-bodied，stolid-looking man，and his appearance did not suffer from being overprepossessing．His rough clothes were old and slouchy．The uppers of his shoes were too weak to carry the heavy resoling that was itself of no recent date．And his cotton shirt，a cheap，two-shilling affair，showed a frayed collar and ineradicable paint stains．

But it was Tom King's face that advertised him unmistakably for what he was．It was the face of a typical prize-fighter；of one who had put in long years of service in the squared ring and，by that means，developed and emphasized all the marks of the fighting beast．It was distinctly a lowering countenance，and，that no feature of it might escape notice，it was clean-shaven．The lips were shapeless，and constituted a mouth harsh to excess，that was like a gash in his face．The jaw was aggressive，brutal，heavy．The eyes，slow of movement and heavy-lidded，were almost expressionless under the shaggy，indrawn brows．Sheer animal that he was，the eyes were the most animal-like feature about him．They were sleepy，lion-like—the eyes of a fighting animal．The forehead slanted quickly back to the hair，which，clipped close，showed every bump of a villainous-looking head．A nose，twice broken and moulded variously by countless blows，and a cauliflower ear，permanently swollen and distorted to twice its size，completed his adornment，while the beard，fresh-shaven as it was，sprouted in the skin and gave the face a blue-black stain．

All together，it was the face of a man to be afraid of in a dark alley or lonely place．And yet Tom King was not a criminal，nor had he ever done anything criminal．Outside of brawls，common to his walk in life，he had harmed no one．Nor had he ever been known to pick a quarrel．He was a professional，and all the fighting brutishness of him was reserved for his professional appearances．Outside the ring he was slow-going，easy-natured，and，in his younger days，when money was flush，too open-handed for his own good．He bore no grudges and had few enemies．Fighting was a business with him．In the ring he struck to hurt，struck to maim，struck to destroy；but there was no animus in it．It was a plain business proposition．Audiences assembled and paid for the spectacle of men knocking each other out．The winner took the big end of the purse．When Tom King faced the Woolloomoolloo Gouger，twenty years before，he knew that the Gouger's jaw was only four months healed after having been broken in a Newcastle bout．And he had played for that jaw and broken it again in the ninth round，not because he bore the Gouger any ill-will，but because that was the surest way to put the Gouger out and win the big end of the purse．Nor had the Gouger borne him any ill-will for it．It was the game，and both knew the game and played it．

Tom King had never been a talker，and he sat by the window，morosely silent，staring at his hands．The veins stood out on the backs of the hands，large and swollen；and the knuckles，smashed and battered and malformed，testified to the use to which they had been put．He had never heard that a man's life was the life of his arteries，but well he knew the meaning of those big，upstanding veins．His heart had pumped too much blood through them at top pressure．They no longer did the work．He had stretched the elasticity out of them，and with their distension had passed his endurance．He tired easily now．No longer could he do a fast twenty rounds，hammer and tongs，fight，fight，fight，from gong to gong，with fierce rally on top of fierce rally，beaten to the ropes and in turn beating his opponent to the ropes，and rallying fiercest and fastest of all in that last，twentieth round，with the house on its feet and yelling，himself rushing，striking，ducking，raining showers of blows upon showers of blows and receiving showers of blows in return，and all the time the heart faithfully pumping the surging blood through the adequate veins．The veins，swollen at the time，had always shrunk down again，though not quite—each time，imperceptibly at first，remaining just a trifle larger than before．He stared at them and at his battered knuckles，and，for the moment，caught a vision of the youthful excellence of those hands before the first knuckle had been smashed on the head of Benny Jones，otherwise known as the Welsh Terror．

The impression of his hunger came back on him．

“Blimey，but couldn't I go a piece of steak！”he muttered aloud，clenching his huge fists and spitting out a smothered oath．

“I tried both Burke's an'Sawley's，”his wife said half apolo-getically．

“An'they wouldn't？”he demanded．

“Not a ha'penny．Burke said—”She faltered．

“G'wan！Wot'd he say？”

“As how'e was thinkin' Sandel ud do ye to-night，an'as how yer score was comfortable big as it was．”

Tom King grunted，but did not reply．He was busy thinking of the bull terrier he had kept in his younger days to which he had fed steaks without end．Burke would have given him credit for a thousand steaks—then．But times had changed．Tom King was getting old；and old men，fighting before second-rate clubs，couldn't expect to run bills of any size with the tradesmen．

He had got up in the morning with a longing for a piece of steak，and the longing had not abated．He had not had a fair training for this fight．It was a drought year in Australia，times were hard，and even the most irregular work was difficult to find．He had had no sparring partner，and his food had not been of the best nor always sufficient．He had done a few days' navvy work when he could get it，and he had run around the Domain in the early mornings to get his legs in shape．But it was hard，training without a partner and with a wife and two kiddies that must be fed．Credit with the tradesmen had undergone very slight expansion when he was matched with Sandel．The secretary of the Gayety Club had advanced him three pounds—the loser's end of the purse—and beyond that had refused to go．Now and again he had managed to borrow a few shillings from old pals，who would have lent more only that it was a drought year and they were hard put themselves．No—and there was no use in disguising the fact—his training had not been satisfactory．He should have had better food and no worries．Besides，when a man is forty，it is harder to get into condition than when he is twenty．

“What time is it，Lizzie？”he asked．

His wife went across the hall to inquire，and came back．

“Quarter before eight．”

“They'll be startin' the first bout in a few minutes，”he said．“Only a try-out．Then there's a four-round spar 'tween Dealer Wells an'Gridley，an'a ten-round go 'tween Starlight an'some sailor bloke．I don't come on for over an hour．”

At the end of another silent ten minutes，he rose to his feet．

“Truth is，Lizzie，I ain't had proper trainin'．”

He reached for his hat and started for the door．He did not offer to kiss her—he never did on going out—but on this night she dared to kiss him，throwing her arms around him and compelling him to bend down to her face．She looked quite small against the massive bulk of the man．

“Good luck，Tom，”she said．“You gotter do 'im．”

“Ay，I gotter do 'im，”he repeated．“That's all there is to it．I jus' gotter do 'im．”

He laughed with an attempt at heartiness，while she pressed more closely against him．Across her shoulders he looked around the bare room．It was all he had in the world，with the rent overdue，and her and the kiddies．And he was leaving it to go out into the night to get meat for his mate and cubs—not like a modern working-man going to his machine grind，but in the old，primitive，royal，animal way，by fighting for it．

“I gotter do 'im，”he repeated，this time a hint of desperation in his voice．“If it's a win，it's thirty quid—an'I can pay all that's owin'，with a lump o'money left over．If it's a lose，I get naught—not even a penny for me to ride home on the tram．The secretary's give all that's comin' from a loser's end．Good-by，old woman．I'll come straight home if it's a win．”

“An' I'll be waitin' up，”she called to him along the hall．

It was full two miles to the Gayety，and as he walked along he remembered how in his palmy days—he had once been the heavyweight champion of New South Wales—he would have ridden in a cab to the fight，and how，most likely，some heavy backer would have paid for the cab and ridden with him．There were Tommy Burns and that Yankee nigger，Jack Johnson—they rode about in motor-cars．And he walked！And，as any man knew，a hard two miles was not the best preliminary to a fight．He was an old un，and the world did not wag well with old uns．He was good for nothing now except navvy work，and his broken nose and swollen ear were against him even in that．He found himself wishing that he had learned a trade．It would have been better in the long run．But no one had told him，and he knew，deep down in his heart，that he would not have listened if they had．It had been so easy．Big money—sharp，glorious fights—periods of rest and loafing in between—a following of eager flatterers，the slaps on the back，the shakes of the hand，the toffs glad to buy him a drink for the privilege of five minutes' talk—and the glory of it，the yelling houses，the whirlwind finish，the referee's “King wins！”and his name in the sporting columns next day．

Those had been times！But he realized now，in his slow，ruminating way，that it was the old uns he had been putting away．He was Youth，rising；and they were Age，sinking．No wonder it had been easy—they with their swollen veins and battered knuckles and weary in the bones of them from the long battles they had already fought．He remembered the time he put out old Stowsher Bill，at Rush-Cutters Bay，in the eighteenth round，and how old Bill had cried afterward in the dressing-room like a baby．Perhaps old Bill's rent had been overdue．Perhaps he'd had at home a missus an'a couple of kiddies．And perhaps Bill，that very day of the fight，had had a hungering for a piece of steak．Bill had fought game and taken incredible punishment．He could see now，after he had gone through the mill himself，that Stowsher Bill had fought for a bigger stake，that night twenty years ago，than had young Tom King，who had fought for glory and easy money．No wonder Stowsher Bill had cried afterward in the dressing-room．

Well，a man had only so many fights in him，to begin with．It was the iron law of the game．One man might have a hundred hard fights in him，another man only twenty；each，according to the make of him and the quality of his fibre，had a definite number，and，when he had fought them，he was done．Yes，he had had more fights in him than most of them，and he had had far more than his share of the hard，gruelling fights—the kind that worked the heart and lungs to bursting，that took the elastic out of the arteries and made hard knots of muscle out of Youth's sleek suppleness，that wore out nerve and stamina and made brain and bones weary from excess of effort and endurance overwrought．Yes，he had done better than all of them．There were none of his old fighting partners left．He was the last of the old guard．He had seen them all finished，and he had had a hand in finishing some of them．

They had tried him out against the old uns，and one after another he had put them away—laughing when，like old Stowsher Bill，they cried in the dressing-room．And now he was an old un，and they tried out the youngsters on him．There was that bloke，Sandel．He had come over from New Zealand with a record behind him．But nobody in Australia knew anything about him，so they put him up against old Tom King．If Sandel made a showing，he would be given better men to fight，with bigger purses to win；so it was to be depended upon that he would put up a fierce battle．He had everything to win by it—money and glory and career；and Tom King was the grizzled old chopping-block that guarded the highway to fame and fortune．And he had nothing to win except thirty quid，to pay to the landlord and the tradesmen．And，as Tom King thus ruminated，there came to his stolid vision the form of Youth，glorious Youth，rising exultant and invincible，supple of muscle and silken of skin，with heart and lungs that had never been tired and torn and that laughed at limitation of effort．Yes，Youth was the Nemesis．It destroyed the old uns and recked not that，in so doing，it destroyed itself．It enlarged its arteries and smashed its knuckles，and was in turn destroyed by Youth．For Youth was ever youthful．It was only Age that grew old．

At Castlereagh Street he turned to the left，and three blocks along came to the Gayety．A crowd of young larrikins hanging outside the door made respectful way for him，and he heard one say to another：“That's 'im！That's Tom King！”

Inside，on the way to his dressing-room，he encountered the secretary，a keen-eyed，shrewd-faced young man，who shook his hand．

“How are you feelin'，Tom？”he asked．

“Fit as a fiddle，”King answered，though he knew that he lied，and that if he had a quid，he would give it right there for a good piece of steak．

When he emerged from the dressing-room，his seconds behind him，and came down the aisle to the squared ring in the centre of the hall，a burst of greeting and applause went up from the waiting crowd．He acknowledged salutations right and left，though few of the faces did he know．Most of them were the faces of kiddies unborn when he was winning his first laurels in the squared ring．He leaped lightly to the raised platform and ducked through the ropes to his corner，where he sat down on a folding stool．Jack Ball，the referee，came over and shook his hand．Ball was a broken-down pugilist who for over ten years had not entered the ring as a principal．King was glad that he had him for referee．They were both old uns．If he should rough it with Sandel a bit beyond the rules，he knew Ball could be depended upon to pass it by．

Aspiring young heavyweights，one after another，were climbing into the ring and being presented to the audience by the referee．Also，he issued their challenges for them．

“Young Pronto，”Bill announced，“from North Sydney，challenges the winner for fifty pounds side bet．”

The audience applauded，and applauded again as Sandel himself sprang through the ropes and sat down in his corner．Tom King looked across the ring at him curiously，for in a few minutes they would be locked together in merciless combat，each trying with all the force of him to knock the other into unconsciousness．But little could he see，for Sandel，like himself，had trousers and sweater on over his ring costume．His face was strongly handsome，crowned with a curly mop of yellow hair，while his thick，muscular neck hinted at bodily magnificence．

Young Pronto went to one corner and then the other，shaking hands with the principals and dropping down out of the ring．The challenges went on．Ever Youth climbed through the ropes—Youth unknown，but insatiable—crying out to mankind that with strength and skill it would match issues with the winner．A few years before，in his own heyday of invincibleness，Tom King would have been amused and bored by these preliminaries．But now he sat fascinated，unable to shake the vision of Youth from his eyes．Always were these youngsters rising up in the boxing game，springing through the ropes and shouting their defiance；and always were the old uns going down before them．They climbed to success over the bodies of the old uns．And ever they came，more and more youngsters—Youth unquenchable and irresistible—and ever they put the old uns away，themselves becoming old uns and travelling the same downward path，while behind them，ever pressing on them，was Youth eternal—the new babies，grown lusty and dragging their elders down，with behind them more babies to the end of time—Youth that must have its will and that will never die．

King glanced over to the press box and nodded to Morgan，of the Sportsman，and Corbett，of the Referee．Then he held out his hands，while Sid Sullivan and Charley Bates，his seconds，slipped on his gloves and laced them tight，closely watched by one of Sandel's seconds，who first examined critically the tapes on King's knuckles．A second of his own was in Sandel's corner，performing a like office．Sandel's trousers were pulled off，and，as he stood up，his sweater was skinned off over his head．And Tom King，looking，saw Youth incarnate，deep-chested，heavy-thewed，with muscles that slipped and slid like live things under the white satin skin．The whole body was acrawl with life，and Tom King knew that it was a life that had never oozed its freshness out through the aching pores during the long fights wherein Youth paid its toll and departed not quite so young as when it entered．

The two men advanced to meet each other，and，as the gong sounded and the seconds clattered out of the ring with the folding stools，they shook hands and instantly took their fighting attitudes．And instantly，like a mechanism of steel and springs balanced on a hair trigger，Sandel was in and out and in again，landing a left to the eyes，a right to the ribs，ducking a counter，dancing lightly away and dancing menacingly back again．He was swift and clever．It was a dazzling exhibition．The house yelled its approbation．But King was not dazzled．He had fought too many fights and too many youngsters．He knew the blows for what they were—too quick and too deft to be dangerous．Evidently Sandel was going to rush things from the start．It was to be expected．It was the way of Youth，expending its splendor and excellence in wild insurgence and furious onslaught，over-whelming opposition with its own unlimited glory of strength and desire．

Sandel was in and out，here，there，and everywhere，light-footed and eager-hearted，a living wonder of white flesh and stinging muscle that wove itself into a dazzling fabric of attack，slipping and leaping like a flying shuttle from action to action through a thousand actions，all of them centred upon the destruction of Tom King，who stood between him and fortune．And Tom King patiently endured．He knew his business，and he knew Youth now that Youth was no longer his．There was nothing to do till the other lost some of his steam，was his thought，and he grinned to himself as he deliberately ducked so as to receive a heavy blow on the top of his head．It was a wicked thing to do，yet eminently fair according to the rules of the boxing game．A man was supposed to take care of his own knuckles，and，if he insisted on hitting an opponent on the top of the head，he did so at his own peril．King could have ducked lower and let the blow whiz harmlessly past，but he remembered his own early fights and how he smashed his first knuckle on the head of the Welsh Terror．He was but playing the game．That duck had accounted for one of Sandel's knuckles．Not that Sandel would mind it now．He would go on，superbly regardless，hitting as hard as ever throughout the fight．But later on，when the long ring battles had begun to tell，he would regret that knuckle and look back and remember how he smashed it on Tom King's head．

The first round was all Sandel's，and he had the house yelling with the rapidity of his whirlwind rushes．He overwhelmed King with avalanches of punches，and King did nothing．He never struck once，contenting himself with covering up，blocking and ducking and clinching to avoid punishment．He occasionally feinted，shook his head when the weight of a punch landed，and moved stolidly about，never leaping or springing or wasting an ounce of strength．Sandel must foam the froth of Youth away before discreet Age could dare to retaliate．All King's movements were slow and methodical，and his heavy-lidded，slow-moving eyes gave him the appearance of being half asleep or dazed．Yet they were eyes that saw everything，that had been trained to see everything through all his twenty years and odd in the ring．They were eyes that did not blink or waver before an impending blow，but that coolly saw and measured distance．

Seated in his corner for the minute's rest at the end of the round，he lay back with outstretched legs，his arms resting on the right angle of the ropes，his chest and abdomen heaving frankly and deeply as he gulped down the air driven by the towels of his seconds．He listened with closed eyes to the voices of the house，“Why don't yeh fight，Tom？”many were crying．“Yeh ain't afraid of 'im，are yeh？”

“Muscle-bound，”he heard a man on a front seat comment．“He can't move quicker．Two to one on Sandel，in quids．”

The gong struck and the two men advanced from their corners．Sandel came forward fully three-quarters of the distance，eager to begin again；but King was content to advance the shorter distance．It was in line with his policy of economy．He had not been well trained，and he had not had enough to eat，and every step counted．Besides，he had already walked two miles to the ringside．It was a repetition of the first round，with Sandel attacking like a whirlwind and with the audience indignantly demanding why King did not fight．Beyond feinting and several slowly delivered and ineffectual blows he did nothing save block and stall and clinch．Sandel wanted to make the pace fast，while King，out of his wisdom，refused to accommodate him．He grinned with a certain wistful pathos in his ring-battered countenance，and went on cherishing his strength with the jealousy of which only Age is capable．Sandel was Youth，and he threw his strength away with the munificent abandon of Youth．To King belonged the ring generalship，the wisdom bred of long，aching fights．He watched with cool eyes and head，moving slowly and waiting for Sandel's froth to foam away．To the majority of the onlookers it seemed as though King was hopelessly outclassed，and they voiced their opinion in offers of three to one on Sandel．But there were wise ones，a few，who knew King of old time，and who covered what they considered easy money．

The third round began as usual，one-sided，with Sandel doing all the leading and delivering all the punishment．A half-minute had passed when Sandel，overconfident，left an opening．King's eyes and right arm flashed in the same instant．It was his first real blow—a hook，with the twisted arch of the arm to make it rigid，and with all the weight of the half-pivoted body behind it．It was like a sleepy-seeming lion suddenly thrusting out a lightning paw．Sandel，caught on the side of the jaw，was felled like a bullock．The audience gasped and murmured awe-stricken applause．The man was not muscle-bound，after all，and he could drive a blow like a trip-hammer．

Sandel was shaken．He rolled over and attempted to rise，but the sharp yells from his seconds to take the count restrained him．He knelt on one knee，ready to rise，and waited，while the referee stood over him，counting the seconds loudly in his ear．At the ninth he rose in fighting attitude，and Tom King，facing him，knew regret that the blow had not been an inch nearer the point of the jaw．That would have been a knock out，and he could have carried the thirty quid home to the missus and the kiddies．

The round continued to the end of its three minutes，Sandel for the first time respectful of his opponent and King slow of movement and sleepy-eyed as ever．As the round neared its close，King，warned of the fact by sight of the seconds crouching outside ready for the spring in through the ropes，worked the fight around to his own corner．And when the gong struck，he sat down immediately on the waiting stool，while Sandel had to walk all the way across the diagonal of the square to his own corner．It was a little thing，but it was the sum of little things that counted．Sandel was compelled to walk that many more steps，to give up that much energy，and to lose a part of the precious minute of rest．At the beginning of every round King loafed slowly out from his corner，forcing his opponent to advance the greater distance．The end of every round found the fight manoeuvred by King into his own corner so that he could immediately sit down．

Two more rounds went by，in which King was parsimonious of effort and Sandel prodigal．The latter's attempt to force a fast pace made King uncomfortable，for a fair percentage of the multitudinous blows showered upon him went home．Yet King persisted in his dogged slowness，despite the crying of the young hotheads for him to go in and fight．Again，in the sixth round，Sandel was careless，again Tom King's fearful right flashed out to the jaw，and again Sandel took the nine seconds count．

By the seventh round Sandel's pink of condition was gone，and he settled down to what he knew was to be the hardest fight in his experience．Tom King was an old un，but a better old un than he had ever encountered—an old un who never lost his head，who was remarkably able at defence，whose blows had the impact of a knotted club，and who had a knockout in either hand．Nevertheless，Tom King dared not hit often．He never forgot his battered knuckles，and knew that every hit must count if the knuckles were to last out the fight．As he sat in his corner，glancing across at his opponent，the thought came to him that the sum of his wisdom and Sandel's youth would constitute a world's champion heavyweight．But that was the trouble．Sandel would never become a world champion．He lacked the wisdom，and the only way for him to get it was to buy it with Youth；and when wisdom was his，Youth would have been spent in buying it．

King took every advantage he knew．He never missed an opportunity to clinch，and in effecting most of the clinches his shoulder drove stiffly into the other's ribs．In the philosophy of the ring a shoulder was as good as a punch so far as damage was concerned，and a great deal better so far as concerned expenditure of effort．Also，in the clinches King rested his weight on his opponent，and was loath to let go．This compelled the interference of the referee，who tore them apart，always assisted by Sandel，who had not yet learned to rest．He could not refrain from using those glorious flying arms and writhing muscles of his，and when the other rushed into a clinch，striking shoulder against ribs，and with head resting under Sandel's left arm，Sandel almost invariably swung his right behind his own back and into the projecting face．It was a clever stroke，much admired by the audience，but it was not dangerous，and was，therefore，just that much wasted strength．But Sandel was tireless and unaware of limitations，and King grinned and doggedly endured．

Sandel developed a fierce right to the body，which made it appear that King was taking an enormous amount of punishment，and it was only the old ringsters who appreciated the deft touch of King's left glove to the other's biceps just before the impact of the blow．It was true，the blow landed each time；but each time it was robbed of its power by that touch on the biceps．In the ninth round，three times inside a minute，King's right hooked its twisted arch to the jaw；and three times Sandel's body，heavy as it was，was levelled to the mat．Each time he took the nine seconds allowed him and rose to his feet，shaken and jarred，but still strong．He had lost much of his speed，and he wasted less effort．He was fighting grimly；but he continued to draw upon his chief asset，which was Youth．King's chief asset was experience．As his vitality had dimmed and his vigor abated，he had replaced them with cunning，with wisdom born of the long fights and with a careful shepherding of strength．Not alone had he learned never to make a superfluous movement，but he had learned how to seduce an opponent into throwing his strength away．Again and again，by feint of foot and hand and body he continued to inveigle Sandel into leaping back，ducking，or countering．King rested，but he never permitted Sandel to rest．It was the strategy of Age．

Early in the tenth round King began stopping the other's rushes with straight lefts to the face，and Sandel，grown wary，responded by drawing the left，then by ducking it and delivering his right in a swinging hook to the side of the head．It was too high up to be vitally effective；but when first it landed，King knew the old，familiar descent of the black veil of unconsciousness across his mind．For the instant，or for the slighest fraction of an instant，rather，he ceased．In the one moment he saw his opponent ducking out of his field of vision and the background of white，watching faces；in the next moment he again saw his opponent and the background of faces．It was as if he had slept for a time and just opened his eyes again，and yet the interval of unconsciousness was so microscopically short that there had been no time for him to fall．The audience saw him totter and his knees give，and then saw him recover and tuck his chin deeper into the shelter of his left shoulder．

Several times Sandel repeated the blow，keeping King partially dazed，and then the latter worked out his defence，which was also a counter．Feinting with his left he took a half-step backward，at the same time upper cutting with the whole strength of his right．So accurately was it timed that it landed squarely on Sandel's face in the full，downward sweep of the duck，and Sandel lifted in the air and curled backward，striking the mat on his head and shoulders．Twice King achieved this，then turned loose and hammered his opponent to the ropes．He gave Sandel no chance to rest or to set himself，but smashed blow in upon blow till the house rose to its feet and the air was filled with an unbroken roar of applause．But Sandel's strength and endurance were superb，and he continued to stay on his feet．A knockout seemed certain，and a captain of police，appalled at the dreadful punishment，arose by the ringside to stop the fight．The gong struck for the end of the round and Sandel staggered to his corner，protesting to the captain that he was sound and strong．To prove it，he threw two backair-springs，and the police captain gave in．

Tom King，leaning back in his corner and breathing hard，was disappointed．If the fight had been stopped，the referee，perforce，would have rendered him the decision and the purse would have been his．Unlike Sandel，he was not fighting for glory or career，but for thirty quid．And now Sandel would recuperate in the minute of rest．

Youth will be served—this saying flashed into King's mind，and he remembered the first time he had heard it，the night when he had put away Stowsher Bill．The toff who had bought him a drink after the fight and patted him on the shoulder had used those words．Youth will be served！The toff was right．And on that night in the long ago he had been Youth．To-night Youth sat in the opposite corner．As for himself，he had been fighting for half an hour now，and he was an old man．Had he fought like Sandel，he would not have lasted fifteen minutes．But the point was that he did not recuperate．Those upstanding arteries and that sorely tried heart would not enable him to gather strength in the intervals between the rounds．And he had not had sufficient strength in him to begin with．His legs were heavy under him and beginning to cramp．He should not have walked those two miles to the fight．And there was the steak which he had got up longing for that morning．A great and terrible hatred rose up in him for the butchers who had refused him credit．It was hard for an old man to go into a fight without enough to eat．And a piece of steak was such a little thing，a few pennies at best；yet it meant thirty quid to him．

With the gong that opened the eleventh round，Sandel rushed，making a show of freshness which he did not really possess．King knew it for what it was—a bluff as old as the game itself．He clinched to save himself，then，going free，allowed Sandel to get set．This was what King desired．He feinted with his left，drew the answering duck and swinging upward hook，then made the half-step backward，delivered the upper cut full to the face and crumpled Sandel over to the mat．After that he never let him rest，receiving punishment himself，but inflicting far more，smashing Sandel to the ropes，hooking and driving all manner of blows into him，tearing away from his clinches or punching him out of attempted clinches，and ever when Sandel would have fallen，catching him with one uplifting hand and with the other immediately smashing him into the ropes where he could not fall．

The house by this time had gone mad，and it was his house，nearly every voice yelling：“Go it，Tom！”“Get 'im！Get 'im！”“You've got 'im，Tom！You've got 'im！”It was to be a whirlwind finish，and that was what a ringside audience paid to see．

And Tom King，who for half an hour had conserved his strength，now expended it prodigally in the one great effort he knew he had in him．It was his one chance—now or not at all．His strength was waning fast，and his hope was that before the last of it ebbed out of him he would have beaten his opponent down for the count．And as he continued to strike and force，coolly estimating the weight of his blows and the quality of the damage wrought，he realized how hard a man Sandel was to knock out．Stamina and endurance were his to an extreme degree，and they were the virgin stamina and endurance of Youth．Sandel was certainly a coming man．He had it in him．Only out of such rugged fibre were successful fighters fashioned．

Sandel was reeling and staggering，but Tom King's legs were cramping and his knuckles going back on him．Yet he steeled himself to strike the fierce blows，every one of which brought anguish to his tortured hands．Though now he was receiving practically no punishment，he was weakening as rapidly as the other．His blows went home，but there was no longer the weight behind them，and each blow was the result of a severe effort of will．His legs were like lead，and they dragged visibly under him；while Sandel's backers，cheered by this symptom，began calling encouragement to their man．

King was spurred to a burst of effort．He delivered two blows in succession—a left，a trifle too high，to the solar plexus，and a right cross to the jaw．They were not heavy blows，yet so weak and dazed was Sandel that he went down and lay quivering．The referee stood over him，shouting the count of the fatal seconds in his ear．If before the tenth second was called，he did not rise，the fight was lost．The house stood in hushed silence．King rested on trembling legs．A mortal dizziness was upon him，and before his eyes the sea of faces sagged and swayed，while to his ears，as from a remote distance，came the count of the referee．Yet he looked upon the fight as his．It was impossible that a man so punished could rise．

Only Youth could rise，and Sandel rose．At the fourth second he rolled over on his face and groped blindly for the ropes．By the seventh second he had dragged himself to his knee，where he rested，his head rolling groggily on his shoulders．As the referee cried “Nine！”Sandel stood upright，in proper stalling position，his left arm wrapped about his face，his right wrapped about his stomach．Thus were his vital points guarded，while he lurched forward toward King in the hope of effecting a clinch and gaining more time．

At the instant Sandel arose，King was at him，but the two blows he delivered were muffled on the stalled arms．The next moment Sandel was in the clinch and holding on desperately while the referee strove to drag the two men apart．King helped to force himself free．He knew the rapidity with which Youth recovered，and he knew that Sandel was his if he could prevent that recovery．One stiff punch would do it．Sandel was his，indubitably his．He had out-generalled him，outfought him，out-pointed him．Sandel reeled out of the clinch，balanced on the hair line between defeat or survival．One good blow would topple him over and down and out．And Tom King，in a flash of bitterness，remembered the piece of steak and wished that he had it then behind that necessary punch he must deliver．He nerved himself for the blow，but it was not heavy enough nor swift enough．Sandel swayed，but did not fall，staggering back to the ropes and holding on．King staggered after him，and，with a pang like that of dissolution，delivered another blow．But his body had deserted him．All that was left of him was a fighting intelligence that was dimmed and clouded from exhaustion．The blow that was aimed for the jaw struck no higher than the shoulder．He had willed the blow higher，but the tired muscles had not been able to obey．And，from the impact of the blow，Tom King himself reeled back and nearly fell．Once again he strove．This time his punch missed altogether，and，from absolute weakness，he fell against Sandel and clinched，holding on to him to save himself from sinking to the floor．

King did not attempt to free himself．He had shot his bolt．He was gone．And Youth had been served．Even in the clinch he could feel Sandel growing stronger against him．When the referee thrust them apart，there，before his eyes，he saw Youth recuperate．From instant to instant Sandel grew stronger．His punches，weak and futile at first，became stiff and accurate．Tom King's bleared eyes saw the gloved fist driving at his jaw，and he willed to guard it by interposing his arm．He saw the danger，willed the act；but the arm was too heavy．It seemed burdened with a hundredweight of lead．It would not lift itself，and he strove to lift it with his soul．Then the gloved fist landed home．He experienced a sharp snap that was like an electric spark，and，simultaneously，the veil of blackness enveloped him．

When he opened his eyes again he was in his corner，and he heard the yelling of the audience like the roar of the surf at Bondi Beach．A wet sponge was being pressed against the base of his brain，and Sid Sullivan was blowing cold water in a refreshing spray over his face and chest．His gloves had already been removed，and Sandel，bending over him，was shaking his hand．He bore no ill-will toward the man who had put him out，and he returned the grip with a heartiness that made his battered knuckles protest．Then Sandel stepped to the centre of the ring and the audience hushed its pandemonium to hear him accept young Pronto's challenge and offer to increase the side bet to one hundred pounds．King looked on apathetically while his seconds mopped the streaming water from him，dried his face，and prepared him to leave the ring．He felt hungry．It was not the ordinary，gnawing kind，but a great faintness，a palpitation at the pit of the stomach that communicated itself to all his body．He remembered back into the fight to the moment when he had Sandel swaying and tottering on the hair-line balance of defeat．Ah，that piece of steak would have done it！He had lacked just that for the decisive blow，and he had lost．It was all because of the piece of steak．

His seconds were half-supporting him as they helped him through the ropes．He tore free from them，ducked through the ropes unaided，and leaped heavily to the floor，following on their heels as they forced a passage for him down the crowded centre aisle．Leaving the dressing-room for the street，in the entrance to the hall，some young fellow spoke to him．

“W'y didn't yuh go in an' get 'im when yuh 'ad 'im？”the young fellow asked．

“Aw，go to hell！”said Tom King，and passed down the steps to the sidewalk．

The doors of the public house at the corner were swinging wide，and he saw the lights and the smiling barmaids，heard the many voices discussing the fight and the prosperous chink of money on the bar．Somebody called to him to have a drink．He hesitated perceptibly，then refused and went on his way．

He had not a copper in his pocket，and the two-mile walk home seemed very long．He was certainly getting old．Crossing the Domain，he sat down suddenly on a bench，unnerved by the thought of the missus sitting up for him，waiting to learn the outcome of the fight．That was harder than any knockout，and it seemed almost impossible to face．

He felt weak and sore，and the pain of his smashed knuckles warned him that，even if he could find a job at navvy work，it would be a week before he could grip a pick handle or a shovel．The hunger palpitation at the pit of the stomach was sickening．His wretchedness overwhelmed him，and into his eyes came an unwonted moisture．He covered his face with his hands，and，as he cried，he remembered Stowsher Bill and how he had served him that night in the long ago．Poor old Stowsher Bill！He could understand now why Bill had cried in the dressing-room．





The Mexican


I


Nobody knew his history—they of the Junta least of all．He was their “little mystery，”their “big patriot，”and in his way he worked as hard for the coming Mexican Revolution as did they．They were tardy in recognizing this，for not one of the Junta liked him．The day he first drifted into their crowded，busy rooms，they all suspected him of being a spy—one of the bought tools of the Diaz secret service．Too many of the comrades were in civil an military prisons scattered over the United States，and others of them，in irons，were even then being taken across the border to be lined up against adobe walls and shot．

At the first sight the boy did not impress them favorably．Boy he was，not more than eighteen and not over large for his years．He announced that he was Felipe Rivera，and that it was his wish to work for the Revolution．That was all—not a wasted word，no further explanation．He stood waiting．There was no smile on his lips，no geniality in his eyes．Big dashing Paulino Vera felt an inward shudder．Here was something forbidding，terrible，inscrutable．There was something venomous and snake-like in the boy's black eyes．They burned like cold fire，as with a vast，concentrated bitterness．He flashed them from the faces of the conspirators to the typewriter which little Mrs．Sethby was industriously operating．His eyes rested on hers but an instant—she had chanced to look up—and she，too，sensed the nameless something that made her pause．She was compelled to read back in order to regain the swing of the letter she was writing．

Paulino Vera looked questioningly at Arrellano and Ramos，and questioningly they looked back and to each other．The indecision of doubt brooded in their eyes．This slender boy was the Unknown，vested with all the menace of the Unknown．He was unrecognizable，something quite beyond the ken of honest，ordinary revolutionists whose fiercest hatred for Diaz and his tyranny after all was only that of honest and ordinary patriots．Here was something else，they knew not what．But Vera，always the most impulsive，the quickest to act，stepped into the breach．

“Very well，”he said coldly．“You say you want to work for the Revolution．Take off your coat．Hang it over there．I will show you—come—where are the buckets and cloths．The floor is dirty．You will begin by scrubbing it，and by scrubbing the floors of the other rooms．The spittoons need to be cleaned．Then there are the windows．”

“Is it for the Revolution？”the boy asked．

“It is for the Revolution，”Vera answered．

Rivera looked cold suspicion at all of them，then proceeded to take off his coat．

“It is well，”he said．

And nothing more．Day after day he came to his work—sweeping，scrubbing，cleaning．He emptied the ashes from the stoves，brought up the coal and kindling，and lighted the fires before the most energetic one of them was at his desk．

“Can I sleep here？”he asked once．

Ah，ha！So that was it—the hand of Diaz showing through！To sleep in the rooms of the Junta meant access to their secrets，to the lists of names，to the addresses of comrades down on Mexican soil．The request was denied，and Rivera never spoke of it again．He slept they knew not where，and ate they knew not where nor how．Once，Arrellano offered him a couple of dollars．Rivera declined the money with a shake of the head．When Vera joined in and tried to press it upon him，he said：

“I am working for the Revolution．”

It takes money to raise a modern revolution，and always the Junta was pressed．The members starved and toiled，and the longest day was none too long，and yet there were times when it appeared as if the Revolution stood or fell on no more than the matter of a few dollars．Once，the first time，when the rent of the house was two months behind and the landlord was threatening dispossession，it was Felipe Rivera，the scrub-boy in the poor，cheap clothes，worn and threadbare，who laid sixty dollars in gold on May Sethby's desk．There were other times．Three hundred letters，clicked out on the busy typewriters （appeals for assistance，for sanctions from the organized labor groups，requests for square news deals to the editors of newspapers，protests against the high-handed treatment of revolutionists by the United States courts），lay unmailed，awaiting postage．Vera's watch had disappeared—the old-fashioned gold repeater that had been his father's．Likewise had gone the plain gold band from May Setbby's third finger．Things were desperate．Ramos and Arrellano pulled their long mustaches in despair．The letters must go off，and the Post Office allowed no credit to purchasers of stamps．Then it was that Rivera put on his hat and went out．When he came back he laid a thousand two-cent stamps on May Sethby's desk．

“I wonder if it is the cursed gold of Diaz？”said Vera to the comrades．

They elevated their brows and could not decide．And Felipe Rivera，the scrubber for the Revolution，continued，as occasion arose，to lay down gold and silver for the Junta's use．

And still they could not bring themselves to like him．They did not know him．His ways were not theirs．He gave no confidences．He repelled all probing．Youth that he was，they could never nerve themselves to dare to question him．

“A great and lonely spirit，perhaps，I do not know，I do not know，”Arrellano said helplessly．

“He is not human，”said Ramos．

“His soul has been seared，”said May Sethby．“Light and laughter have been burned out of him．He is like one dead，and yet he is fearfully alive．”

“He has been through hell，”said Vera．“No man could look like that who has not been through hell—and he is only a boy．”

Yet they could not like him．He never talked，never inquired，never suggested．He would stand listening，expressionless，a thing dead，save for his eyes，coldly burning，while their talk of the Revolution ran high and warm．From face to face and speaker to speaker his eyes would turn，boring like gimlets of incandescent ice，disconcerting and perturbing．

“He is no spy，”Vera confided to May Sethby．“He is a patriot—mark me，the greatest patriot of us all．I know it，I feel it，here in my heart and head I feel it．But him I know not at all．”

“He has a bad temper，”said May Sethby．

“I know，”said Vera，with a shudder．“He has looked at me with those eyes of his．They do not love；they threaten；they are savage as a wild tiger's．I know，if I should prove unfaithful to the Cause，that he would kill me．He has no heart．He is pitiless as steel，keen and cold as frost．He is like moonshine in a winter night when a man freezes to death on some lonely mountain top．I am not afraid of Diaz and all his killers；but this boy，of him am I afraid．I tell you true．I am afraid．He is the breath of death．”

Yet Vera it was who persuaded the others to give the first trust to Rivera．The line of communication between Los Angeles and Lower California had broken down．Three of the comrades had dug their own graves and been shot into them．Two more were United States prisoners in Los Angeles．Juan Alvarado，the Federal commander，was a monster．All their plans did he checkmate．They could no longer gain access to the active revolutionists，and the incipient ones，in Lower California．

Young Rivera was given his instructions and dispatched south．When he returned，the line of communication was reëstablished，and Juan Alvarado was dead．He had been found in bed，a knife hilt-deep in his breast．This had exceeded Rivera's instructions，but they of the Junta knew the times of his movements．They did not ask him．He said nothing．But they looked at one another and conjectured．

“I have told you，”said Vera．“Diaz has more to fear from this youth than from any man．He is implacable．He is the hand of God．”

The bad temper，mentioned by May Sethby，and sensed by them all，was evidenced by physical proofs．Now he appeared with a cut lip，a blackened cheek，or a swollen ear．It was patent that he brawled，somewhere in that outside world where he ate and slept，gained money，and moved in ways unknown to them．As the time passed，he had come to set type for the little revolutionary sheet they published weekly．There were occasions when he was unable to set type，when his knuckles were bruised and battered，when his thumbs were injured and helpless，when one arm or the other hung wearily at his side while his face was drawn with unspoken pain．

“A wastrel，”said Arrellano．

“A frequenter of low places，”said Ramos．

“But where does he get the money？”Vera demanded．“Only to-day，just now，have I learned that he paid the bill for white paper—one hundred and forty dollars．”

“There are his absences，”said May Sethby．“He never explains them．”

“We should set a spy upon him，”Ramos propounded．

“I should not care to be that spy，”said Vera．“I fear you would never see me again，save to bury me．He has a terrible passion．Not even God would he permit to stand between him and the way of his passion．”

“I feel like a child before him，”Ramos confessed．

“To me he is power—he is the primitive，the wild wolf，—the striking rattlesnake，the stinging centipede，”said Arrellano．

“He is the Revolution incarnate，”said Vera．“He is the flame and the spirit of it，the insatiable cry for vengeance that makes no cry but that slays noiselessly．He is a destroying angel moving through the still watches of the night．”

“I could weep over him，”said May Sethby．“He knows nobody．He hates all people．Us he tolerates，for we are the way of his desire．He is alone．．．lonely．”Her voice broke in a half sob and there was dimness in her eyes．

Rivera's ways and times were truly mysterious．There were periods when they did not see him for a week at a time．Once，he was away a month．These occasions were always capped by his return，when，without advertisement or speech，he laid gold coins on May Sethby's desk．Again，for days and weeks，he spent all his time with the Junta．And yet again，for irregular periods，he would disappear through the heart of each day，from early morning until late afternoon．At such times he came early and remained late．Arrellano had found him at midnight，setting type with fresh swollen knuckles，or mayhap it was his lip，new-split，that still bled．





II


The time of the crisis approached．Whether or not the Revolution would be depended upon the Junta，and the Junta was hard-pressed．The need for money was greater than ever before，while money was harder to get．Patriots had given their last cent and now could give no more．Section gang laborers—fugitive peons from Mexico—were contributing half their scanty wages．But more than that was needed．The heart-breaking，conspiring，undermining toil of years approached fruition．The time was ripe．The Revolution hung on the balance．One shove more，one last heroic effort，and it would tremble across the scales to victory．They knew their Mexico．Once started，the Revolution would take care of itself．The whole Diaz machine would go down like a house of cards．The border was ready to rise．One Yankee，with a hundred I．W．W．men，waited the word to cross over the border and begin the conquest of Lower California．But he needed guns．And clear across to the Atlantic，the Junta in touch with them all and all of them needing guns，mere adventurers，soldiers of fortune，bandits，disgruntled American union men，socialists，anarchists，rough-necks，Mexican exiles，peons escaped from bondage，whipped miners from the bull-pens of Coeur d'Alene and Colorado who desired only the more vindictively to fight—all the flotsam and jetsam of wild spirits from the madly complicated modern world．And it was guns and ammunition，ammunition and guns—the unceasing and eternal cry．

Fling this heterogeneous，bankrupt，vindictive mass across the border，and the Revolution was on．The custom house，the northern ports of entry，would be captured．Diaz could not resist．He dared not throw the weight of his armies against them，for he must hold the south．And through the south the flame would spread despite．The people would rise．The defenses of city after city would crumple up．State after state would totter down．And at last，from every side，the victorious armies of the Revolution would close in on the City of Mexico itself，Diaz's last stronghold．

But the money．They had the men，impatient and urgent，who would use the guns．They knew the traders who would sell and deliver the guns．But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta．The last dollar had been spent，the last resource and the last starving patriot milked dry，and the great adventure still trembled on the scales．Guns and ammunition！The ragged battalions must be armed．But how？Ramos lamented his confiscated estates．Arrellano wailed the spendthriftness of his youth．May Sethby wondered if it would have been different had they of the Junta been more economical in the past．

“To think that the freedom of Mexico should stand or fall on a few paltry thousands of dollars，”said Paulino Vera．

Despair was in all their faces．Jose Amarillo，their last hope，a recent convert，who had promised money，had been apprehended at his hacienda in Chihuahua and shot against his own stable wall．The news had just come through．

Rivera，on his knees，scrubbing，looked up，with suspended brush，his bare arms flecked with soapy，dirty water．

“Will five thousand do it？”he asked．

They looked their amazement．Vera nodded and swallowed．He could not speak，but he was on the instant invested with a vast faith．

“Order the guns，”Rivera said，and thereupon was guilty of the longest flow of words they had ever heard him utter．“The time is short．In three weeks I shall bring you the five thousand．It is well．The weather will be warmer for those who fight．Also，it is the best I can do．”

Vera fought his faith．It was incredible．Too many fond hopes had been shattered since he had begun to play the revolution game．He believed this threadbare scrubber of the Revolution，and yet he dared not believe．

“You are crazy，”he said．

“In three weeks，”said Rivera．“Order the guns．”

He got up，rolled down his sleeves，and put on his coat．

“Order the guns，”he said．“I am going now．”





III


After hurrying and scurrying，much telephoning and bad language，a night session was held in Kelly's office．Kelly was rushed with business；also，he was unlucky．He had brought Danny Ward out from New York，arranged the fight for him with Billy Carthey，the date was three weeks away，and for two days now，carefully concealed from the sporting writers，Carthey had been lying up，badly injured．There was no one to take his place．Kelly had been burning the wires East to every eligible lightweight，but they were tied up with dates and contracts．And now hope had revived，though faintly．

“You've got a hell of a nerve，”Kelly addressed Rivera，after one look，as soon as they got together．

Hate that was malignant was in Rivera's eyes，but his face remained impassive．

“I can lick Ward，”was all he said．

“How do you know？Ever see him fight？”

Rivera shook his head．

“He can beat you up with one hand and both eyes closed．”

Rivera shrugged his shoulders．

“Haven't you got anything to say？”the fight promoter snarled．

“I can lick him．”

“Who'd you ever fight，anyway！”Michael Kelly demanded．Michael was the promoter's brother，and ran the Yellowstone pool rooms where he made goodly sums on the fight game．

Rivera favored him with a bitter，unanswering stare．

The promoter's secretary，a distinctively sporty young man，sneered audibly．

“Well，you know Roberts，”Kelly broke the hostile silence．“He ought to be here．I've sent for him．Sit down and wait，though from the looks of you，you haven't got a chance．I can't throw the public down with a bum fight．Ringside seats are selling at fifteen dollars，you know that．”

When Roberts arrived，it was patent that he was mildly drunk．He was a tall，lean，slack-jointed individual，and his walk，like his talk，was a smooth and languid drawl．

Kelly went straight to the point．

“Look here，Roberts，you've been braggin' you discovered this little Mexican．You know Carthey's broke his arm．Well，this little yellow streak has the gall to blow in to-day and say he'll take Carthey's place．What about it？”

“It's all right，Kelly，”came the slow response．“He can put up a fight．”

“I suppose you'll be sayin' next that he can lick Ward，”Kelly snapped．

Roberts considered judicially．

“No，I won't say that．Ward's a top-notcher and a ring general．But he can't hashhouse Rivera in short order．I know Rivera．Nobody can get his goat．He ain't got a goat that I could ever discover．And he's a two-handed fighter．He can throw in the sleep-makers from any position．”

“Never mind that．What kind of a show can he put up？You've been conditioning and training fighters all your life．I take off my hat to your judgment．Can he give the public a run for its money？”

“He sure can，and he'll worry Ward a mighty heap on top of it．You don't know that boy．I do．I discovered him．He ain't got a goat．He's a devil．He's a wizzy-wooz if anybody should ask you．He'll make Ward sit up with a show of local talent that'll make the rest of you sit up．I won't say he'll lick Ward，but he'll put up such a show that you'll all know he's a comer．”

“All right．”Kelly turned to his secretary．“Ring up Ward．I warned him to show up if I thought it worth while．He's right across at the Yellowstone，throwin' chests and doing the popular．”Kelly turned back to the conditioner．“Have a drink？”

Roberts sipped his highball and unburdened himself．

“Never told you how I discovered the little cuss．It was a couple of years ago he showed up out at the quarters．I was getting Prayne ready for his fight with Delaney．Prayne's wicked．He ain't got a tickle of mercy in his make-up．He'd chopped up his pardner's something cruel，and I couldn't find a willing boy that'd work with him．I'd noticed this little starved Mexican kid hanging around，and I was desperate．So I grabbed him，slammed on the gloves，and put him in．He was tougher 'n rawhide，but weak．And he didn't know the first letter in the alphabet of boxing．Prayne chopped him to ribbons．But he hung on for two sickening rounds，when he fainted．Starvation，that was all．Battered？You couldn't have recognized him．I gave him half a dollar and a square meal．You oughta seen him wolf it down．He hadn't had a bite for a couple of days．That's the end of him，thinks I．But next day he showed up，stiff an'sore，ready for another half and a square meal．And he done better as time went by．Just a born fighter，and tough beyond belief．He hasn't a heart．He's a piece of ice．And he never talked eleven words in a string since I know him．He saws wood and does his work．”

“I've seen 'm，”the secretary said．“He's worked a lot for you．”

“All the big little fellows has tried out on him，”Roberts answered．“And he's learned from 'em．I've seen some of them he could lick．But his heart wasn't in it．I reckoned he never liked the game．He seemed to act that way．”

“He's been fighting some before the little clubs the last few months，”Kelly said．

“Sure．But I don't know what struck 'm．All of a sudden his heart got into it．He just went out like a streak and cleaned up all the little local fellows．Seemed to want the money，and he's won a bit，though his clothes don't look it．He's peculiar．Nobody knows his business．Nobody knows how he spends his time．Even when he's on the job，he plumb up and disappears most of each day soon as his work is done．Sometimes he just blows away for weeks at a time．But he don't take advice．There's a fortune in it for the fellow that gets the job of managin' him，only he won't consider it．And you watch him hold out for the cash money when you get down to terms．”

It was at this stage that Danny Ward arrived．Quite a party it was．His manager and trainer were with him，and he breezed in like a gusty draught of geniality，good-nature，and all-conqueringness．Greetings flew about，a joke here，a retort there，a smile or a laugh for everybody．Yet it was his way，and only partly sincere．He was a good actor，and he had found geniality a most valuable asset in the game of getting on in the world．But down underneath he was the deliberate，cold-blooded fighter and business man．The rest was a mask．Those who knew him or trafficked with him said that when it came to brass tacks he was Danny-on-the-Spot．He was invariably present at all business discussions，and it was urged by some that his manager was a blind whose only function was to serve as Danny's mouth-piece．

Rivera's way was different．Indian blood，as well as Spanish，was in his veins，and he sat back in a corner，silent，immobile，only his black eyes passing from face to face and noting everything．

“So that's the guy，”Danny said，running an appraising eye over his proposed antagonist．“How de do，old chap．”

Rivera's eyes burned venomously，but he made no sign of acknowledgment．He disliked all Gringos，but this Gringo he hated with an immediacy that was unusual even in him．

“Gawd！”Danny protested facetiously to the promoter．“You ain't expectin' me to fight a deef mute．”When the laughter subsided，he made another hit．“Los Angeles must be on the dink when this is the best you can scare up．What kindergarten did you get 'm from？”

“He's a good little boy，Danny，take it from me，”Roberts defended．“Not as easy as he looks．”

“And half the house is sold already，”Kelly pleaded．“You'll have to take 'm on，Danny．It's the best we can do．”

Danny ran another careless and unflattering glance over Rivera and sighed．“I gotta be easy with 'm，I guess．If only he don't blow up．”

Roberts snorted．

“You gotta be careful，”Danny's manager warned．“No taking chances with a dub that's likely to sneak a lucky one across．”

“Oh，I'll be careful all right，all right，”Danny smiled．“I'll get 'm at the start an'nurse 'm along for the dear public's sake．What d'ye say to fifteen rounds，Kelly—An'then the hay for him？”

“That'll do，”was the answer．“As long as you make it realistic．”

“Then let's get down to biz．”Danny paused and calculated．“Of course，sixty-five per cent．of gate receipts，same as with Carthey．But the split'll be different．Eighty will just about suit me．”And to his manager，“That right？”

The manager nodded．

“Here，you，did you get that？”Kelly asked Rivera．

Rivera shook his head．

“Well，it's this way，”Kelly exposited．“The purse'll be sixty-five per cent．of the gate receipts．You're a dub，and an unknown．You and Danny split，twenty per cent goin' to you，an'eighty to Danny．That's fair，isn't it，Roberts？”

“Very fair，Rivera，”Roberts agreed．“You see，you ain't got a reputation yet．”

“What will sixty-five per cent．of the gate receipts be？”Rivera demanded．

“Oh，maybe five thousand，maybe as high as eight thousand，”Danny broke in to explain．“Something like that．Your share'll come to something like a thousand or sixteen hundred．Pretty good for takin' a licking from a guy with my reputation．What d'ye say？”

Then Rivera took their breaths away．

“Winner takes all，”he said with finality．

A dead silence prevailed．

“It's like candy from a baby，”Danny's manager proclaimed．

Danny shook his head．

“I've been in the game too long，”he explained．“I'm not casting reflections on the referee，or the present company．I'm not sayin' nothing about book-makers an'frame-ups that sometimes happen．But what I do say is that it's poor business for a fighter like me．I play safe．There's no tellin'．Mebbe I break my arm，eh？Or some guy slips me a bunch of dope？”He shook his head solemnly．“Win or lose，eighty is my split．What d'ye say，Mexican？”

Rivera shook his head．

Danny exploded．He was getting down to brass tacks now．

“Why，you dirty little greaser！I've a mind to knock your block off right now．”

Roberts drawled his body to interposition between hostilities．

“Winner takes all，”Rivera repeated sullenly．

“Why do you stand out that way？”Danny asked．

“I can lick you，”was the straight answer．

Danny half started to take off his coat．But，as his manager knew，it was a grand stand play．The coat did not come off，and Danny allowed himself to be placated by the group．Everybody sympathized with him．Rivera stood alone．

“Look here，you little fool，”Kelly took up the argument．“You're nobody．We know what you've been doing the last few months—putting away little local fighters．But Danny is class．His next fight after this will be for the championship．And you're unknown．Nobody ever heard of you out of Los Angeles．”

“They will，”Rivera answered with a shrug，“after this fight．”

“You think for a second you can lick me？”Danny blurted in．

Rivera nodded．

“Oh，come；listen to reason，”Kelly pleaded．“Think of the advertising．”

“I want the money，”was Rivera's answer．

“You couldn't win from me in a thousand years，”Danny assured him．

“Then what are you holding out for？”Rivera countered．“If the money's that easy，why don't you go after it？”

“I will，so help me！”Danny cried with abrupt conviction．“I'll beat you to death in the ring，my boy—you monkeyin' with me this way．Make out the articles，Kelly．Winner take all．Play it up in the sportin' columns．Tell 'em it's a grudge fight．I'll show this fresh kid a few．”

Kelly's secretary had begun to write，when Danny interrupted．

“Hold on！”He turned to Rivera．“Weights？”

“Ringside，”came the answer．

“Not on your life，Fresh Kid．If winner takes all，we weigh in at ten A．M．”

“And winner takes all？”Rivera queried．

Danny nodded．That settled it．He would enter the ring in his full ripeness of strength．

“Weigh in at ten，”Rivera said．

The secretary's pen went on scratching．

“It means five pounds，”Roberts complained to Rivera．“You've given too much away．You've thrown the fight right there．Danny'll be as strong as a bull．You're a fool．He'll lick you sure．You ain't got the chance of a dewdrop in hell．”

Rivera's answer was a calculated look of hatred．Even this Gringo he despised，and him had he found the whitest Gringo of them all．





IV


Barely noticed was Rivera as he entered the ring．Only a very slight and very scattering ripple of half-hearted hand-clapping greeted him．The house did not believe in him．He was the lamb led to slaughter at the hands of the great Danny．Besides，the house was disappointed．It had expected a rushing battle between Danny Ward and Billy Carthey，and here it must put up with this poor little tyro．Still further，it had manifested its disapproval of the change by betting two，and even three，to one on Danny．And where a betting audience's money is，there is its heart．

The Mexican boy sat down in his corner and waited．The slow minutes lagged by．Danny was making him wait．It was an old trick，but ever it worked on the young，new fighters．They grew frightened，sitting thus and facing their own apprehensions and a callous，tobacco-smoking audience．But for once the trick failed．Roberts was right．Rivera had no goat．He，who was more delicately coördinated，more finely nerved and strung than any of them，had no nerves of this sort．The atmosphere of foredoomed defeat in his own corner had no effect on him．His handlers were Gringos and strangers．Also they were scrubs—the dirty driftage of the fight game，without honor，without efficiency．And they were chilled，as well，with certitude that theirs was the losing corner．

“Now you gotta be careful，”Spider Hagerty warned him．Spider was his chief second．“Make it last as long as you can—them's my instructions from Kelly．If you don't，the papers'll call it another bum fight and give the game a bigger black eye in Los Angeles．”

All of which was not encouraging．But Rivera took no notice．He despised prize-fighting．It was the hated game of the hated Gringo．He had taken up with it，as a chopping block for others in the training quarters，solely because he was starving．The fact that he was marvelously made for it，had meant nothing．He hated it．Not until he had come in to the Junta，had he fought for money，and he had found the money easy．Not first among the sons of men had he been to find himself successful at a despised vocation．

He did not analyze．He merely knew that he must win this fight．There could be no other outcome．For behind him，nerving him to this belief，were profounder forces than any the crowded house dreamed．Danny Ward fought for money，and for the easy ways of life that money would bring．But the things Rivera fought for burned in his brain—blazing and terrible visions，that，with eyes wide open，sitting lonely in the corner of the ring and waiting for his tricky antagonist，he saw as clearly as he had lived them．

He saw the white-walled，water-power factories of Rio Blanco．He saw the six thousand workers，starved and wan，and the little children，seven and eight years of age，who toiled long shifts for ten cents a day．He saw the perambulating corpses，the ghastly death's heads of men who labored in the dye-rooms．He remembered that he had heard his father call the dye-rooms the “suicide-holes，”where a year was death．He saw the little patio，and his mother cooking and moiling at crude housekeeping and finding time to caress and love him．And his father he saw，large，big-moustached and deep-chested，kindly above all men，who loved all men and whose heart was so large that there was love to overflowing still left for the mother and the little muchacho playing in the corner of the patio．In those days his name had not been Felipe Rivera．It had been Fernandez，his father's and mother's name．Him had they called Juan．Later，he had changed it himself，for he had found the name of Fernandez hated by prefects of police，jefes politicos，and rurales．

Big，hearty Joaquin Fernandez！A large place he occupied in Rivera's visions．He had not understood at the time，but looking back he could understand．He could see him setting type in the little printery，or scribbling endless hasty，nervous lines on the much-cluttered desk．And he could see the strange evenings，when workmen，coming secretly in the dark like men who did ill deeds，met with his father and talked long hours where he，the muchacho，lay not always asleep in the corner．

As from a remote distance he could hear Spider Hagerty saying to him：“No layin' down at the start．Them's instructions．Take a beatin' an'earn your dough．”

Ten minutes had passed，and he still sat in his corner．There were no signs of Danny，who was evidently playing the trick to the limit．

But more visions burned before the eye of Rivera's memory．The strike，or，rather，the lockout，because the workers of Rio Blanco had helped their striking brothers of Puebla．The hunger，the expeditions in the hills for berries，the roots and herbs that all ate and that twisted and pained the stomachs of all of them．And then，the nightmare；the waste of ground before the company's store；the thousands of starving workers；General Rosalio Martinez and the soldiers of Porfirio Diaz；and the death-spitting rifles that seemed never to cease spitting，while the workers' wrongs were washed and washed again in their own blood．And that night！He saw the flat cars，piled high with the bodies of the slain，consigned to Vera Cruz，food for the sharks of the bay．Again he crawled over the grisly heaps，seeking and finding，stripped and mangled，his father and his mother．His mother he especially remembered—only her face projecting，her body burdened by the weight of dozens of bodies．Again the rifles of the soldiers of Porfirio Diaz cracked，and again he dropped to the ground and slunk away like some hunted coyote of the hills．

To his ears came a great roar，as of the sea，and he saw Danny Ward，leading his retinue of trainers and seconds，coming down the center aisle．The house was in wild uproar for the popular hero who was bound to win．Everybody proclaimed him．Everybody was for him．Even Rivera's own seconds warmed to something akin to cheerfulness when Danny ducked jauntily through the ropes and entered the ring．His face continually spread to an unending succession of smiles，and when Danny smiled he smiled in every feature，even to the laughter-wrinkles of the corners of the eyes and into the depths of the eyes themselves．Never was there so genial a fighter．His face was a running advertisement of good feeling，of good fellowship．He knew everybody．He joked，and laughed，and greeted his friends through the ropes．Those farther away，unable to suppress their admiration，cried loudly：“Oh，you Danny！”It was a joyous ovation of affection that lasted a full five minutes．

Rivera was disregarded．For all that the audience noticed，he did not exist．Spider Hagerty's bloated face bent down close to his．“No gettin' scared，”the Spider warned．“An'remember instructions．You gotta last．No layin' down．If you lay down，we got instructions to beat you up in the dressing rooms．Savve？You just gotta fight．”

The house began to applaud．Danny was crossing the ring to him．Danny bent over，caught Rivera's right hand in both his own and shook it with impulsive heartiness．Danny's smile-wreathed face was close to his．The audience yelled its appreciation of Danny's display of sporting spirit．He was greeting his opponent with the fondness of a brother．Danny's lips moved，and the audience，interpreting the unheard words to be those of a kindly-natured sport，yelled again．Only Rivera heard the low words．

“You little Mexican rat，”hissed from between Danny's gaily smiling lips，“I'll fetch the yellow outa you．”

Rivera made no move．He did not rise．He merely hated with his eyes．

“Get up，you dog！”some man yelled through the ropes from behind．

The crowd began to hiss and boo him for his unsportsmanlike conduct，but he sat unmoved．Another great outburst of applause was Danny's as he walked back across the ring．

When Danny stripped，there was ohs！and ahs！of delight．His body was perfect，alive with easy suppleness and health and strength．The skin was white as a woman's，and as smooth．All grace，and resilience，and power resided therein．He had proved it in scores of battles．His photographs were in all the physical culture magazines．

A groan went up as Spider Hagerty peeled Rivera's sweater over his head．His body seemed leaner，because of the swarthiness of the skin．He had muscles，but they made no display like his opponent's．What the audience neglected to see was the deep chest．Nor could it guess the toughness of the fiber of the flesh，the instantaneousness of the cell explosions of the muscles，the fineness of the nerves that wired every part of him into a splendid fighting mechanism．All the audience saw was a brown-skinned boy of eighteen with what seemed the body of a boy．With Danny it was different．Danny was a man of twenty-four，and his body was a man's body．The contrast was still more striking as they stood together in the center of the ring receiving the referee's last instructions．

Rivera noticed Roberts sitting directly behind the newspaper men．He was drunker than usual，and his speech was correspondingly slower．

“Take it easy，Rivera，”Roberts drawled．“He can't kill you，remember that．He'll rush you at the go-off，but don't get rattled．You just cover up，and stall，and clinch．He can't hurt you much．Just make believe to yourself that he's choppin' out on you at the trainin' quarters．”

Rivera made no sign that he had heard．

“Sullen little devil，”Roberts muttered to the man next to him．“He always was that way．”

But Rivera forgot to look his usual hatred．A vision of countless rifles blinded his eyes．Every face in the audience，far as he could see，to the high dollar-seats，was transformed into a rifle．And he saw the long Mexican border arid and sun-washed and aching，and along it he saw the ragged bands that delayed only for the guns．

Back in his corner he waited，standing up．His seconds had crawled out through the ropes，taking the canvas stool with them．Diagonally across the squared ring，Danny faced him．The gong struck，and the battle was on．The audience howled its delight．Never had it seen a battle open more convincingly．The papers were right．It was a grudge fight．Three-quarters of the distance Danny covered in the rush to get together，his intention to eat up the Mexican lad plainly advertised．He assailed with not one blow，nor two，nor a dozen．He was a gyroscope of blows，a whirlwind of destruction．Rivera was nowhere．He was overwhelmed，buried beneath avalanches of punches delivered from every angle and position by a past master in the art．He was overborne，swept back against the ropes，separated by the referee，and swept back against the ropes again．

It was not a fight．It was a slaughter，a massacre．Any audience，save a prize-fighting one，would have exhausted its emotions in that first minute．Danny was certainly showing what he could do—a splendid exhibition．Such was the certainty of the audience，as well as its excitement and favoritism，that it failed to take notice that the Mexican still stayed on his feet．It forgot Rivera．It rarely saw him，so closely was he enveloped in Danny's man-eating attack．A minute of this went by，and two minutes．Then，in a separation，it caught a clear glimpse of the Mexican．His lip was cut，his nose was bleeding．As he turned and staggered into a clinch，the welts of oozing blood，from his contacts with the ropes，showed in red bars．across his back．But what the audience did not notice was that his chest was not heaving and that his eyes were coldly burning as ever．Too many aspiring champions，in the cruel welter of the training camps，had practiced this man-eating attack on him．He had learned to live through for a compensation of from half a dollar a go up to fifteen dollars a week—a hard school，and he was schooled hard．

Then happened the amazing thing．The whirling，blurring mix-up ceased suddenly．Rivera stood alone．Danny，the redoubtable Danny，lay on his back．His body quivered as consciousness strove to return to it．He had not staggered and sunk down，nor had he gone over in a long slumping fall．The right hook of Rivera had dropped him in midair with the abruptness of death．The referee shoved Rivera back with one hand，and stood over the fallen gladiator counting the seconds．It is the custom of prize-fighting audiences to cheer a clean knock-down blow．But this audience did not cheer．The thing had been too unexpected．It watched the toll of the seconds in tense silence，and through this silence the voice of Roberts rose exultantly：

“I told you he was a two-handed fighter！”

By the fifth second，Danny was rolling over on his face，and when seven was counted，he rested on one knee，ready to rise after the count of nine and before the count of ten．If his knee still touched the floor at “ten，”he was considered “down，”and also “out．”The instant his knee left the floor，he was considered “up，”and in that instant it was Rivera's right to try and put him down again．Rivera took no chances．The moment that knee left the floor he would strike again．He circled around，but the referee circled in between，and Rivera knew that the seconds he counted were very slow．All Gringos were against him，even the referee．

At “nine”the referee gave Rivera a sharp thrust back．It was unfair，but it enabled Danny to rise，the smile back on his lips．Doubled partly over，with arms wrapped about face and abdomen，he cleverly stumbled into a clinch．By all the rules of the game the referee should have broken it，but he did not，and Danny clung on like a surf-battered barnacle and moment by moment recuperated．The last minute of the round was going fast．If he could live to the end，he would have a full minute in his corner to revive．And live to the end he did，smiling through all desperateness and extremity．

“The smile that won't come off！”somebody yelled，and the audience laughed loudly in its relief．

“The kick that Greaser's got is something God-awful，”Danny gasped in his corner to his adviser while his handlers worked frantically over him．

The second and third rounds were tame．Danny，a tricky and consummate ring general，stalled and blocked and held on，devoting himself to recovering from that dazing first-round blow．In the fourth round he was himself again．Jarred and shaken，nevertheless his good condition had enabled him to regain his vigor．But he tried no man-eating tactics．The Mexican had proved a tartar．Instead，he brought to bear his best fighting powers．In tricks and skill and experience he was the master，and though he could land nothing vital，he proceeded scientifically to chop and wear down his opponent．He landed three blows to Rivera's one，but they were punishing blows only，and not deadly．It was the sum of many of them that constituted deadliness．He was respectful of this two-handed dub with the amazing short-arm kicks in both his fists．

In defense，Rivera developed a disconcerting straight-left．Again and again，attack after attack he straight-lefted away from him with accumulated damage to Danny's mouth and nose．But Danny was protean．That was why he was the coming champion．He could change from style to style of fighting at will．He now devoted himself to infighting．In this he was particularly wicked，and it enabled him to avoid the other's straight-left．Here he set the house wild repeatedly，capping it with a marvelous lock-break and lift of an inside uppercut that raised the Mexican in the air and dropped him to the mat．Rivera rested on one knee，making the most of the count，and in the soul of him he knew the referee was counting short seconds on him．

Again，in the seventh，Danny achieved the diabolical inside uppercut．He succeeded only in staggering Rivera，but，in the ensuing moment of defenseless helplessness，he smashed him with another blow through the ropes．Rivera's body bounced on the heads of the newspaper men below，and they boosted him back to the edge of the platform outside the ropes．Here he rested on one knee，while the referee raced off the seconds．Inside the ropes，through which he must duck to enter the ring，Danny waited for him．Nor did the referee intervene or thrust Danny back．

The house was beside itself with delight．

“Kill 'm，Danny，kill 'm！”was the cry．

Scores of voices took it up until it was like a war-chant of wolves．

Danny did his best，but Rivera，at the count of eight，instead of nine，came unexpectedly through the ropes and safely into a clinch．Now the referee worked，tearing him away so that he could be hit，giving Danny every advantage that an unfair referee can give．

But Rivera lived，and the daze cleared from his brain．It was all of a piece．They were the hated Gringos and they were all unfair．And in the worst of it visions continued to flash and sparkle in his brain—long lines of railroad track that simmered across the desert；rurales and American constables；prisons and calabooses；tramps at water tanks—all the squalid and painful panorama of his odyssey after Rio Blanca and the strike．And，resplendent and glorious，he saw the great，red Revolution sweeping across his land．The guns were there before him．Every hated face was a gun．It was for the guns he fought．He was the guns．He was the Revolution．He fought for all Mexico．

The audience began to grow incensed with Rivera．Why didn't he take the licking that was appointed him？Of course he was going to be licked，but why should he be so obstinate about it？Very few were interested in him，and they were the certain，definite percentage of a gambling crowd that plays long shots．Believing Danny to be the winner，nevertheless they had put their money on the Mexican at four to ten and one to three．More than a trifle was up on the point of how many rounds Rivera could last．Wild money had appeared at the ringside proclaiming that he could not last seven rounds，or even six．The winners of this，now that their cash risk was happily settled，had joined in cheering on the favorite．

Rivera refused to be licked．Through the eighth round his opponent strove vainly to repeat the uppercut．In the ninth，Rivera stunned the house again．In the midst of a clinch he broke the lock with a quick，lithe movement，and in the narrow space between their bodies his right lifted from the waist．Danny went to the floor and took the safety of the count．The crowd was appalled．He was being bested at his own game．His famous right-uppercut had been worked back on him．Rivera made no attempt to catch him as he arose at “nine．”The referee was openly blocking that play，though he stood clear when the situation was reversed and it was Rivera who desired to rise．

Twice in the tenth，Rivera put through the right-uppercut，lifted from waist to opponent's chin．Danny grew desperate．The smile never left his face，but he went back to his man-eating rushes．Whirlwind as he would，he could not damage Rivera，while Rivera，through the blur and whirl，dropped him to the mat three times in succession．Danny did not recuperate so quickly now，and by the eleventh round he was in a serious way．But from then till the fourteenth he put up the gamest exhibition of his career．He stalled and blocked，fought parsimoniously，and strove to gather strength．Also，he fought as foully as a successful fighter knows how．Every trick and device he employed，butting in the clinches with the seeming of accident，pinioning Rivera's glove between arm and body，heeling his glove on Rivera's mouth to clog his breathing．Often，in the clinches，through his cut and smiling lips he snarled insults unspeakable and vile in Rivera's ear．Everybody，from the referee to the house，was with Danny and was helping Danny．And they knew what he had in mind．Bested by this surprise-box of an unknown，he was pinning all on a single punch．He offered himself for punishment，fished，and feinted，and drew，for that one opening that would enable him to whip a blow through with all his strength and turn the tide．As another and greater fighter had done before him，he might do—a right and left，to solar plexus and across the jaw．He could do it，for he was noted for the strength of punch that remained in his arms as long as he could keep his feet．

Rivera's seconds were not half-caring for him in the intervals between rounds．Their towels made a showing，but drove little air into his panting lungs．Spider Hagerty talked advice to him，but Rivera knew it was wrong advice．Everybody was against him．He was surrounded by treachery．In the fourteenth round he put Danny down again，and himself stood resting，hands dropped at side，while the referee counted．In the other corner Rivera had been noting suspicious whisperings．He saw Michael Kelly make his way to Roberts and bend and whisper．Rivera's ears were a cat's，desert-trained，and he caught snatches of what was said．He wanted to hear more，and when his opponent arose he maneuvered the fight into a clinch over against the ropes．

“Got to，”he could hear Michael，while Roberts nodded．“Danny's got to win—I stand to lose a mint—I've got a ton of money covered—my own—If he lasts the fifteenth I'm bust—The boy'll mind you．Put something across．”

And thereafter Rivera saw no more visions．They were trying to job him．Once again he dropped Danny and stood resting，his hands at his side．Roberts stood up．

“That settled him，”he said．“Go to your corner．”

He spoke with authority，as he had often spoken to Rivera at the training quarters．But Rivera looked hatred at him and waited for Danny to rise．Back in his corner in the minute interval，Kelly，the promoter，came and talked to Rivera．

“Throw it，damn you，”he rasped in a harsh low voice．“You gotta lay down，Rivera．Stick with me and I'll make your future．I'll let you lick Danny next time．But here's where you lay down．”

Rivera showed with his eyes that he heard，but he made neither sign of assent nor dissent．

“Why don't you speak？”Kelly demanded angrily．

“You lose，anyway，”Spider Hagerty supplemented．“The referee'll take it away from you．Listen to Kelly，and lay down．”

“Lay down，kid，”Kelly pleaded，“and I'll help you to the championship．”

Rivera did not answer．

“I will，so help me，kid．”

At the strike of the gong Rivera sensed something impending．The house did not．Whatever it was it was there inside the ring with him and very close．Danny's earlier surety seemed returned to him．The confidence of his advance frightened Rivera．Some trick was about to be worked．Danny rushed，but Rivera refused the encounter．He side-stepped away into safety．What the other wanted was a clinch．It was in some way necessary to the trick．Rivera backed and circled away，yet he knew，sooner or later，the clinch and the trick would come．Desperately he resolved to draw it．He made as if to effect the clinch with Danny's next rush．Instead，at the last instant，just as their bodies should have come together，Rivera darted nimbly back．And in the same instant Danny's corner raised a cry of foul．Rivera had fooled them．The referee paused irresolutely．The decision that trembled on his lips was never uttered，for a shrill，boy's voice from the gallery piped，“Raw work！”

Danny cursed Rivera openly，and forced him，while Rivera danced away．Also，Rivera made up his mind to strike no more blows at the body．In this he threw away half his chance of winning，but he knew if he was to win at all it was with the outfighting that remained to him．Given the least opportunity，they would lie a foul on him．Danny threw all caution to the winds．For two rounds he tore after and into the boy who dared not meet him at close quarters．Rivera was struck again and again；he took blows by the dozens to avoid the perilous clinch．During this supreme final rally of Danny's the audience rose to its feet and went mad．It did not understand．All it could see was that its favorite was winning after all．

“Why don't you fight？”it demanded wrathfully of Rivera．“You're yellow！You're yellow！”“Open up，you cur！Open up！”“Kill 'm，Danny！Kill 'm！”“You sure got 'm！Kill 'm！”

In all the house，bar none，Rivera was the only cold man．By temperament and blood he was the hottest-passioned there；but he had gone through such vastly greater heats that this collective passion of ten thousand throats，rising surge on surge，was to his brain no more than the velvet cool of a summer twilight．

Into the seventeenth round Danny carried his rally．Rivera，under a heavy blow，drooped and sagged．His hands dropped helplessly as he reeled backward．Danny thought it was his chance．The boy was at，his mercy．Thus Rivera，feigning，caught him off his guard，lashing out a clean drive to the mouth．Danny went down．When he arose，Rivera felled him with a down-chop of the right on neck and jaw．Three times he repeated this．It was impossible for any referee to call these blows foul．

“Oh，Bill！Bill！”Kelly pleaded to the referee．

“I can't，”that official lamented back．“He won't give me a chance．”

Danny，battered and heroic，still kept coming up．Kelly and others near to the ring began to cry out to the police to stop it，though Danny's corner refused to throw in the towel．Rivera saw the fat police captain starting awkwardly to climb through the ropes，and was not sure what it meant．There were so many ways of cheating in this game of the Gringos．Danny，on his feet，tottered groggily and helplessly before him．The referee and the captain were both reaching for Rivera when he struck the last blow．There was no need to stop the fight，for Danny did not rise．

“Count！”Rivera cried hoarsely to the referee．

And when the count was finished，Danny's seconds gathered him up and carried him to his corner．

“Who wins？”Rivera demanded．

Reluctantly，the referee caught his gloved hand and held it aloft．

There were no congratulations for Rivera．He walked to his corner unattended，where his seconds had not yet placed his stool．He leaned backward on the ropes and looked his hatred at them，swept it on and about him till the whole ten thousand Gringos were included．His knees trembled under him，and he was sobbing from exhaustion．Before his eyes the hated faces swayed back and forth in the giddiness of nausea．Then he remembered they were the guns．The guns were his．The Revolution could go on．
